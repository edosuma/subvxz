WEBVTT

00:00.327 --> 00:01.710
My name
is Michael Westen.

00:01.778 --> 00:03.830
I used to be
a spy until...

00:03.914 --> 00:05.558
We got a burn notice on you.

00:05.559 --> 00:07.426
You're blacklisted.

00:07.477 --> 00:09.762
When you're burned,
you've got nothing.

00:09.813 --> 00:12.064
No cash, no credit,
no job history.

00:12.131 --> 00:14.400
You're stuck in whatever city
they decide to dump you in.

00:14.467 --> 00:16.819
- Where am I?
- Miami.

00:16.903 --> 00:19.155
You do whatever work
comes your way.

00:19.239 --> 00:21.323
You rely on anyone
who's still talking to you...

00:22.859 --> 00:23.809
A trigger-happy girlfriend...

00:23.860 --> 00:25.244
Should we shoot them?

00:25.311 --> 00:27.246
An old friend who used
to inform on you to the FBI...

00:27.313 --> 00:29.832
You know spies--
bunch of bitchy little girls.

00:29.916 --> 00:31.250
Family too...

00:31.317 --> 00:32.150
Hey, is that your mom again?

00:32.202 --> 00:33.318
If you're desperate.

00:33.370 --> 00:34.650
Someone needs your help,
Michael.

00:34.671 --> 00:37.423
And a down-and-out spy
you met along the way.

00:37.490 --> 00:38.991
That's how we do it,
people.

00:39.042 --> 00:41.710
Bottom line,
as long as you're burned,

00:41.795 --> 00:44.830
you're not going anywhere.

00:45.354 --> 00:46.787
It's a deep cover job.

00:46.839 --> 00:48.589
We're going after the leader
of a terrorist network.

00:48.641 --> 00:51.175
I need you to bring them down
no matter what.

00:51.260 --> 00:52.593
Two hour notice to get to Cuba

00:52.645 --> 00:54.595
to bust somebody out
of a Russian black site?

00:54.647 --> 00:56.597
It's a woman.
That's all I know.

00:56.649 --> 00:58.182
She must be
pretty damn important.

00:58.267 --> 01:00.184
She could be the key
to what his group is up to.

01:00.269 --> 01:02.403
Pulling Sonya Lebedenko
out of Cuba

01:02.471 --> 01:04.405
puts our operation
on a whole new level.

01:04.473 --> 01:08.809
She's a direct link
to the top of this network.

01:08.861 --> 01:10.828
I want a seat
at the table, Sonya.

01:10.913 --> 01:13.147
I've been working
for your people long enough.

01:13.198 --> 01:14.648
I want to meet
the man in charge.

01:14.700 --> 01:16.617
To do what we do,
you have to be willing

01:16.669 --> 01:18.002
to give up everything.

01:18.087 --> 01:19.653
I have nothing.

01:19.705 --> 01:22.590
My friends, they moved on.

01:22.657 --> 01:25.493
You're the only thing
I have left.

01:25.544 --> 01:29.630
That's one thing
we have in common.

01:31.967 --> 01:35.336
So?

01:37.106 --> 01:40.058
I'll make the call.

01:45.614 --> 01:48.282
In a long-term undercover job,

01:48.350 --> 01:51.018
the most difficult challenges
aren't professional.

01:51.070 --> 01:52.653
They're personal.

01:52.705 --> 01:55.039
You have to try to remember
where the line is

01:55.124 --> 01:56.491
between who you need to be

01:56.542 --> 01:58.626
and who you really are,

01:58.693 --> 02:00.745
because, when that line
starts to blur,

02:00.829 --> 02:03.247
it affects everyone around you.

02:03.332 --> 02:04.966
Hey.

02:05.033 --> 02:06.751
Hey.
Thanks for coming.

02:06.835 --> 02:08.553
What was so urgent
that I had

02:08.637 --> 02:11.589
to run out
in the middle of a job?

02:11.673 --> 02:12.924
There are things
that you need to know

02:13.008 --> 02:14.425
I didn't think could wait.

02:14.510 --> 02:16.344
Here I am.

02:16.395 --> 02:19.063
The mission, getting in
with this organization,

02:19.148 --> 02:20.098
I have a lot riding on it.

02:20.182 --> 02:21.766
I know.

02:21.850 --> 02:24.769
We all do.

02:24.853 --> 02:28.439
Sometimes it's not easy
knowing how far to go

02:28.524 --> 02:30.891
to build trust.

02:30.943 --> 02:33.911
The D.R., Cuba, here.

02:33.996 --> 02:37.115
There are things
I've done,

02:37.199 --> 02:39.200
choices I've had to make.

02:44.406 --> 02:47.842
Last night, Sonya and I...

02:49.428 --> 02:50.545
Fi--

02:50.596 --> 02:53.848
Why are you telling me this,
Michael?

02:53.915 --> 02:57.251
I've asked so much
of you already.

02:57.302 --> 02:59.187
I couldn't ask for you
to be part of this operation

02:59.254 --> 03:01.939
without you knowing everything.

03:02.024 --> 03:03.274
Are you worried
about the operation?

03:03.358 --> 03:07.261
Or are you asking
whether it's okay

03:07.312 --> 03:08.813
for you to sleep
with the enemy?

03:08.897 --> 03:10.281
I mean,
she is still the enemy, right?

03:10.365 --> 03:11.899
The mission hasn't changed.

03:11.950 --> 03:13.868
- Really?
- Yes.

03:13.935 --> 03:15.436
The meeting with the head
of her organization

03:15.487 --> 03:16.454
will happen soon.

03:16.538 --> 03:20.625
You're playing with fire.

03:20.709 --> 03:22.543
But you know that.

03:24.000 --> 03:30.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:41.847 --> 03:43.981
For a spy,
preparing a job history

03:44.066 --> 03:47.518
is a lot more complicated
than updating a resume.

03:47.603 --> 03:49.970
Because official files
are classified,

03:50.022 --> 03:53.024
you have to write a detailed
account of your entire career,

03:53.108 --> 03:54.642
an account that will be checked
and re-checked

03:54.693 --> 03:56.644
for even
the slightest deception.

04:01.333 --> 04:02.816
If you can keep
your facts straight,

04:02.868 --> 04:04.001
you'll be fine.

04:04.086 --> 04:05.453
If you can't,
you might not live

04:05.504 --> 04:06.987
through the process.

04:12.377 --> 04:14.045
Did you finish your homework?

04:14.129 --> 04:15.596
Almost done.
Just making sure

04:15.664 --> 04:17.180
it's complete.

04:17.266 --> 04:20.101
Complete is important.

04:20.168 --> 04:23.387
Everything needs to be in there.
Yeah, about that...

04:23.472 --> 04:25.223
Do I mention last night?

04:25.307 --> 04:28.476
Everything means everything.

04:28.527 --> 04:31.028
I may catch some heat for it,

04:31.113 --> 04:34.899
but the rule is,
you kiss, you tell.

04:34.983 --> 04:37.869
In any infiltration,

04:37.953 --> 04:39.537
becoming comfortable
with your target

04:39.621 --> 04:41.289
is a crucial part
of getting information.

04:41.356 --> 04:43.324
You want them feeling secure

04:43.375 --> 04:45.409
so that your eventual betrayal

04:45.494 --> 04:47.695
will come as a total surprise.

04:47.746 --> 04:50.214
So you said I was meeting
the head of your organization.

04:50.299 --> 04:51.966
You will.

04:52.033 --> 04:54.051
Well, are you going to tell me
where I'm going,

04:54.136 --> 04:57.054
or when I'm supposed
to be there?

04:57.139 --> 05:00.308
We'll take care of that.

05:02.928 --> 05:04.428
Of course that assumes

05:04.513 --> 05:06.113
they don't surprise you first.

05:06.134 --> 05:10.134

05:16.625 --> 05:19.377
- sit down.
- Ow.

05:21.881 --> 05:24.549
Michael Allen Westen, welcome.

05:24.616 --> 05:26.885
My apologies
for the travel arrangements.

05:26.952 --> 05:29.453
Yeah, I would have been
willing to come here

05:29.505 --> 05:32.257
without the 50,000 volts
running through my body.

05:32.308 --> 05:34.625
Necessary precaution.
You understand?

05:34.677 --> 05:36.895
I'm trying.

05:36.962 --> 05:40.732
And you are?

05:40.799 --> 05:43.801
I am the man
you've been waiting to meet.

05:43.853 --> 05:45.186
Do I get a name?

05:45.271 --> 05:47.355
One day.

05:47.439 --> 05:48.740
Perhaps.

05:48.807 --> 05:53.027
But we're not here
to talk about me.

05:53.112 --> 05:55.363
We're here to talk about you.

05:55.447 --> 05:56.998
Is that really necessary?

05:57.082 --> 05:59.250
Everything you want to know
is already in the notes.

05:59.318 --> 06:01.169
Not everything.

06:01.253 --> 06:03.821
But it is a start.

06:03.873 --> 06:06.591
Shall we begin?

06:06.658 --> 06:09.294
What is your full name?
You already know my name.

06:09.345 --> 06:10.879
Seriously, this is a waste
of time.

06:10.963 --> 06:13.631
We have all the time
in the world to get this right.

06:13.682 --> 06:15.600
I proved
what I'm willing to do.

06:15.667 --> 06:17.635
With Burke,
with Sonya.

06:17.686 --> 06:19.503
That should count
for something.

06:19.555 --> 06:21.439
You proved your skills.

06:21.506 --> 06:23.174
And that only gets you
in this room.

06:23.225 --> 06:25.610
This is where we go deeper
than your skills.

06:25.677 --> 06:28.897
This is where you and I
together...

06:28.981 --> 06:31.449
We learn if you are the man
you say you are.

06:31.516 --> 06:35.236
Now, what is your full name?

06:40.075 --> 06:44.695
My name
is Michael Allen Westen.

06:44.747 --> 06:46.697
An interrogation
is all about rhythm

06:46.749 --> 06:48.366
and repetition.

06:48.417 --> 06:51.002
Experienced interrogators
will establish the pace

06:51.053 --> 06:53.554
of questioning
to establish control.

06:53.639 --> 06:56.925
But when were you recruited by
the Central Intelligence Agency?

06:57.009 --> 06:59.477
During my deployment
in Panama three weeks later,

06:59.544 --> 07:01.262
I was sent to the Farm.

07:01.347 --> 07:03.264
And describe your relationship
with Mr. Card.

07:03.349 --> 07:05.099
He betrayed me,
so I killed him.

07:05.184 --> 07:06.684
Once they have control,

07:06.735 --> 07:09.354
they can probe
for more detailed information,

07:09.405 --> 07:12.523
exactly where you've been
and what you've done.

07:12.574 --> 07:15.076
First time that you worked
with Sam Axe?

07:15.160 --> 07:18.229
No, we met during
a hostage rescue in Bolivia.

07:18.280 --> 07:22.834
Would you like me to go over
the details of that mission?

07:22.901 --> 07:24.202
No, that's enough for now.

07:29.258 --> 07:31.509
Techniques
such as sleep deprivation,

07:31.576 --> 07:34.879
noise irritation,
and sensory overload are used

07:34.947 --> 07:40.551
to disorient you, to make it
harder to resist questioning.

07:40.602 --> 07:42.753
The Geneva Convention
doesn't consider these methods

07:42.805 --> 07:45.723
to be torture, but
when you're experiencing them,

07:45.774 --> 07:48.643
it sure feels like it.

07:51.313 --> 07:54.732
The idea is that,
the more worn out you become,

07:54.783 --> 07:57.268
the more likely you are
to make a mistake

07:57.319 --> 07:59.737
your interrogator
can pounce on.

07:59.788 --> 08:01.439
I want to talk to you
about Africa.

08:01.490 --> 08:06.444
You were there to negotiate
oil interests for the CIA.

08:06.495 --> 08:08.746
What were the names
of the warlords

08:08.797 --> 08:10.331
who received payoffs?

08:10.416 --> 08:13.451
Kwame Alaka
and Chidi Buhari.

08:13.502 --> 08:17.388
Now before you said
you negotiated with three.

08:17.456 --> 08:18.456
Now it's just two.

08:18.507 --> 08:24.145
I negotiated with...

08:24.229 --> 08:27.181
Three.

08:27.266 --> 08:31.069
But the third never received
the payoff.

08:31.136 --> 08:34.322
My burn notice
interrupted the deal.

08:38.777 --> 08:41.578
But at a certain point,
keeping your story straight

08:41.645 --> 08:43.648
is next to impossible
when you're also struggling

08:43.716 --> 08:46.284
to maintain your sanity.

08:56.462 --> 08:59.597
Rrah!
Rrrah!

08:59.664 --> 09:02.216
No, the Charlie-Rex
did it again.

09:02.301 --> 09:03.885
Hi, Uncle Jesse.

09:03.969 --> 09:06.003
Hey, Maddie.
Charl-ay!

09:06.055 --> 09:07.055
Hey, you better watch
those Raptors, man.

09:07.139 --> 09:09.840
They look a little hungry.

09:09.892 --> 09:11.275
Did you come by
to play dinosaurs?

09:11.343 --> 09:12.843
No. Not quite.
I was hoping you knew

09:12.895 --> 09:14.512
where Mike was.
Presently, no.

09:14.563 --> 09:15.763
Why don't you try calling him?

09:15.814 --> 09:18.032
I did.
He hasn't hit me back.

09:18.117 --> 09:20.184
I thought he might be here.

09:20.235 --> 09:21.986
So he hasn't called
or left any messages

09:22.037 --> 09:23.521
or anything like that?

09:23.572 --> 09:24.789
No.
That's not unusual.

09:24.856 --> 09:27.024
He disappeared
for nine months, remember?

09:27.076 --> 09:28.459
Yeah, you're right.
You're right.

09:28.527 --> 09:29.860
He probably just got busy,

09:29.912 --> 09:32.863
forgot to check in.

09:34.800 --> 09:37.635
Jesse.

09:43.642 --> 09:45.393
What is going on?
Is Michael in trouble?

09:45.477 --> 09:47.311
No.
No, it's like you said.

09:47.379 --> 09:49.547
He's not the easiest guy
to get a hold of these days.

09:49.598 --> 09:51.315
You have
a terrible poker face.

09:51.383 --> 09:53.184
Don't make me yell at you
in front of Charlie.

09:53.218 --> 09:54.885
Just tell me.

09:54.937 --> 09:58.055
He's been missing
since Thursday.

09:58.107 --> 09:59.857
We know he was going to meet
with the head

09:59.908 --> 10:02.393
of the organization
he's trying to take down,

10:02.444 --> 10:03.995
but then he just dropped
off the grid.

10:04.062 --> 10:05.413
What does that mean,
"dropped off the grid?"

10:05.497 --> 10:06.831
What happened?

10:06.898 --> 10:08.166
That's what we're trying
to find out.

10:08.233 --> 10:09.417
Sam and Fi are out looking
for him right now.

10:09.501 --> 10:10.785
If he gets in contact
with you, call me.

10:10.869 --> 10:12.203
Okay?
Please.

10:12.254 --> 10:15.256
Jesse,
if Michael's missing,

10:15.340 --> 10:17.241
just tell me what to do.

10:17.292 --> 10:19.677
Just stay here,
take care of Charlie.

10:19.744 --> 10:21.963
We'll find him.

10:22.047 --> 10:24.982
Be good, Charlie.

10:28.687 --> 10:30.254
All right,
I checked the storage space,

10:30.305 --> 10:32.273
the emergency spot,
no sign of Mike.

10:32.357 --> 10:35.276
Any action at the loft?

10:35.360 --> 10:36.644
Sonya and friend
just showed up

10:36.728 --> 10:38.863
and started dragging things
out of there.

10:44.119 --> 10:45.736
Okay, so first
Mike disappears,

10:45.787 --> 10:47.705
then Sonya shows up
with a clean car

10:47.772 --> 10:48.932
emptying
all of his stuff out.

10:48.957 --> 10:50.158
We gotta do something.

10:50.242 --> 10:51.522
We're not supposed
to do anything

10:51.543 --> 10:52.827
that will jeopardize the Op.

10:52.911 --> 10:55.913
We're supposed to just lay low,
let this play out.

10:55.964 --> 10:58.332
Do you know what "lay low"
means in CIA speak?

10:58.417 --> 11:01.969
See if somebody dies.

11:02.054 --> 11:05.006
Look, Strong didn't say we
couldn't keep an eye on Sonya.

11:05.090 --> 11:06.841
Let's take my car,
we'll follow her,

11:06.925 --> 11:09.644
and see if she leads us
to Michael.

11:09.728 --> 11:11.429
All right, fine.

11:11.480 --> 11:15.650
I just hope Mike is in one piece
when we find him.

11:25.277 --> 11:27.161
Stop!

11:27.246 --> 11:29.647
Just...stop!

11:29.698 --> 11:32.316
All right?
Michael, calm down.

11:34.336 --> 11:37.288
We're done with this.

11:37.339 --> 11:38.989
So this is over?

11:39.041 --> 11:40.708
The first part, yes.

11:45.180 --> 11:47.465
Set our sights
on new horizons.

11:47.516 --> 11:49.350
This is gonna loosen you up.

11:53.972 --> 11:59.393
It's a chemical relative
of benzodiazepine...

11:59.478 --> 12:02.697
mixed with
a synthetic hallucinogen.

12:02.781 --> 12:05.283
Drugs will only make this
more complicated.

12:05.350 --> 12:06.911
I'll tell you whatever
you want to know.

12:06.952 --> 12:11.038
Yes, you will.

12:11.123 --> 12:13.374
Trust the process, Michael.

12:13.458 --> 12:16.210
You might be surprised
at what we discover.

12:16.295 --> 12:18.045
Give me your hand.

12:18.130 --> 12:21.215
We'll go through this together.

12:21.300 --> 12:24.802
Give me your hand.

12:27.422 --> 12:29.473
I'm not gonna lie to you.

12:29.541 --> 12:32.810
This is gonna hit you
pretty hard...

12:32.877 --> 12:34.878
And you're not gonna be able
to tell the difference

12:34.930 --> 12:37.848
between what is real
and what is not real.

12:40.319 --> 12:43.104
Trick is not to resist.

12:43.188 --> 12:44.939
Just lean into it.

12:50.279 --> 12:53.447
We'll reconvene in a few hours.

13:18.423 --> 13:20.257
Who is it?

13:23.478 --> 13:25.146
Fi?

13:25.230 --> 13:27.365
Michael.

13:27.432 --> 13:31.402
How are you here?

13:31.453 --> 13:34.938
I'm not here.

13:34.990 --> 13:37.658
Fi, I...I can't take it.

13:37.743 --> 13:42.463
I can't take any more.

13:42.547 --> 13:48.085
Yes, you can.

13:48.136 --> 13:51.472
Yours isn't the only life
on the line.

13:51.556 --> 13:56.010
If you tell them everything...
we all die.

13:56.094 --> 13:57.645
I know.

13:57.729 --> 13:59.680
The drugs are so strong.

13:59.765 --> 14:01.799
I can't take it much more.

14:01.850 --> 14:02.933
Yes, you can.

14:02.984 --> 14:07.855
Help me.
I need you.

14:07.939 --> 14:11.308
No...You don't need me.

14:11.360 --> 14:14.829
I do.

14:14.913 --> 14:16.113
I need you.

14:16.164 --> 14:19.834
If you tell them everything,
we all die.

14:22.921 --> 14:25.339
Come back.

14:25.424 --> 14:27.291
Come back!

14:31.158 --> 14:34.727
If you're given psychoactive
drugs during an interrogation,

14:34.795 --> 14:36.062
it doesn't automatically
make you spill

14:36.130 --> 14:38.430
every secret you've ever had.

14:38.482 --> 14:41.067
Drugs are you used less
to make you tell the truth

14:41.118 --> 14:44.120
than to make it hard to lie.

14:51.611 --> 14:53.079
Without a clear head,
it's difficult

14:53.130 --> 14:55.281
to make up a story
and stick to it.

14:55.332 --> 14:56.372
Don't fight this, Michael.

14:56.383 --> 15:00.503
Relax, breathe.

15:00.587 --> 15:03.389
Look at me.
Look at me.

15:03.456 --> 15:05.675
There you are.
Water.

15:05.759 --> 15:09.929
We've learned a lot about you,
what you've done.

15:09.980 --> 15:11.898
But for my purposes,

15:11.965 --> 15:15.301
the what is less important
than the why.

15:15.352 --> 15:17.520
It's in there.
It's all in there.

15:17.604 --> 15:19.989
Well, we've gone over it.

15:20.073 --> 15:24.143
You've given me the names,
the places, a little history.

15:24.194 --> 15:27.646
But now we need
to go much deeper.

15:27.698 --> 15:32.034
We need to find out how you
became the man you are today.

15:32.119 --> 15:34.921
I don't understand.

15:34.988 --> 15:37.039
Here's what I'm curious about,
Michael.

15:37.124 --> 15:42.094
When the CIA recruited you,
your test scores were good.

15:42.162 --> 15:45.014
Your field work?
Strong enough.

15:45.098 --> 15:48.167
But then when you were operating
in Eastern Europe,

15:48.218 --> 15:49.886
you elevated your game.

15:49.970 --> 15:52.188
You went from a slightly
above average operative

15:52.272 --> 15:54.173
to a living legend.

15:54.224 --> 15:56.776
Now...How does that happen?
I followed orders.

15:56.843 --> 15:58.110
I did what I had to do.

15:58.178 --> 16:00.112
It just happened.
I don't think so.

16:00.180 --> 16:03.515
The CIA would never give
the highest priority operations

16:03.567 --> 16:06.619
to the Michael Westen
that they recruited.

16:06.686 --> 16:10.907
You evolved into something
that they never expected.

16:10.991 --> 16:14.911
Something inside of you,
it shifted.

16:14.995 --> 16:17.663
What was it?
What do you think it was?

16:17.714 --> 16:21.968
My training kicked in.

16:22.035 --> 16:23.636
Look at my time in Kiev.

16:23.703 --> 16:27.423
That many high-risk Ops
in seven months,

16:27.507 --> 16:30.309
you grow stronger or you die.

16:30.377 --> 16:33.262
Gradual improvements that come
with training and experience

16:33.347 --> 16:35.547
had something to do with it,
but that is only

16:35.599 --> 16:37.049
the icing on the cake.

16:46.059 --> 16:49.228
What's happening?
What are you seeing?

16:50.864 --> 16:52.531
I don't--I don't know.

16:52.583 --> 16:55.618
I--

17:00.958 --> 17:04.794
Michael...

17:07.681 --> 17:10.766
You only need
to put yourself there

17:10.851 --> 17:12.602
to find the answers.

17:18.942 --> 17:20.925
They're talking
about me, kid.

17:20.978 --> 17:23.396
I am the answer.

17:23.446 --> 17:25.948
No, no, no, no, no.

17:26.032 --> 17:29.235
I'm the only one who ever
really believed in you.

17:29.286 --> 17:31.103
I made you.

17:31.154 --> 17:32.705
That is not true.

17:32.772 --> 17:35.207
Aww, the hell it isn't.
You can't lie to me, kid.

17:35.275 --> 17:37.743
I am in your head.

17:37.794 --> 17:40.880
You know exactly how much time
and effort I put into you.

17:40.947 --> 17:43.633
- You didn't do anything.
- Oh, please.

17:43.717 --> 17:47.286
Everyone thought you had
the heart of a boy scout.

17:47.337 --> 17:51.290
But I saw your true colors.

17:51.341 --> 17:55.761
I discovered
that homegrown anger,

17:55.812 --> 17:58.314
the resentment,
all that stuff

17:58.398 --> 18:00.516
you kept bottled up
inside of you,

18:00.600 --> 18:04.153
and I taught you
how to use it.

18:04.237 --> 18:06.155
Oh, you're welcome,
by the way.

18:06.239 --> 18:08.107
You don't know
what you're saying.

18:08.158 --> 18:10.443
Oh, I know exactly
what I'm saying.

18:10.494 --> 18:13.279
I was there, kid.

18:13.330 --> 18:15.147
I remember how fast
you took to it,

18:15.198 --> 18:19.251
how much you loved it.

18:19.319 --> 18:22.821
You are not real.
Get out of here.

18:22.873 --> 18:25.541
You show some goddamn respect
for the dead!

18:25.625 --> 18:27.843
I'm not asking
for a candlelight vigil,

18:27.928 --> 18:31.130
but at least honor my untimely
passing by admitting the truth.

18:31.181 --> 18:33.832
You are who I made you!

18:33.884 --> 18:37.836
And that is all I ever wanted,
Michael...

18:37.888 --> 18:43.192
For you to accept who you are.

18:43.276 --> 18:44.477
- You're wrong!
- Who's wrong?

18:44.528 --> 18:46.696
Who's there?
I don't know.

18:46.780 --> 18:48.698
I just--

18:48.782 --> 18:50.616
It's the drug.
I'm not thinking straight.

18:50.683 --> 18:53.452
Michael,
don't think straight.

18:53.520 --> 18:57.823
Just let whatever floats
through your mind

18:57.874 --> 19:00.192
come out unfiltered,

19:00.243 --> 19:01.544
and you focus
on the question.

19:01.628 --> 19:06.465
How did you become
the CIA's ace?

19:06.533 --> 19:09.802
Just tell him.

19:09.869 --> 19:11.470
Stop it.
Stop it.

19:11.538 --> 19:12.922
Stop
- come on.

19:13.006 --> 19:16.175
What's the harm in giving credit
where credit is due?

19:16.226 --> 19:19.044
Stop it! Stop it!
It's in the past!

19:19.096 --> 19:21.897
This doesn't matter!
Oh, yes, it does.

19:21.982 --> 19:24.233
It matters to you.

19:24.317 --> 19:26.268
Otherwise we wouldn't be here
together.

19:26.353 --> 19:27.719
Now just let it out.

19:27.771 --> 19:29.822
Just stop!

19:29.889 --> 19:31.607
What?

19:31.691 --> 19:33.492
Oh, you think
he's gonna hate you

19:33.560 --> 19:36.328
if he knows
who you really are?

19:36.396 --> 19:38.497
Come on, tell him
how much fun we had.

19:38.565 --> 19:41.400
That's what he wants.

19:41.451 --> 19:46.288
Say my name, and I promise you
you'll feel better.

19:46.373 --> 19:48.541
Say it, kid.

19:48.592 --> 19:52.545
Say my name!

19:52.596 --> 19:55.264
Larry!

19:59.803 --> 20:03.389
Well, isn't that interesting?

20:03.440 --> 20:06.758
There's a Larry Sizemore
in your notes...

20:06.810 --> 20:10.563
Listed as a field officer.

20:10.614 --> 20:12.615
But that's all.

20:12.699 --> 20:14.316
Nothing special.

20:14.401 --> 20:19.488
He was a special...
Special kind of monster.

20:19.573 --> 20:24.276
Well, you worked
with plenty of monsters.

20:24.327 --> 20:25.995
What was so special
about this one?

20:26.079 --> 20:29.215
He was dangerous,

20:29.282 --> 20:30.782
and I was afraid.

20:30.834 --> 20:34.386
What were you afraid of?

20:34.454 --> 20:39.558
I was afraid
I was becoming like him.

20:39.626 --> 20:44.063
And I was afraid
I was starting to like it.

20:52.856 --> 20:56.826
Finally,
we're making progress.

21:15.161 --> 21:16.929
I don't see her, Sam.

21:16.996 --> 21:19.048
I'm telling you, Fi,
she pulled in here.

21:19.132 --> 21:20.499
Well,
we should get moving.

21:20.550 --> 21:21.550
The longer we wait,
the further she'll--

21:21.635 --> 21:24.637
Hey, right there.
Bingo!

21:24.688 --> 21:27.773
- What the hell is she doing?
- She's gonna burn Mike's stuff.

21:27.840 --> 21:29.358
There's an incinerator
in there.

21:29.442 --> 21:31.861
Fi, we can't lose her again.
We got to stay closer.

21:31.945 --> 21:34.396
I have some skip tracing
equipment in the trunk.

21:34.481 --> 21:35.681
If we plant something
in her car--

21:35.732 --> 21:37.783
No, Fi, you know,
how thorough she is.

21:37.850 --> 21:39.485
If she sweeps her car
for trackers

21:39.536 --> 21:40.619
and finds something,
this is over.

21:40.687 --> 21:41.853
Who said anything
about trackers?

21:41.905 --> 21:43.372
I have an infrared strobe
we can use.

21:43.456 --> 21:44.790
Well, it's a great idea,
but that means you got to get

21:44.857 --> 21:47.493
access to the car,
a decent power source.

21:47.544 --> 21:49.795
Have a little faith,
Sam.

21:56.836 --> 21:58.420
How am I looking?
Pretty good for now,

21:58.505 --> 21:59.889
but keep moving.

21:59.973 --> 22:02.758
They're gonna run out of stuff
to burn pretty soon.

22:05.044 --> 22:07.646
And where the hell did you get
an I.R. strobe, anyway?

22:07.714 --> 22:08.880
Isn't that
a military toy?

22:08.932 --> 22:10.849
I'm a one-woman army.

22:10.901 --> 22:13.051
Strobe's in place.

22:13.103 --> 22:14.987
Okay.

22:16.990 --> 22:18.741
All right.

22:18.825 --> 22:20.826
Rudolph might be out of a job.
It's shining bright.

22:22.562 --> 22:24.613
Fi, you got company.
Get out of there now.

22:24.698 --> 22:26.782
- One more bolt.
- Fi, I'm tellin' you,

22:26.866 --> 22:28.500
you got, like, ten seconds
and then

22:28.568 --> 22:31.287
they're gonna be close enough
to help you finish.

22:45.917 --> 22:48.311
All right, Fi, get back here.
We gotta move.

22:50.548 --> 22:52.549
So I looked into your friend,
Larry.

22:52.600 --> 22:55.185
Must say that the files
I pulled on your Ops together

22:55.252 --> 22:59.106
were...
very, very intriguing.

22:59.190 --> 23:01.141
Here's what we need,
Michael--

23:01.225 --> 23:04.611
we need to understand
who he was to you.

23:06.864 --> 23:08.765
What do you want
to know?

23:08.816 --> 23:11.434
Why did you and Larry
stop working together?

23:11.486 --> 23:16.373
I already told you.

23:16.440 --> 23:20.877
Well, you can't deny
that you were a powerful team,

23:20.945 --> 23:25.165
and the CIA wouldn't let you
split up without good reason.

23:25.249 --> 23:27.134
I was needed
in the Middle East,

23:27.218 --> 23:29.669
so that's where I went.

23:29.754 --> 23:35.175
Talk to me about Vedeno,
November, '95.

23:35.259 --> 23:37.677
What happened there?

23:37.762 --> 23:41.398
You and Larry were never
on record working together again

23:41.465 --> 23:44.151
after that Op.
Talk me about that.

23:44.235 --> 23:48.137
- Recon mission.
- Recon?

23:48.189 --> 23:50.073
Then why were you
sent home

23:50.140 --> 23:52.526
six months before your posting
was finished?

23:52.610 --> 23:55.412
I made
a tactical mistake.

23:55.479 --> 23:58.448
What'd that mistake
look like?

23:58.499 --> 24:02.485
We trusted
a local military commander,

24:02.537 --> 24:03.870
but he betrayed us.

24:03.955 --> 24:05.822
Oh, so you got played
by an asset.

24:05.873 --> 24:08.625
Ops have gone bad
on you before.

24:08.676 --> 24:11.878
What makes this one
so unique?

24:19.720 --> 24:21.221
Michael.

24:21.305 --> 24:22.305
Michael?

24:22.356 --> 24:24.024
Michael!

24:24.108 --> 24:26.109
Pay attention!

24:26.176 --> 24:29.446
You and Larry,
betrayed by your contact,

24:29.513 --> 24:31.314
then what?

24:31.365 --> 24:34.684
We had to find him.

24:34.735 --> 24:39.239
The intel he had
could expose everyone.

24:39.323 --> 24:41.291
That bastard.

24:41.358 --> 24:42.792
He couldn't have gotten far.

24:42.860 --> 24:45.695
Let's move.

24:47.665 --> 24:51.751
We tracked him down.
Standard Op.

24:51.836 --> 24:54.137
Locate, corner,
neutralize.

24:54.204 --> 24:56.556
Now you're just
parroting orders.

24:56.641 --> 24:59.726
What did you and Larry do?

24:59.810 --> 25:03.513
Ah, kid,
it happened.

25:03.564 --> 25:05.432
You know, you can deny it
all you want,

25:05.516 --> 25:10.053
but nothing is gonna
change the facts.

25:10.104 --> 25:12.739
Why don't you want
to talk about it?

25:12.823 --> 25:16.159
Hey, you know, these--
these were our glory days.

25:16.226 --> 25:18.394
This was beautiful.

25:18.446 --> 25:20.413
This was something
to be proud of.

25:20.498 --> 25:22.065
Get out of my head,
Larry.

25:22.116 --> 25:23.396
I'm not listening to you
anymore.

25:26.921 --> 25:30.507
Ah, don't look at me
like that.

25:30.574 --> 25:33.960
These...
Are not innocents.

25:34.045 --> 25:37.413
They were hiding an enemy.
Our enemy!

25:37.465 --> 25:39.105
That wasn't how
it was supposed to happen!

25:39.133 --> 25:43.687
What happened?
What happened, tell me.

25:43.754 --> 25:46.189
We interrogated
the villagers.

25:46.256 --> 25:47.337
They had helped him escape.

25:47.358 --> 25:49.059
They were just farmers.

25:49.110 --> 25:52.812
Didn't take long to figure out
where they had hid him.

25:52.897 --> 25:55.282
He had barricaded himself
inside of a factory.

25:55.366 --> 25:58.151
He doesn't want
tactical details.

25:58.235 --> 26:00.820
He's not gonna stop until you
give him what's inside!

26:00.905 --> 26:02.789
It was too risky
to breach and extract,

26:02.873 --> 26:04.874
so we neutralized
the situation.

26:04.942 --> 26:07.294
Damn it!
Again, with "neutralize"!

26:07.378 --> 26:10.380
For the love of God,
use real words!

26:10.447 --> 26:12.248
The man was hiding
like a coward!

26:12.300 --> 26:15.085
Was it worth risking our lives
to silence him?

26:15.136 --> 26:18.672
Hell, no!
So tell him how you solved it.

26:18.756 --> 26:21.057
Tell him what you did.

26:23.511 --> 26:26.846
I blew it up.
I blew up the building.

26:26.931 --> 26:30.233
That what's bothering you,
is that you blew up a building.

26:30.300 --> 26:32.819
There is more to it
than that.

26:32.903 --> 26:35.355
You're safe here,
you can tell me.

26:35.439 --> 26:39.326
Go on.
Come on.

26:39.410 --> 26:41.444
Tell him why
you ran away from me.

26:41.495 --> 26:43.312
I didn't know
there were people in there.

26:43.364 --> 26:45.832
Stop right there.
You knew.

26:45.916 --> 26:48.535
- I couldn't see inside!
- Are you kidding me?

26:48.619 --> 26:49.819
You could have looked
through the window.

26:49.870 --> 26:51.955
You could have counted cars
in the lot!

26:52.006 --> 26:54.007
But you didn't!

26:54.091 --> 26:55.992
No, you want to try and play
the boy scout and tell yourself,

26:56.043 --> 26:58.044
"oh, it was an accident,"
but I know better,

26:58.129 --> 26:59.546
'cause I saw the look
in your eye,

26:59.630 --> 27:02.932
that killer instinct.
You knew they were there!

27:03.000 --> 27:06.052
I didn't care!

27:08.973 --> 27:11.057
I lost control,
I was angry.

27:11.142 --> 27:13.860
My friends--
my friends were gonna die.

27:17.531 --> 27:19.816
I didn't care what it took
or who stood in my way,

27:19.867 --> 27:22.518
I was gonna make sure
that son of a bitch was dead.

27:22.570 --> 27:25.121
I let my feelings
blind me.

27:30.995 --> 27:32.712
I never wanted that
to happen again.

27:36.584 --> 27:39.386
And that is why...

27:42.339 --> 27:46.209
You always get the job done
without collateral damage.

27:46.260 --> 27:51.014
The people...
In the factory,

27:51.065 --> 27:52.732
sometimes,
I hear them scream.

27:52.817 --> 27:56.519
They never stop.

27:56.570 --> 28:00.073
They can get quieter,
but they never stop.

28:00.157 --> 28:02.275
Michael,
I want you to understand,

28:02.359 --> 28:04.444
what you've done here today,
it's very important,

28:04.528 --> 28:05.912
because I can't protect you
unless I know

28:05.996 --> 28:08.448
what's driving you.

28:08.532 --> 28:11.868
You share your burden...

28:11.919 --> 28:13.620
I will help you carry it.

28:13.704 --> 28:17.507
Now, you get some rest
because it is clear to me

28:17.574 --> 28:19.959
there are more demons
inside of you,

28:20.044 --> 28:25.131
and I will do whatever it takes
to dig them out.

28:30.448 --> 28:31.915
A spy is trained

28:31.982 --> 28:34.317
to deal with a wide range
of external threats--

28:34.385 --> 28:38.688
combat, pursuit, capture,
interrogation, even torture.

28:38.756 --> 28:40.473
Training is designed
to expose you

28:40.558 --> 28:42.392
to as many situations
as possible

28:42.459 --> 28:47.063
so that when you encounter them
in the real world, you're ready.

28:47.131 --> 28:51.234
There are situations, though,
you simply can't prepare for.

28:51.301 --> 28:54.237
No amount of experience
or training can help you

28:54.304 --> 28:57.306
when the threat comes
from inside your own mind.

28:58.909 --> 29:01.361
Frank, stop it, you're drunk.
Just calm down!

29:01.445 --> 29:03.530
Nate, go next door, now.

29:03.614 --> 29:04.998
He'll hurt you.

29:05.082 --> 29:06.482
No, he won't.
I'll be fine.

29:06.534 --> 29:08.334
- No.
- Go.

29:08.419 --> 29:11.287
Get outta my way, bitch!

29:11.338 --> 29:13.123
Ugh!

29:22.299 --> 29:24.834
- You still have eyes on Sonya?
- I sure do.

29:24.885 --> 29:28.138
She just took a right
on 5th.

29:28.189 --> 29:30.440
Traffic is light on 4th.

29:30.507 --> 29:31.775
Take a right here,
we'll pick her up again.

29:31.842 --> 29:33.176
Damn it, red light.

29:33.227 --> 29:34.360
What,
is that a problem?

29:34.445 --> 29:36.780
No, more of a warning.

29:36.847 --> 29:40.283
Oh!
Oh, Fi, what the hell?

29:41.819 --> 29:43.653
Jesus, Fi!

29:48.459 --> 29:49.626
You see her?

29:49.693 --> 29:51.628
We should be going
parallel to her now.

29:51.695 --> 29:52.879
Nothing yet.
It'd be a lot easier

29:52.963 --> 29:54.414
if you weren't driving
like Mario Andretti.

29:54.498 --> 29:55.665
What are you talking
about?

29:55.716 --> 29:58.468
Mario Andretti
never had a car like this.

30:02.840 --> 30:03.706
There she is,
go left.

30:13.217 --> 30:14.934
Okay.

30:15.019 --> 30:18.554
I think my liver's in my throat,
but...good job, Fi.

30:22.993 --> 30:25.161
What's on the other side
of that gate?

30:25.229 --> 30:28.581
Looks like a road
that leads to a private island.

30:28.666 --> 30:31.234
I don't know
if we can stay with Sonya.

30:31.285 --> 30:33.503
Those guards could tip her off
if we try to get by.

30:33.570 --> 30:35.955
All right,
well, how about this? Look...

30:36.040 --> 30:37.907
See how the island
juts out to the harbor?

30:37.958 --> 30:40.543
I think our best view
of the place is from the water.

30:40.594 --> 30:42.762
- You're proposing we swim?
- No, we don't have to get wet.

30:42.847 --> 30:44.130
Elsa owns a speedboat.

30:44.215 --> 30:45.715
It's docked
on the other side of the bay.

30:45.766 --> 30:47.550
Maybe Jesse can come
and pick us up.

30:47.601 --> 30:49.919
I'll just call Elsa
and set it up.

30:49.970 --> 30:51.888
Fine, but hurry.

30:51.939 --> 30:54.557
I don't like the thought
of Michael in there alone.

30:58.762 --> 31:01.281
Relax.

31:01.365 --> 31:02.365
Breathe.

31:07.538 --> 31:09.405
There.

31:11.292 --> 31:13.960
One of the reasons
you are here is because

31:14.044 --> 31:19.165
your career is marked
with an extraordinary degree...

31:19.250 --> 31:22.051
of loyalty.

31:22.119 --> 31:26.756
Loyalty...
to the agency.

31:26.807 --> 31:29.292
Loyalty
to your fellow operatives.

31:29.343 --> 31:31.294
Loyalty
to your friends.

31:31.345 --> 31:34.430
That is a good thing...

31:34.481 --> 31:37.400
But it's also a problem.

31:37.467 --> 31:39.736
Old loyalties die hard.

31:39.803 --> 31:42.972
And I need to know
that you've left yours behind.

31:46.160 --> 31:48.745
They are.
I'm all alone.

31:48.812 --> 31:50.697
That's an easy thing to say.

31:50.781 --> 31:52.198
'Cause I know how hard
it can be

31:52.283 --> 31:53.983
to cut ties.

31:54.034 --> 31:55.835
Especially when you've
been in the game

31:55.920 --> 31:57.987
as long as you have.

31:58.038 --> 32:02.091
Look at the work I've done
with Sonya and Burke.

32:02.159 --> 32:04.493
I've been loyal to you.

32:04.545 --> 32:06.095
You were useful to us.

32:06.163 --> 32:08.497
I'm grateful for that.

32:08.549 --> 32:12.018
But when Burke found you,

32:12.102 --> 32:13.886
you needed something.

32:13.971 --> 32:16.055
Something to hold on to.

32:16.140 --> 32:18.274
We gave you that.

32:18.342 --> 32:20.193
Loyalty and need--
they're not the same thing.

32:20.277 --> 32:21.728
You don't know our cause.

32:21.812 --> 32:24.680
You can't blindly
dedicate yourself to something

32:24.732 --> 32:26.115
that quickly.

32:26.183 --> 32:27.683
Not yet, anyway.

32:29.820 --> 32:32.238
Michael...

32:32.323 --> 32:34.857
If you're a part
of something else...

32:34.908 --> 32:36.192
then you need to tell me.

32:36.243 --> 32:38.044
Michael!

32:39.713 --> 32:42.081
Michael!
Where the hell are you?

32:47.554 --> 32:49.756
Michael.

32:49.840 --> 32:50.807
Michael?

32:52.009 --> 32:53.926
I know it's hard.

32:54.011 --> 32:56.429
Just trust me.

32:56.513 --> 32:59.482
It is better for both of us
if you just tell me now.

32:59.549 --> 33:00.516
Michael!

33:01.685 --> 33:03.219
Michael!

33:03.270 --> 33:05.554
Damn it, look at me
when I am talking to you, son!

33:05.606 --> 33:06.555
Dad?

33:10.861 --> 33:13.112
You can't be here.

33:13.197 --> 33:15.281
Why?
'Cause I'm dead?

33:15.366 --> 33:17.250
You can't get rid of me
that easily, Michael.

33:17.334 --> 33:19.369
Michael!

33:19.420 --> 33:21.904
You're holding on
to something.

33:21.955 --> 33:23.589
What is it?

33:23.674 --> 33:26.426
It's just me.
It's--it's...

33:26.510 --> 33:28.411
It's over.

33:28.462 --> 33:29.712
I don't--
tell him.

33:29.763 --> 33:31.964
Go on, tell him
what you care about the most.

33:32.049 --> 33:33.716
It sure as hell
ain't your family!

33:33.767 --> 33:35.768
You never gave a damn
about me

33:35.853 --> 33:37.770
or your mother or Nate.

33:37.855 --> 33:39.355
So what is it, Michael?

33:39.423 --> 33:41.257
Come on, I want to hear you
say it out loud!

33:41.308 --> 33:44.260
I am not doing this.

33:44.311 --> 33:45.895
You're not doing what?

33:45.946 --> 33:48.815
What are you resisting?

33:50.701 --> 33:53.269
You dedicated your entire life
to that agency.

33:53.320 --> 33:55.321
Okay?
That goddamn agency!

33:55.406 --> 33:56.989
And now it is time
to come clean!

33:57.074 --> 33:58.324
No!

34:01.611 --> 34:03.880
You might not like me,
but you will--

34:03.947 --> 34:06.332
hey! You will listen
to your father!

34:08.418 --> 34:10.920
You wanna
play tough with me now?

34:10.971 --> 34:12.455
'Cause I don't mind
pounding the truth out of you.

34:12.505 --> 34:13.589
Ohh!

34:13.639 --> 34:15.842
- You left home for the CIA.
- Uhh!

34:15.926 --> 34:18.177
You lost Fiona
for the CIA.

34:18.262 --> 34:21.397
And you got your own brother
killed for the CIA.

34:21.465 --> 34:23.815
And now you're sure as hell
gonna give them credit for it!

34:23.900 --> 34:24.967
- Stop!
- So tell them, Michael!

34:25.018 --> 34:27.186
You tell him!
Don't do this! Stop!

34:27.271 --> 34:30.022
This all stops
when you start talking.

34:33.409 --> 34:34.409
Uhh!

34:42.119 --> 34:45.004
Ohh.

34:51.043 --> 34:52.210
What did you tell him?

34:52.295 --> 34:53.513
Michael, what did you
tell him?

34:53.597 --> 34:55.264
- What?
- Before you passed out.

34:55.331 --> 34:57.100
Before they threw you in here.
You said something.

34:57.167 --> 34:58.601
What did you tell him?

35:02.339 --> 35:03.306
I don't know.

35:03.357 --> 35:04.807
I don't remember.

35:04.858 --> 35:06.342
Whatever it is, it's bad.

35:06.393 --> 35:07.810
He knows, Michael.

35:07.861 --> 35:09.362
He knows you betrayed us.

35:09.446 --> 35:11.347
He's going to kill you.

35:11.398 --> 35:13.015
We have to go.

35:19.677 --> 35:21.628
We have to keep moving.

35:21.713 --> 35:22.846
It won't be long
before somebody

35:22.914 --> 35:24.515
realizes
that you're missing.

35:24.582 --> 35:26.583
I can't walk.
I can't make it.

35:26.634 --> 35:28.018
You can and you will.

35:30.922 --> 35:32.973
Otherwise, we're both dead.

35:40.315 --> 35:42.432
Why are you risking
your life for me?

35:42.484 --> 35:44.868
Because you risked your life
to get me out of that prison.

35:44.936 --> 35:46.537
I owe you.

35:46.604 --> 35:48.322
And I pay my debts.

35:48.406 --> 35:49.656
Come on.

35:49.741 --> 35:51.792
Come on, Westen, one foot
in front of the other.

36:18.853 --> 36:20.187
Okay, wait a minute.

36:20.271 --> 36:21.188
Hang on,
I got something right there.

36:21.272 --> 36:23.690
Mike and Sonya.

36:26.444 --> 36:27.995
We have to move faster.

36:28.079 --> 36:29.746
Come on.

36:29.814 --> 36:31.165
Now we know
what they're running from.

36:31.249 --> 36:34.618
I count six armed guards
coming in on them.

36:34.669 --> 36:36.319
What are you doing?
What do you think I'm doing?

36:36.371 --> 36:37.337
I'm backing them up.

36:37.422 --> 36:39.039
Sam, we're too far away.

36:39.124 --> 36:41.375
What the hell else
are we supposed to do?

36:41.459 --> 36:43.710
I've made harder shots.

36:50.301 --> 36:52.052
Is that it?

36:52.137 --> 36:53.670
You've got nothing else
to say to your father?

36:53.721 --> 36:55.689
No, sir.

36:55.773 --> 36:56.857
What's that? Speak up.
I can't hear you.

36:56.941 --> 36:58.508
No, sir!

37:13.291 --> 37:15.542
What did you tell him?

37:18.696 --> 37:21.665
I didn't tell him anything.

37:21.716 --> 37:25.702
I never tell him anything.

37:25.753 --> 37:28.472
Michael, come on.
Move your feet!

37:28.539 --> 37:30.474
Let's go.
Come on.

37:30.541 --> 37:32.421
- I'm not leaving.
- What are you talking about?

37:32.427 --> 37:33.788
You need to help me
with the boat--

37:33.845 --> 37:35.012
I have to go back.

37:35.063 --> 37:36.384
You can't go back.
He'll kill you.

37:36.397 --> 37:37.564
Michael, please,
you're not thinking--

37:37.649 --> 37:39.433
Sonya, listen to me.

37:39.517 --> 37:40.567
I'm sorry.

37:40.652 --> 37:41.735
I'm sorry.
Michael.

37:41.819 --> 37:42.986
Michael!

37:43.054 --> 37:45.055
What the hell is he doing?

37:45.106 --> 37:46.657
Looks like he's giving up.
Why would he do that?

37:46.724 --> 37:47.991
Because he doesn't know
that we're here to help him,

37:48.059 --> 37:49.159
that's why.

37:49.227 --> 37:51.061
Stop right there.
On your knees.

37:52.113 --> 37:53.363
Sam, don't.

37:53.414 --> 37:54.531
Fi, let go of my arm.

37:54.582 --> 37:55.832
It's too late.

37:55.900 --> 37:57.284
They've got him.

38:01.956 --> 38:04.074
Don't touch me!

38:05.543 --> 38:07.211
Uhh!

38:08.463 --> 38:09.596
Oh, Michael.

38:12.350 --> 38:15.052
I didn't want
to do this.

38:15.103 --> 38:17.888
You are an impressive
operative.

38:17.939 --> 38:19.606
You lied to me.

38:19.691 --> 38:20.691
You betrayed me.

38:22.593 --> 38:25.112
You won't pull
that trigger.

38:25.196 --> 38:26.146
Why?

38:26.231 --> 38:29.616
Because I'm here.

38:29.701 --> 38:32.769
I have no reason to run.

38:32.820 --> 38:34.371
And I have nothing to hide.

38:34.438 --> 38:36.290
Wish I could believe you.

38:36.374 --> 38:38.775
Oh, you can.

38:38.826 --> 38:40.160
You can question me,

38:40.245 --> 38:43.113
drug me, torture me.

38:43.164 --> 38:44.498
It won't matter.

38:47.451 --> 38:49.803
Because I know who I am.

38:53.975 --> 38:55.892
A man
who has no secrets

38:55.960 --> 38:59.680
can trust himself.

38:59.764 --> 39:02.649
I'm glad you're
that kind of man.

39:02.734 --> 39:04.768
I told you.

39:07.071 --> 39:09.856
This one's a keeper.

39:09.941 --> 39:12.075
Michael...

39:12.143 --> 39:14.194
I'm James.

39:20.585 --> 39:22.169
Welcome to the family.

39:40.389 --> 39:41.689
Hey, so how's Mike doing?

39:41.740 --> 39:43.415
Is he still
sleeping it off?

39:43.416 --> 39:45.200
Madeline's been
taking care of him,

39:45.251 --> 39:46.902
but he's pretty out of it.
He say anything else?

39:46.953 --> 39:48.593
His brain's still scrambled
from the drugs

39:48.672 --> 39:50.205
in his system.

39:50.256 --> 39:51.924
Fi tried talking to him,
he took one look at her...

39:52.008 --> 39:53.926
Started crying.
Couldn't stop.

39:54.010 --> 39:55.044
You find anything?

39:55.095 --> 39:56.462
Kind of.

39:56.546 --> 39:59.715
I went to the house
where Mike was held.

39:59.766 --> 40:02.468
Well, see for yourself.

40:02.552 --> 40:04.419
What am I looking at?

40:04.471 --> 40:06.188
The house is gone.

40:06.255 --> 40:07.723
- Gone?
- What?

40:07.774 --> 40:09.024
They must
have demolished it

40:09.092 --> 40:10.726
the minute they dumped
Mike on the docks.

40:10.777 --> 40:12.695
This James dude leveled
a $10 million mansion

40:12.762 --> 40:13.762
just to cover his tracks?

40:13.813 --> 40:16.565
That's what I think.

40:16.616 --> 40:19.434
What the hell has Michael
gotten himself into?

40:40.674 --> 40:42.474
Hi.

40:44.460 --> 40:47.129
Hi, baby.

40:47.180 --> 40:50.599
Charlie's so excited
his Uncle Mike is staying over.

40:50.650 --> 40:52.234
I couldn't get him
to sleep in his own bed,

40:52.301 --> 40:55.270
so he wanted to stay here
with you until you woke up.

40:58.324 --> 41:00.242
How you feeling?

41:00.309 --> 41:02.945
I've had better days.

41:02.996 --> 41:05.414
I've seen you look rough
before, Michael...

41:05.481 --> 41:08.534
but nothing like this.

41:08.618 --> 41:11.203
What did they do to you?

41:11.287 --> 41:14.206
They tried to get inside
my head.

41:14.290 --> 41:17.259
They wanted me to tell them
everything.

41:17.326 --> 41:19.828
You held out?

41:19.879 --> 41:22.715
Barely.

41:22.799 --> 41:24.433
They gave me drugs.

41:24.500 --> 41:25.718
I saw things.

41:25.802 --> 41:27.720
I remembered moments,

41:27.804 --> 41:29.605
people...

41:35.011 --> 41:36.945
Is that why
you look so lost?

41:40.817 --> 41:42.818
I saw dad.

41:46.372 --> 41:49.691
I can imagine how hard
that must have been.

41:49.743 --> 41:51.243
Seeing him wasn't
the hard part, ma.

41:58.885 --> 42:01.452
It was realizing...

42:01.476 --> 42:03.252
He was the only reason
I survived.
