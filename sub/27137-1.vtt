01:12.073 --> 01:12.906
- This is how

01:12.906 --> 01:15.110
my enchanted story begins.

01:15.110 --> 01:17.200
I live in my Dad's kingdom.

01:17.200 --> 01:19.670
Actually, scratch that.

01:19.670 --> 01:20.970
The shareholders' kingdom.

01:21.850 --> 01:23.410
Well, my stepmother's kingdom,

01:23.410 --> 01:25.120
but it'll soon be the stockholders' so,

01:25.120 --> 01:27.630
might as well call it their property,

01:27.630 --> 01:28.780
which my dad would be mad about

01:28.780 --> 01:32.140
if he found out, but he never did.

01:32.140 --> 01:34.122
He died three years ago.

01:37.220 --> 01:39.160
I wish I was a regular girl,

01:39.160 --> 01:42.783
but as of now, this is my life.

01:48.970 --> 01:51.453
Anyway, I should get
back to my regular tasks.

01:57.432 --> 01:59.497
This is a mess.

02:02.091 --> 02:04.113
- Cinderella, my wine!

02:04.113 --> 02:05.930
I'm Cinderella, by the way.

02:05.930 --> 02:08.389
I think I forgot to mention that.

02:08.389 --> 02:09.880
- Cinderella!

02:09.880 --> 02:11.740
- These are my step-sisters.

02:11.740 --> 02:12.573
- Cinderella!

02:13.673 --> 02:14.940
- They are a charm, as you can see.

02:14.940 --> 02:16.270
What happened, Lexi?

02:16.270 --> 02:18.500
- We can't turn the channel,
we just got our nails done

02:18.500 --> 02:19.730
and our manicurist doesn't want us

02:19.730 --> 02:22.140
to anything that can damage the nails.

02:22.140 --> 02:22.987
- I need water, too.

02:22.987 --> 02:25.090
- Uh, no, it bloats you,

02:25.090 --> 02:28.130
and I'm not taking you to the
mall looking like a balloon.

02:28.130 --> 02:29.150
- Lexi, that's rude.

02:29.150 --> 02:30.610
You don't need to talk to her like that.

02:30.610 --> 02:31.600
- No, she is right.

02:31.600 --> 02:33.100
We're on a new diet, anyway.

02:33.100 --> 02:34.110
- It's called the no-pass.

02:34.110 --> 02:35.820
You don't let anything
pass through your lips

02:35.820 --> 02:38.340
between the hours of 8:00 AM and 4:30 PM,

02:38.340 --> 02:41.020
then a light snack and
go to bed at 9:00 PM.

02:41.020 --> 02:42.610
- I'm down a pound and a half.

02:42.610 --> 02:44.550
- That's because you're not dedicated.

02:44.550 --> 02:45.890
Don't think I didn't see you eating

02:45.890 --> 02:47.960
that chocolate bar behind the pool house.

02:47.960 --> 02:49.620
- You know, you don't need to be so mean

02:49.620 --> 02:51.350
and neither of you need to be dieting.

02:51.350 --> 02:54.023
- We're trying to stay fierce.

02:55.300 --> 02:57.193
Oh, what happened to you?

02:58.180 --> 02:59.660
- I was scrubbing the floors.

02:59.660 --> 03:01.900
- Have you thought about
scrubbing yourself instead?

03:01.900 --> 03:04.120
- How do you manage to do
these things to yourself?

03:04.120 --> 03:05.700
- It's a special talent, I guess.

03:05.700 --> 03:08.150
I mean, have you ever seen
someone that tries so hard

03:08.150 --> 03:10.593
and yet still manages to look so dirty?

03:11.681 --> 03:12.514
Alright.

03:12.514 --> 03:14.040
- Coming through, it's me time, alright.

03:14.040 --> 03:17.100
Here you go and move your feet.

03:17.100 --> 03:18.150
Thank you.

03:18.150 --> 03:19.960
It's me time.

03:19.960 --> 03:20.900
- As always.

03:20.900 --> 03:23.150
- Don't make me take off these cucumbers.

03:23.150 --> 03:24.339
I don't have time for you.

03:29.140 --> 03:31.134
Cinderella, my wine!

03:47.350 --> 03:49.010
- This is disgusting.

03:49.010 --> 03:50.917
- You must make this again.

03:50.917 --> 03:52.760
- But
they don't hold a finger to

03:52.760 --> 03:55.260
Morgan, my stepmother.

03:55.260 --> 03:57.750
I honestly don't know what
my father saw in that woman.

03:57.750 --> 04:01.310
- Girls, I have news.

04:01.310 --> 04:02.480
- Really?

04:02.480 --> 04:03.840
- No, not for you.

04:03.840 --> 04:07.440
Oh goodness dear, you are a disaster.

04:07.440 --> 04:08.900
- I've been cleaning all day.

04:08.900 --> 04:11.220
- The Windsor family will be attending

04:11.220 --> 04:14.280
this year's Perrault Shareholders' Ball.

04:14.280 --> 04:15.113
- Adam Windsor?

04:15.113 --> 04:16.320
- He is so dreamy.

04:16.320 --> 04:17.820
- The very same.

04:17.820 --> 04:18.970
- What does he look like?

04:18.970 --> 04:20.709
- How do I know.

04:20.709 --> 04:22.000
He's very rich.

04:22.000 --> 04:24.330
- He sounds--
- So he RSVPed?

04:24.330 --> 04:25.780
- Oh no, but he's going to.

04:25.780 --> 04:28.710
You know I always have
an ear to the ground.

04:29.543 --> 04:32.790
Cinderella, please clean up this mess.

04:32.790 --> 04:35.934
We don't want this place
looking like a pigsty.

05:05.864 --> 05:07.060
- Hey Cindy.

05:07.060 --> 05:08.600
- Hey Aunt Claudia.

05:08.600 --> 05:10.000
- What are you doing, honey?

05:11.020 --> 05:12.410
- As always.

05:12.410 --> 05:14.130
You know what it's like living here.

05:14.130 --> 05:16.480
- I don't know why you
put up with those women.

05:17.380 --> 05:18.430
- What option do I have?

05:18.430 --> 05:21.130
- Well my home.
My home is always open.

05:21.130 --> 05:23.433
You don't deserve that type of treatment.

05:24.420 --> 05:26.360
Why don't you let me
tell the shareholders?

05:26.360 --> 05:27.713
- No, don't do that.

05:28.760 --> 05:30.280
- Why are you concerned so much

05:30.280 --> 05:33.703
about the company with
everything you're going through?

05:33.703 --> 05:34.536
- Are you coming to the ball?

05:34.536 --> 05:37.774
- Ah, you know that company
stuff gives me the shingles.

05:37.774 --> 05:40.040
There's a reason I left.

05:40.040 --> 05:41.570
- Please come.

05:41.570 --> 05:43.270
- Maybe.
Maybe I'll surprise you.

05:44.170 --> 05:45.580
Okay, I love you.

05:45.580 --> 05:46.413
- Love you too.

05:50.540 --> 05:52.610
I miss my Aunt Claudia.

05:52.610 --> 05:55.390
She's the only family I have left.

05:55.390 --> 05:58.433
The only one that understands me.

06:02.801 --> 06:05.290
I wish you were here.

06:05.290 --> 06:08.212
It feels so lonely without you, Dad.

06:12.350 --> 06:13.253
I miss you, Dad.

06:14.382 --> 06:16.633
Dad.

06:16.633 --> 06:17.550
- Dad.
Dad!

06:20.020 --> 06:20.853
- Yes, dear?

06:21.830 --> 06:22.880
- Aren't we rich?

06:22.880 --> 06:24.580
- Incredibly.

06:24.580 --> 06:27.500
- Then why don't we have a
butler or a kitchen staff?

06:27.500 --> 06:30.210
- And how much of
our money did you earn?

06:30.210 --> 06:31.690
- I don't have a job.

06:31.690 --> 06:34.400
- Well taking care of
this place is our job.

06:34.400 --> 06:36.060
I'm not gonna raise one
of those little rich kids

06:36.060 --> 06:38.240
that doesn't know how to work.

06:38.240 --> 06:39.270
- I can learn about it.

06:39.270 --> 06:40.470
I could read Oliver Twist.

06:40.470 --> 06:42.510
- Oh, that's a great idea.

06:42.510 --> 06:44.360
But in the meantime
you're gonna learn to cook

06:44.360 --> 06:45.910
and you're gonna learn to clean

06:45.910 --> 06:49.260
and you're gonna have to
help take care of this place.

06:49.260 --> 06:51.310
You have to value what you have

06:51.310 --> 06:53.220
and learn to take care of it, okay?

06:53.220 --> 06:56.470
All of this is the heritage of the company

06:56.470 --> 06:59.020
that our family built and we honor

06:59.020 --> 07:02.853
their very hard work by
continuing to work hard.

07:05.430 --> 07:06.643
- Still sucks.

07:06.643 --> 07:09.063
Well, that it does.

07:10.130 --> 07:10.973
That it does.

07:16.020 --> 07:17.160
- So I'm thinking about

07:17.160 --> 07:19.390
putting some pink bows over there.

07:19.390 --> 07:20.970
- I think it'll be nice, honey.

07:20.970 --> 07:22.682
- So I think I'm gonna get chocolate cake.

07:22.682 --> 07:24.033
- Of course.

07:24.033 --> 07:25.633
Chocolate, your favorite.

07:25.633 --> 07:29.863
So I'm sorry but I gotta go,
I gotta do the meeting, okay?

07:29.863 --> 07:31.963
I won't be a minute longer than I have to.

07:33.393 --> 07:34.910
I got you something.

07:34.910 --> 07:36.030
- You did?

07:36.030 --> 07:37.280
- Yeah, it's your birthday.

07:37.280 --> 07:38.600
- What is it?

07:38.600 --> 07:39.433
- You gotta open it.

07:39.433 --> 07:40.883
- Can I shake it?

07:42.650 --> 07:44.483
Oh, it's beautiful, Dad.

07:45.523 --> 07:46.773
Can I put it on?
- Yeah.

07:47.943 --> 07:49.150
Oh, I knew you'd like it.

07:49.150 --> 07:50.903
I know my girl.

07:50.903 --> 07:51.804
- Thank you.

07:51.804 --> 07:54.122
- Oh, there she is.

07:54.122 --> 07:56.373
My pretty girl.

07:56.373 --> 07:57.206
Is she okay?

07:58.730 --> 08:00.394
- Please don't leave me with them.

08:00.394 --> 08:01.950
- Come on now.

08:01.950 --> 08:05.365
Aunt Claudia's here, your
friends will be here any minute.

08:05.365 --> 08:06.573
You'll be fine.

08:06.573 --> 08:08.638
- You know what I mean.

08:09.471 --> 08:12.477
- Look, I won't stay one minute
longer than I have to, okay?

08:12.477 --> 08:13.413
- Okay.

08:13.413 --> 08:14.816
- Okay.
I love you.

08:14.816 --> 08:16.423
You alright?

08:16.423 --> 08:17.840
I'll be right back.

08:40.611 --> 08:43.559
- He said he was coming back.

08:43.559 --> 08:45.810
- I can tell you he
wanted to, I promise you.

08:47.772 --> 08:49.022
- What do I do?

08:49.966 --> 08:51.663
What do I do?

08:51.663 --> 08:55.297
- We'll figure it out together, okay?

08:55.297 --> 08:57.947
We'll figure it out together.
- Did he leave a will?

08:59.320 --> 09:01.270
- Can we talk about that later, Morgan?

09:18.794 --> 09:21.005
- I'm doing this for you, Dad.

09:42.690 --> 09:44.250
There's not that much science in keeping

09:44.250 --> 09:47.840
a house clean and
organized, especially when

09:47.840 --> 09:52.780
you do it every day of your life.

09:52.780 --> 09:56.020
It's an art my stepsisters
will never understand,

09:56.020 --> 09:57.653
due to their mother's enabling.

09:58.540 --> 10:01.300
Sure, it might take some time.

10:01.300 --> 10:05.070
Okay, fine, a lot of time.

10:05.070 --> 10:07.090
My father always told me that keeping busy

10:07.090 --> 10:08.470
was the best medicine.

10:08.470 --> 10:11.770
He always wanted me to face
my challenges head-first.

10:11.770 --> 10:13.260
I like to think that maybe one day

10:13.260 --> 10:14.823
this will amount to something.

10:15.770 --> 10:19.084
Maybe even owning my own house.

10:24.060 --> 10:26.170
Sometimes the cleaning keeps my mind

10:26.170 --> 10:28.433
off of what's going on around me.

10:33.090 --> 10:36.763
The faster I finish, the faster
I'll have time to myself.

10:39.070 --> 10:41.120
Or at least, that's what I like to think.

10:43.870 --> 10:48.340
With its own beautiful garden, tall trees,

10:48.340 --> 10:51.993
room for horses, away from my step family.

10:56.830 --> 10:59.403
Away from all things bad.

11:00.500 --> 11:01.933
A place for happiness.

11:08.660 --> 11:09.910
A place for me.

11:20.620 --> 11:21.677
- Hello.

11:23.300 --> 11:24.423
Hello.

11:27.160 --> 11:28.023
Anybody home?

11:57.150 --> 11:59.193
- Oh, hi, uh...

12:00.790 --> 12:02.790
Right, good I was just, uh...

12:02.790 --> 12:05.970
And then the thing fell one
me and then I was like...

12:05.970 --> 12:08.520
- Yeah, it happens all the time.

12:08.520 --> 12:10.550
- Right, well.

12:10.550 --> 12:15.450
Anyway, I have the RSVP
for Rex Windsor and family.

12:15.450 --> 12:19.510
- Ah, you know they have
mail that they actually just

12:19.510 --> 12:21.140
bring letters right here to my door.

12:21.140 --> 12:22.570
- Mail, mail.

12:22.570 --> 12:24.533
I think I've heard of such a thing.

12:25.410 --> 12:27.130
- What are you doing here?

12:27.130 --> 12:29.800
- My boss insists that I get
a few pictures of the place.

12:29.800 --> 12:31.533
- Oh, why?

12:32.410 --> 12:34.470
Oh, because he owns the place, doesn't he?

12:34.470 --> 12:36.160
- Yeah, kind of.

12:36.160 --> 12:38.490
It isn't official yet, right?

12:38.490 --> 12:39.910
- I mean he is buying the company,

12:39.910 --> 12:42.080
so he's going to own everything.

12:42.080 --> 12:44.420
- He has me take lots of pictures.

12:44.420 --> 12:46.760
It doesn't mean anything, he just likes

12:46.760 --> 12:48.590
getting me out of the office.

12:48.590 --> 12:50.250
- Well good.

12:50.250 --> 12:51.083
Enjoy.

12:55.410 --> 12:57.750
- Oh, hello.

12:57.750 --> 13:00.880
You're the Windsor family's
emissary, are you not?

13:00.880 --> 13:01.713
- Yes.

13:01.713 --> 13:06.045
Paul, Paul messenger.
- What an unexpected delight.

13:07.220 --> 13:09.780
You have to see what
I've done to the place,

13:09.780 --> 13:11.460
especially the window treatments.

13:11.460 --> 13:12.810
Let me show you around.

13:12.810 --> 13:13.900
- Okay.

13:13.900 --> 13:14.733
It's quite lovely.

13:14.733 --> 13:16.870
- So is there any reason
why the Windsor family

13:16.870 --> 13:18.880
will be attending this year's ball?

13:18.880 --> 13:20.210
- Ah, you've heard the rumor.

13:20.210 --> 13:21.660
- Well, a little birdie may have told me

13:21.660 --> 13:25.210
that Rex is looking for a
suitable lady for his son.

13:25.210 --> 13:27.370
- Yes, Rex is always on the lookout

13:27.370 --> 13:29.550
for acceptable young ladies for Adam.

13:29.550 --> 13:32.020
- Well, let me tell you you won't find

13:32.020 --> 13:34.850
a more acceptable girl than
the ones living in this house.

13:34.850 --> 13:36.830
- Yes, the girl I met at the front door,

13:36.830 --> 13:38.400
she seemed like an excellent young lady.

13:38.400 --> 13:39.500
- Cinderella?

13:39.500 --> 13:40.800
No, not her.

13:40.800 --> 13:42.350
That's not Adam's type.

13:42.350 --> 13:44.810
Now, maybe if Adam's name was Amy

13:44.810 --> 13:47.730
then maybe he'd have a shot, but no.

13:47.730 --> 13:50.040
I was talking about my two daughters.

13:50.040 --> 13:54.493
They are of the highest
class and sophistication.

13:56.260 --> 13:58.350
- Didn't I teach you better than this?

13:58.350 --> 14:00.660
I told the messenger that you girls were

14:00.660 --> 14:03.530
the most acceptable girls
for the young prince.

14:03.530 --> 14:05.768
- Is that supposed to be a compliment?

14:05.768 --> 14:07.070
Is she speaking?

14:07.070 --> 14:08.950
Why is she speaking?

14:08.950 --> 14:10.870
- I didn't hear anything.

14:10.870 --> 14:11.720
- I don't
know, it just doesn't sound

14:11.720 --> 14:13.090
like a great compliment to me.

14:13.090 --> 14:17.040
- Rex is looking for a beautiful,
charming, and elegant girl

14:17.040 --> 14:22.040
for his son, so yes,
acceptable is a compliment.

14:22.440 --> 14:23.670
- I mean, if he likes smiling,

14:23.670 --> 14:25.273
waving, and taking a backseat.

14:26.130 --> 14:28.843
- And being rich and powerful.

14:29.850 --> 14:30.930
- Did you
notice that the messenger

14:30.930 --> 14:32.880
was taking pictures of the house today?

14:33.800 --> 14:35.030
- Of course, dear.

14:35.030 --> 14:38.030
You didn't think he would let
us live here forever, did you?

14:38.960 --> 14:40.253
- I guess not.

14:41.720 --> 14:42.820
- What is that?

14:42.820 --> 14:44.252
- Uh, it's meatloaf.

14:45.085 --> 14:48.530
- Excuse me, I told you we're
on the Janoski diet, right?

14:48.530 --> 14:49.363
- Oh, that's right.

14:49.363 --> 14:51.810
You did send me a link,
but I didn't read it all.

14:51.810 --> 14:53.360
- It's so simple.

14:53.360 --> 14:55.270
We don't eat anything with a chin.

14:55.270 --> 14:58.240
Chin molecules of the meat
go right to your chin.

14:58.240 --> 14:59.720
We need to make sure that we're ready

14:59.720 --> 15:01.499
for selfies with the ball coming.

15:04.000 --> 15:05.050
- What are you doing?

15:08.240 --> 15:09.073
- Nothing.

15:11.270 --> 15:13.460
Who put this on my plate?

15:13.460 --> 15:15.500
- Cinderella needs to
make us a new dinner.

15:15.500 --> 15:17.550
- I spent hours cooking this.

15:17.550 --> 15:19.300
- The food is all over the tray.

15:19.300 --> 15:21.798
The chin molecules will
be all over the food.

15:22.631 --> 15:26.720
- Cinderella, why are
you arguing with science?

15:26.720 --> 15:28.573
Take the food away!

15:30.930 --> 15:32.163
- Science.

15:33.440 --> 15:35.410
- Do you have a problem with science?

15:35.410 --> 15:36.870
- You know I don't know
how to answer that.

15:36.870 --> 15:39.048
None of these fad diets are science.

15:39.881 --> 15:41.330
- Go clean the kitchen up.

15:41.330 --> 15:44.980
We're going out tonight and the
kitchen needs to be shining.

15:44.980 --> 15:47.600
And please, don't let this happen again.

15:47.600 --> 15:48.930
- Yes ma'am.

15:48.930 --> 15:51.280
- Girls, where do you want to go eat?

15:51.280 --> 15:53.150
- Let's head to the steakhouse.

15:53.150 --> 15:55.523
- Mm, I could really go for a steak.

15:56.485 --> 15:57.860
- Steak it is.

15:57.860 --> 15:59.073
Let's go.

16:24.280 --> 16:25.680
- What did I ever do to you?

16:40.157 --> 16:44.379
♪ Oh, little princess ♪

16:44.379 --> 16:48.348
♪ Don't lose the girl ♪

16:48.348 --> 16:51.648
♪ And there inside you ♪

16:51.648 --> 16:56.648
♪ She'll get lost in the world ♪

16:57.128 --> 17:01.208
♪ Don't fall like the rest ♪

17:01.208 --> 17:04.537
♪ This world's just a test ♪

17:04.537 --> 17:08.127
♪ If your drop your crown one day ♪

17:08.127 --> 17:11.877
♪ Pick it up and go your way ♪

17:42.670 --> 17:47.670
- It doesn't matter how you
fix it, as long as you fix it.

17:53.060 --> 17:55.593
- I need you to
do this before the party.

17:56.480 --> 17:58.710
- Oh, actually I was
gonna go get a new outfit.

17:58.710 --> 17:59.910
- Why?

17:59.910 --> 18:02.851
- Well I haven't bought
any clothes since, well...

18:03.684 --> 18:06.470
- Aren't you high maintenance?

18:06.470 --> 18:07.700
Well, if you get the list done

18:07.700 --> 18:08.900
I guess you can get an outfit.

18:08.900 --> 18:11.810
I mean, I don't see
why you would need one.

18:11.810 --> 18:12.960
- There you are, Mother.

18:12.960 --> 18:15.040
You have to see what we bought today.

18:15.040 --> 18:16.390
- We're gonna look fierce.

18:16.390 --> 18:17.680
- Of course, you're my girls.

18:17.680 --> 18:20.510
- Polish the utensils, wax the floor.

18:20.510 --> 18:23.110
I mean do you we even own an aquarium?

18:23.110 --> 18:25.140
- If we don't put it on the list.

18:25.140 --> 18:26.660
- Please stop wining, Cinderella.

18:26.660 --> 18:28.826
We have to show Mother our haul.

18:30.510 --> 18:31.423
- Shall we.

18:36.450 --> 18:38.350
- I sent you the details of our new diet,

18:38.350 --> 18:39.720
the soylent green diet.

18:39.720 --> 18:41.280
Only foods that are made with soy,

18:41.280 --> 18:42.880
lentils, or are the color green.

18:47.468 --> 18:48.918
Got it.

18:58.290 --> 18:59.710
I can do this.

18:59.710 --> 19:01.100
I'm going to that ball.

19:01.100 --> 19:02.690
- What is this?

19:02.690 --> 19:04.040
This is actually cute.

19:04.040 --> 19:04.873
- I know.

19:04.873 --> 19:05.910
It looks so good on me, too.

19:05.910 --> 19:06.743
- No way, hold on.

19:06.743 --> 19:08.300
Mine's gonna look better on me.

19:08.300 --> 19:11.260
- Cinderella's not going to that ball.

19:11.260 --> 19:12.870
- What?

19:12.870 --> 19:16.440
- Cinderella is not going to that ball.

19:16.440 --> 19:18.400
- Why not?

19:18.400 --> 19:21.000
- This is a very important moment for us.

19:21.000 --> 19:23.350
If Cinderella goes she's just gonna

19:23.350 --> 19:25.850
distract us from our moment.

19:25.850 --> 19:27.720
- Cinderella's not
going to distract anyone

19:27.720 --> 19:28.710
while I'm in the room.

19:28.710 --> 19:30.400
- Cinderella is very pretty.

19:30.400 --> 19:31.310
- What?

19:31.310 --> 19:32.450
Whose side are you on?

19:32.450 --> 19:36.090
- Girls, we're all on the same side.

19:36.090 --> 19:38.490
It's not about beauty.

19:38.490 --> 19:42.110
It's known that she is
the heir of her father.

19:42.110 --> 19:46.460
If Cinderella goes everyone's
gonna wanna talk to her.

19:46.460 --> 19:47.293
- They can't.

19:47.293 --> 19:48.230
- But they will!

19:48.230 --> 19:50.240
- I won't stand for it.

19:50.240 --> 19:54.587
- Oh Lexi darling, I know
you won't stand for it.

19:54.587 --> 19:55.883
But you know what?

19:59.949 --> 20:02.510
My darlings.

20:02.510 --> 20:05.240
We won't stand for it.

20:05.240 --> 20:07.860
It doesn't matter what Cinderella wants.

20:07.860 --> 20:10.623
She's not going to that ball.

21:03.740 --> 21:04.676
- What are you doing?

21:04.676 --> 21:05.509
That's mine.

21:05.509 --> 21:06.396
- I like this one too.
- Get, get.

21:06.396 --> 21:07.735
That's my.
You're gonna pay.

21:07.735 --> 21:08.568
Get, get.

21:08.568 --> 21:09.401
- Alright, then give me mine back.

21:09.401 --> 21:11.151
- I'm the oldest one.

21:51.645 --> 21:52.478
You need what?
- I need water.

21:52.478 --> 21:53.311
- You need what?

21:53.311 --> 21:54.944
What do you need?
What do you need?

22:13.680 --> 22:14.680
- Are you finished?

22:14.680 --> 22:16.370
- Almost.
Your tea is ready.

22:16.370 --> 22:17.203
- I see.

22:17.203 --> 22:20.410
- I have dinner going,
soylent green approved.

22:20.410 --> 22:23.083
- Well, I see you have everything in hand.

22:24.793 --> 22:28.470
I can't believe how fast you've
gotten through that list.

22:28.470 --> 22:31.150
You see what a positive
attitude can bring you?

22:31.150 --> 22:33.420
Now everything's ready for the ball.

22:33.420 --> 22:34.840
- The ball.

22:34.840 --> 22:37.050
- It can be tedious.

22:37.050 --> 22:39.230
- Yeah, I used to think that, but

22:39.230 --> 22:41.370
I feel like I owe this to my father.

22:41.370 --> 22:43.060
It makes me feel closer
to him somehow, you know?

22:43.060 --> 22:45.960
- Mm-hm, it's just a party.

22:45.960 --> 22:47.744
- Not to me.

22:47.744 --> 22:48.911
- Hm.

22:49.890 --> 22:52.040
- It's the shareholders' ball.

22:52.040 --> 22:54.540
My father says it was an
opportunity for everybody

22:54.540 --> 22:56.140
and to be a part of the kingdom.

22:57.340 --> 22:59.130
I feel like it's my responsibility

22:59.130 --> 23:02.083
as a Perrault to be there and
to make it happen, you know?

23:03.300 --> 23:04.930
- Isn't that terrific.

23:04.930 --> 23:05.893
- It is terrific.

23:06.990 --> 23:08.640
I have a good feeling about thi--

23:10.360 --> 23:11.773
And I'm talking to myself.

23:13.799 --> 23:16.180
Not the first time, or the last.

23:16.180 --> 23:17.730
I kinda like talking to myself.

23:19.040 --> 23:21.173
Okay, I should stop.
This is getting weird.

23:58.359 --> 24:00.610
Hey, Aunt Claudia.

24:00.610 --> 24:02.773
- Hey.
What are you doing?

24:04.428 --> 24:06.080
- I'm alright.

24:06.080 --> 24:06.913
Not too bad.

24:08.040 --> 24:08.873
- What's wrong?

24:10.170 --> 24:11.287
- Nothing.

24:11.287 --> 24:13.087
I just spent the whole day cleaning.

24:15.210 --> 24:16.700
- Didn't Morgan help you?

24:16.700 --> 24:19.320
- She was busy buying clothes for herself.

24:19.320 --> 24:21.130
- And her daughters?

24:21.130 --> 24:23.503
- Buying even
more clothes for themselves.

24:24.700 --> 24:25.713
- I understand.

24:26.900 --> 24:28.293
- Are you coming to the ball?

24:29.460 --> 24:32.079
- I still haven't finished
the deal in London.

24:32.079 --> 24:33.729
I miss you.

24:34.750 --> 24:36.360
- I miss you too.

24:36.360 --> 24:38.368
But you're going to the ball.

24:38.368 --> 24:39.690
- I don't know.

24:39.690 --> 24:41.640
If I don't finish my chores I can't go.

24:43.150 --> 24:44.110
- Why not?

24:44.110 --> 24:45.020
- Morgan.

24:45.020 --> 24:47.270
She gave me a list of chores.

24:47.270 --> 24:48.890
I'm done with most of them.

24:48.890 --> 24:50.603
I still have the appetizers.

24:51.497 --> 24:53.453
She's going too far.

24:55.870 --> 24:58.150
Rest up, okay?

24:58.150 --> 25:01.950
You and I have a busy day
tomorrow and I'll see you soon.

25:01.950 --> 25:03.180
- Goodnight, Aunt Claudia.

25:03.180 --> 25:04.230
- Goodnight, my love.

25:22.095 --> 25:24.012
- Tomorrow's a big day.

26:38.490 --> 26:40.810
- Father, what exactly are we doing here?

26:40.810 --> 26:43.200
- We are checking the place out.

26:43.200 --> 26:44.563
We own it now.

26:45.720 --> 26:47.530
- And you'd agree that
this has nothing to do

26:47.530 --> 26:49.200
with this fascination of yours to get me

26:49.200 --> 26:50.877
to marry one of the Perrault girls, right?

26:50.877 --> 26:54.690
- It was a suggestion.
I make them all the time.

26:54.690 --> 26:58.903
You don't have to do
anything, just meet the girls.

27:00.020 --> 27:03.990
Marrying one of them could
make the transition easier

27:03.990 --> 27:07.680
for some of the stockholders
of this backwards company.

27:07.680 --> 27:10.640
- Am I not going to meet them all tonight?

27:10.640 --> 27:11.473
- This...

27:11.473 --> 27:12.570
- Pardon?

27:12.570 --> 27:15.440
- It's not just a party; it's a ball.

27:15.440 --> 27:20.080
Puffy dresses, masks,
the whole nine yards.

27:20.080 --> 27:22.530
I thought it would be
easier to talk to them now.

27:25.340 --> 27:26.540
- There's always a time.

27:27.950 --> 27:29.750
- Do you have anything better to do?

27:31.920 --> 27:33.220
That's what I thought.

28:06.615 --> 28:07.915
- Oh my God!

28:07.915 --> 28:09.515
I'm frickin' late!

28:09.515 --> 28:11.085
I'm late, I'm late, I'm late, I'm late,

28:11.085 --> 28:13.277
I'm late, I'm late, I'm late.

28:22.260 --> 28:24.974
- Hello, I didn't
know you were coming.

28:24.974 --> 28:26.810
- We thought we'd get a look at the place.

28:26.810 --> 28:28.670
- Well please, come in.

28:28.670 --> 28:30.100
It's yours after all, Rex.

28:30.100 --> 28:31.840
- Well I guess you're right.
- Ohh.

28:31.840 --> 28:35.444
- Of course, we also wanted
to meet your lovely family.

28:35.444 --> 28:36.298
- I'm late!

28:36.298 --> 28:37.404
Oh my God, I'm late.

28:37.404 --> 28:38.320
I'm frickin' late.

28:38.320 --> 28:39.650
- And that was...

28:39.650 --> 28:42.150
- Cinderella, she's having
one of her better days.

28:42.150 --> 28:44.874
You know, when she's not being violent.

28:44.874 --> 28:47.380
- I was told she was sweet.

28:47.380 --> 28:50.480
- She could be, but you know
the doctors say deranged.

28:50.480 --> 28:51.630
Let me show you around.

29:12.680 --> 29:16.501
- Just get half a flower bouquet

29:16.501 --> 29:18.190
and put out the decorations.

29:18.190 --> 29:20.670
I think I'll have time to get a dress.

29:20.670 --> 29:23.950
- Oh, Adam smiled at me.

29:23.950 --> 29:25.560
- He looked at me and smiled.

29:25.560 --> 29:28.210
- Are you implying that
I got a residual smile?

29:28.210 --> 29:29.890
- He looked at me and smiled at me first.

29:29.890 --> 29:31.791
Your smile was just a leftover smile.

29:31.791 --> 29:32.797
- Mercedes, can you pass me the--

29:32.797 --> 29:34.230
- The what?

29:34.230 --> 29:36.360
- We're trying to
get ready for the ball.

29:36.360 --> 29:37.193
- Yeah.

29:37.193 --> 29:39.003
We have a lot to do before the ball.

29:41.050 --> 29:42.560
- Why are you wearing that?

29:42.560 --> 29:43.600
- Why?

29:43.600 --> 29:45.420
- That's the hair clip my father got me

29:45.420 --> 29:46.253
- Hm?

29:46.253 --> 29:47.800
- Lexi, maybe
you should give it back.

29:47.800 --> 29:48.970
- No, I like it.

29:48.970 --> 29:50.010
- It's not yours!

29:50.010 --> 29:52.470
- Well you're gonna have to catch me.

29:52.470 --> 29:53.303
- Give it back!

29:53.303 --> 29:54.136
- I don't want to.

29:54.136 --> 29:55.210
You can't make me.

29:55.210 --> 29:56.043
- Give it back!

29:56.043 --> 29:57.267
- You have some cleaning to do, don't you?

29:57.267 --> 29:58.960
- You are
a terrible human being.

29:58.960 --> 29:59.827
Just give it back.
- You're such a crybaby.

29:59.827 --> 30:02.033
- You're so mean!
- Get away from me.

30:02.033 --> 30:04.260
- What is going on here?

30:04.260 --> 30:06.120
- She's wearing my hair clip.

30:06.120 --> 30:08.190
- It goes with my outfit for the ball.

30:08.190 --> 30:11.300
- Girls, in this family we share.

30:11.300 --> 30:12.780
- It's from her father.

30:12.780 --> 30:15.380
- I was going
to wear it to the ball.

30:15.380 --> 30:18.163
- Oh dear, you're
not going to the ball.

30:19.210 --> 30:20.043
- What?

30:20.930 --> 30:23.173
- There's too much of a mess around here.

30:24.330 --> 30:27.380
- I have been cleaning all day.

30:27.380 --> 30:30.260
Everything in this house is clean.

30:30.260 --> 30:32.760
- Well then I'll just
have to find something.

30:32.760 --> 30:34.450
- I have been working hard for days.

30:34.450 --> 30:36.040
You haven't asked your
daughters to lift a finger.

30:36.040 --> 30:37.390
They do nothing around here.

30:37.390 --> 30:39.320
- Oh, we did 40 minutes of Pilates class.

30:39.320 --> 30:40.770
I wouldn't call that nothing.

30:45.670 --> 30:46.503
- Aha!

30:51.880 --> 30:53.990
- Why would you do that?

30:53.990 --> 30:56.140
- The guests will be here in two hours.

30:56.140 --> 30:59.353
Clean up all these lentils and
then you can go to the party.

31:14.410 --> 31:15.910
- Aww, sis.

31:27.109 --> 31:28.609
- This isn't fair.

31:49.395 --> 31:52.645
I would be proud to serve this to Lexi.

32:47.760 --> 32:49.867
We're a family who shares, right?

33:02.700 --> 33:04.373
How are there no nice dresses?

33:07.510 --> 33:08.860
- Because I took them out.

33:08.860 --> 33:10.900
- I cleaned up all the lentils.

33:10.900 --> 33:14.060
- I don't care.
You're not going to the ball.

33:14.060 --> 33:17.020
- I have done everything
you've asked of me, Morgan.

33:17.020 --> 33:19.530
- My girls need to shine

33:19.530 --> 33:21.890
and you're just a distraction to them.

33:21.890 --> 33:22.723
- Well this party's

33:22.723 --> 33:24.160
happening in this house, isn't it?

33:24.160 --> 33:26.323
- In this house, but not in this room!

33:27.340 --> 33:28.590
- Open the door!

33:28.590 --> 33:30.730
- I'll let you out tomorrow.

33:30.730 --> 33:32.183
- Don't you think the
guests are going to complain

33:32.183 --> 33:33.433
when they hear me banging on the walls?

33:33.433 --> 33:34.870
- Pound all you want.

33:34.870 --> 33:36.973
With the music loud nobody'll hear.

33:36.973 --> 33:38.780
Stop crying like a baby.

33:38.780 --> 33:40.303
You're just like your father.

34:15.139 --> 34:18.072
Why is this happening to me?

34:18.072 --> 34:19.803
Why are they treating me this way?

34:59.687 --> 35:03.437
- Welcome to the Perrault
Shareholders' Ball.

35:04.580 --> 35:06.670
Oh, hm.
It's you.

35:06.670 --> 35:08.310
- You're always so welcoming, Morgan.

35:08.310 --> 35:10.850
- Oh you're always welcome, Aunt Claudia.

35:10.850 --> 35:13.850
After all, we are sisters by marriage.

35:13.850 --> 35:15.440
- You disgust me.

35:15.440 --> 35:17.410
- Mhmm.
Can I get your ticket?

35:17.410 --> 35:19.000
- You know I
wasn't invited to the ball.

35:19.000 --> 35:21.630
- Oh, I am so shocked.

35:21.630 --> 35:24.080
We're gonna have to get that rectified.

35:24.080 --> 35:26.740
Oh wait, we already sent
out the invitations,

35:26.740 --> 35:27.750
so we're gonna have to rectify

35:27.750 --> 35:29.600
that for the next year's ball.

35:29.600 --> 35:33.310
- Well sister, I cannot thank
you enough for your kindness

35:33.310 --> 35:34.870
and I cannot wait for next year,

35:34.870 --> 35:36.610
but in the meantime where is my niece?

35:36.610 --> 35:39.850
- She went out to get stuff for the party!

35:41.010 --> 35:45.320
Oh gentlemen, hello.

35:45.320 --> 35:46.780
Guess who I am?

35:46.780 --> 35:49.910
- Some mysterious enchantress?

35:49.910 --> 35:53.430
- Oh you're so special.

35:53.430 --> 35:54.570
It's me, Morgan.

35:54.570 --> 35:57.480
- Oh, I never would have guessed.

35:58.490 --> 36:00.850
- Please, come join the party.

36:00.850 --> 36:01.750
- Thank you.

36:02.660 --> 36:05.227
Oh, what lovely decor.

36:05.227 --> 36:06.060
Beautiful.

36:06.060 --> 36:08.603
- Oh, let me go get my daughters.

36:12.850 --> 36:17.400
- This is very important for
the future of our company.

36:17.400 --> 36:19.490
- Dad, this is your company.

36:19.490 --> 36:20.520
It's only our company when

36:20.520 --> 36:21.830
you need me to do something for you.

36:21.830 --> 36:24.280
- The company that pays for
everything you've ever worn,

36:24.280 --> 36:27.250
eaten, driven, played with or slept on.

36:27.250 --> 36:28.370
I need you to--
- Alright.

36:28.370 --> 36:29.340
I got it, Dad.

36:31.310 --> 36:33.720
- I'm not asking you to
marry one of them tonight.

36:33.720 --> 36:35.620
I'm just saying if you could make it seem

36:35.620 --> 36:38.383
like things were headed in that direction.

36:39.224 --> 36:41.083
- Rex, Adam.

36:43.155 --> 36:47.880
- Oh God, this woman again.

36:47.880 --> 36:49.130
Brace yourself.

37:04.994 --> 37:05.827
- Cindy?

37:07.293 --> 37:09.162
- Aunt Claudia.

37:09.162 --> 37:09.995
- Cindy, is that you?

37:09.995 --> 37:11.643
- Yeah.
Weren't you in London?

37:12.560 --> 37:14.360
- No, no, I finished that.

37:14.360 --> 37:16.010
But what are you doing in there?

37:16.010 --> 37:18.070
- It's not use.
Morgan locked it.

37:18.070 --> 37:19.433
She has the key.

37:20.390 --> 37:22.563
- No worries, I have an idea.

37:23.480 --> 37:25.713
I need you to walk over to Lexi's closet.

37:27.710 --> 37:28.543
- Yeah.

37:28.543 --> 37:31.010
- Okay, walk over there now.

37:31.010 --> 37:31.843
- Why?

37:31.843 --> 37:33.130
- Just trust me, do it.

37:33.130 --> 37:34.130
- Okay.

37:36.520 --> 37:38.333
- Let me know
when you get there.

37:41.330 --> 37:42.250
Are you there?

37:42.250 --> 37:43.700
- Yeah, I'm here.

37:43.700 --> 37:45.050
- Okay.

37:45.050 --> 37:45.883
Close the door.

37:50.520 --> 37:51.470
Look to your right.

37:52.960 --> 37:53.793
Look on the bottom.

37:53.793 --> 37:56.850
You see the first draw on
the bottom on the right?

37:56.850 --> 37:58.270
- Yeah.
- Okay.

37:58.270 --> 37:59.460
I need you to pull that.

37:59.460 --> 38:01.043
I need you to yank it all out.

39:00.302 --> 39:02.102
Your Dad kept that all for you.

39:02.102 --> 39:05.922
- Aunt Claudia!

39:05.922 --> 39:07.000
How did you get in here?

39:07.000 --> 39:08.550
- There's a door in the garden.

39:10.030 --> 39:11.430
- Everything is so beautiful.

39:11.430 --> 39:15.147
- It is, but there's one
more thing that's beautiful.

39:17.544 --> 39:19.794
- What's this?

39:22.588 --> 39:24.921
- This belonged to your mom.

39:48.955 --> 39:50.122
Go, try it on.

40:25.470 --> 40:28.000
You look like your mom.

40:28.000 --> 40:28.833
Beautiful.

40:29.917 --> 40:32.787
But hold on, we're missing one thing.

40:34.256 --> 40:35.923
And this is for you.

40:43.107 --> 40:43.940
Go on.

41:05.574 --> 41:06.824
Let me see you.

41:07.730 --> 41:08.597
Stunning.

41:08.597 --> 41:10.230
You look stunning.

41:10.230 --> 41:12.270
Oh look, you're missing one more thing.

41:12.270 --> 41:13.320
Go get your earrings.

41:24.210 --> 41:25.580
Come on, let's go.

41:25.580 --> 41:26.536
You gotta go.

41:26.536 --> 41:27.803
I can't wait 'til Morgan sees you.

41:27.803 --> 41:30.910
- No, I don't want her to see me.

41:30.910 --> 41:31.743
- But why?

41:32.690 --> 41:35.563
- I just want this moment for my father.

41:37.380 --> 41:38.213
- Okay.

41:39.580 --> 41:42.110
Fair enough, let's do this.

41:46.610 --> 41:48.463
- What are you doing?

41:49.552 --> 41:51.270
Dad, I tried.

41:51.270 --> 41:52.770
I tried.

41:52.770 --> 41:53.963
- What does that mean?

41:59.170 --> 42:00.951
- They're psychos, Dad.

42:00.951 --> 42:03.563
And then their mom is just evil.

42:04.920 --> 42:06.610
Did you know that the ugly one could

42:06.610 --> 42:08.310
stick her whole foot in her mouth?

42:09.610 --> 42:11.830
- She's not that ugly.

42:11.830 --> 42:13.940
Let people see you together.

42:13.940 --> 42:16.470
The rumor mill will do the rest.

42:16.470 --> 42:18.643
Just talk to them a bit more.

42:19.930 --> 42:21.961
- Dad, I can't, just please, I'll do--

42:23.100 --> 42:25.973
- Do it.
Don't make a scene.

42:28.350 --> 42:30.140
- One night.
- That's it.

42:33.188 --> 42:34.021
- Fine.

42:39.221 --> 42:40.221
- One night.

44:33.337 --> 44:34.555
- Oh my God!

44:44.777 --> 44:46.860
- Oh, so do you work out?

44:47.755 --> 44:48.588
- A little bit.

44:48.588 --> 44:51.330
- Oh, you look like you work out.

44:51.330 --> 44:54.160
- I'm suddenly wishing I did more cardio.

44:54.160 --> 44:56.170
- Sorry about my sister.

44:56.170 --> 44:58.140
She can be very forward.

44:58.140 --> 44:59.760
- What do you mean, forward?

44:59.760 --> 45:01.410
- You grab everyone.
- Everyone?

45:02.400 --> 45:04.582
I'll show you forward.

45:05.970 --> 45:06.930
- You two need to--

45:06.930 --> 45:08.347
- Forward!

45:11.457 --> 45:12.290
- Girls.

45:12.290 --> 45:15.250
I am so sorry about this, Adam.

45:15.250 --> 45:17.900
I will deal with you two later.

45:41.035 --> 45:43.618
Yes!

45:55.070 --> 45:56.670
- Sorry.

45:56.670 --> 45:58.753
- No, it was my fault.

45:59.750 --> 46:01.060
- No, really, I should have been

46:01.060 --> 46:04.089
watching where I was going, but I got...

46:06.060 --> 46:08.082
- I was gonna say sweet outfit.

46:12.150 --> 46:13.790
- Were you at the party?

46:13.790 --> 46:15.540
I don't think I've seen you before.

46:16.640 --> 46:19.563
- Must have been my Uber
driver's first time in the area.

46:19.563 --> 46:21.563
I got a little bit lost.

46:22.885 --> 46:23.968
- It happens.

46:26.013 --> 46:28.040
- Adam, Rex!

46:28.040 --> 46:30.207
- I gotta get out of here.

46:31.560 --> 46:33.021
- I know the perfect spot.

46:33.021 --> 46:34.104
Come with me.

46:42.021 --> 46:43.381
- You think we're safe here?

46:43.381 --> 46:44.214
- For now.

46:54.750 --> 46:57.143
- It looks like you're trying
to run away from something.

47:01.860 --> 47:03.713
- Aren't we all trying to
run away from something?

47:07.850 --> 47:09.500
- What are you running away from?

47:10.580 --> 47:11.443
- Myself.

47:16.310 --> 47:17.143
What about you?

47:20.850 --> 47:21.770
- The company.

47:23.620 --> 47:24.453
My father.

47:26.300 --> 47:27.423
His expectations.

47:29.810 --> 47:33.160
I just wish we could have that
one conversation that didn't

47:33.160 --> 47:35.637
revolve around the company
or my father's assets.

49:36.710 --> 49:38.093
- There you are.

49:40.390 --> 49:42.630
Your father said I should take you home.

49:42.630 --> 49:43.463
Let's go.

49:51.860 --> 49:52.693
Let's go!

49:54.100 --> 49:56.740
You're gonna get me in a lot
of trouble with your father.

49:56.740 --> 49:57.573
- Alright.

50:17.900 --> 50:20.163
- Oh Claudia, I didn't know you were here.

50:21.450 --> 50:23.170
- And what are you guys doing?

50:23.170 --> 50:24.204
- We're looking for Adam.

50:25.037 --> 50:26.530
It was supposed to be a secret?

50:27.700 --> 50:29.320
- Adam.

50:29.320 --> 50:31.563
Oh, yes, Rex's Adam.

50:32.620 --> 50:34.823
I think he went to the kitchen.

50:36.650 --> 50:37.950
- Thank you, Aunt Claudia.

50:53.210 --> 50:56.740
- They take this kingdom
stuff very seriously.

50:56.740 --> 50:58.363
I need you to do the same.

51:00.910 --> 51:02.600
- Oh, you're still here.

51:02.600 --> 51:05.990
- Oh, it's always so
nice to see you, Morgan.

51:05.990 --> 51:07.790
- And when are you leaving?

51:09.530 --> 51:10.990
- He wasn't in the kitchen.

51:10.990 --> 51:13.390
- Nor the dining room,
hallway, or the bathroom.

51:36.616 --> 51:38.860
- Where have you been?

51:38.860 --> 51:40.460
- What are you talking about?

51:40.460 --> 51:41.610
- You know what I mean.

51:43.000 --> 51:43.983
You're gonna see.

51:45.330 --> 51:46.163
Come on, girls.

52:17.700 --> 52:19.400
- Did you enjoy yourself?

52:21.256 --> 52:22.390
- I mean, I got to sleep in a bed

52:22.390 --> 52:24.140
for the first time in months.

52:24.140 --> 52:26.110
- You know what I mean.

52:26.110 --> 52:27.470
- I'm not sure I do.

52:27.470 --> 52:29.900
I've been locked in here all night.

52:29.900 --> 52:31.790
- Let me pretend like I believe that.

52:31.790 --> 52:34.240
On second thought, let me not.

52:34.240 --> 52:36.683
What did you say to Adam?

52:37.860 --> 52:39.870
- I didn't say anything to him.

52:39.870 --> 52:42.320
Oh wait, am I still
pretending I was locked

52:42.320 --> 52:44.940
in this room by my psychotic stepmother?

52:44.940 --> 52:48.500
- I do what needs to be done.

52:48.500 --> 52:51.230
- I've tried to find the
good in you for so long.

52:51.230 --> 52:52.513
I just can't anymore.

52:53.360 --> 52:54.930
- You're breaking my heart.

52:54.930 --> 52:58.663
You know, I really tried
to do my best for you.

53:00.120 --> 53:01.150
- I must have been sick that day.

53:01.150 --> 53:03.970
- You've just been so difficult.

53:03.970 --> 53:05.153
- Well I can't imagine.

53:07.050 --> 53:11.250
- We're closing on the deal
later today at the luncheon.

53:11.250 --> 53:16.120
Then I'll let you out of this
room and my life forever.

53:25.940 --> 53:27.770
- Why do we have to do this?

53:27.770 --> 53:29.498
- Where's Cinderella?

53:33.896 --> 53:35.550
- This is disgusting!

53:35.550 --> 53:37.090
- No, what's wrong?

53:37.090 --> 53:38.680
- Where is Cinderella?

53:38.680 --> 53:40.200
- What is going on here?

53:40.200 --> 53:41.950
This place is a mess.

53:41.950 --> 53:44.350
The kingdom's gonna be
here in less than an hour.

53:44.350 --> 53:46.333
Pick all this up.
Hurry up.

54:40.570 --> 54:42.220
- Adam, you made me move my schedule

54:42.220 --> 54:43.800
today by coming this early.

54:43.800 --> 54:45.560
Your father will be here in any minute

54:45.560 --> 54:48.260
and I still to get everything
ready for the signature.

54:48.260 --> 54:49.660
What's going on?

54:49.660 --> 54:51.820
- I couldn't even sleep last night.

54:51.820 --> 54:53.670
I gotta find this girl from yesterday.

54:53.670 --> 54:54.513
- With one shoe?

54:55.975 --> 54:56.880
- Of course.

54:56.880 --> 54:58.940
- How do you know she'll even be here?

54:58.940 --> 55:00.960
I mean, she ran away last night.

55:00.960 --> 55:02.660
She was likely crashing the party.

55:03.628 --> 55:04.810
A Shareholders' Ball?

55:04.810 --> 55:06.380
Who's gonna crash an event like that.

55:06.380 --> 55:09.380
- Okay, so you're crazy about this girl.

55:09.380 --> 55:12.153
Did you even see her face,
I mean without the mask?

55:14.050 --> 55:15.900
- Well, you interrupted us, remember?

55:19.870 --> 55:21.273
- What option did I have?

55:36.520 --> 55:39.340
- You did come out of this
room and you know what?

55:39.340 --> 55:41.426
I'm gonna find that shoe.

55:41.426 --> 55:42.730
- You want my shoes?

55:42.730 --> 55:44.160
- We have shoes of our own.

55:44.160 --> 55:46.920
- Not the one that Adam's looking for.

55:46.920 --> 55:48.190
- Adam wears heals?

55:48.190 --> 55:49.730
- What? No!

55:49.730 --> 55:52.450
It seems that Cinderella
has enchanted Adam

55:52.450 --> 55:55.060
and all we have to do is find the shoe

55:55.060 --> 55:58.860
and you will be the woman of his dreams.

55:58.860 --> 55:59.821
- I go first!

55:59.821 --> 56:01.587
- No, I'm the oldest.

56:01.587 --> 56:03.220
- And you know what?

56:03.220 --> 56:05.503
You will stay in here forever!

56:22.060 --> 56:24.303
- What are you doing, Adam?

56:25.240 --> 56:27.736
- There's this girl I met last night.

56:29.010 --> 56:31.260
- You're going to stop right now.

56:31.260 --> 56:33.003
We have business to attend to.

56:34.340 --> 56:38.104
- Dad, I have my own
business to attend to.

56:38.104 --> 56:39.240
- What?

56:39.240 --> 56:41.633
I'm trying to secure your future.

56:46.250 --> 56:48.350
- I'm the only one in charge of my future.

56:50.510 --> 56:52.733
- He's never spoken to me in that tone.

57:06.483 --> 57:10.750
- Oh, I've done all this
and nobody's here yet.

57:10.750 --> 57:12.370
- I'm here, Morgan.

57:12.370 --> 57:13.710
- What are you doing here?

57:13.710 --> 57:14.900
- I am a shareholder.

57:14.900 --> 57:17.020
- You bought one stock.

57:17.020 --> 57:18.800
- That entitles me to be here.

57:18.800 --> 57:20.670
- Oh, well terrific.

57:20.670 --> 57:21.870
So glad you're here.

57:21.870 --> 57:24.450
- Oh, I knew you'd say that Morgan.

57:41.180 --> 57:43.453
- Oh Adam, you found my shoe.

57:45.180 --> 57:46.013
- Your shoe?

57:46.013 --> 57:47.079
- It sure is, darling.

57:47.079 --> 57:49.071
Let me show you, let me show you.

57:50.970 --> 57:52.610
I'll show you.
I know you're very excited.

57:52.610 --> 57:55.810
I'm just as excited, darling.
Watch as it fits me.

57:58.804 --> 58:00.109
Give me one second.

58:00.109 --> 58:01.359
Give me one second, darling.

58:01.359 --> 58:04.087
It's gonna fit.
- Hi Adam.

58:04.087 --> 58:06.582
Sissy, I don't think it fits you.

58:17.402 --> 58:19.569
It fits me, I'll show you.

58:28.959 --> 58:29.910
They're on.

58:29.910 --> 58:32.060
- What are you
doing with Cinderella's shoe?

58:32.060 --> 58:33.950
- What?
They are not.

58:33.950 --> 58:34.783
- Who's Cinderella?

58:34.783 --> 58:35.720
- Cinderella's the young girl

58:35.720 --> 58:37.840
who wore those shoes last night.

58:37.840 --> 58:38.673
- Where is she?

58:38.673 --> 58:39.506
- I know where she is.

58:39.506 --> 58:40.339
Grab that, let's go.

58:41.788 --> 58:42.621
- Oh.

58:48.400 --> 58:49.695
- She's in here.

58:52.130 --> 58:52.963
- What now?

58:52.963 --> 58:54.810
Are you gonna kick me out of the house?

58:54.810 --> 58:56.030
- No, it's me.

58:56.030 --> 58:57.170
- Who are you?

58:57.170 --> 58:58.253
- It's Adam.

59:03.620 --> 59:04.913
- Aunt Claudia?

59:10.750 --> 59:12.908
- Step away from the door.

59:26.577 --> 59:27.410
- Ah, come on.

59:27.410 --> 59:28.243
We have to go.

59:28.243 --> 59:29.076
They're about to sign.

59:29.076 --> 59:29.909
Let's go, let's go.

59:35.700 --> 59:38.690
- As the widow of the late Henry Perrault,

59:38.690 --> 59:42.780
Morgan Luscinia Perrault is
going to formally sign over

59:42.780 --> 59:46.750
the company to Rex Windsor
and Windsor Corporation.

59:46.750 --> 59:49.120
Today is the final vote on the matter.

59:49.120 --> 59:51.623
We now open the floor to discussion.

59:53.050 --> 59:56.750
- Oh behalf of my husband,
may he rest in peace.

59:56.750 --> 59:57.770
- Are you proud of the way

59:57.770 --> 59:59.690
that you've treated his daughter?

59:59.690 --> 01:00:01.812
- What is she talking about?

01:00:01.812 --> 01:00:03.860
Teenagers.

01:00:03.860 --> 01:00:06.150
- She's talking about the
fact that you locked her up

01:00:06.150 --> 01:00:08.837
last night and that your
daughters never help her

01:00:08.837 --> 01:00:12.250
and that you have her clean
the house all day long.

01:00:12.250 --> 01:00:13.760
- She was misbehaving.

01:00:13.760 --> 01:00:16.010
Henry would have wanted
me to discipline her.

01:00:17.060 --> 01:00:19.410
- What gives you the
right to lock me away?

01:00:19.410 --> 01:00:23.033
What gives you the right to
sign away my father's company?

01:00:23.033 --> 01:00:23.866
- Well--

01:00:23.866 --> 01:00:24.840
- I have the documents right here.

01:00:24.840 --> 01:00:27.874
The last will and testament
of one Henry Perrault.

01:00:29.810 --> 01:00:30.710
- Let me see that.

01:00:33.740 --> 01:00:36.440
This is not my brother's signature.

01:00:36.440 --> 01:00:37.940
This is fake.

01:00:37.940 --> 01:00:38.773
- What?

01:00:38.773 --> 01:00:40.930
This woman doesn't know
what she's talking about.

01:00:40.930 --> 01:00:45.930
- I know my brother's signature,
Morgan, and this is not it.

01:00:47.700 --> 01:00:51.130
- Even if this is not
Perrault's signature,

01:00:51.130 --> 01:00:54.380
this fine woman is still his widow.

01:00:54.380 --> 01:00:59.380
If there is not will then his
assets should transfer to her.

01:01:29.110 --> 01:01:30.690
- That is not his signature.

01:01:30.690 --> 01:01:31.680
I don't care what she tells you.

01:01:31.680 --> 01:01:33.653
That's not his signature, that's a fake.

01:01:35.040 --> 01:01:36.794
Look at it, that's a fake signature.

01:01:36.794 --> 01:01:37.727
- Okay, I'll assess it.

01:01:37.727 --> 01:01:39.630
- You don't need to assess anything.

01:01:39.630 --> 01:01:40.880
That is a fake signature.

01:01:40.880 --> 01:01:42.330
- Here it is.

01:01:49.520 --> 01:01:51.350
- I'll need a little
while to read through this

01:01:51.350 --> 01:01:53.200
and then we can get back to the vote.

01:01:55.730 --> 01:01:58.400
- I'm sorry if this ruins
things with your father.

01:01:58.400 --> 01:01:59.233
- That's fine.

01:01:59.233 --> 01:02:00.100
Do what you gotta do.

01:02:01.090 --> 01:02:04.490
- So the will is fairly simple.

01:02:04.490 --> 01:02:08.030
Everything passes to
Cinderella when she turns 18.

01:02:08.030 --> 01:02:12.600
- She's only 16.
I'm under control until then.

01:02:12.600 --> 01:02:14.020
- Actually no.

01:02:14.020 --> 01:02:16.650
Henry Perrault wrote
that Claudia Perrault--

01:02:16.650 --> 01:02:17.483
- What?!

01:02:17.483 --> 01:02:18.500
- Should be in charge of the trust

01:02:18.500 --> 01:02:20.698
until Cinderella turns 18.

01:02:20.698 --> 01:02:23.248
- Yes. Yes. Yes.

01:02:23.248 --> 01:02:24.081
- It can't be.

01:02:24.081 --> 01:02:25.157
- Yes it can be, Morgan.

01:02:25.157 --> 01:02:26.573
- I have no more to say.

01:02:27.808 --> 01:02:29.017
- You need to leave.

01:02:29.017 --> 01:02:29.850
- You can't do this to me.

01:02:29.850 --> 01:02:31.470
- Yes I can.
- I live here too.

01:02:31.470 --> 01:02:32.670
- No, you don't.

01:02:32.670 --> 01:02:34.173
Get out.
Get out.

01:02:36.660 --> 01:02:38.678
- Let's go, girls.

01:02:42.067 --> 01:02:42.905
- You did it.

01:02:42.905 --> 01:02:45.583
You did it.
You did it.

01:02:50.720 --> 01:02:51.918
- Come with me.

01:02:51.918 --> 01:02:52.751
- Go.

01:03:04.167 --> 01:03:07.430
- And this tree has
been growing ever since.

01:03:07.430 --> 01:03:08.263
- It's nice.

01:03:08.263 --> 01:03:10.303
- Yeah, I planted these myself.

01:03:11.420 --> 01:03:13.657
Purple ones remind me of my mom.

01:03:23.800 --> 01:03:26.499
- So I guess we won't be
doing business together?

01:03:26.499 --> 01:03:29.040
I don't know about that.

01:03:30.017 --> 01:03:32.400
- You know, my father actually wanted me

01:03:32.400 --> 01:03:34.147
to marry one of the Perrault girls.

01:03:35.950 --> 01:03:37.240
- That's probably out the window.

01:03:37.240 --> 01:03:38.873
He doesn't seem too fond of me.

01:03:42.070 --> 01:03:45.123
- How about I take you out sometime?

01:03:46.358 --> 01:03:48.987
- I could do that.

01:03:48.987 --> 01:03:51.768
- Well, I think--

01:03:59.050 --> 01:04:00.213
Tomorrow night okay?

01:04:01.280 --> 01:04:02.113
- That's fine.

01:04:02.980 --> 01:04:03.813
- I'll see you.

01:04:11.320 --> 01:04:13.503
- Things are gonna be
a little different now.

01:04:36.230 --> 01:04:38.387
- I have to tell you I'm very excited.

01:04:38.387 --> 01:04:41.352
I've been waiting for
this for a very long time.

01:04:41.352 --> 01:04:42.433
Ah, there she is.

01:04:46.660 --> 01:04:48.903
Are we ready to make this merger happen?

01:04:50.170 --> 01:04:51.970
- Definitely, let's do this,

01:04:53.027 --> 01:04:54.699
- Let's do this.

01:05:14.967 --> 01:05:16.780
And I finally understood.

01:05:16.780 --> 01:05:20.253
It had nothing to do with my
stepsisters or my stepmother.

01:05:21.140 --> 01:05:24.003
Only I can stand up for myself.

01:05:28.740 --> 01:05:30.300
- Congratulations, you are now

01:05:30.300 --> 01:05:32.867
the President of Windsor Corporation.

01:05:32.867 --> 01:05:34.019
- Thank you.

01:05:34.019 --> 01:05:36.686
- I think this deserves a toast.

01:05:37.880 --> 01:05:38.713
Yes?

01:05:42.200 --> 01:05:45.323
To my beautiful niece and to my brother.

01:05:46.170 --> 01:05:47.419
Cheers.

01:05:54.838 --> 01:05:57.115
So.

01:05:57.115 --> 01:05:58.390
- If you could please excuse me.

01:05:58.390 --> 01:06:00.051
I think I have something left to do.

01:06:00.051 --> 01:06:00.884
- Okay.

01:06:04.940 --> 01:06:06.445
- Hurry up ladies.

01:06:10.456 --> 01:06:11.289
- Hey ladies.

01:06:13.740 --> 01:06:17.263
Come on, you're gonna
be late for the party.

01:07:28.340 --> 01:07:31.433
Because nothing compares
to a new beginning.

01:07:32.980 --> 01:07:35.613
Actually, scratch that.

01:07:37.230 --> 01:07:38.977
An enchanted beginning.
