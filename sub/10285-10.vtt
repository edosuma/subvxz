WEBVTT

00:04.003 --> 00:05.039
Previously on ER:

00:05.073 --> 00:06.474
Would it be okay if I
stopped by the apartment?

00:06.507 --> 00:07.808
Yeah, sure, uh,
I think you've

00:07.841 --> 00:09.443
got some stuff
left in the hall closet.

00:09.477 --> 00:11.412
KOVAC:
Where have you been?

00:11.445 --> 00:12.746
I was worried.

00:12.780 --> 00:14.682
TAGGART:
I wanted to say thanks

00:14.715 --> 00:17.151
for suggesting I look
into the transport program.

00:17.185 --> 00:18.519
I'm going for it.

00:18.552 --> 00:20.121
You're one of those
smart girls, aren't you?

00:20.154 --> 00:22.656
You've only just noticed?

00:22.690 --> 00:24.425
LOCKHART:
Why do you do that?
KOVAC:
Do what?

00:24.458 --> 00:26.394
Drink in front of me.
I mean, you never once asked me

00:26.427 --> 00:28.729
was that okay with me or did
that bother me or was that...

00:28.762 --> 00:31.031
You used to have a problem.
You're much better now.

00:32.100 --> 00:33.401
My father died.

00:40.774 --> 00:43.544
Luka!

00:43.577 --> 00:45.379
Is the stroller in the car?

00:45.413 --> 00:47.515
No, it's down here
in the living room.

00:52.753 --> 00:54.555
Can we carry it
on the plane?

00:54.588 --> 00:57.858
Uh, no, we're going to have
to check it at the gate.

00:57.891 --> 01:01.629
KOVAC:
"And all through the house
not a creature was stirring,

01:01.662 --> 01:03.764
not even a mouse."

01:03.797 --> 01:05.233
(speaking Croatian)

01:05.266 --> 01:07.368
Mouse, huh?

01:10.771 --> 01:12.740
Okay.

01:12.773 --> 01:14.875
Okay, the flight is
at 10:00 tonight, right?

01:14.908 --> 01:16.677
I'm just gonna run

01:16.710 --> 01:18.179
a couple errands--
dry cleaners, the bank.

01:18.212 --> 01:20.181
It shouldn't
take very long.

01:20.214 --> 01:22.383
No, no, sweetheart, you stay
here with Daddy, okay?

01:22.416 --> 01:24.552
Let Daddy finish the book.
Joe, let's go

01:24.585 --> 01:26.154
look at the tree, huh?

01:26.187 --> 01:28.422
Help me count how many
Santas we got here.

01:31.759 --> 01:32.893
You okay?

01:32.926 --> 01:34.695
Yeah, are you?

01:34.728 --> 01:36.664
Yeah.

01:36.697 --> 01:38.766
I'll be back.
I'll be back in an hour or two.

01:38.799 --> 01:40.634
Okay? Bye.

01:43.771 --> 01:46.807
I saw Frosty The Snowman
on TV last night.

01:46.840 --> 01:48.709
It's December 6.
Yeah, I know.

01:48.742 --> 01:50.644
You know, by the time
the Yuletide actually gets here,

01:50.678 --> 01:52.746
you're already sick of it.
We work for the County

01:52.780 --> 01:54.782
which means they all
got to get equal time.

01:54.815 --> 01:57.451
Christmas,
Hanukkah, Kwanzaa.

01:57.485 --> 02:00.221
Why can't people
agree on one date
and be done with it?

02:00.254 --> 02:02.756
Damn, what a messed-up board!
Messed-up floor.

02:02.790 --> 02:04.458
It's like Calcutta
around here.

02:04.492 --> 02:06.927
Calcutta on a bad day.

02:06.960 --> 02:09.930
We signed 142
on the night shift.

02:09.963 --> 02:12.433
That's a new record.
Must be proud.

02:12.466 --> 02:13.701
I'm too tired
to go home.

02:13.734 --> 02:15.336
I'm gonna sleep
in the call room.

02:15.369 --> 02:16.937
Poor kid's a zombie.

02:16.970 --> 02:18.806
142, huh?

02:18.839 --> 02:20.574
Wait, we keep
this thing cranking,

02:20.608 --> 02:22.410
we could hit 300.
Yeah, right.

02:22.443 --> 02:23.944
Yeah, that'd be quite
a milestone.
Forget it.

02:23.977 --> 02:26.914
We've never had over 250
in a 24-hour period.

02:26.947 --> 02:28.349
Dare to dream big, Frank.

02:28.382 --> 02:29.783
We'd have to sign in, what?

02:29.817 --> 02:31.819
14 patients an hour
for the next 12 hours.

02:31.852 --> 02:33.887
It's never gonna happen.
I bet you 300 bucks

02:33.921 --> 02:35.956
we hit that mark by
the end of this shift.

02:35.989 --> 02:37.491
Too rich for me.
No, no, no.

02:37.525 --> 02:39.227
You guys could split it.

02:39.227 --> 02:40.794
Yeah, put up a hundred
each against my three.

02:40.828 --> 02:42.796
I'm in.
Oh, Lord, when
is he gonna learn?

02:42.830 --> 02:44.932
Looks like I'm gonna
be able to get the wife

02:44.965 --> 02:46.967
that newfangled toaster
she's been hinting for.

02:47.000 --> 02:49.437
Frank, you romantic fool.
Mm-hmm.

02:49.470 --> 02:50.738
Admin sent this down.

02:50.771 --> 02:52.240
Oh, put that by Trauma.

02:52.273 --> 02:53.774
New portable CT scanner.

02:53.807 --> 02:55.776
That's the holiday gift
for the ER.

02:55.809 --> 02:58.346
In lieu of the lovely
T-shirts we normally get.

02:58.379 --> 02:59.913
Oh, too bad.
I love those shirts.

02:59.947 --> 03:02.416
Hey, guys.
Everybody see my memo?

03:02.450 --> 03:03.817
Oh, I saw your memo.

03:03.851 --> 03:05.519
What memo?
What memo?

03:05.553 --> 03:07.455
I'm going around
to all the departments

03:07.488 --> 03:10.658
and I'm doing blessing
ceremonies and memorials.

03:10.691 --> 03:12.826
And today is
the ER's turn.

03:12.860 --> 03:16.864
Well, you know, that sounds nice
and very, uh... cleansing,

03:16.897 --> 03:18.732
but no, we're going
to be pretty busy.

03:18.766 --> 03:20.368
No, it's not
really our thing.

03:20.401 --> 03:21.769
Why don't you try Oncology?

03:21.802 --> 03:23.637
They love all that
touchy-feely crap.

03:23.671 --> 03:24.938
Come on, guys,
this could be cool.

03:24.972 --> 03:27.308
Enlightening, gratifying.

03:27.341 --> 03:28.876
Don't shoot the kid down.

03:28.909 --> 03:31.011
How open-minded
of you, Dr. Gates.

03:31.044 --> 03:33.013
Thank you. I do my best,
Miss Dupree.

03:33.046 --> 03:35.983
Good. So I'll see
you all later.

03:37.918 --> 03:39.853
Are you and her, uh...?

03:39.887 --> 03:41.289
Wait a second.

03:41.289 --> 03:42.890
Are you banging
the chaplain?

03:42.923 --> 03:46.394
TAGGART:
Pratt, hey, Pratt?

03:46.427 --> 03:48.562
Yeah?
Melissa Tanner, 61,

03:48.596 --> 03:49.997
restrained driver
of moderate velocity,

03:50.030 --> 03:51.765
TC and respiratory distress.

03:51.799 --> 03:53.301
Look at you. You're on
the chopper today, huh?

03:53.334 --> 03:54.568
Logging hours,
part of my transpo training.

03:54.602 --> 03:56.304
She's getting unresponsive.

03:56.304 --> 03:57.905
What's this scar
on her chest?
Looks like she had

03:57.938 --> 03:59.740
a thoracotomy;
stats are dropping.

03:59.773 --> 04:01.309
All right, here we go.
Hundred percent non-rebreather,

04:01.309 --> 04:02.676
and portable chest, here you go.

04:02.710 --> 04:04.912
Morris?
MORRIS:
What do we got here?

04:04.945 --> 04:06.914
That's her son, Lowell.

04:06.947 --> 04:09.383
Down's Syndrome, facial
lacs, a few contusions.

04:09.417 --> 04:10.984
Found walking
on the scene.

04:11.018 --> 04:12.986
Is Mommy okay?
Yeah, we're helping
her now, Lowell.

04:13.020 --> 04:14.988
Need me, Morris?
No, I got this.
Push some charts.

04:15.956 --> 04:17.925
Harold?

04:17.958 --> 04:19.927
Who you supposed
to be, Merlin?

04:19.959 --> 04:21.928
I need a ladder,
out in the bay.

04:21.962 --> 04:23.431
You need a ladder
for what?

04:23.464 --> 04:25.633
Holy cow, is that
what I think it is?

04:25.666 --> 04:27.535
It's not a cow, no.

04:27.568 --> 04:29.770
What's going on?

04:29.803 --> 04:31.939
RASGOTRA:
We had a dress rehearsal
for a hospital holiday pageant.

04:31.972 --> 04:33.941
DUBENKO:
Surgery drew the Nativity scene.

04:33.974 --> 04:35.576
Congratulations.

04:35.609 --> 04:38.045
And this, uh, camel
they got from somewhere

04:38.078 --> 04:39.913
bit Lucien on the leg.

04:39.947 --> 04:41.915
Well, why the hell
did you bring it here?

04:41.949 --> 04:44.017
Oh, we were just
down the street.

04:44.051 --> 04:45.819
Well, we need
to take a culture.

04:45.853 --> 04:47.455
You need a shave.

04:47.488 --> 04:49.357
There might be
an exotic organism

04:49.390 --> 04:51.024
that needs
targeted therapy, so...

04:59.767 --> 05:02.936
All right, let's
give this a shot.

05:02.970 --> 05:04.938
Here, my dad raised horses.

05:04.972 --> 05:07.107
Allow me.

05:07.140 --> 05:08.442
Okay, buddy.

05:08.476 --> 05:09.610
This won't hurt.

05:09.643 --> 05:10.711
Just a little bit.

05:10.744 --> 05:11.945
No, this'll be easy, come on.

05:11.979 --> 05:13.481
Whoa.

05:13.514 --> 05:15.683
Whoa, I'll get it.
I'll get it.

05:15.716 --> 05:17.451
Ho!

05:17.485 --> 05:18.819
Hey, just...

05:18.852 --> 05:20.454
She's not
a cooperative animal.

05:22.000 --> 05:28.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:43.944 --> 05:45.413
All right.

05:45.446 --> 05:48.416
Just... all right.

05:49.116 --> 05:51.885
Come here. All right.

05:51.919 --> 05:53.554
You know what? I'm staring
to think this is not such

05:53.587 --> 05:56.424
a good idea.
We've got to get
a swab, Tony.

06:01.194 --> 06:02.896
(sighs):
All right.

06:02.930 --> 06:05.533
Easy there, big fella.

06:07.768 --> 06:09.503
(phone rings)

06:09.537 --> 06:11.772
Oh, Harold, can you grab
my phone from my back pocket?

06:11.805 --> 06:14.875
Sure thing.

06:14.908 --> 06:17.645
DUBENKO:
We'll still have noon
conference, Neela.

06:17.678 --> 06:18.912
I made need you to make that fat

06:18.946 --> 06:20.147
embolus presentation without me.

06:20.180 --> 06:21.982
You have it
on your laptop, right?

06:22.015 --> 06:23.717
"Missed call: Abby."

06:23.751 --> 06:27.054
Yeah, but I left it at home.
Okay, well, you'll go home

06:27.087 --> 06:29.457
after morning
rounds and get it.

06:29.457 --> 06:31.759
Sorry about this.

06:33.226 --> 06:36.697
Hey, Neela, I left
a message on your cell.

06:36.730 --> 06:41.068
Um, I was just wondering
if you were home right now.

06:41.101 --> 06:45.038
Um, Luka's father died and we're
flying to Croatia tonight.

06:45.072 --> 06:46.640
And I left a few things
in the closet,

06:46.674 --> 06:48.676
so I thought I'd just
come by and pick 'em up.

06:48.709 --> 06:51.011
All right, talk to you later.

06:51.044 --> 06:52.880
Thanks for helping sell
those guys on the ceremony.

06:52.913 --> 06:54.715
Oh, I'll proselytize
for you any day.

06:54.748 --> 06:56.617
Nice to know
I have an acolyte.

06:58.986 --> 07:01.054
Pulse ox down to 84.

07:01.088 --> 07:03.056
No pneumothorax.
Any rib fractures?

07:03.090 --> 07:04.758
I don't think so.
Intubation tray.

07:04.792 --> 07:06.494
TAGGART:
Do you mind if I try?

07:06.527 --> 07:08.028
Come on, I need ten
supervised for my training.

07:08.061 --> 07:10.498
No, no, Sam, this isn't
a good teaching case.

07:10.531 --> 07:11.999
Patent airway,
it shouldn't be that tricky.

07:12.032 --> 07:14.001
She's had thoracic surgery
with lousy reserve.

07:14.034 --> 07:15.569
Once we paralyze,
every second counts.

07:15.603 --> 07:17.170
Aw, come on, give Sam a try.

07:18.071 --> 07:20.173
Here.

07:22.209 --> 07:23.611
Suction.

07:23.644 --> 07:24.812
20 of entomidate,
hundred of sux.

07:24.845 --> 07:26.814
MORRIS:
Oh, guys, this is cool.

07:26.847 --> 07:27.848
Hey, what's up with her kid?

07:27.881 --> 07:30.017
Oh, just a few scratches.

07:30.050 --> 07:32.586
Whoa, non-contrast scan
in 15 seconds.

07:32.620 --> 07:33.854
She's out.

07:33.887 --> 07:35.823
Go, go.

07:35.856 --> 07:37.591
How about we fire
this baby up?

07:37.625 --> 07:38.926
PRATT:
Quiet, Morris!

07:40.994 --> 07:42.630
Got it.
Nice.

07:42.663 --> 07:44.064
We're not radiating
every patient

07:44.097 --> 07:44.932
just because we got a new toy.

07:44.965 --> 07:46.534
Good breath sounds.

07:46.534 --> 07:48.001
HALEH:
End tidal is yellow.
All right, good,

07:48.035 --> 07:49.169
let's call for a vent.

07:49.202 --> 07:50.771
Hey, Morris, see if you can get

07:50.804 --> 07:52.072
the history from her son.

07:52.105 --> 07:53.273
Kid doesn't say much.

07:53.306 --> 07:54.908
I talked to him
on the chopper.

07:54.942 --> 07:56.944
Call for a portable chest.

07:56.977 --> 08:00.681
Okay, 151, 152, 153.

08:00.714 --> 08:02.249
What are you doing?
Just tracking the census.

08:02.282 --> 08:04.084
Sam, how's my mommy?

08:04.117 --> 08:05.653
She's doing
better, Lowell.

08:05.686 --> 08:07.154
We're helping her
breathe right now.

08:07.187 --> 08:09.122
Do you know if your mom
takes any medicine?

08:09.156 --> 08:10.223
Lots of pills.

08:10.257 --> 08:11.925
She's sick.

08:11.959 --> 08:14.562
Do you remember when
she had an operation?

08:16.063 --> 08:18.231
How about the name
of her doctor?

08:20.300 --> 08:22.235
It's okay.

08:22.269 --> 08:24.738
The husband's number was in
her wallet, so I'll call him.

08:24.772 --> 08:26.173
Going to call my dad?

08:26.206 --> 08:27.575
Mm-hmm.

08:29.710 --> 08:32.111
Continuous NG, recheck
lights in two hours,

08:32.145 --> 08:34.147
write the order, then go get
your PowerPoint file.

08:34.181 --> 08:36.283
I will do.
I'm going to be
upstairs in my office

08:36.316 --> 08:39.052
while my anti-camel
drip kicks in.

08:39.086 --> 08:40.253
Frank, I'm running home
for a bit.

08:40.287 --> 08:42.590
I should be about
half an hour.

08:42.590 --> 08:44.124
Dr. Zelinsky will start
with any consult orders
you might need.

08:44.157 --> 08:45.726
You mean Harold.
Mm-hmm.

08:45.759 --> 08:47.160
Please hurry back.
The husband of the woman

08:47.194 --> 08:49.329
we choppered in
is on his way here.
Okay.

08:49.362 --> 08:50.831
Hey, Sam.

08:50.864 --> 08:52.165
You coming to my séance?

08:52.199 --> 08:54.668
Oh, I'm off shift;
I'm pretty beat.

08:54.702 --> 08:55.936
That's too bad.

08:55.969 --> 08:57.805
Yeah, plus, to be honest,

08:57.838 --> 08:59.740
my relationship with religion
is kind of complicated.

08:59.773 --> 09:01.241
So is mine.

09:01.274 --> 09:04.177
But, you know, it's not
exactly a "religious" ceremony.

09:04.211 --> 09:07.114
Yeah, well, I was raised in
a pretty strict household.

09:07.147 --> 09:09.082
A lot of talk about "sin"
and "damnation,"

09:09.116 --> 09:10.784
And it never did
that much for me.

09:10.818 --> 09:13.153
Do you believe in God?

09:13.186 --> 09:15.155
Some days, it's tough.

09:15.188 --> 09:17.157
And other days?

09:17.190 --> 09:18.926
And other days,
I thank him for showing up.

09:18.959 --> 09:20.828
Or her or whatever.

09:20.861 --> 09:23.330
Well, if you change your mind

09:23.363 --> 09:26.266
about our get-together,
we'll be here.

09:28.168 --> 09:30.671
Sam, I hear you've been
riding rigs all over town.

09:30.704 --> 09:31.839
You never asked me.

09:31.872 --> 09:33.240
I go where they tell me, Zades.

09:33.273 --> 09:34.642
Sure wish I could get

09:34.642 --> 09:35.943
into that paramedic
conference today.

09:35.976 --> 09:37.778
What? Sternback's case review?

09:37.811 --> 09:39.747
Yeah, I hear it's
pretty interesting.

09:39.780 --> 09:41.715
He goes through every
tough ambulance run.

09:41.749 --> 09:44.718
Yeah, you can learn a lot.

09:44.752 --> 09:47.655
So, you coming or not?

09:47.655 --> 09:48.756
Can you get me in?

09:48.789 --> 09:50.924
I got connections.
Let's go.

09:50.958 --> 09:52.660
Yeah!

09:55.896 --> 09:57.831
Hi.

09:57.865 --> 10:00.233
Abby.

10:00.267 --> 10:01.835
I didn't know
you were coming over.

10:01.869 --> 10:03.403
Yeah, I left you
a couple messages.
Oh.

10:03.436 --> 10:06.173
No problem, I just need
to pick up my computer.

10:06.206 --> 10:07.841
You're watching TV?

10:07.875 --> 10:09.743
Oh, yeah, I was just
checking the weather.

10:12.880 --> 10:14.281
What's going on?

10:14.314 --> 10:16.316
I was running a few errands,

10:16.349 --> 10:18.251
and I remembered there was
a coat I left here

10:18.285 --> 10:19.920
that I wanted to pick up.

10:22.089 --> 10:23.857
And I had a drink.

10:23.891 --> 10:26.226
You had a drink?

10:26.259 --> 10:29.129
Yeah.

10:29.162 --> 10:31.098
What are you doing?

10:33.801 --> 10:35.268
Oh, geez...

10:35.302 --> 10:36.670
You know what, just forget it.

10:36.704 --> 10:38.138
I'm going to go.
Abby.

10:38.171 --> 10:41.274
Yeah, I'm just
going to go, okay?

10:41.308 --> 10:43.977
Is this what's been going on
these last few weeks?

10:44.011 --> 10:45.779
What? Is what?

10:45.813 --> 10:47.247
What's been going on
the past couple of weeks?

10:47.280 --> 10:49.316
The way you've been acting,
that night at Ike's,

10:49.349 --> 10:51.151
how far away you've seemed?
I mean, that time you asked
to come over here...

10:51.184 --> 10:53.253
You know what, Neela?
Sometimes you are such a child.

10:53.286 --> 10:54.788
Stop it. I'm trying
to help you.

10:54.822 --> 10:56.256
Well, I don't need it, really.

10:56.289 --> 10:58.058
You've got to stop this.

10:58.091 --> 10:59.860
Think about Joe, think about
Luka-- you have to...

10:59.893 --> 11:01.294
And I really don't expect you

11:01.328 --> 11:03.096
to even begin
to understand this.

11:03.130 --> 11:04.364
Well, if you love them,
you'll do something...

11:04.397 --> 11:07.200
"If I love them"?!

11:08.135 --> 11:09.737
Please.

11:09.737 --> 11:11.071
I'm your friend.

11:11.104 --> 11:12.940
Are you really about
to lecture me on love

11:12.973 --> 11:14.274
with your track record?

11:14.307 --> 11:16.043
Don't...
Because I'm thinking
right now

11:16.076 --> 11:18.411
Ray is really wishing
he didn't meet you.

11:18.445 --> 11:22.282
You don't... live here anymore.

11:22.315 --> 11:24.084
Get out!

11:37.264 --> 11:38.265
(door slamming)

11:38.298 --> 11:40.367
She has
end-stage emphysema.

11:40.400 --> 11:42.970
Used to smoke
three packs a day.

11:43.003 --> 11:45.973
She still tries to sneak one
every now and then.

11:46.006 --> 11:47.307
Yeah, we noticed the
scar on her chest.

11:47.340 --> 11:50.277
Yeah, she had, um,
lung reduction surgery

11:50.310 --> 11:51.812
about ten years ago.

11:51.845 --> 11:54.247
It worked, I mean,
it worked for a while.

11:54.281 --> 11:59.186
But she's been on home oxygen
24/7 for almost a year now.

11:59.219 --> 12:00.954
PRATT:
We didn't realize.

12:00.988 --> 12:03.490
We thought maybe her lungs
were bruised in the collision.

12:03.523 --> 12:08.361
No. She shouldn't
have been driving.

12:08.395 --> 12:09.897
She knows that.

12:09.930 --> 12:11.899
I offered to hire a driver.

12:11.932 --> 12:15.535
Well, the ventilator is
helping her to breathe.

12:15.568 --> 12:19.506
No, no, she's a DNR.

12:19.539 --> 12:22.843
She does not want to be
kept alive by a machine.

12:22.876 --> 12:24.912
PRATT:
Well, we can take
off the support,

12:24.945 --> 12:27.147
if that's what you
and your son decide.

12:27.180 --> 12:28.916
He didn't say
anything about it.

12:28.949 --> 12:30.383
My what?

12:30.417 --> 12:32.920
Your son-- Lowell.

12:32.953 --> 12:35.823
He's right there
in the next room.

12:38.291 --> 12:41.829
I-I don't know who that is.

12:41.829 --> 12:44.264
ZADRO:
So, you thinking
of making a change?

12:44.297 --> 12:45.298
Maybe.

12:45.332 --> 12:47.200
Had enough, huh?

12:47.234 --> 12:48.902
I don't know.

12:48.936 --> 12:52.873
I was a traveler for a long time
before I got to Chicago.

12:52.906 --> 12:56.143
I've been a nurse at County
for over four years now.

12:56.176 --> 12:57.410
Kind of weird for me.

12:57.444 --> 12:59.112
I used to be wired for change.

12:59.146 --> 13:00.180
Whoa! Hold on!

13:00.213 --> 13:01.882
SAM:
Watch it!

13:20.934 --> 13:23.036
(train rumbling)

13:28.208 --> 13:31.444
(panting)

13:31.478 --> 13:33.046
Hey, you okay, Sam?

13:33.080 --> 13:34.114
Yeah. You?

13:34.147 --> 13:36.449
I banged up my knee.

13:44.057 --> 13:45.893
You all right?

13:47.227 --> 13:49.629
I... think...

13:49.662 --> 13:51.464
there's a kid...

13:52.432 --> 13:54.001
Hey, Zadro!

13:54.034 --> 13:55.135
Stay in the car.

13:57.270 --> 13:58.906
WOMAN:
Evie!

13:58.939 --> 14:00.908
Hey, I'm a nurse.
My name is Sam.

14:00.941 --> 14:02.342
I'm going
to help you, okay?
Evie!

14:02.375 --> 14:03.543
ZADRO:
Hey, honey,
what's your name?
Oh, God!

14:03.576 --> 14:04.978
Oh, God!
Evie.

14:05.012 --> 14:06.379
Evie.
Where do you hurt, Evie?

14:06.413 --> 14:08.916
Evie...
Down there.

14:08.916 --> 14:09.950
No obvious head trauma.

14:09.983 --> 14:11.118
Did that car hit her?

14:11.151 --> 14:12.152
I'm all right, Mom.

14:12.185 --> 14:13.186
Where's Nina?

14:13.220 --> 14:14.387
Who's Nina?

14:14.421 --> 14:16.356
My dog.
MOTHER:
Is she okay?

14:16.389 --> 14:18.191
She might have a broken bone
in her pelvis,

14:18.225 --> 14:19.292
but everything else seems good.

14:19.326 --> 14:20.928
What about her neck?

14:20.961 --> 14:22.095
ZADRO:
She must have bruised it
on the way down.

14:22.129 --> 14:23.330
You breathing okay?

14:23.363 --> 14:24.564
Yeah.
ZADRO:
Sats are good.

14:24.597 --> 14:26.599
BP 118 over 76.

14:26.633 --> 14:28.635
Hey! Stay there, sir!

14:28.668 --> 14:30.170
MAN:
Is that brother drunk?

14:30.203 --> 14:32.039
I bet his dumb ass he's drunk.

14:32.072 --> 14:33.306
WOMAN: Evie...
MAN: Ain't nothing
but liquor stores

14:33.340 --> 14:35.042
and churches around here!

14:35.075 --> 14:38.045
Hey, Sam, go check him.
I'll call for backup.

14:38.078 --> 14:40.480
Excuse me, coming through.

14:40.513 --> 14:42.015
Hey, asshole.

14:42.049 --> 14:43.416
You hit a kid, man.
You been drinking?

14:43.450 --> 14:45.118
Hey, come on,
back off, okay?

14:45.152 --> 14:46.286
You hit a little girl!

14:46.319 --> 14:47.420
What is your name, sir?

14:47.454 --> 14:50.090
Uh... Del.

14:50.123 --> 14:52.092
Uh, Del, do you
remember anything?

14:52.125 --> 14:53.426
You know what happened?

14:53.460 --> 14:55.428
When?

14:58.465 --> 14:59.699
Here you go.

14:59.732 --> 15:02.169
Oh, thank you.

15:02.202 --> 15:03.236
Mind if I, uh...

15:03.270 --> 15:04.671
No, no.

15:04.704 --> 15:06.673
Thanks.

15:06.706 --> 15:09.276
(sighs)

15:09.309 --> 15:13.346
What's his name?

15:13.380 --> 15:15.448
His name is Lowell.

15:17.484 --> 15:20.553
Lowell.

15:20.587 --> 15:24.491
Look, I'm sorry
you had to find out this way.

15:24.524 --> 15:27.060
That your wife had a kid
with someone else.

15:27.094 --> 15:29.062
Oh, no, no.

15:29.096 --> 15:32.465
No, that wasn't it.

15:32.499 --> 15:37.337
Melissa and I were...
we were in our forties.

15:37.370 --> 15:40.407
We thought
we were past our...

15:40.440 --> 15:42.475
having children time.

15:42.509 --> 15:44.411
Then she got pregnant.

15:44.444 --> 15:47.414
That was in 1983.

15:50.317 --> 15:54.321
I knew something was wrong
right away.

15:54.354 --> 15:59.726
I could tell by the... the looks
on the doctors' faces.

15:59.759 --> 16:03.063
They told us about
Down's syndrome.

16:03.096 --> 16:07.134
We realized
how hard it would be.

16:09.602 --> 16:12.039
We weren't ready for it.

16:12.072 --> 16:14.141
I convinced her

16:14.174 --> 16:17.510
that it would be better...

16:17.544 --> 16:23.516
that it would be...
better for all of us.

16:23.550 --> 16:26.519
What would?

16:26.553 --> 16:28.055
Giving him up?

16:32.259 --> 16:35.095
Do you know why
he was in the car with her?

16:35.128 --> 16:36.529
Hey, Pratt.

16:36.563 --> 16:38.631
You seen Skye?

16:42.302 --> 16:44.537
You should ask him.

16:44.571 --> 16:46.539
Yeah.

16:46.573 --> 16:47.740
Huh? What?

16:47.774 --> 16:49.309
LOCKHART:
She's not in her office.

16:49.342 --> 16:51.311
She's not on today.
What's up?

16:51.344 --> 16:53.146
Uh, Luka's father
passed away.

16:53.180 --> 16:55.482
What? Oh, I'm sorry
to hear that.

16:55.515 --> 16:57.617
Yeah. So, we're, uh, we're
leaving for Croatia tonight.

16:57.650 --> 16:59.319
I need to take a
leave of absence,

16:59.352 --> 17:00.420
I figured she's the one
to talk to, right?

17:00.453 --> 17:01.521
Hey, you okay?
Yeah.

17:01.554 --> 17:03.090
You sure?
Yeah, I'm sure.

17:03.123 --> 17:04.424
I mean, his father
just died.

17:04.457 --> 17:06.093
Give me a break.
(sighs)

17:06.126 --> 17:09.096
All right, well...
fill out the paperwork.

17:09.128 --> 17:11.598
And... I'll tell
Skye about it.

17:11.631 --> 17:13.233
Thanks.

17:15.435 --> 17:16.769
A little oxygen in your nose.

17:16.803 --> 17:18.105
Okay.

17:18.105 --> 17:19.472
I think the girl
stopped moving.

17:19.506 --> 17:21.273
I saw her get hit;
it was bad.

17:21.308 --> 17:22.642
Think she
could die?
No.

17:22.675 --> 17:24.277
You should go help
with the girl.

17:24.310 --> 17:25.845
Paramedics are with her.
This jerk's so wrecked,

17:25.877 --> 17:27.146
he feeling no pain.

17:27.180 --> 17:28.581
He's concussed,
he's not drunk.

17:28.615 --> 17:30.317
Come on, that girl
needs you more.

17:30.350 --> 17:33.253
Hey! Why don't you back off

17:33.286 --> 17:35.355
and let me do my work, okay?

17:35.388 --> 17:36.423
Okay.

17:36.456 --> 17:38.125
Give her some room.

17:38.158 --> 17:39.759
Yeah. Thank you.
We're cool.
We're cool.

17:39.792 --> 17:41.228
Hey!
Oh!
Oh, man!

17:41.261 --> 17:43.596
Hey!
Little drunk bitch!

17:43.630 --> 17:44.831
SAM:
Hey!
Whoa!

17:44.864 --> 17:46.199
Hey, Zadro!

17:46.233 --> 17:48.401
Oh!

17:48.435 --> 17:50.137
MAN:
Whoa!

17:51.438 --> 17:53.273
Frank, I need two more charts.

17:53.306 --> 17:54.374
You're pathetic.

17:54.407 --> 17:55.475
No, it's the funniest thing.

17:55.508 --> 17:56.843
As I was getting
my coffee,

17:56.876 --> 17:59.612
I noticed that Conchita
has carpal tunnel

17:59.646 --> 18:00.680
from working
the register.

18:00.713 --> 18:02.515
Ay! Si me duele mucho.

18:02.549 --> 18:06.553
Yeah, and Bheru, here, has a bad
back from lifting heavy boxes.

18:06.586 --> 18:09.756
I'm thinking...
I slipped a disk.

18:09.789 --> 18:10.790
Bring it on, Morris.

18:10.823 --> 18:12.392
We haven't even hit 200.

18:12.425 --> 18:13.826
Are you serious?

18:13.860 --> 18:15.362
Give me your card
and PIN number.

18:15.395 --> 18:17.830
I'll save you a trip
to the ATM.

18:17.864 --> 18:19.632
It's not over till
it's over, Frank.

18:19.666 --> 18:22.635
A fool and his money
are soon parted, Morris!

18:22.669 --> 18:26.639
Labs are back,
vitals are stable.

18:26.673 --> 18:29.642
Well, everything...
everything looks good.

18:29.676 --> 18:31.644
No serious injuries, Lowell.

18:31.678 --> 18:36.749
Mommy was taking me
to a new place to live.

18:40.320 --> 18:44.224
You know,
your mom's not doing well.

18:44.257 --> 18:46.659
She needs air.

18:46.693 --> 18:49.329
She's getting sicker.

18:49.362 --> 18:52.265
Mommy comes every Thursday.

18:52.299 --> 18:53.833
But she's too sick now.

18:53.866 --> 18:56.669
Is my dad here?

18:56.703 --> 18:59.206
I-I heard he's coming.

18:59.206 --> 19:00.673
Which one is he?

19:00.707 --> 19:02.675
I can find out,

19:02.709 --> 19:04.444
and I'll, I'll bring you to him.

19:04.477 --> 19:06.279
No.

19:06.313 --> 19:08.681
Oh, you... you don't want
to meet him?

19:08.715 --> 19:11.584
He didn't want me
when I was a baby.

19:11.618 --> 19:16.289
Uh, you know, dads can
change their minds.

19:16.323 --> 19:17.624
Really?

19:17.657 --> 19:18.958
Really.

19:18.991 --> 19:23.730
Yeah, my dad was kind of
like your dad.

19:23.763 --> 19:26.233
Did he change his mind?

19:27.834 --> 19:29.769
I like to think he did.

19:33.773 --> 19:35.442
Oh, hi, Abby.

19:35.475 --> 19:36.809
Hi.

19:37.777 --> 19:39.246
Sorry.
Do you mind?

19:39.279 --> 19:40.580
I have to...
Yeah.

19:40.613 --> 19:41.748
What are you doing?

19:41.781 --> 19:43.583
You haven't heard?

19:43.616 --> 19:46.586
We're doing a memorial
and blessing ceremony.

19:46.619 --> 19:48.588
Oh.

19:48.621 --> 19:50.657
Who's bringing the Kool-Aid?

19:50.690 --> 19:54.327
It's nothing scary,
don't worry.

19:54.361 --> 19:56.663
You should come,
check it out.

19:56.696 --> 19:59.566
Uh, no, I-I
don't think so.

19:59.599 --> 20:02.869
Oh, everyone could use
a blessing now and then.

20:02.902 --> 20:05.538
Or a memorial.

20:06.906 --> 20:09.776
Abby, do I piss you off?

20:09.809 --> 20:12.011
Excuse me?

20:12.044 --> 20:13.746
I was wondering...

20:13.780 --> 20:16.583
No, you don't piss me off.

20:16.616 --> 20:19.819
I-I don't know...
know you really.

20:19.852 --> 20:21.588
Because if
there was ever anything

20:21.621 --> 20:22.655
you needed to talk about...

20:22.689 --> 20:24.924
Why would I need that?

20:24.957 --> 20:27.327
It's kind of why I'm here.

20:27.360 --> 20:28.961
Okay.

20:36.803 --> 20:38.771
You know,
there's this story...

20:38.805 --> 20:40.673
I know, I know.

20:40.707 --> 20:42.642
Bear with me.

20:42.675 --> 20:45.612
It's about this little boy
who asks his mother,

20:45.645 --> 20:48.881
"Do you think I can pick up
that big rock over there?"

20:48.915 --> 20:50.783
And she says, "Yes,

20:50.817 --> 20:54.787
I'm certain you can lift it
if you use all your strength."

20:54.821 --> 20:58.491
So, he goes over and
he tries to lift the rock.

20:58.525 --> 21:00.393
He tries a bunch of times,

21:00.427 --> 21:03.830
until finally, he says,
"I couldn't do it."

21:03.863 --> 21:06.399
So, she goes over there,

21:06.433 --> 21:08.968
and together,
they lift the rock.

21:09.001 --> 21:11.771
Wow, that's great.

21:11.804 --> 21:14.807
And she explains to him

21:14.841 --> 21:20.347
that, sometimes, using all your
strength means asking for help.

21:20.347 --> 21:23.883
HALEH:
The floor is under control;
we got no incoming traumas.

21:23.916 --> 21:25.552
MARQUEZ:
Want us to round up
the troops?

21:25.585 --> 21:29.456
JULIA:
Yeah. Let's get
while the getting's good.

21:36.796 --> 21:37.830
Ooh!

21:37.864 --> 21:39.065
Sorry.
Sorry.

21:39.098 --> 21:40.600
Sorry, Neela.
No, it's my fault.

21:40.633 --> 21:41.834
My mind was somewhere else.

21:41.868 --> 21:43.069
Ah, me too.

21:43.102 --> 21:44.904
Um, I heard
about your father.

21:44.937 --> 21:46.373
I'm sorry.
Thanks.

21:46.373 --> 21:47.774
Yeah, just when
I thought

21:47.807 --> 21:49.609
he was out of the
woods for awhile...

21:49.642 --> 21:51.043
Have you seen
Abby today?

21:51.077 --> 21:52.745
Something the matter?

21:52.779 --> 21:55.415
No. She was supposed
to be home a while ago.

21:55.448 --> 21:56.849
She must have gotten caught up
with something here.

21:56.883 --> 21:58.585
(siren whoops)

21:58.618 --> 22:02.689
Yeah, maybe she got
caught up with some work.

22:13.433 --> 22:16.068
The names of those
who passed on

22:16.102 --> 22:17.637
while under our care.

22:18.971 --> 22:22.775
We take time from our busy day
to pay respect

22:22.809 --> 22:25.678
to the mothers and fathers,

22:25.712 --> 22:28.748
husbands and wives,

22:28.781 --> 22:31.784
sisters and brothers,

22:31.818 --> 22:34.120
sons and daughters,

22:34.153 --> 22:35.988
who are no longer with us.

22:37.724 --> 22:41.561
Think of one patient
who's changed you in some way.

22:41.594 --> 22:43.596
Hold them in your memory.

22:44.597 --> 22:46.766
Were they inspiring?

22:46.799 --> 22:48.701
Funny?

22:49.569 --> 22:51.604
Courageous?

22:51.638 --> 22:54.607
Did they challenge you?

22:54.641 --> 22:56.676
Teach you something
about yourself?

23:01.213 --> 23:03.149
Were they searching
for something?

23:05.217 --> 23:07.454
Was their heart...

23:07.454 --> 23:09.922
...filled with love?

23:11.724 --> 23:13.693
As you hold them
in your mind...

23:13.726 --> 23:17.797
ask yourself
which of their qualities

23:17.830 --> 23:19.866
can become part of my life?

23:19.899 --> 23:21.801
Sorry. Multiple
trauma rolling in.

23:21.834 --> 23:23.035
I waited as long as I could.

23:23.069 --> 23:24.704
We'll finish this
another time.

23:24.737 --> 23:26.172
FRANK:
I'll call the blood bank.

23:26.205 --> 23:28.808
(all talking at once)

23:28.841 --> 23:30.910
Blunt trauma,
auto versus ped.

23:42.254 --> 23:45.191
You said you'd be
back an hour ago.

23:45.224 --> 23:46.593
I didn't know where you were.

23:46.626 --> 23:48.595
Well, here I am.

24:09.682 --> 24:11.584
MORRIS: No way.
Anatomy's distorted.

24:13.119 --> 24:14.754
I thought her
breathing was okay.

24:14.787 --> 24:17.023
It was.
Someone grab
the fiber-optic scope.

24:17.056 --> 24:18.257
I'll bag her up.
Is there a
problem?

24:18.290 --> 24:20.059
MOTHER: What are
you doing-- tell me.

24:20.092 --> 24:21.528
Joyce... Maybe you should
wait outside for now.

24:21.561 --> 24:23.563
No, no, no,
I need to be here.

24:23.596 --> 24:25.765
Just give us
a few minutes, okay?

24:25.798 --> 24:27.767
You said it
was a scratch.

24:27.800 --> 24:29.201
There's more swelling
in her throat.

24:31.137 --> 24:32.639
So she can't breathe?

24:32.672 --> 24:34.607
We're helping her.

24:34.641 --> 24:36.743
Would you like
to sit down?

24:36.776 --> 24:41.080
Oh, my God...
Oh, my God.

24:41.113 --> 24:42.615
(sobbing):
Oh, my God.

24:42.649 --> 24:44.951
(crying)

24:44.984 --> 24:46.285
My baby.

24:46.318 --> 24:47.920
Oh, my God.

24:51.123 --> 24:52.625
My baby's hurt.

24:57.864 --> 24:59.632
You're Lowell's dad?

24:59.666 --> 25:00.933
Yeah.

25:00.967 --> 25:03.202
Have the balls
to go in there.

25:08.274 --> 25:09.776
LOCKHART:
I don't know
what to tell you.

25:09.809 --> 25:11.243
Start with
what's going on.
Nothing!

25:11.277 --> 25:12.679
If you don't want
to come back

25:12.712 --> 25:13.813
to Croatia with me,
then say that.

25:13.846 --> 25:15.247
No, that's not it.
Then what?

25:15.281 --> 25:17.116
It's just a lot to
deal with, that's all.

25:20.019 --> 25:22.822
Since I got back, you
haven't seemed happy.

25:22.855 --> 25:24.757
You avoid me; we've
hardly touched each other.

25:24.791 --> 25:25.992
Do you think I'm blind?
Don't be ridiculous.

25:26.025 --> 25:28.260
Am I?

25:28.294 --> 25:30.930
Look, you were just
gone... forever.

25:30.963 --> 25:32.098
It was a lot
of stress.

25:32.131 --> 25:33.165
taking care of Joe
and supporting us.

25:33.199 --> 25:34.233
Supporting us...

25:34.266 --> 25:35.201
Yeah, you weren't
working, Luka.

25:35.234 --> 25:36.603
There were bills to pay.

25:36.603 --> 25:37.804
All we had was
my resident's hours.

25:37.837 --> 25:38.838
So you're mad
I wasn't working?

25:38.871 --> 25:40.607
No, that's not it-- no.

25:40.607 --> 25:43.042
It's just hard for me
to just turn it back on.

25:43.075 --> 25:44.911
Turn what back on?

25:44.944 --> 25:46.879
When... when did
it turn off?

25:50.149 --> 25:52.051
I know you.

25:52.084 --> 25:53.653
I know when
something's wrong.

25:57.857 --> 25:59.025
Do you still love me?

25:59.058 --> 26:00.993
Oh, my God!
Of course I still love you.

26:01.027 --> 26:02.094
Why would you even ask me that?

26:02.128 --> 26:03.195
Why the hell do you think?

26:03.229 --> 26:04.631
Just talk to me-- hey!

26:08.635 --> 26:11.037
Look, I have to go and
finish my leave request,

26:11.070 --> 26:12.238
and then we'll
go to Croatia

26:12.271 --> 26:13.272
and then everything
will be different.

26:15.074 --> 26:16.776
Okay?

26:19.045 --> 26:21.380
You can't just hide
forever, you know.

26:21.413 --> 26:22.782
You can't.

26:27.219 --> 26:28.354
Hey. Wait.

26:28.387 --> 26:30.723
I'll see you at home.

26:36.428 --> 26:39.231
All I can see are
arytenoid folds.

26:39.265 --> 26:40.733
Sats are way down.

26:40.767 --> 26:42.134
Okay, let's do
a surgical airway.

26:42.168 --> 26:43.369
She's too young to crike.

26:43.402 --> 26:44.904
You want a formal trake?
Prep the neck.

26:44.937 --> 26:47.106
An open trake'll take too long.
20 minutes.

26:47.139 --> 26:48.307
She doesn't have 20 minutes.

26:48.340 --> 26:50.009
What about, uh,
jet ventillation?

26:50.042 --> 26:51.844
That requires
a regulator.
And a release valve.

26:51.878 --> 26:53.846
By the time you get
that from Central,
she'll be traked.

26:53.880 --> 26:55.281
I can do it
with a nasal cannula.

26:55.314 --> 26:57.249
Get out of here.
It'll take me 30 seconds.

26:57.283 --> 26:59.218
Fine. You have till
we're gloved and gowned.
Lost the pulse.

26:59.251 --> 27:01.220
PEA. I'm starting
compressions.

27:04.256 --> 27:07.794
You're sure he-he,
uh, wants to meet me?

27:07.827 --> 27:10.329
He was asking
the same question.

27:15.301 --> 27:17.269
Will, uh...

27:17.303 --> 27:20.106
Will you come in with me?

27:20.139 --> 27:22.241
It's not a problem.

27:29.415 --> 27:32.351
Someone's here
to see you.

27:41.828 --> 27:44.864
Hello.

27:44.897 --> 27:47.934
My name is Pierce.

27:47.967 --> 27:50.903
My name is Lowell.

27:50.937 --> 27:52.739
Lowell.

28:00.880 --> 28:02.381
Lowell...

28:02.414 --> 28:04.951
I'm your father.

28:04.984 --> 28:06.953
Nice to meet you.

28:10.890 --> 28:14.026
SAM:
Okay, Morris, steady the hub.

28:14.060 --> 28:15.394
Nasal cannula at 15.

28:17.429 --> 28:19.098
DUBENKO:
Okay. Ten blade.

28:19.131 --> 28:20.900
Suction.

28:20.933 --> 28:22.334
When I cover
the open prong,

28:22.368 --> 28:24.303
she's gonna get a
blast of oxygen.

28:24.336 --> 28:25.471
Hold CPR.

28:28.407 --> 28:29.408
That's hot.

28:31.010 --> 28:32.311
SAM:
One second on, four off.

28:32.344 --> 28:33.379
Where'd you learn this?

28:33.412 --> 28:34.413
Transport training.

28:34.446 --> 28:35.782
Got a pulse.

28:35.782 --> 28:37.016
Gates needs a surgeon now.

28:37.049 --> 28:38.050
Yeah, I got it.

28:38.084 --> 28:39.151
BP 10/60.

28:39.185 --> 28:40.186
Big epidural.

28:40.219 --> 28:41.253
She blew a pupil.

28:41.287 --> 28:42.521
Heart rate's dropping.

28:42.554 --> 28:44.190
Atropine.
Two amps didn't
touch him.

28:44.223 --> 28:45.792
He needs O.R.

28:45.792 --> 28:47.359
He'll never make
it to the O.R.
70/50.

28:47.393 --> 28:49.095
Dopamine.
Hey, what about

28:49.128 --> 28:51.397
a burr hole?
We need a drill
from upstairs.

28:51.430 --> 28:53.399
Hold on-- he got kicked in the
head with the toe of a boot.

28:53.432 --> 28:55.201
Show me the
bone windows.
All right.

28:55.234 --> 28:57.269
He's seizing.
All right,
four of Atavan.

28:57.303 --> 28:59.205
You know it looks like
a circular skull fracture.

28:59.238 --> 29:01.808
RASGOTRA:
Oh, brilliant.
Prep for a cut-down.

29:01.841 --> 29:03.843
Sorry your thing
got interrupted.

29:03.876 --> 29:05.344
Oh.

29:05.377 --> 29:07.046
Life in the ER, I guess.

29:07.079 --> 29:09.181
We'll finish later.

29:11.450 --> 29:14.120
Why did you tell me
that story before?

29:14.153 --> 29:15.354
I like it.

29:15.387 --> 29:17.189
And I thought
you might, too.

29:17.223 --> 29:19.892
Hey, Frank, did that
fax come in yet
for Melissa Tanner?

29:19.926 --> 29:22.361
Greg, thanks for taking
care of this thing
with Skye for me.

29:22.394 --> 29:24.530
Oh... let Luka know
we're thinking about him.

29:24.563 --> 29:26.065
Thanks.

29:26.098 --> 29:27.834
Fax is right here
on the chart.

29:27.834 --> 29:29.836
That the DNR?

29:29.836 --> 29:30.837
Yep.

29:30.870 --> 29:33.372
No intubation, no CPR.

29:33.405 --> 29:35.842
Is the husband comfortable
honoring her wishes?

29:35.875 --> 29:37.043
Yeah.

29:37.076 --> 29:39.045
So, I guess we extubate.

29:39.078 --> 29:41.313
And she's going to die
in a few hours.

29:41.347 --> 29:43.950
Lowell needs to
understand that.

29:43.983 --> 29:45.985
Doesn't seem right.

29:46.018 --> 29:47.453
The kid's never had
a real family.

29:47.486 --> 29:50.456
And on the same day that
they finally get together,

29:50.489 --> 29:52.391
he's going
to lose his mom.

29:52.424 --> 29:54.393
Makes me want to
call my folks.

29:54.426 --> 29:56.495
(sighs)

29:58.430 --> 30:01.400
You okay?

30:01.433 --> 30:03.402
My mom died when
I was a kid.

30:03.435 --> 30:05.504
Breast cancer.

30:07.206 --> 30:09.175
We were close...

30:09.208 --> 30:12.411
and I lost her
pretty early.

30:12.444 --> 30:15.414
I don't even know why
I'm even talking about this.

30:15.447 --> 30:17.416
Must be that time of year,
you know?

30:17.449 --> 30:20.987
I'll go talk to them.

30:21.020 --> 30:22.588
JARVIK:
Heart rate's down 20.

30:22.621 --> 30:24.223
(alarms blaring)
All right,
start pacing him.

30:24.256 --> 30:25.892
You know he's going
to arrest soon.

30:25.925 --> 30:28.360
Elevating the fragment.
Suction.

30:28.394 --> 30:31.197
What the hell is all this?

30:31.230 --> 30:33.365
Draining
an epidural bleed.

30:33.399 --> 30:35.134
You did a burr hole?

30:35.167 --> 30:37.003
We didn't have to.
Heart rate's 80.
Bounding pulse.

30:37.036 --> 30:39.638
(alarms quiet)
Oh, mayday hits a
three-pointer at the buzzer.

30:39.671 --> 30:41.340
You people are crazy.

30:41.373 --> 30:43.342
I'm going to go
and help Dubenko
with the trake.

30:43.375 --> 30:44.944
I'll be right there.

30:44.977 --> 30:47.013
Heard you were a seasoned pro
out there today.

30:47.046 --> 30:49.315
Oh, you would think that.
I hit somebody.

30:49.348 --> 30:50.917
How is that?
How are you?

30:50.950 --> 30:53.085
Uh, yeah, I've had worse.

30:55.387 --> 30:56.989
Harold, what's next?

30:57.023 --> 30:58.190
Chuny, I got this.

30:58.224 --> 30:59.358
ZELINSKY:
Uh, vertical incision

30:59.391 --> 31:00.392
through the third
and fourth.

31:00.426 --> 31:01.660
You bitch!

31:01.693 --> 31:03.162
Remember that girl
you were so worried about?

31:03.195 --> 31:04.630
Well, we're trying to
save her now, jerk-off.

31:04.663 --> 31:06.165
Yeah, well, they got plenty
of doctors here.

31:06.198 --> 31:07.533
You messed me up
pretty good!

31:07.566 --> 31:09.635
Hey, this is a sterile
procedure, sir.
Hey!

31:09.668 --> 31:10.636
I need you to step back!
Hey! Hey!

31:15.407 --> 31:17.209
Get off me!

31:17.243 --> 31:19.145
Get off me!
Stay down!

31:19.178 --> 31:20.246
Don't move!

31:20.279 --> 31:23.149
Get off me!
Don't move!

31:23.182 --> 31:25.184
Not so tough now, are you?

31:26.385 --> 31:28.620
Lowell, a long
time ago,

31:28.654 --> 31:30.289
your mom decided she didn't want

31:30.322 --> 31:31.557
to be put
on a breathing machine.

31:31.590 --> 31:33.592
She wants to die?

31:33.625 --> 31:35.995
Not exactly, no.

31:36.028 --> 31:42.468
Son, living on the
machine, she wouldn't...

31:42.501 --> 31:46.572
she wouldn't be able to do
things that she loved.

31:46.605 --> 31:52.111
She... she wouldn't
be able to visit you.

31:52.144 --> 31:54.413
She's be stuck
in the bed,

31:54.446 --> 31:58.417
unable to walk or talk or eat.

31:58.450 --> 32:01.153
She'd just get sicker
and sicker.

32:01.187 --> 32:03.322
Mommy...

32:06.325 --> 32:09.428
...are you sure you don't
want the machine?

32:13.132 --> 32:16.035
She doesn't want it.

32:16.068 --> 32:19.005
That means, in
a little while,

32:19.038 --> 32:21.007
we're going
to pull out that tube.

32:21.007 --> 32:22.608
Okay.

32:22.641 --> 32:25.744
And she'll probably die
not too long

32:25.777 --> 32:27.546
after that.

32:27.579 --> 32:29.115
(voice breaking):
Could she get better?

32:29.148 --> 32:32.184
I don't think so, Lowell.

32:32.218 --> 32:33.585
But she might?

32:33.619 --> 32:35.421
PIERCE:
Well...

32:35.454 --> 32:37.423
Lowell, we'll
pray for that.

32:37.456 --> 32:39.158
We'll pray for that.

32:39.191 --> 32:41.260
Mommy...

32:41.293 --> 32:44.330
you don't have to die today.

32:51.603 --> 32:53.739
KOVAC:
So, we're gonna go
on the airplane.

32:53.772 --> 32:55.741
Can you say airplane, huh?

32:55.774 --> 32:58.077
(speaking Croatian)

32:59.745 --> 33:01.613
Hey.
Hey.

33:01.647 --> 33:03.315
Huh? It's...

33:03.349 --> 33:04.383
(speaking Croatian)

33:04.416 --> 33:06.518
With the
propeller, huh?

33:06.552 --> 33:08.687
Yeah, put it here
and go...

33:08.720 --> 33:10.622
(imitates airplane engine)

33:10.656 --> 33:12.591
Hmm?

33:12.624 --> 33:13.625
Huh?

33:13.659 --> 33:15.061
(speaking Croatian)

33:15.094 --> 33:16.495
Where's Niko?

33:16.528 --> 33:19.231
Uh, he went to buy
a present for his wife.

33:19.265 --> 33:21.067
Huh?

33:21.100 --> 33:24.436
(speaking quietly, gently)

33:24.470 --> 33:27.206
And are we ready
to fly now?

33:27.239 --> 33:31.343
Ready to fly...
We're going to fly.

33:31.377 --> 33:33.579
Where are we going to put
Joe in the airplane?

33:33.612 --> 33:36.515
Want a window seat?
Huh?

33:36.548 --> 33:38.484
Joe...

33:38.517 --> 33:40.519
(kisses)

33:42.654 --> 33:45.091
(kissing)

33:48.094 --> 33:50.496
(sighs)

33:58.404 --> 34:01.540
Luka, I need help.

34:25.364 --> 34:27.699
(rain pattering outside)

34:42.914 --> 34:46.252
I started
drinking again.

34:51.523 --> 34:53.192
When?

34:53.225 --> 34:55.460
The night Joe
got hurt.

34:59.465 --> 35:03.402
And I...

35:03.435 --> 35:05.271
I can't stop.

35:16.548 --> 35:18.317
I thought when I came back,

35:18.350 --> 35:21.220
we just needed to get used
to being married again.

35:24.190 --> 35:27.826
And then things didn't get
better, and I thought...

35:35.601 --> 35:37.203
So what do we do?

35:37.236 --> 35:39.571
I need to fix it.

35:39.605 --> 35:42.241
(sighs)

35:42.274 --> 35:43.575
I need to go somewhere--

35:43.609 --> 35:46.578
a facility
with professionals--

35:46.612 --> 35:48.580
and get better.

35:48.614 --> 35:50.582
And I need to believe
it this time,

35:50.616 --> 35:52.351
and I need you
to believe it.

35:54.953 --> 35:56.855
And I need you
to help me.

36:00.492 --> 36:02.694
So...

36:05.897 --> 36:07.966
So, take Joe...

36:07.999 --> 36:11.803
go to Croatia
for your father,

36:11.837 --> 36:13.939
while... I do that.

36:13.972 --> 36:15.707
You want us to
go without you?

36:15.741 --> 36:17.476
Yeah, I just...
You're his mother.

36:17.509 --> 36:20.612
I know that.
I know that.

36:23.982 --> 36:27.853
But I haven't been
a very good one...

36:27.886 --> 36:29.988
and I honestly
don't think I can be

36:30.021 --> 36:31.623
until I deal with this.

36:31.657 --> 36:32.758
Can't we do this together?

36:32.791 --> 36:34.326
This is how
we do it together.

36:34.360 --> 36:38.730
You have to help me
do it... alone.

36:46.938 --> 36:48.274
That's it?

36:51.277 --> 36:52.944
Is there anything else?

36:58.384 --> 37:00.586
What do you mean?

37:00.619 --> 37:03.622
That you want
to tell me.

37:06.692 --> 37:09.828
(sighs):
You know, I just...

37:09.861 --> 37:14.400
I was out of control,
I got...

37:14.433 --> 37:18.504
out of control, and I...

37:18.537 --> 37:21.607
I did some things.

37:21.640 --> 37:24.376
What kind of things?

37:24.410 --> 37:26.678
Things that I'm ashamed of.

37:26.712 --> 37:29.748
Okay, just tell me everything.

37:33.719 --> 37:36.322
Luka...

37:39.858 --> 37:41.693
After all this,
after everything,

37:41.727 --> 37:43.462
you don't want to tell me?

37:43.495 --> 37:46.798
Not tonight.

37:56.475 --> 37:58.744
(sighs, groans)

38:14.493 --> 38:15.861
It's my fault, isn't it?

38:15.894 --> 38:16.962
No, don't.

38:16.995 --> 38:18.564
Please don't.

38:18.597 --> 38:21.733
I... I should have
come home earlier.

38:21.767 --> 38:23.402
I shouldn't have
left you alone.

38:23.435 --> 38:24.970
No, I should have been
able to handle this.

38:25.003 --> 38:26.572
I broke my promise.

38:26.605 --> 38:28.106
Don't do that, okay?
Don't.

38:28.139 --> 38:29.875
I screwed up.

38:29.908 --> 38:32.644
I screwed up because I
couldn't keep it together.

38:32.678 --> 38:33.745
This is my fault.
I'm sorry.

38:33.779 --> 38:35.381
It's me.
I'm so sorry.

38:35.381 --> 38:38.083
And please, don't,
don't-- just don't.

38:43.855 --> 38:46.592
I'm sorry.

38:48.860 --> 38:50.862
(sighs)

38:52.798 --> 38:54.666
Hey.
Hey.

38:54.700 --> 38:56.768
Neurosurgery finished with
the driver from your MVC.

38:56.802 --> 38:58.437
He's waking up.

38:58.470 --> 38:59.771
Oh, that's good to know.

38:59.805 --> 39:01.973
Nice move in there.
You okay?

39:02.007 --> 39:03.475
Oh, yeah, I'm fine.

39:03.509 --> 39:04.943
You know, I did
a little cage fighting

39:04.976 --> 39:06.678
back in medical
school, so...

39:06.712 --> 39:08.046
It showed.

39:08.079 --> 39:09.581
Good thing Harold was in
there to save your ass.

39:09.615 --> 39:11.783
Is that what happened?

39:11.817 --> 39:14.886
Harold.

39:14.920 --> 39:16.622
Seriously...

39:16.655 --> 39:18.490
Thank you.

39:18.524 --> 39:20.859
And I don't care what
anybody says, Gates--

39:20.892 --> 39:22.794
I think you're
a half-decent guy.

39:22.828 --> 39:25.531
Sam!
Is that a new patient?

39:25.564 --> 39:27.899
No.
Damn.

39:30.636 --> 39:36.575
With 15 minutes to go,
the patient count is 263.

39:36.608 --> 39:38.710
I need
another two nurses here.

39:38.744 --> 39:42.047
Food poisoning at
the Christmas potluck.

39:45.116 --> 39:47.719
(men coughing,
retching)

39:47.753 --> 39:50.789
Hallelujah!

39:50.822 --> 39:52.824
All right, now take
a deep breath in...

39:52.858 --> 39:54.693
and blow it out.

39:54.726 --> 39:57.829
Good, good.

39:57.863 --> 40:01.767
(coughing)
Good.

40:01.800 --> 40:03.969
Hi, Mommy.

40:04.002 --> 40:07.606
Hi, baby.

40:07.639 --> 40:10.008
I love you.

40:10.041 --> 40:12.778
I love you, too.

40:16.948 --> 40:19.918
I couldn't forget him.

40:20.986 --> 40:23.555
I never knew how to tell you.

40:23.589 --> 40:27.158
Don't worry
about anything now.

40:27.192 --> 40:30.996
He's our son.

40:31.029 --> 40:34.132
I'll take care of him.

40:46.612 --> 40:48.213
Ah...!

40:48.246 --> 40:50.516
Ladies and gentlemen,

40:50.549 --> 40:54.185
the official census
for the past 24 hours

40:54.219 --> 40:57.188
stands at... 299.

40:57.222 --> 41:00.058
Triage is empty...

41:00.091 --> 41:01.893
which means
we will each be

41:01.927 --> 41:05.163
$100 richer in...

41:05.196 --> 41:07.999
ten... nine...

41:08.033 --> 41:10.101
eight...

41:10.135 --> 41:12.804
seven... six...

41:12.838 --> 41:14.740
five...

41:14.773 --> 41:19.210
four... three... two...

41:19.244 --> 41:21.680
Aah! Son of a bitch!

41:21.713 --> 41:24.082
(laughing):
Lily, make a chart for Frank.

41:24.115 --> 41:25.751
You have a serious gambling
problem, you know that?

41:25.784 --> 41:28.920
Three-view hand X-ray,
ibuprofen and an ice pack.

41:28.954 --> 41:32.858
Three hundred! Yes!

41:32.891 --> 41:35.727
Guys. Julia's ready.
We moved to Trauma Two.

41:37.729 --> 41:42.634
Water is the source of all life.

41:42.668 --> 41:45.303
It's used in healing rituals
all over the world,

41:45.336 --> 41:48.173
in almost every faith.

41:48.206 --> 41:54.112
Water is an element of
cleansing and purification.

41:54.145 --> 41:56.848
Today, we use
sterile saline.

41:56.882 --> 41:58.584
It's what we work with,

41:58.617 --> 42:01.587
and water doesn't get
much cleaner than that.

42:01.587 --> 42:06.658
Earlier, we talked about
what our patients do for us,

42:06.692 --> 42:11.129
how they affect us,
stay with us.

42:11.162 --> 42:12.598
Now we'll honor

42:12.598 --> 42:14.666
what we do for them,

42:14.700 --> 42:17.803
and pay thanks for the abilities
we've been given,

42:17.836 --> 42:20.706
hoping that we may
continue to use them

42:20.739 --> 42:22.107
to serve our
community.

42:22.140 --> 42:25.110
So let's each dip our
hands in the water.

42:25.143 --> 42:29.681
May we all have the
strength, dexterity,

42:29.715 --> 42:34.119
and sensitivity
to carry out the
mission of healing,

42:34.152 --> 42:36.788
and may our hands
be blessed.

42:40.058 --> 42:42.794
(train rumbling past)

43:22.233 --> 43:25.203
(engine starts)

43:35.046 --> 43:37.749
JULIA:
We have our dead,

43:37.783 --> 43:41.119
and we have let them go.

43:46.792 --> 43:49.761
Now let's
turn our attention back

43:49.795 --> 43:53.264
to the work of the living.
