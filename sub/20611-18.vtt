00:01.202 --> 00:04.338
[dramatic music]

00:04.372 --> 00:10.211
*

00:10.244 --> 00:12.646
- My name is Randall W. Turner.

00:12.680 --> 00:15.049
I've been making blades
for about 30 years,

00:15.083 --> 00:19.320
but I also make all kinds
of other utilitarian objects.

00:19.353 --> 00:21.622
I make handrails.
I make grave markers.

00:21.655 --> 00:24.358
I make squirrel roasters.

00:24.392 --> 00:26.494
I've never actually roasted
a squirrel with them,

00:26.527 --> 00:28.662
it's just sounds good.

00:28.696 --> 00:31.165
- My name is Dave Kato.
I spent four years

00:31.199 --> 00:33.234
in the Marine Corps,
and then 30 years

00:33.267 --> 00:34.802
as an air traffic controller.

00:34.835 --> 00:36.770
The most important
thing in my life

00:36.804 --> 00:39.540
is to crush my enemies,
to see them fly before me,

00:39.573 --> 00:41.375
and cure the lamentations
of their women.

00:41.409 --> 00:43.077
That, basically,
came from "Conan."

00:43.111 --> 00:44.345
That's a movie quote.

00:44.378 --> 00:46.147
- My name is Gabe Mabry.

00:46.180 --> 00:48.349
I split my time between
bladesmithing

00:48.382 --> 00:50.484
and teaching
at a state penitentiary.

00:50.518 --> 00:52.153
Even though I only have
three years' experience,

00:52.186 --> 00:53.721
I think I've done enough blades,

00:53.754 --> 00:56.224
I've put I the work,
and I'm excited

00:56.257 --> 00:59.160
at the underdog's chance
at winning.

00:59.193 --> 01:01.462
- My name is Joshua Fikentscher.

01:01.495 --> 01:02.863
As much as I like
to make blades,

01:02.896 --> 01:05.399
I also enjoy making
my own steel.

01:05.433 --> 01:08.636
The best way to describe
what I do is modern day alchemy.

01:08.669 --> 01:12.340
I take base metals
and I transform that

01:12.373 --> 01:16.810
to something
that's pointy and stabby.

01:16.844 --> 01:19.647
- Bladesmiths,
welcome to the Forge.

01:19.680 --> 01:21.682
You're here for three rounds
of edge weapon making

01:21.715 --> 01:24.485
competition designed to test
every aspect of your skills

01:24.518 --> 01:26.454
in front of our panel
of expert judges.

01:26.487 --> 01:28.356
Ultimately, these men decide
which of you will be

01:28.389 --> 01:30.158
the "Forged in Fire" Champion

01:30.191 --> 01:32.360
and leave here
with that check for ten grand.

01:32.393 --> 01:33.627
So let's meet them now.

01:33.661 --> 01:36.530
ABS Master Smith,
J. Neilson.

01:36.564 --> 01:38.566
Historic Weapons
Re-creation Specialist,

01:38.599 --> 01:40.268
David Baker.

01:40.301 --> 01:43.704
Edged Weapon Specialist,
Doug Marcaida.

01:43.737 --> 01:45.473
All right, gentlemen,
let's talk about

01:45.506 --> 01:47.308
the elephant in the room.

01:47.341 --> 01:49.610
Today, you'll be
making signature blades

01:49.643 --> 01:51.312
in your signature style,

01:51.345 --> 01:54.148
from this...

01:54.182 --> 01:56.650
[grunts]

01:56.684 --> 01:58.886
1971 Mercury Cougar.

01:58.919 --> 02:00.388
*

02:00.421 --> 02:01.755
- [bleep] me.

02:01.789 --> 02:03.157
Oh, my God, it's a car.

02:03.191 --> 02:05.493
[bleep].
[bleep] damn it.

02:05.526 --> 02:08.396
- This thing's rusted out.
Piece of junk.

02:08.429 --> 02:12.700
I'm really worried about making
a quality blade out of this.

02:12.733 --> 02:15.203
- Typically, this is
a four-hour challenge.

02:15.236 --> 02:17.438
However,
the judges and I believe

02:17.471 --> 02:18.906
we need to up the ante,

02:18.939 --> 02:22.310
so today,
you will only get three hours.

02:22.343 --> 02:23.844
Keep in mind
that in the second round

02:23.877 --> 02:25.479
you'll be putting handles
on your blades

02:25.513 --> 02:26.947
to turn them into
fully functional weapons

02:26.980 --> 02:28.749
that will then be tested
for strength

02:28.782 --> 02:31.619
and durability
in a muffler stab,

02:31.652 --> 02:34.655
and for edge retention
in a car mat slice.

02:34.688 --> 02:36.424
There will be
no design period

02:36.457 --> 02:39.193
during this first
round of competition.

02:39.227 --> 02:40.528
Good luck, bladesmiths.

02:40.561 --> 02:42.963
Your three hours starts...

02:42.996 --> 02:45.699
now.

02:45.733 --> 02:48.502
- Who's the first to check
the air in the tires.

02:48.536 --> 02:50.371
That's about how much
I know about cars.

02:50.404 --> 02:52.273
- Which metal would you
go for, J.?

02:52.306 --> 02:55.743
- The leaf springs.
It's good 5160 spring steel.

02:55.776 --> 02:58.846
It's thick. It's almost
in a bar stock form already.

02:58.879 --> 03:02.383
- You know that with a car
it's either springs or axels.

03:02.416 --> 03:05.319
In a car that old,
both of them are probably shot.

03:05.353 --> 03:08.356
Screw it.
Leaf Springs.

03:08.389 --> 03:10.258
We break up in groups of twos.

03:10.291 --> 03:13.294
- So it looks like Josh and Gabe
are working together

03:13.327 --> 03:15.629
to free up
those leaf springs.

03:15.663 --> 03:18.766
- I naturally gravitate
towards things that have curves,

03:18.799 --> 03:22.236
so I'm making a Persian
inspired Recurve Fighter.

03:22.270 --> 03:26.006
I have the personality
of a 36 grit belt sander

03:26.039 --> 03:28.909
'cause I am God
awfully aggressive as hell.

03:28.942 --> 03:31.745
Awesome.
I got my steel.

03:31.779 --> 03:33.547
Gabe can have
the rest to himself.

03:33.581 --> 03:35.583
- Gabe and Josh worked together,

03:35.616 --> 03:38.586
and Josh has actually
got his steel free.

03:38.619 --> 03:40.254
I think that's fairly
interesting

03:40.288 --> 03:42.556
considering how much help
he got from Gabe.

03:42.590 --> 03:44.258
- You didn't cut the U-bolts.

03:44.292 --> 03:45.993
- And he's just taken off
with his steel.

03:46.026 --> 03:48.662
- Yeah, Josh is
worried about Josh.

03:48.696 --> 03:50.698
- Josh bails on me.

03:50.731 --> 03:53.467
Uh...some friend you are.

03:53.501 --> 03:56.537
*

03:56.570 --> 03:59.673
I do not use
a lot of recycled steel.

03:59.707 --> 04:02.643
I like to use new steel
so that I know

04:02.676 --> 04:04.645
there's not gonna be any issues.

04:04.678 --> 04:06.447
My design for the blade

04:06.480 --> 04:10.351
is a fighter bowie hybrid
chef's knife.

04:10.384 --> 04:12.386
My friends and family think

04:12.420 --> 04:14.355
my bladesmithing career
is great,

04:14.388 --> 04:17.358
but my niece makes fun of me.

04:17.391 --> 04:19.593
Says I'm too cheap
to just buy a knife, so...

04:19.627 --> 04:21.629
[laughs]

04:21.662 --> 04:24.298
- At one time, I imagine,
this was a really nice car.

04:24.332 --> 04:25.999
It's not so nice anymore.
- Yeah,

04:26.033 --> 04:29.537
that day is past.
- The car smells like ass.

04:29.570 --> 04:33.374
I don't know if it had vagrants
living in it maybe, or mice?

04:33.407 --> 04:35.443
It just stinks to high heaven.

04:38.779 --> 04:41.014
- Want me to do it?
- If you can.

04:41.048 --> 04:44.518
- I've never taken springs off
of a car before,

04:44.552 --> 04:47.955
but I know that leaf springs
make excellent knives.

04:47.988 --> 04:50.391
- Dave and Randall having
a little bit of trouble

04:50.424 --> 04:52.993
with their leaf spring.
- Get another blade.

04:53.026 --> 04:56.497
I think I'll make
a straight edge seax.

04:56.530 --> 04:59.533
The design is good
for piercing and for cutting.

04:59.567 --> 05:01.402
Throughout the years
I've been making knives

05:01.435 --> 05:05.373
from almost exclusively used
hand hammers.

05:05.406 --> 05:09.377
So, when all else fails,
use a big hammer.

05:09.410 --> 05:11.412
- There we go.

05:11.445 --> 05:13.046
*

05:13.080 --> 05:14.382
- You got some?
You got what you want?

05:14.415 --> 05:16.850
- I believe so.

05:16.884 --> 05:20.421
- When one designs a blade,
one has a function in mind,

05:20.454 --> 05:22.790
so I'm going to make a slicer

05:22.823 --> 05:26.660
that should be able to cut
a car mat and pierce a muffler.

05:26.694 --> 05:28.696
I don't like
using recycled steel

05:28.729 --> 05:30.764
because
when I was first learning,

05:30.798 --> 05:32.065
I did some dumpster diving,

05:32.099 --> 05:34.535
and I pulled out a coil spring.

05:34.568 --> 05:37.538
I took it to my mentor
and he hit me in the head.

05:37.571 --> 05:39.440
He literally hit me
in the head and said,

05:39.473 --> 05:41.542
"Throw that away,
and don't ever do that again."

05:41.575 --> 05:45.479
- Dave didn't forge the tip in.
He cut a pre-formed tip.

05:45.513 --> 05:48.115
This is "Forged in Fire"
not chop sawed in fire.

05:48.148 --> 05:50.484
- This is not something
I would normally do,

05:50.518 --> 05:52.052
but the challenge is
what it is,

05:52.085 --> 05:54.388
and I will simply
have to make the best of it.

05:54.422 --> 05:56.590
- One hour has elapsed!

05:56.624 --> 05:59.993
You have just two hours
remaining to finish your work!

06:00.027 --> 06:02.863
*

06:02.896 --> 06:04.965
- The more I work the steel,

06:04.998 --> 06:08.101
the more I realize
that my design isn't working.

06:08.135 --> 06:11.405
Oh, [bleep].
Okay.

06:11.439 --> 06:13.073
It's got no recurve.

06:13.106 --> 06:15.042
- Josh kind of struggling
with his steel.

06:15.075 --> 06:16.744
- [bleep].

06:16.777 --> 06:19.413
- Josh seems to be upset
about the world.

06:19.447 --> 06:21.949
- Okay,
on the fly design change.

06:21.982 --> 06:23.551
I'm gonna give it
a nice front belly,

06:23.584 --> 06:25.986
and it's gonna look
really badass,

06:26.019 --> 06:28.456
and a nice big [bleep] slicer.

06:28.489 --> 06:31.959
- Those hammer blows from Big
Blue on his tang,

06:31.992 --> 06:33.727
it's alarming.

06:33.761 --> 06:36.497
- Josh's use of the Big Blue
is a little erratic.

06:36.530 --> 06:39.567
- And then over here, Randall
is just doing a great job.

06:39.600 --> 06:41.502
Look at that thing.

06:41.535 --> 06:44.037
- You know, I've had
anvils smaller than that hammer.

06:44.071 --> 06:47.107
Look at the size of that hammer.

06:47.140 --> 06:49.677
You know who else is moving
right along is Gabe.

06:49.710 --> 06:53.881
Gabe has already hammered a tip
into his bowie-esque design.

06:53.914 --> 06:57.985
- I have a generally forged
shape that I'm pleased with,

06:58.018 --> 07:00.988
and I put a false edge
at the tip.

07:01.021 --> 07:04.625
That might help
extra stabbiness.

07:04.658 --> 07:07.528
- Gabe, boy,
he can move some metal.

07:07.561 --> 07:10.498
That false edge he put in makes
for a great stabbing knife.

07:10.531 --> 07:12.500
- I would think
if I'm stabbing a muffler,

07:12.533 --> 07:15.669
I want something
that's more like a spear point.

07:15.703 --> 07:19.507
- Yup, because it needs
to penetrate and survive.

07:19.540 --> 07:21.975
*

07:22.009 --> 07:26.113
- I've got a rough profile,
so I'm going to the grinder

07:26.146 --> 07:30.518
because I've got to get
a good edge profile on my blade.

07:30.551 --> 07:32.219
- I'm enjoying watching Randall.

07:32.252 --> 07:34.622
He hammered that
blade down very thin.

07:34.655 --> 07:36.624
Very, very good hammer work.

07:36.657 --> 07:38.859
He's actually putting
a hollow grind in,

07:38.892 --> 07:40.561
which is a nice change of pace.

07:40.594 --> 07:41.995
- I'm not crazy about
how he's doing it,

07:42.029 --> 07:43.631
but I'm glad he's doing it.

07:43.664 --> 07:45.599
- Why?
- Well, I see these

07:45.633 --> 07:49.570
large sweeping motions
as opposed to slowing down,

07:49.603 --> 07:52.072
being precise
so you can actually see

07:52.105 --> 07:55.275
what the grinder's doing
to the surface.

07:55.308 --> 07:59.613
- Usually I grind very slowly,
but in this contest,

07:59.647 --> 08:00.948
I can't really do that.

08:00.981 --> 08:03.016
I've just got to try to hog away

08:03.050 --> 08:04.852
as much metal as I can

08:04.885 --> 08:10.190
and hope that
I don't make a mistake.

08:12.593 --> 08:14.061
*

08:14.094 --> 08:16.163
The grinder
is much more powerful

08:16.196 --> 08:22.035
than my main grinder,
and I cut way too deep.

08:22.069 --> 08:28.241
- Ah, no!

08:28.275 --> 08:31.612
- My blade is now uneven,
so that means

08:31.645 --> 08:35.048
I'm gonna have to cut off
a lot of the shape of my knife

08:35.082 --> 08:37.618
just to get it even,

08:37.651 --> 08:41.288
so I'm going to be
grinding some more,

08:41.321 --> 08:44.858
and some more, and some more,
and I'm losing time.

08:44.892 --> 08:46.960
- Randall's gone
to a flat flat.

08:46.994 --> 08:49.262
He's trying to fix
the unevenness of that blade.

08:49.296 --> 08:50.931
- It's getting thinner
and thinner every minute.

08:50.964 --> 08:53.667
- Yeah.
- Two hours has elapsed!

08:53.701 --> 08:57.571
You have just 60 minutes
remaining to finish your blades!

08:57.605 --> 08:59.272
- Thank you!

08:59.306 --> 09:01.675
- Dave's been on the grinder
for a second,

09:01.709 --> 09:05.312
and his blade's really starting
to take on a shape.

09:05.345 --> 09:09.182
- Some people find
bladesmithing therapeutic.

09:09.216 --> 09:12.152
I don't.
It doesn't make me better.

09:12.185 --> 09:14.588
Actually, it makes me worse
because I'll throw stuff

09:14.622 --> 09:17.090
and yell at the dog.

09:17.124 --> 09:19.593
I can feel myself
getting a little frustrated

09:19.627 --> 09:22.596
because the grinder's not going
as quickly as I would like,

09:22.630 --> 09:24.364
so I have to get
a little more aggressive

09:24.397 --> 09:27.100
with the belts
even though I don't want to.

09:27.134 --> 09:31.204
- Oh-oh.
- Dave, you all right.

09:31.238 --> 09:33.340
- He's giving you the stink eye.

09:33.373 --> 09:37.344
- I have a resting bitch face,
but I'm really not unpleasant.

09:37.377 --> 09:39.647
*

09:39.680 --> 09:42.149
- What is with that weird hump
on the back of that blade?

09:42.182 --> 09:44.317
- Josh ground
a lot of shape into it.

09:44.351 --> 09:46.920
I just don't understand
having that extreme sweep

09:46.954 --> 09:49.056
in a stabbing test.

09:49.089 --> 09:53.060
*

09:53.093 --> 09:55.729
- Okay.

09:55.763 --> 09:57.631
I have 40 minutes
left to play with this?

09:57.665 --> 10:00.200
I'm happy as a pig in a blanket.

10:00.233 --> 10:01.869
Gosh, did I just actually
say pig in a blanket?

10:01.902 --> 10:03.103
I'm pretty sure I just did.

10:03.136 --> 10:07.875
*

10:07.908 --> 10:10.243
Ah, listen to that.

10:10.277 --> 10:14.314
Yes, yes!
Okay, I have a hardened blade.

10:14.347 --> 10:16.416
- I file test my blade
several times

10:16.449 --> 10:18.085
because I'm paranoid
about it being hard.

10:18.118 --> 10:19.653
[chuckles]

10:19.687 --> 10:21.021
- Oh, I like it, man.

10:21.054 --> 10:23.423
- It's not as scimitary
as yours is.

10:23.456 --> 10:26.093
*

10:26.126 --> 10:28.796
- I'm pleased
with my blade shape.

10:28.829 --> 10:31.799
Now, what I'm concerned most
about is the heat treatment.

10:31.832 --> 10:33.901
If you don't have
a temperature controlled kiln,

10:33.934 --> 10:37.104
you have to eyeball it,
but I'm in a bright forge.

10:37.137 --> 10:39.239
I can't see
the transformation shadows

10:39.272 --> 10:40.774
that'll tell me
it's time to quench,

10:40.808 --> 10:43.977
so I have to guess.

10:44.011 --> 10:46.246
- There you go.
Dave just quenched.

10:46.279 --> 10:47.380
- He's counting.
- He's counting it out.

10:47.414 --> 10:49.016
There you go.

10:49.049 --> 10:54.922
*

10:54.955 --> 10:56.289
- It's not as hard
as I like.

10:56.323 --> 10:59.927
[bleep].
I failed in the first attempt.

10:59.960 --> 11:04.965
I still have time, so I'm going
to repeat the process.

11:04.998 --> 11:06.934
- Randall does not look happy.

11:06.967 --> 11:10.337
His blade has gotten
very, very thin.

11:10.370 --> 11:13.240
- I really don't like
the shape of the blade.

11:13.273 --> 11:15.108
The edge geometry
is a little off

11:15.142 --> 11:17.377
because of my grinding mistakes.

11:17.410 --> 11:18.846
- I'd like to see him
quench before

11:18.879 --> 11:21.081
there's not much of
that blade left.

11:21.114 --> 11:25.185
- I'm always the most nervous
getting ready for the quench.

11:25.218 --> 11:27.054
- Randall, man,
I just don't know

11:27.087 --> 11:28.922
what he's shaking his head
about at this point.

11:28.956 --> 11:30.791
- Well, he's thermos-cycling
the blade, obviously.

11:30.824 --> 11:32.259
He's just not happy
with those grinds.

11:32.292 --> 11:36.396
*

11:36.429 --> 11:39.032
- Ten, nine, eight,

11:39.066 --> 11:42.202
seven, six, five,

11:42.235 --> 11:44.972
four, three, two,

11:45.005 --> 11:47.741
one, bladesmiths,
shut down your machines.

11:47.775 --> 11:51.111
Drop your tools.
This round is over.

11:51.144 --> 11:54.514
- I feel happy that I didn't
screw up majorly.

11:54.547 --> 11:56.383
I've done about
as good as I can,

11:56.416 --> 12:00.020
and I feel confident
that it's not a potato,

12:00.053 --> 12:02.355
which is what I'm going for.

12:02.389 --> 12:04.224
*

12:04.257 --> 12:06.259
- Bladesmiths,
in just three short hours,

12:06.293 --> 12:08.862
each of you has salvaged steel
from a junk car

12:08.896 --> 12:11.865
to forge signature blades
in your signature style.

12:11.899 --> 12:13.533
Now it's time for the judges
to take a closer look

12:13.566 --> 12:16.837
at your work.
Josh, you're up first.

12:16.870 --> 12:19.206
*

12:19.239 --> 12:21.374
- I like the dimensions
of your blade.

12:21.408 --> 12:23.343
That curve is really pretty,

12:23.376 --> 12:26.479
though having that
trailing point for a stab test

12:26.513 --> 12:28.849
could be something
that gets in the way.

12:28.882 --> 12:31.251
There is a warp in your blade.

12:31.284 --> 12:34.154
It's like that spring decided
it wanted to be a spring again.

12:34.187 --> 12:35.823
- Gabe, you're up.

12:35.856 --> 12:37.524
Please present your work
to the judges.

12:37.557 --> 12:39.927
*

12:39.960 --> 12:42.029
- Gabe, I like the shape
of your blade.

12:42.062 --> 12:44.865
You've got that false edge in
there to help with penetration.

12:44.898 --> 12:47.000
You're a bit
on the lean side,

12:47.034 --> 12:50.003
but it doesn't need to be
a big boat anchor to be strong.

12:50.037 --> 12:52.539
- All right, Dave, please
present your work to the judges.

12:52.572 --> 12:55.275
*

12:55.308 --> 12:58.912
- Well, Dave,
your blade is very straight.

12:58.946 --> 13:01.414
It's clean work,
but the issue

13:01.448 --> 13:04.084
I have with your design
is your tip.

13:04.117 --> 13:07.187
We are doing
a thrusting test on this.

13:07.220 --> 13:09.489
That's pretty much as far
as you're gonna go in.

13:09.522 --> 13:11.158
the rest of that's
gonna be stopped by

13:11.191 --> 13:13.026
how stout your blade is.

13:13.060 --> 13:15.395
If this moves forward,
I hope you fix the angle

13:15.428 --> 13:18.365
of your tip.
- Randall, you're up.

13:18.398 --> 13:20.133
Please present your work
to the judges.

13:20.167 --> 13:22.535
*

13:22.569 --> 13:24.404
- Randall,
your forging technique

13:24.437 --> 13:26.473
on drawing this blade out
was textbook.

13:26.506 --> 13:27.607
Pleasure to watch that.

13:27.640 --> 13:30.010
When you got to the grinder,

13:30.043 --> 13:31.945
I was really hoping
you were going to put

13:31.979 --> 13:33.881
a large hollow grind on this,

13:33.914 --> 13:35.883
it would have given it
a razor edge

13:35.916 --> 13:37.885
with the support
of a thick spine,

13:37.918 --> 13:40.020
but then you started
flattening it out.

13:40.053 --> 13:43.556
It crushed me.
[laughs]

13:43.590 --> 13:48.228
- Your edge is out of alignment,
and this knife is thinned out.

13:48.261 --> 13:52.099
I mean, it's been on Nutrisystem
for about six months now.

13:52.132 --> 13:54.234
- All right, bladesmiths,
while the judges go

13:54.267 --> 13:55.969
into deliberation,
I'm gonna have you leave

13:56.003 --> 13:57.537
your blades here,
and please step off

13:57.570 --> 13:59.572
the Forge floor.

13:59.606 --> 14:03.543
*

14:03.576 --> 14:05.578
- Well, that sucks.

14:05.612 --> 14:07.881
- It'll be fun they said.

14:07.915 --> 14:10.884
- All right, judges, is there
a bladesmith whose work

14:10.918 --> 14:12.285
in the first round puts him

14:12.319 --> 14:14.221
automatically
into that second round?

14:14.254 --> 14:15.889
- Yeah.
- Yes.

14:15.923 --> 14:16.990
- Which one was that
do you think?

14:17.024 --> 14:18.425
- That would be Gabe's.

14:18.458 --> 14:22.129
- All right,
let's move on to Dave.

14:22.162 --> 14:25.032
- As far as the forging goes,
I think he did the minimum,

14:25.065 --> 14:28.468
and that tip is so rounded.

14:28.501 --> 14:31.104
It's not shaped for stabbing.

14:31.138 --> 14:33.473
- This doesn't even have
bevel's ground in.

14:33.506 --> 14:36.609
There's easily an eighth
of an inch, if not more here

14:36.643 --> 14:38.912
that hasn't even been
touched yet,

14:38.946 --> 14:42.049
so there's several issues.

14:42.082 --> 14:43.951
- All right, let's move on
to Josh's blade.

14:43.984 --> 14:45.585
*

14:45.618 --> 14:47.955
- This particular weapon
is made to slash

14:47.988 --> 14:49.289
sideways or diagonally.

14:49.322 --> 14:51.091
It's not meant for stabbing.

14:51.124 --> 14:54.694
The spine is not in line
with the force behind it,

14:54.727 --> 14:56.396
so that could be an issue.

14:56.429 --> 15:00.033
There is a warp here
significant enough

15:00.067 --> 15:02.602
to see it not even go flat
on the table.

15:02.635 --> 15:05.438
- I really just want to hear
what they're saying.

15:05.472 --> 15:08.375
- Let's move on to our last
bladesmith, Randall.

15:08.408 --> 15:09.642
*

15:09.676 --> 15:11.578
- This one kills me.

15:11.611 --> 15:15.615
It looked like a classic seax
when he forged this out.

15:15.648 --> 15:17.684
Once he got on the grinder,

15:17.717 --> 15:21.154
it went from being a seax
to being disappointing.

15:21.188 --> 15:23.123
- His plunge grinds are way off,

15:23.156 --> 15:26.259
and the other big issue
is his edge.

15:26.293 --> 15:28.228
It's thinner here
than it is up here.

15:28.261 --> 15:30.197
- Yeah.
- And I really don't think

15:30.230 --> 15:33.000
there's enough meat left
to be able to fix that problem.

15:33.033 --> 15:35.002
It's too thin.

15:35.035 --> 15:36.970
- All right, judges,
Doug, have you made

15:37.004 --> 15:38.271
your final decision?
- Yes, I have.

15:38.305 --> 15:39.672
- Dave?
- Yeah.

15:39.706 --> 15:41.241
- J.?
- Oh, yeah.

15:41.274 --> 15:42.442
- All right,
let's go tell our smiths.

15:42.475 --> 15:47.180
*

15:47.214 --> 15:49.316
- Bladesmiths,
the judges have completed

15:49.349 --> 15:51.251
their deliberation,
and it's time for one of you

15:51.284 --> 15:53.586
to leave the Forge.

15:53.620 --> 15:57.124
*

15:57.157 --> 16:00.627
Randall, your blade
did not make the cut.

16:00.660 --> 16:04.464
- Randall, your forging skills
impressed all of us up here.

16:04.497 --> 16:06.766
You pretty much forged
your b into shape.

16:06.799 --> 16:10.203
But when you got to the grinder,
it cost you so much material,

16:10.237 --> 16:13.106
and with grinders,
there's no going back.

16:13.140 --> 16:15.342
Your edge is uneven,
and the only way

16:15.375 --> 16:17.477
to fix that
is by grinding even more,

16:17.510 --> 16:20.180
and there's just not enough
material here to do that.

16:20.213 --> 16:23.083
And for that reason,
we're letting you go.

16:23.116 --> 16:25.218
- Randall, please
surrender your blade.

16:25.252 --> 16:26.686
*

16:26.719 --> 16:28.621
- I kind of knew
this was coming.

16:28.655 --> 16:31.458
The mistakes
I made during the challenge

16:31.491 --> 16:34.127
threw me to the bottom
of the heap.

16:34.161 --> 16:37.664
It's a little disappointing,
but I gave it my best shot.

16:37.697 --> 16:41.134
Probably my best advice
to the other bladesmiths...

16:41.168 --> 16:44.237
try to avoid making mistakes.
[laughs]

16:44.271 --> 16:48.375
*

16:48.408 --> 16:52.145
- Bladesmiths, congratulations,
you made it to the second round.

16:52.179 --> 16:54.114
Now that your blades
have been tempered,

16:54.147 --> 16:55.482
it's time to turn them
into fully functional weapons

16:55.515 --> 16:57.750
by attaching handles to them.

16:57.784 --> 17:00.520
When the time runs out,
your weapons will be tested

17:00.553 --> 17:04.291
for strength and durability
in the muffler stab,

17:04.324 --> 17:07.660
and for edge retention
in a car mat slice.

17:07.694 --> 17:13.366
However, due to the fact
that we're stabbing a muffler,

17:13.400 --> 17:17.837
you must incorporate a guard
into your blade's design.

17:17.870 --> 17:20.140
You will have three hours
in this round.

17:20.173 --> 17:22.675
Now, you can use that time
to address flaws and issues

17:22.709 --> 17:25.078
that were identified
in your blades.

17:25.112 --> 17:26.513
Good luck, bladesmiths.

17:26.546 --> 17:28.281
Your time starts...

17:28.315 --> 17:29.849
now.

17:29.882 --> 17:33.286
We have three bladesmiths
that have to, now,

17:33.320 --> 17:36.089
put guards on blades
that they hadn't planned on

17:36.123 --> 17:37.257
putting guards on.

17:37.290 --> 17:38.758
- Surprise.

17:38.791 --> 17:41.394
Incorporate a guard
to the design.

17:41.428 --> 17:42.862
- This is something
I've not seen

17:42.895 --> 17:44.831
the bladesmiths
do in a round 2,

17:44.864 --> 17:46.866
like grab some paper and start
drawing out some designs.

17:46.899 --> 17:49.269
- Yeah, that's called
"Oh, crap paper."

17:49.302 --> 17:50.403
*

17:50.437 --> 17:52.305
- I do not typically

17:52.339 --> 17:54.274
make blades with a guard

17:54.307 --> 17:55.575
'cause I make
kitchen knives, so...

17:55.608 --> 17:57.410
[laughs]

17:57.444 --> 17:59.112
So I decide
I'm gonna do a U-guard.

17:59.146 --> 18:01.314
I figured that would be
the easiest.

18:01.348 --> 18:03.850
My weld's not pretty,
but hopefully, she'll hold.

18:03.883 --> 18:07.654
*

18:07.687 --> 18:10.557
- In Round 2, I have
this additional challenge.

18:10.590 --> 18:13.593
I need to correct the issues
that the judges identified.

18:13.626 --> 18:16.596
- Dave needs to
reprofile his tip,

18:16.629 --> 18:18.465
add a guard, add a handle,

18:18.498 --> 18:19.899
and put an edge on that blade.

18:19.932 --> 18:21.401
- Basically,
he's got to make a knife.

18:21.434 --> 18:23.336
- He's got to make a knife.
[laughs]

18:23.370 --> 18:25.772
- I need to thin up
and drop the point a little bit

18:25.805 --> 18:28.508
so it will penetrate metal.

18:28.541 --> 18:30.843
It's time for
some thrilling heroics.

18:30.877 --> 18:32.845
*

18:32.879 --> 18:35.848
- I have a pretty bad warp,
and the judges

18:35.882 --> 18:37.684
didn't like the design
of my blade

18:37.717 --> 18:39.619
for the muffler stab,

18:39.652 --> 18:41.721
but I don't have time
to fix both,

18:41.754 --> 18:45.558
so I'm not gonna worry
about the stylistic issues.

18:45.592 --> 18:48.861
What I'm really concerned
about is fixing the warp.

18:48.895 --> 18:51.398
I just hope
this isn't a bad idea.

18:51.431 --> 18:55.268
- You have two hours
remaining to finish your work.

18:55.302 --> 18:57.204
- The most important thing
is to have a nice,

18:57.237 --> 19:00.340
secure handle so nothing
comes flying apart

19:00.373 --> 19:03.676
during the testing,
so I'm using G-10,

19:03.710 --> 19:06.413
but I realize there's a gap

19:06.446 --> 19:07.614
between the handle material
and the guard.

19:07.647 --> 19:09.916
*

19:09.949 --> 19:13.186
So now I get to find a spacer
to throw in.

19:14.754 --> 19:16.789
The general thickness
of the spacer

19:16.823 --> 19:19.359
that I need and the
glow-in-the-dark stuff

19:19.392 --> 19:21.794
seems to be about
the right size.

19:21.828 --> 19:26.699
Turn the lights off.
Let's look at my blade.

19:26.733 --> 19:29.236
- I think I addressed
all the issues.

19:29.269 --> 19:31.504
I've got a good, strong point.

19:31.538 --> 19:34.207
Now I have to put a guard on it.

19:34.241 --> 19:36.743
Unfortunately, the band saw
doesn't seem to be

19:36.776 --> 19:39.712
tracking properly.
I can't get an accurate cut.

19:39.746 --> 19:41.548
No time to fix that.

19:41.581 --> 19:43.516
I have to start filing
the slot by hand.

19:43.550 --> 19:46.453
*

19:46.486 --> 19:47.787
My arms are burning.

19:47.820 --> 19:50.557
My muscles ache.
I'm 62!

19:50.590 --> 19:52.625
- Dave looked over here and it
looked like he wanted to hit

19:52.659 --> 19:54.594
some of us with a file.

19:54.627 --> 19:56.796
- It looks like the notch is
only about a quarter inch deep.

19:56.829 --> 19:59.232
- It's got to get all
the way to the spine.

19:59.266 --> 20:01.468
- I'm worried about
running out of steam,

20:01.501 --> 20:04.537
but I got to get it done,
and I simply can't quit.

20:04.571 --> 20:06.706
"Goonies Never Say Die."

20:06.739 --> 20:08.608
*

20:08.641 --> 20:10.877
- I've gotten
the warp mostly out.

20:10.910 --> 20:13.546
Now, it's time for me
to attack the guard.

20:13.580 --> 20:16.949
There is no good way
in a really crazy time crunch

20:16.983 --> 20:20.553
to fit a good,
decent guard.

20:20.587 --> 20:23.756
I have this piece of what
I think is mild steel,

20:23.790 --> 20:27.927
and I can't get through it.

20:27.960 --> 20:29.762
There's a famous saying that
"No battle plan survives

20:29.796 --> 20:31.298
first contact with the enemy."

20:31.331 --> 20:32.899
*

20:32.932 --> 20:34.367
Plan B,
I'll cut it with the porta-band.

20:34.401 --> 20:36.436
[whirring]

20:36.469 --> 20:38.538
[bleep].

20:38.571 --> 20:40.840
- I don't know if Josh knows
how to use that porta-band now.

20:40.873 --> 20:43.810
- Well,
we'll find out shortly.

20:43.843 --> 20:48.615
- Crap.
I can't get through this either.

20:48.648 --> 20:50.650
- Ai yai yai.

20:50.683 --> 20:52.552
- Well, that sucks.

20:52.585 --> 20:55.522
Okay, plan C.
I'll take the brass.

20:55.555 --> 20:59.326
- So Josh has grabbed
a bar of brass.

20:59.359 --> 21:00.793
- He's gonna find something
that'll work eventually.

21:00.827 --> 21:03.896
- [bleep].
Nothing is working.

21:03.930 --> 21:05.532
*

21:05.565 --> 21:07.066
If I turn in a blade

21:07.099 --> 21:08.901
that does not have
a guard on it,

21:08.935 --> 21:10.837
I am going home.

21:10.870 --> 21:12.339
- This guy's gonna lose
a finger.

21:12.372 --> 21:13.773
I can't watch this.

21:13.806 --> 21:15.274
- [bleep].

21:18.110 --> 21:20.347
The definition of idiocy
is doing the same thing
*

21:20.380 --> 21:22.349
over and over again
and expecting different results.

21:22.382 --> 21:24.351
[bleep].

21:24.384 --> 21:26.786
I know,
hands down, the one material

21:26.819 --> 21:30.490
that I can definitely drill
through is plastic.

21:30.523 --> 21:32.392
- Is he trying to do
a plastic guard?

21:32.425 --> 21:35.595
- Easy.
- Easy peasy.

21:35.628 --> 21:38.431
- You don't think that's good,
a plastic guard?

21:38.465 --> 21:40.867
My toy knives have them.

21:40.900 --> 21:43.903
- But it's probably the crappies
material that I could choose,

21:43.936 --> 21:47.374
but at least I'll have a guard.

21:47.407 --> 21:51.578
- You have just
60 minutes remaining!

21:51.611 --> 21:55.081
- The guard cost me an hour
that I didn't anticipate.

21:55.114 --> 21:58.351
Thank goodness my slab handle
grinds quite easily,

21:58.385 --> 22:00.520
but it looks like
something a baby

22:00.553 --> 22:04.991
excreted after a dinner
of creamed corn.

22:05.024 --> 22:07.093
I'm afraid I'm not gonna
get this thing done in time,

22:07.126 --> 22:10.697
but that is
a self-defeating circuit,

22:10.730 --> 22:12.765
so I have to put the clock
out of my mind

22:12.799 --> 22:17.370
and just do the job.

22:17.404 --> 22:19.639
- My handle
looks really good, I think.

22:19.672 --> 22:21.874
You know,
I need to get this sharpened.

22:21.908 --> 22:25.111
- Gabe's blade looks
quite the shiny piece.

22:25.144 --> 22:26.679
- I ink I can win
"Forged in Fire"

22:26.713 --> 22:29.516
because of my even keel nature.

22:29.549 --> 22:31.584
I stay calm, cool,
and collected.

22:31.618 --> 22:33.520
- We got hair shaving.
- Oh, good, good.

22:33.553 --> 22:34.787
- We have a lot of hair,
actually.

22:34.821 --> 22:37.390
- My blade is scary sharp.

22:37.424 --> 22:39.526
- Oh, shaved off mole.

22:39.559 --> 22:41.828
- The boo-boo brigade
is on the floor.

22:41.861 --> 22:43.696
- I'll take a Band-Aid, I guess.
- Sure.

22:43.730 --> 22:44.997
*

22:45.031 --> 22:46.866
- I've spent way more time

22:46.899 --> 22:49.035
than I should have
working on my guard.

22:49.068 --> 22:52.004
Now I have to focus on
getting the handle right,

22:52.038 --> 22:55.608
but there's gaps between

22:55.642 --> 22:59.412
my plastic handles
and my guard.

22:59.446 --> 23:02.749
The best way to fill up
the gaps is with epoxy.

23:02.782 --> 23:05.885
My handle's blue.
I'll mix up blue epoxy.

23:05.918 --> 23:07.620
No one will ever notice.

23:07.654 --> 23:10.490
*

23:10.523 --> 23:13.426
- Ten, nine, eight,

23:13.460 --> 23:15.795
seven, six, five,

23:15.828 --> 23:17.864
four, three,

23:17.897 --> 23:19.866
two, one.

23:19.899 --> 23:21.901
Bladesmiths, drop your tools,
secure your blades,

23:21.934 --> 23:23.436
and return to your anvils.

23:23.470 --> 23:24.871
This round is over.

23:24.904 --> 23:26.038
*

23:26.072 --> 23:27.674
- My blade is finished.

23:27.707 --> 23:29.942
It's got a guard on it,

23:29.976 --> 23:33.112
but I wasn't able to address
everything that the judges said.

23:33.145 --> 23:36.616
I hope that won't send me home.

23:36.649 --> 23:38.551
- Smiths, welcome to our
strength test,

23:38.585 --> 23:40.920
the muffler stab.

23:40.953 --> 23:43.155
This is gonna be painful.

23:43.189 --> 23:45.024
I'm gonna take
each of your blades,

23:45.057 --> 23:47.026
and I'm gonna stab,
quite violently,

23:47.059 --> 23:50.162
into these steel
mufflers three times.

23:50.196 --> 23:51.798
I'm not concerned
about what your knives

23:51.831 --> 23:53.533
do to these mufflers,

23:53.566 --> 23:54.701
I want to see
what these mufflers

23:54.734 --> 23:56.569
are gonna do to your knives.

23:56.603 --> 23:58.137
Dave, what do you think?

23:58.170 --> 24:00.039
- I'm ready, sir.
- Let's have some fun.

24:00.072 --> 24:02.609
*

24:02.642 --> 24:04.143
- I'm so nervous right now.

24:04.176 --> 24:06.779
Did I change
the geometry enough?

24:06.813 --> 24:08.214
Is it going to pierce
the muffler?

24:08.247 --> 24:09.682
I just don't know.

24:09.716 --> 24:13.052
*

24:13.085 --> 24:16.489
I wish I had worn
my brown pants today.

24:16.523 --> 24:23.462
*

24:26.999 --> 24:29.101
- Well, Dave,
everything stayed tight.

24:29.135 --> 24:31.671
Nothing's knocked
out of alignment.

24:31.704 --> 24:33.840
The handle
was actually comfortable,

24:33.873 --> 24:37.043
but we definitely got
a lot of roll right here.

24:37.076 --> 24:40.246
It's not on the very tip.
It's about half an inch back.

24:40.279 --> 24:43.015
That is a concern.

24:43.049 --> 24:44.717
Gabe, how you feeling?

24:44.751 --> 24:46.719
- Go nuts, man.
- Oh, don't tell me that.

24:46.753 --> 24:48.087
[laughs]

24:48.120 --> 24:55.027
*

25:08.741 --> 25:11.043
Well, Gabe,
it punctured well,

25:11.077 --> 25:13.212
but you did lose some edge
up here on the tip.

25:13.245 --> 25:15.081
I can catch it with my thumb,

25:15.114 --> 25:16.849
so it's definitely rolled over,

25:16.883 --> 25:19.752
but overall,
it did very well on the test.

25:19.786 --> 25:23.189
- Thank you.
- Josh, you ready?

25:23.222 --> 25:25.257
- As ready as I'll ever be.
- All right.

25:25.291 --> 25:27.794
*

25:27.827 --> 25:29.328
- The stab test is
the most difficult test

25:29.361 --> 25:31.130
for my blade design.

25:31.163 --> 25:32.965
I'm hoping they
can puncture through.

25:32.999 --> 25:39.939
*

25:48.380 --> 25:53.620
- Well, Josh, the design
is not meant for this test,

25:53.653 --> 25:56.155
and that was never addressed.

25:56.188 --> 25:58.290
I can't stab
straight down with this.

25:58.324 --> 26:01.027
I have to stab at an angle
to get that point in

26:01.060 --> 26:03.730
because the tip is coming up.

26:03.763 --> 26:06.666
You did have a warp
going down your blade.

26:06.699 --> 26:09.268
It did, actually,
bend a little bit more.

26:09.301 --> 26:12.872
But overall,
it did survive the test,

26:12.905 --> 26:14.941
and it did stay together,
so good job.

26:14.974 --> 26:16.943
- I feel disheartened.

26:16.976 --> 26:19.311
However, my blade survived
through the test,

26:19.345 --> 26:22.982
and I should excel
in the slice test

26:23.015 --> 26:26.085
so long as my blade
is sharp enough.

26:26.118 --> 26:29.155
- Bladesmiths,
in keeping with the car theme,

26:29.188 --> 26:31.658
I will take your blades
and test its sharpness

26:31.691 --> 26:34.093
by slashing through
these car mats.

26:34.126 --> 26:35.361
Dave, you're up first.
You ready?

26:35.394 --> 26:36.963
- Yes, sir.
- Let's do this.

26:36.996 --> 26:43.870
*

26:48.841 --> 26:50.242
- Nice.

26:50.276 --> 26:52.211
- Wow.

26:52.244 --> 26:55.314
- All right, Dave,
despite being a stouter blade,

26:55.347 --> 26:58.785
your edge is fine enough
and sharp enough

26:58.818 --> 27:01.053
to lacerate through the car mat.

27:01.087 --> 27:04.190
Overall, sir,
your blade's edge will cut.

27:04.223 --> 27:06.659
- Thank you.
- Good job.

27:06.693 --> 27:08.094
Gabe, your turn.
Are you ready?

27:08.127 --> 27:09.862
- I'm ready. Go nuts.
- Let's do this.

27:09.896 --> 27:16.836
*

27:24.210 --> 27:27.313
This feels good in the hand.

27:27.346 --> 27:29.181
When I slash with this thing

27:29.215 --> 27:33.019
I barely felt
any kind of resistance at all.

27:33.052 --> 27:36.723
Your blade, sir, will cut.
Good job.

27:36.756 --> 27:38.257
- Thank you.
- Josh, your turn.

27:38.290 --> 27:39.892
You ready?

27:39.926 --> 27:40.893
Let's do this.

27:40.927 --> 27:45.264
*

27:45.297 --> 27:47.033
- It would have - It woulf

27:47.066 --> 27:48.367
somebody's blade
didn't cut through.

27:48.400 --> 27:50.803
Both of them sliced
right through.

27:50.837 --> 27:52.304
It makes it tougher for me.

27:52.338 --> 27:59.278
*

28:03.750 --> 28:06.919
- Well, Josh, you definitely
have a slashing profile

28:06.953 --> 28:08.354
to your blade.

28:08.387 --> 28:10.189
The way you have
your edge allows me

28:10.222 --> 28:13.492
to lacerate with no resistance.

28:13.525 --> 28:17.496
Your handle, it is a little bit
on the spindly side.

28:17.529 --> 28:20.132
If I continued more cuts, you
can tell it's probably the type

28:20.166 --> 28:22.401
that would start
to rotate on me,

28:22.434 --> 28:24.436
but, your blade will cut.

28:24.470 --> 28:28.140
- Thank you.

28:28.174 --> 28:30.242
- Bladesmiths,
the judges have completed

28:30.276 --> 28:32.845
their deliberation, and they've
made the final decision.

28:32.879 --> 28:35.181
It's time for one of you smiths
to leave the Forge.

28:35.214 --> 28:39.485
*

28:39.518 --> 28:43.455
Josh, your blade
did not make the cut.

28:43.489 --> 28:45.992
- You know, Josh, the strength
test is what really hurt you.

28:46.025 --> 28:47.994
The curve of that blade
made stabbing

28:48.027 --> 28:49.128
into that steel
a real hindrance,

28:49.161 --> 28:51.063
plus you already had a warp

28:51.097 --> 28:52.799
and you actually picked up
more of a bend

28:52.832 --> 28:54.366
in the strength test,
so those are the reasons

28:54.400 --> 28:56.435
we're gonna let you go.

28:56.468 --> 28:59.772
- Josh, please
surrender your blade.

28:59.806 --> 29:01.273
- I feel
a little bit disappointed.

29:01.307 --> 29:03.876
Obviously,
I didn't bring my A game,

29:03.910 --> 29:05.978
but even though I didn't win,

29:06.012 --> 29:09.448
there's things that I've learned
about how I make choices,

29:09.481 --> 29:11.884
about how I act under pressure,

29:11.918 --> 29:14.987
and that,
in and of itself, is a win.

29:15.021 --> 29:18.457
*

29:18.490 --> 29:20.559
- Dave, Gabe,
congratulations.

29:20.592 --> 29:23.229
You've made it into the final
round of this competition.

29:23.262 --> 29:24.897
Now, we're sending you back
to your home forge

29:24.931 --> 29:26.265
to recreate an iconic weapon

29:26.298 --> 29:30.236
from history:

29:30.269 --> 29:31.537
the yatagan.

29:31.570 --> 29:34.173
*

29:34.206 --> 29:37.209
The yatagan was prominently
used by elite infantry soldiers

29:37.243 --> 29:40.212
in Ottoman Turkey
from the 16th to 19th centuries.

29:40.246 --> 29:41.948
Revered for
its extreme light weight

29:41.981 --> 29:43.482
and lethal forward curve,

29:43.515 --> 29:45.952
it was a quick
and deadly slicer,

29:45.985 --> 29:49.188
while it's strong, tapered tip
made it a powerful thruster.

29:49.221 --> 29:51.357
It also featured a unique,
yet practical pommel

29:51.390 --> 29:53.359
that contained flared out ears

29:53.392 --> 29:55.862
to prevent it from slipping
from the hand in battle.

29:55.895 --> 29:58.397
A fierce and respected weapon,
the yatagan was most notably

29:58.430 --> 30:00.432
wielded by Suleiman
the Magnificent,

30:00.466 --> 30:03.602
the longest reigning sultan
of the Ottoman Empire.

30:03.635 --> 30:06.372
Your yatagan
must include a forward

30:06.405 --> 30:08.875
drop at the point,
a bolster,

30:08.908 --> 30:10.342
and a double eared pommel.

30:10.376 --> 30:13.579
- The handle has these
flared ears,

30:13.612 --> 30:17.216
something that does not
resemble anything

30:17.249 --> 30:19.118
that I have ever made before.

30:19.151 --> 30:20.452
- You will have five days
at your home forge

30:20.486 --> 30:22.354
to complete this challenge.

30:22.388 --> 30:24.190
After five days, you will return
to present your weapons

30:24.223 --> 30:26.258
to our panel of expert judges.

30:26.292 --> 30:29.261
Only after they've tested them
and inspected your work,

30:29.295 --> 30:31.563
will they declare one of you
the "Forged in Fire" Champion

30:31.597 --> 30:34.400
who also leaves with
that check for ten grand.

30:34.433 --> 30:37.203
Good luck, bladesmiths.
We'll see you in five days.

30:37.236 --> 30:38.170
- Good luck.

30:38.204 --> 30:41.607
*

30:41.640 --> 30:44.076
- I've been assigned
to make a yatagan.

30:44.110 --> 30:45.978
I don't know
how to spell yatagan,

30:46.012 --> 30:47.246
but here I am making one.

30:47.279 --> 30:49.916
*

30:49.949 --> 30:52.018
I've never made
a blade this long,

30:52.051 --> 30:54.520
and I've never made one that
requires such an ornate handle,

30:54.553 --> 30:56.655
so I'm nervous.
This is gonna have

30:56.688 --> 30:58.657
to chop through a pig,
a thigh bone,

30:58.690 --> 31:01.360
maybe try to cut through
Will's biceps, I don't know.

31:01.393 --> 31:03.429
I'm gonna make it to cut.

31:03.462 --> 31:05.264
I think I've got
the curve right.

31:05.297 --> 31:07.233
I think I'm sitting pretty.

31:07.266 --> 31:09.435
Gabe, my competitor,
is a very competent smith,

31:09.468 --> 31:11.603
so hopefully, I'll have
a blade that will stand up

31:11.637 --> 31:13.405
and equal or surpass his.

31:13.439 --> 31:18.577
*

31:18.610 --> 31:20.246
- I'm making a yatagan,

31:20.279 --> 31:24.683
a crazy cool,
slashing looking sword.

31:24.716 --> 31:27.053
It's very important to get
the rough shape today,

31:27.086 --> 31:29.188
and if I do not get the rough
shape knocked out today,

31:29.221 --> 31:33.359
then that will throw the rest
of the four days way behind.

31:33.392 --> 31:36.162
I don't have a power hammer
or a forging press,

31:36.195 --> 31:38.297
so I have a lot of work ahead.

31:38.330 --> 31:41.667
This is my power hammer here.

31:41.700 --> 31:44.203
I think I'm the underdog.
Dave's got the upper hand.

31:44.236 --> 31:46.138
He's been doing it
for a lot longer.

31:46.172 --> 31:48.274
It's his to lose, I think,
and I hope I gonna come in there

31:48.307 --> 31:51.077
and sneak and take it from him.
I really like the shape.

31:51.110 --> 31:53.645
Dave, you're going down, buddy.

31:53.679 --> 31:57.083
- Today, the plan is to make
my mokume billet

31:57.116 --> 31:59.518
for the bolsters
and the ornamentation

31:59.551 --> 32:02.354
that goes on the side
of the blade.

32:02.388 --> 32:06.258
Mokume technique, in Japanese,
means wood grain metal.

32:06.292 --> 32:09.095
It's laminated nickel,
silver and copper,

32:09.128 --> 32:11.497
and I'm squeezing them
together under high heat,

32:11.530 --> 32:13.332
and they should bind and create

32:13.365 --> 32:15.434
an interesting pattern
in that steel.

32:15.467 --> 32:17.503
All right, that's for later.

32:17.536 --> 32:19.305
It's quite time consuming,

32:19.338 --> 32:20.672
but I think the end product
will be worth it,

32:20.706 --> 32:22.674
assuming it takes.

32:22.708 --> 32:24.643
That's hot.

32:24.676 --> 32:27.679
Now I see if I've got
a viable billet.

32:27.713 --> 32:29.215
Yes.

32:29.248 --> 32:31.317
Not molten, also a good sign.

32:31.350 --> 32:33.419
This better be worth it.

32:33.452 --> 32:36.022
- The one thing I'm
concentrating on the most today

32:36.055 --> 32:38.424
is making sure everything
is symmetrical

32:38.457 --> 32:39.992
and getting ready
for heat treatment.

32:40.026 --> 32:41.994
I'm feeling a little nervous.

32:42.028 --> 32:43.562
You have something out of whack,
and it will pull.

32:43.595 --> 32:46.198
That's one way
you can cause warps,

32:46.232 --> 32:48.534
but I'm praying and hoping
that's not an issue.

32:48.567 --> 32:50.469
I've got the sword in the kiln.

32:50.502 --> 32:52.638
Everything's prepared.

32:52.671 --> 32:55.041
I took extra time to make sure
everything's flat and true.

32:55.074 --> 32:57.476
I hope everything
comes out nice and hard.

32:57.509 --> 32:59.378
If the heat treat
does not go well,

32:59.411 --> 33:01.713
I'll be chasing
my tail for hours

33:01.747 --> 33:03.649
until I'm caught back up
where I need to be,

33:03.682 --> 33:05.417
so this is very important.

33:05.451 --> 33:12.324
*

33:12.358 --> 33:16.262
Ooh, [bleep], [bleep].
that's developed.

33:16.295 --> 33:18.464
I have a nice warp.

33:18.497 --> 33:20.732
I don't have time
to make another blade.

33:20.766 --> 33:22.334
I have to fix this warp

33:22.368 --> 33:26.272
or I have no shot at winning.

33:26.305 --> 33:29.241
[groans]

33:29.275 --> 33:31.810
I'm gonna clamp
the blade in a position

33:31.843 --> 33:34.446
so that the warp
is over corrected

33:34.480 --> 33:37.249
and hopefully it'll
fix itself in the temper.

33:37.283 --> 33:39.685
Otherwise, I have no idea
what I'm gonna do.

33:39.718 --> 33:43.155
- The mokume came out great.
It was worth it,

33:43.189 --> 33:44.556
and yesterday
I quenched the blade,

33:44.590 --> 33:46.592
and it came out
straight and hard.

33:46.625 --> 33:48.494
Today, I'll start working
on the ebony handle.

33:48.527 --> 33:51.197
So that to that.

33:51.230 --> 33:53.832
I chose ebony
because it's really pretty wood.

33:53.865 --> 33:55.634
The material
is a little brittle,

33:55.667 --> 33:57.669
but I think it should
be just fine.

33:57.703 --> 34:00.072
I'm not really sure if I got
this thing fitted properly.

34:00.106 --> 34:03.275
I'm gonna hope
for the best right now.

34:03.309 --> 34:05.211
Success!

34:05.244 --> 34:07.513
I would like the test
to be on a banana.

34:07.546 --> 34:09.348
A nice soft banana,

34:09.381 --> 34:11.617
but I suspect
it's gonna be a giraffe,

34:11.650 --> 34:14.453
or a fire hydrant,
or a cuckoo clock.

34:14.486 --> 34:15.754
I don't know what
they're gonna come up with.

34:15.787 --> 34:16.855
I hope it does well.

34:16.888 --> 34:21.260
*

34:21.293 --> 34:25.631
- I fixed the warp as best
as I possibly could.

34:25.664 --> 34:28.567
The goal for the day is to be
dialed in on the handle.

34:28.600 --> 34:29.668
I'm going with this marble wood.

34:29.701 --> 34:32.138
It's already square.

34:32.171 --> 34:34.573
It's got some width so that
I can sculpt in the ears.

34:34.606 --> 34:38.144
*

34:38.177 --> 34:41.147
We are all together.

34:41.180 --> 34:43.515
This sword I have dubbed
Dumbo

34:43.549 --> 34:46.418
because it looks like
an elephant.

34:46.452 --> 34:49.455
Everything's come together
to something I'm proud of.

34:49.488 --> 34:51.257
Let's go whack something,
shall we?

34:51.290 --> 34:52.624
*

34:52.658 --> 34:53.892
Pretty clean cut.

34:53.925 --> 34:56.595
*

34:56.628 --> 34:58.364
Call that a day.

34:58.397 --> 35:01.567
*

35:01.600 --> 35:03.902
- Bladesmiths,
welcome back to the Forge.

35:03.935 --> 35:05.604
You've had five days
at your home forges

35:05.637 --> 35:07.173
to work on your yatagan.

35:07.206 --> 35:08.574
Dave, how did it go?

35:08.607 --> 35:11.410
- It was grueling,
but I got it done.

35:11.443 --> 35:14.846
I used W2.
I used Ebony for the handle.

35:14.880 --> 35:17.616
I used mokume-gane
for the fittings.

35:17.649 --> 35:21.220
- Gabe, how did it go for you?
- It went pretty well.

35:21.253 --> 35:23.322
My yatagan's made out
of W2 as well,

35:23.355 --> 35:24.856
and the handle's sculpted

35:24.890 --> 35:27.326
out of marble wood.
One solid piece.

35:27.359 --> 35:30.396
- They look fantastic,
but we know what comes next,

35:30.429 --> 35:31.797
and that's the weapons test.

35:31.830 --> 35:34.433
Up first,
the kill test. Doug?

35:34.466 --> 35:36.635
*

35:36.668 --> 35:38.837
- Bladesmiths, to see
what kind of lethal damage

35:38.870 --> 35:40.839
your weapon will do,
I'll take your yatagan

35:40.872 --> 35:43.409
and deliver slashes and thrusts
on this ballistics dummy.

35:43.442 --> 35:45.344
Dave, you're first.
Are you ready?

35:45.377 --> 35:47.713
- Yes, sir.
- Let's do this.

35:47.746 --> 35:49.615
- I'm so nervous right now,

35:49.648 --> 35:53.252
and I am just hoping
my blade will perform well.

35:53.285 --> 36:00.192
*

36:06.398 --> 36:08.334
- It's got bowels
dropping out everywhere.

36:08.367 --> 36:10.269
*

36:10.302 --> 36:11.870
- Let's talk about
your weapon, Dave.

36:11.903 --> 36:13.839
It follows the feel of a yatagan

36:13.872 --> 36:16.408
that's supposed to be
light and deadly.

36:16.442 --> 36:18.744
The edge you have here is sharp

36:18.777 --> 36:21.213
where it's curved
into lacerate.

36:21.247 --> 36:23.315
Your yatagan will kill.

36:23.349 --> 36:26.352
- Thank you very much.
- All right, Gabe, your turn.

36:26.385 --> 36:27.753
You ready?
- Go nuts, man.

36:27.786 --> 36:29.221
- Let's do this.

36:29.255 --> 36:30.756
- Dave's blade performed,

36:30.789 --> 36:32.558
seemingly really well.

36:32.591 --> 36:33.859
Guts falling out of the thing

36:33.892 --> 36:34.993
and blood everywhere,

36:35.026 --> 36:36.562
so a little nerve-wracking

36:36.595 --> 36:37.629
knowing that I'll have to,
at least,

36:37.663 --> 36:39.698
measure up to that.

36:39.731 --> 36:46.638
*

36:52.644 --> 36:54.613
- All right, Gabe.

36:54.646 --> 36:57.383
It is so light it really feels
like it's not there.

36:57.416 --> 36:59.351
It's almost scary.

36:59.385 --> 37:03.021
When I thrust, it penetrates
easily and slashes down.

37:03.054 --> 37:06.492
Overall, sir,
your blade will kill.

37:06.525 --> 37:07.959
- Thank you.

37:07.993 --> 37:09.695
- I think we cut
quite similarly.

37:09.728 --> 37:11.663
I would prefer to be ahead,
but right now,

37:11.697 --> 37:13.499
I feel like
we're neck-and-neck.

37:13.532 --> 37:16.635
- All right, gentlemen,
this is the strength test.

37:16.668 --> 37:18.537
To test the strength
of your weapon,

37:18.570 --> 37:21.707
I'll be chopping
into these bones six times.

37:21.740 --> 37:23.709
Dave, you're up first.

37:23.742 --> 37:26.578
- Hacking bone is a very
difficult thing to do

37:26.612 --> 37:28.380
with a thin edge.

37:28.414 --> 37:30.882
I'm aghast knowing
what's going to be coming.

37:30.916 --> 37:37.856
*

37:46.031 --> 37:48.334
- All right, David,
that's a tough test.

37:48.367 --> 37:50.636
Those are very thick bones,

37:50.669 --> 37:52.504
but what we've got going on here

37:52.538 --> 37:55.474
is a lot of chipping
and distortion on your blade.

37:55.507 --> 37:59.878
We've also got a major crack
in your handle

37:59.911 --> 38:03.415
that runs right up
through the pins.

38:03.449 --> 38:04.850
All right, Gabe, your turn.

38:04.883 --> 38:06.918
You ready for this?
- Go nuts.

38:06.952 --> 38:09.888
I'm looking at the damage
that his blade received,

38:09.921 --> 38:11.657
and I'm looking at my blade,

38:11.690 --> 38:13.925
and they're constructed
very similarly.

38:13.959 --> 38:17.529
I have this 1.2-pound sword.

38:17.563 --> 38:19.931
I'm worried that the blade's
gonna blow up.

38:19.965 --> 38:23.535
*

38:23.569 --> 38:30.509
*

38:37.483 --> 38:38.917
- Okay, Gabe.

38:38.950 --> 38:40.752
The convex edge
you've got on here

38:40.786 --> 38:42.854
is pretty much the perfect edge

38:42.888 --> 38:44.690
for a test like this.

38:44.723 --> 38:47.659
Sharp and strong.

38:47.693 --> 38:52.698
I can feel just
the smallest amount of a roll.

38:52.731 --> 38:54.400
Nicely done.

38:54.433 --> 38:56.001
- Thank you.
- All right, gentlemen.

38:56.034 --> 38:57.569
Next up the sharpness test.

38:57.603 --> 38:59.571
For that,
I'll give it to Doug.

38:59.605 --> 39:03.141
- I have edge damage.
I have handle damage.

39:03.174 --> 39:07.613
It's disheartening,
but it's not over yet.

39:07.646 --> 39:11.383
- Bladesmiths, to see if
your blade is still sharp,

39:11.417 --> 39:14.052
I will take your weapon
and slash through these silks.

39:14.085 --> 39:17.589
If the blade is still sharp,
it should cut cleanly.

39:17.623 --> 39:21.092
If not, it may rip, or tear,
or worse, do nothing.

39:21.126 --> 39:22.794
Dave, you're up first.
Are you ready?

39:22.828 --> 39:24.996
- Yes, sir.
- Let's do this.

39:25.030 --> 39:31.970
*

39:37.142 --> 39:40.779
All right, I love the balance
of your blade.

39:40.812 --> 39:43.014
I like the way it curves in,

39:43.048 --> 39:46.051
but you can really feel
the edges now.

39:46.084 --> 39:48.053
It's serrated.

39:48.086 --> 39:50.589
It hangs up with silk,
but then on the last piece,

39:50.622 --> 39:51.990
just when it's nice and taught,

39:52.023 --> 39:54.159
you can lacerate
and cut through it.

39:54.192 --> 39:56.595
Overall,
your blade will still cut.

39:56.628 --> 39:58.430
- Thank you.

39:58.464 --> 39:59.898
- All right, Gabe,
it's your turn. You ready?

39:59.931 --> 40:02.100
- I'm ready.
- Let's do this.

40:02.133 --> 40:09.074
*

40:19.150 --> 40:22.888
All right, Gabe,
your blade is so light,

40:22.921 --> 40:25.056
you're barely,
like, cutting through air.

40:25.090 --> 40:27.893
I glide it through this,
lacerate it,

40:27.926 --> 40:30.128
and, of course,
on the finishing cuts here,

40:30.161 --> 40:32.931
cut easily through that silk.

40:32.964 --> 40:35.066
It cuts.
Good job.

40:35.100 --> 40:37.836
- Thank you very much.

40:37.869 --> 40:41.139
- Bladesmiths, you both created
remarkable finale weapons,

40:41.172 --> 40:43.208
but in this arena
of competition,

40:43.241 --> 40:45.844
there can only be one
"Forged in Fire" Champion,

40:45.877 --> 40:47.078
and that champion is...

40:47.112 --> 40:50.949
*

40:50.982 --> 40:53.485
Gabe. Congratulations,

40:53.519 --> 40:55.153
you are the
"Forged in Fire" Champion.

40:55.186 --> 40:58.256
Dave, your weapon
did not make the cut.

40:58.289 --> 41:00.225
- Dave, you brought us
an outstanding weapon.

41:00.258 --> 41:01.893
That yatagan is fantastic,

41:01.927 --> 41:04.129
but during the strength test,

41:04.162 --> 41:06.665
we lost structural integrity
in the edge of your blade,

41:06.698 --> 41:08.967
and in the handle,
with both scales fracturing,

41:09.000 --> 41:10.802
and those are things we,
obviously, can't overlook,

41:10.836 --> 41:11.870
so that's why
we're gonna let you go.

41:11.903 --> 41:13.539
- Sure.

41:13.572 --> 41:16.174
- Dave, please surrender
your weapon.

41:16.207 --> 41:18.176
- It's exactly what I expected.

41:18.209 --> 41:19.978
It was very difficult testing,

41:20.011 --> 41:22.147
but I'm still the guy
with the cracked edge

41:22.180 --> 41:24.215
and the broken handle.

41:24.249 --> 41:26.284
It's like going out
with a beautiful blonde

41:26.317 --> 41:29.254
and finding out she has BO,

41:29.287 --> 41:31.790
and my blade has BO.

41:31.823 --> 41:34.793

41:34.826 --> 41:37.796
- Gabe, congratulations, you are
the "Forged in Fire" Champion

41:37.829 --> 41:40.098
and will be receiving
a check for $10,000.

41:40.131 --> 41:41.900
Good job.

41:41.933 --> 41:43.535
I've never seen
anybody less stoked about

41:43.569 --> 41:45.236
getting ten grand
in my entire life.

41:45.270 --> 41:46.872
[laughter]
Why don't you please present

41:46.905 --> 41:49.040
that weapon to the judges?

41:49.074 --> 41:50.876
- It feels great to be
the "Forged in Fire" Champion,

41:50.909 --> 41:53.679
but I'll do my celebrating
behind closed doors.

41:53.712 --> 41:55.714
1I felt like I was the underdog,

41:55.747 --> 41:58.249
but underdogs win sometimes,
I guess. [laughs]

41:58.283 --> 42:03.188
