11:33.359 --> 11:36.726
- He-He needs a wipe, Your Honor.
- Sit down, Miss Teeger.

11:36.796 --> 11:40.527
<i>Sit down. Now, if you interfere</i>

[Mouthing Words]

11:40.599 --> 11:42.760
<i>I will have you arrested</i>

11:42.835 --> 11:46.794
- Understand?
- Yes, sir. Sorry.
[Clears Throat]

11:46.872 --> 11:51.241
Let the record show that
the witness has identified
the defendant,

<i>Thank you. Thank you.</i>
<i>None for you. Okay.</i>

12:17.336 --> 12:20.772
What did you think?
I thought it was pretty interesting.

12:20.840 --> 12:24.435
Very interesting.
I filled up three notebooks.

12:24.510 --> 12:26.671

So we can all concentrate

12:49.135 --> 12:51.467

12:51.537 --> 12:54.404
<i>[Blinds Sliding]</i>
Okay, everyone, let's get started.

12:54.473 --> 12:59.137
I've done this before, so, um,
I would be glad to be our foreman,
if there are no objections.

12:59.211 --> 13:02.840
<i>[Jurors] No.</i>
<i>[Man] All right. Great.</i>
<i>Well, let's all have a seat.</i>

Actually, it'd be best
if we all sat in order,
if you don't mind.

13:07.720 --> 13:12.657
I'm Juror Number Seven,
then we'll go this way-
Number Eight, so forth.

13:12.725 --> 13:14.659
Okay. Great.

13:15.861 --> 13:17.795
You look happy.

13:17.863 --> 13:21.492
This is very exciting for me.
I feel like a real American.

13:21.567 --> 13:25.526
Excuse me.
Do you mind if we tr- traded seats?
Yeah? Why?

13:25.604 --> 13:30.064
Well, I'd rather be number 10.
My favorite number, and-

13:30.142 --> 13:32.804
- It's kind of important to me.
- Look, the guy is trying
to change seats.

13:32.878 --> 13:37.008
You know what, pal?
Nobody's trading anything with you.
Now sit down. Okay?

13:37.082 --> 13:39.880
<i>I mean it. Sit. Okay?</i>

13:44.256 --> 13:46.656
So I've been on a few juries,
and it's customary...

13:46.725 --> 13:49.990
to start off with a preliminary vote
by secret ballot...

13:50.062 --> 13:51.996
just to see where we all are.

13:52.064 --> 13:55.158
Any objections? Great.

No.

<i>Thank you.</i>

<i>Oh, please don't smoke.</i>

Just pass them down, please.

<i>[Juror Number Seven]</i>
<i>All right. Well, let's do this.</i>

14:17.623 --> 14:19.557
"Guilty."

"Guilty."

14:23.495 --> 14:26.953

<i>Wow, that was easy.</i>
<i>Guess I'll be home for dinner.</i>
[Jurors Murmur]

14:50.222 --> 14:54.556
Wait a minute. That was only 11.
Who didn't vote?

15:02.468 --> 15:04.436

16:15.374 --> 16:18.138
- Thank you.
- It's no problem.

16:21.814 --> 16:24.544
- "Not guilty."
- [Groaning]

16:24.616 --> 16:26.550
That makes it 11 to one.

16:26.618 --> 16:28.643
There's always one, isn't there?
Always one.

16:28.721 --> 16:32.817
- Do you really think he's not guilty?
- I don't know.

16:32.891 --> 16:35.416
Of course he's guilty.
Look at the evidence.

16:35.494 --> 16:39.521
They found the knife-
the knife he used- in his knapsack.

16:39.598 --> 16:42.931
Plus, the victim identified him.
I mean, what more do you want?

16:43.002 --> 16:47.063
I don't know.
I have a feeling there's more to it.

16:47.139 --> 16:49.073
<i>A feeling.</i>

16:49.141 --> 16:51.735
I would just like
to think about it for a while.

16:51.810 --> 16:55.143
What do you need to think about?
There's nothing to think about!
There's nothing to-

16:55.214 --> 16:57.705
[Murmuring]
He's guilty.

16:57.783 --> 16:59.876
I'm gonna need you all to be quiet.

16:59.952 --> 17:02.546
[Man]
Yeah, you'll get quiet right here.
Let me concentrate.

17:02.621 --> 17:06.717
Shh. I'm gonna walk around now
and pace back and forth.

17:06.791 --> 17:10.626
Then when I'm ready,
I'll tell you the solution.
That's how it works.

17:13.365 --> 17:16.060
No. No way.

17:16.135 --> 17:18.069
You're not alone here.

17:18.137 --> 17:21.971
You have to talk to us.
Tell us what you're thinking.

17:22.040 --> 17:24.771
That's not how I do it.
I have a system.

17:24.843 --> 17:27.743
It's a gift and a curse.
Here's the thing.

17:27.813 --> 17:29.906
I don't like working with partners.

17:29.982 --> 17:32.815
Well, like it or not,
you've got 11 partners now.

17:37.489 --> 17:40.117
Pay attention.
I'm only gonna say this once.

17:40.192 --> 17:42.752
Escobar's hearing
is tomorrow at 12:00 noon.

17:42.828 --> 17:45.558
We lock this joint down
tonight at midnight-

17:45.631 --> 17:47.997
every exit, every window.

17:48.067 --> 17:51.161
1:00 a.m., we sweep for bombs,
head to toe.

17:51.236 --> 17:56.196
6:00 a.m., I want snipers
on this roof and on the roof next door.

17:56.275 --> 18:01.838
We arrive at 11:30.
At 11:40, we meet Lapides
at the elevator and hand him off.

18:01.914 --> 18:05.042
After that,
he's the bureau's headache.

18:05.117 --> 18:07.950
Sir, could you, uh,
repeat that, please?
Yeah. What part?

18:08.020 --> 18:12.286
Uh, everything after
"Pay attention.
I'm only gonna say this once."

<i>What's he doing now?</i>

18:30.843 --> 18:34.404

Did you talk to the judge?

18:34.480 --> 18:37.574
<i>He says it's too late.</i>
<i>He's already sent</i>
<i>the alternates home.</i>

19:07.112 --> 19:10.172
Would you mind
trying these on?
What for?

19:10.249 --> 19:13.013
You're about the same height
as the victim,

19:13.085 --> 19:15.019
and, uh, I just want
to try something.

19:15.087 --> 19:18.523
- It'll just take a minute.
- What do we got?
A fashion show? Huh?

19:18.590 --> 19:20.990
[Laughs]
Can you believe this guy?

19:21.059 --> 19:23.789
We know that these are the pants...

19:23.862 --> 19:27.559
that the victim
was wearing when he was attacked.

19:27.633 --> 19:29.863
Uh, could you step up, please?

19:31.436 --> 19:35.429
Of course, you can see
where the knife
went through the fabric.

19:35.507 --> 19:37.498
Well, something doesn't add up.

19:37.576 --> 19:42.377
<i>I notice that Mr. Palmer</i>
<i>likes to wear his pants low.</i>

19:42.447 --> 19:47.384
In the courtroom, we could
almost see his... bottom part-

19:47.452 --> 19:49.443
Rear. Posterior. Side-

19:49.521 --> 19:51.921
- His butt?
- Thank you.

19:51.990 --> 19:54.925
Look at the wound.

19:54.993 --> 19:59.760
He was actually stabbed
in the upper thigh.

20:02.968 --> 20:05.869
- Doesn't match up.
- He's right. Look at that.

20:05.938 --> 20:10.432
At least not when he's standing.
Could you have a seat, please?

20:16.014 --> 20:18.983
<i>Son of a bitch.</i>
<i>He was sitting down.</i>

20:19.051 --> 20:23.078
- What does that prove?
- Mr. Palmer said he was
standing up when he was stabbed.

20:23.155 --> 20:26.921
He was lying.
<i>[Monk] I think</i>
<i>he pulled into that rest stop,</i>

20:26.992 --> 20:30.428
saw Robert Perry-
who was sleeping-

20:30.495 --> 20:35.330
stabbed himself,
pocketed the money, and then
blamed everything on Perry.

20:40.005 --> 20:43.168
I'm switching my vote...
to not guilty.

20:43.242 --> 20:47.303
<i>[Woman] Oh, come on.</i>
<i>[Woman #2] What? That is ridiculous.</i>
<i>Why would he stab himself?</i>

20:47.379 --> 20:50.906
<i>[Man]</i>
<i>We</i>- <i>We</i>- <i>We should</i>
<i>listen to this man.</i>

20:50.983 --> 20:53.747
<i>He was a very brave man</i>
<i>to stand up against us all.</i>

20:53.819 --> 20:56.617
<i>[Dog Barking]</i>

20:56.688 --> 21:00.624
[Barking Continues]
<i>[Man #2]</i>
<i>What about the DNA evidence?</i>

21:00.692 --> 21:05.186
You can't just ignore that.
They found the victim's blood
on Perry's knife.

21:05.264 --> 21:08.290
How do we know
it was Robert Perry's knife?
He denied ever seeing it.

21:08.367 --> 21:10.927
Of course he denied it.
What the hell do you expect?

21:11.003 --> 21:13.767
- Well, his prints weren't on it.
- Well, then he wiped 'em off. Huh?

21:13.839 --> 21:16.307
Look, it was in his knapsack!

21:16.375 --> 21:18.639
Now what the hell
kind of a detective are you?

21:18.710 --> 21:22.612
I'm the kind of detective
who wonders why someone
would take the time...

21:22.681 --> 21:25.878
to wipe down the handle,
but not the blade.

21:25.951 --> 21:28.715
[Shudders]

21:31.590 --> 21:35.458
Also, the timeline is all wrong.

21:35.527 --> 21:38.690
Robert Perry was picked up
an hour after the assault...

21:38.764 --> 21:41.232
<i>less than two miles from there.</i>

21:41.300 --> 21:44.167
So what?
<i>He wasn't running away.</i>

21:44.236 --> 21:46.966
If I had just stabbed somebody-

21:47.039 --> 21:49.837
- Somebody moved that tarp.
- Excuse me?

21:51.310 --> 21:53.676
There's a Dumpster down there
with a tarp in it.

21:53.745 --> 21:58.182
<i>Yesterday the tarp was rolled up</i>
<i>and draped over the side.</i>

21:58.250 --> 22:01.413
What does this have to do with us
or this case?

22:01.486 --> 22:04.751
- Or anything.
- I'm sorry.
You're right. You're right.

22:04.823 --> 22:08.657
Okay. What's next?
The money. Okay. The money.
What happened to the money?

22:08.727 --> 22:11.025
- Maybe he buried it.
- Lime.

22:12.164 --> 22:17.067
Somebody poured lime
all over that tarp.

22:17.135 --> 22:19.103
I think there's a body down there.

22:19.171 --> 22:21.366
Oh, we're never
getting out of here.

22:29.314 --> 22:31.407
but there's a Dumpster downstairs.

22:31.483 --> 22:34.384
<i>I saw a police dog sniffing around.</i>

22:34.453 --> 22:37.854

<i>Judge Rienzo said I should</i>
<i>keep an eye on you.</i>

No. Nah, nah. No.

Okay, wait. A body?
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.

23:53.498 --> 23:56.524
We should not listen
to this man.

23:56.601 --> 23:58.967
He is ruining America

24:05.544 --> 24:10.811
Tell me again. I've been called away
from the most important case
of my career because-

24:10.882 --> 24:14.818
- 'Cause Mr. Monk said he saw a body.
- From up there? From the third floor?

24:14.886 --> 24:17.116
While he was deliberating
on another case?

24:17.189 --> 24:19.714
<i>[Disher]</i>
<i>Captain.!</i>

24:38.443 --> 24:42.004
<i>Well, he was right about the body.</i>

24:42.080 --> 24:45.880
People, whatever happened
down there has nothing
to do with us.

24:45.951 --> 24:49.409
- We still have a job to do.
- Maybe we should take another vote.

24:49.488 --> 24:52.889
Good idea. Let's just see
who stands where, all right?

24:52.958 --> 24:54.892
Everybody back.

24:54.960 --> 24:57.724
Now, just by a show of hands,

24:57.796 --> 25:00.822

- Guilty.

25:02.634 --> 25:05.728
Not guilty?

25:07.005 --> 25:11.408
- Six to six.
- And we go into extra innings.
