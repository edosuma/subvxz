00:17.100 --> 00:20.812
I was attacked by some creature thing
at the sinkhole.

00:21.396 --> 00:23.773
A creature thing? What the hell, Nic?

00:23.857 --> 00:27.777
It's okay. I fought it off.
Whatever it was, it ran into the woods.

00:27.861 --> 00:30.572
Which means it's still out there.
Great, that makes me feel better.

00:30.655 --> 00:32.157
We have people looking for it.

00:33.283 --> 00:37.954
These scratches are a little bit deep,
but as long as they don't get infected,

00:38.038 --> 00:39.122
you'll be okay.

00:39.205 --> 00:41.082
Now, what did this<i> thing</i> look like?

00:42.167 --> 00:48.381
Um, well, it had skin that looked
like decaying flowers and buds,

00:48.465 --> 00:51.342
and the walls of the sinkhole
were covered in the same flowers,

00:51.426 --> 00:55.930
so it must be connected to the creature,
or maybe the creature was infected there.

00:56.014 --> 00:58.975
A day ago there were no signs of life.
The ground was dying.

00:59.059 --> 01:01.478
Well, whatever is there now
is very much alive.

01:01.561 --> 01:02.645
Not for long.

01:03.354 --> 01:06.399
I'm sending a team of BIONA techs
to go scorched-earth on the sinkhole.

01:06.483 --> 01:09.152
-Kill anything inside it.
-What about the other sites?

01:09.778 --> 01:12.030
-What other sites?

01:12.113 --> 01:14.616
We found sinkholes around the world

01:14.699 --> 01:17.410
in places where the Crooked Man
killed Powered people.

01:18.036 --> 01:20.205
He killed Charlotte Tuck
outside this house.

01:20.288 --> 01:21.623
We have seen no activity here.

01:21.706 --> 01:24.793
-There's no reason to believe that--
-Reason? You're talking reason?

01:24.876 --> 01:28.004
Pat comes back from the dead,
a hole in the ground goes crazy,

01:28.088 --> 01:30.590
and my sister is knocked around
by a plant monster.

01:31.091 --> 01:32.717
We are way beyond reason.

01:33.802 --> 01:36.262
Dion has a target on his back.

01:36.346 --> 01:39.891
It's like every crazy thing
in the universe is gunning for him.

01:40.475 --> 01:43.353
And Pat said that something terrible
is coming to Atlanta,

01:44.229 --> 01:46.898
but he meant it was coming here… for Dion.

02:19.806 --> 02:20.807
Light it up.

02:25.103 --> 02:26.020
Suzanne.

02:26.896 --> 02:27.814
Suzanne!

02:27.897 --> 02:29.107
What are you doing?

02:29.190 --> 02:30.650
Why are you here?

02:31.693 --> 02:33.778
You're blasting the sinkhole with CO2?

02:33.862 --> 02:36.364
We are destroying
whatever electrical charge is down there

02:36.447 --> 02:37.782
and then sealing it up.

02:38.283 --> 02:42.245
The site is changing. Suzanne,
it's evolving. We should be studying it.

02:42.328 --> 02:45.707
A creature crawled out of there
and attacked Nicole.

02:45.790 --> 02:49.460
Yes, and I know she's your friend,
but you're the one who taught me

02:49.544 --> 02:52.172
to never let my emotions
get in the way of science.

02:52.255 --> 02:54.507
We should be trying to understand
what we're dealing with.

02:54.591 --> 02:57.635
"We" don't need to do anything, David.

02:58.303 --> 03:00.680
-You're suspended.
-All right, standby.

03:00.763 --> 03:02.515
-Because I brought Pat here?
-Yes.

03:03.391 --> 03:04.601
I'm trying to help you.

03:05.226 --> 03:07.312
You've spent millions
on R&D in the last two years.

03:07.395 --> 03:10.273
-The BIONA board is itching--
-For something they can make billions on?

03:10.356 --> 03:12.442
Yes, I am very aware.

03:15.320 --> 03:17.071
There's been talk of replacing you.

03:22.619 --> 03:25.371
-You've been talking to Cutler?
-He reached out.

03:26.456 --> 03:27.916
I'm telling you as a friend.

03:28.499 --> 03:30.210
Suzanne, we can use this.

03:31.502 --> 03:34.005
You should've seen
when Rollins put his hands in the soil.

03:34.088 --> 03:35.798
There's something powerful down there.

03:35.882 --> 03:38.885
You went behind my back
and let a murderer out of his cell.

03:38.968 --> 03:41.179
I didn't tell you
so you wouldn't take the heat.

03:41.262 --> 03:43.723
You didn't ask me
because you knew I would say no.

03:46.768 --> 03:49.520
Pat Rollins still has
the Crooked Man energy inside him.

04:09.874 --> 04:10.708
<i>Mom?</i>

04:11.876 --> 04:12.835
<i>Mom, are you awake?</i>

04:16.089 --> 04:17.548
Mom, your alarm's going off.

04:18.508 --> 04:19.342
Mom, get up!

04:23.263 --> 04:24.681
It's that late already?

04:25.431 --> 04:27.267
Auntie Kat did say to let you sleep.

04:27.976 --> 04:29.811
I don't have time to sleep.

04:30.353 --> 04:31.813
She rescheduled your Zoom meeting.

04:32.313 --> 04:34.565
Is she your assistant
now that she's not a doctor?

04:34.649 --> 04:36.526
No, she's still a doctor.

04:37.443 --> 04:40.071
Telemedicine is medicine,
even if it happens from our living room.

04:41.489 --> 04:43.658
School's out because of a gas leak,

04:43.741 --> 04:46.411
which probably means
Mr. Campbell got stuck in the bathroom.

04:47.870 --> 04:49.497
-Oh, you.

04:50.373 --> 04:51.457
So, how was the sinkhole?

04:53.459 --> 04:54.335
Um…

04:56.129 --> 04:58.589
It was nothing. False alarm.

04:59.424 --> 05:03.761
-Really?
-Mm-hmm. Ms. Suzanne has it taken care of.

05:03.845 --> 05:05.471
Wait, what happened to your arm?

05:08.808 --> 05:11.477
I… fell and scratched it up.

05:11.978 --> 05:12.854
No biggie.

05:13.771 --> 05:17.483
Okay, well, since school's out,
can we go to Six Flags?

05:18.818 --> 05:20.820
-You need to stay inside today.
-Why?

05:21.321 --> 05:24.073
You said that one day
I could take a day off school and…

05:24.157 --> 05:26.117
And then I could go on the Batman ride.

05:27.035 --> 05:30.580
I know, and we will, just not today.

05:30.663 --> 05:31.706
I'm just busy.

05:31.789 --> 05:34.375
Busy with what? You're always busy.

05:34.459 --> 05:36.711
I just have to take care
of a couple things.

05:37.211 --> 05:41.132
We will find some time and we will do
something fun later. Okay? I promise.

05:43.009 --> 05:43.843
Okay.

05:57.565 --> 05:58.733
Why didn't you wake me?

05:59.233 --> 06:01.402
You needed the sleep. How's your arm?

06:03.112 --> 06:04.030
Come here.

06:06.616 --> 06:08.493
You have no business going to BIONA.

06:09.410 --> 06:11.037
Let them clean up their own mess.

06:12.789 --> 06:14.832
Well, I'm already part of the mess now.

06:29.847 --> 06:31.432
Can I ask Brayden over to hang out?

06:32.183 --> 06:34.268
-Who's Brayden?
-New kid at school.

06:35.061 --> 06:38.564
Uh, okay. Have his parents text me…
Actually…

06:38.648 --> 06:39.941
I can watch them.

06:40.024 --> 06:42.151
Text Auntie Kat. Okay?

06:42.235 --> 06:44.612
And, uh, is Esperanza
and Jonathan coming too?

06:45.363 --> 06:46.531
No, just Brayden.

06:47.949 --> 06:52.203
Okay. Make sure you let Auntie Kat work,
and you can't leave the apartment.

06:52.286 --> 06:55.123
-Why? Is this because of Pat?
-Partly.

06:55.206 --> 06:59.210
I need to go to BIONA and make sure
that you and I and everyone is safe. Okay?

06:59.293 --> 07:00.795
So stay inside.

07:01.963 --> 07:03.339
-Got it.
-All right.

07:11.889 --> 07:14.892
So, I have some news.

07:15.393 --> 07:20.440
Mr. Kwame wants me to do a big number
at the end of the school musical revue.

07:20.523 --> 07:22.191
With the song you auditioned with?

07:22.275 --> 07:26.028
No, Mr. Kwame said
he wasn't "feeling the folk songs,"

07:26.112 --> 07:28.614
so we're gonna do <i>Dreamgirls </i>instead.

07:28.698 --> 07:31.826
<i>I looked it up.</i>
<i>It's a musical about Beyoncé.</i>

07:31.909 --> 07:33.035
Well, that's great.

07:33.119 --> 07:35.538
No, it's not.
I don't want to be out front.

07:35.621 --> 07:38.583
-I want to be in the chorus.
-<i>Why?</i>

07:41.085 --> 07:45.756
-I'm Invisible Girl. That's <i>my </i>superpower.
-<i>You're not really invisible, you know?</i>

07:45.840 --> 07:46.716
I know.

07:46.799 --> 07:49.010
-<i>But don't you want to sing?</i>
-Yeah, but--

07:49.093 --> 07:51.804
-But what?
-I don't want everyone staring at me!

07:53.306 --> 07:54.390
You're awesome.

07:57.435 --> 07:59.145
You're not like anybody else.

08:02.023 --> 08:04.817
<i>And if you want to sit in the back</i>
<i>of the chorus and be invisible,</i>

08:04.901 --> 08:05.985
<i>that's fine, but</i>

08:07.737 --> 08:10.740
<i>I'm just saying</i>
<i>that when we have super powers,</i>

08:11.407 --> 08:13.910
<i>I think we should share them</i>
<i>with others who don't.</i>

08:13.993 --> 08:19.123
<i>And I think it'd be really great</i>
<i>if they saw your other superpower.</i>

08:21.250 --> 08:22.126
<i>Singing.</i>

08:22.210 --> 08:23.836
Yeah, I got that.

08:23.920 --> 08:25.922
-Oh, Brayden's here.

08:26.005 --> 08:28.007
-Brayden?
-<i>We're gonna hang out.</i>

08:28.674 --> 08:29.509
Oh.

08:32.261 --> 08:33.471
You must be Brayden.

08:36.307 --> 08:38.935
I should probably go
introduce myself to your parents.

08:39.018 --> 08:41.312
They're gone.
My mom had to go to the store,

08:41.395 --> 08:43.022
so she dropped me out front and left.

08:43.523 --> 08:44.482
Hmm.

08:44.565 --> 08:47.985
What's up, dude? How awesome is it
that school's closed today?

08:49.403 --> 08:50.571
Um, you gotta…

08:50.655 --> 08:51.948
-Pound it.

08:52.615 --> 08:55.201
Boom! Come on.
I'll show you around the house.

08:58.538 --> 09:01.040
So Pat's been lying to us
this entire time.

09:01.123 --> 09:03.042
I don't think he has, actually.

09:03.125 --> 09:05.378
His cells only contained
a trace electrical charge.

09:05.461 --> 09:06.879
Only a trace?

09:06.963 --> 09:09.757
And we have safeguards.
L5 is temperature-controlled.

09:09.840 --> 09:11.717
There are guards
with CO2 guns at the ready.

09:13.719 --> 09:15.304
I still don't trust him.

09:16.472 --> 09:17.306
Me either.

09:18.808 --> 09:21.519
But he did bring back
valuable intel from the sinkhole.

09:22.645 --> 09:25.731
The soil reacted
to the electrical charge still inside him.

09:26.315 --> 09:30.403
David described it as having
an almost magnetic pull to Pat.

09:32.947 --> 09:35.741
The sinkhole must have
some of the same electrical charge.

09:35.825 --> 09:37.910
Pat said when we destroyed
the Crooked Man,

09:37.994 --> 09:40.788
all that terrible dark energy
inside him was dispersed.

09:40.871 --> 09:45.209
So if Pat still has some of it in him,
then where did the rest of it go?

09:46.752 --> 09:48.087
Take a look at this.

09:49.422 --> 09:50.923
This was outside of Atlanta.

09:53.009 --> 09:54.969
Less than 24 hours later,

09:55.052 --> 09:57.555
there was a spike in activity
at the sinkhole.

09:57.638 --> 10:01.017
And all of a sudden,
Pat happens to show up at the same time.

10:01.100 --> 10:04.020
He saw it on the news.
Said he came back here to stop it.

10:07.982 --> 10:09.358
That's not the Crooked Man.

10:10.192 --> 10:11.277
That's something new.

10:17.617 --> 10:21.412
-You've read all these comics?
-Yup. You like <i>Teen Titans</i>?

10:21.495 --> 10:23.205
I don't really read comic books.

10:26.292 --> 10:29.879
-Is that your superhero design?
-Yeah. I've been working on that one.

10:30.463 --> 10:32.548
It's my favorite, but I got a whole bunch.

10:32.632 --> 10:34.967
I'm still working
on the color scheme and logo.

10:35.468 --> 10:37.678
It should be all black, like Kylo Ren.

10:38.638 --> 10:41.307
Like Darth Vader and Darth Maul.

10:42.350 --> 10:44.477
Exactly. The cool ones.

10:45.102 --> 10:46.687
Want more snacks?

10:46.771 --> 10:47.772
Actually,

10:49.190 --> 10:50.816
I brought some stuff.

10:53.110 --> 10:54.320
Sour Patch Kids!

10:54.904 --> 10:57.907
Did you read my mind again?
That stuff really freaks me out.

10:58.407 --> 11:00.826
So you don't want any? 'Cause, like--

11:00.910 --> 11:02.370
I didn't say that.

11:07.249 --> 11:10.795
-You sure you want to talk to Pat?
-I don't want to. I need to.

11:10.878 --> 11:14.048
-If he has the information.
-This is my boss. I have to take it.

11:14.131 --> 11:16.050
-If you want to wait--
-I don't.

11:17.802 --> 11:18.761
Hi, Ben.

11:18.844 --> 11:21.514
-<i>Security alert in the Powered area.</i>

11:21.597 --> 11:24.433
<i>All available security</i>
<i>please report to the Powered Wing.</i>

11:24.934 --> 11:27.061
I've had it
with your lack of self-control.

11:27.144 --> 11:29.397
-You're dangerous. What are you thinking?
-Dad!

11:29.480 --> 11:32.149
You could have hurt yourself or us!
You almost hurt my son!

11:32.233 --> 11:33.275
Just leave me alone!

11:34.068 --> 11:35.027
Hey. Come here!

11:35.111 --> 11:36.487
What are you doing?!

11:36.570 --> 11:39.281
-Get her to her room.
-What the hell is going on?

11:39.365 --> 11:42.451
-She tried to hurt my son.
-It was my fault. I surprised her.

11:42.535 --> 11:44.662
He said hello and she blasted everything.

11:44.745 --> 11:46.706
-And tried to escape.
-She's not a prisoner.

11:46.789 --> 11:48.958
Janelle. I'm so sorry.
You have to believe me.

11:49.041 --> 11:51.252
-I didn't mean to scare you.
-Take her to her room.

11:51.335 --> 11:53.504
Her name is Janelle. And where is her mom?

11:54.004 --> 11:55.965
-You didn't even call her mom?

11:56.048 --> 11:58.342
-This is not your concern.
-I think it is.

11:58.426 --> 12:01.220
This is not the first time
a super-powered person

12:01.303 --> 12:03.514
has done something out of the ordinary.

12:03.597 --> 12:05.975
But it's the first time
guards in tactical gear show up.

12:06.058 --> 12:07.393
Can you explain that?

12:07.476 --> 12:10.479
-Janelle. What's going on?
-I want to go back to Chicago!

12:10.563 --> 12:12.940
Your daughter had an outburst.
Her trainer was alarmed.

12:13.023 --> 12:15.609
She'll be detained until we determine
she's no longer a threat.

12:17.445 --> 12:19.238
Let's dial back
the temperature some, yeah?

12:20.072 --> 12:23.242
I'll take it from here, Kurt.
You can go. In fact, you all can go.

12:24.952 --> 12:28.372
I didn't mean for things to go this far.
I was just scared for my son.

12:28.456 --> 12:31.792
Whatever your reasoning is,
calls like that have consequences.

12:31.876 --> 12:33.127
Those guards have guns.

12:33.210 --> 12:36.213
-<i>The emergency has passed.</i>
-I know. I'm sorry.

12:36.797 --> 12:38.507
Maybe the Powered Wing isn't good for you.

12:39.175 --> 12:40.468
I'm sorry, Mom.

12:46.307 --> 12:49.560
-Fernando, I'm sorry if she scared you.
-I'm not scared of her, I…

12:53.272 --> 12:54.398
I think she's amazing.

12:57.193 --> 12:59.820
-Thank you for stepping in.
-Glad I was here.

13:00.321 --> 13:01.530
Janelle, what happened?

13:02.615 --> 13:03.824
I blew something up.

13:06.243 --> 13:10.039
Well, sometimes you've
got to blow stuff up.

13:10.664 --> 13:12.958
I mean, I know
<i>I </i>want to blow stuff up sometimes.

13:17.588 --> 13:18.672
Like right now.

13:27.848 --> 13:29.600
It felt good!

13:30.309 --> 13:31.435
Do you want to try?

13:58.420 --> 14:00.464
How do I feel? Like crap.

14:01.382 --> 14:05.010
I'm super fatigued, high fever,
headache, irritability.

14:05.719 --> 14:06.637
More than usual.

14:07.638 --> 14:09.723
Okay, and how long
have you been having symptoms?

14:09.807 --> 14:13.143
<i>Well, two days ago I was fine.</i>
<i>Then yesterday was a blur.</i>

14:13.686 --> 14:16.689
<i>Today, I woke up feeling</i>
<i>like I got run over by a Mack truck.</i>

14:17.523 --> 14:18.983
<i>And then there's this.</i>

14:24.572 --> 14:26.824
Can you lean in a bit closer, please?

14:30.160 --> 14:33.664
<i>You see those bumps? Looks like</i>
<i>there's something growing out of 'em.</i>

14:34.790 --> 14:37.751
My guess is that you have
some type of infection.

14:37.835 --> 14:40.671
The skin irritation
was likely caused by external stimuli.

14:40.754 --> 14:41.797
<i>Stimuli?</i>

14:41.881 --> 14:43.883
Something
that you came into contact with.

14:43.966 --> 14:44.800
It…

14:45.467 --> 14:49.388
It looks like it's gotten under your skin
and is causing a subdermal infection.

14:50.014 --> 14:52.182
Have you been in the woods, out in nature?

14:52.266 --> 14:55.394
I ride the Transit with a bunch
of animals, but… How do I fix it?

14:57.813 --> 14:58.647
What?

14:59.815 --> 15:01.025
Yeah, I'm working on it.

15:02.276 --> 15:03.736
It'll be done when it's done.

15:04.236 --> 15:06.155
Maybe you shouldn't be at work.

15:07.281 --> 15:10.326
You wanna pay my mortgage?
Are you gonna prescribe something or not?

15:11.201 --> 15:12.786
Sir, you need to go to urgent care.

15:12.870 --> 15:16.540
<i>I don't have time for urgent care.</i>
<i>Why do you think I'm calling this line?</i>

15:17.583 --> 15:18.584
<i>Useless!</i>

15:26.967 --> 15:28.302
You have a lot of cool stuff.

15:28.385 --> 15:31.180
Me and my mom painted in here
last summer when I turned ten.

15:32.306 --> 15:34.642
She let me pick out everything myself.

15:36.435 --> 15:38.062
My mom died when I was four.

15:41.023 --> 15:44.944
I can't imagine not having my mom.
Sometimes I can barely remember my dad.

15:45.611 --> 15:47.571
But he left us some videos.

15:49.657 --> 15:50.616
Let's go walk around.

15:50.699 --> 15:53.285
I'm not supposed to leave the house today.
I promised my mom.

15:53.369 --> 15:55.871
She's not here.
Your aunt's working.

15:55.955 --> 15:57.706
You could teleport out
and they won't know.

15:58.207 --> 16:00.084
She can track where I am on my phone.

16:00.626 --> 16:04.505
Then leave your phone here.
Put it on silent so she won't know.

16:06.715 --> 16:08.384
-If you're a chicken--
-I'm not.

16:15.432 --> 16:17.810
See that corner? Meet you there.

16:18.310 --> 16:21.146
I can teleport,
but how are you gonna get past my aunt?

16:21.230 --> 16:22.856
Don't worry about it. Just go.

17:15.868 --> 17:16.827
Hey, Brayden.

17:17.953 --> 17:18.787
You okay?

17:19.538 --> 17:20.497
I was never here.

17:20.581 --> 17:22.541
-You were never here.

17:29.173 --> 17:31.550
Don't be nervous. Okay?

17:32.051 --> 17:33.427
Because we're here for you.

17:34.344 --> 17:36.221
I'm gonna step outside with your mom.

17:36.764 --> 17:40.017
We'll leave you and Tevin
to just go crazy, like the Prince song.

17:42.686 --> 17:43.520
Prince?

17:45.856 --> 17:46.690
Really?

17:50.903 --> 17:52.780
-It hurts, don't it?
-Are we old?

17:53.322 --> 17:56.450
Janelle. This is a safe space.

17:56.992 --> 17:58.869
You're not gonna hurt me or yourself.

18:01.538 --> 18:04.166
And Tevin's a great coach. Dion loves him.

18:09.213 --> 18:10.464
I'll let you get to it.

18:18.305 --> 18:23.102
I appreciate what you're trying to do,
but none of this makes sense.

18:23.727 --> 18:25.771
There's no manual
for how to raise a Powered kid.

18:25.854 --> 18:27.773
I just want it to be over.

18:29.024 --> 18:30.776
The world is hard enough already.

18:31.944 --> 18:34.279
Coming to BIONA
was supposed to be better for her.

18:35.447 --> 18:38.408
-Were things rough back home?
-Off the rails.

18:38.492 --> 18:41.954
There was an explosion
in the science lab at her school.

18:43.831 --> 18:44.748
They arrested her.

18:44.832 --> 18:46.500
Okay, Janelle…

18:46.583 --> 18:47.417
My God.

18:48.001 --> 18:50.712
They put a 24-hour
psychiatric hold on her.

18:51.380 --> 18:52.673
Wouldn't let us see her.

18:53.841 --> 18:56.969
Fifteen-year-old girl, alone and scared.

18:57.678 --> 19:00.472
That's horrible. What did you do?

19:01.098 --> 19:02.349
I fought the system.

19:03.308 --> 19:04.476
Or I tried to.

19:05.394 --> 19:07.813
Didn't matter that Janelle
was an honors student.

19:09.189 --> 19:11.900
They'll just keep on
making their assumptions.

19:11.984 --> 19:13.569
Just like always.

19:14.695 --> 19:16.363
When I saw those guards with her,

19:17.948 --> 19:19.408
it all came flooding back.

19:20.075 --> 19:22.619
That should have never happened.

19:22.703 --> 19:26.039
I will talk to Suzanne about it
and bring it up with the Advisory Board.

19:26.123 --> 19:28.041
I'm… I'm so sorry.

19:28.750 --> 19:29.585
Thank you.

19:38.677 --> 19:42.014
-What were all those vans at school?
-Well, they were from BIONA.

19:42.097 --> 19:45.142
My dad used to work there.
Maybe they can help you with your powers.

19:45.225 --> 19:47.019
No. You can't tell them about me.

19:47.936 --> 19:48.770
Okay.

19:49.980 --> 19:51.064
Why were they at school?

19:51.565 --> 19:55.402
Well, they were at the sinkhole.
The one we're not allowed to play by.

19:55.485 --> 19:58.530
Well, something happened there
a couple of years ago. A fight.

19:59.406 --> 20:01.742
-What kind of fight?
-I don't want to talk about it.

20:03.368 --> 20:04.745
You had to fight Pat?

20:07.664 --> 20:09.041
What's a Crooked Man?

20:10.042 --> 20:11.752
I told you not to read my mind!

20:16.256 --> 20:17.507
A lightning monster?

20:20.219 --> 20:21.178
Daddy!

20:24.681 --> 20:27.226
-Where's Pat now?
-Locked up at BIONA.

20:27.726 --> 20:31.188
He used to be my friend, but he turned
into the Crooked Man and did bad things.

20:31.813 --> 20:35.025
He killed my dad, attacked me and my mom,
and killed my friend Charlotte.

20:35.108 --> 20:37.402
-Charlotte Tuck?
-You knew Charlotte?

20:38.237 --> 20:42.616
She came to visit me on our farm once,
after the Crooked Man killed my dad.

20:42.699 --> 20:43.909
He killed your dad?

20:45.285 --> 20:46.578
Because he had powers.

20:46.662 --> 20:48.872
He could grow anything
as fast as he wanted.

20:49.873 --> 20:50.832
Like that tomato.

20:51.917 --> 20:54.795
He'd fix things on the farm
using his powers,

20:54.878 --> 20:57.172
but his powers couldn't fix my mom
after she got sick.

21:02.803 --> 21:03.804
Let's go.

21:04.972 --> 21:07.224
Those guys are always
picking on younger kids.

21:07.891 --> 21:10.727
They won't pick on us.

21:13.480 --> 21:15.941
Well, well, look at the kindergartners
out on a walk.

21:16.024 --> 21:19.361
We're fifth-graders. It's not nice
to pick on people smaller than you.

21:19.444 --> 21:21.280
-You gonna go cry to Mommy?
-No.

21:22.406 --> 21:25.075
And he's not gonna let you
pick on anyone anymore.

21:25.909 --> 21:27.202
How's he gonna stop me?

21:27.703 --> 21:29.329
-<i>Show him.</i>

21:30.539 --> 21:31.915
What are you gonna do, huh?

21:33.542 --> 21:34.543
<i>Do it.</i>

21:45.178 --> 21:47.597
Hey. How'd you do that?

21:53.562 --> 21:54.730
-Ah!

22:01.069 --> 22:02.446
Get away from me!

22:02.529 --> 22:04.698
-Get off!

22:30.974 --> 22:34.895
I… I swear I didn't know. I thought
the Crooked Man was gone forever.

22:35.395 --> 22:38.315
Well, he's not.
And a piece of him is still in you.

22:38.398 --> 22:40.233
And now all this stuff is happening.

22:40.942 --> 22:45.113
I… I came back because
it was happening. To help BIONA stop it.

22:46.448 --> 22:50.077
Not that being stuck in a cell
in L5 is helping anyone.

22:50.160 --> 22:51.244
Well, it's helping me.

22:54.831 --> 22:58.502
As far as the world was concerned,
Pat Rollins was dead.

22:59.336 --> 23:00.504
I came back to help,

23:00.587 --> 23:04.174
and maybe you and me together can stop
whatever terrible thing is out there.

23:04.257 --> 23:05.342
For… For Dion's sake.

23:05.425 --> 23:06.510
Don't say his name.

23:07.427 --> 23:09.763
Once this is over,
you go back to being dead,

23:10.972 --> 23:12.224
and far away from here.

23:16.478 --> 23:21.566
So, this crooked energy thing that you saw
and the sinkhole, how is it all connected?

23:23.235 --> 23:24.486
Well…

23:26.113 --> 23:30.700
The dark energy that left me is out there

23:30.784 --> 23:32.744
and I still have a-a piece of it.

23:32.828 --> 23:35.747
But whatever killed that guy
in the parking lot,

23:35.831 --> 23:39.918
whatever brought the sinkhole to life,
that has a-a much bigger piece.

23:40.001 --> 23:41.002
So,

23:42.129 --> 23:44.047
something or someone

23:44.131 --> 23:48.343
has all the bad stuff
that used to be inside of you?

23:52.514 --> 23:53.765
Another Crooked Man.

23:54.975 --> 23:56.726
Potentially way worse.

23:58.645 --> 24:04.860
When I touched the soil at the sinkhole,
I could feel the anger and hatred

24:04.943 --> 24:06.361
festering down there.

24:07.612 --> 24:12.742
Old grievances that were never resolved
and that just went underground.

24:16.288 --> 24:19.166
Dion said a Civil War battle
took place there.

24:20.417 --> 24:22.210
Oh, that's, um…

24:24.254 --> 24:25.255
That's terrifying.

24:26.423 --> 24:29.968
The dark energy takes
the worst part of you and empowers it.

24:31.011 --> 24:33.054
That's what it did… to me.

24:34.848 --> 24:38.143
Imagine what it could do
with all the hate buried in that soil.

24:44.733 --> 24:46.610
Those bullies
won't bother you anymore.

24:46.693 --> 24:50.614
Yeah. I was like, "Tree branch.
Whack! You want some of this?"

24:50.697 --> 24:53.200
-Felt good to hit 'em, didn't it?
-It felt great.

24:54.201 --> 24:58.038
You can get back at anybody who's ever
picked on you or hurt somebody you love.

24:58.121 --> 25:01.249
Like Mr. Campbell. Or one
of my mom's clients who didn't pay her.

25:01.333 --> 25:02.167
Or Pat.

25:03.043 --> 25:06.129
You could go to that BIONA place
and hurt Pat like he hurt us.

25:06.963 --> 25:09.216
I'm not supposed to use my powers
to hurt people.

25:09.716 --> 25:10.717
It's not right.

25:10.800 --> 25:13.428
Why not? Those bullies deserved it.

25:13.512 --> 25:15.263
And Pat deserves way worse.

25:15.347 --> 25:17.516
"With great power
comes great responsibility."

25:18.266 --> 25:19.226
Huh?

25:19.893 --> 25:22.312
Dude, that's like Spider-Man basics!

25:23.772 --> 25:25.398
We have the power, Dion.

25:26.274 --> 25:28.443
We get to decide
what's right and what's wrong.

25:49.756 --> 25:50.882
What was that?

25:52.175 --> 25:53.093
Did you kill it?

25:55.428 --> 25:57.639
No. I turned its mind off.

25:58.765 --> 25:59.599
How?

25:59.683 --> 26:03.395
You use your mind to move things.
I use my mind to control things.

26:10.735 --> 26:11.570
Um…

26:12.112 --> 26:15.448
I probably should get home
before my aunt knows I'm gone.

26:15.532 --> 26:17.075
You don't have to go home.

26:17.158 --> 26:19.494
You could go to a candy store
or an arcade.

26:20.161 --> 26:23.707
I never pay for anything.
I just make people give me stuff.

26:24.541 --> 26:25.959
We can do whatever we want.

26:31.715 --> 26:35.218
If the energy is amassing in Atlanta,
then how do we stop it?

26:35.844 --> 26:39.222
Maybe we can turn
the science that created it against it.

26:40.515 --> 26:41.349
Meaning?

26:44.477 --> 26:49.482
Everybody else got good stuff in Iceland.
I only got the bad.

26:50.567 --> 26:51.943
It was killing me.

26:52.027 --> 26:57.073
The only thing that made me feel better
was… consuming Powered people.

26:57.157 --> 27:01.077
And their good energy quieted the bad.

27:01.870 --> 27:04.539
At… You know, at least for a little while.

27:04.623 --> 27:07.500
Yeah, you thought
killing Dion could cure you.

27:12.130 --> 27:13.840
Dion's special.

27:15.258 --> 27:19.638
More powerful than any of them, but…
But also, he was…

27:21.848 --> 27:23.516
-What?

27:27.103 --> 27:28.938
An… An answer to me.

27:29.814 --> 27:30.690
My opposite.

27:32.275 --> 27:33.860
How? Why?

27:33.943 --> 27:37.739
I… I can only tell you how it felt.

27:39.908 --> 27:43.119
Dion was born from you
and from the great Mark Warren,

27:43.203 --> 27:46.456
and the two of you were so in love, and

27:47.624 --> 27:50.418
I was unhappy and jealous.

27:51.252 --> 27:54.464
I felt I never got what I deserved,
which was everything.

27:54.547 --> 27:56.007
And Dion just was

27:57.384 --> 27:58.593
pure goodness, and I…

28:00.303 --> 28:01.221
I wanted that.

28:06.851 --> 28:10.188
But I-I don't feel like that now,
and I-I just…

28:10.271 --> 28:12.649
I wanna figure out how to help.

28:12.732 --> 28:18.697
So what if we could use Powered people
to counteract whatever bad is out there?

28:20.657 --> 28:23.702
-Maybe Dion could--
-You're not getting near my son.

28:23.785 --> 28:26.371
No, sorry. Okay.
I'm not talking about Dion himself.

28:26.454 --> 28:29.833
I'm talking about… his-his powers.

28:32.043 --> 28:32.877
His DNA.

28:34.754 --> 28:37.716
Mark studied his DNA
to try and learn more about his powers.

28:37.799 --> 28:41.344
Yeah. So can you imagine the possibilities
if we could bottle powers?

28:41.428 --> 28:44.973
I mean, the right cocktail
of Powered DNA can cure anything.

28:45.056 --> 28:49.102
I mean, it's good versus bad.
It's classic comic book stuff.

28:50.228 --> 28:52.230
I mean, it could keep Dion safe.

28:53.732 --> 28:54.566
Yeah.

28:55.775 --> 28:57.277
It could keep everybody safe.

29:03.950 --> 29:06.161
-Whoa. Oh my… Are you okay?

29:14.419 --> 29:18.298
-Oh, uh, okay. Your arm is bleeding.
-I'm fine.

29:18.798 --> 29:20.675
Okay. You don't look fine.

29:20.759 --> 29:24.179
I… was attacked by someone.

29:24.763 --> 29:27.640
Something. I don't know. At the sinkhole.

29:29.058 --> 29:29.893
Can I see it?

29:35.899 --> 29:37.859
Oh, gosh, Nicole.

29:39.861 --> 29:41.696
-Whoa.
-What's happening?

29:41.780 --> 29:42.906
It's reacting.

29:44.032 --> 29:46.701
To me.
Or to the electrical charge inside me.

29:46.785 --> 29:48.661
My God. It feels
like it's alive under my skin.

29:49.746 --> 29:51.915
-Oh my God. Uh…
-What does that mean?

29:51.998 --> 29:56.920
Whatever bad was in that sinkhole,
whatever bad is still inside me--

29:57.003 --> 29:58.463
Is inside <i>me </i>now.

30:03.510 --> 30:05.094
Dion, wait!

30:05.178 --> 30:07.597
I have to get home.
I'm gonna get in trouble.

30:07.680 --> 30:11.601
My aunt's gonna be worried and someone's
gonna wonder where you are too.

30:11.684 --> 30:13.561
No, they won't. I don't have anyone.

30:14.604 --> 30:15.814
You still have your mom.

30:17.148 --> 30:19.692
-I'm sorry if the dog thing scared you.
-It did scare me.

30:20.902 --> 30:22.195
I don't like you reading my mind,

30:22.278 --> 30:24.447
and you want me
to do bad stuff with my powers.

30:24.531 --> 30:26.282
You don't want to be friends?

30:26.366 --> 30:29.869
I didn't say that, but I just don't…

30:30.829 --> 30:33.998
I just don't wanna lie to my mom anymore,
or the Triangle of Justice.

30:34.082 --> 30:36.668
-Stop calling them that. It's stupid.
-No, it's not!

30:37.168 --> 30:40.296
We're alike, you and me.
No one else understands us.

30:40.380 --> 30:41.840
I want to go home!

30:41.923 --> 30:45.218
I'll deal with your aunt.
I can turn her off too, like the dog!

30:47.846 --> 30:50.056
Dion! Get over here now!

30:51.891 --> 30:53.184
Leave her alone!

30:57.814 --> 31:01.776
-Why did you leave the house?
-Ugh. I'm sorry. Can we just please drive?

31:01.860 --> 31:03.945
You're just wandering
the streets by yourself?

31:04.028 --> 31:05.363
I was with Brayden.

31:05.446 --> 31:06.656
Who?

31:10.994 --> 31:13.288
Never mind. Just can we please drive?

31:15.415 --> 31:16.624
I guess I fell asleep.

31:17.959 --> 31:19.836
We're not gonna bother your mom with this.

31:33.808 --> 31:35.560
So far, your labs are inconclusive.

31:38.730 --> 31:41.649
-We'll figure out what it is.
-Any changes at the sinkhole?

31:41.733 --> 31:44.485
Readings have come down again.
No sign of the thing we saw down there.

31:44.569 --> 31:45.445
Can you sign?

31:45.528 --> 31:47.530
-You think you destroyed it?
-Seems like.

31:48.823 --> 31:51.367
We'll make sure it's safe
before they reopen the school.

31:52.410 --> 31:55.288
Right now, our focus
is on getting you better.

31:57.582 --> 32:01.294
Well, Pat theorized
that Powered people's DNA

32:01.377 --> 32:04.047
might be the cure to whatever
is coursing through my veins.

32:05.256 --> 32:06.883
And whatever else bad is out there.

32:06.966 --> 32:09.802
Interesting theory.
I'll talk to our team about it.

32:11.679 --> 32:13.514
I think we need Pat.

32:14.432 --> 32:15.266
What?

32:16.225 --> 32:20.229
This rash, it reacted to Pat.

32:20.897 --> 32:23.358
It was excited by his energy.

32:23.900 --> 32:25.526
And the sinkhole reacted to Pat.

32:26.194 --> 32:29.572
He said he could feel what it felt,
like he knew what it wanted.

32:30.615 --> 32:33.326
I think Pat could be
the key to stopping all of this.

32:33.409 --> 32:35.954
He's an engineer. He's not a scientist.

32:36.037 --> 32:39.415
He was studying how to use powers
to cure himself two years ago.

32:40.041 --> 32:43.169
And he knows Mark's research
backwards and forwards.

32:43.670 --> 32:45.755
If he had access to your Powered DNA lab--

32:45.838 --> 32:47.090
Let him out of his cell?

32:48.049 --> 32:49.676
Under heavy guard.

32:51.010 --> 32:53.721
I mean, there's
something terrible out there,

32:53.805 --> 32:58.017
and there's something terrible in me.
I can feel it. It's alive and growing.

32:59.185 --> 33:00.436
Pat was the Crooked Man.

33:01.521 --> 33:02.480
He understands it.

33:03.314 --> 33:05.984
And you trust
that he actually wants to help us?

33:06.609 --> 33:07.443
No.

33:09.195 --> 33:10.780
But I'm not sure we have a choice.

33:24.460 --> 33:25.753
How you feeling?

33:26.754 --> 33:29.007
Super tired, weak,

33:30.133 --> 33:31.175
a little pissed off.

33:32.677 --> 33:35.596
Well, whatever malady you've got
don't know who it's messing with.

33:36.097 --> 33:39.684
-The way you handled those BIONA guards.
-Thank you for helping with Janelle.

33:39.767 --> 33:42.687
Yeah. I'm just glad
you're not throwing something at me.

33:43.813 --> 33:47.567
-Do you mind if we sit for a second?
-Yeah. Do you need anything? Water?

33:48.818 --> 33:49.861
No, I'm okay.

33:51.738 --> 33:52.572
Hmm.

33:57.577 --> 34:00.288
I don't know much about you
from your life before this.

34:01.664 --> 34:02.790
Probably a good thing.

34:05.084 --> 34:08.755
BIONA helped me get refocused,
which is something I definitely needed.

34:10.757 --> 34:13.176
Let's just say
you caught me at an upswing in my life.

34:14.177 --> 34:15.219
Well, lucky me.

34:15.303 --> 34:17.430
Nah, I'm the lucky one.

34:24.771 --> 34:25.980
So, um,

34:27.648 --> 34:28.483
I was…

34:29.400 --> 34:30.735
I was gonna see if

34:32.153 --> 34:34.155
you maybe wanted to go get that dinner?

34:36.657 --> 34:39.619
I have to stay here tonight.
In the medical unit.

34:39.702 --> 34:42.371
They just want to keep an eye on me
and make sure everything's okay.

34:43.206 --> 34:46.876
All right. Then I'm staying.
I'm keeping you company.

34:46.959 --> 34:48.795
You don't have to do that.

34:48.878 --> 34:49.712
I know.

34:50.463 --> 34:51.297
But I want to.

34:55.218 --> 34:57.011
So, food. What are we thinking?

34:57.887 --> 34:59.722
Tacos, uh…

35:01.933 --> 35:02.850
Whatever you want.

35:04.102 --> 35:04.977
Actually…

35:08.481 --> 35:10.191
I need to ask you for a favor.

35:14.278 --> 35:17.156
-<i>How was your day with Brayden?</i>
-I don't know.

35:17.240 --> 35:20.243
I thought we had stuff in common,
but he's kind of weird.

35:20.326 --> 35:21.828
<i>Weird? How?</i>

35:22.370 --> 35:25.331
No, he's… Never mind. He's okay.

35:26.624 --> 35:27.875
When are you coming home?

35:28.376 --> 35:30.002
<i>I can't make it back tonight.</i>

35:30.670 --> 35:34.465
<i>Uh, things at BIONA</i>
<i>are more complicated than we thought.</i>

35:35.758 --> 35:38.386
But you've never been gone
for work overnight before.

35:38.469 --> 35:41.347
<i>I know,</i>
<i>but I've got a surprise for you.</i>

35:42.849 --> 35:44.809
Auntie Kat's gonna
take you out to the cabin!

35:44.892 --> 35:49.105
<i>And Tevin's going.</i>
<i>You guys can train out in the real world.</i>

35:49.188 --> 35:50.940
<i>Awesome! Can you come?</i>

35:51.899 --> 35:55.486
I can't make it this time,
but when we go to the cabin,

35:55.570 --> 36:00.533
we'll go for a few days, sleep outside
and look at the constellations.

36:00.616 --> 36:02.618
<i>With Dad's telescope?</i>
-Mm-hmm.

36:03.536 --> 36:04.453
Definitely.

36:07.999 --> 36:10.543
Esperanza sent me this really funny video.
Want to see it?

36:10.626 --> 36:11.627
Mm-hmm, definitely.

36:32.148 --> 36:33.024
Wow.

36:38.988 --> 36:41.407
A lot's changed at BIONA
since you worked here.

36:41.991 --> 36:43.034
The world's changed.

36:43.618 --> 36:47.079
So this is all Powered people's DNA
and blood samples and data?

36:47.163 --> 36:48.039
Mm-hmm.

36:50.791 --> 36:52.501
We both want Nicole to get better.

36:53.920 --> 36:55.504
You said you came back to help?

36:57.632 --> 36:59.217
Here's your chance.

37:06.349 --> 37:07.183
Hey, Glen.

37:11.896 --> 37:12.980
You wanted to see me?

37:14.232 --> 37:15.233
I, um…

37:16.817 --> 37:19.528
I got a call from Cutler on your behalf.

37:22.198 --> 37:25.493
He seems very invested
in having you remain in BIONA.

37:27.370 --> 37:30.873
We can do this together, Suzanne.
I know how to deal with Cutler.

37:31.540 --> 37:33.668
Sink out of your skis a little
on this one.

37:33.751 --> 37:35.127
Let me help you.

37:35.211 --> 37:36.379
I don't need your help.

37:36.879 --> 37:39.090
Unless you wouldn't mind
removing your knife from my back.

37:40.383 --> 37:41.634
Now you're getting dramatic.

37:41.717 --> 37:45.012
-Look, he's more comfortable with me.
-I wonder why that is.

37:45.596 --> 37:48.307
I helped build this company,

37:48.391 --> 37:51.060
and you come in here
bro-ing it up with Cutler,

37:51.143 --> 37:53.312
positioning yourself as my partner.

37:53.396 --> 37:56.023
You're not my partner, David.
You never were.

37:58.526 --> 38:01.904
You know, that chip on your shoulder,
it's not doing you any favors.

38:03.114 --> 38:06.534
Well, let me guess.
I'd be so much prettier if I just smiled.

38:33.853 --> 38:36.564
<i>Dion is not your friend.</i>

38:37.356 --> 38:39.775
<i>I am your only friend.</i>

38:41.610 --> 38:43.070
You killed my dad.

38:43.154 --> 38:46.907
<i>Pat killed your dad</i>
<i>because Pat was weak.</i>

38:48.993 --> 38:51.996
<i>Do you want to be weak like Pat?</i>

38:53.080 --> 38:53.914
No.

38:53.998 --> 38:58.711
<i>As long as you are with me,</i>
<i>no one can hurt you.</i>

38:59.253 --> 39:02.214
<i>Except for Dion.</i>

39:03.632 --> 39:06.177
<i>He can destroy us both.</i>

39:07.386 --> 39:08.804
<i>He abandoned you.</i>

39:10.723 --> 39:16.395
<i>He doesn't need you,</i>
<i>because he has everything.</i>

39:16.479 --> 39:20.232
<i>And you have nothing.</i>

39:22.234 --> 39:23.861
<i>No one,</i>

39:24.779 --> 39:26.530
<i>except for me.</i>

39:27.490 --> 39:33.454
<i>When I'm strong enough,</i>
<i>we will destroy Dion together</i>

39:33.537 --> 39:36.874
<i>and you will have everything.</i>

40:05.861 --> 40:06.695
I don't know.

40:07.321 --> 40:09.782
I'm meeting a client for a drink
and I'm already late.

40:14.370 --> 40:15.871
-Here you go. Thank you.
-Thanks.

40:20.876 --> 40:22.336
-Watch out.
-I gotta go.

40:33.889 --> 40:34.723
Ow!

40:35.975 --> 40:36.809
Oh, gosh.
