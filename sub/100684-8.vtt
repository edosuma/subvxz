12:19.086 --> 12:20.827
All right, bet.

12:20.870 --> 12:24.308
JONES:Mr. Bell, the nightof the murder,

12:24.352 --> 12:25.745
you claim you wereworking late.

12:25.788 --> 12:29.096
Can you tell us exactly
what you were doing?

12:29.139 --> 12:31.925
Oh, God.
[scoffs]

12:31.968 --> 12:33.361
Is this relevant?

12:33.404 --> 12:36.494
Well, you claim it's your alibi,so, yeah.

12:36.538 --> 12:38.496
[sighs]

12:38.540 --> 12:40.411
Okay.

12:40.455 --> 12:41.848
Fine.

12:41.891 --> 12:45.852
Basically, I was
working late, and...

12:45.895 --> 12:49.594
I went across the street
to a Peruvian buffet.

12:49.638 --> 12:52.989
There was a questionable-lookinglomo saltado,

12:53.033 --> 12:55.557
but I got it anyway.

12:55.600 --> 12:57.602
And it did not...

12:59.561 --> 13:01.606
...sit well will with me.

13:05.045 --> 13:07.264
Do I have to go on?Yeah.

13:07.308 --> 13:10.093
I was on the toilet
for two hours, okay?

13:10.137 --> 13:13.096
I can't even describe to you
what came out of me,

13:13.140 --> 13:16.012
but it was... otherworldly.

13:16.056 --> 13:19.320
So, yeah,
that's what I was doing.

13:19.363 --> 13:21.452
[taps table]Diarrhea.

13:23.237 --> 13:26.762
Okay. Well,that explains that, then.

13:28.895 --> 13:30.722
Wait. Really?Yeah.

13:30.766 --> 13:32.246
It's a solid alibi.

13:32.289 --> 13:34.291
Well... [chuckles]

13:36.163 --> 13:38.513
Thank you both for your time.

13:38.556 --> 13:40.036
MILLER:Whoa-whoa-whoa. Excuse me.

13:40.080 --> 13:41.908
Where do you thinkyou're going?

13:41.951 --> 13:43.823
You may have an alibi
for the murder, but...

13:43.866 --> 13:46.434
you obviously trespassedinto the van.

13:46.477 --> 13:48.436
That's true. I did.

13:48.479 --> 13:51.439
I snuck into an
evidentiary vehicle

13:51.482 --> 13:55.573
that you guys failed
to properly secure.

13:55.617 --> 13:58.925
So, if you charge me, your
one piece of evidence--

13:58.968 --> 14:01.753
the van in question--
gets thrown out in court

14:01.797 --> 14:03.712
due to the fact that
I tampered with it.

14:03.755 --> 14:07.020
And your whole case
would be null and void.

14:07.063 --> 14:09.370
But by all means,
if you want to keep me here

14:09.413 --> 14:11.415
for merely trespassing,
be my guest.

14:13.374 --> 14:15.506
[laughter]What's going on?

14:15.550 --> 14:17.117
Oh, you didn't hear?

14:17.160 --> 14:19.554
Jones and Miller lost
their prime suspect

14:19.597 --> 14:20.903
because he was pooping.

14:20.947 --> 14:22.339
Great.

14:22.383 --> 14:23.514
Oh, my God!
It's the video!

14:23.558 --> 14:24.820
No. We have actual...

14:24.864 --> 14:26.256
Look at that.Perfect.

14:26.300 --> 14:28.780
[quiet laughter]

14:28.824 --> 14:31.000
[sighs]

14:32.872 --> 14:34.351
Whose case is this?

14:34.395 --> 14:35.657
Mine.

14:35.700 --> 14:36.658
Is that Felix Bell?

14:36.701 --> 14:38.007
Yeah. You know him?

14:38.051 --> 14:39.574
You release him yet?

14:39.617 --> 14:42.664
Not yet. Still got six hours
before I got to let him go.

14:42.707 --> 14:45.232
Just let him sit there,
the little dweeb.

14:45.275 --> 14:47.451
Mind if I take a crack at him?

14:47.495 --> 14:49.497
Please.Be my guest.

14:50.585 --> 14:52.630
[chuckles] Okay.

14:52.674 --> 14:53.631
[door opens]

14:53.675 --> 14:55.198
DEAN:Felix.

14:55.242 --> 14:56.852
Uh...

14:56.896 --> 14:59.637
Hi.
So...

14:59.681 --> 15:01.509
want to tell me
what you were really doing

15:01.552 --> 15:03.076
in the grooming truck that day?

15:05.252 --> 15:07.254
Uh...

15:11.780 --> 15:13.738
[dog barking in distance]

15:13.782 --> 15:15.566
[indistinct chatter]

15:18.656 --> 15:20.267
[distant horn blaring]

15:20.310 --> 15:22.312
Okay, I see it.

15:32.322 --> 15:34.455
Hi. We're, um...
we're Ben's friends.

15:34.498 --> 15:35.717
Get in.

15:40.678 --> 15:42.854
How much do you need?

15:42.898 --> 15:45.727
Um, six... [clears throat]

15:45.770 --> 15:47.033
Six bundles.

15:47.076 --> 15:50.253
Six? I got
four on me.

15:50.297 --> 15:52.342
I'll give you everything
for a grand.

15:52.386 --> 15:54.954
Okay. Um... that's fine.

15:54.997 --> 15:57.130
When will youhave more?

15:57.173 --> 15:59.654
Next week. I'll text you.

15:59.697 --> 16:02.222
Um... okay.

16:02.265 --> 16:05.399
Yeah, here's a grand,thank you.

16:18.107 --> 16:20.196
DEAN:Felix, for the last time,why were you in the van?

16:22.372 --> 16:24.766
I had to get something
off the truck.

16:24.809 --> 16:27.334
That's why I snuck on.

16:27.377 --> 16:29.379
Getting something
for Max?

16:34.341 --> 16:35.429
No.

16:38.432 --> 16:39.868
It was mushrooms.

16:41.217 --> 16:43.045
Mushrooms?Yes.

16:43.089 --> 16:44.481
I was going through
a hard time,

16:44.525 --> 16:46.309
and I just wanted
to clear my head,

16:46.353 --> 16:48.007
so I bought
some shrooms.

16:48.050 --> 16:50.574
And I hid them on the truck,
then you guys took the truck,

16:50.618 --> 16:51.793
and I freaked out.

16:51.836 --> 16:53.360
Then Murphy convinced
me to sneak in,

16:53.403 --> 16:55.275
and I just thought,
okay, well, you know,

16:55.318 --> 16:57.059
trespassing is a
class B misdemeanor,

16:57.103 --> 16:58.495
but possession of a
controlled substance

16:58.539 --> 17:00.367
is a class one felony, so...

17:00.410 --> 17:02.586
I thought I'd just
play my odds.

17:02.630 --> 17:04.980
But we frisked you.
We checked your bags.

17:05.024 --> 17:06.373
We didn't see any mushrooms.

17:06.416 --> 17:08.070
We ate them.

17:08.114 --> 17:10.116
Murphy and I.GENE:You do realize

17:10.159 --> 17:12.509
we could just arrest youfor trespassing, though, right?

17:12.553 --> 17:13.902
Yeah.

17:13.945 --> 17:16.296
Didn't your colleagues
tell you about that?

17:16.339 --> 17:19.690
If you arrest me, then you get
two cases thrown out--

17:19.734 --> 17:22.563
the Jeremy Davis murderand the Max Parish case-- so...

17:26.480 --> 17:28.482
Gene, go get his stuff.

17:34.749 --> 17:36.751
[sighs]

17:48.763 --> 17:51.026
[engine rattling]

17:51.070 --> 17:53.724
[alert beeping]

17:53.768 --> 17:55.422
Why are we stopping?Hold on.

18:01.297 --> 18:03.386
I... I think I ran out of gas.

18:04.474 --> 18:06.476
You ran out of gas?Yes.

18:07.695 --> 18:10.872
I have to be at the women's
prison in, like, an hour.

18:12.700 --> 18:14.658
[sighs]
How could you let this happen?

18:14.702 --> 18:16.051
How could I
let this happen?

18:16.095 --> 18:18.097
Well, I would...Oh, my God!

18:20.099 --> 18:21.535
Where are you going?

18:21.578 --> 18:24.103
There was a gas station,like, a mile ago.

18:25.408 --> 18:27.715
Jess, you can't also
blame this on me.

18:28.803 --> 18:30.892
You're the onewho can see the gas gauge.

18:33.416 --> 18:35.288
I'm sorry!

18:35.331 --> 18:37.986
I'm sorry I didn't tell youabout the drugs!

18:38.029 --> 18:39.857
I was tryingto be a good friend!

18:39.901 --> 18:42.382
No, you were not!

18:42.425 --> 18:43.557
Do you not get it, Murph?!

18:43.600 --> 18:46.647
We're not good friends
to each other!

18:46.690 --> 18:48.649
We don't know how to be!

18:48.692 --> 18:50.520
What is thatsupposed to mean?

18:50.564 --> 18:54.263
It means that this...
this is not a friendship.

18:54.307 --> 18:56.483
This is...

18:56.526 --> 18:59.964
one giant, codependent mess.

19:00.008 --> 19:02.576
So you and I are a mess now?

19:02.619 --> 19:04.099
Yeah.

19:04.143 --> 19:07.537
Do you not understand the
loop that we're in, Murphy?

19:07.581 --> 19:09.757
If you don't, let me
explain it to you.

19:09.800 --> 19:13.021
You screw up, and then I dosomething even dumber to fix it,

19:13.064 --> 19:17.373
and then I blame you,
and then you apologize.

19:17.417 --> 19:19.593
That's what we've been
doing since we were 14.

19:22.944 --> 19:24.946
I mean, where are we?

19:26.730 --> 19:28.732
We're drug dealers, Murphy.

19:28.776 --> 19:32.127
Drug... dealers.

19:32.171 --> 19:33.389
'Cause, obviously,

19:33.433 --> 19:35.522
that was the natural conclusionof all of this.

19:35.565 --> 19:36.871
We're literally trapped.

19:38.438 --> 19:40.657
I'm really sorry you're trappedin a friendship with me.

19:40.701 --> 19:42.442
You're trapped
with me, too.

19:43.834 --> 19:45.488
I'm a bad friend.

19:45.532 --> 19:47.577
Yeah, I am.

19:49.927 --> 19:52.103
I got off on the fact

19:52.147 --> 19:55.759
that I was the only person
that you would let help you.

19:57.761 --> 20:02.636
It gave me this disgusting
sense of purpose.

20:02.679 --> 20:04.942
[sighs heavily]

20:04.986 --> 20:06.988
Murphy, you do
not need saving.

20:08.424 --> 20:12.820
And you most certainly do not
need me taking care of you.

20:14.256 --> 20:16.215
But the scary thing is,
is I don't...

20:16.258 --> 20:19.218
I don't really underst...

20:19.261 --> 20:22.221
I don't understand who we are
with... without that, so...

20:25.746 --> 20:27.313
So?

20:31.099 --> 20:33.101
I'm gonna go get the gas.

20:36.757 --> 20:39.107
Jess.

20:40.369 --> 20:41.370
[laughter
and indistinct chatter]

20:41.414 --> 20:43.285
What's a hypotenuse?

20:43.329 --> 20:45.722
Why do I have to knowwhat a hypotenuse is?

20:45.766 --> 20:47.724
Like, when in my lifewill anyone be like,

20:47.768 --> 20:49.770
"Hey, what's a hypotenuse?"

20:51.119 --> 20:53.339
Hello? Chloe?

20:53.382 --> 20:55.471
What's up?
You're acting so weird today.

20:56.516 --> 20:59.040
Sorry. It's my dad.

20:59.083 --> 21:01.216
Well, not my dad.

21:01.260 --> 21:02.957
This girl he dated.

21:03.000 --> 21:04.437
The blind one?

21:04.480 --> 21:07.396
Yeah. She said all this stuff
about him that just...

21:07.440 --> 21:09.398
[sighs]
It was bad.

21:09.442 --> 21:12.271
Well, she sucks, then.

21:14.360 --> 21:17.276
'Kay, like, I know your dad
is strict or whatever.

21:17.319 --> 21:20.409
I mean, he still hasn'tgiven you back your phone.

21:20.453 --> 21:21.410
But, like...

21:21.454 --> 21:23.325
he's sort of a catch.

21:23.369 --> 21:25.284
Shut up.[chuckles]

21:25.327 --> 21:26.502
I'm serious.

21:26.546 --> 21:27.851
He's a cop.

21:27.895 --> 21:29.200
He's pretty cute.

21:29.244 --> 21:32.116
Gross, Amber![laughs]

21:42.213 --> 21:43.998
[exhales]

21:44.041 --> 21:46.392
What is taking him so long?

21:46.435 --> 21:47.436
I don't know.

21:50.396 --> 21:53.573
Dean, talk to you real quick?

21:56.053 --> 21:58.360
So, I went back
for Felix's stuff.

21:58.404 --> 21:59.535
Look what I found.

22:00.623 --> 22:02.364
What am I looking at?

22:02.408 --> 22:04.192
It's the Heart of Virtue, man.

22:04.235 --> 22:06.412
Adult words, please.

22:06.455 --> 22:08.065
It's the symbolfor the Klingon Empire.

22:08.109 --> 22:10.416
Remember that note that had thedrop point for Nia's connect?

22:10.459 --> 22:11.634
It was written in Klingon.

22:11.678 --> 22:14.463
Look at the Esin Felix's statement.

22:14.507 --> 22:17.379
It's the exact samehandwriting.

22:17.423 --> 22:19.555
You think Felix did the drop?

22:19.599 --> 22:21.383
That's what I think, man.

22:21.427 --> 22:23.907
Madge delivers to prisonsevery Thursday.

22:23.951 --> 22:26.519
The truck was impoundedon a Thursday.

22:28.172 --> 22:30.392
They were on their way to do a
drop when the truck was taken.

22:32.438 --> 22:34.135
He had drugson that truck,

22:34.178 --> 22:35.484
but it wasn't shrooms.
It was Nia's heroin.

22:35.528 --> 22:37.181
Yep.

22:38.269 --> 22:39.793
Murphy is in on this.

22:39.836 --> 22:41.447
She's in on all of it.

22:41.490 --> 22:43.405
She's been visiting Max
in prison.

22:43.449 --> 22:45.451
She is the new way in.

22:45.494 --> 22:47.844
Let's get the security footage
of her visits to Max.

22:47.888 --> 22:49.019
We are gonna get her.

22:49.063 --> 22:50.412
Let's get it.

22:51.674 --> 22:53.415
Ah, looks like
they're just talking.

22:53.459 --> 22:55.417
Shut up for a second.

22:56.679 --> 22:58.202
Look.

22:58.246 --> 22:59.813
Right there. She's giving him
something under the table.

22:59.856 --> 23:01.510
♪

23:08.038 --> 23:08.996
It's in the cane.

23:09.039 --> 23:11.520
♪

23:11.564 --> 23:12.739
It's in the damn cane.

23:15.568 --> 23:17.874
Murphy Mason is done.

23:23.793 --> 23:25.055
Now, we can't prove
from this tape

23:25.099 --> 23:26.056
that what she's
slipping him is heroin.

23:26.100 --> 23:27.231
DEAN:
No, we can't.

23:27.275 --> 23:28.581
That's why I'm gonna
catch her doing it.

23:28.624 --> 23:30.800
When does Parish
have visitation next?

23:30.844 --> 23:32.062
Uh...

23:34.064 --> 23:36.066
Today.
Well, tonight.

23:36.110 --> 23:38.242
But she just saw him yesterday,so...

23:38.286 --> 23:40.419
it'll probably be a few days
before she comes again.

23:40.462 --> 23:41.507
No, it won't.

23:41.550 --> 23:44.423
She can't stay away from him.

23:44.466 --> 23:46.468
Meantime, keep Felix Bell here.

23:46.512 --> 23:47.469
Can't risk him warning her.

23:47.513 --> 23:48.818
[sighs]
We can't, man.

23:48.862 --> 23:50.429
He's been held for 24 hours.

23:50.472 --> 23:51.734
