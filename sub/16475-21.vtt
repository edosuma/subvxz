WEBVTT

00:00.172 --> 00:03.178
Five, four, three, two, and step.

00:03.180 --> 00:05.448
And step, and knees around the world.

00:05.516 --> 00:06.750
Great form, Captain.

00:06.817 --> 00:08.651
Your calves are looking toit.

00:08.719 --> 00:10.420
Peralta, what're you
doing at Razzmatazz?

00:10.488 --> 00:12.322
We needed to talk somewhere
outside the precinct.

00:12.389 --> 00:13.590
Diaz? You are here too.

00:13.657 --> 00:15.325
- Great.
- Yeah.

00:15.392 --> 00:18.561
Sir, we've discovered that
Lieutenant Hawkins is dirty.

00:18.629 --> 00:21.564
Her squad isn't investigating
the Golden Gang bank robbers,

00:21.767 --> 00:22.867
they are the robbers.

00:22.935 --> 00:24.569
- Knees up in the back.
- Sorry, Brenda.

00:24.638 --> 00:25.938
If Hawkins is robbing banks,

00:26.005 --> 00:27.639
why did she invite you
onto her task force?

00:27.706 --> 00:30.775
And squat and hold and work those quads.

00:30.843 --> 00:32.476
We were working on a case
that could have exposed her.

00:32.543 --> 00:33.645
This way she can keep tabs on us.

00:33.712 --> 00:36.214
Turn it. Get down.

00:36.282 --> 00:37.715
God, why is this so hard for me?

00:37.783 --> 00:40.485
- Do I even have quads?
- And twirl.

00:40.552 --> 00:43.221
Normally, I'd say we'd report
this to Internal Affairs...

00:43.289 --> 00:45.623
- And twirl back.
- But Hawkins is one of

00:45.691 --> 00:48.559
the most revered detectives in the NYPD.

00:48.627 --> 00:50.995
- And hula hands.
- If you're gonna go after her,

00:51.063 --> 00:52.830
you'd better have the
proof to back it up.

00:52.898 --> 00:54.732
Well, then I guess that only
leaves us with one option.

00:54.800 --> 00:56.734
And now wag those tails.

00:56.802 --> 00:58.903
Find out everything we
can about the squad.

00:58.971 --> 01:00.838
and take her down from the inside.

01:00.906 --> 01:03.641
- Keep wagging back there.
- I am wagging, Brenda.

<i>Morning, Lieutenant Hawkins.</i>

01:25.731 --> 01:28.599
Hey, have you ever considered
going by Lady Hawk?

01:28.667 --> 01:30.635
Pretty sweet flick. Matty Broderick,

01:30.703 --> 01:33.037
Shelly Pfeiffer, Alf Molina.

01:33.105 --> 01:34.772
Not to be confused with Alf, Alf.

01:34.840 --> 01:36.341
- We all love him.
- What do you want?

01:36.408 --> 01:37.842
We ran background checks
on all the employees

01:37.910 --> 01:39.043
of the three banks that were hit.

01:39.111 --> 01:40.478
- Nothing interesting.
- Run checks

01:40.546 --> 01:41.879
on all the family members.

01:41.947 --> 01:43.281
Or we could get to
know each other better

01:43.349 --> 01:44.615
and join you in the field.

01:44.683 --> 01:46.317
Or you could run a background check.

01:46.385 --> 01:47.986
Lieutenant, the manager
of the Capital Trust Bank

01:48.053 --> 01:49.620
- in Fort Greene is here.
- Oh, yeah.

01:49.688 --> 01:50.955
- Was that bank even hit?
- We brought him in

01:51.023 --> 01:52.623
because we think it might
be the next target.

01:52.691 --> 01:53.658
Is that standard procedure?

01:53.726 --> 01:55.526
You ask a lot of questions.

01:55.594 --> 01:58.463
She really doesn't. One
time I broke my arm,

01:58.530 --> 01:59.797
and she didn't even
ask me what happened,

01:59.865 --> 02:03.468
and it was a really funny story.

02:03.535 --> 02:05.470
Wow, now nobody's asking what happened?

02:05.537 --> 02:06.704
This is insane.

02:06.772 --> 02:09.039
Okay, I should be back in an hour.

02:09.108 --> 02:10.842
If my desk phone rings, just ignore it.

02:10.908 --> 02:12.877
- I don't answer it anyway.
- You shouldn't tell me

02:12.945 --> 02:14.812
- stuff like that.
- Where's Gina going?

02:14.880 --> 02:16.681
That's, like, the third time
she's taken off this week.

02:16.749 --> 02:17.882
She has a doctor's appointment.

02:17.950 --> 02:19.317
You know what that's code for.

02:19.385 --> 02:20.685
She's taking a nap in the furnace room.

02:20.753 --> 02:22.086
Is that what you do?

02:22.154 --> 02:23.821
Because you really
should go to the doctor.

02:23.889 --> 02:25.323
When you breathe it sounds
like someone's shaking

02:25.391 --> 02:27.592
- a bag of quarters.
- You're right.

02:27.659 --> 02:29.660
I'll go to the doctor right now.

02:29.728 --> 02:31.662
Sarge, you think Gina will be okay?

02:31.730 --> 02:33.898
She says the doctor's can't be
sure, but they're optimistic.

02:33.967 --> 02:36.702
Apparently, she has something
called Ansel-Elgort Syndrome.

02:36.769 --> 02:37.835
- Oh, poor Gina.
- Oh, my God.

02:37.903 --> 02:39.504
Oh, you fools.

02:39.571 --> 02:42.073
That's not a disease.
Ansel Elgort's an actor.

02:42.141 --> 02:43.841
Did none of you see "The
Fault in Our Stars"?

02:43.909 --> 02:45.109
No. Why did you?

02:45.177 --> 02:47.011
Teenage romance, dying chick,

02:47.079 --> 02:48.413
oxygen mask.

02:48.480 --> 02:50.681
Checks all my boxes.

02:50.749 --> 02:52.617
So what's really going on with Gina?

02:52.684 --> 02:54.619
Wait. You don't think...

02:54.686 --> 02:56.354
That she hates work and
doesn't wanna be here?

02:56.422 --> 02:59.023
- Yeah, I do think.
- No, that she's pregnant.

02:59.091 --> 03:00.758
It all makes sense now.

03:00.826 --> 03:02.760
Last week, I brought in
unpasteurized boar's milk

03:02.828 --> 03:04.062
and she refused to drink any.

03:04.129 --> 03:06.030
Not a real convincing argument, Boyle.

03:06.098 --> 03:07.899
No, I think Charles might be right.

03:07.966 --> 03:09.734
Yesterday, I asked her
to go for a drink,

03:09.802 --> 03:11.869
and she said, "That
sounds like a nightmare."

03:11.937 --> 03:12.937
- Oh, Amy.
- Okay.

03:13.005 --> 03:14.372
Just give me this, please.

03:14.440 --> 03:15.573
I'd feel so much better about my self

03:15.641 --> 03:16.874
if it was because she was pregnant.

03:16.942 --> 03:20.445
Oh, my God, look what
Gina was working on.

03:20.512 --> 03:22.647
"Volcano," "Tibia," "JerHonor,"

03:22.714 --> 03:25.116
"Concretius," "The Enigma."
Oh, she's lost her mind.

03:25.184 --> 03:27.485
No, look at what the file is called.

03:27.553 --> 03:29.120
BabyNames.doc.

03:29.188 --> 03:31.722
You guys, Gina's gonna have a baby.

03:32.791 --> 03:34.826
We're clear.

03:34.893 --> 03:36.394
What was wrong with the step class?

03:36.462 --> 03:37.762
Too public. Couldn't take the risk.

03:37.830 --> 03:40.398
Also, one of us yarfed all
over himself after the class.

03:40.466 --> 03:42.433
Yeah, and it doesn't matter
which one of us he was.

03:42.501 --> 03:44.168
So what kind of dirt did
you dig up on Hawkins?

03:44.236 --> 03:46.671
Nothing concrete, but we think
we know their next target:

03:46.738 --> 03:48.439
Capital Trust Bank, Fort Greene Branch.

03:48.507 --> 03:50.808
As part of our investigation
into the Golden Gang,

03:50.876 --> 03:53.644
she managed to get alarm
schematics and blueprints.

03:53.712 --> 03:55.513
It's the perfect cover. She's so smooth.

03:55.581 --> 03:58.748
Oh, yeah, she's a smooth criminal.
M.J., R.I.P.

03:58.884 --> 04:00.585
The problem is, we're not
in her inner circle.

04:00.652 --> 04:03.187
She barely talks to us, and
I've been super charming.

04:03.255 --> 04:05.089
So...

04:05.157 --> 04:08.459
what you binging these days?

04:08.527 --> 04:09.794
What? Everyone's binging these days.

04:09.862 --> 04:11.162
It's how we consume content.

04:11.230 --> 04:13.097
We need to find out a
way to earn her trust.

04:13.165 --> 04:15.633
Normally, I'd say work hard,
prove you're good cops,

04:15.701 --> 04:17.601
but she doesn't want
good cops around her.

04:17.668 --> 04:19.837
Oh, dip. That's right, Captain.

04:19.904 --> 04:21.204
She doesn't want good cops around her.

04:21.273 --> 04:23.107
We're just gonna have to convince her

04:23.175 --> 04:25.209
- that we're dirty.
- How do you plan to do that?

04:25.277 --> 04:27.778
With the help of the
sketchiest dude we know.

04:27.846 --> 04:29.514
I am so honored you guys thought of me.

04:29.581 --> 04:31.703
You're not gonna regret this.

04:32.878 --> 04:34.339
So, Adrian...

04:34.341 --> 04:35.948
Working from home, hum? What
happened to the office?

04:35.998 --> 04:37.098
Couldn't afford the rent.

04:37.378 --> 04:38.412
I'll be honest with you guys,

04:38.480 --> 04:40.618
this PI thing is not going great.

04:40.620 --> 04:42.220
Got a couple of bad reviews online,

04:42.288 --> 04:43.522
and that pretty much tanked me.

04:43.589 --> 04:45.724
I mean, what does "weird
energy" even mean?

04:45.792 --> 04:47.325
- Am I right?
- Well, my guess is that

04:47.393 --> 04:50.328
people find you somewhat
threatening and erratic.

04:50.396 --> 04:52.531
Okay, yeah. That tracks.

04:52.598 --> 04:54.733
But jokes on them 'cause
I'm having tons of fun

04:54.801 --> 04:57.002
with all this free time.
Catching up on reading,

04:57.070 --> 04:58.704
going for walks. It's great.

04:58.771 --> 05:00.639
The other day, I walked
all the way to Maryland.

05:00.707 --> 05:02.307
- Gorgeous.
- Well, listen,

05:02.375 --> 05:04.342
- we need your help.
- Great, who are we killing?

05:04.410 --> 05:06.478
I won't do kids. That's a rule.

05:06.546 --> 05:08.747
But that rule is negotiable
if the kids a dick.

05:08.815 --> 05:10.348
No, babe, we don't want
you to kill anyone.

05:10.416 --> 05:11.583
- What? Really?
- No.

05:11.651 --> 05:13.151
We need to make Lieutenant Hawkins think

05:13.219 --> 05:14.486
that Diaz and Peralta are dirty.

05:14.554 --> 05:16.321
When you went undercover in the mob,

05:16.389 --> 05:17.689
how did you convince them
you could be trusted?

05:17.757 --> 05:19.391
Easy. You just take one of their guys

05:19.459 --> 05:20.559
and beat him to a pulp in front of them.

05:20.626 --> 05:22.160
Well, that's all well and good,

05:22.228 --> 05:23.395
but we're not actually dirty.

05:23.463 --> 05:24.763
We can't just beat somebody up.

05:24.831 --> 05:27.399
What if that someone
gave you permission?

05:27.467 --> 05:29.000
Babe, do you want us to beat you up?

05:29.068 --> 05:31.737
Ugh, yes, please.
Anything to feel alive.

05:31.804 --> 05:33.672
I was lying before about
enjoying walking.

05:33.740 --> 05:35.207
It sucks,

05:35.274 --> 05:37.509
and Maryland is a giant pile of garbage.

05:37.577 --> 05:40.078
Okay, so we beat the
crap out of my fiancé.

05:40.146 --> 05:41.580
- And you're okay with this?
- Yeah.

05:41.647 --> 05:43.582
- I just want him to be happy.
- Aww.

05:43.649 --> 05:46.118
You guys are a weird couple,
but it appears we have a plan.

05:46.185 --> 05:47.619
Okay, here are the ground rules:

05:47.687 --> 05:49.688
You can punch me, kick me, pull my hair,

05:49.756 --> 05:52.190
I am a-ok being stabbed,

05:52.258 --> 05:54.793
biting and scratching are on the table,

05:54.861 --> 05:58.029
- you can use fire.
- These are the ground rules?

05:58.097 --> 06:00.098
Is there anything off limits?

06:00.166 --> 06:01.633
Damn, man.

06:01.701 --> 06:03.535
You got something really
sick you wanna do, huh?

06:03.603 --> 06:05.303
Oh, you little pervert.

06:05.371 --> 06:07.439
All right, I like it. Don't tell me.

06:07.507 --> 06:10.108
Surprise me. Ooh, this is gonna be fun.

06:10.176 --> 06:12.043
Now remember,

06:12.111 --> 06:14.312
if she's expecting, she'll
tell us when she's ready.

06:14.380 --> 06:16.047
I don't know how she
could keep this from me.

06:16.115 --> 06:17.816
I'm her brother. I mean,
when Genevieve and I

06:17.884 --> 06:19.751
knew we were going to adopt,
I told her immediately.

06:19.819 --> 06:21.653
- You told everyone.
- Put your hands up,

06:21.721 --> 06:23.488
and start clapping for me

06:23.556 --> 06:26.758
'cause I'm gonna be a daddy.

06:26.826 --> 06:28.393
Aww, thank you.

06:28.461 --> 06:30.328
You're gonna need to hold your horses

06:30.396 --> 06:32.230
and respect Gina's privacy.

06:32.298 --> 06:33.832
Fine, I will.

06:33.900 --> 06:36.401
What the hell? Is she drinking coffee?

06:36.469 --> 06:39.271
Boyle, no.

06:39.338 --> 06:41.740
- What're you doing, you psycho?
- What're you doing?

06:41.808 --> 06:43.241
You shouldn't be drinking caffeine.

06:43.309 --> 06:44.242
That can stunt the growth of your ba...

06:47.180 --> 06:48.413
- No, no, no, no.
- by, your baby.

06:48.481 --> 06:50.182
Excuse me? What are you trying to say?

06:50.249 --> 06:51.616
Nothing. We don't think your pregnant.

06:51.684 --> 06:53.318
Sharon's pregnant. Uh, that's not true.

06:53.386 --> 06:54.686
God, I hope it's not true.

06:54.754 --> 06:56.688
What if Sharon's pregnant?

06:56.756 --> 06:58.590
Well, it would appear you've
figured out my little secret.

06:58.658 --> 07:00.759
We don't know no secret. You be crazy.

07:00.827 --> 07:03.628
I always talk like this. Down in Kokomo.

07:03.696 --> 07:05.263
Mm-kay. It's fine.

07:05.331 --> 07:07.499
You might as well know. I am with child.

07:07.567 --> 07:09.768
- Congratulations.
- Yes, I'm gonna be an uncle.

07:09.836 --> 07:11.303
I'm gonna be an uncle. All right,

07:11.370 --> 07:12.537
someone take a picture
of me kissing her belly.

07:12.605 --> 07:14.506
- Negative, get out.
- Okay, fine,

07:14.574 --> 07:15.640
but you have to tell us everything.

07:15.708 --> 07:17.542
How do you feel? When are you due?

07:17.610 --> 07:19.277
Oh, my God, I don't even
know who the father is.

07:19.345 --> 07:20.812
- Who's the father?
- Who's the father?

07:20.880 --> 07:23.882
Well, let's just say he's
a destroyer of worlds,

07:23.950 --> 07:27.786
- and I am his moon and stars.
- Amazing.

07:27.854 --> 07:29.855
I still need his name, phone
number, and shirt size.

07:29.922 --> 07:32.224
I have a fun group
Halloween costume idea.

07:32.291 --> 07:33.859
I won't tell you what it is.

07:33.926 --> 07:35.861
It's "Three Men and a
Baby." You're Guttenberg.

07:35.928 --> 07:38.463
Right, well, I would love
to give you that info,

07:38.531 --> 07:41.800
but there's one little problem.

07:41.868 --> 07:43.635
I signed a non-disclosure agreement,

07:43.703 --> 07:45.904
which bars me from
revealing his identity.

07:45.972 --> 07:48.473
Wait, is he famous.

07:48.541 --> 07:51.476
- Is it Batali?
- Charles, she can't say.

07:51.544 --> 07:53.645
- Is it Batali?
- Legally, I cannot say.

07:53.713 --> 07:56.548
I'm so sorry, guys, but
I can give you a hint,

07:56.616 --> 07:58.817
He real famous.

07:58.885 --> 08:00.852
Ooh, y'all are agog.

08:00.920 --> 08:04.756
Textbook agog. Come on,
fetus, let's bounce.

08:04.824 --> 08:07.359
- This way, D-bag.
- Get your pig hands off me.

08:07.426 --> 08:08.727
- You pigs!
- Hey, who's this?

08:08.794 --> 08:10.428
Now who's asking a lot of questions.

08:10.496 --> 08:12.330
Ooh, schnoops.

08:12.398 --> 08:14.499
You said that to her before and
then she flipped it on you.

08:14.567 --> 08:16.935
You got flipped on, son.

08:17.003 --> 08:18.737
What did I do? I didn't
do anything wrong.

08:18.804 --> 08:19.938
Really? 'Cause you haven't paid us

08:20.006 --> 08:21.673
in a week.

08:21.741 --> 08:23.842
Oh, God, I swear. I'll
get you the money.

08:23.910 --> 08:25.510
I just need a little more...

08:25.578 --> 08:27.445
Oh, my God, you really punched me.

08:27.513 --> 08:29.514
Oh, my God, that hurt.

08:29.582 --> 08:30.916
- Are you okay?
- What?

08:30.983 --> 08:32.384
Yeah, this is my character.
I'm a coward.

08:32.451 --> 08:33.852
Come on. Give me everything you got.

08:33.919 --> 08:35.687
Oh.

08:35.755 --> 08:37.222
Where's our money?

08:37.289 --> 08:39.390
Oh, my kidneys.

08:39.457 --> 08:41.359
Oh, I'm pretty sure I'm
bleeding internally.

08:41.427 --> 08:43.695
- Oh, God.
- Get up.

08:43.763 --> 08:45.797
I am so sorry.

08:45.865 --> 08:47.198
Why? It's going great.

08:47.266 --> 08:48.400
Punch me really hard in the stomach.

08:48.467 --> 08:49.868
Oh, okay.

08:49.936 --> 08:52.370
I think you broke my ribs.

08:52.438 --> 08:55.874
Ah, you're really hurting me.
Please, stop hurting me.

08:57.610 --> 08:59.277
What are you doing? I
said stop hurting me.

08:59.345 --> 09:00.712
What? I thought you were in character.

09:00.780 --> 09:01.947
No, no, I don't have health insurance.

09:02.014 --> 09:03.381
- This could bankrupt me.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

09:03.449 --> 09:04.749
I'm just very confused. Come on.

09:05.952 --> 09:07.452
Get us the money by Friday

09:07.520 --> 09:09.487
or I'll break more than your ribs.

09:09.555 --> 09:12.390
Jake.

09:12.458 --> 09:15.260
We're being watched? Uh-oh.

09:16.963 --> 09:18.663
How many times have I smacked you

09:18.731 --> 09:19.831
- in your face?
- Lost count.

09:19.899 --> 09:21.566
And you still have no fear of me.

09:21.634 --> 09:22.667
I'm trying to read your womb vibe.

09:22.735 --> 09:24.402
Exactly. Knock it off.

09:24.470 --> 09:25.837
The daddy's your Property
Brother, isn't he?

09:25.905 --> 09:27.605
- It's a Property Baby.
- Charles, you know

09:27.673 --> 09:28.840
I legally can't answer.

09:28.908 --> 09:30.408
Do you want me to have my baby in jail?

09:30.476 --> 09:31.843
All right, no more questions.
Only statements.

09:31.911 --> 09:33.745
You are glowing.

09:33.813 --> 09:35.747
Brother to sister, you've
never looked sexier.

09:35.815 --> 09:37.415
Come on, man.

09:37.483 --> 09:38.850
Uh, you guys, I would
love to stay and chat

09:38.918 --> 09:41.419
about my unborn king or queen,

09:41.487 --> 09:43.688
but I just got a text from...

09:43.756 --> 09:45.256
redacted,

09:45.324 --> 09:46.992
and he wants to take me
to a fancy lunch at...

09:47.059 --> 09:48.593
redacted,

09:48.661 --> 09:50.962
so I gotta get outta
here, but you know what?

09:51.030 --> 09:53.598
I'll be back at redacted o'clock.

09:56.869 --> 09:58.603
Bye.

09:58.671 --> 10:01.773
Okay, so she's going to meet
the father of her child,

10:01.841 --> 10:04.609
- and it is break time...
- And you better believe

10:04.677 --> 10:06.344
- that we're gonna follow her.
- Yes.

10:06.412 --> 10:08.013
The only celebrity I've
ever seen in real life

10:08.080 --> 10:09.514
was Paul Shaffer.

10:09.582 --> 10:11.883
- It was exhilarating.
- I bet.

10:11.951 --> 10:14.519
Be careful. Don't let her see us.

10:14.587 --> 10:16.721
Then you should have got a
disguise like me, idiots.

10:16.789 --> 10:18.390
Why do you even own that?

10:18.457 --> 10:20.525
I was banned from Wing Sluts
for using too much sauce,

10:20.593 --> 10:22.460
so I got it to sneak past the hostess.

10:22.528 --> 10:23.728
So far it has not worked.

10:23.796 --> 10:26.631
Wait, look. There's no fancy lunch.

10:26.699 --> 10:29.334
There's no fancy guy. She lied to us.

10:29.402 --> 10:32.003
"Redacted" my ass.

10:32.071 --> 10:33.471
What's up?

10:33.539 --> 10:35.040
So not sure if Paxton told you,

10:35.107 --> 10:36.908
but we brought a perp in earlier.

10:36.976 --> 10:38.376
Good-looking guy, weird energy.

10:38.444 --> 10:39.544
Yeah, did you get anything?

10:39.612 --> 10:40.912
He didn't know jack,

10:40.980 --> 10:42.814
but we surprisingly noticed

10:42.882 --> 10:44.382
that there was a camera in the room.

10:44.450 --> 10:45.650
And we really need that footage.

10:45.718 --> 10:46.851
- Why?
- Let's just say,

10:46.919 --> 10:48.653
in the course of questioning him,

10:48.721 --> 10:50.989
he may have accidentally fallen down

10:51.057 --> 10:52.724
- a couple of times.
- He's real clumsy.

10:52.792 --> 10:54.659
If the wrong person saw that tape,

10:54.727 --> 10:56.661
they might get the wrong idea.

10:56.729 --> 11:00.098
You know, I saw the tape,
and it was shocking

11:00.166 --> 11:02.500
how clumsy that guy actually was.

11:02.568 --> 11:05.570
- Right?
- And the funny thing is,

11:05.638 --> 11:07.672
I meant to save the file,

11:07.740 --> 11:10.075
but I deleted it by accident.

11:10.142 --> 11:11.509
Guess we're all a little clumsy.

11:11.577 --> 11:12.777
Yes, indeed.

11:12.845 --> 11:14.712
I stepped on my omelet this morning.

11:14.780 --> 11:16.848
Not pertinent, let's continue
with our covert conversation.

11:16.916 --> 11:19.117
You know, a bunch of us are
going out drinking tonight.

11:19.185 --> 11:21.453
- You wanna come?
- You know it.

11:21.520 --> 11:23.421
But I should probably warn you,

11:23.489 --> 11:24.856
me and Rosa go pretty hard.

11:24.924 --> 11:26.524
Great. Bring some coke.

11:26.592 --> 11:27.926
Oh, so you mean, hard, hard.

11:27.993 --> 11:29.594
- Hmm.
- Okay, sweet.

11:29.662 --> 11:30.962
Sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet,
sweet, sweet, sweet,

11:31.030 --> 11:32.864
sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet.

11:32.932 --> 11:36.355
Cocaine. Coc-a-ina.

11:36.365 --> 11:37.565
- No.
- No?

11:38.232 --> 11:39.295
♪

11:39.498 --> 11:41.449
Did she take the bait
like a stupid fish?

11:41.451 --> 11:42.684
Yeah, she invited us to go
out with her gang tonight.

11:42.752 --> 11:44.847
- Nice.
- Speaking of which, Captain,

11:44.849 --> 11:46.216
any luck getting coke out of evidence?

11:46.284 --> 11:49.820
One bag of primo blow,
as is the parlance.

11:49.888 --> 11:51.955
I still have reservations
about this plan.

11:52.023 --> 11:53.824
Perhaps you could say
your dealer ran out

11:53.892 --> 11:55.693
or he's summering in Nantucket.

11:55.760 --> 11:57.728
No, this is perfect. If she gets wasted,

11:57.796 --> 11:59.163
maybe she'll get sloppy
and start talking.

11:59.230 --> 12:01.331
Plus, I mean, I can teach you guys

12:01.399 --> 12:03.033
how to fake take real drugs like a pro.

12:03.101 --> 12:04.835
I used to do it all the
time when I was undercover.

12:04.903 --> 12:07.071
All you gotta do is close your
nostril when you go down.

12:07.138 --> 12:08.972
Watch this.

12:09.040 --> 12:11.208
Oh, nope. I didn't do it that time.

12:11.276 --> 12:12.743
I got a full snout full. Whoo.

12:12.811 --> 12:14.878
Okay, no,
let me just try again.

12:14.946 --> 12:16.380
I'm a little rusty. All you gotta do,

12:16.448 --> 12:18.148
just close the old nost-a-roni, and...

12:18.216 --> 12:20.150
Oh, boy, I got more than time.

12:20.218 --> 12:21.985
Oh.

12:22.053 --> 12:24.221
Whoa, where did you get this?

12:24.289 --> 12:25.756
- Adrian, that's enough.
- Oh.

12:25.824 --> 12:27.057
We can make fake cocaine for ourselves

12:27.125 --> 12:29.193
- out of vitamin B powder.
- Ooh, vitamin B.

12:29.260 --> 12:31.261
- The second-best vitamin.
- Guys, I'm telling you.

12:31.329 --> 12:33.030
The fake snorting can work. Watch.

12:33.098 --> 12:34.164
Oh.

12:36.968 --> 12:39.169
Oh, I got so much that time.

12:39.237 --> 12:41.405
Whoa, ooh, anybody wanna listen
to Jamiroquai right now?

12:41.473 --> 12:43.841
Okay, I'm just gonna move this
away from your nose holes.

12:43.908 --> 12:45.442
Well, you two should get going.

12:45.510 --> 12:47.344
If Hawkins tells you anything,
text me right away.

12:47.412 --> 12:48.846
I'll stay here and watch Adrian.

12:48.913 --> 12:50.447
Who's Adrian? Yeah, all right!

12:50.515 --> 12:52.116
Hey, any of you guys play an instrument?

12:52.183 --> 12:53.751
You know, I play a
little bit of bouzouki.

12:53.818 --> 12:55.085
Anybody else play an ancient
stringed instrument?

12:55.153 --> 12:56.854
No? You guys wanna go to the beach?

12:56.921 --> 12:58.021
It's a beautiful day. Just
maybe, like, get out there.

12:58.089 --> 12:59.757
Throw the disc around. Right?

12:59.824 --> 13:01.191
Hey, have you ever been to the
Statue of Liberty, Captain?

13:01.259 --> 13:02.860
Have you? Have you been inside?

13:02.927 --> 13:04.728
Like, under the skirt?
Like, what's up there?

13:04.796 --> 13:06.363
Did they build a... You
know what I'm saying?

13:06.431 --> 13:07.798
Oh, guys, watch this. I'm gonna juggle.

13:07.866 --> 13:10.868
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

13:10.935 --> 13:12.903
Admit it, Gina. There was no celebrity.

13:12.971 --> 13:14.738
There was no fancy lunch at redacted.

13:14.806 --> 13:16.473
Well, that's strange
because I remember eating

13:16.541 --> 13:19.042
lobster-fed beef. It's the best kind.

13:19.110 --> 13:21.912
The cows live by the sea
and they eat only lobster.

13:21.980 --> 13:24.148
- We know you're lying.
- I am offended.

13:24.215 --> 13:26.984
- Nay, outraged that...
- We saw you eating cheese pizza

13:27.051 --> 13:29.119
- all alone.
- Oh, okay, then you caught me.

13:29.187 --> 13:30.888
Gina, what is really going on?

13:30.955 --> 13:32.890
- Immaculate conception?
- No.

13:32.957 --> 13:34.825
Why did you make all that stuff up?

13:34.893 --> 13:36.393
Because I value my privacy,

13:36.461 --> 13:38.162
and it's like you guys are
always in my business,

13:38.229 --> 13:40.264
- specifically Charles.
- Look, it's just that

13:40.331 --> 13:42.733
I'm your brother and I love
you, and I'm invested,

13:42.801 --> 13:44.168
but if that's what you really want,

13:44.235 --> 13:46.136
then I'll leave you alone.

13:46.204 --> 13:48.305
Ugh, fine.

13:48.373 --> 13:50.440
I'll tell you who the baby's father is,

13:50.508 --> 13:54.244
- but you have to be chill.
- I will be so chill.

13:54.312 --> 13:56.513
The baby daddy is a Boyle cousin.

13:56.581 --> 13:58.348
It's a Boyle!

13:58.416 --> 13:59.850
Whoo!

13:59.918 --> 14:02.019
Ugh, this place smells like...

14:02.086 --> 14:03.420
Regret? Failure?

14:03.488 --> 14:05.989
- Ketchup.
- Hey, Diaz, Peralta.

14:06.057 --> 14:08.091
- Over here.
- What's up, Lieutenant?

14:08.159 --> 14:09.493
Cell phones in the bag.

14:09.561 --> 14:11.094
- Why?
- It's standard procedure.

14:11.162 --> 14:12.863
We don't like having phones at parties.

14:12.931 --> 14:15.332
Right, it's like, "Look up
from your screens people.

14:15.400 --> 14:17.301
"You're missing out on
the best app there is.

14:17.368 --> 14:19.102
- Real life."
- Well, you see, we're gonna be

14:19.170 --> 14:21.338
doing a lot of drugs and we're cops,

14:21.406 --> 14:22.539
so we don't want our pictures taken.

14:22.607 --> 14:24.341
Yeah, your reason's better.

14:24.409 --> 14:26.443
- Here you go.
- All right, then.

14:26.511 --> 14:29.980
- Here we go.
- Let's get sloppy.

14:40.024 --> 14:41.124
I like it.

14:41.192 --> 14:43.794
You guys, I found out why Gina lied

14:43.862 --> 14:45.863
about the non-disclosure agreement.

14:45.930 --> 14:47.297
Because of how invasive
and crazy you are?

14:47.365 --> 14:49.466
Oh, Terry, you gullible little rube.

14:49.534 --> 14:51.835
It's because of which cousin it is.

14:51.903 --> 14:54.171
That's right. I found
out which Boyle seed

14:54.239 --> 14:55.372
did the deed.

14:55.440 --> 14:57.975
The father is Milton.

14:58.042 --> 15:00.344
Who's Milton? We're not
a part of your family.

15:00.411 --> 15:02.012
He's a total loser.

15:02.080 --> 15:04.181
I mean, of all the Boyle's to bang,

15:04.249 --> 15:05.983
why bang Milton Boyle?

15:06.050 --> 15:07.885
- He's that bad?
- "He's that bad?"

15:07.952 --> 15:11.021
Wow, Terry, you are a rube.
Milton's a troll.

15:11.089 --> 15:13.490
Okay, look. We have to be supportive.

15:13.558 --> 15:15.325
- Gina is our friend.
- Ugh.

15:15.393 --> 15:17.527
Oh, my God, he's here.
You guys try not to puke

15:17.595 --> 15:18.996
all over yourselves when you see him.

15:19.063 --> 15:21.098
- Hi, Milton.
- Oh, hey, Charles.

15:21.165 --> 15:23.066
- He's a Boyle?
- Right?

15:23.134 --> 15:25.035
Don't look at his weird face.
You'll make him feel bad.

15:25.103 --> 15:26.937
Hey, uh, have you seen Gina?

15:27.005 --> 15:28.105
You mean ever?

15:28.172 --> 15:30.007
Get more specific, Milton.

15:30.074 --> 15:31.341
Milty!

15:31.409 --> 15:32.910
Hey!

15:32.977 --> 15:34.044
Mmm.

15:34.112 --> 15:35.512
What're you doing here?

Thought I would take my warrior goddess

15:37.348 --> 15:39.583
- out to a surprise dinner.
- Oh, is the surprise

15:39.651 --> 15:41.084
that you can afford dinner

15:41.152 --> 15:42.519
since you dropped out of high school?

15:42.587 --> 15:44.021
I left after junior year

15:44.088 --> 15:45.088
to be a professional snowboarder.

15:45.156 --> 15:46.890
- Oh.
- And now he owns

15:46.958 --> 15:50.427
a winter apparel company that
donates snow to the poor.

15:50.495 --> 15:52.462
- Water.
- You're so amazing.

15:52.530 --> 15:55.032
You're so amazing.

15:56.334 --> 15:58.936
Oh, they're dancing now.

15:59.003 --> 16:00.437
Are you guys doing the Lambada?

16:00.505 --> 16:02.372
Hmm, I guess we are.

16:02.440 --> 16:05.108
I hadn't noticed. Sometimes
we just do that.

16:05.176 --> 16:06.944
Aww, you guys make a cute couple.

16:07.011 --> 16:10.047
You're welcome. Now enjoy
watching us leave.

16:10.114 --> 16:11.982
Hey, I had a great idea for a baby name.

16:12.050 --> 16:13.650
- What is it?
- If it's a girl,

16:13.718 --> 16:15.552
how about "The Enigma"?

16:15.620 --> 16:17.154
Oh, my God, I already thought of that,

16:17.221 --> 16:18.989
and then if it's a boy,
it could just be...

16:19.057 --> 16:21.658
"The Enigmo."

16:21.726 --> 16:22.993
Bye, Charles. I love you.

16:23.061 --> 16:25.062
Bye, Milton. I love you too.

16:25.129 --> 16:26.964
Come on, Charles, you have to admit,

16:27.031 --> 16:28.398
they're perfect for each other.

16:28.466 --> 16:30.000
Yeah, I guess I'm happy for her.

16:30.068 --> 16:32.336
Let's just hope the baby
doesn't get his looks.

16:32.403 --> 16:35.172
- What a dweeb.
- Nah, bro, he's hot.

16:36.474 --> 16:39.076
Oh, wow, that's good stuff.

16:39.143 --> 16:41.078
- Who's your guy?
- Actually, it's a woman.

16:41.145 --> 16:43.680
Women can be drug
dealers too #lmWithHer.

16:43.748 --> 16:45.582
- Here.
- Oh, no, I'm good.

16:45.650 --> 16:47.184
Not to be snobby,

16:47.251 --> 16:49.286
but I got my own stash. It's the bomb.

16:49.354 --> 16:50.988
Smuggled this vial in on a plane.

16:51.055 --> 16:53.357
Stuck it right up my butt.

16:53.424 --> 16:54.424
- Want some?
- No, thanks.

16:54.492 --> 16:55.692
I'm good with the non-butt coke.

16:55.760 --> 16:58.295
Suit yourself.

16:59.664 --> 17:01.431
Bartender made me my favorite drink.

17:01.499 --> 17:04.034
- It's called a bottle of whiskey.
- I like your style.
