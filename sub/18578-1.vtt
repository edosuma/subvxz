00:15.474 --> 00:18.273
( Pigeons cooing,
wings fluttering )

00:22.189 --> 00:25.159
( music playing )

03:14.152 --> 03:16.655
( ball bouncing )

03:20.492 --> 03:21.835
( swoosh )

03:25.789 --> 03:29.009
Man:
Church, let's bow our heads

03:29.167 --> 03:32.922
for a brief prayer for our
recently departed Bishop Enoch.

03:33.088 --> 03:37.184
- Man #2: He's in a better place now.
- Man: Pray for his lovely family.

03:37.342 --> 03:39.015
- Woman: Praise Jesus.
- Man: Amen!

03:39.177 --> 03:42.021
Congregation: Amen!

03:42.180 --> 03:44.353
Man:
And Jesus spoke to them, saying,

03:44.516 --> 03:47.690
"He who eateth my flesh
and drinketh my blood..."

03:47.853 --> 03:49.571
- Man #3: Uh-huh.
- Man: "...shall have eternal life,"

03:49.730 --> 03:54.406
and I shall raise you up
in the last day.

03:54.568 --> 03:58.163
For my flesh
is the drink indeed,

03:58.321 --> 04:02.042
- "and my blood is the drink indeed..."
- Man #4: Hallelujah!

04:02.200 --> 04:06.205
"...for whosoever eateth my flesh
and drinketh my blood

04:06.371 --> 04:08.251
- "shall abide in me..."
- Woman: Yes, yes, yes!

04:08.331 --> 04:10.925
- "...and I in him."
- Woman: Yes!

04:11.084 --> 04:14.213
- Amen, church, amen!
- Congregation: Amen!

04:14.379 --> 04:16.221
Pick up your Bible.

04:16.380 --> 04:19.100
- Put down that .22.
- Congregation: Uh-huh!

04:19.259 --> 04:21.557
- Put down that .38.
- Yes!

04:21.720 --> 04:23.722
Put down your .45.

04:23.889 --> 04:27.018
Oh, glory to God, lift up your Bible
and put down that Uzi.

04:27.184 --> 04:28.857
- Man #4: That's right.
- All: Yes!

04:29.019 --> 04:33.399
- You don't need no AK-47.
- Man #2: No, you don't!

04:33.565 --> 04:36.114
You need Romans 8:21.

04:36.276 --> 04:37.368
( laughter)

04:37.527 --> 04:40.872
Put down your nuclear arms!

04:41.031 --> 04:42.408
( Cheering )

04:46.411 --> 04:47.913
- Yes, thank you, yes.
- Yes, God.

04:48.079 --> 04:50.081
Oh, glory to God,
right now, right here.

04:50.248 --> 04:53.878
- Whoo! Oh, right here.
- Uh-huh, uh-huh!

04:54.044 --> 04:55.605
- Hallelujah!
- God loves you right now.

04:55.754 --> 04:58.303
He's giving you
the power right now.

04:58.465 --> 05:00.308
- Say, "I accept it."
- All: I accept it.

05:00.467 --> 05:02.765
But you got to say,
"I accept You, Lord God."

05:02.928 --> 05:04.271
All:
I accept You, Lord God.

05:04.429 --> 05:05.931
- Thank You.
- All: Thank You.

05:06.097 --> 05:08.600
- For living in my life.
- All: For living in my life.

05:08.767 --> 05:10.485
- Right here.
- All: Right here.

05:10.644 --> 05:12.442
- Right now.
- All: Right now.

05:12.604 --> 05:14.402
- I love You.
- All: I love You.

05:14.564 --> 05:15.656
I love You.

05:15.816 --> 05:17.284
All: I love You.

05:17.442 --> 05:19.786
I would never
turn my back on You.

05:19.945 --> 05:22.073
All: I would never
turn my back on You.

05:22.239 --> 05:23.912
- Amen.
- Woman: Amen.

05:24.074 --> 05:25.917
Woman #2:
Bless the Lord Jesus.

05:30.288 --> 05:33.132
Dr. Greene, you know my associate,
Mr. Hightower.

05:33.291 --> 05:35.411
- Such a pleasure to see you again.
- Pleasure's mine.

05:39.464 --> 05:41.307
Would you like to see
what we found?

05:44.928 --> 05:47.101
Magnificent.

05:47.264 --> 05:49.266
Absolutely magnificent.

05:51.476 --> 05:54.025
I think this may be
one of the finest

05:54.187 --> 05:57.361
Ashanti relics
to be discovered.

06:00.777 --> 06:02.450
X-rays reveal

06:02.612 --> 06:04.956
fragments of bone and skull.

06:05.115 --> 06:07.789
Notice the curious markings.

06:07.951 --> 06:09.624
A thousand years before

06:09.786 --> 06:12.209
the Egyptians
performed surgeries,

06:12.372 --> 06:16.343
the Ashanti used anesthetics

06:16.501 --> 06:19.095
and developed
mold cultures, diseases,

06:19.254 --> 06:21.097
and performed
blood transfusions.

06:21.256 --> 06:24.476
Queen Helgda suffered
from a blood disease.

06:24.634 --> 06:27.228
Ashanti's surgeons
came up with the idea

06:27.387 --> 06:29.014
of transfusing blood

06:29.180 --> 06:30.932
from the strong and healthy
to the queen.

06:32.225 --> 06:35.445
But she needed so much blood,
her victims were bled to death.

06:35.604 --> 06:39.404
Soon, the entire population
became addicted to blood.

06:39.566 --> 06:43.196
It was only a matter of years
before an almost bloodless nation

06:43.361 --> 06:45.659
began to die
of pernicious anemia.

06:45.822 --> 06:48.166
Queen Helgda raised armies
and destroyed the nearby lands

06:48.325 --> 06:51.875
in a series of blood wars.

06:52.037 --> 06:53.584
Blood was desired.

06:53.747 --> 06:57.547
I suppose,
if I believed in desire,

06:57.709 --> 07:00.383
it wouldn't
frighten me so much.

07:00.545 --> 07:03.594
But the idea of desire
is a part of our culture.

07:03.757 --> 07:06.260
I believe the Ashanti
evolved a need for blood.

07:06.426 --> 07:08.554
Not a passion for it...
it was a need.

07:08.720 --> 07:11.564
It's more of a perversion
than that.

07:11.723 --> 07:14.602
Something one would feel
guilty about needing.

07:14.768 --> 07:15.940
After all,

07:16.102 --> 07:19.231
blood has a dreadful connotation,

07:19.397 --> 07:23.868
like a passion
for soiled underwear or urine.

07:25.612 --> 07:28.786
Desiring and drinking blood
is a very antisocial act.

07:28.949 --> 07:32.624
Unless we happen to exist
in a blood society.

07:32.786 --> 07:35.881
Ah, but we do exist
in a blood society.

07:36.039 --> 07:39.293
The United States of America is the most
violent country in the world.

07:39.459 --> 07:40.927
We're the best in the business.

07:41.086 --> 07:43.464
Dr. Greene,

07:43.630 --> 07:46.224
I've read all your books
several times.

07:46.383 --> 07:49.478
You think I'm impressive?

07:49.636 --> 07:51.229
Yes.

07:51.388 --> 07:54.892
And you discover everything
through your senses.

07:58.645 --> 08:00.989
You...

08:01.147 --> 08:04.026
love art.

08:04.192 --> 08:06.320
Art is God's ally.

08:06.486 --> 08:08.784
Science, God's natural foe,
would you agree?

08:08.947 --> 08:11.325
- Let me think about it.
- ( Chuckles )

08:14.536 --> 08:16.709
Dr. Greene?

08:16.871 --> 08:19.294
You have a wonderful home.

08:24.504 --> 08:27.633
How far does the property go?

08:27.799 --> 08:29.016
About 40 acres.

08:29.175 --> 08:32.304
- Do you mind if I get some air?
- Not at all.

08:32.470 --> 08:35.895
I have some reading
to do before I sleep.

08:36.057 --> 08:38.309
I'll see you in the morning,
say 8:30?

08:38.476 --> 08:39.727
Good.

08:39.894 --> 08:42.738
Oh, have a good night's sleep,
as I will.

08:54.576 --> 08:56.328
( Boat horn blows )

09:00.165 --> 09:01.838
( boat horn blows )

09:06.004 --> 09:08.006
( owl hooting )

09:17.015 --> 09:19.859
( distant howling )

09:34.532 --> 09:36.830
( louder howling )

09:43.291 --> 09:44.634
Hightower!

09:47.420 --> 09:49.889
- ( Howling continues )
- Hightower!

09:58.890 --> 10:01.268
Hightower, is that you?

10:07.232 --> 10:09.735
- I've been drinking.
- You haven't been drinking enough

10:09.901 --> 10:12.074
to jump from out of my tree.

10:12.237 --> 10:15.241
This isn't your tree.

10:15.406 --> 10:18.250
It is Almighty God's tree.

10:18.409 --> 10:20.503
God didn't buy
this 40 acres, I did.

10:20.662 --> 10:23.415
Money don't mean shit to me.

10:23.581 --> 10:25.458
Especially since I never had any.

10:25.625 --> 10:27.753
Well, money doesn't matter
that much to me, either.

10:27.919 --> 10:28.966
Don't look like it.

10:29.129 --> 10:31.632
Your mother ever tell you
all that glitters ain't gold?

10:31.798 --> 10:34.051
No, but I do love
that Spinners song.

10:34.217 --> 10:36.640
My favorite Spinners song
is "Mighty Love."

10:36.803 --> 10:39.181
None of this
has anything to do with you.

10:39.347 --> 10:42.021
Mr. Hightower,
that's my tree and my rope.

10:42.183 --> 10:44.026
And I'm afraid
that would give the authorities

10:44.185 --> 10:47.359
a right to invade my privacy with
all sorts of embarrassing questions.

10:47.522 --> 10:49.069
I thought
it'd be more considerate

10:49.232 --> 10:52.156
to use the Atlantic Ocean
to end my life.

10:52.318 --> 10:53.991
I have a fear of water.

10:54.154 --> 10:56.998
Thank God your fear
outweighs your manners.

10:57.157 --> 11:00.502
I tried to find a way
not to involve you.

11:00.660 --> 11:03.459
The fact is I'm involved,
Mr. Hightower.

11:03.621 --> 11:05.294
Now, there's no way
for you to know this,

11:05.456 --> 11:07.254
but I'm the only
colored on the block,

11:07.417 --> 11:09.636
so when a black man
washes up ashore around here,

11:09.794 --> 11:11.922
you can bet they're gonna
drag me in for questioning.

11:12.088 --> 11:14.716
Will you come down
from my tree now?

11:16.843 --> 11:18.265
I'm begging you.

11:28.438 --> 11:30.190
Dr. Hightower:
I'm sorry.

11:30.356 --> 11:32.825
I'm sorry, Dr. Hess.

11:35.528 --> 11:37.371
I'm sorry, I hope you could
forgive me.

11:37.530 --> 11:39.908
It's all right, just...

11:40.074 --> 11:42.873
please, come down.

11:43.036 --> 11:44.538
Be careful.

11:47.457 --> 11:49.835
- For the love of God, come down!
- Okay!

11:50.001 --> 11:51.753
Aah! Oh...

11:51.920 --> 11:53.092
( thuds ) Fuck!

11:53.254 --> 11:55.677
I just spent six months
in Bellevue.

11:58.259 --> 12:02.014
Working too hard,

12:02.180 --> 12:04.274
suffering with
migraine headaches.

12:04.432 --> 12:08.528
I have wasted
so many years in therapy.

12:09.938 --> 12:12.441
I'm totally dependent
on the system.

12:12.607 --> 12:14.530
And when that fails me,

12:14.692 --> 12:18.742
I set out to find another system
by which I can exist.

12:22.659 --> 12:26.038
I read blogs,

12:26.204 --> 12:28.548
self-help books,

12:28.706 --> 12:30.333
et cetera.

12:30.500 --> 12:32.753
Anything to find a way to cope

12:32.919 --> 12:35.798
with a society I despise.

12:35.964 --> 12:38.137
My ex-wife

12:38.299 --> 12:41.644
is a natural bitch.

12:42.971 --> 12:44.518
I don't even know
why I married her.

12:44.681 --> 12:47.184
( laughing )

12:50.979 --> 12:52.322
Are you more interested

12:52.480 --> 12:54.574
in the blood of Christ
than in His body?

12:54.732 --> 12:56.780
I've lost all interest
in the flesh.

12:56.943 --> 12:59.321
So much for what you've lost.
What have you gained?

12:59.487 --> 13:01.489
Are you asking me
what are my beliefs?

13:01.656 --> 13:03.624
Why did the Ashanti
refer to it as

13:03.783 --> 13:05.911
"the beginning of death"

13:06.077 --> 13:08.205
rather than "the end of life"?

13:08.371 --> 13:10.465
I suppose they knew
something we didn't.

13:10.623 --> 13:12.796
Is it terrible to drink blood?

13:12.959 --> 13:16.429
It's less of a sacrilege
to drink blood than to spill it.

13:21.384 --> 13:23.637
I hope my mood swings
do not affect

13:23.803 --> 13:26.852
my employment with you
on this research project.

13:28.474 --> 13:32.650
I'm going to sleep now,
Dr. Greene.

13:32.812 --> 13:34.655
(sighs )

13:34.814 --> 13:36.157
Have a good night.

13:56.461 --> 13:58.088
( Screams )

14:01.549 --> 14:04.723
( both grunting )

14:13.227 --> 14:14.604
Ugh!

14:23.654 --> 14:25.406
( Keening )

14:33.247 --> 14:34.669
( moans )

14:40.671 --> 14:43.800
( sobbing )

15:18.042 --> 15:20.591
( clock ticking )

15:39.522 --> 15:40.944
( gunshot) ( gasps )

15:43.317 --> 15:45.160
(sighs )

16:39.624 --> 16:41.626
( gasping )

16:53.387 --> 16:55.890
Grant, O Lord,

16:56.057 --> 16:58.105
that as we are baptized
into the death

16:58.267 --> 16:59.985
of Thy blessed son,

17:00.144 --> 17:02.647
our Savior Jesus Christ,

17:02.813 --> 17:05.817
so by continually mortifying
our corrupt affections,

17:05.983 --> 17:07.984
we may be buried with Him

17:08.152 --> 17:10.780
and that through the grave
and gate of death,

17:10.946 --> 17:13.665
we may pass to our
joyful resurrection,

17:13.824 --> 17:17.545
for His merits,
who died and was buried

17:17.703 --> 17:20.252
and rose again for us the same,

17:20.414 --> 17:23.133
Thy Son,
Jesus Christ, our Lord.

17:23.291 --> 17:25.294
- ( Gunshot)
- ( Gasping )

17:51.112 --> 17:53.206
Amen.

17:56.826 --> 17:59.249
All right, Mr. Long.
Don't move.

17:59.412 --> 18:00.709
I'll be right back.

18:02.748 --> 18:03.920
Hey-
- He)!-

18:04.083 --> 18:05.585
Doctor:
How was your date last night?

18:05.751 --> 18:07.594
Nurse:
It was really fine.

18:16.345 --> 18:18.598
- Fire!
- Nurse: Fire?

18:18.764 --> 18:19.981
- There's a fire in there!
- Oh, my God!

18:20.141 --> 18:22.735
Afire!

18:22.893 --> 18:25.237
- Doctor: Hold on.
- ( Fire extinguisher hissing )

18:26.981 --> 18:28.741
- Don't panic.
- Nurse: All right, all right.

18:28.899 --> 18:30.572
Doctor: Don't...

18:37.575 --> 18:39.623
Woman: That's more complicated,
and that's more personal.

18:39.785 --> 18:42.629
I'm talking about using resources
that we can evolve in.

18:42.788 --> 18:44.165
Dr. Greene:
How are your drinks, ladies?

18:44.332 --> 18:46.209
- Just fine, Dr. Greene.
- Oh, refreshing.

18:46.375 --> 18:49.128
- Where's yours?
- Oh, I don't drink before 5:00.

18:49.295 --> 18:50.592
That's what they all say.

18:50.755 --> 18:52.473
Please help us
to settle an argument.

18:52.632 --> 18:55.306
Ms. Blair here says
that change is impossible

18:55.468 --> 18:57.596
because we're addicted
to our society,

18:57.762 --> 18:59.435
especially the upper-middle <i>class</i>

18:59.597 --> 19:02.476
because they've taken the damn thing
in such large doses,

19:02.642 --> 19:05.145
we're all junkies
of one sort or another.

19:05.311 --> 19:08.656
What decides
if one is a criminal or not

19:08.814 --> 19:12.159
is which side of the law
your fix is on.

19:12.318 --> 19:13.490
Really?

19:13.653 --> 19:15.075
Ms. Blair,
that makes us all guilty.

19:15.237 --> 19:16.705
On the contrary.

19:16.864 --> 19:18.286
That makes us all innocent.

19:18.449 --> 19:21.328
Well, if my social sins were to ever
bring me before a judge,

19:21.494 --> 19:23.337
I would rather it were Ms. Blair.

19:23.496 --> 19:25.794
Where's the progress
in discovering a crime

19:25.956 --> 19:27.503
and then excusing it?

19:27.667 --> 19:29.761
We might as well go back
to swinging in trees.

19:29.919 --> 19:31.967
But Africa is the cradle
of civilization.

19:32.129 --> 19:33.130
Touché.

19:33.297 --> 19:38.144
Dr. Greene, you have the most
magnificent display of African art.

19:38.302 --> 19:39.554
When did you start collecting?

19:39.720 --> 19:42.143
Ms. Blair,
Africa is my passion.

19:42.306 --> 19:44.183
Will you excuse me, ladies?

19:44.350 --> 19:45.727
- Of course.
- Yes.

19:47.436 --> 19:50.280

Right?

22:24.969 --> 22:27.313
Have we ruined it?

22:27.471 --> 22:29.269
It's just a little heavy
on the vodka.

Summer colds are the worst.

But it's not summer.

30:40.797 --> 30:42.799
Well, it's summer somewhere.

30:48.972 --> 30:50.940
Good afternoon, Dr. Greene.
How are you today?

30:51.099 --> 30:52.225

30:52.392 --> 30:54.065

40:13.036 --> 40:15.164

40:23.421 --> 40:24.764
How'd you meet?

40:27.216 --> 40:28.718

40:28.885 --> 40:31.559

to Saint-Tropez for a holiday,

40:31.721 --> 40:33.769
both alone.

40:33.932 --> 40:35.184
I was standing in front of him,

40:35.350 --> 40:37.352
and I could feel
somebody burning a hole

40:37.518 --> 40:40.362
in the back of my head
like a laser.

40:40.521 --> 40:42.899
It was intense.

40:43.066 --> 40:46.070
Finally, I turned around,
and I said to Lafayette,

40:46.235 --> 40:48.579
- "May I help you?"
- What did he say?

40:48.738 --> 40:51.412
He smiled.

40:51.574 --> 40:53.247
Lafayette has a great smile.

40:56.079 --> 40:58.673

"I've been looking for you"

41:00.583 --> 41:03.507
"Where have you been
all my unhappy life?"

41:03.670 --> 41:06.264
- And what did you say?
- Please.

41:06.422 --> 41:07.423
His answer?

41:07.590 --> 41:10.685
"I've been looking for you
for the last 2,000 years."

41:10.843 --> 41:11.844
What did you say?

41:12.011 --> 41:15.140
"Oh, fuck off."

41:15.306 --> 41:16.558
You're lying.

41:16.724 --> 41:19.193
Dr. Greene, I've already
told you, I don't lie.

41:19.352 --> 41:22.231
We left Saint-Tropez engaged,

41:22.397 --> 41:24.946
and it's all been
downhill since then.

41:25.108 --> 41:28.658
Fast-forward, I'm stuck in
a funky hotel in Amsterdam,

41:28.820 --> 41:31.039
he was supposed to wire me money,
which he didn't,

41:31.197 --> 41:34.076
so I had to call my parents,
which I hate,

41:34.242 --> 41:36.961
to get my backside
back to the States.

41:37.120 --> 41:38.793
When did you get divorced?

41:42.166 --> 41:44.669
Are you married?

41:44.836 --> 41:46.213
No.

41:46.379 --> 41:48.473
You have baby mamas
with babies?

41:48.631 --> 41:50.224

41:50.383 --> 41:53.353
No baby mamas with babies.

41:53.511 --> 41:54.728

41:54.887 --> 41:56.981
Why does everyone
think a man my age

41:57.140 --> 41:59.643
who isn't married
is homosexual?

41:59.809 --> 42:01.903
Don't answer that.

- Bisexual.

Care to partake?

43:19.680 --> 43:21.182
I have to confess.

43:24.852 --> 43:26.695
I've killed a human being.

43:28.439 --> 43:30.441
I hope one of them
was Lafayette.

43:31.859 --> 43:36.114
As Christ died for our sins
and was buried,

43:36.280 --> 43:39.659
so also is it to be
believed that...

43:39.826 --> 43:41.999
He went down into hell.

43:45.248 --> 43:48.422
I, Dr. Hess Greene,

43:48.584 --> 43:51.258

of the very souls

43:51.420 --> 43:53.263
before God Almighty.

43:56.968 --> 43:58.766
So help me, Jesus.

44:14.819 --> 44:17.038
You're just high.

44:17.196 --> 44:18.698
It's all right.

44:25.872 --> 44:28.125

You're not eating, my dear.

01:02:33.416 --> 01:02:35.965
I'm not very hungry.

01:02:36.127 --> 01:02:37.925
It's delicious.

Just couldn't cook dinner.
That's all.

01:02:47.097 --> 01:02:48.189
Fair enough.

01:02:48.348 --> 01:02:51.192
I know you killed my husband.

01:02:51.351 --> 01:02:52.728
Ex-husband.

01:02:52.894 --> 01:02:54.862
You have his dead body

01:02:55.021 --> 01:02:58.651
in a fucking freezer
downstairs in the basement.

01:02:58.817 --> 01:03:00.615
Seneschal.

01:03:07.951 --> 01:03:09.749
Everything all right, sir?

01:03:09.911 --> 01:03:12.289

01:03:13.623 --> 01:03:15.921
I'll call you in the morning
when we'll be needing you.

01:03:16.084 --> 01:03:18.132
Very good, sir.

01:03:20.755 --> 01:03:22.598
Good evening, madam.

01:03:33.143 --> 01:03:34.941
Why did you kill him?

01:03:35.103 --> 01:03:38.277
Ever since the moment
that I met you...

01:03:40.150 --> 01:03:42.198
I thank God
you didn't love him.

01:03:46.323 --> 01:03:48.621
I wouldn't do
anything to hurt you.

01:03:48.783 --> 01:03:50.410
You have to believe that.

01:03:50.577 --> 01:03:52.454
Why did you kill him?

01:03:52.620 --> 01:03:54.588
Ganja, he tried to kill me.

01:03:54.748 --> 01:03:56.295
I did not kill him.

01:03:56.458 --> 01:03:59.337
So, he killed himself
and jumped in the freezer?

01:03:59.502 --> 01:04:00.623
Ganja, you're not listening.

01:04:00.712 --> 01:04:03.215
Your ex-husband
committed suicide.

01:04:03.381 --> 01:04:04.633
That's the honest truth.

01:04:04.799 --> 01:04:06.176
I swear to God.

01:04:11.514 --> 01:04:13.357
I believe you.

01:04:17.479 --> 01:04:19.573
I'm surprised
it didn't happen sooner.

01:04:36.748 --> 01:04:38.876
My three brothers
used to gang up on me.

01:04:41.628 --> 01:04:43.630
Beat me up when I was little.

01:04:46.758 --> 01:04:49.102
I'm the youngest
of four kids, so...

01:04:49.260 --> 01:04:52.059
I had a rough time growing up.

01:04:57.519 --> 01:05:00.443
One clay, I got into a huge fight
with my youngest brother.

01:05:02.107 --> 01:05:04.075
We called him Baby Jesus.

01:05:06.903 --> 01:05:09.247
He'd been picking on me all day.

01:05:11.366 --> 01:05:13.414
And finally, I'd had enough.

01:05:15.745 --> 01:05:17.588
I was fed up.

01:05:22.585 --> 01:05:24.508
I started throwing hands.

01:05:26.548 --> 01:05:29.973
It was an all-out donnybrook.
It was a proper brouhaha.

01:05:32.554 --> 01:05:34.898
And my brothers didn't stop it.

01:05:36.933 --> 01:05:38.810
They just kept cheering him on.

01:05:41.604 --> 01:05:45.609
And I was beating
his skinny black backside.

01:05:48.695 --> 01:05:50.447
And then he punched me...

01:05:52.991 --> 01:05:54.914
straight in the stomach.

01:06:00.123 --> 01:06:03.377
My mother beat him
to within an inch of his life.

01:06:06.713 --> 01:06:08.511
And she told him,

01:06:08.673 --> 01:06:11.802
"Don't you ever
hit a woman again,

01:06:11.968 --> 01:06:14.812
especially in her stomach."

01:06:20.143 --> 01:06:22.646
Later that night,
my dad came into my bedroom...

01:06:24.772 --> 01:06:27.116
to tuck me in.

01:06:27.275 --> 01:06:29.152
Check on me.

01:06:32.030 --> 01:06:33.657
He told me...

01:06:33.823 --> 01:06:36.497
"Baby Jesus was wrong."

01:06:39.078 --> 01:06:40.751
He loves you.

01:06:44.042 --> 01:06:45.589
We all love you.

01:06:48.546 --> 01:06:52.221
That this world
is a cruel, harsh place,

01:06:52.383 --> 01:06:54.681
especially for a black woman.

01:06:56.930 --> 01:06:59.934
And you're going to have to learn
to deal with the double whammy.

01:07:03.686 --> 01:07:05.859
You're gonna be
a woman one day soon,

01:07:06.022 --> 01:07:08.320
and you were born black.

01:07:11.486 --> 01:07:14.831
"Ganja's got to learn
to take care of Ganja."

01:07:18.868 --> 01:07:20.040
I said...

01:07:22.539 --> 01:07:24.962
"Daddy...

01:07:25.124 --> 01:07:26.592
it's not fair."

01:07:30.046 --> 01:07:32.094
And my father answered...

01:07:34.175 --> 01:07:35.392
"I know."

01:07:37.720 --> 01:07:39.393
Life's not fair.

01:07:41.933 --> 01:07:45.153
Life is as hard as steel.

01:07:46.896 --> 01:07:50.400
"Ganja has to take care
of Ganja."

01:07:54.571 --> 01:07:57.575
I've been taking care of myself
since I was seven years old.

01:08:10.795 --> 01:08:14.299
Why do you have his dead body
in the freezer?

01:08:17.635 --> 01:08:20.104
Answer me, for fuck's sake!

01:08:20.263 --> 01:08:22.765
( Chair legs scrape )

01:08:42.035 --> 01:08:44.412
Do you know what
your husband and I were working on?

01:08:44.578 --> 01:08:46.502
He never talked to me
about his work.

01:08:46.663 --> 01:08:50.885
He was assisting me on my study
of the ancient Ashanti culture.

01:08:51.044 --> 01:08:52.261
I've never heard of it.

01:08:52.420 --> 01:08:56.095
When I found his dead body,

01:08:56.256 --> 01:08:57.634
I took his blood.

01:08:57.800 --> 01:09:00.303
- Took it where?
- I drank it.

01:09:00.470 --> 01:09:01.470
Where did you take it?

01:09:01.638 --> 01:09:04.482
I said...

01:09:04.640 --> 01:09:05.733
I drank it.

01:09:05.892 --> 01:09:09.020
- You're insane.
- Ganja, no, I'm perfectly sane.

01:09:09.187 --> 01:09:11.484
- You're a freak!
- I'm not a freak.

01:09:11.648 --> 01:09:12.991
Then what are you?

01:09:13.149 --> 01:09:14.321
I'm an addict.

01:09:14.484 --> 01:09:15.906
Addicted to blood.

01:09:16.069 --> 01:09:18.367
Yes, people have many addictions.

01:09:20.238 --> 01:09:23.118

01:09:26.662 --> 01:09:29.086

01:09:29.247 --> 01:09:31.296
nicotine.

01:09:31.459 --> 01:09:32.801
And blood.

01:09:35.212 --> 01:09:37.307
- You're a vampire.
- What I am

01:09:37.465 --> 01:09:39.684
is in love with you.

Yes, you may.

You haven't changed a thing.

Yes, I do.

01:24:09.044 --> 01:24:12.048
Uh, this is my lovely bride Ganja.

01:24:12.214 --> 01:24:14.933
Ganja, Tangier.
Tangier, Ganja.

01:24:15.092 --> 01:24:17.561
Hello.

01:24:17.719 --> 01:24:19.938
Tangier...
like the city in Morocco?

01:24:20.097 --> 01:24:22.395
Yes, I was conceived there.

01:24:22.558 --> 01:24:23.810
A drink?

01:24:23.976 --> 01:24:25.603
Sure.

01:24:25.769 --> 01:24:27.567
Uh, allow me.

01:24:31.233 --> 01:24:32.405
( Cork pops )

01:24:40.826 --> 01:24:41.952
Hess?

01:24:42.119 --> 01:24:43.587
No, thank you.

01:24:57.426 --> 01:25:00.430
How long have you known Hess?

01:25:00.596 --> 01:25:03.315
We grew up together during
the summers here on the Vineyard.

01:25:03.473 --> 01:25:05.567
We used to date.

01:25:05.726 --> 01:25:07.945
Oh... is that so?

01:25:08.103 --> 01:25:10.276
True.

01:25:10.439 --> 01:25:11.656
What happened?

01:25:11.815 --> 01:25:13.783
The question is,
what didn't happen?

01:25:13.942 --> 01:25:15.285
That was a long time ago.

01:25:15.444 --> 01:25:18.323
It was a long, long time ago.

01:25:18.488 --> 01:25:20.582
But over the years,
we've maintained our friendship,

01:25:20.741 --> 01:25:23.790
so when I got the invitation for drinks,
I knew I'd accept,

01:25:23.952 --> 01:25:26.671
especially since I wasn't
invited to the wedding.

01:25:26.830 --> 01:25:28.628
It was a big oversight
on my part.

01:25:28.790 --> 01:25:31.509
I apologize.

01:25:31.668 --> 01:25:32.885
Apology accepted.

01:25:34.630 --> 01:25:36.348
Do you approve of Mrs. Greene?

01:25:36.506 --> 01:25:37.974
She all right.

01:25:38.133 --> 01:25:39.510
( laughs )

01:25:39.676 --> 01:25:41.974
No, she's very lovely.

01:25:42.137 --> 01:25:44.390
I'm happy for the both of you.

01:25:44.556 --> 01:25:46.650
So, Tangier...

01:25:48.435 --> 01:25:51.188
how do you feel about
the possibility of eternal life?

01:25:51.355 --> 01:25:52.823
What, you found the magic elixir?

01:25:52.981 --> 01:25:54.741
If you were given
the secret to eternal life,

01:25:54.816 --> 01:25:57.410
what would you do with it?

01:25:57.569 --> 01:25:59.822
I'd teach it to the children.

01:25:59.988 --> 01:26:02.286
- Hess: Why is that?
- Because in today's world,

01:26:02.449 --> 01:26:04.827
our black children
need to be indestructible.

01:26:04.993 --> 01:26:08.122
Sounds like something
my husband would say.

01:26:08.288 --> 01:26:11.007
And on that note,
if you ladies excuse me...

01:26:11.166 --> 01:26:13.294
Oh, no, Tangier,
for God's sake.

01:26:13.460 --> 01:26:14.507
I just have some reading to do.

01:26:14.670 --> 01:26:15.887
I should go.

01:26:16.046 --> 01:26:17.673
Please. Stay.

01:26:17.839 --> 01:26:20.683
You're sure?

01:26:20.842 --> 01:26:22.640
- We're sure.
- We're sure.

01:26:28.433 --> 01:26:31.027
No exchanging
war stories about me.

01:26:49.204 --> 01:26:50.456
( Door closes )

01:26:57.379 --> 01:26:58.631
Thank you.

01:27:05.387 --> 01:27:06.730
Cheers.

01:27:16.732 --> 01:27:18.575
Are you going to sit down,
or what?

01:27:34.583 --> 01:27:37.928
Why were you giving me
so much attitude?

01:27:38.086 --> 01:27:40.635
You really want to know?

01:27:40.797 --> 01:27:43.016
That's why I asked, bitch.

01:27:45.969 --> 01:27:47.391
( laughter)

01:27:50.223 --> 01:27:51.725
I'm a little bit jealous.

01:27:54.269 --> 01:27:55.441
Is that all?

01:27:55.604 --> 01:27:57.447
No.

01:27:57.606 --> 01:27:59.574
And?

01:27:59.733 --> 01:28:01.576
And I feel embarrassed.

01:28:03.570 --> 01:28:06.073
I make you feel embarrassed?

01:28:06.239 --> 01:28:08.708
Yes, but it's a good feeling.

01:28:25.634 --> 01:28:27.807
Would you like to dance?

01:28:27.969 --> 01:28:29.937
Where's the music?

01:28:30.096 --> 01:28:31.598
We don't need music.

01:28:45.487 --> 01:28:47.615
How long will you be
on the island?

01:28:47.781 --> 01:28:49.328
About another two weeks,

01:28:49.491 --> 01:28:52.995
and then I'm gonna close
my house up for the winter.

01:28:53.161 --> 01:28:55.038
Good.

01:28:55.205 --> 01:28:57.879
I'll have some
womanly companionship.

01:28:58.041 --> 01:29:00.135
It's very quiet here.

01:29:04.005 --> 01:29:06.349
Why didn't it work out
between you and Hess?

01:29:09.636 --> 01:29:11.855
We just moved in
two different directions.

01:29:12.013 --> 01:29:13.230
( <i>Chuckles</i> )

01:29:13.390 --> 01:29:16.064
- I know that feeling.
- Mm.

01:29:16.226 --> 01:29:17.648
How did you guys meet?

01:29:20.188 --> 01:29:22.816
We met through a mutual friend.

01:29:22.983 --> 01:29:26.157
Just turned out I got along
with Hess a lot better.

01:29:26.319 --> 01:29:28.162
Ah, it be's like that sometimes.

01:29:28.321 --> 01:29:29.948
( laughter)

01:29:35.704 --> 01:29:37.581
What color are your eyes?

01:29:37.747 --> 01:29:40.421
Blue.

01:29:40.584 --> 01:29:43.428
- Lovely.
- Thank you.

01:29:43.587 --> 01:29:45.931
My mom's black,
and my dad's Irish.

01:29:46.089 --> 01:29:47.591
Black Irish, there you go.

01:29:47.757 --> 01:29:49.304
( laughter)

01:30:09.738 --> 01:30:12.412
You have the most
beautiful skin.

01:30:14.451 --> 01:30:16.749
Do people tell you that?

01:30:16.912 --> 01:30:19.085
No.

01:30:19.247 --> 01:30:20.749
Well, they should.

01:30:22.584 --> 01:30:23.756
Thank you.

01:30:25.587 --> 01:30:28.386
People just get stuck
on the blue eyes

01:30:28.548 --> 01:30:31.893
like I am on your
beautiful red lips.
