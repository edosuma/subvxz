"To Alexandra."

01:07.693 --> 01:08.990
Hope you enjoy it.

01:09.278 --> 01:11.155
That's quite a display
you have here, George.

01:11.446 --> 01:12.538
Ah, thank you, sir,

01:12.823 --> 01:14.825
I hope to sell out Egypt fever, as it were.

01:15.117 --> 01:17.916
I had 50 extra copies printed
especially for this event.

01:18.203 --> 01:20.297
That's quite an investment, Constable.

01:20.581 --> 01:21.902
Well, I'm rather confident, sir.

01:22.082 --> 01:23.322
I don't suppose you had a chance

01:23.333 --> 01:24.853
lo peruse the copy I left on your desk.

01:24.918 --> 01:26.545
Yes, I did, George.

01:26.837 --> 01:28.464
You have quite a flair for the dramatic.

01:28.755 --> 01:29.972
Oh, excellent, sir.

01:30.257 --> 01:31.679
I was afraid it wasn't
going to be your cup of tea.

01:31.967 --> 01:33.719
"My Which?"

01:34.011 --> 01:35.010
Cup of tea, sir.

01:35.012 --> 01:36.184
It's an expression

01:36.471 --> 01:37.832
based on the assumption, I suppose,

01:38.015 --> 01:39.813
that a cup of tea is something one likes,

01:40.100 --> 01:42.979
so something one doesn't like isn't,

01:43.270 --> 01:44.692
if that...

01:44.980 --> 01:46.402
Don't be fooled by these thieves

01:46.690 --> 01:48.067
hiding behind the veil of science.

01:48.358 --> 01:50.486
Mr. Sharif, you again!

01:50.777 --> 01:52.120
Get out of here.

01:52.404 --> 01:53.326
Uxbridge.

01:53.614 --> 01:54.536
Come on, now.

01:54.823 --> 01:55.949
You'll only make it worse.

01:56.241 --> 01:57.367
You can keep me out,

01:57.659 --> 02:00.378
but you can never keep out
the curses of my ancestors.

02:00.662 --> 02:02.960
- Come on, please.
- I apologize, gentlemen.

02:03.248 --> 02:06.092
He's been following us
ever since we left Cairo.

02:06.376 --> 02:09.175
Ah, our patroness beckons.

02:09.463 --> 02:10.589
Excuse me, gentlemen.

02:13.300 --> 02:15.644
Sir, that was Desmond Rutherford.

02:15.927 --> 02:17.207
He's the leader of the expedition

02:17.387 --> 02:19.107
that found the Tomb of
the Unknown Princess.

02:19.181 --> 02:21.141
I had no idea you were
so well informed, George.

02:21.224 --> 02:22.646
Oh. Yes, sir, while I was writing my book,

02:22.934 --> 02:24.936
I read a great deal about
this very expedition.

02:25.228 --> 02:26.980
See that sickly gentleman right there?

02:27.272 --> 02:28.273
That's Phillip Uxbridge.

02:28.565 --> 02:30.158
He was the first man into the tomb.

02:30.442 --> 02:31.864
Hmm.

02:32.152 --> 02:33.592
Oh, and that's Dr. Alger Greenwood.

02:33.862 --> 02:34.738
Hello.

02:35.030 --> 02:36.907
He's an author...

02:37.199 --> 02:39.076
like myself.

02:39.368 --> 02:41.746
Quite an event, wouldn't
you say, Detective?

02:42.037 --> 02:43.084
Indeed it is, Doctor.

02:43.372 --> 02:46.091
It's not every day we have
a 3,000-year-old sarcophagus

02:46.375 --> 02:47.752
opened before our very eyes.

02:48.043 --> 02:49.260
You can thank the ladies

02:49.544 --> 02:51.224
of the Toronto Historical Society for that.

02:51.296 --> 02:52.297
<i>. Oh.</i>

02:52.589 --> 02:53.869
The Toronto Historical Society?

02:53.965 --> 02:56.309
I bet! They would enjoy a good book.

02:56.593 --> 02:58.593
I should go join the
ladies, If you'll excuse me.

02:58.637 --> 03:00.355
Yes, of course.

03:00.639 --> 03:01.982
It's a rollicking tale

03:02.265 --> 03:03.985
but, I warn you, not
for the faint of heart.

03:04.184 --> 03:07.859
Are you experienced with adventure novels?

03:19.616 --> 03:21.869
It's very beautiful.

03:22.160 --> 03:24.254
My favorite-a royal couple,

03:24.538 --> 03:27.257
in love, it seems.

03:27.541 --> 03:29.839
New Kingdom, is it not'?

03:30.127 --> 03:31.219
Yes.

03:31.503 --> 03:32.755
You have a good eye, Mister...

03:33.046 --> 03:34.514
Murdoch, William Murdoch.

03:34.798 --> 03:36.766
Dr. Iris Bajjali.

03:37.050 --> 03:38.049
A doctor?

03:38.051 --> 03:39.928
Yes, of archeology.

03:40.220 --> 03:41.688
<i>. Oh.</i>

03:41.972 --> 03:44.066
Attention, please.

03:44.349 --> 03:46.147
Please excuse me, Mr. Murdoch.

03:50.689 --> 03:53.067
Ladies and gentlemen, thank
you so much for coming.

03:53.358 --> 03:56.783
And thank you to our patroness,

03:57.070 --> 03:59.493
Mrs. Xavier McAllister.

04:01.032 --> 04:02.329
Because of her largesse,

04:02.617 --> 04:04.577
the fine city of Toronto
will have the distinction

04:04.661 --> 04:06.254
of welcoming the Unknown Princess

04:06.538 --> 04:07.915
to our modern age

04:08.206 --> 04:10.755
and on the brink of a new century.

04:12.335 --> 04:13.712
Dr. Iris Bajjali,

04:14.004 --> 04:15.472
may I prevail upon you to continue?

04:15.756 --> 04:17.349
Thank you.

04:17.632 --> 04:19.430
While we do not know her identity,

04:19.718 --> 04:20.890
we are quite certain

04:21.178 --> 04:22.646
that the occupant of this sarcophagus

04:22.929 --> 04:25.227
is of royal lineage.

04:25.515 --> 04:28.894
And now. Without further
ado, Professor Alger Greenwood

04:29.186 --> 04:31.405
will do us the honor of
welcoming the royal lady

04:31.688 --> 04:33.986
back to our earthly realm.

04:47.412 --> 04:49.414
Perhaps our princess is a little shy.

05:09.392 --> 05:10.434
Ah!

05:10.435 --> 05:12.028
Alger?

05:12.312 --> 05:13.108
Alger.

05:17.025 --> 05:18.402
Doctor?

05:18.693 --> 05:20.036
He's dead.

05:20.320 --> 05:22.368
I can't believe it.

05:22.656 --> 05:24.658
I can.

05:30.205 --> 05:32.003
Sir, do you suppose that the snake,

05:32.290 --> 05:34.042
having been buried with the princess,

05:34.334 --> 05:36.428
was actually under some sort of spell?

05:36.711 --> 05:37.678
A spell, George?

05:37.963 --> 05:39.483
Yes, sir, not unlike Sleeping Beauty.

05:39.631 --> 05:40.598
George.

05:40.882 --> 05:42.162
Sir, the snake was put to sleep

05:42.217 --> 05:44.561
as a protector of the princess.

05:44.845 --> 05:46.285
When Mr. Greenwood opened the coffin,

05:46.471 --> 05:49.190
the snake reanimated and attacked.

05:49.474 --> 05:52.944
George, let's find the
snake first, shall we?

05:53.228 --> 05:54.150
Take Henry with you.

05:54.437 --> 05:56.110
And, gentlemen, use the utmost caution.

05:56.398 --> 05:57.397
Yes, sir.

05:57.399 --> 05:58.440
Higgins?

05:58.441 --> 06:00.193
Sir, if the two of us went,

06:00.485 --> 06:02.829
wouldn't we just alarm
the thing even further?

06:03.113 --> 06:04.990
Oh, Henry, come along.

06:19.588 --> 06:20.635
You know, Henry,

06:20.922 --> 06:22.595
my Aunt Primrose once caught a snake

06:22.883 --> 06:24.476
with her bare hands.

06:24.759 --> 06:26.227
An Egyptian snake?

06:26.511 --> 06:28.112
No, of course not, Don't be ridiculous.

06:28.263 --> 06:30.383
What would an Egyptian snake
be doing in Peterborough?

06:32.017 --> 06:33.297
What do you think you're doing?

06:33.393 --> 06:35.316
Don't touch that.

06:35.604 --> 06:37.572
Detective Murdoch, Toronto Constabulary.

06:37.856 --> 06:40.234
I hardly think this is
a matter for the police.

06:42.068 --> 06:44.241
Sir, who had access to this sarcophagus?

06:44.529 --> 06:46.281
Oh, everyone, unfortunately.

06:46.573 --> 06:49.167
The security in this hall is appalling.

06:49.451 --> 06:50.919
And who knew that
Greenwood would be the one

06:51.202 --> 06:52.162
to open the sarcophagus?

06:52.329 --> 06:55.082
It was certainly no secret.

06:57.959 --> 07:00.462
Uxbridge?

07:00.754 --> 07:03.633
See to the detective. I'll deal with this.

07:03.924 --> 07:05.847
Gentlemen, I assure you, the
workplace is perfectly safe.

07:06.134 --> 07:07.181
No, no.

07:07.469 --> 07:08.971
Gentlemen, I... No, no.

07:10.805 --> 07:14.150
Mr. Uxbridge, why are your workers leaving?

07:14.434 --> 07:16.812
We are all cursed for what we've done.

07:17.103 --> 07:18.275
Cursed?

07:18.563 --> 07:22.113
Beware Queen Maat.

07:23.902 --> 07:25.950
Uxbridge, pull yourself together, man.

07:26.237 --> 07:28.285
Sir, I must insist that you refrain

07:28.573 --> 07:29.870
from distressing my employees.

07:30.158 --> 07:33.037
And I must insist that
you shut down this exhibit.

07:33.328 --> 07:34.921
Shutdown the exhibit?

07:35.205 --> 07:36.206
That's impossible.

07:36.498 --> 07:37.898
Out of respect for poor Greenwood.

07:38.166 --> 07:40.419
Greenwood would be appalled at the idea.

07:40.710 --> 07:42.508
In that case, the sarcophagus
will be coming with me

07:42.796 --> 07:44.298
for further analysis.

07:44.589 --> 07:46.091
That's absurd.

07:46.383 --> 07:48.886
Sir, if you do not allow me
to examine evidence further,

07:49.177 --> 07:50.303
I will have to arrest you

07:50.595 --> 07:52.768
for impeding a police investigation.

07:54.474 --> 07:57.068
This will not be the last you hear of this.

08:00.981 --> 08:02.449
George, I don't want to hear
any more about this curse.

08:02.732 --> 08:03.904
Hear me out, Higgins. I'm telling you.

08:04.192 --> 08:05.944
I've learned a great deal
from the writing of my novel.

08:06.236 --> 08:07.203
Yes, your novel-

08:07.487 --> 08:08.739
I was wondering when you
were gonna bring it up.

08:09.030 --> 08:11.579
Oh, you mock all you like.
I've sold 20 books so far.

08:11.866 --> 08:14.027
- Well, I hope you didn't offer a money
- Back guarantee.

08:14.035 --> 08:16.584
Have you even read it?

08:16.871 --> 08:17.997
Of course, George.

08:18.289 --> 08:20.462
Oh, really?

08:20.750 --> 08:21.910
What was your favorite part'?

08:22.002 --> 08:23.323
I liked the part with the mummy.

08:23.503 --> 08:24.543
Yes, that was very good.

08:24.671 --> 08:25.843
Also, the, uh-

08:26.131 --> 08:27.257
snake.

08:27.549 --> 08:28.892
Oh, Henry, there was no snake in my novel.

08:29.175 --> 08:30.142
You know, if you haven'! Read it,

08:30.427 --> 08:31.394
you could just say.

08:31.678 --> 08:32.804
George, the snake.

08:41.062 --> 08:42.582
And I mean very carefully, gentlemen.

08:42.856 --> 08:45.200
This sarcophagus is
priceless and very delicate.

08:45.483 --> 08:47.003
It has no business in a police station.

08:47.027 --> 08:48.427
I'm sorry. But I have to determine

08:48.653 --> 08:50.280
how the snake gained entrance.

08:50.572 --> 08:52.252
Well, they do have an astonishing ability

08:52.532 --> 08:54.159
to squeeze into the minutest of openings.

08:54.451 --> 08:56.044
The princess will be safe.

08:56.327 --> 08:57.419
Have no worry.

08:57.704 --> 09:00.127
Although I am surprised you've concluded

09:00.415 --> 09:01.758
that she's only a princess.

09:02.042 --> 09:03.840
The circumstances surrounding her burial

09:04.127 --> 09:07.256
would suggest that she's of
a higher, more powerful rank.

09:08.339 --> 09:10.888
My thoughts exactly.

09:11.176 --> 09:14.555
But the hieroglyphs are very clear.

09:14.846 --> 09:16.940
They tell us everything except her name.

09:18.349 --> 09:19.441
An interesting puzzle.

09:19.726 --> 09:23.151
One worthy of a detective, perhaps.

09:24.355 --> 09:25.402
Sir...

09:26.775 --> 09:27.697
We found the snake.

09:27.984 --> 09:28.983
Where is it?

09:28.985 --> 09:29.986
It got away, sir.

09:30.987 --> 09:32.534
Oh, no, it didn't.

09:33.823 --> 09:34.870
It followed you.

09:35.158 --> 09:37.911
<i>Malish, malish, malish.</i>

09:38.203 --> 09:41.503
Every Egyptian child must
learn to handle a cobra.

09:41.790 --> 09:43.167
Would you like to...

09:43.458 --> 09:45.418
If you could somehow
package that for transport,

09:45.627 --> 09:46.787
it would be most appreciated.

09:47.003 --> 09:48.004
Transport?

09:48.296 --> 09:49.513
To the police station.

09:49.798 --> 09:53.302
Oh, surely you do not intend
on questioning the creature.

09:53.593 --> 09:56.392
In a manner of speaking.

09:57.889 --> 10:00.017
I haven't done a dissection since school

10:00.308 --> 10:02.857
and never on such a specimen.

10:03.144 --> 10:04.316
And Mr. Greenwood?

10:04.604 --> 10:06.732
As it appears, he died
from the poisonous bite

10:07.023 --> 10:08.024
of the Naja haje.

10:08.316 --> 10:09.356
The Egyptian cobra, yes?

10:09.609 --> 10:10.906
Native to northern Africa.

10:11.194 --> 10:13.162
As far as we know, we have
yet to discover a cobra

10:13.446 --> 10:14.572
in the Canadian wild.

10:14.864 --> 10:16.344
But it would be possible for someone

10:16.366 --> 10:17.788
to keep one as a pet.

10:18.076 --> 10:19.756
It would, in fact, make an excellent pet,

10:19.869 --> 10:22.543
as it can go for several
months without requiring food.

10:22.831 --> 10:25.300
So the cobra could have
entered the sarcophagus in Egypt

10:25.583 --> 10:27.802
and have survived the voyage.

10:28.086 --> 10:29.258
Undoubtedly.

10:29.546 --> 10:31.298
<i>However.â€œ...</i>

10:35.760 --> 10:37.353
It ate recently.

10:37.637 --> 10:38.684
It appears so-

10:38.972 --> 10:41.145
a mouse, by the looks of it.

10:41.432 --> 10:43.059
That doesn't look like any mouse.

10:43.351 --> 10:44.853
You might be right, Detective.

10:45.145 --> 10:47.147
I will endeavor to identify it.

10:48.857 --> 10:50.359
But the question still remains,

10:50.650 --> 10:53.699
how did both of these creatures
enter a sealed sarcophagus?

10:53.987 --> 10:57.617
I'm afraid that question
is outside my expertise.

10:58.616 --> 10:59.788
I am late for an engagement

11:00.076 --> 11:02.579
I bid you good evening, Detective.

11:15.758 --> 11:17.359
Will you be needing anything else, sir?

11:17.594 --> 11:19.813
No, George.

11:20.096 --> 11:21.177
A special occasion, George?

11:21.306 --> 11:22.774
Oh, this?

11:23.057 --> 11:26.061
A bookseller has asked me to
attend an autograph session

11:26.352 --> 11:28.104
at his establishment this evening, sir.

11:28.396 --> 11:30.774
It seems Curse of the Pharaohs
has become a bestseller.

11:31.065 --> 11:32.545
Well, that's very good news, George.

11:32.609 --> 11:34.577
Congratulations, Thank you, sir.

11:34.861 --> 11:36.781
Well, I imagine you're
busy, but if you're not,

11:36.946 --> 11:37.946
would you like to attend?

11:37.947 --> 11:39.870
I'd be delighted.

11:43.995 --> 11:46.714
I am very honored to
present to you this evening

11:46.998 --> 11:50.172
the personal servant
of the Unknown Princess.

11:50.460 --> 11:52.337
She would have been ritually killed

11:52.629 --> 11:54.973
in order to continue on
in service lo her mistress

11:55.256 --> 11:56.803
for all eternity.

11:57.091 --> 11:58.934
Hmm, what do you say to that, Mary?

11:59.219 --> 12:01.517
If I die, will you come with me?

12:03.097 --> 12:05.441
The servant was the guardian of the tomb.

12:05.725 --> 12:08.444
It was the first mummy we discovered.

12:08.728 --> 12:12.449
Do we imagine that the curse
extends to the servant mummies

12:12.732 --> 12:14.109
as well as royalty?

12:14.400 --> 12:16.994
No, there is no curse, Mrs. McAllister.

12:17.278 --> 12:19.827
It is merely a folktale
designed to deter tomb robbers.

12:20.114 --> 12:21.113
Ah.

12:21.115 --> 12:23.413
Ah, come now, ladies.

12:23.701 --> 12:25.169
Let us begin the unwrapping

12:25.453 --> 12:30.300
so that the glory of Egypt
can be experienced firsthand.

12:35.421 --> 12:38.595
And now, ladies, I must depart.

12:38.883 --> 12:39.930
Duty calls.

12:40.218 --> 12:42.141
But I leave you in the capable hands

12:42.428 --> 12:43.896
of Dr. Bajjali'

12:47.642 --> 12:49.064
Mrs. McAllister,

12:49.352 --> 12:52.481
if you would do us the
honor of unwrapping her.

12:52.772 --> 12:54.570
Where should I begin?

12:54.857 --> 12:56.859
Wherever you like.

13:00.488 --> 13:02.206
I hope it won't look too hideous.

13:02.490 --> 13:04.618
We are dependent upon
the skill of the embalmer.

13:04.909 --> 13:06.502
Ah.

13:13.835 --> 13:15.007
Mrs. McAllister'?

13:15.295 --> 13:16.592
Mrs. McAllister'

13:16.879 --> 13:18.381
Give us some air, please.

13:23.303 --> 13:24.520
Can I help'?

13:24.804 --> 13:26.147
No, you can't.

13:26.431 --> 13:28.684
I'm afraid she's dead.

13:38.818 --> 13:40.320
What exactly happened?

13:40.611 --> 13:42.329
Mrs. McAllister was unwrapping the mummy,

13:42.613 --> 13:43.409
then collapsed.

13:43.698 --> 13:44.540
She died instantly.

13:44.824 --> 13:45.666
Any idea why?

13:45.950 --> 13:48.078
I would suggest a heart attack,

13:48.369 --> 13:50.167
brought on, possibly, by over-excitement.

13:50.455 --> 13:52.082
- I'll take the post
- Mortem results

13:52.373 --> 13:54.842
as soon as you have them, please.

14:03.426 --> 14:05.770
Detective, I'm surprised to see you here.

14:06.054 --> 14:08.557
We investigate all suspicious deaths.

14:08.848 --> 14:10.350
Suspicious?

14:10.641 --> 14:12.268
Two mummies, two deaths-

14:12.560 --> 14:13.812
it does raise an eyebrow.

14:14.103 --> 14:17.152
May I ask why you're here?

14:17.440 --> 14:20.489
Mrs. McAllister was a great
friend of the expedition.

14:20.777 --> 14:25.032
Her contributions were substantial.

14:25.323 --> 14:28.372
<i>This mummy was meant
to be a thank-you gift.</i>

14:28.659 --> 14:32.129
Seems somewhat macabre.

14:32.413 --> 14:34.256
She was adamant

14:34.540 --> 14:37.544
on having an unwrapping party in her salon.

14:37.835 --> 14:40.964
They used to be all the rage in London.

14:41.255 --> 14:43.053
So we were to oblige her.

14:43.341 --> 14:44.593
On whose authority'?

14:44.884 --> 14:46.181
Mr. Rutherford's, of course.

14:46.469 --> 14:49.348
But Mr. Rutherford isn't in attendance.

14:49.639 --> 14:51.266
No, but he was.

14:51.557 --> 14:53.025
He left just before the incident.

14:53.309 --> 14:55.107
Really'? Do you know why?

14:55.395 --> 14:57.898
Something related to
the exhibit, I imagine.

15:00.400 --> 15:02.198
And Mr. Uxbridge?

15:02.485 --> 15:04.032
Phillip only just arrived

15:04.320 --> 15:06.698
<i>to transport the mummy back to the exhibit.</i>

15:11.369 --> 15:12.249
What have you, George?

15:12.537 --> 15:13.663
Sir, sales remain brisk.

15:13.955 --> 15:15.878
All these women are ardent fans.

15:17.375 --> 15:20.219
Also, none of them saw
anything out of the ordinary.

15:20.503 --> 15:22.344
It would seem, sir, that
she just dropped dead.

15:22.547 --> 15:23.639
Right, then.

15:23.923 --> 15:25.323
I'll need you to transport the mummy

15:25.591 --> 15:26.808
back to the station house.

15:27.093 --> 15:28.265
Is that really necessary'?

15:28.553 --> 15:30.055
She is extremely fragile.

15:30.346 --> 15:31.313
I'm afraid so.

15:31.597 --> 15:34.066
Well, then at least allow Mr. Uxbridge

15:34.350 --> 15:35.818
to help you with the transport.

15:36.102 --> 15:37.979
He knows how to handle her properly.

15:38.271 --> 15:39.864
Iris, we can't let this continue.

15:40.148 --> 15:41.570
We have to send it all back-

15:41.858 --> 15:43.405
Queen Maat, the curse.

15:43.693 --> 15:45.866
Phillip, please, not now.

15:46.154 --> 15:48.373
The constable needs your help.

15:54.412 --> 15:55.834
Mr. Uxbridge, are you all right?

15:56.122 --> 15:57.499
You look quite unwell.

15:57.790 --> 15:59.337
It's the curse.

15:59.625 --> 16:00.842
The curse of the pharaohs?

16:01.127 --> 16:03.505
No, the curse of Queen Maat.

16:03.796 --> 16:04.922
It's real.

16:05.214 --> 16:07.091
Ifs happening to me.

16:09.093 --> 16:11.562
Ifs a very old story.

16:11.846 --> 16:14.690
Queen Maat knew she was
so disliked by her people

16:14.974 --> 16:16.521
that she created a curse

16:16.809 --> 16:19.528
lo protect her passage to the underworld.

16:19.812 --> 16:21.359
Yes, I believe I've heard this story.

16:21.647 --> 16:24.821
If I'm not mistaken, a
series of fatal calamities

16:25.109 --> 16:27.862
is to befall anyone who
has defiled her tomb.

16:28.154 --> 16:29.906
I was the second man in the tomb.

16:30.198 --> 16:33.077
The second stage is happening to me.

16:33.367 --> 16:35.087
Well, I thought you were the first man in.

16:38.789 --> 16:40.666
It was Burrows.

16:42.043 --> 16:44.637
Mr. Uxbridge, I'll fetch Dr. Grace.

16:44.921 --> 16:47.094
No doctor can save me.

16:49.175 --> 16:52.520
The only way to break the curse

16:52.803 --> 16:56.558
was to return the mummy to her tomb.

16:56.849 --> 16:58.851
It is said that the curse of Queen Maat

16:59.143 --> 17:01.521
protects all the royal women of Egypt.

17:01.812 --> 17:05.942
Maat is the goddess of law
and justice, is she not?

17:07.401 --> 17:09.449
Quite so.

17:09.737 --> 17:11.830
How fitting that you know of her.

17:13.950 --> 17:16.544
Queen Maat, however, as
a human ruler of Egypt,

17:16.827 --> 17:18.079
never actually existed,

17:18.371 --> 17:23.502
so obviously the curse
doesn't exist either.

17:23.792 --> 17:25.295
Although...

17:27.505 --> 17:28.927
<i>Yes'?</i>

17:29.215 --> 17:31.058
No, nothing at all.

17:44.146 --> 17:45.443
It's a Greater Egyptian Gerbil,

17:45.731 --> 17:49.577
not to be confused with
the Lesser Egyptian Gerbil.

17:49.860 --> 17:52.079
I take it the species is
not native to North America.

17:52.363 --> 17:53.330
North Africa,

17:53.614 --> 17:55.082
which means it's likely the gerbil

17:55.366 --> 17:57.334
found its way into the sarcophagus

17:57.618 --> 17:58.995
with the snake in Egypt,

17:59.287 --> 18:00.630
perhaps quite innocently,

18:00.913 --> 18:03.416
by means of a small hole, for example.

18:03.708 --> 18:06.131
Well, if so, I've yet to find it.

18:06.419 --> 18:07.939
Have you finished with Mrs. McAllister?

18:08.045 --> 18:09.262
It's quite as I suspected.

18:09.547 --> 18:10.969
She died of a heart attack.

18:11.257 --> 18:13.009
No poisons or other triggers?

18:13.301 --> 18:16.396
Nothing at all. Her death
was perfectly natural.

18:16.679 --> 18:18.999
Are you quite sure, Doctor,
that there was no foul play'?

18:19.098 --> 18:20.441
Absolutely.

18:20.725 --> 18:23.023
Unless, of course, this
mummy was cursed after all.

18:25.187 --> 18:27.656
I'd like you to revisit your conclusion.

18:27.940 --> 18:29.237
Detective, I can assure you,

18:29.525 --> 18:32.199
I completed the assessment
fully and to the letter.

18:32.486 --> 18:33.807
I have no doubt in your ability.

18:34.030 --> 18:35.373
Dr. Ogden's recommendation

18:35.656 --> 18:37.078
is quite sufficient in that regard.

18:37.366 --> 18:40.461
However, I must insist that
you re-examine Mrs. McAllister'

18:40.745 --> 18:42.213
And what am I looking for'?

18:42.496 --> 18:45.249
Whatever it is you missed the first time.

18:59.013 --> 19:00.014
Buzz.

19:01.432 --> 19:03.935
Looks like a bloody museum in here.

19:04.226 --> 19:06.103
So what have you discovered?

19:06.395 --> 19:07.738
I've been unable to determine

19:08.022 --> 19:10.116
how the snake got in the sarcophagus,

19:10.399 --> 19:13.118
<i>and my tests on the second
mummy haven't yielded any cause</i>

19:13.402 --> 19:14.995
for Mrs. McAllister's heart attack.

19:15.279 --> 19:16.451
So nothing at all.

19:16.739 --> 19:18.867
Well, I'm convinced
there's an explanation, sir.

19:19.158 --> 19:20.205
I just have to find it.

19:23.829 --> 19:24.705
I always knew I had it in me.

19:24.997 --> 19:26.544
- Well done.
- Congratulations.

19:30.753 --> 19:31.970
Good news, George?

19:32.254 --> 19:33.346
Indeed, sir.

19:33.631 --> 19:35.711
Ii seems this curse has
whetted the public's appetite

19:35.800 --> 19:36.800
for a good Egyptian yarn.

19:37.009 --> 19:39.933
My books going into a
second printing as we speak.

19:40.221 --> 19:42.519
Ah, Inspector, would
you like a signed copy,

19:42.807 --> 19:43.928
one for the missus, perhaps?

19:44.141 --> 19:45.734
It's proving to be most
popular with the ladies.

19:46.018 --> 19:47.520
What I'd like for you
to remember, Crabtree,

19:47.812 --> 19:49.252
is that while you're in this station,

19:49.438 --> 19:50.564
you're a policeman,

19:50.856 --> 19:52.608
exclusively!

19:52.900 --> 19:53.742
Is that a yes?

19:54.026 --> 19:55.147
That's a â€œ get back to work

19:55.277 --> 19:56.638
"before I take that uniform off you

19:56.654 --> 19:58.156
and stick it on that bloody mummy!"

19:58.447 --> 20:01.542
Sirs, I wanted to speak to you
about the legend of Queen Meat.

20:01.826 --> 20:03.078
Oh, here we go.

20:03.369 --> 20:05.369
I came upon the legend
while researching my book.

20:05.371 --> 20:06.918
Bloody hell, Crabtree.

20:07.206 --> 20:10.301
We've had werewolves, voodoo,
vampires, and now mummies.

20:10.584 --> 20:11.676
It's all bollocks.

20:11.961 --> 20:13.304
I beg to differ, sir.

20:13.587 --> 20:16.591
Mummies have been cursing
people since as early as 1699,

20:16.882 --> 20:18.162
when a Frenchman, Louis Penicher,

20:18.426 --> 20:20.269
reported that a ship
transporting two mummies

20:20.553 --> 20:22.681
was plagued by extraordinarily stormy seas

20:22.972 --> 20:24.974
until the mummies were thrown overboard.

20:25.266 --> 20:26.768
French bloody sissies.

20:27.059 --> 20:29.437
Sir, Dr. Bajjali mentioned
the curse to me as well.

20:29.729 --> 20:31.009
Perhaps it will yield us a clue.

20:31.188 --> 20:32.314
This is my thinking, sir.

20:32.606 --> 20:34.167
Now, Uxbridge claims that he was present

20:34.400 --> 20:35.697
at the beginning of the curse.

20:35.985 --> 20:37.783
In fact, he himself
believes to be afflicted.

20:38.070 --> 20:39.447
Obviously a reliable source.

20:39.739 --> 20:41.332
Go on, George.

20:41.615 --> 20:43.709
Well, sir. Uxbridge
whispered something in my ear

20:43.993 --> 20:45.461
about Burrows, and then he left.

20:45.745 --> 20:46.871
Burrows'?

20:47.163 --> 20:48.764
It turns out there was a Luther Burrows

20:48.873 --> 20:49.954
attached to the expedition.

20:49.999 --> 20:51.171
Where is he now?

20:51.459 --> 20:53.336
He's dead, sir. He died of a fever.

20:53.627 --> 20:54.970
And it turns out Phillip Uxbridge

20:55.254 --> 20:56.654
was not the first man into the tomb.

20:56.672 --> 20:58.720
It was Burrows, and he
died shortly thereafter.

20:59.008 --> 20:59.975
Let me guess.

21:00.259 --> 21:01.419
That was a part of the curse?

21:02.553 --> 21:04.273
Sirs, I've taken the
liberty of writing down

21:04.555 --> 21:06.728
the stages of the curse on this chalkboard.

21:07.016 --> 21:09.815
As you can see, we've already
got some corroboration.

21:10.102 --> 21:11.604
The first three stages of the curse

21:11.896 --> 21:13.239
have already been fulfilled.

21:13.522 --> 21:15.900
Death by brain fire"-

21:16.192 --> 21:17.284
a fever, that was Burrows?

21:17.568 --> 21:18.990
The first man into the tomb.

21:19.278 --> 21:21.155
"Suffering that never ends."

21:21.447 --> 21:23.167
Uxbridge believes that to be himself, sir,

21:23.365 --> 21:24.405
and clearly he's suffering

21:24.575 --> 21:25.896
from some sort of strange illness.

21:25.910 --> 21:28.254
"Bite of an asp."

21:28.537 --> 21:30.164
Are you sure you didn't
just make this up, Crabtree?

21:30.456 --> 21:31.332
No, sir.

21:31.624 --> 21:33.664
Now, the fourth stage is
somewhat harder to explain:

21:33.709 --> 21:35.086
"â€œThe cessation of the soul."

21:35.377 --> 21:36.344
Seems an odd one to me.

21:36.629 --> 21:38.190
- And the fifth?
- Stranger, again, sir.

21:38.214 --> 21:39.214
"Â€œThe revenge of Anubis."

21:39.298 --> 21:40.390
- Who?
- Anubis, sir.

21:40.674 --> 21:42.017
A god of the underworld.

21:42.301 --> 21:44.599
It's said he guides souls on their journey.

21:44.887 --> 21:46.448
Yes, sir, he had the head of a jackal.

21:46.680 --> 21:47.852
Of course he did.

21:48.140 --> 21:49.266
Excuse me, sirs.

21:49.558 --> 21:51.356
We've found the owner of the snake,

21:51.644 --> 21:54.488
one Fouad Sharif.

21:54.772 --> 21:57.241
Leave our ancestors at peace.

21:59.944 --> 22:02.242
Gentlemen, I am completely within my rights

22:02.530 --> 22:03.827
to protest peacefully.

22:04.114 --> 22:06.958
Mr. Sharif, what can
you tell me about snakes,

22:07.243 --> 22:09.086
specifically an Egyptian cobra?

22:09.370 --> 22:12.249
The sacred asp is a symbol of the pharaohs,

22:12.540 --> 22:15.544
to be feared and worshipped
as one and the same.

22:15.835 --> 22:16.882
Indeed.

22:17.169 --> 22:19.046
You boarded a steamer in Liverpool

22:19.338 --> 22:22.217
with one such snake in your
possession, did you not?

22:22.508 --> 22:24.135
It was a gift from my grandfather

22:24.426 --> 22:27.475
to help remind me of my duty.

22:27.763 --> 22:30.607
Strange, then, that when
you made land in Halifax,

22:30.891 --> 22:32.252
the stewards account of the luggage

22:32.434 --> 22:33.902
made no mention of this basket.

22:34.186 --> 22:35.779
Yes, it went missing.

22:36.063 --> 22:37.736
You didn't report it?

22:38.023 --> 22:40.651
It seemed unwise to cause a panic.

22:40.943 --> 22:43.492
You're aware that you
were on the same sailing

22:43.779 --> 22:45.406
transporting the Rutherford expedition.

22:45.698 --> 22:46.995
Of course.

22:47.283 --> 22:49.411
How am I to object to the
desecration of my culture

22:49.702 --> 22:52.455
if I cannot confront
the vandals themselves?

22:52.746 --> 22:54.840
Perhaps you're also aware of how your cobra

22:55.124 --> 22:58.298
managed to enter their sealed sarcophagus.

22:58.586 --> 22:59.929
I am not.

23:00.212 --> 23:02.635
Do you know of the curse of Queen Maat'?

23:02.923 --> 23:07.770
You westerners are all so simpleminded.

23:08.053 --> 23:10.522
The curse is on you

23:10.806 --> 23:14.185
for refusing to acknowledge
that to defile our dead

23:14.476 --> 23:17.104
is an abomination against all humanity.

23:17.396 --> 23:19.694
Detective, I'm glad you're here.

23:19.982 --> 23:21.950
You are a disgrace to our homeland.

23:22.234 --> 23:23.827
I could say the same about you.

23:25.362 --> 23:26.443
Lay a hand on this woman,

23:26.572 --> 23:29.041
and I will have you behind bars.

23:29.325 --> 23:31.373
Please, leave him be.

23:31.660 --> 23:35.130
I provoked him. I should have known better.

23:35.414 --> 23:38.008
Would you have a moment to talk?

23:38.292 --> 23:40.044
Yes, of course.

23:40.336 --> 23:44.341
George, I want a 24-hour
watch on Mr. Sharif.

23:44.632 --> 23:46.100
I want to know his every move.

23:46.383 --> 23:47.635
Yes, sir.

23:52.932 --> 23:55.981
And now with this visit to North America,

23:56.268 --> 23:59.772
I can say I have set foot
on all five continents.

24:00.064 --> 24:02.032
Incredible adventures, Dr. Bajjali.

24:02.316 --> 24:03.818
Please, call me Iris.

24:04.109 --> 24:06.703
Iris.

24:06.987 --> 24:09.615
This has been a welcome
respite from the exhibit.

24:09.907 --> 24:11.909
Oh, why is that'?

24:12.201 --> 24:14.579
It is quickly becoming a sideshow.

24:14.870 --> 24:16.964
Desmond Rutherford is
so focused on the money

24:17.247 --> 24:18.590
this exhibit is bringing in,

24:18.874 --> 24:22.219
he has decided not to
bother returning to Egypt.

24:22.503 --> 24:24.426
Is that so?

24:24.713 --> 24:25.680
It look me years

24:25.965 --> 24:28.935
to get on an expeditionary team over there.

24:29.218 --> 24:30.218
Because you're a woman.

24:30.469 --> 24:31.812
Mm.

24:32.096 --> 24:34.224
I suppose, I shouldn't complain.

24:34.515 --> 24:37.485
At least I'm not lying dead
like poor Mrs. McAllister.

24:38.936 --> 24:40.062
Have you any news of what killed her'?

24:40.354 --> 24:42.573
A heart attack, it would seem.

24:42.856 --> 24:44.984
Oh, how very tragic.

24:45.275 --> 24:49.451
In ancient Egypt, the heart
was thought to house the soul.

24:49.738 --> 24:51.991
As in, "the cessation of the soul"?

24:52.992 --> 24:55.586
From the curse of Queen Maat.

24:55.869 --> 24:58.497
Yes, I suppose a heart attack would fit.

24:58.789 --> 25:00.336
Do you believe in the curse?

25:02.001 --> 25:04.481
Do you not find contradictions
between your religious beliefs

25:04.753 --> 25:05.845
and scientific truths?

25:06.130 --> 25:07.882
That doesn't quite answer my question.

25:09.717 --> 25:11.390
I am a woman of science.

25:11.677 --> 25:13.600
Everything has an explanation,

25:13.887 --> 25:17.892
though there is a
certain allure in the idea

25:18.183 --> 25:19.480
that the responsibility of choice

25:19.768 --> 25:21.441
is out of our control.

25:21.729 --> 25:25.905
Perhaps, but that isn't my cup of tea.

25:27.026 --> 25:29.654
Your cup of tea?

25:29.945 --> 25:31.788
What I mean to say is... Thank you, sir.

25:32.072 --> 25:35.417
Mummy princess cursing Toronto.

25:38.537 --> 25:40.210
Thank you, sir.

25:44.960 --> 25:46.382
The afternoon edition, I...

25:46.670 --> 25:48.798
I think it turned out rather well.

25:49.089 --> 25:50.511
You mean you knew about this?

25:50.799 --> 25:51.846
I rather think I'm aware

25:52.134 --> 25:53.761
of when my photograph is being taken.

25:54.053 --> 25:55.533
Do you realize the kind of attention

25:55.596 --> 25:56.597
this is going to attract?

25:56.889 --> 25:58.732
The overwhelming kind, I hope.

25:59.016 --> 26:00.518
Mr. Rutherford, I remind
you that the deaths

26:00.809 --> 26:02.732
of Mr. Greenwood and Mrs. McAllister

26:03.020 --> 26:04.220
are still under investigation.

26:04.271 --> 26:05.193
Mrs. McAllister'?

26:05.481 --> 26:06.761
The woman died of a heart attack.

26:06.899 --> 26:09.277
Hail to see what you could
possibly need to investigate.

26:09.568 --> 26:11.115
- Leave that to me.
- Happily.

26:11.403 --> 26:14.122
And you leave the running
of tonight's show to me.

26:14.406 --> 26:15.407
So it's a show now?

26:15.699 --> 26:16.666
Certainly.

26:16.950 --> 26:18.327
New lighting, new decor-

26:18.619 --> 26:21.919
Mr. Barnum will be turning
in his grave with envy,

26:22.206 --> 26:24.504
because unlike him, I deliver.

26:24.792 --> 26:25.714
Deliver what?

26:26.001 --> 26:27.469
The curse, of course,

26:27.753 --> 26:28.675
in action.

26:28.962 --> 26:30.305
Desmond, don't be such a fool.

26:30.589 --> 26:32.466
Iris, stay out of this.

26:32.758 --> 26:34.886
These are the affairs of men.

26:35.177 --> 26:38.351
You mean it takes a man to
turn a 5,000-year-old culture

26:38.639 --> 26:40.186
into a traveling circus.

26:41.350 --> 26:42.146
Precisely.

26:44.770 --> 26:46.363
Doctor!

26:52.152 --> 26:53.870
Anubis.

26:55.656 --> 26:58.409
Forgive us, please.

27:02.538 --> 27:05.166
Pity that didn't happen during the show.

27:16.718 --> 27:17.890
He's here.

27:18.178 --> 27:19.270
- He's here?
- Yes.

27:22.474 --> 27:24.067
- What is going on?
- Oh, we just want an autograph.

27:24.351 --> 27:25.694
Oh, there he is!

27:25.978 --> 27:28.481
Higgins, what on Earth is going on here'?

27:28.772 --> 27:29.771
What do they want?

27:29.773 --> 27:30.945
- You.
- Me?

27:31.233 --> 27:32.655
It seems your book and this supposed curse

27:32.943 --> 27:34.911
have turned you into a
bit of a celebrity, George.

27:36.155 --> 27:37.998
I don't know what to do.

27:38.282 --> 27:40.501
I'd make a break for it if I were you.

27:42.661 --> 27:45.710
Murdoch, I hear you had
a brush with the curse.

27:45.998 --> 27:47.841
I'm perfectly fine, sir.

27:51.795 --> 27:53.342
George, are you quite all right?

27:53.630 --> 27:55.678
You look rather persecuted.

27:57.384 --> 27:59.057
Price of fame, sir.

28:01.513 --> 28:03.732
Sir, I've narrowed our list of suspects.

28:04.016 --> 28:04.983
Now, this is a list of the events

28:05.267 --> 28:06.393
relating to the curse,

28:06.685 --> 28:08.358
and this is a list of the people

28:08.645 --> 28:10.085
who were present during those events.

28:10.189 --> 28:12.066
Now, Dr. Bajjali can be excluded

28:12.357 --> 28:13.859
because she was the intended victim

28:14.151 --> 28:15.198
of the most recent attack.

28:15.485 --> 28:17.112
Or you were and she planned it.

28:17.404 --> 28:19.998
I find that highly unlikely, sir.

28:20.282 --> 28:21.762
I see you've ruled out the Egyptian.

28:21.825 --> 28:23.247
Yes, sir.

28:23.535 --> 28:26.288
Mr. Sharif seems as though
he had the strongest motive,

28:26.580 --> 28:28.381
but he doesn't appear
to have had opportunity.

28:28.415 --> 28:29.837
So Rutherford it is.

28:30.125 --> 28:32.002
He appears to be our
strongest suspect, yes.

28:32.294 --> 28:33.415
Right, let's bring him in.

28:33.545 --> 28:37.266
Sir, I would prefer to
leave him to his own devices.

28:37.549 --> 28:39.096
You want to catch him in the act.

28:39.384 --> 28:40.985
Bit of a dangerous game, don't you think?

28:41.136 --> 28:42.178
Yes, it is, sir,

28:42.179 --> 28:43.459
but I don't yet have the evidence

28:43.472 --> 28:44.439
to support his guilt.

28:44.723 --> 28:45.722
Right, then.

28:45.724 --> 28:47.101
Crabtree, put a man on him.

28:47.392 --> 28:49.440
- Sir.
- Oh, and, Crabtree?

28:49.728 --> 28:51.648
You'd better find somewhere
other than my station

28:51.897 --> 28:53.820
for your gaggle of admirers to run riot.

28:56.068 --> 28:57.320
Yes, sir.

28:57.611 --> 29:00.114
Price of fame.

29:12.626 --> 29:15.379
Oh, I imagine she's here to see you.

29:15.671 --> 29:16.968
Dr. Bajjali?

29:17.256 --> 29:19.179
I've asked for her expert consultation.

29:19.466 --> 29:21.466
Look, Murdoch, I don't
like dragging up the past,

29:21.593 --> 29:23.061
but it does bear reminding.

29:23.345 --> 29:24.847
You aren't always the most circumspect

29:25.138 --> 29:26.699
when an attractive and intelligent woman

29:26.848 --> 29:28.316
is involved.

29:28.600 --> 29:29.943
I'll keep that in mind.

29:30.227 --> 29:31.695
Mm.

29:31.979 --> 29:33.276
<i>Ah, ma'am.</i>

29:33.563 --> 29:35.315
Doctor, how good of you to come.

29:35.607 --> 29:37.154
Detective.

29:40.237 --> 29:41.358
So you're no further along

29:41.571 --> 29:42.948
in identifying the mummy princess.

29:43.240 --> 29:44.617
<i>No.</i>

29:44.908 --> 29:47.957
If wasn't unusual for royalty
to be erased from history.

29:48.245 --> 29:49.963
But even so, I've never seen anyone

29:50.247 --> 29:52.545
quite so thoroughly expunged as this.

29:54.501 --> 29:56.221
This is a passage from
the Book of the Dead.

29:56.336 --> 29:58.134
The funerary text of ancient Egypt.

29:58.422 --> 30:01.551
Indeed, although the name is misleading.

30:01.842 --> 30:04.345
Because it's not an actual book at all

30:04.636 --> 30:06.889
but a series of spells and incantations

30:07.180 --> 30:09.524
meant to guide the dead to the underworld.

30:09.808 --> 30:12.277
Your knowledge of Egypt
never ceases to amaze me.

30:15.939 --> 30:18.362
You're absolutely certain
that the sarcophagus

30:18.650 --> 30:20.823
had never been previously opened,

30:21.111 --> 30:23.864
and I've failed to find an
entry point for the cobra.

30:24.156 --> 30:26.784
If there had been an
opening, I would have seen it.

30:27.075 --> 30:30.329
Although that is not this
coffin's only mystery.

30:30.620 --> 30:32.543
- No?
- Here.

30:32.831 --> 30:35.675
The gold leaf appears
to have a gypsum base,

30:35.959 --> 30:38.257
which is characteristic
of a period much older

30:38.545 --> 30:40.343
than the rest of the decoration suggests.

30:40.630 --> 30:42.849
Gypsum...

30:43.133 --> 30:44.476
I have an idea.

30:46.386 --> 30:47.478
What is that?

30:47.763 --> 30:50.858
Something that may help solve your mystery.

30:51.141 --> 30:53.143
Gypsum is calcium sulfate.

30:53.435 --> 30:55.984
It ï¬‚uoresces under ultraviolet light.

31:03.945 --> 31:05.367
It can't be.

31:05.655 --> 31:09.831
"Here lies the body of Queen Maat.â€œ."

31:10.118 --> 31:11.370
My God.

31:13.455 --> 31:15.958
She really did exist.

31:16.249 --> 31:18.217
And so must her curse.

31:18.502 --> 31:19.543
How do you mean?

31:19.544 --> 31:20.716
I didn't want to let myself believe,

31:21.004 --> 31:22.381
but everything fits,

31:22.672 --> 31:23.844
even our near miss...

31:24.132 --> 31:26.555
the revenge of Anubis.

31:26.843 --> 31:29.596
There are only two stages left.

31:29.888 --> 31:33.768
The next is the consumption of Ra's power'

31:34.059 --> 31:36.528
I must get back to the exhibit.

31:36.812 --> 31:38.485
Are you sure that's wise, Doctor'?

31:38.772 --> 31:40.093
Would you stop working on a case

31:40.357 --> 31:42.325
because your life was threatened?

32:09.928 --> 32:12.351
Curse, eh?

32:17.936 --> 32:20.485
Gently, please.

32:21.940 --> 32:23.112
Thank you.

32:23.400 --> 32:24.868
Mr. Rutherford.

32:25.152 --> 32:27.496
Ah, Detective. So glad you could make it.

32:27.779 --> 32:31.409
Tonight's event will be
one for the history books.

32:31.700 --> 32:33.998
I'll need you to accompany
me to the station house.

32:34.286 --> 32:37.540
I'm afraid I'm otherwise
occupied at the moment.

32:37.831 --> 32:39.871
You are the prime suspect
in two suspicious deaths

32:40.125 --> 32:41.377
and an attempted murder.

32:41.668 --> 32:43.988
If you wish to clear your name,
I suggest you come with me.

32:44.171 --> 32:45.764
Detective, you really are loo much.

32:46.047 --> 32:47.094
If you had any evidence,

32:47.382 --> 32:48.929
you would have arrested me already.

32:49.217 --> 32:50.810
You had the means and the opportunity

32:51.094 --> 32:52.687
to create this curse

32:52.971 --> 32:54.689
and whip the city into near hysteria.

32:54.973 --> 32:57.601
What's more, you are profiting
from the tragic death of others.

32:57.893 --> 32:59.454
Detective Murdoch, lam not a murderer.

32:59.728 --> 33:02.356
I have done nothing more
than seize an opportunity.

33:02.647 --> 33:04.866
Uxbridge, see to the detective.

33:05.150 --> 33:08.825
Make sure he has a good spot
to watch the proceedings.

33:09.112 --> 33:10.910
Enjoy the show.

33:14.493 --> 33:17.292
<i>. Guard.</i>

33:17.579 --> 33:19.126
Are you quite all right, sir?

33:19.414 --> 33:21.587
Shut it down.

33:21.875 --> 33:22.876
<i>I'm sorry?</i>

33:23.168 --> 33:24.090
The exhibit-

33:24.377 --> 33:26.345
you said you would shut it down.

33:26.630 --> 33:27.472
The curse...

33:27.756 --> 33:29.008
You know who's responsible?

33:29.299 --> 33:31.051
Queen Maat, of course.

33:31.343 --> 33:34.267
Don't you trust your own eyes?

33:45.857 --> 33:47.154
Sir.

33:47.442 --> 33:49.615
I just got a report
from Constable Armstrong,

33:49.903 --> 33:51.371
who was watching Mr.' Sharif.

33:51.655 --> 33:52.747
Armstrong, George?

33:53.031 --> 33:54.829
Sir, he believes he heard Mr. Sharif

33:55.116 --> 33:56.584
have a conversation that he thought

33:56.868 --> 33:58.370
to be conspiratorial in nature

33:58.662 --> 33:59.707
and in a foreign tongue.

33:59.708 --> 34:01.001
Are you quite sure, George?

34:01.289 --> 34:03.417
Armstrong hears conspiracies
around every corner.

34:03.708 --> 34:05.210
I know, sir, He's quite convinced.

34:05.502 --> 34:07.675
And who did he say Mr.
Sharif was speaking to?

34:07.963 --> 34:09.003
That lady archaeologist,

34:09.214 --> 34:11.467
Dr. Bajjali.

34:11.757 --> 34:13.385
Iris?

34:20.308 --> 34:22.356
Queen Maat,

34:22.643 --> 34:24.942
worshiper of justice,

34:25.230 --> 34:28.985
earthly vessel of the laws of the gods,

34:29.275 --> 34:31.277
stripped of her dignity,

34:31.570 --> 34:36.326
her place in history washed
away by the sands of time,

34:36.616 --> 34:41.087
a woman forced to face judgment...

34:41.371 --> 34:44.841
- Sharif.
- Hated for her strength...

34:45.125 --> 34:46.672
- It's her.
- And supreme power.

34:46.960 --> 34:48.757
I prayed it wasn't.

34:49.045 --> 34:50.297
<i>I'm sorry?</i>

34:50.589 --> 34:51.590
Iris-

34:51.880 --> 34:53.257
she's of royal blood,

34:53.550 --> 34:55.518
descended from the pharaohs.

34:55.802 --> 34:59.102
She's their earthly vessel of revenge.

35:00.307 --> 35:02.651
Ladies and gentlemen,

35:02.934 --> 35:06.063
no longer the Unknown Princess-

35:06.354 --> 35:08.277
I present to you

35:08.565 --> 35:11.068
the legendary, cursed...

35:11.359 --> 35:14.613
Queen Maat.

35:36.301 --> 35:38.178
The body is with Dr. Grace, sir.

35:38.470 --> 35:39.312
Very good, George.

35:39.596 --> 35:40.876
And we apprehended Mr. Sharif.

35:40.972 --> 35:42.019
He was at Union Station.

35:42.307 --> 35:43.707
We're bringing him into custody now.

35:43.892 --> 35:45.235
Excellent.

35:45.518 --> 35:47.646
Once she's changed,
please escort Dr. Bajjali

35:47.937 --> 35:48.859
to the station house.

35:49.147 --> 35:50.569
Sir.

36:05.830 --> 36:07.707
Seems your chart was wrong.

36:07.999 --> 36:10.718
I hadn't counted on a partnership, sir.

36:11.002 --> 36:15.052
Maybe you should take him,
and I'll deal with the lady.

36:15.340 --> 36:17.684
Sir, perhaps your style of questioning

36:17.967 --> 36:20.345
would be better suited to the male suspect.

36:20.637 --> 36:22.435
Perhaps.

36:22.722 --> 36:24.190
Oh, but, Murdoch, one thing.

36:24.474 --> 36:25.473
<i>Yes'?</i>

36:25.475 --> 36:27.443
She may be a murderer.

36:27.727 --> 36:28.979
Remember that.

36:47.163 --> 36:49.131
Let's not waste any more time, shall we?

36:49.416 --> 36:51.257
I know you and the girl
were in on it together.

36:51.418 --> 36:52.590
What girl?

36:52.877 --> 36:53.878
In on what'?

36:54.170 --> 36:55.888
You and Mr. Sharif are acquainted,

36:56.172 --> 36:57.890
are you not, Dr. Bajjali?

36:59.217 --> 37:01.470
Dr. Bajjali?

37:01.761 --> 37:03.763
Please answer the question.

37:04.055 --> 37:05.898
Yes, you know we are.

37:07.392 --> 37:09.235
Perhaps I'm not making myself clear.

37:09.519 --> 37:11.817
You and Mr. Sharif are well-acquainted.

37:12.105 --> 37:13.482
I have no idea what you're talking about.

37:13.773 --> 37:15.025
Oh, I think you do.

37:15.316 --> 37:17.569
You've been wanting to
shutdown this exhibit all along.

37:17.861 --> 37:19.989
Yes, but not like this.

37:20.280 --> 37:21.881
I cannot explain what has been happening.

37:22.031 --> 37:23.471
You mean how the only two Egyptians

37:23.575 --> 37:24.792
associated with the exhibit

37:25.076 --> 37:27.795
managed lo dodge this supposed curse?

37:28.079 --> 37:31.299
- Because we are both Egyptians, we must be co
- Conspirators.

37:31.583 --> 37:33.176
Is that it'?

37:33.460 --> 37:34.507
Really, William.

37:34.508 --> 37:36.220
It's Detective Murdoch.

37:36.504 --> 37:37.972
Is it?

37:38.256 --> 37:39.348
I think I'll be going.

37:39.632 --> 37:40.929
Not until you explain why the two of you

37:41.217 --> 37:42.969
were seen clandestinely meeting.

37:43.261 --> 37:44.260
That's ridiculous.

37:44.262 --> 37:45.514
Is it?

37:45.805 --> 37:46.852
You have no proof.

37:47.140 --> 37:48.580
You were always around the exhibit.

37:48.641 --> 37:50.018
Of course; How could I protest against it

37:50.310 --> 37:51.402
if I wasn't there?

37:51.686 --> 37:53.086
You mean how could you sabotage it

37:53.104 --> 37:54.103
if you wasn't there?

37:54.105 --> 37:55.072
Sabotage?

37:55.356 --> 37:56.357
How'?

37:56.649 --> 37:58.651
I had no access to any of the artifacts.

37:58.943 --> 38:00.945
Not you, perhaps,

38:01.237 --> 38:04.787
but a well-placed partner in
the expeditionary team would.

38:05.074 --> 38:07.702
I believed Mr., Sharif to be guilty.

38:07.994 --> 38:12.170
I sought to gain his trust
and approached him as a friend.

38:12.457 --> 38:13.937
The two of you we're speaking Arabic,

38:14.209 --> 38:15.552
so no one can confirm this.

38:17.295 --> 38:19.093
Mr. Sharif can.

38:19.380 --> 38:22.008
An unsatisfactory corroboration.

38:23.843 --> 38:26.722
Do you really believe that I would be party

38:27.013 --> 38:31.689
to the ruination of everything
We have worked so hard for'?

38:32.852 --> 38:35.651
With Mr. Greenwood and Mr. Rutherford dead,

38:35.939 --> 38:37.657
you would be able to take over the exhibit.

38:37.941 --> 38:39.262
You would like that, wouldn't you?

38:39.400 --> 38:43.450
Yes, but only to present
it with dignity, respect.

38:43.738 --> 38:45.661
You had access to the sarcophagus.

38:45.949 --> 38:48.668
You demonstrated an ability
to handle a deadly cobra.

38:48.952 --> 38:51.671
You knew well enough to
tamper with electrical wires.

38:51.955 --> 38:53.673
You were present at every death.

38:53.957 --> 38:56.710
You used the curse to cover your tracks.

38:57.001 --> 39:00.847
How dare you accuse me?

39:02.590 --> 39:04.217
And what of the attempt on my life?

39:04.509 --> 39:06.807
I believe that was meant for me.

39:08.263 --> 39:09.640
Ridiculous.

39:09.931 --> 39:11.979
You weren't part of the expedition.

39:12.267 --> 39:13.644
How could you be part of the curse?

39:13.935 --> 39:15.653
Detective, I-

39:21.818 --> 39:23.338
- Dr. Grace. It is highly inappropriate

39:23.486 --> 39:24.487
for you to interrupt me

39:24.779 --> 39:26.281
in the middle of an interrogation.

39:26.573 --> 39:27.950
I must insist you learn to knock.

39:28.241 --> 39:29.921
Quite right, but this simply cannot wait.

39:29.993 --> 39:31.034
I had a thought.

39:31.035 --> 39:32.207
I'm sure we can discuss your thought

39:32.495 --> 39:33.535
at a more suitable moment.

39:33.663 --> 39:34.705
Of course.

39:34.706 --> 39:36.504
But it struck me that
although we discovered

39:36.791 --> 39:38.259
that the snake had eaten the gerbil,

39:38.543 --> 39:40.841
we neglected to find out
what the gerbil had eaten.

39:41.129 --> 39:43.257
- Which undoubtedly you know'?
- Indeed.

39:43.548 --> 39:46.722
A paste made from a
herbal remedy for fevers,

39:47.010 --> 39:48.728
Egyptian chamomile.

40:07.405 --> 40:09.874
I trust that was worth the interruption?

40:11.367 --> 40:13.415
Irving, please tell the inspector

40:13.703 --> 40:16.832
that Mr. Sharif is free to go.

40:17.123 --> 40:19.922
Thank you, Doctor. That
was very helpful indeed.

40:31.679 --> 40:34.102
It's time to pack up the exhibit.

40:35.516 --> 40:37.189
That's hardly your decision.

40:38.770 --> 40:40.568
Trust me, Iris.

40:53.409 --> 40:55.753
Phillip, you really must see a doctor.

40:56.037 --> 40:58.916
Every time I see you,
you look worse and worse.

40:59.207 --> 41:01.175
You're sending everything back.

41:01.459 --> 41:02.927
The curse will be broken.

41:03.211 --> 41:04.371
What are you talking about?

41:04.587 --> 41:06.027
The exhibit will now move to Chicago.

41:06.047 --> 41:07.046
You know that.

41:07.048 --> 41:08.470
You can'! Do that.

41:08.758 --> 41:10.135
Phillip, you have a fever.

41:10.426 --> 41:11.586
You're not thinking straight.

41:11.803 --> 41:13.271
If she doesn't go away,

41:13.554 --> 41:15.181
the killing will continue.

41:15.473 --> 41:17.567
Phillip, there is no curse.

41:17.850 --> 41:19.898
Can't you see what's happening around you?

41:20.186 --> 41:21.654
I refuse to believe that a children's story

41:21.938 --> 41:23.315
is going to kill me.

41:23.606 --> 41:25.447
That's what Burrows
said just before he died.

41:25.608 --> 41:29.112
And then I got sick,
and I haven't got better.

41:29.404 --> 41:31.452
The only way that we can break the curse

41:31.739 --> 41:33.537
is to send everything back to Egypt.

41:33.825 --> 41:35.418
Please.

41:35.702 --> 41:37.921
I don'! Want you to be next.

41:38.204 --> 41:41.424
The exhibit will go on as planned.

41:41.708 --> 41:44.257
I can't let you do that.

41:47.505 --> 41:49.007
Uxbridge!

41:49.298 --> 41:51.221
Iris, are you all right'?

41:53.302 --> 41:54.301
Why did you do it?

41:54.303 --> 41:55.270
It wasn't me.

41:55.555 --> 41:57.023
It was Queen Maat.

41:57.306 --> 42:00.059
It was you that put the
snake in the sarcophagus.

42:00.351 --> 42:01.568
I found the compartment.

42:01.853 --> 42:03.776
It was you that tipped
the frieze of Anubis.

42:04.063 --> 42:05.565
Only it wasn't meant for me, was it?

42:05.857 --> 42:08.326
Killing a police officer
wouldn't prove the curse.

42:08.609 --> 42:10.737
You weren't supposed to be there.

42:11.029 --> 42:12.622
It was you that frayed
the wires to the switch.

42:12.905 --> 42:15.249
You knew Rutherford would want
to light the stage himself.

42:15.533 --> 42:18.161
He had to be stopped.

42:18.453 --> 42:19.733
If you would have listened to me,

42:19.871 --> 42:22.090
no one would have got killed.

42:22.373 --> 42:24.250
And Mrs. McAllister?

42:24.542 --> 42:26.089
That wasn't me.

42:26.377 --> 42:29.096
How did you induce her heart attack, hmm?

42:29.380 --> 42:30.882
I didn't kill her, I swear.

42:31.174 --> 42:32.426
How did you do-

42:32.717 --> 42:33.639
<i>Stop.</i>

42:33.926 --> 42:34.927
Stop!

42:36.095 --> 42:37.642
Stop!

42:38.931 --> 42:39.807
The fire wagon!

42:40.099 --> 42:41.180
- Out of the way!
- Phillip!

43:13.257 --> 43:16.010
Why the long face, eh?

43:16.302 --> 43:17.428
Another case is solved.

43:17.720 --> 43:19.097
There are no more rotting corpses

43:19.388 --> 43:20.685
hanging around my station house.

43:20.973 --> 43:22.691
In fact, it's a good day, young Crabtree.

43:22.975 --> 43:24.943
So why don't you take the rest of it off

43:25.228 --> 43:27.777
and go attend to your adoring public?

43:28.064 --> 43:30.738
Sir, it seems my book is not
quite as popular as it once was.

43:31.025 --> 43:32.993
<i>Fame is a fickle mistress.</i>

43:33.277 --> 43:35.120
Yes, sir.

43:37.490 --> 43:38.992
Crabtree,

43:39.283 --> 43:40.910
my wife has been nagging me

43:41.202 --> 43:42.624
for that signed copy of your book.

43:42.912 --> 43:44.129
Driving me crackers, she is.

43:44.413 --> 43:46.256
Oh, happy to oblige, sir.

43:46.541 --> 43:48.543
Anything for the missus.

43:48.835 --> 43:50.196
Sir, I imagine you'll be interested

43:50.253 --> 43:52.631
in the idea I have for my next book:

43:52.922 --> 43:54.265
Leprechauns'

43:54.549 --> 43:56.222
Now, what people don't
realize, sir, is, leprechauns

43:56.509 --> 43:59.353
are actually nasty little
beasts with very sharp teeth.

43:59.637 --> 44:01.639
And their gold, if it's even real gold,

44:01.931 --> 44:03.252
is hidden at the end of a rainbow,

44:03.474 --> 44:05.275
and only a handful of
people have ever even...

44:07.228 --> 44:08.480
Detective, I-

44:13.860 --> 44:15.328
Dr. Grace.

44:15.611 --> 44:17.659
I've concluded my
examination of Mr. Uxbridge.

44:17.947 --> 44:18.987
It was quite illuminating.

44:19.240 --> 44:20.366
Oh, how so?

44:20.658 --> 44:23.002
He died due to injuries
caused by the firetruck.

44:23.286 --> 44:25.288
And you found that to be illuminating?

44:25.580 --> 44:27.048
Not at all.

44:27.331 --> 44:31.131
Rather that otherwise he seemed
to have been in perfect health.

44:31.419 --> 44:32.420
Are you quite sure?

44:32.712 --> 44:33.838
He looked to be on the brink of death.

44:34.130 --> 44:35.473
I discovered that the chamomile

44:35.756 --> 44:38.054
he was constantly eating
was laced with mandrake.

44:38.342 --> 44:40.060
Mandrake, the poison?

44:40.344 --> 44:43.598
Yes, but the dosage he was
exposed to wasn't fatal.

44:43.890 --> 44:45.370
The plants were likely grown together.

44:45.474 --> 44:46.942
Ifs not uncommon.

44:47.226 --> 44:49.467
- Could the mandrake have caused the fever
- Like symptoms?

44:49.604 --> 44:50.651
<i>No.</i>

44:50.938 --> 44:53.987
But it would have caused
rather vivid hallucinations.

44:54.275 --> 44:56.573
He probably saw the curse, so to speak.

44:56.861 --> 44:58.033
Fascinating.

44:58.321 --> 45:00.164
He believed in his ailment so strongly,

45:00.448 --> 45:01.688
he willed it to manifest itself.

45:01.741 --> 45:02.833
Indeed.

45:03.117 --> 45:05.119
Truly mind over matter, as they say.

45:05.411 --> 45:07.379
Mm, and Mrs. McAllister'?

45:07.663 --> 45:10.257
- It really was just a heart attack
-

45:10.541 --> 45:12.339
the coincidence that proves the rule.

45:16.839 --> 45:18.762
Dr. Grace?

45:19.050 --> 45:19.972
Good work.

45:20.259 --> 45:21.511
Thank you.

45:27.725 --> 45:31.150
So off to Chicago, then,
to re-stage the exhibit?

45:31.437 --> 45:33.986
Actually. I've found it
a permanent home there,

45:34.273 --> 45:35.445
no more circus act,

45:35.733 --> 45:39.237
just a nice quiet museum.

45:39.528 --> 45:41.329
And will you be making
a home there as well?

45:41.614 --> 45:45.209
Oh, no, I'm not the homemaking type.

45:45.493 --> 45:47.871
But ii all goes according to plan,

45:48.162 --> 45:50.631
I will be back among pyramids very soon,

45:50.915 --> 45:53.464
only this time in the Mexican rain forest-

45:53.751 --> 45:54.593
Chichén ltzé.

45:54.877 --> 45:57.426
Mayan ruins, how wonderful.

45:57.713 --> 45:59.932
You would like it, I think.

46:00.216 --> 46:02.469
The thrill of discovery is the same

46:02.760 --> 46:05.388
regardless of what it is one discovers.

46:08.641 --> 46:11.235
Do you remember the
last stage of the curse?

46:13.437 --> 46:16.486
Ra will send his chariot of fire.

46:16.774 --> 46:18.401
Or his fire wagon?

46:20.278 --> 46:23.498
Perhaps science can't
explain everything after all.

46:26.450 --> 46:27.827
Good-bye, William.

46:28.119 --> 46:29.371
Good-bye, Iris.

46:33.582 --> 46:35.209
Hyup! Hyup!

46:36.305 --> 46:42.525
