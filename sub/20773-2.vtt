- Hey.

But he knows something.

about his role

were both very fine examples

that this country produces.

Nelson and Nate Baldwin.

the treasure's buried.

the state cops about Clay,

07:13.840 --> 07:15.119
tell them what I saw.

07:15.120 --> 07:16.999

your chief investigator

07:17.000 --> 07:19.199

with other agencies.

Clay's death are available.

07:23.920 --> 07:25.639
Hey! That's Nate Baldwin's WAG.

07:25.640 --> 07:27.360
She has an online betting account.

07:28.800 --> 07:32.279
Lucy Brooks is his WAG. Well,
wife, not 'and girlfriend'.

07:32.280 --> 07:34.199
- Lucy Brooks?
- Baldwin nee Brooks.

07:34.200 --> 07:37.320
She was at that charity
auction thing, too.

07:40.640 --> 07:42.999
Maybe she paid for that
dress via illegal betting.

08:14.560 --> 08:15.839
I couldn't possibly say.

08:15.840 --> 08:17.879
So... suicide?

08:17.880 --> 08:19.839
I'm sure Clay saw that bus coming.

08:19.840 --> 08:22.759
- Other witnesses say he didn't.
- I saw him see it.

08:22.760 --> 08:24.839
A couple of passengers also stated

08:24.840 --> 08:26.919
the driver was distracted,
wasn't watching the road.

08:26.920 --> 08:29.679
Well, you've been to Clay's house.
Was there anything there? A note?

08:29.680 --> 08:32.438
I think I would have noticed
a suicide note, Janet.

08:32.440 --> 08:34.399
His son had been with him
on an overnight stay,

08:34.400 --> 08:37.078
reckoned him and his
father had a normal night.

08:37.080 --> 08:38.839
Played video games together.

08:38.840 --> 08:41.399
Clay dropped him at school the
next day, kissed him goodbye.

08:41.400 --> 08:43.080
Everything as normal.

08:45.080 --> 08:47.960
There was this, on a coffee
table in the lounge.

08:52.040 --> 08:54.319
Oxycodone. That's like
morphine, isn't it?

08:54.320 --> 08:55.919
It's dangerous stuff
to leave lying around,

08:55.920 --> 08:57.239
especially if you've got a kid.

08:57.240 --> 08:58.919
No patient or prescriber name.

08:58.920 --> 09:00.479
His doctor didn't prescribe it.

09:00.480 --> 09:03.879
His son and ex-wife both reckon
they've never seen them before.

09:03.880 --> 09:05.679
Maybe Clay had a secret opiate habit.

09:05.680 --> 09:07.679
The autopsy would show
if he was a user or not.

09:07.680 --> 09:09.719
The pack was unopened. Seal intact.

09:09.720 --> 09:12.239
Richard heard someone come
to Clay's last night.

09:12.240 --> 09:14.039
Whoever that was, maybe they left it.

09:14.040 --> 09:16.599
We'll trace the batch number,
find out where it came from.

09:16.600 --> 09:18.440
- We'll check it out.
- Thanks.

09:32.720 --> 09:34.559
- There you go.
- Thank you.

09:34.560 --> 09:36.200
- Need this.

09:37.360 --> 09:39.599
I think they're finally asleep.

09:39.600 --> 09:41.120
(CHUCKLES)

09:43.200 --> 09:45.399
I keep thinking about the
night I had to tell the twins

09:45.400 --> 09:47.120
Ash wasn't coming home.

09:50.080 --> 09:53.120
They were two, and hadn't been
without her for more than a day.

09:56.200 --> 09:58.720
I had to try to explain
what 'never' meant.

10:02.120 --> 10:04.199
"Mummy's never coming home."

10:04.200 --> 10:06.199
I could barely say it myself.

10:06.200 --> 10:08.160
Anyway, they didn't understand it, so...

10:09.480 --> 10:12.120
over the next few months,
they just kept on asking...

10:13.880 --> 10:15.640
"Where is Mummy?"

10:21.240 --> 10:23.360
"In heaven," I used to say.

10:27.560 --> 10:30.399
And so, for at least a year,
every time we went for a drive,

10:30.400 --> 10:33.640
Emma would say, "Are
we going to heaven?"

10:40.240 --> 10:43.200
I don't think a child ever gets
over the loss of a parent.

10:44.640 --> 10:46.999
Liam and Emma, and...

10:47.000 --> 10:49.160
Clay's son, Reed.

10:53.360 --> 10:56.040
Do you remember that we only
just saw them in Melbourne?

10:57.280 --> 10:59.079
And they looked so happy.

10:59.080 --> 11:00.400
EMMA: Mummy.

11:02.080 --> 11:04.439
Mummy, I can't sleep again.

11:04.440 --> 11:06.159
Come here, sweetheart.

11:06.160 --> 11:08.360
You give Mum a hug. It's all right.

11:10.800 --> 11:12.520
It's all right. Shh.

11:21.640 --> 11:23.680
I'm here. You're okay.

11:26.680 --> 11:28.160
Shh.

11:49.280 --> 11:51.280
So, how long's this gonna take?

11:53.240 --> 11:54.800
As long as it takes.

12:01.520 --> 12:04.639
So, you were responsible for
Clay Nelson's contracts,

12:04.640 --> 12:06.319
his sponsorships.

12:06.320 --> 12:08.080
You do know he just died?

12:09.080 --> 12:10.639
We've expressed our sympathies.

12:10.640 --> 12:12.480
Answer the question, please.

12:13.680 --> 12:15.399
I looked after his career, yes.

12:15.400 --> 12:18.319
Australian Tax Office records
show that last financial year

12:18.320 --> 12:21.760
his income from all sources
was $710,000.

12:23.560 --> 12:24.600
Sounds right.

12:24.662 --> 12:25.720
And in that same year,

12:25.721 --> 12:29.479
he bought a yacht, a Sidney Nolan,
a house, outright, no debt,

12:29.480 --> 12:31.520
on 710,000?

12:33.120 --> 12:34.719
What was his other source of income?

12:34.720 --> 12:36.399
My God. Clay's a wonderful cricketer.

12:36.426 --> 12:39.908
He's one of our greatest.
He's loved all over the world.

12:39.994 --> 12:40.999
There's talk of a state
funeral. Did you know...

12:41.000 --> 12:42.200
TONY: Your client, Ms Reynolds,

12:42.201 --> 12:44.559
may have been the best
batsman since Tendulkar,

12:44.560 --> 12:46.879
but he was obviously not
declaring all his income.

12:46.880 --> 12:48.519
Lucky at the casino, my guess.

12:48.520 --> 12:51.239
Another of your clients has
been lucky recently, too.

12:51.240 --> 12:53.999
Nate Baldwin, got off a really
serious assault charge...

12:54.000 --> 12:55.439
I thought this was about Clay.

12:55.440 --> 12:56.999
And now his team, the Northern Devils,

12:57.000 --> 12:59.039
who were tipped to finish
bottom of the ladder last year,

12:59.040 --> 13:01.720
have defied expectation
quite considerably.

13:02.880 --> 13:04.400
Very good season.

13:08.440 --> 13:11.839
When the odds of the Devils
making the semis was 1,000 to 1,

13:11.840 --> 13:15.079
a number of large online
bets were placed on them.

13:15.080 --> 13:17.399
If the Devils made the semis, those
punters would make millions.

13:17.400 --> 13:19.439
And lo and behold, Nate and
the boys defy the odds,

13:19.440 --> 13:20.919
cellar dwellers to number four.

13:20.920 --> 13:24.239
The Northern Devils have won several
matches we suspect were fixed.

13:24.240 --> 13:26.599
Nate is a wonderful role model.

13:26.600 --> 13:28.999
He does charity work, clinics with kids.

13:29.000 --> 13:31.600
Nate Baldwin's regularly
photographed with this man.

13:35.000 --> 13:37.399
Darren Faulkes? He's a fan.

13:37.400 --> 13:40.440
Mr Faulkes is known to be
linked to organised crime.

13:41.920 --> 13:43.959
Strange choice of companion
for a role model.

13:43.960 --> 13:45.759
Look, I don't understand you people.

13:45.760 --> 13:48.399
I mean, my clients, Nate and
Clay, they are fine young men...

13:48.400 --> 13:52.399
Who are both associated with suspect
sport betting and match fixing.

13:52.400 --> 13:54.799
You're either a very bad
manager or a very good one.

13:54.800 --> 13:56.359
But I already told you,

13:56.360 --> 14:00.319
I don't know anything about match
fixing or illegal gambling.

14:00.320 --> 14:02.079
But you know who might?

14:02.080 --> 14:05.039
The Devils' major
sponsor, Pax Car Rentals.

14:05.040 --> 14:08.239
Plus, it wouldn't surprise me if
the company's got money troubles,

14:08.240 --> 14:10.719
because the team's under
pressure, huge pressure,

14:10.720 --> 14:13.000
to finish even better
than fourth this season.

14:28.280 --> 14:30.879
MAN 1: You gotta deliver,
boys. Earn your keep.

14:30.880 --> 14:33.999
This isn't preschool, it's the big time.

14:34.000 --> 14:38.479
MAN 2: What Yanni's saying is, last
season we got close, all right.

14:38.480 --> 14:41.359
This time we want to go all
the way. History happens now.

14:41.360 --> 14:44.239
So, chop chop. Holiday's over. Let's go.

14:44.240 --> 14:45.360
Oi, coach.

14:45.361 --> 14:47.199
Am I gonna get a start in first grade?

14:47.200 --> 14:48.919
It's day one of preseason, Ty.

14:48.920 --> 14:50.999
For round one, yeah? I'll get a start?

14:51.000 --> 14:52.919
You'll need your mouthguard first, okay?

14:52.920 --> 14:54.239
Okay.

14:54.240 --> 14:56.079
Nate!

14:56.080 --> 14:58.000
Wakey wakey, hand off snakey!

14:59.680 --> 15:02.479
All right, we're gonna
go back to the three Fs,

15:02.480 --> 15:04.359
fitness, fitness and fitness.

15:04.360 --> 15:07.079
TYLER: Are you serious?
Are you fucking serious?!

15:07.080 --> 15:09.039
- What's your problem?
- That's my fucking sister!

15:09.040 --> 15:10.879
Go give those blokes a
boot up the bum, would ya?

15:10.880 --> 15:12.439
- That's my fucking sister!
- Oi!

15:12.440 --> 15:13.679
- Fuck, mate.
- Oi!

15:13.680 --> 15:15.559
Fuck off!

15:15.560 --> 15:17.399
(INDISTINCT SHOUTING)

15:17.400 --> 15:19.000
Fuck off, Nate!

15:21.560 --> 15:23.000
(THUD)

15:25.040 --> 15:26.520
Shit.

15:28.720 --> 15:29.999
Ty?

15:30.000 --> 15:31.160
Ty!

15:31.161 --> 15:34.199
Jesus Christ. Rhys, call an ambulance.

15:34.200 --> 15:35.720
Come on, mate. Ty?

15:37.880 --> 15:39.719
Ty, come on.

15:39.720 --> 15:42.039
- Have you charged him?
- Detained for questioning.

15:42.040 --> 15:44.120
Which we haven't begun,
because he wanted his lawyer.

15:46.840 --> 15:48.360
Couple of minutes?

15:50.000 --> 15:52.239
He's dead, Stirlo. Tyler's bloody
dead. He died in the ambulance.

15:52.240 --> 15:54.199
- He didn't make it to the hospital...
- Why don't you sit down?

15:54.200 --> 15:55.999
I didn't even hit him that
hard. I just gave him a tap.

15:56.000 --> 15:57.279
- Nate...
- And he swung at me first.

15:57.280 --> 15:59.679
You ask the others, they'll tell
you, it was self-defence...

15:59.680 --> 16:00.920
Nate, sit down!

16:03.880 --> 16:05.559
Rhys and Dale, they saw the whole thing.

16:05.560 --> 16:08.200
Yeah, we'll get to them. What happened?

16:10.720 --> 16:11.720
Ty...

16:13.560 --> 16:15.159
Ty saw this.

16:15.160 --> 16:16.799
- RHYS: Tonight?
- WOMAN: Fresh air.

16:16.800 --> 16:18.319
(LAUGHS)

16:18.320 --> 16:20.039
- What's your name?
- I don't have one.

16:20.040 --> 16:22.159
(LAUGHS)

16:22.160 --> 16:24.119
Let go of me! Stop!

16:24.120 --> 16:27.760
- Fuck off! Fuck off!
- (LAUGHS)

16:29.360 --> 16:32.320
I wanna go home! Let me go!

16:33.520 --> 16:36.039
(LAUGHS) Yeah!

16:36.040 --> 16:38.840
- Fuck you!
- (LAUGHS)

16:45.280 --> 16:47.879
There goes she who was
about to be fucked!

16:47.880 --> 16:49.920
(LAUGHS)

16:54.000 --> 16:55.639
It was Ty's sister.

16:55.640 --> 16:58.279
I mean, they didn't know
it was his sister, but.

16:58.280 --> 17:00.559
They just thought it
was some random chick.

17:00.560 --> 17:01.680
Right.

17:01.681 --> 17:03.399
He was already aggro with Rhys and Dale

17:03.400 --> 17:04.959
and then when I came up he just went...

17:04.960 --> 17:07.159
he just went apeshit at me and
tried to punch my lights out.

17:07.160 --> 17:08.439
I've never touched his bloody sister.

17:08.440 --> 17:10.440
Really, I didn't hit him that hard.

17:12.760 --> 17:14.398
If I tell that cop it was self-defence,

17:14.400 --> 17:15.760
he will believe me, right?

17:16.920 --> 17:20.638
Uh, I'm afraid, with your history
of assault, he might not.

17:20.640 --> 17:22.680
So, what's your game plan?

17:25.800 --> 17:27.118
(TONY CHUCKLES)

17:27.119 --> 17:29.599
JANET: I got them some extra
coaching before the Zone Carnival.

17:29.600 --> 17:31.799
- Ah, they're gonna make Tokyo.
- Liam's keen.

17:31.800 --> 17:33.159
Emma could take it or leave it,

17:33.160 --> 17:35.599
despite almost breaking the
70-metre state record.

17:35.600 --> 17:38.119
I mean, with talent like that, she
really should give it a proper go.

17:38.120 --> 17:39.639
Well, let me know when
they're next racing

17:39.640 --> 17:41.759
and I'll come along and cheer
embarrassingly on the sidelines.

17:41.760 --> 17:42.760
They'd love that.

17:42.761 --> 17:45.719
Bonnie, we need a full
background of Pax Car Rentals,

17:45.720 --> 17:48.039
corporate structure,
board members, finances,

17:48.040 --> 17:50.119
how long they've sponsored the
Devils, the amount they...

17:50.120 --> 17:53.159
Whoa, whoa, whoa. You just
asked me to do Lucy Baldwin.

17:53.160 --> 17:55.479
And now I'm asking you to do this.

17:55.480 --> 17:57.960
You know, we'd get more work done
if you stayed in the office.

18:00.400 --> 18:01.920
Nice pants, but.

18:07.720 --> 18:09.200
(COMPUTER CHIMES)

18:11.360 --> 18:13.199
Oh, my God.

18:13.200 --> 18:15.280
Nate Baldwin's just killed
one of his teammates.

18:16.920 --> 18:18.959
- What?
- I've got alerts on all our POls.

18:18.960 --> 18:21.919
Internet's going off
like a frog in a sock.

18:21.920 --> 18:24.759
A fight at training. Nate
killed the guy with one punch.

18:24.760 --> 18:26.559
Baldwin just got off an assault charge.

18:26.560 --> 18:28.599
How's a thug like him still at the club?

18:28.600 --> 18:30.599
He wins games. Deadly on the field.

18:30.600 --> 18:32.119
And off it, apparently.

18:32.120 --> 18:34.399
"Mr Perati was arguing
with some of his teammates

18:34.400 --> 18:36.880
"following an incident at
a party on the weekend."

18:38.520 --> 18:40.239
There's a link.

18:40.240 --> 18:42.399
- Tonight?
- Fresh air.

18:42.400 --> 18:44.279
(LAUGHS) What's your name?

18:44.280 --> 18:45.480
I don't have one.

18:45.481 --> 18:48.759
Oh, come on! (LAUGHS)

18:48.760 --> 18:50.280
Jesus.

18:51.680 --> 18:53.599
DALE: Hey, great tits, darl!

18:53.600 --> 18:56.160
(LAUGHS)

18:58.760 --> 19:01.439
There goes she who was
about to be (BLEEP)!

19:01.440 --> 19:03.280
(LAUGHS)

19:07.520 --> 19:08.640
Classy.

19:08.641 --> 19:11.040
Overentitled boofheads behaving badly.

19:13.200 --> 19:15.319
Has Nate Baldwin been charged?

19:15.320 --> 19:17.320
Still helping with enquiries.

19:18.360 --> 19:20.639
ANDY: We've spoken with the eyewitness.

19:20.640 --> 19:23.119
Now tell us in your own
words what happened.

19:23.120 --> 19:24.440
No comment.

19:25.800 --> 19:28.079
How was it you came to strike Mr Perati?

19:28.080 --> 19:29.439
No comment.

19:29.440 --> 19:31.359
Nate, this is your
chance to clear the air,

19:31.360 --> 19:33.120
get your side of the
story on the record.

19:37.680 --> 19:39.160
No comment.

19:43.760 --> 19:45.080
Richard.

19:48.880 --> 19:50.799
You know, um, refusing
to make a statement

19:50.800 --> 19:52.159
makes him look guilty, right?

19:52.160 --> 19:53.959
If I was prosecuting, that's
exactly what I'd say too.

19:53.960 --> 19:55.799
You really have gone over to
the dark side, haven't you?

19:55.800 --> 19:57.800
- Are you going to arrest him?
- No comment.

20:05.280 --> 20:07.399
- There you go.
- Oh.

20:07.400 --> 20:10.119
Is this a 10-bucks-a-glass meet
for a quick drink, or a 15?

20:10.120 --> 20:11.439
Suck it and see.

20:11.440 --> 20:12.919
Nate Baldwin.

20:12.920 --> 20:14.519
What's the DPP gonna charge him with?

20:14.520 --> 20:16.639
You thinking manslaughter?
Involuntary manslaughter?

20:16.640 --> 20:18.839
Well, the DPP generally
waits for the autopsy

20:18.840 --> 20:21.199
and the police brief
before bringing charges,

20:21.200 --> 20:23.439
or have things changed
since you were here?

20:23.440 --> 20:26.479
Oh, causation's clear, he punched
the victim, the victim died.

20:26.480 --> 20:29.759
Well, either you're a closet
fan of another footy club

20:29.760 --> 20:31.759
and you want to make sure the
Devils lose their star player,

20:31.760 --> 20:34.439
or your interest in Baldwin
comes from another place.

20:34.440 --> 20:35.640
The NCC?

20:35.641 --> 20:37.759
Nate's name may have
come up in a reference.

20:37.760 --> 20:40.799
The one into, uh, corruption in sport?

20:40.800 --> 20:42.399
Don't worry, I won't put it on Facebook.

20:42.400 --> 20:44.359
Leverage to encourage him to
give full and frank evidence

20:44.360 --> 20:45.360
would be useful.

20:45.361 --> 20:46.639
There's a good chance of a conviction.

20:46.640 --> 20:48.519
He's got a history of violence,
there were witnesses...

20:48.520 --> 20:49.520
Hang on. This is like deja vu.

20:49.521 --> 20:52.239
It feels like you're telling
me how to do my job again.

20:52.240 --> 20:54.519
And by the way, I really shouldn't
be talking to you at all,

20:54.520 --> 20:56.639
you could be a witness
in an upcoming case.

20:56.640 --> 20:57.840
Really? What case is that?

20:57.841 --> 20:59.079
Bill Hawkins.

20:59.080 --> 21:01.679
Reckless driving occasioning the
death of a cricketing icon.

21:01.680 --> 21:02.959
You can't prosecute the bus driver.

21:02.960 --> 21:05.319
The preliminary police brief says
that he was arguing with a passenger

21:05.320 --> 21:06.759
and not looking at the road.

21:06.760 --> 21:08.079
No, Clay Nelson stepped in front...

21:08.080 --> 21:09.759
Further conversation
moves from inappropriate

21:09.760 --> 21:11.359
to attempting to pervert
the course of justice.

21:11.360 --> 21:12.919
You don't understand,
he may have actually...

21:12.920 --> 21:14.439
Listen, Janet.

21:14.440 --> 21:16.439
My great respect for due process

21:16.440 --> 21:18.599
leads me to tell you
to just... stop talking.

21:18.600 --> 21:20.199
BONNIE: Jaz!

21:20.200 --> 21:21.599
It's Janet, actually.

21:21.600 --> 21:23.439
I wouldn't have thought
this was your sort of vibe.

21:23.440 --> 21:24.440
Mm.

21:24.441 --> 21:26.039
Woman of many parts.

21:26.040 --> 21:27.879
Hi. Bonnie Mahesh. Work with Jaz.

21:27.880 --> 21:30.159
- Owen Mitchell.
- I know. Mr DPP.

21:30.160 --> 21:31.640
I'm late to pick up the kids.

21:32.840 --> 21:34.200
See ya, Jaz.

21:35.240 --> 21:36.999
Dick.

21:37.000 --> 21:38.399
Well, can you at least sit on the brief

21:38.400 --> 21:41.040
until the oxycodone's been traced?

21:42.200 --> 21:43.999
All right. Thanks, Andy.

21:44.000 --> 21:45.319
What about Nate?

21:45.320 --> 21:46.959
Is Owen going with manslaughter?

21:46.960 --> 21:48.919
He'll probably declare
insufficient to prosecute

21:48.920 --> 21:50.679
just to piss me off.

21:50.680 --> 21:53.199
- He's done that already.

22:05.800 --> 22:07.120
Concentrate!

22:08.280 --> 22:10.999
- Zoe DiCosta?
- Yeah, hi.

22:11.000 --> 22:12.599
It's like herding cats, right?

22:12.600 --> 22:14.239
Which one's yours?

22:14.240 --> 22:18.519
Uh, that ones... There. Uh, Liam.
And the other one, Emma.

22:18.520 --> 22:20.559
So, that one's yours, huh?

22:20.560 --> 22:22.319
I wondered where she came from.

22:22.320 --> 22:24.879
Runs high, quick legs. She's good.

22:24.880 --> 22:26.919
Yeah, so I've been told.

22:26.920 --> 22:28.719
Sorry. I'm Janet.

22:28.720 --> 22:29.800
Bianca.

22:29.801 --> 22:31.279
Can I just have a fan moment?

22:31.280 --> 22:34.519
That road race in Beijing when
you won gold, that was awesome.

22:34.520 --> 22:35.879
Thanks.

22:35.880 --> 22:37.839
- Are you still racing?
- Retired. Just coaching now.

22:37.840 --> 22:40.199
Ah. Any future champions
we should know about?

22:40.200 --> 22:41.799
Yeah, one girl's pretty good.

22:41.800 --> 22:44.319
She even broke my time
trial record last week.

22:44.320 --> 22:45.520
That hurt.

22:45.521 --> 22:48.159
Still, if she can stay focused,
she could be anything.

23:14.720 --> 23:17.439
Her brother's just died
and she's being blamed!

23:17.440 --> 23:19.719
Blaming and shaming,
social media's forte.

23:19.720 --> 23:21.959
The men in that video could be
charged with sexual assault,

23:21.960 --> 23:24.640
but sadly, it'd be deemed
low end of the scales.

23:26.040 --> 23:27.879
- Oh, wow!
- Oh.

23:27.880 --> 23:29.999
- That's lovely, Emma.
- That's beautiful.

23:30.000 --> 23:33.119
That's Mum, that's me, that's Liam.

23:33.120 --> 23:35.439
- And who's that?
- Uncle Tony.

23:35.440 --> 23:36.999
Can you give it to him, Mummy?

23:37.000 --> 23:38.879
Of course. He's gonna love that.

23:38.880 --> 23:39.920
I love it.

23:39.921 --> 23:42.159
Maybe next time you can draw a
special picture for Bianca.

23:42.160 --> 23:43.879
- What do you think?
- Maybe.

23:43.880 --> 23:46.239
All right, it's bedtime. Liam, bedtime.

23:46.240 --> 23:48.639
- I need to finish this level.
- No, you don't.

23:48.640 --> 23:50.079
I'll lose all my progress.

23:50.080 --> 23:53.799
Liam, if you pause it, I'll finish
the level for you before I go.

23:53.800 --> 23:55.919
I didn't know you could play.

23:55.920 --> 23:58.799
X is punch, A is jump,
Y is special moves?

23:58.800 --> 24:00.079
Thanks, Bee-Bee.

- Are you staying tonight?
- Maybe.

24:01.720 --> 24:03.480

24:04.920 --> 24:07.199
I didn't know you had
'gamer' on your CV.

24:07.200 --> 24:10.119
Oh, yeah. Misspent youth.

24:27.880 --> 24:29.719
WAYNE: That's quite a stride you've got.

24:29.720 --> 24:31.679
You could walk for your country.

24:31.680 --> 24:34.439
I see half our POls have
made the front page.

24:34.440 --> 24:36.120
"Accidental death."

24:39.480 --> 24:41.399
Any word from the state cops overnight?

24:41.400 --> 24:42.400
Nah, nothing.

24:42.401 --> 24:45.239
Anything from the DPP on Nate
being charged with manslaughter?

24:45.240 --> 24:47.599
No, just the usual Owen
Mitchell chest-beating.

24:47.600 --> 24:49.959
Well, the chairman of
Pax Car Rentals is in.

24:49.960 --> 24:51.840
Who scheduled a hearing this early?

24:55.840 --> 24:58.239
- BONNIE: Where have you been?
- Dropping my children to school.

24:58.240 --> 24:59.639
Oh see, that's why I don't want kids.

24:59.640 --> 25:01.719
Too much driving. Pax
chairman's in hearing room one.

25:01.720 --> 25:03.359
Yes, and I would have
appreciated being told

25:03.360 --> 25:04.839
that a hearing had been arranged.

25:04.840 --> 25:07.399
- Yeah, well early bird, worm.
- Background?

25:07.400 --> 25:09.559
Australian citizen, on the
boards of five companies,

25:09.560 --> 25:11.039
but Pax seems to be his main focus.

25:11.040 --> 25:12.559
It's been in serious financial Doo-Doo,

25:12.560 --> 25:14.919
though things have improved
over the last six months.

25:14.920 --> 25:16.759
But this guy's done
all right throughout.

25:16.760 --> 25:19.480
Got three investment properties,
lots of assets, labyrinthine...

25:27.200 --> 25:29.639
Two years ago, Pax Car Rentals
began their sponsorship

25:29.640 --> 25:33.159
of the Northern Devils Football Club
with the sum of 1 million dollars.

25:33.160 --> 25:36.799
Last year, the sponsorship was
increased to 1.5 million.

25:36.800 --> 25:41.720
Uh, entering the room is
Senior Counsel Ms Janet King.

26:01.120 --> 26:02.719
That is correct.

26:02.720 --> 26:04.079
1.5 million.

26:04.080 --> 26:05.839
That's very generous sponsorship

26:05.840 --> 26:07.839
for a team that was 1,000
to 1 to make the finals

26:07.840 --> 26:09.279
at the start of last season.

26:09.280 --> 26:11.839
Pax just wanted a reasonable
return on our investment,

26:11.840 --> 26:14.799
be associated with a club
that was competitive,

26:14.800 --> 26:17.159
that could take our name to the top.

26:17.160 --> 26:20.359
If you're not on top, you're failing.

26:20.360 --> 26:23.560
You must have been delighted with
their meteoric rise up the ladder.

26:25.440 --> 26:27.559
Delighted.

26:27.560 --> 26:29.120
Now, what's this about?

26:38.920 --> 26:41.439
During last season, the
Devils won several matches

26:41.440 --> 26:43.919
against much higher-ranked teams,

26:43.920 --> 26:46.119
games now under investigation
for match fixing.

26:46.120 --> 26:47.519
I don't know anything about that.

26:47.520 --> 26:49.799
Pax Car Rentals had financial trouble,

26:49.800 --> 26:53.399
but since the Devils did
so well, that's changed.

26:53.400 --> 26:54.600
As you said,

26:54.601 --> 26:57.039
sponsorship's only worth it
if the team's doing well.

26:57.040 --> 26:58.639
Tempting to guarantee it.

26:58.640 --> 27:02.079
Are you insinuating that I, as the
chairman of a successful company,

27:02.080 --> 27:04.839
am involved in football match fixing?

27:04.840 --> 27:06.839
We are suggesting that
you offered inducements

27:06.840 --> 27:08.999
to players from opposing teams to lose.

27:09.000 --> 27:10.359
I did not.

27:10.360 --> 27:12.239
Spending money to make
money. 1,000 to 1.

27:12.240 --> 27:15.199
- Sounds like a reasonable investment.
- I don't match fix.

27:15.200 --> 27:16.920
Nor do I gamble.

27:25.480 --> 27:27.319
We have your financial records.

27:27.320 --> 27:29.039
We'll trace every
transaction you've made.

27:29.040 --> 27:30.279
There are serious consequences

27:30.280 --> 27:32.159
for giving false information
to the Commission.

27:32.160 --> 27:35.999
Um, Ms King, do you have any questions?

27:36.000 --> 27:38.080
No, Mr Examiner, I don't.

27:47.120 --> 27:48.280
Janet!

27:48.281 --> 27:51.599
Thought you'd do your best Calypso
impression, sit silent on a rock?

27:51.600 --> 27:53.479
I didn't want to compromise the hearing.

27:53.480 --> 27:54.999
How could you compromise the hearing?

27:55.000 --> 27:56.959
That man. The witness.

27:56.960 --> 27:58.399
He's my father.

27:58.400 --> 27:59.759
Your father?!

27:59.760 --> 28:02.039
Graham... King, chairman
of Pax Car Rentals?

28:02.040 --> 28:03.399
I didn't know he was chairman.

28:03.400 --> 28:05.119
I don't know what he
does, where he works.

28:05.120 --> 28:06.799
- We're not... close.
- Clearly.

28:06.800 --> 28:08.639
Janet, if your father's one
of this reference's POls,

28:08.640 --> 28:09.720
you can't question him.

28:09.751 --> 28:10.665
Which is why I didn't.

28:10.720 --> 28:11.800
Well, even being in the same room

28:11.801 --> 28:13.319
could be construed as a
conflict of interest.

28:13.320 --> 28:15.719
There's no conflict of interest,
because I'm not interested in him.

28:15.720 --> 28:17.399
- Did you know about this?
- Bonnie Mahesh speaking.

28:17.400 --> 28:19.039
- Of course not.
- Well, you've gotta step back.

28:19.040 --> 28:20.839
This is absurd. I haven't
spoken to him in years.

28:20.840 --> 28:23.039
Shh! It's piping hot Mr Mitchell.

28:23.040 --> 28:24.839
Look, I didn't ask him a question,

28:24.840 --> 28:26.599
and if his name comes up
in the reference again

28:26.600 --> 28:28.399
I will consult with you and Bianca.

28:28.400 --> 28:30.479
But there's no conflict of interest.

28:30.480 --> 28:32.639
I am perfectly capable of doing my job.

28:32.640 --> 28:33.640
Owen.

28:33.641 --> 28:36.199
Did that young colleague of
yours just call me piping hot?

28:36.200 --> 28:38.279
Is this about Nate Baldwin?

28:38.280 --> 28:40.119
Tyler Perati's post-mortem is in.

28:40.120 --> 28:41.799
And?

28:41.800 --> 28:44.639
Well, he's got a bruise on his
face the size of Tasmania.

28:44.640 --> 28:46.360
"Just tapped him" my arse.

28:49.960 --> 28:50.960
JOURNALIST: Nate! Nate!

28:50.961 --> 28:53.239
JOURNALIST: How do you feel about
being charged with manslaughter?

28:53.240 --> 28:55.199
My client's been bailed. We
have no further comment.

28:55.200 --> 28:56.839
Have you seen the video
of Tyler Perati's sister?

28:56.840 --> 28:58.040
Were you there when it was recorded?

28:58.041 --> 28:59.479
What was your involvement
in the incident?

28:59.480 --> 29:01.079
Anything you want to say
to the Perati family?

29:01.080 --> 29:03.000
- Why don't you fuck...
- My client has no comment.

29:04.960 --> 29:06.879
For God's sake, Nate,
silence is your friend.

29:06.880 --> 29:08.919
- Nate, listen to Richard.
- But those bastards are fucking...

29:08.920 --> 29:10.640
And it doesn't help to swear.

29:13.600 --> 29:15.519
You're required at the NCC.

29:15.520 --> 29:16.760
Shit.

29:18.760 --> 29:21.039
JANET: Mr Baldwin, you
placed several online bets

29:21.040 --> 29:23.360
on sporting events we
know to have been fixed.

29:24.440 --> 29:26.080
Who'd you place those bets for?

29:28.840 --> 29:30.279
I just say "no comment", right?

29:30.280 --> 29:31.919
In this place, you have
no right not to answer.

29:31.920 --> 29:33.080
You've gotta say something.

29:33.081 --> 29:35.479
I'll ask again. Who'd you
place those bets for?

29:35.480 --> 29:36.959
Myself.

29:36.960 --> 29:39.160
And I never knew anything
about fixed matches.

29:41.120 --> 29:44.559
Did Darren Faulkes ask you
to place those bets for him?

29:44.560 --> 29:45.720
No.

29:45.721 --> 29:48.999
Well, he's a powerful man, a
man it'd be hard to say no to.

29:49.000 --> 29:52.199
Yeah, well he's never asked me to
do nothin' for him but play good.

29:52.200 --> 29:54.919
All right, what about your major
sponsors, Pax Car Rentals?

29:54.920 --> 29:56.159
What about 'em?

29:56.160 --> 29:58.679
Did anyone from Pax coerce you
or any other player in any way?

29:58.680 --> 29:59.680
No.

29:59.681 --> 30:01.399
Mr Baldwin, this morning
you were charged...

30:01.400 --> 30:02.879
Last season, you won four games

30:02.880 --> 30:05.919
courtesy of some remarkably
poor play by your opponents.

30:05.920 --> 30:09.479
Uh, we've got the Falcons
in June, Bull Ants July,

30:09.480 --> 30:13.159
the Gryphons twice, in
both July and August.

30:13.160 --> 30:17.159
We believe someone paid players
in those teams to throw matches,

30:17.160 --> 30:19.479
which, well, can only be a big gambler

30:19.480 --> 30:21.799
who'd bet a lot of money
on the Devils winning,

30:21.800 --> 30:23.399
or a major investor,

30:23.400 --> 30:25.359
who wouldn't get a bang for
their buck if you lost,

30:25.360 --> 30:27.119
like... Pax Car Rentals.

30:27.120 --> 30:30.119
I don't know anything about that,
all right? I just play footy.

30:30.120 --> 30:34.279
Yeah, if I may step in, Madam Examiner.

30:34.280 --> 30:37.039
Mr Baldwin, this morning you
were charged with manslaughter.

30:37.040 --> 30:38.919
You could be facing up
to 20 years in jail.

30:38.920 --> 30:41.079
If you cooperate with
us we'll tell the DPP.

30:41.080 --> 30:43.039
They'll take your cooperation
into consideration

30:43.040 --> 30:44.559
in their recommendation
for sentencing...

30:44.560 --> 30:46.559
It was self-defence. I'll get off.

30:46.560 --> 30:48.999
I wouldn't be so sure about that.

30:49.000 --> 30:52.079
Juries can be very hostile
about one-punch attacks,

30:52.080 --> 30:54.479
and given your history of
violence, if I was your lawyer,

30:54.480 --> 30:57.159
I'd be urging you to get as many
people in your corner as possible.

30:57.160 --> 31:00.079
But you're not my lawyer. He is.

31:00.080 --> 31:03.040
And I only gave Tyler a tap
because he came at me.

31:04.360 --> 31:06.480
Stirlo will get me off.

31:19.360 --> 31:20.839
Thanks, mate.

31:20.840 --> 31:22.319
LUCY: So, what happens now?

31:22.320 --> 31:24.119
I'll talk to the witnesses
to the fight with Tyler,

31:24.120 --> 31:26.119
corroborate Nate's version of events.

31:26.120 --> 31:27.479
I just wish I'd been there

31:27.480 --> 31:29.439
when Rhys and Dale were giving
Ty's sister a hard time.

31:29.440 --> 31:31.079
If someone had just
stopped the dickheads

31:31.080 --> 31:32.759
and told them to leave her alone,

31:32.760 --> 31:34.240
none of this would have happened.

31:37.680 --> 31:39.919
JANET: "The deceased's blood
results present a platelet count"

31:39.920 --> 31:42.319
"substantially below normal
range," dah-dah-dah,

31:42.320 --> 31:44.239
"leading to death by
cerebral haemorrhage."

31:44.240 --> 31:46.599
Why would Tyler's blood
have low platelets?

31:46.600 --> 31:48.999
- Maybe he took something.
- Yeah, toxicology's clear.

31:49.000 --> 31:51.399
They've tested for a range
of PEDs. It's all negative.

31:51.400 --> 31:52.999
Could be on something new.

31:53.000 --> 31:55.679
Autopsies only pick up
on known substances.

31:55.680 --> 31:56.840
You'll have to do another test.

31:56.841 --> 31:58.159
Can you organise a broader blood test?

31:58.160 --> 31:59.280
- Sure.
- Don't mind me.

31:59.281 --> 32:01.479
Just checking in, to see where
the reference is heading.

32:01.480 --> 32:04.479
Only athletes who are doping
are way ahead of the testers.

32:04.480 --> 32:05.839
ASADA eventually catches up,

32:05.840 --> 32:08.639
but by then some bright spark
with a biochem degree's

32:08.640 --> 32:10.399
already invented a new juice.

32:10.400 --> 32:13.199
Wayne was in a training squad for
the English National League.

32:13.200 --> 32:15.519
Dartford. By age 20.

32:15.520 --> 32:17.879
Nothing like a ruptured ACL to
kill off your hopes and dreams.

32:17.880 --> 32:18.920
Ahh.

32:18.921 --> 32:20.719
Could a side effect of a
PED be low platelets?

32:20.720 --> 32:22.639
Yeah, the sports docs
warned us off doping

32:22.640 --> 32:24.199
by listing the side effects.

32:24.200 --> 32:28.119
So, blood won't coagulate,
arteries and veins will collapse,

32:28.120 --> 32:29.599
blood pressure will skyrocket,

32:29.600 --> 32:31.599
liver will stuff up, kidneys will fail.

32:31.600 --> 32:33.319
You'll get cancer, you
won't be able to get...

32:33.320 --> 32:35.199
Janet, could I have a word?

32:35.200 --> 32:36.920
Yes, Tony?

32:38.360 --> 32:40.239
This reference is about
corruption in sport,

32:40.240 --> 32:42.599
with the aim to discover and
recover the proceeds of crime.

32:42.600 --> 32:44.479
Can you tell me how discovering
what, if anything,

32:44.480 --> 32:46.399
this young man had in
system fits into that?

32:46.400 --> 32:48.679
Well, the Devils were part of
a chain of betting spikes.

32:48.680 --> 32:50.199
They're suspected of match fixing.

32:50.200 --> 32:52.439
A man with powerful criminal connections

32:52.440 --> 32:53.999
is associated with the club.

32:54.000 --> 32:57.039
Pax Car Rentals have invested huge money

32:57.040 --> 32:58.759
in them staying in the top four.

32:58.760 --> 33:00.119
So, in that environment,

33:00.120 --> 33:02.319
it's entirely possible players
like Tyler were doping.

33:02.320 --> 33:03.919
Well, that's ASADA's problem, not ours.

33:03.920 --> 33:04.920
No, it is ours.

33:04.921 --> 33:06.959
If Tyler was taking something,
the whole team could have too,

33:06.960 --> 33:09.079
which means someone is
cheating on a massive scale.

33:09.080 --> 33:11.479
Oh, that's a long bow, with your
father clearly the target...

33:11.480 --> 33:12.919
Which falls clearly within our purview.

33:12.920 --> 33:14.359
And the events of this
morning have in no way

33:14.360 --> 33:16.239
steered you towards this
particular line of enquiry...

33:16.240 --> 33:17.240
Facts have steered me, Tony.

33:17.241 --> 33:18.839
- You can't go gallivanting off...
- You asked me..

33:18.840 --> 33:20.559
- On a personal vendetta.
- To run this reference.

33:20.560 --> 33:21.999
- You've had a huge shock.
- So, coffee anyone?

33:22.000 --> 33:23.839
Again, all I'm asking is
you take a step back,

33:23.840 --> 33:25.799
- and regain your objectivity.
- Well thanks, Tony.

33:25.800 --> 33:27.920
But I don't need two fathers in my life!

33:29.840 --> 33:31.040
Fine.

33:31.041 --> 33:32.759
Run it your way.

33:32.760 --> 33:35.600
But don't you ever cut me off
in front of a witness again.

33:44.400 --> 33:46.399
Who knew you had even one father?

33:46.400 --> 33:48.519
Yeah, well everyone's got a father.

33:48.520 --> 33:50.440
Some are just more useless than others.

33:53.800 --> 33:55.039
Wayne, you're coming with me.

33:55.040 --> 33:56.360
- Yeah, can I just...
- Now.

33:57.360 --> 33:58.440
Oh!

34:55.800 --> 34:58.199
YANNI: Terrible tragedy.
We're all shattered.

34:58.200 --> 35:01.919
For Tyler's family, and for Nate
and his family too, frankly.

35:01.920 --> 35:04.199
What's the Crime Commission's
interest in his death?

35:04.200 --> 35:06.159
WAYNE: We're conducting
a broad investigation.

35:06.160 --> 35:08.679
What sort of supplements
program do you run?

35:08.680 --> 35:10.399
- Supplements?
- Yeah.

35:10.400 --> 35:12.079
All supplements we give our players

35:12.080 --> 35:14.479
are triple-checked and
guaranteed ASADA approved.

35:14.480 --> 35:16.639
It's a complex science, I imagine.

35:16.640 --> 35:17.760
Very.

35:17.761 --> 35:20.799
Eddie Cook, our biochemist at
Continuum Therapy, world class.

35:20.800 --> 35:24.159
Individual players are advised
what they can and can't take?

35:24.160 --> 35:27.879
We do ASADA-approved education programs

35:27.880 --> 35:29.599
through Continuum and
the coaching staff.

35:29.600 --> 35:31.519
- What's this really about?
- Well...

35:31.520 --> 35:33.959
There were some anomalies
in Mr Perati's autopsy.

35:33.960 --> 35:35.199
What kind of anomalies?

35:35.200 --> 35:37.119
Indications he may have taken a PED

35:37.120 --> 35:39.319
not currently identified by ASADA.

35:39.320 --> 35:41.559
Any idea where he might have
got something like that?

35:41.560 --> 35:42.999
It wasn't through us.

35:43.000 --> 35:45.279
We're careful about giving
our players an aspirin.

35:45.280 --> 35:47.999
Whatever Tyler took, did it
affect him, like negatively?

35:48.000 --> 35:49.239
Well, we can't say.

35:49.240 --> 35:52.319
What was, um... what was Tyler like?

35:52.320 --> 35:55.079
Oh, he was fast for his size.

35:55.080 --> 35:58.079
Strong, good skills on the ball.

35:58.080 --> 36:01.759
Yeah, had a bright future at
the club, didn't he Mitchell?

36:01.760 --> 36:03.239
Angelou.

36:03.240 --> 36:04.479
Excuse me.

36:04.480 --> 36:05.560
G'day, mate...

36:05.561 --> 36:07.359
Can you think of any
reason why he might take

36:07.360 --> 36:09.600
a performance-enhancing
drug without you knowing?

36:11.000 --> 36:12.359
Ty was a very good player.

36:12.360 --> 36:14.039
Was he going to make first grade?

36:14.040 --> 36:16.559
I mean, you've got a pool of blokes
to choose your top players from...

36:16.560 --> 36:18.519
Ty was close to breaking through.

36:18.520 --> 36:21.080
But there were other blokes who
were just that much closer?

36:24.600 --> 36:27.399
The pressure on these young
blokes is fucked, all right?

36:27.400 --> 36:30.439
Their whole family is banking
on them to make a lot of money.

36:30.440 --> 36:31.440
Right?

36:31.441 --> 36:34.559
They've got such a short window
before some career-ending injury.

36:34.560 --> 36:35.999
You can hardly blame them

36:36.000 --> 36:37.879
for wanting to make the
most of their chances.

36:37.880 --> 36:39.640
So, if Ty thought he mightn't
have made the cut...

36:40.640 --> 36:42.159
do you think he could
have taken something

36:42.160 --> 36:43.840
to help give himself that extra edge?

36:53.640 --> 36:54.840
Yeah.

37:05.720 --> 37:07.999
EMMA: Hey, Mum, did you see that one?
It was perfect.

37:08.000 --> 37:09.399
Yes, darling, that was wonderful.

37:09.400 --> 37:11.079
Why don't you do another
one and I'll take a photo.

37:11.080 --> 37:13.399
- Okay.
- LIAM: Look, Mum! Look at me!

37:13.400 --> 37:15.439
Oh, that's good. Liam.

37:15.440 --> 37:17.680
- Just don't go too high, all right?
- Okay.

37:19.840 --> 37:21.480
(PHONE CHIMES)

37:31.560 --> 37:33.519
- (THUD)
- Ow!

37:33.520 --> 37:35.999
- Liam! Are you all right?
- Ow!

37:36.000 --> 37:37.759
- Ow!
- Don't touch it, okay?

37:37.760 --> 37:39.799
- Where does it hurt? Show Mummy.
- Ow!

37:39.800 --> 37:41.039
It's all right. Don't touch it.

37:41.040 --> 37:42.879
So, remember what the doctor said.

37:42.880 --> 37:45.479
You need to keep it up as much as
you can. All right, sweetheart?

37:45.480 --> 37:47.359
It was my turn for the top bunk.

37:47.360 --> 37:49.199
Well Emma will give you her turn.

37:49.200 --> 37:50.799
- Won't you, Em?
- Maybe.

37:50.800 --> 37:52.479
And I wanted to run at Zone.

37:52.480 --> 37:55.039
Well, maybe it'll be better by zone.

37:55.040 --> 37:57.439
Anyway, it doesn't matter if...

37:57.440 --> 38:00.639
Ah, Liam, that's enough screen
time for tonight, all right?

38:00.640 --> 38:02.319
(PHONE RINGS)

38:02.320 --> 38:03.680
Bianca. Hi.

38:04.680 --> 38:07.239
Yeah, I'm with the kids.
Yeah, he's all right.

38:07.240 --> 38:09.639
Thanks. Look, can I call you back?

38:09.640 --> 38:11.280
Thank you. Bye.

38:17.880 --> 38:19.999
Liam, off. Don't make me repeat myself.

38:20.000 --> 38:23.519
JANET: (ON GAME SPEAKER) Liam, off.
Don't make me repeat myself.

38:23.520 --> 38:25.120
Stop being a pest.

38:26.240 --> 38:28.879
JANET: (ON GAME SPEAKER)
Stop being a pest.

38:28.880 --> 38:32.239
My name is Liam and I
must obey my mother.

38:32.240 --> 38:35.600
JANET: (ON GAME SPEAKER) My name
is Liam and I must obey my mother.

38:39.040 --> 38:41.479
All right, 10 more minutes.

38:41.480 --> 38:43.279
Does your brother
always get his own way?

38:43.280 --> 38:45.120
- Yeah.
- I think so too.

38:50.920 --> 38:53.799
The spectrophotometric results
on Tyler's blood have come in.

38:53.800 --> 38:55.079
What does it say?

38:55.080 --> 38:57.599
Blah, blah, metabolites, blah,
blah, acid-based regulation,

38:57.600 --> 38:58.839
blah, blah, plasma.

38:58.840 --> 39:01.199
It's in science-ese,
need a PhD in chemistry.

39:01.200 --> 39:02.759
Wayne!

39:02.760 --> 39:04.879
Wayne has a PhD in chemistry?

39:04.880 --> 39:07.399
WAYNE: This confirms he was
on a foreign substance.

39:07.400 --> 39:09.719
Probably something new
ASADA hadn't seen yet.

39:09.720 --> 39:11.999
This thing he's on, would it
affect his platelet count?

39:12.000 --> 39:13.519
I can't tell without
knowing what it was.

39:13.520 --> 39:16.119
- Well, how do we find this substance?
- We need to find more of it.

39:16.120 --> 39:20.599
Right. Let's talk to the Devils'
biochemist and the Perati family.

39:20.600 --> 39:22.599
Can it wait until this arvo?
I've got a meeting.

39:22.600 --> 39:24.639
I'd rather go now.

39:24.640 --> 39:25.999
Okay, well, I'll push it.

39:26.000 --> 39:28.120
It's fine. I'll go with Wayne.

39:29.240 --> 39:31.000
She finds me irresistible.

39:35.400 --> 39:37.559
JANET: Thanks for making
the time to see us.

39:37.560 --> 39:40.359
Yanni, the Chairman of the Devils,
said you'd probably be coming.

39:40.360 --> 39:42.599
Some of our hyperbaric chambers.

39:42.600 --> 39:43.919
Hey, Flynn. All good?

39:43.920 --> 39:46.319
Yeah. Just set up Mr
Collins' saturative.

39:46.320 --> 39:48.599
Hyperbaric therapy is a marvel.

39:48.600 --> 39:51.159
It improves and speeds
up healing and recovery

39:51.160 --> 39:52.839
for diseased or damaged tissue.

39:52.840 --> 39:54.999
You've worked with the
Northern Devils for a while?

39:55.000 --> 39:58.679
Last two seasons. Very proud
of our association with them.

39:58.680 --> 40:01.719
Our media people did some
deal with Nate and Lucy,

40:01.720 --> 40:03.719
but I suppose we'll have to revisit it,

40:03.720 --> 40:05.679
seeing Nate's in trouble again.

40:05.680 --> 40:09.079
But publicity's not my field,
I'm just a humble scientist.

40:09.080 --> 40:11.799
What therapies are you giving
the current Devils players?

40:11.800 --> 40:15.799
HBO pre and post game,
circulating stem cells CD34+,

40:15.800 --> 40:18.679
growth factors,
anti-inflammatory interleukins,

40:18.680 --> 40:20.399
pro-inflammatory interleukins.

40:20.400 --> 40:21.919
Cytokine profile testing

40:21.920 --> 40:23.839
for the guys nearing the
end of their careers.

40:23.840 --> 40:27.679
It's all in there. Nothing
WADA or ASADA banned.

40:27.680 --> 40:30.879
Wouldn't stay in business long
if my clients lost their jobs.

40:30.880 --> 40:32.839
Did you know Tyler Perati?

40:32.840 --> 40:35.480
Of course. It's a terrible tragedy.

40:36.480 --> 40:38.119
He hadn't quite reached first grade,

40:38.120 --> 40:40.599
so I didn't see him as frequently
as some of the other boys.

40:40.600 --> 40:43.239
And he received the same
therapies as the other players?

40:43.240 --> 40:44.839
Adjusted for body mass.

40:44.840 --> 40:46.839
We'll need samples of all the substances

40:46.840 --> 40:50.519
he was given last season,
and this, and his records.

40:50.520 --> 40:52.479
Of course.

40:52.480 --> 40:54.680
I'll have Flynn send them over.

40:59.360 --> 41:00.959
Pretty cooperative.

41:00.960 --> 41:02.800
With a whiff of snake oil.

41:04.080 --> 41:06.520
We should go and talk to
Tyler Perati's parents.

41:07.880 --> 41:08.880
Come back!

41:08.881 --> 41:10.719
If you hadn't flashed your
tits all over the internet

41:10.720 --> 41:11.920
none of this would've happened, okay?

41:11.921 --> 41:13.279
None of this would've fuckin' happened!

41:13.280 --> 41:15.079
- You're a disgrace!
- PEARL: I'M the fuckin' disgrace?!

41:15.080 --> 41:17.319
- MAN: Watch your...
- You are a fuckin' disgrace!

41:17.320 --> 41:19.799
- Oi, you watch your fuckin' mouth!
- Police! Police!

41:19.800 --> 41:21.439
Mrs Perati!

41:21.440 --> 41:24.319
Detective Senior Constable
Page, New South Wales Police.

41:24.320 --> 41:25.799
My associate, Ms King.

41:25.800 --> 41:27.599
We'd like to ask you a few
questions about your son.

41:27.600 --> 41:29.759
- This isn't a good time.
- We're fuckin' grieving.

41:29.760 --> 41:30.999
Who are you, mate?

41:31.000 --> 41:33.839
Kevin. Riley. Viki's fiancé.

41:33.840 --> 41:36.119
We're making inquiries into
Tyler's possible drug use.

41:36.120 --> 41:37.719
- No drugs here.
- Not drugs.

41:37.720 --> 41:39.719
Medicines, or supplements
he might have taken.

41:39.720 --> 41:41.599
Perhaps to help with
injuries or train harder?

41:41.600 --> 41:42.600
Nup.

41:42.601 --> 41:45.039
His coach reckoned he'd do
whatever it took to be graded.

41:45.040 --> 41:47.399
He was always training.
It's all he thought about.

41:47.400 --> 41:48.959
We don't know anything about drugs.

41:48.960 --> 41:50.959
Ty'd never bring anything
like that into this house.

41:50.960 --> 41:52.239
It's Pearl, isn't it?

41:52.240 --> 41:53.839
He was gonna make first
grade and buy me a house.

41:53.840 --> 41:55.079
I'm Janet.

41:55.080 --> 41:57.199
I'm really sorry about your brother.

41:57.200 --> 41:58.639
I saw you at the clubhouse.

41:58.640 --> 42:00.279
The flowers you left him
were really beautiful.

42:00.280 --> 42:01.280
Thanks.

42:01.281 --> 42:03.119
Where'd you get money
for fuckin' flowers?

42:03.120 --> 42:05.879
- If you've been pinching...
- Hey, easy mate! Easy!

42:05.880 --> 42:08.240
I'm speaking to my fuckin'
stepdaughter, all right?!

42:15.640 --> 42:18.720
Under a lot of stress, aren't we Pearly?

42:19.840 --> 42:21.599
You gotta understand.

42:21.600 --> 42:23.839
Tyler's death's been upsetting enough.

42:23.840 --> 42:26.999
You coming around, implying he
was some kind of drug cheat,

42:27.000 --> 42:29.639
not to mention all those internet trolls

42:29.640 --> 42:31.640
saying those terrible
things about Pearl.

42:32.800 --> 42:35.199
I really have to ask you to...

42:35.200 --> 42:37.240
to leave us in peace, right?

42:54.080 --> 42:57.199
How old is she? 15?
Having to live like that.

42:57.200 --> 42:59.759
Shows you why Tyler was so
determined to make first grade.

42:59.760 --> 43:02.399
Yeah, get his sister
out of that hellhole.

43:02.400 --> 43:03.759
Um, sorry.

43:03.760 --> 43:05.680
You go on. I'll just be a minute.

43:20.680 --> 43:22.359
I didn't get your reply.

43:22.360 --> 43:24.000
I didn't send one.

43:27.280 --> 43:29.000
Good to see you too, sweetheart.

43:34.560 --> 43:37.559
So, the twins, they'd be six, seven now?

43:37.560 --> 43:39.079
Something like that.

43:39.080 --> 43:41.599
Terrific age. You can
just start to mould them.

43:41.600 --> 43:44.400
They're children, Dad, not Play-Doh.

43:45.400 --> 43:49.719
Be good to meet them, now
that you're back in the country.

43:49.720 --> 43:51.320
If you can make time.

43:53.240 --> 43:54.959
You still in the same place?

43:54.960 --> 43:56.199
Yep. What do you want?

43:56.200 --> 43:59.199
Janet, please, manners.
What would your mother say?

43:59.200 --> 44:00.640
She'd say, "What do you want?"

44:02.240 --> 44:03.720
Just a catch-up.

44:05.240 --> 44:07.999
National Crime Commission, eh?

44:08.000 --> 44:10.239
What about it?

44:10.240 --> 44:13.600
Just I thought you'd be Judge
of the Supreme Court by now.

44:14.800 --> 44:17.399
Inquisitorial litigation has its perks.

44:17.400 --> 44:19.080
Unlike you to take a backward step.

44:20.080 --> 44:22.879
Now, that Royal Commission you
did, that had some teeth.

44:22.880 --> 44:25.479
Well, that's the thing
about coercive powers.

44:25.480 --> 44:27.879
The NCC has teeth and a very wide jaw.

44:27.880 --> 44:30.000
You just don't know if
you've been bitten.

44:35.760 --> 44:37.960
(DOOR SLIDES OPEN)

44:55.960 --> 44:58.239
He's hiding something.

44:58.240 --> 44:59.639
The way he reacted just now

44:59.640 --> 45:01.679
when I said the NCC had
wide-reaching powers,

45:01.680 --> 45:04.039
he was spooked, which is not
something my father often gets.

45:04.040 --> 45:06.679
Perhaps I need my ears tested,
because I could have sworn

45:06.680 --> 45:09.119
I heard you say you had next
to no contact with him.

45:09.120 --> 45:11.439
- I don't, but he texted me...
- Sounds like contact.

45:11.440 --> 45:14.200
And we need to check his phones
and find out what he's hiding.

45:17.640 --> 45:19.559
Look, I know you think
I'm not being objective,

45:19.560 --> 45:20.560
but these are the facts.

45:20.561 --> 45:23.599
My father has barely sent me
a birthday card in years.

45:23.600 --> 45:26.079
And what, the day after
he gets called in here

45:26.080 --> 45:27.999
he gets in contact, and he's fishing.

45:28.000 --> 45:29.759
- Fishing?
- I know him, Tony.

45:29.760 --> 45:31.239
Without having seen him in years.

45:31.240 --> 45:32.800
Yeah, he hasn't changed.

45:37.440 --> 45:39.599
I'll authorise a search
of his phone records.

45:39.600 --> 45:44.159
If... if they contain information
analysis deems worth pursuing

45:44.160 --> 45:48.039
I'll discuss with Bianca
a possible phone tap.

45:48.040 --> 45:51.879
So, when was the last time you
saw this illustrious patriarch?

45:51.880 --> 45:54.999
Oh, four or five years. I can't recall.

45:55.000 --> 45:56.040
Anyway, look,

45:56.041 --> 45:59.199
it seems that Tyler Perati was on
something beyond your average PED.

45:59.200 --> 46:00.759
It's not on ASADA's banned list,

46:00.760 --> 46:02.919
which means it's unlikely to
be available in Australia.

46:02.920 --> 46:05.719
Illegal importations. Now
you're singing my team song.

46:05.720 --> 46:09.200
And I've got Bouncy going through
Continuum Therapy's records.

46:10.200 --> 46:11.840
I believe her name's Bonnie.

46:19.400 --> 46:21.039
OWEN: (OVER PHONE)
So, what's taking so long?

46:21.040 --> 46:24.319
Oh, checking witness statements,
going through CCTV,

46:24.320 --> 46:26.159
running forensics on the bus's brakes,

46:26.160 --> 46:28.279
going through the
driver's driving record.

46:28.280 --> 46:30.079
Not to mention, Clay Nelson
isn't the only sports star

46:30.080 --> 46:31.200
to hit my desk recently.

46:31.201 --> 46:33.279
Nobody cares about Tyler Perati, mate.

46:33.280 --> 46:35.159
It's demigod Clay Nelson
the public are crying for.

46:35.160 --> 46:36.439
I've had the Sports Minister

46:36.440 --> 46:38.119
and the Premier on the
phone this morning.

46:38.120 --> 46:40.679
Mate, when the brief is ready,
if we think it's strong,

46:40.680 --> 46:42.200
then we'll present it.

46:44.040 --> 46:45.719
Owen might be breathing down my neck

46:45.720 --> 46:47.359
to deliver a brief
against the bus driver,

46:47.360 --> 46:50.359
but that Oxycodone found
on Clay's coffee table?

46:50.360 --> 46:51.640
It was stolen.

46:52.960 --> 46:54.439
Came from a batch that went missing

46:54.440 --> 46:56.439
from the Greater Southern
District Hospital.

46:56.440 --> 46:58.079
I mean, it had to come
via the black market,

46:58.080 --> 47:00.839
but we've got no evidence
Clay was an opiate user.

47:00.840 --> 47:03.479
Other than Clay's, any
fingerprints on the packet?

47:03.480 --> 47:04.919
Nothing on the system.

47:04.920 --> 47:07.840
Whoever visited Clay that
night must have brought it.

47:09.160 --> 47:10.559
What did Clay's son say?

47:10.560 --> 47:11.959
Just about to question him.

47:11.960 --> 47:13.199
I'll bring the recording around.

47:13.200 --> 47:14.560
Thanks, Andy.

47:18.200 --> 47:19.519
What happened after dinner?

47:19.520 --> 47:21.279
REED: Dad and me played video games.

47:21.280 --> 47:24.439
Just the two of you, or did
Dad have a friend round?

47:24.440 --> 47:25.879
Just us.

47:25.880 --> 47:29.920
And what about later on?
Did anyone call or pop by?

47:33.680 --> 47:35.800
Yeah, there... there was someone.

47:37.080 --> 47:38.919
You know who?

47:38.920 --> 47:42.480
You can't say what they
looked like? Guy? Girl?

47:43.640 --> 47:46.200
I never saw them. Dad sent me to bed.

47:50.800 --> 47:55.079
I didn't want to stop playing
the game, and I got mad

47:55.080 --> 47:56.920
and Dad got mad at me back.

47:58.440 --> 48:01.200
He said we'd finish the
level. He... he promised.

48:02.920 --> 48:05.640
I don't get to see him much
'cause he's always away.

48:06.840 --> 48:08.240
So...

48:13.680 --> 48:16.439
- Can we stop?
- Yeah.

48:16.440 --> 48:17.999
We're no closer to Clay's visitor

48:18.000 --> 48:19.439
and there's no connection with the oxy.

48:19.440 --> 48:22.399
As far as we're concerned,
it's not a suspicious death.

48:22.400 --> 48:23.520
That poor kid,

48:23.521 --> 48:27.119
beating himself up because of
a fight over a video game.

48:27.120 --> 48:28.800
Liam and I, we...

48:38.440 --> 48:40.320
What game was he playing?

48:45.800 --> 48:47.279
Have you checked it?

48:47.280 --> 48:48.600
No.

48:54.960 --> 48:57.519
These headphones record.

48:57.520 --> 49:00.119
- REED: (ON RECORDING) Oh, no!
- CLAY: Oh yes, yes, yes!

49:00.120 --> 49:01.599
- Yes!
- Oh!

49:01.600 --> 49:02.919
I got it. Come on, yeah, that's it.

49:02.920 --> 49:03.920
Okay, here we go.

49:03.921 --> 49:05.479
I'm still in front. I'm still in front.

49:05.480 --> 49:07.079
Hang on, have I got the
brake on or something?

49:07.080 --> 49:10.359
Come on, let's go! Oh
come on, one wheel!

49:10.360 --> 49:12.199
Let's go. Yes. And that's it.

49:12.200 --> 49:13.999
Ready, ready, ready,
ready, ready, ready!

49:14.000 --> 49:15.759
Oh come on, get it, get it, get it, yes.

49:15.760 --> 49:16.999
Oh...! Oh, backflip.

49:17.000 --> 49:18.519
I win! Sucked in!

49:18.520 --> 49:20.279
(BOTH LAUGH)

49:20.280 --> 49:21.559
You're done mate, you're done.

49:21.560 --> 49:23.320
- Nuh.
- You're done.

49:31.360 --> 49:34.800
Rich, mate, I'd like to go over a
couple of things for tomorrow.

49:36.320 --> 49:38.039
Why don't you brush your
teeth, get into bed

49:38.040 --> 49:39.359
and I'll read you the
rest of that story.

49:39.360 --> 49:41.279
Come on, but you promised we'd
finish this level. Come on.

49:41.280 --> 49:42.799
- Just get in bed and I'll...
- You promised!

49:42.800 --> 49:44.240
Just hang on a second. I'll...

49:45.640 --> 49:47.799
(CLATTERING)

49:47.800 --> 49:51.119
- Mate, um, I was thinking...
- (BANGING AT DOOR)

49:51.120 --> 49:52.640
Just give me a sec, will ya?

49:54.800 --> 49:56.479
(PHONE RINGS)

49:56.480 --> 49:59.040
Rich, I'll call you back, mate. See ya.

50:00.440 --> 50:02.519
MAN: Mate, I just want to have
a bit of a chat, you know?

50:02.520 --> 50:04.559
That wasn't Clay's phone.
We need a tower dump.

50:04.560 --> 50:07.439
The boss is a little bit worried
about how things are unfolding.

50:07.440 --> 50:10.559
Oh, mate, I gotta tell the NCC
something. They'll put me away.

50:10.560 --> 50:12.079
Yeah, well, that's why
I'm here, you know.

50:12.080 --> 50:13.240
Just talk things through.

50:13.241 --> 50:15.319
Options, choices, you
know, stuff like that.

50:15.320 --> 50:16.639
- Yeah.
- Sounds fair, yeah?

50:16.640 --> 50:17.879
Yeah.

50:17.880 --> 50:19.959
Listen, I was thinking I'd tell them

50:19.960 --> 50:21.439
Ollie and I cooked the whole thing up,

50:21.440 --> 50:22.879
that it was all our idea.

50:22.880 --> 50:24.399
Nah, I don't reckon they'll buy that.

50:24.400 --> 50:25.520
You know, I mean,

50:25.521 --> 50:27.479
they already know that there's
people higher up the chain.

50:27.480 --> 50:29.239
Yeah, yeah. Well, I mean, I
won't mention any names.

50:29.240 --> 50:31.360
Yeah, but, you know, how
can we be sure about that?

50:33.280 --> 50:35.000
Because I'm telling you.

50:36.480 --> 50:38.479
No, there's millions
involved here, mate.

50:38.480 --> 50:40.199
You know, for that kind of money,

50:40.200 --> 50:42.439
people want, you know,
absolute certainty.

50:42.440 --> 50:43.600
Okay.

50:43.601 --> 50:46.159
So what, do... Do you want me
to go missing or something?

50:46.160 --> 50:47.599
I'll be on the next plane out of here.

50:47.600 --> 50:49.959
Oh, Clay, how can you go missing?
I mean, you're Clay bloody Nelson.

50:49.960 --> 50:51.719
Okay, yeah, so what? You
tell me what the answer is.

50:51.720 --> 50:53.439
'Cause I'm telling you I'm
not going to tell anyone.

50:53.440 --> 50:55.079
You gotta trust me, though, right?

50:55.080 --> 50:57.159
What's that face for? (LAUGHS)

50:57.160 --> 50:59.239
What are you going to do? Kill me?

50:59.240 --> 51:00.839
No. No, mate, I'm not gonna kill ya.

51:00.840 --> 51:02.079
I mean, the last thing we want's

51:02.080 --> 51:03.959
a murder investigation on our hands.

51:03.960 --> 51:05.560
Who needs that kind of hassle?

51:06.680 --> 51:10.919
But, Clay, you've been under
a lot of pressure lately.

51:10.920 --> 51:12.919
I mean, all that guilt over Oliver,

51:12.920 --> 51:15.880
it must be really eating you up, mate.

51:18.920 --> 51:21.080
I'm sure everyone would understand if...

51:22.880 --> 51:24.560
it all got too much.

51:26.000 --> 51:29.159
- You've gotta be fuckin' kidding me.
- It can look like an accident.

51:29.160 --> 51:30.959
You didn't mean to take too many.

51:30.960 --> 51:33.679
You just wanted everything
to stop for a little while.

51:33.680 --> 51:36.439
No mess. Cleaner for everyone.

51:36.440 --> 51:37.920
No, mate.

51:39.160 --> 51:40.800
I'm not doing that.

51:42.800 --> 51:44.759
Actually, fuck it. I'll tell
them everything, you know.

51:44.760 --> 51:47.399
I'll bring you... I'll bring
you all down with me...

51:47.400 --> 51:48.600
Careful, Clay.

51:49.680 --> 51:51.639
If you do that, mate,

51:51.640 --> 51:53.240
we're gonna kill your son.

51:56.120 --> 51:58.360
His school looks really nice, Clay.

52:01.240 --> 52:04.400
How dare you threaten me with that.

52:05.480 --> 52:08.759
- How dare you...
- That's your choice, Clay.

52:08.760 --> 52:10.879
- And it's all you got.
- Like hell it is!

52:10.880 --> 52:13.359
You come in here and fuckin' walk on me!

52:13.360 --> 52:14.759
Get out.

52:14.760 --> 52:17.320
Get the fuck outta here,
you fuckin' gorilla!

52:28.000 --> 52:29.639
Clay,

52:29.640 --> 52:32.599
we need absolute certainty.

52:32.600 --> 52:35.280
With this much at stake,
mate, it's the only option.

52:42.400 --> 52:45.640
So, the only real question you
gotta ask yourself is this.

52:47.560 --> 52:49.120
Who do you love more?

52:50.520 --> 52:52.000
Yourself...

52:53.520 --> 52:55.080
or your son?

53:10.920 --> 53:12.400
(DOOR CLOSES)

53:13.400 --> 53:15.080
That look he gave me.

53:17.240 --> 53:19.360
He was telling me it was murder.

Synced and corrected by PetaG & Dragoniod

53:32.040 --> 53:34.359
You tell Janet I know
exactly what this is about,

53:34.360 --> 53:36.239
and if this is the way
she wants to play it,

53:36.240 --> 53:37.639
let the games begin.

53:37.640 --> 53:38.919
I'm not getting locked up!

53:38.920 --> 53:40.879
Now, I'm instructing you to get me off.

53:40.880 --> 53:43.399
- That was my brother's!
- You psycho bitch!

53:43.400 --> 53:46.359
I take it you've got Nate in your
sights for match fixing too.

53:46.360 --> 53:47.919
And it's your job to have
nothing to do with him.

53:47.920 --> 53:49.679
Your ethical wall just
came crashing down.

53:49.680 --> 53:51.079
What was I meant to do?!

53:51.080 --> 53:52.879
