WEBVTT

00:25.901 --> 00:28.195
-Action.
-Design.

01:08.026 --> 01:10.320
- Another one?

01:10.320 --> 01:14.324
Well, I'm still vertical,
so I'd like to change that.

01:23.333 --> 01:25.585
Ho, ho.

01:27.087 --> 01:29.339
Bitter. Pint.

01:30.340 --> 01:32.134
You just get off?

01:37.222 --> 01:39.141
I'm taking a break.

01:39.141 --> 01:41.310
Between shifts,
I guess you could say.

01:41.310 --> 01:42.894
- Hmm.
- You ain't driving, are you?

01:42.894 --> 01:45.939
I steer a little, but the
reindeer do most of the work.

01:48.859 --> 01:50.277
Mm-hmm.

01:50.277 --> 01:52.487
This is my, uh,
fourth year as a Santa.

01:52.487 --> 01:53.780
Ah.

01:53.780 --> 01:55.032
How about you?

01:55.032 --> 01:57.117
Lost count.

01:57.117 --> 02:00.287
I forget why I started doing it
in the first place.

02:00.287 --> 02:03.582
Same reason anybody
does anything.

02:03.582 --> 02:05.375
The money.

02:05.375 --> 02:08.045
Money. Money.

02:08.045 --> 02:10.047
This whole planet runs on greed.

02:14.718 --> 02:17.179
It's the look on
the kiddies' faces, innit?

02:17.179 --> 02:18.805
That's what does it for me.

02:18.805 --> 02:22.476
- Ah, the look. Yeah, that look.

02:22.476 --> 02:24.686
Lasts about two seconds.

02:24.686 --> 02:27.105
As soon as they're finished
unwrapping,

02:27.105 --> 02:29.566
they want the next present,

02:29.566 --> 02:32.319
they want the next cool thing.

02:32.319 --> 02:34.321
That's how this world works.

02:34.321 --> 02:36.365
And kids--
what kids have become.

02:36.365 --> 02:40.535
They're just like
little junkies.

02:40.535 --> 02:43.205
They're little shits.
They just demand.

02:43.205 --> 02:44.748
They don't believe.

02:44.748 --> 02:48.460
They just want, crave, consume.

02:53.465 --> 02:55.967
Maybe this is my last year.

02:58.053 --> 03:00.222
The last Christmas.

03:03.683 --> 03:07.312
Well, I can't stand seeing
another Santa in distress.

03:08.480 --> 03:10.107
Put his drinks on my tab.

03:10.107 --> 03:11.566
- Okay?
- Yeah.

03:11.566 --> 03:14.194
Oh, very merry of you. Okay.

03:14.194 --> 03:16.613
I better get going.

03:16.613 --> 03:18.824
Presents aren't gonna
deliver themselves.

03:19.991 --> 03:21.868
Oh, uh...

03:21.868 --> 03:23.745
For your grandson.
Save me a trip.

03:23.745 --> 03:25.789
It's, uh, that new video game.

03:25.789 --> 03:28.500
It's Astro Blaster,
Blaster Astro.

03:28.500 --> 03:30.502
I-I don't know.

03:30.502 --> 03:31.878
Merry Christmas.

03:31.878 --> 03:34.381
How'd he know
my grandson's name?

03:34.381 --> 03:37.592
- How'd he know I have
a grandson? -

03:37.592 --> 03:41.888
Oi! That door leads to the roof.

03:41.888 --> 03:43.223
Piss head.

03:43.223 --> 03:45.767
Go easy on him. It's Christmas.

03:47.936 --> 03:51.314
Hey! You can't be up here.

03:51.314 --> 03:54.985
If you break your neck,
I'm the one...

04:14.838 --> 04:17.257
My God.

04:22.262 --> 04:24.097
It's...

04:26.141 --> 04:27.601
...beauti...

05:14.439 --> 05:16.650
Hi. Hi, hi, hi.

05:16.650 --> 05:18.985
There she is. Hello, muffin.

05:20.028 --> 05:22.322
Let's go see Grandma.

05:24.074 --> 05:25.492
Ooh.

05:25.492 --> 05:27.744
Merry Christmas.

05:30.080 --> 05:31.665
Merry Christmas, Trudy.

05:31.665 --> 05:32.749
Merry...

05:32.749 --> 05:34.501
Mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah, mwah!

05:34.501 --> 05:37.921
Merry Christmas, Daddy,
ya filthy animal.

05:39.339 --> 05:41.508
She got to stay up late
and watch Home Alone.

05:41.508 --> 05:42.592
Uh-huh.

05:42.592 --> 05:45.512
It was so funny.

05:45.512 --> 05:47.973
- Yep.
- That... that hurts.

05:47.973 --> 05:49.516
- All morning.
- Okay, um...

05:49.516 --> 05:51.560
Thank you.

05:52.477 --> 05:54.479
For doing this.

05:54.479 --> 05:56.690
I'm not doing it for you.

05:58.358 --> 06:00.485
- It's Christmas!
- Yeah!

06:19.713 --> 06:21.381
Merry Christmas, Al.

06:21.381 --> 06:23.216
Hi, Linda. Merry Christmas.

06:23.216 --> 06:25.260
- Mr. Lightstone.
- Hey, Al.

06:25.260 --> 06:26.636
Hey, you back there, Tru?

06:26.636 --> 06:28.388
Yeah, I bet you're excited
for Christmas.

06:28.388 --> 06:30.098
What did you ask Santa for?

06:30.098 --> 06:31.850
- Not to work on Christmas Eve.

06:31.850 --> 06:33.435
Must've been naughty this year,

06:33.435 --> 06:35.061
-'cause here I am.
- Mm-hmm.

06:35.061 --> 06:37.063
Just make sure you let Santa
through the gates later, Al.

06:37.063 --> 06:38.607
- Yeah.
- Have a merry one, now.

06:38.607 --> 06:40.609
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas, Al.

06:40.609 --> 06:42.652
Merry Christmas, Tru.

06:42.652 --> 06:44.195
-Thank you, Al.
- Yeah.

07:07.010 --> 07:09.763
I can't remember
where the second one is.

07:12.807 --> 07:14.934
Ho, ho, ho, ho.

07:14.934 --> 07:16.686
Merry Christmas.

07:16.686 --> 07:18.772
Hope you're on the nice list.

07:18.772 --> 07:21.524
That doesn't go over there.

07:29.282 --> 07:30.909
Excuse me.

07:35.121 --> 07:36.956
What the hell is this?

07:36.956 --> 07:39.334
You are the worst
catering company on the planet.

07:39.334 --> 07:41.336
It's lengthwise, not width.

07:41.336 --> 07:43.213
Unbelievable.

07:59.646 --> 08:00.814
Okay.

08:00.814 --> 08:03.024
Hi. Hi, guys. Merry Christmas.

08:03.024 --> 08:04.984
- Hi.
- I'm fine. Thank you so much.

08:07.570 --> 08:11.574
I'll never get over the fact
that you grew up like this.

08:12.701 --> 08:15.161
My therapist says
I'll never get over it, either.

08:16.162 --> 08:17.372
I need a drink.

08:21.918 --> 08:25.171
- Hey, look at that.

08:34.139 --> 08:35.932
Hi, Linda.

08:35.932 --> 08:37.976
- Hey.
- How's it going, Alva?

08:37.976 --> 08:39.894
Mm-hmm. You gained weight.

08:39.894 --> 08:42.772
- Looks good on you, though.

08:42.772 --> 08:44.691
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

08:44.691 --> 08:46.401
'Sup, limp dick?

08:47.861 --> 08:49.529
I got great feelings
about this Christmas.

08:49.529 --> 08:51.698
- You want to know why?
- Yeah.

08:51.698 --> 08:53.700
'Cause I think this is the year

08:53.700 --> 08:55.493
that Mom's gonna
kick herself upstairs

08:55.493 --> 08:58.204
and choose one of us
to start running the show.

08:58.204 --> 09:02.709
And I got to tell you, Jason,
that I'm gunning for your ass.

09:04.127 --> 09:05.920
What would a Lightstone
family Christmas be

09:05.920 --> 09:07.714
without groveling
and infighting?

09:09.048 --> 09:10.759
Your rosé, ma'am.

09:10.759 --> 09:13.511
Honey, smile. It's Christmas.

09:13.511 --> 09:14.637
Mm.

09:14.637 --> 09:16.222
Good. Good girl.

09:18.600 --> 09:21.728
I am sorry about my sister.

09:27.108 --> 09:29.569
It is really nice to see you.

09:31.404 --> 09:33.698
To have you here.

09:36.951 --> 09:40.413
Okay, I'm behind. Catch me up
on all the hot goss.

09:40.413 --> 09:42.248
Hot goss. Okay.

09:42.248 --> 09:46.044
Um, well, you remember Bert,
my sister's pride and joy.

09:46.044 --> 09:49.881
Yo, yo, yo.
This is the Bert Locker

09:49.881 --> 09:53.760
living that bling life
on Christmas Eve.

09:55.345 --> 09:56.763
Hashtag "blessed."

09:56.763 --> 09:59.307
He just got
what I can only assume

09:59.307 --> 10:02.602
will be his first of many
sexual harassment accusations.

10:02.602 --> 10:04.270
Mom paid off the school,

10:04.270 --> 10:06.439
and now the gymnasium
is named after us.

10:06.439 --> 10:08.441
Of course she did.

10:08.441 --> 10:09.567
What about Tragic Mike?

10:09.567 --> 10:11.361
All I'm saying is,

10:11.361 --> 10:13.029
if I was on one of those planes,

10:13.029 --> 10:15.031
9/11 would've ended
with a bunch of terrorists

10:15.031 --> 10:18.785
skydiving over Connecticut
without their parachutes.

10:18.785 --> 10:20.829
-Yeah. You like that?
- Yes. Yes.

10:20.829 --> 10:23.039
- Yeah, I do like it.
- Ooh.

10:23.039 --> 10:25.458
- Kiss me in front of my son.
- Now, huh?

10:25.458 --> 10:28.002
- Mm...

10:28.002 --> 10:30.046
He might actually be
a decent actor.

10:30.046 --> 10:32.131
- Hmm. -He's been doing
an Oscar-worthy job

10:32.131 --> 10:34.717
- of pretending to find
my sister appealing. -

10:34.717 --> 10:37.220
Now he wants Mom
to fund a film for him.

10:40.139 --> 10:42.141
- It's Gertrude!
- It's Mom.

10:42.141 --> 10:44.185
- Okay, let's do this.
- Okay, okay. Come on.

10:44.185 --> 10:45.895
- Come on. Bert, get over here.
- No. Mom. Mom!

10:45.895 --> 10:47.146
- Positions.
- Game time, buddy.

10:47.146 --> 10:48.982
- Okay. Okay.
- This is my good side.

10:48.982 --> 10:50.775
We've gone over this! Come on!

10:50.775 --> 10:51.901
Gosh. Okay.

10:51.901 --> 10:53.069
Bert, get in the middle.

10:53.069 --> 10:54.320
So it begins.

10:54.320 --> 10:56.447
Seriously, come.
You know what that means.

10:56.447 --> 10:58.533
Shall we jockey forward?

10:58.533 --> 11:00.285
No.

11:01.452 --> 11:04.038
No, we can hang back.

11:04.038 --> 11:05.498
Yeah.

11:05.498 --> 11:07.125
Trudy, honey?

11:08.835 --> 11:10.086
Come on over here.

11:11.546 --> 11:13.715
Just, like...

11:13.715 --> 11:15.508
Threaten 'em or bribe 'em.

11:15.508 --> 11:16.801
This isn't rocket science.

11:16.801 --> 11:18.344
Same shit we always do.

11:19.846 --> 11:21.180
That's what?

11:21.180 --> 11:23.641
That's the best you can do?

11:23.641 --> 11:25.518
Excited to see your grandma?

11:25.518 --> 11:26.853
Listen, you cocksucker.

11:26.853 --> 11:28.813
It's Christmas,
so why don't you take

11:28.813 --> 11:30.732
your best offer, gift wrap it,

11:30.732 --> 11:33.693
and ram it up your fucking box.

11:35.028 --> 11:37.363
Maybe you don't
realize who I am.

11:37.363 --> 11:38.948
Those were Grandma words.
You know, forget them.

11:38.948 --> 11:40.783
Oh, boy.
Look at Mr. Cool back here.

11:40.783 --> 11:43.036
Yeah, what's your angle, man?
Hmm?

11:43.036 --> 11:45.663
No angle.
I'm not doing anything.

11:45.663 --> 11:47.123
Oh, yeah.

11:47.123 --> 11:48.708
No, no, no.
No, no, no, no, no. No!

11:48.708 --> 11:51.753
Don't shit in my mouth
and tell me it's chocolate cake.

11:51.753 --> 11:53.046
Grandma's cool.

11:53.046 --> 11:55.340
I can make that story go away...

11:55.340 --> 11:57.050
I think your brother's
up to something.

11:57.050 --> 11:58.843
No, I just decided
to let you guys

11:58.843 --> 12:00.720
have all the fun
sucking up to Mom today.

12:00.720 --> 12:03.514
Please. You are King Suck-up.

12:03.514 --> 12:05.558
You named your kid Gertrude.

12:06.935 --> 12:09.228
Alva, you named
your son Bertrude.

12:09.228 --> 12:11.230
Okay.

12:11.230 --> 12:12.941
Sorry, Bert,
but that's not a real name.

12:12.941 --> 12:15.777
Sorry, Linda. We can't all be
lucky enough to have daughters.

12:15.777 --> 12:17.779
Mom, I can hear you.

12:18.905 --> 12:21.491
You know something we don't.
What is it?

12:21.491 --> 12:22.951
No, I don't. I don't.

12:22.951 --> 12:24.202
I got it. Bingo.

12:24.202 --> 12:25.620
I'm onto you, man. Come on!

12:25.620 --> 12:27.246
- We were just...
- Come on,

12:27.246 --> 12:28.498
come on, come on, come on.

12:28.498 --> 12:30.792
- You big sack of shit.
- Ooh.

12:30.792 --> 12:32.627
No wonder your husband left you.

12:32.627 --> 12:34.879
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

12:35.922 --> 12:38.257
Merry Christmas to you, too,
Senator.

12:39.092 --> 12:40.885
- Merry Christmas, Mommy.
- Merry Christmas.

12:42.220 --> 12:43.763
Merry Christmas.

12:43.763 --> 12:46.516
Why in the hell are you standing
all the way back there?

12:47.600 --> 12:49.352
Merry Christmas, Grandma!

12:49.352 --> 12:51.437
- Aw.
- Little bitch.

12:51.437 --> 12:53.982
Little Gertrude. And how is
my favorite granddaughter?

12:53.982 --> 12:56.526
Everybody calls me Trudy now.

12:56.526 --> 12:58.194
Trudy?

12:59.529 --> 13:01.656
- Well, that makes her
sound like a whore. -Okay.

13:01.656 --> 13:04.409
Oh, she doesn't even know
the meaning of the word.

13:04.409 --> 13:06.744
I'm starving. Let's eat.

13:06.744 --> 13:08.204
Great.

13:08.204 --> 13:10.707
And, Mom, I think Gertrude
is a beautiful name.

13:10.707 --> 13:13.001
Mm-hmm.
I only call her Gertrude.

13:13.001 --> 13:14.293
- Merry Christmas, Gertrude.
- Come on, Bertrude.

14:19.192 --> 14:22.028
Another fucking Christmas.

14:25.364 --> 14:27.116
I made these all by myself.

14:27.116 --> 14:28.701
- No way.
- Mm-hmm.

14:28.701 --> 14:30.870
I even made one
that looks exactly like Santa.

14:30.870 --> 14:33.372
- Exactly.
- Yeah.

14:34.207 --> 14:35.750
Santa gets a candy cane, too?

14:35.750 --> 14:37.001
Yeah.

14:37.001 --> 14:38.503
Mm, okay.

14:39.879 --> 14:41.547
It's perfect.

14:41.547 --> 14:43.216
No peeking.

14:43.216 --> 14:45.676
This house has so many chimneys.

14:47.178 --> 14:49.222
How will Santa know
which one to come down?

14:49.222 --> 14:51.099
Oh, Santa just knows.

14:51.099 --> 14:52.892
Christmas magic.

14:55.853 --> 14:57.563
Honey, what's wrong?

14:57.563 --> 15:01.067
Daddy never took me to see
Santa at the mall this year.

15:01.859 --> 15:04.070
He didn't.

15:06.447 --> 15:08.449
I am so sorry.

15:10.243 --> 15:12.203
This year has been weird.

15:12.203 --> 15:15.915
I never got to tell Santa
what I wanted for Christmas.

15:15.915 --> 15:18.417
Oh, honey. Come here.

15:22.088 --> 15:24.715
You know what?

15:24.715 --> 15:28.928
You go put your pj's on,

15:28.928 --> 15:32.014
and I will be two minutes.

15:37.812 --> 15:40.106
Yes!

15:41.566 --> 15:43.985
Okay...

15:51.909 --> 15:53.619
Yes.

15:57.456 --> 15:59.292
Yes!

16:00.751 --> 16:05.173
Because you have been so good
to me and Mommy this year,

16:05.173 --> 16:09.135
we decided that
you could have one gift...

16:09.135 --> 16:11.012
early!

16:11.012 --> 16:13.472
- Really?

16:17.518 --> 16:19.604
What is it?

16:21.522 --> 16:25.109
That is a very special
walkie-talkie.

16:25.109 --> 16:26.652
It's magic.

16:26.652 --> 16:27.945
- Magic?
- Mm-hmm.

16:27.945 --> 16:30.156
What you got right there

16:30.156 --> 16:32.533
is a direct hotline
to Santa Claus himself.

16:32.533 --> 16:35.286
- I can talk to Santa?
- Oh, yeah.

16:35.286 --> 16:39.123
It's just like writing him
a letter... but better.

16:39.123 --> 16:40.249
Mm-hmm.

16:40.249 --> 16:43.044
Now, the only thing is,

16:43.044 --> 16:45.421
he might not have time
to answer you.

16:45.421 --> 16:47.465
He's delivering a lot
of presents tonight.

16:47.465 --> 16:48.799
Mm-hmm.

16:48.799 --> 16:51.385
But he'll hear everything
you want to say to him.

16:57.850 --> 16:59.685
Hello, Santa?

16:59.685 --> 17:03.147
This is Trudy Lightstone.

17:03.147 --> 17:05.191
I hope you're having
a nice night.

17:05.191 --> 17:07.360
Mm.

17:07.360 --> 17:12.114
It's really cold tonight,
so don't forget your mittens.

17:12.949 --> 17:16.244
So, I wanted to tell you, Santa,

17:16.244 --> 17:18.037
I was extra good this year,

17:18.037 --> 17:22.208
so I wrote a big list for you
with all the stuff I wanted.

17:23.542 --> 17:25.419
But then...

17:25.419 --> 17:28.839
then I realized
I don't need any of that.

17:29.757 --> 17:33.469
I really only want
one present for Christmas.

17:35.137 --> 17:38.808
I want Mommy and Daddy
to make up

17:38.808 --> 17:41.227
so we can be a family again.

17:42.436 --> 17:44.105
Okay.

17:44.105 --> 17:46.274
Good night, Santa.

17:47.441 --> 17:49.568
Good night, Mr. Bunny.

18:01.998 --> 18:03.749
Which one of you did that?

18:05.084 --> 18:06.419
You can't go two seconds without

18:06.419 --> 18:08.254
crapping on the roof
like a bunch of pigeons?

18:09.964 --> 18:13.092
So unprofessional.

18:15.678 --> 18:18.389
You know, Rudolph
will never do this crap.

18:31.610 --> 18:33.279
Hmm.

18:37.575 --> 18:39.368
Mmm.

18:46.042 --> 18:48.294
Mmm, mmm.

18:49.295 --> 18:51.630
Homemade.

18:51.630 --> 18:53.007
Mmm.

18:56.844 --> 18:58.846
Ugh.

18:58.846 --> 19:00.431
Skim.

19:10.691 --> 19:12.276
Oh, yeah.

19:12.276 --> 19:14.403
That's the stuff.

19:18.824 --> 19:20.743
Mmm.

19:21.744 --> 19:23.496
DuBoi...

19:23.496 --> 19:26.499
- On some prewar shit
right there. -

19:26.499 --> 19:28.918
- Good shit.

19:40.513 --> 19:42.181
Mmm.

19:42.181 --> 19:43.849
That pairs well.

19:43.849 --> 19:46.519
What do we have here?

20:02.743 --> 20:04.453
Oh, yeah.

20:04.453 --> 20:06.539
That's the stuff.

20:15.464 --> 20:18.551
- You know, uh...

20:18.551 --> 20:21.554
Christmas is all right,

20:21.554 --> 20:25.224
but you Americans don't
celebrate my favorite holiday.

20:26.058 --> 20:27.893
Oh, yeah? What?

20:27.893 --> 20:29.520
Boxing Day.

21:02.761 --> 21:04.430
Yo, yo. B. Lightstone here,

21:04.430 --> 21:06.223
live streaming the dream,
you know.

21:06.223 --> 21:08.767
They say the richest man...

21:09.935 --> 21:11.562
Say goodbye.

21:11.562 --> 21:13.522
And if you...

21:14.690 --> 21:17.693
Grandma! Your Wi-Fi sucks dick.

21:17.693 --> 21:19.361
Damn it!

21:19.361 --> 21:21.947
When he was small,
I begged you to beat him.

21:39.423 --> 21:41.425
Hey. Merry Christmas.

21:41.425 --> 21:43.093
Or should I say
"happy holidays" now?

21:43.093 --> 21:45.137
Right? I mean, it's like,
people, make up your minds.

21:45.137 --> 21:47.389
- You know what I'm saying?
- Can I help you?

21:47.389 --> 21:49.350
Oh, yeah. I sure hope so.
See, uh,

21:49.350 --> 21:50.976
my car broke down
a little ways...

21:50.976 --> 21:52.811
Out here?
This is a private road.

21:52.811 --> 21:54.813
You're telling me.

21:54.813 --> 21:57.107
It's the first place
I've seen for miles.

21:57.107 --> 21:58.400
I think I got frostbite.

21:58.400 --> 21:59.735
Where the hell am I, anyway?

21:59.735 --> 22:01.487
G.T. Lightstone family compound.

22:01.487 --> 22:03.322
I'll call you a tow.

22:12.373 --> 22:14.375
All right, revelers.

22:14.375 --> 22:16.168
Time to steal Christmas.

22:16.168 --> 22:17.419
Sound off.

22:17.419 --> 22:19.004
Jingle. Check.

22:19.004 --> 22:20.589
Peppermint. Check.

22:20.589 --> 22:22.174
Sugarplum. Check.

22:22.174 --> 22:25.135
Krampus. Ready to fuck shit up.

22:25.135 --> 22:26.929
Candy Cane. Check.

22:26.929 --> 22:29.557
- Go for Frosty.
- Go for Tinsel.

22:29.557 --> 22:31.267
Go for Gingerbread.

22:31.267 --> 22:34.228
Are we gonna use these stupid
code names all night?

22:34.228 --> 22:35.729
'Tis the season.

22:35.729 --> 22:39.525
Welcome to your worst
Christmas ever.

22:39.525 --> 22:42.903
Trudy loves seeing Santa
at the mall.

22:43.737 --> 22:45.531
She loves going with her father.

22:45.531 --> 22:47.199
And you should've
taken her yesterday,

22:47.199 --> 22:48.576
like you do every Christmas,

22:48.576 --> 22:50.286
but we didn't even
hear from you.

22:50.286 --> 22:51.620
Mom put me on a special project.

22:51.620 --> 22:53.038
- It's complicated.
- But it's not,

22:53.038 --> 22:55.124
because it keeps happening
over and over.

22:55.124 --> 22:57.710
- Your mother forcing herself
between us. -You're right.

23:02.298 --> 23:04.675
What if we could give Trudy
her Christmas wish?

23:04.675 --> 23:06.760
You're trying to win me back

23:06.760 --> 23:09.430
with a romantic weekend
at your mother's?

23:09.430 --> 23:12.766
What if things
really changed this time?

23:14.518 --> 23:16.979
We got out from under
my mother's thumb.

23:16.979 --> 23:18.772
We'll walk away.

23:18.772 --> 23:21.483
From the company, the family.

23:24.194 --> 23:25.821
Tonight.

23:26.614 --> 23:28.157
What are you up to?

24:13.452 --> 24:14.745
Let's go.

24:14.745 --> 24:17.247
We need to get you out of here.

24:17.247 --> 24:18.999
Mommy, where are you going?

24:18.999 --> 24:20.793
- She's going for the panic room!
- What?

24:20.793 --> 24:22.127
- Yes. Go, Bertrude.
- Without us?

24:28.092 --> 24:30.135
Fuck, fuck, fuck,
fuck, fuck, fuck.

24:51.824 --> 24:53.784
There isn't room for all of us.

24:53.784 --> 24:55.536
She can fit at least two of us.
Mom, take me.

24:55.536 --> 24:57.496
- Mom!
- Oh. Yeah.

24:57.496 --> 24:59.123
M-Mom, can Bert come, too?

25:01.792 --> 25:03.043
Okay. Move it or lose it, son.

25:03.043 --> 25:04.753
- Move it!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

25:04.753 --> 25:06.880
You're supposed to protect us.

25:06.880 --> 25:08.549
We protect the primary asset.

25:12.511 --> 25:13.721
Who the hell are you?

25:13.721 --> 25:16.682
You can call me Mr. Scrooge.

25:17.433 --> 25:18.851
Hilarious.

25:18.851 --> 25:20.185
Get him.

25:28.736 --> 25:31.155
Bah humbug, motherfucker.

25:40.539 --> 25:42.791
Hey. Step aside.

25:44.042 --> 25:46.545
Tinsel, Peppermint,
sweep upstairs.

25:46.545 --> 25:48.756
I want all the Lightstones
together.

25:49.548 --> 25:51.258
Kill anybody else you find.

26:01.435 --> 26:04.229
Fuck. Fuck, fuck.

26:05.063 --> 26:07.608
Trudy, honey, we got to go.

26:08.567 --> 26:10.110
Wake up, honey. Wake up.

26:10.110 --> 26:12.905
Maybe we can get out the back
by the servants' stairs.

26:19.745 --> 26:22.247
Oh, come on. Not now. Not now.

26:23.373 --> 26:25.375
Fuck! Fuck!

26:25.375 --> 26:26.919
Mistletoe, gingerbread.

26:51.109 --> 26:52.194
Hey!

26:55.030 --> 26:56.281
Oh. Oh.

26:56.281 --> 26:57.741
Hi.

26:57.741 --> 27:00.202
You got me.

27:00.202 --> 27:02.788
I don't want any trouble, okay?

27:02.788 --> 27:04.498
Downstairs. Now.

27:04.498 --> 27:08.168
Look, mister,
I don't want to get involved.

27:08.168 --> 27:10.587
I just...
I just have a job to do.

27:10.587 --> 27:11.964
Okay? That's it.

27:11.964 --> 27:14.466
I'm just gonna take my bag,

27:14.466 --> 27:17.302
and I'm just gonna
scooch up that chimney.

27:18.804 --> 27:20.681
Enough talk. Let's go.

27:21.473 --> 27:23.225
You don't want to do this.

27:23.225 --> 27:24.434
What? This?

27:26.144 --> 27:27.479
Now, move!

27:27.479 --> 27:29.481
- Are you deaf?

27:29.481 --> 27:31.483
Fucking move!

27:42.286 --> 27:44.162
No, no, no.

27:44.162 --> 27:47.332
No! Wait!

27:47.332 --> 27:48.667
Wait.

27:48.667 --> 27:50.335
Wait! Don't go!

27:50.335 --> 27:52.212
Come back!

29:07.287 --> 29:09.039
Oh, fuck!

29:33.146 --> 29:34.648
Oh, shit.

29:55.961 --> 29:59.798
Damn chickenshit reindeer
leave me here to die.

30:21.778 --> 30:23.155
Cute.

30:23.155 --> 30:26.283
Do you have any idea
who you're fucking with?

30:29.619 --> 30:32.497
I know exactly
who I'm fucking with.

30:32.497 --> 30:34.624
Oh, wait, wait.
Did you actually think

30:34.624 --> 30:36.168
that I spent months

30:36.168 --> 30:38.837
planning a complex break-in
to the most secure

30:38.837 --> 30:40.464
private residence in the country

30:40.464 --> 30:42.215
and I didn't know
who lived here?

30:42.215 --> 30:43.800
Well, you're wrong.

30:43.800 --> 30:46.762
'Cause your staff are dead.

30:46.762 --> 30:48.889
- Your security are dead.

30:48.889 --> 30:52.184
Now, sit down
and shut the fuck up!

31:20.295 --> 31:22.339
Oh, fuck.

31:25.217 --> 31:26.551
We planned it. It's all right.

31:26.551 --> 31:28.178
It'll be solved
in a couple minutes.

31:28.178 --> 31:29.721
Better be solved.

31:29.721 --> 31:32.099
So much like a scene
from my movie Dark Ransom.

31:32.099 --> 31:33.558
Oh, my God.

31:34.726 --> 31:36.228
If they didn't have guns,

31:36.228 --> 31:38.271
I could take out three,
maybe four of them.

31:38.271 --> 31:40.398
Try all of them.

31:40.398 --> 31:43.026
Ew, Mom. Yuck.

31:43.026 --> 31:44.820
If you'd really done
your research, you'd know

31:44.820 --> 31:47.614
that my brother Rory
was kidnapped in the '70s.

31:48.490 --> 31:51.118
But my father
never called the police.

31:51.118 --> 31:53.620
Dad sent in our own
private extraction team,

31:53.620 --> 31:57.207
and Rory was home
safe and sound a week later.

31:57.207 --> 32:00.877
And the kidnappers
were never found.

32:00.877 --> 32:02.963
If you get me.

32:04.506 --> 32:06.007
I know.

32:06.007 --> 32:08.718
I know all about
your extraction team

32:08.718 --> 32:10.804
that you affectionately call
"the Kill Squad"

32:10.804 --> 32:12.597
behind closed doors.

32:12.597 --> 32:14.516
I also know
that they're on their way

32:14.516 --> 32:16.518
and how long it's gonna
take 'em to get here.

32:16.518 --> 32:19.437
I even know their credit ratings
and their dick sizes.

32:19.437 --> 32:21.106
If you get me.

32:21.106 --> 32:23.275
Then you should also know
you're already dead.

32:23.275 --> 32:25.110
We don't do ransoms.

32:25.110 --> 32:27.737
Again, I know. I know.

32:27.737 --> 32:29.739
See, I know a lot, Gertrude.

32:29.739 --> 32:31.491
I really do.

32:31.491 --> 32:34.578
Like the fact that you have
300 million in U.S. dollars

32:34.578 --> 32:36.705
sitting in your personal vault
downstairs.

32:36.705 --> 32:38.957
- The fuck?
- That's right.

32:38.957 --> 32:41.710
300 million that
the U.S. government

32:41.710 --> 32:45.172
gave Lightstone to quietly
distribute in the Middle East

32:45.172 --> 32:46.840
to all the worst people,

32:46.840 --> 32:51.011
to grease the wheels
and keep that sweet oil flowing.

32:51.011 --> 32:55.599
300 million that-- oops--
disappeared in the fog of war.

32:55.599 --> 32:58.810
Except it didn't really
disappear, did it, Gerty?

32:58.810 --> 33:00.145
'Cause you stole it.

33:00.145 --> 33:01.730
Did you know about this?

33:01.730 --> 33:03.190
Man, this family.

33:03.190 --> 33:06.359
This moneygrubbing family.

33:06.359 --> 33:08.236
Clinging desperately
to your wealth,

33:08.236 --> 33:10.655
when your poor employees
don't even have enough coal

33:10.655 --> 33:12.532
to keep Tiny Tim warm.

33:12.532 --> 33:15.702
What is it with you
and all this Christmas shit?

33:15.702 --> 33:17.495
Talk all you want.

33:17.495 --> 33:19.331
You'll never get in the vault.

33:19.331 --> 33:22.834
Oh, oh, oh, because when
you-you hit the panic button,

33:22.834 --> 33:24.502
it reset the combination?

33:24.502 --> 33:28.173
I keep telling you, I know.

33:32.969 --> 33:35.847
This is what breaking
into a vault has turned into?

33:35.847 --> 33:40.518
Remember when you just had to
drill holes and blow shit up?

33:40.518 --> 33:42.187
I don't know,
maybe I'm getting old,

33:42.187 --> 33:43.688
but there was something
romantic about that.

33:43.688 --> 33:45.941
Boss, you copy?

33:45.941 --> 33:47.901
I'm kind of busy here.

33:47.901 --> 33:50.362
You're gonna want to see this.

33:59.704 --> 34:01.373
Maybe he fell.

34:01.373 --> 34:02.791
You rappel down buildings
with him.

34:02.791 --> 34:05.210
You gonna tell me
he just fell out a window?

34:06.044 --> 34:08.046
All right, look lively, gang.

34:08.046 --> 34:09.798
We got a gopher.

34:25.230 --> 34:26.731
You know what?

34:26.731 --> 34:30.902
Um, I think Mr. Bunny
wants to go to sleep.

34:30.902 --> 34:32.904
So, let's tuck him in.

34:32.904 --> 34:34.531
Okay?

34:35.699 --> 34:37.409
It's gonna be okay.

34:51.298 --> 34:53.842
Hello? Santa?

34:53.842 --> 34:55.802
Are you there?

35:01.641 --> 35:03.393
Shit.

35:07.522 --> 35:10.150
This is
Candy Cane at checkpoint three.

35:10.150 --> 35:11.860
Oh, shit.

35:11.860 --> 35:13.653
Shit. Shit. Shit.

35:16.823 --> 35:18.742
Video game.

35:19.909 --> 35:21.244
Video game.

35:21.244 --> 35:23.455
Didn't anybody ask
for a bat or a sword

35:23.455 --> 35:26.583
- or Molotov cocktails?

35:35.091 --> 35:36.801
Wait.

35:51.566 --> 35:53.234
Mommy, I love you.

35:54.778 --> 35:56.654
Poetry book.

35:56.654 --> 35:59.115
Die Hard on Blu-ray. Fuck!

36:13.254 --> 36:15.215
Safety's on, dipshit.

36:26.017 --> 36:27.977
Wait. Hang on. Hang on.

36:29.354 --> 36:31.940
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait. Look.

36:31.940 --> 36:33.358
I don't want to kill you.

36:37.320 --> 36:41.116
Wow, a big fat guy, gray beard.

36:41.116 --> 36:43.201
Eh?

36:43.743 --> 36:45.787
Santa...

36:45.787 --> 36:47.831
I'm gonna rip
your fucking balls off.

37:01.302 --> 37:03.221
Oh, shit.

38:48.034 --> 38:50.370
Ah, God.

38:50.370 --> 38:52.080
Whew.

38:53.122 --> 38:56.084
Whew. Whew.

38:56.084 --> 38:58.169
This is Candy Cane checking in.

38:58.169 --> 38:59.879
Compound is clear and secured.

39:02.006 --> 39:04.092
Copy. What's the
status on the Kill Squad?

39:05.760 --> 39:07.512
Kill Squad
won't be here for two hours.

39:07.512 --> 39:10.390
So we're doing good. The outer
seal's already been breached.

39:10.390 --> 39:13.017
Is there a 911 thing on here?

39:13.017 --> 39:15.520
My...

39:15.520 --> 39:17.480
Am I doing that correct?

39:17.480 --> 39:18.815
Hello?

39:18.815 --> 39:20.775
Hello, can anybody hear me?

39:20.775 --> 39:23.361
Can you hear me, Santa?

39:25.196 --> 39:26.447
Hello?

39:26.447 --> 39:28.032
Santa?

39:31.202 --> 39:32.954
Yeah, this is Santa.

39:35.707 --> 39:38.376
I hope I'm not bothering you.

39:39.752 --> 39:42.630
Daddy said you were
very busy tonight.

39:44.382 --> 39:46.301
I'm...

39:46.301 --> 39:48.511
I'm on a break.

39:48.511 --> 39:50.722
Who-who am I speaking to?

39:53.141 --> 39:55.018
My name is Trudy Lightstone,

39:55.018 --> 39:58.479
and I've been very good
this year.

39:58.479 --> 40:00.398
Trudy...

40:02.609 --> 40:04.736
Trudy Lightstone.

40:13.578 --> 40:15.788
Yeah, Trudy.

40:15.788 --> 40:18.166
You're on my nice list.

40:18.166 --> 40:20.710
You've been a very good girl
this year.

40:22.253 --> 40:24.464
Where are you now, Trudy?

40:25.715 --> 40:28.551
I'm in a big room
with all my relatives.

40:28.551 --> 40:31.929
There's two bad men with guns
watching us.

40:34.515 --> 40:36.225
Oh, no. Six left.

40:36.225 --> 40:38.561
Are you gonna help us, Santa?

40:39.687 --> 40:41.689
Yeah. Of course
I'm gonna help you.

40:41.689 --> 40:44.400
I'm gonna...
I'm gonna get you out of there.

40:44.400 --> 40:47.987
Take all these bad guys
on my naughty list...

40:48.863 --> 40:51.366
I'm gonna take a lump of coal,

40:51.366 --> 40:55.328
each and every one of them,
and shove it straight up...

40:55.328 --> 40:56.621
The ass.

40:59.457 --> 41:01.000
Well, I mean, come on, sweetie.

41:01.000 --> 41:03.961
We want to keep you
on the nice list, you know.

41:05.296 --> 41:07.882
Sorry.
Can I say "butthole," then?

41:08.675 --> 41:10.176
I mean, it's borderline.

41:10.176 --> 41:11.803
How about "anus"?

41:11.803 --> 41:16.140
Technically, yes,
uh, "anus" is the tech...

41:16.140 --> 41:17.975
Okay, look, uh, Tru...
uh, Trudy.

41:17.975 --> 41:20.728
I got to call for help,
and the phone lines are down.

41:20.728 --> 41:23.398
You probably know this house
better than anybody.

41:23.398 --> 41:25.316
You got any suggestions?

41:25.316 --> 41:26.943
I have an idea.

41:29.195 --> 41:31.781
All right, you're telling me
there's a goddamn Santa Claus

41:31.781 --> 41:33.700
running around here?

41:36.869 --> 41:38.913
Okay, well,
he looks jolly as fuck,

41:38.913 --> 41:40.456
but who the hell is he?

41:40.456 --> 41:42.667
There's no Santa listed
on the employee manifest.

41:42.667 --> 41:44.001
Yeah, there's more.

41:44.001 --> 41:45.712
Frosty hasn't checked in.
I can't reach him.

41:45.712 --> 41:47.672
All right, keep trying.

41:50.341 --> 41:51.884
All right, it's official.

41:51.884 --> 41:53.803
We got a gopher on the loose,
and he's dangerous.

41:53.803 --> 41:55.221
Watch your backs.

42:00.184 --> 42:02.937
Al? Al?

42:09.152 --> 42:11.028
Oh, shit.

42:18.703 --> 42:20.371
Oh, shit!

42:20.371 --> 42:23.708
Frosty, what's your status?

42:27.170 --> 42:29.213
Frosty, sound off.

42:30.214 --> 42:33.092
Uh, Frosty?

42:34.385 --> 42:35.845
Is-is that, uh...

42:35.845 --> 42:37.764
is that the naughty guy
I met in the basement?

42:37.764 --> 42:39.474
Your-your friend is dead.

42:39.474 --> 42:42.727
Uh, he got a star in his face,
then his head caught on fire.

42:42.727 --> 42:44.645
It's a long story.

42:44.645 --> 42:47.482
Oh.

42:47.482 --> 42:49.650
Is this... is this our Santy?

42:49.650 --> 42:52.570
Is this our... our Santy Claus?

42:52.570 --> 42:54.155
Yeah, it is.

42:54.947 --> 42:56.866
To whom am I speaking?

42:56.866 --> 42:58.868
Well, for tonight,
I'm Mr. Scrooge.

42:58.868 --> 43:02.789
Now, what is it
that you want exactly, Santa?

43:02.789 --> 43:05.333
I want you to put down
your weapons,

43:05.333 --> 43:08.252
I want you to let
this family go,

43:08.252 --> 43:10.129
and then I want to find
my reindeer,

43:10.129 --> 43:12.632
and I want to continue
delivering my presents.

43:15.384 --> 43:16.928
Are you fucking with me?

43:16.928 --> 43:19.222
All right, who the hell
are you really, huh?

43:19.222 --> 43:21.849
Some security guard who's
watched too many action flicks?

43:21.849 --> 43:24.310
Some loser ex-cop
stuck in a mall

43:24.310 --> 43:26.562
playing dress-up with fat kids
pissing on your lap?

43:26.562 --> 43:27.980
Stop me when I get it right.

43:27.980 --> 43:30.274
It's a little more complicated
than that.

43:30.274 --> 43:31.901
Not to me, it's not.

43:31.901 --> 43:33.903
'Cause I want to make it
my personal mission,

43:33.903 --> 43:38.241
my holiday to-do list,
to find you and to end you

43:38.241 --> 43:41.911
and to wipe my ass with you
and this whole fucking holiday.

43:41.911 --> 43:44.455
That's what I want
for Christmas, Santa.

43:44.455 --> 43:48.584
That is a terrible thing
to want for Christmas.

43:48.584 --> 43:52.338
But maybe you and I should
discuss that in person.

43:53.631 --> 43:56.300
Santa Claus is coming to town.

44:07.687 --> 44:09.146
Shit.

44:18.990 --> 44:20.324
All right, who did you hire

44:20.324 --> 44:22.994
to play Santa at
your Christmas party, huh?

44:22.994 --> 44:25.037
- I said, who's playing Santa

44:25.037 --> 44:26.497
at your fucked-up
Christmas party?

44:26.497 --> 44:29.417
I didn't hire a Santa.

44:29.417 --> 44:32.378
I never have a Santa.
It's tacky.

44:32.378 --> 44:33.754
So, who is he?

44:36.591 --> 44:39.468
Huh? Who is he?

44:39.468 --> 44:41.012
Somebody better start talking,

44:41.012 --> 44:44.098
or I'm gonna bash
her brains in with this...

44:44.098 --> 44:48.686
Damn, Gertrude. You really got
a thing for nutcrackers, huh?

44:49.854 --> 44:53.733
So, I'm gonna torture
everyone in your family

44:53.733 --> 44:56.819
until you tell me who's
running around your mansion

44:56.819 --> 44:59.572
playing Santa
and fucking with my shit.

44:59.572 --> 45:01.574
And who should I pick first?

45:01.574 --> 45:02.992
Should I go by age?

45:02.992 --> 45:04.660
- Shh.

45:04.660 --> 45:06.329
Or should I go by IQ?

45:06.329 --> 45:09.790
Pick Jason.
He's my mom's favorite.

45:09.790 --> 45:11.834
- Yep. Him.
- The one in the sweater.

45:11.834 --> 45:14.211
All right.
Jason Lightstone it is.

45:14.211 --> 45:15.463
- The number one son.
- No.

45:15.463 --> 45:16.964
Wait, wait, wait.
No, we don't need...

45:16.964 --> 45:18.382
We don't need to do that.
No, it's okay.

45:18.382 --> 45:20.551
No. No, no, no.
We don't need to do this.

45:20.551 --> 45:21.761
No. No, no, no, no.

45:21.761 --> 45:23.262
Don't, don't, don't.

45:23.262 --> 45:25.556
- No, don't... Put it...
Don't... No. -

45:25.556 --> 45:27.767
- No, no, no, no. No, no.
- Give me this fucking...

45:36.776 --> 45:39.487
I'm telling you,
no one hired a Santa.

45:39.487 --> 45:41.113
All right, all right,
all right. You're right.

45:41.113 --> 45:42.156
You're right.
Let's stop it. Let's stop it.

45:42.156 --> 45:44.283
What are we doing here? Come on.

45:44.283 --> 45:47.370
What are we, amateurs?
We're half-assing this.

45:47.370 --> 45:50.498
Come on. It's not called
a finger cracker.

45:51.707 --> 45:53.668
Okay, Candy Cane.

45:53.668 --> 45:55.044
Stick one of his bozaks
in there.

45:55.044 --> 45:56.253
I'm not touching his balls.

45:56.253 --> 45:57.964
What, are you a princess
all of a sudden?

45:57.964 --> 45:59.590
I've seen you
scoop out brains before.

45:59.590 --> 46:01.050
You want me
to scoop his brains out,

46:01.050 --> 46:02.593
I'll scoop his brains out
right now,

46:02.593 --> 46:03.761
but I'm not touching his junk.

46:03.761 --> 46:05.179
I don't care who does it.

46:05.179 --> 46:06.764
I better be looking
at flat balls,

46:06.764 --> 46:08.015
like, in three seconds.

46:08.015 --> 46:10.601
I'll do it.

46:10.601 --> 46:11.894
Krampus. Perfect.

46:11.894 --> 46:13.270
Oh, not that guy. Not that guy.

46:13.270 --> 46:14.772
That's what I love
about sociopaths.

46:14.772 --> 46:16.065
Always up for trying new things.

46:16.065 --> 46:17.400
You don't need to do this, okay?

46:17.400 --> 46:19.318
No, it's all right.
Um... Oh, no.

46:19.318 --> 46:21.862
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

46:21.862 --> 46:24.407
Oh, God. Oh, my God.

46:25.950 --> 46:27.576
Put your nuts in.

46:27.576 --> 46:28.953
Yummy, yummy.

46:28.953 --> 46:31.706
Stop hurting my daddy...

46:31.706 --> 46:34.125
or Santa will get mad.

46:34.959 --> 46:37.169
Ah, what a cutie.

46:37.169 --> 46:39.255
So, what do we know
about Santa, little one?

46:39.255 --> 46:41.173
She doesn't know anything
about Santa.

46:42.049 --> 46:43.801
He wasn't asking you.

46:43.801 --> 46:46.220
She's playing make-believe.

46:46.220 --> 46:48.472
She's pretending
to talk to Santa.

46:48.472 --> 46:50.474
It's not pretend.
Santa's my friend,

46:50.474 --> 46:52.393
and he said
he's going to save us.

46:52.393 --> 46:53.477
No.

46:53.477 --> 46:55.730
- And beat you up.
- Oh, is he?

46:55.730 --> 46:58.274
I bet he'd come out of hiding
if you asked him to, huh?

46:58.274 --> 46:59.859
What do you say you come with me

46:59.859 --> 47:02.111
- and we play a little game
with him, huh? -No, no, no.

47:02.111 --> 47:03.487
Trudy, come on.
Tell him the truth now.

47:03.487 --> 47:05.322
- You aren't talking to Santa.
- Yes, I am.

47:05.322 --> 47:06.657
No, you're not. Come on, now.

47:06.657 --> 47:09.493
- Yes, I am. -Damn it, Trudy,
Santa isn't real!

47:17.710 --> 47:19.503
I'm sorry, honey.

47:20.463 --> 47:22.673
Santa's just a thing
adults tell kids

47:22.673 --> 47:24.884
to make them feel better, okay?

47:26.886 --> 47:29.013
Your mommy and I
give you the presents,

47:29.013 --> 47:31.015
and we say they're from Santa.

47:32.183 --> 47:33.768
He's not coming to save us.

47:33.768 --> 47:35.978
He doesn't exist.

47:35.978 --> 47:38.397
It's all made-up.

47:39.940 --> 47:41.734
- Really?
- Aw.

47:41.734 --> 47:44.570
What a way to find out
that there's no Santa.

47:44.570 --> 47:46.614
Hey, let's come back Easter
and ruin the Easter Bunny

47:46.614 --> 47:48.783
- for her, too, huh?

47:48.783 --> 47:50.201
- Trudy!
- Come back here!

47:50.201 --> 47:51.660
- Stop her!
- Trudy! -Hey!

47:51.660 --> 47:53.162
You idiots, stay at your posts.

47:53.162 --> 47:54.622
Trudy!

47:54.622 --> 47:56.957
I'll find this little brat.

49:03.065 --> 49:04.483
Okay.

49:33.095 --> 49:36.098
Santa. Santa.

49:36.098 --> 49:37.975
- Santa!

49:39.643 --> 49:41.478
This is Trudy.

49:42.313 --> 49:45.482
- Are you okay, Santa?

49:47.568 --> 49:48.986
Hi. Hey.

49:48.986 --> 49:50.821
Are you okay?

49:50.821 --> 49:52.656
I'm good. Uh...

49:52.656 --> 49:55.034
I was just wrapping
something up.

49:55.034 --> 49:57.244
I ran away and hid in the attic.

49:57.244 --> 50:00.497
Okay. If you're safe...

50:00.497 --> 50:03.500
uh, just stay there
and, uh, stay quiet, all right?

50:03.500 --> 50:08.339
Okay. I can set up booby traps,
like in Home Alone.

50:08.339 --> 50:10.007
Okay, I don't know
what that means,

50:10.007 --> 50:11.717
but, uh, yeah, do that.

50:11.717 --> 50:13.636
Just do it quietly.

50:15.012 --> 50:17.014
Are you really Santa?

50:20.851 --> 50:22.853
Of course I am, sweetheart.

50:23.729 --> 50:26.607
My daddy says
there isn't any Santa.

50:28.025 --> 50:31.237
He says parents just tell
their kids that Santa's real

50:31.237 --> 50:32.947
to make them feel better.

50:32.947 --> 50:35.824
He said they give us presents

50:35.824 --> 50:38.118
and say they're from Santa.

50:38.118 --> 50:40.246
Yeah.

50:40.246 --> 50:42.498
Yeah, a lot of parents say that.

50:42.498 --> 50:46.543
But I still bring presents
to kids that need me.

50:47.836 --> 50:50.130
Kids who really believe.

50:51.382 --> 50:54.301
How do you know
who really needs you?

50:54.301 --> 50:56.512
Christmas magic.

50:56.512 --> 50:58.806
I'm not really sure
how it works.

51:06.605 --> 51:08.899
But, uh...

51:11.068 --> 51:14.196
I remember, um...

51:14.196 --> 51:16.115
when Trudy Lightstone
wrote to me.

51:16.115 --> 51:18.534
She must have been
about six years old,

51:18.534 --> 51:22.371
and she said that
she felt lonely sometimes.

51:22.371 --> 51:24.790
She missed having a best friend.

51:24.790 --> 51:26.125
And so I brought her

51:26.125 --> 51:28.002
a beautiful little
stuffed rabbit.

51:28.002 --> 51:29.378
Mr. Bunny.

51:29.378 --> 51:31.338
And then I remember
the next year,

51:31.338 --> 51:33.465
and you said you had
this amazing dream

51:33.465 --> 51:37.511
and that, afterwards,
all you wanted to do was...

51:37.511 --> 51:38.762
To fly!

51:38.762 --> 51:41.181
To fly. To fly.

51:42.433 --> 51:46.895
I mean, Santa might have
some magic, but...

51:46.895 --> 51:50.607
making a little girl fly?

51:52.776 --> 51:56.864
But giving you a kite,

51:56.864 --> 52:00.326
floating just beneath
the clouds,

52:00.326 --> 52:03.162
well, it's about
as good as it gets.

52:03.162 --> 52:05.039
I knew it.

52:05.039 --> 52:07.416
I knew you were real, Santa.

52:09.960 --> 52:13.130
Don't be too hard
on your parents, all right?

52:14.882 --> 52:17.718
Grown-ups have a hard time
believing things.

52:18.552 --> 52:20.846
Can you use your Christmas magic

52:20.846 --> 52:23.182
to make them
love each other again?

52:23.182 --> 52:25.726
I wish I had that kind of power.

52:26.518 --> 52:30.272
Mrs. Claus and I have been
going on year, uh,

52:30.272 --> 52:32.566
1,100, and...

52:33.442 --> 52:36.278
Grown-up relationships
are complicated.

52:37.112 --> 52:39.323
It takes work.

52:39.323 --> 52:41.450
A lot of work.

52:43.577 --> 52:45.996
Do you still love her?

52:45.996 --> 52:47.831
Yeah, I do.

52:48.791 --> 52:52.336
And sometimes, even if you want
to make somebody happy...

52:53.545 --> 52:55.839
...the magic just goes away.

52:57.883 --> 53:00.219
Hey.

53:00.219 --> 53:02.012
I've got an idea.

53:02.012 --> 53:03.639
This will be fun.

53:04.681 --> 53:07.935
Why don't you guys
open your presents?

53:07.935 --> 53:12.231
I want to see what you
rich assholes get each other.

53:12.231 --> 53:18.195
And some of you might not
make it till tomorrow morning,

53:18.195 --> 53:21.198
so this could be
your only chance.

53:22.032 --> 53:23.492
Come on.

53:23.492 --> 53:26.245
Where's the Christmas spirit?

53:27.788 --> 53:29.873
Uh...

53:30.749 --> 53:35.170
Gertrude, uh, I got you
something pretty special.

53:35.170 --> 53:36.505
Did you hear that, Gertrude?

53:36.505 --> 53:38.465
He got you something amazing.

53:38.465 --> 53:41.385
Oh, what could it be?

53:41.385 --> 53:43.804
Oh, my God, this is exciting.

53:43.804 --> 53:46.014
Mom.

53:46.014 --> 53:47.724
Can I call you Mom?

53:48.934 --> 53:50.561
Mrs. Lightstone.

53:52.396 --> 53:55.774
Okay, so in the business,
they call this...

53:56.775 --> 53:58.235
...a pitch deck.

53:59.153 --> 54:00.237
- Pitch deck.
- Yeah.

54:00.237 --> 54:02.030
It's called Explosive Force.

54:02.030 --> 54:03.574
Starring me.

54:03.574 --> 54:05.325
And if you look in the back,

54:05.325 --> 54:08.787
there are the financial numbers.

54:08.787 --> 54:12.332
I'm kind of a big deal in Asia.

54:13.584 --> 54:15.752
Parts of Asia, at least.

54:15.752 --> 54:17.838
We were in parts of Asia once,
and, like,

54:17.838 --> 54:19.590
we couldn't even go
to a restaurant.

54:19.590 --> 54:23.093
Ah, what is there
a better gift than...

54:23.093 --> 54:26.430
gift of a golden opportunity?

54:27.764 --> 54:30.017
Oh, no.

54:31.268 --> 54:33.729
Granny doesn't like it.

54:33.729 --> 54:36.356
Mother, I got you something
really special.

54:42.613 --> 54:45.282
It's a sentimental photo
of the day I was born.

54:45.282 --> 54:47.326
I remember.

54:47.326 --> 54:48.702
I was there.

54:48.702 --> 54:50.954
She doesn't give a shit.

54:53.415 --> 54:55.125
- Swing and miss again!

54:55.125 --> 54:56.418
This is so fun.

54:56.418 --> 54:57.628
Mommy, how about another one?

54:57.628 --> 54:59.338
I got you a lot of good things.

54:59.338 --> 55:01.381
- I'll grab one.
- Alva, Alva, sit down.

55:01.381 --> 55:03.133
You've already given me one.
It's...

55:03.133 --> 55:04.384
It's Jason's turn.

55:04.384 --> 55:05.802
Uh...

55:05.802 --> 55:09.264
I th... I-I think
I left it in the car.

55:09.264 --> 55:11.517
No, I-I saw you put one
under the tree earlier.

55:11.517 --> 55:13.894
- No. It's in the...
- Yeah, I did.

55:13.894 --> 55:16.980
I could've sworn.
You know what, it's, uh...

55:16.980 --> 55:19.066
Y-You don't... you don't...
you don't... you...

55:19.066 --> 55:21.693
It's this one, right?
Yeah, I got you, bro.

55:21.693 --> 55:23.153
Come on.

55:24.905 --> 55:26.949
Thank you.

55:27.991 --> 55:30.202
It's my favorite whiskey.

55:30.202 --> 55:32.871
You can skip the note.

55:56.228 --> 55:57.980
Thank you, Jason.

56:03.360 --> 56:05.696
What's the card say?

56:05.696 --> 56:08.615
I think I'll just keep that
between Jason and I.

56:08.615 --> 56:12.744
No one really needs to know.
Right, Jason?

56:15.205 --> 56:16.915
Right.

56:17.874 --> 56:20.252
Did you ever have
a mommy and daddy?

56:22.045 --> 56:24.089
Yeah, of course
I had a mommy and daddy.

56:24.089 --> 56:27.759
I wasn't...
I wasn't always Santa Claus.

56:28.594 --> 56:30.887
I had a life before this.

56:31.805 --> 56:34.558
A long, long, long time ago.

56:38.729 --> 56:41.857
They used to call me, uh...

56:41.857 --> 56:43.775
Nicomund.

56:47.529 --> 56:49.156
Nicomund the Red.

56:50.741 --> 56:53.493
You had a different job then?

56:53.493 --> 56:56.246
Yeah, you could say that.

56:56.246 --> 56:58.123
I was a warrior.

56:58.123 --> 57:00.208
A raider. A thief.

57:00.208 --> 57:04.004
- And if somebody got in my way,

57:04.004 --> 57:05.756
me and Skullcrusher would...

57:05.756 --> 57:07.424
Who's Skullcrusher?

57:08.258 --> 57:11.386
Skullcrusher's my, uh...

57:11.386 --> 57:14.097
my hammer.

57:14.097 --> 57:16.350
My favorite hammer.

57:16.350 --> 57:18.727
I was a surgeon with that thing.

57:18.727 --> 57:21.188
Used to be able to take
three heads, line 'em up...

57:22.773 --> 57:25.359
But why?

57:25.359 --> 57:26.818
What?

57:26.818 --> 57:29.446
Why'd you do those things?

57:31.406 --> 57:33.492
Because I was mean.

57:34.660 --> 57:36.787
And I was greedy.

57:38.622 --> 57:41.416
And I wanted gold, jewels.

57:41.416 --> 57:44.127
Yeah, I mean, if there was
a naughty list back then,

57:44.127 --> 57:46.129
I'd be top dog.

57:47.714 --> 57:49.841
Well, maybe...

57:50.842 --> 57:52.052
What?

57:52.052 --> 57:54.179
Maybe all those bad things
you used to do...

57:55.263 --> 57:58.558
...maybe you can use them
to do good things instead.

57:59.351 --> 58:01.645
To help.

58:01.645 --> 58:03.563
What do you mean?

58:03.563 --> 58:07.943
Mr. Bunny, he wasn't just a toy.

58:07.943 --> 58:11.363
That night, you gave me
what I wished for.

58:11.363 --> 58:13.240
A best friend.

58:14.282 --> 58:16.910
'Cause you're good and kind.

58:16.910 --> 58:20.497
And you mean more than just
the presents you bring.

58:20.497 --> 58:23.166
That's why I believe in you,
Santa.

58:23.166 --> 58:25.585
That's why I believe.

58:31.174 --> 58:32.843
Thank you.

58:34.678 --> 58:38.640
You stay hidden, Trudy,
till I come get you.

58:38.640 --> 58:40.559
Stay safe.

58:41.518 --> 58:44.438
All right,
we got satellite confirmation.

58:44.438 --> 58:46.565
Extraction team's on the go.

58:46.565 --> 58:48.859
30 minutes.

58:48.859 --> 58:50.527
We're on schedule.

58:50.527 --> 58:51.945
Everything's good.

58:51.945 --> 58:53.530
- All right, fellas.

58:53.530 --> 58:54.948
Look alive, look alive.

58:54.948 --> 58:56.867
You all know the plan,

58:56.867 --> 59:00.245
and I like my operations

59:00.245 --> 59:03.039
hard and fast
with minimal cleanup.

59:03.039 --> 59:07.586
Now, some idiot gets
in your way, what do you do?

59:07.586 --> 59:09.671
Fuck their shit up right!

59:09.671 --> 59:11.339
Damn right.

59:12.132 --> 59:14.843
- Time to lube up.

59:15.969 --> 59:18.680
Let's go, motherfuckers!
Let's go!

59:24.603 --> 59:26.855
This fucking family.

59:46.124 --> 59:48.376
Ho, ho, ho, ho.

59:48.376 --> 59:50.170
- Merry Christmas.

59:50.170 --> 59:51.421
Happy holidays.

59:51.421 --> 59:52.547
Traitor.

59:54.007 --> 59:56.009
I got him in the east wing.

59:56.009 --> 59:58.470
All right,
we're on our way. Hold him.

1:00:11.775 --> 1:00:13.777
Step aside.

1:00:27.290 --> 1:00:30.085
Now, how did this tired, old,

1:00:30.085 --> 1:00:32.754
fat piece of shit
get the drop on us?

1:00:32.754 --> 1:00:34.214
I don't know.

1:00:34.214 --> 1:00:36.216
He's not even armed.

1:00:36.216 --> 1:00:38.635
This bag is the only thing
he had on him.

1:00:38.635 --> 1:00:40.053
What's in there?

1:00:40.804 --> 1:00:42.848
Can't see anything.

1:00:46.935 --> 1:00:48.395
Here, give it to me.

1:00:59.489 --> 1:01:01.992
What kind of moron...

1:01:01.992 --> 1:01:04.244
carries a chess set with him?

1:01:07.873 --> 1:01:09.416
What the fuck?

1:01:09.416 --> 1:01:11.960
Doesn't make any sense.
Look at all this shit.

1:01:19.175 --> 1:01:22.178
So, you're gonna tell us what's
the gimmick with the bag?

1:01:22.178 --> 1:01:23.847
It's magic.

1:01:23.847 --> 1:01:26.766
You put your hand in,
out comes a present.

1:01:28.351 --> 1:01:31.104
I don't really understand
how it works, either.

1:01:32.480 --> 1:01:35.525
So, you're Mr. Scrooge.

1:01:35.525 --> 1:01:37.527
That's right.

1:01:37.527 --> 1:01:39.321
But who are you?

1:01:39.321 --> 1:01:41.364
Weihnachtsmann.

1:01:42.741 --> 1:01:44.701
Julenissen.

1:01:45.577 --> 1:01:47.495
Shèngdàn Laorén.

1:01:48.330 --> 1:01:51.541
Babbo Natale, Père Noel,
Kris Kringle.

1:01:51.541 --> 1:01:54.044
Jolly old Saint Nick.

1:01:54.044 --> 1:01:57.088
People call me a lot of things.

1:01:57.923 --> 1:02:00.550
Ha, ha, ha. Very funny.

1:02:00.550 --> 1:02:02.928
Or should I say, "Ho, ho, ho"?

1:02:02.928 --> 1:02:06.514
If you're Santa,
where's your reindeer?

1:02:06.514 --> 1:02:08.350
They were on the roof

1:02:08.350 --> 1:02:10.977
until that guy I turned
into an ice kebab just...

1:02:13.605 --> 1:02:15.231
You don't believe me?

1:02:15.231 --> 1:02:16.358
Go check.

1:02:16.358 --> 1:02:19.110
Prancer left
a tasty log up there.

1:02:19.110 --> 1:02:20.946
This fucking guy.

1:02:20.946 --> 1:02:22.656
You don't think...

1:02:22.656 --> 1:02:25.825
Now, I know you're an idiot,
but don't be an idiot out loud.

1:02:25.825 --> 1:02:27.911
Come on,
he's just in Santy Claus

1:02:27.911 --> 1:02:29.913
with a fucking trick bag.

1:02:29.913 --> 1:02:31.915
Oh, no!

1:02:31.915 --> 1:02:33.750
That bag was full
of kids' dreams!

1:02:33.750 --> 1:02:35.543
Oh, come on.

1:02:35.543 --> 1:02:37.837
Everybody knows that
Christmas dreams are bullshit.

1:02:38.630 --> 1:02:41.257
My father used to make
a big deal out of it

1:02:41.257 --> 1:02:43.051
every Christmas.

1:02:43.051 --> 1:02:45.220
Every freaking Christmas
with the presents

1:02:45.220 --> 1:02:47.430
and the candy
and the decorations

1:02:47.430 --> 1:02:51.226
and the Christmas caroling
and all that bullshit.

1:02:52.602 --> 1:02:54.896
And then when I was...

1:02:54.896 --> 1:02:58.316
I don't know, ten, 11,

1:02:58.316 --> 1:03:00.276
he got laid off,
and that Christmas,

1:03:00.276 --> 1:03:01.778
couldn't even afford a tree.

1:03:01.778 --> 1:03:03.321
No Christmas dinner, no gifts.

1:03:03.321 --> 1:03:05.949
Nothing, nada, culo, dick.

1:03:06.741 --> 1:03:08.118
But our neighbors...

1:03:08.118 --> 1:03:09.995
our neighbors,
oh, they had it all.

1:03:09.995 --> 1:03:11.788
I could see
all that yuletide cheer

1:03:11.788 --> 1:03:14.332
through their window mocking me.

1:03:14.332 --> 1:03:18.253
So Christmas Eve
rolls around, and...

1:03:18.253 --> 1:03:21.297
I waited for everybody
to go to bed.

1:03:21.297 --> 1:03:24.634
And then I snuck in there
to take it all.

1:03:25.635 --> 1:03:28.179
Only problem was that
the gramps got up to take a piss

1:03:28.179 --> 1:03:30.598
and the two of us scared
the shit out of each other.

1:03:30.598 --> 1:03:33.643
And, um, he fell down the stairs

1:03:33.643 --> 1:03:38.189
and-and broke his neck,
and he died in the hospital.

1:03:38.189 --> 1:03:39.816
Everybody thought that I did it,

1:03:39.816 --> 1:03:41.317
and every time
I tried to tell them,

1:03:41.317 --> 1:03:43.820
I tried to tell them that...

1:03:45.280 --> 1:03:47.657
Anyway, maybe I did do it.

1:03:47.657 --> 1:03:49.701
Maybe I did push him.

1:03:49.701 --> 1:03:51.494
Poor old fucker.

1:03:51.494 --> 1:03:54.998
So, you see,
Christmas ruined my life.

1:03:54.998 --> 1:03:56.666
Okay? But you know what?

1:03:56.666 --> 1:03:58.001
It set me on the path

1:03:58.001 --> 1:04:00.045
and made me the great man
that I am today.

1:04:00.045 --> 1:04:02.088
I'm sorry, Jimmy.

1:04:02.881 --> 1:04:04.424
I really am.

1:04:05.258 --> 1:04:07.302
But I do gifts.
I do Christmas cheer.

1:04:07.302 --> 1:04:09.512
I don't get involved
in people's lives.

1:04:09.512 --> 1:04:13.391
Oh, yeah? Yeah, well,
maybe you fucking should!

1:04:17.896 --> 1:04:21.066
Um, how did he know your name?

1:04:21.066 --> 1:04:22.776
Oh, Bjorn.

1:04:22.776 --> 1:04:24.903
What's your excuse?

1:04:24.903 --> 1:04:26.488
Huh?

1:04:26.488 --> 1:04:29.824
Didn't I get you that Huffy bike
you wanted back in '82?

1:04:29.824 --> 1:04:33.036
One you wrote me 50 times about!

1:04:33.036 --> 1:04:34.537
What about you, Kira?

1:04:34.537 --> 1:04:37.707
Well, you made your brother
eat worms.

1:04:37.707 --> 1:04:39.209
That's naughty!

1:04:39.209 --> 1:04:41.127
Okay, how does he know
about my bike?

1:04:41.127 --> 1:04:44.547
"Hey, do you like big tits?"

1:04:44.547 --> 1:04:46.758
Come on, every kid wants
a fucking bike.

1:04:46.758 --> 1:04:49.886
- You're gonna tell me who you
work for... -Oh, Christ. No.

1:04:49.886 --> 1:04:53.181
...then you've got five seconds
to tell me who you really are.

1:04:53.181 --> 1:04:56.017
Five, four, three, two...

1:04:56.017 --> 1:04:57.727
I'm Santa Claus!

1:04:57.727 --> 1:05:00.021
Well, not anymore.

1:05:24.921 --> 1:05:26.756
Is it snowing?

1:05:26.756 --> 1:05:30.176
Is he doing this
with Santa magic?

1:05:36.683 --> 1:05:39.060
Let it snow!

1:05:50.780 --> 1:05:52.782
It's not snow.

1:05:52.782 --> 1:05:54.117
It's Styrofoam.

1:05:54.117 --> 1:05:56.369
I told you this guy's
a big phony.

1:06:10.800 --> 1:06:12.677
Where'd he go?

1:06:12.677 --> 1:06:14.304
He went up the chimney.

1:06:14.304 --> 1:06:15.972
- I saw it.
- I don't know,

1:06:15.972 --> 1:06:17.807
he had a rig
or some pulley system

1:06:17.807 --> 1:06:19.809
- that just yanked him up.
- You can't fit up there.

1:06:19.809 --> 1:06:21.519
- It's impossible.
- Oh, you see one weird thing,

1:06:21.519 --> 1:06:23.855
and then you think
you're in a fairy tale?

1:06:23.855 --> 1:06:25.148
Incoming.

1:06:25.148 --> 1:06:26.024
We've got sleigh bells
approaching.

1:06:26.024 --> 1:06:27.817
Oh, my God.

1:06:27.817 --> 1:06:29.694
It's his reindeer.

1:06:31.321 --> 1:06:33.323
- It's the extraction team.

1:06:33.323 --> 1:06:35.533
Pull yourselves together!

1:06:50.465 --> 1:06:54.761
And that is the sound
of my Kill Squad.

1:06:56.221 --> 1:06:58.306
Oh, you're fizzity-fucked now.

1:06:58.306 --> 1:07:00.516
Huh? What are you gonna do?
You little elf bitch.

1:07:00.516 --> 1:07:01.976
Fu...

1:07:01.976 --> 1:07:03.144
Bertie.

1:07:03.144 --> 1:07:04.687
Hashtag "blessed."

1:07:07.732 --> 1:07:10.360
Yeah!

1:07:10.360 --> 1:07:11.361
Parkour.

1:07:11.361 --> 1:07:12.528
Kill him, babe!

1:07:12.528 --> 1:07:15.198
-Oh!

1:07:16.074 --> 1:07:17.700
Morgan's gonna save us.

1:07:19.452 --> 1:07:23.206
Jean-Claude Van Dipshit
just ditched us, sweetie.

1:07:30.213 --> 1:07:32.215
Hold your fire.

1:07:32.215 --> 1:07:33.841
Barrel roll!

1:07:35.551 --> 1:07:36.844
Easy, easy.

1:07:36.844 --> 1:07:38.763
-Yeah!
- Easy.

1:07:38.763 --> 1:07:40.056
Identify yourself.

1:07:40.056 --> 1:07:42.433
I'm one of the hostages.

1:07:42.433 --> 1:07:45.561
Morgan Steel, the actor.

1:07:45.561 --> 1:07:48.564
Played a lot of soldiers
in my career.

1:07:48.564 --> 1:07:52.151
Can I just say, thank you
for your service. Semper fi.

1:07:52.986 --> 1:07:54.904
What's the situation inside?

1:07:54.904 --> 1:07:57.323
Bunch of ex-military guys,

1:07:57.323 --> 1:07:59.325
but I got to warn you,
they know you're coming.

1:07:59.325 --> 1:08:00.994
I think they're ready for you.

1:08:00.994 --> 1:08:02.829
They better be.

1:08:02.829 --> 1:08:04.914
We're on a tight schedule.

1:08:04.914 --> 1:08:06.749
Shit.

1:08:10.086 --> 1:08:12.213
Oh, f...

1:08:12.213 --> 1:08:15.508
- All right, let's move out.
- Let's move out.

1:08:19.679 --> 1:08:21.306
Come on.

1:08:21.306 --> 1:08:23.516
You got to be kidding me.

1:08:23.516 --> 1:08:25.226
Hey, Thorp,
you're ten minutes late.

1:08:25.226 --> 1:08:26.602
What kept you?

1:08:26.602 --> 1:08:28.938
Looks to me like your net's
got a hole in it.

1:08:28.938 --> 1:08:31.399
Or are you just letting your
hostages out for some exercise?

1:08:31.399 --> 1:08:33.651
No, no, no. We got
a wild gopher running around

1:08:33.651 --> 1:08:36.237
complicating shit
and causing problems.

1:08:36.237 --> 1:08:37.822
Who? Lightstone security?

1:08:37.822 --> 1:08:39.407
Nah, I don't think so.
Some intruder dressed as Santa.

1:08:39.407 --> 1:08:40.825
But I'm telling you,
I'm telling you,

1:08:40.825 --> 1:08:43.036
there's something weird
about him.

1:08:43.036 --> 1:08:44.662
Might be the real Santa.

1:08:44.662 --> 1:08:47.123
- The fuck did she just say?
- Nothing, nothing.

1:08:47.123 --> 1:08:48.207
She's joking.

1:08:48.207 --> 1:08:50.710
My squad will take care of it.

1:08:53.087 --> 1:08:55.798
Beta Team, go find this asshole.

1:08:55.798 --> 1:08:57.800
Go.

1:08:57.800 --> 1:09:02.138
Now, let's unwrap our present,
shall we?

1:09:02.138 --> 1:09:04.390
All right, you heard the man.

1:09:04.390 --> 1:09:07.018
Time to kill Santa.

1:09:07.018 --> 1:09:09.479
I've got him. He's on the roof.

1:09:09.479 --> 1:09:11.773
Roger that. I got eyes on him.

1:09:29.165 --> 1:09:31.167
Right, Sugarplum.
Hit that button.

1:09:38.132 --> 1:09:40.009
Here we go.

1:09:40.009 --> 1:09:41.386
Our skeleton key.

1:09:41.386 --> 1:09:43.262
The "open" magic stick.

1:09:43.262 --> 1:09:44.972
This better fucking work.

1:09:44.972 --> 1:09:47.642
I'm flushing my career for this,
my reputation.

1:09:47.642 --> 1:09:50.436
Yeah, well, then you can
buy yourself a new rep.

1:09:59.362 --> 1:10:00.863
As a kid, I loved

1:10:00.863 --> 1:10:02.907
unwrapping Christmas presents
so much

1:10:02.907 --> 1:10:05.868
that my mom would wrap
empty boxes for me.

1:10:06.786 --> 1:10:09.205
I didn't care
that nothing was inside.

1:10:21.175 --> 1:10:23.761
Is this a fucking joke?

1:10:23.761 --> 1:10:24.971
No.

1:10:26.347 --> 1:10:28.266
You said it would
fucking be here!

1:10:28.266 --> 1:10:31.894
I'm telling you,
my intel was rock solid.

1:10:31.894 --> 1:10:34.188
I had guys on the inside.

1:10:35.231 --> 1:10:38.943
300 million in cash
was delivered here yesterday

1:10:38.943 --> 1:10:41.237
to this fucking mansion.

1:10:46.242 --> 1:10:48.911
Somebody must've intercepted it.

1:10:52.915 --> 1:10:54.959
Son of a bitch.

1:11:17.356 --> 1:11:18.900
Oh, shit.

1:11:18.900 --> 1:11:21.444
Santa, you okay?

1:11:21.444 --> 1:11:23.029
Santa.

1:11:23.029 --> 1:11:25.323
A bunch of new bad guys
showed up.

1:11:25.323 --> 1:11:27.116
They're on the naughty list.

1:11:27.116 --> 1:11:30.119
They got their gadgets
and their gizmos on them.

1:11:30.953 --> 1:11:33.539
I'm sorry.
I think this is it, kid.

1:11:33.539 --> 1:11:35.333
No, no, don't say that.

1:11:35.333 --> 1:11:37.335
The naughty list...

1:11:37.335 --> 1:11:39.754
just grows and grows.

1:11:48.471 --> 1:11:52.308
He's in that structure.
Body cams on.

1:11:52.308 --> 1:11:54.393
Don't give up.

1:11:54.393 --> 1:11:56.979
You make a wish this time,
Santa.

1:11:56.979 --> 1:11:58.606
Just this once.

1:11:58.606 --> 1:12:01.526
If you could have anything
in this world,

1:12:01.526 --> 1:12:03.778
what would it be?

1:12:09.492 --> 1:12:12.537
I wish I could see
Mrs. Claus again,

1:12:12.537 --> 1:12:15.665
tell her how much I love her.

1:12:15.665 --> 1:12:18.501
Then you make
that wish come true.

1:12:18.501 --> 1:12:20.670
- Oh, shit.

1:12:20.670 --> 1:12:23.005
No, no, no, no. No, no.

1:12:24.757 --> 1:12:26.175
Oh, God.

1:12:26.175 --> 1:12:29.011
No.

1:12:41.399 --> 1:12:44.402
You said these guys,
they're naughty.

1:12:44.402 --> 1:12:47.363
And what do you do
to the naughty ones?

1:12:47.363 --> 1:12:49.240
I give them a lump of coal.

1:12:49.240 --> 1:12:51.492
Yeah. Give them their lumps.

1:12:52.702 --> 1:12:54.996
Take that coal and shove it
straight up their...

1:12:54.996 --> 1:12:57.248
- Anuses.
- Yeah!

1:13:03.212 --> 1:13:04.880
They're right outside.

1:13:19.061 --> 1:13:21.564
Santa's gonna eat
through these guys

1:13:21.564 --> 1:13:23.691
like a plate full of cookies.

1:13:28.237 --> 1:13:29.614
Move, move.

1:13:33.284 --> 1:13:35.077
Hey, lock it up.

1:13:36.996 --> 1:13:38.831
Lights down.

1:13:39.999 --> 1:13:41.917
Stay at my back.

1:13:41.917 --> 1:13:44.045
All right, we got this, boys.

1:14:02.897 --> 1:14:05.274
All right, where the fuck
is my money?!

1:14:05.274 --> 1:14:07.652
Where's the money?!

1:14:18.287 --> 1:14:21.207
All right, I've been
a sweetheart up to now.

1:14:21.207 --> 1:14:22.667
But that's all over.

1:14:22.667 --> 1:14:24.460
No more fucking games!

1:14:24.460 --> 1:14:25.961
Where's the money?

1:14:25.961 --> 1:14:29.006
Or I will shoot every last
one of you and enjoy it.

1:14:33.135 --> 1:14:35.888
- It's in the vault.
- I just looked in the vault.

1:14:35.888 --> 1:14:37.306
Had the money been in there,

1:14:37.306 --> 1:14:39.141
I'd have a different
expression on my face.

1:14:39.141 --> 1:14:40.518
Impossible.

1:14:40.518 --> 1:14:42.603
Takes days to get
into that thing.

1:14:42.603 --> 1:14:46.107
Not if we have the key,
Mrs. Lightstone.

1:14:47.483 --> 1:14:49.527
Thorp.

1:14:50.903 --> 1:14:53.489
You can't trust anyone
these days.

1:14:53.489 --> 1:14:55.658
I'm not sure how, but you

1:14:55.658 --> 1:14:58.536
or one of your shithead kids
moved the money.

1:14:58.536 --> 1:15:00.413
And this upsets me.

1:15:00.413 --> 1:15:02.248
It upsets me

1:15:02.248 --> 1:15:06.252
in a way that makes me want to
just randomly shoot at people.

1:15:07.253 --> 1:15:09.463
Hold on. Just... Sorry.

1:15:09.463 --> 1:15:10.881
- Um...
- What? What?

1:15:10.881 --> 1:15:12.258
Uh, what if you randomly shoot

1:15:12.258 --> 1:15:14.844
the only person
who knows where it is?

1:15:15.845 --> 1:15:18.180
Oh, fuck you people!

1:15:52.840 --> 1:15:54.425
Suck on this.

1:16:19.408 --> 1:16:20.910
I need some feedback, guys.

1:16:22.495 --> 1:16:24.455
Guys, what the hell is going on?

1:17:09.458 --> 1:17:10.876
- What's that?
- Huh?

1:17:49.874 --> 1:17:52.001
Jesus Christ.

1:17:52.751 --> 1:17:55.170
Nope. Just jolly old Saint Nick.

1:18:07.725 --> 1:18:10.477
-Oh, God!
- There you go.

1:18:10.477 --> 1:18:12.187
A little stocking stuffer.

1:18:12.980 --> 1:18:16.567
Where is it?
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

1:18:16.567 --> 1:18:19.028
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

1:18:19.028 --> 1:18:21.739
- I got to watch.
- Fuck!

1:18:22.865 --> 1:18:25.075
Ho-Ho-Holy shit.

1:18:27.369 --> 1:18:30.080
Gertrude would never
trust anybody

1:18:30.080 --> 1:18:32.541
who wasn't blood
with this kind of info.

1:18:32.541 --> 1:18:34.251
So...

1:18:34.251 --> 1:18:37.880
the in-laws wouldn't know shit,

1:18:37.880 --> 1:18:40.424
which means
that I can shoot her...

1:18:41.967 --> 1:18:43.969
...unless you tell me
where the fucking money is.

1:18:43.969 --> 1:18:46.221
Please don't, okay?
It's Christmas.

1:18:46.221 --> 1:18:48.057
Shut up!

1:18:48.933 --> 1:18:50.351
I swear,
I'll blow her brains out

1:18:50.351 --> 1:18:51.769
unless you tell me
where the money went.

1:18:51.769 --> 1:18:53.979
I did it!

1:18:53.979 --> 1:18:56.398
- What?
- Okay. Yeah, I did it.

1:18:56.398 --> 1:18:58.317
- I moved the money.
- No, d-don't-don't be an idiot.

1:18:58.317 --> 1:19:00.069
- What?
- The money's our only leverage.

1:19:00.069 --> 1:19:01.654
Well, my wife has a fucking
gun to her head, so...

1:19:01.654 --> 1:19:03.739
Yeah, how did you find out
that we were coming, huh?

1:19:03.739 --> 1:19:05.407
I didn't. I was stealing it.

1:19:06.575 --> 1:19:08.035
- Yeah, coincidence.
- Oh, my God.

1:19:08.035 --> 1:19:09.411
I was planning to take the money

1:19:09.411 --> 1:19:12.581
and leave with my wife
and daughter tonight

1:19:12.581 --> 1:19:14.583
and never come back here.

1:19:14.583 --> 1:19:17.962
Oh, and then my mom would, uh,

1:19:17.962 --> 1:19:19.964
read the note with her whiskey
in the morning

1:19:19.964 --> 1:19:21.757
and know what I had done.

1:19:21.757 --> 1:19:24.051
For years,
I have been telling you

1:19:24.051 --> 1:19:26.428
to stop caring about
your mother's fucking money!

1:19:26.428 --> 1:19:29.682
And you think the solution
was to steal a bunch of it.

1:19:30.474 --> 1:19:32.685
Well, it...
yeah, it does sound stupid

1:19:32.685 --> 1:19:34.186
when you say it like that.

1:19:34.186 --> 1:19:36.188
How can you do this right now?

1:19:36.188 --> 1:19:38.273
It's disgusting. After all
that Mother has given us?

1:19:38.273 --> 1:19:40.484
Come on, Alva.
Everything she ever gave you,

1:19:40.484 --> 1:19:41.777
she made damn sure we knew

1:19:41.777 --> 1:19:43.028
she had the power
to take right back.

1:19:43.028 --> 1:19:46.907
I have spent years
groveling to you.

1:19:46.907 --> 1:19:49.702
In the meanwhile,
I was destroying

1:19:49.702 --> 1:19:51.745
the only good thing in my life.

1:19:51.745 --> 1:19:53.122
What are we doing here, huh?

1:19:53.122 --> 1:19:55.749
Family therapy or doing a heist?

1:19:55.749 --> 1:19:59.003
- Yeah, enough of this sharing
bullshit. -

1:19:59.003 --> 1:20:00.963
All right. Where'd you put it?

1:20:07.136 --> 1:20:09.805
Look at this little idiot.

1:20:13.517 --> 1:20:14.893
Oh, no.

1:20:14.893 --> 1:20:16.729
What?

1:20:16.729 --> 1:20:18.647
- The bad guys found me.
- Okay.

1:20:18.647 --> 1:20:20.482
I'm coming.

1:20:27.072 --> 1:20:30.993
You know, booby traps don't work
unless you hide them.

1:20:33.662 --> 1:20:35.164
You little moron.

1:20:38.208 --> 1:20:40.544
- Jesus! Shit!

1:20:44.423 --> 1:20:46.592
Help me! Help me! Help!

1:20:48.010 --> 1:20:50.137
You'll be f...
You'll be fine.

1:20:50.137 --> 1:20:52.306
Sit tight.
I'll be back in a sec.

1:20:55.184 --> 1:20:57.519
Right after I kill
this little piece of shit!

1:21:00.272 --> 1:21:02.691
You little fucking brat.

1:21:51.115 --> 1:21:52.908
You're dead!

1:21:52.908 --> 1:21:55.410
You're so fucking dead!

1:22:02.584 --> 1:22:05.045
Fucking piece of shit.

1:22:10.092 --> 1:22:12.928
You little...

1:22:30.195 --> 1:22:32.239
- Incoming!

1:22:50.966 --> 1:22:52.801
Son of a fucking...

1:23:02.853 --> 1:23:04.813
Fuck.

1:23:04.813 --> 1:23:06.607
I got you now, kid.

1:23:06.607 --> 1:23:08.275
Yeah? Heads up.

1:23:10.402 --> 1:23:12.029
That's all you got?
You fucking...

1:23:14.865 --> 1:23:17.409
Enough of this shit.

1:23:42.976 --> 1:23:44.186
Santa!

1:23:54.112 --> 1:23:56.365
Hi, Trudy. Hi.

1:23:56.365 --> 1:23:59.201
I made booby traps like
in the movie. It was so funny.

1:23:59.201 --> 1:24:01.828
Ho, ho, ho.

1:24:07.709 --> 1:24:11.630
Trudy, I want you to, uh...
just do me a favor.

1:24:12.464 --> 1:24:15.384
Just turn around
and close your eyes.

1:24:15.384 --> 1:24:18.220
Maybe put your fingers
in your ears and, uh,

1:24:18.220 --> 1:24:21.265
sing "Jingle Bells"
as loud as you can.

1:24:27.813 --> 1:24:30.774
You were about to murder
an innocent child.

1:24:32.109 --> 1:24:33.735
Innocent?

1:24:33.735 --> 1:24:35.737
- It's naughty.

1:24:35.737 --> 1:24:37.197
Naughty.

1:24:37.948 --> 1:24:39.408
- Naughty!

1:24:39.408 --> 1:24:41.118
It's part of
the Lightstone legacy.

1:24:41.118 --> 1:24:42.744
We're horrible people.

1:24:42.744 --> 1:24:44.621
So I get why you did
what you did.

1:24:44.621 --> 1:24:46.707
When your grandfather told me
I'd never run the company

1:24:46.707 --> 1:24:49.126
because a girl
doesn't have what it takes,

1:24:49.126 --> 1:24:51.128
I had to snatch the reins
away from him.

1:24:51.128 --> 1:24:52.587
But the point is,

1:24:52.587 --> 1:24:54.339
a Lightstone takes
what's theirs.

1:24:54.339 --> 1:24:56.008
I'm proud of you, son.

1:24:56.008 --> 1:24:57.467
All right, where the hell is it?

1:24:59.803 --> 1:25:01.722
The money's hidden inside.

1:25:02.889 --> 1:25:06.018
And the Three Wise Men
presented him with gifts

1:25:06.018 --> 1:25:08.854
of frankincense, myrrh...

1:25:10.981 --> 1:25:14.067
...and cold hard cash.

1:25:14.067 --> 1:25:15.527
Load it up, boys.

1:25:15.527 --> 1:25:17.779
All right,
we're securing the money.

1:25:17.779 --> 1:25:19.865
Kill the hostages
and meet us outside.

1:25:19.865 --> 1:25:21.658
What?

1:25:21.658 --> 1:25:23.660
No.

1:25:25.454 --> 1:25:26.913
Mom.

1:25:26.913 --> 1:25:28.290
It's fine, Bert.

1:25:28.290 --> 1:25:29.791
Everything's fine.

1:25:29.791 --> 1:25:31.877
Okay.

1:25:31.877 --> 1:25:33.795
Everybody, get up.

1:25:33.795 --> 1:25:38.300
It's time for a murder.

1:25:38.300 --> 1:25:40.886
Come on. Come on.
You don't want to kill us.

1:25:40.886 --> 1:25:42.220
You really don't.

1:25:42.220 --> 1:25:44.389
Oh, yes, I do.

1:25:44.389 --> 1:25:47.476
I really, really, really do.

1:25:47.476 --> 1:25:49.186
And I'm gonna start with you.

1:25:49.186 --> 1:25:50.520
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1:25:50.520 --> 1:25:51.813
Wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

1:25:53.523 --> 1:25:55.233
You got to kill
Aunt Linda first.

1:25:55.233 --> 1:25:56.985
What the hell, Bert?

1:25:56.985 --> 1:25:59.071
You want to squeeze in
being a little shit

1:25:59.071 --> 1:26:00.614
before you die, Bertrude?

1:26:00.614 --> 1:26:02.240
- I say shoot him first.
- What?

1:26:02.240 --> 1:26:04.326
Wait. No, no, no.
Don't shoot him.

1:26:04.326 --> 1:26:06.370
Don't shoot him first.
And don't you call him

1:26:06.370 --> 1:26:08.080
a little shit,
you gold-digging bitch.

1:26:08.080 --> 1:26:09.790
Okay. I changed my mind.

1:26:09.790 --> 1:26:11.750
- Shoot the alcoholic bitch
first. -Don't call my mom

1:26:11.750 --> 1:26:13.835
- an alcoholic bitch.
- Your mom's an alcoholic.

1:26:13.835 --> 1:26:15.670
- I'm sorry.
- You're a gold-digging bitch.

1:26:15.670 --> 1:26:17.839
Oh, I'm a gold-digger,
when I have a whole-ass career?

1:26:17.839 --> 1:26:19.508
You're not even part
of the fucking family.

1:26:19.508 --> 1:26:22.260
- She's an engineer.
- You know goddamn well...

1:26:22.260 --> 1:26:23.637
Shut up!

1:26:27.349 --> 1:26:31.436
Just like rats in a barrel.

1:26:32.229 --> 1:26:34.398
Why don't you die
with some dignity?

1:26:39.444 --> 1:26:41.363
Get off of me!

1:26:41.363 --> 1:26:43.115
Okay, okay.

1:26:43.115 --> 1:26:44.366
Fuck you!

1:26:44.366 --> 1:26:46.952
This is for yelling at my child!

1:26:46.952 --> 1:26:48.370
Creep!

1:26:48.370 --> 1:26:49.913
That's for slapping me,
motherfucker!

1:26:49.913 --> 1:26:51.998
This is for
your dumb fucking hat!

1:27:01.633 --> 1:27:03.301
Is he...

1:27:03.301 --> 1:27:04.845
Is he dead?

1:27:08.723 --> 1:27:10.600
Yeah.

1:27:11.393 --> 1:27:13.019
Thanks, Linda.

1:27:13.019 --> 1:27:16.231
Well, it's nice to do something
as a family for a change.

1:27:17.399 --> 1:27:19.109
--Oh, shit!

1:27:19.109 --> 1:27:20.986
I'm gonna...

1:27:25.073 --> 1:27:26.616
That was for Morgan.

1:27:26.616 --> 1:27:31.621
He may have been stupid,
but he was very, very hot.

1:27:32.998 --> 1:27:35.375
Oh. Trudy!

1:27:35.375 --> 1:27:37.794
- Mommy!

1:27:37.794 --> 1:27:39.421
Thank God, baby.

1:27:39.421 --> 1:27:41.339
Are you okay?

1:27:41.339 --> 1:27:43.091
I'm okay, Mommy.

1:27:43.091 --> 1:27:44.259
Okay.

1:27:44.259 --> 1:27:46.761
This is my friend, Santa.

1:27:51.183 --> 1:27:53.268
What the fuck?

1:27:53.268 --> 1:27:55.103
I can't thank you enough,
Mister...

1:27:55.103 --> 1:27:57.439
Claus. But please call me Santa.

1:27:57.439 --> 1:27:58.815
Mm-hmm.

1:27:58.815 --> 1:28:00.942
You guys should get out of here.

1:28:00.942 --> 1:28:02.402
It's dangerous.

1:28:02.402 --> 1:28:04.738
They took my husband
and her grandmother.

1:28:06.573 --> 1:28:08.200
Anybody know how to work
these gizmos?

1:28:08.200 --> 1:28:09.534
I think so.

1:28:09.534 --> 1:28:11.286
I used to hunt with my dad.

1:28:11.286 --> 1:28:12.454
Ow.

1:28:12.454 --> 1:28:14.122
Copy that. How's that looking?

1:28:14.122 --> 1:28:16.958
- Yeah, I got it on lockdown.
- Heads on a swivel, boys.

1:28:18.293 --> 1:28:19.920
- Incoming!
- Heads up!

1:28:21.129 --> 1:28:22.631
- Oh, oh! Who's shooting?

1:28:22.631 --> 1:28:24.299
- Who's...

1:28:24.299 --> 1:28:27.469
- Cap, get down!
- Watch it! Watch it!

1:28:32.557 --> 1:28:34.935
Gun 'em down. Mow them all down.

1:28:50.784 --> 1:28:53.620
- All right, let's get the fuck
out of here. -Let's go.

1:28:53.620 --> 1:28:56.122
- Go where?
- Come on, move, you old bat.

1:28:56.873 --> 1:28:58.833
Get your fucking
hands off of me.

1:29:08.969 --> 1:29:11.304
Oh! Oh, shit.

1:29:11.304 --> 1:29:14.683
My balls! My fucking balls!

1:29:31.324 --> 1:29:34.160
Ow, my balls! Why did you
shoot me in the ball...

1:29:37.998 --> 1:29:40.375
Oh, Jesus.

1:29:40.375 --> 1:29:42.043
Sorry.

1:29:43.878 --> 1:29:46.548
Don't worry about us, Mr. Claus.
We got this.

1:29:46.548 --> 1:29:48.800
Who is that guy?

1:29:48.800 --> 1:29:51.428
He said he was Mr. Claus.

1:29:53.221 --> 1:29:55.265
- Fuck. Trudy.
- No, no.

1:29:55.265 --> 1:29:56.891
She's in the house. She's okay.

1:29:56.891 --> 1:29:58.268
She's safe.

1:29:58.268 --> 1:30:00.395
- Oh, thank God.
- Yeah.

1:30:21.124 --> 1:30:22.584
No, no.

1:30:22.584 --> 1:30:25.253
- Oh... go, go, go, go, go.
- No, no, no. Wait, wait.

1:31:11.091 --> 1:31:13.510
Oh, shit!

1:31:15.762 --> 1:31:18.556
- Ho, ho!

1:31:20.266 --> 1:31:21.476
Fuck!

1:32:05.061 --> 1:32:07.731
- Fucking die.

1:33:00.909 --> 1:33:02.786
Come on. Come on. Come on.

1:33:02.786 --> 1:33:06.080
Yeah, over here. Over here.

1:33:06.080 --> 1:33:07.332
Santa!

1:33:08.291 --> 1:33:10.126
Come on!

1:33:10.126 --> 1:33:11.586
Yeah.

1:33:55.380 --> 1:33:56.631
Fuck.

1:34:20.321 --> 1:34:22.365
You're real?

1:34:23.741 --> 1:34:26.160
You're... him.

1:34:29.163 --> 1:34:30.415
You're you.

1:34:30.415 --> 1:34:33.126
That's what I've been trying
to tell you.

1:34:33.126 --> 1:34:36.504
The real goddamn Santa Claus.

1:34:36.504 --> 1:34:38.965
This is not your night, pal.

1:34:38.965 --> 1:34:42.093
Oh, I don't know.
I think you're wrong.

1:34:42.093 --> 1:34:45.513
I think my whole shitty life's
built up to this moment.

1:34:45.513 --> 1:34:46.890
Because when I kill you,

1:34:46.890 --> 1:34:50.184
this whole goddamn holiday
finally ends.

1:34:51.936 --> 1:34:53.855
Whatever it takes...

1:34:55.607 --> 1:34:57.692
...Christmas dies tonight.

1:35:49.911 --> 1:35:51.579
Whoa!

1:37:16.831 --> 1:37:19.417
The last Christmas.

1:37:29.260 --> 1:37:31.888
Not if you still believe.

1:37:33.681 --> 1:37:35.683
No!

1:38:03.711 --> 1:38:07.381
I have no idea what the fuck
is going on here.

1:38:09.759 --> 1:38:11.886
But this ends now.

1:38:16.808 --> 1:38:18.601
Damn right it does.

1:38:27.777 --> 1:38:29.946
Trudy, be careful.

1:38:33.658 --> 1:38:35.576
Santa!

1:38:35.576 --> 1:38:38.079
Oh, no. Santa.

1:38:39.539 --> 1:38:41.082
Oh, no.

1:38:47.880 --> 1:38:50.049
You saved my daughter.

1:38:50.842 --> 1:38:52.385
No.

1:38:53.177 --> 1:38:54.762
She saved me.

1:38:54.762 --> 1:38:57.515
Help him. Please help him.

1:38:57.515 --> 1:39:00.017
Honey, I don't think
there's anything we can do.

1:39:00.017 --> 1:39:01.269
It's okay. It's okay.

1:39:01.269 --> 1:39:03.604
It's too late for that.

1:39:03.604 --> 1:39:05.940
Too late.

1:39:06.732 --> 1:39:09.402
I'm cold.

1:39:09.402 --> 1:39:11.654
I haven't felt cold in years.

1:39:11.654 --> 1:39:13.698
We need to keep him warm.

1:39:14.532 --> 1:39:16.951
All of the fires are going out.

1:39:16.951 --> 1:39:19.245
We need to find
something to burn.

1:39:20.580 --> 1:39:22.123
I got an idea.

1:39:25.042 --> 1:39:27.003
Whoa.

1:39:28.546 --> 1:39:29.964
No.

1:39:29.964 --> 1:39:32.133
No, no, no, no. No, Jason, no.

1:39:32.133 --> 1:39:33.259
Please, Santa.

1:39:33.259 --> 1:39:36.262
I don't want you to die.

1:39:39.348 --> 1:39:41.058
Jason, let's slow this down.

1:39:41.058 --> 1:39:42.560
What are you doing?

1:39:42.560 --> 1:39:45.855
I've lived longer
than any man should ever live.

1:39:45.855 --> 1:39:48.566
He's pretty much dead.
What the hell is happening?

1:39:48.566 --> 1:39:50.651
- You don't need to burn money.
- Okay. More. Yeah.

1:39:50.651 --> 1:39:54.113
You can't die, Santa.
You have to get up.

1:39:54.113 --> 1:39:56.657
I think I used up
all my Christmas magic.

1:39:57.658 --> 1:39:59.285
Sorry.

1:40:01.329 --> 1:40:05.082
I'm s... I'm sorry I can't
give you what you asked for.

1:40:06.667 --> 1:40:08.961
Take that. Take that.

1:40:08.961 --> 1:40:10.504
But you did.

1:40:13.257 --> 1:40:15.593
Santa, please don't die.

1:40:15.593 --> 1:40:18.137
Wake up. Wake up.

1:40:18.137 --> 1:40:20.806
We need to get him
close to the fire.

1:40:20.806 --> 1:40:22.683
Jason.

1:40:23.434 --> 1:40:25.394
Just wake up.

1:40:26.437 --> 1:40:27.813
Please.

1:40:27.813 --> 1:40:29.690
No.

1:40:34.028 --> 1:40:37.281
Oh, I am so, so sorry.

1:40:42.203 --> 1:40:44.914
- This man...

1:40:45.748 --> 1:40:49.585
This brave, brave man,
whoever he was...

1:40:49.585 --> 1:40:50.878
He's Santa.

1:40:50.878 --> 1:40:53.130
The real Santa. He is.

1:40:53.130 --> 1:40:56.217
And I still believe in him.

1:40:57.051 --> 1:40:59.720
I'll always believe in you,
Santa.

1:41:04.350 --> 1:41:06.310
I believe in him, too.

1:41:09.313 --> 1:41:12.149
He saved Trudy.

1:41:12.149 --> 1:41:14.402
He saved our family.

1:41:16.362 --> 1:41:18.698
What's realer than that?

1:41:22.660 --> 1:41:24.453
Then maybe...

1:41:26.956 --> 1:41:29.083
I believe in him, too.

1:41:29.917 --> 1:41:31.460
So do I.

1:41:32.503 --> 1:41:35.840
Oh, shit.

1:41:35.840 --> 1:41:37.967
I guess...

1:41:37.967 --> 1:41:40.052
I guess I do, too.

1:41:40.052 --> 1:41:41.887
Fuck me.

1:41:41.887 --> 1:41:43.681
I believe, too.

1:41:54.108 --> 1:41:55.651
Oh, my God.

1:41:55.651 --> 1:41:56.819
Santa!

1:42:01.824 --> 1:42:03.367
You...

1:42:05.119 --> 1:42:07.163
You were dead.

1:42:07.955 --> 1:42:10.541
Christmas magic.

1:42:10.541 --> 1:42:13.169
I still don't really
understand...

1:42:13.169 --> 1:42:15.129
how it works.

1:42:20.760 --> 1:42:22.678
Thank you.

1:42:22.678 --> 1:42:24.722
I don't know
how we can ever repay you.

1:42:24.722 --> 1:42:26.891
Well, you brought me back
from the dead,

1:42:26.891 --> 1:42:28.476
so we'll call it even.

1:42:29.643 --> 1:42:30.853
Even?

1:42:30.853 --> 1:42:33.522
We just burned
half a million dollars.

1:42:34.357 --> 1:42:35.983
- Look, Santa!
- Hmm?

1:42:35.983 --> 1:42:37.360
Look who came.

1:42:44.533 --> 1:42:48.079
Now you show up, huh?

1:42:48.079 --> 1:42:49.538
You leave me here to die,

1:42:49.538 --> 1:42:51.791
come back after
all the work's done, huh?

1:42:51.791 --> 1:42:54.543
You know what? I should make
you guys into a stew

1:42:54.543 --> 1:42:56.796
and feed you to the elves!

1:42:58.756 --> 1:43:03.511
Yes, Blitzen!
Yes, I'm talking to you!

1:43:03.511 --> 1:43:05.638
You, too, Prancer.

1:43:11.018 --> 1:43:13.062
You got my sack.

1:43:13.062 --> 1:43:17.358
My spare... You went home
and you got my spare sack?

1:43:19.235 --> 1:43:21.987
Oh, God, I can't stay mad
at you guys.

1:43:21.987 --> 1:43:23.572
I...

1:43:23.572 --> 1:43:27.952
Aw. I can't. I can't.

1:43:27.952 --> 1:43:30.704
Aw.

1:43:31.747 --> 1:43:33.874
Aw.

1:43:44.760 --> 1:43:46.303
Hello, beautiful.

1:43:46.303 --> 1:43:48.222
Skullcrusher!

1:44:01.235 --> 1:44:02.903
Guess this is goodbye.

1:44:02.903 --> 1:44:04.363
I got to go.

1:44:05.239 --> 1:44:07.366
Do you have to?

1:44:10.661 --> 1:44:12.830
It's Christmas Eve,
and there's a lot of...

1:44:12.830 --> 1:44:14.540
boys and girls on the nice list

1:44:14.540 --> 1:44:16.959
that want their presents,
you know?

1:44:19.086 --> 1:44:20.754
Thank you.

1:44:21.755 --> 1:44:23.340
For what?

1:44:23.340 --> 1:44:25.009
For believing in me.

1:44:25.009 --> 1:44:28.345
For reminding me
that Christmas still matters.

1:44:29.930 --> 1:44:32.391
And that I still...

1:44:32.391 --> 1:44:34.768
matter.

1:44:36.312 --> 1:44:38.481
You gave me
my "ho, ho, ho" back.

1:44:48.365 --> 1:44:50.701
All right. Get out of here.

1:44:54.413 --> 1:44:57.333
Merry Christmas!

1:44:59.877 --> 1:45:01.128
Hyah!

1:45:01.128 --> 1:45:04.507
Now, Dasher! Now, Dancer!

1:45:04.507 --> 1:45:06.634
Now, Prancer and Vixen!

1:45:06.634 --> 1:45:10.137
On, Comet! On, Cupid!

1:45:10.137 --> 1:45:13.140
On, Donner and Blitzen!

1:45:13.140 --> 1:45:16.727
Come on, you beautiful bastards!

1:45:16.727 --> 1:45:20.105
We've got some work to do!

1:45:20.105 --> 1:45:23.150
Hyah!

1:45:23.150 --> 1:45:25.861
Ho, ho, ho!

1:45:25.861 --> 1:45:29.073
Merry Christmas!

1:46:57.369 --> 1:46:59.538
Hey, yo!
What's Gucci, squad fam?

1:46:59.538 --> 1:47:02.625
It's the Bert Locker,
living the dream.

1:47:02.625 --> 1:47:04.710
You know what? See this guy?
Dead as hell.

1:47:04.710 --> 1:47:06.503
Santa's real, all right?

1:47:06.503 --> 1:47:08.380
Don't end up
on the naughty list.

1:47:08.380 --> 1:47:09.632
Do better.

1:47:09.632 --> 1:47:11.759
Bert Lightstone out.
