01:53.855 --> 01:55.815
Pretty windy out

02:05.885 --> 02:07.880
That better not be the one
where you blow people up

02:07.895 --> 02:09.854
It's not, Mom

02:14.845 --> 02:16.870
Dad, look what I can do

02:17.800 --> 02:18.900
I've been practicing

02:23.820 --> 02:24.885
That's spectacular, kiddo

02:24.900 --> 02:26.825
Cool

02:28.870 --> 02:30.835
You're inside out

02:31.870 --> 02:33.870
Oh... I knew that

02:34.820 --> 02:35.890
Doesn't work for you?

02:37.830 --> 02:39.850
Can't believe you taught him that

02:39.900 --> 02:42.850
I didn't... He did it on his own

02:44.825 --> 02:46.845
Charlie, did you brush your teeth?

02:46.855 --> 02:48.835
- Yes
- Charlie...

02:48.840 --> 02:49.860
I brushed them

02:49.870 --> 02:50.860
Let me see

02:50.870 --> 02:51.860
Look at this, Con...

02:51.870 --> 02:53.845
Let's go. I'm serious

02:53.897 --> 02:56.843
You're driving me bonkers, Mom...

02:57.864 --> 02:58.863
Let's go

02:58.874 --> 03:00.860
Con, remember when we
were gonna buy Omnidel

03:00.861 --> 03:02.811
you said no?

03:02.835 --> 03:03.878
You remember what
the price was?

03:04.808 --> 03:06.825
1.50 $

03:06.875 --> 03:08.848
Close. 61 $

03:08.859 --> 03:09.852
I'll do it, Mom

03:09.862 --> 03:11.811
No, I'm gonna do it

03:11.822 --> 03:13.825
You know what it's
going for now, Con?

03:13.836 --> 03:15.812
- Say, "e"
- Eeeee

03:15.863 --> 03:16.892
Guess, Con

03:17.803 --> 03:19.822
Edward, I don't know, all right?

03:19.873 --> 03:21.846
All right, now rinse

03:21.857 --> 03:22.876
74 $

03:22.887 --> 03:25.803
Really rinse. And pee

03:25.864 --> 03:27.863
I should've bought it. Shit

03:28.864 --> 03:30.827
So buy some

03:30.838 --> 03:32.848
Too late, Con. Too late

03:32.881 --> 03:34.858
Lift the seat, honey

03:38.892 --> 03:40.895
Don't forget to put it down!

03:43.806 --> 03:44.882
When you finish...

03:47.879 --> 03:50.813
Do you really need all that stuff?

03:50.823 --> 03:53.886
Mom... no one wears these dorky hats

03:54.820 --> 03:56.810
Well, you do, and you're not a dork

03:56.811 --> 03:57.863
How do I look?

03:57.874 --> 03:59.820
Very handsome

04:01.807 --> 04:03.884
Love you... Ok. Come on, let's go!

04:04.855 --> 04:07.801
Jesus!

04:07.841 --> 04:08.848
Come on

04:10.812 --> 04:11.868
Maybe you shouldn't go in today

04:11.869 --> 04:13.831
I promised I'd do that
stuff for the auction...

04:13.862 --> 04:15.848
And someone's got
a birthday coming up

04:15.859 --> 04:17.896
Latrell Sprewell jersey, Mom

04:18.836 --> 04:19.849
Don't forget

04:19.889 --> 04:21.819
He's on the Yankees, right?

04:21.829 --> 04:22.856
Mom...

04:22.886 --> 04:25.829
You're driving me bonkers

04:25.840 --> 04:27.856
You're driving him bonkers

04:32.824 --> 04:33.844
Jesus...

04:34.848 --> 04:35.850
it's a holiday there

04:35.861 --> 04:36.874
Well, I'll just keep talking

04:36.885 --> 04:39.814
No, no, that's ok.
But in order to pick up...

06:07.851 --> 06:08.867
Taxi!

06:09.807 --> 06:10.806
Shit!

06:11.891 --> 06:13.817
Taxi!

06:14.865 --> 06:16.898
Taxi. Taxi!

06:52.815 --> 06:54.812
Oh... Shit!

06:55.850 --> 06:56.897
I'm so sorry!

06:56.898 --> 06:59.848
- Oh, putanne! Mes bouquins!
- I'm so sorry

06:59.856 --> 07:01.846
Putanne! Mes bouquins!

07:02.883 --> 07:03.899
I'm sorry

07:04.890 --> 07:06.842
I'll get your things

07:11.874 --> 07:13.851
Aw, shit!

07:17.801 --> 07:19.850
Taxi! Taxi!

07:19.861 --> 07:21.838
My books! Putanne!...

07:34.886 --> 07:37.852
I need a taxi!
Could you help me get a taxi?

07:37.856 --> 07:38.856
Ok

07:39.857 --> 07:40.876
I'll watch your books

07:40.877 --> 07:42.847
- Thanks
- Thank you

07:45.834 --> 07:47.860
Hey. Hey!

07:50.858 --> 07:51.877
Hey!

08:04.866 --> 08:06.812
Bad day for taxis

08:06.853 --> 08:08.823
It's this horrible wind

08:08.826 --> 08:10.883
Yeah. You shot down
there like a bullet!

08:11.853 --> 08:13.873
If you flapped your arms,
you'd be home by now

08:13.884 --> 08:16.800
I'll remember that next time

08:18.807 --> 08:19.860
That's not good

08:20.811 --> 08:20.873
I know

08:20.884 --> 08:24.877
Listen, that's me up there...
the flower pot

08:26.862 --> 08:28.898
I get you a band-aid, ok?

08:32.876 --> 08:35.818
Hold on to something.
Don't blow away

08:37.869 --> 08:41.859
Or... you can come on
up and clean it off, no?

08:42.860 --> 08:43.895
Come on!

08:44.890 --> 08:47.860
I'm not an ax murderer. I promise

09:00.805 --> 09:01.851
Oh, shit

09:02.859 --> 09:04.829
Fucking elevator

09:04.879 --> 09:06.839
Ne marche pas jamais cet ascenseur!

09:06.879 --> 09:08.829
Ascenseur de merde!

09:10.896 --> 09:12.842
Allez! One more!

09:33.889 --> 09:35.818
Pardon the mess

09:36.875 --> 09:38.808
You a writer?

09:39.856 --> 09:41.832
I'm a book dealer

09:44.850 --> 09:47.842
Bathroom's right
down there, on the left

09:50.834 --> 09:51.886
Go ahead

09:51.887 --> 09:53.877
There's a medicine cabinet

09:54.847 --> 09:57.841
You can sneak a peak
at my prescriptions

11:05.815 --> 11:06.851
Hello

11:17.806 --> 11:19.802
I made you some tea

11:19.803 --> 11:20.842
Thank you

11:22.816 --> 11:23.846
Do you box?

11:23.867 --> 11:26.877
I used to... when I was young

11:29.820 --> 11:30.886
This is an amazing place

11:32.847 --> 11:34.817
Yeah, but it's not mine

11:34.828 --> 11:35.834
No?

11:35.838 --> 11:37.810
The owner is a friend, a sculptor

11:37.811 --> 11:40.814
and he's living in Paris,
so... that's cool

11:40.815 --> 11:42.858
We can stay here, me and my books

11:47.832 --> 11:50.825
I... can I use your phone?

11:50.826 --> 11:51.839
I have to call home

11:51.843 --> 11:54.812
Oh, sure, sure. There's
a phone just behind you

11:54.815 --> 11:55.866
Thank you

12:01.857 --> 12:03.877
Gloria? Hi, it's me

12:04.817 --> 12:05.834
Good, good

12:05.874 --> 12:07.824
How's Charlie?

12:07.884 --> 12:10.874
Hi, honey. How was
your day at school?

12:10.885 --> 12:12.898
Yeah? What was the best part?

12:14.845 --> 12:17.865
Guess what. Can you believe
that mommy missed her train?

12:25.803 --> 12:26.820
Ice

12:26.870 --> 12:28.893
About an hour

12:31.803 --> 12:33.820
You should start your homework

12:33.880 --> 12:36.887
No. I promise to tell you
all about it when I see you

12:37.801 --> 12:38.871
I love you. Bye

12:40.804 --> 12:42.804
That was my son Charlie

12:42.845 --> 12:45.847
He's 8. He'll be 9 next week

12:45.848 --> 12:48.888
I'm Paul Martel.
I'll be 28 in July

12:50.815 --> 12:51.879
I'm Constance

12:52.819 --> 12:54.842
And I'm late. I have to go

12:55.819 --> 12:58.825
Before you go, take your book... no?

12:59.806 --> 13:03.872
Oh, no, I... I couldn't. I don't...

13:03.884 --> 13:05.843
Sure, you can

13:05.844 --> 13:07.830
A souvenir

13:07.871 --> 13:09.800
Go down there

13:09.811 --> 13:11.804
You know, like before

13:11.834 --> 13:12.878
Ok

13:21.822 --> 13:22.851
Keep going...

13:23.802 --> 13:24.861
Stop!

13:24.892 --> 13:26.849
Now right

13:26.899 --> 13:28.859
No. Right

13:30.826 --> 13:34.842
Ok, now... the second
shelf from the top...

13:34.873 --> 13:37.820
Take the fourth one
from the left

13:37.867 --> 13:38.890
Got it?

13:39.881 --> 13:41.831
Think so

13:41.834 --> 13:43.867
Open to page 23

13:51.872 --> 13:53.874
"Drink wine"

13:53.875 --> 13:55.898
This is life eternal

13:56.809 --> 13:57.889
"This, all that youth"

13:57.890 --> 13:59.868
will give to you

13:59.879 --> 14:01.887
"It is the season for wine"

14:01.888 --> 14:04.836
roses, and drunken friends

14:04.876 --> 14:06.897
"Be happy for this moment

14:06.898 --> 14:08.809
This moment..."

14:08.820 --> 14:10.880
is your life"

14:19.811 --> 14:20.867
I have to go

14:20.868 --> 14:22.814
Thank you

14:23.805 --> 14:24.865
Can you find your way out?

14:24.868 --> 14:25.892
I hope so

14:28.876 --> 14:30.845
That's my bedroom

14:33.843 --> 14:36.863
It was nice meeting you, Constance

14:37.893 --> 14:41.813
Hey, come back if you need more
books or... medical attention

15:14.830 --> 15:15.810
A perfect 10 there!

15:15.830 --> 15:17.897
Oh, my! Did you see that?

15:20.851 --> 15:21.857
Hey, Glo, hey

15:23.861 --> 15:25.838
That wouldn't be
the TV on, would it?

15:25.878 --> 15:27.871
I was just turning it off

15:28.802 --> 15:29.838
Sure you were

15:36.813 --> 15:37.856
The wind knocked me down today, Glo

15:37.859 --> 15:41.869
Oh, yeah? You all right?
Do you need anything?

15:43.820 --> 15:44.857
Gross!

15:44.897 --> 15:48.843
- Were you in a fight?
- No, just fell over

15:48.851 --> 15:49.863
Does it hurt?

15:49.884 --> 15:50.877
A little bit

15:50.878 --> 15:52.826
Cool!

15:52.858 --> 15:53.857
Where are you going?

15:53.868 --> 15:55.831
To get the camera!

15:55.851 --> 15:57.861
- Try this
- Thank you

15:59.802 --> 16:01.801
What do you need a camera for?

16:01.802 --> 16:03.888
It's for school.
We're doing blood and stuff

16:04.821 --> 16:07.835
Ok, now look like it really hurts

16:07.846 --> 16:08.899
- Ready?
- Yep

16:11.896 --> 16:13.882
This'll be great

16:14.813 --> 16:15.872
The wind blew her down...

16:15.873 --> 16:18.799
She bled and everything

16:18.800 --> 16:19.899
Everybody's hats blew off

16:20.800 --> 16:21.873
Look who's the worid photographer

16:21.874 --> 16:22.827
You ok?

16:22.831 --> 16:24.893
Yeah... It took me
down like an old lady

16:24.894 --> 16:27.804
- Honey...
- It's humiliating

16:27.808 --> 16:29.854
Dad, look at the pictures

16:30.875 --> 16:33.861
At least we got the evidence.
Anyone we can sue?

16:33.864 --> 16:34.878
No

16:35.829 --> 16:37.875
There was this nice
guy who helped me

16:37.876 --> 16:40.842
It was like this, Dad. It was a twister

16:43.823 --> 16:44.879
Dad, look!

16:45.840 --> 16:48.853
It was like this. This is a tornado

16:49.803 --> 16:53.853
He lived around there. He got me
some Band-Aids and put me in a taxi

16:55.801 --> 16:56.850
Is he good-looking?

17:00.801 --> 17:01.844
I feel sick

17:01.895 --> 17:03.857
Did you do your homework, Charlie?

17:03.858 --> 17:06.820
I can't. I don't know how to do it

17:06.862 --> 17:08.830
Well, come on. I'll help you

17:08.832 --> 17:10.808
You can help me with mine

17:11.819 --> 17:13.882
Did you get his name? This guy?

17:14.833 --> 17:16.848
You can send him a bottle a wine

17:17.869 --> 17:19.832
Cheap wine

17:35.818 --> 17:37.885
Con, stand there a second.
Con, wait a minute...

17:39.802 --> 17:41.868
Just stay there a second. I'm just
trying to figure out how to do the...

17:43.852 --> 17:45.882
The thing I can't
figure out is the...

17:45.893 --> 17:47.845
zoom thing here

17:47.886 --> 17:50.880
There it is. Ok, hold on. Stay there

17:50.883 --> 17:53.873
The zooming thingie... zooming in

17:56.897 --> 17:59.800
Stay there. No, come on. I'm just
trying to figure this thing out

17:59.801 --> 18:00.887
I want to see if it focuses...

18:01.878 --> 18:03.877
Hold on. Come here

18:06.811 --> 18:08.804
Cool. Very cool

18:08.845 --> 18:10.808
So beautiful

18:10.819 --> 18:13.802
If you only knew... Look at you

18:13.812 --> 18:15.818
God, what a beauty

18:24.880 --> 18:26.830
Something the matter?

18:29.847 --> 18:30.866
Nothing

18:31.837 --> 18:32.877
Nothing at all

18:32.881 --> 18:34.833
Good

18:34.884 --> 18:36.834
Come here

18:50.839 --> 18:52.892
- This is really good
- No, it isn't. Go away

18:52.896 --> 18:54.886
- Come here
- This is major

18:59.857 --> 19:01.836
I think it really is zooming in

19:01.847 --> 19:02.876
I found the zoom

19:02.887 --> 19:04.820
Found it

19:05.801 --> 19:06.857
Dad!

19:07.868 --> 19:08.832
Mom!

19:08.833 --> 19:10.801
Shit! Ok...

19:10.805 --> 19:12.874
I can't sleep!

19:12.885 --> 19:15.857
- That camera...
- Jesus!

19:17.822 --> 19:20.842
I'll be back. I'll be back...
Don't fall asleep

19:21.853 --> 19:23.802
It works!

19:28.827 --> 19:30.850
Mom, are you nuts?

19:30.854 --> 19:32.874
You forgot my lunch

19:32.877 --> 19:33.893
I did not

19:33.894 --> 19:36.856
It's by the door. Come with me

19:36.878 --> 19:38.897
What are you chew...
what are you chewing?

19:38.898 --> 19:39.884
Nothing

19:40.818 --> 19:41.868
Spit that out. What is that?

19:45.850 --> 19:46.891
That's lovely

19:47.812 --> 19:48.829
- Mom?
- Yes?

19:48.832 --> 19:50.869
I don't want to be a dumb bunny

19:50.872 --> 19:52.852
Honey, it's a play

19:52.862 --> 19:54.829
There's lots of other bunnies

19:54.839 --> 19:56.825
It would be cool to be a bunny

19:56.826 --> 19:59.816
- You're bonkers, Mom
- That's what you tell me

19:59.833 --> 20:01.803
- Love you
- Love you, too. What's that?

20:01.804 --> 20:03.897
Oh. Thank you

20:08.827 --> 20:09.846
Bye

21:22.865 --> 21:23.885
Shit

22:14.850 --> 22:16.803
Hi, this is Paul Martel

22:16.814 --> 22:19.817
Leave a message after
the beep. Thanks.

22:21.821 --> 22:23.828
Hello? Hello?

22:23.841 --> 22:24.827
Hello?

22:24.828 --> 22:25.861
- Hello
- Hello!

22:25.865 --> 22:27.834
You're... you're there

22:28.835 --> 22:29.882
This is Connie Sumner

22:29.883 --> 22:32.821
The one from the really windy day

22:32.822 --> 22:33.888
Oh, that one!

22:35.859 --> 22:37.859
How's the knee? Did you ice it?

22:37.893 --> 22:40.869
Yes, I iced it and
I elevated it and...

22:41.820 --> 22:44.850
you name it, I did it,
and it's much better and I...

22:44.853 --> 22:47.837
And I... I just wanted to call and
I wanted to thank you and...

22:47.860 --> 22:49.823
I wanted to ask for your address

22:49.824 --> 22:50.861
because I wanted to
send you a bottle of...

22:50.871 --> 22:52.863
- Where are you?
- What?

22:52.864 --> 22:55.831
I said where are you?

22:57.892 --> 22:59.808
I'm in Grand Central

22:59.852 --> 23:01.861
It's really hard to hear you

23:01.864 --> 23:03.809
Come and see me

23:03.812 --> 23:04.825
What?

23:04.826 --> 23:06.805
Yeah, take a break

23:06.866 --> 23:08.839
I'll make you some coffee

23:11.806 --> 23:12.849
Coffee...

23:18.820 --> 23:20.810
Ok

23:20.811 --> 23:21.870
Ok

23:22.821 --> 23:23.867
See you. Bye

23:23.888 --> 23:25.820
Fuck

23:36.836 --> 23:39.822
No permanent damage, I see

23:42.896 --> 23:45.826
We take Medicaid, Blue Cross...

23:45.876 --> 23:47.886
I'm uninsured

23:48.847 --> 23:51.824
No, I'm afraid we don't
take charity cases here

23:56.881 --> 23:58.817
It was a joke

24:07.809 --> 24:08.865
Oh, look at this...

24:08.866 --> 24:10.832
Jack London

24:10.852 --> 24:12.838
First edition of "White Fang"

24:12.839 --> 24:15.815
In the original dust jacket.
And you know what?

24:15.816 --> 24:17.819
I got it for a buck & 50

24:17.830 --> 24:19.826
What's it worth?

24:19.897 --> 24:22.817
About 4,000 times more!

24:25.871 --> 24:27.830
Those are in French

24:28.821 --> 24:29.894
I took it in school

24:29.895 --> 24:34.811
"Tu veux enlever ton manteau?"

24:35.852 --> 24:37.898
Do I want to take off something?

24:38.859 --> 24:41.852
Your coat

24:42.802 --> 24:44.846
Would you like to
take off your coat?

24:44.849 --> 24:46.866
Yes, my coat...

24:47.856 --> 24:48.882
Thank you

24:57.831 --> 25:00.874
But I can't stay very long.
I have some errands I have to run

25:02.848 --> 25:04.885
- I'll get the coffee
- Ok

25:11.889 --> 25:13.838
Shit

25:26.897 --> 25:28.840
It's in Braille

25:29.841 --> 25:30.837
Braille

25:30.877 --> 25:33.843
No, no. Braille. He was French

25:35.814 --> 25:36.864
Close your eyes

25:36.898 --> 25:38.821
What?

25:38.871 --> 25:40.825
Close your eyes

25:54.883 --> 25:58.810
"My mother makes me chicken"

26:00.897 --> 26:04.866
"Her chicken makes me cough"

26:05.888 --> 26:09.804
"I wish that when she made it"

26:09.835 --> 26:12.851
"she took the feathers off"

26:17.866 --> 26:19.845
It doesn't say that

26:29.873 --> 26:31.853
I had better go

26:31.854 --> 26:34.843
I got to go

26:39.821 --> 26:41.848
Take care. Don't fall

26:41.868 --> 26:43.861
Thanks for the coffee

26:44.872 --> 26:46.831
You didn't drink it

26:59.867 --> 27:01.806
Hi

27:03.827 --> 27:04.827
Lindsay, hi

27:04.867 --> 27:06.817
Connie...

27:06.837 --> 27:08.857
- Let me buzz him
- Thanks

27:11.821 --> 27:13.887
Hey, what a surprise

27:14.848 --> 27:15.824
Look at you!

27:15.825 --> 27:17.804
- Hi, Bill
- Hi, Connie

27:17.805 --> 27:18.805
Am I interrupting?

27:18.815 --> 27:19.878
- No, no
- I was just leaving

27:19.879 --> 27:22.842
All right, I'll... I'll get you
the budget for those trucks later

27:22.845 --> 27:23.865
All right. Thanks

27:23.866 --> 27:24.895
Would you like a coffee?

27:25.806 --> 27:27.829
No, thank you

27:32.880 --> 27:36.862
That's nice

27:37.827 --> 27:38.877
You know, I didn't know
you were coming in today

27:38.878 --> 27:40.833
I could've given you a ride

27:40.844 --> 27:42.877
You're freezing. What is that?

27:42.888 --> 27:46.841
Well, I was around the corner,
and I brought you a present

27:46.861 --> 27:49.807
What's the occasiَn?

27:49.868 --> 27:51.885
Nothing. I don't know

27:52.875 --> 27:55.882
It's a medium, but
they said it runs large

27:56.856 --> 27:58.812
Look at that!

27:58.833 --> 28:00.802
You don't have to try it on

28:00.813 --> 28:02.885
I'm the boss. I can do
whatever I want

28:11.831 --> 28:12.863
What do you think?

28:14.864 --> 28:16.830
Hold on just a second

28:18.825 --> 28:19.847
Yeah?

28:20.838 --> 28:23.895
Oh, all right, but
hold the other calls

28:24.882 --> 28:26.842
You're busy. I'll go

28:26.882 --> 28:29.815
- I'll go
- No. Sit. Sit. Sit

28:29.819 --> 28:30.852
Hello, Henry...

28:30.853 --> 28:33.823
Yeah, so what is this
suspensiَn problem?

28:33.833 --> 28:35.863
No, I never received it

28:37.823 --> 28:39.873
Well, all right.
Well, get it to me

28:40.897 --> 28:42.890
Henry, this... No,
it's not good enough

28:42.891 --> 28:45.833
I'm sitting here with 200
trucks that I can't use

28:45.884 --> 28:47.803
All right. Well, set up a meeting

28:47.804 --> 28:49.861
Yeah, and I want
Frank Burnbaum there

28:50.801 --> 28:51.865
'Cause I don't feel
good about this guy

28:51.866 --> 28:54.835
When I tell someone to do
something, I want it done

28:54.882 --> 28:56.864
I'm sure you will

28:59.802 --> 29:00.899
Anyway...

29:01.899 --> 29:04.848
So, what else you up to?

29:05.860 --> 29:07.849
- Auction
- Yeah?

29:07.850 --> 29:08.882
Who'd you hit on?

29:11.857 --> 29:14.813
The usual suspects...

29:15.897 --> 29:17.847
Who?

29:19.854 --> 29:22.874
- Bob Gaylord
- Bob?

29:24.815 --> 29:27.858
You get a pledge out of Bob, they
should send you to the middle east

29:34.833 --> 29:35.892
So, tell me...

29:37.883 --> 29:39.813
What?

29:41.803 --> 29:42.886
What do you think?

29:42.890 --> 29:44.870
It's a keeper!

29:45.867 --> 29:46.897
Jeez

30:49.820 --> 30:50.810
Hello

30:50.820 --> 30:51.870
Hello

30:57.804 --> 30:58.898
Here I am again

30:59.828 --> 31:01.818
I brought muffins

31:02.838 --> 31:04.808
"Tu veux enlever ton manteau?"

31:16.856 --> 31:17.899
What is this music?

31:18.800 --> 31:19.867
You like it?

31:20.807 --> 31:21.817
Yes

31:23.837 --> 31:24.893
Do you want to dance?

31:26.827 --> 31:27.851
Now?

31:27.861 --> 31:29.813
Yeah

31:30.855 --> 31:31.898
Ok

31:35.828 --> 31:37.864
I have to warn you,
I tend to lead

31:37.865 --> 31:40.808
Of course. You are American

31:51.830 --> 31:53.846
You've done this before

31:53.857 --> 31:55.823
What?

31:57.877 --> 32:00.880
How many girlfriends
have you had?

32:03.808 --> 32:06.817
Two

32:06.878 --> 32:08.881
Really?

32:09.832 --> 32:11.871
Would I lie to you?

32:12.802 --> 32:13.882
I don't know, would you?

32:32.871 --> 32:35.804
Your eyes are amazing,
you know that?

32:35.805 --> 32:37.881
You should never shut them.
Not even at night

32:38.842 --> 32:41.818
You should learn to sleep
with your eyes open

32:44.805 --> 32:46.802
I'll work on that

32:46.882 --> 32:48.842
Will you?

32:52.813 --> 32:53.839
Hang on

32:58.807 --> 33:00.810
I think this is a mistake

33:03.801 --> 33:04.888
There's no such thing as a mistake

33:04.891 --> 33:07.870
There's what you do
and what you don't do

33:09.801 --> 33:11.805
I can't do this

33:24.816 --> 33:25.896
I forgot my coat

35:41.867 --> 35:43.847
I can't. I can't

35:43.857 --> 35:45.857
What? What's wrong?

35:45.868 --> 35:47.861
I can't. I don't know
how to do this

35:47.871 --> 35:49.884
- This is wrong
- Hit me

35:49.885 --> 35:51.821
I don't want to

35:51.832 --> 35:52.884
Hit me

35:58.866 --> 36:00.845
Hit me

37:35.812 --> 37:36.831
Say, Ed!

37:36.832 --> 37:38.865
- Hey, Bob!
- Haven't seen you in a while

37:38.873 --> 37:41.829
No. No. I've been
working late this week

37:41.890 --> 37:43.843
How's the boy?

37:43.893 --> 37:45.868
He's a pistol of a kid.
He's gonna have a birthday

37:45.869 --> 37:46.873
- Really? How old?
- 9

37:47.814 --> 37:50.807
So any major armed robberies?

37:50.817 --> 37:52.820
No. No, not this week

37:52.881 --> 37:53.893
Speaking of armed robberies...

37:54.804 --> 37:55.844
you better watch out for Connie

37:55.845 --> 37:57.854
She's gonna get you to
sign over your mortgage

37:57.865 --> 37:59.827
What do you mean?

37:59.838 --> 38:02.814
Did she try to hit
on you for some money?

38:02.815 --> 38:03.615
No

38:03.809 --> 38:05.828
I thought she talked
to you about this...

38:05.829 --> 38:07.878
School auction... or whatever

38:07.889 --> 38:09.809
Not me

38:09.829 --> 38:11.869
But I've been out of town. Maybe
she talked to Maggie about it

38:13.883 --> 38:16.816
Yeah. Yeah, I guess I got it wrong

38:16.827 --> 38:18.853
Anyway, we owe you a dinner

38:20.844 --> 38:21.863
Yeah

38:31.805 --> 38:32.855
He's out

38:35.862 --> 38:37.818
Can I get you anything?

38:37.849 --> 38:40.825
No. No, I'm fine. Thanks

38:43.883 --> 38:45.839
Tough day?

38:46.800 --> 38:47.873
Not really

38:49.803 --> 38:51.839
How about you?
How was your day?

38:52.854 --> 38:54.827
It was good

38:54.837 --> 38:56.883
You know, the usual stuff

39:03.888 --> 39:05.868
Sure you don't want anything?

39:06.848 --> 39:07.885
No

39:09.819 --> 39:10.829
Con?

39:10.859 --> 39:11.885
Yeah?

39:12.896 --> 39:14.883
Do you love me?

39:15.853 --> 39:17.893
Of course I love you

39:19.813 --> 39:21.842
What a silly question

39:22.873 --> 39:27.803
I guess... I'm just feeling silly

39:32.814 --> 39:34.814
I'll be up in a minute

39:34.855 --> 39:35.864
Ok

39:37.818 --> 39:38.828
Sorry

41:43.828 --> 41:44.881
What are we doing here?

41:46.868 --> 41:48.825
Having lunch

41:50.862 --> 41:52.864
I shouldn't be doing this

41:52.865 --> 41:55.802
What, you shouldn't be having lunch?

41:55.812 --> 41:56.892
Not with you

41:57.863 --> 41:59.846
I think we should leave

42:05.834 --> 42:06.870
Listen...

42:07.810 --> 42:10.810
see those guys over
there paying the check?

42:12.828 --> 42:14.811
- Yes
- Ok

42:14.814 --> 42:17.847
If the guy on the right pays,
we'll leave right now

42:17.848 --> 42:21.825
If the guy on the left pays, we stay

42:23.895 --> 42:26.808
And... I kiss you

42:26.879 --> 42:28.868
No. No

42:28.879 --> 42:31.839
No. No. No

42:34.850 --> 42:37.826
Hey, you're kidding me, man

42:40.817 --> 42:41.873
I win

42:45.838 --> 42:46.857
No

42:46.858 --> 42:48.810
- C'est la vie!
- No

42:48.811 --> 42:51.855
Don't do it. Don't

44:06.803 --> 44:07.803
Room for two?

44:07.806 --> 44:08.855
Of course

44:45.890 --> 44:47.843
Nice music

44:47.844 --> 44:49.800
What is it?

44:50.824 --> 44:52.857
It's...

44:52.867 --> 44:55.837
African, I think

44:56.828 --> 44:57.877
I like it

45:24.888 --> 45:26.846
Here

45:58.841 --> 46:01.888
Let's go to bed. Come on

46:01.891 --> 46:03.885
Stay here with me

46:03.895 --> 46:04.875
I'm cold

46:04.876 --> 46:06.841
- Stay here
- I'm cold

46:11.806 --> 46:12.828
Stay here with me

46:12.829 --> 46:13.829
I'm cold

46:13.839 --> 46:15.842
Come on, let's go

46:43.826 --> 46:44.889
How about lunch today?

46:45.839 --> 46:46.879
You free?

46:47.849 --> 46:51.879
I have all this fund-raiser
stuff Auction things to pick up

46:51.883 --> 46:53.852
We can do an early one, if you want

46:53.863 --> 46:55.823
How about 12:00?

46:55.834 --> 46:57.803
12:00?

46:57.814 --> 46:58.840
Yeah

47:02.811 --> 47:04.854
Will I be hungry at 12:00?

47:12.845 --> 47:14.825
We could go in together

47:14.835 --> 47:16.825
I'll wait for you

47:17.876 --> 47:20.828
I'm not gonna be ready
to go for at least an hour

47:20.829 --> 47:22.826
That's all right. I'll wait

47:36.814 --> 47:38.824
- Oh, shit
- What?

47:38.825 --> 47:40.808
I just remembered...

47:41.838 --> 47:44.894
I have a facial at 12:30
at Georgiana's today

47:46.829 --> 47:47.875
Oh, well...

47:49.816 --> 47:51.885
You gotta stay beautiful, right?

47:55.893 --> 47:58.829
Georgiana's?

48:00.817 --> 48:02.899
Waste of money

48:19.815 --> 48:22.821
Yeah, Manhattan

48:22.832 --> 48:25.882
Beauty salon called Georgina

48:27.896 --> 48:31.836
Yeah, right. Yes. Yes.
Georgiana's. That's right

48:33.877 --> 48:35.820
Thank you

48:41.888 --> 48:46.807
Hello, I'm calling to confirm
an appointment today, 12:30

48:47.841 --> 48:51.841
Sumner. Connie Sumner.
S-u-m-n-e-r

48:55.859 --> 49:00.832
Could she... could she
be down for another time?

49:05.803 --> 49:06.896
No, thank you

49:28.882 --> 49:30.895
Connie!

49:30.896 --> 49:33.879
Connie! Connie...

49:33.882 --> 49:36.843
- Tracy! Hi!
- Hi

49:36.846 --> 49:37.892
I was gonna call you

49:37.893 --> 49:40.862
That's what they all say when
I call about bunny costumes

49:40.864 --> 49:43.800
You know Sally
from Planned Parenthood?

49:43.801 --> 49:44.810
Hi. It's been a while

49:44.821 --> 49:45.881
Well, too long. Too long

49:45.882 --> 49:47.823
You look amazing

49:47.826 --> 49:48.844
So where you headed?

49:48.845 --> 49:50.847
Oh, I was just going to...

49:50.858 --> 49:52.864
go look at some window
shades for the kitchen

49:52.875 --> 49:54.838
Well, we're gonna go
and have coffee

49:54.848 --> 49:56.817
Why don't you join us?

49:56.818 --> 49:58.848
Oh, I'm gonna be late

49:58.849 --> 50:00.861
For window shades?

50:01.842 --> 50:02.857
Come on!

50:02.860 --> 50:04.882
Ok. Ok

50:09.863 --> 50:11.876
Hi, how are you?

50:17.877 --> 50:20.817
I'm just going to make
a phone call

50:20.828 --> 50:21.881
Sure

50:22.861 --> 50:25.858
She could have
used my cell phone

50:30.845 --> 50:31.881
Hi, it's me

50:32.822 --> 50:34.826
You're not gonna believe this...

50:34.876 --> 50:36.845
I'm at the cafe
around the corner

50:36.856 --> 50:39.898
Why do you have to introduce me
as Sally from Planned Parenthood?

50:40.806 --> 50:40.896
What do you mean?

50:41.807 --> 50:44.826
Well, it makes it sound like I'm
in New York handing out condoms

50:44.830 --> 50:46.807
I'm stuck here

50:48.871 --> 50:50.830
Will you wait for me?

50:50.891 --> 50:52.821
Wait for me

50:53.851 --> 50:55.871
with the redhead.
Just can't take it

50:55.881 --> 50:57.861
She has it the next
morning... all the time

50:57.872 --> 50:58.898
Had to call Gloria, remind her...

50:58.899 --> 51:01.855
to pick up the dry cleaning
when she gets Charlie

51:01.865 --> 51:03.885
Never a dull moment

51:03.896 --> 51:06.842
No. Charlie is so adorable

51:07.802 --> 51:08.839
Thank you

51:24.881 --> 51:26.878
I can't eat

51:29.831 --> 51:30.828
I'll have a coffee

51:30.838 --> 51:32.898
Well, I guess I'll have coffee, too

51:34.812 --> 51:36.861
Excuse me again. Ladies room

51:40.836 --> 51:42.839
God, she looks good

51:42.840 --> 51:43.895
Do you think she's had work?

51:44.806 --> 51:46.880
Why would she have work?
She still looks gorgeous

51:46.887 --> 51:47.889
That's when they're having it now

51:48.800 --> 51:50.803
Early, before it all goes to shit

52:05.829 --> 52:07.822
I have friends out there

52:14.853 --> 52:16.875
You take me to the best places

52:17.816 --> 52:18.865
Wait

52:19.807 --> 52:20.883
Let me...

52:24.887 --> 52:27.840
She's not like that.
She's really nice

52:27.861 --> 52:30.804
Of course she is.
That makes it worse

52:30.814 --> 52:32.844
She is nice, and she's sweet...

52:32.855 --> 52:34.841
and her ass is in exactly
the same place it was

52:34.842 --> 52:36.828
when she was in college

52:42.872 --> 52:44.846
Are you taking tennis?

52:44.856 --> 52:48.845
Oh, I wouldn't call
what I do taking tennis

52:50.863 --> 52:52.808
- Ok
- There you are

52:52.811 --> 52:53.852
I was beginning to worry

52:53.854 --> 52:55.854
No, it's fine. I'm fine

52:55.864 --> 52:58.854
We thought you were
abducted by that heartthrob

52:59.864 --> 53:01.827
What heartthrob?

53:01.828 --> 53:03.814
You didn't see him at the counter?

53:03.817 --> 53:04.827
He was gorgeous

53:05.885 --> 53:07.861
I miss everything

53:07.862 --> 53:09.817
Your button's undone

53:09.821 --> 53:11.845
Oh, thank you

53:16.816 --> 53:17.899
That's him

53:26.857 --> 53:28.844
I guess I could see the appeal

53:28.847 --> 53:31.853
Well, if he looked at me twice,
I would be on my back in a second

53:31.857 --> 53:32.831
Oh, you would not

53:32.841 --> 53:33.897
Oh, I would so. Why not?

53:34.808 --> 53:36.897
Well, a couple of reasons.
Adam for one, your kids for another

53:37.801 --> 53:39.877
Well, you know, Tracy, they
wouldn't have to know about it

53:40.845 --> 53:42.844
It could be just something
that I did for myself

53:42.845 --> 53:45.872
You know, to... broaden my horizons

53:45.882 --> 53:47.865
It'd be like taking a pottery class

53:47.886 --> 53:50.885
Having an affair is nothing
like taking a pottery class

53:50.886 --> 53:53.826
- Could be
- No. It would start out like that

53:53.830 --> 53:55.877
And then, something would happen

53:55.887 --> 53:58.890
Someone finds out,
or someone falls in love...

53:58.894 --> 54:00.889
and it ends disastrously

54:02.827 --> 54:04.890
They always end disastrously

54:13.895 --> 54:15.818
Tracy!

54:16.859 --> 54:18.835
No

54:18.846 --> 54:19.885
When?

54:20.876 --> 54:22.852
It was a long time ago

54:23.813 --> 54:27.805
And it's the one thing in my
life I would undo if I could

54:35.807 --> 54:37.890
Did you just fuck me
across the street?

54:39.804 --> 54:40.864
I did

54:41.855 --> 54:44.877
You know, we could end this
now, and no one would get hurt

54:44.881 --> 54:46.842
Yeah?

54:46.852 --> 54:51.819
I think if we ended
this now... I'd get hurt

54:51.862 --> 54:54.838
So, no matter what,
someone get's hurt?

54:54.839 --> 54:56.802
Maybe not

54:56.853 --> 54:58.873
Maybe we'll get tired of each other

54:59.823 --> 55:01.849
God, I hope I get tired of you

55:06.847 --> 55:08.834
You're in my mind

55:08.864 --> 55:13.891
You're the only thing in my
mind when I wake up every morning

55:15.818 --> 55:18.831
You're in my brain
before I even open my eyes

55:18.845 --> 55:20.815
What do you think of?

55:20.825 --> 55:21.888
It depends

55:21.889 --> 55:24.849
If it's a day when I don't know
if I'm going to get to see you

55:24.852 --> 55:30.863
I'm anxious... thinking of excuses
to come into the city and see you

55:34.870 --> 55:36.879
And the days you know we meet?

55:36.890 --> 55:38.847
On those days...

55:39.887 --> 55:41.837
I'm...

55:42.807 --> 55:43.844
calm...

55:43.848 --> 55:45.891
and... hating myself

55:49.802 --> 55:50.874
Oh, God

55:55.892 --> 55:58.852
This is what we have over here

55:58.883 --> 56:02.845
And... I'll have it ready
for you this afternoon

56:02.849 --> 56:04.825
That happens all the time...

56:05.833 --> 56:07.856
Ed, what's up? It sounded important

56:09.854 --> 56:12.820
I've heard you're talking
with Dunbar and Brinks...

56:12.831 --> 56:13.893
a few other companies

56:14.804 --> 56:16.820
Oh, yeah? Where'd you hear that?

56:17.868 --> 56:20.897
Well, look, I mean, I
suppose they could be...

56:20.898 --> 56:22.888
wooing me,
if that's what you mean

56:22.892 --> 56:26.815
Apparently a lot of people
are wooing you these days

56:26.846 --> 56:28.841
Now, who's wooing who?

56:28.842 --> 56:30.898
Wait.
What are you talking about?

56:31.809 --> 56:33.815
So I talked
to some people. So what?

56:33.816 --> 56:35.843
This is about loyalty, Bill

56:35.883 --> 56:37.853
I'm letting you go

56:37.857 --> 56:40.849
You'll have my
recommendation, if you need it

56:43.821 --> 56:45.833
I have a family, Ed

56:45.884 --> 56:48.833
You had a family here

56:48.834 --> 56:52.849
Wait. Wait a minute. You're
telling me... about family?

56:53.803 --> 56:56.804
Well, you don't know the
first goddamn thing about it!

57:00.886 --> 57:03.858
Why don't you take a look at
your own fucking family, Ed?

57:03.873 --> 57:06.830
Take a goddamn look at that

57:24.892 --> 57:26.875
- Hi, Ed
- Frank

57:29.869 --> 57:32.838
Thanks for coming
on such short notice

57:32.889 --> 57:35.829
This is personal.
It's not business...

57:36.819 --> 57:37.849
So you think about it

57:37.853 --> 57:39.886
I don't know if you're gonna
want to get involved with this..

57:39.887 --> 57:42.827
But I need someone I can trust

57:42.837 --> 57:44.856
I want you to follow somebody

57:45.857 --> 57:46.887
I...

57:48.857 --> 57:51.810
I want you to follow my wife

58:02.812 --> 58:03.825
It's burning, Mom

58:03.836 --> 58:04.836
What?

58:04.859 --> 58:07.805
It's burning. The chicken

58:07.806 --> 58:08.866
Oh, shit!

58:11.833 --> 58:12.875
Shit

58:21.827 --> 58:23.800
It's boiling, Mom

58:23.801 --> 58:24.857
It's boiling!

58:24.858 --> 58:25.874
Thank you

58:29.885 --> 58:31.898
Watch it. Watch it.
Watch it. Watch it

58:44.883 --> 58:47.836
Chicken's a little dry. I'm sorry

58:47.867 --> 58:48.870
It's fine

58:53.894 --> 58:56.844
I have to go to Chicago tomorrow

58:58.828 --> 58:59.867
For how long?

58:59.868 --> 59:01.871
Not long. Probably just a night

59:01.872 --> 59:03.848
What time's your flight?

59:03.879 --> 59:05.838
8:00

59:06.862 --> 59:08.822
A. M.

59:11.839 --> 59:14.849
Diane Dryer's son is
marrying Amy Lynne's daughter

59:14.853 --> 59:16.876
I'm never getting married

59:17.816 --> 59:18.816
Why not?

59:18.847 --> 59:20.829
I hate giris

59:22.857 --> 59:24.860
Well, you might change your mind

59:24.861 --> 59:26.850
That happens sometimes

59:26.861 --> 59:28.808
I won't

59:32.878 --> 59:33.868
What?

59:34.862 --> 59:36.872
I fired Bill Stone today

59:37.842 --> 59:39.821
So that's what's bothering you

59:39.825 --> 59:41.811
Nothing's bothering me

59:41.812 --> 59:43.811
Why did you fire him?

59:45.813 --> 59:46.846
He's not accountable

59:46.856 --> 59:49.803
What's accountable?

59:49.813 --> 59:51.843
Is it, like, people who eat people?

59:52.803 --> 59:54.887
No, no... that's a cannibal

59:57.841 --> 01:00:00.820
Anyway, I can't
trust him anymore

01:00:00.898 --> 01:00:03.845
So if you run into
Dolly, you'll know

01:01:18.856 --> 01:01:22.816
Well, how are you gonna clean up the
area so pedestrians can get through?

01:01:40.801 --> 01:01:41.817
What?!

01:01:41.858 --> 01:01:42.898
I can't believe you!

01:01:43.858 --> 01:01:45.822
What are you doing?

01:02:11.881 --> 01:02:13.807
Shit!

01:02:13.808 --> 01:02:14.808
Charlie...!

01:02:15.842 --> 01:02:16.868
Shit!

01:02:32.800 --> 01:02:33.800
Come on!

01:02:54.886 --> 01:02:57.809
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry

01:02:57.819 --> 01:02:58.849
I', sorry

01:02:58.859 --> 01:03:00.819
Honey, are you ok?

01:03:00.830 --> 01:03:02.822
You must have been so worried?

01:03:02.823 --> 01:03:03.851
- Stop, Mom
- What?

01:03:03.852 --> 01:03:05.829
- People can we see
- Ok

01:03:28.856 --> 01:03:30.803
Hi, this is Paul Martel

01:03:30.813 --> 01:03:31.892
Leave a message after
the beep. Thanks

01:03:32.803 --> 01:03:33.812
Mom?

01:03:33.823 --> 01:03:35.803
Honey...

01:03:35.873 --> 01:03:37.860
You're supposed to be in bed

01:03:38.820 --> 01:03:39.893
You're crying, Mom

01:03:39.894 --> 01:03:41.874
Oh, honey...

01:03:42.844 --> 01:03:44.893
mommy's just a little sad,
that's all

01:03:45.824 --> 01:03:47.827
Come on, I'll take you to bed

01:03:47.855 --> 01:03:49.857
Let's get you into bed

01:03:49.868 --> 01:03:51.805
Don't be sad, Mom

01:03:51.835 --> 01:03:53.831
Dad will be home tomorrow

01:04:02.826 --> 01:04:04.863
His name is Paul Martel

01:04:09.867 --> 01:04:13.813
He lives at 433 Mercer Street,
apartment 3

01:04:13.897 --> 01:04:16.816
She sees him during the day

01:04:17.854 --> 01:04:19.857
Usually goes around lunchtime

01:04:20.818 --> 01:04:22.891
Stays about 2 hours, maybe 3

01:04:36.833 --> 01:04:38.870
They go to the movies?

01:04:39.830 --> 01:04:42.803
They did that day. Otherwise,
they're in his apartment

01:05:55.874 --> 01:05:57.844
Pick up!

01:06:20.830 --> 01:06:21.863
Hey. Hey, lady!

01:06:22.864 --> 01:06:24.810
Forgot your keys

01:07:05.875 --> 01:07:06.852
Wait!

01:07:08.855 --> 01:07:10.824
Who is she?! Who is she?!

01:07:10.855 --> 01:07:11.822
No!

01:07:11.832 --> 01:07:12.822
Calm down!

01:07:13.849 --> 01:07:14.879
Why are you doing this?

01:07:18.806 --> 01:07:20.846
How many are there? 5? 10?

01:07:22.827 --> 01:07:24.803
God, what am I?

01:07:24.814 --> 01:07:26.833
The Monday one. What,
did I get my day wrong?

01:07:26.850 --> 01:07:28.856
She's just a friend, ok?

01:07:28.867 --> 01:07:30.816
Just a friend

01:07:31.818 --> 01:07:33.817
You're a fuckin' liar

01:07:33.821 --> 01:07:35.867
Me? I'm the liar?

01:07:35.878 --> 01:07:37.858
I can't do this anymore

01:07:40.885 --> 01:07:42.894
Fine. Go back to
your suburban carpool

01:07:42.895 --> 01:07:44.819
Your tennis dress on your...

01:07:44.829 --> 01:07:46.828
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

01:07:46.899 --> 01:07:48.825
Fuck you!

01:07:48.886 --> 01:07:50.809
That'll make you happy

01:07:50.810 --> 01:07:51.856
Fuck you!

01:07:58.894 --> 01:07:59.837
No

01:07:59.847 --> 01:08:01.813
No, I can't

01:08:01.824 --> 01:08:03.821
Paul, it's over

01:08:05.888 --> 01:08:06.895
I can't!

01:08:13.862 --> 01:08:15.871
I hate you. I hate you

01:08:15.872 --> 01:08:16.832
I know

01:08:16.841 --> 01:08:18.845
Stop it. I can't

01:08:39.805 --> 01:08:40.854
You gonna fuck me?

01:08:40.856 --> 01:08:41.861
You want it?

01:08:41.872 --> 01:08:42.884
Yeah, I want you to

01:08:42.895 --> 01:08:43.888
Say it

01:08:43.898 --> 01:08:45.837
- I want you to fuck me
- Say it

01:08:45.849 --> 01:08:47.832
I want you to fuck me

01:10:39.887 --> 01:10:41.827
Oh, thank you

01:10:41.837 --> 01:10:42.870
Thank you very much

01:10:42.881 --> 01:10:45.811
Thank you very much, indeed

01:11:06.866 --> 01:11:07.869
Yes?

01:11:09.890 --> 01:11:11.800
You're Paul Martel?

01:11:11.804 --> 01:11:12.830
Yes

01:11:13.831 --> 01:11:14.873
How old are you?

01:11:17.881 --> 01:11:19.801
Who are you?

01:11:20.801 --> 01:11:21.864
Edward Sumner

01:11:23.865 --> 01:11:25.858
Connie's husband

01:11:32.833 --> 01:11:34.822
May I...

01:11:34.853 --> 01:11:35.895
may I come in?

01:11:37.890 --> 01:11:40.813
Yeah. Sure

01:12:08.866 --> 01:12:10.846
Would you like a drink?

01:12:10.866 --> 01:12:12.843
Yeah. Why not?

01:12:23.828 --> 01:12:27.801
I have scotch,
vodka... prune juice

01:12:27.825 --> 01:12:29.811
Vodka

01:12:30.865 --> 01:12:32.811
Is it cold?

01:12:33.822 --> 01:12:34.851
Yeah

01:12:36.802 --> 01:12:38.815
I keep it in the freezer

01:12:38.826 --> 01:12:41.826
So do I. At home

01:12:58.865 --> 01:13:01.831
So tell me, how did you...

01:13:01.842 --> 01:13:03.801
meet my wife?

01:13:04.862 --> 01:13:06.848
By accident

01:13:06.889 --> 01:13:08.861
On the street

01:13:09.803 --> 01:13:11.855
There was a wind storm,
she hooked her knee...

01:13:11.859 --> 01:13:13.869
Oh... you're him

01:13:14.890 --> 01:13:16.846
She told you about that?

01:13:16.847 --> 01:13:17.859
Yes

01:13:23.841 --> 01:13:24.877
How's it going?

01:13:27.844 --> 01:13:28.840
Fine

01:13:29.811 --> 01:13:30.881
Fine. I mean, ok

01:13:31.815 --> 01:13:33.847
This is... this is where you meet?

01:13:33.848 --> 01:13:34.888
Yes

01:13:35.889 --> 01:13:37.834
She likes it?

01:13:37.835 --> 01:13:39.872
Well, I guess.
She never complained

01:13:43.833 --> 01:13:46.899
Do you stay in all the time,
or do you go out, too?

01:13:48.840 --> 01:13:51.830
It depends. Sometimes,
yes, we go out

01:13:51.833 --> 01:13:52.890
She likes that?

01:13:52.894 --> 01:13:54.827
She...

01:13:54.897 --> 01:13:57.810
likes this neighborhood?

01:13:57.813 --> 01:13:58.843
Oh, yeah

01:13:58.844 --> 01:14:00.894
More exciting than
the suburbs, I guess

01:14:05.828 --> 01:14:09.811
Do you know that we have
been married 11 years?

01:14:10.802 --> 01:14:11.875
We have a son

01:14:13.849 --> 01:14:15.842
Yeah, she told me

01:14:18.833 --> 01:14:19.859
More?

01:14:20.850 --> 01:14:22.809
Yes, please

01:14:35.821 --> 01:14:37.888
He's the reason
that we left the city

01:14:38.858 --> 01:14:41.858
Connie thought it
would be better for him

01:14:41.862 --> 01:14:43.871
Oh. She told me it was your idea

01:14:46.826 --> 01:14:49.876
You... talk about me?

01:15:08.898 --> 01:15:10.865
Lot of books...

01:15:10.895 --> 01:15:13.888
Yeah. Lot of buying and selling

01:15:54.823 --> 01:15:56.826
Didn't know it did that

01:16:02.834 --> 01:16:03.893
Where did you get this?

01:16:04.814 --> 01:16:05.844
It was a gift

01:16:06.804 --> 01:16:07.843
From her

01:16:20.879 --> 01:16:22.862
Why would she do that?

01:16:22.866 --> 01:16:24.829
I don't know...

01:16:25.819 --> 01:16:28.890
Maybe... maybe she just
wanted to buy me something

01:16:33.817 --> 01:16:36.830
She didn't buy this for you.
I gave it to her

01:16:44.841 --> 01:16:45.870
I gave it to her...

01:16:46.802 --> 01:16:47.831
What?

01:16:48.899 --> 01:16:50.841
I gave it to her

01:16:50.852 --> 01:16:53.808
I gave... I'm s...

01:16:55.836 --> 01:16:59.826
I'm feeling sick. I can't...

01:16:59.836 --> 01:17:01.806
You want some water?

01:17:02.846 --> 01:17:05.859
I'm feeling sick. I'm...

01:17:06.830 --> 01:17:07.867
I don't...

01:17:11.838 --> 01:17:14.804
I'm... I'm not well

01:17:14.845 --> 01:17:16.807
I'm not feeling well

01:17:21.828 --> 01:17:23.805
I'm not...

01:17:23.855 --> 01:17:25.821
I'm not feeling...

01:18:23.845 --> 01:18:24.895
God!

01:21:02.888 --> 01:21:04.801
Hi, this is Paul Martel

01:21:04.822 --> 01:21:07.818
Leave a message after
the beep. Thanks.

01:21:07.849 --> 01:21:09.825
Hi, it's me

01:21:09.865 --> 01:21:10.869
Listen...

01:21:12.856 --> 01:21:16.802
I don't like saying this
to your machine, but...

01:21:17.833 --> 01:21:19.890
I have to end this

01:21:23.800 --> 01:21:26.880
I just... I can't do it anymore

01:21:26.884 --> 01:21:29.867
I can't live like this

01:21:29.878 --> 01:21:34.810
I'm so tired of lying
and hurting my family

01:21:35.821 --> 01:21:36.891
I'm sorry

01:21:37.832 --> 01:21:42.815
I hope... I
don't know what I hope

01:21:43.806 --> 01:21:44.892
I'm... I'm sorry

01:22:52.896 --> 01:22:55.809
Messages erased

01:23:09.831 --> 01:23:10.847
Does that pinch?

01:23:10.858 --> 01:23:12.810
No

01:23:12.822 --> 01:23:14.807
Do you know your solo?

01:23:14.808 --> 01:23:14.888
- Yep
- Yeah?

01:23:14.889 --> 01:23:17.838
Can I hear it?

01:24:46.851 --> 01:24:47.839
You need a hand?

01:24:47.840 --> 01:24:48.640
No

01:24:48.801 --> 01:24:49.850
No, I'm fine

01:24:49.872 --> 01:24:51.824
Thanks

01:25:13.804 --> 01:25:16.820
focus on the journey

01:25:16.831 --> 01:25:18.847
for there will be those

01:25:18.858 --> 01:25:22.841
who will love to see you fall

01:25:56.858 --> 01:25:59.848
Catch a star from the sky

01:25:59.859 --> 01:26:02.875
Let it sparkle in your eye

01:26:02.886 --> 01:26:05.863
Set your sights above the crowd

01:26:05.873 --> 01:26:08.892
Walk tall, dream loud

01:26:09.803 --> 01:26:11.897
Take your mark and go

01:26:12.807 --> 01:26:14.833
focus on the journey

01:26:14.844 --> 01:26:15.843
Where were you?

01:26:16.877 --> 01:26:17.884
You ok?

01:26:17.887 --> 01:26:21.828
Who will love to see you fall

01:26:21.838 --> 01:26:24.857
All along the way

01:26:24.868 --> 01:26:27.867
hiding on the sidelines

01:26:27.878 --> 01:26:30.825
they must be the ones

01:26:30.835 --> 01:26:33.891
who have never dreamed at all

01:26:34.802 --> 01:26:37.848
Catch a star from the sky

01:26:37.859 --> 01:26:40.822
Let it sparkle in your eye

01:26:40.833 --> 01:26:43.856
Set your sights above the crowd

01:26:43.867 --> 01:26:46.883
Walk tall, dream loud

01:26:51.898 --> 01:26:54.821
What's the sense in dreaming

01:26:54.831 --> 01:26:57.814
if your dreams are small?

01:26:57.825 --> 01:27:00.838
What's the sense in walking

01:27:00.848 --> 01:27:03.808
if you don't walk tall?

01:27:03.819 --> 01:27:06.851
Dream loud

01:27:52.887 --> 01:27:55.816
You were spectacular.
You know that?

01:27:56.841 --> 01:27:59.800
- Wasn't he great, Edward?
- Great

01:27:59.821 --> 01:28:01.886
He was great, great

01:28:02.866 --> 01:28:04.821
Really great

01:28:04.888 --> 01:28:06.814
I have to help clean up

01:28:06.815 --> 01:28:08.898
I'll come and kiss you good
night later when I get home, ok?

01:28:17.873 --> 01:28:18.896
Sorry, Ed

01:28:19.807 --> 01:28:21.806
It looks like I nailed you

01:28:23.847 --> 01:28:25.877
It's all right, Jerry. It's ok

01:28:31.885 --> 01:28:34.821
You'd better check to
see if this is gonna open

01:28:34.831 --> 01:28:35.871
No, no, this is... this is fine

01:28:35.875 --> 01:28:38.841
It's nothing.
It's nothing. It's fine

01:28:42.862 --> 01:28:44.812
Did he dent you, Dad?

01:28:44.863 --> 01:28:47.802
Yeah. Yes, he did. Yes, he did

01:28:47.813 --> 01:28:49.849
Can we call the cops, Dad?

01:28:51.867 --> 01:28:53.835
You sure you don't
wanna check the trunk?

01:28:53.836 --> 01:28:55.827
- We'll deal with it tomorrow
- It'll just take a second

01:28:55.828 --> 01:28:56.827
No!

01:32:02.883 --> 01:32:04.820
Oh, my God

01:32:04.830 --> 01:32:05.870
Charlie...

01:32:05.880 --> 01:32:08.859
look at your dad and
tell me what's wrong

01:32:10.881 --> 01:32:12.823
What?

01:32:13.881 --> 01:32:15.837
His shoes!

01:32:15.888 --> 01:32:17.894
They're different colors

01:32:25.845 --> 01:32:27.811
Honey, you look awful

01:32:27.872 --> 01:32:29.835
What happened last night?
Did you sleep?

01:32:29.836 --> 01:32:31.872
I got up and looked for you

01:32:31.873 --> 01:32:33.886
Oh, I just...

01:32:35.816 --> 01:32:37.813
got some air

01:32:37.823 --> 01:32:38.890
Are you ok?

01:32:40.810 --> 01:32:41.874
Yeah

01:32:53.845 --> 01:32:55.874
Do you like it here, Connie?

01:32:55.875 --> 01:32:57.815
What?

01:32:58.815 --> 01:32:59.842
Of course I like it here

01:32:59.846 --> 01:33:00.869
'Cause we don't have to stay here

01:33:00.870 --> 01:33:03.819
We can... we can
move back to the city

01:33:04.869 --> 01:33:07.875
Honey, what has gotten into you?

01:33:09.880 --> 01:33:11.840
Are you ok?

01:33:12.810 --> 01:33:14.867
Yeah, yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine

01:33:17.834 --> 01:33:18.880
Are you ok?

01:33:18.891 --> 01:33:21.810
I'm fine

01:33:21.861 --> 01:33:25.834
Everybody's fine, and
we're not moving anywhere

01:34:07.873 --> 01:34:09.865
The cops are here, Mom

01:34:11.823 --> 01:34:12.870
What do they want?

01:34:12.871 --> 01:34:14.866
I'm sure it's nothing

01:34:21.847 --> 01:34:23.867
N.Y.P.D., Mom

01:34:25.845 --> 01:34:26.834
Hello

01:34:26.845 --> 01:34:27.861
- Mrs. Sumner
- Yes

01:34:27.871 --> 01:34:29.807
Yeah, I'm detective Dean

01:34:29.808 --> 01:34:30.857
This is detective Mirojnick...

01:34:30.868 --> 01:34:32.813
New York City Police Department

01:34:32.814 --> 01:34:33.844
Did something happen?
Is something wrong?

01:34:33.845 --> 01:34:34.878
Oh, no, no. No...

01:34:34.879 --> 01:34:36.899
do you know a Paul Martel?

01:34:37.859 --> 01:34:41.842
Yes, not very well. Why?

01:34:41.853 --> 01:34:43.809
Do you know where he is?

01:34:44.880 --> 01:34:46.840
No.

01:34:48.880 --> 01:34:51.800
At home, I would imagine

01:34:51.820 --> 01:34:52.877
Do you know where he lives?

01:34:53.807 --> 01:34:55.827
Soho, isn't it?

01:34:56.818 --> 01:34:59.835
Your name and number
were found on his desk

01:35:01.835 --> 01:35:02.887
Has he done something wrong?

01:35:02.888 --> 01:35:06.822
Well, we don't know. He's been
reported missing by his family

01:35:06.845 --> 01:35:08.815
His wife doesn't know where he is

01:35:12.803 --> 01:35:13.886
I didn't know he was married

01:35:15.803 --> 01:35:16.853
Separated

01:35:21.824 --> 01:35:22.890
When did you see him last?

01:35:25.810 --> 01:35:27.874
I don't know... It's hard to say

01:35:29.894 --> 01:35:31.871
he's a book dealer. I...

01:35:31.881 --> 01:35:34.897
I barely know him at all. I was
going to buy some books from him

01:35:35.818 --> 01:35:35.894
And did you?

01:35:36.805 --> 01:35:38.855
No, not yet

01:35:41.856 --> 01:35:44.848
Has something happened to him?
I mean, do you think he's all right?

01:35:44.852 --> 01:35:46.849
It's hard to say at this point

01:35:47.859 --> 01:35:48.899
We're workin' on it

01:35:50.880 --> 01:35:53.820
Anyway, thanks...
thanks for your time

01:35:53.860 --> 01:35:54.879
Thank you

01:35:54.890 --> 01:35:57.876
I like these snow glass things

01:35:57.877 --> 01:35:59.803
My boy has some of these

01:35:59.814 --> 01:36:01.833
If you hear from Mr. Martel,
let us know

01:36:01.834 --> 01:36:02.870
Certainly

01:36:30.851 --> 01:36:33.818
Dad! The cops came
to our house today

01:36:35.828 --> 01:36:37.854
Cops? What did they want?

01:36:41.889 --> 01:36:45.895
Someone's missing... and they
have to check everyone, you know

01:36:50.866 --> 01:36:51.889
Who was it?

01:36:52.890 --> 01:36:54.866
Honey, sit up straight

01:36:57.887 --> 01:36:58.893
Who was it?

01:36:58.894 --> 01:37:00.803
I don't think you know him

01:37:00.814 --> 01:37:02.873
He's... he sells books

01:37:03.864 --> 01:37:05.851
I forget where I met him

01:37:06.861 --> 01:37:08.854
Was it a bad guy, Mom?

01:37:11.801 --> 01:37:14.817
So what did they... why
did they wanna talk to you?

01:37:14.885 --> 01:37:17.891
I guess... he had my name and number

01:37:19.822 --> 01:37:21.852
Why... why would
he have your number?

01:37:23.819 --> 01:37:25.819
I think I bought a book from him

01:37:37.864 --> 01:37:39.807
Be careful. Be careful

01:37:39.808 --> 01:37:40.818
Hey, Charlie

01:37:40.891 --> 01:37:42.814
Hi, darlin'

01:37:42.825 --> 01:37:44.841
Oh, I wish you lived closer

01:37:48.839 --> 01:37:52.878
Lord, bless this food to our
use and us to thy service...

01:37:53.823 --> 01:37:57.825
and help us to be ever
mindful of the needs of others

01:37:57.829 --> 01:37:57.876
Amen

01:37:57.886 --> 01:38:00.823
Amen

01:38:00.833 --> 01:38:02.843
Edward!

01:38:12.828 --> 01:38:13.881
All right!

01:38:22.836 --> 01:38:24.885
I have a... I have a story
you don't know about Edward

01:38:24.896 --> 01:38:26.845
He was at the club...

01:39:14.831 --> 01:39:16.814
Hello, Mrs. Sumner

01:39:16.825 --> 01:39:18.878
Sorry to bother you on the weekend

01:39:18.888 --> 01:39:20.877
I'm... detective Dean

01:39:20.885 --> 01:39:22.864
This is detective Mirojnick, N.Y.P.D.

01:39:22.865 --> 01:39:23.835
Ok

01:39:23.845 --> 01:39:26.804
We were hoping to talk
to you for a few minutes

01:39:26.822 --> 01:39:28.835
Sure

01:39:28.846 --> 01:39:30.862
Charlie, we're gonna go up
on the porch for a minute

01:39:30.863 --> 01:39:31.852
Can I come?

01:39:31.863 --> 01:39:33.859
No, sweetheart.
You stay out here

01:39:33.880 --> 01:39:35.863
Play with Poppy.
We'll be right back

01:39:37.803 --> 01:39:38.850
I don't know if
your wife mentioned

01:39:38.851 --> 01:39:40.863
we was here about a
week and a half ago...

01:39:40.873 --> 01:39:42.826
about Paul Martel

01:39:42.837 --> 01:39:44.866
Yeah, that was the...
the man who was missing

01:39:44.867 --> 01:39:46.891
Well, he's not missing anymore

01:39:47.804 --> 01:39:49.880
His body was discovered last weekend

01:39:50.871 --> 01:39:53.821
God, that's... that's terrible

01:39:55.812 --> 01:39:56.875
Oh, my God

01:39:56.879 --> 01:40:01.815
Do you recall where you met
Mr. Martel, Mrs. Sumner?

01:40:02.816 --> 01:40:04.882
- I told you
- No, ma'am, you didn't

01:40:04.896 --> 01:40:06.888
I'm sorry...

01:40:07.818 --> 01:40:09.819
I can't remember

01:40:09.870 --> 01:40:11.865
A fund-raiser, I think

01:40:11.868 --> 01:40:13.830
Can you be more specific?

01:40:13.860 --> 01:40:15.827
Juilliard

01:40:17.801 --> 01:40:18.864
Juilliard

01:40:19.844 --> 01:40:20.831
The music school

01:40:21.805 --> 01:40:23.807
Yes, I know what Juilliard is

01:40:23.808 --> 01:40:25.821
Oh, of course you do. I'm sorry

01:40:25.822 --> 01:40:27.825
Were you there, too, sir?

01:40:28.885 --> 01:40:31.822
Yes, yes... I think I was

01:40:31.862 --> 01:40:34.825
Well, maybe you met Mr. Martel

01:40:35.896 --> 01:40:38.810
No, no, not that I remember

01:40:38.813 --> 01:40:39.873
Maybe you'd recognize him

01:40:41.820 --> 01:40:43.877
No, no. I never met him before

01:40:43.880 --> 01:40:46.833
- Is that him?
- Yes, yes

01:40:47.831 --> 01:40:49.834
You ever been to his apartment?

01:40:50.814 --> 01:40:51.853
No

01:40:51.864 --> 01:40:53.864
No, I... I... I hardly knew him

01:40:53.868 --> 01:40:55.897
I didn't even know why
he had my phone number

01:40:55.898 --> 01:40:57.834
Maybe he liked you

01:40:57.865 --> 01:41:00.822
Look, I think that's enough

01:41:02.872 --> 01:41:04.874
So you've never been
to his apartment

01:41:04.877 --> 01:41:08.805
Well, how 'bout, the neighborhood.
Did you hang out down there?

01:41:08.806 --> 01:41:10.882
- No
- No, not often...

01:41:10.883 --> 01:41:13.866
- ...or no, never
- Never

01:41:13.873 --> 01:41:16.813
I can't remember the
last time I was in Soho

01:41:16.814 --> 01:41:18.833
It was 4 weeks ago, actually

01:41:20.877 --> 01:41:23.853
You got a parking ticket right
in front of Martel's apartment...

01:41:23.854 --> 01:41:24.887
4 weeks ago

01:41:24.890 --> 01:41:27.807
Oh, that. Right

01:41:27.808 --> 01:41:30.864
I... had coffee with
friends at a little place

01:41:30.865 --> 01:41:31.865
I forgot

01:41:31.868 --> 01:41:35.802
- It was Tracy and Sally
- Oh, yeah. Yes. Yeah

01:41:47.820 --> 01:41:48.836
Look...

01:41:50.827 --> 01:41:53.886
my wife has told you everything
she knows. So have I. So...

01:41:54.854 --> 01:41:57.834
if you don't mind, we'd
like to get back to our son

01:41:57.837 --> 01:41:59.857
All right.

01:41:59.868 --> 01:42:02.805
Why don't I give you my card...

01:42:02.808 --> 01:42:03.861
I have your card

01:42:05.802 --> 01:42:06.818
Right

01:42:07.866 --> 01:42:09.889
- Enjoy your weekend
- You, too

01:43:05.878 --> 01:43:07.854
Sumner, please

01:43:46.849 --> 01:43:48.825
Oh, my God

01:43:49.889 --> 01:43:51.879
Hi, Connie

01:43:52.840 --> 01:43:54.836
Hi, Tracy

01:43:54.847 --> 01:43:57.873
I'm just picking up my
silk suit for tonight

01:43:59.870 --> 01:44:02.810
I was thinking of wearing the black

01:44:14.845 --> 01:44:16.818
I'm gonna give up the good row

01:44:16.819 --> 01:44:19.811
Let someone else be
gorgeous for a change

01:44:23.810 --> 01:44:26.859
So what should we bring aside
from our sparkling personalities?

01:44:31.824 --> 01:44:32.840
How we doing?

01:44:32.881 --> 01:44:34.803
Fine

01:44:34.814 --> 01:44:35.823
You need help?

01:44:35.824 --> 01:44:36.863
No

01:44:38.881 --> 01:44:43.801
The white is not cold, so I'm
gonna put it in the freezer

01:44:44.832 --> 01:44:46.898
Just remind me it's
in there, all right?

01:44:49.832 --> 01:44:51.831
Most people drink red anyway

01:44:56.840 --> 01:44:57.876
Oh, I love these things

01:44:57.886 --> 01:44:59.876
Is there anyplace
you guys haven't been?

01:44:59.877 --> 01:45:03.850
The Rosenthals
got 795 for their place

01:45:03.860 --> 01:45:05.810
In 2 days, they had 6 offers

01:45:05.811 --> 01:45:07.804
Sealed bids. That's
what everyone's doing now

01:45:07.807 --> 01:45:08.897
What do you think
this place is worth, Ed?

01:45:09.848 --> 01:45:11.847
Oh, I don't know

01:45:11.858 --> 01:45:13.878
You sell your house,
where do you go?

01:45:13.881 --> 01:45:15.854
At those prices, Tahiti

01:45:15.858 --> 01:45:16.887
Bangkok

01:45:16.898 --> 01:45:19.835
Connie, where's this one from?

01:45:29.870 --> 01:45:31.863
Fiji

01:45:32.823 --> 01:45:34.877
Oh, remember, Jeff, I asked
you to take me to Fiji?

01:45:35.867 --> 01:45:36.897
And then you took me to Hawaii?

01:45:37.807 --> 01:45:39.804
We went fishing every single day...

01:46:03.807 --> 01:46:04.883
What happened, Edward?

01:46:07.877 --> 01:46:09.874
What did you do?

01:46:11.824 --> 01:46:12.876
Did you hurt him?

01:46:17.825 --> 01:46:18.868
Edward?

01:46:19.898 --> 01:46:21.868
Did you hurt him?

01:46:24.835 --> 01:46:25.895
You did, didn't you?

01:46:26.886 --> 01:46:30.842
Oh, Jesus, Edward

01:46:32.813 --> 01:46:34.800
Talk to me

01:46:34.840 --> 01:46:36.880
Tell me what you did

01:46:36.883 --> 01:46:40.839
No, you tell me what you did

01:46:40.890 --> 01:46:43.890
How you fucked him over
and over and over...

01:46:44.801 --> 01:46:45.874
You lied to me...

01:46:45.884 --> 01:46:48.857
over and over and over...

01:46:48.858 --> 01:46:49.887
Edward, please...

01:46:49.888 --> 01:46:52.821
No, you don't talk to me now

01:46:52.822 --> 01:46:54.855
I gave everything...

01:46:55.835 --> 01:46:57.875
for this family

01:46:58.806 --> 01:46:59.852
Everything...

01:47:00.872 --> 01:47:03.859
Snd what did you do?

01:47:04.830 --> 01:47:06.823
You threw it all away...

01:47:06.833 --> 01:47:08.816
like it was nothing

01:47:08.817 --> 01:47:10.816
For what?

01:47:10.857 --> 01:47:12.870
To a fucking kid!

01:47:21.831 --> 01:47:23.834
You didn't think I'd know?

01:47:23.865 --> 01:47:25.815
I wouldn't feel it?

01:47:25.818 --> 01:47:27.848
I knew it from
the very first day

01:47:29.876 --> 01:47:31.866
Because I know you, Connie

01:47:31.869 --> 01:47:34.835
I know you, and I fuckin' hate you!

01:47:34.836 --> 01:47:37.852
I didn't want to kill him.
I wanted to kill you!

01:47:40.810 --> 01:47:42.876
Oh, my God

01:47:52.834 --> 01:47:56.827
Edward... Oh, my God

01:48:06.849 --> 01:48:08.872
Dear God

01:48:50.807 --> 01:48:53.870
Mom, look what I did

01:48:55.888 --> 01:48:58.827
Honey... that's ok

01:48:59.827 --> 01:49:00.837
That's ok

01:49:00.878 --> 01:49:02.847
I'm sorry, Mom

01:49:02.850 --> 01:49:04.815
It's an accident

01:49:04.855 --> 01:49:06.839
Everybody has accidents

01:49:06.842 --> 01:49:08.898
Why aren't you in bed, Mom?

01:49:11.886 --> 01:49:13.839
I don't know

01:49:17.813 --> 01:49:18.896
Charlie, look at me

01:49:19.857 --> 01:49:21.833
I want you to know...

01:49:21.863 --> 01:49:25.860
that I love you... more
than anything in the worid

01:49:28.814 --> 01:49:31.841
And I want you to know
that your daddy and me both...

01:49:31.855 --> 01:49:34.824
will always, always love you

01:49:34.835 --> 01:49:37.815
No matter what, hmm?

01:49:39.886 --> 01:49:42.832
- Ok?
- Ok

01:49:43.813 --> 01:49:44.852
Come on, sweetie

01:49:44.853 --> 01:49:48.895
Let's go fix up your bed
all nice and fresh, ok?

01:49:49.877 --> 01:49:51.850
All right

01:51:29.830 --> 01:51:31.860
>If you find this DO NOT OPEN
until our 25th anniversary

01:51:44.840 --> 01:51:48.820
to my beautiful wife
the best part of every day

01:53:03.810 --> 01:53:05.836
"You can come on up
and clean it off, no?"

01:53:05.847 --> 01:53:09.877
"Come on! I'm not an
ax murderer. I promise"

01:53:44.847 --> 01:53:45.874
"Thank you"

01:54:12.864 --> 01:54:14.897
What are we gonna do?

01:54:18.814 --> 01:54:20.821
I'm so scared

01:54:22.841 --> 01:54:24.851
I'll turn myself in

01:54:24.882 --> 01:54:26.818
No

01:54:28.889 --> 01:54:30.858
No

01:54:39.877 --> 01:54:42.836
No, we can get through this

01:54:43.887 --> 01:54:46.884
We'll take it one day at a time

01:54:48.834 --> 01:54:50.848
No one will know

01:54:52.828 --> 01:54:54.818
We'll know

01:55:02.849 --> 01:55:06.805
31, 3.500, 3.800, 4.000...

01:55:06.816 --> 01:55:08.825
42, 45, 4.800...

01:56:35.829 --> 01:56:37.842
We could disappear

01:56:39.862 --> 01:56:42.822
We could raise some
money, sell everything...

01:56:42.833 --> 01:56:44.862
and just leave the country

01:56:45.883 --> 01:56:47.866
"Seٌorita"

01:56:48.877 --> 01:56:50.876
Mexico

01:56:52.827 --> 01:56:53.893
Why not?

01:56:55.875 --> 01:56:57.895
We could get a little
house on the beach...

01:56:58.845 --> 01:57:00.865
Take a different name...

01:57:01.885 --> 01:57:04.820
People do it all the time

01:57:04.890 --> 01:57:06.890
What do we tell Charlie?

01:57:08.870 --> 01:57:11.870
Tell him it's an adventure

01:57:14.860 --> 01:57:16.880
We could fish all day

01:57:20.835 --> 01:57:23.840
We could learn to play the guitar...

01:57:24.880 --> 01:57:29.845
And I would serenade
you to sleep every night

01:57:30.840 --> 01:57:33.830
We'd just live the rest of
our lives on that beach...

01:57:34.820 --> 01:57:38.815
and then when we die, we
could just push out to sea

01:57:38.830 --> 01:57:40.810
What do you think?

01:57:42.830 --> 01:57:44.815
It sounds perfect
