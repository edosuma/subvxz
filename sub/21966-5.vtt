00:02.625 --> 00:05.375
(  dramatic theme playing  )

00:08.709 --> 00:10.834
CHASE:

00:08.709 --> 00:10.834
Attention Sigma-17 crew.

00:10.875 --> 00:13.792
We are now entering the last

00:10.875 --> 00:13.792
quadrant on our patrol.

00:13.834 --> 00:15.792
BLADES:

00:13.834 --> 00:15.792
Finally.

00:15.834 --> 00:18.917
I can't wait to get back

00:15.834 --> 00:18.917
on Cybertron again.

00:18.959 --> 00:21.208
All this flying makes me cranky.

00:21.250 --> 00:23.125
So, what's your excuse

00:21.250 --> 00:23.125
on the ground?

00:23.166 --> 00:25.041
I think it's beautiful

00:23.166 --> 00:25.041
out here.

00:25.083 --> 00:27.500
So mysterious and quiet.

00:27.542 --> 00:28.792
( alarms blaring )

00:28.834 --> 00:30.041
Mostly.

00:30.083 --> 00:31.792
That's the emergency channel.

00:31.834 --> 00:34.917
Blades,

00:31.834 --> 00:34.917
patch the message through.

00:34.959 --> 00:35.959
MAN ( on radio ):

00:34.959 --> 00:35.959
Damage...

00:36.000 --> 00:37.625
( beeping )

00:37.667 --> 00:38.667
Can't...

00:38.709 --> 00:41.208
Need help...

00:41.250 --> 00:43.583
We've lost contact.

00:41.250 --> 00:43.583
Call HQ.

00:43.625 --> 00:45.834
This patrol

00:43.625 --> 00:45.834
just became a rescue mission.

00:45.875 --> 00:47.917
( computer beeping )

00:45.875 --> 00:47.917
Cybertron isn't responding.

00:47.959 --> 00:50.125
We must be too far

00:47.959 --> 00:50.125
out of communications range.

00:50.166 --> 00:52.709
BOULDER:

00:50.166 --> 00:52.709
I might be able

00:50.166 --> 00:52.709
to boost the signal manually.

00:52.750 --> 00:55.250
I'd have to go outside the ship.

00:52.750 --> 00:55.250
No time.

00:55.291 --> 00:57.500
Chase, follow the coordinates

00:55.291 --> 00:57.500
of that distress call,

00:57.542 --> 00:59.875
max velocity.

00:57.542 --> 00:59.875
Affirmative, Heatwave.

00:59.917 --> 01:02.500
( electronic beeping )

01:02.542 --> 01:04.333
( engines igniting )

01:11.000 --> 01:13.250
(  heroic theme playing  )

01:17.917 --> 01:20.166
Looks like

01:17.917 --> 01:20.166
we might be too late.

01:20.208 --> 01:23.000
Chase, stay here

01:20.208 --> 01:23.000
and keep trying Cybertron HQ

01:23.041 --> 01:24.458
till you get through.

01:24.500 --> 01:26.792
Blades, bring your medi-kit

01:24.500 --> 01:26.792
for survivors.

01:26.834 --> 01:28.917
Boulder and I

01:26.834 --> 01:28.917
will stabilize their ship.

01:28.959 --> 01:31.500
CHASE:

01:28.959 --> 01:31.500
Heatwave. Our radar is detecting

01:28.959 --> 01:31.500
a strange object nearby.

01:31.542 --> 01:33.166
And getting nearer.

01:33.208 --> 01:34.667
HEATWAVE:

01:33.208 --> 01:34.667
It'll have to wait.

01:34.709 --> 01:36.041
We've got a job to do.

01:36.083 --> 01:38.667
Rescue Bots,

01:36.083 --> 01:38.667
power to the rescue.

01:38.709 --> 01:40.542

01:54.500 --> 01:56.083
( loud wailing )

01:59.792 --> 02:01.041
( hisses )

02:01.083 --> 02:03.000
Aah!

02:01.083 --> 02:03.000
Energon eater!

02:03.041 --> 02:06.083
Run!

02:03.041 --> 02:06.083
( roars )

02:06.125 --> 02:07.208
CODY:

02:06.125 --> 02:07.208
Oh, come on.

02:07.250 --> 02:09.625
You can't stop the story there.

HEATWAVE:

02:58.792 --> 03:01.208
So there we were, in space,

03:01.250 --> 03:04.500
the Energon Eater so close I

03:01.250 --> 03:04.500
could feel its stinking breath.

03:04.542 --> 03:05.500
(  suspenseful theme playing  )

03:05.542 --> 03:07.000
What happened?

03:07.041 --> 03:08.417
You were there, Blades.

03:08.458 --> 03:11.208
I'm invested

03:08.458 --> 03:11.208
in the story.

03:11.250 --> 03:13.500
Oh, boy.

03:13.542 --> 03:15.166
HEATWAVE:

03:13.542 --> 03:15.166
Back to the ship! Hurry!

03:15.208 --> 03:17.083
I never knew

03:15.208 --> 03:17.083
Energon Eaters were real.

03:17.125 --> 03:19.458
I've heard the stories,

03:17.125 --> 03:19.458
but no one's ever seen one.

03:19.500 --> 03:22.000
Or maybe they just

03:19.500 --> 03:22.000
haven't lived to tell about it.

03:22.041 --> 03:23.959
( roaring )

03:24.000 --> 03:26.375
( hisses )

03:26.417 --> 03:28.417
You two make a run for it.

03:26.417 --> 03:28.417
I'll hold this thing off.

03:28.458 --> 03:31.166
No, Heatwave!

03:28.458 --> 03:31.166
You can't!

03:31.208 --> 03:32.208
( roaring )

03:33.333 --> 03:35.417
CHASE:

03:33.333 --> 03:35.417
Quickly! Inside!

03:43.041 --> 03:46.000
Thanks for the save, Chase.

03:43.041 --> 03:46.000
Now let's get out of here.

03:46.041 --> 03:49.250
The max velocity drive

03:46.041 --> 03:49.250
requires more time to charge.

03:49.291 --> 03:50.375
Initiating cloaking shield.

03:52.125 --> 03:53.500
( roars )

03:54.917 --> 03:56.834
You think we lost it?

03:56.875 --> 03:59.000
I've heard once an Energon

03:56.875 --> 03:59.000
Eater gets your scent,

03:59.041 --> 04:00.959
it never stops hunting you.

04:01.000 --> 04:02.250
( whimpers )

04:02.291 --> 04:04.709
It is said the creatures

04:02.291 --> 04:04.709
can smell flowing Energon.

04:04.750 --> 04:07.875
So any Bot that

04:04.750 --> 04:07.875
crosses their path is dinner.

04:07.917 --> 04:08.875
( Eater bellows )

04:08.917 --> 04:10.500
Hold on to something!

04:10.542 --> 04:11.792
( all grunting )

04:11.834 --> 04:14.125
Our ship can't take

04:11.834 --> 04:14.125
many more hits like that.

04:14.166 --> 04:17.208
How long until the velocity

04:14.166 --> 04:17.208
drive is ready, Chase?

04:17.250 --> 04:18.583
( loud thud )

04:17.250 --> 04:18.583
( all grunting )

04:18.625 --> 04:20.875
At this rate of attack,

04:18.625 --> 04:20.875
too long.

04:20.917 --> 04:23.667
Ah. Can't we hide

04:20.917 --> 04:23.667
our smell somehow?

04:23.709 --> 04:26.500
A gas cloud?

04:23.709 --> 04:26.500
Lots of blankets?

04:26.542 --> 04:30.333
Stasis. If we freeze ourselves

04:26.542 --> 04:30.333
in the emergency pods,

04:30.375 --> 04:32.333
our Energon will be solid,

04:30.375 --> 04:32.333
not flowing.

04:32.375 --> 04:34.000
That thing

04:32.375 --> 04:34.000
won't be able to scent us.

04:34.041 --> 04:37.000
But our ship runs

04:34.041 --> 04:37.000
on flowing Energon too.

04:37.041 --> 04:40.000
We'd have to shut it down.

04:37.041 --> 04:40.000
Then how will we get home?

04:40.041 --> 04:41.834
I'll program the Sigma

04:40.041 --> 04:41.834
to restart

04:41.875 --> 04:43.583
when it gets

04:41.875 --> 04:43.583
a priority Prime message.

04:43.625 --> 04:45.834
Cybertron will send one

04:43.625 --> 04:45.834
as soon as we miss our check-in.

04:45.875 --> 04:47.750
Less talking.

04:45.875 --> 04:47.750
More freezing!

04:47.792 --> 04:49.333
( loud thud, roaring )

04:49.375 --> 04:51.208
CHASE:

04:49.375 --> 04:51.208
Heatwave.

04:51.250 --> 04:53.500
We have not yet answered

04:51.250 --> 04:53.500
that ship's distress call.

04:53.542 --> 04:55.458
Rescue Bots exist

04:53.542 --> 04:55.458
to provide aid,

04:55.500 --> 04:57.625
no matter how dangerous

04:55.500 --> 04:57.625
the circumstances.

04:57.667 --> 05:00.667
We won't be able to do anything

04:57.667 --> 05:00.667
if that Energon Eater gets us.

05:00.709 --> 05:02.709
(  suspenseful theme playing  )

05:04.667 --> 05:06.625
Into the stasis pods, now!

05:06.667 --> 05:08.834
Chase! That's an order!

05:21.458 --> 05:23.041
( ship powers down )

05:23.083 --> 05:25.417
( sniffing )

05:25.458 --> 05:27.208
( roars )

05:31.417 --> 05:33.959
HEATWAVE:

05:31.417 --> 05:33.959
And the next thing we knew,

05:34.000 --> 05:36.041
our craft was headed to Earth.

05:36.083 --> 05:41.041
If Optimus hadn't called us,

05:36.083 --> 05:41.041
we would have drifted in space

05:41.083 --> 05:45.625
forever, ever, ever, ever...

05:45.667 --> 05:47.333
Forever.

05:47.375 --> 05:48.959
Whoa.

05:49.000 --> 05:50.625
Best story night ever, guys.

05:50.667 --> 05:52.625
I didn't know space

05:50.667 --> 05:52.625
had vampires.

05:52.667 --> 05:53.709
Nor did I.

05:53.750 --> 05:55.792
What are vampires?

05:55.834 --> 05:58.000
They're creatures that live

05:55.834 --> 05:58.000
by sucking your blood.

05:58.041 --> 05:59.709
Uh...Energon.

05:59.750 --> 06:01.917
I know about those.

06:01.959 --> 06:05.083
They're called mosquitoes.

06:05.125 --> 06:07.875
Uh, not exactly,

06:05.125 --> 06:07.875
Boulder.

06:07.917 --> 06:11.083
Ooh, I've seen vampires

06:07.917 --> 06:11.083
on TV.

06:11.125 --> 06:14.375
Energon Eaters

06:11.125 --> 06:14.375
are way more scary.

06:14.417 --> 06:16.583
They don't

06:14.417 --> 06:16.583
brood handsomely.

06:16.625 --> 06:20.417
So, what happened to the other

06:16.625 --> 06:20.417
ship? The one that needed help?

06:20.458 --> 06:22.709
We left it behind.

06:22.750 --> 06:25.333
The one mission

06:22.750 --> 06:25.333
we did not accomplish.

06:25.375 --> 06:27.834
Some days I find it hard

06:25.375 --> 06:27.834
to call myself a Rescue Bot.

06:27.875 --> 06:29.625
( communicator beeping )

06:29.667 --> 06:31.709
CHIEF ( on communicator ):

06:29.667 --> 06:31.709
Emergency, Team.

06:31.750 --> 06:34.750
The river's flooding, and the

06:31.750 --> 06:34.750
area has to be evacuated now.

06:34.792 --> 06:36.625
Cody, I'll need your eyes

06:34.792 --> 06:36.625
in the Command Center.

06:36.667 --> 06:38.333
On my way, Dad.

Help!

06:49.417 --> 06:51.917
A little bit lower!

06:51.959 --> 06:54.500
BLADES:

06:51.959 --> 06:54.500
I can't carry

06:51.959 --> 06:54.500
that many people inside.

06:54.542 --> 06:57.625
How are we supposed

06:54.542 --> 06:57.625
to choose who to save?

06:57.667 --> 06:58.959
We don't have to.

06:59.000 --> 07:01.959
We can carpool.

07:02.000 --> 07:04.834
What are you doing?

07:02.000 --> 07:04.834
Come back! Over here!

07:07.333 --> 07:10.458
All citizens

07:07.333 --> 07:10.458
without gills and/or fins

07:10.500 --> 07:12.750
must evacuate this area

07:12.792 --> 07:16.000
Okay, folks, the river's rising

07:12.792 --> 07:16.000
and there's not much time.

07:16.041 --> 07:17.750
We'll secure your houses.

07:17.792 --> 07:20.500
Get to City Hall

07:17.792 --> 07:20.500
and take only what you need.

( crowd clamoring )

07:34.834 --> 07:37.458
(  heroic theme playing  )

07:39.333 --> 07:42.041
Get in,

07:39.333 --> 07:42.041
and don't forget to buckle up.

( relieved murmuring )

07:50.166 --> 07:53.041
( panicked screams )

07:53.083 --> 07:55.083
Unh! Help!

07:55.125 --> 07:57.542
Quick!

07:55.125 --> 07:57.542
Is anybody near the falls?

07:57.583 --> 07:59.333
Mr. Levy's

07:57.583 --> 07:59.333
about to go over!

07:59.375 --> 08:01.709
I got this.

07:59.375 --> 08:01.709
Let's move, Heatwave.

08:01.750 --> 08:03.709
HEATWAVE:

08:01.750 --> 08:03.709
Oh, you mean we got this?

08:03.750 --> 08:05.750
Doy. You're my sidekick.

08:05.792 --> 08:08.000
HEATWAVE:

08:05.792 --> 08:08.000
Your side will be

08:05.792 --> 08:08.000
the second place I kick.

08:09.792 --> 08:11.542
(  dramatic theme playing  )

08:13.750 --> 08:15.750
( grunting )

08:15.792 --> 08:18.500
( groaning )

08:18.542 --> 08:20.542
All right, gotcha.

08:20.583 --> 08:22.792
Bet you're not used to being

08:20.583 --> 08:22.792
the one getting caught, huh?

08:22.834 --> 08:24.834
Heh!

08:22.834 --> 08:24.834
Ah, just come on.

08:27.959 --> 08:30.834
Help! Help me!

08:30.875 --> 08:33.792
HEATWAVE:

08:30.875 --> 08:33.792
I got this. Cody,

08:30.875 --> 08:33.792
tell my sidekick I'm sorry.

08:33.834 --> 08:36.083
Sorry about-- Whoa!

08:40.166 --> 08:41.500
( rumbling )

08:41.542 --> 08:44.041
( grunts )

08:44.083 --> 08:46.542
( grunting )

08:55.333 --> 08:56.333
( groans )

08:58.208 --> 08:59.208
( grunting )

09:00.542 --> 09:01.875
Ohh!

09:03.583 --> 09:06.041
(  dramatic theme playing  )

09:21.959 --> 09:24.208
( grunts )

09:24.250 --> 09:25.875
( Heatwave transforms )

09:29.166 --> 09:30.291
Mrs. Neederlander?

09:31.583 --> 09:33.625
( meows )

09:33.667 --> 09:35.792
( sighs ):

09:33.667 --> 09:35.792
That was too close.

09:35.834 --> 09:38.583
All right, team. We need

09:35.834 --> 09:38.583
to set up a new water break.

09:38.625 --> 09:40.458
Most of town's flooded.

09:40.500 --> 09:42.333
Let's start cleaning up.

09:48.208 --> 09:50.208
Hey, guys.

09:48.208 --> 09:50.208
I just heard from the mayor.

09:50.250 --> 09:52.500
All the townsfolk

09:50.250 --> 09:52.500
are safe and accounted for.

09:52.542 --> 09:54.917
Finally,

09:52.542 --> 09:54.917
a little good news.

09:56.333 --> 09:58.417
Hit the showers, team.

09:58.458 --> 10:02.375
No thanks, Dad. I don't want to

09:58.458 --> 10:02.375
see any more water for awhile.

10:02.417 --> 10:04.000
You better

10:02.417 --> 10:04.000
get used to it.

10:04.041 --> 10:06.458
It'll take us weeks

10:04.041 --> 10:06.458
to clean up after that flood.

10:06.500 --> 10:09.083
And...a lot of rebuilding.

10:09.125 --> 10:11.542
( sighs ):

10:09.125 --> 10:11.542
It is unthinkable.

10:11.583 --> 10:14.333
We have failed

10:11.583 --> 10:14.333
our first mission on Earth.

10:14.375 --> 10:16.709
What are you

10:14.375 --> 10:16.709
talking about?

10:16.750 --> 10:20.542
Didn't you hear Cody?

10:16.750 --> 10:20.542
We saved everyone.

10:20.583 --> 10:22.875
This is

10:20.583 --> 10:22.875
high-five time!

10:25.458 --> 10:28.583
No one?

10:28.625 --> 10:30.583
But we were unable

10:28.625 --> 10:30.583
to stop the river

10:30.625 --> 10:32.333
from flooding the town.

10:32.375 --> 10:35.125
We can't control nature, Chase.

10:35.166 --> 10:37.208
And our job isn't over yet.

10:37.250 --> 10:40.625
It might take us some time

10:37.250 --> 10:40.625
to get the town back to normal,

10:40.667 --> 10:45.458
but we won't give up

10:40.667 --> 10:45.458
on our mission.

10:45.500 --> 10:49.291
CHASE:

10:45.500 --> 10:49.291
I repeat, Rescue Force Sigma-17

10:45.500 --> 10:49.291
to damaged transport ship,

10:49.333 --> 10:51.250
do you copy?

10:51.291 --> 10:53.959
Do you copy,

10:51.291 --> 10:53.959
transport ship?

10:54.000 --> 10:56.667
Damaged transport ship,

10:54.000 --> 10:56.667
do you copy?

10:56.709 --> 10:59.583
Uh, Chase?

10:56.709 --> 10:59.583
What are you doing?

10:59.625 --> 11:01.291
Attending

10:59.625 --> 11:01.291
to unfinished business.

11:01.333 --> 11:03.375
Please respond. Over.

11:03.417 --> 11:06.542
You're trying to contact that

11:03.417 --> 11:06.542
ship you guys couldn't save.

11:06.583 --> 11:10.041
I have never forgiven myself

11:06.583 --> 11:10.041
for abandoning them in need.

11:10.083 --> 11:12.333
Chase, you had to.

11:12.375 --> 11:15.083
The Energon Vampire

11:12.375 --> 11:15.083
probably already got them,

11:15.125 --> 11:16.417
and it would've eaten you too.

11:16.458 --> 11:18.458
Perhaps you are right.

11:18.500 --> 11:23.208
It seems I must learn to live

11:18.500 --> 11:23.208
with my failure as a Rescue Bot.

11:23.250 --> 11:24.959
MAN ( on radio ):

11:23.250 --> 11:24.959
Damage...

11:25.000 --> 11:27.542
Can't... Need help...

11:27.583 --> 11:29.750
No way.

11:29.792 --> 11:32.542
That's the same message

11:29.792 --> 11:32.542
from your story.

11:32.583 --> 11:35.166
Those aboard the ship

11:32.583 --> 11:35.166
must still be alive

11:35.208 --> 11:38.917
and in need of rescue.

11:38.959 --> 11:41.667
CHASE:

11:38.959 --> 11:41.667
We must return to space

11:38.959 --> 11:41.667
immediately, Heatwave.

11:41.709 --> 11:44.041
Hold on.

11:41.709 --> 11:44.041
You expect me to believe

11:44.083 --> 11:46.542
that damaged ship's

11:44.083 --> 11:46.542
been in danger all this time?

11:46.583 --> 11:49.542
That's kind of

11:46.583 --> 11:49.542
a long emergency.

11:49.583 --> 11:52.500
Maybe the ship's crew

11:49.583 --> 11:52.500
went into stasis, like we did.

11:52.542 --> 11:54.375
Then Chase's message

11:52.542 --> 11:54.375
woke them up.

11:54.417 --> 11:57.875
Exactly. This is our chance to

11:54.417 --> 11:57.875
return and finish our mission.

11:57.917 --> 12:00.458
What about the mission

11:57.917 --> 12:00.458
Optimus gave us here?

12:00.500 --> 12:03.583
We may be the only ones to ever

12:00.500 --> 12:03.583
hear this message, Heatwave.

12:03.625 --> 12:06.583
My spark insists

12:03.625 --> 12:06.583
I must attempt to help.

12:06.625 --> 12:08.041
Whatever the consequence.

12:08.083 --> 12:10.542
No, Chase. And that's an order!

12:10.583 --> 12:13.041
Wait, Heatwave!

12:10.583 --> 12:13.041
I don't want him to go either.

12:13.083 --> 12:15.750
But we have to let Chase

12:13.083 --> 12:15.750
do what he believes in.

12:15.792 --> 12:18.041
It's part of why

12:15.792 --> 12:18.041
he's such a great Rescue Bot.

12:18.083 --> 12:20.208
( sighs )

12:20.250 --> 12:22.458
Fine.

12:20.250 --> 12:22.458
We'll cover for you here.

12:22.500 --> 12:25.458
But be careful.

12:25.500 --> 12:28.166
You'll need backup.

12:25.500 --> 12:28.166
I'm going too.

12:28.208 --> 12:29.959
Uh, if that's okay, Heatwave.

12:31.125 --> 12:33.125
What? Oh!

12:33.166 --> 12:35.333
No way. Not leaving.

12:35.375 --> 12:37.834
But definitely rooting for you.

12:37.875 --> 12:40.125
Graham and I need to make

12:37.875 --> 12:40.125
a few modifications to the ship

12:40.166 --> 12:41.417
before we go.

12:41.458 --> 12:43.792
This time,

12:41.458 --> 12:43.792
we'll be prepared.

12:45.417 --> 12:46.834
GRAHAM:

12:45.417 --> 12:46.834
Remember, Boulder,

12:46.875 --> 12:48.458
as soon as your ship's

12:46.875 --> 12:48.458
in deep space,

12:48.500 --> 12:50.625
turn on Doc's

12:48.500 --> 12:50.625
odor-blocking shield.

12:50.667 --> 12:53.083
Hey, can we get some of that

12:50.667 --> 12:53.083
technology for Kade's feet?

12:53.125 --> 12:55.000
My feet don't smell.

12:55.041 --> 12:56.291
Much.

12:56.333 --> 12:57.917
Thanks, Graham.

12:57.959 --> 13:00.166
If that Energon Vampire's

12:57.959 --> 13:00.166
still out there,

13:00.208 --> 13:03.000
at least it won't be able

13:00.208 --> 13:03.000
to catch our scent.

13:03.041 --> 13:04.709
Goodbye, everyone.

13:04.750 --> 13:07.583
Sir, it has been an honor

13:04.750 --> 13:07.583
serving with you.

13:07.625 --> 13:10.583
One I plan to continue.

13:10.625 --> 13:12.458
Be careful, and come back soon.

13:12.500 --> 13:14.417
That's an order, Chase.

13:14.458 --> 13:17.750
(  heroic theme playing  )

13:17.792 --> 13:19.667
CHIEF: Take care!

13:17.792 --> 13:19.667
CODY: Good luck, guys!

13:19.709 --> 13:21.166
Aw, we'll miss you!

13:19.709 --> 13:21.166
You guys got this!

13:21.208 --> 13:22.458
I'll visit Leafy for you!

13:22.500 --> 13:24.458
Bye Chase! Bye Boulder!

13:22.500 --> 13:24.458
Make us proud.

13:32.750 --> 13:34.542
(  playful theme playing  )

13:34.583 --> 13:36.208
BLADES:

13:34.583 --> 13:36.208
Oh, come on.

13:36.250 --> 13:38.208
You call that

13:36.250 --> 13:38.208
a tap-dancing cat?

13:38.250 --> 13:41.375
I've seen squirrels

13:38.250 --> 13:41.375
with better rhythm.

13:41.417 --> 13:42.375
( clears throat )

13:42.417 --> 13:44.250
Hey, Dad, what's up?

13:44.291 --> 13:46.667
It's time for me

13:44.291 --> 13:46.667
to go out on patrol.

13:46.709 --> 13:49.500
Blades, would you mind

13:46.709 --> 13:49.500
filling in as my police partner?

13:49.542 --> 13:52.375
You mean it?

13:49.542 --> 13:52.375
We'll get donuts together.

13:52.417 --> 13:54.709
Oh, and tell inside jokes

13:52.417 --> 13:54.709
and exchange stories

13:54.750 --> 13:56.709
about our toughest cases.

13:56.750 --> 13:59.417
We might even enforce the law.

14:02.166 --> 14:03.625
BLADES:

14:02.166 --> 14:03.625
Uh, wait, Chief?

14:03.667 --> 14:06.125
Am I the good cop

14:03.667 --> 14:06.125
or the bad cop?

14:06.166 --> 14:09.166
We're police, not cops.

14:09.208 --> 14:11.250
And we're both good.

14:14.709 --> 14:16.375
Follow that car!

14:16.417 --> 14:18.583
BLADES:

14:16.417 --> 14:18.583
I'm so excited!

14:18.625 --> 14:20.500
My first pursuit!

14:20.542 --> 14:22.875
(  imitating siren  )

14:22.917 --> 14:25.000
Uh, Blades?

14:22.917 --> 14:25.000
What are you doing?

14:25.041 --> 14:28.542
Oh, I don't have a siren,

14:25.041 --> 14:28.542
so I'm making one.

14:28.583 --> 14:30.750
(  imitating siren  )

14:30.792 --> 14:33.333
Why don't we try this

14:30.792 --> 14:33.333
in stealth mode?

14:33.375 --> 14:36.375
And I'm gonna need you

14:33.375 --> 14:36.375
to fly lower and faster.

14:36.417 --> 14:39.458
BLADES:

14:36.417 --> 14:39.458
Lower?

14:36.417 --> 14:39.458
But there are trees down there.

14:39.500 --> 14:41.208
Just weave

14:39.500 --> 14:41.208
your way through them.

14:41.250 --> 14:43.959
Now I know where Dani

14:41.250 --> 14:43.959
gets her stern voice from.

14:44.000 --> 14:47.208
I am definitely

14:44.000 --> 14:47.208
the good cop.

14:50.834 --> 14:53.875
Hey, Kade, can I borrow Heatwave

14:50.834 --> 14:53.875
for a ride to the airfield?

14:53.917 --> 14:56.667
N-O. He won't even

14:53.917 --> 14:56.667
drive me to Hayley's.

14:56.709 --> 14:59.333
It's Graham's turn with him.

15:00.583 --> 15:01.792
( metal creaking )

15:01.834 --> 15:03.417
Just hold her still, buddy.

15:03.458 --> 15:05.834
Uh, er, Heatwave.

15:09.208 --> 15:10.417
( grunts )

15:10.458 --> 15:11.417
Here, let me help you

15:10.458 --> 15:11.417
with that.

15:11.458 --> 15:13.041
( grunts )

15:15.041 --> 15:17.000
Oops.

15:15.041 --> 15:17.000
Uh...

15:17.041 --> 15:19.542
Maybe I should start on my

15:17.041 --> 15:19.542
Gremski Tech homework instead.

15:19.583 --> 15:21.208
( grunts )

15:21.250 --> 15:22.792
( loud smash )

15:22.834 --> 15:24.583
I can help with that too.

15:24.625 --> 15:26.750
Uh, that's okay, Heatwave.

15:26.792 --> 15:29.375
I'm filling in for Boulder.

15:26.792 --> 15:29.375
This is what he does, right?

15:29.417 --> 15:32.291
Well, yes, but...

15:32.333 --> 15:34.500
( sighs )

15:34.542 --> 15:36.792
You can read me the equations

15:34.542 --> 15:36.792
as I put them on the board.

15:36.834 --> 15:38.667
( groans )

15:38.709 --> 15:41.375
Um, squiggly sign, X,

15:41.417 --> 15:44.208
upside down two, triangle...

15:44.250 --> 15:45.875
This is supposed to make sense?

15:48.834 --> 15:50.750
( groans )

15:54.875 --> 15:56.542
CHIEF:

15:54.875 --> 15:56.542
Cody? It's time for dinner.

15:56.583 --> 15:58.709
I know they're too far to see.

15:58.750 --> 16:00.709
But I miss Chase and Boulder.

16:00.750 --> 16:05.291
Me too, son.

16:00.750 --> 16:05.291
Me too.

16:05.333 --> 16:07.583
(  dramatic theme playing  )

16:11.834 --> 16:13.750
We should be nearing the

16:11.834 --> 16:13.750
coordinates of the damaged ship.

16:13.792 --> 16:15.834
I will check the visual.

16:20.458 --> 16:22.166
More space wrecks?

16:22.208 --> 16:25.125
It seems our rescue services

16:22.208 --> 16:25.125
are desperately needed.

16:25.166 --> 16:26.917
Lowering odor-blocking shield

16:25.166 --> 16:26.917
for deployment.

16:32.667 --> 16:34.667
( creature wails )

16:36.792 --> 16:38.875
(  dramatic theme playing  )

16:40.583 --> 16:43.667
Hello? Anybody here?

16:45.792 --> 16:47.834
BOULDER:

16:45.792 --> 16:47.834
Hello?

16:47.875 --> 16:50.750
This is the Rescue Bots.

16:47.875 --> 16:50.750
We are here to assist.

16:50.792 --> 16:53.834
I am Chase. If you are

16:50.792 --> 16:53.834
in need of help, please respond.

16:53.875 --> 16:56.000
We are not selling anything.

16:56.041 --> 16:59.625
Chase. Look at this.

16:56.041 --> 16:59.625
It's the captain's log.

16:59.667 --> 17:02.083
"No one responded

16:59.667 --> 17:02.083
to our distress call.

17:02.125 --> 17:04.834
The ship

17:02.125 --> 17:04.834
has malfunctioned beyond repair.

17:04.875 --> 17:07.583
All my crew escaped

17:04.875 --> 17:07.583
in survival pods.

17:07.625 --> 17:10.333
I am taking what cargo I can

17:07.625 --> 17:10.333
and abandoning this vessel.

17:10.375 --> 17:11.959
End log."

17:12.000 --> 17:14.083
But the time stamp

17:12.000 --> 17:14.083
on this entry shows

17:14.125 --> 17:16.166
it was made before

17:14.125 --> 17:16.166
we received the ship's

17:16.208 --> 17:19.917
original emergency call.

17:16.208 --> 17:19.917
Long before.

17:19.959 --> 17:21.583
How could anybody

17:19.959 --> 17:21.583
have contacted us

17:21.625 --> 17:23.709
if no one is aboard?

17:23.750 --> 17:25.166
MAN ( on radio ):

17:23.750 --> 17:25.166
Damage...

17:25.208 --> 17:26.542
Can't...

17:26.583 --> 17:27.792
Need help...

17:27.834 --> 17:29.750
The message.

17:27.834 --> 17:29.750
Where is it coming from?

17:29.792 --> 17:31.583
I'm not sure.

17:31.625 --> 17:33.834
This computer

17:31.625 --> 17:33.834
shouldn't even have power.

17:36.250 --> 17:37.667
( energy crackling )

17:37.709 --> 17:40.333
Chase. Look.

17:40.375 --> 17:43.083
Cody's Energon Vampire.

17:43.125 --> 17:44.834
BOULDER:

17:43.125 --> 17:44.834
It's using the stored Energon

17:43.125 --> 17:44.834
in its tail

17:44.875 --> 17:46.875
to power up

17:44.875 --> 17:46.875
the ship's computer.

17:46.917 --> 17:49.709
The creature is the one

17:46.917 --> 17:49.709
sending those distress calls.

17:49.750 --> 17:52.250
And I flew us

17:49.750 --> 17:52.250
into its trap.

17:56.333 --> 17:58.583
( grunting )

17:58.625 --> 18:00.750
Guess we're not the only ones

17:58.625 --> 18:00.750
here to finish a job.

18:00.792 --> 18:02.917
I could almost respect

18:00.792 --> 18:02.917
the vampire for that.

18:02.959 --> 18:05.834
Were it not diabolical,

18:02.959 --> 18:05.834
lawless, and about to eat us.

18:05.875 --> 18:07.750
This time

18:05.875 --> 18:07.750
it won't get a chance.

18:07.792 --> 18:09.792
BOTH:

18:07.792 --> 18:09.792
Power up and energize!

18:09.834 --> 18:12.959
(  tense theme playing  )

18:15.500 --> 18:17.458
( roars )

18:17.500 --> 18:20.250
Eat our stardust.

18:20.291 --> 18:22.625
( both grunting )

18:23.834 --> 18:25.083
( roars )

18:31.875 --> 18:33.709
Powering up odor shield

18:33.750 --> 18:35.667
and setting a course

18:33.750 --> 18:35.667
for Griffin Rock.

18:35.709 --> 18:38.542
That's odd. The ship is not

18:35.709 --> 18:38.542
responding to my commands.

18:38.583 --> 18:41.792
The vampire sucked the Energon

18:38.583 --> 18:41.792
out of our power core.

18:41.834 --> 18:45.625
( electrical pulsing )

18:45.667 --> 18:48.750
There's no way to activate

18:45.667 --> 18:48.750
the ship's shields or go home.

18:48.792 --> 18:50.750
( both grunt )

18:50.792 --> 18:53.583
Perhaps one of the wrecks

18:50.792 --> 18:53.583
outside has Energon we can use.

18:53.625 --> 18:55.583
I don't think so.

18:55.625 --> 18:57.667
The vampire probably lured those

18:55.625 --> 18:57.667
ships here to feed on them.

18:57.709 --> 19:00.959
The only Energon around

18:57.709 --> 19:00.959
is inside that creature.

19:01.000 --> 19:03.583
Then that is what we'll use.

19:03.625 --> 19:06.458
We'd have to catch

19:03.625 --> 19:06.458
that thing first, and it's fast.

19:06.500 --> 19:09.417
Thanks to Chief, I am excellent

19:06.500 --> 19:09.417
at high-speed pursuits.

19:09.458 --> 19:11.250
Cover me.

19:13.834 --> 19:15.959
You are under arrest

19:13.834 --> 19:15.959
for Energon theft

19:16.000 --> 19:17.375
and general unpleasantness.

19:17.417 --> 19:18.709
( roars )

19:18.750 --> 19:21.000
(  heroic theme playing  )

19:34.709 --> 19:36.375
( grunting )

19:36.417 --> 19:38.709
It appears Cody was incorrect.

19:38.750 --> 19:42.166
Energon Vampires are much

19:38.750 --> 19:42.166
more persistent than mosquitoes.

19:43.875 --> 19:45.458
Chase! Transform!

19:47.709 --> 19:48.667
( engine revving )

19:48.709 --> 19:50.083
( roars )

19:56.500 --> 19:59.458
Hope this works. Otherwise,

19:56.500 --> 19:59.458
we're stuck here forever.

19:59.500 --> 20:00.875
I thought you enjoyed space.

20:00.917 --> 20:02.625
Not enough to change my address.

20:04.792 --> 20:06.417
( power crackling )

20:06.458 --> 20:08.000
( roars )

20:12.959 --> 20:14.667
BOULDER: Yes!

20:12.959 --> 20:14.667
CHASE: Outstanding!

20:14.709 --> 20:16.625
( powering up )

20:16.667 --> 20:19.041
Once our ship's powered up,

20:16.667 --> 20:19.041
I'll patch up the damage.

20:19.083 --> 20:21.125
We'll have just enough

20:19.083 --> 20:21.125
Energon to get home.

20:21.166 --> 20:25.375
The question that remains is,

20:21.166 --> 20:25.375
what do we do with Sparky?

20:25.417 --> 20:27.041
( roars )

20:27.083 --> 20:29.458
I think that's a question

20:27.083 --> 20:29.458
for Optimus Prime.

20:29.500 --> 20:33.166
Then I believe we can declare

20:29.500 --> 20:33.166
this mission accomplished.

20:36.333 --> 20:38.583
(  triumphant theme playing  )

20:41.667 --> 20:42.792
( ship door opens )

20:44.792 --> 20:46.083
Welcome home!

20:44.792 --> 20:46.083
Finally!

20:46.125 --> 20:48.000
Oh, we missed you!

20:46.125 --> 20:48.000
Good to see you, bud.

20:48.041 --> 20:50.667
What happened? Did you help

20:48.041 --> 20:50.667
the people who sent the message?

20:50.709 --> 20:52.750
Did you see

20:50.709 --> 20:52.750
another Energon Vampire?

20:52.792 --> 20:55.000
See it? We caught it.

20:55.041 --> 20:58.208
Pictures,

20:55.041 --> 20:58.208
or it didn't happen.

21:03.667 --> 21:05.500
Aah! It happened! It happened!

21:05.542 --> 21:07.542
But how?

21:07.583 --> 21:09.792
You visited Optimus?

21:09.834 --> 21:11.750
That is a tale

21:09.834 --> 21:11.750
for story night.

21:11.792 --> 21:13.083
In the meantime,

21:13.125 --> 21:15.125
it is good to be home.

21:15.166 --> 21:16.959
( chuckles ):

21:15.166 --> 21:16.959
And we're glad

21:15.166 --> 21:16.959
to have you back.

21:17.000 --> 21:18.458
Really glad.

21:17.000 --> 21:18.458
You have no idea.

21:18.500 --> 21:19.750
Could not do it

21:18.500 --> 21:19.750
without you, bud.

21:19.792 --> 21:21.750
I hate being a cop,

21:19.792 --> 21:21.750
good or bad.

21:21.792 --> 21:24.083
Does that homework stuff

21:21.792 --> 21:24.083
actually make sense to you?

21:24.125 --> 21:27.583
Guess this mission will

21:24.125 --> 21:27.583
keep you busy for a long time.

21:31.041 --> 21:32.917
(  dramatic theme playing  )
