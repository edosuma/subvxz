WEBVTT

00:48.458 --> 00:51.041
One, two, three, four.

01:07.833 --> 01:09.875
I need help!

01:10.458 --> 01:13.208
Paddles! First aid kit!
We have to stop the bleeding!

01:13.291 --> 01:14.458
He’s got no pulse.

01:14.541 --> 01:17.083
-Hurry! Come on!
-On your knees, bastards!

01:21.041 --> 01:22.250
Hang in there, please.

01:22.333 --> 01:24.333
-Hurry!
-Coming!

01:26.333 --> 01:27.583
Pass me the scissors.

01:28.250 --> 01:29.541
Come on.

01:32.541 --> 01:33.625
Jesus.

01:34.750 --> 01:36.458
-Jesus.
-Here.

01:37.500 --> 01:39.500
Grab the paddles. Come on, Arturo.

01:39.583 --> 01:40.708
Three, four.

01:42.083 --> 01:43.875
-Clear!
-Stand back!

01:45.250 --> 01:47.083
Stop, you’re searing a corpse.

01:47.166 --> 01:49.833
-Stockholm.
-Get the epinephrine. Now.

01:52.916 --> 01:53.750
I've got it.

02:05.166 --> 02:06.666
You killed him. Accept it.

02:10.375 --> 02:12.833
What are we doing?
The army's going to destroy us.

02:16.041 --> 02:17.083
Stand back!

02:20.416 --> 02:21.291
He has a pulse.

02:21.375 --> 02:22.500
Yes, he does.

02:23.083 --> 02:24.000
He has…

02:25.125 --> 02:26.000
a pulse.

02:26.083 --> 02:28.333
He's got a bullet in his heart.
He won't survive.

02:29.166 --> 02:32.666
We need to take him to the hospital.
We need to get him out now!

02:32.750 --> 02:34.083
He was dead a minute ago,

02:34.166 --> 02:37.583
and he’ll be dead again
when you stop blowing air into his lungs.

02:39.916 --> 02:42.375
If we get him out, we’ll become murderers.

02:42.458 --> 02:43.791
-No.
-Yes.

02:44.291 --> 02:48.791
They're going to storm in.
They’ll kill the hostages… and us.

02:48.875 --> 02:51.541
We can't let him die.

02:51.625 --> 02:55.291
Listen. That fucking crazy
son of a bitch was asking for it.

02:55.375 --> 02:58.375
You shot him twice.
You did well. Now you feel guilty.

02:58.458 --> 03:02.250
You want to get rid of your guilt
by tossing a bucket of shit on us all.

03:02.333 --> 03:06.000
You can have a clean conscience.
Mine is already dirty. I’ll kill him.

03:06.083 --> 03:07.791
-No!
-I'm going to shoot him!

03:07.875 --> 03:09.583
-No!
-For fuck's sake, stop!

03:10.583 --> 03:12.333
Relax!

03:13.000 --> 03:13.916
Listen.

03:14.416 --> 03:17.458
We’re taking him out,
and I’ll tell you why.

03:21.833 --> 03:23.833
We need a doctor!

03:25.166 --> 03:28.166
We need a doctor!

04:04.291 --> 04:07.916
As Stockholm watched Arturo
hang between life and death,

04:08.000 --> 04:09.708
she felt completely empty.

04:10.666 --> 04:15.000
She knew she had taken the last safety net
that could protect her son from the world.

04:16.250 --> 04:18.666
Arturo was her child's biological father.

04:19.750 --> 04:22.291
And Stockholm was beginning to realize

04:23.000 --> 04:27.041
that neither she nor Denver
would ever see Cincinnati again.

04:34.666 --> 04:36.416
She wasn't the only one thinking

04:36.500 --> 04:40.083
that parenthood is the largest source
of anxiety in the world.

04:40.166 --> 04:43.333
We were expecting the heist men
to make a move.

04:43.416 --> 04:45.458
You're watching live…

04:45.541 --> 04:48.250
Our lives depended on three guys 
whose hands were tied,

04:48.333 --> 04:50.000
and who had a gun in their faces.

04:50.500 --> 04:53.583
Under any other circumstances,
they'd have given up,

04:53.666 --> 04:56.416
but Benjamín had
a daughter inside the bank.

04:56.916 --> 04:59.500
And the Professor had ten.

06:11.125 --> 06:12.833
He's in a critical condition.

06:14.000 --> 06:15.916
I'll be there as soon as possible.

06:16.416 --> 06:20.250
Frisk these men in my office.
I need to start the interrogation.

06:20.333 --> 06:22.833
Run the electromagnetic detector
over them.

06:22.916 --> 06:24.916
They could have mics in their teeth.

06:31.333 --> 06:33.625
-No radio waves.
-Bring them some clothes.

06:34.416 --> 06:35.833
Colonel, they're clean.

06:37.416 --> 06:38.875
There are ten heist men.

06:39.375 --> 06:43.166
There's always one with the hostages,
here, in the library.

06:43.250 --> 06:45.041
What happened to Arturo Román?

06:46.875 --> 06:50.625
We tried to bring some hostages to safety…
but he lost it.

06:50.708 --> 06:54.708
He was obsessed with the weapons…
He attacked them with a flamethrower.

06:54.791 --> 06:56.916
Mounted a machine gun on a forklift.

06:57.000 --> 06:59.875
He put us in danger.
They had to take him down.

06:59.958 --> 07:03.083
He had no pulse for minutes,
but they revived him.

07:05.416 --> 07:09.541
They didn't revive anyone,
and they killed him in cold blood.

07:09.625 --> 07:12.791
It would be best if he died
in the next ten minutes.

07:12.875 --> 07:16.541
This is a gift, and I'll use it
to finish them off. No law, no rights!

07:16.625 --> 07:19.625
We'll shoot them in the back
even if they surrender!

07:19.708 --> 07:21.333
And that's why

07:21.416 --> 07:24.541
I need everyone
to think they're fucking murderers.

07:25.416 --> 07:26.250
Understood?

07:27.875 --> 07:29.125
Is anyone else injured?

07:29.208 --> 07:30.291
Two hostages.

07:32.000 --> 07:33.375
Román injured them.

07:33.458 --> 07:35.375
Absolutely not. It was them.

07:35.958 --> 07:39.041
I've been summoned
to the Ministry of the Interior.

07:39.125 --> 07:41.125
Do not intervene until I get back.

07:43.958 --> 07:46.000
Martínez, the documentation!

07:46.083 --> 07:47.083
Martínez!

07:57.041 --> 07:58.458
He would've killed you.

08:05.625 --> 08:06.791
What am I doing here?

08:08.666 --> 08:12.750
What am I doing here, throwing lead,
while my child's with some monks?

08:14.041 --> 08:15.291
When he grows up…

08:16.791 --> 08:19.666
and finds out about everything,
and asks about his mom…

08:20.458 --> 08:22.375
I don't want anyone to tell him who I was.

08:27.541 --> 08:29.541
I've ruined my son's life.

08:30.208 --> 08:32.875
My father also thinks he ruined my life,

08:32.958 --> 08:34.375
but I love him madly.

08:35.708 --> 08:39.333
A miner with a trans daughter in the '90s…

08:39.916 --> 08:41.833
He made a lot of mistakes.

08:42.541 --> 08:43.583
When I was five,

08:43.666 --> 08:47.750
I went straight to my dad,
and told him, "Daddy, I'm a girl."

08:47.833 --> 08:50.833
And he looked at me
with his serious miner face,

08:50.916 --> 08:55.166
and said, "Juan, you're a man.
Men are not girls."

08:57.416 --> 09:00.541
There was this makeup case that I loved…

09:00.625 --> 09:03.958
I don't know how many times
I asked him to buy it for me.

09:04.458 --> 09:08.000
And in the end,
I got a case, but it was full of tools.

09:09.416 --> 09:12.375
You end up understanding
that anything your dad deems girly

09:12.458 --> 09:14.208
is bad, so you hide it.

09:16.041 --> 09:19.125
But you couldn't tell anyone?

09:19.791 --> 09:22.166
There weren't any transgender people
in my town.

09:22.250 --> 09:25.250
There were a lot of pickpockets, burglars…

09:25.333 --> 09:29.041
there were tons of junkies,
but there weren't any trans people.

09:29.125 --> 09:32.750
In those days,
when a man dressed like a woman on TV,

09:32.833 --> 09:35.375
it was to fool around,
for people to laugh.

09:36.125 --> 09:38.250
My father was the first to crack up.

09:40.250 --> 09:43.583
But I forgave him,
because I didn't have any role models,

09:43.666 --> 09:45.000
but neither did he.

09:48.375 --> 09:52.083
I think confusion is
a parent's natural state.

09:54.500 --> 09:55.708
At the end of the day,

09:55.791 --> 09:59.791
your parents don't have to be perfect,
they just have to love you.

10:09.791 --> 10:11.250
Do you like your present?

10:15.291 --> 10:17.166
Are these gentlemen my present?

10:19.458 --> 10:21.166
They're the best teachers.

10:21.666 --> 10:24.166
Authentic graduate professors.

10:25.041 --> 10:27.625
A tip-top squadron for your first flight.

10:28.500 --> 10:31.208
And we've chosen, especially for you,

10:32.041 --> 10:34.083
a zero-risk robbery.

10:35.333 --> 10:37.041
Basically, it's just for fun.

10:37.541 --> 10:41.083
So tell me, Dad,
what's a zero-risk robbery?

10:41.166 --> 10:43.833
One that goes unnoticed when you rob them.

10:43.916 --> 10:46.416
But they'll find out at some point.

10:46.500 --> 10:47.541
Well, not now.

10:47.625 --> 10:50.708
Not in one, two, or three months…
Not even in ten.

10:51.416 --> 10:54.625
They'll find out in 15,
when the Viking gold museum opens.

10:55.625 --> 10:58.375
But by then, who will connect the dots?

10:59.541 --> 11:00.375
Viking gold?

11:16.250 --> 11:19.833
These are exact brass replicas
of all the pieces

11:19.916 --> 11:22.833
of the biggest Viking treasure
discovered to date.

11:23.333 --> 11:26.541
It was found at an archaeological site
eight months ago,

11:26.625 --> 11:29.916
and is now being held in
a Danish national heritage security room.

11:30.000 --> 11:34.833
The real treasure is in there, well kept,
in limbo, awaiting its destiny.

11:35.333 --> 11:37.708
Do you know where that security room is?

11:38.208 --> 11:40.375
At Frederiksborg Castle.

11:41.583 --> 11:45.750
Exactly the same venue
where I'm playing a concert in three days.

11:54.250 --> 11:55.958
It'll be the perfect soiree.

12:01.750 --> 12:04.958
Fancy cars, tuxedos, cocktails…

12:09.583 --> 12:10.750
classical music…

12:16.416 --> 12:17.875
and 12 kilos of gold.

12:25.375 --> 12:26.541
What are you laughing at?

12:27.125 --> 12:30.166
First, these are Viking grave goods,
not treasure.

12:30.250 --> 12:32.500
That's the term used by archaeologists.

12:33.333 --> 12:36.125
And second, I think you're a cynic.

12:36.208 --> 12:41.333
Dad, you pretend to be in love with art.
You restore monasteries.

12:41.416 --> 12:44.250
I'm sorry, but these items
should be in a museum.

12:44.333 --> 12:46.708
Wait a minute. Do you call this art?

12:46.791 --> 12:47.958
Of course I do.

12:48.041 --> 12:50.625
These objects
are more than 1,000 years old.

12:50.708 --> 12:53.333
They're hand carved,
and have Nordic symbols on them.

12:53.416 --> 12:56.166
-This is pure art!
-It's the work of a blacksmith.

12:56.250 --> 12:58.083
Of uncouth barbarians!

12:58.666 --> 13:01.333
These people pillaged iconic,

13:01.416 --> 13:04.250
extraordinary pieces,
Latin, Greek, Phoenician,

13:04.333 --> 13:08.000
and melted them down
to make wine goblets, plates, charms!

13:11.000 --> 13:13.458
We're giving the gold its dignity back.

13:13.541 --> 13:14.375
Oh, please.

13:16.958 --> 13:18.916
We're the ones who are going to make art.

13:20.291 --> 13:22.250
It'll be an unforgettable heist.

13:30.125 --> 13:32.916
Imminent press conference
at the Ministry of the Interior.

13:33.000 --> 13:37.208
Tamayo, the colonel in charge
of the operation, is going to speak soon.

13:37.291 --> 13:39.375
What's Arturo Román's condition?

13:39.458 --> 13:41.541
You almost kill
the only hostage people know.

13:41.625 --> 13:44.083
And you release the governor
of the Bank of Spain.

13:44.166 --> 13:46.666
Hello? Anyone running the show in there?

13:47.791 --> 13:50.750
This is the situation.
The army is going in.

13:50.833 --> 13:54.291
They're waiting for Tamayo to destroy you.
And he will, for two reasons.

13:54.375 --> 13:57.750
First, he's a coward and a bastard.

13:57.833 --> 14:00.500
Second, you've made it easy for him.

14:00.583 --> 14:03.125
Unanswered questions.
Are hostages being killed?

14:03.208 --> 14:06.083
Is the army preparing an intervention?

14:06.166 --> 14:09.708
You're shooting hostages.
Your fans are going to worship him.

14:10.291 --> 14:11.250
Your girlfriend,

14:12.000 --> 14:13.833
the trashy Power Ranger,

14:13.916 --> 14:17.250
the teddy bear from the Balkans,
the kid from the grave…

14:19.541 --> 14:21.791
The people you're willing to die for.

14:22.875 --> 14:23.791
Your people…

14:25.833 --> 14:27.083
are dead.

14:31.458 --> 14:32.791
Only I can prevent it.

14:33.750 --> 14:37.250
Give me the information.
I'll make a call, and nobody dies.

14:43.583 --> 14:47.333
Move over, please. Thank you.

14:50.791 --> 14:51.750
Good morning.

14:51.833 --> 14:54.666
We're holding
this additional press conference

14:54.750 --> 14:56.833
to inform you of the latest

14:56.916 --> 14:59.625
regarding the disappearance
of Alicia Sierra.

14:59.708 --> 15:01.875
Former Inspector Alicia Sierra

15:01.958 --> 15:04.583
has betrayed
the police force she represents,

15:04.666 --> 15:06.708
and is now working
for the Professor's gang.

15:06.791 --> 15:11.000
Since she escaped,
her whereabouts are unknown.

15:11.083 --> 15:13.666
We're using
all the means at our disposal

15:13.750 --> 15:15.500
to bring her to justice.

15:15.583 --> 15:17.666
This is her current appearance.

15:17.750 --> 15:21.875
This is a CCTV image
from a store close to her home.

15:21.958 --> 15:23.000
Son of a bitch.

15:23.083 --> 15:27.375
We lost the trail on her cell phone
two blocks from the National Court.

15:27.458 --> 15:29.791
We've located a safe house in the area

15:29.875 --> 15:32.958
where she may have coordinated
Murillo's extraction.

15:33.041 --> 15:35.000
All of this is under investigation.

15:35.083 --> 15:38.708
The forensic analysis
on the equipment found at her house

15:38.791 --> 15:43.333
suggests that she leaked the emails
about the torture procedures in Algeria.

15:43.916 --> 15:48.875
She falsified testimonies,
and broadcast Anibal Cortés' fake burial.

15:48.958 --> 15:54.083
We've found traces of encrypted
communication with opaque servers.

15:54.166 --> 15:59.583
Alicia Sierra used them to leak
sensitive information to the Professor.

16:00.250 --> 16:05.041
In the last few hours, we have learned
that she received eight million euros

16:05.125 --> 16:07.041
in companies in her name

16:07.125 --> 16:08.958
in Panama, Belize, and Delaware.

16:10.375 --> 16:13.916
What did you expect?
You've got no way out.

16:14.000 --> 16:15.833
There's always a way out.

16:15.916 --> 16:18.000
Now, if you have any questions…

16:18.083 --> 16:19.875
-Colonel, please!
-You.

16:19.958 --> 16:22.250
What's Arturo Román's condition?

16:22.333 --> 16:24.416
He's in a critical condition, very severe.

16:24.500 --> 16:25.625
It's too late now.

16:26.916 --> 16:33.375
The police, the CNI, the government…
They've all fabricated the evidence.

16:33.458 --> 16:37.083
If you turn us in, they'll say that,
after betraying them, you betrayed us.

16:37.166 --> 16:38.500
Shut up.

16:38.583 --> 16:41.625
Do you really think they'll admit
to fabricating evidence?

16:41.708 --> 16:45.291
The CNI never backs down or apologizes.
You know that.

16:45.375 --> 16:46.583
Shut up.

16:46.666 --> 16:48.375
-Colonel.
-I have a question.

16:48.458 --> 16:52.125
-Are you planning an intervention?
-Things have changed drastically.

16:52.208 --> 16:56.291
What was once a heist with hostages
is now a kidnapping with executions.

16:56.375 --> 17:00.458
-The protocols are completely different.
-Is that why the army has been mobilized?

17:00.541 --> 17:04.083
As the operation is ongoing,
I cannot provide further details.

17:04.166 --> 17:05.666
-Please!
-Colonel! Here!

17:05.750 --> 17:07.583
That's the green light.

17:09.791 --> 17:13.041
It's going to be a massacre.
They're going to go in.

17:13.125 --> 17:15.333
They kicked me out of the game.

17:15.416 --> 17:17.833
I don't even know
how they're getting the gold out.

17:17.916 --> 17:18.916
The gold.

17:19.000 --> 17:21.375
-It doesn't matter anymore.
-Of course it does.

17:21.458 --> 17:24.333
You don't get it.
The gold doesn't matter anymore.

17:24.416 --> 17:26.250
-Shut up.
-You've been condemned.

17:26.333 --> 17:29.458
You've been charged
with the same crimes as us, or even worse.

17:29.541 --> 17:31.208
-Quiet.
-Yours include disobedience.

17:31.291 --> 17:33.125
-Shut up.
-You're a traitor now.

17:33.208 --> 17:36.416
-Shut up.
-For the police, government, colleagues…

17:36.500 --> 17:38.791
-Shut up.
-No one will bail you out of jail.

17:38.875 --> 17:40.541
Shut up! I need to think!

17:43.458 --> 17:45.958
No.

17:47.750 --> 17:48.708
Her water broke.

17:50.875 --> 17:51.750
Not now.

17:55.791 --> 17:58.791
Not now.

17:58.875 --> 18:02.166
Be reasonable.
You can't raise a child in prison.

18:03.041 --> 18:07.750
Kids can be raised just fine in prison.
It's called a "prison nursery."

18:09.625 --> 18:10.791
Godfather…

18:11.958 --> 18:13.916
Thanks for including me in this.

18:14.666 --> 18:15.666
I needed it.

18:18.083 --> 18:20.833
If you needed money,
all you had to do was call.

18:21.541 --> 18:23.625
I needed someone to believe in me.

18:23.708 --> 18:25.833
She's talking about her father, Dad.

18:26.333 --> 18:28.333
I know she's talking about her father.

18:28.416 --> 18:32.208
He thinks I can't do heists anymore,
but I can do them even better than before.

18:32.291 --> 18:35.791
But you have to study for this one.
We're going to print 2.4 billion euros.

18:35.875 --> 18:37.666
Like this: chug, chug, chug.

18:37.750 --> 18:41.250
You told your father you're here, right?

18:41.958 --> 18:43.666
He doesn't know, nor will he.

18:44.958 --> 18:45.875
Okay.

18:46.375 --> 18:48.041
Well, we're going to bed.

18:48.125 --> 18:51.875
Tomorrow we have shooting practice
and… whatnot. Let's go.

18:52.458 --> 18:54.458
-Good night.
-Good night.

19:15.375 --> 19:16.208
Dani.

19:18.875 --> 19:19.791
Son!

19:24.208 --> 19:27.166
-Wake up!
-Dude! What's wrong?

19:27.250 --> 19:29.291
I think we misunderstood something.

19:29.375 --> 19:31.208
What did we misunderstand, Dad?

19:33.375 --> 19:36.958
It's five in the morning, Dad!
What did we misunderstand?

19:37.041 --> 19:39.583
Maybe we didn't understand
how Benjamín wanted us

19:39.666 --> 19:43.166
to look after Julia,
and we're screwing it up.

19:43.250 --> 19:46.125
We're not screwing anything up.
Julia wants to be here.

19:46.208 --> 19:50.583
Julia's a grown, adult woman.
She's got her own life, she's independent.

19:50.666 --> 19:54.291
I don't care what she wants.
I need to tell Benjamín

19:54.375 --> 19:56.791
that I might have messed
the "right track" thing up.

19:56.875 --> 20:00.166
And maybe my idea of the right track

20:00.250 --> 20:04.875
isn't the same right or wrong track
Benjamín has in mind.

20:04.958 --> 20:08.875
We need to clean this mess up
before the bullets start flying.

20:08.958 --> 20:11.875
Dad, Benjamín is in prison,

20:11.958 --> 20:14.791
and there's nothing we can do
because we don't have a phone.

20:14.875 --> 20:17.250
We have to soldier on. So good night.

20:22.333 --> 20:24.791
Come on, get up! I have to call him.

20:24.875 --> 20:27.125
You want to call him in prison right now?

20:27.208 --> 20:28.708
What do you mean by "right now"?

20:28.791 --> 20:32.125
We have to walk for three or four hours
until we find a phone.

20:32.208 --> 20:35.500
-I'm not going anywhere.
-You're not what?

20:35.583 --> 20:36.541
-God.
-Come on.

20:36.625 --> 20:39.000
-I can't go back to sleep now.
-Get up.

20:40.416 --> 20:43.666
The C4 goes behind steel sheets.
We don't want a sympathetic detonation.

20:43.750 --> 20:47.291
Our defense began
by moving the weapons to a safe place.

20:48.041 --> 20:49.333
Grab seven more.

20:49.416 --> 20:51.041
Rio, grenades?

20:51.125 --> 20:53.375
-Six.
-Take as many as you can.

20:53.458 --> 20:58.041
We felt like we were building
our own grave, not a bunker.

20:58.125 --> 20:59.125
We got this.

20:59.208 --> 21:01.708
Without the Professor outside,
we felt like orphans.

21:01.791 --> 21:04.166
This is the last fight. Stay strong!

21:04.250 --> 21:07.875
No father, no plan, and no hope.

21:07.958 --> 21:10.833
Forgive me for the soccer reference,
but it's all I've got.

21:12.125 --> 21:16.208
Sometimes, during the World Cup finals,
you can tell who will lose.

21:16.291 --> 21:18.916
You can smell a team's fear
as they sing their anthem.

21:19.000 --> 21:21.875
And I can smell the fear here today.

21:24.375 --> 21:26.083
But we're going to change that.

21:27.041 --> 21:28.708
A game is 11 against 11.

21:29.375 --> 21:32.041
We're playing ten against 10,000,
and have no coach.

21:33.041 --> 21:36.041
Calling the heist team
at the Bank of Spain.

21:36.125 --> 21:39.125
Breaking news from the stormwater tank.

21:39.208 --> 21:41.541
Sierra's not wearing
her police armband anymore.

21:44.583 --> 21:46.916
Tamayo ousted her. He let her go.

21:47.541 --> 21:50.208
Sierra's flying solo.
Do you know what that means?

21:50.958 --> 21:51.875
Can you guess?

21:54.375 --> 21:56.166
Tokyo? Rio, do you know?

21:58.666 --> 22:03.166
The Professor is not finished.
He's playing his own game, and he can win.

22:03.750 --> 22:05.208
He's playing against a nutcase.

22:05.291 --> 22:07.750
No. She's much more than that.

22:09.541 --> 22:13.083
She's a raging nutcase
who's been betrayed by her own people,

22:14.208 --> 22:15.833
They threw her to the wolves.

22:16.500 --> 22:20.000
She probably already knows the Professor
isn't her biggest enemy anymore.

22:27.541 --> 22:29.791
-Breathe with your diaphragm.
-What?

22:29.875 --> 22:33.291
Breathe with your diaphragm
to control the contractions.

22:33.375 --> 22:35.708
Are you a midwife now?

22:37.500 --> 22:39.083
We can't win this war.

22:41.458 --> 22:43.583
The Balkan bear got the strategy wrong.

22:43.666 --> 22:46.791
We don't need to win this war.
We're going to lose it…

22:48.125 --> 22:49.583
but very slowly.

22:52.916 --> 22:54.083
And you…

22:55.666 --> 22:57.208
my boys and girls in red…

22:58.958 --> 23:02.333
We, who have been cast off by society,

23:03.750 --> 23:06.541
a team made up
of the biggest losers in history,

23:06.625 --> 23:10.375
trans, criminals, scum, gays…

23:11.750 --> 23:13.208
Balkans, Latinos…

23:13.291 --> 23:15.458
What can they teach us about losing?

23:17.250 --> 23:19.958
We know how much it hurts
to lose this slowly.

23:20.041 --> 23:21.166
We know.

23:22.291 --> 23:23.958
And we can lose one more day.

23:24.458 --> 23:26.708
Why would we want to lose another day?

23:30.083 --> 23:33.041
To melt the gold,
and get it all out of the vault.

23:34.958 --> 23:36.166
We're back.

23:38.583 --> 23:40.458
It sounds fucking good to me.

23:40.541 --> 23:43.500
But you've got a plan to lose,
and you're not filling us in.

23:43.583 --> 23:44.916
Of course I do.

23:45.000 --> 23:46.875
I may be an engineer,

23:46.958 --> 23:49.375
but being an infantry general
is my true calling.

23:50.875 --> 23:51.750
I need to dilate.

23:51.833 --> 23:54.916
Oxytocin… would work really well.

23:56.500 --> 23:58.125
Unfortunately, we don't have any.

23:58.208 --> 24:01.666
-I need something for the pain.
-No, that would put the baby at risk.

24:01.750 --> 24:04.291
Are you fucking kidding me?

24:05.458 --> 24:07.458
In an open field,
we wouldn't stand a chance.

24:07.541 --> 24:10.583
But with rooms, their advantage wanes.

24:11.083 --> 24:14.958
We'll crawl through every corner,
every fucking heap of rubble.

24:15.041 --> 24:18.333
We'll throw a grenade, then another,
followed by machine gun fire.

24:18.416 --> 24:20.208
This isn't a fucking Vietnam War movie.

24:20.291 --> 24:23.791
Exactly. It's worse.
This is the defense of Stalingrad.

24:23.875 --> 24:26.458
This strategy was devised
by General Chuikov.

24:26.541 --> 24:30.666
We'll blast music so loudly
they won't hear the grenades, the gunfire,

24:30.750 --> 24:32.000
and even better…

24:33.291 --> 24:35.375
they won't even hear their own radio.

24:36.833 --> 24:37.833
Alicia, listen.

24:38.458 --> 24:40.875
You can't go to a hospital.

24:41.458 --> 24:43.291
And you can't do it on your own.

24:44.083 --> 24:46.125
Release us. You need help.

24:46.208 --> 24:48.541
-Let us help.
-I'm going to give birth…

24:49.666 --> 24:50.500
on my own.

24:51.083 --> 24:52.625
Like my grandmother did,

24:52.708 --> 24:56.083
and like hundreds
of women throughout history have done.

24:57.083 --> 24:58.166
Like this!

25:02.208 --> 25:07.166
Welcome to the spectacle of life.

25:07.250 --> 25:10.375
I need three volunteers.
This mission won't be easy.

25:10.875 --> 25:13.583
These three will have to take the rear.

25:13.666 --> 25:16.958
Our only chance
is to attack them on both fronts.

25:17.458 --> 25:21.708
We'll need to move fast
through the elevator shaft, the air ducts,

25:21.791 --> 25:23.833
or wherever we can, but fast.

25:27.916 --> 25:29.208
Logroño.

25:29.708 --> 25:32.875
You seem to know more than him.
How dilated am I?

25:33.458 --> 25:34.916
I couldn't tell you…

25:35.000 --> 25:36.583
Dilation is measured by touch.

25:39.333 --> 25:40.583
Let's see.

25:42.208 --> 25:44.000
What part of the plan is this?

25:44.083 --> 25:46.833
The birth plan!

25:46.916 --> 25:49.333
I need three volunteers and, listen up…

25:50.625 --> 25:52.500
these three will be the most exposed.

26:02.166 --> 26:03.708
Good. Let's do it.

26:03.791 --> 26:05.500
Come on!

26:07.500 --> 26:08.500
Denver,

26:09.833 --> 26:10.958
say goodbye to her.

26:11.625 --> 26:15.291
We've a long night ahead. This might
be the last time you see each other.

26:24.291 --> 26:26.125
Are we seriously going to walk?

26:26.625 --> 26:29.166
How else can we get there at 5:00 a.m.?

26:29.250 --> 26:31.041
Shit, we could steal a car.

26:31.125 --> 26:35.291
There you go again. Is stealing always
the first thing you think of?

26:35.375 --> 26:37.708
As soon as something gets tough,
boom, a theft.

26:37.791 --> 26:40.541
Says the one who brought me here
to rob the Royal Mint.

26:40.625 --> 26:43.500
So you can learn to do it intelligently,
like the Professor.

26:43.583 --> 26:45.041
He steals as one should,

26:45.125 --> 26:48.541
in one big go, not small amounts,
and screwing other people over.

26:48.625 --> 26:52.041
It's 5:00 a.m. If we leave now,
we won't be back until 11:00.

26:52.125 --> 26:54.333
If the Professor sees us,
what will you tell him?

26:54.416 --> 26:58.125
See? You're thinking with your head,
and being sensible.

26:58.708 --> 27:00.000
We'll steal a car,

27:00.083 --> 27:03.083
but from someone
who won't report it stolen.

27:14.125 --> 27:15.958
-Coming.
-Come on.

27:27.750 --> 27:31.125
What can I say, Benjamín,
that you don't already know?

27:33.333 --> 27:35.166
There's a risk.

27:37.500 --> 27:39.583
The job is huge,

27:39.666 --> 27:42.208
but every detail
has been thought out, I swear.

27:42.291 --> 27:45.750
If something goes wrong,
Julia will be taken to a men's prison.

27:46.250 --> 27:47.875
I can't even imagine that.

27:47.958 --> 27:51.916
Yeah, but if she asked
to be transferred to a women's prison,

27:52.000 --> 27:53.125
they'd probably do it.

27:53.208 --> 27:56.416
It's taken Julia a long time
to get where she is now.

27:57.708 --> 27:58.750
She's…

27:59.500 --> 28:01.250
just starting to live her life.

28:01.791 --> 28:05.583
She's happy.
I'd never seen my daughter happy…

28:06.625 --> 28:08.000
in 30 years.

28:10.375 --> 28:12.625
Her body was a prison.
Don't make her go back.

28:17.291 --> 28:20.166
If the job is as big as you say,
won't you look after her?

28:22.208 --> 28:24.375
Of course. As if she were my own daughter.

28:24.458 --> 28:26.250
Benjamín, listen,

28:26.333 --> 28:30.166
I've stood by Julia my whole life,
and I'll stand by her until the day I die.

28:35.708 --> 28:37.125
Thanks, Dani.

28:37.208 --> 28:38.625
Don't… mention it.

28:39.166 --> 28:40.500
I have to go.

28:40.583 --> 28:41.958
Bye.

28:43.875 --> 28:45.416
You overdid it a bit.

28:45.500 --> 28:46.500
I did? How?

28:47.000 --> 28:48.291
Let's get out of here.

28:50.500 --> 28:52.166
-Bye.
-See you.

28:58.291 --> 28:59.291
Coming.

29:06.708 --> 29:11.041
That phone call is irreversible.
Think about it for a second, please.

29:11.125 --> 29:13.625
That call will condemn you and your child.

29:16.791 --> 29:20.916
You can hate me as much as you want.
You can wish me dead, or whatever,

29:21.000 --> 29:22.416
but, sadly, right now,

29:22.500 --> 29:25.041
to save your and your kid's life,
you need to save mine.

29:25.125 --> 29:28.083
Right now,
we're in the same place, we're equals.

29:28.166 --> 29:30.666
You and I aren't equals,
you piece of shit.

29:31.250 --> 29:34.166
Your job is to break the law.
I work to stop that.

29:37.833 --> 29:38.875
God.

29:40.416 --> 29:42.458
And that's what I'm doing.

29:45.875 --> 29:47.666
You're condemning your own child.

29:48.416 --> 29:52.000
They'll destroy you
because they don't owe you anything.

29:52.083 --> 29:53.250
My life.

29:54.625 --> 29:56.000
They owe me my life.

29:58.375 --> 30:03.500
I became the queen bitch for them.

30:06.458 --> 30:09.541
And they can't let bitches like me down.

30:10.208 --> 30:11.583
I won't let you down.

30:11.666 --> 30:12.500
Shut up.

30:14.208 --> 30:15.541
I won't let you down.

30:15.625 --> 30:17.875
Don't talk to me
as if I were one of your people.

30:18.958 --> 30:21.375
I won't spend the rest of my life
on the run.

30:22.958 --> 30:24.041
I don't run away.

30:25.000 --> 30:26.041
I don't hide.

30:26.125 --> 30:29.500
I don't go to the Philippines.

30:31.375 --> 30:33.875
I liked my life.

30:34.875 --> 30:37.625
I like Madrid. And lamb tripe.

30:38.333 --> 30:41.208
And the Puerta del Sol. And corruption.

30:41.291 --> 30:44.000
I'm not losing my country because of you!

30:44.958 --> 30:46.708
Tamayo betrayed you, not me.

30:48.583 --> 30:49.541
I hate you.

30:50.916 --> 30:53.833
Fine. But we're running out of time,

30:53.916 --> 30:58.416
and your hate for me doesn't entitle you
to put your baby's life at risk.

31:01.458 --> 31:02.541
This kid…

31:03.500 --> 31:05.916
adores risk, you son of a bitch!

31:13.000 --> 31:14.958
Fuck!

31:36.583 --> 31:37.666
Follow me.

31:40.500 --> 31:43.375
Tamayo's here,
and soldiers are going in with him.

31:49.750 --> 31:51.291
Did the Professor call?

31:52.375 --> 31:54.541
If he had, I'd have informed you.

31:54.625 --> 31:55.833
Everyone out!

31:55.916 --> 31:58.458
We're going to plan
a military intervention here!

31:58.541 --> 31:59.833
Move it!

32:08.916 --> 32:12.375
Police officers are leaving the tent.
They're organizing something.

32:12.458 --> 32:14.791
Copy. We've got a few minutes.

32:22.416 --> 32:25.000
When you shoot someone,
you feel like shit.

32:27.083 --> 32:28.416
You hate yourself.

32:31.375 --> 32:32.750
I shot you.

32:34.583 --> 32:36.750
Something bad could've happened to you.

32:39.041 --> 32:40.958
I could've been a murderer…

32:42.458 --> 32:44.916
You think the only option
is prison or be killed.

32:46.666 --> 32:47.583
But no.

32:48.666 --> 32:49.833
It's not how it works.

32:51.083 --> 32:52.333
I treated your wounds.

32:53.708 --> 32:54.791
I danced for you.

32:57.083 --> 33:00.791
And ever since then
we've been fucking happy, Mónica.

33:04.208 --> 33:07.125
Just because things worked out once
doesn't mean they will twice.

33:09.541 --> 33:10.625
In fact…

33:11.416 --> 33:13.500
we may be pushing our luck too far.

33:19.791 --> 33:21.458
I'd like to talk when you get back.

33:25.833 --> 33:27.041
What if I don't come back?

33:31.125 --> 33:32.708
Then I'd like to kiss you.

33:34.583 --> 33:35.541
A first kiss.

33:38.916 --> 33:40.916
A first kiss is only the first time.

33:42.083 --> 33:44.208
That's why it's called a first kiss.

33:46.833 --> 33:51.000
But I don't want to give you a last kiss…
I want to give you a second first kiss.

33:52.458 --> 33:55.083
Like a kiss couples give each other
when they make up.

33:56.875 --> 33:57.916
That's the one I want.

34:37.250 --> 34:42.000
The building is blast resistant.
That leaves us few options to break in.

34:42.833 --> 34:44.333
The main entrance,

34:44.416 --> 34:47.416
the loading docks… or the windows.

34:47.500 --> 34:51.791
But they'll be expecting us
to come in through precisely those places,

34:51.875 --> 34:54.125
so none of them is an option.

34:54.208 --> 34:56.041
But there's another option.

34:56.125 --> 34:58.750
You know Captain Gandía.
He was a green beret.

34:58.833 --> 35:02.083
I'm honored to have served by his side,
and some of you have too.

35:02.166 --> 35:04.125
He's proposing an alternative plan.

35:04.625 --> 35:07.708
The rooftop is marked
as "blast resistant" in the plans,

35:07.791 --> 35:10.708
but part of it isn't
due to a load-bearing issue.

35:11.208 --> 35:13.833
It's confidential information.
They ignore it.

35:13.916 --> 35:17.208
There's a hole
in the Bank of Spain's blast protection?

35:17.291 --> 35:19.125
No. It's fully protected.

35:20.041 --> 35:21.333
But it starts at the museum,

35:21.416 --> 35:24.125
and ends with steel doors
like the ones on the ground floor.

35:24.208 --> 35:26.250
So we'll climb up there,

35:26.333 --> 35:29.916
blow the roof off,
and go straight into the dining hall.

35:30.000 --> 35:34.125
That coffered ceiling goes back
to the 18th century… During the Civil War,

35:34.208 --> 35:37.875
it was brought here from a palace in Jaén
to protect it from the bombings.

35:38.375 --> 35:40.541
Do you think someone in Bosnia said,

35:40.625 --> 35:43.416
"Don't blow up the Mostar Bridge,
it's old"?

35:43.500 --> 35:45.583
No, and there it is, rebuilt.

35:45.666 --> 35:47.375
Or the Sarajevo Library.

35:47.458 --> 35:49.541
During the World War, Berlin burned,

35:49.625 --> 35:52.666
and nobody said, "Don't bomb
this neighborhood, it's pretty."

35:53.416 --> 35:56.333
There are Goya paintings
and Quimbaya gold in there…

35:56.416 --> 36:00.541
We have Amnesty International on our ass.
Are we going to confront UNESCO as well?

36:00.625 --> 36:03.125
You couldn't care less
about Quimbaya gold.

36:03.208 --> 36:07.125
You're looking at me as if I'm a dog.
Tell me what the fuck you're thinking!

36:07.208 --> 36:11.250
You condemned an innocent person.
You slandered her. She'll go to prison.

36:11.333 --> 36:15.125
Angelito, a country's security
is above any individual's honor,

36:15.208 --> 36:16.416
it's above all else!

36:16.500 --> 36:19.166
The National Reserve
is a country's backbone.

36:19.250 --> 36:24.041
Is Sierra's dignity more important
than the safety of 47 million people?

36:24.125 --> 36:25.666
For fuck's sake, Tamayo!

36:25.750 --> 36:30.416
You condemned her to save yourself,
not to save 47 million people.

36:40.500 --> 36:43.458
We'll get in by blowing up
that coffered ceiling!

36:55.625 --> 36:59.208
Come on, baby!
A little bit more, and you'll be out!

36:59.791 --> 37:02.000
Fuck!

37:02.083 --> 37:04.541
It won't come out!

37:05.291 --> 37:07.208
Why won't it come out?

37:08.208 --> 37:09.500
Because that's not the head.

37:10.166 --> 37:11.666
What?

37:11.750 --> 37:13.000
It's breech.

37:13.583 --> 37:14.458
What?

37:15.833 --> 37:16.666
What do I do?

37:16.750 --> 37:19.083
You need to insert your hand,

37:19.166 --> 37:23.125
place the baby on your arm,
as if it were horseback riding,

37:23.208 --> 37:27.208
hold its mouth with your index and thumb,
bring its head close to the breastbone…

37:27.708 --> 37:29.375
and pull it out.

37:34.208 --> 37:37.458
There's no other way,
and you need to do it now.

37:38.500 --> 37:39.875
You have to release me.

37:50.208 --> 37:51.833
A convoy is leaving the tent.

37:54.416 --> 37:56.416
Copy. Everyone in position.

37:56.500 --> 37:57.333
Lisbon?

37:59.875 --> 38:00.875
We're ready.

38:13.625 --> 38:15.375
-Tokyo?
-I'm in.

38:21.250 --> 38:22.791
Matías, code red.

38:23.291 --> 38:24.916
Okay, no one moves!

38:25.000 --> 38:28.791
Put your head between your legs,
and brace yourself. Like in an airplane!

38:30.625 --> 38:31.958
It's going to be bumpy.

38:55.166 --> 38:56.250
Change of plans!

38:56.333 --> 38:57.750
Whatever happens up there,

38:57.833 --> 39:02.166
no matter what you hear,
no matter what shakes, don't stop melting!

39:02.250 --> 39:07.083
Don't stop even if Jesus appears,
and dances reggaeton in front of you.

39:07.166 --> 39:08.833
-Bogotá?
-I'm heading up.

39:11.125 --> 39:13.500
If anyone's thinking
of taking a bit of gold

39:13.583 --> 39:15.708
to make earrings for their grandma…

39:16.916 --> 39:17.958
don't.

39:18.958 --> 39:23.125
Ask Daddy for the gold when we're outside,
understood, children?

39:23.875 --> 39:25.000
Get to work!

39:25.083 --> 39:26.250
Come on! Let's go!

39:26.333 --> 39:28.166
-Let's do it!
-Start melting!

39:40.541 --> 39:42.000
They're heading southwest.

39:45.041 --> 39:45.875
God.

40:05.625 --> 40:07.375
No!

40:15.083 --> 40:16.791
Marseille, grab sheets.

40:17.375 --> 40:18.875
Benjamín, clean water.

40:24.875 --> 40:26.958
Move! Everyone out!

40:27.041 --> 40:28.000
Quickly!

40:28.708 --> 40:29.625
Everyone out!

40:30.208 --> 40:31.916
Come on! Out!

40:32.500 --> 40:34.625
They're in a blind spot.

40:35.208 --> 40:38.875
If they're in a blind spot,
it's because they're climbing.

40:38.958 --> 40:40.625
They're going to blow the roof!

40:41.208 --> 40:43.916
Tokyo, Denver, Manila, go to the stairs!

40:54.375 --> 40:55.458
Ready!

40:57.250 --> 40:58.291
Now!

42:14.083 --> 42:15.416
God.

42:16.250 --> 42:17.666
Listen to me.

42:17.750 --> 42:20.208
Start taking deep breaths.

42:20.791 --> 42:21.916
That's it.

42:22.000 --> 42:24.791
You can't push now. That's very important.

42:24.875 --> 42:27.083
I'm going to put my hand in.

42:27.166 --> 42:28.416
-Okay?
-Okay.

42:32.166 --> 42:33.250
It'll be okay.

42:34.083 --> 42:35.500
It'll be okay.

42:35.583 --> 42:36.583
Let's do it.

42:52.583 --> 42:54.666
-Location, Tokyo.
-We're on the second floor.

42:55.708 --> 42:56.916
Third floor.

42:57.416 --> 43:00.083
Go to the roof,
and catch them from behind. Helsinki?

43:00.166 --> 43:01.708
I'm building a trench!

43:01.791 --> 43:03.583
Retreat to the museum. Wait for me.

43:16.708 --> 43:18.750
-I can't.
-No, for God's sake.

43:19.333 --> 43:21.791
Please!

43:43.458 --> 43:44.416
Come on.

43:46.041 --> 43:47.208
A little bit more.

43:53.000 --> 43:55.250
The breastbone. I've got it.

44:02.833 --> 44:03.833
Please…

44:03.916 --> 44:04.875
Almost there.

44:07.125 --> 44:08.458
I'm pulling it out.

44:08.541 --> 44:10.041
A little more.

44:16.875 --> 44:19.250
Helsinki, get out.
Take shelter in the museum.

44:19.833 --> 44:21.000
Negative!

44:39.208 --> 44:40.208
Let's do this.

44:42.541 --> 44:43.375
Let's do it.

44:46.000 --> 44:46.833
Take cover.

45:12.583 --> 45:14.458
…a terrible explosion…

45:36.125 --> 45:38.791
LIVE
EXPLOSION AT THE BANK OF SPAIN

47:10.625 --> 47:13.208
