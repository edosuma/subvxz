WEBVTT

01:07.693 --> 01:09.904
It's a neglected sense, hearing.

01:09.987 --> 01:11.322
And it shouldn't be.

01:11.405 --> 01:14.450
Because all too often,
our first warning of danger is sound.

01:14.825 --> 01:16.369
{933931

01:16.994 --> 01:18.663
Shreeve, what are you
trying to...

01:21.666 --> 01:22.667
{933931

01:24.835 --> 01:26.379
Shreeve!

01:30.466 --> 01:32.385
See, Mr. Powers?

01:33.302 --> 01:35.221
Just an illusion.

01:37.390 --> 01:39.684
- I knew that.
- Of course.

01:39.767 --> 01:41.687
But after all the research money
you've given me,

01:42.061 --> 01:43.813
I thought you deserved a demonstration.

01:45.189 --> 01:47.233
Frankly, I was hoping for more.

01:47.566 --> 01:48.776
More, you say?

01:51.654 --> 01:54.282
Look at this sound suit.
I just finished it.

01:54.365 --> 01:56.325
It's got four built-in
sound generators...

01:56.409 --> 01:58.703
How's it any better
then an old boom box?

01:58.786 --> 02:00.162
Different kind of boom.

02:00.413 --> 02:01.580
Watch.

02:03.374 --> 02:05.668
It generates ultra
low-frequency vibrations

02:05.751 --> 02:07.920
which I can aim in any direction.

02:12.800 --> 02:15.094
Imagine the time and effort
this suit would save

02:15.177 --> 02:17.430
construction workers, road builders.

02:17.513 --> 02:19.765
- Dynamite's cheaper.
- But...

02:19.849 --> 02:22.101
Shreeve, you're just not
a practical guy.

02:22.184 --> 02:24.520
All that's ever mattered
to you is your research,

02:24.603 --> 02:26.981
which is why
I had to bail out your company.

02:27.064 --> 02:29.775
And now it's time
for me to see some return

02:29.859 --> 02:31.444
on my investment.

02:36.282 --> 02:38.868
I want you to solve a problem for me.

02:39.076 --> 02:40.411
What?

02:40.494 --> 02:42.788
Not what, who.

02:43.497 --> 02:46.167
This company has always
meant a great deal to me.

02:46.917 --> 02:48.794
But now, I'm ashamed of it.

02:51.005 --> 02:53.674
Ashamed of the way
it's forgotten its history.

02:54.050 --> 02:57.803
Ashamed of how it's going to
rip the heart out of this city.

02:59.513 --> 03:02.016
I'm referring to a plan
by the current leadership

03:02.099 --> 03:04.769
of Wayne-Powers
to purchase Gotham City's

03:04.852 --> 03:07.188
historical district and then bulldoze it

03:07.271 --> 03:10.232
to make room for another
soulless industrial complex.

03:12.610 --> 03:14.403
Is that what we want?

03:14.904 --> 03:18.699
Or do we want a city
that remembers its history?

03:18.908 --> 03:22.453
A city where ideals
flow from the past,

03:22.661 --> 03:25.664
defining our present
and shaping our future.

03:32.963 --> 03:34.924
The old boy's in rare form today.

03:35.007 --> 03:37.093
He's been on me
for weeks about this.

03:37.176 --> 03:39.512
But it won't be lasting
much longer.

03:39.595 --> 03:41.931
- Why not?
- Because...

03:42.014 --> 03:43.974
Mister Chairman,
I move we convene

03:44.058 --> 03:45.851
a stockholders' meeting
next week

03:45.935 --> 03:48.187
so this matter
can be put to a vote.

03:48.562 --> 03:49.562
Second!

03:49.605 --> 03:50.648
- Yes.
- Yes.

03:50.731 --> 03:52.316
All right.

03:52.400 --> 03:54.485
I'II notify the stockholders.

03:54.568 --> 03:56.112
Meeting adjourned.

04:07.706 --> 04:09.542
- How'd it go?
- The way I wanted.

04:09.625 --> 04:11.770
Must've been pretty important
to get you out of that house.

04:11.794 --> 04:13.337
Especially in daylight.

04:14.255 --> 04:15.464
I'll show you.

04:23.222 --> 04:25.766
The City Council's been trying
to preserve this area.

04:27.143 --> 04:29.270
But you know what it's like
getting extra tax money.

04:29.353 --> 04:31.814
Why spend it on this?
I mean, it's old.

04:31.897 --> 04:34.567
- Who cares?
- I do.

04:35.359 --> 04:39.530
That theater, it was where my parents
and I went the night they were...

04:39.864 --> 04:41.866
I'd think you'd want it
to be torn down.

04:42.032 --> 04:44.410
So maybe after all these years,
you could finally forget.

04:46.454 --> 04:49.290
Do you want to forget
what happened to your father?

04:51.041 --> 04:52.877
Something's bugging the mutt.

05:30.331 --> 05:32.124
Easy, boy. Easy.

05:33.501 --> 05:34.627
What's the matter, boy?

05:51.477 --> 05:53.979
- Earthquake?
- Not like any I've ever been in.

05:54.063 --> 05:55.790
Well, whatever it is,
I could think of better places

05:55.814 --> 05:57.149
to be right now.

06:06.075 --> 06:08.244
- You know this guy?
- Sorry, not one of mine.

06:10.704 --> 06:12.081
Watch out!

06:42.778 --> 06:44.280
So much for memories.

06:46.240 --> 06:47.575
Mr. Wayne!

06:53.247 --> 06:55.791
Now, now, Mr. Wayne,
you know you have to take...

06:55.874 --> 06:57.710
I said get out!

07:01.797 --> 07:04.091
You can go in now, if you want to.

07:06.760 --> 07:08.012
Can you believe it?

07:08.095 --> 07:10.097
They wanna keep me
in here overnight!

07:10.180 --> 07:12.141
Why don't you relax
and make it a little vacation?

07:12.224 --> 07:14.935
And while you're here, I'll figure out
who that guy in the suit was.

07:15.352 --> 07:16.562
So, you're a detective now?

07:16.645 --> 07:18.105
Been watching you long enough.

07:18.188 --> 07:19.857
Besides, I got a lead.

07:22.568 --> 07:24.778
How was I supposed to know
Batman would be there?

07:24.862 --> 07:26.947
Batman's everywhere these days.

07:27.031 --> 07:28.282
Everywhere.

07:28.365 --> 07:30.510
At least I knocked down
one of those buildings for you.

07:30.534 --> 07:32.036
Well, whoopty-doo.

07:32.119 --> 07:33.704
It's the land I want,

07:33.829 --> 07:35.331
and unless I can shut Wayne up,

07:35.414 --> 07:38.250
the stockholders will never
authorize the purchase.

07:38.334 --> 07:39.543
Don't worry.

07:39.627 --> 07:41.962
Next time, I'll get him.
Guaranteed.

07:42.046 --> 07:43.839
Haven't you been listening?
It's over.

07:43.922 --> 07:46.842
Wayne's in the hospital
now, with guards.

07:46.925 --> 07:48.594
There's no way
you can get to him.

07:48.761 --> 07:50.679
I wouldn't be so sure of that.

07:56.518 --> 07:58.103
<i>Bruce...</i>

07:59.980 --> 08:02.316
Who's there?
Where are you?

08:02.441 --> 08:04.068
<i>There 's something you must do.</i>

08:09.365 --> 08:12.117
Okay, we know it's some
kinda sound generator.

08:12.660 --> 08:14.203
So, now what?

08:22.753 --> 08:24.838
Computer, analyze the metal
this thing's made of.

08:27.925 --> 08:30.386
- [Computer?
{automated voice] Incorrect command.

08:31.428 --> 08:34.473
Uh, do the thing where you figure out
what it's made of.

08:34.556 --> 08:36.684
Request
for spectrographic analysis.

08:36.767 --> 08:38.352
Uh, yeah, that's it. What you said.

08:39.978 --> 08:41.689
Analysis proceeding.

08:48.821 --> 08:51.365
"Copper, iron and acoustium"?

08:51.448 --> 08:53.617
Computer, acoustium.

08:55.911 --> 08:58.622
"A new alloy that amplifies
sound vibrations."

08:58.706 --> 09:00.082
Makes sense.

09:00.165 --> 09:02.960
"Developed by Shreeve
Sound Laboratory, Gotham City."

09:04.086 --> 09:07.256
And the old man thought
I couldn't do this stuff on my own.

09:09.508 --> 09:11.719
Go away!
I don't wanna hear you!

09:12.094 --> 09:13.929
<i>It's for your own good. Now, get up.</i>

09:16.724 --> 09:18.726
<i>Go to the window.</i>

09:18.976 --> 09:20.728
- What for?
<i>- Go!</i>

09:28.360 --> 09:29.695
<i>Open it.</i>

09:33.407 --> 09:35.993
<i>Open</i> it. <i>Open</i> it.

09:36.076 --> 09:39.663
<i>Open it. Open it...</i>

09:48.338 --> 09:50.007
<i>You know What you have to do.</i>

09:55.095 --> 09:56.263
Who are you?

09:56.346 --> 09:58.348
Why are you saying
these things to me?

09:58.432 --> 10:00.851
<i>I want</i> to <i>help you.</i> I'm <i>you.</i>

10:01.101 --> 10:02.101
No.

10:02.144 --> 10:03.562
Who <i>else could I</i> be?

10:03.812 --> 10:07.441
- You can't be me!
- Do it.

10:18.911 --> 10:20.996
Mr. Wayne! What's wrong?

10:22.456 --> 10:24.458
Voices. Listen.

10:24.541 --> 10:25.667
Voices?

10:25.751 --> 10:27.002
Can't you hear them?

10:27.085 --> 10:29.379
Maybe you should
get back to bed.

10:31.590 --> 10:33.801
Orderlies! Orderlies!

10:37.179 --> 10:39.139
Do it.

10:48.565 --> 10:50.150
- Can I help you?
- Yeah.

10:51.360 --> 10:53.737
- Here's your pizza, chief.
- I didn't order anything.

10:53.821 --> 10:56.156
Huh? Well, this is the address
I wrote down.

10:56.240 --> 10:57.550
There must be some kinda mistake.

10:57.574 --> 11:00.202
Yeah. Mine.
And now I gotta pay for it.

11:00.577 --> 11:02.120
Extra-large.

11:02.287 --> 11:04.164
Too big for one person.

11:06.291 --> 11:09.461
Sound engineer, huh? That must be
the coolest job in the world.

11:09.545 --> 11:11.421
There are good days
and bad days.

11:13.090 --> 11:14.508
What's this?

11:14.591 --> 11:16.093
Put it to your ear.

11:16.969 --> 11:18.720
Hey, music.

11:18.804 --> 11:21.223
A microfilm
and transmitter receiver.

11:21.306 --> 11:24.101
- Picks up radio signals.
- Cool.

11:24.184 --> 11:26.228
- What's this do?
- Don't touch that!

11:30.107 --> 11:32.067
- What was that?
- Sound masking.

11:33.694 --> 11:35.571
See, sound moves in waves.

11:35.654 --> 11:39.157
The masker instantly plays back
whatever sound it picks up.

11:39.241 --> 11:40.617
Slightly out of phase.

11:40.701 --> 11:42.536
So the waves
cancel each other out.

11:42.619 --> 11:44.121
No waves, no sound.

11:44.204 --> 11:46.290
- Schway.
- Yeah.

11:46.874 --> 11:50.002
Now, it's getting late
and I still have things to do, so...

11:50.085 --> 11:52.045
Wait, what about those, you know,

11:52.129 --> 11:53.672
sound vibrations?

11:53.755 --> 11:56.592
- Sound vibrations?
- Yeah. Heard about 'em the other day.

11:56.675 --> 11:58.035
Some of 'em can knock over a tree?

11:58.093 --> 11:59.303
So they say.

11:59.386 --> 12:02.306
So, uh, you know anything
about 'em?

12:02.598 --> 12:04.641
Who are you?
What do you really want?

12:05.058 --> 12:07.019
Hey, man, I didn't mean nothin'.

12:07.185 --> 12:08.854
You wanna know
about sound vibrations?

12:08.937 --> 12:10.977
Would you like to see
how they can split your skull?

12:14.026 --> 12:15.652
There's no way out!

12:49.227 --> 12:50.896
Hold it right there!

13:12.167 --> 13:13.669
What happened? Is he all right?

13:13.752 --> 13:15.671
He is in the psych ward.

13:15.754 --> 13:18.382
- He started hearing voices.
- Voices?

13:18.465 --> 13:21.343
Age can do tragic things
to a person.

13:21.927 --> 13:23.804
But I wouldn't worry about it.

13:23.887 --> 13:25.722
He is going to be
in the best of hands.

13:26.181 --> 13:27.516
Mine.

13:34.856 --> 13:36.942
Who else can take care
of his affairs?

13:37.025 --> 13:39.319
He has no wife, no children.

13:39.695 --> 13:41.405
Me. I could do it.

13:42.906 --> 13:45.867
- Awfully young, aren't you?
- Awfully slimy, aren't you?

13:45.951 --> 13:47.202
Careful.

13:47.285 --> 13:49.955
The courts are very strict
about slander.

13:50.038 --> 13:52.332
Yeah? Then let's see
how they handle assault.

13:57.879 --> 14:00.674
You should know something
about the psych ward here.

14:00.924 --> 14:03.427
There's always room for one more.

14:15.230 --> 14:16.648
The police know about me.

14:16.732 --> 14:17.858
I'm a wanted man.

14:17.941 --> 14:19.693
I can never go back
to my lab again.

14:19.776 --> 14:21.445
And it's all your fault.

14:23.155 --> 14:25.323
That's not going to help.

14:25.407 --> 14:27.451
No, but it'll make me feel better.

14:27.534 --> 14:29.202
You should be feeling fine, anyway.

14:29.327 --> 14:30.787
And why is that?

14:30.871 --> 14:33.331
Because your costume gives you power.

14:33.540 --> 14:36.668
Real power.
Ever had that before?

14:36.918 --> 14:38.503
No. Not really.

14:38.587 --> 14:41.506
It's no small thing. Trust me.

14:41.590 --> 14:44.718
But I can't show my face anymore.
Or use my name.

14:44.801 --> 14:47.345
The face is no loss,
and if you miss your name,

14:47.429 --> 14:48.555
I'll give you another one.

14:48.722 --> 14:50.640
One that fits your new persona.

14:52.517 --> 14:55.520
- Shriek.
- Shriek?

14:55.604 --> 14:58.732
Not a friendly name,
I grant you, but take it from me.

14:58.815 --> 15:01.234
It's better to be feared than loved.

15:01.777 --> 15:03.195
Shriek.

15:03.278 --> 15:05.697
Now go forth and do damage.

15:05.781 --> 15:08.825
But don't forget,
you still owe me Bruce Wayne.

15:09.242 --> 15:11.453
What if Batman
gets into it again?

15:11.661 --> 15:12.661
Kill him.

15:16.833 --> 15:19.503
The food, it's poisoned.

15:20.045 --> 15:21.605
<i>- They'ra trying to kill you.</i>
- Shut <i>up!</i>

15:21.671 --> 15:24.800
Don 't <i>eat.</i>

15:28.678 --> 15:30.305
Quiet!

15:30.847 --> 15:32.140
Quiet.

15:43.985 --> 15:46.238
I've been hearing these voices.

15:46.321 --> 15:47.364
I know.

15:47.447 --> 15:49.157
They think I'm crazy.

15:49.282 --> 15:50.575
We'll talk about it back home.

15:50.659 --> 15:53.203
We're not going anywhere
until I figure out

15:53.286 --> 15:54.830
where the voices are coming from.

15:54.913 --> 15:56.682
But the orderlies
could come in at any second.

15:56.706 --> 15:58.250
Check the light fixture.

15:58.333 --> 15:59.960
There might be
a speaker hidden in it.

16:00.043 --> 16:01.837
- You can't be serious.
- Check it!

16:04.172 --> 16:05.590
See. Nothing.

16:05.674 --> 16:07.801
Then the sound's got to be
coming from the walls.

16:07.884 --> 16:10.720
- Strip 'em.
- I can't strip the...

16:10.804 --> 16:12.472
Wait a minute.

16:13.181 --> 16:14.224
What are you doing?

16:14.349 --> 16:15.349
OW!

16:16.351 --> 16:18.186
Big bandage for such a small wound.

16:19.604 --> 16:22.399
It's a two-way radio.
Guy named Shreeve makes 'em.

16:22.482 --> 16:24.335
He's the one who knocked
down the police station.

16:24.359 --> 16:27.946
He probably bribed a nurse
to put that thing in the bandage.

16:28.446 --> 16:31.116
- Still think I'm crazy?
- It never occurred to me.

16:38.039 --> 16:40.125
- Miss me, boy?
- He wasn't the only one.

16:48.592 --> 16:51.392
Looks like the radio signal's coming
from that factory by the hospital.

16:51.469 --> 16:53.054
<i>And from there,
I've got a feeling</i>

16:53.138 --> 16:54.723
<i>it's gonna lead to Powers.</i>

16:54.806 --> 16:56.892
Doesn't take a detective
to figure that one out.

17:08.028 --> 17:09.948
Yeah, the source is definitely
in here somewhere.

17:10.030 --> 17:13.241
Not somewhere.
Right behind you.

17:13.825 --> 17:16.161
- You don't have to do this, Shreeve.
- But I do.

17:16.578 --> 17:18.705
And the name's Shriek now.

17:19.080 --> 17:21.374
I'II show you why.

17:46.233 --> 17:47.859
This isn't going to help you.

18:47.085 --> 18:49.296
Kinda quiet out there, huh, boy?

18:49.671 --> 18:51.673
But you hear something, don't you?

19:30.628 --> 19:31.880
Get up.

19:39.846 --> 19:40.972
No.

19:41.056 --> 19:43.725
No!

19:45.268 --> 19:46.936
It has been moved and seconded

19:47.020 --> 19:49.647
that Wayne-Powers
tender an offer to the city

19:49.731 --> 19:52.484
in order to expand
into the historical district.

19:52.859 --> 19:54.778
All in favor.

19:54.861 --> 19:56.488
Aye!

19:56.738 --> 19:57.822
Opposed.

19:57.906 --> 19:59.407
Nay!

19:59.657 --> 20:01.576
The motion is defeated.

20:02.243 --> 20:03.536
Meeting adjourned!

20:06.790 --> 20:09.751
Too bad Shreeve's too freaked out
to testify against that weasel.

20:09.834 --> 20:12.045
Maybe when his
hearing comes back.

20:12.128 --> 20:14.547
- If it ever does.
- Tell me something.

20:14.672 --> 20:17.217
Why were you so sure
those voices weren't coming from you?

20:17.384 --> 20:19.928
Well, first,
I know I'm not psychotic.

20:20.011 --> 20:22.013
I hope your other reason's
more convincing.

20:22.097 --> 20:24.891
And second,
the voice kept calling me Bruce.

20:25.308 --> 20:27.727
In my mind,
that's not what I call myself.

20:27.852 --> 20:29.521
What do you call yourself?

20:31.940 --> 20:34.275
Oh, yeah. I suppose you would.

20:35.026 --> 20:37.278
- But that's my name now.
- Hmm.

20:37.362 --> 20:39.239
Tell that to my subconscious.
