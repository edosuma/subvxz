00:46.463 --> 00:48.131
<i>
I'm back.</i>

00:48.131 --> 00:49.925
<i>Back to what my mother
and everyone else</i>

00:49.925 --> 00:52.469
<i>said was my destiny
no matter how many fights</i>

00:52.469 --> 00:54.513
<i>I won or millions I earned.</i>

00:54.513 --> 00:57.015
<i>Right back where I started, man.</i>

00:57.015 --> 00:58.976
Maybe this is who I am.

01:02.562 --> 01:05.524
<i>Racing pigeons
can fly 1,000 miles.</i>

01:05.524 --> 01:06.817
<i>But they always come
right back to that</i>

01:06.817 --> 01:08.151
<i>dirty box they call home.</i>

01:12.197 --> 01:14.283
Six years
might as well be life.

01:17.578 --> 01:20.247
I'm 25, in my prime.

01:20.247 --> 01:22.249
Snatching the title back from
Buster would've been cake.

01:25.335 --> 01:28.338
But when I get out,
I'll be 30 fuckin' 1.

01:28.338 --> 01:30.173
Not a lot of 31-year-old
champions

01:30.173 --> 01:32.259
of the world out there.

01:32.259 --> 01:35.762
Especially after six years
of no training, bad food.

01:35.762 --> 01:37.598
Bend and spread.

01:37.598 --> 01:40.225
<i>Prison steals
everything it can from you.</i>

01:40.225 --> 01:42.686
<i>Every hope I had
is all fucked up now.</i>

01:42.686 --> 01:46.523
Who will I be when
I get out of here?

01:47.899 --> 01:50.527
Welcome home, Champ.

01:53.530 --> 01:56.533
And by then,
will anyone even care?

01:56.533 --> 01:59.161
Hey, Mike.

01:59.161 --> 02:01.330
I'm Ray Ray.

02:09.004 --> 02:10.630
<i>
I feel a little bad about</i>

02:10.630 --> 02:12.424
<i>how Ray Ray and I got started.</i>

02:12.424 --> 02:14.259
<i>But it was fucking prison, man.</i>

02:14.259 --> 02:16.053
<i>I needed to claim that shit.</i>

02:16.053 --> 02:18.930
<i>I wasn't about to be
anyone's bitch.</i>

02:18.930 --> 02:21.558
Can you imagine livin'
with me in a 8x9 foot cell?

02:23.435 --> 02:26.605
Ray Ray turned out to be
more patient than Job, man.

02:26.605 --> 02:29.358
Ray Ray tried to keep me
out of trouble.

02:29.358 --> 02:31.443
As if anyone had ever
succeeded at that.

02:34.488 --> 02:36.323
Now's the time for you
to figure out

02:36.323 --> 02:38.742
what you're gonna do when you
get out of this place.

02:38.742 --> 02:40.577
But you got time
to figure that shit out.

02:42.621 --> 02:44.581
Keep fuckin' around, though,

02:44.581 --> 02:46.666
the System'll steal
your future from you.

02:46.666 --> 02:49.252
Take it from one who knows.

02:49.252 --> 02:52.214
I ain't got no future.

02:52.214 --> 02:54.549
You wanna
make this worth something?

02:54.549 --> 02:55.967
Read books.

02:55.967 --> 02:57.552
Real ones.

02:57.552 --> 02:59.471
Starting with The Constitution.

02:59.471 --> 03:01.348
Fuck you.

03:05.936 --> 03:08.522
Those first months,
I had to prove I wasn't a punk.

03:08.522 --> 03:10.232
Because everyone was
looking to make their name

03:10.232 --> 03:12.150
by taking a shot at me.

03:12.150 --> 03:13.985
Or so I thought.

03:15.946 --> 03:17.280
You eat that shit.

03:17.280 --> 03:19.032
Probably pissed in it,
creepy fuck.

03:19.032 --> 03:20.409
Damn!

03:27.582 --> 03:30.710
Tyson, you tree jumper fuck!

03:32.379 --> 03:34.381
Tree jumper?

03:34.381 --> 03:36.550
Never heard
that one before.

03:36.550 --> 03:38.635
Sir, tree jumper.

03:38.635 --> 03:40.595
What do you think it mean?

03:40.595 --> 03:43.640
Uh, probably
some kind of racial, uh...

03:43.640 --> 03:45.100
"You're a monkey,
climbing trees."

03:46.643 --> 03:48.353
You know, I should kick
your ass for saying that.

03:48.353 --> 03:49.896
You're wrong.

03:49.896 --> 03:51.648
Turns out it's a nickname
for a rapist

03:51.648 --> 03:53.024
hiding behind a tree,

03:53.024 --> 03:55.986
waiting for women to walk by
so he can pounce on them.

03:55.986 --> 03:58.363
I ain't fuckin'
do nothin' like that.

03:58.363 --> 04:00.323
<i>So I let him know
he'd been misinformed.</i>

04:01.450 --> 04:04.411
They put me
in solitary for that one.

04:04.411 --> 04:07.122
Alone in a small dark pit
23 hours a day

04:07.122 --> 04:09.207
with nothing but my thoughts.

04:09.207 --> 04:11.084
And my thoughts weren't
that healthy to begin with.

04:21.303 --> 04:23.638
It's designed to murder hope.

04:23.638 --> 04:25.265
It works.

04:25.265 --> 04:27.517
Psst, Mike!

04:27.517 --> 04:28.768
Big fan.

04:28.768 --> 04:30.270
I brought you your mail, homie.

04:38.945 --> 04:40.489
Keep the faith.

04:40.489 --> 04:44.367
We are showin' up strong.
I put the article in here.

04:44.367 --> 04:46.912
The people love you, Mike.

04:46.912 --> 04:47.996
<i>
People were talking.</i>

04:47.996 --> 04:49.956
We will not
let Desiree

04:49.956 --> 04:51.792
get away with using us

04:51.792 --> 04:55.212
to destroy one of the greatest
men we've ever known!

04:55.212 --> 04:57.255
<i>I had my supporters,</i>

04:57.255 --> 04:58.632
<i>including this guy.</i>

04:58.632 --> 05:00.467
We're gonna argue
that Desiree perjured herself.

05:00.467 --> 05:01.927
She denied
retaining an attorney

05:01.927 --> 05:03.053
to go after you
in that civil court

05:03.053 --> 05:04.930
before the criminal case
even started.

05:04.930 --> 05:07.474
Meaning she is all
about the money, honey!

05:07.474 --> 05:09.017
<i>
Alan Dershowitz,</i>

05:09.017 --> 05:10.894
Harvard professor.

05:10.894 --> 05:13.021
Best lawyer in the world.

05:13.021 --> 05:15.315
More like all talk, big bill.

05:15.315 --> 05:17.734
An albino Don King.

05:17.734 --> 05:19.152
I lost my appeal,

05:19.152 --> 05:22.113
and the Indiana Supreme Court
refused to review it.

05:22.113 --> 05:24.115
That's the day I lost faith
in The System.

05:24.115 --> 05:25.450
Time got real.

05:32.666 --> 05:34.376
Ah, fuck.

05:36.002 --> 05:38.380
You gotta stop
fucking with the guards.

05:47.097 --> 05:49.099
From my sister.

05:57.983 --> 06:00.652
They can't break Iron Mike.

06:03.363 --> 06:05.991
Can I borrow that?

06:05.991 --> 06:07.492
- The Constitution?
- Yeah.

06:13.248 --> 06:14.874
Better yet.

06:14.874 --> 06:17.127
Keep it.

06:21.590 --> 06:22.716
It was hard
for me to believe people

06:22.716 --> 06:23.800
telling me
I had a bright future--

06:23.800 --> 06:27.137
Barkim, Cus, now Ray Ray.

06:27.137 --> 06:28.847
I came from shit.

06:28.847 --> 06:30.849
As far as I knew,
I was shit.

06:30.849 --> 06:33.602
Now, I know some of y'all think
I deserved to be locked up.

06:33.602 --> 06:35.478
Agree to disagree.

06:35.478 --> 06:38.607
Point is, I became just
another nigga with a number.

06:38.607 --> 06:41.276
And in the '90s, niggas
with numbers was big business.

06:45.989 --> 06:47.365
You gotta understand.

06:47.365 --> 06:49.534
In the '90s,
there was a war on "drugs."

06:49.534 --> 06:51.202
<i>GEORGE H.W. BUSH:
This...</i>

06:51.202 --> 06:53.872
<i>this is crack cocaine,</i>

06:53.872 --> 06:57.834
<i>seized a few days ago
by drug enforcement agents</i>

06:57.834 --> 07:01.379
<i>in a park just across the
street from the White House.</i>

07:01.379 --> 07:02.922
Ray Ray's bag
was half that size,

07:02.922 --> 07:05.508
and they took half his life.

07:05.508 --> 07:08.386
<i>It was 100 to 1 disparity
between the amount of cocaine</i>

07:08.386 --> 07:12.182
<i>that triggered a mandatory
minimum sentence versus crack.</i>

07:12.182 --> 07:16.269
<i>And you wanna know why there's
so many brothas in here?</i>

07:16.269 --> 07:18.229
In an Indiana cornfield?

07:18.229 --> 07:21.149
'Cause white boys selling
coke got suspended sentences,

07:21.149 --> 07:23.485
while brothas selling crack
got 20 years.

07:23.485 --> 07:25.028
<i>GEORGE H.W. BUSH:
We need more prisons,</i>

07:25.028 --> 07:28.156
<i>more jails, more courts,
more prosecutors.</i>

07:28.156 --> 07:29.699
Even with all
those new prisons,

07:29.699 --> 07:32.077
we were packed tight
and wound tighter.

07:32.077 --> 07:33.411
These people
don't need prisons.

07:33.411 --> 07:36.039
They need psychiatrists,
myself included.

07:36.039 --> 07:39.834
But it's not about correction,
it's about punishment.

07:39.834 --> 07:42.003
<i>Treat people like animals...</i>

07:42.003 --> 07:44.464
Who the <i>fuck</i>
do you think you are?

07:44.464 --> 07:47.050
<i>
They're gonna fuckin' roar.</i>

07:50.261 --> 07:52.430
<i>Ah, what can I say?
I'm a stubborn fuck.</i>

07:53.848 --> 07:55.517
Let's go.

07:55.517 --> 07:57.060
<i>
But so was Ray Ray.</i>

07:57.060 --> 08:00.897
<i>And eventually, he got me
reading all kinds of shit.</i>

08:00.897 --> 08:04.401
Better than comic books,
Young Blood?

08:04.401 --> 08:07.237
Not better, but interesting.

08:07.237 --> 08:09.781
He never let the pigs
get him down.

08:09.781 --> 08:12.033
Even in prison.

08:12.033 --> 08:14.244
He saw The System
for how it really works.

08:15.537 --> 08:17.080
Don King used to say

08:17.080 --> 08:18.289
he didn't serve
his prison time,

08:18.289 --> 08:20.750
his prison time served him.

08:20.750 --> 08:22.460
I never knew what he
was talking about.

08:22.460 --> 08:23.837
Now, you do.

08:25.714 --> 08:29.426
Inmate number 856951,
time to go.

08:29.426 --> 08:30.677
What's this about?

08:30.677 --> 08:32.429
Oh, you're being
transferred to Supermax,

08:32.429 --> 08:33.430
effective immediately.

08:33.430 --> 08:34.806
What?

08:34.806 --> 08:36.975
This don't make no sense!

08:36.975 --> 08:39.269
- Hey, let him go!
- Ah, ah, ah, ah!

08:39.269 --> 08:40.687
Gimme an excuse.

08:41.396 --> 08:43.189
My people ain't
gonna know where I am!

08:43.189 --> 08:44.983
Mike, call my sister!

08:44.983 --> 08:49.195
317-555-0153!

08:49.195 --> 08:50.655
Mike, call my sister!

08:50.655 --> 08:54.617
317-555-0153!

08:56.953 --> 08:58.705
<i>
I never saw Ray Ray again,</i>

08:58.705 --> 09:00.081
<i>and I was looking for revenge.</i>

09:00.081 --> 09:01.458
Mike Tyson.

09:01.458 --> 09:03.168
<i>And thanks to the
stupid fucking guards,</i>

09:03.168 --> 09:05.420
<i>I found it.</i>
- Lloyd Franklin.

09:06.963 --> 09:09.215
Shut the fuck up
and don't touch my shit.

09:11.176 --> 09:13.219
I know Ray Ray
taught you better.

09:14.387 --> 09:16.306
When I got
transferred here in '88,

09:16.306 --> 09:17.932
Ray Ray showed me the terrain.

09:19.976 --> 09:22.187
Like your fan mail,
for example.

09:22.187 --> 09:24.105
Solid gold, brotha.

09:27.025 --> 09:29.319
"As per your request,
I have deposited $50

09:29.319 --> 09:30.445
"in your commissary account.

09:30.445 --> 09:31.696
God Bless you, Champion."

09:31.696 --> 09:33.198
That's like $1,000 already.

09:33.198 --> 09:34.866
Uh-uh, move that
decimal point, playboy.

09:34.866 --> 09:37.577
More like 10,000, and rising.

09:37.577 --> 09:39.412
This young lady sent photos.

09:39.412 --> 09:41.289
"Vicky"?

09:41.289 --> 09:43.291
Even the uglies
get 40 in trade.

09:43.291 --> 09:45.043
<i>
But like any solid franchise,</i>

09:45.043 --> 09:46.628
<i>it expanded quickly.</i>

09:50.840 --> 09:53.885
This joint
was ripe for a takeover.

09:53.885 --> 09:56.888
<i>It was like</i> Let's Make a Deal,
<i>prison edition,</i>

09:56.888 --> 09:58.932
<i>and I was Monty fucking Hall.</i>

09:58.932 --> 10:00.767
'Kay, sweetie,
I'm gonna put you on the phone

10:00.767 --> 10:01.768
with my good buddy...

10:01.768 --> 10:03.019
- Cephus.
- Cephus.

10:03.019 --> 10:05.271
I want you
to show him a good time, okay?

10:07.440 --> 10:08.900
Hi.

10:08.900 --> 10:11.653
<i>
Man, fuck the outside world.</i>

10:11.653 --> 10:14.823
<i>In here, I don't need to
train every morning at 5:00.</i>

10:14.823 --> 10:16.783
<i>I don't need to be
beating up motherfuckers</i>

10:16.783 --> 10:19.118
<i>for your entertainment.</i>

10:19.118 --> 10:21.371
<i>In here, I'm an entrepreneur.</i>

10:23.081 --> 10:25.542
<i>
Safe, pressure's off.</i>

10:35.051 --> 10:37.637
<i>I had everyone
on the inside working for me.</i>

10:37.637 --> 10:40.140
<i>Shit, I even had this dumb
motherfucker bring me donuts.</i>

10:44.894 --> 10:46.896
So I was
the King of the Prison,

10:46.896 --> 10:48.940
and I liked it that way.

10:48.940 --> 10:51.401
What I wanted was to just
stay in prison and hide.

10:51.401 --> 10:53.528
Outside felt like prison.

10:53.528 --> 10:54.904
And I'm--you know,
I'm just being real

10:54.904 --> 10:56.114
with you guys right now.

10:56.114 --> 10:57.657
I just kept
pushing the envelope

10:57.657 --> 10:58.992
with the kind of shit
I was getting into.

10:58.992 --> 11:01.661
But instead of tacking
more time on my sentence,

11:01.661 --> 11:03.204
they just kept
shaving it off

11:03.204 --> 11:04.747
for my "good behavior."

11:07.166 --> 11:08.626
You sure about this?

11:08.626 --> 11:10.044
They'll throw the book at you
for sure if you get caught.

11:10.044 --> 11:11.921
Don't worry about it.

11:11.921 --> 11:13.381
A'ight.

11:14.549 --> 11:15.842
Don't say I didn't warn you.

11:33.318 --> 11:35.904
<i>
It was the perfect cover.</i>

11:35.904 --> 11:39.198
<i>I stayed
out of their Islam shit,</i>

11:39.198 --> 11:41.117
<i>they stayed out of my shit.</i>

11:49.959 --> 11:53.254
<i>We started spending
a lot of time there.</i>

11:55.423 --> 11:56.883
<i>These guys
were always busy</i>

11:56.883 --> 11:58.218
<i>praying to their higher power.</i>

12:01.429 --> 12:02.931
<i>
I had my own higher power.</i>

12:08.770 --> 12:11.147
<i>They never said
a fucking word to me.</i>

12:11.147 --> 12:12.732
<i>Until one day.
Hey, Champ.</i>

12:12.732 --> 12:14.901
Champ, check this out.

12:14.901 --> 12:17.236
$900 value, all right?
You can get faxes on this shit.

12:17.236 --> 12:18.529
One hour battery life.

12:18.529 --> 12:19.822
You even got a stylus
and you can write

12:19.822 --> 12:21.115
in your calendar,
you know what I'm saying?

12:21.115 --> 12:22.283
I'm in jail, nigga.

12:22.283 --> 12:24.452
What kinda appointments
I'm makin'?

12:24.452 --> 12:25.870
- You right, Champ, you right.
- Yeah.

12:25.870 --> 12:27.205
So, I mean,
if you don't want it--

12:27.205 --> 12:28.456
Just take
this shit out of here.

12:28.456 --> 12:29.457
Okay, all right.

12:31.292 --> 12:33.586
The new toy of yours
won't work.

12:33.586 --> 12:35.254
Bullshit, it's a phone.

12:35.254 --> 12:37.256
Ain't nothing but a brick.

12:37.256 --> 12:38.967
Unless it talk
to the upstairs.

12:40.927 --> 12:43.304
Satellite.

12:43.304 --> 12:46.766
We don't get
that kind of signal out here.

12:46.766 --> 12:49.477
You use this space
to transact your business.

12:51.813 --> 12:54.315
But you always stay
for the prayers.

12:55.358 --> 12:58.569
You could join us in prayer,
if you like.

12:58.569 --> 13:00.822
The only thing I ask

13:00.822 --> 13:02.824
is that you remove your shoes.

13:06.411 --> 13:08.246
<i>At first,
the appeal of Islam was</i>

13:08.246 --> 13:09.872
<i>they're just
the baddest of the bad.</i>

13:09.872 --> 13:12.417
<i>First time I saw it was
Don's chauffeur, Captain Joe.</i>

13:12.417 --> 13:13.543
Ali is a multimillionaire!

13:13.543 --> 13:15.128
Larry Holmes
a multimillionaire.

13:15.128 --> 13:17.213
Mike Tyson sleeps
on a bed of money!

13:17.213 --> 13:19.757
I make you HBO motherfuckers
a fortune.

13:19.757 --> 13:21.175
You love my Black ass!

13:21.175 --> 13:24.262
So don't waste my
motherfucking time!

13:26.097 --> 13:28.808
I need something to eat.

13:28.808 --> 13:30.393
This bean pie's
pretty delicious.

13:30.393 --> 13:31.853
- Mm.
<i>- Man,</i>

13:31.853 --> 13:33.521
<i>Captain Joe was no joke.</i>

13:33.521 --> 13:35.648
<i>This dude taught Malcolm X,</i>

13:35.648 --> 13:37.358
<i>and he was
Elijah Muhammad's ace.</i>

13:38.860 --> 13:40.945
Now I'm sitting here trying
to make motherfuckers money.

13:40.945 --> 13:42.363
I tell you
I need something to eat,

13:42.363 --> 13:43.656
and the best thing
you can come up with

13:43.656 --> 13:45.074
is a motherfucking bean pie?

13:45.074 --> 13:46.826
God damn it!

13:46.826 --> 13:49.370
I need some real food!

13:50.413 --> 13:53.207
Pick it up, fry it up.

13:53.207 --> 13:55.126
Come on.

13:55.126 --> 13:57.795
You know I don't touch pork.

13:57.795 --> 14:00.214
Then motherfucker, you fired.

14:09.474 --> 14:11.851
What'd you do that for, Don?

14:11.851 --> 14:13.394
Mike, sometimes

14:13.394 --> 14:16.147
you got to show these
motherfuckers who's in charge.

14:16.147 --> 14:17.774
I said
I'll call you tomorrow.

14:17.774 --> 14:19.859
And don't worry about HBO.
They'll come around.

14:19.859 --> 14:22.779
They always do.

14:28.493 --> 14:30.119
Who the fuck
are these niggas?

14:30.119 --> 14:31.871
Brother King.

14:31.871 --> 14:34.123
I'm here
to respectfully convey

14:34.123 --> 14:36.751
Captain Joe
is never terminated.

14:37.710 --> 14:40.004
If anyone is to be terminated,

14:40.004 --> 14:42.256
it will be you.

14:42.256 --> 14:44.967
<i>Yeah, Don didn't fuck
with Captain Joe after that.</i>

14:49.555 --> 14:51.182
<i>These guys
were bad motherfuckers,</i>

14:51.182 --> 14:53.976
<i>but they also had some really
interesting stuff to say.</i>

14:53.976 --> 14:55.353
You--

14:56.646 --> 14:59.315
It's chicken,
it's not pork.

15:04.987 --> 15:07.156
I should probably jog more.

15:07.156 --> 15:08.950
There's no boxing in here.

15:08.950 --> 15:10.368
Indiana prison rules.

15:12.120 --> 15:13.746
That's all external.

15:16.624 --> 15:21.295
How exactly do you intend
to address your flabby spirit?

15:23.297 --> 15:25.758
You got
less than a year in here,

15:25.758 --> 15:28.094
if you manage
to stay out of trouble.

15:30.304 --> 15:33.141
But the true freedom?

15:33.141 --> 15:35.768
The true freedom...

15:35.768 --> 15:38.771
comes from elevating
above base pursuits.

15:42.358 --> 15:45.153
Are you ready to do that?

15:45.153 --> 15:47.238
<i>The fucking guy
knew his shit.</i>

15:47.238 --> 15:49.240
<i>I gotta say, I liked him.</i>

15:49.240 --> 15:52.577
<i>Nobody had talked to me
like that since Cus.</i>

15:52.577 --> 15:56.247
I had to get in shape
spiritually, then physically.

15:56.247 --> 15:58.833
You know, Don only cared
about the second part.

15:58.833 --> 16:00.960
I had maybe six months left
and he was hyping the world

16:00.960 --> 16:03.087
for my triumphant return.

16:03.087 --> 16:04.797
Every million dollars
added to my purse

16:04.797 --> 16:07.091
was another million pounds
of pressure,

16:07.091 --> 16:10.094
scaring me shitless about
whether I could still bring it.

16:10.094 --> 16:11.721
For all of you.

16:11.721 --> 16:14.307
I mean, if you even
still wanted to see me.

16:14.307 --> 16:16.392
Ah, man,
I was freaking the fuck out.

16:16.392 --> 16:18.769
So I asked for help.

16:22.148 --> 16:25.776
Dr. Angelou, I didn't--
I didn't think you'd show.

16:25.776 --> 16:27.403
You asked.

16:27.403 --> 16:30.698
And if I'm being honest,

16:30.698 --> 16:35.077
I'm not exactly sure
what I can say to you.

16:35.077 --> 16:38.289
But if a word from me can help,

16:38.289 --> 16:42.084
then certainly
I can find that word.

16:42.084 --> 16:45.630
Still, even with all
they're saying about me...

16:45.630 --> 16:49.217
I approach people
as they are now,

16:49.217 --> 16:53.095
without judgment
for what they have been.

16:53.095 --> 16:56.182
Even Mike Tyson.

16:56.182 --> 16:59.977
That we all have
the possibility of becoming.

16:59.977 --> 17:01.520
"You may write me
down in history

17:01.520 --> 17:03.606
"with your bitter,
twisted lies.

17:03.606 --> 17:05.399
"You may trod me in the dirt,

17:05.399 --> 17:08.027
but still, like dust,
I'll rise."

17:08.027 --> 17:09.862
I love when someone

17:09.862 --> 17:11.906
quotes me to me.

17:11.906 --> 17:15.952
I wish I was as knowledgeable
about prizefighting.

17:15.952 --> 17:18.162
Well, the thing is,
I've been really trying.

17:18.162 --> 17:22.959
Been training again,
and even better, reading.

17:22.959 --> 17:25.711
I'm just trying to be
a better man, you know?

17:25.711 --> 17:28.798
For you or for them?

17:31.425 --> 17:36.806
Where does that leave you when
you're not their Champ anymore?

17:44.146 --> 17:46.816
Don't touch him.

17:46.816 --> 17:49.777
You can be more than that.

17:52.029 --> 17:54.490
Excuse me, officer.

17:54.490 --> 17:58.244
Would you be so kind as to

17:58.244 --> 18:03.874
take a picture of me
and Mr. Tyson?

18:15.553 --> 18:18.264
It's beautiful, brotha.

18:18.264 --> 18:21.767
Maya be reppin' the culture
for real.

18:21.767 --> 18:23.561
50.

18:23.561 --> 18:25.438
Say what?

18:25.438 --> 18:27.815
For the photo.
50 bucks.

18:27.815 --> 18:29.608
<i>Yeah,
I sold the picture...</i>

18:29.608 --> 18:31.694
And donuts.
<i>Do you know how hard it is</i>

18:31.694 --> 18:34.322
<i>to get fucking donuts
in prison?</i>

18:41.454 --> 18:45.082
<i>But those words,
they stayed with me.</i>

18:49.045 --> 18:51.589
The thing is,
no fighter in history

18:51.589 --> 18:54.425
ever got back on top
after three years away.

18:54.425 --> 18:56.594
No one ever came out
of prison in one piece.

18:56.594 --> 19:01.098
Mentally, spiritually,
anything else.

19:01.098 --> 19:03.559
What made everyone think
I would be the one?

19:05.811 --> 19:08.064
The world is waiting
for your return tomorrow.

19:08.064 --> 19:10.149
Not mine, Mike Tyson's.

19:10.149 --> 19:13.194
Don says
he's worth $100 million.

19:13.194 --> 19:15.321
What's Mike Tyson worth?

19:15.321 --> 19:17.573
Mike Tyson ain't worth shit.

19:17.573 --> 19:19.992
Mike Tyson feels safer in here.

19:19.992 --> 19:22.828
And why do you think that is?

19:22.828 --> 19:24.455
I know
what you're trying to do.

19:24.455 --> 19:25.915
You're trying to say
this is Allah's way

19:25.915 --> 19:27.917
of telling me
to leave The Game behind.

19:27.917 --> 19:30.586
Devote my life to what?

19:30.586 --> 19:33.047
Look, I walk out
these doors tomorrow.

19:33.047 --> 19:34.799
I don't need no more
riddles or stories,

19:34.799 --> 19:35.925
none of that bullshit.

19:35.925 --> 19:38.344
Just tell me what
the fuck I need to do.

19:57.571 --> 20:00.574
Mike Tyson.

20:00.574 --> 20:03.494
You serve no one but Allah.

20:05.162 --> 20:07.790
And with that knowledge,

20:07.790 --> 20:10.334
you can choose
whatever path you want.

20:14.422 --> 20:17.716
<i>Man, I was terrified
to walk out those doors.</i>

20:17.716 --> 20:20.177
<i>My life was so
out of control out there.</i>

20:20.177 --> 20:23.139
<i>In prison, I made
the rules and I ran things.</i>

20:23.139 --> 20:25.015
<i>In prayer,
I was finally able to make</i>

20:25.015 --> 20:27.476
<i>all those outside voices
shut the fuck up.</i>

20:31.063 --> 20:34.442
Peace and mercy
in Allah be on you.

20:34.442 --> 20:38.028
Peace and mercy in Allah
be on you.

20:39.738 --> 20:41.532
All right, Mike.
♪ It ain't your day ♪

20:41.532 --> 20:43.993
- Time to go.
- ♪ I lost my mind ♪

20:47.913 --> 20:49.915
<i>What if I
couldn't fight no more?</i>

20:49.915 --> 20:52.251
<i>I was just so scared
you guys were gonna hate me.</i>

20:52.251 --> 20:54.545
<i>But I was
just as scared of going back</i>

20:54.545 --> 20:56.672
<i>to the old, fucked up Mike.</i>

20:56.672 --> 20:58.257
<i>The guy who had everyone,
including me,</i>

20:58.257 --> 21:01.093
<i>convinced I was gonna
end up in an early grave.</i>

21:05.097 --> 21:06.515
<i>
Those were my choices.</i>

21:15.024 --> 21:18.152
<i>I could go back
to being Cus's monster.</i>

21:18.152 --> 21:21.405
<i>Don's meal ticket.</i>

21:21.405 --> 21:25.117
<i>Or I could be
the elevated man Ray Ray,</i>

21:25.117 --> 21:27.578
<i>Imam Siddiq,
and Maya saw inside of me...</i>

21:30.247 --> 21:31.499
<i>
That I wanted to be.</i>

21:33.042 --> 21:34.752
<i>
And I had to decide now.</i>
