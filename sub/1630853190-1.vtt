WEBVTT

00:03.304 --> 00:06.774
What is it?

00:06.874 --> 00:09.677
What isn't it?

00:09.777 --> 00:13.347
It's a nine-layer brunch dip.
Combines all your favorites.

00:13.447 --> 00:14.815
Thank you for filling out
my Google survey.

00:14.915 --> 00:16.417
I'm still not sure
why I had to tell you

00:16.517 --> 00:18.286
what deodorant I use.

00:18.386 --> 00:20.121
'Cause you smell
like an angel.

00:20.221 --> 00:23.224
For Carly, we have oatmeal,
berries and bacon.

00:23.324 --> 00:24.592
For Freddie, we've got
grapes, coffee

00:24.692 --> 00:26.427
and leftover pizza.

00:26.527 --> 00:29.163
And for Harper we've got
figs, caviar,

00:29.263 --> 00:30.764
spicy Bloody Mary.

00:30.864 --> 00:32.400
Dig in.

00:37.571 --> 00:39.740
Hey, Freddie, should you
be having a mimosa?

00:39.840 --> 00:41.742
I thought you were
on antibiotics for your...

00:41.842 --> 00:45.246
special friend in your...
special place.

00:45.346 --> 00:48.048
Oh, you mean my penis parasite?

00:48.149 --> 00:49.283
I'm good.

00:49.383 --> 00:51.185
After two months
of round-the-clock meds,

00:51.285 --> 00:52.786
I can pee standing up again.

00:52.886 --> 00:55.256
It's a brand-new day
for my genitals.

00:55.356 --> 00:58.526
Did you see? There's a new
episode of my favorite show.

00:58.626 --> 01:01.562
Oh, no, don't tell me
Wes and Beau made a new one.

01:01.662 --> 01:03.297
Okay, I won't tell you.

01:03.397 --> 01:04.965
Showing hurts more.

01:05.065 --> 01:06.267
Wake up, nation.

01:06.367 --> 01:07.801
I'm Wes,
this is my boy Beau,

01:07.901 --> 01:10.138
and we're here
with another episode of...

01:10.238 --> 01:11.839
The Weau Bros Show.

01:11.939 --> 01:15.409
Beau, my man, how are you
feeling today?

01:15.509 --> 01:19.613
Good, but, uh, also like... mad.

01:19.713 --> 01:22.183
Beau and I saved Carly's life
at Webicon,

01:22.283 --> 01:23.684
an event she dragged us to...

01:23.784 --> 01:25.319
on my Nonna's half-birthday.

01:25.419 --> 01:27.087
Whoa, bro.

01:27.188 --> 01:29.990
Then she dumped both of us
in a helicopter.

01:30.090 --> 01:33.894
Which was badass...
but mean.

01:34.862 --> 01:37.030
Now, no matter how many girls
I hook up with--

01:37.131 --> 01:40.301
- Which is a lot.
- Appreciate you, fam.

01:40.401 --> 01:41.602
I can't commit.

01:41.702 --> 01:43.737
All because of Carly.

01:43.837 --> 01:45.839
BOTH: The Ice Queen.

01:45.939 --> 01:48.041
DEEP VOICE:
Ice Queen.

01:48.142 --> 01:49.743
(doorbell ringing)

01:49.843 --> 01:53.381
I'd expect that from Beau,
but Wes?

01:53.481 --> 01:54.748
He's become such a douche,

01:54.848 --> 01:56.784
he makes Chet Hanks
look like Tom Hanks.

01:56.884 --> 02:01.121
Yeah. He works "craft beer"
into every conversation.

02:01.222 --> 02:03.891
And they're having people
mail ice to the Ice Queen.

02:03.991 --> 02:06.227
It makes no sense.
It melts.

02:06.327 --> 02:08.496
We just end up with wet boxes.

02:10.063 --> 02:12.132
Well, it's official.

02:12.233 --> 02:13.767
The Internet hates me.

02:14.968 --> 02:18.572
This is where you guys go,
"No, no."

02:18.672 --> 02:20.140
ALL: No, no.

02:20.241 --> 02:21.775
Don't tell me what to do.

02:23.411 --> 02:25.779
* I know, you see *

02:25.879 --> 02:28.282
* Somehow the world
will change for me *

02:28.382 --> 02:31.652
* And be so wonderful *

02:31.752 --> 02:35.689
* So wake up the members
of my nation *

02:35.789 --> 02:37.358
* It's your time to be *

02:37.458 --> 02:40.361
* There's no chance
unless you take one *

02:40.461 --> 02:41.995
* And the time to see *

02:42.095 --> 02:46.367
* The brighter side
of every situation *

02:46.467 --> 02:48.168
* Some things are meant to be *

02:48.269 --> 02:52.105
* So give me your best
and leave the rest to me. *

02:54.875 --> 02:57.445
Oh, you're so lucky Double Dutch
left Kevin with you

02:57.545 --> 02:58.412
while she's on tour.

02:58.512 --> 02:59.647
I scraped my knee earlier

02:59.747 --> 03:01.114
and she came over
with a slipper.

03:01.215 --> 03:03.016
It wasn't what I needed
but it was so cute.

03:04.852 --> 03:06.954
So, dog still hates you?

03:07.054 --> 03:10.123
Yes, and if Kevin hates me,
Dutch is going to hate me.

03:10.224 --> 03:12.360
This is the fourth meal
I've made her today.

03:12.460 --> 03:15.863
But this beautiful
little idiot won't eat anything

03:15.963 --> 03:16.997
I feed her.

03:17.097 --> 03:21.702
No, she won't.
No, she won't.

03:22.703 --> 03:24.738
Okay, it's all hands on deck.

03:24.838 --> 03:26.540
The Weau Bros Show's
latest video

03:26.640 --> 03:28.742
has me hemorrhaging subscribers.

03:28.842 --> 03:30.378
I need to win back
the Internet.

03:30.478 --> 03:31.545
Can't handle the pressure

03:31.645 --> 03:33.947
of being
the main character, huh?

03:34.047 --> 03:35.616
I cannot.

03:35.716 --> 03:36.984
Hit me, no bad ideas.

03:37.084 --> 03:39.019
How do I go from Ice Queen
to Nice Queen?

03:39.119 --> 03:42.323
Queen Latifah!
Is that anything?

03:42.423 --> 03:43.691
- Writing it down.
- Yeah!

03:43.791 --> 03:46.494
- Millicent, go.
- Um... pass.

03:46.594 --> 03:48.562
Writing that down too.
Harper?

03:48.662 --> 03:50.798
Everyone, meet
Dr. Pearl Wallace.

03:50.898 --> 03:53.267
She's the Kevin app's
certified animal therapist.

03:53.367 --> 03:55.669
We already met on Zoom.

03:55.769 --> 03:57.705
Hey, what's a certified
animal therapist?

03:57.805 --> 04:00.674
A pet psychic
with student loan debt.

04:00.774 --> 04:02.276
Pearl's here to help with Kevin.

04:02.376 --> 04:05.813
We can hear you two fighting
all the way down the hall.

04:05.913 --> 04:08.616
All right then, let's see
what you can do,

04:08.716 --> 04:10.784
little Miss Wild Thornberry.

04:10.884 --> 04:13.421
Her drop-dead beautiful
exterior's masking

04:13.521 --> 04:14.855
a seething inner rage.

04:14.955 --> 04:16.924
Then we should be
connecting better,

04:17.024 --> 04:19.293
'cause that's my whole deal too.

04:19.993 --> 04:23.096
You want a treat,
you majestic floof?

04:23.196 --> 04:24.798
It's not the food
you feed the dog,

04:24.898 --> 04:26.567
it's the energy
you feed the dog.

04:26.667 --> 04:30.771
I know you're helping,
but I hate you.

04:30.871 --> 04:34.141
If she meant that,
you'd be crying already.

04:34.241 --> 04:35.543
Thanks again for coming.

04:35.643 --> 04:38.546
I could never leave a dog,
or my favorite CEO,

04:38.646 --> 04:40.047
in distress.

04:40.147 --> 04:42.750
Well, you're my favorite
certified animal therapist.

04:42.850 --> 04:46.119
You're the only one I know,
but still, congrats.

04:46.219 --> 04:47.287
- Bye.
- Bye.

04:47.388 --> 04:48.456
I'll see you
at the launch party.

04:48.556 --> 04:50.991
- See you on Zoom.
- Bye.

04:51.091 --> 04:52.460
Speaking of the launch party,

04:52.560 --> 04:53.594
how's the planning
going, Spencer?

04:53.694 --> 04:56.263
Amazing.
We're going primal.

04:56.364 --> 04:58.198
I thought we could all eat
with our hands tied

04:58.298 --> 05:01.068
behind our backs
like the animals do.

05:01.168 --> 05:03.737
Spencer, I'm still trying
to rebuild my reputation

05:03.837 --> 05:04.972
after my last failed start-up,

05:05.072 --> 05:06.640
and this is my opportunity
to prove

05:06.740 --> 05:08.308
that I'm
a serious businessman.

05:08.409 --> 05:10.277
This party needs to be
the opposite of lit.

05:10.378 --> 05:13.814
So let's get...
dim?

05:13.914 --> 05:15.416
I can keep an eye
on Spencer.

05:15.516 --> 05:18.118
Good idea. Millicent is great
at serious parties.

05:18.218 --> 05:21.288
The theme of her tenth birthday
was The Magna Carta.

05:21.389 --> 05:22.690
Tenth and eleventh.

05:22.790 --> 05:24.758
Establishing the power of law
is not something

05:24.858 --> 05:26.494
that can be contained
to one afternoon

05:26.594 --> 05:28.429
at a Build-A-Bear.

05:28.529 --> 05:29.797
Great, that's settled.

05:29.897 --> 05:31.632
Now help me, please.

05:31.732 --> 05:32.966
I know I said
there are no bad ideas,

05:33.066 --> 05:36.504
but are you seeing
this whiteboard?

05:36.604 --> 05:37.838
You gotta top Queen Latifah.

05:37.938 --> 05:40.941
(scoffs) With what?!

05:42.175 --> 05:43.511
(door slams)

05:43.611 --> 05:45.946
Have you tried just
talking with them directly?

05:46.046 --> 05:49.783
Oh, you mean handle
my problems in the most direct

05:49.883 --> 05:52.352
and adult way possible?

05:52.453 --> 05:54.054
No, I have not.

05:54.154 --> 05:56.189
* *

05:58.158 --> 06:00.594
Man, this was
such a bad idea.

06:00.694 --> 06:01.995
I thought if I had
Wes and Beau on my show,

06:02.095 --> 06:04.131
I could tell
my side of the story.

06:04.231 --> 06:06.166
But look at them.

06:06.266 --> 06:08.869
They're so committed
to this bit.

06:08.969 --> 06:11.171
Can we get started?
It's hot in here.

06:11.271 --> 06:12.640
Maybe you should take
those adorable

06:12.740 --> 06:14.642
woodland creatures
off your heads.

06:14.742 --> 06:16.877
The winter gear
is because Carly...

06:16.977 --> 06:19.880
BOTH:
Is an Ice Queen.

06:19.980 --> 06:21.649
Freddie, please
just do the countdown.

06:21.749 --> 06:25.118
In five, four,

06:25.218 --> 06:27.154
three, two.

06:27.254 --> 06:31.358
Hey, friends. As promised,
I've got two very special guests

06:31.459 --> 06:35.463
for this very special
live episode of iCarly.

06:35.563 --> 06:39.199
Everybody's favorite
ex-BF's turned BFF's...

06:39.299 --> 06:44.104
- Wes and Beau.
- (both shiver)

06:44.204 --> 06:45.973
They're here to have
a good long chat

06:46.073 --> 06:49.443
about their feelings,
'cause when boys have feelings,

06:49.543 --> 06:51.278
everybody needs to know.

06:53.346 --> 06:56.950
Look, I never wanted
to hurt either of you.

06:57.050 --> 06:59.720
But you both told me
that you loved me,

06:59.820 --> 07:02.322
and I didn't
feel the same,

07:02.422 --> 07:04.658
so I thought it'd be worse
to lead you on.

07:04.758 --> 07:06.059
I really am sorry.

07:06.159 --> 07:08.896
If you really don't want
to date either of us,

07:08.996 --> 07:10.698
you must not be capable
of love at all.

07:10.798 --> 07:12.900
You're gonna be
a lonely, alone person.

07:13.000 --> 07:16.203
No hobbies, no boyfriend,
just you and your word searches.

07:16.303 --> 07:17.638
That's not true!

07:17.738 --> 07:19.907
- I will have a boyfriend.
- Yeah.

07:20.007 --> 07:22.109
Because I do have a boyfriend.

07:23.811 --> 07:27.180
I'm in a hot,
hot relationship...

07:27.280 --> 07:33.386
that is very hot,
and very relationship.

07:35.388 --> 07:37.558
Well, that wraps up
this very special episode.

07:37.658 --> 07:40.460
Wait. With who?

07:42.563 --> 07:45.499
What a rude question.

07:47.635 --> 07:49.102
Uh...

07:49.970 --> 07:53.974
- Um...
- Me!

07:54.074 --> 07:57.177
Yes. Freddie
is my boyfriend.

08:01.348 --> 08:03.150
BOTH: Whoa, bro.

08:09.122 --> 08:10.858
* *

08:13.226 --> 08:14.795
(laughs)

08:14.895 --> 08:18.065
Freddie, our first date as
a fake couple is going amazing.

08:18.165 --> 08:21.434
I can read my viewer comments
without bursting into tears.

08:21.535 --> 08:24.204
- No more death threats, baby.
- (giggles)

08:24.304 --> 08:26.740
You know, I'm actually glad
the apple orchard was closed.

08:26.840 --> 08:30.043
Digging for onions
is equally romantic.

08:30.143 --> 08:31.845
Hey, how's this for a caption?

08:31.945 --> 08:35.683
- "Our love has layers."
- Yes.

08:35.783 --> 08:40.554
Ooh, hey. Do you think Millicent
would like this onion root doll?

08:41.589 --> 08:44.658
Actually, yeah.

08:44.758 --> 08:46.159
Thanks for doing this.

08:46.259 --> 08:47.595
I know you're really busy.

08:47.695 --> 08:49.597
Hey. What are producers
slash best friends

08:49.697 --> 08:51.364
slash sort of exes for?

08:51.464 --> 08:53.266
Plus, it's good publicity
for my app.

08:53.366 --> 08:55.102
This is working out so well.

08:55.202 --> 08:57.237
And all I had to do was
what women have been doing

08:57.337 --> 08:58.772
since the dawn of time:

08:58.872 --> 09:01.742
Say I have a boyfriend
to get men to stop bothering me.

09:03.243 --> 09:05.312
(gasps) Oh, it's them.

09:05.412 --> 09:08.281
We went to three different
onion patches to find you guys.

09:08.381 --> 09:10.584
We've been waiting years
for you two to get together.

09:10.684 --> 09:12.219
We're obsessed.

09:12.319 --> 09:14.354
Emily, shut up.
Be cool.

09:14.454 --> 09:16.356
We wanna hear
exactly how it happened.

09:16.456 --> 09:19.693
Take us
on the "In-Creddie-ble" journey.

09:19.793 --> 09:21.995
- We're obsessed.
- Emily.

09:22.562 --> 09:24.197
When did you know?
Where did you know?

09:24.297 --> 09:27.567
Oh, my God,
how did you know?

09:29.002 --> 09:32.305
He pulled up to my house,
and he held a boombox

09:32.405 --> 09:35.142
over his head and--

09:35.242 --> 09:38.612
You guys don't know
who John Cusack is, do you?

09:38.712 --> 09:40.013
That's exactly what happened.

09:40.113 --> 09:42.515
ALL: Aw!

09:42.616 --> 09:45.085
- Obsessed.
- Emily.

09:45.185 --> 09:48.488
Creddie forevvie.
See, it's on my shirt.

09:49.289 --> 09:51.024
Mom. What are you doing here?

09:51.124 --> 09:52.760
She was our ride.

09:52.860 --> 09:56.063
You're not my first choice,
but I trust Fredward's judgment.

09:56.163 --> 09:57.731
Just remember,
you may sleep with him,

09:57.831 --> 10:01.101
but I'm the one
who tucks him in.

10:01.201 --> 10:02.703
Let's see you kiss.

10:02.803 --> 10:04.537
ALL: Kiss. Kiss. Kiss. Kiss.

10:04.638 --> 10:06.106
Kiss. Kiss. Kiss. Kiss.

10:06.206 --> 10:08.041
Kiss. Kiss. Come on.

10:08.141 --> 10:12.179
(laughter and screams)

10:12.279 --> 10:13.981
Ooh. Steamy.

10:14.081 --> 10:15.749
Get a room.

10:15.849 --> 10:20.087
He gets his raw animal magnetism
from my side of the family.

10:20.187 --> 10:24.257
One ticket to the family
reunion, please.

10:24.357 --> 10:26.159
I'm not gonna tell you again,
you gotta stop it.

10:26.259 --> 10:29.196
(indistinct chatter)

10:29.296 --> 10:32.599
* *

10:36.536 --> 10:38.038
You are very tense,

10:38.138 --> 10:41.374
which is ridiculous
because you live an easy life.

10:42.142 --> 10:44.644
- You are being impossible.
- No, I'm not!

10:44.745 --> 10:47.314
- Harper, this launch party--
- Shh.

10:47.414 --> 10:49.917
Dutch texted asking
for a picture of us together,

10:50.017 --> 10:52.419
so I'm trying
to get her to relax.

10:52.519 --> 10:55.723
I haven't rubbed on a bitch
this much since prom night.

10:56.123 --> 10:58.025
Got it. Would you please
tell Millicent

10:58.125 --> 11:00.060
that Freddie
put me in charge?

11:00.160 --> 11:02.629
But Freddie put me
in charge of Spencer.

11:02.730 --> 11:05.198
I am a (shudders)
year-old man.

11:05.298 --> 11:09.669
I know parties.
Two words: Human bowling ball.

11:11.138 --> 11:12.973
Whereas I'm thinking
classical music,

11:13.073 --> 11:15.342
understated florals
and soft cheeses

11:15.442 --> 11:16.543
with unpronounceable names.

11:17.310 --> 11:21.214
Spencer, Freddie is counting
on you to make this party adult.

11:21.314 --> 11:23.817
You need to listen
to the 11-year-old.

11:23.917 --> 11:27.755
Fine, but only for Freddie.
And you.

11:27.855 --> 11:30.557
And Harper,
'cause I respect her opinion.

11:30.657 --> 11:32.893
* *

11:37.998 --> 11:39.767
Be longer.

11:40.667 --> 11:44.838
Hello-- Oh, my God,
that is your entire back.

11:44.938 --> 11:47.941
Yep. Just casually 30% naked.

11:48.842 --> 11:51.044
Can you come zip me up?

11:51.144 --> 11:52.279
Yeah.

11:54.748 --> 11:56.917
This whole fake
relationship thing

11:57.017 --> 12:02.823
isn't bringing up any
real feelings for you, is it?

12:02.923 --> 12:05.258
Nah. No.

12:05.358 --> 12:07.060
Why, what about you?

12:07.160 --> 12:09.897
Did my kiss unlock
some dark, secret yearning

12:09.997 --> 12:12.732
lying dormant at the bottom
of your heart?

12:12.833 --> 12:15.402
No. Of the eight times
we've kissed,

12:15.502 --> 12:17.470
I'd rank that one... seventh.

12:18.371 --> 12:21.208
- So. Big launch party tonight.
- Yeah.

12:21.308 --> 12:24.111
You ready to act all
lovey-dovey on my livestream?

12:24.211 --> 12:26.113
I will be.

12:26.213 --> 12:28.882
Um... Actually, can you...
My mom normally...

12:28.982 --> 12:32.685
Yeah. Okay, mm, this goes

12:32.786 --> 12:36.123
through here tight,
and then here, and...

12:36.223 --> 12:40.193
Wow, I did not know
I knew how to do this.

12:40.293 --> 12:43.363
My Avril Lavigne phase
really paid off.

12:44.631 --> 12:48.001
Oh, s-sorry to interrupt.

12:48.101 --> 12:49.937
No, you're not interrupting.

12:50.037 --> 12:51.271
I think you might wanna
get to the party.

12:51.371 --> 12:55.308
- It looks a bit... somber.
- Somber?

12:55.408 --> 12:57.144
(organ music playing)

13:00.147 --> 13:01.915
Who died?

13:03.450 --> 13:05.953
Apparently you.

13:06.053 --> 13:08.521
- Then what's in the coffin?
- Bones.

13:08.621 --> 13:10.257
Ooh, bones for dogs
to chew on,

13:10.357 --> 13:12.659
but still, not great.

13:12.759 --> 13:15.195
Ah? So? Is this
serious enough for you?

13:15.295 --> 13:18.665
(scoffs) Yeah, you really
got the message across.

13:18.765 --> 13:21.268
That my app is dead on arrival.

13:21.368 --> 13:24.737
Before you judge,
have you seen the soft cheeses?

13:25.705 --> 13:27.407
It's everything you wanted.

13:27.507 --> 13:30.944
Chic dress code,
focus on you, boring as hell.

13:32.679 --> 13:34.081
Spencer, look around you.

13:34.181 --> 13:36.783
What sad event
does this remind you of?

13:41.388 --> 13:42.689
- Oh.
- Yep, yep, yep.

13:42.789 --> 13:44.925
We threw a funeral.

13:45.025 --> 13:46.393
I gotta go see
if I can salvage this.

13:46.493 --> 13:48.728
Spencer, can you please, just--
I don't know,

13:48.828 --> 13:50.330
brighten the place up a bit?

13:50.430 --> 13:52.032
I'm on it!

13:57.270 --> 14:00.240
Hi, I was told
to brighten things up.

14:02.242 --> 14:05.812
Ha, ha. Can I have
either of your phone numbers?

14:07.147 --> 14:10.984
- Wow. You guys look amazing.
- Thank you.

14:11.084 --> 14:13.420
Based on Spencer's description,
I figured we should dress

14:13.520 --> 14:16.723
for a funeral that he didn't
know he was throwing.

14:16.823 --> 14:18.858
Mm.

14:18.959 --> 14:20.127
No, no, no, it's a cake
for eating.

14:20.227 --> 14:22.562
I don't want anyone
to pop out of it.

14:22.662 --> 14:24.297
Well, let her out.

14:25.398 --> 14:26.866
Is there anything
I can do to help?

14:26.967 --> 14:28.268
I need this party to be fun.

14:28.368 --> 14:31.138
I have access
to a lot of animal drugs.

14:31.238 --> 14:34.374
Oh, I am joking about that.
I've never done weed.

14:34.474 --> 14:36.243
No one cool has.

14:38.378 --> 14:39.980
I should've planned
this party myself.

14:40.080 --> 14:41.714
I was too focused on iCarly.

14:41.814 --> 14:45.185
Of course you were. I mean,
Carly's your girlfriend, so...

14:45.285 --> 14:46.920
Oh, no, no.
Carly's not my girlfriend.

14:47.020 --> 14:49.789
That's just for the channel.
I'm single. Very single.

14:49.889 --> 14:51.124
Not in an undateable way.

14:51.224 --> 14:54.261
Just a regular... very single.

14:54.361 --> 14:56.196
Oh. Neat.

14:56.296 --> 14:58.966
I mean, whatever.

14:59.066 --> 15:02.302
But I mean neat.
I think it's neat.

15:03.403 --> 15:04.471
You do?

15:04.571 --> 15:06.906
(organ music playing)

15:07.007 --> 15:08.875
Buddy, you gotta pick up
the pace.

15:08.976 --> 15:11.578
(pace quickens)

15:11.678 --> 15:13.580
Nope.

15:13.680 --> 15:16.349
(plays "Charge")

15:17.217 --> 15:20.153
This party looks
like a home run to me!

15:21.788 --> 15:23.156
Hey, everyone,

15:23.256 --> 15:26.626
coming to you live
from my love's launch party.

15:26.726 --> 15:30.230
The Kevin app is the cutting
edge of animal therapy.

15:30.330 --> 15:31.264
It really is.

15:31.364 --> 15:32.599
I downloaded it ten minutes ago

15:32.699 --> 15:34.034
and now I don't feel bad
about my passive role

15:34.134 --> 15:35.568
in climate change.

15:35.668 --> 15:38.705
You're so strong, Tati.
You're my best friend.

15:39.539 --> 15:42.475
Look. I had my grandmother's
ring sized for Carly.

15:42.575 --> 15:44.077
Just in case.

15:44.177 --> 15:45.445
How'd you know
Carly's ring size?

15:45.545 --> 15:47.380
What? (giggles)
Are you accusing me

15:47.480 --> 15:49.316
of breaking in last night
while Carly was asleep,

15:49.416 --> 15:51.851
measuring her finger,
then singing a few bars

15:51.951 --> 15:54.421
of "Landslide" just to ensure
pleasant dreams?

15:54.521 --> 15:56.556
Harper, you are so silly.

15:56.656 --> 15:58.358
Now, where is the hubby-to-be?

15:58.458 --> 16:00.460
Let's go find him.

16:00.560 --> 16:04.998
Freddie, my little stinker,
your mom did something

16:05.098 --> 16:10.037
very sweet and expensive
and a dot illegal.

16:10.137 --> 16:11.871
Come check it out.

16:13.840 --> 16:15.008
(screams)

16:15.108 --> 16:18.245
-(all gasp)
-(plays chord loudly)

16:18.345 --> 16:20.580
I should have warned you,
that kind of sexual charisma

16:20.680 --> 16:22.849
cannot be contained.
(giggles)

16:22.949 --> 16:24.784
My little Burt Reynolds.

16:24.884 --> 16:26.586
(organ playing)

16:31.491 --> 16:33.060
* *

16:33.160 --> 16:34.761
I know what you have to do.

16:34.861 --> 16:36.263
Dump me.

16:36.363 --> 16:37.697
I'm a dirty, rotten cheater.
You gotta cut me loose.

16:37.797 --> 16:40.400
No, I can't let you take
the fall for this.

16:40.500 --> 16:41.634
This is your launch party.

16:41.734 --> 16:43.002
Don't you see?
This is the answer

16:43.103 --> 16:45.505
to your problem,
people love a woman scorned.

16:45.605 --> 16:47.040
But they don't love
a woman angry.

16:47.140 --> 16:48.475
Only men get to do that.

16:48.575 --> 16:51.911
So, do whatever you want,
but be chill about it.

16:52.845 --> 16:56.483
Okay. Thanks, Freddie.

16:56.583 --> 16:59.686
And also, I'm sorry.

16:59.786 --> 17:02.755
- For what?
- This.

17:06.159 --> 17:08.995
Who was that for?

17:09.096 --> 17:10.263
(gasps)

17:10.363 --> 17:13.233
(ringing)

17:13.333 --> 17:15.202
Dutch.

17:15.302 --> 17:17.437
Oh, it's my two girls.

17:17.537 --> 17:19.739
Yeah, the two amigas.

17:19.839 --> 17:21.908
Kevin, let's show mommy
that game we play

17:22.008 --> 17:25.412
where you pretend you can't
stand to be held by me.

17:25.512 --> 17:29.282
Oh, yeah, great job.
You doing it.

17:29.382 --> 17:31.618
We had fun.

17:31.718 --> 17:34.654
Harper, my tour got extended.

17:34.754 --> 17:41.060
Oh. Congratulations.
That's-that's such great news.

17:41.161 --> 17:42.895
I'm really happy
for you.

17:42.995 --> 17:45.398
You must be confused
because I look devastated,

17:45.498 --> 17:48.268
but I just have resting
devastated face.

17:48.368 --> 17:51.238
Come with me.
My next stop is Bavaria.

17:51.338 --> 17:53.940
They say it's the Texas
of Germany.

17:54.040 --> 17:56.976
As restrictive to my rights
as that place sounds,

17:57.076 --> 17:58.578
I can't just pick up
and leave.

17:58.678 --> 18:01.614
The thing is I'm gone
for six months.

18:01.714 --> 18:04.451
Oh. I guess we could
try long distance?

18:04.551 --> 18:06.853
Oh. No, I can't.

18:06.953 --> 18:10.257
Phone sex is
illegal in Germany.

18:11.057 --> 18:13.160
Maybe we just have
to wait until we're back

18:13.260 --> 18:14.694
in the same place.

18:14.794 --> 18:16.129
Which is what we said
we were going to do.

18:16.229 --> 18:19.266
Uh, only instead of six days
from now,

18:19.366 --> 18:20.600
it's six months
from now.

18:20.700 --> 18:22.101
Look, I...

18:22.202 --> 18:24.804
I know you're right
but this just really sucks.

18:24.904 --> 18:27.006
It does.
But you know what could

18:27.106 --> 18:29.876
really help?
Why don't you keep Kevin?

18:29.976 --> 18:31.578
No.

18:31.678 --> 18:36.149
I mean, she would
just remind me of you.

18:36.249 --> 18:38.050
That makes sense.
(sniffles)

18:38.151 --> 18:42.589
Okay, well, I'll just have
my mom pick her up, then.

18:42.689 --> 18:45.958
Goodbye, Harper.
For now.

18:46.058 --> 18:47.894
Bye.

18:51.130 --> 18:54.167
* *

18:57.103 --> 18:58.938
(sniffles)

18:59.038 --> 19:03.410
Aw. Thanks, Kev.
(sniffles)

19:03.510 --> 19:05.077
* *

19:05.178 --> 19:08.515
Wait, her mom could've
taken you this whole time?

19:08.615 --> 19:10.583
* *

19:12.252 --> 19:15.555
It's like I finally got a taste
of what real love looks like,

19:15.655 --> 19:17.624
then poof,

19:17.724 --> 19:20.593
it's touring
the Black Forest.

19:20.693 --> 19:24.431
I love Bavaria.
It reminds me of Texas.

19:24.531 --> 19:27.567
Do you think Pearl and Carly
have the same size ring finger?

19:27.667 --> 19:30.970
It looks that way,
but Carly's all knuckle.

19:33.206 --> 19:34.741
Here lies Creddie.

19:34.841 --> 19:36.643
- We had a good run.
- Mm-hmm.

19:36.743 --> 19:39.246
Until I killed it
with my lusty ways.

19:39.346 --> 19:40.847
I'm a bad, bad boyfriend.

19:40.947 --> 19:43.182
Probably because
I'm such a good CEO.

19:43.283 --> 19:46.719
And that is why I have
magnanimously and warmfully

19:46.819 --> 19:48.921
ended things with Freddie.

19:49.021 --> 19:52.725
Please respect our privacy
during this difficult time.

19:52.825 --> 19:54.594
In lieu of being mad at him,

19:54.694 --> 19:56.663
donations can be made
to the Pear store

19:56.763 --> 19:59.499
in the form of purchasing
the Kevin app.

19:59.599 --> 20:00.900
Boo!

20:01.000 --> 20:02.735
- Now, now, don't boo Freddie.
- We're not.

20:02.835 --> 20:04.804
We're booing Pearl.

20:06.539 --> 20:08.074
She's a homewrecker!

20:08.174 --> 20:10.310
(gasps)
Shut up, Emily.

20:10.410 --> 20:11.478
Preddie forevvie.

20:11.578 --> 20:13.212
Mrs. Benson!

20:13.313 --> 20:15.348
I love who Freddie loves.

20:15.448 --> 20:18.084
Carly can choke.

20:18.184 --> 20:20.119
I've known you my whole life.

20:20.219 --> 20:21.754
You taught me
how to use a tampon.

20:21.854 --> 20:24.257
Oh, I'll teach you too, dear.

20:26.759 --> 20:30.263
And hating Pearl
is an insane opinion.

20:30.363 --> 20:31.798
Insane, but popular.

20:31.898 --> 20:34.200
"Pearl makes me hurl"
is trending.

20:34.301 --> 20:37.103
Maybe they're talking
about a different Pearl.

20:37.203 --> 20:38.771
No, your last name's
Wallace, right?

20:38.871 --> 20:41.207
And you live
at 416 North Bell Creek Terrace?

20:41.308 --> 20:45.712
She got doxxed?
How did that happen?

20:45.812 --> 20:48.981
Put her driver's license back.

20:49.081 --> 20:51.918
-And stop the organ music!
-(music stops)

20:52.018 --> 20:55.288
Here.
Freddie, get this.

20:57.123 --> 21:00.092
Freddie and I
were never together.

21:00.192 --> 21:02.194
I just said that because people

21:02.295 --> 21:03.530
were demonizing me

21:03.630 --> 21:06.666
for not reciprocating
Wes and Beau's feelings.

21:06.766 --> 21:09.369
And Freddie's...

21:09.469 --> 21:10.803
Freddie's the best, so...

21:10.903 --> 21:12.639
he went along with it.

21:12.739 --> 21:16.543
And he and Pearl
would be great together.

21:16.643 --> 21:18.044
You can hate me.

21:18.144 --> 21:20.747
At least you'll be
hating me for the truth.

21:22.815 --> 21:24.651
Please don't hate me.

21:24.751 --> 21:26.686
(screams)

21:28.755 --> 21:30.757
Boom! Brightened it up.

21:31.958 --> 21:33.526
Who was that for?

21:33.626 --> 21:35.328
* *

21:37.697 --> 21:39.399
"Dang, Carly, stop lying.

21:39.499 --> 21:41.000
"We've all been cheated on.

21:41.100 --> 21:43.035
"Pathetic how you're trying
to save face by pretending

21:43.135 --> 21:45.372
the relationship
never existed."

21:45.472 --> 21:48.908
Oh. "Carly, I would never
cheat on you, queen."

21:49.008 --> 21:50.276
Then ten minutes later,
he called you a lot

21:50.377 --> 21:52.579
of mean names
for not responding.

21:52.679 --> 21:54.947
(doorbell ringing)

21:55.047 --> 21:58.250
"Freddie is a baller."
"Freddie is a boss."

21:58.351 --> 22:00.753
"Freddie, can I be
your third girlfriend?"

22:00.853 --> 22:03.222
Oh, wow, she is pretty.

22:03.322 --> 22:07.259
Gross. This-this is bad.
I hate this.

22:08.495 --> 22:11.698
Well, now they're
sending you vacuums,

22:11.798 --> 22:14.100
'cause you suck.

22:14.867 --> 22:18.605
Ooh, a Dyson.
Thank you, hater.

22:18.705 --> 22:21.073
You okay, Carly?

22:21.173 --> 22:23.943
People are gonna think
what they wanna think.

22:24.043 --> 22:26.245
And my real fans
never left me.

22:26.345 --> 22:28.881
That's who
I make content for.

22:28.981 --> 22:31.651
Them and the people
who hate watching on repeat.

22:31.751 --> 22:33.753
Still counts.

22:33.853 --> 22:35.922
Did you guys see
the new Weau Bros Show?

22:36.022 --> 22:38.925
(gasps) Spencer, you get
to shoot a reaction vid

22:39.025 --> 22:41.828
of me watching Carly watch it.

22:42.995 --> 22:44.831
I'm just saying,
I respect Carly

22:44.931 --> 22:46.232
for standing up for Pearl.

22:46.332 --> 22:49.268
Nah, bro, all women
are the same.

22:49.368 --> 22:52.371
That is a really myopic view
of gender and personality.

22:52.472 --> 22:56.643
Look, man. I don't know
what "myopic" means,

22:56.743 --> 22:58.745
but I know
I don't like it!

22:58.845 --> 23:00.847
I quit!

23:00.947 --> 23:04.283
But I just bought you all
that yogurt for the break room!

23:05.518 --> 23:07.820
ALL: Whoa, bro.

23:13.426 --> 23:15.662
* *

23:35.214 --> 23:37.116
Ooh.

23:37.216 --> 23:39.418
He hates these cans!
