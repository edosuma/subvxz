00:00.031 --> 00:02.901
Life. It's literally all we have.

00:02.936 --> 00:05.235
But is it any good? I'm a reviewer.

00:05.270 --> 00:07.872
But I don't review food, books or movies.

00:07.907 --> 00:10.775
I review life itself.

00:11.775 --> 00:13.778
Aah!

00:15.153 --> 00:17.313
Aah!

Hello! And knock, knock!

00:27.310 --> 00:29.124
Oh, cute! Who's there?

00:29.159 --> 00:31.738
Forrest MacNeil. And to
my left is A.J. Gibbs.

00:31.773 --> 00:33.469
What's my first review?

00:33.504 --> 00:36.512
"Forrest MacNeil. And
to my left is A.J. Gibbs.

00:36.547 --> 00:39.119
What is my first review?" who?

00:39.154 --> 00:40.636
What?

00:40.671 --> 00:41.934
What?

00:41.969 --> 00:43.972
I have no idea what just happened.

00:44.007 --> 00:46.306
But please, press the button.

00:46.341 --> 00:51.071
The first review comes from
Juanita in Madrid, Iowa.

00:51.106 --> 00:53.950
Hi! Juanita Morales here,
licensed electrician.

00:53.985 --> 00:55.951
Check me out on Yelp,
four and a half stars.

00:55.986 --> 00:57.058
Check her out on what?

00:57.093 --> 00:59.801
I'd like to know, what's
it like to be a co-host?

00:59.836 --> 01:01.544
Oh, interesting! Hmm.

01:01.579 --> 01:03.986
What is it like to be a co-host?

01:04.021 --> 01:05.705
Of what, I wonder?

01:05.740 --> 01:07.465
As there are a few different
ways of approaching the...

01:07.500 --> 01:09.933
- What are you doing?
- Go hit the button!

01:10.008 --> 01:12.103
- What?
- Yeah. You go back there.

01:12.138 --> 01:13.245
And you hit the button.

01:13.280 --> 01:14.679
- You're a co-host!
- Right.

01:14.753 --> 01:16.047
I could be a co-host right here!

01:16.097 --> 01:17.832
- Uh-huh.
- Oh, terrific.

01:17.867 --> 01:22.472
Uh, well, Juanita, off
I go to be a co-host!

01:22.507 --> 01:23.629
Uh-huh!

01:23.684 --> 01:25.073
- Don't have to travel very far.
- Nope!

01:25.108 --> 01:27.527
It's right over here. Okay, good.

01:27.562 --> 01:29.026
Sit right here.

01:29.081 --> 01:30.338
- Well, Forrest...
- Yes?

01:30.385 --> 01:31.677
what's my first review?

01:33.885 --> 01:35.446
I don't know.

01:35.516 --> 01:36.661
Please, press the button.

01:36.712 --> 01:38.268
Oh, yes! Right. Ah.

01:38.332 --> 01:40.714
As co-host, I will press the button.

01:40.765 --> 01:43.501
Uh, yeah! Okay, a cartoon bubble

01:43.554 --> 01:46.450
has popped up to say that we have a webcam

01:46.508 --> 01:49.972
from somebody named Mork
in Loris, South Carolina.

01:50.007 --> 01:52.487
Mork? That's an unusual name.

01:52.522 --> 01:54.213
- Hey, this is Mark.
- Ah.

01:54.255 --> 01:57.796
What's it like to slap a stranger's ass?

01:57.867 --> 01:59.426
- Well, you know, Mork...
- Thank you, Mark! And cute beanie!

01:59.461 --> 02:01.129
that request does sound a bit silly.

02:01.183 --> 02:03.628
- What are you doing?
- Well, here I go to find out

02:03.663 --> 02:05.891
what it's like to slap a stranger's ass.

02:05.960 --> 02:07.938
Oh, I see. Well, yeah.

02:08.012 --> 02:11.825
But not really. A.J.? A.J.?

02:11.860 --> 02:13.475
You're not really gonna
do... You can't do that.

02:13.532 --> 02:15.109
Can you stop for a second?
'Cause that's not a good idea.

02:15.155 --> 02:18.357
A.J.? A.J., you're not a life reviewer.

02:18.392 --> 02:20.632
So please don't go... I should do it.

02:20.697 --> 02:23.097
A.J.?

02:23.147 --> 02:24.783
A.J.

02:36.487 --> 02:38.435
This assignment had gone from frivolous

02:38.509 --> 02:40.995
to deeply concerning, as A.J. Gibbs,

02:41.058 --> 02:43.698
who is totally unqualified to do my job,

02:43.733 --> 02:46.622
headed out into the world
to review a life experience

02:46.692 --> 02:50.016
that was meant for me.

02:50.115 --> 02:51.986
But what was I supposed to do?

02:52.084 --> 02:54.227
I've never thought much
about what A.J. does

02:54.262 --> 02:56.289
or ever spoken to her about her duties,

02:56.352 --> 02:57.944
if, in fact, she has duties.

02:58.003 --> 02:59.469
I have no idea.

02:59.552 --> 03:02.303
So I explored the world
behind "Review" for clues

03:02.338 --> 03:03.904
about the co-host's life...

03:03.985 --> 03:06.757
Oh, hey! I didn't know if
you wanted A.J.'s lunch.

03:06.792 --> 03:08.700
...and sought guidance from our staff.

03:08.735 --> 03:12.705
Maybe you can help me with something.
I'm trying to figure out, uh, what to do.

03:12.740 --> 03:16.376
Can you tell me, what does A.J. usually
do when I'm out reviewing things?

03:16.440 --> 03:19.741
I think she just hangs out with friends.

03:19.863 --> 03:21.998
She has a lot of friends.

03:22.101 --> 03:25.711
Oh, okay. Thank you!

03:25.759 --> 03:28.694
As I explored her surprisingly
large dressing room,

03:28.721 --> 03:30.892
I began to learn more about A.J. Gibbs...

03:30.927 --> 03:31.984
That must be her dad.

03:32.065 --> 03:33.998
...and her freewheeling lifestyle.

03:34.074 --> 03:36.376
Hanging out at the beach and skiing, hmm.

03:36.411 --> 03:40.112
A.J.'s job clearly occupied
a small place in her life.

03:40.177 --> 03:41.411
As a reviewer of life,

03:41.486 --> 03:43.704
my role in the world is crucial.

03:43.755 --> 03:47.391
How could anyone do something
as trivial as co-hosting?

03:47.466 --> 03:50.413
Yes, I did kill that man in self-defense

03:50.448 --> 03:51.136
in order to defend
myself. It occurred to me

03:51.206 --> 03:54.000
that since A.J.'s lack of
responsibilities allowed her

03:54.035 --> 03:56.939
to take care of personal
business, I could do the same.

03:56.983 --> 04:00.904
I used my time to rehearse testimony
for my upcoming murder trial.

04:00.939 --> 04:04.014
I killed that man in order to
defend myself in self-defense.

04:04.049 --> 04:06.008
I was currently facing life in prison

04:06.043 --> 04:08.476
without the possibility
of parole as a result

04:08.511 --> 04:10.880
of last season's review
of killing a person...

04:12.362 --> 04:15.347
...in which a person was killed.

04:15.464 --> 04:17.141
I wish he hadn't tried to kill me.

04:17.196 --> 04:19.194
He might be here in
this courtroom right now.

04:19.228 --> 04:20.928
Except that we wouldn't be in the courtroom

04:20.964 --> 04:22.398
because no one would've been murdered.

04:22.494 --> 04:24.760
And I would not be...
No, don't say, "murdered."

04:24.795 --> 04:27.663
Ah, good question. Half a star.

04:27.698 --> 04:30.105
A murderer who wanted to murder somebody

04:30.169 --> 04:31.945
would probably have given the experience

04:32.013 --> 04:34.350
more than half a star,
maybe even five stars.

04:34.405 --> 04:36.272
- I give...
- Come on, Forrest, A.J.'s back.

04:36.307 --> 04:38.687
- Already?
- Yes. Got to get you changed.

04:38.722 --> 04:40.089
What do you mean, get me changed?

04:40.124 --> 04:44.049
The co-host doesn't wear the same
thing for the intro and the outro, so...

04:44.084 --> 04:45.528
A.J. changes clothes?

04:45.587 --> 04:48.288
A.J.'s surprisingly quick
completion of her assignment

04:48.386 --> 04:49.965
meant that there was precious little time

04:50.034 --> 04:54.754
to understand the experience
of being a co-host.

04:54.789 --> 04:55.875
I don't hate it.

04:55.930 --> 04:57.592
But the bow tie's slowing the momentum.

04:57.627 --> 04:59.363
- What?
- Try this.

04:59.427 --> 05:01.225
And for some reason, much of that time

05:01.276 --> 05:04.519
would be spent trying to improve
on the perfectly acceptable outfit

05:04.572 --> 05:06.706
I usually wear.

05:06.898 --> 05:08.243
- Fine, right?
- Oof.

05:08.285 --> 05:09.888
You should never wear
gray with that skin tone.

05:09.942 --> 05:11.310
It's almost as bad as tan.

05:11.376 --> 05:12.832
- Try this.
- And give me those glasses.

05:12.902 --> 05:15.334
- They're at war with your face.
- Yeah, and winning.

05:15.430 --> 05:17.899
- You're on in 2.
- Ridiculous.

05:17.982 --> 05:20.478
As with A.J., this would
be my first opportunity

05:20.513 --> 05:21.783
to see the host's work.

05:21.855 --> 05:24.152
- A.J...
- Love the suit! Tom Ford?

05:24.187 --> 05:25.993
I don't know. Do you really
change outfits for every review?

05:26.052 --> 05:27.910
- Yay, here we go.
- Here we go!

05:27.959 --> 05:31.427
I was nervous, both for her and my show.

05:31.587 --> 05:35.039
I set out to find a stranger
with an ass that I could slap.

05:35.102 --> 05:36.204
She works out.

05:36.239 --> 05:38.537
As I studied these random asses,

05:38.629 --> 05:39.457
I thought about what our
asses tell the world about us.

05:39.504 --> 05:41.316
Watching A.J.'s review on the monitor

05:41.381 --> 05:43.548
was an anxious and
uncomfortable experience.

05:43.583 --> 05:45.010
...a kind patient, understanding person.

05:45.082 --> 05:47.020
How I wished I could jump into the screen

05:47.081 --> 05:50.801
and take my rightful place,
slapping the ass of a stranger.

05:50.853 --> 05:54.290
But as co-host, my job was
to do absolutely nothing.

05:54.371 --> 05:55.457
And so I did.

05:55.542 --> 05:57.882
But would it be right
to exploit a human being

05:57.917 --> 06:00.904
in this way just to see what it feels like?

06:00.973 --> 06:04.547
Also, I thought it would be respectful
to check in with my boyfriend.

06:04.614 --> 06:07.438
How would he feel about me
slapping a stranger's ass?

06:07.493 --> 06:10.606
Does it matter if it's a man or a woman?

06:10.672 --> 06:11.853
Uh-huh.

06:11.908 --> 06:14.493
My thoughts exactly. I love you, too.

06:14.556 --> 06:17.661
Thinking about others instead
of just myself allowed me

06:17.734 --> 06:21.302
to learn something I will never forget.

06:21.372 --> 06:23.057
What... What happened?

06:23.143 --> 06:24.778
What... That's not it. Is that it?

06:24.813 --> 06:25.977
- Yeah.
- No.

06:26.022 --> 06:30.695
Slapping a stranger's ass would have
made me disrespect someone I knew,

06:30.767 --> 06:32.509
someone I didn't know, and someone

06:32.544 --> 06:36.136
I just got to know a
little bit better... me.

06:36.171 --> 06:38.993
But you didn't, uh, do
it. You didn't do it.

06:39.028 --> 06:40.418
- Right.
- The assignment is,

06:40.486 --> 06:41.886
well, you've got to slap a stranger's ass!

06:41.959 --> 06:43.263
You didn't slap a
stranger... You didn't do it!

06:43.352 --> 06:44.455
How are you gonna give it stars?

06:44.528 --> 06:47.570
Who cares how many stars slapping
a stranger's ass would get?

06:47.684 --> 06:50.754
Who cares how many stars?
That's the whole point of it!

06:50.811 --> 06:53.174
If you don't want to do
something, you can veto it, right?

06:53.209 --> 06:56.064
But you've got to do that
before you leave the studio!

06:56.161 --> 06:57.977
I guess you don't, 'cause I didn't.

06:58.044 --> 07:01.514
Slapping a stranger's
ass... I didn't do it.

07:01.619 --> 07:03.621
No. That's not a...

07:06.220 --> 07:09.793
In my time as co-host, I felt
rudderless and insignificant.

07:09.828 --> 07:11.963
But I am thankful for the experience

07:12.030 --> 07:14.967
because it reaffirmed that
my rightful place in the world

07:15.025 --> 07:18.027
is out in it issuing life reviews

07:18.062 --> 07:20.297
instead of watching
someone else botch them.

07:20.332 --> 07:22.305
- No offense.
- I'm not offended.

07:22.340 --> 07:24.613
Being a co-host gets half a star.

07:24.684 --> 07:26.852
- If you say so.
- I do.

07:31.431 --> 07:34.432
Oh, I cannot wait to get back
out there and review something!

07:34.467 --> 07:35.951
What is next, A.J.?

07:36.026 --> 07:38.152
An e-mail from Mamma Carlotta.

07:38.232 --> 07:39.183
Mamma Carlotta?

07:39.249 --> 07:41.824
"When my son complains
about his miserable life

07:41.905 --> 07:45.457
as a carnival attraction,
I tell him he's had it easy.

07:45.519 --> 07:48.723
Will you please show my boy,
Johnny, The Human Hamster,

07:48.758 --> 07:50.599
what real adversity looks like?

07:50.634 --> 07:52.706
What's it like to be Helen Keller?"

07:52.777 --> 07:53.944
- You're kidding!
- Oh!

07:54.034 --> 07:56.296
What is it like to be Helen Keller?

07:56.331 --> 07:58.406
Fascinating. What a great question.

07:58.441 --> 08:02.354
I think I know all I need to
begin this assignment right now.

08:02.404 --> 08:03.357
- Right now?
- Yes.

08:03.420 --> 08:06.401
I am going to find out
what it is like to be blind

08:06.447 --> 08:09.580
and also deaf and also mute.

08:09.630 --> 08:11.063
She couldn't speak.

08:11.169 --> 08:13.738
Off I go to be Helen Keller!

08:13.773 --> 08:17.031
- Oh! Forrest! Forrest!
- Ohh! Ow! Ah!

08:17.066 --> 08:18.705
- Are you okay?
- I can't hear you.

08:18.740 --> 08:21.238
Do you need help?

08:21.305 --> 08:23.334
You don't want help?

08:27.002 --> 08:28.871
Should've used a veto for this one.

08:29.040 --> 08:30.410
Tons of vetoes over there.

08:30.445 --> 08:31.979
As I set out on this journey,

08:32.014 --> 08:35.244
I hoped to foster a greater
understanding of disabilities

08:35.285 --> 08:36.933
by thoughtfully and sensitively

08:37.006 --> 08:40.341
exploring the experience
of being Helen Keller.

08:40.484 --> 08:42.320
For centuries, this brave woman

08:42.355 --> 08:44.656
had been the butt of tasteless jokes.

08:44.691 --> 08:46.338
That would end today.

08:46.419 --> 08:48.358
Ow!

08:48.460 --> 08:52.389
By necessity, my office staff would
need to play a key role in helping me

08:52.463 --> 08:53.996
- to live as Helen Keller.
- Doin' good.

08:54.031 --> 08:55.592
Oh, my gosh. They finally
refilled the jelly beans.

08:55.645 --> 08:58.808
- Stop it!
- Yellow.

08:58.886 --> 09:00.034
- Give me yellow.
- I like the oranges.

09:00.069 --> 09:01.705
Mr. MacNeil. Mr. MacNeil.

09:01.801 --> 09:04.996
Some of their efforts were
very much appreciated indeed,

09:05.086 --> 09:07.276
such as this soundproof, lightproof helmet

09:07.347 --> 09:10.749
contraption which allowed me
to take my hands off of my ears,

09:10.784 --> 09:12.551
just as Helen Keller would've done.

09:12.586 --> 09:14.392
- Aah!
- Aah!

09:14.446 --> 09:18.354
But they made other contributions
that were less helpful.

09:18.424 --> 09:21.567
This Victorian-era dress
and brown wig, for instance,

09:21.602 --> 09:23.579
may have made me look like Helen.

09:23.614 --> 09:25.505
But they did not make it any easier for me

09:25.540 --> 09:27.515
- to get along in the world.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

09:27.604 --> 09:30.051
And Josh and Tina's
less-than-perfect efforts

09:30.086 --> 09:33.328
to help me navigate my
surroundings made me a nuisance.

09:33.363 --> 09:34.945
- No, don't. Don't!
- What's wrong with you?

09:34.980 --> 09:36.982
- Stop. Stop. Stop.
- No.

09:37.051 --> 09:39.752
As a disabled person, I
needed the people around me

09:39.826 --> 09:42.126
to treat me with kindness and compassion.

09:42.161 --> 09:46.300
And I'm about to quit in three,

09:46.335 --> 09:47.549
two...

09:47.584 --> 09:49.470
I had faith in my office staff to do that.

09:49.505 --> 09:50.060
Okay.

09:50.120 --> 09:52.155
- Upon reviewing the footage...
- Shut the door!

09:52.190 --> 09:54.392
Helen, stay in your office!

09:54.468 --> 09:57.236
...I see how wrong I was.

09:57.271 --> 10:00.039
Even though I could not
see or hear anything,

10:00.074 --> 10:03.582
I could sense the world
losing patience with me.

10:03.695 --> 10:06.063
But still, I needed to communicate.

10:06.098 --> 10:08.892
So, did you guys want to order?

10:08.927 --> 10:10.678
Or do you need some more time?

10:10.751 --> 10:13.538
I tried everything I imagine
Helen must have tried...

10:13.573 --> 10:15.199
clapping, charades-style clues...

10:15.234 --> 10:16.938
- He has to pee.
- ...guttural moaning.

10:17.001 --> 10:18.439
Surely, one of these tools,

10:18.511 --> 10:20.676
commonly used by the
disabled, would do the trick.

10:20.711 --> 10:22.640
Sounds like...

10:22.697 --> 10:26.021
But on a day when I wanted
to be taken to see my ex-wife,

10:26.118 --> 10:28.364
I was instead robbed of my shoes.

10:28.399 --> 10:31.062
On a day when I wanted a light snack,

10:31.097 --> 10:33.025
I was instead given a pen.

10:35.563 --> 10:38.429
On a day when I wanted to
play catch with my son, Eric,

10:38.477 --> 10:42.482
like I used to, I was instead
brought to a drugs party.

10:44.394 --> 10:48.358
And finally, on a day when I wanted
to be taken for a stroll outside,

10:48.393 --> 10:50.501
I was troublingly brought to court,

10:50.536 --> 10:52.937
where I was facing trial for murder.

10:52.994 --> 10:56.396
My caretakers had failed me spectacularly.

10:56.639 --> 11:01.897
This was the worst possible
time to be deaf, dumb, and blind.

11:01.946 --> 11:03.546
Okay, right.

11:03.605 --> 11:06.259
And what is your relationship
with your ex-husband?

11:06.333 --> 11:08.800
I was unable to discuss
anything with my lawyer...

11:08.835 --> 11:10.024
He's my ex-husband.

11:10.059 --> 11:14.486
...who made the questionable decision to
call my ex-wife as a character witness.

11:14.572 --> 11:16.211
During the time of your marriage,

11:16.255 --> 11:18.356
did he bring you flowers

11:18.391 --> 11:21.164
or pay you compliments?

11:21.221 --> 11:23.455
Um, yes, he did.

11:23.521 --> 11:25.326
He did stuff like that?

11:27.441 --> 11:28.385
Yes.

11:28.420 --> 11:30.697
Oh, well he sounds like a really nice guy,

11:30.755 --> 11:31.937
doesn't he?

11:32.001 --> 11:34.000
No further questions, Your Honor!

11:34.066 --> 11:36.924
While everyone tried to ignore
the presence of a grunting visitor

11:36.982 --> 11:38.384
from the 19th century,

11:38.453 --> 11:41.871
Suzanne was asked if she thought
I would commit murder for the show.

11:43.808 --> 11:45.942
No, I don't.

11:46.136 --> 11:48.768
He is overly committed to his work,

11:48.803 --> 11:53.142
but he's not so committed that
he would actually kill somebody.

11:53.189 --> 11:55.468
Oh, my God.

11:55.565 --> 11:57.298
And then, unbeknownst to me,

11:57.333 --> 11:59.846
my lawyer made an even
more perplexing decision.

11:59.932 --> 12:02.900
The defense would like
to call Forrest MacNeil.

12:03.052 --> 12:04.055
This way, ma'am.

12:04.090 --> 12:04.856
There we go.

12:04.891 --> 12:07.573
We had always planned for
Forrest MacNeil to testify.

12:07.645 --> 12:09.989
- Down. Down!
- Down!

12:10.024 --> 12:12.350
My attorney saw no reason to change course,

12:12.385 --> 12:15.797
despite the fact that Forrest
MacNeil was now Helen Keller.

12:15.855 --> 12:18.694
Thank you for coming to
testify today, Mr. MacNeil.

12:18.729 --> 12:20.581
- I'm gonna cut right to the chase.
- There is much Forrest MacNeil

12:20.633 --> 12:22.357
could have said in his own defense.

12:22.392 --> 12:26.716
Is it true that that guy,
Ray, attacked you first?

12:26.764 --> 12:28.639
- Indeed it was true.
- Mr. MacNeil? Forrest?

12:28.728 --> 12:30.536
Ray, the man who was killed,

12:30.592 --> 12:32.259
was a violent sociopath.

12:32.294 --> 12:34.468
Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh, god. Can I get out of here?

12:34.503 --> 12:36.072
- Oh, God!
- A man who would surely have been

12:36.137 --> 12:38.216
killed somebody someday.

12:38.251 --> 12:42.024
You did this in self-defense.
Is that true, Forrest?

12:42.059 --> 12:43.863
Say, "Yes." Just say, "Yes."

12:43.913 --> 12:45.941
The answer was yes.

12:46.015 --> 12:50.219
I had no doubt Ray was beating me to death.

12:50.254 --> 12:53.265
You did this in
self-defense. Is that true?

12:53.337 --> 12:54.417
All you have to do is say, "Yes."

12:54.463 --> 12:56.229
Say, "Yes."

12:56.274 --> 12:58.964
But Helen could not answer,
even if she had known

12:59.013 --> 13:01.615
she was testifying to save my life.

13:01.682 --> 13:02.817
Okay, Forrest. Come here.

13:02.873 --> 13:06.149
If only my attorney had tried
harder to remove my helmet,

13:06.199 --> 13:08.489
or had not called me to stand at all.

13:08.524 --> 13:09.681
Oh! Oh, my God.

13:09.748 --> 13:11.747
Ma'am, sit in your seat,

13:11.782 --> 13:13.470
or I will handcuff you to this chair.

13:13.536 --> 13:17.072
Yeah. I think we got
to go back to the seats.

13:17.137 --> 13:19.765
Being in constant need of
assistance made it clear

13:19.846 --> 13:22.158
- that in life...
- Be careful.

13:22.232 --> 13:25.131
All right. That is good enough for me.

13:25.186 --> 13:26.613
...we are surrounded by people

13:26.672 --> 13:29.672
who do not fully apply
themselves to their duties.

13:29.707 --> 13:32.694
As a result, I was not
able to exonerate myself.

13:32.753 --> 13:34.253
And "Review," once again,

13:34.288 --> 13:37.190
left my fate in the hands of fate.

13:37.381 --> 13:39.929
Living as Helen Keller
was an isolating experience

13:40.002 --> 13:42.138
that required trust, perseverance,

13:42.173 --> 13:44.630
and a high tolerance for minor abrasions.

13:44.687 --> 13:49.629
She was a remarkable woman and,
for a little while, so was I.

13:49.691 --> 13:53.530
I give being Helen Keller five stars.

13:55.631 --> 13:59.005
Pretty bad luck that that had to
happen during your murder trial, huh?

13:59.040 --> 14:01.484
Oh, that? No. I was acquitted. Not guilty!

14:01.519 --> 14:03.039
- What?!
- Yes!

14:03.094 --> 14:04.070
- Really?
- Yeah.

14:04.131 --> 14:05.038
Well, why?

14:05.073 --> 14:07.843
Well, I think many of the jurors
have probably seen this show

14:07.901 --> 14:09.701
and understand the value of my work.

14:09.770 --> 14:11.571
The district attorney
had another explanation.

14:11.606 --> 14:13.639
He said, "It's almost to convict someone

14:13.674 --> 14:16.808
who looks like me for
using a gun in America."

14:16.843 --> 14:19.010
I don't know what he means.
But anyway, once again,

14:19.045 --> 14:21.545
the mighty hand of the
universe has intervened

14:21.585 --> 14:25.489
so that I may continue to do
this vitally important work.

14:29.630 --> 14:31.083
All right, A.J. Please tell me

14:31.118 --> 14:32.818
we've got time for another review!

14:32.853 --> 14:34.343
We have time for another review.

14:34.417 --> 14:35.913
- Ha-ha! Do we really?
- We do!

14:35.948 --> 14:37.747
Oh, good.

14:37.838 --> 14:39.026
This one's a tweet

14:39.097 --> 14:42.214
from Amos Stellenbosch, location unknown.

14:42.249 --> 14:46.147
- Wow!
- Amos tweets, "What is forgiveness?"

14:46.194 --> 14:48.934
Oh, that's a good, heavy one.

14:48.991 --> 14:52.633
Oh. Well, too bad this isn't the
assignment you got and then refused to do.

14:52.707 --> 14:55.172
I'm off to experience forgiveness.

14:55.214 --> 14:56.459
I would've done this one.

14:56.527 --> 14:58.761
Who knows? I will, that's for sure.

14:59.545 --> 15:00.806
My ex-wife, Suzanne,

15:00.884 --> 15:04.275
and I had had some regrettable
difficulties in recent times,

15:04.338 --> 15:07.347
many of them related to my
work for this television show.

15:07.421 --> 15:13.043
This was surely the place to have a
meaningful exploration of forgiveness.

15:13.105 --> 15:15.082
- What do you want, Forrest?
- Hello.

15:15.121 --> 15:16.657
You know what? I have a review for you.

15:16.719 --> 15:18.630
What's it like to leave
me the [bleep] alone?

15:18.665 --> 15:20.183
If you are curious

15:20.227 --> 15:23.154
about that life experience, then
I suggest you submit your request

15:23.189 --> 15:24.429
- to through the proper channels.
- Oh, my God. Good-bye, Forrest.

15:24.495 --> 15:25.965
And if your random s... Wait! Hey, Suzanne!

15:26.049 --> 15:28.042
I'm reviewing forgiveness!

15:31.600 --> 15:32.507
Okay.

15:34.246 --> 15:36.737
Did you just say you were
reviewing forgiveness?

15:36.803 --> 15:38.070
Yes. Yeah.

15:38.128 --> 15:39.393
What's the catch?

15:39.428 --> 15:40.700
There's no catch.

15:40.735 --> 15:42.344
- I don't believe you.
- No, really, honestly.

15:42.379 --> 15:45.140
That's... I'm here to review forgiveness.

15:47.965 --> 15:49.965
I can't believe I'm engaging in this,

15:50.062 --> 15:53.387
but I've actually been
talking with my therapist

15:53.460 --> 15:56.347
for some months now about forgiveness.

15:56.537 --> 15:58.087
I'd really like to try.

15:58.150 --> 16:01.221
I hate that this is just
part of a [bleep] review.

16:03.880 --> 16:05.207
All right then.

16:07.438 --> 16:08.561
Suzanne...

16:10.517 --> 16:11.784
I forgive you.

16:12.913 --> 16:14.765
- Excuse me?
- Yeah.

16:14.800 --> 16:16.867
- What did you just say?
- Ah.

16:16.975 --> 16:18.716
I forgive you for everything that you said.

16:18.760 --> 16:19.745
- For what?
- Well, for everything...

16:19.789 --> 16:22.039
- For what?
- For... For what?

16:22.137 --> 16:23.746
Yeah.

16:23.845 --> 16:25.172
I had no idea

16:25.230 --> 16:28.961
what you said about me during my murder
trial until I took off my Hel-Kel-met.

16:28.996 --> 16:30.644
- Don't. Nope.
- My Helen Keller helmet.

16:30.725 --> 16:32.305
- But when I finally heard...
- Mm-hmm.

16:32.379 --> 16:36.127
that you felt like there are all kinds
of things that I won't do for my work,

16:36.162 --> 16:37.769
and you said that like that.

16:37.804 --> 16:39.739
"Oh. He's committed, but
he's not that committed."

16:39.797 --> 16:41.058
Are you [bleep] kidding me?

16:41.105 --> 16:42.626
All right. I mean, that...

16:44.001 --> 16:46.884
hurt me so much.

16:46.970 --> 16:48.309
But I'm gonna be the bigger person.

16:48.344 --> 16:50.845
- Oh.
- And I'm just gonna say,

16:50.880 --> 16:55.016
in the face of some
very, very hurtful words,

16:55.339 --> 16:56.285
"I forgive you."

16:56.374 --> 16:57.142
- Okay.
- Yes?

16:57.202 --> 16:58.636
No, I talk now.

16:58.941 --> 17:01.430
You divorced me for your television show.

17:01.496 --> 17:02.729
I want a divorce.

17:02.764 --> 17:04.435
You are going to die alone.

17:04.470 --> 17:06.417
You were very largely responsible

17:06.496 --> 17:08.983
for killing my father in outer space.

17:09.066 --> 17:10.431
No! Jack!

17:10.465 --> 17:13.001
- In inner space.
- No! It was outer space.

17:13.036 --> 17:16.453
- No.
- You slept with me under false pretenses

17:16.532 --> 17:20.330
with a drug-resistant form of gonorrhea!

17:20.391 --> 17:24.790
You allowed Eric and me to believe
you had terminal brain cancer.

17:24.825 --> 17:26.795
And then, when I was ready to move on,

17:26.871 --> 17:30.343
you catfished me and got me hooked
up with an asshole baseball player

17:30.378 --> 17:32.491
and then humiliated me
at my rehearsal dinner.

17:32.526 --> 17:33.959
I was catfishing you, Suzanne.

17:34.017 --> 17:36.052
What? Who are you? What is going on?!

17:36.087 --> 17:38.154
You have vanished for months at a time...

17:38.221 --> 17:38.922
Ah!

17:38.988 --> 17:40.469
...without telling us where you were.

17:40.504 --> 17:43.086
We could only assume that you were dead.

17:43.136 --> 17:46.986
You showed me a photo of
your engorged, deformed penis.

17:47.046 --> 17:48.005
- Okay?
- Oh, [bleep]!

17:48.040 --> 17:49.679
I don't think that belongs on this list.

17:49.768 --> 17:51.839
Oh. And I just remembered one.

17:51.874 --> 17:53.507
You got charged with murder!

17:53.542 --> 17:57.878
Hey! I get to take a ride in a police car!

17:58.069 --> 18:01.218
Did it ever occur to you,
just once, that possibly,

18:01.253 --> 18:04.823
you should be asking me for my forgiveness?

18:04.858 --> 18:06.122
Um...

18:06.849 --> 18:09.485
well, I didn't interpret
the assignment that way.

18:09.559 --> 18:13.616
You didn't interpret
the assignment that way?

18:13.700 --> 18:15.496
- No.
- What I would like to apologize for

18:15.531 --> 18:17.297
is opening the door at all to you.

18:17.332 --> 18:19.083
- No.
- And engaging in this insanity.

18:19.149 --> 18:20.648
No, I'm very glad.
Listen, listen because...

18:20.701 --> 18:22.650
No, no! Look! Okay?

18:22.685 --> 18:23.880
You are not a person.

18:23.957 --> 18:26.420
You are a malfunctioning robot.

18:26.455 --> 18:29.424
And it's sad, Forrest, because
you used to be a person.

18:29.459 --> 18:31.840
You used to do things because
<i>you</i> wanted to do them,

18:31.875 --> 18:35.169
not because, "Oh! A stranger
said I should take my dick out

18:35.212 --> 18:37.412
and walk all over my
ex-wife's front lawn."

18:37.447 --> 18:39.410
Okay. That was not the review request.

18:39.468 --> 18:41.002
I... I was living my dream.

18:41.043 --> 18:43.600
- This is the hand of the universe.
- Oh, my God. Do you hear you?

18:43.650 --> 18:45.257
You sound like a lunatic.

18:45.330 --> 18:46.204
I don't think I sound like a lunatic.

18:46.239 --> 18:48.583
- You do, I promise you.
- There's no other explanation

18:48.618 --> 18:49.945
- for what's going on...
- Oh, my God. Forrest!

18:49.980 --> 18:51.582
...other than the universe is guiding us!

18:51.617 --> 18:53.059
- Wake up! You're crazy!
- Listen, listen, listen.

18:53.098 --> 18:54.682
I'll do it the way you want
it, because you're right.

18:54.763 --> 18:57.245
I could've interpreted the
question a different way,

18:57.305 --> 18:58.639
absolutely.

18:58.696 --> 19:00.229
Forgive me.

19:00.288 --> 19:01.957
- What?
- Do it. All the things...

19:02.039 --> 19:03.948
"Do it"? No, I will not. I cannot.

19:04.030 --> 19:05.605
I'm saying, let's do it
the way you want to do it!

19:05.673 --> 19:09.002
I won't do it! This review gets zero stars!

19:09.037 --> 19:10.444
Well, you can't give zero
stars to something, actually.

19:10.479 --> 19:12.807
Yeah, well, I give zero [bleep].

19:14.073 --> 19:15.080
Oh...

19:15.115 --> 19:17.900
Before literally slamming
the door in my face,

19:17.981 --> 19:20.414
Suzanne had raised an interesting thought.

19:20.449 --> 19:23.062
Perhaps I would not fully
understand forgiveness

19:23.097 --> 19:26.599
without both forgiving and being forgiven.

19:26.666 --> 19:29.166
Luckily, I had another idea.

19:30.388 --> 19:32.326
My search for forgiveness now led me

19:32.361 --> 19:35.010
to the bedside of my best
friend and producer, Grant...

19:35.045 --> 19:36.716
Hey, Grant. Can I have a word with you?

19:36.782 --> 19:39.172
...and some very difficult
unfinished business.

19:39.207 --> 19:40.898
Can it wait until morning?

19:40.987 --> 19:42.295
No. I don't think so.

19:42.330 --> 19:43.323
Okay.

19:43.422 --> 19:45.534
I think it's waited too long already.

19:46.640 --> 19:48.620
Do you remember when
we fell off that bridge,

19:48.655 --> 19:51.131
and you were paralyzed from the waist down?

19:52.204 --> 19:54.038
Yes.

19:54.120 --> 19:55.852
And it was all my fault?

19:56.996 --> 19:58.297
Yes.

19:58.481 --> 19:59.621
Grant...

20:01.429 --> 20:03.561
I'm asking for your forgiveness.

20:05.815 --> 20:08.551
I forgave you before we even hit the water.

20:12.643 --> 20:14.912
Ah.

20:14.947 --> 20:16.646
That is a huge relief.

20:18.750 --> 20:20.169
That feels great.

20:20.932 --> 20:22.458
I came to realize that you

20:22.541 --> 20:24.250
forgive a person who wronged you,

20:24.321 --> 20:27.103
not to free them from
the prison of your anger

20:27.190 --> 20:29.122
but to free yourself.

20:29.227 --> 20:32.374
And you seek forgiveness
also to free yourself

20:32.449 --> 20:34.783
and also the person who's forgiving you.

20:34.872 --> 20:37.807
They are also free. But
in any case, I am free.

20:37.842 --> 20:40.679
And that is worth four stars.

20:42.788 --> 20:44.297
Well, A.J., please tell me

20:44.332 --> 20:45.944
we have time for one more review.

20:45.986 --> 20:47.692
We have time for one more review.

20:47.773 --> 20:49.806
- Thank you.
- No, we don't really.

20:49.936 --> 20:50.920
- Oh, we don't?
- No.

20:51.033 --> 20:52.408
Oh. All right.

20:52.482 --> 20:53.899
- Good night.
- Good night.

Extra cheese!

20:59.452 --> 21:01.543
The real Helen Keller actually was, like,

21:01.616 --> 21:05.017
burned really badly when
she tried to answer the iron.

21:05.925 --> 21:07.777
Why would she answer? She can't hear it.

21:07.866 --> 21:09.377
- Mm-hmm.
- She can't talk into it.

21:09.474 --> 21:10.652
And who's calling her?

21:10.796 --> 21:13.021
And wouldn't she know long
before it reached her face

21:13.110 --> 21:14.604
that this is no phone?
