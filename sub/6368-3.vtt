Shh.

02:43.238 --> 02:46.631

02:57.428 --> 02:59.796
You told me you stayed
in Banshee because of me.

03:00.096 --> 03:01.831
I had to make sure you were okay.

03:04.802 --> 03:06.802
I'm not.

03:11.441 --> 03:13.275
Hey, listen.

03:20.616 --> 03:23.117
You don't seem surprised
to have a gun in your face.

03:24.787 --> 03:27.789
That's a symptom of a life
spent looking over your shoulder.

03:27.990 --> 03:30.358
Who are you?

03:30.660 --> 03:35.822
I'm Special Agent Robert Phillips,
FBI Internal Investigations.

03:40.802 --> 03:42.870
I didn't realize
the FBI had internal affairs.

03:42.904 --> 03:45.039
That's because you're not really a cop.

03:45.474 --> 03:48.776
But... we'll have plenty of time
to talk about all that later.

03:48.810 --> 03:50.878
Why don't you get dressed?

04:06.828 --> 04:09.096
There was a time

04:09.498 --> 04:12.732
when I was the one who
would watch you sleep.

04:14.835 --> 04:19.339
You were such a beautiful child

04:19.374 --> 04:22.209
with so much promise.

04:23.744 --> 04:26.079
It was never my intention
to disappoint you, Mother.

04:26.347 --> 04:30.116
<i>Oh, Kai.</i>

04:30.150 --> 04:33.352
<i>You could never disappoint me.</i>

04:34.354 --> 04:37.223
I just wish I could believe

04:37.391 --> 04:40.192
you were content.

04:43.898 --> 04:46.198
Who will love you, Kai?

04:47.200 --> 04:49.301
<i>Who will you love?</i>

04:49.336 --> 04:51.070
Mr. Proctor?

05:00.414 --> 05:03.039
I... I just wanted to
make sure you're okay.

05:06.085 --> 05:09.220
Promise me after I am gone...

05:11.558 --> 05:14.893
that you will move
Rebecca out of this house.

05:17.263 --> 05:20.398
It's not proper.
It's not healthy.

05:23.769 --> 05:25.803
Promise me.

05:31.110 --> 05:33.920
I should never have left her.

05:35.246 --> 05:38.449
<i>I should never have left her on the farm</i>

05:38.617 --> 05:43.883
- with my father.
- It's okay.

05:51.129 --> 05:53.830
<i>She needed me.
All those years, she needed...</i>

05:54.099 --> 05:59.002
She still needs you.
And you're here for her.

07:29.992 --> 07:32.526
Hi there.

07:36.064 --> 07:40.501
You know,
they say a man's home is

07:40.535 --> 07:44.086
<i>a window into his mind.</i>

07:44.906 --> 07:46.039
Yeah, I've heard that.

07:53.581 --> 07:56.316
Glock 17.

07:56.550 --> 08:01.788
- 9 mil. Really?
- Yeah.

08:02.056 --> 08:03.956
Gets the job done.

08:05.392 --> 08:07.026
You should know some things about me.

08:07.060 --> 08:09.629
My superiors demand
results, but they're not

08:09.630 --> 08:12.198
in the least concerned
how I achieve them.

08:12.566 --> 08:18.037
So if I were you, I would
exercise some... caution.

08:18.405 --> 08:22.908
- And if I were you, I'd do the same.
- Agreed.

08:23.243 --> 08:25.077
Why don't you put those on?

08:31.118 --> 08:34.318
So you're Proctor's big bad watchdog.

08:34.621 --> 08:37.025
You don't look so tough
from where I'm standing.

08:38.625 --> 08:41.092
So here's the plan.

08:41.427 --> 08:43.595
First, I'm gonna kill you.

08:43.962 --> 08:47.232
Then I'm going inside and
I'm gonna slowly gut your boss

08:47.600 --> 08:49.534
and his "Little House
on the Prairie" niece.

08:49.769 --> 08:52.170
I don't think so.

11:41.101 --> 11:42.501
<i>Nola.</i>

12:50.202 --> 12:54.487
<i>- Let me die.
- You already did.</i>

12:54.522 --> 12:58.007
<i>It's time to start living again.</i>

13:48.058 --> 13:49.825
<i>What the hell is a data skimmer?</i>

13:49.860 --> 13:51.726
Exactly what it sounds like.

13:52.062 --> 13:55.230
It scans and saves metadata
from encoded smart cards.

13:58.101 --> 14:01.193
We stealing real IDs from them

14:01.228 --> 14:04.556
so I can make fake IDs for us.

14:05.575 --> 14:07.642
That's all you had to say.
That wasn't so hard, now, was it?

14:08.094 --> 14:10.095
Lord knows it ain't ever easy.

14:11.897 --> 14:13.664
This one's yours. Now, I want you to...

14:16.635 --> 14:19.204
It works.

14:19.238 --> 14:21.405
Do your best not to fuck this up.

14:59.777 --> 15:02.044
That is the third time this week.

15:02.446 --> 15:04.180
You think they're trying
to tell me something?

15:13.356 --> 15:14.791
I need six IDs.

15:15.159 --> 15:16.959
Try not to move your lips
while you're counting.

15:25.803 --> 15:27.736
Okay, I got to grab it.

15:27.971 --> 15:30.205
<i>Mm-mmm, three more.</i>

15:32.309 --> 15:33.975
Running out of time.

15:38.315 --> 15:39.515
One more.

15:41.651 --> 15:44.687
Oh, I had some keys...
oh, there they are.

15:44.987 --> 15:47.355
<i>- One more.
- Thank you.</i>

15:47.656 --> 15:51.126
- I got it. Get your ass out.
- I got a big business meeting

15:51.493 --> 15:53.394
and I can't get nowhere
without these keys, you know?

15:53.429 --> 15:54.395
Thank you so much.

16:07.273 --> 16:08.939
What?

16:09.275 --> 16:11.743
If we were never going past the lobby,

16:12.110 --> 16:14.111
why you got me wearing this damn suit?

16:14.446 --> 16:18.106
'Cause there ain't no such
thing as sweatpants Monday.

16:19.350 --> 16:21.118
You can drive.

16:22.620 --> 16:24.054
Sh...

16:49.980 --> 16:52.231
You know, I prefer classic
rock, but something about

16:52.232 --> 16:54.483
country music that soothes
the soul, don't you think?

16:54.518 --> 16:57.120
How did you find me?

16:57.487 --> 17:00.456
You know, I have a rather
specialized job at the Bureau.

17:00.657 --> 17:03.159
I'm a fixer of sorts,

17:03.527 --> 17:05.761
<i>so I investigate dead
and missing agents.</i>

17:05.796 --> 17:10.433
<i>Of course, the missing ones almost
always turn out to be dead, too.</i>

17:10.666 --> 17:12.968
Like Jim Racine?

17:13.002 --> 17:17.373
<i>Instead I found his body outside an
old farmhouse in upstate New York.</i>

17:17.507 --> 17:21.042
- Really?
- Well, what was left of him.

17:21.345 --> 17:23.512
<i>He was burned up pretty bad.</i>

17:25.048 --> 17:30.685
- But not the slug that killed him.
- Glock 9 mil?

17:32.188 --> 17:38.193
- No. .308 rifle round.
- Isn't that interesting?

17:40.563 --> 17:43.798
Not as interesting as the inch-thick
file that he was keeping on you.

17:43.833 --> 17:46.768
You know, it turns out that the NYPD's

17:47.069 --> 17:48.670
<i>John Doe Capital Diamond thief</i>

17:48.904 --> 17:54.390
turned out to be the new sheriff
of Banshee, Pennsylvania?

17:55.043 --> 18:00.348
- That's quite a leap.
- Maybe, but the story gets better.

18:00.382 --> 18:04.618
Especially the part about the church,
the gunfight.

18:04.920 --> 18:06.687
I mean, it takes some king-sized balls

18:07.055 --> 18:09.190
to take on a guy like
Rabbit in a way like that.

18:09.591 --> 18:12.793
<i>And when I think about an
ex-con posing as a sheriff,</i>

18:13.228 --> 18:18.135
well, I think maybe those
are the same big balls.

18:19.734 --> 18:23.816
Well, I'm flattered,
but you're wasting your time.

18:27.141 --> 18:29.910
You know something about
wasted time, don't you?

18:30.412 --> 18:34.381
<i>I don't get it. I mean, you could
have gone anywhere when you got out.</i>

18:34.415 --> 18:37.617
<i>You could have found a black
sand beach somewhere in paradise,</i>

18:37.651 --> 18:40.453
a new golden brown señorita
every night of the week.

18:40.754 --> 18:42.522
<i>My God, that's what I would have done.</i>

18:42.790 --> 18:45.525
Oh, not you. No.
You came to Banshee.

18:45.927 --> 18:47.093
<i>You played dress-up right down the road</i>

18:47.428 --> 18:51.096
<i>from the woman who stole
15 years of your life.</i>

18:51.131 --> 18:54.133
She must be something.

18:55.803 --> 18:59.566
<i>Or else there's something inside of you
that still wants to be punished.</i>

19:01.475 --> 19:06.578
- What do you think?
- I think you talk too much.

19:08.581 --> 19:11.283
That's what my third ex-wife told me.

19:18.624 --> 19:21.460
- Okay, get out.
- You're letting me go?

19:21.794 --> 19:24.162
No, I'm letting you take a piss.

19:24.464 --> 19:26.731
It's a long way back to the city.
We're not gonna stop another time.

19:26.766 --> 19:29.501
- I'm good.
- I'm not asking. Move.

19:29.836 --> 19:31.870
- And if you try anything...
- Yeah, you'll shoot me.

19:32.137 --> 19:33.505
- I get it.
- Yeah. Come on.

19:43.482 --> 19:45.816
Hey, you know what?

19:46.185 --> 19:48.219
- I think I changed my mind.
- How's that?

19:48.253 --> 19:49.820
Well, I don't think I want
to go back to New York.

19:51.991 --> 19:53.324
You make it sound
like you have a choice.

19:53.359 --> 19:56.226
Well... there's always a choice.

20:20.551 --> 20:22.119
<i>I want to report a robbery in progress</i>

20:22.387 --> 20:26.256
<i>at the Capital Diamond warehouse.
211 Saw Mill River Road.</i>

20:28.526 --> 20:30.226
<i>I'm Detective Julias Bonner.</i>

20:30.561 --> 20:32.562
<i>It was my team that
took you down tonight.</i>

20:32.730 --> 20:35.798
<i>- Congratulations.
- You are smart enough to know</i>

20:35.833 --> 20:38.724
<i>that whoever you're
working for set you up.</i>

21:19.675 --> 21:21.275
May I?

22:41.154 --> 22:43.321
<i>May I offer you something
to drink while you wait?</i>

22:46.725 --> 22:50.228
<i>Coffee? Tea?</i>

22:50.263 --> 22:52.664
Something stronger?

23:18.723 --> 23:20.924
<i>The way I see
it, you know you got jail</i>

23:20.958 --> 23:22.726
<i>on the other side of this conversation.</i>

23:23.061 --> 23:26.530
<i>You aren't going home for many years.</i>

23:36.873 --> 23:40.543
Time to wake up, asshole.
Hey!

23:42.580 --> 23:44.280
There he is.

24:03.899 --> 24:07.102
Sorry to keep you waiting.

24:07.403 --> 24:12.207
Hopefully my associates
have made you feel at home.

24:12.575 --> 24:16.044
As you can see, comfort is a priority

24:16.279 --> 24:19.313
for a man of my dimensions.

24:19.615 --> 24:24.352
<i>Some travel is unavoidable,
but cars, vans, planes,</i>

24:24.620 --> 24:26.587
they all present indignities for me.

24:26.956 --> 24:30.591
Well, you could try eating
a salad now and then.

24:32.261 --> 24:37.865
- I think fat jokes are beneath us both.
- Well, that's hard to say

24:38.267 --> 24:40.801
seeing as I have no idea
who the fuck you are.

24:51.880 --> 24:57.091
My name
is Raymond Walton Brantley.

24:59.353 --> 25:01.655
Brantley, that's the guy you
stole the money off, right?

25:01.689 --> 25:03.657
Look, I saw some shit
I wasn't supposed to see.

25:03.992 --> 25:05.625
Brantley...
Brantley is a paranoid fuck.

25:05.794 --> 25:09.829
Yes?
No?

25:09.963 --> 25:11.331
Maybe?

25:12.800 --> 25:15.201
<i>The only thing I know for sure about you</i>

25:15.469 --> 25:18.037
is who you are not.

25:18.306 --> 25:21.508
And you are not Lucas Hood.

25:23.344 --> 25:25.477
Isn't that right?

25:27.480 --> 25:31.250
It's okay.
Despite a particularly nasty beating,

25:31.651 --> 25:35.288
<i>Agent Phillips here
of the FBI's rat squad</i>

25:35.322 --> 25:39.525
remained as quiet as a mouse.

25:41.861 --> 25:44.229
Where is Jason Hood?

25:45.332 --> 25:48.567
- I have no idea who that is.
- Really?

25:48.601 --> 25:52.204
Yes.
No.

25:52.372 --> 25:53.539
Maybe.

25:55.041 --> 25:59.444
I... just... he's dead.

25:59.678 --> 26:02.848
He's dead. He's de...

26:08.387 --> 26:10.956
Give me Jason Hood

26:11.190 --> 26:16.160
and Agent Phillips
will never cause you discomfort again.

26:16.362 --> 26:18.195
To tell you the truth,

26:18.230 --> 26:20.565
I've never really been
worried about Agent Phillips.

26:20.866 --> 26:22.233
<i>So if you can find your dick in there,</i>

26:22.534 --> 26:24.369
why don't you go fuck yourself?

26:27.072 --> 26:31.942
If I were you, I'd take a moment
to consider how tenuous

26:32.210 --> 26:35.379
your bargaining position truly is.

26:40.252 --> 26:43.286
<i>Maybe you got a girl...</i>

26:44.890 --> 26:49.292
<i>alone in the dark waiting
and wondering what happened.</i>

27:22.926 --> 27:25.327
<i>I told you I should
have handled Proctor's house.</i>

27:25.595 --> 27:28.864
- You'll get your chance soon enough.
- That's what you keep saying.

27:28.899 --> 27:31.500
<i>Let me hit him where it hurts.</i>

27:31.802 --> 27:36.662
- Show Proctor that we're in control.
- You're not ready.

27:37.640 --> 27:39.308
<i>Don't make me tell you again.</i>

27:41.978 --> 27:43.778
Chayton.

27:48.151 --> 27:49.784
You guys take a walk.

27:52.188 --> 27:53.955
Hey, Tommy.

27:57.793 --> 28:00.462
I haven't been out this
way since high school.

28:00.796 --> 28:02.363
You should not have come here.

28:06.301 --> 28:09.671
Why'd you steal those guns, Chayton?
If I didn't know any better,

28:09.972 --> 28:11.939
I'd say you were training an army.

28:11.974 --> 28:15.976
- But that would be crazy, right?
- Crazy.

28:17.512 --> 28:20.246
Crazy is allowing the reservation

28:20.648 --> 28:22.483
to become as corrupt
as the outside world.

28:22.851 --> 28:24.651
- How many...
- But that's just what Longshadow

28:24.986 --> 28:26.620
and George Hunter have done.

28:26.988 --> 28:29.689
They call us outlaws, gangbangers.

28:29.991 --> 28:31.657
Treat us like we're the problem.

28:32.026 --> 28:34.060
Because you treat violence
like it's the solution.

28:34.495 --> 28:36.896
I will do anything to protect
our land from men like Proctor.

28:36.930 --> 28:38.564
All you're doing is
hurting more of our own.

28:38.832 --> 28:40.967
This is bigger than any one person.

28:41.002 --> 28:45.305
Tell that to the dead Redbone
they pulled out of Proctor's pool.

28:45.339 --> 28:49.174
- Or the other one in the ICU.
- Casualties of a righteous war.

28:55.549 --> 28:57.650
You know, when we were kids

28:57.684 --> 28:59.685
and you and Tommy
came to live with us...

29:01.555 --> 29:03.355
<i>you were so shy.</i>

29:05.191 --> 29:06.691
<i>So gentle.</i>

29:09.529 --> 29:11.397
I told everybody you
were my real brother

29:11.697 --> 29:14.033
because I wanted it to be true.

29:17.070 --> 29:18.870
Now I barely recognize you.

29:42.061 --> 29:45.930
You sure can take a hell of a beating.
I'll give you that.

29:50.402 --> 29:51.869
Why don't you just tell him the truth?

29:52.236 --> 29:54.772
- He knows you're lying.
- He doesn't know shit.

29:55.073 --> 29:57.274
- He thinks I'm lying.
- What's the difference?

29:57.742 --> 30:00.477
Come on, Agent Phillips,
that's basic psy-ops protocol.

30:00.511 --> 30:03.647
The only way to overcome
a physical advantage

30:04.082 --> 30:05.382
- is to establish a psychological one.
- A psychological one.

30:05.617 --> 30:06.684
There you go. You remember.

30:07.085 --> 30:08.785
Yeah, I slept through
that class at Quantico.

30:08.819 --> 30:10.620
No, you didn't.

30:14.459 --> 30:15.925
You know, you can play all
the mind games you want,

30:16.260 --> 30:19.904
but we're not leaving here alive.
You know that, right?

30:19.930 --> 30:21.664
Way I see it, I'm better off in here

30:21.932 --> 30:23.400
than I was in the back of your car.

30:23.767 --> 30:25.101
Well, if that's really true,
you have to ask yourself

30:25.435 --> 30:27.369
just how fucked up
your universe really is.

30:27.404 --> 30:32.174
- The thought has crossed my mind.
- You know, I have cracked

30:32.209 --> 30:34.611
some pretty twisted minds
in my time, but you...

30:34.945 --> 30:37.013
You're not gonna give up on me, are you?

30:37.047 --> 30:40.216
Uh-uh.
Not a chance.

30:51.628 --> 30:54.563
<i> Where were we?</i>

30:54.831 --> 30:57.199
You just asked me about Jason Hood.

30:57.501 --> 31:01.924
- And you told me to go fuck myself.
- We're all caught up.

31:35.503 --> 31:37.038
I'm gonna fucking kill you.

32:07.401 --> 32:10.636
Hey, Emily, it's me. Just checking in.

32:10.871 --> 32:14.540
Um...
anyway, call me back, all right?

32:16.210 --> 32:18.712
- Is everything okay?
- Couldn't be better.

32:18.746 --> 32:21.146
I'm... I'm clocking out.

32:21.381 --> 32:24.917
- Any word from Hood?
- Nope. Nothing.

32:28.054 --> 32:30.122
I'm thinking we should turn
his office into a game room.

32:30.390 --> 32:33.693
- What do you think?
- I'm actually pretty worried.

32:33.727 --> 32:38.630
- I've been trying to reach him all day.
- Really?

32:38.664 --> 32:40.766
Well, your paperwork's
not going anywhere.

32:41.234 --> 32:42.868
Why don't you head over to
his place and see what's what?

32:43.103 --> 32:44.603
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

32:44.738 --> 32:48.406
- Okay. Thanks, Brock.
- Sure.

32:48.742 --> 32:50.181
Let me know when you'll find him.

32:50.216 --> 32:51.309
- All right.
- All right.

32:51.577 --> 32:53.311
- You heading out?
- Yep.

32:53.579 --> 32:55.046
Anywhere good?

32:55.414 --> 32:59.217
No, just having an afternoon
drink with an old friend.

32:59.252 --> 33:01.586
<i>Platinumm, what the hell was I thinking?</i>

33:03.789 --> 33:05.156
Sorry.

33:06.626 --> 33:08.960
You know, there is worse things
than getting some

33:08.961 --> 33:11.863
- from your hot ex-wife.
- No, I know.

33:12.297 --> 33:14.298
There's always a flip side
with her. You don't know Emily.

33:14.332 --> 33:17.668
I know there's nobody forcing
you to bump uglies with her.

33:17.970 --> 33:20.238
That is true. That is very true.

33:20.605 --> 33:23.707
But, you know, it's... it's complicated.

33:24.109 --> 33:26.543
Ugh, how come every time
a guy goes sticking his dick

33:26.944 --> 33:28.812
someplace he shouldn't,
it's complicated?

33:29.113 --> 33:31.582
- Well, I just...
- No.

33:31.616 --> 33:35.819
- You know, sometimes when I...
- Your ex knows exactly what she's doing.

33:36.154 --> 33:38.455
She's got you exactly
where she wants you.

33:38.823 --> 33:42.225
Losing your fucking mind
over some bomb-ass pussy.

33:42.494 --> 33:44.360
I know. I know. I know.

33:44.628 --> 33:48.364
You already know what to do,
but you're not gonna do it.

33:50.134 --> 33:52.368
You're a wise woman, Platinumm...

34:19.495 --> 34:21.797
Hey, shithead!

34:22.165 --> 34:24.498
You kill him, you'll
never get what you want.

34:26.369 --> 34:28.204
Agent Phillips is right.

34:33.042 --> 34:36.077
Are you gonna tell me where he is?

34:48.391 --> 34:50.225
Give him some fresh air!

35:20.054 --> 35:21.555
<i>Afternoon, Deputy.</i>

35:21.757 --> 35:23.023
Can I get you something?

35:23.391 --> 35:25.625
No, thanks.
Have you seen the sheriff?

35:25.894 --> 35:28.728
- He missed his shift today.
- No. No, I haven't.

35:28.763 --> 35:31.298
But he'll turn up. He always does.

35:33.935 --> 35:35.769
You know him pretty well, huh?

35:36.070 --> 35:39.372
I could say the same about you.

35:39.607 --> 35:41.441
- Could you?
- Mm.

35:41.475 --> 35:43.109
I'm not so sure.

35:45.413 --> 35:47.547
<i>Some people, you can know them</i>

35:47.581 --> 35:50.450
before you know about them.

35:52.019 --> 35:53.686
Maybe.

35:53.721 --> 35:56.122
Or maybe that'd sound a lot more
profound if I had had a few beers.

35:56.423 --> 35:58.424
Yeah, I don't doubt that.

36:00.794 --> 36:03.296
<i>All right, well,
if you hear from him...</i>

36:03.430 --> 36:04.763
Will do.

36:11.471 --> 36:13.806
<i>Now or never, mystery man.</i>

36:14.106 --> 36:15.941
- Where is Jason Hood?
- He's dead!

36:15.975 --> 36:17.810
He's fucking dead. I told you.

36:18.110 --> 36:19.611
And why should I believe you?

36:19.946 --> 36:22.113
'Cause I killed him, all right?

36:24.116 --> 36:25.884
30 seconds.

36:25.919 --> 36:28.253
I doubt a word, you become roadkill.

36:30.122 --> 36:31.856
The kid offered me 50 grand

36:32.291 --> 36:34.826
to take out your man in
the fancy suit, all right?

36:35.127 --> 36:40.698
- 25 up front, 25 when it was done.
- You killed Quentin?

36:40.967 --> 36:42.334
Well, it took some doing...

36:44.736 --> 36:47.905
- but, yeah.
- Go on.

36:48.173 --> 36:50.808
So after I killed Quentin,

36:51.142 --> 36:53.410
Jason, he didn't want to pay up

36:53.445 --> 36:55.813
and he threatened to expose me.

36:56.147 --> 37:00.651
- So you killed him and took the money?
- Fair is fair.

37:05.357 --> 37:08.859
- Where is my money now?
- It's back in Banshee.

37:09.160 --> 37:11.061
- All of it?
- Yes.

37:15.533 --> 37:18.167
And exactly how much is all of it?

37:20.671 --> 37:22.639
<i>Brantley, he likes to deal
with this sort of thing</i>

37:22.840 --> 37:24.273
<i>up close and personal.</i>

37:24.509 --> 37:26.843
62,000.

37:29.079 --> 37:30.892
<i>I will take you back home.</i>

37:31.048 --> 37:32.916
<i>You will show me Jason Hood's body.</i>

37:33.183 --> 37:34.917
You will return my money.

37:35.185 --> 37:39.088
What's going to stop you from
shooting me the moment I do?

37:39.356 --> 37:42.025
You're not on the list.

37:48.532 --> 37:50.299
Mmm.

37:50.700 --> 37:53.402
Seems I will be taking a
trip South of the border

37:53.436 --> 37:55.538
after I retrieve my money.

37:55.572 --> 38:00.769
Sadly, Agent Phillips,
your home is not on the itinerary.

38:00.977 --> 38:04.379
Wanda, tell Mr. Cole
up front to pull over.

38:04.414 --> 38:09.184
My associates will escort you
to your next destination.

38:09.419 --> 38:13.877
- Where the hell is that?
- Safe travels, Agent Phillips.

38:15.924 --> 38:17.425
Let's go.

38:52.460 --> 38:56.929
<i>Wanda, tell Mr. Cole
to take us back to Banshee.</i>

38:56.964 --> 38:58.764
<i>The boys will catch up later.</i>

38:58.799 --> 39:03.703
<i>And mix me a drink.
Bulleit Old Fashioned, extra sugar.</i>

39:03.971 --> 39:05.605
Right away, Mr. Brantley.

39:18.284 --> 39:20.152
<i>You're going back into a cell.</i>

39:20.453 --> 39:21.686
<i>You're facing eight to 10 years.</i>

39:21.954 --> 39:25.190
<i>Life as you know it is over.</i>

39:42.508 --> 39:43.708
Hey!

39:53.985 --> 39:55.319
<i>Get out of the way!</i>

40:00.492 --> 40:02.293
Stay down.

40:09.534 --> 40:11.468
- Get back!
- Down.

40:11.836 --> 40:13.737
Check the back rooms.
Make sure everyone's out.

40:14.005 --> 40:15.272
Raven, hey, it's Brock.

40:15.674 --> 40:17.875
Look, I've got a 211 in
progress at the Savoy.

40:18.176 --> 40:19.609
<i>Looks like five assailants</i>

40:20.011 --> 40:22.680
and possibly two dozen
civilians trapped inside. Hurry.

40:52.375 --> 40:54.410
Get up.

40:58.881 --> 41:00.282
Fuck.

41:10.893 --> 41:12.794
True gundog, Quentin.

41:14.030 --> 41:17.065
He could flush out the best of them.

41:17.399 --> 41:22.604
- Tell me, how'd you beat him?
- No, I'm not telling you anything.

41:22.939 --> 41:26.307
Not until you tell
me why you came so far

41:26.575 --> 41:28.276
<i>for an asshole like Jason Hood.</i>

41:28.611 --> 41:31.113
I mean, a guy like you
doesn't come all the way

41:31.413 --> 41:33.448
across the country for 60 grand.

41:33.915 --> 41:37.584
A guy like me would come
across the country for 50 cents.

42:11.619 --> 42:12.819
Start digging.

42:17.124 --> 42:19.159
My body has failed me.

42:19.460 --> 42:21.261
I failed it. Either way.

42:21.662 --> 42:24.463
<i>Things that you take
for granted, I can't do.</i>

42:24.799 --> 42:28.968
Simple trip to buy groceries
or have a meal at a restaurant.

42:29.170 --> 42:31.504
I can't even fuck anymore.

42:31.806 --> 42:36.398
But one thing I do have
is my ledger.

42:36.476 --> 42:41.213
<i>I keep my own books
and I keep everything balanced.</i>

42:41.481 --> 42:44.350
Not a decimal point out of place.

42:45.652 --> 42:48.654
The devil is in the details.

42:49.989 --> 42:55.593
And the details
are all that a guy like me has.

42:55.862 --> 42:57.830
In that case, I bet you'd love to know

42:58.164 --> 43:00.565
what Jason Hood's last words were.

43:10.043 --> 43:12.544
Tell me what he said.

43:19.184 --> 43:20.518
He said to tell you...

43:22.054 --> 43:24.589
he'll see your fat
ass real fucking soon.

43:38.370 --> 43:40.137
Up here now. You, outta
here! Get outta here!

43:40.405 --> 43:41.305
Move!

43:41.539 --> 43:42.539
Down now!

44:20.243 --> 44:21.744
Stay here.

44:24.114 --> 44:28.584
What are you doing?
No!

45:04.987 --> 45:06.354
You have it.

45:18.800 --> 45:20.468
Mr. Cole.

45:20.502 --> 45:23.370
- Wanda, where are the shotgun shells?
- Cabinet, bottom right.

45:27.809 --> 45:29.777
- Look away. Don't look at me.
- No.

45:29.811 --> 45:32.646
Everyone listen up. Listen up.

45:34.516 --> 45:36.216
We're not here to kill you.

45:36.250 --> 45:38.686
But when I'm done here...

45:39.020 --> 45:41.355
...you're all gonna
have to find new jobs.

45:41.655 --> 45:43.323
<i>Drop your weapons!
Hands in the air!</i>

45:43.358 --> 45:46.126
Don't!
Don't you fucking do it.

45:46.327 --> 45:48.962
<i>Nobody move.</i>

45:49.330 --> 45:52.132
I said to drop your weapons, fellas.

45:54.035 --> 45:56.435
Son, that knife gets
any closer to her neck,

45:56.470 --> 45:59.005
I'm gonna blow your fuckin' head off.

46:38.144 --> 46:40.045
Wanda.

47:34.065 --> 47:35.899
Sheriff's Department!

47:35.933 --> 47:37.400
Put down your guns right now.

48:18.507 --> 48:21.475
Tommy! Tommy, it's Billy Raven.

48:21.810 --> 48:25.279
You and your boys need to surrender now
and no one else gets hurt.

48:25.514 --> 48:27.548
No one except for you, cop.

48:37.359 --> 48:40.194
Damn it, Tommy!
You need to listen to me.

48:42.430 --> 48:43.730
No!

48:58.546 --> 49:01.481
Alma, we need EMTs at the Savoy now.

49:01.515 --> 49:03.516
I'll clear the back rooms.

49:03.850 --> 49:05.351
- Stay still.
- Fuck you!

49:05.686 --> 49:08.054
No, thanks. Don't fucking move.

49:08.355 --> 49:10.856
- Raven, you okay over there?
- Yeah.

49:13.860 --> 49:15.861
Knife!

49:55.601 --> 49:57.468
Where the fuck is Hood?

50:37.809 --> 50:39.643
That's deep enough.

50:45.849 --> 50:47.850
Turn around.

50:54.958 --> 50:56.859
You don't want to do this.

51:02.565 --> 51:05.534
Killing a federal agent
will get you the needle.

51:07.337 --> 51:08.470
Good-bye.

51:48.044 --> 51:51.746
- I didn't kill Racine.
- I know.

51:52.815 --> 51:54.849
So what the fuck are you doing here?

51:55.016 --> 52:00.204
I was curious.
I was tasked to find a missing agent.

52:01.357 --> 52:03.090
You're not part of that story.

52:03.392 --> 52:05.860
The Bureau doesn't
know anything about you.

52:07.695 --> 52:10.898
So what's stopping me from
leaving you in this hole?

52:18.539 --> 52:20.807
You're doing a pretty shitty
job of saving yourself.

52:20.842 --> 52:24.177
Seems we both need to work on that.

52:24.379 --> 52:26.212
Agreed.

52:59.746 --> 53:00.946
So we're good?

53:05.118 --> 53:06.786
Yeah.

53:07.921 --> 53:09.622
We're good.

53:14.961 --> 53:16.761
But you should know...

53:19.132 --> 53:20.899
I had to do something to cover my ass

53:21.267 --> 53:25.603
when I thought you would turn
out to be who you weren't.

53:30.776 --> 53:32.514

53:46.891 --> 53:49.310

55:35.978 --> 55:39.513
<i>on some of the most advanced
security systems on the market</i>

55:39.815 --> 55:42.557
<i>while rappelling from the roof,
so by my count, </i>

55:42.592 --> 55:46.119
<i>that adds up to three guys
not counting Mr. Rabbit.</i>

55:46.227 --> 55:49.056
<i>What, do you think I work
for some criminal mastermind</i>

55:49.090 --> 55:50.691
<i>that goes around calling
himself Mr. Rabbit?</i>

55:50.959 --> 55:54.462
<i>Yes, I do. Yes, I do!
Give me Rabbit!</i>

55:54.796 --> 55:56.763
<i>Give him to me
and I'll cut you a deal.</i>

55:57.165 --> 56:00.000
<i>Maybe you get 18 months.
You'll be out after a year.</i>

56:00.335 --> 56:04.004
<i>I would offer you witness protection,
but you don't have an identity,</i>

56:04.305 --> 56:07.640
<i>so my guess is that you
won't need a new one.</i>

56:07.675 --> 56:10.028
Who the hell are you?

56:19.370 --> 56:22.071
<i>you know you got jail on the
other side of this conversation.</i>

56:22.105 --> 56:24.040
<i>I used your prints to pull your file.</i>

56:24.508 --> 56:26.008
<i>There isn't one. We don't
even know what to call you.</i>

56:26.377 --> 56:29.846

Life as you know it is over.</i>

56:30.180 --> 56:33.582
<i>You aren't going home for many years.</i>

56:34.017 --> 56:36.986
<i>You're going back into a cell

56:37.354 --> 56:40.089

Rabbit written all over it.</i>

56:43.360 --> 56:45.661

56:51.534 --> 56:54.102
<i>Okay.</i>

56:54.537 --> 56:56.538
<i>This is for the record.
State your name.</i>

<i>John Smith.</i>

56:58.541 --> 57:00.709
<i>What are you doing?
Are you fucking with me?</i>

57:01.043 --> 57:02.143

57:02.544 --> 57:05.113
<i>The deal is real.
You said you wanted</i>

57:05.414 --> 57:07.548
<i>to take the deal,
you stupid motherfucker.</i>

57:07.583 --> 57:09.251
<i>Maybe, but I'm not gonna sit here</i>

57:09.551 --> 57:11.419
<i>and do your fuckin' job for you.</i>
