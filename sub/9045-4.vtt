00:00.083 --> 00:02.016
Previously on <i>Awkward...</i>

00:02.017 --> 00:03.484
Matty invited me to a party.

00:03.485 --> 00:04.485
He's taking you public,

00:04.487 --> 00:05.753
outing you as a couple.

00:05.755 --> 00:07.455
Are you and Matty together?

00:09.024 --> 00:13.962
Who the fuck invited you?

00:13.964 --> 00:16.197
Looks like Matty invited
a lot of people.

00:16.199 --> 00:18.366
You look like you're having
about as much fun as I am.

00:18.368 --> 00:19.968
It's my anniversary.

00:21.437 --> 00:22.971
Mm...Mm...

00:22.973 --> 00:24.005
You have to be home right away?

00:24.007 --> 00:25.473
I have a few hours to kill.

00:26.575 --> 00:28.042
It was homecoming week.

00:28.044 --> 00:30.478
And, like an uncomfortably
misguided tampon,

00:30.480 --> 00:32.313
it was impossible to ignore.

00:32.314 --> 00:34.048
Especially the day
of the bonfire,

00:34.050 --> 00:36.384
when the entire student body
was running around

00:36.386 --> 00:38.753
like they were high
off huffed paint...

00:38.755 --> 00:40.889
And every inch of the school
was covered in signs.

00:40.891 --> 00:43.057
[Crowd cheering]

00:43.059 --> 00:44.325
Though, to be fair,

00:44.327 --> 00:46.995
some inches needed
more coverage than others.

00:46.997 --> 00:49.330
Me, I was just
desperate for a sign

00:49.332 --> 00:50.832
that Matty was still into me.

00:50.834 --> 00:53.368
All: Hoo! Hoo!
Titans!

00:53.370 --> 00:54.369
[Paper ripping]

00:54.371 --> 00:55.370
- Go, Titans!
- Oh, yeah!

00:55.372 --> 00:58.106
Oh, my God, they have boners!

00:58.108 --> 01:00.608
Do all boners
look like weapons?

01:00.610 --> 01:02.610
Have you never seen
a marshmallow shooter?

01:02.612 --> 01:03.945
Like you guys have.

01:03.947 --> 01:06.281
Um, yeah, I'm in the band.

01:06.283 --> 01:07.715
And Jenna saw peen
when mckibbers

01:07.717 --> 01:08.783
gave her the hymen hammer.

01:08.785 --> 01:10.118
You had sex with Matty?

01:10.120 --> 01:11.319
Why did you tell Tamara
and not me?

01:11.321 --> 01:12.954
I was gonna tell you, but...

01:12.956 --> 01:14.355
Matty's still kissing
other girls.

01:14.357 --> 01:17.058
He hooked up with Michelle
in Lissa's hot tub.

01:17.060 --> 01:18.126
- What?
- Look!

01:18.128 --> 01:20.461
Betsy Motamedi has pink eye.

01:20.463 --> 01:21.629
Ow. Heh.

01:21.631 --> 01:24.032
So...You're in
an open relationship?

01:24.034 --> 01:25.400
Well, technically,
it's not anything.

01:25.402 --> 01:26.701
They haven't D.T.R.

01:26.703 --> 01:29.837
True, we hadn't
"defined the relationship."

01:29.839 --> 01:32.507
But I wasn't sure there was
a relationship to define.

01:32.509 --> 01:34.442
And I didn't want
to discuss it with Ming,

01:34.444 --> 01:35.777
who was getting
all judge Judy on me.

01:35.779 --> 01:37.745
J, I've known you
since third grade,

01:37.747 --> 01:39.614
and there's no way
you're cool doing it with a guy

01:39.616 --> 01:41.516
who's kissing other girls.

01:41.518 --> 01:44.018
I already decided that I'm not
gonna hook up with Matty again

01:44.020 --> 01:45.186
until we D.T.R.'d

01:45.188 --> 01:48.256
Confession:
I was terrified to D.T.R.

01:48.258 --> 01:50.591
I just needed a sign
that I should have the convo.

01:50.593 --> 01:51.926
Yeah!

01:51.928 --> 01:53.328
Any sign...

01:53.330 --> 01:56.164
To fall into my lap.

01:58.326 --> 02:01.614

02:04.306 --> 02:05.974
Thanks for
the info vomit at lunch.

02:05.976 --> 02:08.241
You know I don't have a filter.

02:08.244 --> 02:10.011
[Sighs] Do you think
I should talk to Matty

02:10.013 --> 02:11.044
about our status?

02:11.047 --> 02:12.780
Mm, no.

02:16.318 --> 02:17.785
Did you see that?

02:17.787 --> 02:19.120
She has pink eye too.

02:19.122 --> 02:21.622
J, you need to hold off
on the Matty chitchat

02:21.624 --> 02:23.157
and wait for him to do it.

02:23.159 --> 02:24.993
The last thing you wanna do
is get all status clingy.

02:24.995 --> 02:27.195
I mean, you could have
hooked up with someone too.

02:27.197 --> 02:28.629
Like Chris Jones.

02:28.631 --> 02:29.630
He was at Lissa's.

02:32.001 --> 02:33.668
What is up with
all the conjuncta-funk?

02:33.670 --> 02:34.902
Is there an epidemic?

02:36.739 --> 02:39.507
[Toilets flushing]

02:39.509 --> 02:41.409
[Eerie music]

02:43.879 --> 02:46.080
My eye is itching like crazy.

02:46.082 --> 02:47.882
Ew, don't touch it.
That [Bleep] spreads.

02:47.884 --> 02:53.021
Like that rumor that we got it
from an orgy at Lissa's.

02:53.023 --> 02:54.022
Well, you are.

02:54.024 --> 02:55.289
I know.

02:55.291 --> 02:56.357
Ahem.

02:58.160 --> 03:00.628
[Toilets flushing]

03:01.997 --> 03:04.132
- Was there an orgy at Lissa's?
- Evidently.

03:04.134 --> 03:05.800
And get this.

03:06.902 --> 03:07.969
I was part of it!

03:07.971 --> 03:09.771
I mean, I wasn't really
part of it,

03:09.773 --> 03:11.105
but everyone will think I was.

03:11.107 --> 03:12.240
Oh, my God,
this is so much better

03:12.242 --> 03:13.474
than a red cup photo.

03:13.476 --> 03:15.309
Now, I have red cup on my face.

03:15.311 --> 03:17.278
Okay, so there was
an orgy at lissa's.

03:17.280 --> 03:18.846
Well, it was just
a make-out orgy.

03:18.848 --> 03:20.281
For, like, ten minutes.

03:20.283 --> 03:22.016
In the hot tub.

03:22.018 --> 03:24.185
Did Matty kiss anyone,
besides Michelle?

03:24.187 --> 03:25.720
I wasn't tracking his activity.

03:25.722 --> 03:28.089
Although, he wasn't in the hot
tub when the action went down.

03:28.091 --> 03:29.991
So he could have been hooking
up with someone in the house?

03:29.993 --> 03:31.959
It's possible.

03:31.961 --> 03:33.394
No filter, remember?

03:38.500 --> 03:41.335
Watch where
you're going, poser.

03:41.337 --> 03:43.838
Sideshow.

03:45.441 --> 03:47.041
"Poser"?

03:47.043 --> 03:48.576
She wasn't even in the hot tub.

03:48.578 --> 03:50.344
I'm calling shenanigans
on that eye.

03:50.346 --> 03:51.813
I guarantee she used lip liner

03:51.815 --> 03:53.981
and strategically placed blush.

03:53.983 --> 03:55.016
I need a better look.

03:56.919 --> 03:59.153
I had asked the universe
for a sign

03:59.155 --> 04:00.455
that I should talk to Matty,

04:00.457 --> 04:03.224
and so far, I had six.

04:06.595 --> 04:07.662
Make that seven.

04:07.664 --> 04:10.164
The D.T.R had to happen
A.S.A.P.,

04:10.166 --> 04:12.967
and, O.M.G., I really needed
to stop using initials.

04:15.471 --> 04:16.803
Hey.

04:16.805 --> 04:18.839
I couldn't see
Matty's right eye.

04:18.841 --> 04:20.475
I didn't hurt you
at lunch, did I?

04:20.476 --> 04:22.977
No, but I bet that fall
hurt you.

04:22.979 --> 04:24.545
Or at least
your precious cargo.

04:24.547 --> 04:27.381
Yeah...Yeah.

04:27.383 --> 04:29.350
So am I gonna see you
at the bonfire tonight?

04:29.352 --> 04:31.819
The bigger question,
was he gonna be able to see me?

04:31.821 --> 04:35.022
I think so.

04:35.024 --> 04:36.657
Hey, so Alyssa's kickback...

04:36.659 --> 04:38.926
I'm sorry if I was weird
or whatever.

04:38.928 --> 04:40.962
I was pretty faded.

04:40.964 --> 04:44.465
I just didn't really know
what I was saying.

04:44.467 --> 04:46.167
Or doing.

04:46.169 --> 04:47.401
I'm not making any sense, am I?

04:47.403 --> 04:49.971
Matty was apologizing
for kissing a skank.

04:49.973 --> 04:51.873
Or maybe I was the skank.

04:51.875 --> 04:54.041
So, listen, um...
[Cell phone chimes]

04:54.043 --> 04:55.610
There's been something
I wanted to talk to you about.

04:55.612 --> 04:57.078
Shoot, I gotta go.

04:57.080 --> 04:58.713
Talk later? Okay.

04:58.715 --> 05:01.048
New deal: If Matty
didn't have the pink,

05:01.050 --> 05:02.316
it would clear the stink.

05:02.318 --> 05:05.119
If he did,
I'd have to have the talk.

05:05.121 --> 05:06.387
And that was gonna be...

05:06.389 --> 05:07.588
Awkward!

05:07.590 --> 05:09.423
[Both laugh]

05:09.425 --> 05:11.692
Oh, darn.

05:11.694 --> 05:14.061
So, uh, you going
to the bonfire?

05:14.063 --> 05:16.764
Oh, if you're gonna be there.

05:16.766 --> 05:18.499
Well, it's required.

05:18.501 --> 05:20.168
Ahem, ahem.

05:20.170 --> 05:22.904
Um, I'll see you later, val.

05:22.906 --> 05:23.971
Yes, you will.

05:23.973 --> 05:25.006
Hey, Jenna.

05:26.909 --> 05:29.443
So I'm trying to figure
something out with a guy.

05:29.445 --> 05:30.711
Me too.

05:30.713 --> 05:32.280
And it concerns other girls.

05:32.282 --> 05:33.581
Oh, is he married?

05:33.583 --> 05:36.350
No, he's in high school.

05:36.352 --> 05:38.186
I'm trying to figure out
when to D.T.R.

05:42.591 --> 05:43.891
[Door slams]

05:43.893 --> 05:46.360
Have you ever
D.T.R.'d before?

05:46.362 --> 05:48.062
No, and I'm not even sure
I know how to do it.

05:48.064 --> 05:50.565
It's--I had a chance
earlier today.

05:50.567 --> 05:51.899
It was on the tip of my tongue.

05:51.901 --> 05:53.801
Wait a minute, "it"
was on the tip of your tongue?

05:53.803 --> 05:55.203
Earlier today?

05:55.205 --> 05:56.470
[Snickers]

05:56.472 --> 05:57.705
Where were you?

05:57.707 --> 05:58.973
By my locker.

05:58.975 --> 06:00.741
So you're
one of <i>those</i> girls.

06:00.743 --> 06:03.911
Any...way, I was...

06:03.913 --> 06:05.346
I was trying to get it
out of my mouth,

06:05.348 --> 06:06.614
and I just couldn't
spit it out.

06:06.616 --> 06:08.082
So you swallowed?

06:08.084 --> 06:09.383
Yeah, I guess.
I held it in.

06:09.385 --> 06:11.319
[Aggravated sigh]
Sometimes we feel a pressure

06:11.321 --> 06:12.620
to hold it in.

06:12.622 --> 06:15.122
But you need to do
whatever's comfortable for you.

06:15.124 --> 06:16.290
And if he's worth it,

06:16.292 --> 06:18.092
he will not judge you
for spitting it out.

06:18.094 --> 06:20.461
Really? I just--
I don't wanna scare him off.

06:20.463 --> 06:23.064
Scare <i>him</i> off?
I hate the double standard.

06:23.066 --> 06:25.333
It's like we're supposed
to swallow everything,

06:25.335 --> 06:27.235
but when they get down
to business with us,

06:27.237 --> 06:28.903
they can just spit freely.

06:28.905 --> 06:32.473
I'm not...Sure we're talking
about the same thing here.

06:32.475 --> 06:34.675
What are you talking about?

06:34.677 --> 06:38.713
D.T.R.
"Define the relationship."

06:38.715 --> 06:40.948
- Oh.
- So what should I do?

06:40.950 --> 06:42.250
My gut says just spit it out.

06:42.252 --> 06:44.318
Oh, no.
N-n-n-n-no.

06:44.320 --> 06:46.954
Suppress your reflex.
Definitely swallow.

06:46.956 --> 06:48.923
[School bell ringing]

06:48.925 --> 06:50.258
Did you talk to Matty?

06:50.260 --> 06:51.959
We spoke, but, you know,

06:51.961 --> 06:53.194
it's pretty clear
things are good.

06:53.196 --> 06:54.462
We didn't have to get specific.

06:54.464 --> 06:56.697
Clear without being specific?

06:56.699 --> 06:58.332
What does that even mean?

06:58.334 --> 07:00.001
It's like, you know, actions
speak louder than words.

07:00.003 --> 07:01.769
We're gonna hang out
at the bonfire tonight.

07:01.771 --> 07:04.472
Remember, you promised
not to hook up again

07:04.474 --> 07:05.706
without clarity,

07:05.708 --> 07:07.208
so you better get it soon,

07:07.210 --> 07:09.277
before you're dumpster humping
without a safety net.

07:09.279 --> 07:10.611
What?

07:10.613 --> 07:12.913
The bonfire is a scam fest.

07:12.915 --> 07:16.717
After the fire dies down,
everything else heats up.

07:16.719 --> 07:18.919
And thanks for keeping me
in the loop.

07:18.921 --> 07:19.954
Not.

07:19.956 --> 07:20.988
Ming, I'm sorry.

07:20.990 --> 07:22.823
I just--
Mckibben, of course.

07:22.825 --> 07:24.392
I'm gonna ask him
for a ride to the bonfire,

07:24.394 --> 07:26.227
and then I'm gonna
give him a ride.

07:26.229 --> 07:27.528
[Girls laugh]

07:27.530 --> 07:29.930
I had to get to Matty
before Michelle.

07:29.932 --> 07:33.834
Whether I liked it or not,
it was time to D.T.R.

07:36.538 --> 07:38.572
Move it!

07:38.574 --> 07:40.741
My legs were moving
pretty fast.

07:40.743 --> 07:42.376
And it seemed like they knew
where they were going

07:42.378 --> 07:43.978
before I did.

07:46.548 --> 07:48.916
Jenna!
Can you believe

07:48.918 --> 07:50.151
how many people
got the Scarlet eye

07:50.153 --> 07:51.719
from Lissa's party?
We dodged a bullet.

07:51.721 --> 07:54.588
Yes, big...Pink bullet.

07:54.590 --> 07:56.023
Um, hey, thanks again

07:56.025 --> 07:58.225
for ditching
out of the party with me.

07:58.227 --> 07:59.460
It was the best part
of the night.

07:59.462 --> 08:01.162
Yeah, it was.

08:01.164 --> 08:02.797
Love to talk, but I gotta
finish speed walking

08:02.799 --> 08:03.864
for, uh, gym.

08:03.866 --> 08:05.433
As I felt the crazy
creeping in,

08:05.435 --> 08:07.101
I blamed conjunctivitis.
[Horn honks]

08:09.271 --> 08:10.871
And me.

08:10.873 --> 08:12.573
And three godforsaken letters:

08:12.575 --> 08:14.008
D.T.R.

08:14.994 --> 08:17.528
Remember our sophomore bonfire?

08:17.530 --> 08:20.798
Ohh, I was wearing
that green suede skirt.

08:20.800 --> 08:22.109

I felt like everything
d changed.

17:34.118 --> 17:36.084
But nothing had changed.

17:36.086 --> 17:38.353
Except I finally
knew the score.

17:38.355 --> 17:40.088
I wasn't cool with it.

17:40.090 --> 17:41.723
I'm cool with it.

Cool.

17:47.197 --> 17:48.363
You think I could get a ride?

Mm-hmm.

17:50.167 --> 17:51.600
Okay.

17:51.602 --> 17:55.304
The scorch from my rejection
was still lingering.

17:55.306 --> 17:56.505
And the fact that my dad

17:56.507 --> 17:58.574
was driving 15 miles
under the speed limit

17:58.576 --> 18:00.509
was only prolonging my hell.

You know, Jenna,

18:31.075 --> 18:32.374
I was just thinking.

If he was gonna
say something about Matty,

18:34.478 --> 18:37.145
I was gonna lose it.

18:37.147 --> 18:38.447
When you were a little girl,

18:38.449 --> 18:40.916
you used to really
like seahorses.

18:49.259 --> 18:50.721
For weeks,
I'd assumed the letter

18:50.846 --> 18:53.538
was an evil indictment
of the person who wrote it.

18:53.540 --> 18:55.674
But then it hit me.

18:55.676 --> 18:59.444
What if the author was just
trying to be honest?

18:59.446 --> 19:01.079
I couldn't hate them for that.

19:01.081 --> 19:02.481
Just like I couldn't
hate Matty.

19:02.483 --> 19:04.349
He had been honest,

19:04.351 --> 19:09.254
something I wasn't
brave enough to do.

19:09.256 --> 19:10.555

Hi.

19:21.802 --> 19:24.236
I didn't tell you
about Matty because, um,

19:24.238 --> 19:25.604
I didn't want you to judge me.

19:25.606 --> 19:28.140
I was just telling you
the truth.

19:28.142 --> 19:29.174
I know.

19:29.176 --> 19:30.609
Sometimes, the truth
is hard to hear.

19:32.612 --> 19:35.447
Matty told me he didn't want
to be in a relationship with me.

19:35.449 --> 19:37.716
I'm sorry.

the bark control shock collar of our dog,

a person's success is directly
related to the size of her boobs.
