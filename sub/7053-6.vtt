No, he was

Has he visited a hospital

07:31.196 --> 07:34.244

Why?

07:36.011 --> 07:38.023

08:01.585 --> 08:02.457
After the third death,

I was contacted
by an Eastern European man.

08:05.438 --> 08:06.961
He knew
case-specific details.

08:07.235 --> 08:09.049
Details that only
the killer would have known.

08:13.847 --> 08:15.024
He offered
to turn himself in,

but only if we could
decipher his formula.

08:18.002 --> 08:18.888
What formula?

08:24.002 --> 08:25.388
It's a molecular model.

08:27.434 --> 08:29.494
Some kind of complex
organic compound.

08:29.529 --> 08:31.182

of these elements,

Which hospital?

09:02.882 --> 09:04.200
Uh, Latchmere General.

10:48.272 --> 10:50.221
You think some sort
of radiation passed through him?

10:50.549 --> 10:53.419
We all carry low amounts
of radiation.

<i>But that equation
describes something organic</i>

in the mid to low hundreds.

This doesn't make
any sense.

11:15.083 --> 11:19.215

11:31.255 --> 11:33.977
Hey. Has Walter made
any headway on the body?

11:34.249 --> 11:36.532
Just that it doesn't
contain any radiation.

11:36.567 --> 11:38.267
Otherwise it's just
a pile of dust.

11:38.591 --> 11:39.952

11:40.416 --> 11:41.246
<i>He hasn't cracked it yet,</i>

11:41.306 --> 11:43.462

And as of
a couple hours ago,

<i>This won't stop until

<i>You have ten seconds

16:32.455 --> 16:34.113

16:37.442 --> 16:39.038
<i>They simply

16:58.232 --> 16:58.763
<i>BROYLES:

16:58.834 --> 17:00.486
<i>that we had to meet
face-to-face, Senator?</i>

17:01.221 --> 17:03.409
Phillip, when you filed those
fingerprints on your suspect,

17:03.444 --> 17:04.423
it went wide.

17:04.488 --> 17:06.729
The Bureau,
Homeland, CIA.

17:07.122 --> 17:08.608
Flag went up in Langley.

17:08.935 --> 17:10.559
They're gonna take
this case from you

17:10.594 --> 17:11.805
and demand
you cease and desist.

17:11.839 --> 17:14.946
I support interdepartmental
transparency 100%.

17:16.087 --> 17:17.863
But this was my case
four years ago,

17:17.897 --> 17:19.317
and it will remain
my case.

17:20.832 --> 17:23.097
Your suspect is at
the center of an ongoing

17:23.132 --> 17:26.358
international investigation
led by the Russian government.

17:26.394 --> 17:27.492
By that definition alone,

17:27.542 --> 17:29.079
- it falls--
- Why are they searching for him?

17:29.955 --> 17:31.796
CIA and the Russians?

17:32.178 --> 17:33.330
What value does
he have to them?

17:33.365 --> 17:33.832
Who is he?

17:33.867 --> 17:35.084
According to
a statement made

17:35.119 --> 17:36.743
by one of their
deputy prime ministers,

17:36.803 --> 17:38.418
he illegally removed
some property

17:38.479 --> 17:40.098
belonging to
the Russian federation.

17:40.133 --> 17:42.162
Property?
A weapon?

17:42.229 --> 17:43.395
Is that what's
killing these people?

17:43.430 --> 17:44.021
I don't know.

17:44.101 --> 17:45.449
Within the last hour
this case has been

17:45.500 --> 17:47.299
kicked three floors
above both our heads.

17:47.395 --> 17:49.647
You're a sitting member of the
Senate Intelligence Committee,

17:49.688 --> 17:51.755
- a former FBI agent.
- I'm not CIA.

17:51.862 --> 17:54.080
There was a time, Dennis,
that you would say that

17:54.120 --> 17:56.047
as a matter of pride,
not an excuse.

17:59.495 --> 18:02.108
I understand what
this case means to you.

18:04.762 --> 18:05.695
But I am sorry.

18:05.855 --> 18:07.196
There is nothing
I can do here.

18:17.562 --> 18:19.781
Please give my regards
to Patricia.

18:41.330 --> 18:42.076
Oof.

19:00.629 --> 19:01.604
[pants]

19:04.862 --> 19:07.373
So this is all the surveillance
footage from the fourth floor.

19:07.462 --> 19:08.441
[cell phone rings]

19:10.329 --> 19:12.227
Excuse me.
Hey.

19:12.449 --> 19:13.142
Where are you?

19:13.562 --> 19:15.623
I'm at Latchmere Hospital
just going over

19:15.658 --> 19:17.140
security footage
from last night.

19:17.275 --> 19:18.795
I've just been informed
that the suspect

19:18.796 --> 19:20.130
known to us
as Tomas Koslov

19:20.180 --> 19:22.449
is wanted by the CIA
and the Russian government.

19:22.734 --> 19:24.578
The CIA is now
handling the case.

19:24.795 --> 19:26.791
And they just expect you
to hand it over?

19:26.792 --> 19:27.316
<i>Yes...</i>

19:28.049 --> 19:29.677
but I intend
to do no such thing.

19:30.097 --> 19:31.269
<i>From this point forward,</i>

19:31.304 --> 19:32.975
<i>don't put anything down
on paper,</i>

19:33.027 --> 19:34.155
<i>no documentation.</i>

19:34.363 --> 19:36.528
Anything we need to say to each
other, we'll do it in person.

19:36.753 --> 19:38.238
With all due
respect, sir,

19:38.263 --> 19:40.249
I know that this case
is important to you,

19:40.729 --> 19:43.789
but, when we break the rules,
we've got you to protect us.

19:44.050 --> 19:45.305
Who's gonna
protect you?

19:45.363 --> 19:48.380
<i>I'm afraid that if you don't
comply with a direct order--</i>

19:48.415 --> 19:50.658
Agent Dunham,
I'm aware of the risks.

19:50.996 --> 19:51.559
Agent?

19:54.096 --> 19:55.644
Hang on. We might
have something.

19:57.290 --> 19:59.820
This is the adjacent hallway
to the crime scene.

20:00.140 --> 20:01.544
<i>This is 23 seconds</i>

20:01.579 --> 20:03.029
<i>before the victim
was discovered.</i>

20:05.562 --> 20:08.179
- Did you see that?
- Yeah. A man's shadow.

20:08.695 --> 20:11.545
So can you get a better
angle on his face?

20:11.769 --> 20:13.349
<i>GUARD: Yes, this is
a different angle,</i>

20:13.384 --> 20:14.419
<i>same hallway.</i>

20:14.531 --> 20:16.057
<i>We should see him
head-on here.</i>

20:16.462 --> 20:18.396
The light here
would register an image.

20:18.446 --> 20:19.283
[rewinding noise]

20:20.316 --> 20:22.015
<i>There is no face.</i>

20:22.720 --> 20:23.209
<i>BROYLES: Dunham.</i>

20:23.638 --> 20:24.413
What is it?

20:26.017 --> 20:27.445
I think you're gonna
want to see this.

20:33.835 --> 20:35.371
[indistinct conversations]

20:36.524 --> 20:38.654
<i>WALTER: No reflections
or highlights.</i>

20:38.689 --> 20:40.020
<i>No translucency.</i>

20:40.232 --> 20:41.801
This is clearly
its own entity.

20:41.882 --> 20:43.370
How is that possible?

20:43.758 --> 20:45.674
It's possible
that the technology

20:45.753 --> 20:47.684
that our Russian
friend stole

20:47.719 --> 20:49.635
<i>allows him to become
this shadow.</i>

20:49.809 --> 20:52.116
Are you suggesting that this was
some sort of Russian experiment?

20:52.276 --> 20:54.519
Because they're from the other
side of the world, Peter,

20:54.909 --> 20:56.134
<i>it is so hard
to believe</i>

20:56.169 --> 20:59.718
that they would have their own
stripe of the inconceivable?

21:00.568 --> 21:03.271
Really I'm always amazed
at their advancements.

21:03.306 --> 21:04.869
Even 40 years ago.

21:05.063 --> 21:07.562
You wouldn't believe
what those pinkos were up to.

21:07.708 --> 21:09.029
Russian fringe science.

21:10.707 --> 21:11.833
<i>There's
a pleasant thought.</i>

21:16.209 --> 21:17.020
Agent Broyles,

21:18.503 --> 21:20.025
this just came in
from D.C.

21:20.809 --> 21:22.190
- Senator Van Horn's office.
- [elevator bell dings]

22:00.708 --> 22:02.087
It turns out that
it wasn't technology

22:02.156 --> 22:03.718
that Timur stole
six years ago.

22:03.854 --> 22:06.121
- He abducted his brother.
- The cosmonaut.

22:06.142 --> 22:08.187
Officially,
the Russian space agency states

22:08.222 --> 22:09.316
he died in space.

22:09.396 --> 22:10.179
He didn't.

22:10.330 --> 22:12.368
Why would they say
he's dead if he's not?

22:12.403 --> 22:13.567
What happened
to him up there?

22:13.753 --> 22:15.951
According to these documents,
they still don't understand.

22:16.533 --> 22:18.381
Are you saying
the cosmonaut's the shadow?

22:18.382 --> 22:18.996
I don't know.

22:19.582 --> 22:21.944
But what is clear is
Timur took his brother

22:21.979 --> 22:23.545
from the secret
quarantine facility

22:23.580 --> 22:24.560
where he was being studied.

22:24.881 --> 22:25.403
Took?

22:25.771 --> 22:27.681
He returned from his mission
in a coma.

22:28.287 --> 22:30.284
And Timur's been working
in a coma ward

22:30.319 --> 22:31.820
both here and in D.C.

22:32.175 --> 22:33.816
I think Timur's been moving
his brother around

22:33.883 --> 22:35.428
from hospital to hospital
and guarding him.

22:35.549 --> 22:37.244
So where's his brother now?

22:37.616 --> 22:39.283
Presumably still
at Latchmere Hospital.

22:39.582 --> 22:41.679
No bodies have been removed
from the coma ward

22:41.714 --> 22:42.634
for the past two weeks.

22:42.716 --> 22:44.143
Okay, well,
I'll get a team together.

22:44.449 --> 22:44.978
We're good.

22:45.880 --> 22:47.039
<i>We're ready
to go there now.</i>

22:51.082 --> 22:53.692
So Walter and I were discussing
how radiation pertains

22:53.727 --> 22:55.600
- to this formula--
- Yes, which led to a theory

22:55.660 --> 22:56.500
about the shadow.

22:56.616 --> 23:01.038
Initially, I assumed there
would be a radiation surplus

23:01.109 --> 23:02.816
in the victim
from the penthouse.

23:03.195 --> 23:04.148
<i>I was mistaken.</i>

23:04.589 --> 23:06.549
It's not the radiation
that's killing them.

23:06.616 --> 23:07.886
Quite the opposite.

23:08.883 --> 23:12.028
It's the radiation
that the entity is after.

23:12.419 --> 23:14.807
This thing passes
through victims

23:14.842 --> 23:17.165
to absorb radiation?

23:17.200 --> 23:18.859
And disintegrates them
in the process.

23:18.894 --> 23:20.909
All five of the victims were
undergoing radiation treatment

23:20.944 --> 23:21.859
at the time
of their deaths.

23:21.894 --> 23:24.221
Um, except
for the penthouse guy.

23:24.249 --> 23:25.250
He died of bad luck.

23:25.285 --> 23:26.997
The day that he visited
Latchmere General,

23:27.032 --> 23:29.111
he took a cross-country flight
in a window seat.

23:29.146 --> 23:30.531
30,000 feet
closer to the Sun.

23:30.582 --> 23:32.082
It's like getting
a big fat head X-ray.

23:32.149 --> 23:34.429
So this thing followed him
from the hospital?

23:35.003 --> 23:36.989
I'm not gonna sleep
for weeks.

23:47.717 --> 23:48.941
[keyboard clacking]

23:52.909 --> 23:53.729
[power turns off]

23:55.032 --> 23:55.967
I'll go check the patients.

23:56.018 --> 23:56.535
Okay.

23:57.749 --> 23:58.594
[phone rings]

23:59.189 --> 23:59.729

24:00.575 --> 24:02.514
Yeah, the lights and all
the security monitors are down.

24:02.895 --> 24:03.801
We're going
to backup power.

24:04.816 --> 24:05.464
Okay.

24:21.200 --> 24:22.073
Tomas.

24:23.217 --> 24:24.007
What are you doing here?

24:24.042 --> 24:24.910
It's not your shift.

24:25.583 --> 24:27.048
It's hard to explain.

24:28.315 --> 24:29.784
I have to disconnect
the patient.

24:29.819 --> 24:31.500
I need it
to confuse the monitors.

24:31.535 --> 24:33.262

see me take him.</i>

24:33.592 --> 24:34.493

24:34.707 --> 24:36.651
I wish you hadn't
seen me here.

24:43.337 --> 24:44.822
Are all the patients
accounted for?

24:45.549 --> 24:46.711
Are they accounted for?

24:46.746 --> 24:48.384
Yes!
Every bed.

24:48.667 --> 24:50.865
But, Maxine,
she came in here

Hey.

26:15.363 --> 26:18.081
How long has he been
at it like this?

26:18.934 --> 26:19.570
Three hours.

26:20.253 --> 26:22.067
Don't touch!
Don't touch!

26:24.797 --> 26:25.663
Olivia?

26:26.597 --> 26:27.761
Agent Broyles.

26:28.129 --> 26:29.451
What a pleasant surprise.

26:34.663 --> 26:36.370
As unlikely as it seems,

26:36.396 --> 26:39.231
is it possible that this cosmonaut
somehow is our killer?

26:39.612 --> 26:41.138
It wasn't the cosmonaut.

26:41.330 --> 26:43.759
But it could be something
inside him.

26:43.863 --> 26:46.138
<i>It's possible that,
while in outer space,</i>

26:46.219 --> 26:49.649
the cosmonaut took
a spacewalk

26:49.730 --> 26:51.181
and brought something back
with him.

<i>It's like when a ventriloquist

as the shadow,

28:22.396 --> 28:25.797
<i>Message received 6:45 p.m.</i>

28:25.863 --> 28:28.897
<i>(Broyles)
this is speCIAl agent Broyles
from the FBI.</i>

28:28.964 --> 28:31.430
<i>I'm the agent you spoke with
four years ago.</i>

28:31.496 --> 28:33.430
I have information
about the formula for you.

28:33.496 --> 28:37.897
Call me at 617-555-0118.

30:15.129 --> 30:17.396
<i>(Walter)
I've been thinking
too linearly.</i>

30:17.463 --> 30:21.229
Deductive.
Restrictive.

30:21.296 --> 30:23.597
I must expand my thinking.

30:23.663 --> 30:25.463
If you're looking
for your acid tabs, Walter,

30:25.530 --> 30:26.597
don't bother.
I threw 'em out.

30:26.663 --> 30:29.030
[chuckles]

30:29.096 --> 30:30.930
no, son, this is not a job

30:30.997 --> 30:34.330
for the purple blotter.

30:34.396 --> 30:40.030
The right tool
for this job...

30:40.096 --> 30:42.096
is tinker toys.

30:42.163 --> 30:45.229
<i>(Astrid)
okay. All he has to do
is call in,</i>

30:45.296 --> 30:46.663
<i>and we can trace it.</i>

31:08.663 --> 31:11.229
I've been wanting
to ask you something.

31:14.730 --> 31:18.496
Why this one?

31:18.563 --> 31:24.330
Why is this case
so important to you?

31:36.730 --> 31:41.064
Four years ago,
when this case happened,

31:41.129 --> 31:42.563
it was at a moment
in time

31:42.630 --> 31:45.730
that fringe division
had fallen out of favor.

31:45.797 --> 31:47.363
The government was siphoning
money away from us

31:47.430 --> 31:53.096
for things that had more...
public results.

31:53.163 --> 31:54.430
But at a certain point,
I stopped caring

31:54.496 --> 31:58.563
about my profile
or promotions.

31:58.630 --> 32:01.697
I just wanted to make
the world a safer place.

32:06.930 --> 32:09.930
Anyway...

32:09.997 --> 32:13.229
I became obsessed
with this case.

32:13.296 --> 32:16.663
And for my wife...

32:16.730 --> 32:22.229
it was the straw
that broke the camel's back.

32:22.296 --> 32:24.563
It ended our marriage.

32:29.964 --> 32:32.196
I took this job
to make the world a safer place

32:32.263 --> 32:36.229
for my family.

32:36.296 --> 32:40.396
Instead, I lost them.

33:08.064 --> 33:11.030
That's it. Physical
representation of the formula.

33:21.296 --> 33:22.997
Something wrong?

33:23.064 --> 33:25.064
Could you hold
that end, please, Peter?

33:37.163 --> 33:39.263
Oh, no.

33:56.897 --> 33:58.597
[phone rings]
that's him.

33:58.663 --> 34:02.697
Call dr. Bishop.

34:02.763 --> 34:05.530
This is agent Broyles.

34:05.597 --> 34:07.296
<i>I saw you in the hospital.</i>

34:07.363 --> 34:08.362
I thought you might have.

34:08.429 --> 34:09.730
In your message, you said

34:09.797 --> 34:12.697
you had new information
about the formula.

34:12.763 --> 34:13.730
That's right.

34:13.797 --> 34:15.330
Have you solved it
this time?

34:15.396 --> 34:17.496
Peter, we've got timur
on the line.

34:17.563 --> 34:18.597
<i>I need Walter.
He's right here.</i>

34:18.663 --> 34:19.597
Hold on a sec.

34:19.663 --> 34:21.597
It's Olivia.

34:21.663 --> 34:22.730
Hello, agent Dunham.

34:22.797 --> 34:26.063
Walter, have you solved
the formula?

34:26.129 --> 34:27.897
<i>It is bad news, unfortunately.</i>

34:27.964 --> 34:30.730
I know, like last time,
you are tapping the line.

34:30.797 --> 34:31.996
You need 60 seconds.

34:32.063 --> 34:35.263
<i>I'm giving you ten
before I hang up.</i>

34:35.330 --> 34:37.263
Don't make the same mistake
again.

34:37.330 --> 34:38.763
<i>(Walter)
I believe the Russians</i>

34:38.830 --> 34:41.030
have tried to remove
the organism

34:41.096 --> 34:42.830
from the cosmonaut--
they couldn't.

34:42.897 --> 34:44.096
<i>It is not possible.</i>

34:44.163 --> 34:47.463
The two have become one.

34:47.530 --> 34:49.228
Bonded at a molecular level.

34:49.295 --> 34:51.063
<i>They can't be separated.</i>

34:51.129 --> 34:53.663
<i>You can't kill the organism
without killing them both.</i>

34:53.730 --> 34:56.330
Agent.
I'm going to hang up now.

34:56.396 --> 35:00.330
We have the answer,
timur.

35:00.396 --> 35:01.563
But I don't think
it's the one you want to hear.

35:01.630 --> 35:03.797
<i>I'm afraid your brother</i>

35:03.863 --> 35:06.263
and whatever's inside of him

35:06.330 --> 35:07.797
have become one and the same.

35:07.863 --> 35:09.863
<i>But the people I work with,</i>

35:09.930 --> 35:12.697
<i>if anyone can help
your brother, they can.</i>

35:12.763 --> 35:14.964
But we'll need
to see your brother.

35:18.663 --> 35:20.263
<i>Timur?</i>

35:22.897 --> 35:24.730
Timur?

35:28.496 --> 35:30.163
I don't want him harmed.

35:30.229 --> 35:32.997
Just ten more seconds.

35:33.064 --> 35:34.430
Tell me where you are,
timur.

35:34.496 --> 35:38.396
I have managed
to keep it at bay.

35:38.463 --> 35:41.530
He's not going to hurt
anyone else.

35:41.597 --> 35:43.496
<i>For now.
We'll take care of him.</i>

35:43.563 --> 35:46.363
I want this to end
as much as you do.

35:46.430 --> 35:50.163
But you've got to tell me
where you are, timur.

35:50.229 --> 35:55.930
<i>You can trust us.</i>

35:55.997 --> 35:57.530
<i>Timur?</i>

36:10.996 --> 36:11.963
I've got him.

36:12.029 --> 36:14.830
His line's still open.

36:14.896 --> 36:16.896
Start triangulating
the position.

36:27.630 --> 36:28.896
<i>Van door's open.</i>

36:28.963 --> 36:30.764
He's moving his brother.

37:04.363 --> 37:05.463
Hold on,
you need the vest

37:05.530 --> 37:09.029
if you're going
to touch the body.

37:09.096 --> 37:13.363
Pupils dilated.
His breathing's normal.

37:13.430 --> 37:14.730
For a coma.

37:14.797 --> 37:16.630
What's with all
these jumper cables?

37:16.697 --> 37:18.896
Agent Broyles said

37:18.963 --> 37:21.263
that timur was certain
he could contain it.

37:21.330 --> 37:24.063
Perhaps so by administering
electric shocks,

37:24.130 --> 37:25.263
<i>distressing the cosmonaut.</i>

37:25.330 --> 37:26.330
But it didn't work.

37:26.397 --> 37:28.230
Hmm?
It killed timur.

37:29.497 --> 37:30.630
Dr. Bishop,
how will you contain it

37:30.697 --> 37:33.163
<i>before it kills again?</i>

37:33.230 --> 37:35.563
I imagine we would need
a lead case

37:35.630 --> 37:38.330
for starters,
big enough for his entire body.

37:38.397 --> 37:39.929
Oh, no.

37:39.996 --> 37:41.463
<i>(Olivia)
what's wrong?</i>

37:41.530 --> 37:45.096
Before we attempt anything,

37:45.163 --> 37:47.263
we have to wait
until the shadow returns

37:47.330 --> 37:48.263
to the cosmonaut.

37:48.330 --> 37:49.597
<i>There's no radiation.</i>

37:49.663 --> 37:51.663
<i>Which means
the organism is here,</i>

37:51.730 --> 37:54.330
<i>but it's already projected
the shadow elsewhere.</i>

37:54.397 --> 37:55.996
Walter, you said
that timur could contain it

37:56.063 --> 37:57.130
by distressing the host.

37:57.196 --> 37:58.430
Do you think you could draw
the shadow back

37:58.497 --> 37:59.497
doing the same thing?

38:01.263 --> 38:03.430
Walter?
Is that possible?

38:03.497 --> 38:05.397
I don't know.
I don't know how it behaves.

38:05.463 --> 38:06.463
But it could work.

38:06.530 --> 38:07.563
<i>Since they're connected.</i>

38:07.630 --> 38:08.563
I don't know!

38:08.630 --> 38:10.163
<i>Theoretically, yes.</i>

38:10.230 --> 38:11.864
<i>If you hurt the host,
you hurt the organism.</i>

38:11.929 --> 38:13.397
Walter, it's out there now.

38:13.463 --> 38:15.063
<i>Do you think
you could try?</i>

38:15.130 --> 38:17.130
Yes.
Yes.

38:17.196 --> 38:19.263
Yes.

38:19.330 --> 38:22.163
[television chatter]

38:22.230 --> 38:23.296
get rid of him.

38:23.363 --> 38:24.597
I may have a different color,

38:24.663 --> 38:26.730
but I'm still alive--

38:37.764 --> 38:40.096
[machinery hums]
Walter?

38:40.163 --> 38:41.597
This equipment,
it's in Russian.

38:41.663 --> 38:44.163
[girl screams]

38:45.730 --> 38:47.830
stand back!

38:47.896 --> 38:49.363
[gunshot]

38:57.597 --> 39:00.797
tara!
Hey, what's wrong?

39:02.996 --> 39:04.430
What happened?

39:06.230 --> 39:09.463
Hey.

39:19.697 --> 39:21.864
There was a man.

39:21.929 --> 39:24.063
A shadow man.

39:24.130 --> 39:27.130
He disappeared.

39:53.630 --> 39:56.463
[knock at door]

39:56.530 --> 39:57.563
phillip.

39:57.630 --> 39:59.697
Hi.

39:59.764 --> 40:01.963
The kids aren't here.

40:02.029 --> 40:03.697
They--they went over
to sadie's.

40:03.764 --> 40:05.996
Actually,
I came to talk to you.

40:09.963 --> 40:11.864
I just wanted to tell you
that...

40:11.929 --> 40:12.996
hey, phil.

40:13.063 --> 40:14.730
Hey, rob.

40:23.430 --> 40:25.597
I closed that case.

40:29.630 --> 40:30.597
The one four years ago.

40:30.663 --> 40:32.663
Hmm.

40:36.096 --> 40:39.730
I'm happy for you.

40:39.797 --> 40:41.630
I mean that.

40:41.697 --> 40:46.730
Thank you.

40:50.597 --> 40:51.630
Do you want to come in?

40:51.697 --> 40:52.697
Have some dinner
with us?

40:52.764 --> 40:55.096
No.

40:55.163 --> 40:57.363
I, um--

40:57.430 --> 41:01.029
I'll let you get back
to your dinner.

41:01.096 --> 41:02.630
Good night, diane.

41:04.563 --> 41:06.896
Good night, phillip.

41:38.463 --> 41:41.330
<i>(Man)
agent Broyles.</i>

41:41.397 --> 41:47.397
<i>You got a real friend
in senator Van Horn.</i>

41:55.029 --> 41:56.497
Is that so?

41:56.563 --> 41:58.663
<i>When the CIA says,
"cease and desist,"</i>

41:58.730 --> 42:00.929
we kind of mean it.

42:00.996 --> 42:04.230
<i>A person could get
into a lot of trouble.</i>

42:04.296 --> 42:06.230
I guess I should thank
senator Van Horn then.

42:06.296 --> 42:08.764
Understatement.

42:11.597 --> 42:16.163
So, this thing, there isn't
going to be any report.

42:16.230 --> 42:17.263
Right?

42:26.497 --> 42:31.929
Hey.

42:31.996 --> 42:34.530
What did you guys do
with him,

42:34.597 --> 42:35.864
the cosmonaut?

42:35.929 --> 42:37.296
<i>We had no choice.</i>

42:37.363 --> 42:40.463
Once he started
breathing again.
