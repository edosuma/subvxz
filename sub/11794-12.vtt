00:06.973 --> 00:09.843

00:09.876 --> 00:12.779

01:07.867 --> 01:10.503
  ( organ plays
  The Wedding March )

01:25.085 --> 01:27.587
  This is the greatest day
  of my school life.

01:27.620 --> 01:29.956
  As part of
  the social science project,

01:29.989 --> 01:31.891
  I'm marrying Kelly.

01:31.925 --> 01:35.395
 It's the first assignment
 where I can't wait to
 tackle the homework.

01:40.500 --> 01:42.369
   Mr. Belding,
   what are you doing here?

01:42.402 --> 01:45.572
  - I'm here to marry you.
  - Well, you're not my type.

01:45.605 --> 01:47.741
  Button it, Zack, or you'll be
  honeymooning in detention.

01:47.774 --> 01:49.709
Buttoned, sir.

01:49.743 --> 01:51.611
   Class, your regular teacher,
   Miss Laurette,

01:51.644 --> 01:53.513
eloped last night
with the shop teacher.

01:53.546 --> 01:55.815
   So I'm taking her place.

01:55.849 --> 01:57.617
   - Let's get started.
   - Why do I have
   to marry Screech?

01:57.650 --> 02:00.787
Yeah, and why did Preppie
wind up with my Kelly?

02:00.820 --> 02:02.822
  Your Kelly?

02:02.856 --> 02:05.091
  May I remind you, Slater,
  that no woman is
  your possession.

02:05.125 --> 02:08.461
 She's right.
 Kelly's mine.

02:08.495 --> 02:11.431
 Miss Turtle, all the couples
 were matched alphabetically.

02:11.464 --> 02:13.667
 I'm changing
 my name to Zigowitz.

02:15.435 --> 02:17.771
Couples, your grade will be
determined by how well

02:17.804 --> 02:20.073
  you communicate and handle
  life's little differences.

02:20.106 --> 02:23.543
   Now, do you boys
   take these girls

02:23.576 --> 02:25.345
   to be your school wives?

02:25.378 --> 02:26.479
   You bet!

02:26.513 --> 02:27.580
   I guess.

02:27.614 --> 02:29.716
Wahoo!

02:29.749 --> 02:33.086
  That's what Mrs. Belding said
  when we got married.

02:33.119 --> 02:34.721
- Girls?
- I do.

02:34.754 --> 02:36.389
  - I do.
  - I don't!

02:36.423 --> 02:38.725
  Lisa, it's only five days.

02:38.758 --> 02:40.160
Wahoo.

02:40.193 --> 02:43.129
  I now pronounce you
  school husbands and wives.

02:43.163 --> 02:45.899
   Our experiment will conclude
   Friday night at the Max.

02:45.932 --> 02:49.569
Hope you're still speaking
to each other by then.

02:49.602 --> 02:52.005
I think pretend marriage is
a great way to
learn about life.

02:52.105 --> 02:54.808
I think a pretend honeymoon
would be better.

02:54.841 --> 02:56.843
 I'll pretend
 you didn't say that.

02:56.876 --> 02:59.112
 What's wrong with it,
 Mrs. Slater?

02:59.112 --> 03:00.747
 Mrs. Slater?

03:00.780 --> 03:04.351
 If I really married you,
 I wouldn't use your last name.

03:04.384 --> 03:07.387
- Whose last
name would you use?
- Mine.

03:07.420 --> 03:09.522
  This chick's crazy.

03:09.556 --> 03:13.093
I bet you want me
to have the kids, too?

03:13.126 --> 03:15.061
  If you think you have
  the stomach for it.

03:15.061 --> 03:16.963
  Very funny.

03:17.063 --> 03:18.665
  But I would expect you
  to stay home and
  take care of them.

03:18.698 --> 03:22.068
 Lots of men take
 care of the kids
 when the wife works.

03:22.068 --> 03:24.838
   The wife works.
   Hey, I like that concept.

03:24.871 --> 03:27.841
 I stay home and watch
<i>Young and The Restless.</i>

03:27.874 --> 03:30.443
 You sound like
 "The Blond and The Useless."

03:30.477 --> 03:32.846
  Good one, darling.

03:32.879 --> 03:35.615
  I think humor is very
  important in keeping
  a marriage together.

03:35.648 --> 03:37.951
  Oh, yeah. Other things
  are important, too.

03:37.984 --> 03:39.452
Really, Slater?

03:39.486 --> 03:42.722
 Well, sure. Trust,
 understanding and great legs.

03:42.756 --> 03:44.090
  Zack: Yeah.

03:44.124 --> 03:46.559
  - You macho pig.
  - Oink, oink, baby.

03:50.797 --> 03:52.866
  What do you think is the most
  important thing
  about a marriage?

03:52.899 --> 03:54.934
 That's easy, kissing.

03:54.968 --> 03:57.637
  - That's terrible.
  - Not the way I
  do it, Peach Cake.

04:00.807 --> 04:04.177
  Lisa,
  a wedding surprise for you.

04:04.210 --> 04:06.413
  Wow, is this from you, Max?

04:13.653 --> 04:15.689
 ( instrumental music plays )

04:18.058 --> 04:19.225
 ( knocking on door )

04:19.259 --> 04:20.927
   Come in.

04:30.170 --> 04:32.105
Screech, what are
you doing here?

04:32.138 --> 04:36.076
 Don't talk. Let's go where
 the music takes us.

04:36.076 --> 04:38.745
  It's gonna take you
  right out the door.

04:38.778 --> 04:40.246
   What's with the suitcase?

04:40.280 --> 04:42.749
Now that we're married,
I'm moving in.

04:44.217 --> 04:46.886
 We are not married.
 Take a reality pill.

04:46.920 --> 04:49.222
  You're beautiful
  when you're angry.

04:50.790 --> 04:52.659
 Look what you're doing to me!

04:52.692 --> 04:54.994
  Yeah, you do strange
  things to me, too.

04:56.262 --> 04:58.164
Where do you want
my white mice?

04:58.198 --> 05:01.901
  Inside of a white cat.
  Now will you please leave?

05:01.935 --> 05:04.070
 Don't fight it.
 Tell me how you really feel.

05:04.104 --> 05:05.238
 Out!

05:08.675 --> 05:10.510
 I forgot to kiss you goodbye.

05:10.543 --> 05:11.711
  ( groans )

05:15.048 --> 05:18.618
   Dear Lord,
   thanks for everything
   you've given me today...

05:18.651 --> 05:20.754
 except of course,
 for Screech.

05:33.600 --> 05:35.101
   ( alarm ringing )

05:40.573 --> 05:42.542
   Time to get up, darling.

05:46.846 --> 05:49.616
 The morning sunrise
 is no match for you.

05:52.752 --> 05:54.254
Let's work out.

05:57.090 --> 05:58.892
Help! Someone save me!

06:04.898 --> 06:06.933
   Hold me, honey.
   I'll protect you.

06:23.149 --> 06:25.151
  All right, everyone,
  now today,

06:25.185 --> 06:27.687
 we've turned the classroom
 into a newlyweds' apartment.

06:27.721 --> 06:29.923
Our first couple
is Mr. and Mrs. Slater.

06:29.956 --> 06:32.292
 - Spano-Slater please.
 - How modern.

06:33.126 --> 06:35.161
Here's your situation.

06:35.195 --> 06:37.897
 You both work
 and arrive home at dinnertime.

06:37.931 --> 06:39.899
   And you're hungry, okay?

06:39.933 --> 06:41.234
Places.

06:44.070 --> 06:47.273
Let's watch, darling.
It can only
help us grow together.

06:48.708 --> 06:50.343
  - Okay.
  - I'm home.

06:51.311 --> 06:53.146
  Great, I'm starved.

06:53.179 --> 06:55.782
  Me too. What are you
  fixing for dinner?

06:55.815 --> 06:58.084
  ( scoffs )
  Nothing. I'm a guy.

06:59.085 --> 07:01.154
Slater!

07:01.187 --> 07:03.623
   Well,
   why don't you just call me
   what you usually call me?

07:03.656 --> 07:05.125
 What's that?

07:05.158 --> 07:06.760
  Tiger Man.

07:08.862 --> 07:10.730
  Look, Slater,
  since we both work

07:10.764 --> 07:12.699
 we should share
 the household chores.

07:12.732 --> 07:16.636
- Fine. You cook, I'll eat.
- Zack: Yeah!

07:16.670 --> 07:18.605
   Haven't you ever heard
   of the Women's Movement?

07:18.638 --> 07:22.909
 Well, sure.
 Put on something cute
 and move it into the kitchen.

07:22.942 --> 07:26.046
 Mr. Belding, he doesn't
 want a wife, he wants a maid.

07:26.046 --> 07:29.049
 Would he settle
 for a mother-in-law?

07:29.082 --> 07:31.384
 Okay, then that's the problem
 you two will have to work out.

07:31.418 --> 07:34.821
- Thanks.
- Sure.

07:34.854 --> 07:37.657
   Now, our next couple
   is the Morris-Kapowskis.

07:37.691 --> 07:40.694
   I'm an old-fashioned girl.
   Mrs. Morris will be fine.

07:41.294 --> 07:44.064
  Kelly Morris. Wow.

07:44.064 --> 07:46.332
 I've died and gone to heaven.

07:46.366 --> 07:49.736
 Now, here is their situation.

07:49.769 --> 07:53.073
A tearful Kelly
has wrecked Zack's car.

07:53.073 --> 07:54.741
  ( crowd ''Oohs'' )

07:55.241 --> 07:57.110
Belding: Okay.

07:57.143 --> 07:59.145
  Zack, I've done
  something terrible.

07:59.179 --> 08:01.781
  Who cares? Kiss me.

08:01.815 --> 08:04.818
  Zack, affection does not
  solve all problems.

08:04.851 --> 08:07.354
 - Solves mine.
 - Try again.

08:13.360 --> 08:16.129
   Zack, I totaled
   your new Ferrari.

08:16.162 --> 08:20.400
- I don't know what to say.
- You poor, poor thing.

08:23.136 --> 08:25.438
  You're too upset
  to talk right now.

08:27.040 --> 08:28.675
   Very good, Zack.

08:29.342 --> 08:32.044
Let's kiss until
you calm down.

08:32.044 --> 08:34.414
 Heel, Zack.
 I think you should calm down.

08:36.482 --> 08:39.785
   Now, for our third couple.
   Is it the Turtle-Powers?

08:39.818 --> 08:42.288
 It's the Turtles.
 I'm taking her name.

08:44.324 --> 08:47.894
   Okay, Screech has
   just lost his job

08:47.927 --> 08:50.230
 and comes home
 looking for comfort.

08:51.965 --> 08:53.133
 Lisa?

09:00.006 --> 09:01.307
 Okay.

09:01.341 --> 09:04.411
 Oh, Lisa, Lisa, Lisa.

09:04.444 --> 09:06.813
   ( Spanish accent )
   Lisa <i>no en casa.</i>

09:12.452 --> 09:14.788
I love it
when you speak German.

09:17.424 --> 09:19.325
   What do you want?

09:19.359 --> 09:21.327
  I was fired today.

09:21.361 --> 09:24.030
  So?

09:24.030 --> 09:26.032
 I don't think I have
 the strength to go on living.

09:26.066 --> 09:27.200
 Okay.

09:29.035 --> 09:31.438
  Lisa, your husband
  needs more support.

09:33.473 --> 09:36.743
 Hold me.
 As long as I have you,
 I have the strength to go on.

09:39.779 --> 09:42.182
 ( sneezing )

09:42.215 --> 09:44.084
   Is something wrong, Lisa?

09:44.117 --> 09:45.752
   Mr. Belding,
   I can't go on with this.

09:45.785 --> 09:48.221
   I'm allergic to Screech.

09:48.254 --> 09:50.857
 Darling, I won't leave
 you while you're ill.

09:50.890 --> 09:53.159
 - Let me take care of you.
 - ( Lisa wheezes )

09:53.193 --> 09:56.229
   Whoa. I think you are
   allergic to him.

09:56.262 --> 09:58.531
  I have no choice
  but to annul this marriage.

09:58.565 --> 10:01.101
Annul?

10:01.134 --> 10:03.570
 Does this mean that Lisa
 and I aren't married anymore?

10:03.603 --> 10:05.572
  Afraid so, Screech.

10:07.374 --> 10:09.476
  ( sobbing )

10:09.509 --> 10:11.578
  - Screech.
  - Screech.

10:11.611 --> 10:12.946
 What?

10:22.122 --> 10:24.524
   Now,
   usually, our married couples
   get a sack of flour

10:24.557 --> 10:27.027
 to simulate
 the responsibility of a child.

10:27.060 --> 10:30.930
   Believe me,
   it's the driest baby
   you'll ever have.

10:30.964 --> 10:33.767
But this year
I've changed the rules.

10:33.800 --> 10:36.903
  And guess what,
  they're not babies!

10:36.936 --> 10:38.838
   You're getting teenagers!

10:39.706 --> 10:41.508
Why teenagers?

10:41.541 --> 10:44.878
 So you can understand why
 your parents'
 hair is turning gray.

10:44.911 --> 10:48.048
 - Who are they?
 - I'm glad you asked.

10:48.081 --> 10:51.618
   Behind these two doors
   are a son and a daughter.

10:51.651 --> 10:54.120
It's kind of like,
''Let's Make a Deal.''

10:56.022 --> 10:58.892
   Zack and Kelly,
   why don't you pick first?

11:06.966 --> 11:08.902
Daddy!

11:08.935 --> 11:10.804
   He's not my son.

11:10.837 --> 11:13.173
   There must have been
   a mix-up at the hospital.

11:14.207 --> 11:15.141
  No.

11:17.077 --> 11:18.812
   What a hot mommy.

11:23.616 --> 11:25.819
  Slater, we're both
  having this child.

11:31.591 --> 11:33.860
Lisa, our baby.

11:33.893 --> 11:36.830
  I'm not a baby.
  I'm a young woman.

11:36.863 --> 11:40.533
I want a big allowance,
no curfew,
and my own phone. Okay?

11:42.102 --> 11:44.270
You sound
just like your mother.

11:51.111 --> 11:53.246
Screech, what are you doing
with that toothpaste?

11:53.279 --> 11:55.615
 I'm making
 a symbolic statement.

11:55.648 --> 11:58.318
 Lisa has given me the brush.

11:58.351 --> 12:00.854
  Come on, Screech,
  it's not that bad.

12:00.887 --> 12:04.124
 Oh, yeah? I started out
 the week as a single teenager.

12:04.157 --> 12:06.659
  All of a sudden
  I'm Lisa's husband.

12:06.693 --> 12:08.795
 Now I'm Kelly and Zack's kid.

12:08.828 --> 12:11.898
 By tomorrow
 I'll probably be Jessie's dog.

12:11.931 --> 12:14.067
 Screech, this is just
 make-believe.

12:14.067 --> 12:16.169
   Ha! Maybe for you it was.

12:16.202 --> 12:19.539
  For me it was the real thing.
  My moment in time.

12:19.572 --> 12:22.108
  You got a problem
  with that, dimples?

12:22.142 --> 12:24.110
 Screech, what are you doing?

12:28.348 --> 12:30.917
  All right, look,
  Screech, come out of there.

12:30.950 --> 12:32.952
I'm not gonna hurt you.

12:32.986 --> 12:35.722
   In fact, I think
   I can help you with Lisa.

12:36.623 --> 12:38.725
Help with Lisa?

12:38.758 --> 12:40.593
  I'll be right down.

12:42.796 --> 12:44.164
   Screech? Come on.

12:46.733 --> 12:48.835
 Don't worry, I won't hurt you.

12:48.868 --> 12:51.705
   Now, what about my woman?

12:51.738 --> 12:54.874
Come here.
Lisa's my daughter now,

12:54.908 --> 12:57.210
 and my daughter listens to me
 when it comes to things like

12:57.243 --> 12:59.212
 what boys she dates.

12:59.245 --> 13:01.548
  I thought you said
  that was all make-believe.

13:01.581 --> 13:04.050
But she needs a good grade,
and that's real.

13:04.050 --> 13:06.119
 She has to
 listen to her daddy.

13:06.152 --> 13:08.321
   Would you do that for me?

13:08.355 --> 13:11.091
   That depends on
   what you would do for me.

13:11.124 --> 13:15.061
 I could teach you how to drink
 a Slurpie through your nose.

13:15.095 --> 13:17.063
 Well, that's a start.

13:19.899 --> 13:21.701
 Okay.

13:21.735 --> 13:25.305
So,
dealing with the unexpected
is one of the keys

13:25.338 --> 13:27.607
   to a successful marriage.

13:27.640 --> 13:30.143
   Now, Zack desires a romantic
   evening alone with Kelly.

13:30.176 --> 13:34.180
 - Boy, do I.
 - I am talking
 about the assignment.

13:36.383 --> 13:39.085
  Kelly has plans of her own.

13:39.085 --> 13:40.387
 Okay.

13:41.721 --> 13:43.823
   Honey, I'm home.

13:43.857 --> 13:45.892
   I have
   a surprise for you, Zack.

13:45.925 --> 13:47.127
  A surprise?

13:49.763 --> 13:51.965
 Dad, my bike has a flat tire.

13:51.998 --> 13:53.900
 Put a Band-Aid on it.

13:53.933 --> 13:56.169
 - What were you saying, honey?
 - Zack, he's your child.

13:56.202 --> 14:00.407
- He just wants
your attention.
- Attention? All right.

14:00.440 --> 14:02.642
 I'll give him more attention.

14:02.676 --> 14:04.678
Son...

14:04.711 --> 14:07.647
- get lost.
- Zack?

14:07.681 --> 14:09.649
 Mom, Dad's not relating to me.

14:09.683 --> 14:12.852
He's right, Zack.
That's no way to
 treat your son.

14:12.886 --> 14:15.321
  But you're doing
  a good job, Mom.
 Keep it up.

14:17.957 --> 14:20.193
  Screech, I'm sorry.

14:20.226 --> 14:22.062
 Now let go of Mommy,
 and go to your room.

14:22.095 --> 14:23.830
  No.

14:23.863 --> 14:26.066
   - I'm your father. Go!
   - Mom, call 911!

14:26.066 --> 14:28.335
There's nothing
to worry about.

14:28.368 --> 14:31.805
  Your father loves you.
  Don't you, Zack? Tell him.

14:34.140 --> 14:39.312
  I...I...love you, Screech.

14:40.947 --> 14:43.216
You're just saying that
to get close to Mommy.

14:43.249 --> 14:45.418
 I know, Dad.

14:45.452 --> 14:48.288
 Mr. Belding,
 Screech is acting like a jerk.

14:48.321 --> 14:50.323
 Well, teenagers are often
 annoying one minute,

14:50.357 --> 14:52.092
 and perfect angels the next.

14:52.092 --> 14:53.960
 You should know that.

14:58.431 --> 15:01.101
   Now, what was
   the big surprise for me?

15:01.134 --> 15:03.036
 I'm gonna have another baby.

15:03.036 --> 15:05.238
 Great. That's all I need
 is Screech, part two.

15:05.271 --> 15:07.207
  Wonderful.

15:07.240 --> 15:10.243
  Zack,
  you are a terrible father.
  I don't want to be married

15:10.276 --> 15:12.879
to someone who doesn't
like children.

15:14.114 --> 15:16.816
  Kelly, what are you saying?

15:16.850 --> 15:19.953
   - I'm leaving.
   - I'm going, too.

15:20.053 --> 15:21.921
  I'll send for my ant farm.

15:26.760 --> 15:28.361
This is awful.

15:28.395 --> 15:31.331
 If I can't stay
 married to Kelly,
 she'll never go out with me.

15:36.903 --> 15:39.939
  You know, Jessie, I've been
  selfish about our marriage.

15:39.973 --> 15:42.409
   I'm going to stay home,
   and raise our little Lisa

15:42.442 --> 15:44.978
  so that you can be
  a full-time lawyer.

15:45.078 --> 15:47.213
 Well, Slater, I am impressed.

15:47.247 --> 15:49.215
   Spare me.

15:49.249 --> 15:51.751
 I want to have
 at least seven kids.

15:51.785 --> 15:55.188
Great, so I'll have to take
a number to get
into the bathroom.

15:55.221 --> 15:57.891
Seven kids?
Slater, I don't know--

15:57.924 --> 16:00.026
   No, no, no.
   It's all right, darling.

16:00.026 --> 16:02.429
  I'll give up my career,
  and take care of them all.

16:02.462 --> 16:05.031
  Why?
  Because I'm a good father.

16:07.834 --> 16:09.202
 Knock, knock, knock.

16:09.235 --> 16:12.038
Mr. Spano-Slater, I've come
to take your daughter
Lisa to the movies.

16:12.038 --> 16:14.207
  How sweet.

16:14.240 --> 16:17.410
  Lisa's not home
  right now, so when
  you hear the beep, hang up.

16:17.444 --> 16:19.045
 Beep.

16:19.079 --> 16:21.381
She's home.
I see her right there.

16:21.414 --> 16:24.050
 Well,
 Screech, I'm sorry, buddy.
 I did my best.

16:24.084 --> 16:26.086
Thanks for coming over.

16:26.119 --> 16:27.921
Wait a second.

16:27.954 --> 16:30.757
 You promised me
 a date with Lisa
 if I broke up Kelly and Zack.

16:30.790 --> 16:31.825
- What?
- What?

16:31.858 --> 16:33.326
- What?
- Oops!

16:35.061 --> 16:38.064
  Kids, you never know
  what they're going to say.

16:41.334 --> 16:44.471
 You have made a mockery
 out of mock marriage.

16:44.504 --> 16:47.841
  - I'm failing all of you.
  - Let's be fair
  about this, sir.

16:47.874 --> 16:50.477
   We shouldn't all fail.
   Just Screech and Slater.

16:50.510 --> 16:52.879
   Why me? They're fathers,
   I'm just a kid.

16:52.912 --> 16:55.915
You are all to
blame for bringing
your personal rivalries

16:55.949 --> 16:57.951
  into this project.

16:57.984 --> 17:02.155
  Slater,
  why did you try to break up
  Zack and Kelly's marriage?

17:02.188 --> 17:04.391
Because I wanted
to be married to Kelly.

17:04.424 --> 17:06.492
 Home wrecker.
 You stay away from my mommy.

17:06.526 --> 17:09.029
- She's not your mommy.
- Is that true, Daddy?

17:09.029 --> 17:10.864
  I'm not your daddy!

17:10.896 --> 17:14.733
  Great! Now I'm an orphan.
  What a week!

17:14.768 --> 17:18.338
   Boys, I am very disappointed
   in all of you.

17:18.371 --> 17:22.041
   At least the girls found out
   about you before
   it was too late.

17:25.244 --> 17:27.847
  You're right, Mr. Belding.

17:27.881 --> 17:30.316
  We really acted like jerks.

17:30.350 --> 17:32.152
- We're sorry.
- Yeah.

17:34.087 --> 17:36.322
   Will you let us back
   into the project?

17:36.356 --> 17:39.826
 That's really up to the girls,
 now, isn't it?

17:39.859 --> 17:42.796
 Well, if the girls say no,
 will you be my daddy?

17:52.238 --> 17:54.874
 Max, thanks for letting us use
 your place for our project.

17:54.908 --> 17:56.910
 Think of it
 as another classroom.

18:01.281 --> 18:03.817
 - Good evening.
 - Good evening, Max.

18:06.453 --> 18:08.421
 Your wife and daughter
 are here, Mr. Slater.

18:08.455 --> 18:10.023
Thank you, Max.

18:12.125 --> 18:16.129
Ladies, you both
look dynamite tonight.

18:16.162 --> 18:17.464
   Let me help you
   with this, honey.

18:17.497 --> 18:20.033
It's not necessary,
but thank you.

18:24.537 --> 18:27.507
   I hope you'll forgive me
   for promising you
   to Screech, dear.

18:27.540 --> 18:31.111
  All right, I forgive you.
  Now, let's eat.

18:31.144 --> 18:35.215
  - Can I take your order?
  - I'll order
  for everyone, Max.

18:35.248 --> 18:38.818
  Thank you,
  Slater, but you know
  I like to order for myself.

18:39.919 --> 18:42.322
   I sit corrected.

18:42.355 --> 18:45.191
   What's the most
   expensive thing
   on the menu, Max?

18:45.225 --> 18:49.062
  The most expensive thing
  on the menu,
  would have to be...

18:51.064 --> 18:52.232
   the duck.

19:00.640 --> 19:03.043
 Do you have
 anything that's dead?

19:05.378 --> 19:08.515
  - How about a Max burger?
  - I'll have one
  with everything.

19:08.548 --> 19:10.350
Three Max Burgers, Max.

19:14.220 --> 19:16.923
Slater, you're ordering
for me again.

19:17.023 --> 19:21.061
 I can't help it, Jessie.
 I think
 the husband should be the man.

19:21.094 --> 19:23.229
   If the husband's a real man,
   he wouldn't be threatened

19:23.263 --> 19:25.565
by a woman who knows
what she wants.

19:29.936 --> 19:33.440
  You know, Jessie,
  you're really a great girl,

19:33.473 --> 19:36.376
 but I think we should break up
 before I send you to the moon.

19:38.645 --> 19:41.548
 Slater, what about our grade?

19:41.581 --> 19:44.117
  Jessie, two people like us

19:44.150 --> 19:46.586
   should never be married.

19:46.619 --> 19:51.057
- It's the truth, isn't it?
- Yeah, I guess so.

19:51.057 --> 19:54.394
 It's like the roadrunner
 marrying the coyote.

19:54.427 --> 19:57.230
  Great! Does this mean
  I have to pay
  for my own burger?

20:02.335 --> 20:04.371
- Good evening.
- Hey.

20:04.404 --> 20:06.539
 Thanks, Max.

20:06.573 --> 20:08.141
  Thanks for coming.

20:11.144 --> 20:13.380
   So, what have you been doing
   since I've been away?

20:13.413 --> 20:15.682
The usual.
How about you?

20:15.715 --> 20:20.286
 Well,
 I've been sitting in my room
 watching <i>Brady Bunch</i> reruns.

20:20.320 --> 20:22.288
 You could always
 make me laugh, Zack.

20:22.322 --> 20:24.290
 It's a shame we don't feel
 the same way

20:24.324 --> 20:25.692
 about our family
 and children.

20:25.725 --> 20:28.595
  Maybe that's because
  I was an only child

20:28.628 --> 20:32.065
 and wanted all
 of your attention for myself.

20:32.098 --> 20:33.500
 How's our son, little Screech?

20:33.533 --> 20:34.601
Talks about
you all the time.

20:34.634 --> 20:36.169
Really?

20:41.141 --> 20:44.077
  - Thank you.
  - Hope you like
  tonight's special.

20:44.110 --> 20:46.513
It's a little surprise
Max cooked up.

20:46.546 --> 20:49.616
   So would you consider
   giving me another chance?

20:49.649 --> 20:51.618
  I'd have to think about it.

20:54.087 --> 20:55.221
   Hi, Dad.

20:56.690 --> 20:58.191
 Son.

21:00.427 --> 21:02.529
 How I've missed him.

21:04.230 --> 21:06.633
  Daddy, where are you?
  It's dark in here.

21:12.238 --> 21:14.407
  So what do you say?

21:14.441 --> 21:16.743
Will you take me back?

21:16.776 --> 21:19.346
  Give him another chance, Mom.
  I need a new bike.

21:21.114 --> 21:22.482
Well, Zack,
can you accept the fact

21:22.515 --> 21:25.685
that it's hard to be alone
when you have children?

21:25.719 --> 21:28.555
   I can do it.
   I mean, I want to do it.

21:28.588 --> 21:31.291
  Yeah, but at times
  it's nice to be alone, too.

21:34.327 --> 21:36.696
 Excuse me, time's up.

21:36.730 --> 21:38.665
 - Our project is over.
 - Hey, wait.

21:38.698 --> 21:40.700
   We're working
   on extra credit.

21:40.734 --> 21:42.335
Mr. Belding, I'm sorry,

21:42.369 --> 21:45.138
Slater and I couldn't
make our marriage work.

21:45.171 --> 21:48.341
   Jessie, sometimes two people
   just aren't compatible.

21:48.375 --> 21:50.410
   The important thing is
   that both couples

21:50.443 --> 21:53.113
  tried to communicate
  and they succeeded.

21:53.113 --> 21:55.482
I think you all learned
a lot about yourselves.

21:55.515 --> 21:57.450
  All of you pass.
  Good work.

21:57.484 --> 21:59.853
 - All right. Thanks.
 - Thank you.

21:59.886 --> 22:01.855
Zack, I have
that surprise for you.

22:01.888 --> 22:04.257
You do?

22:04.290 --> 22:07.160
 Remember in our project
 I told you
 about another child?

22:07.193 --> 22:08.495
- Mmm-hmm.
- Well, it was a girl.

22:08.528 --> 22:10.463
 A girl. That's great.

22:10.497 --> 22:11.698
Da-da!

22:21.541 --> 22:23.810
 ( instrumental music plays )
