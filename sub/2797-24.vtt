-The McPeepers 360 pro-grade binoculars.
-Ooh!

00:38.291 --> 00:39.417
Image stabilization.

Chromatic aberration prevention.

Let's do it. Time's a-wastin'.

00:51.667 --> 00:54.500
-Maybe you should let me hold those.
-What? Why?

00:54.583 --> 00:56.625
How should I put this? Hmm...

00:56.709 --> 00:59.375
You kind of break,

00:59.458 --> 01:02.083
-What are you talking about?
-Hmm...

01:13.291 --> 01:16.000
Cunningham, those McPeepers are my dad's.

01:16.083 --> 01:19.125
Which means I'm less not allowed
to touch them than you.

01:19.208 --> 01:21.959
See? Touched 'em. They're fine.

01:22.041 --> 01:25.500
(gasps, screams) I'm cursed!

01:25.583 --> 01:28.417
Now we'll never see
Lloyd Doppler's fiery death

01:28.500 --> 01:31.333

-but when you're shoobed...
-Yes. Exactly. Go!

01:43.750 --> 01:46.542
Ugh! (gasps)

01:46.625 --> 01:48.083

it broke,
I told him not to, but...

01:52.917 --> 01:54.792
You got anything for that?

01:54.875 --> 01:57.375
"A problem at a distance..."

01:57.458 --> 02:00.125

02:00.208 --> 02:02.625

02:02.709 --> 02:05.208
I look forward to figuring out

What'd it say?
What'd it say? What'd it say?

02:07.917 --> 02:10.583
A problem at a distance

02:10.667 --> 02:13.125
Oh, great, that solves absolutely nothing!

02:13.208 --> 02:14.291
Hmm.

02:16.625 --> 02:19.792
"McPeepers are guaranteed
100% unbreakable"?

02:19.875 --> 02:21.500
Wait a honkin' minute... That's it!

02:21.583 --> 02:24.917
Howard, I know how we can get
a new pair of McPeepers.

02:27.291 --> 02:29.041
You're gonna tell me, right?

02:29.125 --> 02:31.458
(McFist) Viceroy, get in here!

02:32.500 --> 02:35.333
Not sure why we even bothered
putting in an intercom.

02:35.417 --> 02:36.667
Care to explain this?

02:36.750 --> 02:39.667
(screaming)

02:39.750 --> 02:41.083
<i>H-Diz here with a "s'update."</i>

02:54.750 --> 02:56.000
(McFist screams)

02:56.083 --> 02:59.583
Why's your robot fritzing
out all over the fun, Viceroy?

02:59.667 --> 03:02.917
I said I wanted it
to lure and destroy the Ninja.

03:03.000 --> 03:05.500
You also said, "I just finished
watching a show on armadillos.

03:05.583 --> 03:07.291
Make it exactly like an armadillo."

03:07.375 --> 03:10.583
Fun fact, armadillos can hold their breath
for up to six minutes.

03:10.667 --> 03:12.542
Also, they have terrible eyesight.

03:12.625 --> 03:14.375
Oh, I'm beginning to see the problem.

03:14.458 --> 03:16.375
<i>Sir, there are two boys here</i>

03:16.458 --> 03:18.542
<i>saying they broke their McPeepers.</i>

03:18.625 --> 03:20.208
<i>They want a free pair.</i>

03:20.291 --> 03:23.333
Give 'em a free pair
of McKicks in the butt!

03:23.417 --> 03:25.250
Impossible. McPeepers don't break.

03:25.333 --> 03:27.583
I designed them specifically not to.

03:27.667 --> 03:30.291
And yet they did. Shocker.

03:30.375 --> 03:32.875
-Just take care of it.
-What about the armored-dillo?

03:32.959 --> 03:34.875
Does it look like he's going anywhere?

03:37.375 --> 03:39.542
-(squealing)
-(laughing)

03:39.625 --> 03:41.875
(sighs)

03:42.959 --> 03:45.917
This better work, Cunningham.
I am not missing Smashdown.

03:46.000 --> 03:47.625
OK. You got another idea?

03:47.709 --> 03:50.792
Of course not. (chuckles)
I'm just saying it better work.

03:50.875 --> 03:54.417
So you're the ones claiming
you broke a pair of McPeepers.

03:54.500 --> 03:57.166
Sorry, boys, but there is just no...

03:57.250 --> 04:00.458
But they're indestructible. I'll prove it.

04:04.667 --> 04:07.500
-See? Indestructible.
-Huh?

04:09.500 --> 04:11.875
Oh, boy! Totally see.

04:11.959 --> 04:14.291
Sorry, buddy. Robot on the loose.
Gotta take care of this.

04:14.375 --> 04:15.417
Indestructible.

04:15.500 --> 04:18.166
Get the new McPeeps and meet me there.

04:18.250 --> 04:22.000
McPeepers don't break. (shrieks)

04:22.083 --> 04:24.166
I've got a Smashdown to attend,

04:24.250 --> 04:26.750
so if you'll just give me
my new McPeepers,

04:26.834 --> 04:30.083
-I'll be on my way.
-You come with me now.

04:30.166 --> 04:33.083

04:46.375 --> 04:48.375
Hello. Over here.

04:51.000 --> 04:54.917
Nope. Over here. No, here.

04:55.500 --> 04:56.750
Here. How's this?

04:56.834 --> 04:58.583
Follow the sound of my voice.

05:01.125 --> 05:01.959
Oh, boy.

05:05.125 --> 05:06.208
Ninja flip!

05:07.792 --> 05:09.583
Ninja unprotected belly stab!

05:10.375 --> 05:12.667
N.J., <i>mucho grac</i> for your help.
You hanging?

05:12.750 --> 05:14.125
-What?
-Only ten minutes

05:14.208 --> 05:17.417
and they'll be writing
Lloyd Doppler's orbit-uary.

05:17.500 --> 05:19.834
(Bucky) Orbit-uary. Satellite zing.

05:19.917 --> 05:22.208
Ten minutes. Howard should be here by now.

05:22.291 --> 05:25.500
Unless he can't.
'Cause I left him at my archenemy's lair.

05:25.583 --> 05:26.792
Smoke bomb!

05:26.875 --> 05:29.375
Hey, Viceroy, what has four legs,

05:29.458 --> 05:32.458
a hard shell and is 100% useless?

05:32.542 --> 05:33.917
Your armored-dillo.

05:34.041 --> 05:37.333
Amazing. Absolutely amazing.

05:37.417 --> 05:40.625
Yep, feeling pretty good about that burn.

05:41.333 --> 05:42.625
Who's the kid?

05:43.959 --> 05:47.542
This boy is greatest
destructive force I've ever seen.

05:47.625 --> 05:50.542
Every product in there
is guaranteed indestructible.

05:50.625 --> 05:53.125
Yet, he can always find its weakness.

05:53.208 --> 05:55.542
He demolished the McPooper.

05:55.625 --> 05:58.083
Mm-hmm. Inadequate pressure valve.

05:59.458 --> 06:02.166
(humming)

06:02.250 --> 06:04.166
-Hm?
-How'd he do that?

06:04.250 --> 06:06.834
Apparently,
I over-oxidized the metal plating

06:06.917 --> 06:08.083
on the McFrying Pan.

06:08.166 --> 06:10.667
(clears throat)

06:11.917 --> 06:14.417
(screams, sighs)

06:15.500 --> 06:18.417
And under-oxidized
the plating on the McStove.

06:19.500 --> 06:20.834
(laughing)

06:23.333 --> 06:25.750
(screams)

06:25.834 --> 06:28.291
How exactly is this chowder
head burning down

06:28.375 --> 06:30.166
my building good for business?

06:30.250 --> 06:31.792
Oh, it's terrible for business.

06:31.875 --> 06:34.625
But it's great for that other thing.

06:34.709 --> 06:37.500
(laughing) The other thing.

06:37.583 --> 06:38.667
What other thing?

06:38.750 --> 06:41.500
-You know...
-Yes.

06:42.333 --> 06:43.625
No, I don't know.

06:43.709 --> 06:46.166
<i>Five minutes till smashdown.</i>

06:48.166 --> 06:51.417
(panting)
There was a kid here a minute ago.

06:51.500 --> 06:53.625
Yay big, breaks stuff.

06:53.709 --> 06:56.333
He destroyed another pair of McPeepers

06:56.417 --> 06:59.625
so Mr. Viceroy took him to the back room.

06:59.709 --> 07:00.542
The back room?

07:00.625 --> 07:03.667
Bad things always happen in back rooms.

07:04.250 --> 07:06.458
Viceroy, whatever I assume you're doing

07:06.542 --> 07:08.750
to my friend right now, you better assume

07:08.834 --> 07:11.083
that I'm assuming
I'm going to do it to you.

07:11.166 --> 07:13.959
Only worse and that's a fact.

07:15.500 --> 07:18.041
Howard, you're OK.

07:18.125 --> 07:21.083
-Better than OK. Look what I got.
-New McPeepers.

07:21.166 --> 07:23.208
New and improved.

07:23.291 --> 07:24.542
Thanks to your friend here,

07:24.625 --> 07:27.000
now they really are indestructible.

07:27.083 --> 07:28.583
Show him.

07:32.542 --> 07:34.291
Pleasure working with you, Willem.

07:34.375 --> 07:35.709
And thanks for the fresh peeps.

07:35.792 --> 07:38.583
Believe me, you earned them.

07:38.667 --> 07:41.083
(laughs, cackles)

07:41.166 --> 07:42.166
So that's weird.

07:42.250 --> 07:44.375
You shaking hands with Viceroy.

07:44.458 --> 07:46.959
Yeah, I thought
breaking things was a curse.

07:47.041 --> 07:48.375
Turns out it's a gift.

07:48.458 --> 07:50.834
I'm helping to make
high quality consumer goods.

07:50.917 --> 07:53.500
Feels nice helping people.
You should try it.

07:53.583 --> 07:55.417
Oh, that's a great idea,
maybe I will. Thanks so much.

08:05.500 --> 08:07.875
No. No. You already had Ninja o'clock.

08:07.959 --> 08:09.750
It's past Ninja o'clock.

08:09.834 --> 08:11.875
Don't worry. I'm warmed up.

08:11.959 --> 08:13.542
This won't take long.

08:20.583 --> 08:23.417
Ninja chain-sicle! Oof!

08:23.500 --> 08:25.375
Ow! How'd you see that coming?

08:26.834 --> 08:28.625
Oh, you have McPeepers
in the back of your...

08:28.709 --> 08:30.166
Wait a honkin' second! McPeepers?

08:36.750 --> 08:39.667
-Ninja stab!
- <i>Ninja stab!</i>

08:40.917 --> 08:42.333
What kind of armor is that?

08:43.166 --> 08:45.917
McFrying Pans.
Good luck stopping those, Ninja.

08:46.000 --> 08:47.834
Those are Weinerman-tested.

08:47.917 --> 08:49.583
Ninja tengu fire ball!

08:49.667 --> 08:51.542
That bot can't be broken.

08:51.625 --> 08:53.917
My best friend is gonna
be destroyed because of me.

08:54.000 --> 08:55.458
It's a curse again.

08:55.542 --> 08:58.291
The 100% McFist Product Robot.

08:58.375 --> 09:01.959
-Now 100% indestructible.
-Yes!

09:02.041 --> 09:05.750
And the Ninja will be 100% destrumbled.

09:05.834 --> 09:09.083
-Sir, "destrumbled" is not a...
-Yes, it is.

09:10.583 --> 09:13.000

09:20.917 --> 09:23.458

09:23.542 --> 09:24.542
No kidding!

09:24.625 --> 09:26.917
No, I mean it really can't be stopped.

09:27.000 --> 09:29.959
Why do I have to be so awesome
at breaking things? (screams)

09:43.000 --> 09:45.083
-This is all my fault.
-Stop shaking me.

09:45.166 --> 09:48.208
-I break everything I touch.
-Stop touching me.

(gasps) "A problem at a distance

09:55.542 --> 09:58.375
Howard, you've never met
a McFist product you can't break.

09:58.458 --> 10:00.625
There must be a way to destroy this robot.

10:00.709 --> 10:03.000
Nothing on Earth can stop it.

10:03.083 --> 10:05.166

11:02.125 --> 11:04.333
-(gunfire)
-Blam. Blam!

11:04.417 --> 11:07.333
(laughs, chokes)

11:07.417 --> 11:10.375
(imitating video game sounds)

11:10.458 --> 11:12.792
(game announcer) <i>That is no baloney,</i>
<i>you have leveled up!</i>

11:12.875 --> 11:15.417
Um, I come with a message
from the Food Hole.

11:15.500 --> 11:18.291
You're bogartin' the Mustermann,
and people are not happy.

11:18.375 --> 11:19.417
(growling)

11:19.500 --> 11:21.125
Howard, I've dropped eight hours. Blam!

11:21.208 --> 11:23.625
And two weeks allowance
into this game. Bla-blam!

11:23.709 --> 11:25.166
I'm finally about to beat it.

11:25.250 --> 11:27.667
Click. Click. Click. No. I'm out.

11:28.542 --> 11:32.792
(announcer) <i>Welcome, Baby Buckaroo.</i>
<i>He will to be your huckleberry.</i>

11:32.875 --> 11:34.959
-What are you doing?
-Saving your butt.

11:35.041 --> 11:37.125
My butt doesn't need saving.

11:39.291 --> 11:42.208
- <i>Baby Buckaroo is hero of the victory.</i>
-What the juice?

11:42.291 --> 11:44.542
By the power vested in me

11:44.625 --> 11:47.375
by the Manfred Mustermann
Kid Cowboy Committee,

11:47.458 --> 11:49.000
I hereby pronounce you,

11:49.083 --> 11:51.250
"Hero for the Day." Skee-bow!

11:51.333 --> 11:53.250
Wow! A medal.

11:53.333 --> 11:55.500
I did not plan on being a hero today.

11:55.583 --> 11:59.500
But when duty calls, you know? (laughs)

11:59.583 --> 12:02.458
-Duty.
-Just one thing, you're not a hero.

12:02.542 --> 12:04.625
Then why do I have this medal?

12:04.709 --> 12:07.750
Because you jumped in at the last second
and ganked your biffer's cheese,

12:07.834 --> 12:10.333
-Howard-style.
-What's that supposed to mean?

12:10.417 --> 12:13.834
Look, the Ninja is a hero.
You're, you know...

12:13.917 --> 12:15.458
No, I don't know.

12:15.542 --> 12:18.166
Come on, we both know. You're... you.

12:18.250 --> 12:20.375
Exactly. A hero!

12:21.458 --> 12:24.750
Clearly what we need
is some kind of hero expert.

12:24.834 --> 12:27.500
Fortunately,
I happen to have such an expert

12:27.583 --> 12:29.000
here in my satchel.

12:29.083 --> 12:31.333
Even the NinjaNomicon
will agree with me on this one

12:31.417 --> 12:33.000
because I'm right.

12:36.417 --> 12:37.667
(gasps)

12:37.750 --> 12:40.041
"A hero sacrifices all to save the day."

12:40.125 --> 12:44.000
Yes, exactly. Thanks a trills,
Nomi-Cool <i>.</i> Vloomp you later.

12:44.792 --> 12:48.542
Ha! It must kill you that even
your own book says I'm the hero.

12:48.625 --> 12:50.000
That is not what it said.

12:50.083 --> 12:53.834
I sacrificed my last token.
Day saved by me.

12:53.917 --> 12:55.917
You didn't save the day.
You saved the second.

12:56.000 --> 12:58.458
That medal should say,
"Randy does all the work while Howard

12:58.542 --> 13:00.709
jumps in at the last second
and ganks his cheese."

13:00.792 --> 13:02.875
And yet, all it says is "Hero."

13:02.959 --> 13:04.875
Medals don't lie, Cunningham.

13:04.959 --> 13:07.417
(roars) What's this, some kind of line?

13:08.250 --> 13:11.417
Let's stand in it and find out. (guffaws)

13:11.500 --> 13:14.625
-Hey, Randy.
-Oh, were you asking about my hero medal?

13:14.709 --> 13:17.458
I got it for hero-ing. I'm a hero. Hero.

13:17.542 --> 13:19.083
Not a hero.

13:20.792 --> 13:23.000
(dance music playing)

13:26.875 --> 13:29.417
How have we never heard of "Club
Super Awesome Teen Time Club"?

13:29.500 --> 13:31.333
It's every one of those words.

13:31.417 --> 13:33.125
And one of them twice.

13:33.208 --> 13:36.709
I'll bet it's exclusive.
Think of all the people who didn't get in.

13:36.792 --> 13:39.458
Cunningham and Weinerman, check.

13:39.542 --> 13:42.125
Every single person from school is here.

13:42.208 --> 13:44.667
Bucky? Why are you taking attendance?

13:44.750 --> 13:47.917
She told me to.
I didn't <i>mask</i> any questions.

13:48.792 --> 13:50.875
Mysterious hostess zing!

13:50.959 --> 13:53.834
-Ugh! I know that smell.
-Wasn't me!

13:53.917 --> 13:55.125
OK, it was me.

13:55.208 --> 13:58.583
I'm talking about her.
Rancid bologna. Old man breath.

13:58.667 --> 14:00.000
Don't tell me. Don't tell me...

14:00.083 --> 14:02.417
Students of Norrisville,

14:02.500 --> 14:05.166
I hope you're enjoying the party.

14:05.250 --> 14:06.500
(cheering)

14:06.583 --> 14:08.458
Everybody's cheering, so I'm cheering.

14:08.542 --> 14:11.917
Because it will be your last.

14:12.000 --> 14:13.709
(cackling)

14:13.792 --> 14:16.959
Wouldn't you know it?
My first party is also my last.

14:19.750 --> 14:21.834
(cackling)

14:21.917 --> 14:25.041
-(Randy) The Sorceress.
-Man, they'll let anybody in this club.

14:25.125 --> 14:28.959
You are all my prisoners.

14:29.041 --> 14:30.792
The Ninja will come for us.

14:30.875 --> 14:34.208
Oh, I believe the Ninja is already here.

14:34.959 --> 14:39.041
Now to give him a reason to show himself.

14:39.875 --> 14:41.750
(snarling)

14:43.834 --> 14:45.417
(shouting)

14:45.500 --> 14:48.291
My sister's a demon dog!

14:48.375 --> 14:50.375
I'd be lying if I said I hadn't suspected.

14:50.458 --> 14:52.959
-This calls for a hero.
-I'm on it.

14:53.041 --> 14:56.166
I mean the Ninja, not you, Baby Buckaroo.

14:56.250 --> 14:57.875
(gasps)

14:57.959 --> 15:01.959
Stay outta my way.
It's Ninja ti... Theresa.

15:02.041 --> 15:04.917
You're holding my hand.
That's quite a grip you got there.

15:05.000 --> 15:08.792
Hope you don't mind. I'm gonna hang
onto this 'cause, you know... those.

15:08.875 --> 15:10.208
(screams)

15:11.709 --> 15:14.166
Reveal yourself, Ninja.

15:14.250 --> 15:18.250
Or everyone will pay for your cowardice.

15:18.333 --> 15:21.125
Hmm. Where is that Ninja?

15:21.208 --> 15:22.792
Guess I'll have to handle this.

15:22.875 --> 15:24.083
Do not handle this. Huh?

15:25.333 --> 15:27.166
I gotta get everybody to the bathroom.

15:27.250 --> 15:29.834
Theresa, I don't suppose
you have your twirlin' sticks on you.

15:31.333 --> 15:35.000
-(grunts)
-Am I going to get this back?

15:35.083 --> 15:37.917
No. Hey, demon dogs.

15:38.625 --> 15:42.125
-Fetch!
-(snarls)

15:46.709 --> 15:49.208
-Yes, yes. Quick, everyone into the...
-Bathroom.

15:49.291 --> 15:50.959
Hi, I'm Howard,
I'll be your hero this evening.

15:51.041 --> 15:52.875
Come on, Randy, let's follow Howard.

15:54.875 --> 15:57.083
He's ganking my cheese again.

15:57.166 --> 15:59.291
-(screaming)
-(growling)

16:05.500 --> 16:06.750
(cackling)

16:08.834 --> 16:10.667
Say <i>hello</i> to our newest hero.

16:10.750 --> 16:12.542
Ninja no-show zing!

16:13.625 --> 16:16.166
Stop ganking my cheese!

16:16.250 --> 16:18.959
Stop making it so easy
to gank your cheese.

16:22.667 --> 16:24.417
(whimpering) What do we do now?

16:24.500 --> 16:27.250
Yeah, hero, what do we do now?

16:28.417 --> 16:31.542
-Through there.
-We don't know where it goes.

16:31.625 --> 16:34.667
As any real hero can tell,
it goes that way.

16:38.125 --> 16:40.625
I'm terrified of dogs and mystery doors.

16:40.709 --> 16:42.667
Not a good night for me.

16:43.750 --> 16:45.375
(Sorceress) Yes, my pets,

16:45.417 --> 16:47.458
drive them deeper

16:47.542 --> 16:50.500
to their doom. (cackles)

16:50.583 --> 16:53.750
Relax, everybody.
You're in good hands. Mine.

16:53.834 --> 16:56.959
Though they may be delicate,
they will lead you to safety.

16:57.041 --> 16:59.417
You have to distract Theresa
and Bucky so I can...

16:59.500 --> 17:00.875
So you can what, Cunningham?

17:00.959 --> 17:03.333
Finally show up and gank my cheese?

17:03.417 --> 17:05.458
You'd like that, wouldn't you?

17:05.542 --> 17:08.375
Yes. I would love that.
So would everyone else.

17:08.458 --> 17:10.792
-You have no idea where you're leading us.
-Admit it.

17:10.875 --> 17:13.709
-You have no faith in me.
-I have no faith in you.

17:13.792 --> 17:17.834
Well, I do. I'll follow you anywhere,
O hero, my hero.

17:17.917 --> 17:19.792
Wow, those are
some sweaty mitts you got there.

17:20.834 --> 17:23.542
Theresa,
I think you'd be safer with Howard.

17:23.625 --> 17:26.917
He's the... uh, real hero.

17:27.000 --> 17:30.291
I heard that.
Everybody hear that? (echoes)

17:30.375 --> 17:32.291
-Really?
-I'm afraid so.

17:32.375 --> 17:33.792
But I'll be right behind you.

17:35.417 --> 17:36.667
Stick close, people.

17:36.750 --> 17:39.959
This hero train don't stop
till we reach Safety Town.

17:40.041 --> 17:43.458
-Finally, it's Nin...
-Move it. I'm following that guy.

17:44.375 --> 17:45.542
Ninja time!

17:48.458 --> 17:52.041
Flute Dog, Weiner Dog,
Morgan Dog, let's see what you got.

17:52.959 --> 17:55.375
-(snarls)
-A little warning would have been nice.

18:00.875 --> 18:02.583
Ninja flip!

18:11.333 --> 18:13.375
Are you sure you know where you're going?

18:13.458 --> 18:16.208
You wouldn't ask the Ninja
if he knew where he was going.

18:16.291 --> 18:18.333
He usually knows where he's going.

18:19.125 --> 18:21.583
Listen up, people. I'm your hero,

18:21.667 --> 18:26.417
which means you do what I say.
And I say we're going this way.

18:26.500 --> 18:29.041
-That's a bottomless pit.
-Then we're going the other way.

18:31.166 --> 18:32.083
(grunts) Huh?

18:33.125 --> 18:35.959
-What the juice?
-(roaring)

18:36.041 --> 18:37.542
Bad dogs.

18:41.875 --> 18:43.834
Ninja stalactite snag!

18:49.875 --> 18:50.667
Hi-yah!

18:50.750 --> 18:53.625
Zone! Uh-oh.

18:54.667 --> 18:56.917
Ow! Ah...

18:58.333 --> 19:00.750
(grunts)

19:03.709 --> 19:06.000
-Who's next?
-(Sorceress) I am.

19:06.083 --> 19:07.834
Welcome to my lair.

19:07.917 --> 19:09.917
Hope you like
what I've done with the place.

19:10.000 --> 19:11.583
Little cave-y for my taste.

19:11.667 --> 19:13.375
(shrieks)

19:14.125 --> 19:15.458
(Sorceress cackling)

19:18.458 --> 19:20.083
(grunts)

19:20.625 --> 19:21.750
Ah!

19:21.834 --> 19:23.250
Hachi-machi!

19:23.333 --> 19:24.750
What the juice is that?

19:24.834 --> 19:27.625
A portal to the Land of Shadows.

19:27.709 --> 19:29.583
-The Land Of Shadows?
-(cackling)

19:29.667 --> 19:33.500
I languished there for 800 years.

19:33.583 --> 19:35.917
Now it's your turn to suffer.

19:40.542 --> 19:42.458
Darkness will be your prison,

19:42.542 --> 19:46.542
while I rule the world with the Sorcerer.

19:48.667 --> 19:50.417
-What?
-Oh, yes, I did.

19:50.500 --> 19:51.917
Ninja Sorceress surprise!

19:57.083 --> 20:00.041
(screams, winces)

20:00.125 --> 20:01.542
(laughs)

20:02.333 --> 20:04.458
I will savor your destruction.

20:04.542 --> 20:07.375
Then I will turn my wrath

20:07.458 --> 20:09.375
on those you have sworn to protect.

20:09.458 --> 20:12.125
Not gonna happen.
They're long gone by now.

20:12.208 --> 20:15.834
This is it. Right through this tunnel
is... aw, more cave?

20:15.917 --> 20:19.625
I'll destroy them first
and make you watch.

20:19.709 --> 20:20.625
(all gasp)

20:20.709 --> 20:23.125
A hero sacrifices all.

20:32.583 --> 20:35.583
(snarls)

20:35.667 --> 20:36.834
No!

20:53.291 --> 20:55.291
(grunting)

20:57.000 --> 20:59.166
-(panting)
-You saved me.

20:59.250 --> 21:00.792
Don't ever do that again.

21:00.875 --> 21:03.166
Trust me, I wasn't that into it either.

21:05.667 --> 21:08.250
(chanting) Ninja! Ninja! Ninja!

21:08.333 --> 21:09.709
Ninja saved us.

21:09.792 --> 21:11.291
And Howard saved the Ninja.

21:11.375 --> 21:13.333
-Howard! Howard...
-I was wrong.

21:13.417 --> 21:16.709
-You're a total hero.
-The important thing is

21:16.792 --> 21:19.166
-you admitted you're wrong.
-Of course, I'm a hero, too.

21:19.250 --> 21:22.083
I mean, I did banish the Sorceress
back to the Land of Shadows.

21:22.166 --> 21:24.208
Bummer they don't make a medal for that.

21:24.291 --> 21:27.709
Oh! I lost my medal
in the Land of Shadows.

21:27.792 --> 21:29.208
I'm gonna follow the Ninja home.

21:29.291 --> 21:32.166
No, Bash. This hero will show you the way.

21:32.250 --> 21:35.291
-What about Randy?
-I'm sure we'll find him

21:35.375 --> 21:37.583
crying in some tunnel on the way out.

21:37.667 --> 21:39.291
Which is this way.

21:39.375 --> 21:41.375
-Other way.
-Other way!

21:41.458 --> 21:43.417
-(all groan)
-(Ninja laughs)

21:43.500 --> 21:45.583
Ahh... smoke bomb.

21:48.166 --> 21:50.458
(theme music plays)
