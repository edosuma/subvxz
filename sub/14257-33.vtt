TODAY IT IS MY PLEASURE
TO INTERVIEW

01:11.695 --> 01:15.968
AGATHA MARBLES,
WORLD-FAMOUS SLEUTH
AND CRIME-SOLVER,

01:15.969 --> 01:17.738
AND MY FAVORITE AUNT.

01:17.739 --> 01:19.674
WHY, THANK YOU, APRIL.

01:24.483 --> 01:26.585
CUT! CUT!

01:26.586 --> 01:28.924
MR. THOMPSON,
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

01:28.925 --> 01:31.595
WHAT IDIOT DROPPED
THIS ON THE FLOOR?

01:31.596 --> 01:34.766
APRIL, WHAT'S
YOUR AUNT DOING?

01:34.767 --> 01:38.072
WHAT SHE DOES BEST,
VERNON--
FINDING CLUES.

01:38.073 --> 01:40.643
HMM, THE ANGLE
OF THE BITE

01:40.644 --> 01:42.814
WOULD INDICATE
THE PERPETRATOR

01:42.815 --> 01:45.684
TO BE ABOUT
5'9" IN HEIGHT

01:45.685 --> 01:48.188
AND A SLOPPY EATER.

01:48.189 --> 01:50.192
HMM, WHAT
HAVE WE HERE?

01:50.193 --> 01:53.799
WHY, I DO BELIEVE
IT'S A FRAGMENT
OF BANANA.

01:53.800 --> 01:55.768
IT--IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.

01:55.769 --> 01:57.705
I WAS GOING TO PUT IT
IN THE TRASH

01:57.706 --> 02:00.376
WHEN IT--IT SQUIRTED
OUT OF MY HAND.

02:00.377 --> 02:02.079
CASED CLOSED,
MR. THOMPSON.

02:02.080 --> 02:03.615
HERE'S YOUR IDIOT.

02:03.616 --> 02:05.618
OH, VERNON,
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE

02:05.619 --> 02:08.023
A LITTLE CHITCHAT
ABOUT LITTERING.

02:09.292 --> 02:11.662
THAT'S ONE INTERVIEW

02:11.663 --> 02:13.465
VERNON WON'T FORGET
FOR A WHILE.

02:13.466 --> 02:15.001
SPEAKING OF INTERVIEWS,

02:15.002 --> 02:16.303
WHEN DO I GET TO MEET

02:16.304 --> 02:19.642
THE LEGENDARY
TEENAGE MUTANT
NINJA TURTLES?

02:19.643 --> 02:21.444
WHY, AUNT AGGIE!

02:21.445 --> 02:24.016
HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT
I KNOW THE TURTLES?

02:24.017 --> 02:26.019
ELEMENTARY,
MY DEAR APRIL.

02:26.020 --> 02:29.793
FIRST, YOU DEVELOPED
A TASTE FOR BIZARRE
PIZZA TOPPINGS.

02:29.794 --> 02:32.330
YOU'VE ALSO BECOME
AN OUTSPOKEN ADVOCATE

02:32.331 --> 02:34.400
OF TURTLE RIGHTS.

02:34.401 --> 02:38.039
AND NOW WE FIND A BIT
OF SLIMOSIS SEWEROTTA,

02:38.040 --> 02:41.346
BETTER KNOWN
AS SEWER SLIME,
ON YOUR SHOE, DEAR.

02:41.347 --> 02:43.716
YOU GOT ME,
AUNT AGGIE.

02:43.717 --> 02:47.055
COME ON, LET'S GO
SEE THE GREEN TEENS.

02:47.056 --> 02:50.460
OK, GOT THE PIZZAS.

02:50.461 --> 02:52.363
NOW WE PICK UP
MASTER SPLINTER'S
KIMONO AT--

02:53.566 --> 02:55.035
THE QUICK KIMONO CLEANERS.

02:55.036 --> 02:57.406
TIME TO AMSCRAY,
BRUCE.

02:57.407 --> 02:59.142
RIGHT BEHIND YOU,
RODNEY.

03:00.679 --> 03:02.047
SOMEBODY STOP THEM!

03:02.048 --> 03:04.350
THEY'VE STOLEN
ALL THE KIMONOS!

03:04.351 --> 03:05.853
OH, NO.

03:05.854 --> 03:08.357
THEY'VE GOT MASTER
SPLINTER'S KIMONO.

03:08.358 --> 03:09.660
BUT NOT FOR LONG.

03:11.530 --> 03:14.902
BLAH. BUTTERSCOTCH
AND ONIONS.

03:14.903 --> 03:17.206
YUCK.
WITH ANCHOVIES.

03:17.207 --> 03:20.377
WHAT A WASTE
OF FANTABULOSO FOOD.

03:20.378 --> 03:21.880
I CAN'T WATCH.

03:21.881 --> 03:24.885
UH, ENOUGH
IS TOO MUCH ALREADY.

03:24.886 --> 03:26.822
LET'S TAKE A POWDER.

03:31.564 --> 03:33.768
THE BOSS IS GONNA
BE PLENTY HOT.

03:33.769 --> 03:36.739
WE ONLY GOT
ONE LOUSY KIMONO.

03:36.740 --> 03:38.808
MEGA DISASTER, DUDE.

03:38.809 --> 03:41.747
WE SAVED ALL THE
KIMONOS EXCEPT ONE.

03:41.748 --> 03:44.651
RIGHT.
MASTER SPLINTER'S.

03:44.652 --> 03:46.288
IT IS AN HONOR

03:46.289 --> 03:48.625
TO MEET THE GREATEST
DETECTIVE IN THE WORLD,

03:48.626 --> 03:50.128
MISS MARBLES.

03:50.129 --> 03:52.565
OH, PLEASE,
EXCUSE MY APPEARANCE,

03:52.566 --> 03:54.802
BUT MY KIMONO
IS OUT BEING CLEANED.

03:54.803 --> 03:57.974
YOU FLATTER ME,
MR. SPLINTER.

03:57.975 --> 03:59.643
NO, NOT MISTER.

03:59.644 --> 04:02.648
PLEASE, JUST
CALL ME MASTER.

04:02.649 --> 04:05.320
SO, WHAT'S IT LIKE
HAVING THE WORLD'S
GREATEST GUMSHOE

04:05.321 --> 04:06.489
FOR AN AUNT?

04:06.490 --> 04:09.027
FASCINATING.
JUST WATCH.

04:09.028 --> 04:11.698
HMM. A PIZZA CRUST...

04:13.502 --> 04:16.471
TOPPED WITH A VERY
UNHEALTHY COMBINATION

04:16.473 --> 04:18.509
OF CHOCOLATE FUDGE,

04:18.510 --> 04:20.245
PEANUTS, AND BEAN SPROUTS.

04:20.247 --> 04:23.184
FUNNY, I THOUGHT
BEAN SPROUTS
WERE GOOD FOR YOU.

04:23.185 --> 04:24.686
AND, JUDGING
FROM THE WEIGHT

04:24.687 --> 04:26.356
OF THIS
DEHYDRATED CRUST,

04:26.357 --> 04:28.359
IT'S BEEN LYING
ON THE FLOOR

04:28.360 --> 04:29.861
FOR 3 WHOLE WEEKS.

04:29.862 --> 04:32.699
WOW.
THAT'S UNBELIEVABLE.

04:32.700 --> 04:35.070
NOT TO MENTION
UNSANITARY.

04:35.071 --> 04:38.510
HEY, DUDES,
BIG TROUBLE IN SEWER CITY.

04:38.511 --> 04:41.514
MASTER SPLINTER,
A COUPLE OF GOONS

04:41.515 --> 04:43.384
JUST STOLE YOUR KIMONO.

04:43.385 --> 04:46.055
THIS IS MOST
DISTRESSING.

04:46.056 --> 04:49.194
THAT KIMONO
WAS MY MOST
PRIZED POSSESSION.

04:49.195 --> 04:52.266
DON'T SWEAT IT, SENSEI.
WE'LL GET IT BACK...

04:52.267 --> 04:53.936
UH, SOMEHOW.

04:53.937 --> 04:55.772
HE'S RIGHT,
AND WE'LL DO IT

04:55.773 --> 04:58.243
WITH A LITTLE
OLD-FASHIONED
DETECTIVE WORK.

04:58.244 --> 05:00.079
A HOT KIMONO?

05:00.080 --> 05:02.850
WHAT MAKES ME THINK
THIS IS THE START
OF SOMETHING WACKY?

05:05.155 --> 05:09.295
I TOLD YOU MUGS TO SWIPE
EVERY KIMONO IN TOWN.

05:09.296 --> 05:11.132
SO, HOW COME YOU
ONLY COPPED ONE?

05:11.133 --> 05:12.900
WELL, YOU SEE, BOSS,

05:12.901 --> 05:15.605
THERE WERE THESE FUNNY GREEN
GUYS IN TRENCH COATS.

05:15.606 --> 05:18.944
I DON'T CARE ABOUT
NO FUNNY GREEN GUYS.

05:18.945 --> 05:21.315
ALL I CARE ABOUT
IS KIMONOS.

05:21.316 --> 05:24.654
BUT USED KIMONOS
AIN'T WORTH NOTHING.

05:24.655 --> 05:26.991
YEAH, WHAT DO YOU
WANT THEM FOR?

05:26.992 --> 05:29.796
MAKES NO NEVERMIND
WHY I WANT THEM.

05:29.797 --> 05:31.465
YOU JUST DO WHAT I SAY!

05:31.466 --> 05:33.803
AND I SAY GO BACK
TO THAT KIMONO CLEANERS,

05:33.804 --> 05:35.138
AND CLEAN IT OUT!

05:35.139 --> 05:37.141
YOU'RE THE BOSS,
BOSS.

05:37.142 --> 05:39.812
THE PUZZLING THING,
OF COURSE,

05:39.813 --> 05:41.983
IS WHY THESE THIEVES
ARE STEALING KIMONOS

05:41.984 --> 05:43.319
IN THE FIRST PLACE?

05:43.320 --> 05:46.390
NOT MUCH CHANCE
WE'LL EVER FIND OUT,
AUNT AGGIE.

05:46.391 --> 05:48.193
THOSE CROOKS
ARE MILES AWAY BY--

05:50.466 --> 05:53.670
OH, NO, IT'S THOSE
SAME GREEN GUYS.

05:53.671 --> 05:56.139
OH, NO.
IT'S THOSE SAME CROOKS.

05:56.140 --> 05:59.613
OH, NO, AND WE'RE
FRESH OUT OF PIZZAS!

06:01.250 --> 06:04.087
STOP, YOU CRUMMY
KIMONO-NAPPERS!

06:04.088 --> 06:05.723
THEY'RE ON OUR TAIL.

06:05.724 --> 06:07.392
YEAH? NOW THEY'RE
GONNA BE

06:07.393 --> 06:08.861
<i>ON THEIR TAILS.</i>

06:15.541 --> 06:17.376
THEY GOT
AWAY AGAIN.

06:17.377 --> 06:20.314
BUT THIS TIME
THEY LEFT A CLUE,

06:20.315 --> 06:23.653
THE OIL THEY USED
TO GIVE YOU TURTLES
THE SLIP.

06:23.654 --> 06:26.258
I'LL DO THE JOKES,
IF YOU DON'T MIND.

06:26.259 --> 06:27.926
GOOD THINKING,
AUNT AGGIE.

06:27.927 --> 06:30.064
LET'S GET
THAT FINGER BACK
TO THE LAB

06:30.065 --> 06:31.434
AND ANALYZE IT.

06:31.435 --> 06:33.270
AND I'LL WARN
THE ENTIRE CITY

06:33.271 --> 06:35.774
ABOUT THIS
KIMONO CRIME WAVE.

06:35.775 --> 06:38.144
THIS IS APRIL O'NEIL
REPORTING LIVE

06:38.145 --> 06:40.081
FROM THE QUICK
KIMONO CLEANERS,

06:40.082 --> 06:44.254
<i>WHERE A VICIOUS GANG
JUST PULLED ANOTHER
AUDACIOUS KIMONO HEIST.</i>

06:44.255 --> 06:45.757
DID YOU HEAR THAT?

06:45.758 --> 06:47.961
SHE SAID WE WAS AUDACIOUS.

06:47.962 --> 06:49.464
WHAT'S THAT MEAN?

06:49.465 --> 06:51.199
IT MEANS DARING.

06:51.200 --> 06:52.535
SHUT UP, YOU TWO!

06:52.536 --> 06:53.771
I WANT TO HEAR THIS!

06:53.772 --> 06:57.142
<i>A SPECIAL INVESTIGATION
IS CURRENTLY UNDERWAY.</i>

06:57.143 --> 06:59.647
<i>MEANWHILE, ALL CITIZENS
ARE WARNED</i>

06:59.648 --> 07:02.084
<i>TO KEEP A CLOSE WATCH
ON THEIR KIMONOS.</i>

07:02.085 --> 07:05.290
WHAT'S A SPECIAL
INVESTIGATION MEAN?

07:05.291 --> 07:07.427
"AUDACIOUS" HE KNOWS.

07:07.428 --> 07:09.564
"INVESTIGATION" HE DON'T.

07:09.565 --> 07:11.967
IT MEANS THAT DAME
KNOWS SOMETHING!

07:11.968 --> 07:13.136
BRING HER IN.

07:13.137 --> 07:14.672
WHAT FOR, BOSS?

07:14.673 --> 07:17.644
OH, JUST FOR LAUGHS.

07:21.051 --> 07:22.319
SORRY, GUYS,

07:22.320 --> 07:25.191
ANALYZING THIS OIL
MAY BE TOUGHER
THAN I THOUGHT.

07:25.192 --> 07:27.760
LEONARDO HERE.
WHAT'S HAPPENING, APRIL?

07:27.761 --> 07:30.332
<i>I'VE GOT A HOT LEAD. 
AN INFORMANT SAYS</i>

07:30.333 --> 07:32.536
<i>HE KNOWS WHERE
THE STOLEN KIMONOS ARE.</i>

07:32.537 --> 07:35.408
<i>WE'RE GOING TO MEET HIM
AT THE WAREHOUSE
ON ELM STREET.</i>

07:35.409 --> 07:37.210
DID YOU SAY WE?

07:37.211 --> 07:39.581
<i>YES. VERNON'S
COMING WITH ME.</i>

07:39.582 --> 07:40.982
BE CAREFUL.

07:40.983 --> 07:42.786
YEAH,
WITH VERNON AROUND,

07:42.787 --> 07:44.456
YOU NEVER KNOW
WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN.

07:44.457 --> 07:46.659
I'VE TRIED EVERY
TEST THERE IS,

07:46.660 --> 07:49.097
BUT I JUST CAN'T
ANALYZE THIS OIL.

07:49.098 --> 07:51.568
PERHAPS I MAY
BE OF SERVICE.

07:51.569 --> 07:54.440
SOMETIMES HUMAN
SENSES ARE MORE PRECISE

07:54.441 --> 07:56.142
THAN ELECTRONIC ONES.

07:56.143 --> 07:58.646
QUITE WELL PUT,
MISS MARBLES.

07:58.647 --> 07:59.915
IF YOU'LL PERMIT ME.

08:06.994 --> 08:10.934
MMM.
JUST AS I SUSPECTED.

08:10.935 --> 08:14.306
OH, YUCK! HOW CAN
YOU EAT THAT STUFF,
AUNT AGGIE?

08:14.307 --> 08:17.612
YEAH, IT'S NOT
EVEN ON A PIZZA.

08:17.613 --> 08:20.483
THIS IS A VERY RARE
OLIVE OIL,

08:20.484 --> 08:23.355
AND IT COMES FROM
ONLY ONE PLACE--

08:23.356 --> 08:25.392
THE ISLAND OF TORTELLI.

08:25.393 --> 08:27.762
HMM. THAT'S
A COINCIDENCE.

08:27.763 --> 08:29.432
THE ONLY PLACE
IN THE CITY

08:29.433 --> 08:32.102
WHERE TORTELLI
OLIVE OIL
IS SHIPPED TO

08:32.104 --> 08:34.240
IS A WAREHOUSE
ON ELM STREET.

08:34.241 --> 08:36.210
THAT'S WHERE
APRIL AND VERNON
ARE HEADED.

08:36.211 --> 08:38.948
AND I HAVE
A FEELING IT'S
RIGHT INTO A TRAP!

08:38.948 --> 08:40.450
LEONARDO TO APRIL.

08:40.451 --> 08:42.453
<i>COME IN, APRIL.</i>

08:42.455 --> 08:44.791
<i>DO YOU READ ME?</i>

08:44.792 --> 08:47.863
<i>APRIL? APRIL!</i>

08:58.347 --> 09:00.017
LOOK AT THIS--

09:00.018 --> 09:02.822
APRIL'S TURTLE COM
AND VERNON'S CAMCORDER.

09:02.823 --> 09:05.625
BUT NO APRIL
OR VERNON.

09:05.626 --> 09:07.229
I'M THINKING THAT
MAYBE

09:07.230 --> 09:09.299
THE KIMONO CREEPS
GRABBED THEM.

09:09.300 --> 09:11.169
EASY, MICHELANGELO,

09:11.170 --> 09:13.306
YOU'LL STRIP THE GEARS
IN YOUR BRAIN BOX.

09:13.307 --> 09:14.875
ENOUGH SPECULATING,
GENTLEMEN.

09:14.876 --> 09:17.279
IF WE'RE TO LOCATE
THE VILLAIN'S HIDEOUT,

09:17.280 --> 09:19.650
WE MUST FIRST FIND
THE RIGHT CLUE,

09:19.651 --> 09:22.288
AND I SUGGEST
WE START LOOKING.

09:24.057 --> 09:27.129
OK, LITTLE LADY,
SING.

09:27.130 --> 09:29.900
TELL ME
ALL YOU KNOW
ABOUT KIMONOS.

09:29.901 --> 09:31.736
NEVER, YOU CROOK!

09:31.737 --> 09:33.774
UH, APRIL,
COULDN'T YOU

09:33.775 --> 09:35.810
MAYBE TELL HIM
A LITTLE SOMETHING?

09:35.811 --> 09:38.448
NOT IN A MILLION YEARS.

09:38.449 --> 09:41.219
OK, LADY,

09:41.220 --> 09:42.722
YOU HAD YOUR CHANCE.

09:42.723 --> 09:45.493
NOW PAY THE PENALTY!

09:45.494 --> 09:48.298
FORGET IT!

09:49.902 --> 09:53.473
I WON'T TALK,
YOU FIEND!

09:56.680 --> 09:59.584
IT'S NO GOOD, BOSS,
SHE'LL NEVER BREAK.

09:59.585 --> 10:01.019
SHE'S TOO TOUGH.

10:01.020 --> 10:05.026
MAYBE, BUT THIS WIMP
SHOULD FOLD FAST.

10:05.027 --> 10:07.030
HA! NO MORE, PLEASE!

10:10.036 --> 10:12.973
I'LL TELL YOU
EVERYTHING!

10:12.974 --> 10:15.878
GOOD. NOW TALK.

10:19.952 --> 10:22.923
LISTEN TO
THAT GUY LAUGH.

10:22.924 --> 10:24.626
YEAH, AND EVERYBODY

10:24.627 --> 10:27.297
SAYS THE BOSS AIN'T
GOT NO SENSE OF HUMOR.

10:27.298 --> 10:29.634
ANY CLUES,
AUNT AGGIE?

10:29.635 --> 10:31.470
NOTHING, I'M AFRAID.

10:31.471 --> 10:33.307
NOT A THING.

10:33.308 --> 10:34.643
I CERTAINLY HAVE NO IDEA

10:34.644 --> 10:37.347
WHERE THOSE CROOKS HAVE
TAKEN APRIL AND VERNON.

10:37.348 --> 10:39.318
DUDES, WE'RE, LIKE,

10:39.319 --> 10:41.254
UP THE SEWER
WITHOUT A PADDLE.

10:41.255 --> 10:43.157
WHOA. HOWEVER,

10:43.158 --> 10:45.794
IF WE CAN'T FIND
THE KIMONO THIEVES,

10:45.795 --> 10:48.933
PERHAPS WE CAN MAKE THEM
FIND US.

10:48.934 --> 10:52.573
AMAZING. THAT'S EXACTLY
WHAT I WAS THINKING.

10:52.574 --> 10:55.711
I'LL TALK!

10:55.712 --> 10:57.180
I'LL SPILL
MY GUTS!

10:57.181 --> 10:58.849
AND IN THE THIRD GRADE...

11:00.186 --> 11:02.924
I CHEATED ON
AN ENGLISH TEST!

11:02.925 --> 11:04.693
AND LATER...

11:04.694 --> 11:07.131
I CHEATED
ON MY INCOME TAX!

11:07.132 --> 11:08.867
THIS IS HOPELESS.

11:08.868 --> 11:10.536
I'M WASTING MY TIME.

11:10.537 --> 11:12.907
HEY, BOSS.
COME SEE THIS.

11:14.644 --> 11:16.046
GREAT WORK, VERNON.

11:16.047 --> 11:18.082
HE'S COMPLETELY
WORN DOWN.

11:18.083 --> 11:21.222
OH. ME, TOO.

11:22.391 --> 11:24.460
WHAT'S GOING ON?

11:24.461 --> 11:26.998
JUST TAKE
A GANDER, BOSS.

11:26.999 --> 11:29.402
<i>¶ KIMONO KAL,
HE'S YOUR PAL ¶</i>

11:29.403 --> 11:32.540
<i>¶ SO KIMONO DOWN
TO KIMONO KAL ¶</i>

11:32.541 --> 11:34.243
<i>THAT'S RIGHT, PARTNERS.</i>

11:34.244 --> 11:37.382
<i>I'M KIMONO KAL,
AND I'M YOUR PAL.</i>

11:37.383 --> 11:38.918
<i>HERE AT THE GRAND OPENING</i>

11:38.919 --> 11:41.555
<i>OF KAL'S KLASSY
KIMONO STORE.</i>

11:41.556 --> 11:43.259
DID HE SAY KIMONOS?

11:43.260 --> 11:44.861
<i>YES, I SAID KIMONOS,</i>

11:44.862 --> 11:46.931
<i>SO COME ON DOWN.</i>

11:46.932 --> 11:48.333
<i>IF WE CAN'T MAKE A DEAL,</i>

11:48.334 --> 11:50.604
<i>I'LL EAT A SILKWORM.</i>

11:50.605 --> 11:52.607
<i>¶ KIMONO KAL IS YOUR PAL ¶</i>

11:52.608 --> 11:56.181
<i>¶ SO KIMONO DOWN
TO KIMONO KAL'S ¶</i>

11:56.182 --> 11:57.282
DID YOU HEAR THAT?

11:57.283 --> 11:59.485
GET OVER TO THAT JOINT
AND CLEAN IT OUT.

11:59.486 --> 12:01.055
RIGHT, BOSS.

12:02.325 --> 12:04.727
AH. THAT'S HARD WORK.

12:07.533 --> 12:10.939
YOU WERE MOST
CONVINCING, DONATELLO.

12:10.940 --> 12:13.744
YEAH. I'D BUY
A USED KIMONO
FROM YOU ANY DAY.

12:13.745 --> 12:16.481
UH, ABOUT THOSE SILKWORMS,

12:16.482 --> 12:18.518
COULD I GET THEM
ON A PIZZA TO GO?

12:18.519 --> 12:20.020
YOU CONVINCED US,

12:20.021 --> 12:21.990
BUT WILL THE CROOKS
BUY IT?

12:21.991 --> 12:23.493
DON'T WORRY.

12:23.494 --> 12:26.030
THEY WON'T BE ABLE
TO RESIST THIS.

12:26.031 --> 12:28.602
THERE HE IS--
KIMONO KAL.

12:30.172 --> 12:32.174
WHITE KIMONOS,
RED KIMONOS,

12:32.175 --> 12:34.044
BLACK AND BLUE KIMONOS.

12:34.045 --> 12:35.681
YOU NAME IT, I GOT IT.

12:35.682 --> 12:37.016
WRONG, BUSTER.

12:37.017 --> 12:38.619
WE GOT IT.

12:38.620 --> 12:40.355
AND WE WANT EVERY KIMONO

12:40.356 --> 12:43.160
IN THE JOINT RIGHT NOW.

12:43.161 --> 12:44.528
NOW, REMEMBER, TURTLES,

12:44.529 --> 12:47.467
DONATELLO AND I
WILL BE FOLLOWING YOU.

12:47.468 --> 12:50.938
WELL, THESE ARE ALL
THE KIMONOS I HAVE LEFT--

12:50.939 --> 12:52.641
RIGHT HERE IN THIS CRATE.

12:54.045 --> 12:57.617
HEY, THESE KIMONOS
ARE HEAVY.

12:57.618 --> 13:00.054
QUIT GRIPING
AND GET GOING.

13:01.224 --> 13:03.827
YOUR PLAN'S WORKING,
AUNT AGGIE.

13:03.828 --> 13:06.866
RIGHT, THE RATS
HAVE TAKEN THE BAIT.

13:06.867 --> 13:08.502
ONE AND 2.

13:12.076 --> 13:15.280
AND PEOPLE WONDER
WHY I LOVE THIS JOB.

13:16.616 --> 13:18.986
THE GAME IS AFOOT!
AFTER THEM!

13:24.163 --> 13:27.901
HEY, BOSS, OPEN UP.
WE GOT THE KIMONOS.

13:27.902 --> 13:30.539
IT'S ABOUT TIME
YOU GOT HERE.

13:30.540 --> 13:33.043
QUICK, VERNON.
THE DON'S GONE.

13:33.044 --> 13:34.145
LET'S MAKE
A BREAK FOR IT!

13:34.146 --> 13:37.317
NO, THANK YOU.
I'M STAYING RIGHT HERE.

13:37.318 --> 13:40.889
WHERE DON TORTELLI
CAN KEEP TICKLING
YOUR TOES?

13:40.890 --> 13:43.227
ON SECOND THOUGHT,
LET'S GET OUT OF HERE!

13:45.064 --> 13:48.068
WAIT TILL YOU
SEE THESE, BOSS.

13:50.441 --> 13:52.142
GREEN GUYS?

13:52.143 --> 13:54.313
YOU BROUGHT ME
A BUNCH OF GREEN GUYS?

13:54.314 --> 13:56.750
THE TEENAGE MUTANT
NINJA TURTLES,

13:56.751 --> 13:58.218
TO BE EXACT.

13:58.219 --> 14:00.222
AND AGATHA MARBLES,

14:00.223 --> 14:01.992
DETECTIVE EXTRAORDINAIRE,

14:01.993 --> 14:03.595
AT YOUR SERVICE.

14:03.596 --> 14:05.697
I DON'T CARE IF IT'S
NINJA NUT CAKES

14:05.698 --> 14:07.166
AND THE QUEEN OF SHEBA,

14:07.167 --> 14:08.737
CLEAR OUT OF HERE,
ALL OF YOU.

14:08.738 --> 14:12.042
NOT UNTIL
YOU RELEASE MY NIECE
AND HER COMPANION.

14:12.043 --> 14:14.947
AND RETURN MASTER
SPLINTER'S KIMONO.

14:14.948 --> 14:17.786
FORGET IT! DON TORTELLI
DON'T RETURN NOTHING,

14:17.787 --> 14:19.789
NOT EVEN LIBRARY BOOKS.

14:19.790 --> 14:21.291
RODNEY, BRUCE,

14:21.292 --> 14:23.060
STOMP THOSE LOSERS.

14:23.061 --> 14:25.799
ONE STOMPING
COMING RIGHT UP.

14:25.800 --> 14:29.205
THIS IS GONNA BE
A PIECE OF CAKE.

14:32.178 --> 14:34.514
I THINK WE DID
SOMETHING WRONG.

14:34.515 --> 14:36.283
YOU DON'T SAY.

14:36.284 --> 14:37.552
NOW, DON TORTELLI,

14:37.553 --> 14:39.890
YOU'RE ABOUT TO GET
TURTLE WAXED.

14:39.891 --> 14:42.025
OH, NO,
IT'S APRIL AND VERNON.

14:42.026 --> 14:43.629
THEY'RE OUT ON THE LEDGE.

14:43.630 --> 14:46.400
VERNON,
ARE YOU SURE
THIS IS THE WAY OUT?

14:46.401 --> 14:47.769
TRUST ME, APRIL.

14:47.770 --> 14:49.873
I HAVE THE INSTINCTS
OF A JUNGLE CAT.

14:49.874 --> 14:52.811
THEY HAVE NO IDEA
WHERE THEY ARE.

14:52.812 --> 14:55.816
TALK ABOUT THE BLINDFOLDED
LEADING THE BLINDFOLDED.

14:55.817 --> 14:57.686
WE'D BETTER
FOLLOW THEM.

14:57.687 --> 14:59.622
NOW, COME ON, YOU BOZOS.

14:59.623 --> 15:01.057
LET'S BLOW THIS PLACE.

15:03.129 --> 15:05.432
APRIL, VERNON,

15:05.433 --> 15:07.235
CAN WE TALK?

15:07.236 --> 15:08.270
WHO'S THERE?

15:08.271 --> 15:10.341
LEONARDO, IS THAT YOU?

15:10.342 --> 15:12.077
I CAN'T SEE.

15:12.078 --> 15:13.580
HOW'S THIS?

15:13.581 --> 15:15.415
OH, THAT'S BETTER.

15:15.416 --> 15:17.753
AND THAT'S WORSE!

15:17.754 --> 15:19.956
APRIL, WHAT ARE YOU
BABBLING ABOUT?

15:19.957 --> 15:21.125
THIS.

15:22.762 --> 15:24.732
LOOK OUT!

15:24.733 --> 15:26.868
OH, NO!

15:26.869 --> 15:29.473
OH, NO! DISASTER CITY!

15:29.474 --> 15:31.242
I CAN'T LOOK!

15:35.717 --> 15:38.220
HELP!

15:40.893 --> 15:43.028
WHERE ARE THEY?

15:43.029 --> 15:46.167
WELL, LIKE,
MAYBE WE BEAT THEM DOWN?

15:46.168 --> 15:49.507
RIGHT. WHAT DO YOU THINK
THIS IS, A CARTOON?

15:49.508 --> 15:51.109
WILL YOU GUYS
HELP US DOWN?

15:51.110 --> 15:52.979
THIS AWNING
BROKE OUR FALL.

15:52.980 --> 15:55.283
WE'RE LUCKY THAT'S ALL
THAT GOT BROKEN.

15:55.284 --> 15:58.121
OH, THANK GOODNESS
YOU'RE ALL RIGHT.

15:58.122 --> 16:00.058
NOW,
LET'S GET BACK UP

16:00.059 --> 16:02.094
TO DON TORTELLI'S
PENTHOUSE

16:02.095 --> 16:03.864
AND LOOK FOR CLUES.

16:03.865 --> 16:06.034
WE GOTTA
FIND THE CROOKS

16:06.035 --> 16:07.904
AND ALL THOSE
STOLEN KIMONOS.

16:07.905 --> 16:10.809
ESPECIALLY MASTER
SPLINTER'S KIMONO.

16:10.810 --> 16:13.079
WHAT'S THAT,
MICHELANGELO?

16:13.080 --> 16:14.682
JUST SOME TRASH.

16:14.683 --> 16:16.485
OH, YOU NEVER KNOW.

16:16.486 --> 16:18.389
WHAT LOOKS LIKE TRASH

16:18.390 --> 16:19.891
TO THE UNTRAINED EYE

16:19.892 --> 16:21.661
IS OFTEN A VITAL CLUE.

16:21.662 --> 16:24.733
"SHIPPING HIGH
AT 77"?

16:24.734 --> 16:26.102
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

16:26.103 --> 16:27.738
IT'S NAUTICAL TALK, DEAR.

16:27.739 --> 16:30.943
SHIPPING HIGH MEANS
TO SAIL AT HIGH TIDE.

16:30.944 --> 16:33.080
AND HIGH TIDE
MEANS THE CROOKS

16:33.081 --> 16:34.816
ARE AT THE HARBOR
RIGHT NOW.

16:34.817 --> 16:36.318
WELL, LET'S GO.

16:36.319 --> 16:38.355
WHAT ARE WE
WAITING FOR?

16:39.859 --> 16:42.896
THIS PLACE
IS HUMONGOUS.

16:42.897 --> 16:45.000
LIKE, WHERE DO
WE START LOOKING?

16:45.001 --> 16:47.605
I SUGGEST WE START
WITH THE FREIGHTER

16:47.606 --> 16:49.507
DOCKED AT PIER 77.

16:49.508 --> 16:50.877
OF COURSE.

16:50.878 --> 16:53.280
"SHIPPING HIGH
AT 77."

16:53.281 --> 16:55.017
PIER 77!

16:55.018 --> 16:56.786
BOY, HOW DID YOU
FIGURE THAT OUT,

16:56.787 --> 16:58.089
AUNT AGGIE?

16:58.090 --> 17:00.426
ELEMENTARY,
MY DEAR DONATELLO.

17:00.427 --> 17:02.796
BESIDES, I
SAW THE ENTIRE GANG

17:02.797 --> 17:04.266
STANDING OVER THERE.

17:04.267 --> 17:07.238
THAT'S THE LAST
OF THEM, BOSS.

17:07.239 --> 17:09.540
GOOD. PULL UP THE ANCHOR
AND START THE ENGINES.

17:09.541 --> 17:11.578
LET'S SHOVE OFF.

17:11.579 --> 17:13.949
OH, NO.
THEY'RE LEAVING.

17:13.950 --> 17:15.252
WE'VE GOT
TO STOP THEM.

17:15.252 --> 17:16.654
DON'T WORRY.

17:16.655 --> 17:19.223
WE'LL THROW A MONKEY WRENCH
INTO THEIR PLANS.

17:19.224 --> 17:20.992
IF SHE PULLS ONE
OF THOSE OUT
OF HER PURSE,

17:20.993 --> 17:22.295
I'M OUTTA HERE.

17:22.296 --> 17:24.633
TURTLE TEAM ONE
IN POSITION.

17:24.634 --> 17:27.105
TURTLE TEAM 2
IN POSITION.

17:27.106 --> 17:29.608
TURTLE TEAM 3
ON OUR WAY.

17:33.917 --> 17:36.520
LOOK, AUNT AGGIE.

17:36.521 --> 17:39.659
WE JUST FOUND
SPLINTER'S KIMONO.

17:39.660 --> 17:41.996
HEY, WHAT ARE
YOU DOING HERE?

17:41.997 --> 17:43.765
I RECOGNIZE THOSE TWO.

17:43.766 --> 17:46.236
IT'S THE NEWS DAME
AND THAT SNOOPY OLD LADY.

17:46.237 --> 17:47.840
LET'S GET THEM.

17:47.841 --> 17:50.377
MY, WHAT
NICE-LOOKING SAILORS.

17:50.378 --> 17:53.014
LET'S TAKE
THEIR PICTURE, APRIL.

17:53.015 --> 17:54.216
GOOD IDEA.

17:54.217 --> 17:56.620
SAY CHEESE,
YOU CHEESE BALLS.

17:58.425 --> 18:00.527
WHOA. I CAN'T SEE.

18:00.528 --> 18:01.997
ME, NEITHER.

18:01.998 --> 18:04.869
RUN FOR IT,
AUNT AGGIE!

18:04.870 --> 18:08.240
TURTLES, WE NEED
YOUR HELP FAST!

18:08.241 --> 18:10.277
HELP IS
ON THE WAY.

18:13.083 --> 18:14.417
HAVE WE GOT THE HANG

18:14.418 --> 18:16.621
OF THESE DARING RESCUES
OR WHAT?

18:17.690 --> 18:20.060
QUICK! INTO
THE PIZZA THROWER!

18:20.061 --> 18:22.932
IF THIS WACKY INVENTION
OF DONATELLO'S
DOESN'T WORK,

18:22.933 --> 18:25.736
WE'LL BE A DUO
OF DEPRESSED DUDES.

18:25.737 --> 18:27.740
NO SIGN OF THEM, BOSS.

18:27.741 --> 18:30.044
WHEN I FIND
THOSE 2 NOSY FEMALES,

18:30.045 --> 18:31.847
THEY'LL BE REAL SORRY.

18:31.848 --> 18:34.451
THE TURTLES
HAD BETTER HURRY.

18:36.588 --> 18:38.425
WHO SAID TURTLE POWER?

18:38.426 --> 18:39.961
WE DID, DUDE.

18:43.301 --> 18:45.737
HELP! GET ME DOWN.

18:45.738 --> 18:47.740
GET THOSE AMPHIBIANS.

18:47.741 --> 18:50.912
IT SO HAPPENS
WE'RE REPTILES.

18:52.215 --> 18:55.086
LET'S GIVE
THIS GUY THE HOOK.

18:55.087 --> 18:56.588
AYE AYE, SKIPPER.

18:56.589 --> 18:58.457
GANGSTER AWAY!

19:00.329 --> 19:04.101
THIS IS HUMILIATING.

19:04.102 --> 19:06.472
I BETTER SCRAM.

19:06.473 --> 19:08.441
WRONG,
MR. TORTELLI.

19:08.442 --> 19:11.113
YOU'RE NOT
GOING ANYWHERE.

19:13.185 --> 19:16.389
YOUR KIMONO-STEALING
DAYS ARE OVER.

19:16.390 --> 19:19.526
OH, YEAH?
THAT'S WHAT YOU THINK.

19:22.200 --> 19:23.701
WE'VE GOT HIM NOW.

19:23.702 --> 19:25.804
THERE'S NO WAY OUT
OF THAT CARGO HOLD.

19:25.805 --> 19:26.905
ARE YOU SURE?

19:29.479 --> 19:32.282
SO LONG, SUCKERS.

19:32.283 --> 19:35.254
QUICK. INTO
THE SEWER TUBES.

19:45.472 --> 19:48.176
RIDE 'EM, TURTLES!

19:49.880 --> 19:52.482
WHAT THE HOOK'S
GOING ON?

19:52.483 --> 19:55.087
IT'S WIPE-OUT TIME!

20:03.802 --> 20:07.308
THIS IS ENOUGH TO MAKE
A GUY GO STRAIGHT.

20:07.309 --> 20:10.280
HERE IT IS--
MR. SPLINTER'S KIMONO.

20:10.281 --> 20:12.450
YEAH, THANKS TO YOU,
AUNT AGGIE,

20:12.451 --> 20:15.454
THE CITY IS
ONCE AGAIN SAFE
FOR THE KIMONO-CLAD.

20:15.455 --> 20:16.957
TELL US, TORTELLI,

20:16.958 --> 20:19.361
WHY DID YOU
WANT ALL THOSE
KIMONOS ANYWAY?

20:19.362 --> 20:21.364
WELL, IF YOU HAVE TO KNOW,

20:21.365 --> 20:23.802
THERE'S A MAP WOVEN
INTO ONE OF THEM.

20:23.803 --> 20:26.306
I HAD TO GRAB 'EM ALL
TO FIND THE RIGHT ONE.

20:26.307 --> 20:28.543
A MAP? TO WHAT?

20:28.544 --> 20:31.548
TO A FABULOUS
BURIED TREASURE.

20:31.549 --> 20:34.219
YOU MEAN THE MAP ON
MR. SPLINTER'S KIMONO?

20:34.220 --> 20:36.824
THE ONE THAT SHOWS
WHERE THE LOST TREASURE

20:36.825 --> 20:39.229
OF EMPEROR NAKAMURA
IS BURIED?

20:39.230 --> 20:40.730
YEAH, THAT'S THE ONE.

20:40.731 --> 20:42.667
YOU KNOW ABOUT
THE TREASURE?

20:42.668 --> 20:45.405
I OUGHT TO.
I LED THE EXPEDITION

20:45.406 --> 20:47.008
THAT DUG IT UP LAST YEAR.

20:47.009 --> 20:48.877
YOU ALREADY FOUND IT?

20:51.716 --> 20:54.187
IT SEEMS YOU WENT THROUGH
ALL THIS FOR NOTHING,

20:54.188 --> 20:55.656
MR. TORTELLI.

20:55.657 --> 20:57.993
OH, WHY, I OUGHT TO--

20:57.994 --> 20:59.195
UH, TELL ME,

20:59.196 --> 21:00.730
DO YOU THINK
I SHOULD GO BACK

21:00.731 --> 21:02.701
TO WEARING MY HAIR
THIS WAY?

21:08.077 --> 21:10.648
YOU RECOVERED
MY PRECIOUS KIMONO.

21:10.649 --> 21:12.617
I CANNOT
THANK YOU ENOUGH.

21:12.618 --> 21:15.622
<i>DON'T THANK US, SENSEI.
THANK AUNT AGGIE.</i>

21:15.623 --> 21:17.726
SPEAKING OF AUNT AGGIE,
WHERE DID SHE GO?

21:17.727 --> 21:19.795
OH, RIGHT HERE,
RAPHAEL.

21:19.796 --> 21:23.769
I'VE BAKED
A VERY SPECIAL PIZZA
FOR ALL OF YOU.

21:23.770 --> 21:26.407
GREAT!
FABULOSO!

21:26.408 --> 21:28.578
