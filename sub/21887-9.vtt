00:00.078 --> 00:01.671
<i>Previously on "Gotham"...</i>

00:03.781 --> 00:05.867
Taking a life will
lead you down a darker path

00:05.933 --> 00:07.532
than you can ever imagine.

00:07.566 --> 00:09.466
I know. I've been down it.

00:09.491 --> 00:11.691
I'm not the hero Gotham needs.

00:11.727 --> 00:14.761
And it's gonna be a
long, bumpy journey back.

00:17.633 --> 00:20.033
You've met Martin, I see.

00:20.068 --> 00:22.068
You and I, we're more than friends.

00:22.104 --> 00:24.037
We're conspirators.

00:25.474 --> 00:26.640
Got him!

00:27.442 --> 00:29.509
Oh, oh, no.

00:32.247 --> 00:34.648
You are relieved
of duty, Harvey Bullock.

00:34.683 --> 00:37.860
As of this moment, I'm assuming
the captaincy of Gotham Central.

00:37.950 --> 00:40.149
What did you have to do to get it?

00:42.624 --> 00:44.391
<i>Gotham finds itself in the hands</i>

00:44.426 --> 00:48.428
<i>of a ritualistic cop killer,
being called Professor Pyg.</i>

00:48.463 --> 00:51.831
It doesn't stop until
I've butchered every single

00:51.867 --> 00:54.935
swine on Penguin's payroll.

00:56.171 --> 00:57.237
I'm gonna find you.

00:57.272 --> 00:58.405
I hope you do.

00:58.440 --> 01:00.206
<i>It's a spectacle.</i>

01:02.277 --> 01:05.645
And you're my muse, Jimmy Gordon.

01:07.182 --> 01:10.083
My poor lost lambs.

01:10.118 --> 01:13.620
I come to you today
with an offer for this evening.

01:13.655 --> 01:17.724
Fresh biscuits
and a hearty bowl of soup.

01:17.759 --> 01:18.902
- Wait.
- Mm.

01:18.992 --> 01:22.527
I have place settings for six.

01:24.599 --> 01:26.800
Nobody wants some fresh pumpkin pie?

01:26.835 --> 01:28.535
Smile.

01:42.150 --> 01:44.284
My children,

01:44.319 --> 01:47.581
there are two Gothams:

01:47.659 --> 01:52.492
the Haves and the Have Nots.

01:52.527 --> 01:58.131
I know what it is
to feel like a Have Not.

01:58.166 --> 01:59.666
But...

01:59.701 --> 02:02.502
I say, enough.

02:04.806 --> 02:07.374
Here's to giving the Haves...

02:07.409 --> 02:12.379
...a taste of what it is like to be...

02:12.971 --> 02:15.215
a Have Not.

02:33.587 --> 02:35.837
Let's begin.

02:36.371 --> 02:38.238
Shall we?

03:00.159 --> 03:02.529
I'll be out of your way
in just a second, Captain.

03:02.564 --> 03:06.831
Harvey, this isn't how
I wanted things to go down.

03:06.909 --> 03:09.836
And yet, here we are.

03:09.871 --> 03:12.839
You know what I was
thinking about today?

03:12.874 --> 03:14.774
Our first case.

03:14.817 --> 03:17.451
When I told you to walk Penguin
to the end of the pier,

03:17.479 --> 03:18.945
put a bullet in his head,

03:18.980 --> 03:21.381
and dump him in the water,
and you wouldn't.

03:21.416 --> 03:22.515
You thought it was wrong.

03:22.551 --> 03:23.582
It was.

03:23.652 --> 03:25.518
Well, maybe if you would've done it,

03:25.554 --> 03:27.821
Falcone would still be running things,

03:27.856 --> 03:31.291
and a lot of people who are dead
would be alive today.

03:31.326 --> 03:35.028
If I could go back,
I'd do the same thing.

03:35.063 --> 03:36.340
Because you still don't understand

03:36.364 --> 03:37.764
how this city works, Jim.

03:37.799 --> 03:39.466
You want to be a hero.

03:39.501 --> 03:41.589
And Gotham doesn't need heroes.

03:41.644 --> 03:44.904
It needs people who will
do what is necessary.

03:44.940 --> 03:46.406
You're wrong.

03:46.441 --> 03:49.409
If you show 'em the way,
the people will follow.

03:49.444 --> 03:51.311
Guess we'll just have to wait
and see, huh?

03:53.548 --> 03:55.281
When your leave is up,

03:55.317 --> 03:57.684
there'll be a desk here waiting for you.

03:57.719 --> 04:00.086
Sit around and watch you all day?

04:00.122 --> 04:01.688
No, thanks.

04:09.547 --> 04:11.698
Right there is perfect. Thank you.

04:16.805 --> 04:18.071
Beautiful.

04:19.975 --> 04:21.975
I predict this evening's fundraiser

04:22.010 --> 04:24.811
- will be a smashing success.
- If I want Gotham's

04:24.846 --> 04:26.646
wealthiest families
to support the orphanage,

04:26.681 --> 04:28.448
things have to be perfect.

04:28.893 --> 04:31.451
I appreciate you taking part, Oswald.

04:31.486 --> 04:33.520
Yes.

04:33.555 --> 04:35.622
Sadly, a situation has arisen.

04:35.657 --> 04:37.390
No.

04:37.425 --> 04:39.259
That thing in the Narrows,

04:39.294 --> 04:40.760
with your former chief of staff?

04:40.795 --> 04:43.596
No, no. This is far more serious.

04:43.632 --> 04:47.567
It has to do with Mayor Burke
promoting James Gordon

04:47.602 --> 04:49.569
to captain of the GCPD.

04:49.604 --> 04:51.936
You're not really worried
about James Gordon?

04:51.974 --> 04:53.239
Please.

04:53.264 --> 04:57.544
The issue is the person
who ordered his appointment.

04:57.579 --> 04:59.445
- I see.
- Do you?

05:00.601 --> 05:03.116
Oswald, we both know
the mayor is a weasel.

05:03.151 --> 05:04.861
Someone must have paid him off.

05:05.273 --> 05:08.655
But I don't see why that means
you can't attend my dinner.

05:08.690 --> 05:11.824
Because, my dear,
the mayor has vanished.

05:11.860 --> 05:13.860
But I will find him,

05:13.895 --> 05:16.496
I will learn the name of my enemy,

05:16.531 --> 05:18.932
and there will be a reckoning.

05:21.236 --> 05:24.604
And that is why I might not
be able to make it this evening.

05:24.839 --> 05:26.645
Very well.

05:27.042 --> 05:29.136
But a few of the children
are doing a song.

05:29.197 --> 05:31.353
Martin is taking part.

05:31.439 --> 05:33.090
It would mean the world
to him if you could come.

05:33.114 --> 05:34.781
Of course.

05:36.284 --> 05:39.085
Now, don't let me keep you.

05:46.394 --> 05:50.366
If you think she's the one,
we could have Victor...

05:50.599 --> 05:52.991
talk to her?

05:53.358 --> 05:57.798
You do realize she is...
literally my only friend.

05:58.006 --> 06:01.642
I need the mayor. I need proof.

06:01.876 --> 06:05.612
But, sir, what if Ms. Falcone...
not to say it is her...

06:05.647 --> 06:10.917
has seen to it that the mayor
is missing, well, permanently?

06:13.521 --> 06:17.743
I could be chasing a ghost while
she prepares her next move.

06:18.133 --> 06:21.380
I wish I had a spy,

06:21.529 --> 06:24.030
close to her, someone quiet.

06:30.171 --> 06:31.704
Bring me Martin.

06:31.740 --> 06:33.206
Who?

06:33.241 --> 06:35.908
The boy with the pad around his neck.

06:35.944 --> 06:37.944
The one who can't talk.

06:49.824 --> 06:51.724
I thought I was clear. We're done.

06:51.760 --> 06:53.226
<i>Penguin suspects something.</i>

06:53.261 --> 06:54.894
What are you talking about?

06:54.929 --> 06:56.796
He was just here,
saying that he couldn't come

06:56.831 --> 06:58.865
to the party I'm having tonight
for the orphanage.

06:58.900 --> 07:01.067
He knows someone paid the mayor
to make you captain.

07:01.102 --> 07:03.569
<u>I think he suspects me.</u>

07:03.605 --> 07:06.406
- Have you warned the mayor?
- <i>I'm not a fool, Jim.</i>

07:06.441 --> 07:08.241
I had him leave town
after your appointment.

07:08.276 --> 07:10.943
Sounds like you have
your bases covered, as usual.

07:10.979 --> 07:12.945
Thanks for the heads-up about Penguin.

07:12.981 --> 07:15.315
Don't call me again.

07:19.688 --> 07:21.354
This is Harper.

07:21.389 --> 07:22.722
Gordon, line one.

07:22.757 --> 07:24.057
Says it's private.

07:27.429 --> 07:28.828
Sofia.

07:28.863 --> 07:30.963
<i>Wrong. Try again.</i>

07:31.133 --> 07:34.485
- You son of a bitch.
- Yeah, attaboy, Jim.

07:34.579 --> 07:36.169
Or should I say Captain?

07:36.204 --> 07:38.173
<i>Congratulations, by the way.</i>

07:38.235 --> 07:40.807
<i>So, do you remember when you said</i>

07:40.842 --> 07:43.476
the rot in Gotham went from high to low?

07:43.511 --> 07:45.812
<i>You've hit the nail on the head.</i>

07:45.847 --> 07:48.654
Police were low.

07:48.850 --> 07:53.486
Now it's time for Gotham's elite
to feel the pain.

07:54.517 --> 07:56.489
Enter Phase Two.

07:57.720 --> 08:00.220
I won't spoil the reveal.

08:00.729 --> 08:05.202
Hurry outside for a little taste
of what's to come.

08:05.500 --> 08:06.999
Ciao, mon ami.

08:09.404 --> 08:11.270
He's outside. Let's go.

08:12.221 --> 08:14.255
GCPD.

08:15.243 --> 08:18.044
GCPD! Make way.

08:18.079 --> 08:19.779
- GCPD. Excuse me.
- Back up.

08:28.337 --> 08:31.172
- Are they dead?
- Get forensics here.

08:31.426 --> 08:33.760
And I want this whole area
closed off. No press.

08:33.794 --> 08:37.330
That pig's eating that guy.

08:42.570 --> 08:44.861
Now, Harper.

08:45.039 --> 08:46.506
Excuse me.

08:52.868 --> 08:54.814
Where's breakfast?

08:54.962 --> 08:56.460
Breakfast was

08:56.525 --> 08:59.239
produced and consumed
by yours truly at breakfast time.

08:59.322 --> 09:03.310
It is now fast approaching
luncheon, Master Bruce.

09:03.345 --> 09:05.345
Whatever, just give me a coffee.

09:07.883 --> 09:09.649
Enjoying the benefits

09:09.825 --> 09:12.025
of another night out
on the tiles with Tommy Elliot

09:12.091 --> 09:13.924
and his band of miscreants, are we?

09:15.757 --> 09:17.657
How absolutely delightful.

09:20.428 --> 09:22.668
I know what you're going
through, you know, Master Bruce.

09:22.716 --> 09:23.832
Yeah.

09:23.918 --> 09:26.533
I went out with my friends.
I'm hungover.

09:26.654 --> 09:28.521
Doesn't take a genius to figure it out.

09:28.565 --> 09:30.265
You're lost is what you are.

09:30.300 --> 09:32.934
I've seen that
countless times... young men,

09:32.970 --> 09:34.869
going off to war with a clear purpose,

09:34.905 --> 09:37.906
only to return home to a normal
life, unable to assimilate.

09:37.941 --> 09:39.574
Confused, angry.

09:39.610 --> 09:41.643
And they make a complete tosh of it.

09:41.678 --> 09:44.312
I don't really care.

09:45.916 --> 09:49.517
You killed Ra's al Ghul.

09:49.653 --> 09:51.686
Vengeance for your parents' death

09:51.722 --> 09:53.655
has been your driving force for so long.

09:53.690 --> 09:56.014
You are completely lost without it.

09:56.087 --> 09:57.779
I need to call Tommy.

10:00.230 --> 10:02.397
Have you forgotten what day it is today?

10:02.432 --> 10:04.466
- Give me my phone.
- You have, ain't you?

10:04.501 --> 10:06.819
Today is the day
my father took me camping

10:06.866 --> 10:08.717
and we put a rock on
top of Mount Bristol.

10:08.792 --> 10:11.545
We did it every year.
Now give me my phone.

10:20.410 --> 10:24.045
You are Bruce Wayne,
son of Thomas Wayne.

10:24.087 --> 10:26.221
And the sooner you start
remembering that, the better.

10:27.991 --> 10:30.458
So, you drink your coffee.

10:30.494 --> 10:33.328
You go upstairs, you put
your kit on, 'cause you and I...

10:34.831 --> 10:36.364
...are going for a walk.

10:43.940 --> 10:45.607
According to the medical examiner,

10:45.642 --> 10:48.674
both victims had been
living outdoors for some time.

10:48.729 --> 10:50.111
Most likely homeless.

10:50.147 --> 10:51.546
Now, see these incisions?

10:53.850 --> 10:55.116
He removed their organs.

10:55.152 --> 10:57.118
- Any idea why?
- Not yet.

10:57.519 --> 11:00.121
Pyg all but announced
that his next victims

11:00.157 --> 11:03.525
would be the rich and powerful,
the high in Gotham.

11:03.560 --> 11:05.327
So why is he killing the homeless?

11:05.362 --> 11:08.360
You're asking for logic
from a psychopath.

11:08.415 --> 11:09.431
From him, yeah.

11:09.466 --> 11:11.644
Everything he's done has been
thought through carefully.

11:11.668 --> 11:14.102
There was a card on the table in French,

11:14.137 --> 11:16.485
said, "Long Live the Revolution."

11:16.610 --> 11:19.007
Maybe he's using them
to make a statement.

11:20.337 --> 11:22.978
- He wants the city's attention.
- For what?

11:23.555 --> 11:26.789
He said this was just
a taste of what's to come.

11:26.817 --> 11:28.650
There's a piece that's still missing.

11:29.057 --> 11:31.152
The homeless are densest in the Narrows.

11:31.188 --> 11:32.454
I'm gonna start there.

11:32.489 --> 11:34.322
Hell of a first day to be captain.

11:34.358 --> 11:35.490
Yeah.

11:35.525 --> 11:37.075
Call me, you find anything else.

11:37.778 --> 11:39.627
We checked all buildings

11:39.663 --> 11:41.965
in a three-block radius,
Captain. Nothing.

11:42.165 --> 11:44.299
All right, widen it out
a couple of blocks.

11:44.334 --> 11:47.577
Focus on buildings with
protected loading docks.

11:48.071 --> 11:50.739
Captain, that was Lucius Fox.

11:50.774 --> 11:52.240
Final tox came back.

11:52.275 --> 11:53.975
Both victims had sodium sulfide

11:54.010 --> 11:55.543
and chlorine residue on their skin.

11:55.579 --> 11:58.420
He says it's common in
paper manufacturing.

11:59.149 --> 12:01.316
There's an old paper plant
few blocks from here

12:01.351 --> 12:03.985
that closed down a while back.
Let's check that out.

12:14.164 --> 12:15.964
Backup's still incoming. Should we wait?

12:15.999 --> 12:17.499
No.

12:18.935 --> 12:20.935
Over here.

12:25.409 --> 12:27.308
What is he doing to them?

12:27.451 --> 12:29.785
Taking their organs.

12:36.518 --> 12:38.268
A smoker oven?

12:39.299 --> 12:41.322
He's cooking them.

13:08.084 --> 13:09.584
Harper?

13:15.258 --> 13:16.684
Drop the gun,

13:16.793 --> 13:18.598
Captain.

13:18.762 --> 13:21.262
- Shoot this bastard.
- Drop it!

13:27.771 --> 13:29.103
Thank you.

13:29.605 --> 13:33.995
You found me too soon, James.

13:34.311 --> 13:35.844
The table's not yet set,

13:35.879 --> 13:39.547
and no meal should be served
before its time.

13:39.583 --> 13:41.316
You want a hostage, take me.

13:41.351 --> 13:43.551
No, no, no, no, no.
That won't do at all.

13:43.809 --> 13:46.154
You must see my final act.

13:47.524 --> 13:49.757
Along with all of Gotham.

14:04.339 --> 14:07.167
Right, well, it's a lovely day for it.

14:07.509 --> 14:09.509
Best foot forward.

14:13.526 --> 14:15.260
Very distinguished.

14:15.285 --> 14:17.085
Sofia tells me you're taking part

14:17.139 --> 14:19.260
in a performance this evening.

14:19.339 --> 14:22.963
Oh. She's quite a lady, isn't she?

14:23.850 --> 14:25.850
She's been a friend to both of us.

14:27.847 --> 14:29.147
Or has she?

14:31.115 --> 14:32.915
Martin,

14:33.102 --> 14:37.188
I worry Sofia is only
pretending to be my friend.

14:37.652 --> 14:39.097
And worse,

14:39.492 --> 14:41.659
I fear she may be using you.

14:47.924 --> 14:52.937
Now... I've been
running this over in my mind,

14:52.972 --> 14:56.174
and there are two ways
this might have gone.

14:56.209 --> 15:00.211
One, Sofia chose a
specific orphan... you...

15:00.253 --> 15:01.819
to place in my path.

15:01.848 --> 15:03.548
She groomed you.

15:03.583 --> 15:05.483
She told you how to act.

15:05.904 --> 15:07.552
Or...

15:08.161 --> 15:11.355
Sofia simply collected
a group of children,

15:11.401 --> 15:14.569
hoping one would gain my trust

15:15.126 --> 15:17.528
and make me easier to manipulate.

15:20.867 --> 15:23.601
In this version, you are innocent.

15:28.875 --> 15:30.686
Martin...

15:30.877 --> 15:34.245
this is the version
I very badly want to believe.

15:34.704 --> 15:37.258
But I need proof.

15:37.283 --> 15:38.950
Of our friendship.

15:38.985 --> 15:41.852
I need to know
if my suspicions are correct.

15:41.888 --> 15:44.388
And if so, what Sofia is planning

15:44.424 --> 15:46.224
and who she is planning it with.

15:46.259 --> 15:49.678
I need you to be my eyes and my ears.

15:51.170 --> 15:53.097
Do you think you can do that?

16:00.807 --> 16:04.125
Don't let me down, Martin.

16:04.310 --> 16:05.643
Please.

16:14.687 --> 16:17.221
I want a city-wide BOLO on that van.

16:17.257 --> 16:20.903
I want every cop in Gotham on
the streets, looking for Harper.

16:21.127 --> 16:23.327
She will not be the Pyg's next victim.

16:23.363 --> 16:24.495
Go.

16:27.300 --> 16:28.886
- Captain Gordon!
- Captain Gordon!

16:30.336 --> 16:33.304
Is it true that the serial
killer known as the Pyg is back?

16:33.339 --> 16:34.839
That he's responsible for the scene

16:34.874 --> 16:36.874
outside the GCPD this morning?

16:36.909 --> 16:38.209
We believe so, yes.

16:38.244 --> 16:41.425
We've also heard he's kidnapped
a GCPD detective.

16:41.488 --> 16:43.269
How can you keep the
people of Gotham safe

16:43.332 --> 16:45.681
when you can't protect
your own officers?

16:45.759 --> 16:49.420
We remain hopeful for
Detective Harper's safe return.

16:49.455 --> 16:51.122
Let me be clear.

16:51.157 --> 16:54.925
The GCPD will stop this monster;
that's a promise.

16:54.950 --> 16:56.093
And if you fail, will you be

16:56.129 --> 16:57.795
pushed aside like Harvey Bullock was?

16:59.731 --> 17:02.266
We're done here. Thank you.

17:02.302 --> 17:06.304
What about the rumor that the
Pyg is now cooking his victims?

17:08.406 --> 17:09.939
Who told you that?

17:10.076 --> 17:11.760
Is it true?

17:12.056 --> 17:15.691
As I said, the GCPD will
bring the Pyg to justice.

17:15.798 --> 17:17.214
That's all.

17:19.242 --> 17:20.442
Captain Gordon!

17:26.092 --> 17:28.893
Someone leaked to the press that
the Pyg is cooking his victims.

17:28.928 --> 17:31.896
Maybe it was the Pyg.

17:31.931 --> 17:34.598
We know he wants attention.

17:34.634 --> 17:38.803
Look, Jim, everyone in
the department is on your side.

17:39.443 --> 17:40.819
Yeah.

17:42.041 --> 17:44.141
There's something you need to see.

17:48.130 --> 17:50.845
"I grant this food
will be somewhat dear,

17:50.917 --> 17:54.218
"and therefore very proper
for landlords, who,

17:54.253 --> 17:58.011
"as they have already
devoured most of the parents,

17:58.257 --> 18:01.714
seem to have the best title
to the children."

18:02.428 --> 18:04.985
It's Jonathan Swift,
"A Modest Proposal."

18:05.063 --> 18:06.230
He made an argument

18:06.265 --> 18:09.200
for cannibalism,
about the rich eating the poor.

18:09.235 --> 18:11.802
The poor are the homeless.

18:11.838 --> 18:13.170
Who are the rich?

18:15.475 --> 18:17.708
Swift didn't just talk about
the rich eating the poor.

18:17.751 --> 18:21.022
He specifically mentioned the orphans.

18:21.314 --> 18:23.214
I know where he's going.

18:23.240 --> 18:24.788
He left this for me.

18:24.984 --> 18:28.385
He's doing exactly what he did
with Harvey. It could be a trap.

18:28.688 --> 18:30.688
And I won't lead more officers
to their deaths.

18:30.723 --> 18:33.296
- You're going alone?
- I'm sorry, Lucius.

18:37.274 --> 18:39.537
Where's Chef Louis?

18:39.692 --> 18:41.758
Ici, mademoiselle.

18:43.068 --> 18:47.238
Such a pleasure to meet you in person.

18:48.241 --> 18:50.875
Hmm. I was expecting you earlier.

18:50.910 --> 18:54.528
Apologies. I was detained.

18:54.652 --> 18:57.481
But I've made a small change
in the menu.

18:57.517 --> 19:00.217
I have steered us
away from haute cuisine

19:00.253 --> 19:04.255
to something a bit more... mundane.

19:04.290 --> 19:05.890
Et voilà.

19:13.633 --> 19:17.468
I am calling them Gotham Meat Pies.

19:19.105 --> 19:21.439
Your guests will die for them.

19:25.936 --> 19:28.763
I've made us a delicious
brown English stew

19:28.848 --> 19:31.263
with herb dumplings, Master Bruce.

19:32.142 --> 19:35.138
Your father used to love it
when I made stew.

19:37.476 --> 19:40.671
Did I ever tell you
how I met your old man?

19:42.295 --> 19:45.096
In London. He was doing
postgrad work there.

19:45.131 --> 19:47.131
He told me.

19:49.944 --> 19:52.470
Yeah, but no details.

19:52.668 --> 19:55.536
Well, I was just out
the army, two months.

19:55.592 --> 19:57.208
Don't remember any of it.

19:57.243 --> 20:00.732
All a bit of a blur, really...
booze, drugs, brawling.

20:01.247 --> 20:03.581
A sucking great black cloud.

20:06.219 --> 20:08.553
One day, I wake up and
I'm lying in this alley,

20:08.588 --> 20:11.322
and I'm covered in
blood... don't know how.

20:11.357 --> 20:12.657
So I picked myself up,

20:12.692 --> 20:14.659
I took myself straight down
to the police station,

20:14.694 --> 20:16.394
turned myself in, hoping that they would

20:16.429 --> 20:19.363
chuck me into the big house
and throw away the key.

20:19.399 --> 20:22.233
And they told me to shut up,
sit down and wait.

20:22.268 --> 20:23.801
And there was this

20:23.837 --> 20:26.304
really annoying Yank wandering about,

20:26.339 --> 20:28.150
dressed like he was
ready for a game of tennis,

20:28.174 --> 20:29.574
and it was your dad.

20:29.609 --> 20:33.177
Anyway, he bowls up to me,
asks me what I done.

20:33.213 --> 20:34.935
Asking me questions.

20:35.013 --> 20:36.358
Eventually, you know, I found myself

20:36.382 --> 20:40.551
telling him stuff that I was too
frightened even to think about.

20:40.587 --> 20:43.187
But I guess it'd just been building.

20:43.223 --> 20:45.490
Anyway, that point, the desk
sergeant called him over,

20:45.525 --> 20:47.825
and your dad turned
around to me and he said,

20:47.861 --> 20:51.413
"Alfred, last night, I was
being attacked in that alley,

20:51.865 --> 20:53.342
"and you started fighting this geezer.

20:53.366 --> 20:55.743
I headed on my toes, and I ran away."

20:56.302 --> 20:58.269
And I said, "Yeah, but
that's not what happened,

20:58.304 --> 20:59.604
is it, Thomas?"

21:00.446 --> 21:02.931
And he says, "It is now."

21:04.978 --> 21:07.206
Your father saved my life.

21:08.534 --> 21:12.517
His friendship saved me.

21:13.887 --> 21:16.487
You see, I know what it's
all like, being lonely.

21:16.523 --> 21:19.790
Hoping that the world will punish you.

21:21.728 --> 21:24.028
I can help you.

21:28.315 --> 21:30.917
- Bruce...
- Alfred, I hear you.

21:31.471 --> 21:33.690
I just don't want to talk
about this right now.

21:35.808 --> 21:37.454
All right.

21:38.912 --> 21:40.912
Well, this looks lovely.

21:43.716 --> 21:47.084
The rocks are gone.
They must've fell out in the car.

21:47.127 --> 21:49.482
Oh, the keys are in the bag, just there.

22:19.252 --> 22:21.317
- Beautiful. So nice to see you, dear.
- Thanks.

22:21.387 --> 22:23.221
Yes.

22:25.558 --> 22:27.892
Oswald, you came!

22:27.927 --> 22:29.860
Look at you two.

22:29.896 --> 22:31.362
So handsome.

22:31.397 --> 22:33.831
I know how important
tonight's party is to you.

22:34.431 --> 22:36.601
And I wouldn't have forgiven myself

22:36.636 --> 22:38.703
if I missed Martin's performance.

22:39.729 --> 22:42.330
Why don't you go find
the other children.

22:45.445 --> 22:47.445
Did you locate the mayor?

22:48.371 --> 22:50.114
Unfortunately, no.

22:50.149 --> 22:51.449
Hmm.

22:51.484 --> 22:53.584
But I have not given up hope.

22:53.627 --> 22:55.293
Well, I, for one, am happy.

22:55.321 --> 22:57.521
This way, you get to come to my dinner.

22:58.430 --> 23:01.837
I need to go check on the chef.
He seems a bit odd.

23:01.884 --> 23:04.543
Please try and enjoy yourself.

23:12.306 --> 23:14.564
Let's go. Straight ahead,
down to the left.

23:41.567 --> 23:43.960
Hello, Martin.

23:44.904 --> 23:47.194
What are you writing?

23:52.512 --> 23:53.978
Don't make a noise.

23:54.013 --> 23:56.048
Shh.

23:56.766 --> 23:58.416
I'm a cop.

23:58.451 --> 23:59.750
Who are you?

23:59.786 --> 24:01.786
A-A waiter.

24:01.821 --> 24:04.950
I'm looking for a man,
Caucasian, about five-foot-ten.

24:04.996 --> 24:06.991
He would've brought the food.
Maybe the chef.

24:07.026 --> 24:09.026
Uh, the chef's in the kitchen.

24:09.062 --> 24:10.795
Look, I just got hired tonight.

24:10.835 --> 24:12.541
Whatever the dude's into,
I have no idea. I'm just here...

24:12.565 --> 24:14.131
You're okay, you're okay.

24:14.167 --> 24:16.334
Do me a favor, find
Ms. Falcone, bring her to me.

24:16.369 --> 24:19.405
- Can you do that for me?
- Yeah. All right.

24:20.707 --> 24:22.506
What's that in your jacket?

24:29.849 --> 24:33.417
Jim Gordon really is
an impressive policeman.

24:33.453 --> 24:35.052
Is he alone?

24:35.088 --> 24:36.554
Seems so.

24:36.589 --> 24:39.824
But, man, whatever it is you're into,

24:39.859 --> 24:41.359
my partner and I?

24:41.394 --> 24:43.127
Our rates just doubled.

25:04.283 --> 25:06.348
Harper.

25:06.723 --> 25:09.086
My friends, the Falcone orphanage

25:09.122 --> 25:12.374
is the realization
of a long cherished dream,

25:12.421 --> 25:16.193
and one that would not have been
possible without your support.

25:16.725 --> 25:18.896
- So thank you. Cheers.
- Cheers.

25:18.931 --> 25:21.009
Now, if you could please take
your seats in the next room,

25:21.033 --> 25:23.334
a few of the children
have prepared a song.

25:25.705 --> 25:27.104
Where's Martin?

25:27.140 --> 25:28.906
I wanted to wish him luck.

25:28.941 --> 25:30.875
Ah. Off getting ready, no doubt.

25:32.781 --> 25:35.031
Oswald, I've been thinking.

25:35.214 --> 25:37.523
Maybe things happen for a reason.

25:37.650 --> 25:39.617
Licensing crime was a bold move,

25:39.652 --> 25:41.886
but it would've destroyed you.

25:41.965 --> 25:45.011
Whoever had Jim Gordon appointed captain

25:45.191 --> 25:47.291
may actually have saved you.

25:48.222 --> 25:51.629
By attempting to destroy
everything I ever created?

25:51.664 --> 25:53.464
- Oswald...
- Enough.

25:53.499 --> 25:56.634
If you're going to confess, confess.

25:56.999 --> 25:59.241
And face the consequences.

26:01.007 --> 26:03.340
So sorry to interrupt.

26:05.077 --> 26:07.745
The servers are getting everyone seated.

26:07.780 --> 26:10.581
We don't want the food to get cold.

26:10.616 --> 26:13.851
Shall we go in to dinner?

26:13.893 --> 26:15.726
Chop, chop.

26:21.621 --> 26:25.258
All right. I stopped
the bleeding, I think.

26:25.413 --> 26:28.656
That's the best I can do
until I can get you out of here.

26:29.561 --> 26:31.094
Got to get that door open.

26:31.146 --> 26:33.208
- Gordon.
- Maybe I can get the hinges off.

26:33.263 --> 26:35.222
Gordon.

26:35.257 --> 26:36.991
Idiots forgot to search me.

26:55.678 --> 26:57.778
Was this another one of your plans?

26:57.813 --> 26:59.246
No.

27:01.250 --> 27:05.085
Ladies and gentlemen,
as you by now have surmised,

27:05.193 --> 27:08.162
there's been a change in the program.

27:08.190 --> 27:12.022
Tonight, we are proud to present

27:12.132 --> 27:16.124
the six merry Gothamites
of Squatter's Row,

27:16.194 --> 27:17.364
and Martin,

27:17.400 --> 27:20.367
from the Falcone
Home and School for Orphans,

27:20.403 --> 27:22.870
in our rendition of...

27:24.007 --> 27:27.675
the "Meat Pie Tango."

If you hurt them, I swear...

28:11.921 --> 28:13.187
Rude.

28:13.222 --> 28:14.621
I'm not finished.

28:15.018 --> 28:16.657
Sit down.

28:17.979 --> 28:21.261
Pull it out,
and the next one's in her eye.

28:21.297 --> 28:22.297
Oswald, no.

28:28.191 --> 28:30.604
Now, to answer your question, my dear,

28:30.639 --> 28:32.580
the other children and your staff

28:32.605 --> 28:34.942
are safely locked in the kitchen.

28:34.977 --> 28:38.278
Despite appearances, I'm not an animal.

28:40.514 --> 28:42.049
Martin.

28:42.084 --> 28:43.617
May we continue?

28:46.655 --> 28:50.624
You have all fed upon
the poor of Gotham for years.

28:50.825 --> 28:54.128
Now you're going to know
what they taste like.

28:54.163 --> 28:58.599
Please, open your envelopes and
look at the photographs inside.

29:00.369 --> 29:02.002
Oh, come on.

29:02.916 --> 29:05.038
Open them!

29:12.495 --> 29:14.348
Who is Trish?

29:14.738 --> 29:17.317
Well, I thought you should
see who you're eating.

29:19.051 --> 29:21.121
Bob, Fricks,

29:21.293 --> 29:23.624
Trish, Nunuh, Cyrano and Vincent

29:23.659 --> 29:26.699
all deserve our gratitude.

29:27.074 --> 29:29.196
So these pies are...

29:29.231 --> 29:30.864
People. Yep.

29:30.900 --> 29:32.366
They're people pies.

29:32.401 --> 29:34.815
People.

29:35.037 --> 29:37.571
And you're all going to eat them.

29:37.606 --> 29:38.839
Oh, no.

29:38.874 --> 29:42.910
Absolutely not.

29:42.961 --> 29:44.961
Okay.

29:48.918 --> 29:50.517
Let's try this again.

29:50.553 --> 29:51.919
No!

29:51.954 --> 29:54.855
Eat, or I kill the boy.

29:54.890 --> 29:57.057
But he's just an orphan.

29:59.595 --> 30:01.128
What did you say?

30:01.163 --> 30:02.896
Well, these are made of people.

30:02.932 --> 30:05.332
For God's sake, you can't expect us...

30:05.367 --> 30:08.001
I mean, so they kill some urchin, hmm?

30:14.610 --> 30:16.610
What a waste of a good pie.

30:17.780 --> 30:20.180
But I do applaud the sentiment.

30:20.216 --> 30:24.017
Especially as you, Mr. Cobblepot,
are the reason I'm here.

30:24.053 --> 30:26.620
Me? Why?

30:26.655 --> 30:30.457
Oh, I could've chosen any
gathering of wealthy Gothamites

30:30.618 --> 30:32.743
who've gotten fat upon the poor.

30:32.805 --> 30:36.626
But you, with your Pax Penguina,

30:36.704 --> 30:38.994
you are the biggest glutton of them all.

30:39.040 --> 30:41.559
You have gorged yourself
on this city's heart,

30:41.604 --> 30:44.504
its lungs, its liver.

30:44.540 --> 30:46.540
Why should today be any different?

30:46.575 --> 30:49.211
Now eat, little Penguin.

30:49.257 --> 30:50.602
Eat.

30:50.653 --> 30:53.120
Eat the pies, or the boy dies.

31:20.728 --> 31:22.194
If you don't eat,

31:22.278 --> 31:26.246
I will hunt you down and kill you all!

31:31.070 --> 31:34.688
Now, that's what I like to see.

31:45.801 --> 31:48.532
And as Mother always used to say,

31:48.579 --> 31:52.079
"Nobody leaves until
every plate is clean."

31:52.157 --> 31:55.809
It's a compliment to the chef,
and I love compliments.

31:57.379 --> 31:59.046
And, Ms. Falcone...

32:02.785 --> 32:05.919
...mangia, signorina.

32:07.957 --> 32:10.157
Only if you don't hurt him.

32:23.405 --> 32:25.405
Can you help me?

32:31.487 --> 32:33.487
Yes.

33:00.743 --> 33:02.843
No!

33:02.878 --> 33:05.212
He'll kill the kid!

33:05.247 --> 33:07.072
Get off of me!

33:07.185 --> 33:08.617
Martin!

33:10.116 --> 33:11.515
Jim!

33:23.832 --> 33:25.665
Get out of here!

33:25.774 --> 33:27.200
Go!

34:08.710 --> 34:10.491
Come on, Jim.

34:10.746 --> 34:13.013
Don't give up. You'll ruin everything.

34:25.487 --> 34:27.353
Should be good.

34:35.070 --> 34:36.875
How is your hand?

34:37.199 --> 34:38.732
I'll be fine.

34:38.766 --> 34:40.067
How's Martin?

34:40.101 --> 34:42.402
He is stronger than he looks.

34:46.976 --> 34:49.509
You paid off the mayor
to make Jim Gordon captain.

34:51.513 --> 34:52.813
Yes.

34:54.483 --> 34:56.183
And you want me to believe

34:56.217 --> 34:58.051
that you did this out of friendship.

34:59.455 --> 35:02.040
To save me.

35:02.791 --> 35:05.192
I tried to talk you
out of the license program.

35:05.235 --> 35:07.327
You wouldn't listen.

35:07.363 --> 35:09.730
There seemed no other way.

35:13.035 --> 35:14.935
Of course, it's equally plausible

35:14.970 --> 35:17.604
that you are my enemy,

35:17.922 --> 35:20.140
intent upon my destruction.

35:21.810 --> 35:23.810
You could choose to see it that way.

35:23.846 --> 35:25.879
Choice is yours, Oswald.

35:25.914 --> 35:30.017
Well, whatever your actual reasoning...

35:32.354 --> 35:34.354
...you went behind my back.

35:36.191 --> 35:38.158
I would be justified in killing you.

35:45.300 --> 35:48.402
But what you were
going to do for Martin...

35:51.640 --> 35:53.240
...that was real.

35:57.179 --> 35:59.372
Don't ever betray me again.

36:00.044 --> 36:01.548
Never.

36:04.586 --> 36:06.686
I will abandon the licenses,

36:06.722 --> 36:09.222
but Jim Gordon cannot be captain.

36:09.258 --> 36:11.191
Pick someone else, then.

36:11.226 --> 36:14.361
Gordon's less than nothing to me.

36:33.348 --> 36:36.716
♪ Bye-bye, Piggy, bye-bye... ♪

36:36.752 --> 36:38.985
Captain Gordon!

36:39.021 --> 36:40.587
Captain Gordon! Captain Gordon!

36:40.622 --> 36:42.785
Captain Gordon?

36:43.292 --> 36:46.841
Is that the Pyg?
Did you really catch him?

36:47.362 --> 36:50.063
The suspect known as
the Pyg is in custody.

36:50.099 --> 36:53.400
Detective Vanessa Harper is
on her way to Gotham General,

36:53.435 --> 36:56.348
and is expected to make a full recovery.

36:57.664 --> 36:59.906
The GCPD kept its promise.

37:02.978 --> 37:04.411
Captain Gordon?

37:04.648 --> 37:06.279
Yes?

37:06.315 --> 37:08.007
Thank you.

37:08.317 --> 37:09.883
Thank you.

37:37.646 --> 37:39.246
Oh.

37:43.218 --> 37:44.818
Hey, hey, Alfred!

37:46.855 --> 37:48.855
How was your walk?

37:48.891 --> 37:51.057
Everybody out now.

37:51.093 --> 37:53.336
Nobody move.

37:54.023 --> 37:56.329
This is not your house.

37:56.365 --> 37:58.632
If I want my friends to stay,
they're staying.

38:03.038 --> 38:04.504
Like hell they are.

38:04.540 --> 38:07.174
Dude, your butler is
a little out of line.

38:07.790 --> 38:09.176
Have you been hitting

38:09.211 --> 38:10.510
the sherry, Jeeves?

38:10.546 --> 38:12.646
You have no idea what extreme danger

38:12.681 --> 38:13.947
you are now in, son.

38:13.982 --> 38:16.850
If I was you, I would walk away.

38:16.885 --> 38:19.048
Yeah, whatever.

38:19.621 --> 38:21.368
Meet us at the club.

38:22.735 --> 38:24.824
Come on. Driver will take us.

38:35.204 --> 38:37.003
Well...

38:40.008 --> 38:42.153
...you've certainly shown
a new side of yourself today,

38:42.177 --> 38:44.144
- haven't you, Master Bruce?
- Save it, Alfred.

38:44.179 --> 38:47.447
You tell me a story
about you and my dad,

38:47.482 --> 38:49.516
and I'm supposed to get all weepy?

38:51.962 --> 38:54.254
You don't know what I'm going through.

38:56.258 --> 38:57.991
You and I are nothing alike.

38:58.087 --> 39:00.328
Then talk to me.

39:01.630 --> 39:04.264
Let me know h-how I can help you.

39:04.299 --> 39:06.345
You can't.

39:06.742 --> 39:09.876
Like you said, I did what I did.

39:10.198 --> 39:12.643
I killed Ra's.

39:13.075 --> 39:15.742
I avenged my parents' death,
and guess what.

39:17.846 --> 39:19.713
Nothing changed.

39:23.443 --> 39:25.247
It made no difference.

39:25.454 --> 39:27.787
So then what did I do it for?

39:32.361 --> 39:34.561
How can you help that?

39:34.983 --> 39:37.564
I can help with the way
that you're feeling.

39:40.002 --> 39:41.968
But you need to talk to me.

39:43.672 --> 39:46.072
You have to face up
to who you really are.

39:46.108 --> 39:47.941
Stop telling me who I am.

39:49.945 --> 39:51.444
I know who I am.

39:54.116 --> 39:56.249
And if you really want to help me,

39:56.828 --> 39:58.585
you can stop trying to be my father,

39:58.620 --> 40:01.102
and you can be my butler.

40:01.323 --> 40:03.189
Clean this place up.

40:05.260 --> 40:06.960
Tommy!

40:29.484 --> 40:31.692
You're the hero of the day.

40:31.920 --> 40:33.486
I was just doing my job.

40:33.522 --> 40:35.722
I know you hate me

40:35.757 --> 40:38.091
for what I did,
but you deserve to be captain.

40:38.126 --> 40:39.726
I went to your father for help.

40:39.761 --> 40:41.895
I knew what I was getting into.

40:41.930 --> 40:43.897
Doesn't mean I have to like it.

40:43.932 --> 40:45.999
But you accept it.

40:48.170 --> 40:50.467
Because I do deserve it.

40:51.139 --> 40:53.920
Just like Gotham deserves law and order.

40:54.409 --> 40:56.976
And I'm gonna make sure it gets it.

40:58.613 --> 41:00.847
You don't think I want that, too?

41:03.385 --> 41:04.918
I'm not your enemy, Jim.

41:05.490 --> 41:07.295
I never will be.

41:43.105 --> 41:44.863
Did you find anything out?

41:50.532 --> 41:52.132
"I saw Sofia

41:52.416 --> 41:55.392
kissing the policeman."

41:59.241 --> 42:00.740
Is this true?

42:29.979 --> 42:32.238
Martin, you are a good friend.

42:37.379 --> 42:39.238
As for Sofia...

42:40.615 --> 42:43.416
she will answer for what she's done.

42:45.253 --> 42:46.920
I swear it.
