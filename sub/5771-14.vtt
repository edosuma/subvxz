EVERY GREAT LOVE STORY
HAS A BEGINNING.

I WANT YOU TO BE WITH ME.
I WANT ME TO BE
WITH YOU TOO.

00:09.343 --> 00:12.080

ALSO HAS AN END.

00:12.113 --> 00:13.514
WE CAN EITHER
BREAK UP NOW,

00:13.547 --> 00:15.216
OR WE CAN DO IT
THREE YEARS FROM NOW.

A FAVOR.

AND WHEN YOUR LOVE STORY ENDS,

00:18.786 --> 00:22.256
ALL YOU CAN DO IS CRY,
LISTEN TO SAD MUSIC,

AND DRINK WINE THAT YOU BOUGHT
FROM A GAS STATION.

HE DIDN'T CHEAT ON ME.
HE DIDN'T FLAKE AND BECOME A DJ.

01:47.875 --> 01:50.511
THE WORST THING HE EVER DID WAS
SUGGEST THAT WE EAT HEALTHIER.

01:50.544 --> 01:52.280
AND AS AWFUL AS THAT WAS,

01:52.313 --> 01:55.483
I DIDN'T APPRECIATE HIM

TO CALIFORNIA ONCE,

[laughs]

07:50.270 --> 07:51.672
SO I HAVE
A SOCCER GAME TOMORROW.

07:51.705 --> 07:52.806
CAN YOU COME?

07:52.840 --> 07:54.708
DANNY, YOU SHOULD GO.

07:54.742 --> 07:57.277
YOU KNOW, I CAN--I CAN DRIVE
MYSELF TO THE AIRPORT.

07:57.310 --> 07:59.279
UH...SURE.

07:59.312 --> 08:02.516
SOCCER GAME?
YEAH, I'LL GO.

08:02.550 --> 08:03.817
OKAY. DESSERT?

08:03.851 --> 08:06.253
LOVE DESSERT.

08:06.286 --> 08:07.988
(Mindy)
BYE!
BYE!

08:08.021 --> 08:10.257
THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME.
DANNY. DANNY.

08:10.290 --> 08:11.792
THEY ARE SO CUTE.

08:11.825 --> 08:13.260
THEY COULD HAVE
THEIR OWN REALITY SHOW.

08:13.293 --> 08:14.962
THE REAL HOUSE-CHILD
OF DESERT--

08:14.995 --> 08:16.229
YOU KNOW,
I'M NOT GOOD WITH NAMES.

08:16.263 --> 08:17.765
THAT'S SOMEONE ELSE'S--

08:17.798 --> 08:19.800
YEAH, YEAH, THEY'RE CUTE.
THEY'RE REALLY, UH--

08:19.833 --> 08:21.869
[can opens]
REALLY CUTE.

08:21.902 --> 08:23.103
HEY, MAYBE COOL IT
WITH THE BEERS, OKAY?

08:23.136 --> 08:24.772
YOU ALREADY HAD,
LIKE, THREE INSIDE.

08:24.805 --> 08:26.707
'CAUSE, YOU KNOW,
YOU'RE GONNA GET THE HICCUPS,

08:26.740 --> 08:27.875
AND I'M NOT GONNA BE THERE
TO SCARE YOU.

08:27.908 --> 08:29.777
I'M GOOD.
DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME.

08:29.810 --> 08:30.844
OKAY.

08:30.878 --> 08:33.146
WELL, WISH ME GOOD LUCK
WITH CLIFF.

08:33.180 --> 08:37.050
I'M GONNA TAKE A WALK,
AND, UH...

08:37.084 --> 08:39.653
YEAH.

08:39.687 --> 08:41.288
BE CAREFUL DRIVING.

08:41.321 --> 08:43.090
YOU'RE NOT VERY GOOD.

08:43.123 --> 08:45.826
ARE YOU SURE
YOU SHOULD BE HEAD--

08:45.859 --> 08:47.160
OKAY.

08:47.194 --> 08:50.097
(Cliff, singing along)
* I KNOW YOU LOVE ME

08:50.130 --> 08:54.735
* AND SOON YOU WILL SEE

08:57.905 --> 08:59.339
[sighs]

08:59.372 --> 09:02.342
IT'S BEEN THE SAME SONG
FOR TWO HOURS.

09:02.375 --> 09:03.877
I'M STARTING TO LOSE IT.

09:03.911 --> 09:07.581
WHY IS THIS GUY SO SAD?
WHAT, DID HIS GRANDMA DIE?

09:07.615 --> 09:09.683
[gasps]
GRANDMA'S DYING.

09:09.717 --> 09:10.851
NO, MY FRIEND.

09:10.884 --> 09:12.953
I'D KNOW THAT CRY ANYWHERE.

09:12.986 --> 09:15.589
THAT IS THE SOUND OF A MAN
WHO'S HAD HIS HEART BROKEN.

09:15.623 --> 09:16.690
HOW DO YOU KNOW?

09:16.724 --> 09:18.191
I WAS THAT GUY.

09:18.225 --> 09:20.027
WHEN BECCA LEFT ME,
I WAS A MESS.

09:20.060 --> 09:23.731
BUT MINDY AND CLIFF ARE DATING.
THERE'S NO REASON SHE--

09:23.764 --> 09:24.798
WHAT?

09:24.832 --> 09:26.867
DID MINDY DUMP CLIFF?

09:26.900 --> 09:28.702
DOES SHE THINK
SHE CAN DO BETTER?

09:28.736 --> 09:29.937
'CAUSE SHE CAN'T.
NO!

09:29.970 --> 09:31.204
NO GUY WANTS A CHICK
THAT'S SUCCESSFUL.

09:31.238 --> 09:32.673
YEAH, I HEARD THAT.

09:32.706 --> 09:34.074
OF COURSE YOU DID.
A-ROO!

09:34.107 --> 09:35.643
[barking]

09:35.676 --> 09:39.046
THIS IS OUR FAULT.
WE SET THEM UP.

09:39.079 --> 09:41.682
I ALREADY WROTE A TOAST
FOR THEIR WEDDING.

09:41.715 --> 09:44.685
"THE DICTIONARY DEFINES WEDDING
AS A GATHERING--"

09:44.718 --> 09:46.887
HOLD ON.

09:46.920 --> 09:49.156
HE STOPPED.

09:51.892 --> 09:53.961
IT STOPPED.
YES.

09:53.994 --> 09:55.963
(Cliff, high-pitched voice)
* DREAMS LAST FOR SO LONG

09:55.996 --> 09:57.130
I'M LOSING IT!
SHH.

09:57.164 --> 09:58.899
WE'RE GONNA DIE!
NO, NO. SHUT UP!

09:58.932 --> 09:59.933
SHUT UP!

09:59.967 --> 10:01.034
SHUT UP!
[screams]

10:01.068 --> 10:02.202
OH, MY GOD,
THANK GOD YOU'RE HERE!

10:02.235 --> 10:04.772
I KNEW THIS WAS
A GAY PICKUP SPOT.

10:04.805 --> 10:05.906
NO, IT'S NOT, DORIS.

10:05.939 --> 10:07.040
COME ON, LET'S GET
THE HELL OUT OF HERE

10:07.074 --> 10:08.341
BEFORE HE MAKES A BIG MISTAKE.

10:08.375 --> 10:10.177
I FEEL BAD.
SHOULD WE SAY SOMETHING?

10:10.210 --> 10:11.812
I GOT A DATE
I GOT TO TRY AND SALVAGE.

10:11.845 --> 10:13.914
I MEAN, WE ALL HAVE THINGS,
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

10:13.947 --> 10:16.950
I GOT A CARTON OF KITTENS AT
HOME THAT THINK I'M THEIR MOM.

10:16.984 --> 10:19.186
I'M THEIR DAD.

10:19.219 --> 10:21.288
HEY, CLIFF.
WHAT'S--WHAT'S UP, MAN?

10:21.321 --> 10:23.691
HEY...BRAH.

10:23.724 --> 10:26.994
GUYS.

10:27.027 --> 10:29.162
(Cliff)
YOU'VE REACHED CLIFF GILBERT.
PLEASE LEAVE A MESSAGE.

10:29.196 --> 10:30.230
[beep]

10:30.263 --> 10:32.065
LOOK, BABE, I WILL DO ANYTHING
TO WIN YOU BACK--

10:32.099 --> 10:34.034
LIKE, ANYTHING.
I WILL VACUUM.

10:34.067 --> 10:35.869
[incoming-call beep]
OH! HEY, BABE!

10:35.903 --> 10:37.170
I WAS JUST LEAVING YOU
A MESSAGE.

10:37.204 --> 10:38.939
LOOK, I WAS TELLING YOU
THAT I WOULD VACUUM,

10:38.972 --> 10:40.073
AND I DON'T KNOW
THAT I WOULD DO THAT.

10:40.107 --> 10:41.942
WHAT?
WHAT?

10:41.975 --> 10:43.043
DANNY?

10:43.076 --> 10:45.278
YES.
WHO'D YOU THINK IT WAS?

10:45.312 --> 10:46.680
CLIFF, OBVIOUSLY.

10:46.714 --> 10:48.682
OH, GIVE ME A BREAK
WITH CLIFF!

10:48.716 --> 10:51.018
I'M LOST IN THE DESERT
RIGHT NOW, AND I'M DRUNK.

10:51.051 --> 10:52.419
WHAT?
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

10:52.452 --> 10:53.754
I NEED YOU TO COME OUT HERE.

10:53.787 --> 10:54.955
YEAH, WELL, CALL YOUR DAD.

10:54.988 --> 10:56.690
I'M NOT CALLING
THAT SON OF A BITCH.

10:56.724 --> 10:58.926
I'D RATHER--RATHER DIE
HERE IN THE DESERT.

10:58.959 --> 11:00.060
I THINK
YOU'RE BEING DRAMATIC.

11:00.093 --> 11:03.196
I AM NOT BEING DRAMATIC!

11:03.230 --> 11:04.364
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

11:04.397 --> 11:05.833
NOTHING!
I'M FINE!

11:05.866 --> 11:07.034
YOU KNOW WHAT?
GO, GO, GO.

11:07.067 --> 11:08.869
I'LL FIGURE IT OUT ON MY OWN.
GOOD-BYE.

11:08.902 --> 11:11.905
[phone clicks]

11:11.939 --> 11:13.206
DAMN IT.

11:13.240 --> 11:15.242
[tires squealing]
YOU'VE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME.

11:15.275 --> 11:18.445
STUPID--STUPID DANNY.

11:20.480 --> 11:21.381
[elevator bell dings]

11:21.414 --> 11:24.417
SO, CLIFF, DO YOU GOT ANY PLANS
FOR TONIGHT?

11:24.451 --> 11:26.820
OH, YOU KNOW,
PROBABLY JUST...

11:26.854 --> 11:28.789
GET IN MY PJs AND...

11:28.822 --> 11:31.091
* HOP INTO BED

11:31.124 --> 11:35.996
* DREAMS LAST
SO LONG *

11:36.029 --> 11:38.265
HEY, CLIFF,
YOU OKAY, BUDDY?

11:38.298 --> 11:40.934
YEAH.

11:40.968 --> 11:43.837
* HEARTS ARE BROKEN
EVERY DAY *

11:43.871 --> 11:45.806
HEY, YOU'RE SINGING
A LOT OF JEWEL, MAN.

11:45.839 --> 11:47.808
MINDY AND I BROKE UP,
AND, UH...

11:47.841 --> 11:51.211
[elevator bell dings]
I'M TAKING IT PRETTY HARD.

11:51.244 --> 11:53.480
MAYBE YOU NEED
A GUYS' NIGHT OUT.

11:53.513 --> 11:54.982
YOU GUYS WANT
TO TAKE ME OUT?

11:55.015 --> 11:56.249
I DON'T KNOW.
OH, YEAH.

11:56.283 --> 11:57.484
I GOT A SEX DATE
WITH A TWO,

11:57.517 --> 11:59.319
WHICH MEANS
SHE'S A CHICAGO FOUR,

11:59.352 --> 12:00.921
WHICH MEANS
SHE'S A WISCONSIN NINE.

12:00.954 --> 12:02.255
I THINK
YOU CAN MOVE THAT AROUND...

12:02.289 --> 12:03.824
A LITTLE BIT.

12:03.857 --> 12:06.326
ALL RIGHT!
WHY NOT?
YEAH!

12:06.359 --> 12:08.328
I CAN HAVE MEANINGLESS SEX
ANY NIGHT OF THE WEEK,

12:08.361 --> 12:10.063
BUT I CAN'T IGNORE THE CALL

12:10.097 --> 12:11.398
OF A DUDE
WITH A BROKEN HEART.

12:11.431 --> 12:13.300
LET'S MAKE THIS A NIGHT
NOT TO REMEMBER, HUH?

12:13.333 --> 12:14.434
THREE, TWO, ONE...

12:14.467 --> 12:16.303
both:
BEST FRIENDS CLUB!

12:16.336 --> 12:17.437
I'LL GET IT
BY THE END OF THE NIGHT.

12:17.470 --> 12:19.873
THIS IS GONNA BE BAD.
YEAH, I KNOW.

12:21.108 --> 12:22.876
[whispering]
DANNY.

12:22.910 --> 12:24.277
DANNY!

12:24.311 --> 12:26.379
IF YOU'RE HERE,
PLEASE SAY SOMETHING, DANNY.

12:26.413 --> 12:27.781
MINDY!
OH, MY GOD!

12:27.815 --> 12:28.982
WHAT TOOK YOU SO LONG?

12:29.016 --> 12:30.350
WHAT TOOK ME SO LONG?

12:30.383 --> 12:31.451
YEAH.
OH, I DON'T KNOW.

12:31.484 --> 12:34.021
MAYBE IT WAS THE TWO-HOUR DRIVE
BACK FROM THE AIRPORT

12:34.054 --> 12:35.522
OR THE MILE THAT I WALKED
THROUGH THE DESERT.

12:35.555 --> 12:37.090
OKAY, IT'S VERY CONFUSING
OUT HERE.

12:37.124 --> 12:38.792
I WAS TRYING TO FOLLOW
THE BIG DIPPER,

12:38.826 --> 12:39.759
BUT I DON'T KNOW
WHAT IT MEANS.

12:39.793 --> 12:42.329
DANNY, YOU MADE ME MISS
ANOTHER FLIGHT, OKAY?

12:42.362 --> 12:43.997
I ALREADY PRE-ORDERED
MY SNACK.

12:44.031 --> 12:45.933
IT WAS A FIESTA SALAD WRAP--
MY FAVORITE!

12:45.966 --> 12:47.167
OKAY, RELAX.

12:47.200 --> 12:50.203
I THINK COMING TO SAVE ME IS
A LITTLE MORE IMPORTANT THAN...

12:50.237 --> 12:51.338
THAN WHAT?

12:51.371 --> 12:52.906
[sighs]
FORGET IT.

12:52.940 --> 12:53.941
NO. WHAT?

12:53.974 --> 12:56.143
THAN TO RUN HOME TO A GUY

12:56.176 --> 12:59.179
THAT CLEARLY DOESN'T WANT TO BE
WITH YOU ANYMORE.

12:59.212 --> 13:00.280
EXCUSE ME?

13:00.313 --> 13:02.182
YOU WANT A TIP?

13:02.215 --> 13:04.484
GUYS DON'T BREAK UP WITH GIRLS
THEY SECRETLY WANT TO BE WITH.

13:04.517 --> 13:05.518
THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN--

13:05.552 --> 13:08.021
MAYBE IN THE MOVIES,
BUT NOT IN REAL LIFE, OKAY?

13:08.055 --> 13:10.490
HE DUMPED YOU.
IT'S OVER. FORGET ABOUT IT.

13:10.523 --> 13:12.359
SORRY, SWEETHEART.

13:12.392 --> 13:14.294
YOU KNOW WHAT, DANNY?

13:14.327 --> 13:16.897
YEAH, WHAT?
WHEN I FIRST MET YOU...

13:16.930 --> 13:20.333
I THOUGHT, "WOW. THAT GUY IS
SO HANDSOME AND SMART.

13:20.367 --> 13:21.969
"HOW COULD HE BE SINGLE?

13:22.002 --> 13:23.871
HE'S SUCH A CATCH."

13:23.904 --> 13:26.339
THEN I GOT
TO KNOW YOU BETTER.

13:26.373 --> 13:30.077
AND I REALIZED...
YOU'RE MEAN.

13:30.110 --> 13:33.380
YEAH, YOU'RE MEAN,
AND YOU ARE SELFISH.

13:33.413 --> 13:36.149
AND YOU'RE
JUST LIKE YOUR DAD.

13:36.183 --> 13:38.151
NO, YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU'RE WORSE THAN YOUR DAD,

13:38.185 --> 13:41.321
'CAUSE YOUR DAD CHANGED.

13:41.354 --> 13:44.257
YOU KNOW WHAT? IT'S COLD.
LET'S JUST GET OUT OF HERE.

13:44.291 --> 13:45.292
FINE. LET'S GO.

13:45.325 --> 13:46.927
NO, DON'T WALK WITH ME.

13:46.960 --> 13:48.195
YOU WALK 20 FEET BEHIND ME.
WHA--

13:48.228 --> 13:50.297
AND EVERY SO OFTEN, WHISTLE THAT
SONG FROM THE HUNGER GAMES

13:50.330 --> 13:51.431
SO I KNOW YOU'RE NOT DEAD.

13:51.464 --> 13:53.233
[swallows hard]

13:53.266 --> 13:54.902
MM.

13:54.935 --> 13:56.303
HEY!

13:56.336 --> 13:58.872
WHAT IS MINDY THINKING?
WHAT A MORON FOR DUMPING YOU.

13:58.906 --> 14:00.340
OH, NO, MINDY
DIDN'T DUMP ME.

14:00.373 --> 14:02.275
NO, I ENDED IT
WITH MINDY.

14:02.309 --> 14:03.110
[burps]

14:03.143 --> 14:04.611
YOU DUMPED HER?
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

14:04.644 --> 14:06.479
WHAT, ARE YOU CRAZY?
WHY?

14:06.513 --> 14:08.548
WELL, I COULDN'T TRUST HER.

14:08.581 --> 14:12.485
I MEAN, SHE WENT TO A PARTY IN
LOS ANGELES WITH HER EX-FIANCE.

14:12.519 --> 14:16.023
I WAS AT THAT PARTY, DILLWEED.
NOTHING HAPPENED.

14:16.056 --> 14:17.190
SHE'S OBSESSED WITH YOU.

14:17.224 --> 14:18.225
YOU'RE ALL SHE TALKS ABOUT.

14:18.258 --> 14:20.260
I KNOW WHAT SIZE JEANS
YOU WEAR.

14:20.293 --> 14:21.628
AND I KNOW THAT
YOUR MOM'S NAME IS ELLEN,

14:21.661 --> 14:23.096
BUT HER FRIENDS
CALL HER "COOKIE."

14:23.130 --> 14:24.264
W-W-WAIT.

14:24.297 --> 14:25.165
D-D-DO YOU GUYS THINK
I MADE A MISTAKE?

14:25.198 --> 14:28.035
W-W-W-W-WAIT.
HOL--HOLD ON A SECOND, GUYS.

14:28.068 --> 14:30.503
OH, "DO YOU THINK I MADE A--"
YES, I THINK YOU MADE A MISTAKE!

14:30.537 --> 14:32.372
AGHH!
WAITER!

14:32.405 --> 14:35.308
I'D LIKE ANOTHER ORDER OF,
"YES, THIS GUY MADE A MISTAKE."

14:35.342 --> 14:36.609
I'M OUT OF HERE, MORGAN.
UNBELIEVABLE.

14:36.643 --> 14:38.345
WHERE YOU GOING?
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

14:38.378 --> 14:40.981
I BOUGHT YOU DRINKS
ON MY CREDIT CARD, MAN.

14:41.014 --> 14:42.315
YOU THINK I CAN AFFORD
SEVEN MOJITOS

14:42.349 --> 14:44.584
FOR A GUY WHO DID NOT
JUST GET DUMPED?

14:48.488 --> 14:50.357
[whistling]

14:50.390 --> 14:51.458
OH, MY GOD.

14:51.491 --> 14:53.226
THAT SOUNDS NOTHING LIKE RUE.

14:53.260 --> 14:54.694
HAVE YOU EVEN SEEN
HUNGER GAMES?

14:54.727 --> 14:57.230
[continues whistling]

14:57.264 --> 14:59.066
OH, LOOK...

14:59.099 --> 15:00.500
CIVILIZATION.

15:00.533 --> 15:02.069
WHAT THE HELL?

15:02.102 --> 15:03.403
THIS TOWN'S NOT ON THE MAP.

15:07.040 --> 15:08.308
IDENTIFICATIONS, PLEASE.

15:08.341 --> 15:09.977
OKAY, I KNOW THAT MY I.D.
SAYS THAT I AM 5'10"

15:10.010 --> 15:11.044
WITH BLONDE HAIR,

15:11.078 --> 15:12.946
110 POUNDS
WITH CRYSTAL BLUE EYES.

15:12.980 --> 15:16.283
MY PHILOSOPHY IS THAT AN I.D.
SHOULD BE ASPIRATIONAL.

15:16.316 --> 15:18.485
THAT'S VERY NICE,
MISS SILVERADO.

15:18.518 --> 15:22.089
OH. WELL, THANK YOU
FOR YOUR SERVICE TO OUR COUNTRY.

15:22.122 --> 15:23.323
SILVERADO?

15:23.356 --> 15:24.491
CASTELLANO?

15:24.524 --> 15:27.094
ARE YOU RELATED
TO ALAN CASTELLANO?

15:27.127 --> 15:29.129
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.
UNFORTUNATELY I AM.

15:29.162 --> 15:31.731
OH, MAN, ALAN CUTS
ALL THE BOYS' HAIR ON THE BASE.

15:31.764 --> 15:33.967
THAT'S GREAT.
WHY DON'T YOU JUST
GIVE HIM A CALL?

15:34.001 --> 15:35.335
HAVE HIM COME PICK YOU UP.

15:37.404 --> 15:38.638
THIS IS VERY HARD FOR HIM

15:38.671 --> 15:40.040
BECAUSE HE HAS A VERY
COMPLICATED RELATIONSHIP

15:40.073 --> 15:41.041
WITH HIS FATHER.

15:41.074 --> 15:42.375
OH.

15:42.409 --> 15:44.077
HE WAS ABANDONED AS A CHILD,
AND SO NOW HE FEELS--

15:44.111 --> 15:46.746
OKAY, OKAY.
I'M GONNA DO IT.

15:46.779 --> 15:48.515
[whispering]
IT'S PRETTY MESSED UP.

15:50.083 --> 15:53.086
I CAN'T IMAGINE THAT PHONE CALL
WAS EASY FOR YOU TO MAKE.

15:53.120 --> 15:55.755
YEAH, THANKS
FOR SHOWING UP.

15:55.788 --> 15:58.591
I GUESS THERE'S A FIRST TIME
FOR EVERYTHING, RIGHT?

15:58.625 --> 16:00.293
COME ON, DANNY.

16:00.327 --> 16:02.195
YEAH. WHAT DO YOU WANT TO HEAR?
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

16:02.229 --> 16:04.431
YOU WANT TO HEAR IT WAS HARD?
YEAH, IT WAS HARD.

16:04.464 --> 16:06.066
THE WHOLE THING'S BEEN HARD.

16:06.099 --> 16:07.400
BUT, YOU KNOW,
I WANTED TO SHOW UP HERE,

16:07.434 --> 16:09.069
I WANTED TO SHOW UP,
AND I WANTED TO...

16:09.102 --> 16:12.172
[groans]
I WANTED TO KNOCK
YOU OUT, MAN...

16:12.205 --> 16:16.076
[sighs]
AND BE DONE WITH YOU, BUT...

16:17.744 --> 16:20.713
IT TURNS OUT
YOU'RE A GOOD DAD NOW.

16:20.747 --> 16:22.515
WHEN DID THAT HAPPEN?

16:22.549 --> 16:25.185
DANNY, I'M REALLY SORRY.

16:25.218 --> 16:27.087
OH, YOU'RE SORRY.
NOW--YOU'RE SORRY NOW?

16:27.120 --> 16:29.089
I WASN'T AROUND.

16:29.122 --> 16:32.025
I NEVER CAME TO ANY ONE
OF YOUR DANCE CONCERTS.

16:32.059 --> 16:34.061
NO, NO, NO.
YOU MEAN MY LITTLE LEAGUE, OKAY?

16:34.094 --> 16:35.295
MY LITTLE LEAGUE.

16:35.328 --> 16:37.097
NO. YOU REMEMBER.

16:37.130 --> 16:39.166
YOU USED TO PRACTICE
THOSE PIROUETTES IN THE KITCHEN

16:39.199 --> 16:41.068
BECAUSE THE LINOLEUM
MADE IT EASIER TO SPIN.

16:41.101 --> 16:42.302
SHH, SHH.

16:42.335 --> 16:44.171
I DON'T WANT THE WHOLE BASE
TO KNOW I WAS A PRIMO BALLERINO.

16:44.204 --> 16:46.106
YOU WERE SO GRACEFUL.

16:46.139 --> 16:47.374
I WAS?

16:47.407 --> 16:50.543
DANNY, I CAN'T CHANGE
THE PAST, OKAY?

16:50.577 --> 16:51.811
BUT YOU?

16:51.844 --> 16:53.680
YOU CAN BE A PART
OF LITTLE DANNY'S FUTURE.

16:53.713 --> 16:55.182
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT.

16:55.215 --> 16:57.217
DANNY, I WANT YOU
TO BE PART OF THE FAMILY.

16:59.752 --> 17:01.121
PLEASE.

17:01.154 --> 17:02.255
(Mindy)
UM, I HAVE A QUESTION.

17:02.289 --> 17:05.225
HOW CLOSE DO YOU THINK YOU ARE
TO FINDING BIN LADEN?

17:05.258 --> 17:06.626
WHAT?

17:06.659 --> 17:08.295
WELL, I'M ASKING BECAUSE I FEEL
LIKE I SEE HIM EVERY DAY

17:08.328 --> 17:09.829
IN MANHATTAN.

17:09.862 --> 17:11.831
D-DON'T YOU--
NO.

17:11.864 --> 17:13.633
I'M NOT SEEING HIM.
WE'RE GONNA GET OUT OF HERE.

17:13.666 --> 17:15.368
I WANT TO THANK YOU.
SURE.

17:15.402 --> 17:16.636
IT'S JUST--WHY--

17:16.669 --> 17:18.771
THANK YOU, SIR.
SALUTE HIM, SALUTE HIM.

17:18.805 --> 17:21.174
GOD, THIS KNOT IS INSANE.

17:21.208 --> 17:22.409
SO WHAT'S
YOUR BOYFRIEND LIKE?

17:22.442 --> 17:24.844
IS HE CUTE LIKE LIAM
FROM ONE DIRECTION?

17:24.877 --> 17:26.413
LIAM FROM ONE DIRECTION?

17:26.446 --> 17:28.181
UH, MORE LIKE HARRY
FROM ONE DIRECTION.

17:28.215 --> 17:30.850
HERE, CHECK HIM OUT.

17:30.883 --> 17:32.119
PRETTY BANGIN', HUH?

17:32.152 --> 17:33.353
HE DOESN'T LOOK LIKE HARRY.

17:33.386 --> 17:35.155
OBVIOUSLY.
IT'S HARRY STYLES.

17:35.188 --> 17:37.224
NO ONE LOOKS LIKE--
BUT HE'S...

17:37.257 --> 17:39.192
HE'S MAD AT ME, THOUGH.
WHY?

17:39.226 --> 17:40.793
DID YOU BRING HOME
A LITTLE SNAKE

17:40.827 --> 17:42.095
AND HIDE IT IN YOUR ROOM?

17:42.129 --> 17:44.764
NO, I WAS THE SNAKE.

17:44.797 --> 17:46.333
AND NOW I HAVE
TO GO APOLOGIZE TO HIM,

17:46.366 --> 17:48.101
BUT I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO SAY TO HIM.

17:48.135 --> 17:49.569
I HAD TO APOLOGIZE
TO MY NEIGHBOR

17:49.602 --> 17:50.870
WHEN THE SNAKE BIT HER.

17:50.903 --> 17:52.305
I WROTE HER A NICE LETTER.

17:52.339 --> 17:55.408
WRITE CLIFF A LETTER.

17:55.442 --> 17:57.744
LITTLE DANNY,
THAT IS A GOOD IDEA.

17:57.777 --> 17:59.112
OF COURSE,

17:59.146 --> 18:00.780
BECAUSE IT CAME FROM THE MOUTH
OF A WEE BABE.

18:00.813 --> 18:02.615
[laughs]
THANK YOU.

18:02.649 --> 18:04.651
YOU KNOW WHAT? CAN YOU GO
SNEAK ME ONE OF THE POPSICLES?

18:04.684 --> 18:05.652
THE MOMS ARE ONTO ME.

18:05.685 --> 18:07.420
WHAT'S YOUR FAVORITE FLAVOR?
RED.

18:07.454 --> 18:09.156
RED. GOT IT.

18:09.189 --> 18:11.724
GET A BLUE AND A GREEN
JUST IN CASE.

18:16.629 --> 18:18.131
(Mindy)
DANNY? DANNY.

18:18.165 --> 18:20.833
I'M NOT GONNA GET UP AGAIN
SO YOU CAN WALK THE AISLES.

18:20.867 --> 18:22.502
YOU'RE NOT GONNA
GET THROMBOSIS.

18:22.535 --> 18:23.803
I DON'T CARE WHAT
THE TOD SHOW SAYS.

18:23.836 --> 18:25.172
I DON'T CARE.
NO, IT'S NOT THAT.

18:25.205 --> 18:28.141
I WANT TO APOLOGIZE.

18:28.175 --> 18:31.244
IT TOOK A LOT FOR YOU
TO MAKE PEACE WITH YOUR DAD.

18:31.278 --> 18:33.913
I MEAN, YOU DID IT IN
A COMPLETELY MELODRAMATIC WAY.

18:33.946 --> 18:35.882
I COULD'VE DONE WITHOUT
WANDERING AROUND THE DESERT.

18:35.915 --> 18:37.384
I SAT ON AN ARMADILLO,
KILLED IT.

18:37.417 --> 18:39.152
THAT WAS NOT GOOD
FOR MY SELF-ESTEEM.

18:39.186 --> 18:40.353
BUT...

18:40.387 --> 18:43.523
YOU'RE NOT MEAN.
YOU'RE GREAT.

18:43.556 --> 18:45.858
HEY.

18:45.892 --> 18:46.793
[sighs]

18:46.826 --> 18:49.529
AND I'M SORRY ABOUT
WHAT I SAID ABOUT CLIFF.

18:49.562 --> 18:50.863
YOU WEREN'T LUCKY
TO BE WITH HIM.

18:50.897 --> 18:52.299
HE WAS LUCKY
TO BE WITH YOU.

18:53.800 --> 18:55.335
HOW'S THAT LETTER GOING?

18:55.368 --> 18:56.536
CAN I READ YOU
THE FIRST PART?

18:56.569 --> 18:57.670
SURE.
[clears throat]

18:57.704 --> 18:58.938
"DEAR CLIFF,

18:58.971 --> 19:01.274
"I'M SO SORRY
FOR WHAT I DID.

19:01.308 --> 19:03.543
IT'S JUST THAT CASEY AND I
HAD A SEXUAL CHEMISTRY--"

19:03.576 --> 19:05.345
NO, NO.
THAT--THAT'S NOT GOOD.

19:05.378 --> 19:06.846
OKAY, CAN I HELP YOU?
OKAY.

19:06.879 --> 19:08.181
OKAY.

19:08.215 --> 19:09.316
[sighs]

19:09.349 --> 19:10.450
HOW ABOUT SOMETHING
LIKE THIS?

19:10.483 --> 19:12.485
"DEAR CLIFF,
PLEASE FORGIVE ME.

19:12.519 --> 19:15.722
I'M SORRY I WAS SO STUPID
AND RECKLESS WITH YOUR HEART."

19:15.755 --> 19:16.823
OH, MY GOD.

19:16.856 --> 19:18.725
OKAY, KEEP IT COMING,
LITTLE SHAKESPEARE.
OKAY.

19:18.758 --> 19:19.859
"YOU KNOW YOU'RE RIGHT
FOR SOMEONE

19:19.892 --> 19:24.364
"WHEN THEY FORCE YOU TO BE
THE BEST VERSION OF YOURSELF.

19:24.397 --> 19:26.599
THAT'S HOW I KNOW WE'RE RIGHT
FOR EACH OTHER, CLIFF."

19:26.633 --> 19:28.901
THIS IS AMAZING.

19:28.935 --> 19:31.571
ALL RIGHT,
HERE GOES NOTHING.

19:31.604 --> 19:32.605
AND...

19:32.639 --> 19:34.541
[tablet chimes]
[sighs]

19:40.513 --> 19:44.584
[phone chimes]

19:44.617 --> 19:47.254
(Mindy)
"DEAR CLIFF,
PLEASE FORGIVE ME.

19:47.287 --> 19:48.588
"I'M SO SORRY.

19:48.621 --> 19:50.590
I WAS STUPID AND RECKLESS
WITH YOUR HEART."

19:57.430 --> 19:58.998
[phone ringing]

19:59.031 --> 20:01.968
OH, GOD.
UM...

20:02.001 --> 20:03.270
HELLO?

20:03.303 --> 20:04.871
(Cliff)
MORGAN? I THOUGHT ABOUT IT.

20:04.904 --> 20:06.573
I NEED TO GET MINDY BACK.

20:06.606 --> 20:08.308
YEAH, YOU DO!

20:08.341 --> 20:09.809
WHO AM I SPEAKING TO?

20:09.842 --> 20:10.710
IT'S CLIFF.

20:10.743 --> 20:12.779
(Peter)
YOU TAP THAT, CLIFF.

20:12.812 --> 20:17.517
YOU TAP THAT
INTO THE SUNSET.

20:17.550 --> 20:18.818
I WI--
[phone clicks, dial tone]

20:18.851 --> 20:22.755
HELLO?

20:22.789 --> 20:26.626
HEY, I REALLY APPRECIATE THIS.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

20:26.659 --> 20:28.761
AND AS PAYMENT,
ONE TONIC WATER.

20:31.864 --> 20:33.933
THANKS.
I WILL BE RIGHT BACK.

20:33.966 --> 20:36.869
ALL RIGHT.

20:41.808 --> 20:43.543
[bang, plane rumbling]

20:47.314 --> 20:50.317
[intercom chimes]

20:58.024 --> 21:00.993
OH, BROTHER.

21:02.462 --> 21:03.596
[sighs]

21:03.630 --> 21:04.997
HEY.

21:05.031 --> 21:06.733
HEY, DANNY, ALL THESE WATERS
LOOK THE SAME.

21:06.766 --> 21:08.535
I-I JUST DON'T--

21:34.994 --> 21:38.030
WHEN I FIRST MET YOU, I THOUGHT
YOU WERE A SCREECHY HEAD CASE.

21:38.064 --> 21:39.499
COME ON, DANNY.
YEAH.

21:39.532 --> 21:41.334
WE GET IT, DANNY.
YOU'RE SO MUCH SMARTER THAN US.

21:41.368 --> 21:42.535
I AM, THOUGH.

21:42.569 --> 21:43.870
JUST TELL THEM
THAT I'M NOT SOME CRAZY PERVERT.

21:43.903 --> 21:45.438
I MEAN,
I'M NOT GONNA LIE TO THEM.

21:45.472 --> 21:46.839
DANNY, YOU ARE SO SELFISH!

21:46.873 --> 21:47.940
(Danny)
THEN YOU BECAME MORE TOLERABLE,

21:47.974 --> 21:49.876
AND WE'RE GOOD, RIGHT?

21:53.012 --> 21:54.914
YOU'RE A WOMAN, AND THAT'S GOOD.
LOOK LIKE A WOMAN.

21:54.947 --> 21:56.749
OKAY.

22:01.921 --> 22:04.056
(man)
GO TO BED.
