WEBVTT

00:06.333 --> 00:08.300
( theme music playing )

00:13.600 --> 00:17.900
LARRY! GOD, LARRY,
COME ON, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
WE'RE LATE FOR THE BARBECUE.

00:17.933 --> 00:19.533
- OH, OKAY.
- MARK AND MARLA
ARE GOING TO--

00:19.567 --> 00:22.500
- I'M ALL READY.
- OKAY, ALL RIGHT.

00:24.167 --> 00:26.333
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
- I'M GETTING A JACKET.

00:26.367 --> 00:27.967
- OH, YOU'RE NOT GOING
TO NEED A JACKET.
- NO, I AM--

00:28.000 --> 00:29.433
IT'S AT THE BEACH--

00:29.467 --> 00:32.367
NO, IT GETS CHILLY
AT NIGHT AT THE BEACH,
ARE YOU KIDDING?

00:32.400 --> 00:34.067
THERE'LL BE A FIRE.
WHY ARE YOU WEARING
CORDUROYS?

00:34.100 --> 00:36.433
I'LL LEAVE IT IN THE CAR.
WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?

00:36.467 --> 00:38.667
I THINK YOU'RE JUST
A LITTLE OVERDRESSED.

00:38.700 --> 00:39.967
ALL YOU NEED ARE
FLIP-FLOPS AND JEANS.

00:40.000 --> 00:42.300
YOU KNOW THE STORY
OF THE THREE LITTLE PIGS,

00:42.333 --> 00:44.000
THE ONE WHO BUILT
HIS HOUSE WITH BRICKS?

00:44.033 --> 00:45.767
- YES.
- THAT'S ME.

00:45.800 --> 00:47.300
- OKAY.
- I BUILD MY HOUSE
WITH BRICKS.

00:47.333 --> 00:48.500
I BUILD MY HOUSE
WITH BRICKS.

00:48.533 --> 00:50.600
- AND BY THE WAY--
- I'M THE THIRD PIG.

00:50.633 --> 00:52.567
- WHEN WE GET THERE--
- THINK OF ME THAT WAY,
THE THIRD PIG.

00:52.600 --> 00:54.367
I WILL THINK OF YOU
AS THE THIRD PIG.

00:54.400 --> 00:57.267
WHEN WE GET THERE,
WILL YOU PLEASE
APOLOGIZE TO MARK

00:57.300 --> 00:59.667
FOR THE WAY YOU TREATED HIM
AT THE SEDER?

00:59.700 --> 01:02.133
- I TOLD YOU--
- ACCUSING HIM OF STEALING
YOUR NEWSPAPERS?

01:02.167 --> 01:04.067
I ALREADY APOLOGIZED
TO HIM, I TOLD YOU THAT.

01:04.067 --> 01:07.067
I'M STILL NOT
CONVINCED HE DIDN'T TAKE IT.
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THAT?

01:08.533 --> 01:12.067
( all laughing, talking )

01:19.533 --> 01:20.867
Cheryl:
...SCARED TO GO TO BED

01:20.900 --> 01:23.333
'CAUSE THE FREAKS AT DUPONT
MIGHT GET OUT OF THE CAVE.

01:23.367 --> 01:25.267
I DON'T KNOW
HOW YOU CAN EAT
THIS THING, REALLY.

01:25.300 --> 01:27.067
- YOU WANT A BITE?
- HUH?

01:27.067 --> 01:29.633
WHY DON'T YOU JUST
BURN EVERYTHING YOU EAT
TO A CINDER?

01:29.667 --> 01:30.967
WHY STOP
AT THE MARSHMALLOW?

01:31.067 --> 01:33.200
- Mark: AW, COME ON...
- THEY'RE TOASTING.

01:33.233 --> 01:34.967
- IT'S A LIGHT TOASTING.
- DOESN'T MATTER.

01:35.067 --> 01:37.167
IT'S THE SITUATION.
WE'RE SITTING AROUND
A CAMPFIRE.

01:37.200 --> 01:38.667
- THAT'S WHY WE'RE DOING THIS.
- Mark: IT'S A FUN--

01:38.700 --> 01:41.667
I DON'T WANT TO SPOIL YOUR FUN.
YOU'RE HAVING A GOOD TIME.

01:41.700 --> 01:43.800
I'M JUST SAYING
IT'S IDIOTIC WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

01:43.833 --> 01:46.500
- TRY THIS ONE. TRY ONE.
- NO, IT DOESN'T TASTE GOOD.
I DON'T WANT IT.

01:46.533 --> 01:48.233
THANK YOU
FOR YOUR OPINION, LARRY.

01:48.267 --> 01:50.067
THAT'S A PERFECT
FIRE I BUILT.

01:50.067 --> 01:52.267
WHOSE IDEA WAS IT
TO HAVE S'MORES
TONIGHT?

01:52.300 --> 01:53.467
HE CAN'T HANDLE THE TRUTH.

01:53.500 --> 01:55.800
- I'M COLD. I'M GONNA
GET MY JACKET.
- WHAT?

01:55.833 --> 01:58.667
- LOVE THOSE S'MORES.
- HE SHOULD JUST TRY IT.

01:58.700 --> 02:00.467
ANOTHER PERFECT ONE.
WHO'S READY?

02:18.667 --> 02:20.467
Cheryl:
WHO DRANK ALL THE BEER?

02:20.500 --> 02:22.433
SOMEBODY'S BEEN
DRINKING ALL THE BEER.

02:22.467 --> 02:23.900
- HEY.
- HEY.

02:23.933 --> 02:25.733
MY JACKET'S
NOT IN THE CAR.

02:28.767 --> 02:31.300
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
- DIDN'T I PUT THE JACKET
IN THE CAR?

02:31.333 --> 02:33.133
YOU SAID THAT
YOU BROUGHT IT
WITH YOU.

02:33.167 --> 02:35.433
- I BROUGHT IT WITH ME,
IN THE BACK SEAT, RIGHT?
- YES.

02:35.467 --> 02:38.200
AND I LOOKED
IN THE FRONT SEAT
AND THE TRUNK.

02:38.233 --> 02:40.133
- THAT'S REALLY STRANGE.
- HUH?

02:40.167 --> 02:42.133
THAT'S BIZARRE.

02:43.467 --> 02:45.967
'CAUSE I KNOW
YOU BROUGHT IT.

02:46.067 --> 02:47.933
'CAUSE I MADE FUN
OF YOU.

02:47.967 --> 02:50.067
WHAT, WHAT ARE YOU
LOOKING AT?

02:52.367 --> 02:55.433
THAT'S MY JACKET.

02:55.467 --> 02:57.067
MARLA'S WEARING MY JACKET.

02:57.100 --> 02:59.667
SHE TOOK MY JACKETFROM THE CAR?

02:59.700 --> 03:01.200
WHAT IS THAT?

03:01.233 --> 03:04.100
MAYBE SHE WAS
WALKING BY AND SAW IT
IN THE BACK SEAT.

03:04.133 --> 03:06.467
BUT YOU DON'T GO
INTO SOMEONE'S CAR
AND TAKE THEIR COAT.

03:06.500 --> 03:09.867
- SHE JUST
GRABBED IT, SHE WAS COLD.
- IT'S NOT HER COAT THOUGH.

03:09.900 --> 03:12.867
OKAY, WELL, IT'S NOT
A BIG DEAL. LET'S NOT
MAKE IT A BIG DEAL.

03:12.900 --> 03:14.767
EVERYONE?

03:14.800 --> 03:17.500
- UH, WE HAVE
AN ANNOUNCEMENT.
- Marla: YEAH.

03:17.533 --> 03:19.467
WE WANT YOU GUYS

03:19.500 --> 03:21.600
TO CLEAR YOUR CALENDARS

03:21.633 --> 03:23.700
AND HOLD THE DATE
OF THE 14TH

03:23.733 --> 03:27.067
AND COME BACK HERE
WHERE WE'RE GOING
TO BE GETTING MARRIED.

03:27.067 --> 03:28.833
- OH MY GOD!

03:28.867 --> 03:31.133
CONGRATULATIONS.

03:31.167 --> 03:34.333
Cheryl:
OH MY GOD,
THAT IS SO GREAT.

03:34.367 --> 03:36.333
- OH, THANKS.

03:36.367 --> 03:39.067

03:41.367 --> 03:43.633
CONGRATULATIONS!

03:43.667 --> 03:45.567
THAT'S GREAT--
GREAT NEWS.

03:45.600 --> 03:47.133
I MEAN IT JUST
COULDN'T HAVE BEEN
MORE PERFECT.

03:47.167 --> 03:50.633
YEAH, GOOD, GOOD.
( inhales )

03:50.667 --> 03:53.900
BRR.

03:53.933 --> 03:55.733
WHEW!

03:55.767 --> 03:57.733
- WE'RE JUST HAPPY.
- IT'S COLD.

04:01.700 --> 04:03.533
WHERE DID YOU GET THAT JACKET?

04:03.567 --> 04:07.367
OH, I GOT IT
FROM ONE OF THE CARS.

04:07.400 --> 04:11.067
OH, OKAY.
OKAY, NO WONDER--

04:11.067 --> 04:13.967
- I WAS JUST SO COLD.
- YEAH, 'CAUSE...

04:14.067 --> 04:15.567
YEAH, 'CAUSE THAT'S--

04:15.600 --> 04:18.333
YOU GOT IT FROM MY CAR.
THAT'S ACTUALLY MY JACKET.

04:18.367 --> 04:19.967
( gasps ) OH.

04:20.067 --> 04:22.633
I'M SORRY. I'M SORRY.
I WAS SO COLD.

04:22.667 --> 04:24.967
YEAH, ME TOO.
THAT'S WHY I WENT TO THE CAR
TO GET THE JACKET.

04:25.067 --> 04:26.667
'CAUSE I'M-- I'M FREEZING
AND EVERYTHING.

04:26.700 --> 04:28.767
- WELL, THANK YOU.
- EH.

04:28.800 --> 04:31.600
- ( fire crackles )
- 'CAUSE EARLIER IN FACT,

04:31.633 --> 04:34.300
BEFORE WE CAME,
I WAS TAKING THE COAT

04:34.333 --> 04:36.700
AND CHERYL WAS MOCKING ME
FOR WEARING A COAT,

04:36.733 --> 04:38.533
'CAUSE IT'S FREEZING,
YOU KNOW.

04:38.567 --> 04:41.167
I'M NOT GONNA TAKE A COAT--
WHAT, AM I NUTS?

04:41.200 --> 04:43.133
I HAD THE FORESIGHT

04:43.167 --> 04:45.833
TO BRING THE COAT.

04:45.867 --> 04:47.567
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
'CAUSE I KNEW

04:47.600 --> 04:50.200
IT'S THE BEACH,
IT GETS CHILLY ON THE BEACH.

04:50.233 --> 04:52.667
- YOU KNOW...
- BRING A JACKET.

04:52.700 --> 04:54.467
- BRING A JACKET.
- RIGHT.

04:54.500 --> 04:57.833
YOU KNOW, SO I BROUGHT
THE JACKET AND...

04:57.867 --> 05:00.467
AND I WAS SMART, YOU KNOW,
TO BRING THE JACKET.

05:04.133 --> 05:06.600
LARRY, DO YOU WANT
THE JACKET BACK?

05:10.067 --> 05:12.100
EH, OH... OKAY.

05:12.133 --> 05:13.300
HERE YOU GO.

05:13.333 --> 05:16.367
- ARE YOU SURE?
- IT-IT DID ITS JOB, TRULY.

05:16.400 --> 05:19.500
- YOU SURE?
- YEAH, YOU TAKE IT BACK.

05:19.533 --> 05:22.500
ALL RIGHT, OKAY, OKAY.

05:24.067 --> 05:25.667
WOW!

05:25.700 --> 05:27.900
WOWIE.
BETTER?

05:27.933 --> 05:29.900
WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?
WHAT IS THAT?

05:29.933 --> 05:32.267
OH...

05:32.300 --> 05:34.067
- IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN...
- WHAT IS THAT?

05:34.067 --> 05:36.367
- I WAS EATING A S'MORE--
- IS THAT A S'MORE?

05:36.400 --> 05:38.367
IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN.
I WAS EATING IT,
IT'S CHOC--

05:38.400 --> 05:39.700
BUT IT'LL WASH OUT,
IT'S FLEECE.

05:39.733 --> 05:41.467
OH MY GOD.
THAT'S NOT GONNA WASH OUT.

05:41.500 --> 05:43.567
- LOOK AT THAT.
- WELL, SURE--

05:43.600 --> 05:46.233
I'LL TAKE THE JACKET
WITH ME. I CAN WASH IT.
IT'LL BE FINE.

05:48.067 --> 05:50.400
- I'D BE HAPPY
TO BUY YOU A NEW JACKET.
- I SEE S'MORES,

05:50.433 --> 05:52.233
I CAN'T STAND THEM.
I DON'T KNOW HOW...

05:52.267 --> 05:54.200
I-I DON'T KNOW WHAT
PEOPLE EAT THEM FOR.

05:56.233 --> 05:58.233
Cheryl:
SO SOMEBODY BORROWS
YOUR JACKET,

05:58.267 --> 06:02.200
IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL.
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

06:02.233 --> 06:05.467
YOU MOVE ON.
YOU DON'T WORRY ABOUT.
YOU DON'T THINK ABOUT IT.

06:06.733 --> 06:09.367
HOW COULD I SIT THERE
FREEZING TO DEATH

06:09.400 --> 06:11.533
WHILE SHE'S WEARING
MY JACKET?

06:11.567 --> 06:15.100
IT'S NOT LIKE THERE'S
SOMETHING WRONG WITH HER
AND SHE'S GOT AN ILLNESS

06:15.133 --> 06:17.067
WHERE SHE REALLY NEEDS
THE JACKET.

06:17.067 --> 06:18.533
YOU DON'T HAVE
AN ILLNESS EITHER--

06:18.567 --> 06:21.900
SHE'S A PERFECTLY HEALTHY
WOMAN WEARING MY JACKET,
I'M FREEZING.

06:21.933 --> 06:25.267
LARRY, THEY GOT ENGAGED
TONIGHT, OKAY?

06:25.300 --> 06:27.600
THIS WAS NOT ABOUT YOU.

06:27.633 --> 06:30.833
IT WAS NOT ABOUT
YOUR STUPID JACKET.
THEY GOT ENGAGED.

06:30.867 --> 06:32.533
YEAH, THAT'S TRUE.

06:32.567 --> 06:33.933
WHY WOULD YOU EVEN
SAY THAT?

06:33.967 --> 06:35.100
- 'CAUSE I WAS COLD.
- WELL, SO WAS SHE.

06:35.133 --> 06:37.767
WELL THEN, SHE SHOULD HAVE
BROUGHT HER OWN JACKET.

06:37.800 --> 06:41.200
I WAS THE ONLY ONE
WHO ANTICIPATED THAT IT WAS
GOING TO BE COLD.

06:41.233 --> 06:44.700
AND I SHOULD BE REWARDED
FOR THAT FORESIGHT,
NOT PUNISHED.

06:44.733 --> 06:49.200
YOU KNOW WHAT? THIS IS
REALLY-- IT'S A SERIOUS THING
FOR THEM TO GET ENGAGED.

06:49.233 --> 06:51.200
I DID NOT ASK HER DIRECTLY
FOR THE JACKET.

06:51.233 --> 06:54.333
IF I SAY
DON'T SAY ANYTHING,

06:54.367 --> 06:55.900
DO YOU KNOW
WHAT THAT MEANS?

06:55.933 --> 06:58.167
YES YES, MOM, YEAH.

06:58.200 --> 07:00.200
- MOM SAYS--
- I FEEL LIKE YOU DON'T
KNOW WHAT IT MEANS.

07:00.233 --> 07:02.500
IF MOM SAYS, "DON'T SAY--"
I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING.

07:02.533 --> 07:05.200
YOU KNOW HOW YOU SAID
THAT YOU WERE THE SMART PIG?

07:05.233 --> 07:07.567
- YEAH, THE SMART
PIG-- EXACTLY, YEAH.
- THAT MADE HIS HOUSE OF--

07:07.600 --> 07:10.667
BUT THE THING ABOUT
THE SMART PIG THAT MADE
HIS HOUSE OF BRICKS,

07:10.700 --> 07:13.367
HE PROTECTED
THE OTHER LITTLE PIGS
THAT CAME OVER.

07:13.400 --> 07:16.100
OKAY?
HE WATCHED OVER THEM
AND HELPED THEM,

07:16.133 --> 07:18.967
'CAUSE HE WAS
A GENEROUS PIG.

07:19.067 --> 07:22.367
YEAH... THE PIG ALSO
DIDN'T COME HOME

07:22.400 --> 07:24.533
TO FIND SOME OTHER
FUCKING PIG

07:24.567 --> 07:27.600
LIVING IN HIS HOUSE
WHILE HE WAS LOCKED OUT.

07:30.333 --> 07:32.267
( birds chirping )

07:32.300 --> 07:34.800
Larry:
IF THE JACKET WERE
BIG ENOUGH FOR TWO PEOPLE...

07:34.833 --> 07:37.667
- I KNOW.
- I WOULD'VE SHARED IT
LIKE THE PIG DID.

07:37.700 --> 07:39.800
PIG?

07:39.833 --> 07:42.800
THE PIG-- "THE THREE
LITTLE PIGS," YOU DON'T
KNOW THAT STORY?

07:42.833 --> 07:44.600
WHAT PIG?
I DON'T KNOW WHAT PIG IS.

07:44.633 --> 07:45.733
YOU KNOW,
"THE THREE LITTLE PIGS."

07:45.767 --> 07:48.300
ONE BUILT-- THE WOLF
WAS AFTER THE PIGS.

07:48.333 --> 07:50.300
ONE BUILT HIS HOUSE
WITH BRICKS.

07:50.333 --> 07:52.100
I'M THE PIG
WITH THE BRICKS.

07:52.133 --> 07:53.667
WHEN DID IT HAPPEN?
IN THE NEWS?

07:53.700 --> 07:55.067
NO, THIS IS A FAIRY TALE.

07:55.067 --> 07:57.500
- NOT REAL?
- YEAH, IT'S NOT REAL.

07:57.533 --> 07:58.833
- OH.
- YEAH.

07:58.867 --> 08:01.267
ALL RIGHT, SO WHAT--
WHAT DO I OWE YOU?
I OWE YOU MONEY.

08:01.300 --> 08:03.633
- 300.
- 300.

08:03.667 --> 08:06.833
CAN YOU BELIEVE
I BET THE CLIPPERS?
WHAT KIND OF MORON AM I?

08:06.867 --> 08:09.867
THAT IS YOUR FAULT, NOT MINE.
I SAID DON'T, YOU DID IT.

08:09.900 --> 08:13.300
- HAVE I EVER WON
ON THE CLIPPERS, HUH?
- NEVER, NEVER, MMM-MM.

08:13.333 --> 08:15.233
A JERK.

08:15.267 --> 08:17.467
OKAY, ON TUESDAY--

08:17.500 --> 08:19.633
MMM.

08:19.667 --> 08:21.667
- I THINK, UH...
- YES?

08:21.700 --> 08:23.933
- I THINK I LIKE THE KNICKS.
- YOU AND I CONNECT.

08:23.967 --> 08:24.967
- YEAH?
- HUH?

08:25.067 --> 08:27.267
THEY'RE GETTING
THREE AND A HALF POINTS.

08:27.300 --> 08:29.333
- 150.
- OKAY.

08:29.367 --> 08:31.500
OKAY... I DON'T EVEN
HAVE ENOUGH CASH.

08:31.533 --> 08:34.067
- CAN I WRITE YOU A CHECK?
- MAKE IT OUT TO CASH.

08:34.067 --> 08:37.167
ALL RIGHT,
COME ON IN FOR A SECOND.
YOU CAN COME IN.

08:37.200 --> 08:39.933
- THAT'S SOMETHING IMPORTANT--
- THAT'S WHAT I TOLD HIM.

08:39.967 --> 08:42.500
HEY-HEY,
LOOK WHO'S HERE.

08:42.533 --> 08:44.433
- BOY, WHAT ARE YOU
FEEDING THIS ANIMAL?
- WHAT YOU MEAN?

08:44.467 --> 08:47.100
HE'S AS FAT AS A HOUSE.
MY GOD, LOOK AT THE SIZE
OF HIM.

08:47.133 --> 08:48.667
WHAT KIND OF THING
IS THAT TO SAY?

08:48.700 --> 08:50.067
YOU'LL HURT
HIS FEELINGS.

08:50.067 --> 08:51.733
LIKE HE KNOWS WHAT
I'M TALKING ABOUT.

08:51.767 --> 08:53.867
HE KNOWS!
YOU DON'T CALL A DOG FAT.

08:53.900 --> 08:55.533
YOU GO AROUND
CALLING JEFF A FAT FUCK.

08:55.567 --> 08:58.067
JEFF IS A FAT FUCK.
OSCAR IS JUST BIG BONED.

08:58.067 --> 09:00.900
HE'S NOT FAT, HE'S LEAN.
HE'S JUST RIGHT.

09:00.933 --> 09:03.667
- THANK YOU.
- HE'S GORGEOUS.

09:03.700 --> 09:05.333
WHAT DO YOU FEED THE DOG?

09:05.367 --> 09:07.500
Susie:
FOOD, YOU KNOW, DOG FOOD.

09:07.533 --> 09:08.800
WHERE DO YOU LIVE?

09:08.833 --> 09:11.700
UH, AROUND
THE NEIGHBORHOOD,
NEARBY.

09:11.733 --> 09:13.933
OH, THEY LIVE
ABOUT TWO BLOCKS UP,

09:13.967 --> 09:16.233
BIG GRAY HOUSE
WITH WHITE COLUMNS.

09:16.267 --> 09:18.300
- WHI-WHITE COLUMNS?
- YEAH, CAN'T MISS IT.

09:18.333 --> 09:19.767
IT'S RIGHT
ON THE RIGHT SIDE.

09:19.800 --> 09:21.867
- TWO BLOCKS?
- YEAH.

09:21.900 --> 09:25.067
UM, I'LL BE RIGHT DOWN.

09:25.067 --> 09:28.533
THIS IS SUNG;
CHERYL, SUSIE, OSCAR.

09:28.567 --> 09:29.733
- HI.
- HI.

09:29.767 --> 09:31.500
NICE TO MEET YOU.

09:31.533 --> 09:34.567
HE'S A BEAUTIFUL DOG.

09:39.200 --> 09:41.400
Jeff:
WHY-WHY DID YOU TELL HER
THE DOG'S FAT?

09:41.433 --> 09:44.133
Larry:
WHY? BECAUSE HE IS FAT.
HE'S GAINED ABOUT 25 LBS.

09:44.167 --> 09:46.800
YOU DON'T TELL HER THAT.
YOU CAN THINK THAT,
TELL ME EVEN.

09:46.833 --> 09:49.267
- WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU FEEDING IT?
- SHE FEEDS IT, I'M NOT.

09:49.300 --> 09:50.733
I DON'T GET THE WHOLE
DOG THING ANYWAY.

09:50.767 --> 09:53.367
- WE HAD A DOG--
SHERIFF, REMEMBER?
- I KNOW SHERIFF.

09:53.400 --> 09:55.067
IT'S LIKE HAVING A BUM
LIVING IN YOUR HOUSE.

09:55.067 --> 09:57.167
WHEN EVERYBODY HATES ME,
MY DOG LOVES ME.

09:57.200 --> 09:58.667
HEY, STOP THE CAR
FOR A SECOND.

10:01.233 --> 10:04.100
- THAT HEINEMAN'S CAR?
- YEAH, THAT'S HEINEMAN'S CAR.

10:04.133 --> 10:05.367
BUT LOOK...

10:05.400 --> 10:07.533
HE NEVER FIXED THE DENT.

10:07.567 --> 10:09.700
REMEMBER WHEN
I SMASHED INTO IT?

10:09.733 --> 10:13.167
- HE DIDN'T FIX IT. I GAVE HIM
A CHECK FOR $1500.
- WOW!

10:13.200 --> 10:16.233
HE WON'T TALK TO ME SINCE
HIS DAUGHTER JUMPED OFF
THE CHAIR LIFT.

10:16.267 --> 10:17.933
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

10:26.900 --> 10:28.933
OY, PERFECT.

10:30.167 --> 10:32.533
- HELLO.
- LARRY.

10:32.567 --> 10:34.800
I WAS DRIVING
BY THE RESTAURANT

10:34.833 --> 10:36.500
AND I COULDN'T HELP
BUT NOTICE

10:36.533 --> 10:39.267
YOU HAVEN'T FIXED
THE DENT ON THE CAR.

10:39.300 --> 10:40.833
NO, I DIDN'T FIX THE DENT.

10:40.867 --> 10:43.433
HMM.
MAY I ASK WHY?

10:43.467 --> 10:46.167
CONSIDERING IT'S NONE
OF YOUR BUSINESS, I HAD
BETTER USE FOR THE MONEY.

10:46.200 --> 10:49.267
- SUCH AS?
- IF YOU MUST KNOW, I GAVE
THE MONEY TO MY DAUGHTER

10:49.300 --> 10:52.167
WHO NEEDS IT FOR SOMETHING
FAR MORE IMPORTANT
THAN FIXING A CAR.

10:52.200 --> 10:55.000
- WHAT DOES SHE NEED IT FOR?
- IT'S NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS.

10:55.033 --> 10:57.833
- IT'S A LITTLE UNETHICAL--
- IT HAS NOTHING TO DO--

10:57.867 --> 11:00.733
- --NOT TO FIX THE CAR.
- IT HAS NOTHING TO DO
WITH ETHICS.

11:00.767 --> 11:03.633
YOU GAVE ME MY MONEY.
I CAN DO WITH THAT MONEY
WHAT I PLEASE.

11:03.667 --> 11:04.900
ARE THESE PICKLES?

11:04.933 --> 11:07.300
- THEY'RE MINE!
- ( Larry chuckles )

11:07.333 --> 11:10.067
ALL RIGHT.
MAN, TAKE IT EASY.

11:10.067 --> 11:13.500
- GOOD DAY, MR. DAVID.
- GOOD DAY, MR. HEINEMAN.

11:15.967 --> 11:19.167
PFFT, BOY,
THAT WENT WELL.

11:19.200 --> 11:21.700
HE SAID HE HAS NO INTENTION
OF GETTING THE CAR FIXED.

11:21.733 --> 11:24.267
HE GAVE THE MONEY
TO HIS DAUGHTER,
SAID SHE NEEDED IT.

11:24.300 --> 11:26.267
WELL, THAT'S
A BIG BOWL OF WRONG.

11:26.300 --> 11:28.467
- YOU CAN'T DO THAT.
- YOU CAN'T DO THAT.

11:28.500 --> 11:30.067
( cell phone rings )

11:30.067 --> 11:31.433
HELLO?

11:31.467 --> 11:33.233
HEY, HONEY.

11:33.267 --> 11:35.733
HEY, ASK HER
HOW THE KNICKS DID.
I GOT $150 ON THEM--

11:35.767 --> 11:37.900
WHEN?
YOU'RE KIDDING ME?

11:39.700 --> 11:41.567
WELL, WHERE ARE YOU?

11:41.600 --> 11:44.167
ALL RIGHT, I'LL BE THERE
IN LIKE 10 MINUTES.

11:44.200 --> 11:49.067
OSCAR WENT INTO THE PANTRY,
HAD THREE BOXES OF OREOS
AND NOW HE'S GONNA DIE.

11:49.067 --> 11:51.367
- WHAT?!
- HE'S AT THE VET.
HE'S GONNA DIE.

11:53.233 --> 11:55.433
I TOLD YOU YOU'RE FEEDING
THAT DOG TOO MUCH.

11:55.467 --> 11:58.267
I DON'T FEED HIM OREOS!

12:05.633 --> 12:07.367
ALL RIGHT, UH...

12:07.400 --> 12:10.733
I'LL BE IN THE EXAMINING ROOM.
JUST WAIT OUT HERE.
I'LL BE BACK.

12:15.367 --> 12:17.367
( exhales loudly )

12:20.167 --> 12:22.500
EXCUSE ME?
YOU WOULDN'T HAPPEN
TO KNOW

12:22.533 --> 12:24.567
THE SCORE
OF THE KNICK GAME
LAST NIGHT?

12:24.600 --> 12:27.433
OH, THE KNICKS?
OH, THAT WAS A GREAT GAME.

12:27.467 --> 12:29.400
- WENT INTO OVERTIME.
- REALLY?

12:29.433 --> 12:30.933
YEAH, THEY LOST BY FOUR.

12:30.967 --> 12:33.100
- ( phone rings )
- ( dog barking )

12:37.367 --> 12:39.233
( Larry groaning )

12:41.833 --> 12:44.267
- LARRY?
- ( groaning continues )

12:44.300 --> 12:46.300
- OH, HONEY...
- NO!

12:46.333 --> 12:49.067
- OSCAR'S GONNA BE OKAY.
- Susie: HE'S SEDATED.

12:49.067 --> 12:51.300
HE'S GONNA BE FINE.
WE'RE GOING TO TAKE HIM HOME.

12:53.067 --> 12:56.833
- I LOVE THAT DOG.
- OH, LARRY...

12:56.867 --> 12:58.833
- SO SWEET.
- UH-HUH.

12:58.867 --> 13:02.067
OH, LARRY.

13:09.200 --> 13:12.433
HEY, YOU GOT SOMETHING
FROM MARLA,

13:12.467 --> 13:16.167
- TO "LARRY DAVID."
- MARLA?

13:16.200 --> 13:18.567
THE ONE WHO
RUINED MY JACKET?
THAT MARLA?

13:18.600 --> 13:20.500
- YEAH.
- REALLY?

13:20.533 --> 13:23.467
WELL, GIVE IT TO ME.
WHAT ARE YOU OPENING IT FOR?

13:23.500 --> 13:25.133
IT'S ALREADY OPEN NOW.

13:25.167 --> 13:26.833
SHE'S MY FRIEND.

13:26.867 --> 13:29.633
"HI, LARRY,
SORRY ABOUT THE JACKET,
MARLA."

13:29.667 --> 13:32.067
THERE'S A CHECK.

13:32.100 --> 13:33.667
WHAT?!

13:33.700 --> 13:35.700
A CHECK!

13:35.733 --> 13:37.700
$150!

13:37.733 --> 13:40.767
WOW!

13:40.800 --> 13:44.867
- BOY, YOU DON'T
SEE THAT VERY OFTEN.
- WHAT'S THAT?

13:44.900 --> 13:46.333
WELL, SOMEBODY DOES
SOMETHING WRONG

13:46.367 --> 13:49.533
AND THEN THEY MAKE UP FOR IT
WITH SOMETHING LIKE THIS.

13:49.567 --> 13:51.633
THIS IS QUITE A GESTURE.

13:51.667 --> 13:53.767
I HAD HER PEGGED
ALL WRONG, I THINK.

13:53.800 --> 13:56.267
I GUESS I SHOULD
KEEP IT, RIGHT?

13:56.300 --> 13:59.633
SOMETIMES YOU
RIP UP THESE CHECKS,
IT SCREWS UP THE BOOKS.

13:59.667 --> 14:01.767
- YEAH.
- IT DOES, HONESTLY.

14:01.800 --> 14:03.967
I'LL KEEP THE CHECK.

14:04.067 --> 14:07.533
IT CAN REALLY SCREW UP
THE BOOKS, THESE THINGS.

14:07.567 --> 14:09.833
- WELL, I-I--
- REALLY NICE.

14:09.867 --> 14:13.467
I'M IMPRESSED THAT YOU
EVEN REALIZE WHAT A NICE
GESTURE THAT IS.

14:13.500 --> 14:16.133
I'M APOLOGIZING ALL THE TIME,
TELLING PEOPLE I'M SORRY.

14:16.167 --> 14:18.567
I KNOW WHEN I'VE DONE
SOMETHING WRONG. I'M NOT
AFRAID TO APOLOGIZE.

14:18.600 --> 14:21.767
MOST PEOPLE, I HAVE TO SAY,
AND MY MOTHER ALWAYS USED
TO TELL ME THIS,

14:21.800 --> 14:23.567
"MOST PEOPLE AREN'T
LIKE YOU, LARRY.

14:23.600 --> 14:25.667
MOST PEOPLE ARE NOT
LIKE YOU.

14:25.700 --> 14:27.533
YOU'RE SPECIAL."

14:27.567 --> 14:30.067
YOU KNOW?
EVERYBODY'S NOT LIKE ME.

14:30.067 --> 14:33.933
- NO, THEY'RE NOT, NO.
- WHEN I DO SOMETHING WRONG,
I SAY, "I'M SORRY."

14:33.967 --> 14:37.167
IT'S THE BIG-- YOU KNOW,
YOU GIVE IT UP.

14:37.200 --> 14:38.800
YOU DO SOMETHING WRONG,
YOU SAY IT.

14:38.833 --> 14:41.200
THAT'S WHAT SHE DID.
THAT'S WHAT THAT CHECK
IS ABOUT.

14:41.233 --> 14:45.067
I KNOW, I KNOW AND I-I--
LISTEN,

14:45.067 --> 14:48.667
THIS MAKES ME FEEL
SO MUCH BETTER TO KNOW
HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT MARLA NOW.

14:48.700 --> 14:51.067
SO WHEN WE GO TO THEIR WEDDING,
IT'S NOT GONNA BE WEIRD.

14:51.067 --> 14:54.367
- IT WILL BE
COMFORTABLE. YEAH.
- IT'LL BE COMFORTABLE.

14:55.467 --> 14:57.600
AND I HAVE TO SAY,

14:57.633 --> 15:00.067
I THOUGHT IT WAS VERY TOUCHING

15:00.100 --> 15:03.333
HOW SENSITIVE YOU WERE
ABOUT OSCAR TODAY.

15:03.367 --> 15:06.733
OH, COME ON...
IT'S OSCAR, MAN.

15:06.767 --> 15:10.233
- OH.
- I KNOW, BUT I JUST--
I DON'T USUALLY SEE YOU...

15:10.267 --> 15:12.800
I DON'T KNOW.

15:12.833 --> 15:17.133
SO... KIND OF IN TOUCH
WITH YOUR EMOTIONS.

15:17.167 --> 15:19.200
- REALLY?
- AND WILLING TO...

15:19.233 --> 15:23.400
I MEAN, YOU'D HAVE TO BE
INHUMAN NOT TO FEEL SOMETHING
IN A MOMENT LIKE THAT.

15:23.433 --> 15:26.800
THE POOR DOG IS FIGHTING
FOR HIS LIFE, YOU KNOW,

15:26.833 --> 15:29.133
I LOVE THAT DOG.
I MEAN...

15:29.167 --> 15:32.500
( sighs )
IF ANYTHING EVER HAPPENED
TO HIM, I-I DON'T KNOW...

15:32.533 --> 15:34.600
- I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I'D DO, BUT...
- OH.

15:34.633 --> 15:37.967
- I'M SURE I'D FIGURE
SOMETHING OUT.
- LARRY.

15:38.067 --> 15:41.267
I-I LOVE
THAT FREAKING DOG.

15:41.300 --> 15:43.433
- YOU KNOW?
- I KNOW.

15:45.067 --> 15:48.600
HUH. HEY,
WHOA, NELSON.

15:48.633 --> 15:51.067
( chuckles )

15:51.067 --> 15:53.800
WHAT YOU GOT--
WHAT YOU GOT UP
YOUR SLEEVE HERE?

15:53.833 --> 15:55.833
I DON'T KNOW.
WHAT YOU GOT UP YOUR SLEEVE?

15:55.867 --> 15:59.567
AM I DETECTING A LITTLE...
DAYTIME SEX HERE?

15:59.600 --> 16:02.300
IS THAT WHAT
THIS IS ABOUT?

16:02.333 --> 16:05.633
DAYTIME SEX?
I LOVE DAYTIME SEX.

16:05.667 --> 16:07.800
THEN YOU CAN JUST GO ON
WITH THE REST OF THE DAY

16:07.833 --> 16:09.733
- AS IF NOTHING HAPPEN--
- OKAY, OKAY.

16:09.767 --> 16:11.067
( moans )

16:18.367 --> 16:19.967
( Susie calling )
OSCAR!

16:20.067 --> 16:21.833
OSCAR, WHERE THE FUCK
ARE YOU?

16:21.867 --> 16:25.067
JEFF, LOOK IN THE GARDEN SHED.
HE'S GOT TO BE SOMEWHERE.

16:25.067 --> 16:26.833
- OSCAR!
- Jeff: I'M LOOKING.

16:26.867 --> 16:28.633
HAVE YOU SEE OSCAR?
WAS HE OUTSIDE?

16:28.667 --> 16:30.233
- NO.
- HE'S MISSING.

16:30.267 --> 16:32.700
- OSCAR'S MISSING?
- YES, HE'S MISSING.
HE WAS SEDATED.

16:32.733 --> 16:34.800
WE SEDATED HIM
YESTERDAY AT THE VET.

16:34.833 --> 16:37.700
HE WAS LYING IN THE BACKYARD
AND NOW HE'S GONE.

16:37.733 --> 16:39.933
HE COULD BARELY WALK
TWO STEPS-- JEFF!

16:39.967 --> 16:42.600
- I DON'T KNOW.
I'VE LOOKED EVERYWHERE.
- HUH!

16:42.633 --> 16:44.900
- I HAVE NO IDEA.
- MAYBE SOMEBODY KIDNAPPED HI.

16:44.933 --> 16:46.800
NO ONE'S GOING TO KIDNAP
A SEDATED DOG.

16:46.833 --> 16:48.967
WELL, WHERE THE FUCK
IS HE, JEFF?

16:49.067 --> 16:51.200
GOD.
OSCAR!

16:51.233 --> 16:52.400
( footsteps receding )

16:52.433 --> 16:55.733
- THIS IS CRAZY.
- ( scoffs )

16:55.767 --> 16:57.900
- YOU KNOW WHAT?
- WHAT?

16:57.933 --> 17:00.967
- I HAVE A KOREAN BOOKIE.
- YEAH?

17:01.067 --> 17:03.333
- WHEN HE WAS OVER AT
THE HOUSE THE OTHER DAY--
- YEAH?

17:05.300 --> 17:07.933
HE SAW OSCAR THERE.
HE WAS KIND OF DROOLING
OVER HIM A LITTLE BIT.

17:07.967 --> 17:10.500
SO... HE LIKES MY DOG.

17:10.533 --> 17:13.400
WELL, YOU KNOW
IT'S NOT A MYTH,

17:13.433 --> 17:15.633
THEY DO EAT DOGS.

17:15.667 --> 17:17.467
- THEY EAT DOGS?!
- YEAH.

17:17.500 --> 17:19.067
SOME KOREANS EAT DOGS.

17:19.067 --> 17:20.833
- UGH!
- WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT?

17:20.867 --> 17:23.633
- WHAT?
- I GOTTA GO OVER THERE NOW.
HE'S GOT A FLOWER SHOP.

17:23.667 --> 17:25.533
I GOTTA PAY OFF
MY KNICK LOSS.

17:25.567 --> 17:27.533
I'LL SUSS IT OUT.
I'LL FEEL IT OUT.

17:27.567 --> 17:30.933
I'M SURE HE DIDN'T EAT
YOUR DOG-- I SHOULDN'T
HAVE BROUGHT IT UP.

17:30.967 --> 17:32.733
YOU SHOULDN'T
HAVE BROUGHT IT UP.
THAT MADE ME A LITTLE--

17:32.767 --> 17:35.767
- NO, NO, DON'T-- FORGET IT.
- ALL RIGHT, FORGOTTEN.

17:35.800 --> 17:38.333
HE DIDN'T KIDNAP
AND EAT YOUR DOG, OKAY?

17:38.367 --> 17:40.200
DON'T--
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

17:47.867 --> 17:51.300
Sung:
OH, NO, MARLA.

17:51.333 --> 17:54.300
I GOT IT TAKEN CARE OF.
THE BEACH IS A GOOD IDEA.

17:54.333 --> 17:55.967
YEAH, TELL MARK
I SAID HI.

17:56.067 --> 17:59.400
OKAY. BYE.

17:59.433 --> 18:01.367

18:01.400 --> 18:03.267

18:03.300 --> 18:05.767

18:05.800 --> 18:07.133
- YOU'RE GONNA BE THERE?
- YEAH!

18:07.167 --> 18:08.833
- I SEE YOU THERE!
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

18:08.867 --> 18:11.067
- FLOWER, DUMB-DUMB.
- YOU'RE DOING THE FLOWERS?

18:11.067 --> 18:13.100
- THE WEDDING NEED FLOWERS.
- HUH, HUH.

18:13.133 --> 18:16.233
- WILL YOU SAY HI TO ME

18:16.267 --> 18:18.533

18:20.167 --> 18:23.433
- HERE WE GO...
- UH, OKAY,

18:23.467 --> 18:25.300
UNBELIEVABLE.

18:25.333 --> 18:27.533
I'M-- I DON'T
HAVE THE CASH.

18:27.567 --> 18:29.700
HOW COME YOU NEVER
HAVE CASH, LARRY?

18:29.733 --> 18:31.300
I'M SORRY, SUNG.
I'M SORRY.

18:31.333 --> 18:33.600
- NO, I SEE YOU ON THE--

I GOT A CHECK FROM MARLA
MADE OUT TO ME FOR $150.
I'LL SIGN IT RIGHT OVER TO YOU.

18:42.067 --> 18:45.067
- OKAY, LAST TIME.
- LAST TIME, SUNG.
I'M SORRY, I PROMISE.

18:45.067 --> 18:47.967
- 'CAUSE I LIKE YOU.
- OKAY, OKAY, I'M SORRY.

18:48.067 --> 18:50.533
- OKAY.
- I KNOW WHERE YOU LIVE.

18:50.567 --> 18:51.967
( laughs )

18:52.067 --> 18:54.100
OH, YOU KNOW WHAT?

18:54.133 --> 18:56.067
WHAT?

18:56.067 --> 18:58.600
- YOU KNOW WHO I'M LIKING?
- I HAVE A FEELING.

18:58.633 --> 19:01.867
NO, NOT LIKING, NOT LIKING,
SUNG, LOVING.

19:01.900 --> 19:03.667

19:05.967 --> 19:07.700
Both:
CELTICS!

19:07.733 --> 19:09.967
I KNEW IT,
'CAUSE I THINK
THE SAME THING AS YOU!

19:10.067 --> 19:12.067
- HOW DID YOU KNOW THAT?
- YOU'RE GOING TO WIN!

19:12.100 --> 19:13.767
I THINK IT.
YOU'RE GONNA WIN.

19:13.800 --> 19:16.100
- $300 ON THE CELTICS.
- WINNER.

19:16.133 --> 19:17.767

I LOVE 'EM.

19:17.800 --> 19:19.400

19:19.433 --> 19:21.700

19:25.700 --> 19:27.967
OHH,

19:29.333 --> 19:31.067
WHAT ARE YOU
EATING, SUNG?

19:31.100 --> 19:34.067
LARRY, THIS IS
FRESH MEAT.

19:34.100 --> 19:36.067
IT'S QUITE
DELECTABLE.

19:36.100 --> 19:38.367
WHAT KIND OF MEAT?

19:38.400 --> 19:40.533
THE BEST KIND.

19:40.567 --> 19:43.100
ONLY THE BEST FOR SUNG.

19:43.133 --> 19:46.467
SO I DON'T KNOW
IF YOU'RE AWARE OF THIS
OR NOT, BUT...

19:46.500 --> 19:48.800
OSCAR'S MISSING.

19:48.833 --> 19:51.767
OH, THAT'S TOO BAD.
HE'S A GOOD DOG.

19:51.800 --> 19:54.100
- YEAH, HE'S A GOOD DOG.
- YES.

19:54.133 --> 19:56.500
YOU WOULDN'T HAPPEN
TO KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT?

19:56.533 --> 19:59.800
UH, NO, LARRY.

19:59.833 --> 20:01.733
ARE YOU SURE?

20:01.767 --> 20:03.500
YES.

20:13.833 --> 20:15.900
OKAY.

20:15.933 --> 20:18.100
SEE YOU
AT THE WEDDING.

20:26.233 --> 20:30.033
SO, UH, I SAW THAT CAR
YOU HIT THE OTHER DAY
IN THE PARKING LOT.

20:30.067 --> 20:32.667
- HEINEMAN'S CAR?
- YEAH.

20:32.700 --> 20:34.300
WHAT THE--
HEINEMAN'S HERE?

20:34.333 --> 20:36.533
I DIDN'T SEE HIM,
I JUST SAW THE CAR.

20:36.567 --> 20:39.300
- WHAT THE HELL IS
HE DOING HERE?
- NO IDEA.

20:40.633 --> 20:43.467
- WHAT'S WITH THE HAT?
- WHAT?

20:43.500 --> 20:46.600
- I'M MARRIED,
I CAN WEAR WHATEVER I WANT.
- IT DOES LOOK RIDICULOUS.

20:46.633 --> 20:48.600
YOU LOOK LIKE YOU SHOULD
BE PULLING A RICKSHAW.

20:48.633 --> 20:50.600
- I COULD CARE LESS.
- BUT NONETHELESS...

20:50.633 --> 20:54.033
BOY, I TELL YOU SOMETHING,
THIS IS ONE HELL OF
A TITTY FESTIVAL.

20:54.067 --> 20:55.867
THEY'RE ALL OVER THE PLACE.

20:55.900 --> 20:58.333
BIG BOSOMSEVERYWHERE YOU LOOK.

20:58.367 --> 20:59.667

20:59.700 --> 21:02.500
MARK OBVIOUSLY INVITED
A LOT OF HIS CLIENTS.

21:02.533 --> 21:04.333
OF COURSE, OF COURSE!

21:04.367 --> 21:06.867
HE GAVE THEM ALL BOOBS JOBS,
INVITED HIS CLIENTS.

21:08.233 --> 21:10.067
OH, HEY, THERE'S SUNG,
MY BOOKIE.

21:10.067 --> 21:13.433

- NOTHING. FORGET THAT.

21:13.467 --> 21:14.733
IS THAT HEINEMAN'S
DAUGHTER?

21:14.767 --> 21:17.333
YEAH.
NO WONDER WHY
THE CAR'S THERE.

21:17.367 --> 21:19.633
- Jeff: LOOK...
- JESUS, LOOK AT THE SIZE
OF HER.

21:19.667 --> 21:21.733
- WHAT HAS SHE DONE?
- Jeff: HOLY SHIT.

21:21.767 --> 21:25.200
HEINEMAN TOLD ME
THAT HE TOOK THE MONEY
I GAVE HIM, THE $1500

21:25.233 --> 21:26.833
AND GAVE IT
TO HIS DAUGHTER
AND DIDN'T TELL ME WHY.

21:26.867 --> 21:28.433
HE SAID SHE NEEDED IT
FOR SOMETHING.

21:30.067 --> 21:31.667
I PAID FOR THOSE THINGS.

21:31.700 --> 21:34.167
YOU PAID FOR THOSE
GIANT FAKE TITTIES.

21:34.200 --> 21:36.967
COME ON, MAN.
WHAT IS THAT?
WHAT'S UP WITH THAT?

21:39.700 --> 21:43.067
OKAY, WE'LL TALK TO YOU SOON.
ALL RIGHT, BYE-BYE.

21:44.533 --> 21:47.533
- WOW!
- HELLO.

21:47.567 --> 21:49.867
HELLO.

21:49.900 --> 21:51.867
HOW ARE YOU?

21:51.900 --> 21:53.800
I'M FINE, THANK YOU.

21:53.833 --> 21:56.733
YOU'VE UNDERGONE
QUITE A TRANSFORMATION

21:56.767 --> 21:58.433
SINCE THE LAST TIME
I SAW YOU.

21:58.467 --> 22:02.200
YES, MY FATHER THOUGHT
IT WOULD BRING MORE JOY
TO MY SOCIAL INTERACTIONS.

22:02.233 --> 22:04.733
- REALLY? IS THAT
WHAT HE THOUGHT?
- YES.

22:04.767 --> 22:06.667
LET ME JUST SAY THIS, OKAY?

22:06.700 --> 22:08.633
"LESS IS MORE."

22:08.667 --> 22:11.733
I THINK YOU WENT
A LITTLE... TOO BIG ON IT.

22:11.767 --> 22:12.900
IT'S JUST MY OPINION.

22:12.933 --> 22:14.833
WELL, THANK YOU
FOR YOUR OPINION.

22:14.867 --> 22:17.767
BUT WE THOUGHT THEY WOULD BE
FESTIVE IF THEY WERE
APPROPRIATELY SIZED.

22:17.800 --> 22:21.333
THEY-THEY'RE FESTIVE, MAN.
THAT'S A FESTIVAL IF I
EVER SAW ONE.

22:21.367 --> 22:24.100
I DON'T KNOW WHAT KIND
OF GUY YOU'RE GOING AFTER
WITH THOSE THINGS,

22:24.133 --> 22:26.200
BUT YOU'RE NOT GONNA
GET SOMEBODY LIKE ME.

22:26.233 --> 22:27.967
OH WELL, OH GOD.

22:28.067 --> 22:29.833
ALL RIGHT, WHATEVER.

22:29.867 --> 22:31.967
- GOOD LUCK WITH THEM.
- THANK YOU.

22:32.067 --> 22:34.500
- I HOPE IT WORKS OUT.
- IT'S BEEN WORKING OUT.

22:34.533 --> 22:37.433
- REALLY?
- YES, IT HAS, ABSOLUTELY.

22:37.467 --> 22:39.433
- HEY.
- HEY, LARRY.

22:39.467 --> 22:41.633
- IS THIS YOUR HANDIWORK?
- IT SURE IS, YEAH.

22:41.667 --> 22:44.533
- ONE OF MY BEST PATIENTS.
- REALLY?

22:44.567 --> 22:47.067
- HOW ARE YOU?
- GOOD, THANK YOU.
THEY FEEL GREAT.

22:47.067 --> 22:48.767
MY LUMBAR SECTION
OF THE BACK HURTS
A LITTLE.

22:48.800 --> 22:52.733
YOU WENT A LITTLE BIG.
WERE YOU DRUNK AT THE TIME
YOU DID THIS THING?

22:52.767 --> 22:53.867
HE THINKS
THEY'RE TOO BIG.

22:53.900 --> 22:55.433
THIS IS COMPLETELY
NATURAL, LARRY.

22:55.467 --> 22:58.633
- IT'S PROPORTIONATE--
- IT'S NATURAL AT
A FREAK SHOW MAYBE.

22:58.667 --> 23:01.867
- I DON'T THINK SO,
I THINK THEY'RE PERFECT.
- NOT VERY SUBTLE.

23:01.900 --> 23:05.333
IT'S NOT ABOUT SUBTLETY,
LARRY, IT'S ABOUT EXCELLENCE
AND CONFIDENCE.

23:05.367 --> 23:07.800
- I PAID FOR THEM,
BY THE WAY.
- EXCUSE ME?

23:07.833 --> 23:11.067
YEAH, I GAVE YOUR FATHER
A CHECK FOR THE CAR, $1500.

23:11.067 --> 23:12.400
HE GAVE IT TO YOU FOR THIS.

23:12.433 --> 23:15.567
- NOT ALL OF IT.
- MY CHECK, MY CHECK
PAID FOR THOSE.

23:15.600 --> 23:17.667
- THAT'S WHERE
MY MONEY'S GOING.
- MAYBE COVERED THE LEFT,

23:17.700 --> 23:19.933
- THE BOTTOM PORTION
OF THE LEFT HALF.
- EXACTLY.

23:19.967 --> 23:22.133
EXACTLY.

23:24.200 --> 23:26.633
EXCUSE ME.

23:26.667 --> 23:29.367
YOU WOULDN'T HAPPEN TO KNOW
THE SCORE OF THE CELTIC GAME
LAST NIGHT, WOULD YOU?

23:29.400 --> 23:32.267
UH... CELTICS LOST BY THREE.

23:33.867 --> 23:35.833
( groans )
MAN...

23:35.867 --> 23:37.867
WHY CAN'T I CATCH A BREAK
ON THIS SHIT, OH!

23:37.900 --> 23:40.467
- WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH HIM?
- I DON'T KNOW.

23:40.500 --> 23:42.067
( moaning continues )

23:42.100 --> 23:45.100
LARRY?
LARRY, WHAT'S WRONG?

23:45.133 --> 23:46.933
I JUST TOLD HIM
THE CELTICS LOST.

23:58.067 --> 24:01.167
OH, I THINK
I'LL... GET MY COAT.

24:01.200 --> 24:02.967
I'M GETTING
A LITTLE CHILLY.

24:11.067 --> 24:14.067
MARK, DO YOU TAKE
THIS WOMAN, MARLA,

24:14.100 --> 24:16.067
TO BE YOUR
LAWFULLY WEDDED WIFE,

24:16.100 --> 24:19.200
TO HAVE AND TO HOLD
UNTIL DEATH DO YOU PART?

24:19.233 --> 24:21.333
I DO.

24:21.367 --> 24:24.600
AND DO YOU, MARLA,
TAKE THIS MAN, MARK,

24:24.633 --> 24:26.800

TO HAVE AND TO HOLD
IN SICKNESS AND IN HEALTH

24:29.967 --> 24:31.733
UNTIL DEATH DO YOU PART?

24:35.333 --> 24:37.467
YOU HAVE GOT
TO BE KIDDING ME.

24:37.500 --> 24:39.933
- Mark: HONEY,
IS THERE A PROBLEM?
- WHAT?

24:39.967 --> 24:42.567
WHERE'S THE NEW JACKET,
LARRY?

24:44.233 --> 24:46.267
THERE-- I DIDN'T
BUY A NEW JACKET.

24:46.300 --> 24:48.967
I SENT YOU $150.
DID YOU RECEIVE IT?

24:49.067 --> 24:51.400
- YEAH.
- WELL, WHERE IS
THE NEW JACKET?

24:51.433 --> 24:52.867
WELL, I DIDN'T BUY
A NEW JACKET.

24:52.900 --> 24:55.333
IT'S MY MONEY.
I CAN DO WHATEVER
I WANT WITH IT, NO?

24:55.367 --> 24:59.367
NO, THAT WAS MY MONEY
I GAVE TO YOU TO REPLACE
THE SOILED JACKET.

24:59.400 --> 25:00.867
I TOLD HIM TO BUY
A JACKET--

25:00.900 --> 25:04.167
- FIRST, YOU
DESTROYED MY JACKET.
- --BEFORE HE SEES YOU AGAIN.

25:04.200 --> 25:06.867
I DON'T NEED TO BUY
A NEW JACKET JUST
'CAUSE YOU SAY.

25:06.900 --> 25:09.867
DID YOU READ THE MEMO
OF THE CHECK I SENT YOU,
LARRY?

25:09.900 --> 25:13.633
IT SAID,
"REPLACE FLEECE JACKET."
REPLACE FLEECE JACKET.

25:13.667 --> 25:16.433
( all arguing )

25:20.467 --> 25:23.867
- Jeff: UNBELIEVABLE.
- HAVE YOU EVER TASTED ANYTHING
LIKE THIS IN YOUR LIFE?

25:23.900 --> 25:25.400
IT'S FANTASTIC.

25:26.400 --> 25:28.233
HMM.

25:28.267 --> 25:31.067
- THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE.
- I'VE NEVER TASTED ANYTHING
LIKE IT.

25:31.067 --> 25:33.467
