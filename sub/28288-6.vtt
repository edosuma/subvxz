WEBVTT

00:02.108 --> 00:04.067
Identify yourselves.

00:04.110 --> 00:05.590
I'm Landry du Lauzon.

00:05.634 --> 00:07.374
Kill them!

00:07.418 --> 00:09.376
My father
ordered me to find Landry

00:09.420 --> 00:11.509
and his child and kill them.

00:11.553 --> 00:15.382
You'll have to kill me
before I give her up.

00:15.426 --> 00:17.602
You're right
to worry about the future.

00:17.646 --> 00:21.519
France is not always
kind to queens.

00:21.563 --> 00:23.608
I didn't kill your mother.
Your father did.

00:23.652 --> 00:25.828
You are responsible for
my mother's death!

00:29.788 --> 00:33.183
Did my father
kill my mother?

00:33.226 --> 00:34.793
Mm-hmm.

00:34.837 --> 00:37.361
Inside the cone is
a powerful black powder

00:37.404 --> 00:38.404
that combusts.

00:40.451 --> 00:42.758
Have we the necessary supply to
bring Chartres Temple

00:42.801 --> 00:44.498
- to the ground?
- We do, Your Majesty.

00:44.542 --> 00:45.848
We march tonight.

00:46.892 --> 00:48.938
Prepare for war!

00:54.291 --> 00:57.860
You have outdone yourself,
Mistress Alice.

00:57.903 --> 01:00.558
It's perfect.

01:00.602 --> 01:04.780
The perfect dress
for a perfect day.

01:04.822 --> 01:06.869
If I may be so bold,

01:06.912 --> 01:09.045
what's the occasion,
Your Grace?

01:09.088 --> 01:11.395
Nothing momentous.

01:11.438 --> 01:13.397
Just a sisterly
supper for Princess Margaret

01:13.440 --> 01:14.659
and myself.

01:14.703 --> 01:17.662
Oh. Sounds splendid,
Your Grace.

01:17.706 --> 01:20.447
Oh, it will be splendid,
Mistress Alice.

01:20.491 --> 01:22.711
Splendid, indeed.

01:24.000 --> 01:30.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:40.729 --> 01:44.907
Brothers.

01:44.950 --> 01:47.431
Brother.

02:15.807 --> 02:19.419
Templars!
You must open your gates

02:19.463 --> 02:22.031
and present yourselves
to face King Philip's

02:22.074 --> 02:24.337
accusations of heresy!

03:16.433 --> 03:19.958
Arise,
Grandmaster De Molay.

03:20.002 --> 03:23.048
I would have words
with you in private.

03:23.092 --> 03:26.443
Your Holiness,
with utmost respect,

03:26.486 --> 03:28.532
our words should be heard
by your most dedicated

03:28.575 --> 03:30.316
and loyal retainers.

03:30.360 --> 03:33.102
Their fate is at stake
here as well as my own.

03:33.145 --> 03:34.799
As you wish.

03:39.369 --> 03:43.590
Claims have been made
that during

03:43.634 --> 03:47.681
Templar admission ceremonies,
your Initiates were forced to

03:47.725 --> 03:49.509
spit on the Cross...

03:49.553 --> 03:50.859
What?!

03:50.902 --> 03:52.208
...deny Christ...

03:52.251 --> 03:53.644
That's a lie.

03:53.687 --> 03:56.255
...and engage
in indecent kissing.

03:59.084 --> 04:04.786
You are also accused of
worshiping a silver idol,

04:04.829 --> 04:08.311
encouraging brothers
to engage in unnatural acts,

04:08.354 --> 04:12.097
financial corruption,
sorcery, and witchcraft!

04:15.753 --> 04:19.148
Silence, brothers!

04:19.190 --> 04:24.109
You must surrender
to face these charges.

04:24.153 --> 04:27.243
The case will not be adjudicated
by the Royal Court of France,

04:27.286 --> 04:33.249
but the Holy Inquisition, so
King Philip will hold no sway.

04:33.292 --> 04:35.425
You have my word.

04:35.468 --> 04:40.909
You will all receive
a fair trial.

04:40.952 --> 04:44.260
Grandmaster, permission
to speak plainly.

04:44.303 --> 04:45.609
Granted.

04:45.652 --> 04:47.437
We cannot trust
this new pope.

04:47.480 --> 04:49.221
He is a puppet
of King Philip.

04:49.265 --> 04:51.615
And King Philip was behind
the murder of Pope Boniface.

04:51.658 --> 04:54.966
Grandmaster, if this
madman's words speak

04:55.010 --> 04:57.099
for your whole Order,
then perhaps these

04:57.142 --> 04:59.536
egregious charges
have some merit after all.

04:59.579 --> 05:03.496
But if, as I suspect,
they do not,

05:03.540 --> 05:07.674
I implore you to surrender.

05:07.718 --> 05:11.983
Trust in God's justice.

05:12.027 --> 05:14.681
To remain here within
your fortress walls

05:14.725 --> 05:17.423
will bring disaster
on Mother Church.

05:17.467 --> 05:18.947
Is that how you
and your brothers wish

05:18.990 --> 05:20.644
to be remembered
by history?

05:20.687 --> 05:23.560
As the Holy Order of Knighthood
that plunged the church

05:23.603 --> 05:25.431
into bloody civil war!

05:31.524 --> 05:34.266
As much as it pains
and surprises me to say this,

05:34.310 --> 05:36.268
Brother Landry speaks wisdom.

05:36.312 --> 05:39.271
- Aye.
- Aye.

05:39.315 --> 05:45.974
Pope Clement is the master
and father of our Order.

05:46.017 --> 05:48.715
He gives the commands,
and we follow.

05:48.759 --> 05:52.110
Therefore,
secure in our innocence,

05:52.154 --> 05:55.940
we shall march out and surrender
ourselves to King Philip,

05:55.984 --> 06:00.118
trusting Pope Clement's
promise of a fair hearing

06:00.162 --> 06:02.294
before the inquisitors
and complete exoneration

06:02.338 --> 06:03.817
of our Brotherhood.

06:03.861 --> 06:07.212
Grandmaster, please.
I beg you to reconsider.

06:07.256 --> 06:09.780
If we march out
behind those walls,

06:09.823 --> 06:11.956
we march to our certain death.

06:12.000 --> 06:16.091
I do not fear death!

06:16.134 --> 06:20.704
I fear only my own weakness
and inclination to sin.

06:20.747 --> 06:25.665
Now it is you who speak
words of wisdom, Grandmaster.

06:25.709 --> 06:30.192
But if that is the path
that you take...

06:30.235 --> 06:32.498
I cannot follow.

06:32.542 --> 06:35.980
On this question of
surrender to the king,

06:36.024 --> 06:42.204
each brother knight and sergeant
shall decide for himself.

07:08.752 --> 07:11.189
That does not appear
to be all of them.

07:11.233 --> 07:12.408
It's not.

07:12.451 --> 07:14.149
Good.

07:43.830 --> 07:46.746
Where is the criminal
Landry du Lauzon?

07:51.229 --> 07:53.492
Where is Landry?

08:07.985 --> 08:12.076
Anne,
you must return to the keep,

08:12.120 --> 08:14.600
where it's safe.

08:14.644 --> 08:16.143
You honestly
believe any place

08:16.167 --> 08:19.866
inside these walls
is safe?

08:19.910 --> 08:24.480
You're outnumbered...
and rather vastly.

08:24.523 --> 08:26.438
And under
the circumstances,

08:26.482 --> 08:29.354
I believe you need
all the prayers you can get.

08:29.398 --> 08:32.443
So, Sir Jacques De Molay,

08:32.488 --> 08:37.361
Grandmaster of the Templars,
we finally meet in person.

08:37.405 --> 08:39.712
We've met before,
Your Majesty.

08:39.756 --> 08:42.453
Twice at court
on official business.

08:42.498 --> 08:46.502
Once, I believe, on the Holy Day
of Christ's birth.

08:46.545 --> 08:49.374
Really?
I don't recall.

08:49.418 --> 08:51.463
One of our meetings
involved lending the crown

08:51.507 --> 08:54.075
a considerable sum,

08:54.118 --> 08:55.859
which you failed
to pay back.

08:58.079 --> 08:59.732
You will tell me
all I want to know

08:59.776 --> 09:01.430
of the Chartres Temple.

09:01.473 --> 09:03.997
What weapons you still
have and how many,

09:04.041 --> 09:05.825
the location of
your treasure vaults,

09:05.869 --> 09:07.914
how many men remain within,
how many horses,

09:07.958 --> 09:10.569
how much food, water,
and other supplies.

09:10.613 --> 09:13.485
And the exact location
of the sally port.

09:13.529 --> 09:15.748
What, pray tell,
is a sally port?

09:15.792 --> 09:17.663
A hidden entrance
to a fortress,

09:17.707 --> 09:20.101
allowing defenders
to launch sallys... attacks...

09:20.144 --> 09:21.450
against their besiegers.

09:21.493 --> 09:23.321
Your Holiness,
what of your promise

09:23.365 --> 09:25.280
and guarantee
of a fair trial?

09:25.323 --> 09:28.196
Grandmaster, I am not
without sympathy for you

09:28.239 --> 09:29.849
and your brothers.

09:29.893 --> 09:34.158
So I suggest you answer
His Majesty's questions.

09:34.202 --> 09:35.855
For surely you recall
the Book of Matthew,

09:35.899 --> 09:38.075
Chapter 22, Verse 21,
wherein Christ Our Lord,

09:38.119 --> 09:39.903
in His divine wisdom,
proclaims,

09:39.946 --> 09:42.645
"Render unto Caesar
that which is his."

09:42.688 --> 09:44.690
I surrendered to face
the charges and prove them

09:44.734 --> 09:47.432
all false,
not to discuss

09:47.476 --> 09:49.173
the inner workings
of the Temple.

09:49.217 --> 09:52.220
Your Temple
is finished.

09:52.263 --> 09:54.874
You shall ride off
on no more crusades,

09:54.918 --> 09:56.224
fight in no more
Holy Wars.

09:56.267 --> 09:59.444
Do you understand?

09:59.488 --> 10:02.317
Landry was right
about you.

10:32.869 --> 10:34.610
What's that?

10:34.653 --> 10:38.483
That's the Oriflamme.
Sacred war flag of France.

10:38.527 --> 10:42.095
It means no surrender, no mercy,
just a fight to the death!

10:42.139 --> 10:44.054
Battle positions!

10:45.621 --> 10:47.710
Battle positions!

11:06.642 --> 11:08.600
Guard the wall!

11:10.559 --> 11:12.735
Archers!

11:12.778 --> 11:14.563
Aim!

11:16.869 --> 11:20.090
Here they come!

11:20.133 --> 11:21.309
Loose!

11:25.530 --> 11:26.966
Shields!

11:32.494 --> 11:33.582
Aah!

11:36.411 --> 11:39.370
They're firing again!
Second wave!

11:45.202 --> 11:47.596
Aah!

11:52.122 --> 11:53.297
Attack!

12:11.097 --> 12:14.144
Aah!

12:14.187 --> 12:16.233
Aah!

12:19.628 --> 12:21.238
Follow through, brothers!

12:21.282 --> 12:23.327
Ulric, hold that tower!

12:39.952 --> 12:42.259
Ready!

12:50.789 --> 12:52.661
Easy, easy.

13:00.843 --> 13:02.932
- Back up!
- Back up!

13:02.975 --> 13:04.455
What the hell
are they doing?

13:19.427 --> 13:21.820
- Brothers!
- Mother of God!

13:21.864 --> 13:23.256
What was that thing?

13:23.300 --> 13:26.259
It was like a cask
of Greek fire!

13:26.303 --> 13:29.524
Well, whatever it was, the doors
won't survive another.

13:29.567 --> 13:31.221
What do we do,
Landry?

13:31.264 --> 13:33.397
That wagon is
full of those things.

13:33.441 --> 13:35.573
Who's the best archer
in the temple?

13:44.843 --> 13:47.411
Fellow Templars of Chartres,

13:47.455 --> 13:49.021
your master is with you!

13:49.065 --> 13:50.283
This way!

13:57.465 --> 14:02.208
Now, steady. That cart
is at least 150 paces away.

14:02.252 --> 14:05.777
No worries, Brother.

14:05.821 --> 14:07.518
Easy as pie.

14:17.485 --> 14:18.766
Well,
you bloody well choked on

14:18.790 --> 14:20.357
that piece of pie,
didn't you?

14:20.401 --> 14:23.534
This is different from
stag hunting back home.

14:23.578 --> 14:25.754
I had it.
I had it.

14:30.585 --> 14:34.110
Kelton.
Kelton, look at me.

14:34.153 --> 14:36.547
Just breathe.

14:36.591 --> 14:38.375
It's just another
prize stag grazing

14:38.419 --> 14:40.203
on your father's estate.

14:40.246 --> 14:41.683
Just breathe.

14:53.782 --> 14:55.392
Come on, come on.

14:55.436 --> 14:57.263
Hear me, God.

15:30.383 --> 15:32.429
Your father
taught you well!

15:32.473 --> 15:34.605
Yes!

15:34.649 --> 15:36.477
I never lost
faith in you, Brother.

15:36.520 --> 15:37.608
Never.

15:37.652 --> 15:39.088
That makes one of us.

16:07.203 --> 16:09.335
My Prince.

16:09.379 --> 16:11.337
How goes the battle?

16:11.381 --> 16:14.253
A draw, thus far.

16:14.297 --> 16:16.865
The Templars have
acquitted themselves well,

16:16.908 --> 16:20.825
defending their walls
and countering all assaults.

16:20.869 --> 16:23.132
But the siege
is still young.

16:23.175 --> 16:26.614
And how does my father
handle all this?

16:26.657 --> 16:30.269
Who am I to judge the peaks
and valleys of royalty?

16:30.313 --> 16:33.185
I am but
a simple soldier.

16:33.229 --> 16:35.144
A shrewd answer
for a man who

16:35.187 --> 16:38.234
feigns simplicity,
Sir Gawain.

16:38.277 --> 16:40.541
What are they
building?

16:40.584 --> 16:42.891
In a siege, a journeyman
engineer is worth

16:42.934 --> 16:48.592
250 fighting men,
a highly skilled master, 500.

16:48.636 --> 16:51.682
What these men
build is victory.

16:54.729 --> 16:56.687
My liege.

17:09.482 --> 17:12.355
Oh, there she is.

17:12.397 --> 17:14.923
Margaret of Burgundy.

17:14.965 --> 17:16.838
I've so looked
forward to this.

17:16.881 --> 17:18.448
You take me
by surprise.

17:18.491 --> 17:22.191
I love surprises
and assumed you would, too.

17:22.233 --> 17:25.063
Shall we eat, drink,
and be merry?

17:25.107 --> 17:26.935
Is that coq au vin?

17:26.978 --> 17:30.155
What could be better
for two radiant princesses

17:30.199 --> 17:32.941
than cock and wine?

17:32.984 --> 17:34.507
You are so bad.

17:39.556 --> 17:43.516
Mm, a Burgundian vintage
from the Abbey of Bèze

17:43.560 --> 17:47.303
to go with the rooster
and make you even more at home.

17:47.346 --> 17:51.873
To good health
and long life.

18:02.797 --> 18:04.581
So good.

18:12.894 --> 18:14.635
Mmm.

18:14.678 --> 18:16.724
As good as
the pinot noir?

18:16.767 --> 18:18.160
Better.

18:18.203 --> 18:20.945
So, the future
Queen of France declares

18:20.989 --> 18:25.428
that cock tastes
better than wine?

18:31.782 --> 18:33.392
How goes
your wedding plans?

18:33.436 --> 18:35.699
Oh, no.

18:35.743 --> 18:40.878
I'm here for food, drink,
and the joy of your company,

18:40.922 --> 18:44.055
not to sulk
over my future.

18:44.099 --> 18:45.535
Agreed.

18:45.578 --> 18:48.843
Let us set
the future aside

18:48.886 --> 18:52.498
in favor of the present.

18:52.542 --> 18:54.631
To sisterhood.

18:54.675 --> 18:56.285
Sisterhood.

19:06.164 --> 19:08.384
Sweet dreams, little one.

19:08.427 --> 19:11.735
And you will grow strong

19:11.779 --> 19:17.088
and reverent and kind,

19:17.132 --> 19:21.136
untouched by all of this pain.

19:21.179 --> 19:23.355
That is my dream.

19:27.403 --> 19:29.840
Shh.

19:29.884 --> 19:32.451
Sleep now.
Sleep, sleep, sleep.

19:38.196 --> 19:39.850
Yeah.

20:25.722 --> 20:27.811
My father
keeps me under lock and key

20:27.855 --> 20:30.553
and watchful eye.

20:30.596 --> 20:34.470
But you and your bedchamber
are Louis' concern.

20:37.647 --> 20:41.564
And my brother knows
there's no more trustworthy

20:41.607 --> 20:47.483
and loyal wife in all the world
than Margaret of Burgundy.

20:47.526 --> 20:54.185
So I beg you, Sister,
as my future Queen, indulge me.

20:59.016 --> 21:03.673
Go ahead, then.

21:03.716 --> 21:06.241
Indulge yourself.

21:11.681 --> 21:13.596
Oh.

21:30.047 --> 21:32.267
Apologies for
interrupting your communion

21:32.310 --> 21:34.269
with our Lord and Savior,
but I think it'll

21:34.312 --> 21:36.445
do the men good to see
their master amongst them.

21:36.488 --> 21:39.970
Morale is high,
but it needs to remain so

21:40.014 --> 21:41.885
if we're to survive
this day and those to come.

21:41.929 --> 21:43.887
I worry for
the future, Landry.

21:43.931 --> 21:46.324
Don't. Don't.
We have enough food and water

21:46.368 --> 21:49.545
to hold out for weeks,
if not months.

21:49.588 --> 21:51.218
And after Philip's
first attack, there'll be

21:51.242 --> 21:52.611
a lull in fighting.
We can take advantage.

21:52.635 --> 21:54.419
We can send couriers
through the siege lines

21:54.463 --> 21:56.160
and get messages
to our Temples in

21:56.204 --> 21:59.120
Champagne, Arville,
Normandy, Brittany, Anjou.

21:59.163 --> 22:01.600
Our brothers, they
will answer our call.

22:01.644 --> 22:03.602
That I'm sure.

22:03.646 --> 22:05.604
You misunderstand me,
Brother.

22:05.648 --> 22:09.608
I don't fear for the future
of Chartres Temple.

22:09.652 --> 22:12.742
I worry about the future
of the Order itself.

22:12.785 --> 22:15.397
I fear it is
the end times.

22:15.440 --> 22:19.792
The world is upside down.
We're adrift.

22:19.836 --> 22:21.055
We're adrift together.

22:21.098 --> 22:23.535
Hm.

22:23.579 --> 22:26.103
Who would ever put
the two of us in the same boat?

22:27.975 --> 22:30.891
Man plans, God laughs.

22:33.371 --> 22:37.201
I went to sleep a soldier
in the pope's army.

22:37.245 --> 22:40.552
And I woke up as his foe.

22:40.596 --> 22:42.859
How can this be, Landry?

22:42.903 --> 22:45.514
How can we defy
the pope?

22:45.557 --> 22:48.169
Christ's vicar
on Earth?

22:48.212 --> 22:51.824
The pope
is just a man.

22:51.868 --> 22:54.218
A month ago,
he was called Raymond De Goth,

22:54.262 --> 22:56.568
and he was Archbishop
of Bordeaux.

22:56.612 --> 22:59.354
He doesn't
defend the faith.

22:59.397 --> 23:02.618
He defends the king.

23:02.661 --> 23:05.447
And we do not
fight for him.

23:05.490 --> 23:09.625
We fight for God.

23:09.668 --> 23:12.758
And each other.

23:14.021 --> 23:16.110
Master Berenger!
Landry!

23:16.153 --> 23:19.069
You must come to
the ramparts at once!

23:37.305 --> 23:40.482
A siege tower.

23:40.525 --> 23:42.527
A bloody big one
at that.

23:51.928 --> 23:53.364
Once it's upright, sir,

23:53.408 --> 23:55.105
there's nothing
we can do with it.

23:55.149 --> 24:00.023
That tower can carry
60 men, including spearmen,

24:00.067 --> 24:03.331
swordsmen, crossbowmen,
or archers.

24:03.374 --> 24:05.028
And in order
to defend against it,

24:05.072 --> 24:06.614
we're gonna have to abandon
the rest of the walls.

24:06.638 --> 24:08.640
Leaving them vulnerable
to attack.

24:08.684 --> 24:10.860
Maybe I could hit it
with the fire arrows,

24:10.903 --> 24:12.340
like I did with
the wagon.

24:12.383 --> 24:14.057
No good. Before they
come within bow shot

24:14.081 --> 24:16.300
of those walls, they'll be
covered from top to bottom

24:16.344 --> 24:18.607
in fresh animal hides,
which don't burn.

24:18.650 --> 24:20.478
That's what the Mamluks
did at Acre

24:20.522 --> 24:22.263
when Gawain was there.

24:22.306 --> 24:25.179
If that siege tower
gets to our walls,

24:25.222 --> 24:27.833
our temple will fall.

24:29.835 --> 24:31.446
Master Berenger.

24:31.489 --> 24:33.665
Might this not be
a good time to follow Rule 25

24:33.709 --> 24:35.493
of our Holy Order?

24:35.537 --> 24:38.192
Break out the wine,
divide it equally

24:38.235 --> 24:39.235
amongst all of our brothers.

24:41.021 --> 24:44.546
Unfortunately,
we don't have enough wine.

24:47.244 --> 24:50.247
Nor enough men to defend
against that siege tower.

24:53.598 --> 24:58.255
No. No, we don't,
which is why we should do

24:58.299 --> 25:01.258
what they least expect.

25:01.302 --> 25:03.739
We should bring
the fight to them.

25:03.782 --> 25:07.351
Christ be with me.
Christ within me.

25:07.395 --> 25:09.614
Anne.

25:21.713 --> 25:24.455
I've been praying,
Tancrede.

25:24.499 --> 25:26.979
For us.

25:27.023 --> 25:29.417
And I've come to believe
that if God sees fit

25:29.460 --> 25:34.509
for us to continue
to draw breath into our lungs,

25:34.552 --> 25:37.033
we should start
a new life.

25:40.732 --> 25:42.560
Together.

26:09.457 --> 26:12.503
You draw them
to the far tent.

26:12.547 --> 26:13.939
We'll do the rest.

26:16.377 --> 26:17.377
Godspeed to you,
brothers.

26:17.378 --> 26:19.293
And to you.

26:28.650 --> 26:30.608
Do you have news for your king?

26:33.002 --> 26:36.223
Landry managed to
escape my grasp.

26:36.266 --> 26:39.704
I am aware of that.

26:39.748 --> 26:43.317
I'm sorry, Father.

26:43.360 --> 26:45.319
But I did kill
the child.

26:47.582 --> 26:51.542
Well done, my son.

26:51.586 --> 26:53.501
And no apology needed.

26:53.544 --> 26:57.157
The child
is what matters most.

26:57.200 --> 26:59.681
Yes, Father.

27:01.726 --> 27:06.427
Before he escaped me,
Landry and I had words.

27:08.255 --> 27:11.954
What words were these?

27:11.997 --> 27:14.696
Evil words.

27:17.177 --> 27:19.831
Lies and tricks.

27:22.269 --> 27:25.489
As if the devil himself
held parlay with me.

27:27.404 --> 27:30.712
Landry's a monster.

27:30.755 --> 27:33.367
A demon who needs to be
sent back to hell

27:33.410 --> 27:36.848
so Queen Joan may
rest in peace...

27:36.892 --> 27:39.286
and you and I
can move on.

27:39.329 --> 27:45.074
But I swear by all that's holy,
I will see the wretch

27:45.117 --> 27:49.513
that murdered my mother pay
for his awful crimes.

27:49.557 --> 27:52.560
Rest and heal,
my beloved prince.

27:52.603 --> 27:55.258
You shall have your
chance soon enough.

28:05.790 --> 28:07.183
Princess Margaret?

28:08.358 --> 28:09.577
Princess Margaret!

28:17.324 --> 28:18.586
What are you
staring at, woman?

28:18.629 --> 28:20.849
Did you not know
that your mistress

28:20.892 --> 28:22.590
is the Princess of Love?

29:21.649 --> 29:23.520
Fire!

29:23.564 --> 29:26.088
Fire at the north end of camp!

29:31.354 --> 29:33.748
Templars in the camp!

29:35.967 --> 29:38.056
Drop your swords!

29:56.727 --> 29:59.817
What you waiting for,
your balls to drop?

30:25.713 --> 30:28.063
No, no, no. No.

30:28.106 --> 30:29.345
We must go back
for our brothers.

30:29.369 --> 30:31.066
We can't, Landry.
We can't!

30:31.109 --> 30:32.633
Get back inside now,

30:32.676 --> 30:34.156
before the sally port's
discovered.

30:34.199 --> 30:36.506
We've no choice.

30:36.550 --> 30:38.247
Come on, brothers.

30:54.785 --> 30:56.439
- How did it go?
- Perfectly.

30:56.483 --> 30:59.268
We waited for her handmaid,
as you instructed.

30:59.311 --> 31:01.191
She was quite horrified
at the indecent tableau.

31:01.226 --> 31:02.314
And Margaret?

31:02.358 --> 31:04.708
Sleeping like a baby.

31:04.752 --> 31:08.320
I have a gift
for you both.

31:08.364 --> 31:15.240
Borromean rings, meant to
represent the Holy Trinity.

31:15.284 --> 31:18.200
Most appropriate for the three
of us, don't you think?

31:18.243 --> 31:21.943
I had them inscribed.

31:21.986 --> 31:23.814
"Gautier."

31:23.858 --> 31:25.860
"Philippe."

31:25.903 --> 31:29.080
And "Isabella."

31:30.734 --> 31:34.085
The ship is the Saint Marie,
out of Dieppe.

31:34.129 --> 31:37.393
Ride hard and be at
the Harfleur docks by dawn.

31:45.880 --> 31:50.885
Until we meet again,
my loves.

31:55.019 --> 31:58.632
Bastards!

32:00.721 --> 32:03.027
Next time you face me
in single combat,

32:03.071 --> 32:06.248
like men, and I will
gut you like hogs!

32:09.599 --> 32:12.036
You cowards!

32:36.060 --> 32:38.933
Your two comrades
are dead,

32:38.976 --> 32:42.545
and your former Grandmaster,
the great Jacques De Molay,

32:42.589 --> 32:47.637
well, he doesn't look quite so
impressive anymore, does he?

32:48.595 --> 32:51.815
He paid the price
for his obstinance,

32:51.859 --> 32:56.167
thanks to the efforts of
my esteemed inquisitor.

33:02.347 --> 33:06.874
So tell me,
Kelton Fitz Laval,

33:06.917 --> 33:10.573
what price are
you prepared to pay?

33:10.617 --> 33:13.402
Hands?

33:13.445 --> 33:16.231
Feet?

33:16.274 --> 33:18.625
Balls?

33:18.668 --> 33:20.583
Cock?

33:23.325 --> 33:25.675
The list goes on.

33:35.293 --> 33:38.993
Shh, shh, shh, shh,
shh, shh, shh.

33:39.036 --> 33:42.257
Where is
the sally port hidden?

33:55.096 --> 33:57.228
What do you think
England is like?

33:57.272 --> 33:59.666
Cold and miserable,
from what I hear.

33:59.709 --> 34:01.232
But fear not.

34:01.276 --> 34:02.645
We'll be warm
in Isabella's embrace.

34:02.669 --> 34:05.323
Of that I am sure.

34:05.367 --> 34:08.630
Drop your swords
and surrender to the king

34:08.675 --> 34:11.112
on charges of high treason.

34:11.155 --> 34:12.940
We are innocent
of any such charge.

34:12.983 --> 34:14.289
We have no quarrel
with you, sir.

34:14.331 --> 34:16.596
There must be some
misunderstanding.

34:26.996 --> 34:29.521
No!
Philippe!

34:44.014 --> 34:46.495
Brother Vasant.

34:46.538 --> 34:47.975
Brother Landry.

34:53.023 --> 34:56.157
Losing Kelton hurts.

34:56.199 --> 34:59.116
But he may yet live,
and if not,

34:59.160 --> 35:03.425
then he gave his life
to defend us all.

35:08.473 --> 35:13.261
Keeping a close eye on
the men in your ranks, eh?

35:13.304 --> 35:16.394
I guess you really were
master of the Paris Temple.

35:22.444 --> 35:25.186
I have
a confession to make.

35:37.764 --> 35:39.722
I don't belong here.

35:39.766 --> 35:40.854
Of course you do.

35:40.897 --> 35:43.900
No, you don't
understand.

35:43.944 --> 35:47.774
I was never a Knight.

35:47.817 --> 35:51.560
My name
isn't even Vasant.

35:51.603 --> 35:54.955
What are you saying?

35:54.998 --> 35:58.132
I met the real Vasant
on the road.

35:58.175 --> 36:01.222
He'd been ambushed
by brigands,

36:01.265 --> 36:04.225
mortally wounded,
and left for dead.

36:04.268 --> 36:07.881
I buried
the poor bugger,

36:07.924 --> 36:10.318
took his horse and sword,
figured he wasn't

36:10.361 --> 36:13.495
needing those anymore,

36:13.538 --> 36:16.890
and then completed his journey
to the Chartres Temple.

36:16.933 --> 36:22.634
He told me of this
place before he died.

36:22.678 --> 36:27.291
And somehow I fooled everyone
into thinking I was he.

36:27.335 --> 36:31.121
You've proven yourself

36:31.165 --> 36:35.125
time and time again

36:35.169 --> 36:38.259
with your devotion...

36:40.043 --> 36:42.263
...your bravery,
fighting skills.

36:44.091 --> 36:47.224
You do belong
here, Vasant...

36:47.268 --> 36:49.574
or whatever
your real name is.

36:49.618 --> 36:52.316
Your secret
is safe with me.

36:58.540 --> 37:03.501
Most every man lives
a lie at some point.

37:04.981 --> 37:06.722
Be thankful you and I
are among the few

37:06.766 --> 37:08.332
blessed by God

37:08.376 --> 37:11.335
with a second chance
to live the truth.

37:49.634 --> 37:52.942
- Come with me, quickly.
- Where?

37:52.986 --> 37:56.728
Someplace safe.

38:00.428 --> 38:02.996
You traitorous
bastard!

38:05.172 --> 38:06.956
Aah!

38:56.092 --> 38:59.095
Keep silent, and you hide
here until I come back.

39:28.864 --> 39:32.868
Tell Tancrede that I love him.
That I've always loved him.

39:32.912 --> 39:36.306
You can tell him yourself
when all this is over.

39:38.656 --> 39:40.963
I need you
to listen carefully.

39:41.007 --> 39:44.053
If we lose this battle
and I don't return,

39:44.097 --> 39:45.489
this is what
you must do.

40:49.423 --> 40:51.860
Aaaah!

42:24.170 --> 42:26.128
Templars!

42:26.172 --> 42:30.132
Templars, lay down your weapons,
or Landry dies!

42:30.176 --> 42:33.483
No! Keep fighting!
Keep fighting!

42:33.527 --> 42:35.355
Fight!

42:43.406 --> 42:46.148
We were your brothers!

42:48.933 --> 42:50.761
Your brothers!

42:56.419 --> 43:00.031
No.

43:00.075 --> 43:02.208
No! No!

43:02.251 --> 43:03.470
No!

43:06.255 --> 43:07.517
No!

43:31.062 --> 43:35.197
Landry du Lauzon,
traitor to France,

43:35.241 --> 43:39.636
murderer, heretic,

43:39.680 --> 43:42.161
I'm bringing you home.
