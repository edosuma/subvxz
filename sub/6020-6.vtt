00:01.276 --> 00:04.586
I started out working in mortgage
bonds, but I found that so limiting.

00:04.756 --> 00:07.509
My friend Kramer and I were
discussing that the other day.

00:07.676 --> 00:09.428
He was with Brandt-Leland
for a while.

00:11.516 --> 00:14.588
Well, then my mentor suggested
that I move into equities.

00:14.756 --> 00:16.314
Best move I ever made.

00:16.476 --> 00:18.307
- Mentor? You mean your boss?
- No, no, no.

00:18.476 --> 00:20.228
Cynthia's a successful
businesswoman...

00:20.396 --> 00:22.432
...who's taken me under her wing.

00:22.596 --> 00:25.554
- So Cynthia's your mentor?
- And I'm her protégé.

00:26.036 --> 00:27.515
You must have someone like that.

00:27.676 --> 00:29.746
You know, who guides you
in your career path.

00:29.916 --> 00:32.509
Well, I like Gabe Kaplan.

00:37.636 --> 00:40.309
I still don't understand this.
Abby has a mentor?

00:40.476 --> 00:43.309
Yes. And the mentor
advises the protégé.

00:43.476 --> 00:45.387
Is there any money involved?

00:45.556 --> 00:47.945
- No.
- So, what's in it for the mentor?

00:48.116 --> 00:50.346
Respect, admiration, prestige.

00:53.796 --> 00:56.390
Would the protégé
pick up stuff for the mentor?

00:56.556 --> 01:00.629
I suppose if it was on the protégé's
way to the mentor, they might.

01:01.036 --> 01:02.469
Laundry? Dry cleaning?

01:03.116 --> 01:05.152
It's not a valet, it's a protégé.

01:05.796 --> 01:06.945
All right.

01:07.396 --> 01:11.628
Listen, I gotta get some reading done.
You mind if I do this here?

01:11.796 --> 01:14.435
I can't concentrate in my apartment.

01:14.996 --> 01:16.668
- "Risk management"?
- Yeah.

01:16.876 --> 01:18.992
Steinbrenner wants everyone
in the front office...

01:19.156 --> 01:21.670
...to give a lecture
in their area of business expertise.

01:21.836 --> 01:23.906
What makes them think
you're a risk-management expert?

01:24.316 --> 01:26.625
I guess it's on my résumé.

01:30.316 --> 01:33.513
- Hello?
- Please hold for Elaine Benes.

01:34.516 --> 01:39.226
You know what? I can't do this.
I can't read books anymore.

01:39.396 --> 01:41.148
Books on tape
have ruined me, Jerry.

01:41.316 --> 01:45.229
I need that nice voice. This book
has my voice. I hate my voice.

01:45.396 --> 01:48.911
- So get this book on tape.
- You can't. It's a textbook.

01:49.076 --> 01:51.795
Hey, Jer, are you going
to this Bob Sacamano party?

01:51.956 --> 01:53.753
Am I going? It was three nights ago.

01:53.916 --> 01:57.147
What? You're kidding.
I just got this invitation today.

01:57.316 --> 02:01.229
Oh, I was so excited.
It's really a beautiful invitation.

02:01.396 --> 02:03.546
Oh, it was a lovely affair.

02:04.236 --> 02:05.635
Oh, wait a minute.

02:05.796 --> 02:11.348
This postmark is three weeks old.
Man, this happens all the time.

02:11.516 --> 02:13.905
Janine, who the hell
runs the mailroom?

02:14.076 --> 02:16.271
- Eddie Sherman.
- All right. Send him up here.

02:16.436 --> 02:19.348
- You gonna do a little yelling?
- I'm gonna do a little firing.

02:19.516 --> 02:22.826
That is so cool.
Can you put me on the speaker?

02:22.996 --> 02:25.510
Oh, yeah. Sure.

02:25.956 --> 02:27.230
Give me a break.

02:35.516 --> 02:37.074
Hey, Copernicus.

02:40.156 --> 02:43.626
- Eddie Sherman is here.
- Oh, great. Send him in.

02:49.636 --> 02:53.549
- You wanted to see me?
- Eddie, yes.

02:53.716 --> 02:57.311
I am so sorry, but I'm afraid
we're gonna have to...

02:59.236 --> 03:01.192
...promote you.

03:03.116 --> 03:04.390
So, what did you say?

03:04.556 --> 03:06.911
Well, I called him
all the way up to my office...

03:07.076 --> 03:09.067
...so I had to tell him
something important.

03:09.996 --> 03:12.749
So I promoted him.

03:14.116 --> 03:16.630
- What? What did you...?
- Copywriter.

03:17.556 --> 03:19.228
He's writing copy?

03:19.636 --> 03:24.266
Well, it can't be any worse than the
pointless drivel we normally churn out.

03:27.156 --> 03:28.828
Check it out.

03:28.996 --> 03:32.671
- "Jewish singles night"?
- I expect you both to be there.

03:32.876 --> 03:35.231
- I'm not Jewish.
- Well, neither am I.

03:35.396 --> 03:39.275
- Well, why are you going?
- I'm not. I'm running it.

03:39.876 --> 03:42.310
- What are you talking about?
- Lomez usually runs it...

03:42.476 --> 03:43.875
...but he's in the Everglades.

03:45.116 --> 03:47.391
- Lomez is Jewish?
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

03:47.556 --> 03:50.628
Orthodox, Jerry. Old school.

03:52.196 --> 03:55.154
At the Knights of Columbus?

03:55.636 --> 03:58.150
Yeah. Frank Costanza's
getting me a room in his lodge.

03:58.316 --> 04:00.955
Jerry, I'm really counting on you
to come to this.

04:01.116 --> 04:02.390
- Kramer...
- Jerry, look.

04:02.556 --> 04:04.387
I'm cooking all the food myself.

04:04.556 --> 04:09.107
"A tempting schmeer
of authentic Jewish delicacies."

04:10.596 --> 04:12.473
Do you like tsimmes?

04:14.756 --> 04:17.224
My mentor says
the duck is outstanding here.

04:17.636 --> 04:20.469
I'm not really a duck fan.
The skin seems sort of human.

04:21.916 --> 04:24.305
Oh, look who's here. Cynthia.

04:24.476 --> 04:26.068
- Hello, Abby.
- Hello.

04:26.236 --> 04:28.147
Jerry, this is Cynthia Pearlman,
my mentor.

04:28.316 --> 04:31.035
- Hello.
- Hi, Jerry. Nice to finally meet you.

04:31.196 --> 04:32.788
Join us. We can pull up a chair.

04:32.956 --> 04:35.390
Well, great.
My boyfriend's just parking the car.

04:35.756 --> 04:39.146
Actually, Jerry, you might know him.
He's a comic too.

04:39.316 --> 04:41.830
- No kidding.
- Kenny Bania.

04:41.996 --> 04:43.224
Bania?

04:44.236 --> 04:47.069
Hey, Jerry. How's it going?

04:47.236 --> 04:49.796
You gonna join us for dinner?
The duck here is the best.

04:49.956 --> 04:51.105
The best, Jerry.

04:55.436 --> 04:58.109
Excuse me.
I'm sorry to bother you.

04:58.276 --> 05:00.665
I noticed that you have
a textbook on tape.

05:00.836 --> 05:02.155
May I ask where you got that?

05:02.316 --> 05:05.069
Reading for the Blind.
They can get any book on tape.

05:05.236 --> 05:07.796
I tell you, I am hooked
on these books on tape.

05:07.956 --> 05:11.505
Tell me about it. These things
have ruined me for Braille.

05:14.436 --> 05:15.630
Reading for the Blind?

05:15.956 --> 05:18.550
I take an eye test, I flunk it.
Next thing you know...

05:18.716 --> 05:22.425
...I am swinging to the sweet sounds
of risk management.

05:23.676 --> 05:27.271
- So I finally met the mentor.
- What's she like? lmpressive?

05:27.436 --> 05:30.633
Oh, yeah. She's dating Bania.

05:31.916 --> 05:33.395
- Bania?
- Yeah.

05:33.556 --> 05:37.344
I had to spend two hours at dinner
last night with that specimen.

05:37.956 --> 05:39.309
- What'd you have?
- Chicken.

05:39.476 --> 05:41.034
How could she look up
to a person...

05:41.196 --> 05:43.426
...who voluntarily
spends time with Bania?

05:43.596 --> 05:44.790
- Marsala?
- Piccata.

05:44.956 --> 05:47.675
If anything,
I should be dating a mentor...

05:47.836 --> 05:51.033
...and Bania should be
setting pins at a bowling alley.

05:51.716 --> 05:54.833
- All right. I got a test to fail.
- Hey, good luck with that.

05:54.996 --> 05:57.146
Thanks. Dad.

05:57.316 --> 05:59.307
What are you,
in an athletic sweat suit?

05:59.476 --> 06:00.670
What are you doing here?

06:00.836 --> 06:02.827
Came to get his check
for the banquet hall.

06:02.996 --> 06:08.707
You know, I got 183 responses.
Oh, it's gonna be a rager.

06:09.236 --> 06:12.592
Kramer, how are you gonna cook
Jewish delicacies for 183 people?

06:12.916 --> 06:16.147
You're right. That's a lot of pupiks.

06:16.756 --> 06:18.872
Frank, you know anybody
who can help me cook?

06:19.036 --> 06:20.674
Cook? No. I don't know any cooks.

06:20.836 --> 06:23.111
I don't know anything
about cooking!

06:24.636 --> 06:25.910
What's the matter with him?

06:26.276 --> 06:29.825
My dad was a cook
during the Korean War.

06:29.996 --> 06:32.351
Something very bad happened.

06:32.516 --> 06:34.666
Ever since,
you can't get him near a kitchen.

06:34.836 --> 06:36.906
- Shell-shocked?
- Oh, yeah.

06:37.076 --> 06:39.351
But that has nothing to do with it.

06:41.116 --> 06:43.391
Good work, guys.
That ought to do it for today.

06:43.556 --> 06:44.750
- Alrighty?
- Wait.

06:44.916 --> 06:47.555
You didn't ask me about my ideas.

06:47.876 --> 06:50.106
Oh, Eddie, well, it's your first day.

06:50.276 --> 06:53.154
- I'm ready.
- Okay.

06:55.396 --> 06:59.389
"It's a hot night. The mind races.

07:00.876 --> 07:02.389
You think about your knife...

07:04.476 --> 07:07.866
...the only friend
who hasn't betrayed you.

07:09.036 --> 07:12.585
The only friend
who won't be dead by sun-up.

07:15.076 --> 07:20.673
Sleep tight, mates,
in your quilted chambray nightshirts."

07:26.556 --> 07:29.116
What am I gonna do?
He is a disaster.

07:29.276 --> 07:33.906
Well, if he's doing that bad, maybe
he's in line for another promotion.

07:34.676 --> 07:37.474
You know what?
You are exactly right.

07:37.636 --> 07:39.945
That is what I should do.
I should promote him.

07:40.356 --> 07:43.871
I'll give him another office
on another floor, and he can sit there...

07:44.036 --> 07:47.346
...with his nice title
and his bayonet...

07:47.516 --> 07:49.905
...and stop freaking me out.

07:53.156 --> 07:54.987
Nothing at all.

07:56.836 --> 07:59.396
Well, George,
your vision is quite impaired.

08:00.916 --> 08:03.953
If you'll just sign this
insurance form. Here's a pen.

08:05.000 --> 08:11.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

08:13.276 --> 08:15.232
You're a very handsome man,
by the way.

08:21.436 --> 08:24.189
What the hell is going on here?

08:26.956 --> 08:28.674
Look out!

08:32.916 --> 08:36.431
- What are you doing?
- I got three kitchens going.

08:36.836 --> 08:41.193
I got brisket going at Newman's,
I got kugel working at Mrs. Zanfino's...

08:41.356 --> 08:42.674
...and this is kreplach.

08:42.836 --> 08:45.714
Here, try some of this.

08:45.876 --> 08:49.949
- No, I don't want to.
- Eat, eat, you're skin and bones.

08:53.556 --> 08:56.514
- Oh, this is awful.
- Oh, Jerry, it's kreplach.

08:56.676 --> 08:59.065
It's an acquired taste. Yeah.

09:06.836 --> 09:08.189
Did you follow the recipe?

09:08.356 --> 09:09.994
The recipe was for four to six.

09:10.156 --> 09:13.068
I had to multiply it for 183 people.

09:13.236 --> 09:15.386
I guess I got confused.

09:16.596 --> 09:17.870
It tastes like dirt.

09:18.036 --> 09:20.755
Well, I also dropped it
on the way over.

09:20.916 --> 09:22.907
Jerry, I'm in trouble.
I got no skills.

09:23.076 --> 09:27.513
I can't peel, I can't chop,
I can't grate, I can't mince.

09:27.676 --> 09:29.871
I got no sense of flavour, obviously.

09:31.596 --> 09:32.711
I gotta talk to Frank.

09:32.876 --> 09:34.628
- You can't...
- I gotta talk to him.

09:34.796 --> 09:36.070
I know that he can help me...

09:36.236 --> 09:38.796
I think there's a dead animal
in the elevator.

09:38.956 --> 09:41.231
My stuffed cabbage.

09:44.636 --> 09:47.389
- So great dinner last night.
- Yeah, it was all right.

09:47.556 --> 09:49.945
I told Cynthia we'd double
with her and Bania Saturday...

09:50.116 --> 09:52.311
...and then catch his act.
- No. No.

09:52.476 --> 09:55.468
- No way. No Bania.
- What?

09:55.636 --> 09:58.946
Have you seen his act? He's got
a 12-minute bit about Ovaltine.

09:59.116 --> 10:01.072
He's a pug, a patsy, a hack.

10:01.636 --> 10:03.308
Cynthia would not date a hack.

10:03.476 --> 10:05.467
Would. Does. Is.

10:08.276 --> 10:09.675
Before we get started...

10:09.836 --> 10:11.986
...I am happy to tell you
that Eddie Sherman...

10:12.156 --> 10:14.192
...is no longer writing
for this catalogue.

10:14.356 --> 10:16.392
- It's about time.
- He's upstairs.

10:16.556 --> 10:18.865
I made him director
of corporate development.

10:19.436 --> 10:21.028
You promoted him?

10:21.196 --> 10:22.515
Well, no. I would hardly...

10:22.676 --> 10:26.908
- I bust my hump every day.
- Relax.

10:27.076 --> 10:30.910
As far as I'm concerned,
you and your deranged protégé...

10:31.076 --> 10:33.795
...can run the catalogue
by yourselves.

10:33.956 --> 10:35.435
I quit!

10:35.596 --> 10:36.790
- I'm with him.
- Me too.

10:36.956 --> 10:39.072
What? Hey.

10:39.476 --> 10:42.912
Hey. Hey!

10:44.676 --> 10:46.268
Chapter one.

10:46.436 --> 10:50.429
In order to manage risk,
we must first understand risk.

10:50.796 --> 10:52.514
How do you spot risk?

10:52.676 --> 10:56.510
How do you av oid risk,
and what mak es it so risky?

10:56.676 --> 10:59.588
- This guy sounds like me.
- To understand risk, we must first...

10:59.756 --> 11:01.747
...define risk. Risk...
- This is horrible.

11:01.916 --> 11:04.430
...existed virtually...
- Stop it. Stop it. Shut up!

11:05.316 --> 11:07.432
Come on, Frank, I need you.

11:07.596 --> 11:09.552
I mean, the war was 50 years ago.

11:09.716 --> 11:13.948
In my mind,
there's a war still going on.

11:14.116 --> 11:15.549
All right, what happened?

11:15.716 --> 11:17.627
What is it that you can't get over?

11:30.316 --> 11:33.467
Inchon, Korea, 1950.

11:33.636 --> 11:37.151
I was the best cook
Uncle Sam ever saw.

11:37.476 --> 11:40.991
Slinging hash for the fighting 103rd.

11:41.156 --> 11:44.751
As we marched north,
our supply lines were getting thin.

11:44.916 --> 11:47.384
Well, one day,
a couple of GI's found a crate.

11:47.556 --> 11:50.673
Inside was 600 pounds
of prime Texas steer.

11:50.836 --> 11:53.145
At least, it once was prime.

11:53.316 --> 11:55.193
The use date
was three weeks past.

11:56.036 --> 11:59.312
But I was arrogant. I was brash.

11:59.756 --> 12:03.032
I thought if I used
just the right spices...

12:05.276 --> 12:07.392
...cooked it long enough...

12:10.036 --> 12:11.230
What happened?

12:11.396 --> 12:14.433
I went too far. I overseasoned it.

12:17.956 --> 12:20.106
Men were keeling over
all around me.

12:21.556 --> 12:24.548
I can still hear
the retching and screaming.

12:31.876 --> 12:33.867
Frank!

12:34.516 --> 12:39.226
I sent 16 of my own men
to the latrines that night.

12:40.876 --> 12:42.355
They were just boys.

12:42.516 --> 12:44.711
Frank, you were a boy too.

12:44.876 --> 12:48.186
And it was war.
That was a crazy time for everyone.

12:48.396 --> 12:50.193
Tell that to Bobby Colby.

12:50.796 --> 12:55.916
All that kid wanted to do was go home.
Well, he went home, all right.

12:56.236 --> 12:58.750
With a crater in his colon
the size of a cutlet.

12:59.836 --> 13:02.555
They had to sit him on a cork
for the 18-hour flight home.

13:02.716 --> 13:07.107
Frank, now listen to me. Two hundred
Jewish singles need you.

13:07.276 --> 13:09.551
This is your chance
to make it all right again.

13:09.956 --> 13:14.029
No. No. I'll never cook again.

13:14.196 --> 13:16.994
Never! Now get out of my house!

13:17.676 --> 13:20.793
Out. Get out. Go.

13:25.516 --> 13:28.189
So you saw Bania's act.

13:28.756 --> 13:31.145
He got two minutes
into that Ovaltine thing...

13:31.316 --> 13:33.784
...and I just couldn't take it anymore.

13:34.316 --> 13:38.070
I told you. It's like getting beaten
with a bag of oranges.

13:38.476 --> 13:40.512
Why is he so obsessed
with Ovaltine?

13:40.676 --> 13:44.510
He just thinks that anything
that dissolves in milk is funny.

13:44.676 --> 13:48.988
Anyway, Cynthia and I got into
this big argument afterwards...

13:49.316 --> 13:51.830
...and I think it's over.
- No more mentor?

13:51.996 --> 13:55.466
- Looks that way.
- At least you and I are okay again.

13:55.636 --> 13:57.354
Actually, I was kind of thinking...

13:57.516 --> 14:00.110
...that maybe we shouldn't
see each other for a while.

14:00.276 --> 14:01.311
Why?

14:01.476 --> 14:04.434
Well, I'm feeling a little disoriented.

14:04.596 --> 14:07.064
It's just weird for me
not to have an advisor.

14:07.236 --> 14:09.875
I can tell you what to do.

14:11.076 --> 14:13.271
- It's more than that.
- I can tell you what to think.

14:14.276 --> 14:15.709
I need someone I can trust.

14:20.036 --> 14:23.312
I got a big problem here, Jerry.
The tapes are worthless.

14:23.476 --> 14:26.070
Kind of in the middle
of something here, George.

14:33.716 --> 14:36.025
- George.
- I gotta run anyway.

14:36.196 --> 14:39.108
I can't believe you feel
you really need a mentor.

14:39.276 --> 14:43.064
I just need someone who can give me
some kind of direction.

14:44.556 --> 14:46.353
I'll see you.

14:46.516 --> 14:48.108
Yeah, see you.

14:48.276 --> 14:51.791
- So, what's your problem?
- No problem.

14:54.116 --> 14:58.428
I think I got something here
for the Bengalese galoshes.

15:00.516 --> 15:04.270
"It's tough keeping your feet dry...

15:04.436 --> 15:07.553
...when you're kicking in a skull."

15:08.996 --> 15:13.035
You know, Eddie,
that might be just a tad harsh.

15:13.196 --> 15:15.073
For women's wear.

15:17.116 --> 15:19.949
Well, I'm not married to it.

15:20.596 --> 15:25.545
Well, in that case,
why don't we take the phrase:

15:26.276 --> 15:27.709
"Kicking in a skull"...

15:27.876 --> 15:30.310
...and we tweak it.

15:30.476 --> 15:34.435
You know, just a hair,
to something like what?

15:34.596 --> 15:38.748
Like "strolling through
a dewy meadow."

15:39.596 --> 15:41.951
Dewy meadow.

15:42.916 --> 15:44.269
Here's your omelette.

15:46.796 --> 15:49.629
- It's dry.
- That's the way I always make it.

15:50.516 --> 15:52.507
Well, it sucks.

15:54.436 --> 15:56.347
What did you say?

15:56.556 --> 16:00.231
Your meatloaf is mushy,
your salmon croquettes are oily...

16:00.396 --> 16:03.627
...and your eggplant parmigiana
is a disgrace to this house!

16:03.796 --> 16:08.506
Well, that's too bad, because I'm
the only one who cooks around here.

16:08.676 --> 16:11.986
Not anymore. Give me that spatula.

16:15.956 --> 16:18.516
I'm back, baby!

16:20.596 --> 16:23.588
You're sure, with your schedule,
you'd have time for a protégé?

16:23.956 --> 16:27.471
I'll make time. Because, Abby,
I was once like you.

16:27.636 --> 16:29.115
Wide-eyed, naive.

16:29.276 --> 16:32.348
I didn't know the first thing
about a subject as fundamental...

16:32.516 --> 16:36.065
...as risk management.

16:36.236 --> 16:38.431
I'm not familiar with it.
You'll have to explain.

16:38.596 --> 16:40.268
I'll tell you what.

16:40.436 --> 16:42.347
Why don't you read this book...

16:42.516 --> 16:45.952
...and let's just see
if you can explain it to me.

16:46.516 --> 16:48.825
- All right.
- Okay.

16:49.796 --> 16:50.990
Hey, Jerry.

16:51.396 --> 16:53.785
- Hey, Bania.
- Did you hear what happened?

16:53.956 --> 16:56.675
The mentor saw my act.
She dumped me.

16:56.836 --> 16:58.269
Oh, that's a tough one.

16:58.436 --> 17:02.111
Maybe she's right.
Maybe I am a complete hack.

17:02.316 --> 17:04.671
I'm the absolute worst.
The worst, Jerry.

17:04.836 --> 17:07.589
Well, it's just that you got
so many things with the milk.

17:07.756 --> 17:10.316
You got that Bosco bit,
you got your Nestlé's Quik bit.

17:10.476 --> 17:12.034
By the time you get to Ovaltine...

17:12.195 --> 17:14.790
You think you can give me
a hand with my material?

17:21.556 --> 17:24.388
- You still need a cook?
- Oh, yeah. Come on in, Frank.

17:24.556 --> 17:26.194
- You got T-Fal?
- Calphalon.

17:26.356 --> 17:29.314
- No. Follow me.
- Oh, yeah.

17:30.516 --> 17:31.949
Try that.

17:34.316 --> 17:36.511
"Why do they call it Ovaltine?

17:36.676 --> 17:39.748
The mug is round, the jar is round.

17:39.916 --> 17:42.225
They should call it Roundtine."

17:43.836 --> 17:46.794
That's gold, Jerry. Gold.

17:47.556 --> 17:53.791
Let's just replace "hail of shrapnel"
and "scar tissue"...

17:54.276 --> 17:58.588
...with "string of pearls"
and "raspberry scones."

18:02.036 --> 18:03.754
George Costanza is your mentor?

18:03.916 --> 18:05.952
Yeah. He's great.

18:06.116 --> 18:07.629
I am learning so much.

18:07.796 --> 18:10.913
About what? How to calculate
5 percent of a restaurant check?

18:11.996 --> 18:13.475
You know what your problem is?

18:13.636 --> 18:17.026
You just have no respect
for the protégé-mentor relationship.

18:17.196 --> 18:20.666
As a matter of fact,
I happen to have a protégé of my own.

18:22.436 --> 18:25.109
- Who?
- A Mr. Kenneth Bania.

18:25.276 --> 18:26.914
Bania?

18:27.836 --> 18:30.396
I'm gonna mentor
this kid to the top.

18:30.556 --> 18:34.629
Well, I don't think I wanna date
a mentor whose protégé is a hack.

18:34.796 --> 18:37.947
I don't think I wanna date a protégé
whose mentor is a Costanza.

18:39.876 --> 18:40.911
I don't know how...

18:41.076 --> 18:43.112
...but there's some chemistry
between us.

18:43.276 --> 18:45.471
We turned out
one hell of a catalogue.

18:45.996 --> 18:47.190
Cool.

18:48.316 --> 18:50.511
Hey, Ed, let me ask you something.

18:50.676 --> 18:55.033
What's with the fatigues
and all the psychotic imagery, huh?

18:55.756 --> 18:57.030
I don't wanna talk about it.

18:57.196 --> 19:00.666
Come on. Don't be a baby.

19:01.436 --> 19:05.509
I went out on a couple of dates
with this woman.

19:05.676 --> 19:07.826
I thought she really liked me.

19:08.396 --> 19:12.230
And then things kind of cooled off.

19:14.116 --> 19:15.310
That's it?

19:15.796 --> 19:18.435
Well, it's tough
meeting somebody you like...

19:18.596 --> 19:20.188
...let alone somebody Jewish.

19:27.716 --> 19:29.229
This food is fantastic.

19:29.396 --> 19:32.991
- Have you tried the hamantaschen?
- I can't get off the kishkes.

19:33.156 --> 19:34.953
- Hey, Jerry.
- Bania.

19:35.116 --> 19:36.674
I just stopped by to thank you.

19:36.836 --> 19:39.714
That risk-management stuff
you wrote for me is killer.

19:40.116 --> 19:41.515
Risk management?

19:41.676 --> 19:43.906
It's gold, Jerry. Gold.

19:44.076 --> 19:47.148
I got all these corporate gigs,
and even Cynthia took me back.

19:47.316 --> 19:48.715
You went from the mailroom...

19:48.876 --> 19:51.549
...to director of corporate
development in two days?

19:52.396 --> 19:54.671
- That's right.
- How much are they paying you?

19:54.836 --> 19:56.064
I'll double it.

19:58.156 --> 20:01.831
- These latkes are going like hotcakes.
- Where's the powdered sugar?

20:02.436 --> 20:03.994
You know, you could take a break.

20:04.156 --> 20:08.195
No breaks. I feel reborn.
I'm like a phoenix rising from Arizona.

20:09.476 --> 20:10.625
Quitting?

20:10.796 --> 20:14.266
I can't churn out
that pointless drivel anymore.

20:14.436 --> 20:17.587
What...? You can't quit.
You're all I've got.

20:17.756 --> 20:19.747
I need you.

20:21.156 --> 20:22.874
Gross.

20:36.196 --> 20:37.675
No!

20:38.156 --> 20:40.954
No! Don't eat it. It's no good.

20:41.116 --> 20:44.347
- No good. No good. No way.
- Frank, stop it.

20:44.516 --> 20:47.826
- Stop...
- No. No. No.

20:47.996 --> 20:49.668
Frank!

20:55.916 --> 20:59.955
Our next speaker is George Costanza
on the subject of risk management.

21:07.636 --> 21:09.467
"Ovaltine.

21:20.116 --> 21:22.505
Have you ever had this stuff?

21:25.036 --> 21:27.675
Why do they call it Ovaltine?

21:32.556 --> 21:34.433
They should call it Roundtine.

21:36.236 --> 21:38.545
You know what I'm talking about."

21:39.956 --> 21:42.311
He's my protégé.

21:43.305 --> 21:49.516
