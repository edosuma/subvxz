WEBVTT

00:02.330 --> 00:04.218
- I hallucinated
that I killed her.

00:04.270 --> 00:06.261
- (Jack): Will Graham, you're
under arrest for murder.

00:06.300 --> 00:09.098
- Four of the lures are made
from materials Including
human remains.

00:09.140 --> 00:15.033
- According to the evidence,
I killed Abigail Hobbs.
- I feel wounded.

00:15.080 --> 00:18.208
- Guess you dodged
a bullet with me.
- I kept pushing him

00:18.250 --> 00:22.414
because he was saving lives.
- I told you not to put him
out there!

00:22.450 --> 00:27.353
- I didn't kill any of them,
and somebody is making sure
that no one believes me.

00:27.390 --> 00:30.257
- You catch these killers
by getting into their heads,

00:30.290 --> 00:32.224
but you also allow them
into your own.

00:32.260 --> 00:36.128
I'm trying to help you, Will.
- I know who I am.
I'm not so sure

00:36.170 --> 00:39.799
that I know who you are anymore.
- Are you a killer, Will?

00:39.840 --> 00:43.537
- Will...
(gunshot)

00:43.570 --> 00:46.209
- Hello, Will.
- Hello, Dr. Lecter.

01:47.940 --> 01:50.135
(both grunting)

02:16.370 --> 02:18.827
(Jack yelling)

02:34.750 --> 02:36.388
- Oh!

02:56.370 --> 02:58.406
Ah!

03:16.530 --> 03:18.418
(yelling)

03:53.460 --> 03:56.520
(classmal piano musnc)

04:34.770 --> 04:37.739
- This course is called
mukozuke -

04:37.770 --> 04:39.499
seasonal sashimi,

04:39.540 --> 04:42.839
sea urchin, water clam,
and squid.

04:45.810 --> 04:47.368
- Kaiseki -

04:47.420 --> 04:49.388
a Japanese art form
that honors

04:49.420 --> 04:53.379
the taste and aesthetic
of what we eat.
- Well,

04:53.420 --> 04:56.014
I almost feel guilty
about eating it.

04:56.060 --> 04:58.585
- I never feel guilty
eating anything.

05:06.130 --> 05:07.666
-Mmm.

05:07.700 --> 05:10.737
I can't quite place
the fish.

05:10.770 --> 05:12.806
- He was a flounder.

05:18.550 --> 05:20.518
I last prepared this meal
for my Aunt

05:20.550 --> 05:22.108
Murasaki,

05:22.150 --> 05:24.983
under similarly
unfortunate circumstances.

05:25.020 --> 05:27.659
- Well, what circumstances
were those?

05:27.690 --> 05:30.454
- A loss.

05:32.700 --> 05:35.624
This is a loss.

05:35.660 --> 05:38.128
Will is a loss
and we're mourning a death.

05:38.170 --> 05:41.435
- Will's death is
on me, not you.

05:41.470 --> 05:44.701
- It's on both of us.
- I can't stop thinking that

05:44.740 --> 05:49.609
Will may be convicted of five
murders while I am only
maybe convicted of one.

05:49.650 --> 05:51.675
- Well, you're
not on trial.

05:53.650 --> 05:55.470
-IWi|| be-

05:55.520 --> 05:58.011
in the halls of the FBI.
And so will you.

05:58.050 --> 06:01.554
I mean, according to
Will Graham, this was all you.

06:01.590 --> 06:04.559
- Will was your bloodhound.
You can't ignore where

06:04.590 --> 06:07.593
he points.
- I'm not ignoring it.

06:09.970 --> 06:13.861
- You have to investigate me.
It's in my best interest,
and yours.

06:13.900 --> 06:15.731
- Yes, it is.

06:15.770 --> 06:18.500
But I_ also
can't Ignore

06:18.540 --> 06:20.576
the fact that
my bloodhound went mad

06:20.610 --> 06:22.578
before he pointed
in your direction.

06:22.610 --> 06:27.115
- We can't define Will
only by his maddest edges.

06:27.150 --> 06:31.519
- We can't define Will
at all.

07:09.730 --> 07:12.051
(stag huffing)

07:18.700 --> 07:20.133
(stag huffing)

07:33.520 --> 07:36.785
(inaudible speaking)

07:43.960 --> 07:45.518
- What did you say?

07:45.560 --> 07:48.597
- I said, how does that
make you feel?

07:50.800 --> 07:53.837
- Makes me feel...
like...

07:53.870 --> 07:56.805
I'm sitting
in a dunking tank

07:56.840 --> 08:01.038
and you're lobbing softballs,
hoping to make a splash,

08:01.080 --> 08:03.605
but you keep
missing the target.

08:03.650 --> 08:05.971
- Fortunately, I have time
for a few more lobs.

08:06.010 --> 08:08.171
You are in my hospital.

08:10.290 --> 08:12.656
You're my patient now, Will.

08:14.620 --> 08:17.726
- I'm not talking to you,
Frederick.

08:17.760 --> 08:19.796
(Sigh)

08:22.030 --> 08:24.066
I want to talk
to Dr. Lecter.

08:45.120 --> 08:48.658
***

09:16.920 --> 09:20.151
- According to Dr. Bloom,
you were warned against putting

09:20.190 --> 09:22.954
someone with Will Graham's
issues into the field.

09:25.060 --> 09:26.994
- Yes. That's correct.

09:27.030 --> 09:30.625
- Were you aware that Dr. Bloom
would be filing this report?

09:30.670 --> 09:33.230
- Yes. She told me
what she was going to do.

09:33.270 --> 09:35.238
- Did you advise her

09:35.270 --> 09:38.068
against it?
- I told her she should do

09:38.110 --> 09:41.773
whatever she felt was
necessary. EVIdently,

09:41.810 --> 09:45.371
she felt it was necessary
to file the report.

09:45.410 --> 09:47.810
- These are allegations
of misconduct.

09:47.850 --> 09:50.842
It's damning stuff, Jack.
- I never stated aanhere

09:50.890 --> 09:52.312
that this was misconduct.

09:52.350 --> 09:54.318
In my opinion,
it was a lapse in judgment.

09:54.360 --> 09:56.828
- A lapse in judgment is
misconduct.

09:58.830 --> 10:00.798
Ther_e'll be_ an_internal
Investigation.

10:00.830 --> 10:03.719
- There should be.

10:03.770 --> 10:05.397
- A federal

10:05.430 --> 10:09.764
examiner is someone who arrives
at a battlefield

10:09.810 --> 10:12.608
after the battle
and bayonets the wounded.

10:14.440 --> 10:18.376
You have wounded
Agent Crawford.

10:18.410 --> 10:20.617
Who do you think is gonna be
getting the bayonet?

10:25.090 --> 10:28.958
There is a general desire

10:28.990 --> 10:30.821
to see this go away

10:30.860 --> 10:33.351
quickly and quietly.

10:33.400 --> 10:35.960
In light of that,
Dr. Bloom,

10:36.000 --> 10:40.266
I would greatly appreciate it
if you would recant your report.

10:40.300 --> 10:42.939
- No. Will Graham's life has
been destroyed.

10:42.970 --> 10:46.064
How that happened has to be
a matter of record.

10:46.110 --> 10:48.931
I'm sorry, Jack.

10:52.280 --> 10:54.669
- Dr. Bloom is not
easrly swayed.

10:56.450 --> 10:58.315
- This is going to get ugly.

10:58.350 --> 11:00.386
- It already has.

11:07.030 --> 11:10.022
- Was there a storm?
- Ah, it looks like someone's

11:10.070 --> 11:14.131
blasting beaver dams again.
- Aw, man.

11:19.040 --> 11:21.076
- It smells real bad
down here!

11:21.110 --> 11:23.442
- Probably dead beavers!

11:28.520 --> 11:30.317
(He shouts.)

11:34.160 --> 11:37.948
(shouting)

11:37.990 --> 11:40.322
Buck!

11:43.170 --> 11:45.195
- Get me out of here! Ah!

11:56.950 --> 11:59.248
- Will Graham has asked
to see me.

12:02.850 --> 12:04.841
I would like to see him.

12:07.060 --> 12:10.780
I continue to be curious
about the way he thinks,

12:10.830 --> 12:14.197
despite all
that's happened.

12:14.230 --> 12:16.255
_ - He's still
Influencmg you.

12:19.200 --> 12:24.069
Will Graham asking to see you
betrays his clear intent
to manipulate you.

12:26.040 --> 12:28.076
- And if I agree
to see Will?

12:28.110 --> 12:32.103
- It betrays your clear intent
to manipulate him.

12:35.320 --> 12:36.981
- I miss him.

12:38.920 --> 12:42.310
- You are obsessed
with Will Graham.

12:45.830 --> 12:47.798
- I'm intrigued.

12:47.830 --> 12:51.061
- Obsessively.

12:51.100 --> 12:53.933
And he will
take advantage of that.

12:55.940 --> 12:57.532
- Will is my friend.

12:59.880 --> 13:01.939
- Why?

13:01.980 --> 13:04.005
Why is he your friend?

13:06.850 --> 13:10.013
- He sees his own mentality
as grotesque but useful.

13:12.120 --> 13:14.088
Like a chair of antlers.

13:14.120 --> 13:16.588
He can't repress
who he is.

13:16.620 --> 13:19.180
There's an honesty in that
I admire.

13:19.230 --> 13:23.564
- I imagine there's an honesty
in that you can relate to.

13:25.530 --> 13:29.159
What can't you repress,
Hannibal?

13:44.150 --> 13:47.119
(door buzzer)
(door opening)

13:47.160 --> 13:50.084
(footsteps)

14:05.670 --> 14:07.274
- Hello, Will.

14:09.240 --> 14:10.901
- Dr. Lecter.

14:15.680 --> 14:17.409
- Lost in thought?

14:20.120 --> 14:21.985
- Not lost.

14:22.020 --> 14:25.888
Not anymore.

14:25.930 --> 14:28.194
(Will chuckles softly.)

14:28.230 --> 14:31.461
I used to hear my thoughts
inside my skull

14:31.500 --> 14:34.492
with the same, um...

14:34.540 --> 14:37.202
tone, timbre, accent,

14:37.240 --> 14:40.539
as_ if the words were
coming out of my mouth.

14:42.510 --> 14:45.502
- And now?
- Now...

14:48.280 --> 14:51.181
...my inner voice sounds
like you.

14:54.460 --> 14:58.328
I can't get you
out of my head.

15:00.960 --> 15:04.964
- Friendship can
sometimes involve a breach
of IndIVIdual separateness.

15:05.000 --> 15:08.299
- You're not my friend.

15:08.340 --> 15:12.162
The, uh, light from friendship
won't reach us

15:12.210 --> 15:15.429
for a million years. That's how
far away from friendship we are.

15:17.380 --> 15:19.644
- I imagine it's easier
to believe I am responsible

15:19.680 --> 15:22.240
for those murders than it is
to accept that you are.

15:22.280 --> 15:24.180
- Sure is.

15:28.390 --> 15:33.396
- Your inner voice can provide
a method of taking control
of your behavior,

15:33.430 --> 15:36.297
accepting responsibility
for what you've done.

15:36.330 --> 15:40.562
Giving your thoughts words
encourages clarity.

15:40.600 --> 15:42.636
- Oh, I have clarity.

15:45.240 --> 15:46.662
About you.

15:50.280 --> 15:52.407
- Our conversations, Will,
were only ever about you

15:52.450 --> 15:56.113
opening your eyes to the truth
of who you are.

15:56.150 --> 15:58.209
- What you did to me

15:58.250 --> 16:00.354
is in my head,

16:00.390 --> 16:02.415
and I will find it.

16:07.530 --> 16:10.658
I'm going to remember,
Dr. Lecter,

16:10.700 --> 16:14.238
and when I do,

16:14.270 --> 16:17.034
there will be a reckoning.

16:19.410 --> 16:22.038
- I have huge faith
in you, Will.

16:24.050 --> 16:26.143
I always have.

16:57.810 --> 17:00.472
I'm amazed what falls off
the best of us

17:00.520 --> 17:02.715
when moving through a room.

17:02.750 --> 17:06.447
- Lessons learned _
from cellular decay: enjoy
the world while we have it

17:06.490 --> 17:11.154
and give a little bit back.
- When possible, I try to leave
an indelible mark wherever I go.

17:11.190 --> 17:14.193
- Hopefully not
with your DNA.

17:18.270 --> 17:20.465
- How long
will you have my suits?

17:20.500 --> 17:23.139
- You might want to think about
supplementing your wardrobe.

17:23.170 --> 17:24.762
- I frequently do.
- You know,

17:24.810 --> 17:27.608
this is just a formality.
Nobody expects

17:27.640 --> 17:29.471
to find anything.

17:29.510 --> 17:32.570
Except for maybe
Will Graham.

17:32.610 --> 17:36.512
- He'll have to be disappointed.
The beauty of what you do,
Ms. Katz,

17:36.550 --> 17:38.279
is in its certainty.

17:38.320 --> 17:41.448
It'll be your evidence
that convicts Will.

17:43.390 --> 17:45.483
- Well, I found enough of it.

17:45.530 --> 17:48.499
No need to infer or intuit
or trust.

17:48.530 --> 17:51.169
- So much simpler
than psychiatry.

17:51.200 --> 17:54.738
Will is doing his best
to understand where he is

17:54.770 --> 17:56.328
and why.

17:56.370 --> 18:00.272
- You were supposed
to protect him.

18:00.310 --> 18:02.528
- From himself?

18:02.580 --> 18:05.105
- Yeah.

18:05.150 --> 18:07.778
I'm not mad at you -
not any more than I'm mad

18:07.820 --> 18:12.439
at myself. We all missed it,
whatever it was - is.

18:12.490 --> 18:14.412
- We all are not suspects.

18:14.460 --> 18:19.329
- You're not a suspect;
you're the new Will Graham.

18:48.220 --> 18:50.188
- Thank you for coming,
Dr. Lecter.

18:50.230 --> 18:52.881
- Jack, what can I do
for you?

18:52.930 --> 18:55.899
- I was hoping you would help me
with a psychological profile.

18:55.930 --> 18:58.319
- (man): We found
another body.

18:58.370 --> 19:00.497
(camera click)

19:00.540 --> 19:02.428
- This way, Doctor.

19:12.950 --> 19:16.340
This is the fourth body
we've recovered so far. There's

19:16.380 --> 19:19.349
at least one more down there.
- How long have they been here?

19:19.390 --> 19:21.483
- Hard to say,
but someone went through a lot

19:21.520 --> 19:23.727
of trouble to make sure
that they were well preserved.

19:23.760 --> 19:25.819
They've been coated
in some kind of resin.

19:25.860 --> 19:28.852
- The big one was
partially sealed,
rotting from the inside out.

19:28.900 --> 19:30.891
The other three look
like they were embalmed.

19:30.930 --> 19:34.468
- (Jack): Whatever he's doing,
he's still figuring out
how to do it.

19:36.570 --> 19:38.902
- Were they injected
with silicone?

19:38.940 --> 19:42.273
- They were injected
with something.
- Silicone?

19:42.310 --> 19:45.370
- A technique for making
resin-coated models out of fish.

19:45.410 --> 19:47.412
Helps the body
retain shape

19:47.450 --> 19:49.475
in death.

19:51.590 --> 19:53.683
He's making human models.

19:53.720 --> 19:55.756
- You make models of things
that you want to keep;

19:55.790 --> 19:57.758
these were tossed
In the men

19:57.790 --> 20:01.590
- Maybe they were
imperfect.

20:03.600 --> 20:06.319
- (Jack): These are
his discards.

20:15.440 --> 20:19.479
- I'm giving you informed
consent to discuss me
as your patIent.

20:19.510 --> 20:21.569
- With whom?

20:21.620 --> 20:23.645
- Jack Crawford.

20:28.460 --> 20:31.725
- Disclosure of patient
information should be limited

20:31.760 --> 20:34.490
to the requirements
of the situation.

20:34.530 --> 20:38.296
What is the situation,
Hannibal?

20:38.330 --> 20:42.562
- Will Graha_m made
accusatIons.

20:42.600 --> 20:44.500
Jack's only
being thorough.

20:44.540 --> 20:48.829
- You're keeping
Agent Crawford close.

20:48.880 --> 20:51.542
- We share
an obseSSIon.

20:55.780 --> 20:58.817
I got to be
Will Graham today.

20:58.850 --> 21:02.513
I consulted
at an FBI crIme scene.

21:04.890 --> 21:07.552
I stood in Will's shoes,

21:07.600 --> 21:10.922
looked through his eyes,
and I saw death...

21:14.040 --> 21:16.668
...how I imagined
he would see it.

21:20.780 --> 21:25.774
- Why would you be inviting
the scrutiny of the FBI?

21:25.810 --> 21:29.644
- I'm being as open and honest
as I know how.

21:32.520 --> 21:35.956
- You maintain an air
of transparency...

21:37.930 --> 21:42.048
...while putting me
in the position to lie for you.

21:42.100 --> 21:43.658
Again.

21:45.630 --> 21:47.769
- You're not just lying
for me.

21:55.010 --> 21:59.379
- How far will this flirtation
with the FBI go?

22:01.850 --> 22:05.980
- It would seem _Jack Crawford is
less SUSplClOUS of me
than you are.

22:06.020 --> 22:09.080
- Jack Crawford doesn't know
what you're capable of.

22:12.760 --> 22:14.853
- Neither do you.

22:27.680 --> 22:30.001
- Come on! Come on!
(dog barking)

22:33.010 --> 22:35.877
VVhoa!
(Shelaughs)

22:35.920 --> 22:39.412
- (Will): And how are the dogs?
- (Alana): Good. Well,

22:39.450 --> 22:42.453
Winston keeps running away,
but the others are adjusting.

22:42.490 --> 22:44.219
- Where does Winston go?

22:48.100 --> 22:50.056
- Home.

22:50.100 --> 22:53.592
- Well, he's not gonna
find me there.
- Not today.

22:53.640 --> 22:56.962
But maybe someday he might.

22:57.000 --> 22:58.809
With the right defense.

22:58.840 --> 23:02.799
- I don't currently have
legal representation.

23:02.840 --> 23:06.742
- You keep firing your lawyers.
- No, they're the FBI's lawyers.

23:06.780 --> 23:10.511
- Then I'll find you a lawyer
who's not affiliated
with the FBI.

23:16.020 --> 23:18.580
- What defense
do you think I have?

23:18.630 --> 23:20.723
- Automatism.

23:20.760 --> 23:23.467
Allows a defendant to argue
they shouldn't be held

23:23.500 --> 23:26.958
criminally liable for their
actions due to unconsciousness.

23:27.000 --> 23:29.969
- Unconsciousness?
- WIll...

23:31.940 --> 23:34.670
...your mind was on fire.

23:34.710 --> 23:37.201
You had no control
of what you were doing,

23:37.240 --> 23:39.208
much less remember doing it.

23:39.250 --> 23:41.639
- What ifI could remember?

23:43.620 --> 23:47.147
What ifI could remember
how this was done to me?

23:49.120 --> 23:52.726
- What if you could remember
how you did it?

23:52.760 --> 23:55.627
- You believe Hannibal.

23:55.660 --> 23:58.993
- I believe the Will Graham
standing in front of me now

23:59.030 --> 24:01.134
is incapable
of that violence.

24:01.170 --> 24:05.504
I believe you lost your mind,
and for periods of

24:05.540 --> 24:07.838
time, you weren't
the Will Graham I know.

24:07.880 --> 24:09.836
- I hear Hannibal's voice

24:09.880 --> 24:12.872
in the well of my mind.

24:12.910 --> 24:15.674
I hear him saying words
that he's never said to me.

24:15.720 --> 24:18.848
It isn't my imagination.
It's... it's something else.

24:25.060 --> 24:28.621
Have you ever helped a patient
recover memories?

24:28.660 --> 24:30.696
(metronome ticking)

24:39.870 --> 24:41.770
- Close your eyes.

24:48.850 --> 24:51.887
(whispering): Feel the happiness
in your limbs.

24:56.690 --> 24:59.955
Imagine yourself in a safe...

24:59.990 --> 25:03.494
and relaxing place.

25:07.970 --> 25:12.009
Safe to relax completely.

25:16.680 --> 25:20.741
No matter how deeply you go...

25:20.780 --> 25:24.546
my voice will go with you.

26:10.030 --> 26:11.861
- This... this isn't working.

26:11.900 --> 26:13.868
(Will panting)

26:13.900 --> 26:16.061
- What did you see?

26:18.170 --> 26:19.899
Will,

26:19.940 --> 26:21.976
what did you see?

26:34.860 --> 26:37.351
- Salted and ash-baked celeriac

26:37.390 --> 26:40.689
with foraged sel fou.

26:40.730 --> 26:42.698
Frederick,
you have tested me.

26:42.730 --> 26:45.119
(claSSIcal pIano mu5Ic)

26:45.170 --> 26:47.388
It's rare that I cook
a meatless meal.

26:47.430 --> 26:50.968
- I lost a kidney; I have to
watch my protein intake.

26:51.010 --> 26:53.774
- You didn't lose it, Frederick;
it was taken from you.

26:53.810 --> 26:56.734
I remain impressed
with your recovery.

26:56.780 --> 26:59.601
- One can grow
to love beets.

27:01.420 --> 27:03.809
Alana Bloom was

27:03.850 --> 27:05.841
visiting with your former
paﬁenttoday.

27:05.890 --> 27:07.755
- Will was never my patient.

27:07.790 --> 27:10.384
- The irony is
that he is my patient,

27:10.420 --> 27:12.650
but he refuses
to speak to me.

27:14.430 --> 27:16.921
Makes me feel
like I'm fumbling with his head

27:16.960 --> 27:19.269
like a freshman
pulling at a panty girdle.

27:19.300 --> 27:23.430
- Will is going to be
a challenge for any
psychiatrist.

27:23.470 --> 27:25.768
- He is so lucid,
so perceptive.

27:25.810 --> 27:28.734
He's trained
in criminal psychology,

27:28.780 --> 27:30.975
and he is a mass murderer.

27:31.010 --> 27:32.773
He's a prize patient.

27:32.810 --> 27:34.209
Or should be.

27:34.250 --> 27:37.413
- How was Dr. Bloom's visit?

27:37.450 --> 27:40.715
- He asked her to hypnotize him
so he could

27:40.760 --> 27:44.059
recov_er_his memories.
ThIs Is deIICIous.

27:46.890 --> 27:48.858
- Was he successful?

27:48.900 --> 27:50.993
- Only in playing
Dr. Bloom.

27:51.030 --> 27:53.863
It's sad to see _
a brI||Iant psychIatrIst

27:53.900 --> 27:56.334
fall for such hoary
old chestnuts.

27:56.370 --> 27:59.134
- She wants to believe him;
I do too.

27:59.170 --> 28:02.105
- You do realize you're his
favorite topic of conversation.

28:02.140 --> 28:05.769
Hannibal, Hannibal, Hannibal.
Not with me, of course,

28:05.810 --> 28:08.074
but with everyone else
who will listen. He tells

28:08.120 --> 28:10.714
everyone that you are
a monster.

28:12.920 --> 28:16.412
- Well, in that case, you are
dining with a psychopathic
murderer, Frederick.

28:44.950 --> 28:47.214
- (man): You have nice skin.

28:54.030 --> 28:57.295
(honking continuously)

29:07.570 --> 29:10.004
(Alarm chirps.)
(Honking stops.)

30:25.190 --> 30:27.112
- Dental and medical records

30:27.150 --> 30:29.880
placed the six - all adults,
both men and women,

30:29.920 --> 30:32.889
different ages,
different ethnicities,
all from different states;

30:32.930 --> 30:36.024
nothing in common except
they all disappeared from
their homes with their vehicles.

30:36.060 --> 30:38.267
- And they all had large amounts
of heroin in their systems.

30:38.300 --> 30:40.268
- Enough to be
the cause of death?

30:40.300 --> 30:42.029
- And then some.

30:42.070 --> 30:45.858
- What's this strange skin
discoloration on these bodies?

30:45.910 --> 30:48.572
- We found traces of BHT,
which is a color preservative.

30:48.610 --> 30:51.170
- He wants them
to look alive.

30:51.210 --> 30:53.201
- Shot them up
with a little China White,

30:53.250 --> 30:55.172
injected them
with preservatives,

30:55.220 --> 30:58.314
then filled the bodies with
silicone so they don't emaciate,

30:58.350 --> 31:00.181
then he seals them

31:00.220 --> 31:03.155
with, like,
a hard resin shell.

31:03.190 --> 31:05.454
- What are
these puncture wounds?

31:05.490 --> 31:07.583
- Those are like eyelets.
Um, something was

31:07.630 --> 31:09.598
threaded through.
They were strung up, mounted,

31:09.630 --> 31:12.190
presented.
- So how's he choosing them?

31:12.230 --> 31:14.960
- We got nothing.
Appears to be random,

31:15.000 --> 31:17.594
but if this is
the discard pile,

31:17.640 --> 31:20.609
I'm curious to know
how many were keepers.

31:20.640 --> 31:22.938
- All right, I want a list
of any missing persons

31:22.980 --> 31:24.948
that disappeared
along with their vehicles

31:24.980 --> 31:27.278
in the neighboring states.
Got it?

31:27.310 --> 31:28.948
- Got it.

31:33.690 --> 31:35.885
(door buzzer)

31:42.200 --> 31:43.553
- It's good to see you.

31:43.600 --> 31:47.058
- Don't know_ how I feel
about seeIng you.

31:47.100 --> 31:48.431
I'll let you know when I do.

31:48.470 --> 31:51.234
- Does Jack know you're here?
- No,

31:51.270 --> 31:55.036
but he shouldn't be surprised.
- I'm surprised.

31:55.080 --> 31:58.948
- I'm... _ _
compartmentaIIZIng.

31:58.980 --> 32:01.676
There are _ _
a lot of people mIssmg.

32:03.680 --> 32:05.079
- Ah.

32:12.260 --> 32:14.694
You have the file with you?
- Yes.

32:18.000 --> 32:19.490
- And pictures?

32:19.530 --> 32:22.090
- Yes.

32:22.140 --> 32:24.199
The first six bodies

32:24.240 --> 32:28.074
were found in the same place -
dumped in a river, caught
in a beaver dam.

32:31.410 --> 32:32.968
- What's he do to 'em?

32:33.010 --> 32:35.069
- He targets them,
follows them home,

32:35.120 --> 32:37.509
abducts them,
and preserves them.

32:37.550 --> 32:40.439
- You want to know how he's
choosmg them, don't you?

32:40.490 --> 32:43.288
- I thought you would
have some ideas.

32:43.320 --> 32:46.153
These are DMV pictures
of people who are

32:46.190 --> 32:49.728
still missing
under similar circumstances

32:49.760 --> 32:51.990
from three
different states.

32:55.540 --> 32:57.565
Tell me what you see.

33:44.550 --> 33:46.586
- It's a color palette.

34:07.270 --> 34:09.431
(exhaHng)

34:33.200 --> 34:35.191
(person choking)

34:50.180 --> 34:52.182
(Will choking)

35:32.630 --> 35:34.655
(choking)

35:40.370 --> 35:42.167
(spitting)

35:42.200 --> 35:44.464
(coughing)

36:33.620 --> 36:36.316
(dog whining)

36:40.690 --> 36:42.920
- Hi, Winston.

36:42.960 --> 36:45.190
Come here, boy.
There you go.

36:48.440 --> 36:50.795
I suppose
you blame me too, huh?

37:01.010 --> 37:02.614
- Hello, Jack.

37:08.460 --> 37:11.429
- You need to take
better care of this dog.

37:11.460 --> 37:14.429
- Mm. I feel horrible.

37:14.460 --> 37:18.464
I got all the dogs chipped,
but at least they're not

37:18.500 --> 37:20.491
running away to anywhere
I can't find 'em.

37:20.530 --> 37:22.395
- He's just looking for Will.

37:22.440 --> 37:25.864
Hmm? Yeah.

37:25.910 --> 37:28.470
- Isn't that why
you're here?

37:30.540 --> 37:31.973
- Listen, uh...

37:33.950 --> 37:36.771
...I understand why you felt
you had to file that report.

37:36.820 --> 37:40.381
You questioned my judgment
when it needed to be questioned.

37:40.420 --> 37:43.059
- Yes, it did.

37:43.090 --> 37:46.878
- And it will help in Will's
defense if it's in the record.

37:49.400 --> 37:51.368
- Declaring Hannibal's guilt is
more important to Will

37:51.400 --> 37:53.391
than establishing
his own defense.

37:53.430 --> 37:55.489
- Hannibal's not guilty.

37:55.540 --> 37:58.338
- Neither is Will.

37:58.370 --> 37:59.906
But he's clinging to the hope

37:59.940 --> 38:03.000
Hannibal did this so he doesn't
have to face what he did.

38:05.110 --> 38:08.375
- Convince me he didn't know
what he was doing.

38:08.420 --> 38:11.309
I would really like
to be convinced, Alana.

38:11.350 --> 38:15.059
- A psychopath wouldn't be
so scared of the truth, Jack.

38:15.090 --> 38:17.615
Will's terrified,
but that's not stopping him

38:17.660 --> 38:19.582
from trying to find it.

38:19.630 --> 38:21.951
- Somebody's gotta find
the truth, eh, Winston?

38:23.930 --> 38:27.491
- If Will doesn't remember
what he did...

38:27.530 --> 38:29.964
he'll never accept
the truth.

38:42.980 --> 38:45.016
- (Jack): Will?

38:47.520 --> 38:49.385
Will?

38:51.730 --> 38:53.948
Hey, Will.

38:58.000 --> 38:59.524
- Hi, Jack.

38:59.570 --> 39:01.765
- Where were you just now?

39:01.800 --> 39:04.439
- Gone fishin'.

39:04.470 --> 39:06.529
What are you doing here?

39:06.570 --> 39:09.630
- I needed to remind myself
of who you once were.

39:09.680 --> 39:11.648
You know, that man

39:11.680 --> 39:14.444
whos_e classroom
I walked Into months ago.

39:14.480 --> 39:16.471
- I remember that man.

39:18.590 --> 39:20.581
Memories are all I have.

39:22.590 --> 39:23.852
Imagine how

39:23.890 --> 39:27.018
nice it is
to stumble on a new one.

39:30.700 --> 39:32.065
I was

39:32.100 --> 39:36.537
almost certain
Hannibal Lecter

39:36.570 --> 39:39.505
did this to me.
And it's a funny thing, doubt.

39:39.540 --> 39:43.931
I had nothing to prove to myself
or... or anyone else

39:43.980 --> 39:47.370
that Hannibal was responsible -
not even a memory.

39:49.150 --> 39:50.708
- You have something now?

39:50.750 --> 39:52.718
You've recovered
a memory?

39:52.750 --> 39:54.479
- Yes.

39:54.520 --> 39:56.750
- That's meaningless.

39:56.790 --> 39:58.678
- Not to me.

40:00.660 --> 40:04.118
He did it so well.

40:04.160 --> 40:07.698
I... there... there wasn't
an orgy of eVIdence.

40:07.730 --> 40:09.994
There was just enough
to convince you.

40:10.040 --> 40:14.932
- We investigated your claims
about Dr. Lecter, Will -
thoroughly.

40:14.980 --> 40:17.904
We went over every fiber
of every stitch of clothing.

40:17.940 --> 40:19.601
We took his DNA.

40:19.650 --> 40:23.609
We took his fingerprints.
We found nothing.

40:23.650 --> 40:25.789
- You let the fox
into the henhouse.

40:25.820 --> 40:29.017
- You stood over Cassie Boyle's
body in that field and you
described yourself to me.

40:29.060 --> 40:31.449
- No, I described
Hannibal Lecter.

40:31.490 --> 40:33.629
- I can't hear this anymore.

40:33.660 --> 40:38.893
- I... I am not the intelligent
psychopath you are looking for.

40:44.940 --> 40:46.635
- Goodbye, Will.

40:46.670 --> 40:49.002
(dejected sigh)

40:50.980 --> 40:53.141
- You may not
believe me now.

40:55.150 --> 40:57.141
You will.

41:46.970 --> 41:50.235
(shuddering)
(grunting with effort)
