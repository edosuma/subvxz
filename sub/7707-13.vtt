[ALF burps]

00:04.405 --> 00:05.904
Stomach number four?

00:05.906 --> 00:10.042
Three. Number four still
hasn't digested that Reebok.

00:11.712 --> 00:13.846
- Hi, everyone.
- 'Hi, dad.'

00:13.848 --> 00:17.383
Gentlemen, start your enzymes.

00:17.385 --> 00:18.851
I'll get dinner.

00:18.853 --> 00:20.486
I'll help.

00:20.488 --> 00:23.589
- I'm sorry I'm late.
- Don't tell me.

00:23.591 --> 00:26.025
That new guy at work
held you up again.

00:26.027 --> 00:29.628
Yeah. Once that Jim
starts talking to us

00:29.630 --> 00:31.196
it's just impossible
to get away.

00:31.198 --> 00:34.500
This time I actually had
my hand on the car door

00:34.502 --> 00:36.668
before he got me.

00:36.670 --> 00:38.237
Who is this guy?

00:38.239 --> 00:40.506
The idiot son of the boss?

00:40.508 --> 00:43.709
No, he's just an idiot.

00:44.912 --> 00:46.912
Well, you better not
be late tomorrow night.

00:46.914 --> 00:48.881
Or have you forgotten
about helping me

00:48.883 --> 00:50.783
put up the satellite dish?

00:50.785 --> 00:53.218
What satellite dish?

00:53.220 --> 00:55.554
Oh. I ordered a satellite dish.

00:55.556 --> 00:57.523
It'll be here tomorrow.

00:57.525 --> 00:59.324
Will you help me put it up?

00:59.326 --> 01:00.859
I'll help you send it back.

01:00.861 --> 01:02.694
Can't, I bought it during their

01:02.696 --> 01:06.632
"Absolutely No Refunds,
What Are You, Deaf?" Sale.

01:06.634 --> 01:09.368
Absolutely no refunds?

01:09.370 --> 01:10.736
What are you, deaf?

02:14.468 --> 02:17.870
(Jim)
But how many canals are
actually being built today?

02:17.872 --> 02:19.671
I really like
your car, Willie.

02:19.673 --> 02:20.706
I don't know why
people are always

02:20.708 --> 02:22.608
bad-mouthing domestic cars.

02:22.610 --> 02:24.276
There are more important
things than good mileage

02:24.278 --> 02:25.611
styling and resale value.

02:27.114 --> 02:28.814
Thank you, Jim.

02:28.816 --> 02:31.216
Please. I keep asking you

02:31.218 --> 02:32.951
call me "Jimbo".

02:34.488 --> 02:36.855
N-no.

02:36.857 --> 02:39.591
Come on. I'm the only Jim
you'll ever meet

02:39.593 --> 02:41.293
who'll let you
call him "Jimbo".

02:41.295 --> 02:42.494
Live a little, Willie.

02:42.496 --> 02:44.029
I am living.

02:44.031 --> 02:46.865
So, uh, you from
California originally?

02:46.867 --> 02:48.700
I was born in Seattle.

02:48.702 --> 02:52.471
I attended school,
graduating in 1974 from NYU.

02:52.473 --> 02:53.872
I worked in record promotions

02:53.874 --> 02:56.108
prior to my current job
at Social Services.

02:56.110 --> 02:58.911
My hobbies are saving whales
and driving my DeLorean.

03:00.548 --> 03:03.916
- That's quite a life.
- No book offers yet. Ha ha!

03:06.020 --> 03:08.287
Speaking of your DeLorean..

03:08.289 --> 03:10.789
Um, when are you gonna
get it out of the shop?

03:10.791 --> 03:12.257
I'm in no hurry.

03:12.259 --> 03:15.294
I'd rather they fix it
right than fast.

03:15.296 --> 03:16.795
Fast is good, too.

03:18.232 --> 03:20.032
Well..

03:20.034 --> 03:21.633
Here we are.

03:21.635 --> 03:23.635
This is my apartment.

03:23.637 --> 03:26.171
It's lovely. Goodnight.

03:26.173 --> 03:27.606
When you said you'd
take me home tonight

03:27.608 --> 03:30.008
I assumed...you meant
your home.

03:30.811 --> 03:33.245
Well, why would you..

03:33.247 --> 03:35.847
I mean, what made
you think that?

03:37.051 --> 03:40.052
I just assumed you invited
me home to dinner.

03:40.054 --> 03:41.486
Oh.

03:41.488 --> 03:43.121
Oh, no, that's okay.

03:43.123 --> 03:46.258
I'm getting pretty good
at making macaroni and cheese.

03:46.260 --> 03:48.193
I'll get better when
they fix my stove.

03:50.631 --> 03:53.465
I remember home cooked meals
with my folks..

03:53.467 --> 03:55.400
...when they were still alive.

03:55.402 --> 03:57.069
Boy..

03:57.071 --> 04:00.272
You just never appreciate stuff
like that until it's gone.

04:01.842 --> 04:03.709
You know, ordinarily

04:03.711 --> 04:07.346
I'd love to invite you, Jim-bo.

04:07.348 --> 04:10.916
- But--
- Oh, no, I'd never impose!

04:10.918 --> 04:13.252
It's against the orphans' creed.

04:20.060 --> 04:22.794
- I don't suppose you--
- Love to.

04:22.796 --> 04:24.863
Can I bring a can or something?

04:27.534 --> 04:29.334
[instrumental music]

04:32.573 --> 04:34.706
- How's it going?
- Lousy.

04:34.708 --> 04:36.441
I'm getting a lot of static

04:36.443 --> 04:39.444
and for once, it's not
coming from Kate. Ha!

04:40.614 --> 04:43.415
Ha ha!

04:43.417 --> 04:45.384
It says here that,
"The satellite dish

04:45.386 --> 04:47.085
"must be in an open area

04:47.087 --> 04:49.488
so nothing blocks its signal."

04:49.490 --> 04:50.989
Then there's only one solution.

04:50.991 --> 04:53.759
I must tear down the garage.

04:55.162 --> 04:56.028
Where's dad?

04:56.030 --> 04:57.429
He called a little while ago.

04:57.431 --> 04:59.998
He's bringing Jim Hutchinson
home for dinner.

05:00.000 --> 05:01.199
What?

05:01.201 --> 05:03.635
Why didn't you tell me
this when he called?

05:03.637 --> 05:05.971
I thought it would give you
less time to bellyache.

05:07.441 --> 05:09.107
Why don't you bring
the portable TV

05:09.109 --> 05:10.909
out to the garage with you?

05:10.911 --> 05:12.477
What's the point?

05:12.479 --> 05:15.347
The dish isn't working,
Willie promised to help me

05:15.349 --> 05:17.783
and now he's bringing
home strays.

05:19.453 --> 05:23.121
You're just lucky we're letting
you keep that satellite dish.

05:23.123 --> 05:25.791
Don't use the words,
"lucky" and "dish"

05:25.793 --> 05:28.160
in the same sentence
unless you mean it.

05:32.566 --> 05:34.633
- ALF?
- What?

05:34.635 --> 05:35.701
The garage?

05:35.703 --> 05:37.736
Objection.

05:37.738 --> 05:39.237
Overruled.

05:41.241 --> 05:43.175
However, it was
Mark Twain's contention

05:43.177 --> 05:44.943
that in heaven
there is no humor

05:44.945 --> 05:46.878
due to the fact that
humor comes from pain.

05:46.880 --> 05:47.979
Since there is
no pain in heaven

05:47.981 --> 05:49.448
then there must be no humor.

05:49.450 --> 05:51.950
Mark Twain's real name
was Samuel Clemens.

05:54.054 --> 05:55.954
Oh, you've stopped.

05:58.992 --> 06:01.226
Hi, everyone. This is Jim.

06:01.228 --> 06:03.995
- Jimbo.
- Jim-bo.

06:03.997 --> 06:05.764
Jimbo, this is my family.

06:05.766 --> 06:07.933
This is Kate and Lynn and Brian.

06:07.935 --> 06:09.334
- Hello.
- Hi.

06:09.336 --> 06:10.569
Hi, Mr. Jimbo.

06:15.242 --> 06:16.274
Uh..

06:18.545 --> 06:22.381
We sometimes loan our cable
hook-up to the neighbors.

06:25.185 --> 06:27.786
Dinner's ready.
Grab a chair.

06:27.788 --> 06:29.788
Thanks.

06:29.790 --> 06:34.159
Look, uh, if I'm imposing
in the least, I'll leave.

06:34.161 --> 06:35.994
I'm used to eating alone.

06:35.996 --> 06:37.929
I'm an orphan.

06:37.931 --> 06:40.031
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

06:40.033 --> 06:42.334
Most people are.

06:42.336 --> 06:44.603
And no, you're not
imposing in the least.

06:45.806 --> 06:48.173
Are you from around here, Jimbo?

06:48.175 --> 06:49.708
I was born in Seattle.

06:49.710 --> 06:53.178
I attended school,
graduating in 1974 from NYU.

06:53.180 --> 06:54.513
'I worked in record promotions'

06:54.515 --> 06:57.115
'prior to my current job
at Social Services.'

06:57.117 --> 06:59.284
'My hobbies are saving whales..'

07:03.724 --> 07:05.424
Hi, ALF.

07:05.426 --> 07:06.591
Yeah.

07:08.495 --> 07:12.230
I.. I wanted to apologize
for not being to help

07:12.232 --> 07:14.099
you setup the satellite dish.

07:14.101 --> 07:18.370
You know, I never really
meant to invite Jimbo over.

07:18.372 --> 07:20.605
You brought home
an elephant for dinner?

07:22.176 --> 07:25.343
I said Jimbo...not Jumbo.

07:26.914 --> 07:28.346
How's the dish working?

07:28.348 --> 07:30.882
Better since I hauled
it up on the roof..

07:30.884 --> 07:32.884
...by myself.

07:32.886 --> 07:36.188
Never mind that I almost
threw out my back.

07:36.190 --> 07:39.524
Stop trying to make
me feel guilty, ALF.

07:39.526 --> 07:41.259
I'm not.

07:41.261 --> 07:43.695
By the way,
sorry about your wheelbarrow.

07:43.697 --> 07:46.264
I landed on it
when I fell off the roof.

07:47.468 --> 07:50.635
You're not going
to make me feel guilty.

07:50.637 --> 07:53.205
I'm not trying to.

07:53.207 --> 07:56.174
But I'm sure the electric shock
I got when I plugged the dish in

07:56.176 --> 08:00.312
only took, what,
80, 90 years off my life?

08:01.482 --> 08:03.381
Okay, I feel guilty.

08:04.685 --> 08:06.618
Something I said?

08:11.325 --> 08:12.891
Another thing
I'll bet you didn't know

08:12.893 --> 08:16.528
Columbia, South America
is completely East of Florida.

08:16.530 --> 08:18.196
And the Atlantic end
of the Panama Canal

08:18.198 --> 08:20.532
is West of the Pacific end.

08:22.803 --> 08:25.036
I had no idea.

08:25.038 --> 08:27.172
- Kate, did you?
- Mm-mm.

08:27.174 --> 08:30.008
- Lynn?
- Mm-mm.

08:30.010 --> 08:32.310
We had no idea.

08:35.249 --> 08:37.115
It's your bedtime, Lynnie.

08:37.117 --> 08:38.450
Oh, thank you.

08:38.452 --> 08:40.552
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

08:40.554 --> 08:44.289
Gosh! Look, Jimbo,
look how late it is.

08:44.291 --> 08:48.560
You're right. There's a great
Senate Filibuster on C-SPAN.

08:48.562 --> 08:51.196
You think we can get the cable
back from your neighbors?

08:52.499 --> 08:54.566
We'll see if
they're still up.

08:55.569 --> 08:58.303
They usually go to bed
at a decent hour.

08:58.305 --> 08:59.604
Thanks.

09:02.943 --> 09:05.043
ALF!

09:05.045 --> 09:07.212
How long have you
been out here?

09:07.214 --> 09:09.948
Long enough to hate
little Orphan Whiney

09:09.950 --> 09:12.384
with every fiber
of my being.

09:13.654 --> 09:16.521
It's not his fault
he's an orphan.

09:16.523 --> 09:19.524
Wanna bet? He probably
bored his parents to death.

09:20.661 --> 09:24.296
Honey, it is time
for him to go home.

09:24.298 --> 09:25.864
I'm trying, Kate.

09:25.866 --> 09:28.266
The man cannot take a hint.

09:28.268 --> 09:31.736
See if he can take
a swift kick in the butt.

09:31.738 --> 09:34.406
Alright, he's taken advantage
of us long enough.

09:34.408 --> 09:36.975
I'm just gonna have
to be firm with him.

09:36.977 --> 09:39.277
Firm? Ooh!

09:39.279 --> 09:40.545
I haven't seen you
this worked up

09:40.547 --> 09:43.214
since the time
you were adamant.

09:47.120 --> 09:49.120
Too rough?

09:51.191 --> 09:53.024
This is interesting.

09:53.026 --> 09:54.292
'Did you know
your satellite dish'

09:54.294 --> 09:56.261
'operates at a frequency
of four gigahertz'

09:56.263 --> 09:57.562
as opposed to
the infrared band

09:57.564 --> 09:59.798
which is considerably
higher on the spectrum.

10:02.002 --> 10:03.868
It's very late.

10:03.870 --> 10:05.470
I know it is.

10:05.472 --> 10:07.172
And I'm sure
you're tired.

10:07.174 --> 10:09.908
Well, as a matter
of fact, I am.

10:09.910 --> 10:12.110
So, you don't have to bother
about driving me home.

10:12.112 --> 10:14.212
Just give me your keys,
I'll sleep in the car.

10:15.816 --> 10:17.515
We couldn't let you
do that.

10:17.517 --> 10:20.018
No, really,
I'll be fine.

10:20.020 --> 10:21.753
It'll be nice and quiet
in your car.

10:21.755 --> 10:23.221
Not like my apartment.

10:23.223 --> 10:25.490
They're building that
new freeway, you know?

10:25.492 --> 10:27.225
But the noise
is usually drowned out

10:27.227 --> 10:29.227
by the all-night
bowling alley.

10:30.297 --> 10:32.464
Well, then, of course..

10:32.466 --> 10:35.233
You can always spend
the night here.

10:35.235 --> 10:37.302
Only if I'm not imposing.

10:39.406 --> 10:41.072
We can put Brian
in with Lynn

10:41.074 --> 10:43.375
and, uh, you can
have his room.

10:43.377 --> 10:46.311
You folks have been
so nice to me.

10:46.313 --> 10:48.046
Can I level with you?

10:48.048 --> 10:49.748
I guess.

10:51.818 --> 10:54.319
My name is not really
Jim, it's Steve.

10:55.288 --> 10:57.355
Goodnight, Steve.

10:57.357 --> 11:00.558
Please, call me
Steve-O-Rino.

11:00.560 --> 11:02.627
Goodnight,
Steve-O-Rino.

11:02.629 --> 11:04.162
You know

11:04.164 --> 11:06.197
I am glad you didn't ask me

11:06.199 --> 11:08.066
why I don't go
by my real name

11:08.068 --> 11:09.901
because I can't tell you.

11:11.104 --> 11:12.737
I wish I could

11:12.739 --> 11:15.440
because it's a really
great story, but..

11:15.442 --> 11:17.108
They told me
I couldn't.

11:17.110 --> 11:18.677
Well, I shouldn't.

11:18.679 --> 11:20.712
But I could.

11:20.714 --> 11:23.081
Since you handled
the name thing so well.

11:23.083 --> 11:24.883
Okay, I'll tell you.

11:27.754 --> 11:29.120
How long?

11:29.122 --> 11:30.722
Not long.

11:31.792 --> 11:32.957
Have you ever heard

11:32.959 --> 11:35.427
of the Federal Witness
Protection Program?

11:35.429 --> 11:37.362
Yes, they give
new identities

11:37.364 --> 11:39.964
to people who have
testified in trials.

11:39.966 --> 11:41.766
You're in that program?

11:41.768 --> 11:44.469
I can't really say.

11:44.471 --> 11:45.770
Yes.

11:45.772 --> 11:47.772
I testified against
some counterfeiters.

11:47.774 --> 11:50.442
Nailed them good. They've been
looking for me ever since.

11:50.444 --> 11:52.577
Oh, where's the john?

11:53.780 --> 11:55.847
Right this way, Jim.

11:55.849 --> 11:59.217
Uh, Steve...O-Rino.

12:02.656 --> 12:06.825
You're not seriously gonna let
Scarface stay here, are you?

12:06.827 --> 12:10.528
He's not a criminal.
He's a witness.

12:10.530 --> 12:13.231
What if the mob
finds him here?

12:13.233 --> 12:15.600
They'll blow us up
in our sedan!

12:16.703 --> 12:19.604
There is no mob
in this neighborhood.

12:19.606 --> 12:21.806
And of course they
couldn't just drive

12:21.808 --> 12:24.876
into this neighborhood
in their sedans.

12:26.046 --> 12:27.746
Goodnight, ALF.

12:27.748 --> 12:29.614
Wait, you can't
go to bed, Willie.

12:29.616 --> 12:31.416
You have to stay awake
and protect us

12:31.418 --> 12:34.552
from a sedan-related death.

12:36.223 --> 12:37.956
If you're that concerned

12:37.958 --> 12:41.693
why don't you stay up?

12:41.695 --> 12:45.663
Immediately I realize
the folly of that statement.

12:47.033 --> 12:48.666
Go to the garage.

12:48.668 --> 12:51.870
And wake up with
Mr. Ed's head in my bed?

12:56.209 --> 12:58.009
I think not.

13:08.255 --> 13:11.055
This is the city.

13:11.057 --> 13:13.958
Los Angeles, California.

13:13.960 --> 13:17.695
I was working the night watch
out of the backyard.

13:17.697 --> 13:19.330
Today is Friday.

13:19.332 --> 13:21.699
My name is ALF.

13:21.701 --> 13:23.968
I carry a bat.

13:23.970 --> 13:25.036
[leaves rustling]

13:26.273 --> 13:29.941
Whoa, someone's lurking
in the bushes.

13:31.745 --> 13:34.145
[meowing]

13:34.147 --> 13:36.414
Cat burglar.

13:36.416 --> 13:37.816
[man screaming]

13:38.919 --> 13:41.719
Wha.. Oh, an intruder!

13:44.891 --> 13:46.257
[screaming]

13:46.259 --> 13:49.527
Oh! Oh! Ow! ALF, no!

13:49.529 --> 13:51.429
ALF, what are you doing?

13:51.431 --> 13:54.199
Protecting the family
from murderers!

13:54.201 --> 13:58.336
You were the last person I
would have suspected, Willie.

13:58.338 --> 14:01.873
[groans]
I'm not a murderer..

14:01.875 --> 14:03.541
...yet!

14:03.543 --> 14:05.276
Yeah, maybe
I should come back

14:05.278 --> 14:07.045
when you're
in a better mood.

14:08.315 --> 14:10.615
Get me down from here!

14:10.617 --> 14:13.618
(Trevor)
'Hey, Tanner, is that you?'

14:17.090 --> 14:19.724
Trevor, what I'm doing..

14:20.493 --> 14:22.060
...is very complicated

14:22.062 --> 14:24.495
and it requires
all my concentration.

14:24.497 --> 14:27.131
So if you'd please
care to come back later

14:27.133 --> 14:29.834
I'd be happy to answer
any questions at that time.

14:29.836 --> 14:31.936
Thank you,
and goodnight.

14:31.938 --> 14:33.071
Goodnight.

14:36.309 --> 14:39.510
Get me down!

14:39.512 --> 14:41.379
Okay, okay.

14:45.919 --> 14:47.986
[Willie slamming]

14:47.988 --> 14:50.488
[groaning]

14:53.293 --> 14:56.194
ALF, would you come
over here for a minute?

14:56.196 --> 14:57.595
Uh-uh.

14:57.597 --> 14:59.297
Would you just..
Would you mind just coming..

14:59.299 --> 15:01.466
Coming here just within
my reach, please?

15:01.468 --> 15:03.668
You appear to be
at the end of my rope.

15:06.539 --> 15:10.141
I thought I told you
to go to bed!

15:10.143 --> 15:13.444
Willie, one of us has to insure
domestic tranquility.

15:13.446 --> 15:16.547
And provide for
the common defense.

15:16.549 --> 15:20.151
Besides, you didn't
say, "Simon says".

15:23.223 --> 15:24.589
[snoring]

15:24.591 --> 15:25.890
[car door closes]

15:28.061 --> 15:29.594
What.. Oh.

15:29.596 --> 15:31.896
A stranger approacheth.

15:34.134 --> 15:35.700
Steady, ALF.

15:35.702 --> 15:37.402
Steady.

15:37.404 --> 15:39.570
Don't soil yourself.

15:58.425 --> 15:59.657
[screams]

16:01.161 --> 16:03.962
Behold. Excalibur.

16:05.165 --> 16:07.065
ALF? What was that?

16:07.067 --> 16:11.102
Willie, you're just in time.
I caught a murderer.

16:11.104 --> 16:12.136
[Willie gasps]

16:15.275 --> 16:17.208
Don't mention it.

16:17.210 --> 16:19.210
He's out cold.

16:19.212 --> 16:21.913
My guess would be that he hit
his head on your sewer pipe.

16:23.116 --> 16:24.916
What's going on, ALF?

16:25.952 --> 16:27.819
Hero ALF.

16:29.155 --> 16:30.888
Why is dad going
through the pockets

16:30.890 --> 16:33.658
of man in a hole
in our backyard at night?

16:33.660 --> 16:35.893
Because we have an alien.

16:35.895 --> 16:37.161
Oh, right.

16:38.164 --> 16:39.630
What are you looking for?

16:39.632 --> 16:41.265
His wallet.

16:41.267 --> 16:44.736
Okay, but we split 50/50.

16:46.873 --> 16:49.674
I am looking
for identification!

16:50.577 --> 16:52.443
You're wasting your time.

16:52.445 --> 16:55.780
No criminal's gonna
carry ID on him.

16:57.150 --> 16:59.617
Unless he's an FBI agent.

17:00.820 --> 17:02.220
ALF!

17:02.222 --> 17:03.621
[gasps]

17:04.657 --> 17:07.859
I disavow any knowledge
of my actions.

17:07.861 --> 17:09.193
Bye!

17:12.298 --> 17:14.032
Dad, do you think
he's okay?

17:14.034 --> 17:17.568
Well, other than that
unsettling grin on his face

17:17.570 --> 17:19.570
he seems to be fine.

17:21.141 --> 17:22.573
I should tell Jimbo.

17:22.575 --> 17:24.175
Come on, Lynnie.

17:28.114 --> 17:29.614
You have to help me!

17:29.616 --> 17:33.084
Don't let this G-man
take me away!

17:33.086 --> 17:35.720
What do you suggest?

17:35.722 --> 17:39.624
Well, I can't take the rap
and you shouldn't have to.

17:40.460 --> 17:42.493
How about Kate?

17:42.495 --> 17:44.662
[sighs]
Oh, ALF.

17:45.532 --> 17:48.232
Just thinking out loud.

17:48.234 --> 17:50.034
How about Kate's mother?

17:51.404 --> 17:53.337
Forget it.
I'm calling a doctor.

17:53.339 --> 17:55.606
[car door opens]
What's that?

17:55.608 --> 17:57.141
[car door closes]

17:57.143 --> 18:00.144
It's, uh...it's a sedan.

18:01.548 --> 18:04.082
It's the mob!

18:04.084 --> 18:05.249
[knock on door]

18:05.251 --> 18:06.884
May I help you?

18:06.886 --> 18:09.787
(male #1)
'FBI may we come in?'

18:09.789 --> 18:11.956
Willie, don't be a hero!

18:11.958 --> 18:14.859
Don't be a fool
with your life!

18:17.063 --> 18:19.063
Could I see some
identification, please?

18:19.065 --> 18:20.731
Yes, sir.

18:22.669 --> 18:24.235
They've got their ID.

18:24.237 --> 18:25.770
Oh.

18:25.772 --> 18:29.073
Well, I can't let you go to jail
for something I did..

18:29.075 --> 18:30.341
...again.

18:31.778 --> 18:33.978
Which way is South America?

18:33.980 --> 18:35.246
[knock on door]

18:35.248 --> 18:36.647
<i> Adios.</i>

18:39.486 --> 18:41.119
We're looking
for Jim Hutchinson.

18:41.121 --> 18:41.986
Is he here?

18:41.988 --> 18:44.455
Yeah, he'll be out
in a second.

18:44.457 --> 18:45.756
Who's this?

18:45.758 --> 18:48.893
Oh, he's-he's one
of your men.

18:49.929 --> 18:52.797
Willie? What's-what's going on?

18:52.799 --> 18:55.133
Well, there's more FBI now.

18:56.236 --> 18:57.869
Oh. Nice to meet you.

18:57.871 --> 19:00.671
Please don't take
my husband away.

19:00.673 --> 19:04.675
Honey, iksnay
on the A-L-Jay.

19:05.512 --> 19:07.211
This ID's a fake.

19:09.048 --> 19:10.448
Hi, guys!

19:10.450 --> 19:13.417
Hi, Jim. Jimbo.

19:13.419 --> 19:15.620
Can we talk
privately?

19:15.622 --> 19:18.623
Hey, it's okay,
they know all about me.

19:18.625 --> 19:20.925
You told some more people?

19:20.927 --> 19:23.561
Why don't you just buy
airtime on the Super Bowl?

19:23.563 --> 19:25.263
[chuckles]

19:25.265 --> 19:26.864
He's the funny one.

19:26.866 --> 19:29.033
We just found out
the Cleveland syndicate's

19:29.035 --> 19:30.134
lookin' for you.

19:30.136 --> 19:32.570
This must be
the guy they sent.

19:32.572 --> 19:33.971
They must have made up
this fake ID

19:33.973 --> 19:35.806
in order to trick Jim..

19:35.808 --> 19:38.176
Jimbo into going
with him.

19:39.946 --> 19:42.280
Shouldn't you be arresting him
about now or something?

19:42.282 --> 19:44.348
Yes, ma'am,
under the circumstances

19:44.350 --> 19:46.717
I think it's best
we take both of them.

19:46.719 --> 19:48.753
Fine.

19:48.755 --> 19:52.323
Not that we haven't enjoyed
having Jimbo stay over.

19:52.325 --> 19:53.724
Thanks.

19:53.726 --> 19:55.493
For everything.

19:55.495 --> 19:56.827
You're the first
person I ever knew

19:56.829 --> 19:58.829
who overlooked
my many faults

19:58.831 --> 20:01.365
and accepted me
for what I am.

20:01.367 --> 20:03.067
I'm gonna miss you, Willie.

20:04.304 --> 20:07.338
But they say friendship
is like an iceberg.

20:07.340 --> 20:09.674
You can't tell by what's
above the surface

20:09.676 --> 20:11.375
just how deep it goes.

20:12.645 --> 20:14.412
Did you know the Titanic's hull

20:14.414 --> 20:17.682
was separated into
16 watertight compartments?

20:17.684 --> 20:19.684
Write him a letter.

20:31.397 --> 20:32.430
ALF?

20:32.432 --> 20:35.166
ALF? Where are you?

20:35.168 --> 20:36.734
Maybe he's
in the garage.

20:36.736 --> 20:38.903
(ALF)
'Ah, oh, ow!'

20:41.107 --> 20:43.641
Oh, ah.

20:43.643 --> 20:45.409
Stupid pipe!

20:46.446 --> 20:48.379
ALF, guess what?

20:48.381 --> 20:52.049
For once your overreacting
actually paid off.

20:52.051 --> 20:55.453
That guy you caught
really was a crook!

20:55.455 --> 20:58.689
As it turns out,
you are a hero!

20:58.691 --> 21:00.391
Well, that's nice.

21:00.393 --> 21:02.226
Really great.

21:02.228 --> 21:03.694
Just one question.

21:03.696 --> 21:05.696
Yeah?

21:05.698 --> 21:07.965
Who are you people?

21:15.575 --> 21:17.742
For meritorious service

21:17.744 --> 21:20.411
above and beyond
the call of duty

21:20.413 --> 21:24.081
we hereby present to you
the Tanner Medal of Honor.

21:24.083 --> 21:25.816
(Kate)
'Hear, hear!'

21:25.818 --> 21:28.019
Yay, ALF!

21:28.021 --> 21:30.321
My hero.

21:30.323 --> 21:31.522
Shucks, folks.

21:31.524 --> 21:34.392
I'm speechless...almost.

21:35.862 --> 21:39.063
"One score and 12 years ago

21:39.065 --> 21:41.999
"My parents brought
forth a new hero

21:42.001 --> 21:44.435
conceived in a De Soto,
and dedicated--"

21:44.437 --> 21:47.938
ALF. ALF, wrap it up
or we take the medal back.

21:49.375 --> 21:50.808
"As God as my witness

21:50.810 --> 21:53.444
I'll never be hungry again."
Thank you.

21:56.316 --> 22:01.419
And now, Kate, how about
making me a hero sandwich?

22:01.421 --> 22:03.487
[laughing]

22:03.489 --> 22:05.056
[knock on door]

22:10.530 --> 22:13.331
Does this belong to you?

22:13.333 --> 22:15.166
I believe so, yes.

22:15.168 --> 22:17.968
You got something I could
cut Raquel down with?

22:19.839 --> 22:21.505
I think there's something
in the garage.

22:21.507 --> 22:23.207
I'll help you.

22:23.209 --> 22:25.309
If you don't want people taking
avocados from your tree

22:25.311 --> 22:27.011
just say so.

22:36.522 --> 22:38.356
Last trap, I promise.

22:43.629 --> 22:46.530
[theme music]

23:07.553 --> 23:09.353
[music continues]

23:10.390 --> 23:12.890
[laughing]
