NARRATOR:
Once upon a time, an evil queen

00:04.547 --> 00:09.132
banished every storybook character
you’ve ever known to our world.

00:09.218 --> 00:13.211
Who knows the truth
and who can break the spell?

00:13.347 --> 00:14.507
You don't play with the curse.

00:15.725 --> 00:18.182
Emma, this is a mistake.
I didn't kill Kathryn!

00:18.352 --> 00:19.808
REGINA: She is a woman
who’s had her heart broken.

00:19.896 --> 00:22.228
That can make you do
unspeakable things.

00:22.315 --> 00:23.304
Ever seen this before?

00:23.399 --> 00:24.764
It's myjewelry box.

00:24.859 --> 00:25.814
That's what we found the heart in.

00:25.902 --> 00:27.733
The evidence is piling up by the hour.

00:27.820 --> 00:28.935
MARY: Okay, what are you saying?

00:29.030 --> 00:31.442
EMMA: You should think
about hiring a lawyer.

00:51.594 --> 00:52.925
(PANTING)

01:17.119 --> 01:19.531
Henry? What are you doing here?

01:19.622 --> 01:21.408
I came to congratulate you.

01:21.499 --> 01:22.705
For what?

01:22.792 --> 01:24.453
Your genius plan.

01:25.044 --> 01:26.659
And what plan is that, Henry?

01:30.549 --> 01:31.629
Right.

01:33.928 --> 01:36.169
Sorry. I thought Mr. Gold was in on it,

01:36.264 --> 01:38.630
now that he's Ms. Blanchard's lawyer.

01:38.724 --> 01:39.713
In on what?

01:40.810 --> 01:42.766
-The escape plan.
-The what?

01:42.853 --> 01:44.354
GOLD: Sheriff, could you join me,
please?

01:50.152 --> 01:51.437
She's gone.

01:51.946 --> 01:53.231
Henry, what did you do?

01:53.322 --> 01:55.734
Nothing.
She was gone when I got here.

01:55.825 --> 01:57.690
Her arraignment's tomorrow.
If she's not there...

01:57.785 --> 01:59.070
She's a fugitive.

01:59.161 --> 02:01.777
Doesn't matter if she's convicted
for Kathryn or not, she's screwed.

02:02.290 --> 02:04.702
l have to go find her
before someone notices she's missing.

02:04.792 --> 02:06.874
-You mean Regina?
-The arraignment's at 8:00 am.

02:06.961 --> 02:09.577
I'm sure she'll be here bright
and early to celebrate her victory.

02:09.672 --> 02:11.287
Well, you have until 8:00 am, then.

02:11.382 --> 02:12.963
What about me? How can I help?

02:13.050 --> 02:14.301
Go home.

02:15.845 --> 02:17.585
Emma, if she leaves Storybrooke...

02:17.680 --> 02:18.635
Not now, Henry. Come on.

02:18.723 --> 02:20.133
Ms. Swan, I know time
is of the essence,

02:20.224 --> 02:23.933
but if Ms. Blanchard doesn't return,
her future is in jeopardy.

02:24.020 --> 02:26.227
And if you're caught helping her,
so is yours.

02:26.314 --> 02:29.021
I don't care. I'd rather lose myjob
than my friend.

02:59.055 --> 03:00.420
(TIRES SCREECH)

03:04.018 --> 03:05.758
-l'm so sorry! Are you okay?
-(COUGHS)

03:05.853 --> 03:07.764
-I didn't see you.
-I think so. (CHUCKLES)

03:07.855 --> 03:08.970
Are you sure?

03:09.065 --> 03:10.726
I'm fine.

03:10.816 --> 03:13.398
I'm not used to sharing the road
with cars so late.

03:13.486 --> 03:15.147
You're the Sheriff, aren't you?

03:15.237 --> 03:16.317
Yeah.

03:16.405 --> 03:17.815
What brings you out here
in the middle of the night?

03:18.574 --> 03:22.533
Nothing to worry about.
I'm just looking for a lost dog.

03:23.245 --> 03:24.200
I hope you find it.

03:24.288 --> 03:25.277
Thank you.

03:26.832 --> 03:28.413
You are hurt.

03:29.210 --> 03:31.872
No, ljust twisted my ankle, I think.
(CHUCKLES)

03:31.962 --> 03:34.044
I live just a mile down the road.
I'll make it okay.

03:34.131 --> 03:36.918
No, let me drive you. I insist.

03:37.009 --> 03:38.294

04:08.874 --> 04:10.205
(CHUCKLES)

04:12.294 --> 04:13.420
You certainly did.

04:14.630 --> 04:16.916
You must be part bloodhound,
my dear Grace.

04:17.174 --> 04:20.007
(GlGGLES) Now it's my turn to hide
and you seek.

04:20.094 --> 04:22.176
(SIGHS) I'm afraid playtime is over.

04:22.972 --> 04:26.556
Though you can still use that nose
of yours, to hunt mushrooms.

04:26.642 --> 04:28.678
Enough to sell at market tomorrow.
You think you can do that?

04:31.313 --> 04:32.769
Ready or not, here we come.

Wait.

04:41.073 --> 04:42.313
Which carriage is that?

04:42.408 --> 04:43.898
The Queen's.

04:47.204 --> 04:48.364
Of course not.

04:49.665 --> 04:51.576
Now, listen carefully, okay?

04:51.667 --> 04:55.410
I want you to stay hidden
in the woods. Like our game.

04:55.504 --> 04:58.291
I'm gonna find out
what she's doing here.

05:16.358 --> 05:19.270
I'd like to say you're looking well,
Jefferson, but I'd be lying.

05:20.613 --> 05:21.898
Poverty doesn't suit you.

05:22.156 --> 05:23.487
What are you doing here, Regina?

05:23.699 --> 05:25.064
l have a job for you.

05:25.367 --> 05:26.527
I don't do that anymore.

05:26.660 --> 05:29.948
Yes, I heard you hung up your hat.
Why?

05:30.039 --> 05:32.246
Is it because
of your sweet daughter, Grace?

05:32.333 --> 05:35.291
Because of my work,
she lost her mother.

05:35.503 --> 05:37.243
I don't want her to lose her father, too.

05:37.338 --> 05:39.499
So now you're foraging for fungus?

05:40.382 --> 05:43.840
What kind of future does your
daughter have here with you?

05:46.013 --> 05:48.720
Do this one last favor for me

05:49.225 --> 05:51.682
and you can give her
the life she deserves.

05:56.357 --> 05:57.893
That's why I'm staying.

05:58.984 --> 06:01.066
You don't abandon family.

06:01.570 --> 06:05.108
That's what she deserves.

06:05.241 --> 06:06.697
Now, please leave.

06:07.243 --> 06:10.360
All I need is your special skills
to get me somewhere.

06:11.372 --> 06:13.158
Somewhere you've been before.

06:13.249 --> 06:15.581
Do it and I can change your life.

06:20.673 --> 06:22.755
What business
could you possibly have there?

06:22.841 --> 06:25.628
Something of mine was taken
and found its way over there.

06:25.719 --> 06:27.459
I want it back.

06:27.555 --> 06:29.091
Then find someone else to get it.

06:32.017 --> 06:36.056
| see. Hard living
has strengthened your resolve.

06:36.397 --> 06:39.639
Well, I'm sorry I couldn't
convince you. But I understand.

There's nothing more important
than family.

I asked you why
and you said you trusted me.
