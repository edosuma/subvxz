the purse, Earl.

29:03.324 --> 29:06.828
Well, I-I took her
to work yesterday.

29:06.828 --> 29:08.830
She must have left it
in there then.

29:08.830 --> 29:10.915
Earl, a woman going off

29:10.915 --> 29:14.169

I've been with women,
falling-down drunks
that'd forget to eat,

forget their purse.

29:19.132 --> 29:21.134
You know when a woman
forgets her purse, huh?

29:21.134 --> 29:24.179

All I wanted was a wife
and I end up with her.

29:38.193 --> 29:42.405
Just in it for what she
could get. I think she was
a prostitute in Russia.

29:42.405 --> 29:44.949
Who knows what
went on over there.

29:44.949 --> 29:47.994
But she had them big blue eyes
and I trusted her.

29:47.994 --> 29:53.374
But she--she just used me
to get into this country.
She played me for a sucker.

29:53.374 --> 29:55.710
All the money I spent
getting her over here.

29:55.710 --> 29:58.671
Then she tries to
soak me in a divorce.

29:58.671 --> 30:02.258
Twenty years in the military.
I was a master sergeant.
I-I got a nice pension.

30:02.258 --> 30:05.178
And then, in six years,
I have my own carpet
cleaning business.

30:05.178 --> 30:07.764
I made something out of myself.
That apartment I live in,
I own that thing.

30:07.764 --> 30:11.351
But that bitch,
she wanted it all.
And she'd have got it too.

30:11.351 --> 30:14.687
Anything for the wife,
no matter what kind of
lying cheat she is.

are in this state.

It's probably too late now
to find out his exact identity,
but that's up to you fellas.

30:23.238 --> 30:25.240
But maybe she was
cheating on him.

30:25.240 --> 30:27.784

and he was just paying her back.

-Uh-uh. I-I seen him.

Last night for the first time.
She called after work...

30:33.832 --> 30:36.918
-and said she was going to
the movies by herself.
-You go looking for her?

30:36.918 --> 30:40.463
Well, I asked her what movie she
was going to and I was waiting
when that movie left out...

30:40.463 --> 30:43.758
to catch her lying on,
you know, being alone.

30:43.758 --> 30:46.803
The man you're looking for,
he's, uh--

30:46.803 --> 30:50.348
he's a big young guy
about 6'2", brown hair.

30:50.348 --> 30:52.976
I guess she thought
he was nice and handsome.

30:52.976 --> 30:55.562
-But I seen 'em walking
away together.
-Did you follow 'em?

30:55.562 --> 30:59.357
-Yeah, that's
who you want to get.
-You're full of crap, Dawkins!

30:59.357 --> 31:02.277
You're the guy had the purse.
You're who killed her.

31:02.277 --> 31:04.988
Earl, did maybe
you follow 'em?

31:04.988 --> 31:08.741
Maybe after the boyfriend
dropped her off near
where you and Marina live,

31:08.741 --> 31:11.786
you pull over and let her
know that you caught her.

31:11.786 --> 31:16.457
Maybe you pull Marina
into the car, let her know
how upset she made you.

31:16.457 --> 31:18.710
Maybe she started
beatin' on you.

31:18.710 --> 31:22.922
Course of fending her off,
things, uh, just got
out of control there.

31:24.591 --> 31:26.593

31:27.886 --> 31:31.306
I got her in the car...

31:31.306 --> 31:33.933
and I started talking
to her about, you know,
her seeing that guy,

31:33.933 --> 31:36.352
and, you know, we start
fighting about the divorce.

31:36.352 --> 31:38.605

that guy that she was seeing,

31:38.605 --> 31:42.191

the door open and--

And then when I see
what I had done, I was
scared out of my mind.

32:12.639 --> 32:16.225
I had to get out of it.
So I put her in the alley.

32:16.225 --> 32:19.604
I remembered on the news
about those girls who were
murdered and raped,

-That type stuff's
uncalled for.

36:56.005 --> 36:59.717
Well, it's not as though he was
revealing a guilty secret, Greg.

36:59.717 --> 37:02.929
That jerk didn't know you were
gay, Abby. He-He was using
like a blanket epithet.

37:02.929 --> 37:07.016
Well, I agree. I mean, what he
said and what I am have nothing
to do with each other.

37:07.016 --> 37:09.727
But I want you to know
when something like that
gets said,

37:09.727 --> 37:13.481
being my friend doesn't mean
you have to be especially
protective.

37:13.481 --> 37:17.652
-Understood. Point taken.
-Not that I'm not appreciative.

37:22.156 --> 37:24.825
Well, uh, here we are
approaching dessert...

37:24.825 --> 37:28.746
and the occasion's, uh,
special nature has yet
to be revealed.

37:28.746 --> 37:31.207
I shouldn't have even put it
that way the other day.

37:31.207 --> 37:36.629
Uh, not that a pleasant meal
with good company isn't
special occasion enough.

37:36.629 --> 37:40.049
I was interested to know
if you might like to meet Kathy.

37:41.634 --> 37:45.680
I assume Kathy's your,
uh, si-significant other.

37:45.680 --> 37:48.266
-My lover, that's right.
-That's what I assumed.

37:48.266 --> 37:54.105
Uh, uh, well,
I-I'd certainly, uh, have
no reason not to meet her,

37:54.105 --> 37:57.233
if the circumstance,
uh, arose.

37:57.233 --> 38:00.736
I was hoping that
we could have you for dinner
some night at our apartment.

38:00.736 --> 38:03.906
Really?
What course would I be?

38:06.367 --> 38:09.578
Well, no, I-I-I'd certainly
have no reason not to.

38:11.122 --> 38:14.041
-I guess I've made you
pretty uncomfortable.
-No. Not at all.

38:14.041 --> 38:17.670
Greg, if-if you'd just as soon
not meet Kathy, I'd understand.

38:17.670 --> 38:20.006
I didn't mean
to give offense.

38:20.006 --> 38:22.717
You-You just
took me unawares.

38:22.717 --> 38:27.138
Well, this is all pretty much
new territory for you.

38:27.138 --> 38:29.140
Past workplace contacts,

38:29.140 --> 38:33.269
y-you're the first
decisively gay woman
I've had much to do with.

38:33.269 --> 38:36.814
And the truth is,

38:36.814 --> 38:39.900
each hurdle we clear
in our friendship,

38:39.900 --> 38:42.737
I find I'm delighted
I leaped.

38:42.737 --> 38:46.907
Well, something unfamiliar
doesn't have to be bad.

38:46.907 --> 38:51.454
-You raise an interesting point.
-Well, I-I was just remembering
the first time I saw you.

38:51.454 --> 38:54.540
You were looking at that
StairMaster like it
was a T. Rex.

38:54.540 --> 38:58.961
-Exactly. Exactly. And look how
wonderfully that turned out.
-Mm-hmm.

38:58.961 --> 39:03.132
The lesson I'm sensing,
Abby, is I can't run
from new experiences.

39:03.132 --> 39:06.677
Suddenly being willing to use
force on the job, for example.

39:06.677 --> 39:10.181
That can be good or wrong
depending on context.

39:10.181 --> 39:12.600
I can't reject the thing
out of hand.

39:15.269 --> 39:18.481
I'd be delighted to meet Kathy,
have a three-way dinner.

39:18.481 --> 39:21.192
-That's great.
-Why not, right?

39:21.192 --> 39:23.694
-That's right.
-What could possibly
happen to me?

39:23.694 --> 39:26.322
I'm really glad, Greg.

39:26.322 --> 39:30.659
And then, um, getting to
know your friend, Kathy,

39:30.659 --> 39:34.455
that in itself
would be the special
occasion you spoke of.

39:34.455 --> 39:38.459
Well, let's just take it
one step at a time.

39:38.459 --> 39:41.003
So, who's for dessert? Hmm?

39:45.132 --> 39:47.927
♪♪

40:07.696 --> 40:13.119
(sighs)
Any progress? Feel you're
about to dump out?

40:16.122 --> 40:18.707
You in the bed,
you speak English?

40:18.707 --> 40:20.376
Yes.

40:23.170 --> 40:28.300
Dumped six smack condoms
for that last cop, huh?
Nice job.

40:28.300 --> 40:30.845
Those were the last six
I had in me.

40:30.845 --> 40:35.516
Course, naturally,
they want me to verify that,
examine your subsequent stool.

40:35.516 --> 40:38.102
I understand.

40:38.102 --> 40:41.355
(mumbling in
foreign language)

40:41.355 --> 40:43.357
How about you tell
your partner here,

40:43.357 --> 40:47.111
no progress
the next few minutes,
I'll dial up his I.V.

40:47.111 --> 40:49.613
He'll have enough laxative
dripping into him,

40:49.613 --> 40:53.742
he'll wind up impersonating
one of your great nation's
oil derricks.

40:53.742 --> 40:56.745
He's Hausa. I don't speak
enough Hausa to say that.

40:56.745 --> 40:59.707
-Says here you're
both Nigerians.
-He's Hausa.

40:59.707 --> 41:04.462
-I'm a Yoruba man.
-Oh, you're "Yorba."

41:04.462 --> 41:07.506
(mumbling)

41:07.506 --> 41:12.094
Huh? Oh, what, you and me,
we're gonna talk
gibberish now? Huh?

41:12.094 --> 41:17.516
-Yeah, wango-bango,
hot tamale.
-(speaking foreign language)

41:17.516 --> 41:20.144
He's trying to speak Yoruba,
my language.

41:20.144 --> 41:22.813
Yeah, well, the two of you,
you have a nice chat.

41:22.813 --> 41:27.943
(speaking Yoruba)

41:27.943 --> 41:30.279
-Says he's political.
-Yeah?

41:30.279 --> 41:34.533
-National Heroin Party.
-(speaking Yoruba)

41:36.118 --> 41:40.456
Says he's political.
This was his chance
to come to America.

41:41.749 --> 41:43.375
Same story for you too?

41:43.375 --> 41:45.461
I'm afraid I came for love.

41:45.461 --> 41:49.507
My girlfriend was a student.
I had no money to follow.

41:49.507 --> 41:54.512
-So you swallowed some balloons.
-They are all in the streets
of Lagos.

41:54.512 --> 41:59.391
They offer you a ticket
if you bring some condoms--
heroin, cocaine.

41:59.391 --> 42:01.519
This is a great country.

42:01.519 --> 42:05.689
I would have been proud
being here, worked hard,
made no trouble.

42:05.689 --> 42:07.691
(gasping)

42:07.691 --> 42:11.070
(speaking foreign language)

42:12.988 --> 42:16.534
-What's his problem?
-He's back in Hausa.

42:19.203 --> 42:21.622
-(panting)
-What's the matter with you?

42:21.622 --> 42:23.874
Oh, I think his drugs
have broken inside him.

42:27.962 --> 42:31.090
-Oh, brother.
-I hope he has no cocaine,

42:31.090 --> 42:34.218
-'cause if it's cocaine,
he's going to die.
-Shut up.

42:34.218 --> 42:38.472
I-I beeped the doctor.
He's gonna be here
in 90 seconds.

42:38.472 --> 42:40.891
Cocaine in some of his condoms.
He's going to die.

42:40.891 --> 42:44.770
All right, you just
take it easy. Tell him
what I said about the doctor.

42:44.770 --> 42:47.898
-He's dying!
-I watched plenty of people
die, pal, all right?

42:47.898 --> 42:50.734
I don't need you
telling me he's dying!

43:07.001 --> 43:09.628
