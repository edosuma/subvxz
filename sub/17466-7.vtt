00:01.291 --> 00:08.000
♪

00:08.000 --> 00:09.542
Hey.

00:09.542 --> 00:11.333
I, uh...

00:11.333 --> 00:13.250
I got some brochures
for our honeymoon.

00:13.250 --> 00:14.959
Lookit, some really
interesting places.

00:14.959 --> 00:17.000
MATT: Hmm?
COLLEEN: Oh.

00:17.000 --> 00:19.083
-They’re all for Hawaii.
-Oh, you like Hawaii, too?

00:19.083 --> 00:20.583
That’s great, it’s settled--
we’re gonna go to Hawaii.

00:20.583 --> 00:23.000
Just imagine it,
we can hold hands

00:23.000 --> 00:24.625
and we can go snorkeling, right?

00:24.625 --> 00:26.542
Yeah, wow, or...

00:26.542 --> 00:28.125
You know where else
we could go?

00:28.125 --> 00:29.375
-Gilroy.
-Gil...

00:29.375 --> 00:31.875
Home of the world’s largest
garlic festival.

00:31.875 --> 00:34.000
What’s wrong with snorkeling
in Hawaii?

00:34.000 --> 00:37.041
Oh, I can’t swim, okay?

00:37.041 --> 00:38.250
How do you not know
how to swim?

00:38.250 --> 00:41.333
My uncle taught everyone
in my family to swim.

00:41.333 --> 00:42.875
But during my first lesson,

00:42.875 --> 00:47.041
I saw his testicles float
out of his swim shorts.

00:47.041 --> 00:49.125
I haven’t gotten
in the water since.

00:49.125 --> 00:50.458
Or eaten figs.

00:50.458 --> 00:53.500
I won’t ever eat them again,
either.

00:53.500 --> 00:55.333
MATT:
Hey, you’re doing great.

00:55.333 --> 00:56.625
All right, I’m going
to let go now.

00:56.625 --> 00:58.333
No, no, no, no!
Don’t let go, don’t let go!

00:58.333 --> 01:00.208
If I go down, you go down with
me! That’s what marriage is.

01:00.208 --> 01:02.458
Okay, we’re in four feet
of water,

01:02.458 --> 01:04.250
so there’s no danger,

01:04.250 --> 01:06.583
and also, I think it would
probably be a pretty good idea

01:06.583 --> 01:09.166
for us to swing by a pre-marital
counselor on our way home.

01:09.166 --> 01:10.667
I’m so sorry,
I just can’t do this.

01:10.667 --> 01:13.125
I will never be able to.

01:13.125 --> 01:17.500
Well, I hate to break it to you,
but you already are.

01:17.500 --> 01:18.750
(screams)

01:18.750 --> 01:20.250
(grunts)

01:20.250 --> 01:21.709
(overlapping shouting)

01:21.709 --> 01:23.667
I got you, I got you,
I got you, I got you.

01:23.667 --> 01:24.750
-(cries)
-Okay!

01:26.417 --> 01:29.000
Okay, all right, now,
just hold on to your noodles

01:29.000 --> 01:30.291
and kick your feet.

01:30.291 --> 01:32.417
And just pretend
that the water is my face.

01:32.417 --> 01:34.208
Is that mask really necessary?

01:34.208 --> 01:36.333
MATT: I’m taking it off.
COLLEEN: Okay.

01:36.333 --> 01:38.291
MATT: All right.
COLLEEN: Okay, ooh, ooh.

01:38.291 --> 01:39.875
I’m doing it!
I’m kicking!

01:39.875 --> 01:41.458
Yay, that’s great.

01:41.458 --> 01:42.959
Okay, now, do it
above the water.

01:42.959 --> 01:44.208
I am doing it above water.

01:44.208 --> 01:45.792
Okay, well,
there’s no splashing,

01:45.792 --> 01:47.000
and somehow you’re not really
going anywhere.

01:47.000 --> 01:49.000
-You calling me a liar, Matt?
-No, no, I believe you,

01:49.000 --> 01:50.417
I believe you, it’s just that,
uh, mmm...

01:50.417 --> 01:51.667
You know what?
Your methods don’t work.

01:51.667 --> 01:52.792
Swimming is dumb.
This is dumb.

01:52.792 --> 01:54.583
Okay, I can hear
that you’re frustrated,

01:54.583 --> 01:56.834
and I’d really love to see you
take some of that frustration

01:56.834 --> 01:58.250
and just channel it
into your kicking.

01:58.250 --> 01:59.458
I am kicking!

01:59.458 --> 02:00.667
Who even swims anymore?

02:00.667 --> 02:03.000
We have cars!

02:03.000 --> 02:04.417
You know what, forget this--
I’m out of here.

02:07.667 --> 02:09.667
Would you please pull me
to the side of the pool

02:09.667 --> 02:11.500
-so I can storm out?
-Sure.

02:11.500 --> 02:12.917
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

02:12.917 --> 02:14.000
Slow down.

02:16.166 --> 02:17.875
Okay.

02:17.875 --> 02:19.583
We need to take
a step back.

02:19.583 --> 02:22.083
-Yeah, mm-hmm.
-I’ve been pushing you too hard.

02:22.083 --> 02:26.208
So this is going to be a lesson
about the physics of swimming.

02:26.208 --> 02:27.834
Oh, yay, I love school.

02:27.834 --> 02:29.375
(screams)

02:31.083 --> 02:32.834
I’m sorry, I know
that this is extreme,

02:32.834 --> 02:35.041
but it’s the way
that my dad taught me

02:35.041 --> 02:36.375
and it never fails.

02:36.375 --> 02:39.125
Colleen?

02:39.125 --> 02:40.500
Oh, jeez.

02:45.667 --> 02:46.625
(sighs)

02:48.250 --> 02:49.583
(coughing)

02:49.583 --> 02:51.083
It’s okay, all right,
all right, all right.

02:51.083 --> 02:52.333
Breathe, breathe,
breathe, breathe.

02:52.333 --> 02:54.041
I’m going to get you a towel,
okay?

02:54.041 --> 02:55.250
Why would you do that?

02:55.250 --> 02:56.417
I could’ve drowned!

02:56.417 --> 02:57.667
I know, I know, I’m sorry.

02:57.667 --> 02:59.291
And I can see now
that you’re not ready

02:59.291 --> 03:00.709
for the second part
of the lesson.

03:00.709 --> 03:02.542
What was it,
pushing me in again?

03:02.542 --> 03:04.125
-Yes.
-Oh, my God. Matt!

03:04.125 --> 03:06.583
Look, I’m telling you how to
swim and you just won’t listen.

03:06.583 --> 03:08.041
Well, maybe you could be nicer!

03:08.041 --> 03:10.083
Maybe you could stop whining.

03:10.083 --> 03:11.583
Wow!

03:11.583 --> 03:13.083
You know what?

03:13.083 --> 03:15.125
Learning something new
can be very stressful,

03:15.125 --> 03:16.792
and it’s really hard
being criticized

03:16.792 --> 03:18.542
by the person who’s supposed
to love you

03:18.542 --> 03:19.959
and accept all your flaws.

03:19.959 --> 03:22.917
I know, I know, you’re right,
you’re right. I’m sorry.

03:22.917 --> 03:25.834
Look, I know you wanted
to teach me how to swim,

03:25.834 --> 03:27.959
but maybe we could have
someone else...

03:27.959 --> 03:29.166
Yeah, great, let’s do it.

03:29.166 --> 03:30.792
Really? You don’t mind?

03:30.792 --> 03:33.250
Baby, whatever gets us
to Hawaii.

03:33.250 --> 03:35.041
You already bought the tickets,
didn’t you?

03:36.667 --> 03:38.333
Great job, Colleen!

03:38.333 --> 03:39.709
I’m so proud of you-- you know,

03:39.709 --> 03:41.709
you’re the only one
who hasn’t peed in the pool?

03:41.709 --> 03:43.125
INSTRUCTOR:
Okay, everybody.

03:43.125 --> 03:44.875
Start blowing your bubbles
again!

03:44.875 --> 03:45.834
(inhale deeply)

03:48.542 --> 03:51.208
Whoo-hoo-hoo! I’m swimming!

03:53.917 --> 03:55.625
Okay, go ahead.

03:55.625 --> 03:57.000
Is the camera running?

03:57.000 --> 03:59.291
I don’t see
the little red light.

03:59.291 --> 04:00.583
It’s a phone, Pop-Pop.

04:00.583 --> 04:03.125
There’s no red light.

04:03.125 --> 04:06.875
Oh, right-- oh, all right,
I’m John Bertram Short.

04:06.875 --> 04:09.959
I’m 70 years old, and I’m
applying to be on<i> Survivor</i>

04:09.959 --> 04:12.417
because surviving
is my middle name.

04:12.417 --> 04:16.083
Wait, did I already say
what my real middle name was?

04:16.083 --> 04:17.333
It doesn’t matter.

04:17.333 --> 04:18.959
Oh, all right, uh...

04:18.959 --> 04:23.250
Yeah, this is more about looks
and, uh, outdoor skills

04:23.250 --> 04:24.917
and lighting a fire
with your bare hands.

04:27.583 --> 04:28.875
That’s your fire cue, Tim.

04:28.875 --> 04:30.250
I know, it’s got
a child lock on it.

04:30.250 --> 04:31.375
You can just cut
this part out.

04:32.667 --> 04:35.166
-Whoa!
-Huh?

04:35.166 --> 04:37.834
-Nice work, John!
-Yeah.

04:37.834 --> 04:39.375
Tim is my son-in-law.

04:39.375 --> 04:41.250
He’ll tell you
how much I love the show.

04:41.250 --> 04:43.291
Oh, yeah, we’re both
huge fans.

04:45.166 --> 04:48.125
(makes wheezing blast)

04:48.125 --> 04:50.417
People always tell me how good
I’d be on the show, too.

04:50.417 --> 04:52.166
You know, surviving
and whatnot.

04:52.166 --> 04:55.667
No, you don’t have what
it takes to be on the show.

04:55.667 --> 04:57.125
You need to manipulate
people,

04:57.125 --> 04:59.583
form an alliance
with some dummy,

04:59.583 --> 05:02.083
and then stab him
in his emaciated back.

05:02.083 --> 05:03.417
Yeah.

05:03.417 --> 05:05.375
The best players are always
finding some way

05:05.375 --> 05:07.500
to outfox someone.

05:07.500 --> 05:11.041
Hey, John, why don’t you let me
be in the video with you?

05:11.041 --> 05:13.709
You know, to show them
how great you’d be?

05:13.709 --> 05:15.250
Yeah, yeah, sure.

05:15.250 --> 05:17.625
It is a good idea
to have an ally.

05:17.625 --> 05:20.250
I’m going to oil up for the next
shot, all right? Yeah.

05:20.250 --> 05:21.709
Yeah, that’s smart-- Sam.

05:21.709 --> 05:22.834
Sam!

05:22.834 --> 05:23.959
Film me.

05:23.959 --> 05:25.917
SAM: Why? I’m supposed
to be filming Pop-Pop.

05:25.917 --> 05:27.542
-How much is he paying you?
SAM: Nothing.

05:27.542 --> 05:28.667
I’ll double it.

05:28.667 --> 05:30.750
I’m turning this
into<i> my </i>audition video now.

05:30.750 --> 05:32.417
SAM: Why don’t you just make
your own?

05:32.417 --> 05:34.208
Because outwitting somebody
in theirs

05:34.208 --> 05:37.041
is the ultimate blindside,
right?

05:37.041 --> 05:39.000
See, this way, Jeff Probst
is going to know

05:39.000 --> 05:41.458
how great I would be at this
and how well I play this game.

05:41.458 --> 05:42.667
All right?

05:42.667 --> 05:45.208
Also, I’ve already submitted
eight times,

05:45.208 --> 05:47.458
and I got to find a new angle,
so...

05:47.458 --> 05:49.083
SAM:
I’m recording.

05:49.083 --> 05:50.709
Dr. Hughes is just verifying

05:50.709 --> 05:52.583
that my health is
off the charts.

05:52.583 --> 05:54.875
Yup, I’m a licensed E.N.T.,
says so

05:54.875 --> 05:56.792
right here on my I.D. badge,
see?

05:56.792 --> 05:59.083
"McDreamy?" Well,
who wrote that there?

05:59.083 --> 06:01.792
Probably one of those naughty
girls at the office.

06:01.792 --> 06:06.000
Well, what the girls like me for
is my wonderful catchphrases,

06:06.000 --> 06:07.792
like, "Catchphrase!"

06:07.792 --> 06:09.375
How’s that pulse, Doc?

06:09.375 --> 06:11.750
A lot better than when you died
on the table last year.

06:11.750 --> 06:13.208
Luckily, I was there
to save you.

06:13.208 --> 06:14.500
You’re the one who killed me.

06:14.500 --> 06:15.667
That’s right.

06:15.667 --> 06:19.834
I can give life
and I can take it away.

06:19.834 --> 06:22.375
I can’t believe they kept me
home from school for this.

06:23.917 --> 06:25.625
Now to show off my stamina.

06:25.625 --> 06:27.834
Hey, thanks for the immunity
necklace, Sam.

06:27.834 --> 06:29.917
SAM: It’s just Mom-Mom’s
wind chimes.

06:29.917 --> 06:31.583
Oh.

06:31.583 --> 06:34.250
Oh, anyway, now I’m going
to stand on this log.

06:34.250 --> 06:35.792
(necklace rattling)

06:35.792 --> 06:37.625
I’m just making sure
it’s steady.

06:37.625 --> 06:40.041
I don’t want you
to fall and sue,

06:40.041 --> 06:42.291
which is kind of
your thing.

06:42.291 --> 06:45.125
Oh, been two hours,
time to go to one foot.

06:45.125 --> 06:48.041
What are you talking about?
You just climbed up there.

06:48.041 --> 06:49.041
(screaming, Sam yelping)

06:50.917 --> 06:52.667
Now we’re going to show
how good I look

06:52.667 --> 06:55.125
coming up out of the water
in slow motion.

06:55.125 --> 06:57.125
SAM: Oh, hold on, I’ll turn on
the slow motion.

06:57.125 --> 06:58.625
JOHN:
No, no.

06:58.625 --> 07:00.375
I’ll just move up slowly,

07:00.375 --> 07:03.583
show them how water beads up
off of well-tanned leather.

07:05.500 --> 07:06.750
Where did you get
that buff?

07:06.750 --> 07:09.458
Oh, I go to the gym
a lot.

07:09.458 --> 07:11.083
No, I mean that thing
on your head.

07:11.083 --> 07:13.041
-That’s called a buff.
-Oh, I know.

07:13.041 --> 07:15.166
I was just pointing out
that I’m a doctor

07:15.166 --> 07:18.041
who also goes
to the gym a lot.

07:18.041 --> 07:20.333
Wait a second,
what are you saying?

07:20.333 --> 07:22.291
Are you trying
to steal my audition?

07:22.291 --> 07:23.709
What? No!

07:23.709 --> 07:25.875
-What?
-You are!

07:25.875 --> 07:27.125
SAM:
I’ll get Mom-Mom.

07:27.125 --> 07:29.625
Oh, that is amazing.

07:29.625 --> 07:34.083
It’s like how my mom and
uncle-dad fight in the tub.

07:34.083 --> 07:36.166
TIM: How are you so strong?
You’re, like, 100!

07:36.166 --> 07:37.709
(struggling)

07:37.709 --> 07:41.959
So this clown tried to dupe me,
but I sniffed him out,

07:41.959 --> 07:43.417
which shows I’m cut out to be

07:43.417 --> 07:46.083
on any island you
can maroon me on.

07:46.083 --> 07:47.959
Well, I’m sorry, John,
you outplayed me.

07:47.959 --> 07:49.792
So I’ll tell you what,
to make it up to you,

07:49.792 --> 07:51.667
I’m going to edit
this whole thing together

07:51.667 --> 07:53.333
to show the real winner.

07:53.333 --> 07:56.333
I’ll even end it with a montage
set to some cool music.

07:56.333 --> 07:57.750
Really?

07:57.750 --> 08:01.959

(grunting and bellowing)

08:40.375 --> 08:42.750
(audio stops)

08:42.750 --> 08:44.750
I mean, I’ve been doing this
a long time,

08:44.750 --> 08:47.959
but sometimes it is so obvious
who you should cast,

08:47.959 --> 08:49.083
it’s almost annoying.

08:49.083 --> 08:50.250
I hear you.

08:50.250 --> 08:51.959
It’s a no-brainer.

08:51.959 --> 08:54.041
(video rewinding)

08:54.041 --> 08:56.125
Slam dunk--
get her info.

08:57.542 --> 08:59.291
Who put all of our gum
in the fridge?

08:59.291 --> 09:01.250
Oh, the same guy who read
the listicle entitled,

09:01.250 --> 09:02.667
"30 Ways
You’re Doing Gum Wrong."

09:07.041 --> 09:08.417
(knock at door)

09:08.417 --> 09:10.083
Hi, honey.

09:10.083 --> 09:11.792
Hey, Mom, Dad.

09:11.792 --> 09:14.000
JOHN: Yeah, surprise.
We were in the neighborhood

09:14.000 --> 09:16.083
because we were driving
over here.

09:16.083 --> 09:18.041
JOAN: Got a little bored
at our house.

09:18.041 --> 09:19.291
Where’s Jen?

09:19.291 --> 09:21.417
Oh, uh, she just started
meditating.

09:21.417 --> 09:23.291
Yeah, she’ll be out
in 20 minutes.

09:23.291 --> 09:24.667
Ooh!

09:24.667 --> 09:26.834
That’s a high hill to climb.

09:26.834 --> 09:29.500
WOMAN:
<i>Take a deep, cleansing breath.</i>

09:29.500 --> 09:31.417
(blowing out through lips)

09:31.417 --> 09:33.458
<i>For the next 20 minutes,</i>
<i>close your eyes...</i>

09:33.458 --> 09:35.000
-Hi-ya.
WOMAN:<i> ...and make friends...</i>

09:35.000 --> 09:36.125
(clears throat)

09:36.125 --> 09:38.291
<i>...with the black, expansive</i>
<i>openness behind your eyelids.</i>

09:38.291 --> 09:39.875
All right, app lady.

09:39.875 --> 09:41.417
Give it to me real, here we go.

09:41.417 --> 09:42.583
I’m ready.

09:42.583 --> 09:43.875
I’m getting Zen with it.

09:43.875 --> 09:45.333
WOMAN:
<i>Focus on your breath.</i>

09:45.333 --> 09:46.959
(sighs)

09:46.959 --> 09:48.125
Super-bored.

09:48.125 --> 09:50.000
This is<i> très </i>boring.

09:50.000 --> 09:52.834
Oh, my God, wow.

09:52.834 --> 09:55.417
Time is really standing still,
okay.

09:55.417 --> 09:57.208
Mm-hmm.

09:57.208 --> 10:00.750
<i>WOMAN: Imagine the stress</i>
<i>evaporating from your earlobes.</i>

10:00.750 --> 10:02.792
My earlobes? No, I can’t.

10:02.792 --> 10:06.458
I just can’t, I’m sorry,
don’t know you, and I hate you.

10:08.750 --> 10:10.333
-(laser sounds from phone)
-Oh, oh!

10:10.333 --> 10:13.083
Yeah, yeah,
yes, I did laser you.

10:13.083 --> 10:15.417
And now you are dead.

10:15.417 --> 10:16.583
Go, go, go-- go, go, go!

10:16.583 --> 10:18.000
(bell dings)

10:18.000 --> 10:20.709
WOMAN:
<i>Your meditation has concluded.</i>

10:20.709 --> 10:24.834
<i>Now open your eyes</i>
<i>and notice how you feel.</i>

10:24.834 --> 10:26.250
Well, I feel great.

10:26.250 --> 10:28.333
Now that I’ve showed
those aliens who’s boss.

10:28.333 --> 10:29.458
Ha!

10:29.458 --> 10:32.500
(television playing)

10:32.500 --> 10:33.750
Oh, look at you!

10:33.750 --> 10:37.250
Your face,
it’s just glowing.

10:37.250 --> 10:40.083
It’s like whatever’s been
pinching you all these years,

10:40.083 --> 10:41.792
it finally let go.

10:41.792 --> 10:43.542
Oh, well...

10:43.542 --> 10:45.208
-Thank you.
-So it’s working?

10:45.208 --> 10:46.750
Yeah, oh, yeah.

10:46.750 --> 10:47.875
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

10:47.875 --> 10:48.959
You know what?

10:48.959 --> 10:52.291
I think meditation is my jam.

10:52.291 --> 10:54.834
Whatever sands
those rough edges.

10:54.834 --> 10:56.375
It seems like a good time
to tell you

10:56.375 --> 10:58.083
we’re going to be staying here
next week

10:58.083 --> 10:59.250
while we have our house tented.

10:59.250 --> 11:00.250
Excuse me, what?

11:00.250 --> 11:01.875
Cool, that sounds fun.

11:01.875 --> 11:03.500
A little family slumber party.

11:03.500 --> 11:05.875
See? And you said
she’d say something biting.

11:05.875 --> 11:07.208
No, I didn’t.

11:07.208 --> 11:08.583
Yes, you did,
you talked about it

11:08.583 --> 11:09.834
the whole way over
in the car.

11:09.834 --> 11:11.458
You said you weren’t going

11:11.458 --> 11:12.792
to let it ruin your night.

11:14.166 --> 11:15.959
Know what?

11:15.959 --> 11:18.166
I’m listening to my body
right now,

11:18.166 --> 11:22.542
and my body is telling me
it needs round<i> dos.</i>

11:22.542 --> 11:24.041
So I’m going to get my ’tate on,

11:24.041 --> 11:26.291
and I will see you party animals
in 20 minutes.

11:26.291 --> 11:27.250
Okay?

11:28.542 --> 11:30.959
Oh, you’re on a spiritual path.

11:38.875 --> 11:41.291
And that, my friends...

11:41.291 --> 11:42.709
(loudly):
...is Yahtzee!

11:42.709 --> 11:46.333
(whispers): It’s Yahtzee.
Oh, boy, oh, my God.

11:46.333 --> 11:49.625
(mumbling contentedly)

11:49.625 --> 11:51.917
Talk to me, Trina.

11:51.917 --> 11:54.500
Ah, whoa,
oh,<i> that’s </i>a spot!

11:56.458 --> 11:57.792
(bell dings)

11:57.792 --> 12:00.917
WOMAN:
<i>Your meditation has concluded.</i>

12:00.917 --> 12:02.875
(sighs contentedly)

12:02.875 --> 12:04.083
No, no, no.

12:04.083 --> 12:06.125
So I am, I am
in the operating theater

12:06.125 --> 12:07.667
for the very first time
in my life,

12:07.667 --> 12:09.500
and just as the surgeon
is about to cut

12:09.500 --> 12:11.917
into the lady
on the table, I lose it.

12:11.917 --> 12:15.125
And by "it," I mean two burritos
and a pumpkin pie!

12:15.125 --> 12:17.333
I mean, I throw up
all over the floor.

12:17.333 --> 12:19.625
Before he knew it, this doctor,
he’s got two patients

12:19.625 --> 12:20.750
-all of a sudden.
-Two!

12:20.750 --> 12:23.125
Do you know what?
Will you excuse me?

12:23.125 --> 12:25.834
It’s actually time for
my daily meditation practice.

12:25.834 --> 12:27.125
Oh, Jen, yeah,
go, go, go, go!

12:27.125 --> 12:28.667
Oh, I love
that you are just tapping

12:28.667 --> 12:29.875
into your Zen like that.

12:29.875 --> 12:31.000
Yeah, use our bedroom.

12:31.000 --> 12:32.291
It’s for a good cause--

12:32.291 --> 12:34.750
Jen’s never-ending search
for happiness.

12:34.750 --> 12:36.667
Okay, well...

12:38.291 --> 12:39.917
I’m really proud of her.

12:39.917 --> 12:42.208
She’s really sticking with it,
meditates every day.

12:42.208 --> 12:43.458
I don’t even journal every day.

12:44.834 --> 12:47.333
-(phone beeping)
-Oh, come on.

12:47.333 --> 12:49.041
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
get that mushroom cloud.

12:49.041 --> 12:51.291
(knock at door)

12:51.291 --> 12:52.291
Oh, no!

12:54.417 --> 12:56.417
(softly):
Hey, I’m sorry to interrupt,

12:56.417 --> 12:57.625
I just had to get away.

12:57.625 --> 12:58.834
What? Sorry. Oof.

12:58.834 --> 13:00.542
Just give me a second,

13:00.542 --> 13:03.041
I was just... so deep.

13:03.041 --> 13:04.542
Ah, I’m sorry.

13:04.542 --> 13:06.166
MAN (on phone):
<i>Mushroom cloud! Level up!</i>

13:06.166 --> 13:07.583
(video game sound effect plays)

13:07.583 --> 13:09.625
Was that a video game?

13:09.625 --> 13:12.834
Mmm? No. Mm-mmm, no.
That’s crazy. What?

13:16.125 --> 13:17.625
Yes, I’m so sorry.

13:17.625 --> 13:18.750
Oh, my God, I’m so sorry.

13:18.750 --> 13:20.166
It’s just, meditation...

13:20.166 --> 13:22.917
sucks... for me, personally.

13:22.917 --> 13:24.750
Not for, like,
the world at large.

13:24.750 --> 13:27.125
Like, I’d rather be checking
Facebook or playing games.

13:27.125 --> 13:29.208
Or, like seeing what ’80s stars
look like now.

13:29.208 --> 13:31.458
Number 17 really did shock me.

13:31.458 --> 13:32.917
That’s more my meditation.

13:32.917 --> 13:35.834
I cannot believe this, Jen.

13:35.834 --> 13:37.875
This is why you’ve been
excusing yourself

13:37.875 --> 13:39.750
from family dinners
and gatherings?

13:39.750 --> 13:41.000
To play video games?

13:41.000 --> 13:42.959
(whispers):
I’m sorry.

13:42.959 --> 13:45.166
That’s the best thing
I’ve ever heard of.

13:45.166 --> 13:46.834
What? Really?

13:46.834 --> 13:48.041
Yes!

13:48.041 --> 13:50.083
Major life hack, right?
Because you can’t tell people

13:50.083 --> 13:51.458
you need 20 minutes
of "me time."

13:51.458 --> 13:52.458
We are grown-ass people.

13:52.458 --> 13:55.083
But if you tell them you’re
meditating, they celebrate you.

13:55.083 --> 13:56.750
-I want in, yeah.
-Yeah.

13:56.750 --> 13:58.959
Because I can’t listen
to any more of Tim’s stories.

13:58.959 --> 14:00.125
You missed the end.

14:00.125 --> 14:01.792
That woman on the table died.

14:01.792 --> 14:02.917
No.

14:02.917 --> 14:04.709
And she was a senator.

14:04.709 --> 14:06.166
(gasps)

14:06.166 --> 14:07.625
Well, a state senator,
but still.

14:07.625 --> 14:09.625
Still.

14:14.000 --> 14:16.125
(Colleen clears throat)

14:16.125 --> 14:18.333
COLLEEN: Jen, will you ask
Matt to pass the water?

14:18.333 --> 14:19.500
Greg, will you please
inform Colleen

14:19.500 --> 14:20.667
that she won’t drown in it?

14:20.667 --> 14:21.667
(whispers):
Oh, wow.

14:21.667 --> 14:24.083
Wow, look at the time.

14:24.083 --> 14:25.959
Yeah, time to meditate.

14:25.959 --> 14:28.333
Oh, wow, that must be
really nice for you guys

14:28.333 --> 14:29.959
to have something
you can do together

14:29.959 --> 14:31.458
that doesn’t tear you apart.

14:31.458 --> 14:33.500
Well, probably because you’re
both at the same skill level.

14:33.500 --> 14:34.625
(slurping)

14:34.625 --> 14:36.375
That is so low.

14:36.375 --> 14:38.458
Okay, I’m going to need
a stronger mantra.

14:38.458 --> 14:40.375
Aah...

14:42.250 --> 14:44.667
(chuckles): I love that
you’re doing this for me.

14:44.667 --> 14:46.750
-I can’t wait to see it.
-Mm-hmm.

14:46.750 --> 14:49.709
What is it?
Is it, like, a French braid?

14:49.709 --> 14:51.166
No, but trust me,

14:51.166 --> 14:53.458
you are going to look
like a princess.

14:55.333 --> 14:57.291
It’s Princess Leia,
isn’t it?

14:57.291 --> 14:58.417
Yeah.

14:58.417 --> 14:59.917
Not putting on the outfit.

14:59.917 --> 15:01.166
(disappointed):
Oh.

15:01.166 --> 15:03.875
WOMAN:
<i>Your meditation has concluded.</i>

15:06.500 --> 15:08.667
Boobs-- what are they?

15:08.667 --> 15:10.792
When will I get them,
and what do I do with them?

15:10.792 --> 15:12.625
Did Clementine have
a tank top on this morning?

15:17.959 --> 15:20.625
Hey, sweetie, I just made some
turds on a log, you want some?

15:20.625 --> 15:22.041
No, thanks.

15:22.041 --> 15:24.959
My stomach hurts too much
to eat turds.

15:24.959 --> 15:26.250
Uh-oh, what’s wrong, kiddo?

15:26.250 --> 15:28.583
I think I might be pregnant.

15:28.583 --> 15:30.458
(chokes and coughs)

15:30.458 --> 15:31.625
You got it,
you got it.

15:31.625 --> 15:32.917
Hey, that’s interesting.

15:32.917 --> 15:34.917
So why do you
think that?

15:34.917 --> 15:36.917
Well, my friend Molly told me

15:36.917 --> 15:39.125
that if you sit on the toilet
for more than a minute,

15:39.125 --> 15:40.375
you get pregnant.

15:40.375 --> 15:43.417
Honey, we, we talked
about this, okay?

15:43.417 --> 15:44.834
Molly is an idiot.

15:44.834 --> 15:46.542
Also, that’s not
how you get pregnant.

15:46.542 --> 15:47.959
Yeah, otherwise
Daddy would be

15:47.959 --> 15:49.625
the most pregnant person
in the world.

15:49.625 --> 15:51.458
(sighs):
Thank goodness.

15:51.458 --> 15:54.041
I had no idea
who the father was.

15:55.291 --> 15:57.834
Okay, she is so confused.

15:57.834 --> 16:00.458
Ah, she’ll figure it out
in college.

16:01.875 --> 16:03.583
Mmm.

16:03.583 --> 16:05.291
-This is fun, Mommy.
-Yeah.

16:05.291 --> 16:06.792
I like hanging out,
just us two.

16:06.792 --> 16:07.709
Me, too.

16:07.709 --> 16:09.208
(whispers):
We’re the best ones.

16:09.208 --> 16:10.750
Right?

16:10.750 --> 16:12.875
-Bam.
-Mmm.

16:15.083 --> 16:16.875
Hey, remember how
this afternoon,

16:16.875 --> 16:18.458
you thought
that you were pregnant?

16:18.458 --> 16:20.500
Oh, yeah,
dodged a bullet there.

16:20.500 --> 16:22.208
Yeah, tell me about it.

16:22.208 --> 16:25.417
Listen, it made me think
that it’s probably time

16:25.417 --> 16:30.583
for you to learn how women
actually become pregnant.

16:30.583 --> 16:31.834
Have you heard of sex?

16:31.834 --> 16:33.208
Is that the present
that Tyler

16:33.208 --> 16:35.041
always surprises
Clementine with?

16:35.041 --> 16:36.542
What?

16:36.542 --> 16:38.250
He’s always asking her
if she likes it

16:38.250 --> 16:39.333
when he gives it to her.

16:40.917 --> 16:43.792
That’s... nice.
That’s... uh-huh.

16:43.792 --> 16:47.458
No, um, sex is something
really special

16:47.458 --> 16:50.667
between two adults
who love each other.

16:50.667 --> 16:52.875
-Like you and Daddy.
-Exactly.

16:52.875 --> 16:56.208
-Or you and Uncle Matt.
-No, no, no, uh...

16:56.208 --> 16:58.792
But you love him, don’t you?
And he’s so cute.

16:58.792 --> 17:01.125
That, that’s a different
kind of love.

17:01.125 --> 17:02.583
It’s also illegal.

17:02.583 --> 17:04.667
But a great question.

17:04.667 --> 17:06.083
So you just lead the way

17:06.083 --> 17:08.750
and we are not going to stop
until you get all your answers.

17:08.750 --> 17:10.500
How much time do you have?

17:10.500 --> 17:12.041
Because I’ve been wanting

17:12.041 --> 17:15.000
to take this conversation
past cooties for years now.

17:16.542 --> 17:17.959
(bell ringing)

17:17.959 --> 17:19.500
Sex.

17:19.500 --> 17:21.875
It seems to be all your daughter
Sophia can talk about.

17:21.875 --> 17:23.208
(laughs):
Okay, well...

17:23.208 --> 17:25.250
I had "the talk" with her
recently.

17:25.250 --> 17:26.875
You know, Sophia had
some questions,

17:26.875 --> 17:29.375
and we thought that she should
get answers from one of us

17:29.375 --> 17:32.333
instead of, you know,
a misinformed student

17:32.333 --> 17:34.208
or Nicki Minaj.

17:34.208 --> 17:37.333
Yes, but she wrote a story
about Dora.

17:37.333 --> 17:41.417
And I don’t appreciate
what Dora is exploring.

17:41.417 --> 17:42.917
(softly):
Look at that, that’s cute.

17:42.917 --> 17:44.792
I don’t know where
she learned all this from.

17:44.792 --> 17:46.583
You just gave her
the basic talk, right?

17:46.583 --> 17:49.000
Yeah, it was just a little bit
more than basic.

17:49.000 --> 17:50.792
Just like a basic-plus,
like a...

17:50.792 --> 17:52.792
-What?!
-Oh, my gosh.

17:52.792 --> 17:54.709
You wouldn’t even answer
<i>my </i>questions about<i> that.</i>

17:54.709 --> 17:55.875
That is such good...

17:55.875 --> 17:57.667
Lookit, she is, like,
so in the lines on that.

17:57.667 --> 17:59.208
I don’t know why
you wouldn’t just give her

17:59.208 --> 18:00.959
the same kind of talk
I gave Tyler.

18:00.959 --> 18:03.417
Our son, you know, I just used
a plug and a wall socket.

18:03.417 --> 18:04.625
I got electrocuted,

18:04.625 --> 18:06.417
but by the time I came to,
it was all over.

18:06.417 --> 18:08.041
HEATHER:
I thought that I should

18:08.041 --> 18:11.417
let Sophia’s questions
guide the conversation.

18:11.417 --> 18:13.333
You know, I mean,
I feel like we should just

18:13.333 --> 18:14.834
be able to talk
about sex-- sex!

18:14.834 --> 18:17.166
You know, I don’t want her
to feel shameful

18:17.166 --> 18:19.041
about her sexuality--
don’t you agree?

18:19.041 --> 18:20.166
No, I do not.

18:20.166 --> 18:21.333
Oh.

18:21.333 --> 18:23.041
And apparently
during this talk,

18:23.041 --> 18:24.291
Sophia was drinking beer?

18:24.291 --> 18:25.709
My beers?!

18:25.709 --> 18:27.333
(laughs):
Root beers.

18:27.333 --> 18:28.709
-My root beers?!
-Okay.

18:28.709 --> 18:31.125
Um, I’ll talk to her,

18:31.125 --> 18:36.041
and tell her not to talk
about sex at school,

18:36.041 --> 18:37.542
and this will never
happen again.

18:37.542 --> 18:39.000
-Thank you!
-You’re welcome.

18:39.000 --> 18:41.458
I mean, I buy them--
I should drink them!

18:41.458 --> 18:43.750
He’s talking
about the root beers.

18:43.750 --> 18:45.583
Yeah, not the kids,
I didn’t buy the kids.

18:45.583 --> 18:47.208
I made them--
like this.

18:52.208 --> 18:53.917
-Waaa...
-(chuckles)

18:53.917 --> 18:55.625
Mmm.

18:55.625 --> 18:58.375
Hey, remember that talk
we had about sex?

18:58.375 --> 18:59.750
-Uh-huh.
-I want you to know

18:59.750 --> 19:02.166
that’s not something
that you share at school.

19:02.166 --> 19:04.834
Okay? That’s
a private conversation

19:04.834 --> 19:07.500
that you have at home,
with your family.

19:07.500 --> 19:09.709
In private--
it’s private.

19:09.709 --> 19:11.000
(laughs)

19:11.000 --> 19:12.583
What’s so funny?

19:12.583 --> 19:16.000
You said the word "private,"
like, ten times.

19:16.000 --> 19:17.625
Okay, but you get it, right?

19:17.625 --> 19:19.834
That’s just for family.

19:19.834 --> 19:21.542
-Got it-- just family.
-Okay, all right, good.

19:21.542 --> 19:22.959
Let’s get back
to our brewskis.

19:22.959 --> 19:24.625
Man, I could drink
these beers all day.

19:24.625 --> 19:26.500
Right?

19:26.500 --> 19:28.417
COLLEEN: Thank you so much
for having us.

19:28.417 --> 19:30.291
I’m sorry that Matt and I
were a little late.

19:30.291 --> 19:31.667
SOPHIA:
You guys having some sex?

19:33.291 --> 19:35.792
Sophia!

19:35.792 --> 19:37.792
You sure this is the level
of openness that you want?

19:37.792 --> 19:40.291
Absolutely-- we’re not going
to have any shame about sex.

19:40.291 --> 19:41.291
We should.

19:41.291 --> 19:43.458
Okay, listen,
Sophia and I

19:43.458 --> 19:45.083
recently had "the talk,"

19:45.083 --> 19:47.542
and I let her know
that sex is something

19:47.542 --> 19:49.542
that she can always discuss
with her family.

19:49.542 --> 19:52.792
Mom can’t have sex with you,
though, Uncle Matt.

19:52.792 --> 19:54.542
I’ll explain it
to you later.

19:54.542 --> 19:56.125
Oh, honey, no,
there’s really no need

19:56.125 --> 19:57.542
to explain
why that can’t happen.

19:57.542 --> 19:58.458
He’s got it.

19:58.458 --> 20:00.041
JOAN:
Good for you, Heather.

20:00.041 --> 20:03.333
I mean, sex is such a wonderful
and a healthy thing.

20:03.333 --> 20:07.959
No child should be afraid
to ask any questions about it.

20:07.959 --> 20:09.375
Right, everybody?

20:09.375 --> 20:11.458
(all exclaiming)

20:11.458 --> 20:14.083
Is it true that you can
have sex with yourself?

20:14.083 --> 20:16.000
(all clearing throats,
coughing softly)

20:16.000 --> 20:17.375
Will you excuse me?
Uh, I got...

20:17.375 --> 20:19.208
-We have to go meditate.
-We got to meditate.

20:19.208 --> 20:21.792
-Oh, I’d love to try meditation.
MATT: Yep, me, too.

20:21.792 --> 20:23.834
I love learning new things
from family.

20:23.834 --> 20:26.125
TYLER: Yeah, I’m going to go
meditate, as well.

20:26.125 --> 20:29.500
It’s my house-- if anybody gets
to meditate, it’s me.

20:29.500 --> 20:32.709
Meditate?
They’re saying it wrong.

20:32.709 --> 20:34.834
And you’re supposed to do it
by yourself!
