YOUR SUPERPOWER,

00:06.407 --> 00:09.043
WOULD YOU RATHER BE ABLE
TO TURN YOURSELF INVISIBLE

00:09.077 --> 00:10.244
OR FLY?

00:10.278 --> 00:12.746
- FLY.

00:12.780 --> 00:14.315
- YOU'RE NOT EVEN GONNA
GIVE THAT ANY THOUGHT?

00:14.348 --> 00:15.916
- OH, I'VE GIVEN IT
A LOT OF THOUGHT.

00:15.949 --> 00:17.485
I THINK IT WOULD BE SUPER COOL
TO PICK UP AND FLY.

00:17.518 --> 00:19.053
COME ON, WHENEVER, WHEREVER.

00:19.087 --> 00:20.388

IF YOU WERE INVISIBLE,

00:20.421 --> 00:21.655
YOU COULD SEE ANYONE YOU WANTED
NAKED.

00:21.689 --> 00:23.023
- YOU REALIZE THAT
IF I COULD FLY

00:23.057 --> 00:24.425
I COULD SEE ANYONE I WANTED
NAKED.

00:24.458 --> 00:26.160
HEY, HOW YOU DOING?

[siren wails]

00:37.638 --> 00:40.174
- DON'T GET ME WRONG,
I WOULD LOVE TO FLY,

00:40.208 --> 00:42.443
BUT I THINK I WOULD HAVE
TO GO WITH INVISIBILITY.

00:42.476 --> 00:45.546
MOSTLY FOR ITS CRIME-FIGHTING
POSSIBILITIES.

00:45.579 --> 00:47.115
- SOUNDS KIND OF SNEAKY TO ME.

00:47.148 --> 00:49.350
- YEAH, VERY SNEAKY.
- SNEAKY, THAT'S GOOD.

00:49.383 --> 00:50.418
THAT'S WHY I'D BE INVISIBLE TOO.

01:11.805 --> 01:13.374
- THIRD FLOOR?
HOW BIG IS THIS PLACE?

01:13.407 --> 01:15.809
- CONSIDERING THE WHOLE
FIRST FLOOR WAS A JUICE BAR?

01:15.843 --> 01:17.645
- I SCOPED THIS PLACE OUT
WHEN I WAS LOOKING FOR A GYM.

01:17.678 --> 01:19.713
IT IS CRAZY EXPENSIVE.

01:19.747 --> 01:21.081
I WOULDN'T PAY THAT MUCH
FOR RENT.

01:21.115 --> 01:23.284
AND I KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE GONNA SAY.

01:23.317 --> 01:25.419
"BRIAN, YOU DON'T PAY RENT; YOU
STILL LIVE WITH YOUR PARENTS.

01:25.453 --> 01:27.421
DO YOU EVEN KNOW HOW MUCH
RENTS ARE GOING FOR THESE DAYS?"

AND TO YOU, I WOULD SAY,
"IF RENT IS ANYWHERE

01:30.658 --> 01:34.128
NEAR WHAT IT COSTS TO GO TO
THIS GYM, NO, THANK YOU, RENT."

01:34.162 --> 01:36.397
MY GYM IS THE CHEAPEST GYM
IN THE CITY.

01:36.430 --> 01:38.799
IT'S GREAT,
AND IT'S ALWAYS OPEN.

01:38.832 --> 01:41.335
WELL, SOMETIMES THEY CLOSE IT

I EVER WANTED TO DO THAT THING

01:52.313 --> 01:53.647
THEY DO IN CARTOONS
WHERE THEY RUB THEIR EYES

01:53.681 --> 01:55.082

WITH THE PRICES I PAY,
I EXPECT PROPER CALIBRATION!

02:26.714 --> 02:28.516

02:52.273 --> 02:53.741
LANCE.
- YEAH, WHY?

02:53.774 --> 02:55.376
- YOU JUST DON'T LOOK
LIKE A LANCE.

02:55.409 --> 02:56.710
NEVER WOULD'VE GUESSED.

02:56.744 --> 02:58.312
- WHAT ARE LANCES
SUPPOSED TO LOOK LIKE?

02:58.346 --> 03:01.215
- LANCE ARMSTRONG, LANCE BASS,
LANCE BURTON.

03:01.249 --> 03:02.983
- WHO?

03:03.016 --> 03:06.420
- MAGICIAN, HE RETIRED IN 2010
AT HIS ABSOLUTE PRIME.

03:06.454 --> 03:08.889
ANYWAYS, IT JUST SEEMS
THAT ALL LANCES SHARE A CERTAIN,

03:08.922 --> 03:11.725
I DON'T KNOW,
AERODYNAMIC BODY TYPE.

03:11.759 --> 03:13.093
- YOU'RE SAYING
I'M NOT AERODYNAMIC ENOUGH

03:13.126 --> 03:14.194
TO BE A LANCE?

03:14.228 --> 03:15.729
- IT'S NOT A BAD THING.

03:15.763 --> 03:16.664
YOU'D SMOKE THOSE GUYS
IN UPPER BODY STRENGTH.

03:16.697 --> 03:18.232
- YEAH, I WOULD.

03:18.266 --> 03:20.534
ESPECIALLY ARMSTRONG.
BICYCLE BITCH.

- YEAH, SO?

03:26.740 --> 03:28.442
I CAN HANDLE IT.
- REALLY?

03:28.476 --> 03:30.511
- WHEN THE MACHINE
IS CALIBRATED RIGHT.

03:30.544 --> 03:31.512
- REALLY?

03:31.545 --> 03:33.614
THAT'S A LOT OF WEIGHTS.

03:33.647 --> 03:36.450
- I KNOW,
BUT I LIKE TO PUSH MYSELF.

03:36.484 --> 03:38.118
THAT'S HOW YOU GET STRONG.

03:38.151 --> 03:40.354
- YOU KNOW, LANCE,
SOMETIMES THE STRONGEST THING

03:40.388 --> 03:44.892
A MAN CAN DO IS ADMIT WHEN
HE'S CARRYING TOO MUCH WEIGHT.

03:44.925 --> 03:49.763
- SOMETIMES I DO PUSH MYSELF
TOO HARD, I GUESS.

03:49.797 --> 03:52.099
- THAT'S THE AMAZING THING
ABOUT THE HUMAN BODY, LANCE.

03:52.132 --> 03:54.268
IT'LL LET YOU KNOW
WHEN YOU NEED TO SLOW DOWN.

03:54.302 --> 03:56.537
YOU JUST GOT TO LISTEN TO IT,
AM I RIGHT?

03:56.570 --> 03:58.606
- I'VE JUST BEEN RUNNING
TOO HARD FOR TOO LONG, MAN.

03:58.639 --> 04:02.443
- YEAH, YEAH, IT'S OKAY.
RIGHT, GUYS?

04:02.476 --> 04:06.380
- UH-HUH.

04:06.414 --> 04:09.717

04:09.750 --> 04:12.653
- UNLIMITED PASSES TO
THE SEXIEST GYM ON THE PLANET.

04:12.686 --> 04:13.654
BRIAN, YOU'RE THE FREAKING MAN.

04:13.687 --> 04:14.988
- YOU'RE THE CHAMP.

04:15.022 --> 04:16.757
- CAN I SIT SHOTGUN TOMORROW?
- NO.

04:16.790 --> 04:18.258
- YOU KNOW, THAT GYM IS GONNA
BE MY NEW HOME AWAY FROM HOME.

04:18.292 --> 04:19.827
WE WERE THERE FOR, WHAT,

04:19.860 --> 04:22.296
LIKE, TEN MINUTES,
AND I SAW SIDE BOOB, TOP BOOB,

04:22.330 --> 04:24.965
AND IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN,
A LITTLE UNDER-BOOB.

04:24.998 --> 04:27.134
AND I GOT TO SAY,
THAT'S A SPECIAL TREAT.

04:27.167 --> 04:29.002
DID YOU NOTICE THAT?
- I DID NOT NOTICE THAT.

04:29.036 --> 04:31.739
BUT DID ANYONE ELSE HAPPEN
TO CLOCK ALL THE D'ANGELO Vs

04:31.772 --> 04:32.806
JUST WALKING AROUND?

04:32.840 --> 04:34.274
- WHAT ARE D'ANGELO Vs?

04:34.308 --> 04:35.843
- YOU KNOW, WHEN THE DUDE'S GOT
ABS SO RIPPED,

04:35.876 --> 04:37.611
THEY GET THAT V-SHAPE
RIGHT HERE.

04:37.645 --> 04:39.647
FIRST TIME I SAW IT WAS
IN A D'ANGELO MUSIC VIDEO

04:39.680 --> 04:40.981
FROM, LIKE, 15 YEARS AGO.

04:41.014 --> 04:43.584
HE WAS ALL NAKED
AND ALONE IN THE DARK, SWEATING,

04:43.617 --> 04:44.985
FOR SOME REASON SPINNING.

04:45.018 --> 04:46.820
AND HE HAD THOSE ABS SO RIPPED,

04:46.854 --> 04:47.921
LOOKED LIKE A SEXY G.I. JOE.

04:47.955 --> 04:49.623
- DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT THAT.

04:49.657 --> 04:51.124
- WELL, I DON'T WANT
TO TALK ABOUT UNDER-BOOB.

04:51.158 --> 04:52.593
I DON'T CARE FOR IT.
- WHAT ABOUT ASSES?

04:52.626 --> 04:54.261
- WELL, I LOVE ASSES.
- EVERYONE LOVES ASSES.

04:54.294 --> 04:55.195
- YOU'RE RIGHT.
EVERYONE LOVES ASSES.

04:55.228 --> 04:56.530
- WE CAN ALL AGREE ON ASSES.

04:56.564 --> 04:57.698
- ASSES ARE
THE SEXUAL TOWN SQUARE.

04:57.731 --> 04:59.667
- ASSES UNITE US.

04:59.700 --> 05:02.970
- * WE GOT FREE PASSES
TO CHECK OUT SOME FINE ASSES *

05:03.003 --> 05:05.673

05:11.078 --> 05:13.347
- YOU GUYS,
I DIDN'T NOTICE ANY BUTTS.

05:13.381 --> 05:15.015
- HUH?
- NOT ONE.

05:15.048 --> 05:16.850
- YOU'RE GONNA TELL ME
YOU DIDN'T CHECK OUT

05:16.884 --> 05:18.786
ONE GIRL ON THAT CALL?

05:18.819 --> 05:21.689
- NO.
WHOA.

05:21.722 --> 05:23.891
YOU GUYS, I THINK
ALL THIS NOT HAVING SEX WITH VOO

05:23.924 --> 05:25.793
MIGHT HAVE DONE SOMETHING TO ME.

05:25.826 --> 05:29.029
- WHAT, YOU THINK THAT DATING
AN ASEXUAL MADE YOU BUTT-BLIND?

05:29.062 --> 05:30.564
- I DON'T KNOW, BUT SOMETHING'S
DEFINITELY DIFFERENT.

05:30.598 --> 05:31.732
- YOU CAN'T CHANGE
YOUR SEXUALITY.

05:31.765 --> 05:32.966
- HOW DO YOU KNOW, HANK?

05:33.000 --> 05:35.135
- JUST LET IT--JUST--

05:35.168 --> 05:38.338
- I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S
THAT I'VE CHANGED MY SEXUALITY,

05:38.372 --> 05:41.542
MORE LIKE TRANSCENDED IT.

05:41.575 --> 05:43.544
YEAH, I THINK THAT'S IT.

05:43.577 --> 05:46.079
I AM A TRANSCENDUAL.

05:46.113 --> 05:48.048
- OKAY, WHAT EXACTLY
DOES THAT MEAN?

05:48.081 --> 05:52.753
- MEANS THAT, WELL,
I WAS BORN SEXUAL LIKE YOU GUYS,

05:52.786 --> 05:55.989
AND THEN I JUST--
I SORT OF...

05:56.023 --> 05:58.559
- THAT MAKES SENSE.
- SO YOU--AND YOU JUST--SEE?

05:58.592 --> 06:00.761
HE CAME UP HERE, LIKE, ABOVE US.
- YEAH, ABOVE US.

06:00.794 --> 06:04.565
- AND I GOT TO TELL YOU GUYS,
I'M EXCITED.

06:04.598 --> 06:06.366
BACK WHEN I WAS SEXUAL,
IT WAS HARD

06:06.400 --> 06:08.669
TO EVEN GET
THROUGH A MAGAZINE.

06:08.702 --> 06:10.671
OUR CULTURE IS JUST CONSTANTLY

06:10.704 --> 06:12.506
ASSAULTING US
WITH ATTRACTIVE PEOPLE.

06:12.540 --> 06:15.576
- YEAH.
- THANKS, CULTURE. MM.

06:15.609 --> 06:17.010

06:23.984 --> 06:25.118
I DIDN'T KNOW THAT ABOUT YOU.
- WHAT?

06:25.152 --> 06:26.554
- ARE YOU GONNA CHANGE
YOUR NAME?

06:26.587 --> 06:27.721
- OH, NO,
HE DIDN'T SAY TRANSSEXUAL.

06:27.755 --> 06:29.857
HE SAID TRANSCENDUAL.
- HMM.

06:29.890 --> 06:32.092
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT IS,
BUT THAT'S COOL TOO, MAN.

06:32.125 --> 06:33.627
I GOT MAD RESPECT
FOR SELF-IDENTIFICATION.

06:33.661 --> 06:34.962
- WHAT ARE YOU GUYS DOING HERE?

06:34.995 --> 06:36.296
- A WITNESS INTERVIEW
FOR A HIT-AND-RUN.

06:36.329 --> 06:38.198
WHAT ARE YOU GUYS UP TO?

06:38.231 --> 06:41.368
- WE GOT FREE LIFETIME PASSES
TO THE BIG GYM IN LINCOLN PARK.

06:41.401 --> 06:42.903
- THE FANCY GYM?
- YEAH.

06:42.936 --> 06:44.738
- NO WAY!

06:44.772 --> 06:46.139
MICHELLE OBAMA GOES TO THAT GYM.

06:46.173 --> 06:47.608
- MM-HMM, HER BODY IS
* FINE

06:47.641 --> 06:49.376
- I HAVE BEEN WANTING
TO GO THERE FOREVER,

06:49.409 --> 06:51.645
BUT IT'S JUST
SO GODDAMN EXPENSIVE, SO--

06:51.679 --> 06:52.980
- I KNOW.
IT SUCKS.

06:53.013 --> 06:54.715
AND OBVIOUSLY
I'D LOVE TO WORK OUT

06:54.748 --> 06:56.149
WITH MY BEAUTIFUL GIRLFRIEND
NEXT TO ME THE WHOLE TIME,

06:56.183 --> 06:57.651
BUT WE ONLY GOT
THESE THREE PASSES,

06:57.685 --> 06:59.219
AND LIKE YOU SAID,
IT'S CRAZY EXPENSIVE.

06:59.252 --> 07:01.388
SO IT'S JUST
ONE OF THOSE THINGS, I GUESS.

07:01.421 --> 07:02.590
TOUGH BREAK.

07:02.623 --> 07:03.991
- SHE CAN HAVE MINE.
- HMM?

07:04.024 --> 07:05.626
- YEAH, I MEAN,
I DON'T NEED IT ANYMORE

07:05.659 --> 07:07.461
NOW THAT I'M TRANSCENDUAL
AND I DON'T SEE HOTNESS.

07:07.495 --> 07:10.263
- DO YOU MIND EXPLAINING
THIS WHOLE TRANSCENDUAL THING?

07:10.297 --> 07:11.632
- YO, T,
DON'T ASK TOO MANY QUESTIONS.

07:11.665 --> 07:14.101
YOU MAY SAY SOMETHING
OFFENSIVE OR STUPID.

07:14.134 --> 07:17.004
- WHATEVER.
UH, FANCY GYM--

07:17.037 --> 07:18.506
LET'S GO TONIGHT
AFTER WORK, HUH?

07:18.539 --> 07:19.840
- GREAT.
- GREAT.

07:19.873 --> 07:21.074
OKAY, WELL, WE HAVE TO GO.

07:21.108 --> 07:22.510
BUT THANK YOU, BRIAN.

07:22.543 --> 07:23.977
- BRIAN--
- I SUPPORT YOU.

07:24.011 --> 07:25.579
- THANK YOU, BUDDY.
THAT MEANS EVERYTHING.

07:25.613 --> 07:27.848
- YEAH, YOU'RE EVERYTHING.

07:27.881 --> 07:29.416
- SOLVING PROBLEMS.

07:29.449 --> 07:30.651
- SO CLOSE.

07:30.684 --> 07:31.685
JUST SAW IT AND JUST SMASHED IT.

07:31.719 --> 07:33.186
JUST SMASHED IT.

07:33.220 --> 07:34.922
- DID YOU HEAR ANYTHING
I SAID UP THERE?

07:34.955 --> 07:36.690
- OH, WHAT A DAY.
WE'RE OFF TO A GOOD START.

07:36.724 --> 07:37.858
- WE'RE OFF TO A SH---Y START.
- HERE WE GO.

07:37.891 --> 07:38.959
HERE WE GO.
- HE'S HOPPING.

07:44.297 --> 07:46.266
- YOU KNOW HOW YOU SAID
WE COULD NEVER REALLY BE

07:46.299 --> 07:48.435
BOYFRIEND-GIRLFRIEND BECAUSE
YOU'RE ASEXUAL AND I'M NOT,

07:48.468 --> 07:50.671
AND IT WOULDN'T WORK OUT
IN THE LONG TERM

07:50.704 --> 07:53.641
BECAUSE EVENTUALLY ONE
OR BOTH OF US WOULD GET HURT?

07:53.674 --> 07:55.976
- YEAH, I REMEMBER
HAVING THAT CONVERSATION

07:56.009 --> 07:57.377
SEVERAL HUNDRED TIMES.

07:57.410 --> 08:00.180
- WELL, I HAVE
SOME PRETTY BIG NEWS.

08:00.213 --> 08:03.517
I HAVE TRANSCENDED MY SEXUALITY.

08:03.551 --> 08:05.953
- OKAY.

08:05.986 --> 08:07.555
SO YOU THINK THAT YOU ARE NEVER
GONNA WANT TO HAVE SEX AGAIN?

08:07.588 --> 08:09.857
- YEP.

08:09.890 --> 08:11.659
- THAT IT'S NOT SOMETHING YOU'RE
EVER GONNA BE THINKING ABOUT?

08:11.692 --> 08:13.561
- CORRECT.

08:13.594 --> 08:14.928
- GREAT.

08:17.765 --> 08:19.633
STRIP CLUB.

08:19.667 --> 08:21.168
WE'RE GOING TO THE STRIP CLUB.
WHO'S IN?

08:21.201 --> 08:23.036
- CAN'T, BANNED.
CITYWIDE.

08:23.070 --> 08:24.705
ALSO IN SKOKIE.

08:24.738 --> 08:25.973
DO NOT ASK.
- GIRLFRIEND.

08:26.006 --> 08:26.974
- GAY.
- LAME.

08:27.007 --> 08:28.742
CASH?
- NO, THANK YOU.

08:28.776 --> 08:32.079
STRIP CLUBS ARE FOR YOUNG MEN
WHO LACK IMAGINATION.

08:32.112 --> 08:34.414
MY AGE, I CAN RUB UP
AGAINST A COOL BREEZE

08:34.447 --> 08:35.816
AND GET EXCITED.

08:35.849 --> 08:37.585
THE CRACK OF DAWN
TURNS ME ON, BABY.

08:37.618 --> 08:39.920
[laughs]

08:39.953 --> 08:43.423
OR SOMETIMES JUST A PERFECTLY
RIPE TOMATO WILL DO THE TRICK.

08:43.456 --> 08:46.193
NOW THE WHOLE WORLD
IS MY STRIP CLUB.

08:46.226 --> 08:47.327
- DON'T LOOK AT ME.
I HATE STRIP CLUBS.

08:47.360 --> 08:48.996
- OH, I HEAR THAT.
THEY BUM ME OUT.

08:49.029 --> 08:51.932
ALL THEM SINGLE MOMS
DANCING TO FEED THEIR KIDS.

08:51.965 --> 08:54.067
EVERY TIME I'VE GONE, I END UP
DROPPING MORE BILLS IN G-STRINGS

08:54.101 --> 08:56.036
THAN THE STRAIGHT MEN.

08:56.069 --> 08:57.705
I'D PUT SCHOOL SUPPLIES IN THERE
TOO IF THERE WAS ROOM.

08:57.738 --> 09:00.708
- NO, IT'S NOT THAT
THEY BUM ME OUT.

09:00.741 --> 09:04.778
AH, IT'S JUST--WELL,
I'M KIND OF A STRIPPER MAGNET.

09:04.812 --> 09:06.747
- EXPLAIN.

09:06.780 --> 09:07.948
- IN DETAIL.

09:07.981 --> 09:08.916
- I WISH I COULD.

09:08.949 --> 09:11.118
THERE IS JUST SOMETHING ABOUT ME

09:11.151 --> 09:13.386
THAT MAKES STRIPPERS WANT TO
START UNLOADING THEIR PROBLEMS.

09:13.420 --> 09:16.123
AND TRUST ME,
THESE GIRLS HAVE PROBLEMS.

09:16.156 --> 09:19.226
SO IT'S NOT ALL GLITTER
AND GLAMOUR LIKE YOU THINK.

09:19.259 --> 09:21.094
- LOOKS LIKE IT'S JUST
YOU AND ME, KID.

09:28.902 --> 09:30.237
- CAN'T BELIEVE
THERESA'S COMING.

09:30.270 --> 09:31.805
THIS WAS GONNA BE
OUR SPECIAL PLACE.

09:31.839 --> 09:33.807
IT'S PERFECT.
- I KNOW.

09:33.841 --> 09:35.743
IT'S LIKE A GAY BAR AND
A STRAIGHT BAR ROLLED INTO ONE,

09:35.776 --> 09:37.310
EXCEPT EVERYBODY'S WEARING

09:37.344 --> 09:38.879
TIGHTER CLOTHES
AND LESS OF THEM.

09:38.912 --> 09:40.313
- TAKE ALL THE FUN OUT OF IT.

09:40.347 --> 09:42.415
NOW I GOT TO WORRY
ABOUT ALL THESE SHALLOW SCUMBAGS

09:42.449 --> 09:44.084
CHECKING OUT MY GIRL--
OH, MY GOD.

09:44.117 --> 09:46.086
CHECK OUT PINK SHORTS.

09:46.119 --> 09:48.088
THAT IS A ROCK-SOLID TEN.

09:48.121 --> 09:49.589
- MAYBE SHE'S A TEN
ON THE STREET,

09:49.623 --> 09:50.824
BUT IN HERE,
THAT GIRL'S A SEVEN AT BEST.

09:50.858 --> 09:52.392
- WHAT?

09:52.425 --> 09:54.427
IF THAT'S A SEVEN,
SHOW ME A DIME.

09:54.461 --> 09:56.797
- THAT ANGEL RIGHT OVER THERE
DOING LEG LIFTS.

09:56.830 --> 09:57.965
LIFTING MY SPIRITS.

09:57.998 --> 09:59.833
HE'S A TEN.
- THAT GUY?

09:59.867 --> 10:01.601
I MEAN, HIS BODY, SURE,
BUT HIS FACE IS KIND OF JOWLY

10:01.635 --> 10:02.770
IS ALL I'M SAYING.

10:02.803 --> 10:03.937
- HE HAS A FACE?

10:03.971 --> 10:04.938
- OH, MY GOD.

10:04.972 --> 10:06.273
OH, MY GOD.

10:06.306 --> 10:07.507
PURPLE TOP.

10:07.540 --> 10:09.743
HER BOOBS ARE, UM,

10:09.777 --> 10:12.345
I'M GONNA USE THE WORD BUOYANT.
- OOH, NICE WORD CHOICE.

10:12.379 --> 10:13.814
- THANK YOU. YOU LIKE IT?
- YES.

10:13.847 --> 10:14.982
- WANT TO HEAR ANOTHER ONE?
- PLEASE.

10:15.015 --> 10:16.283
- BLACK SHORTS, BLACK TOP.

10:16.316 --> 10:17.851
HER ASS?
- HIT ME.

10:17.885 --> 10:19.853
- TIDY.
- [laughs]

10:19.887 --> 10:21.689
OOH, WHAT ABOUT HER ASS?

10:21.722 --> 10:23.123
- OKAY, WELL, HER--

10:23.156 --> 10:25.092
DO YOU KNOW LATIN? 'CAUSE--
- HEY, GUYS.

10:25.125 --> 10:26.960
- WHOA, HEY, THERESA.
- HEY.

10:26.994 --> 10:28.495
- WHAT'S GOING ON?

10:28.528 --> 10:29.697
HERE SHE IS.

10:29.730 --> 10:31.198
NOW THE FUN CAN START.
- YEAH.

10:31.231 --> 10:34.034
- YOU LOOK SO PRETTY TODAY.
SO PRETTY.

10:34.067 --> 10:37.771
- OH, THANK YOU.
- YEAH.

10:37.805 --> 10:40.007
- WAY TO STROLL, GUYS.

10:40.040 --> 10:41.008
- [laughs] YEAH.

10:41.041 --> 10:43.443
- COME ON!
[laughs]

10:43.476 --> 10:45.212
OH, MY GOD, LOOK AT THE GIRL
IN THE PURPLE TOP.

10:45.245 --> 10:48.615
- WHAT? WHERE?
- THE ONE WITH THE PERKY BOOBS.

10:48.648 --> 10:50.317
CHECK OUT HER TRICEPS.

10:50.350 --> 10:52.452
I COULD DO A HUNDRED DIPS A DAY

10:52.485 --> 10:54.955
AND NEVER HAVE TRICEPS
LIKE THAT.

10:54.988 --> 10:56.323
- YOU'VE GOT AMAZING TRICEPS.

10:56.356 --> 10:57.858
DOESN'T SHE, HANK?
- UH-HUH.

10:57.891 --> 10:59.827
- AND HER ASS.
[whistles]

10:59.860 --> 11:01.995
SHE MUST DO SQUATS IN HER SLEEP.

11:02.029 --> 11:03.530
SHE'S GORGEOUS.

11:03.563 --> 11:04.197
- NO ONE'S HOTTER
THAN YOU, BABY.

11:04.231 --> 11:05.899
- STOP COMPLIMENTING ME.

11:05.933 --> 11:07.835
IT'S WEIRD.

11:07.868 --> 11:09.903
- OH, EXCUSE ME.

11:09.937 --> 11:11.571
I JUST REMEMBERED
THERE'S A STEAM ROOM

11:11.604 --> 11:14.141
THAT I'M HOPING
INVOLVES SOME VERY CLEAR STEAM.

11:14.174 --> 11:15.242
- HEY.

11:15.275 --> 11:16.744
- WHAT?
- CHECK OUT THAT GIRL.

11:16.777 --> 11:18.245
SHE'S CUT.

11:18.278 --> 11:20.981
THERE ARE NO WOMEN LIKE THAT
AT THE COP GYM.

11:21.014 --> 11:23.516
IT'S INSPIRING.

11:23.550 --> 11:26.586
MAKES ME WANT TO UP
MY WORKOUT GAME, YOU KNOW?

11:26.619 --> 11:29.656
I'M GONNA COME HERE EVERY NIGHT.
- OH, COOL.

11:29.689 --> 11:31.391
THAT'S SO COOL.

11:31.424 --> 11:32.926
WHAT ABOUT THAT BOOK CLUB--

11:32.960 --> 11:34.661
- HONEY, WHO DO YOU THINK
HAS BETTER MUSCLE TONE?

11:34.694 --> 11:36.063
YELLOW SNEAKERS OR SIDE BRAID?

11:36.096 --> 11:37.497
- I'M SURE I HAVE NO IDEA.

11:37.530 --> 11:39.266
- OH, YOU CAN'T SEE THOSE GIRLS
EITHER?

11:39.299 --> 11:40.100
- I DON'T COME TO THE GYM
TO CHECK OUT WOMEN.

11:40.133 --> 11:41.769
- NEITHER DO I.

11:41.802 --> 11:43.670
DOESN'T HURT TO LOOK
WHILE I'M HERE.

11:43.703 --> 11:45.038
- YOU DON'T CHECK OUT THE GUYS?

11:45.072 --> 11:46.006
- NO, THAT'S WHAT
I GO TO WHOLE FOODS FOR.

11:46.039 --> 11:47.540
- WHAT?

11:47.574 --> 11:50.277
- COME ON,
YELLOW SNEAKERS, SIDE BRAID, GO.

11:50.310 --> 11:51.945
- I'M NOT ANSWERING THIS.

11:51.979 --> 11:55.048
- YOU ARE REALLY TAKING THE FUN
OUT OF FANCY GYM, YOU KNOW THAT?

11:55.082 --> 11:56.716
- WH--

11:56.750 --> 11:58.185
- IT'S YELLOW SNEAKERS,
BY THE WAY.

11:58.218 --> 12:01.088
[R&B music]

12:01.121 --> 12:04.391
*

12:04.424 --> 12:05.692
- HOW IS THIS EVEN LEGAL?

12:05.725 --> 12:07.094
- THEY'RE NOT EVEN TOPLESS,
BRIAN.

12:07.127 --> 12:09.129
- NOT THAT.
$10 FOR A WATER.

12:09.162 --> 12:10.964
$3 FOR A LEMON SLICE.

12:10.998 --> 12:12.966
THIS IS--[scoffs]
THIS IS ROBBERY.

12:13.000 --> 12:15.102
- EXCUSE ME,
WE NEED A STRIPPER OVER HERE.

12:15.135 --> 12:17.204
- OH, AND SURE,
THEY GIVE YOU FREE PEANUTS

12:17.237 --> 12:18.906
BECAUSE THEY WANT YOU
TO BUY THE WATER.

12:18.939 --> 12:20.073
I KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING.

12:20.107 --> 12:22.910
I'M NOT GONNA LET THEM WIN.

12:22.943 --> 12:25.745
- MY FRIEND HERE
WILL HAVE ONE LAP DANCE, PLEASE.

12:25.779 --> 12:28.281
- AWESOME.

12:28.315 --> 12:30.150
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?
- BRIAN.

12:30.183 --> 12:32.886
EXCUSE ME, MISS,
BUT I JUST HAVE TO ASK.

12:32.920 --> 12:34.988
HOW MUCH IS A BURGER HERE?
- I DON'T KNOW.

12:35.022 --> 12:37.991
I DON'T EAT HERE.

12:38.025 --> 12:39.793
- SHE WANTS YOU TO PUT MONEY
IN THERE.

12:39.827 --> 12:41.594
- OH, YEAH.
I ONLY HAVE A 20.

12:41.628 --> 12:44.497
DO YOU HAPPEN TO HAVE
ANY CHANGE OR...

12:44.531 --> 12:45.933
- I'M DANCING PRETTY HARD
FOR YOU HERE.

12:45.966 --> 12:47.267
I COULD REALLY USE
SOME ENCOURAGEMENT.

12:47.300 --> 12:49.136
- OKAY.

12:49.169 --> 12:53.106
ALL RIGHT.
UH...

12:53.140 --> 12:55.308
- WHAT THE HELL, MAN?
- OKAY, FORGET HIM.

12:55.342 --> 12:58.812
NEW PLAN.
DO ME.

12:58.846 --> 13:00.013
MM.

13:00.047 --> 13:01.181
OH, YEAH.

13:01.214 --> 13:02.983
HOW ABOUT THIS, BRIAN?
HUH?

13:03.016 --> 13:05.352
A LITTLE GIRL-ON-GIRL ACTION?

13:05.385 --> 13:07.254
IS THIS DOING ANYTHING FOR YOU?

13:07.287 --> 13:09.356
- OH, EXCUSE ME, MISS,

13:09.389 --> 13:11.424
BUT IS HER DANCE GONNA BE EXTRA?

13:11.458 --> 13:13.126
- YEAH.
TWO LAP DANCES, TWO PEOPLE.

13:13.160 --> 13:18.465
THAT'S 80 BUCKS.
- 80 DOLL--[coughs]

13:18.498 --> 13:20.467
- HEY, THIS GUY NEEDS A WATER.

13:20.500 --> 13:22.302
- [coughing]
NO, NO, NO!

13:22.335 --> 13:23.203
I'M FINE.
- OKAY.

13:23.236 --> 13:25.906
- NO WATER.
[coughs]

13:31.578 --> 13:32.212
- I MEAN, THAT GIRL HAS
THE BEST THIGHS I'VE SEEN

13:32.245 --> 13:33.813
SINCE SERENA WILLIAMS.

13:33.847 --> 13:36.483
POWERFUL BUT LEAN.
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

13:36.516 --> 13:38.318
- I THINK SHE HAS NICE THIGHS.

13:38.351 --> 13:42.055
I BET SHE EVEN HAS A NICE BRAIN.
- OH, PLEASE.

13:42.089 --> 13:43.656
- I'M SORRY, I'M NOT TALKING
ABOUT ANOTHER WOMAN'S THIGHS

13:43.690 --> 13:44.958
WITH MY GIRLFRIEND--
IT'S WEIRD.

13:44.992 --> 13:46.894
- OH, RIGHT,
BUT IT WOULD BE LESS WEIRD

13:46.927 --> 13:49.029
IF YOU CAME TO THE GYM
AND CHECKED OUT GIRLS WITH HANK?

13:49.062 --> 13:50.730
- YEAH, HONESTLY, IT WOULD BE.

13:50.763 --> 13:52.199
THERE ARE CERTAIN THINGS
YOU JUST DON'T TALK ABOUT

13:52.232 --> 13:53.000
WITH THE PERSON
YOU'RE IN A RELATIONSHIP WITH.

13:53.033 --> 13:54.734
- OH, COME ON.

13:54.767 --> 13:56.636
- I'M SORRY.
IT'S A SLIPPERY SLOPE.

13:56.669 --> 13:58.005
I CERTAINLY DON'T WANT TO KNOW
WHAT YOU THINK ABOUT OTHER GUYS.

13:58.038 --> 14:00.874
- THAT IS
BECAUSE YOU FEEL THREATENED.

14:00.908 --> 14:03.143
[laughs]
- YEAH, AND THAT'S NORMAL.

14:03.176 --> 14:04.244
HOW COME YOU
DON'T FEEL THREATENED

14:04.277 --> 14:05.578
ABOUT ME
LOOKING AT OTHER WOMEN?

14:05.612 --> 14:06.980
- 'CAUSE AT THE END
OF THE DAY,

14:07.014 --> 14:10.417
I KNOW
YOU'RE COMING HOME WITH ME.

14:10.450 --> 14:12.519
TELL ME THAT GIRL
DOESN'T HAVE AMAZING ABS.

14:12.552 --> 14:14.354
- SLIPPERY SLOPE, BABY.

14:14.387 --> 14:15.855
IT'S A SLIPPERY SLOPE.
- WE HAVE TO LEAVE.

14:15.889 --> 14:18.658
WE HAVE TO LEAVE RIGHT NOW.
- WHY?

14:18.691 --> 14:21.261
- I WAS IN THE STEAM ROOM,
AND IT WAS GREAT AT FIRST.

14:21.294 --> 14:23.063
I WAS CHECKING OUT
ALL THE HOT GUYS.

14:23.096 --> 14:25.598
ALL THE HOT GUYS WERE CHECKING
OUT ALL THE OTHER HOT GUYS.

14:25.632 --> 14:28.902
AND THEN I NOTICED
NO ONE WAS CHECKING OUT ME.

14:28.936 --> 14:30.037
NO ONE HAS CHECKED ME OUT
SINCE I STEPPED FOOT

14:30.070 --> 14:32.205
IN THIS GYM, JOHNNY.

14:32.239 --> 14:33.406
ON THE STREETS OF CHICAGO, I'M
A TALL, HANDSOME DRINK OF WATER.

14:33.440 --> 14:34.741
IN HERE, I'M JUST TALL.

14:34.774 --> 14:37.077
- I AM SURE
SOMEONE HAS CHECKED YOU OUT.

14:37.110 --> 14:38.578
- I DON'T KNOW.

14:38.611 --> 14:39.746
- I'M SURE
WE HAVE ALL BEEN CHECKED OUT.

14:39.779 --> 14:41.214
- I DON'T KNOW.
LOOK AROUND.

14:41.248 --> 14:44.884
THIS PLACE IS
A TOTAL MEAT MARKET.

14:44.918 --> 14:46.386
AND WE JUST VEGETABLES.

14:46.419 --> 14:48.188
- I ALWAYS GET CHECKED OUT
AT THE COP GYM,

14:48.221 --> 14:49.889
BY MEN AND WOMEN.
- YEAH, THAT'S THE COP GYM.

14:49.923 --> 14:51.691
LOOK AROUND.
THIS IS A WHOLE OTHER LEVEL.

14:51.724 --> 14:53.626
- WHAT IS THE MATTER
WITH YOU TWO?

14:53.660 --> 14:55.095
WHY CAN'T YOU JUST
ENJOY THE VIEW?

14:55.128 --> 14:57.130
WHY DO YOU HAVE TO KNOW
THAT YOU'RE ON THE MENU?

14:57.164 --> 14:59.232
- BECAUSE THE GYM IS WHERE I GO
TO--TO FEEL GOOD ABOUT MYSELF.

14:59.266 --> 15:01.134
- RIGHT, IT'S A WHOLE BOOST.

15:01.168 --> 15:02.135
- YOU WANT TO FEEL GOOD
ABOUT YOURSELF,

15:02.169 --> 15:03.803
GO TO NAVY PIER OR THE ZOO.

15:03.836 --> 15:05.205
IT'S A BUNCH OF FAT PEOPLE
EATING FUNNEL CAKES.

15:05.238 --> 15:07.140
- NOT FOR NOTHING,

15:07.174 --> 15:09.242
EVEN STRAIGHT GIRLS CHECK ME OUT
AT THE GYM SOMETIMES.

15:09.276 --> 15:11.478
- YOU KNOW WHAT?

15:11.511 --> 15:13.480
IT'S BECAUSE JOHN AND I HAVE
BEEN TOGETHER THE WHOLE TIME.

15:13.513 --> 15:14.982
- OKAY.
- OH.

15:15.015 --> 15:16.149
AM I BRINGING DOWN
YOUR AVERAGE?

15:16.183 --> 15:18.085
- GIVE ME SOME SPACE, BABE.
GOD.

15:18.118 --> 15:21.989
- GO, SOAR.

15:22.022 --> 15:26.159
- OH, OFF THE SHOULDER, OKAY.

15:26.193 --> 15:28.295
- OH, YEAH.
THERE SHE GOES.

15:28.328 --> 15:29.963
- OH.
- SHE MOVED DOWN.

15:29.997 --> 15:32.765
OH, SHE'S MOONING THE GUY
NEXT TO HER.

15:32.799 --> 15:34.501
SHE'S BACKING THE MOON
INTO HIS FACE.

15:34.534 --> 15:35.969
- OKAY, JUST--

15:36.003 --> 15:38.071
- OH, IS THAT A YAWN?
- OOH.

15:38.105 --> 15:39.172
- HE LOOKED AT HER ASS
AND YAWNED.

15:39.206 --> 15:42.509
- OH, GIRL, YOU KNOW THAT HURT.

15:42.542 --> 15:44.244
- OH, SHE'S NOT GIVING UP,
THOUGH, IS SHE?

15:44.277 --> 15:45.945
- OOH, GIRL.

15:49.149 --> 15:53.186
- OH, I THINK SHE MIGHT HAVE
PULLED SOMETHING THERE.

15:53.220 --> 15:55.755
SHE'S GONNA
GO FOR THE DUAL CABLE CROSS.

15:55.788 --> 15:56.990
- THAT'S RIGHT.
SHAKE IT OFF, GIRL.

15:57.024 --> 15:58.258
SHAKE IT OFF. YOU CAN DO IT.
- YEAH.

15:58.291 --> 15:59.859
THIS IS
A CLASSICALLY SEXY MACHINE.

15:59.892 --> 16:02.595
DUDE--OH, HERE COMES A GUY--
AND NOTHING.

16:02.629 --> 16:04.364
- OH.
- SWING AND A MISS.

16:04.397 --> 16:06.199
HEY, SWEETIE,
LET'S GO, HONEY.

16:06.233 --> 16:07.534
- GIVE ME A SECOND!
- NOPE, SWEETIE.

16:07.567 --> 16:08.468
LET'S GO.

16:08.501 --> 16:10.370
- NO, JUST GIVE ME A MINUTE.

16:10.403 --> 16:11.971
- JUST LET HER WORK THROUGH IT.
I'LL BUY YOU A SHOT.

16:12.005 --> 16:13.506
- ONE OF THOSE
WHEATGRASS THINGS?

16:13.540 --> 16:15.042
- HELL, NO.
TEQUILA, IT'S A BAR NEXT DOOR.

16:15.075 --> 16:16.476
- OH, MAYBE THAT CAN BE
OUR SPECIAL PLACE.

16:16.509 --> 16:18.011
YEAH, YEAH, LET'S DO IT.
- LET'S GO. YES.

16:18.045 --> 16:19.679
- SCREW FANCY GYM.

16:22.149 --> 16:23.483
- AHH.

16:23.516 --> 16:25.452
NOTHING TASTES AS GOOD
AS FREE.

16:25.485 --> 16:29.022
DO YOU REALIZE THAT
OUR WHOLE MEAL IS HALF THE PRICE

16:29.056 --> 16:31.124
OF ONE STRIPPER WATER
WITH LEMON?

16:31.158 --> 16:33.293
- COOL.

16:33.326 --> 16:34.794
- WHAT'S WRONG, V.D.?

16:34.827 --> 16:36.563
- BRIAN, I TOLD YOU,
THAT IS A TERRIBLE NICKNAME.

16:36.596 --> 16:38.565
- SORRY, VOO-VOO.

16:38.598 --> 16:40.233
- YOU DO KNOW THAT VOODOO
IS ALREADY A NICKNAME, RIGHT?

16:40.267 --> 16:42.001
- I THOUGHT YOU'D BE HAPPIER.

16:42.035 --> 16:44.237
NOW THAT I'VE PROVEN
THAT I'M NOT SEXUAL ANYMORE,

16:44.271 --> 16:46.005
WE CAN OFFICIALLY BE
BOYFRIEND-GIRLFRIEND.

16:46.039 --> 16:47.674
- BRIAN,
YOU DIDN'T PROVE ANYTHING.

16:47.707 --> 16:49.676
- I DIDN'T GET TURNED ON
AT THE STRIP CLUB.

16:49.709 --> 16:51.511
- 'CAUSE YOU'RE CHEAP,
NOT 'CAUSE YOU'RE ASEXUAL.

16:51.544 --> 16:53.313
- TRANSCENDUAL.

16:53.346 --> 16:55.215
- THIS SUCKS.

16:55.248 --> 16:57.050
I LIKE YOU A LOT.

16:57.084 --> 16:58.918
AND YOU CLEARLY LIKE ME ENOUGH
TO BELIEVE

16:58.951 --> 17:01.020
THAT YOU COULD ACTUALLY
CHANGE SOMETHING VERY MAJOR

17:01.054 --> 17:02.255
ABOUT YOURSELF FOR ME.

17:02.289 --> 17:04.091
- I KNOW
THAT YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME,

17:04.124 --> 17:06.226
BUT I THINK I REALLY DID CHANGE.

17:06.259 --> 17:08.161
- OKAY,

17:08.195 --> 17:10.163
I DIDN'T WANT TO DO THIS.

17:10.197 --> 17:12.232
AND KNOW THAT THIS MEANS
ABSOLUTELY NOTHING FOR ME,

17:12.265 --> 17:14.101
BUT...

17:17.304 --> 17:20.207
HOW YOU FEELING OVER THERE?

17:20.240 --> 17:21.574
- FEELING PRETTY TRANSCENDUAL.

17:25.245 --> 17:28.581
- WHAT'S YOUR PHONE NUMBER?

17:28.615 --> 17:33.553
- UM, 312-4...
- NO.

17:33.586 --> 17:35.588
- 6--YOU KNOW,

17:35.622 --> 17:39.058
THIS REALLY ISN'T FAIR
BECAUSE CELLULAR TECHNOLOGY

17:39.092 --> 17:40.527
HAS MADE REMEMBERING
PHONE NUMBERS

17:40.560 --> 17:43.096
A SKILL OF THE PAST.

17:45.832 --> 17:47.300
THIS MEAN
THAT WE'RE BREAKING UP?

17:47.334 --> 17:48.768
- IT MEANS WE'RE NOT GOING
DOWN THE ROAD

17:48.801 --> 17:50.270
WHERE WE BREAK UP EVENTUALLY.

17:50.303 --> 17:52.305
- SO WE CAN'T HANG OUT
AND TALK ANYMORE?

17:52.339 --> 17:53.940
- WE CAN STILL HANG OUT
AND TALK.

17:53.973 --> 17:56.409
- BUT WE CAN'T GO TO MOVIES
TOGETHER ANYMORE?

17:56.443 --> 17:58.077
- I MEAN, I STILL LIKE MOVIES.

17:58.111 --> 18:01.080
- BUT WE CAN'T NOT HAVE SEX
AFTER THE MOVIE ANYMORE?

18:01.114 --> 18:02.815
- WE WILL STILL
NOT BE HAVING SEX.

18:02.849 --> 18:05.485
- SO WHAT, I'M JUST
SUPPOSED TO BE YOUR FRIEND

18:05.518 --> 18:08.488
AND DO ALL THE THINGS
THAT WE LOVE TO DO TOGETHER?

18:08.521 --> 18:10.590
INSTEAD OF BEING CELIBATE
WITH YOU,

18:10.623 --> 18:13.293
I'M JUST SUPPOSED TO GO OFF
AND HAVE SEX WITH OTHER WOMEN?

18:13.326 --> 18:15.762
- YEAH,
THAT'S THE BASIC SUMMARY.

18:15.795 --> 18:18.331
- OH.
- HERE'S THE CHECK.

18:18.365 --> 18:20.933
AND A TWO-FOR-ONE COUPON
FOR THE COFFEES.

18:20.967 --> 18:22.769
I'M NOT SUPPOSED
TO GIVE THEM OUT,

18:22.802 --> 18:25.505
BUT I JUST CAN'T STAND TO SEE
ANYBODY MISS OUT ON A BARGAIN.

18:25.538 --> 18:27.807
- THANK YOU.
I'M THE SAME WAY.

18:27.840 --> 18:30.277
- JUST, UM, DON'T TELL MY BOSS.

18:35.182 --> 18:38.285
- SORRY.
- DON'T BE, SHE'S CUTE.

18:38.318 --> 18:39.486
YOU SHOULD GO ASK
FOR HER NUMBER.

18:39.519 --> 18:41.087
- REALLY?
- YEAH.

18:41.120 --> 18:42.655
AND SHE SEEMS LIKE A CHEAP DATE.

18:42.689 --> 18:46.493
- I JUST FEEL REALLY WEIRD, VOO.

18:46.526 --> 18:49.796
I'LL JUST GO PAY.

18:49.829 --> 18:54.133
AND MAYBE I WILL THANK HER
FOR THE COUPON IF THAT IS OKAY.

18:54.167 --> 18:57.003
- YEAH, OF COURSE.
GO.

19:01.341 --> 19:02.709
- HEY, THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR THIS.

19:02.742 --> 19:05.312
[indistinct chatter]

19:11.418 --> 19:13.320
20 SHOULD DO IT.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

19:19.058 --> 19:21.160
- OH, IT IS NICE
TO BE TENS AGAIN.

19:21.194 --> 19:23.496
- MAYBE A TEN
OUT IN THE REGULAR WORLD.

19:23.530 --> 19:26.299
HERE WE ARE SOLID 12s.
- MM.

19:26.333 --> 19:27.500
LET'S TAKE A LAP.

19:27.534 --> 19:29.702
- YEAH.
- [sighs]

19:29.736 --> 19:31.404
JOHNNY'S MISSING OUT.

19:31.438 --> 19:33.306
I CAN'T BELIEVE HE'S STILL GOING
TO THAT SUPERFICIAL GYM.

19:33.340 --> 19:34.874
- [laughs]
I KNOW.

19:34.907 --> 19:37.710
I'M SO GLAD
THAT WE GAVE OUR PASSES AWAY.

19:39.846 --> 19:41.248
SHOULD WE GET A FUNNEL CAKE?

19:41.281 --> 19:43.216
- I THINK WE EARNED IT.

19:45.418 --> 19:48.388
- ONE. TWO.

19:48.421 --> 19:50.690
- WELL, I CAN DEFINITELY SEE
HOTNESS AGAIN.

19:50.723 --> 19:52.659
- WELCOME BACK, BRIAN.
SORRY ABOUT VOODOO, THOUGH.

19:52.692 --> 19:55.428
- I THINK IT'LL BE A WHILE
BEFORE I'M READY TO LOVE AGAIN,

19:55.462 --> 19:56.563
BUT I AM READY TO LOOK AGAIN.

19:56.596 --> 19:58.731
- HEY, GUYS.
- HEY.

19:58.765 --> 20:00.367
- LANCE,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

20:00.400 --> 20:01.501
YOU HAVE A SEVERE GROIN TEAR.

20:01.534 --> 20:03.336
YOU SHOULD NOT BE WORKING OUT.

20:03.370 --> 20:04.871
- PEOPLE HAVE BEEN
TELLING ME "NO" MY WHOLE LIFE.

20:04.904 --> 20:06.506
IT FUELS ME.
I THRIVE ON IT.

20:06.539 --> 20:07.707
- AND IT SHOWS, MAN.

20:07.740 --> 20:10.009
YOU SWOLL AS SH--.

20:10.042 --> 20:12.512
DANG.
YOUR TRAPS ARE CRAZY, BRO.

20:12.545 --> 20:15.081
THEY LOOK LIKE WATERSLIDES
DOWN TO YOUR SHOULDERS.

20:15.114 --> 20:17.584
YO, HOW YOU FIT
INTO YOUR SHIRTS, BRO?

20:17.617 --> 20:19.886
- I'VE GOT A TAILOR,
THIS OLD HUNGARIAN DUDE.

20:19.919 --> 20:22.255
USED TO FIT FRANK THOMAS.

20:22.289 --> 20:23.390
- THE BIG HURT?

20:23.423 --> 20:25.024
YO, DROP ME HIS CARD, BRO.

20:25.057 --> 20:26.125
- YOU GUYS
GONNA BE WORKING OUT HERE?

20:26.158 --> 20:27.193
- LIFETIME PASSES.

20:27.226 --> 20:28.895
- ALL RIGHT.

20:28.928 --> 20:30.297
LET ME KNOW IF YOU NEED A SPOT.

20:30.330 --> 20:32.565
[grunting]
- OH, OW, AH. LANCE?

20:32.599 --> 20:34.367
NO, LANCE, BE CAREFUL, PLEASE.

20:34.401 --> 20:36.736
- YO, CHECK OUT THAT GIRL
RIGHT THERE.

20:36.769 --> 20:37.470
- OH, THE ONE
IN THE SWEATPANTS?

20:37.504 --> 20:38.871
- OH, YEAH, MAN.

20:38.905 --> 20:40.373
I JUST WANT TO TAKE THAT GIRL

20:40.407 --> 20:41.708
TO THE FARMERS MARKET
AND PICK OUT PRODUCE.

20:41.741 --> 20:43.476
- YEAH, I CAN SEE THAT.

20:43.510 --> 20:45.445
SHE HAS THAT LOOK LIKE SHE KNOWS
EXACTLY WHAT'S IN SEASON.

20:45.478 --> 20:47.113
- OH, MAN,
I CAN TOTALLY SEE MYSELF

20:47.146 --> 20:49.148
WALKING BACK
FROM THE MARKET WITH THAT GIRL,

20:49.181 --> 20:50.783
HOLDING HANDS,

20:50.817 --> 20:53.553
BUNCHES OF KALE STICKING
OUT OF OUR REUSABLE BAGS.

20:53.586 --> 20:55.755
- THEN YOU GET HOME, AND SHE
MAKES YOU A LITTLE HOT COCOA.

20:55.788 --> 20:57.457
- OH, SHE MAKES SUCH GOOD COCOA.

20:57.490 --> 20:59.158
- YEAH,
AND THEN IT'S SNOWING OUTSIDE.

20:59.191 --> 21:00.593
IT'S A LITTLE CHILLY.
- YEAH. OH. BRR!

21:00.627 --> 21:02.094
- YOU START SNUGGLING
ON THE COUCH,

21:02.128 --> 21:03.896
AND THEN YOU JUST
BANG HER BRAINS OUT, BRO.

21:03.930 --> 21:06.299
MARSHMALLOWS EVERYWHERE, DUDE.

21:06.333 --> 21:07.834
[sighs]

21:07.867 --> 21:10.102
- ARE WE GONNA DO ANYTHING
BESIDES THE TREADMILL?

21:10.136 --> 21:12.071
- NO, MAN.
I TRIED THE WEIGHT MACHINES.

21:12.104 --> 21:13.440
THAT SH-- AIN'T CALIBRATED
RIGHT.

21:13.473 --> 21:14.441
- STEAM ROOM?

21:14.474 --> 21:15.442
- STEAM ROOM.

21:15.475 --> 21:19.245
[machines beep]

21:19.278 --> 21:20.713
- NICE, 2.4.

21:24.617 --> 21:27.487
HEY, GIRL.

21:27.520 --> 21:28.555
WHAT'S UP, BRO?
