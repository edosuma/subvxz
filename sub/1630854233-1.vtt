But our organs,
they still work the same.

just an acceleration

23:04.195 --> 23:06.396
the enhancements
of every vampire

to the condition they're in

23:08.800 --> 23:11.301
at the time of their change.

23:11.369 --> 23:14.372
Because the body
they die with…

is the body
they'll have forever.

Yeah, they were assholes

the consequences.

to tell me some story

37:31.767 --> 37:33.902

- Do you want to fight?

37:38.039 --> 37:39.841

how to live like this?

38:34.497 --> 38:36.597
- Nah.

38:36.666 --> 38:39.116
No, I had to learn that
on my own.

38:40.169 --> 38:41.736

- Well, I'm hoping

you'll teach me.

38:46.242 --> 38:47.975
- Yeah.

38:48.044 --> 38:49.243
I can do that.

38:49.312 --> 38:51.712

39:54.369 --> 39:58.171
And she will make him suffer.

40:01.242 --> 40:03.877
We summoned Maurice,

- Maurice chased us away.

40:37.312 --> 40:38.844
There was no time.

- So you just left evidence
