00:00.500 --> 00:02.860
you are considering
going into experimental physics,

00:02.860 --> 00:04.460
my door is always open.

00:04.460 --> 00:05.800
Once again, I'm sorry

00:05.800 --> 00:07.430
that the demonstration
didn't quite work out,

00:07.430 --> 00:10.030
but now we know what happens
when you accidentally spill

00:10.030 --> 00:13.600
Peach Snapple into
a helium neon laser.

00:14.660 --> 00:17.460
Short answer is... don't.

00:21.430 --> 00:24.560
And now to tell you about the
theoretical physics department

00:24.560 --> 00:26.230
is Dr. Sheldon Cooper.

00:30.500 --> 00:31.500
Dr. Cooper?

00:31.500 --> 00:33.660
SHELDON:
Forget it.

00:33.660 --> 00:35.630
Excuse me.

00:37.160 --> 00:38.800
Sheldon, we both
agreed to do this.

00:38.800 --> 00:40.030
It's a waste
of time.

00:40.030 --> 00:42.100
I might as well explain
the laws of thermodynamics

00:42.100 --> 00:43.460
to a bunch
of labradoodles.

00:45.430 --> 00:47.400
If you don't do this,

00:47.400 --> 00:49.830
I won't take you
to the comic book store.

00:52.100 --> 00:53.930
Hello.

00:57.000 --> 01:00.800
Nice work with
the laser, by the way.

01:02.060 --> 01:05.860
Looking out at your
fresh young faces,

01:05.860 --> 01:09.160
I remember when I too was
deciding my academic future

01:09.160 --> 01:12.300
as a lowly graduate student.

01:12.300 --> 01:14.760
Of course, I was 14.

01:14.760 --> 01:16.760
And I'd already achieved more
than most of you

01:16.760 --> 01:20.130
could ever hope to,
despite my 9:00 bedtime.

01:21.730 --> 01:24.360
Now, there may be one or two
of you in this room

01:24.360 --> 01:27.530
who has what it takes to succeed
in theoretical physics.

01:27.530 --> 01:29.530
Although, it's more likely
that you'll spend

01:29.530 --> 01:31.400
your scientific careers teaching
fifth graders

01:31.400 --> 01:35.030
how to make papier mache
volcanoes with baking soda lava.

01:36.460 --> 01:38.630
Oh, good God.
In short--

01:38.630 --> 01:41.460
any one who told you that you
would someday be able

01:41.460 --> 01:43.630
to make any significant
contribution to physics,

01:43.630 --> 01:46.830
played a cruel trick on you,
a cruel trick indeed.

01:48.330 --> 01:50.760
Any questions?

01:52.430 --> 01:55.800
Of course not.

01:55.800 --> 01:58.830
I weep for the future
of science.

01:58.830 --> 02:02.030
<i>Now if you'll excuse me, the
latest issue of Batman is out.</i>

02:02.800 --> 02:04.800
Come, Leonard.

02:07.560 --> 02:11.660
Laser demonstration's looking
pretty good now, huh?

02:37.160 --> 02:38.400
I love this time
of the year.

02:38.400 --> 02:39.460
The leaves are turning,

02:39.460 --> 02:41.430
there's a bracing chill
in the air.

02:41.430 --> 02:44.300
Plus there's a whole new crop
of female grad students

02:44.300 --> 02:46.330
about to put on just enough
winter weight

02:46.330 --> 02:48.500
to make them needy
and vulnerable.

02:49.960 --> 02:52.760
That's right, honey,
have another calzone.

02:52.760 --> 02:54.460
Daddy can wait.

02:56.630 --> 02:58.030
Isn't there a university policy

02:58.030 --> 02:59.600
against dating
graduate students?

02:59.600 --> 03:01.600
No, if you can talk to them,
you can ask them out.

03:01.600 --> 03:04.000
Damn, there's always a catch.

03:05.100 --> 03:07.100
Hey, guys.
Hey, Leslie.

03:07.100 --> 03:09.300
So, dumbass, I heard you made
a grad student

03:09.300 --> 03:10.630
throw up last night.

03:10.630 --> 03:13.560
The truth can indeed be
a finger down the throat

03:13.560 --> 03:15.900
of those unprepared to hear it.

03:15.900 --> 03:19.060
But why should I cater
to second-rate minds?

03:19.060 --> 03:23.030
Because first-rate minds
call you "dumbass"?

03:24.460 --> 03:26.330
Oh, yeah? Well...

03:26.330 --> 03:28.860
you're a mean person.

03:29.860 --> 03:31.260
Excuse me, Dr. Cooper,

03:31.260 --> 03:32.360
I'm Ramona Nowitzki.

03:32.360 --> 03:34.100
I was at your talk
last night.

03:34.100 --> 03:36.160
I think you're just brilliant.

03:36.160 --> 03:38.560
That is the prevailing
opinion.

03:38.560 --> 03:41.860
Oh, now I'm gonna throw up.

03:41.860 --> 03:44.430
Howard Wolowitz,
department of engineering,

03:44.430 --> 03:46.530
co-designer of the
International Space Station's

03:46.530 --> 03:49.330
Liquid Waste Disposal System.

03:50.860 --> 03:52.660
Ew.

03:55.930 --> 03:58.430
Dr. Cooper, I've read
everything you've published.

03:58.430 --> 04:00.800
I especially liked your paper
on grand unification

04:00.800 --> 04:02.200
using string-network condensates

04:02.200 --> 04:03.460
and wawondering
how you determined

04:03.460 --> 04:04.830
that three-dimensional
string-nets provided

04:04.830 --> 04:06.530
a unified picture of ferrnions

04:06.530 --> 04:07.930
and gauge bosons?

04:07.930 --> 04:12.400
Amazing, an intelligent
labradoodle.

04:12.400 --> 04:15.160
Woof.

04:16.730 --> 04:18.660
The fact is I'm quite
close to a breakthrough

04:18.660 --> 04:21.360
in showing how neutrinos emerge
from a string-net condensate.

04:21.360 --> 04:23.530
Oh, my God, that would
change the way we view

04:23.530 --> 04:24.630
the entire physical universe.

04:24.630 --> 04:27.400
It's what I do.

04:27.400 --> 04:30.630
You know, the Pishkin-Wolowitz
Liquid Waste Disposal System

04:30.630 --> 04:33.830
is turning a few
heads as well.

04:37.230 --> 04:39.830
Again, ew.

04:42.030 --> 04:43.260
You know, I'd love to hear more

04:43.260 --> 04:44.630
about how you intend
to add neutrinos.

04:44.630 --> 04:46.860
Could we get a cup
of coffee sometime?

04:46.860 --> 04:48.460
I don't drink coffee.

04:48.460 --> 04:50.500
I do. I love me a cup of joe.

04:50.500 --> 04:52.260
Well, it doesn't have
to be coffee.

04:52.260 --> 04:53.400
How about dinner?

04:53.400 --> 04:55.030
I do eat dinner.

04:55.030 --> 04:56.560
Great. I know a terrific
little Italian place.

04:56.560 --> 04:58.260
I never eat
in strange restaurants.

04:58.260 --> 05:00.900
One runs the risk
of non-standard cutlery.

05:00.900 --> 05:02.860
Excuse me?

05:02.860 --> 05:06.930
Sheldon lives in fear
of the three-tined fork.

05:06.930 --> 05:08.730
Three tines is not a fork.

05:08.730 --> 05:10.460
Three tines is a trident.

05:10.460 --> 05:11.700
Forks are for eating,

05:11.700 --> 05:15.300
tridents are for
ruling the seven seas.

05:15.300 --> 05:17.260
What if I brought food
to your place?

05:17.260 --> 05:19.030
That would be acceptable.

05:19.030 --> 05:20.960
On Mondays, I eat Thai food.

05:20.960 --> 05:22.730
Mee krob and chicken sate

05:22.730 --> 05:24.830
with extra peanut sauce
from Siam Palace.

05:24.830 --> 05:26.060
You got it.

05:26.060 --> 05:28.130
I already have your address.

05:31.130 --> 05:33.630
What a nice girl.

05:33.630 --> 05:36.760
Sheldon, do you have
any idea what just happened?

05:36.760 --> 05:40.560
Yes. Apparently I'm getting
a free dinner.

05:44.800 --> 05:47.930
Oh, yeah, no, this thing's
majorly out of order.

05:47.930 --> 05:49.530
See? Sorry.

05:49.530 --> 05:50.730
That's okay.

05:50.730 --> 05:52.200
Guess I'm taking
the stairs.

05:52.200 --> 05:53.300
Where you going?

05:53.300 --> 05:54.460
4-A.

05:54.460 --> 05:55.800
Oh, are you here
to see Leonard?

05:55.800 --> 05:57.630
No, Dr. Cooper.

05:57.630 --> 06:00.630
Dr. Sheldon Cooper?

06:00.630 --> 06:02.360
We're having dinner.

06:02.360 --> 06:04.630
Sheldon Cooper?

06:06.060 --> 06:07.400
Tall, thin,

06:07.400 --> 06:11.730
looks a little like
a giant praying mantis?

06:11.730 --> 06:15.030
He is cute, isn't he?

06:17.300 --> 06:19.430
Sheldon Cooper?

06:22.530 --> 06:23.700
Hi, Leonard.

06:23.700 --> 06:24.960
Hey, Ramona. Come on in.

06:24.960 --> 06:26.630
Thanks. Where should
I put this?

06:26.630 --> 06:28.030
Uh, the kitchen's fine.

06:28.030 --> 06:29.160
Hey, what are you doing?

06:29.160 --> 06:31.760
I need to see this.
Uh-huh.

06:31.760 --> 06:34.700
The viewing area's
right over there.

06:38.030 --> 06:41.330
Sheldon, your girl... date...
person... Ramona's here.

06:41.330 --> 06:43.700
Oh, hello.

06:43.700 --> 06:45.160
Oh, sorry I'm late.

06:45.160 --> 06:47.560
I just got so caught up reading
the draft of your latest paper.

06:47.560 --> 06:49.460
Did you enjoy
the humorous footnote

06:49.460 --> 06:50.900
where I illustrate
mirror-symmetry

06:50.900 --> 06:53.300
by likening it to the Flash
playing tennis with himself?

06:53.300 --> 06:55.000
So funny.

06:56.500 --> 06:59.030
But the idea that you might be
able to incorporate gravity,

06:59.030 --> 07:03.830
I have to tell you, I found
it  physically exhilarating.

07:03.830 --> 07:07.060
My hypotheses tend
to have that effect.

07:08.800 --> 07:10.330
I'm sorry I didn't
bring enough

07:10.330 --> 07:11.560
for your friends.

07:11.560 --> 07:14.000
I assumed we were
going to be alone.

07:15.460 --> 07:17.030
Oh, yeah.

07:17.030 --> 07:19.160
No, we were just going.

07:19.160 --> 07:20.760
To watch, right?

07:20.760 --> 07:24.460
No, come on, now,
we're going out.

07:24.460 --> 07:27.000
Oh, come on,
we'll be quiet.

07:27.000 --> 07:28.700
Let's go, let's go.

07:30.030 --> 07:31.360
Okay, you two.

07:31.360 --> 07:34.060
Have a nice...

07:34.060 --> 07:36.600
whatever this is.

07:39.530 --> 07:40.660
Okay, you guys, look,

07:40.660 --> 07:42.300
I know this is none
of my business,

07:42.300 --> 07:43.960
but I just... I have to ask--

07:43.960 --> 07:46.200
what's Sheldon's deal?

07:48.400 --> 07:50.800
What do you mean "deal"?

07:50.800 --> 07:52.800
You know, like what's his deal?

07:52.800 --> 07:56.460
Is it girls...? Guys...?
Sock puppets...?

07:56.460 --> 07:58.930
Honestly, we've been operating
under the assumption

07:58.930 --> 08:01.230
that he has no deal.

08:01.230 --> 08:03.230
Come on, everybody has a deal.

08:03.230 --> 08:04.530
Not Sheldon.

08:04.530 --> 08:06.530
Over the years, we've
formulated many theories

08:06.530 --> 08:08.960
about how he might reproduce.

08:09.830 --> 08:13.330
I'm an advocate
of mitosis.

08:13.330 --> 08:15.160
I'm sorry?

08:15.160 --> 08:18.000
I believe one day Sheldon
will eat an enormous amount

08:18.000 --> 08:22.230
of Thai food and split
into two Sheldons.

08:23.700 --> 08:25.200
On the other hand,
I think Sheldon

08:25.200 --> 08:27.030
might be the larval form
of his species,

08:27.030 --> 08:29.300
and someday he'll spin a cocoon
and emerge two months later

08:29.300 --> 08:31.660
with moth wings
and an exoskeleton.

08:31.660 --> 08:35.830
Okay, well, thanks
for the nightmares.

08:35.830 --> 08:39.400
Hey, do you want to
hang out with us?

08:39.400 --> 08:41.260
What are you guys gonna do?

08:41.260 --> 08:43.700
Uh...

08:43.700 --> 08:45.860
My mom's making
a brisket tonight.

08:45.860 --> 08:51.660
The one with the
little onions? Mm...

08:51.660 --> 08:55.930
Yeah, I'm busy, so...

08:55.930 --> 08:57.800
Good night.

08:57.800 --> 09:00.830
Her loss. Let's go.

09:00.830 --> 09:02.760
Brisket party!

09:02.760 --> 09:05.100
B-to-the-R-to-the-I-S-K...

09:05.930 --> 09:08.500
To-the-E-to-the-T...

09:09.200 --> 09:10.530
* Ooh...
Don't.

09:16.000 --> 09:17.300
Hey, aren't you
having breakfast?

09:17.300 --> 09:19.800
Yes.

09:19.800 --> 09:23.460
Are you experimenting with
nutritional suppositories again?

09:23.460 --> 09:27.030
Not in these pants.

09:27.030 --> 09:31.000
So... how'd it go with
Ramona last night?

09:31.000 --> 09:32.760
Oh, great.

09:32.760 --> 09:34.700
She's smart, insightful

09:34.700 --> 09:38.860
and she has a very unique way
of, you know, revering me.

09:40.460 --> 09:43.100
Here's your spinach mushroom
omelet .

09:43.100 --> 09:45.500
Thank you.

09:45.500 --> 09:47.130
Did anyone touch it?

09:47.130 --> 09:49.060
Gloves were worn
by everyone involved.

09:49.060 --> 09:50.400
I was vigilant.

09:51.760 --> 09:54.430
Ramona pointed out that I've
been wasting 20 minutes a day

09:54.430 --> 09:56.500
standing on cafeteria lines.

09:56.500 --> 09:57.930
Time which would be
better spent

09:57.930 --> 09:59.800
tackling the great physics
problems of our day.

09:59.800 --> 10:01.660
You don't tackle
the big issues, Ramona.

10:01.660 --> 10:02.660
You fence with them.

10:02.660 --> 10:06.060
En garde. Riposte.

10:09.000 --> 10:11.000
Touche.

10:11.000 --> 10:12.430
Morning.

10:12.430 --> 10:13.600
Hi, Leslie.

10:13.600 --> 10:14.700
So, Sheldon,

10:14.700 --> 10:16.360
I see you're
organizing your papers

10:16.360 --> 10:19.630
for the Smithsonian Museum
of Dumbassery.

10:19.630 --> 10:21.500
There won't be any room

10:21.500 --> 10:24.930
until they get rid of the
permanent Leslie Winkle exhibit.

10:26.330 --> 10:27.830
Oh, good one.

10:27.830 --> 10:31.330
I see you got a grad student
to fight your battles for you.

10:31.330 --> 10:33.860
I'll let you keep
your lunch money today.

10:33.860 --> 10:36.760
Okay, Dr. Cooper is on the verge
of a breakthrough.

10:36.760 --> 10:37.830
If you're going to stay,

10:37.830 --> 10:40.730
you'll have to be respectful
and quiet.

10:48.430 --> 10:49.700
Wait for me.

10:53.160 --> 10:56.030
So have you worked
out the neutrino issue?

10:56.030 --> 10:58.230
Well, to paraphrase Mozart,

10:58.230 --> 10:59.730
all the subatomic particles
are there.

10:59.730 --> 11:01.900
I just have to put them
in the right order.

11:01.900 --> 11:03.200
You're so witty.

11:03.200 --> 11:05.260
Aren't I?

11:08.730 --> 11:10.100
(knocking)

11:10.100 --> 11:12.300
Hey, guys,
this package came for...

11:16.230 --> 11:17.900
Dr. Cooper is working.

11:17.900 --> 11:20.230
Yes, I'm close
to a breakthrough.

11:20.230 --> 11:21.560
Ooh, it tickles!

11:22.900 --> 11:24.530
Sorry.

11:28.960 --> 11:32.100
Holy crap on a cracker.

11:32.100 --> 11:34.230
Hey, Penny.

11:34.230 --> 11:36.430
Hi. You probably don't want
to go in there.

11:36.430 --> 11:37.930
Why?
What are they doing?

11:37.930 --> 11:40.630
The only way I could explain it

11:40.630 --> 11:43.260
would be in a therapist's office
with dolls.

11:51.760 --> 11:54.330
Hoo-boy.

11:54.330 --> 11:57.130
Dr. Cooper's working.

11:57.130 --> 11:59.330
Yeah, I can see that.

11:59.330 --> 12:02.460
<i>Sheldon, Halo night,
Koothrappali's. You coming?</i>

12:02.460 --> 12:04.930
<i>Oh, yes, it's Halo night.</i>

12:04.930 --> 12:06.660
Let me just dry my tootsies.

12:06.660 --> 12:08.960
<i>You're not going to Halo night.</i>

12:08.960 --> 12:10.160
Yes, I am.

12:10.160 --> 12:13.160
<i>It's Wednesday.
Wednesday's Halo night.</i>

12:13.160 --> 12:16.760
Didn't a great man once say,
"Science demands nothing less

12:16.760 --> 12:18.830
"than the fervent and
unconditional dedication

12:18.830 --> 12:20.400
of our entire lives"?

12:20.400 --> 12:22.000
He did.

12:22.000 --> 12:23.760
And who was that great man?

12:23.760 --> 12:26.530
Me.

12:27.460 --> 12:29.130
Sorry, Leonard.

12:29.130 --> 12:30.660
Seriously? You're not coming?

12:30.660 --> 12:34.300
You heard her.
How can I argue with me?

12:34.300 --> 12:38.930
Okay, well, once again,
you guys have a good...

12:38.930 --> 12:41.160
whatever this is.

12:43.030 --> 12:45.200
Dr. Cooper, I have
to tell you

12:45.200 --> 12:46.860
your friends are
holding you back.

12:46.860 --> 12:50.300
I prefer to think of it
as "I'm pulling them forward."

12:50.300 --> 12:53.160
<i>Halo night?</i>

12:53.160 --> 12:54.400
A man with
your intellectual gifts

12:54.400 --> 12:57.060
doesn't waste an evening
playing video games.

12:57.060 --> 12:59.560
He does on Wednesdays.

12:59.560 --> 13:01.930
Not if he wants a Nobel Prize.

13:01.930 --> 13:05.760
He does want that.

13:05.760 --> 13:08.660
Does a man with my
intellectual gifts

13:08.660 --> 13:09.860
play paintball on weekends?

13:09.860 --> 13:11.560
What do you think?

13:11.560 --> 13:13.600
Drat.

13:13.600 --> 13:16.530
Now shall we get back to work?

13:16.530 --> 13:19.200
I suppose.

13:22.200 --> 13:24.060
<i>Battlestar Galactica
comes on tonight.</i>

13:24.830 --> 13:27.100
I guess I can wait for the DVD.

13:28.160 --> 13:31.600
And then never ever watch it.

13:39.500 --> 13:42.830
* You can be my Yoko Ono

13:44.060 --> 13:49.000
* You can follow me
wherever I go *

13:49.000 --> 13:53.060
* Be my, be my,
be my Yoko Ono, whoa-oa *

13:56.330 --> 13:57.560
* Now that I'm far away

13:57.560 --> 14:01.100
* It doesn't seem to me
to be such a pain *

14:04.130 --> 14:06.800
* To have you hanging off
my ankle *

14:06.800 --> 14:09.360
* Like some kind of ball
and chain *

14:12.130 --> 14:16.830
* You can be my Yoko Ono

14:16.830 --> 14:19.330
* You can follow me
wherever I go *

14:19.330 --> 14:25.100
<i>* You can be my Yoko Ono
* Whoa-oa-oa *</i>

14:25.100 --> 14:28.630
* You can follow me
wherever I go. *

14:30.400 --> 14:32.530
(hushed):
Penny! Penny!

14:32.530 --> 14:33.930
Penny!

14:33.930 --> 14:35.400
Sheldon, honey,
I've told you,

14:35.400 --> 14:36.560
it's a small apartment.

14:36.560 --> 14:38.030
You only have to knock
one time.

14:38.030 --> 14:40.200
Please, please, I don't have
a lot of time.

14:40.200 --> 14:41.260
Look, Ramona finally dozed off,

14:41.260 --> 14:43.960
and I need you to help me
get rid of her.

14:45.960 --> 14:47.800
Get rid of her how?

14:47.800 --> 14:49.100
I don't know,

14:49.100 --> 14:51.230
but apparently I'm in
some kind of relationship,

14:51.230 --> 14:55.300
and you seem to be an expert
at ending them.

14:58.730 --> 15:00.160
Excuse me?

15:00.160 --> 15:03.760
I see man after man leaving
this apartment never to return.

15:03.760 --> 15:08.030
Okay, first of all,
it is not man after man.

15:08.030 --> 15:10.100
Dr. Cooper?!
Hide me.

15:10.100 --> 15:12.230
Hide you?

15:12.230 --> 15:14.360
I formally request sanctuary.

15:15.230 --> 15:17.100
Why aren't you working?

15:17.100 --> 15:19.130
Um...

15:19.130 --> 15:20.800
she distracted me.

15:22.030 --> 15:24.630
I told you, Penny,
I don't have time
for your nonsense.

15:24.630 --> 15:26.730
I have important things to do.

15:29.460 --> 15:31.060
Oh, man.

15:31.060 --> 15:32.360
I know what's going on here.

15:32.360 --> 15:33.400
Really?

15:33.400 --> 15:35.460
Well, then will you
explain it to me?

15:35.460 --> 15:37.730
You're in love
with Dr. Cooper.

15:37.730 --> 15:41.500
Uh, yeah, no, that's not it.

15:41.500 --> 15:43.260
Don't try to deny it.

15:43.260 --> 15:45.060
He's a remarkable man,

15:45.060 --> 15:47.830
but you have
to let him go.

15:47.830 --> 15:50.700
Oh, gee, okay.

15:50.700 --> 15:53.800
I know it's hard, but he's
a gift to the whole world,

15:53.800 --> 15:55.330
and we can't be selfish.

15:55.330 --> 15:58.500
Yeah, he's a gift all right.

15:58.500 --> 16:01.360
Sisters?

16:02.930 --> 16:04.700
Uh, sure.

16:04.700 --> 16:06.460
Sisters.

16:10.460 --> 16:13.760
Holy crap on a cracker.

16:14.930 --> 16:16.900
(rhythmic tapping on wall)

16:20.460 --> 16:23.130
Sheldon?

16:23.130 --> 16:24.430
(tapping stops)

16:24.430 --> 16:26.830
(tapping resumes)

16:28.700 --> 16:31.330
What are you doing?!

16:31.330 --> 16:33.000
It's Morse code.

16:33.000 --> 16:35.500
Why?

16:35.500 --> 16:38.100
So we can communicate
through the wall.

16:38.100 --> 16:42.060
<i>We are communicating
through the wall.</i>

16:42.060 --> 16:46.200
Yes, but the communication
is not encrypted.

16:46.200 --> 16:48.060
I don't know Morse code.

16:48.060 --> 16:49.000
It's very simple.

16:49.000 --> 16:50.730
This is A (taps)...

16:50.730 --> 16:52.330
This is B (taps)...
This is C...

16:52.330 --> 16:54.600
Sheldon, I'm not going
to learn Morse code

16:54.600 --> 16:55.860
at 3:00 in the morning!

16:55.860 --> 16:58.360
All right.

16:58.360 --> 17:01.360
Don't come in here, don't come
in here, don't come in here,

17:01.360 --> 17:04.400
don't... Oh!

17:04.400 --> 17:05.900
(sighs)

17:05.900 --> 17:06.930
What's going on?

17:06.930 --> 17:09.460
Shh!
Ramona's sleeping on the couch.

17:09.460 --> 17:11.359
I know.
When is she going home?

17:11.359 --> 17:13.900
Never.
That's the problem.

17:13.900 --> 17:15.130
I need your help.

17:15.130 --> 17:16.800
What are you talking about?

17:16.800 --> 17:20.960
I'm invoking the Skynet clause
of our friendship agreement.

17:20.960 --> 17:22.930
That only applies if you need me

17:22.930 --> 17:24.730
to help you destroy
an artificial intelligence

17:24.730 --> 17:27.500
you've created that's taking
over the Earth.

17:27.500 --> 17:28.860
Come on! Don't nitpick!

17:30.760 --> 17:32.830
Good night.

17:32.830 --> 17:35.330
Shh. All right.

17:35.330 --> 17:37.900
I'm invoking our
Body Snatchers clause.

17:37.900 --> 17:39.930
The Body Snatchers clause
requires me

17:39.930 --> 17:41.730
to help you destroy
someone we know

17:41.730 --> 17:43.930
who's been replaced
with an alien pod.

17:43.930 --> 17:45.560
Yes. She's in the
living room. Go.

17:45.560 --> 17:46.630
I'll wait here.

17:46.630 --> 17:49.300
Sheldon, what are you doing
out of bed?

17:49.300 --> 17:51.700
Now! Do it!

17:53.500 --> 17:55.160
You know you need your sleep

17:55.160 --> 17:56.600
in order for your
cognitive processing

17:56.600 --> 17:58.630
to perform at
optimum levels.
Now come on.

17:58.630 --> 18:00.600
Godzilla clause?

18:00.600 --> 18:03.700
Not unless she
destroys Tokyo.

18:03.700 --> 18:06.000
Rats.

18:07.200 --> 18:08.930
I've got it!

18:08.930 --> 18:10.030
I finally reconciled

18:10.030 --> 18:11.530
the black hole
information paradox

18:11.530 --> 18:13.830
with my theory
of string-network
condensates!

18:13.830 --> 18:15.560
RAMONA:
It's unbelievable!

18:15.560 --> 18:17.260
It's paradigm-altering.

18:17.260 --> 18:19.100
And I could not have done it
without you.

18:19.100 --> 18:21.360
Oh, please, I just offered
a little encouragement.

18:21.360 --> 18:22.860
It was a lot more than that.

18:22.860 --> 18:25.260
You helped me work out the
masses of all the fermions

18:25.260 --> 18:27.330
and you pumiced my hammer toe.

18:28.960 --> 18:30.430
How can I ever repay you?

18:30.430 --> 18:34.100
Well, would you consider naming
it the Cooper-Nowitzki Theorem?

18:34.100 --> 18:36.430
Who's Nowitzki?

18:36.430 --> 18:38.630
I'm Nowitzki.

18:38.630 --> 18:40.930
Oh, you want me to share credit?

18:40.930 --> 18:41.900
Uh-huh.

18:41.900 --> 18:45.360
Get out!

18:46.530 --> 18:47.330
Oh, hey, hi.

18:47.330 --> 18:51.000
Oh, bite me!

18:51.000 --> 18:53.700
Sisters?

18:56.460 --> 18:58.700
Excuse me, Dr. Cooper.

18:58.700 --> 19:00.330
I'm Kathy O'Brien.

19:00.330 --> 19:01.660
I just finished reading
your paper

19:01.660 --> 19:03.930
reconciling the black hole
information paradox

19:03.930 --> 19:06.260
with your theory of string-
network condensates,

19:06.260 --> 19:08.100
and it just took
my breath away.

19:08.100 --> 19:13.230
Maybe when I publish it,
I'll include an inhaler.

19:15.560 --> 19:18.930
Would you possibly have any time
for me to pick your brain?

19:18.930 --> 19:21.400
Let's see. Today's Thursday.

19:21.400 --> 19:23.360
Thursday nights, I eat pizza
from Giacomo's.

19:23.360 --> 19:24.860
Sausage, mushrooms,
light olives.

19:24.860 --> 19:26.900
Great.
I'll bring it to your place.

19:26.900 --> 19:28.660
I have the address.

19:31.230 --> 19:33.630
What a nice girl.

19:34.560 --> 19:37.900
Sheldon, do you see
what just happened here?

19:37.900 --> 19:41.500
Yes, I'm getting a free pizza.

19:50.100 --> 19:52.230
More pad Thai, please.

19:52.230 --> 19:54.560
Sheldon, you've already had
four servings.

19:54.560 --> 19:56.030
You might want to slow down
a bit, buddy.

19:56.030 --> 19:59.230
Just one more bite.

20:06.700 --> 20:08.730
Sheldon?

20:08.730 --> 20:10.060
Sheldon, are you okay?

20:10.060 --> 20:13.160
I'm just so... full.

20:21.460 --> 20:23.400
(gasps)

20:24.200 --> 20:25.830
That's it. No more Thai food.
