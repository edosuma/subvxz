[Abby]
Previously on Swamp Thing...

00:21.369 --> 00:23.719
[Abby]  It's Harlan.
He's come down
with the disease.

00:23.806 --> 00:25.155
I need to get into Holland's
lab and figure out what
he was working on.

00:25.242 --> 00:26.678
With any luck,  it'll point me towards a cure.

00:26.765 --> 00:27.679
[Daniel] Come on, Xanadu.
Break out those cards.

00:27.766 --> 00:29.507
Give me one more reading.

00:29.594 --> 00:30.726
[Madame Xanadu]
Eight years since you've
come to Marais,

00:30.813 --> 00:32.945
and your cards never change.

00:33.033 --> 00:34.208
This time they're reversed.

00:34.295 --> 00:35.600
Is that good?

00:35.687 --> 00:36.427
Did someone new
come into your life?

00:36.514 --> 00:38.429
Abby Arcane.

00:38.516 --> 00:40.170
Do you think she's
the one I'm supposed
to be waiting for?

00:40.257 --> 00:43.565
Dr. Woodrue, he just needs
one more tranche of funding.

00:43.652 --> 00:45.393
You need more
of my family's money.

00:45.480 --> 00:46.742
The answer is no.

00:46.829 --> 00:47.743
[Avery]
What are you doing, Maria?

00:47.830 --> 00:49.658
You're not cutting me off!

00:49.745 --> 00:51.964
I don't understand
this disease and why
it's fighting us.

00:52.052 --> 00:53.575
[Swamp Thing] Not fighting.

00:53.662 --> 00:55.533
Fighting back.

00:55.620 --> 00:57.579
The antibiotics are
just making things worse.

00:57.666 --> 00:58.623
Doctor, the BP is dropping.

01:03.846 --> 01:06.109
I know you've been
making off-the-books loans
to Avery Sunderland.

01:06.196 --> 01:07.458
I don't know what
you think you've got,

01:07.545 --> 01:09.895
but it's complete
and utter bullshit.

01:09.982 --> 01:11.245
You gotta cover
for that missing money.

01:11.332 --> 01:12.942
You're gonna keep
your goddamn mouth shut.

01:13.029 --> 01:14.900
Or I could just talk
to the press and

01:14.987 --> 01:17.425
tell them what I know
about you and the Conclave.

01:17.512 --> 01:19.122
-You son of a bitch!
-[yells]

01:32.831 --> 01:34.094
[door shuts]

01:52.416 --> 01:53.374
What are you waiting for?
Shank him!

01:56.725 --> 01:58.335
Damn it, Avery!
Get your ass over here!

01:58.422 --> 01:59.467
[gator growls]

01:59.554 --> 02:00.859
Now open this bitch up!

02:14.090 --> 02:15.222
[Burritt]  Come on, son!

02:15.309 --> 02:16.310
[Young Avery]  I can't.

02:16.397 --> 02:17.528
I can't.

02:18.529 --> 02:19.400
I know you can.

02:20.444 --> 02:21.358
Look at its eyes.

02:22.185 --> 02:23.665
Dead eyes.

02:23.752 --> 02:25.145
Swamp eyes.

02:25.232 --> 02:27.799
Not worth a second of mercy.

02:27.886 --> 02:28.887
[Burritt's voice echoes]
A second of mercy.

02:34.328 --> 02:35.503
-Come on, son!
-[gator growls]

02:35.590 --> 02:36.373
Come on!

02:40.160 --> 02:41.248
[sighs] Worthless...

02:45.426 --> 02:46.209
[grunts]

03:10.625 --> 03:13.105
[Todd] Hey, you don't think
there's, uh, snakes up there,
do you?

03:14.672 --> 03:16.761
There's snakes everywhere, kid.

03:16.848 --> 03:19.199
Had one yelling at me
yesterday.

03:19.286 --> 03:20.939
About a house payment.

03:26.597 --> 03:27.381
In there.

03:28.469 --> 03:29.252
You see 'em?

03:36.477 --> 03:37.608
Behind the cottonwoods.

03:39.871 --> 03:41.482
[Todd] This is sweet.

03:41.569 --> 03:43.397
You know how hard it is
to find a stand of cypress

03:43.484 --> 03:45.616
that big timber hadn't
pissed over first?

03:45.703 --> 03:48.402
[chuckles] You gotta wait till
you get 50 yards in.

03:48.489 --> 03:50.273
[branch breaks]

03:50.360 --> 03:52.710
We'll, uh...
We'll cut through
this little shit,

03:52.797 --> 03:55.060
and, uh, make a path.

03:58.673 --> 04:00.240
[chainsaw revs]

04:00.327 --> 04:02.242
[chainsaw buzzing]

04:10.511 --> 04:11.468
What the hell?

04:16.430 --> 04:18.258
[chainsaw continues buzzing]

04:28.050 --> 04:29.660
Hey! Hey! Stop!

04:29.747 --> 04:31.575
Hey! Hey!

04:32.533 --> 04:33.403
Hey! Stop!

04:33.490 --> 04:34.491
[branch snaps]

04:37.451 --> 04:39.017
[screaming]

04:47.374 --> 04:48.200
[Todd] It cut me!

04:50.159 --> 04:51.334
It's a fucking corpse!

04:54.250 --> 04:55.817
Let's get back to the boat!

04:58.210 --> 05:00.169
Come on! That way!

05:25.760 --> 05:27.457
[theme music playing]

06:31.391 --> 06:33.654
[upbeat country music playing]

06:33.741 --> 06:35.612
Sorry I'm late.

06:35.699 --> 06:38.615
I got caught up
on the water last night.

06:38.702 --> 06:41.009
Butler dragging you around
Ochee Forks again?

06:41.096 --> 06:42.793
[Todd] Yeah.

06:42.880 --> 06:43.577
[Delroy]
That place is nowhere
to be after dark.

06:43.664 --> 06:45.796
Don't worry.

06:45.883 --> 06:47.015
I'm never going back
there again.

06:52.499 --> 06:53.325
[sighs]

06:56.285 --> 06:57.765
Ugh. This damn cut!

07:10.386 --> 07:11.213
[gasps]

07:13.345 --> 07:14.172
What's wrong?

07:14.956 --> 07:15.783
I saw something.

07:15.870 --> 07:16.653
It was moving.

07:22.398 --> 07:24.487
I don't see anything movin'.

07:24.574 --> 07:27.011
Especially not those
pots and pans,
if you catch my drift.

07:28.186 --> 07:29.187
-Yes, ma'am.
-Mmm-hmm.

07:41.286 --> 07:43.637
[Delroy] Liz, you got
those cleaning supplies sorted?

07:43.724 --> 07:44.942
[Liz] Almost, Pops.

07:46.030 --> 07:46.814
It bit me!

07:48.424 --> 07:50.208
It bit me! It bit me!

07:50.295 --> 07:52.297
-[Liz] Todd, what's going on?
-[snake rattling]

07:52.384 --> 07:53.255
[gasping]

07:55.605 --> 07:57.172
-[Liz] Todd!
-It's a goddamn snake!

07:57.259 --> 07:59.261
Hey! Todd! Todd! Hey!

07:59.348 --> 08:01.219
[Liz] Todd! What snake?

08:01.306 --> 08:02.090
-Todd.
-[screams]

08:05.267 --> 08:07.008
[Delroy] Todd, stop,
there's nothing there.

08:07.095 --> 08:09.053
-Whoa, whoa, whoa!
-Hey!

08:09.140 --> 08:11.360
-[Delroy] Todd!
-Get it off me!

08:11.447 --> 08:12.927
-Get it off me!
-[Liz] Drop the knife!

08:13.014 --> 08:15.320
-[screams] Get it off me!
-[Liz] Todd! No!

08:15.407 --> 08:17.018
[panicking gasps]

08:17.105 --> 08:18.585
Back! Get back!

08:18.672 --> 08:19.847
[Liz] There's no snake!

08:19.934 --> 08:21.370
[Delroy] Hey, hey!
Todd! No!

08:21.457 --> 08:23.372
[screams in pain]

08:23.459 --> 08:24.460
-[whimpering]
-[snake rattles]

08:26.593 --> 08:27.898
[Delroy] Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

08:30.074 --> 08:31.249
[Todd screaming]

08:33.208 --> 08:34.688
[screaming]

08:35.863 --> 08:37.299
[Liz] What did you do?

08:39.127 --> 08:40.868
-[Liz] Todd.
-[panting]

08:40.955 --> 08:41.738
Talk to me.

08:46.134 --> 08:47.396
God...

08:47.483 --> 08:48.789
[Liz] No. Stay with me. Hey.

08:48.876 --> 08:51.792
-[Delroy] Todd.
-[Liz] Hey. Stay with me.

09:02.063 --> 09:02.846
[Abby] Alec!

09:06.371 --> 09:08.852
I'm here to help you!
I'm not leaving you
here alone!

09:14.466 --> 09:15.293
Alec!

09:27.784 --> 09:28.568
Alec?

09:31.658 --> 09:33.398
Alec, is that you?

09:35.705 --> 09:37.489
[branches creaking]

10:13.874 --> 10:15.484
I want us to figure this out,

10:15.571 --> 10:17.094
Alec...

10:17.181 --> 10:18.400
But we have to
do it together.

10:19.923 --> 10:23.448
[sighs]
Can I have a tissue sample?

10:23.535 --> 10:24.362
Please?

10:31.979 --> 10:33.545
[branches creaking]

10:45.775 --> 10:46.602
Thank you.

10:50.475 --> 10:53.043
Tell me what I've become.

10:53.130 --> 10:53.914
Whatever you find.

10:54.610 --> 10:55.437
I will.

10:57.526 --> 10:58.701
Be careful coming back.

11:00.050 --> 11:01.138
There's danger here.

11:16.850 --> 11:18.590
[whispers] What is happening
to you, Alec?

11:19.287 --> 11:20.070
[door opens]

11:40.177 --> 11:41.004
[scoffs]

11:42.789 --> 11:44.442
You've made a mistake
in your data.

11:46.140 --> 11:46.923
Excuse me?

11:51.667 --> 11:53.321
These numbers.

11:53.408 --> 11:55.062
They can only refer to
the thickness of a cell wall,

11:55.149 --> 11:57.281
which means you're
describing a plant.

11:57.368 --> 11:59.719
But the cell circumferences
are round and irregular,

11:59.806 --> 12:01.242
more suited to something
with mobility.

12:01.329 --> 12:03.070
So it's either a plant,

12:03.157 --> 12:03.940
or an animal.

12:05.463 --> 12:06.290
Now pick one.

12:08.162 --> 12:10.468
And what if I told you
my entries are accurate?

12:10.555 --> 12:12.775
Well, the last
ten million years

12:12.862 --> 12:14.864
of biology would
disagree with you.

12:14.951 --> 12:16.039
As would I.

12:28.008 --> 12:29.270
[Jason sighs]

12:30.793 --> 12:32.229
Would you, uh...

12:33.535 --> 12:34.710
Would you like me
to take a look?

12:38.975 --> 12:39.759
Sure.

13:00.475 --> 13:03.304
Well, this is...
This is plant tissue,

13:03.391 --> 13:06.307
but it's organized
like animal tissue.

13:06.394 --> 13:07.612
It fits no known phylum.

13:07.699 --> 13:09.310
I assume that you, uh...

13:10.528 --> 13:11.660
found this in the swamp?

13:19.233 --> 13:21.713
What are you, um,
planning to do with it?

13:23.759 --> 13:25.892
Well, a full analysis.

13:25.979 --> 13:28.155
I need to identify
the chromosomal makeup,

13:28.242 --> 13:29.591
the genetic markers...

13:29.678 --> 13:32.159
-Yeah.
-What? What?

13:32.246 --> 13:37.599
How extensive is
your knowledge of
bio-genetics? Botany?

13:37.686 --> 13:40.994
Well, you know,
I'm an infectious
diseases specialist.

13:41.081 --> 13:45.259
Which is why
you should allow me
to analyze this sample,

13:45.346 --> 13:48.305
that's if you actually
wanna know what it is.

13:50.481 --> 13:51.308
Dr. Arcane...

13:53.963 --> 13:56.183
If I forced you to study
my CV--

13:56.270 --> 13:59.055
I know who you are,
Dr. Woodrue.

13:59.142 --> 14:04.017
And I know that
you're working
for Avery Sunderland.

14:04.104 --> 14:06.410
But what possible difference
could that make?

14:12.590 --> 14:14.505
If I agree to this,

14:14.592 --> 14:17.030
I expect confidentiality
and full transparency,

14:17.117 --> 14:19.075
whatever you find,
you bring to me first.

14:19.162 --> 14:21.121
I need to understand exactly
what we're dealing with

14:21.208 --> 14:24.559
before I share these results
with the rest of the world.

14:24.646 --> 14:26.778
Why would I give a damn
about the rest of the world?

14:31.871 --> 14:32.741
Excuse me.

14:35.744 --> 14:37.224
Mr. Cassidy.

14:37.311 --> 14:39.095
Do you have a second job?

14:39.182 --> 14:41.968
Oh, no. I just brought in
some stuff for the kids.

14:42.055 --> 14:44.579
They get a charge
when the Blue Devil
makes the rounds.

14:44.666 --> 14:46.537
Huh. That's kind of you.

14:47.277 --> 14:48.061
Dr. Arcane.

14:49.584 --> 14:51.064
Have we met before?

14:51.151 --> 14:54.284
Before Marais, I mean.

14:54.371 --> 14:56.243
I don't mean to sound weird,
it's just I... I don't know,

14:56.330 --> 14:58.723
I got this feeling, you know?
Like...

14:58.810 --> 15:00.856
-Deja vu.
-Yeah.

15:00.943 --> 15:02.945
-Deja vu.
-Yeah, I don't...

15:03.032 --> 15:04.468
I don't think so.

15:04.555 --> 15:05.165
I'm pretty sure
I would've remembered you.

15:07.776 --> 15:09.169
-Anyway, I have to get inside.
-Right. Sure.

15:12.346 --> 15:13.956
So I'm supposed to be
helping her, right?

15:15.305 --> 15:16.089
Right?

15:17.307 --> 15:18.134
Why am I asking balloons?

15:19.396 --> 15:20.180
Shit.

15:20.789 --> 15:21.616
Shit.

15:25.228 --> 15:26.926
I'm so happy
you're feeling better.

15:37.501 --> 15:38.850
You remember everything, huh?

15:40.504 --> 15:41.853
[Susie] I can still see him
in my head.

15:43.159 --> 15:44.334
I'm scared for him.

15:49.252 --> 15:50.036
And for you.

15:50.862 --> 15:51.689
Don't be.

15:52.603 --> 15:54.040
Okay?

15:54.127 --> 15:56.651
[Avery]
Excuse me, everybody.

15:56.738 --> 16:01.351
Maria and I are so happy that
you're all feelin' better.

16:01.438 --> 16:03.832
To celebrate the good news,

16:03.919 --> 16:07.053
we are inviting everyone
who is able,

16:07.140 --> 16:12.014
to Marais Town Hall tonight,
for an old-style crawfish boil.

16:12.101 --> 16:14.321
-[all applauding]
-[man] All right!

16:14.408 --> 16:16.149
So you can invite
your friends,

16:16.236 --> 16:18.978
you invite your family.
Hell, bring a stranger.

16:19.891 --> 16:22.024
We'll kick off at sunset.

16:22.111 --> 16:25.114
It's time to bust off
the dust,

16:25.201 --> 16:26.768
and get this town
movin' again.

16:26.855 --> 16:29.162
[all applauding]

16:29.249 --> 16:30.337
-I'll be right back.
-Right.

16:32.034 --> 16:33.644
Okay, sweetie,
let's put this away.

16:38.910 --> 16:41.174
Is this the little girl
that was lost in the swamp?

16:42.218 --> 16:44.612
Yes. Susie Coyle.

16:44.699 --> 16:46.266
Susie, this is
Mrs. Sunderland.

16:47.615 --> 16:49.051
I'm sure you have
things to do.

16:49.138 --> 16:51.053
Why don't you go on
and I'll sit with her.

16:55.275 --> 16:57.364
-Is it okay?
-Yeah.

16:58.104 --> 16:58.930
All right.

17:09.985 --> 17:11.900
Oh. What have you got there?

17:12.640 --> 17:14.642
I drew him more.

17:14.729 --> 17:15.904
Oh, show me.

17:21.083 --> 17:22.867
Oh, hey, Abby.

17:22.954 --> 17:24.260
-Hey.
-Hey.

17:24.347 --> 17:26.088
Good to see you,
but I'm surprised.

17:26.175 --> 17:28.917
I thought that the CDC
had packed up tent.

17:29.004 --> 17:31.311
Yeah. Well,
we're out of crisis mode.

17:31.398 --> 17:34.879
But, uh, not ready to
declare "mission accomplished"
yet, so...

17:34.966 --> 17:36.533
I see.

17:36.620 --> 17:37.926
Is that little girl,
she's waiting for Lee Coyle?

17:38.013 --> 17:39.710
Yeah, he should
be here by now.

17:39.797 --> 17:41.234
[chuckles]

17:41.321 --> 17:43.975
Well, ol' Lee is not
exactly a model citizen.

17:45.064 --> 17:47.414
Well, should I be worried?

17:47.501 --> 17:51.635
Man knows his way
around a beer bottle is all.

17:51.722 --> 17:53.463
[voice on PA]  Dr. Arcane,
you have a phone call
holding.

17:53.550 --> 17:55.900
Please come to reception.

17:55.987 --> 17:58.816
I don't think I've seen Maria
smile like that in months.

18:01.036 --> 18:02.472
-I... I should go. I...
-Abby.

18:04.170 --> 18:05.301
I'll see you tonight?

18:06.346 --> 18:07.129
Maybe.

18:17.705 --> 18:19.228
You wanna tell me
what all went down?

18:20.011 --> 18:21.230
We don't know.

18:21.317 --> 18:22.971
One minute,
Todd's washing pans,

18:23.058 --> 18:26.017
-the next...
-He's yellin' about a snake.

18:27.280 --> 18:29.543
Puts his hand in the disposal.

18:29.630 --> 18:31.327
What could make a man
do something like that?

18:32.676 --> 18:33.982
Liz, you okay?

18:36.245 --> 18:38.247
We're all in one piece
but pretty far from okay.

18:39.422 --> 18:40.249
I'll be in touch.

18:45.733 --> 18:48.170
[Abby] What can I do to help?

18:48.257 --> 18:50.825
Explain to me how a kid
I've known since he was
in diapers

18:50.912 --> 18:52.957
could go ballistic and
cut himself up
in my dad's kitchen.

18:53.044 --> 18:54.437
Liz, there are--

18:54.524 --> 18:55.830
Don't tell me it doesn't
have something to do

18:55.917 --> 18:57.701
with that bullshit
coming off the water.

18:57.788 --> 18:58.876
You think he brought
something back from
the swamp?

18:58.963 --> 19:00.922
That's why I called you.

19:01.009 --> 19:02.967
Todd was out there.

19:03.054 --> 19:04.621
This green flu kicks up.

19:04.708 --> 19:06.319
Your scientist friend
coming back from the dead?

19:06.406 --> 19:07.711
Yes, but that doesn't mean
that can be a strain...

19:07.798 --> 19:09.191
I mean, we can be looking
at a neurotoxin,

19:09.278 --> 19:10.714
a round-worm,
there are a lot of other--

19:10.801 --> 19:11.541
That can make him tear
himself up like that?

19:18.809 --> 19:20.420
Oh, not again.

19:31.909 --> 19:33.172
[laughter]

19:34.129 --> 19:35.826
[woman] No! No!

19:35.913 --> 19:36.740
Pops?

19:37.741 --> 19:39.395
[woman] No!

19:39.482 --> 19:40.918
Pops, what's going on?

19:42.877 --> 19:43.704
Hello?

19:44.661 --> 19:45.706
[thug] Where's the money?

19:47.273 --> 19:48.099
[startled yelp]

19:51.277 --> 19:52.408
Oh, God.

19:53.235 --> 19:54.062
[whispering voice]

19:55.585 --> 19:56.369
Liz?

19:57.500 --> 19:58.588
Oh, no.

19:59.459 --> 20:00.808
Mama!

20:00.895 --> 20:03.071
[thug 2] Get him.

20:03.158 --> 20:04.594
-[crying]
-[thug] Kill him!

20:10.339 --> 20:11.993
-[thug] Where's the money?
-[screams]

20:12.080 --> 20:12.950
[thug] Where's the money?

20:13.037 --> 20:14.125
Get away from me!

20:14.213 --> 20:15.214
[thug] Kill the mom.

20:16.389 --> 20:17.520
Get back!

20:17.607 --> 20:18.434
-[Abby] Liz! Liz!
-[Delroy screams]

20:18.521 --> 20:19.130
Delroy, put the gun down!

20:20.958 --> 20:22.786
Pops, what're you doing?
There's nobody here!

20:23.961 --> 20:24.875
You bastards!

20:24.962 --> 20:26.747
Get back! Get back!

20:26.834 --> 20:27.965
[thug] You are dead, kid.

20:28.052 --> 20:30.054
[shotgun fires]

20:30.141 --> 20:31.273
-[Abby] Delroy,
put the gun down!
-[gun cocks]

20:34.145 --> 20:35.016
[thug muttering
indistinct threats]

20:35.103 --> 20:36.887
Get back! Get back!

20:36.974 --> 20:37.758
Get away from me!

20:37.845 --> 20:38.672
[shoots]

20:40.108 --> 20:41.414
[thug laughing]

20:41.501 --> 20:43.067
Get back!
Get away from her!

20:43.154 --> 20:44.678
I see you, goddamn it!

20:44.765 --> 20:45.809
[shoots]

20:45.896 --> 20:47.202
-Delroy!
-[gun cocks]

20:47.289 --> 20:49.160
[Liz] What are you doing?
Stop!

20:49.248 --> 20:50.945
Get away! Come on!

20:51.032 --> 20:52.555
Delroy, put the gun down.

20:52.642 --> 20:54.253
Get away from me!

20:54.340 --> 20:55.384
There's nothing here!
Put the gun down!

20:55.471 --> 20:56.864
There's no one here.

20:56.951 --> 20:57.734
Lizzy, if he doesn't
put the gun down...

20:57.821 --> 20:59.475
Lucilia, no! Wait! Stop!

21:03.044 --> 21:05.438
-[Liz] Wait! Just wait!
-[empty gun clicking]

21:05.525 --> 21:07.744
[thug] I'll come back
and kill you.

21:09.877 --> 21:11.531
[both grunting]

21:11.618 --> 21:13.707
No! No! Pops!

21:16.753 --> 21:18.059
[Delroy grunting]

21:18.146 --> 21:18.973
[Liz] Stop!

21:19.974 --> 21:21.192
[Abby] Liz.

21:21.280 --> 21:22.803
[Delroy]
I can't let them hurt her!

21:22.890 --> 21:26.372
-[Delroy groans]
-[Abby] You're okay.

21:26.459 --> 21:28.852
-[panting]
-[Abby] You're okay.

21:33.292 --> 21:34.423
Son of a bitch.

21:36.904 --> 21:37.861
Delroy.

21:39.646 --> 21:40.951
This is Sheriff Cable.

21:41.038 --> 21:43.258
I need another ambulance
at my location.

21:43.345 --> 21:44.868
Abby, what the hell
is going on?

21:47.131 --> 21:48.698
[Avery]
Always liked that blue number.

21:50.265 --> 21:53.486
It's a party.
Not a fire drill, Maria.

21:53.573 --> 21:56.227
Participation
is not mandatory.

21:56.315 --> 22:00.536
I'm sorry, I just...
keep thinking about
that little girl Susie and

22:00.623 --> 22:03.583
how she lost her father
in the swamp.

22:03.670 --> 22:04.453
Yeah.

22:05.367 --> 22:06.629
Worst part's still ahead.

22:09.110 --> 22:11.242
You know, I was
just a little older
than her when

22:12.505 --> 22:14.028
my old man passed.

22:14.115 --> 22:17.510
Seeing that little girl,

22:17.597 --> 22:20.339
knowing what her life's
gonna be like without
her folks...

22:21.731 --> 22:23.385
It all came back.

22:23.472 --> 22:25.256
How the swamp took
my old man.

22:27.607 --> 22:29.304
The hard years after.

22:29.391 --> 22:31.045
[Maria] You did all right
for yourself, Avery.

22:31.132 --> 22:33.308
You know,
you lose your father
when you're young,

22:33.395 --> 22:35.876
you spend your whole life
trying to measure up

22:36.920 --> 22:38.226
and mostly comin' up short.

22:39.270 --> 22:40.097
So...

22:42.665 --> 22:46.408
I mean, today brought up
some old baggage for me,
I guess. [chuckles]

22:48.584 --> 22:49.672
Can you zip me up?

22:51.108 --> 22:51.935
Glad to.

22:53.720 --> 22:55.765
And uh...

22:55.852 --> 23:00.379
I'm so sorry Abby has
kicked up these ugly
memories for you, honey.

23:02.511 --> 23:04.600
That's very sweet
of you, Avery.

23:20.007 --> 23:20.790
[Delroy] Lizzy?

23:22.313 --> 23:23.576
I'm here.

23:23.663 --> 23:24.446
[groans softly]

23:25.882 --> 23:27.014
Tell me I didn't hurt anyone.

23:28.711 --> 23:31.105
The walls and windows
need some love,

23:31.192 --> 23:32.585
but the people are all fine.

23:35.501 --> 23:38.460
Do you remember
what happened right before?

23:38.547 --> 23:41.724
All of a sudden,
the place got dark.

23:41.811 --> 23:44.510
Like I was stepping
into a living nightmare.

23:44.597 --> 23:45.989
It was the break-in again,
sweetie.

23:47.861 --> 23:50.124
Break-in at the Roadhouse?

23:50.211 --> 23:52.996
When I was 12,
masked men broke in.

23:53.083 --> 23:55.303
-[woman screaming]
-[evil laughter]

23:55.390 --> 23:57.827
Grandma stood up to them.
So they killed her right there.

23:59.394 --> 24:01.178
Never found out who did it.

24:07.010 --> 24:10.361
Had nightmares for years
but never nothin' like this.

24:11.362 --> 24:12.625
Not while I was awake.

24:14.757 --> 24:16.629
Todd told you he was
in the water last night.

24:16.716 --> 24:17.847
Did he tell you where?

24:19.066 --> 24:21.024
Pokin' around Ochee Forks.

24:23.331 --> 24:26.029
Something must've happened
because he said he was never
goin' back.

24:31.687 --> 24:32.471
Okay.

24:33.733 --> 24:34.864
Get some rest.

24:34.951 --> 24:35.735
All right.

24:43.220 --> 24:44.613
What are you thinking?

24:44.700 --> 24:48.008
Alec told me that
he could sense this danger

24:48.095 --> 24:49.183
in the swamp.

24:50.924 --> 24:52.795
I mean, one thing
that was drilled into us

24:52.882 --> 24:54.536
from med school on,
is stick to science.

24:54.623 --> 24:56.059
In the end, that's what's
gonna give you answers.

24:56.146 --> 24:57.713
But what's going on
here is...

25:01.587 --> 25:03.023
What are you gonna do?

25:03.110 --> 25:05.199
I'm gonna go try
and find the source.

25:05.286 --> 25:06.853
This thing, whatever it is,
is being transmitted from
person-to-person.

25:06.940 --> 25:09.203
So, it's gotta come
from somewhere.

26:01.081 --> 26:02.430
[branches creaking]

26:03.474 --> 26:05.912
[branches creaking]

26:08.001 --> 26:09.480
-[Abby] Alec?
-[rustling]

26:15.661 --> 26:16.487
Alec?

26:44.428 --> 26:45.908
-[branches creaking]
-[gasps]

26:48.868 --> 26:49.956
Alec, is that you?

27:01.837 --> 27:02.621
Oh, my God!

27:03.534 --> 27:04.361
Jesus.

27:32.607 --> 27:38.569
[phone camera clicking]

27:41.094 --> 27:42.835
[Swamp Thing]
You shouldn't have come.

27:42.922 --> 27:43.705
[Abby gasps]

27:45.054 --> 27:46.534
Alec.

27:46.621 --> 27:48.144
How did you know
I was here?

27:48.231 --> 27:49.058
I felt it.

27:50.799 --> 27:52.148
There's a darkness here.

27:54.107 --> 27:55.717
-A darkness?
-Yes.

27:57.284 --> 27:58.589
Is it connected
to this body?

27:59.590 --> 28:00.417
It was.

28:02.245 --> 28:04.073
But it's been released.

28:04.160 --> 28:06.597
Two men came here last night
and one of them was driven

28:06.685 --> 28:08.904
to take his life
because of fear.

28:08.991 --> 28:10.645
The same thing could've
happened to him.

28:10.732 --> 28:12.255
He died afraid.

28:17.086 --> 28:20.263
Ancient viruses have been
found lying dormant
in mummified tissue.

28:21.221 --> 28:22.265
It isn't a disease.

28:23.789 --> 28:25.051
The swamp, it...

28:26.052 --> 28:28.228
changes things.

28:28.315 --> 28:30.404
If the organism that came
from his body has been
in the swamp for years,

28:30.491 --> 28:32.058
then it could
still be out there.

28:32.145 --> 28:34.364
The darkness always
seeks a new host.

28:34.451 --> 28:36.062
Another victim.

28:36.149 --> 28:36.932
Another host.

28:40.501 --> 28:42.459
Todd scratched Delroy,
and Delroy...

28:47.421 --> 28:50.424
Oh, my God.
Lucilia could be infected.

28:50.511 --> 28:53.209
I'm sorry. Look,
I have to get back to Marais.

28:53.296 --> 28:54.123
Abby.

28:56.125 --> 28:57.474
This... thing...

28:59.520 --> 29:01.130
belongs here in the swamp.

29:09.051 --> 29:11.097
[Avery] Everybody ready
to have a good time?

29:11.184 --> 29:13.752
-[all cheering]
-[country music playing]

29:19.366 --> 29:21.542
How'd I do?

29:21.629 --> 29:23.631
Oh, you're always good
at reminding people all
you've done for them.

29:23.718 --> 29:27.287
Always nice to let people
know who's buttering
the bread, or the...

29:27.374 --> 29:29.985
crawfish as the case
may be.

29:31.378 --> 29:33.467
What's Susie Coyle doing here?

29:33.554 --> 29:34.860
Oh, I thought
she might enjoy it.

29:34.947 --> 29:36.905
Her uncle's been
having a hard time,

29:36.992 --> 29:40.996
and I said we might take
little Susie for a night
or a couple of days.

29:41.083 --> 29:43.607
-[Avery] I know I should've--
-No, no, it sounds good.

29:43.694 --> 29:45.218
Hello. Hello, Susie.

29:45.305 --> 29:47.437
I see you've met Nadine.

29:47.524 --> 29:49.178
Why don't we grab some food?

29:49.265 --> 29:51.137
I've got a room over there.
We'll all get acquainted.

29:51.224 --> 29:52.791
-What do you say, little Susie?
-Okay.

29:52.878 --> 29:54.357
[all laugh]

30:02.235 --> 30:03.018
Daniel.

30:05.194 --> 30:06.630
How did you know
it was me?

30:09.590 --> 30:10.852
What is it you want?

30:18.686 --> 30:20.079
Have you seen anything more?

30:21.558 --> 30:24.866
About my... mission,
whatever it is?

30:24.953 --> 30:25.867
I've been busy.

30:27.913 --> 30:29.915
Come on, Ms. X.

30:30.002 --> 30:32.526
You just try,
maybe you get a hint.

30:32.613 --> 30:34.180
The truth is, Daniel,

30:34.267 --> 30:37.357
the cards aren't clear
right now.

30:37.444 --> 30:39.881
Not just about you.

30:39.968 --> 30:42.318
About the future
of this entire town.

30:42.405 --> 30:44.451
What?

30:44.538 --> 30:46.061
Are you saying
you lost your gift?

30:46.975 --> 30:51.023
All I know now is...

30:51.110 --> 30:53.460
a storm is coming, Daniel.

30:53.547 --> 30:56.767
Something big.

30:56.855 --> 31:01.033
Something that will
affect the destiny of
this entire town,

31:01.120 --> 31:02.338
and everyone in it.

31:05.820 --> 31:07.561
Something terrible is coming.

31:07.648 --> 31:11.086
And this is when
my cards change?

31:11.173 --> 31:13.349
Eight years ago,
when you'd first
come to Marais,

31:13.436 --> 31:14.785
you told me
you'd made a bargain.

31:17.136 --> 31:21.270
One that bound you to
this town until called upon.

31:21.836 --> 31:23.925
Right.

31:24.012 --> 31:26.841
When the shit comes down,
whatever it is,

31:29.061 --> 31:30.714
you're gonna be here
to help, right?

31:33.108 --> 31:33.892
If I can.

31:35.850 --> 31:37.765
But you've been called
to a destiny.

31:39.810 --> 31:42.596
Every hero's path
is theirs to walk alone.

32:01.528 --> 32:02.703
-Hey.
-Hey.

32:08.187 --> 32:09.710
I couldn't believe your call.

32:09.797 --> 32:11.407
You think Lucilia's next?

32:11.494 --> 32:13.235
I saw Delroy scratch her.

32:13.322 --> 32:14.976
And that's how
it's transmitted, Liz,

32:15.063 --> 32:17.196
from one infected person
to the next through blood.

32:17.283 --> 32:20.503
It's... It's nothing like
I've ever seen before. I...

32:21.896 --> 32:23.985
Did the name on that key
mean anything?

32:24.072 --> 32:28.598
The Echo did a retrospective
on 1930's Marais a while back.

32:28.685 --> 32:30.818
The Hotel Esperos was
a local boarding house.

32:30.905 --> 32:32.994
And some very strange shit
went down there.

32:34.996 --> 32:36.389
What?

32:36.476 --> 32:38.434
The first incident was
a World War I vet.

32:38.521 --> 32:40.915
They found him on his boat
raving about dirt caving in
on him,

32:41.002 --> 32:42.786
like he was back
in the trenches.

32:42.873 --> 32:44.571
Like his own
personal nightmare.

32:44.658 --> 32:46.616
After he came back to
the hotel, locals reported

32:46.703 --> 32:49.793
hearing screams and
seeing strange behavior.

32:49.880 --> 32:52.840
But it was spreading so fast
the authorities had no clue
what to do.

32:52.927 --> 32:54.363
So he must've passed it
on to someone else,

32:54.450 --> 32:56.322
and then it just went
from person to person.

32:56.409 --> 32:57.845
When did it stop?

32:57.932 --> 33:00.543
The last victim just
flipped out and vanished.

33:00.630 --> 33:03.372
Weeks later, they found
his boat drifting near
Ochee Forks.

33:03.459 --> 33:04.983
I wonder if he knew
he had the infection.

33:05.070 --> 33:06.375
So he went to the swamp
and killed himself

33:06.462 --> 33:08.508
so he wouldn't pass it on
to anyone else.

33:08.595 --> 33:09.857
Until Todd came along.

33:16.603 --> 33:18.822
[country music playing]

33:32.227 --> 33:34.664
You working the room, Ma?

33:34.751 --> 33:38.190
[distorted] Why can't you ever
just enjoy yourself, hmm?

33:38.277 --> 33:39.756
That's the reason why.

33:42.759 --> 33:43.891
[Matt] I'll take care of it.

33:46.720 --> 33:49.505
Hey! Knock it off!

33:49.592 --> 33:50.376
[boy] Get in there.

33:51.159 --> 33:52.769
[screams] Matt!

33:52.856 --> 33:54.162
[boy] Fuck him up.

33:54.249 --> 33:55.033
Matt!

34:02.823 --> 34:04.390
-[cries] Matty! No!
-[coughs]

34:06.479 --> 34:09.743
10-33, officer down!
I need an ambulance!

34:09.830 --> 34:13.834
Oh, baby don't!
No! Mama says no!

34:13.921 --> 34:15.879
Matty! Look at me.
Look at me.

34:15.966 --> 34:17.185
Matty!

34:17.272 --> 34:18.273
Open your eyes!

34:18.926 --> 34:19.970
No!

34:20.797 --> 34:22.669
Matty!

34:22.756 --> 34:24.279
Matty, stay with me.

34:26.890 --> 34:27.717
Matty!

34:29.284 --> 34:30.068
Lucilia!

34:32.896 --> 34:33.767
[Lucilia] Stay back!

34:35.160 --> 34:36.987
-Stay back!
-[crowd screams]

34:37.075 --> 34:38.119
-Lucilia!
-Stay back!

34:39.990 --> 34:41.557
-Stay away!
-Lucilia!

34:41.644 --> 34:42.993
It's okay.

34:43.081 --> 34:45.213
-Stay back!
-Lucilia! Listen to me!

34:45.300 --> 34:47.650
Stay back! I will blast
that fucking smile

34:47.737 --> 34:49.130
right off your fucking face!

34:49.217 --> 34:50.305
It's not real.
It's not real!

34:51.524 --> 34:53.265
-Stay back!
-Lucilia!

34:53.352 --> 34:55.049
[Abby] Matty is okay.

34:55.136 --> 34:57.791
Lucilia, look at me!
Look at me!
This is not real!

34:57.878 --> 34:59.140
-Get away!
-This is not real!

35:02.883 --> 35:04.798
You're sick.
You have to come with me.

35:04.885 --> 35:07.714
-No! Get off of me!
-Lucilia! You have to
come with me!

35:07.801 --> 35:09.019
Get off of me!

35:09.107 --> 35:11.457
You have to come with me!
Lucilia!

35:11.544 --> 35:13.459
-Lucilia!
-[grunts]

35:13.546 --> 35:14.895

35:14.982 --> 35:16.636
-Hey.
-[panting]

35:17.419 --> 35:18.246
Matty.

35:18.986 --> 35:20.205
Matty...

35:20.292 --> 35:21.684
[Matt] It's me. It's okay.

35:24.078 --> 35:26.385
-[Cassidy] Come on, Doc,
we gotta get out of here.
-No, no!

35:26.472 --> 35:28.822
-I tried to stop him.
-I'm right here.

35:28.909 --> 35:31.477
-Baby.
-Matt... Matt!

35:31.564 --> 35:32.782
Get her to the hospital.

35:32.869 --> 35:34.523
Yeah. Yeah. Come on.

35:38.223 --> 35:39.093
[Liz] Abby!

35:39.180 --> 35:41.226
Liz! Don't touch me!

35:41.313 --> 35:42.836
Liz, that thing is in me.

35:42.923 --> 35:44.185
I have to take it back
to the swamp.

35:58.852 --> 35:59.679
Alec?

36:02.682 --> 36:03.509
Alec!

[Man With No Face hissing]
Abby...

36:36.629 --> 36:38.892
I've been waiting.

36:38.979 --> 36:43.418
Your mommy tried
to take you from me,

36:45.507 --> 36:50.164
but I'm still in your dreams.

36:50.251 --> 36:53.211
You thought they ended
when she died.

36:53.298 --> 36:54.299
[cries out]

36:54.386 --> 36:57.824
That I was gone forever!

36:57.911 --> 37:01.915
-[screams]
-But you are still
just a scared little girl,

37:02.002 --> 37:05.223
trying to hide
from your past.

37:07.181 --> 37:09.749
Don't fight it!

37:09.836 --> 37:14.754
-[screaming]
-Your mother wants
to see you.

37:14.841 --> 37:18.410
You wanted to understand
the darkness.

37:18.497 --> 37:20.760
I'll show you!

37:21.326 --> 37:22.283

38:34.921 --> 38:37.184
[branches creaking]

38:40.143 --> 38:42.145
[Swamp Thing]
He died to protect
the ones he loved.

38:44.104 --> 38:46.106
The darkness was never
meant to leave him.

38:46.802 --> 38:48.108
He took it back.

38:49.588 --> 38:51.329
And now this place
has taken him.

39:03.645 --> 39:05.778
I don't understand.
How do you know all of this?

39:09.956 --> 39:12.262
The plants, the trees...

39:13.829 --> 39:15.570
I think they're talking to me.

39:21.315 --> 39:23.099
Maria, I just
got off the phone.

39:23.186 --> 39:26.712
Seems our sheriff
came down with a bad case
of food poisoning.

39:26.799 --> 39:28.670
-High fever.
-Mmm.

39:28.757 --> 39:30.759
She went off with Matt.

39:30.846 --> 39:32.282
To have the doctors
take a look.

39:33.545 --> 39:35.111
She seems happy here.

39:35.198 --> 39:37.592
[Avery exhales]

39:37.679 --> 39:41.509
[Avery] It'd be nice...
to have a child
in the house again, huh?

39:42.728 --> 39:43.511
You know...

39:45.034 --> 39:47.950
I was thinking...

39:48.037 --> 39:51.911
Her uncle and his wife
already have four kids
of their own.

39:51.998 --> 39:54.130
Taking another one on would
stretch them pretty thin.

39:56.002 --> 39:57.786
You're thinking
she should stay here?

39:59.571 --> 40:00.615
I could ask.

40:02.182 --> 40:05.272
I just hope to God
she's okay.

40:05.359 --> 40:08.710
You know, the CDC raced
out of here pretty quick
in my opinion.

40:10.364 --> 40:12.932
-Well, if I had--
-They left Abby.

40:13.019 --> 40:16.457
Clearly they don't
understand this green flu.

40:16.544 --> 40:19.982
That's why I'm keeping
Dr. Woodrue on the payroll.

40:20.069 --> 40:23.595
He's the only person
who could find a real cure
for this thing,

40:23.682 --> 40:25.161
make sure she's okay.

40:28.513 --> 40:29.818
Oh, what I mean...

40:29.905 --> 40:32.299
I'm sure that
she is gonna be fine.

40:39.480 --> 40:41.526
[Lee] How's Susie?

40:41.613 --> 40:43.353
[Avery]
What do you care, Coyle?

40:52.711 --> 40:53.973
It's made out to cash.

40:55.888 --> 40:58.325
Better take it to
a big bank in the city.

41:02.982 --> 41:04.679
So what's this
really about, Sunderland?

41:05.985 --> 41:07.377
Buying a kid like this?

41:11.817 --> 41:13.949
You don't love
that little girl.

41:14.036 --> 41:18.650
You know those commercials
that they run asking for
donations,

41:18.737 --> 41:22.349
to help some poor
starving child overseas?

41:22.436 --> 41:27.659
There's a reason they don't
put those on the radio.

41:27.746 --> 41:30.357
See, if you want
people to pony up,

41:30.444 --> 41:35.362
they have to see
those sad, sick orphans,

41:35.449 --> 41:38.017
in order to open
their checkbooks.

41:38.104 --> 41:42.500
And Dr. Woodrue is gonna
get everything he needs

41:42.587 --> 41:46.068
to make sure
little Susie is all right.

41:52.161 --> 41:53.423
Hey, you have
a good night, Lee.

41:55.774 --> 41:57.689
Don't spend it all
in a bar.

42:06.349 --> 42:08.047
[Abby] I'm not
giving up on you.

42:08.134 --> 42:09.831
I'm going to find an answer.

42:15.924 --> 42:17.186
The darkness...

42:17.273 --> 42:18.318
made you afraid.

42:19.798 --> 42:22.061
What did you see?

42:22.148 --> 42:25.455
I saw something
I thought I'd forgotten.

42:25.543 --> 42:29.242
When I was a little girl,
I would wake up crying
almost every night,

42:29.329 --> 42:32.462
scared that this, uh...

42:32.550 --> 42:36.902
This faceless monster was
gonna come and tear me
away from my mother.

42:36.989 --> 42:38.773
When she died,
the nightmares stopped.

42:38.860 --> 42:43.778
But when I was little,
it was, uh...
it was very real.

42:43.865 --> 42:46.215
I'm a doctor, Alec.
You are a biologist.

42:46.302 --> 42:47.913
I...

42:48.000 --> 42:50.089
Tell me how any of this
makes sense.

42:50.176 --> 42:51.743
It doesn't.

42:51.830 --> 42:53.919
Not in any way that
we used to understand.

42:54.006 --> 42:56.530
So this darkness...

42:56.617 --> 42:57.531
Where does it come from?

42:57.618 --> 42:59.228
The swamp's been polluted.

42:59.315 --> 43:00.142
Poisoned.

43:01.709 --> 43:04.582
And when the balance shifts,
life suffers,

43:04.669 --> 43:07.454
-and darkness finds release...
-...bringing death.

43:07.541 --> 43:08.368
Yes.

43:11.980 --> 43:14.113
How am I seeing
these things?

43:14.200 --> 43:16.332
I don't know
who I am anymore, Abby.

43:17.203 --> 43:18.813
You're Alec Holland.

43:21.033 --> 43:22.077
You're my friend.

43:28.431 --> 43:29.607
I'm scared for you, Abby.

43:33.436 --> 43:34.786
This is only the beginning.
