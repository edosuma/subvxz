03:42.704 --> 03:46.106
- What are you doing here, Dale?
- Sorry for the house call.

03:46.108 --> 03:47.643
It's after midnight.

03:48.110 --> 03:49.544
Just got off
my shift.

03:50.612 --> 03:51.780
Well?

03:52.814 --> 03:54.983
Uh, you got any Oxy?

03:57.619 --> 03:58.854
Not for months.

03:59.755 --> 04:01.657
Aw, shit.

04:02.658 --> 04:05.194
- You out and out?
- Yeah, I've been out.

04:09.665 --> 04:12.434
No, whoa! Okay.
Okay.

04:13.602 --> 04:14.670
All right. Come on.

04:19.075 --> 04:22.209
How long has it been like this?

04:22.211 --> 04:23.947
Uh, a couple weeks.

04:24.814 --> 04:26.716
Happened when I was
back home for the season.

04:27.050 --> 04:30.720
I can wrap you up, but you're
gonna need to go to the hospital.

04:31.187 --> 04:33.688
Tried. They made me wait
six hours.

04:33.690 --> 04:35.990
By then it was time
to start my shift.

04:35.992 --> 04:38.793
Well, next time
wait seven.

04:38.795 --> 04:39.963
Till then?

04:40.930 --> 04:43.233
I really don't have
anything for you, Dale.

04:46.769 --> 04:47.804
Why'd you stop?

04:50.773 --> 04:53.808
I got caught on the border
with my mom's meds.

04:53.810 --> 04:54.878
No Oxy?

04:55.545 --> 04:56.546
No.

04:56.947 --> 04:58.048
Nothin' nowhere?

04:59.183 --> 05:00.217
Nowhere.

05:01.218 --> 05:02.886
Wouldn't tell me,
would ya?

05:04.321 --> 05:06.288
I got 10 days left
on my probation

05:06.290 --> 05:08.924
and the last thing I need
to do is implicate myself

05:08.926 --> 05:11.093
in a worse crime than
I got caught committing.

05:11.095 --> 05:12.496
So...

05:13.897 --> 05:15.232
no, I wouldn't.

05:16.967 --> 05:19.837
Keep it elevated,
stay off of it,

05:20.804 --> 05:23.141
and go to the hospital,
okay?

05:25.176 --> 05:27.245
Sorry
I couldn't do more.

05:28.313 --> 05:29.981
I get it.

05:30.881 --> 05:35.051
It's a shame though. Bill's selling
for a lot more than you did.

05:35.053 --> 05:36.754
That's 'cause
he's a drug dealer.

06:32.044 --> 06:34.213
Mommy!

06:35.315 --> 06:36.916
You're okay, Bear.

06:39.051 --> 06:41.051
Oh...

06:41.053 --> 06:43.687
You're okay. Get it all out.

06:43.689 --> 06:45.791
Oh, yeah.
Get it all out.

06:49.762 --> 06:51.198
You're okay, Bear.

06:52.332 --> 06:53.732
You're okay.

06:58.939 --> 06:59.973
You all done?

07:01.174 --> 07:03.176
You're okay, Bear.
All right?

09:00.263 --> 09:01.464
Hey.

09:02.832 --> 09:05.399
I don't know what's better,
seeing you or seeing clean laundry.

09:05.401 --> 09:07.235
Yeah?

09:07.237 --> 09:09.337
I don't know why
you don't get whoever left

09:09.339 --> 09:12.809
that lipstick on your nice
shirt to do it for you.

09:14.345 --> 09:16.143
It'd be a lot cheaper.

09:16.145 --> 09:17.180
Maybe so.

09:20.049 --> 09:22.351
- Can I get two coffees?
- Yeah.

09:22.353 --> 09:25.320
Hey, I forgot the creamer today,
so you'll have to take it black.

09:25.322 --> 09:26.523
- I hope that's okay.
- All right.

09:27.258 --> 09:29.558
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

09:29.560 --> 09:32.427
- The usual, please.
- Yeah? Did you find a place yet?

09:32.429 --> 09:34.296
- No. Still staying in the truck.
- Yeah?

09:34.298 --> 09:36.398
Well, at least
it's warmed up a little bit

09:36.400 --> 09:38.402
- instead of being so freaking cold.
- Yeah.

09:39.870 --> 09:43.606
- Good old steak and eggs, huh?
- Thank you.

09:43.608 --> 09:46.241
- Yeah. Okay.
- Let me have two. I'm gonna take one back to Jeff.

09:46.243 --> 09:48.410
- Jeff is your secret lover, right?
- Nah.

09:48.412 --> 09:50.112
- No?
- Keep the change.

09:50.114 --> 09:51.215
All right.

10:14.072 --> 10:16.574
- How are you doin', Bill?
- Good, Ollie. How are you?

10:17.242 --> 10:18.943
I'm fine, Bill.

10:20.345 --> 10:22.113
Heard Dale made
a house visit.

10:24.115 --> 10:26.017
- Who?
- Funny.

10:26.418 --> 10:27.986
You were always funny.

10:31.289 --> 10:32.924
What can I do for you?

10:34.460 --> 10:36.427
He just got
back to town.

10:36.429 --> 10:39.363
And he had no idea that
I wasn't selling anymore.

10:39.365 --> 10:41.534
Could be, couldn't you,
if you wanted.

10:43.001 --> 10:45.371
He mentioned you had a
foreclosure notice on your door.

10:46.372 --> 10:48.107
Not like you couldn't use
the money.

10:51.477 --> 10:53.245
We'd make great partners.

10:56.182 --> 10:57.450
I'm not interested.

11:02.154 --> 11:05.224
If you change your mind,
let me know?

11:11.163 --> 11:14.066
So did he buy
from you then? Dale.

11:16.670 --> 11:18.204
Well, he's working today.

11:43.530 --> 11:46.732
I've been applying
for something normal,

11:46.734 --> 11:49.635
you know, so I can stop all
the odd jobs and whatnot.

11:49.637 --> 11:52.337
All legal, of course.

11:52.339 --> 11:53.907
And the illegal stuff...

11:55.142 --> 11:56.878
Getting better at saying no?

11:57.578 --> 11:58.912
Yes.

12:05.686 --> 12:07.288
How's the living situation?

12:07.655 --> 12:09.056
Not great.

12:09.424 --> 12:11.190
I guess it's a good thing
that Mom passed

12:11.192 --> 12:12.527
before we got evicted.

12:13.428 --> 12:15.963
Just have me
to worry about now, so...

12:17.031 --> 12:18.166
And how is your sister?

12:18.666 --> 12:20.268
I haven't seen her much.

12:21.703 --> 12:23.104
Well, even after...

12:25.306 --> 12:26.507
Yeah.

12:30.746 --> 12:32.514
You ever think
about leaving?

12:36.485 --> 12:39.588
You know, one of the jobs that
I applied to is out in Spokane,

12:40.389 --> 12:43.090
so, I'm not just...

12:43.625 --> 12:47.229
thinking about
thinking about it anymore.

12:51.099 --> 12:55.602
Speaking of which,
I need a reference.

12:55.604 --> 12:59.007
So I was wondering if maybe...

13:01.243 --> 13:04.612
- What? Is that stupid?
- Not worried about what I'll say?

13:04.614 --> 13:07.648
- Why? What are you gonna say?
- I guess you'll find out.

13:07.650 --> 13:10.487
I know you think that that's
funny, but that's not funny.

13:11.754 --> 13:15.155
All good things.
I think this is great.

13:15.157 --> 13:16.626
A good opportunity
to start fresh.

13:20.797 --> 13:22.732
Well, your restitution
is fully paid.

13:23.600 --> 13:25.666
You've got one more check-in,
and then,

13:25.668 --> 13:28.705
in eight days,
your probation is done.

13:33.643 --> 13:35.011
Thanks.

13:36.312 --> 13:37.514
Ollie.

13:38.782 --> 13:40.684
You are so close.

13:42.653 --> 13:44.153
Please stay out of trouble.

13:55.399 --> 13:57.699
So, you thought I forgot
about that fiver you owe me,

13:57.701 --> 13:59.637
so last week I took
a pair of your socks.

13:59.870 --> 14:02.738
If you want 'em back...
You know I write shit down.

14:02.740 --> 14:05.274
- Hey, I'm Jack.
- Okay, Jack. Yeah?

14:05.276 --> 14:07.576
- You're that Oleander girl, aren't you?
- What's it to ya?

14:07.578 --> 14:09.313
Well, I need to get
across the border.

14:09.680 --> 14:12.848
My leg's getting worse,
and I can't see a doctor on this side.

14:12.850 --> 14:15.117
Excuse me. You must be
looking for someone else.

14:15.119 --> 14:16.453
I can't get work!

14:22.661 --> 14:25.229
Hey, that's ten.

14:26.263 --> 14:28.196
Thanks.

14:28.198 --> 14:30.265
Oleander King,
you must miss me something fierce.

14:30.267 --> 14:32.704
Well, if I do, Ian,
it hasn't hit me yet.

14:34.773 --> 14:37.574
- Hit you now?
- I can think of someone who might miss you,

14:37.576 --> 14:38.810
but it's not me.

14:40.745 --> 14:42.879
Hey, you been talking
to the guys about me?

14:42.881 --> 14:46.349
- What? Like how much I admire you?
- No. You know what I mean.

14:46.351 --> 14:47.752
No, of course not.

14:49.287 --> 14:51.187
Okay, 'cause I've had
some new guys ask me,

14:51.189 --> 14:52.622
and then Bill's
been on my ass. So...

14:52.624 --> 14:53.792
You and Bill, huh?

14:54.894 --> 14:56.927
Oh, shit.
You're getting the itch.

14:56.929 --> 14:58.764
- No, I'm not.
- Yeah?

14:59.664 --> 15:00.866
You'd make a killing.

15:02.167 --> 15:05.468
- Bill charges much more than you used to.
- Yeah, I heard.

15:05.470 --> 15:07.540
So if you want in,
come talk to me.

15:08.908 --> 15:11.477
Why don't you help your kid
and my sister instead?

15:23.356 --> 15:25.289
This is Oleander King
calling on behalf

15:25.291 --> 15:26.759
of Bridget Sorensen.

15:28.561 --> 15:29.595
Yes.

15:30.663 --> 15:32.198
Yeah, I'm her daughter.

15:33.432 --> 15:34.800
No, adopted. That's...

15:35.301 --> 15:36.235
Um...

15:39.372 --> 15:43.242
She, uh...
Bridget passed away, actually, so...

15:44.978 --> 15:46.379
Mm-hmm.

15:47.948 --> 15:49.348
Yeah, I have 'em.

15:54.421 --> 15:56.323
Wait, wait.
"Due-on-sale"?

15:57.591 --> 15:59.191
What... What does that mean?

16:16.510 --> 16:17.644
Come on, Bear.

16:18.913 --> 16:20.882
- Hey.
- Hey.

16:31.826 --> 16:35.027
Can I have some apple
juice, Auntie Ollie?

16:35.029 --> 16:37.265
"May I have some
apple juice, please?"

16:37.598 --> 16:39.967
- May I?
- If you eat some peas.

16:43.438 --> 16:45.805
- Squashed.
- Not with your fingers.

16:45.807 --> 16:46.841
Come on.

17:04.291 --> 17:05.728
May I be excused?

17:05.961 --> 17:07.428
Had your fill?

17:08.464 --> 17:09.964
Can you eat
a piece of chicken?

17:12.901 --> 17:13.935
Good.

17:14.569 --> 17:16.803
Okay, come on.
Want your coloring book?

17:16.805 --> 17:18.339
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay.

17:18.906 --> 17:21.276
- Say thank you.
- Thank you.

17:24.847 --> 17:28.416
You're gonna be good, right, while
I go back inside and talk to your aunt?

17:28.917 --> 17:31.085
- Yeah?
- I want my other coloring book.

17:31.087 --> 17:33.553
You want your other coloring book?
Are you gonna say "please"?

17:33.555 --> 17:36.356
Uh-huh. And I'm gonna
color you a big, fat turd.

17:45.434 --> 17:47.604
You're still sleeping
on the floor in Mom's room?

17:48.471 --> 17:50.305
I kinda got used to it.

17:51.808 --> 17:53.543
Well, what's wrong
with your room?

17:54.811 --> 17:55.979
Nothing. It's just...

17:58.381 --> 18:02.018
- What?
- Nothing.

18:13.630 --> 18:15.698
I'm interviewing
for a job out in Spokane.

18:18.035 --> 18:21.604
I'm thinking if I get it,
I'm just gonna let go of the house.

18:22.438 --> 18:25.607
So, you get this job,
you're leaving.

18:25.609 --> 18:27.410
Yeah, hopefully.

18:29.013 --> 18:31.482
You, Oleander,
are not hopeful.

18:32.416 --> 18:35.384
Practical, yeah.
Resourceful, absolutely.

18:35.386 --> 18:38.453
Y... You never hope.
You do.

18:38.455 --> 18:40.791
Well, sometimes I do
a little too much.

18:44.162 --> 18:47.798
You'll be fine. You'll get the job.
You'll get out of here.

19:05.884 --> 19:08.551
Just like old times.
Want one?

19:08.553 --> 19:11.454
Nah, I quit.
They're bad for you.

19:11.456 --> 19:13.358
I'm picking my poison.

19:26.471 --> 19:28.040
Hey, if I leave, Deb,

19:29.041 --> 19:30.809
you're gonna
have to step up.

19:31.911 --> 19:33.143
Stay out of trouble.

19:33.145 --> 19:35.447
I'm clean.
I've been clean.

19:36.916 --> 19:38.050
Good.

19:42.822 --> 19:46.058
- Look, I know this is sudden with the house...
- I'm pregnant.

19:51.030 --> 19:53.466
Well, what are you
and the guy gonna do?

19:54.934 --> 19:56.567
- It's Ian's.
- Oh, God.

19:56.569 --> 19:58.602
Well, that answers that.
What are you gonna do?

19:58.604 --> 20:01.239
Please don't. I don't need
any more of that from you.

20:01.241 --> 20:02.975
Well, what do you need
from me, Deb?

20:03.243 --> 20:04.710
Nothin'.

20:06.746 --> 20:08.846
- Well, what are you gonna do?
- I don't know.

20:08.848 --> 20:10.949
- I don't have a lot of options.
- Either you have it...

20:10.951 --> 20:12.418
Or I don't?

20:15.554 --> 20:16.922
Never mind.

20:16.924 --> 20:19.159
You know,
I'll take care of it.

20:20.127 --> 20:23.163
- What do you mean, you'll take care of it?
- Means I'll take care of it.

20:24.064 --> 20:26.700
What, with some back-alley
fix at Taylor's?

20:27.267 --> 20:29.634
You really wanna take that risk?
God, you have a kid!

20:29.636 --> 20:31.905
Johnny is exactly
why I can't.

20:34.508 --> 20:36.275
- I live in a parking lot.
- No, that was your choice.

20:36.277 --> 20:38.543
You could've lived in
the house if you wanted to.

20:38.545 --> 20:41.280
You're giving away
our house, so...

20:41.282 --> 20:44.116
- You could get seriously hurt.
- Hopefully not though, right?

20:44.118 --> 20:46.720
- No, I don't hope, right?
- You do.

20:51.993 --> 20:54.559
- Fine. You'll move in here.
- In a house we're about to lose?

20:54.561 --> 20:56.463
What if I found a way
to make some money...

20:56.931 --> 20:59.165
- It's not like I wouldn't have bills.
- But you'd have a home.

20:59.167 --> 21:02.600
An actual home. And I could help
you out once I get a real job.

21:02.602 --> 21:04.772
You want me to have
another kid?

21:06.307 --> 21:07.542
Really?

21:08.176 --> 21:10.011
I want you to be okay.

21:10.244 --> 21:11.245
Yeah.

21:12.013 --> 21:13.681
'Cause you're leaving.

21:16.217 --> 21:17.919
Yeah.

21:19.887 --> 21:21.789
Where are you gonna get
the money, Ollie?

21:24.326 --> 21:26.095
I'll figure something out.

22:18.048 --> 22:20.181
Your hair's longer.

22:20.183 --> 22:21.785
Yours is too.

22:23.119 --> 22:25.822
- I miss you sometimes.
- Yeah?

22:26.890 --> 22:28.591
I miss you
all the time.

22:32.228 --> 22:35.865
You're tired.
Close your eyes.

22:39.769 --> 22:41.836
Are you sleepy?

22:41.838 --> 22:43.140
Yes.

22:44.641 --> 22:46.009
Me too.

23:05.229 --> 23:06.962
All right.

23:06.964 --> 23:10.232
So that is $5,682 due

23:10.234 --> 23:12.837
to turn the home over
to Deborah Hale.

23:13.904 --> 23:16.173
- And when would that be due?
- In one week.

23:16.874 --> 23:17.975
One...

23:19.211 --> 23:22.044
We've sent many notices
of the foreclosure to your home.

23:22.046 --> 23:24.114
Yeah,
I understand.

23:24.116 --> 23:26.282
But is there something that
we could maybe work out?

23:26.284 --> 23:29.018
I'm sorry. It's been a rough
time for a lot of people.

23:29.020 --> 23:32.355
Yeah. And here we are,
trying to keep the one thing that we have

23:32.357 --> 23:34.092
that nobody else
is gonna want.

23:34.459 --> 23:36.692
Trust me.
If you saw the house,

23:36.694 --> 23:38.163
you'd pay us to keep it.

23:40.298 --> 23:44.002
Can you let us just
give you half the money?

23:45.270 --> 23:46.938
Please?

23:53.412 --> 23:54.846
I'll see what I can do.

24:01.220 --> 24:02.288
I hate begging.

24:03.422 --> 24:05.788
Yeah, it doesn't
exactly float my boat either,

24:05.790 --> 24:07.792
but three grand would be
better than six.

24:08.827 --> 24:10.963
Might as well be 50,000.

24:12.165 --> 24:14.331
Money is money is money
when you ain't got it.

24:14.333 --> 24:15.434
Yeah.

24:21.974 --> 24:24.341
If you can get us half
the total mortgage in one week,

24:24.343 --> 24:27.246
we can redistribute
the rest across future payments.

24:27.813 --> 24:29.146
That's great.

24:29.148 --> 24:31.182
Yeah.
Thank you so much.

24:31.184 --> 24:32.452
You're welcome.

25:12.259 --> 25:14.926
- Oh, Jesus Christ.
- Oh, somebody's late for work.

25:14.928 --> 25:16.795
- What do you want?
- What do I want?

25:16.797 --> 25:19.198
- Come on, bud.
- Oh, what's up, little man?

25:19.200 --> 25:20.301
Come say hi to Daddy.

25:22.370 --> 25:24.370
Oh!

25:24.372 --> 25:26.205
Oh, Jesus, he's drunk.

25:26.207 --> 25:29.141
Are you sick too?

25:29.143 --> 25:32.878
Am I sick? No, I'm not sick.

25:32.880 --> 25:35.350
Okay, let's get you inside.

25:40.021 --> 25:42.555
- What?
- Leave. Leave.

25:42.557 --> 25:45.057
- What, I can't hang out with my son?
- Not like this.

25:45.059 --> 25:46.593
Oh, but you can
ask me for money?

25:46.595 --> 25:48.963
- Yes.
- Shit.

25:49.197 --> 25:52.098
What are you feeding the little guy?
He looks like he's starving.

25:52.100 --> 25:55.935
Starving? Well, I'll put him on your
diet, nothing but beer.

25:55.937 --> 25:59.941
Hope he grows up big and strong and
fucking worthless like his daddy.

26:02.278 --> 26:04.012
You're a bad mom.

26:09.385 --> 26:12.452
Okay. I got that money
you begged me for.

26:12.454 --> 26:15.088
- I didn't beg you for shit!
- Uh-huh. You should be thanking me.

26:15.090 --> 26:16.923
- I don't want it.
- That's what you should be doing.

26:16.925 --> 26:19.561
- You begged me for it!
- Fuck off! Get out!

26:20.929 --> 26:23.230
Go! Leave!
You're a joke!

26:23.232 --> 26:25.568
You're a fucking joke!

26:42.252 --> 26:46.122
Hey, hey, hey. No, no, no.
Stop. You need that!

26:47.324 --> 26:48.558
Hey.

26:49.159 --> 26:50.360
Hey!

26:51.494 --> 26:53.096
You're good.

26:54.197 --> 26:55.465
Okay?

26:56.199 --> 26:57.334
Come on.

27:00.036 --> 27:01.371
Johnny?

27:13.451 --> 27:15.453
- Here you go, sir.
- Thank you.

28:13.979 --> 28:16.314
Are you okay?

28:18.083 --> 28:21.719
Yeah. Yeah.

28:21.721 --> 28:23.021
I'm okay.

28:23.522 --> 28:24.923
Sure?

28:27.259 --> 28:28.561
Are you okay?

28:42.542 --> 28:44.444
You ever heard
about knockin'?

28:45.411 --> 28:48.314
What? Here to tell me
what a piece of shit I am?

28:51.651 --> 28:53.986
You said if I wanted back in,
to come see you.

28:54.787 --> 28:57.423
- Why?
- I thought you were here for Deb.

29:00.126 --> 29:01.494
I am.

29:06.165 --> 29:07.501
Well, answer the question.

29:10.169 --> 29:12.704
- You want back in?
- Are you sellin'?

29:12.706 --> 29:14.307
I know who's buying,

29:14.608 --> 29:17.409
here in Little Woods,
Tioga, Watford City.

29:17.411 --> 29:20.112
So you can move,
say, 500 pills?

29:22.114 --> 29:24.451
What, you really have a bag
buried in the woods?

29:28.455 --> 29:31.158
Five hundred pills.
We partners?

29:33.060 --> 29:35.162
Mm...

29:35.596 --> 29:39.498
Look, you tell people the price, and you don't
say my name, you don't say Little Woods,

29:39.500 --> 29:41.801
you don't say anything to
anybody about where you got 'em.

29:41.803 --> 29:44.704
- That's it.
- Okay. But I don't sell.

29:44.706 --> 29:48.273
- You don't or you won't?
- No, listen. You was the one who was good at it.

29:48.275 --> 29:51.343
You knew how to deal. And you weren't
wasting your time out in Brandon

29:51.345 --> 29:54.413
giving people prescriptions,
you were getting shit done.

29:54.415 --> 29:57.383
So, like I said,
I know who's buying.

29:57.385 --> 29:58.786
I will set you up.

29:59.521 --> 30:01.021
But you gotta sell.

30:01.856 --> 30:03.224
Fine.

30:04.359 --> 30:06.559
But I wanna move it in a week.
Can you make that happen?

30:06.561 --> 30:08.327
"A week."

30:08.329 --> 30:10.131
Ollie, what,
you making plans?

30:10.832 --> 30:12.567
Yeah, Ian.

30:13.701 --> 30:15.537
And don't fuck it up,
okay?

30:16.271 --> 30:17.639
It's not just about me.

30:18.606 --> 30:20.408
And it's not about you.

30:22.443 --> 30:23.777
- It's about your family.
- Okay.

30:23.779 --> 30:25.581
- You understand?
- Yeah, I get it.

30:30.285 --> 30:31.520
All right.

30:33.321 --> 30:35.455
- Then we start tomorrow.
- Aye-aye, Captain.

30:35.457 --> 30:37.457
Just let me know when
and where to go.

30:37.459 --> 30:38.661
Hey, Ollie.

30:40.863 --> 30:42.431
Tell Deb
I said I'm sorry.

30:44.133 --> 30:45.734
Why don't you
tell her yourself?

31:20.370 --> 31:22.203
Can I make an appointment
with the doctor?

31:22.205 --> 31:24.238
Susie can help you
with that.

31:24.240 --> 31:26.874
We're pretty far behind.
It's gonna be four to six weeks.

31:26.876 --> 31:29.346
- Four to six weeks?
- I know. It's crazy.

31:30.280 --> 31:31.681
Um...

31:32.182 --> 31:34.349
Well, then can I just ask you
a couple of questions?

31:34.351 --> 31:37.886
- Shoot.
- How much over the whole pregnancy?

31:37.888 --> 31:40.622
I mean, you know, bare minimum.
How much is that?

31:40.624 --> 31:42.791
Depends
on your insurance.

31:42.793 --> 31:46.260
Your co-pay could be
as little as 10, 20 a visit.

31:46.262 --> 31:49.634
- Yeah. Well, what if I lost my insurance?
- No reimbursement.

31:50.901 --> 31:53.201
But if you do it right,

31:53.203 --> 31:57.272
you can get 12 prenatal visits
and some prenatal vitamins.

31:57.274 --> 32:00.709
So pregnancy and birth is going
to be about 8,000 or 9,000.

32:00.711 --> 32:03.312
And if you need
a Cesarean, 12.

32:03.314 --> 32:06.882
- Being pregnant costs $8,000?
- I'm afraid so, honey.

32:06.884 --> 32:10.354
Have you considered going home
and having the baby with family?

32:12.223 --> 32:15.393
I'm... I'm from here. I don't...
I don't really have...

32:18.696 --> 32:20.362
Um...

32:20.364 --> 32:22.566
Um, what about
other options?

34:18.351 --> 34:19.585
Hey, Ollie.

34:19.954 --> 34:21.355
Hey, ya.

34:21.956 --> 34:24.458
You got any coffee
in that old beater of yours?

34:25.391 --> 34:26.661
Yeah, you know I do.

34:29.130 --> 34:30.764
Hey, uh, how's the ankle?

34:31.431 --> 34:32.667
Been better.

34:32.967 --> 34:36.101
Yeah? Go to the hospital
like I said?

34:36.103 --> 34:39.407
Yeah. Waited for seven hours
and everything, but...

34:40.141 --> 34:42.010
only so long
a man can wait.

34:43.145 --> 34:46.547
You, uh...
You need anything for it?

34:49.784 --> 34:51.617
You got something?

34:51.619 --> 34:53.956
Yeah, Oxy.
Twelve a pill, but 10 for you.

34:55.991 --> 34:58.894
Yeah, I'll... I'll...
I'll take 10.

35:33.096 --> 35:35.598
Yep, I can be there
in about 35 minutes.

35:37.000 --> 35:38.768
East end of Tioga?

35:40.003 --> 35:42.371
Okay. Um, how many?

35:44.440 --> 35:47.510
I guess you're pulling
your weight after all, huh?

36:28.486 --> 36:30.121
Are you Ian's girl?

36:54.980 --> 36:56.181
Hey!

37:04.923 --> 37:06.523
Hey!

37:06.525 --> 37:09.461
Hold up a minute.
How much?

37:10.729 --> 37:12.028
You're Ian's girl,
right?

37:14.032 --> 37:17.469
- I'll give you five for a bottle.
- Two for 900.

37:18.036 --> 37:19.171
All right.

37:32.986 --> 37:34.153
You're early.

37:35.288 --> 37:37.922
Yeah, I thought that I'd
come before the interview.

37:37.924 --> 37:41.127
Just get this last check-in out of the
way, if that's okay.

37:43.096 --> 37:44.630
So just checking in?

37:45.231 --> 37:47.500
- Yeah.
- Okay.

37:48.034 --> 37:50.269
Okay.

37:52.939 --> 37:54.107
So...

37:55.174 --> 37:56.542
how are you feeling?

37:57.344 --> 37:58.778
Fine.

38:00.214 --> 38:03.914
Don't be nervous.
Just be yourself.

38:03.916 --> 38:06.253
Carter,
you usually have better advice than that.

38:07.121 --> 38:08.188
Well...

38:08.989 --> 38:11.091
Just talk to her like
you're a person.

38:11.657 --> 38:12.958
Sure.

38:12.960 --> 38:14.895
Be natural.

38:17.097 --> 38:19.364
I really don't think
that I can. I've...

38:19.366 --> 38:20.734
You can.

38:21.869 --> 38:23.070
Ollie...

38:27.207 --> 38:29.009
you deserve this.

38:34.382 --> 38:35.783
Yeah.

38:37.684 --> 38:41.154
Hey, uh, real quick.

38:41.156 --> 38:42.954
Just be honest with me.

38:42.956 --> 38:45.993
Was a thermal under
a blazer a bad idea?

38:48.063 --> 38:50.564
I'd have done an Oxford,
but it's okay.

38:51.900 --> 38:54.701
Okay. I don't have
time to change.

38:55.870 --> 38:57.772
I'm kidding.

39:09.384 --> 39:11.820
- Sheila Andrews. Hi.
- Nice to meet you.

39:12.821 --> 39:15.855
Whoo!
It was, uh, hard to find.

39:15.857 --> 39:17.759
Oh, yeah.

39:18.159 --> 39:19.194
Here. Uh...

39:19.694 --> 39:20.995
Okay.

39:23.399 --> 39:24.866
Hi.

39:25.834 --> 39:28.402
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

39:28.404 --> 39:31.273
Let me know if I can get
you ladies anything, okay?

39:32.975 --> 39:34.243
There you go.

39:36.312 --> 39:37.712
Okay.

39:42.384 --> 39:45.452
Wow.
It really is pricey here.

39:45.454 --> 39:47.421
Yeah.
It's the boom.

39:47.423 --> 39:49.423
It just...
everything has exploded.

39:49.425 --> 39:52.192
The housing is even worse,
if you can find it.

39:52.194 --> 39:56.464
That's why I started selling
things at the rigs to the guys.

39:56.466 --> 39:58.466
You know, just, uh,
coffee and whatnot.

39:58.468 --> 40:00.968
'Cause if you get 'em at
some of the carts in town,

40:00.970 --> 40:04.239
they can run you about six bucks
and they really aren't that good.

40:04.241 --> 40:06.207
So...

40:06.209 --> 40:08.245
Well, this is on me.

40:09.146 --> 40:11.045
- Oh, I didn't mean...
- Oh, no, it's all right.

40:11.047 --> 40:14.417
- Okay. Well, thank you.
- So, uh, Ollie...

40:15.118 --> 40:18.720
um, your probation officer,
Officer...

40:18.722 --> 40:20.121
- Carter.
- Carter...

40:20.123 --> 40:22.490
has told me so many things
about you.

40:22.492 --> 40:26.828
And, um, I think it goes without
saying that he must see a lot in you

40:26.830 --> 40:28.897
if he's willing
to vouch for you.

40:28.899 --> 40:30.000
Yeah.

40:30.867 --> 40:32.802
He's, uh, pretty great.

40:34.871 --> 40:38.740
So, why don't you tell me
a bit about you.

40:38.742 --> 40:41.109
What you've been doing
and what you'd like to be doing.

40:41.111 --> 40:42.280
Sure.

40:51.989 --> 40:54.957
You know what? Will you just excuse me?
I have to go to the bathroom.

40:54.959 --> 40:57.094
- I'm sorry.
- Oh, of course.

41:05.903 --> 41:07.903
- What? What do you want?
- I just want to talk for a bit.

41:07.905 --> 41:10.105
- About what? I'm busy.
- A little birdie told me...

41:10.107 --> 41:13.008
Fuck your little birdie, Bill!
What do you want?

41:13.010 --> 41:14.977
I want a cut.

41:14.979 --> 41:16.281
Of what?

41:17.282 --> 41:19.884
I know
you're selling again.

41:21.453 --> 41:23.819
And I don't appreciate
losing customers

41:23.821 --> 41:26.456
because you decided to
get back in the business.

41:26.458 --> 41:29.059
So, I'll make you a deal.
You give me a cut,

41:29.061 --> 41:30.826
I don't get greedy,
and I don't get angry.

41:30.828 --> 41:32.197
I don't know
who told you, but I'm...

41:34.499 --> 41:37.334
I'm making this real simple for you, King.

41:37.336 --> 41:39.404
You keep selling,
you give me 30%,

41:40.138 --> 41:43.108
or you do what you do best and make
a run across the border for me.

41:44.042 --> 41:45.978
Hey, I'll even pay you.

41:46.478 --> 41:48.247
That's only fair.

41:49.281 --> 41:50.949
You're not gonna lie to me.

41:52.251 --> 41:53.919
So choose.

41:54.420 --> 41:56.052
Mm. Mm.

41:56.054 --> 41:58.088
I'm not crossing
the border again.

41:58.090 --> 41:59.525
I'm not taking that risk.

42:01.594 --> 42:03.263
So you're selling, then.

42:10.436 --> 42:12.538
I'm glad
we figured that out.

42:14.874 --> 42:16.309
You look nice.

42:17.477 --> 42:18.878
We done?

42:21.314 --> 42:22.515
Yeah.

42:35.161 --> 42:37.262
- Sorry about that.
- Are you okay?

42:37.264 --> 42:39.163
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

42:39.165 --> 42:43.101
I just, uh, have to pee when I get nervous.

42:43.103 --> 42:45.203
Well,
let's get started.

42:45.205 --> 42:46.240
Okay.

43:33.688 --> 43:36.022
Carter. Hi.

43:36.024 --> 43:37.058
Hey.

43:37.926 --> 43:39.592
Hope you don't mind me
stopping by.

43:39.594 --> 43:41.496
Just wanted to see
how it went.

43:42.130 --> 43:43.697
No, of course.

43:43.699 --> 43:45.133
Come on in.

43:49.971 --> 43:53.507
I haven't done a drop-in for some
time, so I, uh, you know,

43:53.509 --> 43:55.344
thought I'd double up
on my duties.

43:56.379 --> 43:57.480
Sure.

44:04.687 --> 44:06.422
Sheila
called me after.

44:08.591 --> 44:11.425
Yeah? God.

44:11.427 --> 44:14.997
Hope she didn't think
I was a crazy person.

44:16.031 --> 44:18.067
No.
No, she loved you.

44:23.372 --> 44:26.473
She said she knows that part of
starting over is having a good job,

44:26.475 --> 44:28.043
having purpose.

44:36.653 --> 44:38.386
At least,
that's what she said.

44:41.691 --> 44:45.262
Did she say...
anything else?

44:46.530 --> 44:48.398
She'll call you
in a couple days.

45:04.381 --> 45:06.082
I'm proud of you.

45:49.260 --> 45:52.429
- Hey.
- Hey, what's going on?

45:52.431 --> 45:54.698
You've gotta be quiet.
Johnny's napping in the back.

45:54.700 --> 45:56.200
Oh, sorry.

45:56.735 --> 45:58.069
Uh...

46:01.173 --> 46:03.242
- I need a favor.
- What kind?

46:04.076 --> 46:05.842
I had a real close call
with my P.O.,

46:05.844 --> 46:07.779
so I gotta
keep this here.

46:09.081 --> 46:10.582
You're selling.

46:11.116 --> 46:13.285
Nah, I'm just having a big
party over the weekend.

46:15.420 --> 46:18.355
How'd you think I was gonna
make three grand in seven days?

46:18.357 --> 46:20.290
Panhandling?
Waitressing?

46:20.292 --> 46:22.327
So that's why
Bill roughed you up today.

46:23.128 --> 46:24.695
You on his turf
or somethin'?

46:24.697 --> 46:26.633
Isn't this getting old?

46:28.535 --> 46:31.268
- I'm doing this for you.
- Well, what do you want? Gratitude?

46:31.270 --> 46:33.169
What do you want?
For me to say I'm sorry?

46:33.171 --> 46:35.107
For what?
You never do anything wrong.

46:37.142 --> 46:39.479
You knew what I meant
when I said I'd figure it out.

46:41.581 --> 46:43.116
Yeah, you did.

46:45.618 --> 46:47.787
You used to make it sound
so good.

46:48.354 --> 46:51.090
Going to Canada and coming back
with a ton of drugs.

46:51.558 --> 46:55.293
Dana's mom got her ARBs,
Sarah got her abortion pills,

46:55.295 --> 46:58.329
Tom got his kid's
antibiotics, and...

46:58.331 --> 47:00.099
and Mom got her meds.

47:01.301 --> 47:04.137
But you'd forget to mention to
me the other stuff you brought.

47:04.370 --> 47:06.072
You don't get it.

47:06.607 --> 47:10.374
Every day I'm with Mom,
and she's dying, and all I can do

47:10.376 --> 47:12.713
is get her some medication
so it hurts less,

47:13.581 --> 47:15.549
so that she lives
a little bit longer.

47:17.918 --> 47:20.752
What'd you want me
to do, huh? Nothing?

47:20.754 --> 47:23.324
- I get that we had no choice.
- No, I.

47:24.158 --> 47:26.660
I had no choice.
Because you weren't there.

47:31.599 --> 47:34.700
It's not what I wanted, all right?
It just kind of turned into this.

47:34.702 --> 47:38.470
And now I don't want to leave you until
you have that house. I'm halfway there.

47:38.472 --> 47:42.644
House or no house,
I can't keep this baby.

47:44.511 --> 47:46.748
Your choices are only as
good as your options are.

47:47.314 --> 47:48.583
So are yours.

47:49.751 --> 47:51.185
I know.

48:06.735 --> 48:08.803
Can you do this
without getting caught?

48:10.205 --> 48:12.807
- Yes.
- Are you sure?

48:13.876 --> 48:15.610
Of course not.

48:20.348 --> 48:21.717
I'll keep this here.

48:33.261 --> 48:34.463
How'd your interview go?

48:34.964 --> 48:36.365
I don't know.

48:36.799 --> 48:39.933
I wore
a really stupid thing.

48:39.935 --> 48:42.670
- You look...
- No, I look...

48:42.672 --> 48:44.805
I mean, come on.
Would you hire me?

48:44.807 --> 48:45.875
I would.

48:49.512 --> 48:51.412
How many days you got left?

48:51.414 --> 48:52.648
Four.

48:53.616 --> 48:55.284
You're so close.

48:55.819 --> 48:57.653
Don't worry
about me.

48:59.890 --> 49:01.257
Worry about him.

49:02.591 --> 49:03.727
Hmm.

49:23.046 --> 49:24.481
I knew you'd be back.

49:25.415 --> 49:27.716
I'm not here
about work.

49:27.718 --> 49:29.553
Yeah? You come here
for a dance?

49:34.324 --> 49:37.494
Uh, I heard you got a
procedure done around here,

49:37.995 --> 49:39.864
not at a hospital.

49:40.732 --> 49:42.599
I ain't got nothin'
for you, honey.

49:42.800 --> 49:44.867
Jenny, I'm not trying to
get anyone in trouble.

49:44.869 --> 49:46.669
Yeah, well,
you ain't gotta try.

49:46.671 --> 49:48.971
All you got to do is go around
asking too many questions,

49:48.973 --> 49:50.875
- and you're doing that right off the top.
- Come on.

49:51.709 --> 49:53.811
I just need
Taylor's address.

49:54.545 --> 49:56.347
There are a million girls
I could've got it from.

49:57.381 --> 49:58.649
But you're asking me?

49:59.684 --> 50:01.419
I'm asking you
to help me.

50:06.657 --> 50:07.759
Hmm.

50:09.494 --> 50:10.929
I like
your necklace.

50:12.530 --> 50:14.398
- No.
- Your earrings.

50:18.703 --> 50:19.972
Fine.

50:45.098 --> 50:47.533
What, you never seen
a woman before? Come on.

50:48.500 --> 50:50.904
Eyeballs in your head, motherfucker.
You ain't gettin' none.

50:51.603 --> 50:54.872
Fuck that guy.

50:54.874 --> 50:56.843
Fucking guys
in this town. Here.

50:59.012 --> 51:00.579
Oh, come on.
Really?

51:02.615 --> 51:03.817
You know
where I live.

51:05.952 --> 51:07.887
- All right.
- Yeah, I need more people.

51:08.555 --> 51:11.122
People who want to buy more
and are willing to spend more.

51:11.124 --> 51:12.892
There's a rodeo tonight
in Minot.

51:13.726 --> 51:15.595
Those guys pop Oxy
like there's no tomorrow.

51:15.829 --> 51:18.565
- You know any of 'em?
- My boy Beau rides, man.

51:19.799 --> 51:21.668
You trust
this boy, Beau?

51:22.936 --> 51:25.036
Yeah, I do.
They're gentlemen.

51:25.038 --> 51:26.906
No worries.
They got a lot of money.

52:42.050 --> 52:44.153
Hey, are you Beau?

53:25.262 --> 53:27.628
Well, well.
That was quick.

53:27.630 --> 53:30.000
- Here.
- Hold up.

53:30.934 --> 53:32.668
I'm on a schedule. What?

53:33.769 --> 53:35.270
Where'd you get
all this?

53:35.272 --> 53:36.572
I sold.

53:37.606 --> 53:39.009
More skills than anyone
needs, you got it.

53:40.243 --> 53:42.511
You sure you don't want to
make that trip over for me?

53:43.947 --> 53:45.649
How much would
you pay me?

53:46.817 --> 53:48.085
Fifteen hundred.

53:52.322 --> 53:54.257
You're thinking about it,
ain't ya?

54:01.332 --> 54:03.533
I don't have to know you
to know you.

54:21.085 --> 54:22.286
Hello?

54:24.956 --> 54:26.290
Oh, okay.

54:27.992 --> 54:30.094
Yeah, I can
pick it up today.

54:32.630 --> 54:35.733
Nope. The wooden urn
is fine.

55:52.245 --> 55:54.814
What?

56:00.787 --> 56:01.921
Oh.

56:05.159 --> 56:07.094
- Hi.
- Hi.

56:13.901 --> 56:15.402
I'm glad you're here.

56:17.371 --> 56:19.006
You wanna sit down?

56:30.384 --> 56:31.952
Oh, that's just
too far.

56:33.220 --> 56:35.455
What?

56:35.457 --> 56:36.857
Will you come here?

56:38.926 --> 56:41.962
- Mm...
- Promise I'll just hold your hand.

56:43.864 --> 56:46.132
You shouldn't trust me.

56:46.134 --> 56:47.435
But be adventurous.

56:48.769 --> 56:50.671
Okay.

56:57.879 --> 57:00.949
See, that's all right.

57:11.460 --> 57:13.396
I made a decision,

57:14.930 --> 57:17.899
and... I want to
tell you.

57:20.369 --> 57:21.770
Okay.

57:23.272 --> 57:24.839
It's okay.

57:29.212 --> 57:31.047
I found out
I'm pregnant.

57:33.983 --> 57:35.051
Okay.

57:35.851 --> 57:37.320
And I'm not
going to have it.

57:43.292 --> 57:44.327
What?

57:45.194 --> 57:48.064
- Yeah.
- Wait a minute. What...

57:51.901 --> 57:54.134
- Okay, um...
- Yeah.

57:54.136 --> 57:56.036
Listen, if this is
about money...

57:56.038 --> 57:57.374
No, it's not just
about money.

57:59.276 --> 58:01.844
I can get food.
I can get clothes.

58:02.312 --> 58:05.113
Having a baby is more than
buying food and clothes.

58:05.115 --> 58:06.814
- Do you want to get married?
- No.

58:06.816 --> 58:08.250
We can get married.

58:08.252 --> 58:11.253
Johnny has always been
more than enough for me.

58:11.255 --> 58:13.756
- What?
- And you know I can't depend on you.

58:15.259 --> 58:16.293
I'm...

58:18.962 --> 58:22.964
- I have a good thing going with Ollie.
- Oh, no, Ollie's leaving, Ian.

58:22.966 --> 58:25.402
Ollie is leaving,
and we've gotta let her go.

58:27.371 --> 58:29.339
You can depend on me.

58:34.177 --> 58:36.179
I... I can't.

58:41.452 --> 58:43.954
- I can do better.
- You can.

58:50.962 --> 58:52.330
I'm sorry.

59:56.161 --> 59:57.564
Where is it?

01:00:02.935 --> 01:00:05.003
What happened? Deb?

01:00:13.279 --> 01:00:14.381
What's going on?

01:00:15.615 --> 01:00:18.583
I had a plan, you know?
I was gonna go to Taylor's tonight.

01:00:18.585 --> 01:00:21.619
- Oh, no. Why?
- I didn't even make it.

01:00:21.621 --> 01:00:25.289
I went home to drop Johnny off
at my neighbor's,

01:00:25.291 --> 01:00:28.361
and, well, home was gone.

01:00:29.362 --> 01:00:32.631
They towed it away, everything I
had, everything was in there.

01:00:32.633 --> 01:00:34.500
- Our money...
- Wait, what?

01:00:34.502 --> 01:00:38.270
The trailer...
The trailer is gone.

01:00:38.272 --> 01:00:40.439
How? What do you mean,
it's gone? Who took it?

01:00:40.441 --> 01:00:42.708
They've been threatening for weeks.
I never thought...

01:00:42.710 --> 01:00:45.377
You didn't think to mention that
when I put everything in there?

01:00:45.379 --> 01:00:47.581
No, I never thought
that they'd actually do it.

01:00:48.549 --> 01:00:50.418
Yeah,
'cause you never think.

01:00:53.254 --> 01:00:57.057
Fine. I'll talk to Bill. I'll borrow a
couple hundred. We'll get it out of the tow.

01:00:57.725 --> 01:00:59.493
My name's not
on the paperwork.

01:01:00.394 --> 01:01:03.497
I basically just took it over
when someone left.

01:01:04.131 --> 01:01:05.531
Fuck.

01:01:05.533 --> 01:01:07.366
- What if they find the stuff?
- Fuck.

01:01:07.368 --> 01:01:09.334
What if they search
the trailer?

01:01:09.336 --> 01:01:11.571
Deb, why are you so good
at fucking things up?

01:01:11.573 --> 01:01:15.477
- How was I supposed to know that they...
- God, you are such a mess!

01:01:17.512 --> 01:01:21.247
Everything is a mess and I'm always
the one that has to clean it up!

01:01:21.249 --> 01:01:24.016
I'm so tired of that.
I'm so fucking tired of you!

01:01:24.018 --> 01:01:27.520
- No one is asking you to do anything for me, Ollie!
- Mommy?

01:01:27.522 --> 01:01:30.290
Johnny, stay in there!
What are you...

01:01:30.292 --> 01:01:34.329
You don't get to do that. You don't get
to run off and make me feel like shit!

01:01:36.398 --> 01:01:38.633
You don't get to do that
anymore!

01:01:52.147 --> 01:01:53.781
You're too kind.

01:02:19.609 --> 01:02:21.275
Hey.

01:02:21.277 --> 01:02:23.210
What are you doing here
all by yourself?

01:02:23.212 --> 01:02:25.079
I'm not in the mood
to talk.

01:02:25.081 --> 01:02:26.681
Come on, you'll talk
to me, won't ya?

01:02:26.683 --> 01:02:29.350
I don't know you,
and I don't want to.

01:02:29.352 --> 01:02:31.220
Fuck you, bitch!

01:05:59.768 --> 01:06:01.636
I like the urn.

01:06:06.007 --> 01:06:08.310
It's the cheapest one
they had.

01:06:12.081 --> 01:06:15.648
Such a force of nature
in such a little box.

01:06:15.650 --> 01:06:18.386
Yeah,
that's the way it goes.

01:06:23.558 --> 01:06:24.894
Where'd you go?

01:06:26.361 --> 01:06:27.964
Got drunk,
drove around.

01:06:29.397 --> 01:06:32.733
I got into the trailer, but all the
money and the pills were all gone.

01:06:32.735 --> 01:06:34.269
Oh, Christ.

01:06:36.806 --> 01:06:38.839
You were always
the better drunk driver.

01:06:38.841 --> 01:06:40.941
There's no such thing
as a good drunk driver.

01:06:40.943 --> 01:06:42.743
- Then what are you?
- Bad.

01:06:46.415 --> 01:06:48.716
I did get some of your stuff.

01:06:48.718 --> 01:06:50.551
And you've still got
clothes here, so...

01:06:50.553 --> 01:06:53.023
Small victories,
I guess.

01:06:54.457 --> 01:06:55.859
What happened
to the stuff?

01:06:56.726 --> 01:07:00.061
I don't know.
There's not a lot of legal recourse

01:07:00.063 --> 01:07:01.597
for drug dealers,
you know.

01:07:09.372 --> 01:07:11.475
Deb, come on.
You're pregnant.

01:07:13.911 --> 01:07:16.713
It costs $8,000
just to have a baby.

01:07:20.717 --> 01:07:23.387
I did try to figure things out
on my own, you know.

01:07:24.521 --> 01:07:26.323
I went to
the women's clinic,

01:07:27.025 --> 01:07:31.095
and they told me that with
check-ups and vitamins and delivery,

01:07:31.862 --> 01:07:36.067
without insurance,
it's $8,000.

01:07:38.903 --> 01:07:40.905
She was sure
to give me this though.

01:07:42.106 --> 01:07:44.006
Closest place for an
abortion, she said.

01:07:44.008 --> 01:07:45.109
Where is it?

01:07:46.244 --> 01:07:49.111
- Hundreds of miles away.
- Well, I can get you there.

01:07:49.113 --> 01:07:51.950
Hundreds of dollars more
than I can afford.

01:07:53.151 --> 01:07:55.420
And if Taylor's
is off the table...

01:07:56.821 --> 01:08:00.525
I'm starting to see why Canada's
so appealing to people.

01:08:14.907 --> 01:08:18.541
- I'll take you up, get you sorted out.
- No.

01:08:18.542 --> 01:08:20.542
- Bring you back.
- No.

01:08:20.545 --> 01:08:23.113
Bill's been asking me to take
something across for him.

01:08:23.115 --> 01:08:25.816
I'll go up, he'll pay me,
I'll take you.

01:08:25.818 --> 01:08:27.853
- Same difference, huh?
- No.

01:08:29.488 --> 01:08:30.856
It's your choice.

01:08:31.523 --> 01:08:33.392
I can get you up there
if you want.

01:08:41.466 --> 01:08:43.103
What would I have to do?

01:08:44.870 --> 01:08:47.504
Go to the Carabans
for a Canadian health card.

01:08:47.506 --> 01:08:49.240
- They took over when I stopped.
- No.

01:08:49.242 --> 01:08:51.111
Hey, there's no way
around it.

01:08:56.682 --> 01:09:00.618
What went wrong last time,
when you got caught?

01:09:03.590 --> 01:09:05.191
I forgot to be scared,

01:09:07.160 --> 01:09:08.929
'cause I liked it
too much.

01:09:36.023 --> 01:09:37.691
Hey, Johnny.

01:09:38.259 --> 01:09:40.091
Have you ever seen
a buffalo before?

01:09:40.094 --> 01:09:42.060
- Look.
- Buffalo?

01:09:42.063 --> 01:09:43.496
Yeah, buffalo.

01:09:45.166 --> 01:09:47.902
- Oh, it's a buffalo!
- Yeah.

01:09:52.573 --> 01:09:54.238
They're usually
pretty grumpy,

01:09:54.241 --> 01:09:56.110
but that one looks
like he's smiling.

01:09:57.011 --> 01:09:58.179
Must be you.

01:10:05.153 --> 01:10:06.854
Pretty neat, huh?

01:10:11.193 --> 01:10:14.227
Don't.

01:10:14.229 --> 01:10:15.596
All right.

01:10:16.597 --> 01:10:18.699
- All right, keep building.
- Okay.

01:10:22.070 --> 01:10:24.006
Oh, visit so soon.

01:10:24.306 --> 01:10:25.607
Hey, kiddo.

01:10:26.742 --> 01:10:27.976
Can we talk?

01:10:37.320 --> 01:10:39.353
Sweetheart,
you remember Ollie, right?

01:10:39.355 --> 01:10:41.087
- Yeah.
- Hey, Jody.

01:10:41.089 --> 01:10:43.056
- Hi.
- This is Johnny.

01:10:43.058 --> 01:10:45.192
Is it okay if he hangs out
with you for a little bit?

01:10:45.194 --> 01:10:47.861
- Yeah.
- Yeah? Okay.

01:10:47.863 --> 01:10:50.797
Hey, sweetie, why don't you tell Johnny
about what happened to Grumpy Bear?

01:10:50.799 --> 01:10:54.634
"Grumpy Bear"... that's what we call
him in the morning when he wakes up.

01:10:56.039 --> 01:10:57.738
Hey, Johnny?

01:10:57.740 --> 01:11:00.274
When you cough, remember
to cover your mouth, okay?

01:11:00.276 --> 01:11:02.045
Johnny, wanna
help me with this?

01:11:09.652 --> 01:11:11.687
Three thousand. Take it or leave it.

01:11:12.321 --> 01:11:13.756
I can go tomorrow.

01:11:15.892 --> 01:11:16.926
Okay.

01:11:30.740 --> 01:11:32.276
MRIs are in here,

01:11:32.976 --> 01:11:35.212
and what you're gonna drop off
is in here.

01:11:36.046 --> 01:11:37.181
It's a pill mill run?

01:11:44.721 --> 01:11:46.788
Why are you doing it
in Manitoba?

01:11:46.790 --> 01:11:49.293
Mills are crawling with feds
this side of the border.

01:11:50.127 --> 01:11:52.129
You can thank
the meth heads for that.

01:11:52.863 --> 01:11:56.301
Besides, the closest one is an hour away.
Just happens to be in Canada.

01:11:58.202 --> 01:12:00.902
- What's in the bag?
- Nothing you need to worry about.

01:12:00.904 --> 01:12:02.671
I'm transporting it.
I should know.

01:12:02.673 --> 01:12:04.375
To do your job,
you don't need to know shit.

01:12:07.911 --> 01:12:09.345
That's half the 3K.

01:12:09.347 --> 01:12:10.982
The rest
when you get back.

01:12:16.821 --> 01:12:18.156
I'll see you
in a couple days.

01:12:27.265 --> 01:12:28.299
Eat.

01:12:38.109 --> 01:12:39.878
You should go wake him up.

01:12:41.247 --> 01:12:42.847
We gotta head out in a bit.

01:12:43.482 --> 01:12:44.916
Get your ID.

01:12:45.417 --> 01:12:47.386
It's not too
late to back out,

01:12:48.853 --> 01:12:50.923
if you think
it might not be worth it.

01:12:53.791 --> 01:12:55.027
It's worth it.

01:13:55.855 --> 01:13:57.190
You sure this is it?

01:13:58.124 --> 01:13:59.893
Yeah, this is the place.

01:14:01.562 --> 01:14:03.264
It's exactly
how they described.

01:14:03.964 --> 01:14:05.099
All right.

01:14:07.068 --> 01:14:08.802
Call me if you need me.

01:14:13.107 --> 01:14:14.475
You're brave.

01:15:04.860 --> 01:15:06.359
Hi, I'm Deb.

01:15:06.361 --> 01:15:07.861
Joe.

01:15:07.863 --> 01:15:09.863
I called earlier
about...

01:15:09.865 --> 01:15:10.899
Yeah.

01:15:12.368 --> 01:15:13.403
Come on in.

01:15:30.586 --> 01:15:34.023
So... can I see them?

01:15:36.159 --> 01:15:37.327
Yeah.

01:15:46.537 --> 01:15:47.571
We got our...

01:15:48.271 --> 01:15:50.340
Manitoba Health, uh...

01:15:51.941 --> 01:15:53.444
state IDs.

01:15:55.546 --> 01:15:57.381
How do we know
we can trust you?

01:16:00.149 --> 01:16:01.452
Um...

01:16:02.952 --> 01:16:04.421
Why wouldn't you?

01:16:05.356 --> 01:16:06.923
It's a fair question.

01:16:08.692 --> 01:16:10.127
Here, take a look.

01:16:25.376 --> 01:16:27.579
So, uh, mine... mine
would look like this?

01:16:28.345 --> 01:16:29.547
Yeah.

01:16:31.315 --> 01:16:33.050
How much money you got?

01:16:40.090 --> 01:16:42.059
It's what we agreed.

01:16:48.666 --> 01:16:53.004
Okay. Take her in. Follow him.

01:16:54.139 --> 01:16:55.673
You'll sit there.

01:17:23.469 --> 01:17:24.703
Evening.

01:17:25.738 --> 01:17:27.106
Evenin'.

01:17:28.541 --> 01:17:30.176
Do you have
another one of those?

01:17:31.043 --> 01:17:33.579
The, uh, machine inside
is out.

01:17:34.547 --> 01:17:36.182
Oh, yeah, sure.

01:17:37.416 --> 01:17:38.551
Thanks.

01:17:39.351 --> 01:17:41.187
- Do you need a light?
- No, no, I got it.

01:17:47.026 --> 01:17:49.195
- Colder out here than you expected, eh?
- Uh-huh.

01:17:50.162 --> 01:17:52.097
Freaking cold, yeah.

01:17:53.467 --> 01:17:55.132
You from around
these parts?

01:17:55.134 --> 01:17:56.269
No.

01:17:58.772 --> 01:18:00.973
What brings you out this way?

01:18:01.708 --> 01:18:05.410
I just heard this was the foremost
pit stop in North Dakota, so...

01:18:05.412 --> 01:18:08.048
just checking it out.

01:18:13.820 --> 01:18:16.256
So, just you
out tonight?

01:18:18.558 --> 01:18:20.560
No, I got my, uh...

01:18:31.506 --> 01:18:33.039
She needs to take
her coat off.

01:18:33.541 --> 01:18:35.242
- What?
- Take off your coat.

01:18:35.843 --> 01:18:38.078
No one wears
their coat in a picture.

01:18:52.627 --> 01:18:54.295
Yeah, that's good.

01:18:55.530 --> 01:18:57.429
- Yeah, that's good.
- Where are you going?

01:18:57.431 --> 01:18:58.566
To print this out.

01:19:08.276 --> 01:19:10.211
Who told you about us?

01:19:10.712 --> 01:19:11.713
Ollie.

01:19:13.114 --> 01:19:14.616
I don't think I know
who that is.

01:19:16.117 --> 01:19:18.152
- Oleander.
- Never heard of her.

01:19:20.289 --> 01:19:21.823
- I thought...
- And I don't know you.

01:19:24.593 --> 01:19:25.794
So what?

01:19:27.829 --> 01:19:29.231
Well, here's the thing.

01:19:29.798 --> 01:19:31.598
You're a stranger,

01:19:31.600 --> 01:19:33.702
and you're asking us to do
something illegal.

01:19:35.237 --> 01:19:36.638
So we're gonna
need more.

01:19:39.374 --> 01:19:42.144
Money. Just to make sure
you're all right.

01:19:44.479 --> 01:19:46.348
How much more?

01:19:46.849 --> 01:19:48.216
A hundred.

01:19:50.920 --> 01:19:52.655
I don't have that.

01:19:54.924 --> 01:19:57.192
Okay.
What do you have?

01:20:02.532 --> 01:20:04.665
Uh, my watch.

01:20:04.667 --> 01:20:07.268
You know, I...
Do you want my watch?

01:20:07.270 --> 01:20:09.105
No. No, what else?

01:20:09.439 --> 01:20:11.307
I don't...

01:20:13.309 --> 01:20:16.346
My necklace?
This was my mom's, though, so...

01:20:17.513 --> 01:20:18.882
No, I don't think
that's gonna do it.

01:20:24.722 --> 01:20:27.455
All right. Hold on,
hold on, hold on.

01:20:27.457 --> 01:20:30.324
- Give me back my money.
- Just relax.

01:20:30.326 --> 01:20:33.562
- Give me back my money. Okay? I'm gonna go somewhere else.
- It's fine. Just relax.

01:20:33.564 --> 01:20:35.198
Just relax.

01:20:35.633 --> 01:20:37.866
Give me back...

01:20:37.868 --> 01:20:39.837
- What are you doing?
- Let go! Get me go!

01:20:46.243 --> 01:20:47.843
Let go of my arm.

01:20:47.845 --> 01:20:50.147
You need to relax.

01:20:53.918 --> 01:20:56.553
Okay. All right.
All right.

01:21:01.726 --> 01:21:04.461
I have more money.
I have more.

01:21:06.230 --> 01:21:07.866
Just let me get my jacket.

01:21:12.269 --> 01:21:14.304
Well, why didn't you say so?

01:21:14.939 --> 01:21:16.706
Just let me go get it.

01:21:16.708 --> 01:21:19.575
Of course.
Of course I will.

01:21:19.577 --> 01:21:20.779
Yeah.

01:21:21.946 --> 01:21:23.348
Yeah.

01:21:25.450 --> 01:21:26.651
Go get it.

01:21:30.522 --> 01:21:31.587
Joe!

01:21:36.862 --> 01:21:38.594
You this boy's mother?

01:21:38.596 --> 01:21:39.699
Do I look like it?

01:21:40.833 --> 01:21:43.734
- I need you to step over here, please.
- Sorry, I...

01:21:43.736 --> 01:21:46.937
- Ma'am, I need you to come step right over here, please.
- Oh, okay.

01:21:46.939 --> 01:21:48.007
Thank you.

01:21:50.009 --> 01:21:53.244
- Is there a problem?
- Well, we're about to find out.

01:21:53.946 --> 01:21:56.449
- Hey.
- Hi.

01:21:57.950 --> 01:22:01.854
I was just telling the officer here
how we're on a little trip to see Mom.

01:22:03.055 --> 01:22:05.424
Yeah.
Sorry I took so long.

01:22:06.059 --> 01:22:08.461
Bathroom was out of service.
I had to go out back.

01:22:11.697 --> 01:22:13.365
Yeah, she's pregnant.

01:22:15.001 --> 01:22:16.502
Can't hold it
too good.

01:22:20.639 --> 01:22:22.306
Where does Mom live?

01:22:22.308 --> 01:22:23.977
- In Portal.
- Portal.

01:22:33.019 --> 01:22:34.421
All right.

01:22:35.522 --> 01:22:37.689
- All right, you drive safe.
- I'll do that.

01:22:37.691 --> 01:22:38.725
Good night.

01:22:38.992 --> 01:22:41.027
Go. Go.

01:22:43.663 --> 01:22:46.366
Get up, Bear. Get up.
Drive. Drive. Drive.

01:22:55.742 --> 01:22:57.979
What happened back there?

01:22:58.645 --> 01:23:01.381
Well, it didn't exactly go
like we planned.

01:23:02.650 --> 01:23:03.751
Jesus.

01:23:05.052 --> 01:23:06.319
Those fuckers.

01:23:07.088 --> 01:23:08.823
You're okay, Bear.

01:23:10.758 --> 01:23:11.926
It's okay.

01:23:51.400 --> 01:23:53.066
It's a long walk.

01:23:53.068 --> 01:23:54.970
I'll carry him
if I have to.

01:23:56.805 --> 01:23:58.104
All right.

01:23:58.106 --> 01:24:00.507
Johnny.
Time to get up.

01:24:00.509 --> 01:24:02.945
- Come on. Come on, Bear.
- Come on.

01:24:04.413 --> 01:24:06.115
Okay? Let's go.

01:24:30.139 --> 01:24:34.075
- Come on, Bear.
- It's gotta be this way.

01:24:34.077 --> 01:24:36.811
Come on. I know you're tired.
Hey, Bear, look at me.

01:24:36.813 --> 01:24:39.981
Look at me. We're so close,
and then we're gonna get it done.

01:24:39.983 --> 01:24:43.386
Come on, we got to move.
Sun's coming up, Deb.

01:24:44.520 --> 01:24:47.588
- I know, but come on.
- We got to get a move-on.

01:24:47.590 --> 01:24:50.993
Okay, I'm gonna carry him.

01:24:50.995 --> 01:24:52.363
Okay?

01:24:53.030 --> 01:24:54.899
Careful. Come on.

01:24:55.900 --> 01:24:57.433
All right.
I got you.

01:25:17.855 --> 01:25:19.023
Deb.

01:25:20.524 --> 01:25:21.892
Come on.

01:25:46.952 --> 01:25:48.153
Hey, Ger.

01:26:10.642 --> 01:26:11.843
Be right back.

01:26:17.817 --> 01:26:19.919
Hey, I forgot to say thanks
for picking us up.

01:26:20.853 --> 01:26:22.487
I'm always here to help.

01:26:23.923 --> 01:26:27.157
But I was sure you meant it when you
said I wouldn't be seeing you again.

01:26:27.159 --> 01:26:29.962
Yeah, I did.
It's a family emergency.

01:26:31.097 --> 01:26:34.031
Well, you're lucky.
I happen to have a room free.

01:26:34.033 --> 01:26:37.067
Oh, Gerry,
you always have a room free.

01:26:38.871 --> 01:26:40.139
You got me there.

01:26:42.975 --> 01:26:44.211
Thanks.

01:26:44.977 --> 01:26:48.179
- Also, I need a favor.
- What's that?

01:26:48.181 --> 01:26:51.282
You think I could borrow your car?
Just for a few hours?

01:26:51.284 --> 01:26:52.651
Sure.

01:26:53.819 --> 01:26:55.286
- What's the second?
- Okay.

01:26:55.288 --> 01:26:57.523
Uh, I need someone
to watch the kid.

01:26:57.891 --> 01:26:59.625
Just while I'm out
with his mom.

01:27:01.094 --> 01:27:02.195
Please?

01:27:02.929 --> 01:27:04.564
Really,
it's the last time.

01:27:06.166 --> 01:27:07.234
We'll see.

01:27:08.668 --> 01:27:10.170
I don't know
about your part.

01:27:12.739 --> 01:27:15.242
- It's quite far.
- Yeah, I know.

01:27:17.644 --> 01:27:20.045
- What do you think?
- Yeah, I think that's good.

01:27:20.047 --> 01:27:22.082
But I don't know.
I think it's too much lipstick.

01:27:23.984 --> 01:27:26.686
She doesn't look like
she wears that much makeup.

01:27:28.222 --> 01:27:30.557
- Better?
- Yeah. That's good.

01:27:31.125 --> 01:27:33.593
- That's the best we can do, I think.
- That's good.

01:27:34.228 --> 01:27:35.830
They hardly look.

01:27:40.201 --> 01:27:41.269
Hey, Bear.

01:27:42.904 --> 01:27:44.172
Wake up.

01:27:45.706 --> 01:27:48.307
Hey, my friend Gerry
is gonna

01:27:48.309 --> 01:27:51.579
take care of you for a bit
while I go to the doctor.

01:27:52.113 --> 01:27:54.680
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

01:27:54.682 --> 01:27:55.716
Bear, don't worry.

01:27:56.318 --> 01:27:57.752
I'll be right back.

01:27:58.920 --> 01:28:02.655
I'm just going for a checkup.
Then I'll be as good as new.

01:28:02.657 --> 01:28:05.626
- Pinky promise?
- Pinky promise.

01:28:31.720 --> 01:28:34.287
Ignore 'em.
I mean, look at 'em.

01:28:34.289 --> 01:28:37.757
Their signs aren't even that great.

01:28:37.759 --> 01:28:38.794
Hey.

01:28:39.061 --> 01:28:40.396
You're all set, okay?

01:28:41.630 --> 01:28:44.234
If you have any trouble,
anything happens, call this number.

01:28:46.336 --> 01:28:47.769
I'll be all right.

01:28:48.338 --> 01:28:49.372
You're brave.

01:28:51.141 --> 01:28:54.077
Yeah.

01:29:24.475 --> 01:29:26.375
Do you have
an appointment?

01:29:26.377 --> 01:29:29.011
Yeah. My name's Barbara.
Mulaney, Barbara Mulaney.

01:29:29.013 --> 01:29:30.414
- At what time?
- 10:30.

01:29:31.115 --> 01:29:33.050
May I see
your health card, please?

01:29:35.853 --> 01:29:37.121
Thank you.

01:29:44.995 --> 01:29:47.396
Hmm. Uh...
Just one sec.

01:29:51.869 --> 01:29:52.903
Wait.

01:29:56.408 --> 01:29:59.141
Yeah, it...
it's not working.

01:29:59.143 --> 01:30:01.211
I've probably
got the numbers wrong.

01:30:01.213 --> 01:30:03.413
I'm due for
a new prescription.

01:30:03.415 --> 01:30:05.481
It... It might have expired.
I'll just...

01:30:05.483 --> 01:30:08.119
Would you mind reading the
numbers out to me, sweetheart?

01:30:09.955 --> 01:30:11.056
Uh...

01:30:12.357 --> 01:30:13.191
Sure.

01:30:14.159 --> 01:30:17.395
Zero, nine, five, one,
two, zero, four.

01:30:18.830 --> 01:30:19.931
Is that right?

01:30:32.110 --> 01:30:33.211
Um...

01:30:35.113 --> 01:30:36.282
You're all set.

01:30:36.549 --> 01:30:38.549
Uh... Just, uh,

01:30:38.551 --> 01:30:41.285
fill out these forms,

01:30:41.287 --> 01:30:44.956
and I'll call you when the
doctor's ready for you.

01:31:10.950 --> 01:31:11.984
King?

01:31:24.498 --> 01:31:26.464
<i>What does he want?</i>

01:31:26.466 --> 01:31:29.069
<i>Two hundred and
forty 30-milligram Oxycodone.</i>

01:31:29.970 --> 01:31:32.437
One hundred and eighty
10-milligram Valium.

01:31:32.439 --> 01:31:35.375
Here, maybe it's easier
if I give it to you.

01:31:37.010 --> 01:31:38.510
This bag,
who do I give it to?

01:31:38.512 --> 01:31:40.080
You can leave that
with me.

01:32:31.232 --> 01:32:32.998
Hello?

01:32:33.000 --> 01:32:35.335
<i>Hey, Ollie.
It's Sheila Andrews.</i>

01:32:35.337 --> 01:32:38.106
<i>We'd love you to come out
to Spokane and work with us.</i>

01:34:01.492 --> 01:34:03.394
I was wondering
where you'd run off to.

01:34:04.161 --> 01:34:05.729
Just here.

01:34:11.368 --> 01:34:12.403
You want one?

01:34:14.672 --> 01:34:16.106
Go on.

01:34:17.675 --> 01:34:20.044
Don't look so guilty.
You earned it.

01:34:27.284 --> 01:34:28.587
Good girl.

01:34:38.430 --> 01:34:40.430
How was your day?

01:34:40.432 --> 01:34:41.566
Uh...

01:34:43.268 --> 01:34:45.337
You know, the best part
about the day...

01:34:45.737 --> 01:34:47.305
is when it's over.

01:34:49.074 --> 01:34:50.642
I hear that.

01:34:52.611 --> 01:34:54.045
I'm done.

01:34:55.547 --> 01:34:57.415
Done with all of it.

01:35:00.619 --> 01:35:02.220
You're leaving.

01:35:03.689 --> 01:35:06.224
You're gonna be okay,
Bear.

01:35:06.792 --> 01:35:08.293
I don't know.

01:35:09.127 --> 01:35:10.463
Come on.

01:35:11.697 --> 01:35:14.798
- You've got college.
- Yeah, if I ace the entrance exam.

01:35:14.800 --> 01:35:16.101
Which you will.

01:35:18.271 --> 01:35:19.672
You're gonna have
the house.

01:35:20.239 --> 01:35:21.440
Yeah.

01:35:22.775 --> 01:35:25.678
You've got the cutest little boy
ever, who loves you to bits.

01:35:29.815 --> 01:35:31.350
You've got me.

01:35:38.190 --> 01:35:40.593
You're not allowed to
really grow old without me.

01:35:41.795 --> 01:35:43.095
Okay?

01:35:45.531 --> 01:35:46.667
Okay.

01:35:50.871 --> 01:35:52.706
You know that
I love you, right?

01:35:57.578 --> 01:35:59.379
I love you, too.

01:36:05.319 --> 01:36:06.787
Yeah.

01:36:07.588 --> 01:36:08.622
Okay.
