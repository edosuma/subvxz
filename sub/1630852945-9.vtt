WEBVTT

00:06.042 --> 00:07.281
I heard about Kev.

00:07.366 --> 00:08.844
You don't know
what really happened.

00:08.929 --> 00:11.141
- No?
- You didn't shoot and kill

00:11.250 --> 00:12.344
my baby brother?

00:12.429 --> 00:13.843
Kev was my family, too,

00:13.945 --> 00:15.032
and I ain't got much left.

00:15.117 --> 00:17.204
We can squash this beef here,
right now.

00:17.306 --> 00:18.398
<i>He's gonna use his connect</i>

00:18.483 --> 00:19.666
to start at ten keys a week.

00:19.751 --> 00:21.251
So you got him
making money for you now?

00:21.335 --> 00:22.419
Makes the world go round.

00:22.521 --> 00:24.063
- And you trust him?
- End of the day,

00:24.148 --> 00:25.782
he just want to look out
for his family.

00:25.867 --> 00:27.539
<i>I want to buy directly from you.</i>

00:27.624 --> 00:28.836
Franklin know about this?

00:28.982 --> 00:30.046
No.

00:30.162 --> 00:31.461
Franklin is the answer.

00:31.609 --> 00:34.023
In the end, only he can bring
your enemies down.

00:34.156 --> 00:35.430
There's gonna be a wedding.

00:37.599 --> 00:40.359
Did you dose everybody
with LSD?

00:43.174 --> 00:45.774
You can't be a gangster
and a family man.

00:45.878 --> 00:47.429
In the end, you'll have
to destroy us all.

00:47.513 --> 00:49.446
And all you
have to offer is lies.

00:49.548 --> 00:50.780
Dripped with honey.

00:50.883 --> 00:52.849
You think
you have to kill me one day.

00:52.951 --> 00:54.782
But before you do,
I'm gonna kill you.

00:54.867 --> 00:56.871
There's only one
thing you really need to know.

00:56.955 --> 00:58.485
Once you press that button,

00:58.570 --> 01:00.090
there's no turning back.

01:00.192 --> 01:02.159
<i> You were
right, I should've listened.</i>

01:02.261 --> 01:03.845
<i>I should've treated you
like a partner.</i>

01:03.929 --> 01:06.015
<i>You know, it's not too late.</i>

01:06.406 --> 01:07.688
It is.

01:07.773 --> 01:10.507
<i>I've got to follow
my own path now.</i>

01:46.344 --> 01:47.376
Hey.

01:49.078 --> 01:51.078
How you holding up?

01:52.227 --> 01:54.161
How would you be?

01:55.109 --> 01:57.203
Kovatch is itching
to talk to you.

01:57.288 --> 01:58.960
Thought maybe
you'd want to run me through

01:59.045 --> 02:00.648
what happened here first.

02:06.015 --> 02:07.539
You know, we got a tip that

02:07.624 --> 02:10.382
<i>cocaine was being sold out
of the pool hall, so we came</i>

02:10.467 --> 02:12.167
<i>to check it out.</i>

02:14.917 --> 02:17.054
<i>They just started shooting.</i>

02:17.230 --> 02:18.596
Oh, shit, five-o!

02:20.888 --> 02:22.448
<i>And how'd you
end up in the back?</i>

02:22.734 --> 02:24.434
<i>One of them ran.</i>

02:25.695 --> 02:27.406
<i>I warned him repeatedly to stop.</i>

02:27.491 --> 02:28.921
<i>Damn, bruh!</i>

02:29.023 --> 02:31.234
<i>He had a gun in his hand.</i>

02:31.319 --> 02:33.219
Aah!

02:34.098 --> 02:36.265
<i>He was turning back to fire.</i>

02:38.312 --> 02:39.990
<i>And, uh...</i>

02:40.099 --> 02:42.456
<i>11-99. Perez is hit!</i>

02:42.541 --> 02:44.274
<i>Repeat, Perez is down!</i>

02:47.820 --> 02:49.854
That's when I saw him.

02:57.743 --> 03:00.377
Okay.

03:01.194 --> 03:03.632
Kovatch is gonna want
to hear that from you.

03:03.984 --> 03:05.998
Then you got to go in,

03:06.083 --> 03:07.983
give an official statement.

03:12.570 --> 03:14.448
Hey, the guy in the back.

03:14.533 --> 03:15.932
He make it?

03:16.522 --> 03:18.328
He's barely hanging on.

03:18.413 --> 03:20.054
Took him over to king.

03:27.274 --> 03:29.274

04:10.144 --> 04:11.468
Who?

04:13.687 --> 04:15.351
Oh, oh, yeah.

04:15.436 --> 04:16.921
Yeah, send him up.

04:17.983 --> 04:19.507
Thanks.

04:30.442 --> 04:32.554
- What's up?
- Sup?

04:33.046 --> 04:34.304
Welcome.

04:40.780 --> 04:42.070
Shit.

04:46.258 --> 04:48.125
Look at this place.

04:51.166 --> 04:53.062
Been meaning to have you over.

04:54.066 --> 04:56.007
Been paging you all morning.

04:57.101 --> 04:58.859
Yeah.

04:58.944 --> 05:00.859
Couldn't sleep, man.

05:01.286 --> 05:03.719
You know, mind was
just racing on me.

05:04.462 --> 05:06.296
Feel like I've been carved out.

05:06.515 --> 05:08.812
I was actually feeling
pretty good.

05:10.007 --> 05:12.141
Went to the crib,
poured a drink.

05:12.226 --> 05:14.453
Watched the sun rise
on the roof.

05:14.687 --> 05:17.020
Like I finally knew
what I had to do.

05:17.333 --> 05:20.226
Then I got word cops hit
the pool hall.

05:20.789 --> 05:22.445
Three of Kane people dead.

05:22.530 --> 05:23.909
Kane in surgery.

05:24.129 --> 05:25.996
Want to guess who it was?

05:26.648 --> 05:28.131
Hmm?

05:30.007 --> 05:31.534
She lied to us.

05:32.171 --> 05:33.269
Said shit was fine.

05:33.354 --> 05:35.487
And went behind our backs
and hit 'em anyway.

05:37.309 --> 05:39.576
What you want me
to do about it, Lee?

05:40.265 --> 05:41.695
What?

05:44.066 --> 05:46.109
What would you like me to do?

05:47.687 --> 05:49.419
Yell and scream?

05:50.328 --> 05:51.937
Shoot up the club?

05:52.079 --> 05:54.429
Go to war with Louie and Jerome?

05:54.717 --> 05:56.593
- The cops?
- There's what's right

05:56.764 --> 05:58.455
and there's what's wrong,
and this shit is wrong.

05:58.539 --> 06:00.697
Yeah, well,
Kane tried to kill us.

06:00.799 --> 06:02.032
Jerome and Louie hit back.

06:02.134 --> 06:03.233
We made a deal with Kane.

06:03.342 --> 06:05.389
That's what's right
in our world.

06:05.570 --> 06:07.771
I ain't saying
I'm happy with any of it.

06:09.007 --> 06:10.206
But there's other shit that's

06:10.308 --> 06:11.490
more important to me, man.

06:11.575 --> 06:13.043
Like what?

06:13.145 --> 06:15.178
Like surviving.

06:16.604 --> 06:19.529
Surviving to take care
of my unborn baby.

06:20.598 --> 06:22.831
Like not going to war
with my family.

06:24.948 --> 06:26.614
I can't tell you
what to do any more

06:26.699 --> 06:28.666
than I can Jerome and Louie.

06:28.894 --> 06:30.373
That's a first.

06:32.074 --> 06:34.008
But I ain't going out a martyr.

06:35.506 --> 06:36.900
Nah, you're going out here.

06:37.881 --> 06:38.961
In your Wilshire penthouse.

06:39.123 --> 06:40.904
Look, if...

06:41.397 --> 06:42.904
If you're trying
to make me feel bad,

06:42.989 --> 06:44.959
that's not the way, all right?

06:45.210 --> 06:47.610
Now, you want to fight this,
be my guest.

06:47.939 --> 06:49.939
But I won't be there.

06:56.810 --> 06:58.843
You ain't even open it, huh?

07:12.818 --> 07:14.651
You are so beautiful.

07:19.352 --> 07:21.311
Was it everything
that you wanted?

07:21.432 --> 07:23.465
Mm-hmm.

07:24.172 --> 07:25.405
All that

07:25.507 --> 07:27.803
and a chocolate fountain of LSD.

07:29.842 --> 07:31.508
Probably skully.

07:31.682 --> 07:33.314
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

07:33.399 --> 07:35.217
It probably was.

07:35.430 --> 07:37.725
That shit could've gone
all wrong.

07:38.061 --> 07:39.165
Yeah.

07:39.250 --> 07:40.748
But it didn't.

07:42.042 --> 07:43.850
Maybe it's a good omen.

07:44.244 --> 07:45.725
Mm-hmm.

07:47.061 --> 07:49.714
Word's probably out
about Kane by now.

07:50.899 --> 07:52.350
I know.

07:53.544 --> 07:55.467
Checked my pager this morning.

07:55.583 --> 07:58.904
- And?
- Five missed from Leon.

08:01.495 --> 08:04.029
I wish we could just stay
in bed all day.

08:06.529 --> 08:08.296
We can.

08:09.013 --> 08:10.936
- We can?
- Mm-hmm.

08:11.104 --> 08:13.738
- We can.
- Let's just stay in bed all day.

08:13.840 --> 08:15.639
Yeah.

08:18.378 --> 08:20.611
Oh, no.

08:22.266 --> 08:23.693
No.

08:23.778 --> 08:26.078
Shit needs to be dealt with.

08:26.443 --> 08:28.486
I'll tell you what.

08:28.850 --> 08:31.522
- I'll call downstairs.
- Mm-hmm?

08:31.607 --> 08:33.272
Extend our stay

08:33.668 --> 08:35.833
till Wednesday before the trip.

08:37.475 --> 08:39.981
Then we come back here
later tonight.

08:41.900 --> 08:44.374
I like it.

08:44.459 --> 08:46.337
You ever gonna tell me
where we going?

08:46.748 --> 08:48.309
I mean, you're gonna know
in a few days,

08:48.408 --> 08:49.225
that's all I know.

08:49.310 --> 08:51.277
You just like seeing me squirm,
that's all.

08:51.407 --> 08:53.007
I fucking love you.

08:53.289 --> 08:56.097
- I love you.
- I like it when you say that.

08:56.325 --> 08:57.968
Say it again.

08:58.251 --> 09:00.651
- You like it?
- Mm-hmm.

09:06.867 --> 09:09.000
Anything else I should know?

09:09.399 --> 09:10.983
Um...

09:11.358 --> 09:13.257
No, it's all there.

09:13.779 --> 09:15.326
Just like I said.

09:15.411 --> 09:17.252
And the cocaine
you got the tip about

09:17.337 --> 09:19.370
in the first place?

09:20.182 --> 09:22.217
Bad information, right?

09:23.476 --> 09:24.990
It happens.

09:25.075 --> 09:26.936
yeah?

09:27.981 --> 09:29.303
Come on in.

09:38.514 --> 09:41.192
Kind of need to pull
a tube of blood, detective.

09:41.592 --> 09:42.983
Are you serious?

09:43.068 --> 09:45.178
As of right now,
you are suspended,

09:45.263 --> 09:46.399
pending results

09:46.484 --> 09:48.584
of I.A.'s investigation
into the shooting

09:48.681 --> 09:50.214
and these test results.

09:50.299 --> 09:52.381
So you tell us to clean shit up,

09:52.670 --> 09:55.076
and suddenly you give
a fuck about how it gets done?

09:55.161 --> 09:57.128
An officer is dead,
and I want to know why.

09:57.213 --> 09:58.818
Or is it just me, huh?

09:59.913 --> 10:02.213
'Cause I ain't some six-foot-two

10:02.315 --> 10:03.865
square-jawed southern boy.

10:03.950 --> 10:05.217
"Yes, sir, no, sir,

10:05.302 --> 10:07.537
shine your shoes for you, sir?"

10:13.138 --> 10:15.171
I shine my own shoes.

10:16.644 --> 10:18.747
And I clean up after myself.

10:18.964 --> 10:20.997
You should've done the same.

10:27.302 --> 10:29.449
Fuck this. I want my union rep.

10:29.534 --> 10:31.134
I want my fucking lawyer
in here.

10:31.244 --> 10:32.710
Refuse to cooperate,
and there'll be

10:32.812 --> 10:35.374
criminal charges to go
along with the disgrace.

10:35.459 --> 10:36.803
In the meantime, I'm gonna need

10:36.895 --> 10:38.787
your gun and badge, detective.

10:44.733 --> 10:46.524
All right.

10:55.492 --> 10:57.615
I know you
don't want to hear it, but...

10:59.234 --> 11:01.740
...I understand
why Louie did what she did.

11:05.040 --> 11:07.207
Right thing, the wrong way.

11:10.990 --> 11:13.678
Who doses an entire wedding?

11:14.058 --> 11:16.959
What if I'd have stayed,
huh, eaten a strawberry?

11:17.044 --> 11:19.111
I don't even want
to think about it.

11:20.459 --> 11:21.967
You could've called me,
you know.

11:22.052 --> 11:23.779
If you were in such bad shape.

11:25.532 --> 11:27.233
Oh, we talked.

11:28.440 --> 11:30.764
Had a whole conversation.

11:33.490 --> 11:34.972
Hmm.

11:35.074 --> 11:36.811
What did we talk about?

11:38.511 --> 11:40.420
Hey, you want
to get out of here?

11:40.505 --> 11:42.505
Like, leave town?

11:43.717 --> 11:45.483
I just want to clear my head.

11:46.709 --> 11:48.619
What'd you have in mind?

11:55.423 --> 11:57.451
You shaved your beard.

11:57.880 --> 11:59.623
In light of last night,
I thought

11:59.837 --> 12:02.100
it would be helpful
to alter my appearance.

12:02.638 --> 12:04.238
I was thinking those things
you were saying

12:04.322 --> 12:05.720
are closer to the truth
than not.

12:05.805 --> 12:07.038
I was drugged.

12:07.170 --> 12:09.873
I was scared.
Fuck, I'm still scared.

12:10.186 --> 12:11.428
I'm sorry.

12:11.513 --> 12:13.506
You know what you should be
scared of, cissy?

12:14.514 --> 12:16.186
What the CIA is gonna do

12:16.271 --> 12:18.204
to your son if I don't help you.

12:18.951 --> 12:20.873
Because when they're done
with him,

12:21.084 --> 12:22.386
they will kill him.

12:22.488 --> 12:23.748
That's a fact.

12:23.833 --> 12:26.234
Right now you think
you have two bad choices.

12:26.461 --> 12:29.562
But I'm the only hope you have
to save Franklin.

12:33.998 --> 12:36.732
Ana told me what you were like
when she recruited you.

12:37.522 --> 12:38.936
Alone.

12:39.108 --> 12:41.162
Desperate to find a
man who was gone forever.

12:41.247 --> 12:42.502
Okay.
I don't need to be

12:42.587 --> 12:44.916
- reminded of that right now.
- No, I think you do.

12:45.963 --> 12:48.502
And I think you need to put away
these childish excuses

12:48.587 --> 12:50.465
if you want to have
any hope of killing Teddy

12:50.550 --> 12:53.275
- and getting you out of this alive.
- Wait a goddamn second.

12:53.360 --> 12:55.303
Short of incriminating
my own son,

12:55.388 --> 12:57.121
I have done everything

12:57.223 --> 12:58.489
that you have asked me to do.

12:58.666 --> 12:59.869
You, on the other hand,

12:59.954 --> 13:01.809
have given me
no reason to believe

13:01.894 --> 13:04.495
that you can do what you said
you were gonna do.

13:05.041 --> 13:06.831
Now, both Teddy's drug runner

13:06.933 --> 13:08.760
and gun supplier
were there yesterday.

13:09.327 --> 13:11.361
Tell me you got something
we can use.

13:12.733 --> 13:15.603
Could've gotten more
if you had kept your head.

13:17.525 --> 13:18.955
But yes.

13:19.458 --> 13:21.674
Ultimately,
it was incredibly helpful.

13:22.414 --> 13:24.348
My people are digging
into Gustavo zapata

13:24.433 --> 13:26.345
and avi drexler as we speak.

13:29.101 --> 13:31.835
But whatever reservations
you have,

13:32.445 --> 13:34.822
you leave them here today.

13:35.561 --> 13:38.002
Or I will leave you back
the way you were in Cuba.

13:46.354 --> 13:48.150
Avi.

13:50.497 --> 13:52.213
Whoa.

13:52.702 --> 13:55.533
Oh, oh, goodness.

13:57.984 --> 14:00.283
Who might we have here?

14:02.632 --> 14:05.102
Avi, meet parissa,
it's an old acquaintance

14:05.220 --> 14:06.991
turned new associate.

14:07.093 --> 14:09.727
My dear, you are a vision.

14:09.829 --> 14:11.796
It's nice to meet you, avi.

14:11.898 --> 14:13.392
Persian, eh?

14:13.684 --> 14:15.260
Very good.

14:15.659 --> 14:17.986
I spent some time in Tehran

14:18.071 --> 14:19.537
back in the '70s.

14:19.654 --> 14:21.056
What a city.

14:21.141 --> 14:23.550
It makes me very
sad, you know, what's happening

14:23.635 --> 14:24.963
between our two countries.

14:25.048 --> 14:27.161
Ah, yeah, I couldn't agree more.

14:27.246 --> 14:28.946
And I'd like
to hear all of your thoughts

14:29.065 --> 14:30.135
on this matter.

14:30.220 --> 14:32.187
And I would like to tell you.

14:32.272 --> 14:35.140
But I think Theodore would like

14:35.225 --> 14:36.724
some time with you first.

14:36.809 --> 14:38.476
Then I guess Theodore

14:38.561 --> 14:40.360
and I should chat.

14:40.664 --> 14:42.291
- Muir?
- Hmm?

14:42.415 --> 14:44.267
All morning, we've been

14:44.352 --> 14:47.019
enjoying my cellar.

14:47.333 --> 14:49.867
Help yourself
to whatever you please.

14:49.952 --> 14:52.181
Thank you.

14:54.674 --> 14:57.007
Oh, to be a young man.

14:57.110 --> 14:59.135
You are a young man.

14:59.220 --> 15:00.520
Mm-hmm.

15:00.610 --> 15:02.676
I kept the party going.

15:02.990 --> 15:04.556
Someone spiked

15:04.641 --> 15:06.517
the entire Saint wedding

15:06.602 --> 15:08.650
with LSD last night.

15:09.020 --> 15:11.885
Seriously?
Was it you?

15:12.299 --> 15:14.002
Not this time.

15:16.462 --> 15:17.963
Okay.

15:18.048 --> 15:21.385
I'm not gonna, uh, take up
too much of your time.

15:21.868 --> 15:24.478
I am about to be
in a position to triple

15:24.595 --> 15:26.121
the number of guns
that are headed south.

15:26.205 --> 15:28.339
I need to know that you can
handle that kind of weight.

15:28.423 --> 15:30.089
When have I ever let you down?

15:30.174 --> 15:31.807
Honestly, avi, all the time.

15:31.892 --> 15:33.775
There were always good reasons
for any hiccups.

15:33.860 --> 15:36.297
This is it, it's the final push.

15:36.791 --> 15:38.215
The sandinistas are hurting.

15:38.317 --> 15:40.939
This will break their back.
I want this war sewn up.

15:41.024 --> 15:43.627
On to bigger
and better things, eh?

15:44.095 --> 15:45.222
Triple the guns

15:45.324 --> 15:47.385
in 60 days... say you can do it.

15:47.736 --> 15:49.627
You have the money,
you'll have the guns,

15:49.729 --> 15:52.056
I swear, but I do hope

15:52.141 --> 15:54.007
the end of this war
will not mean

15:54.092 --> 15:55.908
the end of our business?

15:59.352 --> 16:01.290
With everything you know about
me, and you really don't think

16:01.374 --> 16:03.153
there's gonna be another war
just around the corner?

16:06.255 --> 16:07.721
Come have a drink.

16:07.847 --> 16:09.880
- Come on.
- If you say so.

16:27.147 --> 16:28.681
How is he?

16:30.120 --> 16:31.687
He's fucked up.

16:31.851 --> 16:33.250
Bullet got his spine.

16:33.439 --> 16:35.072
Doc said he ain't walking again.

16:35.165 --> 16:36.517
Fuck.

16:38.594 --> 16:40.294
But he's gonna live?

16:40.914 --> 16:41.976
I'm gonna assume

16:42.061 --> 16:43.894
that you didn't know
anything about this?

16:44.068 --> 16:46.775
That this was just cops
being cops?

16:46.869 --> 16:48.709
Or is there some shit
that you want to tell me?

16:56.409 --> 16:58.619
You can't be fucking serious.

16:58.737 --> 17:00.268
Okay, okay.

17:00.353 --> 17:02.306
Yeah, I came here
for a little compassion.

17:02.782 --> 17:04.174
Why did I think
I'd get anything

17:04.259 --> 17:06.539
- but a world of shit from you?
- I'm sorry Eddie is dead,

17:06.635 --> 17:08.111
okay, I am.

17:08.512 --> 17:10.252
But I'm not letting you see them

17:10.337 --> 17:12.557
- when you're in this state.
- What state, Sharon? I'm upset.

17:12.641 --> 17:14.406
Come on,
you're fucking high, Beau!

17:14.499 --> 17:15.549
You think I don't see it?

17:15.682 --> 17:17.215
I want to see my fucking kids.
- You think I don't know?

17:17.300 --> 17:19.233
- And I'm not gonna say it again.
- Or what?

17:21.786 --> 17:23.551
You gonna hit me?

17:23.637 --> 17:24.760
Hmm?

17:26.426 --> 17:27.727
After they find cocaine

17:27.811 --> 17:30.413
or-or whatever it is you're on
in your blood?

17:30.894 --> 17:33.431
You want to make sure
you never see your kids again?

17:34.060 --> 17:36.150
That's the way
to make sure it happens.

17:36.454 --> 17:38.361
And I know
because I spend all day

17:38.446 --> 17:40.980
keeping assholes like you
away from their kids.

17:42.393 --> 17:44.845
Now get the fuck out of here.

17:48.920 --> 17:50.908
Get the fuck out.

18:19.511 --> 18:20.580
It's okay.

18:20.665 --> 18:22.181
I'll be out in a minute.

18:23.410 --> 18:25.322
So this is how you move now?

18:25.407 --> 18:27.473
Say one thing, do another?

18:30.477 --> 18:31.943
I told you how I felt.

18:32.101 --> 18:33.439
You felt differently.

18:33.533 --> 18:35.156
So I did what I needed to do.

18:35.241 --> 18:36.994
Just tell me why.

18:37.408 --> 18:38.917
Make me understand how this is

18:39.002 --> 18:40.446
one thing that needed to happen?

18:42.025 --> 18:43.416
I can try.

18:43.510 --> 18:45.463
But you ain't gonna hear it.

18:47.180 --> 18:48.620
You think it's hard being
a black man

18:48.715 --> 18:50.382
in this world, Leon?

18:50.525 --> 18:51.783
Try for five minutes

18:51.885 --> 18:53.451
living in it as a black woman.

18:53.553 --> 18:56.870
Every move I make got to be
iron-fucking-clad,

18:56.955 --> 19:00.072
or these niggas is gonna
chew me up and spit me out.

19:00.814 --> 19:02.471
And that ain't happening to me.

19:02.556 --> 19:04.128
So, yeah, I looked you

19:04.213 --> 19:05.797
in your face,
told you I was fine,

19:05.899 --> 19:08.275
and then I sent Buckley
to kill Kane.

19:09.110 --> 19:11.463
'Cause to be where I want to be,

19:11.775 --> 19:13.119
I don't got the luxury

19:13.206 --> 19:15.948
of somebody taking a shot at me
and letting it go.

19:16.033 --> 19:18.652
- What about black diamond?
- Black diamond and Dallas could be bought.

19:18.736 --> 19:20.987
Y'all killed Kane's brother.

19:21.416 --> 19:23.846
So a little money
gonna keep him happy

19:23.931 --> 19:25.939
for a little while, but one day

19:26.181 --> 19:27.995
he gonna come back
to finish what he started.

19:28.088 --> 19:29.754
- You don't know that.
- What I know is,

19:29.856 --> 19:31.800
I spent half
my life getting fucked

19:31.885 --> 19:33.707
over by niggas like him.

19:33.794 --> 19:36.094
And like I said before,
that ain't happening again.

19:36.228 --> 19:38.431
If you can't understand that,
Leon,

19:38.736 --> 19:40.683
it ain't nothing left
for us to talk about.

19:41.072 --> 19:43.134
Look, I just left the hospital.

19:43.236 --> 19:45.713
Kane's people ain't gonna
take this lying down.

19:45.931 --> 19:47.490
Now I didn't tell 'em
it was you behind this,

19:47.574 --> 19:48.958
'cause I don't want
more blood on my hands.

19:49.042 --> 19:51.072
But eventually
they gonna find out.

19:51.157 --> 19:54.158
And I hope you ready
for what's coming.

20:00.963 --> 20:03.345

20:17.126 --> 20:18.687
Good over there?

20:18.772 --> 20:21.041
I don't know if this was
such a good idea.

20:21.728 --> 20:23.424
Got any of those bags around?

20:24.277 --> 20:26.711
- You can use your purse.
- Mm-mm.

20:26.813 --> 20:28.213
Not this purse, nigga.

20:30.174 --> 20:31.964

and a family man
at the same time.

21:25.205 --> 21:27.238
That I'd lose you.

21:29.311 --> 21:31.811
Or you'd betray me
to save yourself.

21:33.736 --> 21:35.463
That what you really think?

21:35.849 --> 21:38.116
I think I haven't
been honest with you, v.

21:40.519 --> 21:42.697
And I don't want to lie anymore.

21:45.431 --> 21:48.463
The truth is,
I've done terrible things.

21:50.752 --> 21:52.630
I've killed people.

21:53.439 --> 21:55.103
Destroyed lives.

21:57.904 --> 22:02.002
Whatever I had to,
not just to survive but to win.

22:03.900 --> 22:05.595
And last night

22:05.812 --> 22:08.049
I saw the simple truth.

22:09.172 --> 22:11.635
That by any measure...

22:15.954 --> 22:17.830
...I'm a monster.

22:26.498 --> 22:28.699
When I was 13...

22:30.588 --> 22:33.135
...My mom and I were
in El Paso,

22:33.267 --> 22:35.595
running one of the usual scams.

22:36.409 --> 22:37.809
Normally we were gone

22:37.911 --> 22:39.712
before the Mark ever knew
what hit 'em, but...

22:40.006 --> 22:41.973
This one guy, he sniffed it out.

22:42.066 --> 22:44.345
He flew into a rage.

22:45.369 --> 22:46.807
You Rob someone straight up,

22:46.892 --> 22:48.588
that's one thing.

22:48.997 --> 22:50.448
You make them believe you care

22:50.533 --> 22:52.257
and then clean 'em out?

22:55.556 --> 22:57.328
He'd already knocked
my mother unconscious.

22:57.588 --> 22:59.478
He had his hands around my neck.

23:00.322 --> 23:03.275
And the world was going dark.

23:04.704 --> 23:07.369
I didn't even see her get up.

23:08.159 --> 23:10.025
I just heard the shot.

23:10.573 --> 23:13.431
My mom, she helped me up,
told me, "stop crying."

23:13.666 --> 23:14.864
She helped me change my clothes,

23:14.948 --> 23:17.148
and then we left the country.

23:19.241 --> 23:22.197
I am the girl who lied

23:22.322 --> 23:24.494
and cheated and stole

23:24.916 --> 23:28.059
and left a man dead
on a hotel room floor.

23:30.530 --> 23:32.901
I'm also the woman
who went to college

23:32.986 --> 23:34.474
and law school...

23:34.863 --> 23:37.720
And moved to L.A. And met a man

23:38.205 --> 23:39.689
and fell in love.

23:42.809 --> 23:45.009
It's not the same thing, v.

23:46.780 --> 23:48.913
I knew you were
a killer, Franklin.

23:51.455 --> 23:53.050
But I also believed you
when you said

23:53.135 --> 23:54.193
you wanted out.

23:54.287 --> 23:55.553
That you wanted to change.

23:55.655 --> 23:57.080
I do.

23:58.502 --> 24:00.625
But what if I was wrong?

24:00.727 --> 24:02.360
What if it's...

24:02.462 --> 24:04.213
It's too late?

24:05.193 --> 24:07.111
Then you'd better win.

24:42.369 --> 24:44.168
I heard it was a wild one.

24:44.270 --> 24:46.486
yeah, things
got a little out of hand.

24:46.650 --> 24:48.473
Well, you don't look
any worse for the wear.

24:48.575 --> 24:50.470
It was one of the best nights
of my life.

24:50.563 --> 24:52.627
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

24:56.970 --> 24:59.533
So, uh, Jerome couldn't
make it, huh?

24:59.619 --> 25:01.519
No, he had other business.

25:01.621 --> 25:04.401
He probably won't be making
a lot of these drops,

25:04.486 --> 25:05.753
- to be honest.
- Listen, I don't see him here,

25:05.837 --> 25:07.111
I don't want to see anybody.

25:07.587 --> 25:08.447
I don't go nowhere

25:08.532 --> 25:10.065
- without my security.
- You do now.

25:10.323 --> 25:11.965
No security,
nobody I don't know.

25:12.050 --> 25:13.450
And you can thank Franklin
for that.

25:13.535 --> 25:15.002
You tell him yet, by the way?

25:15.087 --> 25:16.419
Not yet.

25:16.504 --> 25:18.369
Give me a heads-up when you do.

25:18.852 --> 25:20.752
Oh, when do you leave
for the honeymoon?

25:20.854 --> 25:21.885
Couple days.

25:21.970 --> 25:23.937
We'll be back in time
for the next drop.

25:24.022 --> 25:26.055
- Have a good time.
- Mm-hmm.

25:27.558 --> 25:29.491
Happy for you guys.

25:34.849 --> 25:37.049
drive?

25:47.502 --> 25:49.017
You think it's smart selling

25:49.102 --> 25:51.056
to both sides of the family?

25:56.268 --> 25:58.668
A blood feud is no good
for anyone.

25:59.265 --> 26:00.994
I'm sorry, a "blood feud"?

26:01.079 --> 26:02.244
Yeah.

26:02.336 --> 26:03.636
Franklin's not the kind of guy

26:03.739 --> 26:05.338
to start a "blood feud."

26:06.548 --> 26:07.922
Why?

26:08.015 --> 26:10.400
Do you know something
about him I don't?

26:10.566 --> 26:11.932
He's young.

26:12.017 --> 26:13.483
Has his pride and...

26:13.769 --> 26:15.802
This will wound it.

26:20.223 --> 26:22.072
He'll get over it.

26:24.190 --> 26:25.697
Or he won't.

26:36.401 --> 26:38.144
<i>Don't let Central America be</i>

26:38.228 --> 26:39.280
<i>another Vietnam.
That would...</i>

26:41.885 --> 26:44.452
oh, shit.

26:59.601 --> 27:01.634
Hey, let me get 20?

27:04.553 --> 27:06.586
That ain't me.

27:07.799 --> 27:09.578
The fuck it ain't...
Let me get 20.

27:09.680 --> 27:11.416
Nigga, fuck you.

27:12.080 --> 27:13.999
Think I can't smell that bacon?

27:14.924 --> 27:16.785
Walk your ass on out of here.

27:24.186 --> 27:25.752
Fuck you doing, man?!

27:25.852 --> 27:27.253
I was gonna pay for it!

27:27.338 --> 27:29.011
- Now I'm gonna just take it!
- <i>The fuck you doing, man?</i>

27:29.095 --> 27:30.831
- Somebody shoot this motherfucker!
- Hey, shut the fuck up!

27:30.915 --> 27:32.697
<i>Hey, hold-hold-hold-hold up.</i>

27:34.191 --> 27:36.470
Y'all gonna give me this rock?!

27:37.455 --> 27:39.978
Or do y'all want to watch
his head get blown off?

27:41.812 --> 27:45.439
What's it gonna be?!
What's it gonna be?!

27:47.021 --> 27:49.088
Man, get the fuck
over there, man.

28:00.275 --> 28:02.308
Was that so hard?

28:06.625 --> 28:09.726
Thought maybe cissy would've
moved back in by now.

28:10.967 --> 28:13.591
I think she's still living
at some hotel.

28:16.873 --> 28:19.206
I thought maybe we should
talk about last night.

28:22.498 --> 28:24.100
Yeah.

28:24.185 --> 28:25.494
You was fucking on one.

28:25.675 --> 28:27.186
Said some things.

28:27.290 --> 28:29.024
Sure did.

28:29.126 --> 28:31.760
I came here to let you know

28:31.862 --> 28:33.995
that I meant every word of it.

28:37.271 --> 28:39.034
Which part exactly?

28:39.521 --> 28:41.336
Getting away.

28:41.438 --> 28:43.471
Europe, Africa.

28:46.341 --> 28:48.065
And you coming with me.

28:51.841 --> 28:53.014
I don't know, Lee.

28:53.116 --> 28:54.154
Why not?

28:54.396 --> 28:56.944
To start,
I finally got a good job.

28:57.029 --> 28:58.552
Just getting
my life back on track.

28:58.637 --> 28:59.975
I bet if you ask, the job will

29:00.060 --> 29:01.040
still be here when you get back.

29:01.124 --> 29:02.891
Okay, and if they say yeah,

29:03.011 --> 29:05.100
I ain't got no money saved up,
don't got a passport...

29:05.184 --> 29:06.983
I got enough money
for the both of us.

29:07.197 --> 29:09.904
And you can get a passport
in 24 hours... I checked.

29:10.776 --> 29:12.849
Okay, yeah.

29:14.005 --> 29:15.794
But why me?

29:15.879 --> 29:17.312
lots of reasons.

29:18.047 --> 29:20.080
Like what?

29:21.125 --> 29:24.025
I just need to do some thinking
on what's next for me.

29:24.551 --> 29:26.413
How I'm gonna help our people.

29:27.786 --> 29:29.279
And you been through it,

29:29.513 --> 29:31.740
you understand
how people are hurting.

29:33.724 --> 29:35.748
So you want me
to just leave everything here

29:35.833 --> 29:37.125
so I can help you?

29:37.227 --> 29:39.115
Also to spend time with you.

29:39.404 --> 29:40.811
'Cause you're embarrassed
to be with me here.

29:40.895 --> 29:42.131
- No...
- You don't want to be with me here

29:42.215 --> 29:43.530
'cause of all the shit
I done while I was high?

29:43.614 --> 29:44.639
No.

29:51.272 --> 29:53.305
Truth is...

29:54.801 --> 29:56.835
...I still love you, Lee.

29:58.521 --> 30:01.748
- I just, I can't...
- Listen to me.

30:02.630 --> 30:05.029
Last night,
I saw everything clear.

30:06.622 --> 30:08.655
You're the only girl
I've ever loved.

30:12.436 --> 30:14.232
Come away with me.

30:15.963 --> 30:18.693
Then we can see if we can
get back what we had.

30:21.472 --> 30:23.505
Come here.

30:33.316 --> 30:36.255
You think
it's gonna come to that?

30:36.685 --> 30:37.819
Hope not.

30:37.966 --> 30:40.163
But I ain't taking no chances.

30:40.257 --> 30:42.357
I think you should get rid
of his ass either way.

30:43.143 --> 30:45.076
Put a lot
into that motherfucker.

30:45.537 --> 30:47.938
If I got to kill a cop
and go get another one...

30:48.404 --> 30:49.564
I will.

30:50.544 --> 30:52.216
But only if I have to.

30:53.793 --> 30:55.030
Come in.

30:57.541 --> 30:59.381
Um, he's downstairs.

30:59.466 --> 31:00.775
Do you want me to send him up?

31:00.877 --> 31:02.365
No, we gonna come down.

31:06.415 --> 31:08.081
- ♪<i> Are you ready?</i> ♪
- ♪<i> yeah!</i> ♪

31:08.166 --> 31:10.633
♪ <i>All right,</i>
<i>bump everybody in sight</i> ♪

31:13.616 --> 31:15.483
Auntie.

31:15.568 --> 31:16.983
Unc.

31:17.100 --> 31:19.826
Nephew. You good?

31:19.963 --> 31:21.850
better now that I'm not

31:21.935 --> 31:23.466
tripping my fucking balls off.

31:23.583 --> 31:24.899
Y'all?

31:25.001 --> 31:27.458
How's it feel, one day in?

31:27.755 --> 31:29.070
Mm, about the same.

31:29.172 --> 31:31.248
- Yeah.
- Well...

31:32.015 --> 31:34.216
I know y'all are technically
on your honeymoon,

31:34.326 --> 31:37.826
so I just wanted
to come through and...

31:39.382 --> 31:42.050
...Finish off the conversation
we had last night.

31:43.427 --> 31:45.396
Want you to know
I understand about Kane.

31:45.552 --> 31:47.739
And why you did what you did.

31:49.240 --> 31:50.919
It was your choice.

31:52.037 --> 31:53.623
I was wrong.

31:55.208 --> 31:57.165
Man enough to admit that I was.

31:58.146 --> 31:59.434
And for that, I'm sorry.

31:59.553 --> 32:01.193
Mm.

32:01.278 --> 32:03.222
I just want us to come
out of this in one piece.

32:03.306 --> 32:05.881
And I believe the best way
to do that is as a family, so...

32:05.966 --> 32:08.388
- We want the same thing, nephew.
- Good.

32:08.755 --> 32:10.178
Good.

32:10.280 --> 32:12.545
But... there's

32:12.630 --> 32:15.033
one thing you need to know
before we can make that happen.

32:15.466 --> 32:16.966
I approached Teddy.

32:17.065 --> 32:20.083
Made a deal to buy my cocaine
directly from him.

32:27.193 --> 32:29.177
You went to the plug
behind my back?

32:29.294 --> 32:32.567
We told you we wanted
to run our business our way.

32:32.669 --> 32:34.587
By completely destroying
my business in the process?

32:34.671 --> 32:37.467
- 90% of what I move is through you.
- Ah, we know that.

32:37.552 --> 32:39.717
But this country
is big enough for all of us.

32:39.802 --> 32:42.193
And most of our business is
coming from other cities anyway.

32:42.325 --> 32:44.846
- St. Louis, little rock.
- My expansion idea?

32:44.948 --> 32:46.347
Which we made happen.

32:46.449 --> 32:47.944
We understand your position.

32:48.029 --> 32:50.256
And we agreed to give you
one L.A. Territory

32:50.341 --> 32:52.553
of your choice...
Inglewood, Compton,

32:52.638 --> 32:54.349
whatever.

32:54.776 --> 32:57.110
you'd do that for me?

32:59.529 --> 33:01.396
We're trying to be reasonable.

33:01.498 --> 33:04.388
And what if I say
fuck your fucking reasons?

33:05.928 --> 33:07.228
Hmm?

33:34.315 --> 33:36.348
You wanted to be out in front.

33:40.993 --> 33:42.904
Now you are.

33:47.670 --> 33:49.388
Good luck.

33:57.967 --> 33:59.944
You could have just went
with Jerome.

34:00.029 --> 34:02.388
It's fine. I'll just finish
the schedule and I'll put it

34:02.473 --> 34:04.795
up there in the office,
along with where we're staying

34:04.880 --> 34:07.280
in case you need
anything at all.

34:07.365 --> 34:08.647
- I can handle it.
- Mm-hmm.

34:08.732 --> 34:11.293
You just have fun.

34:11.443 --> 34:13.607
- Thank you, chelle.
- You're welcome.

34:25.768 --> 34:28.002
Fuck, Beau.

34:29.289 --> 34:30.755
Hey, lo...

34:30.841 --> 34:33.255
The fuck I tell you
about being in my office?

34:36.145 --> 34:38.312
Oh, shit.

34:41.425 --> 34:43.692
You mind?

34:44.081 --> 34:48.052
Been paging your ass all day.

34:49.902 --> 34:51.803
You've been ducking me.

34:52.435 --> 34:53.952
I've been busy.

34:54.036 --> 34:56.404
Oh, yeah?
Doing what?

34:56.520 --> 34:58.453
Enjoying the day
after my wedding,

34:58.538 --> 35:00.247
for starters.

35:04.297 --> 35:06.297
I want the rest of my money.

35:06.524 --> 35:07.923
You'll get it.

35:08.008 --> 35:09.271
When the job is finished.

35:09.356 --> 35:10.833
"When the job is finished"?

35:10.918 --> 35:12.982
The deal was Kane dead.

35:13.219 --> 35:14.918
And he's not.

35:16.095 --> 35:18.521
- My partner got killed.
- That ain't my problem.

35:18.606 --> 35:21.091
They're gonna use this
to kick me off the force.

35:21.639 --> 35:23.216
Since when the LAPD give

35:23.301 --> 35:25.200
a fuck about niggas being
killed in the streets?

35:25.334 --> 35:27.901
Apparently, when it's a nigga
that did the killing.

35:28.300 --> 35:29.865
So, yeah, you see,

35:29.950 --> 35:33.021
I'm in a spot now,
and you put me here.

35:33.227 --> 35:34.044
You put yourself there.

35:34.129 --> 35:35.295
And now you're gonna
stand up there and say

35:35.379 --> 35:37.380
I'm not gonna get
my fucking money?

35:39.924 --> 35:42.291
Or maybe this whole thing
was just a setup.

35:43.758 --> 35:46.493
Maybe you were hoping that
bullet would catch me, huh?

35:46.658 --> 35:48.099
Why would I do that?

35:48.184 --> 35:49.951
Who knows?

35:50.266 --> 35:52.366
To get back at me
for the projects.

35:53.001 --> 35:55.165
Maybe you're just
a fucking bitch.

35:55.696 --> 35:57.599
But I lost my partner.

35:57.701 --> 35:59.259
I lost my job.

35:59.351 --> 36:01.454
And I might lose
my fucking kids.

36:05.758 --> 36:07.642
Can't lose my kids.

36:13.587 --> 36:15.550
You listen to me.

36:16.188 --> 36:18.251
Everything is gonna be okay.

36:20.715 --> 36:22.381
How?

36:22.466 --> 36:24.566
'Cause you ain't lose nothing.

36:24.889 --> 36:26.722
You just gained the life

36:26.807 --> 36:28.439
you were really meant to have.

36:28.599 --> 36:30.618
You got friends on the force?

36:30.901 --> 36:32.478
Connections.

36:32.563 --> 36:34.118
That makes you

36:34.203 --> 36:36.804
extremely valuable to me.

36:37.192 --> 36:38.782
Right?

36:39.500 --> 36:41.700
I'm gonna put you
on payroll full-time.

36:41.785 --> 36:44.298
Double what you were
making before.

36:45.076 --> 36:48.290
You got a home right here

36:48.375 --> 36:50.408
with us.

36:51.953 --> 36:54.407
So this ain't
the end of nothing.

36:59.093 --> 37:00.954
It's the beginning.

37:09.618 --> 37:11.418
You want to see?

37:12.181 --> 37:14.478
<i>Nyet, spasibo.</i>

37:14.563 --> 37:15.899
You sure?

37:16.437 --> 37:17.936
Okay.

37:18.515 --> 37:20.774
Do you know what is a "playboy"?

37:23.001 --> 37:25.220
A wealthy man who...

37:25.322 --> 37:28.251
Lives a life
of travel, leisure, women.

37:28.382 --> 37:30.415
Hmm.

37:31.543 --> 37:34.688
We don't even have a word
in Russian for such a man.

37:37.957 --> 37:39.673
- Okay.
- Hmm?

37:39.758 --> 37:41.358
I think we're clear.

37:42.015 --> 37:43.548
Let's go.

38:28.902 --> 38:30.465
Both of you,
hands up in the air!

38:30.600 --> 38:32.967
Slowly, motherfucker!

38:35.290 --> 38:37.113
I know you.

38:37.221 --> 38:38.535
I know you from some...

39:17.597 --> 39:20.137
<i>"Invincible"
by the thompsons playing...</i>

39:33.390 --> 39:34.723
Here's the thing.

39:34.808 --> 39:37.709
Sunday night in almost any
other town in this country,

39:38.031 --> 39:40.031
and everything's closed.

39:40.116 --> 39:41.364
Everyone's asleep in their beds.

39:41.448 --> 39:44.863
Yeah, there's
a lot of hustlers out here, man.

39:46.609 --> 39:48.843
But New York's the city
that never sleeps.

39:49.032 --> 39:50.582
What's Los Angeles?

39:50.667 --> 39:52.600
The city that sleeps in.

39:54.263 --> 39:55.988
Hi, could I get
a coffee, please?

39:56.073 --> 39:58.607
- Sure.
- Thank you. Actually...

39:58.692 --> 40:01.326
Sorry, uh... Do you have pie?

40:01.628 --> 40:03.961
Uh, sure do.
We have apple, pecan,

40:04.046 --> 40:06.146
chocolate cream,
and I think we still have

40:06.231 --> 40:07.535
a piece of BlackBerry cobbler.

40:07.620 --> 40:09.286
- Apple pie would be great.
- Yeah.

40:09.371 --> 40:12.080
Um, could you put
whipped cream on top?

40:12.165 --> 40:14.090
- Sure.
- Thank you.

40:15.190 --> 40:17.224
You're in a good mood.

40:19.143 --> 40:20.832
Yeah, I guess I...

40:20.948 --> 40:22.371
Maybe I am.

40:24.549 --> 40:26.527
Think I owe you an apology.

40:26.676 --> 40:29.213
Or at least an explanation
as to a certain phone call

40:29.298 --> 40:30.899
I may have made yesterday.

40:32.324 --> 40:33.798
A phone call?

40:35.896 --> 40:38.132
Are you talking about
when you threatened to kill me?

40:38.217 --> 40:39.850
Look, I was on drugs, man.

40:39.935 --> 40:41.402
Not in my right mind.

40:41.487 --> 40:43.220
yeah, I heard.

40:44.685 --> 40:47.419
Please tell me that you had,
like, a little bit of fun

40:47.504 --> 40:48.884
before the paranoia kicked in?

40:48.969 --> 40:50.903
Yeah, actually.

40:51.624 --> 40:53.557
The whole family was there.

40:54.517 --> 40:56.131
Everybody happy.

40:56.384 --> 40:57.485
No idea

40:57.570 --> 40:58.989
about the bomb
that was about to drop

40:59.073 --> 41:00.973
- in the middle of it all.
- Yeah.

41:01.058 --> 41:03.892
See, now I'm not sure if you're
talking about the acid or about

41:03.977 --> 41:06.353
me agreeing to do business
with Louie.

41:08.545 --> 41:10.431
Pie will be up in just a minute.

41:10.790 --> 41:12.981
Thanks.

41:19.111 --> 41:21.066
You know, I got to say,

41:21.829 --> 41:23.729
I didn't see that coming.

41:24.027 --> 41:25.504
You should know

41:25.589 --> 41:27.363
that my doing business
with her...

41:28.277 --> 41:30.098
- Not personal...
- Personal?

41:30.744 --> 41:32.270
Just business?

41:33.088 --> 41:34.910
You know how many times
I've used that line?

41:34.995 --> 41:36.207
That's why I'm hoping
you'll understand it.

41:36.291 --> 41:37.051
I mean, shit.

41:37.136 --> 41:38.536
This ain't about me and you,
right?

41:38.621 --> 41:40.287
It's about America,
it's about...

41:40.801 --> 41:42.262
- Winning a war.
- That's right.

41:42.347 --> 41:44.047
And to that point,
I did some thinking

41:44.132 --> 41:45.613
before I came here tonight.

41:46.748 --> 41:48.418
Did you know
in the last three years,

41:48.503 --> 41:50.503
I've made you almost $56 million

41:50.588 --> 41:51.840
to help win that war?

41:51.935 --> 41:54.738
During which time I've been
beaten, shot, imprisoned,

41:54.823 --> 41:56.254
killed people.

41:56.760 --> 41:58.560
Not to mention
unleashing a plague

41:58.645 --> 42:00.356
and selling out my own father.

42:01.089 --> 42:03.490
To keep your gravy train
flowing, of course.

42:03.575 --> 42:04.887
And you wanted it.

42:05.564 --> 42:06.738
Remember?

42:06.823 --> 42:08.289
Yeah, that's true.

42:08.512 --> 42:09.878
And this ain't charity work.

42:09.970 --> 42:12.301
You've taken home some
really nice hazard pay out

42:12.386 --> 42:14.981
- of the whole deal.
- I have. So we are in agreement

42:15.074 --> 42:17.642
that this unlikely partnership
has been more fruitful

42:17.727 --> 42:19.807
and productive than either
of us could have imagined.

42:19.915 --> 42:21.748
We've even had
what I'd like to think were

42:21.833 --> 42:24.066
a few genuine moments
of human connection.

42:24.151 --> 42:26.879
And I do genuinely hope
that you got everything

42:26.964 --> 42:28.465
you wanted out of it,

42:29.196 --> 42:31.530
squeezed every last drop.

42:33.323 --> 42:36.340
'Cause as of this moment,
our partnership is over.

42:40.837 --> 42:43.137
- Anything else I can get for you...?
- We're fine, thank you.

42:43.221 --> 42:44.761
Okay.

42:47.424 --> 42:49.136
Just because
I'm dealing with Louie

42:49.221 --> 42:50.887
does not mean
that you have to quit.

42:50.972 --> 42:52.668
You went behind my back, man.

42:52.753 --> 42:55.787
Undercut me to my biggest
customer, so, yeah, it does.

43:00.856 --> 43:02.481
I've got my money.

43:03.285 --> 43:05.393
Got my lady.

43:05.495 --> 43:07.262
Got a baby on the way.

43:07.926 --> 43:10.051
And I've done my patriotic duty,

43:10.136 --> 43:12.569
then some,
you know that, so I'm out.

43:13.348 --> 43:15.313
And, shit, maybe nobody
will know that a white boy

43:15.686 --> 43:17.543
from Kansas and a black kid
from south central

43:17.628 --> 43:19.928
changed the course
of history forever.
