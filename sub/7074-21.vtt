00:10.543 --> 00:12.110
I don't want to be late
for lunch.

00:12.178 --> 00:13.879
<i>"amar" is "to love," right?</i>

00:13.946 --> 00:15.613
Oh!
Speaking of love,

00:15.681 --> 00:18.082
Shirley, how's it going
with the sexy dreadlock guy?

00:18.150 --> 00:20.284
Oh, I'm sure I don't
have a chance with him.

00:20.352 --> 00:22.337
Abed and I talked to him
by the vending machines.

00:22.405 --> 00:23.740
He asked about you.

00:23.808 --> 00:25.029
He specifically asked about me?

00:25.097 --> 00:26.694
- Mm-hmm.
- Sure.

00:26.762 --> 00:28.028
When Annie brought you up,
he specifically asked,

00:28.095 --> 00:30.194
"who is that?"
Abed.

00:30.262 --> 00:32.295
- Oh.
- What? That's what he said.

00:32.362 --> 00:34.694
Abed, your social skills
aren't exactly streets ahead.

00:34.762 --> 00:36.328
You know what I mean?

00:36.395 --> 00:37.898
- I don't.
- You're not alone in this case.

00:37.966 --> 00:39.602
Pierce, stop trying
to coin the phrase,

00:39.670 --> 00:40.944
"streets ahead."

00:41.012 --> 00:43.145
Trying?

00:43.213 --> 00:45.315
Coined and minted.

00:45.382 --> 00:46.954
Been there, coined that.

00:47.022 --> 00:49.959
"streets ahead"
is verbal wildfire.

00:50.027 --> 00:51.662
Does it just mean "cool,"
or is it

00:51.730 --> 00:54.233
Supposed to be,
like, "miles ahead"?

00:54.301 --> 00:56.604
If you have to ask,
you're street's fine.

00:56.672 --> 00:58.476
Okay, we can banter
if we want to banter,

00:58.543 --> 01:00.645
But I'm warning you
I am leaving for lunch early.

01:00.713 --> 01:01.646
- Me too.
- Me three.

01:01.714 --> 01:02.848
Streets ahead.

01:02.917 --> 01:04.285
Man, you guys really love

01:04.352 --> 01:05.619
These stupid
chicken fingers, huh?

01:05.687 --> 01:07.321
Uh, they're not stupid.

01:07.389 --> 01:08.956
They're the only good thing
in the cafeteria.

01:09.024 --> 01:11.258
I haven't had one in weeks.
They run out so fast.

01:11.326 --> 01:13.295
If God were edible--
not that I'm catholic,

01:13.363 --> 01:14.430
But if it was cool to eat God,

01:14.498 --> 01:15.631
He'd be a chicken finger.

01:15.699 --> 01:16.833
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm-hmm.

01:16.901 --> 01:17.968
Well, I wouldn't know.

01:18.035 --> 01:19.336
I'm a vegetarian.

01:19.404 --> 01:20.838
- Shocker.
- Yeah.

01:20.906 --> 01:22.340
And if you guys knew
how they treated

01:22.407 --> 01:23.775
The animals
that you are eating,

01:23.842 --> 01:25.811
You would eat them even faster

01:25.879 --> 01:27.013
Just to put them
out of their misery

01:27.081 --> 01:28.481
And then you would throw up.

01:29.550 --> 01:30.717
I don't know.

01:30.785 --> 01:33.153
Maybe I'm feeling
extra protective

01:33.221 --> 01:34.587
Of animals today because
my cat is sick.

01:34.655 --> 01:36.423
- Oh, a cat?
- That's awful.

01:36.491 --> 01:37.857
He has diabetes.

01:37.925 --> 01:39.959
He can't even make it
to the litter box--

01:40.026 --> 01:42.193
- Chicken run!
- Whoo!

01:42.261 --> 01:44.329
Ow!

01:44.396 --> 01:47.598
I'm afraid that I'm gonna
have to put her to sleep.

01:49.400 --> 01:50.333
Ah, go on.

01:50.401 --> 01:51.334
God bless you.

01:51.401 --> 01:52.768
Save some for me!

01:52.836 --> 01:54.136
Watch out!

02:02.099 --> 02:05.315
Oh, I can hear those fingers
calling my name.

02:05.382 --> 02:07.117
"Troy!
Troy!"

02:07.184 --> 02:08.852
Troy, did you get
my text message?

02:08.919 --> 02:09.954
"did you get my text message?"

02:10.020 --> 02:14.892
Um, I think it's--

02:14.960 --> 02:16.260
I got to stop hanging out
with her.

02:16.328 --> 02:18.730
She sounds like
a chicken finger.

02:18.797 --> 02:20.197
Again?

02:20.265 --> 02:21.699
Outrageous.

02:21.767 --> 02:23.400
At least apologize.

02:23.468 --> 02:26.669
How can you just stand
there like a mute idiot?

02:29.940 --> 02:32.007
- Ooh.
- Well...

02:32.075 --> 02:33.442
Throat surgery
might humanize you,

02:33.510 --> 02:34.743
But it doesn't
make this acceptable.

02:34.811 --> 02:35.944
So cute.

02:36.012 --> 02:38.613
And I don't even normally
like dreadlocks.

02:38.681 --> 02:42.918
Hello.

02:42.986 --> 02:44.820
His dreadlocks remind me
of the predator,

02:44.888 --> 02:47.658
Which is weird, because
you're doing the actual hunting

02:47.726 --> 02:51.262
And you seem invisible to him.

02:51.330 --> 02:53.064
- Abed, you know what I do?
- Hmm?

02:53.132 --> 02:54.900
Before I talk, I ask myself,

02:54.968 --> 02:56.034
"what am I about to say

02:56.102 --> 02:58.604
And how might it affect
each person listening?"

02:58.672 --> 03:00.372
I'm really glad
you said that, britta.

03:00.440 --> 03:02.408
The idea that you compulsively
filter yourself

03:02.476 --> 03:05.212
Makes your lack of flavor
kind of a flavor.

03:05.279 --> 03:08.348
Sorry, guys.
They ran out again.

03:08.416 --> 03:10.151
Something's gotta be done.

03:13.755 --> 03:15.423
Hey!

03:15.491 --> 03:18.894
What the hell, man?

03:18.961 --> 03:20.929
That's half our problem
right there.

03:20.997 --> 03:23.532
Star-burns works the fryer
and skims fingers.

03:23.600 --> 03:24.734
No way.

03:24.801 --> 03:25.935
He gives them to people just so

03:26.003 --> 03:27.804
They'll act like
he isn't star-burns

03:27.872 --> 03:29.139
Well, I may not eat meat,

03:29.206 --> 03:31.642
But I am not gonna
eat that injustice.

03:31.709 --> 03:32.910
Let's complain.

03:32.978 --> 03:34.645
If we complain,
he gets a warning

03:34.713 --> 03:35.779
And learns to be sneakier.

03:35.847 --> 03:37.248
I say we knock him out
of the kitchen

03:37.315 --> 03:38.983
And replace him with one
of our own

03:39.050 --> 03:40.551
All in one move.

03:40.619 --> 03:42.086
Then we're the ones
with the chicken.

03:42.154 --> 03:43.521
It's like a mafia movie.

03:43.589 --> 03:44.922
As far back as I can remember,

03:44.990 --> 03:46.524
I always wanted to be
in a mafia movie.

03:46.591 --> 03:47.758
Cool.

03:47.826 --> 03:49.393
That's exactly
what it's like, Abed,

03:49.461 --> 03:50.928
And you get the most
important job.

03:50.996 --> 03:52.162
You're gonna be fry cook.

03:52.230 --> 03:53.764
We may be watching
different mafia movies.

03:53.832 --> 03:55.398
You worked in your
dad's restaurant, right?

03:55.466 --> 03:56.632
Well, you'll apply for the job

03:56.700 --> 03:57.800
After we get star-burns fired.

03:57.868 --> 03:58.968
I don't know about that.

03:59.036 --> 04:00.336
I don't know about the firing.

04:00.404 --> 04:02.306
I think he really relies
on that income.

04:02.373 --> 04:03.407
Yeah, man.

04:03.475 --> 04:05.409
Every day you flock here
like sheep

04:05.477 --> 04:08.079
And wait in line for a broken
promise from a dirty system.

04:08.147 --> 04:09.547
Back in those days, Jeff winger

04:09.615 --> 04:10.915
Was the guy that
made things happen.

04:10.983 --> 04:12.384
He always knew what to say

04:12.452 --> 04:14.353
And he always knew when
to slap the table.

04:14.420 --> 04:16.421
You want to be sheep,
keep flocking.

04:16.488 --> 04:18.757
You want to be wolves,
form a pack.

04:18.825 --> 04:21.160
And that was it.
It was that simple.

04:21.226 --> 04:23.595
At that moment,
we stopped being a family

04:23.663 --> 04:26.432
<i>And started being a family...
In italics.</i>

04:26.499 --> 04:28.767
Britta got cozy
with star-burns.

04:28.835 --> 04:30.536
- Can I touch both at--oh!
- Yeah, do 'em both.

04:30.603 --> 04:32.637
He lowered his guard
and just like that,

04:32.705 --> 04:36.975
He was gone.

04:37.043 --> 04:39.544
I mean, the way Jeff saw it,
by not respecting us,

04:39.612 --> 04:41.746
Star-burns had basically brought
it on himself.

04:41.814 --> 04:43.949
And when his job opened up,
we did what we had to do

04:44.016 --> 04:46.985
To keep the list
of applicants to a minimum.

04:47.053 --> 04:48.720
I had worked in my dad's
falafel restaurant,

04:48.788 --> 04:50.355
So I had a pretty
impressive resume.

04:50.423 --> 04:51.456
It's very impressive.

04:51.524 --> 04:53.558
Especially your reference.

04:53.626 --> 04:54.826
Just give 'em a call right now.

04:54.894 --> 04:56.194
But we weren't taking
any chances.

04:56.261 --> 04:58.162
The fix was in.

04:58.230 --> 05:01.332
Trump tower, this is Donald.

05:01.399 --> 05:02.900
Well, he can deep-fry
the hell out of chicken.

05:02.967 --> 05:04.234
I can tell you that.

05:04.302 --> 05:05.702
Troy even applied
for the same job

05:05.770 --> 05:06.903
And gave the world's
worst interview

05:06.971 --> 05:08.938
Just to make me look better

05:09.006 --> 05:10.373
And that was that.

05:10.441 --> 05:12.542
This was the glorious time.

05:12.609 --> 05:14.143
No more racing
to the cafeteria.

05:14.210 --> 05:15.444
No more lines.

05:15.512 --> 05:16.845
To us, lines were for suckers,

05:16.913 --> 05:18.613
Hacks, sheep.

05:18.681 --> 05:20.848
We were wolves.

05:20.916 --> 05:24.552
And we had the chicken
to prove it.

05:24.619 --> 05:26.053
- Oh.
- Ooh.

05:26.120 --> 05:27.454
To victory.

05:27.522 --> 05:29.022
It feels unfamiliar,

05:29.090 --> 05:30.523
But it tastes like chicken.

05:30.591 --> 05:34.060
Mm-hmm.

05:34.127 --> 05:35.461
Hi.

05:35.529 --> 05:37.430
- Hello.
- You guys are lucky.

05:37.498 --> 05:38.464
They're always running out.

05:38.532 --> 05:40.099
Would you like one?

05:40.167 --> 05:43.069
Name's Shirley.
Memorize it.

05:43.137 --> 05:44.570
I will, Shirley.

05:44.638 --> 05:45.571
Eee!

05:45.639 --> 05:46.706
See that, girls?

05:46.774 --> 05:48.908
The universe goes
by supply and demand.

05:48.975 --> 05:51.877
The more you take and use,
the more it sends.

05:51.945 --> 05:53.245
Somebody's been taking
a little extra.

05:53.313 --> 05:54.380
What's in that container?

05:54.448 --> 05:55.448
- Eight fingers.
- Abed.

05:55.515 --> 05:58.617
Abed's study group.

05:58.685 --> 06:00.185
Why are you giving
Chang chicken?

06:00.253 --> 06:01.319
We have an agreement.

06:01.387 --> 06:02.620
But, Abed,
if you get caught skimming,

06:02.688 --> 06:04.889
You get fired and we all go back
to eating like britta.

06:04.957 --> 06:07.224
Yeah, we put you in that job.

06:07.292 --> 06:09.993
I dressed like a crazy pharaoh
for you, man.

06:10.061 --> 06:12.128
You make the fingers, Abed,
not the decisions.

06:12.196 --> 06:13.129
I'm sorry.

06:13.196 --> 06:14.530
It's okay, buddy.

06:14.598 --> 06:16.732
But just remember
these things have power.

06:16.800 --> 06:17.967
So just let me know next time

06:18.034 --> 06:20.436
You have any more agreements,
all right?

06:20.504 --> 06:22.572
Yeah, I agreed to give Cheng
eight fingers per lunch

06:22.640 --> 06:24.574
In exchange for a 10% bump
on every Spanish test

06:24.642 --> 06:25.842
For each of us.

06:25.910 --> 06:28.345
- Oh!
- Okay.

06:28.413 --> 06:29.947
Abed makes the fingers
and the decisions.

06:30.015 --> 06:31.482
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

06:35.054 --> 06:36.855
Oh, Abed, you're like the best.

06:39.527 --> 06:40.527
At greendale, they were always
out of chicken fingers,

06:40.595 --> 06:42.495
So whoever could get
them had power.

06:42.563 --> 06:44.030
Oh.

06:44.098 --> 06:45.164
And I was the guy in the apron,

06:45.232 --> 06:46.666
So I came up with a system
and pretty soon

06:46.734 --> 06:47.834
Half the chicken at greendale

06:47.902 --> 06:50.570
Was going out the side door.

06:50.637 --> 06:52.371
Everybody in our crew
had a job.

06:52.438 --> 06:54.005
T-bone was the bag man.

06:54.073 --> 06:55.607
He'd move the fingers
to a storeroom

06:55.675 --> 06:57.408
Where two of the girls
did the packaging.

06:57.476 --> 06:59.544
We could trust them not
to eat the supply

06:59.612 --> 07:00.879
Because britta was a vegetarian

07:00.946 --> 07:02.580
And Shirley figured
that if she stole,

07:02.648 --> 07:04.482
She'd go to hell.

07:04.549 --> 07:06.383
They'd hand the stuff
out the window to Annie.

07:06.451 --> 07:08.751
She was the leg man
and distributor.

07:08.819 --> 07:12.688
The crazy thing
was it was their food

07:12.755 --> 07:14.823
And we were stealing it and
giving it back to them

07:14.890 --> 07:17.157
Like it was a big favor.

07:17.225 --> 07:19.893
Nobody asked any questions
because Pierce's experience

07:19.961 --> 07:21.460
As a ceo had taught him how

07:21.528 --> 07:23.196
To keep the wheels
from squeaking.

07:23.263 --> 07:24.764
I had it all worked out
on a schedule.

07:24.832 --> 07:26.865
You know, I've never been
fired from a job

07:26.933 --> 07:28.867
And this is, like,
my perfect job.

07:28.934 --> 07:30.434
I'm Mr. Chicken fingers.

07:30.502 --> 07:32.303
The minute before
you thought about busting us,

07:32.371 --> 07:35.072
That was the minute you
had a chicken in your hand.

07:35.140 --> 07:36.840
Everyone had their hand out.

07:36.908 --> 07:39.476
Everyone wanted what we had.
Oh! Oh, well.

07:39.543 --> 07:41.578
So we had anything we wanted.

07:41.645 --> 07:43.345
And Jeff had the most
important job of all.

07:43.413 --> 07:44.546
He was at the top.

07:44.614 --> 07:45.981
He was the boss.

07:46.048 --> 07:47.582
He was our leader.

07:47.650 --> 07:49.484
What the hell is going on?

07:49.551 --> 07:51.319
A-v kids hooked it up.

07:51.386 --> 07:52.687
Abed supplied
the whole department

07:52.754 --> 07:53.753
With chicken fingers.

07:53.821 --> 07:54.920
You think that's good,

07:54.988 --> 07:56.821
Check out my posse
and Troy's monkey.

07:56.889 --> 07:59.456
Troy, why do you have a monkey?

07:59.524 --> 08:01.358
Uh, it's an animal
that looks like a dude.

08:01.426 --> 08:02.926
Why don't I have ten of them?

08:02.994 --> 08:06.596
Guys, look what Abed
scored for me.

08:06.664 --> 08:07.731
Ooh.

08:07.798 --> 08:09.064
It has a million zippers

08:09.132 --> 08:10.365
And it was free.

08:14.370 --> 08:15.837
- Oh.
- Ooh, robot.

08:15.904 --> 08:17.371
I am a robot.

08:17.439 --> 08:19.907
I am programmed
to love this backpack.

08:19.974 --> 08:20.974
This is insane.

08:21.041 --> 08:22.542
More insane
than programming them

08:22.609 --> 08:24.277
To replace auto workers?

08:24.345 --> 08:26.011
What?

08:26.079 --> 08:29.848
Okay, okay, if you're not
in this study group, please.

08:29.915 --> 08:31.115
No, no.

08:31.182 --> 08:32.750
That means you,
sexy dreadlocks,

08:32.817 --> 08:34.284
Britta's hairdresser...
What?

08:34.352 --> 08:36.152
Pierce's hackneyed entourage.

08:36.220 --> 08:37.753
Hackneyed?

08:37.821 --> 08:38.854
You see the turban guy?

08:38.922 --> 08:40.556
Yes, in a '90s ski movie

08:40.624 --> 08:42.725
That featured an entourage.

08:42.792 --> 08:44.426
Don't you guys think this
is getting out of hand?

08:44.494 --> 08:45.627
Oh, we're not gonna get caught.

08:45.695 --> 08:47.195
We have campus security
on the take.

08:47.263 --> 08:48.630
Abed's got it all figured out.

08:48.697 --> 08:50.765
- Mm-hmm.
- Well, that's a relief.

08:50.833 --> 08:52.300
Yeah, it's pretty cool
being friends

08:52.367 --> 08:54.068
With the biggest man on campus.

08:54.136 --> 08:55.370
Isn't that right,
Annie's boobs?

08:56.505 --> 08:58.106
Please rename that thing!

08:58.174 --> 09:00.141
And this time, not with
a contest on Twitter.

09:00.209 --> 09:01.309
It's his Twitter account.

09:01.377 --> 09:02.577
He can do what he wants.

09:02.645 --> 09:03.979
They are my body parts!

09:04.047 --> 09:05.080
I do not consent to this!

09:05.148 --> 09:06.815
You know what
I don't appreciate?

09:10.020 --> 09:11.153
You wouldn't threaten a monkey.

09:11.221 --> 09:14.124
They have more
lactic acid than us.

09:14.191 --> 09:15.858
Shared my chicken with him.

09:15.926 --> 09:16.992
- Talk to the backpack.
- I told you!

09:17.060 --> 09:18.294
You're the worst, Annie.

09:18.362 --> 09:19.762
Streets ahead!

09:27.903 --> 09:29.571
Line starts behind you.

09:29.638 --> 09:31.339
Oh, he's cool.

09:31.407 --> 09:33.607
Six fingers every Wednesday.

09:33.675 --> 09:35.108
Cool.
And what can you offer?

09:35.176 --> 09:38.379
I have a bicycle
and I teach beginner's tennis.

09:38.447 --> 09:39.814
Cool.
Okay.

09:39.881 --> 09:42.016
Six fingers wednesdays.

09:42.083 --> 09:43.917
All right.

09:43.985 --> 09:45.285
We'll be in touch, janel.

09:45.353 --> 09:48.389
- Thank you, Abed.
- You're welcome.

09:48.457 --> 09:50.358
Hey, Jeff.
Hey, buddy.

09:50.426 --> 09:51.860
It's quite a setup
you got here.

09:51.927 --> 09:54.495
I'm pretty excited about it.

09:54.563 --> 09:55.930
It turns out everyone has needs

09:55.997 --> 09:57.898
And everyone has functions.

09:57.966 --> 09:59.933
Look, um, I've been thinking

10:00.001 --> 10:01.802
Maybe I need to hit
the big red button

10:01.869 --> 10:04.471
And bring an end
to this operation.

10:04.539 --> 10:07.674
I mean, it's been fun,
but it's out of control now.

10:07.742 --> 10:09.375
Am I right?
I don't know.

10:09.443 --> 10:11.310
The entire campus
is controlled by our group,

10:11.378 --> 10:12.778
Our group is controlled
by chicken,

10:12.846 --> 10:15.247
And the chicken
is controlled by me.

10:15.315 --> 10:16.282
Float?

10:16.349 --> 10:17.617
I'm good.

10:17.684 --> 10:20.087
Abed, the mafia movie is over.

10:20.154 --> 10:21.722
I'm not doing a mafia movie.

10:21.789 --> 10:23.324
In fact, I don't need
to use movies

10:23.392 --> 10:25.226
Or tv shows to talk
to people anymore.

10:25.294 --> 10:27.128
Before, I only needed them
because the day-to-day world

10:27.196 --> 10:28.730
Made no sense to me, but now,

10:28.798 --> 10:30.231
Everyone's speaking
the same language.

10:30.299 --> 10:31.500
Chicken.

10:31.567 --> 10:33.469
I understand people
and they finally understand me.

10:33.536 --> 10:36.038
Abed, eventually people are
gonna get tired of chicken.

10:36.105 --> 10:37.105
I'm tired of chicken.

10:37.173 --> 10:38.173
You're not tired of chicken.

10:38.241 --> 10:39.474
You miss the taste of control.

10:41.276 --> 10:42.743
Well, that's crazy.

10:42.810 --> 10:45.646
Is it?

10:48.850 --> 10:50.550
Unfortunately, the very thing
that drove you

10:50.618 --> 10:51.985
To this dorm room
is what would prevent you

10:52.052 --> 10:53.453
From properly running
this machine

10:53.520 --> 10:54.654
Or even being a cog in it.

10:54.722 --> 10:55.955
Your ego.

10:56.023 --> 10:58.791
Well...

10:58.859 --> 11:00.560
I see.
I see.

11:00.628 --> 11:04.198
This has been about me
the whole time.

11:04.265 --> 11:07.601
You want a shot
at the Jeff winger throne?

11:07.669 --> 11:10.339
You better bring
a powerful ass.

11:10.407 --> 11:12.941
Oh, and for your information,
I don't have an ego.

11:13.009 --> 11:15.811
My facebook photo
is a landscape.

11:20.918 --> 11:23.820
You're the best, Eduardo.

11:23.888 --> 11:25.288
Thank you all for coming.

11:25.356 --> 11:26.623
Can we make this quick?

11:26.691 --> 11:28.558
I need to give a banana
to Annie's boobs.

11:28.626 --> 11:30.327
Abed is drunk
with chicken power.

11:30.395 --> 11:33.330
He's gone from lovable
Johnny five to evil hal.

11:33.398 --> 11:34.998
- Hal holb--
- not hal holbrook.

11:35.066 --> 11:36.033
What are you saying?

11:36.101 --> 11:38.469
You all have
to stop working for him.

11:38.537 --> 11:40.204
Let this operation dry up

11:40.272 --> 11:42.173
And let his wheels spin down.

11:42.241 --> 11:45.077
At which point you would
be in charge again, right?

11:45.145 --> 11:46.979
- What?
- This is so sad.

11:47.047 --> 11:49.516
You're jealous of Abed because
he's providing for us.

11:49.583 --> 11:50.650
Mm-hmm.

11:50.718 --> 11:52.052
No, I'm concerned about Abed

11:52.120 --> 11:53.454
Because he won't listen
to reason.

11:53.522 --> 11:54.990
<i>Won't listen to your reason.</i>

11:55.058 --> 11:56.091
Mm-hmm.

11:56.159 --> 11:57.893
Why should he?
Jeff's so not...

11:57.960 --> 11:59.828
Say "streets ahead" and die.

11:59.896 --> 12:02.430
Streets ahead.

12:03.666 --> 12:04.699
You want to boss me around?

12:04.767 --> 12:05.700
Get me an entourage.

12:05.767 --> 12:06.900
Get Troy a monkey.

12:06.968 --> 12:08.235
That's what a real boss does.

12:08.303 --> 12:09.503
Yes.

12:09.571 --> 12:10.571
We probably shouldn't
even be talking to him

12:10.638 --> 12:11.571
Without checking with Abed.

12:11.639 --> 12:12.939
I'm already trying him.

12:13.007 --> 12:14.674
He's not picking up.
What did you do with him?

12:14.742 --> 12:16.442
I don't believe
what greedy sellouts

12:16.510 --> 12:18.344
You people turned out to be.

12:18.411 --> 12:19.712
I'm not gonna stand here
and be ignored.

12:19.780 --> 12:21.046
Shh!
Voicemail.

12:21.114 --> 12:22.214
Hey, Abed.

12:22.282 --> 12:23.882
Jeff says you're
not listening to him.

12:23.950 --> 12:25.684
Does that mean we shouldn't
listen to him either?

12:25.752 --> 12:28.119
Oh, also, should
we make special jackets

12:28.187 --> 12:29.721
For our crime family?

12:29.789 --> 12:32.057
Like, blazers with
chicken finger patches.

12:32.124 --> 12:33.892
I don't know.
Long message. I'm sorry.

12:33.959 --> 12:35.226
That's it!

12:35.294 --> 12:36.594
- Ooh!
- Abed!

12:38.163 --> 12:39.963
Look, I'm walking out
this door right now.

12:40.031 --> 12:41.565
- Okay.
- Okay.

12:41.632 --> 12:43.099
- For real.
- Good.

12:43.167 --> 12:45.234
- I'm not gonna look back.
- Mm-hmm.

12:45.302 --> 12:47.136
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye!

12:47.204 --> 12:48.304
Abed!

12:48.372 --> 12:49.739
- Hi!
- Yes!

12:49.807 --> 12:50.907
Anybody need anything?

12:50.975 --> 12:52.742
Oh, everything.
You look handsome.

12:52.810 --> 12:55.478
I like everything
about you now, Abed.

12:55.546 --> 12:57.980
I want a new hairdresser
though.

12:59.000 --> 13:05.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

13:19.548 --> 13:22.117
Yeah, I got you fired.

13:22.184 --> 13:23.618
You deserved it.

13:23.686 --> 13:26.454
Maybe.
Maybe not.

13:26.522 --> 13:30.725
The question is:
What do they deserve?

13:36.333 --> 13:37.666
Key to the kitchen.

13:37.734 --> 13:40.336
There's a valve on the back
of the chicken fryer

13:40.403 --> 13:42.304
That's not made anymore.

13:42.372 --> 13:45.741
Now, say someone were
to remove it.

13:45.809 --> 13:49.212
The fryer wouldn't work...

13:49.279 --> 13:51.013
Forever.

13:51.081 --> 13:54.416
How petty do you think I am?

13:58.154 --> 14:01.122
Jeff leaving the family didn't
turn out to be a problem.

14:01.190 --> 14:03.659
Okay, I think we're set
for the quiz.

14:03.726 --> 14:05.093
- Yep.
- See you guys in class.

14:05.161 --> 14:06.395
Oh, wait.
Before you go.

14:06.463 --> 14:08.331
- Oh, free notebooks.
- Here.

14:08.398 --> 14:11.868
But the family's success started
to go to their heads.

14:11.936 --> 14:13.503
They didn't have college ruled?

14:13.571 --> 14:14.671
No, sorry.

14:14.739 --> 14:16.740
It's okay.

14:21.212 --> 14:23.113
- Abed?
- Yeah?

14:23.181 --> 14:24.314
Can I talk to you for a minute?

14:24.382 --> 14:25.316
Sure.

14:25.383 --> 14:27.084
We have a situation.

14:27.152 --> 14:28.819
- Hey.
- Who is this?

14:28.887 --> 14:30.254
It's Travis.

14:30.322 --> 14:32.122
You said you wanted someone
in your entourage named Travis.

14:32.190 --> 14:35.292
Show him your license.

14:35.359 --> 14:37.027
Travis is his middle name.

14:37.095 --> 14:38.295
I go by Travis.

14:38.363 --> 14:39.596
No, you go by the door.

14:39.664 --> 14:42.466
See you, Travis.

14:42.533 --> 14:46.070
Get it right next time.

14:46.138 --> 14:47.338
- Abed?
- Yep?

14:47.406 --> 14:49.407
No, no, no, no.

14:49.475 --> 14:55.246
My monkey hates this caviar.

14:55.314 --> 14:56.514
Troy, isn't that--

14:56.581 --> 14:59.684
They were spoiled, fat, lazy.

14:59.752 --> 15:01.352
I'd given them everything
and somehow

15:01.420 --> 15:03.321
I'd lost their respect.

15:03.389 --> 15:05.190
So I did the only thing
I could think of.

15:05.257 --> 15:06.991
I did what I thought Jeff
would do.

15:07.059 --> 15:09.561
I sent them a message.

15:20.172 --> 15:21.472
What is that?

15:21.539 --> 15:23.741
I think it might be a backpack

15:23.808 --> 15:26.443
That's been mutilated.

16:04.381 --> 16:06.849
These were the bad times.

16:10.887 --> 16:12.121
- There he is.
- Jeff.

16:12.188 --> 16:13.422
- Jeff!
- Jeff!

16:13.489 --> 16:14.556
- Jeff!
- Jeff!

16:14.624 --> 16:16.057
Abed killed my backpack.

16:16.125 --> 16:17.458
And I caught him
stuffing my man

16:17.526 --> 16:19.393
Full of chicken and Tyler Perry
has a whole series of movies

16:19.460 --> 16:20.627
About why that's wrong.

16:20.695 --> 16:22.496
That little arab
is off his rocker.

16:22.564 --> 16:23.965
He released Annie's boobs.

16:24.032 --> 16:25.366
Annie's boobs could
be anywhere.

16:25.434 --> 16:26.601
Annie's boobs could be
on the side of the road.

16:26.669 --> 16:27.869
We got it.

16:27.937 --> 16:28.937
The monkey's name
is "annie's boobs."

16:29.005 --> 16:31.106
Look what Abed did to my hair.

16:31.174 --> 16:33.609
I feel terrible for all of you.

16:33.677 --> 16:35.745
Wait, no, I don't,
because I warned you

16:35.813 --> 16:37.580
About all this,
but you were so high

16:37.648 --> 16:39.282
On your backpacks
and hairstyles

16:39.349 --> 16:41.350
You accused me
of being jealous.

16:41.418 --> 16:43.152
You were right.
But what can we do?

16:43.220 --> 16:45.955
I'm sorry, you brushed over
that first part.

16:46.023 --> 16:48.591
Together.

16:48.659 --> 16:50.693
You were right.

16:50.761 --> 16:51.994
Now what you can do is go home

16:52.062 --> 16:54.129
And write that
on your bathroom mirror.

16:54.197 --> 16:55.964
Wouldn't that make it seem
like I was right?

16:56.032 --> 16:58.000
Yeah, because it would be
my mirror.

16:58.068 --> 17:00.002
It's not gonna be reversed
because you're the one who--

17:05.375 --> 17:08.277
As for Abed, for his sake

17:08.345 --> 17:10.780
I guess I'll have
to take him out.

17:10.848 --> 17:11.982
Poor little guy.

17:12.050 --> 17:14.218
Oh, good.
That's nice.

17:32.371 --> 17:34.872
Abed.

17:34.940 --> 17:36.207
What are you doing?

17:36.274 --> 17:38.575
Making tater tots.

17:38.643 --> 17:40.844
You were right,
people got sick of chicken.

17:40.912 --> 17:41.879
But I was close.

17:41.947 --> 17:43.548
I just need a new food,
a new system.

17:43.615 --> 17:45.349
I'm gonna experiment
with jalapeno poppers next

17:45.417 --> 17:47.185
And then zucchini zircles.
I don't get it.

17:47.252 --> 17:48.587
It's not that complicated,
Jeff.

17:48.654 --> 17:50.022
They replaced the "c" in circle
with a "z" for zucchini.

17:50.089 --> 17:52.224
No, no, I mean,
why are you here?

17:52.292 --> 17:54.627
You said you were close?

17:57.097 --> 17:59.199
What were you close to?

18:00.968 --> 18:03.937
To the group?

18:04.004 --> 18:05.272
To people?

18:05.339 --> 18:06.939
Please don't do
a special episode about me.

18:07.007 --> 18:08.374
Oh, I wouldn't dream of it.

18:10.510 --> 18:12.777
Everyone else needs my help.

18:12.845 --> 18:14.279
That's what people don't get,

18:14.346 --> 18:18.049
Is that they need to get me.

18:18.117 --> 18:20.084
I just need to be able to
connect to people like you can,

18:20.151 --> 18:21.619
And then I can
make everyone happy

18:21.686 --> 18:24.689
Like you do.

18:26.826 --> 18:28.388
Do you know why I'm here?

18:28.456 --> 18:30.188
You got caught
with a fake bachelor's degree.

18:30.255 --> 18:31.522
By the way,
they started using that

18:31.590 --> 18:32.856
<i>As a seasonal arc on
law & order.</i>

18:32.924 --> 18:34.691
Total rip off.

18:34.759 --> 18:37.727
I'm here to dismantle
the fryer,

18:37.795 --> 18:41.865
To cut your power off
at its source.

18:41.932 --> 18:43.367
Don't you see what happened?

18:43.434 --> 18:44.701
I manipulated the group

18:44.769 --> 18:46.135
Into getting you
the fry cook job

18:46.203 --> 18:48.571
So I could have some chicken.

18:48.639 --> 18:51.741
And you turned it all into
a way to make everyone like you.

18:51.809 --> 18:52.943
Mm-hmm.

18:53.010 --> 18:55.312
Made me ashamed of myself.

18:55.379 --> 18:56.780
Made me jealous.

18:56.848 --> 18:58.448
Maybe this is
a special episode.

18:58.516 --> 19:00.049
It's pretty alarming behavior,
Jeff.

19:00.117 --> 19:01.383
Yeah.

19:01.451 --> 19:02.818
You know, there's specialists
you could talk to.

19:02.886 --> 19:04.286
Yeah, maybe I should do that.

19:04.354 --> 19:05.421
Mm-hmm.

19:05.488 --> 19:06.789
- In the meantime...
- Mm-hmm?

19:06.856 --> 19:07.956
Let's make a deal.

19:08.024 --> 19:10.358
I'll help you
connect with people,

19:10.425 --> 19:12.426
And you help me
do a better job with them.

19:12.494 --> 19:14.161
<i>Like knight rider.</i>

19:14.229 --> 19:15.762
<i>Exactly.
Like knight rider.</i>

19:15.830 --> 19:17.030
Deal.

19:17.098 --> 19:18.198
I'll put on a leather jacket

19:18.265 --> 19:19.499
And make out
with an aerobics instructor.

19:19.567 --> 19:21.000
You pull around front
and comedically

19:21.068 --> 19:23.269
Startle passersby
with your ability to talk.

19:23.337 --> 19:24.771
Maybe we should just stay here

19:24.838 --> 19:26.439
And have a plate
of chicken fingers.

19:26.507 --> 19:28.208
Cool.

19:28.276 --> 19:29.843
Can we eat them
while sitting on a table

19:29.911 --> 19:30.944
<i>Like in sixteen candles?</i>

19:31.012 --> 19:32.445
Pick one reference, Abed.

19:32.513 --> 19:34.181
<i>Sixteen candles.</i>

19:34.248 --> 19:36.951
And just like that,
the mafia movie was over.

19:37.018 --> 19:38.552
I quit the fry cook job,

19:38.620 --> 19:40.654
Somewhat for the sake
of the family,

19:40.722 --> 19:43.390
But mostly for the sake
of Jeff's ego.

19:43.458 --> 19:44.824
Poor guy.

19:44.892 --> 19:46.492
Things went back to normal.

19:46.560 --> 19:49.328
Now everyone's back to being
a bunch of regular schnooks,

19:49.396 --> 19:51.730
And I'm back to being a weirdo,

19:51.798 --> 19:54.333
Back to watching
from the outside...

19:54.400 --> 19:55.834
For now.

19:55.902 --> 19:57.436
There's still
not enough chicken fingers.

19:57.503 --> 20:00.105
- No way.
- What?

20:00.173 --> 20:01.640
'cause as soon
as our family moved out,

20:01.708 --> 20:04.009
A new syndicate moved in
to take its place.

20:04.077 --> 20:06.712
But you know what they'll
never make a replacement for?

20:08.482 --> 20:11.150
Friends.

20:11.218 --> 20:13.687
Okay, thank you.
That's great, Abed.

20:13.755 --> 20:16.156
But could you just
answer the question?

20:16.224 --> 20:17.659
What was it?

20:17.726 --> 20:19.160
Do you know
who might have stolen

20:19.228 --> 20:20.828
A box of hairnets
from the kitchen?

20:20.896 --> 20:22.363
Someone with hair.

20:22.431 --> 20:25.099
I'm gonna write that down.
