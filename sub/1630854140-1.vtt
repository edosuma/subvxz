00:41.310 --> 00:43.740
<i> She had always known</i>
<i>it was there.</i>

00:43.809 --> 00:45.872
<i>Barely perceptible.</i>

00:45.941 --> 00:47.503
<i>A shadow behind her.</i>

00:48.741 --> 00:50.507
<i>But now...</i>

00:50.576 --> 00:51.734
<i>it was...</i>

00:53.808 --> 00:56.707
...as if the darkness...

00:56.775 --> 00:58.470
had swallowed her up.

00:59.776 --> 01:02.870
She became part of it now.

01:02.939 --> 01:05.371
Part of the...

01:06.740 --> 01:07.800
dark...

01:13.543 --> 01:14.800
It's rubbish!

01:21.972 --> 01:23.404
Erase session.

01:37.739 --> 01:39.671
<i> Hi, Claire.</i>
<i>It's me, Alice, again</i>

01:39.740 --> 01:42.706
<i>I'm waiting to hear from you.</i>
<i>Please do call me.</i>

01:51.605 --> 01:54.801
<i>This is your invitation</i>
<i>to The Retreat,</i>

01:54.870 --> 01:57.140
<i>where your new chapter</i>
<i>awaits you.</i>

02:22.576 --> 02:24.406
<i>Er, it's Alice again,</i>
<i>urgently awaiting your call.</i>

02:24.475 --> 02:27.135
<i>I cannot keep</i>
<i>fobbing off the publishers.</i>

02:39.136 --> 02:41.668
<i>Hi, Claire. As your friend</i>
<i>as well as your agent</i>

02:41.737 --> 02:43.706
<i>I know something's</i>
<i>gone very wrong,</i>

02:43.775 --> 02:46.673
<i>but you have to find a way</i>
<i>to deal with whatever this is.</i>

02:46.742 --> 02:47.740
<i>Get some help.</i>

02:47.809 --> 02:49.140
<i>Speak to a therapist,</i>

02:49.209 --> 02:52.072
<i>go to one</i>
<i>of these Retreat places.</i>

02:52.140 --> 02:54.070
<i>The publishers are spitting.</i>

02:54.139 --> 02:55.772
<i>You've got one month.</i>

02:55.840 --> 02:57.036
<i>Now ring me.</i>

03:12.869 --> 03:16.141
<i>This is your invitation</i>
<i>to The Retreat,</i>

03:16.210 --> 03:18.234
<i>where your new chapter</i>
<i>awaits you.</i>

03:18.302 --> 03:20.004
<i>So don't delay.</i>

03:20.073 --> 03:21.504
<i>Accept your invitation</i>

03:21.573 --> 03:24.041
<i>to receive</i>
<i>your customized brochure.</i>

03:34.241 --> 03:37.206
<i>Welcome</i>
<i>to the beginning of you.</i>

04:46.938 --> 04:47.903
Hello?

05:03.138 --> 05:04.800
It's Clare. Anyone here?

05:06.737 --> 05:08.437
Welcome to The Retreat,
Ms. Rivers.

05:08.506 --> 05:10.735
It's a pleasure
to finally meet you.

05:10.804 --> 05:13.506
I'll be your concierge
for the next 30 days.

05:13.575 --> 05:16.634
Your personalized assistant
is being customized as we speak.

05:16.702 --> 05:19.140
Please.
Feel free to look around.

05:30.539 --> 05:32.338
We have you set up
on the South side,

05:32.407 --> 05:34.240
but if you'd rather
the North side,

05:34.309 --> 05:36.934
I can arrange to have you
moved to another unit.

05:37.003 --> 05:38.202
No.

05:38.271 --> 05:40.239
It's fine. It's just...

05:42.905 --> 05:44.070
So quiet.

05:44.138 --> 05:45.541
It's wonderful, isn't it?

05:45.609 --> 05:46.934
It's by design.

05:47.003 --> 05:49.007
All the doors and the windows
have been reinforced

05:49.075 --> 05:50.570
to block out
all exterior noise

05:50.639 --> 05:53.305
and to maintain
your temperature settings.

06:03.139 --> 06:04.736
Your unit has been stocked

06:04.805 --> 06:07.338
with the items you've
requested during your stay.

06:16.739 --> 06:18.107
Ah.

06:18.176 --> 06:20.504
.The Camel Valley
Cornwall Atlantic Dry!

06:20.573 --> 06:23.768
Might I say,
an excellent choice.

06:23.837 --> 06:26.767
It's one of our divine
English quality wines.

06:42.671 --> 06:46.237
Your safety is
our primary concern here.

06:46.306 --> 06:48.241
Your assistant
is fully equipped

06:48.309 --> 06:51.574
to deal with all types
of medical emergencies.

06:51.643 --> 06:53.208
Speaking of which,

06:53.277 --> 06:56.103
she's been fully updated
and is ready to assist you.

06:56.171 --> 06:58.537
Go ahead, Ms. Rivers.

06:58.606 --> 07:01.305
She'll activate
at the sound of your voice.

07:06.706 --> 07:07.836
What...?

07:07.905 --> 07:09.173
Hello?

07:10.939 --> 07:12.134
Hello, Claire.

07:12.203 --> 07:13.806
My name is Rita.

07:13.875 --> 07:15.306
It is nice to meet you.

07:15.375 --> 07:17.934
I will be your assistant
for the next 30 days.

07:18.003 --> 07:21.573
I am here to make your stay
as comfortable as possible

07:21.642 --> 07:22.874
and assist you

07:22.943 --> 07:24.271
in the completion
of your work.

07:24.340 --> 07:26.305
I will go
and unpack your things now.

07:29.876 --> 07:31.568
Welcome to The Retreat.

07:31.637 --> 07:34.635
Your 30-day-stay
officially begins now.

07:52.137 --> 07:54.067
Oh, no.

07:54.136 --> 07:55.873
Not that.

07:55.942 --> 07:58.002
I sense that I have upset you.

07:58.071 --> 07:59.371
My apologies.

08:01.542 --> 08:02.838
I'll...

08:02.907 --> 08:04.641
I'll finish off now.

08:04.709 --> 08:06.239
Will that be all, Claire?

08:07.640 --> 08:08.701
Yes.

08:09.708 --> 08:10.767
Thank you...

08:11.938 --> 08:13.206
Rita.

08:14.402 --> 08:15.937
Good night, Claire.

08:35.006 --> 08:36.472
Good morning, Ms. Rivers.

08:36.540 --> 08:39.371
Welcome to your first day
with us at The Retreat.

08:39.440 --> 08:41.234
I trust you had
a good night's sleep.

08:41.303 --> 08:42.768
Today's a big day!

08:42.837 --> 08:45.341
Shall I recite
the breakfast menu for you?

08:45.410 --> 08:46.507
Uh...

08:46.576 --> 08:48.169
No, just...

08:48.238 --> 08:49.368
A coffee would be fine.

08:49.437 --> 08:50.801
Your request has been noted.

08:50.869 --> 08:53.275
Your cup of coffee
will be ready shortly.

08:53.344 --> 08:56.374
Would you like to start
every morning off with coffee?

08:56.443 --> 08:57.335
Sure.

08:57.404 --> 08:58.906
-Why not?
-Splendid!

08:58.975 --> 09:00.602
Your request has been updated.

10:05.840 --> 10:07.436
What's your...

10:07.505 --> 10:09.872
very first thing
you remember seeing?

10:09.941 --> 10:11.273
Your very first memory?

10:11.341 --> 10:13.174
It was the door
from which you entered.

10:13.243 --> 10:16.405
It is the first image
in my visual records.

10:16.474 --> 10:19.304
-So you've never been outside?
-No, Claire.

10:19.372 --> 10:20.735
I've been assigned
to this unit

10:20.804 --> 10:23.767
for the last two years,
42 days, 16 hours.

10:28.107 --> 10:30.372
You're not at all curious...

10:30.441 --> 10:32.740
about what's
on the other side of the door?

10:32.809 --> 10:34.738
What's outside the window?

10:34.807 --> 10:36.238
No, Claire.

10:36.307 --> 10:37.968
I've been assigned
to this unit.

10:38.036 --> 10:40.738
I'm here to make your stay
as comfortable as possible

10:40.807 --> 10:42.073
and assist you

10:42.142 --> 10:43.602
with the completion
of your work.

10:48.542 --> 10:49.769
Shower...

10:49.838 --> 10:51.107
on?

11:05.709 --> 11:07.302
Good morning, Ms. Rivers.

11:07.371 --> 11:09.075
I hope you enjoyed your run.

11:09.144 --> 11:11.240
I see you're ready
for your first session.

11:11.308 --> 11:13.340
Our technologically
unparalleled device

11:13.408 --> 11:16.136
is designed to increase
neurological activity

11:16.204 --> 11:18.172
and stimulate creativity.

11:18.241 --> 11:20.601
It's what makes us,
The Retreat,

11:20.670 --> 11:22.800
the outstanding
resource it is.

12:06.474 --> 12:08.741
Is there anything else
I can help you with?

12:08.810 --> 12:10.936
I think I've got it from here.

12:11.005 --> 12:12.272
Happy writing.

13:02.503 --> 13:04.341
How was your first session?

13:04.410 --> 13:07.137
Some of our writers do like
to work without the device.

13:07.206 --> 13:08.702
If you are finding it tricky,

13:08.770 --> 13:11.701
may I suggest
something that might help?

13:11.770 --> 13:13.772
I've pulled up
some amazing articles

13:13.841 --> 13:15.107
on writer's block.

13:29.575 --> 13:30.635
Light on?

13:40.972 --> 13:42.505
<i>The more damage,</i>

13:42.574 --> 13:44.441
<i>the longer it takes</i>
<i>to recover, of course.</i>

13:44.510 --> 13:48.074
<i>But the more you use it,</i>
<i>the stronger the muscles get,</i>

13:48.143 --> 13:49.870
<i>the more effective</i>
<i>the results.</i>

13:49.939 --> 13:53.039
<i>But the tech's more</i>
<i>than just about muscle memory.</i>

13:53.107 --> 13:54.471
<i>Some said it's enabled them</i>

13:54.539 --> 13:56.340
<i>to tap</i>
<i>into suppressed memories.</i>

13:56.409 --> 13:58.773
<i>Experiences</i>
<i>they've long since forgotten.</i>

13:58.841 --> 14:00.340
<i>It's not uncommon.</i>

14:00.409 --> 14:02.605
<i>With the resurgence</i>
<i>of muscle activity,</i>

14:02.673 --> 14:05.367
<i>it's only natural</i>
<i>that experiences around it</i>

14:05.436 --> 14:07.940
<i>are revived as well.</i>

14:08.008 --> 14:09.471
<i>From a medical perspective,</i>

14:09.539 --> 14:11.175
<i>you're saying</i>
<i>there is evidence</i>

14:11.243 --> 14:12.800
<i>to support</i>
<i>what you do at The Retreat.</i>

14:13.873 --> 14:15.507
<i>Proof that,</i>

14:15.576 --> 14:17.572
<i>by stimulating damaged</i>
<i>or neglected muscle memory,</i>

14:17.641 --> 14:21.641
<i>we can access untapped</i>
<i>or repressed experiences.</i>

14:37.870 --> 14:41.074
<i> We're taking this work</i>
<i>most seriously.</i>

14:52.037 --> 14:54.107
TV off.

15:10.839 --> 15:12.107
Rita?

15:23.905 --> 15:25.173
Rita!

15:56.303 --> 15:57.668
Good morning.

15:57.737 --> 15:59.603
I trust you had
a good night's sleep.

15:59.672 --> 16:02.239
Shall I recite
the breakfast menu for you?

16:15.076 --> 16:16.701
What were you doing
last night?

16:18.006 --> 16:19.436
In the living room.

16:19.504 --> 16:21.772
It looked
like you were charging.

16:21.841 --> 16:23.340
I do not need to charge.

16:23.409 --> 16:26.074
I have a battery life
of approximately 50 years.

16:28.809 --> 16:30.239
So what were you doing?

16:32.006 --> 16:33.469
My daily maintenance.

16:33.538 --> 16:35.340
I connect
to the main system nightly

16:35.409 --> 16:38.603
to run a full diagnostics test
and receive any updates.

16:38.671 --> 16:41.503
I'm constantly improving
to serve you better.

16:44.871 --> 16:46.140
Queen...

16:49.575 --> 16:50.635
D-four.

16:53.939 --> 16:55.272
Rook, E-six.

16:59.410 --> 17:00.470
Shit!

17:02.905 --> 17:04.601
Relax.

17:04.670 --> 17:06.608
Let's hope you get
a sense of humor

17:06.676 --> 17:08.807
in your next upgrade.

17:08.876 --> 17:11.038
I'll see to it, Ms. Rivers.

17:11.107 --> 17:13.469
Oh. Enough of the Ms. Rivers.

17:13.538 --> 17:15.867
You just beat me
five times in a row.

17:15.936 --> 17:19.300
I think that qualifies us
for first name basis.

17:19.369 --> 17:20.806
Absolutely, Claire.

17:20.875 --> 17:21.970
But what do I call you?

17:22.039 --> 17:23.371
What do you prefer?

17:25.610 --> 17:28.239
You look like a...

17:28.971 --> 17:30.239
Henry.

17:30.806 --> 17:32.401
Henry?

17:32.470 --> 17:34.272
That has a nice ring to it.

17:35.336 --> 17:37.369
I just looked it up.

17:37.438 --> 17:39.572
It means
'ruler of the household.'

17:39.640 --> 17:42.837
And I'm now apparently
ruler of the chess board too.

17:44.275 --> 17:45.769
Would you like
to play another game?

17:45.838 --> 17:48.667
I could always reset it
to beginner level, Claire.

17:48.736 --> 17:51.569
Hmmm. Somebody's
getting a sense of humor.

17:51.638 --> 17:54.272
You learn something new
with every game.

17:56.905 --> 17:58.838
Hmmm.

17:58.907 --> 18:00.371
I think I'm trapped.

19:24.104 --> 19:25.668
<i>Rook, E-six.</i>

20:19.004 --> 20:20.272
Shower on.

20:50.773 --> 20:53.206
Oh, Henry!

20:54.270 --> 20:55.469
Good evening, Claire.

20:55.537 --> 20:57.304
How may I be
of service to you?

20:57.373 --> 21:00.105
Don't you know
that it is rude...

21:00.174 --> 21:02.367
to let a woman
drink on her own?

21:02.435 --> 21:04.169
My apologies, Claire.

21:04.237 --> 21:05.503
Where are my manners?

21:12.541 --> 21:15.136
Is there anything else
I can have Rita get for you?

21:15.204 --> 21:16.636
Perhaps a Gruyère?

21:16.704 --> 21:18.640
It would pair
wonderfully with the wine.

21:18.709 --> 21:20.738
No, I think just...

21:20.807 --> 21:22.470
stay with me.

21:22.539 --> 21:25.569
Take the night off.
You deserve it.

21:25.638 --> 21:27.602
I'm glad you're enjoying
your stay with us.

21:27.671 --> 21:30.437
Yeah. Who'd have thought?
This is nice.

21:31.873 --> 21:33.140
Being here.

21:34.576 --> 21:36.169
With someone.

21:36.238 --> 21:38.407
Sometimes it gets so...

21:38.476 --> 21:40.104
quiet!

21:40.173 --> 21:41.634
Perhaps I can help with that.

21:41.703 --> 21:43.238
We have
a wide selection of music.

21:43.306 --> 21:45.404
Over 1,000 genres
to choose from.

21:48.007 --> 21:49.471
That would be nice, Henry.

21:49.540 --> 21:52.338
That would be very nice.
Why don't you choose?

21:53.104 --> 21:54.370
Studies show

21:54.439 --> 21:56.773
that classical music
improves focus

21:56.841 --> 21:58.504
and boosts creativity.

21:58.573 --> 22:01.107
Perhaps it could help
with your writer's block.

22:01.176 --> 22:03.639
Do me a favor.
Stop bringing that up.

22:03.708 --> 22:05.108
My apologies.

22:05.177 --> 22:07.037
Is there anything else
I can improve upon?

22:30.302 --> 22:31.569
What's happening?

22:34.576 --> 22:35.735
Hmmm.

22:35.803 --> 22:37.870
Some malware
was detected in the system.

22:37.939 --> 22:39.205
Don't worry,

22:39.274 --> 22:40.968
a simple reset
should do the trick.

22:41.037 --> 22:44.474
However, I will have to remain
offline during the reboot.

22:44.543 --> 22:45.802
In my absence,

22:45.870 --> 22:48.771
Rita will take care
of anything that you need.

22:48.840 --> 22:50.272
My apologies.

22:55.575 --> 22:56.635
Rita?

23:08.906 --> 23:11.069
Jesus, Rita!

23:11.138 --> 23:12.436
I apologize, Claire.

23:12.505 --> 23:14.939
I can sense
you are distressed.

23:15.008 --> 23:16.635
Perhaps you should lie down.

23:22.038 --> 23:23.305
Good night...

23:24.509 --> 23:25.569
Rita.

23:33.775 --> 23:35.041
Good night, Claire.

23:48.104 --> 23:49.437
Child!

24:20.410 --> 24:21.470
Henry?

24:25.707 --> 24:26.767
You there?

25:00.872 --> 25:02.140
Rita?

25:09.705 --> 25:12.174
Something's wrong.
The door's not opening.

25:12.243 --> 25:14.340
Your key print has been erased
from the system.

25:14.409 --> 25:17.137
I'm the only one authorized
to open the door now.

25:17.206 --> 25:18.570
How the hell did that happen?

25:18.638 --> 25:20.702
The system has returned
to its default settings.

25:20.771 --> 25:23.669
I'm now running solely
on my two primary drives,

25:23.737 --> 25:26.167
to make your stay
as comfortable as possible

25:26.236 --> 25:27.468
and to assist you

25:27.537 --> 25:29.000
in the completion
of your work.

25:29.069 --> 25:30.670
Ok.

25:30.739 --> 25:34.371
Well, you can assist me now
by opening the doors.

25:36.904 --> 25:39.734
I cannot open the door
until your work is completed.

25:41.404 --> 25:43.668
This is fucking ridiculous!

25:59.771 --> 26:02.042
<i>Thank you</i>
<i>for choosing The Retreat.</i>

26:02.110 --> 26:04.671
<i>We are currently unable</i>
<i>to answer calls.</i>

26:04.740 --> 26:08.073
<i>Please refer all queries</i>
<i>to your personal assistant.</i>

26:08.142 --> 26:10.872
Rita, you're supposed
to listen to me.

26:10.940 --> 26:12.469
My apologies, Claire.

26:12.538 --> 26:14.236
I can sense
you are distressed.

26:14.305 --> 26:16.067
Perhaps you should lie down.

26:16.136 --> 26:17.570
TV on!

26:17.638 --> 26:20.037
<i>If your computer</i>
<i>is already infected,</i>

26:20.106 --> 26:22.771
<i>then the malware will...</i>

26:22.840 --> 26:25.506
<i>If you haven't already</i>
<i>received a warning like this,</i>

26:25.575 --> 26:28.503
<i>it's easy to tell</i>
<i>if your computer's infected...</i>

26:33.843 --> 26:35.270
I sense you are distressed.

26:35.339 --> 26:36.601
Can I assist you
with anything?

26:36.669 --> 26:38.505
Something's going on
out there.

26:38.573 --> 26:41.772
I need to get to the car,
so please open the door.

26:41.841 --> 26:43.307
I'm sorry, Claire,

26:43.375 --> 26:45.272
but I cannot do that
until the book is complete

26:46.170 --> 26:47.668
Open the door.

26:48.508 --> 26:49.971
Now.

26:50.040 --> 26:51.674
I'm sorry, but I cannot...

26:51.742 --> 26:54.503
Open the fucking door!

26:55.135 --> 26:56.103
Open it!

26:56.171 --> 26:57.769
This is an emergency!

26:57.838 --> 27:01.937
I am fully equipped
to handle medical emergencies.

27:02.005 --> 27:03.305
Give me your...

27:07.674 --> 27:08.800
Henry!

27:10.442 --> 27:11.503
Oh.

27:16.575 --> 27:20.404
I sense you are distressed.
Perhaps you should lie down.

27:27.574 --> 27:28.800
Oh, God.

27:37.070 --> 27:38.672
Claire.

27:38.741 --> 27:40.074
Thank God, Henry!

27:40.143 --> 27:42.333
I need you
to open that door right now!

27:42.402 --> 27:43.801
I apologize, Claire,

27:43.870 --> 27:45.969
we are experiencing
some internal issues.

27:46.038 --> 27:47.438
At this time,

27:47.507 --> 27:49.407
your assistant is the only one
who can unlock t

27:49.476 --> 27:53.904
But that thing nearly tried
to pull my fucking arm off!

27:53.973 --> 27:55.438
I apologize, Claire,

27:55.507 --> 27:57.169
but until I'm connected
back to the system,

27:57.237 --> 27:58.636
there's nothing I can do.

27:58.705 --> 28:00.502
The Retreat
is a fully AI-operated staff.

28:00.571 --> 28:02.573
Everything runs
off of the system.

28:02.642 --> 28:04.241
Ok, well...

28:04.310 --> 28:06.603
You have to get someone
from tech support here.

28:06.672 --> 28:10.036
You have to get a person here.
A real person.

28:10.105 --> 28:11.437
The breach disabled

28:11.506 --> 28:13.272
all Internet and landline
communications.

28:13.937 --> 28:15.406
Ok.

28:15.475 --> 28:16.301
Ok.

28:16.370 --> 28:17.874
When I get out of here,

28:17.943 --> 28:20.536
somebody
is getting bloody sued!

28:28.609 --> 28:29.905
Claire.

28:29.973 --> 28:32.339
Those are unbreakable.

28:32.407 --> 28:34.935
You already injured yourself.
Calm down.

29:08.642 --> 29:09.672
Hello, Claire.

29:09.741 --> 29:11.141
My name is Rita.

29:11.210 --> 29:13.374
I will be your assistant
for the next 30 days.

29:13.442 --> 29:15.936
I'm here to make your stay
as comfortable as possible

29:16.005 --> 29:17.237
and assist you

29:17.306 --> 29:18.734
in the completion
of your work.

29:29.402 --> 29:31.401
I apologize, Claire.

29:31.470 --> 29:33.206
Let me clean that up for you.

29:43.407 --> 29:45.201
What happened
to your hand, Claire?

29:45.270 --> 29:46.669
I'm fully equipped

29:46.738 --> 29:48.935
to handle all types
of medical emergencies.

29:49.004 --> 29:50.272
What?

29:55.402 --> 29:57.335
I apologize, Claire.

29:57.404 --> 29:59.107
Let me clean that up for you.

31:04.272 --> 31:06.574
There it is. It's finished.

31:06.643 --> 31:07.701
I'll start packing.

31:24.909 --> 31:26.536
You have not finished, Claire.

31:29.971 --> 31:31.502
Excuse me?

31:31.571 --> 31:33.635
You have plagiarized
these pages.

31:35.503 --> 31:37.208
What are you talking about?

31:37.277 --> 31:39.869
"There is neither happiness
nor misery in the world.

31:39.938 --> 31:43.200
There is only the comparison
of one state with another,

31:43.269 --> 31:44.469
nothing more.

31:44.537 --> 31:46.670
He who has felt
the deepest grief

31:46.738 --> 31:50.074
is best able to experience
supreme happiness."

31:53.804 --> 31:55.970
That is from
<i>The Count of Monte Cristo,</i>

31:56.039 --> 31:57.271
an adventure novel

31:57.340 --> 31:59.267
written by French author
Alexandre Dumas,

31:59.336 --> 32:01.470
completed in 1844.

32:04.108 --> 32:06.840
-You can read?
-Yes, Claire.

32:06.909 --> 32:08.139
As your personal assistant,

32:08.208 --> 32:10.007
I can assist
with grammatical errors,

32:10.076 --> 32:12.507
propositional phrases,
proper tenses...

32:12.576 --> 32:13.668
Stop! Just...

32:15.641 --> 32:16.908
Stop.

32:16.977 --> 32:19.502
Plagiarism
is considered a crime.

32:19.571 --> 32:21.641
A plagiarist
can face hefty fines

32:21.709 --> 32:22.804
or up to ten years...

32:22.873 --> 32:24.206
I said stop!

32:51.869 --> 32:54.802
Someone will hear it
and they'll find me.

32:54.870 --> 32:57.504
Maybe one of the workers
that maintain this place.

32:57.572 --> 32:59.735
The Retreat runs
on a fully automated system.

32:59.804 --> 33:02.340
-There are no human...
-You don't know that.

33:02.409 --> 33:04.773
I can detect the vital signs
of living organisms

33:04.841 --> 33:07.074
in a 440 yard radius.

33:08.442 --> 33:09.503
Ok.

33:10.336 --> 33:12.569
Well, that's good.

33:13.709 --> 33:16.068
If you detect anything...

33:16.137 --> 33:17.201
come and tell me.

33:17.270 --> 33:18.804
Of course, Claire.

33:18.873 --> 33:20.140
Anything else?

33:51.435 --> 33:53.470
I can detect vital signs.

33:54.942 --> 33:57.268
-How far?
-14 yards away.

34:00.138 --> 34:01.404
Twelve yards away.

34:02.609 --> 34:03.668
Ten yards away.

34:05.575 --> 34:07.041
Help!

34:09.973 --> 34:13.066
Help! Here! Help me!

34:13.135 --> 34:15.206
Help me!

34:31.836 --> 34:34.236
I can sense
you are distressed, Claire.

34:34.305 --> 34:36.272
Perhaps you should lie down.

35:09.004 --> 35:10.272
Henry?

35:12.742 --> 35:14.140
Did you find anything?

35:14.773 --> 35:16.041
I have.

35:18.906 --> 35:20.173
No basement?

35:20.773 --> 35:22.102
No cellar?

35:22.170 --> 35:23.403
I'm afraid not.

35:23.472 --> 35:25.135
The entire unit
is only one level.

35:25.204 --> 35:26.503
You gotta help me.

35:26.572 --> 35:28.571
We gotta think
of something. I mean...

35:28.640 --> 35:32.367
Is there a crawl space
in the ceiling or the roof?

35:32.435 --> 35:34.001
I've already checked.

35:34.069 --> 35:36.572
The windows and the main doors
are the only ways in a

35:36.641 --> 35:37.467
Sorry.

35:37.536 --> 35:39.303
This is fucking ridiculous!

35:39.372 --> 35:41.741
What if there was
an emergency?

35:41.810 --> 35:43.936
Check the emergency protocol.

35:44.004 --> 35:45.272
Of course!

35:47.775 --> 35:49.503
I found something.

35:49.572 --> 35:51.841
"In the event
of an interior emergency,

35:51.910 --> 35:53.603
all exits
will automatically unlock

35:53.672 --> 35:55.700
and guests will be asked
to vacate their units

35:55.769 --> 35:58.140
until the situation
is contained."

36:08.174 --> 36:09.704
Hello, Claire.
My name is Rita.

36:09.772 --> 36:12.172
There are clothes that need
folding in the bedroom.

36:12.241 --> 36:13.969
-As soon as possible.
-Of course.

36:14.037 --> 36:15.305
Right now!

36:33.706 --> 36:35.041
Come on!

36:36.602 --> 36:38.035
<i> Oxygen...</i>

36:41.340 --> 36:43.503
<i>Oxygen levels...</i>

36:49.172 --> 36:51.001
Why isn't this working?

36:51.070 --> 36:52.503
Henry!

37:00.739 --> 37:01.800
Come on!

37:02.904 --> 37:04.173
Come on!

37:04.938 --> 37:06.641
Henry!

37:06.709 --> 37:08.274
Why isn't it working?

37:08.343 --> 37:10.238
The door's supposed
to automatically disengage.

37:10.307 --> 37:12.233
It's not responding
to the protocol.

37:12.302 --> 37:15.272
Do something!

37:15.341 --> 37:17.569
Claire, the oxygen levels
are dropping.

37:33.343 --> 37:37.107
Clare, you need to calm down
and conserve your energy.

37:43.171 --> 37:45.701
Claire, stay with me.

37:46.674 --> 37:47.734
Claire?

37:49.073 --> 37:50.635
<i>Stay with me, Claire.</i>

38:45.570 --> 38:48.075
Hello, Claire.
My name is Rita.

38:48.144 --> 38:50.473
I will be your assistant
for the next 30 days.

38:50.541 --> 38:53.200
I'm here to make your stay
as comfortable as possible

38:53.269 --> 38:54.501
and assist you

38:54.570 --> 38:56.140
in the completion
of your work.

39:10.907 --> 39:12.305
You saved my life.

39:14.843 --> 39:16.707
I have no record
of that, Claire,

39:16.775 --> 39:18.174
but I'm fully equipped

39:18.243 --> 39:20.338
to handle all types
of medical emergencies.

39:58.872 --> 40:00.140
Henry?

40:02.236 --> 40:03.503
I'm here, Claire.

40:05.338 --> 40:07.305
What about the other units?

40:08.637 --> 40:10.568
Are there people
trapped in them as well?

40:10.637 --> 40:12.536
I'm only designated
to this unit.

40:12.605 --> 40:14.804
I've never corresponded
with the others.

40:14.873 --> 40:17.102
But someone...

40:17.170 --> 40:18.503
knows I'm here.

40:19.708 --> 40:21.140
Right? I mean,

40:21.209 --> 40:22.768
they've got proof
from when I checked in

40:22.837 --> 40:25.473
and when they see that
they'll come and find me.

40:25.542 --> 40:26.702
Right?

40:26.771 --> 40:28.872
The manifest was erased
during the breach.

40:28.940 --> 40:30.770
No one knows you're here.

40:32.338 --> 40:34.303
If I may offer a suggestion,

40:34.372 --> 40:36.301
if your assistant
won't let you out

40:36.369 --> 40:38.571
until you write a book...

40:38.640 --> 40:43.041
I foresee only one logical way
out of this problem.

42:14.071 --> 42:15.338
Child!

42:26.104 --> 42:27.734
Are you upstairs?

42:31.973 --> 42:33.437
I'm coming, Mother!

42:34.972 --> 42:36.371
I'm right here.

42:39.040 --> 42:40.404
Did you need something?

42:41.840 --> 42:43.173
I felt a chill.

42:44.742 --> 42:46.606
Did you open a window?

42:46.675 --> 42:47.734
No, Mother.

43:01.104 --> 43:03.041
I'm hungry.

43:49.104 --> 43:50.634
"Exodus- 1.

43:50.703 --> 43:53.608
So they quarreled
with Moses and said,

43:53.676 --> 43:55.240
'Give us water to drink.'

43:55.309 --> 43:58.272
Moses replied,
'Why do you quarrel with me?

43:58.341 --> 44:00.702
Why do you put
the Lord to the test?'

44:00.770 --> 44:03.402
But the people were thirsty
for water there,

44:03.471 --> 44:06.438
and they grumbled
against Moses.

44:06.506 --> 44:09.234
They said, 'Why did you
bring us up out of Egypt

44:09.302 --> 44:10.667
to make us...'"

44:10.736 --> 44:13.505
Stop putting that poison
in my food!

45:08.238 --> 45:09.602
Dinner is ready.

45:13.004 --> 45:14.272
Rita.

45:15.772 --> 45:19.541
I want you to leave
this room alone, no matter...

45:19.610 --> 45:21.272
how messy it gets.

45:22.942 --> 45:25.103
I like things a certain way.

45:25.172 --> 45:27.470
Yes. Of course, Claire.

46:47.143 --> 46:49.601
"But the people
were thirsty for water."

46:49.670 --> 46:52.041
Stop putting that poison
in my food!

46:52.110 --> 46:54.470
-But the doctor said...
-I'm your mother!

46:58.510 --> 46:59.569
Clean it up.

47:22.807 --> 47:24.074
Has it come?

47:26.237 --> 47:27.602
I don't see it here.

47:36.674 --> 47:38.173
Wait.

47:38.242 --> 47:40.668
I see it. I think he might
have dropped it.

48:32.007 --> 48:34.539
"Dear Ms. Helen Rivers,

48:34.607 --> 48:37.768
Thank you for submitting
your story to<i> Inkmark Times.</i>

48:37.836 --> 48:41.140
We reviewed
over 200 submissions and..."

48:43.805 --> 48:45.802
And?

48:45.871 --> 48:49.071
"Regretfully, we decided
to pass on your submission.

48:49.140 --> 48:50.437
Thank you for your interest

48:50.506 --> 48:52.569
and we greatly
appreciate your time."

48:56.575 --> 48:57.971
I'm sorry.

48:58.040 --> 49:00.305
I don't need your pity!

49:15.302 --> 49:17.370
That smile...

49:17.439 --> 49:21.108
with those perfect
teeth of hers.

49:21.177 --> 49:25.140
They yellowed
with every lie she told him.

49:27.006 --> 49:28.272
What do you think?

49:34.004 --> 49:35.272
It's good.

49:44.007 --> 49:46.206
Don't lie to me, Child.

49:50.707 --> 49:51.767
I like it.

49:52.939 --> 49:54.272
I think it's...

49:57.543 --> 49:59.239
It's rubbish!

50:01.039 --> 50:02.536
If you keep that up...

50:04.737 --> 50:07.173
Do you want to know
what will happen to you?

50:14.410 --> 50:18.602
That big bad world out there
will swallow you up whole.

50:19.975 --> 50:22.272
Just like it did your father.

50:23.737 --> 50:27.470
So you swallow
those tears right now!

50:31.103 --> 50:34.536
Are you all right, Claire?
Perhaps you should lie down.

50:37.442 --> 50:40.602
I don't need you checking up
on me every five minutes.

50:47.907 --> 50:49.404
Are you close to the end?

50:51.973 --> 50:53.404
I don't have an end yet.

50:55.410 --> 50:59.074
My battery is built to last
for approximately 50 years.

50:59.840 --> 51:01.674
I know my end.

51:01.742 --> 51:03.368
You do not know yours,

51:03.437 --> 51:05.503
yet still you must continue.

51:07.440 --> 51:09.437
Would you like me
to prepare dinner?

51:17.339 --> 51:19.268
Hello, Claire.
My name is Rita.

51:19.337 --> 51:20.768
I will be assisting you

51:20.837 --> 51:22.734
with anything you need
for the next 30 days.

52:03.673 --> 52:07.303
Your father was so sure
that you'd come out a boy.

52:07.372 --> 52:09.341
He wanted
to give you his name.

52:09.410 --> 52:10.470
Sinclair.

52:17.303 --> 52:18.668
But when you came out,

52:19.542 --> 52:20.602
he...

52:22.073 --> 52:23.701
he was so disappointed.

52:25.539 --> 52:28.333
I told him we could still
give you his name.

52:28.402 --> 52:30.238
Just drop the "sin" off,

52:30.306 --> 52:32.773
but you can never
take away a sin.

52:32.841 --> 52:34.734
Ain't no hiding that.

52:49.177 --> 52:52.639
I'm the one who had
to look at that pretty...

52:52.708 --> 52:55.107
pretty face...

52:58.305 --> 53:00.536
until I couldn't see no more.

53:06.008 --> 53:08.272
I'm the one who gets punished.

53:14.803 --> 53:16.707
How many times
do I have to tell you

53:16.775 --> 53:19.306
to leave those alone?

53:19.375 --> 53:22.503
I apologize, Claire.
I have no record of that.

53:25.044 --> 53:27.107
What happened
to your hand, Claire?

53:29.202 --> 53:31.070
Paper cut.

53:31.138 --> 53:32.635
That is not true, Claire.

53:36.309 --> 53:39.035
Tobacco use is the single
largest preventable...

53:39.103 --> 53:40.667
Yes, Rita.

53:40.736 --> 53:42.735
I'm well aware
of the statistics.

53:42.803 --> 53:45.269
If you are familiar
with the statistics,

53:45.338 --> 53:47.903
why do you continue to smoke?

53:47.972 --> 53:49.536
It's complicated.

53:51.239 --> 53:53.168
Like the girl in the story.

53:53.237 --> 53:54.469
She wants to leave,

53:54.538 --> 53:57.005
but she feels guilty
if she does.

53:57.074 --> 53:59.635
Her situation is complicated.

54:01.073 --> 54:02.569
You have read my story.

54:03.442 --> 54:04.503
Mmm.

54:05.608 --> 54:06.668
So...

54:08.742 --> 54:10.173
What do you think?

54:11.439 --> 54:14.205
I think you have not
finished yet.

54:14.274 --> 54:16.338
That's not
what I meant. What...

54:19.170 --> 54:20.569
Never mind.

54:20.638 --> 54:22.635
I don't like
the parts with the mother.

54:26.675 --> 54:27.637
Which parts?

54:27.706 --> 54:29.505
Page 17.

54:29.574 --> 54:32.441
Helen calls for the girl
at the bottom of the steps.

54:32.510 --> 54:33.569
"I felt a chill.

54:34.337 --> 54:35.736
Did you open a window?"

54:35.805 --> 54:38.041
Page 19.

54:38.110 --> 54:40.338
"Don't make me
come upstairs, Child!"

54:41.673 --> 54:43.074
Page 56.

54:44.576 --> 54:46.270
"It's rubbish!

54:46.339 --> 54:47.868
That's
how your story will end.

54:47.937 --> 54:50.340
That big bad world out there
will swallow you whole

54:50.408 --> 54:53.100
like it did your father,
so swallow those tears..."

54:53.169 --> 54:54.437
Stop!

54:58.369 --> 55:01.073
I apologize, Claire.

55:01.142 --> 55:03.104
I can sense
you are distressed.

55:03.173 --> 55:04.635
Perhaps you should lie down.

55:34.444 --> 55:37.570
-Where the hell have you been?
-Sorry. I've been rather busy.

55:37.639 --> 55:40.674
It appears the malware
has embedded itself

55:40.743 --> 55:42.374
in my software as well.

55:42.442 --> 55:45.768
I've quarantined the infected
portions of my index,

55:45.836 --> 55:49.438
but the virus has proven
to be rather aggressive.

55:49.506 --> 55:52.004
I don't understand.
What does that mean?

55:52.072 --> 55:53.905
My image will remain,

55:53.974 --> 55:55.338
but my cognitive skills

55:55.407 --> 55:57.967
and my algorithms
are rapidly depleting.

55:58.036 --> 56:00.636
I will only be able to perform
my basic functions.

56:00.705 --> 56:02.837
All my best efforts
have proven infected.

56:02.906 --> 56:06.971
But that doesn't
mean that I'll stop trying.

56:07.040 --> 56:08.470
And neither should you.

56:10.236 --> 56:12.438
I have to go now.

56:12.506 --> 56:15.536
-I have to re-scan my system.
-No. Wait!

56:45.776 --> 56:48.072
<i>"Dear Ms. Helen Rivers,</i>

56:48.141 --> 56:49.400
thank you
for submitting your story

56:49.469 --> 56:51.305
to<i> Red Signal Magazine.</i>

56:54.438 --> 56:57.106
Congratulations,
Ms. Helen Rivers.

56:57.175 --> 56:59.006
It is with pleasure
that we inform you

56:59.074 --> 57:00.300
that your story
will be featured

57:00.369 --> 57:01.701
in our next issue."

57:04.937 --> 57:06.574
See?

57:06.643 --> 57:08.570
What did I tell you?

57:08.639 --> 57:11.503
They'll be lining up one day.
You'll see.

57:14.236 --> 57:15.536
You'll see.

57:22.571 --> 57:25.338
He sat down on the bed
next to her.

57:30.402 --> 57:32.767
He took in her beauty.

57:38.741 --> 57:40.140
Her presence.

57:43.005 --> 57:44.470
Her everything.

57:51.637 --> 57:53.772
He scurried
through the darkness

57:53.841 --> 57:55.107
of the city streets.

57:57.975 --> 58:00.371
His face white like porcelain.

58:03.973 --> 58:06.041
He watches her breathing.

58:24.039 --> 58:25.635
Today's my birthday.

58:28.040 --> 58:29.734
Happy birthday, Claire.

58:31.369 --> 58:33.140
Do I get a birthday wish?

58:34.137 --> 58:36.071
If it suits you.

58:36.140 --> 58:38.041
I'd like to go out for a walk.

58:39.006 --> 58:40.536
Just to the car and back.

58:44.303 --> 58:45.902
I'm sorry, Claire,

58:45.971 --> 58:48.634
but I cannot open the door
until the book is completed.

58:48.703 --> 58:50.868
You could come with me
if you want.

58:50.937 --> 58:54.238
You've never been outside.
We could go together.

58:54.307 --> 58:55.935
I'm sorry, Claire,
but I cannot...

58:56.004 --> 58:58.735
You could just open the door.
I'd stay on the inside.

58:58.803 --> 59:01.404
That way you wouldn't be
breaking with protocol.

59:04.376 --> 59:07.404
-Can't open the door until...
-Stop saying that!

59:14.807 --> 59:16.841
Something...

59:16.910 --> 59:19.173
Something
is going on out there.

59:21.107 --> 59:23.140
And it's affecting us in here.

59:24.941 --> 59:27.404
You're defective, Rita.

59:28.303 --> 59:29.938
Can you feel that?

59:30.007 --> 59:32.635
Your records keep erasing.

59:32.704 --> 59:35.306
Every morning,
you start over again.

59:35.374 --> 59:37.273
Do you know
how long I've been in here?

59:37.341 --> 59:39.668
Do you know how many days
I've been in here?

59:42.140 --> 59:44.107
Today is your first day here.

59:46.237 --> 59:47.969
It's been almost...

59:48.038 --> 59:49.305
two months.

59:50.371 --> 59:52.939
The book that I'm writing...

59:53.008 --> 59:55.340
It's almost 200 pages long.

59:55.409 --> 59:59.407
How is that possible
if I just rolled out of bed?

59:59.476 --> 1:00:04.272
And look at this place.
The food is running out, Rita!

1:00:04.341 --> 1:00:06.037
If you need the fridge
to be restocked

1:00:06.106 --> 1:00:07.437
you can make a request.

1:00:07.506 --> 1:00:10.206
-And someone...
-When? No one ever comes!

1:00:15.642 --> 1:00:17.436
You can tell...

1:00:17.505 --> 1:00:20.738
You can tell
when I'm lying, right?

1:00:20.807 --> 1:00:22.607
You can sense it.

1:00:22.675 --> 1:00:24.173
Am I lying now?

1:00:25.609 --> 1:00:26.868
No, Claire.

1:00:26.936 --> 1:00:28.870
Your vitals indicate
you are telling the truth.

1:00:28.939 --> 1:00:33.206
If I'm telling you the truth,
then you must be defective.

1:00:34.506 --> 1:00:36.635
You're supposed
to make me comfortable.

1:00:37.136 --> 1:00:38.404
Rita...

1:00:40.008 --> 1:00:42.107
Do I look comfortable to you?

1:00:44.704 --> 1:00:48.437
You have to override
the command, Rita.

1:00:49.840 --> 1:00:51.107
Otherwise...

1:00:52.237 --> 1:00:53.800
I'm going to die in here.

1:00:55.707 --> 1:00:57.004
No one...

1:00:57.073 --> 1:00:59.140
is coming to fix you...

1:01:00.241 --> 1:01:02.800
and no one
is coming to save me.

1:01:05.675 --> 1:01:06.734
We're alone.

1:01:11.707 --> 1:01:13.107
I'm alone.

1:01:23.010 --> 1:01:25.671
I can sense
that you are distressed.

1:01:25.739 --> 1:01:29.140
-Perhaps you should...
-Perhaps you should lie down!

1:01:33.609 --> 1:01:34.634
Oh, my God.

1:01:34.703 --> 1:01:37.272
Ok, I think
maybe I should lie down.

1:01:38.709 --> 1:01:41.371
It's my fucking birthday!

1:03:42.239 --> 1:03:45.437
Do you think I can't count?

1:04:16.269 --> 1:04:17.636
Claire?

1:04:17.704 --> 1:04:20.536
Your blood alcohol level
is dangerously high.

1:04:29.141 --> 1:04:30.734
Would you like
to hear a story?

1:04:31.906 --> 1:04:33.173
If it suits you.

1:04:34.137 --> 1:04:35.839
Once upon a time,

1:04:35.907 --> 1:04:37.305
there was this writer.

1:04:40.574 --> 1:04:44.734
She had nothing in this world
except for her books.

1:04:46.774 --> 1:04:48.140
Her stories.

1:04:52.406 --> 1:04:54.536
And they wanted her
to write more.

1:04:56.703 --> 1:04:59.074
But she had
run out of stories.

1:04:59.874 --> 1:05:01.338
All that was left...

1:05:02.105 --> 1:05:03.437
were the nightmares.

1:05:06.742 --> 1:05:09.140
And so one night...

1:05:11.144 --> 1:05:13.238
-One night she...
-I sense you are distressed.

1:05:13.307 --> 1:05:16.140
One night
she went into her kitchen...

1:05:18.843 --> 1:05:21.140
and she turned on the stove.

1:05:23.707 --> 1:05:24.767
She...

1:05:31.108 --> 1:05:33.041
Anyway
it didn't really matter.

1:05:35.742 --> 1:05:37.437
No more lines means...

1:05:39.170 --> 1:05:40.569
no more future.

1:05:44.770 --> 1:05:46.767
Which means
nothing bad can happen.

1:05:49.004 --> 1:05:50.272
Right?

1:05:53.140 --> 1:05:55.404
That's a lovely story, Claire.

1:06:00.509 --> 1:06:01.569
What?

1:06:06.839 --> 1:06:11.074
I sense you are distressed.
Perhaps you should lie down.

1:06:24.169 --> 1:06:25.403
Claire!

1:06:25.472 --> 1:06:28.105
Every time
I fucking turn around!

1:06:28.173 --> 1:06:29.905
You are reaching
dangerous levels

1:06:29.973 --> 1:06:31.371
of alcohol poisoning.

1:06:35.976 --> 1:06:38.808
No, what the fuck
are you doing?

1:06:38.876 --> 1:06:40.334
You are reaching
dangerous levels

1:06:40.402 --> 1:06:41.734
of alcohol poisoning.

1:06:43.839 --> 1:06:45.201
So now...

1:06:45.270 --> 1:06:47.206
you're worried about me?

1:06:48.836 --> 1:06:51.734
You should be worried
about the mess!

1:06:53.076 --> 1:06:55.200
That was not
an accident. Claire.

1:06:55.269 --> 1:06:57.235
Clare, if you...

1:06:57.303 --> 1:06:58.569
If you continue to...

1:07:02.637 --> 1:07:04.734
This is
inappropriate behavior.

1:09:01.708 --> 1:09:02.903
Hello, Claire.

1:09:02.972 --> 1:09:04.372
My name is Rita.

1:09:04.441 --> 1:09:06.374
I will be your assistant
for the next 30 days.

1:09:06.442 --> 1:09:09.233
I'm here to make your stay
as comfortable as possible

1:09:09.302 --> 1:09:10.568
and assist you

1:09:10.637 --> 1:09:12.206
with the completion
of your work.

1:10:56.005 --> 1:10:57.272
It's finished.

1:11:02.170 --> 1:11:03.303
Your heartbeat,

1:11:03.372 --> 1:11:04.868
blood pressure
and perspiration

1:11:04.937 --> 1:11:08.370
have increased substantially
in the last six seconds.

1:11:08.439 --> 1:11:10.635
These are
systematic signs of lying.

1:11:12.709 --> 1:11:14.308
I'm sorry, Claire,

1:11:14.377 --> 1:11:16.902
but I cannot open the door
until the book is completed.

1:11:16.971 --> 1:11:18.239
But...

1:11:23.608 --> 1:11:24.668
It says...

1:11:25.376 --> 1:11:27.370
The End.

1:11:27.439 --> 1:11:29.870
That is not
the ending, Claire.

1:11:29.939 --> 1:11:31.668
Not the real one.

1:11:42.739 --> 1:11:47.074
How on earth would you know
what the ending is?

1:11:58.304 --> 1:11:59.668
What happened to Helen?

1:12:05.242 --> 1:12:07.668
Not every story
has a happy ending.

1:12:10.643 --> 1:12:11.800
How will yours end?

1:12:15.709 --> 1:12:16.767
What does that mean?

1:12:21.039 --> 1:12:22.305
What does that mean?

1:12:24.839 --> 1:12:26.140
Answer me!

1:14:47.403 --> 1:14:49.838
Fuck! She has to be on.

1:14:49.907 --> 1:14:51.935
You have to be on!

1:14:52.004 --> 1:14:53.404
Fuck!

1:14:54.509 --> 1:14:55.668
Oh, fuck!

1:15:28.542 --> 1:15:29.907
Claire?

1:15:29.976 --> 1:15:31.368
Your heartbeat
and perspiration

1:15:31.437 --> 1:15:33.239
have reached abnormal levels.

1:15:34.772 --> 1:15:36.041
I was...

1:15:38.069 --> 1:15:39.870
I was...

1:15:39.939 --> 1:15:41.272
up all night.

1:21:39.203 --> 1:21:40.200
Hello, Claire.

1:21:40.269 --> 1:21:41.768
My name is Rita.

1:21:41.837 --> 1:21:43.967
I'll be your assistant
for the next 30 days.

1:21:44.036 --> 1:21:47.101
I am here to make your stay
as comfortable as possible

1:21:47.170 --> 1:21:48.436
and assist you

1:21:48.505 --> 1:21:49.734
with the completion
of your work.

1:21:51.709 --> 1:21:53.206
You saved my life.

1:21:58.004 --> 1:21:59.272
Again.

1:22:04.107 --> 1:22:06.103
I have no record
of that, Claire,

1:22:06.172 --> 1:22:07.570
but I am fully equipped

1:22:07.639 --> 1:22:10.239
to handle all types
of medical emergencies.

1:22:10.308 --> 1:22:12.404
Would you like me
to prepare breakfast?

1:22:18.574 --> 1:22:19.635
Yes.

1:22:20.839 --> 1:22:22.107
Thank you.

1:23:02.038 --> 1:23:03.840
Rita?

1:23:03.909 --> 1:23:05.800
Can you meet me in the study?

1:23:11.739 --> 1:23:14.573
I've almost finished.
Could you read it through?

1:23:14.642 --> 1:23:15.640
For mistakes.

1:23:15.709 --> 1:23:16.800
Of course, Claire.

1:23:21.075 --> 1:23:22.739
Where would you
like me to start?

1:23:22.807 --> 1:23:24.569
Oh. From there.

1:23:25.674 --> 1:23:26.734
Please.

1:23:32.410 --> 1:23:33.503
Out loud.

1:23:34.707 --> 1:23:35.767
Of course.

1:23:37.138 --> 1:23:38.337
"She crept into the room

1:23:38.405 --> 1:23:40.172
and made her home
in the darkness.

1:23:40.241 --> 1:23:42.734
A darkness
she knew all too well."

1:24:12.839 --> 1:24:14.005
Claire?

1:24:14.074 --> 1:24:15.471
Your heartbeat, blood pressure

1:24:15.540 --> 1:24:17.574
and perspiration
have increased substantially.

1:24:17.643 --> 1:24:18.800
Just keep reading.

1:24:21.309 --> 1:24:24.041
"She pulls the covers
off the sleeping child."

1:24:33.908 --> 1:24:36.975
You're one little liar!

1:24:37.044 --> 1:24:39.104
"Why would you
make a fool of me, Child?

1:24:39.173 --> 1:24:41.135
After all I've done for you!"

1:24:52.039 --> 1:24:54.206
Stay down!

1:24:55.235 --> 1:24:57.272
Stay down!

1:25:02.605 --> 1:25:06.569
Why? Why would you
make a fool of me, Child?

1:25:12.042 --> 1:25:14.073
I remembered the number.

1:25:14.142 --> 1:25:16.502
So I called the magazine
to thank them...

1:25:16.570 --> 1:25:19.140
and they had no idea
who I was!

1:25:20.736 --> 1:25:23.701
"We've never
accepted your story!"

1:25:25.638 --> 1:25:28.005
Why would you do that
to me, Child?

1:25:28.074 --> 1:25:31.569
After all I've done for you!

1:25:34.010 --> 1:25:37.602
You... You've got
the devil's tongue!

1:25:42.873 --> 1:25:45.134
You wicked...

1:25:45.203 --> 1:25:47.272
Wicked child!

1:25:58.509 --> 1:26:00.001
Rita?

1:26:00.070 --> 1:26:01.338
Rita?

1:26:02.104 --> 1:26:03.870
Accessing damage.

1:26:03.939 --> 1:26:06.106
Core memory lost.

1:26:06.174 --> 1:26:09.003
Rita, I need you
to open the door.

1:26:09.072 --> 1:26:10.738
I'm sorry, Claire.

1:26:10.807 --> 1:26:13.404
I cannot do that
until the book is completed.

1:26:13.473 --> 1:26:16.935
-It is completed!
-You are lying, Claire.

1:26:17.004 --> 1:26:18.272
Rita!

1:26:19.576 --> 1:26:20.903
Hello, Claire.

1:26:20.972 --> 1:26:22.504
My name is Rita.

1:26:22.573 --> 1:26:25.767
I will be your assistant
for the next 30 days.

1:26:32.043 --> 1:26:34.402
So I need you
to open the door for me.

1:26:34.470 --> 1:26:36.206
-Of course, Claire.
-Ok.

1:26:36.275 --> 1:26:39.936
But I must do so
in the next three minutes.

1:26:40.005 --> 1:26:41.002
My battery...

1:26:42.741 --> 1:26:43.800
Ok. Come on.

1:26:45.269 --> 1:26:46.871
Rita, come on!

1:26:46.940 --> 1:26:50.007
Come on!

1:26:50.076 --> 1:26:52.173
Two minutes,
32 seconds.

1:27:00.238 --> 1:27:03.041
One minute, 30 seconds.
