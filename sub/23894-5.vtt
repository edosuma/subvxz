WEBVTT

00:07.567 --> 00:09.769
Pablo?!

00:09.869 --> 00:11.371
I didn't know you
were a biter.

00:11.471 --> 00:12.972
That is Pablo out there.

00:13.072 --> 00:14.440
I don't want to kill him.

00:14.540 --> 00:16.041
I want to help him.

00:16.140 --> 00:18.243
Ow!

00:18.344 --> 00:19.579
Kelly.

00:21.381 --> 00:23.082
Give me a kiss.

00:23.182 --> 00:25.250
I'm going to track down
this so-called Ms. Prevett,

00:25.351 --> 00:26.752
deal with Ruby
once and for all.

00:26.852 --> 00:28.654
Ruby?!

00:29.755 --> 00:31.090
Ooh!

00:33.325 --> 00:35.094
It's stuck.
I can't get it off.

00:37.262 --> 00:38.864
Ahh! Foreign person,
easy, relax.

00:38.964 --> 00:40.866
I've dealt with kids
like this before.

00:48.474 --> 00:50.410
Jag sa ju att barnet

00:50.510 --> 00:51.777
var ett Djavul!

00:51.877 --> 00:54.279
Yeah, lady.
I don't speak French.

00:58.117 --> 00:59.585
You likey?
Mmm.

00:59.685 --> 01:01.320
Come on over here,
little kid.

01:01.421 --> 01:03.489
I got something over here
you'll like even better.

01:03.589 --> 01:05.691
See that?
That's a candy dispenser.

01:05.791 --> 01:06.859
Yeah.

01:07.927 --> 01:10.129
Look inside the tiny black
holes and pick one.

01:10.229 --> 01:14.266
Uh... hang that
on the tray...

01:16.636 --> 01:18.638
What is up with
that kid's hand?

01:22.675 --> 01:24.810
Wait a second.

01:24.910 --> 01:26.579
Holy hacksaw,
that's a little me!

01:26.679 --> 01:28.581
Child is yours?
Yeah.

01:28.681 --> 01:30.950
Well, it's not like I had sex
with Ruby, but look at it!

01:31.050 --> 01:33.218
Look at the eyes. And the chin.
And that little saw.

01:33.318 --> 01:35.154
What is that dastardly
Ruby up to now?

01:38.223 --> 01:39.925
Shoot it!
No!

01:40.025 --> 01:42.394
She's going to use that little
shit to screw me somehow.

01:42.495 --> 01:44.296
Well, guess what?
I'll show her.

01:44.396 --> 01:47.266
Nobody screws Ashley J. Williams
like Ashley J...

01:47.366 --> 01:49.268
That sounded so much
better in my head.

01:51.136 --> 01:52.572
Shoot!
Ugh!

01:54.574 --> 01:56.542
Hey!
Don't do that!

01:56.642 --> 01:58.243
I want this kid alive.
No!

01:58.343 --> 02:00.379
Come here,
you little shit!

02:04.450 --> 02:05.685
Run!

02:09.154 --> 02:10.455
Help!

02:16.295 --> 02:18.263
Whoa!

02:18.363 --> 02:19.765
Oh crap. Oh!

02:24.369 --> 02:26.639
Here I come!

02:28.173 --> 02:29.374
Whoa!

02:29.475 --> 02:30.976
Okay listen,
Ricola.

02:31.076 --> 02:33.212
We got to catch that kid.

02:33.312 --> 02:34.446
Because if we
catch that kid,

02:34.547 --> 02:36.081
then my daughter
will know the truth,

02:36.181 --> 02:37.249
which is I'm not
just some psycho

02:37.349 --> 02:38.383
running around
with a chainsaw.

02:38.484 --> 02:39.952
What you talk about?

02:40.052 --> 02:41.353
I just want to get that
kid out of the house,

02:41.453 --> 02:43.689
and into my car.
Oh, please.

02:43.789 --> 02:45.157
Go now.

02:45.257 --> 02:46.959
Relax. That little runt
can't get through this...

02:48.000 --> 02:54.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:58.037 --> 02:59.539
We got to fall back!

02:59.639 --> 03:02.174
Come on!

03:02.274 --> 03:04.510
I'm coming!

03:07.112 --> 03:08.714
Hey, give me that.
What are you doing?

03:08.814 --> 03:11.016
Hey!

03:11.116 --> 03:14.053
You keep your hands off
of my Boomstick.

03:14.153 --> 03:15.487
You got that?!

03:27.533 --> 03:28.768
Oh no.

03:30.770 --> 03:32.037
Uh-oh.

03:35.340 --> 03:37.577
Run!

03:37.677 --> 03:39.411
Oh, where are we?

03:39.511 --> 03:42.314
Oh God... oh, oh!
Run!

03:44.216 --> 03:45.250
Hurry!

03:48.788 --> 03:50.155
What the hell
are we doing...?

03:50.255 --> 03:51.824
Stang munnen,
du dum man!

04:11.611 --> 04:14.279
That little shit is taunting me.

04:14.379 --> 04:16.115
He doesn't know
who he's up against.

04:22.221 --> 04:23.388
Here you go.

04:23.488 --> 04:25.157
We'll tie him up
with this.

04:27.492 --> 04:28.861
Yah.

04:32.497 --> 04:33.866
The craziest part
about this,

04:33.966 --> 04:35.534
it probably won't be
the most fucked up thing

04:35.635 --> 04:36.802
that ever happens to me.

04:36.902 --> 04:39.639
Hey, imagine where else
I could have bitten you.

04:39.739 --> 04:41.473
Don't make me
get my leg wax.

04:44.777 --> 04:48.447
Open up, Kelly, I'm still
hungry for your meat!

04:49.749 --> 04:52.317
Pablo, I do not
want to hurt you!

04:52.417 --> 04:56.121
You think you can save me
when even El Brujo couldn't?

04:56.221 --> 04:57.623
Brujo?

04:57.723 --> 04:59.358
It's Pablo's uncle,
but...

05:00.660 --> 05:04.063
But he's dead,
because of me!

05:06.699 --> 05:08.701
Even from the grave,
that pendejo

05:08.801 --> 05:11.603
thinks he can save
his little Pablito.

05:11.704 --> 05:13.605
Save him?

05:13.706 --> 05:16.075
What the fuck, Kelly?
What do we do?

05:16.175 --> 05:17.710
We just... we stick
to the plan, okay?

05:17.810 --> 05:20.646
We keep defending ourselves
without killing Pablo.

05:22.614 --> 05:24.616
How about a ride on
the Pablo 'stache, Kelly?

05:24.717 --> 05:26.285
You're not tall enough.

05:26.385 --> 05:28.087
Ow!

05:28.187 --> 05:30.656
I bit my tongue! Bitch!
Mother... fuck...!

05:34.426 --> 05:35.695
He's on the roof.

05:35.795 --> 05:38.698
Uh-oh,
you caught us!

05:44.870 --> 05:46.538
Got you!

05:46.638 --> 05:48.640
Brandy!

05:50.642 --> 05:52.477
Hold on, Brandy!
Don't let go!

05:53.746 --> 05:54.847
Hate to crash
the party!

05:54.947 --> 05:56.682
Let her the fuck go!

06:06.959 --> 06:08.327
Oh!

06:08.427 --> 06:09.795
Hold on!

06:17.937 --> 06:19.905
Ah!

06:24.309 --> 06:26.545
You're next... to die!

06:26.645 --> 06:27.813
You're next to die!

06:27.913 --> 06:29.949
You're next to die!

06:34.720 --> 06:37.122
Shut the fuck up!
You're next to die!

06:37.222 --> 06:39.424
Choke on this.

06:49.368 --> 06:51.403
They're connected.

06:51.503 --> 06:52.805
I warned you!

07:01.480 --> 07:03.382
Ah!

07:08.720 --> 07:10.289
Hot tamale!

07:18.798 --> 07:20.032
Brandy, run!

07:23.035 --> 07:25.771
I know you like it
rough, baby.

07:27.406 --> 07:28.573
Stop!

07:28.673 --> 07:30.509
Brandy! Don't!
You'll kill him!

07:52.898 --> 07:54.066
Pablo?

07:55.968 --> 07:58.537
Pablo?

07:58.637 --> 08:00.239
Hey. Hey.

08:00.339 --> 08:02.741
I'm sorry. I didn't
know what else to do.

08:02.842 --> 08:05.310
Pablo? Pablo,
I'm right here.

08:05.410 --> 08:08.380
Pablo, Pablo.

08:08.480 --> 08:10.449
Pablo?

08:20.659 --> 08:22.394
Cuídate.

08:22.494 --> 08:23.896
Fuck.

08:23.996 --> 08:26.065
Am I dead again?

08:26.165 --> 08:29.568
You have brought the
Kandarian Dagger. Huh!

08:29.668 --> 08:31.036
You again.

08:31.136 --> 08:32.938
What do you want?
Who are you?

08:33.038 --> 08:34.539
Her name is Maritsa.

08:35.674 --> 08:36.942
Brujo?

08:39.578 --> 08:41.679
You made it,
Pablito.

08:41.780 --> 08:45.350
But your journey...
is far from over.

08:47.052 --> 08:49.121
Come on.

08:50.689 --> 08:51.891
What...?

08:51.991 --> 08:54.459
What?
What's happening to him?

08:54.559 --> 08:56.361
I don't know.
I don't know.

08:56.461 --> 08:57.930
Pablo?

09:23.022 --> 09:24.756
Please,
we-we go.

09:24.856 --> 09:26.491
Yeah, in a Branson
minute, sweetie.

09:26.591 --> 09:29.895
Let's see what else the lioness
has in her evil den.

09:29.995 --> 09:32.431
First things first.

09:55.420 --> 09:58.723
That writing looks
awfully familiar.

10:06.966 --> 10:09.068
The hell is going on
around here?

10:19.644 --> 10:20.912
Is you?

10:21.713 --> 10:23.915
WTF.

10:24.016 --> 10:25.484
I got that off
my teenage daughter.

10:25.584 --> 10:29.054
Yeah, this is me and Candy
on our wedding night.

10:31.223 --> 10:34.960
Making a daughter
in the back of the Delta.

10:35.060 --> 10:37.096
Working at
Value Stop,

10:37.196 --> 10:38.663
hanging in
my trailer,

10:38.763 --> 10:40.532
holy CIA.

10:40.632 --> 10:43.135
Ruby's been surveilling
my ass for decades.

10:43.235 --> 10:45.037
She could have killed me
any time, anywhere.

10:45.137 --> 10:47.572
You know this,

10:47.672 --> 10:49.141
evil woman,
Ruby?

10:49.241 --> 10:52.844
Yeah.
Here I come!

11:13.598 --> 11:15.034
El tío? What is this place?

11:15.134 --> 11:16.568
Where are we?

11:16.668 --> 11:18.037
Is a void
between realms

11:18.137 --> 11:20.605
that I have managed
to mask from evil,

11:20.705 --> 11:21.973
for now.

11:22.941 --> 11:26.878
I could've sent a leopard,
or a cobra,

11:26.978 --> 11:28.580
but I needed
your attention.

11:30.915 --> 11:33.552
Her death mask is
powerful, isn't it?

11:40.925 --> 11:42.194
There's little time.

11:42.294 --> 11:45.597
Your body's dying
in the earthly plane.

11:45.697 --> 11:47.999
The evil within
is consuming your soul.

11:48.100 --> 11:50.169
And only with
the strength of a Brujo,

11:50.269 --> 11:54.839
you can harness
its power, to aid...

11:54.939 --> 11:57.142
the Prophesied One.

11:57.242 --> 11:58.743
Ash.

12:06.718 --> 12:09.020
Oh, no.

13:00.172 --> 13:02.607
Oh!

13:06.111 --> 13:08.980
Oh. Ow!

13:09.080 --> 13:13.084
Oh, that no good,
double-crossing...

13:36.975 --> 13:38.343
Oh, Heidi!

13:40.145 --> 13:42.714
Why'd you have
to run off like that?

13:48.287 --> 13:51.089
Oh, hey there,
little guy.

13:51.190 --> 13:53.292
There you are.

13:53.392 --> 13:55.227
Why don't you
come on out?

13:55.327 --> 13:56.928
I'm not going
to hurt you.

13:57.028 --> 13:58.263
No, hardly at all.

13:59.998 --> 14:02.501
Yeah, hey,
uh... see?

14:02.601 --> 14:03.835
Look.

14:04.169 --> 14:05.237
Nothing in my hands.

14:05.337 --> 14:07.105
Come on out.

14:07.206 --> 14:09.140
We should play... ow!

14:09.241 --> 14:10.642
F-U.

14:10.742 --> 14:13.011
Ooh, you little son...!

14:15.046 --> 14:18.116
Okay, time to put
baby to bed.

14:18.217 --> 14:20.385
When you turned away from
your ancestors Pablito,

14:20.485 --> 14:22.921
you left yourself
vulnerable to evil.

14:23.021 --> 14:25.123
Now you must prove
yourself worthy,

14:25.224 --> 14:28.026
before you can exert control
over this darkness.

14:28.126 --> 14:30.762
Um, yeah. How bad
is this going to get?

14:30.862 --> 14:34.299
Do you remember the ritual
legends I used to tell you?

14:34.399 --> 14:36.968
Two basins full of blood
of darkness...

14:37.068 --> 14:38.770
And one holds the blood
of our people.

14:38.870 --> 14:41.740
You have to mix your own blood
with the correct bowl.

14:43.242 --> 14:46.245
You choose darkness,
then evil will consume you.

14:46.345 --> 14:49.113
Choose wisely,
and...

14:49.214 --> 14:50.749
I'll become a Brujo,
like you.

14:50.849 --> 14:52.351
Even stronger.

14:52.451 --> 14:54.686
You will accomplish
what none have before.

14:54.786 --> 14:56.921
You will have span
between two realms.

14:57.021 --> 14:59.991
One foot in the Underworld,
the other on the earthly plane.

15:00.091 --> 15:02.126
You, Pablo,
will become...

15:02.227 --> 15:04.929
El Brujo Especial.

15:05.029 --> 15:06.765
Wait, isn't that
the name of a beer?

15:07.866 --> 15:09.401
Are you ready, Pablito?

15:12.337 --> 15:14.172
Buena, buena medicina.

15:14.273 --> 15:15.840
Buena, buena
luz divina.

15:28.119 --> 15:30.689
I'm ready to become
what I was born to be.

15:32.257 --> 15:36.795
Choose the darkness,
or choose the light.

15:36.895 --> 15:39.864
Choose the darkness...
Let's conquer evil.

15:39.964 --> 15:41.866
Good.
Or choose the light.

15:41.966 --> 15:44.369
Now for
the hard part.

15:44.469 --> 15:45.970
Here kiddie,
kiddie.

15:47.972 --> 15:51.242
Come on out,
widdle buddy!

15:54.313 --> 15:57.015
Hey!

15:57.115 --> 15:59.351
Oh! That was
a cheap shot!

15:59.451 --> 16:01.052
Yah, yah!

16:08.993 --> 16:11.930
Oh, you are way too young
to be going up there!

16:17.101 --> 16:19.070
Oh, want to play
hide and seek, huh?

16:19.170 --> 16:20.472
Okay.

16:20.572 --> 16:23.875
I'll close my eyes,
and I'll count to ten.

16:23.975 --> 16:28.146
One, two, three...

16:28.246 --> 16:29.348
eight, nine, ten!

16:35.086 --> 16:37.188
Whoa!

16:39.324 --> 16:41.326
Oh.

16:43.495 --> 16:45.364
Well, there's something you
don't see every day.

16:52.337 --> 16:53.938
Be strong,
Pablito.

16:57.008 --> 16:59.611
Oh shit! Pablo?

17:08.520 --> 17:11.222
Release the beast.

17:11.321 --> 17:15.159
Suelten la bestia.

17:21.265 --> 17:25.069
Suelten la bestia.

17:27.571 --> 17:29.374
He's tearing apart!
He's dying!

17:30.609 --> 17:33.077
Give my Pablo back,
you fucks!

17:37.582 --> 17:39.518
Oh, inside voice!

17:41.152 --> 17:43.422
Yah!
Oh! Watch it, buster!

17:43.522 --> 17:44.989
Yah! Yah!
Oh!

17:45.089 --> 17:46.257
Don't push it,
Tiny Tim.

17:46.357 --> 17:48.159
Yah!
Oh!

17:51.463 --> 17:54.165
Whoa!

17:54.265 --> 17:56.501
Whoa!

17:56.601 --> 17:58.637
Oh, shit! Huh!

18:02.340 --> 18:03.575
Oh, want some,
huh?

18:03.675 --> 18:05.143
Yeah?
Here we go!

18:07.178 --> 18:08.212
Oh, yeah?
Uh-oh.

18:08.312 --> 18:09.914
Oh!

18:10.014 --> 18:11.115
Oh, you're a tricky
little bastard, aren't you?

18:11.215 --> 18:12.484
Hey!

18:13.184 --> 18:14.553
Yah!

18:16.455 --> 18:19.591
Oh, that is so wrong
in so many ways.

18:33.271 --> 18:35.139
Why you little... oh!
No!

18:51.355 --> 18:54.058
Ah!

19:00.298 --> 19:01.566
Whew.

19:03.635 --> 19:04.969
Try and get out
of this.

19:07.706 --> 19:10.108
Mama!

19:20.785 --> 19:23.054
Both evil and your
ancestors are calling.

19:24.355 --> 19:26.324
See them, and choose.

19:34.599 --> 19:36.367
There is no way to know.

19:36.467 --> 19:38.670
Don't see with
your eyes, Pablito.

19:41.540 --> 19:43.241
Don't see with
your eyes.

19:44.843 --> 19:46.110
Brujo?!

19:50.549 --> 19:53.217
Brujo?! Brujo?!

20:05.296 --> 20:07.198
Don't see with
your eyes...

20:09.500 --> 20:11.603
Don't see...
with your eyes...

20:17.275 --> 20:19.377
Hey! Hey!
Fight it!

20:19.477 --> 20:20.745
Pablo, it's okay.
Come on.

20:44.769 --> 20:46.270
Pablo, you got this.

20:46.370 --> 20:48.973
I got this!

20:57.381 --> 20:59.450
Cuídate.

21:14.666 --> 21:17.301
Mi nombre es
Pablo Simon Bolivar.

21:17.401 --> 21:18.703
Y yo soy...

21:18.803 --> 21:21.806
¡El Brujo Especial!

21:31.549 --> 21:32.751
Pablo?

21:36.888 --> 21:38.623
Is he dead?

21:40.558 --> 21:42.560
No...

21:42.661 --> 21:45.163
no, no...

21:45.263 --> 21:47.531
Pab...

21:47.632 --> 21:49.200
Pablo!

21:52.503 --> 21:53.905
No!

21:54.005 --> 21:55.606
No, Pablo!

21:59.911 --> 22:01.579
Pablo!
You're alive!

22:01.680 --> 22:03.314
You're alive!
Mm, mm!

22:10.755 --> 22:12.657
And you're not
all fucked up.

22:14.625 --> 22:17.295
Hey, I thought
I lost you,

22:17.395 --> 22:18.396
for real this time.

22:20.498 --> 22:22.400
Shit!
Where's Ash?

22:22.500 --> 22:23.802
Wow, okay.

22:23.902 --> 22:25.603
No, no, no. No, no, no.
Hey, hey Kel? Wha...?

22:25.704 --> 22:27.605
That was amazing.

22:29.340 --> 22:30.274
Fuck, Kelly.

22:30.374 --> 22:32.777
Shit's about to get
loco up in this bitch.

22:32.877 --> 22:35.413
And even though the Jefe
would never admit it...

22:35.513 --> 22:37.581
he can't defeat this
evil without me.

22:37.682 --> 22:40.618
You're right.
He'd never admit that.

22:40.719 --> 22:43.387
Wha... what?

22:45.690 --> 22:46.858
The end is coming.

22:46.958 --> 22:49.360
Shouldn't you take it
a little easy?

22:49.460 --> 22:51.329
Why?
I feel incredible.

22:53.798 --> 22:56.267
Pablo. What the fuck
just happened?

22:57.802 --> 22:59.670
Something especial.

23:02.440 --> 23:04.608
What?

23:04.709 --> 23:07.311
Uh, so, is he just normal now?

23:07.411 --> 23:08.546
Normal?

23:08.646 --> 23:10.681
I forgot what that
word even means.

23:13.584 --> 23:16.154
Look... I got to take
care of this.

23:16.254 --> 23:17.488
I need you to track
down your old man,

23:17.588 --> 23:18.757
fill him in on what
just happened.

23:18.857 --> 23:19.924
You think you could
do that for me?

23:20.024 --> 23:22.460
Yeah, I'll try
the hardware store.

23:22.560 --> 23:24.729
Hey, are you
going to be okay?

23:25.864 --> 23:27.231
I've been
through worse.

23:29.433 --> 23:31.135
Oh, Brandy.

23:31.235 --> 23:32.904
Stay the fuck away
from Ruby.

23:33.004 --> 23:35.639
You mean Ms. Prevett?

23:35.740 --> 23:37.408
Prevett.

23:37.508 --> 23:38.810
Yeah. Her.

23:46.717 --> 23:49.520
You fuck with
my Pablo...

23:49.620 --> 23:51.856
you fuck with me.

23:51.956 --> 23:55.693
And I'm done being
fucked with, Ruby.

23:58.863 --> 24:01.599
Damn it, where are you?

24:10.942 --> 24:12.811
Ah, Brandy,
I'm glad you're here,

24:12.911 --> 24:15.346
because your pop has
the 4-1-1 on evil.

24:15.446 --> 24:17.816
Uh, whatever this is...
Nothing to worry about.

24:17.916 --> 24:19.350
But I'm going to prove
to you once and for all

24:19.450 --> 24:21.752
that your Ms. Prevett,
is full of C.R.A.P.P.

24:21.853 --> 24:23.021
Brandy?

24:23.121 --> 24:24.588
Oh my God, I've been
looking everywhere.

24:24.688 --> 24:25.957
What's he doing now?

24:26.057 --> 24:28.960
Oh, I was just about
to expose your demon butt.

24:29.060 --> 24:31.262
Are you still
going on about that?

24:31.362 --> 24:33.731
Mr. Williams, you are
embarrassing yourself,

24:33.832 --> 24:35.800
and your daughter.
My God, this is so fucked.

24:35.900 --> 24:37.435
Ditto, minus
the swearing.

24:37.535 --> 24:39.904
Brandy, you don't actually
believe this nonsense

24:40.004 --> 24:41.672
that I'm some kind
of demon, do you?

24:41.772 --> 24:43.574
I'm not sure what
I believe anymore.

24:43.674 --> 24:45.543
Do we really need
all this yelling?

24:45.643 --> 24:46.811
I totally agree,
Sheriff.

24:46.911 --> 24:48.712
Just the person
I was looking for.

24:48.813 --> 24:50.014
Hey, why don't you save us
some time here,

24:50.114 --> 24:53.251
and spill the tequila about
your stupid demon son.

24:53.351 --> 24:55.719
I have no idea what
he's talking about.

24:55.820 --> 24:57.822
Let me jog your memory.

24:57.922 --> 25:01.492
Just so happens,
I've got that little monster...

25:01.592 --> 25:03.895
right here!

25:06.664 --> 25:08.432
Oh!
Mama.

25:08.532 --> 25:09.600
You...?
What the...?

25:09.700 --> 25:11.002
The hell is this?

25:12.670 --> 25:14.839
I know this looks bad,
but trust me,

25:14.939 --> 25:17.876
that cute little kid is a demon,
and not long ago,

25:17.976 --> 25:19.777
he was running around
inside a headless corpse

25:19.878 --> 25:21.512
of some
Scandinavian woman.

25:21.612 --> 25:22.713
He hurt me.

25:22.813 --> 25:24.348
Yeah. Should've.

25:24.448 --> 25:26.417
Oh, you animal!

25:26.517 --> 25:29.954
Kidnapping a defenseless child,
a new low even for you.

25:31.822 --> 25:33.424
Brandy...

25:33.524 --> 25:36.794
I know I'm a crappy father,
but I'm also a crappy liar.

25:36.895 --> 25:37.996
I've always
told you the truth,

25:38.096 --> 25:40.031
even if it sounds
creepy and weird.

25:40.131 --> 25:41.765
I mean, how do you
make this shit up?

25:41.866 --> 25:43.601
He's a menace to the community.

25:45.136 --> 25:47.471
You've got some explaining
to do, Mr. Williams.

25:47.571 --> 25:49.007
You know,
I have a spare room.

25:49.107 --> 25:50.541
Brandy can come back
to my place,

25:50.641 --> 25:52.110
I'll take care
of her.

25:52.210 --> 25:53.677
Brandy?

25:53.777 --> 25:56.080
Dad, get in!

25:56.180 --> 25:58.482
Mr. Williams!

25:58.582 --> 25:59.850
Ha! That's my daughter!

26:01.619 --> 26:04.022
You know, this is the first time
you ever called me Dad?

26:04.122 --> 26:05.489
Stop!

26:07.525 --> 26:09.994
Shit!
