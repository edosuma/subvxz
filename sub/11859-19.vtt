WEBVTT

00:10.625 --> 00:13.333
How'd you fare down at
Fort Benning, Mr.
Bellowes?

00:13.417 --> 00:14.667
Held my own, sir.

00:14.750 --> 00:17.125
Managed two degrees
inside of five
years.

00:17.208 --> 00:19.834
Studied straight through the
summers. Thanks to the GI
Bill.

00:19.917 --> 00:21.500
'All while working part-time'

00:21.583 --> 00:24.083
over at Dexter Broadman
Advertising, I see.

00:24.166 --> 00:27.750
I joined their creative side
full-time after Wharton.

00:27.834 --> 00:30.500
I'm surprised you
want to write ads

00:30.583 --> 00:32.166
for our little
family
operation.

00:32.250 --> 00:34.917
Well, I'm not one for
three-martini lunches, sir.

00:35.000 --> 00:36.750
I have bigger ideas.

00:36.834 --> 00:39.208
- And I know how to sell them.
- Such as?

00:39.291 --> 00:42.000
Well, Mr. Kemp, there's a
housing shortage here in
Philly.

00:42.083 --> 00:43.667
'I came out of the service
with Uncle Sam'

00:43.750 --> 00:46.417
backing my first mortgage
and not a patch of ground

00:46.500 --> 00:49.291
in this city to plant my
flag,
and I am not alone.

00:49.375 --> 00:50.500
I don't want
to
build
high-rises.

00:50.583 --> 00:52.792
I'm talking about
houses, sir.

00:52.875 --> 00:55.125
Neighborhoods of good men
and their families.

00:55.208 --> 00:57.333
I want to make you
the Henry Ford of housing.

00:57.417 --> 00:59.458
How exactly do you
plan to do that?

00:59.542 --> 01:01.792
'Well, I'd like
to show you.'

01:01.875 --> 01:04.500
You're gonna have to
take a ride with me.

01:10.250 --> 01:11.792
'Last summer, blight wrecked'

01:11.875 --> 01:15.125
the corn and potato crops
as far as the eye can see.

01:15.208 --> 01:18.959
There's 5,500 acres
sitting in the bargain bin.

01:19.041 --> 01:21.750
- Get to the point, son.
- Cities are crowded.

01:21.834 --> 01:23.542
Dirty, built on grids.

01:23.625 --> 01:25.917
Out here, the streets'll
be peaceful

01:26.000 --> 01:28.000
'winding, named
after colleges'

01:28.083 --> 01:29.667
flowers, pretty girls.

01:29.750 --> 01:33.667
Picture them lined
with ranch-style
houses.

01:33.750 --> 01:35.834
'Out front, a bright-green yard'

01:35.917 --> 01:37.458
and an apple tree.

01:37.542 --> 01:39.041
'We'll run print campaigns.'

01:39.125 --> 01:42.500
We'll-we'll open a...a
showroom
with plenty of fanfare

01:42.583 --> 01:44.375
and we'll call it..

01:44.458 --> 01:45.667
...Libertyville.

01:45.750 --> 01:47.000
'And when the good people'

01:47.083 --> 01:50.291
of Libertyville want
groceries, a haircut

01:50.375 --> 01:51.375
or, God forbid, a school--

01:51.458 --> 01:53.208
We build those, too!

01:53.291 --> 01:55.834
Shopping plazas with-with
plenty of parking.

01:55.917 --> 01:58.417
Recreation centers where
kids can play baseball.

01:58.500 --> 02:01.667
It'll be a whole new way
of life, the suburbs.

02:01.750 --> 02:05.166
Any thoughts on financing
this boondoggle?

02:05.250 --> 02:06.750
They'll buy on spec.

02:08.166 --> 02:09.583
Home ownership..

02:09.667 --> 02:12.208
...is the cornerstone
of the American dream.

02:12.291 --> 02:15.208
It is what makes
a man a man.

02:15.291 --> 02:17.542
You trust me, sir.

02:17.625 --> 02:20.458
We will sell out
before we break ground.

02:58.166 --> 03:01.083
Lilly, this is
Mrs. Chisholm.

03:01.166 --> 03:03.041
She's got
information
on a murder victim

03:03.125 --> 03:04.917
found out in
Somerton in
'58.

03:05.000 --> 03:07.709
- I'm Detective Rush.
- Hello.

03:07.792 --> 03:09.583
Thank you.

03:09.667 --> 03:11.750
His name was
Julian
Bellowes.

03:11.834 --> 03:13.667
Met him when I first
started out as a
maid.

03:13.750 --> 03:16.875
Gracious young man.
Worked for Harrison Kemp.

03:16.959 --> 03:18.333
Married the boss's daughter.

03:18.417 --> 03:20.333
Harrison Kemp
built Libertyville.

03:20.417 --> 03:21.959
Big suburban development
in Somerton.

03:22.041 --> 03:23.458
- Is that where you met him?
- No.

03:23.542 --> 03:26.166
The Kemps were members
of the Senators Club

03:26.250 --> 03:28.458
in Center City.
That's where I
worked.

03:28.542 --> 03:30.166
Place is a real
"Who's Who."

03:30.250 --> 03:34.458
The thing is, they said Julian
was killed out in the boonies

03:34.542 --> 03:37.291
'but I think it happened
right there at the club.'

03:37.375 --> 03:38.500
Why is that?

03:38.583 --> 03:40.458
'The night before
they found Julian'

03:40.542 --> 03:43.208
I was on my way
to clean the Legacy Room

03:43.291 --> 03:45.625
after one of Mr.
Kemp's
business meetings

03:45.709 --> 03:48.208
when I saw Julian
go back inside.

03:48.291 --> 03:52.583
As soon as the door closes
a fight break out.

03:52.667 --> 03:54.375
All kinds of yelling

03:54.458 --> 03:55.875
g-glass breaking.

03:55.959 --> 03:58.166
- What'd you do?
- Ran for help.

03:58.250 --> 03:59.792
Nobody around.

03:59.875 --> 04:02.000
I got back..

04:02.083 --> 04:04.458
...didn't
hear
a peep.

04:04.542 --> 04:07.250
So I looked inside.

04:22.750 --> 04:25.208
Never saw a meeting
end like that.

04:25.291 --> 04:26.875
You know who else
was in there?

04:26.959 --> 04:28.667
'Got a list.'

04:28.750 --> 04:31.041
Been thinking
about
it 50 years.

04:31.125 --> 04:32.333
You tell your boss?

04:32.417 --> 04:34.834
He said, "Clean up
and shut up"

04:34.917 --> 04:36.583
if I wanted to
keep my job.

04:36.667 --> 04:40.667
Mrs. Chisholm, why did you wait
so long to come forward?

04:40.750 --> 04:42.542
Just saw my doctor.

04:43.792 --> 04:46.834
Time to get my
house in order.

04:52.250 --> 04:55.375
If walls could talk, I'm
thinking these wouldn't.

04:55.458 --> 04:57.458
(Rush)
'The manager says the room
has barely changed'

04:57.542 --> 04:58.709
'in the last 50 years.'

04:58.792 --> 05:00.750
(Valens)
'Picking up on a theme here.'

05:00.834 --> 05:02.291
(Rush)
'Mary said Julian'

05:02.375 --> 05:05.083
walked through the door
to find his killer waiting.

05:05.166 --> 05:08.208
Guy approaches.
They get into it.

05:09.125 --> 05:11.333
Couple of swings right here.

05:12.625 --> 05:14.583
Somebody crashes into this.

05:14.667 --> 05:17.083
The glass Mary said
she heard breaking.

05:19.375 --> 05:21.125
This panel's different.

05:21.208 --> 05:22.458
Been replaced with
safety glass.

05:22.542 --> 05:24.625
'Old leaded stuff
breaks in shards'

05:24.709 --> 05:26.709
would have
crashed down.

05:26.792 --> 05:28.750
Evidence from
50 years ago.

05:29.542 --> 05:31.333
Hard to come by.

05:35.333 --> 05:37.166
Unless it has a place to hide.

05:45.792 --> 05:46.959
I got it.

05:58.458 --> 06:02.750
Walls may not talk, but
the floor's got something
say.

06:02.834 --> 06:04.291
(Valens)
'Residue.'

06:04.375 --> 06:06.250
- Could be blood.
- Mary's right.

06:06.333 --> 06:10.583
Whatever ended in that field
started right here.

06:46.875 --> 06:47.875
(Rush)
'Libertyville.'

06:47.959 --> 06:49.792
"The American dream
called home."

06:49.875 --> 06:51.083
(Jeffrie)
'Some American dream.'

06:51.166 --> 06:52.959
Thirty four year old
Julian Bellowes

06:53.041 --> 06:54.875
throat slit out in
the middle of nowhere.

06:54.959 --> 06:57.375
My aunt and uncle were
Libertyville pioneers.

06:57.458 --> 06:59.166
One night my Uncle Don
has too much to drink

06:59.250 --> 07:00.667
and walks into
the wrong house.

07:00.750 --> 07:02.417
They all looked
exactly alike.

07:04.417 --> 07:07.500
The wife, Caroline Kemp.
Handsome couple.

07:07.583 --> 07:09.333
M.E. says the
victim's
injury was caused

07:09.417 --> 07:11.458
by a serrated
blade or
glass.

07:11.542 --> 07:13.458
The evidence you found
in the Legacy Room

07:13.542 --> 07:14.667
could be our
murder weapon.

07:14.750 --> 07:15.834
So, he's killed
at the club

07:15.917 --> 07:17.667
then moved 15 miles
to Libertyville?

07:17.750 --> 07:19.333
(Jeffries)
'No I-95 back then.'

07:19.417 --> 07:21.333
Somerton was an
hour's drive
away.

07:21.417 --> 07:22.625
Felt like another planet.

07:22.709 --> 07:24.417
Couple of locals
reported a
drifter.

07:24.500 --> 07:26.166
Victim's
wallet
was missing.

07:26.250 --> 07:28.000
Assigned was
thinking
robbery.

07:28.083 --> 07:29.917
A robbery on a farm
in the middle of nowhere?

07:30.000 --> 07:31.250
How's that happen?

07:31.333 --> 07:32.500
Julian's headed out
there for business

07:32.583 --> 07:33.750
picks up this drifter.

07:33.834 --> 07:35.834
was
near the body.

07:35.917 --> 07:37.500
Let's see if the lab
can get a DNA sample

07:37.583 --> 07:39.333
from his wedding band,
compare it

07:39.417 --> 07:41.458
to the glass
samples
we gave 'em.

07:41.542 --> 07:43.583
Anything from the list
Mary Chisholm gave us?

07:43.667 --> 07:45.917
Maybe. Um, two
people stood out.

07:46.000 --> 07:48.875
Angelo Romano and
his son Paul.

07:48.959 --> 07:51.291
Yep. Those Romanos.

07:51.375 --> 07:53.500
Connected a family in
the
construction business.

07:53.583 --> 07:55.709
Slit throat. Could
have
been a mob hit.

07:55.792 --> 07:56.959
Hmm.

07:57.041 --> 07:58.709
Is that all we got?

07:58.792 --> 08:01.417
Julian's at the Senators Club
night before his body's found.

08:01.500 --> 08:03.333
Kemps are lifelong members there

08:03.417 --> 08:05.542
and not a single statement
from the place?

08:05.625 --> 08:08.208
No interviews with
the victim's family,
either.

08:08.291 --> 08:10.417
Why is this box so light?

08:10.500 --> 08:12.667
Good question, Lil. Let
me
know when you find out.

08:21.542 --> 08:24.667
Well, I have to admit I was
surprised by your call.

08:24.750 --> 08:26.792
The police didn't seem
to pay attention

08:26.875 --> 08:30.583
when my husband was killed,
never mind 50 years later.

08:30.667 --> 08:32.917
Hope to make up for that
the second time around.

08:33.000 --> 08:34.250
'My mother was only 22'

08:34.333 --> 08:36.125
when he was killed.

08:36.208 --> 08:37.917
She was pregnant with me.

08:38.000 --> 08:39.542
Completely distraught and..

08:39.625 --> 08:42.500
not much use to
the investigation, I'm afraid.

08:42.583 --> 08:44.959
Oh, it was...
it was a difficult time.

08:45.041 --> 08:48.500
There's no interviews from your
husband's coworkers or family.

08:48.583 --> 08:50.000
'Cops ever talk to you?'

08:50.083 --> 08:52.250
Only to tell me that
Julian had been

08:52.333 --> 08:53.417
murdered by a drifter.

08:53.500 --> 08:55.417
Your father was
Julian's boss.

08:55.500 --> 08:57.625
Any idea why he wouldn't
have given a statement?

08:57.709 --> 08:59.750
Are you saying there was
some sort of misconduct?

08:59.834 --> 09:02.417
No, got some...
blanks
to fill is all.

09:02.500 --> 09:05.333
Well, Julian was
estranged
from his family.

09:05.417 --> 09:06.750
He was close with mine.

09:06.834 --> 09:11.458
I guess silence was my
family's
way of...of grieving.

09:11.542 --> 09:13.500
We've got a
witness
who came forward.

09:13.583 --> 09:14.917
'Heard your husband
in a fight at'

09:15.000 --> 09:16.583
the Senators Club
night
before he died.

09:16.667 --> 09:19.875
He was at the club for a
business meeting with these
men.

09:19.959 --> 09:21.250
Recognize any of them?

09:23.458 --> 09:25.125
Well..

09:25.208 --> 09:27.083
...there's
Paul Romano.

09:27.166 --> 09:29.917
Isn't he the guy you were
dating when you met Daddy?

09:30.792 --> 09:32.667
A romance cultivated chiefly

09:32.750 --> 09:35.166
to drive my father
around the bend.

09:35.250 --> 09:38.083
No, it all changed
the moment I saw Julian.

09:38.166 --> 09:39.750
Three's a crowd?

09:39.834 --> 09:42.000
Paul didn't have
a chance.

09:52.709 --> 09:53.917
Cocktail?

09:54.000 --> 09:55.875
Paul, not here.

09:55.959 --> 09:58.667
It's my father's
birthday,
for heaven's sake.

09:58.750 --> 10:00.375
So let's take a walk.

10:00.458 --> 10:02.041
'He's gonna be 60
all year, right?'

10:02.125 --> 10:04.417
Maybe you'd like some
champagne instead?

10:07.583 --> 10:09.333
I thought I'd
die of thirst.

10:09.417 --> 10:12.208
I hate to think of you
being neglected.

10:12.291 --> 10:13.875
Think I can look
after my own date.

10:13.959 --> 10:16.709
Not from where I'm standing.

10:16.792 --> 10:18.333
Well, Paul doesn't cha-cha.

10:18.417 --> 10:21.959
Well, then he won't mind warming
the bench now, will you, sport?

10:22.041 --> 10:23.333
- Caroline.
- Daddy.

10:24.166 --> 10:25.917
This is Julian Bellowes.

10:26.041 --> 10:28.041
(Harry)
'I see he beat me
to an introduction.'

10:28.125 --> 10:33.041
You're the "Ivy League genius"
my father's been raving about?

10:34.291 --> 10:35.875
I was picturing
Coke-bottle
glasses.

10:35.959 --> 10:39.417
Well, I could go home
and get 'em, if you'd like.

10:39.500 --> 10:41.458
(Harry)
'Julian grew up
a stone's throw'

10:41.542 --> 10:44.542
from Rittenhouse Square,
graduated Wharton.

10:44.625 --> 10:47.000
We have so much
to talk about.

10:47.083 --> 10:48.291
Then shall we?

10:58.834 --> 11:00.333
Julian made
me feel like

11:00.417 --> 11:03.250
I was the only
woman in the room.

11:04.542 --> 11:06.166
We were engaged
a month later.

11:06.250 --> 11:10.041
I take it Paul wasn't too
happy
with your whirlwind romance.

11:10.125 --> 11:12.208
Oh, he was angry,
all right.

11:12.291 --> 11:13.750
So angry he slashed
Daddy's tires

11:13.834 --> 11:15.667
that night in
the parking lot, right?

11:15.750 --> 11:19.083
Julian was too much of a
gentleman to call the police.

11:23.583 --> 11:25.083
(Vera)
'Caroline Kemp.'

11:25.166 --> 11:27.166
She was a catch.

11:27.250 --> 11:30.333
If you're into
debutante
types.

11:30.417 --> 11:33.000
Saying you didn't mind Julian
Bellows making tracks with
her?

11:33.083 --> 11:35.792
Making tracks? The girl
was a prude.

11:35.875 --> 11:38.375
My dog Snowflake had
a better sex life

11:38.458 --> 11:40.750
than I did when
I was going with her.

11:40.834 --> 11:42.458
So, why did you
slash his tires?

11:42.542 --> 11:46.583
Big difference between slashing
Goodyears and killing someone.

11:46.667 --> 11:48.792
Yeah, except Julian's throat
was slashed, too.

11:48.875 --> 11:50.500
Making some kind
of implication?

11:50.583 --> 11:52.208
You got anger management
issues with the guy

11:52.291 --> 11:53.917
and I got a witness that puts
you at a meeting with him

11:54.000 --> 11:55.375
the night before he's dead.

11:55.458 --> 11:58.417
- That's circumstantial.
- Here's a circumstance for
you.

11:58.500 --> 12:01.667
Hear Romano Construction
specializes in cement
shoes.

12:01.750 --> 12:03.333
We start sniffing
around your sites

12:03.417 --> 12:06.917
we gonna find a
body
fresher than '58?

12:07.000 --> 12:08.750
Truth is..

12:08.834 --> 12:10.875
...I felt bad
for the kid.

12:10.959 --> 12:14.834
Getting in bed with
that Protestant family?

12:14.917 --> 12:16.542
You meet those people?

12:16.625 --> 12:18.875
They give you frostbite
just looking at you...

12:20.417 --> 12:24.250
Thirty percent off the top of
my
housing sales is unacceptable.

12:24.333 --> 12:27.291
That's even more
than last year.

12:27.375 --> 12:30.458
We been supplying you
quality building
materials

12:30.542 --> 12:32.417
over 16 years.

12:32.500 --> 12:33.667
'Without Romano Construction'

12:33.750 --> 12:35.333
you're nothing but blueprints.

12:35.417 --> 12:37.667
Capasso Brothers
in Camden are offering

12:37.750 --> 12:39.875
us a better price
with no profit share.

12:39.959 --> 12:42.333
The Capassos don't care
about your safety..

12:42.417 --> 12:43.834
...the way I do.

12:54.083 --> 12:56.083
We accept your offer.

12:57.208 --> 12:58.291
What?

12:59.250 --> 13:00.834
Now listen here,
Bellowes.

13:00.917 --> 13:04.750
- Dad, he can't just come
in--
- Harry. Not now.

13:04.834 --> 13:06.166
Go ahead.

13:06.250 --> 13:08.166
We'll pay your cut
on our builds in town

13:08.250 --> 13:13.041
in exchange for complete
control
of our profits in Somerton.

13:13.667 --> 13:15.083
Somerton?

13:15.166 --> 13:17.458
What, now you're going
to sell horse manure?

13:23.291 --> 13:24.458
You got a deal.

13:25.792 --> 13:29.500
Keep your spazzatura
farmland and God
bless.

13:38.208 --> 13:39.709
For the Romanos

13:39.792 --> 13:42.542
family is everything.
But not those people.

13:42.625 --> 13:45.750
Kemp, he didn't even know
his son left the room.

13:45.834 --> 13:48.625
So, Julian was squeezing Harry
out of the family business?

13:48.709 --> 13:50.208
Kid had the golden touch.

13:50.291 --> 13:52.875
That, uh, farmland
up in Somerton?

13:52.959 --> 13:54.583
That's Libertyville now.

13:54.667 --> 13:57.750
My father gets his cut,
we'd be havin' this chat

13:57.834 --> 13:59.333
on my own private island.

13:59.417 --> 14:02.250
You ever see Harry and
Julian getting into it?

14:02.333 --> 14:05.250
I saw Harry eating
his heart out plenty.

14:05.333 --> 14:07.083
But it took Julian dying

14:07.166 --> 14:10.375
for Harry to get his
seat back at the table.

14:18.125 --> 14:19.542
Can I help you?

14:22.000 --> 14:24.208
Philly Homicide. Thought
we'd congratulate you

14:24.291 --> 14:26.041
on your promotion
to Vice President.

14:26.125 --> 14:30.834
- 50 years late. 1960.
- '58, actually.

14:30.917 --> 14:33.208
November 30th, according to
the piece we found,

14:33.291 --> 14:34.583
<i>Business Week.</i>

14:34.667 --> 14:36.166
What's this about?

14:36.250 --> 14:38.000
(Valens)
'Your brother-in-law,
Julian Bellowes.'

14:38.083 --> 14:41.458
His murder, your big break.
Only three weeks apart.

14:41.542 --> 14:43.291
Where were you, night before
his body was found?

14:43.375 --> 14:47.041
I don't remember. To be honest,
I lost a couple of years there.

14:47.125 --> 14:48.208
Two of you get
along all right?

14:48.291 --> 14:49.542
Sure. He was my
brother-in-law.

14:49.625 --> 14:51.041
Family, don't you know?

14:51.125 --> 14:53.291
Right. So, any chance you were
with him at the Senators Club?

14:53.375 --> 14:56.500
- 'That's where he was.'
- Uh.

14:56.583 --> 14:59.083
- Told you I don't remember.
- 'Look at this.'

14:59.166 --> 15:00.959
November 6, 1958.

15:01.041 --> 15:03.625
Got your autograph on a bar
tab signed at midnight

15:03.709 --> 15:04.959
same time a witness heard

15:05.041 --> 15:07.208
Julian fighting with someone
in the Legacy Room.

15:07.291 --> 15:11.375
That much gin will rot your
gut,
Harry. Does other things too.

15:11.458 --> 15:12.792
I don't know where you're
going
with this.

15:12.875 --> 15:14.250
Julian made us a fortune.

15:14.333 --> 15:16.166
What was good for Kemp
and Sons was good for me.

15:16.250 --> 15:18.333
Well, the guy leapfrogs
you to Vice President

15:18.417 --> 15:21.250
gets tagged "Ivy League genius"
by your father

15:21.333 --> 15:23.333
and negotiates deals
while you're...

15:23.417 --> 15:24.583
stammering on the sidelines.

15:24.667 --> 15:26.166
That good for you?

15:26.250 --> 15:28.875
Slipping down the food chain
like a clown on a Vaseline
pole?

15:28.959 --> 15:32.041
Well, my ego got a little
bruised, but I got over it.

15:33.750 --> 15:36.834
Besides, Julian did
far worse to others.

15:39.959 --> 15:42.917
(Julian)
'So, we should have a contract
in hand in under 15 minutes.'

15:45.583 --> 15:48.291
There's ladies in tears
over the picture windows.

15:48.375 --> 15:51.125
Raw farmland, but they can
already imagine the fruit
trees.

15:51.208 --> 15:52.375
Give the people
what they want

15:52.458 --> 15:54.834
they stand in line
for it, Harrison.

15:54.917 --> 15:57.375
You think if we make you
our vice president of sales

15:57.458 --> 15:58.917
I can get you
to call me Dad?

15:59.000 --> 16:00.834
'You're engaged to
my daughter, after all.'

16:00.917 --> 16:04.375
- I'd be honored...Dad.
- Take your pick.

16:04.458 --> 16:06.333
You and Caroline are
going to need more room

16:06.417 --> 16:08.375
once you start
a family.

16:08.458 --> 16:10.375
Early wedding present.

16:10.458 --> 16:11.875
Bunch of thieves
stole my land!

16:11.959 --> 16:14.709
Been in my family
over 200 years!

16:14.792 --> 16:16.041
Julian Bellowes,
Kemp and Sons.

16:16.125 --> 16:17.458
Save the sales
pitch, mister.

16:17.542 --> 16:19.750
This Con man!
Convinced my senile

16:19.834 --> 16:22.500
old granddad to sign
on the dotted line.

16:22.583 --> 16:23.834
Don't believe
a word he
says.

16:23.917 --> 16:27.000
If it is land you want,
it is land you'll get.

16:27.083 --> 16:28.083
Please.

16:28.166 --> 16:31.041
Please, let me see
what I can do for you.

16:34.834 --> 16:36.583
Julian was trying
to make it right.

16:36.667 --> 16:39.041
I mean, charming,
full of ideas.

16:39.125 --> 16:41.250
Those attributes were
lost on that hick.

16:41.333 --> 16:45.750
- Old McDonald got a name?
- Julian negotiated the deal.

16:45.834 --> 16:48.333
And you decided not to tell
the cops about this incident

16:48.417 --> 16:51.625
even when Julian shows up dead
in the same neck of the woods?

16:52.834 --> 16:55.542
We were selling
houses on spec.

16:55.625 --> 16:59.291
If people thought we were
robbing farmers of their land

16:59.375 --> 17:01.792
it would have
decimated sales.

17:02.917 --> 17:04.208
(Vera)
'Tracked down the families'

17:04.291 --> 17:06.125
who sold their
land
to Kemp and Sons.

17:06.208 --> 17:07.667
Casey Hollenbeck
filed a complaint

17:07.750 --> 17:08.917
with the Better
Business Bureau.

17:09.000 --> 17:11.250
Arrested in '62
for disorderly conduct.

17:11.333 --> 17:14.375
Guy spent his life raising
and slaughtering livestock
so

17:14.458 --> 17:16.041
he would have known
his way around a
knife.

17:16.125 --> 17:18.333
Lived two miles from
where
Julian's body was found.

17:18.417 --> 17:20.166
You, uh, check out any
of those Libertyville

17:20.250 --> 17:21.583
homes while you were
out there, Nick?

17:21.667 --> 17:23.875
Matter of fact, saw a
few "for sale" signs.

17:23.959 --> 17:26.709
- Might look into it.
- Well, interest rates are
low.

17:26.792 --> 17:28.000
Time to act is now.

17:28.083 --> 17:30.750
Where is this
Casey Hollenbeck today?

17:30.834 --> 17:33.291
Died in '94.
I'm looking for anyone

17:33.375 --> 17:35.000
who might have seen him
at Julian's office.

17:35.083 --> 17:37.000
Julian's secretary
still around?

17:37.083 --> 17:38.667
Yeah, uh, Joan Rasky.

17:38.750 --> 17:40.709
- On her way in now.
- Lab report's back.

17:40.792 --> 17:43.083
DNA from the glass
in the heating vent

17:43.166 --> 17:44.417
doesn't match Julian.

17:44.500 --> 17:45.458
Working on whose
it might be.

17:45.542 --> 17:46.959
You have a swab
from Harry?

17:47.041 --> 17:49.291
Paul Romano, too.

17:49.375 --> 17:51.875
What? I'm not going to
sit
in the corner and knit.

17:51.959 --> 17:55.583
Pace yourself, Will. I don't
want you busting a stitch.

17:55.667 --> 17:57.166
Got Julian's bank records.

17:57.250 --> 18:00.125
Guy wrote over $2,000
worth of checks to
cash.

18:00.208 --> 18:03.375
Hundred bucks a week, every
week, leading up to his
murder.

18:03.458 --> 18:05.792
Two thousand clams. That's
a lot of cash back then.

18:05.875 --> 18:08.583
Gambling,
mistress,
drugs.

18:08.667 --> 18:09.959
Or a payoff.

18:11.083 --> 18:14.250
I worked with
Mr. Bellowes

18:14.333 --> 18:19.792
from February of '58 until
he passed away that November.

18:19.875 --> 18:21.917
A farmer out
of Somerton, uh

18:22.000 --> 18:25.333
Casey Hollenbeck...had
a gripe with Julian.

18:25.417 --> 18:27.333
Did he ever show up
at Julian's office?

18:27.417 --> 18:29.500
Angry as sin.

18:29.583 --> 18:32.667
But Mr. Bellowes
patched
it up with him, of
course.

18:32.750 --> 18:33.792
How did he do that?

18:33.875 --> 18:35.333
Well, he just explained

18:35.417 --> 18:38.250
that this city
was
sprawling north

18:38.333 --> 18:39.834
whether he
liked it or
not

18:39.917 --> 18:43.333
and he set his whole
family
up in Libertyville homes.

18:43.417 --> 18:46.041
We found weekly checks
made out to cash

18:46.125 --> 18:48.000
in his personal
records.

18:48.083 --> 18:51.792
Any chance Julian
was paying him off?

18:51.875 --> 18:54.333
You know, I really
don't
have any information

18:54.417 --> 18:57.333
about his personal
accounts Detective.

18:58.542 --> 19:00.291
Julian's gone, Joan.

19:01.333 --> 19:02.333
And the person
who killed him

19:02.417 --> 19:04.041
might still
be out there.

19:11.125 --> 19:14.709
I put those checks in
the mail once a week

19:14.792 --> 19:16.834
but not to a
Mr.
Hollenbeck.

19:18.375 --> 19:21.333
They were addressed
to an R. Reynolds.

19:21.417 --> 19:22.750
Any idea who that was?

19:22.834 --> 19:25.375
I didn't know,
and I didn't
ask.

19:25.458 --> 19:28.041
And then, one day,
the answer came walking
in.

19:40.208 --> 19:42.375
I'm here to see
Mr. Bellowes.

19:45.333 --> 19:47.750
- Your name?
- Mrs. Regina Reynolds.

19:47.834 --> 19:50.750
I'm sorry, Mrs. Reynolds.
Do you have an appointment?

19:50.834 --> 19:53.083
It's urgent.

19:53.166 --> 19:56.041
Mr. Bellowes is behind
closed doors at the moment.

19:57.917 --> 19:59.458
Well, you can let
Mr. Bellowes know

19:59.542 --> 20:01.458
I am not one for
causing a scene

20:01.542 --> 20:03.834
but I am happy
to give it a whirl.

20:13.208 --> 20:14.542
Take five,
Mrs. Libertyville.

20:14.625 --> 20:16.959
There's a woman here to
see you, Mr. Bellowes.

20:17.041 --> 20:19.458
She's, um...a Negro.

20:28.041 --> 20:29.333
What are you doing here?

20:29.417 --> 20:30.917
- We have an agreement.
- This can't wait.

20:31.000 --> 20:34.250
Now is not the time.
I'll call you.

20:34.333 --> 20:36.041
I promise.

20:39.875 --> 20:42.875
So, you can imagine
the scandal in 1958.

20:42.959 --> 20:45.917
Do you happen to remember the
address you sent those checks?

20:46.000 --> 20:50.875
I do. I typed it so many
times
it's in the permanent
file.

20:50.959 --> 20:54.917
22-21, Robman Street.

21:00.625 --> 21:03.000
- Sorry I'm late.
- Thanks for joining me.

21:03.083 --> 21:05.542
Figured, as long as I was
going
to be in Philly, well--

21:05.625 --> 21:07.250
I can't pass up Chinese.

21:09.166 --> 21:10.750
Remember this place?

21:10.834 --> 21:12.625
Brought you here
when you were a kid.

21:12.709 --> 21:14.625
Used to have an aquarium
by the door.

21:14.709 --> 21:16.333
Oh, with the angelfish.

21:17.333 --> 21:19.208
Christmas.

21:19.291 --> 21:20.583
We'd come here at
Christmastime.

21:20.667 --> 21:22.250
Red lanterns,
close as we

21:22.333 --> 21:24.375
were going to get
to decorations.

21:28.709 --> 21:30.834
'Still love the holidays.'

21:32.750 --> 21:34.542
Yeah.

21:34.625 --> 21:35.750
Sure.

21:39.875 --> 21:42.375
You know, she didn't
mess it all up.

21:43.542 --> 21:47.041
'One year I was six.'

21:47.125 --> 21:51.875
Well, we skipped the
Chinese,
but not the gin, and..

21:51.959 --> 21:56.709
...and I helped her walk
home,
and she was so...sad.

21:56.792 --> 21:58.667
Said we didn't have
any money for
presents

21:58.750 --> 22:00.709
but when we got home

22:00.792 --> 22:04.000
there was this
bike
on the steps.

22:04.083 --> 22:06.959
Red Huffy with
a banana seat.

22:07.959 --> 22:09.291
I don't know.

22:09.375 --> 22:11.583
Maybe she had some kind
of pull with Santa.

22:13.875 --> 22:15.500
'Why you looking
at me like that?'

22:15.583 --> 22:18.291
Ask Santa. I'm sworn
to secrecy.

22:19.542 --> 22:21.125
I loved that bike.

22:24.208 --> 22:26.542
I, uh, went ahead
and ordered.

22:26.625 --> 22:29.583
You need a menu or you
know what you want?

22:29.667 --> 22:32.375
Um, sesame noodles,
Szechuan green beans

22:32.458 --> 22:34.709
and hot and sour soup.

22:37.834 --> 22:39.542
Something I said?

22:39.625 --> 22:42.500
'Great minds
think alike.'

22:42.583 --> 22:44.500
Sesame noodles.

22:44.583 --> 22:46.667
'Szechuan green beans.'

22:46.750 --> 22:48.750
Guess the soup's
still on its way.

22:50.208 --> 22:52.083
Eat before they get cold.

22:56.375 --> 22:58.792
22-21, Robman Street.

23:00.083 --> 23:01.417
Pissed-off white guy
from work

23:01.500 --> 23:03.125
can't handle Julian's
taste in women

23:03.208 --> 23:05.417
follows him back
to Regina's place.

23:06.834 --> 23:08.250
White guy?

23:08.333 --> 23:10.792
How do you think Regina's black
husband was gonna take it?

23:10.875 --> 23:13.667
His wife cheating on
him with Julian.

23:13.750 --> 23:14.917
You got a point.

23:19.875 --> 23:23.625
- Regina Reynolds?
- Yes?

23:23.709 --> 23:26.041
Few questions about
Julian Bellowes.

23:26.125 --> 23:29.083
- Remember him?
- "Remember him?"

23:29.166 --> 23:30.834
Two of you
were involved?

23:33.250 --> 23:34.959
Of course we were.

23:35.875 --> 23:38.417
Julian was my brother.

23:43.667 --> 23:46.375
(Regina)
'Our mother was Creole.'

23:46.458 --> 23:48.792
Plenty of light-skinned
folks in our community

23:48.875 --> 23:53.041
but Julian was by
far the lightest.

23:53.125 --> 23:55.166
Kids gave him a hard time

23:55.250 --> 23:58.417
for not being black enough.

23:58.500 --> 24:00.834
'Made him a man
without a country.'

24:00.917 --> 24:02.083
How were things at home?

24:02.166 --> 24:04.208
Julian came back
from the service.

24:04.291 --> 24:06.041
Living as a white man.

24:06.125 --> 24:09.333
My father felt that he
had lost his only son

24:09.417 --> 24:12.542
but he never
would
have hurt him.

24:12.625 --> 24:16.166
What was so urgent, had you
showing up at his office?

24:16.250 --> 24:18.500
Our father was dying.

24:18.583 --> 24:21.750
- I wanted Julian to know.
- Julian ever send you money?

24:21.834 --> 24:26.000
Every week without fail.
Think it eased his conscience.

24:26.083 --> 24:29.041
Of course, we would
have traded every dime

24:29.125 --> 24:31.875
to have him
around instead.

24:31.959 --> 24:34.375
Anyone you know find out
what Julian was doing?

24:34.458 --> 24:36.875
Secret like that

24:36.959 --> 24:39.709
it's bound to
catch
up with you.

24:41.291 --> 24:42.834
I see you got married.

24:45.583 --> 24:47.041
Her name's Caroline.

24:48.125 --> 24:49.625
She's a wonderful girl.

24:53.458 --> 24:55.542
How much longer
does he have?

24:56.500 --> 24:58.750
Doctor says we're
at the end.

24:58.834 --> 25:00.500
It's not too
late, Julian.

25:00.583 --> 25:03.959
- It's Daddy.
- He won't want to see me.

25:08.208 --> 25:09.667
Caroline's expecting.

25:11.250 --> 25:13.709
- We're gonna have a baby.
- 'A baby?'

25:13.792 --> 25:15.041
But what happens if--

25:15.125 --> 25:16.875
I haven't been able
to sleep in weeks.

25:21.417 --> 25:22.458
Julian.

25:24.041 --> 25:26.583
You've got to get
ahead of this.

25:26.667 --> 25:28.083
Lieutenant Bellowes.

25:29.667 --> 25:31.709
George Watson
from Fort Benning.

25:33.000 --> 25:34.709
I think you're mistaken.

25:38.583 --> 25:40.125
about

25:40.917 --> 25:42.750
This is you, isn't it?

25:45.208 --> 25:46.792
'Your wife sure
is pretty.'

25:46.875 --> 25:49.959
Sure have done well for
yourself, Lieutenant Bellowes.

25:50.041 --> 25:51.208
Is there something
I can help you with?

25:51.291 --> 25:52.667
Come to think of it,
there is.

25:52.750 --> 25:56.041
Like to come to that office
of yours sometime.

25:56.125 --> 25:58.166
Catch up, talk business.

26:00.083 --> 26:01.417
You have a card?

26:05.375 --> 26:07.250
Call first, alright?

26:14.875 --> 26:16.500
That was the last time
I saw him.

26:16.583 --> 26:20.709
He never got a chance to say
good-bye to my father.

26:20.792 --> 26:21.792
(Valens)
'George Watson.'

26:21.875 --> 26:24.291
He the one with
the carpet company?

26:24.375 --> 26:25.750
- Seen his ads.
- That's him.

26:25.834 --> 26:27.834
He was just getting
started back then.

26:27.917 --> 26:29.333
Why didn't you tell
the cops about this

26:29.417 --> 26:31.333
when you found out
Julian was murdered?

26:31.417 --> 26:33.333
I was a stranger

26:33.417 --> 26:36.792
at my own brother's
funeral, wondering

26:36.875 --> 26:38.792
who all those people were.

26:39.583 --> 26:41.208
What they meant to him.

26:42.959 --> 26:44.208
I realized that

26:44.291 --> 26:46.291
he belonged to them now.

26:47.750 --> 26:51.125
And if that's the way
he wanted it

26:51.208 --> 26:54.250
I was going to
honor his wishes.

27:02.583 --> 27:06.125
When's the last time you saw
Julian Bellowes, George?

27:06.208 --> 27:07.625
In the service.

27:07.709 --> 27:09.125
Fort Benning, Georgia.

27:09.208 --> 27:10.709
'Peacetime enlistment.'

27:10.792 --> 27:14.417
A witness saw Julian
give
you his business card.

27:14.500 --> 27:16.041
Hot Skillet Diner
South Philly

27:16.125 --> 27:17.917
few weeks before
he was killed.

27:18.000 --> 27:22.333
You're right. Sorry,
Detective,
that was a long time ago.

27:22.417 --> 27:25.583
Anything in particular you
wanted to discuss with Julian?

27:25.667 --> 27:28.625
Let me see. Um, I was
interested
in some work

27:28.709 --> 27:30.792
he was doing up
in Somerton.

27:30.875 --> 27:32.125
You wanted to buy
a Libertyville
property?

27:32.208 --> 27:33.709
No, not at all.

27:33.792 --> 27:36.959
I was interested in laying
carpet in all those new
builds.

27:37.041 --> 27:40.083
We found your name in Julian's
office phone records.

27:40.166 --> 27:42.041
You left more than
ten messages for him.

27:42.125 --> 27:44.166
Successful men don't
take
no for an answer.

27:44.250 --> 27:46.583
That's the way
I built my
company.

27:46.667 --> 27:49.917
Any disciplinary issues when
you were in the Army, George?

27:50.000 --> 27:51.417
(Stillman)
'Dug up your service record.'

27:51.500 --> 27:54.834
Three non-judicial
punishments
in your first tour

27:54.917 --> 27:58.625
all from
Lieutenant Julian
Bellowes.

27:58.709 --> 28:00.041
(George)
'W-Wait a second, now.'

28:00.125 --> 28:02.750
He treated me fair.
Same as the rest.

28:02.834 --> 28:05.500
Must have made you angry,
seeing him in that diner

28:05.583 --> 28:10.333
realizing the guy who'd been
so
tough on you was pretending.

28:10.417 --> 28:13.709
I was angry because
he denied knowing me.

28:13.792 --> 28:18.583
Truth is, I'd known for a long
time the secret he was hiding.

28:20.625 --> 28:22.792
Man, I don't know about
that Army barber.

28:22.875 --> 28:25.917
I mean, he gonna know
what to do with my kitchen?

28:26.000 --> 28:27.208
You seem to be
in decent
shape.

28:27.291 --> 28:29.417
Tell him to
use
the clippers.

28:29.500 --> 28:31.000
Private Bellowes.

28:32.875 --> 28:34.250
Yes, sir?

28:35.834 --> 28:37.125
Soldier, how'd you get
through school

28:37.208 --> 28:38.959
with grades like this
and never learn

28:39.041 --> 28:41.500
how to check a box?

28:41.583 --> 28:43.875
You marked "Negro"
instead of "white."

28:44.875 --> 28:46.333
Excuse me?

28:46.417 --> 28:50.208
'You could've ended up on KP
duty for the rest of your
tour.'

28:50.291 --> 28:53.333
Unless you'd rather peel
potatoes than command a unit.

29:01.375 --> 29:03.625
My mistake.

29:05.291 --> 29:07.959
'Now, report to Company
First Sergeant in Processing'

29:08.041 --> 29:09.333
'before they close.'

29:09.417 --> 29:10.875
Yes, sir.

29:16.417 --> 29:18.500
Julian had a choice.

29:18.583 --> 29:20.625
A way to be
treated better.

29:21.750 --> 29:23.542
Who was I to
stand in his way?

29:23.625 --> 29:26.125
(Rush)
'He ever give you that carpet
contract you were after?'

29:26.208 --> 29:29.166
No. I guess he was afraid I
would tell someone his
secret.

29:29.250 --> 29:32.083
I thought successful men
didn't take no for an
answer.

29:32.166 --> 29:35.333
Look, I didn't
begrudge the man.

29:35.417 --> 29:37.333
If I'd had
the same choice

29:37.417 --> 29:39.458
no idea what
I would've done.

29:43.625 --> 29:46.250
- 'Thank you.'
- Ma'am?

29:46.333 --> 29:48.417
The family I..

29:48.500 --> 29:50.291
...I always
wanted to
meet.

29:50.375 --> 29:52.667
He told me they had
nothing in common.

29:52.750 --> 29:55.917
They'd had a falling out
over Julian's career
plans.

29:56.000 --> 29:58.125
It's something much
bigger than that.

29:58.208 --> 30:01.542
Now that you know,
it shed any light?

30:01.625 --> 30:05.500
It explains what he
was
trying to tell me.

30:08.750 --> 30:09.792
Julian.

30:10.875 --> 30:12.500
'You all right?'

30:15.166 --> 30:16.750
I'm fine.

30:18.041 --> 30:19.667
You should go
back to sleep.

30:19.750 --> 30:22.125
Can't remember the last
time you weren't awake

30:22.208 --> 30:23.583
half the night.

30:25.250 --> 30:26.625
Is it about the baby?

30:26.709 --> 30:28.917
Are you nervous about
becoming a father?

30:33.291 --> 30:35.291
Of course not.

30:35.375 --> 30:38.709
Is it about Harry?

30:38.792 --> 30:39.959
What do you mean?

30:40.041 --> 30:42.417
He's got the silliest thing
stuck in his craw.

30:42.500 --> 30:45.750
He had a conversation
with Gene Reilly.

30:45.834 --> 30:48.291
Gene's a deacon
over at All Souls.

30:48.375 --> 30:52.417
It was so strange, but Gene says
he's never heard of your family.

30:52.500 --> 30:54.000
I told Harry he
must be mistaken.

30:54.083 --> 30:56.458
There's got to be
more than one All Souls.

30:58.208 --> 31:00.583
I know you don't like me
to bring up your family

31:00.667 --> 31:03.166
and I promised myself
I'd stop asking

31:03.250 --> 31:08.083
but...well, there's
gonna be a baby.

31:08.166 --> 31:11.041
Your parents are gonna
be grandparents.

31:14.000 --> 31:15.542
And they made you.

31:17.041 --> 31:19.083
Which makes me love them.

31:23.917 --> 31:28.250
There's so much that you
don't
know about me, Caroline.

31:29.500 --> 31:31.375
You mean you don't actually
like to cha-cha?

31:31.458 --> 31:33.166
I'm serious.

31:35.583 --> 31:38.041
There's nothing
you could tell me

31:38.125 --> 31:40.625
that would make me
stop loving you.

31:44.792 --> 31:46.208
Thank you.

31:53.583 --> 31:55.417
I thought he was..

31:55.500 --> 31:59.417
...he was worried about
coming from modest means.

31:59.500 --> 32:02.083
What a world
we lived in

32:02.166 --> 32:05.834
that he felt he
couldn't
tell me the truth.

32:05.917 --> 32:08.542
You said Harry was looking
into Julian's past.

32:08.625 --> 32:11.917
It possible he found out
about your husband's secret?

32:13.667 --> 32:15.500
My brother would
have told me.

32:17.709 --> 32:19.542
Wouldn't he?

32:24.208 --> 32:26.458
The hell you still
doing here, Will?

32:26.542 --> 32:29.500
Could ask you
the same thing.

32:29.583 --> 32:31.208
Fair enough.

32:31.291 --> 32:32.500
Lab results came back.

32:32.583 --> 32:35.083
Blood on the broken glass
from the Legacy Room

32:35.166 --> 32:37.125
was Harry Kemp, Junior's.

32:38.959 --> 32:40.208
Night before he died

32:40.291 --> 32:42.291
Julian was fighting
with
his brother-in-law.

32:42.375 --> 32:45.542
Caroline said he had been
looking into Julian's past.

32:47.458 --> 32:50.667
Sounds like it finally
caught up with him.

32:52.417 --> 32:53.917
Well, last time we
spoke you stated

32:54.000 --> 32:56.250
you and Julian
were pretty tight.

32:56.333 --> 32:58.208
- Family, you said.
- Uh, that's right, yeah.

32:58.291 --> 32:59.875
You got a little
detective
in you, Harry?

32:59.959 --> 33:01.709
(Valens)
'Looking into Julian's
past.'

33:01.792 --> 33:04.208
Sniffing around
the church he went to.

33:04.291 --> 33:06.208
In 1958, where
you
went to church

33:06.291 --> 33:08.125
was your
family's
social circle.

33:08.208 --> 33:09.834
I mean, when he told me

33:09.917 --> 33:11.417
that he went to
All Souls, I--

33:11.500 --> 33:14.041
You-You wanted to know where
this cowboy rode in from.

33:14.125 --> 33:17.375
Looking for a crack in
that smooth veneer of
his.

33:17.458 --> 33:18.792
Yeah, maybe.

33:18.875 --> 33:20.375
(Valens)
'You found out he
didn't go there.'

33:20.458 --> 33:21.709
Never had.

33:21.792 --> 33:23.709
Guy lied to your
father, your sister.

33:23.792 --> 33:25.083
Wonder why he'd lie
like that, Harry?

33:25.166 --> 33:26.792
I don't know.

33:26.875 --> 33:29.458
You know, my mom

33:29.542 --> 33:32.458
always warned me
not to drink gin.

33:32.542 --> 33:35.000
Said it messed
with your head.

33:35.083 --> 33:36.583
Could make you do
things
you didn't mean to.

33:36.667 --> 33:39.208
And you loved your
gin martini, Harry.

33:39.291 --> 33:42.792
Tossing 'em back in the Legacy
Room. Then Julian comes back.

33:42.875 --> 33:45.709
Told us it wasn't you
fighting with him that
night.

33:45.792 --> 33:47.458
You want to stick
with that story?

33:47.542 --> 33:48.917
Julian's
throat
got sliced.

33:49.000 --> 33:51.291
- Could have been broken glass.
- So?

33:51.375 --> 33:53.667
The blood on the pieces
we found in the Legacy Room?

33:53.750 --> 33:55.583
Guess whose DNA.

33:55.667 --> 33:59.208
You know, juries love
that DNA evidence, Harry.

33:59.291 --> 34:02.458
If I was you, I'd start
cooking up an alibi.

34:02.542 --> 34:04.250
I didn't want to hurt him.

34:05.166 --> 34:07.375
I just wanted
the truth.

34:14.041 --> 34:15.792
Harry.

34:17.291 --> 34:20.792
Look, I know you've been
talking to Caroline about me.

34:23.458 --> 34:25.792
You got a problem
with that, Julian?

34:29.333 --> 34:31.000
She's my damn sister.

34:31.083 --> 34:33.291
Come on. I'm, I'm here
to come clean.

34:34.250 --> 34:37.125
You lied about where
you grew up.

34:37.208 --> 34:39.458
You lied
about
who you are.

34:39.542 --> 34:41.500
Who are you,
you damn fraud?

34:41.583 --> 34:43.625
Okay. We'll talk
when you're
sober.

34:43.709 --> 34:46.333
Father's betting
everything on a con man

34:46.417 --> 34:50.375
while I'm stuck in the
stockroom
sharpening pencils!

34:53.417 --> 34:55.834
I know you've gotten a raw
deal
ever since I showed up.

34:55.917 --> 34:57.041
Yes.

34:57.125 --> 34:59.041
But everyone deserves a shot
to prove themselves

34:59.125 --> 35:02.792
and I'm going to make sure
your father gives you yours.

35:02.875 --> 35:04.667
Why the hell should
I believe you?

35:04.750 --> 35:07.709
I lied about who I
was because I had
to.

35:07.792 --> 35:10.500
It was the only way
for me to be myself

35:10.583 --> 35:13.458
and not be trapped
by where I come from.

35:13.542 --> 35:16.000
And where the hell is that?

35:18.750 --> 35:21.875
Abyssinian Baptist is a couple
of blocks north of here.

35:23.375 --> 35:25.542
That's where I was baptized.

35:25.625 --> 35:28.333
That's where my whole
family was baptized.

35:29.500 --> 35:31.291
Right there..

35:31.375 --> 35:33.834
...is where I grew up.

35:35.166 --> 35:37.125
My father is a carpenter.

35:38.750 --> 35:41.291
His name is
James Ridley Bellowes.

35:48.000 --> 35:49.834
He's a Negro, Harry.

35:51.458 --> 35:52.750
So am I.

35:54.166 --> 35:56.291
You're related to them?

35:56.959 --> 35:58.750
I'm their son.

36:00.959 --> 36:04.166
You remember the old saw
about judging a book?

36:08.166 --> 36:10.125
Does my sister know?

36:10.208 --> 36:12.875
I'm gonna tell her next.

36:12.959 --> 36:16.375
Figured I'd start with
my toughest customer.

36:22.208 --> 36:25.083
- What's the party for?
- 'It's not a party.'

36:25.166 --> 36:27.583
They're saying
good-bye to
him.

36:27.667 --> 36:28.750
Who?

36:31.166 --> 36:33.000
My father.

36:35.417 --> 36:37.583
He's dying.

36:37.667 --> 36:40.417
Why aren't you in
there with them?

36:40.500 --> 36:43.208
There's something
I got to make right.

36:45.333 --> 36:47.709
When I do, that's when
I can go home again.

36:53.875 --> 36:55.792
I don't know,
He dropped me off

36:55.875 --> 36:57.917
Drove me home.
Never saw him again.

36:58.000 --> 37:00.542
Anyone else find out?
Your father maybe?

37:00.625 --> 37:02.792
Julian's death
destroyed Dad.

37:02.875 --> 37:07.959
I got the feeling he wished it
had been me instead of Julian.

37:08.041 --> 37:10.375
So I told him the secret.

37:11.667 --> 37:13.542
You never saw tears
dry up so fast.

37:13.625 --> 37:15.750
'"Don't tell Caroline."
That's all he said.'

37:15.834 --> 37:17.542
Went in his office,
shut the door

37:17.625 --> 37:18.709
started working
the phones.

37:18.792 --> 37:20.125
Well, who was
he calling?

37:20.208 --> 37:21.417
Well, his high-placed
friends.

37:21.500 --> 37:23.333
Put a lid on the whole
investigation.

37:23.417 --> 37:25.500
Julian said there was
something
he needed to make right

37:25.583 --> 37:27.959
before he could go home again?
You know what that was?

37:28.041 --> 37:30.125
Yeah, he wanted to
integrate
Libertyville.

37:30.208 --> 37:32.375
He'd already
implemented
the idea.

37:32.458 --> 37:33.500
Well, how so?

37:33.583 --> 37:34.792
A few weeks
before his death

37:34.875 --> 37:37.458
he preapproved a loan
for a mortgage.

37:37.542 --> 37:40.333
The first black family.

37:40.417 --> 37:43.000
- You remember who they were?
- No, I never did know.

37:43.083 --> 37:44.583
Took another 25 years

37:44.667 --> 37:46.834
for the first black family
to move into Libertyville.

37:46.917 --> 37:50.041
Libertyville handled its own
mortgage applications.

37:50.125 --> 37:54.166
- You still got those records?
- There's a storage facility.

37:54.250 --> 37:59.333
- And 50 years of paperwork.
- You dig, Harry. I'll watch.

38:06.125 --> 38:07.834
Give me a shot
at this guy, John.

38:07.917 --> 38:09.625
Doc said restricted duty.

38:09.709 --> 38:13.583
The only thing that's gonna
cure me is doing my job.

38:18.959 --> 38:20.500
Go on. Get in there.

38:28.208 --> 38:29.583
(Rush)
'You told us you
had no interest'

38:29.667 --> 38:32.792
in a Libertyville home,
George.
Look what we found.

38:32.875 --> 38:36.959
A mortgage application for a
model called The
Philadelphian.

38:40.083 --> 38:41.375
That you, George?

38:41.458 --> 38:44.083
Well, that-that
looks
like my signature.

38:44.166 --> 38:47.000
(Rush)
'This is where it says
you've been preapproved.'

38:47.083 --> 38:49.709
- Whose name's that?
- It's Julian Bellowes.

38:49.792 --> 38:51.917
What happened, George?
Know you never lived there.

38:52.000 --> 38:53.750
I don't remember.
A long time ago.

38:53.834 --> 38:57.250
(Rush)
'Well, mortgage was being
set up at Emerson Mutual'

38:57.333 --> 38:58.583
Center City branch.

38:58.667 --> 39:00.083
Everything was
going through.

39:00.166 --> 39:03.667
Until that morning,
November 7, 1958.

39:03.750 --> 39:05.917
(Jeffries)
'When you went to the bank
to pick up your check'

39:06.000 --> 39:08.625
they told you you couldn't
have that loan after all.

39:10.000 --> 39:11.792
I built my company
from scratch.

39:11.875 --> 39:14.875
12 stores in
the tri-state area.

39:14.959 --> 39:17.291
- Ads on television.
- 'Had your wife with you.'

39:17.375 --> 39:19.583
Must have been hard
having them tell you

39:19.667 --> 39:22.125
they'd changed their mind
right in front of her.

39:22.208 --> 39:25.125
Put three kids through
college without help.

39:25.208 --> 39:26.625
Did it all myself.

39:26.709 --> 39:30.500
(Jeffries)
'Look, reversing your
application like that.'

39:30.583 --> 39:32.625
I know what happened.

39:36.583 --> 39:39.125
They saw the color
of your skin.

39:39.208 --> 39:43.083
Keep your grass mowed
and kids on point.

39:43.166 --> 39:46.083
Smile friendly
and never complain.

39:48.625 --> 39:50.125
Still..

39:50.208 --> 39:52.417
...the neighbors
are nervous.

39:52.500 --> 39:53.834
I know.

39:53.917 --> 39:56.834
I lived next door
to 'em myself.

39:56.917 --> 39:58.959
I know exactly what
you would have done

39:59.041 --> 40:01.166
if you had the choice
Julian Bellowes had.

40:01.250 --> 40:05.000
Hell, George, we both would
have done the same damn thing.

40:05.083 --> 40:08.083
- Taken it.
- Yeah.

40:09.417 --> 40:10.792
(Jeffries)
'Black or not'

40:10.875 --> 40:12.542
Julian had no idea

40:12.625 --> 40:15.917
what it was like for
men like you and me.

40:16.000 --> 40:17.500
He set me up
for a fall.

40:17.583 --> 40:20.208
Made you promises
he couldn't keep.

40:20.291 --> 40:23.542
"Out front, a bright
green
yard and an apple
tree."

40:23.625 --> 40:25.417
"A neighborhood of good men
and their families."

40:25.500 --> 40:27.083
I just wanted
what was fair.

40:27.166 --> 40:30.000
What every other qualified vet
was getting when they came home.

40:31.709 --> 40:34.125
"A piece of
the American dream."

40:36.875 --> 40:38.750
Alright, I know it
doesn't look like much

40:38.834 --> 40:41.000
but Phase 5 is going to be
our best project yet.

40:41.083 --> 40:42.500
I brought the sketches
for you.

40:42.583 --> 40:44.041
We're going to put
a kidney-shaped pool right--

40:44.125 --> 40:46.542
What the hell's the
matter
with you, huh?

40:46.625 --> 40:49.375
- Your bank rejected me!
- What do you mean?

40:49.458 --> 40:51.083
I personally approved
your application.

40:51.166 --> 40:52.834
My wife got
herself
a new dress.

40:52.917 --> 40:54.417
Wanted to look
her best.

40:54.500 --> 40:55.917
Bank manager takes
one look at us

40:56.000 --> 40:58.083
then starts talking
about some clerical
error!

40:58.166 --> 41:00.542
Just calm down, George,
I will call him myself

41:00.625 --> 41:01.792
and I will straighten
this out.

41:01.875 --> 41:03.792
She cried..

41:03.875 --> 41:05.959
...all the way home.

41:06.041 --> 41:08.667
Nothing I could say
made
a bit of difference.

41:08.750 --> 41:11.917
I let my family
down
because of you!

41:12.000 --> 41:14.500
The policies are wrong.

41:14.583 --> 41:17.500
No matter how
hard I work

41:17.583 --> 41:21.625
I can't make my life look
like
it looks in one of your
ads.

41:23.625 --> 41:26.917
If I got to lend you
the money myself, I will.

41:27.000 --> 41:29.208
You think I want
your charity,
huh?

41:29.291 --> 41:32.875
I got my own down payment
and the monthly.

41:32.959 --> 41:35.041
- I just can't get a break.
- I understand.

41:35.125 --> 41:37.291
You have no idea what
I'm talking about!

41:37.375 --> 41:40.792
I caught more than my share of
hell for the color of my skin.

41:40.875 --> 41:42.166
Most of it from
my own people.

41:42.250 --> 41:44.041
What, you blaming
us now, huh?

41:44.125 --> 41:45.417
'Cause we can't snap our
fingers, skip to the head

41:45.500 --> 41:46.917
of the line like you did?

41:47.000 --> 41:50.583
There's not a day that I have
not regretted that decision.

41:50.667 --> 41:54.208
- This is my fight, too.
- How dare you?! Huh?

41:54.291 --> 41:56.917
Running around,
pretending
to be a white man

41:57.000 --> 41:59.542
and now you want
to be my brother?

42:02.542 --> 42:04.333
What you are
is a
disgrace.

43:57.792 --> 43:59.125
