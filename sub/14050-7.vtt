WEBVTT

00:41.000 --> 00:42.760
You all don't know how lucky you are, you know.

00:42.800 --> 00:45.280
Solly hasn't stepped foot on stage

00:42.800 --> 00:45.280
for 10 years.

00:45.760 --> 00:47.040
Amazing!

00:47.080 --> 00:49.520
Where's the Chief? I don't want him to miss this.

00:49.560 --> 00:51.920
-He said he had to get some air.

01:03.600 --> 01:04.800
You're going to miss the show.

01:04.840 --> 01:06.240
Yeah, wouldn't that be terrible?

01:12.480 --> 01:15.200
You know, they say that a man who doesn't love music

01:15.240 --> 01:16.400
doesn't love life.

01:18.760 --> 01:20.800
-They took my money. -Oh, come on.

01:20.840 --> 01:22.920
Dwayne will have a coronary if you miss this.

01:25.680 --> 01:28.080
Think of it as a team-building exercise.

01:39.800 --> 01:41.520
Richard, come on!

01:49.160 --> 01:51.320
Ah, Chief, you're just in time.

01:51.360 --> 01:52.520
Well, this is fun.

01:53.360 --> 01:54.800
Don't spoil it.

02:04.440 --> 02:06.240
Look, there he comes!

02:34.840 --> 02:36.160
Any minute now.

02:36.200 --> 02:38.200
Sorry, what is it we're waiting for?

02:38.240 --> 02:41.360
The singer, Solly, bursts out from the coffin.

02:41.400 --> 02:44.400
-It's showbusiness.

02:57.640 --> 02:59.440
<i>Ladies and gentlemen.</i>

03:01.320 --> 03:04.000
<i>The one, the only...</i>

03:05.200 --> 03:06.560
<i>-Solomon...</i> -Any minute now.

03:06.600 --> 03:07.840
<i>Solly!</i>

03:22.760 --> 03:26.200
It's a trick. Just wait and see.

03:27.680 --> 03:29.600
It has to be.

03:29.640 --> 03:32.040
I thought you said it was showbusiness.

03:36.400 --> 03:38.360
Okay, Honore Police. Move back.

03:38.400 --> 03:39.760
Thank you. Thank you. Move back.

04:23.400 --> 04:27.000
Convenient, really, having your

04:23.400 --> 04:27.000
own coffin ready and waiting.

04:27.040 --> 04:30.120
Blood grouping shows he was definitely killed inside it,

04:30.160 --> 04:31.600
close-range gunshot wound. We should have

04:31.640 --> 04:33.080
the area searched,

04:33.120 --> 04:35.000
see if anyone discarded the murder weapon anywhere.

04:35.040 --> 04:37.200
-Well, no, no.

04:37.240 --> 04:38.920
That would be highly unlikely.

04:42.720 --> 04:45.720
Or not. Have Dwayne run it for prints.

04:52.960 --> 04:54.480
Obviously didn't work, then.

04:58.640 --> 05:00.960
It's, um...

05:01.000 --> 05:03.640
strange the way he's been laid out, isn't it?

05:01.000 --> 05:03.640
With his arms folded.

05:04.280 --> 05:07.760
At rest, in repose.

05:07.800 --> 05:10.880
You don't do that unless you have

05:07.800 --> 05:10.880
a connection with someone.

05:10.920 --> 05:13.720
Whoever did this must have known him,

05:13.760 --> 05:16.400
cared about him, maybe even loved him.

05:18.480 --> 05:19.960
They've got a funny way of showing it.

05:22.480 --> 05:25.000
I've been waiting for this day for 10 years.

05:25.040 --> 05:27.040
For Solly to die?

05:27.080 --> 05:30.480
No, no. For the band to

05:27.080 --> 05:30.480
get back together.

05:30.520 --> 05:33.680
I played with other groups since the split

05:33.720 --> 05:37.480
but when Curtis, Eddie and Solly was out there,

05:37.520 --> 05:39.800
whoo! It was magical.

05:39.840 --> 05:42.040
Why did the band break up the first time?

05:42.080 --> 05:44.480
-I don't know. -You must have some idea.

05:44.520 --> 05:47.880
No, I just hit the keys, I avoid all that stuff.

05:47.920 --> 05:50.760
Couple of months back, Eddie, the bass player,

05:50.800 --> 05:54.320
called me up and said Solly had finally agreed to

05:50.800 --> 05:54.320
do some new shows.

05:54.360 --> 05:56.040
Some shows?

05:56.080 --> 05:57.480
So, this wasn't just a one

05:57.520 --> 05:59.640
Eddie had big plans for us.

05:59.680 --> 06:02.960
Back in the studio. Back on the road.

06:04.400 --> 06:06.280
Would have been fun.

06:06.320 --> 06:08.800
When was the last time you saw Solly?

06:08.840 --> 06:12.280
Backstage, just when we went to get ready.

06:12.320 --> 06:15.120
Just make sure you boys can keep up with me, okay?

06:19.680 --> 06:20.840
Explain the coffin to me.

06:21.560 --> 06:23.600
Solly's thing.

06:23.640 --> 06:27.040
Fifteen minutes before the show, he goes out and

06:23.640 --> 06:27.040
gets into the coffin,

06:27.080 --> 06:30.360
pulls the lid and waits there to be taken onto stage.

06:30.400 --> 06:32.720
And he went in there alone?

06:32.760 --> 06:36.560
Nobody was allowed. Solly was very

06:32.760 --> 06:36.560
strict about it.

06:36.600 --> 06:39.080
You could set your watch to it,

06:36.600 --> 06:39.080
15 minutes.

06:41.040 --> 06:42.560
Some things never change, I guess.

06:42.600 --> 06:46.560
Fifteen minutes, fellas. He'll be getting

06:42.600 --> 06:46.560
in there right now.

06:46.600 --> 06:51.360
<i>We were all</i> <i>backstage together,</i>

06:46.600 --> 06:51.360
<i>Solly away on his own.</i>

06:51.400 --> 06:55.320
<i>The rest of us finally</i> <i>able to relax</i>

06:51.400 --> 06:55.320
<i>and have some fun.</i>

06:55.360 --> 06:59.240
You see, when we first started out,

06:55.360 --> 06:59.240
we were good, we were solid.

06:59.280 --> 07:00.880
But nobody came to see us.

07:00.920 --> 07:03.000
We were just another band. We didn't stand out.

07:03.040 --> 07:05.280
So, you came up with the coffin as a stage gimmick?

07:05.320 --> 07:06.560
Solly did.

07:06.600 --> 07:08.240
You can say what you like about the guy,

07:08.280 --> 07:10.680
but he was a genius when it came to

07:08.280 --> 07:10.680
that side of things.

07:10.720 --> 07:12.640
Played out the whole mystical angle.

07:12.680 --> 07:14.600
Telling the press that he slept in it,

07:14.640 --> 07:16.960
that that's where he got his voodoo force.

07:17.000 --> 07:19.680
<i>It had been 10 years</i> <i>since we were out on stage.</i>

07:19.720 --> 07:23.320
<i>So, I guess he needed his time</i> <i>now more than ever,</i>

07:23.360 --> 07:26.440
<i>to get into character,</i>

07:26.480 --> 07:28.480
<i>to do the things</i> <i>the way he always did.</i>

07:31.760 --> 07:35.280
I didn't believe a word of it. Not then, not now.

07:36.560 --> 07:38.680
The coffin, the whole 15 minutes alone.

07:38.720 --> 07:40.440
-He didn't need it.

07:40.480 --> 07:42.720
I think he just wanted to make sure

07:40.480 --> 07:42.720
that we knew he was the boss,

07:42.760 --> 07:45.240
he was better than the rest of us.

07:45.280 --> 07:50.480
So, there was some resentment in the band towards him?

07:50.520 --> 07:54.160
We spent years working hard to sell records,

07:54.200 --> 07:56.320
to make him famous.

07:56.360 --> 07:59.400
But the more popular we got, the more Solly got distracted.

07:59.440 --> 08:01.560
The drinks, the party, the women.

08:01.600 --> 08:03.920
Threw away his career, all our careers.

08:03.960 --> 08:06.280
So, yeah, you can say there was some kind

08:03.960 --> 08:06.280
of resentment, yes.

08:06.320 --> 08:08.600
Sorry, do you think you can put that

08:06.320 --> 08:08.600
thing elsewhere

08:08.640 --> 08:11.160
while we talk to you?

08:11.200 --> 08:14.800
-It's just a little distracting.

08:11.200 --> 08:14.800
-I am an ophiophilist.

08:14.840 --> 08:20.320
It means I am fond of snakes. Smart creatures, very loyal.

08:20.360 --> 08:22.000
-Even so. -You rather I just

08:20.360 --> 08:22.000
let her roam free?

08:22.040 --> 08:24.440
Whoa! It's fine, it's fine, it's fine.

08:24.480 --> 08:28.920
So, quarter to nine, Solly goes to his coffin to

08:24.480 --> 08:28.920
prepare for the show.

08:28.960 --> 08:30.320
Where were you?

08:30.360 --> 08:33.560
With the rest of them, backstage,

08:30.360 --> 08:33.560
ready to go on.

08:33.600 --> 08:38.040
<i>I wasn't sure</i> <i>about the comeback.</i>

08:33.600 --> 08:38.040
<i>Old wounds.</i>

08:38.080 --> 08:42.880
<i>But there's no denying it,</i> <i>building up to</i>

08:38.080 --> 08:42.880
<i>that 9:00 show time,</i>

08:42.920 --> 08:46.880
<i>boy, it felt good to be back.</i>

08:46.920 --> 08:51.200
When the band start playing their first number,

08:51.240 --> 08:54.360
it's your job to make sure the coffin appears on stage.

08:54.400 --> 08:57.880
Two minutes into the music, I go backstage

08:54.400 --> 08:57.880
to get the coffin.

08:59.920 --> 09:01.280
Ready, Solly?

09:01.320 --> 09:03.920
Didn't know anything was wrong till I opened it up.

09:03.960 --> 09:05.880
So, you're the only one who had access to Solly.

09:05.920 --> 09:07.720
Officially, yes.

09:07.760 --> 09:12.000
And where were you during the 15 minutes

09:07.760 --> 09:12.000
of his alone time?

09:12.040 --> 09:13.840
Well, I was onstage, checking out the equipment.

09:13.880 --> 09:15.480
You can ask anyone at the bar.

09:15.520 --> 09:18.080
And as far as you know, nobody went to see

09:15.520 --> 09:18.080
him during that time?

09:18.120 --> 09:20.760
Solly would have torn them off a strip.

09:20.800 --> 09:22.560
But Solly being Solly,

09:22.600 --> 09:25.960
there could always be exceptions

09:22.600 --> 09:25.960
to the rules, like that girl.

09:26.000 --> 09:28.400
-I didn't know her name.

09:28.440 --> 09:32.120
She's been around for a week or so,

09:28.440 --> 09:32.120
said she was a photographer.

09:32.160 --> 09:36.400
<i>Pretty little thing,</i> <i>early 20s. Solly was</i>

09:32.160 --> 09:36.400
<i>obviously very fond of her</i>

09:36.440 --> 09:38.120
<i>because he didn't</i> <i>shout and scream</i>

09:36.440 --> 09:38.120
<i>around her</i>

09:38.160 --> 09:40.400
<i>like he did at everybody else.</i>

09:40.440 --> 09:43.160
She even stopped by to see him earlier this evening.

09:43.200 --> 09:46.200
Right. Do you remember what shoes she was wearing?

09:46.240 --> 09:48.680
Any distinctive features?

09:48.720 --> 09:54.160
You know, plain shoes or something

09:48.720 --> 09:54.160
a little more ostentatious?

09:54.200 --> 09:59.160
Quite a pronounced heel, maybe blue

09:54.200 --> 09:59.160
flowers on the front?

09:59.200 --> 10:02.000
I didn't realise you were so interested

09:59.200 --> 10:02.000
in women's fashion.

10:02.040 --> 10:04.960
I'm not. I'm simply trying to establish what kind of

10:02.040 --> 10:04.960
shoes she was wearing.

10:05.000 --> 10:06.520
Hmm. I see.

10:06.560 --> 10:08.320
NEVILLE: Shoes are shoes, man.

10:08.360 --> 10:11.560
And with a smile like that, wouldn't you

10:08.360 --> 10:11.560
focus on her face?

10:11.600 --> 10:13.720
That couldn't have been easy for his wife,

10:13.760 --> 10:16.400
Solly running around with a younger girl.

10:16.440 --> 10:20.160
Nothing Solly ever did was easy on other folk.

10:20.200 --> 10:22.480
So, you're seriously telling me

10:20.200 --> 10:22.480
you weren't jealous of him

10:22.520 --> 10:25.760
spending time with a younger, prettier woman?

10:25.800 --> 10:28.120
Which is what I would be asking

10:25.800 --> 10:28.120
Avita Jackson,

10:28.160 --> 10:31.320
if you hadn't let her leave!

10:31.360 --> 10:33.480
Sir, she was crying. She had just lost her husband.

10:33.520 --> 10:36.200
No, no, no, she hadn't lost him,

10:33.520 --> 10:36.200
he was murdered.

10:36.240 --> 10:38.520
Which is all the more reason to keep her here.

10:38.560 --> 10:40.840
Okay, Chief, I screwed up, I know.

10:42.680 --> 10:47.200
Right. Avita, the wife.

10:47.240 --> 10:49.840
Eddie, bass player, architect of the comeback.

10:49.880 --> 10:51.360
Curtis the guitarist,

10:51.400 --> 10:53.160
Renward the keyboard player

10:53.200 --> 10:55.520
and Neville the roadie.

10:55.560 --> 10:57.680
Each one has an alibi for the time of the murder.

11:09.200 --> 11:10.320
Two questions.

11:10.360 --> 11:13.520
Who was the mystery lady with pretty shoes?

11:14.240 --> 11:16.680
Yes, but also...

11:19.080 --> 11:20.320
Why a gun?

11:20.360 --> 11:24.400
-There are better ways, quieter.

11:20.360 --> 11:24.400
-Exactly.

11:24.440 --> 11:28.560
-Ah! Just what we need.

11:29.400 --> 11:31.240
On the table, please.

11:34.240 --> 11:35.840
Seen this?

11:35.880 --> 11:40.800
Mmm-hmm. A woman with impressively

11:35.880 --> 11:40.800
large breasts.

11:40.840 --> 11:43.440
No, here, look. A pendant round his neck.

11:43.480 --> 11:47.840
Oh, so the killer took it off and placed it in his hands.

11:47.880 --> 11:49.920
Okay, great. Why?

11:51.480 --> 11:53.160
I don't know.

11:54.040 --> 11:55.400
DWAYNE: Um, good to go, Chief.

11:57.240 --> 11:58.920
Do you want me to clear some space

11:58.960 --> 12:01.200
in case you get the urge to kick off your

11:58.960 --> 12:01.200
shoes and dance?

12:01.240 --> 12:03.760
It is important that we profile

12:01.240 --> 12:03.760
the victim.

12:03.800 --> 12:06.160
Family, friends, colleagues.

12:06.200 --> 12:08.680
In Solly's case, we have the added benefit

12:08.720 --> 12:12.640
of being able to learn about him from his own words,

12:08.720 --> 12:12.640
his own songs.

12:12.680 --> 12:16.360
Understand the man and you'll

12:12.680 --> 12:16.360
understand the murder.

12:26.520 --> 12:28.200
On second thoughts, Dwayne,

12:26.520 --> 12:28.200
perhaps it would be better

12:28.240 --> 12:30.600
if you listened through it and transcribed the lyrics for me.

12:30.640 --> 12:32.800
No need.

12:32.840 --> 12:36.600
Solly sang about two things, monsters and women.

12:36.640 --> 12:38.320
Well, there were some pretty

12:36.640 --> 12:38.320
weird-looking individuals

12:38.360 --> 12:39.880
at that show of his,

12:39.920 --> 12:42.760
but I think we can rule out any of them

12:39.920 --> 12:42.760
being actual zombies.

12:42.800 --> 12:44.480
So, what did he say about women?

12:44.520 --> 12:46.360
Solly sang about being a bit of a playboy.

12:46.400 --> 12:49.080
You know, man the hunter, women the prey.

12:49.120 --> 12:52.200
Every girl a flower waiting to be plucked,

12:52.240 --> 12:54.400
an uncharted map to be explored.

12:54.440 --> 12:56.000
Yeah, we get the picture.

12:56.040 --> 12:58.120
Although, strictly speaking,

12:58.160 --> 13:00.320
there's no such thing as an uncharted map.

13:00.360 --> 13:03.840
The whole point of cartography is to illuminate the unknown.

13:03.880 --> 13:08.240
-It's poetry. -You have no

13:03.880 --> 13:08.240
romance in your soul.

13:08.280 --> 13:13.520
Either way, I think we can safely say Solly had an eye

13:08.280 --> 13:13.520
for the fairer sex.

13:13.560 --> 13:17.680
Oh, Solly had his fun, all right.

13:13.560 --> 13:17.680
All over town.

13:17.720 --> 13:19.240
Despite being married.

13:19.280 --> 13:20.680
For 20 years.

13:20.720 --> 13:22.320
And seeing as certain members of the service

13:22.360 --> 13:25.600
saw fit to let her slip away yesterday,

13:25.640 --> 13:28.720
perhaps now we should see what the wife has

13:25.640 --> 13:28.720
to say for herself.

13:33.680 --> 13:35.560
RICHARD: Mrs Jackson?

13:36.600 --> 13:37.960
Mrs Jackson?

13:39.200 --> 13:40.920
Sorry for disturbing you.

13:43.400 --> 13:47.400
You, uh, thinking of leaving?

13:47.440 --> 13:50.320
-I'm Detective Inspector... -I know who you are.

13:50.360 --> 13:52.320
I understand this is

13:50.360 --> 13:52.320
a difficult time for you...

13:52.360 --> 13:54.080
Would you mind if I saw your shoes?

13:54.120 --> 13:55.560
Yes.

13:55.600 --> 13:58.640
-Won't take a second. -They are on my feet.

13:58.680 --> 14:00.560
And there's another pair by the door.

14:04.000 --> 14:05.680
Thank you.

14:05.720 --> 14:07.880
Is there a another item of clothing

14:05.720 --> 14:07.880
you'd like to see?

14:09.440 --> 14:10.560
No.

14:10.600 --> 14:13.320
No, although I do notice

14:13.360 --> 14:16.200
you're throwing away those that belonged to your husband.

14:16.240 --> 14:18.440
There's no reason for me to hang on to them now.

14:20.840 --> 14:22.360
You don't seem very upset.

14:22.400 --> 14:24.840
Would you rather I was weeping and wailing on your shoulder?

14:26.000 --> 14:28.280
Am I sorry he's gone? Yes.

14:28.320 --> 14:31.840
Do I miss him? I don't know yet.

14:31.880 --> 14:35.120
Am I going to sit here and dwell on it?

14:35.160 --> 14:37.680
I have too much to do before I go back to St Lucia.

14:37.720 --> 14:42.040
Solly's wake to organise and grief isn't

14:37.720 --> 14:42.040
going to help that.

14:42.080 --> 14:46.120
-At the time of his death... -I was backstage,

14:46.160 --> 14:50.120
watching his bandmates act like

14:46.160 --> 14:50.120
the little kids they are.

14:50.160 --> 14:53.280
Do you know of anyone that might have

14:50.160 --> 14:53.280
wanted him dead?

14:53.320 --> 14:57.040
I know people who didn't like him,

14:53.320 --> 14:57.040
but to kill him?

14:57.080 --> 14:59.920
We suspect the murderer might be someone he knew,

14:59.960 --> 15:01.840
someone close to him.

15:01.880 --> 15:04.480
Are there any brothers, sisters, children?

15:04.520 --> 15:06.640
Solly was an only child.

15:06.680 --> 15:09.480
And as for having little ones...

15:09.520 --> 15:14.480
I thought about it, cried about it,

15:09.520 --> 15:14.480
but he wasn't interested.

15:14.520 --> 15:19.320
Although the other day, the man looks

15:14.520 --> 15:19.320
round at me and says,

15:19.360 --> 15:22.800
"It wouldn't have been the end of the world."

15:22.840 --> 15:26.280
That was Solly. Just when you think

15:22.840 --> 15:26.280
you've figured him out,

15:26.320 --> 15:29.640
he'll find a new way to mess with your mind.

15:29.680 --> 15:34.920
This pendant he wore, did it have any particular

15:29.680 --> 15:34.920
significance for him?

15:34.960 --> 15:37.800
Just voodoo tat, it's probably worthless.

15:37.840 --> 15:42.200
Scrape away the obi makeup, the costumes,

15:37.840 --> 15:42.200
the whole silly act,

15:42.240 --> 15:45.880
when he started singing, he could break your heart,

15:45.920 --> 15:48.520
if he wanted to.

15:48.560 --> 15:51.240
I'm sure he got a lot of attention.

15:51.280 --> 15:54.960
Certainly, his music paints him

15:51.280 --> 15:54.960
as something of a womaniser.

15:55.000 --> 15:57.360
Solly was a go out, stay out sort of man.

15:57.400 --> 15:59.760
If he came home before sunrise,

15:57.400 --> 15:59.760
I never saw it.

15:59.800 --> 16:01.840
And what he did when he was out there,

16:01.880 --> 16:04.600
I never asked, I never wanted to know.

16:06.040 --> 16:08.200
There was a girl seen hanging around this past week.

16:08.240 --> 16:09.560
Do you know her?

16:10.200 --> 16:11.360
I saw her.

16:11.400 --> 16:13.840
Okay, let's give Solly his space.

16:13.880 --> 16:15.320
Come on. Let's do this.

16:15.360 --> 16:16.680
GIRL: Smile.

16:18.760 --> 16:20.400
Do you think he was having an affair with her?

16:20.440 --> 16:22.200
Do you think I want to answer these questions?

16:22.240 --> 16:23.600
-Sir... -I'm sorry, I know it's hard

16:23.640 --> 16:25.760
but I have to ask.

16:26.440 --> 16:27.720
I don't know.

16:27.760 --> 16:31.040
Nevertheless, the prospect of a comeback,

16:31.080 --> 16:33.000
many more shows, many more crowds,

16:33.040 --> 16:34.560
many more women.

16:34.600 --> 16:36.640
The thought of that must have made you very unhappy.

16:36.680 --> 16:39.120
Unhappy enough to kill him, is what you mean.

16:39.160 --> 16:41.680
I'm simply trying to establish your state of mind at

16:39.160 --> 16:41.680
the time of the murder.

16:41.720 --> 16:44.560
Oh, is that what you're trying to do?

16:44.600 --> 16:46.240
You should watch your tone with the lady.

16:48.400 --> 16:49.960
Avita.

16:55.680 --> 16:58.400
This is a murder investigation,

16:55.680 --> 16:58.400
we have to follow all leads.

16:58.440 --> 17:00.680
Her husband died yesterday.

17:03.440 --> 17:06.440
She was with the rest of us when Solly got...

17:07.880 --> 17:09.440
When he passed away.

17:09.480 --> 17:12.120
We were all together, no matter how many

17:09.480 --> 17:12.120
questions you ask.

17:13.760 --> 17:15.160
I am so sorry.

17:35.440 --> 17:37.200
What?

17:37.240 --> 17:40.080
We think Solly was killed by someone

17:37.240 --> 17:40.080
close to him, right?

17:40.120 --> 17:42.360
And yet, everyone close to him has an alibi.

17:42.400 --> 17:46.200
The gun in the coffin, the body in the pose,

17:46.240 --> 17:47.720
the pendant in the hand.

17:47.760 --> 17:50.200
There's got to be a reason behind all these things.

17:50.240 --> 17:52.880
Which is?

17:52.920 --> 17:55.120
Well, I don't know, I'm just saying.

17:55.160 --> 17:59.360
-Oh, I thought you had something.

17:55.160 --> 17:59.360
-No.

17:59.400 --> 18:01.280
Oh, never mind.

18:40.240 --> 18:41.680
Ah!

18:45.440 --> 18:47.920
Show me the pendant, the one that was

18:45.440 --> 18:47.920
found in Solly's hands.

18:50.840 --> 18:52.600
-Yes.

18:52.640 --> 18:56.920
See, just like these ones, right?

18:52.640 --> 18:56.920
In the early albums.

18:56.960 --> 19:02.400
Then in the last few, early-to-mid-'90s,

18:56.960 --> 19:02.400
he switched, look, to silver.

19:02.440 --> 19:06.200
-Yes, but when he was killed...

19:02.440 --> 19:06.200
-Back to gold again.

19:06.240 --> 19:09.000
-It's got to be significant. -Bad news.

19:09.040 --> 19:11.160
Tried tracing the gun, came up with nothing.

19:11.200 --> 19:14.160
No serial number, no leads. Sorry, Chief.

19:14.200 --> 19:17.160
And what about our mystery girl,

19:14.200 --> 19:17.160
anything on her?

19:17.200 --> 19:19.360
-Sorry, Chief. -Yeah, great.

19:19.400 --> 19:22.560
Well, keep hitting the street, asking people.

19:22.600 --> 19:24.480
It's not as if she's just going to

19:22.600 --> 19:24.480
walk in here and say...

19:24.520 --> 19:25.760
WOMAN: Hello!

19:27.880 --> 19:31.480
-I'm Michelle Bouchant.

19:31.520 --> 19:33.760
I hear you've been looking for me.

19:33.800 --> 19:35.240
RICHARD: Yes.

19:36.280 --> 19:38.760
I'm Detective Inspector Richard Poole.

19:38.800 --> 19:41.320
-You have nice shoes. -Thank you.

19:42.160 --> 19:43.800
Very nice, distinctive.

19:44.960 --> 19:47.480
So, you met with Solly a few times.

19:47.520 --> 19:49.920
I was doing a photo assignment on him.

19:49.960 --> 19:51.680
For a newspaper or a magazine?

19:51.720 --> 19:53.360
Freelance.

19:53.400 --> 19:54.680
You're not local?

19:54.720 --> 19:59.080
No. Well, sort of, my mother was.

19:59.120 --> 20:01.040
We moved away when I was young.

20:01.080 --> 20:04.120
And where were you before the show started last night?

20:04.160 --> 20:07.880
I was just at the venue, waiting for it to kick off.

20:07.920 --> 20:09.960
RICHARD: Didn't leave at all?

20:10.000 --> 20:11.160
No.

20:11.720 --> 20:14.040
May I?

20:22.640 --> 20:25.120
There was obviously more between you and Solly than

20:22.640 --> 20:25.120
a photo assignment.

20:34.120 --> 20:35.680
Thank you.

20:40.840 --> 20:42.280
Too pretty.

20:45.320 --> 20:47.400
So, you weren't at the venue when the band came on stage.

20:47.440 --> 20:48.760
No.

20:48.800 --> 20:50.400
Sorry, that wasn't a question, it was a statement.

20:50.440 --> 20:53.160
See, I know you weren't. You were outside, crying. Why?

20:55.560 --> 20:57.040
Sorry, you know the why part,

20:57.080 --> 20:58.880
that means it's a question I'd like you to answer.

20:58.920 --> 21:02.040
I was just stressed.

21:02.080 --> 21:04.080
Hmm Because of what, work?

21:04.120 --> 21:05.320
Yes.

21:05.360 --> 21:08.160
Of course, yeah, your photo assignment.

21:08.200 --> 21:10.080
You can see for yourself.

21:15.080 --> 21:16.880
RICHARD: Not bad.

21:16.920 --> 21:18.440
You have a decent eye.

21:18.480 --> 21:20.480
You also have a silver pendant that Solly wore round his neck

21:20.520 --> 21:22.360
up until his death.

21:22.400 --> 21:25.760
So, if you have his pendant, you must have been

21:22.400 --> 21:25.760
very close with him.

21:25.800 --> 21:28.040
No, I only met him last week.

21:28.080 --> 21:30.880
-Yes.

21:30.920 --> 21:32.600
Same year the album covers show the pendant

21:32.640 --> 21:34.000
changing from gold to silver.

21:35.040 --> 21:36.600
He gave the gold one away, didn't he?

21:37.400 --> 21:38.800
To your mother.

21:40.000 --> 21:41.560
Yes.

21:41.600 --> 21:42.960
Solly was your father.

21:46.280 --> 21:48.960
One for him and one for her.

21:50.520 --> 21:51.960
They had swapped.

21:52.000 --> 21:54.280
He gave her the gold pendant, he kept the silver one

21:54.320 --> 21:56.480
and you switched them back when you killed him.

21:56.520 --> 21:57.600
What?

21:58.360 --> 21:59.600
No, I didn't. Didn't switch them

21:59.640 --> 22:00.880
or didn't kill him?

22:00.920 --> 22:02.400
I... I didn't kill him.

22:02.440 --> 22:04.760
Then why switch the pendants?

22:04.800 --> 22:07.800
It seemed only right.

22:09.840 --> 22:14.360
To give him back the one that she had kept for so long.

22:15.480 --> 22:16.840
So, you admit to being there?

22:19.520 --> 22:23.720
I went to wish him luck before he went out there.

22:25.760 --> 22:29.320
He was so excited about doing another show.

22:29.360 --> 22:32.400
Two months back, I didn't know

22:29.360 --> 22:32.400
anything about my father.

22:32.440 --> 22:34.920
Name, face, nothing.

22:35.880 --> 22:40.040
Then my mother, she gets sick.

22:42.560 --> 22:43.840
She died.

22:44.800 --> 22:46.360
Twelve days ago.

22:48.160 --> 22:51.000
I came here because I didn't know

22:48.160 --> 22:51.000
where else to go.

22:51.040 --> 22:52.800
I thought I had no other family.

22:53.880 --> 22:55.320
Did he mention any one at all?

22:55.360 --> 22:57.480
Anyone who might have had a motive to kill him?

22:57.520 --> 22:59.680
He wasn't killed.

22:59.720 --> 23:01.360
That's what hurt the most.

23:02.280 --> 23:04.240
I just found him.

23:05.400 --> 23:07.760
And he said it made him feel complete.

23:10.240 --> 23:12.800
And then for him to take his own life.

23:16.560 --> 23:18.480
<i>I knew he'd be worried</i> <i>about the comeback,</i>

23:18.520 --> 23:20.960
<i>about whether he could still</i> <i>wow the crowds.</i>

23:22.200 --> 23:24.720
<i>But I never</i> <i>thought he'd do this.</i>

23:24.760 --> 23:26.160
Solly, no.

23:26.200 --> 23:27.440
<i>I should have run.</i>

23:27.480 --> 23:30.960
<i>I should have got help,</i> <i>but I didn't.</i>

23:31.000 --> 23:35.760
I couldn't let them find him, not like that.

23:35.800 --> 23:37.560
<i>Solly had said to me that</i> <i>when he went out,</i>

23:37.600 --> 23:39.760
<i>he wanted to be</i> <i>doing what he loved,</i>

23:39.800 --> 23:42.720
<i>out there, onstage.</i>

23:42.760 --> 23:46.160
<i>I just watched my</i> <i>mother pass away</i>

23:42.760 --> 23:46.160
<i>in some anonymous hospital,</i>

23:46.200 --> 23:49.400
<i>surrounded by</i> <i>people she didn't know.</i>

23:49.440 --> 23:51.480
I wasn't going to let that happen

23:49.440 --> 23:51.480
to my father.

23:52.640 --> 23:54.720
<i>As wrong as it was...</i>

23:55.720 --> 23:58.080
<i>it was also right.</i>

23:59.600 --> 24:02.640
<i>Out there, onstage.</i>

24:03.920 --> 24:05.480
<i>One last show.</i>

24:09.640 --> 24:13.080
The gun, the arms folded, the pendant.

24:13.120 --> 24:14.320
All accounted for.

24:17.040 --> 24:20.200
Uh, we'll need to keep the camera.

24:20.240 --> 24:22.440
The photographs are potential evidence.

24:23.640 --> 24:25.400
And the pendant.

24:33.040 --> 24:34.520
I just don't believe it.

24:34.560 --> 24:36.640
Chief, all the evidence.

24:36.680 --> 24:40.000
Not to mention everyone close to him,

24:36.680 --> 24:40.000
everyone who loved him,

24:40.040 --> 24:41.680
has a cast-iron alibi.

24:41.720 --> 24:43.520
Something's not right.

24:46.040 --> 24:48.000
Hello?

24:48.040 --> 24:50.800
Oh, thank you. Thank you very much.

24:54.560 --> 24:56.520
No, only Solly's.

24:58.960 --> 25:01.000
CAMILLE: I know you're disappointed.

25:01.040 --> 25:03.440
His little mystery's solved already.

25:06.920 --> 25:10.080
Have they run a gunshot residue analysis on

25:06.920 --> 25:10.080
Solly's hand and clothes yet?

25:10.120 --> 25:11.440
No.

25:11.480 --> 25:13.040
Make sure they do it.

25:13.080 --> 25:15.080
Holding a gun is not as same as firing it.

25:18.480 --> 25:21.960
As far as I'm concerned, this case isn't closed yet.

25:22.000 --> 25:24.200
Work to be done.

25:24.240 --> 25:27.040
I don't suppose you could put that in some sort of...

25:27.080 --> 25:29.040
Never mind.

25:29.080 --> 25:30.320
Come on.

25:39.240 --> 25:41.000
Yeah. I could sing.

25:41.800 --> 25:43.520
Since when last did you sing?

25:44.080 --> 25:45.200
In the shower.

25:52.000 --> 25:53.560
Just...

25:53.600 --> 25:54.600
Solly gets offed

25:55.320 --> 25:57.080
and then there's you,

25:57.120 --> 25:59.360
all of a sudden wanting to be lead man.

26:01.360 --> 26:03.320
No. -Him not saying nothing.

26:05.320 --> 26:07.480
I want to know what Eddie means.

26:07.520 --> 26:11.000
Hmm? Are you suggesting I had anything

26:07.520 --> 26:11.000
to do with Solly's death?

26:15.760 --> 26:17.720
-Thanks. -Good night.

26:24.360 --> 26:26.960
-Hi.

26:27.000 --> 26:29.640
They tell me this is the best place

26:27.000 --> 26:29.640
in town to get a drink.

26:29.680 --> 26:31.680
They tell the truth.

26:31.720 --> 26:33.640
Might I recommend the planter's punch?

26:36.000 --> 26:38.080
That's the most expensive drink on here.

26:38.120 --> 26:41.640
Oh, really? I hadn't noticed.

26:41.680 --> 26:43.600
I almost wished I never met him.

26:44.440 --> 26:45.960
Did he upset you?

26:46.000 --> 26:48.120
He hurt my mother a lot. And...

26:48.160 --> 26:52.000
-I guess I was looking forward to...

26:52.040 --> 26:53.160
No.

26:54.440 --> 26:55.760
Just...

26:57.200 --> 26:59.880
making sure he understood what he'd done.

26:59.920 --> 27:01.440
It doesn't matter now, does it?

27:01.480 --> 27:02.920
Ah.

27:02.960 --> 27:06.560
Not going to happen. It's over.

27:07.480 --> 27:08.960
Not quite over.

27:09.000 --> 27:11.600
The investigation is still open.

27:11.640 --> 27:13.720
We are not quite convinced it was suicide.

27:14.400 --> 27:17.480
But if it wasn't...

27:17.520 --> 27:19.400
Do you think you'll find out who did it?

27:19.440 --> 27:21.480
We'll do everything we can. And I know DI Poole

27:23.600 --> 27:26.040
won't sleep until he's found out the truth.

28:01.200 --> 28:03.960
I warn you. I'm armed and...

28:05.440 --> 28:07.800
Well, I'm armed.

28:47.960 --> 28:49.800
DWAYNE: Somebody doesn't like you.

28:47.960 --> 28:49.800
RICHARD: Indeed.

28:50.720 --> 28:52.200
An ophiophilist.

28:53.600 --> 28:55.240
Someone who loves snakes.

28:55.280 --> 28:56.880
Try and keep up, Dwayne.

28:56.920 --> 29:00.640
Ah, Curtis the guitarist.

29:00.680 --> 29:03.920
You think it was a warning to stay away,

29:00.680 --> 29:03.920
stop the case?

29:03.960 --> 29:05.400
We'll find out in the morning.

29:12.720 --> 29:14.320
Do you want some company tonight?

29:15.760 --> 29:17.080
In case they come back?

29:18.720 --> 29:20.960
That's very kind but, um...

29:21.000 --> 29:23.840
Just to warn you, I do snore.

29:23.880 --> 29:26.160
Now, I don't mind sleeping on the sofa

29:26.200 --> 29:28.360
but I am told I'm very loud.

29:30.280 --> 29:31.720
I'll be fine.

29:34.960 --> 29:36.320
You sure?

29:41.840 --> 29:43.760
Oh, it was worth it, you know.

29:43.800 --> 29:46.320
Just to see those pyjamas again.

30:04.920 --> 30:07.000
-Of course.

30:07.040 --> 30:09.920
Only, you did seem a little shaken last night.

30:09.960 --> 30:11.960
No, not at all.

30:12.000 --> 30:15.400
It's just an Englishman never likes

30:12.000 --> 30:15.400
to have his sleep disturbed.

30:15.440 --> 30:17.680
I've got something that will make

30:15.440 --> 30:17.680
you feel better.

30:19.000 --> 30:20.600
Gunshot residue report.

30:25.640 --> 30:27.560
No sign of Solly having fired the gun.

30:27.600 --> 30:29.480
-Correct. -I knew it.

30:31.200 --> 30:33.280
Well, I suspected it.

30:33.320 --> 30:36.760
So we can definitely rule out suicide.

30:33.320 --> 30:36.760
Solly's death was murder.

30:36.800 --> 30:38.320
I think we should...

30:41.120 --> 30:46.000
Oh, wow! Very immature. I'll have word

30:41.120 --> 30:46.000
with whoever did that!

30:46.040 --> 30:48.760
There's only you and me here.

30:48.800 --> 30:51.000
Well, I'm sorry, sir. You were saying...

30:51.040 --> 30:53.720
Ask Curtis about his snake.

30:56.480 --> 30:58.880
And why it ended up in my bungalow.

31:01.720 --> 31:03.640
-Yeah.

31:21.160 --> 31:23.840
Ah, well, there is the house of a man

31:21.160 --> 31:23.840
who ran out of money.

31:24.960 --> 31:26.680
Better be careful.

31:26.720 --> 31:28.600
Don't know how he'll react when cornered.

31:35.320 --> 31:36.560
Curtis James?

31:36.600 --> 31:38.720
This is Detective Inspector Richard Poole.

31:40.400 --> 31:42.400
What do you want?

31:44.760 --> 31:46.680
Do you mind if we see your snake

31:44.760 --> 31:46.680
for a moment

31:48.680 --> 31:49.960
Not particularly.

31:52.440 --> 31:54.680
She's been missing all night.

31:54.720 --> 31:56.400
I've been searching for her everywhere.

31:59.240 --> 32:01.560
Sorry about the mess.

32:01.600 --> 32:03.040
Been going crazy

32:04.040 --> 32:05.960
trying to find my girl.

32:08.840 --> 32:10.560
Wait a minute.

32:10.600 --> 32:12.000
How you know she was missing?

32:12.040 --> 32:14.600
Because somebody placed it in my bungalow last night.

32:14.640 --> 32:17.120
You find her

32:17.160 --> 32:19.680
-Yes, but that's not really the point.

32:17.160 --> 32:19.680
-Oh!

32:19.720 --> 32:21.560
-No, no, no. -Oh, thank you!

32:21.600 --> 32:23.600
-Thank you very, very much. -You don't understand.

32:23.640 --> 32:26.840
It was deliberately placed in my home.

32:23.640 --> 32:26.840
A dangerous animal.

32:26.880 --> 32:29.280
Reptile, not animal.

32:29.320 --> 32:31.640
And I have a licence. Somewhere.

32:33.240 --> 32:34.720
You're still failing to understand.

32:34.760 --> 32:37.280
Look, under the circumstances, your animal...

32:37.320 --> 32:40.520
Your reptile was used to threaten a police officer.

32:40.560 --> 32:42.280
What, are you going to arrest me?

32:42.320 --> 32:43.480
But I haven't done anything.

32:43.520 --> 32:46.160
Well, that remains to be seen.

32:46.200 --> 32:48.520
But she's safe, right? My snake.

32:48.560 --> 32:50.040
Definitely okay?

32:51.080 --> 32:52.760
This woman in this photograph.

32:53.800 --> 32:55.040
Is that Avita?

32:56.240 --> 32:57.680
You seem close.

32:58.840 --> 33:00.120
We were.

33:07.040 --> 33:10.360
We better go upstairs where you can get

33:07.040 --> 33:10.360
a little breeze.

33:10.400 --> 33:13.480
You seemed very bitter about Solly

33:10.400 --> 33:13.480
when we spoke to you,

33:13.520 --> 33:15.200
even after you discovered he'd just died.

33:16.240 --> 33:17.880
We were in a band.

33:19.120 --> 33:21.160
Him and me were family.

33:21.200 --> 33:23.320
And it didn't mean I liked him.

33:23.360 --> 33:25.200
Because of how things turned out with Avita?

33:27.960 --> 33:31.000
When I met her, she wanted to be a singer.

33:32.080 --> 33:33.560
I had just joined Solly's band.

33:35.360 --> 33:38.120
She used to do the odd show with us, you know?

33:38.160 --> 33:40.760
Two of them out front, singing away, tearing it up.

33:43.920 --> 33:45.200
I didn't see it coming.

33:46.280 --> 33:47.720
I was blind.

33:47.760 --> 33:49.320
You never got over her.

33:50.080 --> 33:51.920
Have you seen her?

33:51.960 --> 33:54.040
Right. I think we've established

33:51.960 --> 33:54.040
that you like her.

33:54.760 --> 33:57.800
So, in a way,

33:57.840 --> 33:59.240
everything's worked out for you.

33:59.280 --> 34:01.600
All right, let's say I did it.

34:01.640 --> 34:04.520
Say it's me killed him, yeah?

34:04.560 --> 34:06.480
What would you do next if you was me?

34:06.520 --> 34:08.760
Act normal.

34:08.800 --> 34:10.880
Go about my business or be a little sad,

34:10.920 --> 34:12.600
you know, in mourning.

34:12.640 --> 34:15.440
Would you drive to the investigating

34:12.640 --> 34:15.440
officer's house

34:15.480 --> 34:17.360
and put a snake, a snake, you know,

34:17.400 --> 34:20.160
that was clearly tied to you, through his door?

34:20.200 --> 34:22.080
If I was incredibly stupid, I might.

34:22.120 --> 34:24.720
Do I seem incredibly stupid to you,

34:22.120 --> 34:24.720
Detective Inspector?

34:24.760 --> 34:27.320
I don't know you well enough to say for sure.

34:27.360 --> 34:28.960
You might be.

34:29.000 --> 34:30.360
Or maybe you think that someone else did it

34:30.400 --> 34:31.960
and you're trying to throw me off the scent?

34:32.000 --> 34:33.000
Like, uh...

34:34.200 --> 34:35.760
-No.

34:36.880 --> 34:38.000
She didn't do it.

34:38.040 --> 34:39.920
You don't sound 100% sure.

34:39.960 --> 34:41.640
All right, she was a little angry

34:39.960 --> 34:41.640
with Solly, but...

34:41.680 --> 34:44.520
Angry

34:44.560 --> 34:47.200
CAMILLE: Because she found out he had a daughter?

34:48.720 --> 34:50.280
Yes?

34:52.880 --> 34:56.360
-She's a good woman.

34:59.760 --> 35:02.280
No, you weren't, were you?

35:03.040 --> 35:04.400
All those looks.

35:04.440 --> 35:07.560
It's always been from afar, for so long.

35:13.520 --> 35:17.000
Oh, I saw the way she reacted when you came

35:13.520 --> 35:17.000
round to see her.

35:17.840 --> 35:21.920
Like everything was all right.

35:21.960 --> 35:24.360
Yes, as beautiful as this is, you're still

35:21.960 --> 35:24.360
suspected of murder

35:24.400 --> 35:28.080
and of threatening and potentially

35:24.400 --> 35:28.080
harming a police officer.

35:28.120 --> 35:29.400
Stop smiling!

35:33.480 --> 35:35.360
RICHARD: Well, Curtis has motive.

35:35.400 --> 35:37.360
Solly stole his girlfriend.

35:37.400 --> 35:40.960
Never moves on, has to watch his friend

35:37.400 --> 35:40.960
become a big star,

35:41.000 --> 35:44.240
the woman he loves on Solly's arm.

35:44.280 --> 35:47.320
CAMILLE: Well, if only he

35:44.280 --> 35:47.320
didn't have an alibi.

35:47.360 --> 35:49.560
I know.

35:49.600 --> 35:52.440
Those 15 minutes Solly's alone.

35:52.480 --> 35:54.480
I've checked all the witness statements,

35:55.000 --> 35:56.600
the band, Avita,

35:58.080 --> 35:59.360
all together.

35:59.400 --> 36:00.760
Somebody's lying.

36:00.800 --> 36:02.440
Yup, someone is.

36:08.000 --> 36:10.000
You're in love with Curtis.

36:12.640 --> 36:14.520
-What he means to say is...

36:14.560 --> 36:16.120
You love Curtis, he loves you.

36:16.160 --> 36:18.280
Does the fact that I'm recently widowed

36:18.320 --> 36:20.000
not mean anything to you?

36:20.040 --> 36:21.400
So, you're not denying it, then?

36:21.440 --> 36:23.800
You don't think I know where this is going?

36:23.840 --> 36:25.360
Curtis already phoned me

36:25.400 --> 36:27.880
and he told me that he said I knew about Michelle.

36:27.920 --> 36:29.920
A fact you failed to mention to us.

36:29.960 --> 36:34.200
So now you want to know was I upset

36:34.240 --> 36:36.560
Angry enough to kill him?

36:36.600 --> 36:38.800
If you'd be so kind as to indulge me.

36:38.840 --> 36:42.680
Yes, yes, no.

36:48.920 --> 36:50.240
Did you still love Solly?

36:51.800 --> 36:53.720
I don't know.

36:53.760 --> 36:56.440
Do you think he was pleased to find out he had a child?

36:56.480 --> 36:58.840
A daughter would mean responsibility.

36:58.880 --> 37:00.840
We're talking about a man who used to burn his bills

37:00.880 --> 37:03.480
when they came in so he didn't have

37:00.880 --> 37:03.480
to deal with them.

37:03.520 --> 37:06.360
Michelle seems to think he was happy.

37:06.400 --> 37:09.480
People put a brave face on things.

37:09.520 --> 37:12.800
But if he was nice to her,

37:14.920 --> 37:18.000
Because he died before she knew

37:14.920 --> 37:18.000
the man he was.

37:18.040 --> 37:21.200
Or maybe she did see that side of him.

37:22.280 --> 37:23.560
Poor girl.

37:23.600 --> 37:25.440
Is now a bad time?

37:25.480 --> 37:27.600
Not at all.

37:27.640 --> 37:29.360
Nice to see you all together.

37:29.400 --> 37:32.200
We just wanted to finalise the details

37:29.400 --> 37:32.200
for Solly's wake.

37:32.240 --> 37:34.120
Yeah, very conscientious.

37:35.160 --> 37:37.160
We've known each other for 20 years.

37:38.880 --> 37:40.760
What else did you expect?

37:48.240 --> 37:51.120
It's natural they'd all come together

37:48.240 --> 37:51.120
at a time like this.

38:01.800 --> 38:04.440
There's something we're missing.

38:01.800 --> 38:04.440
Got to be.

38:04.480 --> 38:06.200
Maybe they were all in it together.

38:06.240 --> 38:09.960
No. No, one of them would have cracked,

38:06.240 --> 38:09.960
given something away.

38:10.000 --> 38:12.120
Okay, so, Avita,

38:12.160 --> 38:14.480
angry at her husband for the child he

38:12.160 --> 38:14.480
never knew about.

38:14.520 --> 38:17.640
Curtis, jealous of him for the years

38:14.520 --> 38:17.640
stolen with the girl he loved.

38:17.680 --> 38:20.480
Michelle, her mother left to bring her up alone.

38:20.520 --> 38:24.400
And then there's the rest of the band. Will you please

38:20.520 --> 38:24.400
turn this racket off!

38:24.440 --> 38:27.280
-Sir. -I can't work with this...

38:27.320 --> 38:28.840
noise!

38:30.160 --> 38:31.720
You are being too hard.

38:40.640 --> 38:42.280
It's a police station, not a discotheque.

38:42.320 --> 38:45.080
No, not on Dwayne. On yourself.

38:45.120 --> 38:48.920
Sometimes you just have to relax,

38:45.120 --> 38:48.920
go with the flow.

38:50.520 --> 38:51.920
Please tell me you didn't just say that.

38:51.960 --> 38:54.360
I just mean if you loosen up a little,

38:54.400 --> 38:56.880
you'll unwind, things wouldn't be so tough.

38:57.160 --> 38:58.720
Yep.

38:58.760 --> 39:00.240
Music, please, Dwayne.

39:00.280 --> 39:02.160
-CAMILLE: Oh, come on, sir. -No, no, I need to loosen up.

39:02.200 --> 39:04.440
I'm going to rip off all my clothes

39:02.200 --> 39:04.440
and limbo under a desk!

39:05.840 --> 39:07.760
-He was being sarcastic.

39:07.800 --> 39:09.240
-So you want me to... -Yes.

39:09.280 --> 39:11.960
-No. -Come on,

39:09.280 --> 39:11.960
you've made your point.

39:15.040 --> 39:16.760
This song.

39:16.800 --> 39:19.120
<i>The Serpent Suite.</i>

39:19.160 --> 39:21.520
It's the one they play when Solly comes

39:19.160 --> 39:21.520
on stage, yeah?

39:21.560 --> 39:23.080
Yes.

39:23.120 --> 39:25.080
I need to hear the version they played on the night.

39:25.120 --> 39:26.760
-This is it. -No, no, no.

39:26.800 --> 39:28.480
No, no, this is the studio version.

39:28.520 --> 39:30.880
I need the actual one. The live one they played

39:28.520 --> 39:30.880
the night of the murder.

39:30.920 --> 39:33.760
Unless you have a time machine,

39:30.920 --> 39:33.760
that's going to be impossible.

39:35.240 --> 39:38.000
Nothing is impossible. Fidel.

39:43.240 --> 39:44.600
How you doing, Ricky?

39:44.640 --> 39:47.240
Fidel, grab it. We'll take this.

39:47.280 --> 39:48.800
God bless Solly.

39:48.840 --> 39:50.640
You got any live stuff?

39:50.680 --> 39:52.800
We're looking for a bootleg of last night's show.

39:52.840 --> 39:55.880
No, no. Be illegal. We don't carry that.

39:58.400 --> 40:00.880
Now, you and I both know that isn't true.

40:00.920 --> 40:03.880
So, unless you want me to look for myself...

40:05.600 --> 40:07.640
Shame the show ended early

40:05.600 --> 40:07.640
the other night, huh?

40:07.680 --> 40:09.080
Yeah.

40:20.920 --> 40:23.720
Look, I think he's getting into it.

40:23.760 --> 40:25.080
What, the music?

40:25.120 --> 40:26.840
He can't help it.

40:26.880 --> 40:29.240
Even if it only lasts a few minutes.

40:29.280 --> 40:30.840
The rhythm gets to you.

40:31.840 --> 40:34.120
-Not the Chief. -Not the Chief.

40:34.160 --> 40:36.800
I mean, can you really imagine him getting on down,

40:34.160 --> 40:36.800
dancing away to it?

40:36.840 --> 40:39.160
-Yes. -I can hear you, you know.

40:46.640 --> 40:48.800
In your professional opinion, on a scale of one to 10,

40:48.840 --> 40:50.360
how would you class Solly's band?

40:50.880 --> 40:52.360
A 10.

40:52.400 --> 40:54.680
Keep good time

40:52.400 --> 40:54.680
Rarely make mistakes?

40:54.720 --> 40:56.320
I'd say never.

40:56.360 --> 40:58.520
-Mmm.

40:58.560 --> 41:00.160
'Cause that's not what I'm hearing.

41:01.040 --> 41:03.440
Still, what do I know?

41:03.480 --> 41:05.240
You are the big fan.

41:05.280 --> 41:07.840
Now, let's see if they managed to hit

41:05.280 --> 41:07.840
the right notes on this,

41:07.880 --> 41:09.960
<i>The Greatest Hits.</i>

41:13.440 --> 41:16.160
-At the market.

41:16.200 --> 41:18.840
When we picked up the live one.

41:18.880 --> 41:21.160
-That's right.

41:21.200 --> 41:22.960
It came out yesterday.

41:23.000 --> 41:24.360
Apparently, it's very popular.

41:26.000 --> 41:27.440
Sorry. Excuse me. What do you think?

41:33.200 --> 41:35.160
All his best tunes are here.

41:35.200 --> 41:36.640
<i>J-J-Jamboree.</i>

41:36.680 --> 41:38.560
Oh,<i> Stick A Spell On My Heart.</i>

41:38.600 --> 41:40.760
And

41:41.440 --> 41:42.440
No.

41:43.800 --> 41:45.120
Oh, well,

41:45.160 --> 41:46.600
apart from the fact that

41:46.640 --> 41:49.520
even considering how fast digital production is,

41:49.560 --> 41:52.240
the band would have had to be pretty focused to get

41:52.280 --> 41:54.200
the CD burnt,

41:54.240 --> 41:56.560
cover designed, printed,

41:56.600 --> 42:01.400
packaged and distributed only one day

41:56.600 --> 42:01.400
after Solly's death.

42:01.440 --> 42:03.320
No, there's nothing else.

42:06.440 --> 42:08.400
Fidel, well?

42:08.440 --> 42:11.320
False alarm. Juliet thought she was going into labour.

42:11.880 --> 42:13.360
Trapped wind.

42:13.400 --> 42:14.720
You know, for a moment there,

42:14.760 --> 42:16.360
I really thought the baby was coming early.

42:16.400 --> 42:17.520
Whoa.

42:18.440 --> 42:21.560
Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

42:25.360 --> 42:27.920
There's a time period in which you are expecting

42:25.360 --> 42:27.920
the baby to arrive, yeah?

42:27.960 --> 42:29.080
Right.

42:29.120 --> 42:31.440
And all things going to plan,

42:32.080 --> 42:33.720
that will happen.

42:33.760 --> 42:35.360
Of course.

42:38.280 --> 42:40.760
Okay, where's the rest of Michelle's photos?

42:40.800 --> 42:41.920
-On my desk. -Okay.

42:51.320 --> 42:52.520
Ah!

42:58.680 --> 43:00.560
The drums start,

43:00.600 --> 43:02.920
the bass comes in, the guitars,

43:03.560 --> 43:05.000
the horns.

43:05.040 --> 43:07.200
I have no idea what he's talking about.

43:07.240 --> 43:09.960
-It's a metaphor. -Right.

43:10.000 --> 43:11.240
I still have no idea.

43:11.280 --> 43:14.160
It all starts to come together.

43:14.200 --> 43:18.080
Separate pieces becoming one.

43:18.120 --> 43:20.200
Fidel, one last job for you. You can meet us there.

43:20.240 --> 43:22.720
-We have a wake to attend.

43:29.920 --> 43:32.120
You know, timing is everything.

43:32.160 --> 43:34.760
-Sorry!

43:34.800 --> 43:36.160
If you could join us.

43:36.200 --> 43:38.840
I just need to get everything ready for the wake.

43:38.880 --> 43:40.360
It'll only take a minute.

43:40.400 --> 43:41.400
Or 10.

43:42.360 --> 43:44.560
Ten golden minutes,

43:44.600 --> 43:47.600
the window of opportunity the murderer

43:44.600 --> 43:47.600
used to kill Solly.

43:54.320 --> 43:56.160
Taken by Michelle

43:56.200 --> 43:59.880
at 8:34, according to the camera, on the night of

43:56.200 --> 43:59.880
Solly's murder.

44:02.280 --> 44:04.200
And yet, the dressing room clock

44:04.960 --> 44:07.600
in this same photograph

44:07.640 --> 44:09.520
says it's 8:44.

44:09.560 --> 44:11.760
8:34 on the camera, 8:44 on

44:11.800 --> 44:14.000
the dressing room clock.

44:15.240 --> 44:16.600
Ten minutes.

44:16.640 --> 44:19.000
Here's a photograph I took of

44:16.640 --> 44:19.000
the dressing room clock

44:20.800 --> 44:22.720
Same camera,

44:22.760 --> 44:24.640
same dressing room clock.

44:24.680 --> 44:27.440
And the time on the dressing room clock?

44:28.040 --> 44:29.360
11:55.

44:30.880 --> 44:32.280
And the time on the camera?

44:34.560 --> 44:36.120
11:55.

44:37.160 --> 44:38.840
Thank you, Renward.

44:40.600 --> 44:44.120
Hmm. We were meant to believe that Solly died

44:40.600 --> 44:44.120
in the 15 minutes

44:44.160 --> 44:46.800
before he went on stage.

44:46.840 --> 44:50.240
His alone time. But he didn't.

44:50.280 --> 44:56.720
Because someone changed the dressing room clock.

44:56.760 --> 45:00.000
Unknown to Solly, he got into the coffin

44:56.760 --> 45:00.000
10 minutes early,

45:00.040 --> 45:02.240
giving the killer time to do the job,

45:02.280 --> 45:04.240
then slip away and join the others,

45:04.280 --> 45:08.120
leaving no one any the wiser as to the fact that

45:04.280 --> 45:08.120
Solly was already dead.

45:09.000 --> 45:12.560
Hmm, that's interesting.

45:12.600 --> 45:15.400
Now none of you has an alibi for the time of the murder.

45:17.480 --> 45:19.560
So, who's the killer?

45:22.560 --> 45:24.600
Curtis.

45:24.640 --> 45:26.800
Broken-hearted, jealous.

45:28.640 --> 45:30.600
Eddie.

45:30.640 --> 45:34.440
All that effort put into the reunion and Solly still

45:30.640 --> 45:34.440
ungrateful as ever.

45:34.480 --> 45:38.480
Renward, the man who loved the band.

45:38.520 --> 45:40.960
Cast out for ten years waiting on the whim of his singer.

45:42.640 --> 45:44.160
Avita.

45:44.200 --> 45:47.600
Many women would have walked away a long time ago.

45:47.640 --> 45:49.840
No one could fault you for trying,

45:47.640 --> 45:49.840
just as no one could fault you

45:49.880 --> 45:54.120
for finally breaking when you found out

45:49.880 --> 45:54.120
about the daughter.

45:54.160 --> 45:57.760
Michelle, Solly walked out on your mother.

45:57.800 --> 46:00.720
Didn't want to know, left her to

45:57.800 --> 46:00.720
bring you up alone.

46:00.760 --> 46:03.600
Can't have been easy.

46:03.640 --> 46:06.920
-Everyone had a motive. -Uh, you missed someone.

46:07.520 --> 46:09.760
-No. -Me.

46:09.800 --> 46:11.000
Well, you didn't do it.

46:11.040 --> 46:13.960
What was your motive?

46:15.560 --> 46:17.160
No.

46:18.080 --> 46:20.480
RICHARD: But you're not wrong.

46:20.520 --> 46:24.280
I mean, you're not the killer, but you have hit

46:20.520 --> 46:24.280
the big question.

46:24.320 --> 46:26.160
Who stood to gain from Solly's death?

46:27.160 --> 46:29.600
After all, the new CD is available

46:29.640 --> 46:32.880
from all good market stalls and retailers now.

46:32.920 --> 46:35.560
In fact, I checked.

46:35.600 --> 46:38.400
And interestingly enough, it's going to make the

46:35.600 --> 46:38.400
Caribbean charts next week,

46:38.440 --> 46:40.840
top ten.

46:43.560 --> 46:44.840
And why?

46:45.560 --> 46:47.200
Because Solly is dead. Precisely.

46:49.440 --> 46:51.080
As career moves go,

46:51.120 --> 46:54.720
I understand it's one of

46:51.120 --> 46:54.720
popular music's finest.

46:54.760 --> 46:58.320
Did, um, Solly have life insurance?

46:58.360 --> 47:00.000
He thought he was going to live forever.

47:00.720 --> 47:02.720
Savings?

47:03.280 --> 47:05.160
Surely a will?

47:07.680 --> 47:10.040
So, he leaves nothing but the music.

47:10.080 --> 47:11.920
And the royalties.

47:11.960 --> 47:14.440
-No.

47:14.480 --> 47:16.600
I just played guitar. All royalties go

47:16.640 --> 47:18.760
to the songwriters,

47:18.800 --> 47:20.480
which is Solly and...

47:24.440 --> 47:25.600
Eddie.

47:29.240 --> 47:30.760
Never going to commit to a tour, was he?

47:31.680 --> 47:32.680
New album,

47:34.000 --> 47:36.440
doubt it'd sell enough to cover the costs.

47:36.480 --> 47:41.320
In fact, alive he was worthless.

47:41.360 --> 47:45.680
One last show. One last payday.

47:47.080 --> 47:48.680
<i>It was you</i>

47:48.720 --> 47:50.880
<i>who changed the time</i> <i>on the dressing room clock,</i>

47:52.840 --> 47:55.360
<i>making Solly head off</i> <i>to the coffin early.</i>

47:57.000 --> 48:00.200
<i>Fireworks were due</i> <i>to start around 8:35.</i>

48:00.240 --> 48:02.400
<i>And so they did.</i> <i>Right on time.</i>

48:13.080 --> 48:16.760
<i>Then there you were,</i> <i>making sure you were noticed.</i>

48:16.800 --> 48:19.120
<i>If anyone was asked</i> <i>what time they saw you,</i>

48:19.160 --> 48:21.920
<i>it would be the same time</i> <i>that Solly was alone.</i>

48:21.960 --> 48:23.480
You knew Solly better than anyone,

48:23.520 --> 48:24.720
knew that he'd be in the coffin,

48:24.760 --> 48:26.080
knew that you'd have time to shoot him,

48:26.120 --> 48:27.640
make it look like suicide,

48:27.680 --> 48:30.480
then be back with the rest of the band

48:27.680 --> 48:30.480
before anyone realised,

48:30.520 --> 48:32.960
ready to go on stage.

48:33.000 --> 48:36.880
And everything was going to plan.

48:36.920 --> 48:39.240
Neville would fetch the coffin just after 9:00.

48:40.640 --> 48:42.600
He'd find it open, Solly dead.

48:42.640 --> 48:45.960
Suicide. Tragic.

48:46.000 --> 48:48.800
Another casualty of rock 'n' roll,

48:46.000 --> 48:48.800
another legend born,

48:48.840 --> 48:51.560
another album flying off the shelves.

48:53.240 --> 48:55.480
<i>You were so surprised</i> <i>when you saw</i>

48:53.240 --> 48:55.480
<i>that coffin arrive,</i>

48:55.520 --> 48:56.760
<i>you lost it for a moment,</i> <i>didn't you?</i>

48:58.920 --> 49:00.880
You should have been playing an A.

49:00.920 --> 49:02.360
You played an E-flat.

49:10.840 --> 49:12.560
So, I hit a wrong note.

49:12.600 --> 49:16.040
-It's not a crime. -No, but murder is.

49:18.440 --> 49:21.960
You love the limelight, you can't just sit back out

49:18.440 --> 49:21.960
of the way, can you?

49:22.000 --> 49:24.360
When you find out it's a murder investigation,

49:24.400 --> 49:28.240
you plant a snake, trying to implicate Curtis.

49:28.280 --> 49:30.400
A move not unlike your songwriting.

49:30.440 --> 49:33.880
Brash, unsubtle, clumsy.

49:33.920 --> 49:35.920
So clumsy you didn't even think

49:33.920 --> 49:35.920
to wipe your fingerprints

49:35.960 --> 49:38.320
off the dressing room clock when you changed the time.

49:38.360 --> 49:42.040
That's right, got your sticky fingers

49:38.360 --> 49:42.040
all over it.

49:52.400 --> 49:56.600
I've got a top 10 album. What have you got, huh?

49:56.640 --> 49:58.520
-You've got something else as well.

49:58.560 --> 50:01.200
This.

50:01.240 --> 50:02.640
Been wanting to do that for years.

50:02.680 --> 50:04.840
Is there anyone in this band you do like?

50:04.880 --> 50:07.480
Everyone will remember me.

50:07.520 --> 50:08.960
This is the story.

50:09.000 --> 50:11.400
You got a singer and a songwriter.

50:11.440 --> 50:13.600
One's dead, one's a killer.

50:13.640 --> 50:14.920
I'm a legend!

50:16.800 --> 50:18.400
I don't know about that. You're just the bass player.

50:56.960 --> 50:59.880
You think they could turn this down a little?

50:59.920 --> 51:02.320
I just don't see why it always has to be so loud.

51:02.360 --> 51:05.400
So you can feel the rhythm in your head,

51:05.440 --> 51:07.000
your feet, your heart.

51:13.920 --> 51:16.200
-No. -One song and it's a slow one.

51:16.240 --> 51:18.520
-I do not dance. -You've got a good ear.

51:18.560 --> 51:20.800
The only person who noticed that off note in the song.

51:20.840 --> 51:22.040
Ears aren't feet.

51:22.080 --> 51:24.480
Richard, it's what Solly would have wanted.

51:39.240 --> 51:40.920
Richard!
