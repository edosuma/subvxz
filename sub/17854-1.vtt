Did you get Karen's memo?

00:35.634 --> 00:38.440
Yeah. She expects us to have
the sales projections by Monday?

00:38.475 --> 00:39.946
We just got the numbers yesterday.

00:40.004 --> 00:41.058
I hear you, man.

00:41.093 --> 00:42.494
My weekend is now officially fu...

00:49.265 --> 00:50.678
Excuse us.

01:41.396 --> 01:43.623
I want you to know

01:43.693 --> 01:45.789
that I take no pleasure
in what I'm about to do.

01:49.828 --> 01:51.763
No!

02:06.144 --> 02:10.479
Meanwhile, Hurricane Zoe has finally made
landfall on the coast of Rhode Island.

02:10.573 --> 02:12.304
It is yet unclear if the Providence levees

02:12.368 --> 02:15.252
will be able to sustain
a category-five storm.

02:15.287 --> 02:19.456
The material damages could
be in the billions of dollars.

02:19.603 --> 02:22.622
In other news, the Canadian
Prime Minister today announced

02:22.684 --> 02:25.267
the construction of a
new high-security fence,

02:25.314 --> 02:29.742
after 2073 became a record
year for illegal immigration.

02:29.820 --> 02:32.937
It is estimated that already
12 million U.S. citizens

02:32.972 --> 02:35.397
live in Canadian territory illegally.

02:35.444 --> 02:37.968
Gasgo Oil unveiled its
third offshore platform

02:38.003 --> 02:40.176
- on the former Arctic ice cap.
- Mute.

02:40.211 --> 02:42.056
- Good morning, Mr. Larson.
- Good morning, Rachel.

02:42.080 --> 02:44.882
This looks absolutely perfect.

02:44.917 --> 02:46.083
Thank you.

02:46.118 --> 02:48.021
- Morning, Rachel.
- Good morning.

02:48.056 --> 02:50.376
What is this?

02:50.439 --> 02:51.906
Real deal?

02:51.960 --> 02:54.157
I thought a special breakfast was in order.

02:54.192 --> 02:56.227
Three years.

02:56.262 --> 02:58.262
That's the bacon anniversary, right?

02:59.565 --> 03:02.307
I don't think I can
go back to that petri-shit.

03:02.370 --> 03:03.976
I don't think we can afford not to.

03:07.106 --> 03:08.629
Bacon.

03:10.796 --> 03:12.733
My God.

03:12.804 --> 03:16.645
- Shit. Unmute.
- Suspected terrorist attack.

03:16.715 --> 03:19.070
Local authorities blame
the Sons of Tomorrow,

03:19.109 --> 03:21.287
but the radical Micronesian
nationalist group

03:21.342 --> 03:23.888
has not yet claimed responsibility.

03:23.923 --> 03:28.324
The device detonated in an R & D
lab of the biochemical giant Spiga,

03:28.424 --> 03:32.816
causing at least a dozen fatalities and
an immediate drop in the company's stock.

03:32.851 --> 03:34.584
It had to happen, today of all days.

03:34.619 --> 03:36.418
Security at the office
is gonna be a shit show.

03:36.442 --> 03:39.105
Hey, I'm glad they're
there to keep you safe.

03:43.867 --> 03:45.096
Work.

03:48.034 --> 03:49.201
News.

03:49.236 --> 03:52.922
Spiga executive Elizabeth Krauss
addressed shareholders this morning,

03:53.015 --> 03:55.840
after the company's stock plummeted
in the wake of the bombing.

03:55.875 --> 03:57.759
Meanwhile, shares of
their chief competitor,

03:57.807 --> 04:01.792
Inazagi Biodesign, soared to
a new high in early trading.

04:09.711 --> 04:12.299
In local news, the latest
wave of food shortages

04:12.351 --> 04:15.053
in the Red Zones has led to a 10% increase

04:15.088 --> 04:18.060
in break-ins into Green
Zone residential areas.

04:18.142 --> 04:21.344
Corporate security forces
recommend caution and vigilance,

04:21.379 --> 04:24.781
especially in and around
perimeter checkpoints.

04:38.538 --> 04:40.779
Over the past 40 years,

04:40.870 --> 04:46.025
Spiga Biotech has been at the forefront
of the genetic-engineering revolution.

04:46.111 --> 04:48.491
We designed seeds capable of thriving

04:48.573 --> 04:51.774
in the increasingly harsh
environments of our planet.

04:51.887 --> 04:54.201
Our pest- and
drought-resistant crops

04:54.240 --> 04:57.206
are now sold in over 100 countries,

04:57.278 --> 05:01.534
and our advancements in in vitro meat
have transformed the SynthFood industry.

05:01.569 --> 05:04.404
- _
- Spiga. Committed to feeding

05:04.439 --> 05:06.215
our ever-growing world.

05:06.270 --> 05:07.925
Full cavity search for my friend here.

05:08.012 --> 05:09.793
- Next.
- Hey, Roger.

05:09.828 --> 05:12.760
These guys seem in an
especially pissy mood today.

05:12.795 --> 05:14.074
Don't you watch the news?

05:14.145 --> 05:16.548
Micronesian nationalists killed
a dozen of our guys today.

05:16.583 --> 05:19.830
How can you be a nationalist
when your nation's under water?

05:19.882 --> 05:21.612
I know, it's like calling
yourself a New Yorker.

05:21.636 --> 05:23.370
Nationalists, my ass.

05:23.478 --> 05:25.327
Word is it was Inazagi agents.

05:25.415 --> 05:27.390
Inazagi? You think they'd dare to?

05:27.437 --> 05:29.596
They're making a play for the Asian market.

05:29.664 --> 05:31.622
I'm telling you guys, this
was no terrorist attack.

05:31.646 --> 05:34.811
This was sabotage.

05:40.559 --> 05:42.382
Step out of the scanner, sir.

05:44.874 --> 05:47.672
Place your briefcase on the slab, slowly.

05:50.238 --> 05:52.339
We've got a code six down here.

05:52.483 --> 05:54.418
Looks like some kind of malware.

05:59.478 --> 06:03.459
- Doesn't seem to be booby-trapped.

06:03.494 --> 06:04.906
I'm gonna open it.

06:10.858 --> 06:12.617
I'm turning it on now.

06:16.862 --> 06:20.564
God, I want you in my mouth.

06:21.806 --> 06:24.101
False alarm. It's just food porn.

06:29.818 --> 06:32.955
Loser.

06:34.680 --> 06:37.931
The Everclear software scans
the subject's brainwaves

06:37.966 --> 06:39.398
and translates them into images.

06:39.527 --> 06:41.303
Literally shows you what they're thinking.

06:41.360 --> 06:43.495
Most importantly, what they're dreaming.

06:43.672 --> 06:46.946
Traitors. They can't lie
in their sleep, right?

06:47.023 --> 06:48.864
What's the accuracy?

06:52.326 --> 06:55.228
We're at 65%... for now.

06:55.294 --> 06:57.627
Will that hold as the subject sleeps?

06:57.662 --> 07:01.977
Um, no. No, we expect to
lose ten points during R.E.M.

07:06.516 --> 07:08.918
What happened yesterday in Jakarta...

07:09.181 --> 07:12.493
someone's gonna end up in
the Quiet Room for that.

07:12.560 --> 07:14.958
Do you understand what that means?

07:15.069 --> 07:17.685
Well, we've all heard stories.

07:23.821 --> 07:28.856
If you really knew, you
wouldn't send anyone my way

07:28.891 --> 07:31.827
on a 55% chance he's guilty.

07:31.862 --> 07:33.252
- We would never run...
- I am as disappointed

07:33.276 --> 07:34.967
as you are, sir.

07:35.037 --> 07:36.664
55%'s unacceptable.

07:36.699 --> 07:39.569
We'll pick up the pace. That's a guarantee.

07:52.679 --> 07:54.712
Is there a problem?

07:54.747 --> 07:56.046
No problem.

07:56.082 --> 07:57.488
Everclear's learning.

07:57.558 --> 08:01.093
- It'll hit 75% in 6 months.
- Good.

08:01.191 --> 08:04.434
But not before.

08:04.512 --> 08:06.487
What are you trying to say, Ben?

08:06.558 --> 08:10.440
Just that maybe you should be careful with
the promises you make, especially to him.

08:12.018 --> 08:14.588
I mean, we've all heard stories, right?

08:58.792 --> 09:00.274
What's your name?

09:02.714 --> 09:04.314
It's Theo.

09:04.645 --> 09:08.616
This is real tobacco, Theo.

09:11.785 --> 09:13.487
No sawdust.

09:16.733 --> 09:20.048
And where does a little shit
like you get something like this?

09:26.267 --> 09:28.533
I like you, boy.

09:28.709 --> 09:30.439
Can't make a buck in
this world without a bit

09:30.463 --> 09:33.866
of an entrepreneurial spirit
and a big set of balls.

09:35.785 --> 09:38.019
But if I let any punk

09:38.093 --> 09:41.919
with a set of balls and a pack
of smokes sell in my backyard...

09:43.159 --> 09:46.668
well, then supply is gonna exceed demand.

09:46.754 --> 09:51.000
That creates what's known
as a zero-profit condition.

09:51.674 --> 09:54.143
That's no good for anybody,

09:54.231 --> 09:55.767
especially me.

09:58.835 --> 10:01.481
So this...

10:01.540 --> 10:03.628
This is what I like to call

10:03.677 --> 10:08.281
a strategic entry deterrent.

10:20.498 --> 10:22.867
What the hell happened to you?

10:26.762 --> 10:28.971
You did that?

10:29.059 --> 10:31.091
Yeah.

10:31.166 --> 10:33.228
Yeah, yeah, I did.

10:40.336 --> 10:41.923
Show me.

11:25.461 --> 11:27.930
Not bad, kid.

11:27.965 --> 11:30.600
How'd you like to make some money?

13:01.681 --> 13:04.417
Aaron, stop!

13:24.498 --> 13:27.423
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

13:27.458 --> 13:29.726
I just... I lost track.
This whole Jakarta thing...

13:29.761 --> 13:32.717
- everyone's been...
- Hey, it's fine.

13:32.752 --> 13:33.519
Really.

13:33.573 --> 13:36.008
You're here. We're here.

13:36.141 --> 13:38.444
Champagne... your best Norwegian.

13:38.479 --> 13:40.679
Right away, sir.

13:40.760 --> 13:43.921
Better enjoy this while I still can.

13:43.956 --> 13:45.855
What do you mean?

13:45.898 --> 13:48.533
I got some news today.

13:48.648 --> 13:52.261
The permit. It came through.

13:52.311 --> 13:55.171
- The permit?
- From Spiga.

13:55.264 --> 13:57.558
I'm gonna make an
appointment with their OB-GYN.

13:57.605 --> 13:59.710
He's gonna remove the IUD.

14:01.836 --> 14:04.655
Pulling the goalie.

14:04.763 --> 14:05.604
- Wow.
- What?

14:05.639 --> 14:07.339
That's...

14:07.374 --> 14:08.607
What's wrong?

14:08.642 --> 14:10.889
Nothing. It's great.

14:10.952 --> 14:13.845
It's great. I just... I thought...

14:13.959 --> 14:15.281
we'd have to wait much longer,

14:15.357 --> 14:18.750
you know, until I made it
to the 40th floor, at least.

14:19.135 --> 14:20.837
Well, then it's good news, right?

14:20.872 --> 14:22.482
It means they like you.

14:22.543 --> 14:24.662
It's not so hard to believe.

14:24.756 --> 14:27.727
I'm still trying to wrap my head
around the fact that you like me.

14:27.821 --> 14:29.234
Come on, Ben.

14:29.289 --> 14:33.132
You've got a charm switch.
I've never seen it off.

14:33.276 --> 14:36.035
- What does that mean?
- Nothing.

14:36.102 --> 14:40.701
It's just you're... you're always so...

14:40.783 --> 14:43.051
sunny.

14:43.187 --> 14:44.767
And that's bad?

14:44.802 --> 14:47.237
No.

14:47.420 --> 14:51.090
I-I just... I wish it
were that easy for me.

14:54.858 --> 14:57.358
Trust me.

14:57.557 --> 15:00.426
It's harder than it seems.

15:17.738 --> 15:21.359
I'm just asking you to call
off your troops, that's all.

15:21.414 --> 15:24.433
This is just a case of crosspollination.

15:24.468 --> 15:26.311
So they claim, Senator.

15:26.358 --> 15:29.862
From where I'm sitting, it looks
like copyright infringement, theft.

15:29.927 --> 15:32.552
And that warrants having
their fields torched?

15:32.645 --> 15:34.893
You could convince them
to pay the royalties.

15:34.928 --> 15:38.785
Our designs are giving these farmers
the biggest harvest of their lives.

15:38.832 --> 15:42.200
Sure, of sterile seeds that
won't sprout, come next season.

15:42.271 --> 15:45.003
Well, we have to protect our
intellectual property somehow.

15:45.038 --> 15:48.347
I'm just trying to give you a
little friendly advice, Elizabeth.

15:48.402 --> 15:49.378
My constituents...

15:49.413 --> 15:52.106
Your constituents burnt
down three of our silos.

15:52.141 --> 15:53.144
Exactly.

15:53.179 --> 15:57.096
You're sitting on a powder keg here,
and you don't seem to realize it.

15:57.131 --> 15:59.151
Answer me this, Senator...

15:59.236 --> 16:02.233
what was the turnout in
this state last November?

16:02.327 --> 16:04.657
I don't know. 25%.

16:04.692 --> 16:06.425
22%.

16:06.532 --> 16:09.128
So just ask yourself,
when the midterms come,

16:09.199 --> 16:11.146
who are your constituents, really?

16:13.267 --> 16:16.200
- Problem?
- No, no problem.

16:16.235 --> 16:19.171
Bradley's a fool. He's not an idiot.

16:19.206 --> 16:22.976
He just sometimes forgets
it's not the '30s anymore.

16:27.194 --> 16:29.348
Look at those brushstrokes...

16:29.514 --> 16:33.333
furious and desperate, in
a mad rush to pour himself

16:33.400 --> 16:35.780
onto the canvas...

16:35.848 --> 16:38.682
as if he were running out of time.

16:38.859 --> 16:40.325
He was.

16:40.609 --> 16:42.807
He shot himself a year later.

16:44.966 --> 16:47.899
Poverty and suffering...

16:47.934 --> 16:50.970
do you think you can create
great art without them?

16:51.075 --> 16:54.691
They're powerful motivators.

16:54.750 --> 16:56.257
I guess they are.

16:56.321 --> 16:57.722
Maybe if he'd sold a painting,

16:57.803 --> 17:01.138
he would have been a lesser
artist and a happier man.

17:02.008 --> 17:05.019
I wonder if he would
have made that bargain.

17:08.319 --> 17:10.319
So the Smithsonian caved?

17:10.433 --> 17:13.702
Yep, just last week.

17:13.752 --> 17:15.719
They fought and fought, ended up getting

17:15.753 --> 17:19.236
half of what we offered them last year.

17:19.301 --> 17:21.469
It's like you said...

17:21.644 --> 17:23.612
poverty's a powerful motivator.

17:27.991 --> 17:31.325
So, Laura...

17:31.525 --> 17:34.060
how is she?

17:34.111 --> 17:38.614
You know, you could ask her.

17:39.224 --> 17:41.119
I'm asking you.

17:41.266 --> 17:43.829
Maybe if you could convince
my own daughter to talk to me,

17:43.885 --> 17:44.885
I wouldn't have to.

17:48.883 --> 17:51.115
Bring out your inner beauty.

17:51.188 --> 17:55.023
Bring out a more perfect you.

17:55.058 --> 17:57.303
- And this is...
- Bruce.

17:57.396 --> 17:59.061
The late Mr. Granger...

17:59.096 --> 18:01.377
on our honeymoon.

18:01.412 --> 18:03.847
So is it possible?

18:09.482 --> 18:12.818
Well, they've got similar bone structure.

18:12.957 --> 18:15.053
So...

18:15.088 --> 18:18.857
sure, it's possible, if that's
what you and your fiancÃ© want.

18:18.892 --> 18:20.326
It is.

18:21.828 --> 18:26.268
Mr. Salgado, are you aware
what the procedure will involve?

18:26.303 --> 18:28.637
Yes.

18:28.726 --> 18:33.162
So you understand that you
will look exactly like this man?

18:35.476 --> 18:36.334
Yes.

18:36.369 --> 18:38.536
Of course he understands.

18:38.614 --> 18:42.583
Then could you please repeat back
to me what you think will happen?

18:44.816 --> 18:46.383
Yes.

18:46.441 --> 18:49.641
Look...

18:49.676 --> 18:52.138
he wants the life that I can give him.

18:52.240 --> 18:53.930
And he doesn't want to
go back to the Red Zones.

18:53.954 --> 18:57.057
He understands that much.

19:14.025 --> 19:15.625
Hey, babe.

19:15.785 --> 19:18.051
She summoned me today.

19:18.164 --> 19:21.065
She did? What did she want?

19:21.163 --> 19:23.131
She wants to take you out for lunch.

19:23.181 --> 19:24.747
So now you're her errand boy?

19:24.782 --> 19:27.341
Well, I'm your husband
and her son-in-law.

19:27.398 --> 19:28.276
Sorry.

19:28.330 --> 19:29.410
Look, Laura, just meet her.

19:29.436 --> 19:31.916
If she's gonna be a grandmother,
she has a right to know.

19:31.992 --> 19:34.973
Right, 'cause she's got
grandmother written all over her.

19:35.008 --> 19:38.803
Still, she's the only grandparent
this kid will ever have.

19:38.838 --> 19:42.462
I'll think about it, okay?

19:42.497 --> 19:45.399
So what are we doing tonight?

19:45.620 --> 19:48.567
We were thinking about going
out for drinks after work...

19:48.637 --> 19:50.671
Roger, a few of the guys.

19:50.706 --> 19:52.068
You're welcome to join us.

19:52.103 --> 19:55.230
Great, I could really use a drink.

19:55.265 --> 19:57.394
Where's the fun gonna be?

19:57.429 --> 19:59.049
They're thinking Southgate.

20:04.123 --> 20:06.328
- Ben...
- I know.

20:06.363 --> 20:08.132
I know, I'm sorry.

20:08.167 --> 20:12.771
It's not my idea, trust me.
But you know how Roger rolls.

20:12.927 --> 20:15.705
I can blow it off if you want me to.

20:15.740 --> 20:19.108
No, no.

20:19.159 --> 20:22.404
I'm... I'm tired, anyway.

20:23.244 --> 20:25.279
You guys have fun.

20:29.706 --> 20:33.305
Just be safe out there.

20:33.390 --> 20:35.990
Yeah, I'll do my best.

20:36.197 --> 20:39.457
- Love you.
- You too.

20:49.753 --> 20:50.776
Aah!

21:05.462 --> 21:07.154
Dr. Larson?

21:07.194 --> 21:09.562
Your 11:00 is here.

21:09.606 --> 21:11.437
I need a minute.

21:38.508 --> 21:40.777
Send him in.

21:50.198 --> 21:52.819
I think I found her.

21:53.069 --> 21:55.924
I make these myself
every morning, you know?

21:56.008 --> 21:58.760
I wake up at 6:00, and I make them

21:58.795 --> 22:01.430
just how she likes them...

22:01.465 --> 22:04.633
no crust, extra mayo.

22:04.668 --> 22:07.970
Two for her, two for myself.

22:08.111 --> 22:09.865
I like to know we're having the same lunch

22:09.900 --> 22:12.109
while she's at school.

22:14.675 --> 22:17.056
I'm just trying to give you a heads-up.

22:17.118 --> 22:18.389
Things are about to get rocky around here.

22:18.413 --> 22:21.149
That's not how this works.

22:23.275 --> 22:26.189
You keep your head
down, you enjoy the life,

22:26.283 --> 22:28.391
you blend in.

22:28.524 --> 22:32.228
That's what I taught you.
That's how we stay alive.

22:32.366 --> 22:35.030
You know how long I've
been looking for her?

22:35.216 --> 22:36.815
Now she's been transferred
back to Milwaukee,

22:36.839 --> 22:39.940
but who knows for how long?

22:40.638 --> 22:41.824
I got to get to her.

22:42.887 --> 22:45.808
So what are you gonna do?

22:45.843 --> 22:48.672
Get myself a promotion.

22:48.734 --> 22:51.446
Don't be fu... ing stupid.

22:51.662 --> 22:55.174
The higher up you go, the less
you can hide. It's impossible.

22:55.209 --> 22:59.590
You told me it was impossible to get to
management at all, but here I am, so...

23:02.692 --> 23:05.594
Kids, man...

23:05.629 --> 23:07.797
they change your life.

23:07.832 --> 23:10.965
They set your priorities straight.

23:11.000 --> 23:14.369
You'll see.

23:14.404 --> 23:18.575
It starts tonight. Just watch your back.

23:23.581 --> 23:24.946
Gentlemen!

23:24.981 --> 23:28.250
Are you ready for some good,
old-fashioned debauchery?

23:28.285 --> 23:29.718
- Yeah!
- Southgate, baby!

23:29.753 --> 23:30.464
Whoo!

23:30.499 --> 23:32.630
What is he... did you invite him?

23:32.665 --> 23:35.829
- Sure.
- You're working him, right?

23:35.876 --> 23:39.354
- Just burying the hatchet.
- Right.

24:12.688 --> 24:14.888
Hey, you like my tits?

24:14.923 --> 24:17.157
Hey! Where are you going?

24:17.192 --> 24:20.229
Hey, come back! Asshole!

24:28.269 --> 24:30.638
- Hey, Rog.
- Keep an eye on my boy's car.

24:30.673 --> 24:32.374
You got it.

24:35.743 --> 24:37.744
Go ahead, I'll catch up inside.

24:37.779 --> 24:42.916
- Sure thing, you degenerate.
- Hey, you're partaking, too.

25:25.753 --> 25:27.120
Hey!

25:27.296 --> 25:29.609
Hey! What am I, invisible?

25:29.644 --> 25:32.548
- Hey, hey!
- Cash only out here.

25:32.619 --> 25:35.371
Hey, asshole!

25:38.907 --> 25:41.078
Your friend sent these over.

25:41.158 --> 25:44.645
What?

25:44.680 --> 25:47.674
- Jangkar?
- It's Indonesian.

25:47.744 --> 25:49.483
Inazagi fu... ers.

25:49.518 --> 25:50.850
After what happened in Jakarta,

25:50.885 --> 25:53.286
we figured you guys could use a drink.

25:53.321 --> 25:56.823
- Cheers.
- Suck my dick.

25:56.858 --> 25:59.258
- Don't drink it.
- Sorry, it just...

25:59.305 --> 26:00.660
Ladies!

26:00.695 --> 26:03.196
Don't ever say I never
did anything for you.

26:03.231 --> 26:08.435
Here is some primo, triple-A,
thank-God-it's-Friday blur.

27:03.274 --> 27:04.935
- Come on.
- Come on.

27:04.970 --> 27:06.745
- Come on!
- Come on.

27:06.780 --> 27:08.144
- Come on.
- Drink up.

27:08.179 --> 27:12.299
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

27:15.517 --> 27:16.884
- And another!
- Come on, again!

27:16.919 --> 27:17.589
- Come on!
- Do it again!

27:17.624 --> 27:19.415
- Yeah, come on.
- Come on, go!

27:19.450 --> 27:24.211
Whoo!

27:26.052 --> 27:28.910
- Somebody's blurred out.
- I got him.

27:28.957 --> 27:29.998
Come on.

27:30.061 --> 27:32.186
Let's go, all right.

27:33.783 --> 27:36.365
- Hey, Ben.
- Yeah.

27:36.407 --> 27:38.476
- I'm not an asshole.
- I know.

27:38.511 --> 27:40.544
You know, it's just the pressure.

27:40.579 --> 27:44.280
They got your balls in a vise
and they just never let go.

27:44.315 --> 27:46.816
I know. Come on!

27:46.851 --> 27:49.186
- All right.
- I don't feel so good.

28:10.475 --> 28:14.478
Just a minute!

28:16.314 --> 28:17.568
- In a minute.
- Come on.

28:17.603 --> 28:19.634
- In a minute!
- Come on.

28:19.720 --> 28:21.297
I think I'm done.

28:21.351 --> 28:22.717
One more.

28:22.752 --> 28:25.643
Hang on!

28:28.991 --> 28:31.512
- What was that?
- What was what?

28:31.630 --> 28:33.943
Come on.

28:34.029 --> 28:35.538
Let me guess...

28:35.610 --> 28:37.467
pitcher, catcher?

28:37.502 --> 28:39.536
- Funny.
- Ho, where you going?

28:39.571 --> 28:41.281
There are so many more
puns where that came from.

28:41.305 --> 28:43.441
I haven't even started.

28:45.961 --> 28:47.058
What are you guys doing?

28:53.217 --> 28:55.031
Wow.

28:55.108 --> 28:57.410
Who are you?

28:57.460 --> 28:58.888
I'm Ben.

28:58.969 --> 29:01.605
Come on.

29:09.223 --> 29:11.457
Shoot. You think you can make it back?

29:11.548 --> 29:13.856
I... Yeah, yeah.

29:13.934 --> 29:16.127
- Why?
- I-I forgot something.

29:16.215 --> 29:18.618
- I'll be right back.
- Okay.

29:48.463 --> 29:51.758
Protect our resources, burn your future.

29:51.818 --> 29:55.154
Join the Inazagi Corporate Army.

29:59.837 --> 30:02.552
Protect our resources. Burn your future.

30:02.606 --> 30:05.708
- Heads up.
- Join the Inazagi Corporate Army.

30:10.053 --> 30:12.315
Hey, suit.

30:12.360 --> 30:14.698
- You're new.
- You're old.

30:22.448 --> 30:25.315
See this?

30:25.350 --> 30:26.960
Not my blood.

30:47.598 --> 30:49.866
18.

31:12.023 --> 31:14.124
Yeah?

31:14.159 --> 31:18.528
It's me.

31:18.563 --> 31:21.667
- Hey, Aaron.
- Theo.

31:23.569 --> 31:25.570
- What are you doing here?
- Getting the usual

31:25.625 --> 31:28.272
warm and fuzzy welcome, I gue...

31:28.307 --> 31:29.873
What's that?

31:29.908 --> 31:31.709
- What happened?
- Nothing.

31:31.744 --> 31:35.979
- What do you mean nothing?
- It... it's from training.

31:36.014 --> 31:37.448
I've started training.

31:37.483 --> 31:40.484
You mean for the cage?

31:40.519 --> 31:42.687
That's insane.

31:42.722 --> 31:45.488
- That's not what Terrence says.
- Terrence?

31:45.523 --> 31:47.291
Yeah, Terrence.

31:47.326 --> 31:49.560
He's the guy around here.

31:49.654 --> 31:51.492
He says we're gonna make a
shitload of money together.

31:51.516 --> 31:52.886
No, he'll make a shitload of money.

31:52.910 --> 31:55.999
You'll end up shitting
yourself on some street corner.

31:56.034 --> 31:57.901
What do you want me to do?

31:57.936 --> 31:59.894
Join one of the corporate armies?

31:59.957 --> 32:02.407
Get blown to pieces in
a gas field in Siberia?

32:05.012 --> 32:08.078
I bet you miss these.

32:08.368 --> 32:11.791
I bring you cigarettes, Theo... real ones.

32:11.826 --> 32:12.583
There's good money there.

32:12.655 --> 32:13.881
Yeah, and what do you
think got me into trouble

32:13.905 --> 32:16.040
with Terrence in the first place, Aaron?

32:18.256 --> 32:20.423
It's Ben.

32:20.458 --> 32:22.652
Yeah, sure, I'll call you Ben,

32:22.738 --> 32:24.961
as long as you don't forget Aaron.

32:24.996 --> 32:28.234
I don't.

32:35.174 --> 32:37.874
Is that... is that her?

32:37.909 --> 32:40.945
73% chance.

32:41.156 --> 32:43.179
I've never even come close to 40% before.

32:43.214 --> 32:44.484
- So you found her?
- I might have.

32:44.508 --> 32:45.900
- Where is she?
- If it is Elena...

32:45.935 --> 32:48.704
My sister. Where is she?

32:52.051 --> 32:54.824
That's a group of girls
being escorted to Arcadia.

32:55.115 --> 32:56.227
- New girls.
- That's a...

32:56.262 --> 32:57.791
- It's an executive club.
- Yeah, sure.

32:57.826 --> 32:58.945
Keep telling yourself that.

32:58.980 --> 33:00.395
- She's a sex slave.
- Theo.

33:00.466 --> 33:02.116
- Can you get in here?
- Not at my level.

33:02.151 --> 33:04.203
- And not till I get a promotion.
- You fu... ing suits.

33:04.227 --> 33:07.021
And not till I get to the 40th floor.

33:07.175 --> 33:11.625
Access is restricted to senior execs.

33:11.660 --> 33:15.020
It's been six years.

33:15.091 --> 33:18.694
I know.

33:18.822 --> 33:21.123
Tell me you got a plan.

33:24.529 --> 33:25.964
What's that?

33:28.943 --> 33:32.111
Opportunity.

33:32.146 --> 33:35.509
Position's about to open up on the 40th.

33:35.572 --> 33:37.584
Well, you got her in there,

33:37.619 --> 33:40.721
so you better get her out,

33:40.756 --> 33:43.443
for your sake and the sake of
that dumb piece of ass you got...

33:43.504 --> 33:45.673
Careful.

33:48.881 --> 33:50.813
You see, Ben...

33:50.965 --> 33:53.769
you're already forgetting.

33:59.132 --> 34:01.520
Here it is, The Whistle.

34:01.567 --> 34:03.330
I thought you were on the Everclear team.

34:03.365 --> 34:06.605
I am, but after Jakarta,
bosses are scrambling.

34:06.640 --> 34:08.840
They're fast-tracking any
anti-riot tech in development.

34:08.870 --> 34:10.286
Natives are getting restless?

34:10.322 --> 34:12.719
- Looks like it.
- Sign here.

34:12.755 --> 34:14.632
They're keeping it
exclusively nonlethal, though.

34:14.657 --> 34:16.725
Yeah, for now.

34:20.281 --> 34:22.417
The Whistle.

34:23.713 --> 34:26.333
See if you can
stabilize the inhibitors,

34:26.402 --> 34:28.815
'cause the pitch always
ends up frying the circuits.

34:28.885 --> 34:30.985
I'll see what I can do.

34:56.857 --> 34:57.970
What now?

34:58.012 --> 34:59.517
Mr. Larson's here to see you.

34:59.593 --> 35:01.493
Send him in.

35:03.981 --> 35:06.014
Ben.

35:06.080 --> 35:07.748
Crazy night?

35:07.910 --> 35:10.099
I woke up with this splitting headache...

35:10.147 --> 35:12.648
How can I help you?

35:13.115 --> 35:15.482
I've been thinking about Everclear,

35:15.517 --> 35:17.551
how to speed things up.

35:17.656 --> 35:20.626
You know, the learning process
is just a matter of manpower

35:20.661 --> 35:22.018
and putting in more hours.

35:22.090 --> 35:26.125
Tell me something I don't know.

35:26.160 --> 35:28.868
Well, what I'm suggesting
here is double shifts.

35:28.903 --> 35:31.098
I'm happy to do overtime.

35:31.133 --> 35:33.566
Come in on weekends,
get more test subjects.

35:33.652 --> 35:35.935
Sure, and go over budget and...

35:35.970 --> 35:39.038
We could bring in volunteers
from the Red Zones.

35:39.073 --> 35:40.205
Shouldn't be too expensive.

35:40.240 --> 35:42.589
The security clearance
process would be a nightmare.

35:42.644 --> 35:45.784
Look, Ben, I need to...

35:45.877 --> 35:47.911
Are you okay?

35:48.150 --> 35:51.323
I'm... I'm fine. Fine, I just...

35:51.392 --> 35:53.994
Excuse me a second, will you?

35:57.507 --> 35:58.639
Sir, are you all right?

37:08.548 --> 37:10.816
Mr. Peterson?

37:16.211 --> 37:18.478
M-Mr. Peterson?

37:50.626 --> 37:52.341
- How are you feeling?
- Fine, thanks.

37:55.095 --> 37:57.696
Can I get you anything?

37:57.786 --> 37:59.986
Some water? Coffee?

38:00.115 --> 38:02.309
No, you cannot.

38:02.391 --> 38:05.158
Are you sure?

38:05.263 --> 38:07.233
No, I'm fine, thanks.

38:10.224 --> 38:11.491
You okay?

38:11.722 --> 38:14.252
Yeah, yeah. Where were we?

38:14.287 --> 38:16.782
Um, Everclear. So...

38:18.220 --> 38:20.777
The flight is nine hours,
but it is totally worth it.

38:20.812 --> 38:24.295
They have the most beautiful
beaches just outside of Reykjavik.

38:24.368 --> 38:26.112
So you mean to tell me you don't miss it?

38:26.150 --> 38:29.971
- Ma'am, a package for you.
- Thank you.

38:30.056 --> 38:31.384
What... the ungodly hours,

38:31.439 --> 38:33.340
the mind-numbing quarterly meetings?

38:33.375 --> 38:35.201
Every frickin' day.

38:37.202 --> 38:40.196
What's wrong?

38:41.923 --> 38:44.158
- Is that...
- Henry's.

38:44.193 --> 38:46.653
Bastard's been slumming again...

38:46.699 --> 38:49.762
screwing that Red Zone
slut he has out there.

38:49.817 --> 38:51.665
And he got himself kidnapped.

38:51.700 --> 38:53.234
Idiot.

38:53.269 --> 38:55.136
Serves him right.

38:55.171 --> 38:57.939
They just can't help themselves, can they?

38:57.974 --> 39:00.241
So what'll you do?

39:00.276 --> 39:03.243
Pay, I guess.

39:03.278 --> 39:05.177
But not just yet.

39:05.212 --> 39:08.249
Let him sweat it out a little bit longer.

39:10.352 --> 39:12.185
My girl's here.

39:12.220 --> 39:14.321
But you know what? You should call her.

39:14.356 --> 39:16.842
- Henry's gonna need a new ear.
- Maybe I will.

39:16.905 --> 39:18.976
Same time next week, Elizabeth.

39:19.055 --> 39:21.495
- Hello, Laura.
- Hi, Marsha.

39:21.678 --> 39:23.524
- Hi, honey.
- Mom.

39:23.563 --> 39:26.767
So glad you could make it.

39:26.802 --> 39:28.468
You look lovely.

39:28.503 --> 39:29.804
Thanks.

39:33.976 --> 39:36.410
You know, it's customary in polite society

39:36.445 --> 39:39.980
to return the compliment.

39:40.015 --> 39:42.917
You look your age.

39:42.952 --> 39:44.923
Is that your professional opinion?

39:44.993 --> 39:47.921
It's the nicest thing I can say.

39:47.956 --> 39:49.909
Well, nothing wrong with that, right?

39:49.987 --> 39:51.365
It's part of the point, really.

39:51.451 --> 39:56.129
- Nothing to hide.
- You of all people.

39:56.164 --> 39:59.445
All right, we always seem
to get off on the wrong foot.

39:59.539 --> 40:01.697
I just wanted to know how everything is.

40:01.752 --> 40:05.605
What's going on in your life.

40:05.640 --> 40:08.075
Ben and I, um...

40:08.492 --> 40:11.245
we got the permit.

40:11.451 --> 40:13.046
We're gonna get pregnant.

40:13.081 --> 40:15.683
Well, that's fantastic.

40:15.718 --> 40:17.884
That's spectacular news.

40:17.919 --> 40:19.754
I'm gonna be a grandmother.

40:19.789 --> 40:23.658
It's too bad there won't
be a grandfather around.

40:23.693 --> 40:28.571
Laura, you know I miss your
father as much as you do.

40:28.642 --> 40:32.633
Right, but we're not
both equally responsible

40:32.668 --> 40:34.602
for his absence, are we?

40:37.539 --> 40:39.568
What? I thought you had nothing to hide.

40:39.646 --> 40:42.075
Well, maybe I do have something to hide.

40:42.110 --> 40:44.209
Maybe it's not just a coincidence

40:44.244 --> 40:46.169
that a junior executive
such as your husband

40:46.204 --> 40:49.984
would receive an approved permit so soon.

40:50.019 --> 40:52.881
- You didn't.
- Why not?

40:52.951 --> 40:55.087
You may not believe this,
but I care about you.

40:55.158 --> 40:58.986
God. You just cannot
help yourself, can you?

40:59.040 --> 41:01.861
You have to stick your fingers in
everything, make it all about you.

41:01.896 --> 41:03.298
I was just trying to help.

41:03.365 --> 41:05.866
I don't need your help.

41:05.901 --> 41:08.035
Mom, I am not a child.

41:08.136 --> 41:09.876
- I am an...
- An adult?

41:09.931 --> 41:11.370
Last time you were an independent adult,

41:11.394 --> 41:16.019
I received a piece of
my daughter in the mail.

41:16.064 --> 41:17.997
- And...
- You know what?

41:18.079 --> 41:20.289
This is my fault. It is, really.

41:20.352 --> 41:22.817
How could I expect it to go any other way?

41:22.852 --> 41:24.520
Laura. Laura, please.

41:29.959 --> 41:32.595
- Next.
- Next.

41:39.834 --> 41:42.237
Next.

41:47.510 --> 41:50.713
Next. Step up, sir.

41:57.419 --> 42:00.337
- Whoa!
- Everyone back!

42:02.191 --> 42:03.692
Please step out of the scanner, sir.

42:03.762 --> 42:04.956
Whoa, whoa, wait, wait, wait.

42:05.016 --> 42:07.050
Wait, there must be a mistake.

42:07.195 --> 42:10.296
- It's just...
- _.

42:10.331 --> 42:11.939
What is it? What does that mean?

42:11.987 --> 42:14.779
Excuse me...

42:14.856 --> 42:17.837
That's not... That's
not mine! That's not mine!

42:17.924 --> 42:19.211
Don't you understand? That's not...

42:19.235 --> 42:20.211
I've never seen that before!

42:20.246 --> 42:23.765
Sir. Sir. You can go now.

42:23.804 --> 42:26.339
- I didn't take that! No!
- _

42:26.421 --> 42:29.455
I've never seen that before! Please!

42:29.671 --> 42:33.208
No! It's not mine!

42:50.326 --> 42:53.814
Ben?

42:53.882 --> 42:57.885
You're home.

42:57.976 --> 43:02.278
Is everything okay?

43:02.383 --> 43:05.116
Chad got fired today.

43:05.177 --> 43:08.646
My God.

43:08.791 --> 43:11.192
He must be in the Quiet Room by now.

43:11.227 --> 43:14.530
What'll happen to his family?

43:17.233 --> 43:19.866
I'll talk to Elizabeth.

43:20.044 --> 43:24.381
She's not gonna help. You
don't know her like I do.

43:24.472 --> 43:27.599
She's family.

43:27.694 --> 43:29.795
No.

43:29.845 --> 43:32.912
You and me, right here,

43:33.002 --> 43:35.771
this is family.

43:44.025 --> 43:46.192
Good morning, ladies and gentlemen.

43:46.974 --> 43:48.582
Two days ago,

43:48.652 --> 43:52.467
we buried 14 loyal men and women.

43:54.582 --> 43:57.113
Yesterday we captured a rat.

43:57.176 --> 43:59.006
Hell of a week.

43:59.041 --> 44:04.780
It's heartbreaking to watch someone
bite the hand that feeds them.

44:04.815 --> 44:07.217
- Spiga is a generous mother.
- Thank you.

44:07.266 --> 44:11.035
It will feed you, dress you, protect you.

44:11.181 --> 44:13.114
In exchange,

44:13.149 --> 44:16.271
it only asks for hard work

44:16.314 --> 44:17.413
and loyalty.

44:19.719 --> 44:21.694
The alternative...

44:21.729 --> 44:25.733
well, we all know Mr. Peterson's fate.

44:27.735 --> 44:32.839
I'm afraid the stories you heard were true.

44:35.778 --> 44:39.625
The good news, for all you
ambitious young men and women,

44:39.677 --> 44:43.382
is that now we have an
opening on the 40th floor.

44:45.988 --> 44:49.937
This opening is an opportunity...

44:49.983 --> 44:52.818
- not just to serve this family,

44:52.994 --> 44:56.491
but to enjoy all the perks and privileges

44:56.598 --> 45:00.268
that come with a senior executive position.

45:02.677 --> 45:04.662
Ready?

45:04.732 --> 45:06.205
Give me a second.

45:14.582 --> 45:18.011
We'll soon start evaluating candidates.

45:18.067 --> 45:21.515
We live in troubled, uncertain times.

45:21.578 --> 45:27.488
So the vetting process will be
extremely thorough and rigorous.

45:27.528 --> 45:31.211
Those who have nothing to hide...

45:31.283 --> 45:34.853
have nothing to fear.

45:34.888 --> 45:37.521
Those who do should know...

45:37.747 --> 45:41.584
we will not let another
traitor slip through...

45:43.077 --> 45:44.714
not again.
