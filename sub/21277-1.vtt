- Are you gettin' hungry?

01:09.070 --> 01:09.835
Wanna a hot dog?

01:09.837 --> 01:11.070
- Yeah.

01:11.072 --> 01:12.237
- Okay.

01:13.139 --> 01:15.841
Right over here, sweetie.

01:15.843 --> 01:17.409
Stay close to me.

01:21.815 --> 01:26.085
Could I get just two hot
dogs, whatever you do to it.

01:27.353 --> 01:28.754
Stay here, okay?

01:30.490 --> 01:31.390
Thank you.

01:35.128 --> 01:35.794
All right, let's go
across the street

01:35.796 --> 01:37.362
and see that music guy.

01:59.586 --> 02:03.655
Okay, let's go this
way, get you some beads.

02:08.195 --> 02:09.895
Over here, baby.

02:09.896 --> 02:13.198
Do me a favor, I'm gonna
see how much these are.

02:13.200 --> 02:14.800
You hold this for me?

02:15.902 --> 02:17.169
Thank you.

02:34.420 --> 02:35.754
- Hi.

02:38.892 --> 02:40.225
- Hi.

02:41.361 --> 02:44.196
- You want
one of my hot dogs?

02:44.198 --> 02:48.167
- Well, that's very nice
of you, I'll be okay.

02:48.169 --> 02:49.168
- Will you?

02:50.603 --> 02:51.503
- Charlie!

02:52.639 --> 02:56.575
Charlie, I told you
not to leave my sight!

02:56.577 --> 02:58.377
- I was just
talking to this man.

02:58.379 --> 03:01.613
- No, don't look at that filth!

03:01.615 --> 03:03.615
Come on, you know
better than that.

03:07.955 --> 03:08.854
Charlie!

03:09.822 --> 03:11.890
- Hey, what's your name?

04:22.329 --> 04:24.630
- It's
been eight years.

04:24.632 --> 04:28.300
It's been eight years
since I last saw you.

04:29.402 --> 04:33.305
I can still see myself
in that parking garage,

04:33.307 --> 04:36.041
looking through my
rear view mirror,

04:36.043 --> 04:40.479
watching you drive away with
a family that isn't your own.

04:41.814 --> 04:46.385
I've never stopped thinking
about you, I never will.

04:46.387 --> 04:48.287
In some ways I feel
as though I never left

04:48.289 --> 04:51.290
that damn parking garage

04:51.292 --> 04:54.660
because that's where
i left my heart.

04:54.662 --> 04:58.597
But eventually I did leave
and just started driving west

04:58.599 --> 05:02.734
for no other reason than i
didn't know where else to go.

05:02.736 --> 05:05.804
I love you, grace,
you hold my heart.

05:07.440 --> 05:10.409
And I hope that one day
when you read the pages

05:10.411 --> 05:14.346
of this journal you could
know that I always loved you

05:14.348 --> 05:18.317
and I always wanted to be
your dad and I'm sorry.

05:19.686 --> 05:21.453
I'm so damn sorry.

05:22.055 --> 05:23.355
Love, Jim.

07:22.810 --> 07:24.075
Hey, excuse me.

07:24.077 --> 07:25.544
- Can I help
you with something?

07:25.546 --> 07:26.812
- Yeah, do you guys
sell journals here?

07:26.814 --> 07:28.447
- At the
end of the aisle.

07:31.752 --> 07:33.518
- Um, which aisle?

07:35.087 --> 07:37.489
- The one behind you.

07:38.491 --> 07:39.591
- Uh,

07:39.593 --> 07:43.228
they're all behind me,
there's like a billion of 'em.

07:43.230 --> 07:45.564
Which aisle is it?

07:45.566 --> 07:46.932
- Are you serious?

07:47.733 --> 07:49.201
- Oh, hey, what are you readin'?

07:49.203 --> 07:51.136
Is that, uh, is that a
book on customer service?

07:51.138 --> 07:53.705
Yes, I'm serious, which aisle?

07:55.541 --> 07:56.208
- That aisle.

07:56.210 --> 07:57.042
- Thank you.

07:57.044 --> 07:58.510
- You're welcome.

08:44.222 --> 08:45.624
- Hey, you ready to check out?

08:45.626 --> 08:48.026
- Yeah, hey, uh, this
book was, uh, left

08:48.028 --> 08:49.294
in the journal section.

08:49.296 --> 08:52.230
- People are always
doing this to me.

08:52.232 --> 08:54.566
They're always putting things
back where they don't belong,

08:54.568 --> 08:56.635
moving things around
without permission.

08:56.637 --> 08:57.936
How would you like it if i
came to your place of work

08:57.938 --> 09:00.005
and I started putting
things in different places?

09:00.007 --> 09:01.273
"Oh, you alphabetize things?

09:01.275 --> 09:05.577
"Let me put z with a,
oh, b, b goes with d."

09:05.579 --> 09:08.179
- Well, hey, that's why
they pay you the big bucks.

09:08.181 --> 09:10.181
- They don't pay me crap.

09:10.183 --> 09:14.286
- 'Scuse me, I've been looking
down that aisle you told me

09:14.288 --> 09:17.622
and I simply cannot
find that cookbook.

09:19.025 --> 09:21.593
- I took you right to it, it's
the third aisle on the right.

09:21.595 --> 09:24.296
- I looked there,
can you show me?

09:25.765 --> 09:28.767
- I physically touched the book.

09:28.769 --> 09:32.003
- I know, but then
you walked away,

09:32.005 --> 09:33.805
and I didn't see where
you were pointing.

09:33.807 --> 09:35.707
- I'll be right back.

09:38.145 --> 09:38.143
It's over here.

09:38.145 --> 09:44.182
- The ragamuffin
gospel by Brennan Manning.

09:44.184 --> 09:46.685
This book was written with
a specific reading audience

09:46.687 --> 09:48.086
in mind.

09:48.088 --> 09:50.989
This book wasn't written
for the super-spiritual

09:50.991 --> 09:53.825
or for those who live
only on the mountaintop

09:53.827 --> 09:58.597
and have never visited
the valley of desolation.

09:58.599 --> 10:00.365
It's not for the
complacent who hoist

10:00.367 --> 10:03.301
over their shoulders a tote
bag of honors, diplomas,

10:03.303 --> 10:07.606
and good works, actually
believing that they've made it.

10:07.608 --> 10:10.375
It's not for legalists who
would rather surrender control

10:10.377 --> 10:13.678
of their souls to rules
rather than run the risk

10:13.680 --> 10:15.347
of living in union with Jesus.

10:20.786 --> 10:24.689
This is a book for
the bedraggled, beat
up, and burnt out.

10:24.691 --> 10:24.689
For the sorely burdened

10:24.691 --> 10:27.726
who are still shifting
the heavy suitcase

10:27.728 --> 10:30.395
from one hand to another.

10:30.397 --> 10:30.395
For the wobbly and weak-kneed

10:30.397 --> 10:33.331
who know they don't
have it all together

10:33.333 --> 10:37.936
and are too proud to accept
the handout of amazing grace.

10:42.241 --> 10:44.309
For poor, weak,
sinful men and women

10:44.311 --> 10:47.746
with hereditary faults
and limited talents.

10:47.748 --> 10:49.414
This book is for the
bent and bruised who feel

10:49.416 --> 10:53.752
that their life is a grave
disappointment to god.

11:06.966 --> 11:08.767
Yes, sir?

11:08.769 --> 11:10.402
- You okay, son?

11:10.404 --> 11:12.270
- Yes, sir.

11:12.272 --> 11:14.806
- You know you
can't park here, right?

11:14.808 --> 11:16.441
- Yes, I, what's wro--

11:16.443 --> 11:18.943
sorry, sir, I'm just
waking up, where do you,

11:18.945 --> 11:20.812
where should I park?

11:20.814 --> 11:24.115
- I really don't care, just
not in the middle of my beach

11:24.117 --> 11:25.850
middle of the night.

11:31.424 --> 11:33.992
- Good
morning, lifegate church.

11:33.994 --> 11:35.360
- Yeah, is mark there?

11:35.362 --> 11:36.261
- Pastor mark?

11:36.263 --> 11:38.263
No, he's in San Diego.

11:38.265 --> 11:38.263
- He's in San Diego?

11:38.265 --> 11:41.766
- Uh, yes, sir,
he goes out there every year

11:41.768 --> 11:43.468
for an annual
pastor's conference.

11:43.470 --> 11:44.969
- That's right.

11:46.072 --> 11:49.274
Hey, do you know where
that's being held?

12:29.014 --> 12:31.850
- I need you to go to office
depot and get these laminated.

12:31.852 --> 12:33.318
I put it in the to-do
list and I need you

12:33.320 --> 12:35.086
to follow the directions.

12:35.088 --> 12:36.254
- Okay.

12:36.256 --> 12:37.856
- This is a big
moment for you, okay?

12:37.858 --> 12:39.190
And I need you to be there--
- hi, there, is this

12:39.192 --> 12:40.825
where the thing is?

12:40.827 --> 12:43.394
- Oh, absolutely, hello,
are you ready to check in?

12:43.396 --> 12:44.829
- Uh, yeah.

12:44.831 --> 12:45.897
- Okay,
well, it looks like

12:45.899 --> 12:47.899
somebody just rolled outta bed.

12:49.369 --> 12:50.802
- Somethin' like that.

12:50.804 --> 12:51.870
- Oh, we're
just jokin' with ya.

12:51.872 --> 12:51.870
- Okay.
- - All right.

12:51.872 --> 12:54.239
- So, what church
are you with, honey?

12:54.241 --> 12:55.206
- Uh,

12:55.208 --> 12:56.541
church?

12:56.543 --> 12:58.009
- Yeah, if they didn't put
you down by your church,

12:58.011 --> 12:59.444
they would've put you
down by your name,

12:59.446 --> 13:01.045
so you could just tell us that.

13:01.047 --> 13:02.881
Now, seriously, why are
you just sittin' here?

13:02.883 --> 13:02.881
I need you to be laminatin'.

13:02.883 --> 13:05.884
We got two hundred n--
- this is me right here.

13:05.886 --> 13:06.818
- Ryan brinson?
- - Yup.

13:06.820 --> 13:08.820
- I loved your books.

13:08.822 --> 13:08.820
They have changed my life.

13:08.822 --> 13:11.089
- Oh, well, I'm, uh, goo--
- we have a lanyard

13:11.091 --> 13:12.023
for you--
- yeah.

13:12.025 --> 13:12.957
- And you better get in

13:12.959 --> 13:14.125
because the first session--

13:14.127 --> 13:15.360
is about to fill up.

13:15.362 --> 13:16.494
- Uh, thank you, hey,
uh, quick question.

13:16.496 --> 13:16.494
I've never been here before.

13:16.496 --> 13:19.931
Is there a place I can
grab a smoke real quick?

13:19.933 --> 13:21.166
- Excuse me?

13:21.168 --> 13:23.201
- Before the sess-- do
i have time for a smoke?

13:27.841 --> 13:29.340
All right, later.

13:51.063 --> 13:54.465
Excuse
me, are you Brennan Manning?

13:54.467 --> 13:56.034
- Unfortunately, yes.

13:56.036 --> 13:57.602
- You wrote this book,
ragamuffin gospel?

13:57.604 --> 13:59.838
- A long time, look,
i, I'm, I'm busy.

13:59.840 --> 14:01.840
I'm going over my notes,
thank you very much, goodbye.

14:01.842 --> 14:03.241
- Oh, I'm sorry, i
just wanted to say

14:03.243 --> 14:04.209
you got a cool--
- how many ways

14:04.211 --> 14:05.410
do I have to tell you I'm busy?

14:05.412 --> 14:07.846
I'm going over my notes!

14:07.848 --> 14:11.316
- Sorry to bother you.
- What are you, deaf?

14:14.153 --> 14:17.488
- Tellin'
ya you had a cool book.

14:21.228 --> 14:22.527
- Thank you.

14:22.529 --> 14:27.632
Welcome to the 2005 San
Diego pastor's convention!

14:27.634 --> 14:30.034
Ah, thank you,

14:30.036 --> 14:31.970
give it up for the band.

14:33.540 --> 14:35.974
He's dedicated his life
to traveling the world

14:35.976 --> 14:37.909
and preaching the love of god

14:37.911 --> 14:39.510
as a vagabond evangelist.

14:39.512 --> 14:41.346
Please welcome, Brennan Manning.

14:48.153 --> 14:49.554
Brennan Manning.

14:55.929 --> 14:56.561
- Hmm?

14:56.563 --> 14:58.196
- You dropped this.

15:00.499 --> 15:02.000
- Okay, let's try
this one more time.

15:03.036 --> 15:04.435
Brennan Manning.

15:06.105 --> 15:07.472
Thank you.

15:13.379 --> 15:15.146
- In the words of
St. Francis of assisi

15:15.148 --> 15:19.050
to brother Dominic on
the way to umbria, "hi."

15:20.519 --> 15:23.955
I'd like to speak to what
response does god look for

15:23.957 --> 15:27.525
from us in return for
the gift of his love

15:28.694 --> 15:31.596
that knows no boundary,
limit, or breaking point.

15:31.598 --> 15:34.032
In 1982, the movie of the year

15:34.034 --> 15:37.268
that won the best Oscar
was chariots of fire.

15:37.270 --> 15:41.005
There was one scene in the
film that really grabbed me.

15:41.007 --> 15:43.675
The night before the
race she goes to him,

15:43.677 --> 15:47.178
in fact, she pleads with
him to drop out of the race,

15:47.180 --> 15:50.682
and he looks at her with
eyes of great compassion

15:50.684 --> 15:54.018
and in a gentle voice he says,

15:54.020 --> 15:56.120
"but, Mary, god made me fast,

15:56.122 --> 15:59.157
"and when I run i
feel his pleasure.

15:59.159 --> 16:00.692
"Do you understand Mary?

16:00.694 --> 16:03.594
"When I run I feel
his pleasure."

16:03.596 --> 16:06.064
The splendor of the human heart

16:06.066 --> 16:09.367
that trusts it is
loved unconditionally

16:10.736 --> 16:14.706
gives god more pleasure than
the westminster cathedral,

16:16.008 --> 16:19.744
Beethoven's ninth symphony,
Van gogh's sunflowers,

16:19.746 --> 16:23.281
the sight of ten thousand
butterflies in flight,

16:23.283 --> 16:26.684
or the scent of a
million orchids in bloom.

16:26.686 --> 16:31.122
Trust is our gift back to god
that he finds it so enchanting

16:33.025 --> 16:35.994
that Jesus died for love of it.

16:35.996 --> 16:39.197
In 1932, there was a
French philosopher.

16:40.599 --> 16:43.167
He tried to
interpret the Bible--

16:46.539 --> 16:47.739
- thank you.

17:00.652 --> 17:02.620
- What are you doin' here?

17:02.622 --> 17:04.722
- Hey, mark, how you doin' man?

17:04.723 --> 17:06.758
- I asked why you're here, man.

17:06.760 --> 17:08.393
- I live here.

17:08.395 --> 17:10.060
- I know, but here.

17:11.730 --> 17:12.630
- I, uh,

17:14.566 --> 17:17.402
I need your help,
i need your help.

17:17.404 --> 17:18.636
- I gotta catch a plane.

17:18.637 --> 17:22.140
- No, no, no, look,
come on, you know me.

17:22.142 --> 17:23.674
You know if I had
any other options,

17:23.675 --> 17:26.644
I wouldn't be asking you, but
i really need your help, man.

17:26.646 --> 17:31.049
I really need your
help, can you help me?

17:31.051 --> 17:34.152
- I'm takin' Sarah and the kid
across the street for lunch.

17:34.154 --> 17:35.586
Meet me there and we'll talk.

17:35.588 --> 17:36.421
- Okay.
- Yeah.

17:36.423 --> 17:37.255
- Thank you, sir.

17:47.700 --> 17:51.636
Hey, um, so,
hey, so sorry to interrupt.

17:51.638 --> 17:54.072
Uh, hey, man, I really
enjoyed your, uh, sermon.

17:54.074 --> 17:57.375
Uh, hey, this is maybe
stupid but do you wanna, um,

17:57.377 --> 17:59.177
wanna go grab a
beer or something?

17:59.179 --> 18:00.645
- That's
not a good question

18:00.647 --> 18:02.847
to ask a recovering alcoholic.

18:02.849 --> 18:04.549
- I, uh, sorry, i--
- and besides,

18:04.551 --> 18:06.184
I gotta get back to n'awlins.

18:06.186 --> 18:08.419
- Oh, hey, that's where
I'm from, New Orleans.

18:08.421 --> 18:10.521
- No, no, no, no, no, no,
if you're from n'awlins,

18:10.523 --> 18:12.156
you don't say New Orleans.

18:12.158 --> 18:14.358
You say n'awlins, or
else they'll kill ya.

18:14.360 --> 18:16.260
No, they will.
- That's funny.

18:16.262 --> 18:18.863
It's been a long time
since I lived there, so.

18:18.865 --> 18:20.131
Anyway, it was great
to meet you, sir.

18:20.133 --> 18:21.532
- Good.

18:21.534 --> 18:24.569
- All right,
take care, guys.

18:24.571 --> 18:26.204
- Great
job in there today.

18:26.206 --> 18:27.438
- Oh, thank you very
much, it was my pleasure.

18:27.440 --> 18:28.673
- All right, listen,

18:28.675 --> 18:29.474
I'm gonna go pull
the car around.

18:29.476 --> 18:30.408
- Okay, I'll wait here.

18:30.410 --> 18:31.476
- All right.

18:40.385 --> 18:42.220
- So, where do I sit?

18:43.322 --> 18:46.858
- Oh, I thought you
had a flight to catch.

18:46.860 --> 18:49.560
- I'll
catch a later one.

18:49.562 --> 18:51.229
- But won't your wife be mad?

18:51.231 --> 18:52.830
- Look, I'm a grumpy old man.

18:52.832 --> 18:55.133
I don't wanna change my mind.

18:55.135 --> 18:57.168
- Okay, okay, lemme
clear out some stuff.

19:02.775 --> 19:03.908
Uh, just I'll make
some room for you, sir.

19:08.213 --> 19:09.780
- Hey, don't go
without this, guy.

19:09.782 --> 19:10.748
Go ahead and grab that.

19:10.750 --> 19:12.183
- Oh, thank you very much.

19:12.185 --> 19:12.183
- You're welcome.
- I appreciate that.

19:12.185 --> 19:14.685
- Well, you might notice
it's a little heavier.

19:14.687 --> 19:16.354
I put some take homes in
there and, oh, some snacks.

19:16.356 --> 19:17.655
Do you, do you eat cheese?

19:17.657 --> 19:21.159
We'll talk about it, listen,
I'll go pull the car up?

19:21.161 --> 19:22.593
- Oh, no, I, I have a ride.

19:22.595 --> 19:24.262
- Oh, yeah.
- Thank you very,

19:24.264 --> 19:27.198
very much, I appreciate it.
- Yeah, hey, yeah, yeah.

19:27.200 --> 19:28.933
- Hey, I can take it,
i can take it for you.

19:28.935 --> 19:31.269
There you go, there you go,

19:31.271 --> 19:33.871
just get you right
in there, sir.

19:35.307 --> 19:38.209
Watch your head, I'm a
cop, no, just kidding.

19:38.211 --> 19:39.677
This back door doesn't open,

19:39.679 --> 19:41.779
so I'm just gonna go right
over your head, there,

19:41.781 --> 19:43.314
right over your head, sorry.

19:45.451 --> 19:46.951
Again, sorry about this door,

19:46.953 --> 19:48.252
just goin' right over your
head, right over your head,

19:48.254 --> 19:50.354
right over your head,
sorry about that.

19:50.356 --> 19:52.356
Okay, okay, and that.

19:53.759 --> 19:54.659
All right.

19:55.894 --> 19:55.893
Um,

19:57.796 --> 20:00.431
I don't know where my keys are.

20:02.201 --> 20:04.368
- Well, I don't
like preachers, either.

20:04.370 --> 20:06.704
- I mean that's not you.

20:06.706 --> 20:09.740
Well, I mean what I saw
in you is different.

20:09.742 --> 20:14.378
- The god of many christians
is too small for me.

20:14.380 --> 20:18.616
A god who loves me when I'm
good and hates me when I'm bad,

20:20.252 --> 20:24.889
a very fickle god
where everything
depends on my behavior,

20:24.891 --> 20:27.458
a god of moralism,
a god of legalism,

20:27.460 --> 20:30.962
a very heavy-handed god
of authoritarianism,

20:30.964 --> 20:33.965
and it's not the Jesus who said,

20:33.967 --> 20:36.701
"make your home in me
as I make mine in you."

20:36.703 --> 20:39.403
- Yeah, Jesus, I, i
have no problem with.

20:39.405 --> 20:42.707
It's the christians
that I can live without.

20:42.709 --> 20:44.008
- Who hurt you?

20:47.312 --> 20:49.280
- I've just had
enough, that's all.

20:49.282 --> 20:52.350
- How long have you
been living in your car?

20:52.352 --> 20:54.252
- I've been living in
my car a little while,

20:54.254 --> 20:56.587
I mean maybe eight months or so.

20:56.589 --> 20:58.322
I have friends i
stay at occasionally.

20:58.324 --> 21:01.325
I've met, I've made some
friends out here in San Diego,

21:01.327 --> 21:04.862
and I've been able to crash
on some couches and stuff and,

21:04.864 --> 21:08.633
but I mean longer
than it's comfortable,

21:08.635 --> 21:09.600
you know what I mean?

21:09.602 --> 21:11.702
Longer than it's comfortable.

21:11.704 --> 21:13.337
Well, you know what I figure?

21:13.339 --> 21:16.440
I figure it's better to be
alone than to be hurting people.

21:16.442 --> 21:19.644
- Do you believe god
loves you as you are,

21:19.646 --> 21:21.979
not as you should be?

21:26.318 --> 21:29.620
Because none of us
are as we should be.

21:31.690 --> 21:33.291
- I'm trying to.

21:34.993 --> 21:37.662
- Good, because
here's the revelation,

21:37.664 --> 21:39.730
bright as the evening star.

21:39.732 --> 21:41.799
Jesus comes for sinners,

21:42.901 --> 21:46.370
for those as outcast
as tax collectors

21:46.372 --> 21:50.408
and those caught up in squalid
choices and failed dreams.

21:52.511 --> 21:56.647
He comes for corporate
executives, street people,

21:56.649 --> 22:00.885
superstars, farmers,
hookers, addicts, IRS agents,

22:02.587 --> 22:06.557
aids victims, and even
used-car salesmen.

22:06.559 --> 22:09.360
Jesus not only talks
with these people,

22:09.362 --> 22:12.563
he dines with
them, with sinners,

22:12.565 --> 22:16.534
will raise the eyebrows
of religious bureaucrats

22:16.536 --> 22:19.704
who hold up the
robes, an insignia

22:19.706 --> 22:24.508
of their religious authority
to justify their condemnation

22:24.510 --> 22:28.746
of the truth and their rejection
of the gospel of grace.

22:35.354 --> 22:37.488
- You're still here.

22:37.490 --> 22:39.523
- I'll be right back, Brennan.

22:39.525 --> 22:40.791
So, where were you?

22:40.793 --> 22:42.393
I was waiting for
a couple of hours.

22:42.395 --> 22:43.461
- Yeah, w--
- you said we'd meet

22:43.463 --> 22:44.395
right over there.

22:44.397 --> 22:45.429
- Yeah, we didn't have time

22:45.431 --> 22:45.429
for lunch.
- You didn't have time?

22:45.431 --> 22:48.432
What are you talking about
you didn't have time?

22:48.434 --> 22:48.432
We were in the coffee shop.
- No, well, we had to pack,

22:48.434 --> 22:48.432
and then w--
- no, wait, wait, wait,

22:48.434 --> 22:51.535
what do you mean
you had to pack?

22:51.537 --> 22:52.503
You said you were in
a hurry for a flight.

22:52.505 --> 22:53.771
- Hi.
- Yeah, we are.

22:53.773 --> 22:54.605
- And now, it's, this
all sounds like cr--

22:54.607 --> 22:55.806
- it's not crap, son,

22:55.808 --> 22:56.874
we're in a hurry.
- I'm Sarah.

22:56.876 --> 22:58.676
- I'm sorry, Sarah.
- Jim.

22:58.678 --> 22:59.677
- This is Sarah's son--

22:59.679 --> 23:00.745
- our son.

23:00.747 --> 23:02.079
- Our son.
- Yeah.

23:02.081 --> 23:03.080
- I apologize.
- That's okay, that's okay.

23:03.082 --> 23:05.583
- It's our son, Jake.

23:05.585 --> 23:06.784
You know what?

23:06.786 --> 23:08.452
- We better get going.
- - Okay.

23:08.454 --> 23:10.421
- All right, so, uh, why
don't you meet me in the car

23:10.423 --> 23:11.856
and I'll be right
with you, all right?

23:11.858 --> 23:13.090
- Yeah, it was nice to meet you.

23:13.092 --> 23:14.425
- Yeah, you too.

23:14.427 --> 23:16.394
- Come on, baby, come on.

23:17.662 --> 23:20.531
- Don't you blame me
for your ruined life.

23:20.533 --> 23:22.400
You got no one to
blame but yourself.

23:22.402 --> 23:26.070
If you want my help, all
you gotta do is come back

23:26.072 --> 23:28.806
to New Orleans, come
back to the church,

23:28.808 --> 23:31.742
and apologize for what you did.

23:31.744 --> 23:32.643
Or not.

23:33.879 --> 23:36.180
It's all up to you, though.

23:42.053 --> 23:44.889
- What was that?

23:44.891 --> 23:47.491
- That was my dad.

23:47.493 --> 23:50.528
You'd like him, he's a preacher.

23:53.199 --> 23:54.765
- You didn't
have to come in with me.

23:54.767 --> 23:56.033
- Oh, I didn't mind.

23:56.035 --> 23:58.202
- Well, sorry to have
to rush off like this,

23:58.204 --> 23:59.804
but you take care, man.

23:59.806 --> 24:01.572
- Yeah, take care.

24:02.174 --> 24:03.073
- Jim,

24:04.743 --> 24:05.976
why did you want to
speak with me today?

24:05.978 --> 24:07.878
Now, honestly, I don't
mean to offend you,

24:07.880 --> 24:09.647
but you don't seem like the type

24:09.649 --> 24:13.150
that would wanna
chitchat about theology.

24:14.453 --> 24:16.887
- I don't know, i
just, need help.

24:18.223 --> 24:21.992
Um, I think I'm just at a point
in my life where I feel, um,

24:23.495 --> 24:25.563
stuck, and, uh, I don't,

24:28.467 --> 24:31.202
I don't know how to get unstuck.

24:32.637 --> 24:36.040
- Well, then, that's
what I'll pray for.

24:37.576 --> 24:38.642
- Take care.

24:41.247 --> 24:43.214
- 7 pm flight to New Orleans.

24:43.216 --> 24:43.214
- I'm sorry, but all flights

24:43.216 --> 24:46.517
out to New Orleans have been
canceled due to weather.

24:46.519 --> 24:48.786
- I was supposed
to be on the 5 pm!

24:48.788 --> 24:51.255
- And that was actually
the last flight out.

24:51.257 --> 24:53.257
- You don't understand,
i have to be home!

24:53.259 --> 24:54.792
There's nothing you can do?

24:54.794 --> 24:56.894
- Sir, there's actually
a large storm front

24:56.896 --> 24:58.596
that's headed for
the Gulf right now

24:58.598 --> 24:59.964
and unfortunately, all flights

24:59.966 --> 25:01.632
to that region
have been canceled.

25:01.634 --> 25:02.933
They're not gonna
schedule anymore

25:02.935 --> 25:04.134
until that weather passes.

25:04.136 --> 25:05.736
- Can you get me a
flight to another city

25:05.738 --> 25:07.905
and then I can drive
to New Orleans.

25:07.907 --> 25:10.541
- Well, unfortunately
any of the other cities

25:10.543 --> 25:13.110
I could get you into tonight
would actually be further

25:13.112 --> 25:16.614
from New Orleans than
here, so I'm sorry,

25:16.616 --> 25:18.249
but I really think
you'd get there faster

25:18.251 --> 25:20.618
by driving than waiting
for a flight out from here.

25:23.589 --> 25:27.525
- An attendant will help
you find your car outside.

25:27.527 --> 25:28.158
- Hi.

25:28.160 --> 25:29.894
- Oh, just one second.

25:29.896 --> 25:33.564
Borrow-a-car-rent-a-car,
this is Paul.

25:33.566 --> 25:35.266
I told you you're not
supposed to be calling me

25:35.268 --> 25:36.667
at work anymore.

25:38.003 --> 25:40.738
- Sir, I'm in a major
hurry, I need to get home.

25:40.740 --> 25:43.607
- Sir, I'm on a business call.

25:43.609 --> 25:45.943
You're being very rude.

25:45.945 --> 25:47.244
Go ahead, mom.

25:47.246 --> 25:50.648
- I swear I'm in the
twilight zone of idiots.

25:50.650 --> 25:52.683
- Mom, I have to hang up now.

25:52.685 --> 25:56.186
Okay, this old guy
is gonna die on me.

25:56.188 --> 25:58.556
All right, make it quick.

25:59.758 --> 26:03.027
You know I love you, okay, bye.

26:03.029 --> 26:04.228
How can I help you today?

26:04.230 --> 26:04.228
- I need to rent a car.

26:04.230 --> 26:08.999
- I was afraid you
were gonna say that, we're out.

26:09.001 --> 26:10.200
- Nothing?

26:10.202 --> 26:11.135
- They cleaned us out because

26:11.137 --> 26:12.870
of the cancellations back east.

26:12.872 --> 26:14.305
The lady before you
got the last one.

26:14.307 --> 26:15.739
Have you actually tried, though,

26:15.741 --> 26:17.141
going to the other
rental places?

26:17.143 --> 26:19.677
- I've tried everything!

26:28.821 --> 26:30.821
- What's his problem?

26:30.823 --> 26:33.624
Borrow-a-car-rent-a-car,
this is--

26:33.626 --> 26:35.926
no, I didn't hang up on you.

26:40.999 --> 26:41.832
- Jim!

26:49.809 --> 26:54.044
- Hey, kid, you
got another sleeping bag?

26:54.980 --> 26:57.281
- I do, but I'll be honest.

26:57.283 --> 27:00.651
I have no idea where.

27:00.653 --> 27:04.054
- I'm gonna be honest
with you, I need help.

27:04.056 --> 27:05.656
- What's up?

27:05.658 --> 27:08.859
- My flight's been
canceled, no rental cars,

27:08.861 --> 27:10.661
and I've got to get
back to n'awlins

27:10.663 --> 27:12.997
as fast as humanly possible.

27:12.999 --> 27:15.666
- Oh, man, why the rush?

27:15.668 --> 27:18.736
- I'm tryin' to
save my marriage.

27:18.738 --> 27:21.171
- Well, then, that's
what I'll pray for.

27:26.011 --> 27:30.681
I'm just kiddin', get in,
of course I'm take ya!

27:32.652 --> 27:33.817
- New Orleans is a
pretty far distance,

27:33.819 --> 27:35.119
I hope you don't mind, kid.

27:35.121 --> 27:37.321
- Oh, no, no, I'm
headed there anyway.

27:37.323 --> 27:37.321
- I know I said I'm in a hurry,

27:37.323 --> 27:40.391
but you don't have
to drive so fast.

27:40.393 --> 27:42.159
- Oh, don't worry,
I'm a safe driver.

27:42.161 --> 27:42.993
- Brake lights!

27:47.299 --> 27:50.167
Why ya driving like a maniac?

27:50.169 --> 27:51.669
- Hey,

27:51.671 --> 27:54.138
no one likes a backseat driver.

27:56.675 --> 27:59.276
Oh, here's that sleeping bag.

28:12.724 --> 28:14.892
Hey, we're actually not too
far from Arizona, I think we're

28:14.894 --> 28:15.826
making good time--
- good, I wanna get

28:15.828 --> 28:17.027
an early start in the morning.

28:17.029 --> 28:17.928
- Yeah.

28:18.763 --> 28:18.762
Uh oh, one bed.

28:22.434 --> 28:25.202
Sure hope my hand doesn't
end up between two pillows.

28:28.307 --> 28:30.941
Planes, trains and automobiles?

28:32.043 --> 28:33.177
It's a movie?

28:34.179 --> 28:35.112
- Why don't you run downstairs,

28:35.114 --> 28:36.380
get us a couple of sandwiches?

28:36.382 --> 28:37.715
Here, take this.

28:37.717 --> 28:38.849
- Okay, sure.

28:39.417 --> 28:40.250
- Yeah.

28:40.252 --> 28:41.151
- Um,

28:42.821 --> 28:44.154
yeah, I, uh,

28:44.156 --> 28:46.824
I guess I'll, uh, just
be right back, then.

28:46.826 --> 28:48.058
- No, no, take your time.

28:48.060 --> 28:49.860
I'd appreciate a
few minutes alone.

28:49.862 --> 28:51.762
- Oh, yeah, yeah,
sorry about that, of course.

28:51.764 --> 28:53.430
- No sorries, just go!

28:53.432 --> 28:57.868
- Okay, okay,
going.

28:58.470 --> 28:59.737
Was that enough time?

29:00.506 --> 29:01.772
I'm kidding.

29:04.042 --> 29:06.910
- It's gonna be a long car ride.

29:18.089 --> 29:21.191
- Roslyn, it's
me, say something.

29:21.193 --> 29:22.860
- Where are you?

29:22.862 --> 29:25.929
- Just outside of San Diego,
my flight was canceled.

29:25.931 --> 29:27.831
- Don't lie to me.

29:27.833 --> 29:29.533
I'm not lying.

29:29.535 --> 29:31.502
- I just went to pick you up.

29:31.504 --> 29:34.037
Your flight was on
time, you weren't on it.

29:34.039 --> 29:35.906
- Oh, that was my
original flight.

29:35.908 --> 29:38.542
There was this kid that needed
help, so I switched flights

29:38.544 --> 29:40.978
and we needed to talk.

29:40.980 --> 29:42.780
- When are you coming home?

29:42.782 --> 29:43.947
- A few days.

29:45.316 --> 29:47.050
- I'll see you then.

29:51.323 --> 29:53.857
- Hey, I'm back, sorry
it took me so long.

29:53.859 --> 29:56.426
They didn't have any
Mayo, so I'm like,

29:56.428 --> 29:58.829
"hey, dude, I'm a Mayo guy."

30:00.832 --> 30:04.835
- Thought I told you
i wanted to be alone.

30:04.837 --> 30:05.869
- You okay, man?

30:05.871 --> 30:07.905
I, I'm--

30:07.907 --> 30:11.074
- I just wanted to be
alone for a few minutes.

30:11.076 --> 30:12.442
- I thought you wanted
me to get the sandwiches.

30:12.444 --> 30:13.977
- Are you deaf or stupid?

30:13.979 --> 30:15.879
I just wanna be alone!

30:17.982 --> 30:20.818
- I'll, uh, I'll
leave you alone.

30:24.122 --> 30:28.458
Dear grace, I'm coming home.

30:28.460 --> 30:31.461
I haven't spoken or seen
anyone there in years,

30:31.463 --> 30:33.063
not even my cousin Dave.

30:33.065 --> 30:35.098
It's just been too painful,

30:35.100 --> 30:37.234
because everything
and everyone there

30:37.236 --> 30:39.436
just reminds me of what I lost.

30:39.438 --> 30:40.337
You.

30:41.472 --> 30:44.308
I'm traveling there with
this guy named Brennan

30:44.310 --> 30:47.044
who's a preacher, you know,
but not one like my father.

30:47.046 --> 30:50.314
He doesn't play games,
doesn't wear masks.

30:50.316 --> 30:52.616
Yeah, he's rough around the
edges, but you know what?

30:52.618 --> 30:56.053
What you see is what
you get and I like that.

30:56.055 --> 31:00.624
No one is perfect, yet so many
times I see so many people

31:00.626 --> 31:04.094
pretending to be something
they're not, especially folks

31:04.096 --> 31:08.465
that call themselves
christians, but not him.

31:08.467 --> 31:09.333
He's not like that.

31:15.240 --> 31:17.307
- Abba, I belong to you.

31:20.011 --> 31:21.912
I belong to you, abba.

31:24.549 --> 31:26.116
Forgive me, daddy.

31:27.652 --> 31:29.953
I belong to you, abba.

31:32.090 --> 31:33.490
Abba, ambush Jim

31:35.960 --> 31:38.929
so he can feel the
fury of your love.

31:40.465 --> 31:42.366
Abba, I belong to you.

31:44.669 --> 31:46.970
I belong to you, abba.

31:58.951 --> 32:00.517
- Wake up, sleepyhead.

32:01.487 --> 32:02.653
Got you some coffee.

32:02.655 --> 32:04.655
- Morning, thank you.

32:05.990 --> 32:08.625
Mm, nothing like
motel coffee, right?

32:08.627 --> 32:11.962
- I'm sorry about last
night, I just, you know.

32:11.964 --> 32:15.632
- Ah, it's okay, no
sorries, remember?

32:15.634 --> 32:18.101
- Hey, we gotta get an early
start and get outta here.

32:18.103 --> 32:21.605
I got a million stops to make,
so I'll meet you downstairs.

32:21.607 --> 32:23.540
- Where are we going?

32:23.542 --> 32:27.411
Let me just finish
my brown water first.

32:27.413 --> 32:31.648
Not gonna
do it, nope, no way.

32:32.951 --> 32:35.519
- Take the right turn
at the next corner.

32:35.521 --> 32:37.254
- All, right,
where are we goin'?

32:37.256 --> 32:38.689
- A friend's.

32:48.133 --> 32:49.599
Andrea!

32:49.601 --> 32:51.702
Wow are you grown up, oh my.

32:51.704 --> 32:54.304
- Oh, thank you for
coming, he was asking for you.

32:54.306 --> 32:57.107
- Oh, sure, and this
is my friend, Jim.

32:57.109 --> 32:58.642
- Hi, hi.
- Hi, Andrea.

32:58.644 --> 32:59.977
- Hi, I'm Jim.

32:59.979 --> 33:02.245
- Come in, this way.

33:04.182 --> 33:06.083
Uh, Jim, can I get you
something to drink?

33:06.085 --> 33:08.151
- Oh, no, that's
nice of you, I'm okay.

33:08.153 --> 33:09.319
- Oh.

33:09.321 --> 33:12.022
- You have a
very lovely place here.

33:12.024 --> 33:13.623
- Thank you.

33:13.625 --> 33:16.026
Uh, please, uh, have a seat.

33:17.628 --> 33:18.528
- Hi, Joe.

33:19.664 --> 33:21.231
- Padre, you came.

33:23.034 --> 33:27.404
- I thought you were expecting
me, I saw the empty chair.

33:27.406 --> 33:29.639
- You were one of the best

33:31.009 --> 33:33.110
of our parish, father,

33:34.412 --> 33:34.411
so kind.

33:36.447 --> 33:39.082
Always so kind with my familia.

33:40.718 --> 33:44.287
I was always so sorry
what happens to you.

33:46.424 --> 33:49.326
Would you mind closing the door?

33:49.328 --> 33:52.029
- The door's
already closed, Joe.

33:52.031 --> 33:53.030
- So, how
do you know him?

33:53.032 --> 33:54.464
How do you know father Manning?

33:54.466 --> 33:57.434
- Oh, father mann-- i
forget, yeah, that's right,

33:57.436 --> 33:59.803
that's he's, he's a,
was a priest, right?

33:59.805 --> 34:02.172
- Well, a long
time ago, when I was small,

34:02.174 --> 34:04.775
you know, he was in my
church in Brooklyn and--

34:04.777 --> 34:06.143
- so he's not a priest anymore?

34:06.145 --> 34:07.377
- Oh,
it's a long story.

34:07.379 --> 34:09.079
You have to ask him
about it one day.

34:09.081 --> 34:12.349
- Oh, if I remem--yeah, oh,
i will do that, I'll do that.

34:12.351 --> 34:14.251
- So, you guys are just

34:14.253 --> 34:15.485
together now?
- Yeah, uh,

34:15.487 --> 34:18.621
I mean three days ago i
never heard of the guy

34:18.623 --> 34:21.491
and then I read his book
and now I'm here, so.

34:21.493 --> 34:23.560
- Three
days ago, wow.

34:23.562 --> 34:25.795
Well, that sounds like
something he would do.

34:25.797 --> 34:27.764
- How so?

34:27.766 --> 34:31.802
- Oh, you know, he's,
he's unpredictable.

34:31.804 --> 34:34.804
You know, they say that
people who follow the spirit,

34:34.806 --> 34:37.674
they're, they're like the wind.

34:39.077 --> 34:42.813
He's a vagabond, you never
know where he's coming from

34:42.815 --> 34:44.547
or where he's going.

34:45.850 --> 34:45.849
- Mama, mama!

34:48.387 --> 34:50.821
- Mindy!

34:50.822 --> 34:52.856
This is mindy, this is Jim.

34:52.858 --> 34:54.291
- Hi, mindy.

34:54.293 --> 34:57.327
- Do you have any kids?

34:57.329 --> 34:59.496
- Uh, no, I don't.

34:59.498 --> 35:01.164
- You should,

35:01.166 --> 35:04.801
it's the best thing that
ever happened to me.

35:06.871 --> 35:11.308
- I never say to anyone
this, no even my daughter.

35:12.577 --> 35:15.212
I have never known how to pray,

35:16.147 --> 35:17.214
but one day,

35:19.450 --> 35:21.184
a friend said to me,

35:22.320 --> 35:26.223
"Joe, you put an empty
chair in front of you

35:27.525 --> 35:31.128
"and in faith you see
Jesus in the chair

35:33.231 --> 35:37.501
"and you talk to him and
listen like you're doing

35:37.503 --> 35:39.236
"with me right now."

35:40.538 --> 35:41.438
I try

35:43.174 --> 35:45.876
and I like it so
much I'm doin' it

35:47.512 --> 35:49.646
a couple hours every day.

35:50.815 --> 35:52.215
But I'm careful.

35:54.218 --> 35:56.453
If my daughter sees me talking

35:56.455 --> 36:01.158
with an empty chair, she will
send me to the loony bin.

36:04.629 --> 36:06.796
- May I pray for you, Joe?

36:08.399 --> 36:09.900
You've reached Brennan.

36:09.902 --> 36:12.169
- And roslyn, leave
a message after the beep.

36:12.171 --> 36:14.871
- And
we'll get back to you as--

36:14.873 --> 36:14.871
- any luck?

36:14.873 --> 36:19.176
- No, she must be
at Sunday mass.

36:19.178 --> 36:20.944
- So, you used to
be a priest, right?

36:20.946 --> 36:22.779
- Yes.

36:22.781 --> 36:23.813
- But you're not anymore?

36:23.815 --> 36:25.415
- No.

36:25.417 --> 36:27.450
- What happened?

36:27.452 --> 36:28.852
- I met a girl.

36:39.530 --> 36:41.264
- What are
you doin' here?

36:41.266 --> 36:43.967
- Well, we were driving by
and I remembered you were here

36:43.969 --> 36:46.436
and I thought I'd
stop by, say hello,

36:46.438 --> 36:48.505
and introduce you
to my friend, Jim.

36:48.507 --> 36:49.940
- Hi, Jim English.

36:49.942 --> 36:52.676
- Yeah, hi, Jim, Ryan
brinson, how you doin'?

36:52.678 --> 36:53.977
- Your name's Ryan brinson?

36:53.979 --> 36:57.814
- Yeah.

36:57.816 --> 36:59.216
What?

37:03.222 --> 37:04.955
- Brennan, lemme
ask you somethin'.

37:04.957 --> 37:06.323
Why do you think
there are so many

37:06.325 --> 37:09.859
judgmental Christian
assholes out there?

37:09.861 --> 37:11.995
- Well, judgmental people

37:13.231 --> 37:16.333
have never been
broken themselves.

37:18.302 --> 37:19.436
My wife roslyn,

37:21.439 --> 37:23.974
she was married once before me.

37:23.976 --> 37:28.511
When she got a divorce, her
best friend, a devout Christian,

37:28.513 --> 37:30.313
wouldn't talk to her.

37:32.383 --> 37:37.354
Several years later, when
she, herself, got a divorce,

37:37.356 --> 37:40.890
she called roslyn and
asked for forgiveness.

37:43.794 --> 37:46.529
Christianity isn't a moral code.

37:47.632 --> 37:49.299
It's a love affair.

37:50.334 --> 37:51.401
- Nailed it.

37:54.372 --> 37:55.839
- What's that?

37:55.841 --> 37:56.806
- Pound it.

37:58.676 --> 38:00.310
- Oh.

38:00.312 --> 38:03.280
What brought you so many
miles from home to San Diego?

38:06.285 --> 38:10.320
- Guess I just didn't feel
like it was home anymore.

38:10.322 --> 38:12.022
- You mind if I take a nap?

38:12.024 --> 38:15.392
- Oh, yeah, I forgot,
old people need naps.

38:15.394 --> 38:16.893
- What?

38:17.728 --> 38:18.662
- I'm sorry, did I, are we not

38:18.664 --> 38:19.896
to the point in our friendship

38:19.898 --> 38:21.064
where we can joke
with each other?

38:21.066 --> 38:24.067
I didn't mean to offend
you, I'm so sorry.

38:24.069 --> 38:25.902
Get all the rest you can get.

38:25.904 --> 38:28.672
I love naps, personally,
i take them all the time.

38:28.674 --> 38:31.941
In fact I had a, I had a big
nap the other day, well I thi--

38:31.943 --> 38:33.376
I slept so long it
was like eight hours.

38:33.378 --> 38:35.312
Well, then, technically
it was called sleep,

38:35.314 --> 38:37.347
- but I love naps.
- - Jim, Jim!

38:37.349 --> 38:38.448
Shh!

38:39.417 --> 38:40.317
- Sorry.

38:55.066 --> 38:56.066
- Shh!

38:56.068 --> 38:58.101
- What, hey, what?

38:58.103 --> 38:59.002
- You were snoring.

38:59.004 --> 39:00.337
- I don't snore!

39:00.339 --> 39:02.539
- Oh, baby, you snore.

39:02.541 --> 39:03.373
Bad!
- No, I don't sn--

39:03.375 --> 39:05.108
I don't snore.

39:05.110 --> 39:07.377
And I'm gonna show
you I don't snore.

39:07.379 --> 39:08.578
I don't snore, no, I don't.
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

39:08.580 --> 39:10.013
- I don't--
- no, no, no, no,

39:10.015 --> 39:11.715
I hate to be tickled,

39:11.717 --> 39:12.816
- you know that!
- - I know.

39:12.818 --> 39:14.584
- Stop it, stop it!

39:14.586 --> 39:15.685
- I don't snore!

39:15.687 --> 39:19.456
I don't snore, mwah!

39:20.624 --> 39:24.127
- Nobody makes me
laugh more than you do.

39:26.665 --> 39:28.765
And nobody makes me more sad.

39:30.969 --> 39:34.037
- Jim, give me one
of those, please.

39:35.539 --> 39:38.575
Stop at the next hotel
or motel you see, okay?

39:38.577 --> 39:39.776
- I thought you
wanted to keep driving.

39:39.778 --> 39:41.378
- I, I need to
make a phone call.

39:41.380 --> 39:43.580
And, and we need
some rest, anyway.

39:43.582 --> 39:45.081
You've reached Brennan.

39:45.083 --> 39:47.417
- And roslyn, leave
a message after the beep.

39:47.419 --> 39:48.618
- And
we'll get back to you

39:48.620 --> 39:50.053
as soon as we can.

39:50.889 --> 39:53.156
- Hello, roz, it's me.

39:53.158 --> 39:56.559
I'm calling from
someplace in new Mexico.

39:56.561 --> 39:58.495
You can reach me at the hotel--

39:58.497 --> 40:00.497
- no, uh, te-- give
her my cell number.

40:02.467 --> 40:03.767
- Uh, I miss you.

40:04.635 --> 40:07.036
- Oh, baby, I miss you, too.

40:08.572 --> 40:10.073
- Are you allowed
to smoke in here?

40:10.075 --> 40:11.541
- I have no idea.

40:13.677 --> 40:15.678
- I love you.

40:19.985 --> 40:22.519
- Do you
wanna play some cards?

40:22.521 --> 40:23.753
- No.

40:23.755 --> 40:27.457
- I'm a big cards
guy; My grandma, um,

40:27.459 --> 40:29.759
she taught all us kids,
all of us cousins,

40:29.761 --> 40:30.693
to play cards when
we were younger.

40:30.695 --> 40:31.895
She was this big card shark.

40:31.897 --> 40:33.530
Her, like, brothers
taught her how to play.

40:33.532 --> 40:35.465
Anyway, so when we were
younger, we'd go to her house

40:35.467 --> 40:38.668
and one of my favorite memories
is we'd surround ourselves

40:38.670 --> 40:40.069
around the kitchen table
and she'd be there,

40:40.071 --> 40:41.504
she'd be super-sweet, right?

40:41.506 --> 40:41.504
And she'd be like,
she'd be like,

40:41.506 --> 40:44.207
"hey, you guys wanna
play some cards?"

40:44.209 --> 40:46.976
Right, and we're like, you
know, tryin' to be nice, right?

40:46.978 --> 40:49.112
Be like, "sure, grandma,
we'd love to play cards."

40:49.114 --> 40:50.880
And then all of a sudden
she'd turn and go,

40:50.882 --> 40:55.518
"good, all right, how much
money you got on you, kid?"

40:55.520 --> 40:56.886
That's my grandma.

41:00.524 --> 41:00.523
So, cards?

41:00.525 --> 41:04.661
- How many ways do i
have to tell it to you?

41:04.663 --> 41:06.996
I do not wish to play cards.

41:09.900 --> 41:12.735
- I'll just watch
some TV or something.

41:12.737 --> 41:14.504
Oh, readings good.

41:17.575 --> 41:21.177
Those gideons sure do make a
good Bible, huh?

41:21.179 --> 41:21.177
- Has anyone ever told you

41:21.179 --> 41:26.182
that you don't pick up
on social cues too well?

41:28.018 --> 41:29.919
- Sorry, I was
just tryin' to make chitchat.

41:29.921 --> 41:31.754
- I don't wanna chitchat.

41:31.756 --> 41:33.857
I don't wanna play cards.

41:33.859 --> 41:37.894
I don't wanna hear you ramble
on about random thoughts

41:37.896 --> 41:40.163
that enter your feeble brain

41:40.165 --> 41:42.665
because you don't have
the ability to refrain,

41:42.667 --> 41:45.034
or the competency to understand,

41:45.036 --> 41:49.272
that nobody gives a damn
about what you have to say!

41:53.110 --> 41:55.545
- Look, I'll leave
but you don't have

41:55.547 --> 41:56.746
to make me feel stupid about it.

41:56.748 --> 41:58.081
You're the one
that invited me in.

41:58.083 --> 42:00.517
- Well, now I'm uninviting you.

42:00.519 --> 42:01.818
- For good?

42:01.820 --> 42:05.522
- Yeah, for good, I'll
find another way home.

42:05.524 --> 42:06.656
- You better do that.

42:18.802 --> 42:20.303
You've reached Brennan.

42:20.305 --> 42:22.605
- And roslyn, leave
a message after the beep.

43:21.666 --> 43:22.932
Brennan, they took it,

43:22.934 --> 43:24.000
they took my journal.

43:24.002 --> 43:25.602
They took my journal.

43:28.373 --> 43:30.840
They took it, they took
my journal, Brennan,

43:30.842 --> 43:34.744
they took my journal,
it had my letters in it.

43:36.814 --> 43:38.881
It had my letters in it.

43:40.250 --> 43:44.053
It had my letters, it had
my letters to Gracie in it.

43:44.055 --> 43:45.321
It had my letters in it.

43:46.291 --> 43:48.024
I had these letters.

43:49.660 --> 43:51.728
I had all these letters.

43:52.630 --> 43:54.163
They stole my letters.

43:54.165 --> 43:57.634
They stole my
letters to this girl.

43:57.636 --> 43:59.936
They stole the
letters to my girl.

43:59.938 --> 44:01.838
They stole my letters.

44:03.273 --> 44:04.941
It had everything in there.

44:04.943 --> 44:07.176
It had everything in there.

44:08.145 --> 44:09.846
But now she won't know.

44:12.283 --> 44:15.351
Now she won't know
that I loved her.

44:16.420 --> 44:18.955
And I love her so much,
i love her so much.

44:18.957 --> 44:23.359
I love her so much, i
think about her every day.

44:23.361 --> 44:25.395
I think abou-- I can't
stop thinkin' about her.

44:25.397 --> 44:26.829
She's my girl.

44:28.999 --> 44:32.101
I just think about
her every day.

44:32.103 --> 44:33.436
I think about her every day,

44:33.438 --> 44:35.004
I just want her to know that i--

44:35.006 --> 44:37.707
I just want her to
know that I love her.

44:37.709 --> 44:39.976
I want her to know
that I love her so bad.

44:39.978 --> 44:41.811
That's why I write
to her every day.

44:41.813 --> 44:43.446
I write to her every day.

44:43.448 --> 44:46.282
And the days that I don't
write to her I feel like cr-

44:46.284 --> 44:47.850
I feel like I wanna die.

44:47.852 --> 44:50.219
I don't care what
anybody thinks about me!

44:50.221 --> 44:52.789
I don't care what
anybody thinks about me.

44:52.791 --> 44:56.359
I just want my girl, I just
want her to know I love her.

44:56.361 --> 45:00.063
I just want her to
know I love her.

45:00.065 --> 45:02.832
And I can't, I can't
go see her, I can't.

45:02.834 --> 45:05.068
I wanna go see her so bad.

45:05.070 --> 45:07.103
It's like people think that
i don't wanna go see her

45:07.105 --> 45:10.740
and it's like she's
everything to me.

45:10.742 --> 45:12.742
But I just can't do it.

45:12.744 --> 45:15.912
I want her, I want her back.

45:15.914 --> 45:18.715
And I know I'm crazy,
i know I'm crazy.

45:18.717 --> 45:21.818
I know it, I know it and
i hate how I feel inside.

45:21.820 --> 45:25.021
I hate how I, i
don't like myself!

45:25.023 --> 45:27.990
I hate myself for what I did.

45:27.992 --> 45:31.928
I hate that I destroyed my,
my life and everybody's life

45:31.930 --> 45:35.832
that comes into contact with
me, I don't like myself!

45:35.834 --> 45:40.403
I hate, I wanna kill
myself, I wanna kill myself.

45:40.405 --> 45:42.972
I don't wanna be here anymore.

45:45.509 --> 45:48.144
I don't wanna be here
anymore without her, Brennan.

45:48.146 --> 45:51.814
I don't wanna be here
anymore without her.

45:51.816 --> 45:55.752
I'd do anything to get
her back and I can't.

46:01.425 --> 46:03.993
- What was her name?

46:04.762 --> 46:05.828
- Grace.

46:08.232 --> 46:09.799
She's my daughter.

46:22.312 --> 46:24.313
- Blackjack, you in?

46:55.512 --> 46:59.382
- I mean I think in
the beginning it was,

46:59.384 --> 47:01.551
we wanted to do what
was best for her

47:01.553 --> 47:04.153
versus what was best for us.

47:05.856 --> 47:08.057
But no one could've prepared
me for the living hell

47:08.059 --> 47:10.126
that it would be to wake up

47:10.128 --> 47:12.995
and not have her in
my life, you know?

47:12.997 --> 47:15.464
And I wanna be her dad,
i, I wish I was her dad,

47:15.466 --> 47:18.568
and, and, and the reality
is that I'll never be that.

47:18.570 --> 47:21.103
I'll never be her dad and,
and there's no goin' back,

47:21.105 --> 47:22.839
you know what I mean?

47:22.841 --> 47:24.373
- At least you are still
in each other's lives,

47:24.375 --> 47:26.108
so that's wonderful.

47:30.314 --> 47:32.048
- You want another
cup of coffee?

47:32.050 --> 47:32.982
- Yeah.

47:32.984 --> 47:33.983
- All right, I'll be right back.

47:39.890 --> 47:41.224
Roslyn?

47:41.226 --> 47:42.458
- This is Andrea.

47:42.460 --> 47:44.894
I got this number
from father Brennan.

47:44.896 --> 47:46.128
- Oh, oh, this is Brennan.

47:46.130 --> 47:49.298
- It's my
father, he's gone.

47:52.936 --> 47:54.036
- Oh, did,

47:55.272 --> 47:57.139
did he seem to die in peace?

47:57.141 --> 47:58.040
- Yes,

47:59.476 --> 48:02.645
yes he did, but there
was something strange.

48:02.647 --> 48:04.380
- What?

48:04.382 --> 48:08.484
- Just before he died,
he was so strange.

48:08.486 --> 48:11.554
I saw him there with his head

48:11.556 --> 48:13.990
just resting on the chair.

48:15.559 --> 48:19.996
Thank you for talking to me, i
just thought you should know.

48:35.178 --> 48:36.312
- Joe's dead.

48:38.949 --> 48:40.416
- Oh, I'm so sorry.

48:43.287 --> 48:44.954
What are you doin'?

48:52.397 --> 48:53.963
What are you doin'?

48:53.965 --> 48:56.098
- Come on in,
don't be a fuddy-duddy!

48:56.100 --> 48:57.266
- I'm not gettin' in there,

48:57.268 --> 48:58.200
we don't on--
- come on!

48:58.202 --> 48:59.435
- We don't have on swimsuits!

48:59.437 --> 49:01.203
- Come
on, live a little!

49:01.205 --> 49:03.973
No, scratch that, live a lot!

49:03.975 --> 49:05.174
Life is short and
getting shorter

49:05.176 --> 49:06.676
and I'm gonna live
every second of it!

49:06.678 --> 49:06.676
- You're actin'
like a little kid!

49:06.678 --> 49:10.579
- That's the best compliment
anybody's ever paid me!

49:12.016 --> 49:13.115
- Brennan, you need
to grow up, all right?

49:13.117 --> 49:14.583
I'm not gettin' in there!

49:14.585 --> 49:16.585
- Come on, Jim--
- no! You're a child!

49:16.587 --> 49:18.955
- Come on!
- You're a child, grow up!

49:18.957 --> 49:21.157
- I said grow up, ah!
- - Hey, yeah!

49:24.262 --> 49:26.395
Atta-boy!

49:26.397 --> 49:27.630
- Oh, it went up my nose!

49:29.734 --> 49:29.732
- Yeah,
yeah, yeah, come on.

50:02.632 --> 50:05.234
In late 19th
century New Orleans,

50:05.236 --> 50:09.105
they didn't use the term
born again or saved.

50:09.107 --> 50:13.342
They said you were seized by
the power of great affection.

50:17.014 --> 50:18.481
- Well, I was, uh,
seven years old

50:18.483 --> 50:20.583
when I went to this church
camp

50:20.585 --> 50:21.784
and that's where i
decided to follow Jesus.

50:21.786 --> 50:23.219
I remember it specifically

50:23.221 --> 50:25.354
because that was
also the same year

50:25.356 --> 50:28.057
that I, um, wet my bunk bed.

50:29.560 --> 50:30.793
And all the guys in the cabin
told the whole camp, right?

50:30.795 --> 50:33.562
So, they were
torturing me all week.

50:33.564 --> 50:35.331
Yes, it was the best of times

50:35.333 --> 50:37.633
and the worst of
times, as they say.

50:37.635 --> 50:39.068
That's dickens.

50:39.070 --> 50:41.070
- I know, tale of two cities.

50:41.072 --> 50:42.271
- Well, I'm glad you
know, I don't know how to read.

50:42.273 --> 50:43.739
- Well, I can believe that.

50:45.610 --> 50:48.044
- So, you were a monk?

50:48.046 --> 50:50.079
- I guess you can say that, uh,

50:50.081 --> 50:52.214
they were known as the
little brothers of Jesus.

50:52.216 --> 50:54.050
- Mm-hmm.
- We lived in a

50:54.052 --> 50:55.317
small town in France.

50:55.319 --> 50:56.786
- Oh, wow, France?
- Dedicated our lives

50:56.788 --> 50:59.355
to live amongst the poor.

50:59.357 --> 51:02.825
- That's cool, so, I gotta
ask, why the potato sacks?

51:02.827 --> 51:04.293
- Potato sacks?

51:04.295 --> 51:05.561
- Yeah, that's what
monks wear, right?

51:05.563 --> 51:05.561
I mean I've never
met a monk before.

51:05.563 --> 51:09.098
That's what you guys
wear, right, potato sacks?

51:09.100 --> 51:12.201
- Jim, I have to ask you this.

51:12.203 --> 51:14.703
Have you ever had an IQ test?

51:48.205 --> 51:50.139
- I wanna tell you
something I have,

51:50.141 --> 51:52.475
I haven't told anybody yet.

51:52.477 --> 51:54.743
I've never gone to
see my daughter.

51:54.745 --> 51:55.644
- Why not?

51:57.247 --> 52:00.316
- Honestly, I don't even know
how to answer that question.

52:00.318 --> 52:03.619
- So you're punishing yourself?

52:03.621 --> 52:07.456
- Yeah, you're damn
right I am, I deserve it.

52:07.458 --> 52:10.259
- So, where does this come from?

52:10.261 --> 52:12.795
Is that what you
meant by being stuck?

52:12.797 --> 52:14.497
- I wanna be with her so bad.

52:14.499 --> 52:17.299
She's my little
girl, but I just,

52:18.568 --> 52:19.468
I just,

52:21.538 --> 52:24.206
I just can, I just can't.

52:24.208 --> 52:25.875
- Look, stop the car.

52:25.877 --> 52:26.809
- What?

52:26.811 --> 52:28.344
- Stop the car and get out!

52:32.849 --> 52:34.450
Out, out, get out.

52:34.452 --> 52:35.684
Get over here!

52:37.420 --> 52:41.524
If you could only
comprehend a mere fraction

52:41.526 --> 52:43.926
of the love of god for you.

52:43.928 --> 52:47.763
Not in some vague way that he
loves the whole human race,

52:47.765 --> 52:49.899
but he loves you in such a way

52:49.901 --> 52:52.868
that he'd rather die
than be without you!

52:52.870 --> 52:56.505
When you scorn yourself, then
you scorn all those plans

52:56.507 --> 53:00.476
of his, and all the
hope he placed in you.

53:00.478 --> 53:02.211
Do you get it, kid?

53:02.213 --> 53:04.880
And when you're brave enough
to let our god's reckless

53:04.882 --> 53:09.752
and furious love run rampant
and wreak havoc in your life,

53:09.754 --> 53:13.222
you won't delay in
going to see your kid.

53:14.624 --> 53:17.860
Because your identity will be
clothed in your father's love,

53:17.862 --> 53:19.895
not in your past.

53:19.897 --> 53:19.895
Got it, kid?

53:19.897 --> 53:23.299
Look, I gotta get
home, get in the car.

54:31.836 --> 54:33.269
- You nervous?

54:33.271 --> 54:33.269
- Hell yeah.

54:35.672 --> 54:38.674
- All right then,
what's your plan?

54:42.345 --> 54:44.446
- To get my wife back.

54:45.415 --> 54:47.316
You know, you're
welcome to stay.

54:47.318 --> 54:49.051
- Oh, no, no,
no, I got a place.

54:49.053 --> 54:49.051
Here, take your bag.

54:49.053 --> 54:53.756
- Well, if you change your
mind my door is always open.

54:53.758 --> 54:55.491
- I appreciate that.

54:56.860 --> 55:00.062
- You know, as my good friend
rich mullins always said,

55:00.064 --> 55:03.799
"be good, but you
probably won't be.

55:03.801 --> 55:05.034
"So be god's."

55:06.569 --> 55:06.568
Ai-yi.

55:09.339 --> 55:11.874
- Jeez, old people take forever.

55:39.503 --> 55:41.337
- What do you want?

55:41.339 --> 55:42.838
I don't know why I'm askin',
i know what you want.

55:42.840 --> 55:44.540
- Yeah, leave the bottle.

55:44.542 --> 55:46.608
- Pretty sure they
only do that in movies.

55:46.610 --> 55:47.876
Westerns, I think.

55:52.850 --> 55:54.917
Five nine bar and grill.

55:56.686 --> 55:58.087
Yeah, he's here.

55:59.723 --> 56:00.956
Brennan?

56:00.958 --> 56:02.091
It's for you.

56:03.426 --> 56:04.993
- This is Brennan.

56:07.764 --> 56:11.734
- You broke my heart
for the last time.

56:11.736 --> 56:12.835
- Roslyn?

56:12.837 --> 56:14.670
- I just called to say goodbye.

56:14.672 --> 56:17.506
- No, no, no, wait,
I'm on my way home.

56:17.508 --> 56:21.143
- Why wouldn't you
come here first?

56:21.145 --> 56:23.445
- Well, thi-- this place
was on my ride's way home.

56:23.447 --> 56:24.747
We just stopped
off for a second.

56:24.749 --> 56:25.814
I'm on my way home,

56:25.816 --> 56:27.816
don't go.
- Are you lying to me?

56:27.818 --> 56:31.387
- No, roz, just wait, i
love you, I'm on my way.

56:31.389 --> 56:33.422
- I've waited long enough.

56:38.396 --> 56:40.662
- I'm sorry there's no
room for you at the house,

56:40.664 --> 56:42.131
but I'll give the church
a call tomorrow and see

56:42.133 --> 56:45.067
if we can fit you
in somewhere, okay?

56:45.069 --> 56:46.602
- Well, don't go
out of your way.

56:46.604 --> 56:48.537
- Lose the attitude.

56:53.610 --> 56:55.544
You gonna apologize?

56:56.813 --> 56:57.880
- I'm sorry.

56:59.149 --> 57:01.984
- I'm just really proud of you,

57:01.986 --> 57:03.752
for humblin'
yourself, comin' back

57:03.754 --> 57:06.188
and apologizin' to everybody.

57:07.590 --> 57:09.758
- Yeah, I wanted to
talk to you about that.

57:09.760 --> 57:13.128
I don't think I'm
gonna do that anymore.

57:13.130 --> 57:15.798
- You still don't know
what's good for you, do you?

57:15.800 --> 57:18.066
- Good for
me or good for you?

57:18.068 --> 57:22.070
- Oh, givin' away grace,
that was good for you?

57:28.678 --> 57:32.748
- It's been a long time
since we talked, so, um,

57:34.117 --> 57:37.486
I think I'll, I think I'll
show you a little grace.

57:37.488 --> 57:40.489
But let me remind you
what I told you last time,

57:40.491 --> 57:43.525
back when I still lived here.

57:43.527 --> 57:44.993
I don't ever want you to
talk about my daughter

57:44.995 --> 57:46.528
in front of me.

57:47.464 --> 57:50.199
If you weren't my dad, I swear,

57:50.201 --> 57:52.568
I swear I'd beat the
living hell out of you.

57:52.570 --> 57:53.836
And I don't mean that as a joke.

57:53.838 --> 57:56.972
I mean I would, i
would destroy you.

57:59.176 --> 58:00.943
- Do you, you think
you're mad, what about me?

58:02.980 --> 58:05.914
People in our family don't
give away their kids.

58:05.916 --> 58:07.483
So, why did you?

58:07.485 --> 58:08.917
- You wanna
know why I did it?

58:08.919 --> 58:10.152
- Yes, I wanna know!

58:10.154 --> 58:10.152
- All right, I'll
tell you.

58:10.154 --> 58:15.157
I'll tell you something, dad,
that I never told anybody.

58:15.159 --> 58:17.826
You wanna hear the real truth
about why I gave away grace?

58:17.828 --> 58:20.796
It's this: Because one day i
was afraid I was gonna grow up

58:20.798 --> 58:23.198
and I was gonna be like you,

58:24.501 --> 58:26.602
and that I'd have her,

58:27.570 --> 58:29.605
I'd have my kid, I'd
have my little Gracie,

58:29.607 --> 58:31.507
and one day I'd be you

58:32.675 --> 58:35.611
and I didn't want her to grow
up and have a dad like you,

58:35.613 --> 58:37.679
a dad like that I had,
because she deserv--

58:41.151 --> 58:43.785
- you will not disrespect
me in my house!

58:43.787 --> 58:45.888
Yeah, I remember the day you
gave away my granddaughter.

58:45.890 --> 58:47.789
You told me you didn't
want her to grow up

58:47.791 --> 58:49.591
in a broken home like you did!

58:49.593 --> 58:51.927
Well, as noble as
that may sound,

58:51.929 --> 58:54.930
there's just one
problem for that.

58:54.932 --> 58:56.899
You'll never be with anybody.

58:56.901 --> 58:58.800
You wanna know why?

58:58.802 --> 59:01.537
Because you want
a woman of quality

59:01.539 --> 59:02.938
and the problem with that is

59:02.940 --> 59:05.140
a woman of quality
will never want you.

59:05.142 --> 59:06.308
And why would they?

59:06.310 --> 59:10.078
You won't even go after
your own daughter.

59:10.080 --> 59:13.148
You just leave her
there, abandoned.

59:14.284 --> 59:17.653
You don't want her,
you're just a loser.

59:18.555 --> 59:21.723
That's all you are,
a fucking coward.

59:25.563 --> 59:27.696
Get outta my house.

59:30.601 --> 59:32.834
- Hello, ragamuffin.

59:35.772 --> 59:37.639
- How'd you find me?

59:37.641 --> 59:40.342
- I just looked for the, uh,
closest bar to your house.

59:40.344 --> 59:43.111
- I need another shot.

59:43.113 --> 59:43.111
- Hey, take it easy.

59:43.113 --> 59:47.316
- Kid, they used to call me
the funnel before I was 20.

59:47.318 --> 59:49.284
You don't have to
worry about me.

59:49.286 --> 59:51.053
I'll have another drink.

59:51.055 --> 59:52.888
Hey, give me one.

59:52.890 --> 59:55.057
- How are you and roslyn?

59:57.627 --> 59:58.293
- Roslyn.

01:00:01.698 --> 01:00:02.764
I met her in

01:00:04.667 --> 01:00:06.668
Morgan city, Louisiana.

01:00:12.175 --> 01:00:15.177
I was on a speaking
engagement and,

01:00:17.747 --> 01:00:20.749
this bombshell
brunette walks in.

01:00:24.287 --> 01:00:27.322
She comes up to me and she says,
"i don't know why I'm here.

01:00:27.324 --> 01:00:29.224
"There's nothing wrong with me."

01:00:29.226 --> 01:00:30.659
But there was.

01:00:31.327 --> 01:00:33.729
With her, just like with me.

01:00:36.366 --> 01:00:37.899
- That's how you met?

01:00:37.901 --> 01:00:39.067
- Yeah.

01:00:42.039 --> 01:00:42.938
We liked

01:00:45.642 --> 01:00:46.341
walks,

01:00:49.045 --> 01:00:51.747
ice cream, her two daughters.

01:00:54.117 --> 01:00:55.951
I love my roz.

01:00:55.953 --> 01:00:59.655
(Muffled blues music

01:00:59.657 --> 01:01:00.922
give me another drink!

01:01:00.924 --> 01:01:02.691
- No, no,
no, you had enough.

01:01:02.693 --> 01:01:03.725
You're done, Brennan.

01:01:03.727 --> 01:01:04.693
- Hey, no more for him.

01:01:04.695 --> 01:01:05.427
- No, no, he's, he's cut off.

01:01:05.429 --> 01:01:07.729
- I want another drink!

01:01:07.731 --> 01:01:10.065
- All right, Brennan, you
know, you're done, all right?

01:01:10.067 --> 01:01:12.067
- I want another drink!

01:01:13.002 --> 01:01:14.269
Give me another drink!

01:01:14.271 --> 01:01:15.671
- You need to keep
your voice down.

01:01:15.673 --> 01:01:18.240
- I want another drink!

01:01:18.242 --> 01:01:18.240
- I want another drink!
- - Calm down.

01:01:18.242 --> 01:01:20.842
- No, you didn't finish that.
- - Calm down.

01:01:20.844 --> 01:01:21.777
- Give
me another drink!

01:01:21.779 --> 01:01:23.045
- Hey, Brennan, calm down.

01:01:23.047 --> 01:01:24.713
- I told you, that was--
- I want another drink--

01:01:24.715 --> 01:01:25.681
- the last one that you got.
- Give me another drink!

01:01:25.683 --> 01:01:25.681
- Hey!
- I want another drink!

01:01:25.683 --> 01:01:28.116
- Get outta here--
- come on, let's go.

01:01:28.118 --> 01:01:29.418
- Or I'm gonna have
to call the cops, git!

01:01:29.420 --> 01:01:30.786
- I just wanted a, a--
- you don't have

01:01:30.788 --> 01:01:32.020
to call the cops.
- I just wanted a, no--

01:01:32.022 --> 01:01:33.422
- come on, we're
getting out of here.

01:01:33.424 --> 01:01:34.089
- I wanted anoth--
come on, Brennan, come on.

01:01:35.459 --> 01:01:37.726
It's okay, Brennan.

01:01:37.728 --> 01:01:39.761
- Yeah, i
could walk on my own.

01:01:39.763 --> 01:01:41.763
- I got you.
- No, don't drop me.

01:01:41.765 --> 01:01:41.763
- I'm not gonna drop you.

01:01:41.765 --> 01:01:43.432
- No, don't drop me.
- I'm not gon--

01:01:46.770 --> 01:01:49.805
well, you're drunk anyway,
you won't remember.

01:02:34.785 --> 01:02:37.152
You had one hell of
a life, haven't ya?

01:02:45.129 --> 01:02:47.095
God, I know that

01:02:47.097 --> 01:02:51.500
you and I haven't exactly
been on speaking terms.

01:02:51.502 --> 01:02:54.503
I'm sorry about
that, I just, uh,

01:02:55.838 --> 01:02:59.374
I think if I'm honest
with you I just, uh,

01:02:59.376 --> 01:03:02.277
I've been really
angry at you, um,

01:03:04.781 --> 01:03:07.783
I think I've just
been mad that, um,

01:03:09.085 --> 01:03:12.087
mad that I'm
convinced you're real.

01:03:13.322 --> 01:03:14.222
Um,

01:03:15.491 --> 01:03:16.558
because, uh,

01:03:21.532 --> 01:03:24.366
'cause I just
don't like how, uh,

01:03:26.102 --> 01:03:29.070
you know, I've been
treated by, um,

01:03:30.473 --> 01:03:34.109
some of these folks that call
themselves christians and, uh,

01:03:36.112 --> 01:03:39.881
it's just not a club
i wanna be a part of.

01:03:40.983 --> 01:03:44.986
At least that's how i
feel most days and, uh,

01:03:46.088 --> 01:03:48.924
and I guess I just have
taken it out on you, I guess.

01:03:48.926 --> 01:03:52.160
I don't know, I'm
just, I'm just worried

01:03:52.162 --> 01:03:54.963
about my friend
Brennan, and, uh,

01:03:56.265 --> 01:03:59.501
I'm really worried
about him, and, um,

01:04:01.604 --> 01:04:03.438
if I'm being honest,

01:04:05.442 --> 01:04:07.843
I'm worried about me, too.

01:04:10.847 --> 01:04:12.614
I'm worried about me, too.

01:04:19.622 --> 01:04:20.889
Better?

01:04:20.891 --> 01:04:21.990
- Thanks.

01:04:21.992 --> 01:04:26.995
- Hey, I, uh also got you
this, too, just in case.

01:04:29.365 --> 01:04:31.099
- Give me your hand.

01:04:32.401 --> 01:04:36.605
You are filled with the
compassion of our father, Jim.

01:04:37.440 --> 01:04:39.040
I see it in you.

01:04:49.386 --> 01:04:51.586
- I guess that's better than
what you're filled with.

01:04:51.588 --> 01:04:52.487
- Oh.

01:04:53.489 --> 01:04:54.923
Roslyn's gone.

01:04:55.625 --> 01:04:57.092
- All right, then,
so what's your plan?

01:04:57.094 --> 01:04:58.560
- Plan?

01:04:58.562 --> 01:05:00.195
- Yeah, you're always
talkin' about a plan

01:05:00.197 --> 01:05:01.897
how you're gonna
save your marriage.

01:05:01.899 --> 01:05:03.598
- Yeah, then she left.

01:05:04.500 --> 01:05:04.499
- So?

01:05:04.501 --> 01:05:08.069
She's your wife, get her back,
don't stop fighting for her.

01:05:08.071 --> 01:05:09.337
- I've ruined everything.

01:05:09.339 --> 01:05:10.906
- No, you haven't.

01:05:12.275 --> 01:05:14.209
You're talkin' to a guy
that's ruined everything.

01:05:14.211 --> 01:05:16.978
I'll let you know when you do.

01:05:17.980 --> 01:05:19.514
So, what's your plan?

01:05:19.516 --> 01:05:21.583
Come on, Brennan,
what's your plan?

01:05:21.585 --> 01:05:23.218
- You wanna know
what my plan is?

01:05:23.220 --> 01:05:25.954
I'm gonna start drinking,
and I'm gonna keep drinking,

01:05:25.956 --> 01:05:28.156
and I'm gonna drink until
i can't remember anything.

01:05:28.158 --> 01:05:29.958
And I'm gonna drink
until I forget

01:05:29.960 --> 01:05:31.359
that I've lost one
of the greatest gifts

01:05:31.361 --> 01:05:33.695
that god has ever given me.

01:05:35.164 --> 01:05:36.631
Plan.

01:05:36.633 --> 01:05:37.699
- No, drinking doesn't
make you forget the past.

01:05:37.701 --> 01:05:39.367
You know what it does?

01:05:39.369 --> 01:05:41.670
It makes you wanna take
off your shirt, run around,

01:05:41.672 --> 01:05:45.006
chant some African tribe mantra,

01:05:45.008 --> 01:05:47.676
and try to make out with
a monkey at the zoo.

01:05:50.480 --> 01:05:52.280
I should know.

01:05:52.282 --> 01:05:54.049
I went to college.

01:05:54.951 --> 01:05:56.384
- You know, you're
my only friend, Jim.

01:05:56.386 --> 01:05:57.585
- Hey, sleep it off, Brennan.

01:05:57.587 --> 01:06:00.188
You'll feel better
in the morning, okay?

01:06:00.190 --> 01:06:02.524
- I'm a drunk, Jim.

01:06:02.526 --> 01:06:06.194
- Brennan, one night
doesn't make you a drunk.

01:06:06.196 --> 01:06:08.063
- If you only knew.

01:06:10.099 --> 01:06:11.967
I'm a hypocrite.

01:06:11.969 --> 01:06:14.235
- Hey, hey, no you're not.

01:06:14.237 --> 01:06:16.071
- Yes, I am.

01:06:16.073 --> 01:06:18.740
- Brennan, I want you
to listen to me, okay?

01:06:18.742 --> 01:06:21.743
You're not a drunk,
you're not a hypocrite,

01:06:21.745 --> 01:06:25.413
you're not a protestant,
you're not a catholic.

01:06:25.415 --> 01:06:28.583
You're not a franciscan
priest, you're not an author.

01:06:28.585 --> 01:06:29.517
You're not even Brennan Manning,

01:06:29.519 --> 01:06:31.987
the vagabond evangelist, okay?

01:06:33.222 --> 01:06:35.557
You wanna know who you are?

01:06:36.492 --> 01:06:37.459
- Who am I?

01:06:38.561 --> 01:06:41.396
- You're the one
that Jesus loves.

01:06:45.768 --> 01:06:47.535
- Good night, Jim.

01:06:53.476 --> 01:06:54.609
- Good night.

01:07:01.183 --> 01:07:04.753
I'll let you clean
that up in the morning.

01:07:10.127 --> 01:07:13.361
Hey, I got it, what do you say
we get our mind off things,

01:07:13.363 --> 01:07:15.530
go out, have some fun,
maybe we could hit up

01:07:15.532 --> 01:07:18.099
the French quarter,
café du monde.

01:07:18.101 --> 01:07:19.534
- You know, just because
I'm divorced doesn't mean

01:07:19.536 --> 01:07:19.534
I need a babysitter.

01:07:19.536 --> 01:07:23.505
- Don't look at it like that,
you'd be helping me out.

01:07:23.507 --> 01:07:26.207
Seriously, I genuinely
need some help.

01:07:26.209 --> 01:07:28.543
I won't be a burden, if i
could just crash on your couch

01:07:28.545 --> 01:07:30.779
for a few days, I'd
really appreciate it.

01:07:30.781 --> 01:07:33.715
- What are you gonna do when
you get back to San Diego?

01:07:33.717 --> 01:07:36.051
I mean, what kind
of work do you do?

01:07:36.053 --> 01:07:38.520
- Yeah, I'm still tryin'
to figure that out.

01:07:38.522 --> 01:07:40.588
Um, ironically, i
used to actually

01:07:40.590 --> 01:07:42.490
wanna be a preacher like you.

01:07:42.492 --> 01:07:44.692
Uh, but what I found is
that it's pretty tough

01:07:44.694 --> 01:07:48.396
to find a pastor job when
you're a foul-mouthed,

01:07:48.398 --> 01:07:52.100
chain-smoking guy who
had a baby outta wedlock.

01:07:52.102 --> 01:07:54.302
- Yeah, that's tough.

01:07:54.304 --> 01:07:56.704
- So, do you really feel like
you don't have any friends?

01:07:56.706 --> 01:07:58.440
- I never said that.

01:07:58.442 --> 01:08:00.809
- You said it, last night.

01:08:00.811 --> 01:08:03.244
- Figures, no, I got
plenty of friends.

01:08:03.246 --> 01:08:05.513
I got, I have friends in
all parts of the world.

01:08:05.515 --> 01:08:08.083
Why, why, Paul, Paul
is my best friend.

01:08:08.085 --> 01:08:11.419
But then there's
fil and Jim, butch,

01:08:11.421 --> 01:08:14.823
Suzy, ed, James,
got lots of frie--

01:08:14.825 --> 01:08:17.859
oh, ray, did I ever
tell you about ray?

01:08:17.861 --> 01:08:18.693
- Mm mm.

01:08:18.694 --> 01:08:20.095
- Ray Brennan?

01:08:20.096 --> 01:08:21.830
- Oh, you guys
have the same name?

01:08:21.832 --> 01:08:24.232
- Well, my name
wasn't always Brennan.

01:08:24.234 --> 01:08:25.667
- I totally wanna
hear this story,

01:08:25.669 --> 01:08:26.801
but would you mind
if I went outside

01:08:26.803 --> 01:08:26.801
and grabbed a quick smoke?

01:08:26.803 --> 01:08:30.772
- You know, you should really
consider quitting smoking.

01:08:30.774 --> 01:08:34.109
- You know, you should really
consider quitting being old.

01:08:34.111 --> 01:08:36.743
- No, no, no, I'm serious,
this thing is gonna kill you.

01:08:36.746 --> 01:08:38.513
- No, I'm serious,
being old will kill you.

01:08:38.515 --> 01:08:39.581
- Oh, Jesus.

01:09:08.444 --> 01:09:11.779
I remember one fateful
day in the foxhole.

01:09:11.781 --> 01:09:14.782
We were sharing a
bar of chocolate,

01:09:16.417 --> 01:09:20.287
a live grenade came
flying into the trench.

01:09:21.490 --> 01:09:25.560
Ray looked at me, smiled,
then threw himself on it.

01:09:26.828 --> 01:09:28.263
Saved my life.

01:09:29.899 --> 01:09:30.932
- Wow.

01:09:30.934 --> 01:09:32.200
- Yeah, wow.

01:09:34.203 --> 01:09:36.738
I was born Richard Manning.

01:09:36.740 --> 01:09:40.707
But when I decided
to become a priest,

01:09:40.710 --> 01:09:43.211
I took Ray's name.

01:09:43.212 --> 01:09:45.680
- That's beautiful and intense.

01:09:48.584 --> 01:09:50.852
So, do you guys always
dress like this?

01:10:10.740 --> 01:10:12.207
Well, the only thing i
ever did for anybody,

01:10:12.209 --> 01:10:13.675
was I made dinner for
my buddy's girlfriend,

01:10:13.677 --> 01:10:16.578
but I let my buddy
pretend like he made it.

01:10:16.580 --> 01:10:20.949
- Well, what about driving 27
hours taking me to Louisiana?

01:10:20.951 --> 01:10:22.584
- Hey, I'll be right back.

01:10:43.772 --> 01:10:44.772
April?

01:10:49.613 --> 01:10:50.912
- Hey, mom?

01:10:59.822 --> 01:11:01.389
- What's goin' on?

01:11:03.826 --> 01:11:04.659
- Nothin'.

01:11:15.638 --> 01:11:20.541
Dear grace, I wish I could
change the past, but I can't and

01:11:20.543 --> 01:11:22.043
even though we were
making a choice

01:11:22.045 --> 01:11:24.412
or trying to make a choice
that was better for you,

01:11:24.414 --> 01:11:28.016
versus better for us, it's
still an impossible reality

01:11:28.018 --> 01:11:32.287
to live with because it's
a reality without you.

01:11:35.658 --> 01:11:38.559
- You're writing
to your daughter?

01:11:41.397 --> 01:11:42.530
Don't you think
she'd rather hear

01:11:42.532 --> 01:11:45.833
what you have to say in person?

01:11:45.835 --> 01:11:47.502
- I don't wanna talk about
it with you, Brennan.

01:11:47.504 --> 01:11:48.736
Isn't it obvious?

01:11:48.738 --> 01:11:50.772
- Well, you don't
have to, forget it.

01:11:59.381 --> 01:12:01.816
- Okay, got a question for you.

01:12:03.419 --> 01:12:05.386
Why are you a preacher?

01:12:08.757 --> 01:12:12.360
- Do you remember the
talk I gave awhile back?

01:12:12.362 --> 01:12:15.463
About the movie,
chariots of fire?

01:12:17.032 --> 01:12:20.435
"When I run fast i
feel god's pleasure."

01:12:23.405 --> 01:12:27.709
Well, when I preach, when
i talk, and when I rant,

01:12:27.711 --> 01:12:30.478
and when I rave
about god's love,

01:12:30.480 --> 01:12:32.380
I feel god's pleasure.

01:12:33.682 --> 01:12:36.084
What else do you wanna know?

01:12:37.653 --> 01:12:41.889
- If you could be Batman of
superman, who would you choose?

01:12:44.093 --> 01:12:46.394
- No question, Batman!

01:12:48.364 --> 01:12:51.099
- Brennan, I think you
and I were destined

01:12:51.101 --> 01:12:52.834
to become friends.

01:12:52.836 --> 01:12:54.535
- You're a nut.

01:12:54.537 --> 01:12:57.572
- Oh, you wanna go walk
around the quarter?

01:12:57.574 --> 01:13:00.375
Lemme finish this first.

01:13:09.386 --> 01:13:13.621
No way, you spent six months
in a jail, a Swiss jail?

01:13:14.957 --> 01:13:18.993
- Yes, only the warden knew
i wasn't a real inmate.

01:13:18.995 --> 01:13:18.993
- You're lucky he didn't die.

01:13:18.995 --> 01:13:21.863
You would've had a Shawshank
redemption situation

01:13:21.865 --> 01:13:23.765
on your hands.

01:13:23.767 --> 01:13:24.999
- What's that?

01:13:26.935 --> 01:13:28.669
- You really don't
watch movies, do you?

01:13:35.612 --> 01:13:37.445
Why, what's your favorite book?

01:13:37.447 --> 01:13:40.848
- On being a Christian,
hans kung, favorite movie?

01:13:40.850 --> 01:13:42.750
- I'd say it's a tie
between dead poet society

01:13:42.752 --> 01:13:44.952
and good will hunting,
although I will say

01:13:44.954 --> 01:13:47.622
that I liked die hard
so much as a kid,

01:13:47.624 --> 01:13:49.457
I used to dress up in a tank top

01:13:49.459 --> 01:13:53.060
and run around my, uh,
front driveway barefoot,

01:13:53.062 --> 01:13:54.429
pretending I was
fighting terrorists.

01:13:55.765 --> 01:13:58.433
I still do that now
but people stare more.

01:14:25.994 --> 01:14:28.029
- Excuse me,
are you Brennan Manning?

01:14:28.031 --> 01:14:29.130
- I've been told I am.

01:14:29.132 --> 01:14:31.566
- Damn it, I owe him 20 dollars,

01:14:31.568 --> 01:14:32.533
I thought you were
Anthony Hopkins.

01:14:32.535 --> 01:14:33.968
- Oh, I'm--

01:14:33.970 --> 01:14:35.770
- Brennan, these are my
friends, this is, uh, Randy--

01:14:35.772 --> 01:14:36.871
- hi, Randy.
- Good to meet you.

01:14:36.873 --> 01:14:36.871
- P.C. And Justin.
- Hi.

01:14:36.873 --> 01:14:39.941
- How you doin', brother?
- Two of our good buddies

01:14:39.943 --> 01:14:41.476
wanted to be here tonight
but they couldn't make it,

01:14:41.478 --> 01:14:42.844
Sean chadwell and Kyle Jennings,

01:14:42.846 --> 01:14:45.179
but I wanted them to meet
you and you to meet them.

01:14:45.181 --> 01:14:47.748
- Well, I have an idea,
let's all get a drink.

01:14:47.750 --> 01:14:48.883
- Yup!

01:14:49.819 --> 01:14:51.919
- My kinda guy.

01:14:51.921 --> 01:14:54.589
- I can hang out with
these guys any time.

01:14:54.591 --> 01:14:54.589
We've had a fun day--
- well, look--

01:14:54.591 --> 01:14:56.657
- we've had a long day--
- here are my keys--

01:14:56.659 --> 01:14:57.892
let's just go home.

01:14:57.894 --> 01:14:59.560
- No, no, here are
my keys, just a sec.

01:14:59.562 --> 01:14:59.560
- No, no, look, if you're
goin' in I'm coming with you.

01:14:59.562 --> 01:15:04.699
- Look, I told you once before
i don't need a babysitter.

01:15:04.701 --> 01:15:06.100
- We're friends now, right?

01:15:06.102 --> 01:15:07.034
- Uh huh.

01:15:07.036 --> 01:15:08.169
- I can be honest with you?

01:15:08.171 --> 01:15:09.036
- Be honest.
- Be real with you?

01:15:09.038 --> 01:15:10.605
- Okay.
- Okay,

01:15:10.607 --> 01:15:13.508
you're drinking
yourself to death.

01:15:14.576 --> 01:15:17.245
Okay, listen, you're
drinking yourself to death,

01:15:17.247 --> 01:15:21.749
and just, and doin' that is
not gonna bring roslyn back.

01:15:21.751 --> 01:15:24.519
- Okay, you don't wanna talk
about your daughter, right?

01:15:24.521 --> 01:15:28.155
Right, well, I don't wanna
talk about my drinking,

01:15:28.157 --> 01:15:29.524
so just leave it at that.

01:15:29.526 --> 01:15:29.524
You wanna go home?

01:15:29.526 --> 01:15:33.127
Go home, I'm going
in for a drink!

01:15:40.068 --> 01:15:40.968
- Brennan?

01:15:54.284 --> 01:15:55.116
Brennan?

01:16:03.593 --> 01:16:05.059
Oh my god, Brennan.

01:16:06.595 --> 01:16:09.864
She's gone, she's
gone, my roz is gone

01:16:09.866 --> 01:16:11.599
and she's not coming back!

01:16:11.601 --> 01:16:15.670
Roz is gone.

01:16:15.672 --> 01:16:18.973
And it's my fault,
it's all,

01:16:18.975 --> 01:16:22.043
I wanted to tell her i
love her and now I can't.

01:16:22.045 --> 01:16:24.712
I can't, I'm a stupid
drunk and I'm a liar,

01:16:24.714 --> 01:16:26.681
I'm a hypocrite, I'm an imposter

01:16:26.683 --> 01:16:28.683
and I don't wanna
be a pastor anymore.

01:16:28.685 --> 01:16:31.152
I don't wanna be a preacher,
i don't wanna be anything!

01:16:31.154 --> 01:16:33.921
I don't think i
wanna live anymore.

01:16:33.923 --> 01:16:35.723
Roz is gone, you understand?

01:16:35.725 --> 01:16:37.325
- Roz is gone!
- - I know.

01:16:37.327 --> 01:16:39.694
- I don't wanna be a
priest or, I don't wanna

01:16:39.696 --> 01:16:41.128
be anything anymore,
- you're just

01:16:41.130 --> 01:16:42.997
- havin' a hard time.
- - I, no, no, no,

01:16:42.999 --> 01:16:44.632
- you're just havin'

01:16:44.634 --> 01:16:45.099
- a hard time, Brennan.
- - No, no, no, no!

01:16:45.101 --> 01:16:46.033
- Yes!

01:16:46.035 --> 01:16:47.201
- I can't accept,

01:16:47.203 --> 01:16:48.135
I don't know what's
wrong with me.

01:16:48.137 --> 01:16:49.737
Why do I lie, why do I drink?

01:16:49.739 --> 01:16:51.339
I don't know what the
hell is wrong with me!

01:16:51.341 --> 01:16:51.339
- Lies, what are you

01:16:51.341 --> 01:16:53.608
talkin' about?
- I'm just outta my mind!

01:16:53.610 --> 01:16:54.875
She's gone, you understand that?

01:16:54.877 --> 01:16:58.145
And she's not coming
back, my roz is gone!

01:18:30.739 --> 01:18:33.741
- What is this Thomas
Jefferson's phone?

01:18:46.788 --> 01:18:46.787
- What are
you still doing here?

01:18:46.789 --> 01:18:49.423
- I live here, what
are you doing here?

01:18:49.425 --> 01:18:51.092
- The whole neighborhood's
being evacuated.

01:18:51.094 --> 01:18:53.227
Get what you need
and get out of here!

01:18:53.229 --> 01:18:53.227
- Are, are you serious?

01:18:53.229 --> 01:18:57.231
- Yes, I'm serious,
don't you watch the news?

01:18:57.233 --> 01:18:59.400
Jessie, you and Brian
check that house.

01:18:59.402 --> 01:19:01.068
Get everyone outta here!

01:19:04.073 --> 01:19:05.940
- Jim, get up,
it's an emergency!

01:19:05.942 --> 01:19:07.274
We gotta get out of here!

01:19:07.276 --> 01:19:08.409
Come on, Jim!

01:19:10.979 --> 01:19:13.114
- They are
calling it hurricane Katrina

01:19:13.116 --> 01:19:14.448
and experts are saying it is

01:19:14.450 --> 01:19:16.917
quite possibly the third
strongest hurricane

01:19:16.919 --> 01:19:20.454
America has seen in
the last hundred years.

01:19:20.456 --> 01:19:21.922
This hurricane is
hitting the Gulf shore

01:19:21.924 --> 01:19:24.191
with the power of a
nuclear explosion.

01:19:24.193 --> 01:19:27.394
Estimated winds are set
at 125 miles per hour

01:19:27.396 --> 01:19:30.097
with expectations to
increase overnight.

01:19:30.099 --> 01:19:34.268
- Yeah, yeah, it's
right across the street.

01:19:34.270 --> 01:19:35.169
No.

01:19:36.004 --> 01:19:37.805
Okay, see you in a second.

01:19:37.807 --> 01:19:38.038
- Who is that?

01:19:42.444 --> 01:19:44.845
- Hey, take it easy with that.

01:19:44.847 --> 01:19:46.380
- You know what?

01:19:46.382 --> 01:19:47.882
- But
it's simply too dangerous

01:19:47.884 --> 01:19:49.550
right now--
- I had it with your,

01:19:49.552 --> 01:19:52.553
"enough's enough
and take it easy."

01:19:52.555 --> 01:19:55.956
You sound like a, a,
a, a broken record.

01:19:59.996 --> 01:20:00.961
Who's that?

01:20:02.330 --> 01:20:03.564
- I'll get it.

01:20:07.904 --> 01:20:08.536
- Jim?

01:20:08.538 --> 01:20:10.004
- Yeah.
- Paul.

01:20:10.006 --> 01:20:10.805
- Hey, man,
thanks for comin'.

01:20:12.809 --> 01:20:15.476
- How are you, Brennan?

01:20:15.478 --> 01:20:19.280
- I, I, I'm not good,
I'm not good, I, it's--

01:20:20.415 --> 01:20:23.350
- well, I brought
the guys together.

01:20:23.352 --> 01:20:25.152
- You brought
the guys together?

01:20:25.154 --> 01:20:26.420
- Yeah, they all wanna see you.

01:20:26.422 --> 01:20:28.589
We're doing another
one of our retreats.

01:20:28.591 --> 01:20:29.890
- Hm?

01:20:30.559 --> 01:20:31.926
Was that this weekend?

01:20:31.928 --> 01:20:33.994
- Yeah, uh--
- oh.

01:20:33.996 --> 01:20:36.931
- You and your friend
Jim wanna come?

01:20:36.933 --> 01:20:38.299
- Jim?

01:20:38.301 --> 01:20:42.102
- I'm right here,
yeah, I'd love to go.

01:20:43.071 --> 01:20:44.205
- Yeah, okay.

01:20:45.040 --> 01:20:46.907
- Great, let's go.

01:20:46.909 --> 01:20:47.608
Yeah.

01:20:48.977 --> 01:20:49.877
Okay.

01:20:54.617 --> 01:20:55.583
- The search
and rescue teams brought

01:20:55.585 --> 01:20:57.384
more people--
- oh, boy.

01:20:58.887 --> 01:20:58.886
You know what?

01:20:58.888 --> 01:21:01.121
He kinda looks like
a surprised fish

01:21:01.123 --> 01:21:04.091
when he's drunk passed
out, doesn't he?

01:21:04.093 --> 01:21:05.292
- Um, you got

01:21:05.294 --> 01:21:06.327
that answer, and
we'll talk about it.

01:21:06.329 --> 01:21:08.028
- Okay.

01:21:09.631 --> 01:21:13.934
- Uh, Brennan, you know,
this is not a retreat.

01:21:13.936 --> 01:21:18.372
I, I, I think you know what's
going on here, don't you?

01:21:18.374 --> 01:21:20.908
Brennan, this is
an intervention.

01:21:20.910 --> 01:21:22.943
- Did you instigate this, Jim?

01:21:22.945 --> 01:21:24.144
- Calm down, Brennan.

01:21:24.146 --> 01:21:25.646
- Don't treat me
like a child, Paul.

01:21:25.648 --> 01:21:29.516
All right, get on with it,
say what you're gonna say.

01:21:29.518 --> 01:21:32.386
- You're drinking is
outta control, Brennan.

01:21:32.388 --> 01:21:33.587
- Brennan, I don't understand

01:21:33.589 --> 01:21:35.456
why you don't return
any of my calls.

01:21:35.458 --> 01:21:35.456
- Man, we've been
friends for a long time

01:21:35.458 --> 01:21:40.661
but it feels like all you
care about is just you.

01:21:40.663 --> 01:21:43.597
- Brennan, I just can't
believe how selfish you seem.

01:21:43.599 --> 01:21:44.999
You're, you're,
you're a hypocrite

01:21:45.001 --> 01:21:46.667
and you just don't seem to care.

01:21:46.669 --> 01:21:47.968
- Let's cut straight
to the chase.

01:21:47.970 --> 01:21:50.004
You manipulate everyone.

01:21:50.006 --> 01:21:51.438
- And you're addicted to lying.

01:21:51.440 --> 01:21:53.240
- Brennan, the truth is
you've hurt all of us,

01:21:53.242 --> 01:21:55.342
but you've been there
for all of us, too.

01:21:55.344 --> 01:21:57.945
- Brennan, I have learned
more about compassion

01:21:57.947 --> 01:22:02.016
and kindness from you than
anyone I've ever been around.

01:22:02.018 --> 01:22:04.084
- You're one of my
closest friends.

01:22:04.086 --> 01:22:06.020
- I don't know where my
wife and I would be today,

01:22:06.022 --> 01:22:08.923
Brennan, without you, you,
you saved our marriage.

01:22:08.925 --> 01:22:10.591
- And you're loved.

01:22:10.593 --> 01:22:14.361
- I agree with Paul, you,
you have hurt all of us

01:22:14.363 --> 01:22:15.596
and your wife.

01:22:17.332 --> 01:22:19.533
- And you need help.

01:22:19.535 --> 01:22:21.268
- You know my story.

01:22:22.304 --> 01:22:25.673
And you're the one
that got me to love me.

01:22:27.976 --> 01:22:30.945
Why can't you do
that for yourself?

01:22:30.947 --> 01:22:34.982
Why can't you love you the
way you love everybody else?

01:22:37.152 --> 01:22:38.519
- Finished, that's it?

01:22:38.521 --> 01:22:40.187
You got anything to say?

01:22:40.189 --> 01:22:41.956
Okay, I'm done.

01:22:49.431 --> 01:22:51.198
- Let me go get your
the trashcan so you--

01:22:51.200 --> 01:22:52.266
- you
know, you're stupid.

01:22:52.268 --> 01:22:53.667
- Don't throw up

01:22:53.669 --> 01:22:54.601
- all over all my stuff.
- - You're just plain

01:22:54.603 --> 01:22:56.236
stupid, yeah, you're stupid,

01:22:56.238 --> 01:23:00.474
you're plain stupid!

01:23:01.609 --> 01:23:03.143
- I was just trying
to be your friend.

01:23:03.145 --> 01:23:04.111
- Friend?

01:23:04.113 --> 01:23:05.112
You're no friend of mine!

01:23:05.114 --> 01:23:07.047
You're no friend of mine!

01:23:07.049 --> 01:23:09.683
Ray was a friend of mine, ray!

01:23:09.685 --> 01:23:12.286
He was truly my best
friend in Chicago

01:23:12.288 --> 01:23:15.656
and then he had to go die in
a house fire, my friend, ray.

01:23:17.727 --> 01:23:19.593
- What'd you just say?

01:23:19.595 --> 01:23:21.028
- I said ray was my best friend.

01:23:21.030 --> 01:23:22.730
- Before that, what did you say?

01:23:22.732 --> 01:23:25.532
- I said he died
in a house fire.

01:23:25.534 --> 01:23:27.601
- That's what I thought
you said, you lied to me.

01:23:27.603 --> 01:23:29.703
- I never lied to you.

01:23:29.705 --> 01:23:31.138
- You told me,

01:23:32.073 --> 01:23:33.774
you told me that your
friend died in Korea.

01:23:33.776 --> 01:23:34.742
- I never said that!

01:23:34.744 --> 01:23:36.010
- I'm not done!

01:23:37.179 --> 01:23:39.246
You told me your
friend died in Korea,

01:23:39.248 --> 01:23:41.715
jumping on a grenade,
saving your life.

01:23:41.717 --> 01:23:43.517
That's the story!
- I never said that!

01:23:43.519 --> 01:23:44.685
- You never said that?

01:23:44.687 --> 01:23:44.685
- No, I didn't.

01:23:44.687 --> 01:23:47.388
- Did you lie to me
about anything else?

01:23:47.390 --> 01:23:49.089
- I ain't never lied to
you about anything else.

01:23:49.091 --> 01:23:49.089
- So you did lie!

01:23:49.091 --> 01:23:51.058
- No, I didn't lie!

01:23:51.060 --> 01:23:52.493
- I'm sick of guys like you--

01:23:52.495 --> 01:23:53.761
- listen, I'm sick of you--
- coming into my life

01:23:53.763 --> 01:23:56.130
tryin' to be--
- I am sick and tired of you!

01:23:56.132 --> 01:23:59.133
Let me tell you something,
you got a kid there

01:23:59.135 --> 01:24:01.802
that you don't go and visit,
you have nothing but sick,

01:24:01.804 --> 01:24:06.140
pathetic excuses for a
sick, pathetic little boy.

01:24:06.142 --> 01:24:08.108
You gotta start caring about you

01:24:08.110 --> 01:24:08.108
when you get it in here.

01:24:08.110 --> 01:24:08.108
- Do you want me to throw you
- that you care about you--

01:24:08.110 --> 01:24:11.512
- across the room?
- Because you don't know

01:24:11.514 --> 01:24:13.714
what the hell life is all about.

01:24:13.716 --> 01:24:15.082
- You listen to me,

01:24:15.084 --> 01:24:15.082
listen to me--
- I'm sick and tired

01:24:15.084 --> 01:24:17.051
of listening to you.
- Listen to me.

01:24:17.053 --> 01:24:17.818
Listen to me.
- Just get out!

01:24:17.820 --> 01:24:20.621
I've had it with you, get out!

01:24:20.623 --> 01:24:22.122
- Don't you--

01:24:22.124 --> 01:24:22.122
- we're done, out!

01:24:22.124 --> 01:24:24.358
- Listen to me.

01:24:24.360 --> 01:24:25.592
- Get out!

01:24:25.594 --> 01:24:26.827
- Not until you--

01:24:26.829 --> 01:24:26.827
- no, you get out!
- Listen to me,

01:24:26.829 --> 01:24:29.096
are you listening to me?
- I'm sick and tired of you.

01:24:29.098 --> 01:24:30.164
Listening to you.

01:24:30.166 --> 01:24:30.164
Get out!

01:24:30.166 --> 01:24:32.533
- Don't you talk about my kid.

01:24:32.535 --> 01:24:33.700
- Get out, out!
- I never want you

01:24:33.702 --> 01:24:34.501
to talk about my kid before
- out!

01:24:52.187 --> 01:24:54.121
- In the
wake of hurricane Katrina,

01:24:54.123 --> 01:24:56.356
many parts of New Orleans
are still underwater.

01:24:56.358 --> 01:24:57.858
One encouraging
sign, though, is that

01:24:57.860 --> 01:24:59.460
that it's been two weeks

01:24:59.462 --> 01:25:01.528
since the mayor has
reopened the French quarter

01:25:01.530 --> 01:25:03.230
and we have already
seen a large amount

01:25:03.232 --> 01:25:05.199
of business owners
opening their doors.

01:25:34.762 --> 01:25:36.830
- What can I get for ya?

01:25:38.233 --> 01:25:42.202
- The ragamuffin's prayer
to god be merciful to us.

01:25:44.139 --> 01:25:44.838
What?

01:25:46.274 --> 01:25:48.208
- You all right, man?

01:25:48.210 --> 01:25:50.377
- I, I don't have enough.

01:25:51.746 --> 01:25:55.816
I, I, I got more money
in, in, in my motel room.

01:25:57.218 --> 01:26:00.487
Save this for me, I, I, i
really need it, I need it.

01:26:00.489 --> 01:26:02.189
- Save what for you, man?

01:26:02.191 --> 01:26:04.258
- Oh, and another thing.

01:26:04.260 --> 01:26:07.928
Roslyn, please tell
roslyn I miss her.

01:26:07.930 --> 01:26:08.762
- Who's roslyn?

01:26:35.690 --> 01:26:36.857
- Hi.

01:26:40.229 --> 01:26:41.361
- Hi.

01:26:42.497 --> 01:26:45.265
- You want
one of my hot dogs?

01:26:45.267 --> 01:26:48.735
- Well, that's very nice
of you, I'll be okay.

01:26:48.737 --> 01:26:49.736
- Will you?

01:26:51.940 --> 01:26:52.839
- Charlie!

01:26:53.741 --> 01:26:54.975
Charlie!

01:26:54.977 --> 01:26:57.844
I told you not to
leave my sight.

01:26:57.846 --> 01:26:59.680
- I'm just talking to this man.

01:26:59.682 --> 01:27:02.282
- No, don't look at that filth!

01:27:02.284 --> 01:27:05.252
Come on, you know
better than that.

01:27:08.991 --> 01:27:09.890
Charlie!

01:27:11.492 --> 01:27:13.760
- Hey, what's your name?

01:27:20.635 --> 01:27:23.537
- I'm the one that Jesus loves.

01:27:48.396 --> 01:27:52.399
- Stop playing games,
just tell us the truth.

01:27:56.638 --> 01:28:00.674
- Okay, fine, I hide
bottles everywhere.

01:28:00.676 --> 01:28:04.645
Everything from medicine
cabinets to suitcases.

01:28:08.349 --> 01:28:09.916
Maybe you should check
the plank in your own eye

01:28:09.918 --> 01:28:11.785
before you worry about
the speck in mine.

01:28:11.787 --> 01:28:11.785
- I have your wife on the phone.

01:28:11.787 --> 01:28:15.322
If you're not willing to
tell us the complete truth,

01:28:15.324 --> 01:28:16.690
maybe she can help us.

01:28:16.692 --> 01:28:18.058
- Look, I told you I drink.

01:28:18.060 --> 01:28:19.726
What more do you want from me?

01:28:19.728 --> 01:28:23.730
- Max, have you ever been
unkind to any one your children

01:28:23.732 --> 01:28:24.965
while you were drinking?

01:28:24.967 --> 01:28:27.668
- No more or less
than any other father.

01:28:27.670 --> 01:28:29.403
- Shelley, I got you on speaker.

01:28:29.405 --> 01:28:31.805
Shelley, has Max ever
been unkind to any one

01:28:31.807 --> 01:28:35.676
of your children
while he was drinking?

01:28:35.678 --> 01:28:38.078
- Yes.

01:28:38.080 --> 01:28:40.347
- Come on, shelley, tell us.

01:28:40.349 --> 01:28:43.050
Uh, one night,

01:28:45.420 --> 01:28:49.456
Max was taking our daughter
to go Christmas shopping,

01:28:51.959 --> 01:28:55.395
he stopped at a bar
for a quick drink.

01:28:59.367 --> 01:29:02.936
Four hours later Max
came back to the car.

01:29:06.441 --> 01:29:09.443
They had to amputate
her thumb from frostbite

01:29:09.445 --> 01:29:11.411
and she lost her hearing.

01:29:16.751 --> 01:29:19.386
- I'm sorry, shelley, thank you.

01:29:27.362 --> 01:29:32.399
- Get out of here, Max, I'm
not running rehab for liars!

01:29:37.438 --> 01:29:38.372
Hey, Brennan, looking forward

01:29:38.374 --> 01:29:40.107
to getting out of here tomorrow?

01:29:40.109 --> 01:29:43.577
- I don't wanna lie
to you, absolutely!

01:29:43.579 --> 01:29:46.446
If I have to have another
chicken-fried steak,

01:29:46.448 --> 01:29:47.914
I think I'll take
up drinking again

01:29:47.916 --> 01:29:50.083
just as a matter of principle.

01:29:50.085 --> 01:29:51.718
- Any preaching gigs lined up?

01:29:51.720 --> 01:29:53.854
- No, I don't think I'm
gonna do that anymore.

01:29:53.856 --> 01:29:56.456
I'll do something else.

01:29:56.458 --> 01:30:00.527
- What do you think about
what Max shared today?

01:30:02.864 --> 01:30:04.164
- I envied him.

01:30:07.769 --> 01:30:12.139
- I like you, Brennan, but
you're not fooling anyone.

01:30:12.141 --> 01:30:15.675
You may be sober, but
you're far from honest.

01:30:15.677 --> 01:30:16.910
You don't wanna be
transparent with me?

01:30:16.912 --> 01:30:18.512
That's fine.

01:30:18.514 --> 01:30:20.180
But I'm telling you, please,

01:30:20.182 --> 01:30:22.949
you find someone you can
be honest with, okay?

01:30:22.951 --> 01:30:24.017
Start there.

01:30:36.532 --> 01:30:37.764
- You shouldn't even be here.

01:30:37.766 --> 01:30:39.466
- Just, just give me
five minutes, roz.

01:30:39.468 --> 01:30:42.002
- Oh.
- Just five minutes.

01:30:42.004 --> 01:30:43.904
I'm a liar and a drunk

01:30:46.007 --> 01:30:50.444
and trust me when I tell
you I'm worse than you know.

01:30:50.446 --> 01:30:52.879
But the one thing I know

01:30:52.881 --> 01:30:53.713
more than anything else--

01:30:53.715 --> 01:30:54.614
- what?

01:30:55.583 --> 01:30:56.650
- I'm sorry.

01:31:01.489 --> 01:31:04.458
- Brennan, what all
have you lied about?

01:31:04.460 --> 01:31:07.861
- What scares me the most are
not the lies I can remember

01:31:07.863 --> 01:31:09.629
but those I can't.

01:31:10.765 --> 01:31:13.600
- Well, it doesn't matter
because you're not your sins.

01:31:13.602 --> 01:31:14.534
You know that, right?

01:31:14.536 --> 01:31:15.535
- Yes.

01:31:15.537 --> 01:31:17.070
- You taught me that.

01:31:17.072 --> 01:31:19.639
You know who you are, Brennan.

01:31:19.641 --> 01:31:21.174
- Yes.

01:31:21.176 --> 01:31:23.910
But knowing isn't the hard part.

01:31:27.482 --> 01:31:29.516
I'm gonna let you go, roz.

01:31:31.652 --> 01:31:33.820
- Where are you going?

01:31:39.027 --> 01:31:40.594
Hello, ragamuffin.

01:31:41.229 --> 01:31:43.196
- What are you doing here?

01:31:43.198 --> 01:31:45.732
- I'm here to make amends.

01:31:45.734 --> 01:31:47.067
- Jim, come on.

01:31:47.935 --> 01:31:50.637
Jim's giving his
testimony today.

01:31:52.607 --> 01:31:54.241
- What are you doing here?

01:31:54.243 --> 01:31:56.776
- Jim, you don't
have to do this.

01:31:56.778 --> 01:31:59.513
- No, Jim does have to do this.

01:31:59.515 --> 01:32:01.715
We made a deal; I let
him stay a few weeks,

01:32:01.717 --> 01:32:03.517
he gives his testimony.

01:32:03.519 --> 01:32:05.552
He earns enough money
to go back to San Diego.

01:32:05.554 --> 01:32:07.721
Get in the car, Jim.

01:32:07.723 --> 01:32:08.889
- Jim, Jim!

01:32:08.891 --> 01:32:10.156
- Get in the car, Jim.

01:32:10.158 --> 01:32:11.825
- Jim, why
are you doing this?

01:32:11.827 --> 01:32:13.593
- I have to.

01:32:13.595 --> 01:32:14.928
- You stay outta this, Manning.

01:32:29.610 --> 01:32:32.646
Today's a great day, isn't it?

01:32:32.648 --> 01:32:34.648
Today we have a
special treat for you.

01:32:34.650 --> 01:32:36.983
Well, more of a
special treat for me.

01:32:36.985 --> 01:32:38.785
You all remember Jim?

01:32:39.987 --> 01:32:42.956
Well, the prodigal
son has returned.

01:32:42.958 --> 01:32:45.926
- Thank you, thank you.

01:32:45.928 --> 01:32:48.128
Thank you, stab me in
the face, kill me now.

01:32:48.130 --> 01:32:49.329
- What'd you say?

01:32:49.331 --> 01:32:52.933
- I said, "bless me
now," I just wanna bathe

01:32:52.935 --> 01:32:54.768
in a bathwater of blessing.

01:32:54.770 --> 01:32:56.202
- Amen.

01:32:56.204 --> 01:32:57.671
- You said it, sister,

01:32:57.673 --> 01:32:59.573
- if y'all wouldn't mind,

01:32:59.575 --> 01:33:02.075
Jim would like to come
up and say a few words.

01:33:02.077 --> 01:33:03.677
Come on up, Jim.

01:33:14.723 --> 01:33:15.622
- Hi.

01:33:16.724 --> 01:33:19.960
I don't know how you
do it, um, this is

01:33:23.097 --> 01:33:27.000
not as easy as it looks,
I'll put it that way.

01:33:28.369 --> 01:33:30.670
Oh, um, what specifically
did you want me to say,

01:33:30.672 --> 01:33:33.340
'cause you wanted me
to come up here and--

01:33:33.342 --> 01:33:34.641
- I think you know

01:33:34.643 --> 01:33:36.142
what to say.
- Oh, okay, yeah, um,

01:33:36.144 --> 01:33:39.279
so my dad wanted me to come
up here and talk to you about

01:33:39.281 --> 01:33:41.615
how I had a, a baby once.

01:33:46.020 --> 01:33:47.954
I'll be honest, I don't
know that I can do this.

01:33:47.956 --> 01:33:52.125
I know we, we talked about
this and I was gonna do it.

01:33:52.127 --> 01:33:55.128
- It's okay, relax,
you'll be fine.

01:34:00.635 --> 01:34:01.735
- Um,

01:34:02.903 --> 01:34:07.007
well, I guess if there's
one thing I know is true

01:34:08.376 --> 01:34:12.746
that I could say, I'll say
that I love that little girl

01:34:14.649 --> 01:34:17.017
and there's not a moment that,

01:34:19.687 --> 01:34:22.255
there's not a moment
that goes by that

01:34:22.257 --> 01:34:23.757
I don't wish I was her dad

01:34:25.894 --> 01:34:28.728
and I just miss her every day.

01:34:28.730 --> 01:34:33.066
- Go sit down, son, go,
take a seat, go ahead.

01:34:33.068 --> 01:34:34.234
Go, sit down.

01:34:37.772 --> 01:34:39.739
- Who do you think you are?

01:34:39.741 --> 01:34:42.208
- I'm the one that Jesus loves.

01:34:42.210 --> 01:34:44.177
Put your ass in a seat.

01:34:52.953 --> 01:34:56.756
- The single greatest cause of
atheism today is christians.

01:34:56.758 --> 01:34:59.125
Those who profess Jesus
with their mouths,

01:34:59.127 --> 01:35:01.428
yet deny him with
their lifestyles.

01:35:01.430 --> 01:35:05.699
That is what an unbelieving
world, simply finds

01:35:05.701 --> 01:35:05.699
unbelievable.

01:35:05.701 --> 01:35:10.770
Now, you may think I'm referring
to Jim, pastor mark's kid.

01:35:10.772 --> 01:35:14.374
After all, he claims
to be a Christian,

01:35:14.376 --> 01:35:16.209
but just let's look
at what he did.

01:35:16.211 --> 01:35:19.245
He knocked up his girlfriend,

01:35:19.247 --> 01:35:22.716
and then abandoned
both her and the baby!

01:35:27.888 --> 01:35:28.788
Now,

01:35:30.925 --> 01:35:33.827
before Jim says a word,

01:35:33.829 --> 01:35:35.095
if he chooses to,

01:35:36.297 --> 01:35:38.198
I want to tell you about
my initial encounter

01:35:38.200 --> 01:35:41.367
with this broken,
yet bold young man.

01:35:43.938 --> 01:35:46.172
From the day we first met,

01:35:47.808 --> 01:35:49.175
Jim shared with me

01:35:50.478 --> 01:35:53.446
his gift of vulnerability.

01:35:53.448 --> 01:35:56.816
There was no extinguishing
his transparency.

01:35:56.818 --> 01:35:58.184
Trust me, I tried.

01:35:58.186 --> 01:36:04.424
But as a result of
Jim, figuratively
and almost literally,

01:36:04.426 --> 01:36:07.160
crashing into my life, my
heart has been ravished

01:36:07.162 --> 01:36:10.830
by his scorching honesty
and humble spirit.

01:36:12.199 --> 01:36:15.935
I strongly sense that Jim's
story will someday reveal

01:36:17.404 --> 01:36:21.841
how moral failures often lead
to spiritual transformation.

01:36:23.210 --> 01:36:27.447
Yet, I understand that some
of you are disgusted and angry

01:36:27.449 --> 01:36:30.984
because of the heartache
that Jim has caused you

01:36:30.986 --> 01:36:33.153
and his dad, your pastor.

01:36:34.255 --> 01:36:37.457
So, for that reason, my
brother Jim was asked

01:36:37.459 --> 01:36:40.894
to come here today
to publicly apologize

01:36:40.896 --> 01:36:45.131
for his moral failures and
to ask your forgiveness.

01:36:46.100 --> 01:36:47.834
But let's be honest.

01:36:49.470 --> 01:36:52.138
He's here for a public stoning,

01:36:54.308 --> 01:36:57.143
not the kind of stones that
break your flesh and bones,

01:36:57.145 --> 01:36:59.979
but the socially
acceptable kind,

01:37:01.081 --> 01:37:03.583
the type of stones that
modern christians use

01:37:03.585 --> 01:37:07.854
are rightly called shame,
humiliation and hatred.

01:37:10.191 --> 01:37:14.427
But please, folks, trust me,
Jim's not as bad as you think.

01:37:15.830 --> 01:37:17.030
He's much worse!

01:37:18.399 --> 01:37:22.068
But I can also assure you,
he's not worse than me!

01:37:23.337 --> 01:37:25.038
So, let me ask you this,

01:37:25.040 --> 01:37:28.942
what makes you lovable
in the eyes of god?

01:37:28.944 --> 01:37:31.578
What makes Brennan Manning
lovable in the eyes of god?

01:37:31.580 --> 01:37:35.248
Because 49 years ago i
committed my life to Jesus?

01:37:35.250 --> 01:37:38.017
Does god love me because
I've given the last 42 years

01:37:38.019 --> 01:37:40.587
of my life preaching
the gospel of grace?

01:37:40.589 --> 01:37:43.590
Does god love me because
i tithe to the poor?

01:37:43.592 --> 01:37:46.259
Does god love me because
i spend two hours

01:37:46.261 --> 01:37:48.261
every day in prayer?

01:37:48.263 --> 01:37:51.631
Does god love me because
i work with alcoholics,

01:37:51.633 --> 01:37:54.968
addicts, and those
suffering from aids?

01:37:54.970 --> 01:37:58.171
If I believe that
stuff, I'm a pharisee!

01:37:59.540 --> 01:38:03.610
Brothers and sisters, the
gospel of grace makes clear

01:38:03.612 --> 01:38:06.980
the truth that god
loves us as we are,

01:38:09.116 --> 01:38:11.584
not as we should be,

01:38:11.586 --> 01:38:15.421
because none of us
are as we should be,

01:38:15.423 --> 01:38:19.392
not me, not you, not Jim,
not even pastor mark!

01:38:22.997 --> 01:38:27.533
The idea that god loved me
so deeply and unconditionally

01:38:27.535 --> 01:38:30.536
used to sound like
sheer madness to me.

01:38:30.538 --> 01:38:33.039
And that's because it is!

01:38:33.041 --> 01:38:37.043
He loves in a manner that
defies human comprehension

01:38:37.045 --> 01:38:39.445
and escapes human imitation.

01:38:40.547 --> 01:38:43.316
And that's why I can
stand here tonight

01:38:43.318 --> 01:38:46.653
with rare theological
certainty, and with the power

01:38:46.655 --> 01:38:51.024
and authority of god's
own words and proclaim

01:38:51.026 --> 01:38:55.061
god loves you as you are,
not as you should be,

01:38:55.063 --> 01:38:59.032
because, again, none of
us are as we should be!

01:39:01.235 --> 01:39:04.203
So, do you believe
god loves you?

01:39:04.205 --> 01:39:07.473
Most christians say
they do, but they don't.

01:39:07.475 --> 01:39:09.042
They believe god loves them

01:39:09.044 --> 01:39:11.945
in some vague,
distant, abstract way,

01:39:11.947 --> 01:39:15.415
but they would be hard-pressed
to say the essence

01:39:15.417 --> 01:39:18.217
of their life is a love affair,

01:39:18.219 --> 01:39:21.321
and not a simple love affair,

01:39:21.323 --> 01:39:25.558
but what g.K. Chesterton
called a furious love affair.

01:39:29.129 --> 01:39:32.031
Do you honestly believe
that god loves you

01:39:32.033 --> 01:39:36.002
beyond worthiness,
and unworthiness,

01:39:36.004 --> 01:39:38.071
beyond fidelity and infidelity,

01:39:38.073 --> 01:39:40.073
that he loves you
in the morning sun,

01:39:40.075 --> 01:39:42.108
and in the evening rain?

01:39:42.110 --> 01:39:46.012
Without caution,
regret, boundary, limit,

01:39:46.014 --> 01:39:49.615
breaking point, no
matter what's gone down,

01:39:49.617 --> 01:39:51.751
he can't stop loving you.

01:39:54.355 --> 01:39:55.488
I believe it.

01:39:57.992 --> 01:40:01.060
But I'm a bundle of paradoxes.

01:40:01.062 --> 01:40:04.030
I trust god with all my heart,

01:40:04.032 --> 01:40:07.066
but when I see three hundred
thousand people wiped away

01:40:07.068 --> 01:40:09.102
in a Tsunami in southeast Asia,

01:40:09.104 --> 01:40:11.104
when I see a six-month-old
baby ripped out

01:40:11.106 --> 01:40:15.008
of his mother's arms in a
hurricane named Katrina,

01:40:15.010 --> 01:40:19.278
when I see a nine-year-old
girl raped by a sex maniac,

01:40:19.280 --> 01:40:23.616
or a four-year-old boy
slaughtered by a drunken driver,

01:40:23.618 --> 01:40:25.785
I wonder if god exists.

01:40:25.787 --> 01:40:28.688
I trust him and get discouraged.

01:40:28.690 --> 01:40:33.192
I love and I hate, I feel
bad about feeling good.

01:40:33.194 --> 01:40:36.029
I feel guilty if i
don't feel guilty.

01:40:36.031 --> 01:40:39.065
I'm wide open and I'm locked in.

01:40:39.067 --> 01:40:41.734
I'm trusting and suspicious.

01:40:41.736 --> 01:40:44.804
I'm honest and still play games.

01:40:44.806 --> 01:40:49.075
Aristotle said, "I'm
a rational animal."

01:40:49.077 --> 01:40:53.312
I say I'm an angel with an
incredible capacity for beer.

01:40:54.481 --> 01:40:58.384
Take me or leave me, but
that's the real Brennan.

01:41:00.754 --> 01:41:03.189
Do you remember how I said
that I'm worse than Jim?

01:41:03.191 --> 01:41:08.127
Not too long ago I woke up in
alleyway, in an alcoholic fog.

01:41:08.129 --> 01:41:10.797
If you had seen me that
way, you might have said,

01:41:10.799 --> 01:41:16.169
"don't look at that bum,
all that is, is pure filth!"

01:41:16.171 --> 01:41:17.203
Yet that filth

01:41:18.839 --> 01:41:20.773
was Brennan Manning.

01:41:22.109 --> 01:41:27.146
Yet, the abba of Jesus loved
me as much that morning,

01:41:27.148 --> 01:41:30.850
in that state of
disgrace, as he does now

01:41:30.852 --> 01:41:34.120
in my present state of grace

01:41:34.122 --> 01:41:37.623
for his love is never,
never, never based

01:41:38.725 --> 01:41:41.561
on our performance,
never conditioned

01:41:41.563 --> 01:41:45.198
by our moods of
elation or depression.

01:41:45.200 --> 01:41:48.568
It knows no shadow,
alteration, or change.

01:41:50.204 --> 01:41:54.440
The love of god in Christ
Jesus his son is reliable.

01:41:59.480 --> 01:42:02.849
My friends this isn't
something I read in a book

01:42:02.851 --> 01:42:05.384
or heard in a sermon.

01:42:05.386 --> 01:42:08.221
This is the Jesus
of my own journey,

01:42:08.223 --> 01:42:10.123
the son of compassion.

01:42:11.291 --> 01:42:13.326
When I was ambushed by Jesus

01:42:13.328 --> 01:42:16.529
in a small chapel in
loreto, Pennsylvania,

01:42:16.531 --> 01:42:19.665
in a community of the
little brothers of Jesus

01:42:19.667 --> 01:42:23.736
in the south of France, in
a Swiss prison, in a cave

01:42:23.738 --> 01:42:25.705
in the zaragota desert,

01:42:26.673 --> 01:42:29.175
in the eyes of a small boy,

01:42:31.411 --> 01:42:33.146
in eating ice cream,

01:42:34.248 --> 01:42:35.248
in a smile,

01:42:38.719 --> 01:42:40.153
in friendship.

01:42:44.424 --> 01:42:45.658
Jim asked me, he said,

01:42:45.660 --> 01:42:47.660
"Brennan, do you really believe

01:42:47.662 --> 01:42:50.930
"that god loves you as you
are, and not as you should be?

01:42:50.932 --> 01:42:54.300
"Because none of us
are as we should be."

01:42:54.302 --> 01:42:57.236
The truth is no, but I'm trying.

01:42:58.305 --> 01:43:01.340
My friends, this is
not pious poetry.

01:43:01.342 --> 01:43:03.743
Jesus not only
knows what hurts us,

01:43:03.745 --> 01:43:07.580
but knowing seeks us out
whatever our poverty,

01:43:08.916 --> 01:43:12.652
whatever our pain, his plea
to his people right now,

01:43:13.787 --> 01:43:16.789
his promise to us
is, "come to me."

01:43:18.358 --> 01:43:21.260
Not to church, not
to a Bible study,

01:43:21.262 --> 01:43:24.931
not to an annual
conference, not to a movie,

01:43:24.933 --> 01:43:26.933
but you come to me.

01:43:26.935 --> 01:43:30.503
Come to me as you are
whether you're celibate

01:43:30.505 --> 01:43:33.206
or you're promiscuous,
whether you're married

01:43:33.208 --> 01:43:35.541
or whether you're single,
whether you've had a baby

01:43:35.543 --> 01:43:37.710
out of wedlock or whether
you've judged a guy

01:43:37.712 --> 01:43:40.613
that had a baby out of wedlock.

01:43:40.615 --> 01:43:42.949
Don't wait 'til you got
your head on straight,

01:43:42.951 --> 01:43:47.286
until you get your act together,
'til you're free of sin,

01:43:47.288 --> 01:43:50.389
selfishness, dishonesty,
degraded love,

01:43:52.859 --> 01:43:56.329
but come now, wounded,
frightened, angry,

01:43:57.698 --> 01:44:01.367
lonely, empty, depressed,
tilting towards despair,

01:44:02.736 --> 01:44:05.238
and I'll meet you where you live

01:44:05.240 --> 01:44:08.307
'cause I'm gonna
love you as you are,

01:44:08.309 --> 01:44:09.942
not as you should be,

01:44:11.678 --> 01:44:14.914
'cause none of us
are as we should be.

01:44:23.523 --> 01:44:26.325
As St. Francis of assisi
said to brother Dominic

01:44:26.327 --> 01:44:28.728
as he was leaving umbria,

01:44:28.730 --> 01:44:29.629
"bye."

01:45:38.565 --> 01:45:39.498
- Hey,
Brennan, you in here?

01:45:39.500 --> 01:45:40.399
- In here.

01:45:42.869 --> 01:45:45.871
- Uh oh, is it
someone's nap time?

01:45:45.873 --> 01:45:47.440
- I'm not napping.

01:45:48.709 --> 01:45:49.775
I'm resting.

01:45:52.412 --> 01:45:55.514
- Brennan, we need
to have a talk.

01:45:56.416 --> 01:45:59.585
2 pm is way too
early for bedtime.

01:45:59.587 --> 01:46:01.020
At least wait 'til three.

01:46:01.022 --> 01:46:02.455
- I'm not napping.

01:46:04.592 --> 01:46:08.494
- So, I love what you
have done with the place.

01:46:09.129 --> 01:46:10.563
- Oh, thank you.

01:46:10.565 --> 01:46:12.398
- So,
what are you gonna do?

01:46:12.400 --> 01:46:14.800
- Moving to Jersey with my
sweetie pie sister Gerry,

01:46:14.802 --> 01:46:16.502
and my brother-in-law, art.

01:46:16.504 --> 01:46:18.804
- Oh, is that this guy here?

01:46:18.806 --> 01:46:20.573
- Yeah.

01:46:20.575 --> 01:46:22.541
- He looks a little
like Jack Nicholson.

01:46:22.543 --> 01:46:23.609
- He wishes.

01:46:25.145 --> 01:46:27.646
Hey, if you're ever in
Jersey, you look me up.

01:46:27.648 --> 01:46:29.582
- Oh, yeah, I'd love that.

01:46:29.584 --> 01:46:31.117
I actually have an
uncle that lives there.

01:46:31.119 --> 01:46:34.854
Uh, you may have heard
of him, Tony soprano?

01:46:36.623 --> 01:46:38.124
Not a TV guy, huh?

01:46:38.126 --> 01:46:39.759
Well, hey, same goes for you.

01:46:39.761 --> 01:46:41.460
If you're ever in San
Diego, look me up.

01:46:41.462 --> 01:46:42.928
- Yeah, I'll let you
know so you won't have

01:46:42.930 --> 01:46:44.997
to steal a name tag to
sneak into the conference.

01:46:48.002 --> 01:46:51.470
- Well, I guess I'll
let you take a nap.

01:46:51.472 --> 01:46:53.406
- Oh, shut up.

01:46:53.408 --> 01:46:54.106
- Hey,

01:46:56.009 --> 01:46:57.510
um,

01:46:57.512 --> 01:47:00.045
I just wanted to thank you,

01:47:00.047 --> 01:47:02.681
uh, for helpin' me get unstuck.

01:47:04.785 --> 01:47:05.718
- Pound it.

01:47:10.424 --> 01:47:12.625
- I'll see ya down the road.

01:47:15.028 --> 01:47:16.529
- Bye, my friend.

01:47:32.746 --> 01:47:35.181
A nap does sound good.

01:51:01.355 --> 01:51:04.123
- I just wanted the extra
pretzels, it's fine.

01:51:04.125 --> 01:51:05.758
All right, not that cool, guys.

01:51:05.760 --> 01:51:08.927
Someone's dippin'
into my tip jar, tom.

01:51:08.929 --> 01:51:10.763
Tom, stop actin' like
you're passed out.

01:51:10.765 --> 01:51:13.666
I know you're fakin'
it, worst actor.

01:51:13.668 --> 01:51:15.734
Hey, what are you
doin' on Tuesday?

01:51:15.736 --> 01:51:16.702
- Like this Tuesday?

01:51:16.704 --> 01:51:16.702
- Next, next Tuesday.

01:51:16.704 --> 01:51:20.239
- I don't, I don't
know, I work here until 10.

01:51:20.241 --> 01:51:22.708
- Do you wanna come to
an improv, my improv show?

01:51:22.710 --> 01:51:23.676
- You have
an improv show?

01:51:23.678 --> 01:51:25.210
- Yeah.

01:51:25.212 --> 01:51:26.712
- I don't wanna go
to an improv show, Jeremy.

01:51:27.448 --> 01:51:29.181
- No, no, we're not doin' that.

01:51:29.183 --> 01:51:31.383
Guess who's not gettin'
their pretzels now.

01:51:31.385 --> 01:51:32.451
- God.

01:51:33.787 --> 01:51:35.954
- I ate all this butter.

01:51:35.956 --> 01:51:36.855
Brennan.

01:51:38.158 --> 01:51:39.058
Brennan.

01:51:39.060 --> 01:51:43.162
Brennan, I ate all this
butter, what do I do?

01:51:43.164 --> 01:51:44.096
- We're, we're just
really big fans.

01:51:44.098 --> 01:51:45.330
We've read all your books.

01:51:45.332 --> 01:51:47.700
- I, I might stare at
you if that's all right.

01:51:47.702 --> 01:51:49.868
- No, don't stare at me.

01:51:49.870 --> 01:51:53.338
- I mean, it's good
to see Brennan.

01:51:53.340 --> 01:51:54.740
- Wait, you like
Brennan Manning?

01:51:55.976 --> 01:51:57.943
- You guys are idiots.

01:51:57.945 --> 01:52:01.046
- Not your family or
your friends, but you!

01:52:01.048 --> 01:52:04.149
And so on and so on
and so on and so on

01:52:04.151 --> 01:52:05.751
and so on and so on and so on.

01:52:05.753 --> 01:52:07.853
All right, kid, let's get
going, I gotta get outta here.

01:52:08.789 --> 01:52:09.855
- You've been looking old.

01:52:09.857 --> 01:52:11.757
- Oh, at least i
pee standing up.

01:52:13.928 --> 01:52:15.260
- Ah, old man humor.

01:52:16.464 --> 01:52:16.462
- What
planet are you from?

01:52:16.464 --> 01:52:20.432
How do you think
that's gonna help?

01:52:20.434 --> 01:52:23.435
- I'm sorry, are you,
are you really asking me

01:52:23.437 --> 01:52:25.471
what planet I'm from?

01:52:25.473 --> 01:52:26.972
Um, it's earth.

01:52:29.310 --> 01:52:30.476
- I have to go, mom, I think
this old guy's gonna cry.

01:52:31.512 --> 01:52:32.411
- Get in.

01:52:36.783 --> 01:52:38.484
And that's how a
scene goes in acting.

01:52:38.486 --> 01:52:40.385
- That was great.

01:52:40.387 --> 01:52:41.353
- That's gonna kill ya.

01:52:41.355 --> 01:52:43.088
- So will being old.

01:52:44.824 --> 01:52:46.492
- I'm still gonna drink it.

01:52:46.494 --> 01:52:48.093
- Oh.

01:52:52.833 --> 01:52:53.866
Cut.

01:52:53.868 --> 01:52:56.268
In this pretend world.

01:52:59.173 --> 01:53:00.506
Hey, Brennan.

01:53:00.508 --> 01:53:01.340
- Yes?

01:53:07.948 --> 01:53:10.215
- J.B. Is not amused by you.

01:53:10.217 --> 01:53:11.216
- Was it, yeah?

01:53:11.218 --> 01:53:12.384
- That was

01:53:12.386 --> 01:53:13.552
- you got it?

01:53:13.554 --> 01:53:13.552
- Yeah, we
talked, we got to Gracie

01:53:13.554 --> 01:53:16.021
- if you wanna do it again?
- - All right, cool.

01:53:16.023 --> 01:53:16.889
- Let's do it again?

01:53:18.192 --> 01:53:19.124
- Right.

01:53:19.126 --> 01:53:20.526
Good night, kid.

01:53:21.427 --> 01:53:23.328
- Good night, Brennan.

01:53:25.532 --> 01:53:30.369
I'm like thirty, why does
he keep callin' me kid?

01:53:30.371 --> 01:53:33.539
- I'm sorry, I cannot
find the restroom.

01:53:33.541 --> 01:53:36.108
Ooh, where is it again?

01:53:36.110 --> 01:53:37.142
- Oh, you know what?

01:53:37.144 --> 01:53:40.813
Um, I am so sorry

01:53:40.815 --> 01:53:43.882
to be the one to have
to tell you this,

01:53:43.884 --> 01:53:46.552
but there is no hope
for you in this life.

01:53:46.554 --> 01:53:49.254
- Do I have time for a smoke?

01:53:52.926 --> 01:53:54.893
- I'm gonna pretend that
he didn't just say that.

01:53:54.895 --> 01:53:56.528
- Listen, we're a
sketch comedy team

01:53:56.530 --> 01:53:57.863
called the color green

01:53:57.865 --> 01:53:59.598
and we're sorta
wondering if we could go

01:53:59.600 --> 01:54:01.867
on the road with you.

01:54:01.869 --> 01:54:03.836
- What do you think?

01:54:03.838 --> 01:54:05.237
- I think I'm gonna
cut this scene.

01:54:36.336 --> 01:54:39.571
- 'Cause you know
you're a ragamuffin.

01:54:41.541 --> 01:54:45.010
You're not ashamed of
being a ragamuffin.

01:54:47.013 --> 01:54:49.248
You're the beloved of god.
