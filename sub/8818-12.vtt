WEBVTT

00:02.544 --> 00:03.378
- Andi's been a thorn
in my side,

00:03.461 --> 00:04.462
make her docile
and enjoy the ride!

00:04.546 --> 00:06.923
[powers zapping]

00:07.006 --> 00:07.674
Oh!

00:07.757 --> 00:12.345
What just happened?

00:12.429 --> 00:15.181
Andi?

00:15.265 --> 00:17.475
It's so good
to see you, sweetie.

00:17.559 --> 00:20.311
Give me a hug!

00:24.190 --> 00:25.483
- What?

00:25.567 --> 00:27.318
- How long has it been?

00:27.402 --> 00:30.947
- You never left.
What...?

00:31.030 --> 00:35.118
So, you don't remember
any of what just happened?

00:35.201 --> 00:37.120
- My head's a little fuzzy.

00:37.203 --> 00:38.621
I'm sorry,
but no I don't.

00:38.705 --> 00:40.540
- Andi, are you--

00:40.623 --> 00:44.210
Oh, hi, Ruby.

00:44.294 --> 00:46.129
- [squealing]
Kimmy!

00:46.212 --> 00:47.964
- Oh! Oh, come on now!

00:48.047 --> 00:50.925
- It's best to just
let her finish.

00:54.095 --> 00:56.306
- Did you fall and hit
your head recently?

00:56.389 --> 00:57.640
- I don't think so.

00:57.724 --> 00:59.893
Oh, I have a great idea!
- ANDI &amp; KIM: [startle]

00:59.976 --> 01:00.935
- What if you all
come back to my room

01:01.019 --> 01:03.354
and we can friendship
journal?

01:03.438 --> 01:04.147
[excited squeal]

01:06.191 --> 01:09.652
- Hmmm, where did
I put my Tri-Phase

01:09.736 --> 01:12.447
micro-optics energy
Spell Booster?

01:12.530 --> 01:14.240
- Headmaster, I'm sorry
to interrupt,

01:14.324 --> 01:17.952
but someone has stolen my
Disciplinary Incentive Devices.

01:18.036 --> 01:18.995
- Your what?

01:19.078 --> 01:20.246
- My air horns.

01:20.330 --> 01:21.706
Someone keeps
taking my air horns.

01:21.790 --> 01:25.543
- Why do you have air horns?

01:25.627 --> 01:29.005
- They help me mold
the minds of tomorrow today.

01:29.088 --> 01:31.090
I thought I simply misplaced
the first one,

01:31.174 --> 01:33.384
and then the second
one disappeared.

01:33.468 --> 01:38.556
- First my Spell Booster
and then air horns.

01:38.640 --> 01:40.850
Do you have any idea
who could have done this?

01:40.934 --> 01:45.772
- Oh, I know exactly
who stole them--

01:45.855 --> 01:47.482

That's impossible.

02:25.645 --> 02:28.064
- He came by looking
for that "Ruby" girl.

02:28.147 --> 02:30.733
I turned my back for
one second and they were gone.

02:30.817 --> 02:33.444
- Coach Foiler, can I trust you
with sensitive information?

02:33.528 --> 02:36.698
- Of course.

02:36.781 --> 02:38.741
- I'm hunting
a thieving fugitive

02:38.825 --> 02:41.077
that escaped from Limbo.

02:41.161 --> 02:46.583
She was known as
"Malas Manos," "Bad Hands."

02:46.666 --> 02:48.167
Where was Cameron
before he was prefect?

02:48.251 --> 02:50.712
- He was a student
at the Academy.

02:50.795 --> 02:53.506
Not the best student.

02:53.590 --> 02:54.966
Finished at
the bottom of the board.

02:55.049 --> 02:56.926
But he more than
makes up for it now

02:57.010 --> 02:59.345
with his dedication
and enthusiasm.

02:59.429 --> 03:04.267
Leo, may I remind you--
you are looking for a witch.

03:04.350 --> 03:07.312
- Who placed a hex on
her own "Wanted" poster.

03:07.395 --> 03:09.772
Perhaps this fugitive used
a Doppelganger Spell

03:09.856 --> 03:11.816
to impersonate Cameron.

03:16.696 --> 03:18.406
- What is going on?

03:18.489 --> 03:19.574
- Ruby attacked me.

03:19.657 --> 03:20.825
She was chasing me
and throwing magic.

03:20.909 --> 03:22.285
- What? Ruby has powers?

03:22.368 --> 03:23.870
- I don't know.

03:23.953 --> 03:25.038
And then my shield bounced
the Docile Spell

03:25.121 --> 03:27.415
right back at her
and she became

03:27.498 --> 03:29.250
all carnations
and bubblegum.

03:29.334 --> 03:31.127
- Well, why doesn't
she remember anything?

03:31.210 --> 03:33.129
- The amulet in my shield

03:33.212 --> 03:34.631
must have amplified the spell
and jarred her memory somehow.

03:34.714 --> 03:36.257
- KIM: Oh.

03:40.219 --> 03:45.141
- Oh, no, I don't have
any journals.

03:45.224 --> 03:46.809
- Can you make some
with your magic?

03:46.893 --> 03:49.312
- Me?
[laughing]

03:49.395 --> 03:50.855
I don't have any powers.

03:50.939 --> 03:51.814
- Oh, why don't you try?

03:51.898 --> 03:52.982
You know, maybe
they finally developed.

03:53.066 --> 03:58.112
- Okay, silly,
I'll try for you.

03:58.196 --> 03:59.864
Journals, journals,
pink and blue,

03:59.948 --> 04:04.327
one for me
and two for you!

04:04.410 --> 04:06.788
You see? No powers.

04:06.871 --> 04:11.000
But that's okay.
We all have a purpose.

04:11.084 --> 04:13.586
Hey, what if
we paint our toes

04:13.670 --> 04:15.588
and French braid our hair?

04:15.672 --> 04:18.716
- Oh, yeah, that sounds
like so much fun.

04:18.800 --> 04:20.843
But, uh, you know what?

04:20.927 --> 04:22.011
It's getting late.
- KIM: Oh.

04:22.095 --> 04:24.931
Look.
- It's almost, um...

04:25.014 --> 04:26.975
Ooh, 5:00 o'clock.
- Oh...

04:27.058 --> 04:29.936
- Yeah, let's just
call it a night,

04:30.019 --> 04:33.064
and, uh, we can
paint our toes

04:33.147 --> 04:35.733
and French bread hair
in the morning.

04:35.817 --> 04:38.653
- Okay.
[giggling]

04:47.161 --> 04:49.288
Oh, one more hug?

04:49.372 --> 04:51.666
- Uh, I'll take
a rain check.

04:51.749 --> 04:53.876
- RUBY: [whimpers]

04:53.960 --> 04:55.545
- Give her a hug.

04:55.628 --> 04:57.463
- Hm?

05:03.302 --> 05:06.723
- I appreciate you
so much.

05:06.806 --> 05:08.516
- Uh-huh? Okay.

05:08.599 --> 05:11.519
Good night.
Go. Go. Go. Go.

05:13.479 --> 05:16.733
That was like the weirdest
experience of my entire life.

05:16.816 --> 05:18.443
We have to tell Agamemnon.

05:18.526 --> 05:20.069
- And say what?

05:20.153 --> 05:22.530
Ruby's powers are gone and
she doesn't remember anything?

05:22.613 --> 05:24.824
We have to figure out
how she got her powers

05:24.907 --> 05:26.409
before she turns back to normal
and tries to blast me again.

05:26.492 --> 05:29.037
- Hopefully, she won't
draw that much attention

05:29.120 --> 05:30.913
to herself while
we look for the answers.

05:30.997 --> 05:37.754

05:37.837 --> 05:39.756
- Who wants muffins?

05:40.965 --> 05:42.925
- What are you doing?

- Well, I went to
bed so early, I figured

05:45.219 --> 05:47.180
I'd get a jump on the day
and do some baking.

05:47.263 --> 05:49.223

of Realmberries

05:58.191 --> 05:59.776
so every bite's
a "berry-plosion."

it's, you know, light outside?

Sleep tight.

06:12.538 --> 06:15.625
Don't let the bed bugs bite.
[giggling]

06:21.214 --> 06:23.674
- Last night was a nightmare.

06:23.758 --> 06:26.302
- Nightmares only
happen when you're asleep.

06:26.385 --> 06:27.345
This makes no sense.

06:27.428 --> 06:30.014
Even Hex doesn't
have an explanation

06:30.098 --> 06:31.808
for Ruby's sudden loss
and gain of powers.

06:31.891 --> 06:33.976
- Morning, all.

06:34.060 --> 06:36.646
Just, uh, check the box
next to what you want.

06:40.399 --> 06:41.818
- What's this?

06:41.901 --> 06:42.401
- Ruby's pastry cards.

06:42.485 --> 06:44.487
Choose one of three.

06:44.570 --> 06:45.738
- She's making muffins
for the whole Academy?

06:45.822 --> 06:47.907
- Ha! No.

06:47.990 --> 06:51.410
You have your choice of muffins,
croissants or donuts.

06:51.494 --> 06:53.037
- This is the best donut
I've ever had.

06:53.121 --> 06:55.832
- How is this custard
so good?

06:55.915 --> 06:57.500
- She churns it by hand
and then individually

06:57.583 --> 06:59.877
injects the custard
into every donut.

06:59.961 --> 07:03.256
- [palm slaps]

07:04.465 --> 07:07.760
- So much for nobody
noticing she's different.

07:07.844 --> 07:10.513
We have to act fast.

07:10.596 --> 07:11.347
Are you listening to me?

07:11.430 --> 07:13.683
- If you give Ruby
24 hours notice,

07:13.766 --> 07:14.600
she'll make you a quiche.

07:18.146 --> 07:20.148
- Good morning, all.

07:20.231 --> 07:21.858
Today we're gonna tackle
something a little different.

07:21.941 --> 07:23.693
Guardians,
you get to decide

07:23.776 --> 07:26.654
whether your teams work
on improving shields...

07:26.737 --> 07:28.823
or practicing spells.

07:28.906 --> 07:30.867
The time is yours.

07:30.950 --> 07:32.118
Use it wisely.

07:32.201 --> 07:34.579
- Hey, can we talk?

07:34.662 --> 07:36.998
- Oh, yeah, just meet me under
the tree at 4:00 o'clock.

07:38.749 --> 07:40.168
- So, what are we gonna
do--shields or magic?

07:40.251 --> 07:42.920
- Research.
- Huh?

07:43.004 --> 07:43.713
- Meet me in the library.

07:43.796 --> 07:46.090
We have a lot
of work to do.

07:51.137 --> 07:52.263
- JESSIE: What?
Where is she going?

07:52.346 --> 07:55.892
- Why is Ruby
stealing our shield?

07:55.975 --> 07:57.894
- Um...let's find out.

07:59.979 --> 08:02.565
- Agamemnon is going
to distract Cameron

08:02.648 --> 08:04.317
while I search his room.

08:07.278 --> 08:11.073
- I didn't order
five dozen donuts.

08:11.157 --> 08:12.325
I ordered five
dozen muffins.

08:12.408 --> 08:17.079
[patting chin]
Think of the gobbler.

08:17.163 --> 08:18.664
How long will this
take to fix?

08:18.748 --> 08:22.126
- Well, Ruby's training
her WITs, so can't you just...

08:22.210 --> 08:23.961
magically turn
them into muffins?

08:24.045 --> 08:27.048
- I could, but there's
nothing so delicious

08:27.131 --> 08:28.674
as a handmade muffin.

08:28.758 --> 08:33.011
- Well, I guess I get to strap
on the old baker's apron.

08:33.095 --> 08:34.639
- Perfect.

08:37.683 --> 08:40.602
- Ruby?
- What are you doing?

08:40.686 --> 08:42.605
- Ben! Jessie!

08:42.688 --> 08:43.688
- You know our names?

08:43.773 --> 08:45.066
- Of course, I know
your names, sweetie.

08:45.149 --> 08:48.778
How could I not remember
such adorable WITs?

08:55.534 --> 08:58.621
- Why are you giving
our shield a coat?

08:58.704 --> 09:01.457
- It does look
like that, doesn't it?

09:01.540 --> 09:04.126
I mean, what if somebody
hurts themselves on it?

09:04.210 --> 09:06.087
- But the assignment
is to build a shield

09:06.170 --> 09:09.298
that will defend you
against a magic attack.

09:09.382 --> 09:12.343
- And I'm saying, if you deal
with confrontation properly,

09:12.426 --> 09:13.803
it will never come to blows,

09:13.886 --> 09:16.305
and a magic shield
won't be needed.

09:16.389 --> 09:18.891
- So, why does our
shield look like a hamster?

09:18.975 --> 09:20.393
- Well, if talking fails

09:20.476 --> 09:22.144
and your opponent insists
on using aggression,

09:22.228 --> 09:24.730
give him this shield...

09:24.814 --> 09:29.318
and I guarantee this fur
will change his mind.

09:29.402 --> 09:30.152
Just hug it out.

09:30.236 --> 09:32.572
Hug away the rage.

09:35.908 --> 09:38.786
- I, uh...

09:38.869 --> 09:40.371
I could use a deputy.

09:40.454 --> 09:42.540
- I don't rattle
under pressure.

09:47.586 --> 09:52.049
By the power vested in me,
I hereby deputize...

09:52.133 --> 09:53.884
What's your name?
- Amelia.

09:53.968 --> 09:57.305
- I hereby deputize
Amelia Foiler

09:57.388 --> 10:01.100
as a secret,
undercover FRU agent.

10:01.183 --> 10:02.852
- FRU?

10:02.935 --> 10:05.730
- Fugitive Recovery Unit.

10:08.607 --> 10:10.318
- So, what are
we researching?

10:10.401 --> 10:12.987
- I have to look
into how someone

10:13.070 --> 10:14.864
without magic powers
could suddenly gain them.

10:14.947 --> 10:16.532
- Why do you want to--

10:16.615 --> 10:18.617
I mean, what does that have
to do with our assignment?

10:18.701 --> 10:20.703
- It's just a little
background information

10:20.786 --> 10:22.371
I thought would help us.

10:22.455 --> 10:23.956
I'm gonna start down here.
You guys check upstairs.

10:24.040 --> 10:26.584
- ETHAN: Okay.

10:26.667 --> 10:28.794
Emily, you coming?

10:28.878 --> 10:29.628
- Yeah.

10:33.424 --> 10:36.886
- I've been looking
all over for you.

10:36.969 --> 10:38.846
Listen, I'm sorry, okay?

10:38.929 --> 10:40.348
I was gonna meet
you and then--

10:40.431 --> 10:42.224
And then you weren't
wearing your watch

10:42.308 --> 10:44.685
and, uh, all the clocks
in the Academy broke.

10:44.769 --> 10:46.562
I totally understand.

10:46.645 --> 10:48.189
- No, I was trying
to get advice

10:48.272 --> 10:49.482
on how to improve
