00:02.001 --> 00:05.403
<i>Now the story of a wealthy family</i>
<i>who lost everything...</i>

00:05.505 --> 00:07.496
<i>and the one son</i>
<i>who had no choice...</i>

00:07.607 --> 00:09.598
<i>but to keep them all together.</i>

00:15.115 --> 00:16.844
<i>It's</i> Arrested Development.

00:19.352 --> 00:22.753
<i>[Man Narrating] Michael was adjusting</i>
<i>to his new position as vice president...</i>

00:22.856 --> 00:25.416
<i>which meant doing the work of</i>
<i>the president, his brother Gob.</i>

00:25.525 --> 00:27.390
- Michael.
- Hey.

00:27.494 --> 00:30.622
So, did you see the new <i>Poof?</i>

00:31.998 --> 00:34.694
His name's Gary,
and we don't need any more lawsuits.

00:34.801 --> 00:37.964
No, I was talking about the magazine-
Wait. Gary's gay?

00:38.071 --> 00:40.869
- Yeah.
- Uh-oh. He's gonna think I was coming on to him.

00:40.974 --> 00:43.033
You've got a nice mouth.

00:43.143 --> 00:45.134
I'd kill for that ass.

00:45.245 --> 00:47.145
Okay, the chair's
not doing it now...

00:47.247 --> 00:50.080
but lately it's been giving out
as soon as I lean back.

00:50.183 --> 00:53.880
Anyway, I was talking about <i>Poof</i> magazine,
the magazine for magicians.

00:53.987 --> 00:57.616
This guy Tony Wonder bakes himself into
a loaf of bread and pops out of a giant sandwich...

00:57.724 --> 00:59.749
to feed the troops.

01:01.361 --> 01:02.794
I had that idea 10 months ago.

01:02.896 --> 01:04.760
- You had that idea?
- Well, basically.

01:04.864 --> 01:09.164
I was gonna boil myself alive into a chowder
and then be ladled into a giant cauldron...

01:09.269 --> 01:12.238
- to entertain and feed the firemen.
- That's pretty close.

01:12.338 --> 01:14.431
<i>I</i> should be in this <i>Poof!</i>

01:14.541 --> 01:16.771
<i>[Phone Rings]</i>

01:16.876 --> 01:20.175
- Michael Bluth.
- He found him. Ice found your father.

01:20.280 --> 01:22.111
<i>[Narrator] Michael recently</i>
<i>had hired a bounty hunter...</i>

01:22.215 --> 01:24.080
<i>to track down his fugitive father.</i>

01:24.184 --> 01:26.652
- Wh-Where?
- He's coming over here at 5:00 to tell us.

01:26.753 --> 01:28.653
But he wants to get paid first.

01:28.755 --> 01:31.087
Dad goes back to jail,
I can be cleared, I can be president again.

01:31.191 --> 01:35.252
And I'm halfway to getting out of this office
and into a steaming bowl of soup.

01:35.361 --> 01:36.692
- Everybody wins.
- Yeah.

01:36.796 --> 01:40.664
Oscar, close it. You look like
the window of a butcher shop.

01:40.767 --> 01:44.203
- Thank God I can finally get rid of him.
- I'll see you at 5:00, Mom.

01:44.304 --> 01:48.297
<i>[Narrator] Michael then headed down</i>
<i>to the frozen banana stand...</i>

01:48.408 --> 01:51.002
<i>where his son</i>
<i>was supposed to be working.</i>

01:51.111 --> 01:54.103
It just seems like every time we wanna
be together, your father comes along-

01:54.214 --> 01:56.978
Hey, guys. What's going on?
Why's the banana stand closed?

01:57.083 --> 02:00.211
Oh, Ann came to see me,
so I thought I'd take a little break.

02:00.320 --> 02:02.652
- Can we talk about this later?
- Sure. No problem.

02:02.755 --> 02:05.349
Just, let's keep the phone on.
Okay, pal? Great.

02:05.458 --> 02:07.358
- Hey, you.
- [Beep]

02:09.027 --> 02:12.520
See? That's a perfect example of
how your father's always interrup-

02:12.632 --> 02:15.465
<i>[Vibrating]</i>

02:16.603 --> 02:19.504
- I'm sorry.
- [Beep]

02:19.606 --> 02:22.131
- Hello.
- Hey, buddy. They found your grandfather.

02:22.242 --> 02:24.335
- That's what I wanted to tell you.
- That's great.

02:24.444 --> 02:27.470
- I didn't wanna say that
when you were talking to Egg.
- <i>I'm still talking with</i> Ann.

02:27.580 --> 02:31.243
Oh, she's still goin'? Listen,
I'll talk to you later. I'm very excited.

02:31.351 --> 02:33.319
- [Mutters] That's good.
- [Beep]

02:35.255 --> 02:38.190
I think we should break up.

02:38.291 --> 02:40.225
[Coughing Sob]

02:40.326 --> 02:42.226
<i>[Narrator]</i>
<i>The bounty hunter, meanwhile...</i>

02:42.328 --> 02:44.228
<i>was eager to impress</i>
<i>the family attorney.</i>

02:44.330 --> 02:46.195
I cannot believe
that you made these.

02:46.299 --> 02:50.167
<i>Indeed, Ice had always bounty-hunted</i>
<i>to support his first love</i>- 

02:50.270 --> 02:52.568
<i>party-planning.</i>

02:52.672 --> 02:55.106
<i>And Lindsay was still hoping</i>
<i>to score a date with him.</i>

02:55.208 --> 02:59.338
I don't suppose you'd be interested in
catering an affair with me.

02:59.445 --> 03:03.108
Well, when you get a full guest list,
let me know.

03:03.216 --> 03:05.616
Why can't I do this anymore?

03:05.718 --> 03:07.618
That's got to bother you,
huh, Dad?

03:07.720 --> 03:11.622
- I mean, she's flirting right in front of you.
- Hmm? Oh! No.

03:11.724 --> 03:16.991
I am surprised, though, that she's going
after somebody so similar to my own type.

03:17.096 --> 03:21.032
But I suppose we all do expose
our inner desires, don't we?

03:21.134 --> 03:23.034
I think you just did.

03:23.136 --> 03:25.036
No, I didn't.

03:26.272 --> 03:28.467
Is there any way
I can divorce them?

03:28.575 --> 03:30.475
Oh, sure.
It's called emancipation.

03:30.577 --> 03:33.307
But you've got to prove that
you're living in an unstable environment.

03:33.413 --> 03:37.110
Both my parents are trying to have affairs.
Of course, they haven't succeeded yet.

03:37.217 --> 03:40.778
If they do, I could have you out of this house,
on the street, in a month.

03:40.887 --> 03:42.411
- Sweet!
- Mm-hmm.

03:42.522 --> 03:45.491
<i>[Narrator] Soon, Michael arrived,</i>
<i>and Ice began his presentation.</i>

03:45.592 --> 03:49.050
When word got out that he was
building houses for Saddam Hussein...

03:49.162 --> 03:52.825
he escaped to Mexico where, as you know,
he was arrested and interred in a local prison.

03:52.932 --> 03:54.559
Until he was killed by this guard.

03:54.667 --> 03:57.761
<i>Body was held for six days</i>
<i>within the prison walls when</i>- 

03:57.870 --> 04:01.397
- I'm sorry- he killed a guard?
- <i>No, the guard killed him.</i>

04:01.507 --> 04:03.634
He's dead.
Buried in Mexico.

04:03.743 --> 04:08.180
- [Screams]
- Uh, h-hold on. How do we know this is true?

04:08.281 --> 04:11.739
Because I have here his dental records,
his death certificate...

04:11.851 --> 04:15.514
and a political cartoon
from a leading Mexican publication.

04:16.623 --> 04:18.817
<i>Okay, again, I'm a caterer...</i>

04:18.925 --> 04:24.090
so if you do have any family events-
weddings, wakes-

04:24.197 --> 04:26.427
I'll leave my card.

04:26.532 --> 04:28.932
Is it true?

04:29.035 --> 04:31.003
Is he really gone?

04:32.238 --> 04:34.138
- Ow.
- Just checking.

04:34.240 --> 04:37.471
These are his teeth.
He had such perfect teeth.

04:37.577 --> 04:40.307
- It was that Glisten.
- He swore by that Glisten.

04:40.413 --> 04:44.281
I can still hear him now:
"Who left the cap off my- [Bleeps] Glisten?"

04:44.384 --> 04:46.284
<i>[Lucille]</i>
<i>It's all hitting me now.</i>

04:46.386 --> 04:48.445
This is really happening.

04:49.889 --> 04:52.449
All this awful funeral stuff!

04:52.558 --> 04:54.458
<i>The will.</i>
<i>We have to get the will.</i>

04:54.560 --> 04:58.792
I don't know if enough time has passed.
I don't know what I'm saying.

04:58.898 --> 05:01.264
Is it in your car, Barry?
I'm gonna throw up!

05:01.367 --> 05:03.198
Check the car, Barry.
I don't know what I'm saying!

05:03.303 --> 05:05.203
The will is not here.

05:05.305 --> 05:08.706
The will is at my office, next to
the hot plate with the frayed wires.

05:08.808 --> 05:10.708
I didn't, uh- It wasn't-

05:10.810 --> 05:13.711
<i>[Narrator]</i>
<i>In fact, Barry had lost George Sr. 's will.</i>

05:13.813 --> 05:17.510
How did I get here?
Oh, my God, Lucille. He is gone!

05:17.617 --> 05:19.414
We have to have a wake.

05:19.519 --> 05:22.488
<i>[Narrator] Maeby was upset,</i>
<i>but saw a chance to fix up her mother.</i>

05:22.588 --> 05:26.649
Maybe we could get Ice to cater it
or something- I don't know what I'm saying!

05:26.759 --> 05:30.126
- We don't even have a body.
- I will be my father's body.

05:30.930 --> 05:32.830
I'll be the one buried.

05:32.932 --> 05:35.264
Because he loved magic
so very much.

05:35.368 --> 05:38.599
- I don't think Gob knows what he's saying.
- I know exactly what I'm saying.

05:38.705 --> 05:41.105
I will be buried in my father's place...

05:41.207 --> 05:44.699
<i>and then, one week later,</i>
<i>I will emerge from the grave...</i>

05:44.811 --> 05:47.177
in one of the greatest illusions ever!

05:47.280 --> 05:51.216
- This about getting into <i>Poof?</i>
- I mean, how does that <i>not</i> get me a cover?

05:51.317 --> 05:53.285
- <i>[Keys Jingling]</i>
- Buster!

05:53.386 --> 05:56.878
- We can't tell him about this!
- I think the boy's been lied to enough.

05:56.989 --> 05:59.355
You weren't here
for the parakeet, Oscar.

05:59.459 --> 06:02.223
<i>[Narrator]</i>
<i>As a child, Buster had a beloved parakeet...</i>

06:02.328 --> 06:05.764
<i>who, after landing on their</i>
<i>housekeeper Rose's wig, flew away...</i>

06:05.865 --> 06:09.631
- <i>when she took out the trash</i>
<i>and into a transformer.</i>
- <i>[Electrical Zap]</i>

06:09.736 --> 06:13.263
<i>When Buster found out,</i>
<i>he destroyed the family's kitchen...</i>

06:13.373 --> 06:16.900
<i>believing this to be</i>
<i>where Rosa lived.</i>

06:18.878 --> 06:21.711
- Whoa.
- What are you doing home?

06:21.814 --> 06:24.544
The army had half a day.

06:24.650 --> 06:26.845
- Are you guys planning a party?
- Yes.

06:26.953 --> 06:32.391
It's your father's birthday, which,
coincidentally, is... my birthday.

06:32.492 --> 06:35.222
Because you're twins.
[Chuckles]

06:35.328 --> 06:37.455
Well, I've got some shopping to do.
[Laughing]

06:37.563 --> 06:40.464
<i>[Narrator] George Michael,</i>
<i>meanwhile, hadjust been broken up with...</i>

06:40.566 --> 06:42.466
<i>by his first girlfriend...</i>

06:42.568 --> 06:44.695
<i>and was on his way home.</i>

06:49.008 --> 06:51.977
- <i>And he went to his father for comfort.</i>
- Dad?

06:54.881 --> 06:56.849
I've got some bad news.

06:58.017 --> 07:00.315
What? What?
Is Ann telling everyone?

07:00.420 --> 07:02.786
It's your grandfather.

07:02.889 --> 07:05.585
- Apparently, he's dead.
- Are you okay?

07:05.691 --> 07:07.750
Yeah. Yeah, I think so.

07:07.860 --> 07:10.420
Uh, I'm sorry.
What were you saying about Ann?

07:10.530 --> 07:13.431
<i>[Narrator] George Michael didn't want</i>
<i>to burden his father with his break-up.</i>

07:13.533 --> 07:17.367
Nothing. I just- I broke up with her.
It's no big deal.

07:17.470 --> 07:19.028
- Really?
- Yeah.

07:19.138 --> 07:22.107
- Are you okay?
- Me? I'm great.

07:22.208 --> 07:24.108
- Yeah?
- I'm great.

07:24.210 --> 07:26.610
Good. Yeah.
She wasn't for us.

07:26.712 --> 07:28.373
No, she's- she's a great girl.

07:28.481 --> 07:31.473
- For those other guys.
- You think there are other guys?

Come here.

07:36.222 --> 07:38.122
Hey, Brother.

07:38.224 --> 07:40.124
- You wanted to see me?
- Buster, yeah.

07:40.226 --> 07:42.854
I need you to help me with
this illusion I'm working on.

07:42.962 --> 07:45.055
Oh, for Dad's birthday.

07:45.164 --> 07:47.655
Yeah. For Dad's birthday.

07:47.767 --> 07:50.895
So, look, I'm gonna
get in this coffin.

07:51.003 --> 07:55.064
What I'm gonna need you to do
is to spin it around...

07:55.174 --> 07:59.042
to show everybody
that there's no trap door.

07:59.145 --> 08:02.137
<i>Then I'm gonna escape</i>
<i>out the trap door.</i>

08:02.248 --> 08:05.149
- Ooh!
- You close the trap door...

08:05.251 --> 08:08.482
<i>bring in the pallbearers</i>
<i>and bury an empty box.</i>

08:08.588 --> 08:11.148
So it's a <i>hoax.</i>

08:11.257 --> 08:14.158
But why are you doing a coffin trick
on Dad's birthday?

08:14.260 --> 08:15.989
Black humor.

08:16.095 --> 08:20.725
<i>Say, "Hey, Dad, look at you.</i>
<i>You're... a year older...</i>

08:22.301 --> 08:24.769
and a year closer to death."

08:24.871 --> 08:28.170
Oh, yeah, I guess that's kinda funny.

08:28.274 --> 08:31.368
Okay, but you have to
do a favor for me.

08:31.477 --> 08:34.412
I'm not really in the army,
and I told Mom I was...

08:34.514 --> 08:37.414
but I can't go to a family event
without an army uniform.

08:37.517 --> 08:40.452
- Oh, yeah. I used to be a stripper.
- Strippers don't wear clothes.

08:40.553 --> 08:42.043
Not at the end of the show.

08:42.154 --> 08:45.180
You can wear stripper clothes
when you're not stripping?

08:46.559 --> 08:48.527
You tell me.

08:48.628 --> 08:52.291
<i>[Narrator] George Michael</i>
<i>went for a walk in the adjoining lot...</i>

08:52.398 --> 08:54.866
<i>to grieve both losses in private...</i>

08:54.967 --> 08:58.403
<i>and he made</i>
<i>an interesting discovery.</i>

09:00.306 --> 09:03.469
- Pop-Pop?
- Hide me.

09:03.576 --> 09:06.773
Don't turn in Pop-Pop.
Help Pop-Pop.

09:12.418 --> 09:16.878
<i>[Narrator] George Michael snuck his grandfather</i>
<i>into the attic and helped him clean up.</i>

09:16.989 --> 09:20.618
- Wow, they're perfect.
- Years of brushing with Glisten.

09:20.726 --> 09:23.456
Listen, you can't
tell anybody I'm up here.

09:23.563 --> 09:25.463
- You have to protect me.
- Yeah, I know.

09:25.565 --> 09:27.658
- I just- I can't not tell my father.
- I'm your grandfather.

09:27.767 --> 09:29.928
- I went through hell to get here.
- <i>[Narrator] He had.</i>

09:30.036 --> 09:33.904
<i>After being arrested, he found a loophole</i>
<i>in the Mexican judicial system.</i>

09:34.006 --> 09:35.974
I have, uh- I have money.

09:37.009 --> 09:39.409
<i>The Mexican authorities...</i>

09:39.512 --> 09:41.412
<i>even attempted</i>
<i>to fake his funeral...</i>

09:41.514 --> 09:44.677
- <i>although it was</i>
<i>a less-than-perfect deception.</i>
- [Chattering, Shouting]

09:44.784 --> 09:48.618
Anyway, I was halfway down to Panama,
and I saw something in the local paper.

09:48.721 --> 09:50.621
<i>[Narrator]</i>
<i>What he saw was a story...</i>

09:50.723 --> 09:53.624
<i>about his wife giving mouth-to-mouth</i>
<i>to a homeless man.</i>

09:53.726 --> 09:56.957
<i>Bue he knew the truth:</i>
<i>She was kissing his brother.</i>

10:01.801 --> 10:05.669
Well, I understand what that feels like.
I was dumped today.

10:05.771 --> 10:10.333
I can't tell Dad how upset I am about it because
he'll think I should just be upset about you.

10:10.443 --> 10:12.673
- He wouldn't be wrong.
- [Mutters] What?

10:12.778 --> 10:15.679
Seems like we're
going through the same thing.

10:15.781 --> 10:19.547
- Why don't we keep each other's secrets?
- Yeah, okay.

10:20.987 --> 10:24.684
Listen, if you pass a mini-mart,
Pop-Pop gets a treat?

10:26.425 --> 10:28.620
<i>[Narrator]</i>
<i>The next morning...</i>

10:28.728 --> 10:30.855
- <i>Michael ran into his son</i>
<i>doing something suspicious.</i>
- Morning!

10:30.963 --> 10:32.988
- Hi.
- Where are you goin' with that food?

10:33.099 --> 10:37.126
I was just gonna eat some of my
grandfather's favorite foods in my room.

10:37.236 --> 10:39.670
It's the form that my grief is taking.

10:39.772 --> 10:41.706
Okay.

10:45.277 --> 10:48.178
<i>I think George Michael's</i>
<i>hiding Ann in the attic.</i>

10:48.280 --> 10:50.180
[Scoffs]
From who, the Nazis?

10:50.282 --> 10:52.978
<i>No, his girlfriend, from me.</i>

10:53.085 --> 10:55.519
I just caught him
sneaking up to her in the attic...

10:55.621 --> 10:58.715
and he clearly did so
because he thinks I don't approve.

10:58.824 --> 11:01.725
I think I'm gonna
invite her to the wake.

11:01.827 --> 11:04.557
- Why make him hide? Why do to him what-
- [Sniffles]

11:04.664 --> 11:08.225
Why do to him
what Dad used to do to me?

11:08.334 --> 11:11.235
[Sobbing]
He was so amazing.

11:11.337 --> 11:14.238
That was actually an example
of how <i>not</i> so amazing he was.

11:14.340 --> 11:16.570
You're really going
through something here, huh?

11:16.676 --> 11:18.405
I know!

11:18.511 --> 11:21.412
You know, it's funny-
all those years when I pretended to cry...

11:21.514 --> 11:24.415
I used to use Dad's death
to get me going.

11:24.517 --> 11:27.918
I tried it with Mom's, but I'd
just end up smiling and ruining it.

11:28.020 --> 11:30.011
But it feels, like, real.
You know?

11:30.122 --> 11:33.353
And you haven't really allowed yourself
to grieve much at all, Michael.

11:33.459 --> 11:37.361
My relationship with Dad was much more-
much more complicated than yours.

11:37.463 --> 11:42.457
It was predicated a lot on secrets and lies.
There wasn't a lot of trust there.

11:42.568 --> 11:44.297
<i>Here he comes.</i>

11:44.403 --> 11:46.371
Here comes John Wayne.

11:47.773 --> 11:50.970
I'm not gonna cry about my pa.

11:51.077 --> 11:53.978
I'm gonna build an airport,
put my name on it.

11:54.080 --> 11:58.073
Why, Michael?
So you can fly away from your feelings?

11:58.184 --> 12:01.881
<i>You can keep 'em bottled up,</i>
<i>but they will come out, Michael.</i>

12:01.987 --> 12:05.388

<i>for the illusion ofbeing buried alive.</i>

12:22.341 --> 12:25.242
Boy, you sure
got this hole dug out quick.

12:25.344 --> 12:28.245
<i>In fact, the laborer had been hired</i>
<i>by George Sr. Three days earlier...</i>

- What are you doing? Is this what you're wearing?
- My father's dead, Maeby.

12:51.403 --> 12:54.304
Yeah, but you're not,
and Ice is right there.

12:54.406 --> 12:57.534
<i>[Narrator] Maeby knew that if she</i>
<i>could get her mother to have an affair...</i>

12:57.643 --> 12:59.543
<i>she could emancipate.</i>

12:59.645 --> 13:03.775
All Pop-Pop ever wanted was to see you
with another man besides Daddy.

13:03.883 --> 13:05.783
You're right.

13:05.885 --> 13:07.785
You know what?

13:07.887 --> 13:11.550
I'm gonna throw on a skirt, take off my
underwear and make your Pop-Pop proud.

13:11.657 --> 13:14.490
Let me ask Barry.
That might be enough right there.

13:17.196 --> 13:19.096
Is Oscar wearing my suit?

13:19.198 --> 13:21.098
Hey-

13:21.200 --> 13:24.363
You tell my brother
you don't wear a dead man's pants.

13:24.470 --> 13:27.701
Shame on him. And you say that to him.
You say, "Shame on you."

13:27.807 --> 13:30.742
- Okay.
- Say it to me like you're gonna say it to him.

13:30.843 --> 13:33.243
I'm probably not
gonna say it to him.

13:33.345 --> 13:35.245
Okay.

13:35.347 --> 13:38.077
Look at her down there.
Does she look sad to you?

13:38.184 --> 13:40.084
- Oh, my God. That's Ann.
- Who?

13:40.186 --> 13:42.586
It's the girl
who ripped my heart out...

13:42.688 --> 13:45.919
the girl whose face
will always be etched in my mind.

13:46.025 --> 13:47.993
Her?

13:49.695 --> 13:51.595
She's really funny.

13:51.697 --> 13:54.257
Well, let's hope so.

13:54.366 --> 13:55.993
<i>Don't forget the chicken wings!</i>

13:56.101 --> 13:59.070
Hey! Ann!
You're here. That's great.

13:59.171 --> 14:02.231
- I wasn't sure whether you got my message.
- It wasn't a message.

14:02.341 --> 14:05.276
- We talked.
- Uh, Ann?

14:06.278 --> 14:08.246
Did Dad invite you?

14:08.347 --> 14:12.511
I figured life's too short. You two care for
each other. Why throw that away? Huh?

14:12.618 --> 14:15.485
Huh? Okay.

14:17.523 --> 14:20.617
- Do you think we really do?
- A father can tell. Okay?

14:20.726 --> 14:23.752
It's as Ann as the nose on Plain's face.

14:23.863 --> 14:25.763
<i>[Narrator]</i>
<i>And Buster arrived...</i>

14:25.865 --> 14:28.425
<i>dressed in the military outfit</i>
<i>Gob had procured for him.</i>

14:28.534 --> 14:31.332
- What the hell are you wearing?
- It's all regulation, Michael.

14:31.437 --> 14:34.039
To get the top right,
the pants had to be a little snug.

14:34.039 --> 14:35.233

Hmm?

14:38.010 --> 14:39.910
A birthday gift pile?

14:40.012 --> 14:43.379
<i>[Narrator] Michael recalled what Buster</i>
<i>did to what he thought was Rose's car...</i>

<i>Hey!</i>

14:49.221 --> 14:53.487
- Yours is the first.
- And the most wicked. [Giggles]

14:53.592 --> 14:56.755
Get him out of here.
We can't let him know it's a wake.

14:56.862 --> 14:58.762
<i>Buster!</i>

14:58.864 --> 15:03.301
- Let's go get that coffin ready to be buried.
- [Both Laughing]

15:03.402 --> 15:06.462
<i>[Narrator] And so the family</i>
<i>gathered to remember George Sr.</i>

15:06.572 --> 15:10.167
<i>If anyone would</i>
<i>like to say anything about Dad...</i>

15:10.276 --> 15:12.244
now's the time.

15:15.214 --> 15:17.739
- Anyone.
- Anyone?

15:17.850 --> 15:21.877
Perhaps my son George Michael
would like to say something.

15:21.987 --> 15:24.854
Huh? Wanna share
your feelings? Eh?

15:24.957 --> 15:28.120
- It's okay to cry, pal. It's okay.
- Yeah?

15:28.227 --> 15:31.128
Wow.
He's really gone.

15:32.464 --> 15:37.231
<i>But I think that ifhe</i>
<i>was here right now...</i>

15:37.336 --> 15:41.295
I would probably tell him
that it all worked out...

15:41.407 --> 15:44.308
<i>and</i> that, um...

15:44.410 --> 15:47.846

<i>[Narrator] Lindsay got up to speak</i>
<i>in an outfit her daughter had chosen.</i>

15:57.489 --> 16:00.014
My father meant the world to me.

16:00.125 --> 16:03.026
- [Sniffles]
- Wipe, Mom. Give it a wipe.

16:03.128 --> 16:04.891
That's a home run.

16:04.997 --> 16:07.898
<i>[Narrator]</i>
<i>And finally, Michael got up to speak.</i>

16:08.000 --> 16:10.901
I had a very complicated relationship
with my father.

16:11.003 --> 16:12.903
<i>[Blender Whirring]</i>

16:13.005 --> 16:16.497
Ice, can we- can we just cool it
on the smoothies for right now?

16:16.608 --> 16:18.872
There are smoothies?

16:18.978 --> 16:20.878
I could never trust my father.

16:20.980 --> 16:24.143
But I always want my son
to be able to trust me...

16:24.249 --> 16:26.809
so from now on...

16:26.919 --> 16:29.479
we're always gonna be
honest with each other.

16:30.589 --> 16:32.147
Okay?

16:32.257 --> 16:37.217
'Cause there's nobody I love
more than you in this whole world.

16:40.265 --> 16:43.098
Michael, listen, can we
move the eulogy outside...

16:43.202 --> 16:46.933
so I can time being lowered into
Dad's grave with your big finish?

16:47.039 --> 16:49.564
- I'm done.
- Wow. That was your eulogy?

16:49.675 --> 16:52.075
Glad Dad wasn't around
to see that.

16:53.512 --> 16:55.912
- That was great.
- Well, I meant it.

16:56.015 --> 16:59.416
So no more secret trips
up to the attic. Right?

16:59.518 --> 17:01.918
<i>[Narrator] George Michael</i>
<i>didn't want to betray his grandfather...</i>

<i>but it appeared his father</i>
<i>already knew the truth.</i>

17:04.990 --> 17:08.084
- I have Pop-Pop in the attic.
- What?

17:08.193 --> 17:11.219
The mere fact that you call making love
"pop-pop" tells me you're not ready.

<i>Hey!</i>
<i>Before we lose the sun!</i>

17:13.898 --> 17:15.867

Take me halfway around.

17:56.608 --> 17:59.076
[Grunting]

18:00.646 --> 18:03.114

I'm sorry. I'm not gonna let you
