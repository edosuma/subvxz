<i>NARRATOR". We have previously seen
in a fancy new restaurant run by an old friend...</i>

00:18.520 --> 00:20.605
<i>...a gay dinner party...</i>

00:20.813 --> 00:24.025
<i>...interrupted by a shocking
and senseless theft.</i>

00:24.901 --> 00:26.653
<i>Caught red-handed.</i>

00:26.861 --> 00:32.241
<i>Too red-handed. It could have been a plot.
Better call Batman.</i>

00:32.408 --> 00:35.119
<i>Strange, he wants to be arrested.</i>

00:40.124 --> 00:42.502
<i>So let him go.</i>

00:44.629 --> 00:47.966
<i>Spy on him, find out his plans.</i>

00:48.174 --> 00:50.802
<i>Cold-blooded murder.</i>

00:51.302 --> 00:54.973
<i>A fake. Another attempt to get into the pen.</i>

00:55.181 --> 00:59.686
<i>What? A super-crook like him
in a mere city jail?</i>

01:00.228 --> 01:01.479
<i>What's his scheme?</i>

01:01.688 --> 01:06.192
<i>Got it. He wanted to contact a forger
who's doing time.</i>

01:06.359 --> 01:09.529
<i>But Penguin broke out of jail.</i>

01:10.572 --> 01:13.616
<i>Snatched Chief O'Hara as a hostage.</i>

01:14.158 --> 01:16.995
<i>Challenged the Dynamic Duo to a fair duel.</i>

01:18.454 --> 01:22.584
<i>A fair duel? With that crooked bird?</i>

01:23.918 --> 01:26.087
O'Hara in a trunk.

01:27.130 --> 01:30.300
<i>Deadly Penguin guns waiting.</i>

01:31.634 --> 01:34.846
<i>High-voltage electric cables into the pool.</i>

01:35.013 --> 01:38.474
<i>Shut your eyes. Hold your breath.</i>

01:38.683 --> 01:42.770
<i>In just one minute,
the gunfire is going to blast.</i>

03:18.074 --> 03:20.201
Look! That trunk on the slide.

03:21.077 --> 03:22.745
Push it.

03:25.415 --> 03:28.042
- Holy Davy Jones!
-Hold it.

03:28.376 --> 03:29.585
This could be a deathtrap.

03:30.086 --> 03:32.296
- Fire!
-Down! Bat Shield.

03:36.134 --> 03:39.137
Holy Guadalcanal, Batman. What now?

03:39.345 --> 03:43.808
Stay calm.
Let's assess this desperate situation.

03:47.395 --> 03:50.565
Dollars to doughnuts,
Chief O'Hara's in that trunk.

03:50.773 --> 03:54.152
And look! There's Penguin
at that electric switch.

03:54.360 --> 03:56.904
Right. First thing...

03:57.113 --> 04:01.534
...drive the bird away with a Bat-pellet.

04:05.538 --> 04:07.373
Nice eye, Batman.

04:07.582 --> 04:09.876
No time for compliments, I'm afraid.

04:10.084 --> 04:13.504
Let's advance our Bat Shield
through this deadly gunfire.

04:13.713 --> 04:16.591
- Make for those big electric cables.
-Right you are.

04:27.727 --> 04:30.646
What do we do?
Cut them with our Insulated Bat-clippers?

04:30.855 --> 04:37.195
On the contrary. I'll reverse the polarity
with my special Bat-inverser.

04:38.321 --> 04:40.823
Oh! I'm blinded.

04:41.032 --> 04:43.659
Those dratted bat fellas.

04:43.826 --> 04:46.579
Watch it. Someone's getting back
to that electric switch.

04:46.788 --> 04:50.583
Indeed. Just as I'd hoped. Get back.

04:51.667 --> 04:55.296
All right, fry, Chief O'Hara.

04:55.505 --> 04:59.634
You fry and sizzle and boil.

05:06.432 --> 05:08.309
Holy levitation. How did that happen?

05:08.518 --> 05:10.853
Simple.
By reversing the polarity of the cables...

05:11.062 --> 05:14.899
...I transformed the swimming pool
into a gigantic antimagnet.

05:15.107 --> 05:16.818
It repelled the metal of the trunk.

05:17.026 --> 05:19.403
Curses. We're out of ammunition!

05:19.612 --> 05:22.240
It's a trick to get us out
from behind our Bat Shield.

05:22.448 --> 05:26.494
- No trick, Robin. They are out of ammunition.
-How do you know?

05:26.702 --> 05:31.374
Easy. I've been counting their bullets.
At them.

05:31.582 --> 05:33.918
Surrender, you criminals.

05:37.797 --> 05:40.633
- Up with your flippers!
-Quack.

05:40.800 --> 05:42.844
Open the trunk. Release Chief O'Hara.

05:43.010 --> 05:44.011
Roger.

05:50.268 --> 05:52.019
- Are you all right?
-Whew.

05:52.186 --> 05:54.272
Drat it! It's most irritating.

05:54.480 --> 05:57.066
A perfect plot gone awry.

05:57.275 --> 05:59.902
It'll happen to the criminal every time,
Penguin.

06:00.111 --> 06:02.154
Get set for a short flight.

06:02.363 --> 06:06.117
- Next stop for you, the bar of justice.
-Quack.

06:09.036 --> 06:10.079
Next case, bailiff.

06:10.288 --> 06:13.666
An arraignment, Your Honor.
Mr. Penguin and his rascally restaurateurs.

06:13.875 --> 06:16.669
- On what charge?
-Various, Your Honor.

06:16.878 --> 06:18.546
"Kidnapping of a police chief...

06:18.713 --> 06:21.841
...illegal electrification of a swimming pool...

06:22.049 --> 06:25.177
...littering public property
with machine gun cartridges...

06:25.386 --> 06:27.471
...without proper license therefore...

06:27.680 --> 06:31.267
...attempted murder, mayhem, battery...

06:31.475 --> 06:33.060
...and compound assault."

06:33.269 --> 06:35.980
Dear me, most serious.

06:36.188 --> 06:39.817
Where's Mr. Jefferson Hamfurter,
the district attorney?

06:40.026 --> 06:42.528
With your permission, Judge Moot...

06:42.737 --> 06:46.240
...Mr. Hamfurter has asked me
to represent the people.

06:46.449 --> 06:49.785
Of course. It will be an honor, Batman.

06:49.994 --> 06:54.373
Will the prisoner Penguin rise
and state how he pleads?

07:01.672 --> 07:05.092
In the immortal phrase of Emile Zola:

07:05.801 --> 07:07.261
<i>J 'accuse!</i>

07:08.930 --> 07:10.765
What? You accuse?

07:10.973 --> 07:12.224
Indeed, Your Honor.

07:12.433 --> 07:14.727
I accuse Batman and Robin...

07:14.936 --> 07:16.979
...and the Gotham City Police Department...

07:17.188 --> 07:22.109
...with conspiracy to deprive me
of my lawful rights.

07:22.318 --> 07:23.861
You got that?

07:24.070 --> 07:26.781
On what facts do you base your grave charge,
Mr. Penguin?

07:26.989 --> 07:29.116
Well, early yesterday evening, Your Honor...

07:29.325 --> 07:34.205
...I was apprehended in the act
of heisting a diamond bracelet...

07:34.413 --> 07:37.166
...from the wrist of one Mrs. Harriet Cooper.

07:37.375 --> 07:40.753
And although my guilt was manifest...

07:40.962 --> 07:43.631
...Batman and Robin prevented my arrest.

07:43.839 --> 07:46.425
Astonishing. What do you say, Batman?

07:46.592 --> 07:48.302
It's quite true, Your Honor.

07:48.511 --> 07:50.721
I felt in this peculiar situation--

07:50.930 --> 07:52.473
He felt, he felt!

07:52.682 --> 07:55.476
Under what do we live in Gotham City, sir?

07:55.685 --> 07:57.436
We live under a code of law...

07:57.645 --> 08:01.399
...or do we live
under a costumed madman's feelings?

08:01.565 --> 08:04.276
Point well taken, Mr. Penguin.

08:04.485 --> 08:05.903
Thank you, Your Honor.

08:06.112 --> 08:09.532
- Your Honor, I object to--
Objection overruled.

08:09.740 --> 08:10.992
Continue, Mr. Penguin.

08:11.200 --> 08:12.493
Thank you, sir.

08:12.702 --> 08:14.996
As a law-breaking citizen...

08:15.204 --> 08:19.792
...I had and I have a clear right
of admission...

08:20.001 --> 08:22.461
...into the Gotham State Penitentiary.

08:22.628 --> 08:24.422
Quite so. Quite so.

08:24.630 --> 08:28.092
Now, deprived of those rights,
I had no other recourse...

08:28.300 --> 08:33.722
...but to protect myself
by any means at my disposal.

08:33.889 --> 08:35.683
<i>Hmm. Mm.</i>

08:35.850 --> 08:38.644
In other words,
the acts of which you're accused...

08:38.852 --> 08:42.565
...were merely a citizen's reaction
to illegal police conspiracy?

08:42.773 --> 08:47.862
Solomon himself could've put it
in no neater nutshell, Your Honor.

08:48.070 --> 08:50.114
But, Your Honor, kidnapping, mayhem...

08:50.322 --> 08:52.950
...the attempted drowning
of our beloved police chief.

08:53.159 --> 08:55.494
Holy flip-flop, what's happened to justice?

08:55.703 --> 08:59.165
You call attempted mayhem
a "normal citizen's reaction"?

09:00.082 --> 09:04.253
Enough, Boy Wonder. I fear you're out
of your depth in these thorny matters.

09:04.462 --> 09:05.796
Way, way out.

09:06.005 --> 09:10.801
Ahem. Now, our code of law
is the cornerstone of our society.

09:11.010 --> 09:13.971
Whenever it is violated
by those sworn to uphold it...

09:14.180 --> 09:16.307
...which you clearly did, Batman...

09:16.515 --> 09:20.519
...then what recourse has the humble citizen
but action?

09:21.062 --> 09:24.273
Now, which of us is to cast the first stone?

09:25.524 --> 09:28.194
We've been outwitted, Robin.

09:28.402 --> 09:31.530
It's not fair. Let's fight.

09:32.531 --> 09:36.202
Another day, another way.

09:36.702 --> 09:40.664
Your Honor, the people withdraw their case.

09:40.873 --> 09:43.542
Very well. Dismiss the charges.

09:43.751 --> 09:46.921
Release Mr. Penguin
and his rascally restaurateurs.

09:50.591 --> 09:54.095
Do you mean that you are not sending me
to the state pen?

09:54.303 --> 09:58.808
No. Your eloquence has gained you freedom,
Mr. Penguin.

09:59.016 --> 10:02.853
Now fly the straight and narrow path
forevermore.

10:03.062 --> 10:05.106
Faugh.

10:12.321 --> 10:16.867
This is one plan Penguin won't twist.

10:17.076 --> 10:19.453
There. That ought to do it.

10:19.662 --> 10:21.497
Remarkable indeed, sir.

10:21.705 --> 10:24.917
You can say that again.
I bet Batman's the only one in the world...

10:25.084 --> 10:27.711
...with a hand steady enough
to paint false fingerprints.

10:27.878 --> 10:29.547
Come, come, Robin, don't exaggerate.

10:29.713 --> 10:33.801
All it takes is a little practice
and a bit of patience.

10:34.009 --> 10:37.096
Fortunate the criminal classes
don't realize the possibilities.

10:37.304 --> 10:39.807
It wouldn't help them if they did, Alfred.

10:40.015 --> 10:44.478
The poor wretches are addicted
to tobacco and alcohol.

10:44.687 --> 10:48.691
They lack the nerve control
for this sort of work.

10:50.359 --> 10:51.652
You know your role?

10:51.861 --> 10:54.071
I've committed it to memory by rote, sir.

10:54.280 --> 10:57.491
So proceed to The Penguin's Nest.
Good luck.

10:57.700 --> 11:01.745
- It's a privilege to be of help, sir. Good day.
- Ah, ah, ah.

11:01.912 --> 11:06.125
Don't touch anything
for a minute and 23 seconds. Remember.

11:06.333 --> 11:08.627
Very good, sir. Yes.

11:08.836 --> 11:13.465
Robin, would you get me police headquarters
via the special tip line, please?

11:13.674 --> 11:15.426
Roger.

11:22.141 --> 11:24.894
-It's ringing.
-Good.

11:27.771 --> 11:30.107
<i>Police</i> headquarters.

11:30.566 --> 11:32.818
This is a friend speaking.

11:35.905 --> 11:37.239
There's trouble at Table 7.

11:37.448 --> 11:40.993
What now? Some nitwit complaining
about a fly in his caviar?

11:41.202 --> 11:44.038
- Police trouble.
-Police? What do you mean?

11:44.246 --> 11:46.207
That bonehead chief flatfoot.

11:46.415 --> 11:49.168
The one that we tried to bump off in the trunk.
Better have a look.

11:53.797 --> 11:55.090
But, my dear chap...

11:55.299 --> 11:58.928
Don't you "dear chap" me,
Mr. Quill-Pen Quertch.

11:59.136 --> 12:01.764
-"Quill-Pen Quertch"?
-Who's he?

12:01.931 --> 12:04.475
Heh-heh-heh. My pretty brainless birdie...

12:04.683 --> 12:08.938
...he's merely the most brilliant
criminal penman who ever lived.

12:09.146 --> 12:11.398
What an astonishing stroke of luck.

12:11.899 --> 12:14.777
Get out of town, Quill-Pen.

12:14.985 --> 12:19.490
As St. Paddy said to the snakes
in dear old Ireland, "Out."

12:19.698 --> 12:21.116
I give you three hours.

12:21.325 --> 12:24.787
Or is it too neat to be a stroke of luck?

12:24.995 --> 12:26.914
You're right. It might be a trap.

12:27.122 --> 12:30.501
Chickadee, get the gentleman's fingerprints.

12:30.709 --> 12:33.295
Mr. Dee, come with me. Quack, quack.

12:37.049 --> 12:39.510
Ah, fingerprints.

12:39.718 --> 12:45.307
Famous Forgers, International.

12:45.474 --> 12:49.520
- Ah! Here we are.
-His water glass, Pengy.

12:49.728 --> 12:51.689
Well done, my sweet.

13:08.455 --> 13:10.332
Mm-hm.

13:10.499 --> 13:13.377
Right index finger.

13:13.585 --> 13:16.630
Can you read me Quertch's classification
in the file?

13:16.839 --> 13:20.301
"Twelve-R-seven-one-Q-six."

13:20.509 --> 13:23.554
--seven-one-Q-six.

13:23.762 --> 13:25.306
Eureka!

13:25.514 --> 13:28.517
It's Quill-Pen, after all. Shh.

13:37.276 --> 13:40.362
Your host and colleague, Mr. Quertch.

13:40.571 --> 13:44.533
That brainy bird of prey, the Penguin.

13:44.742 --> 13:46.994
- I'm honored, Comrade Penguin.
-Heh, heh.

13:47.202 --> 13:49.121
Oh, yeah, that's right.

13:49.330 --> 13:53.375
Now, uh, allow me to suggest...

13:53.584 --> 13:56.670
...a mutually profitable collaboration.

13:56.879 --> 13:58.505
By all means, old bird.

13:59.798 --> 14:01.050
What's the setup?

14:01.258 --> 14:07.348
You see, it happens
that I have very cleverly got hold of--

14:10.726 --> 14:12.936
- Curious.
- Huh?

14:13.687 --> 14:18.359
Uh, I have a strange feeling
that I have seen you somewhere before...

14:18.567 --> 14:20.486
...Mr. Quertch.
-Heh.

14:20.736 --> 14:23.781
Well, perhaps my--
My phiz in the Rogue's Gallery, what?

14:24.365 --> 14:26.950
No, I don't think so.

14:27.368 --> 14:29.870
Great heavenly ice floes!

14:33.624 --> 14:37.086
Mercy me! Oh, the poor man has fainted.

14:37.294 --> 14:41.173
Ladies and gentlemen,
friends of The Penguin's Nest...

14:41.382 --> 14:44.551
...I regret to announce the outbreak
of a sudden epidemic:

14:44.760 --> 14:47.304
Moldavian food poisoning.

14:47.513 --> 14:49.807
I suggest, while you can...

14:50.015 --> 14:53.018
...run for your lives
to your favorite family physician.

14:59.733 --> 15:01.610
- What's happened?
-Who is he, Pengy?

15:01.819 --> 15:03.070
He's an impostor.

15:03.278 --> 15:07.783
I recognize him as a busybody
who has stumbled into my stew before.

15:07.991 --> 15:10.285
His name is Alfred.

15:10.494 --> 15:14.248
He is the faithful butler
of the millionaire Bruce Wayne.

15:18.585 --> 15:19.795
I don't like it.

15:20.003 --> 15:22.589
He should have checked in
five minutes ago.

15:22.798 --> 15:25.384
Gosh, do you think Penguin's seen
through our ploy?

15:25.592 --> 15:26.844
I don't know.

15:27.052 --> 15:32.224
But I may have made a grave mistake
in sending Alfred to that devil's lair.

15:32.516 --> 15:34.393
Come on, Robin, quick!

15:38.689 --> 15:42.860
I don't get it. Why should Bruce Wayne's butler
be wearing a set of phony fingerprints?

15:43.068 --> 15:44.653
Alas, it's too simple.

15:44.862 --> 15:47.990
See, Mr. Wayne
is a very prominent bank director...

15:48.198 --> 15:51.910
...and they have got wind
of my super-crooked forgery scheme...

15:52.119 --> 15:57.040
...and this is a counterplot laid
by the Gotham City League of Bankers.

15:57.249 --> 16:00.335
- Yeah. Yeah, that figures.
-So, what do we do?

16:00.544 --> 16:05.257
I am brainy. I am nimble. I am versatile.

16:05.466 --> 16:09.553
This Bruce Wayne will pay dearly
for his clumsy interfer--

16:10.471 --> 16:13.849
Mr. Blue. Mr. Blue.

16:14.057 --> 16:18.854
I want you to prepare
50 pounds of piecrust.

16:19.062 --> 16:24.651
We are going to make
a gigantic butler pie. Heh!

16:33.118 --> 16:34.953
Sinister.

16:35.287 --> 16:38.207
This could be a crude attempt
to throw us off.

16:38.415 --> 16:40.125
There's no one in the dining room.

16:40.334 --> 16:44.046
There may be someone in the kitchen.
Let's find out.

17:10.864 --> 17:13.951
Alfred's bowler.

17:15.368 --> 17:18.747
Heavily dusted with pastry flour.

17:18.955 --> 17:23.167
Holy chocolate éclair.
What can it mean, Batman?

17:23.835 --> 17:25.963
I scarcely dare think.

17:26.171 --> 17:30.217
I fear it's too grim.

17:33.136 --> 17:35.847
Who are you? What's the meaning of this?

17:36.390 --> 17:38.308
It's a catered affair, madam.

17:38.517 --> 17:42.062
- In honor of Mr. Bruce Wayne. Is he home?
-No.

17:42.271 --> 17:43.438
We'll wait.

17:43.647 --> 17:47.192
You get out of here.
You get out of here at once.

17:47.401 --> 17:49.528
Shoo, you hideous creatures! Shoo!

17:51.989 --> 17:53.740
Answer it.

17:55.075 --> 17:56.910
Answer it.

18:00.330 --> 18:01.873
Hello?

18:02.082 --> 18:04.459
Hi there, Aunt Harriet. It's Dick.

18:04.668 --> 18:08.380
Bruce and I were just wondering
if there's anything new around the house.

18:08.589 --> 18:12.134
Well, yes, I'd say there certainly is.

18:12.301 --> 18:16.138
Eh. Hello? This is Mr. P. N. Guin.

18:18.390 --> 18:22.394
- Penguin, you--
-Careful. You're Dick Grayson.

18:22.978 --> 18:24.605
You mean the Penguin?

18:24.813 --> 18:27.691
The famous criminal
I've read so much about?

18:27.899 --> 18:29.943
That's who I mean, Dicky boy.

18:30.152 --> 18:35.032
And you better tell your guardian, Mr. Wayne,
that if he wants to see Alfred alive...

18:35.616 --> 18:38.410
<i>...he'd better hurry home fast.</i>

18:38.619 --> 18:40.787
Quick. To the Batmobile.

19:01.433 --> 19:05.979
Ah, there you are, Mr. Wayne.
Good day, Mr. Wayne.

19:06.188 --> 19:10.359
And good day, my boy. Welcome.
Welcome, the both of you. Heh.

19:10.525 --> 19:14.529
- Why, what an extraordinary pastry.
-The biggest I've ever seen.

19:14.738 --> 19:17.866
Yes, its name is Humble Pie, Mr. Wayne.

19:18.075 --> 19:21.036
- And you are about to eat it.
-You don't say.

19:21.244 --> 19:24.456
Yes. Mr. Blue, prepare to light the burner.

19:24.665 --> 19:28.085
Now, inside that pie is Quill-Pen Quertch...

19:28.293 --> 19:30.003
...the famous British forger.

19:30.212 --> 19:32.631
- Why, you--
-Steady, Dick, I'll handle this.

19:32.839 --> 19:35.217
And he will be cooked
before your very eyes...

19:35.425 --> 19:38.637
...millionaire Bruce Wayne,
the banker's friend.

19:38.845 --> 19:40.806
Unless you compensate me...

19:41.014 --> 19:45.936
...to the tune of $1 million cash. Now.

19:46.770 --> 19:48.355
A million.

19:49.147 --> 19:53.860
I believe I have that sum on hand
in the small wall safe in my study.

19:54.069 --> 19:55.445
Come on, I'll help you get it out.

20:11.336 --> 20:13.380
Turn off
the Automatic Costume Change Device.

20:13.547 --> 20:15.382
Costume Device off.

20:20.595 --> 20:22.139
Quickly.

20:24.433 --> 20:28.729
Now, a small tricky charade
to preserve our secret identities.

20:28.937 --> 20:31.273
- Take your cues from me.
-Roger.

20:35.527 --> 20:36.778
Look, Dick.

20:36.987 --> 20:40.407
Good gravy, Dick,
coming through that window.

20:40.615 --> 20:43.785
Why, Bruce, isn't that Batman and Robin,
Bruce?

20:43.994 --> 20:45.746
It certainly is, Dick.

20:45.912 --> 20:47.748
Go on and get them, Batman and Robin.

20:47.956 --> 20:50.375
We'll just be out here
so as not to be in your way.

20:50.584 --> 20:52.377
Nice.

20:52.544 --> 20:54.796
Curse it!

20:57.048 --> 20:58.508
We have you this time, Penguin.

20:58.717 --> 21:02.512
We planted a tiny homing device in your hat.
We've been tracking you relentlessly.

21:02.721 --> 21:04.139
Up with your flippers.

21:04.347 --> 21:06.683
Surrender that gigantic pie.

21:06.892 --> 21:09.478
To the fray, my rascally restaurateurs!

21:47.224 --> 21:50.769
Stop, Batman!
Stop or I blow the lady's brains out!

21:50.977 --> 21:52.938
Batman-- Oh!

21:56.817 --> 21:59.319
Well hit, madam.

22:06.117 --> 22:09.871
Quickly, down and up the Batpoles
before they wake.

22:17.003 --> 22:19.923
- Ah.
-Good gravy.

22:20.131 --> 22:21.800
That must've been quite a battle.

22:22.008 --> 22:24.678
Yes, indeed, sir. Too bad you missed it.

22:24.886 --> 22:28.390
Where are they, Alfred?
I'd like to give them my thanks.

22:28.598 --> 22:31.017
They departed through the window, sir,
in some haste.

22:31.226 --> 22:34.771
Oh, and, sir,
they asked me to give you a message.

22:34.980 --> 22:38.733
Should you ever again come up
against such a criminal as the Penguin...

22:38.942 --> 22:42.320
...don't endeavor to capture him yourselves.
Call the police.

22:42.487 --> 22:45.699
- Quack.
-The job of crime-fighting is theirs.

22:45.907 --> 22:47.784
Faugh!

22:53.290 --> 22:55.500
There you are. Only one.

22:58.670 --> 23:03.717
Quack. Triumph at last.
We're being sent to the state pen.

23:03.925 --> 23:08.263
Rendezvous with Ballpoint Baxter
in the next cell.

23:08.471 --> 23:11.516
- You still got the handwriting samples, Pengy?
-Of course I do.

23:11.725 --> 23:14.102
In the handle of my tricky umbrella.

23:14.269 --> 23:16.396
Ha-ha-ha.
- Oh.

23:16.897 --> 23:19.608
- Good morning, commissioner.
- Oh, hello, Bruce.

23:19.816 --> 23:21.151
Has my man arrived?

23:21.359 --> 23:24.779
He should have been here by now.
O'Hara went to get him.

23:25.614 --> 23:28.283
Oh. Here he is now.

23:30.869 --> 23:31.912
Ballpoint.

23:32.704 --> 23:34.539
Ballpoint Baxter?

23:36.249 --> 23:39.586
That's right, Mr. Penguin.
I've just secured him a parole.

23:39.794 --> 23:42.088
Mr. Baxter's going to teach penmanship...

23:42.297 --> 23:46.134
...in one of the Wayne Foundation camps
for underprivileged children.

23:46.343 --> 23:48.345
Oh, no. No.

23:48.553 --> 23:51.514
What about the underprivileged criminal?

23:51.681 --> 23:54.351
All right, you crooked birds,
let's get moving.

23:54.517 --> 23:55.977
- Quack.
- Come on.

23:58.355 --> 24:01.566
Ballpoint. Ballpoint.
Ballpoint, don't leave me.

24:01.775 --> 24:05.695
All right, come on. The bus is ready
to take you to the state pen.

24:05.862 --> 24:09.532
Come on, Mr. Baxter, an honest life awaits.

24:09.741 --> 24:14.079
One I'm sure you'll find very, very satisfying.
