WEBVTT

00:01.468 --> 00:03.171
- I've been going at him
for six hours.

00:03.204 --> 00:05.106
He won't say a word.
The guy's a brick wall.

00:05.139 --> 00:07.141
- Not to worry, sarge.
- I'll take it from here.

00:07.175 --> 00:09.110
Hope you boys brought popcorn,

00:09.143 --> 00:11.245
'cause I'm about
to put on a show.

00:11.279 --> 00:12.313
Well, well, well.

00:12.346 --> 00:14.548
I hear you don't like
answering questions, Marcos.

00:14.582 --> 00:17.585
That's fine by me,
'cause I'm not asking.

00:17.618 --> 00:20.388
Ooh, handle fell off.
I'll just grab that.

00:22.623 --> 00:24.158
Nope.

00:24.192 --> 00:26.494
So looks like we're locked in.

00:26.527 --> 00:28.262
That's bad news for you,

00:28.296 --> 00:31.265
'cause you're trapped in here
with a psycho.

00:31.299 --> 00:32.833
Has anyone tried it
from the outside?

00:32.866 --> 00:34.378
- Lock's broken.
- Gotta call facilities.

00:34.402 --> 00:35.303
- Copy that.
- No rush.

00:35.336 --> 00:38.606
As I said, I got all
the time in the wor...

00:38.639 --> 00:40.274
It's a little warm in here,
right?

00:40.308 --> 00:41.518
Do you feel any air
coming out of that vent?

00:41.542 --> 00:43.411
I got nothing.
We got an ETA on facilities?

00:43.444 --> 00:44.578
- At least 45 minutes.

00:44.612 --> 00:46.556
- And they've checked all
this paint for lead, right?

00:46.580 --> 00:48.249
And the room for asbestos.

00:48.282 --> 00:50.418
I feel like I'm sucking
on a tailpipe in here, Marcos!

00:50.451 --> 00:54.122
Everybody get away
from the mirror!

00:54.155 --> 00:55.156
Come on!

00:55.189 --> 00:56.524
I can't breathe.
I can't breathe.

00:56.557 --> 00:58.159
- Hey, calm down, man.

00:58.192 --> 01:00.161
I'll confess.
Just stop freaking out.

01:00.194 --> 01:01.495
- What?
- I did it.

01:01.529 --> 01:03.297
- I robbed 'em.
- Boom!

01:03.331 --> 01:04.565
And that's how it's done.

01:04.598 --> 01:06.267
I was faking the whole thing
to break him.

01:06.300 --> 01:07.635
I coulda stayed in here forever.

01:07.668 --> 01:09.646
- Good, 'cause facilities
is gonna be a couple hours.

01:09.670 --> 01:11.839
- We're gonna die in here!

01:13.000 --> 01:19.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:31.892 --> 01:34.595
But in my version,
everything is a Transformer

01:34.628 --> 01:36.164
except cars.

01:36.197 --> 01:38.399
- Oh, right, like
some wisecracking biscotti

01:38.432 --> 01:40.334
that transforms
into a missile launcher.

01:40.368 --> 01:41.469
- No way.

01:41.502 --> 01:43.280
- Well, it might be hard
to do the CGI on the biscotti,

01:43.304 --> 01:44.272
but, yeah, I think
we could pull it off.

01:44.305 --> 01:46.174
- Huh? No, I wasn't listening
to either of you.

01:46.207 --> 01:48.242
Look who's in
Captain Holt's office.

01:48.276 --> 01:49.377
- Who that lady?

01:49.410 --> 01:51.488
- You are looking at the Second
Circuit Court of Appeals

01:51.512 --> 01:53.381
Judge Laverne Holt.

01:53.414 --> 01:54.482
- Captain Holt's mom.

01:54.515 --> 01:56.150
- The creator.

01:56.184 --> 01:58.352
- Widowed at age 39,
Laverne Kinnebrew Holt

01:58.386 --> 02:00.488
singlehandedly
raised two children

02:00.521 --> 02:02.423
and still managed to become
one of the first

02:02.456 --> 02:04.158
black, female federal judges.

02:04.192 --> 02:05.702
- Wow, someone read
her Wikipedia page.

02:05.726 --> 02:07.695
- No, Jake, I wrote it.

02:07.728 --> 02:09.229
- Oh.
- Ah! Shh.

02:09.263 --> 02:10.639
Okay, the door's opening.
We're gonna meet her.

02:10.663 --> 02:12.600
Everybody be cool.
Be cool!

02:12.633 --> 02:14.568
- Santiago, what are you up to?

02:14.602 --> 02:16.904
- Just jammin'.

02:16.937 --> 02:20.408
Jam on, jam on.

02:20.441 --> 02:21.609
- Okay, never mind.

02:21.642 --> 02:22.719
Peralta, come into
my office, please.

02:22.743 --> 02:24.278
- Ah.
- Sorry, baby, but...

02:24.312 --> 02:25.946
- Do you think it was
the "jam on" thing?

02:25.979 --> 02:29.517
- Yeah, I think it was
the "jam on" thing.

02:29.550 --> 02:31.252
- Detective Peralta,
this is my mother,

02:31.285 --> 02:33.254
the Honorable Laverne Holt.

02:33.287 --> 02:34.655
- I'm very excited to meet you.

02:34.688 --> 02:37.258
And let me just say, I'm a huge
fan of your early work.

02:37.291 --> 02:39.360
Talking about this guy
right here.

02:39.393 --> 02:40.594
- That was humor, mother.

02:40.628 --> 02:43.364
- I know,
and I thoroughly enjoyed it.

02:43.397 --> 02:45.233
- I love laughing and laughter.
- Oh.

02:45.266 --> 02:47.301
- Yes, we all do,
but enough chitchat.

02:47.335 --> 02:49.203
Peralta, my mother's house
was burgled.

02:49.237 --> 02:50.204
- And you want me
to cover the case

02:50.238 --> 02:52.706
because I'm your favorite
detective of all time.

02:52.740 --> 02:54.975
- Yes, also
the "jam on" incident.

02:55.008 --> 02:56.653
- Favorite. So why don't you
tell us what happened.

02:56.677 --> 02:57.578
- When I got home last night,

02:57.611 --> 02:59.680
I noticed that
the window had been smashed,

02:59.713 --> 03:02.416
the apartment was a mess,
they took all of my jewelry.

03:02.450 --> 03:04.618
I assume they entered
through the window,

03:04.652 --> 03:07.255
but I don't want
to color your opinions.

03:07.288 --> 03:08.365
- Too late, but note taken.

03:08.389 --> 03:10.558
We'll stop by later
and check out the crime scene.

03:10.591 --> 03:11.525
- That sounds appropriate.

03:11.559 --> 03:14.328
Well, I should be going.
Detective, Captain.

03:14.362 --> 03:16.297
- Your Honor, Detective.
- Captain, Your Honor.

03:16.330 --> 03:17.574
Hey, this is fun.
Let's do it again.

03:17.598 --> 03:18.566
Your Honor, Captain.

03:18.599 --> 03:20.568
- Humor.
- Good day, gentlemen.

03:20.601 --> 03:22.803
- Okay.

03:24.037 --> 03:25.706
This is amazing.

03:25.739 --> 03:28.342
Spending time with your mother
in your childhood home.

03:28.376 --> 03:30.678
Ah, the adorable baby pictures,
the embarrassing stories.

03:30.711 --> 03:32.446
The Founding Fathers Underoos.

03:32.480 --> 03:33.747
- There will be no Underoos.

03:33.781 --> 03:35.349
- You went commando?
- That's enough.

03:35.383 --> 03:36.784
- Okay.
- This is a case.

03:36.817 --> 03:38.586
I expect you to act
in a professional manner,

03:38.619 --> 03:39.687
not a personal one.

03:39.720 --> 03:41.422
I know sometimes
it's difficult for you

03:41.455 --> 03:42.456
to separate the two.

03:42.490 --> 03:43.800
- Ah, you're referring
to the fact that I love

03:43.824 --> 03:45.826
making everything
pro-fer-sonal.

03:45.859 --> 03:47.027
Copyright, me.

03:47.060 --> 03:48.629
Yeah, people love that
around here,

03:48.662 --> 03:50.364
especially Amy,
if you know what I mean.

03:50.398 --> 03:52.700
Wink.
Finger gun.

03:52.733 --> 03:54.335
- Perhaps Boyle
is still available.

03:54.368 --> 03:55.479
- No, no, no, I'll be good.
- I'll leave.

03:55.503 --> 03:57.571
- Oh, emergency, Hitchcock!

03:57.605 --> 03:59.407
- They're stealing Brown Betty.
- Freeze!

03:59.440 --> 04:01.709
- Get your hands off the couch.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

04:01.742 --> 04:04.312
Calm down.
We're getting a new one.

04:04.345 --> 04:06.423
We finally got some money
to spruce up the break room.

04:06.447 --> 04:08.349
- What? The break room's
perfect the way it is.

04:08.382 --> 04:10.351
It's so comfortable and relaxed.

04:10.384 --> 04:12.386
I can put my butt or feet
on any surface in there.

04:12.420 --> 04:14.822
- Exactly, it's disgusting,
which is why we're fixing it.

04:14.855 --> 04:17.591
I'm open to any and all
suggestions.

04:17.625 --> 04:19.360
- Two words.
- Property Brothers.

04:19.392 --> 04:21.829
And they would say,
"Two words, open concept."

04:21.862 --> 04:24.064
So four words,
Property Brothers, open concept.

04:24.097 --> 04:25.833
- Let's draw from
a wide variety of sources,

04:25.866 --> 04:28.302
anything from Cameron Diaz's
kitchen in "The Holiday,"

04:28.336 --> 04:29.679
to Kate Winslet's kitchen
in "The Holiday."

04:29.703 --> 04:31.372
- Is that such a huge range?

04:31.405 --> 04:32.882
- Why would Iris and Amanda
swap houses

04:32.906 --> 04:34.775
if they had
the same damn kitchen?

04:34.808 --> 04:36.677
- Okay, good point.

04:36.710 --> 04:38.612
Open concept,
Nancy Meyers-style kitchen.

04:38.646 --> 04:40.414
Two great ideas.
Let's keep 'em coming.

04:40.448 --> 04:42.526
- We could get one of those
spot-the-difference arcade games

04:42.550 --> 04:44.752
with pictures of naked ladies.

04:44.785 --> 04:46.554
- Tapped out at two.

04:46.587 --> 04:48.389
- Yikes, Amy.

04:48.422 --> 04:50.391
What's wrong with you?

04:50.424 --> 04:53.527
- I blew a huge opportunity
to work a case with Holt's mom.

04:53.561 --> 04:55.396
- Oh, yeah,
I didn't need an answer.

04:55.429 --> 04:57.097
"What's wrong"
is a rhetorical question.

04:57.130 --> 04:59.433
Anyway, I don't have time
for your sob story, okay?

04:59.467 --> 05:00.768
I blew a tire on the way here,

05:00.801 --> 05:02.536
so I have to call a tow truck.

05:02.570 --> 05:04.405
- A tow truck? What?

05:04.438 --> 05:05.615
You don't know
how to change a tire?

05:05.639 --> 05:07.408
I am so disappointed.

05:07.441 --> 05:09.443
That is a life skill
that every woman should have.

05:09.477 --> 05:11.579
- Condescending and untrue.

05:11.612 --> 05:13.547
Why would I do something myself

05:13.581 --> 05:15.683
if I could pay
someone else to do it?

05:15.716 --> 05:17.551
It's a gig economy, Amy.

05:17.585 --> 05:19.687
- Gina, it feels so empowering

05:19.720 --> 05:23.357
to use your own hands
to change a tire.

05:23.391 --> 05:24.558
- Phone, call me a tow truck.

05:24.592 --> 05:25.659
- No, phone, no!

05:25.693 --> 05:27.461
Look, Gina, don't call
a tow truck, okay?

05:27.495 --> 05:29.597
I will teach you
how to change a tire.

05:29.630 --> 05:31.465
You'll be so happy I did.

05:31.499 --> 05:34.435
- Okay, fine,
but on one condition.

05:34.468 --> 05:35.769
You buy me lunch.

05:35.803 --> 05:37.905
- What?
- No, I'm doing you a favor.

05:37.938 --> 05:39.048
- Phone...
- Okay, no, no, no, no.

05:39.072 --> 05:40.850
- Whatever you want, fine.
- Just let me teach you, please.

05:40.874 --> 05:41.909
I need a win today.

05:41.942 --> 05:44.945
- Okay, looks like
they broke through this window,

05:44.978 --> 05:46.947
rifled through the drawers,
and then noticed...

05:48.081 --> 05:50.818
this adorbs photo of tiny Holt
with a tiny bow tie

05:50.851 --> 05:52.420
holding a tiny toy.

05:52.453 --> 05:53.821
- That was his first slide rule.

05:53.854 --> 05:56.123
He carried it with him
all over preschool.

05:56.156 --> 05:58.392
- And then I learned to do
trigonometric functions

05:58.426 --> 06:00.160
in my head, like a big boy.

06:00.193 --> 06:01.862
Let's continue
with the investigation.

06:01.895 --> 06:03.497
- Copy that.
- The alarm company said

06:03.531 --> 06:05.132
the break-in happened
around 7:30.

06:05.165 --> 06:06.667
Most people are home
at that time.

06:06.700 --> 06:07.977
Is there anyone who knew
you'd be out?

06:08.001 --> 06:10.538
- The people who were
with me at wine club.

06:10.571 --> 06:12.840
Oh my, I just remembered,
Carol Spitzheim's house

06:12.873 --> 06:14.708
was broken into
several months ago,

06:14.742 --> 06:15.876
also during wine club.

06:15.909 --> 06:16.810
- Interesting.

06:16.844 --> 06:18.512
The odds of that happening
coincidentally

06:18.546 --> 06:19.613
are vanishingly small.

06:19.647 --> 06:20.948
- I would say infinitesimally.

06:20.981 --> 06:22.816
- Yes, and I would say
teenily-weenily.

06:22.850 --> 06:23.684
We all know words.

06:23.717 --> 06:25.753
So sounds like we should
go undercover

06:25.786 --> 06:27.626
to the next wine club meeting
and scope it out.

06:27.655 --> 06:28.622
You think you can get us in?

06:28.656 --> 06:29.733
- I think I can arrange that.

06:29.757 --> 06:30.758
There's one tonight.

06:30.791 --> 06:31.859
- Great.
- Final question.

06:31.892 --> 06:33.761
Is this little Raymond's
macaroni art?

06:33.794 --> 06:35.796
- No, that's
a macaroni infographic

06:35.829 --> 06:37.631
he made about
educational spending

06:37.665 --> 06:38.975
during the Johnson
administration.

06:38.999 --> 06:41.802
- Oh, of course it is.
- I love it.

06:41.835 --> 06:43.212
- Detective Peralta,
can I speak to you

06:43.236 --> 06:44.505
in my childhood bedroom?

06:44.538 --> 06:45.639
- Oh, my God, yes.

06:45.673 --> 06:47.875
Wait, this isn't your bedroom.

06:47.908 --> 06:49.510
- No, it's a regular room.

06:49.543 --> 06:50.978
- You tricked me.
- That's right.

06:51.011 --> 06:53.447
My childhood bedroom
is for good detectives

06:53.481 --> 06:54.791
who aren't embarrassing
themselves.

06:54.815 --> 06:55.925
- It is?
- I know you're having fun,

06:55.949 --> 06:57.994
but enough is enough with
the prying personal questions.

06:58.018 --> 06:59.553
You're annoying my mother.

06:59.587 --> 07:01.722
- Are you blind?
- We're vibing like crazy.

07:01.755 --> 07:03.591
- I assure you,
my mother's not a vibrator.

07:03.624 --> 07:04.592
- Definitely not
what that's short for.

07:04.625 --> 07:07.495
- I know her very well,
and she would never, uh,

07:07.528 --> 07:10.230
connect with someone
such as yourself, no offense.

07:10.263 --> 07:11.131
- Rude.
- I'm sorry.

07:11.164 --> 07:13.767
What I mean is she and I
are very similar.

07:13.801 --> 07:15.569
- Hurtful.
- All I'm saying is

07:15.603 --> 07:17.471
she's not interested
in skateboards

07:17.505 --> 07:18.639
and soft-water drinks.

07:18.672 --> 07:19.573
- I happen to think
you're wrong.

07:19.607 --> 07:21.208
I think she and I
make a wonderful pair,

07:21.241 --> 07:22.610
and we're already
becoming friends.

07:22.643 --> 07:23.877
- Now that is humor.

07:23.911 --> 07:25.713
- Is everything all right?

07:25.746 --> 07:27.848
- Yes, we're all done in here,
Your Honor.

07:27.881 --> 07:28.849
- "Your Honor"?

07:28.882 --> 07:30.250
Don't be so formal.

07:30.283 --> 07:31.552
Call me Laverne.

07:31.585 --> 07:33.521
- Oh.
- Okay, Laverne.

07:33.554 --> 07:35.255
You got it, Laverne.

07:35.288 --> 07:36.857
Laverne.

07:39.192 --> 07:40.093
- Well, I know we're
undercover, but I gotta say

07:40.127 --> 07:42.229
I'm dying to get
a little tipsy at wine club

07:42.262 --> 07:44.998
and just dish
with my new BFF Laverne.

07:45.032 --> 07:46.700
- Hmm, it's cute you think that.

07:46.734 --> 07:47.835
My mother doesn't dish.

07:47.868 --> 07:48.978
It's one of her
better qualities.

07:49.002 --> 07:51.839
And you know who else
she told to call her Laverne?

07:51.872 --> 07:54.708
The mailman.
The substitute mailman.

07:54.742 --> 07:55.909
- Hello.
- I'm Judge Holt.

07:55.943 --> 07:57.144
- It's nice to meet you.

07:57.177 --> 07:58.979
I'm Tyrone Beverton,

07:59.012 --> 08:00.781
a Bordeaux enthusiast
who sometimes dabbles

08:00.814 --> 08:02.516
in the Burgundies, if forced.

08:02.550 --> 08:05.152
- And I'm Tank Hendricks.
- Moms love me.

08:05.185 --> 08:08.188
- Oh, strange detail.
- But believable.

08:08.221 --> 08:12.526
Oh, Daniella, these are
two prospective members,

08:12.560 --> 08:13.794
Tyrone and Tank.

08:13.827 --> 08:15.262
Tyrone likes Bordeauxs,

08:15.295 --> 08:17.765
- and Tank is beloved by mothers.
- Yes.

08:17.798 --> 08:20.000
- Great. Could I get your info
for our database?

08:20.033 --> 08:23.036
- Absolutely.
- I live at 100 Charming Avenue.

08:23.070 --> 08:25.906
And Tyrone here
is at 3282nd Street,

08:25.939 --> 08:28.008
right next to Ya Burnt Pizza.

08:28.041 --> 08:29.810
- Great.
- Enjoy your tasting.

08:29.843 --> 08:31.745
- Thanks.

08:31.779 --> 08:34.114
- 100 Charming Avenue?
- It's a real place.

08:34.147 --> 08:36.116
I looked it up,
specifically to make you mad.

08:36.149 --> 08:38.085
Okay, I'm gonna go find
and catch our perp.

08:38.118 --> 08:39.787
Love you, bye.

08:40.821 --> 08:43.890
- And that is that.

08:43.924 --> 08:45.893
- We have Shui'd the Feng
out of this place.

08:45.926 --> 08:46.894
- It's beautiful.

08:46.927 --> 08:48.796
Are we better at this
than our regular jobs?

08:48.829 --> 08:49.997
- Unquestionably.

08:50.030 --> 08:51.899
We should start our own
home renovation show.

08:51.932 --> 08:52.966
- I can see the poster.

08:53.000 --> 08:54.911
I'm on Terry's shoulders
screwing in a light bulb,

08:54.935 --> 08:57.037
and Rosa stands by a ladder
looking up at us like,

08:57.070 --> 08:59.139
"Oh, boy, what did I
get myself into?"

08:59.172 --> 09:01.609
- I love that idea.
- Sign me up.

09:02.810 --> 09:04.812
- Shame.
- Shame, shame.

09:04.845 --> 09:06.279
- What is happening?

09:06.313 --> 09:08.882
- You guys messed up.
- You messed up big time!

09:08.916 --> 09:10.059
- And worst of all,
you're standing here

09:10.083 --> 09:11.251
applauding yourselves for it.

09:11.284 --> 09:12.986
- Shame.
- Are you blind?

09:13.020 --> 09:14.888
This place looks amazing.

09:14.922 --> 09:16.099
It looks like a Swedish airport.

09:16.123 --> 09:17.290
Everyone's gonna love it.

09:17.324 --> 09:18.892
- Just keep telling
yourselves that.

09:18.926 --> 09:20.961
- Shame.
- Shame.

09:20.994 --> 09:23.296
- Well, everyone
I talked to checked out.

09:23.330 --> 09:24.598
- Any luck on your end?
- None.

09:24.632 --> 09:27.200
Unfortunately we're surrounded
by stupid law-abiding citizens.

09:27.234 --> 09:28.602
- Check out this guy at the bar.

09:28.636 --> 09:30.203
He's furtively looking
at my mother.

09:30.237 --> 09:33.140
- Well, let's see
what he has to say for himself.

09:33.173 --> 09:35.375
Hi, there.
I'm Tank, this is Tyrone.

09:35.408 --> 09:37.277
He's the son
of a close friend of mine.

09:37.310 --> 09:39.079
- Anyway, we're new members.

09:39.112 --> 09:40.881
- George Kenderson.

09:40.914 --> 09:42.883
I'm fairly new
to the club as well.

09:42.916 --> 09:44.952
- How'd you hear about it?

09:44.985 --> 09:46.920
- I, um...

09:46.954 --> 09:47.988
I didn't.

09:48.021 --> 09:49.156
- You didn't hear about it?

09:49.189 --> 09:50.824
That seems rather odd.

09:50.858 --> 09:53.160
- Does it?
- Mm-hmm.

09:53.193 --> 09:55.262
- I'm sorry, I gotta leave now.

09:55.295 --> 09:58.065
I've got some work to do.
Good-bye.

09:58.098 --> 09:59.166
- When it comes to George,

09:59.199 --> 10:02.402
I'm getting hints of guilty
with undertones of lying.

10:02.435 --> 10:06.039
- Oh, yeah, and a strong bouquet
of "up to no good."

10:06.073 --> 10:09.342
Wine terms.

10:09.376 --> 10:11.945
- And then you release the jack.

10:11.979 --> 10:13.380
And voila.

10:13.413 --> 10:15.282
Tire changed.

10:15.315 --> 10:17.017
Don't you feel empowered?

10:17.050 --> 10:19.019
- Yes, there's nothing
more empowering

10:19.052 --> 10:20.888
than getting
a condescending colleague

10:20.921 --> 10:22.389
to do a menial task for you.

10:22.422 --> 10:23.390
- What are you talking about?

10:23.423 --> 10:25.134
- I'm talking about
how you just changed my tire

10:25.158 --> 10:27.094
while I sat here watching
a 20-minute video

10:27.127 --> 10:28.962
of a monkey
getting its hair combed.

10:28.996 --> 10:30.898
- But you were paying attention.

10:30.931 --> 10:32.666
- You laughed at my joke.
- Did I?

10:32.700 --> 10:35.703
- I like to call this
the jack of all trades.

10:35.736 --> 10:37.304
- Silly monkey!

10:37.337 --> 10:39.139
Oh, this monkey.

10:39.172 --> 10:40.416
- So you really didn't
learn anything?

10:40.440 --> 10:42.275
- No, but I hope you did.

10:42.309 --> 10:43.376
Can't school Gina.

10:43.410 --> 10:46.079
Gina schools you.
Class dismissed.

10:48.181 --> 10:49.316
- Hello, Laverne.

10:49.349 --> 10:51.051
We're not undercover anymore,

10:51.084 --> 10:52.428
so I'm no longer
your acquaintance Tank.

10:52.452 --> 10:54.363
I'm back to being your
close personal friend Jake.

10:54.387 --> 10:56.023
- Okay.
- We have a lead.

10:56.056 --> 10:57.257
George Kenderson.

10:57.290 --> 10:59.026
We ran his name
through the system.

10:59.059 --> 11:01.237
He got a parking ticket outside
your apartment last week.

11:01.261 --> 11:03.063
We think he was
casing your place.

11:03.096 --> 11:04.932
- Oh, my.
- That is shocking.

11:04.965 --> 11:06.266
I am shocked right now.

11:06.299 --> 11:07.367
- And I am enraged.

11:07.400 --> 11:09.436
We are shocked and enraged.

11:09.469 --> 11:11.171
- Yes, and we're all showing it.

11:11.204 --> 11:12.716
- I'll get the car.
- Stay with my mother.

11:12.740 --> 11:14.942
I've never seen her
this shocked before.

11:16.977 --> 11:20.047
- Jake, I need to tell you
something in confidence.

11:20.080 --> 11:22.315
- It's happening.
- It's dish time. Okay.

11:22.349 --> 11:24.284
- George Kenderson
did not rob me.

11:24.317 --> 11:26.219
He was not casing my apartment.

11:26.253 --> 11:28.488
- How do you know?
- He was with me that night.

11:28.521 --> 11:31.024
- Doing what?
- Oh, doing you.

11:31.058 --> 11:32.192
Oh, God, I'm so sorry.

11:32.225 --> 11:34.294
I mean, way to go.
I'm sex positive.

11:34.327 --> 11:35.428
I don't know what to say.

11:35.462 --> 11:38.231
- George and I have been
in a relationship for two years.

11:38.265 --> 11:41.068
Raymond doesn't know.
Please don't tell him.

11:41.101 --> 11:43.470
I'm asking you as a friend.

11:43.503 --> 11:46.306
- As a friend.

11:46.339 --> 11:47.975
Copy that.

11:48.008 --> 11:49.376
- Buckle up.

11:49.409 --> 11:51.444
That car belongs
to our lead suspect,

11:51.478 --> 11:52.512
George Kenderson.

11:52.545 --> 11:53.781
- Lead suspect?

11:53.814 --> 11:55.482
Is that how we left it?

11:55.515 --> 11:57.417
I remember saying,
it can't be Kenderson.

11:57.450 --> 11:59.252
Remember, we made up
that little song.

12:03.556 --> 12:06.226
- Oh, Kenderson is on the move.
- Oh, great.

12:06.259 --> 12:07.436
- There's something so devious

12:07.460 --> 12:09.229
about taking advantage
of wine lovers.

12:09.262 --> 12:11.765
But there won't be any wine
where you're headed, George.

12:11.799 --> 12:14.134
Unless you make it in a toilet.

12:14.167 --> 12:16.436
Toilet wine.
Let's bring him in, Peralta.

12:17.470 --> 12:19.106
- Well, wait. Not yet.
- Why?

12:19.139 --> 12:20.507
- 'Cause I, uh...

12:21.574 --> 12:22.843
- Mm.
- What are you doing?

12:22.876 --> 12:26.246
Forensics says his prints were
all over my mothers' apartment.

12:26.279 --> 12:27.279
- Eh.

12:31.051 --> 12:32.385
Nope, nope, nope.

12:32.419 --> 12:34.354
- Enough!
- He robbed my mother.

12:34.387 --> 12:36.356
- No, he didn't.

12:36.389 --> 12:37.991
He's her lover.

12:38.025 --> 12:40.060
He's your mother lover.
He's lovering your mother.

12:40.093 --> 12:42.029
- What?
- That's not true.

12:42.062 --> 12:43.230
- Yes, it is.

12:43.263 --> 12:45.132
- I would know if she
were seeing someone.

12:45.165 --> 12:46.466
- She told me last night.

12:46.499 --> 12:48.836
They've been together
for two years.

12:48.869 --> 12:49.870
- I see.

12:49.903 --> 12:53.240
- And she asked me
not to say anything to you.

12:54.507 --> 12:56.343
- I see.

12:56.376 --> 12:59.446
- So are you upset
or just processing

12:59.479 --> 13:01.414
or just stopping
in the middle of nowhere

13:01.448 --> 13:03.448
and getting out of the car?
Cool, cool, cool, cool.

13:04.284 --> 13:06.453
Stop honking!
He's going through something!

13:09.089 --> 13:11.391
- Hello, sir.
- How was your walk?

13:11.424 --> 13:13.093
- Long and brisk.
- Wonderful.

13:13.126 --> 13:14.838
You left me in the car,
took the keys with you.

13:14.862 --> 13:16.005
It's still there.
Doesn't matter.

13:16.029 --> 13:17.106
Look, I know it
must have been upsetting

13:17.130 --> 13:20.267
to find out about
your mom's, mm,

13:20.300 --> 13:21.902
how you say... sex.

13:21.935 --> 13:23.303
No.
Boinking.

13:23.336 --> 13:24.404
No.
Doinking.

13:24.437 --> 13:25.614
Ah, it's too similar
to boinking.

13:25.638 --> 13:27.274
I'm looking for the words.

13:27.307 --> 13:31.411
Smashing of... stuffs together.

13:31.444 --> 13:34.047
Eh, let's just go with
she has a boyfriend now.

13:34.081 --> 13:36.850
- Yes, I was caught off guard,
but I'm fine now.

13:36.884 --> 13:37.951
- Really?
- Yes.

13:37.985 --> 13:39.386
And don't worry, I understand.

13:39.419 --> 13:41.421
She didn't want me to know,
and I will behave

13:41.454 --> 13:43.556
in a completely
professional manner.

13:43.590 --> 13:46.559
- Great.
- 'Cause she's in your office.

13:46.593 --> 13:48.071
- Oh, wonderful.
- Let's go talk about the case.

13:48.095 --> 13:50.430
- Wow, you are
taking this so well.

13:50.463 --> 13:51.498
- Laverne Kinnebrew Holt,

13:51.531 --> 13:53.433
you're under arrest
for obstruction of justice.

13:53.466 --> 13:54.234
What?

13:54.267 --> 13:56.436
- I know you're sleeping
with George.

13:56.469 --> 13:57.304
- Oh, come on, man.

13:57.337 --> 13:59.439
- Raymond, I can tell
that you're upset.

13:59.472 --> 14:01.875
- I am because you withheld
information from this detective

14:01.909 --> 14:03.977
about an ongoing
police investigation.

14:04.011 --> 14:06.646
- All right, I don't think this
is actually about police stuff.

14:06.679 --> 14:08.548
Maybe we should all
just take a deep breath

14:08.581 --> 14:11.084
and consider
not arresting our moms.

14:11.118 --> 14:13.486
- Fine.
- You're unarrested, mother.

14:13.520 --> 14:14.654
And Detective Peralta,

14:14.687 --> 14:16.589
since you two
are such good friends,

14:16.623 --> 14:18.992
why don't you handle
the case on your own?

14:19.026 --> 14:20.961
Good day.

14:20.994 --> 14:22.129
- Captain.

14:22.162 --> 14:24.464
- Hey.
- What is going on in the kitchen?

14:24.497 --> 14:25.899
It's insanely packed.

14:25.933 --> 14:27.367
- They're all
just taking a break.

14:27.400 --> 14:29.602
Why is nobody breaking
in the new break room?

14:29.636 --> 14:31.671
- 'Cause it's a giant turd.
- It's the worst.

14:31.704 --> 14:34.341
It's unusable.
You guys don't even like it.

14:34.374 --> 14:35.909
- Yes, we do.
- Really?

14:35.943 --> 14:38.378
You like those new stools,
huh, Charles?

14:38.411 --> 14:40.047
- Oh.

14:40.080 --> 14:41.114
Oh.

14:41.148 --> 14:42.349
There we go.

14:42.382 --> 14:43.984
- And, Rosa, how was your snack?

14:48.021 --> 14:49.498
- You know what really
chafes my crack?

14:49.522 --> 14:51.034
We spent years
crafting that break room

14:51.058 --> 14:53.460
into something special,
something comfortable.

14:53.493 --> 14:55.028
- A place with so many stains

14:55.062 --> 14:56.663
that the new ones
just blended in.

14:56.696 --> 14:59.099
- Where the couch cushions
were so worn down,

14:59.132 --> 15:02.035
they comforted all butts,
large or small,

15:02.069 --> 15:03.536
flat or juicy.

15:03.570 --> 15:04.637
- Juicy?
- Gross.

15:04.671 --> 15:05.572
- We built a masterpiece,

15:05.605 --> 15:07.574
and you amateurs
flushed it down the toilet.

15:07.607 --> 15:08.575
Skir-plash.

15:08.608 --> 15:10.377
- Was that supposed to be
a flushing sound?

15:10.410 --> 15:12.079
- Skir-plash.

15:15.415 --> 15:17.584
- Hello, Gina.
- Ugh!

15:17.617 --> 15:20.153
I knew a truck carrying
Khloe Kardashian jeans

15:20.187 --> 15:22.522
didn't overturn
in the parking garage.

15:22.555 --> 15:24.191
- The only thin
that's overturned

15:24.224 --> 15:27.527
is your decision to not
learn how to fix a tire.

15:27.560 --> 15:29.429
- Why won't you let this go?

15:29.462 --> 15:31.440
- My parents wanted me to learn
how to change a tire,

15:31.464 --> 15:33.133
and I thought
it was a waste of time.

15:33.166 --> 15:35.002
Like any other
16-year-old girl,

15:35.035 --> 15:37.137
all I wanted to do
was sit in my room alone

15:37.170 --> 15:39.072
reading books on U.S. history.

15:39.106 --> 15:42.509
- Ugh, every story about
your childhood makes me so sad.

15:42.542 --> 15:44.444
- Then one day
on the way to math camp...

15:44.477 --> 15:46.179
- Oh, sad.
- Our tire blew out,

15:46.213 --> 15:48.048
and my mother made me fix it.

15:48.081 --> 15:49.682
She said I should
never be dependent

15:49.716 --> 15:51.551
on anyone for anything.

15:51.584 --> 15:53.453
And neither should you.

15:53.486 --> 15:54.687
So we're not gonna leave here

15:54.721 --> 15:56.990
until you learn how to fix this.

15:57.024 --> 15:58.058
- Oh!

15:58.091 --> 15:59.092
Oh, damn.

15:59.126 --> 16:00.460
Power play.

16:00.493 --> 16:02.062
And very moving speech.

16:02.095 --> 16:03.696
- Thank you.
- One little thing though.

16:03.730 --> 16:05.065
That's not my car.

16:05.098 --> 16:08.101
That's my car.
Same make, same model,

16:08.135 --> 16:10.270
but you just slashed
a random stranger's tire.

16:10.303 --> 16:12.572
Oopsie!

16:12.605 --> 16:14.107
- Oh, God, oh, God,
oh, God, oh, God.

16:14.141 --> 16:16.109
- Ah, hey, Captain.

16:16.143 --> 16:17.677
Whoa, look at that map work.

16:17.710 --> 16:19.179
Sick as heck.

16:19.212 --> 16:21.781
- Oh an attempt at flattery.
- Well, it won't work.

16:21.814 --> 16:24.051
This was Boyle's map,
and it was adequate at best.

16:24.084 --> 16:26.186
- Okay, I called some precincts,

16:26.219 --> 16:28.031
and it turns out that
while we were at wine club,

16:28.055 --> 16:29.589
there was
an attempted break-in

16:29.622 --> 16:31.758
at 100 Charming Avenue.

16:31.791 --> 16:33.726
- Oh, yes, the address
you used at the wine club

16:33.760 --> 16:35.128
specifically to make me mad.

16:35.162 --> 16:36.063
- Well, I wouldn't
put it that way.

16:36.096 --> 16:38.065
- You put it that way
last night, verbatim.

16:38.098 --> 16:40.043
- And I totally regret that now,
and I hope that we can move on,

16:40.067 --> 16:41.601
but the point is the only person

16:41.634 --> 16:43.736
who heard me use
that address was...

16:43.770 --> 16:45.638
Daniella Andrade.

16:45.672 --> 16:47.307
The mailing list lady
from the wine club.

16:47.340 --> 16:49.185
She would give the addresses
to her husband, Tommy...

16:49.209 --> 16:51.278
Hi, Tommy... and he would
break into the houses

16:51.311 --> 16:54.147
while the occupants
were out sipping vino.

16:54.181 --> 16:56.216
- Okay, case closed.

16:56.249 --> 16:57.693
- Great. So you want
to call your mother?

16:57.717 --> 16:59.152
- Tell her we solved it?
- No need.

16:59.186 --> 17:02.189
You can tell Laverne
the whole story over brunch.

17:06.358 --> 17:07.603
- All right, sir, I'm sorry
that I got in the middle

17:07.627 --> 17:09.229
of your family business,
but I'm afraid

17:09.262 --> 17:11.231
I have to get
in the middle of it again.

17:11.263 --> 17:13.066
Look, I don't talk
about this a lot,

17:13.099 --> 17:14.443
but I actually have had
a difficult relationship

17:14.467 --> 17:15.535
with one of my parents.

17:15.568 --> 17:17.445
- Yes, your father.
- You talk about it obsessively.

17:17.470 --> 17:19.239
- Well, I wouldn't say
obsessively.

17:19.271 --> 17:20.415
I mean, sure, there are times

17:20.440 --> 17:21.617
where I wish he was
there for me more but...

17:21.641 --> 17:23.175
- Peralta.
- Right. Sorry, you.

17:23.210 --> 17:24.819
Look, in my experience
the best thing to do

17:24.844 --> 17:26.846
in these types of situations
is just talk about it.

17:26.878 --> 17:29.549
- That's not the relationship
my mother and I have.

17:29.582 --> 17:31.351
We're not open like that.

17:31.384 --> 17:32.352
- Really?
- Because you're open with me.

17:32.385 --> 17:35.155
- Only because you ask me
annoying, intrusive,

17:35.188 --> 17:36.465
personal questions all the time.

17:36.489 --> 17:38.291
- Exactly.
- You need to do that.

17:38.325 --> 17:39.568
Be the Jake in the conversation.

17:39.592 --> 17:41.528
- You want me to just say,
"Cowabunga, mom"?

17:41.561 --> 17:43.263
- Oh, yes,
that would be awesome.

17:43.296 --> 17:44.407
- Well, it's not gonna happen.

17:44.431 --> 17:47.600
Alas, we are not
cowabunga people.

17:47.634 --> 17:49.869
Dismissed.

17:49.902 --> 17:52.872
- Once again,
I am so sorry about your tire.

17:52.905 --> 17:56.343
Just accidentally
slashed it with my knife.

17:56.376 --> 17:58.311
- How does that happen
accidentally?

17:58.345 --> 18:00.280
- It's very common.
- I should know, I'm a cop.

18:00.313 --> 18:02.282
Anyway, I will pay
for the damage.

18:02.315 --> 18:04.451
- Wait, what's happening?
- My tire is fine.

18:04.484 --> 18:07.120
- It is?
- It is!

18:07.154 --> 18:08.621
Of course it is.

18:08.655 --> 18:11.558
Because this is all
part of my prank show,

18:11.591 --> 18:13.560
"Fake Tire Slashers."

18:13.593 --> 18:14.627
Whoo!

18:14.661 --> 18:16.263
And you have won...

18:16.296 --> 18:18.898
$27.

18:18.931 --> 18:21.268
And a dime.

18:21.301 --> 18:23.403
There's cameras everywhere.

18:23.436 --> 18:25.605
- Okay.

18:25.638 --> 18:27.407
- Thank you.

18:27.440 --> 18:29.309
- Wondering what happened?

18:29.342 --> 18:30.377
I happened.

18:30.410 --> 18:33.346
Out of the darkness,
a hero emerges.

18:33.380 --> 18:35.615
You know,
using only my bare hands

18:35.648 --> 18:37.617
and also a few tools

18:37.650 --> 18:41.621
I replaced that plebe's flat
with one of my tires.

18:41.654 --> 18:43.156
- You changed a tire!

18:43.190 --> 18:45.325
- You were listening to me.
- Not at all.

18:45.358 --> 18:47.327
I watched a video online
on how to do it.

18:47.360 --> 18:50.630
But I will give you this,
it was really empowering.

18:50.663 --> 18:53.200
- Right? And you did
such an impressive job,

18:53.233 --> 18:54.701
especially for your first time.

18:54.734 --> 18:56.569
- Oh, no, I had
a bunch of practice.

18:56.603 --> 18:58.505
I actually used
your car for that.

18:58.538 --> 19:00.207
Thank you so much.

19:00.240 --> 19:01.908
- Oh.

19:01.941 --> 19:04.244
You still changed a tire.

19:04.277 --> 19:06.446
Counting this as a win.

19:06.479 --> 19:09.716
- Okay, you're right
about the break room.

19:09.749 --> 19:11.251
- Nuh doy.

19:11.284 --> 19:12.961
- Nobody liked it,
and it wasn't functional.

19:12.985 --> 19:14.053
- Double nuh doy.

19:14.086 --> 19:15.931
- So we tried to put
everything back the way it was.

19:15.955 --> 19:18.491
We want your seal of approval.

19:18.525 --> 19:19.926
- Oh, we'll be
the judge of that.

19:19.959 --> 19:22.462
- Yes, that's what
we're asking for.

19:22.495 --> 19:24.531
- It's beautiful.

19:24.564 --> 19:27.967
You even got back the bumper
pool table no one ever uses.

19:28.000 --> 19:29.669
- Wait a minute, you liars!

19:29.702 --> 19:31.538
What's that nice couch
doing here?

19:31.571 --> 19:32.681
- The old couch didn't make it.

19:32.705 --> 19:34.650
- The second the sunlight
hit it, it turned to dust.

19:34.674 --> 19:37.510
- Sorry, guys, we're stuck with
the nice, clean expensive sofa.

19:37.544 --> 19:39.412
But I guess we'll just
have to make do.

19:39.446 --> 19:41.548
- Oh, we'll make do.
- We'll make do all over it.

19:42.715 --> 19:43.792
- Well, I just mean
we'll fix it.

19:43.816 --> 19:46.253
- Hells yeah, we will.

19:55.462 --> 19:57.264
- Should we wake them?

19:57.297 --> 19:59.966
- Nah, let 'em sleep.
- They earned it.

19:59.999 --> 20:02.535
- Daniella and her husband
confessed to the burglary

20:02.569 --> 20:03.603
and two others.

20:03.636 --> 20:05.538
We've already recovered
a number of your items.

20:05.572 --> 20:07.707
- Thank you for the information.

20:07.740 --> 20:09.276
Where's Raymond?

20:09.309 --> 20:10.810
- Oh, he couldn't make it.

20:10.843 --> 20:13.513
He's attending
to some urgent business.

20:13.546 --> 20:15.615
- That's a stone cold lie.
- Raymond?

20:15.648 --> 20:17.317
- Cowabunga, mother!

20:17.350 --> 20:18.585
- What?
- Yes.

20:18.618 --> 20:20.653
- We need to talk.
- I'd say that's accurate.

20:20.687 --> 20:23.723
- Well, it looks like
my work is done here.

20:23.756 --> 20:26.459
I'll just be leaving.
Oh, damn it.

20:26.493 --> 20:28.027
Handle's still broken off.

20:28.060 --> 20:29.996
Uh, just pretend I'm not here.

20:30.029 --> 20:31.631
I'll close my eyes.

20:31.664 --> 20:35.335
- I'm hurt that you didn't
feel comfortable

20:35.368 --> 20:36.803
telling me
about George Kenderson.

20:36.836 --> 20:38.738
- I didn't know how to.

20:38.771 --> 20:41.674
We're not very good at talking
about personal matters.

20:41.708 --> 20:43.810
- I'd categorize that
as an understatement.

20:43.843 --> 20:44.711
- Humor?

20:44.744 --> 20:46.346
- Yes, to alleviate
some of the tension.

20:46.379 --> 20:47.647
- It worked.

20:47.680 --> 20:48.748
After your father died,

20:48.781 --> 20:51.050
my personal life was very sad.

20:51.083 --> 20:52.752
I didn't talk to you about it,

20:52.785 --> 20:55.588
because I wanted you
to think I was strong.

20:55.622 --> 20:58.491
- And I wanted you
to think the same of me.

20:58.525 --> 21:00.527
I guess eventually
we stopped talking

21:00.560 --> 21:03.296
about personal matter
altogether.

21:03.330 --> 21:05.432
- I think it's time we let
each other off the hook.

21:05.465 --> 21:08.635
From now on, I'm going
to be 15% more forthcoming

21:08.668 --> 21:10.036
on personal details

21:10.069 --> 21:13.039
and 5% more
physically affectionate.

21:13.072 --> 21:14.474
- And I will adjust in kind,

21:14.507 --> 21:16.643
while also implementing
a 12% increase

21:16.676 --> 21:18.578
in impromptu communication.

21:18.611 --> 21:20.613
- Oh, Raymond.

21:20.647 --> 21:22.382
I love you.

21:22.415 --> 21:23.583
- I love you, too.

21:23.616 --> 21:25.352
- Oh, this is such
a beautiful moment.

21:25.385 --> 21:27.587
Are you guys hugging?
It feels like a hugging moment.

21:27.620 --> 21:28.831
- In the workplace?
- Don't be absurd.

21:28.855 --> 21:30.757
- Stop yelling at me.
- I saved the day!

21:30.790 --> 21:32.825
- Not a doctor.
- Shh.
