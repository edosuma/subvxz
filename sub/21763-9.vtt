02:31.609 --> 02:32.443
Or how about...

02:32.527 --> 02:34.195
[giggling] Eh...

02:34.279 --> 02:35.864
Wait, it's... five, six, seven.

-[howling over stereo]

Oh, there's the beat.
There it... Nope, false alarm.

-That's not it.
-Hmm.

Take your pineapple friend.

-Hmm.

-Yes, he is.

-Aah! [grunting]
-Uh...

03:37.508 --> 03:40.678
Clover, stop! You know what?
Yeah, go ahead, do your thing.

03:40.762 --> 03:42.555
That was an awful, terrible song.

03:42.639 --> 03:43.765
Get behind me, Your Majesty.

03:43.848 --> 03:44.682
Wait, why?

03:44.766 --> 03:46.643
-Has anyone seen Pancho?
-[Maurice] Huh? [exclaims]

03:46.726 --> 03:48.019
Yeah, he's...

03:48.394 --> 03:51.022
Huh? Well, he was twitching right here
a second ago.

03:51.522 --> 03:53.358
We need to get King Julien
into the safe room.

03:53.441 --> 03:54.317
-Immediately.
-Aah!

03:55.026 --> 03:56.110
[toilet flushing]

03:56.194 --> 03:59.113
[Julien] Eh! This is the safe room?

03:59.614 --> 04:02.242
Well, yeah. It is the safest room.

04:02.325 --> 04:05.245
Besides, we don't have the budget
for a real safe room. So...

04:05.328 --> 04:08.665
-[knocking at door]
-Yoo-hoo, is this  ocupado?

04:08.748 --> 04:10.291
-[Clover] Go away, Ted!
-Oh!

04:10.750 --> 04:12.085
Oh, boy.

04:12.168 --> 04:16.089
Uh. Clover, would you mind telling me
what's going on?

04:16.172 --> 04:17.173
Like, right now?

04:17.257 --> 04:19.384
Seriously, Clover. What's this all about?

04:19.467 --> 04:22.345
It has to do with the Footstool Program.

04:22.428 --> 04:24.013
-The what program?
-Never heard of it.

04:24.097 --> 04:25.265
Exactly.

04:27.642 --> 04:28.476
Ah...

04:29.811 --> 04:32.897
Uh, Clo-Clo, this folder is empty.

04:33.606 --> 04:34.899
Exactly.

04:34.983 --> 04:35.817
Clover!

04:35.900 --> 04:37.360
Sorry. [clears throat]

04:37.443 --> 04:40.571
The Footstool Program
was a top secret security program

04:40.655 --> 04:43.241
put into place by Uncle King Julien
when he was king.

04:43.324 --> 04:44.367
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

04:44.450 --> 04:46.494
If this is so top secret,

04:46.577 --> 04:48.913
how do you know about it and I don't?

04:48.997 --> 04:51.749
Maurice. Does Clover have
higher security clearance than I do?

04:51.833 --> 04:52.834
[shouts] How should I know?

04:52.917 --> 04:53.751
No!

04:53.835 --> 04:57.088
I was Uncle King Julien's
head of security, remember?

04:57.171 --> 05:01.134
I was privy to all the highly classified
security information during his reign.

05:01.217 --> 05:02.635
-[knocking on door]
-[Ted] Me again. [laughs]

05:02.719 --> 05:06.389
Hi, I'm really sorry to bother you,
but I really have to go.

05:06.472 --> 05:08.182
-[Julien] Ah! Clench your tail muscles.
-[groans]

05:08.266 --> 05:09.267
We'll be done in a minute.

05:09.350 --> 05:10.727
Please continue, Clover.

05:10.810 --> 05:11.728
I'll show you.

05:12.895 --> 05:15.523
[both whimpering]

05:15.606 --> 05:18.609
Toilet corn. Always makes a movie
more enjoyable.

05:18.693 --> 05:19.777
-[Maurice exclaims]
-[Julien munching]

05:19.902 --> 05:21.863
-Mmm-- Hmm.
-[groans]

05:22.697 --> 05:24.157
First, Uncle King Julien

05:24.240 --> 05:25.658
wiped the agents' memories.

05:26.284 --> 05:27.327
-[buzzes]
-[all screaming]

05:27.577 --> 05:29.787
-[beeps]
-Then, he brainwashed them,

05:29.871 --> 05:31.039
training them to target

05:31.122 --> 05:33.750
all of Uncle Julien's enemies
when activated.

05:34.292 --> 05:38.671
Then he used the mixtape you played
to activate the agents,

05:38.755 --> 05:41.132
setting loose an unstoppable deadly force,

05:41.215 --> 05:44.302
[shouts] the likes of which
have never been seen before!

05:44.385 --> 05:46.137
-But the training didn't stop there.
-[projector whirring]

05:46.220 --> 05:50.391
In an attempt to help the agents blend in
and go unnoticed in the kingdom,

05:50.475 --> 05:53.728
he made them take advanced improv classes.

05:53.895 --> 05:58.316
Let's begin the next exercise.
Can someone name a profession?

05:58.399 --> 06:00.109
-Fart mechanic.  [chuckles]
-A fart...

06:00.777 --> 06:04.113
Fine. You're a fart mechanic.
Now we need a location.

06:04.197 --> 06:05.573
Your mom.

06:05.656 --> 06:07.575
-That's not a location.
-[chuckling]

06:07.658 --> 06:09.452
Can someone give me another location?

06:09.535 --> 06:11.412
That guy's mom.  [chuckling]

06:11.496 --> 06:13.206
[sighs in exasperation]  Kill him.

06:13.289 --> 06:14.290
-[chuckling]
-[both grunt]

06:14.374 --> 06:15.833
-That wasn't bad enough.
-[smacking]

06:15.917 --> 06:19.253
Uncle King Julien also made the agents
do something else.

06:19.337 --> 06:24.008
Something so foul, so repulsive,
I can't even say it out loud.

06:25.510 --> 06:26.719
Heaven.

06:26.803 --> 06:27.887
Mmm-mmm.

06:27.970 --> 06:28.805
[grunting]

06:28.930 --> 06:30.473
-[knocking at door]
-[Ted] Oh, please let me in,

06:30.556 --> 06:32.600
this is the only outhouse
in the whole kingdom.

06:32.683 --> 06:35.770
[Julien and Maurice shouting]
We live in a jungle, Ted! Use a tree!

06:35.853 --> 06:36.979
Well, I never.

06:37.063 --> 06:39.398
Yeah, well, today is the day you start.

06:39.482 --> 06:42.110
Okay, but what happened
to all the agents though?

06:42.193 --> 06:46.614
Well, eventually, Uncle King Julien
got bored with the program.

06:46.697 --> 06:48.241
So, he dissolved it.

06:48.407 --> 06:49.826
-And all of the agents were
-[lemurs screaming]

06:49.909 --> 06:50.785
decommissioned.

06:50.868 --> 06:54.539
Yeah, that's a big karma killer
right there, Clover.

06:54.622 --> 06:55.915
Just... Just so you know.

06:56.374 --> 06:59.794
I didn't know he was going to...
Or I would have done something.

06:59.877 --> 07:02.630
But there was this one agent
who was never decommissioned.

07:02.922 --> 07:07.051
Pancho. In fact, Pancho was trained,
but never actually activated.

07:07.135 --> 07:10.138
And because I thought
this activation tape had been destroyed,

07:10.221 --> 07:12.473
I just, you know,
I figured Pancho wasn't a threat.

07:13.057 --> 07:14.600
So, what's the problem?

07:14.684 --> 07:16.978
But the problem is that
when you played this tape,

07:17.061 --> 07:18.396
Pancho was activated.

07:18.479 --> 07:20.565
So that means he is a threat.

07:20.648 --> 07:21.732
A threat to who?

07:21.816 --> 07:24.068
A threat to you, Your Majesty.

07:24.152 --> 07:25.862
You're Pancho's target.

07:25.945 --> 07:28.948
Which is why we need to find Pancho
before he finds you!

07:29.031 --> 07:30.783
I... I don't believe it.

07:30.867 --> 07:36.080
Why would Uncle King Julien
train a secret assassin to kill me?

07:36.622 --> 07:40.042
As his heir, you were always a threat
to Uncle King Julien's throne. Right?

07:40.126 --> 07:42.462
'Cause... 'Cause training Pancho
to take you out,

07:42.545 --> 07:44.839
that was his way of protecting himself.

07:44.922 --> 07:48.009
In case you ever did something
like you'd never do, like, you know,

07:48.092 --> 07:50.011
try and take over the kingdom, li--

07:50.094 --> 07:51.971
Hold up. That was an option?

07:52.430 --> 07:56.058
Snap! Why didn't anyone tell me
I could just take over the kingdom?

07:56.559 --> 07:59.479
So, Pancho is out there right now
looking for King Julien?

07:59.562 --> 08:01.856
How are we gonna stop
a highly trained assassin?

08:01.939 --> 08:04.108
[screams] We can't stay in here
forever, people!

08:04.192 --> 08:05.401
[screaming]

08:05.485 --> 08:07.612
-Pull yourself together, Maurice!
-[smack]

08:08.154 --> 08:09.530
-[whimpering]
-And let me think.

08:10.281 --> 08:11.115
[groans]

08:11.699 --> 08:14.035
-And move over. I need some cheek room.
-[Maurice groaning]

08:14.994 --> 08:17.580
We have to set a trap for Pancho.

08:17.663 --> 08:19.957
Normally, I'd say Mort should be the bait.

08:20.041 --> 08:22.043
Yay. [giggling]

08:22.126 --> 08:24.128
But since I'm Pancho's target,

08:24.212 --> 08:27.089
it looks like the bait's
going to have to be me.

08:27.173 --> 08:28.049
[all gasp]

08:28.132 --> 08:31.052
I can't let you do that, Your Majesty.
It's too dangerous.

08:31.135 --> 08:32.970
[shouts] Do you have
a better plan, Clover?

08:33.346 --> 08:34.764
-Uh... [sighs]
-Yeah!

08:34.847 --> 08:36.974
That's what I thought.
My plan it is.

08:37.808 --> 08:39.644
Hey! [gasps, screams]

08:39.727 --> 08:41.729
-[Mort screaming] No!
-[splashing]

08:41.812 --> 08:44.607
[Ted] Don't be such a Pushy Patrick, Mort.
Wait your turn.

08:45.107 --> 08:46.192
[Mort screaming] Thank you!

08:46.275 --> 08:47.652
Whoo! Yeah.

08:47.735 --> 08:51.197
Here I am, King Julien,
just walking all alone.

08:51.280 --> 08:54.992
Hope some recently-activated
super top-secret assassin doesn't find me

08:55.076 --> 08:56.244
[chuckles] and try to

08:56.327 --> 08:57.828
-take me out. [gasps]
-Hoo-ah!

08:57.912 --> 08:58.788
[panting]

08:58.871 --> 08:59.956
-Hoo-ah!
-[screams]

09:00.039 --> 09:01.082
Eh... [pants]

09:01.165 --> 09:03.042
-[growls] Hoo-ah.
-[screams]

09:03.125 --> 09:04.460
[screaming in panic]

09:04.544 --> 09:05.670
On second thought, Clover,

09:05.753 --> 09:07.338
-this is definitely too danger--
-[rustling]

09:07.421 --> 09:09.840
-Hoo-ah! [grunting]
-[Julien screaming]

09:09.924 --> 09:11.008
Get it away! Get it away!

09:11.092 --> 09:12.677
Decommission him.
Decommission him, Clover!

09:12.760 --> 09:15.388
-King Julien, you're okay. We got him.
-[Pancho continues grunting]

09:15.471 --> 09:18.015
Oh. I know. Totally wasn't scared.

09:19.016 --> 09:20.142
What do we do with him now?

09:20.351 --> 09:24.939
We have to go talk to Uncle King Julien
and find out how to deactivate Pancho.

09:25.022 --> 09:27.692
Since Uncle King Julien
created the Footstool Program,

09:27.775 --> 09:30.403
he's the only one who can help.

09:30.486 --> 09:32.071
-[whirring]
-[Uncle Julien] I'm saved!

09:32.154 --> 09:35.032
Oh, I'm saved.
Oh, my goodness, thank you.

09:35.116 --> 09:36.909
Thank you, thank you, there. Oh, I'm sa--

09:36.993 --> 09:39.579
Oh, it's you.

09:39.662 --> 09:42.999
Yeah, it is me, Uncle. And guess what?

09:43.082 --> 09:44.417
I found your tape.

09:44.500 --> 09:45.751
What tape?

09:45.835 --> 09:47.670
-[exclaims] Oh! Ooh!
-[chuckling]

09:47.753 --> 09:48.796
Where did you find it?

09:48.879 --> 09:50.715
Yeah, I was looking all over for this.

09:50.798 --> 09:54.552
Yeah, so you could trigger
your sleeper agent to assassinate me?

09:54.635 --> 09:57.805
-Huh? I don't know what you're ta--
-Save it, Uncle. Here's the sitch.

09:57.888 --> 10:00.474
You have to tell us
how to deactivate Pancho.

10:00.558 --> 10:01.976
Deactivate huh?

10:02.059 --> 10:03.269
We need your help.

10:03.352 --> 10:05.688
-Eh, "need" sounds a little desperate.
-Hmm... huh?

10:05.771 --> 10:07.857
I think it's more of a strong "want."

10:07.940 --> 10:08.774
[Uncle Julien chuckles]

10:08.858 --> 10:10.610
I'm not helping you. All right?

10:10.693 --> 10:14.405
Are you crazy? Do I look like someone
who helps people?

10:14.488 --> 10:19.660
Is there a sign on my forehead
that says "Free Help"? Huh?

10:19.744 --> 10:21.579
Let me at him, Your Majesty.

10:21.662 --> 10:24.165
No, no, Clover. It's cool, it's cool.

10:24.248 --> 10:27.918
Uncle King Julien would rather stay
in the bottomless pit.

10:28.044 --> 10:28.961
-[exclaims in panic]
-Laters.

10:29.045 --> 10:31.964
Okay. Wait. Whoa! Stop, stop!
I'll help you.

10:32.048 --> 10:36.302
[panting]

10:36.385 --> 10:37.345
-[grunting]
-[Uncle Julien] Ow!

10:37.428 --> 10:40.139
-[Uncle Julien] Uh, slow down, missy.
-[Mort straining]

10:40.723 --> 10:41.641
[strains]

10:41.724 --> 10:44.644
-Mort. What happened? Where's Pancho?
-[coughs]

10:44.727 --> 10:45.561
Right there.

10:45.645 --> 10:46.812

10:51.484 --> 10:53.361

10:53.444 --> 10:55.905

-[whizzing]

10:57.073 --> 10:58.157
[groans, screams]

10:58.240 --> 10:59.742
-[grunts]
-[Julien] Mama.

10:59.825 --> 11:00.660
[smack]

11:00.868 --> 11:03.913
[all groaning]

11:04.497 --> 11:05.831
Pancho took King Julien!

11:06.165 --> 11:07.083
[Uncle Julien chuckles]

11:07.166 --> 11:10.002
I guess my Footstool Program
worked after all.

11:10.127 --> 11:11.504
[laughs heartily]

11:11.587 --> 11:13.339
Ooh, tax dollars well spent.

11:13.422 --> 11:16.258
With any luck, your king is already dead.

11:16.342 --> 11:17.551
[screams] No!

11:17.635 --> 11:19.303
Good thing I'm here to take over.

11:19.387 --> 11:23.015
Okay, first things first,
I'm gonna need a crown.

11:23.099 --> 11:23.974
Ooh!

11:24.058 --> 11:27.603
Quiet! King Julien has to be alive.
We have to find him.

11:27.686 --> 11:28.604
[thunder rumbling]

11:28.687 --> 11:31.690
Ugh! Please!
[sobbing] Please don't kill me.

11:31.774 --> 11:34.610
I have so much left to do in my life.

11:34.693 --> 11:35.903
Quit your jabberin'.

11:35.986 --> 11:37.947
-I'm not gonna kill ya.
-[crying loudly]

11:38.030 --> 11:40.866
You're gonna... Wait, wait.
[stutters] You're not?

11:40.950 --> 11:44.453
Don't get me wrong. I want to.
I mean, I really, really want to.

11:44.537 --> 11:49.083
I mean, like, everything in my brain
is telling me to kill you.

11:49.166 --> 11:53.379
-[eerie music playing]
-Julien is bad. Julien is bad.

11:53.462 --> 11:54.630
Do as you were trained.

11:55.131 --> 11:58.592
Kill Julien. Pancho, do it.

11:58.676 --> 12:02.721
Oh, yes, do it. And you'll get a lolly.

12:03.556 --> 12:05.057
Oh!

12:05.141 --> 12:06.767
Watermelon.

12:07.268 --> 12:09.979
-But there's also this tiny voice...
-[whimpering]

12:10.062 --> 12:12.440
...deep inside that's telling me not to.

12:12.523 --> 12:16.527
Oh? Oh, I like that tiny voice.
Listen to that tiny voice.

12:16.819 --> 12:18.362
Eh. What else is it saying?

12:18.446 --> 12:22.825
Umm. It thinks that you might be able
to help me find out who I am.

12:22.908 --> 12:25.870
Uh, you're Pancho. Bam! There you go.

12:25.953 --> 12:28.330
Mystery solved. [chuckles nervously]
Wanna untie me now?

12:28.414 --> 12:32.334
I know my name,
but I don't know where I came from.

12:32.418 --> 12:34.920
[yelling] Where did I grow up?
Did I have a family?

12:35.004 --> 12:37.339
Uh, how do I know?
Why are you yelling at me?

12:37.423 --> 12:38.424
I barely even know you.

12:38.507 --> 12:41.343
[yelling] You have to help me!
I'm in the dark here!

12:41.427 --> 12:42.928
Okay! Okay!

12:43.012 --> 12:46.348
Take it easy. Do you remember
anything from your past?

12:46.432 --> 12:48.434
-I mean, anything at all?
-Um.

12:48.517 --> 12:51.020
From my pa... Just a house.

12:53.022 --> 12:54.148
With a red door.

12:54.231 --> 12:57.359
A red door. A red do-- [gasps]

12:57.443 --> 12:59.612
I know the house you're talking about.

12:59.695 --> 13:00.696
You do?

13:00.779 --> 13:04.700
Yeah. That abandoned old hut
on the outskirts of the kingdom.

13:04.783 --> 13:08.496
That's where my garage/punk/rock/ska band,

13:08.579 --> 13:11.582
Wiper Fluid,
used to practice back in lemur school.

13:11.832 --> 13:18.506
-[rock music playing]
-[Julien growling]

13:19.673 --> 13:21.383
Sadly, the band broke up.

13:21.467 --> 13:23.969
So, uh, about that hut...

13:24.053 --> 13:27.223
What can I say? Fame went to our heads.

13:27.348 --> 13:32.937
-[Julien growling]
-[rock music playing]

13:33.020 --> 13:35.481
Oh, how I miss being up on that stage.

13:35.564 --> 13:38.275
-[Pancho whimpering]
-All the adoring fans.

13:38.359 --> 13:40.569
Oh, right. Uh, this isn't about me

13:40.653 --> 13:42.655
and my shattered dreams
of musical stardom. [chuckles]

13:42.738 --> 13:45.991
Back to you. Uh, I remember
where that house is!

13:46.075 --> 13:48.244
I will take you there. [exclaims]

13:48.994 --> 13:51.247
-[Uncle Julien panting]
-[Clover screams in frustration]

13:51.330 --> 13:53.958
It's no use. Pancho is a trained agent.

13:54.041 --> 13:56.585
He knows how to move around
without leaving a trail.

13:56.669 --> 13:59.004
-We are never gonna find King Julien.
-Oh!

13:59.088 --> 14:00.965
-Look!
-Not now, Mort!

14:01.048 --> 14:03.509
But it's part of King Julien's crown!

14:03.592 --> 14:05.177
-What?
-Hmm? Let me see that.

14:05.261 --> 14:06.178
-Mort's right.
-Uh-huh.

14:06.262 --> 14:07.137
[Clover] Aha!

14:07.263 --> 14:09.682
King Julien is leaving us a trail.

14:09.765 --> 14:11.392
They're headed this way. Come on!

14:11.475 --> 14:13.227
It's so tight!

14:13.310 --> 14:14.562
[sniffs, whimpers]

14:14.645 --> 14:18.899
I don't think I can. [groaning]

14:18.983 --> 14:21.819
Oh, come on. We don't have time
for all of that. Get up.

14:21.902 --> 14:23.487
Just go on without me.

14:23.571 --> 14:25.823
We can't leave him here
'cause I don't trust him.

14:25.906 --> 14:27.741
I know, but he's slowing us down.

14:27.825 --> 14:30.619
Besides, he's an old man.
How much trouble can he cause?

14:32.288 --> 14:33.789
Right. Better tie him up.

14:37.585 --> 14:38.752
[chuckling]

14:39.670 --> 14:41.255

14:41.338 --> 14:42.423

[grunting]

14:53.559 --> 14:54.393
This is it.

14:57.563 --> 14:59.940
I'm starting to remember. I lived here.

15:00.441 --> 15:03.193
With my family. Oh. I had a family!

15:03.277 --> 15:06.030
That's great. Oh! What is that smell?

15:06.113 --> 15:08.908
I had a dad. Yeah, I can almost see him.

15:08.991 --> 15:09.950
He loved to garden.

15:12.411 --> 15:15.706
-Hmm.
-And my mom, she had blue eyes.

15:16.957 --> 15:20.586
And my sister, she always wore
a little yellow bow in her hair.

15:21.837 --> 15:23.797
Uh, bad news, Pancho.

15:23.881 --> 15:27.301
-What?
-I'm sitting on your family.

15:28.385 --> 15:30.429
No! It can't be!

15:30.512 --> 15:33.766
You mean, I never had a [screams] family?

15:33.849 --> 15:37.394
Sorry, Pancho, but, you know,
maybe you're better off.

15:37.478 --> 15:40.147
I mean, families are pretty overrated.

15:40.230 --> 15:41.982
And there's always so much drama,

15:42.066 --> 15:45.527
like when your uncle tries to kill you
and then take over your kingdom.

15:45.611 --> 15:47.154
[Uncle Julien] Or like when your
pesky nephew

15:47.237 --> 15:48.238
-takes your crown...
-Mm-hm.

15:48.322 --> 15:49.782
-...and refuses to give it back.
-Mm-hm.

15:49.865 --> 15:53.243
Exactly. Wait... Uncle?
Where did you come from?

15:53.327 --> 15:54.495
How did you get in here?

15:54.578 --> 15:57.706
Oh, I had a bunch of underground tunnels
made during my reign,

15:57.790 --> 15:59.458
so I could move around quickly,

15:59.541 --> 16:02.086
mostly due to my
Irritable Bowel Syndrome.

16:02.169 --> 16:03.879
You never know when you have to go.

16:03.963 --> 16:05.047
Okay, gross.

16:05.130 --> 16:06.465
[screams] You!

16:06.548 --> 16:08.467
-[eerie music playing]
-Do as you're trained to do.

16:08.550 --> 16:12.721
Do as you're trained to do, Pancho.

16:12.805 --> 16:14.056
Lolly.

16:14.473 --> 16:15.766
[laughing]

16:15.849 --> 16:19.186
Destroy Julien.

16:19.269 --> 16:21.230
It's time, Pancho.

16:21.313 --> 16:23.732
It's time for you to fulfill your mission.

16:23.816 --> 16:25.943
Destroy Julien.

16:26.026 --> 16:29.154
-Yes. Must destroy Julien.
-Uh. No. Hold up.

16:29.238 --> 16:31.782
-I just helped you find your house, man.
-[growling]

16:31.865 --> 16:36.370
And F-Y-by the way, Uncle King Julien
isn't the king anymore. I am.

16:36.453 --> 16:39.123
So, technically, you should take him out
and not me.

16:39.206 --> 16:43.002
-Yes. Must destroy Uncle King Julien.
-No! No, no, no, no.

16:43.085 --> 16:46.380
Julien is your target.
Remember your training.

16:46.463 --> 16:49.550
-Must destroy Julien.
-No! Remember that little voice?

16:49.633 --> 16:52.511
[speaking in kid's voice]
"Don't hurt King Julien. He's delightful,

16:52.594 --> 16:56.056
and so handsome,
and he didn't erase your memories

16:56.140 --> 16:58.267
and brainwash you into being an assassin."

16:58.350 --> 17:01.186
Yeah. You. You did this to me!

17:07.693 --> 17:09.987
Wait... What? What did you do?

17:10.070 --> 17:13.574
I just triggered phase six.
The Final Protocol.

17:13.657 --> 17:16.618
I'm gonna go out on a limb
and say that's bad, right?

17:16.702 --> 17:17.953
Oh, yeah.

17:18.203 --> 17:22.041
[shouting] Pancho! Come back!
Pancho! [groans]

17:22.833 --> 17:24.793
King Julien, you're alive!

17:24.877 --> 17:27.087
Oh, group hug. [groans]

17:27.171 --> 17:28.338
Where's Pancho?

17:28.422 --> 17:32.760
Uncle King Julien triggered something
called the Last Prototype or something.

17:32.843 --> 17:35.387
I can't remember exactly,
but it sounded bad.

17:35.471 --> 17:39.808
[gasps] No. Not the Final Protocol.

17:39.892 --> 17:41.101
Oh, yeah. That's it.

17:41.685 --> 17:43.687
I know where Pancho's going.

-[gasps]
-King Julien, what do we do?

18:01.455 --> 18:03.874
Don't worry, Maurice.
I'll deal with Pancho.

18:03.957 --> 18:06.752
I just need you three to get on that boat
and create a diversion.

18:06.835 --> 18:07.795
On it.

18:43.539 --> 18:45.582
-[Clover screaming]
-[grunting]

18:46.834 --> 18:49.086
[groaning]

18:49.169 --> 18:50.254
[screams]

18:50.337 --> 18:51.338
[explosion]

18:54.758 --> 18:58.137
Not good, Clover.
We're standing on an explosive mine.

18:58.220 --> 19:03.600
Easy. Easy. We're light enough
that they probably won't explode.

19:03.684 --> 19:04.518
Probably?

19:04.601 --> 19:07.980
-We just have to tread lightly.
-[both exclaim]

19:08.063 --> 19:09.064
Follow me.

19:09.148 --> 19:11.650
[all grunting with effort]

19:11.733 --> 19:16.446
[grunting]

19:16.530 --> 19:18.991
-[timer beeping]
-Eh!

19:20.242 --> 19:23.745
Okay. If I were an off button,
where would I be?

19:23.954 --> 19:24.913
-Ah!
-[beeps]

19:25.789 --> 19:27.166
[beeping rapidly]

19:27.749 --> 19:28.959
No, no, no, stop!

19:29.459 --> 19:31.044
Fontanelle ellipsis schmear.

19:31.128 --> 19:32.212
[Clover] Pancho!

19:33.255 --> 19:35.299
[both straining]

19:40.220 --> 19:41.638
How do we make it stop?

19:41.722 --> 19:43.974
-I don't know! I tried everything!
-[grunting, groaning]

19:44.057 --> 19:46.393
Actually, there is one thing
I haven't tried.

19:46.476 --> 19:48.729
[Julien screaming]

19:48.812 --> 19:50.439
[all screaming]

19:50.522 --> 19:51.690
-I don't know! I don't know!
-[banging]

19:52.774 --> 19:53.901
[both grunting]

19:59.406 --> 20:02.326
[groans]

20:03.076 --> 20:04.161
-[timer beeping rapidly]
-[banging]

20:04.244 --> 20:05.704
-[gasps] Clover!
-[groaning]

20:05.787 --> 20:07.247
Fontanelle ellipsis schmear.

20:07.331 --> 20:10.834
Listen to me, Pancho,
you don't have to do this.

20:10.918 --> 20:13.003
[Julien] Remember your family!

20:14.087 --> 20:16.798
We love you, Pancho. [echoing]

20:16.882 --> 20:19.426
No, Dad. No. It's all a lie!

20:19.509 --> 20:22.179
[shouting] You're not real.
I don't have a family!

20:22.262 --> 20:26.183
You're wrong. We are your family.
The entire kingdom.

20:26.266 --> 20:29.186
-Me, Maurice, Clover, Mort--
-[screams] No!

20:29.770 --> 20:30.938
Fine, Mort is out.

20:31.021 --> 20:33.106
My point is, you're not alone.

20:33.190 --> 20:34.566
You have us.

20:34.650 --> 20:36.777
Stop the countdown before it's too late.

20:36.860 --> 20:38.487
Don't destroy your home.

20:38.570 --> 20:42.449
-[eerie music playing]
-[echoing]  Fontanelle ellipsis schm...

20:43.033 --> 20:45.452
What the... Hey. What? Whoa!

20:45.535 --> 20:48.080
-Pancho, you're back!
-[exclaims nervously]

20:49.122 --> 20:50.123
[bawling]

20:50.249 --> 20:51.208
Okay, buddy.

20:51.291 --> 20:52.793
We can all have a good cry later,

20:52.876 --> 20:55.420
but right now,
you need to stop that countdown clock!

20:55.504 --> 20:56.630
Yeah. Okay.

20:56.713 --> 20:58.173
[clicking]

20:58.257 --> 21:01.134
[beeping]

21:02.010 --> 21:02.844
Did he do it?

21:05.222 --> 21:07.099
-[Julien laughing]
-[Mort] The kingdom is safe.

21:07.182 --> 21:08.225
Hooray!

21:08.308 --> 21:09.268
We did it!

21:10.102 --> 21:10.978
[splashing]

21:11.061 --> 21:12.604
Think again, nephew.

21:12.688 --> 21:15.482
You again? Really? Newsflash, Uncle.

21:15.565 --> 21:18.485
Your Final Protocol? Yeah, it didn't work.

21:18.568 --> 21:20.487
We won. In your face.

21:20.570 --> 21:22.906
Oh, my goodness. You are so right.

21:22.990 --> 21:25.784
Operation Footstool
was a complete failure.

21:25.867 --> 21:30.872
And you, you big lump of sea salt taffy,
you're a disappointment.

21:30.956 --> 21:35.502
Which is why I created the Final Protocol
in the first place.

21:35.585 --> 21:41.341
And also why I had my missile outfitted
with a manual override code

21:41.425 --> 21:43.969
that only I know.

21:44.094 --> 21:44.928
Oh, boo-hoo.

21:45.012 --> 21:46.054
-Huh?
-Manual who?

21:47.347 --> 21:48.765
If I can't have my kingdom...

21:49.766 --> 21:50.851
no one can.

21:50.934 --> 21:53.478
-[Uncle Julien laughing maniacally]
-[engine firing up]

21:54.563 --> 21:57.858
This is for my family. [grunts]

21:57.941 --> 22:00.068
-[groaning]
-[rumbling]

22:00.152 --> 22:03.447
[Uncle Julien] Why does this keep
happening to me?

22:04.906 --> 22:07.075
[lemur 1] Oh, I thought
it was really nice.

22:07.159 --> 22:09.703
-You have a lovely home. Nice house.
-[mumbling indistinctly]

22:09.786 --> 22:11.621
Great party, Pancho.

22:11.705 --> 22:13.165
[Mort laughing]

22:13.707 --> 22:14.624
[sighs in relief]

22:14.750 --> 22:19.046
I just wanted to thank you for helping me
figure out who I am, King Julien.

22:19.129 --> 22:21.548
-I'm no longer [shouts] in the dark here!
-[exclaims]

22:21.631 --> 22:22.799
[laughs]

22:22.924 --> 22:23.842
Sure thing, buddy.

22:23.925 --> 22:27.888
Yeah, I am so glad I found my family.

22:29.639 --> 22:30.932
My real family.

22:32.517 --> 22:34.770
We're gonna be together forever

22:34.853 --> 22:36.146
and ever

22:37.147 --> 22:38.440
and ever

22:39.316 --> 22:40.442
and ever.

22:41.234 --> 22:43.278
[eerie music playing]
