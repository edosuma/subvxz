01:09.286 --> 01:12.289

01:14.596 --> 01:17.164
<i>The governor has
urged anyone that can</i>

01:17.338 --> 01:21.603
to please leave their home
in a calm and orderly fashion.

01:47.759 --> 01:49.718
Well, it looks like this
is home for the night.

01:49.892 --> 01:51.198
Fuck.

01:58.727 --> 02:02.034
Great.

02:11.914 --> 02:14.134
Dude, it's a fucking hurricane.

02:14.308 --> 02:15.787
What's that gonna do?

02:15.961 --> 02:17.398
Well, unless you plan
on out running it,

02:17.572 --> 02:19.487
it's the best we got
till it passes.

02:22.925 --> 02:24.405
What's your name anyway?

02:25.319 --> 02:26.885
Summer.

02:27.059 --> 02:28.365
Clarence.

02:30.802 --> 02:32.674
Been here long?

02:32.848 --> 02:34.241
Six months.

02:34.415 --> 02:39.159
I was in a band...
and we broke up.

02:41.291 --> 02:44.164
All the fuckers moved home,
left me with the rent

02:44.338 --> 02:47.036
that I can't make, obviously.

02:47.210 --> 02:48.472
It sounds familiar.

02:53.260 --> 02:54.609
Gimme a hand?

02:56.698 --> 02:58.090
Looks like you got it.

03:02.225 --> 03:03.922
You know, I had some friends
come through town yesterday

03:04.096 --> 03:05.750
offered me
a ride up to Arkansas.

03:08.100 --> 03:09.667
Should have taken it.

03:09.972 --> 03:11.669
Didn't think the second coming
of Hurricane Katrina

03:11.843 --> 03:13.584
would lock us in her sights.

03:13.758 --> 03:15.543
You even old enough
to remember Katrina?

03:15.717 --> 03:19.895
I was six. Just old enough
to remember levees breaking.

03:23.072 --> 03:24.421
Oh, shit.

03:25.944 --> 03:27.859
Goddamn wind.

03:28.033 --> 03:29.557
I got this one.

03:29.731 --> 03:30.906
Mind seeing if there's
anything we can burn

03:31.080 --> 03:32.647
that won't level the place?

03:34.126 --> 03:35.345
Wouldn't count on it.

03:44.528 --> 03:46.182
You know I was in a band once.

03:47.052 --> 03:48.532
Uh.

04:09.858 --> 04:11.033
Clarence?

05:02.606 --> 05:04.129
Ah!

08:06.007 --> 08:09.010
Yo, he trying to kill us
out here or what?

08:09.184 --> 08:10.533
He's right you know.

08:10.838 --> 08:11.752
I can hardly see a
goddamn thing up here.

08:11.926 --> 08:13.536
It's a shit show.

08:13.710 --> 08:15.190
I told you
we should've turned back.

08:15.495 --> 08:17.758
But Shane fucking left
with the goddamn forecast.

08:17.932 --> 08:19.629
You know, that's why I only
trust this weather app.

08:19.803 --> 08:21.849
Sooner we drop these sweethearts
off the better, right?

08:22.023 --> 08:23.415
I don't know.

08:24.678 --> 08:26.636
I think we should pull over
and wait the storm out.

08:26.810 --> 08:29.552
Oh yeah? And when
you think that's gonna be?

08:29.726 --> 08:32.250
I don't know. Why don't
you ask that weather app?

08:35.471 --> 08:37.691
Yeah, it ain't going
anywhere anytime soon.

08:38.822 --> 08:40.780
God's gonna be pissing on us
for the rest of the night.

08:40.955 --> 08:43.479
Well, it's only gonna
get worse at dark.

08:43.653 --> 08:46.482
Eh, you know, Lutree's
pretty close to here.

08:46.656 --> 08:48.963
Why don't you radio
that sheriff and see

08:49.137 --> 08:50.965
if she doesn't mind
taking us in for the night.

08:51.139 --> 08:53.489
- The pretty one?
- That's right.

08:53.663 --> 08:54.795
Yeah, I'm sure she'll just

08:55.143 --> 08:57.972
roll out the red carpet
for all of us.

08:58.146 --> 08:59.800
Well, it's better than crashing

08:59.974 --> 09:01.584
and letting a bunch of
inmates escape, isn't it?

09:05.066 --> 09:09.287
Okay. Truck's full of gas.
Skis are ready to go.

09:09.461 --> 09:10.637
Keys are on Omar.

09:12.769 --> 09:14.031
As far as those keys go,

09:14.205 --> 09:15.511
you give them to
no one except me?

09:15.685 --> 09:16.556
- You copy that.
- Copy.

09:16.730 --> 09:18.079
Okay.

09:18.253 --> 09:19.689
God looked down
on the human race

09:19.994 --> 09:22.344
and He saw wickedness, violence,
and evil everywhere.

09:25.086 --> 09:26.653
It's the story of the flood.

09:27.044 --> 09:29.525
It symbolizes God's punishment
for sin...

09:29.699 --> 09:31.005
That's comforting.

09:31.179 --> 09:32.920
Let's get
these things loaded up

09:33.094 --> 09:34.835
and let's move. Come on.

10:11.567 --> 10:13.525
<i>The storm has already
decimated the Caribbean.</i>

10:13.700 --> 10:16.746
Copy that.
Drive safe out there.

10:21.838 --> 10:22.926
You gotta be kidding me.

10:25.625 --> 10:27.627
Where the hell is Pine?

10:27.801 --> 10:31.195
I haven't seen him.
Never know with that guy though.

10:31.369 --> 10:32.588
What is that?

10:33.807 --> 10:35.460
Stress call.

10:35.635 --> 10:36.897
Department of corrections.

10:37.593 --> 10:38.986
And?

10:39.334 --> 10:41.118
Got a bus full of prisoners
heading our way.

10:41.292 --> 10:42.729
Got caught in the storm,
they need a place

10:42.903 --> 10:44.731
to hunker down until it's safe.

10:44.905 --> 10:47.690
- How many prisoners?
- Five.

10:47.864 --> 10:49.518
Jeez, why didn't
you come tell me?

10:49.692 --> 10:50.954
Well, state of Louisiana

10:51.389 --> 10:53.174
is gonna be underwater
by bacon and eggs time.

10:53.348 --> 10:55.567
All right.
Keep an eye up for the bus.

10:55.742 --> 10:57.308
Tell Deputy Pine

10:57.657 --> 10:59.354
if he wants to keep his job,
to find me immediately.

10:59.528 --> 11:00.964
<i>...to evacuate
across three states.</i>

11:01.138 --> 11:02.836
You're the sheriff, Sheriff.

11:03.010 --> 11:04.315
<i>...the combined states</i>

11:04.489 --> 11:06.491
<i>of Louisiana and Alabama.</i>

11:06.709 --> 11:10.278
<i>Nearly seven million told to
evacuate across three states.</i>

11:10.452 --> 11:13.281
<i>Already hundreds of
thousands without power.</i>

11:41.570 --> 11:44.051
It's just looking pretty bad
out here I mean, look at it.

11:46.618 --> 11:48.533
The worse it gets,
the better it is for us.

11:48.708 --> 11:49.621
Yeah.

11:58.065 --> 12:00.589
Here comes our ride.

12:04.549 --> 12:05.812
Lock and load.

12:15.517 --> 12:16.692
Where the hell
are they going?

12:17.127 --> 12:18.128
I thought they were
supposed to turn.

12:18.302 --> 12:18.999
So what the fuck's up, Rafe?

12:21.088 --> 12:22.916
Change of plans. Follow 'em.

12:38.192 --> 12:40.020
<i>Highway patrol
and local officials</i>

12:40.194 --> 12:42.413
<i>have declared
a statewide emergency</i>

12:42.587 --> 12:45.590
<i>as these unprecedented
storms continue to rage</i>

12:45.765 --> 12:47.331
<i>across Southwestern Louisiana.</i>

12:49.420 --> 12:51.422
Oh, hey, Sheriff. Whitlock
said you wanted to see me?

12:52.423 --> 12:54.208
Yes, I did.

12:54.382 --> 12:55.687
Okay. What's up?

12:58.255 --> 12:59.604
Look at my feet.

12:59.909 --> 13:01.215
Didn't I ask you to
stack some sandbags

13:01.389 --> 13:02.520
in the alley near the back door?

13:02.694 --> 13:04.131
Yes, ma'am.

13:04.435 --> 13:07.264
But Whitlock asked me
to mop the cells, so--

13:07.438 --> 13:08.875
Well, now you're
on sandbag duty.

13:09.049 --> 13:10.267
Rain is pouring down.

13:10.615 --> 13:11.965
I got a busload
of prisoners coming in.

13:12.139 --> 13:13.488
And if you'd done
what I'd asked,

13:13.923 --> 13:15.490
we wouldn't be walking
around in gumbo right now.

13:15.664 --> 13:19.886
Sorry, Sheriff. Uh, I'm on it.

13:20.060 --> 13:22.540
Hey, wait, did you just say
we have prisoners coming in?

13:22.714 --> 13:25.543
- Pine.
- Anyone famous?

13:28.111 --> 13:29.809
I'm on it. I'm on it.

13:29.983 --> 13:31.636
Oh.

13:32.942 --> 13:34.117
My God.

15:54.344 --> 15:57.521
Sheriff Newman should
deploy the mayor for this.

16:11.796 --> 16:15.452
Well, I'm gonna
go find the sheriff.

16:15.626 --> 16:19.413
All right, make it quick, okay?
I don't like babysitting.

16:28.030 --> 16:29.249
The guests are here.

18:14.963 --> 18:16.007
What the fuck
are they doing outside

18:16.182 --> 18:17.661
of the goddamn police station?

18:30.761 --> 18:33.068
Ah, thanks for taking
us in tonight, Sheriff.

18:33.242 --> 18:35.375
Dale Elkins, Department
of Corrections.

18:35.549 --> 18:37.072
Probably heard of me before.

18:40.554 --> 18:42.904
Couldn't leave you to drown
out there, now could we?

18:43.078 --> 18:44.688
To tell you the truth,
it might be better

18:44.862 --> 18:47.300
if some of them actually did.

18:48.562 --> 18:51.913
You know we don't have any food
or enough holding cells?

18:52.087 --> 18:54.655
Radios and trial line's
been in and outta service

18:54.829 --> 18:56.483
ever since the storm started.

18:56.657 --> 18:58.311
Gotta be honest
with you, Elkins.

18:58.485 --> 18:59.442
I've had enough
problems here tonight

18:59.616 --> 19:01.183
without having you here.

19:01.575 --> 19:03.664
Well, I guess we won't be
feeding them after midnight.

19:06.928 --> 19:08.103
That's a movie reference.

19:11.367 --> 19:13.195
We'll try and be
as painless as possible.

19:14.936 --> 19:16.720
Okay, I'm gonna go
get the gremlins.

19:16.894 --> 19:18.244
Follow me.

19:42.616 --> 19:44.661
I can't fucking believe this.

20:03.811 --> 20:06.248
I say we just
get the hell outta here.

20:06.422 --> 20:09.947
We ain't going nowhere,
and neither are they.

20:12.167 --> 20:13.168
Our whole plan is fucked now.

20:13.342 --> 20:15.083
This doesn't make any sense.

20:15.953 --> 20:18.608
Yeah, well,
we ain't turning back.

20:18.782 --> 20:22.395
All right, if you numb nuts
couldn't tell,

20:22.569 --> 20:25.267
there's a raging storm
going on out there.

20:25.441 --> 20:27.661
Roads are too dangerous
to drive,

20:27.835 --> 20:29.097
and we wanna make sure
y'all make it

20:29.271 --> 20:32.361
to your final destinations safe.

20:32.535 --> 20:34.711
So we prepared
accommodations for y'all

20:34.885 --> 20:37.366
at the Lutree Sheriff's
Department for tonight.

20:42.589 --> 20:45.026
You remember Yemen, right?

20:45.200 --> 20:47.898
I keep telling you, this storm,
it works in our favor.

20:49.160 --> 20:50.597
And it's good for us.

20:50.771 --> 20:52.381
Take a look where we are.

20:52.555 --> 20:55.254
Yeah, outside of
a goddamn police station

20:55.428 --> 20:58.257
in the middle of
a fucking 50-year storm.

20:59.997 --> 21:03.087
I want you on your best behavior
while we're here.

21:03.262 --> 21:06.395
Think of this as a...
a field trip.

21:06.569 --> 21:09.703
For some of you, this'll be
the last one you ever get.

21:09.877 --> 21:11.444
There gonna be ice cream?

21:11.618 --> 21:12.836
Banana split
in this motherfucker.

21:13.010 --> 21:14.055
I like me chocolate.

21:14.229 --> 21:15.361
Shut the fuck up.

21:15.535 --> 21:16.666
laughing]

22:05.846 --> 22:07.369
This is our chance.

22:09.284 --> 22:12.287
This is our chance, and we
are gonna bust on in there,

22:12.461 --> 22:14.028
and we are gonna get him out.

22:18.728 --> 22:20.426
Yeah, there's
cops in there.

22:20.600 --> 22:22.253
Like we've never
taken down no cops before

22:22.428 --> 22:24.255
if we had to.

22:24.430 --> 22:27.694
Can't be more than four or
five of them on duty anyways.

22:31.654 --> 22:33.090
I don't think so.
I mean, the prisoners came out.

22:33.264 --> 22:34.483
There's only two of them.

22:34.875 --> 22:36.529
If there was more,
we would've seen them.

22:40.794 --> 22:42.796
You know, she's right.

22:42.970 --> 22:44.537
Here's what we're gonna do.

22:44.711 --> 22:45.973
When we're done,
we're gonna ditch the truck.

22:46.147 --> 22:47.496
We're gonna meet
at the rendezvous point

22:47.670 --> 22:49.933
on the jet skis as we planned.

22:50.107 --> 22:52.414
Then on, we can go our
merry fucking ways.

22:52.588 --> 22:54.547
As long as this storm
keeps falling like it is,

22:54.721 --> 22:56.810
don't think anybody's
gonna stop us.

23:00.422 --> 23:01.423
All right.

23:01.597 --> 23:02.642
Single-file line, gentlemen.

23:02.816 --> 23:04.295
Act like you wanna be here.

23:16.351 --> 23:17.744
Do you wanna do the honors?

23:18.527 --> 23:21.400
- It's your ship.
- Yeah, and it's sinking.

23:22.531 --> 23:24.228
All right.

23:24.403 --> 23:25.360
My name is Sheriff Newman.

23:25.534 --> 23:27.362
This is Deputy Whitlock.

23:27.536 --> 23:31.148
Welcome to the Lutree
on this very wet and stormy day.

23:31.322 --> 23:32.889
Let's get a few things straight.

23:34.108 --> 23:35.544
You're in my house now.

23:37.372 --> 23:38.373
Settle down.

23:38.547 --> 23:39.940
Oh, shit, you settle down.

23:41.724 --> 23:43.726
Just letting you know you better
be on your best behavior.

23:43.900 --> 23:46.468
Don't be fooled by the fact
that I am a woman.

23:46.642 --> 23:48.296
My father was
the sheriff in this town,

23:48.514 --> 23:51.081
and he taught me how to use
a gun when I was four years old.

23:51.255 --> 23:53.954
I will not hesitate
to shoot you if I have to.

23:56.957 --> 23:59.829
Please, by all means,

24:01.352 --> 24:03.485
fire away.

24:03.659 --> 24:06.532
Well...
I'll be sure to aim right

24:06.706 --> 24:08.838
at that stupid thing on
your forehead when I do.

24:09.012 --> 24:11.014
Ah.

24:11.841 --> 24:13.887
Right in the kisser.

24:14.844 --> 24:16.193
Fuck you, dark meat.

24:16.367 --> 24:18.413
I bet your mama like dark meat.

24:18.587 --> 24:20.633
What's your name, bullseye?

24:20.807 --> 24:22.156
Floyd McGraw.

24:23.462 --> 24:26.029
When I call your name,
I need you to step forward.

24:27.466 --> 24:29.729
Big Jim Pruett?

24:31.121 --> 24:32.340
Yes, ma'am.

24:33.907 --> 24:35.212
How'd I guess?

24:35.604 --> 24:36.779
Well, I reckon it says
they call me Big Jim

24:37.084 --> 24:38.433
in your file there,
and I'm the--

24:42.437 --> 24:43.699
I'm the second biggest one here.

24:43.873 --> 24:45.962
You reckoned right.

24:46.136 --> 24:47.355
Says you're looking at a nickel,

24:47.529 --> 24:49.052
drug charge, second offense.

24:49.226 --> 24:51.577
Well, you know what's
trailer trash, ma'am.

24:51.751 --> 24:53.492
We only go for two things.

24:53.666 --> 24:54.754
Yeah, what's that?

24:54.928 --> 24:57.234
Cooking meth and growing weed.

24:58.497 --> 25:01.674
Okay, step back, Big Jim.

25:01.848 --> 25:03.632
Jonathan Apone.

25:03.806 --> 25:05.547
Who the fuck is that though?

25:07.244 --> 25:08.637
Look here, ma'am.

25:08.942 --> 25:10.552
I haven't heard that name
in a long time.

25:10.726 --> 25:12.946
Where I'm from, everybody
call me Jack Boy Jox,

25:13.120 --> 25:14.643
the neighborhood jacker.

25:14.817 --> 25:16.515
Only my mama call me Jonathan,

25:16.689 --> 25:18.212
unless you wanna
be my White mama.

25:19.561 --> 25:22.521
How's your mama feel about
her boy doing time in jail?

25:22.695 --> 25:24.740
Well, mama was just mad
I got caught.

25:24.914 --> 25:26.350
I didn't make it home that night
to pay that rent.

25:26.525 --> 25:27.743
My little brothers and sisters

25:28.091 --> 25:29.615
on the motherfucking
street... evicted.

25:29.789 --> 25:31.965
Now, I'm in here
with you White folks.

25:33.401 --> 25:35.490
Thank you, Jonathan.
You can step back.

25:38.449 --> 25:41.104
Angelo Cooper, is it?

25:41.278 --> 25:42.802
That's correct.

25:42.976 --> 25:44.020
Step forward.

25:45.369 --> 25:47.023
Murder one.

25:47.197 --> 25:48.938
It's big.

25:49.112 --> 25:51.114
I got a big dick, too.

25:51.288 --> 25:52.463
You ever seen one?

25:53.682 --> 25:56.250
Not one this ugly.
Step back.

25:56.424 --> 25:57.730
You're feisty.

25:58.731 --> 26:00.254
I like feisty.

26:01.777 --> 26:03.823
That must make you...

26:04.911 --> 26:06.521
Russell Cody, ma'am.

26:07.391 --> 26:10.656
That's a bonafide cop killer
right there, Sheriff.

26:10.830 --> 26:12.614
Ain't that right, Russell Cody?

26:12.788 --> 26:16.400
Anybody kills a cop should burn,

26:16.575 --> 26:19.578
spend the rest of their time
in hell as far as I'm concerned.

26:23.451 --> 26:25.322
Step back, Mr. Cody.

26:27.194 --> 26:29.326
All right. As you can see, it's
a tight squeeze here tonight,

26:29.500 --> 26:31.459
and we're not food prepped,

26:31.633 --> 26:34.549
so this isn't gonna
be fun for any of us.

26:34.723 --> 26:36.333
It's a bitch of a squall
out there, so we're just gonna

26:36.507 --> 26:38.684
have to make the most of it
until the morning.

26:38.858 --> 26:40.294
Understood?

26:40.468 --> 26:41.556
- Yes, ma'am.
- Yes, ma'am.

26:41.730 --> 26:42.905
Yes, ma'am.

27:08.627 --> 27:10.019
You sure got nice nails, Jox.

27:10.193 --> 27:12.021
I appreciate that there, boy.

27:12.195 --> 27:13.196
Feel good.

27:13.414 --> 27:14.502
My girlfriend told me to get one

27:14.676 --> 27:16.025
of those manicures you've got,

27:16.199 --> 27:18.114
but I don't know...

27:18.288 --> 27:19.725
Seems a little girly.

27:20.726 --> 27:22.249
Hey, y'all.

27:22.553 --> 27:24.599
Y'all don't think this is cruel
and unusual right here?

27:24.773 --> 27:26.079
I can't even do my pushups.

27:26.340 --> 27:28.385
Oh, I'm sorry, baby,
poor sweetheart.

27:28.559 --> 27:30.431
Why don't y'all just make
yourselves comfortable, okay?

27:30.605 --> 27:32.172
We're gonna be here
for a minute.

27:34.174 --> 27:36.002
Hope y'all can swim.

27:36.176 --> 27:37.917
What you think, Black people
can't swim or something?

27:38.091 --> 27:41.355
Got our resident
comedian in here, huh, Jox?

27:41.529 --> 27:43.009
Why don't you go
sit your ass down?

27:43.313 --> 27:45.751
Yeah, let me out this cage
and see what happens.

27:45.925 --> 27:47.970
I'mma tase your ass
is what's gonna happen.

27:48.144 --> 27:49.668
All right.
All right.

27:50.016 --> 27:51.104
It'll feel real good
in this water, too.

27:51.278 --> 27:53.976
Okay, okay.

27:56.587 --> 27:58.502
Where the hell is Pine?

27:58.677 --> 28:00.504
Correction ain't seen nothing.

28:00.679 --> 28:02.332
Get down.

28:05.422 --> 28:06.859
Was that gunfire?

28:10.514 --> 28:12.516
No, that's probably
just thunder.

28:49.553 --> 28:51.642
Oh, they popping off.
They're definitely gunfire.

28:55.385 --> 28:58.693
Reminds me of
goddamn Afghanistan.

29:09.835 --> 29:11.401
Goddammit,
there ain't no signal.

29:11.575 --> 29:12.576
Yeah, sheriff said
it's been that way

29:12.751 --> 29:14.404
since the storm started.

29:14.753 --> 29:18.844
What the hell have you two
ass clowns gotten us into now?

29:20.149 --> 29:22.673
What the hell are
you doing, Elkins?

29:22.848 --> 29:23.892
Don't do anything stupid.

29:24.066 --> 29:25.502
I'm gonna go check it out.

29:25.676 --> 29:27.113
I just said
don't do anything stupid.

29:27.287 --> 29:29.680
He's right, Elkins.
Listen to him.

29:29.855 --> 29:31.508
You stay here and watch them.

29:31.682 --> 29:33.162
Son of a bitch.

29:35.164 --> 29:36.426
Goddamn it.

30:08.632 --> 30:09.808
Clear.

30:11.461 --> 30:12.811
Watch your six.

30:42.318 --> 30:44.233
How many of you
are still in here?

30:46.714 --> 30:48.237
Who the fuck are you?

30:51.414 --> 30:53.373
Well, it seems like you may
have a little flooding problem

30:53.547 --> 30:55.418
in here today, Sheriff.

30:55.592 --> 30:57.203
It rains, it pours.

30:58.769 --> 31:00.423
Yes, it does.

31:05.646 --> 31:07.082
Besides yourself
and the two guards

31:07.256 --> 31:08.518
that were on the bus,

31:08.692 --> 31:10.825
how many others
are still here?

31:18.354 --> 31:20.182
And don't lie to me.

31:22.968 --> 31:24.230
It's just us.

31:26.623 --> 31:29.104
Okay, then, then this
is what we're gonna do.

31:29.278 --> 31:30.932
You're gonna toss
out your weapons,

31:31.324 --> 31:32.455
and you're gonna come out from
behind there nice and slowly.

31:32.629 --> 31:34.544
That's what we're gonna do.

31:36.851 --> 31:39.158
How do I know
you're not gonna shoot us?

31:41.812 --> 31:43.031
Well...

31:43.640 --> 31:44.728
Freeze.

32:03.486 --> 32:07.273
I told you
not to lie to me, Sheriff.

32:07.447 --> 32:09.188
All right, we're coming out.

32:10.493 --> 32:11.712
There you go.

32:13.627 --> 32:16.412
Come on, nice and easy.

32:16.586 --> 32:18.153
Put the gun down right there.

32:18.327 --> 32:21.156
You, too, put it down, down.

32:21.330 --> 32:22.853
Kick it.

32:23.028 --> 32:24.681
Step back.

32:26.248 --> 32:28.947
- You okay, man?
- Do I freaking look okay to you?

32:32.559 --> 32:34.865
Any more shit like that,
and both of you will be dead.

32:35.040 --> 32:36.258
Do you understand me?

32:36.519 --> 32:37.999
Do you understand that,
Deputy Sugar?

32:38.173 --> 32:40.175
I understood, we don't
want any problems.

32:43.613 --> 32:46.051
The prisoners who were
dropped here off the bus,

32:46.225 --> 32:47.400
where are they?

32:49.837 --> 32:52.057
Don't you run on me, Sheriff.

32:52.231 --> 32:54.276
To the back... back door.

32:54.450 --> 32:56.104
That's good.

32:56.278 --> 32:57.801
You're gonna guide us
back there nice and easy.

32:57.976 --> 32:59.064
Then, you're gonna take us

32:59.499 --> 33:01.762
to the cell of one
they call Russell Cody.

33:01.936 --> 33:03.155
You got that?

33:03.329 --> 33:05.505
- Got it.
- Good.

33:08.943 --> 33:11.337
Nate,
bandage him up.

33:11.511 --> 33:13.078
Keep an eye on the back door.

33:19.432 --> 33:22.696
Well, those boots were made
for walking, right, Sheriff?

33:24.698 --> 33:26.047
Let's walk.

33:29.355 --> 33:30.486
You should probably
go check on your boy,

33:30.660 --> 33:31.835
don't you think, man?

33:33.402 --> 33:35.143
I'm here watching y'all.

33:35.361 --> 33:38.407
Yeah, you watching us, but we
ain't the ones getting shot at.

33:38.581 --> 33:41.323
There's a change for
your Black ass, huh?

33:41.497 --> 33:44.109
You do know
the Nazis lost the war,

33:44.283 --> 33:46.894
you White redneck, hillbilly,
inbred piece of shit?

33:47.068 --> 33:48.374
Not in here, boy.

33:48.548 --> 33:50.332
Look at all the White faces.

33:50.506 --> 33:51.551
Who the fuck you calling a boy?

33:51.725 --> 33:52.552
You.

33:52.726 --> 33:54.510
Shut the fuck up!

33:57.557 --> 33:58.688
What the hell's going
on up there, Sheriff?

33:58.862 --> 34:00.081
Put the gun down, Stamper.

34:00.255 --> 34:01.517
Where the hell is Elkins?

34:01.691 --> 34:03.215
Put the fucking gun down.

34:03.389 --> 34:04.825
Put the gun down.

34:05.782 --> 34:07.741
Put it down.

34:09.351 --> 34:11.484
Let me figure
it out for you, ace.

34:11.658 --> 34:13.399
You're outnumbered.
You're outgunned.

34:13.572 --> 34:15.053
You put it down or you don't,

34:15.531 --> 34:18.143
but there's only one outcome
that keeps you breathing.

34:21.101 --> 34:23.235
There you go, nice and easy.

34:23.409 --> 34:24.670
There you go.

34:24.975 --> 34:26.194
And that one, too.

34:27.630 --> 34:28.717
Very good, very slow.

34:28.891 --> 34:30.503
Up you get.

34:31.156 --> 34:32.940
Step back.

34:33.114 --> 34:34.637
I said step back.

34:35.029 --> 34:36.596
Hell, yeah, that's
the fuck I'm talking about.

34:36.770 --> 34:39.860
Let us out
of this cage, White brother.

34:41.340 --> 34:42.428
Hey, dawg, gimme

34:42.732 --> 34:43.777
- that gun right there.
- Hey.

34:43.951 --> 34:45.039
Pass me that right there, dawg.

34:45.213 --> 34:46.127
- I got your back.
- Hey.

34:46.301 --> 34:47.650
I got your back, dawg.

34:47.998 --> 34:49.478
You were
someone's White baby once.

34:49.652 --> 34:51.001
Hey.

34:56.005 --> 34:58.270
What the hell
you doing here, Rafe?

34:58.444 --> 35:00.402
Howdy, Cody.

35:00.576 --> 35:03.927
Didn't expect on
seeing us, now, did you?

35:07.279 --> 35:08.454
Sheriff?

35:24.513 --> 35:27.125
Me and you have got
a lot of catching up to do.

35:30.040 --> 35:31.172
Omar's getting
pretty bad out there.

35:31.346 --> 35:32.521
We got him.
Now let's go.

35:32.695 --> 35:34.001
We can help you.

35:34.393 --> 35:35.698
Hey, my man, I can stop
the bleeding for him.

35:35.872 --> 35:37.570
- We can help you.
- Nobody's going nowhere.

35:38.701 --> 35:39.963
Fuck your problem?

35:42.052 --> 35:43.750
Surveillance cameras,
where are they?

35:43.924 --> 35:46.013
- The cameras are broken.
- Don't bullshit me, Sheriff.

35:46.187 --> 35:48.102
She ain't lying.

35:48.276 --> 35:50.322
Rats ate the wire.
Kid you not.

35:50.496 --> 35:52.846
I don't care.
I wanna see for myself.

35:53.020 --> 35:54.413
He's right.
Where are they?

35:54.587 --> 35:55.979
In the storage room.

35:56.154 --> 35:57.894
Move, storage room it is.

35:58.068 --> 35:59.635
You, get the fuck in there.

35:59.809 --> 36:01.681
Go. Lock him up.

36:02.725 --> 36:03.857
Move it.

36:07.817 --> 36:10.646
Welcome to the
Lutree Hotel and Spa.

36:11.604 --> 36:14.259
Fresh meat.

36:40.894 --> 36:43.549
Oh, shit.

37:12.708 --> 37:13.796
What?

37:13.970 --> 37:15.624
Nothing, I was just thinking.

37:17.017 --> 37:18.453
About?

37:18.627 --> 37:19.889
Your face.

37:21.326 --> 37:23.197
I don't know.
We kinda look alike.

37:26.287 --> 37:28.463
Makes me think
what I coulda done.

37:28.637 --> 37:32.119
I coulda been a cop, probably
a pretty good one, too.

37:34.382 --> 37:36.036
But I guess that's what
happens when one grows up

37:36.210 --> 37:39.822
in a good family, reassurance,
a little confidence.

37:42.260 --> 37:44.044
You're gonna blame
your upbringing?

37:44.218 --> 37:45.480
Heard that one before.

37:46.786 --> 37:48.004
What, you got daddy issues?

37:51.356 --> 37:54.402
You have no idea
how my daddy broke my heart.

37:54.576 --> 37:56.361
But someone like you
wouldn't understand that now,

37:56.535 --> 37:57.797
would you?

37:58.972 --> 38:02.410
You have absolutely no idea
what I'm capable of,

38:02.584 --> 38:04.325
so you better shut
your fucking mouth

38:04.499 --> 38:06.109
before it gets you into trouble.

38:07.633 --> 38:09.199
You don't have to do this.

38:09.374 --> 38:11.332
Yeah, sorry, babe.

38:11.506 --> 38:13.421
Rafe ain't leaving here
until he gets what he wants.

38:13.595 --> 38:16.032
And when he does,
I'm walking outta here.

38:16.206 --> 38:18.296
Move the fuck.
Let's go.

38:19.427 --> 38:21.081
<i>I know what you guys
are doing here, Rafe.</i>

38:21.255 --> 38:22.822
<i>It's not gonna work.</i>

38:22.996 --> 38:25.607
You should get outta here
while you still can.

38:25.781 --> 38:27.740
What... What I had planned?

38:29.524 --> 38:32.353
Well, you know exactly
what I'm doing here,

38:32.527 --> 38:35.356
and that sounds like
a threat to me, Cody.

38:35.530 --> 38:39.621
Think of it however you want,
but look outside...

38:39.795 --> 38:41.362
it's not me you should
be worried about.

38:41.536 --> 38:44.931
But you see, it is you
I'm worried about.

38:45.105 --> 38:46.541
We come all this way,
and we went through all this

38:46.715 --> 38:47.977
to break you outta here,

38:48.326 --> 38:50.284
and that's exactly
what we're gonna do.

38:57.509 --> 38:58.814
Elkins is dead?

39:00.468 --> 39:02.165
Sorry.

39:02.340 --> 39:04.559
I know it ain't easy
losing one of your own.

39:07.736 --> 39:08.868
We gotta do something.

39:34.981 --> 39:37.113
What the hell?

39:37.287 --> 39:39.420
Somebody needs to get
a damn plumber in here.

39:39.594 --> 39:40.508
Shit.

39:40.682 --> 39:42.597
Okay, let's go, move.

39:42.771 --> 39:44.207
You seriously wanna go there?

39:44.382 --> 39:45.774
Yeah.

39:45.948 --> 39:47.733
Looks like Atlantis in here.

39:50.518 --> 39:51.519
Come on, let's go.

39:51.693 --> 39:53.347
- Wait. Look.
- Move.

39:53.521 --> 39:55.218
See those wires?

39:55.393 --> 39:56.829
It's a surveillance camera.

39:58.178 --> 39:59.919
Clearly, it's not working.

40:01.660 --> 40:02.878
Whose jacket is that?

40:04.532 --> 40:05.707
It's mine.

40:08.928 --> 40:10.190
All right, let's go.

40:11.800 --> 40:12.801
Wait.

40:14.324 --> 40:15.500
Do you see that?

40:15.935 --> 40:16.849
- What?
- Flashlight.

40:17.023 --> 40:19.025
So?

40:19.199 --> 40:20.418
So, we need to go check it out.

40:20.592 --> 40:22.811
Oh, now you wanna go down there.

40:22.985 --> 40:25.335
You wanna have a wet
T-shirt contest, too?

40:26.293 --> 40:28.600
I'm not gonna do anything.
I just need to check it.

40:28.774 --> 40:30.123
Okay, well don't try
anything funny.

40:30.340 --> 40:31.864
- I'm right behind your ass.
- I'm not.

40:43.658 --> 40:45.268
- You hear that?
- What?

40:47.532 --> 40:49.011
I don't hear anything.

41:05.027 --> 41:06.376
Holy fuck.

41:13.819 --> 41:16.604
Jesus fucking Christ.

41:33.708 --> 41:35.101
Stop shooting.

41:35.493 --> 41:37.495
The tank... the tank, stop.

42:25.586 --> 42:26.979
Oh, shit.

43:00.708 --> 43:02.536
That ain't gonna work in here.

43:03.755 --> 43:05.017
Ain't no service.

43:12.590 --> 43:13.982
Keep an eye on him.

43:19.466 --> 43:21.947
This could be
our chance right here.

43:22.121 --> 43:23.688
Chance for what?

43:23.862 --> 43:25.167
We're locked in here.

45:12.492 --> 45:13.711
Where's Carter?

45:15.669 --> 45:16.844
In there.

45:19.194 --> 45:20.587
Alligators?

45:22.850 --> 45:23.938
How'd you know?

45:30.249 --> 45:31.380
Shit.

46:02.672 --> 46:04.457
Hey, boss, please
don't leave us in here

46:04.631 --> 46:06.067
to drown with the pigs.

46:06.502 --> 46:07.895
If it was up to me,
I wouldn't be here right now.

46:08.069 --> 46:09.418
Me neither, bruh.
Please let us out.

46:09.592 --> 46:11.681
We gotta do something.

46:18.514 --> 46:19.689
Open the door.

46:33.051 --> 46:36.097
- Open the fucking door!
- Where's Rafe?

46:41.102 --> 46:42.451
Open!

46:45.541 --> 46:47.239
Open the door.

46:47.413 --> 46:49.763
What the hell's
going on out there?

46:56.248 --> 46:59.120
Goddamn, man!
Hey, close that door!

47:04.778 --> 47:06.824
Fuck!

47:21.142 --> 47:23.623
Fuck, don't let me go!

47:23.797 --> 47:25.755
Close the fucking door!

47:29.977 --> 47:31.196
Don't you let me go!

47:31.370 --> 47:32.893
No!

47:37.593 --> 47:39.682
Close the fucking door now!

47:59.441 --> 48:00.790
Oh, shit.

48:00.965 --> 48:02.792
- Back up!
- All right.

48:07.449 --> 48:08.973
Back up!

48:09.712 --> 48:11.323
Better do
what he says, Sheriff.

48:13.803 --> 48:15.283
What are you doing?

48:15.457 --> 48:16.894
I kill her...

48:18.460 --> 48:20.288
we kill them.

48:20.462 --> 48:21.681
Oh-oh.

48:26.642 --> 48:28.079
No witnesses.

48:31.996 --> 48:34.259
Oh, man. Oh!

48:34.433 --> 48:35.956
Damn, you gonna hurt
a lady, huh?

48:36.130 --> 48:38.089
Hey, get your
hands off her, man.

48:39.829 --> 48:41.222
Oh, shit!

48:42.789 --> 48:44.182
Get him!

48:44.356 --> 48:46.097
- Get off her, man!
- Oh!

48:50.449 --> 48:52.842
- Yeah, kick his ass!
- Woo!

48:53.017 --> 48:53.974
Kick his ass!

48:54.148 --> 48:56.194
Oh, shit!

48:57.108 --> 48:58.674
Yeah, ooh!

49:03.462 --> 49:04.637
Oh, shit!

49:04.942 --> 49:06.639
Never seen
a fight like that there.

49:06.813 --> 49:08.336
Just stay right there, sweetheart.

49:08.510 --> 49:09.511
I'll be right with you.

49:09.685 --> 49:12.993
Boys, boys, take a minute.

49:13.167 --> 49:15.778
I'll be done with her
real quick, at least I hope so.

49:15.953 --> 49:17.476
So just chill-out.

49:18.694 --> 49:20.348
Oh, wow, look at you.

49:20.522 --> 49:22.263
You ready to start our
little dance, sweetheart?

49:22.437 --> 49:24.352
Are you ready?

49:29.140 --> 49:30.750
Oh, my gosh, lady.

49:32.839 --> 49:36.451
Listen, I'm sorry to hit you,
lady. I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

49:36.625 --> 49:39.237
I told my mama I wasn't
gonna hit no more girls,

49:39.411 --> 49:40.673
'cause you were too pretty.

49:40.847 --> 49:42.544
Oh, what do you got there?

49:42.718 --> 49:44.416
Oh, I knew she was kinky.

49:44.590 --> 49:46.418
Let's dance.

49:46.592 --> 49:48.289
Go on now, girl, I got you.

50:15.229 --> 50:17.927
I'm gonna put a bullet
right in their fucking head!

50:18.102 --> 50:20.321
You drop them,
I'm gonna drop you.

50:20.495 --> 50:23.585
It'll make the whole world
a lot safer.

50:24.586 --> 50:26.588
Why are you doing this, man?
I thought you were with us.

50:27.981 --> 50:29.678
I was never with you.

50:37.686 --> 50:41.429
Nate, lower your gun.

50:41.603 --> 50:44.476
We got a bigger problem
we have to deal with right now.

50:44.650 --> 50:46.434
Yeah, like how the fuck
a crocodile get in here?

50:46.608 --> 50:48.654
That wasn't
no crocodile, brother.

50:48.828 --> 50:51.613
This is Louisiana,
that was a gator.

50:56.314 --> 50:59.447
Crocodiles are greener.

50:59.621 --> 51:01.754
Yeah, well how the fuck
a big-ass gator get in here?

51:05.497 --> 51:06.715
Lower your weapons.

51:08.065 --> 51:10.458
Look, I'll give
you what you want.

51:10.632 --> 51:12.330
That's why you came here, right?

51:12.504 --> 51:14.419
I never even wanted to be here.

51:18.249 --> 51:20.512
Now, things back
the way they should be.

51:21.556 --> 51:22.557
Get back.

51:22.731 --> 51:24.081
I told you, get back!

51:26.866 --> 51:29.129
Sheriff, can you please
tell me how a alligator

51:29.303 --> 51:31.436
got in your goddamn
police station?

51:31.610 --> 51:33.786
- He's not alone.
- What?

51:33.960 --> 51:34.874
You're shitting me.

51:35.048 --> 51:36.919
There's at least four.

51:37.094 --> 51:39.400
Two got Carter in
the storage room,

51:39.574 --> 51:42.447
and another two out here
got pretty boy.

51:42.621 --> 51:43.839
Omar?

51:44.013 --> 51:45.493
What's left of him.

51:46.146 --> 51:47.321
Shit.

51:49.497 --> 51:50.977
Storm brought 'em in.

51:52.283 --> 51:54.720
After Hurricane Ida,

51:54.894 --> 51:56.287
my sister's husband got eaten

51:56.548 --> 51:58.463
right in front of her
in the front lawn.

51:59.420 --> 52:03.076
It was two weeks before they
found what was left of him,

52:03.250 --> 52:06.688
inside of a 500-pound
gator's belly.

52:06.862 --> 52:10.823
Storm like Ida,
and this one right here,

52:10.997 --> 52:12.477
don't just displace people.

52:12.651 --> 52:14.870
Yeah.

52:15.044 --> 52:16.481
Push all kinds of
gators and wildlife

52:16.655 --> 52:19.179
into buildings, just like this.

52:19.353 --> 52:22.530
And they get desperate,
just like us.

52:22.704 --> 52:26.273
Yeah, we're up to our assholes
in alligators.

52:31.409 --> 52:33.672
- Jesus.
- This motherfucker.

52:33.846 --> 52:35.021
Too soon?

52:35.195 --> 52:36.805
We've got a real situation here.

52:36.979 --> 52:38.981
Who the hell put you
in charge, inmate?

52:39.156 --> 52:40.505
Nobody.

52:40.679 --> 52:42.289
He's all right.

52:42.463 --> 52:45.249
He ain't all right,
he's a goddamn cop killer.

52:45.423 --> 52:48.034
Been watching him
this whole time, trust him.

52:48.208 --> 52:50.428
For the last
15 fucking minutes?

52:50.602 --> 52:51.951
Yes, sir.

52:52.343 --> 52:53.518
Famous last words,
Deputy Dipshit.

52:53.692 --> 52:55.389
We gotta get outta here.

52:55.563 --> 52:57.043
Where are you gonna go?
The whole town's flooded.

52:57.217 --> 52:59.045
It's dangerous outside,
there's nowhere to go.

52:59.219 --> 53:00.960
Omar, Rafe, and Carter are dead.

53:01.134 --> 53:02.614
We just gotta get
the fuck outta here.

53:02.788 --> 53:04.137
Yeah, and how're
you gonna do that?

53:04.311 --> 53:05.878
We have jet skis
outside waiting.

53:06.052 --> 53:07.836
Oh, that's what's up, man.
Let's go get 'em.

53:08.010 --> 53:09.360
Just two!

53:09.751 --> 53:12.406
I hate to piss on
everybody's birthday cake,

53:14.626 --> 53:16.062
but maybe you forgetting

53:16.367 --> 53:18.195
about what happened to
his boss right there.

53:19.674 --> 53:21.067
I ain't going out that door

53:21.241 --> 53:23.417
with a big fucking
gator out there.

53:23.591 --> 53:25.724
I ain't afraid of no
fucking alligator.

53:25.898 --> 53:27.639
Well, you should be.

53:27.813 --> 53:30.772
It don't matter how big,
or how strong you are.

53:30.946 --> 53:33.514
Those things out there
been eating shit

53:33.688 --> 53:37.605
bigger than you and me
since the dinosaurs was here.

53:37.779 --> 53:39.781
And I've been tangling with
'em out there in the swamps

53:39.955 --> 53:42.131
since I was knee-high
to a crawfish.

53:42.306 --> 53:47.224
Shit, this whole station could
be infested with 'em by now.

53:47.398 --> 53:49.226
We gotta get outta here.
This whole place is flooded.

53:49.400 --> 53:50.401
We're gonna be swimming soon.

53:50.575 --> 53:51.967
Man, fuck this shit, dawg.

53:52.141 --> 53:53.578
We deep in gator shit.

53:53.882 --> 53:55.493
People from the ghetto
ain't supposed to die like this.

53:55.667 --> 53:56.929
So what's the plan, Sheriff?

53:57.103 --> 53:59.497
- We're gonna go up.
- Up where?

53:59.671 --> 54:01.063
There's two other levels.

54:01.368 --> 54:02.413
We're gonna go to the top
and sit it out.

54:02.587 --> 54:03.544
Those other levels ain't safe.

54:03.718 --> 54:04.893
You got a better idea?

54:05.067 --> 54:06.547
You're the sheriff, Sheriff.

54:08.636 --> 54:12.118
Any one of you geniuses

54:12.292 --> 54:14.381
wanna tell me how
we're getting up there?

54:14.555 --> 54:15.730
If you want to
survive the night,

54:16.078 --> 54:17.384
we're gonna have to
find a way to get along.

54:17.558 --> 54:19.995
As unpleasant as that might be.

54:23.172 --> 54:24.739
Man, fuck this.

54:25.784 --> 54:27.307
You wish.

54:27.481 --> 54:28.787
Yeah, I ain't working
with these assholes.

54:28.961 --> 54:31.442
Well, it's time to
make a decision.

55:44.166 --> 55:45.385
All right, we're good.

55:58.093 --> 55:59.965
- Okay.
- Okay.

56:00.139 --> 56:01.358
All right.

56:02.533 --> 56:04.230
All right, let's go.

56:10.541 --> 56:12.673
I don't wanna be last.

56:12.847 --> 56:15.372
Man, that thing
high up there, man.

56:27.471 --> 56:28.646
He's right.

56:40.440 --> 56:42.137
- All right.
- Let's go.

56:43.008 --> 56:44.401
You heard her.

56:45.576 --> 56:47.142
This is bullshit.

56:48.448 --> 56:51.190
Get your Sasquatch ass
up there, man.

56:51.364 --> 56:52.713
Fuck you, Thug Life.

56:52.887 --> 56:55.412
Knock it off, let's go!

56:55.586 --> 56:57.283
I'll race you to them jet skis.

56:57.457 --> 56:58.632
Bet.

57:09.382 --> 57:10.339
Move, move, move, move, move!

57:10.601 --> 57:11.645
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

57:24.876 --> 57:26.704
Come on, climb, motherfucker!

57:30.142 --> 57:32.623
Come on now, I made it
up here, so can you!

57:49.944 --> 57:51.642
All right, hurry up, let's go!

57:53.078 --> 57:54.296
Jox, you're up next.

57:54.471 --> 57:55.384
Get your ass up there.

57:55.559 --> 57:56.864
All right, man.

57:57.169 --> 57:58.387
- I'm coming right up.
- What the fuck?

57:58.562 --> 58:00.172
I can't go up?

58:00.346 --> 58:02.348
I'm sick and tired
of being gator bait

58:02.522 --> 58:04.089
down here in this motherfucker.

58:04.437 --> 58:06.657
You got the goddamn mark
of the beast on your forehead.

58:06.831 --> 58:09.355
Are you fucking serious?

58:09.529 --> 58:11.488
This is discrimination.

58:12.489 --> 58:14.621
Discrimination, my ass.

58:14.795 --> 58:16.231
Tell it to the judge.

58:18.843 --> 58:20.758
What are you waiting for?

58:20.932 --> 58:22.281
Hey, man, I was thinking,

58:22.455 --> 58:24.239
why don't you go up there first?

58:24.413 --> 58:25.763
I don't quite trust that weight.

58:25.937 --> 58:28.243
I'll hold it down down here.

58:28.417 --> 58:30.637
I'll show you
how it's done. Goddamn.

58:47.872 --> 58:49.177
Yeah.

58:49.351 --> 58:50.875
Goddamn.

59:03.496 --> 59:05.019
Let's go, let's go!

59:05.846 --> 59:09.415
Yeah, I'm okay, I just got this
little thing with heights.

59:27.868 --> 59:29.217
Anybody but me curious

59:29.522 --> 59:31.045
about how that door
got open down there?

59:40.707 --> 59:42.840
- Everyone, out!
- Hold on, what?

59:43.014 --> 59:44.624
The door behind you!

59:46.278 --> 59:48.672
- Hurry, hurry, hurry!
- Damn!

59:51.370 --> 59:53.502
No, no, the splashing draws 'em!

59:59.900 --> 01:00:01.380
Come on, man!

01:00:05.602 --> 01:00:07.299
Let's go, let's go!

01:00:10.781 --> 01:00:12.696
Get up there, Nate.

01:00:12.870 --> 01:00:14.001
Get up there, Nate.

01:00:14.175 --> 01:00:16.917
Go, go, go, move, move, move!

01:00:17.091 --> 01:00:18.658
Take this.

01:00:18.832 --> 01:00:20.051
- Up here, now!
- Come on, man!

01:00:20.225 --> 01:00:21.748
Hurry, hurry, hurry, let's go!

01:00:23.315 --> 01:00:24.708
Oh, fuck!

01:00:36.763 --> 01:00:38.504
- Come up!
- Come on, man!

01:00:38.678 --> 01:00:41.202
Floyd, move, move, move!

01:00:58.306 --> 01:00:59.525
Help me, brother.

01:00:59.699 --> 01:01:02.876
Give me your hand, please!

01:01:03.747 --> 01:01:05.662
Give me your hand, I need help.

01:01:06.750 --> 01:01:08.142
You need some help?

01:01:08.316 --> 01:01:10.884
Yes, please!

01:01:15.672 --> 01:01:16.890
Thanks.

01:01:17.369 --> 01:01:19.763
Thanks. Help me, man,
I don't wanna die here.

01:01:19.937 --> 01:01:21.155
I've got you.

01:01:21.329 --> 01:01:23.070
Okay.

01:01:23.244 --> 01:01:24.681
Yeah.

01:01:41.654 --> 01:01:43.830
Oh, fuck. Oh, goddamn it.

01:01:50.402 --> 01:01:51.882
Oh, fuck.

01:01:54.536 --> 01:01:56.277
Move, move, move!

01:01:56.451 --> 01:01:57.975
Hang on, move!

01:02:56.294 --> 01:02:59.210
Lord have mercy, did you
see the size of that thing?

01:02:59.384 --> 01:03:01.690
That was one big son of a bitch.

01:03:04.650 --> 01:03:06.260
Not bad there, Deputy.

01:03:07.435 --> 01:03:10.177
I hear they taste like chicken.

01:03:11.265 --> 01:03:12.440
I never heard that.

01:03:16.836 --> 01:03:19.230
Got you!

01:03:19.883 --> 01:03:21.188
Fuck!

01:03:22.624 --> 01:03:25.584
- Goddamn!
- Gators, man.

01:03:25.758 --> 01:03:28.195
We're all gonna get
fucking eaten alive.

01:03:41.774 --> 01:03:43.036
It's not your fault.

01:03:55.570 --> 01:03:56.920
Let's keep moving.

01:04:35.306 --> 01:04:38.091
Wait, wait, I think
we can get through here.

01:04:44.010 --> 01:04:45.403
All right, let's go.

01:05:06.728 --> 01:05:09.166
I'mma sue the shit outta
the state for mistreatment.

01:05:09.340 --> 01:05:10.471
Good luck with that.

01:05:10.645 --> 01:05:13.300
Motherfucking bugs, no food,

01:05:13.474 --> 01:05:15.215
no water we can actually drink,

01:05:15.389 --> 01:05:17.261
and now we got
man-eating gators.

01:05:17.435 --> 01:05:20.742
And if y'all didn't know, niggas
and gators don't get along.

01:05:20.917 --> 01:05:23.136
At least we know
how the water's getting in.

01:05:23.310 --> 01:05:25.008
There's so many leaks
in this ceiling.

01:05:25.182 --> 01:05:27.184
This whole place
is like a house of cards.

01:05:27.358 --> 01:05:28.663
That's just great.

01:05:28.925 --> 01:05:31.231
This day just gets
better and better.

01:05:31.405 --> 01:05:32.841
Okay, guys, you know what?

01:05:33.016 --> 01:05:35.670
Just wait here a second,
I need to think.

01:05:37.498 --> 01:05:38.891
I don't know about you fuckers,

01:05:39.065 --> 01:05:40.327
but I'm breaking myself
out of this bitch

01:05:40.501 --> 01:05:41.807
as soon as I get the chance.

01:05:41.981 --> 01:05:42.939
Oh, yeah?

01:05:43.113 --> 01:05:44.723
You bet your ass.

01:05:45.028 --> 01:05:47.682
All we gotta do is take out
these two bitches, and we gone.

01:05:47.856 --> 01:05:49.641
Ghosts.

01:05:49.815 --> 01:05:51.643
How many rounds do you got left?

01:05:51.817 --> 01:05:53.123
I got two in the shotgun,

01:05:53.471 --> 01:05:55.212
and I got nine, maybe
ten in the sidearm.

01:05:56.561 --> 01:05:57.736
Okay.

01:05:59.433 --> 01:06:02.175
I'm gonna have to go upstairs,
see what's up there.

01:06:02.349 --> 01:06:03.829
Just how exactly
do you plan

01:06:04.003 --> 01:06:05.526
on getting out of town, huh?

01:06:05.700 --> 01:06:07.398
You don't strike me
as an Olympic swimmer.

01:06:07.572 --> 01:06:10.270
Homeboy over here has got
the fucking jet skis.

01:06:10.444 --> 01:06:12.794
- If they even still there.
- Shh.

01:06:12.969 --> 01:06:15.145
In case you ain't forgot,
there's a storm raging outside.

01:06:15.319 --> 01:06:17.234
They'll be there.

01:06:17.408 --> 01:06:18.931
Forgive me if I don't
share your enthusiasm,

01:06:19.105 --> 01:06:21.499
but this little
shit stain of a town

01:06:21.673 --> 01:06:24.937
gonna be crawling with police
once the storm pass.

01:06:25.111 --> 01:06:26.983
Nah, sorry hoss.

01:06:27.157 --> 01:06:28.462
That's a fool's errand.

01:06:28.636 --> 01:06:30.551
You're the only fool that I see.

01:06:30.725 --> 01:06:32.379
Everyone here is
looking at hard time,

01:06:32.553 --> 01:06:33.815
and I ain't going.

01:06:33.990 --> 01:06:35.600
What about you, Thug Life?

01:06:35.774 --> 01:06:38.559
I'm with you, big guy.
I fuckin' hate jail.

01:06:38.733 --> 01:06:41.345
I think that's
the point, friend.

01:06:41.519 --> 01:06:44.174
Sheriff said you killed
someone, is that true?

01:06:44.348 --> 01:06:46.915
Why, you writing a book?

01:06:47.090 --> 01:06:49.135
Mm, just curious.

01:06:49.309 --> 01:06:51.181
Caught my old lady in bed
with another dude.

01:06:51.355 --> 01:06:52.356
So you shot him?

01:06:52.530 --> 01:06:55.185
Not him... her.

01:06:55.359 --> 01:06:57.404
That's no way to treat a lady.

01:06:58.797 --> 01:07:00.755
Listen to you, cop killer.

01:07:02.366 --> 01:07:05.064
She ain't ever gonna
love you, cop killer.

01:07:06.239 --> 01:07:08.372
All right, Cody, Jox,
upstairs with me, let's go.

01:07:08.546 --> 01:07:10.026
What we going up there for?

01:07:12.245 --> 01:07:14.639
We need to check
things out, let's go.

01:07:14.813 --> 01:07:17.468
Rest of you dick holes
are staying here with me.

01:07:17.642 --> 01:07:19.165
Lucky us.

01:07:20.645 --> 01:07:22.647
How do alligators
even get upstairs?

01:07:22.821 --> 01:07:24.040
Gators can climb.

01:07:24.214 --> 01:07:26.042
- No shit?
- No shit.

01:08:04.515 --> 01:08:06.473
Watch your step.

01:08:06.647 --> 01:08:08.954
Goddamn, it's musty
as shit up here,

01:08:09.128 --> 01:08:10.782
and cold as a motherfucker.

01:08:10.956 --> 01:08:12.392
I'll call the concierge.

01:08:12.566 --> 01:08:14.351
You gotta do something.

01:08:14.525 --> 01:08:18.180
No one's been up here
for years, including me.

01:08:18.354 --> 01:08:21.227
What the hell we
'posed to find up here, lady?

01:08:22.576 --> 01:08:24.491
I don't know,
find a weapon or something.

01:08:24.665 --> 01:08:26.841
Now, I like that,
I can do that.

01:09:23.420 --> 01:09:25.595
Ain't found
no weapons yet.

01:09:25.770 --> 01:09:27.598
I'm gonna keep on looking.

01:09:28.642 --> 01:09:30.774
So what's your story?

01:09:30.948 --> 01:09:33.517
Your friends that are trying
to break you out of here?

01:09:33.691 --> 01:09:35.475
You don't seem like them,

01:09:35.649 --> 01:09:37.608
and they didn't
like you very much.

01:09:38.738 --> 01:09:41.786
Must be something important
to go through all of this.

01:09:44.397 --> 01:09:48.184
You know, I was in Afghanistan,
way back,

01:09:48.358 --> 01:09:51.229
before everyone pulled out,
that whole shit show?

01:09:53.624 --> 01:09:54.973
Got a dishonorable discharge

01:09:55.147 --> 01:09:57.845
for having an argument
with my CO.

01:10:00.021 --> 01:10:02.154
Problem with authority.

01:10:06.332 --> 01:10:09.379
He gave me an order that
I didn't sign up for.

01:10:11.076 --> 01:10:14.340
Unfortunately, our argument
got a little physical.

01:10:14.514 --> 01:10:15.863
Oh, yeah,
that's a big mistake.

01:10:16.212 --> 01:10:17.865
When I got back,
I couldn't get a job.

01:10:18.214 --> 01:10:20.303
Turns out, there's not much
work for a disgraced soldier.

01:10:22.914 --> 01:10:26.134
Yeah, but I still don't get
the cop-killer thing.

01:10:29.747 --> 01:10:31.836
Did whatever I could
to make money.

01:10:33.577 --> 01:10:36.536
I became a driver,
delivering packages

01:10:36.710 --> 01:10:41.062
for certain types of people,
that kind of thing.

01:10:41.237 --> 01:10:43.848
One day, I delivered
this package to Rafe.

01:10:44.022 --> 01:10:45.458
He and I got to talking.

01:10:45.632 --> 01:10:48.679
Turns out, he and his gang,

01:10:48.853 --> 01:10:51.377
all ex-military,
similar stories to mine.

01:10:52.509 --> 01:10:56.252
He offers me $20,000 to be
getaway driver for this job

01:10:56.426 --> 01:10:59.646
where he guaranteed that
no one would get hurt, no one.

01:11:00.778 --> 01:11:02.562
Got to them throwing
these huge bags of money

01:11:02.736 --> 01:11:04.912
in the backseat of that car,
but before they got in,

01:11:05.086 --> 01:11:07.045
cops showed up
and Rafe turns on a dime,

01:11:07.219 --> 01:11:10.918
and shoots the first cop
six times, dead to center.

01:11:11.092 --> 01:11:12.790
Rest of his gang
take out the other two,

01:11:13.051 --> 01:11:15.836
and before they get in,
I hit the pedal to the floor.

01:11:18.230 --> 01:11:19.927
So you drove off with the money?

01:11:23.235 --> 01:11:26.499
I sat there
and debated for a while.

01:11:26.673 --> 01:11:28.545
I stashed the money,
went to the rendezvous point

01:11:28.719 --> 01:11:31.591
where we were supposed to
meet up if we got separated,

01:11:31.765 --> 01:11:33.289
only they weren't there.

01:11:33.550 --> 01:11:37.293
Somehow the cops showed up,
and I got busted,

01:11:37.467 --> 01:11:39.947
and Rafe and them all got away.

01:11:44.735 --> 01:11:45.736
But you did the crime.

01:11:45.910 --> 01:11:47.303
Now I'm doing the time.

01:12:09.803 --> 01:12:12.502
"High performance
protective coatings."

01:12:12.676 --> 01:12:14.460
I oughta use this
as lubrication.

01:12:18.682 --> 01:12:21.424
I'm not a good man, far from it.

01:12:22.686 --> 01:12:24.035
It's the biggest mistake
I've made

01:12:24.209 --> 01:12:26.603
in a long list of mistakes.

01:12:26.777 --> 01:12:29.040
But I like to think
that you're right.

01:12:31.085 --> 01:12:32.348
About what?

01:12:34.437 --> 01:12:35.742
That I'm not like them.

01:12:56.763 --> 01:12:57.938
Fuck me.

01:13:00.767 --> 01:13:01.942
Shoot him.

01:13:02.116 --> 01:13:03.596
Wait.

01:13:05.337 --> 01:13:06.512
Hold.

01:13:08.166 --> 01:13:11.430
Wait, grab my gun.
Grab it.

01:13:18.742 --> 01:13:20.221
Shoot!

01:13:32.146 --> 01:13:33.887
- Reloading.
- Shoot this motherfucker!

01:13:35.367 --> 01:13:37.282
Goddamn!
Shoot this motherfucker, please.

01:13:37.456 --> 01:13:38.762
Dear God!

01:13:48.119 --> 01:13:49.773
Cover me.

01:13:59.391 --> 01:14:00.523
Shoot this motherfucker!

01:14:00.697 --> 01:14:02.525
He's killing me!

01:14:02.699 --> 01:14:05.397
Shoot this motherfucker,
please. I got a family!

01:14:12.578 --> 01:14:14.188
Get down!

01:14:15.581 --> 01:14:17.017
Wait, no!

01:15:06.850 --> 01:15:08.155
Whoo!

01:15:15.467 --> 01:15:16.729
Right there!

01:15:18.035 --> 01:15:18.949
No!

01:15:33.050 --> 01:15:35.400
Jet skis, let's go.

01:15:36.749 --> 01:15:39.099
You fucked up, Jim.

01:15:50.284 --> 01:15:51.590
Let's fucking go!

01:15:51.764 --> 01:15:52.939
Okay.

01:16:35.373 --> 01:16:36.592
Go on now.

01:16:37.810 --> 01:16:39.595
Let Big Jim take care of this.

01:16:45.818 --> 01:16:47.298
Hey there, beauty.

01:16:47.472 --> 01:16:48.778
You's a big one, ain't ya?

01:16:50.083 --> 01:16:51.171
Come on, now.

01:16:55.698 --> 01:16:57.134
Big Jim got something for ya.

01:16:58.222 --> 01:17:00.790
Yeah, come on now.

01:17:17.807 --> 01:17:18.982
Get outta here!

01:17:19.156 --> 01:17:20.766
Let me handle this.

01:17:24.640 --> 01:17:26.642
You didn't like that, did ya?

01:17:26.816 --> 01:17:30.036
Well, Big Jim got
something for ya.

01:18:05.419 --> 01:18:06.725
Oh!

01:18:27.485 --> 01:18:28.878
Let's go.

01:18:56.253 --> 01:18:58.734
This one thought I was dead,
and was saving me for later.

01:18:58.908 --> 01:19:01.780
Now I'm gonna make
boots out of him.

01:19:01.954 --> 01:19:03.347
Can't believe
I'm gonna say this, Rafe,

01:19:03.521 --> 01:19:06.480
but I'm really glad to see you.

01:19:06.654 --> 01:19:09.614
Protecting my investment.

01:19:09.788 --> 01:19:11.311
We've gotta move.
We've gotta get to the jet skis

01:19:11.485 --> 01:19:12.965
if we're gonna
make it outta here.

01:19:13.139 --> 01:19:15.663
You guys go,
I'll be right behind you.

01:19:15.838 --> 01:19:17.274
No, we're not leaving you.

01:19:17.448 --> 01:19:19.798
Trust me, I've got a plan.

01:19:28.851 --> 01:19:31.027
You've got one shot, Sheriff.

01:20:43.839 --> 01:20:46.624
Hey. Here.

01:20:46.798 --> 01:20:50.149
We fucking did it, we did it.

01:20:50.889 --> 01:20:52.543
Let's go.

01:20:52.717 --> 01:20:54.023
What?

01:20:54.980 --> 01:20:56.416
What do you mean, what?

01:20:56.590 --> 01:20:58.592
Okay. I've got the fucking keys,
man, let's go.

01:20:58.766 --> 01:21:00.159
We did it.

01:21:01.334 --> 01:21:03.206
I'm not leaving her.

01:21:03.380 --> 01:21:05.077
What did you say?

01:21:05.251 --> 01:21:06.644
Maybe you're not
thinking straight.

01:21:06.818 --> 01:21:08.994
I've got the keys,
we're leaving her,

01:21:09.168 --> 01:21:10.561
and we're going right now.

01:21:13.825 --> 01:21:16.001
Are you out of
your fucking mind?

01:21:21.964 --> 01:21:24.357
I said, I'm not leaving her.

01:21:24.531 --> 01:21:26.316
Who said I'm leaving her?

01:21:26.490 --> 01:21:27.883
I'm gonna kill her.

01:21:54.170 --> 01:21:55.606
We have no choice.

01:21:56.781 --> 01:21:58.565
We have no choice.

01:22:02.743 --> 01:22:04.571
I won't let you
kill another cop.

01:22:28.813 --> 01:22:30.075
Wait.

01:22:31.250 --> 01:22:32.469
Stop.

01:22:34.775 --> 01:22:36.125
Okay.

01:22:58.930 --> 01:23:01.846
Now, Cody, you know we can't.

01:23:05.850 --> 01:23:09.897
The county sheriff...
she knows what we look like.

01:23:10.072 --> 01:23:12.161
She knows who we are.

01:23:12.335 --> 01:23:14.902
You've gotta let it go,
it's over for us both.

01:23:15.903 --> 01:23:17.079
Do you get that?

01:23:20.865 --> 01:23:21.997
I won't leave her.

01:23:28.307 --> 01:23:29.874
Okay.

01:23:31.310 --> 01:23:33.399
Okay.

01:23:33.573 --> 01:23:35.749
Okay, I think you're right.

01:23:36.707 --> 01:23:38.013
We'll save the cop.

01:24:18.705 --> 01:24:19.880
Sorry, partner.

01:24:48.735 --> 01:24:51.608
Now, where are
those damn jet skis?

01:25:57.239 --> 01:25:59.241
Are you gonna lock
me back up now, huh?

01:26:02.679 --> 01:26:04.246
The way I see it...

01:26:07.379 --> 01:26:09.294
I got five dead convicts
to report.

01:26:12.079 --> 01:26:13.559
Are you serious?

01:26:13.733 --> 01:26:15.692
Guess none of you were
just badass enough

01:26:15.866 --> 01:26:18.608
to get through a dangerous
storm with man-eating reptiles.

01:26:25.658 --> 01:26:27.704
I've been meaning to
ask you something.

01:26:28.792 --> 01:26:30.228
Yeah, what's that?

01:26:33.710 --> 01:26:35.190
Your friends
who stole the money,

01:26:35.364 --> 01:26:36.800
what'd they do with it?

01:26:41.021 --> 01:26:42.980
I'll be seeing
you around, Sheriff.
