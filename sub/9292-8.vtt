00:14.200 --> 00:18.193
You helped terrorists
acquire weaponised nerve gas!

00:18.280 --> 00:22.193
We were going to trigger the canisters
once they reached central Asia.

00:22.280 --> 00:27.752
Walt, you got into bed with them and they're
threatening to use the gas on US citizens.

00:27.840 --> 00:29.159
What do we do about Walt?

00:29.240 --> 00:32.198
Keep him out of sight long enough
to construct a narrative.

00:32.280 --> 00:34.236
Are you talking about a cover-up?

00:34.320 --> 00:38.791
Walt Cummings was complicit
in David Palmer's assassination.

00:38.880 --> 00:44.398
If we go public, the credibility
of this office will be destroyed.

00:44.680 --> 00:46.875
- Mr President.
- What is it, Mike?

00:46.960 --> 00:48.678
- Come here.
- What's going on?

00:48.760 --> 00:50.876
Just come here, sir.

00:51.280 --> 00:53.396
- Lynn.
- What is it?

00:53.480 --> 00:55.835
I know you're busy, but I need to see you.

01:00.960 --> 01:05.476
I need you to do some work for us
and we need it done fast. Get the canisters.

01:05.560 --> 01:10.509
You have to cut precisely ten centimetres
from the bottom of the casing.

01:10.600 --> 01:13.751
- We need a place we can meet.
- I'll call you back.

01:14.680 --> 01:19.674
Logan asked for Jack to be reinstated
provisionally with full autonomy.

01:19.760 --> 01:22.752
We got a possible intercept on Erwich -
Jacob Rossler.

01:22.840 --> 01:26.594
<i>He's a software programmer
indicted for security code infiltration.</i>

01:26.680 --> 01:28.272
Copy that.

01:28.360 --> 01:30.112
Federal agent!

01:30.440 --> 01:33.113
Rossler is in custody.
Repeat, Rossler is in custody.

01:33.560 --> 01:35.516
<i>Answer it.</i>

01:36.000 --> 01:38.560
- Y es.
- We have the identification keys.

01:40.720 --> 01:42.711
No! No!

01:42.800 --> 01:44.597
Is he gonna make it?

01:44.680 --> 01:47.114
No. He's dead.

01:47.200 --> 01:49.839
He was our only link to those canisters.

01:49.920 --> 01:54.710
Erwich's gonna call here any minute
and he's gonna expect to talk to him.

02:20.800 --> 02:25.191
- What's the situation?
- Rossler's dead, shot by his companion.

02:25.280 --> 02:30.308
- What does that do to our plan?
- We intended him to lead us to the Sentox.

02:30.400 --> 02:32.550
- How?
- He was gonna sell Erwich a chip

02:32.640 --> 02:35.359
that would enable him to release the Sentox.

02:35.440 --> 02:40.719
- And we put a tracker on the chip?
- Yes. Obviously that plan has to change.

02:40.800 --> 02:43.268
- Has Erwich set a place for the meeting?
- No.

02:43.360 --> 02:46.193
We've also picked up chatter
related to the canisters.

02:46.280 --> 02:51.593
- Related how?
- Erwich's put out feelers to terrorists here.

02:51.680 --> 02:55.309
He's asking for help launching
nerve gas attacks on larger targets.

02:55.400 --> 02:59.313
There's a call coming in on Rossler's phone.
What do you want to do?

02:59.400 --> 03:01.595
Put it on the speaker.

03:05.200 --> 03:07.589
Jack, this has to be Erwich.

03:07.680 --> 03:11.229
- CTU's on the line.
- Ready?

03:13.880 --> 03:16.189
- Yeah.
- Five minutes.

03:16.280 --> 03:20.319
The roof of the parking garage,
the corner of White Oak and Madison.

03:20.400 --> 03:24.029
One of my men will meet you.
Look for a blue van.

03:25.600 --> 03:28.717
- What do you think?
- I think we caught a break.

03:28.800 --> 03:31.030
Give me the chip.

03:34.960 --> 03:36.075
CTU,

03:36.160 --> 03:39.630
<i>- Let me speak to Bill Buchanan.
- Jack Bauer on the line.</i>

03:39.720 --> 03:41.836
<i>- Buchanan.
- Did you get that?</i>

03:41.920 --> 03:44.673
Erwich is sending someone else.
That's a problem.

03:44.760 --> 03:50.278
No. It means I can pass myself off as Rossler.
We can keep the meeting. We can control this.

03:50.360 --> 03:52.749
Rossler and Erwich's man
may know each other.

03:52.840 --> 03:55.877
He wouldn't have said,
"Look for a blue van" if they did.

03:55.960 --> 03:59.077
- It's a big risk, Jack.
- Jack, they will probably kill you.

03:59.160 --> 04:01.549
Even if they do think you're Rossler.

04:01.640 --> 04:03.081
We don't have a choice.

04:03.162 --> 04:07.590
If we're lucky, he'll take the chip
to Erwich and lead us to the gas.

04:11.040 --> 04:14.077
- All right, Jack. Do it.
- Thank you.

04:15.440 --> 04:20.230
Chloe, Edgar, Jack will need you to support
him through the installation of the chip.

04:20.320 --> 04:24.199
- We'll pull up the schematics.
- Already on it.

04:25.320 --> 04:28.869
The chip is genuine,
but it's useless without the unlock code.

04:28.960 --> 04:32.077
- The tracker is built into the chip itself.
- OK. Thanks.

04:32.160 --> 04:36.199
- How do you wanna play this?
- I want them to think I'm scared of them.

04:36.280 --> 04:38.430
Get tac teams ready. We're on the move.

04:38.520 --> 04:43.230
You'll need a comm unit with a fresh battery.
You'll be patched into CTU at all times.

04:43.320 --> 04:46.756
We'll be able to hear everything
within a 20ft radius of you.

04:46.840 --> 04:49.832
- I'll be watching your back.
- Thanks.

04:50.640 --> 04:53.108
Testing, one, two, three.

04:53.200 --> 04:58.479
He'll be waiting for you there.
Let me know if there's a problem.

05:01.960 --> 05:04.155
- Do we have the new chip yet?
- No.

05:04.240 --> 05:06.754
I sent Polakov and Komar to meet Rossler.

05:06.840 --> 05:09.274
We should have it in a few minutes.
Anything?

05:09.360 --> 05:13.035
A remote is the most effective way
of triggering the canisters.

05:13.120 --> 05:16.157
I understand,
but what if the new chip doesn't work?

05:16.240 --> 05:18.674
I need options in case Rossler fails us.

05:18.760 --> 05:24.756
There may be a work-around, but someone
will have to be on site with the canister.

05:25.600 --> 05:27.591
Get it done.

05:32.040 --> 05:34.349
Excuse me, I thought you should know.

05:34.440 --> 05:39.719
WaIt's body has been moved to the Secret
Service outbuilding for the time being.

05:39.800 --> 05:44.237
You realise, sir, we still need to issue
a public statement about his death.

05:44.320 --> 05:48.677
- No statement till his wife's been notified.
- Of course.

05:48.760 --> 05:55.108
Sir, if you don't mind me saying,
I think perhaps we have an opportunity here.

05:55.200 --> 05:57.509
This statement you plan to release

05:57.600 --> 06:03.038
disclosing the fact that Walt was part of the
conspiracy to supply terrorists with nerve gas

06:03.120 --> 06:06.032
and that he was involved
in Palmer's assassination...

06:06.120 --> 06:08.873
- What's your point, Mike?
- I'm sorry, sir.

06:08.960 --> 06:12.953
I wonder if his death
might render all that moot.

06:17.920 --> 06:19.319
Go on.

06:19.400 --> 06:22.392
Little will come
from dragging his name through the mud

06:22.480 --> 06:24.835
when he's not here to answer for what he did.

06:24.920 --> 06:28.879
And it would be devastating for this country,
particularly if, God forbid,

06:28.960 --> 06:31.952
that nerve gas is used against us.

06:32.040 --> 06:33.837
What are you suggesting?

06:33.920 --> 06:39.153
We could attribute WaIt's suicide
to a despondency over the day's events.

06:39.240 --> 06:42.118
Overwork, personal issues.

06:42.200 --> 06:45.829
Let him go out with some dignity,
you mean, not as a traitor.

06:45.920 --> 06:47.512
Yes, sir.

06:50.640 --> 06:53.598
My wife will have
a considerable problem with that.

06:53.680 --> 06:55.591
Well...

06:55.680 --> 07:00.470
I respect the first lady's
moral conviction, but...

07:00.560 --> 07:02.596
this is your decision,

07:02.680 --> 07:04.671
not hers.

07:17.960 --> 07:22.078
- Is there anything else I can get you?
- No, thank you, Evelyn. I'm fine.

07:22.160 --> 07:26.153
- Can I ask your advice on something?
- Of course.

07:29.760 --> 07:31.910
Some of the staff are asking questions.

07:32.000 --> 07:34.434
- About?
- Walt Cummings' death.

07:34.520 --> 07:38.069
I'm preparing a statement
that the president's gonna give later.

07:38.160 --> 07:40.549
It'll explain everything.

07:42.960 --> 07:45.793
- Is there something else, Evelyn?
- Yes.

07:47.960 --> 07:49.837
What? What is it?

07:49.920 --> 07:53.117
Why did he do it? Why did Walt kill himself?

07:55.760 --> 08:00.550
I deserve to know. A violent thing happened
to someone that I work with every day,

08:00.640 --> 08:03.074
who had no visible signs of depression.

08:03.160 --> 08:07.756
What if it wasn't suicide? What if we're
in danger? I don't know what to think.

08:07.840 --> 08:11.469
- It was suicide.
- How can you be so sure?

08:14.520 --> 08:16.715
Evelyn, listen to me.

08:19.120 --> 08:23.193
What I'm going to say to you has to stay
in this room until it's made public.

08:23.280 --> 08:26.352
You do understand?
His family doesn't know the truth yet.

08:26.440 --> 08:27.953
OK.

08:28.040 --> 08:30.713
- Walt Cummings was a traitor.
- What?

08:30.800 --> 08:32.916
I'm not gonna go into any details.

08:33.000 --> 08:36.549
Walt was responsible for some of
the awful things that happened.

08:36.640 --> 08:39.552
- I can't believe that.
- The president just found out.

08:39.640 --> 08:44.316
I suppose that Walt didn't want to face
the humiliation of a long public trial

08:44.400 --> 08:46.994
and he decided to kill himself.

08:47.840 --> 08:50.513
Was he working with the terrorists?

08:50.600 --> 08:55.276
Our enforcement agencies
are trying to figure that out.

09:04.840 --> 09:09.072
- Jack's arrived at the rendezvous point.
- Maintain your distance.

09:17.640 --> 09:23.078
Heads up. We have the blue van entering
the parking garage. Licence plate 6Q49951.

09:23.160 --> 09:27.153
<i>- Repeat, 6Q49951.
- Running the plates.</i>

09:34.360 --> 09:37.670
He's heading up the ramp towards you.
Couldn't get a visual.

09:42.520 --> 09:45.034
I have a hit.
The plates don't match the vehicle.

09:45.120 --> 09:49.591
<i>They probably stole the van
and put clean plates on it.</i>

10:00.040 --> 10:02.235
Two men are getting out.

10:04.600 --> 10:06.238
Showtime.

10:09.640 --> 10:11.756
Rossler.

10:12.360 --> 10:14.635
I was told there'd only be one of you.

10:14.720 --> 10:17.951
- Is that a problem?
- Yeah. I don't like surprises.

10:18.040 --> 10:20.952
Relax. I've got your money.

10:21.840 --> 10:24.877
- Let me see it.
- When I see the chip.

10:34.520 --> 10:38.991
<i>- Erwich says you have to install it.
- Where's the remote trigger?</i>

10:39.080 --> 10:40.672
Let's go.

10:42.640 --> 10:44.631
Let's go.

10:52.680 --> 10:56.150
OK, Jack. You need to remove the backing.

11:02.880 --> 11:06.919
Inside there are five jumpers.
Toggle the one in the middle to the left,

11:07.000 --> 11:10.072
then pry out the old chip, but do it gently.

11:10.160 --> 11:13.357
When it's out, clear your throat or something.

11:20.720 --> 11:26.113
OK. Insert the new chip into the slot.
Press the reset button directly under it.

11:26.200 --> 11:28.555
Screw the back on and you're done.

11:51.440 --> 11:54.238
It's reconfigured.
You can activate the canisters.

11:54.320 --> 12:00.190
You'd better hope it works.
You're coming with us, just to make sure.

12:02.640 --> 12:04.676
What are they doing?

12:09.280 --> 12:11.475
<i>We're on the move.</i>

12:16.320 --> 12:18.675
<i>This isn't the deal I made with Erwich.</i>

12:18.760 --> 12:24.596
I reconfigured the trigger.
You're supposed to just give me the money.

12:24.680 --> 12:27.717
<i>- Standing by to move in.
- Hold on, Curtis.</i>

12:27.800 --> 12:31.031
Erwich knows who Jack is.
He saw him. They'll kill him.

12:31.120 --> 12:33.714
When Jack gets close,
the tac teams will move in.

12:33.800 --> 12:37.270
We need to move in now.
Make the terrorists tell us where Erwich is.

12:37.360 --> 12:42.150
Erwich will know something's wrong
and we'll lose him. This is our only shot.

12:42.240 --> 12:43.719
Bill!

12:55.920 --> 12:58.115
Are we letting them take Jack?

12:58.200 --> 13:03.035
Stand down. Take no action. Reassemble
the tac teams and mount a follow operation.

13:03.120 --> 13:05.588
<i>- All teams, stand by.
- Roger that.</i>

13:12.080 --> 13:16.790
Lynn's right. Whatever happens,
Jack can handle it. He has to.

13:34.600 --> 13:37.398
Come in.

13:37.480 --> 13:39.914
- Excuse me, Mrs Logan.
- What is it?

13:40.000 --> 13:43.834
- Here's the press release. I'm confused.
- About what?

13:43.920 --> 13:47.959
It's not what you said. They're calling
Walt Cummings a hero, not a traitor.

13:48.040 --> 13:50.235
I don't believe this!

13:54.160 --> 13:56.549
Well, is CTU any closer?

13:56.640 --> 14:00.076
They hope their operation
will lead them to the canisters.

14:00.160 --> 14:04.312
Hope is not good enough. We want results.
You need to make that clear to them.

14:04.400 --> 14:09.190
I believe they're doing everything
that can be done, sir.

14:10.000 --> 14:14.073
I just read the statement
you issued about WaIt's death.

14:14.160 --> 14:19.473
"Stress due to overwork robbed this country
of one of its most dedicated public servants."

14:19.560 --> 14:23.473
"His work with this administration has..."

14:23.560 --> 14:25.790
You're covering everything up.

14:25.880 --> 14:28.713
- I'll wait outside.
- Don't go anywhere, Mike.

14:28.800 --> 14:31.314
Your fingerprints are all over this.

14:31.400 --> 14:33.789
Charles, we worked on this together.

14:33.880 --> 14:39.193
I thought we agreed you needed to go public
about WaIt's involvement with everything.

14:39.280 --> 14:43.956
I know you're disappointed, but it's obvious
Walt taking his own life changes things.

14:44.040 --> 14:46.713
What's obvious is that this is a pack of lies!

14:46.800 --> 14:50.349
Mrs Logan, full disclosure
would have been necessary

14:50.440 --> 14:53.113
to ensure Walt faced justice
for what he'd done.

14:53.200 --> 14:59.514
With his death making that a non-issue, it was
decided this course was best for his family.

14:59.600 --> 15:05.232
Oh, don't. You don't care about his family.
You decided that this was best for you.

15:05.320 --> 15:08.437
- But you are dead wrong...
- Martha, that's enough!

15:08.520 --> 15:12.433
I made my decision, and I am the president.

15:12.520 --> 15:15.353
Which means it's your job to tell the truth,

15:17.360 --> 15:19.828
even when it's ugly.

15:21.160 --> 15:23.594
And if you don't, I will.

15:24.080 --> 15:26.434
If you feel so strongly
about telling the truth,

15:26.515 --> 15:28.551
start with WaIt's
wife when she arrives.

15:28.640 --> 15:31.552
- Suzanne's coming?
- To collect her husband's body.

15:31.640 --> 15:35.235
So you can tell her that the real reason
Walt took the coward's way out

15:35.320 --> 15:40.519
was because he disgraced himself
and he betrayed his country.

15:43.160 --> 15:45.720
All right.

15:45.800 --> 15:48.075
It will be very painful,

15:48.160 --> 15:50.879
but it's the right thing to do.

15:56.720 --> 16:00.349
We're one mile behind Jack, heading west
on Nordhoff, passing Sepulveda.

16:00.440 --> 16:03.876
Maintain your distance.
We've got them on satellite.

16:03.960 --> 16:07.157
<i>- Where are we going?
- What does it matter?</i>

16:07.240 --> 16:09.754
I have another appointment.

16:09.840 --> 16:13.833
We're almost there. How long it takes
once we get there is up to you.

16:13.920 --> 16:15.990
- What do you mean?
- I told you.

16:16.080 --> 16:20.596
We need to make sure the remote trigger
works on the canisters.

16:23.400 --> 16:26.312
Oh, my God.
You've got one of the canisters with you.

16:26.400 --> 16:28.311
Erwich wants a field test.

16:28.400 --> 16:31.039
I won't be within 50 miles of that
when it goes off.

16:31.120 --> 16:33.714
We have masks.

16:35.280 --> 16:38.033
What's the target?

16:41.800 --> 16:45.998
- Curtis, are you reading this?
- Do you want me to reposition for intercept?

16:46.080 --> 16:48.674
No. Not till we have a visual on the canister.

16:48.760 --> 16:54.835
If they stay on Nordhoff, up ahead there's
an industrial park and two retail complexes.

16:55.680 --> 17:00.674
- They just turned north. That's not good.
- What is it? What's the potential target?

17:00.760 --> 17:03.274
Sunrise Hills Mall.

17:20.280 --> 17:23.556
Curtis, the intended target
is the Sunrise Hills Mall.

17:23.640 --> 17:27.315
Repeat, the intended target
is the Sunrise Hills Mall.

17:27.400 --> 17:30.790
Uploading schematics of the mall
and surrounding streets now.

17:30.880 --> 17:36.113
Teams, stand by for positioning. We'll set up
on the second level of the parking structure.

17:46.160 --> 17:48.071
This is it.

17:58.280 --> 18:00.350
Curtis, do you have Jack on visual?

18:00.440 --> 18:02.954
He and the hostiles
are in the south parking lot.

18:03.040 --> 18:05.508
Alpha team, take up position at the perimeter.

18:05.600 --> 18:08.592
Bravo team,
I want plain-clothes agents at the mall doors.

18:10.760 --> 18:13.593
- How will you get the canister in?
- Through the door.

18:13.680 --> 18:17.309
Anyone asks,
we're working on the air conditioning.

18:17.400 --> 18:20.790
- I didn't agree to this. I'm not going in.
- Yes, you are.

18:21.440 --> 18:23.635
What are we waiting for?

18:23.720 --> 18:28.635
There are hundreds of video cameras in there.
This entire country'll know what we look like.

18:28.720 --> 18:30.915
We want your leaders to know who did this.

18:31.000 --> 18:33.841
That's your fight. The deal
I made was to sell the chip,

18:33.922 --> 18:35.869
not to get my face
all over the news.

18:35.960 --> 18:39.111
Erwich prefers to keep you alive,
but only if you cooperate.

18:39.200 --> 18:41.794
Now hand me the jackets.

18:43.320 --> 18:48.519
We're moving the tac teams in to recover
the canisters before you go inside the mall.

18:48.600 --> 18:51.433
Fine. Let's get this over with.

18:54.000 --> 18:56.912
<i>I'll let you know
as soon as we're in position.</i>

18:57.000 --> 19:00.834
<i>- Sending redeployment orders now.
- Hold off on that.</i>

19:00.920 --> 19:03.480
We have got to stop them
before they get inside.

19:03.560 --> 19:09.078
If we move in, Erwich will know we're onto
him. We won't be led to the other canisters.

19:10.520 --> 19:15.230
Are you talking about letting them do this?
Sacrificing the lives of all those people?

19:15.320 --> 19:19.757
I'm accepting the damage that one canister
can do versus what the other 19 can do.

19:19.840 --> 19:23.958
- This is insane. Bill.
- Bill's not in charge here. I am.

19:26.840 --> 19:29.070
We need to call the president.

19:33.680 --> 19:35.671
<i>Let's go.</i>

20:03.280 --> 20:09.276
I just got into the mall's video surveillance
server. We should be able to see Jack.

20:23.080 --> 20:26.199
Jack, we're still waiting
for the president to call.

20:26.240 --> 20:28.830
I'll let you know as
soon as we have him.

20:48.040 --> 20:51.555
Get the security guard. Knock on the glass.

21:03.600 --> 21:06.068
- What are you doing here?
- Servicing the HVAC.

21:06.160 --> 21:09.596
- We didn't get a call about that.
- I don't know what to say. We did.

21:09.680 --> 21:12.990
- You got paperwork?
- Just a minute.

21:25.160 --> 21:27.993
- Will this work?
- Yeah.

21:28.080 --> 21:31.516
Do it. Throw me the bag.

21:32.760 --> 21:34.751
And your jacket.

21:48.760 --> 21:51.069
<i>The president is on line one.</i>

21:51.160 --> 21:53.071
<i>- Put him through.
- Yes, sir.</i>

21:53.160 --> 21:55.958
Jack, the president is on the line.
I'll patch you in.

21:56.040 --> 21:58.395
<i>- Go ahead.
- This is Lynn McGill.</i>

21:58.480 --> 22:03.873
You also have Bill Buchanan, Audrey Raines,
Chloe O'Brian and Edgar Stiles in the room.

22:03.960 --> 22:06.997
We need your decision
on a critical operational matter.

22:07.080 --> 22:11.198
- What is it?
- Jack Bauer's undercover with the terrorists.

22:11.720 --> 22:15.793
They're expecting Jack to help them release
a canister of Sentox nerve gas

22:15.880 --> 22:18.872
in the Sunrise Hills shopping mall
where they are now.

22:18.960 --> 22:23.431
- Well, then, arrest them. What's the problem?
- If we don't maintain Jack's cover,

22:23.520 --> 22:28.958
there's no guarantee that they'll lead us
back to the other 19 canisters.

22:29.040 --> 22:33.556
Do you mean actually let them release
the Sentox? Are you out of your mind?

22:33.640 --> 22:37.269
Mr President, Bill Buchanan.
I had the same initial reaction.

22:37.360 --> 22:41.114
Then I looked at updated scenarios.
With the help of other terrorists,

22:41.200 --> 22:45.432
the remaining canisters could be deployed
at other, more crowded public areas

22:45.520 --> 22:49.911
such as subway stations,
hospitals and sports arenas, sir.

22:50.000 --> 22:54.915
The loss of life could exceed
hundreds of thousands of people.

22:55.000 --> 22:57.230
My God.

23:07.520 --> 23:09.954
Bring it over here.

23:12.040 --> 23:14.031
I got it.

23:15.480 --> 23:18.119
What kind of casualties
do you predict at the mall?

23:18.200 --> 23:23.638
We don't have exact numbers, but based on
our surveillance our guess is 800 or 900.

23:23.720 --> 23:26.188
Sir, many of them are children.

23:27.000 --> 23:30.595
- Can't you evacuate the mall?
- Not without the terrorists knowing.

23:30.680 --> 23:34.639
The public will not tolerate
the government's complicity in this.

23:34.720 --> 23:39.271
They wouldn't know, sir.
This would be a covert decision.

23:39.720 --> 23:43.998
<i>We're monitoring them. We know with 100%
certainty that when they leave the mall.</i>

23:44.080 --> 23:47.436
<i>they're going back to the remaining canisters.</i>

23:53.800 --> 23:56.598
- What's your recommendation?
- Bill and I agree.

23:56.680 --> 24:01.993
The greatest good would be served by
allowing them to release this single canister.

24:02.080 --> 24:05.914
I believe that we have no right
to sanction the deaths of innocent people.

24:06.000 --> 24:11.711
We should take our chances, interrogate them
and find the location of the other canisters.

24:15.480 --> 24:17.948
<i>- Are we ready?
- Almost.</i>

24:21.200 --> 24:25.512
Mr President, we're running out of time.
We need your decision, sir.

24:25.600 --> 24:27.795
This is a field operation. It's up to you.

24:27.880 --> 24:30.633
With all due respect, Mr President, it's not.

24:30.720 --> 24:35.271
We don't have the legal authority
to make this decision. Only you do.

24:37.600 --> 24:41.798
You're putting me in a terrible position.
Hold on.

24:43.160 --> 24:44.752
Mike.

24:45.640 --> 24:48.632
CTU has laid out the facts well,

24:48.720 --> 24:51.837
but you have to make the call.

24:58.240 --> 25:02.313
All right. The terrorists are forcing us
to make a tragic choice.

25:03.760 --> 25:06.752
I'll go along with your assessment.
Let them release it.

25:06.840 --> 25:11.914
But you'd better find those other canisters,
or those people will have died in vain.

25:15.360 --> 25:20.434
Pull our tac teams out of the mall.
Jack, you heard the president's decision.

25:20.880 --> 25:23.440
<i>- Let's go.
- Put your masks on.</i>

25:26.800 --> 25:29.268
I'm going to arm the valve.

25:31.920 --> 25:34.275
What's the unlock code?

25:34.360 --> 25:37.636
Jack, the unlock code is Alpha, Kilo, Charlie.

25:38.160 --> 25:41.118
I repeat, Alpha, Kilo, Charlie.

25:41.840 --> 25:44.593
Come on! What's the unlock code?

25:44.680 --> 25:48.116
<i>Alpha, Kilo, Charlie, Jack.</i>

25:48.200 --> 25:50.316
Echo, Bravo, Charlie.

25:56.400 --> 26:00.552
<i>Enter the correct code, Jack.
That's an order.</i>

26:00.640 --> 26:03.359
Jack, this is a direct
order from the president.

26:03.440 --> 26:06.989
Now, enter the correct code
and let them release the gas. Now!

26:07.080 --> 26:12.677
- It's not arming. Why isn't it working?
- Maybe the remote's been damaged.

26:12.760 --> 26:15.911
- Make it work or I'll kill you.
- There's nothing I can do.

26:16.000 --> 26:20.471
- Make it work!
- I told you, there's nothing I can do!

26:22.040 --> 26:24.395
<i>Jack, can you hear me?</i>

26:34.240 --> 26:36.515
- Yes?
- We can't arm the canisters.

26:36.600 --> 26:39.717
- What is the problem?
- Rossler says he doesn't know.

26:39.800 --> 26:44.157
- Do you believe him?
- I don't know. Should I kill him?

26:44.680 --> 26:48.878
Not until we are sure
we have another way to release the gas.

26:48.960 --> 26:52.475
Andrei thinks he's discovered an alternative.
I'll put him on.

26:52.560 --> 26:54.755
Get him in the other room.

27:03.880 --> 27:05.393
Polakov.

27:05.480 --> 27:08.517
<i>- The canister is in front of you?
- Yeah.</i>

27:08.600 --> 27:12.479
<i>- You have the mechanism?
- Yeah, I have it right here.</i>

27:12.560 --> 27:16.758
<i>- Follow my instructions exactly.
- OK, I understand.</i>

27:16.840 --> 27:20.435
<i>In the trigger mechanism
you'll see multicoloured wires.</i>

27:20.520 --> 27:21.509
OK.

27:21.600 --> 27:24.512
<i>- Splice each wire individually.
- What's going on?</i>

27:24.600 --> 27:27.160
Andrei may have a way to release the gas.

27:55.320 --> 27:57.834
<i>- See the circuit configuration?
- I see it.</i>

27:57.920 --> 28:00.434
Now, move the jumper over.

28:02.400 --> 28:04.550
<i>Expose the red and yellow wire.</i>

28:04.640 --> 28:07.791
Hang on. I'm gonna put you on speakerphone.

28:08.840 --> 28:10.956
<i>Can the valve open without warning?</i>

28:11.040 --> 28:14.715
<i>If you make a mistake,
it could, so pay attention.</i>

28:14.800 --> 28:17.712
<i>- Five more splices to go.
- Which one now?</i>

28:17.800 --> 28:23.158
<i>The orange wire is next
in the sequence. Exactly as before.</i>

28:23.240 --> 28:27.279
<i>The white and blue wires need to be
connected through the circuit board,</i>

28:27.360 --> 28:29.157
<i>then into the release valve.</i>

28:29.240 --> 28:32.073
Get the masks. We're almost ready.

28:32.160 --> 28:34.754
<i>OK, Now you're ready to proceed.</i>

28:35.960 --> 28:39.316
<i>You'll see three inputs
on the bottom left of the circuit board.</i>

28:39.400 --> 28:41.755
<i>Three outputs on the top right.</i>

28:41.840 --> 28:43.910
<i>They are marked input one...</i>

28:44.000 --> 28:47.470
There is still time to stop them
before they murder those people.

28:47.560 --> 28:52.031
- We have a directive from the president.
- He signed these children's death warrant.

28:52.120 --> 28:55.715
More people could die
if these men don't lead us to the canisters.

28:55.800 --> 28:59.634
<i>They could. That's theoretical.
Those children will die in minutes.</i>

28:59.720 --> 29:02.393
- Look at them!
- Audrey, that's enough.

29:02.480 --> 29:05.392
If you were in Jack's shoes
would you follow that order?

29:05.480 --> 29:08.074
Stand and watch
as they murder all those people?

29:08.160 --> 29:10.563
This is war. There
will be casualties.

29:10.564 --> 29:14.156
If those were the orders of
the president, I'd have to.

29:15.360 --> 29:17.874
I hope that's not true.

29:19.160 --> 29:21.469
For your sake.

29:21.560 --> 29:24.358
<i>You have two more wires to go.</i>

29:30.200 --> 29:32.270
All right. The wires are together.

29:32.360 --> 29:36.353
Put your mask on.
The next pair you splice will open the valve.

29:36.440 --> 29:39.000
Go kill Rossler.

30:07.480 --> 30:09.152
Polakov. Polakov!

30:09.840 --> 30:11.637
<i>Polakov!</i>

30:36.360 --> 30:38.874
<i>Jack, can you hear me?</i>

30:47.680 --> 30:50.035
What's happening? What's your status?

30:50.120 --> 30:53.078
I stopped the gas,
but some got into the ventilation.

30:53.160 --> 30:56.118
- Evacuate the mall.
- What about the terrorists?

30:56.200 --> 30:59.829
One's dead, one escaped.
Have Curtis's men start looking for him.

30:59.920 --> 31:04.835
- Curtis, this is Buchanan. Move in now.
- About time. Move in. All teams, move in.

31:08.000 --> 31:12.551
Up against the wall. Terrorists have released
a toxic substance into the ventilation system.

31:12.640 --> 31:15.074
You need to evacuate people now.

31:15.160 --> 31:18.470
This is not a joke.
This is not a robbery or a drill. Do it now!

31:18.560 --> 31:21.916
We have a red alert.
Begin evacuation procedures immediately.

31:22.000 --> 31:26.152
- Where's the power source for ventilation?
- It's next to the food court.

31:26.240 --> 31:28.037
Get everybody out now.

31:28.120 --> 31:31.510
<i>To the nearest mall exit
in an orderly fashion.</i>

31:40.680 --> 31:43.672
- Curtis, it's Jack.
- We're closing in on the mall.

31:43.760 --> 31:48.276
I'll try and shut down the ventilation system.
I do not have a visual on the hostile.

31:48.360 --> 31:52.035
- Make sure your men take him alive.
- Understood.

32:44.360 --> 32:48.911
Curtis, it's Jack. The Sentox nerve gas
that escaped has stayed in the food court.

32:49.000 --> 32:53.437
I got at least 11 people down.
I need assistance. I need assistance now.

32:53.520 --> 32:56.956
<i>- Got it.
- Sweetheart, can you hear me?</i>

32:57.040 --> 33:01.909
I want you to hold the mask to your face
when I take it off, OK?

33:09.840 --> 33:14.960
All right, masks on. Inject anyone who's down
and get them outside as soon as possible.

33:15.040 --> 33:18.158
I need a shot of atropine
for a child under 12.

33:18.239 --> 33:21.036
Curtis, give me that
jacket for her head.

33:25.160 --> 33:27.469
I'm losing her.

33:35.360 --> 33:37.954
Come on.

33:38.040 --> 33:40.508
She's responding. Her pulse is stabilising.

33:40.600 --> 33:44.229
We've secured the exits.
We don't have a visual on the terrorist.

33:44.320 --> 33:48.518
If he got out of the mall
before we locked down, he may be lost.

33:48.600 --> 33:50.750
<i>He's our only chance offinding Erwich.</i>

33:50.840 --> 33:55.277
Monitor the tracking device in the remote
trigger. The hostile still had it on him.

33:55.360 --> 33:57.715
Chloe.

33:57.800 --> 34:02.191
Jack's right. The signal's moving away
from the mall. Looks like he's on foot.

34:02.280 --> 34:07.274
Michaels. Jack and I are going after
the remote trigger. You're in charge here.

34:07.360 --> 34:10.237
Walsh, gather your team. You're with us.

34:11.000 --> 34:15.915
Don't be scared. You're gonna be all right.
This man's gonna take care of you.

35:26.800 --> 35:29.678
Yes.

35:29.760 --> 35:34.117
Rossler - or whoever he was -
killed Komar and tried to stop us.

35:34.200 --> 35:36.395
- What? Why?
- I don't know.

35:36.480 --> 35:42.476
I managed to activate the valve before I got
away. At least some of the gas was released.

35:43.760 --> 35:48.197
- You sure you're not being followed?
- Yes. What do you want me to do?

35:48.280 --> 35:51.352
<i>- Come back here.
- I'll be there soon.</i>

35:57.320 --> 36:01.029
- He's turning left on Reese.
- We're six blocks out.

36:04.000 --> 36:08.437
<i>One moment, please, Mr McGill,
I'll connect you with the president.</i>

36:08.520 --> 36:09.509
<i>Yes?</i>

36:09.600 --> 36:13.957
Mr President, I thought it was important
to let you know what's happening.

36:14.040 --> 36:18.318
What's happening is I sent you over there
to make sure CTU was running smoothly

36:18.400 --> 36:20.391
and you seem to be incapable of that.

36:20.480 --> 36:24.268
- Bauer refused. There was nothing I could do.
- No, I don't want excuses.

36:24.360 --> 36:28.273
Just do your job, and if you can't do it
I'll find somebody else who can.

36:28.360 --> 36:31.716
The estimates from the mall are much lower
than we anticipated.

36:31.800 --> 36:36.396
It appears the fatalities will be limited
to between ten and 20 people.

36:36.480 --> 36:38.072
Thank God.

36:39.720 --> 36:42.757
- So, what are we telling the media?
- Nothing yet.

36:42.840 --> 36:46.913
CTU is maintaining a blackout
until we give them direction on a cover story.

36:47.000 --> 36:49.560
What about the other 19 canisters?

36:49.640 --> 36:53.189
CTU has a terrorist
under surveillance as we speak.

36:53.280 --> 36:58.308
They believe there's a good chance he'll lead
them to Erwich and the other canisters.

36:58.400 --> 37:00.231
All right. Good.

37:00.760 --> 37:05.914
There's something else, sir. Suzanne
Cummings has arrived to claim WaIt's body.

37:06.680 --> 37:10.229
Martha is on her way to speak with her now.

37:11.720 --> 37:13.790
Thank you, Mike.

37:40.240 --> 37:42.037
Suzanne.

37:52.600 --> 37:54.909
I can't believe he's gone.

37:55.000 --> 37:56.991
I'm sorry.

37:58.000 --> 37:59.797
I'm so, so sorry.

37:59.880 --> 38:03.668
- I should've been with him today.
- Don't do that.

38:03.760 --> 38:08.276
- I wanted to be.
- Honey, don't do that. Don't blame yourself.

38:08.360 --> 38:12.512
<i>He... told me to stay at the hotel.</i>

38:15.640 --> 38:17.915
You know how much we love you, honey.

38:18.000 --> 38:22.676
No matter what you need,
we'll always be here for you.

38:22.760 --> 38:27.470
I just don't understand.
This doesn't make any sense.

38:28.200 --> 38:31.112
You were with him today.

38:31.200 --> 38:36.672
Why, Martha?
Why in the world would... Walt do this?

38:40.560 --> 38:42.551
Suzanne.

38:44.080 --> 38:46.071
Walt...

38:49.280 --> 38:51.475
loved this country.

38:53.840 --> 38:56.115
And...

38:56.200 --> 38:58.589
he loved you.

39:07.200 --> 39:09.395
I'm sorry.

39:09.480 --> 39:11.835
I need a moment.

39:11.920 --> 39:14.309
Of course. All right.

39:43.080 --> 39:46.390
He's slowing down. He's stopping.

39:46.480 --> 39:49.040
Cross-referencing with the street grid.

39:49.120 --> 39:51.714
He's in front of 1136 East Muldower.

39:51.800 --> 39:56.351
Bill, we'll have to hit him hard and fast
to stop him from releasing any more Sentox.

39:56.440 --> 39:58.829
Agreed.

39:58.920 --> 40:01.514
Set up a perimeter. Begin your approach.

40:01.600 --> 40:06.799
- All right, all teams, we're moving in.
- Put your gas masks on.

40:38.160 --> 40:44.156
<i>Team B, take the front entrance off
the street. We're taking the side. Go now. Go.</i>

40:46.280 --> 40:48.794
Yes.

40:48.880 --> 40:50.950
- You were followed.
- I don't know how.

40:51.040 --> 40:53.998
It doesn't matter. You know what to do.

40:54.480 --> 40:56.232
Yes.

40:58.240 --> 40:59.753
No!

40:59.840 --> 41:03.628
Hostile down. I repeat, hostile down.

41:06.200 --> 41:08.077
Air is clean.

41:08.160 --> 41:10.310
Curtis, have your men call in now.

41:10.400 --> 41:12.789
Team A, team B, report.

41:13.840 --> 41:16.832
<i>- What have you got?
- There's no one here, We're clear.</i>

41:16.920 --> 41:19.878
- The place is empty.
- Erwich and the canisters are gone.

41:19.960 --> 41:23.111
We've got nothing here. Dammit!

41:24.305 --> 41:30.309
