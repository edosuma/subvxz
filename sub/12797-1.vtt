<i>Mars is
just a tiny dot in the sky.</i>

00:47.714 --> 00:49.615
<i>Forty million miles away.</i>

00:55.588 --> 00:56.722
<i>Nothing lives there.</i>

00:57.724 --> 00:59.191
<i>Nothing has ever died there,</i>

01:03.229 --> 01:05.063
<i>but I'm going
to bring it to life.</i>

01:09.269 --> 01:11.103
<i>Fourteen hours and counting.</i>

01:13.540 --> 01:14.573
Captain.

01:17.777 --> 01:19.211
Good luck, sir.

01:30.356 --> 01:34.193
Skinny.
Hey, excited?

01:34.195 --> 01:36.695
Of course, you?
You bet your ass I am.

02:04.624 --> 02:06.225
<i>Perform a.P.U. Start.</i>

02:08.394 --> 02:11.163
<i>Six billion people on earth</i>

02:11.165 --> 02:14.233
<i>cheering me on, but most of
them wondering why I'd do this.</i>

02:22.842 --> 02:26.245
<i>Commencing launch sequence.
O.S.M. Permit to close.</i>

02:26.247 --> 02:26.245
<i>O.S.M closed.</i>

02:26.247 --> 02:30.816
<i>Why leave this life behind to
die on some barren planet?</i>

02:30.818 --> 02:34.853
<i>- Vent one heater exit.
- Exit. S.S.C.</i>

02:34.855 --> 02:38.423
<i>Because I know it
won't be barren for long.</i>

02:38.425 --> 02:40.325
<i>- G.L.S. On.
- G.L.S. Is on.</i>

02:40.327 --> 02:42.161
<i>Final poll.
Houston flight?</i>

02:42.163 --> 02:42.161
<i>Houston flight is go.</i>

02:42.163 --> 02:45.230
<i>- Fido?
- Fido is go.</i>

02:45.232 --> 02:47.332

<i>T-minus ten, nine, eight...</i>

02:59.647 --> 03:02.181
<i>This is a one-way mission, but
I'm not going there to die.</i>

03:03.449 --> 03:05.951
<i>I'm going to Mars to live.</i>

05:11.477 --> 05:14.946
This is captain William d. Stanaforth
here aboard the good ship <i>Zephyr.</i>

05:15.982 --> 05:17.649
We are go for Mars.

05:17.651 --> 05:20.018
<i>Roger that, captain.</i>

05:20.020 --> 05:22.654
- Gravitational spin is on.
<i>- Copy that.</i>

05:23.557 --> 05:28.093
Requesting permission to kick off
my shoes for the rest of the ride.

05:28.095 --> 05:29.961
<i>Roger, captain,
you have permission.</i>

05:39.005 --> 05:40.872
<i>Lights, on.</i>

05:45.845 --> 05:47.679
<i>Welcome
to space, captain.</i>

05:48.849 --> 05:48.847
<i>You hear that?</i>

05:48.849 --> 05:52.718
<i>That's the crowd out in the
parking lot here in Houston.</i>

05:53.920 --> 05:55.020
<i>We're all thrilled.</i>

05:56.422 --> 05:58.924
<i>That said, we'd like to start</i>

05:58.926 --> 06:02.594
<i>running diagnostics on some of the
life support systems we can't monitor.</i>

06:04.030 --> 06:05.731
<i>Copy that stanaforth?</i>

06:05.733 --> 06:05.731
Yeah.

06:05.733 --> 06:10.969
<i>Starting with the essentials, let's
run a test of the air circulation</i>

06:10.971 --> 06:13.138
<i>and the water reactor.</i>

06:13.140 --> 06:14.740
Yeah,
give me a minute, skinny.

07:26.880 --> 07:28.447
Hello, little guys.

07:40.993 --> 07:43.028
<i>How life on
earth started is a mystery,</i>

07:48.234 --> 07:50.235
<i>but sustaining it
is an engineering problem.</i>

07:53.039 --> 07:56.508
<i>One meter of steel and insulation
separate me from nothingness.</i>

08:01.681 --> 08:04.649
<i>I can feel the pull
of the ship's rotation.</i>

08:04.651 --> 08:08.520
<i>My feet are heavy,
my head is light.</i>

08:08.522 --> 08:11.923
<i>This massive machine,
so tiny in the void of space,</i>

08:13.025 --> 08:15.026
<i>powerful but fragile.</i>

08:16.162 --> 08:18.864
<i>It's unnerving, but I love it.</i>

09:27.099 --> 09:30.902
<i>Hello, captain? It's time for your
first weekly student interface.</i>

09:30.904 --> 09:32.704
<i>Are you ready for the uplink?</i>

09:32.706 --> 09:35.140
Kind of busy here.

09:35.142 --> 09:39.177
<i>Stanaforth, take a break.
P.R. Is important, too.</i>

09:39.179 --> 09:41.680
<i>Plus a little human interaction
could do you good.</i>

09:49.722 --> 09:52.290
<i>Good morning captain
stanaforth, I'm Mrs. Wilson,</i>

09:52.292 --> 09:54.659
<i>and I'm going to be monitoring
the student q and a</i>

09:54.661 --> 09:56.795
<i>for the American youth
in science program.</i>

09:56.797 --> 10:00.365
<i>Our first question comes
from Samantha hopps.</i>

10:00.367 --> 10:02.901
<i>Hi, my question is,
if you make it to Mars,</i>

10:02.903 --> 10:06.171
<i>how will you be able
to survive the harsh climate?</i>

10:06.173 --> 10:11.710
When I get to Mars, we've already sent
up a lot of materials, fuel, food.

10:11.712 --> 10:15.747
But one of the big challenges was water.
They just can't send up enough.

10:15.749 --> 10:18.650
That's why I had been
working on this reactor.

10:18.652 --> 10:21.252
<i>Wow, you
made that? What does it do?</i>

10:23.155 --> 10:25.924
It's very similar to the
fuel cells on the ship.

10:25.926 --> 10:29.928
Like an electric car,
the product is power,

10:29.930 --> 10:31.730
and the byproduct
is drinking water.

10:33.165 --> 10:35.834
Only mine runs on dirt.

10:37.003 --> 10:37.002
<i>Dirt?</i>

10:37.004 --> 10:42.641
I invented a process to extract the
hydrogen and the oxygen from the soil,

10:42.643 --> 10:45.143
and recombine them,
which makes h20.

10:46.078 --> 10:47.712
No one thought it would work,

10:48.681 --> 10:50.915
so I went out to
the atacama desert

10:50.917 --> 10:55.286
alone, with no water,
and only one way to survive.

10:56.255 --> 10:57.989
To make that reactor work.

11:04.130 --> 11:09.167
<i>Day one, I'm making little adjustments.
My throat is parched.</i>

11:09.169 --> 11:14.105
Day two, I'm still working, but without
water I'm getting light-headed.

11:15.875 --> 11:17.909
I could have
radioed in for a rescue,

11:19.879 --> 11:21.346
but I thought I could fix it.

11:24.450 --> 11:26.851
<i>By day three, I'm
doing a full reset.</i>

12:12.164 --> 12:15.867
And in that instant, I knew
that this could work on Mars.

12:19.338 --> 12:24.909
With this step, I leave the earth
moving to a barren new planet.

12:27.213 --> 12:28.279
Hmm.

12:31.484 --> 12:33.418
With this step,
i leave the earth

12:34.820 --> 12:39.224
moving to a
pristine new planet.

12:45.197 --> 12:47.465
I'm leaving earth forever,
but I will not be alone.

12:49.301 --> 12:54.272
<i>I am leaving earth
but bringing humanity with me.</i>

12:55.374 --> 12:57.008
<i>Bringing you with me.</i>

12:58.844 --> 13:01.246
Mankind has transcended.

13:04.049 --> 13:09.287
Mankind has achieved
new heights... come on.

13:09.289 --> 13:13.958
I have come to another planet
seeking a new start, a fresh start,

13:15.094 --> 13:16.027
a new start.

13:16.896 --> 13:18.196
Take me to your leader.

13:53.500 --> 14:00.038
<i>Houston to</i> Zephyr. <i>It's 0800 hours.
Time to go to work.</i>

14:00.040 --> 14:02.574
What's the weather like at
Mars base camp right now?

14:02.576 --> 14:08.613
<i>You've got a high of about minus 10
degrees with some ice clouds moving in,</i>

14:08.615 --> 14:12.116
<i>and then it's going to drop
down to about minus 80 tonight.</i>

14:12.118 --> 14:14.185
Ice clouds?
<i>Yeah.</i>

14:14.187 --> 14:14.185
And in Houston?

14:14.187 --> 14:17.422
<i>Hot and humid.
Hurricane weather buddy.</i>

14:18.858 --> 14:21.926
<i>My family, we'd be
flying on days like this.</i>

14:21.928 --> 14:24.429
Yeah well, that is crazy.

14:24.431 --> 14:27.332
<i>Most people on earth think what
you're doing's pretty crazy.</i>

14:27.334 --> 14:29.267
It's a calculated risk.

14:29.269 --> 14:32.403
<i>Don't you have any worries
that something might go wrong?</i>

14:32.405 --> 14:35.540
Of course I'm worried, but I
only focus on things I control.

14:36.342 --> 14:37.275
<i>Like the weather?</i>

14:41.480 --> 14:42.480
<i>Someday.</i>

14:47.119 --> 14:47.986
Yeah!

15:04.003 --> 15:05.270
Stanaforth!

15:06.272 --> 15:07.538
You okay?

15:09.675 --> 15:12.310
I had to test
it out. It worked.

15:14.213 --> 15:16.581
They're going to
give us the mission.

15:16.583 --> 15:20.919
Whoa, I don't know that we're ready
for the mission, stanaforth.

15:21.987 --> 15:23.588
I know.

15:23.590 --> 15:25.990
Over the next five years we could
get 1,000 people up there.

15:27.259 --> 15:29.093
That planet is calling for us.

15:36.168 --> 15:38.202
Ship computer
<i>civilian interviews, edited.</i>

15:38.204 --> 15:42.106
<i>I'm applying for the
second Mars mission because</i>

15:42.108 --> 15:44.208
<i>I want to do something
great for humanity.</i>

15:44.210 --> 15:47.512
<i>Earth has so many problems.</i>

15:47.514 --> 15:51.115
<i>Inequality, war, natural
disasters, man-made disasters.</i>

15:52.584 --> 15:55.453
<i>I just don't think it's a
good place to live anymore.</i>

15:55.455 --> 15:59.257
<i>There's so much I love about earth
that we won't have on Mars.</i>

15:59.259 --> 16:03.962
<i>Oceans and forests,
animals, insects, rain.</i>

16:03.964 --> 16:06.364
<i>It's going to be
really hard to leave,</i>

16:06.366 --> 16:11.035
<i>but I'll give it all up to
experience something totally unique.</i>

16:11.037 --> 16:13.404
<i>I know there will
be just a few of us but,</i>

16:14.707 --> 16:16.607
<i>this will be the
most amazing people</i>

16:17.343 --> 16:20.345
<i>on earth, or on Mars.</i>

16:20.347 --> 16:23.047
<i>The most amazing
people in the universe.</i>

16:23.049 --> 16:26.217
<i>Captain stanaforth
is like a superhero.</i>

16:26.219 --> 16:30.755
<i>I don't want to be alone,
but I think that being alone,</i>

16:30.757 --> 16:37.495
<i>being one of only a dozen or a few
hundred people on an entire planet.</i>

16:37.497 --> 16:41.766
<i>There's a sort of melancholy to that,
which could be really beautiful.</i>

16:46.071 --> 16:48.639
<i>Supply depot coming up.</i>

16:48.641 --> 16:52.143
<i>Last stop for food and fuel
for the next 20 million miles.</i>

16:54.346 --> 16:55.279
<i>Captain?</i>

16:57.583 --> 16:59.017
<i>Earth to stanaforth.</i>

17:02.187 --> 17:03.254
<i>Stanaforth?</i>

17:03.256 --> 17:03.254
Yeah.

17:06.090 --> 17:08.159
<i>Hey,
I thought we lost you.</i>

17:08.727 --> 17:08.726
I wish you could.

17:08.728 --> 17:14.365
<i>Careful now. We're
approaching the space station.</i>

17:14.367 --> 17:17.268
<i>Because of the initial launch
delays, you won't have</i>

17:17.270 --> 17:19.503
<i>a lot of time up there
to load supplies.</i>

17:19.506 --> 17:23.174
Ah, come on skinny, these are the last
people I'm going to see for a long time.

18:00.179 --> 18:01.245
Hey.

18:08.654 --> 18:10.188
Fruits from the <i>Zephyr.</i>

18:13.592 --> 18:14.826
Ah!

18:16.595 --> 18:17.662
Mmm!

18:19.431 --> 18:22.300
You know I haven't had anything
this tasty in four months.

18:26.839 --> 18:28.573
Your garden didn't take?

18:28.575 --> 18:30.708
No, dead in two weeks.

18:31.577 --> 18:33.144
So far so good in mine,

18:35.280 --> 18:37.815
but we'll see.

18:37.817 --> 18:40.551
Endurance, <i>this is Houston.</i>
<i>Ready payload number two.</i>

18:42.521 --> 18:44.689
Fuck, can we even say hi here?

18:44.691 --> 18:48.126
<i>Oh yeah, sorry.
Hi greenstreet, how ya doing?</i>

18:48.128 --> 18:50.728
<i>Sorry you're still
stuck up there, buddy.</i>

18:50.730 --> 18:54.565
<i>Because of the initial launch delays, the
new departure time is in eight hours.</i>

18:55.601 --> 18:57.135
Might as well keep my suit on.

18:57.669 --> 18:58.836
Where's the captain?

18:59.872 --> 19:02.173
Hey worsley,

19:02.175 --> 19:04.308
captain stanaforth is here.
Can you come and say hi?

19:05.777 --> 19:07.712
Hey worsley, how ya doing?

20:26.558 --> 20:27.658
Hey, worsley.

20:32.297 --> 20:33.364
What's going on?

20:33.966 --> 20:35.433
You have plants.

20:35.435 --> 20:38.236
Yeah. For experiments.

20:39.271 --> 20:40.638
You hungry?

20:40.640 --> 20:41.672
We had mice.

20:43.275 --> 20:45.843
We were doing socialization
experiments on the mice,

20:45.845 --> 20:48.246
to see how they would
interact in the air lock.

20:49.715 --> 20:52.483
Have you ever seen a mouse
in zero gravity?

20:54.853 --> 20:55.920
They all died.

20:56.788 --> 20:57.989
Oh.

20:59.658 --> 20:59.657
Geez, I'm sorry.

20:59.659 --> 21:05.363
We thought, maybe they
would form different habits,

21:05.365 --> 21:09.934
or become depressed
or even kill each other,

21:09.936 --> 21:11.936
but they didn't.

21:13.705 --> 21:14.972
They just died.

21:40.699 --> 21:40.698
No, I didn't mean to, uh...

21:40.700 --> 21:45.036
No, no, no I'm just playing a
song for my daughter back home.

21:46.438 --> 21:48.506
I'm surprised mission
control gives you the time.

21:50.042 --> 21:52.343
Uh, we have a lot of time.

21:53.879 --> 21:55.646
Nothing but time.

21:55.648 --> 21:58.049
It must be hard being away
from your daughter so long.

22:00.519 --> 22:02.353
Abort your mission.

22:03.555 --> 22:06.390
- Excuse me?
- You heard me.

22:06.392 --> 22:10.494
Take all your fancy machines and
go back where you came from.

22:10.496 --> 22:12.029
I'm sorry, what the fuck
are you talking about?

22:13.965 --> 22:15.733
I'm just fucking with you.

22:15.735 --> 22:17.902
But seriously, I...

22:17.904 --> 22:20.504
You know I came up here
all cowboy like you.

22:21.440 --> 22:23.841
Seeking adventure
and all that,

22:23.843 --> 22:27.878
but I'm going back. I'm bringing
this experience back with me.

22:27.880 --> 22:30.114
I... I don't get you.

22:30.116 --> 22:33.351
I don't wanna go back.
I've seen enough.

22:33.353 --> 22:35.486
How could you
possibly have seen enough?

22:37.389 --> 22:39.423
I mean look at that.
I have tears

22:39.425 --> 22:41.125
every time the sun rises.

22:42.060 --> 22:43.494
Yeah, it's beautiful.

22:45.997 --> 22:47.531
You've only been up,

22:47.533 --> 22:49.367
what three weeks?

22:49.369 --> 22:51.469
You haven't forgotten yet.
Once you forget...

22:51.471 --> 22:53.838
I don't intend to forget,
but when you're down there

22:53.840 --> 22:53.838
everything just gets ruined.

22:53.840 --> 22:57.675
Ah, you callous fuck,
you think you know everything.

22:57.677 --> 22:57.675
- You think that...
- Endurance,

22:57.677 --> 23:02.480
<i>we've got a live feed of captain
Maddox's launch for you.</i>

23:04.082 --> 23:06.917

Don't go out there

24:46.017 --> 24:47.885
<i>Space station

25:14.880 --> 25:17.615
<i>Hi, captain stanaforth.</i>

25:17.617 --> 25:19.717
<i>What is it like
to look back at earth</i>

25:19.719 --> 25:23.254
<i>when you're further away than
any human being has ever been?</i>

25:23.256 --> 25:24.922
<i>It's amazing.</i>

25:24.924 --> 25:27.191
<i>When you have
this level of distance,</i>

25:27.193 --> 25:30.060
<i>there's a strange intimacy.</i>

25:32.230 --> 25:35.065
<i>When I watched
earth disappear,</i>

25:35.067 --> 25:38.536
I did remember this one night.

25:38.538 --> 25:40.204
My wife Casey,

25:40.206 --> 25:41.705
now ex-wife,

25:41.707 --> 25:43.207
she was receiving
the melville prize

25:43.209 --> 25:45.109
from some literary society.

25:45.111 --> 25:46.777
This black-tie thing,
and she's...

25:47.879 --> 25:49.780
Talking to these
other writers,

25:49.782 --> 25:52.116
brilliant people and uh...

25:52.118 --> 25:54.652
<i>And they were pouring their hearts out.
It was...</i>

25:55.287 --> 25:56.820
<i>Overwhelming.</i>

25:56.822 --> 25:58.856
So I snuck out.

25:58.858 --> 25:59.990
I didn't even
take my coat.

26:01.626 --> 26:04.094
I get out on the street,
i have no idea where I am,

26:04.096 --> 26:06.230
and it's freezing cold,

26:06.232 --> 26:08.265
but the streets are jammed

26:08.267 --> 26:11.101
with people, it's like
I'm taking on a current.

26:11.103 --> 26:13.203
I just started walking.

26:14.706 --> 26:16.707
<i>But I don't feel cold at all.</i>

26:18.043 --> 26:19.643
And uh...

26:21.012 --> 26:22.646
I turn a corner,

26:23.949 --> 26:25.683
and just then down
at the end of the street,

26:26.151 --> 26:27.651
above the river,

26:28.787 --> 26:30.321
the moon comes up.

26:32.257 --> 26:33.591
And it's huge.

26:35.026 --> 26:36.627
Lighting up the street.

26:38.296 --> 26:39.863
It feels like I...

26:40.632 --> 26:41.865
I just wanna

26:42.601 --> 26:44.034
walk right onto it.

26:45.971 --> 26:47.204
But I freeze.

26:49.074 --> 26:50.908
No one else
seems to notice.

26:53.845 --> 26:54.945
And in that moment,

26:55.914 --> 26:56.981
I felt...

27:01.786 --> 27:03.020
Completely alone.

27:08.159 --> 27:10.794
<i>I walked back to the dinner,</i>

27:10.796 --> 27:12.863
<i>and I stood outside
and I could see all these...</i>

27:12.865 --> 27:14.365
<i>People celebrating.</i>

27:14.367 --> 27:17.234
<i>I saw Casey,
she was glowing.</i>

27:19.037 --> 27:21.639
<i>And I knew I should
be in there with her.</i>

27:23.642 --> 27:26.343
<i>But I stood outside
and now I'm shivering.</i>

27:27.946 --> 27:30.848
<i>And I just, couldn't go in.</i>

27:33.318 --> 27:35.853
<i>It was like this, this...</i>

27:35.855 --> 27:38.389
Loneliness...
This feeling of being...

27:41.226 --> 27:43.327
Completely alone
was inside of me.

27:46.398 --> 27:47.898
And if I brought that in...

27:51.369 --> 27:52.736
Um...

27:54.673 --> 27:55.739
I just shouldn't bring it in.

28:26.337 --> 28:28.372
<i>Minor problem
on the reactor,</i>

28:28.374 --> 28:30.274
<i>but it's my job to fix it.</i>

28:35.947 --> 28:38.716
<i>I'm glad to have little challenges
to break up my routine.</i>

28:42.053 --> 28:45.923
<i>The ship is going
160,000 miles per hour,</i>

28:45.925 --> 28:47.224
<i>but I can't tell I'm moving.</i>

28:52.731 --> 28:54.398
<i>The sun comes through
the window once a week,</i>

28:56.201 --> 28:57.267
<i>and everything repeats.</i>

29:00.438 --> 29:03.040
<i>At first, that felt normal.</i>

29:17.489 --> 29:18.789
<i>The ship is getting filthy.</i>

29:21.793 --> 29:26.130
<i>It's fascinating to witness how much
matter can be generated by plant decay</i>

29:26.132 --> 29:27.264
<i>and my own skin.</i>

29:50.054 --> 29:51.789
<i>Greenstreet
and worsley have lost hope.</i>

29:54.092 --> 29:55.859
<i>I think that's because
their experiments failed.</i>

29:57.495 --> 29:59.129
<i>Their families
are waiting for them.</i>

30:01.332 --> 30:03.567
<i>That sense of
disappointment and longing</i>

30:03.569 --> 30:05.536
<i>can get in the way
of a mission like mine.</i>

30:13.511 --> 30:14.912
"The impossible..."

30:18.983 --> 30:22.286
<i>The struggle to survive
has proven...</i>

30:22.288 --> 30:24.488
<i>Uh... the struggle
of this journey</i>

30:24.490 --> 30:26.890
<i>has taken us further...</i>

30:27.325 --> 30:29.092
<i>And...</i>

30:29.094 --> 30:30.961
<i>One step further...</i>

30:32.096 --> 30:33.430
For mankind...

30:37.535 --> 30:40.337
One step further...

32:37.255 --> 32:39.389
<i>Calling Maddox.</i>

32:43.027 --> 32:45.595
I just had
a dream I was falling.

32:47.098 --> 32:49.333
Ironic, don't you think?

32:49.335 --> 32:51.168
<i>That's not a dream.</i>

32:51.170 --> 32:52.235
<i>You are falling.</i>

32:53.404 --> 32:54.738
You have any dreams
like that?

32:56.507 --> 32:58.108
<i>It's late, stanaforth.</i>

32:59.510 --> 33:01.078
Yeah, okay.

33:02.547 --> 33:04.014
You're right, I'm sorry.

33:16.161 --> 33:18.395
<i>Hey uncle bill,
happy birthday.</i>

33:18.397 --> 33:20.697
<i>I wish you happy birthday.</i>

33:24.502 --> 33:26.269
<i>All right,</i>

33:26.271 --> 33:28.538
<i>happy birthday, bill.
She says happy birthday.</i>

33:28.540 --> 33:29.639
<i>Happy birthday.</i>

33:29.641 --> 33:32.109
<i>Love you. Bye.</i>

33:32.111 --> 33:34.711
<i>Mucho gusto.

33:34.713 --> 33:36.747
<i>Mucho gusto.

33:36.749 --> 33:38.548
<i>Where are you

33:42.187 --> 33:43.420
<i>I'm from méxico,</i>

33:43.422 --> 33:45.589
<i>and you?

33:45.591 --> 33:46.790
<i>Soy de méxico, ? Y tú?</i>

34:13.083 --> 34:14.083
<i>Soy de marte.</i>

34:31.670 --> 34:33.170
Call Maddox.

34:40.244 --> 34:41.710
I guess we're
on our own out here.

34:42.746 --> 34:44.581
Houston,

34:44.583 --> 34:46.716
I seem
to have lost the signal.

34:49.654 --> 34:51.221
Houston?

34:51.223 --> 34:52.222
Houston?

34:52.857 --> 34:55.225
Skinny, do I have a signal?

34:58.162 --> 34:59.496
What the fuck?

35:02.733 --> 35:06.636
Houston, do you read me? This is
captain stanaforth aboard the <i>Zephyr.</i>

35:06.638 --> 35:08.371
I appear to have
lost the signal.

35:10.708 --> 35:13.677
Houston, this is captain
stanaforth aboard the <i>Zephyr.</i>

35:13.679 --> 35:15.679
Do you read me? I appear
to have lost the signal.

35:17.448 --> 35:18.448
Hello?

35:19.183 --> 35:20.884
Hello, hello!

35:20.886 --> 35:22.619
Fuck! Anyone?

35:25.423 --> 35:26.656
Skinny, come on.

35:26.658 --> 35:28.625
Can anyone hear me?

35:28.627 --> 35:30.160
<i>Stanaforth, what's going on?</i>

35:33.365 --> 35:34.798
Skinny, where the fuck
have you been?

35:34.800 --> 35:36.433
<i>Is everything okay?
What happened?</i>

35:36.435 --> 35:38.602
I just, uh, I tried
to reach Maddox,

35:38.604 --> 35:41.138
and then you, and...

35:42.373 --> 35:42.372
No one responded.

35:42.374 --> 35:46.276
<i>Look, we need you
to go radio silent for a bit</i>

35:46.278 --> 35:48.411
<i>while we deal with the
situation with Maddox.</i>

35:48.413 --> 35:50.180
Okay. Wait, wait.

35:50.182 --> 35:51.615
What's going on with Maddox?
<i>Sit tight.</i>

35:51.617 --> 35:53.450
Skinny?

35:53.452 --> 35:55.886
Call Maddox.

35:55.888 --> 35:57.554
<i>Calling Maddox.</i>

35:57.556 --> 35:59.890
Maddox, this is stanaforth.
Do you copy?

35:59.892 --> 36:02.492
<i>What are you after?</i>

36:02.494 --> 36:04.194
Always pleasant to hear
from you too, captain.

36:04.196 --> 36:06.196
I just nearly lost it
missing you.

36:06.931 --> 36:08.265
<i>I'm off course.</i>

36:08.267 --> 36:08.265
What?

36:08.267 --> 36:13.537
<i>Maddox, when was the last time you
performed maintenance on your gyros?</i>

36:13.539 --> 36:16.573
<i>Oh, no, no. You're always
trying to pin this shit on me.</i>

36:16.575 --> 36:18.542
<i>Why didn't your
software detect the issue?</i>

36:18.544 --> 36:20.610
<i>I'm not trying
to pin anything on you.</i>

36:20.612 --> 36:20.610
<i>We've been running
diagnostics down here</i>

36:20.612 --> 36:26.383
<i>and we think a malfunction with your
gyroscope is what's causing the issue.</i>

36:26.385 --> 36:28.552
Houston, I can fix
her gyroscopes.

36:28.554 --> 36:29.886
<i>Stand down captain.</i>

36:29.888 --> 36:29.886
<i>Houston's taking
care of the issue.</i>

36:29.888 --> 36:33.757
And the whole time she's veering
further and further off course.

36:33.759 --> 36:36.293
<i>Just let us
deal with it, okay?</i>

36:36.295 --> 36:38.361
Skinny, I know this
ship from top to bottom,

36:38.363 --> 36:39.930
better than anyone.

36:39.932 --> 36:41.565
Now listen to me Maddox,

36:42.366 --> 36:44.301
you've got something wrong,

36:44.303 --> 36:44.301
I probably do, too.

36:44.303 --> 36:49.439
<i>Skinny, he's right. You work on
your software, we'll try this.</i>

36:49.441 --> 36:51.374
Get into
the equipment bay, 0-8-2.

36:52.610 --> 36:54.211
Disable your gyros.

36:54.213 --> 36:55.812
<i>0-8-2, copy.</i>

36:57.448 --> 36:58.982
Any condensation
on the sensors?

36:58.984 --> 37:00.350
<i>I don't see any.</i>

37:00.352 --> 37:02.352
Wipe it down
anyway and restart.

37:02.354 --> 37:02.352
<i>Both of you
listen to me.</i>

37:02.354 --> 37:05.288
<i>We can handle
this from down here.</i>

37:05.923 --> 37:05.922
Did it start?

37:05.924 --> 37:10.327
<i>No, but I'm seeing that my
port has a crack in it.</i>

37:10.329 --> 37:11.795
Mine looks fine.

37:11.797 --> 37:12.929
That must be your problem.

37:12.931 --> 37:14.264
<i>So what's next?</i>

37:14.266 --> 37:15.632
Okay, here's what
we're gonna do.

37:17.368 --> 37:19.569
Go to your bunk monitor.

37:19.571 --> 37:21.805
Pull off the e103 cable.

37:21.807 --> 37:23.273
<i>Copy that.</i>

37:27.845 --> 37:30.347
Get a connector from the
mid-deck junction box.

37:31.415 --> 37:31.414
<i>Got it.</i>

37:31.416 --> 37:35.452
<i>You can't just start pulling
cables out of the wall</i>

37:35.454 --> 37:37.587
<i>without asking permission
from engineering.</i>

37:37.589 --> 37:40.257
The engineers will be glad there
are real people here now.

37:40.259 --> 37:41.558
I'm cleaning up their mess.

37:41.560 --> 37:43.026
<i>Stop all right!</i>

37:43.028 --> 37:44.928
Now screw in the four-pin.

37:44.930 --> 37:46.396
Flip it on.

37:47.632 --> 37:48.999
<i>It worked.</i>

37:50.302 --> 37:51.368
Fantastic.

37:53.704 --> 37:55.705
<i>Holy shit.</i>

37:55.707 --> 37:58.308
<i>I'm starting to get good
readings from down here, too.</i>

38:00.544 --> 38:03.446
<i>Thanks, captain. Hopefully,
we'll end up in the same place.</i>

38:25.603 --> 38:29.539
<i>I've climbed almost every
major mountain on earth.</i>

38:29.541 --> 38:33.310
<i>I've deep-sea dived,
I've paraglided.</i>

38:33.312 --> 38:38.348
<i>Nothing could ever touch
something like going to Mars.</i>

38:38.350 --> 38:41.484
<i>As an engineer, I'm excited for the
technical challenges of the mission.</i>

38:41.486 --> 38:44.921
<i>I know that with people all around the
world pushing mankind to get to Mars,</i>

38:44.923 --> 38:48.725
<i>we are going to discover things
we can't even dream of now.</i>

38:48.727 --> 38:51.728
<i>Great science
will come from this mission...</i>

38:51.730 --> 38:54.698
<i>But even greater
inspiration will come</i>

38:54.700 --> 38:58.601
<i>from the simple gesture
of getting there.</i>

39:18.122 --> 39:20.757
<i>this discovery has now
been confirmed with new data,</i>

39:20.759 --> 39:23.426
<i>and seems to be correct.</i>

39:23.428 --> 39:26.062
<i>The cosmic expansion
that hubble discovered,</i>

39:26.064 --> 39:28.965
<i>is now modulated
by an acceleration term.</i>

39:28.967 --> 39:32.035
<i>Its expansion is
ever faster with time,</i>

39:32.037 --> 39:37.540
<i>and in that scenario, the universe
ends in a catastrophic crescendo</i>

39:37.542 --> 39:40.076
<i>where space-time on the largest
scale is ripped apart,</i>

39:40.078 --> 39:43.380
<i>and then within a very short
time, maybe minutes or hours,</i>

39:43.382 --> 39:45.448
<i>matter itself
is ripped apart.</i>

39:45.450 --> 39:48.518
<i>The atoms of the universe,
all of them...</i>

39:59.630 --> 40:00.563
Grass.

40:02.400 --> 40:04.634
"Fresh-cut grass."

40:35.132 --> 40:36.666
Ugh.

41:37.761 --> 41:40.263
<i>Space is leaking
into the ship.</i>

41:42.733 --> 41:45.235
Uh, Houston?

41:45.237 --> 41:47.737
You won't be able to see
this right now, but I've got

41:47.739 --> 41:49.606
a solar flare coming through.

41:51.642 --> 41:53.776
The particles are passing
through my eyes.

44:28.332 --> 44:31.834
Two-thirds approximately,
that's...

44:31.836 --> 44:33.202
<i>I fucked up.</i>

44:34.705 --> 44:37.674
<i>I short-circuited the battery,</i>

44:37.676 --> 44:39.308
<i>which contaminated
the water supply.</i>

44:41.145 --> 44:42.245
<i>Maybe skinny could help.</i>

44:43.847 --> 44:45.248
<i>I trust him,</i>

44:45.250 --> 44:46.949
<i>but the situation
isn't desperate yet.</i>

45:03.300 --> 45:06.469
<i>I've survived before on 600
milliliters of water a day,</i>

45:09.206 --> 45:11.074
<i>but not for this long.</i>

45:13.377 --> 45:16.813
<i>It's my fault the water
is contaminated, though.</i>

45:16.815 --> 45:19.182
<i>And I'm gonna
be the one to fix it.</i>

45:24.822 --> 45:27.023
<i>I have to lie
about the reactor,</i>

45:27.025 --> 45:30.393
<i>because if skinny finds out,
they'll abort the mission.</i>

45:58.223 --> 46:00.089
Fucking condensation.

46:03.127 --> 46:05.128
<i>There's nothing to look at,</i>

46:07.464 --> 46:09.766
<i>but now I can't even
see outside.</i>

46:29.287 --> 46:31.420
<i>Hey, buddy,</i>

46:31.422 --> 46:34.157
<i>I haven't talked to you in a couple days.
How are you doing?</i>

46:34.159 --> 46:34.157
I'm fine.

46:34.159 --> 46:39.562
<i>Look, all the work you're doing on the
reactor's getting people a little worried.</i>

46:40.497 --> 46:42.131
<i>Everything okay?</i>

46:42.133 --> 46:42.131
Yeah.

46:42.133 --> 46:48.571
<i>I want that thing to still be working
if I get up there in a couple years.</i>

46:48.573 --> 46:52.975
<i>You know, if anything goes wrong up
there, we'd have to bring you home.</i>

46:53.110 --> 46:54.911
Home? No.

46:56.046 --> 46:59.148
Look, skinny,
essential systems are fine.

46:59.150 --> 47:01.818
I'm just running
some routine maintenance.

47:01.820 --> 47:05.321
<i>Yeah, but I'm getting an earful
from the guys in operations,</i>

47:05.323 --> 47:08.124
<i>and they'd definitely prefer
it if you just left it be.</i>

47:08.126 --> 47:09.492
<i>Okay?</i>

48:20.230 --> 48:21.898
Ah!

48:46.623 --> 48:48.457
<i>Can't sleep?</i>

48:50.961 --> 48:53.296
Sleep is on the ship
like a ghost.

48:54.364 --> 48:57.166
<i>Sorry, what?</i>
Never mind.

48:57.168 --> 48:59.502
<i>Why don't you
take a sleeping pill?</i>

48:59.504 --> 49:02.571
I don't like the way
those things make me feel.

49:02.573 --> 49:05.574
<i>Well, I'm glad
you're still awake.</i>

49:05.576 --> 49:07.543
<i>I have some bad news
about Maddox.</i>

49:07.545 --> 49:09.645
Oh, really?

49:09.647 --> 49:13.416
<i>The fix you made on her
gyroscope didn't hold.</i>

49:13.418 --> 49:16.185
<i>I'm afraid we're going
to have to turn her around.</i>

49:18.188 --> 49:20.022
<i>You okay there, captain?</i>

49:21.091 --> 49:23.592
<i>Look, I just need you
to assure me</i>

49:23.594 --> 49:25.695
<i>that you're going to be able
to keep it together up there.</i>

49:25.697 --> 49:28.597
Oh, c'mon, what does that mean, huh?
What does that... I...

49:28.599 --> 49:30.232
What does that even mean?

49:30.234 --> 49:33.536
<i>It means stay sane
and stay focused,</i>

49:33.538 --> 49:35.504
<i>so we don't have
any more problems.</i>

49:38.041 --> 49:42.078
<i>Stanaforth, I'm waiting for you to tell
me that you're going to be all right.</i>

49:42.080 --> 49:45.047
Well, that is a stupid thing
to wait for.

49:47.351 --> 49:51.988
<i>I remember waiting for you to come
out of that desert, you know?</i>

49:51.990 --> 49:54.290
<i>When you finally
got to that rendezvous.</i>

49:55.425 --> 49:57.693
<i>Lookin' like snake skin.</i>

49:57.695 --> 50:00.529
<i>Do you recall what you said to me?
You remember what you said?</i>

50:00.531 --> 50:00.529
What?

50:00.531 --> 50:06.035
<i>You said, "skinny, I
squeezed water from a stone."</i>

50:12.442 --> 50:14.343
Well, that's half true.

50:20.050 --> 50:22.518
We really have to
abort her mission?

50:22.520 --> 50:24.787
<i>Yeah, we tried everything.</i>

50:24.789 --> 50:27.156
<i>She has to come home, captain.</i>

50:55.719 --> 50:57.386
I'm in here,

51:00.323 --> 51:02.792
and every single
other thing is out there.

53:22.766 --> 53:24.567
<i>Condensation.</i>

53:26.937 --> 53:29.338
<i>It's as dry
as a desert in here,</i>

53:31.741 --> 53:33.842
<i>but it's a closed system.</i>

53:56.600 --> 53:57.933
<i>The ship,</i>

53:58.735 --> 54:00.302
<i>the plants,</i>

54:03.974 --> 54:06.642
<i>they have to give up
their water for me.</i>

54:22.659 --> 54:24.360
I'm sorry.

54:26.029 --> 54:27.396
Come on.

54:29.499 --> 54:31.367
<i>It's all connected.</i>

54:41.344 --> 54:44.780
<i>I just have to replicate
systems that work in nature.</i>

55:06.936 --> 55:08.837
<i>Hope is out there.</i>

55:40.537 --> 55:43.472
<i>Super-heat the soil,
compress it.</i>

55:47.944 --> 55:51.480
<i>Extract the hydrogen and the
oxygen, recombine them.</i>

55:57.620 --> 56:01.357
<i>This is how the
universe made water.</i>

56:01.359 --> 56:03.425
<i>This is how life
on earth formed.</i>

56:24.814 --> 56:27.416
<i>And I'm trying to
recreate the process.</i>

57:31.614 --> 57:34.683
<i>I might have enough water
to survive the journey.</i>

57:45.795 --> 57:47.963
<i>But if I can't make
the reactor work,</i>

57:47.965 --> 57:49.598
<i>what's the point?</i>

57:52.936 --> 57:54.870
<i>I'll just die alone on Mars.</i>

57:57.040 --> 57:59.575
Come on.

58:04.814 --> 58:06.748
Ah! Fuck!

58:07.617 --> 58:09.952
Goddammit.

58:14.190 --> 58:17.860
Work with me, you stupid
piece of fucking junk!

58:27.036 --> 58:30.172
Shit, I'm sorry.

58:30.174 --> 58:32.975
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm sorry,
I didn't mean it. I'm sorry.

58:41.618 --> 58:44.786
<i>Jesus, captain,
what's going on?</i>

58:44.788 --> 58:47.589
<i>You look like shit,
the ship's a mess.</i>

58:48.291 --> 58:50.759
<i>People are worried about you.</i>

58:50.761 --> 58:54.596
<i>Everyone's asking me
what's going on with you,</i>

58:54.598 --> 58:56.865
<i>and I don't know
what to tell them.</i>

58:58.835 --> 58:59.935
<i>Huh?</i>

59:02.305 --> 59:06.275
<i>Stanaforth, c'mon you
gotta talk to me here.</i>

59:10.146 --> 59:11.980
Skinny, I fucked up.

59:13.983 --> 59:15.784
I, uh...

59:17.754 --> 59:20.122
I plugged into the...
Yeah, my...

59:21.624 --> 59:24.660
My power is...
My water supply's fucked.

59:24.662 --> 59:26.295
I poisoned the supply.

59:26.297 --> 59:27.663
<i>What?</i>

59:28.565 --> 59:30.198
<i>How is that possible?</i>

59:30.900 --> 59:33.101
<i>What happened?</i>

59:33.103 --> 59:36.238
I just thought I knew...

59:38.007 --> 59:42.744
What it would be like, but I just...
I don't know, I...

59:42.746 --> 59:47.015
<i>Okay, look. Protocol dictates
you return to earth right now.</i>

59:47.017 --> 59:49.685
<i>Abort the mission,
get you home.</i>

59:49.687 --> 59:52.321
<i>Hopefully we can
bring you back safely.</i>

59:52.323 --> 59:52.321
<i>But what have you
tried already?</i>

59:52.323 --> 59:58.260
<i>Is there anything that we can
do to get it working again?</i>

59:58.262 --> 01:00:02.097
<i>We'll have at least a day or two before
we're able to turn you around and...</i>

01:00:02.099 --> 01:00:05.334
<i>I know this ship
better than anyone.</i>

01:00:09.973 --> 01:00:12.074
<i>I couldn't get it to work.</i>

01:00:47.276 --> 01:00:52.914
<i>It's amazing that we can build these
machines to shoot us through space.</i>

01:00:52.916 --> 01:00:57.352
<i>But in the end we're just these
fragile little creatures</i>

01:00:57.354 --> 01:01:01.223
<i>staring out
at the universe, learning.</i>

01:01:01.225 --> 01:01:03.859
<i>The important thing
is not the technology,</i>

01:01:03.861 --> 01:01:06.294
<i>but the humanity.</i>

01:01:06.296 --> 01:01:12.334
<i>The technology enables us to experience
something really astonishing.</i>

01:01:12.336 --> 01:01:16.838
<i>To walk on Mars, to watch the
sunset from another planet.</i>

01:01:17.807 --> 01:01:22.411
<i>That kind of raw
emotional experience</i>

01:01:22.413 --> 01:01:25.881
<i>is what's really significant
in this journey.</i>

01:01:27.817 --> 01:01:29.184
<i>End transmission.</i>

01:01:36.192 --> 01:01:38.326
<i>I thought I had
everything figured out.</i>

01:01:47.403 --> 01:01:49.805
<i>I spent years
planning this mission.</i>

01:01:55.878 --> 01:01:58.947
<i>I designed a machine so we
could live on another planet.</i>

01:02:02.018 --> 01:02:04.419
<i>I made this thing
work in the desert but...</i>

01:02:07.323 --> 01:02:09.758
<i>But that wasn't
the reason I, um...</i>

01:02:10.893 --> 01:02:12.728
<i>That wasn't the moment.</i>

01:02:15.064 --> 01:02:17.099
I drank the land.

01:02:22.371 --> 01:02:25.941
But just when
i got it working,

01:02:25.943 --> 01:02:28.744
the minute I was
gonna take a drink...

01:02:31.481 --> 01:02:34.783
My foot, my leg
went numb. Bang.

01:02:35.752 --> 01:02:37.185
I collapsed.

01:02:40.089 --> 01:02:42.324
I tried to take a drink,
i couldn't...

01:02:44.093 --> 01:02:46.962
I couldn't grip the bottle.
My hand was like...

01:02:50.066 --> 01:02:51.233
Air.

01:02:53.236 --> 01:02:55.337
<i>I thought I was evaporating.</i>

01:02:58.841 --> 01:03:01.343
<i>I lay down in the sand,</i>

01:03:01.345 --> 01:03:03.044
<i>I wove myself in.</i>

01:03:08.184 --> 01:03:09.985
And this barrier

01:03:11.254 --> 01:03:14.156
between me and everything

01:03:15.491 --> 01:03:17.359
just dissolved.

01:03:23.099 --> 01:03:24.800
And I could die,

01:03:26.936 --> 01:03:28.904
because life is enormous.

01:03:32.809 --> 01:03:34.142
And I loved
the feeling of dying,

01:03:38.581 --> 01:03:40.949
and then it passed.

01:03:42.418 --> 01:03:43.985
The feeling passed.

01:03:43.987 --> 01:03:48.223
I could feel my hands,

01:03:48.225 --> 01:03:52.394
my feet. I got up,
i walked to the rendezvous.

01:03:55.031 --> 01:03:57.866
And I made up my mind
right there and then.

01:04:00.570 --> 01:04:02.904
To go on a one-way
mission to Mars.

01:04:39.443 --> 01:04:41.076
<i>Good morning, stanaforth.</i>

01:04:41.078 --> 01:04:43.879
<i>Time to put on
your flight suit.</i>

01:04:43.881 --> 01:04:46.648
<i>Houston will be taking
the wheel for the turnaround,</i>

01:04:46.650 --> 01:04:50.318
<i>but we're gonna need you in the
cockpit in case of an emergency.</i>

01:04:51.587 --> 01:04:54.055
<i>Fuel has been sent up
to the space station.</i>

01:04:54.057 --> 01:04:57.525
<i>That'll get you the rest
of the way home and...</i>

01:05:03.499 --> 01:05:06.067
<i>The mission has failed,</i>

01:05:09.505 --> 01:05:11.439
<i>but I can't go back.</i>

01:05:20.950 --> 01:05:23.418
<i>I don't care
if the machines don't work,</i>

01:05:25.254 --> 01:05:27.155
<i>if no one else is coming.</i>

01:05:32.962 --> 01:05:35.030
<i>I know what waits
for me on earth,</i>

01:05:39.468 --> 01:05:41.236
<i>but not up there.</i>

01:05:43.306 --> 01:05:46.308
<i>What are you doing?
What's going on?</i>

01:05:47.343 --> 01:05:51.179
<i>Did you just
override the controls?</i>

01:05:51.181 --> 01:05:56.084
<i>Stanaforth, you will wind up off course.
Do you understand me?</i>

01:06:02.425 --> 01:06:05.427
<i>You're gonna
end up off course.</i>

01:06:05.429 --> 01:06:05.427
<i>Are you listening?</i>

01:06:05.429 --> 01:06:12.367
<i>I'm trying to help you. Goddammit,
stanaforth, stop! That's an order, captain.</i>

01:06:12.369 --> 01:06:13.969
<i>Stanaforth!</i>

01:08:32.875 --> 01:08:37.278
<i>I hope someone, someday,
will read this journal.</i>

01:08:40.316 --> 01:08:41.850
<i>I don't know
if I'm on course.</i>

01:08:41.852 --> 01:08:44.219
<i>My ship isn't telling me.</i>

01:08:49.358 --> 01:08:54.194
<i>If I miscalculated, I'll miss
Mars by a million miles,</i>

01:08:55.564 --> 01:08:59.134
<i>drifting into space forever.</i>

01:09:15.151 --> 01:09:17.484
<i>I keep up my routine,</i>

01:09:17.487 --> 01:09:19.621
<i>but I've lost hope
in the mission.</i>

01:10:04.200 --> 01:10:05.266
Hoe!

01:10:06.435 --> 01:10:08.937
Huh, huh, huh,

01:10:10.573 --> 01:10:14.642
hoe, hoe, hoe.

01:10:15.878 --> 01:10:16.945
Hoe!

01:10:37.700 --> 01:10:40.468
<i>So many people wanted
to be part of this journey,</i>

01:10:40.470 --> 01:10:43.271
<i>and sent me messages
along the way.</i>

01:10:45.841 --> 01:10:47.242
<i>I let you down.</i>

01:11:05.894 --> 01:11:08.896
<i>Maddox trusted me,</i>

01:11:10.733 --> 01:11:12.267
<i>and then I failed.</i>

01:11:15.471 --> 01:11:17.872
<i>I hope someday you get
another mission.</i>

01:11:20.009 --> 01:11:22.577
<i>To keep going with
what we started.</i>

01:11:40.729 --> 01:11:42.764
<i>And skinny...</i>

01:11:44.900 --> 01:11:48.403
<i>I can almost hear
you out there,</i>

01:11:48.937 --> 01:11:50.471
<i>trying to reach me.</i>

01:11:53.075 --> 01:11:54.776
<i>Now that I'm not
going to make it,</i>

01:11:56.312 --> 01:11:58.379
<i>you must feel like
I do.</i>

01:12:00.449 --> 01:12:01.316
<i>Broken.</i>

01:12:03.652 --> 01:12:04.719
<i>Empty.</i>

01:12:30.813 --> 01:12:35.416
<i>For me, I'm trapped
inside my own machine.</i>

01:12:38.954 --> 01:12:41.823
<i>Pressed down by gravity.</i>

01:12:44.526 --> 01:12:47.061
<i>Wringing out the last
drops of water,</i>

01:12:47.063 --> 01:12:48.796
<i>withering away.</i>

01:12:53.836 --> 01:12:56.537
<i>What does it matter
if I live another day,</i>

01:12:56.539 --> 01:12:59.774
<i>another week, drying
up in this tiny box?</i>

01:13:06.448 --> 01:13:08.549
This is all
i have left to give.

01:13:12.955 --> 01:13:15.390
<i>I want to get out there.</i>

01:13:20.596 --> 01:13:25.800
<i>I wanna be ripped apart
by space, overwhelmed.</i>

01:13:30.873 --> 01:13:33.574
<i>Why not open the hatch
and step outside?</i>

01:14:00.103 --> 01:14:01.102
<i>Stanaf...</i>

01:14:04.606 --> 01:14:05.773
<i>I'm trying to...</i>

01:14:05.775 --> 01:14:06.674
<i>If you...</i>

01:14:09.579 --> 01:14:12.079
<i>Stana... skinny,
are you there...</i>

01:14:21.690 --> 01:14:24.592
<i>Houston, trying to reach...</i>

01:14:27.930 --> 01:14:31.232
<i>If you're alive...
Let us know...</i>

01:14:33.101 --> 01:14:33.968
<i>Can you hear...</i>

01:14:38.507 --> 01:14:39.941
<i>If you... signal...</i>

01:14:39.943 --> 01:14:41.008
<i>Get through the...</i>

01:14:42.878 --> 01:14:44.512
<i>Stanaforth, are you...</i>

01:14:46.915 --> 01:14:48.516
<i>Magnetic storm...</i>

01:14:49.017 --> 01:14:50.885
<i>You're close to a...</i>

01:14:53.155 --> 01:14:57.859
<i>Storm safely...
You'll be there...</i>

01:14:58.727 --> 01:14:59.827
<i>Close...</i>

01:15:03.932 --> 01:15:06.100
<i>We're rooting for you...</i>

01:15:06.102 --> 01:15:07.235
Skinny...

01:15:07.237 --> 01:15:08.603
<i>Whole world...</i>

01:15:08.605 --> 01:15:09.670
It's me.

01:15:09.672 --> 01:15:14.175
<i>Stanaforth,
come in.</i>

01:15:14.177 --> 01:15:16.844
Yeah, I'm here. I'm...

01:15:16.846 --> 01:15:20.214
<i>Skinny... so...</i>

01:15:20.216 --> 01:15:23.618
<i>You're so close.</i>

01:16:35.691 --> 01:16:36.657
This is it.

01:17:00.215 --> 01:17:04.685
<i>Our bodies are
more space than matter.</i>

01:17:07.723 --> 01:17:10.758
<i>There's an unfathomable
distance between each atom,</i>

01:17:11.693 --> 01:17:12.727
<i>each particle.</i>

01:17:21.203 --> 01:17:22.703
<i>What keeps us solid?</i>

01:17:28.410 --> 01:17:30.044
<i>Why don't we dissolve?</i>

01:17:35.150 --> 01:17:37.251
<i>This is why I came here.</i>

01:17:42.090 --> 01:17:43.724
<i>To give everything up.</i>

01:17:46.161 --> 01:17:51.399
<i>For one moment
of pure wonder.</i>

01:18:32.741 --> 01:18:36.911
<i>I don't know if anyone can
hear me, but here goes.</i>

01:18:36.913 --> 01:18:40.014
Houston, Zephyr is go
for landing.

01:18:49.758 --> 01:18:51.025
Zephyr released.

01:19:08.510 --> 01:19:09.877
Three minutes.

01:19:29.464 --> 01:19:31.365
Two minutes,
fuel light is on.

01:19:51.486 --> 01:19:53.087
One minute.

01:19:59.861 --> 01:20:01.195
There's the spot!

01:20:05.400 --> 01:20:07.368
Thirty meters, two down.

01:20:08.336 --> 01:20:10.070
Ten meters, three forward.

01:20:10.072 --> 01:20:12.006
Five meters.

01:20:17.547 --> 01:20:19.446
Down.

01:20:22.484 --> 01:20:28.355
<i>Houston, this is captain William d.
Stanaforth on the surface of Mars.</i>

01:21:49.104 --> 01:21:51.171
<i>Nothing has ever lived here.</i>

01:22:00.548 --> 01:22:02.917
<i>Nothing has ever died here.</i>

01:22:16.464 --> 01:22:18.232
<i>Maybe I'll live forever.</i>
