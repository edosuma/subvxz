00:13.331 --> 00:16.299
<b>6x13 - "Sacrifice" </b>

00:23.816 --> 00:25.985
<i>Darkness on Dagobah!</i>

00:26.027 --> 00:28.154
<i>All attention is focused on Yoda,</i>

00:28.196 --> 00:31.991
<i>who claims to hear the voice
of a long-dead Jedi.</i>

00:32.033 --> 00:35.203
<i>Convinced that he is guided
by Qui-Gon Jinn,</i>

00:35.245 --> 00:38.381
<i>he finds five priestesses
who will teach him</i>

00:38.382 --> 00:42.085
<i>how to manifest consciousness
after death.</i>

00:42.127 --> 00:45.213
<i>After many trials,
Yoda travels to Moraband,</i>

00:45.255 --> 00:48.216
<i>ancient home planet
of the Sith,</i>

00:48.258 --> 00:50.843
<i>for now he must face
the true evil</i>

00:50.885 --> 00:52.845
<i>that may be his undoing</i>

00:52.887 --> 00:56.224
<i>and one that seeks
to control the galaxy.</i>

01:01.229 --> 01:03.022
Careful we must be.

01:03.064 --> 01:05.024
Deserted this planet was,

01:05.066 --> 01:08.194
long ago after many wars.

01:47.317 --> 01:49.610
Again, leave you I must, my friend.

01:49.652 --> 01:52.238
Guard the ship you will.

01:52.280 --> 01:54.615
If return I do not by three nightfalls,

01:54.657 --> 01:57.035
take the ship to Coruscant you shall.

01:57.076 --> 01:58.410
Tell them of where I went.

03:10.733 --> 03:14.112
We are the Sith.

03:14.153 --> 03:17.156
Afraid of you I am not.

03:17.198 --> 03:19.784
We shall see.

03:44.225 --> 03:48.520
There is no life after death.

03:48.562 --> 03:52.483
Only nothingness awaits you, Jedi.

03:52.524 --> 03:57.529
Your fear feeds
our hunger for power.

03:57.571 --> 04:02.534
They will know you are here.
We will tell them.

04:02.576 --> 04:06.538
You will die
and be nothing.

04:15.465 --> 04:19.844
Sir, you have been ordered
to go to Coruscant immediately.

04:19.885 --> 04:23.473
Tell Lord Sidious I am on my way.

05:29.372 --> 05:34.960
Why do you come to my tomb, Jedi?

05:35.002 --> 05:36.421
To learn.

05:36.462 --> 05:40.425
Do you know who I am?

05:40.466 --> 05:43.469
Yes.
Darth Bane.

05:43.511 --> 05:45.679
The ancient Sith Lord, you are.

05:45.721 --> 05:50.059
And know why I am not forgotten?

05:50.101 --> 05:53.563
Created the Rule of Two you did.

05:53.603 --> 05:56.566
The Sith killed each other...

05:56.606 --> 05:59.985
Victims of their own greed.

06:00.027 --> 06:02.988
But from the ashes of destruction,

06:03.030 --> 06:05.783
I was the last survivor.

06:05.824 --> 06:10.079
I chose to pass my knowledge
on to only one.

06:10.121 --> 06:13.124
I created a legacy so resilient

06:13.165 --> 06:16.461
that now you come before me.

06:18.504 --> 06:21.673
Have you come
to be my apprentice?

06:21.715 --> 06:26.387
You must kill me to gain my place.

06:26.429 --> 06:29.265
Dead you are already.

06:31.976 --> 06:35.313
Then what stands before you?

06:35.354 --> 06:37.315
An illusion.

06:37.356 --> 06:39.649
Real you are not.

06:39.691 --> 06:42.278
You do not fear me?

06:42.320 --> 06:43.613
No.

06:43.653 --> 06:45.406
Exist you do not anymore.

06:47.074 --> 06:50.453
No!

06:55.082 --> 06:57.667
<i>Yoda...</i>

06:58.794 --> 07:00.963
<i>Yoda...</i>

07:26.864 --> 07:30.409
I sense we have
a great opportunity

07:30.451 --> 07:34.705
to strike a deadly blow
to the Jedi Order.

07:34.746 --> 07:39.126
But we must act swiftly.

08:15.746 --> 08:18.499
A warning I must give you.

08:18.541 --> 08:20.042
Yes.

08:20.084 --> 08:24.547
All your trials you have faced
have been our doing.

08:24.589 --> 08:27.508
And you have passed them well.

08:27.550 --> 08:31.845
But inside, there is a place
where we have no control,

08:31.887 --> 08:37.058
for it is a place
of absolute darkness.

08:37.101 --> 08:39.729
What happened here?

08:39.770 --> 08:43.774
It is the chamber where the Sith
would sacrifice Jedi.

08:43.815 --> 08:47.653
The Sith of your time
will find you there,

08:47.695 --> 08:50.698
and you will find them.

08:50.740 --> 08:53.033
Be careful,
for what they may offer

08:53.075 --> 08:57.037
will certainly
feel like an answer.

09:14.597 --> 09:18.309
Only the presence
of someone significant to you

09:18.350 --> 09:22.187
would allow you
to sense this ripple

09:22.229 --> 09:25.023
through time and space.

09:25.065 --> 09:27.693
My old master...

09:27.735 --> 09:29.027
Yoda.

09:29.069 --> 09:30.862
Yes.

09:30.904 --> 09:34.700
Master Yoda
has come to Moraband,

09:34.742 --> 09:38.203
although why, I do not know.

09:38.245 --> 09:39.580
We shall, however,

09:39.622 --> 09:42.541
use the strong bond
that once existed

09:42.583 --> 09:45.043
between you and your master

09:45.085 --> 09:50.716
to allow us to see things
that we otherwise could not.

09:50.758 --> 09:53.385
How can this be done,
Master?

09:53.427 --> 09:57.889
It is an old art
of the dark side.

09:57.931 --> 10:01.893
Now, hold out your hand,
Apprentice.

10:06.064 --> 10:10.778
I need but a drop
for the ritual to begin.

10:14.740 --> 10:21.413
Kintik hadzuska sutta chwituskak!

10:21.455 --> 10:24.667
Kintik hadzuska

10:24.709 --> 10:29.254
sutta chwituskak!

10:29.296 --> 10:34.635
Jiaasjen Jidai,
jiassjen Jidai!

10:37.095 --> 10:40.558
Now, concentrate
on Master Yoda.

10:40.599 --> 10:44.895
Bring all your focus to him.

10:44.936 --> 10:48.023
But will he not sense
our presence?

10:51.235 --> 10:55.406
We shall come to him
with a familiar face,

10:55.447 --> 10:58.075
a long-lost face,

10:58.116 --> 11:01.912
one he would be eager
to see again,

11:01.953 --> 11:06.375
one whom he would ask
and want answered

11:06.417 --> 11:11.088
all the questions he seeks.

11:20.389 --> 11:22.266
Help me.

11:24.309 --> 11:28.397
Please, please free me.

11:28.439 --> 11:30.900
Sifo-Dyas?

11:30.940 --> 11:32.818
Alive you are!

11:32.860 --> 11:37.072
Help me, please, Yoda.

11:37.114 --> 11:41.619
I have been imprisoned
for so long.

11:41.660 --> 11:43.995
Know who did this to you?

11:46.749 --> 11:52.003
What if I could tell you
who the Sith Lord is?

11:52.045 --> 11:55.048
Free me,
and I will reveal it.

11:55.090 --> 11:56.174
No!

11:57.760 --> 12:01.971
He knows how to achieve
what you seek.

12:02.013 --> 12:05.392
Captivated by
the physical realm the Sith are.

12:05.434 --> 12:07.352
What else is there?

12:07.394 --> 12:10.856
Free me,
and together we can know

12:10.898 --> 12:13.859
who the Sith Lord is,

12:13.901 --> 12:17.863
gain the power you deserve,

12:17.905 --> 12:19.949
and save the future.

12:19.989 --> 12:21.116
No.

12:21.158 --> 12:23.953
You must free me!

12:23.993 --> 12:26.622
Nothing to show me
the Sith have.

12:26.664 --> 12:29.708
We shall see.

12:37.215 --> 12:39.134
Sidious...

12:47.726 --> 12:49.186
There is no question.

12:49.227 --> 12:51.020
The ship was carrying Count Dooku.

12:51.062 --> 12:52.523
We've scanned the area,

12:52.564 --> 12:54.859
and he is meeting with someone
inside the building.

12:54.900 --> 12:58.696
Thanks, Rex.
Master Yoda, what are your orders?

12:58.737 --> 13:02.199
- Orders?
- Are you all right, Master?

13:02.240 --> 13:04.869
- Where am I?
- I don't understand.

13:04.910 --> 13:06.370
Tell me you must!

13:06.411 --> 13:08.873
The industrial sector on Coruscant.

13:08.914 --> 13:10.582
What is happening here?

13:10.624 --> 13:12.877
A rogue shuttle slipped
through the security grid.

13:12.918 --> 13:14.712
We suspect Dooku was on board.

13:14.753 --> 13:18.298
- And?
- Master, this is your mission.

13:18.340 --> 13:20.133
Are you sure you're all right?

13:20.175 --> 13:22.636
Clouded, the dark side
has made me.

13:22.678 --> 13:25.305
Tell me, who is inside?

13:25.347 --> 13:28.308
We intercepted a transmission
calling Dooku to Coruscant.

13:28.350 --> 13:30.811
We believe he is meeting
with his master,

13:30.853 --> 13:32.312
the Sith Lord.

13:32.354 --> 13:34.147
Feel it I do.

13:34.189 --> 13:36.316
Feel their power.

13:36.358 --> 13:38.318
Your orders, Master?

13:38.360 --> 13:39.653
Capture them we will.

13:39.695 --> 13:41.070
The time has come

13:41.112 --> 13:43.657
to discover the identity
of this Sith Master.

13:43.699 --> 13:45.325
And if they escape?

13:45.367 --> 13:46.827
Escape, not.

13:46.869 --> 13:48.996
If it comes to it...

13:49.038 --> 13:51.164
Execute them we must.

13:51.206 --> 13:53.876
End it now we will.

14:10.893 --> 14:12.770
Move in.

14:17.775 --> 14:19.693
I've got two confirmed targets.

14:19.735 --> 14:22.320
Be ready for additional
unfriendlies.

14:32.706 --> 14:35.333
It appears we have...

14:35.375 --> 14:36.710
company.

14:39.630 --> 14:41.172
Take 'em!

14:57.940 --> 15:01.359
We meet at last, Darth Sidious.

15:01.401 --> 15:05.864
You cannot stop what is to come.

15:16.374 --> 15:17.918
Skywalker, no!

16:14.058 --> 16:15.642
No!

17:00.896 --> 17:04.315
Save him, Jedi?

17:04.357 --> 17:06.234
Can you save him?

17:19.414 --> 17:21.750
Why not let him go?

17:21.791 --> 17:23.627
Let him die,

17:23.667 --> 17:27.923
and you can stop
all that I will do.

17:30.801 --> 17:32.261
No!

17:32.302 --> 17:35.764
The future is not yours yet.

17:35.806 --> 17:38.267
Tempted I will not be.

17:38.308 --> 17:42.271
Sacrifice all I am ready to do.

18:45.834 --> 18:50.255
We have failed to break
Master Yoda.

18:50.297 --> 18:52.590
He is strong.

18:52.632 --> 18:54.968
We will need more time

18:55.010 --> 18:58.638
if we are to defeat him and the Jedi.

19:01.558 --> 19:04.186
Yoda...

19:05.229 --> 19:08.481
Come back to us, Yoda.

19:09.858 --> 19:11.735
Died have I?

19:11.776 --> 19:14.779
In a way.

19:16.823 --> 19:19.743
Now does my training begin?

19:19.784 --> 19:22.537
The one you know as Qui-Gon Jinn

19:22.579 --> 19:25.540
will commune with you
and guide your training.

19:25.582 --> 19:28.835
Like us, you shall learn
to maintain your consciousness

19:28.877 --> 19:30.337
after death.

19:30.379 --> 19:35.342
Enlightenment, spirit,

19:35.384 --> 19:37.010
balance...

19:37.052 --> 19:40.555
<i>There is another Skywalker...</i>

19:40.597 --> 19:42.015
<i>There is another...</i>

19:42.057 --> 19:44.393
<i>Skywalker?</i>

19:56.696 --> 20:00.325
Yes, time to go home it is.

20:32.232 --> 20:34.192
The Council has assembled.

20:34.234 --> 20:37.279
They are eager to hear your report.

20:37.321 --> 20:41.325
Afraid not much there is
to say of my journey.

20:43.827 --> 20:46.746
So nothing significant
happened to you out there?

20:46.788 --> 20:49.291
Yes... and no.

20:49.333 --> 20:51.584
To the end we are coming now.

20:51.626 --> 20:55.922
Did your journey give you insight
on how to win the war?

20:55.964 --> 20:57.215
No longer certain

20:57.257 --> 21:00.927
that one ever does win a war I am.

21:00.969 --> 21:02.929
For in fighting the battles,

21:02.971 --> 21:07.058
the bloodshed already lost we have.

21:07.100 --> 21:10.895
Yet, open to us, a path remains

21:10.937 --> 21:13.606
that unknown to the Sith is.

21:13.648 --> 21:17.735
Through this path,
victory we may yet find.

21:17.777 --> 21:20.613
Not victory in the Clone Wars

21:20.655 --> 21:24.117
but victory for all time.

21:49.803 --> 21:54.486
