<i>NARRATOR".
When last we saw the Dynamic Duo...</i>

00:13.264 --> 00:17.310
<i>...they were in the Penguin's catapult
about to be launched over Gotham City...</i>

00:17.477 --> 00:21.022
<i>...and land like a pair of squashed tomatoes...</i>

00:21.189 --> 00:25.693
<i>...with Penguin's cameras set to record
their horrible death.</i>

00:25.860 --> 00:30.198
<i>We'll be back in 60 seconds
with the smashing climax.</i>

01:52.405 --> 01:55.617
Holy cliffhangers, Batman.
Aren't you even gonna try to get loose?

01:55.783 --> 01:59.120
- What's the cube root of pi?
-The cube root of pi? At a time like this?

01:59.287 --> 02:01.664
Never mind, I just remembered it.

02:01.998 --> 02:05.627
What are you doing? We're about to be
launched all the way across Gotham City.

02:05.793 --> 02:09.505
Exactly, Robin. I'm computing our trajectory.

02:09.672 --> 02:13.426
According to my computations,
we should land about 30 yards south...

02:13.593 --> 02:16.179
...of the intersection
of Mulberry and 7th Streets.

02:16.346 --> 02:18.723
And they'll need a blotter
to soak up our remains.

02:18.890 --> 02:20.224
As you'll recall, Robin...

02:20.642 --> 02:24.854
...I spent last week testing
the remote control unit of the Batmobile.

02:25.021 --> 02:28.274
- You have that gadget strapped to your wrist?
- Fortunately, yes.

02:28.441 --> 02:32.278
And we're about to give it the acid test.

02:42.246 --> 02:43.623
I've started it.

02:43.790 --> 02:48.920
Now to program it
to proceed to Mulberry and 7th Streets.

02:49.087 --> 02:50.129
Thirty yards south.

02:51.964 --> 02:54.509
Hurry, Batman.
In a few seconds, we'll be in midair.

02:58.137 --> 02:59.722
That's it, Robin.

03:00.139 --> 03:04.977
Now, let's hope the Batmobile
will get there...

03:05.186 --> 03:06.396
...before we do.

03:27.583 --> 03:30.211
Holy suborbit, Batman.
It's raining down there.

03:57.447 --> 04:01.743
All that time we spent on the remote-control
activator really reaped dividends, Robin.

04:01.909 --> 04:05.913
I'll say. Remind me to give the Batmobile
an extra quart of oil next time we change it.

04:06.080 --> 04:09.167
And now we have to get our hands
on a certain oily bird.

04:09.333 --> 04:12.879
We should see Commissioner Gordon
and Chief O'Hara at once.

04:31.647 --> 04:33.566
The nerve of that vulture.

04:33.733 --> 04:36.444
We'll catapult him right behind bars
where he belongs.

04:36.611 --> 04:40.072
We'll put him there eventually,
Chief O'Hara, but not just yet.

04:41.073 --> 04:42.241
Not yet?

04:42.408 --> 04:46.204
When he tried to smash the two of you
like a pair of ripe tomatoes?

04:46.370 --> 04:50.750
Unfortunately, he still has
the museum's priceless chain-mail armor...

04:50.917 --> 04:55.087
...made in the 15th century
by the great Benvenuto Violini...

04:55.254 --> 04:58.508
...out of a special alloy he also invented.

04:58.674 --> 05:00.676
Batman is right, Chief O'Hara.

05:00.843 --> 05:04.597
If we put Penguin behind bars now,
we'll never see that armor again.

05:04.764 --> 05:08.643
- And it could be hidden in a thousand places.
-How are we going to find it?

05:08.810 --> 05:10.770
I'm not so sure that stealing the armor...

05:10.937 --> 05:13.523
...is Penguin's overall plan, commissioner.

05:13.981 --> 05:16.484
It could be just a side caper.

05:16.651 --> 05:20.404
I think the first step might be
for Robin and me...

05:20.571 --> 05:23.199
...to resume our acting careers.

05:23.533 --> 05:25.493
You mean back to "lights, camera, action"?

05:25.660 --> 05:26.786
Exactly, Robin.

05:26.953 --> 05:30.957
That way we can get a clue
as to where Penguin's stashed the armor.

05:31.499 --> 05:33.668
Sure and he'll be suspicious, Batman.

05:33.835 --> 05:35.378
I hope he is, Chief O'Hara.

05:35.545 --> 05:40.424
Suspicion often provides surprises.

05:42.343 --> 05:47.515
And so my Caped Canaries, you have survived
your little flight through space...

05:47.682 --> 05:50.726
...and now you would like
to rejoin my film company, huh?

05:50.893 --> 05:53.521
Quack! What do you take me for, a fool?

05:53.688 --> 05:58.484
We're willing to forgive and forget, Penguin,
and help you finish the film.

05:58.651 --> 06:01.362
You don't fool me, Dynamic Double-Talker.

06:01.529 --> 06:04.407
There's some hideously honest motive
behind all this.

06:04.574 --> 06:06.659
You're trying to trick me, huh? Quack!

06:06.826 --> 06:08.911
Out of my office, quick. Out. Out.

06:09.078 --> 06:10.997
I'm sorry you feel that way, Penguin.

06:11.163 --> 06:14.458
If you're not out of my office
in 10 seconds, I'll call my bouncers.

06:14.625 --> 06:17.795
Then you'll really know how I feel.
Out. Move, move.

06:19.005 --> 06:22.216
And keep moving, you Cupcake Crusaders.

06:22.383 --> 06:24.719
You Dynamic Dingbats.

06:24.886 --> 06:26.095
Move!

06:26.262 --> 06:28.472
And stay out.

06:35.980 --> 06:38.858
This is terrible, Robin.

06:39.483 --> 06:41.736
I don't know what I'll do now.

06:42.069 --> 06:44.864
- You'll get over it, Batman.
-No, I won't...

06:45.031 --> 06:48.534
...old chum. I've been bitten by the bug.

06:48.701 --> 06:50.786
- Show biz?
-Yes.

06:50.953 --> 06:52.455
Yes, it's in my blood now.

06:53.080 --> 06:55.333
<i>I</i> wanna get <i>back in</i> front of <i>those</i> cameras.

06:55.499 --> 06:57.251
<i>I wanna see my name in lights.</i>

06:57.752 --> 06:59.420
"Batman."

06:59.587 --> 07:03.299
Headlines in the movie trade papers.

07:04.258 --> 07:07.303
<i>Big premieres. Academy Awards.</i>

07:08.930 --> 07:13.893
I'm afraid I've got it bad, Robin baby.

07:16.062 --> 07:20.274
The smell of the greasepaint,
the roar of the crowd.

07:20.942 --> 07:24.612
<i>I'd do anything
to get back in front of those cameras.</i>

07:24.779 --> 07:29.158
Quack. Oh, the Batman has show business
in his blood, huh?

07:29.325 --> 07:33.829
A beautiful chance to bake those two pigeons
in a Penguin pie.

07:38.584 --> 07:40.711
Now, watch things, Mac.

07:51.097 --> 07:52.807
I've changed my mind, Batman.

07:52.974 --> 07:55.309
I've decided you can act in my film after all.

07:55.476 --> 07:58.354
- You'll never know how much I appreciate this.
-it's nothing.

07:58.521 --> 08:00.523
I was once a struggling young actor myself.

08:00.690 --> 08:03.901
Now, he's the second part of the script.
Look it over, carefully.

08:04.068 --> 08:05.194
- Penguin?
-Uh-huh?

08:05.361 --> 08:07.697
<i>- I'll</i> never forget this.
<i>- I'll</i> say you won't.

08:14.954 --> 08:18.833
<i>NARRATOR". Meanwhile, in an isolated section
of Gotham Central Park...</i>

08:19.000 --> 08:23.337
<i>...Marsha and her aunt Hilda
are looking for elderly toads...</i>

08:23.504 --> 08:26.132
<i>...for Aunt Hilda's evil potion.</i>

08:26.298 --> 08:28.134
Aunt Hilda, what's wrong with that one?

08:28.300 --> 08:33.597
He's too young, dearie.
My potion requires a very old toad.

08:33.764 --> 08:35.683
How can you tell their age, anyway?

08:35.850 --> 08:39.145
There are ways, dearie. There are ways.

08:39.311 --> 08:41.480
Well, how long are we going to have to wait?

08:41.647 --> 08:43.899
Last time I waited two weeks.

08:44.066 --> 08:45.860
Oh, that's just dandy.

08:46.027 --> 08:49.280
Have you ever considered knitting, dearie?

08:49.447 --> 08:50.948
Wonderful pastime.

08:51.699 --> 08:54.744
Perhaps you should try and knit us
a few old toads, darling.

09:20.644 --> 09:24.982
Great acting job, Batman.
You could run for senator. Or governor.

09:25.149 --> 09:26.692
Thank you, Robin.

09:26.859 --> 09:31.989
Who knows, perhaps I do have a little touch
of show business in my blood.

09:32.156 --> 09:34.950
Holy history.
Penguin's gone from Rome to the Middle Ages.

09:35.117 --> 09:37.745
The second part of his script
is set in medieval England.

09:37.912 --> 09:39.455
It doesn't surprise me, Robin.

09:39.622 --> 09:43.125
The criminal mind is characteristically
erratic and unstable.

09:43.292 --> 09:47.296
And gullible. He fell for that act of yours
hook, line and sinker.

09:47.463 --> 09:52.218
Needless to say, old chum,
I don't like having to resort to such mendacity.

09:52.384 --> 09:56.597
But considering the circumstances,
I think it was justified.

09:56.764 --> 09:58.933
And considering
we still don't know his plan.

09:59.100 --> 10:00.976
Precisely.

10:13.072 --> 10:17.451
Heh, heh, that's right, Batman.
You stick with me, I'll make a star out of you.

10:17.618 --> 10:20.204
Don't worry, Penguin.

10:20.371 --> 10:22.498
I'll stick with you, all right.

10:26.335 --> 10:29.463
These suits of armor aren't part
of the museum collection, are they?

10:29.630 --> 10:32.466
No, Robin, this is quite ordinary armor.

10:32.633 --> 10:35.636
- Are we all set?
-Ready when you give the word, Pengy.

10:35.803 --> 10:37.346
Consider it given.

10:38.848 --> 10:42.017
I sure don't like being in this thing.
I can hardly move.

10:42.184 --> 10:43.269
Nor can I, Robin.

10:43.686 --> 10:46.147
But we must make Penguin think
we're cooperating.

10:46.313 --> 10:50.568
At least until we get some hint
as to where he's hidden the museum armor.

10:50.734 --> 10:55.781
And this kind of risk is part of our job
as crime fighters.

10:58.409 --> 11:02.663
Batman and Robin, we're all ready. Come here.

11:18.554 --> 11:20.097
It's a magnet, Batman.

11:20.264 --> 11:21.974
Try to wrench yourself free, Robin.

11:22.141 --> 11:23.642
Don't bother, Batman.

11:23.809 --> 11:28.022
That magnet has a 2-ton pull.
It'll take a locomotive to wrench you free.

11:28.189 --> 11:29.648
You underhanded weasel.

11:29.815 --> 11:33.277
Heh. Thanks for the compliment,
Boy Bigmouth.

11:33.444 --> 11:34.945
All right, men, hoist away.

11:37.072 --> 11:39.491
Well, Batman,
you said you wanted to stick with me...

11:39.658 --> 11:41.994
...and I arranged to have you stuck.

11:42.161 --> 11:44.955
I've also arranged
to have you demolished later.

11:45.122 --> 11:50.461
But right now I have a little appointment
with General MacGruder at the Hexagon.

11:50.628 --> 11:54.423
It seems the good general also has a yen
to be a movie actor.

11:55.799 --> 11:58.969
How would you like to see that
priceless armor? Would you like that, huh?

11:59.136 --> 12:00.512
All right, front and forward.

12:03.557 --> 12:06.268
There you are. My own armored division.

12:06.435 --> 12:08.520
Von Pengy's Blitzkrieg.

12:08.687 --> 12:13.108
Just wait till I get through
with those armchair generals at the Hexagon.

12:13.275 --> 12:16.528
All right, men. Forward march.

12:16.695 --> 12:22.785
One, two, three, four. One, two, three, quack.
One, two, three, quack, quack.

12:22.952 --> 12:24.912
Holy catastrophes, Batman.

12:25.079 --> 12:27.915
I'd sooner see the Russians in the Hexagon
than Penguin.

12:28.082 --> 12:29.375
We must stop him, Robin.

12:29.541 --> 12:33.921
The Generals at the Hexagon are capable men,
but they're trained in open warfare...

12:34.088 --> 12:36.924
...not the devious kind
that Penguin practices.

12:37.091 --> 12:41.011
See if you can find
some kind of loose joint...

12:41.178 --> 12:43.722
...or fitting.

12:43.889 --> 12:46.433
We must get out of these things.

12:50.688 --> 12:55.025
The Army is always happy to cooperate
with the motion-picture industry, Mr. Penguin.

12:55.192 --> 12:56.568
Always happy.

12:56.735 --> 13:00.364
And the Penguin is always happy to cooperate
with the Army, General MacGruder.

13:00.531 --> 13:01.615
It's a pleasure, sir.

13:01.782 --> 13:06.453
You, uh, did say that there might be a little part
in the picture for me, huh?

13:06.620 --> 13:08.163
A little part, sir?

13:08.330 --> 13:11.750
For a man of your acting ability,
there is a colossal part.

13:11.917 --> 13:14.712
It is two lines longer than Hamlet, sir.

13:15.087 --> 13:16.422
<i>Hamlet?</i>

13:16.588 --> 13:17.798
Well...

13:17.965 --> 13:20.759
Then you do think
I have some acting ability, huh?

13:20.926 --> 13:23.053
Oh, I think all generals do, sir.

13:23.220 --> 13:25.848
I think it's part of their equipment, like, uh...

13:26.015 --> 13:27.808
Like gills on a fish.

13:27.975 --> 13:29.727
- Agreed?
-True.

13:29.893 --> 13:34.315
Of course, if I may say so, sir,
I think you have far more than the average.

13:34.481 --> 13:37.901
Ability, sir. Not gills. Ha-ha-ha.

13:42.323 --> 13:45.117
I'm glad to hear you say that, Mr. Penguin.

13:45.284 --> 13:48.370
You see, I'm due to retire next year, and I--

13:48.537 --> 13:49.747
Next year?

13:49.913 --> 13:52.291
Just a moment. Would you turn your head
to one side, please?

13:52.458 --> 13:54.877
- Huh?
-Just turn your head, just a little, to one...

13:55.044 --> 13:57.004
<i>Oh, oh. Mm.</i>

13:58.047 --> 14:02.009
Ah, there. That is magnificent, that profile.
Tsk, tsk, tsk.

14:02.176 --> 14:03.927
I'm sure, sir, as an Army man...

14:04.094 --> 14:06.889
...you understand the importance
of winning battles.

14:07.639 --> 14:11.727
Well, in Hollywood, sir,
a profile like yours is half the battle.

14:11.894 --> 14:15.147
So when you retire,
do not sign with anybody else.

14:15.314 --> 14:21.070
Because Penguin Productions is prepared
to offer you an exclusive five-year contract.

14:21.236 --> 14:25.783
- Agreed?
-You have my word on it, Mr. Penguin.

14:25.949 --> 14:29.453
Very good, sir. And now, if you don't mind,
I'd like to get on with my film.

14:29.620 --> 14:32.873
I have a very tight shooting schedule, sir.

14:33.540 --> 14:35.334
Major Beasley.

14:40.923 --> 14:41.965
Yes, sir.

14:42.132 --> 14:44.843
MacGRUDER:
Mr. Penguin is shooting a very important film.

14:45.010 --> 14:47.262
I want you to give him
your utmost cooperation.

14:47.429 --> 14:48.472
Of course, sir.

14:48.639 --> 14:53.018
Now, if you gentlemen have no objection,
I'd like to shoot the first scene in Room X.

14:53.185 --> 14:56.438
Room X. Oh, but, sir, Room X is right--

14:56.605 --> 14:58.190
- That chin.
-What?

14:58.357 --> 15:00.192
Did you see that chin, general?

15:00.359 --> 15:03.821
That is magnificent. Ah? Ah?

15:03.987 --> 15:05.864
It works from either side.

15:06.031 --> 15:08.283
Well, now, tell me, what--?

15:08.450 --> 15:11.578
- When do you retire, major?
-In about five years, sir. Why?

15:11.745 --> 15:14.873
I want you to promise me
not to sign with any other producer.

15:15.040 --> 15:20.504
Because Penguin Productions is willing
to offer you an exclusive five-year contract.

15:20.671 --> 15:22.506
Oh, my goodness. Well...

15:23.173 --> 15:26.385
I thought you said you were going to sign me
to a five-year contract.

15:27.344 --> 15:28.595
Did I say that, general?

15:28.762 --> 15:31.223
- Yes.
- I must be out of my mind.

15:31.557 --> 15:34.726
We want you for a 10-year contract.

15:36.228 --> 15:37.688
Now, about Room X.

15:38.021 --> 15:39.565
I, uh, ahem...

15:39.731 --> 15:41.525
...think that might be arranged.

15:41.692 --> 15:42.985
- Huh, major?
-Hmm?

15:43.152 --> 15:45.779
- Oh, yes, sir. Of course, sir. I agree, sir.
-I knew it.

15:45.946 --> 15:48.782
I knew the Army would never let me down.

15:58.375 --> 16:02.880
Well, from the way you two gentlemen talked,
I thought this room would be full of top secrets.

16:03.046 --> 16:05.340
But it looks like a perfectly
ordinary room to me.

16:05.507 --> 16:08.594
Oh, it's quite ordinary, sir.
But Room X connects with Room Y.

16:08.760 --> 16:12.139
And Room Y connects with Room Z.

16:12.306 --> 16:13.432
And inside Room Z--

16:13.599 --> 16:16.810
- Uh, I think that's enough, major.
-Yes, sir. Sorry about that.

16:16.977 --> 16:18.645
I'd better get this scene started.

16:18.812 --> 16:21.773
Is it all right if I call my finks--?
I mean, my crew in now?

16:21.940 --> 16:25.152
- Why, certainly. Certainly, Mr. Penguin.
-All right, crew, come on in.

16:28.739 --> 16:33.118
- Why, I don't understand this, Mr. Penguin.
-Sorry, general, that's show business.

16:33.285 --> 16:36.330
All right, men, Room Z is the one we want.
Through that door.

16:37.873 --> 16:40.751
- MacGRUDER: Stop! Stop!
- Quack, quack, quack.

16:40.918 --> 16:42.503
They're heading for Room Z.

16:42.669 --> 16:44.922
Beasley, call the cavalry.

16:45.088 --> 16:47.257
Sir, we haven't had any cavalry since 1910.

16:47.424 --> 16:50.302
- Oh. Well, call the Army.
-Yes--

16:50.469 --> 16:51.470
Sir, we are the Army.

16:51.637 --> 16:54.681
Well, get some men up here.
Don't just stand there.

16:54.848 --> 16:56.934
Yes, sir. Men. Men. Men!

17:02.523 --> 17:03.857
Room Z at last.

17:04.023 --> 17:05.192
Watch the door, boys.

17:05.358 --> 17:08.904
Now find the little item we want
and we'll get out of here.

17:14.952 --> 17:16.286
Here they are, boys.

17:16.453 --> 17:18.204
Remember the Alamo, MacGruder.

17:18.372 --> 17:22.041
Remember Custer--
No, no, let's forget Custer.

17:22.209 --> 17:23.919
Remember Grant and Lee...

17:24.086 --> 17:27.089
...and Teddy Roosevelt
charging up San Juan Hill.

17:27.256 --> 17:30.801
That's it. Remember Teddy Roosevelt.

17:31.051 --> 17:32.511
Beasley, where are those men?

17:32.678 --> 17:35.472
Right here, sir. Come on, men. Hurry.

17:36.181 --> 17:38.600
All right, men. This is it.

17:38.767 --> 17:40.727
Fix bayonets.

17:41.395 --> 17:43.021
Now, we're going to charge up that hill--

17:43.188 --> 17:46.441
Uh, through that door
and capture the enemy.

17:46.608 --> 17:49.987
All right, men? Charge.

17:59.580 --> 18:03.166
Fire if you must, men,
but protect your leader.

18:05.794 --> 18:09.006
Their chain armor seems to be impervious
to our lead.

18:09.172 --> 18:12.509
After them, men. Charge!

18:18.932 --> 18:21.643
Gosh, Batman,
there are no chinks in this armor.

18:21.810 --> 18:23.437
No.

18:23.604 --> 18:26.982
But I happened to find a loose fastening,
Robin.

18:27.149 --> 18:29.568
- You mean you can get out of your suit?
-No, Robin.

18:29.735 --> 18:32.904
But remember,
this magnet is powered by electricity.

18:33.071 --> 18:34.990
Pfft. What good does that do us?

18:35.699 --> 18:38.827
It depends on how good my aim is...

18:38.994 --> 18:44.916
...and whether someone
left that empty lamp plugged in.

18:45.083 --> 18:47.044
That's an impossible shot, Batman.

18:47.210 --> 18:50.797
That's a negative attitude, Robin.

18:54.968 --> 18:57.638
Holy bull's-eye, Batman.

19:03.268 --> 19:07.272
Beautiful, Batman. You shorted out the fuse box
and cut off the power to the magnet.

19:07.439 --> 19:10.359
No time to congratulate ourselves, Robin.

19:10.525 --> 19:12.611
We must get down to the Hexagon.

19:12.778 --> 19:13.987
In these things?

19:14.154 --> 19:17.616
We can't waste precious minutes
getting out of them.

19:36.968 --> 19:39.096
Shoot for their tires.

19:43.100 --> 19:44.393
They got away, sir.

19:44.559 --> 19:46.144
We have no choice, Beasley.

19:46.311 --> 19:48.772
- Call the Air Force.
-Yes, sir.

19:49.064 --> 19:50.107
Sir.

19:50.273 --> 19:54.277
Sir, I think we may have something better
than the Air Force.

19:57.989 --> 20:00.409
The Dynamic Duo. Thank heavens.

20:00.575 --> 20:02.911
What are you doing in those suits of armor,
Batman?

20:03.078 --> 20:05.414
-It's a long story, major.
-Never mind.

20:05.580 --> 20:10.168
The Penguin penetrated Room Z
and made off with-- With who knows what.

20:10.335 --> 20:13.463
Whatever it is,
we'll do our best to get it back.

20:18.260 --> 20:20.387
They may not be the Air Force, major...

20:20.554 --> 20:24.474
...but they're the closest thing to it
in Gotham City.

20:25.225 --> 20:27.102
Yes, they are, sir.

20:39.239 --> 20:41.116
Should we use the Batzooka, Batman?

20:41.283 --> 20:42.993
I don't think we'll need it, Robin.

20:43.160 --> 20:45.871
As usual,
Penguin has overlooked a vital fact.

20:46.037 --> 20:49.291
That truck he's driving
is too light to support all that armor.

20:49.458 --> 20:54.212
One more high-speed turn,
and I'm sure his tires will go.

20:54.379 --> 20:56.631
Lucky we have heavy-duties
on the Batmobile.

21:03.263 --> 21:04.681
You were right, Batman.

21:04.848 --> 21:08.101
That last turn flattened
one of Penguin's tires.

21:19.988 --> 21:21.948
Through the alley, you finks.

21:34.044 --> 21:35.796
Take this back to the hideout.

21:35.962 --> 21:37.923
I'll hold off the Clanking Crusaders.

22:16.127 --> 22:20.799
Now you're in the trash heap
where you belong, Dynamic Dodos.

22:31.434 --> 22:32.644
What's that mess?

22:32.811 --> 22:34.980
Oh, just a...

22:35.689 --> 22:37.190
...pile of old junk.

22:37.357 --> 22:38.942
Wait a minute.

22:40.110 --> 22:42.988
What'll you charge me
to haul that stuff away?

22:43.154 --> 22:45.198
- Five bucks.
-What do you do with it?

22:45.365 --> 22:48.076
Mash it up in a hydraulic press
and sell it for scrap.

22:48.243 --> 22:51.788
Ha-ha-ha. The Scrapped Crusaders.
That's magnificent.

22:51.955 --> 22:54.708
- What do you mean by that?
-Never mind. Here, here.

22:54.875 --> 22:57.377
Here's 5 bucks. I want you to haul that away.

22:57.544 --> 22:59.546
Wait a minute. Here's another 5.

22:59.713 --> 23:02.966
Mash it down hard, huh? Ha-ha-ha.
