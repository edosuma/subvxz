Once upon a time, in a village far away,

00:05.880 --> 00:10.093
lived a group called the Trolls
that celebrated almost every day.

00:10.176 --> 00:11.177
Hey, that's a rhyme!

00:11.261 --> 00:13.555
The Trolls had holidays up the wazoo!

00:13.638 --> 00:17.767
From Bubble Day to New Hairs Eve,
just to name a few.

00:17.851 --> 00:18.935
[all] Yay!

00:19.019 --> 00:23.606
Enjoying holiday after holiday,
they partied without stopping.

They celebrated everything
with their leader, Queen Poppy.

[all] Poppy! Poppy! Poppy!

00:28.361 --> 00:31.281
But across the way, in old Bergen Town,

00:31.364 --> 00:35.452
lived a group called the Bergens
whose spirits were down.

00:35.535 --> 00:38.955
They had but one holiday
that brought happiness.

00:39.039 --> 00:43.877
A tradition of eating Trolls
on a day called Trollstice.

00:43.960 --> 00:48.423
Then Poppy taught them
that joy was inside all along!

00:48.506 --> 00:53.928
So they got rid of Trollstice,
and their only holiday was gone.

00:54.012 --> 00:57.307
And so, on Trollstice Eve in Bergen Town,

00:57.390 --> 01:01.019
the Bergens, well,
now they're just kind of sitting around.
