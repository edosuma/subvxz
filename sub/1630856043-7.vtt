02:47.917 --> 02:49.878
I don't know, Chastity,
maybe they're traumatized.

02:49.961 --> 02:51.546
They did see you lose a tooth.

02:51.629 --> 02:53.340
Shit, I'm traumatized too.

02:53.423 --> 02:55.258
Your replacement looks

02:55.591 --> 02:56.718
It's perfect.

02:56.801 --> 02:59.721
Man, you need to let this shit go.
It's clearly not for your ass.

03:08.897 --> 03:09.814
Too soon, Mia.

03:09.898 --> 03:12.984
You need to get us a music bag
while we still relevant.

03:14.694 --> 03:16.446
What's the holdup with the music anyway?

03:16.529 --> 03:18.865
There is no new music
'cause we don't have beats.

03:18.948 --> 03:20.784
We don't even have a place
to record right now.

03:20.867 --> 03:23.661
And Francois not even fucking with me.
He's not responding.

03:29.751 --> 03:31.461
Mia, I thought you was gonna hit Lamont.

03:33.171 --> 03:34.714
This nigga keeps saying the studio booked.

03:35.507 --> 03:37.634
Then he keep saying he gon' send
some beats, and then he don't.

03:37.716 --> 03:39.678
I'm not finna keep begging that nigga.
Shit.

03:39.761 --> 03:42.555
You've been calling him broke for so long,
he probably ain't fucking with you.

03:42.639 --> 03:44.265
'Cause he been fucking broke. Shit.

03:44.349 --> 03:45.684
You know how broke I am, Chastity?

03:45.767 --> 03:47.602
I just got myself

03:47.686 --> 03:49.103

03:49.187 --> 03:50.313

03:50.397 --> 03:51.606
Lemme see if i could talk to him.

03:51.690 --> 03:54.025
But you got to keep it
professional with him.

03:54.109 --> 03:55.944
Oh, my God.
Guys, we need to focus up.

03:56.027 --> 03:59.114
We haven't done shit since the tour.
We made zero progress.

03:59.489 --> 04:02.158

04:03.284 --> 04:05.537
Chastity.
We know how hard-working you are.

04:05.620 --> 04:07.080
We know how smart you are.

04:07.163 --> 04:08.540
You get shit done.

04:08.915 --> 04:11.418
But just imagine
if you took all the energy

04:11.501 --> 04:14.254
you was using over there
and brought it over here.

04:14.921 --> 04:15.964
I hear you.

04:16.380 --> 04:18.507
I'ma hit that A&R chick
from the Billboard party.

04:18.591 --> 04:20.760
She out here for a week doing some event.

04:22.929 --> 04:23.972

04:37.402 --> 04:38.361
-It was good.
-Yeah?

04:38.445 --> 04:40.238
I did a pike on the trampoline, Mama.

04:40.321 --> 04:42.657
-You did?
-But Melissa can't do a pike.

04:42.741 --> 04:43.992
She kept falling.

04:44.075 --> 04:45.577
Girl, stop the cap.

04:45.659 --> 04:47.495
That's okay. I'm sure you did amazing.

04:47.579 --> 04:48.455
Hey.

04:48.955 --> 04:50.206
Thank you for picking 'em up.

04:50.290 --> 04:53.168
I had to get all these orders
out on time.

04:53.251 --> 04:54.544
No problem.

04:54.627 --> 04:57.839
They just wanted a little snack
before we came to the house.

04:57.922 --> 05:00.091
-Now you know better.
-What?

05:00.175 --> 05:01.051
Okay. They begged me.

05:01.760 --> 05:03.094
Plus, I got you a cookie.

05:03.470 --> 05:06.264
It ain't as sweet as your cookie,
of course.

05:06.348 --> 05:07.682
Come here. Look at you.

05:07.766 --> 05:09.517
You going to the studio today?

05:09.601 --> 05:11.686
-My session got canceled.
-Really?

05:12.562 --> 05:14.022
I'm trying to have a play date.

05:14.105 --> 05:15.190

05:15.732 --> 05:19.152
You being real bold right now,
acting like they're not in the other room.

05:19.235 --> 05:20.445

I mean, they gon' see it sooner or later.

05:25.700 --> 05:27.619

05:58.358 --> 06:00.402
So you must really like a nigga, huh?

06:03.655 --> 06:04.739
Alright.

06:05.448 --> 06:06.324

dropping off Melissa.

06:16.126 --> 06:17.210
Nada.

06:18.003 --> 06:20.505
I think he's still mad about that LA shit.

06:20.588 --> 06:22.757
-Niggas.
-Wait.

06:23.258 --> 06:26.219
Why do we care? Did I miss something?

06:28.888 --> 06:31.933
Girl, what the fuck is that?
You beatboxing now?

06:32.267 --> 06:34.686
Not good.
At least not since I got my tonsils out.

06:34.769 --> 06:38.189
But I asked the internet for beats for us,
so now I'm just going through them.

06:38.815 --> 06:39.941
Wait, wait, wait. Hold up.

06:41.234 --> 06:44.362
You said that he don't come inside,
so then where do he stand?

06:44.446 --> 06:47.198
Okay, so if this the door, okay,

06:47.282 --> 06:48.199

06:48.825 --> 06:50.368
Right there.

06:51.411 --> 06:52.454
Oh, no.

06:53.496 --> 06:54.748

06:56.791 --> 06:59.544
You know what?
Hey, Radio Raheem.

07:00.170 --> 07:02.630
Can you please cut that
lunch table-ass beat off?

07:02.714 --> 07:04.257
It sucks, right? It's bad.

07:04.341 --> 07:05.633
Well?

07:06.259 --> 07:07.552

He's setting boundaries.

07:19.022 --> 07:20.440
That sound like a girlfriend to me.

07:24.694 --> 07:27.155
No, no. Yeah.
I'ma have to hit Francois again.

07:27.238 --> 07:28.698
All these beats are trash.

07:33.578 --> 07:35.038
Just like Lamont's new bitch.

07:35.121 --> 07:36.206
-Yeah.
-Yep.

07:36.289 --> 07:39.793
Look, if you got questions,
just ask Melissa.

07:40.293 --> 07:41.670
She'll tell you if he got a girl.

07:42.295 --> 07:44.381
Hell, use them kids. Shit, I do.

07:44.464 --> 07:47.467
All of my kids got shit in they name.
Credit will be fine when they get 18.

07:50.428 --> 07:53.014
Can't stop, won't stop, nigga, yeah

07:53.098 --> 07:55.475

07:58.395 --> 08:00.105

08:00.939 --> 08:02.857
I'm the one who killed
Lil' Foolie and what?

08:05.819 --> 08:08.029
Suck my dick, bitch,
I'm too rich to drive a Range Rover

08:08.113 --> 08:10.699

08:15.412 --> 08:16.830
-What's up?

08:17.414 --> 08:18.456
-I'm so happy you came.
-Hey.

08:18.540 --> 08:20.750
-Thanks for inviting me.
-Of course.

08:20.834 --> 08:22.919
I couldn't come to town and not see you.

08:24.587 --> 08:27.632
This is wild out here.

08:27.716 --> 08:29.759
This whole space theme, I love it.

08:29.843 --> 08:31.886
You know that nigga Pluto
was outside trying to get in.

08:33.138 --> 08:34.264
Red Bull's the sponsor?

08:35.515 --> 08:38.393
Well, our marketing team was in charge
of putting together the activation,

08:38.476 --> 08:42.022
and my division was in charge
of putting together the film soundtrack.

08:42.105 --> 08:44.816
Oh, shit. So y'all like 360 with it?

08:45.108 --> 08:46.401
I'm really proud of it.

08:46.484 --> 08:48.611
Well, you know,
Shawna cold with the songwriting.

08:48.695 --> 08:50.030
She's sick with the pen.

08:50.113 --> 08:51.948
She can write anything for whoever.

08:52.032 --> 08:54.242
And Mia, she raw with the delivery.

08:54.325 --> 08:55.493
Good with the catchy hooks, too.

08:55.577 --> 09:00.123
I listened to the tracks you sent me,
and they're so good.

09:00.206 --> 09:02.208
-Word?
-I work out to them both.

09:03.251 --> 09:06.713
Well, right now, we working on an EP,
and, you know, I know Red Bull,

09:06.796 --> 09:08.381

09:08.465 --> 09:12.302
Hey, I want to introduce you to my boss.
His name is Kirk. He's the SVP of A&R.

09:12.969 --> 09:13.970
-Oh, shit. Yeah.
-Yeah?

09:14.054 --> 09:15.055
-Let's do it.
-Okay, come on.

09:19.434 --> 09:20.435
-Hey, Kirk.
-Hey.

09:20.518 --> 09:22.270
This is Chastity.

09:22.354 --> 09:24.564
She's a talent manager here in Miami,

09:24.647 --> 09:27.025
and her group just got off
their first tour,

09:27.108 --> 09:28.902
which she funded personally.

09:29.652 --> 09:30.653
Look at that.

09:31.404 --> 09:33.239
I love Miami. I'm out here all the time.

09:33.323 --> 09:35.575
Oh, word? You got to hit me
next time you come back,

09:35.658 --> 09:37.452
I can show you a good time.

09:37.535 --> 09:39.996
I know this one spot.
They got hookah, brunch, and bowling.

09:41.331 --> 09:43.958
Okay.
So how was the tour, Chastity?

09:44.042 --> 09:45.293
It's hard work, huh?

09:45.377 --> 09:48.380
Listen, tell me about it.
You want to write a movie about that?

09:48.880 --> 09:51.758
'Cause I can write that whole script
with my eyes closed.

09:53.259 --> 09:56.304
Yeah, one of our artists is kicking off
their third tour out here next month,

09:56.388 --> 09:59.057
so I'm dreading it already,
between you and me.

09:59.140 --> 10:00.684
It never gets easier, you know?

10:00.767 --> 10:02.143
For real.

10:02.227 --> 10:05.897
As long as they not the opening act
to the opening act, I can handle that.

10:05.980 --> 10:08.942
It's some cities
I don't never want to see again.

10:13.780 --> 10:15.740
Girl, why you being so
heavy-handed with that cheese?

10:15.824 --> 10:17.283
You gon' be lighting it up in here.

10:19.869 --> 10:22.414
So, let's talk. How's school been?

10:23.081 --> 10:23.957
Fine.

10:24.040 --> 10:25.166
M'kay.

10:25.875 --> 10:27.335
You been having fun with your daddy?

10:27.419 --> 10:28.795
Yup.

10:28.878 --> 10:31.756
So what kind of stuff y'all be doing?

10:32.173 --> 10:36.678
Sometimes we go out to eat, you know?
We go to the park.

10:36.761 --> 10:38.346
We even went to the seaquarium

10:38.430 --> 10:39.931
but left early

10:40.015 --> 10:43.435
because little Miss Lulu
got scared of the manatees.

10:43.518 --> 10:46.521
Lulu. So y'all had another play date?

10:46.855 --> 10:49.983
That's what I said. We friends and all.

10:50.066 --> 10:54.070
But I need some me time.
My name is Me-lissa. Okay?

10:54.154 --> 10:56.906
She get on my nerves too much.

10:56.990 --> 11:00.493
That's why I told her she not
invited to my birthday party.

11:00.577 --> 11:04.164
I mean, it's your birthday,
so whatever you want, of course.

11:04.247 --> 11:05.415
Okurr. Periodt.

11:08.376 --> 11:09.252
So

11:10.378 --> 11:11.838

11:11.921 --> 11:13.465
Like, y'all be going over to her house?

11:14.132 --> 11:15.383
Yeah.

11:18.011 --> 11:19.262
Am I in trouble?

11:19.346 --> 11:22.182
No, girl. We just talking.
Bonding, you know?

11:24.184 --> 11:27.187
So, what's your daddy be
doing when he be over there?

11:27.270 --> 11:31.191
I don't know.
But he need to stop tickling her.

11:32.317 --> 11:35.278
I be hearing her giggle,
giggle, giggle, giggle.

11:41.659 --> 11:42.660
Ticklish.

11:47.415 --> 11:48.540
Giggling, huh?

11:52.379 --> 11:56.216
Pussy, I'm a thug-ass gangsta bitch,

11:56.299 --> 11:59.552
Welcome to the grand
opening of Mixxy!

11:59.636 --> 12:01.721
Thug-ass gangsta bitch,

12:01.805 --> 12:03.556
And yo nigga know

12:03.640 --> 12:04.849

12:04.933 --> 12:06.351
I'm a thug-ass gangsta bitch...

12:11.356 --> 12:13.066
Fighting off them oppressors

12:13.149 --> 12:14.067
Fighting off

12:14.150 --> 12:15.443
I wanted to talk to you as a friend.

12:16.945 --> 12:20.073
Okay, friend. Where you been at?
I've been blowing your phone up.

12:20.156 --> 12:21.324
I know.

12:22.033 --> 12:23.243
I know. It's just

12:23.868 --> 12:25.328
Shawna,

12:25.412 --> 12:28.707
the Lord AK shit
really fucked me up. Okay?

12:29.082 --> 12:30.750
-I had to retreat.
-Yeah.

12:31.251 --> 12:34.045
It really fucked me up, too.
I thought I was the only one.

12:35.380 --> 12:38.383
I retreated into myself too,
like, really spent some time--

12:38.466 --> 12:39.926
Oh, no, I went to Maui.

12:40.593 --> 12:43.430
Yeah, I stopped smoking.
I can't even look at lighters.

12:43.513 --> 12:45.890
Francois.
Are you deadass right now?

12:45.974 --> 12:49.019
Not being high all the time,
it really gives you clarity.

12:50.645 --> 12:54.024
Pissing niggas off is my joy.
But at what cost?

12:54.107 --> 12:56.067
I didn't get into music to do this shit.

12:56.609 --> 12:58.528
I want to do some shit that I believe in.

13:00.405 --> 13:01.489
That's why I dropped Reina.

13:02.991 --> 13:05.368
What? Are you being serious?

13:05.452 --> 13:06.578
I'm deadass.

13:07.037 --> 13:08.413
Nigga, what happened?

13:08.496 --> 13:09.664
I'm selling her back to the label.

13:09.748 --> 13:12.500
She got all these new niggas in her ear
telling her this, that, and the other.

13:12.584 --> 13:13.793
I'm just tired of course correcting

13:13.877 --> 13:15.587
every single fucking time
that I talk to her.

13:15.670 --> 13:17.047
It's like when they say,
you know, when the shit

13:17.130 --> 13:18.965
is bigger than the cat,
you got to put that shit down.

13:19.049 --> 13:20.008
You got to kill the cat.

13:20.091 --> 13:21.843
-The cat is a bitch.
-Damn.

13:21.926 --> 13:23.720
And the cat has crooked parts
in its cornrows.

13:23.803 --> 13:25.930
Okay. Look, Shawna. I know you.

13:26.014 --> 13:28.850
I understand Mia.
I don't got to mold y'all.

13:28.933 --> 13:31.353
I don't got to shape y'all.
Y'all already did all that work.

13:32.604 --> 13:35.940
So together,
we can take this shit to the next level.

13:37.567 --> 13:38.735
Okay, how?

13:39.319 --> 13:40.570
I want to produce your EP.

13:41.529 --> 13:42.572
Officially.

13:44.115 --> 13:45.367
Okay. Okay.

13:45.450 --> 13:46.910
But we don't want to sit
in the passenger seat.

13:46.993 --> 13:48.745
-Alright.
-And we don't want to sit still

13:48.828 --> 13:50.538
and wait for shit, like,
we want to have a say.

13:50.622 --> 13:51.581
Alright.

13:51.664 --> 13:54.376
And if you really want to do this,
you got to get us a deal.

13:54.459 --> 13:55.835
That will take time,

13:55.919 --> 13:58.797
and there will be steps
that we have to make.

13:59.798 --> 14:00.924
But I could do that shit.

14:02.008 --> 14:03.176
Can I trust you?

14:03.635 --> 14:04.844
Like, seriously trust you?

14:04.928 --> 14:06.221
Yes.

14:07.472 --> 14:08.723
Can I trust you?

14:09.140 --> 14:11.267
No more back and forth. No more breaks.

14:13.186 --> 14:16.231
Nobody stands in our way.

14:16.314 --> 14:18.191
It's time to drop the dead weight.

14:18.274 --> 14:19.859
We do whatever it takes to win.

14:27.951 --> 14:30.161
I don't know, man, I just thought
you would take me somewhere

14:30.245 --> 14:31.454
a little more fancier than this.

14:31.538 --> 14:33.748
What? This your city.

14:33.832 --> 14:35.667
-You could have said something.
-Man!

14:35.750 --> 14:39.170
I don't know, it was nice having somebody
take charge. So I thought.

14:40.088 --> 14:42.257
Let me find out
you like a woman to take the lead.

14:44.259 --> 14:46.511
Yeah.
Not when they lead me to the ghetto.

14:47.887 --> 14:49.806
Shit, how you even know about this place?

14:49.889 --> 14:52.642
I ain't been here since I was, like, 21.

14:52.726 --> 14:55.854
Okay, okay. I'll do better next time.

14:58.940 --> 15:00.316
Nah, I'm just playin', man.

15:00.400 --> 15:02.152
I don't really be expecting shit,
for real.

15:02.235 --> 15:03.361
No?

15:04.863 --> 15:06.906
So, are you in a relationship?

15:06.990 --> 15:08.575
Oh, damn!

15:08.658 --> 15:10.368
Nah, man. Hell, nah.

15:10.452 --> 15:11.995
I ain't in no damn relationship,
definitely.

15:12.078 --> 15:15.248
I ain't been in no relationship
since I was in, like, the seventh grade.

15:16.708 --> 15:18.126
That's out.

15:20.670 --> 15:22.422
Not like that, bro. Listen, listen.

15:22.964 --> 15:25.008
I don't really do relationships.

15:25.342 --> 15:26.885
I be focused on my money.

15:32.432 --> 15:33.975
Right on time!

15:34.059 --> 15:35.852
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

15:35.935 --> 15:36.811
Yeah.

15:37.312 --> 15:38.855
Thank you.

15:38.938 --> 15:42.442
So, I was listening to some of the artists
that you've been tracking.

15:43.777 --> 15:46.613
They got they, like, own sound.
It's different.

15:47.280 --> 15:50.492
That's why I like Mia and Shawna.
They don't sound like anyone else.

15:50.909 --> 15:52.202
They don't even sound like each other.

15:53.536 --> 15:54.913
So you think they'll be interested?

15:55.747 --> 15:56.873
-Duke.
-'Cause you know, we finna start

15:56.956 --> 15:58.208
looking into deals.

15:59.334 --> 16:00.794
Like, we just want to go somewhere...

16:00.877 --> 16:01.753
Hello.

16:01.836 --> 16:04.714
...where they care,
you know what I'm saying?

16:04.798 --> 16:06.424
Or somewhere where they
can do they own thing.

16:07.050 --> 16:07.926
You know?

16:08.009 --> 16:10.762
Well, that's really important to us.
We don't want to change the artists.

16:10.845 --> 16:14.057
We just want to support them.
What do you have in mind for them?

16:14.140 --> 16:16.226
-So what happened, Duke?
-Oh, shit.

16:16.309 --> 16:18.061
I thought we was gon'
get this money together.

16:19.020 --> 16:20.855
If you didn't want me,
you could have just said that.

16:21.815 --> 16:23.483
-Melanie.
-Melody.

16:23.817 --> 16:24.693
As in "Dick."

16:25.652 --> 16:27.570
I told you I had the best
mouth of the South

16:28.321 --> 16:29.823
and I never heard from you again.

16:29.906 --> 16:31.282
Is you scared of a little baby?

16:31.366 --> 16:34.327
Best Mouth of the South.
That's what her fans call her.

16:34.869 --> 16:36.955
I actually got to re-listen to your music.

16:37.038 --> 16:39.665
What happened to
"Oh, when Lil' Durk come to town,

16:39.749 --> 16:40.750
I'ma put you on"?

16:40.834 --> 16:42.377
You know what? I got your Instagram.

16:42.460 --> 16:44.546
-Okay?
-So I'ma hit you,

16:44.629 --> 16:45.755
and we gon' work all this out.

16:45.839 --> 16:47.465
Right now,
I'm just in the middle of something.

16:47.549 --> 16:50.010
But listen, Melody, I got you.

16:50.093 --> 16:51.302
-Okay.
-I got you.

16:51.386 --> 16:54.347
Well, don't play.
'Cause I can find you again.

16:54.431 --> 16:56.766
-Thank you. Thank you so much.
-You're welcome.

16:56.850 --> 16:57.851
Next.

16:58.727 --> 17:01.604
She got fans.
They probably finna go take selfies.

17:01.688 --> 17:03.398
Am I gonna need my mace

17:03.481 --> 17:05.400
-when I hang out with you?
-No, I'm sorry.

17:05.483 --> 17:07.986
It's crazy though,
'cause I'm actually happy I ran into her.

17:08.069 --> 17:09.445
'Cause, you know,
they don't really be supporting

17:09.529 --> 17:11.239
the pregnant artists nowadays, you know?

17:11.321 --> 17:13.157
Mouth of the South is kind of fire,
though.

17:30.050 --> 17:31.968
Why do niggas love
to play the fuckin' victim?

17:32.052 --> 17:33.803
There be so much fucking dirt
on your hands,

17:33.887 --> 17:35.764
but it's everybody else fault.

17:37.307 --> 17:40.352
It's so easy for you to talk shit
when you safe.

17:40.935 --> 17:43.188
But if you back me
into a motherfucking corner,

17:43.271 --> 17:45.231
I'm leaving everybody bloody.

17:46.191 --> 17:47.567
I promise you that.

17:51.237 --> 17:53.239
That's my favorite shawty,
that's my favorite freak

17:53.323 --> 17:54.240

17:59.996 --> 18:01.456
-Nigga, that shit gold!
-Yeah.

18:01.539 --> 18:02.832
Let a nigga get a verse or something.

18:02.916 --> 18:04.167
Bruh, every song?

18:04.250 --> 18:05.919
-I got ideas.
-It don't need you.

18:06.002 --> 18:07.545
I say it every time.

18:07.629 --> 18:09.631
Man, well, you act like
you don't hear me, nigga.

18:09.714 --> 18:11.966
-I know I be enunciating.
-Oh, my God.

18:12.050 --> 18:14.803
Bro, the melodies that you did
on the background vocals,

18:16.012 --> 18:17.597

Curtis, Stevie, all that shit.

18:28.441 --> 18:30.026
-Like classic shit.
-Yeah.

18:30.110 --> 18:31.820

Yo, I'm just happy that you let me

18:57.762 --> 18:59.848
-Yeah. Yeah.
-You know.

18:59.931 --> 19:02.058
Man, the attention's been crazy, for real.

19:02.976 --> 19:04.561
They want me to talk about what happened.

19:04.644 --> 19:06.604
Yeah, niggas been hitting me too.

On the hook.

19:21.327 --> 19:23.663
I like females. What you thinking?

19:25.707 --> 19:28.585
Girl, Lamont just asked me
to come to the studio

19:28.668 --> 19:29.627
with him and Courtney.

19:30.754 --> 19:33.214
Wait. Courtney-Courtney?
Bitch, is that a set-up?

19:33.298 --> 19:34.841
Set-up? Courtney don't talk to me.

19:34.924 --> 19:37.093
Lamont don't talk to me.
Fuck they want with me?

19:37.177 --> 19:39.387
-Choo-choo!
-Bitch!

19:39.471 --> 19:41.765
Okay, I'm sorry. I'm joking.
But they can't be mad at you.

19:43.058 --> 19:44.434
Lamont definitely can't be mad.

19:44.517 --> 19:46.394
I just found out that
he fucking Melissa friend mama.

19:46.478 --> 19:48.313
Bitch, did you actually ask Melissa?

19:48.396 --> 19:50.231
Yeah. How else was I supposed
to get the answers?

19:50.315 --> 19:52.484
Over there fucking a bitch we both know.

19:52.567 --> 19:54.486
I wish he would ask me about Courtney.

Talking reckless, my nigga. For no reason.

25:38.163 --> 25:39.039
For no reason?

25:40.331 --> 25:41.374

25:42.000 --> 25:45.712

The whole time you was playing me.

25:45.795 --> 25:47.380

Right now, I'll go to the police.

25:52.302 --> 25:53.428

26:04.314 --> 26:05.440
You're not gon' use the audio?

26:05.523 --> 26:06.691
-No.
-Then why do you have it?

26:06.775 --> 26:08.068
-Because, bruh, I got--
-What are you--

26:08.151 --> 26:10.195
-Be straight with me?
-I got a shitty public defender

26:10.278 --> 26:13.156

to take this fucking plea deal.

26:13.239 --> 26:14.324
What's the deal?

26:14.699 --> 26:15.825
I turn myself in,

26:16.659 --> 26:19.120

26:19.204 --> 26:21.289

26:21.373 --> 26:22.707
You don't have other options?

26:23.375 --> 26:27.879
Yeah, I could get a reduced sentence
if I pull somebody in with me.

26:32.008 --> 26:33.343
That's why you were recording me.

26:42.227 --> 26:44.104
So what are you gonna do?

26:45.105 --> 26:46.189
I don't know.

26:51.820 --> 26:57.617
You know, sometimes in life
it's just better to face shit head-on.

26:58.910 --> 27:02.122
I mean, like,
it could only get worse.

27:02.205 --> 27:03.832
You telling me you think
I should take this deal?

27:03.915 --> 27:04.916
I don't know.

27:06.292 --> 27:08.837
Is Stanley telling you
you should take the deal?

27:09.671 --> 27:10.672
Maybe he's right.

27:11.464 --> 27:14.175
Maurice,
you have so many people relying on you.

27:15.135 --> 27:16.428
And you know, it's not

27:17.595 --> 27:19.014
it's not like we're innocent.

27:21.850 --> 27:24.352
I don't know, maybe this way
you can stay in control.

27:24.436 --> 27:27.313
I've been dealing with
all this shit by myself, bruh.

27:27.939 --> 27:31.192

Well, how much time do you have?
Less than a week.

27:39.784 --> 27:42.787
I'm over this shit, dawg.

27:44.414 --> 27:46.041
-I got you.
