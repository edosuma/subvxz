A girl
on my soccer team.

39:08.750 --> 39:09.739
Alright, good.

39:09.750 --> 39:11.240
Well, then,
we'll ask her out.

39:11.250 --> 39:12.877
I mean, not me. You.
You'll ask her out.

39:12.880 --> 39:14.416
But I'll help.

39:14.420 --> 39:16.490
You have soccer tomorrow, right?
We'll do it then.

39:16.500 --> 39:18.070
I have to finish
my list first.

39:18.080 --> 39:19.957
Why do you
have to finish the list?

39:19.960 --> 39:22.747
I want to be a man,
just like you.

39:24.920 --> 39:27.036
[ Chuckling ] Okay.

39:27.040 --> 39:28.826
You think you need
to finish this list

39:28.830 --> 39:30.491
before you ask her out,

39:30.500 --> 39:31.990
and you've seen me do
all this stuff, right?

39:33.000 --> 39:35.161
Okay,
I know plenty of guys

39:35.170 --> 39:37.661
who can't do half the stuff
on this list,

39:37.670 --> 39:40.707
and they ask out girls
all the time.

39:40.710 --> 39:44.953
So you're already ahead of,
like, 75% of the population.

39:44.960 --> 39:46.325
Being a real man

39:46.330 --> 39:48.707
has nothing to do with
the things on that list.

39:48.710 --> 39:52.498
A real man, he --
he keeps his promises

39:52.500 --> 39:53.990
and he makes sacrifices

39:55.710 --> 39:57.530
and he does
the little things

39:57.540 --> 40:00.282
to show them
how much he cares.

40:00.290 --> 40:02.702
Like making Dex coffee
every morning.

40:04.040 --> 40:05.871
You don't need
to finish this list

40:05.880 --> 40:08.166
before you ask her out.

40:08.170 --> 40:10.491
You're ready right now.
You're already a man.

40:15.420 --> 40:17.991
[ Cellphone ringing ]

40:18.000 --> 40:19.820
Ooh.

40:19.830 --> 40:21.377
[ Ringing continues ]

40:21.380 --> 40:24.076
[ Indistinct talking ]

40:24.080 --> 40:25.616
Thanks.

40:28.290 --> 40:29.666
You did a good thing.

40:29.670 --> 40:32.036
For once.

40:32.040 --> 40:33.200
[ Snorts ]

40:36.580 --> 40:38.286
Dex, are you okay?

40:38.290 --> 40:40.531
Throwing any more parties
I should avoid?

40:42.250 --> 40:45.378
The house just gets so quiet,
you know?

40:45.380 --> 40:48.201
I love _that sound.
Silence.

40:49.920 --> 40:53.242
It reminds me
of the Helmand Desert.

40:53.250 --> 40:56.208
Enemy combatants
lurking everywhere.

40:56.210 --> 40:57.871
[ Sighs ]

41:00.460 --> 41:03.076
Maybe it's not the worst thing
in the world,

41:03.080 --> 41:05.287
getting used to
being on your own.

41:08.960 --> 41:11.030
[ Bottles clink]

41:27.960 --> 41:30.110
Hey.
Grey: Hey.

41:30.120 --> 41:31.326
Um...

41:31.330 --> 41:32.911
You called in
the new guy?

41:32.920 --> 41:34.615
I think he can help,
okay?

41:34.620 --> 41:36.167
What's going on?

41:36.170 --> 41:37.660
I'm telling you,
we should get rid of it.
Shut up, Chaz.

41:37.670 --> 41:39.661
We can trust him.

41:39.670 --> 41:40.659
Right?

41:40.670 --> 41:42.535
Yeah, right.

41:44.380 --> 41:45.529
Leo.

41:48.040 --> 41:49.576
Max says
you know people.

41:50.830 --> 41:51.990
I do, yeah.

41:55.500 --> 41:57.616
We boosted a delivery truck
a while back.

41:57.620 --> 41:59.668
Assumed there'd be
some packages inside --

41:59.670 --> 42:02.958
TVs, maybe some cellphones,
stuff like that.

42:02.960 --> 42:06.782
Instead, we stumbled
into something, uh...

42:06.790 --> 42:08.530
above our pay grade.

42:08.540 --> 42:10.326
We need you
to help us move it.

42:10.330 --> 42:11.740
Well, what is it?

42:13.000 --> 42:14.035
Heroin.

42:15.670 --> 42:17.456
A bunch of it.
