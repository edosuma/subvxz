But 3,000 smackers?
No! What am I going to do?

15:08.250 --> 15:09.709
What am I going to do?

15:09.792 --> 15:13.834
-Couldn't you take a job, or something?
-A job?

15:14.000 --> 15:18.041
Kit, you're a genius, with a capital J.

15:18.125 --> 15:22.041
[laughs] I'll just find a job here
on the old job board.

15:22.125 --> 15:27.625
-Can you really make $3,000 this fast?
-Yeah, if the job's nasty enough.

15:27.709 --> 15:29.792
Ah-ha, a zoo delivery!

15:29.875 --> 15:33.750
Wait. What exactly are we delivering?

15:33.834 --> 15:38.291
Well, they're sort of, uh, big and mean,

15:38.542 --> 15:42.709
and, and, and ugly, and smelly.

15:42.792 --> 15:45.875
Oh, no! Not gorilla birds!

15:53.291 --> 15:55.125
See? Nothing to it.

15:55.208 --> 15:58.834
-Yeah, right.
-It's a piece of cake.

15:58.917 --> 16:02.083
Get them out of here!
They're eating my plane!

16:02.166 --> 16:04.667
[yelling]

16:06.917 --> 16:09.083
Whew, close one.

16:09.166 --> 16:12.792
-Hey, whose side are you on?
-Sorry!

16:12.875 --> 16:16.125
Lock them up in the back.
Is that too much to ask?

16:16.208 --> 16:20.166
Hey, wait, you're the one who said,
"This is gonna be a piece of cake."

16:20.875 --> 16:23.709
[Baloo]
It looks like we're in for some icing.

16:27.083 --> 16:29.166
[Don Karnage] Get them, my men. Get them!

16:29.250 --> 16:30.750
[Baloo] Pirates again?

16:30.834 --> 16:34.917
-What could these guys possibly want?
-Don't look at me.

16:38.750 --> 16:40.959
Hang on, little britches.

17:12.875 --> 17:16.791
[laughing] Hey, my flying is A-plus.

17:16.875 --> 17:18.125
Whoa!

17:18.208 --> 17:21.290
[Baloo and Kit yelling]

17:34.834 --> 17:38.041
Yeah, but your landings are C-minus.

17:38.125 --> 17:42.458
[Don Karnage] Curses and more curses!
They are down there somewhere.

17:42.542 --> 17:46.625
-Find the boy, got it?
-[man] Yeah, we got it.

17:49.834 --> 17:52.417
I'm sorry, baby. You OK?

17:52.500 --> 17:54.667
Phew. I think we lost them.

17:54.750 --> 17:57.542
Maybe, but it don't figure.

17:57.625 --> 18:01.500
I've got nothing they want, but they
attack us every time me and you...

18:02.458 --> 18:06.500
Wait a minute. You! They're after you!

18:08.500 --> 18:12.041
Talk, to me, Kit.
What's with you and the pirates?

18:12.125 --> 18:16.667
-Look, what do you care?
-They're shooting up my plane, son!

18:16.750 --> 18:19.500
Yeah, that's all that matters,
your plane, your plane.

18:21.083 --> 18:22.542
Hey, where do you think you're going?

18:24.583 --> 18:28.000
Ah, he'll be back. The birds!

18:29.875 --> 18:34.125
All he cares about is his plane.
I'll get my own plane! Better than his!

18:34.208 --> 18:39.667
Hello, my boy! Long-time no see, <i>si?</i>

18:39.750 --> 18:42.583
Here, birdy, birdy, birdies.

18:42.709 --> 18:44.959
Come to old Baloo.

18:45.041 --> 18:46.291
[sniffing]

18:46.375 --> 18:48.250
[grunting]

18:49.125 --> 18:50.917
Come here, you pillow stuffing!

18:51.000 --> 18:56.208
Still having trouble remembering
where the box is, eh?

18:56.291 --> 19:01.542
Perhaps a night in the jungle will...
jog your memory.

19:02.208 --> 19:06.125
There are numerous hungry animals
in the jungle, you know,

19:06.208 --> 19:07.792
-with sharp, pointy--
-[crunch]

19:07.917 --> 19:09.333
Teeth!

19:09.709 --> 19:12.291
You... You bit me!

19:13.333 --> 19:16.583
March, you overgrown feather dusters.
[chuckles]

19:16.667 --> 19:19.959
Thanks to you, the <i>Sea Duck </i> is all mine!

19:20.500 --> 19:22.667
[Don Karnage]
This is your last chance, boy.

19:22.750 --> 19:24.750
Is the box in the plane?

19:25.709 --> 19:28.709
Plane, what plane? I walked here.

19:28.792 --> 19:32.875
No use protecting your friend.
We will find him.

19:32.959 --> 19:36.208
[scoffs] Friend? I don't have any friends.

19:36.291 --> 19:37.500
It's Kit!

19:37.583 --> 19:38.542
[squawks]

19:38.625 --> 19:40.125
Shh. Quiet.

19:40.125 --> 19:43.583
OK. We'll do it the hard way.

19:43.667 --> 19:49.125
Dumptruck, get me the turnips
and the sandpaper.

19:49.208 --> 19:53.208
That kid's something else.
I got to save him.

19:54.667 --> 19:57.792
Oh, I'm going to hate myself
in the morning.

19:57.875 --> 20:02.041
Excellent. Now, my boy,

20:02.125 --> 20:04.458
I want some answers.

20:04.542 --> 20:09.458
-Stuff it in your windsock!
-My windsock?

20:09.542 --> 20:11.834
Why, you little...

20:12.375 --> 20:13.750
[sniffing]

20:13.834 --> 20:15.000
What is that smell?

20:15.083 --> 20:16.959
[squawking]

20:17.083 --> 20:19.125
No time to be hanging around, kid.

20:21.417 --> 20:24.041
What is going on? What is going on?

20:24.834 --> 20:26.291
[both yelping]

20:33.250 --> 20:35.875
-Pull chalks.
-Pull chalks.

20:36.583 --> 20:39.875
-Oh, no!
-Oh, no!

20:40.000 --> 20:42.250
[both yelling]

20:42.667 --> 20:44.041
No!

20:46.417 --> 20:49.083
But, Baloo, what about your birds?

20:49.166 --> 20:51.417
Hey, what's more important,

20:51.500 --> 20:55.250
those burping buzzards
or my new navigator?

21:06.709 --> 21:08.959
Where does he keep his spoons?

21:09.500 --> 21:10.625
Baloo?

21:10.709 --> 21:16.250
Now, remember, you be good to your
new owner, like you were good to me.

21:17.000 --> 21:18.667
Make me proud.

21:18.750 --> 21:21.792
I'm... I'm sorry about your plane.

21:21.875 --> 21:25.333
Listen, nobody's ever stood up
for me before, and...

21:26.041 --> 21:29.583
Well, I have a treasure.
I'll share it with you.

21:29.667 --> 21:31.792
[laughs] Thanks, little britches,

21:31.875 --> 21:35.166
but I don't think
your bottle cap collection can help.

21:35.250 --> 21:39.542
-No, it's a big glowing jewel!
-Sure, kid.

21:39.625 --> 21:42.542
Why do you think the pirates are after me?

21:42.625 --> 21:45.166
A jewel? You mean it?

21:45.250 --> 21:47.000
I hid it at Louie's.

21:47.750 --> 21:49.959
I could buy back the <i>Sea Duck!</i>

21:50.083 --> 21:53.291
[laughs]
We could buy a whole bunch of <i>Sea Ducks.</i>

21:53.375 --> 21:57.750
Well, how about we go get it first thing
in the morning, you and me.

21:57.834 --> 21:59.959
I'm gone, and we gotta fly.
