00:02.733 --> 00:04.533
-(phone rings)

00:04.567 --> 00:07.300
-Hey. Hey, Arnold.
-Arnold?

00:07.333 --> 00:09.700
Is it Arnold? Hey, Arnold!
-Arnold: Josh! Josh,
I bought too many groceries

00:09.733 --> 00:11.667
and I didn't want to call
a taxi for such a short fare,

00:11.700 --> 00:13.367
and I didn't know
what to do, so...

00:13.400 --> 00:15.400
I took the trolley home.

00:15.433 --> 00:16.667
-Josh:
You stole a trolley?

00:16.700 --> 00:19.200
-Shut up.
I didn't steal a trolley.

00:19.233 --> 00:21.333
-Well, this is ...

00:21.367 --> 00:22.600
This is disappointing behavior.

00:22.633 --> 00:25.533
-Listen, it was so loud
and humiliating and awful,

00:25.567 --> 00:28.333
and when I got home,
my Dad said trolleys
are all electric

00:28.367 --> 00:30.067
and trackable these days.

00:30.100 --> 00:32.067
-Well, is just not true, is it?

00:32.100 --> 00:33.500
-Isn't it? I don't know.

00:33.533 --> 00:35.500
He's my dad.
I'm used to trusting him.

00:35.533 --> 00:38.800
-Arnold's Dad thinks
trolleys are all electric
and trackable.

00:38.833 --> 00:41.567
-No! Oh, but maybe. Maybe.

00:41.600 --> 00:43.033
-He freaked out,
then I freaked out

00:43.067 --> 00:45.800
and now I have to
take it all the way back.

00:45.833 --> 00:47.200
-Tell him about the chickens.

00:47.233 --> 00:49.467
-Arnold, just ditch it.
Just ditch the trolley.

00:49.500 --> 00:50.667
-No, I couldn't!
-Ditch it, Arnold.

00:50.700 --> 00:51.767
-What if someone sees?

00:51.800 --> 00:53.167
-No one is looking at you.

00:53.200 --> 00:54.700
-They might look.
They could look.

00:54.733 --> 00:56.200
-Arnold, it'll be
so invigorating.

00:56.233 --> 00:58.367
Just ditch it.
Just stop walking,

00:58.400 --> 01:02.367
let go and go home.
Have a bath.

01:02.400 --> 01:04.133
-I can't, Josh!

01:04.167 --> 01:05.400
-I'm going to count you in.

01:05.433 --> 01:07.500
-No. Okay, yeah. Okay.

01:07.533 --> 01:09.300
-Five... four...

01:09.333 --> 01:11.100
-God.
-Three...

01:11.133 --> 01:13.233
two... one...
-Arnold: God.

01:13.267 --> 01:14.767
-(shopping cart rolling)

01:17.700 --> 01:19.767
-Arnold, I...
I can still hear it.

01:26.700 --> 01:29.200
What's happening now?
-I left it!

01:29.233 --> 01:32.033
I'm running! I'm running!
I left it! I'm running!

01:32.067 --> 01:33.733
-You did it!
-Yes!

01:33.767 --> 01:36.100
-Victory!
-I've never felt so alive!

01:43.867 --> 01:45.333
Okay.

01:45.367 --> 01:47.467
-Done.
-Done.

01:47.500 --> 01:49.633
-Josh:
So you didn't reply
to any of my texts,

01:49.667 --> 01:52.400
I decided to stop sending
them because I was
embarrassing myself.

01:52.433 --> 01:54.233
-No. I'm sorry,
no, it's not you.

01:54.267 --> 01:55.833
I just had exams.

01:55.867 --> 01:57.600
-Invite him
to see the chickens.

01:57.633 --> 01:59.033
-Josh:
What are you doing tonight?

01:59.067 --> 02:00.800
-Panicking that the police
will track the trolley.

02:00.833 --> 02:03.167
-And would you like to come over
and look at our chickens?

02:03.200 --> 02:04.467
We're getting
little baby chickens.

02:04.500 --> 02:06.800
-Tell him if he says no,
I'll tell his Dad what
he's been up to.

02:06.833 --> 02:09.133
-But you told me you
just want to be friends,

02:09.167 --> 02:13.400
so maybe coming over
to my house at night time
is not a great idea.

02:13.433 --> 02:16.033
-I don't know if I can. I'm...

02:16.067 --> 02:18.533
Okay, yeah, yeah, I will.
I'll come for dinner.

02:18.567 --> 02:19.733
-Josh:
Yes!

02:21.600 --> 02:25.267
-Well, it is going to be
a depressing dinner for me,

02:25.300 --> 02:27.767
knowing you're sitting there
wishing you could gay kiss him

02:27.800 --> 02:29.000
but you're not allowed.

02:30.600 --> 02:32.133
-* One, two

02:32.167 --> 02:33.467
* One, two, three, four

02:33.500 --> 02:35.167
* Ooh

02:35.200 --> 02:38.467
* Yeah, I'll be fine, yeah

02:38.500 --> 02:40.667
* Ooh

02:40.700 --> 02:42.400
* Up yeah here

02:42.433 --> 02:44.167
* Up yeah the good
Lord knows it *

02:44.200 --> 02:45.233
* Ooh

02:45.267 --> 02:46.733
* Up the good
Lord knows it *

02:46.767 --> 02:48.033
* Ooh

02:48.067 --> 02:51.300
* I left better behind
to be fine *

02:51.333 --> 02:53.200
* Yeah, yeah

02:53.233 --> 02:56.033
* Take my mommah
turn another blind eye *

02:56.067 --> 02:57.800
* Yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah *

02:57.833 --> 03:00.100
* I left better behind
to be fine *

03:00.133 --> 03:03.133
-Thanks for dinner.
-Oh yeah, thanks...
thanks for coming.

03:05.500 --> 03:07.000
-Okay.

03:12.800 --> 03:15.300
-(door closes)
-He left?

03:15.333 --> 03:16.667
-Yeah.

03:16.700 --> 03:18.700
-Why would you agree
to just be friends with him?

03:18.733 --> 03:20.300
-I was just trying
to be polite.

03:20.333 --> 03:21.633
-No one wants
to be friends.

03:21.667 --> 03:23.067
Everyone knows
this, don't they?

03:23.100 --> 03:24.200
-You're right, yeah.

03:24.233 --> 03:26.267
I already have one friend
and where did that get me?

03:26.300 --> 03:27.767
-I won those
Cirque du Soleil tickets.

03:27.800 --> 03:29.233
-Exactly!

03:31.700 --> 03:33.067
My feelings hurt.

03:33.100 --> 03:38.000
-Sorry. Just did not
realize you had feelings.

03:39.833 --> 03:41.167
-(knocking)

03:41.200 --> 03:43.200
-I'm having nightmares.

03:43.233 --> 03:45.167
-Is this an excuse
to hang out

03:45.200 --> 03:46.700
because you're feeling
rejected and alone?

03:46.733 --> 03:49.133
-I had nightmares.
-What do you want me to do?

03:49.167 --> 03:50.367
-I want to sleep in here.

03:50.400 --> 03:52.667
-You could sleep
on the floor.

03:52.700 --> 03:53.767
-Okay.

03:56.667 --> 03:58.133
-(rustling)

04:08.233 --> 04:10.300
-Did your nightmares go?

04:10.333 --> 04:12.233
-They've just been replaced
by me being furious

04:12.267 --> 04:13.667
that you wouldn't let
me sleep in your bed.

04:13.700 --> 04:14.900
-Don't be ungrateful.

04:14.933 --> 04:17.600
-It's not like you've actually
inconvenienced yourself for me.

04:17.633 --> 04:20.233
-Can't masturbate now
because of you.

04:20.267 --> 04:21.800
-Were you going to?

04:21.833 --> 04:24.800
-No, but you've
taken away my freedom.

04:29.233 --> 04:30.733
-This...

04:30.767 --> 04:33.133
this right here,
what we're doing here,

04:33.167 --> 04:36.067
is the loneliest thing
I've ever done.

04:36.100 --> 04:38.800
Sleeping with you is lonelier
than being alone.

04:38.833 --> 04:41.067
-Go back to your room then.

04:41.100 --> 04:43.800
-With all the monsters?
No thank you.

04:43.833 --> 04:44.967
-(chirping)

04:45.000 --> 04:47.467
-Mum:
Don't you think Arnold's
maybe a bit annoying?

04:47.500 --> 04:50.233
-No, obviously
I don't think that.

04:50.267 --> 04:52.033
-Well, I don't like him.

04:52.067 --> 04:54.633
But that doesn't matter,
'cause I don't have to date him.

04:54.667 --> 04:58.700
Oh, he's such
a frightened little boy.

04:58.733 --> 05:03.167
He's so fragile and insecure
but, oh, look, you like him.

05:03.200 --> 05:04.633
And you know,
we can't choose

05:04.667 --> 05:06.400
who we like
and he seems to like you.

05:06.433 --> 05:09.367
And look, you know,
we've all got issues,

05:09.400 --> 05:11.700
so maybe it's good
for you to work through
something like this.

05:11.733 --> 05:14.400
I just ... why does
he flirt with you

05:14.433 --> 05:16.233
and then not want
to pursue anything?

05:16.267 --> 05:19.333
So maybe that's because
of his issues or maybe...

05:19.367 --> 05:23.633
maybe he doesn't care enough
about you to even bother.

05:23.667 --> 05:26.200
So why don't you just
find somebody easier than that?

05:26.233 --> 05:28.767
-I never meet
any new people I like.

05:28.800 --> 05:30.533
When was the last time
you met a new person

05:30.567 --> 05:33.533
and thought, "Oh, gosh,
that's an interesting thing
you just said"?

05:33.567 --> 05:35.367
-Well that's 'cause
you're too bloody fussy.

05:35.400 --> 05:38.100
No. I'm calling it.

05:38.133 --> 05:39.567
No, he's too difficult, Josh.

05:39.600 --> 05:40.800
I just think you should
move on now.

05:40.833 --> 05:42.533
-You can't call it.

05:42.567 --> 05:43.867
-I'm calling it!

05:43.900 --> 05:48.367
-Arnold, Josh thinks
we can't name one
of the chickens Beyoncé.

05:48.400 --> 05:50.833
-Yeah, it's blasphemy.
-What are you naming
the other chickens?

05:50.867 --> 05:54.100
-Adele and Shakira?
-Beyoncé's too good
to be grouped with Shakira.

05:54.133 --> 05:56.233
-We can't not
name one Beyoncé.

05:56.267 --> 05:58.267
-He's right, Josh.
You know he's right.

05:58.300 --> 05:59.667
-Okay, yeah. I know, I know.

05:59.700 --> 06:03.300
I just wanted to make sure
we talked it through properly.

06:03.333 --> 06:05.100
-Do you have vegetarian pho?

06:05.133 --> 06:06.500
-Ah yes, tofu.

06:06.533 --> 06:08.367
-So it has a vegetarian stock?
-Yes.

06:08.400 --> 06:11.633
-Um, just... there's
no meat in the stock?

06:11.667 --> 06:14.133
-No meat.
-I'll have that then.

06:14.167 --> 06:17.133
-Tom:
You really didn't trust
that it was vegetarian pho.

06:17.167 --> 06:19.633
-Yeah, well sometimes
they bring it out
in chicken stock.

06:19.667 --> 06:23.500
-They? They?
Who's they?

06:23.533 --> 06:25.367
-Yeah, Arnold, who's they?

06:25.400 --> 06:28.233
-Just... them, okay?

06:28.267 --> 06:30.133
-Arnold, can I ask
you a question?

06:30.167 --> 06:31.300
-Yes.

06:31.333 --> 06:33.067
-Are you a racist?

06:33.100 --> 06:36.200
-(snickers)
-Tom, can I ask
you a question?

06:36.233 --> 06:37.600
-Yes.

06:37.633 --> 06:40.267
-Why do you have
no friends other than Josh?

06:40.300 --> 06:41.500
-(laughs)

06:41.533 --> 06:45.100
-Look, Arnold, I live
with a lot of regrets.

06:45.133 --> 06:46.733
-No! Say something nice, Tom.

06:46.767 --> 06:48.333
I'm trying to
court this bitch.

06:48.367 --> 06:49.700
-You have not
answered the question.

06:49.733 --> 06:53.033
-I love Asians.
A lot. Probably too much.

06:53.067 --> 06:55.100
-Whoa! (chuckles)
-If anything.

06:55.133 --> 06:58.200
-Hi. Oh, delicious.

06:58.233 --> 06:59.500
Thank you.
-Thank you.

06:59.533 --> 07:02.233
-Thank you.
-Thanks.

07:02.267 --> 07:04.167
This is nice.

07:04.200 --> 07:05.667
-Josh:
(giggles)

07:10.300 --> 07:11.567
You have to go, yeah?

07:11.600 --> 07:12.800
-Yeah.
-Yeah? You're going?

07:12.833 --> 07:15.467
-Yeah.
-Oh... oh gosh.

07:18.500 --> 07:20.667
You know, I have, like,
an entire bedroom.

07:20.700 --> 07:22.033
-I can't, I can't.
-It's just there.

07:31.867 --> 07:33.133
-Bye.

07:34.300 --> 07:36.033
Bye.

07:36.067 --> 07:40.567
-Hey, John, do you think
if you were a real boy,
you'd date me?

07:40.600 --> 07:42.067
Of course you would.

07:44.067 --> 07:45.667
-I just don't know
what else I have
to offer, okay?

07:45.700 --> 07:48.200
I've made him
so many dinners,
vegetarian dinners.

07:48.233 --> 07:49.800
I feel like all I've been
doing since we met

07:49.833 --> 07:53.033
is salt eggplant and pat it
down with a paper towel
and he still...

07:53.067 --> 07:54.667
he still won't
have sex with me.

07:54.700 --> 07:57.267
-Yeah, what does
he think this is,
a Jane Austen novel?

07:57.300 --> 07:58.733
-Maybe he's frigid.

07:58.767 --> 08:00.233
-No, he's had so much sex.

08:00.267 --> 08:01.800
Just so much sex
with so many boys.

08:01.833 --> 08:04.033
-Tom: Really?
-Mm-hmm.

08:04.067 --> 08:06.233
-He's got anxiety.
It's probably not about you.

08:06.267 --> 08:07.500
-Well, that's what he says.

08:07.533 --> 08:08.767
It sounds to me like
a pretty convenient excuse

08:08.800 --> 08:11.033
not to have sex with somebody
'cause you think they're gross.

08:11.067 --> 08:12.467
-Hey, you're not gross.

08:12.500 --> 08:14.633
-You're beautiful,
like a hummingbird.

08:14.667 --> 08:16.567
-Like a baby seahorse.

08:16.600 --> 08:19.800
-You're like touching
the inside of a curtain tassel.

08:19.833 --> 08:22.267
-Like Harry Styles's
snail trail.

08:22.300 --> 08:24.833
-Okay.
-I bet you've got
a lovely penis too, you know?

08:24.867 --> 08:28.300
Like well proportioned,
sturdy, jaunty little hat.

08:28.333 --> 08:29.633
-You're like democracy.

08:29.667 --> 08:31.633
-You really think
I'm not gross?

08:31.667 --> 08:33.567
-(laughs) Oh no,
I was just pretending.

08:33.600 --> 08:34.800
-Hannah:
Yeah, I'm no expert.

08:34.833 --> 08:37.467
You all look
the same to me.

08:37.500 --> 08:38.667
-Let's go.

08:40.267 --> 08:41.500
-I have something
to tell you.

08:41.533 --> 08:44.300
-I hope it's compliments.
-I hate eggplant.

08:44.333 --> 08:45.767
-Eggplant?
You love eggplant!

08:45.800 --> 08:48.533
-It has the texture of slugs.
Why can't people see this?

08:48.567 --> 08:50.100
-But you're a vegetarian.

08:50.133 --> 08:52.433
-No, Josh, we've been
down that way three times.

08:52.467 --> 08:53.833
Three times.
-No, I think it's this way.

08:53.867 --> 08:56.267
-It's a dead end with
a patronizing rabbit statue.

08:56.300 --> 08:57.667
Hedges are supposed to be nice.

08:57.700 --> 08:59.300
Why are they turning
topiary against us?

08:59.333 --> 09:01.433
-Fuck you, patronizing
rabbit statue!
You don't own me!

09:01.467 --> 09:03.633
-No, Josh, I need you
to acknowledge that you heard

09:03.667 --> 09:05.133
that I hate the eggplant.

09:05.167 --> 09:07.067
-You've eaten
my eggplant at least twice.
-Twice,

09:07.100 --> 09:08.600
-Twice!
-Yeah, I know.

09:08.633 --> 09:10.333
-Gosh, you must really like me.

09:10.367 --> 09:12.167
-Okay, well, I was
just being polite.

09:12.200 --> 09:13.500
-Yeah, well, you could
cook me dinner.

09:13.533 --> 09:14.467
You could organize dates.

09:14.500 --> 09:17.133
Why do I always have
to call you, chase you?

09:17.167 --> 09:18.367
-I don't want you
to get too close

09:18.400 --> 09:20.200
and then realize
I'm actually not that likable.

09:20.233 --> 09:23.500
-Whoa. Whoa.

09:23.533 --> 09:25.233
-No, we're not stopping.

09:25.267 --> 09:27.467
This is getting to our heads.
We need to get out of here.

09:27.500 --> 09:29.067
It's like
the Triwizard Tournament.

09:29.100 --> 09:31.500
-Surely I get to
decide if you're likable.

09:31.533 --> 09:33.700
-I'm not ready
to be vulnerable for you.

09:33.733 --> 09:35.533
-Ooh! Wow.

09:35.567 --> 09:36.733
-This is it?

09:36.767 --> 09:39.733
-This is it! Victory!
-(screams)

09:39.767 --> 09:42.533
-(both laugh)

09:42.567 --> 09:45.167
-Okay, I'll organize
the next date.

09:46.333 --> 09:48.833
Oh God. Oh God,
I have made a mistake.

09:48.867 --> 09:50.433
-Josh:
No, you have definitely not.

09:50.467 --> 09:51.533
You have definitely
not made a mistake.

09:51.567 --> 09:53.533
-I mean, a moment ago,
I thought this was beautiful,

09:53.567 --> 09:55.433
but seeing you here now
has made me realize that

09:55.467 --> 09:57.200
perhaps it's like a bit much.

09:57.233 --> 09:58.700
-Oh, it is a lot.
-Yeah.

09:58.733 --> 10:01.300
Yeah, it's a lot. Isn't a lot?
-Is this because of the maze?

10:01.333 --> 10:03.433
"I'm not ready
to be vulnerable for you"?

10:03.467 --> 10:05.067
-No, I don't want
to talk about it.

10:05.100 --> 10:07.133
-Are you thinking
that maybe we're gonna

10:07.167 --> 10:08.700
have sex here
for the first time?

10:08.733 --> 10:10.433
-I don't know.

10:10.467 --> 10:13.433
-It's just that this is
exactly how 16-year-old girls

10:13.467 --> 10:15.067
imagine they're
going to lose their virginity.

10:15.100 --> 10:16.467
-Just shut up.

10:18.800 --> 10:20.567
-He hasn't said it.

10:20.600 --> 10:23.267
I think we're going to
have sex for the first time.

10:23.300 --> 10:24.767
-Okay, you just
need to... let me ...

10:24.800 --> 10:26.733
-Wonder how it will go.

10:26.767 --> 10:30.067
-(humming)

10:30.100 --> 10:32.133
* Kiss me

10:32.167 --> 10:34.433
* Right down
the milky twilight *

10:34.467 --> 10:36.700
-Come here.
-* Swing, swing

10:36.733 --> 10:38.733
(humming)

10:38.767 --> 10:42.200
* You wear the shirt
and I will wear that dress *
-Okay.

10:42.233 --> 10:44.533
-* Whoa! Kiss me

10:44.567 --> 10:47.367
-Okay!
-* Right down
the milky twilight *

10:51.167 --> 10:52.567
(giggles)

10:52.600 --> 10:55.167
-Do you not
want to have sex?

10:55.200 --> 10:56.833
-I do. It's all I've been
thinking about forever.

10:56.867 --> 10:59.300
It's just at the moment
what's been shooting

10:59.333 --> 11:01.800
in my mind is is how
you powered these lights.

11:01.833 --> 11:03.267
-Batteries.
-Batteries?

11:20.467 --> 11:21.833
-You'll tell me
if you're not okay, yeah?

11:21.867 --> 11:23.200
-Yeah, it's fine. It's fine.

11:25.267 --> 11:27.600
-* Kiss me

11:27.633 --> 11:30.333
* Out of the bearded barley
-Right, you should be on top.

11:30.367 --> 11:32.400
Do you want to
move this blanket?
-Okay.

11:32.433 --> 11:33.633
-Okay.

11:33.667 --> 11:35.500
-* Nightly, beside
the green, green grass *

11:35.533 --> 11:37.500
* Swing, swing

11:37.533 --> 11:39.300
-That's okay?

11:39.333 --> 11:43.567
-Okay, yeah, just
never ask me if it's okay
during sex again, yeah?

11:43.600 --> 11:45.033
-Okay. Deal.

11:45.067 --> 11:49.300
-* Oh, kiss me
beneath the milky twilight *

11:49.333 --> 11:54.800
* Lead me out
on the moonlit floor *

11:54.833 --> 11:56.533
* Lift your open hand

11:56.567 --> 12:00.067
* Strike up the band
and make the fireflies dance *

12:00.100 --> 12:02.667
* Silver moon's sparkling

12:04.833 --> 12:07.000
* So kiss me

12:12.567 --> 12:14.067
-You gonna sleep at my house?

12:14.100 --> 12:15.433
-You know I can't.

12:15.467 --> 12:17.300
My parents will ask
just so many questions.

12:17.333 --> 12:19.500
-Okay, okay.

12:19.533 --> 12:21.667
Maybe tell 'em
you're gay, yeah?

12:21.700 --> 12:24.067
-No.
-All right, all right.

12:28.500 --> 12:30.767
Mm. Delicious.

12:34.100 --> 12:36.667
-Claire: So I had sex
with that guy that I regretted
having sex with again.

12:36.700 --> 12:39.100
-Arnold and I finally had sex
and it was just terrific.

12:39.133 --> 12:40.233
It was just really fun.

12:40.267 --> 12:41.700
-He's fun?
-Yeah. Really fun.

12:41.733 --> 12:42.833
Really talented.

12:42.867 --> 12:45.667
Meanwhile,
Tom fingered his boss.

12:45.700 --> 12:48.533
-What?
-Are we... are we
telling people that?

12:48.567 --> 12:50.600
-Apparently.
-Is she a babe?

12:50.633 --> 12:53.100
-No, not a babe.
Is he a babe?

12:53.133 --> 12:55.500
-Yeah, but he's also
just the worst.

12:55.533 --> 12:57.400
-The sex was so fun
but now I'm freaking out

12:57.433 --> 12:59.467
out that maybe he's
a bad choice, you know?

12:59.500 --> 13:01.400
Maybe I stuffed up.
Maybe he's the wrong choice

13:01.433 --> 13:03.467
-Not a bad choice.
I know bad choices.

13:03.500 --> 13:05.333
I've made bad choices.
I've been a bad choice.

13:05.367 --> 13:07.333
-Yeah, Tom, why did
you finger the boss?

13:07.367 --> 13:08.433
-I didn't mean to.

13:08.467 --> 13:09.667
-What, did you fall in?

13:09.700 --> 13:11.267
-She's been flirting
with me for weeks.

13:11.300 --> 13:12.633
She told me she was
in love with my brain.

13:12.667 --> 13:14.033
-Claire and Josh:
What?

13:14.067 --> 13:15.700
-I'm very funny
when I'm at work.

13:15.733 --> 13:17.333
-He just kept saying
how much he loved my tits

13:17.367 --> 13:18.800
over and over again,
and I hate him.

13:18.833 --> 13:21.167
When I with him,
I guess I feel less alone,

13:21.200 --> 13:24.167
but then the next day,
it's like a tax
on my loneliness.

13:24.200 --> 13:25.800
-I think mostly
I'm freaking out

13:25.833 --> 13:27.733
because whilst I'm confident
Arnold makes me happy,

13:27.767 --> 13:30.067
I'm just not sure if
he makes me, like, the happiest.

13:30.100 --> 13:32.133
-Do you know what it takes
to be the happiest?

13:32.167 --> 13:34.200
You're versing the Dalai Lama.

13:34.233 --> 13:38.833
-Meanwhile, Tom's boss has
a husband and two tiny children.

13:38.867 --> 13:40.667
-If that the first
vagina you've ever touched

13:40.700 --> 13:41.800
that's had children
come out of it?

13:41.833 --> 13:44.467
-Ah, I guess, yes.

13:44.500 --> 13:45.733
-How did it feel?
Different?

13:45.767 --> 13:47.233
-No!

13:47.267 --> 13:49.733
-I'm just not sure how much
happiness we deserve.

13:49.767 --> 13:51.333
Not much.

13:53.200 --> 13:55.133
-I think if anyone knew
what was going on in my head,

13:55.167 --> 13:57.267
it would be impossible
for them to like me.

13:57.300 --> 14:00.100
-Can you tell me
some things you think would

14:00.133 --> 14:02.100
be impossible to like
and then we'll find out?

14:02.133 --> 14:03.167
-Um...

14:03.200 --> 14:06.200
before we go on dates,
I write a list of questions

14:06.233 --> 14:08.733
in my phone to ask you,
so if there's a lull

14:08.767 --> 14:12.133
in the conversation, I can
go to the bathroom to confer.

14:14.067 --> 14:15.533
-I appreciate the effort.

14:15.567 --> 14:17.600
-I've never
seen "Love Actually."

14:17.633 --> 14:19.733
-Whoa. Now actually,
no, that's not okay.

14:19.767 --> 14:21.433
That's crazy.
You crazy motherfucker!

14:21.467 --> 14:23.333
What a crazy motherfucker!

14:23.367 --> 14:25.833
-Remember when
I told you how much
I loved "Love Actually"?

14:25.867 --> 14:28.567
-No, I don't.
-Well, you told
me you loved it

14:28.600 --> 14:30.167
so I went home
and Googled it

14:30.200 --> 14:33.333
and I memorized the synopsis
and I told you I loved it too.

14:35.133 --> 14:36.633
-Right.

14:36.667 --> 14:38.600
No, I'm still in.
I still... I still like you.

14:38.633 --> 14:40.200
-Okay, sometimes
I go to places early

14:40.233 --> 14:41.833
to check where
the bathrooms and exits are.

14:41.867 --> 14:45.100
And look, I need you to know
that I know this is irrational.

14:45.133 --> 14:46.700
I'm going to worry
about things that

14:46.733 --> 14:48.333
you don't think
are a problem.

14:48.367 --> 14:50.767
-Yep.
-Like for example,
you might catch me

14:50.800 --> 14:53.633
when we're out at a club
hiding in a bathroom,

14:53.667 --> 14:56.600
which is a fine thing
to do if there's no one

14:56.633 --> 14:59.533
actually out there
looking for where I am.

14:59.567 --> 15:01.767
And I could kind of deal
with this when I was on my own,

15:01.800 --> 15:05.167
because when you're on your own,
you don't have to, like,

15:05.200 --> 15:08.567
have someone to answer to
to make you realize

15:08.600 --> 15:10.033
how truly fucked you are.

15:10.067 --> 15:11.667
And that's kinda
scary, you know?

15:11.700 --> 15:15.300
Because someone,
you, will actually--

15:15.333 --> 15:16.533
-Me?

15:16.567 --> 15:19.067
-Yeah, you'll actually
see all of this.

15:21.100 --> 15:22.133
-Okay.

15:22.167 --> 15:23.333
-Okay?
-Yep.

15:25.300 --> 15:28.300
-Um, so...

15:28.333 --> 15:31.633
my parents don't actually care
if I sleep somewhere.

15:31.667 --> 15:33.400
-How often do you lie to me?

15:33.433 --> 15:35.633
-Less and less.

15:35.667 --> 15:39.067
-Were you lying
when you said you think
I have a beautiful soul?

15:39.100 --> 15:41.233
-Did I say that?
I don't think
I actually said that.

15:41.267 --> 15:43.667
-That's the problem with lying.
It's hard to keep track of.

15:46.467 --> 15:48.033
Are you going to sleep over?

15:48.067 --> 15:50.133
-Yes, please.
-Okay.

16:01.400 --> 16:02.767
-Arnold has disappeared.

16:02.800 --> 16:04.433
I thought things
were going very well.

16:04.467 --> 16:05.600
I was very happy.

16:05.633 --> 16:06.833
I thought he was very happy.

16:06.867 --> 16:08.500
Now he won't
reply to my texts.

16:08.533 --> 16:10.100
I do not know why.

16:10.133 --> 16:11.167
It's been eight days.

16:11.200 --> 16:14.500
-I just decided
I liked him, too.

16:14.533 --> 16:16.233
Oh, you didn't hurt me!

16:18.600 --> 16:21.100
-I saw this documentary
which said that if you draw

16:21.133 --> 16:24.267
a line between the major
landmarks in Washington,

16:24.300 --> 16:27.133
it creates a pentagram.
Satan's symbol.

16:27.167 --> 16:30.067
How about that?

16:30.100 --> 16:31.633
You know, they had
a drawing there and all that,

16:31.667 --> 16:34.333
but I'm not sure who decided
how to join the dots,

16:34.367 --> 16:36.333
because anyone can draw
a pentagram on a map.

16:36.367 --> 16:38.267
If they'd just gone
around the edges,

16:38.300 --> 16:40.233
it would have made
a pentagon shape.

16:40.267 --> 16:43.600
I don't think there's
anything evil about pentagons.

16:43.633 --> 16:46.467
Then I'm not even convinced
there's anything evil
about pentagrams.

16:46.500 --> 16:49.100
But the documentary's
been pretty legitimate,
so who knows?

16:49.133 --> 16:51.433
-Who knows?

16:51.467 --> 16:53.300
-How are things with Arnold?

16:53.333 --> 16:55.067
-Not great.

16:55.100 --> 16:55.933
-Oh.

16:55.967 --> 16:57.367
-He's stopped
replying to my texts.

16:57.400 --> 16:59.067
I don't know why.

16:59.100 --> 17:00.100
Been over a week.

17:00.133 --> 17:03.067
-Maybe he's out
of phone credit.

17:03.100 --> 17:04.233
-Maybe.

17:31.167 --> 17:32.367
-(door opening)

17:33.867 --> 17:36.700
-So I've been drinking.

17:36.733 --> 17:38.800
I missed you.

17:38.833 --> 17:40.267
-Josh:
Hey.

17:42.633 --> 17:44.033
-Don't wake up.

18:10.767 --> 18:12.567
(whispering)
I love you.

18:17.167 --> 18:19.033
I love you.

18:22.867 --> 18:26.600
Josh, I love you.

18:35.300 --> 18:36.567
(sighs)

18:36.600 --> 18:39.100
-I didn't know what to do.
He just kept saying it.

18:39.133 --> 18:41.533
I just lay there
pretending to be asleep,

18:41.567 --> 18:43.167
playing dead
as if he was a bear.

18:43.200 --> 18:45.833
-He say it first.
You are the winner!

18:45.867 --> 18:49.100
-Yeah, yeah. I win.
-Aw, he love you!

18:49.133 --> 18:50.767
-Why would he say it like that?
That's how he wants

18:50.800 --> 18:52.700
to say "I love you"
for the first time?

18:52.733 --> 18:55.433
Drunk, with the words
"Poof Doof" stamped on his arm?

18:55.467 --> 18:57.033
-What is Poof Doof?

18:57.067 --> 18:58.300
-It's a gay club.

18:58.333 --> 19:01.033
-Oh. So do you love him?

19:01.067 --> 19:03.333
-I think I love him,
but also...

19:03.367 --> 19:04.767
I don't know
what love is, you know?

19:04.800 --> 19:06.500
-I love him.

19:06.533 --> 19:08.333
-Yeah, you barely know him.

19:08.367 --> 19:09.800
-But you have been so happy.

19:09.833 --> 19:10.900
-Have I?

19:10.933 --> 19:13.233
-When you are grumpy
you are like your father, hmm?

19:13.267 --> 19:16.333
Sometimes I get
so nervous you will
turn out like your father.

19:18.500 --> 19:20.167
-Arnold, it's their
first night outside.

19:20.200 --> 19:21.433
-I'm just so excited for them.

19:21.467 --> 19:22.767
-She wants to stand on you.

19:22.800 --> 19:24.533
-No no, thank you.
No please no.
-Yes. No, yes.

19:24.567 --> 19:26.167
Yes, Arnold, it's
their big special day.

19:26.200 --> 19:27.433
Let me put her
on your head.

19:27.467 --> 19:29.300
-Fine.

19:29.333 --> 19:31.533
-(clucking)

19:31.567 --> 19:33.200
-No-- Oh...

19:37.333 --> 19:40.367
-Hey, um, so
I have something to say.
-Yes?

19:40.400 --> 19:42.667
-I think now
is the perfect time.
-Okay.

19:42.700 --> 19:44.400
-I love you.

19:49.167 --> 19:50.533
(laughs)

19:50.567 --> 19:52.733
-I hope they're gonna
be okay in here.

19:52.767 --> 19:54.667
-Arnold, are you
not saying it back?

19:56.233 --> 19:59.033
-Ah, I, um...
-Arnold, say it back!

19:59.067 --> 20:01.433
-It's a really big deal
to me to say that.

20:01.467 --> 20:03.267
-Me too, also.

20:03.300 --> 20:06.300
-No, I... I don't...
I don't know.

20:06.333 --> 20:08.633
-Arnold, you already
said it, okay?

20:08.667 --> 20:11.200
You said it first.
Yeah, I was the winner.

20:11.233 --> 20:12.333
-Did I?
-You remember.

20:12.367 --> 20:14.100
Don't pretend
like you don't remember.

20:14.133 --> 20:16.733
-Just-- I don't--
I don't know.

20:25.567 --> 20:30.200
-I actually just
can't... do this.

20:30.233 --> 20:33.033
Like I get this
is a big deal for you,

20:33.067 --> 20:35.300
and you have a big,
complicated brain,

20:35.333 --> 20:39.400
but just... sometimes
my feelings need
to be thought of.

20:39.433 --> 20:42.467
-No, I am-- I'm not going
to be pressured into saying it.

20:42.500 --> 20:44.700
I'm just not
going to be, okay?

20:50.767 --> 20:53.100
-I need-- I need
you to go home.

20:53.133 --> 20:55.167
-No, I don't--
I don't want to go.

20:55.200 --> 20:56.200
I... I just--

20:56.233 --> 20:57.600
-I-- I do. Yeah.

20:57.633 --> 21:02.200
I-- I want you to...
I just... need you to just go.

21:06.433 --> 21:07.600
-Okay.

21:30.300 --> 21:32.600
-Josh:
He just doesn't like me.

21:32.633 --> 21:34.233
-Yeah?
-I'm a troll.

21:34.267 --> 21:36.567
-You're not a troll.
-No, I am. I am. I'm a troll.

21:36.600 --> 21:37.600
-You're not a troll.

21:37.633 --> 21:38.667
-Tom, I think if we learn
anything from this,

21:38.700 --> 21:41.067
it's that if I ever have
any feeling of self-doubt,

21:41.100 --> 21:42.700
anything at all,
that I am right, okay?

21:42.733 --> 21:44.367
I am correct.
I am a troll.

21:44.400 --> 21:46.567
-Okay, fine, you're a troll.
-Thank you.

21:46.600 --> 21:47.800
-A slightly balding troll.

21:47.833 --> 21:49.400
-Okay.

21:51.233 --> 21:53.033
I put myself out there.

21:53.067 --> 21:55.767
Never doing that again, am I?
That was a mistake.

21:55.800 --> 21:57.733
Lost whatever
the tiny little confidence...

21:57.767 --> 21:59.600
Bad choice.
-Yeah.

21:59.633 --> 22:02.433
Yeah, you're like, um,
like a little baby deer.

22:02.467 --> 22:04.033
You're like
a little baby deer

22:04.067 --> 22:06.333
and you're trying
to take its first steps.

22:06.367 --> 22:08.667
You're trying to dig its foot
and you get this...
you get this strength.

22:08.700 --> 22:10.033
and you finally...
you balance up

22:10.067 --> 22:13.700
on your little dainty-- your
little dainty deer hooves...
-Yeah.

22:13.733 --> 22:16.367
-...and then Arnold comes
and he shoots you in your face!

22:16.400 --> 22:19.567
He shoots you
in your baby deer face.
-Yeah. Yeah, he did.

22:19.600 --> 22:21.067
He did.
He shot me in my face.

22:21.100 --> 22:22.533
-Yeah.
-And I'm just twitching.

22:22.567 --> 22:25.100
I'm just twitching, just
alone on the... on the snow.
-Yeah.

22:25.133 --> 22:26.700
Yeah, little
baby deer troll face

22:26.733 --> 22:28.500
just sprawled
all over the ice.

22:28.533 --> 22:30.733
-Wondering where my Mum is.
-(laughs)

22:30.767 --> 22:32.500
-Thank you.

22:32.533 --> 22:33.833
-You'll find
someone else, though.

22:33.867 --> 22:35.400
-You don't mean that.
-No.

22:35.433 --> 22:37.467
It's you and me
against the world, baby.

22:56.667 --> 22:58.533
-Oh. Hi.

23:03.533 --> 23:06.300
-* Silent night
-"It's carol singers."

23:06.333 --> 23:08.400
Well give 'em a quid
and tell 'em to bugger off!

23:08.433 --> 23:12.333
-* Holy night

23:12.367 --> 23:16.533
* All is calm

23:16.567 --> 23:20.533
* All is bright

23:20.567 --> 23:24.767
* Round yon virgin

23:24.800 --> 23:29.167
* Mother and child

23:29.200 --> 23:33.033
* Holy infant

23:33.067 --> 23:37.800
* So tender and mild

23:37.833 --> 23:43.233
* Sleep in heavenly peace

23:46.333 --> 23:51.333
* Sleep in heavenly peace

23:55.300 --> 23:59.500
* Silent night

23:59.533 --> 24:03.167
* Holy night

24:03.200 --> 24:07.667
* Son of God

24:07.700 --> 24:12.167
* Love's pure light

24:12.200 --> 24:15.467
* Radiant beams

24:15.500 --> 24:20.700
* From thy holy face

24:20.733 --> 24:24.133
* With the dawn

24:24.167 --> 24:27.600
* Of redeeming grace

24:29.433 --> 24:34.733
* Jesus, Lord at thy birth

24:38.067 --> 24:43.333
* Jesus, Lord at thy birth
