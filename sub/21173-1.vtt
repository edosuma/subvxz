00:18.418 --> 00:19.248
- So, these are getting

00:19.253 --> 00:20.193
Blown up a little bit tighter

00:20.194 --> 00:23.617
Than my comfort level
is really into.

00:24.357 --> 00:25.957
- Now that all the big
balloons are inflated,

00:25.960 --> 00:27.690
We're moving into the
small party balloons now

00:27.695 --> 00:28.785
To make chains.

00:28.796 --> 00:31.126
- And
everyone's gonna focus on that.

00:31.132 --> 00:32.832
So this team's working now.

00:32.833 --> 00:33.833
- We fixed it.

00:33.834 --> 00:34.674
We fixed the problem.

00:34.675 --> 00:37.038
We're gonna get liftoff.

00:37.804 --> 00:39.439
- Okay, you're good.

00:39.440 --> 00:43.580
Yeah, we're gonna go out
with three at a time.

00:54.454 --> 00:58.064
It's like the biggest game
of operation and...

00:59.726 --> 01:02.956
- I have no idea
how to start this film.

01:02.963 --> 01:04.863
But I actually do have

01:04.864 --> 01:07.225
The end all figured out.

01:08.401 --> 01:12.671
I'm going to attach 6,000
yellow balloons to myself.

01:13.540 --> 01:17.740
And then I'm gonna take
off against the blue sky.

01:25.418 --> 01:28.018
The yellow contrasting brightly,

01:28.022 --> 01:30.692
And that's just gonna be it.

01:36.996 --> 01:39.156
Jubilation music, probably

01:39.166 --> 01:41.596
Something Sigur Ros like.

01:45.505 --> 01:49.475
That's actually my
Girlfriend Veza up there.

01:50.577 --> 01:52.177
I, myself, turned out to be

01:52.179 --> 01:53.579
Too fat for takeoff,

01:53.581 --> 01:56.681
Or, like I prefer to believe,

01:56.684 --> 01:59.284
The balloon gas contracted

01:59.286 --> 02:00.616
In the freezing cold

02:00.621 --> 02:01.721
And threw all of our

02:01.722 --> 02:03.662
Math into disarray.

02:04.858 --> 02:05.788
- Get everybody else back.

02:05.793 --> 02:09.293
- Okay, I need everybody out...

02:09.295 --> 02:10.856
Are you okay, Veza?

02:10.865 --> 02:11.925
- I love it.

02:11.932 --> 02:13.466
- Okay, one more time.

02:13.467 --> 02:17.737
- Well, this is
actually what really happened.

02:20.240 --> 02:23.309
Me not flying in the blue sky

02:23.310 --> 02:26.880
Makes a little bit
more sense after all.

02:26.881 --> 02:28.281
- It would be great if you could

02:28.282 --> 02:29.716
Go more for height.

02:29.717 --> 02:31.547
You're not jumping
particularly high.

02:31.552 --> 02:35.192
You're just kind of
moving horizontally.

02:36.222 --> 02:38.892
- We need to take
this position again.

02:38.893 --> 02:41.133
- It's like, how can
we not get this shot

02:41.134 --> 02:43.396
With someone in the air?

02:43.397 --> 02:45.497
- Stefan's gonna
come out of the rig.

02:45.499 --> 02:46.766
- No.

02:46.767 --> 02:48.627
- Okay, I'm the director here,

02:48.636 --> 02:50.836
I'm gonna make a decision.

02:50.838 --> 02:51.998
- One thing is that harness

02:52.006 --> 02:54.736
Isn't built professionally.

02:54.742 --> 02:57.010
It is not meant for that.

02:57.011 --> 02:58.011
- Well then I go in this one.

02:58.012 --> 03:02.081
And it's going to be dark
by the time we get him off.

03:02.082 --> 03:03.282
Hang on, hang on, hang on,

03:03.284 --> 03:05.752
Exactly what you
shouldn't be doing

03:05.753 --> 03:07.353
Under the pressure, under
the time constraints,

03:07.354 --> 03:08.688
And the sunset.

03:08.689 --> 03:09.989
You should definitely
not be trying to rig

03:09.990 --> 03:11.090
Someone else into the harness.

03:11.091 --> 03:12.821
- This is a film about me

03:12.826 --> 03:15.156
Trying to make myself happier.

03:15.162 --> 03:18.362
- This is exactly the
shit that I'm talking about.

03:20.433 --> 03:21.503
A number of years earlier,

03:21.504 --> 03:23.942
I was on sabbatical in Bali.

03:24.704 --> 03:26.944
My best friend visited
from new york,

03:26.945 --> 03:30.711
And was checking how I
was spending my time.

03:34.013 --> 03:35.651
I was pretty much
making furniture,

03:35.652 --> 03:38.279
And he looked at all of it
and said, that's good enough

03:38.285 --> 03:41.885
But somehow,
if you come back after a year

03:41.889 --> 03:44.619
With these couple of
chairs and these ideas,

03:44.625 --> 03:48.755
I'm not quite sure if
that's all that worthwhile.

03:53.499 --> 03:56.029
Well, this is really
when the whole idea

03:56.036 --> 03:58.066
For the happy film came up.

03:58.072 --> 04:01.042
I had given a talk on design
and happiness many times,

04:01.043 --> 04:05.078
And I'd always received
really good feedback and

04:05.079 --> 04:07.409
It just seemed like a juicy

04:07.414 --> 04:10.984
Design problem itself,
to make a proper

04:10.985 --> 04:12.315
Project out of it.

04:13.353 --> 04:14.723
And it would force me to

04:14.724 --> 04:17.322
Research the subject properly.

04:18.825 --> 04:22.725
After talking to many
psychologists, I wrote a script.

04:22.730 --> 04:25.330
And I made a list and a plan.

04:25.332 --> 04:27.172
I love making a plan.

04:28.201 --> 04:29.271
It got big.

04:30.570 --> 04:33.070
Anything, fitted in there.

04:33.073 --> 04:34.743
It turned out that making
a film about happiness

04:34.744 --> 04:38.742
Was somehow like
making a film about life.

04:38.746 --> 04:41.206
Too big, just impossible.

04:41.215 --> 04:42.775
I narrowed it down to

04:42.783 --> 04:44.583
My own happiness instead.

04:44.585 --> 04:47.015
After all, on my own happiness,

04:47.021 --> 04:51.621
I really am the world's
number one expert.

04:53.726 --> 04:55.786
The big question really is

04:55.796 --> 04:59.526
Can I train my mind
in the same way

04:59.533 --> 05:01.573
That I can train my body?

05:01.701 --> 05:03.471
And by far, the best book I read

05:03.472 --> 05:05.870
Was this one by Jonathan Haidt.

05:05.873 --> 05:07.043
So I called him up

05:07.044 --> 05:10.076
And he agreed
to be the scientific

05:10.077 --> 05:11.937
Adviser for this film.

05:11.945 --> 05:12.875
- So, there are three really

05:12.880 --> 05:14.080
Well validated techniques

05:14.081 --> 05:15.881
For changing
your habitual thinking.

05:15.883 --> 05:17.983
The first technique
is meditation.

05:17.985 --> 05:19.915
You concentrate
and you learn to let go

05:19.920 --> 05:21.750
Of thoughts
that make you less happy.

05:21.755 --> 05:22.715
Buddha said something like,

05:22.723 --> 05:24.757
A man must train his mind

05:24.758 --> 05:26.058
Like an elephant tamer

05:26.060 --> 05:27.290
Tames an elephant.

05:27.294 --> 05:29.664
The second technique
is cognitive therapy.

05:29.665 --> 05:31.063
It's a lot easier
than meditation.

05:31.065 --> 05:32.455
People have much higher
success rates.

05:32.466 --> 05:34.066
You catch
your distorted thinking

05:34.068 --> 05:35.968
And you learn to correct it.

05:35.969 --> 05:37.899
The third technique is drugs.

05:37.905 --> 05:40.435
Like Lexapro and Prozac.

05:40.441 --> 05:42.741
They really do change
the way you think.

05:42.743 --> 05:44.283
And they change your
habitual thought patterns.

05:44.284 --> 05:46.238
- I'm going to try them all out

05:46.246 --> 05:47.646
For three months each.

05:47.648 --> 05:50.316
So I should be done
in 12 months.

05:50.317 --> 05:53.817
I'm going to measure
my happiness daily

05:53.821 --> 05:56.421
On a scale from one to 10.

05:56.423 --> 06:00.159
I'll double-check that here
and there with an MRI scan.

06:00.160 --> 06:01.530
I'll do an EEG.

06:03.763 --> 06:07.266
I'll keep track of
my behavior every week.

06:07.267 --> 06:09.697
And I'll tape a video diary.

06:10.536 --> 06:13.436
And I know little about
how to make a film.

06:13.440 --> 06:16.780
So I'll ask my friend Hillman
for help.

06:20.613 --> 06:23.349
And like a proper
graphic designer,

06:23.350 --> 06:24.850
Before I did any of that,

06:24.852 --> 06:27.052
Before shooting anything,

06:28.521 --> 06:31.461
I started with
the title sequence.

07:10.563 --> 07:13.533
It is now may 2009.

07:15.001 --> 07:19.271
And I would say that my
overall level of well-being is,

07:23.209 --> 07:25.609
Right now, maybe like a six.

07:26.546 --> 07:30.116
But I've already come up from

07:31.684 --> 07:33.753
Maybe, like three.

07:33.754 --> 07:34.794
I would say

07:36.856 --> 07:38.186
Two or three weeks ago.

07:38.591 --> 07:41.691
I clearly did
lose a lot of weight.

07:43.763 --> 07:45.531
Most of my trousers

07:45.532 --> 07:47.200
Don't really fit anymore.

07:47.201 --> 07:48.031
I mean, you see,

07:48.035 --> 07:51.795
Even this one is...

07:51.805 --> 07:52.865
Fairly loose

07:52.873 --> 07:54.640
To say the least.

07:54.641 --> 07:58.241
Or I can, well, it's also
an advantage, I guess.

07:58.245 --> 07:59.875
I can dress and redress so

07:59.880 --> 08:02.310
Much quicker in the morning.

08:04.383 --> 08:07.487
Altogether, I just broke off a

08:07.488 --> 08:09.388
Long, long relationship

08:09.389 --> 08:11.819
With my now-ex girlfriend.

08:12.725 --> 08:16.085
We went out for 11 years.

08:16.096 --> 08:20.396
And I'm clearly a little
bit swimming right now.

08:20.400 --> 08:22.668
For sure, the last two months,

08:22.669 --> 08:24.799
Even though
I try to be very active.

08:24.805 --> 08:26.335
My normal mode of

08:28.574 --> 08:32.344
Getting rid of problems
is just to work more.

08:33.980 --> 08:36.616
So I did quite a bit of work.

08:36.616 --> 08:38.177
Kept... Tried to keep myself

08:38.184 --> 08:39.745
Very, very busy.

08:39.753 --> 08:41.323
- Yeah, huge fan
of your guys's work,

08:41.323 --> 08:43.089
I follow you all the time.

08:43.090 --> 08:45.958
- We used to
design a lot of Cd covers.

08:45.959 --> 08:47.929
I wanted to
combine my two loves,

08:47.930 --> 08:50.096
Design and music.

08:50.097 --> 08:54.467
Then it turned out that
designing the 28th cover

08:54.468 --> 08:57.098
Wasn't as much fun
as designing the 1st.

08:57.104 --> 08:59.044
- Look at this Cd, look
at how cool that thing is.

08:59.045 --> 09:00.639
How slick is that?

09:00.641 --> 09:02.541
Very, very cool.

09:02.543 --> 09:03.943
- And then I
was just trying to see

09:03.944 --> 09:05.614
If I could apply this language

09:05.615 --> 09:07.346
That I know how to speak,

09:07.347 --> 09:08.547
Graphic design,

09:08.549 --> 09:09.709
To something that was

09:09.716 --> 09:12.776
Actually much more personal.

09:12.786 --> 09:15.216
And I found
this little list in my diary

09:15.222 --> 09:16.956
Of things I've learned

09:16.957 --> 09:18.617
In my life so far.

09:18.625 --> 09:20.525
So I chose some of them.

09:20.527 --> 09:23.957
Designed them as well
as I absolutely could.

09:23.964 --> 09:28.234
So, there is trying to look good

09:28.235 --> 09:30.165
Limits my life.

09:31.470 --> 09:33.339
Everything I do

09:33.340 --> 09:35.970
Always comes back

09:35.976 --> 09:36.906
To me.

09:39.245 --> 09:40.605
Keeping a diary

09:42.014 --> 09:43.583
Supports

09:43.584 --> 09:44.684
Personal

09:44.685 --> 09:45.745
Development.

09:48.421 --> 09:50.821
Even though
my initial feeling was

09:50.824 --> 09:52.764
That it's fairly self-indulgent,

09:52.765 --> 09:56.329
The reaction of the
audience was fantastic.

09:56.330 --> 10:00.330
It became this thing that's
still very graphic design,

10:00.334 --> 10:03.402
But a much more
personal expression.

10:03.403 --> 10:05.241
Look, somebody
is in a good mood.

10:05.242 --> 10:06.938
- I'm so excited.
- Excellent.

10:07.673 --> 10:09.411
The reason I wanted
to work with Jonathan

10:09.412 --> 10:11.779
Is because he deals
with the whole life,

10:11.780 --> 10:14.678
Not just some small,
specialist stuff.

10:14.681 --> 10:17.550
And at the same time,
he's a true scientist.

10:17.551 --> 10:20.551
Everything he says
is backed up by proper

10:20.554 --> 10:23.189
Authoritative research.

10:23.190 --> 10:24.390
- The view that
I came to in writing the

10:24.391 --> 10:26.091
Happiness hypothesis I
didn't have this view

10:26.093 --> 10:28.227
When I started writing,
but by the end of the book,

10:28.228 --> 10:30.196
I came to the conclusion
that happiness doesn't come

10:30.197 --> 10:31.127
From getting what you want.

10:31.131 --> 10:32.961
Well that, everybody knows.

10:32.966 --> 10:34.366
It doesn't come from within.

10:34.368 --> 10:35.268
I mean, that's
what the Buddhists

10:35.269 --> 10:36.428
And the stoics
have always told us.

10:36.436 --> 10:38.536
From within, so, you
know, change yourself,

10:38.538 --> 10:39.638
Find happiness within.

10:39.640 --> 10:40.940
There's some truth to that,

10:40.941 --> 10:44.041
But I think the more correct way

10:44.044 --> 10:45.114
To think about human happiness

10:45.115 --> 10:47.082
Is that happiness comes
from getting the right

10:47.083 --> 10:48.880
Kind of relationships.

10:48.882 --> 10:49.982
Between yourself and others,

10:49.983 --> 10:53.123
And yourself and something
larger than yourself.

10:53.124 --> 10:55.150
Try to almost see yourself

10:55.155 --> 10:56.485
As though you were,

10:56.490 --> 10:58.658
You know, a child or an animal

10:58.659 --> 11:00.626
That you were trying
to change or shape.

11:00.627 --> 11:01.557
And what experiences

11:01.561 --> 11:03.399
Can you give it
that would end up just

11:03.400 --> 11:05.427
Making it automatically
and habitually act

11:05.432 --> 11:06.832
In a different way.

11:35.928 --> 11:37.697
- To make your mind
become strong,

11:37.698 --> 11:39.298
You need exercise.

11:40.266 --> 11:41.926
The exercise of the mind, this

11:41.935 --> 11:44.365
Is what we call meditation.

11:46.773 --> 11:49.341
- The schedule
says wake up at 4:30

11:49.342 --> 11:51.110
And then a full program

11:51.111 --> 11:53.711
All the way 'til 9:15 pm.

11:53.714 --> 11:56.614
Meditation, break,
meditation, break.

11:56.616 --> 11:58.616
Break, meditation, meditation

11:58.618 --> 12:00.986
With strong determination,

12:00.987 --> 12:03.317
Meaning you're not
allowed to move,

12:03.323 --> 12:06.263
Break, lecture,
break, meditation.

12:08.127 --> 12:09.957
At 6:00 in the morning, already

12:09.963 --> 12:12.063
My back hurts like hell.

12:12.898 --> 12:14.898
And at 8:00,
oh, my god,

12:14.901 --> 12:17.101
The pain is totally nuts.

12:18.537 --> 12:21.407
- This is the way
to get happier.

12:22.708 --> 12:27.178
May all beings be happy.

12:29.148 --> 12:33.118
May all beings be happy.

12:35.154 --> 12:39.424
May all beings be happy.

12:40.192 --> 12:41.762
Meditation, stop.

12:42.995 --> 12:45.655
One, two, three, four.

12:45.665 --> 12:47.725
- But the only pleasure

12:47.734 --> 12:49.502
That I experience now

12:49.503 --> 12:51.003
Comes from the time

12:51.004 --> 12:53.104
When the pain goes away.

12:53.839 --> 12:55.908
- One by one,

12:55.909 --> 12:57.009
When you're calm.

12:57.010 --> 12:58.840
May all beings

12:58.845 --> 13:00.345
Be happy.

13:00.347 --> 13:01.847
Fuck.

13:01.848 --> 13:05.118
Five, six, seven, eight.

13:12.458 --> 13:16.428
- I'm surrounded by
a surprisingly mixed group.

13:16.429 --> 13:18.559
A bunch of Jakarta housewives,

13:18.565 --> 13:20.195
A fancy hippie.

13:20.200 --> 13:22.400
An aging surfer dude.

13:22.402 --> 13:24.202
An architect, designer type.

13:24.204 --> 13:28.440
And various women between
the age of 25 and 45

13:28.441 --> 13:31.311
At various degrees
of being lost.

13:33.279 --> 13:36.916
Everybody looks
zombie-like and dour.

13:36.917 --> 13:38.977
If I'm supposed
to get happy here,

13:38.985 --> 13:40.545
Current company does not

13:40.554 --> 13:43.054
Suggest a successful outcome.

13:47.927 --> 13:50.057
Good morning, everybody.

13:50.063 --> 13:52.932
We're going
to continue our practice

13:52.933 --> 13:56.302
To make our
harmonious mind appear.

13:56.303 --> 13:58.070
- Crazy pain,

13:58.071 --> 13:59.401
All night long.

14:00.406 --> 14:02.936
I'm totally ready to give up.

14:03.909 --> 14:06.909
Seven, eight, nine, ten.

14:06.913 --> 14:11.353
One, two, three, four, five.

14:21.093 --> 14:23.803
Just ran into an
old student of mine and

14:23.804 --> 14:28.597
She's joining me and her
friend for dinner later on.

14:28.602 --> 14:31.402
So... Lovely.

14:42.715 --> 14:45.315
Well after failing for awhile,

14:46.285 --> 14:48.515
I am now opening

14:48.521 --> 14:50.051
Up to new things.

14:51.624 --> 14:53.626
It does feel like lots

14:53.627 --> 14:55.457
Of stuff is possible.

15:03.068 --> 15:06.838
And I think even
Tanya is impressed.

15:18.484 --> 15:19.424
I'm bored.

15:21.553 --> 15:25.763
Sunday and I'm bored.

15:28.827 --> 15:30.257
I was reading all afternoon

15:30.263 --> 15:32.603
And I will do a little bit
of work now,

15:32.604 --> 15:34.999
Because I don't know, really,

15:35.001 --> 15:36.941
What else I should do.

15:47.613 --> 15:50.053
My Mom, whom I loved dearly,

15:50.883 --> 15:52.223
Died this year.

15:54.186 --> 15:56.616
She used to work
in a store all her life,

15:56.623 --> 15:58.691
And going up to people,

15:58.692 --> 16:01.627
Making that first step
really became easy

16:01.628 --> 16:04.628
As she got totally used to it.

16:04.631 --> 16:09.468
I, myself, could still get
much, much better at that.

16:09.469 --> 16:13.706
This, this line and this
line, same distance?

16:13.707 --> 16:14.637
"T" here.

16:14.641 --> 16:19.141
I'm extremely anxious
about this dance piece.

16:19.145 --> 16:20.905
Choreographing dancers

16:20.914 --> 16:22.381
Is fairly far away

16:22.382 --> 16:24.950
From straightforward
graphic design.

16:24.951 --> 16:26.481
The "e" moves back.

16:28.087 --> 16:29.747
It's always the same.

16:29.756 --> 16:31.916
If I've done it before,
I get bored.

16:31.925 --> 16:35.655
If I haven't done it
before, I get anxious.

16:40.966 --> 16:43.596
A couple of years ago,
Hillman had made a

16:43.603 --> 16:45.403
Short portrait of me.

16:45.738 --> 16:48.407
And I immediately thought,

16:48.408 --> 16:50.776
I could be friends
with this guy.

16:50.777 --> 16:53.846
- So, I would choose the
letters where it made sense.

16:53.847 --> 16:54.677
Do you know what I mean?

16:54.681 --> 16:56.111
- Yeah.

16:56.949 --> 16:59.719
Unlike me, he's calm and gentle.

17:01.587 --> 17:03.347
We make a good team.

17:04.256 --> 17:05.185
M, yes!

17:06.358 --> 17:07.288
A, yes!

17:08.493 --> 17:09.434
K, yes!

17:10.628 --> 17:11.559
E, no!

18:15.994 --> 18:18.397
What a crazy weekend.

18:18.398 --> 18:20.328
I spent it with Tanya in

18:20.333 --> 18:23.333
A hotel down south
in Alila Uluwatu.

18:23.336 --> 18:24.996
And I mean, of course, yeah,

18:25.004 --> 18:27.114
It can't be much better.

18:29.241 --> 18:30.511
What a lovely, lovely, lovely,

18:30.512 --> 18:32.880
Lovely, lovely girl she is.

18:33.612 --> 18:36.512
Sadly, she doesn't
want to be filmed.

18:36.516 --> 18:38.716
She thinks I share too much

18:38.718 --> 18:41.218
Private stuff with everybody.

18:51.530 --> 18:53.970
I think I'm falling for her.

18:55.868 --> 18:58.798
Yeah, I think
I'm falling in love.

19:04.710 --> 19:08.980
Just coming back from an
incredible weekend with Tanya.

19:11.550 --> 19:14.820
I'm really in love,
and I told her so.

19:15.888 --> 19:19.218
I'd say that if she
would leave me now,

19:21.059 --> 19:24.496
Then I'd definitely
have that broken heart

19:24.497 --> 19:26.097
That Jonathan Haidt thought

19:26.099 --> 19:28.429
Would be good for the film.

19:38.177 --> 19:40.846
There was a meditation
on love and kindness.

19:40.847 --> 19:44.917
And I meditated on

19:44.918 --> 19:47.348
The fact that I'm gonna die.

19:51.523 --> 19:54.826
And I think I really

19:54.827 --> 19:58.927
Don't wanna
just dedicate the next

19:58.932 --> 20:02.501
20 years of my life
also to design,

20:02.502 --> 20:05.042
As I've basically been doing.

20:13.178 --> 20:17.178
Yeah, I definitely
had an insight.

20:17.183 --> 20:20.819
The insight is that
I really want kids.

20:20.820 --> 20:21.720
It's a big deal.

20:21.721 --> 20:24.856
That would be for me, my god...

20:24.857 --> 20:26.287
It's a big deal.

20:28.460 --> 20:32.660
And I'll see how
Tanya feels about this.

20:49.915 --> 20:51.215
Crazy.

20:51.217 --> 20:52.747
I'm in Hong Kong.

20:53.518 --> 20:55.087
And things are amazing.

20:55.088 --> 20:58.056
Of course,
now that I'm not looking

20:58.057 --> 20:59.787
For a girl,

21:00.659 --> 21:02.359
They are all over me.

21:02.362 --> 21:04.596
Maybe like the most ever.

21:04.597 --> 21:06.057
There was this
pretty blonde girl

21:06.065 --> 21:09.165
Who in a second, sat on my lap.

21:09.168 --> 21:10.836
And just to make sure

21:10.837 --> 21:13.537
That I actually
heard her correctly,

21:13.539 --> 21:16.908
I said, did you
just offer me a trial run

21:16.909 --> 21:18.539
To sleep with you?

21:18.544 --> 21:19.944
And she said,

21:19.946 --> 21:21.006
Well, I might have,

21:21.014 --> 21:24.182
You have to seduce me
a little bit before.

21:24.183 --> 21:25.751
And it took, as it was,

21:25.752 --> 21:28.692
Quite some self-discipline
not to.

21:30.622 --> 21:31.562
Crazy.

21:39.364 --> 21:43.374
I do think
I could be a good Dad.

21:44.903 --> 21:47.139
And on the other hand,

21:47.140 --> 21:48.140
If I would have a

21:48.141 --> 21:50.141
Family just for the thrill.

21:50.143 --> 21:52.913
Oh, my god, that would be awful.

21:59.084 --> 22:02.387
I'm not sure
if she's pissed at me.

22:02.388 --> 22:03.318
Who knows?

22:03.323 --> 22:08.160
It for sure would be
understandable considering

22:08.161 --> 22:12.431
That the child issue surely
is a deal-breaker for her.

22:13.932 --> 22:16.101
I think that's more my problem

22:16.102 --> 22:18.170
Than it is a reflection of

22:18.171 --> 22:20.439
The true situation with Tanya.

22:20.440 --> 22:22.407
But it's constantly like,

22:22.408 --> 22:26.578
Oh, we are so different.
Oh, she is so irrational.

22:26.579 --> 22:30.609
Oh, we have a
difference of common sense.

22:30.616 --> 22:35.416
In a very, very difficult
situation with her,

22:37.255 --> 22:41.255
Because I couldn't count
on her acting rationally.

22:41.260 --> 22:42.928
And it's difficult to get

22:42.929 --> 22:45.599
These thoughts out of my brain.

22:47.599 --> 22:50.699
I mean, we are
a month into it basically.

22:50.703 --> 22:55.213
And there is already

22:56.942 --> 22:58.312
Serious strife.

23:00.112 --> 23:01.052
Serious.

23:03.782 --> 23:04.952
I'm basically

23:06.952 --> 23:09.792
Out of my depth.

23:12.290 --> 23:13.790
She cried.

23:16.061 --> 23:17.831
I'm just really sad.

23:32.378 --> 23:35.647
- It is intimacy
with the ordinary conditions

23:35.648 --> 23:37.648
Of life that allow meditation

23:37.650 --> 23:39.217
To arise naturally,

23:39.218 --> 23:43.248
And then you find yourself
in meditation.

23:43.256 --> 23:44.916
And not while I'm sitting

23:44.924 --> 23:46.558
In my meditation hut

23:46.559 --> 23:48.427
Trying, sitting still.

23:48.428 --> 23:49.988
- Yeah, well,
there's the word trying.

23:49.996 --> 23:52.696
The trying is the problem.

23:52.698 --> 23:53.998
'Cause you're trying
to get somewhere

23:54.000 --> 23:56.330
As if you're not somewhere.

23:59.171 --> 24:02.841
- I actually
found a repeatable way

24:02.842 --> 24:05.442
To manufacture a happy Moment.

24:08.747 --> 24:12.677
<i>♪ I think I know how I feel ♪</i>

24:16.855 --> 24:23.625
<i>♪ cause I-I only
play for real ♪</i>

24:26.031 --> 24:29.971
<i>♪ You should be picking me up ♪</i>

24:31.703 --> 24:35.873
<i>♪ instead you're
dragging me down ♪</i>

24:37.576 --> 24:40.846
<i>♪ You're flying over my head ♪</i>

24:43.448 --> 24:47.488
<i>♪ you're landing all over town ♪</i>

24:48.887 --> 24:52.817
<i>♪ you should be picking me up ♪</i>

24:54.793 --> 24:59.563
<i>♪ instead you're
dragging me down ♪</i>

24:59.565 --> 25:01.625
- What is it
that leads to a change

25:01.634 --> 25:03.772
In the way that you
engage with people?

25:03.773 --> 25:04.899
From last time we spoke,

25:04.904 --> 25:06.673
It was clear to me
that your issue

25:06.674 --> 25:08.272
Isn't happiness per say.

25:08.274 --> 25:09.112
And that issues were

25:09.113 --> 25:10.008
Really much more
about connection

25:10.009 --> 25:11.479
With other people,
and some of the

25:11.480 --> 25:13.737
Warm, loving skills.

25:13.746 --> 25:15.306
There's actually
one other element here

25:15.314 --> 25:16.448
That we should bring

25:16.449 --> 25:17.619
In, is the fact
that you were living

25:17.620 --> 25:19.147
In a foreign country.

25:19.151 --> 25:20.351
It sounds like we have

25:20.353 --> 25:21.453
Not just the meditation,

25:21.454 --> 25:23.023
But we have being
in a new place.

25:23.024 --> 25:25.592
- In a place in which
you don't know people,

25:25.593 --> 25:27.160
So you're forced
to be more open.

25:27.161 --> 25:29.429
In a place that
the pace of life of which

25:29.430 --> 25:31.928
Is much, much slower
than in new york.

25:31.931 --> 25:33.961
And in a place which is
physically very beautiful,

25:33.966 --> 25:35.526
And in a very green,
natural way.

25:35.535 --> 25:37.835
So all of these things
are adding up

25:37.837 --> 25:40.437
To sort of suppress the sort of,

25:40.439 --> 25:42.869
The time pressure,

25:42.875 --> 25:45.605
You know, task-focused
Stefan Sagmeister.

25:45.611 --> 25:47.111
And bring out to the greatest

25:47.113 --> 25:48.450
Extent that you're capable

25:48.451 --> 25:51.877
Of the more warm, loving
and open Stefan Sagmeister.

25:51.884 --> 25:53.784
So it's going to be very
difficult for us to figure out

25:53.786 --> 25:56.386
Whether the meditation
played any role whatsoever.

25:56.389 --> 25:59.658
What we're seeing here is
that you're really high

25:59.659 --> 26:02.227
In a trait called systemizing.

26:02.228 --> 26:05.196
And systemizing is the ability

26:05.197 --> 26:08.166
And skill of seeing things
as systems

26:08.167 --> 26:10.827
Which can be graphed
and manipulated.

26:10.836 --> 26:13.896
And systemizing is at
least slightly correlated

26:13.906 --> 26:15.736
Negatively with empathizing.

26:15.741 --> 26:19.041
And so this is
a systemizer's attempt

26:19.045 --> 26:21.905
To make himself
more empathizing.

26:32.324 --> 26:36.094
- So, Jonathan talks in his book

26:36.095 --> 26:39.295
About this metaphor for

26:41.032 --> 26:43.001
Unconscious
and the conscious minds.

26:43.002 --> 26:45.902
The conscious mind being
the tiny little rider

26:45.905 --> 26:49.005
On the giant elephant,
the unconscious.

26:49.008 --> 26:51.008
And the rider thinks that
he can tell the elephant

26:51.010 --> 26:52.840
What to do and where to go.

26:52.845 --> 26:54.775
But the elephant, of course,

26:54.780 --> 26:57.050
Has his own sort of ideas.

27:00.186 --> 27:01.346
And it's quite strange

27:01.354 --> 27:02.894
That even though we think

27:02.895 --> 27:06.418
That we make
our decisions rationally,

27:06.425 --> 27:09.185
If you look at
a guy called George.

27:09.195 --> 27:11.855
He doesn't quite know
where to move to,

27:11.864 --> 27:15.600
Somehow Georgia
sounds best for George.

27:15.601 --> 27:19.201
And if you have
a guy called Dennis,

27:19.205 --> 27:20.035
He doesn't know if he wants to

27:20.039 --> 27:22.139
Become a doctor or a teacher,

27:22.141 --> 27:25.411
Somehow dentist
sounds best to Dennis.

27:26.411 --> 27:29.851
And Paula,
unsure to marry jack or Paul.

27:31.282 --> 27:33.718
Paul it is for Paula.

27:33.719 --> 27:35.787
And that's the strange thing.

27:35.788 --> 27:37.448
We think we make
these decisions,

27:37.456 --> 27:40.056
But you have data in the us

27:40.059 --> 27:41.989
That there are more Georges

27:41.994 --> 27:43.762
Who live in Georgia,

27:43.763 --> 27:45.330
There are more Dennises

27:45.331 --> 27:47.061
Who become Dentists,

27:47.066 --> 27:48.966
And there are more Paulas

27:48.968 --> 27:50.828
That are married to Pauls

27:50.836 --> 27:52.796
Than would be
statistically viable.

27:52.805 --> 27:57.305
Now, when I first saw that
data I thought, you know,

27:57.309 --> 27:58.779
These stupid Americans.

27:58.780 --> 28:02.848
Ah, they really don't know
what they're doing.

28:04.082 --> 28:05.782
Somehow they are, you know,

28:05.785 --> 28:08.485
Led around by their elephant.

28:08.487 --> 28:11.287
Then I looked at my own family.

28:11.290 --> 28:15.060
That's my Mom Karolina
marrying my Dad Karl.

28:16.795 --> 28:21.065
My Grandmother Josephine
marrying my Dranddad Josef.

28:23.435 --> 28:27.265
So, I'm still looking
for that Stefanie.

28:42.554 --> 28:46.391
So, yeah, what I normally
do on Monday mornings

28:46.392 --> 28:49.227
Is this weekly rating thing.

28:49.228 --> 28:51.058
I've been doing it
for years and years.

28:51.063 --> 28:54.532
It's basically 12 things that

28:54.533 --> 28:55.973
I'm gonna change about myself.

28:55.974 --> 28:58.968
So, one, I've been really,
really good.

28:58.971 --> 29:01.171
Five, I've been really,
really bad.

29:01.173 --> 29:04.876
First one, don't drink alcohol,
was one.

29:04.877 --> 29:07.707
That I'm gutsy once a week.

29:07.713 --> 29:09.913
Last week,
I don't think I was very gutsy,

29:09.915 --> 29:13.845
But I'll have to go back
and check.

29:13.853 --> 29:15.923
Okay, there was this
Guggenheim gala

29:15.924 --> 29:18.791
Where I did go up
to some people.

29:19.924 --> 29:20.924
Not all that successful,

29:20.926 --> 29:22.756
But at least I did.

29:22.762 --> 29:26.231
Helping somebody, I was
actually good last week.

29:26.232 --> 29:28.832
Do something with my friends,
also a two.

29:28.834 --> 29:31.774
Flexible, I don't think
I was all that flexible.

29:31.775 --> 29:34.038
So that gets, so that will be a

29:34.039 --> 29:35.769
One, a two, five.

29:35.775 --> 29:38.735
26 divided by 12.

29:38.744 --> 29:41.614
2.1, okay, so that's
not too bad.

29:44.182 --> 29:45.917
Yeah, I think
that's pretty good.

29:45.918 --> 29:47.178
Oh, and then one
that I left out here

29:47.186 --> 29:49.016
Because I was too
embarrassed about it

29:49.021 --> 29:51.456
Was that I wouldn't
date any girls

29:51.457 --> 29:55.857
That are more than 20
years younger than I am.

29:55.861 --> 29:57.591
In weeks when
I was good at these things,

29:57.596 --> 29:58.926
When I got good marks, it's

29:58.931 --> 30:00.861
Always been a happy week.

30:00.866 --> 30:02.926
And then I got bad marks,

30:02.935 --> 30:05.195
It's been an unhappy week.

30:23.621 --> 30:25.390
Jonathan introduced me

30:25.391 --> 30:29.160
To some very high end
cognitive therapists.

30:29.161 --> 30:30.091
I met up with them,

30:30.095 --> 30:32.395
And hated them all.

30:32.398 --> 30:36.228
Then a friend introduced me
to Sheenah.

30:36.235 --> 30:37.995
I liked her.

30:38.003 --> 30:39.503
- How are you?
- - I'm good.

30:39.737 --> 30:42.887
I, myself, have never
been in therapy before.

30:42.912 --> 30:43.937
Right.

30:43.943 --> 30:45.412
- I'm not sure if I'm a

30:45.413 --> 30:47.411
Particularly fantastic candidate

30:47.413 --> 30:50.413
For therapy, considering that

30:50.416 --> 30:52.276
For a big part of my life

30:52.284 --> 30:54.619
I've been fairly happy.

30:54.620 --> 30:57.320
When I first met Sheenah
I asked her,

30:57.323 --> 31:00.692
Is it reasonable to expect

31:00.693 --> 31:02.993
Some change after three months?

31:02.995 --> 31:05.825
And she said, well, if you
just talk and do nothing,

31:05.831 --> 31:06.961
Probably not.

31:06.966 --> 31:10.966
If you do the homework and
train yourself in that,

31:10.970 --> 31:12.870
It probably will work.

31:16.541 --> 31:21.011
My memories of my childhood
are incredibly happy.

31:21.013 --> 31:25.116
My parents had
an unbelievable marriage.

31:25.117 --> 31:28.117
I don't remember a single fight

31:28.120 --> 31:30.890
Or even bad feelings in the air.

31:31.789 --> 31:33.558
- Oh, look at that.

31:33.559 --> 31:37.159
That's a beautiful picture
of you and her.

31:38.463 --> 31:40.732
Now, you come from a very
close, loving family.

31:40.733 --> 31:43.503
- Mm-hm.
- There's not much history of conflict.

31:43.504 --> 31:45.640
There wasn't much model for it
growing up.

31:45.641 --> 31:48.468
- Here's something
that I was thinking about,

31:48.474 --> 31:51.174
Is that you're 49 and
you've never married.

31:51.176 --> 31:54.976
- And I've found that all
single people who say to me,

31:54.980 --> 31:58.549
I can't understand why I
really don't have a family,

31:58.550 --> 32:00.650
Why is this?

32:00.653 --> 32:04.689
All of them tend
to be passive pleasers.

32:04.690 --> 32:07.060
Because you tend
to avoid conflict.

32:07.061 --> 32:10.528
- Yes, I think that accurate.
- Right.

32:10.529 --> 32:14.059
- So what would you say
would be a remedy for that?

32:14.066 --> 32:17.666
- I believe in dealing with
conflict well and elegantly.

32:17.670 --> 32:19.000
And respectfully.

32:19.004 --> 32:22.874
It would be good practice
for you to do that.

32:25.343 --> 32:27.078
- Even before I saw Sheenah,

32:27.079 --> 32:28.009
I've been trying to get

32:28.013 --> 32:30.181
Better with everyday things.

32:30.182 --> 32:32.652
Things I'm almost embarrassed

32:33.451 --> 32:36.121
That I need to talk about them.

32:37.388 --> 32:39.557
Things like if I want
a coffee on the street

32:39.558 --> 32:40.888
And I see somebody
with a coffee,

32:40.893 --> 32:41.793
Just ask that person,

32:41.794 --> 32:42.734
Where did you get it,

32:42.735 --> 32:45.228
Rather than finding it myself.

32:45.230 --> 32:49.230
Or telling a taxi driver
to turn the radio down

32:49.234 --> 32:50.802
If it bothers me.

32:50.803 --> 32:53.703
You know, I've been
known to sit in a taxi

32:53.706 --> 32:56.036
And just endure it.

32:56.041 --> 32:57.909
That's perfect, thanks.

32:57.910 --> 33:01.040
Do you have any idea
of other homework

33:01.046 --> 33:03.276
That I could do?

33:03.282 --> 33:05.882
- I think we should pick things
that you would avoid doing.

33:05.884 --> 33:09.087
What kind of things
do you avoid doing?

33:09.088 --> 33:10.888
Cause I do believe
in seeking discomfort

33:10.889 --> 33:13.819
As a great way
to grow confidence.

33:22.734 --> 33:23.834
- Hi, sorry for interrupting,

33:23.836 --> 33:26.766
But you just look fantastic.

33:26.772 --> 33:27.742
I love your outfit,

33:27.743 --> 33:30.240
You just look great.

33:30.242 --> 33:31.642
That's some serious amount of

33:31.643 --> 33:33.043
Apples that you have there.

33:35.413 --> 33:37.181
- So I'm gonna do things

33:37.182 --> 33:39.382
That I normally never do.

33:40.118 --> 33:42.118
And some, probably
the most difficult one

33:42.121 --> 33:43.991
Is going to be to get a
phone number of a girl.

33:43.992 --> 33:46.489
Which is just
gonna be terrifying,

33:46.492 --> 33:48.092
Because I never
do that on the street.

33:48.093 --> 33:49.927
I just never do.

33:49.928 --> 33:52.628
So just thinking about it

33:52.631 --> 33:54.801
Now and talking about it,

33:55.933 --> 33:58.036
Yeah, makes me queasy

33:58.037 --> 33:59.937
To say the least.

33:59.938 --> 34:01.806
Wow, I love that bag.

34:01.807 --> 34:04.137
Excuse me, I love that bag.

34:05.343 --> 34:08.780
I'm not getting very
far with my compliments.

34:08.781 --> 34:11.821
- People are so used to
being approached here.

34:11.822 --> 34:15.947
- Do you ever approach
people on the street?

34:15.954 --> 34:17.789
- No.
- Me neither.

34:17.790 --> 34:19.460
- I never do.
- Yeah, no, no, me neither.

34:19.460 --> 34:21.626
- This blonde?
- You want to try?

34:21.627 --> 34:22.827
- Not really.

34:25.295 --> 34:27.426
- She looks mean.
- Yeah.

34:29.967 --> 34:31.127
- Can I give you a flower?

34:31.136 --> 34:32.795
- Oh, it's...
- no, but look, look,

34:32.804 --> 34:33.965
It matches perfectly.

34:33.972 --> 34:36.741
- Thanks a lot, thanks a lot.
- Yeah? Thank you.

34:36.742 --> 34:38.179
I'm sorry, I see you're texting

34:38.181 --> 34:40.507
But I just have to comment
on your jacket.

34:40.512 --> 34:42.150
That is just the nicest jacket.

34:42.150 --> 34:44.147
You absolutely look fantastic.

34:44.149 --> 34:45.978
- Yeah, yeah.
- Oh, well, thank you.

34:45.984 --> 34:48.585
I would love to get
together for a cup of coffee

34:48.587 --> 34:49.487
At one time.

34:49.487 --> 34:51.558
- Look, and I have
a flower for you.

34:51.559 --> 34:52.587
- Oh, thank you.

34:52.591 --> 34:54.491
- Excellent.
- They're beautiful.

34:54.493 --> 34:58.830
- That was the first one that
halfway decently worked out.

34:58.831 --> 35:00.731
I didn't quite have
the guts to further,

35:00.732 --> 35:02.502
To really ask her
for her phone number

35:02.503 --> 35:04.331
After she accepted,
graciously, my card.

35:04.336 --> 35:06.096
But I wouldn't,
the way she reacted,

35:06.105 --> 35:10.965
If I would actually get
an email from Christie.

35:12.677 --> 35:14.947
I would say, at least from

35:15.780 --> 35:18.080
A judgement of American society,

35:18.083 --> 35:19.083
I clearly must have some

35:19.084 --> 35:22.687
Sort of commitment issues.

35:22.688 --> 35:24.018
At least, if I talk to girls...

35:24.022 --> 35:26.192
- They're going to tell you
that within five minutes.

35:26.193 --> 35:28.191
- I think that I have
commitment issues.

35:28.193 --> 35:30.693
I did have, of course, a
very long relationship.

35:30.696 --> 35:31.526
- You did?

35:31.530 --> 35:35.430
I went out with Anni
for 11 years.

35:35.434 --> 35:36.674
- You did?
- Yeah.

35:38.536 --> 35:40.466
We were friends
for many, many years

35:40.472 --> 35:41.772
Before we started dating.

35:41.773 --> 35:44.876
And we had a quite
wonderful relationship,

35:44.877 --> 35:48.077
But towards the end,
we really sort of got

35:48.080 --> 35:50.110
On each others' nerves.

35:50.115 --> 35:51.745
Mostly small things.

35:51.750 --> 35:57.020
I could never really figure
out how that happened.

35:58.556 --> 36:02.226
Did she start to do things
she never did before?

36:02.227 --> 36:06.257
Or am I now getting
agitated about stuff I used

36:06.265 --> 36:07.695
To be fine with?

36:09.500 --> 36:11.840
And I'd say that right now,

36:15.806 --> 36:17.506
I'm not sure if it was a

36:17.509 --> 36:19.779
Good idea to break it off.

36:20.978 --> 36:22.108
But I can say this.

36:22.114 --> 36:23.784
I of course am a big list-maker.

36:23.785 --> 36:26.250
I have also made lists of

36:26.251 --> 36:28.819
- Positives and negatives.
- Negatives.

36:28.820 --> 36:32.256
- Yes and it was
just a little bit

36:32.257 --> 36:33.817
More negatives than positives.

36:33.825 --> 36:35.325
And I recently went

36:35.327 --> 36:36.627
Back into the diary

36:36.628 --> 36:38.796
And saw those lists again and...

36:38.797 --> 36:41.157
- What did you see?

36:41.166 --> 36:42.926
- I saw that I

36:42.935 --> 36:45.595
Left out a good number of

36:45.604 --> 36:47.638
Positives that I would see now.

36:47.639 --> 36:48.607
- Really?

36:48.608 --> 36:49.607
Yeah.

36:49.608 --> 36:50.968
That there were

36:51.776 --> 36:54.106
Things that I didn't
give her any credit for,

36:54.112 --> 36:56.612
That she clearly would
have deserved credit.

36:56.615 --> 36:57.445
That I basically

36:57.449 --> 36:59.116
Took for granted.

36:59.117 --> 37:01.147
Let's say that last
pro and con list,

37:01.153 --> 37:02.653
Done from today's point of view,

37:02.654 --> 37:05.324
Would look radically different.

37:07.291 --> 37:08.491
One thing that I think

37:08.493 --> 37:10.893
Initially took guts was the

37:12.296 --> 37:14.356
The opening card
of the studio itself.

37:14.366 --> 37:17.466
This was, I think, 17 years ago.

37:17.469 --> 37:20.399
And it was just
a stupid little joke.

37:20.405 --> 37:23.135
My girlfriend at the time
thought that,

37:23.141 --> 37:26.677
Oh, I'm going to
lose the one client

37:26.678 --> 37:28.508
By sending this out.

37:28.513 --> 37:30.681
But there were one or two

37:30.682 --> 37:31.982
Other clients that followed.

37:31.984 --> 37:33.984
So, it actually worked.

37:35.820 --> 37:38.089
Shit, no, shit, it would
have to be much higher.

37:38.090 --> 37:39.020
Fuck.

37:43.494 --> 37:45.201
You see, like the distance
between the H

37:45.202 --> 37:46.827
And the a is now too big.

37:46.832 --> 37:48.001
- Okay, the one thing

37:48.002 --> 37:49.330
That we haven't tried,

37:49.334 --> 37:51.504
Which would, again, take
probably five, 10 minutes

37:51.505 --> 37:55.573
If we didn't talk to
each other, at all.

37:55.574 --> 37:57.341
Hillman was a rock star.

37:57.342 --> 37:59.442
And I don't mean this
metaphorically.

37:59.444 --> 38:03.614
I mean he had a major
label recording contract.

38:03.615 --> 38:06.215
And he'd toured for 10 years.

38:06.218 --> 38:07.918
And how do I know about this?

38:07.919 --> 38:09.289
From Wikipedia.

38:10.354 --> 38:14.024
He, himself never really
talks about it.

38:14.026 --> 38:15.356
- I would say
if we're gonna do it,

38:15.360 --> 38:18.696
I don't think there's
any real point in doing it,

38:18.697 --> 38:19.697
When we can do it with...

38:19.698 --> 38:20.528
you're gonna be right,

38:20.532 --> 38:21.362
You're gonna be right.

38:21.366 --> 38:22.696
But just give me
like five minutes.

38:22.701 --> 38:23.870
We won't even say anything.

38:23.871 --> 38:26.599
Just let me see the
"having" as it was before.

38:26.605 --> 38:27.795
Where we were.

38:27.806 --> 38:29.266
And there might

38:29.274 --> 38:32.814
Be some surprising
new thing that happens.

38:40.117 --> 38:42.286
- Well, Sheenah thinks
I should be less cautious

38:42.287 --> 38:44.047
In my relationships.

38:45.389 --> 38:47.458
And I have been infatuated

38:47.459 --> 38:49.489
With a very private woman

38:49.494 --> 38:51.729
In my hometown in Austria

38:51.730 --> 38:54.398
For a very long time now.

38:54.399 --> 38:56.467
And she would hate to be

38:56.468 --> 38:58.168
Mentioned in this film.

38:58.170 --> 39:01.170
So I'll just call her
miss private.

39:06.777 --> 39:08.746
When I think of her,
it's never sexual

39:08.747 --> 39:12.917
It's always about some
smart thing she said

39:12.918 --> 39:15.918
Or some nice thing
that she's done.

39:17.355 --> 39:19.655
I'm going to Austria right now

39:19.658 --> 39:24.258
And let's see,
maybe I finally get

39:24.262 --> 39:28.262
My shit together
and I'll be able to tell her.

40:33.397 --> 40:35.497
Of course, miss private came.

40:35.500 --> 40:37.370
- Miss private, yeah.

40:39.670 --> 40:42.670
- She told me that
she made some decisions,

40:42.674 --> 40:47.011
That she has to stop that
safe, mousy life back home.

40:47.012 --> 40:47.842
- Oh, really?

40:47.846 --> 40:50.446
And I sort of looked
at her and said, well,

40:50.449 --> 40:52.079
That, uh, that sounds

40:52.083 --> 40:54.283
Pretty good for my cause.

40:55.219 --> 40:57.349
Then we kissed and

40:57.355 --> 40:59.855
It basically went from there.

41:01.425 --> 41:04.185
She was here in a week when
new york was at its finest.

41:04.196 --> 41:05.196
Like, you know,

41:05.197 --> 41:06.027
- Oh, I do.

41:06.031 --> 41:10.731
It was super warm, the sun
was shining every single day.

41:10.735 --> 41:12.695
And I feel that it was

41:12.704 --> 41:14.204
More new york than me

41:14.206 --> 41:15.266
Who won her over.

41:15.273 --> 41:17.143
New york was so much on my side.

41:17.144 --> 41:18.582
- Yeah.
- - that's your rival.

41:18.583 --> 41:21.137
- Yes, yeah.

41:40.564 --> 41:41.974
- 2:00, okay, perfect.

41:41.975 --> 41:43.227
Okay, goodbye.

41:44.735 --> 41:46.095
He'll be here at 2:00.

41:46.104 --> 41:47.438
- Oh, excellent.

41:47.439 --> 41:49.169
The institute for contemporary
art in Philadelphia

41:49.174 --> 41:51.574
Invited us to create an exhibit.

41:51.576 --> 41:54.836
I immediately thought, this
could be about happiness.

41:54.846 --> 41:56.176
The happy show.

41:57.081 --> 41:59.081
I've been doing promotional

41:59.084 --> 42:01.584
Things for so long now.

42:01.586 --> 42:04.246
This could be
a great possibility

42:04.256 --> 42:06.156
To use the language of design

42:06.157 --> 42:08.587
For something more personal.

42:16.600 --> 42:18.869
When she stayed over

42:18.870 --> 42:22.310
Like, for me,
it was oddly friendshippy.

42:23.107 --> 42:23.937
- Really?

42:23.942 --> 42:24.772
- Yeah.

42:24.776 --> 42:26.376
- Not passionate.
- Passionate.

42:26.378 --> 42:29.678
- And oddly companionate.

42:29.681 --> 42:30.611
- Mm-hmm.

42:30.615 --> 42:31.675
- I mean, you know,

42:31.683 --> 42:33.483
Even down to the the point

42:33.485 --> 42:35.785
That she smelled very familiar.

42:35.787 --> 42:37.987
Or more particularly, she
smelled like my sister.

42:37.989 --> 42:41.458
But on the other hand
it's also not so sexy.

42:41.459 --> 42:43.659
- It's not sexy at all.

42:43.662 --> 42:47.131
- This represents
what it would look like

42:47.132 --> 42:48.632
When it's a generated

42:48.633 --> 42:51.233
Pedal power, okay?

42:52.202 --> 42:56.072
- Her concern was
that I'm very, very rational.

42:56.074 --> 42:58.142
Actually, too rational for her.

42:58.143 --> 43:02.313
And I make this whole
relationship so rational.

43:02.314 --> 43:05.014
Yeah, it's just not
emotional enough for her.

43:05.016 --> 43:06.846
- And what does
she exactly mean by that?

43:06.851 --> 43:08.521
- I think what she means by it

43:08.522 --> 43:11.090
Is that there is probably not

43:12.923 --> 43:14.523
I don't know, enough gazing

43:14.526 --> 43:16.056
Into each others eyes.

43:16.061 --> 43:17.331
- Romance, you mean?

43:17.332 --> 43:23.329
If there is such a thing
as passionate love,

43:23.335 --> 43:26.995
I am not in passionate
love with miss private.

43:27.005 --> 43:28.235
- So, she senses that?

43:28.239 --> 43:29.269
- Yes.

43:29.274 --> 43:30.544
- Yes.
- - yeah.

43:32.376 --> 43:34.076
I'm trying to get like
a perfect packed one.

43:34.079 --> 43:35.509
So, the end is the test.

43:35.513 --> 43:36.853
- That looks nice too, though.

43:36.854 --> 43:39.178
Using them like this.

43:39.184 --> 43:40.517
- Yeah, yep.

43:40.518 --> 43:41.848
- Fine, let's go
for the coffees.

43:41.853 --> 43:42.793
Yes, yeah.

43:43.687 --> 43:45.387
Hillman is very sick.

43:45.390 --> 43:46.820
You're okay now?

43:49.593 --> 43:52.363
He does not wanna talk about it.

43:53.364 --> 43:56.433
He's been absent a lot lately,

43:56.434 --> 44:00.474
And the whole team has
been avoiding the issue.

44:03.307 --> 44:06.707
I'm not quite sure
how to bring it up.

44:06.711 --> 44:07.811
I was missing you badly,

44:07.812 --> 44:10.482
And missing the input badly.

44:43.814 --> 44:45.114
- I want you to be involved

44:45.116 --> 44:49.086
Every single step of the way.

44:49.087 --> 44:50.517
- On all things.

44:50.522 --> 44:53.422
I'm extremely aware that
the little graphic shots

44:53.425 --> 44:55.085
Are not gonna make the movie.

44:55.093 --> 44:55.933
They're gonna be sweet

44:55.934 --> 44:59.296
Nice little things, the
movie will need a story.

44:59.297 --> 45:00.797
And it needs to be emotional.

45:00.799 --> 45:04.799
And I think that I'm very
much relying on you for that.

45:18.115 --> 45:22.385
- So miss private
and I split up.

45:22.387 --> 45:23.217
- You did?

45:23.221 --> 45:28.621
She said, well, I think
we both made up our minds.

45:28.626 --> 45:31.956
And we clearly both knew
what she was talking about.

45:31.963 --> 45:33.997
Ultimately my guess would

45:33.998 --> 45:35.398
Be that that is, you know,

45:35.400 --> 45:39.837
Just another boring
fear of commitment.

45:39.838 --> 45:40.968
- I think I called it trapped,

45:40.972 --> 45:42.239
And you called it bound.

45:42.240 --> 45:43.140
Do you remember that?

45:43.141 --> 45:46.041
- I think you have a big
fear of being trapped

45:46.044 --> 45:48.644
In a conflictual situation.

45:48.646 --> 45:51.746
And most people
who avoid commitment

45:52.483 --> 45:54.683
Are really avoiding conflict.

45:54.686 --> 45:57.686
- It's strange, I know with
people that work with me,

45:57.689 --> 45:59.757
After 10 minutes,

45:59.758 --> 46:01.258
No problem at all.

46:01.259 --> 46:03.327
And I've not been somebody

46:03.328 --> 46:07.397
Who falls in love
at first sight at all.

46:07.398 --> 46:08.998
You have a lot of caution.

46:09.000 --> 46:10.500
- Yep.

46:10.502 --> 46:12.671
- A lot of caution
about falling in love.

46:12.672 --> 46:14.700
Maybe not about
everything in life,

46:14.706 --> 46:17.806
But certainly
about falling in love.

46:20.377 --> 46:22.207
- I guess,
you know, what I'm trying

46:22.213 --> 46:23.383
To figure out here is
whether something about

46:23.384 --> 46:24.781
You or your strengths,

46:24.783 --> 46:26.183
The way you live your life,

46:26.184 --> 46:27.684
Makes it simply difficult
for you to connect

46:27.685 --> 46:29.345
Deeply with women.

46:29.354 --> 46:30.194
- Yeah.

46:30.195 --> 46:32.358
And that's why
we call it falling.

46:32.359 --> 46:33.717
You don't have to choose fall.

46:33.725 --> 46:36.755
You're just walking along
and you fall.

46:36.761 --> 46:40.361
It's developing a long term
companionate love relationship,

46:40.365 --> 46:41.795
That's what's harder.

46:41.800 --> 46:44.070
- So, do you think that...

46:46.870 --> 46:49.370
That's the question,
do you think that a long term

46:49.374 --> 46:51.712
Companionate relationship
is possible without the

46:51.713 --> 46:53.409
Passion that comes up front...

46:53.411 --> 46:54.611
- Absolutely.
- It's absolutely possible.

46:54.612 --> 46:55.582
- It is possible?
- Yes.

46:55.583 --> 46:56.810
- Yeah.
- Yes.

46:56.815 --> 47:00.215
And that's the way traditional
marriages often were.

47:00.218 --> 47:01.918
You simply
put the people together.

47:01.920 --> 47:02.888
They might not love

47:02.889 --> 47:03.717
Each other at first,

47:03.721 --> 47:05.121
They don't know each other.

47:05.123 --> 47:06.093
But they can develop very,

47:06.094 --> 47:08.220
Very deep companionate
love relationships.

47:08.226 --> 47:09.056
So, it's not that the

47:09.060 --> 47:11.228
Passionate love is essential.

47:11.229 --> 47:13.599
But it is one of
the greatest experiences

47:13.600 --> 47:16.567
And for somebody who
craves peak experiences,

47:16.568 --> 47:18.598
And strong emotions,

47:18.603 --> 47:20.903
It is one that I would
not want you to miss.

47:20.905 --> 47:22.405
- But from your point of view,

47:22.407 --> 47:25.167
Miss private and I
could actually have

47:25.176 --> 47:27.176
Developed
a beautiful relationship

47:27.178 --> 47:29.248
Even though it didn't
feel very passionate

47:29.249 --> 47:31.347
- At the beginning.
- Absolutely, absolutely.

47:37.988 --> 47:40.188
- Let's see that last one again.

47:40.191 --> 47:42.791
- It just ends with the plane.

47:43.760 --> 47:46.860
- I'm really trying to
work more on the film

47:46.865 --> 47:50.095
And less on our regular
commercial projects.

47:50.101 --> 47:52.769
- And then you'll
think of some ideas?

47:52.770 --> 47:53.600
- Yes.

47:53.605 --> 47:54.435
- Great.

47:54.439 --> 47:55.369
- Should we set a deadline?

47:55.373 --> 47:57.273
- Otherwise, I'm just
gonna forget.

47:57.275 --> 47:58.265
- Yeah.

47:58.276 --> 47:59.676
- Jessica has great ideas,

47:59.677 --> 48:01.507
Knows how to execute them,

48:01.512 --> 48:03.182
And most important of all,

48:03.183 --> 48:04.611
Has the wherewithal

48:04.616 --> 48:06.146
To make them real.

48:06.150 --> 48:08.120
- Well, we could film,
like, crops.

48:08.121 --> 48:09.719
- Yeah.

48:09.721 --> 48:11.191
Even though she's super young,

48:11.192 --> 48:14.057
She's crazily experienced.

48:14.058 --> 48:17.127
I mean, she designed a website
showing other designers

48:17.128 --> 48:19.728
How to design websites at 13.

48:32.643 --> 48:34.413
I asked her
if she wants to become

48:34.414 --> 48:36.512
A partner in the studio.

48:37.681 --> 48:38.611
She did.

48:38.616 --> 48:40.976
- Pouring like a yellow
paint or something,

48:40.985 --> 48:43.185
And you saw the dripping.

48:45.656 --> 48:48.556
Maybe we start with the plants.

48:48.559 --> 48:51.328
- We renamed the
Studio Sagmeister and Walsh,

48:51.329 --> 48:54.829
And designed a card
announcing that.

48:54.832 --> 48:56.672
We might need
some books for you.

48:56.673 --> 49:01.338
- Okay, and I think
we need about this many.

49:01.339 --> 49:02.769
- Okay.

49:04.074 --> 49:05.574
- Okay, and here we are.

49:05.576 --> 49:09.106
Okay, guys,
and start looking at me.

49:09.113 --> 49:10.280
Look above me.

49:10.281 --> 49:12.281
And you're just
looking at each other

49:12.283 --> 49:13.383
As you're standing there.

49:13.384 --> 49:14.524
Cool, okay, and now

49:14.525 --> 49:16.049
Switch it around.

49:17.254 --> 49:18.922
Great, again, both
looking at me.

49:18.923 --> 49:19.863
Great.

49:20.958 --> 49:22.018
Okay.

49:22.026 --> 49:25.526
- Oh, my god, did you
tan for this, specially?

49:25.530 --> 49:26.460
- Maybe.

- okay.

51:18.875 --> 51:19.805
Okay.

51:23.480 --> 51:25.649
- Well, I felt

51:25.650 --> 51:27.420
It was sort of strange that

51:27.421 --> 51:30.348
We are making
a movie on happiness

51:31.254 --> 51:35.058
And we having a director,
a co-director,

51:35.059 --> 51:37.829
Who is, you know, seriously ill.

51:39.429 --> 51:41.498
How do you feel?

51:41.499 --> 51:42.429
- Just

51:45.068 --> 51:48.698
Having been dealt a set of cards

51:51.007 --> 51:53.277
That are really difficult,

51:54.077 --> 51:56.877
You know, and no breaks.

51:56.881 --> 51:58.781
- In some ways,
I'm actually surprised

51:58.783 --> 52:01.683
That you still
wanna be a part of it.

52:01.686 --> 52:03.946
For all the sort of daily crap

52:03.955 --> 52:08.855
That documentary film
making brings with it.

52:08.860 --> 52:11.460
You know, that you
don't just say, oh, no.

52:11.462 --> 52:13.932
- You know, I mean,
I've got two kids.

52:13.933 --> 52:17.701
I like to see them
watch me work.

52:20.103 --> 52:22.772
It's really gratifying.

52:22.773 --> 52:26.243
They get to see
what their Dad does.

52:28.645 --> 52:29.975
It floats your,

52:38.722 --> 52:40.492
Well-being, I guess.

52:43.894 --> 52:45.494
- There were times

52:48.398 --> 52:50.728
When I'd almost wish it would

52:50.735 --> 52:52.795
Be the other way around.

52:52.803 --> 52:55.003
I mean, are you
angry at all, or?

52:55.006 --> 52:57.736
- I've done the angry thing.

52:57.742 --> 52:58.712
So heavily.

52:59.843 --> 53:00.783
Chairs.

53:01.945 --> 53:02.875
Books.

53:03.847 --> 53:04.907
All kinds of things.

53:04.916 --> 53:06.076
- What, you've thrown chairs?

53:06.083 --> 53:07.083
- Oh, sure.

53:10.120 --> 53:11.190
I did that.

53:12.289 --> 53:14.658
And all it did, really,

53:14.659 --> 53:18.029
Was scare the kids.

53:18.762 --> 53:21.232
Just scared my wife,

53:23.099 --> 53:25.729
And made me feel bad.

53:46.323 --> 53:47.623
- For Hillman, the

53:47.625 --> 53:48.785
Last year of his life

53:48.793 --> 53:50.360
Was not about changing,

53:50.361 --> 53:51.491
But about trying to keep

53:51.495 --> 53:53.925
Everything exactly the same.

53:56.132 --> 54:00.136
He wanted to eat ice cream
with our kids.

54:00.137 --> 54:02.806
He wanted to work on
the happy film.

54:02.807 --> 54:05.367
He wanted to
lie in bed and talk.

54:05.376 --> 54:09.306
And he wanted to have
friends over for dinner.

54:11.181 --> 54:13.821
Why should I accept death,
he'd ask me,

54:13.822 --> 54:16.318
When my life is so beautiful?

55:14.044 --> 55:16.854
- I'm not sad enough.

55:19.482 --> 55:20.422
I'm sad

55:21.484 --> 55:23.594
That I'm not sad enough.

55:29.592 --> 55:33.532
I had a wonderful
conversation with Christina.

55:38.601 --> 55:40.101
She is so honest.

55:41.604 --> 55:42.914
I really can learn from her.

55:42.915 --> 55:46.276
I mean, she really goes deep.

55:46.277 --> 55:48.437
You know, I asked her
how she's doing.

55:48.446 --> 55:50.576
And she said, well,

55:50.581 --> 55:53.016
Tess is just thriving.

55:53.017 --> 55:53.917
Her youngest daughter

55:53.918 --> 55:55.348
Is just thriving

55:56.453 --> 55:58.088
Since Hillman died.

55:58.089 --> 56:00.259
What a difficult thing to admit.

56:03.860 --> 56:05.929
And you notice that it's just,

56:05.930 --> 56:08.860
There was so much sadness
in their house,

56:08.866 --> 56:10.796
That it's so great to

56:10.801 --> 56:12.769
Have that sadness lifted.

56:12.770 --> 56:14.770
And that, if she's, later on,

56:14.772 --> 56:16.212
I'm sure that she's
gonna realize

56:16.213 --> 56:18.837
That she has no Dad.

56:18.843 --> 56:20.283
And there's going to be
difficulties with that.

56:20.284 --> 56:22.877
But right now, she's thriving.

56:23.613 --> 56:25.553
And when I said, well,

56:26.516 --> 56:28.976
Correct me if I'm wrong but,

56:28.986 --> 56:33.286
I would think that Hillman
would be thrilled with that,

56:33.290 --> 56:35.458
She said, oh, was

56:35.459 --> 56:36.329
Not quite sure,

56:36.330 --> 56:37.457
She was sort of quiet, and

56:37.461 --> 56:39.291
I said, well, or not.

56:39.729 --> 56:42.699
There's a darkness in all of us.

56:42.700 --> 56:44.470
And an imperfection.

57:33.917 --> 57:36.617
- It only hits me now.

57:38.087 --> 57:39.117
I miss him.

57:40.790 --> 57:41.890
I really do.

57:55.371 --> 57:57.711
- Given the information
that we've gathered

57:57.712 --> 57:59.738
In terms of your genetics,

57:59.743 --> 58:01.083
I have to say that you're

58:01.084 --> 58:03.546
Probably the healthiest person

58:03.547 --> 58:06.877
That I've seen
all week in my practice.

58:09.052 --> 58:12.492
So let's talk,
then, about anxiety.

58:13.556 --> 58:16.386
- If I would go into a room

58:16.393 --> 58:18.063
Where I don't know anybody,

58:18.064 --> 58:20.296
I can be quite good about that

58:20.297 --> 58:21.557
With a little bit of a going

58:21.565 --> 58:23.825
Over a bump, introduce myself.

58:23.834 --> 58:26.944
Or I can also be
anxious about that.

58:27.904 --> 58:29.914
- And you don't suffer
from being lonely?

58:29.915 --> 58:31.307
- No.

58:31.308 --> 58:32.438
No, I really don't.

58:32.443 --> 58:33.977
And spending time by yourself

58:33.978 --> 58:34.808
Is okay?

58:34.812 --> 58:37.450
- You're okay in your own company?
- Yes.

58:37.451 --> 58:39.078
- So, your anxiety levels then

58:39.083 --> 58:41.951
- I'm a little bit
afraid I'm painting this

58:41.952 --> 58:43.090
Picture a little bit too rosy.

58:43.091 --> 58:44.247
I'm afraid at the end I'm not

58:44.255 --> 58:46.255
Gonna get anything because...

58:46.257 --> 58:47.917
- well,
we'll talk about it though.

58:47.925 --> 58:49.755
I mean, if you were coming to me

58:49.760 --> 58:53.496
And reporting mild
anxiety that you wanted to

58:53.497 --> 58:55.457
Do something about,

58:55.466 --> 58:57.926
I wouldn't be opposed
to prescribing

58:57.935 --> 58:59.795
Something like Lexapro

58:59.803 --> 59:02.503
In a low dose for you,
as a trial.

59:02.506 --> 59:03.866
- Yeah.

59:03.874 --> 59:05.774
- But it has side effects.

59:05.776 --> 59:11.046
- The side effects are dry
mouth, headache, GI upset,

59:13.716 --> 59:15.676
Anxiety, insomnia...

59:15.686 --> 59:18.786
That's not a very good
side effect to have, no?

59:18.789 --> 59:22.219
- These are all possible
side effects.

59:22.226 --> 59:25.126
98% of the people
who take Lexapro

59:25.129 --> 59:28.459
Feel calmer and feel better.

59:28.465 --> 59:31.195
The other thing that happens
when you first start a

59:31.201 --> 59:32.801
Medication like this,

59:32.803 --> 59:35.243
Your brain is going
through some changes.

59:35.244 --> 59:38.207
Actually, your neural circuits
are sort of

59:38.208 --> 59:40.138
Being rearranged.

59:40.144 --> 59:43.146
If everybody knew
how complicated it was

59:43.147 --> 59:44.307
And what these drugs do,

59:44.315 --> 59:46.175
Probably, nobody
would take them.

01:00:15.278 --> 01:00:17.678
- Yeah, this is the second day.

01:00:17.681 --> 01:00:21.521
And I definitely had to

01:00:23.553 --> 01:00:28.323
Schlep myself and force
myself to go running.

01:00:34.631 --> 01:00:38.031
This is four days now
of Lexapro.

01:00:38.534 --> 01:00:40.374
And I definitely feel

01:00:41.904 --> 01:00:43.406
Less energetic.

01:00:43.407 --> 01:00:45.067
I sleep more.

01:00:45.075 --> 01:00:47.675
Today I even had blotchy skin.

01:00:48.544 --> 01:00:51.214
There's actually absolutely

01:00:51.215 --> 01:00:53.415
No betterment whatsoever.

01:00:57.787 --> 01:00:58.917
There might be one thing

01:00:58.922 --> 01:01:01.722
That we could alter slightly,

01:01:01.725 --> 01:01:04.225
Rather than having to abandon

01:01:04.228 --> 01:01:05.928
The experiment completely.

01:01:05.929 --> 01:01:07.159
And that would be to

01:01:07.164 --> 01:01:08.964
Change the medicine

01:01:08.966 --> 01:01:10.296
To a nighttime dose.

01:01:10.300 --> 01:01:11.400
- Oh, excellent.

01:01:11.402 --> 01:01:14.172
Meaning that I get lame
at night and lethargic,

01:01:14.173 --> 01:01:16.571
And have the energy
during the day?

01:01:16.573 --> 01:01:17.411
- Right.

01:01:17.412 --> 01:01:18.338
- Perfect.

01:01:29.787 --> 01:01:34.857
In all my lethargy, one
wonderful thing happened

01:01:34.858 --> 01:01:37.458
Though and it was that

01:01:37.461 --> 01:01:39.701
A very wonderful interviewer
came over

01:01:39.702 --> 01:01:41.497
To set up an interview for

01:01:41.498 --> 01:01:43.866
Some German arty magazine.

01:01:43.867 --> 01:01:44.797
And...

01:01:46.803 --> 01:01:48.938
We just hit it off.

01:01:48.939 --> 01:01:51.409
There was ample time to talk.

01:01:52.642 --> 01:01:54.282
And she seems so positive.

01:01:54.283 --> 01:01:56.446
And so, we just came

01:01:56.447 --> 01:01:58.047
Back onto the roof

01:01:58.948 --> 01:02:00.278
And stayed up

01:02:00.284 --> 01:02:03.052
Until the sun came up.

01:02:03.053 --> 01:02:06.663
And I'll see her
for dinner again tonight.

01:02:13.730 --> 01:02:15.730
Okay, who are you?

01:02:15.733 --> 01:02:16.733
- Who am I?

01:02:21.170 --> 01:02:24.009
- What do you have
to say about happiness?

01:02:24.010 --> 01:02:25.407
- I enjoy being happy.

01:02:25.409 --> 01:02:27.639
How I came about it is
that I definitely realized

01:02:27.644 --> 01:02:30.346
That I'm not so much in control.

01:02:30.347 --> 01:02:32.847
I'm happy to experience it,
you know,

01:02:32.850 --> 01:02:34.550
There might be Moments
where I don't,

01:02:34.551 --> 01:02:36.081
They're not the most

01:02:36.086 --> 01:02:37.386
Desirable Moments,

01:02:37.387 --> 01:02:41.517
But at the Moment,
I'm doing quite well.

01:02:41.525 --> 01:02:44.425
So I would say bring it on.

01:02:44.428 --> 01:02:45.828
- What I loved
about the book was

01:02:45.829 --> 01:02:49.929
That he very clearly states
that in his experience,

01:02:49.933 --> 01:02:52.273
Three things work the best.

01:02:53.669 --> 01:02:57.039
And I am now speaking
to you on drugs.

01:02:58.175 --> 01:03:01.005
I started this regimen
two weeks ago

01:03:01.011 --> 01:03:02.841
And I truly hated it.

01:03:03.613 --> 01:03:07.683
And then four days ago
I met a girl.

01:03:08.851 --> 01:03:11.291
And that changed everything.

01:03:12.522 --> 01:03:16.362
So, when you're in
between drugs and girls,

01:03:17.693 --> 01:03:19.033
No competition.

01:03:20.396 --> 01:03:21.796
No competition.

01:03:24.935 --> 01:03:26.225
My favorite statistics.

01:03:26.236 --> 01:03:28.696
There's one comparing
companionate love

01:03:28.705 --> 01:03:30.535
To passionate love.

01:03:30.541 --> 01:03:35.181
So, clearly,
I am now in the top level.

01:03:38.314 --> 01:03:40.754
But Jonathan says
that in his research,

01:03:40.755 --> 01:03:42.551
This lasts for six months.

01:03:42.553 --> 01:03:44.223
If you look at the whole thing

01:03:44.224 --> 01:03:46.561
From a 60 year perspective,

01:03:48.758 --> 01:03:50.728
The passionate lovers
look pretty silly.

01:03:50.729 --> 01:03:52.457
It looks like
a flash in the pan.

01:03:52.462 --> 01:03:54.232
While the companionate lovers

01:03:54.233 --> 01:03:56.731
Are really the ones that stayed.

01:03:56.733 --> 01:04:03.072
So, if by November, I'm
not so passionate in love

01:04:03.073 --> 01:04:06.443
With the girl
that I met five days ago,

01:04:07.476 --> 01:04:11.076
I don't have to wonder about
it, because it's natural.

01:04:11.081 --> 01:04:12.851
Because if I would have
those kind of Dopamines

01:04:12.852 --> 01:04:15.480
In my body for longer
than six months,

01:04:15.485 --> 01:04:19.815
It would actually be
very unhealthy for me.

01:04:19.823 --> 01:04:20.861
- Like, so many people thought

01:04:20.862 --> 01:04:21.818
That it was a performance,

01:04:21.825 --> 01:04:25.125
That it was not real,
that I made you up

01:04:25.128 --> 01:04:27.597
Basically for the talk.

01:04:27.598 --> 01:04:30.928
- Like the whole thing was kind
of, like, too good to be true.

01:04:30.934 --> 01:04:32.774
- I told you, I was not
lying when I was telling you

01:04:32.775 --> 01:04:35.438
That the pharmaceutical
company hired me.

01:04:35.439 --> 01:04:37.607
It's all business, Hun.

01:04:37.608 --> 01:04:42.278
You know, like, and I will
expire in three months.

01:04:42.279 --> 01:04:45.548
- Well, I can tell you that

01:04:45.549 --> 01:04:47.049
I love big Pharma,

01:04:47.050 --> 01:04:48.650
I love big Pharma.

01:05:05.134 --> 01:05:08.804
- I have to download
a song from nick cave

01:05:08.805 --> 01:05:10.805
Called into my arms.

01:05:10.807 --> 01:05:14.037
And I knew, wow,
it's all so cheesy,

01:05:14.044 --> 01:05:15.814
But that's gonna be our song.

01:05:15.815 --> 01:05:17.512
I just knew.

01:05:17.514 --> 01:05:21.784

01:05:27.690 --> 01:05:32.990

01:06:18.542 --> 01:06:21.412
- I asked Veza yesterday

01:06:22.912 --> 01:06:23.882
If she wants to get married

01:06:23.883 --> 01:06:25.880
To me and she said yes.

01:06:27.383 --> 01:06:29.783
- I love the idea of
committing to each other.

01:06:29.786 --> 01:06:31.716
And being married to oneself

01:06:31.722 --> 01:06:33.892
And being also married to

01:06:35.157 --> 01:06:37.287
A partner who you truly love.

01:06:37.294 --> 01:06:38.394
And I see that in you.

01:06:38.395 --> 01:06:40.125
You're the first man
who definitely

01:06:40.130 --> 01:06:42.398
Sweeps me off the ground.

01:06:42.399 --> 01:06:45.329
And definitely
takes my breath away.

01:06:45.335 --> 01:06:46.265
And, you know, makes my

01:06:46.269 --> 01:06:48.539
Heart go boom, boom, boom.

01:06:49.472 --> 01:06:50.740
Yeah.

01:06:50.741 --> 01:06:53.141
You know, I really love you.

01:06:53.143 --> 01:06:54.243
I really do.

01:06:55.945 --> 01:06:57.245
So, enough now.

01:06:57.247 --> 01:06:58.907
- I love you back.

01:06:58.915 --> 01:07:01.075
- On three.

01:07:01.084 --> 01:07:02.024
One, two.

01:07:05.187 --> 01:07:06.817
- I used to say
that this is so stupid,

01:07:06.823 --> 01:07:09.792
Expecting the girl
to be great in bed,

01:07:09.793 --> 01:07:11.593
Be kind, be intelligent,

01:07:11.595 --> 01:07:13.355
Funny, beautiful.

01:07:13.363 --> 01:07:15.998
The crazy thing
is that she is it.

01:07:15.999 --> 01:07:17.329
I didn't think that
there was somebody

01:07:17.334 --> 01:07:18.934
That perfect out there.

01:07:18.935 --> 01:07:20.635
I've never been
so in love in my life.

01:07:20.637 --> 01:07:21.767
Never.

01:07:21.772 --> 01:07:24.940
I asked her to marry me
and she said yes.

01:07:24.941 --> 01:07:26.441
This is all after 10 days,

01:07:26.443 --> 01:07:28.043
And this is the first woman
in my life

01:07:28.045 --> 01:07:30.675
That I've ever asked
to marry me.

01:07:30.680 --> 01:07:31.780
- Oh, my gosh.

01:07:31.782 --> 01:07:34.682
- So, it's,
suddenly there is that,

01:07:34.684 --> 01:07:36.886
Even though I never expected it.

01:07:36.887 --> 01:07:38.787
Or at least not consciously
expected it.

01:07:38.789 --> 01:07:39.719
I think unconsciously

01:07:39.723 --> 01:07:40.790
Of course I wanted it.

01:07:40.791 --> 01:07:41.621
- Right.

01:07:41.625 --> 01:07:45.355
- And that's just
eerie in a way.

01:07:45.362 --> 01:07:48.562
- Well, I mean, it may or
may not be a coincidence

01:07:48.565 --> 01:07:51.495
That you met the perfect woman

01:07:51.501 --> 01:07:53.969
During this medication trial.

01:07:53.970 --> 01:07:57.139
You, over the last 49 years

01:07:57.140 --> 01:08:01.540
Have been anxious and
sort of tightly wound.

01:08:01.545 --> 01:08:02.535
This is the first time

01:08:02.546 --> 01:08:04.306
You ever tried anything

01:08:04.314 --> 01:08:06.682
That took away that anxiety.

01:08:06.683 --> 01:08:09.083
So maybe it's opened you up.

01:08:09.086 --> 01:08:11.146
I'm much more sharing.

01:08:11.154 --> 01:08:13.424
I talk much more
than I normally would.

01:08:13.425 --> 01:08:16.392
I stopped eating, I lost
15 pounds in the meantime.

01:08:16.393 --> 01:08:19.231
I sleep very little, between
three and five hours a day.

01:08:19.232 --> 01:08:20.658
And I have incredible energy.

01:08:20.663 --> 01:08:22.764
Like, my work
is going fantastic.

01:08:22.765 --> 01:08:24.496
- Are you using more caffeine?

01:08:24.501 --> 01:08:27.741
Yeah, I mean, yesterday I'm
sure I had 15 espressos.

01:08:27.742 --> 01:08:29.197
- 15?

01:08:29.206 --> 01:08:30.636
- Yeah.

01:08:42.518 --> 01:08:44.618
Can I see this on you?

01:08:44.621 --> 01:08:46.821
- Oh, sure.

01:08:51.527 --> 01:08:54.426
- Yeah, smaller one it is.

01:08:54.430 --> 01:08:55.461
Number six.

01:09:04.907 --> 01:09:09.037
- No, I think just
espresso, just as it is.

01:09:09.045 --> 01:09:10.305
- What's this?

01:09:12.314 --> 01:09:14.654
You've gotta be kidding me?

01:09:18.053 --> 01:09:20.393
- Well, let's see.

01:09:21.256 --> 01:09:22.557
- So, it's official now, yeah?

01:09:22.559 --> 01:09:24.328
- Uh huh.
- It's beautiful.

01:09:36.071 --> 01:09:39.441
- I'm having
all of her birthmarks

01:09:39.442 --> 01:09:41.642
Tattooed on my arm.

01:09:41.645 --> 01:09:45.575
And she's having all of
mine tattooed on hers.

01:09:52.254 --> 01:09:53.856
- Okay, can you hear?

01:09:53.857 --> 01:09:55.517
- Can you hear us?
- Are we all ready?

01:09:55.525 --> 01:09:56.755
I can hear us fine too.

01:09:56.760 --> 01:09:58.590
- Yeah, check, check, one, two.

01:09:58.595 --> 01:09:59.755
- Check, yep, we're good.

01:09:59.763 --> 01:10:03.098
How do you feel about
all the filming?

01:10:03.099 --> 01:10:04.199
- Me, personally?

01:10:04.201 --> 01:10:06.268
Very comfortable.

01:10:06.269 --> 01:10:07.839
I think it feels
very natural to me

01:10:07.840 --> 01:10:12.267
Because I really wanna
support Stefan's happiness,

01:10:12.275 --> 01:10:14.675
And of course I wanna
support him in his work.

01:10:14.678 --> 01:10:17.148
And it's been a big
topic for me, happiness.

01:10:17.149 --> 01:10:18.707
- Veza, you said you know

01:10:18.715 --> 01:10:20.475
About these three experiments.

01:10:20.483 --> 01:10:23.121
- So, we've done
two of the experiments.

01:10:23.122 --> 01:10:26.819
- And here we are amidst the third.
- Which I ruined, basically.

01:10:26.823 --> 01:10:28.390
- Tell me about it.

01:10:28.391 --> 01:10:31.691
Fall out of love with you
because the whole thing

01:10:31.695 --> 01:10:33.455
Could be a drug induced...

01:10:33.463 --> 01:10:35.063
- Not at all.

01:10:35.065 --> 01:10:37.725
- But I've only known
you the way I've known you.

01:10:37.734 --> 01:10:40.174
How is it for you guys
to see me with Stefan?

01:10:40.175 --> 01:10:44.039
I think this is actually
interesting to ask you guys.

01:10:44.040 --> 01:10:47.009
- I've never seen Stefan
as happy as he's been.

01:10:47.010 --> 01:10:49.478
Almost recklessly happy.

01:10:49.479 --> 01:10:51.148
- Do you think that's Lexapro?

01:10:51.149 --> 01:10:52.377
- Do I think it's Lexapro?

01:10:52.382 --> 01:10:53.682
This, you're concerned.

01:10:53.683 --> 01:10:54.917
- No, I'm not concerned.

01:10:54.918 --> 01:10:56.818
- I just saw it in your face a little bit.
- - no.

01:10:58.153 --> 01:10:59.253
- I mean, you clearly have

01:10:59.256 --> 01:11:00.416
Doubts about all of this.

01:11:00.423 --> 01:11:02.191
- I'm just trying
to ask the questions

01:11:02.192 --> 01:11:03.192
That I think you would ask

01:11:03.193 --> 01:11:05.433
If you were standing
where I was standing.

01:11:05.434 --> 01:11:08.058
- What would
you think if you heard

01:11:08.064 --> 01:11:10.702
Three months ago
I started taking Lexapro,

01:11:10.703 --> 01:11:12.770
I was terribly depressed
for a week.

01:11:12.771 --> 01:11:15.569
I met a woman,
I fell completely in love,

01:11:15.572 --> 01:11:18.272
And we're going to get married.

01:11:19.675 --> 01:11:21.105
- Oh, crazy.

01:11:21.111 --> 01:11:22.411
Another person, crazy.

01:11:22.412 --> 01:11:23.712
Me, it's different.

01:11:23.713 --> 01:11:27.016
Because I have an
immediate experience of me.

01:11:27.017 --> 01:11:28.847
And I know how it went.

01:11:28.852 --> 01:11:31.086
I've never been so happy.

01:11:31.087 --> 01:11:34.517
I mean, you know, I have
never had in my life,

01:11:34.524 --> 01:11:36.394
Yeah, I probably had
a day that I would say

01:11:36.395 --> 01:11:38.093
That was like a number 10 day,

01:11:38.094 --> 01:11:39.561
Like a 10 out of 10.

01:11:39.562 --> 01:11:43.002
But I've had 10 days
like this in a row.

01:11:46.101 --> 01:11:48.201
- Unbelievable.

01:11:48.204 --> 01:11:49.404
And too good to be true.

01:11:49.406 --> 01:11:50.566
- Yeah, yeah.

01:11:52.574 --> 01:11:56.478
And as we both know, normally,

01:11:56.479 --> 01:11:59.379
In my experience,
every single time,

01:11:59.382 --> 01:12:02.722
Too good to be true
means exactly that.

01:12:04.453 --> 01:12:06.053
- Yeah, I mean,
I think it's fascinating

01:12:06.056 --> 01:12:09.456
How you know about this
concept of romantic love

01:12:09.459 --> 01:12:11.226
And companionate love.

01:12:11.227 --> 01:12:15.497
And it's like you're aware
scientifically of the timeline.

01:12:16.899 --> 01:12:22.469
- The only part of the rider-elephant
duo that knows, is the rider.

01:12:22.472 --> 01:12:24.472
The elephant doesn't
give a shit about this,

01:12:24.474 --> 01:12:25.743
About this knowledge.

01:12:25.744 --> 01:12:27.580
The elephant just does
what he wants.

01:12:27.581 --> 01:12:28.937
The elephant falls in love

01:12:28.945 --> 01:12:33.475
Totally and crazily and

01:12:33.483 --> 01:12:35.250
And just goes in that direction.

01:12:35.251 --> 01:12:37.191
The rider is just sort of
sitting on top of the elephant

01:12:37.192 --> 01:12:38.987
Saying, oh, you know,

01:12:38.988 --> 01:12:40.188
Are you really sure?

01:12:40.190 --> 01:12:41.790
You're on drugs.

01:12:41.791 --> 01:12:44.760
And the elephant just goes.

01:12:44.761 --> 01:12:46.091
- Yeah.

01:14:05.340 --> 01:14:07.380
- So, baby, we
had a fight today, no?

01:14:07.381 --> 01:14:09.207
In the morning or,

01:14:09.212 --> 01:14:11.212
Yeah, I think you can
call it a fight.

01:14:11.214 --> 01:14:12.054
What do you think?

01:14:12.055 --> 01:14:13.778
- I don't think it was a fight.

01:14:13.783 --> 01:14:15.683
You should see me fight.

01:14:15.685 --> 01:14:16.875
- Yeah?

01:14:16.886 --> 01:14:20.086
- No

01:14:20.089 --> 01:14:21.289
Yeah, we did.

01:14:23.692 --> 01:14:28.230
And look at we are still here.

01:14:28.231 --> 01:14:31.501
- I'm about a week off drugs.

01:14:33.368 --> 01:14:36.368
And right now
I'm not doing well.

01:14:36.372 --> 01:14:38.542
- Let's hear
what's been going on.

01:14:38.543 --> 01:14:41.109
- It's been not great,
I have to say.

01:14:41.110 --> 01:14:42.580
In general, when it's not been,

01:14:42.581 --> 01:14:43.979
The outer circumstances

01:14:43.980 --> 01:14:45.910
Haven't been that fantastic,

01:14:45.915 --> 01:14:48.715
I surely haven't been
fantastic either.

01:14:48.718 --> 01:14:52.048
- I'm not sure that the Lexapro

01:14:52.055 --> 01:14:53.315
In your system

01:14:54.456 --> 01:14:59.156
Was really the true you.

01:14:59.162 --> 01:15:01.562
What's going on in terms
of the relationship?

01:15:01.564 --> 01:15:04.004
- Not as ecstatic as it was.

01:15:04.967 --> 01:15:06.727
- Well, maybe it's normalizing.

01:15:06.736 --> 01:15:07.966
- Yeah, yeah.

01:15:07.971 --> 01:15:13.509
Level of passion can
continue over the long run.

01:15:13.510 --> 01:15:16.240
- I mean, that's basically
what I had expected.

01:15:16.246 --> 01:15:18.176
Yeah, I don't think that it can.

01:15:18.181 --> 01:15:19.411
- Whenever you make
one of these changes,

01:15:19.415 --> 01:15:21.015
You wanna give it a few months.

01:15:21.017 --> 01:15:22.917
Don't be bouncing around with

01:15:22.919 --> 01:15:24.088
Just four or five weeks off.

01:15:24.089 --> 01:15:26.917
You know, let your brain
and body get back

01:15:26.923 --> 01:15:28.761
To whatever level it's gonna be

01:15:28.762 --> 01:15:30.418
For at least a couple of months.

01:15:30.426 --> 01:15:32.426
And whatever you do,

01:15:32.428 --> 01:15:35.197
Don't break up with Veza
in the next few weeks.

01:15:35.198 --> 01:15:36.858
Give it a couple of months.

01:15:36.866 --> 01:15:38.796
Get back to your baseline

01:15:38.801 --> 01:15:39.971
And see how things are.

01:15:39.972 --> 01:15:41.369
- Yeah.

01:15:44.640 --> 01:15:45.640
I thank you very, very much

01:15:45.642 --> 01:15:47.172
For coming and for listening.

01:15:47.176 --> 01:15:48.606
What you see here,

01:15:48.611 --> 01:15:50.946
They are part of a whole series

01:15:50.947 --> 01:15:56.317
Of maxims that
I always felt was helpful

01:15:56.319 --> 01:15:58.149
To at least know of

01:15:58.154 --> 01:15:59.324
What I actually have learned

01:15:59.325 --> 01:16:00.856
In my life so far.

01:16:00.857 --> 01:16:04.357
This piece itself, the way
that it works is basically,

01:16:04.360 --> 01:16:05.990
You look through the frame

01:16:05.995 --> 01:16:07.455
And there is a smile detection

01:16:07.463 --> 01:16:09.298
Software here somewhere.

01:16:09.299 --> 01:16:11.229
So if I smile properly

01:16:13.635 --> 01:16:14.465
Yeah,

01:16:14.470 --> 01:16:16.570
It actually does reward me

01:16:16.573 --> 01:16:18.443
By becoming colorful.

01:16:19.741 --> 01:16:20.641
And this is a sentence that

01:16:20.643 --> 01:16:22.711
Came out of cognitive therapy.

01:16:22.712 --> 01:16:25.681
The step up to it,
basically, my therapist saw

01:16:25.682 --> 01:16:29.952
That I'm not quite ready
enough for confrontation.

01:16:38.093 --> 01:16:39.363
The elevators.

01:16:41.496 --> 01:16:43.996
And then a freight elevator

01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:46.330
That opened up differently.

01:16:59.681 --> 01:17:03.951
Press the button and it
tells you what to do next.

01:17:31.313 --> 01:17:33.113
Look, I'll show you
my favorite ones here.

01:17:33.116 --> 01:17:35.376
See the curve?

01:17:35.385 --> 01:17:36.215
- Yes.

01:17:36.219 --> 01:17:37.079
- Most people feel

01:17:37.086 --> 01:17:38.716
Like a seven or an eight.

01:17:38.721 --> 01:17:39.651
Want one?

01:17:45.761 --> 01:17:47.701
Put a quarter in here.

01:17:48.930 --> 01:17:50.560
It rolls outside.

01:17:50.566 --> 01:17:53.896
Anybody can take it in
front of the museum.

01:17:53.903 --> 01:17:54.970
And this one.

01:17:54.971 --> 01:17:56.071
Companionate love,

01:17:56.072 --> 01:17:57.606
Passionate love.

01:17:57.607 --> 01:17:59.707
And you have six months.

01:18:01.243 --> 01:18:03.779
So, passionate love
does go down.

01:18:03.780 --> 01:18:04.950
And companionate love has

01:18:04.951 --> 01:18:06.607
A possibility to grow.

01:18:06.616 --> 01:18:07.916
So we'll have to transform

01:18:07.917 --> 01:18:10.077
It into companionate love.

01:18:10.086 --> 01:18:11.586
- No, but I already...
- but keeping some of the passion.

01:18:11.587 --> 01:18:13.947
- But I already feel
companionate love with you,

01:18:13.956 --> 01:18:16.186
From the beginning.

01:18:18.293 --> 01:18:21.533
- This is what I have to expect with you?
- Mm-hm.

01:18:21.534 --> 01:18:23.131
- Yeah?
- Mm-hm.

01:18:25.200 --> 01:18:26.968
- I think so.

01:18:26.969 --> 01:18:29.469
I mean, I haven't been there.

01:18:30.338 --> 01:18:32.138
No, but in the past,
it's sort of like it was

01:18:32.141 --> 01:18:33.641
My pattern, you know?

01:18:33.643 --> 01:18:35.313
- Roughly.
- Well, then break it.

01:18:35.314 --> 01:18:37.946
- I don't think
it's breakable, baby.

01:18:37.947 --> 01:18:39.307
I think it's human.

01:18:39.315 --> 01:18:40.405
- No.

01:18:43.151 --> 01:18:45.287
- And I don't have expectations

01:18:45.288 --> 01:18:49.918
That it's gonna go on in that
sort of passionate level forever.

01:18:51.226 --> 01:18:54.296
And I think that that's good.

01:18:54.297 --> 01:18:55.157
- You know what the difference

01:18:55.164 --> 01:18:56.034
Between me and you is?

01:18:56.035 --> 01:18:57.632
I don't even think about it.

01:18:57.633 --> 01:18:58.473
I'm here now.

01:18:58.474 --> 01:18:59.498
That's the difference.

01:18:59.502 --> 01:19:00.802
- And I, of course,
have to think about it

01:19:00.803 --> 01:19:02.973
Because, you know,
I did all that.

01:19:02.974 --> 01:19:04.472
You know, I've been dealing

01:19:04.474 --> 01:19:06.842
With all this research for...

01:19:06.843 --> 01:19:09.143
- I know.
- A long time now.

01:19:09.145 --> 01:19:11.805
In general,
a problem with relationships

01:19:11.814 --> 01:19:14.549
Is that the expectations
are too high.

01:19:14.550 --> 01:19:16.320
Or that one of the reasons
why my parents

01:19:16.321 --> 01:19:18.519
Had such
a great marriage, I think,

01:19:18.521 --> 01:19:20.351
Is because they didn't really

01:19:20.356 --> 01:19:22.556
Have a lot of expectations.

01:19:22.558 --> 01:19:24.988
They didn't know each
other very well and...

01:19:24.994 --> 01:19:27.834
- No, I see that,
no, I see that.

01:19:29.831 --> 01:19:31.366
- Good.

01:19:31.367 --> 01:19:33.267
Let's leave it there.

01:19:36.538 --> 01:19:37.938
I'm like afraid

01:19:38.707 --> 01:19:40.977
To provoke more arguments.

01:20:37.465 --> 01:20:40.595
- Welcome to
the sacred ceremony.

01:20:40.603 --> 01:20:42.571
To this beautiful opportunity

01:20:42.572 --> 01:20:46.572
To leave our old self behind.

01:20:46.576 --> 01:20:50.676
Your life will be
in line with nature.

01:20:53.114 --> 01:20:57.384
- Veza's model
friend suggested Ayahuasca.

01:20:58.253 --> 01:21:01.523
I agreed
and we tried it out together.

01:21:07.429 --> 01:21:08.529
- Your eyes.

01:21:09.431 --> 01:21:11.199
It made no difference.

01:21:11.200 --> 01:21:13.969
Every month we had a fight

01:21:13.970 --> 01:21:18.270
That went all the way
to the edge, basically,

01:21:18.274 --> 01:21:19.874
Where we broke up.

01:21:23.178 --> 01:21:24.608
- I feel like, okay, whoa,

01:21:24.614 --> 01:21:28.624
What did I do that you're
so irritated with me?

01:21:30.619 --> 01:21:32.449
Well, I'm just saying
I want you to be happy

01:21:32.455 --> 01:21:34.315
With what we do and whatnot.

01:21:34.323 --> 01:21:36.163
- Oh, yeah, no, no,
absolutely, yeah.

01:21:36.164 --> 01:21:37.558
- Good to know.

01:21:44.900 --> 01:21:46.370
- It's a little bit like,

01:21:46.371 --> 01:21:48.199
And I'm really scared in a way

01:21:48.204 --> 01:21:51.640
That this will turn you off.

01:21:51.641 --> 01:21:53.241
Because, you know,

01:21:54.376 --> 01:21:56.406
I mean, simply, if you
don't get along with me,

01:21:56.412 --> 01:22:00.512
Then why would you wanna
stay with me, you know?

01:22:05.153 --> 01:22:07.989
- I think I said that wrong.

01:22:07.990 --> 01:22:11.660
That I don't think that
we don't get along.

01:22:53.368 --> 01:22:56.538
Another big fight today.

01:22:56.539 --> 01:22:57.869
In the morning.

01:22:59.374 --> 01:23:01.776
Very close to the edge.

01:23:01.777 --> 01:23:05.347
And Veza asked me afterwards

01:23:07.415 --> 01:23:10.245
If I still wanted
to get married.

01:23:11.386 --> 01:23:15.556
And I didn't really know
what else to do,

01:23:15.558 --> 01:23:18.528
So I made another
pro and con list.

01:23:21.229 --> 01:23:22.659
Getting married.

01:23:23.898 --> 01:23:25.398
Pro, four points.

01:23:27.068 --> 01:23:28.998
Against, seven points.

01:23:35.777 --> 01:23:38.707
- Such a crazy thing
that we were.

01:23:40.415 --> 01:23:45.085
Such a fantastic
falling in love couple.

01:23:45.087 --> 01:23:46.817
I mean, I've never

01:23:46.822 --> 01:23:50.322
Fallen so hard

01:23:50.326 --> 01:23:53.626
And so deeply in love.

01:23:55.597 --> 01:23:58.697
And we are not a

01:23:59.100 --> 01:24:01.300
Companionate love couple.

01:24:13.281 --> 01:24:14.451
You know, here you are.

01:24:14.452 --> 01:24:16.820
You set off
to do this science experiment.

01:24:16.821 --> 01:24:20.719
In my office two years ago, three
years ago, whatever it was,

01:24:20.723 --> 01:24:21.893
When we were talking about this

01:24:21.894 --> 01:24:23.791
What was clear
was that your weaknesses

01:24:23.793 --> 01:24:26.361
Were about
interpersonal connection

01:24:26.362 --> 01:24:28.231
And commitment and gratitude.

01:24:28.232 --> 01:24:29.560
And I think I even said,

01:24:29.565 --> 01:24:30.995
You can go back
and look at the footage,

01:24:31.000 --> 01:24:33.130
I think I even said
something like,

01:24:33.135 --> 01:24:34.165
Well, it would
be interesting to see

01:24:34.170 --> 01:24:35.239
If you fall in love during

01:24:35.240 --> 01:24:38.167
- yeah.
- Because this is where your weakness is.

01:24:38.174 --> 01:24:39.744
And so, you did fall in love.

01:24:39.745 --> 01:24:40.972
Three times.

01:24:40.976 --> 01:24:43.576
And you go off and
you're doing meditation,

01:24:43.579 --> 01:24:46.679
And bang, this...
a relationship,

01:24:46.682 --> 01:24:49.682
Which blows out of the
water any possibility

01:24:49.685 --> 01:24:51.885
To measure whether, okay,

01:24:51.887 --> 01:24:53.647
That's a little bit funny.

01:24:53.656 --> 01:24:55.416
And then you go and you
do cognitive therapy,

01:24:55.424 --> 01:24:57.058
And the same thing happens.

01:24:57.059 --> 01:24:57.889
- Yeah.

01:24:57.893 --> 01:24:58.733
- Now it gets funnier.

01:24:58.734 --> 01:24:59.987
And a joke always has,

01:24:59.995 --> 01:25:01.525
You know, three sections.

01:25:01.530 --> 01:25:05.200
So the fact that
it happens three times,

01:25:05.201 --> 01:25:09.337
Stefan, this should
be a movie about

01:25:09.338 --> 01:25:12.838
You and your weaknesses,

01:25:12.842 --> 01:25:15.442
And your attempts to fix them.

01:25:18.880 --> 01:25:21.520
- Oh fuck, this is
gonna be such a nightmare

01:25:21.521 --> 01:25:23.647
To figure this movie out.

01:25:26.187 --> 01:25:30.157
I started out to get some
really clear answers.

01:25:32.293 --> 01:25:33.628
And what I got back

01:25:33.629 --> 01:25:36.229
Is a bunch of mush.

01:25:37.599 --> 01:25:38.399
What have you learned

01:25:38.400 --> 01:25:40.130
About the causes of happiness?

01:25:40.136 --> 01:25:41.366
Do you have
a better understanding

01:25:41.370 --> 01:25:43.470
Of what makes you happy?

01:25:45.640 --> 01:25:47.240
- I didn't wanna make a film

01:25:47.243 --> 01:25:49.210
About questions.

01:25:49.211 --> 01:25:50.311
And I hate all this stuff.

01:25:50.312 --> 01:25:51.982
Oh, it's not about the answers.

01:25:51.983 --> 01:25:54.449
It's about the right questions.

01:25:54.450 --> 01:25:55.980
Blah, blah, blah.

01:26:02.490 --> 01:26:03.420
Fuck.

01:26:05.927 --> 01:26:08.097
This is a total disaster.

01:26:12.133 --> 01:26:13.768

01:26:13.769 --> 01:26:15.999

- Trying to look good

01:26:32.291 --> 01:26:33.688
Limits my life.

01:26:34.856 --> 01:26:37.816
I know, but I'm getting
getting very concerned

01:26:37.826 --> 01:26:40.426
About how I look in this film.

01:26:43.464 --> 01:26:44.704
I'm a 50 year old guy who dates

01:26:44.705 --> 01:26:46.730
Women 20 years younger.

01:26:48.102 --> 01:26:49.942
And calls them girls.

01:26:51.806 --> 01:26:54.836
I just spent the past
six years of my life

01:26:54.843 --> 01:26:57.043
Working on this thing

01:26:57.046 --> 01:26:59.906
That says I'm an asshole.

01:27:00.848 --> 01:27:04.278
What a great use of my time.

01:27:07.488 --> 01:27:11.758
I should have stuck to
chairs made out of letters.

01:27:15.964 --> 01:27:18.134
- So, you
chose the three techniques

01:27:18.135 --> 01:27:21.236
That I describe in chapter two
of the book

01:27:21.237 --> 01:27:23.037
For changing the elephant.

01:27:23.038 --> 01:27:25.308
But your problem
wasn't the elephant.

01:27:25.309 --> 01:27:27.467
You could just as well
have chosen

01:27:27.476 --> 01:27:30.476
The three aspects of between.

01:27:30.479 --> 01:27:34.309
So, what if you had worked
on your relationships?

01:27:34.316 --> 01:27:35.676
And worked on the satisfaction

01:27:35.684 --> 01:27:37.218
You get from work?

01:27:37.219 --> 01:27:40.188
And tried to get involved

01:27:40.189 --> 01:27:42.589
With some sort of larger project

01:27:42.591 --> 01:27:45.930
In the company of people that
you really like and respect?

01:27:45.931 --> 01:27:48.858
That would be changing the
conditions of your life

01:27:48.864 --> 01:27:52.000
In ways that, I would predict,

01:27:52.001 --> 01:27:53.701
Happiness would then follow

01:27:53.702 --> 01:27:56.142
As you got a better between.

01:27:59.040 --> 01:28:01.240
- Well, in a way,

01:28:01.243 --> 01:28:04.283
That has been
what I've been doing.

01:28:05.380 --> 01:28:08.116
I mean, I definitely

01:28:08.117 --> 01:28:10.547
Worked on my relationships.

01:28:10.552 --> 01:28:13.722
Not all that successfully,
but I did.

01:28:15.857 --> 01:28:19.587
And I have been more
satisfied with my work.

01:28:19.595 --> 01:28:22.195
The happy show
was a big success.

01:28:22.197 --> 01:28:26.727
I mean, almost a 1/4 of
a million came to see it.

01:28:26.735 --> 01:28:29.135
And this whole film project

01:28:29.871 --> 01:28:33.211
Surely feels larger than me.

01:28:34.075 --> 01:28:37.875
Basically outside of my control.

01:28:38.413 --> 01:28:43.423
Like I'm the rider
and it's the elephant.

01:28:48.423 --> 01:28:54.093
This film started as a graphic
design project six years ago.

01:28:54.096 --> 01:28:58.196
And somehow
it all became about me.

01:29:00.268 --> 01:29:02.637
I guess I could have
continued designing stuff

01:29:02.638 --> 01:29:05.068
That I know how to do.

01:29:05.074 --> 01:29:06.114
It would have been

01:29:06.115 --> 01:29:08.108
So much easier.

01:29:08.110 --> 01:29:12.110
Trying to chase after
something more meaningful

01:29:13.147 --> 01:29:16.517
Turned out to be
a big pain in the ass.

01:29:18.753 --> 01:29:19.953
But it also did

01:29:19.955 --> 01:29:21.915
Make my life fuller.

01:29:35.603 --> 01:29:37.839
- So what's the purpose,

01:29:37.840 --> 01:29:39.870
Why am I actually here?

01:29:43.544 --> 01:29:46.180
I guess it would be
to do something

01:29:46.181 --> 01:29:49.717
That either delights

01:29:49.718 --> 01:29:51.648
Or helps other people.

01:29:52.653 --> 01:29:55.022
Or simply finding something

01:29:55.023 --> 01:29:57.123
That's bigger than myself,

01:29:57.126 --> 01:29:59.386
And dedicate myself to it.

01:30:03.131 --> 01:30:06.231
I'm still blowing air
into balloons.

01:30:11.472 --> 01:30:13.641
Trusting, somehow, into

01:30:13.642 --> 01:30:15.742
The lightness of things.

01:30:16.811 --> 01:30:18.811
Believing it will work.

01:30:28.256 --> 01:30:29.986
There's a shitload

01:30:29.992 --> 01:30:31.492
Of possibilities.

01:30:34.996 --> 01:30:39.166
One day it will be me up there.

01:30:44.072 --> 01:30:45.112
I will fly.

01:30:48.443 --> 01:30:50.213
