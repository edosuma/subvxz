WEBVTT

00:03.410 --> 00:06.384
I've invented a science joke,
would you like to hear it?

00:06.385 --> 00:07.564
Sure.

00:07.564 --> 00:11.166
How many Edisons does it take
to screw in a light bulb?

00:11.168 --> 00:12.835
How many?

00:12.837 --> 00:14.837
Who cares?
He stole the idea

00:14.839 --> 00:17.172
and doesn't deserve
his own joke.

00:17.174 --> 00:18.741
Is that really true?

00:18.743 --> 00:21.410
Of course, that's how you know
it's a good joke.

00:21.412 --> 00:24.046
It not only entertains,
it informs.

00:25.515 --> 00:27.082
Hey, sorry
to interrupt.

00:27.084 --> 00:28.417
Uh, Barry,

00:28.419 --> 00:31.620
uh, how many Edisons does it
take to screw in a light bulb?

00:31.622 --> 00:34.022
Did you know Edison didn't
actually invent the light bulb?

00:37.260 --> 00:39.595
What do you want,
Barry?

00:39.597 --> 00:42.598
Just wanted to drop this off
as a little thank you for Amy.

00:42.600 --> 00:43.932
What's this for?

00:43.934 --> 00:45.734
Your idea really
helped me out.

00:45.736 --> 00:48.370
My light-cone quantization
paper's online already.

00:48.372 --> 00:50.873
The response
has been amazing.

00:50.875 --> 00:52.307
Well, that's
fascinating.

00:52.309 --> 00:53.776
I can't wait to read it.

00:53.778 --> 00:55.110
Oh, no, me as well.

00:55.112 --> 00:59.214
Uh, please e-mail it
to Sheldon@Bazinga.biz.

00:59.216 --> 01:00.549
Why "dot-biz"?

01:00.551 --> 01:02.084
Because I just gave
you the business.

01:03.253 --> 01:05.254
And also Bazinga.com
was taken.

01:06.923 --> 01:08.924
Anyway, thanks again.

01:08.926 --> 01:10.592
Cooper, suck eggs.

01:13.096 --> 01:15.330
Since when do you help out
Barry Kripke?

01:15.332 --> 01:17.833
Well, I'd been thinking about
a cellular automata approach

01:17.835 --> 01:19.334
to neuronal connectivity,

01:19.336 --> 01:21.170
and I thought it might have
some interesting applications

01:21.172 --> 01:22.738
to string theory--
it's not a big deal.

01:22.740 --> 01:24.640
Oh, really?

01:24.642 --> 01:27.309
When I was doing string theory
and hit a dead end,

01:27.311 --> 01:29.077
why didn't you try to help me?

01:29.079 --> 01:32.080
I did-- you said the only
math biologists know is

01:32.082 --> 01:34.249
if you have three frogs
and one hops away,

01:34.251 --> 01:36.485
that leaves two frogs.

01:36.487 --> 01:39.755
That's pretty funny,
that does sound like me.

01:39.757 --> 01:40.923
But that doesn't mean

01:40.925 --> 01:42.891
that you should be
standing on street corners

01:42.893 --> 01:46.128
handing out your math
to whatever guy comes along.

01:47.497 --> 01:49.164
Sheldon, we're all scientists.

01:49.166 --> 01:50.833
I helped out
a fellow colleague.

01:50.835 --> 01:52.167
You're being petty.

01:52.169 --> 01:53.769
I'm being petty?

01:53.771 --> 01:57.105
You know Barry and I
have a professional rivalry.

01:57.107 --> 01:59.208
You heard him--
he told me to suck eggs.

01:59.210 --> 02:01.210
If we were friends,
he would have suggested

02:01.212 --> 02:02.611
I suck something
more pleasant.

02:05.782 --> 02:07.482
Why are you laughing?

02:07.484 --> 02:08.984

02:39.621 --> 02:40.955
Okay, Ma.

02:40.957 --> 02:42.623
Say hi to Aunt Gladys.

02:42.625 --> 02:43.891
Yeah, I love you,
too.

02:43.893 --> 02:44.893
Bye.

02:44.894 --> 02:46.727
Your mom having fun in Florida?

02:46.729 --> 02:48.062
Mmm, she loves it.

02:48.064 --> 02:50.064
She finally found a place
where everyone talks about

02:50.066 --> 02:51.465
how sweaty they are.

02:52.501 --> 02:54.502
Anyway, she wants us
to go to the house

02:54.504 --> 02:57.605
and check in on Stuart
because he might be "lonely."

02:57.607 --> 02:59.273
She's just being nice.

02:59.275 --> 03:01.509
Well, I'm her son, how come
she doesn't send someone

03:01.511 --> 03:03.177
to check on me if I'm lonely?

03:03.179 --> 03:05.179
Because you have a wife.

03:08.250 --> 03:11.318
Yeah, well, sometimes
you work late.

03:11.320 --> 03:14.288
I know you don't like
Stuart being in the house,

03:14.290 --> 03:15.790
but the store's
about to reopen,

03:15.792 --> 03:17.158
I'm sure he'll get
back on his feet.

03:17.160 --> 03:18.693
That would be great.

03:18.695 --> 03:21.095
I'd love for things between me
and Mom to get back to normal.

03:21.097 --> 03:24.732
Well, normal's a
strong word, but sure.

03:28.937 --> 03:31.338
Hey.
Hello.

03:31.340 --> 03:32.873
You okay?

03:32.875 --> 03:35.209
If I was okay,
I would've said "hello"

03:35.211 --> 03:36.944
and not the much more
ominous "hello."

03:38.647 --> 03:39.647
What's going on?

03:39.649 --> 03:41.115
I'm mad at Amy.

03:41.117 --> 03:45.052
Did she leave pit stains
in your favorite crop top, too?

03:45.054 --> 03:47.722
No.

03:47.724 --> 03:51.225
She helped Barry Kripke make
an advancement in string theory.

03:51.227 --> 03:53.360
Oh, that sounds
like a good thing.

03:53.362 --> 03:56.230
Well, it would be,
except that I left string theory

03:56.232 --> 03:58.165
because I decided
it was a dead end.

03:58.167 --> 04:00.334
Yeah, and then she went
behind my back

04:00.336 --> 04:02.203
to help someone else
prove me wrong.

04:02.205 --> 04:03.804
My rival, no less.

04:05.000 --> 04:11.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:15.417 --> 04:17.718
I'm sorry you had to see that.

04:17.720 --> 04:21.088
I'm sorry I didn't have
a camera.

04:21.089 --> 04:23.090
Why would she
do this to me?

04:23.092 --> 04:25.760
Well, I'm sure she didn't
upset you on purpose.

04:25.762 --> 04:27.261
Besides, aren't you
the one who says

04:27.263 --> 04:29.864
there's nothing more important
than the advancement of science?

04:29.866 --> 04:32.366
No, I said there's
nothing more important

04:32.368 --> 04:34.702
than <i>me</i> advancing science.

04:34.704 --> 04:36.670
All right, well, if I'm
understanding this right,

04:36.672 --> 04:39.006
and all she did was help
out another scientist,

04:39.008 --> 04:41.675
I'm thinking you might
have to let this one go.

04:41.677 --> 04:43.677
Ugh, "let it go."

04:43.679 --> 04:46.046
I have heard that
my whole life.

04:46.048 --> 04:48.215
Every time something upsets me
somebody says, "let it go,"

04:48.217 --> 04:49.717
you know,
like it's my fault,

04:49.719 --> 04:51.719
and it's not okay
to feel the way I feel.

04:51.721 --> 04:53.120
I don't know
what to tell you.

04:53.122 --> 04:54.555
I mean, why don't
you talk to her?

04:54.557 --> 04:56.557
Is that all you have?

04:56.559 --> 04:59.493
Shopworn tidbits like
"talk to her" and "let it go"?

04:59.495 --> 05:01.362
Gee, Penny,
life's giving me lemons.

05:01.364 --> 05:02.696
What should I do?

05:02.698 --> 05:05.032
Well, you could shove
them somewhere.

05:07.402 --> 05:09.737
Okay, now you're
getting creative.

05:11.106 --> 05:12.773
Thanks again
for your help.

05:12.775 --> 05:14.108
No problem.
Our pleasure.

05:14.110 --> 05:15.576
The place really
looks great.

05:15.578 --> 05:18.045
Yeah, you should have
burned it down years ago.

05:18.047 --> 05:21.415
I keep telling you
I didn't burn it down.

05:21.417 --> 05:23.083
We know, we know--
because burning something down

05:23.085 --> 05:25.920
for the insurance money
is a "crime."

05:27.088 --> 05:30.157
Stuart, this place
looks amazing.

05:30.159 --> 05:31.125
Thanks.

05:31.127 --> 05:33.394
You really did
a nice job.

05:33.396 --> 05:35.729
And thank you
for putting up with me

05:35.731 --> 05:37.398
staying at your mom's
through all this.

05:37.400 --> 05:39.400
I-I couldn't have done it
otherwise.

05:39.402 --> 05:42.403
I appreciate that,
and I'm glad you were able to...

05:44.272 --> 05:45.606
Is that my mother's furniture?

05:48.944 --> 05:50.244
Yeah, she said
I could use it.

05:50.246 --> 05:51.612
Doesn't it look
great?

05:51.614 --> 05:54.748
Not as great as it looks in
the den where it belongs.

05:54.750 --> 05:56.450
Howie.

05:56.452 --> 05:59.553
Why don't you just clean out
the whole room?

05:59.555 --> 06:01.889
Take the string art clown
I made her in third grade

06:01.891 --> 06:03.490
and the ribbon I got
in swim class

06:03.492 --> 06:04.925
for putting my face
in the water.

06:04.927 --> 06:06.260
What is your problem?

06:06.262 --> 06:07.595
She said it was okay.

06:07.597 --> 06:10.197
Well, I'm her son,
and I say it's not okay.

06:10.199 --> 06:13.567
Some son-- looks like you spent
ten minutes on that clown art.

06:15.503 --> 06:17.972
Well, maybe I should've gone
to a fancy art school like you.

06:17.974 --> 06:19.607
Then I could run
a failed comic shop

06:19.609 --> 06:20.908
and mooch off
some guy's mother.

06:22.277 --> 06:23.844
Why don't we leave
so you can cool off?

06:23.846 --> 06:25.846
I think that's
a good idea.

06:25.848 --> 06:27.114
Take him out
of my store.

06:27.116 --> 06:28.215
Your store?!

06:28.217 --> 06:30.217
My mother gave you
the money to reopen.

06:30.219 --> 06:31.819
I'm not going anywhere.

06:31.821 --> 06:33.520
Why don't we go get
the food for the party.

06:33.522 --> 06:34.622
Thank you.

06:34.624 --> 06:36.624
Smart-- looks like
we're being helpful.

06:36.626 --> 06:38.292
Mmm, when really
we're just exiting

06:38.294 --> 06:39.960
an uncomfortable
situation.

06:43.064 --> 06:45.866
Kripke, you know, of all
the people-- Barry Kripke.

06:45.868 --> 06:48.035
I'm so... Are you folding
it like a crazy person

06:48.037 --> 06:49.703
to get me to
do it for you?!

06:50.839 --> 06:52.006
No.

06:54.542 --> 06:55.876
Oh, give me that.

07:01.483 --> 07:03.817
Just out of curiosity,

07:03.819 --> 07:06.487
if I were to let something go,

07:06.489 --> 07:07.888
how would I do that?

07:07.890 --> 07:10.858
I don't know-- just think
about something else.

07:12.327 --> 07:14.328
Can I think
about the spiny anteater?

07:14.330 --> 07:15.496
Sure.

07:15.498 --> 07:18.165
The spiny anteater...

07:18.167 --> 07:21.168
never went behind my back
and worked with Barry Kripke.

07:22.871 --> 07:25.539
That didn't help at all.

07:25.541 --> 07:28.509
You know, some people
try visualization.

07:28.511 --> 07:30.010
How does that work?

07:32.047 --> 07:33.847
Okay,

07:33.849 --> 07:36.884
imagine your problems
are a pen.

07:38.219 --> 07:39.753
Okay.

07:39.755 --> 07:42.323
Now imagine
you're holding that pen.

07:46.962 --> 07:48.963
Okay.

07:48.965 --> 07:52.199
Now open your hand
and let it go.

07:52.201 --> 07:54.268
But I just got this pen.

07:55.637 --> 07:58.238
It's got my initials on it
and everything.

07:58.240 --> 07:59.907
Look.

08:01.710 --> 08:04.445
Sheldon, this isn't
that hard.

08:06.815 --> 08:09.283
I may have a better way
that you can teach me.

08:09.285 --> 08:10.718
How?

08:10.720 --> 08:14.388
What if I told you
that over the past few months

08:14.390 --> 08:17.391
Amy has secretly been giving you
little puzzles

08:17.393 --> 08:20.394
to test your intelligence
against chimpanzees in her lab?

08:22.597 --> 08:24.098
What? She didn't
give me any puzzles.

08:24.100 --> 08:26.233
Are you sure?

08:29.137 --> 08:32.573
Boy, I just can't seem to get
these scissors back together.

08:32.575 --> 08:34.375
Can you do it?

08:35.844 --> 08:37.177
Darn it.

08:37.179 --> 08:38.578
There's something
in my eye,

08:38.581 --> 08:42.249
and I need to sort
these coins by size.

08:42.251 --> 08:43.583
Can you help?

08:48.757 --> 08:51.025
Penny?

08:51.027 --> 08:53.027
I really want to
eat this banana,

08:53.029 --> 08:56.030
but it's stuck inside
this bamboo puzzle box.

08:59.100 --> 09:02.169
Son of a bitch!

09:02.171 --> 09:03.570
Okay, that's great.

09:03.572 --> 09:05.406
Now, let it go.

09:14.649 --> 09:17.718
I can't believe you were
testing me against a chimp!

09:17.720 --> 09:20.387
Well, excuse me,
Amy was testing you.

09:20.389 --> 09:22.656
I was rooting for you.

09:23.992 --> 09:27.227
Good job on that banana box,
by the way.

09:27.229 --> 09:29.997
Why would she
even do this?

09:29.999 --> 09:31.999
She's been conducting
an experiment on apes

09:32.001 --> 09:33.901
where they're given
various puzzles to solve.

09:33.903 --> 09:36.570
I was surprised
at the complexity of the puzzles

09:36.572 --> 09:38.906
and thought some humans wouldn't
be able to solve them.

09:38.908 --> 09:42.276
That's when Amy said,
"Want to make this interesting?"

09:43.311 --> 09:44.812
"Make this interesting"?

09:44.814 --> 09:46.413
You bet money on me?

09:46.415 --> 09:47.748
No, no.

09:47.750 --> 09:50.417
We designed an experiment
involving you.

09:50.419 --> 09:52.853
See? Now, isn't that
interesting?

09:52.855 --> 09:55.189
It's not interesting.

09:55.191 --> 09:57.057
It's incredibly insulting.

09:57.059 --> 09:59.393
Okay,
maybe this will help--

09:59.395 --> 10:01.795
imagine you're holding a pen.

10:03.832 --> 10:06.333
Before you go too far,
not a special pen

10:06.335 --> 10:07.835
with your initials
engraved on it--

10:07.837 --> 10:09.403
that'll make the next part
really hard.

10:09.405 --> 10:10.405
Oh...

10:10.406 --> 10:11.406
That's it.

10:11.407 --> 10:12.407
Get out!

10:12.408 --> 10:14.408
I don't understand
why you're mad at me.

10:14.410 --> 10:16.076
You should be mad
at Amy.

10:16.078 --> 10:18.045
Like I was
this afternoon.

10:18.047 --> 10:19.713
Hey, look at that--
I let it go.

10:19.715 --> 10:21.148
Get out!

10:23.852 --> 10:25.219
Penny?
What?

10:25.221 --> 10:28.188
I think I left
my pen in there.

10:31.459 --> 10:33.460
I understand
why you're upset,

10:33.462 --> 10:35.929
but he worked really hard
to get the store ready.

10:35.931 --> 10:38.399
And it's just furniture.

10:38.401 --> 10:40.234
It's my mom's furniture.

10:40.236 --> 10:42.236
It belongs in the house
I grew up in--

10:42.238 --> 10:43.737
next to that pile of <i>TV Guides</i>

10:43.739 --> 10:46.740
and in plain view of what,
for a ten-year-old, was

10:46.742 --> 10:48.409
a quality piece
of string art!

10:51.780 --> 10:54.314
Howie, if the store succeeds,
Stuart has a source of income,

10:54.316 --> 10:56.650
and he can move out
of your mother's house.

10:56.652 --> 10:58.585
Seems like some old furniture
is a reasonable price

10:58.587 --> 10:59.653
to pay for that.

11:01.022 --> 11:02.423
That is a good point.

11:02.425 --> 11:04.058
But I didn't marry you
for good points.

11:04.060 --> 11:05.492
I married you
to blindly support me

11:05.494 --> 11:07.461
no matter how ridiculous
I'm being!

11:09.497 --> 11:11.632
This is why I had
to rewrite our wedding vows.

11:16.104 --> 11:19.339
Hi, we're here to pick up
an order for Comic Center.

11:19.341 --> 11:20.808
Sure, let me go check on that.

11:22.510 --> 11:25.779
Dude, I-I think
that's Nathan Fillion.

11:26.915 --> 11:28.916
Oh yeah,
look at that.

11:28.918 --> 11:31.351
And he's picking
the tomatoes out of his salad

11:31.353 --> 11:33.353
just like I do.

11:33.355 --> 11:35.389
I always did feel
a connection with him.

11:37.358 --> 11:39.159
Oh, I have got
an idea.

11:39.161 --> 11:42.096
We're not selling
his tomatoes on eBay.

11:42.098 --> 11:46.100
No, if we got Captain Reynolds
from <i>Firefly</i>

11:46.102 --> 11:48.435
to do a signing
at Stuart's store,

11:48.437 --> 11:49.870
that would be
amazing.

11:49.872 --> 11:51.205
That would be great.

11:51.207 --> 11:52.973
So should we go
talk to him?

11:52.975 --> 11:54.374
I don't know.

11:54.376 --> 11:57.044
I mean, if he's not nice,
it's gonna make it hard for me

11:57.046 --> 11:59.213
to watch him in anything again.
What?!

11:59.215 --> 12:02.216
The-the guy who plays
Jon Snow was a jerk.

12:02.218 --> 12:03.684
We still watch
Game of Thrones.

12:03.686 --> 12:06.286
He was a jerk because
you rear-ended him.

12:07.322 --> 12:08.989
I was distracted.

12:08.991 --> 12:10.991
It's weird seeing a member
of the Night's Watch

12:10.993 --> 12:12.526
with a kayak strapped
to his car.

12:14.229 --> 12:15.229
Come on.

12:20.335 --> 12:22.136
Hi,
excuse me, s-s...

12:22.138 --> 12:23.470
I-I don't mean
to bother you,

12:23.472 --> 12:25.806
but we're just really
big fans of <i>Firefly.</i>

12:25.808 --> 12:27.374
A-And <i>Dr. Horrible.</i>

12:27.376 --> 12:29.309
Oh, uh, I think
you made a mistake.

12:29.311 --> 12:30.644
I'm not an actor.

12:30.646 --> 12:32.980
Don't say that.

12:32.982 --> 12:34.481
I mean, you're not
Dame Judi Dench,

12:34.483 --> 12:36.150
but you're
pretty great.

12:39.387 --> 12:41.555
Oh, yeah, I get it--
you think I'm Nathan Fillion,

12:41.557 --> 12:43.056
but I'm not.

12:43.058 --> 12:45.492
So if you don't mind, I would
just love to eat my lunch.

12:46.861 --> 12:47.861
Come on.

12:47.863 --> 12:49.696
Sorry to bother you.

12:49.698 --> 12:51.698
Don't know why
he's so grumpy.

12:51.700 --> 12:54.034
I got mistaken for that guy
in <i>Life of Pi</i> once,

12:54.036 --> 12:56.403
and I'm still
floating.

12:59.107 --> 13:01.909
Sheldon, it's me.

13:01.911 --> 13:02.911
Oh, hey.

13:02.912 --> 13:04.745
D-Did you see that?

13:04.747 --> 13:08.315
I-I figured out how to open
the door all by myself.

13:09.951 --> 13:13.787
Maybe I'll fling some feces
around my cage to celebrate.

13:15.123 --> 13:17.291
What are you talking about?

13:17.293 --> 13:19.560
I know you've been giving me
secret puzzle tests.

13:22.564 --> 13:24.231
Sheldon, open
the door.

13:24.233 --> 13:25.899
I can't.

13:25.901 --> 13:28.902
I'm naked.

13:28.904 --> 13:30.904
I just saw you.

13:30.906 --> 13:33.207
Hang on.

13:33.209 --> 13:35.776
Open the door now.

13:35.778 --> 13:37.444
- Oh, hey.
- Pull up your pants!

13:40.615 --> 13:41.949
It's not a big deal.

13:41.951 --> 13:45.152
I run tests like this on
undergrads all the time.

13:45.154 --> 13:46.820
If you fill out some
paperwork at the university,

13:46.822 --> 13:49.122
I can get you $5.

13:49.124 --> 13:50.791
I don't want $5.

13:50.793 --> 13:52.359
I want my dignity.

13:53.728 --> 13:55.395
So what are we talking,
like, ten bucks?

13:57.865 --> 13:59.433
Thank you.
Thanks.

14:01.603 --> 14:03.503
Sorry again.
No problem.

14:03.505 --> 14:06.673
A-Are you sure
you're not him?

14:06.675 --> 14:07.841
Uh, you can tell us.

14:07.843 --> 14:10.444
We're scientists,
not crazy fanboys.

14:12.480 --> 14:13.981
All right, fine.

14:13.983 --> 14:15.449
I'm him.

14:15.451 --> 14:18.785
And you're eating
alone at a deli.

14:18.787 --> 14:20.988
I don't buy it--
you're not him.

14:22.324 --> 14:24.157
I just wanted
to eat my lunch in peace.

14:24.159 --> 14:25.325
But I really am him.

14:25.327 --> 14:27.427
And thank you very much
for being a fan.

14:27.429 --> 14:28.962
If you want, uh,
let's take a picture.

14:28.964 --> 14:30.297
That would be great.

14:30.299 --> 14:31.431
Great.
Yeah, thank you.

14:31.433 --> 14:32.766
You bet.

14:36.504 --> 14:38.839
Wait, hang on.

14:38.841 --> 14:41.208
If you're really
Nathan Fillion,

14:41.210 --> 14:44.244
what's the line from <i>Firefly</i>
<i>about your bonnet?</i>

14:45.647 --> 14:47.981
"I swear by my pretty floral
bonnet, I will end you."

14:50.285 --> 14:51.785
That's it,
that's the line.

14:51.787 --> 14:53.787
Although...

14:53.789 --> 14:56.490
I knew the line--
doesn't make me Nathan Fillion.

14:57.625 --> 14:59.893
Do you want the picture or not?

14:59.895 --> 15:02.729
I want a picture
with Nathan Fillion.

15:02.731 --> 15:06.066
How about a picture with a guy
who looks like Nathan Fillion

15:06.068 --> 15:09.303
but a little more annoyed
than Nathan Fillion usually is?

15:11.906 --> 15:12.939
What do you think?

15:14.309 --> 15:15.642
Eh, it's good enough
for Facebook.

15:23.651 --> 15:25.218
I can't believe
they did that.

15:25.220 --> 15:27.220
I know-- it's so insulting.

15:27.222 --> 15:28.889
At one point,
they had me figure out

15:28.891 --> 15:31.858
how to get a banana
out of a puzzle box.

15:31.860 --> 15:34.861
Wait, Sheldon gave me
a banana in a box.

15:34.863 --> 15:37.064
He was testing me, too.

15:37.066 --> 15:39.066
Unbelievable.

15:39.068 --> 15:40.901
And how could a chimp
even solve that?

15:40.903 --> 15:42.402
That was impossible.

15:42.404 --> 15:44.771
Really? You couldn't get it out?

15:48.376 --> 15:49.710
Thank you.

15:49.712 --> 15:51.712
Wow, the
store looks great.

15:51.714 --> 15:53.714
So you guys were
testing us both?

15:53.716 --> 15:54.748
What is the
matter with you?

15:54.750 --> 15:56.249
Eh, what's
the matter with them is

15:56.251 --> 15:57.851
they think they're so smart
they don't care

15:57.853 --> 15:59.519
if they hurt
other people's feelings.

15:59.521 --> 16:01.188
Sounds like us.
That's not true.

16:03.858 --> 16:06.526
I still don't understand
why you're upset.

16:06.528 --> 16:09.529
You solved every puzzle faster
than all of the chimps.

16:09.531 --> 16:12.199
Well, except Barnabas,
but he was on Adderall.

16:13.701 --> 16:16.203
I'm sorry, but it's
making me crazy.

16:16.205 --> 16:18.538
Can you please
just let it go?

16:18.540 --> 16:20.507
Oh, I can help
you with that.

16:21.876 --> 16:24.311
Imagine you're holding
an ordinary pen.

16:26.381 --> 16:29.383
While your favorite pen is
safe and secure in your pocket.

16:32.020 --> 16:33.787
Hold that thought.

16:33.789 --> 16:34.789
Hello?

16:34.790 --> 16:37.057
How can I make this up
to you?

16:37.059 --> 16:39.726
The answer's
in this puzzle box.

16:39.728 --> 16:41.895
Let's see
if you can open it.

16:45.199 --> 16:47.734
You could have at least warned
him about the furniture.

16:47.736 --> 16:49.803
That's what I said
when we moved it.

16:49.805 --> 16:51.304
You helped him?!

16:51.306 --> 16:54.307
No, Stuart picked out those
throw pillows all on his own.

16:58.513 --> 17:00.514
Hey, you okay?

17:00.516 --> 17:01.948
Uh, no.

17:01.950 --> 17:03.116
What's wrong?

17:03.118 --> 17:05.117
Um...

17:05.119 --> 17:07.621
my mom died.

17:07.623 --> 17:09.723
What?

17:09.724 --> 17:12.058
Uh...

17:12.060 --> 17:15.060
that was my aunt.

17:15.063 --> 17:18.064
Ma took a nap.

17:18.066 --> 17:19.398
She never woke up.

17:20.435 --> 17:22.435
Oh, my God, Howie.

17:24.939 --> 17:26.807
I'm so sorry.

17:28.075 --> 17:29.409
What can we do?

17:32.113 --> 17:34.114
I don't know.

17:38.519 --> 17:40.320
May I say something?

17:40.322 --> 17:41.655
Not right
now, Sheldon.

17:41.657 --> 17:42.989
But I think it would
be comforting.

17:42.991 --> 17:44.925
Buddy...
No, it's okay.

17:44.927 --> 17:46.827
What?

17:47.862 --> 17:50.530
When I lost my own father,

17:50.532 --> 17:52.732
I didn't have any friends
to help me through it.

17:54.001 --> 17:55.635
You do.

18:01.142 --> 18:04.211
I really thought
he was gonna say, "Let it go."

18:16.095 --> 18:17.694
Okay, thanks, Bernadette.

18:17.696 --> 18:19.362
Travel safe.

18:19.364 --> 18:22.032
Okay, bye.

18:23.368 --> 18:24.534
They booked a flight.

18:24.536 --> 18:25.769
They're heading
to the airport now.

18:25.771 --> 18:27.571
How's Howard holding up?

18:27.573 --> 18:28.905
He's hanging in there.

18:28.907 --> 18:30.540
How are you doing, Stuart?

18:32.577 --> 18:33.910
Still can't believe she's gone.

18:33.912 --> 18:36.880
I mean, that woman took me in.

18:36.882 --> 18:39.616
If it wasn't for her,
I-I would have been homeless.

18:39.618 --> 18:41.618
One of us would
have taken you in.

18:41.620 --> 18:43.920
Yeah, I don't recall any offers.

18:45.723 --> 18:48.391
But, you know, uh, I-I'm glad
it worked out the way it did

18:48.393 --> 18:52.462
because I got to know
this wonderful person.

18:52.464 --> 18:54.131
Yeah.

18:54.133 --> 18:56.032
Mrs. Wolowitz was
pretty special.

18:56.034 --> 18:58.301
When I first moved to America,

18:58.303 --> 19:00.837
Howard was my only friend.

19:00.839 --> 19:04.074
She made me feel
so welcome in her home.

19:04.076 --> 19:07.077
Which says a lot,
because, those first few years,

19:07.079 --> 19:09.746
she thought I was the gardener.

19:10.882 --> 19:12.549
Whenever I saw her,

19:12.551 --> 19:15.552
she'd say I was too skinny
and try and feed me.

19:17.156 --> 19:19.089
She did that to me, too.

19:19.091 --> 19:21.458
Don't take this away from me.

19:22.593 --> 19:25.095
I didn't care
for her yelling.

19:25.097 --> 19:28.098
But now that I'm not going
to hear it again,

19:28.100 --> 19:29.666
I'm sad.

19:29.668 --> 19:31.668
If you want,
I can yell at you later.

19:34.505 --> 19:35.805
It won't be as good.

19:38.843 --> 19:40.243
Let's have a toast.

19:42.346 --> 19:44.014
To Mrs. Wolowitz.

19:44.893 --> 19:46.859
A loving mother...

19:49.863 --> 19:51.864
...to all of us.

19:51.866 --> 19:53.733
We'll miss you.
