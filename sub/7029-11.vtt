00:00.089 --> 00:03.330
Tonight on the curse of Oak Island

00:03.330 --> 00:05.110
there's your artifact we did some tests

00:05.110 --> 00:06.680
on I think it has an interesting story

00:06.680 --> 00:09.880
to tell we're gonna try one more diver

00:09.880 --> 00:12.790
and if he can't do it we're done with

00:12.790 --> 00:14.660
I'm down here zero visibility we little

00:14.660 --> 00:17.949
good this is a little burdensome model

00:17.949 --> 00:20.020
where he thinks the money is is right

00:20.020 --> 00:23.830
here you put an X

00:23.830 --> 00:30.060
let's get steel dog halt figure this

00:30.060 --> 00:31.850
thing off

00:31.850 --> 00:35.300
there is an island in the North Atlantic

00:35.300 --> 00:36.930
where people have been looking for an

00:36.930 --> 00:40.210
incredible treasure for more than 200

00:40.210 --> 00:44.170
years so far they have found bits of

00:44.170 --> 00:47.340
gold chain a stone slab with strange

00:47.340 --> 00:49.290
symbols carved into it

00:49.290 --> 00:53.180
even a 17th century Spanish coin today

00:53.180 --> 00:57.680
six men have died trying to solve the

00:57.680 --> 00:59.220
mystery

00:59.220 --> 01:00.290
and according to legend

01:00.390 --> 01:05.619
one more will have to die before the

01:07.000 --> 01:13.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:17.719 --> 01:20.810
treasure can be found

01:20.810 --> 01:23.039
as a new week begins in the search to

01:23.039 --> 01:26.619
find treasure on Oak Island Rick and

01:26.619 --> 01:29.979
Marty lagina along with Marty's son Alex

01:29.979 --> 01:32.840
Craig tester and Dave Blankenship have

01:32.840 --> 01:35.039
traveled 50 miles northeast of Oak

01:35.039 --> 01:37.750
Island to st. Mary's University in

01:37.750 --> 01:40.779
Halifax

01:40.779 --> 01:43.149
here we are after you you have to get

01:43.149 --> 01:45.509
the good you can get the goods here's

01:45.509 --> 01:47.380
what you've been waiting for gentlemen

01:47.380 --> 01:50.249
let's see it they are eager to determine

01:50.249 --> 01:52.729
if an object resembling an ancient Roman

01:52.729 --> 01:55.369
sword which was reportedly found in the

01:55.369 --> 01:58.069
waters just off the coast of Oak Island

01:58.069 --> 02:00.130
is real Oh

02:00.130 --> 02:04.929
the hell is this source the Roman sword

02:04.929 --> 02:08.709
that is phenomenal today the team has

02:08.709 --> 02:10.780
arranged to meet with professor miles

02:10.780 --> 02:14.180
McCallum an expert on Roman archaeology

02:14.180 --> 02:17.280
five miles they are hoping he can

02:17.280 --> 02:19.500
determine if the sword they've acquired

02:19.500 --> 02:22.310
could be an important piece of evidence

02:22.310 --> 02:24.030
one which connects the Oak Island

02:24.030 --> 02:27.980
mystery to the ancient Roman Empire in

02:27.980 --> 02:29.069
the lab you are gonna have to ask you

02:29.069 --> 02:31.569
guys to put on some safety glasses and

02:31.569 --> 02:34.340
some lab coats here I'll hold after it

02:34.340 --> 02:44.049
is oh that's it nice bronze silver

02:44.049 --> 02:46.790
although it may seem unlikely that a

02:46.790 --> 02:49.430
Roman sword dating from the reign of the

02:49.430 --> 02:51.599
Emperor Commodus in the second century

02:51.599 --> 02:54.430
AD could find itself in the waters off

02:54.430 --> 02:55.430
Nova Scotia

02:55.430 --> 02:57.980
there are many Oak Island theorists who

02:57.980 --> 03:01.749
believe it is more than possible

03:01.749 --> 03:04.840
in recent decades several ancient coins

03:04.840 --> 03:07.349
identified as being Carthaginian in

03:07.349 --> 03:10.180
origin or found in the coastal regions

03:10.180 --> 03:13.269
just north of Oak Island the

03:13.269 --> 03:16.129
Carthaginians were a seafaring people

03:16.129 --> 03:17.910
who dominated the trade routes of the

03:17.910 --> 03:21.269
Mediterranean during the period from 600

03:21.269 --> 03:25.409
to 200 BC it has long been speculated

03:25.409 --> 03:28.109
that their knowledge of navigation along

03:28.109 --> 03:29.709
with their shipbuilding and sailing

03:29.709 --> 03:32.330
prowess would have made it possible for

03:32.330 --> 03:34.620
them to successfully navigate the rugged

03:34.620 --> 03:38.840
waters of the North Atlantic

03:38.840 --> 03:41.060
if it plays out that it is in eighteen

03:41.060 --> 03:43.689
hundred year old Roman sword what's

03:43.689 --> 03:46.340
significant does it provide a certain

03:46.340 --> 03:49.360
historical context if it is real yes it

03:49.360 --> 03:53.230
does as far as you know iconography if

03:53.230 --> 03:55.219
it is obviously a representation of

03:55.219 --> 03:58.079
demigod Hercules who's a really

03:58.079 --> 03:59.819
important figure among the Romans

03:59.819 --> 04:03.019
religiously as far as you know how it's

04:03.019 --> 04:05.999
made that's a bit odd normally you'd

04:05.999 --> 04:08.569
expect this to be a single cast piece

04:08.569 --> 04:11.279
does this one not done in one piece then

04:11.279 --> 04:12.939
with respect this I mean looking at it

04:12.939 --> 04:14.850
if we look down the side here you can

04:14.850 --> 04:17.269
see where there's there's a line that

04:17.269 --> 04:18.889
goes right up through there this

04:18.889 --> 04:21.029
suggests to me that it's a bivalve mould

04:21.029 --> 04:23.259
instead of a single lost-wax marker so

04:23.259 --> 04:25.491
something again like this this was never

04:25.491 --> 04:29.330
a functional sword it's simply a work of

04:29.330 --> 04:33.349
art in the year 70 AD future roman

04:33.349 --> 04:35.930
emperor titus led the siege that

04:35.930 --> 04:39.080
conquered Jerusalem in the process his

04:39.080 --> 04:41.210
armies burned and destroyed the so

04:41.210 --> 04:44.030
called second temple where the original

04:44.030 --> 04:47.560
temple of King Solomon once stood

04:47.560 --> 04:49.690
when 12 years later the arch of Titus

04:49.690 --> 04:51.729
was erected in Rome to celebrate the

04:51.729 --> 04:54.979
victory it depicted a large golden

04:54.979 --> 04:57.710
menorah one of the sacred objects taken

04:57.710 --> 05:01.060
from the temple which like the Ark of

05:01.060 --> 05:03.960
the Covenant and the Holy Grail many

05:03.960 --> 05:06.150
researchers believe were later buried on

05:06.150 --> 05:09.210
Oak Island

05:09.210 --> 05:11.460
is it possible that the Romans like the

05:11.460 --> 05:13.910
Carthaginians before them could have

05:13.910 --> 05:16.750
traveled to Nova Scotia nearly 2,000

05:16.750 --> 05:21.930
years ago and if so would a Roman sword

05:21.930 --> 05:24.430
found in the waters off Oak Island

05:24.430 --> 05:28.250
provide the proof give us a percent

05:28.250 --> 05:30.152
percent chance percent chance that this

05:30.152 --> 05:32.700
is something Roman I'm not really in a

05:32.700 --> 05:34.500
position to tell you at this point from

05:34.500 --> 05:36.580
you know just looking at it as we have

05:36.580 --> 05:38.720
it here I'm highly skeptical just based

05:38.720 --> 05:40.139
on the construction technique that it's

05:40.139 --> 05:43.900
actually ancient to would fake that I

05:43.900 --> 05:45.960
don't know you know it could even be a

05:45.960 --> 05:48.180
fake that's not.you know a modern fake

05:48.180 --> 05:49.680
right it could be a fake from the 19th

05:49.680 --> 05:51.690
or 18th century from an Oak Island

05:51.690 --> 05:52.690
standpoint it would actually it'd

05:52.690 --> 05:56.580
probably be more significant it was the

05:56.580 --> 05:59.550
1700s yeoman it could be something it

05:59.550 --> 06:00.770
could actually be an antiquity that was

06:00.770 --> 06:02.199
in the possession of somebody who came

06:02.199 --> 06:04.280
over long after that right to end course

06:04.280 --> 06:06.169
lost it and so that that's probably if

06:06.169 --> 06:08.280
this is something that's old that's a

06:08.280 --> 06:10.970
much more likely explanation why does

06:10.970 --> 06:13.340
somebody go to the effort to duplicate

06:13.340 --> 06:16.340
or fake something that almost no one in

06:16.340 --> 06:18.919
the world has seen I mean I haven't

06:18.919 --> 06:20.710
ruled it out yet it still could have

06:20.710 --> 06:22.270
significance to what we're doing here

06:22.270 --> 06:24.289
it's an intriguing object what is

06:24.289 --> 06:26.370
definitive test to see what definitive

06:26.370 --> 06:30.190
tests you can do a chemical analysis of

06:30.190 --> 06:32.760
the bronze or brass I can put you in

06:32.760 --> 06:34.770
touch with dr. christow Brousseau who's

06:34.770 --> 06:36.870
in the chemistry department and she and

06:36.870 --> 06:38.599
her graduate students can can do the

06:38.599 --> 06:40.180
testing for you great if you're

06:40.180 --> 06:42.250
interested in oh yeah we are all right

06:42.250 --> 06:43.640
well let's do the other testing that

06:43.640 --> 06:45.669
sounds great thank you very much very

06:45.669 --> 06:49.610
informative thanks for coming

06:49.610 --> 06:52.080
well Rick Marty and their partners wait

06:52.080 --> 06:54.000
for the results of the tests on the

06:54.000 --> 06:57.900
sword back on Oak Island Jack Begley

06:57.900 --> 07:00.100
Peter Fornetti and veteran treasure

07:00.100 --> 07:02.840
hunter dan henskee are about to begin an

07:02.840 --> 07:05.639
investigation of their own at Smith's

07:05.639 --> 07:08.000
Cove

07:08.000 --> 07:10.530
so this time we're on an eel grass hunt

07:10.530 --> 07:11.530
right

07:11.530 --> 07:13.379
good luck how about we go back to that

07:13.379 --> 07:16.830
same spot we found the coconut fiber in

07:16.830 --> 07:20.199
18-49 while looking for the source of

07:20.199 --> 07:22.129
the ocean water that flooded the money

07:22.129 --> 07:25.189
pit members of the recently formed Truro

07:25.189 --> 07:27.759
syndicate discovered an elaborate and

07:27.759 --> 07:30.689
ingenious system of manmade box drains

07:30.689 --> 07:34.710
originating at Smith's Cove made up of

07:34.710 --> 07:37.539
flat stones supported by smaller ones

07:37.539 --> 07:39.569
and then densely packed with other

07:39.569 --> 07:42.560
stones the bunks drains appeared to be

07:42.560 --> 07:44.810
similar in construction to the roads

07:44.810 --> 07:47.940
that were built in ancient Rome to hide

07:47.940 --> 07:49.970
the box drains from view they were

07:49.970 --> 07:52.300
covered and by a layer of gravel and

07:52.300 --> 07:54.960
sand under which there were layers of

07:54.960 --> 07:58.699
both coconut fiber and eel grass the

07:58.699 --> 08:01.099
coconut fiber was used to prevent debris

08:01.099 --> 08:03.599
from clogging the drains while the eel

08:03.599 --> 08:06.220
grass helped to soak up the excess water

08:06.220 --> 08:11.389
two years ago dan henskee along with

08:11.389 --> 08:14.330
Peter Fornetti Alex lagina and Jack

08:14.330 --> 08:18.500
Begley found coconut fiber

08:18.500 --> 08:20.810
which when tested was estimated to be

08:20.810 --> 08:24.620
between 600 and 800 years old they're

08:24.620 --> 08:29.630
dating between 1260 and 1400 AD so it's

08:29.630 --> 08:31.800
did they give you like a degree of

08:31.800 --> 08:38.169
accuracy 95% do you think that there's

08:38.169 --> 08:40.350
any eel grass that's left in its fibers

08:40.350 --> 08:42.640
for me sure about the longevity the

08:42.640 --> 08:45.890
coconut fiber lasts half way forever but

08:45.890 --> 08:50.270
eel grass I think decays a lot faster

08:50.270 --> 08:52.890
because eel grass decomposes at a faster

08:52.890 --> 08:56.010
rate than coconut fiber finding a sample

08:56.010 --> 08:58.210
at Smith's Cove and then carbon dating

08:58.210 --> 09:00.540
it might provide the Oak Island team a

09:00.540 --> 09:03.260
significant breakthrough it would give

09:03.260 --> 09:05.520
them a more accurate date as to win the

09:05.520 --> 09:07.880
box drains and possibly the money pit

09:07.880 --> 09:11.020
were constructed it might also tell them

09:11.020 --> 09:13.000
whether or not the eel grass was

09:13.000 --> 09:15.630
harvested locally or based on its

09:15.630 --> 09:18.340
species if it was brought to Oak Island

09:18.340 --> 09:21.960
from another region much farther away

09:21.960 --> 09:25.010
but this is pretty close to the area so

09:25.010 --> 09:26.680
that's what I'm guess I'll stand back

09:26.680 --> 09:33.430
and watch out for flying sand and we'll

09:33.430 --> 09:42.460
see what's there we're getting pretty

09:42.460 --> 09:48.480
good at digging holes

09:48.480 --> 09:50.620
shouldn't we have already seen it by now

09:50.620 --> 09:52.880
I have dug a bit on the shore on this

09:52.880 --> 09:56.960
place I believe

09:56.960 --> 09:59.200
oh good job yeah

09:59.200 --> 10:18.990
Oh

10:18.990 --> 10:20.940
while searching for eel grass at Smith's

10:20.940 --> 10:24.210
Cove veteran treasure hunter dan henskee

10:24.210 --> 10:26.110
may have just made an important

10:26.110 --> 10:27.690
discovery

10:27.690 --> 10:30.150
wait that is coconut fiber it might be a

10:30.150 --> 10:32.120
little in there but mostly it's just

10:32.120 --> 10:33.400
some odd vegetation

10:33.400 --> 10:35.640
I won't say it's not eel grass I think

10:35.640 --> 10:37.260
this is the old coconut fiber looks like

10:37.260 --> 10:39.870
horsehair well see to wash it off and

10:39.870 --> 10:41.640
the but I didn't find that much but I

10:41.640 --> 10:44.080
might have missed something yeah because

10:44.080 --> 10:46.690
coconut fiber is known to be one of the

10:46.690 --> 10:48.900
materials used in the construction of

10:48.900 --> 10:50.430
the booby-trapped flood tunnels at

10:50.430 --> 10:53.370
Smith's Cove if the team is founded they

10:53.370 --> 10:55.850
should also be able to find eel grass in

10:55.850 --> 10:58.360
the same vicinity that's certainly a lot

10:58.360 --> 10:59.890
of fibers in it when there were kind of

10:59.890 --> 11:04.940
a that looks like it might be material

11:04.940 --> 11:07.900
or something this is the eel grass

11:07.900 --> 11:10.520
because it's kind of it's in layers

11:10.520 --> 11:13.620
actually maybe you actually found some

11:13.620 --> 11:18.820
eel grass they should bag this if Dan

11:18.820 --> 11:22.120
Jack and Peter have found eel grass and

11:22.120 --> 11:24.460
it can be accurately dated to sometime

11:24.460 --> 11:29.200
before 1795 then the team may be able to

11:29.200 --> 11:31.930
figure out not only when the money pit

11:31.930 --> 11:35.410
was constructed but also who built it

11:35.410 --> 11:37.690
and what it was that needed to be so

11:37.690 --> 11:40.920
ingeniously hidden

11:40.920 --> 11:42.860
I'd say we complete our giant as well as

11:42.860 --> 11:45.370
we could today yeah and quick to thanks

11:45.370 --> 11:49.800
to Dan thank you who gets to carry the

11:49.800 --> 11:50.800
shovels sir

11:50.800 --> 11:53.930
hello you do I'm great nothing like

11:53.930 --> 11:56.500
being the old guy

11:56.500 --> 11:59.060
before the Sun sets on another day at

11:59.060 --> 12:04.340
Oak Island

12:04.340 --> 12:06.660
Rick lagina Craig tester and Dave

12:06.660 --> 12:09.220
Blankenship convene in the war room to

12:09.220 --> 12:13.540
make a very important call almost time

12:13.540 --> 12:16.770
give them a call yeah I hope we hear all

12:16.770 --> 12:18.700
the right things is what I hope I want

12:18.700 --> 12:20.480
to hear from him that look and the ideas

12:20.480 --> 12:22.080
then get in the chamber and get you

12:22.080 --> 12:27.120
answers so far two previous attempts to

12:27.120 --> 12:29.080
place a diver at the bottom of borehole

12:29.080 --> 12:39.470
10x have ended unsuccessfully

12:39.470 --> 12:41.750
nevertheless the team remains more

12:41.750 --> 12:44.130
convinced than ever that not only is

12:44.130 --> 12:46.770
such a difficult time possible but it is

12:46.770 --> 12:49.190
essential if they are ever to find out

12:49.190 --> 12:51.680
once and for all if the mysterious

12:51.680 --> 12:55.980
cavern that exists 235 feet below ground

12:55.980 --> 12:58.670
really is a man-made gateway into the

12:58.670 --> 13:00.280
money pit

13:00.280 --> 13:05.160
complete with antique tools a wooden

13:05.160 --> 13:06.160
chest

13:06.160 --> 13:09.300
and possibly human remains

13:09.300 --> 13:14.810
we're gonna try one more diver the most

13:14.810 --> 13:16.870
qualified diver we could possibly have

13:16.870 --> 13:20.060
found John Chatterton and if he can't do

13:20.060 --> 13:22.220
it we're done with divers what agreed on

13:22.220 --> 13:25.620
that right question about that

13:25.620 --> 13:27.490
John Chatterton is a world renowned

13:27.490 --> 13:30.310
deep-sea and wreck diver with more than

13:30.310 --> 13:32.940
30 years of experience diving in some of

13:32.940 --> 13:34.700
the most dangerous and difficult

13:34.700 --> 13:39.070
environments from shipwrecks to

13:39.070 --> 13:42.580
underwater structures his desire to

13:42.580 --> 13:45.440
explore and solve underwater mysteries

13:45.440 --> 13:47.060
has taken him to such famed

13:47.060 --> 13:49.970
sunken vessels as the Britannic the

13:49.970 --> 13:54.920
Lusitania the Andrea Doria and the

13:54.920 --> 14:02.460
Titanic it's ringing up see what happens

14:02.460 --> 14:14.660
hey guys John Hart oh yeah we'll be

14:14.660 --> 14:22.640
better when you get here

14:22.640 --> 14:29.650
our preps going okay it was an awkward

14:29.650 --> 14:32.180
entry and exit for a previous dive team

14:32.180 --> 14:37.290
well they had tanks on

14:37.290 --> 14:40.350
use umbilicals at the right technology

14:40.350 --> 14:43.370
we've got the right experience to do

14:43.370 --> 14:47.290
this time to die and we're gonna be

14:47.290 --> 14:48.550
thoroughly prepared you're gonna be

14:48.550 --> 14:50.950
relying on your top man to tell you how

14:50.950 --> 14:53.280
deep you are because you can't see I'm

14:53.280 --> 14:55.140
telling it zero visibility

14:55.140 --> 15:02.060
we don't need visibility to determine

15:02.060 --> 15:12.130
what you guys want

15:12.130 --> 15:14.200
that's a pheromone interest to us all

15:14.200 --> 15:15.670
right

15:15.670 --> 15:17.950
my concern is get him safely from

15:17.950 --> 15:22.800
surface to cavity and back to surface

15:22.800 --> 15:24.620
and for me the troubling aspect of

15:24.620 --> 15:27.741
course would be the drill bar that drill

15:27.741 --> 15:31.170
bar would be down you know 20 25 feet

15:31.170 --> 15:39.090
below the top of that 27-inch hole

15:39.090 --> 15:45.080
27-inch at we dropped a field finder in

15:45.080 --> 15:48.050
there a well-worn casing instrument and

15:48.050 --> 15:51.800
it seemed to indicate that the top of

15:51.800 --> 15:54.640
the bar was at 204 feet which would put

15:54.640 --> 15:58.610
it 23 feet below the anhydrite surprises

15:58.610 --> 16:06.060
we can't possibly tell you what we're

16:06.060 --> 16:12.830
gonna find but we will get to or at

16:12.830 --> 16:20.330
least as far as is humanly bus okay we

16:20.330 --> 16:22.610
got high hopes for John Chatterton he's

16:22.610 --> 16:24.560
the best based on all our research he's

16:24.560 --> 16:26.390
the best I'm not dissing anybody has

16:26.390 --> 16:28.230
already been in there they they did what

16:28.230 --> 16:30.050
they could if anyone can get down in

16:30.050 --> 16:32.591
that cavity and come up with proof if it

16:32.591 --> 16:35.690
is in the cavity he can so I'm excited

16:35.690 --> 16:36.690
about that

16:36.690 --> 16:38.740
obviously well guys I think you've

16:38.740 --> 16:39.740
covered everything

16:39.740 --> 16:41.750
look we very much look forward to and

16:41.750 --> 16:43.790
appreciate all your efforts we can't

16:43.790 --> 16:45.800
wait to get this started

16:45.800 --> 16:50.800
awesome okay you take care that was a

16:50.800 --> 16:52.800
good day yeah sure was okay let's go do

16:52.800 --> 17:01.670
something else

17:01.670 --> 17:03.440
while waiting for diver John chattered

17:03.440 --> 17:06.970
and to come to Oak Island Rick lagina

17:06.970 --> 17:09.299
and members of his team have arranged to

17:09.299 --> 17:12.250
meet with father-and-son engineers Mike

17:12.250 --> 17:15.189
and Sean Harold thanks for inviting us

17:15.189 --> 17:18.000
out the Herald's have traveled all the

17:18.000 --> 17:20.559
way from British Columbia in hopes of

17:20.559 --> 17:23.300
sharing information that they believe

17:23.300 --> 17:25.439
will help the laginas and their partners

17:25.439 --> 17:29.659
solve the 220 year old mystery this is

17:29.659 --> 17:31.769
what we've affectionately called the

17:31.769 --> 17:35.320
water room hey guys the Herald's are

17:35.320 --> 17:37.690
distant relatives of the now deceased

17:37.690 --> 17:40.000
Oak Island treasure hunter and author

17:40.000 --> 17:46.289
Laverne Johnson from 1959 to 1963

17:46.289 --> 17:47.570
Johnson believed he could solve the

17:47.570 --> 17:50.559
mystery by focusing on an area never

17:50.559 --> 17:53.370
explored before

17:53.370 --> 17:54.720
very much look forward to what's in the

17:54.720 --> 17:59.370
box I love Christmas yes okay

17:59.370 --> 18:02.009
so I wonder where we start first of all

18:02.009 --> 18:04.610
this is the book that Laverne wrote

18:04.610 --> 18:07.980
before he passed away he paid for it

18:07.980 --> 18:09.320
himself

18:09.320 --> 18:12.299
and he simply wanted to get his theory

18:12.299 --> 18:14.840
out there so it's all in here he

18:14.840 --> 18:18.570
revealed how he figured everything out

18:18.570 --> 18:20.200
unlike most other oak island treasure

18:20.200 --> 18:22.870
hunters Laverne Johnson believed the

18:22.870 --> 18:24.850
money pit was constructed and

18:24.850 --> 18:27.100
booby-trapped not to protect the

18:27.100 --> 18:29.429
treasure but to mislead and thwart

18:29.429 --> 18:31.400
would-be searchers from finding the

18:31.400 --> 18:36.139
treasures real location this was

18:36.139 --> 18:38.559
laverne's and model that he made up

18:38.559 --> 18:44.580
albeit very crude we actually have a

18:44.580 --> 18:47.360
picture of Laverne with this model oh do

18:47.360 --> 18:53.580
you yeah

18:53.580 --> 18:57.389
yeah that's Laverne using a survey

18:57.389 --> 18:59.279
commissioned by Oak Island treasure

18:59.279 --> 19:03.550
hunter Gilbert Hedden in 1937 Laverne

19:03.550 --> 19:05.710
Johnson believed that if he drew a line

19:05.710 --> 19:08.509
between two mysteriously drilled stones

19:08.509 --> 19:10.990
one found at Smith's Cove and another

19:10.990 --> 19:13.549
found north of the money pit and another

19:13.549 --> 19:15.220
drawn from the point of the stone

19:15.220 --> 19:18.190
triangle on the south shore the actual

19:18.190 --> 19:20.850
treasure shaft would be located above

19:20.850 --> 19:21.850
sea level

19:21.850 --> 19:25.889
and at a depth of approximately 30 feet

19:25.889 --> 19:27.760
but after several attempts to prove his

19:27.760 --> 19:31.450
theory correct Johnson ran out of money

19:31.450 --> 19:33.280
and like so many treasure hunters before

19:33.280 --> 19:36.840
him left Oak Island empty-handed

19:36.840 --> 19:40.899
the Byrnes theory is simply 14 degrees

19:40.899 --> 19:43.960
west of true north as where he thought

19:43.960 --> 19:47.110
whoever deposited something there dug

19:47.110 --> 19:49.210
down here and simply tunneled up to high

19:49.210 --> 19:52.090
ground and deposited whatever it was

19:52.090 --> 19:57.220
they were burying okay if you can see

19:57.220 --> 20:00.940
that that's the money pit coming down

20:00.940 --> 20:03.430
and the flood tunnel coming out to

20:03.430 --> 20:06.090
Smith's Cove flooding this tunnel I

20:06.090 --> 20:07.759
think he sure was the high-water mark on

20:07.759 --> 20:08.759
there

20:08.759 --> 20:14.549
it sure does - and that's full of urns

20:14.549 --> 20:18.499
treasure cache right there

20:18.499 --> 20:20.940
which puts it above sea level yeah it

20:20.940 --> 20:23.639
was about two to three hundred feet

20:23.639 --> 20:25.840
north of the money paper okay

20:25.840 --> 20:29.330
that was a very simple theory perhaps

20:29.330 --> 20:32.250
but maybe not I mean it look at we'd

20:32.250 --> 20:34.970
love to go out there actually I think

20:34.970 --> 20:36.480
Jack Charles could assist you in some

20:36.480 --> 20:39.169
way yeah okay you put an X we'll punch a

20:39.169 --> 20:42.830
hole I'll be great Laverne would like

20:42.830 --> 20:44.940
that I say we'd go out there today yeah

20:44.940 --> 20:50.549
let's go find a site let's do it

20:50.549 --> 20:53.749
with another new theory to explore the

20:53.749 --> 20:56.999
Oak Island team arrives at the money pit

20:56.999 --> 20:59.070
but unfortunately one of the key

20:59.070 --> 21:01.009
reference points they'll need in order

21:01.009 --> 21:03.440
to test Laverne Johnston's theory no

21:03.440 --> 21:07.169
longer exists the stone triangle which

21:07.169 --> 21:09.549
used to be located due south of the

21:09.549 --> 21:12.309
money pit

21:12.309 --> 21:15.399
well this is the famous money pit Kerry

21:15.399 --> 21:17.279
based on the work that Laverne Johnson

21:17.279 --> 21:19.860
did it came up with an x marks the spot

21:19.860 --> 21:22.710
but you know one little problem we have

21:22.710 --> 21:24.899
is based on the stone triangle where's

21:24.899 --> 21:27.120
that well that's been moved so we're

21:27.120 --> 21:29.350
gonna try to recreate what he did and

21:29.350 --> 21:31.049
come find x marks the spot

21:31.049 --> 21:33.610
hopefully read rill that and find the

21:33.610 --> 21:37.240
vault find the treasure because the apex

21:37.240 --> 21:39.759
of the triangle pointed north directly

21:39.759 --> 21:42.159
toward the money pit it was considered

21:42.159 --> 21:46.029
an important clue unfortunately during

21:46.029 --> 21:48.130
an extensive excavation by Robert

21:48.130 --> 21:52.499
Dunfield in 1965 the stone triangle and

21:52.499 --> 21:55.230
all evidence of its precise location was

21:55.230 --> 21:59.360
destroyed if Sean and Mike Harold are

21:59.360 --> 22:01.610
going to find the area where Laverne

22:01.610 --> 22:03.480
Johnson believed the treasure was buried

22:03.480 --> 22:06.580
they will need to lay out a grid over a

22:06.580 --> 22:10.240
wide area and then drill a series of

22:10.240 --> 22:14.190
50-foot deep exploratory holes I'm just

22:14.190 --> 22:17.539
trying to find true north which based on

22:17.539 --> 22:20.070
laverne's theory ran directly through

22:20.070 --> 22:23.200
the center of the money pit so 346 is

22:23.200 --> 22:25.700
about up in that direction so we need to

22:25.700 --> 22:29.399
head uphill 280 feet at this heading and

22:29.399 --> 22:31.590
I'd like to see what's up there okay

22:31.590 --> 22:33.070
let's get started

22:33.070 --> 22:36.350
can you call out the distances jack if

22:36.350 --> 22:39.720
you can sure here's 346 so maybe you

22:39.720 --> 22:41.389
guys can keep an eye on to make sure

22:41.389 --> 22:42.499
he's keeping his bearing

22:42.499 --> 22:45.970
okay what's your mark now Jack 90 feet

22:45.970 --> 22:48.240
that's gonna be interesting to see where

22:48.240 --> 22:53.100
he ends up 121 121 can you see him I

22:53.100 --> 22:54.100
can't see him

22:54.100 --> 22:59.010
171 what the hey Charles

22:59.010 --> 23:02.029
come here look at this what do you got

23:02.029 --> 23:06.220
it's a drill Drock I think what you see

23:06.220 --> 23:09.830
a drill Drock in the area where Laverne

23:09.830 --> 23:11.900
Johnson believed the original Oak Island

23:11.900 --> 23:14.830
treasure site is located could this be

23:14.830 --> 23:17.730
the same rock that Laverne Johnson used

23:17.730 --> 23:20.230
to develop his incredible theory that's

23:20.230 --> 23:23.330
gonna be 8 inches across right yeah it's

23:23.330 --> 23:25.220
just really weird Charles that this is

23:25.220 --> 23:27.299
great along the Laverne Johnson line I

23:27.299 --> 23:28.899
mean it doesn't look natural obviously

23:28.899 --> 23:30.610
this is man-made because you look we're

23:30.610 --> 23:32.499
in flat areas all around here then

23:32.499 --> 23:35.770
you've got this bump right so let's

23:35.770 --> 23:37.889
continue on you're very close to the 200

23:37.889 --> 23:39.080
foot level and then we got 80 feet

23:39.080 --> 23:41.289
beyond that so let's see where we land

23:41.289 --> 23:44.309
all right as in Jack and Charles

23:44.309 --> 23:46.320
continue to measure out a distance of

23:46.320 --> 23:49.759
280 feet for the team's drilling grid

23:49.759 --> 23:51.879
Craig tester along with Oak Island

23:51.879 --> 23:56.619
theorists Mike and Sean Herold join them

23:56.619 --> 23:59.731
okay so this is about 270 feet so we

23:59.731 --> 24:02.190
need to 80 why don't you go use the GPS

24:02.190 --> 24:04.379
and get us our our final spot all right

24:04.379 --> 24:10.210
but right here

24:10.210 --> 24:17.259
there's a little depression right

24:17.259 --> 24:18.940
interior and through here yeah there's

24:18.940 --> 24:21.500
certainly like a like a bowl type

24:21.500 --> 24:23.720
geometry on this that sort of gives it

24:23.720 --> 24:25.380
the appearance that's something settled

24:25.380 --> 24:27.190
or something potentially is collapsed

24:27.190 --> 24:30.240
down below to give this the shape here a

24:30.240 --> 24:33.590
possible collapse below the ground could

24:33.590 --> 24:36.119
this mean that an underground cavern or

24:36.119 --> 24:38.990
possible treasure tunnel lies buried

24:38.990 --> 24:43.540
somewhere below this is if it's just a

24:43.540 --> 24:44.940
little tough getting back in here right

24:44.940 --> 24:46.779
now we might have to cut down these

24:46.779 --> 24:50.480
trees yep could the Oak Island team

24:50.480 --> 24:52.619
really have found where an ancient

24:52.619 --> 24:56.450
treasure vault lies buried some 280 feet

24:56.450 --> 24:59.740
north of the money pit let's go talk to

24:59.740 --> 25:01.580
Rick let him know what what we found out

25:01.580 --> 25:03.590
here oh good great talk him into drill

25:03.590 --> 25:16.429
in here yeah that's a good idea

25:16.429 --> 25:20.360
let's get steel dawn halt figure this

25:20.360 --> 25:23.350
they all four days after Oak Island

25:23.350 --> 25:26.139
theorists Mike and Sean Harold pointed

25:26.139 --> 25:27.701
out the area where treasure hunter

25:27.701 --> 25:29.860
Laverne Johnson believed a treasure

25:29.860 --> 25:32.710
might be found Rick lagina and members

25:32.710 --> 25:35.100
of his team have brought in a coring rig

25:35.100 --> 25:37.789
they are hoping that by drilling a

25:37.789 --> 25:39.690
number of holes based on Johnson's

25:39.690 --> 25:42.549
precise calculations they will be able

25:42.549 --> 25:44.309
to confirm the presence of an

25:44.309 --> 25:46.809
underground cavern or possible treasure

25:46.809 --> 25:49.830
tunnel we came into it with the idea of

25:49.830 --> 25:52.499
drilling holes throughout the grid we've

25:52.499 --> 25:55.730
now drilled on the easterly side in the

25:55.730 --> 25:57.879
westerly side didn't find anything

25:57.879 --> 26:01.679
unfortunately it's only logical now to

26:01.679 --> 26:04.799
drill in the middle of the shaft right

26:04.799 --> 26:06.379
now okay at this point needs a lot of

26:06.379 --> 26:07.379
luck yep not a lot of luck but luck yeah

26:07.379 --> 26:12.240
be nice to get lucky today a tunnel a

26:12.240 --> 26:14.380
shaft the cavity is not gonna stand up

26:14.380 --> 26:16.820
without support ie wood so we're looking

26:16.820 --> 26:19.190
for wood to come up out of the returns

26:19.190 --> 26:32.510
what do you think it is well I say its

26:32.510 --> 26:34.660
own clothes to sleep for me but it's

26:34.660 --> 26:36.980
still not enough to say his bed drop no

26:36.980 --> 26:39.000
right this isn't the right deal so let's

26:39.000 --> 26:42.230
pull up then go to the other one after

26:42.230 --> 26:45.009
drilling down to a depth of 50 feet and

26:45.009 --> 26:48.149
only finding bedrock Rick lagina decides

26:48.149 --> 26:50.669
to move on to one of the other targets

26:50.669 --> 26:51.669
marked in the grid

26:51.669 --> 27:01.750
although Laverne Johnson only dug his

27:01.750 --> 27:04.539
would cribs searcher shaft down to 30

27:04.539 --> 27:07.149
feet he regretted not digging the shaft

27:07.149 --> 27:10.399
deeper he often wondered if by doing so

27:10.399 --> 27:12.700
he might have found the actual treasure

27:12.700 --> 27:14.473
vault he spent a good deal of his life

27:14.473 --> 27:15.473
looking

27:15.473 --> 27:16.980
I'm just ready to bring out the core now

27:16.980 --> 27:25.769
this is hole number three I hit

27:25.769 --> 27:27.029
something

27:27.029 --> 27:29.499
that was stopped ahead of the cage we're

27:29.499 --> 27:30.590
gonna come out

27:30.590 --> 27:32.889
stock we're stuck right here I hate

27:32.889 --> 27:37.879
restriction at about 31 feet where you

27:37.879 --> 27:42.270
know 30 was 35 would found at a depth of

27:42.270 --> 27:46.000
35 feet 5 feet deeper than the searcher

27:46.000 --> 27:49.820
shaft dug by Laverne Johnson in 1962

27:49.820 --> 27:53.620
Thorpe like that it could be in the side

27:53.620 --> 27:56.690
of the I think should be running like

27:56.690 --> 27:58.600
that if it's stock Timbers yeah but you

27:58.600 --> 28:00.529
cord like that that is straight up and

28:00.529 --> 28:01.529
down whatever is there

28:01.529 --> 28:04.769
I don't know that it means anything but

28:04.769 --> 28:08.350
this come up but it's only Greg hunka

28:08.350 --> 28:12.559
woods I know but this is below the

28:12.559 --> 28:13.559
cribbing

28:13.559 --> 28:14.880
35 feet

28:14.880 --> 28:21.100
okay well sue at Charleston this came up

28:21.100 --> 28:26.929
from 31 to 35 feet rank from the records

28:26.929 --> 28:34.649
what do you know about the deafness

28:34.649 --> 28:35.970
well Rick's from the records they dug

28:35.970 --> 28:37.489
this down to 30 feet your circle yes

28:37.489 --> 28:38.489
here's the weird thing

28:38.489 --> 28:39.489
the core came up like

28:39.489 --> 28:40.489
that's interesting

28:40.489 --> 28:41.489
there's no reason to have any wood

28:41.489 --> 28:42.929
standing on end just like we did in

28:42.929 --> 28:52.989
Valley 3 right on the edge right on the

28:52.989 --> 28:58.610
edge of it yeah in the money pit

28:58.610 --> 28:59.610
the side of the box then become

28:59.610 --> 29:00.610
and maybe me

29:00.610 --> 29:01.610
hit the side of

29:01.610 --> 29:02.610
last year while drilling in the money

29:02.610 --> 29:03.610
pit the team found evidence of a

29:03.610 --> 29:04.610
concrete covered wooden vault first

29:04.610 --> 29:06.710
reported by searchers in 1897

29:06.710 --> 29:11.669
concrete and then wood that's the

29:11.669 --> 29:13.519
description that's what they found in

29:13.519 --> 29:16.809
the top of the vault because most

29:16.809 --> 29:18.850
searcher tunnels are made up of wooden

29:18.850 --> 29:21.909
boards stacked horizontally finding a

29:21.909 --> 29:23.970
piece of wood with the grain running

29:23.970 --> 29:28.519
vertically might be significant it could

29:28.519 --> 29:30.840
mean that Rick and the team have found a

29:30.840 --> 29:33.480
structure similar to the one found last

29:33.480 --> 29:36.909
year can't walk away from this with that

29:36.909 --> 29:41.580
little clue I mean so I'm so tired of

29:41.580 --> 29:44.239
little clues but maybe we drill one and

29:44.239 --> 29:46.009
we get something more than a little clue

29:46.009 --> 29:48.539
yeah it's too enticing I think we want

29:48.539 --> 29:51.320
to drill another hole here if the next

29:51.320 --> 29:54.249
core sample turns up more wood and at an

29:54.249 --> 29:57.019
even lower depth then Rick lagina and

29:57.019 --> 29:59.279
his partners may have found evidence of

29:59.279 --> 30:02.909
a tunnel and possibly a treasure vault

30:02.909 --> 30:05.549
just a few yards north of the money pit

30:05.549 --> 30:08.160
exactly where Laverne Johnson predicted

30:08.160 --> 30:09.160
it would be

30:09.160 --> 30:15.559
let's see what howling things after we

30:15.559 --> 30:16.700
drive this car

30:16.700 --> 30:19.360
so as the steel hits the dirt I mean I'm

30:19.360 --> 30:20.360
hopeful whether we dig whether we drill

30:20.360 --> 30:22.289
whether we measure basically I guess I'm

30:22.289 --> 30:24.450
just hopeful

30:24.450 --> 30:32.369
that's 45 feet there

30:32.369 --> 30:42.559
no wood no nothing we're a lover bird

30:42.559 --> 30:43.559
beat Scrabble we're in a box or

30:43.559 --> 30:52.389
something this should have been a top of

30:52.389 --> 30:53.389
the bottom to it

30:53.389 --> 30:57.450
no boulders there no boulders but no

30:57.450 --> 30:58.450
wood either

30:58.450 --> 31:01.419
yeah the fact that no ward came out of

31:01.419 --> 31:03.369
the coring barrel offers both the

31:03.369 --> 31:06.090
surprise and a disappointment to Rick

31:06.090 --> 31:08.029
lagina and members of his team

31:08.029 --> 31:10.639
it appears the piece of wood they found

31:10.639 --> 31:14.250
was not part of a larger structure in

31:14.250 --> 31:16.510
other woods intriguing we'll grab a

31:16.510 --> 31:18.509
sample you rip the sample we'll send it

31:18.509 --> 31:20.720
off to get tested but I think for right

31:20.720 --> 31:23.150
now at least temporarily we need to step

31:23.150 --> 31:24.591
away from here because we need to do

31:24.591 --> 31:27.850
other things at this point in time yeah

31:27.850 --> 31:29.869
although today's drilling operation

31:29.869 --> 31:32.590
ended disappointingly Rick lagina and

31:32.590 --> 31:35.309
the Oak Island team are determined not

31:35.309 --> 31:38.160
to give up if anything it is only

31:38.160 --> 31:40.639
renewed their determination to focus

31:40.639 --> 31:42.590
their energy on getting to the bottom of

31:42.590 --> 31:45.539
10x as well as getting answers

31:45.539 --> 31:47.389
concerning the other evidence the team

31:47.389 --> 31:49.960
is gathered during the last several days

31:49.960 --> 31:54.470
we can't have three four and five things

31:54.470 --> 31:56.710
going on at once it just it's not

31:56.710 --> 31:58.780
practical so we need to focus on the

31:58.780 --> 32:01.269
agenda we laid out earlier in the summer

32:01.269 --> 32:03.090
we need to finish 10x we've got other

32:03.090 --> 32:04.769
things we need to work on as well and it

32:04.769 --> 32:06.989
you know you start to get unfocused if

32:06.989 --> 32:08.179
you have too many things going on

32:08.179 --> 32:09.179
thanks yep thank you all that for a

32:09.179 --> 32:11.820
little peace

32:11.820 --> 32:24.059
what if it's like 1625 you know English

32:24.059 --> 32:28.520
collectable replica I think that's

32:28.520 --> 32:31.710
important opinion it has now been a full

32:31.710 --> 32:34.539
week since Rick Marty and their partners

32:34.539 --> 32:36.899
submitted the mysterious Roman sword for

32:36.899 --> 32:39.580
testing and they are hoping that the

32:39.580 --> 32:41.940
scientific analysis conducted on the

32:41.940 --> 32:44.210
sword will lead to a breakthrough in

32:44.210 --> 32:46.409
solving the Oak Island mystery

32:46.409 --> 32:49.909
and we are here again yep here we are

32:49.909 --> 32:51.620
st. Mary's let's find out about that

32:51.620 --> 32:52.620
sword shall we

32:52.620 --> 32:56.019
they did a light reflection test which

32:56.019 --> 32:59.359
will help determine with his bronze or

32:59.359 --> 33:01.480
brass and then they're doing Raman

33:01.480 --> 33:03.470
spectroscopy examination on and that's

33:03.470 --> 33:05.039
the one that'll get down to the tiny

33:05.039 --> 33:07.100
little details of it it's kind of like a

33:07.100 --> 33:10.159
fingerprint it's got you know all the

33:10.159 --> 33:11.789
different elements what percent of each

33:11.789 --> 33:16.869
element whoa hi nice to meet you

33:16.869 --> 33:19.929
hi Marty dr. Krista Bruce oh he's an

33:19.929 --> 33:22.610
associate professor of chemistry at st.

33:22.610 --> 33:26.100
Mary's University in Halifax Nova Scotia

33:26.100 --> 33:28.059
she is considered one of the leading

33:28.059 --> 33:30.309
experts in the field of electrochemistry

33:30.309 --> 33:32.429
and the study of the chemical

33:32.429 --> 33:36.090
composition of metals welcome to st.

33:36.090 --> 33:37.090
Mary's

33:37.090 --> 33:38.090
there's our artifact there's your

33:38.090 --> 33:41.100
artifact so you left it with me yep

33:41.100 --> 33:45.539
and so we did I would made 1950 we did

33:45.539 --> 33:48.120
some tests I'm if it's a replica from a

33:48.120 --> 33:50.049
certain time period in British history

33:50.049 --> 33:51.820
say or French history that might mean

33:51.820 --> 33:54.270
something - okay so you know if it's a

33:54.270 --> 33:57.310
replica as David said made in 1950 well

33:57.310 --> 33:58.859
it doesn't mean too much I guess we can

33:58.859 --> 34:01.600
use it to open really big letters I

34:01.600 --> 34:03.019
think it has an interesting story to

34:03.019 --> 34:06.750
tell so okay so before we start if you

34:06.750 --> 34:09.880
can put the lab code okay you know we're

34:09.880 --> 34:11.409
optimists we're optimist aren't we often

34:11.409 --> 34:13.830
miss Rick we're optimist in general so

34:13.830 --> 34:15.918
we're hoping the sword might be a clue

34:15.918 --> 34:18.380
so when people are in dealing with it

34:18.380 --> 34:20.889
what is it a copper alloy artifact

34:20.889 --> 34:23.110
usually the first question they're

34:23.110 --> 34:25.610
interested in is this at bronze or is

34:25.610 --> 34:28.550
this brass right and so based on whether

34:28.550 --> 34:30.570
it's a bronze or brass is really helpful

34:30.570 --> 34:33.840
in terms of dating the object so what we

34:33.840 --> 34:36.340
did is on the back down here at the

34:36.340 --> 34:39.449
polished tip we removed some shavings

34:39.449 --> 34:42.570
filings of the base metal and that

34:42.570 --> 34:44.860
allows us to do basically look at that

34:44.860 --> 34:47.340
composition of the alloy we determined

34:47.340 --> 34:49.320
percent amount of each of the different

34:49.320 --> 34:51.980
metal components the base metal in this

34:51.980 --> 34:55.418
case is it's a compras ink alloy so that

34:55.418 --> 35:01.400
tells us right away that this is a brass

35:01.400 --> 35:02.900
and the higher doesn't content the more

35:02.900 --> 35:06.280
modern the brass so you know modern-day

35:06.280 --> 35:08.600
brass is you can get up 40 50 60 percent

35:08.600 --> 35:12.520
zinc what did you find out about it

35:12.520 --> 35:15.030
here's a percent composition of the main

35:15.030 --> 35:17.330
elemental components and so what you see

35:17.330 --> 35:20.490
is the zinc content is fairly high and

35:20.490 --> 35:23.160
so that suggests a modern brass yeah

35:23.160 --> 35:27.170
close to my 1950 I think you're looking

35:27.170 --> 35:32.360
at a post 1880 1890 date for this for

35:32.360 --> 35:36.640
sure she was basically putting pins and

35:36.640 --> 35:38.610
the balloon we had constructed for

35:38.610 --> 35:41.290
ourselves but at the end of the day dr.

35:41.290 --> 35:45.200
Bruce so I think we both can't do a

35:45.200 --> 35:47.120
understanding that it was not what we

35:47.120 --> 35:49.690
thought it would be or wanted it to be

35:49.690 --> 35:50.920
yeah I didn't really think they were

35:50.920 --> 35:52.670
little pins going into balloons I

35:52.670 --> 35:54.900
thought she was hitting each time with a

35:54.900 --> 35:59.720
bazooka this thing is dead it's

35:59.720 --> 36:01.390
certainly an interesting piece just not

36:01.390 --> 36:02.390
worth anything

36:02.390 --> 36:06.120
what depends who you ask great took a

36:06.120 --> 36:08.240
collector then might be a you know word

36:08.240 --> 36:10.430
productions look you did a great job

36:10.430 --> 36:18.410
Kristen we appreciate it and even though

36:18.410 --> 36:21.820
this is disappointing I mean it it also

36:21.820 --> 36:25.430
it eliminates you know one one idea so

36:25.430 --> 36:28.880
we can narrow in on what's truly pretty

36:28.880 --> 36:30.750
much puts it to bed you know so I think

36:30.750 --> 36:32.590
I think so many weird things that

36:32.590 --> 36:34.510
happened on Oak Island that that this

36:34.510 --> 36:35.990
would have just you know doubled the

36:35.990 --> 36:37.550
weirdness so that made us think it might

36:37.550 --> 36:40.330
be real because it just seems to happen

36:40.330 --> 36:42.910
there yeah okay great wonderful thank

36:42.910 --> 36:45.810
you very much

36:45.810 --> 36:49.110
as Rick Marty Craig and Dave leave the

36:49.110 --> 36:52.040
laboratory at st. Mary's University they

36:52.040 --> 36:54.010
are content to have received some

36:54.010 --> 36:55.070
definitive answers

36:55.070 --> 36:59.140
although the mysterious Roman sword

36:59.140 --> 37:01.120
discovered in the waters of the shores

37:01.120 --> 37:04.420
of Oak Island some 60 years ago turned

37:04.420 --> 37:06.800
out to be a replica and of recent origin

37:06.800 --> 37:07.800
the

37:07.800 --> 37:10.210
that only by testing and then

37:10.210 --> 37:13.040
eliminating theories no matter how wild

37:13.040 --> 37:15.400
or far-fetched they may seem will they

37:15.400 --> 37:17.630
be able to concentrate on evidence that

37:17.630 --> 37:20.460
refuses to be ruled out

37:20.460 --> 37:23.710
and one such piece of evidence involving

37:23.710 --> 37:25.710
the mysterious box drains at Smith's

37:25.710 --> 37:28.310
Cove is about to provide them with an

37:28.310 --> 37:30.810
answer that could put the entire Oak

37:30.810 --> 37:32.830
Island treasure hunting into sharper

37:32.830 --> 37:46.640
focus than ever before

37:46.640 --> 37:48.740
after a week that saw the testing of

37:48.740 --> 37:52.520
both new evidence and old theories Rick

37:52.520 --> 37:55.080
Marty Craig and members of their team

37:55.080 --> 37:57.630
gather in the war room to find out if

37:57.630 --> 37:59.940
the recent discovery of eelgrass made at

37:59.940 --> 38:02.580
Smith's Cove might finally produce some

38:02.580 --> 38:05.120
badly needed information in their quest

38:05.120 --> 38:07.760
to solve the Oak Island mystery well

38:07.760 --> 38:11.120
guys I got some data in from Smith's

38:11.120 --> 38:14.050
Cove I think it's pretty interesting

38:14.050 --> 38:16.810
results the eelgrass and this was the

38:16.810 --> 38:26.410
95% probability is from 1472 1650 and I

38:26.410 --> 38:27.990
think it ties into some of the people's

38:27.990 --> 38:29.090
theories that are around you know

38:29.090 --> 38:30.780
absolutely Craig there's a number of

38:30.780 --> 38:33.050
possibilities that fall under that time

38:33.050 --> 38:35.290
timeframe you think Templars could fit

38:35.290 --> 38:37.320
into that time frame this surely doesn't

38:37.320 --> 38:39.610
exclude them that's for sure this also

38:39.610 --> 38:42.180
ties into the you know more recent

38:42.180 --> 38:44.520
Portuguese possibility that we've heard

38:44.520 --> 38:48.220
him recently the late 1500s it's

38:48.220 --> 38:49.500
interesting that it comes around to the

38:49.500 --> 38:52.260
five credible theories one of which is

38:52.260 --> 38:55.030
Dan Spanish yeah Dan is always been a

38:55.030 --> 38:58.660
believer in 1550 right so that's a

38:58.660 --> 39:02.670
pretty intriguing piece of information

39:02.670 --> 39:04.730
because the eelgrass is probably not

39:04.730 --> 39:06.840
more than five hundred and forty-five

39:06.840 --> 39:10.050
years old it seems to challenge many of

39:10.050 --> 39:12.150
the more elaborate theories involving

39:12.150 --> 39:15.930
everyone from the ancient Romans to the

39:15.930 --> 39:20.980
Carthaginians and the Aztecs but it has

39:20.980 --> 39:23.840
also long been theorized that oak island

39:23.840 --> 39:26.310
serves as the hiding place not just for

39:26.310 --> 39:29.520
one treasure but several and at the

39:29.520 --> 39:31.460
ground far beneath the surface of the

39:31.460 --> 39:33.680
island is a maze of booby trapped

39:33.680 --> 39:35.350
tunnels and treasure chambers

39:35.350 --> 39:39.220
perhaps finding the eelgrass does not

39:39.220 --> 39:41.250
invalidate some of the more incredible

39:41.250 --> 39:45.120
theories so much as it helps to validate

39:45.120 --> 39:49.080
some of the more common ones

39:49.080 --> 39:50.570
what's that's great at least it sold its

39:50.570 --> 39:52.870
pre 1795 by a long shot

39:52.870 --> 39:55.490
I I see it as only a really big

39:55.490 --> 39:57.810
indication that people were here and did

39:57.810 --> 40:00.330
build Smith's Cove especially prior to

40:00.330 --> 40:02.150
the original finding of the money pit

40:02.150 --> 40:05.540
like this is good definitive proof who

40:05.540 --> 40:07.740
would have laid this down for no reason

40:07.740 --> 40:09.640
I agree

40:09.640 --> 40:12.820
no question well done jack you know it's

40:12.820 --> 40:14.980
important data and you were the bearer

40:14.980 --> 40:16.740
of it well done we appreciate it

40:16.740 --> 40:18.900
well thanks Peter and Dan helped a lot

40:18.900 --> 40:20.690
to the fellowship

40:20.690 --> 40:23.570
thanks you you're welcome absolutely

40:23.570 --> 40:25.810
another good piece of the puzzle that's

40:25.810 --> 40:30.330
what it was yep thusly energized we we

40:30.330 --> 40:33.640
go forth and conquer ready

40:33.640 --> 40:37.990
after a week of setbacks and dead ends

40:37.990 --> 40:40.840
brothers Rick and Marty lagina have

40:40.840 --> 40:42.900
finally gotten one of the most hopeful

40:42.900 --> 40:45.210
pieces of information they've received

40:45.210 --> 40:48.600
to date it validates many of the more

40:48.600 --> 40:51.140
persistent theories concerning Oak

40:51.140 --> 40:54.390
Island it also encourages them to stay

40:54.390 --> 40:56.610
positive and remain focused on their

40:56.610 --> 40:58.810
goal to reach the bottom of the money

40:58.810 --> 41:02.500
pit once and for all but how will they

41:02.500 --> 41:05.590
do it by draining the mysterious

41:05.590 --> 41:09.190
triangle-shaped swamp by digging an

41:09.190 --> 41:10.740
enormous hole

41:10.740 --> 41:13.320
won't they reach it by means of a

41:13.320 --> 41:16.080
man-made tunnel

41:16.080 --> 41:18.680
which reportedly lies 235 feet beneath

41:18.680 --> 41:21.830
the island surface

41:21.830 --> 41:25.880
of the dark and mysterious Warhol

41:25.880 --> 41:29.540
as 10x

41:29.540 --> 41:31.340
next time on the curse of Oak Island

41:31.340 --> 41:34.210
we're back from the money pit we hit a

41:34.210 --> 41:35.400
cabbage

41:35.400 --> 41:43.480
we put it fun it's a piece of metal any

41:43.480 --> 41:46.360
idea what it is it looks like a little

41:46.360 --> 41:48.420
tiny Oak Island John Chatterton is

41:48.420 --> 41:50.790
confident he's gonna go down to the

41:50.790 --> 41:52.310
bottom it's not if we can do it is how

41:52.410 --> 41:54.280
do we do are you at the bottom of

41:54.304 --> 41:56.304
