She finally gets it
on the ballot, and it tanked.

31:19.145 --> 31:21.047
So she becomes
the mad bomber?

31:21.113 --> 31:23.749
Well, the alt is,
her IP address was spoofed,

31:23.815 --> 31:26.118
"The Sentinel's" address
was planted in her apartment,

31:26.185 --> 31:28.087
meaning someone went through
a hell of a lot of trouble

31:28.154 --> 31:29.555
to try to convince us
of a story

31:29.621 --> 31:32.091
that on its face is absurd.

31:32.158 --> 31:33.825
Right, well,
I'll take a clue trail

31:33.892 --> 31:35.261
over a conspiracy any day.

31:35.327 --> 31:38.664
If this woman has lost it,
she's dangerous.

31:38.730 --> 31:39.898
Yeah, and still on the loose.

31:39.966 --> 31:41.467
Yeah. Kelly, talk to me.

31:41.533 --> 31:43.235
Yeah, we got a fix
on her car's GPS.

31:43.302 --> 31:44.403
Okay.

31:46.438 --> 31:48.407
She just turned off
Maiden Lane onto Water Street.

31:48.474 --> 31:49.942
Where the hell is she going?

31:51.777 --> 31:53.245
Ann just blew
through a traffic light.

31:53.312 --> 31:54.846
Okay, she's stopping at

31:54.913 --> 31:56.615
Fletcher and Water.
- What's there?

31:56.682 --> 31:57.984
That's Gotham Freedom Front.

31:58.050 --> 32:00.953
Try to reach
somebody over there.

32:01.020 --> 32:02.488

cams outside the building.

32:02.554 --> 32:04.656
Yep. Got it.

32:04.723 --> 32:06.425

from the parking garage.

Yup, there she is. Anything?

that Tasker lunatic

32:20.973 --> 32:23.075

32:23.142 --> 32:24.543
She's got a gun.

32:24.610 --> 32:25.844
Where is she now?

32:25.911 --> 32:27.146
Security tried to stop her,

32:27.213 --> 32:29.315
but she barricaded herself
in my office

32:29.381 --> 32:30.649
with my assistant, Susan.

32:33.352 --> 32:35.787
We have a hostage situation
at Fletcher and Water Street.

Mr. Bogdan,

32:45.264 --> 32:46.432

if you just sit this one out

32:46.498 --> 32:47.399
