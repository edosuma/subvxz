00:01.042 --> 00:02.252
(ON PHONE) <i>Guys, stop!</i>

00:03.294 --> 00:07.090
<i>Filthy! Stop recording.
We don't need this recorded.</i>

00:07.257 --> 00:10.010
<i>- Guys, stop, you don't need to do this.</i>
- When the full court presses on,

00:10.010 --> 00:11.845
you don't back down.
That's what I taught him.

00:12.053 --> 00:16.016
But at what cost? We've always taught
the boys to walk away from conflict.

00:16.516 --> 00:18.476
Now, the superintendent
is demanding a meeting.

00:18.476 --> 00:20.687
It didn't even happen on school grounds.

00:21.146 --> 00:24.441
Babe, these kids, they fight.
You know how many fights I got into?

00:24.441 --> 00:26.401
Yeah, but that was before social media,

00:26.401 --> 00:28.945
before the whole world
could watch and weigh in.

00:29.362 --> 00:33.366
Exactly. These kids,
they blowing it up online.

00:33.366 --> 00:35.660
It probably looks a lot worse
than it really was.

00:35.910 --> 00:38.079
Our son was wearing a Hughes hoodie.

00:38.455 --> 00:40.206
That makes him an ambassador
for the school.

00:40.206 --> 00:42.709
Not just a bad look for him,
for the entire district.

00:42.917 --> 00:45.295
All right, so, how much punishment
does he need?

00:46.337 --> 00:49.257
All right? We're Filthy's parents.
We're handling this thing at home.

00:49.257 --> 00:52.218
- This thing's probably gonna blow over.
- Well, I hope you're right.

00:52.927 --> 00:55.096
But I'm afraid that call
might be above my pay grade.

00:55.638 --> 00:58.558
- Filthy made a dumb mistake.
- That's the key word, hon.

00:59.350 --> 01:00.351
It's a mistake.

01:01.644 --> 01:04.314
We don't even know
what the superintendent wants yet.

01:04.314 --> 01:07.484
So, let's wait until after the meeting
and figure this thing out together.

01:08.109 --> 01:11.946
Well, at least Filthy and JB called
a truce for now.

01:12.238 --> 01:16.076
Well, I'll take it. I need them in sync
for this elimination game tonight.

01:21.039 --> 01:22.499
Any word from Kelli?

01:23.041 --> 01:24.417
Nothing.

01:24.542 --> 01:26.252
I mean, what do you expect, babe?

01:26.544 --> 01:30.715
Old man reaches out to her,
out of the blue... with no explanation.

01:30.840 --> 01:32.801
Stop. I will not let you do that.

01:32.926 --> 01:36.513
- You fought hard to get custody of her.
- Right. I fought and I lost.

01:36.513 --> 01:39.724
You never stopped trying.
All those letters, cards.

01:40.225 --> 01:43.520
I don't know what narrative she was fed,
but you never stopped trying.

01:49.234 --> 01:52.529
I haven't seen my daughter, babe,
for 17 years.

01:52.862 --> 01:55.532
She's her own woman.
She's her own person now.

01:55.865 --> 01:58.827
And it's like we are complete strangers,
you understand that?

01:58.952 --> 02:02.080
I do, but you are an amazing father
to our boys.

02:02.580 --> 02:04.332
And you would have been
the same to Kelli.

02:04.666 --> 02:06.417
Those circumstances were beyond you.

02:07.627 --> 02:13.216
Hey, look, I need you to focus on getting
a good report from that doctor today.

02:14.050 --> 02:16.219
Hmm?

02:17.303 --> 02:18.513
Can we pray on that?

02:27.355 --> 02:30.775
- You wanna pray about that game too?
- You can pray on that on your own time.

02:31.109 --> 02:32.110
Hmm.

02:45.415 --> 02:48.960
<i>"Phantasmal."
As in unreal, fictional.</i>

02:49.127 --> 02:52.046
<i>So cocky and caught up
in the fireworks of what's not there</i>

02:52.046 --> 02:54.883
<i>that you don't see
the smoke coming your way, fast.</i>

02:55.133 --> 02:56.259
Ayo, check this out.

02:56.509 --> 03:00.889
This one says, "Getting Filthy with it,
smacked them up clean

03:00.889 --> 03:04.976
-"and hashtag throws for bros."
- You're a freaking hero now.

03:05.101 --> 03:06.936
Yeah, I've always been a hero.

03:07.145 --> 03:10.190
I mean, who wouldn't stand up
for their pops and their bro? Come on now.

03:10.690 --> 03:14.402
Yo! My DMs are flooded
with Beacon baddies. This is crazy!

03:14.777 --> 03:17.572
High school girls. That's a level-up.

03:18.364 --> 03:20.200
- It's going down in the DMs, bro.

03:20.200 --> 03:22.076
Hey, I bet you Aniq is mad.

03:22.076 --> 03:25.663
Yo, he's gonna be even more mad
once I take this MVP from him next year.

03:25.663 --> 03:29.209
- Yo. You all seen Aniq's IG?
- No, why?

03:29.375 --> 03:31.544
Bro's at the doctor. He hurt his wrist.

03:31.544 --> 03:33.296
- Claims it happened at Roll Call.

03:34.505 --> 03:37.634
Oh, snap, he just posted an X-ray.

03:38.760 --> 03:41.763
I mean, that has nothing to do with me,
you know what I'm saying? I mean,

03:42.055 --> 03:43.640
it doesn't even look that bad.

03:43.640 --> 03:46.935
He's probably just playing it up to,
you know, get more Instagram followers.

03:46.935 --> 03:51.356
- Like who even posts injuries on IG?
- Someone who knows that everybody

03:51.356 --> 03:55.068
at Beacon including players and coaches
follows him and saw that video.

03:55.818 --> 03:56.861
Which means...

03:58.738 --> 03:59.864
Filthy's a dead man.

04:00.990 --> 04:02.408
Come on, guys, I can... what?

04:04.494 --> 04:08.414
I hope you understand. I'm not here
to make an example out of Josh.

04:09.290 --> 04:12.543
Thank you. His father and I have spoken
to him about his actions.

04:12.543 --> 04:15.880
I'm here to affirm
that showing favoritism is not an option.

04:16.172 --> 04:17.507
I never thought it was.

04:17.507 --> 04:19.509
When you were being considered
as principal,

04:19.634 --> 04:22.387
we were aware that your two boys
and your husband

04:22.512 --> 04:25.640
being a part of this school
could be a conflict of interest

04:25.640 --> 04:28.309
when it came to taking
tough disciplinary action.

04:28.518 --> 04:30.770
But because you work so well
with the students here,

04:31.354 --> 04:33.106
- we put our faith in you.
- And I appreciate that.

04:33.106 --> 04:35.400
Please do not make us regret our decision.

04:36.651 --> 04:38.695
I need this tabled by the end of the week.

04:39.779 --> 04:40.863
Wait, so tomorrow?

04:41.698 --> 04:42.865
Well, sometimes in this job,

04:42.865 --> 04:44.867
you have to make tough decisions
on short notice.

04:45.326 --> 04:47.829
I trust you'll do the right thing.
Have a good day.

04:54.877 --> 04:56.629
Oh, you two were in there
for way too long.

04:56.629 --> 04:59.132
That conversation
must have been intense. You good?

04:59.299 --> 05:03.386
As good as I'm gonna be,
and I'm dreading having to talk to him.

05:04.971 --> 05:06.264
He's always ready to gloat.

05:06.389 --> 05:09.642
That man needs to take all those diplomas
out of his butt. He ain't special.

05:11.227 --> 05:13.730
- He may be fine, but he is not special.
- Ew.

05:13.855 --> 05:18.026
(ON PHONE) <i>Guys, stop,
you don't need to do this. Stop! Filthy!</i>

05:18.192 --> 05:21.154
- Oh, my God. Filthy man, you are crazy.
<i>Guys, stop!</i>

05:21.529 --> 05:23.239
<i>Filthy--</i>

05:23.614 --> 05:25.074
I see that video
is getting a lot of attention.

05:25.241 --> 05:26.951
- And here we go.

05:27.243 --> 05:29.412
- Buckle up, he's just getting started.
- Mm.

05:33.166 --> 05:36.377
- So, what do you think?
- That this is not a good look for Hughes.

05:37.003 --> 05:41.758
That back when I was in those seats,
I was sweating, not smiling. I'm curious.

05:41.883 --> 05:43.384
What would you do
if this weren't your son?

05:47.096 --> 05:48.306
Listen, Crystal.

05:49.057 --> 05:52.894
My job as VP is to support you
and protect this school.

05:53.436 --> 05:55.772
But whether you like it or not,
all eyes are on you.

05:59.567 --> 06:00.651
Put your phone away.

06:05.698 --> 06:10.328
Excuse me.

06:12.246 --> 06:13.790
Don't say that.

06:19.921 --> 06:23.966
Yo... I'm glad we're us again.
You had me worried for a bit.

06:24.300 --> 06:27.929
And again, I'm really sorry.
But I missed you, Jordan Bell.

06:28.638 --> 06:30.139
She said the government name?

06:32.141 --> 06:35.645
I missed you, too. Yo, I even sent in
that application for City Arts.

06:35.645 --> 06:37.271
So, now you really stuck
with me next year.

06:41.317 --> 06:42.360
Uh.

06:43.277 --> 06:45.863
- JB, I got to tell you something.
- What's going on?

06:47.115 --> 06:50.701
The night of The Roll Call, my dad called,

06:50.701 --> 06:55.081
and he said I might be moving
back... to L.A. with him.

06:55.206 --> 06:56.249
Are you serious?

06:57.250 --> 07:00.128
- We just started talking again.
- And I didn't know how to tell you

07:00.128 --> 07:03.506
when I was just still trying to figure
everything out while also having fun.

07:06.217 --> 07:09.053
All right, well,
he said you might be moving back.

07:09.637 --> 07:12.014
So, until I see some suitcases...

07:14.642 --> 07:17.979
Yeah, you're right.
I guess I never thought of it like that.

07:29.866 --> 07:30.867
Coach Howard.

07:31.659 --> 07:34.162
-  Whoo!
- Hey.

07:34.328 --> 07:36.747
I never seen
Chuck "The Man" Bell out of breath.

07:36.873 --> 07:38.666
- Hey, I got your message.

07:38.666 --> 07:39.959
- Yeah.
- Is everything okay?

07:40.501 --> 07:42.420
Well, look, that's why I...

07:43.129 --> 07:45.465
...kind of wanna talk to you actually.

07:46.466 --> 07:51.471
Now, I know that you know, that Filthy
is possibly coming to Beacon next year.

07:52.096 --> 07:58.019
And after this Aniq incident,
I just thought I should check in.

07:58.144 --> 08:01.355
Yeah, well, Aniq's had his share
of incidents in the past,

08:01.355 --> 08:05.151
so, it wasn't entirely a surprise.
But he's got a good heart.

08:05.151 --> 08:06.736
Okay, well, so does Filthy.

08:07.737 --> 08:11.782
And, Coach, look, I know that this video,
it looks bad, but...

08:13.075 --> 08:14.410
I truly believe that...

08:15.870 --> 08:18.414
the situation just got out of hand
for both of them.

08:19.540 --> 08:20.791
- Mint?
- Nah, I'm okay.

08:21.959 --> 08:24.045
Chuck, so much of what we do here

08:24.045 --> 08:26.589
at Beacon goes beyond
the basketball court.

08:26.881 --> 08:29.884
I mean, our mission is to mold
these young men into fine citizens,

08:30.009 --> 08:31.260
build strong character,

08:31.594 --> 08:34.263
and help them become responsible
decision-makers in life.

08:34.388 --> 08:38.559
All right, listen, my boys,
they got discipline, all right?

08:38.684 --> 08:42.271
It was just a hand check.
It's not a flagrant.

08:42.271 --> 08:43.981
I hear you,

08:43.981 --> 08:46.734
but we want our Beacon boys to be able
to stand on their own two feet,

08:46.984 --> 08:48.027
well after Beacon.

08:49.403 --> 08:52.406
Well, my wife and I,
we share those same values.

08:52.532 --> 08:55.326
I tell my boys from day one,
it's about follow through.

08:55.326 --> 08:59.038
You finish what you start.
It's about being young men of integrity.

08:59.539 --> 09:02.333
And I assume that is the same thing
you will have here at Beacon.

09:02.833 --> 09:03.834
I do.

09:04.835 --> 09:09.423
'Cause, Coach, we all make mistakes.
Everybody needs a second chance.

09:13.135 --> 09:15.179
- Crazy.
- Hey, Filthy.

09:15.930 --> 09:18.975
- Hi.
- Yo! My followers have tripled

09:18.975 --> 09:21.394
- since that video dropped.
- Yeah? Okay.

09:21.727 --> 09:24.730
Your boy is totally fine.
The only medicine he's looking for

09:24.730 --> 09:26.983
- is attention.
- Exactly, that's what I'm saying.

09:27.900 --> 09:30.194
I don't know.
Something's not right though.

09:30.361 --> 09:32.822
- You haven't even gotten in trouble yet.
- Would you stop being so paranoid?

09:32.989 --> 09:34.490
Bask in the moment.

09:37.243 --> 09:39.870
What if you pull an Aniq,
and beat him at his own game?

09:40.204 --> 09:41.956
- What are you talking about?
- Get ahead of it.

09:42.164 --> 09:44.959
Make yourself a fan favorite
before the big game.

09:44.959 --> 09:48.129
- People love when you fall on the sword.
- Okay, I'm liking where this is going.

09:48.337 --> 09:51.549
Go live and give a sob story
on how sorry you are.

09:51.674 --> 09:54.677
Celebs do it all the time,
and people eat that garbage up.

09:54.844 --> 09:56.679
And maybe you won't have detention.

09:57.763 --> 09:59.348
You might be onto something.

10:02.143 --> 10:04.854
What's up, y'all? It's your boy,
Filthy McNasty here,

10:04.979 --> 10:06.647
about to drop some bars.

10:06.897 --> 10:11.527
I know you all wanna hear the flow.
Yo! What's up, Sierra? Sup, big Marv?

10:11.694 --> 10:14.655
What's up? Oh, Maya in here, too.
What's up, Maya?

10:14.822 --> 10:17.199
- Everybody in here. Got all my peeps.
- Hey, focus.

10:19.660 --> 10:21.787
I know most of you all have seen
the video of me and Aniq

10:21.787 --> 10:23.456
getting into it,
and I really wanna know.

10:23.456 --> 10:26.250
Was I in the wrong?
I... I mean, come on now.

10:27.585 --> 10:29.295
That's what I'm saying.
He was flapping his lips,

10:29.420 --> 10:32.089
and to be honest, I was just defending
my brother, you feel me?

10:32.089 --> 10:35.801
And who's gonna talk trash about my dad
and me not doing nothing about it?

10:35.801 --> 10:39.138
Basically, he was putting
a down payment on these hands.

10:39.305 --> 10:41.682
Hey, what happened to the apology?

10:41.932 --> 10:44.685
Forget about all that.
Look, it's like this.

10:45.019 --> 10:47.563
If you're coming for my fam,
then you're coming for me,

10:47.730 --> 10:51.984
and clearly, Filthy McNasty ain't lacking.
I'm in the cafeteria with it right now.

10:52.276 --> 10:54.153
Yo! Everybody say,
"What's up?" to the live.

10:54.153 --> 10:56.113
- Yo!

10:56.113 --> 10:57.406
- Yeah!
- Aye, as you can see,

10:57.406 --> 11:00.242
I'm here with it any day. Come on now.

11:00.409 --> 11:03.454
Yeah, all that! Look, look,
I'm on the table with it.

11:03.663 --> 11:07.124
What's up? The principal can't say nothing
about that! Come on now.

11:07.333 --> 11:09.251
And I'm going to yeet
on the court all of that.

11:10.753 --> 11:14.256
- Big game coming up, I hear.
- Nothing is more important than this.

11:14.382 --> 11:18.219
No, but we are one game away
from a championship, Doc. So, uh...

11:19.178 --> 11:21.514
some good news could go very far.

11:23.182 --> 11:27.186
I wish I had better news to give you,
Chuck, but it's getting worse.

11:28.187 --> 11:29.689
Your GFR is declining,

11:29.939 --> 11:32.775
which means that your kidneys
aren't functioning like they should.

11:33.234 --> 11:35.486
- Wait, how is that possible?
- I... I've been exercising.

11:35.486 --> 11:38.572
I've been eating right,
taking all my meds.

11:38.781 --> 11:41.325
Sure, your body is trying to get
all of this under control,

11:41.325 --> 11:43.577
but you may have
course corrected too late.

11:45.162 --> 11:48.124
So... so, are you saying
that I... I might need a transplant?

11:48.624 --> 11:52.545
I'm no longer saying you might need
a transplant. I'm saying you do.

11:52.712 --> 11:55.589
None of the relatives
that we tested are a match.

11:55.965 --> 11:58.467
Right. Which is why we need to get you
on the donor list ASAP.

12:04.181 --> 12:06.267
There is one more relative you could test.

12:07.017 --> 12:09.562
- See if she's a match.
- Excuse me?

12:11.230 --> 12:12.565
I have a daughter.

12:14.275 --> 12:15.276
Kelli.

12:15.526 --> 12:16.527
I didn't know.

12:17.236 --> 12:19.155
Yeah. She's nineteen.

12:21.198 --> 12:22.908
And we haven't spoken in a while.

12:23.117 --> 12:26.662
Chuck, it is vital that you explore
all options available.

12:32.877 --> 12:36.005
Ooh, ooh, ooh. All right, fellas!
We got one more job before the finals.

12:36.005 --> 12:39.049
So, I say we go out there
and show them who's boss!

12:39.049 --> 12:41.302
I say you stop talking
before you make Vondi more nervous.

12:41.302 --> 12:44.346
Shut up, man. I'm not nervous.
I'm just taking it all in.

12:44.555 --> 12:46.724
We're almost there. We almost got it.

12:46.932 --> 12:47.933
- Let's get it.
- Let's get it.

12:47.933 --> 12:49.518
- Let's go! Yeah!
Yeah!

12:49.518 --> 12:51.812
- Let's go!
Hey, lions on me! Lions on three!

12:51.812 --> 12:53.689
One, two, three, lions!

13:01.697 --> 13:03.199
<i>Boys on fire...</i>

13:04.575 --> 13:09.413
<i>With bolts of lightning on our kicks.
Gliding, flying, thriving.</i>

13:09.872 --> 13:13.793
<i>We were driving down the lane,
sliding into fame.</i>

13:13.918 --> 13:17.213
<i>Black eagles on the rise.
It's a bird, it's a plane.</i>

13:17.379 --> 13:18.672
<i>No, it's up, up,</i>

13:18.672 --> 13:20.883
<i>- us.</i>
Filthy! Filthy! Filthy! Filthy!

13:21.091 --> 13:23.511
- Yeah!

13:24.845 --> 13:29.391
- Come on, old boy! Come on!
- Let's go, let's go. Man, we did it.

13:29.517 --> 13:30.518
That's what we do.

13:30.810 --> 13:31.811
<i>Yeah!</i>

13:31.936 --> 13:33.229
We going to the finals, baby.

13:33.229 --> 13:34.855
<i>We were unstoppable.</i>

13:35.773 --> 13:36.774
<i>Or so we thought.</i>

13:51.622 --> 13:52.706
Can I help you?

13:52.832 --> 13:55.960
I'm Violet, Aniq Hale's mother.
I'm here to speak with Principal Bell.

13:56.252 --> 13:58.087
That would be me. Please come in.

13:59.380 --> 14:01.131
- Take a seat.
- I'll stand.

14:01.549 --> 14:03.008
I think you know what this is about.

14:03.008 --> 14:06.470
Well, first, let me offer my apologies.
Now, I think both of the boys

14:06.595 --> 14:08.430
let their emotions
get the best of them that night.

14:08.430 --> 14:11.016
I'm glad your son got to play tonight
because mine didn't.

14:11.141 --> 14:12.852
His doctor says he's dealing
with a fracture,

14:12.852 --> 14:14.478
that could potentially need surgery.

14:14.937 --> 14:17.189
- I'm sorry.
- We had D1 colleges scouting him

14:17.356 --> 14:19.400
as a sophomore.
Do you understand what that means?

14:19.900 --> 14:22.611
- I do. And Mrs. Hale...
- Your son has no regret

14:22.736 --> 14:23.946
for what happened at The Roll Call.

14:24.113 --> 14:25.322
Too busy putting on a show

14:25.447 --> 14:27.908
for the internet,
bragging about beating my son up.

14:28.576 --> 14:30.160
Every penny that I've earned

14:30.286 --> 14:32.705
has gone towards making my son's
basketball career,

14:32.705 --> 14:34.999
and now this injury is threatening
to take it all away.

14:34.999 --> 14:37.501
Violet, I understand
where you're coming from. I do.

14:38.043 --> 14:40.462
But I assure you,
we are taking this very seriously.

14:40.629 --> 14:42.172
Are you?

14:42.548 --> 14:44.717
Because from what I heard,
your husband ran to Coach Howard

14:44.717 --> 14:47.970
to do damage control so that your boys
could still get into Beacon next year.

14:48.304 --> 14:50.347
It must be nice for Josh
to be so protected

14:50.347 --> 14:52.099
because his mother is the principal

14:52.391 --> 14:54.894
and not holding him accountable
for his actions.

14:55.895 --> 14:57.688
Not everyone has that privilege.

15:04.778 --> 15:06.989
- JB has the ball.

15:07.156 --> 15:10.910
Passes it to Phil, Phil takes it.
Oh, crosses.

15:11.911 --> 15:13.746
Ah! A no-look pass.

15:14.580 --> 15:16.040
- Bucket!
- Swish!

15:16.040 --> 15:18.417
Yeah, yeah.

15:18.584 --> 15:21.003
- Yeah!
- Oh! Oh! You all killed it on the court.

15:21.003 --> 15:22.504
- Yeah!
- Unstoppable.

15:22.504 --> 15:26.300
Indeed, they are.
Congratulations, way to represent.

15:26.300 --> 15:29.511
- Yeah, we going to the championships!
Yeah, baby!

15:32.056 --> 15:35.851
I don't know how to say this,
so, I just am. Filthy, you're suspended.

15:36.185 --> 15:38.020
- From... from school?
- From the team.

15:38.020 --> 15:39.146
- What?
- What?

15:39.146 --> 15:40.898
Crystal, we said that
we would talk about this.

15:40.898 --> 15:43.567
Chuck, you deliberately went to speak
to Coach Howard behind my back.

15:43.567 --> 15:44.860
We didn't talk about that either.

15:45.861 --> 15:50.240
This is my school where we do not put
basketball over student safety.

15:50.366 --> 15:54.078
Okay, hold on. These are our boys.
You know how high the stakes are?

15:54.078 --> 15:56.080
We clenched a spot
at the city championships.

15:56.246 --> 15:57.206
Filthy will not be playing

15:57.206 --> 15:58.582
- in the city championships.
- Mom, what?

15:58.582 --> 16:01.168
The decision was made
on behalf of the school and district.

16:01.168 --> 16:04.004
- Mom, you can't do this.
- It is not up for discussion.

16:04.129 --> 16:07.257
- Yo, Mom!
- Aye! Don't make me pull you off, too.

16:16.475 --> 16:17.601
<i>"Bane."</i>

16:18.519 --> 16:19.937
<i>-As in ruin.</i>

16:21.063 --> 16:22.314
<i>As in destruction.</i>

16:23.524 --> 16:25.234
<i>As in the heart can only be broken</i>

16:25.234 --> 16:28.654
<i>so many times, before it shatters
into a million pieces.</i>

16:34.702 --> 16:36.704
Can't imagine
you're not playing in the game.

16:38.497 --> 16:40.124
I waited my entire life for this game.

16:40.624 --> 16:44.211
Coach Howard isn't about to come
just to watch me sit on the bench.

16:45.129 --> 16:46.422
I'm playing in that game.

16:47.464 --> 16:48.632
I know Dad has my back.

16:50.759 --> 16:53.178
Remember that sixth-grade basketball game?

16:53.470 --> 16:57.182
How could I forget? Zuma busted his nose.
There was blood everywhere.

16:57.182 --> 17:00.394
Yeah. I remember begging
my mom to take me

17:00.394 --> 17:02.396
even though I knew,
she wasn't feeling up to it.

17:02.688 --> 17:04.815
I kept telling her
about how good you were

17:05.107 --> 17:07.401
until I dragged her
out of the bed in her pajamas.

17:07.901 --> 17:09.945
Right, but we lost that game.

17:10.112 --> 17:13.323
And you told me it didn't matter
how many games you lost.

17:13.699 --> 17:16.702
It wasn't about winning.
It was about having the courage

17:16.827 --> 17:17.828
to show up.

17:19.830 --> 17:20.831
You remember all that?

17:20.831 --> 17:23.542
How could I forget?
You were rocking the crazy tall box...

17:23.542 --> 17:26.086
-  I did do that.
- ...trying to bring back the '90s.

17:26.086 --> 17:28.297
Which was way before we were even born.

17:31.050 --> 17:32.051
Man.

17:32.843 --> 17:35.471
My mom was so mad
I made her come to that game.

17:39.183 --> 17:40.392
Can't imagine how hard

17:40.392 --> 17:42.144
these past couple of months
have been for you.

17:42.936 --> 17:45.314
Yeah, some days are worse than others.

17:45.564 --> 17:47.441
Just been going through so much, I just...

17:48.650 --> 17:50.110
wish I had showed up more for you.

17:51.445 --> 17:54.615
Well, you're showing up now,
and talking about it helps.

17:54.990 --> 17:57.117
One thing about you, Maya,
you always kept it real.

17:57.117 --> 18:00.162
- That's the only way to live, okay?
- Right, right, right.

18:00.704 --> 18:04.083
Aye, now, I need you to use
that same courage.

18:04.666 --> 18:08.003
Go out to that game and show up.
Just like you did in sixth grade.

18:08.170 --> 18:11.715
And no matter what happens,
I believe in you, Filthy.

18:13.509 --> 18:15.177
- Oh, I'm going to show up.
- Oh.

18:15.385 --> 18:16.386
And I'mma...

18:17.012 --> 18:18.097
- Oh.

18:18.263 --> 18:19.890
- And I'mma show out!
- Let's go!

18:19.890 --> 18:22.017
And the crowd goes wild.

18:22.142 --> 18:24.478
- Oh... oh, my God! Filthy!

18:24.478 --> 18:25.646
Oh, okay!

18:25.771 --> 18:28.273
<i>When the game
is on the line, you got to grab the ball,</i>

18:28.524 --> 18:31.652
<i>survey the court,
and focus on what matters most.</i>

18:32.444 --> 18:34.988
<i>Pretty much everything else
is insignificant.</i>

18:36.115 --> 18:37.741
So, how's Filthy doing?

18:37.741 --> 18:42.162
He's dealing the way Filthy does.
Hoping my mom will change her mind.

18:42.830 --> 18:45.207
<i>I can't imagine him not playing
in the championship game.</i>

18:45.374 --> 18:48.627
JB, you're forgetting there are four
other players out there on the court

18:48.627 --> 18:52.005
- that will make up a team. You got this.
- I know, but...

18:52.881 --> 18:56.510
it's always been us on the court.
When we play together, we're unflappable.

18:56.927 --> 18:58.554
<i>Now, you sound like Filthy.</i>

18:59.721 --> 19:03.517
You just got to learn to adjust,
and quick. But you'll be okay.

19:05.185 --> 19:06.979
- You think?
<i>- Doesn't your dad say,</i>

19:06.979 --> 19:08.689
<i>"Shoot with your heart
and you'll never miss"?</i>

19:08.689 --> 19:10.232
Something like that.

19:11.275 --> 19:15.028
Right now, though, my heart's telling me
it doesn't want you to move to L.A.

19:17.656 --> 19:20.993
Well, one thing I can promise you
is that I will be the loudest one

19:21.243 --> 19:26.790
<i>in those stands. "Whoo! JB! JB! Whoo!"</i>

19:33.005 --> 19:34.214
You know, babe...

19:34.798 --> 19:36.466
What?

19:37.259 --> 19:40.429
I've looked over these games
a million times for inspiration.

19:40.637 --> 19:43.348
Ain't nobody going to be able to learn
these plays in such short notice.

19:43.348 --> 19:46.435
city champs is going to be damn near
impossible without him.

19:46.643 --> 19:48.395
Why you say it like it's my fault?

19:52.774 --> 19:56.153
Okay, fine. Let's say I lift
the suspension and he plays.

19:56.153 --> 19:58.113
The district will see me
playing favorites.

19:58.238 --> 20:00.032
My job and your coaching status
is now in question.

20:00.324 --> 20:04.036
No, babe, they will not, okay?
Filthy, he made a mistake.

20:04.161 --> 20:06.538
- That boy is sorry.
- Is he?

20:12.461 --> 20:14.671
<i>And you're not about to talk trash
about my pops...</i>

20:14.671 --> 20:16.632
Does that look like he's sorry to you?

20:16.632 --> 20:19.384
<i>He was basically putting
a down payment on these hands.</i>

20:19.885 --> 20:22.387
Filthy thinks that consequences
don't apply to him.

20:23.639 --> 20:25.641
Which we both know is not true.

20:26.350 --> 20:29.770
If you think my integrity as a principal
and your job as coach

20:29.770 --> 20:33.690
is worth a championship game,
then I'll lift the suspension.

20:40.489 --> 20:41.531
All right.

20:42.324 --> 20:44.910
He got caught up in the hype,
and his ego stepped in.

20:45.160 --> 20:46.245
And look, I get it.

20:47.663 --> 20:50.791
Not being in control
of your son's consequences is scary,

20:51.041 --> 20:53.752
but it's better that he misses
the championship game now

20:54.044 --> 20:56.421
than face far worse
repercussions later in life...

20:57.506 --> 20:59.049
when the game gets real.

21:10.477 --> 21:12.771
Dad. Hey, did you talk to Mom yet?

21:12.980 --> 21:16.066
I was thinking about changing the plays,
you know, trying to open up

21:16.191 --> 21:19.027
- JB's defense on the perimeter.
- Klay Thompson.

21:20.237 --> 21:21.780
Lance Stephenson.

21:23.282 --> 21:24.783
Fans there on the bleachers.

21:25.409 --> 21:27.577
Now, they've all trashed-talked LeBron.

21:28.245 --> 21:29.413
And how does he respond?

21:30.163 --> 21:35.127
By putting the points on the board
and winning the championship games.

21:35.294 --> 21:37.254
Which is exactly what I'm gonna do.

21:37.421 --> 21:39.673
Not if you can't get that ego in check.

21:39.881 --> 21:42.342
And I'm not just talking
about basketball, son.

21:42.509 --> 21:44.511
I'm talking about who you are as a person.

21:44.511 --> 21:47.848
That kid that was on that Instagram live?
I don't know who that kid was.

21:47.848 --> 21:50.225
That is not the Filthy McNasty
that I raised.

21:50.225 --> 21:53.395
- Dad, you don't get it.
- Oh, yes, I do. I've been there, son.

21:53.645 --> 21:58.900
And I also know that this game?
That comes with trash talk, okay?

21:59.067 --> 22:00.736
On and off the court.

22:01.945 --> 22:03.322
Now, there's gonna be other chances.

22:03.322 --> 22:06.199
- What do you mean other chances?
- If you don't grow tougher skin,

22:06.575 --> 22:09.911
if you don't keep a cool head,
keep that ego in check,

22:09.911 --> 22:13.582
you gonna lose more than just this game.
You're gonna lose yourself.

22:16.501 --> 22:20.922
Son, this is about the choice
you make at crunch time.

22:20.922 --> 22:26.553
This is about how you carry yourself,
especially when every move that you make

22:26.553 --> 22:31.058
is going to be recorded
and live rent-free on the internet?

22:32.225 --> 22:33.310
Son...

22:35.395 --> 22:37.356
Look, the decision has been made.

22:42.611 --> 22:43.862
Your suspension is final.

22:44.905 --> 22:49.242
Dad! Dad! Hey, hey, hey, hey!
I... I wasn't trying to start that fight.

22:49.242 --> 22:50.994
I... I was trying to protect you.

22:52.412 --> 22:55.457
I couldn't let anyone talk trash
about you, especially knowing

22:55.624 --> 22:59.294
- that you're sick.
- Don't worry about me, okay? I'm good.

22:59.294 --> 23:01.671
- I just wanted to make you proud.

23:02.923 --> 23:05.509
Oh, man.

23:07.302 --> 23:09.221
- Hold on, give me a minute.
- Dad?

23:09.888 --> 23:13.266
- Dad. What's going on? Hey! Dad! Dad? Hey!

23:13.934 --> 23:16.269
Dad. Come on. Dad? Someone help!

23:17.062 --> 23:20.607
Help! Some... someone help me!
Yo, Dad. Help!

23:21.358 --> 23:22.359
Help!

23:36.581 --> 23:40.335
<i>Chuck "The Man" Bell
once made 50 free throws in a row.</i>

23:40.877 --> 23:45.340
<i>It was like the orange orb had wings,
like an angel was taking it to the hoop.</i>

23:46.591 --> 23:48.343
<i>But no matter
how many times you make it...</i>

23:49.511 --> 23:51.263
<i>...eventually, you're going to miss one.</i>

23:52.806 --> 23:54.391
<i>How you handle what comes after...</i>

23:55.642 --> 23:56.643
Hello?

23:58.353 --> 23:59.688
<i>...that's what life is about.</i>

23:59.688 --> 24:01.398
What do you mean there's been an accident?

24:05.277 --> 24:06.319
<i>Choices.</i>
