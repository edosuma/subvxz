<i>on</i> The Girl from Plainville...

00:04.296 --> 00:05.923
Michelle Carter texts
<i>her friends for three days,</i>

00:05.923 --> 00:07.966
<i>telling them her boyfriend's</i>
<i>missing, maybe dead.</i>

00:07.966 --> 00:10.344
She was in contact with him
the whole time.

00:10.344 --> 00:12.387
- You she knew
he was gonna kill himself?

00:12.387 --> 00:14.014
- She was telling him to do it.

00:14.014 --> 00:16.266
- Why? Why did she lie
to her friends

00:16.266 --> 00:18.519
about not knowing
where Conrad was?

00:18.519 --> 00:20.145
To Natalie something.

00:20.145 --> 00:21.897
She told him to get back
in the truck.

00:21.897 --> 00:23.941
It is practically
a goddamn confession.

00:23.941 --> 00:26.026
- I don't know why I said that.

00:27.569 --> 00:29.321
It's your responsibility
<i>to set a good example.</i>

00:29.321 --> 00:32.157
- You're right. I get it.
- Pinkie swear?

00:34.409 --> 00:35.786
So that's the main couple.

00:35.786 --> 00:37.079
Rachel and Finn.

00:37.079 --> 00:38.539
Are those two together?

00:38.539 --> 00:40.165

<i>They start off as friends,</i>

00:40.165 --> 00:42.125
<i>and then they eventually</i>
<i>get together.</i>

00:42.125 --> 00:44.461
- I love you.

00:46.797 --> 00:49.091
I think we've got
<i>a manslaughter charge here.</i>

00:49.091 --> 00:51.343
- This kid has a history
of depression.

01:40.934 --> 01:44.771
- Mom, I just did
something stupid.

01:46.273 --> 01:49.526
I-I want her to come back.
I'm scared.

02:50.879 --> 02:52.130
- Why?

02:54.049 --> 02:57.135
- I-I-I don't know.

03:03.517 --> 03:05.227
- You scared me.

03:12.651 --> 03:14.861
If you die, I die.

03:20.033 --> 03:23.870
- I-I won't do it again.
I'm so sorry.

03:27.249 --> 03:30.085
I promise. I do.

03:45.559 --> 03:47.436
- The hospital
wants to commit him.

03:50.730 --> 03:52.858
- To a mental institution?

03:54.651 --> 03:57.654
- It's not up to us.
Doctor said.

03:59.698 --> 04:02.200
And when he gets out,

04:02.200 --> 04:04.286
we need to get him help.

04:04.286 --> 04:05.412
Therapy.

04:05.412 --> 04:06.913
- He needs
to get back to school.

04:08.582 --> 04:09.666
Back to work.

04:09.666 --> 04:11.543
- I'm not asking you.
I'm telling you.

04:15.422 --> 04:17.299
I need you with me on this.

04:19.426 --> 04:21.428
What was Conrad's
<i>state of mind</i>

04:21.428 --> 04:23.346
leading up to his passing?

04:24.973 --> 04:27.517
- He had his ups and downs.

04:27.517 --> 04:30.604
But he was doing better.

04:30.604 --> 04:32.939
Much better.

04:32.939 --> 04:34.733
So we thought.

04:34.733 --> 04:38.028
- Any trouble at home
stemming from the divorce

04:38.028 --> 04:39.905
that might have affected Conrad
emotionally?

04:39.905 --> 04:42.574
- It's not like
he threw us a party.

04:42.574 --> 04:45.285
Nobody's happy about divorce,
even if it's the right thing.

04:46.578 --> 04:47.954
- He left us all notes.

04:47.954 --> 04:50.332
I-I really don't know
what else there is to know.

04:52.834 --> 04:54.628
- Are either of you familiar
with a girl

04:54.628 --> 04:56.379
named Michelle Carter?

04:57.297 --> 04:58.840
- Yeah, of course.

04:58.840 --> 05:02.886
- And, um, what the nature of
her and Conrad's relationship?

05:02.886 --> 05:05.514
- Apparently,
they were boyfriend-girlfriend.

05:05.514 --> 05:08.183
But we didn't find out
about that until after.

05:08.183 --> 05:10.143
And, uh, have you been
in communication with her

05:10.143 --> 05:11.978
since Conrad passed?

05:11.978 --> 05:13.188
- Yeah, a little.

05:13.188 --> 05:14.689
Why do you ask about her?

05:14.689 --> 05:16.358
- We're just trying to piece
together what Conrad's life--

05:16.358 --> 05:17.567
- Coco.

05:18.985 --> 05:20.111
- I'm sorry?

05:20.111 --> 05:24.074
- You keep saying Conrad.
His name is Coco.

05:24.074 --> 05:26.368
- Of course, apologies.

05:28.161 --> 05:31.039
- Anything else
about Coco's homelife

05:31.039 --> 05:33.041
that might
help us piece together

05:33.041 --> 05:35.836
why he may have taken
his life?

05:35.836 --> 05:37.087
- No.

05:40.507 --> 05:42.217
The guys tell me
you go to King Philip.

05:44.803 --> 05:46.513
I-I-I went to Franklin.

05:47.597 --> 05:49.558
Captain of the football team.

05:49.558 --> 05:52.352
Hated playing you guys.

05:52.352 --> 05:56.273
Michelle, Mr. Cataldo
is speaking to you.

06:02.654 --> 06:04.865
- Uh, y-you're
probably wondering

06:04.865 --> 06:08.243
why the cops took away
your phone and your computer.

06:09.536 --> 06:11.538
I spoke to some contacts
at the DA,

06:11.538 --> 06:13.915
and they've opened
an official investigation

06:13.915 --> 06:17.002
into your connection
with the death of Conrad Roy.

06:19.004 --> 06:20.922
- Why?
- I'm still looking into it.

06:20.922 --> 06:23.717
But, um, the ADA that they've
got working the case,

06:23.717 --> 06:25.093
Katie Rayburn, she's tough.

06:25.093 --> 06:26.928
And she's not gonna
bring charges unless she's got

06:26.928 --> 06:28.305
something solid enough
for an indictment.

06:28.305 --> 06:29.681
- What do you mean?

06:29.681 --> 06:31.016
What is he talking about?

06:31.016 --> 06:33.727
- Um, let's just, um,
listen to him, Michelle.

06:33.727 --> 06:35.353
I'm sure he'll tell us.

06:35.353 --> 06:37.939
It--it means
I-I wouldn't be surprised

06:37.939 --> 06:39.774
if they bring charges.

06:39.774 --> 06:40.942
- What?

06:40.942 --> 06:42.402
But--but, listen to me.

06:42.402 --> 06:43.862
- But I didn't do
anything wrong.

06:43.862 --> 06:47.324
- I know, and it's my job
to get those charges dismissed.

06:47.324 --> 06:49.492
What I see here is fairly
open-and-shut.

06:49.492 --> 06:52.454
The young man,
he took his own life.

06:52.454 --> 06:54.706
Now, suicide
and even assisted suicide,

06:54.706 --> 06:57.083
it's not illegal
in the state of Massachusetts.

06:57.083 --> 06:58.251
So we've got that on our side.

06:58.251 --> 07:00.879
Do you, um--
do you watch football?

07:05.884 --> 07:07.927
'Cause I-I represented
some of the Patriots.

07:09.512 --> 07:11.848
Yeah,
so I'm gonna take care of you

07:11.848 --> 07:13.475
just as good
as I took care of them.

07:14.684 --> 07:15.727
Michelle, we've got
something called

07:15.727 --> 07:16.728
attorney-client privilege.

07:16.728 --> 07:18.563
Do you know what that is?

07:18.563 --> 07:20.690
Good, so if there's anything
that you wanna tell me

07:20.690 --> 07:23.026
that maybe you don't want
your mom or dad to hear,

07:23.026 --> 07:24.027
that's fine.

07:24.027 --> 07:25.195
We can ask them to leave.

07:27.489 --> 07:28.907
- I don't have anything
to tell you

07:28.907 --> 07:30.408
because I didn't
do anything wrong.

07:30.408 --> 07:31.701
- Okay.
- Really, I think this

07:31.701 --> 07:33.036
is just a big misunderstanding.

07:33.036 --> 07:34.746
You know,
I'm sure it is.

07:34.746 --> 07:37.040
- Can I just get a new phone?

07:37.040 --> 07:39.292
I can just text Lynn
and explain everything--

07:39.292 --> 07:40.835
- No, no, no, no,
under no circumstances

07:40.835 --> 07:42.087
are you to talk to Lynn Roy.

07:42.087 --> 07:44.547
We don't need to
complicate things any further.

07:44.547 --> 07:46.758
In fact, I don't want you
contacting anyone

07:46.758 --> 07:49.052
that has anything to do
with this case.

07:49.052 --> 07:50.512
You hear me?

07:50.512 --> 07:55.016
Stay off of everything--
phones, computers, everything.

07:55.016 --> 07:56.685
- What am I supposed to do?

07:59.521 --> 08:01.690
- Uh, r-read a book.

08:57.579 --> 08:59.622


09:39.954 --> 09:42.207
Hey. Here, give it to me.

09:56.596 --> 09:58.056
So?

10:00.016 --> 10:02.685
- My roommate trimmed
his toenails with his teeth.

10:04.020 --> 10:05.980
- Oh, so you fit right in.

10:12.821 --> 10:14.489
Do a lot of talking in there?

10:16.658 --> 10:18.952
- All I did was talk.

10:18.952 --> 10:21.538
You feel better, though,
yeah?

10:21.538 --> 10:22.831
- Yeah.

10:24.165 --> 10:26.292
- So maybe you keep it up.

10:28.169 --> 10:30.004
- What?
- Talking.

10:31.965 --> 10:34.467
To a therapist or...

10:34.467 --> 10:36.219
you know, whatever.

10:37.846 --> 10:39.222
- I'm good.

10:41.474 --> 10:43.893
- Maybe...

10:43.893 --> 10:45.645
there's no harm in trying it.

10:46.729 --> 10:48.940
Yeah? For a little bit?

10:50.441 --> 10:52.068
Mean a lot to your mom.

10:57.365 --> 10:58.449
- What about you?

11:01.494 --> 11:03.580
- Like I said,
mean a lot to your mom.

11:11.588 --> 11:14.048
- I told her
I'd never do it again.

11:14.048 --> 11:15.758
And I meant it.

11:20.805 --> 11:22.348
- I missed your laugh.

11:34.569 --> 11:35.862
- You're back.

11:46.831 --> 11:48.124
- I'm fine.

11:50.710 --> 11:52.587
Dad'll tell you
about my roommate's toenails.

11:52.587 --> 11:54.964
- Okay.

11:56.507 --> 11:58.468
What do you want for dinner?

11:58.468 --> 12:01.971
- Um, anything,
long as it's not on a tray.

12:01.971 --> 12:03.431
- I can manage that.

12:06.684 --> 12:11.105
- I'm gonna go, uh,
throw my stuff down.

12:11.105 --> 12:12.982
- Okay. Welcome home.

12:16.861 --> 12:19.155
I talked to him.

12:19.155 --> 12:23.368
He says he doesn't wanna keep
going to therapy.

12:23.368 --> 12:25.662
He said he would tell me
if he needed it.

12:25.662 --> 12:27.705
- I'm sure you presented
the idea with great enthusiasm.

12:27.705 --> 12:29.707
- Lynn, I fucking asked him.

12:29.707 --> 12:31.459
I asked you to do one thing!

12:31.459 --> 12:33.753
And I asked him, all right?

12:33.753 --> 12:35.338
He said no.

12:35.338 --> 12:37.090
I don't know what else
you want me to do here.

12:37.090 --> 12:39.175
I asked you
to do one thing.

12:39.175 --> 12:41.010
I'm out of here.

12:46.057 --> 12:47.976


12:49.435 --> 12:51.020
- Hey.

12:51.020 --> 12:52.647
Hey.

12:55.817 --> 12:58.069
- Would you please not be weird
around me too?

12:58.069 --> 12:59.654


13:01.698 --> 13:03.241
- If I tell you Jay Cole sucks,

13:03.241 --> 13:04.534
are you gonna try to do it
again?

13:11.416 --> 13:13.376


13:34.355 --> 13:35.356
Do you even care about

13:35.356 --> 13:37.150
what's been happening to me?

13:37.150 --> 13:38.985
- What's been happening to you?

13:38.985 --> 13:40.903
- Uh, I was in the hospital
for two weeks.

13:42.113 --> 13:43.489
- Why?

13:43.489 --> 13:46.451
- Because I'm weak
and I'm sensitive

13:46.451 --> 13:48.953
and I'm not even sure why you
like me in the first place.

13:50.872 --> 13:53.499
- Was it like therapy?
- I tried to kill myself.

13:57.795 --> 13:59.297
- I'm so sorry.

14:01.382 --> 14:03.217
- I'm not the person
you thought I was.

14:04.552 --> 14:05.845
- I should have been there
for you.

14:07.889 --> 14:09.599
- I just have a messed-up head.

14:12.310 --> 14:13.811
- No, you don't.

14:15.313 --> 14:16.606
I get it.

14:17.940 --> 14:19.609
And I'm here for you.

14:22.445 --> 14:23.780
I love you.

14:31.746 --> 14:35.166
Say we put
Coco's parents on the stand,

14:35.166 --> 14:38.461
have them tell the jury
what a good kid he was,

14:38.461 --> 14:40.838
how he worked
for the family business,

14:40.838 --> 14:43.216
got his captain's license,

14:43.216 --> 14:45.301
scholarship to Fitchburg State.

14:46.552 --> 14:49.680
Make the jury understand
he was just a normal kid

14:49.680 --> 14:51.682
until he meets Michelle Carter.

14:52.809 --> 14:53.810
Sure.

14:55.144 --> 14:57.605
- What?
- Feels thin.

14:57.605 --> 14:59.649
- Ugh, feels like it's begging
to be blown up.

14:59.649 --> 15:00.942
Um...
Mm-hmm.

15:00.942 --> 15:02.568
- Let's get an investigator
on the Roys.

15:02.568 --> 15:04.028
I don't want any surprises.

15:04.028 --> 15:06.531
- You hear the Carters
retained Joe Cataldo?

15:06.531 --> 15:07.990
- Yeah, you ever gone up
against him?

15:07.990 --> 15:10.284
- Never knew how many times
one man could drop,

15:10.284 --> 15:11.911
"I represented
some of the Patriots,"

15:11.911 --> 15:13.955
into any given conversation.

15:13.955 --> 15:16.833
- Yeah, well, he may be loud,
but he's not an idiot.

15:16.833 --> 15:18.251
He knows as well as we do,

15:18.251 --> 15:20.878
there's no law against assisted
suicide in Massachusetts.

15:21.963 --> 15:23.506
- You worried
about the indictment?

15:23.506 --> 15:25.091
- No, indictment's easy.

15:25.091 --> 15:26.759
We need motive.

15:26.759 --> 15:28.845
Well, we've got the texts

15:28.845 --> 15:31.097
showing the three versions

15:31.097 --> 15:33.850
one to Coco urging him
to go through with it,

15:33.850 --> 15:35.184
one to the friends

15:35.184 --> 15:36.853
acting like she doesn't have
a care in the world,

15:36.853 --> 15:39.063
and one to the other friends

15:39.063 --> 15:41.607
in which she's lying
about her missing boyfriend.

15:42.608 --> 15:44.944
- Well, you don't
sound convinced.

15:44.944 --> 15:47.029
- I still think
attention-grabbing texts

15:47.029 --> 15:49.115
are a long way away
from manslaughter.

15:49.115 --> 15:51.284
- Mm. We'll talk to the others.

16:13.848 --> 16:16.559
- Dinner's ready.
- Thanks, Coco.

16:16.559 --> 16:19.520
Fuck, Sydney, I'm sorry.
Sorry, honey.

16:19.520 --> 16:20.938
- It's okay, Dad.

16:20.938 --> 16:23.107
- My dad called me by
my sister's name all the time.

16:34.076 --> 16:36.370
- I think it's time
we sell the truck, Dad.

16:38.414 --> 16:40.124
- What truck?

16:40.124 --> 16:42.418
- What do you mean, what truck?

16:43.711 --> 16:45.254
Lynn and I talked about--
- Fuck Lynn.

16:45.254 --> 16:47.465
It's not her truck.
Isn't even your truck.

16:47.465 --> 16:49.800
For fuck's sake,
it wasn't even Coco's truck.

16:49.800 --> 16:51.928
It's my goddamn truck,
and I'll sell it

16:51.928 --> 16:53.846
if and whenever
I goddamn please.

16:53.846 --> 16:55.306
- I don't wanna have to look
at it anymore, Dad.

16:55.306 --> 16:57.725
What does it matter?

16:57.725 --> 16:59.852
- How are fucking the dots
not connecting for you?

16:59.852 --> 17:01.479
- You gotta put
your feelings aside.

17:01.479 --> 17:03.189
It's just a thing.
- Here we go.

17:03.189 --> 17:04.565
- Oh, where are we going?
- I don't know.

17:04.565 --> 17:06.567
You being
the shining fucking example

17:06.567 --> 17:08.486
of whatever the fuck
you wanna be that day.

17:08.486 --> 17:09.737
- What does that even mean?

17:09.737 --> 17:11.364
What's--where are you going?

17:11.364 --> 17:12.448
- I can't do this.
- Where you going? Hey.

17:12.448 --> 17:13.783
Come on, get back here

17:13.783 --> 17:15.534
and finish what you started.

17:15.534 --> 17:16.869
You coward.

17:28.965 --> 17:30.424
Fuck!

18:02.081 --> 18:03.708
Green apple, your fave.

18:03.708 --> 18:05.918
Oh, my God, yes.

18:05.918 --> 18:08.921
I'm gonna tear through this
in one inning.

18:17.930 --> 18:19.307
- What's wrong?

18:20.433 --> 18:23.102
- Me and my mom have been
nonstop fighting.

18:23.102 --> 18:24.353
- About?

18:26.188 --> 18:29.066
- She's just being
super strict.

18:29.066 --> 18:32.737
She doesn't want me staying up
late texting you anymore.

18:32.737 --> 18:34.739
She was like,
"You don't do this

18:34.739 --> 18:36.198
with any
of your other friends."

18:37.950 --> 18:39.368
- She said that?

18:39.368 --> 18:40.703
- She went through
the phone bill

18:40.703 --> 18:43.831
and, like, pointed
to every time we talked.

18:47.001 --> 18:50.755
- But you're not gonna stop
talking to me, right?

18:52.089 --> 18:54.467
- Of course not.
Come on.

18:56.552 --> 18:59.180
- So we still hanging out
after practice?

19:00.473 --> 19:02.600
- I mean, I want to.

19:02.600 --> 19:05.311
I just have to check
with my mom first.

19:12.777 --> 19:14.820


19:22.119 --> 19:23.412
You only need a capful.

19:23.412 --> 19:24.580
Otherwise
you'll smell like potpourri.

19:24.580 --> 19:26.499
- Huh?
- Huh?

19:29.377 --> 19:31.921
Then you have to separate
the light and dark colors.

19:31.921 --> 19:34.048
Otherwise this T-shirt
turns this one pink.

19:34.048 --> 19:35.508
- Ma, I got it.

19:38.594 --> 19:40.137
I don't know
how you listen to that.

19:42.056 --> 19:45.226
- It's like poetry.
The words just...

19:45.226 --> 19:47.269
flow.

19:47.269 --> 19:50.064
There's no getting tripped up.

19:50.064 --> 19:51.649
No one gets caught up
on, you know,

19:51.649 --> 19:53.734
what they're gonna say next.

19:55.194 --> 19:58.114
- Maybe you can make me
a tape.

19:58.114 --> 20:01.242
- Oh, my God, a tape. A tape?

20:01.242 --> 20:04.787
Ma, it's not 1995.

20:08.040 --> 20:09.417
I'll make you a playlist.

20:19.468 --> 20:21.095
The meds are helping.

20:27.351 --> 20:29.895
- Just a capful,
then you're all set.

20:39.989 --> 20:42.366
"Did you delete the messages?"

20:42.366 --> 20:45.286
"Yes, but you're
going to keep texting me."

20:45.286 --> 20:47.455
"No, I'm not gonna sleep

20:47.455 --> 20:49.832
until you're in the car
with the generator on."

20:50.791 --> 20:52.918
Your client sent those
text messages, Mr. Cataldo.

20:52.918 --> 20:54.336
It's all right there
in the indictment.

20:55.463 --> 20:57.631
- Assisted suicide
isn't illegal in Massachusetts.

20:57.631 --> 21:00.426
- Right, but what we have here
isn't your client assisting.

21:00.426 --> 21:01.969
She's masterminding.
That's manslaughter.

21:01.969 --> 21:03.345
- We'll see.

21:03.345 --> 21:05.598
- I'd save it for trial.
We're here to negotiate bail.

21:05.598 --> 21:07.308
$2,500 cash.
- Agreed.

21:07.308 --> 21:09.226
- No phone, no internet,
no social media.

21:09.226 --> 21:10.519
- No internet, fine,
but my client needs to be able

21:10.519 --> 21:11.937
to contact
her immediate family.

21:11.937 --> 21:13.606
She's got no record whatsoever.
- Agreed.

21:13.606 --> 21:15.107
- Okay.
- See you tomorrow.

21:15.107 --> 21:16.400
Bright and early.

21:17.651 --> 21:19.403
A grand jury
<i>has indicted Michelle</i>

21:19.403 --> 21:20.863
for involuntary manslaughter.
Okay, you told us

21:20.863 --> 21:22.031
this wasn't a big deal,
nothing was gonna come of it.

21:22.031 --> 21:23.699
Now she's being charged
with murder?

21:23.699 --> 21:25.659
Well, it's not murder.
It's manslaughter.

21:25.659 --> 21:26.786
Manslaughter. Right, okay.

21:26.786 --> 21:28.162
Yeah, there's a difference.

21:28.162 --> 21:29.538
A mediocre prosecutor
can't swing a dead cat

21:29.538 --> 21:31.123
and not secure an indictment.

21:31.123 --> 21:33.083
The grand jury only hears
the prosecution's side.

21:33.083 --> 21:34.877
I'm not there to defend you,
to tell your side.

21:34.877 --> 21:36.128
- Then let me tell my side.

21:36.128 --> 21:37.671
- Are we getting a copy?
- Yeah, yeah.

21:37.671 --> 21:39.673
You can make sure they get a
copy of that before they leave.

21:39.673 --> 21:42.468
Now, tomorrow Michelle
is gonna turn herself in

21:42.468 --> 21:44.053
to police custody.
- What?

21:44.053 --> 21:45.095
- I didn't do anything wrong.
- You'll be in and out.

21:45.095 --> 21:46.222
You'll be in and out.

21:46.222 --> 21:47.723
- This is insane.
- Okay, so wait.

21:47.723 --> 21:50.059
This--so if she's convicted,
what kind of a sentence

21:50.059 --> 21:51.227
is she facing?

21:52.686 --> 21:54.939
- A charge like this?

21:54.939 --> 21:56.106
Up to 20 years.

21:56.106 --> 21:57.566
-  20 years?
- That's ridiculous.

21:57.566 --> 21:58.776
But it's never gonna happen.

21:58.776 --> 22:00.236
- She's just a--
- Mr. Cataldo!

22:00.236 --> 22:01.570
- It's never gonna happen?
- It's never gonna--

22:01.570 --> 22:03.155
If I had been in the room-
this is a grand jury.

22:03.155 --> 22:04.615
This is completely different
than going to trial.

22:04.615 --> 22:06.283
- You promised us--
- She's a child!

22:06.283 --> 22:07.952
- Just let me--

22:09.745 --> 22:11.622
Just let me tell my side.

22:16.836 --> 22:18.921
- Um...

22:18.921 --> 22:22.007
uh, I need to ask you
something.

22:22.007 --> 22:23.634
Um...

22:23.634 --> 22:26.095
the prosecution
is basing their case

22:26.095 --> 22:28.013
on a text that you sent
to a friend,

22:28.013 --> 22:30.266
a text that they view
is an admission of guilt.

22:31.934 --> 22:36.939
Michelle, when you were
on the phone with Conrad

22:36.939 --> 22:40.109
the night of his death,

22:40.109 --> 22:44.613
did you--did you tell him
to get back in the truck?

23:50.596 --> 23:52.139
- What are you doing
on my computer?

23:52.139 --> 23:53.515
- Just--

23:53.515 --> 23:54.725
You're not supposed
to use a computer at all.

23:54.725 --> 23:56.435
Mom and Dad told me.
- Five more minutes.

23:56.435 --> 23:58.062
- To do what,
stalk Natalie and Cassie,

23:58.062 --> 24:00.439
who don't even like you?

26:35.677 --> 26:36.970
Michelle?

26:43.977 --> 26:45.395
You all right?

26:45.395 --> 26:46.605
- Yeah.

26:58.450 --> 27:00.744
What are we doing here?

27:00.744 --> 27:03.956
- Getting my oil changed.
What do you think?

27:08.794 --> 27:10.420
What am I supposed to do?

27:12.047 --> 27:14.716
- Think about all the things
we don't talk about.

27:16.677 --> 27:18.804
Things that are
too hard to talk about.

27:18.804 --> 27:22.432
- I told Mom I don't want
to go to therapy.

27:22.432 --> 27:23.851
- And that's fine.

27:25.853 --> 27:27.729
But you need something,

27:27.729 --> 27:29.898
'cause whatever you're doing
ain't working.

27:33.318 --> 27:35.946
We all just want you
to feel better, Coco.

27:41.618 --> 27:42.953
Life's tough.

27:45.581 --> 27:47.833
Gotta find something
that makes you happy.

27:50.502 --> 27:53.338
- Are you saying
I don't have any purpose?

27:53.338 --> 27:55.632
Everyone's got a purpose, Coco.

27:55.632 --> 27:59.219
You just gotta figure out
whatever the hell it is.

28:05.934 --> 28:09.396
'Cause when you do,

28:09.396 --> 28:11.648
everything'll clear up.

28:11.648 --> 28:15.611
All those problems...

28:15.611 --> 28:17.654
gone.

28:24.036 --> 28:25.162
- Yeah.

28:25.704 --> 28:27.039
- Yeah.

29:09.957 --> 29:11.166
- I'm here.

29:14.127 --> 29:15.754
Why is your life a joke?

29:19.299 --> 29:20.842
- I don't know.

29:20.842 --> 29:22.386
Just feel like it's fucked up.

29:23.887 --> 29:27.182
- It's not fucked up, though.

29:27.182 --> 29:28.684
- You don't know
what I'm thinking.

29:30.477 --> 29:31.853
Then tell me.

29:38.902 --> 29:40.654
- I started to realize
that I'm not doing

29:40.654 --> 29:42.406
as great as I thought I was.

29:45.826 --> 29:47.786
I can't hide it anymore.
I can't--

29:51.206 --> 29:52.916
I can't pretend
everything's okay.

29:52.916 --> 29:54.126
Everything's not okay.

29:56.253 --> 29:59.423
And it's all just gotten worse
since I started talking to you.

30:00.382 --> 30:01.883
- I'm making things worse
for you?

30:01.883 --> 30:03.343
No, no, no.

30:03.343 --> 30:06.388
No, I just mean that--

30:06.388 --> 30:09.307
with me, in my head.

30:11.435 --> 30:12.686
- You scared me.

30:12.686 --> 30:15.147
I thought you meant
I was making it worse.

30:15.147 --> 30:17.858
- Like, I'm trying
to better myself.

30:19.526 --> 30:21.695
Thinking about getting
my captain's license.

30:24.531 --> 30:28.493
Trying to just focus
on the future.

30:28.493 --> 30:30.871
Doing something with myself.

30:35.625 --> 30:37.669
But it's--it's pointless.

30:39.421 --> 30:41.757
- You know what? You're right.

30:44.176 --> 30:45.594
You're not great.

30:50.766 --> 30:53.602
You're better than great.

30:53.602 --> 30:56.229
You're one of the greatest guys
I've ever met.

30:58.023 --> 30:59.691
You're special, Conrad.

31:01.193 --> 31:03.570
I wish you could see yourself
how I see you.

31:03.570 --> 31:06.073
I don't deserve you.

31:06.073 --> 31:07.574
- You do deserve me.

31:10.660 --> 31:13.413
You deserve
the very best of everything.

31:21.713 --> 31:23.381
- I love you, Michelle.

31:26.510 --> 31:28.303
<i>Conrad again?</i>

31:29.513 --> 31:31.139
Yeah.

31:32.766 --> 31:34.810
- Wait.

31:34.810 --> 31:36.311
Did he say he loves you?

31:40.190 --> 31:42.109
Did you tell him you love him?

31:43.693 --> 31:44.861
- Yeah.

31:46.947 --> 31:48.073
Why?

31:49.825 --> 31:52.285
Mm, we say it to each other.

31:54.496 --> 31:56.957
- That's different.

32:05.549 --> 32:07.050
- Conrad, I don't know.

32:07.050 --> 32:08.343
I mean...

32:10.053 --> 32:12.013
I feel something with him.

32:12.013 --> 32:14.766
Not the same as with you
but something.

32:16.810 --> 32:18.228
He gets me.

32:20.230 --> 32:22.107
So do you, so...

32:24.276 --> 32:27.654
It just gets...confusing.

32:31.283 --> 32:32.826
- Oh.

32:32.826 --> 32:35.912
- Do you think you can be in
love with two people at once?

32:43.837 --> 32:46.965
- Susie, enough. It's late.

32:46.965 --> 32:48.592
You need to get inside
and go to bed.

32:48.592 --> 32:50.719
Michelle, call your mom.
She needs to pick you up.

32:52.721 --> 32:53.805
Now.

32:55.015 --> 32:56.224
- I'll walk.

33:54.574 --> 33:56.034
Hey.

33:56.034 --> 33:57.911
- What are you doing here?

33:57.911 --> 34:01.873
- I was just checking in
to make sure you're okay.

34:01.873 --> 34:04.376
I called you and texted you,
like, a million times.

34:04.376 --> 34:06.336
- My mom took my phone away.

34:06.336 --> 34:07.545
- Oh.

34:08.463 --> 34:11.299
She doesn't want me
talking to you anymore.

34:12.759 --> 34:14.177
- Why?

34:15.220 --> 34:17.472
- She read our texts.

34:17.472 --> 34:20.350
Went through all
of our messages on Facebook.

34:20.350 --> 34:21.518
Everything.

34:22.602 --> 34:24.104
- So?

34:24.104 --> 34:25.730
- So?

34:25.730 --> 34:27.691
She thinks
you're obsessed with me.

34:31.486 --> 34:33.697
- Well, I'm--I'm not.

34:33.697 --> 34:35.615
- I'm not into girls, Michelle.

34:37.117 --> 34:38.618
I'm not into you.

34:44.457 --> 34:46.209
You just need to get over me.

34:48.545 --> 34:50.672
- Wait, Susie.

35:12.444 --> 35:13.612
- Is Susie okay?

35:13.612 --> 35:15.238
- Yeah, she just has the flu.

35:31.880 --> 35:34.633
I'll celebrate when we
secure a guilty verdict.

35:34.633 --> 35:36.301
You consider this
celebrating?

35:38.678 --> 35:40.055
- I need to find a case

35:40.055 --> 35:41.556
where the defendant
was found guilty

35:41.556 --> 35:43.558
of homicide by counseling
but without the accused--

35:43.558 --> 35:45.727
- Accused party present.

35:45.727 --> 35:47.437
I pulled some cases.

35:49.814 --> 35:52.984
- People versus Campbell.

35:52.984 --> 35:55.362
Guy gets his girlfriend
to shoot herself

35:55.362 --> 35:57.697
yet never even touches the gun.

35:57.697 --> 35:59.783
Served time.
- Great.

36:04.079 --> 36:07.457
I can't imagine
what it's like to lose a kid.

36:07.457 --> 36:09.626
And then to be able to blame
someone for that loss?

36:11.503 --> 36:14.255
- Is that what we're doing,
blaming her?

36:14.255 --> 36:15.590
- Yeah,
that's what we're doing.

36:16.841 --> 36:18.259
Are you having second thoughts?

36:21.054 --> 36:22.514
I'm not gonna bullshit you.

36:22.514 --> 36:24.683
Setting precedent
doesn't happen very often

36:24.683 --> 36:26.393
and for good reason.

36:26.393 --> 36:27.644
I know you know this,

36:27.644 --> 36:29.771
but there is a lot at stake
with this one.

36:29.771 --> 36:32.399
- Nah, just my career,

36:32.399 --> 36:34.359
the future
of an 18-year-old girl,

36:34.359 --> 36:36.361
the hopes of his family
and hers.

36:36.361 --> 36:38.196
- Piece of cake.

36:39.030 --> 36:41.533
Evening, ladies.
Think I found something.

36:42.492 --> 36:44.536
2013, Conrad Jr. and his son

36:44.536 --> 36:46.913
got into a physical
altercation.

36:46.913 --> 36:50.125
Conrad III was sent to
the hospital with a concussion.

36:50.125 --> 36:51.668
Dad was arrested
and court-ordered

36:51.668 --> 36:53.670
to attend counseling,
which he hasn't completed.

36:53.670 --> 36:55.922
He's on probation
because of it.

36:56.715 --> 36:59.884
- This was a few months
before Conrad killed himself.

36:59.884 --> 37:02.262
- If I'm Cataldo,
I just figured out

37:02.262 --> 37:04.097
Conrad's motive
for killing himself.

37:04.097 --> 37:06.015
And it is not Michelle Carter.

37:08.101 --> 37:10.395
The jury can't see this.

37:13.982 --> 37:15.316
- Oh.

37:18.820 --> 37:21.114
- I think the Sox
are gonna win this year.

37:21.114 --> 37:23.616
- You gonna make a bet?

37:23.616 --> 37:26.244
- $50 on the Sox.
- $50?

37:26.244 --> 37:29.247
Show me the cash.
- Ah, it's at home.

37:29.247 --> 37:31.750
- Huh. Right.

37:31.750 --> 37:34.335
And the check is in
the fucking mail.

37:35.420 --> 37:36.838
- Check the slot, old man.

37:42.260 --> 37:44.679
I'll give you "old man."

37:49.642 --> 37:51.436
Come on, come on.

37:52.979 --> 37:56.024
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

37:57.233 --> 37:58.568
Follow me.

37:59.861 --> 38:00.904
- Where we going?

38:00.904 --> 38:03.323
- I got something to show you.

38:03.323 --> 38:04.949
- What is it?

38:04.949 --> 38:06.659
Ugh.

38:06.659 --> 38:08.703
You know what a surprise is?

38:18.963 --> 38:20.340
- That's--

38:24.135 --> 38:26.513
That's mine?

38:26.513 --> 38:28.264
- Yeah.

38:28.264 --> 38:29.599
It's all yours.

38:35.688 --> 38:38.274
Go get--get in--
get in the fucking thing.

38:40.235 --> 38:41.778
- Go.
- Thank you.

38:41.778 --> 38:43.780
- Well, get outta here.

39:51.347 --> 39:53.266
<i>I'm dead serious.</i>

39:53.266 --> 39:54.976
<i>I am too.</i>

39:54.976 --> 39:56.603
<i>I'd love it.</i>

40:06.654 --> 40:09.073
<i>We can start over.</i>

40:09.073 --> 40:11.659
<i>Finally be happy.</i>

40:11.659 --> 40:13.369
<i>Buy a house.</i>

40:13.369 --> 40:15.371
I'll have
<i>my captain's license.</i>

40:15.371 --> 40:17.957
<i>I can find work on boats.</i>

40:17.957 --> 40:22.086
<i>But my own boat,</i>
<i>not my family's.</i>

40:22.086 --> 40:24.923
I don't have
<i>any money right now.</i>

40:24.923 --> 40:26.215
<i>But I'll find an amazing job</i>

40:26.215 --> 40:27.759
<i>so we can buy the house</i>
<i>sooner.</i>

40:27.759 --> 40:30.929
The people out there
<i>are so chill.</i>

40:30.929 --> 40:33.014
<i>Everybody's different.</i>

40:33.014 --> 40:35.266
We'll find friends
<i>we actually like</i>

40:35.266 --> 40:37.143
<i>that get us too.</i>

40:37.143 --> 40:40.146
<i>- And travel the world?</i>
- And get married?

40:40.146 --> 40:42.106
<i>Hmm. Maybe.</i>

40:43.942 --> 40:45.735
<i>And have kids?</i>

40:45.735 --> 40:47.695
<i>I want five.</i>

40:47.695 --> 40:49.697
<i>Five boys, to be exact.</i>

40:49.697 --> 40:53.117
Ambitious.
<i>We'd have to practice.</i>

40:53.117 --> 40:54.327
<i>A lot.</i>

40:58.039 --> 40:59.707

<i>And then grow old together.</i>

41:01.334 --> 41:03.461
<i>Until we're raisins.</i>

41:05.964 --> 41:07.340
- I love you.

41:10.259 --> 41:11.511
Say it back.

41:14.222 --> 41:15.598
- I love you.

41:20.853 --> 41:22.271
Turn to your left.

41:24.649 --> 41:26.025
To the right.

41:30.905 --> 41:32.156
Turn towards me.

41:35.910 --> 41:38.037
Chin up, eyes forward.
