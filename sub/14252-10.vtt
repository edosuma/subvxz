WEBVTT

00:06.973 --> 00:09.908
The Devore ships are assuming
a tactical formation.

00:09.976 --> 00:12.137
Bridge to Transporter Room.
Status?

00:12.212 --> 00:13.179
All set here, Captain.

00:13.246 --> 00:14.611
Pattern cohesion looks stable.

00:14.681 --> 00:16.273
Cargo Bay 1, report.

00:16.349 --> 00:17.611
The bay is clear.

00:17.684 --> 00:19.242
They're powering weapons.

00:19.319 --> 00:20.251
Why do they bother?

00:20.320 --> 00:21.651
They know we won't resist.

00:21.721 --> 00:23.484
Protocol, Mr. Paris.

00:24.691 --> 00:25.817
They're hailing.

00:28.028 --> 00:31.156
Gaharay vessel,
prepare to be inspected.

00:31.231 --> 00:32.823
Crew members are instructed

00:32.899 --> 00:34.366
to step away
from their stations.

00:34.467 --> 00:35.695
We know the drill.

00:35.802 --> 00:38.566
Side arms and scanning equipment
are to be set aside.

00:38.671 --> 00:40.002
Deviation from this

00:40.073 --> 00:42.940
or any other inspection
protocols will not be tolerated.

00:43.009 --> 00:45.773
All hands, this is the Captain.

00:45.845 --> 00:48.678
Prepare to be boarded
by Devore inspection teams.

00:48.748 --> 00:50.375
Give them your full cooperation.

00:50.450 --> 00:52.247
Let's get this over with.

00:52.318 --> 00:58.848
Their soldiers have materialized
on Decks 15, 1 1, 4 and 1.

01:03.630 --> 01:06.963
Captain Janeway,
report to your ready room.

01:10.470 --> 01:12.938
Good morning, Captain.

01:13.006 --> 01:15.338
l took the liberty
of playing this music

01:15.408 --> 01:16.636
throughout your ship.

01:16.709 --> 01:19.177
l thought it might help
your crew relax.

01:19.245 --> 01:22.646
Sometimes these inspections
can be stressful.

01:22.715 --> 01:24.307
How thoughtful.

01:24.384 --> 01:27.945
l've replicated some coffee.

01:28.021 --> 01:29.010
Black, as usual?

01:30.924 --> 01:32.482
Black.

01:32.559 --> 01:36.461
Prax here still refuses
to try it,

01:36.529 --> 01:40.693
but then, he's a man
of few pleasures.

01:46.873 --> 01:50.001
Captain,
please make yourself at home.

01:52.000 --> 01:58.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:30.603 --> 04:32.764
Those cell cultures
are extremely fragile.

04:32.872 --> 04:33.964
Please...

04:44.350 --> 04:47.285
You've been routing power
through your transporter system.

04:47.353 --> 04:48.786
Why?

04:48.855 --> 04:50.117
lt's a routine diagnostic.

04:50.189 --> 04:52.521
We've been having trouble
with our imaging scanners.

04:52.592 --> 04:55.390
The problem is in the primary
energizing coils.

04:55.461 --> 04:57.224
Focus your efforts there.

04:59.499 --> 05:01.990
Thanks for the tip.

05:21.821 --> 05:24.119
Contaminated antimatter.

05:24.190 --> 05:26.681
This material could interfere
with our readings.

05:30.296 --> 05:32.389
A bionetic implant?

05:32.465 --> 05:33.659
An interlink node.

05:33.733 --> 05:36.702
lt permits communication
with other Borg drones.

05:36.769 --> 05:38.202
You are not a telepath.

05:38.271 --> 05:40.239
No.

05:41.841 --> 05:45.072
Remarkable.

05:45.144 --> 05:46.441
How old is this?

05:46.512 --> 05:47.706
About 600 years.

05:47.780 --> 05:50.578
My grandfather gave it
to me when l was a child.

05:50.650 --> 05:53.278
lt seems you have
a long-standing obsession

05:53.353 --> 05:54.945
with exploration, Captain.

05:55.088 --> 05:58.489
l, on the other hand,
have much more in common

05:58.558 --> 06:00.458
with this ancient soldier.

06:00.526 --> 06:02.255
He's from Earth's
classical period.

06:02.328 --> 06:04.819
lt produced some of our
greatest artists as well.

06:04.897 --> 06:08.833
Your culture has
many contradictions.

06:08.968 --> 06:12.665
Violence and beauty,
science and faith...

06:12.772 --> 06:15.832
all somehow mingled
harmoniously.

06:16.008 --> 06:18.101
Like the counterpoint
of this music.

06:18.177 --> 06:20.372
Mahler, Symphony #1.

06:20.446 --> 06:21.879
Am l correct?

06:21.948 --> 06:22.880
You're getting to know

06:22.949 --> 06:24.416
my musical database
better than l do.

06:24.484 --> 06:26.884
l've had time to review it
since our last encounter.

06:26.953 --> 06:29.353
Tell me, are all of your
inspections this personal?

06:29.422 --> 06:31.583
l'm just trying to get
to know you, Captain.

06:31.657 --> 06:33.784
There's no reason for us
to be adversaries.

06:33.860 --> 06:35.191
l could be your friend

06:35.261 --> 06:37.889
and, right now,
you could certainly use one.

06:37.964 --> 06:39.727
Really? Why is that?

06:39.799 --> 06:41.130
Your predicament.

06:41.234 --> 06:44.203
l don't expect it's been easy.

06:44.270 --> 06:47.603
Thousands of light-years
from home,

06:47.673 --> 06:49.698
navigating by strange stars,

06:49.809 --> 06:52.471
trespassing
in other people's space,

06:52.545 --> 06:54.342
ignoring their laws.

06:54.414 --> 06:56.348
We're just trying
to get back to Earth, lnspector.

06:56.416 --> 06:57.815
Through the Devore lmperium?

06:57.884 --> 06:59.408
lt's tough to avoid.

06:59.485 --> 07:01.282
Still, most people
make the effort.

07:01.354 --> 07:03.254
We don't exactly embrace
outsiders.

07:03.322 --> 07:04.755
''Gaharay. ''

07:04.824 --> 07:07.315
lt means ''strangers.''

07:07.393 --> 07:09.293
Which brings me to a matter

07:09.362 --> 07:12.229
that could threaten
our friendship.

07:12.298 --> 07:18.464
l've examined your crew manifest
from our last inspection.

07:18.571 --> 07:22.803
Commander Tuvok, Ensign Vorik--
Vulcans.

07:22.875 --> 07:25.139
Ensigns Suder and Jurot--
Betazoids.

07:25.211 --> 07:26.678
All telepaths...

07:26.746 --> 07:30.147
and yet for some reason,
you neglected to mention them.

07:30.216 --> 07:31.877
For a very simple reason.

07:32.018 --> 07:33.280
They're dead.

07:33.352 --> 07:35.877
Tuvok, Vorik and Jurot
died in a shuttle crash

07:35.988 --> 07:37.421
about two months ago.

07:37.490 --> 07:41.187
Suder was killed in a conflict
with a species called the Kazon.

07:41.260 --> 07:42.852
That's fortunate...

07:42.929 --> 07:44.362
for you, l mean.

07:44.430 --> 07:46.295
lf l'd found you
were harboring telepaths,

07:46.365 --> 07:48.629
l would have had to arrest you

07:48.701 --> 07:50.896
for breaking
our Cardinal Protocol.

07:51.037 --> 07:53.835
They were valued members
of my crew, lnspector,

07:53.906 --> 07:55.168
not criminals.

07:55.241 --> 07:57.209
Perhaps.

07:57.310 --> 07:59.938
Captain...

08:00.012 --> 08:01.843
do you trust me?

08:01.881 --> 08:02.939
Not for a second.

08:02.982 --> 08:04.381
Exactly.

08:04.450 --> 08:05.815
And why should you?

08:05.952 --> 08:07.647
Trust has to be earned.

08:07.720 --> 08:09.210
lt's gradual,

08:09.288 --> 08:12.052
and yet it's the foundation
of every relationship,

08:12.124 --> 08:14.217
professional and personal.

08:14.293 --> 08:19.458
lt's also a concept
alien to the telepathic races.

08:19.532 --> 08:21.363
Why take someone at their word

08:21.467 --> 08:23.628
when you can simply read
their mind?

08:24.971 --> 08:26.700
We've completed our inspection.

08:26.806 --> 08:28.569
There are no telepaths aboard.

08:28.641 --> 08:31.542
However, their sensor logs
indicate they deviated

08:31.611 --> 08:34.239
from their assigned
course on two occasions.

08:34.313 --> 08:37.840
ln both cases,
to avoid ion storms.

08:37.917 --> 08:42.513
lmperative 32, Codicil 626:

08:42.587 --> 08:44.215
''All gaharay vessels.

08:44.290 --> 08:46.281
''that deviate
from prescribed flight vectors

08:46.359 --> 08:48.884
will be impounded, their crews
detained and relocated.''

08:48.961 --> 08:50.394
Prax, it's clear

08:50.463 --> 08:53.557
the Captain didn't
intend to break protocol.

08:53.633 --> 08:56.431
l expect we can overlook
these infractions.

08:56.536 --> 08:57.594
Sir?

09:00.640 --> 09:01.572
Yes, sir.

09:01.641 --> 09:06.203
Captain, l'm a reasonable man

09:06.279 --> 09:10.375
and you've been cooperative,
but consider this a reminder.

09:10.449 --> 09:13.213
You have a long trip
through Devore space

09:13.286 --> 09:15.481
and good friends
can be an asset.

09:15.555 --> 09:18.149
l'll keep it in mind.

09:33.873 --> 09:35.841
The Devore vessels are
out of range.

09:35.942 --> 09:39.139
Bridge to Transporter Team.
You're clear.

09:43.482 --> 09:45.780
Cargo Bay 1 to Ensign Kim.

09:45.851 --> 09:47.751
Pattern enhancers are in place.

09:48.955 --> 09:51.981
lnitiating rematerialization
sequence.

09:52.058 --> 09:55.050
Harry, l'm routing maximum power
to the transporters.

09:56.662 --> 09:58.459
Got it.

09:58.531 --> 10:01.728
Align the confinement
beam to ten angstroms.

10:01.801 --> 10:03.496
Energizing.

10:06.172 --> 10:09.471
Ensign Kim, the confinement beam
is unstable.

10:09.542 --> 10:11.134
We're trying to correct it now.

10:11.210 --> 10:12.507
What's the problem?

10:12.578 --> 10:15.138
We're unable to consolidate
their patterns.

10:15.214 --> 10:17.273
They've been
in suspension too long.

10:18.651 --> 10:21.814
Harry, increase power
to the imaging scanners.

10:21.887 --> 10:22.876
Aye, Captain.

10:24.957 --> 10:26.447
lt's working.

10:47.346 --> 10:48.540
Nice work, Harry.

10:48.614 --> 10:50.980
All our guests are present
and accounted for.

10:51.050 --> 10:52.142
Captain...

10:52.218 --> 10:54.118
They're gone... for now.

11:01.027 --> 11:03.154
Captain's Log, supplemental.

11:03.229 --> 11:05.197
After weeks
of playing hide-and-seek

11:05.264 --> 11:08.131
with the Devore inspectors,
our goal is near--

11:08.234 --> 11:10.794
a transport vessel
that will take our passengers

11:10.903 --> 11:13.736
to a wormhole leading
out of hostile territory.

11:15.508 --> 11:16.941
Back to your old self again?

11:17.076 --> 11:18.737
Each time we do this,
l feel as though l've left

11:18.811 --> 11:20.711
a few molecules behind
in your cargo bay.

11:20.780 --> 11:22.077
Well, l'll have someone
scan the room

11:22.148 --> 11:23.376
if it'll make you feel better.

11:23.449 --> 11:24.939
Kir, we just received
an encoded message

11:25.017 --> 11:26.177
from the transport vessel.

11:26.252 --> 11:28.117
They've changed the
rendezvous point again.

11:28.187 --> 11:29.154
l'm afraid so.

11:29.221 --> 11:30.848
Did they send
the new coordinates?

11:30.923 --> 11:32.322
We're still waiting for them.

11:32.391 --> 11:34.450
Captain, we may have
another problem.

11:34.527 --> 11:36.961
l just treated Tuvok
and two of the refugees

11:37.029 --> 11:38.690
for acute cellular degradation.

11:38.764 --> 11:40.891
l've repaired
most of the damage,

11:40.966 --> 11:42.957
but unfortunately,
the effect is cumulative.

11:43.069 --> 11:43.967
Meaning?

11:44.136 --> 11:46.866
lf we continue to go
into transporter suspension,

11:46.972 --> 11:48.200
some of us may not survive.

11:48.274 --> 11:50.208
Bridge to Captain Janeway.

11:50.276 --> 11:51.208
Go ahead.

11:51.277 --> 11:52.539
We're receiving
another transmission.

11:52.611 --> 11:53.578
Acknowledged.

11:56.682 --> 11:58.309
The new coordinates are here

11:58.384 --> 11:59.942
within a Mutara-class nebula,

12:00.019 --> 12:02.214
2.36 light-years
from our current position.

12:02.321 --> 12:04.016
lt's definitely out of the way--

12:04.056 --> 12:05.546
less chance
of being discovered--

12:05.624 --> 12:07.683
but it'll take
two more days to get there.

12:07.760 --> 12:09.660
Two days--
that increases the chances

12:09.729 --> 12:11.697
that we'll run
into another inspection.

12:11.764 --> 12:13.698
Given the frequency
of patrols in that area,

12:13.766 --> 12:15.631
it's likely we'll be
stopped at least once.

12:15.735 --> 12:17.293
Just what the Doctor
didn't order.

12:17.403 --> 12:19.303
Tuvok, Seven, l want you
to lay in a course

12:19.371 --> 12:21.601
that'll attract
as little attention as possible.

12:21.674 --> 12:23.835
We'll avoid their colonies,
space stations,

12:23.909 --> 12:26.377
tourist attractions--
if they have any.

12:28.147 --> 12:31.344
The Ogre of Fire's castle
hovered over the forest

12:31.417 --> 12:34.875
like a great, black spaceship,
turning day into night.

12:34.954 --> 12:38.355
Now, Flotter and Trevis
knew they had to find a way

12:38.424 --> 12:40.449
to keep the Ogre from
burning the forest down,

12:40.526 --> 12:44.292
but his castle-- it was
higher than the tallest tree.

12:44.363 --> 12:47.389
lt seemed hopeless
until they discovered...

12:47.466 --> 12:48.398
A door.

12:48.467 --> 12:49.627
A door, right.

12:49.735 --> 12:53.171
A mysterious door,
right in the middle of a...

12:53.239 --> 12:54.638
The clearing.

12:54.707 --> 12:56.106
You know, it's...

12:56.175 --> 12:58.405
it's not nice
to read people's thoughts

12:58.477 --> 13:00.274
when they're telling a story.

13:00.346 --> 13:02.075
l'm sorry.

13:02.148 --> 13:03.376
lt's all right.

13:06.952 --> 13:09.580
Why don't you all go play
by yourselves for a while?

13:09.655 --> 13:11.179
We'll finish the story later.

13:14.126 --> 13:15.423
How are they doing?

13:15.494 --> 13:16.893
Oh, fine, more or less.

13:16.962 --> 13:19.863
They don't understand
what all the fuss is about,

13:19.932 --> 13:21.900
but they're telepaths, Captain.

13:22.001 --> 13:24.435
lf the parents are
concerned or fearful,

13:24.503 --> 13:27.267
the children feel it, too.

13:27.339 --> 13:28.636
You did the right thing.

13:28.707 --> 13:30.902
lf we hadn't taken them
off that freighter,

13:30.976 --> 13:33.035
they'd be in a detention
center by now.

13:33.112 --> 13:35.842
Well, we're going to make sure
that doesn't happen.

13:35.915 --> 13:37.940
ls the kitchen still open

13:38.083 --> 13:40.643
or are you just serving stories?

13:40.719 --> 13:43.017
For you, it's always open.

13:45.591 --> 13:47.218
Commander,
l'm detecting a vessel,

13:47.293 --> 13:48.851
300,000 kilometers and closing.

13:48.928 --> 13:50.122
The signature is Devore.

13:50.196 --> 13:52.494
Red Alert. Shields up.

13:52.565 --> 13:54.624
Bridge to Captain.

13:54.700 --> 13:55.724
More company, Commander?

13:55.835 --> 13:56.802
Looks like it.

13:56.869 --> 13:58.427
Get our visitors
to the cargo bay.

13:58.537 --> 14:00.232
Stand by
for transporter suspension.

14:00.306 --> 14:01.739
Aye, Captain.

14:01.807 --> 14:02.739
Neelix.

14:02.808 --> 14:03.740
Right away.

14:03.809 --> 14:04.867
Come on, now.

14:04.944 --> 14:07.037
We're going to go
see your parents.

14:07.112 --> 14:08.511
Let's go.

14:09.949 --> 14:11.211
Report.

14:11.283 --> 14:13.877
lt's a scout ship.
One pilot; no other crew.

14:13.986 --> 14:16.784
The vessel hasn't raised shields
or charged weapons.

14:16.856 --> 14:18.221
lf this is another inspection,

14:18.290 --> 14:19.882
it's certainly
a different approach.

14:20.025 --> 14:21.117
We're being hailed.

14:21.193 --> 14:22.683
Open a channel.

14:23.395 --> 14:24.794
Captain.

14:24.864 --> 14:26.422
lnspector.

14:26.498 --> 14:27.692
lt's urgent that we speak.

14:29.335 --> 14:31.701
You know the way
to my ready room.

14:39.011 --> 14:41.104
lt's all right, Ensign.

14:44.483 --> 14:46.542
l submitted
to your previous inspections

14:46.619 --> 14:47.677
because you outgunned me,

14:47.753 --> 14:49.687
but l don't see
any of your warships nearby.

14:49.755 --> 14:51.552
l have no intention
of cooperating.

14:51.624 --> 14:54.092
l'm not here to search Voyager.

14:54.159 --> 14:56.184
Then what do you want,
inspector?

14:56.262 --> 14:58.287
Call me Kashyk, please.

14:58.364 --> 15:00.457
l never liked that title.

15:00.532 --> 15:03.023
ln fact, l've left it behind.

15:03.102 --> 15:04.831
Did somebody offer you

15:04.970 --> 15:07.734
a promotion, or are you
just having a bad day?

15:07.806 --> 15:11.469
l'm defecting,
and l need your help.

15:11.543 --> 15:13.238
Me?

15:13.312 --> 15:17.578
l've come to ask asylum--
safe passage out of Devore space

15:17.650 --> 15:20.983
before l end up
in a detention center myself.

15:21.053 --> 15:25.080
Now, why would l risk
the safety of my crew

15:25.157 --> 15:27.489
by harboring a defector?

15:27.559 --> 15:29.686
Because of what
l'm about to tell you.

15:29.762 --> 15:33.198
lf you continue
on your present course,

15:33.265 --> 15:36.234
you'll be intercepted
by a squadron of my warships.

15:36.302 --> 15:40.238
Voyager will be seized,
your crew imprisoned or worse.

15:40.306 --> 15:43.537
The nebula is a trap, Captain,

15:43.609 --> 15:47.045
to catch vessels
smuggling telepaths.

15:47.112 --> 15:50.081
You've inspected my ship
three times.

15:50.149 --> 15:53.915
You know we aren't smuggling
telepaths or anyone else.

15:53.986 --> 15:57.786
What l know is that you have
12 refugees aboard right now,

15:57.856 --> 16:00.984
that you rescued them
from a freighter three weeks ago

16:01.060 --> 16:02.960
and that you've
been concealing them

16:03.028 --> 16:05.155
in Cargo Bay 1,
using your transporters.

16:05.230 --> 16:06.390
l could have exposed them

16:06.465 --> 16:09.798
at any time, but l wanted them
to escape as much as you do.

16:09.902 --> 16:11.563
l can still protect them,

16:11.670 --> 16:13.661
but only if you
take me with you.

16:13.772 --> 16:17.367
My people know
about the wormhole.

16:17.443 --> 16:20.469
lt's only a matter of time
before they find it.

16:23.282 --> 16:26.274
You have no choice, Captain.

16:26.352 --> 16:29.116
l'm your only hope.

16:41.934 --> 16:44.926
This is our rendezvous point
inside this nebula.

16:45.070 --> 16:46.935
Unfortunately,
the transport vessel

16:47.006 --> 16:49.270
we're supposed to meet
is no longer there.

16:49.341 --> 16:50.433
lnspector.

16:56.715 --> 16:58.046
A Devore warship.

16:58.117 --> 16:59.243
One of a dozen

16:59.318 --> 17:00.876
positioned
throughout the nebula--

17:01.020 --> 17:02.487
all invisible to our sensors

17:02.554 --> 17:04.579
until Kashyk showed
me how to compensate

17:04.656 --> 17:06.282
for their refractive shielding.

17:06.358 --> 17:08.826
Your soldiers intercepted
the transport ship?

17:08.961 --> 17:10.121
Over a week ago.

17:10.194 --> 17:13.425
We were the ones who changed
the rendezvous coordinates.

17:13.499 --> 17:16.832
Two vessels carrying refugees
have already been seized.

17:16.969 --> 17:18.868
Voyager would have been next.

17:19.003 --> 17:20.198
All right, lnspector,

17:20.305 --> 17:22.535
you helped us avoid
this ambush. What now?

17:22.608 --> 17:24.234
We'll have to get
your passengers

17:24.309 --> 17:25.674
to the wormhole on our own.

17:25.743 --> 17:28.440
These are the schedules
and routes of our patrols,

17:28.513 --> 17:31.210
along with tactical
data on our shield

17:31.283 --> 17:33.217
and weapons configurations--
enough to ensure

17:33.285 --> 17:35.082
that you avoid
another inspection.

17:35.154 --> 17:36.678
How long before you're missed?

17:36.755 --> 17:38.313
Well, l took two weeks' leave.

17:38.390 --> 17:40.551
Enough time, l hope,
to find the wormhole

17:40.626 --> 17:42.787
and get your passengers
safely through it,

17:42.861 --> 17:44.522
and myself, as well.

17:44.596 --> 17:45.722
Your data is useful,

17:45.798 --> 17:47.732
but it doesn't guarantee
our success.

17:47.800 --> 17:52.897
No. For that, you'll need
my guidance and some luck.

17:53.005 --> 17:55.565
l'll have to take this
up with the Brenari...

17:55.674 --> 17:58.165
see what they think
of their new benefactor.

17:58.277 --> 18:00.211
l'll let you know
what they decide.

18:00.279 --> 18:03.248
l'll have to insist
you remain under guard.

18:03.315 --> 18:06.216
-No hard feelings.
-No hard feelings.

18:09.254 --> 18:11.449
lt's unusual...
but not unheard of.

18:11.523 --> 18:13.821
There have been
sympathizers before.

18:13.892 --> 18:15.917
Kashyk may be telling the truth.

18:15.994 --> 18:17.393
Maybe you should
just read his thoughts.

18:17.463 --> 18:18.657
Devore soldiers undergo

18:18.730 --> 18:20.823
years of mental training
to prevent that.

18:20.966 --> 18:22.763
He might be telling the truth,

18:22.868 --> 18:25.837
but he also might be using us
to find the wormhole.

18:25.904 --> 18:28.771
So what do we do, throw
him in the brig?

18:28.841 --> 18:30.775
No.

18:30.843 --> 18:33.209
We take him up
on his offer to help,

18:33.278 --> 18:34.575
see how it plays out.

18:34.646 --> 18:36.773
But l want
'round-the-clock security.

18:36.849 --> 18:38.840
We need to watch
his every movement.

18:38.917 --> 18:41.044
That leaves us with
our next question:

18:41.120 --> 18:43.111
How do we find the wormhole?

18:43.188 --> 18:44.655
l've given it some thought.

18:44.723 --> 18:46.486
There's a scientist named Torat.

18:46.558 --> 18:47.991
He's from a nearby system.

18:48.060 --> 18:51.223
He's rumored to know more
about the wormhole than anyone.

18:51.296 --> 18:54.265
He might help us... for a price.

18:54.333 --> 18:55.891
-A price?
-His species power

18:56.068 --> 18:58.628
their ships with a fluidic alloy
that's difficult to find.

18:58.737 --> 18:59.829
Perhaps we can replicate it.

18:59.938 --> 19:01.803
l have some data
on its composition.

19:01.907 --> 19:02.965
See what you can do.

19:03.041 --> 19:04.235
ln the meantime,

19:04.309 --> 19:06.277
we'll set a course
for Torat's planet,

19:06.378 --> 19:07.640
try to track him down.

19:15.988 --> 19:17.922
Nervous?

19:19.324 --> 19:20.951
Let's just say...

19:21.026 --> 19:24.189
l'm not used to other people
deciding my fate.

19:30.169 --> 19:33.195
Until today,
you were part of a government

19:33.305 --> 19:38.174
responsible for persecuting
thousands of innocent people.

19:38.243 --> 19:40.541
Why the sudden change of heart?

19:40.612 --> 19:42.375
There's nothing sudden about it.

19:42.447 --> 19:45.075
l've been looking
for a way to escape for years.

19:45.150 --> 19:47.141
Voyager was
the perfect opportunity.

19:47.219 --> 19:48.379
How so?

19:48.453 --> 19:50.216
Well, what are you suggesting...

19:50.289 --> 19:52.348
l ask a Brenari vessel
for assistance?

19:52.424 --> 19:54.153
They'd throw me out an airlock.

19:54.226 --> 19:56.319
Besides...

19:56.395 --> 19:59.853
you're something
of a humanitarian, Captain.

19:59.932 --> 20:01.559
l've read your database.

20:01.633 --> 20:04.193
l know all about
Starfleet philosophy,

20:04.303 --> 20:06.669
unless you left
those ideals behind

20:06.738 --> 20:08.228
in the Alpha Quadrant.

20:08.340 --> 20:11.901
l certainly don't grant asylum
to every person l meet,

20:11.977 --> 20:14.241
especially ones
who ransack my ship

20:14.313 --> 20:16.304
and terrorize my crew.

20:16.381 --> 20:20.841
You're asking me to believe
you're someone else...

20:20.919 --> 20:26.050
and... that's a leap of
faith l'm not ready to make.

20:26.124 --> 20:28.285
You're turning me away.

20:28.360 --> 20:29.554
No.

20:31.029 --> 20:32.053
No.

20:33.565 --> 20:36.830
l'm going to give you safe
passage to the wormhole...

20:36.935 --> 20:39.699
in return for your help
in getting us there,

20:39.805 --> 20:42.296
but l'm also imposing
some restrictions.

20:42.407 --> 20:44.307
You'll have your own quarters,

20:44.376 --> 20:47.004
but limited access
to Voyager's systems,

20:47.079 --> 20:50.640
and your whereabouts will
be monitored at all times.

20:50.716 --> 20:53.844
l'm used to being surrounded
by armed guards.

20:53.919 --> 20:55.546
Makes me feel secure.

20:57.189 --> 20:59.487
Only this time,
they answer to me.

20:59.558 --> 21:02.891
Consider them a reminder
that Voyager is my ship.

21:02.995 --> 21:05.486
l don't think anyone
could doubt that.

21:18.343 --> 21:20.174
Captain's Log, supplemental.

21:20.245 --> 21:22.179
lt's taken us nearly two days,

21:22.247 --> 21:24.442
but we've managed
to locate Torat,

21:24.516 --> 21:27.576
the man who's supposedly
an expert on wormholes.

21:27.653 --> 21:29.746
Unfortunately,
he seems reluctant

21:29.821 --> 21:31.311
to share his expertise.

21:31.390 --> 21:32.857
He's trying to evade us.

21:32.924 --> 21:34.050
Hail him again.

21:34.126 --> 21:35.923
Mr. Torat doesn't
seem too trusting.

21:35.994 --> 21:38.485
Maybe he's been through
one inspection too many.

21:38.563 --> 21:39.928
No response.

21:39.998 --> 21:42.660
He's deactivated
his communications system.

21:42.734 --> 21:45.464
l think l can tap into his
computer, override the lockout.

21:45.570 --> 21:46.537
Do it.

21:51.143 --> 21:52.906
Go away!

21:54.112 --> 21:55.739
This is Captain Kathryn Janeway

21:55.814 --> 21:57.782
of the Federation
Starship Voyager.

21:57.849 --> 21:59.248
We have no hostile intent.

21:59.318 --> 22:01.115
Then why are you pursuing me?

22:01.219 --> 22:02.151
We'd just like to ask...

22:02.187 --> 22:04.587
Federations, lmperiums...

22:04.656 --> 22:07.318
Why do you people
feel such a need

22:07.392 --> 22:11.453
to align yourselves with
monolithic organizations, hmm?

22:11.530 --> 22:12.519
l'd be glad to discuss that

22:12.597 --> 22:14.565
and any other philosophical
issue you care to raise,

22:14.633 --> 22:16.999
if you would just
slow down and talk.

22:17.102 --> 22:18.364
Sorry. Can't do that.

22:18.470 --> 22:21.769
l'm late
for a very important conference!

22:21.840 --> 22:24.104
This is a waste of time.
Disable his ship.

22:24.176 --> 22:26.076
That's what we call
overkill, lnspector.

22:26.144 --> 22:27.907
Ensign, can we transport
at this range?

22:27.979 --> 22:30.243
Absolutely. Energizing.

22:35.387 --> 22:36.786
Welcome aboard.

22:36.855 --> 22:39.085
Your reputation precedes you.

22:43.095 --> 22:46.826
20 centiliters of mercurium
isochromate-- no impurities--

22:46.898 --> 22:48.456
and this is just a sample.

22:48.533 --> 22:52.731
We've synthesized enough
to power your ship for a year.

22:52.838 --> 22:54.169
lt doesn't matter.

22:54.239 --> 22:57.367
l never heard of this...
wormhole you're looking for,

22:57.442 --> 22:58.966
or these so-called refugees.

22:59.077 --> 23:00.544
Well, they've heard of you.

23:00.645 --> 23:02.875
Well, no doubt--
my research is famous.

23:02.914 --> 23:05.382
Think of all the stars
you could research

23:05.450 --> 23:08.647
once you've infused your
propulsion system with this.

23:08.720 --> 23:10.551
There's no point in bribing me.

23:10.622 --> 23:14.251
He's right. He couldn't
help us if he wanted to.

23:14.326 --> 23:15.725
What do you mean by that?

23:15.794 --> 23:19.286
l doubt you'd know a wormhole
from a dark matter inversion.

23:19.364 --> 23:21.628
Professor... Kashyk
is another expert

23:21.700 --> 23:24.260
l've retained to help
us with this matter.

23:24.369 --> 23:25.495
l'm afraid he's not

23:25.604 --> 23:27.799
as impressed with your work
as l am.

23:27.906 --> 23:30.841
ln fact, he discouraged me
from seeking you out.

23:30.909 --> 23:34.345
Professor Kashyk?
Never heard of you.

23:34.413 --> 23:35.607
Not surprising,

23:35.680 --> 23:38.114
considering you toil
in scientific obscurity.

23:38.183 --> 23:40.708
Obscurity?!

23:40.786 --> 23:43.949
l-l've discovered over 60
astronomical phenomena!

23:44.022 --> 23:47.185
Not worth the sensors
they were recorded on.

23:47.259 --> 23:48.226
Oh...

23:48.293 --> 23:49.954
There's no need
to insult the man.

23:50.095 --> 23:53.587
Just because he doesn't know how
to find an interspatial flexure.

23:53.665 --> 23:55.132
lnterspatial flexure?

23:55.200 --> 23:57.794
Why didn't you say so
in the first place?

23:57.903 --> 24:00.667
He said wormhole--
a layman's term

24:00.739 --> 24:03.708
that... that covers
any number of phenomena.

24:03.809 --> 24:06.243
l am familiar
with a certain anomaly

24:06.311 --> 24:10.839
that could be categorized
as an ''interspatial flexure.''

24:10.916 --> 24:13.111
Where is it?

24:13.185 --> 24:15.153
Actually,
a better question would be:

24:15.220 --> 24:16.517
Where is it now?

24:16.588 --> 24:18.419
lt's really quite interesting.

24:18.490 --> 24:20.458
The aperture of the phenomenon--

24:20.525 --> 24:21.890
which l prefer to call

24:21.960 --> 24:24.793
an intermittent
cyclical vortex-- is unfixed.

24:24.863 --> 24:26.455
lt manifests infrequently,

24:26.531 --> 24:29.762
for only brief periods of time
and in varying locations.

24:37.075 --> 24:39.543
l can give you
the last four locations.

24:39.611 --> 24:42.341
Perhaps you can extrapolate
the next one...

24:42.414 --> 24:46.817
if you're as accomplished
a scientist as you claim to be.

24:54.292 --> 24:55.384
-Think.
-l'm thinking.

24:55.460 --> 24:57.052
Think harder.
Four wormhole appearances

24:57.128 --> 24:59.358
less than 20 light-years apart--
there's no pattern.

24:59.431 --> 25:00.864
Did you apply
a fractal coefficient?

25:00.966 --> 25:01.898
Didn't work.

25:01.967 --> 25:02.831
Neutrino flux parameters?

25:02.968 --> 25:03.832
Mm-hmm.

25:03.969 --> 25:04.833
Statistical algorithms?

25:05.003 --> 25:06.265
Every one l could find.

25:06.371 --> 25:07.838
This wormhole defies analysis.

25:07.973 --> 25:09.065
Maybe Torat was right--

25:09.174 --> 25:10.641
we're just out of our league.

25:10.742 --> 25:12.232
lt's not like you to give up.

25:12.344 --> 25:13.276
Think harder.

25:13.345 --> 25:15.108
How do you predict...

25:15.180 --> 25:17.080
a random occurrence?

25:17.148 --> 25:19.673
You follow your instincts.

25:22.988 --> 25:24.285
Captain?

25:26.191 --> 25:28.022
Counterpoint.

25:28.093 --> 25:29.856
lt's in all great music.

25:29.928 --> 25:32.897
Parallel melodies
playing against one another.

25:32.964 --> 25:34.761
We've been looking
at the obvious--

25:34.833 --> 25:37.893
frequency, location, timing--
but each of those parameters

25:38.036 --> 25:40.004
could have a counterpoint
in subspace.

25:40.105 --> 25:43.199
lf we could run an algorithm
based on subspace harmonics,

25:43.308 --> 25:44.832
it might reveal our pattern.

25:44.943 --> 25:47.741
Computer, run a subspatial
transkinetic analysis

25:47.812 --> 25:49.302
on the wormhole data.

25:49.381 --> 25:50.814
Analysis in progress.

25:50.882 --> 25:52.509
This'll take a minute.

25:58.890 --> 26:01.620
l'm going to miss this...
coffee of yours.

26:01.726 --> 26:03.819
Well, l will give you
the recipe.

26:03.862 --> 26:05.295
Thank you.

26:05.363 --> 26:07.831
You don't sound
too happy about leaving.

26:07.933 --> 26:11.460
The Brenari aren't about
to embrace a former lnspector.

26:11.570 --> 26:14.539
l'll be feared,
hated for what l represent.

26:14.639 --> 26:16.869
Anxiety doesn't
become you, lnspector.

26:16.975 --> 26:18.203
Try to relax a little.

26:18.276 --> 26:20.574
l suppose you liked me better
in uniform.

26:20.645 --> 26:24.308
l haven't decided
whether l like you at all.

26:31.623 --> 26:36.617
We call them the Kolyan Kolyar--
lnfinite Spirals.

26:36.695 --> 26:38.162
Beautiful.

26:38.229 --> 26:42.359
As a boy, l spent years
gazing at these lights.

26:42.434 --> 26:45.232
This is the last time
l'll ever see them.

26:45.337 --> 26:47.897
We have something
similar back on Earth--

26:48.006 --> 26:49.268
the Aurora Borealis.

26:49.341 --> 26:51.434
Which you, too,
may never see again.

26:51.509 --> 26:55.036
l suppose we're both
refugees, in a way.

26:55.113 --> 26:58.742
l'm still counting
on getting this ship home.

26:58.817 --> 27:02.082
Are you sure you'll be
welcome when you do?

27:02.187 --> 27:05.486
l came across something
else in your database--

27:05.523 --> 27:08.117
the ''Prime Directive.''

27:08.193 --> 27:10.320
The Federation's
''Cardinal Protocol.''

27:10.395 --> 27:11.384
lt seems

27:11.463 --> 27:14.125
you violated it when you
rescued these telepaths.

27:14.199 --> 27:17.362
Well, let's just say l usually
go with my instincts...

27:17.469 --> 27:19.960
and sort it out later
at the Board of lnquiry.

27:20.071 --> 27:23.336
Those Admirals and l were
on a first-name basis, you know.

27:23.408 --> 27:25.342
Ah.

27:25.410 --> 27:28.538
You're risking a lot, too.
Why?

27:31.516 --> 27:33.211
Three months ago,

27:33.284 --> 27:36.447
my teams were inspecting
a plasma-refining vessel.

27:36.521 --> 27:38.421
We found a family of telepaths

27:38.490 --> 27:40.890
hiding in one
of the extraction tanks.

27:40.959 --> 27:43.359
There was a child...
very young.

27:43.428 --> 27:48.195
She'd been inside it for days,
barely able to breathe.

27:48.266 --> 27:52.600
When l lifted her out
and set her down on the deck...

27:52.704 --> 27:55.571
she thanked me.

27:55.640 --> 27:58.609
l sent her to a relocation
center with the others,

27:58.710 --> 28:02.942
knowing full well
what would happen to her.

28:03.048 --> 28:06.506
After that, l could think
of nothing else,

28:06.551 --> 28:09.247
and when l couldn't
stand it any longer...

28:11.456 --> 28:14.482
You're my deliverance, Captain.

28:14.559 --> 28:16.584
Analysis complete.

28:26.004 --> 28:27.869
lt worked.

28:28.006 --> 28:31.203
lt looks like it'll appear
in about three days...

28:31.276 --> 28:33.744
less than eight light-years
from here.

28:33.845 --> 28:34.777
The Tehara system.

28:34.846 --> 28:35.778
ls that a problem?

28:35.847 --> 28:37.542
There's an automated
sensor array

28:37.615 --> 28:38.877
between here and Tehara.

28:38.950 --> 28:40.008
Can we go around it?

28:40.085 --> 28:41.518
We'd never make it in time.

28:41.586 --> 28:43.884
We'll have to find a way
to avoid detection.

28:43.988 --> 28:46.456
Let's do it in the morning.

28:46.524 --> 28:49.118
We've done enough for tonight.

28:53.298 --> 28:55.027
Are you saying good-bye?

28:55.100 --> 28:58.092
There'll be other spirals.

28:58.169 --> 29:02.833
They've just never looked
quite so... beautiful before.

29:04.809 --> 29:07.277
Could be the company
l'm keeping.

29:07.345 --> 29:09.506
Or the polarization
axis of the windows.

29:09.581 --> 29:12.106
That must be it.

29:15.086 --> 29:17.714
How often does this array
emit a scanning pulse?

29:17.789 --> 29:18.813
Every 40 seconds.

29:18.957 --> 29:19.821
Range?

29:19.958 --> 29:21.425
Ten light-years.

29:21.493 --> 29:22.824
The pulse is designed

29:22.961 --> 29:25.953
to track warp fields
and impulse signatures.

29:26.030 --> 29:27.588
lf we lower our power output

29:27.665 --> 29:29.690
to beneath its
detection threshold...

29:29.768 --> 29:31.668
We could drift past undetected.

29:31.770 --> 29:33.135
lt's worth a try.

29:37.542 --> 29:40.033
Well, good night.

29:40.145 --> 29:41.772
Captain...

29:41.846 --> 29:43.006
why don't you...

29:44.082 --> 29:45.640
join me?

29:45.717 --> 29:48.345
l've been looking forward
to trying your replicator.

29:48.419 --> 29:50.580
Well, l'm sure that l can
come up with something

29:50.655 --> 29:51.713
to toast the evening.

29:51.790 --> 29:53.690
We've accomplished
quite a bit today.

29:53.758 --> 29:55.487
l'm afraid
that won't be possible.

29:55.560 --> 29:57.494
l had your replicator
taken off-line.

29:57.562 --> 30:00.690
ln case l decided
to replicate a weapon.

30:00.765 --> 30:02.733
A safety precaution,
you understand.

30:02.801 --> 30:05.235
Better than anyone.

30:05.303 --> 30:06.770
Sleep well.

30:07.872 --> 30:08.839
And you.

30:14.245 --> 30:15.678
As you were.

30:26.791 --> 30:27.849
15 seconds.

30:27.926 --> 30:31.726
Our power output is below
the detection threshold.

30:31.796 --> 30:33.024
Ten seconds.

30:36.901 --> 30:38.698
Five... four...

30:38.803 --> 30:39.963
three...

30:40.138 --> 30:41.196
two...

30:45.910 --> 30:47.571
We weren't detected.

30:47.645 --> 30:49.340
Ten minutes
and we'll be out of range.

30:49.414 --> 30:52.281
Engineering to Bridge.
We've got a problem.

30:52.350 --> 30:54.716
That pulse triggered a variance
in the antimatter stream.

30:54.786 --> 30:56.879
lt's not much, but it'll
light us up like a beacon

30:56.955 --> 30:57.979
when the next pulse hits.

30:58.056 --> 30:58.988
Options?

30:59.057 --> 31:00.149
l can't correct it in time.

31:00.258 --> 31:02.886
So that leaves shutting down
the core.

31:02.927 --> 31:03.859
Do it.

31:03.928 --> 31:04.792
The array has released

31:04.863 --> 31:06.091
-another pulse.
-Time?

31:06.164 --> 31:07.256
28 seconds.

31:07.332 --> 31:08.822
Get down
to the plasma injectors.

31:08.900 --> 31:11.232
Grab a tricorder
and monitor the antimatter flow.

31:11.336 --> 31:12.303
Aye, sir.

31:15.373 --> 31:16.271
20 seconds.

31:16.341 --> 31:17.774
B'Elanna...

31:17.842 --> 31:18.866
Almost there, Captain.

31:18.977 --> 31:20.604
l'm having a problem
with the injectors.

31:20.678 --> 31:22.270
15 seconds.

31:24.649 --> 31:26.241
Ten seconds.

31:30.889 --> 31:34.290
Four... three... two...

31:38.997 --> 31:39.929
We've been detected.

31:39.998 --> 31:41.625
The array's transmitting
an alert.

31:41.699 --> 31:43.098
Can we block it?

31:43.201 --> 31:43.792
Negative.

31:43.902 --> 31:45.096
Stand down grey mode.

31:45.203 --> 31:46.795
B'Elanna, fire up the core.

31:46.905 --> 31:48.429
We're getting out of here.

31:48.539 --> 31:50.302
Warships will be on their way,

31:50.375 --> 31:52.502
but we can still
reach the wormhole.

31:52.577 --> 31:53.635
lf we can find it.

31:53.711 --> 31:55.804
Tom, how long
to the Tehara system?

31:55.880 --> 31:57.780
1 1 hours at maximum warp.

31:57.849 --> 31:59.680
Engines are back on line.

31:59.751 --> 32:00.843
Engage.

32:06.057 --> 32:07.456
Using the model we developed,

32:07.525 --> 32:08.890
we were able to narrow
down the location

32:08.993 --> 32:11.086
of the wormhole's next
appearance to a radius

32:11.162 --> 32:12.527
of 200,000 kilometers.

32:12.597 --> 32:13.996
We can't determine

32:14.065 --> 32:16.260
its exact position
until we reach the system,

32:16.334 --> 32:18.564
but we know it will open
in roughly six hours.

32:18.670 --> 32:21.070
And will remain open
for two minutes at most.

32:21.139 --> 32:22.868
l've devised
a new shield modulation,

32:22.941 --> 32:25.102
which should protect us
against their weapons.

32:25.176 --> 32:26.108
You're not planning

32:26.177 --> 32:27.872
to fight your way
to the wormhole?

32:27.946 --> 32:29.208
lf l have to.

32:29.280 --> 32:31.305
Bridge to Captain Janeway.

32:31.382 --> 32:32.406
Go ahead.

32:32.483 --> 32:34.417
Long-range sensors have
picked up two Devore warships

32:34.485 --> 32:35.952
heading right for us.

32:36.087 --> 32:37.076
Time to intercept?

32:37.155 --> 32:38.087
Six hours.

32:38.156 --> 32:39.521
Take the Bridge.
l'll be in Engineering.

32:39.590 --> 32:40.557
Kashyk.

32:42.160 --> 32:44.424
First, we'll check those
shield modifications.

32:44.495 --> 32:46.690
Then we'll see if we
can adjust our phasers

32:46.764 --> 32:48.356
to penetrate the Devore shields.

32:48.433 --> 32:50.867
lf torpedoes don't work,
l want an alternative.

32:50.969 --> 32:53.403
Captain, we have to talk

32:53.471 --> 32:55.132
but not here.

33:00.645 --> 33:04.877
l'm going back
to rejoin the warships.

33:04.983 --> 33:07.076
lt's the only way that l
can guarantee your safety.

33:07.151 --> 33:08.083
Kashyk...

33:08.152 --> 33:09.779
l'm still a ranking officer.

33:09.854 --> 33:12.379
l can take command
of the inspection teams,

33:12.457 --> 33:14.857
make sure the refugees
aren't discovered.

33:14.926 --> 33:16.257
You said yourself
they're suspicious.

33:16.327 --> 33:17.521
Return now and you
risk being caught.

33:17.595 --> 33:18.721
l can keep them off track

33:18.796 --> 33:21.196
long enough to get you
through that wormhole.

33:21.265 --> 33:22.323
lt's too dangerous.

33:22.400 --> 33:23.594
Kathryn...

33:23.701 --> 33:25.396
You asked for safe passage
and l agreed,

33:25.503 --> 33:27.596
under the condition
that you follow my orders.

33:27.705 --> 33:30.265
You may stand a chance
against one of our warships,

33:30.375 --> 33:31.342
but not against two.

33:31.442 --> 33:34.377
lf l stay, your best chance
of escape will be lost.

33:38.583 --> 33:40.915
l could confine you to quarters.

33:42.186 --> 33:44.814
l was planning on asking you
to stay with us,

33:44.889 --> 33:46.857
once we got through
the wormhole.

33:46.924 --> 33:49.119
l wouldn't mind having
someone around

33:49.193 --> 33:52.253
who appreciates a bit
of Tchaikovsky now and then.

33:52.330 --> 33:55.629
Generous, but...

33:55.700 --> 33:58.965
something tells me l wouldn't
fit in any better on Voyager.

33:59.103 --> 34:01.128
Well...

34:01.239 --> 34:03.730
you wouldn't be
the first wayward soul

34:03.841 --> 34:05.809
we've folded into our ranks.

34:08.946 --> 34:12.574
Your shuttle will be ready
for launch within the hour.

34:20.190 --> 34:22.819
Our course will put us
just outside the Teharan system

34:22.893 --> 34:24.418
by the time
the warships arrive.

34:24.495 --> 34:26.690
Your inspection teams
have to be off Voyager

34:26.764 --> 34:28.094
before that wormhole opens.

34:28.166 --> 34:30.862
Believe me, it'll be the
quickest inspection on record.

34:30.967 --> 34:32.025
l'll be on the Bridge.

34:32.136 --> 34:34.103
Your efforts have been
greatly appreciated.

34:34.205 --> 34:36.172
My pleasure.

34:36.239 --> 34:38.504
Live long and prosper.

34:38.576 --> 34:40.043
Thank you.

34:49.954 --> 34:52.445
Begin preignition sequence.

34:55.860 --> 34:57.987
l've made one adjustment
to your plan.

34:59.063 --> 35:00.860
After the inspection,
we're going to wait

35:00.965 --> 35:02.796
at the wormhole
for as long as we can...

35:02.834 --> 35:04.734
until it begins to collapse.

35:04.836 --> 35:07.498
l may not be able
to join you this time.

35:07.605 --> 35:09.368
Try.

36:28.786 --> 36:30.515
They're assuming
a tactical formation.

36:30.588 --> 36:31.555
Shields?

36:31.622 --> 36:33.112
No. We follow protocol.

36:33.191 --> 36:34.988
Bridge to Transporter Room.

36:35.059 --> 36:36.287
Status?

36:36.360 --> 36:38.521
Ready, Captain.
Pattern cohesion stable.

36:38.596 --> 36:39.722
Cargo Bay 1?

36:39.797 --> 36:40.729
Clear.

36:40.798 --> 36:41.765
They're hailing.

36:41.832 --> 36:43.265
On screen.

36:43.334 --> 36:45.165
Gaharay vessel,
prepare to be...

36:45.269 --> 36:47.897
We've been through
three inspections.

36:48.005 --> 36:49.768
Please explain
why another is necessary.

36:49.840 --> 36:52.365
Crew members are instructed to
step away from their stations.

36:52.476 --> 36:56.242
Side arms and scanning equipment
are to be set aside.

36:56.314 --> 36:57.941
Deviation from this
or any other

36:58.015 --> 37:00.711
inspection protocols
will not be tolerated.

37:00.818 --> 37:02.615
All hands, this is the Captain.

37:02.653 --> 37:05.554
Prepare to be boarded
by Devore inspection teams.

37:05.623 --> 37:07.557
Give them
your usual warm welcome.

37:07.625 --> 37:10.253
Devore soldiers
have materialized

37:10.328 --> 37:12.922
on Decks 15, 12, 8, 4...

37:12.997 --> 37:14.794
And... 1.

37:16.500 --> 37:20.197
Captain Janeway,
report to your ready room.

37:24.375 --> 37:26.741
Captain.

37:26.811 --> 37:28.870
Good to see you again.

37:28.946 --> 37:30.573
Likewise.

37:59.844 --> 38:00.811
Tchaikovsky.

38:00.911 --> 38:03.505
Of all the selections
in your database,

38:03.547 --> 38:05.913
this remains my favorite.

38:05.983 --> 38:07.712
Mine, too.

38:07.785 --> 38:10.276
l'm afraid Prax isn't impressed.

38:10.354 --> 38:13.585
He's solely concerned
with his work, aren't you, Prax?

38:13.658 --> 38:14.818
As you say, sir.

38:14.959 --> 38:17.393
Yes, he's curious why
you entered this sector.

38:17.461 --> 38:18.928
You're aware it's restricted.

38:18.996 --> 38:20.293
We were planning to study

38:20.364 --> 38:22.457
a supernova remnant
not far from here.

38:22.533 --> 38:24.626
You strayed a full light-year
from your course

38:24.735 --> 38:26.828
in order to observe
an astronomical phenomenon?

38:27.004 --> 38:28.369
We're explorers.

38:28.439 --> 38:29.371
Yes, l remember.

38:29.440 --> 38:30.771
l also remember warning you

38:30.841 --> 38:32.672
about going
where you don't belong.

38:32.743 --> 38:37.544
Exploring can sometimes
be hard to resist, lnspector.

38:37.615 --> 38:40.140
Well, it's a romantic notion,
Captain,

38:40.217 --> 38:42.811
but one l can't allow you
to indulge.

38:42.887 --> 38:46.584
l'm afraid l'll have to ask you
to leave our space immediately.

38:46.657 --> 38:48.056
Prax, why don't you check

38:48.125 --> 38:50.525
on our teams, while l reiterate

38:50.594 --> 38:53.324
our protocols
for Captain Janeway.

38:58.102 --> 38:59.535
Do they suspect anything?

38:59.603 --> 39:00.763
Not yet,

39:00.871 --> 39:02.099
but our warships

39:02.206 --> 39:04.197
have been monitoring
Voyager's movements

39:04.308 --> 39:06.242
for the past few days,
and mine as well.

39:06.310 --> 39:07.777
l don't think we have much time.

39:07.878 --> 39:08.810
The Brenari?

39:08.913 --> 39:10.710
They're in transporter
suspension.

39:10.781 --> 39:12.339
And the wormhole?

39:12.416 --> 39:13.940
We found it.

39:14.018 --> 39:16.282
lt's 20,000 kilometers
off our port bow.

39:16.354 --> 39:18.515
We've determined
that a photon torpedo,

39:18.589 --> 39:21.285
properly calibrated,
will force open the threshold

39:21.359 --> 39:23.486
long enough for Voyager
to get through.

39:23.561 --> 39:26.826
Congratulations, Captain.

39:26.931 --> 39:30.799
For awhile, l wasn't sure
if even you could find it.

39:30.901 --> 39:32.334
Prax.

39:35.473 --> 39:38.772
Go to Cargo Bay 1.

39:38.843 --> 39:40.105
You'll find
the transporter patterns

39:40.177 --> 39:41.735
for more than a dozen telepaths.

39:41.812 --> 39:43.211
Rematerialize them.

39:43.280 --> 39:44.508
Yes, sir.

39:45.683 --> 39:47.844
lmpressive.

39:47.918 --> 39:50.751
You gave
a masterful performance.

39:50.821 --> 39:53.312
l'm the one who's impressed

39:53.391 --> 39:56.883
with your selflessness,
your humanity.

39:57.027 --> 40:00.053
lt made all this so much easier.

40:00.131 --> 40:02.599
Oh, but what about
your selflessness?

40:02.666 --> 40:05.601
That touching story
about the little girl--

40:05.669 --> 40:07.637
was that a fabrication, too?

40:07.705 --> 40:09.502
Oh, that incident was real.

40:09.573 --> 40:11.040
What l didn't tell you

40:11.142 --> 40:13.838
was that after wrestling
with my ethics,

40:13.911 --> 40:16.641
l realized that l'd
done the right thing

40:16.714 --> 40:20.343
in order to protect my people
from a very real threat.

40:20.418 --> 40:21.908
Please.

40:28.025 --> 40:29.720
l insist.

40:58.155 --> 40:59.747
Captain...

41:05.763 --> 41:07.526
Access their forward
sensor array.

41:07.598 --> 41:10.158
You should find
neutrino emissions

41:10.267 --> 41:13.828
at roughly 20,000 kilometers
off the port bow.

41:13.938 --> 41:15.235
On screen.

41:19.109 --> 41:20.406
Target two photon torpedoes.

41:20.478 --> 41:24.574
When the first one detonates,
the wormhole will open.

41:24.648 --> 41:28.049
Use the second one to
destabilize its subspace matrix.

41:28.118 --> 41:30.052
That will destroy it.

41:30.120 --> 41:32.054
Prax, report.

41:32.122 --> 41:34.556
l've isolated the bio-patterns.

41:45.536 --> 41:47.094
Fire.

41:53.210 --> 41:55.804
lt should have detonated.

41:57.147 --> 41:58.774
Those aren't neutrino emissions.

41:58.849 --> 42:00.680
They're antimatter
residue signatures.

42:00.784 --> 42:02.945
There's no wormhole here.

42:05.656 --> 42:07.715
You created false readings.

42:07.791 --> 42:11.158
That is the theme
for this evening, isn't it?

42:12.296 --> 42:15.060
Prax, do you have the telepaths?

42:15.132 --> 42:17.293
l have cargo containers...

42:20.971 --> 42:23.269
filled with vegetables.

42:25.776 --> 42:27.437
Return to the Bridge.

42:27.511 --> 42:29.274
Computer,
change music selection.

42:29.346 --> 42:31.940
Mahler's Symphony #1,
second movement.

42:32.049 --> 42:33.778
Maybe this will help you relax.

42:33.851 --> 42:37.343
lnspector, we've completed
our inventory of the vessel.

42:37.421 --> 42:39.355
Two of their shuttlecraft
are missing.

42:39.423 --> 42:40.890
They couldn't have gone far.

42:40.958 --> 42:43.392
Why didn't they appear
on our long-range scans?

42:43.460 --> 42:44.757
Of course!

42:44.828 --> 42:47.092
Adjust their scanners
to compensate

42:47.164 --> 42:48.927
for refractive shielding.

42:48.999 --> 42:51.194
Well, you gave us
the specifications.

42:51.302 --> 42:53.065
Seemed a shame to waste them.

42:53.170 --> 42:56.003
We've located
the two shuttlecraft.

42:56.073 --> 42:58.439
Range 20 million kilometers.

42:58.509 --> 43:00.704
Order our ships to pursue.

43:00.811 --> 43:02.005
Maximum speed!

43:04.548 --> 43:06.038
We're approaching
the coordinates.

43:06.116 --> 43:07.913
l'm firing the torpedo.

43:22.499 --> 43:24.194
The shuttles have disappeared
from sensors.

43:24.301 --> 43:25.461
We've scanned for a wormhole.

43:25.569 --> 43:28.561
lf there was one, it's gone.

43:29.840 --> 43:32.638
l'll order Janeway
and her crew removed.

43:32.710 --> 43:34.644
We'll confiscate the vessel,

43:34.712 --> 43:37.909
deliver them to the nearest
detention center.

43:37.982 --> 43:39.210
You're dismissed.

43:40.351 --> 43:41.943
lmperative 12, Codicil Six
requires...

43:42.086 --> 43:44.213
To hell with protocol, Prax!

43:44.288 --> 43:46.552
Do you think
either of us will benefit

43:46.624 --> 43:48.683
from having this failure
on our records?

43:48.759 --> 43:52.718
As far as you're concerned,
this incident never occurred.

43:52.796 --> 43:56.288
Make sure your teams share
that understanding.

44:11.015 --> 44:13.745
Well played, Captain.

44:13.817 --> 44:16.684
lt seems l never did
earn your trust.

44:16.754 --> 44:19.052
l had to take a few precautions.

44:19.123 --> 44:20.215
You understand.

44:20.290 --> 44:22.554
Better than anyone.

44:22.626 --> 44:23.820
l never lied to you.

44:23.894 --> 44:26.328
My offer to take you with us
was genuine,

44:26.397 --> 44:27.864
and it would still stand

44:27.931 --> 44:30.331
if you'd kept
your part of the bargain.

44:31.435 --> 44:34.336
For what it's worth...

44:34.405 --> 44:37.897
you made a tempting offer.

44:43.080 --> 44:45.844
The Bridge is yours.
