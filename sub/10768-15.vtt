13:10.670 --> 13:12.300
Oh, shut up.

13:14.240 --> 13:16.140
Boy, am I glad they're gone.

13:16.310 --> 13:17.740
[CHUCKLES]

13:20.580 --> 13:22.520
How do you feel, Will?

13:22.850 --> 13:27.250
Well, you know how they say
a paper cut is the worst kind of pain?

13:27.420 --> 13:30.080
Eh! Eh! Wrong.

13:31.660 --> 13:34.090
You don't have to do that.

13:34.600 --> 13:37.560
- Do what?
- Entertain me.

13:39.930 --> 13:44.800
Did you hear the one about the black dude
that got shot at the ATM?

13:44.970 --> 13:49.500
And how he was trying to be freaky
with his girlfriend in the hospital room?

13:52.450 --> 13:54.000
Stop.

14:06.830 --> 14:08.590
Carlton, look out.

14:10.060 --> 14:11.500
Look out, Carlton.

14:14.570 --> 14:15.830
Will.

14:16.000 --> 14:18.670
Baby, it's okay, wake up.

14:19.070 --> 14:20.900
It's okay.

14:23.010 --> 14:25.380
I'm glad you're here, baby.

14:33.550 --> 14:35.450
[LAUGHING]

14:37.720 --> 14:39.520
Good morning, time for breakfast.

14:39.690 --> 14:40.820
Shh, shh, shh

14:40.990 --> 14:42.430
NURSE:
Oh, sorry.

14:43.930 --> 14:46.830
Isn't it hard to follow that show
with the sound off?

14:47.000 --> 14:51.030
<i>Oh, no, this is What's Happening!!
I know all these jokes by heart.</i>

14:51.200 --> 14:52.830
Oh, check it out, look, look, look.

14:53.010 --> 14:54.970
[IMITATES DWAYNE]
Hey, hey, hey.

14:56.140 --> 14:59.600
[IMITATES DEE]
Oh, Dwayne, Rerun ate my mama's cake.

15:01.250 --> 15:05.050
[IMITATES RERUN] Ooh. Dee, Dee,
please don't tell your mama I ate her cake.

15:05.220 --> 15:08.780
[IMITATES DEE]
Okay, Rerun, for Dee right price.

15:09.390 --> 15:10.650
You're good.

15:10.820 --> 15:13.790
<i>[IN NORMAL VOICE] Oh, that ain't nothing.
You should see my Webster.</i>

15:13.960 --> 15:16.090
What exactly do you want her to see?

15:16.260 --> 15:17.630
[WILL LAUGHS]

15:18.630 --> 15:21.000
Hey, what's up, babe? Are you rested?

15:21.170 --> 15:23.140
Yeah, I must have been tired.

15:23.300 --> 15:26.200
Uh-huh. You was talking
in your sleep last night.

15:26.370 --> 15:29.170
You always dream about Shaka Zulu?

15:29.340 --> 15:30.570
Shut up, Will.

15:30.740 --> 15:31.770
[KNOCKING ON DOOR]

15:33.910 --> 15:36.350
Oh, isn't that nice.

15:36.520 --> 15:41.010
- Would you like me to read the card?
- No, I'll thank Jazz later.

15:41.590 --> 15:44.020
I'll take it. Thanks.

15:46.590 --> 15:49.290
- Hi.
- Carlton.

15:49.730 --> 15:52.490
Hey, what's up, man?
I'm glad you came back.

16:01.010 --> 16:03.910
- Can you show me where I can get coffee?
- Sure, right this way.

16:04.080 --> 16:05.510
Thanks.

16:11.720 --> 16:12.880
[WILL GROANS]

16:15.320 --> 16:18.160
So, what's up, man?
Are you gonna be all right?

16:19.090 --> 16:21.360
Still can't get over it, Will.

16:22.130 --> 16:25.260
If you hadn't pushed me,
that bullet would have gotten me.

16:25.630 --> 16:27.220
Well, not necessarily.

16:27.400 --> 16:29.490
See, even if you stood
right in front of me...

16:29.670 --> 16:32.430
...he still could have hit me
from my belly button up.

16:43.520 --> 16:45.820
I'm totally in your debt, Will.

16:46.190 --> 16:47.850
Pfft. Come on,
you don't owe me nothing.

16:48.020 --> 16:49.580
Yes, I do.

16:50.320 --> 16:54.280
If you ever need anything, anything,
it's yours.

16:55.260 --> 16:56.820
Well, uh...

16:57.060 --> 17:01.400
...you could talk to Uncle Phil about,
you know, sliding me into his will.

17:02.240 --> 17:04.930
Forty, 50 G's, you know?

17:08.510 --> 17:12.000
Actually, my father and I
aren't seeing eye to eye right now.

17:12.310 --> 17:14.780
I feel like everything he's ever said to me
was a lie.

17:15.920 --> 17:18.750
Come on, Carlton, that's a little hard,
don't you think?

17:18.920 --> 17:21.980
I spend my life believing in law and order,
following the rules.

17:22.160 --> 17:25.420
Then some maniac pulls a gun
and all the rules change.

17:25.589 --> 17:28.390
Well, I'm sick of being a follower,
sick of being a victim.

17:28.560 --> 17:31.190
I'm gonna start making some rules.

17:31.570 --> 17:34.000
- Carlton, wait.
- What?

17:34.700 --> 17:37.000
- Give me a hug.
- What?

17:37.400 --> 17:41.500
I said give me a hug, man.
A brother get shot, he get a little emotional.

17:41.680 --> 17:44.110
Now, get over here
and give me some love.

17:46.080 --> 17:47.380
All right.

17:57.720 --> 17:59.120
All right.

18:00.460 --> 18:02.090
What is that?

18:03.030 --> 18:04.720
It's a gun.

18:07.870 --> 18:11.200
Carlton, are you out of your mind?
You're walking around carrying a gun?

18:11.370 --> 18:14.530
- What are you gonna do with that?
- It's for protection.

18:15.610 --> 18:19.840
Carlton. Whoa, man. What, do you think
it's that easy to just shoot somebody?

18:20.750 --> 18:22.910
I'll close my eyes.

18:43.000 --> 18:45.300
I was gonna eat that, man.

18:48.040 --> 18:50.410
Everything's a damn joke to you.

18:53.280 --> 18:57.340
So, what, you don't think I'm mad, huh?

18:57.520 --> 19:01.680
I'm laying up in this hospital
an inch away from being paralyzed.

19:01.860 --> 19:04.050
You don't think I wanna get up
and catch...

19:04.220 --> 19:06.250
It's not gonna happen again, not to me.

19:06.430 --> 19:08.160
Carlton, Carlton.

19:08.330 --> 19:11.320
I understand that you're scared, man...

19:11.500 --> 19:14.230
...but the world can be a scary place.

19:14.400 --> 19:16.370
You just got to learn how to deal with it.

19:16.540 --> 19:18.560
Yeah, well, I found my way.

19:21.010 --> 19:23.870
That's not you, man, that's them.

19:33.350 --> 19:36.080
Look, I didn't come here for your approval,
all right?

19:37.220 --> 19:39.090
I came here to see how you were.

19:42.160 --> 19:43.750
I'm out of here.

19:44.400 --> 19:45.990
Carlton...

19:47.670 --> 19:49.730
No more hugs, Will.

19:50.770 --> 19:53.000
I saved your life, man.

19:53.170 --> 19:55.770
I saved your life. You owe me!

20:00.280 --> 20:03.270
Now, give me the gun, Carlton.

20:07.620 --> 20:11.490
Give me the gun. I saved your life.
I want the gun.
