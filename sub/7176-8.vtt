WEBVTT

02:21.391 --> 02:22.391
Coming!

03:54.651 --> 03:56.944
Stand back!

04:14.004 --> 04:15.546
Close the gate!

04:17.507 --> 04:19.050
Open, sir!

04:30.103 --> 04:32.646
Roland! Roland!

04:33.106 --> 04:35.232
Count Odo.
They are coming.

04:35.317 --> 04:37.068
Tell the men
not to waste
any bolts.

04:37.194 --> 04:38.444
Only when
they're close.
Yes, Count.

04:38.528 --> 04:40.279
Whatever happens,
they must not get
through the gates.

04:40.364 --> 04:42.448
They must not get
into the city.

04:42.532 --> 04:43.574
Do you understand?
Yes.

04:43.658 --> 04:47.078
Whatever we have to
do to stop them will
be done, I assure you.

05:14.856 --> 05:15.815
Pull!

05:44.594 --> 05:45.594
Move!

05:47.013 --> 05:48.889
Hold the line!

06:19.713 --> 06:22.465
Bring the cage
and the ram!

06:40.233 --> 06:41.484
Halt!

06:46.072 --> 06:47.990
Archers, cover us.

06:51.620 --> 06:52.828
Shield wall!

06:58.877 --> 07:00.669
Wait for my signal!

08:17.706 --> 08:19.123
Forward!

08:55.619 --> 08:57.202
Brace the gates!

10:34.217 --> 10:35.217
Stop!

10:43.852 --> 10:46.395
Erlendur,
bring the tools!

11:13.339 --> 11:16.842
Thor, come on!
Get up! Get up!

11:50.627 --> 11:54.713
Come on! All of you! Go!

11:57.300 --> 11:58.634
Up!

13:00.363 --> 13:01.738
The Oriflamme.

13:02.240 --> 13:04.825
It is the sacred
banner of Saint-Denis.

13:05.827 --> 13:08.287
The cloth was bathed
in his blood.

13:10.540 --> 13:11.874
Martyr's blood.

13:12.125 --> 13:13.458
Yes.

13:14.752 --> 13:18.255
In defense of which
you and all your Order
would gladly die.

13:18.840 --> 13:19.882
Yes.

13:22.093 --> 13:26.054
And so it will be
for all of Paris.

13:38.151 --> 13:40.527
Monseigneur. Monseigneur.

13:42.405 --> 13:44.239
What is this?
The Oriflamme.

13:44.324 --> 13:47.159
The sacred banner
of Saint-Denis,
dipped in his blood.

13:47.243 --> 13:49.328
Bless it, Monseigneur.
Anoint it!

13:49.412 --> 13:50.412
Believe in it.

13:51.080 --> 13:52.331
- I'm not sure...
- Do it!

13:52.916 --> 13:55.417
Do it now if you
care for Paris.

14:09.974 --> 14:11.308
Count Odo!

14:11.768 --> 14:13.685
Count Odo!
What is it?

14:14.562 --> 14:15.646
Sir, they are breaching
the walls.

14:23.446 --> 14:25.739
Cut the ropes! Cut the ropes!

14:29.827 --> 14:32.537
Now! Climb!

15:05.738 --> 15:06.989
Close the front gate.

15:29.846 --> 15:33.015
Soldiers! Citizens of Paris!

15:33.683 --> 15:35.934
Behold the Oriflamme.

15:36.019 --> 15:38.603
Behold the sacred
flag of Saint-Denis.

15:38.938 --> 15:41.898
Behold the sacred
flag of Frankia.

15:42.150 --> 15:44.484
Behold, soldiers of Christ.

15:44.902 --> 15:45.902
That wherever
the Oriflamme is,

15:45.987 --> 15:48.697
no quarter is to be
given to our enemies.

15:49.449 --> 15:53.035
Soldiers, show no mercy.

15:53.202 --> 15:54.161
Fight on!

15:55.913 --> 15:56.913
Fight to the death!

16:28.571 --> 16:29.905
Prepare the oil.

16:49.050 --> 16:51.510
Siegfried, the horses!

17:18.287 --> 17:19.955
Kalf, the ropes!

18:25.188 --> 18:26.479
Climb!

18:27.023 --> 18:28.398
Climb!

18:31.110 --> 18:32.110
Coward!

18:33.571 --> 18:34.905
Get up the tower!

18:36.115 --> 18:37.115
Go on!

18:39.410 --> 18:40.577
Come on, climb!

20:33.649 --> 20:34.941
Pull!

21:24.742 --> 21:25.742
Lagertha, stop.

21:26.869 --> 21:28.036
Lagertha, stop!
What?

21:28.621 --> 21:29.913
What?

21:29.997 --> 21:31.039
What are you doing?
Wait.

22:33.811 --> 22:36.896
Up! Quickly! Get up!

23:06.969 --> 23:08.386
Where are you going?

23:08.470 --> 23:09.971
Huh?
We should fall back.

23:10.806 --> 23:11.973
Valhalla is that way!

27:57.467 --> 27:58.593
Mercy.

30:06.430 --> 30:08.806
Now that I see them up close,

30:09.433 --> 30:12.351
they seem so much less
frightening than I supposed.

30:17.274 --> 30:18.316
Indeed,

30:18.400 --> 30:20.568
they appear almost human.

31:28.470 --> 31:31.389
Your Imperial Highness
is to be congratulated

31:31.473 --> 31:34.725
for the brave and stout
defense of our great city.

31:35.852 --> 31:38.145
All hail the Emperor!

31:38.772 --> 31:42.274
Hail the Emperor!
Hail the Emperor!

34:08.255 --> 34:10.047
Siggy.

34:27.482 --> 34:28.607
Is he alive?

34:29.401 --> 34:30.859
They told me the news.

34:32.946 --> 34:36.240
Is he dying?
Is my son dying?
I don't know.

34:42.289 --> 34:43.455
What happened?

34:43.540 --> 34:46.625
He was proving that
you don't need a title
to be a leader.

34:56.678 --> 34:58.721
You should never have
let him climb the ladder.

34:59.014 --> 35:00.389
Now he may die.

35:00.849 --> 35:04.018
Both of you
stop treating him
like a child.

35:04.102 --> 35:07.021
He's a man,
so let him be one.

35:08.648 --> 35:12.192
Today we came so close.

35:12.777 --> 35:15.863
Next time, we will not
make the same mistakes.

35:49.648 --> 35:51.065
What are you doing?

35:53.443 --> 35:54.735
Helga...

35:55.403 --> 35:57.237
What are you doing here?

35:58.323 --> 36:00.741
I can't bear
to face the others.

36:01.201 --> 36:02.701
Why?

36:04.245 --> 36:07.081
Because all of this
disaster is my fault.

36:08.792 --> 36:11.877
For their own reasons,
the gods have decided
to punish me.

36:12.587 --> 36:14.588
And I don't understand.

36:15.215 --> 36:16.632
Everything I did,

36:17.342 --> 36:20.094
everything I have done,
I did for them.

36:20.261 --> 36:22.596
This is not all about you!

36:23.598 --> 36:25.265
Don't be angry with me.

36:26.226 --> 36:28.727
Please don't be
angry with me.
Why not?

36:29.521 --> 36:32.272
How am I supposed to live,
knowing what I know?

36:33.024 --> 36:35.234
You don't think of
anybody but yourself.

36:35.860 --> 36:39.363
That's not true!
That's not true, Helga.

36:40.323 --> 36:42.658
I think about all of us.

36:42.784 --> 36:45.786
I think about every
human being in Midgard.

36:48.164 --> 36:50.082
Helga, don't go.

36:50.625 --> 36:51.792
Helga,
don't leave me.

36:54.170 --> 36:55.838
Helga, come back.

36:56.798 --> 36:59.133
Helga, come back!

37:00.135 --> 37:01.468
Helga!

37:20.488 --> 37:21.572
How are you?

37:22.407 --> 37:23.532
Alive.

37:48.183 --> 37:50.017
You want to hate me,

37:51.144 --> 37:52.269
but you can't.

37:53.521 --> 37:54.855
Can't I?

38:02.030 --> 38:03.197
All I know

38:06.242 --> 38:10.537
is that I desire you
with all my heart.

38:12.373 --> 38:14.041
I want to be with you.

38:28.556 --> 38:30.098
How could I believe you?

38:31.142 --> 38:32.643
I could have let you die.

38:36.981 --> 38:39.733
What if I accept
what you have to say?

38:40.318 --> 38:44.071
What if I agree
to be with you

38:44.155 --> 38:46.156
and go with you?

38:50.411 --> 38:52.246
But I will never
forgive you

38:52.330 --> 38:54.706
for usurping my Earldom.

38:54.791 --> 38:58.252
And one day, I will kill you.

39:05.260 --> 39:09.012
If you accept
that condition,

39:12.517 --> 39:14.935
then let us be together

39:19.566 --> 39:21.275
and enjoy each other.

39:54.809 --> 39:56.268
You see?

39:57.687 --> 39:59.146
You should never have
called me that.

40:01.691 --> 40:02.983
Called you what?

40:03.776 --> 40:05.110
Ironside.

40:06.904 --> 40:10.157
As if the gods
are protecting me.

40:10.783 --> 40:11.783
Go.

40:20.335 --> 40:22.002
You're alive, aren't you?

40:25.089 --> 40:26.840
Today went badly.

40:28.926 --> 40:30.427
Yes, it did.

40:35.558 --> 40:37.517
You led today.

40:41.814 --> 40:44.524
I only did
what my instincts
told me to do.

40:47.987 --> 40:49.529
Well, that is a start.

40:52.200 --> 40:53.700
What are we going to do?

40:58.289 --> 41:03.251
Before I decide
I must speak with
an old friend.

41:17.350 --> 41:19.309
Athelstan.

41:20.395 --> 41:22.312
I hope you can
hear me, Athelstan,

41:23.231 --> 41:25.065
and I'm not just
talking to myself.

41:36.911 --> 41:38.036
What?

41:40.164 --> 41:42.332
Do you think I went
too far with Floki?

41:48.172 --> 41:50.048
Can you actually
believe that he thought

41:50.133 --> 41:53.093
I would let him
lead without my
having an agenda?

41:57.932 --> 42:01.935
If I was him, I would
worry less about the gods

42:02.019 --> 42:05.230
and more about the
fury of a patient man.

42:06.899 --> 42:08.358
And as well you know,

42:08.443 --> 42:10.485
I can be very patient.

42:28.254 --> 42:29.755
I wish you were here.

42:33.926 --> 42:36.970
Paris is everything
you told me it would be.

42:41.434 --> 42:49.399
And I am bound and
determined to conquer it.
