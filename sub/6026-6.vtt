WEBVTT

00:17.120 --> 00:19.327
Pardon me, is that seat taken?

00:19.400 --> 00:21.641
Gavin.

00:21.720 --> 00:23.051
Classic Gavin.

00:23.600 --> 00:25.443
Let's hope this sucks.

00:25.520 --> 00:28.000
Oh, good. Monica
made it just in time.

00:28.080 --> 00:31.562
Carla, looks like you won't be
the only woman in the house for a change.

00:31.640 --> 00:32.720
Christ.

00:33.440 --> 00:35.408
One thing worse than being
the only woman in a company

00:35.480 --> 00:37.926
- is being one of only two.
- Why's that?

00:38.000 --> 00:40.321
Everybody puts this super-weird
pressure on you to be friends.

00:40.400 --> 00:42.562
- It's creepy.
- Hey, did I miss it?

00:42.640 --> 00:43.926
- No.
- Good.

00:44.800 --> 00:48.043
Monica, I'd like to introduce you to Carla.

00:48.120 --> 00:50.566
Carla, Monica.

00:50.640 --> 00:52.483
Monica, Carla.

00:53.480 --> 00:55.050
- What's up?
- Nice to meet you.

00:55.120 --> 00:57.043
I knew you two would hit it off.

00:57.880 --> 00:59.962
Hey. Monica?

01:00.080 --> 01:01.081
It's starting.

01:01.160 --> 01:03.128
ANNOUNCER". Tonight, for
the first time ever,

01:03.200 --> 01:06.488
streaming live in 4K resolution
over the Internet,

01:06.560 --> 01:09.325
UFC Fight Night, powered by Nucleus!

01:09.400 --> 01:12.404
No networks. No more middleman.
No bullshit.

01:12.480 --> 01:14.369
We're bringing the fight
straight to the fans.

01:14.440 --> 01:18.570
We're cutting the cord forever
with UFC Fight Pass, powered by Nucleus.

01:19.040 --> 01:22.761
Tonight, you'll get Ultimate Fighting
at the ultimate resolution.

01:22.840 --> 01:25.241
Nucleus puts 4K UHD video

01:25.320 --> 01:27.607
in a lossless compression chokehold

01:27.680 --> 01:29.887
and forces the competition to tap out.

01:35.880 --> 01:37.405
On!

01:37.480 --> 01:38.561
Who's douchebag?

01:38.640 --> 01:40.404
He sure likes to break stuff.

01:44.200 --> 01:46.123
We are live in Las Vegas.

01:46.200 --> 01:48.248
The picture looks amazing.

01:48.320 --> 01:51.290
Man, Joe, this is a fight
we have been looking forward to

01:51.360 --> 01:53.124
for a long, long time.

01:53.200 --> 01:55.282
Are we getting a contact high off Erlich,

01:55.360 --> 01:57.044
or is the edge starting to warble?

01:57.120 --> 02:00.044
No, I see it. Are they
converting down to 24 frames?

02:01.760 --> 02:03.250
The defense so far. Wow!

02:03.600 --> 02:05.648
The jerkiness is not a
Nucleus issue, right?

02:05.720 --> 02:07.688
I mean, it's not going out
to the world like that, is it?

02:07.760 --> 02:08.806
I think it looks great.

02:08.880 --> 02:11.406
You see that frame judder
as the camera pans?

02:11.480 --> 02:14.689
The picture's so blocky.
It looks like Minecraft.

02:14.760 --> 02:17.081
It doesn't make sense.
It's supposed to be totally lossless.

02:17.560 --> 02:19.244
Let me dump their bit stream
to disk and take a look.

02:19.320 --> 02:21.163
She's really smart.

02:21.640 --> 02:23.165
But not afraid to be bawdy.

02:25.880 --> 02:28.360
- Oh, my God.
- They are so fucked.

02:28.720 --> 02:29.926
Yeah, this is bad.

02:31.160 --> 02:32.571
Attack with the left!

02:32.640 --> 02:34.608
He's hurt! With the right! He's down!

02:34.680 --> 02:35.806
He's hit! Oh!

02:36.080 --> 02:37.491
It's frozen.

02:37.760 --> 02:39.330
- It's frozen.
- Oh, my goodness!

02:39.600 --> 02:41.329
It is all over!

02:41.400 --> 02:43.050
Unbelievable!

02:43.120 --> 02:47.523
I have never, in all my years
of watching fighting,

02:47.600 --> 02:51.764
seen a finishing combination
more ferocious!

02:51.960 --> 02:54.691
What a spectacular finish by Molina!

02:54.760 --> 02:57.525
We're being told
that the Nucleus live stream...

02:57.600 --> 03:00.410
- Fuck!
- ...may have cut out during that exchange.

03:00.480 --> 03:03.370
If that is true, what a travesty!

03:03.440 --> 03:04.521
Fuck!

03:04.600 --> 03:05.601
Joe, you're absolutely right.

03:16.240 --> 03:18.925
Gavin Belson just shit everyone's pants.

03:19.280 --> 03:20.327
He sure did.

03:20.400 --> 03:22.687
The encoding is totally underpowered
to cover up their defects.

03:23.080 --> 03:26.129
Nucleus just can't keep up
with 4K live stream yet.

03:26.200 --> 03:29.409
Hey. Could Pied Piper handle live 4K video?

03:29.520 --> 03:32.683
I could deploy a live video stream that
would be way better than theirs right now.

03:32.960 --> 03:36.362
Jump on it. Now.
Like, do our own live stream.

03:36.440 --> 03:37.726
Partner with someone like Gavin did.

03:37.800 --> 03:39.086
Look at you two.

03:40.120 --> 03:43.169
Hold on. Live streaming's not really
our primary business here.

03:43.240 --> 03:46.449
Yeah, but beating Nucleus is.
The blogs would go nuts.

03:46.520 --> 03:47.885
We're built for it on my end.

03:47.960 --> 03:50.201
I mean, if it's just me
hosting seeds and manifests,

03:50.280 --> 03:51.850
I'm good on my end.

03:51.960 --> 03:54.884
I'm prepared to brag about it
and release some publicity.

03:54.960 --> 03:57.645
Well, peer-to-peer delivery
is good to go here. Just let me know.

03:58.080 --> 04:00.924
Oh, Carla, do you want to
show Monica your work station?

04:01.000 --> 04:02.240
No thanks.

04:04.240 --> 04:08.404
Okay, but Hooli had a deal
with UFC that would stream a fight.

04:08.480 --> 04:10.130
I mean, what do we even do?

04:10.200 --> 04:11.611
Don't really have a lot of time here.

04:11.680 --> 04:13.205
That's real.

04:13.560 --> 04:16.291
We could find an event
that's already in motion.

04:16.519 --> 04:17.726
Can I make a suggestion?

04:17.800 --> 04:21.088
There is a nesting pair
of California condors

04:21.160 --> 04:23.686
on the closed-circuit feed
at the Natural History Museum.

04:23.880 --> 04:27.009
There's an egg in the nest right now.
It's very compelling.

04:27.120 --> 04:29.361
Why don't we just live
stream me killing you?

04:29.440 --> 04:30.601
I wouldn't be so dismissive.

04:30.680 --> 04:34.162
There was a live stream of an eagle's nest
last year that went viral,

04:34.240 --> 04:35.571
and was getting millions of hits.

04:35.640 --> 04:37.449
And I don't wanna be inflammatory,

04:37.520 --> 04:40.808
but next to a condor, an
eagle looks like a...

04:40.880 --> 04:42.006
Common cackling.

04:42.080 --> 04:44.606
Fuck that, Jared. I've got it.

04:44.720 --> 04:46.882
I'm very good friends with Aaron Anderson.

04:47.720 --> 04:50.200
Double-A? The guy who
owns Homicide Energy Drink?

04:50.280 --> 04:53.887
Uh, is Homicide
the extra douchey energy drink?

04:53.960 --> 04:55.086
It sure is.

04:55.160 --> 04:58.084
There's a bunch of stunts
and crazy shit on here.

04:58.160 --> 05:02.529
That video player quality is terrible.
It's a perfect candidate.

05:02.600 --> 05:05.524
And Double-A loves me.
He'd definitely hook us up.

05:05.600 --> 05:07.648
How do you know him?

05:07.720 --> 05:11.088
From college.
He was a sophomore when I was a senior.

05:11.160 --> 05:13.162
He and his roommates
used to live down the hall.

05:13.240 --> 05:15.402
I used to party in their room all the time.

05:15.480 --> 05:18.245
Uh, kind of a mentor-mentee sort of thing.

05:18.680 --> 05:20.682
Coming from a manatee sort of thing.

05:21.120 --> 05:24.647
You look like a ferret that gave up
on himself six months ago, Gilfoyle.

05:24.760 --> 05:27.366
- I'm going to ping Double-A.
- Wait.

05:27.440 --> 05:29.249
What if he says yes?

05:29.320 --> 05:32.130
You know? Are we really gonna
drop everything to do this?

05:32.200 --> 05:33.247
What if we don't get it right?

05:33.720 --> 05:36.610
I mean, it could hurt us
just like it hurt them.

05:37.120 --> 05:38.929
Shit. I don't know.

05:39.480 --> 05:40.766
Now, this is critical, Richard.

05:40.840 --> 05:42.842
Maybe we should SWOT this decision.

05:42.920 --> 05:44.968
I don't know what that is, but no.

05:45.040 --> 05:46.530
- SWOT analysis.
- No.

05:46.600 --> 05:48.682
S-W-O-T? No?

05:48.760 --> 05:49.966
Holy cow.

05:50.040 --> 05:52.691
Did he really just say "holy cow"?

05:52.760 --> 05:55.684
I've had a board ready
for just such an occasion.

05:55.760 --> 05:58.684
I've booby-trapped the house
with corporate resources.

06:02.000 --> 06:04.810
SWOT is a way of evaluating a decision.

06:05.360 --> 06:07.966
And you just break it
down into "strengths,"

06:08.040 --> 06:10.805
"weaknesses," "opportunities,"
and "threats."

06:11.280 --> 06:12.725
You're fucking joking.

06:12.800 --> 06:14.006
Not at all.

06:14.080 --> 06:17.971
You can SWOT a concept,
a department, or a new initiative.

06:18.040 --> 06:19.371
You can even SWOT a person.

06:19.480 --> 06:21.801
Although you have to be careful,
they might SWOT you back.

06:21.880 --> 06:23.564
- I wanna SWOT you.
- Well, you can.

06:23.640 --> 06:25.210
Because now you have the tools.

06:25.320 --> 06:28.051
Okay. Um, shout them out
and I'll tack them up.

06:28.120 --> 06:30.646
Jared, I'm... I'm really
sorry, but I have to go.

06:31.160 --> 06:33.128
You know, would it make more sense
if I worked something up

06:33.200 --> 06:35.806
and then I got back to you guys, and...

06:36.160 --> 06:38.322
Okay, great. I'm on it.

06:39.840 --> 06:42.923
People love condors.

06:44.440 --> 06:45.441
Strengths.

06:45.520 --> 06:49.127
On top of the roof,
Blaine is gonna launch off this ramp.

06:49.600 --> 06:50.761
It's pretty gnarly.

06:50.840 --> 06:54.208
If everything goes right,
he'll fly over the street

06:54.280 --> 06:56.601
and land on this 15-story building here.

06:56.680 --> 06:59.524
We've got 27 cameras, a couple in the car.

06:59.600 --> 07:01.443
Feed a live edit back
here to the data center.

07:01.520 --> 07:03.921
We put everything through
your incredible compression, Richard,

07:04.120 --> 07:05.326
and up onto the web.

07:05.640 --> 07:06.766
So, what do you think, Richard?

07:06.840 --> 07:10.128
I think this is awesome, Double-A.

07:10.240 --> 07:11.765
I mean, it is incredible.

07:11.840 --> 07:15.686
You really have built
a giant monument to awesomeness.

07:15.760 --> 07:17.808
I think my aid in helping you achieve this

07:17.880 --> 07:20.611
is what inspired me
to start my own incubator.

07:20.680 --> 07:23.411
Uh, so, Richard, you ready for this?

07:23.480 --> 07:24.970
Oh, yeah. I think so. Yeah...

07:25.040 --> 07:27.008
Double-A, we are psyched.

07:27.080 --> 07:29.560
And we can do whatever you need.

07:29.640 --> 07:30.971
Okay, thanks, Kool-Aid.

07:31.040 --> 07:33.168
Kool-Aid? What's that? Are you Kool-Aid?

07:33.240 --> 07:34.924
Yeah, it's just a term of endearment.

07:35.000 --> 07:37.606
You know, nickname. That's how we
used to rock it back in the day

07:37.680 --> 07:39.842
'cause I was cool and supportive.

07:39.920 --> 07:43.003
Yeah. Oh hey, guys, this is Gina,
she's one of our event managers.

07:43.080 --> 07:46.766
Hey, Gina, can you take Dinesh
and Gilfoyle to the data center, please?

07:46.840 --> 07:48.490
Sure. You wanna follow me?

07:48.560 --> 07:50.688
Only if we get hats, Gina.

07:50.760 --> 07:52.364
You can just take mine.

07:54.800 --> 07:56.609
Did you see that? She gave me her hat.

07:56.680 --> 07:59.160
Pretend you've seen a woman before.

07:59.240 --> 08:00.730
Are those Homicide drinks for free?

08:00.800 --> 08:02.484
Uh, yeah. Knock yourself out.

08:02.560 --> 08:03.925
Homicide!

08:07.720 --> 08:11.725
Is there any way that it could be maybe
more like just you and me talking,

08:11.800 --> 08:13.245
and not Erlich?

08:13.720 --> 08:16.849
What do you mean? Aren't you guys friends?
I thought you go way back.

08:16.920 --> 08:18.251
We do. But...

08:19.440 --> 08:21.283
To be honest, I could never stand the guy.

08:22.400 --> 08:25.609
I mean, just hearing his voice
again is giving me PTSD.

08:26.440 --> 08:28.727
Right. But you just called him cool.

08:28.800 --> 08:32.441
- No, I called him Kool-Aid. We all did.
- Right.

08:32.520 --> 08:35.000
Because he's like
the Kool-Aid pitcher from the ads.

08:35.080 --> 08:36.969
As in, every fucking time
we were hanging out without him,

08:37.039 --> 08:38.530
he would come smashing through a wall.

08:38.600 --> 08:39.806
But you still hung outwith him.

08:39.880 --> 08:42.850
Yeah, 'cause we were 19,
and he had weed and beer.

08:42.919 --> 08:44.809
But even drunk and high I couldn't take it.

08:44.920 --> 08:48.242
I mean, it's like he's fucking allergic
to letting other people talk.

08:48.320 --> 08:49.890
It's like he's always gotta
say something. You know?

08:49.960 --> 08:51.291
Hey, Richard.

08:52.680 --> 08:54.284
Homicide!

08:57.120 --> 08:59.168
So, Dinesh, I have a question.

08:59.240 --> 09:02.926
You're obviously Pakistani,
but the name Dinesh is Indian, isn't it?

09:03.000 --> 09:05.480
Yeah. Wow. That's exactly right.

09:05.840 --> 09:07.922
You know, most people, ignorant people,

09:08.000 --> 09:10.367
don't even know
those are two separate countries.

09:10.440 --> 09:12.442
And they don't care either.

09:13.720 --> 09:16.121
- How do you know about my name?
- I'm an Army brat.

09:16.240 --> 09:18.083
My dad was stationed in Karachi
when I was a kid.

09:18.200 --> 09:21.409
It was a beautiful place,
full of beautiful people.

09:21.800 --> 09:23.404
Kind of like this room, right?

09:23.480 --> 09:25.403
Oh... Oh!

09:25.480 --> 09:26.720
Hold on a sec. I'll be right back.

09:26.800 --> 09:29.167
- Don't take too long.
- Ew.

09:31.840 --> 09:34.002
This is awesome.
I don't know if it's what's in this,

09:34.080 --> 09:36.447
but I, like... I've, like,
all these killer lines coming to me.

09:36.520 --> 09:39.171
I'm on fucking fire right now. Oh!

09:39.240 --> 09:40.480
She likes me, right?

09:41.640 --> 09:43.005
Yeah, she's totally into you.

09:43.640 --> 09:47.008
Just not as into you
as she is into that guy's mouth.

09:49.320 --> 09:51.926
He's definitely gonna fuck her later,
and she's not gonna think of you

09:52.000 --> 09:53.126
while it's happening.

09:53.200 --> 09:55.441
God damn it. Fuck.

09:56.640 --> 09:59.689
Now I'm just shaking.
What do they put in this shit?

10:00.440 --> 10:01.930
Milk thistle?

10:03.200 --> 10:04.690
'. Guys! Come out here!

10:05.720 --> 10:07.404
Juliet calls.

10:10.400 --> 10:12.641
Guys, this is Blaine.

10:12.720 --> 10:14.324
He's the guy doing the stunt.

10:14.400 --> 10:18.405
Blaine, these are the genius coders
who are helping us with the live stream.

10:18.480 --> 10:21.131
- They're rock stars.
- Okay.

10:21.720 --> 10:25.247
- So this is the car you're jumping?
- Yes, it is.

10:25.320 --> 10:27.368
And that's what your
ramp's gonna look like?

10:28.040 --> 10:30.611
- Yeah.
- Cool. Well, have you...

10:30.680 --> 10:33.047
Yeah, and because
I know that you're gonna ask,

10:33.120 --> 10:34.724
yes, I've done this before.

10:34.800 --> 10:37.451
And yes, it's fucking dangerous.

10:38.440 --> 10:41.762
Listen, I got a lot of work
to do to get this right.

10:41.840 --> 10:43.171
Okay?

10:45.560 --> 10:46.891
Okay.

10:48.560 --> 10:50.847
Hey, you see what I saw?

10:50.960 --> 10:53.850
Yeah, I saw.
He's got the velocity calculated wrong.

10:53.920 --> 10:56.890
It's for a flat plane. He doesn't
account for the curve in the ramp.

10:56.960 --> 10:59.770
Exactly. He's probably
used to doing straight ramps.

10:59.840 --> 11:02.764
I mean, the chart says he's gonna
launch at 81 miles per hour,

11:02.840 --> 11:04.649
- but it's going to be more like...
- Under 70.

11:05.320 --> 11:06.765
The downforce is ridiculous.

11:06.840 --> 11:09.605
He's gonna lose speed
and hit the side of that wall.

11:10.320 --> 11:12.607
- And die.
- So we should probably...

11:14.440 --> 11:16.090
Okay. All right.

11:18.160 --> 11:19.969
Hey, uh, Blaine?

11:21.120 --> 11:22.531
- One small thing.
- No.

11:22.600 --> 11:23.840
I'm gonna stop you right there, Glasses.

11:23.920 --> 11:27.083
'Cause I told you once already,
and I was very clear.

11:27.160 --> 11:30.448
I am too fucking busy to deal with you.

11:31.480 --> 11:34.529
Okay? I'm just being cool here.

11:34.600 --> 11:35.886
All right?

11:38.560 --> 11:40.642
What do we do here?

11:40.760 --> 11:42.250
This is a tough one.

11:43.000 --> 11:45.844
So, Richard, in terms of a player window,
what do you see?

11:45.920 --> 11:48.526
- Well, um, I think it's pretty straightforward.
- I'll handle this, Richard.

11:48.600 --> 11:50.921
- You don't have to.
- The whole reason we're doing this, friend,

11:51.000 --> 11:52.206
is for branding value.

11:52.280 --> 11:54.408
So we're gonna need a banner that says

11:54.480 --> 11:56.687
"Powered by Pied Piper"
underneath the video window.

11:56.760 --> 12:00.048
It doesn't have to be too big, but you
don't want it to be too small either.

12:00.120 --> 12:03.249
Although, there's nothing
small about Homicide, Double-A.

12:03.320 --> 12:04.810
At least as far as I can tell.

12:04.880 --> 12:07.690
Also, if it's, if it's
possible, what we'd like to...

12:07.760 --> 12:09.125
Let me stop you right there, Richard.

12:09.800 --> 12:14.328
We're gonna need to have our logos
on the car, Blaine's suit, his helmet.

12:14.400 --> 12:17.449
If he wants to get a Flash tattoo
or something on his neck,

12:17.520 --> 12:18.646
that's on him.

12:20.280 --> 12:22.442
Actually, um, in all honesty,

12:22.520 --> 12:25.251
Erlich just pretty much said
exactly what I was gonna say. Um...

12:25.320 --> 12:26.560
Uh-huh. Um...

12:26.680 --> 12:28.205
So, Richard...

12:28.280 --> 12:29.406
- Yes?
- Yeah?

12:29.480 --> 12:32.882
Do you think you can
make the preview window full resolution?

12:33.520 --> 12:35.010
- Richard can give you whatever you need.
- Yes...

12:35.080 --> 12:36.923
But as far as the video player goes...

12:37.000 --> 12:42.370
Guys, I'm sorry. I just remembered
that I've got somewhere else to be.

12:43.800 --> 12:45.768
All right. Well, Double-A,
I'll see you soon.

12:45.840 --> 12:48.605
I'm just gonna grab a shirt
and we'll check you later.

12:48.680 --> 12:51.650
What the fuck, dude?
Hey, I love your tech.

12:51.720 --> 12:54.724
But come back tomorrow without Kool-Aid,
or don't come back at all.

12:54.800 --> 12:55.926
Honestly.

13:01.960 --> 13:05.009
- Richard, what's going on?
- What do you mean?

13:05.080 --> 13:07.481
I'm catching kind of a vibe.

13:08.200 --> 13:11.044
A weird vibe with you and Double-A.

13:11.120 --> 13:12.645
Right. That. Well...

13:12.720 --> 13:15.291
I'm not gonna sugarcoat it, Richard.
I don't think he likes you.

13:15.720 --> 13:18.564
I mean, he literally
rolled his eyes at you.

13:19.920 --> 13:21.888
Why don't you just trust me on this one?

13:21.960 --> 13:24.406
Let Kool-Aid do the talking tomorrow.

13:25.960 --> 13:28.327
Take this stuff.
I'm gonna grab a couple more drinks

13:28.400 --> 13:29.561
and another hat.

13:29.640 --> 13:31.085
I'm gonna get a box.

13:31.800 --> 13:33.643
This is a total fucking disaster.

13:33.720 --> 13:35.404
If my engineers had just
told me they weren't ready,

13:35.480 --> 13:37.721
I never would have
pushed for this live stream.

13:37.800 --> 13:41.441
Even worse, now I hear
those little Pied Piper fuckers

13:41.520 --> 13:44.251
are doing their own live stream
with Homicide.

13:45.400 --> 13:47.289
- The energy drink?
- Yes.

13:47.360 --> 13:49.681
Meanwhile, I've demanded
to see internal testing

13:49.760 --> 13:52.047
from every facet of the Nucleus platform.

13:52.120 --> 13:54.885
So I can see for myself where I stand.

13:54.960 --> 13:58.567
Because all I hear
from everybody is good news.

13:58.640 --> 14:00.847
Have I just surrounded myself
with sycophants,

14:00.920 --> 14:03.366
who are just telling me
whatever I want to hear,

14:03.440 --> 14:05.249
regardless of the truth?

14:08.520 --> 14:09.726
No.

14:11.960 --> 14:14.884
Thank you, Denpok.
I really needed to hear that.

14:16.760 --> 14:20.242
This might be morbid,
but the cold, hard fact is

14:20.320 --> 14:23.529
that if Blaine dies on our live stream,
this could be good for us.

14:23.600 --> 14:26.524
I mean, we'd get a lot more traffic.

14:26.600 --> 14:30.082
Well, and it would probably lead to calls
for regulations in the stunt industry.

14:30.160 --> 14:33.642
So, in the long term, we're saving lives.

14:36.440 --> 14:39.728
Although, there is the moral problem
with letting him die.

14:40.520 --> 14:42.488
Though he did tell us to shut up.

14:43.080 --> 14:44.525
And his name is Blaine.

14:45.320 --> 14:47.448
And Gina is super hot.

14:48.400 --> 14:50.289
And this would make her single.

14:51.800 --> 14:56.089
She'd probably need consoling,
so there's an opportunity.

14:56.160 --> 14:57.491
Opportunity.

14:58.520 --> 15:00.329
Should we SWOT this?

15:04.920 --> 15:07.366
Bereaved women do tend to act out sexually.

15:07.440 --> 15:09.169
Yeah, so that's a strength.

15:09.240 --> 15:12.210
- Hey, Kool-Aid!
- Yeah!

15:16.000 --> 15:17.206
And? So?

15:18.080 --> 15:19.764
And? It...

15:20.480 --> 15:22.608
it wasn't meant to be a
flattering nickname.

15:22.680 --> 15:24.250
It was an insult.

15:24.360 --> 15:26.089
I'm not sure I agree with that.

15:26.160 --> 15:29.084
I mean, the dancing pitcher
breaks through walls

15:29.160 --> 15:32.004
to give tasty beverages to kids in need.

15:32.080 --> 15:35.368
Why would you infer from this
that Double-A doesn't like me?

15:35.440 --> 15:39.411
Well, um, I wasn't inferring anything.

15:39.480 --> 15:42.051
He told me to my face
that he doesn't like you.

15:42.120 --> 15:43.770
But why wouldn't he like me?

15:44.240 --> 15:46.004
Well, uh...

15:46.080 --> 15:48.811
You have a tendency sometimes to...

15:48.880 --> 15:50.803
Why on earth wouldn't he like me?

15:50.880 --> 15:54.123
Because, Erlich, you tend to not let...

15:54.200 --> 15:56.202
I was his mentor. You know?

15:56.280 --> 15:58.282
You know, there's no remote possibility...

15:58.360 --> 16:00.203
Because you don't let people talk!

16:00.880 --> 16:02.291
It just happened.

16:02.360 --> 16:03.361
Um...

16:04.200 --> 16:05.645
And he told me that if you came tomorrow

16:05.720 --> 16:08.849
that he would pull the plug
on the whole live stream, so...

16:12.560 --> 16:13.800
I see.

16:14.520 --> 16:15.646
Sorry.

16:15.720 --> 16:17.722
Are you done talking now?

16:19.920 --> 16:21.046
Yes.

16:21.560 --> 16:24.166
Do Dinesh and Gilfoyle know about this?

16:24.800 --> 16:27.565
- No, I came straight to you.
- What about Jared?

16:28.640 --> 16:29.721
Nope.

16:30.160 --> 16:31.889
Okay, here's what you need to do.

16:31.960 --> 16:35.931
You need to go in tomorrow,
and you need to do that live stream.

16:36.880 --> 16:40.566
And put my feelings aside,
you know, don't quit on account of me.

16:41.040 --> 16:43.327
I wasn't gonna... I wasn't gonna quit.

16:43.400 --> 16:45.971
There is something you should know, though.

16:47.760 --> 16:50.889
Aaron Anderson wasn't
very well liked in college.

16:50.960 --> 16:53.645
In fact, people used to
call him Double-Asshole.

16:55.600 --> 16:57.364
So watch out for that guy.

16:59.800 --> 17:01.484
Are you sure you're okay with this?

17:01.920 --> 17:05.163
Yes, Richard.
It's time for me to be the bigger man.

17:05.240 --> 17:06.730
The cooler man.

17:07.359 --> 17:09.681
I am Kool-Aid, after all.

17:15.040 --> 17:18.761
Ladies and gentlemen, for the last 90
minutes you have had an opportunity

17:18.839 --> 17:22.640
to explore a standard Hooliphone
upgraded with a brand new operating system

17:22.720 --> 17:23.881
called Nucleus.

17:23.960 --> 17:25.040
Thank you all for being here,

17:25.119 --> 17:28.567
Allen, Lisa, Josh, Yana, Katie, Ramén.

17:29.000 --> 17:31.207
I'd like to get everyone's
first impressions.

17:31.320 --> 17:33.687
Who'd like to jump in? Anyone?

17:35.760 --> 17:37.364
How about you, Ramén?

17:37.440 --> 17:38.726
It's just stupid.

17:39.440 --> 17:42.683
Okay, so Ramén feels the phone is stupid.

17:43.160 --> 17:44.571
Could you elaborate, Ramén?

17:44.840 --> 17:48.890
Stupid how?
Please be as specific as possible, Ramén.

17:49.400 --> 17:51.289
Well, it's slow.

17:52.120 --> 17:53.929
The apps keep quitting on me.

17:54.000 --> 17:56.810
I tried to watch a movie,
and it kept freezing up.

17:57.160 --> 17:59.811
And when I'm typing, like, there's a delay.

17:59.880 --> 18:01.769
Then all the letters pop up at once.

18:01.840 --> 18:04.605
You took a good phone
and you made it all, like, shitty.

18:04.680 --> 18:07.001
Keep in mind, I didn't design the phone.

18:07.080 --> 18:09.731
- It pissed me off.
- I appreciate your honesty, Ramén.

18:09.800 --> 18:11.404
That's just one guy's opinion.

18:11.480 --> 18:14.086
Who else feels this product is stupid?

18:15.320 --> 18:18.722
Allen, Lisa, Josh, Yana, Katie.

18:19.200 --> 18:21.885
And did it piss off anyone else?

18:23.760 --> 18:26.843
- Allen, Lisa, Josh, Yana, Katie.
- Okay.

18:26.920 --> 18:30.367
Christina, how bad is this? Be honest.

18:31.240 --> 18:33.368
Is this Windows Vista bad?

18:35.240 --> 18:37.846
It's not iPhone 4 bad, is it?

18:39.720 --> 18:42.610
Fuck. Don't tell me this is Zune bad.

18:44.040 --> 18:45.804
I'm sorry, Gavin.

18:45.880 --> 18:47.484
It's Apple Maps bad.

18:48.480 --> 18:51.324
And who else felt this
product is messed up?

18:52.280 --> 18:54.248
Allen, Lisa, Josh, Yana...

18:54.360 --> 18:56.044
GAVIN; Fuck!

18:56.960 --> 19:00.601
I'm sorry for the disturbance,
Allen, Lisa, Josh, Yana...

19:00.680 --> 19:03.001
So I can definitely get you
full res on the preview window.

19:03.120 --> 19:05.088
- Oh, sweet.
- Cool. I'll get right on that.

19:05.160 --> 19:07.891
You see how much smoother this all runs
without Erlich hanging around?

19:08.000 --> 19:09.570
Right, yeah.

19:09.640 --> 19:13.361
Hey, did you ever send me the mockup for
the logo placement of the player window?

19:13.440 --> 19:15.841
Seriously, you should think
about dropping that guy.

19:15.920 --> 19:18.321
But what do I know?
I just built a billion-dollar company.

19:18.400 --> 19:20.004
Yeah. Yeah, okay.

19:20.080 --> 19:22.367
But about the mockup
for the logo placement...

19:22.440 --> 19:24.488
Hey, I gotta go Skype
with my European distributor.

19:24.600 --> 19:26.125
Keep cranking it, okay?

19:26.200 --> 19:27.611
Sure, uh, will do.

19:34.440 --> 19:35.566
Excuse me.

19:36.640 --> 19:39.086
That's not the final graphic
for the live stream, is it?

19:39.160 --> 19:41.401
Yep. Double-A signed off on it.

19:41.480 --> 19:44.768
- Just that? There's nothing else?
- Nope.

19:46.400 --> 19:47.447
Hmm.

19:48.560 --> 19:52.360
Blaine doesn't die,
but he is horribly incapacitated.

19:52.440 --> 19:56.286
And then while he's in the hospital
he gets a flesh-eating virus,

19:56.360 --> 19:57.964
and then he dies.

19:59.280 --> 20:00.964
Well, obviously...

20:01.800 --> 20:04.087
His incessant suffering will be a strength.

20:04.160 --> 20:07.164
But our ability to enjoy
it is an opportunity.

20:07.240 --> 20:10.005
What if before he dies

20:10.080 --> 20:11.525
Gina catches the virus?

20:11.600 --> 20:15.241
And then she spreads it
from her vagina to your penis.

20:16.480 --> 20:18.482
Wait, so in this scenario,

20:18.560 --> 20:20.483
I get to have sex with Gina?

20:20.560 --> 20:21.641
That's an opportunity.

20:21.720 --> 20:24.246
- Okay, how about this?
- I'm listening.

20:24.920 --> 20:26.046
We let Blaine die,

20:26.160 --> 20:28.242
but then he's not around
to stop someone else

20:28.320 --> 20:30.766
from committing
some huge fucked-up act of evil?

20:30.840 --> 20:33.002
- The "Kill Hitler" scenario.
- Right.

20:34.680 --> 20:36.603
Hey, guys? You guys busy?

20:37.040 --> 20:38.041
Uh...

20:39.000 --> 20:41.048
Cool. Um...

20:41.920 --> 20:43.001
I got something I gotta say.

20:43.400 --> 20:47.803
Listen. I know that I was really rude
to both of you yesterday.

20:48.360 --> 20:49.850
It's just, um...

20:51.040 --> 20:53.930
When I got a stunt coming up,
I'm a bundle of nerves,

20:54.000 --> 20:57.049
and sometimes I can
take that out on other people.

20:57.840 --> 21:01.208
You know, even with all the support
that I get from Gina and our kids.

21:01.320 --> 21:02.685
- Kids.
- I don't know why.

21:03.600 --> 21:05.602
But... And then again,

21:05.680 --> 21:08.604
I'm a guy who needs to
risk his life jumping over stuff.

21:08.680 --> 21:10.523
So, what's that all about, right?

21:12.920 --> 21:15.844
You know, actually just an hour ago
I spotted an error in my math.

21:15.960 --> 21:18.611
Would have had me smeared
across the side of that building.

21:20.400 --> 21:22.801
Anyway, now I'm just totally rambling.

21:23.240 --> 21:25.049
Typical Blaine.

21:25.120 --> 21:28.886
What I wanted to say was that I'm sorry.

21:30.720 --> 21:32.370
Are we cool?

21:33.040 --> 21:35.805
Yeah, we're cool. Thanks for stopping by.

21:35.880 --> 21:39.362
Yeah, you should go quickly,
'cause we have work to do.

21:39.440 --> 21:40.441
Okay.

21:43.960 --> 21:45.246
What's this?

21:46.120 --> 21:47.804
What is that?

21:47.880 --> 21:49.405
"Let Blaine die"?

21:49.880 --> 21:50.927
Oh!

21:51.000 --> 21:53.606
Shit. We... We write in code.
We write in code.

21:53.680 --> 21:55.569
- This is compression...
- "Strengths.

21:55.640 --> 21:58.644
"Blaine's last moment
is realizing face is gone"?

21:59.080 --> 22:01.082
"Weaknesses. Blaine dies super fast."

22:01.160 --> 22:04.084
Yeah, you really shouldn't be looking
at that. That's all proprietary.

22:04.160 --> 22:06.401
"Opportunities, fuck Gina"?

22:07.840 --> 22:10.207
Would you believe
that was here when we came in?

22:10.280 --> 22:12.681
Double-A? Can I talk to you for a second?

22:12.760 --> 22:14.330
Yeah. Leave me alone for a sec.

22:14.400 --> 22:16.482
- What's up?
- Well, okay.

22:16.560 --> 22:18.642
I just saw a version of the player window

22:18.720 --> 22:22.611
that apparently you approved of
that says Powered by Homicide on it?

22:22.680 --> 22:24.682
Oh, yeah, it does.

22:25.640 --> 22:27.529
Right. Well, there's no Pied Piper logo.

22:27.600 --> 22:30.285
Like, anywhere. So what's up with that?

22:30.360 --> 22:31.805
Oh, well...

22:32.440 --> 22:33.885
Homicide is an energy drink,

22:33.960 --> 22:36.042
and "power" means energy.

22:36.120 --> 22:38.805
So that's kind of confusing
to the consumer,

22:39.440 --> 22:41.090
so I think we're gonna
keep it the way it is.

22:41.160 --> 22:44.004
Uh, the whole point of doing this

22:44.080 --> 22:46.811
was so that we could
get our name out there. Remember?

22:47.560 --> 22:49.403
I tell you what. Let's see
how it goes this time,

22:49.480 --> 22:50.891
the next time we'll work something out.

22:50.960 --> 22:54.726
No. No. We...
We can't see how it goes this time.

22:54.800 --> 22:56.211
There is no next time. Okay?

22:56.280 --> 22:58.726
We are racing to get
our platform ready for CES.

22:58.800 --> 23:02.885
And we took time away from doing that
to do this so we could get PR value.

23:02.960 --> 23:05.770
If no one sees the logo,
then there's no PR value at all.

23:05.840 --> 23:08.491
Oh, man. I'm sorry. But you get it.

23:08.880 --> 23:10.370
No, I don't get it.

23:10.440 --> 23:12.408
Okay, look, you have to put
our logo in the viewer.

23:12.480 --> 23:13.447
That's it, period.

23:13.520 --> 23:16.808
Mmm... Actually,
I don't have to do a damn thing.

23:16.880 --> 23:18.291
- Yeah, you do.
- No, I don't.

23:18.360 --> 23:19.725
Okay, then neither do I.

23:19.800 --> 23:23.088
Richard, don't be an asshole
like your buddy Kool-Aid. Okay?

23:23.160 --> 23:25.606
Just finish the build, okay?

23:27.280 --> 23:28.930
You know what, Double-A?

23:30.480 --> 23:32.369
Erlich was right.

23:32.440 --> 23:33.521
You are an asshole.

23:34.800 --> 23:36.928
In fact, you're a double-asshole!

23:42.320 --> 23:43.924
What did you call me?

23:44.560 --> 23:47.370
I... I called you a double-asshole.

23:47.720 --> 23:49.768
'Cause, you know, you're being an asshole.

23:50.360 --> 23:52.089
Double-A, Double-Asshole. You know?

23:52.200 --> 23:55.522
You're twice the asshole.
Twice-Hole. Double-Asshole.

23:57.960 --> 24:00.327
Oh. Ew. Is that a colostomy bag?

24:01.400 --> 24:04.324
Do you have any idea
what it's like to be 10 years old

24:04.400 --> 24:07.290
and carry your own shit around in a bag?

24:07.360 --> 24:10.091
To have two assholes?

24:10.160 --> 24:11.605
All right. I... I didn't know...

24:11.720 --> 24:13.802
- Hey, Richard?
- We should go.

24:13.880 --> 24:16.531
"Opportunities:
urinate on Blaine's grave"?

24:17.080 --> 24:20.084
"Grief threesome with Gina and Blaine's
hot mom, question mark"?

24:20.160 --> 24:21.650
- What the fuck?
- I didn't...

24:21.720 --> 24:25.008
- Richard, quickly!
- But, I mean, you were being an asshole.

24:25.560 --> 24:26.971
Okay, good luck.

24:29.040 --> 24:30.485
To his face?

24:30.560 --> 24:32.449
You called him that to his face?

24:32.520 --> 24:34.761
How could you not mention
the colostomy bag?

24:35.040 --> 24:38.487
Because it's a very private
and personal matter.

24:38.560 --> 24:41.882
- It's not a laughing matter!
- But you called him Double-Asshole first.

24:42.000 --> 24:44.685
- Remember? In college?
- Yeah, but not to his face.

24:44.760 --> 24:48.560
Never to his face!
Not even I'm that fucking cruel!

24:48.640 --> 24:50.165
But you are!

24:50.240 --> 24:51.526
I'm actually not.

24:51.600 --> 24:55.491
You tore Double-Asshole a third asshole!

24:58.080 --> 24:59.570
Triple-A!

25:01.320 --> 25:03.766
- Yeah, that was all my fault somehow?
- God!

25:07.440 --> 25:09.522
Yeah, that was a big wank.

25:11.760 --> 25:15.446
Since we're already set up for a live
stream, might I make a suggestion?

25:18.000 --> 25:19.001
Wow.

25:19.800 --> 25:21.802
It looks even better
than I thought it would.

25:24.160 --> 25:25.730
Is that a still image?

25:25.800 --> 25:27.040
It's not frozen, is it?

25:27.120 --> 25:29.487
No, it's live. It's just
not moving very much

25:29.560 --> 25:31.369
because it's a fucking egg.

25:31.800 --> 25:34.326
But think of the wonderful things
going on inside that egg.

25:34.400 --> 25:37.483
The resolution in your
imagination is infinite.

25:37.560 --> 25:39.847
Oh, hey, we're up to 17 views.

25:39.920 --> 25:43.811
Okay, well, this isn't the PR coup
that we'd envisioned,

25:43.880 --> 25:46.645
but Nucleus fucked up way worse.

25:47.320 --> 25:50.563
At least we can go back to work knowing
that we're the only middle-out compression

25:50.640 --> 25:51.846
that actually functions.

25:51.920 --> 25:53.888
New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc?

25:53.960 --> 25:56.531
Steel-aged, drinks great during the day.

25:56.600 --> 25:58.170
I can move, so you guys
can stand next to each other.

25:58.240 --> 25:59.366
- Jared, no.
- God, dude, no.

25:59.440 --> 26:01.204
Come on.

26:01.280 --> 26:03.408
- Russ, hey.
- Good job, my man!

26:03.480 --> 26:04.766
Fucking live stream looks amazing!

26:04.840 --> 26:07.650
- It does?
- Yeah, Homicide must be stoked!

26:07.720 --> 26:10.121
- Homicide? What?
- I love the new name. It's kick-ass.

26:10.200 --> 26:12.202
I always thought Pied Piper
was kind of a limp-dick name.

26:12.280 --> 26:13.361
EndFrame is way cooler.

26:13.440 --> 26:15.010
EndFrame? What?

26:17.080 --> 26:20.323
Three, two, one! Yeah!

26:21.680 --> 26:24.729
He made it. Farewell, sweet Gina.

26:25.240 --> 26:27.163
"Powered by EndFrame."

26:27.240 --> 26:29.083
Who the fuck is EndFrame?

26:29.160 --> 26:31.731
Why is their fucking logo
on this live stream?

26:31.800 --> 26:32.847
EndFrame isn't you guys?

26:32.920 --> 26:36.561
Oh, fuck! EndFrame is those guys
that brain-raped us at Branscomb Ventures.

26:36.680 --> 26:38.603
"EndFrame is a compression company

26:38.680 --> 26:41.684
"specializing in
middle-out compression technology."

26:42.240 --> 26:44.641
Those pricks! They stole my algorithm!

26:44.720 --> 26:47.451
I know guys at the FBI we could call.
Were you fucking hacked?

26:48.960 --> 26:49.961
Uh...

26:50.040 --> 26:51.451
Actually, no.

26:51.520 --> 26:52.726
Well, how did they get it then?

26:52.840 --> 26:55.286
- I'm sorry'?
- How did they get it then, Richard?

26:55.360 --> 26:56.441
How did they get it?

26:56.520 --> 26:59.922
Well, we... We kind of found ourselves
in their conference room,

27:00.000 --> 27:04.483
and accidentally sketched out
our key components

27:04.600 --> 27:07.285
to our algorithm's data model
on their Whiteboards.

27:08.920 --> 27:10.206
You fucking...

27:10.880 --> 27:12.120
Russ?

27:13.920 --> 27:15.410
He hung up.

27:15.880 --> 27:18.724
I'd file this one under "weakness," Jared.
