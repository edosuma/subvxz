01:16.250 --> 01:17.903
Yeah. He had some big meeting
he had to go to

01:17.947 --> 01:19.383

to project

01:19.427 --> 01:20.732

Come on, baby. [laughs]

Yeah, that old thing that you
forgot to take the tag off of.

01:30.786 --> 01:32.744
I didn't forget it.

So,

01:35.617 --> 01:37.749
how'd the big meeting go?

01:37.793 --> 01:39.795
Oh, amazing. They said it was

No, I'm trying to get out
of the cash-cleaning biz,

01:47.846 --> 01:49.152
and I'm gonna open up
my own laundromat.

01:49.196 --> 01:50.588
But the problem is
banks don't want

01:50.632 --> 01:53.243
to lend money to people
as good-looking as me.

01:53.287 --> 01:55.854

Higgins is gonna be very upset

when she finds out
that you borrowed her car.

Yeah, I'm sure Higgins'
mind is elsewhere

with the whole breakup.Um,

02:04.211 --> 02:06.865
excuse me, um,
Higgins is single?

What?SHAMMY:Nothing.

02:11.740 --> 02:13.655
You just, uh, don't strike me

02:13.698 --> 02:14.830
as Higgins' type.

02:14.873 --> 02:16.832
What? A big-time
entrepreneur

02:16.875 --> 02:18.529
with a Ferrari
isn't her type?

02:18.573 --> 02:20.140
Here's the thing, Jin.

02:20.183 --> 02:22.011
Not only do you
not own the Ferrari.

02:22.054 --> 02:23.578
It's actually
her Ferrari.

02:23.621 --> 02:25.101
That's why
we're perfect together.

02:25.145 --> 02:28.670
She likes to own Ferraris,
and I like to drive them.

out that Higgins

every bachelor on the island

02:41.683 --> 02:43.859

Now might be your chance, TM.

02:45.077 --> 02:47.950
That's something
my uncle would say.

02:47.993 --> 02:49.865
He would?Yeah, he thought
our friendship

02:49.908 --> 02:54.435
was the beginning
of something... more.

02:54.478 --> 02:55.740
Hmm.Hmm. Gotcha.

02:55.784 --> 02:57.351
You guys agree with him?

02:57.394 --> 03:01.181
Well, Bernardo is
a very intuitive guy.

03:01.224 --> 03:03.835
And you can't deny there's
a little something there.

03:03.879 --> 03:05.402
You know, I don't know

03:05.446 --> 03:07.274
if I'm more shocked by the fact
that Bernardo said that

03:07.317 --> 03:09.276
or the fact
that you guys agree with him.

03:09.319 --> 03:10.712
Oh, come on, real talk.

03:10.755 --> 03:12.322
You're telling us that you
never thought about it?

No! [laughs] Like, never.

03:16.021 --> 03:18.110
All right,
all right, well, look,

03:18.154 --> 03:20.243
when you work
that closely with somebody,

03:20.287 --> 03:23.986
sure, it crosses your mind.

03:24.029 --> 03:26.206
I don't know. I think it's fate.

03:26.249 --> 03:28.556
See, I think the universe

03:28.599 --> 03:31.515
brought you two together
as partners

03:31.559 --> 03:33.300
to lay a foundation.

03:33.343 --> 03:36.477
Fate? Foundation?
I mean, calm down.

03:36.520 --> 03:38.261
She just broke up
with the guy.

03:38.305 --> 03:40.263
Higgins and I
are business partners.

03:40.307 --> 03:43.092
Currently, we are nothing
more than friends, okay?

03:43.135 --> 03:45.007
"Currently."Hmm.

Okay, well,
we'll have

03:50.578 --> 03:52.623
to pick this up a little later.No, we will

03:52.667 --> 03:54.669
not have to pick it up, because
there's nothing to pick up.

03:54.712 --> 03:56.453
I'll see you guys.

how you doing?

04:03.547 --> 04:05.419
You know, other than dwelling

04:05.462 --> 04:07.203
on the ways I could've
handled things differently

04:07.247 --> 04:09.684
with Ethan,
you know, great.

04:09.727 --> 04:12.034
You know, if you want
to sit this one out,

04:12.077 --> 04:15.385
you know, decompress,
I can take care of the case.

04:15.429 --> 04:18.823
No, no, no. Working is a welcome
distraction, but thanks.

04:18.867 --> 04:20.695
Okay, so Kumu
referred this one?

04:20.738 --> 04:22.044

Oh, by the way,

04:27.049 --> 04:29.878
how did Jin like
hanging out in the Ferrari?

04:30.661 --> 04:32.272
You heard about that.

04:32.315 --> 04:35.318
You should know by now that I
know about most things, Magnum.

04:35.362 --> 04:36.537
How'd he slip up?

04:36.580 --> 04:37.886

04:40.497 --> 04:42.325
On the Ferrari?Mm-hmm.

04:42.369 --> 04:45.633
And these wonderful posts were
accompanied by elegant comments

04:45.676 --> 04:49.332
such as: "This ride
really slaps."

"Come on, I know you hunnies

Chloe's been, uh, pretty anxious
in general recently,

05:06.654 --> 05:10.353
so she called me after
what she found yesterday.

05:10.397 --> 05:11.746
What did you find?

05:11.789 --> 05:14.357
Um, well, I was...
I was driving on the Pali,

05:14.401 --> 05:16.185
and I blew a tire.

05:16.228 --> 05:17.795
While I was putting on
the spare,

05:17.839 --> 05:19.754
I saw something
in the wheel well.

05:21.495 --> 05:24.889
Some kind of tracker, right?

05:24.933 --> 05:27.152
Complete with location
proximity alerts.

05:27.196 --> 05:29.024
I've seen these before.
They're pretty expensive.

05:29.067 --> 05:30.895
Did you recently
purchase this car

05:30.939 --> 05:32.201
from a private seller?No.

05:32.244 --> 05:34.682
No, I'm the first
and only owner.

05:34.725 --> 05:36.379
Last few weeks,

05:36.423 --> 05:41.036
I felt like someone
was following me.

05:41.079 --> 05:43.168
I thought I was being paranoid,

05:43.212 --> 05:47.347
but now I'm worried
I have a stalker.

05:47.390 --> 05:48.652
What else has happened?

05:48.696 --> 05:50.872
I'm pretty sure
someone broke in here,

05:50.915 --> 05:52.395
but nothing was stolen.

05:52.439 --> 05:55.050
And have you contacted
the police?Yeah.

05:55.093 --> 05:56.660
Twice. They took statements.

05:56.704 --> 05:58.053
But, um...

05:58.096 --> 06:02.231
they thought my paranoia
has more to do with

06:02.274 --> 06:03.798
what I've been going through.

06:03.841 --> 06:07.236
Chloe's mother died last month.

06:07.279 --> 06:10.195
And, uh, it was
particularly hard

06:10.239 --> 06:12.720
because she was
her only family.

06:12.763 --> 06:15.853
Chloe has no siblings,
and her father died

06:15.897 --> 06:17.420

No.

they have.

10:32.980 --> 10:35.765
Remember when I said that, uh,

10:35.809 --> 10:38.202
I can't look at you the same?

10:39.160 --> 10:40.640
I was wrong.

10:41.902 --> 10:45.122
When I opened the door
just now,

10:45.166 --> 10:47.385
everything just came
flooding back.

10:47.429 --> 10:49.823
And I realized I...

10:52.260 --> 10:55.567
I ruined the best thing
that ever happened to me.

10:55.611 --> 10:57.265
I was stupid,

10:57.308 --> 11:00.224
I was impulsive,
I was wrong...
No.

11:00.268 --> 11:02.705
You didn't ruin anything.

11:02.749 --> 11:03.924
[stammers softly]

11:03.967 --> 11:05.665
Does that mean you'll
give me another...

11:15.152 --> 11:17.720
I take it that means yes.

11:17.764 --> 11:19.504
[laughs softly]
Yes.

11:24.858 --> 11:29.079
Guess we had our first
major bump in the road.

11:29.123 --> 11:30.733
It was bound to happen.

11:32.779 --> 11:34.955
And...

11:34.998 --> 11:38.393
now we just have to figure out
how to navigate

11:38.436 --> 11:41.265
a long-distance relationship.

11:42.223 --> 11:44.616
Okay. Um...

11:44.660 --> 11:47.141
This may sound insane, but...

11:48.882 --> 11:50.100
...you want to come with me?

11:50.144 --> 11:51.493
I only just
got you back,

11:51.536 --> 11:54.322
and I don't want
to be away from you. Uh...

11:54.365 --> 11:56.411
i-if I could stay,
I would, but...

11:56.454 --> 11:58.282
No, I-I could never
ask you to do that.

11:58.326 --> 12:00.458
Nor would I want you to.

12:00.502 --> 12:03.287
Look, I-I know it doesn't
sound glamorous,

12:03.331 --> 12:06.334
but... we'll be together.

12:06.377 --> 12:09.424
I-I know it's a big ask.

12:09.467 --> 12:12.862
And y-you don't have
to answer me now.

12:12.906 --> 12:14.908
Just...

12:14.951 --> 12:16.648
think about it.

12:16.692 --> 12:18.302
Okay?

12:39.846 --> 12:41.499
MAGNUM:
Okay, so maybe
Brayden lives here

12:41.543 --> 12:43.719
and uses the boat
as some kind of office.

12:46.069 --> 12:49.638
But if the car's still here,
where's Brayden?

13:09.397 --> 13:11.529
♪ I don't want to work

13:11.573 --> 13:13.836
♪ I want to bang
on the drum... ♪

13:13.880 --> 13:14.619
Magnum.

13:14.663 --> 13:16.056
Hey. I found Brayden.

13:16.099 --> 13:17.187
Did you question him?

13:17.231 --> 13:19.102
I can't. He's dead.

13:19.146 --> 13:21.365
What? How?

13:21.409 --> 13:23.324
I don't know.
There's no injuries on his body,

13:23.367 --> 13:24.847
but his smartwatch said
his heart stopped

13:24.891 --> 13:26.849
at 11:34 last night.

13:26.893 --> 13:32.159
Only thing on his cell phone
is just one picture.

13:32.202 --> 13:35.031
Of Chloe?No, some man. He's early 50s.

13:35.075 --> 13:37.817
It looks like
it was age-progressed.

13:37.860 --> 13:39.122
I'm sending it to you now.

13:39.166 --> 13:40.732
[computer chimes]

13:40.776 --> 13:43.126
Okay, got it.
I'm gonna run it now.

13:43.170 --> 13:44.301
Hey.

13:44.345 --> 13:45.912
How did it go with Ethan?

13:45.955 --> 13:49.698
It actually went quite well.
We are back together.

13:51.526 --> 13:53.484
Okay, that's good. Um...

13:53.528 --> 13:55.182
So he's not leaving?

13:55.225 --> 13:56.923
No, no, he-he's still leaving.

13:56.966 --> 13:58.925
We don't know
what's gonna happen next.

13:58.968 --> 14:01.971
We're just figuring it out.
Okay, I got a hit.

14:02.015 --> 14:04.582
The photo was pulled from
an FBI fugitive watch list.

14:04.626 --> 14:06.976
Subject is Henry Sellers.

14:07.020 --> 14:08.673
He's been on the run
for 22 years.

14:08.717 --> 14:10.066
Was wanted for murder.

14:10.110 --> 14:12.112
Okay, uh,
none of this makes sense.

14:12.155 --> 14:13.853
So Brayden was surveilling Chloe

14:13.896 --> 14:15.637
but also had an interest
in this Sellers guy.

14:15.680 --> 14:18.379
I-I don't see the connection.

14:18.727 --> 14:19.989
I forwarded the photo to Chloe.

14:20.033 --> 14:21.904
She doesn't recognize him.

14:21.948 --> 14:23.210
I got to run.

14:23.253 --> 14:24.472
Someone's here.

14:30.304 --> 14:31.696
[door closes]

14:33.960 --> 14:35.309
Hello, Henry.

14:36.397 --> 14:38.007
Potassium hydroxide.

14:38.051 --> 14:39.313
Is that for the guy
in the trunk?

14:39.356 --> 14:40.705
Who are you
and what do you want?

14:40.749 --> 14:43.186
Thomas Magnum. And for starters,
I'd like to know

14:43.230 --> 14:45.362
how you're connected
to Chloe Dawson.

14:47.799 --> 14:49.323
I'm her father.

14:49.366 --> 14:53.327
That's a nice try,
but her father's dead.

14:53.370 --> 14:55.416
That's what her mother told her
to keep her safe,

14:55.459 --> 14:57.853
but I assure you,
I am very much alive.

15:06.688 --> 15:08.298
How long have you been
working for my daughter?

15:08.342 --> 15:11.171
A couple hours.

15:11.214 --> 15:12.824
But let's talk about you.

15:13.695 --> 15:15.740
Start from
the beginning.

15:18.482 --> 15:22.356
In '96, the Russian SVR
embedded me in Hawaii.

15:23.226 --> 15:24.836
You were a spy?

15:25.707 --> 15:27.491
I was sent here to gather intel

15:27.535 --> 15:30.755
on the CIA's Pacific operations.

15:30.799 --> 15:33.889
Chloe's mother Lori worked
for a government contractor.

15:33.933 --> 15:39.155
I identified her as my way in,
but things got complicated.

15:39.199 --> 15:40.852
Meaning you got her pregnant.

15:40.896 --> 15:42.898
We fell in love.

15:44.682 --> 15:46.206
Which meant I had a choice.

15:46.249 --> 15:48.382
So...

15:49.209 --> 15:51.080
...I made plans to defect.

15:51.124 --> 15:52.777
But before I could
go through with it,

15:52.821 --> 15:54.214
my handler Nicholai found out.

15:54.257 --> 15:56.564
I'm guessing he's the man
you killed 22 years ago.

15:56.607 --> 16:00.350
I had no choice. I mean,
he tried to kill me first.

16:00.394 --> 16:02.309
[scoffs]

16:02.352 --> 16:05.790
Nicholai fought in Afghanistan.

16:05.834 --> 16:10.056
He came home to Ukraine,
and he survived Chernobyl,

16:10.099 --> 16:11.622
radiation sickness...

16:13.102 --> 16:18.716
...only to die in America
at the hand of a friend.

16:18.760 --> 16:21.328
So killing him
outed you as a spy

16:21.371 --> 16:23.025
and put you on the FBI's radar.

16:23.069 --> 16:25.114
Suddenly, you found yourself
being hunted by both them

16:25.158 --> 16:26.594
and the SVR.

16:27.899 --> 16:30.380
The only way to make sure
that Lori and Chloe were safe

16:30.424 --> 16:31.991
was to go into hiding.

16:32.034 --> 16:35.777
There wasn't a single day
that I didn't think about them.

16:38.301 --> 16:43.002
When I heard about Lori,
I came back to check on Chloe.

16:43.045 --> 16:45.961
She was all alone now,
and I just...

16:46.005 --> 16:48.920
just wanted to make sure
that she was okay.

16:48.964 --> 16:50.705
Which is why

16:50.748 --> 16:53.664
I was following her off and on
for a couple of weeks.

16:53.708 --> 16:55.579
In doing so,
I discovered that someone else

16:55.623 --> 16:57.016
was also following her.

16:58.321 --> 16:59.496
Brayden Marshall.

17:01.455 --> 17:02.499
Let me guess, he was SVR.

17:02.543 --> 17:03.631
Yeah. Seems that Moscow

17:03.674 --> 17:05.415
hasn't forgotten about me.

17:05.459 --> 17:08.244
So they were following Chloe
hoping it would lead to you.

17:08.288 --> 17:10.681
A pointless exercise because
she doesn't even know I exist.

17:10.725 --> 17:12.031
But Brayden
didn't know that.

17:12.074 --> 17:13.641
No.

17:13.684 --> 17:17.079
And I still have no idea how
SVR suddenly knows about her.

17:17.123 --> 17:19.647
You didn't think to ask him
before you killed him?

17:19.690 --> 17:21.518
I didn't kill him.

17:21.562 --> 17:24.260
I grabbed him, yes, I brought
him back for interrogation.

17:24.304 --> 17:26.871
But he took his own life
before I could get answers.

17:26.915 --> 17:29.135
How?
Some kind of poison.

17:29.178 --> 17:30.745
He-he probably had it
hidden in his clothes.

17:30.788 --> 17:33.095
I was gonna
deal with the body,

17:33.139 --> 17:35.054
and then try to determine if
he was working with anyone else

17:35.097 --> 17:37.926
and what, if anything,
he reported back to Moscow.

17:43.497 --> 17:45.934
You're trying to decide
if you should believe me.

17:47.066 --> 17:49.111
HIGGINS:
Sounds like a bit
of a tall tale.

17:49.155 --> 17:51.113
Thomas, this man
is an ex-Russian spy.

17:51.157 --> 17:52.897
Are you certain
that you can trust him?

17:52.941 --> 17:55.596
No, but my gut says
he's telling the truth.

17:55.639 --> 17:56.727
It's gonna be a lot

17:56.771 --> 17:58.077
for Chloe to process.

17:59.774 --> 18:01.428
Hang on.

18:02.777 --> 18:03.778
You expecting anyone?

18:03.821 --> 18:05.171
No.

18:08.174 --> 18:09.914
Got to be friends
of Brayden's.

18:09.958 --> 18:12.265
SVR? But how would
they know we're here?

18:13.179 --> 18:14.919
Uh, Brayden's phone.
When I turned it on,

18:14.963 --> 18:16.921
they probably
pinged it.

18:16.965 --> 18:17.922
Thomas, what's going on?

18:17.966 --> 18:19.141
Higgy, we got trouble.

18:19.185 --> 18:20.360
Call HPD.

Yeah.

19:52.756 --> 19:53.627
We're gonna need some help here.

19:54.932 --> 19:56.412
Help where? Where are you?

19:56.456 --> 19:57.761
I'm sending you a pin right now.

19:57.805 --> 19:59.285

but listen, the guys
who came for Henry,

they're still gonna
want him back.

And they may turn
to the only leverage they have.

21:39.341 --> 21:41.430
Chloe.MAGNUM: Yeah.

21:41.474 --> 21:43.214
They could have eyes
on her right now.

21:43.258 --> 21:44.564
Okay, I'm gonna call Katsumoto.

21:45.652 --> 21:46.740
Police are on
their way to Chloe.

Chloe, it's Juliet.

21:56.837 --> 21:58.447
Now, I need you
to listen to me very carefully.

21:58.491 --> 21:59.579
Is something wrong?

21:59.622 --> 22:00.928
You may be in danger.

22:00.971 --> 22:02.364
HPD are on their way,
but I need you to go over

22:02.408 --> 22:04.279
and lock all the doors
and check your windows, okay?

22:04.323 --> 22:06.586
Oh, my God.
I'm locking the front door.

22:06.629 --> 22:07.978
It's gonna be all right.
I just need you

22:08.022 --> 22:10.198
to go to the window
and tell me what you see.

22:14.158 --> 22:15.769
I don't see anyone.

22:35.136 --> 22:36.006
Chloe!

22:36.050 --> 22:38.357
Chloe! Chloe, are you there?!

22:49.498 --> 22:50.630
How's Henry?

22:50.673 --> 22:52.893
No idea. He's still in surgery.

22:52.936 --> 22:54.547
We're still processing,

22:54.590 --> 22:56.549
but so far, no leads
on Chloe's whereabouts.

22:56.592 --> 22:58.072
We have to assume they're
gonna want to make a trade.

22:58.115 --> 22:59.378
Henry for Chloe.

22:59.421 --> 23:00.553
RICK: Well, if they
want to make a swap,

23:00.596 --> 23:02.032
they're gonna need
to contact somebody.

23:02.076 --> 23:03.164
If they've been
watching Chloe,

23:03.207 --> 23:04.426
odds are they know
you two are involved,

23:04.470 --> 23:05.993
which means they'll probably
reach out to you.

23:06.036 --> 23:07.647
Yeah, but you can't just wait
for that call to come in.

23:07.690 --> 23:09.039
No, we can't wait.
If we're gonna find Chloe,

23:09.083 --> 23:11.564
we have to identify
Brayden's associates.

23:11.607 --> 23:13.130
No, the Russian government
won't be any help.

23:13.174 --> 23:15.176
They're denying everything.No surprise there.

23:15.219 --> 23:17.613
Wait, what about
the harbor?

If Brayden met his
associates at the Ala Wai,

23:20.355 --> 23:21.791
it's gonna be
on security camera.

23:21.835 --> 23:23.706

23:23.750 --> 23:25.360

than just follow Chloe.

I may have spoken too soon.

23:34.978 --> 23:37.285
If there is spyware on here,
it's likely an APT

and encryption.

23:39.505 --> 23:41.463

the wrong e-mail or something.

send your DNA and they--

turns out we all are. So what?

23:55.782 --> 23:58.567
Sellers said he didn't know how
the Russians got onto Chloe.

23:58.611 --> 24:00.613
I'm guessing this
is how they did it.

24:00.656 --> 24:02.963
I mean, they had to have had
his DNA from back in the day.

24:03.006 --> 24:04.834
Right? Then they
hack into databases

find a familial match.
