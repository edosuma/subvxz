00:06.083 --> 00:08.750
A NETFLIX SERIES

00:11.416 --> 00:12.791
<i>This home is truly special.</i>

00:13.625 --> 00:17.541
<i>I know. There's no elevator,</i>
<i>and there are 99 steps to get there.</i>

00:17.625 --> 00:20.833
<i>but it's worth climbing them all</i>
<i>because you will love it.</i>

00:23.583 --> 00:25.208
We will now leave the sleeping area

00:25.291 --> 00:27.833
and come back down to the hall,
which you already know.

00:27.916 --> 00:33.083
Even here,<i> </i>we have beautiful
late-1800s graniglia flooring.

00:33.166 --> 00:34.250
And… After you.

00:35.041 --> 00:36.166
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

00:36.666 --> 00:38.250
This will leave you breathless.

00:40.041 --> 00:41.750
The strong point of the home,

00:42.375 --> 00:44.916
the bright and airy
60 square meter living room.

00:45.000 --> 00:46.041
Isn't it wonderful?

00:46.125 --> 00:47.666
-It's nice.
-Yes, but here…

00:47.750 --> 00:50.041
We'd always have to keep
the curtains closed.

00:50.125 --> 00:54.208
Otherwise, it would be like
living with the lady across from us.

00:56.000 --> 00:56.833
Hello.

00:56.916 --> 00:58.000
-May I?
-Hello.

00:58.083 --> 00:59.333
-Hello.
-Hello.

00:59.416 --> 01:00.416
Ms. Verna?

01:00.500 --> 01:01.500
Carlo Pentecoste.

01:01.583 --> 01:04.000
We spoke this morning
about the appointment.

01:05.083 --> 01:06.625
Of course. I'm sorry.

01:07.750 --> 01:11.041
I got confused
and must have double-booked appointments.

01:11.541 --> 01:14.041
I don't know.
Could you wait a few minutes?

01:14.125 --> 01:15.125
Not really.

01:15.208 --> 01:18.208
I have a very important
work commitment later. I'm sorry.

01:18.291 --> 01:20.750
Well, if you have a work commitment…

01:21.500 --> 01:23.541
perhaps we can
finish the viewing together?

01:23.625 --> 01:24.750
If we have to.

01:24.833 --> 01:26.041
-Thank you.
-Thanks.

01:27.666 --> 01:29.416
But so much natural light!

01:30.416 --> 01:31.250
Yes…

01:31.333 --> 01:33.083
This is one of the rare cases in Milan

01:33.166 --> 01:36.250
where there are no other buildings
blocking the sunlight.

01:38.250 --> 01:40.625
You should see the color of the sunset.

01:40.708 --> 01:42.916
-It must be so hot in summer.
-Yes, indeed.

01:43.000 --> 01:45.333
Well, it's still a very bright room.

01:47.083 --> 01:49.041
The sleeping area has air conditioning.

01:49.125 --> 01:52.208
-Yes. I'd like to see that again.
-Yes, if possible--

01:52.291 --> 01:53.458
-Sure.
-Thank you.

02:00.125 --> 02:01.291
It's lovely.

02:02.541 --> 02:04.750
The apartment. So many details.

02:06.333 --> 02:08.458
-I'm glad you like it.
-Very much so.

02:09.583 --> 02:11.541
At least from what I've been able to see.

02:11.625 --> 02:15.000
It's a very big apartment.
There are different areas to discover.

02:15.083 --> 02:17.458
I'm looking forward
to discovering these areas.

02:18.125 --> 02:20.416
-Would the apartment be just for you?
-Yes.

02:22.416 --> 02:25.000
It's a very big home for just one person.

02:27.041 --> 02:28.291
We should go. Thanks.

02:28.375 --> 02:30.958
-Yes. I have a meeting. So thank you.
-Excuse me.

02:31.041 --> 02:31.958
Of course.

02:32.791 --> 02:33.666
Perfect.

02:33.750 --> 02:36.625
I hope the viewing lived up
to your expectations.

02:36.708 --> 02:40.208
-Sure.
-Nothing like the listing, as usual.

02:40.291 --> 02:41.708
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

03:20.791 --> 03:21.708
Nothing to say?

04:10.250 --> 04:11.083
And you?

04:11.583 --> 04:12.791
What do you feel?

04:13.833 --> 04:15.375
I don't feel safe.

04:15.458 --> 04:17.625
She doesn't feel safe.

04:17.708 --> 04:20.291
Lara says she does not feel safe.

04:20.375 --> 04:21.208
Why?

04:21.791 --> 04:23.208
-No, shut your eyes!
-Sorry.

04:24.791 --> 04:26.791
Maybe she's afraid of being discovered.

04:27.625 --> 04:31.500
Maybe the man and woman are arguing
about something very private.

04:31.583 --> 04:32.625
Possibly.

04:32.708 --> 04:36.208
But let's try
and pay more attention to the words,

04:36.291 --> 04:37.416
to the details.

04:37.500 --> 04:41.041
Lara was specific.
She said that she doesn't feel safe.

04:41.125 --> 04:42.750
But why?

04:42.833 --> 04:43.791
Sofia, why?

04:44.333 --> 04:47.708
Not feeling safe is a feeling
that's linked to childhood,

04:47.791 --> 04:50.208
when adults were there to protect us.

04:51.791 --> 04:52.708
So,

04:53.625 --> 04:55.083
she's a child now.

04:57.125 --> 05:00.041
And the two people fighting
are her parents.

05:02.125 --> 05:03.500
And she's upset.

05:05.166 --> 05:06.500
She's upset because…

05:07.541 --> 05:09.666
they are a symbol of safety.

05:14.416 --> 05:15.250
Okay.

05:17.125 --> 05:18.208
Open your eyes.

05:18.791 --> 05:20.041
How did you feel?

05:20.125 --> 05:22.958
The darkness we had to fill
gave me a sense of freedom.

05:23.500 --> 05:25.375
Go sit down. Yes, but go on.

05:25.458 --> 05:26.625
Something more.

05:26.708 --> 05:29.041
-No fear of judgment.
-Bingo!

05:29.125 --> 05:30.833
The fear of being judged.

05:30.916 --> 05:34.166
That is the fear that prevents us
from living intensely,

05:34.250 --> 05:36.625
and therefore from writing freely.

05:36.708 --> 05:39.375
This is the question
we have to ask ourselves.

05:39.458 --> 05:42.333
To whom do we owe our fidelity?

05:42.916 --> 05:44.000
To others?

05:44.750 --> 05:45.833
Or to ourselves?

05:53.666 --> 05:54.500
Hello.

05:54.583 --> 05:55.416
Hello.

05:56.958 --> 05:58.958
I'm waiting for Daniele.

05:59.500 --> 06:00.791
Daniele isn't here.

06:02.500 --> 06:03.583
How come?

06:04.166 --> 06:06.125
Tendinitis. I'm covering him. Andrea.

06:07.833 --> 06:08.833
Margherita.

06:09.458 --> 06:10.333
Lie down.

06:13.583 --> 06:15.666
When did this osteitis pubis start?

06:17.833 --> 06:20.708
Five years ago, after a bad fall. Then…

06:22.083 --> 06:25.583
Let's say the pain had disappeared.
I started running again.

06:26.333 --> 06:29.166
The pain came back
and doesn't stop bothering me.

06:29.250 --> 06:30.958
Two sessions a week from now on.

06:31.916 --> 06:34.166
It's a bit tough for me to find the time--

06:34.250 --> 06:35.625
You mustn't neglect yourself.

06:39.458 --> 06:40.583
Okay.

07:00.250 --> 07:02.666
I don't get it. Good sign or bad sign?

07:03.250 --> 07:04.083
Neither.

07:05.291 --> 07:06.166
So?

07:07.375 --> 07:10.666
You feel pain somewhere,
but the cause could be elsewhere.

07:16.708 --> 07:20.916
In the next exercise,
you will tell an autobiographical story.

07:21.000 --> 07:24.625
You'll have to get in touch
with your inner self

07:24.708 --> 07:28.250
and tell me about a day
that was particularly important,

07:28.333 --> 07:32.333
one of those days
that made a mark on you, that scarred you.

07:32.416 --> 07:36.541
Usually, those are the days
that make us understand who we really are

07:36.625 --> 07:39.833
and what the sound of our true voice is.

07:45.250 --> 07:46.625
Did you read my story?

07:48.375 --> 07:50.541
Yes, all in one go.

07:51.541 --> 07:52.541
And?

07:53.041 --> 07:53.916
And nothing.

07:54.625 --> 07:56.458
You're talented. Very talented.

07:56.541 --> 08:00.791
But you've hidden your talent
in an imaginary world too far from you.

08:00.875 --> 08:03.166
Why not write something more simple,

08:03.250 --> 08:04.791
something more honest?

08:04.875 --> 08:08.916
You have a beautiful voice.
You just have to learn how to use it.

08:09.000 --> 08:09.833
That's all.

08:09.916 --> 08:12.458
Focus on the autobiographical story now.

08:14.041 --> 08:17.083
It will help you figure out
what you're really trying to say.

08:22.166 --> 08:23.166
Sorry.

08:23.250 --> 08:24.250
For what?

08:24.333 --> 08:26.166
Have you already read this one?

08:26.250 --> 08:27.083
No.

08:28.125 --> 08:29.250
Take it.

08:29.333 --> 08:31.708
A fair bit of real life in this.

08:31.791 --> 08:32.750
It will help you.

08:33.416 --> 08:35.208
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

08:36.333 --> 08:38.458
-Bye.
-Bye.

09:14.375 --> 09:15.250
Hey!

09:16.125 --> 09:17.250
Is that you, honey?

09:17.333 --> 09:19.750
Depends on who you're expecting me to be.

09:20.375 --> 09:21.958
I didn't hear you come in.

09:23.083 --> 09:24.583
Can you hand me a towel?

09:32.500 --> 09:33.750
Fuck!

09:35.125 --> 09:37.083
-Carlo!
-Yes, I know.

09:37.166 --> 09:39.375
-It's broken.
-It's a small house. Things break.

09:39.458 --> 09:44.458
But if you were a bit more careful,
you'd see that the door opens,

09:44.541 --> 09:45.833
and you can get out.

09:45.916 --> 09:48.000
-You have magic hands.
-Yes, I do.

09:48.875 --> 09:51.791
Does the physiotherapist? Did he fix you?

09:53.208 --> 09:54.791
There was a new guy today.

09:55.291 --> 09:57.416
Daniele has tendinitis. Ironic, huh?

09:59.291 --> 10:01.000
And how is the new one?

10:02.416 --> 10:03.250
Hot!

10:03.833 --> 10:04.958
Oh, he's hot?

10:06.416 --> 10:08.458
Hotter than your client this morning?

10:12.791 --> 10:16.500
Actually, I need a few more details
before making my offer, you know?

10:16.583 --> 10:17.750
Oh, really?

10:17.833 --> 10:19.916
So you want another appointment?

10:20.000 --> 10:21.125
I'd love that!

10:23.000 --> 10:25.541
Who knows how much
a place like that costs!

10:25.625 --> 10:26.541
A lot.

10:27.041 --> 10:28.083
How much?

10:29.000 --> 10:30.083
Too much for us.

10:30.750 --> 10:31.791
Really?

10:32.375 --> 10:33.291
Yes.

10:33.875 --> 10:35.500
But do you really love it?

10:36.083 --> 10:39.958
Darling, I see ten of them a day,
and that one is special.

10:40.041 --> 10:41.125
It has a soul.

10:43.250 --> 10:44.375
What did you do today?

10:45.083 --> 10:46.958
Graded a lot of tests.

10:47.041 --> 10:48.416
-Get any writing done?
-No.

10:49.166 --> 10:52.708
I'm waiting for your second novel.
I can't wait to read it!

10:53.291 --> 10:55.625
-Did you order pizza?
-Yes. It'll be here soon.

10:55.708 --> 10:56.958
-Take a shower.
-Okay.

11:40.250 --> 11:42.416
ONE MAN, ONE WOMAN
BY CARLO PENTECOSTE

11:48.208 --> 11:51.875
IN THAT MOMENT, HE REALIZED THAT…

12:12.000 --> 12:13.250
-Who is it?
-Me.

12:13.333 --> 12:14.916
-<i>"Me," who?</i>
<i>-</i>Your daughter.

12:24.958 --> 12:26.125
Hey!

12:27.625 --> 12:29.291
-Are you here?
-I'm here.

12:30.000 --> 12:31.875
-How's it going?
-Fine. You?

12:32.458 --> 12:33.708
I dreamed about Pannella.

12:34.750 --> 12:35.791
And?

12:35.875 --> 12:38.625
And? Every time I do,
something bad happens.

12:38.708 --> 12:42.000
-All okay with you and Carlo?
-Yes. Someone else must be in trouble.

12:42.083 --> 12:43.750
Must be. Better that way.

12:43.833 --> 12:46.250
So, tell me. This one or this one?

12:46.333 --> 12:48.000
Mom, please. We're late.

12:48.083 --> 12:50.416
You know how Carlo gets
when visiting his parents.

12:50.500 --> 12:53.875
-Come on! This one or this one?
-Gray. It's more elegant.

12:54.541 --> 12:56.791
Gray, more elegant? No!

12:57.833 --> 12:59.625
Come on! Let's go.

13:00.625 --> 13:02.791
-The gift!
-The gift.

13:03.791 --> 13:04.916
The gift.

13:17.750 --> 13:19.208
-Hi, Mom.
-Hi.

13:19.708 --> 13:20.625
Happy birthday!

13:21.291 --> 13:22.125
Thank you.

13:23.291 --> 13:25.500
Happy birthday, Loretta. You look great.

13:25.583 --> 13:28.458
Thanks, honey.
You're as beautiful as ever.

13:28.541 --> 13:29.958
-Happy birthday.
-Anna.

13:30.041 --> 13:31.125
Thank you.

13:31.208 --> 13:33.333
-This is for you.
-Thank you.

13:38.708 --> 13:40.958
-Is it a scarf?
-Yes. Do you like it?

13:42.041 --> 13:43.833
Yes, it's very interesting.

13:43.916 --> 13:47.333
-Did you make it?
-Yes. Maybe it's a bit eccentric for you.

13:47.416 --> 13:51.250
But, come on, it's fun
to be a bit crazy, isn't it? At 60!

13:51.333 --> 13:52.375
Indeed.

13:52.458 --> 13:54.166
Okay, let's go in. Come on.

13:54.250 --> 13:56.375
Your father is already seated and waiting.

14:04.458 --> 14:06.875
So, Margherita, how's the therapy going?

14:06.958 --> 14:08.625
Not helping, unfortunately.

14:09.125 --> 14:13.000
In fall, when the humidity returns,
so does the pain.

14:13.500 --> 14:15.250
It was Carlo's fault, right?

14:15.333 --> 14:18.125
My fault? What, the arrival of fall?

14:19.916 --> 14:23.166
Actually, I got hurt
when chasing him a few years ago.

14:23.666 --> 14:27.083
But what's a little pain
in exchange for a happy life?

14:27.166 --> 14:29.333
And you still decided to marry him.

14:29.416 --> 14:31.583
Even though artists
are a risky investment.

14:38.083 --> 14:39.166
SOFIA
TOMORROW?

14:39.250 --> 14:40.208
Who is it?

14:40.291 --> 14:41.583
Nobody. Work.

14:41.666 --> 14:42.833
CARLO
SURE

14:42.916 --> 14:44.625
Your writing course?

14:44.708 --> 14:45.541
Yeah.

14:45.625 --> 14:46.750
SOFIA
USUAL PLACE?

14:46.833 --> 14:49.083
And how are your sales going?

14:49.166 --> 14:50.250
CARLO
ALL RIGHT

14:50.333 --> 14:52.875
Well, the market is in crisis,
but we're holding on.

14:53.416 --> 14:57.000
-I took on a beautiful place recently.
-Really? Where?

14:57.083 --> 15:00.083
In Concordia.
Given its value, the price is low.

15:00.166 --> 15:02.125
This could be a chance for you.

15:02.208 --> 15:05.750
Not so low to be within our reach.

15:05.833 --> 15:07.000
We could help you

15:07.083 --> 15:09.000
like we helped his sister.

15:09.083 --> 15:10.458
It's time to grow up.

15:10.958 --> 15:13.375
You can't live in a studio forever.

15:13.458 --> 15:15.625
As long as they're happy, right?

15:16.750 --> 15:18.333
Margherita, are you happy there?

15:20.208 --> 15:22.125
It's not the right time to move.

15:22.208 --> 15:26.000
-Carlo is working on a new novel.
-It's been four years since the last.

15:26.083 --> 15:28.000
Why not discuss something more important?

15:28.083 --> 15:30.791
Like, I don't know,
how many lives did you save this week?

15:36.333 --> 15:38.500
Anyway, I've read
what he's written so far,

15:38.583 --> 15:40.166
and it's incredible.

15:41.125 --> 15:43.416
It's the best thing Carlo's ever written.

15:49.250 --> 15:52.125
Fancy ordering something
and watching a film?

15:52.208 --> 15:53.583
No. I'll cook.

15:57.166 --> 15:58.791
-Thanks.
-For what?

16:00.583 --> 16:02.500
For lying about my novel.

16:04.041 --> 16:06.875
I know you'll never let me read it
before it's finished,

16:06.958 --> 16:08.625
but I know it's going well.

16:09.291 --> 16:11.666
You just need to find
the right push to finish it.

16:14.416 --> 16:17.041
Listen, do you have classes tomorrow?

16:17.541 --> 16:19.333
I have a gap between two viewings--

16:19.416 --> 16:20.833
Listen, those two

16:22.333 --> 16:23.791
from the Concordia home.

16:23.875 --> 16:25.750
-Have they made an offer?
-No.

16:25.833 --> 16:27.083
Do you think they will?

16:28.208 --> 16:31.041
I don't know. You saw how they were. All…

16:35.250 --> 16:36.583
What if we do?

16:37.541 --> 16:40.708
No, I don't want you to say yes
to your father to make me happy.

16:40.791 --> 16:44.291
-We've always managed.
-Who said I want to ask my dad for money?

16:45.208 --> 16:46.291
So how, then?

16:46.875 --> 16:48.000
With my novel.

16:48.583 --> 16:50.416
You have to finish writing it first.

16:50.500 --> 16:51.458
It's like you said.

16:52.333 --> 16:55.833
I just need a push,
and maybe that place is the right push.

16:57.375 --> 16:59.208
Yes, I know. It's a bet.

16:59.291 --> 17:01.666
And probably reckless, but…

17:02.500 --> 17:06.291
Can you imagine it as our home,
so big you can decorate it as you want?

17:06.875 --> 17:08.375
No more broken showers.

17:10.041 --> 17:13.041
Even if those two don't make an offer,
there will be others.

17:13.125 --> 17:15.250
A studio! A studio all of my own!

17:15.333 --> 17:17.625
A room for our kids to grow up in

17:18.958 --> 17:20.833
when we decide to have them.

17:43.875 --> 17:46.416
You have to find out
what's blocking you, Sofia.

17:47.916 --> 17:50.750
Maybe these sheets
don't contain the right story.

17:52.416 --> 17:56.291
Maybe you still haven't understood
which day was your life's turning point.

17:58.833 --> 17:59.958
What was yours?

18:03.541 --> 18:06.250
One day in late September five years ago.

18:07.833 --> 18:08.875
I was on my bike.

18:10.250 --> 18:12.250
I still didn't have a steady job.

18:13.000 --> 18:15.750
I hadn't finished writing my first novel.

18:18.333 --> 18:21.333
And I had just met the woman
who would become

18:21.916 --> 18:23.125
my future wife.

18:24.083 --> 18:25.875
But I wasn't married yet.

18:28.875 --> 18:30.541
Everything was still possible.

18:33.458 --> 18:34.875
That's a nice memory.

18:35.541 --> 18:36.541
Is yours?

18:40.000 --> 18:42.333
If talking about it
makes you so uncomfortable,

18:42.416 --> 18:44.250
I can assign you a different task.

18:46.041 --> 18:49.583
But you don't want that.
You know what story you want to tell.

18:50.416 --> 18:53.166
You just want to find
the courage to do it, right?

18:54.666 --> 18:56.083
Okay. I'll try.

18:56.166 --> 18:57.500
Great!

18:57.583 --> 18:59.083
But on one condition.

18:59.833 --> 19:01.666
If you read mine, I read yours.

19:01.750 --> 19:03.250
No.

19:03.333 --> 19:05.125
I never let anyone read my work.

19:05.208 --> 19:06.791
Make an exception.

19:08.583 --> 19:11.000
I have to write
about something very private.

19:13.291 --> 19:15.250
I want to know if I can trust you.

19:17.916 --> 19:18.750
Okay.

19:19.333 --> 19:20.458
I'll think about it.

19:21.791 --> 19:22.958
You start though.

19:32.041 --> 19:33.583
I've changed my mind.

19:33.666 --> 19:36.375
I'll go home and check it over again.

19:37.541 --> 19:38.708
We're done anyway, right?

19:39.666 --> 19:41.250
We're done. You can go.

19:42.333 --> 19:43.291
Bye.

19:43.375 --> 19:44.208
Bye.

19:47.125 --> 19:48.583
Where do you live?

19:50.041 --> 19:51.041
Need a ride?

19:53.166 --> 19:54.000
Yes.

19:55.208 --> 19:56.083
Thanks.

19:58.833 --> 19:59.708
That way.

20:02.333 --> 20:05.208
Yeah, it's a bit crazy,
but we want to try.

20:05.875 --> 20:09.250
This place is special, Mom.
You have to see it to understand.

20:11.041 --> 20:12.291
Okay.

20:13.041 --> 20:15.375
I'm going. I just got here. Bye.

20:16.791 --> 20:18.375
-Hi, Eva!
-Hey, Marghe.

20:19.083 --> 20:22.500
Listen, how did Friday's viewing
at the Concordia place go?

20:22.583 --> 20:25.958
There was another buyer, right?
A certain Carlo something?

20:26.041 --> 20:28.625
Carlo Pentecoste, I think.

20:29.375 --> 20:31.291
Thanks for giving him the address.

20:31.375 --> 20:33.916
He really liked the apartment, by the way.

20:36.166 --> 20:37.458
-Good morning.
-Morning!

20:37.541 --> 20:38.541
Hello.

20:41.250 --> 20:43.333
-Please, take a seat.
-Thank you.

20:44.916 --> 20:48.625
So, I assume you want
to consider other options?

20:48.708 --> 20:51.541
I don't think you were
persuaded by the apartment.

20:51.625 --> 20:53.750
Quite the opposite. We want it.

20:55.375 --> 20:56.208
Oh, good.

20:56.291 --> 21:01.125
We're already thinking about renovations.
We want to knock some walls down.

21:01.208 --> 21:03.041
The floor plan allows that, right?

21:04.166 --> 21:05.416
I'm sorry, but why?

21:05.500 --> 21:07.208
To have a bigger living room.

21:07.291 --> 21:10.583
Sure, but the living room
is already 60 square meters.

21:11.333 --> 21:13.791
And these things
require special permissions.

21:13.875 --> 21:16.916
Yes. My cousin is a surveyor.
We'll get permission.

21:17.000 --> 21:18.833
Can we please close the deal?

21:18.916 --> 21:20.375
-Of course.
-Thank you.

21:20.875 --> 21:24.458
Okay, we're offering 20% less
than the asking price.

21:24.541 --> 21:26.500
That seems a bit low to me.

21:27.000 --> 21:28.166
Between you and I,

21:29.875 --> 21:33.583
we're going to buy the home
whether the owner budges or not.

21:33.666 --> 21:35.666
Luckily, we aren't strapped for cash.

21:37.125 --> 21:38.125
Fine.

21:42.958 --> 21:44.125
Thanks for the ride.

21:45.083 --> 21:46.083
Don't mention it.

21:49.208 --> 21:50.083
I'm off.

21:50.750 --> 21:52.625
Yes. See you in class.

22:02.166 --> 22:03.625
Talking to you helped.

22:05.125 --> 22:05.958
Thank you.

22:07.625 --> 22:08.458
-Bye.
-Bye.

22:53.916 --> 22:56.791
Well, they're my latest purchase.
I like them!

22:56.875 --> 22:58.333
-They're nice!
-They're nice!

22:58.833 --> 22:59.708
Well,

23:00.208 --> 23:01.333
sisters…

23:01.416 --> 23:02.500
There he is!

23:04.583 --> 23:06.125
-Hey, mate.
-Hey! Hello.

23:07.375 --> 23:08.666
Sorry for being late.

23:08.750 --> 23:10.208
-You're right.
-Honey.

23:11.458 --> 23:13.875
-I was just texting you. What happened?
-Nothing.

23:13.958 --> 23:17.208
I had a private lesson
that took longer than expected.

23:17.833 --> 23:18.666
I'm exhausted.

23:18.750 --> 23:20.708
-You don't seem it.
-You and your lessons.

23:20.791 --> 23:24.000
Instead of making others write,
write yourself!

23:24.083 --> 23:26.750
Who had the bright idea
of inviting my editor?

23:26.833 --> 23:28.166
-You.
-Me?

23:28.250 --> 23:31.458
-Shall we order, guys?
-Shall we get the usual menu?

23:32.416 --> 23:34.791
Well, Margherita,
when you say it like that…

23:34.875 --> 23:37.250
But I said it because I like it so much!

23:37.333 --> 23:38.250
I know!

23:38.333 --> 23:39.458
The wine's good!

23:40.416 --> 23:42.666
I've been dreaming about it for years.

23:42.750 --> 23:45.083
I even put the postcard in the kitchen.

23:45.166 --> 23:46.000
Good, huh?

23:46.083 --> 23:49.458
Malé Atoll, and now, we might get there.

23:49.541 --> 23:50.416
-We hope.
-We hope.

23:50.500 --> 23:52.125
Lovely! When are you going?

23:52.208 --> 23:54.458
In two weeks, if he can pry himself away.

23:54.541 --> 23:55.791
-The Maldives?
-Yeah.

23:56.666 --> 23:58.708
Sharks, storms, awful experience.

23:58.791 --> 24:00.541
-No! Why?
-How do you know?

24:00.625 --> 24:03.666
When did you go to the Maldives?
Which lover did you go with?

24:03.750 --> 24:06.291
Companions, not lovers.
Don't belittle them.

24:06.916 --> 24:08.541
You know, I can't remember.

24:08.625 --> 24:11.250
-When did I go?
-Sorry, why are you looking at her?

24:11.333 --> 24:13.583
-Exactly!
-I thought I saw you.

24:13.666 --> 24:17.041
No! I've never been
to the Maldives with you.

24:18.125 --> 24:19.625
We're moving.

24:19.708 --> 24:21.750
Have you already found a place?

24:22.250 --> 24:24.083
-Well…
-Well…

24:24.166 --> 24:25.375
It depends.

24:25.458 --> 24:27.625
It depends on the deal
I close with my editor!

24:27.708 --> 24:29.458
So there's finally a book?

24:29.541 --> 24:31.000
Start writing the check!

24:31.083 --> 24:33.291
Can I hope to read something soon?

24:33.375 --> 24:35.708
You'll need to get in line. I'm sorry.

24:35.791 --> 24:39.458
With the first book, he was stuck halfway.
We met, he finished it in two weeks.

24:39.541 --> 24:43.250
So I've really earned
the role of first reader!

24:43.333 --> 24:44.541
-Right?
-<i>Ubi maior.</i>

24:45.708 --> 24:47.791
But I will put pressure on you.

24:47.875 --> 24:49.708
I have no doubt you will.

24:49.791 --> 24:51.041
For sure!

24:51.125 --> 24:53.125
-Let's make a toast.
-Okay.

24:53.208 --> 24:55.750
To new beaches, new homes,

24:55.833 --> 24:57.500
new books. Yes? Yes.

24:57.583 --> 24:59.041
-Yes.
-Yes.

24:59.125 --> 25:00.291
To how beautiful we are.

25:00.875 --> 25:01.791
Cheers, guys.

25:01.875 --> 25:03.000
-Cheers.
-Cheers!

25:07.708 --> 25:09.875
Listen, Concordia…

25:10.750 --> 25:12.541
-I think we're gonna lose it.
-Why?

25:13.125 --> 25:15.875
Those two came to the agency today.
They want to make an offer.

25:15.958 --> 25:18.166
No! What rotten luck!

25:19.333 --> 25:20.166
I know.

25:21.750 --> 25:23.291
You know what this means?

25:23.833 --> 25:26.000
We'll stick with renting for life.

25:26.083 --> 25:26.958
Forever.

25:30.916 --> 25:32.541
I'm kidding!

25:32.625 --> 25:33.625
I'm joking!

25:34.166 --> 25:35.083
Come on!

25:36.000 --> 25:37.458
We'll find another place.

25:37.541 --> 25:39.291
It won't take long with your job.

25:40.583 --> 25:41.583
So that's it?

25:43.125 --> 25:44.458
What do you mean?

25:45.000 --> 25:45.875
I don't know.

25:46.791 --> 25:48.083
It's like you don't care.

25:48.666 --> 25:50.416
No! Why, sorry?

25:51.125 --> 25:54.333
I'm really sorry.
But if they've already made an offer,

25:54.416 --> 25:56.125
what can we do?

25:56.208 --> 25:57.958
Yes, I know. It's just that...

25:58.041 --> 26:00.250
I wanted it to be our forever home.

26:00.333 --> 26:01.708
The one we'd remain in.

26:01.791 --> 26:02.791
Darling,

26:02.875 --> 26:04.500
we just have to wait a bit.

26:04.583 --> 26:05.458
Okay?

26:28.041 --> 26:31.083
PRINT

26:53.083 --> 26:57.125
A LOVE STORY THAT IS STUCK HALFWAY

26:58.041 --> 26:59.291
YOU ARE

26:59.375 --> 27:02.000
UCM
UNIVERSITY FOR THE CREATIVE ARTS MILAN

27:08.041 --> 27:09.083
Sofia?

27:09.166 --> 27:10.041
Hi.

27:18.125 --> 27:19.541
I've never done this before.

27:21.250 --> 27:23.125
-Thank you.
-See you in class.

27:40.541 --> 27:43.791
Today, I want to see you working.

27:45.500 --> 27:46.833
I want to see you writing.

27:46.916 --> 27:49.708
If you haven't already done so,
I'd like you to start

27:49.791 --> 27:52.291
your autobiographical stories here, now.

27:52.375 --> 27:57.250
I am here to help you
with any clarifications, any questions.

27:57.333 --> 27:58.791
And please, remember,

27:58.875 --> 28:00.416
no judgment!

28:01.416 --> 28:03.375
Your stories are safe here.

28:03.458 --> 28:05.666
This is a safe place.

28:06.500 --> 28:07.416
Good luck.

28:10.958 --> 28:12.708
NO JUDGMENT

28:33.041 --> 28:34.458
You don't talk much, huh?

28:34.541 --> 28:36.750
I prefer not to disturb my patients.

28:38.875 --> 28:40.166
I listen to their bodies.

28:45.583 --> 28:46.708
What does mine say?

28:47.291 --> 28:48.625
That you've gotten worse.

28:50.666 --> 28:52.625
There's a knot here that won't release.

29:02.708 --> 29:04.083
Put your hands like this,

29:04.166 --> 29:06.041
like you want to hug yourself.

29:07.583 --> 29:08.625
Turn towards me.

29:09.875 --> 29:12.291
The source of the pain is here,
on your back.

29:14.541 --> 29:16.333
It's like you're carrying a weight.

29:19.041 --> 29:20.000
A weight?

29:20.916 --> 29:22.875
Relax your muscles. They're tense.

29:28.208 --> 29:29.833
I'm not good at relaxing.

29:30.833 --> 29:31.791
Try.

29:33.833 --> 29:34.666
Trust me.

29:55.375 --> 29:56.666
Remain relaxed.

30:01.666 --> 30:03.666
Don't worry if you get dizzy.
