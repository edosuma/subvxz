01:04.031 --> 01:05.766
Yeah, if I could find it.

01:24.818 --> 01:26.154
- Fuck.
- What?

01:26.187 --> 01:27.688
It's too cold, man.

01:27.755 --> 01:29.657
Because you're a pussy.

01:38.332 --> 01:40.201
- That's pretty.
- What?

01:51.679 --> 01:52.680
Shit.

01:55.082 --> 01:56.584
What the fuck?

02:06.093 --> 02:08.529
Gabriel! Gabriel!

02:08.596 --> 02:09.863
Shit.

02:09.930 --> 02:12.300
Gabriel.Gabriel.
Look at me.

02:12.366 --> 02:13.734
- Hmm?
- Come on.

02:21.609 --> 02:23.544

How you doing?

03:43.691 --> 03:46.394
Sorry. Slim pickings.
The fat guy moved.

03:46.460 --> 03:48.762

Just leave the bottle.

04:23.764 --> 04:24.698
All right.

04:24.765 --> 04:25.765
Thanks.

04:39.146 --> 04:41.348
What the hell
are you doing? You aren't
supposed to be in here.

04:41.349 --> 04:42.416
Why not?

04:42.483 --> 04:44.452
Well, they could
lose their license.

04:44.518 --> 04:46.330
That kind of thing.
You know, the little stuff.

04:46.354 --> 04:47.921
They can only lose their license

04:47.988 --> 04:49.056
if they serve me alcohol.

04:49.122 --> 04:50.658
If they serve me food of coffee

04:50.724 --> 04:52.726
or Coke or whatever,
it's completely fine.

04:52.793 --> 04:54.695
Hey, smart aleck,
you got any money?

04:54.762 --> 04:56.397
You do.

04:56.464 --> 04:58.098
Plus, you told me
it's not illegal

04:58.165 --> 04:59.245
for a minor to sit at a bar

04:59.367 --> 05:00.410
in the state of California.

05:00.434 --> 05:01.569
You know what?

05:01.635 --> 05:03.035
I'm gonna quit
telling you anything.

05:03.070 --> 05:04.171
I try to educate you,

05:04.237 --> 05:05.715
and it bites me
in the ass every time.

05:05.739 --> 05:06.774
Swear to God.

05:08.075 --> 05:09.477
What's up, honey?

05:12.012 --> 05:13.012
Sign.

05:17.685 --> 05:19.052
You want to read it first?

05:19.119 --> 05:21.221
Well, you handed it to me.

05:21.288 --> 05:23.090
I'm assuming
it's not something bad.

05:24.592 --> 05:26.226
Why didn't your mom sign it?

05:26.293 --> 05:27.795
Didn't see her this morning.

05:28.729 --> 05:30.297
It's a trip to go back east

05:30.398 --> 05:31.499
to look at colleges.

05:31.565 --> 05:33.401
The school's organizing it.

05:37.405 --> 05:39.239
What grade are you in anyway?

05:39.306 --> 05:42.543
11th, Dad.

05:42.610 --> 05:44.044
- Yeah, well...
- 11th grade.

05:44.111 --> 05:45.946
- I remember...
- Jesus, are you serious?

05:46.013 --> 05:47.415
Yes. I know, I know.

05:47.448 --> 05:49.149
It's 11th. I'm sorry.
It's early.

05:49.216 --> 05:51.852
Ah, besides that, we know
where you're going to college.

05:51.919 --> 05:53.397
You don't need to go look
at these fucking places.

05:53.421 --> 05:54.522
I'm not going to Indiana.

05:54.588 --> 05:55.989
- Oh, yes, you are.
- Nope.

05:56.056 --> 05:57.725
You know...
You're not going to Miami.

05:57.791 --> 05:58.859
I can tell you that much.

05:58.926 --> 06:01.328
If you go to
a land-locked college,

06:01.429 --> 06:03.897
you'll study, okay?

06:03.964 --> 06:06.333
I'm not saying go to Pitt,
but I'm saying, you know...

06:06.434 --> 06:08.669
- I'm late.
- You're going
to Indiana, honey.

06:08.736 --> 06:10.270
- No.
- You know who went there

06:10.337 --> 06:11.639
besides the obvious...

06:11.705 --> 06:13.206
Ernie Pyle and Hoagy Carmichael,

06:13.273 --> 06:14.818
- Lee Majors...
- You're right.
Those are the obvious.

06:14.842 --> 06:16.544
- You like that? Bobby Knight.
- Good talk.

06:16.610 --> 06:18.979
David Anspaugh.
I could go on and on.

06:19.046 --> 06:20.247
Dick Enberg, Joe Buck...

06:20.313 --> 06:21.949
I know you could.
And you will.

06:22.015 --> 06:23.617
Jane Pauley.

06:23.684 --> 06:26.654
Jane Pauley went to Indiana.
She did okay.

06:26.720 --> 06:28.456
Where'd you go to school?

06:28.522 --> 06:30.290
I went to Northwestern.

06:30.357 --> 06:32.760
Northwestern?

06:32.826 --> 06:35.062
What the fuck
are you doing here?

06:35.128 --> 06:36.296
Didn't work out.

06:36.363 --> 06:38.131
I guess.

06:41.669 --> 06:43.737
♫ Oww ♫

06:44.605 --> 06:46.106
♫ Eh ♫

06:46.173 --> 06:48.241
♫ Uh-huh ♫

06:48.308 --> 06:50.511
♫ It's my turn ♫

06:50.578 --> 06:54.648
♫ I try to find
a certain style ♫

06:54.715 --> 06:58.719
♫ To keep my soul
from runnin' wild ♫

06:58.786 --> 07:02.155
♫ My emotions
got the best of me ♫

07:03.557 --> 07:04.925
♫ I kick and scream ♫

07:04.992 --> 07:06.960
♫ Just like a child ♫

07:07.027 --> 07:08.996
♫ I start boiling over ♫

07:09.062 --> 07:11.031
♫ My feelings
catch a flame ♫

07:11.098 --> 07:13.300
♫ I'd be a man, stay a man ♫

07:13.366 --> 07:15.102
♫ But you won't be the same ♫

07:15.168 --> 07:18.739
♫ If you ain't

07:20.007 --> 07:23.276
♫ I might just do you in ♫

♫ Oww ♫

07:35.322 --> 07:37.858
♫ Ain't it a sin ♫

07:38.859 --> 07:41.629
But he said it wasn't his drugs.

07:41.695 --> 07:43.196
Ma'am, they all say that.

07:43.263 --> 07:44.531
I mean, look around here.

07:44.532 --> 07:45.733
All these guys in here,

07:45.799 --> 07:47.267
they all say
it's not their drugs.

07:47.334 --> 07:48.602
But he wouldn't lie to me.

07:48.669 --> 07:50.070
He said they weren't his.

07:50.137 --> 07:52.339
Ma'am, I know your son's
a decent boy.

07:52.540 --> 07:53.941
I really do know that.

07:54.007 --> 07:56.009
Look, he's a young guy
in his 20s.

07:56.076 --> 07:58.546
He's got a future. We've got
to preserve that future.

07:58.612 --> 08:00.247
Am I right?

08:00.313 --> 08:01.549
What's his name?

08:01.582 --> 08:02.783
I'm sorry.

08:02.850 --> 08:04.885
What's my son's name,
Mr. McBride?

08:04.952 --> 08:06.086
Listen, if he goes to trial,

08:06.153 --> 08:08.656
he could get 15 years,
and if the judge...

08:08.722 --> 08:11.024
I asked you my son's name.

08:15.028 --> 08:17.197
I know you're upset.
I mean, why wouldn't you be?

08:17.264 --> 08:19.366
- It's natural.
- You don't even know.

08:19.432 --> 08:20.634
You haven't even met with him

08:20.701 --> 08:22.169
since he's been arraigned.

08:22.235 --> 08:24.938
You want to send him
away for five years,

08:25.005 --> 08:26.439
but you can't even be bothered

08:26.574 --> 08:27.875
to remember his name?

08:29.276 --> 08:30.978
I'm finished with you.

08:31.044 --> 08:33.881
I'm going to find someone
who gives a shit.

08:41.421 --> 08:42.956
Hey.

08:43.023 --> 08:44.256
Hey. Hi.

08:44.324 --> 08:45.759
Patty Solis-Papagian.

08:45.826 --> 08:47.127
Can I give you this?

08:47.194 --> 08:48.194
No, that's all right.

08:48.228 --> 08:49.597
Mr. McBride. Right?

08:49.663 --> 08:51.431
Are you by chance Billy McBride?

08:51.498 --> 08:52.866
Huh? The Billy McBride?

08:52.933 --> 08:54.735
Oh, my God. This is
like a fucking thrill.

08:54.802 --> 08:55.903
Patty Solis-Papagian.

08:55.969 --> 08:57.370
My office is down the street.

08:57.437 --> 08:59.339
It's above the La Fugado,
the Mexican place.

08:59.406 --> 09:02.442
I mostly do criminal, but...
Is this a good time?

09:02.509 --> 09:03.977
Uh, we can get a cup of coffee.

09:04.044 --> 09:05.846
My office is
down the street, or...

09:05.913 --> 09:07.648
Look, I got shit to do, okay?

09:07.715 --> 09:09.349
Hey, I got a civil case.

09:09.416 --> 09:12.019
A friend of mine, her brother
worked for Borns Technology,

09:12.085 --> 09:13.821
and he died
on one of their boats.

09:13.887 --> 09:15.623
Exactly. You know
where I'm headed.

09:15.656 --> 09:18.158
Your old firm's
Big Kahuna client.

09:18.225 --> 09:20.327
I'm trying to sue them,
but I don't do civil.

09:20.393 --> 09:21.705
But my friend,
she needs some help.

09:21.729 --> 09:23.130
So I sent a demand letter.

09:23.196 --> 09:25.132
I can't even get
a return call. Fuck them.

09:25.198 --> 09:28.135
Right? I'm sure you share
my sentiment there. Fuck them.

09:28.201 --> 09:31.071
Anyway, they told her that
her brother killed himself

09:31.138 --> 09:32.039
on one of their boats,

09:32.105 --> 09:33.473
but she's convinced he didn't.

09:33.540 --> 09:35.709
Now, the boat's insured,
so I figured

09:35.776 --> 09:37.811
it's gonna settle if I
can get their attention,

09:37.878 --> 09:38.979
which so far I cannot.

09:39.046 --> 09:40.413
And I figure it's gonna settle

09:40.480 --> 09:42.249
for 30, 40 grand,
and I'll give you 5

09:42.315 --> 09:44.484
if you can... you just
get me in the door,

09:44.551 --> 09:46.386
make a call. Do you
think you can do that?

09:46.453 --> 09:48.488
- Huh?
- No, I don't think
I could do that.

09:48.555 --> 09:50.390
But I already have
the paperwork.

09:50.457 --> 09:52.159
All you have to do
is fill it out.

09:53.661 --> 09:54.862
God damn it.

09:56.697 --> 09:58.832
Listen, lady, I'm
nervous enough already,

09:58.899 --> 10:00.033
and you're a fucking yapper.

10:00.100 --> 10:01.669
I don't do good
with yappers, so...

10:01.735 --> 10:03.446
You don't want to try
to fuck over your old firm?

10:03.470 --> 10:05.105
Really?

10:05.172 --> 10:06.439
Wow.

10:06.506 --> 10:07.941
I would.

10:10.343 --> 10:13.380
As big and powerful
as we've become

10:13.446 --> 10:15.783
at Cooperman and McBride,

10:15.849 --> 10:18.886
one thing has not changed.

10:18.952 --> 10:20.253
We are still committed

10:20.320 --> 10:23.390
to serving our clients
and our community.

10:23.456 --> 10:27.127
The only difference is
the size of our community.

10:27.194 --> 10:29.830
When I first started
at Cooperman and McBride,

10:29.897 --> 10:31.999
we were a regional practice.

10:32.065 --> 10:34.835
We used to joke that we were
the In n Out of law firms:

10:34.902 --> 10:39.072
great product, better service,
and lower prices.

10:39.139 --> 10:43.110
Today we have
over a thousand lawyers

10:43.176 --> 10:46.546
in offices across the country
and the globe,

10:46.613 --> 10:49.082
and revenue last year

10:49.149 --> 10:51.885
of $2.1 billion.

10:54.955 --> 10:57.157
We've come a long way
in a short time.

10:57.224 --> 10:59.526
And the future has
never been brighter.

10:59.592 --> 11:01.895
Our reach has
never been greater.

11:01.962 --> 11:07.234
That includes our newest
branch office in Qatar.

11:07.300 --> 11:10.637
I know I speak for our
founder Donald Cooperman

11:10.738 --> 11:12.372
when I say...

11:15.408 --> 11:17.210
Welcome to the firm.

11:17.277 --> 11:18.411
Welcome.

11:42.669 --> 11:44.805
Say, Frankie, what's the...
what's the thing

11:44.872 --> 11:46.639
that's half man, half horse?

11:46.774 --> 11:48.675
You got me.

11:48.776 --> 11:51.478
Centaur. Centaur.
That's what it was.

11:51.544 --> 11:53.013
Hey.

11:53.080 --> 11:54.848
Was she here last night,
by any chance?

11:54.915 --> 11:57.484
- Who's that?
- Our daughter. 16.

11:57.550 --> 11:58.786
5'6", medium build.

11:58.852 --> 12:01.421
Smart ass.
No, she wasn't.

12:01.488 --> 12:02.655
She told me she was sleeping

12:02.790 --> 12:03.967
at a girl friend's house
last night.

12:03.991 --> 12:05.158
When I called this morning,

12:05.225 --> 12:06.569
the girl didn't know
anything about it.

12:06.593 --> 12:07.794
So she's missing.

12:07.795 --> 12:09.830
She showed up at school.
She's fine.

12:09.897 --> 12:12.332
- So she wasn't with you.
- No.

12:12.399 --> 12:13.801
Fine.

12:13.867 --> 12:15.936
Might be a good idea
to unblock my calls

12:16.003 --> 12:17.537
in case she goes missing again.

12:17.604 --> 12:20.040
Oh, so because I... I don't
unblock your calls,

12:20.107 --> 12:22.342
somehow I'm involved.
What does that even mean?

12:22.409 --> 12:24.411
You fuck up, let her
go missing or something...

12:24.477 --> 12:26.814
Don't you ever get sick
of this? I'm sick of this.

12:26.847 --> 12:29.349
- Sick of what?
- This.

12:29.416 --> 12:31.084
No, not of this.

12:36.323 --> 12:39.192
He was already drunk.
I kid you not.

12:39.259 --> 12:41.829
And this isn't me
just ripping on my ex.

12:41.895 --> 12:44.664
This was one of the best
trial lawyers ever.

12:44.731 --> 12:46.867
How did he look,
on a scale of 1 to shit?

12:46.934 --> 12:48.401
Not horrible, to be honest.

12:48.468 --> 12:50.103
Did you have something to say?

12:50.170 --> 12:52.081
I was just conferring
with my client, Your Honor.

12:52.105 --> 12:54.474
Yes, while I was talking,
which I find rude.

12:54.541 --> 12:55.642
Uh-oh.

12:55.708 --> 12:56.886
Was it your intent to be rude?

12:56.910 --> 12:58.545
No. N...

13:01.348 --> 13:02.549
No, Your Honor.

13:02.615 --> 13:03.750
Oh, shit.

13:03.851 --> 13:06.086
I thought she was over that.

13:06.153 --> 13:07.153
So did I.

13:31.879 --> 13:33.881
- Hey, Lucy.
- Hello.

13:45.225 --> 13:46.326
Hey.

13:46.393 --> 13:48.228
Hey.

13:48.295 --> 13:49.662
I'm sorry.

13:49.729 --> 13:54.067
I got nervous, and...

13:54.134 --> 13:56.436
I... I apologize.

13:56.503 --> 13:58.405
No need to apologize.

14:00.540 --> 14:01.975
So the cognitive therapy...

14:02.042 --> 14:05.545
It's going well.
I've been symptom-free.

14:05.612 --> 14:08.815
I just... got nervous,

14:08.916 --> 14:11.351
and it won't happen again.

14:11.418 --> 14:12.452
Mm.

14:12.519 --> 14:14.221
It won't.

14:16.756 --> 14:17.925
Okay.

14:20.493 --> 14:22.095
Okay.

14:22.162 --> 14:23.163
Lucy.

14:24.564 --> 14:25.564
Come in.

14:27.935 --> 14:29.102
You should know

14:29.169 --> 14:32.472
that I've been getting
a little feedback

14:32.539 --> 14:35.308
that your attitude

14:35.375 --> 14:38.845
falls short of what we expect.

14:38.946 --> 14:40.447
Okay.

14:40.513 --> 14:43.683
Uh, who has complained
about my attitude?

14:43.750 --> 14:45.452
I'm not at liberty to say.

14:45.518 --> 14:48.388
Uhh.

14:48.455 --> 14:51.124
And while we're on
the subject of liberty,

14:51.191 --> 14:53.994
do I get the right
to confront my accusers?

14:54.061 --> 14:55.996
You see?
That question itself

14:56.063 --> 14:58.365
reflects a certain
attitude deficit.

14:58.431 --> 15:00.300
I don't believe you.

15:00.367 --> 15:01.201
I'm sorry?

15:01.268 --> 15:02.669
That people have complained

15:02.735 --> 15:04.304
about my attitude.

15:04.371 --> 15:06.273
This is an employment
at will business,

15:06.339 --> 15:11.044
and you can fire me on a whim
with very few exceptions,

15:11.111 --> 15:13.013
stuttering being one of them.

15:13.080 --> 15:16.049
Since it's been categorized
as a psych disorder,

15:16.116 --> 15:17.784
I'd actually have recourse

15:17.850 --> 15:20.887
under the Federal
Disabilities Act,

15:20.988 --> 15:26.359
and you would be
f-f-fucked.

15:28.428 --> 15:30.297
Okay, I like that.

15:40.440 --> 15:43.110
I wish you wouldn't
look at me like that.

15:43.176 --> 15:45.578
I haven't eaten a fucking
thing all day long.

15:45.645 --> 15:48.848
Why don't you go
somewhere else to get...

15:48.915 --> 15:50.417
God damn it.

15:52.685 --> 15:55.022
Okay. Come on. Here.

15:56.223 --> 15:57.490
There you go.

16:04.331 --> 16:06.566
They don't let you bring
your own food in here.

16:06.633 --> 16:08.601
Oh. Are you Billy McBride?

16:08.668 --> 16:09.602
Yep.

16:09.669 --> 16:13.040
Uh, my neighbor
is Patty Solis-Papagian.

16:13.073 --> 16:14.374
Oh, you mean that chatty chick?

16:14.441 --> 16:17.144
She told me you guys talked

16:17.210 --> 16:19.579
about you maybe
handling my case.

16:20.880 --> 16:23.416
My brother died in a boating
accident two years ago.

16:23.483 --> 16:24.851
Yeah, she's a real motor mouth.

16:28.055 --> 16:30.157
He did, he battled
some depression,

16:30.223 --> 16:31.591
but he'd never kill himself.

16:31.658 --> 16:33.793
He had a son,

16:33.860 --> 16:35.628
and he was a great dad.

16:35.695 --> 16:37.964
Plus, why do it on a boat?

16:38.065 --> 16:40.833
It seems like a lot of trouble
to go through, don't you think?

16:40.900 --> 16:44.071
Not if the boat's insured.

16:44.137 --> 16:45.438
Three days before he died,

16:45.505 --> 16:49.209
he talked about a need
to redeem himself.

16:49.276 --> 16:50.943
It's not suicide talk.

16:51.078 --> 16:52.679
Redeem himself from what?

16:52.745 --> 16:54.881
The company he worked for

16:54.947 --> 16:56.516
had a lot of military contracts.

16:56.583 --> 16:58.751
It was their boat that exploded,

16:58.818 --> 17:00.087
which begs the question

17:00.153 --> 17:03.090
what was he doing by himself
on a boat at night?

17:03.156 --> 17:05.125
Maybe to blow himself up.

17:06.893 --> 17:08.395
- Sorry.
- No.

17:08.461 --> 17:11.098
Look, my brother would
never kill himself.

17:11.131 --> 17:12.531
Something else
happened out there,

17:12.598 --> 17:15.602
and I think his son
deserves to know the truth.

17:20.173 --> 17:21.540
I Googled you, you know.

17:22.809 --> 17:24.111
- You did?
- Yeah.

17:24.176 --> 17:26.113
It said you used to be
a big shot.

17:26.146 --> 17:28.381
Hmm. I don't know
about that.

17:28.448 --> 17:29.216
Mm-hmm.

17:29.282 --> 17:30.750
Did Google happen to say

17:30.817 --> 17:33.753
what became of me?
Because I'd love to know.

17:35.122 --> 17:36.223
That you drink too much.

17:36.289 --> 17:38.125
That's not accurate.

17:39.659 --> 17:41.828
I drink just the right amount.

17:41.894 --> 17:43.430
I don't mean to judge.

17:43.496 --> 17:45.398
It's all right. No sweat.

17:46.499 --> 17:48.501
I'm am esthetician by trade.

17:48.568 --> 17:50.303
- No shit.
- Mm-hmm.

17:51.771 --> 17:53.640
And you got a nice face.

17:54.807 --> 17:56.443
- Please.
- You do.

17:57.477 --> 18:00.147
Considering
the booze and smoking

18:00.180 --> 18:01.748
- and stuff.
- Mm.

18:01.814 --> 18:02.815
I don't...

18:04.417 --> 18:06.195
I don't think you're
supposed to smoke in here.

18:06.219 --> 18:08.155
- I'm not.
- Uh-huh.

18:12.659 --> 18:13.659
Ahem.

18:15.995 --> 18:17.330
Done that before?

18:17.397 --> 18:18.931
- Yeah, a few times.
- Mm-hmm.

18:18.998 --> 18:20.200
What are they going to do?

18:20.267 --> 18:22.435
- No, they know me.
- Oh, good.

18:22.502 --> 18:24.170
Not that they like it.

18:24.171 --> 18:26.172
But you can't
bring your pizza in.

18:26.173 --> 18:27.774
- No.
- Okay.

18:45.758 --> 18:48.195
Ohh! Ohh!

20:04.604 --> 20:06.839
Announcer: The west...

20:06.906 --> 20:08.875
land of the free,

20:08.941 --> 20:10.510
home of the brave.

20:12.579 --> 20:15.415
We've been part of it
for 75 years...

20:15.482 --> 20:16.716
Rosie the Riveter steps in

20:16.783 --> 20:18.184
when the draftees step out.

20:18.251 --> 20:20.086
...serving our country,

20:20.152 --> 20:22.989
building our family,

20:23.055 --> 20:25.492
protecting what counts...

20:25.558 --> 20:29.296
the men and women of Borns Tech,

20:29.362 --> 20:31.898
from the southland to the stars,

20:31.964 --> 20:33.300
together.

21:24.116 --> 21:25.652
Ahem.

21:28.020 --> 21:29.722
- Good morning.
- Hey.

21:29.789 --> 21:32.459
I was just going
to go make some coffee.

21:32.525 --> 21:33.726
You, uh, you want some?

21:35.194 --> 21:37.029
Okay.

21:37.096 --> 21:39.231
How about I was going
to go on the porch

21:39.366 --> 21:41.934
and stare at the sun?

21:43.269 --> 21:44.971
All right. Uh...

21:45.037 --> 21:46.506
Mm-hmm?

21:46.573 --> 21:48.508
So listen, Rachel,

21:48.575 --> 21:50.109
I just want to tell you that...

21:50.176 --> 21:53.012
No, no. We don't have to talk.
It's okay, seriously.

21:53.079 --> 21:54.847
I think I'd prefer it.

21:59.151 --> 22:01.854
Well, it's just that I'm
not very good with stuff.

22:01.921 --> 22:02.755
You know.

22:02.822 --> 22:05.825
You know,
you started a big firm,

22:05.892 --> 22:07.727
and they didn't take
your name off of it,

22:07.794 --> 22:11.230
so you must have
snowed a lot of people

22:11.297 --> 22:13.933
into thinking that you
were good at stuff.

22:14.000 --> 22:15.568
Was that on Google, too?

22:16.503 --> 22:17.770
That shit creeps me out,

22:17.837 --> 22:21.140
that people can know things
about you like that.

22:21.207 --> 22:22.442
- It's so easy, huh?
- Right.

22:22.509 --> 22:24.010
Just that anybody can fucking

22:24.076 --> 22:26.979
- know everything about you.
- Right.

22:27.046 --> 22:29.181
I don't like that.

22:29.248 --> 22:31.418
Buy you a drink.

22:34.587 --> 22:37.189
If you want one,
I'll go with you.

22:37.256 --> 22:38.324
Okay.

22:38.425 --> 22:40.693
The least I can do
for a new client.

22:43.463 --> 22:45.031
Well, I'll let you
get dressed, then.

23:20.733 --> 23:21.868
Uh...

23:22.935 --> 23:24.571
Ms. Larson?
How are you doing?

23:24.637 --> 23:27.273
My name's Billy McBride.
I'm an attorney.

23:27.339 --> 23:28.608
You must love it out here,

23:28.675 --> 23:30.142
right here on the canal.

23:30.209 --> 23:31.511
W-What's this about?

23:32.612 --> 23:33.880
It's about your late husband.

23:33.946 --> 23:35.482
There's some new information.

23:35.515 --> 23:37.125
I thought you might want
to talk about it with me.

23:37.149 --> 23:39.351
- What new information?
- Rachel, your sister-in-law,

23:39.486 --> 23:40.820
she's a client of mine,

23:40.887 --> 23:42.922
and she's pretty sure
Ryan didn't kill himself.

23:42.989 --> 23:44.090
That's not new.

23:44.156 --> 23:46.292
She's been saying
that bullshit for years.

23:46.358 --> 23:48.127
My sister-in-law...

23:49.361 --> 23:50.563
Ryan was her only sibling,

23:50.630 --> 23:52.031
maybe her only friend.

23:52.098 --> 23:53.866
She can't let it go.

23:53.933 --> 23:55.478
- She's a lovely woman...
- I'm sorry, ma'am.

23:55.502 --> 23:56.679
I'm having
a hard time hearing you.

23:56.703 --> 23:58.004
- Do you mind...
- Excuse me.

23:58.070 --> 23:59.371
Thank you. Move back.

23:59.506 --> 24:01.107
Sure.

24:01.173 --> 24:02.509
Here's my card

24:02.542 --> 24:04.276
just to prove that I'm
actually an attorney.

24:04.343 --> 24:05.578
Sorry about the scratch marks.

24:05.645 --> 24:06.813
I recently changed locations.

24:06.879 --> 24:09.015
I'm not some sort
of gardener rapist

24:09.081 --> 24:10.116
or anything like that.

24:10.182 --> 24:11.884
You know, I agree with you.

24:11.951 --> 24:13.519
Rachel, she can be
kind of out there,

24:13.520 --> 24:15.622
but part of my job
is client control,

24:15.688 --> 24:17.523
and if there's no case,
I'd like to be able

24:17.524 --> 24:19.125
to go back and tell her that.

24:19.191 --> 24:20.226
There's no case.

24:20.292 --> 24:21.292
Okay.

24:22.629 --> 24:24.531
It's just awfully strange

24:24.597 --> 24:26.432
for a boat to just
explode just like that.

24:26.533 --> 24:27.834
- Isn't it?
- Maybe less so

24:27.900 --> 24:29.602
when you drop a match
into the fuel tank.

24:29.669 --> 24:31.780
Is that what
you think happened?
A match in the fuel tank?

24:31.804 --> 24:33.072
It's what I was told happened.

24:33.139 --> 24:34.349
- When were you told that?
- When?

24:34.373 --> 24:35.742
Right after.

24:35.808 --> 24:37.910
- Who told you?
- I don't recall.

24:40.847 --> 24:42.982
What was he doing out
there at night anyway?

24:43.049 --> 24:44.717
- He loved to fish.
- Hmm.

24:44.784 --> 24:46.452
They would let him
take the boats out.

24:46.553 --> 24:48.020
Sometimes he took our boy.

24:48.087 --> 24:50.422
My husband was a very
loyal employee.

24:50.557 --> 24:51.991
They make bombs, and he blew up.

24:52.058 --> 24:54.060
Don't you think that's
kind of a coincidence?

24:54.126 --> 24:56.428
I mean, to me it's
downright suspicious.

24:56.563 --> 24:58.798
Now, did they happen
to give you any money

24:58.865 --> 25:00.567
as a result of this coincidence?

25:00.600 --> 25:02.134
What are you doing,
Mr. McBride?

25:02.201 --> 25:04.003
I'm just doing my job.
I'm trying to find out

25:04.070 --> 25:06.739
why a guy like Ryan
would kill himself

25:06.806 --> 25:11.110
in such a weird, loud,
messy kind of way.

25:11.177 --> 25:12.244
Uh, it's...

25:12.311 --> 25:13.813
Borns Tech was
very good to Ryan.

25:13.880 --> 25:15.848
They've been wonderful to me.

25:15.915 --> 25:17.750
- They set up a fund...
- What's up, buddy?

25:17.817 --> 25:19.018
...to pay
for the funeral.

25:19.085 --> 25:20.086
How you doing?

25:20.152 --> 25:21.587
I'm a friend of
your aunt Rachel's.

25:21.588 --> 25:22.798
- Stop it.
- I'm just talking to your mom

25:22.822 --> 25:24.624
about how you used
to fish with your dad.

25:24.691 --> 25:26.134
- Stop it.
- That must have
been cool, huh?

25:26.158 --> 25:28.094
You know something about my dad?

25:28.160 --> 25:31.330
This is a private
conversation, Jason.

25:31.397 --> 25:32.599
Just go into your room.

25:32.632 --> 25:34.601
Nice meeting you there, Jason.

25:35.501 --> 25:36.502
Listen here,

25:36.603 --> 25:38.204
you fucking weird asshole,

25:38.270 --> 25:41.708
the idea of you and my
fucked-up sister-in-law

25:41.774 --> 25:44.010
tearing open wounds to chase
some big pot of gold...

25:44.076 --> 25:45.712
I'm chasing the truth,
Ms. Larson.

25:45.778 --> 25:47.122
- That's all I'm doing.
- Bullshit.

25:47.146 --> 25:49.248
Aren't you interested
in the truth?

25:49.315 --> 25:51.984
This was a very painful time,

25:52.051 --> 25:53.620
very painful.

25:54.621 --> 25:56.823
And I'm not going back there.

25:56.889 --> 25:58.925
Okay? So I think
you should go.

25:58.991 --> 26:00.660
Go. Thank you.

26:00.727 --> 26:02.161
I hear you. Okay.

26:03.630 --> 26:05.031
You have a good day.

26:20.713 --> 26:22.548
You have the settlement
conference

26:22.649 --> 26:23.849
with the Chancery court at 10.

26:24.817 --> 26:26.118
Davidson board meeting at noon.

26:27.119 --> 26:28.554
Your plane leaves
from Santa Monica

26:28.655 --> 26:29.756
at 3.

26:29.822 --> 26:31.724
Gina Larson called.

26:31.791 --> 26:33.125
Billy McBride

26:33.192 --> 26:34.293
visited her.

26:59.251 --> 27:00.186
What's up, guys?

27:00.252 --> 27:01.687
You doing a little
night fishing?

27:01.688 --> 27:02.789
Get after those sharks?

27:02.855 --> 27:04.857
- We don't do charters.
- No shit.

27:04.924 --> 27:06.793
The guys up at the tackle
shop said you did.

27:06.859 --> 27:08.728
- Huh.
- Well, we don't.

27:08.795 --> 27:10.229
Yeah? You thirsty?

27:10.296 --> 27:12.699
- No, thanks.
- What do you want?

27:12.732 --> 27:14.767
Okay, look, I'll just
cut the shit right now.

27:14.834 --> 27:16.068
The night your boat sank,

27:16.135 --> 27:17.704
you told OSHA that it was calm,

27:17.737 --> 27:19.939
there was an explosion,
and a wave sank it.

27:20.006 --> 27:21.774
That's a load
of fucking horse shit,

27:21.841 --> 27:23.418
- and you know it.
- Man, what do you want?

27:23.442 --> 27:24.711
You got a computer?
Look it up.

27:24.777 --> 27:27.379
Explosions on a boat
can sink them,

27:27.446 --> 27:29.048
like a torpedo or whatever.

27:29.115 --> 27:30.983
Explosions near a boat
can sink them, too,

27:31.050 --> 27:32.752
like a mine putting
a hole in the hull,

27:32.819 --> 27:33.819
that kind of thing.

27:33.853 --> 27:35.087
But it would goddamn near

27:35.154 --> 27:36.856
take a nuclear bomb
to make a wave

27:36.923 --> 27:38.524
big enough to sink a boat.

27:38.590 --> 27:40.002
So either you're a hell
of a lot closer

27:40.026 --> 27:42.161
to that explosion
than you told OSHA,

27:42.228 --> 27:44.964
or you're lying about
what the fuck happened.

27:45.031 --> 27:47.033
- You calling us liars?
- Yeah, I am.

27:47.099 --> 27:48.534
Why do you got to fuck with us?

27:48.600 --> 27:50.336
I don't got to fuck with you.

27:50.402 --> 27:51.804
But I got a feeling

27:51.871 --> 27:53.515
the insurance company
would be pretty pissed off

27:53.539 --> 27:55.041
if they knew you lied to them.

27:55.107 --> 27:56.575
So you got a kitchen or a cabin

27:56.642 --> 27:57.953
or whatever you
call it on this rig?

27:57.977 --> 27:59.178
Let's go drink some beer.

27:59.245 --> 28:00.612
Come on. It's free.

28:00.747 --> 28:02.581
What are you waiting for?

28:02.648 --> 28:04.751
Let's go be pals and shit.

28:09.756 --> 28:11.858
You guys have yourselves
that beer. It's for you.

28:11.924 --> 28:14.460
I'm a lightweight.
I'm not much of a drinker.

28:14.526 --> 28:15.761
Thanks a lot.

28:15.762 --> 28:17.096
But, uh, you know, I got to say

28:17.163 --> 28:20.199
I'm still just a little bit, uh,

28:20.266 --> 28:22.368
in the dark about all this shit

28:22.434 --> 28:23.970
because you're saying

28:24.036 --> 28:25.437
that there's flaming shit

28:25.504 --> 28:27.115
and the boat didn't sink,
the boat did sink.

28:27.139 --> 28:28.619
There was a wave,
there wasn't a wave.

28:28.674 --> 28:30.676
I don't know.
So the boat didn't sink.

28:30.777 --> 28:31.677
Listen to me, okay?

28:31.778 --> 28:32.879
It sank.

28:32.945 --> 28:34.814
- It did sink.
- Yes.

28:35.782 --> 28:37.316
But it also burned up, man.

28:37.383 --> 28:39.118
Would you just tell him, please?

28:39.185 --> 28:41.620
You talk too fucking much.

28:41.687 --> 28:43.122
Okay, I'm still confused.

28:43.189 --> 28:44.556
You told the insurance company

28:44.623 --> 28:45.892
that the boat didn't sink,

28:45.958 --> 28:47.559
that the wave had
nothing to do with it.

28:47.626 --> 28:49.128
No, but the... Look,

28:49.195 --> 28:51.563
we told them there was
a big wave, right?

28:51.630 --> 28:54.901
But then all this flaming shit
started hitting the deck, man.

28:54.967 --> 28:56.468
All right?
And that shit was hot.

28:56.535 --> 28:58.037
I'll bet.

28:58.104 --> 29:00.139
And the insurance company
didn't ask you

29:00.206 --> 29:03.242
where the fire came from
or what it was or anything?

29:03.309 --> 29:05.577
We told them
about the explosion.

29:05.644 --> 29:07.013
They figured it came from that,

29:07.079 --> 29:08.323
but they didn't ask
about it, no.

29:08.347 --> 29:10.182
And you didn't think
that was weird?

29:10.249 --> 29:11.383
What's weird? Huh?

29:11.450 --> 29:13.452
Why did Borns Tech's
insurance pay you off?

29:13.519 --> 29:14.686
Why not your insurance?

29:14.821 --> 29:16.155
We didn't have any insurance.

29:16.222 --> 29:17.862
- Would you shut the fuck up?
- It's true.

29:17.924 --> 29:19.691
Look, man,
the insurance guy spent

29:19.826 --> 29:21.069
maybe ten minutes talking to us.

29:21.093 --> 29:22.461
Next week we had the check.

29:22.528 --> 29:24.831
- That's it.
- Come here a second, guys.

29:30.569 --> 29:31.737
Ten minutes, huh?

29:31.838 --> 29:33.405
- Yeah, man.
- Yeah.

29:33.472 --> 29:35.141
Well, that's what's weird.

29:37.143 --> 29:39.611
You see, insurance
companies make their money

29:39.678 --> 29:41.981
by not paying you.

29:42.048 --> 29:43.808
I mean, hell, they don't
even want to pay you

29:43.850 --> 29:45.451
when they owe it to you.

29:45.517 --> 29:47.353
And here they just wrote
you a fucking check,

29:47.419 --> 29:49.321
- just like that.
- Yeah. They could afford it.

29:49.388 --> 29:50.589
Yeah?

29:50.656 --> 29:52.091
Plus,

29:52.158 --> 29:53.359
we were entitled to it.

29:53.425 --> 29:54.526
Thank you.

29:59.365 --> 30:00.432
Hey, Nicole.

30:00.499 --> 30:01.934
You can go right in.

30:02.001 --> 30:03.870
Everything okay?

30:03.936 --> 30:05.804
You can go in.

30:34.901 --> 30:37.836
Donald. You asked to see me?

30:40.606 --> 30:42.875
Do you remember Leonard Letts,

30:42.942 --> 30:44.576
general counsel in Borns Tech?

30:44.643 --> 30:45.945
Yes, of course.

30:46.012 --> 30:48.114
Your ex-husband went to see
Gina Larson yesterday.

30:49.315 --> 30:51.884
Okay. I give up.
Who's Gina Larson?

30:51.951 --> 30:53.185
Like you don't know.

30:53.252 --> 30:54.720
I don't.

30:54.786 --> 30:56.722
Widow of Ryan Larson,

30:56.788 --> 30:58.828
one of our employees who died
in a boating accident.

30:58.925 --> 31:00.226
What do you know about this?

31:00.292 --> 31:01.327
Nothing.

31:01.393 --> 31:03.162
Your ex is circling his wagons

31:03.229 --> 31:04.363
to sue your biggest client,

31:04.430 --> 31:05.764
and you have no fucking inkling?

31:05.831 --> 31:07.199
Excuse me?

31:07.266 --> 31:08.576
Are you always this
unflappable, Leonard?

31:08.600 --> 31:09.969
This is a DOD contract.

31:10.036 --> 31:12.171
If Wall Street gets wind
of even a potential claim,

31:12.238 --> 31:13.739
a core descent
decline in stock...

31:13.805 --> 31:15.005
that's
a billion-dollar-plus...

31:15.975 --> 31:17.576
If he does file a claim,

31:17.643 --> 31:18.945
it'll be wrongful death.

31:18.978 --> 31:21.180
Let's begin drafting a response.

31:23.515 --> 31:25.217
Have the mouse write it.

31:25.284 --> 31:27.053
- Really?
- Who's the mouse?

31:27.119 --> 31:29.956
She's our best drafter,
and fast.

31:30.957 --> 31:31.991
On paper.

31:32.058 --> 31:33.392
She's also a second year
associate

31:33.459 --> 31:35.794
We have better,
more experienced people...

31:37.029 --> 31:39.498
I asked for the mouse.

31:43.135 --> 31:45.171
Excuse me, gentlemen.

31:53.545 --> 31:56.415
Me? Y...

31:56.482 --> 31:59.685
Donald Cooperman asked
for me specifically?

31:59.751 --> 32:01.353
We haven't been sued yet,

32:01.420 --> 32:04.190
but we want to be ready
in case they file.

32:04.256 --> 32:06.492
And throw in a counterclaim
for abuse of process,

32:06.558 --> 32:09.128
malicious prosecution,
whatever you can think of.

32:09.195 --> 32:11.563
The idea is to rip
this guy a new asshole

32:11.630 --> 32:14.300
and make him think twice
before ever suing us again.

32:14.366 --> 32:15.767
That's actually not the idea.

32:15.834 --> 32:17.269
Do not hold back,
do you hear me?

32:17.336 --> 32:19.705
I want a shock and awe
shit show.

32:19.771 --> 32:21.507
Should this man sue us,

32:21.573 --> 32:23.109
he needs to regret it.

32:31.383 --> 32:32.784
You okay?

32:32.851 --> 32:35.121
Am I okay? This is awesome.

32:36.788 --> 32:38.224
Great.

32:38.290 --> 32:39.558
Enjoy.

32:43.029 --> 32:44.763
Ohh.

32:44.830 --> 32:47.032
It's good.
It's part of my whole,

32:47.033 --> 32:48.434
like, spiritual journey,
you know?

32:48.500 --> 32:50.569
I've got a guru.
He's not really a guru.

32:50.636 --> 32:52.838
He's also a hairdresser,
but he's really, like,

32:52.904 --> 32:54.106
kind of deep and intelligent.

32:54.173 --> 32:55.407
Excuse me. Miss Gold?

32:55.474 --> 32:58.510
Uh, Lieutenant Stone Phallus
with the LAPD.

32:58.577 --> 33:00.255
I'm going to need to talk
to you for a minute.

33:00.279 --> 33:02.414
Thank you, sir.
Uh, Miss Gold...

33:02.481 --> 33:05.651
Oh, hello, Detective Phallus.

33:05.717 --> 33:07.353
How are you, honey?

33:07.419 --> 33:08.954
I'm great. How are you, Billy?

33:09.055 --> 33:11.690
Not bad. Sorry I chased
your prey off there.

33:11.757 --> 33:14.660
Oh, don't be sorry.
I'm just paying my rent.

33:14.726 --> 33:17.529
Hey, listen, I got a case,
pretty big case,

33:17.596 --> 33:20.065
and, uh... Come on, honey.
Just hear me out.

33:20.066 --> 33:22.068
I really need you
on this one, okay?

33:22.134 --> 33:23.411
- I just need some help...
- Billy. Billy!

33:23.435 --> 33:24.746
...with the pleadings
and so forth.

33:24.770 --> 33:26.638
How long am I going to be
on the hook for this?

33:26.705 --> 33:28.507
Look, can... can I just...
can we go upstairs?

33:28.574 --> 33:30.376
I can give you
a couple of blow jobs,

33:30.442 --> 33:31.886
- and then we'll be even.
- You shitting me?

33:31.910 --> 33:34.513
The sentence they were
going to hand down to you.

33:34.580 --> 33:37.483
You're going to need
a whole lot more than
two blow jobs, okay?

33:37.549 --> 33:39.985
Besides that, this is
a pretty good case here,

33:40.086 --> 33:42.088
and you're probably
going to get paid.

33:42.121 --> 33:43.289
Really?

33:43.355 --> 33:45.091
- Yeah. I'm serious.
- Mm-hmm.

33:46.958 --> 33:48.494
Good legal help's hard to find.

33:48.560 --> 33:51.097
Blow jobs are easy.
Come on, honey.

33:52.798 --> 33:53.799
Please?

33:53.865 --> 33:55.334
Okay, a couple days.

33:55.401 --> 33:56.735
Yeah, we'll figure it out.

33:56.802 --> 33:57.802
You promise?

33:57.836 --> 33:59.004
We'll figure it out.

33:59.105 --> 34:01.006
Can we just go upstairs
for five minutes?

34:01.107 --> 34:02.417
I swear to God
it'll be really great.

34:02.441 --> 34:04.241
- We can take a bottle...
- I don't need that.

34:08.880 --> 34:11.550
Authorities
believe a malfunction
in the boat's fuel line

34:11.617 --> 34:13.185
may have triggered the blast.

34:13.252 --> 34:14.853
A number of folks
have called 911,

34:14.920 --> 34:16.422
concerned that there
was a plane crash

34:16.487 --> 34:18.023
or terrorist attack.

34:18.123 --> 34:20.126
The victim, identified
as Ryan Larson,

34:20.192 --> 34:22.561
is survived by his wife
and young child.

34:22.628 --> 34:25.130
There were no other injuries
or vessels involved.

34:25.164 --> 34:27.733
So far there are
no other details.

34:40.812 --> 34:41.913
You.

34:41.980 --> 34:43.315
You motherfucker.

34:43.382 --> 34:45.217
I send you a bona fide referral,

34:45.284 --> 34:47.253
and you fuck her?

34:47.319 --> 34:49.321
You want to hold it down?
We're in a public place.

34:49.388 --> 34:51.223
I want to beat the shit
out of you right now.

34:51.290 --> 34:52.623
Wouldn't do any good.

34:52.690 --> 34:54.569
I've had the shit beat
out of me a lot of times.

34:54.592 --> 34:56.495
I just replenish with more shit.

34:56.562 --> 34:58.730
I'm sorry. Do you think
you're funny?

34:58.797 --> 35:01.933
This is like Ethics 101:
fucking clients.

35:02.000 --> 35:04.970
- Did you want something?
- I don't want anything at all.

35:05.036 --> 35:06.405
Should I report you to the Bar?

35:06.472 --> 35:07.573
That's been done, too.

35:07.639 --> 35:09.575
You really are
an asshole, aren't you?

35:09.641 --> 35:10.709
Yeah, maybe so,

35:10.776 --> 35:12.578
but let's focus on
something productive here.

35:12.644 --> 35:13.921
You sure you don't
want anything?

35:13.945 --> 35:15.481
Please worry about yourself.

35:15.547 --> 35:18.184
I think your friend has a case.

35:18.250 --> 35:20.186
I went and saw
the dead guy's wife.

35:20.252 --> 35:22.221
- Really?
- Yeah, really.

35:22.288 --> 35:25.991
She's hiding something.
I'm sure of it.

35:26.057 --> 35:28.560
I think there's
a bigger picture here.

35:28.627 --> 35:31.663
I... I don't care
about the bigger picture

35:31.730 --> 35:34.833
or secrets or... or who's
sleeping with who,

35:34.900 --> 35:36.435
unless it's you
sleeping with Rachel

35:36.502 --> 35:38.036
because that shit
really pisses me off.

35:38.103 --> 35:41.707
All I care about is getting
a settlement for 30 grand,

35:41.773 --> 35:45.076
which, when I get,
you get 5. Okay?

35:45.211 --> 35:48.013
No, no, no. No.

35:48.079 --> 35:51.783
No. Don't look at me like
you're gonna be fucking me.

35:51.850 --> 35:53.252
Okay?

35:53.319 --> 35:55.487
Because I'm not
a fuckable person.

35:56.522 --> 35:58.390
Somehow I don't doubt that.

36:20.312 --> 36:22.147
- I like that.
- Yeah.

36:22.248 --> 36:23.549
Yeah, it's fun.

37:04.055 --> 37:05.391
No.

37:07.192 --> 37:09.895
No, just file the papers
tomorrow.

37:09.961 --> 37:12.298
Yes. That will be fine.

37:13.299 --> 37:14.700
Okay.

37:14.766 --> 37:16.435
I appreciate it.

37:16.502 --> 37:18.304
Thank you so much.

37:23.575 --> 37:25.911
Fuck. What are you
doing here?

37:25.977 --> 37:28.514
I think I kind of broke
your gate a little

37:28.580 --> 37:30.015
when I came in. Sorry.

37:30.081 --> 37:31.350
What?

37:33.018 --> 37:34.018
What's up?

37:35.354 --> 37:36.922
Where's Denise?

37:36.988 --> 37:39.525
She's at tutoring, I think.

37:41.427 --> 37:43.395
What are you doing here?

37:43.462 --> 37:45.431
So I guess you're not
gonna invite me in.

37:45.497 --> 37:49.401
Come on.
I'm so tired.

37:50.836 --> 37:51.836
What do you want?

37:52.904 --> 37:55.206
Borns Tech, are they
good guys or bad guys?

37:55.341 --> 37:57.476
Neither. They're clients.

37:57.543 --> 38:00.245
We don't divide up between
good guys and bad guys.

38:00.346 --> 38:01.947
Well, I got a case against them,

38:02.013 --> 38:03.349
so that means I got a case

38:03.415 --> 38:05.183
against Cooperman & McBride.

38:05.250 --> 38:06.985
Heard anything about it?

38:07.052 --> 38:08.687
Don't ask me that.

38:10.756 --> 38:13.492
Well, today I went out to see
a witness on this thing,

38:13.559 --> 38:16.361
and, uh, had to take
an Uber over here

38:16.362 --> 38:18.063
because somebody
dumped fish guts

38:18.129 --> 38:19.264
all over my car.

38:19.365 --> 38:20.499
Jesus. Why?

38:20.566 --> 38:22.668
That's a good question.

38:22.734 --> 38:25.203
So nobody around your shop's
mentioned my case?

38:25.270 --> 38:27.639
- Oh, please.
- Not even the
Crypt Keeper, huh?

38:27.706 --> 38:28.974
Come on.

38:29.040 --> 38:30.241
The shit on my car

38:30.376 --> 38:31.977
smells like a fucking
fish farm, okay?

38:32.043 --> 38:34.522
I just want to know if
Cooperman had anything
to do with it. Did he?

38:34.546 --> 38:37.015
Of course he didn't.

38:37.082 --> 38:38.650
You've got to stop.

38:39.651 --> 38:41.420
But you also need to be careful.

38:41.487 --> 38:43.789
Come on, Billy.
Just listen to me.

38:43.855 --> 38:46.392
Donald Cooperman
would love nothing more

38:46.425 --> 38:48.259
- than to destroy you.
- Hmm.

38:48.394 --> 38:50.061
Don't give him
that chance, okay?

38:50.128 --> 38:52.631
Please? Please.

38:52.698 --> 38:55.701
Just so you know, I got a case,

38:55.767 --> 38:57.703
and I think it's
a pretty damn good one.

38:57.769 --> 39:02.273
Okay.

39:02.408 --> 39:03.575
Good night.

39:04.776 --> 39:06.612
You know, it's fucking
freezing out here.

39:06.678 --> 39:08.013
Go home.

39:17.255 --> 39:18.690
Sure you weren't drunk

39:18.757 --> 39:20.792
and, you know,
hit a dog or something?

39:20.859 --> 39:22.761
God damn it, Frankie,
I already told you

39:22.828 --> 39:24.262
I didn't run over anybody, okay?

39:24.329 --> 39:25.564
Don't be an asshole.

39:25.631 --> 39:27.499
Why would somebody dump
fish guts on your car?

39:27.566 --> 39:29.477
Fuck if I know. I guess
they thought it was funny.

39:29.501 --> 39:31.437
Do you think it's a threat?

39:32.771 --> 39:34.439
No, I think
it's a sign of respect.

39:34.440 --> 39:36.107
Of course it's a fucking threat.

39:36.174 --> 39:37.943
You're a fucker.

39:39.310 --> 39:41.780
Come on, honey. Quit
licking that shit, would you?

39:41.847 --> 39:42.648
Stop it.

39:42.714 --> 39:44.483
This says helicopter accident.

39:44.550 --> 39:46.217
I told you
it's just a go-by.

39:46.284 --> 39:47.686
Wherever it says "helicopter,"

39:47.753 --> 39:50.055
just replace it
with "seafaring craft"

39:50.121 --> 39:52.223
or "water vessel,"
whatever the fuck it is.

39:52.290 --> 39:53.459
Are you serious?

39:53.525 --> 39:55.126
They're both
wrongful death cases.

39:55.193 --> 39:57.104
Just change the names
of the parties...

39:57.128 --> 39:58.773
- Patty: Hello.
- ...from "chopper" to "boat,"

39:58.797 --> 40:00.341
and I'll fill out
the one-page form
attachment.

40:00.365 --> 40:01.733
- All right.
- Hey.

40:01.800 --> 40:03.502
- Oh, hey.
- Hey.

40:03.569 --> 40:07.038
Patty, uh, Solum-Beige
or something.

40:07.105 --> 40:09.541
It's Solis-Papagian. Hi.

40:09.608 --> 40:11.109
Uh, Brittany.

40:11.176 --> 40:12.210
His staff.

40:12.277 --> 40:14.546
Oh. Okay.

40:14.613 --> 40:16.247
God, this is a great place.

40:16.314 --> 40:17.949
No, I'm serious.
With this light.

40:18.016 --> 40:20.786
Man, if this was a condo,
I could sell it like that.

40:20.852 --> 40:22.320
I occasionally...
I sell real estate

40:22.387 --> 40:24.422
in the... in the Valley.

40:24.490 --> 40:26.658
So, uh, how are we doing
with the complaint?

40:26.725 --> 40:28.059
We can kind of use some help.

40:28.126 --> 40:30.361
So far we're suing
a helicopter company.

40:30.428 --> 40:31.497
Okay.

40:31.563 --> 40:33.632
Uh, would you like to take over?

40:33.699 --> 40:35.634
No, no, no, no, no.
I don't do briefs.

40:35.701 --> 40:37.068
It's just a complaint.

40:37.135 --> 40:38.303
I do not do those, either.

40:38.369 --> 40:39.571
So...

40:39.638 --> 40:42.541
Well, this is going to be great.

40:42.608 --> 40:44.409
You said she was going
to handle the motions.

40:44.476 --> 40:46.011
Who said that?

40:46.077 --> 40:47.345
You said that?

40:47.412 --> 40:49.481
Dude, I don't do civil cases.

40:49.548 --> 40:50.616
I told you that.

40:50.682 --> 40:52.050
I suck in court.

40:52.117 --> 40:54.653
Jesus Christ.
Glad I haven't
quit my day job.

40:54.720 --> 40:56.722
Okay, what do you do?

40:56.788 --> 40:59.257
Go ahead. Tell her.
I don't give a shit.

40:59.324 --> 41:01.159
Counseling.

41:01.226 --> 41:03.128
What? I can't... Look, why...

41:03.194 --> 41:05.964
why are we even bothering
with a complaint?

41:06.031 --> 41:09.300
We have two witnesses.
We have a demand letter.

41:09.367 --> 41:10.536
I mean, it's time to settle.

41:10.602 --> 41:12.137
- You know what?
- Let's go.

41:12.203 --> 41:14.539
This is not a real estate
deal. It's a court case.

41:14.540 --> 41:16.708
So either be a fucking
lawyer, or don't be one.

41:16.775 --> 41:18.409
You know, go out
to fucking Santa Clarita

41:18.544 --> 41:19.611
and sell doll houses.

41:19.678 --> 41:21.547
Ooh. Okay.

41:23.048 --> 41:24.149
Ahem.

41:26.217 --> 41:27.719
It was filed?

41:27.786 --> 41:31.657
Yes. 35 minutes ago.

41:31.723 --> 41:33.792
His writing hasn't
improved much.

41:38.263 --> 41:39.765
This is a fucking disaster.

41:39.831 --> 41:41.142
Do you know any other
word but fuck?

41:41.166 --> 41:44.570
Mark up the motion
to dismiss for tomorrow.

41:44.603 --> 41:47.372
- Tomorrow?
- Make an end run notice.

41:47.438 --> 41:48.583
Who's going to argue,
stutter girl?

41:48.607 --> 41:49.741
You know what? Shut up.

41:49.808 --> 41:51.342
Did you just tell me to shut up?

41:51.409 --> 41:52.578
Callie Senate.

41:52.644 --> 41:54.946
Callie? No.
I don't think so.

41:55.013 --> 41:57.348
She's more
business litigation
and stock fraud.

41:57.415 --> 41:58.584
This case lies in tort.

41:58.617 --> 42:00.285
I want Callie to argue this.

42:00.351 --> 42:03.789
Donald, come on, please.

42:03.855 --> 42:06.658
You know Callie is one
of my best friends.

42:06.725 --> 42:08.426
This would be very awkward.

42:08.493 --> 42:10.862
I'd like Callie to argue it.

42:10.929 --> 42:12.297
Please.

42:14.900 --> 42:17.703
She'd be a good match for Billy.

42:22.608 --> 42:23.642
Hey.

42:23.709 --> 42:25.977
- Hey.
- You got the big nod.

42:26.044 --> 42:27.245
Congrats.

42:27.312 --> 42:29.314
Thanks, I guess.
It's weird.

42:30.949 --> 42:32.984
I'm sure Donald instructed you

42:33.051 --> 42:34.753
to extract a pound of flesh.

42:34.820 --> 42:36.254
- Well.
- Of course.

42:36.321 --> 42:38.456
Just do me a favor
and don't humiliate Billy.

42:38.523 --> 42:39.858
You know? He is what he is.

42:39.925 --> 42:41.793
I am just going to try the case.

42:43.995 --> 42:46.865
Okay. Good.

42:55.006 --> 42:57.876
Patty: I don't give a shit.
They need it furnished.

42:57.943 --> 43:00.445
Yeah. That's what she said.

43:00.511 --> 43:01.780
- Uh-oh.
- Same to you.

43:01.847 --> 43:03.882
- What's wrong?
- Yes. Same to you.

43:03.949 --> 43:05.250
Asshole.

43:05.316 --> 43:06.651
Oh, nothing is wrong.

43:06.652 --> 43:09.054
Just got this.

43:09.120 --> 43:11.556
"Motion to dismiss tomorrow"?

43:11.657 --> 43:12.791
Yeah.
That's what it says.

43:12.858 --> 43:14.860
Don't they have to give notice?

43:14.926 --> 43:17.328
They filed it ex parte.
It's no big deal.

43:17.395 --> 43:18.864
They're just fucking with us.

43:18.930 --> 43:20.866
Okay, so now what?
We're going to settle

43:20.932 --> 43:23.068
on the courthouse
steps or something?

43:23.134 --> 43:25.704
Eventually we'll
have to argue it.

43:25.771 --> 43:28.740
Right. And by we,
we mean you, correct?

43:28.807 --> 43:32.210
Well, considering
the alternative, yeah, me.

43:34.212 --> 43:35.346
No offense.

43:39.317 --> 43:41.286
So, uh, you don't have
to be there tomorrow

43:41.352 --> 43:43.221
if you don't want to.
I mean, a civil case

43:43.288 --> 43:45.166
and you don't have to come
to every little hearing,

43:45.190 --> 43:47.358
but it would be nice because
it would show the judge

43:47.425 --> 43:48.994
you give a shit and all that.

43:49.060 --> 43:51.129
Yeah. No, I'll be there.
I'll definitely be there.

43:51.196 --> 43:52.196
Okay.

43:55.266 --> 43:56.501
That's Ryan.

43:56.567 --> 43:58.770
It's a baby picture.
Little baby Ryan.

44:00.071 --> 44:01.339
Yeah.

44:01.406 --> 44:03.108
His son looks just like him.

44:03.174 --> 44:04.175
Really?

44:05.811 --> 44:08.847
Oh, yeah.
I can see the...

44:08.914 --> 44:10.916
see the resemblance there.

44:13.084 --> 44:14.319
You all right?

44:14.385 --> 44:16.287
Want me to make it Irish?

44:16.354 --> 44:18.056
No. Better not, honey.

44:18.123 --> 44:19.825
- Uh, thanks, Frankie.
- You want anything?

44:19.891 --> 44:21.326
No, thank you.

44:24.362 --> 44:27.065
Is this, like, a lucky
ring or something?

44:27.132 --> 44:29.868
It's just my class ring,
college ring.

44:31.102 --> 44:32.714
Haven't I told you
when I went to Indiana?

44:32.738 --> 44:34.505
- I was a Hoosier.
- I don't think you did.

44:34.572 --> 44:36.174
My dad wanted me
to go to Alabama.

44:36.241 --> 44:38.276
He wanted me to play football
for Bear Bryant.

44:38.343 --> 44:40.545
I said, "How the hell
am I gonna play football?

44:40.611 --> 44:42.781
I weigh 136 pounds."

44:44.015 --> 44:45.316
I was a baseball player.

44:45.383 --> 44:47.194
My dad thought I was a pussy
for playing baseball.

44:47.218 --> 44:48.987
It was either football
or nothing for him.

44:49.054 --> 44:50.822
- Right.
- And, uh...

44:50.889 --> 44:52.123
And look at you now.

44:52.190 --> 44:54.259
I love it when you...

44:54.325 --> 44:56.761
Yeah. Big lawyer.

44:56.762 --> 44:58.463
Yeah. I'm...

44:58.529 --> 45:00.198
something else.

45:04.469 --> 45:05.904
♫ You ♫

45:05.971 --> 45:09.841
♫ You and me, baby ♫

45:30.028 --> 45:31.963
Welcome to Indiana basketball.

45:32.030 --> 45:33.832
Welcome to Indiana basketball.

45:51.516 --> 45:53.084
Okay, God damn it, I'm coming.

45:55.353 --> 45:56.822
What the hell
are you doing here?

45:56.888 --> 45:58.189
Were you asleep?

45:58.256 --> 46:01.359
I wish. I got court
tomorrow.

46:01.426 --> 46:02.828
I can't sleep for shit.

46:04.029 --> 46:06.264
I need a place to crash.

46:06.331 --> 46:07.999
Why?

46:08.066 --> 46:10.068
Mom and I got into a fight.

46:13.905 --> 46:15.140
If you don't let me stay here,

46:15.206 --> 46:16.842
I'm just going
to spend the night

46:16.875 --> 46:18.109
with a guy I'm seeing.

46:18.176 --> 46:20.278
You're something else.
Come on in.

46:23.381 --> 46:24.482
Why can't you sleep?

46:25.851 --> 46:27.118
You nervous about the case?

46:27.185 --> 46:28.920
No, I got hooked on Hoosiers.

46:28.987 --> 46:30.521
I've seen the fucking
thing 300 times.

46:30.588 --> 46:32.357
Every time, I'm nervous as hell

46:32.423 --> 46:33.959
they're going to lose.
I don't get it.

46:34.025 --> 46:35.393
I keep screaming at Hackman,

46:35.460 --> 46:37.695
"Please don't get thrown
out of any more games."

46:37.762 --> 46:39.030
Have a seat, honey.

46:39.097 --> 46:40.999
What's Hoosiers?

46:42.533 --> 46:43.869
Thanks.

46:45.770 --> 46:47.172
Here you go, baby.

46:54.279 --> 46:56.514
I'm not sleeping with the guy.

46:56.581 --> 46:57.949
Yeah, I know.

46:58.016 --> 46:59.484
How do you know?

46:59.550 --> 47:01.552
Okay, I don't know.
Does that make you
feel better?

47:01.619 --> 47:04.322
What do you want anyway?

47:05.423 --> 47:06.724
You suck.

47:06.791 --> 47:08.293
So you want me
to ask you questions

47:08.359 --> 47:10.528
about the guy
you're seeing?
Is that it?

47:10.595 --> 47:12.235
You know I'm not going
to like him anyway.

47:12.263 --> 47:13.898
Hi, baby. What's going on?

47:13.899 --> 47:15.766
She's my pal. Don't worry.

47:15.901 --> 47:18.103
She's not mean.
She's just hungry.

47:18.169 --> 47:19.804
There you go, sweetheart.
God damn.

47:19.905 --> 47:21.739
Took my fucking hand.

47:21.806 --> 47:24.509
See you. Go get going.
Get going, baby. Now shoo.

47:24.575 --> 47:25.911
Go, go. Good dog.

47:27.312 --> 47:29.614
Mom said you're in court
tomorrow against her firm.

47:29.680 --> 47:30.815
Yep. That's right.

47:30.916 --> 47:32.917
I guess I ought to call her.

47:32.918 --> 47:35.053
She's probably worried
sick about you.

47:37.488 --> 47:38.957
I miss you.

47:42.994 --> 47:44.162
I'm around.

47:47.532 --> 47:49.600
You ever coming back?

47:52.938 --> 47:54.940
I don't think so, honey.

48:02.981 --> 48:04.983
- Who are you calling?
- Uber.

48:05.050 --> 48:07.418
- I'm going home.
- I'll drive you.

48:07.485 --> 48:08.553
It's okay.

48:08.619 --> 48:10.121
Just put the phone away.

48:10.188 --> 48:11.489
I'm not letting you get in a car

48:11.556 --> 48:15.060
with a damn Uber guy,
some murderer.

48:15.126 --> 48:16.486
Your mother would
never forgive me.

48:17.662 --> 48:19.230
Well, you never know, okay?

48:21.599 --> 48:22.599
Come on.

48:31.409 --> 48:34.179
Did that dude just
take a picture of us?

48:36.047 --> 48:37.615
It's probably a paparazzi.

48:37.682 --> 48:39.050
Thinks we're somebody.

48:41.386 --> 48:43.388
This boyfriend of yours,
what does he look like?

48:43.454 --> 48:45.390
That's not him, Dad.

48:45.456 --> 48:48.426
Come on. Mom should be
rip shit by now.

48:59.770 --> 49:01.572
Listen, I got
a short window here,

49:01.639 --> 49:04.675
so I'm going to get
straight to the father-daughter
shit, okay?

49:04.742 --> 49:06.711
This guy
you're not sleeping with

49:06.777 --> 49:08.446
better be wearing a condom.

49:08.513 --> 49:10.014
Dad. Gross.

49:10.015 --> 49:11.482
Okay, never mind.

49:11.549 --> 49:13.551
It's just that there's
a lot of diseases out there,

49:13.618 --> 49:16.021
and then if you get pregnant,
you only got two choices.

49:16.087 --> 49:18.389
Both of them can
mess you up pretty good.

49:18.456 --> 49:20.025
I mean, it's not like, you know,

49:20.058 --> 49:21.792
adopting a puppy versus
having a root canal.

49:21.859 --> 49:24.295
- My God.
- And I'll skip
the substance abuse lecture,

49:24.362 --> 49:26.297
because you know firsthand
what that's all about.

49:26.364 --> 49:27.364
Thank God.

49:28.733 --> 49:31.136
Ah, shit.

49:31.202 --> 49:32.937
Dad, have you had anything
to drink tonight?

49:33.038 --> 49:34.839
- No. We're good.
- Do you promise?

49:34.905 --> 49:36.641
Yes, I said we're good,
all right?

49:37.908 --> 49:39.510
Haven't had a drop.

49:58.196 --> 49:59.264
How are we doing tonight?

49:59.330 --> 50:01.566
License and registration,
please.

50:01.632 --> 50:03.034
All rightie.

50:08.706 --> 50:10.375
There's the registration.

50:10.441 --> 50:11.709
There you go.

50:12.977 --> 50:14.412
Step out of the vehicle, sir.

50:14.479 --> 50:16.747
Can I ask you
why you pulled me over?

50:16.814 --> 50:18.416
We didn't get to that part yet.

50:18.483 --> 50:19.550
Now, sir.

50:20.518 --> 50:21.786
- Okay, but...
- Thank you.

50:21.852 --> 50:23.088
Just for the record,

50:23.154 --> 50:24.822
I asked you why you
pulled me over,

50:24.889 --> 50:26.191
and you couldn't tell me.

50:26.257 --> 50:27.758
Stay in the vehicle, ma'am.

50:30.528 --> 50:32.063
Sir, have you been
drinking tonight?

50:32.130 --> 50:34.265
No, sir, I have not.

50:34.332 --> 50:36.167
I'm not sure if I
mentioned this to you,

50:36.234 --> 50:37.602
but I'm an attorney.

50:37.668 --> 50:39.570
so I have a pretty good
knowledge of the law,

50:39.637 --> 50:41.639
and unless you tell me
why you're fucking with me,

50:41.706 --> 50:43.874
this could constitute
an illegal stop.

50:43.941 --> 50:47.778
At this time, I'd like
to ask you to participate
in a sobriety test.

50:47.845 --> 50:49.280
Okay, I'll take your damn test,

50:49.347 --> 50:51.092
but as I told you before,
I'm as sober as Bill Dudley.

50:51.116 --> 50:52.893
You need to tell me why
you fucking stopped me

50:52.917 --> 50:55.420
because I wasn't doing shit
but driving between the lines.

50:55.486 --> 50:58.122
Sir, turn around and put
your hands behind your back.

50:58.123 --> 50:59.557
Come on. That's
my daughter there.

50:59.624 --> 51:01.426
Do we have to do this?
Seriously?

51:01.492 --> 51:03.128
Did a little bird
whisper in your ear?

51:03.161 --> 51:04.829
- Who told you to stop me?
- Turn around.

51:04.895 --> 51:05.996
Smells like shit.

51:06.131 --> 51:07.932
I saw your fucking
mouth breather

51:07.998 --> 51:09.234
scoping me out back there.

51:09.300 --> 51:10.735
- You can be a...
- Dad!

51:10.801 --> 51:11.801
Fuck!

51:13.138 --> 51:15.373
Fucker!

54:31.969 --> 54:33.404
You stinker!
