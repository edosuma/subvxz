<i>Previously on
"Devious Maids"...</i>

00:01.557 --> 00:04.091
- Professor Suarez?
- Professor?

00:05.688 --> 00:07.509
You lied to our faces.

00:07.586 --> 00:10.104
I am telling everyone
who you really are!

00:10.139 --> 00:12.473
Then I guess I'm going to have
to tell Peri Westmore

00:12.525 --> 00:14.142
that you're sleeping
with her husband.

00:14.193 --> 00:15.693
I didn't know
you and Mr. Powell had a son.

00:15.728 --> 00:18.530
We don't anymore.
He was killed.

00:18.564 --> 00:20.231
You want to help me?

00:20.265 --> 00:22.700
- Dust.
- Why are you being so mean?

00:22.735 --> 00:25.453
I am doing my job,
and I need you to do yours.

00:25.487 --> 00:28.623
- I am so sorry.
- You don't have to apologize.

00:28.657 --> 00:31.543
But it's good I know the truth
because now I can help you.

00:31.577 --> 00:35.246
Hello. I heard you were
looking for a new maid?

00:35.280 --> 00:37.715
Olivia Rice...
the first Mrs. Stappord,

00:37.750 --> 00:38.805
and a world-class psycho.

00:38.846 --> 00:40.259
Let me talk to Olivia.

00:40.330 --> 00:42.508
I think Michael is still
in love with you.

00:42.626 --> 00:43.814
Really?

00:43.849 --> 00:45.840
- Oh, my God.
- What's happening?

00:45.891 --> 00:47.759
Your business manager
has disappeared

00:47.793 --> 00:49.394
and taken all of your money
with him.

00:49.428 --> 00:51.596
You now don't have
a cent to your name.

00:51.630 --> 00:54.265
The question is
how can I make some money?

00:54.299 --> 00:56.601
- What are you gonna do?
- What I've always done.

00:56.635 --> 00:59.487
It's time to find
husband number seven.

The car's pulling up.

01:10.649 --> 01:12.094
<i>¿Tan pronto?</i>

01:12.166 --> 01:13.188
Help me.

01:13.223 --> 01:14.335
Aren't you excited?

01:14.370 --> 01:16.871
We've never met
a billionaire before.

01:16.922 --> 01:19.290
I'm thrilled.
Put these over there.

01:19.324 --> 01:22.794
So... Mrs. Delatour
is really dating this guy?

01:22.828 --> 01:24.796
That's what she said
on the phone.

01:24.830 --> 01:28.600
It was only a 2-week cruise.
She moves fast.

01:28.634 --> 01:30.167
The guy's 76 years old.

01:30.185 --> 01:32.103
She doesn't have time
to play hard to get.

01:32.137 --> 01:35.506
So... we're not going
to say anything about Remi?

01:35.541 --> 01:37.775
No. Not a word.

01:40.145 --> 01:42.313
Welcome home, Mrs. Delatour.
How was the cruise?

01:42.347 --> 01:44.148
We can do small talk
later, dear.

01:44.182 --> 01:46.284
I need to ask you both a favor

01:46.318 --> 01:49.153
before you meet my new beau.

01:49.187 --> 01:50.655
What kind of favor?

01:50.689 --> 01:53.708
First, you should know
I adore Alfred.

01:53.742 --> 01:56.527
He has everything
I look for in a man...

01:56.545 --> 01:58.696
charm, wit, sophistication.

01:58.714 --> 02:00.248
And a billion dollars.

02:00.299 --> 02:02.250
You forgot to mention
a billion dollars.

02:02.301 --> 02:03.384
Don't be crass.

02:03.419 --> 02:06.170
Despite my affection
for Alfred,

02:06.204 --> 02:08.673
I haven't been
completely honest with him.

02:08.707 --> 02:10.708
So you two need to promise

02:10.726 --> 02:12.593
not to expose
my little white lie.

02:12.645 --> 02:15.212
What did you tell him?

02:15.230 --> 02:17.715
I told him I was 39.

02:21.219 --> 02:22.353
Pounds?

02:22.387 --> 02:24.322
Years old.

02:24.356 --> 02:26.240
That's not a little white lie.

02:26.275 --> 02:28.693
That's an alternate universe.

02:28.727 --> 02:30.394
It's not that far-fetched.

02:30.412 --> 02:33.397
I think this face
speaks for itself.

02:33.415 --> 02:36.584
Yeah, and it's saying,
"Stop pulling me so tight."

02:36.618 --> 02:38.086
Genevieve?!

02:38.120 --> 02:40.705
We don't have time
for your vicious attacks.

02:40.739 --> 02:43.708
I need you both to promise
you won't say anything.

02:43.742 --> 02:45.093
Okay, we promise.

02:45.127 --> 02:47.261
But just how stupid
is this guy?

02:47.296 --> 02:48.596
Alfred is not stupid.

02:48.630 --> 02:50.798
He must be!
How else would someone believe

02:50.849 --> 02:52.850
that you are 39 years old?

02:56.772 --> 02:59.757
Where's my pretty young thing?

02:59.775 --> 03:02.610
I'm right here, sugar.

03:02.644 --> 03:06.314
- Mm.
- Zoila, Valentina...

03:06.365 --> 03:10.118
I want you to meet
Alfred Pettigrove...

03:10.152 --> 03:12.153
- the man I'm going to marry.
- Hmm.

03:18.877 --> 03:24.716
1.08 - Minding the Baby

03:30.389 --> 03:33.925
So the Powell's secret room
is at the end of the hallway.

03:33.959 --> 03:35.426
And there's a button
in the niche.

03:35.460 --> 03:38.513
You press the button,
and the door swings inward.

03:38.564 --> 03:40.765
- And this is where the DVDs are?
- Yes.

03:40.799 --> 03:43.101
Go through all of the ones
marked "Flora."

03:43.135 --> 03:46.187
And she was using this DVD
for blackmail?

03:46.238 --> 03:48.823
That's why she was killed.

03:48.857 --> 03:50.775
Ay.

03:50.809 --> 03:52.243
Chicas!

03:52.277 --> 03:54.579
Oh, hey!
What are you two doing here?

03:54.613 --> 03:56.531
Zoila called.
She had time for a quick bite.

03:56.582 --> 03:57.865
You want to join us?

03:57.916 --> 04:00.535
I'd love to, but I don't want
to be late for work.

04:00.586 --> 04:03.755
You told me Spence
was still in the hospital.

04:03.789 --> 04:05.490
Yeah, and you told me

04:05.524 --> 04:07.491
Peri was shooting
a movie in New York.

04:07.509 --> 04:10.378
Who exactly
are you working for?

04:10.429 --> 04:13.798
I'm so swamped with work
at the Stappord house

04:13.832 --> 04:16.434
that Rosie agreed
to help me out.

04:16.468 --> 04:17.500
Isn't that nice?

04:19.688 --> 04:22.306
I am so thoughtful.

04:22.340 --> 04:25.943
Well, then, I guess we'll
see you later.

04:25.978 --> 04:27.695
- Bye.
- Bye. Have a good lunch.

04:29.865 --> 04:31.564
I'm so sorry.
I didn't know what to say.

04:31.602 --> 04:32.909
It's okay.

04:32.951 --> 04:36.954
But you... you made up that stuff
about the Stappords so quickly.

04:36.989 --> 04:38.456
You're a good liar.

04:38.490 --> 04:40.691
Yeah, well...

04:40.709 --> 04:43.328
I didn't used to be.

04:49.001 --> 04:51.535
Hello?

04:53.839 --> 04:54.755
Ow!

04:54.807 --> 04:56.340
Oh, my God!

04:56.375 --> 04:59.510
Marisol! We thought
you were at the store.

04:59.545 --> 05:01.512
- I-I left my wallet.
- Son of a bitch!

05:01.547 --> 05:02.647
Are you okay?

05:02.681 --> 05:04.549
- I landed on her shoe.
- Oh.

05:04.583 --> 05:06.884
We didn't think you'd be back
for a while.

05:06.902 --> 05:08.853
Yeah. Yeah, I can see that.

05:08.887 --> 05:11.388
- Just... grab my...
- Maybe come back in an hour.

05:11.406 --> 05:13.741
- You can make us dinner.
- Sure.

05:13.775 --> 05:16.360
Just gonna wipe off the counter first,
if that's okay.

05:16.394 --> 05:17.278
Marisol!

05:18.730 --> 05:20.698
We're so sorry.

05:20.732 --> 05:22.250
No worries.
And from now on

05:22.284 --> 05:23.784
if I'm at the store
and I forgot my wallet,

05:23.836 --> 05:27.738
I'll just... shoplift.

05:30.926 --> 05:33.461
Mrs. Evelyn!

05:33.512 --> 05:35.680
I'm in here, Rosie.

05:35.714 --> 05:38.082
Where is "here"?

05:38.100 --> 05:42.553
Go to the door
next to the Picasso.

05:42.587 --> 05:45.273
And if you're not
familiar with Analytic Cubism...

05:45.307 --> 05:48.526
follow the sound of my voice.

05:50.979 --> 05:52.980
Hello there.

05:53.031 --> 05:56.033
What in God's name is that?

05:56.068 --> 05:57.869
This is Tucker.

05:57.903 --> 06:00.738
Say hello to Mrs. Evelyn.

06:02.157 --> 06:04.108
I thought your son
was still in Mexico.

06:04.126 --> 06:06.610
Oh, no.
This is the Westmores' son.

06:06.628 --> 06:08.412
I was gonna say
he's awfully white.

06:08.447 --> 06:10.781
Well, since she's working
and he's in the hospital,

06:10.816 --> 06:11.966
I have to watch him.

06:12.000 --> 06:14.451
Honestly...

06:14.469 --> 06:16.087
Rosie, don't you think
you should have mentioned this

06:16.121 --> 06:17.555
in the interview?

06:17.589 --> 06:21.726
Why would you worry about
such a sweet boy?

06:25.814 --> 06:29.100
This rug is worth
over $100,000.

06:29.134 --> 06:31.152
If you ruin it,
I will personally see to it

06:31.186 --> 06:34.772
that you end up
in the public school system.

06:40.979 --> 06:43.114
Listen up, people.

06:43.148 --> 06:45.816
What is wrong
with this picture?

06:48.120 --> 06:50.154
I'm talking about my sweater.

06:50.172 --> 06:52.540
Do I really wear clothes
this tight?

06:52.591 --> 06:56.093
Well, yeah.
But it's usually your pants.

06:56.128 --> 06:58.796
Someone put this in the dryer.

06:58.830 --> 07:02.433
I want to know
who's in charge of laundry.

07:02.467 --> 07:05.686
Well, let me think.

07:05.721 --> 07:09.774
This should have gone
to the cleaners. Hmm?

07:09.808 --> 07:11.392
Not in the washing machine.

07:14.012 --> 07:15.512
You see, here's the thing.

07:15.530 --> 07:17.615
I don't think
I put it in there.

07:17.649 --> 07:20.067
Well, you must have, because...

07:20.118 --> 07:22.453
I can see my belly button.

07:28.193 --> 07:29.794
I'm sure it won't happen again.

07:29.828 --> 07:31.528
It better not.

07:31.546 --> 07:33.581
Do you want me
to throw it away?

07:33.632 --> 07:35.383
Nah.

07:35.417 --> 07:38.252
With the right leather pants,
this could work.

07:45.978 --> 07:47.979
What are you staring at?

07:48.013 --> 07:50.815
We both know I didn't
put the sweater in the dryer.

07:50.849 --> 07:52.316
- Do we?
- Yes.

07:52.351 --> 07:54.485
And if you don't tell
Alejandro the truth,

07:54.519 --> 07:57.054
I'm gonna go Puerto Rican
on your ass.

07:57.072 --> 07:58.606
Since when do you threaten me?

07:58.657 --> 08:00.391
Oh, my God. Odessa...

08:00.409 --> 08:03.110
- Have you been drinking?
- Don't be stupid.

08:03.161 --> 08:06.414
Well, I used to be a bartender.
I know scotch when I smell it.

08:06.448 --> 08:08.232
Well, if you want to be
a bartender again,

08:08.250 --> 08:10.117
keep making accusations.

08:17.342 --> 08:19.710
What have we here?

08:19.744 --> 08:23.014
- Smells delicious.
- Mami made lamb chops.

08:23.048 --> 08:25.716
And do I smell asparagus?

08:25.750 --> 08:28.519
That's amazing.

08:28.553 --> 08:30.688
When you're blind,
the other four senses

08:30.722 --> 08:32.556
become more heightened.

08:32.590 --> 08:34.140
After all these years,

08:34.192 --> 08:37.193
I've learned to see with my hands.

08:37.229 --> 08:40.698
That's how I could tell
how beautiful Genevieve was.

08:40.732 --> 08:45.036
She let me caress
her smooth, perfect face.

08:45.070 --> 08:47.154
Did she let you feel her neck?

08:49.157 --> 08:51.792
Is... is there a draft in here?

08:53.712 --> 08:57.081
I'm sure that Zoila
left the window open.

08:57.115 --> 08:59.884
You should go shut it...
tight.

08:59.918 --> 09:02.670
It's lovely to finally
meet you, Zoila.

09:02.721 --> 09:05.473
Genevieve says that you're
the most brilliant housekeeper

09:05.507 --> 09:07.808
- in all of Beverly hills.
- Oh.

09:07.843 --> 09:11.645
Well, you shouldn't believe
everything she says.

09:13.598 --> 09:17.151
Alfred? We should start
planning our wedding.

09:17.185 --> 09:20.104
Oh, I leave all that
in your capable hands, my dear.

09:20.138 --> 09:23.107
'Cause I don't know the first
thing about weddings.

09:23.141 --> 09:25.609
Haven't you been
married before?

09:25.643 --> 09:27.311
Oh, no. Sadly, I haven't.

09:27.329 --> 09:30.647
Oh, a handsome man like you?
Come on.

09:30.665 --> 09:33.250
When I was younger, I was
obsessed with making money.

09:33.285 --> 09:36.754
But somewhere along the way,
I forgot to acquire

09:36.788 --> 09:39.707
the only important treasure
there is.

09:39.758 --> 09:42.927
- What's that?
- A family.

09:42.961 --> 09:46.680
You know,
our food is getting cold.

09:46.715 --> 09:48.883
To me, it's an absolute miracle.

09:48.934 --> 09:52.603
Not only has this darling girl agreed
to be my bride...

09:52.637 --> 09:54.271
she's also agreed

09:54.306 --> 09:58.409
to give birth to my child.

10:00.278 --> 10:04.081
Yeah, that's a miracle,
all right.

10:55.485 --> 10:57.987
Ay, Flora.

10:58.005 --> 11:00.322
<i>Santos cielos.</i>

11:03.961 --> 11:07.496
You told Alfred
you could have his baby.

11:07.514 --> 11:09.882
What could you be thinking?

11:09.933 --> 11:12.935
A few weeks after the wedding,
after we're legally joined,

11:12.970 --> 11:14.887
I will go for
my annual checkup.

11:14.938 --> 11:17.306
Then I will come home,
and I will inform Alfred

11:17.340 --> 11:20.276
that I am, sadly,
unable to conceive.

11:20.310 --> 11:22.228
He will then know the truth.

11:22.279 --> 11:25.231
Except for my age,
which is none of his business.

11:25.282 --> 11:28.484
But you're still depriving him
of the one thing he wants most.

11:28.518 --> 11:30.352
You mean a baby?

11:30.371 --> 11:32.572
No.
I've got that all figured out.

11:32.623 --> 11:34.123
We'll adopt.

11:34.158 --> 11:35.658
Adopt?

11:35.692 --> 11:37.994
Yes.
That way, everybody wins.

11:38.028 --> 11:41.030
Alfred gets a family.
I get to stay rich.

11:41.048 --> 11:44.467
And some spindly little orphan
gets a fabulous life.

11:44.501 --> 11:47.870
So now you're bringing a kid
into this web of lies?

11:48.004 --> 11:49.638
Oh, but he'll be loved.

11:49.673 --> 11:53.259
Alfred will be a doting father.

11:53.310 --> 11:56.211
And you know what
a great mother I was.

11:56.229 --> 12:00.382
Speaking of...

12:00.400 --> 12:01.901
Where's your son?

12:01.935 --> 12:04.653
Remi? I don't know.

12:04.688 --> 12:06.739
I just assumed...

12:06.773 --> 12:08.390
Where is he?

12:08.408 --> 12:10.659
Let me be the first
to tell you.

12:10.694 --> 12:11.944
Remi is in Aspen.

12:11.995 --> 12:14.730
- He went skiing with some friends.
- Oh.

12:14.748 --> 12:17.866
Well, I'm so glad
he's having fun.

12:17.900 --> 12:21.203
I know how
stressful school is.

12:21.237 --> 12:23.839
Mrs. Delatour,
Mr. Pettigrove needs you.

12:23.873 --> 12:26.241
Oh. Excuse me.

12:29.179 --> 12:30.846
What were you thinking?

12:30.880 --> 12:32.798
There's too much lying
in this house.

12:32.849 --> 12:34.683
Remi can tell her the truth
when he's back.

12:34.718 --> 12:36.468
So who's gonna tell Alfred
the truth?

12:36.519 --> 12:38.587
He's blind, not stupid.

12:38.605 --> 12:41.473
He'll figure all this out
when he wants to.

12:52.602 --> 12:53.602
Rosie?

12:56.105 --> 12:58.940
Rosie! The baby is crying.

13:12.138 --> 13:13.922
Why are you all alone?

13:13.956 --> 13:15.724
Where is Rosie?

13:17.260 --> 13:20.646
Can you be more specific?

13:23.633 --> 13:24.966
Please stop.

13:24.985 --> 13:28.604
I just took a valium,
and you are ruining it.

13:31.741 --> 13:33.475
I'm not going to hold you.

13:33.493 --> 13:35.778
I'm wearing silk,
and you are moist.

13:57.300 --> 14:00.836
- Mrs. Evelyn?
- Shh. He's almost asleep.

14:09.229 --> 14:10.562
- Hey.
- Hey.

14:10.613 --> 14:12.898
Again, I am so sorry.

14:12.949 --> 14:15.234
Taylor, you do not have
to keep apologizing.

14:15.285 --> 14:16.902
This is your house.

14:16.953 --> 14:19.288
I don't want you think
we're weird for...

14:19.322 --> 14:20.856
doing it in the kitchen.

14:20.874 --> 14:22.207
Now why would I think
that's weird?

14:24.961 --> 14:26.695
It's just,
I've been trying to make

14:26.713 --> 14:30.049
our sex life more exciting
for Michael.

14:30.083 --> 14:32.751
Ooh. Lucky husband.

14:32.802 --> 14:34.586
Well, actually,
we're trying to get pregnant.

14:34.637 --> 14:37.387
You are?
That's terrific!

14:37.533 --> 14:38.763
Thanks.

14:38.816 --> 14:40.859
Oh, you guys are gonna make
great parents.

14:40.994 --> 14:43.178
- I hope so.
- Yeah.

14:43.212 --> 14:46.682
It's just, we've been
trying for months now,

14:46.716 --> 14:49.768
and it's not working.

14:51.321 --> 14:52.938
Oh, honey.

14:52.989 --> 14:56.742
The thing Michael wants most
in the whole world is a baby.

14:56.776 --> 14:59.278
And what if I can't
give that to him?

14:59.329 --> 15:01.864
No, no, no, no.
Don't go there.

15:01.898 --> 15:03.866
Remember, these things
take time.

15:03.900 --> 15:06.418
But what if there's
something wrong with me?

15:06.453 --> 15:08.287
Olivia wasn't able
to give him a baby,

15:08.338 --> 15:09.872
and he left her.

15:09.906 --> 15:12.624
He left Olivia because
she's a loon and a half.

15:12.675 --> 15:14.510
Maybe she became a loon

15:14.544 --> 15:18.079
because she could feel him
becoming unhappy.

15:20.049 --> 15:22.351
There's a fertility clinic
in Santa Monica,

15:22.385 --> 15:24.937
and they are considered
the best in the state.

15:24.971 --> 15:27.422
Maybe you could go there,
get checked out.

15:29.359 --> 15:32.027
- That's probably a good idea.
- Mm-hmm.

15:32.061 --> 15:34.897
And remember,
Michael really loves you.

15:34.931 --> 15:38.117
I can't imagine he would ever
even think about leaving you.

15:38.151 --> 15:41.870
Yeah. Well...

15:41.905 --> 15:44.373
I'll feel more secure
once I know I'm pregnant.

16:06.229 --> 16:07.846
Odessa!

16:07.897 --> 16:10.649
It's 3:00 in the morning.
What are you doing?

16:10.683 --> 16:12.684
I'm fine.
Go back to bed.

16:12.735 --> 16:15.354
Oh, my... were you drinking
Alejandro's scotch?

16:15.405 --> 16:17.022
This is none of your business.

16:17.073 --> 16:18.357
Well, if you let
Alejandro think I did this,

16:18.408 --> 16:20.242
then it will be my business.

16:22.478 --> 16:24.246
Odessa, your hand is bleeding.

16:24.280 --> 16:27.533
Oh! Look at that.

16:27.584 --> 16:29.418
Where do you keep
the first aid kit?

16:29.452 --> 16:31.036
In my medicine cabinet.

16:31.087 --> 16:33.154
I'm gonna go get you
a band-aid.

16:33.173 --> 16:35.824
No! I don't want you
in my room.

16:35.842 --> 16:37.342
Why?

16:37.377 --> 16:39.845
You think I'm gonna steal
your nesting dolls or something?

16:41.097 --> 16:43.048
Just sit there and try not
to break anything else.

16:43.099 --> 16:46.167
<i>Carajo. Ay.</i>

17:24.807 --> 17:26.842
What took you so long?

17:26.876 --> 17:30.145
Let me see your hand.

17:30.179 --> 17:32.064
Okay.

17:32.098 --> 17:34.716
Ow! That hurts.

17:34.734 --> 17:37.719
I know. You don't want it
to get infected.

17:37.737 --> 17:40.489
What the hell
is going on in here?

17:40.523 --> 17:41.990
Sorry to wake you.

17:42.025 --> 17:44.076
We just had a little accident,
that's all.

17:44.110 --> 17:47.395
Would someone like to explain
why my good scotch

17:47.413 --> 17:48.914
is lying all over the floor?

17:51.200 --> 17:52.084
I knocked it over.

17:53.503 --> 17:57.589
And Odessa cut her hand
helping me clean it up.

17:59.175 --> 18:00.241
You okay, Odessa?

18:00.260 --> 18:02.911
I'm fine. Thank you.

18:02.929 --> 18:04.296
Why don't you two
just go back to bed?

18:04.347 --> 18:05.914
I'll take care of this.

18:05.932 --> 18:08.850
That's a good idea.
I got rehearsal in the morning.

18:08.885 --> 18:10.052
Come on, Odessa.

18:12.990 --> 18:15.012
And you, be more careful.

18:15.047 --> 18:17.419
You're starting to piss me off.

18:17.454 --> 18:19.111
Yes, sir.

18:35.398 --> 18:38.050
<i>Mi amor...</i>

18:40.270 --> 18:42.888
Shh.

18:51.998 --> 18:55.567
Come on, Marisol.
Give me a break.

18:55.585 --> 18:59.738
Rosie? I heard the baby fussing.
Is he okay?

18:59.756 --> 19:01.406
- He's cutting a tooth.
- Oh...

19:01.424 --> 19:03.676
Poor little thing.

19:03.710 --> 19:05.594
Why don't I take him
for a quick walk?

19:05.629 --> 19:07.379
Sometimes the bouncing
of the stroller

19:07.413 --> 19:10.015
helps him fall asleep,
and then I'll get back to work.

19:10.050 --> 19:12.935
Why not let me?

19:12.969 --> 19:14.019
Let you what?

19:14.054 --> 19:15.888
Let me take him.

19:17.274 --> 19:18.891
For heaven's sake.

19:18.925 --> 19:21.977
I am perfectly capable
of pushing a stroller.

19:22.028 --> 19:24.396
I'm just not sure
Mrs. Peri would be comfortable

19:24.430 --> 19:26.699
with you looking after
her baby.

19:26.733 --> 19:29.101
The woman appears topless
in every film she does.

19:29.119 --> 19:32.121
I'm not sure she's
in a position to judge me.

19:32.155 --> 19:33.939
I don't know.

19:33.957 --> 19:35.291
Come on, Rosie.

19:35.325 --> 19:37.376
This way, you can have
the house all to yourself.

19:37.410 --> 19:39.962
Won't that make it easier
to get your work done?

19:44.167 --> 19:45.617
Actually, it would.

19:45.635 --> 19:47.887
But have him back
in 30 minutes.

19:47.921 --> 19:49.972
- Okay?
- Of course.

19:50.006 --> 19:52.975
Come on, you darling thing.

19:53.009 --> 19:56.478
We are going to have
so much fun.

20:09.860 --> 20:13.162
What are you doing?

20:13.196 --> 20:15.831
Huh? I'm just polishing
the silver.

20:15.866 --> 20:18.417
But that is my job.

20:18.451 --> 20:22.788
Yes. But I'm so good at it.
The trick is to rub it

20:22.822 --> 20:24.656
until you can see
your reflection. You see?

20:24.674 --> 20:27.927
Yeah.
There's my pretty face. Hmm.

20:27.961 --> 20:31.830
I will ask you again.
Why are you doing my job?

20:31.848 --> 20:34.833
Well, you were resting.
I didn't want to disturb you.

20:37.187 --> 20:38.354
You know, don't you?

20:42.442 --> 20:46.011
I saw the Cytoxan
in your medicine cabinet. Yes.

20:46.029 --> 20:48.147
That's what the doctors
gave my mother.

20:48.181 --> 20:50.366
She had cancer?

20:50.400 --> 20:52.067
In her pancreas.

20:52.118 --> 20:53.986
You?

20:54.020 --> 20:56.188
Bone.

20:56.206 --> 20:58.490
That's why you've been
drinking?

20:58.524 --> 21:00.025
Because of the pain?

21:03.413 --> 21:05.381
- Have you told Alejandro?
- No.

21:05.415 --> 21:08.751
- Nobody knows.
- Ay, bendito, Odessa.

21:08.802 --> 21:10.469
You shouldn't be
going through this alone.

21:10.503 --> 21:11.921
What do you care?

21:11.972 --> 21:13.255
I'm worried about you.

21:13.306 --> 21:15.140
You know, we're friends.

21:15.175 --> 21:16.308
No, we're not.

21:16.343 --> 21:17.927
Why are you getting angry?

21:17.978 --> 21:20.879
- You know nothing about me.
- Then tell me something.

21:20.897 --> 21:23.098
We have worked together
for months.

21:23.149 --> 21:24.433
I'd like to know you.

21:24.484 --> 21:27.903
Why? Because you think
I'm going to die?

21:27.938 --> 21:29.855
- Odessa...
- I polish the silver.

21:29.889 --> 21:31.490
It is my job!

21:31.524 --> 21:34.026
You will not take that away from me.

21:36.196 --> 21:39.081
I'm not dead yet.

21:53.129 --> 21:54.913
So where did you
hear about this place?

21:54.931 --> 21:56.298
A friend recommended it.

21:56.349 --> 21:58.250
Even though it didn't
work for me,

21:58.268 --> 21:59.635
I love the doctors.

21:59.686 --> 22:02.021
They seem to really
know their stuff.

22:02.055 --> 22:03.105
Oh, I didn't know.

22:03.139 --> 22:05.891
- It's okay.
- We just adopted.

22:05.925 --> 22:08.777
But when we interviewed you,

22:08.812 --> 22:10.896
you said you didn't
have any family.

22:10.930 --> 22:15.267
Yes.
Well, I got a divorce.

22:15.285 --> 22:17.403
But what about the child?

22:17.437 --> 22:21.123
I-I...

22:21.157 --> 22:23.909
had to give him back.

22:23.943 --> 22:24.960
What?!

22:24.995 --> 22:26.778
Um, there were problems.

22:26.796 --> 22:29.781
God.
That must have been awful.

22:29.799 --> 22:32.001
Can we not talk about this?

22:32.052 --> 22:33.952
Of course. I am so sorry.

22:33.970 --> 22:37.119
Um, here.
Let me get you a tissue.

22:37.145 --> 22:38.305
Okay.

22:43.480 --> 22:45.064
Taylor?

22:45.098 --> 22:47.316
Joan!

22:47.350 --> 22:48.901
Hi.

22:48.935 --> 22:51.020
I haven't seen you since, uh...

22:51.071 --> 22:52.471
The Stein Bat Mitzvah.

22:52.489 --> 22:53.939
- Ah.
- Such an unfortunate looking girl.

22:53.973 --> 22:55.190
But what a pretty venue.

22:56.826 --> 22:58.694
So, uh, what brings you here?

22:58.745 --> 23:00.996
Are you and Michael
trying to have a baby?

23:01.031 --> 23:02.314
That depends.

23:02.332 --> 23:04.149
Are you still good friends
with Olivia?

23:04.167 --> 23:07.119
Ugh, that cow.
We had a falling out.

23:07.153 --> 23:09.321
Then yes, we're trying
to have a baby.

23:09.339 --> 23:13.008
But for obvious reasons,
I want to keep it quiet.

23:13.043 --> 23:15.961
Oh, I completely understand.

23:15.995 --> 23:19.965
Well, good luck on that.

23:19.999 --> 23:21.600
Take care, Joan.

23:25.055 --> 23:27.689
Olivia, darling. It's Joan.

23:27.724 --> 23:30.692
I know, it's been ages.

23:30.727 --> 23:36.281
You'll never guess
who I just ran into.

23:42.655 --> 23:43.906
Hello?

23:43.957 --> 23:45.357
Did you watch all the DVDs?

23:45.375 --> 23:46.825
I'm on the last one.

23:46.859 --> 23:49.411
Oh, Marisol.
The things I've seen today.

23:49.462 --> 23:52.581
I'm gonna have to go
to confession twice this week.

23:52.632 --> 23:54.716
Did you see anything
that looked like an assault?

23:54.751 --> 23:56.001
No.

23:56.035 --> 23:57.369
I watched nine DVDs,

23:57.387 --> 23:59.421
and Flora seemed to be
having fun in all of them.

23:59.472 --> 24:01.006
It's got to be there.

24:01.040 --> 24:02.925
Start over.
Watch them again.

24:02.976 --> 24:06.011
I can't start over.
I've been in here since...

24:06.045 --> 24:08.380
- Oh, my God.
- What is it?

24:08.398 --> 24:10.382
Mrs. Evelyn isn't back yet.

24:10.400 --> 24:12.184
- So?
- She took the baby.

24:12.218 --> 24:14.386
I have to call you back.

24:17.824 --> 24:21.560
Zoila, did Genevieve
happen to mention

24:21.578 --> 24:23.996
- I collect antiques?
- No.

24:24.030 --> 24:26.331
They're my passion.

24:26.366 --> 24:30.502
And I'm... I'm dying to know
if this is a Chippendale.

24:30.537 --> 24:32.538
It is.

24:32.572 --> 24:35.624
You can tell just from
touching it? That's impressive.

24:35.675 --> 24:37.292
Well, like I said,

24:37.343 --> 24:40.879
being blind doesn't mean
not having keen perception.

24:40.913 --> 24:43.432
For instance, I can tell
you don't like me.

24:43.466 --> 24:45.417
That's not true.

24:45.435 --> 24:47.252
I hear the disapproval
in your voice

24:47.270 --> 24:48.687
when I'm with Genevieve.

24:48.721 --> 24:51.023
You think I'm too old for her.

24:51.057 --> 24:53.258
No. That's not it.

24:53.276 --> 24:54.726
Oh, Zoila.

24:54.760 --> 24:57.729
What matters is that
we connect.

24:57.763 --> 25:01.200
I feel that I really
understand Genevieve.

25:01.234 --> 25:04.319
I can tell how fragile she is.

25:04.370 --> 25:07.456
I sometimes wonder if she had
an unstable childhood.

25:07.490 --> 25:10.209
Her mother went through
a lot of husbands.

25:10.243 --> 25:12.377
- That does leave a mark.
- Oh.

25:12.412 --> 25:15.998
But what was her relationship
with her father like?

25:16.049 --> 25:18.116
She never knew him.

25:18.134 --> 25:20.219
He died during the Korean War
before she was born.

25:20.253 --> 25:22.171
Korean War?

25:22.222 --> 25:24.723
Uh...

25:24.757 --> 25:26.091
You know...

25:26.125 --> 25:28.460
I really should get
that dishwasher started.

25:28.478 --> 25:30.512
Zoila, stop!

25:30.563 --> 25:33.265
Just how old is Genevieve?

25:33.299 --> 25:35.517
Uh...

25:35.568 --> 25:37.269
Why?

25:37.303 --> 25:40.606
If she was born during the '50s,
she can't be 39.

25:40.640 --> 25:43.174
Um, I'm thinking
of a different Korean War...

25:43.193 --> 25:45.611
A later one. Those people
are always arguing, right?

25:45.645 --> 25:47.362
Zoila, if you do like me,

25:47.397 --> 25:50.532
have the decency
to tell me the truth.

25:53.653 --> 25:55.370
Okay, I'll tell you.

25:55.405 --> 25:59.908
But just remember how much
you like antiques.

26:06.751 --> 26:09.887
Get out of my way, Genevieve.

26:09.921 --> 26:11.255
Alfred, please.

26:11.289 --> 26:13.591
You said you could
give me a child.

26:13.625 --> 26:15.476
Now I find out you went
through menopause

26:15.510 --> 26:17.645
during
the Clinton administration.

26:17.679 --> 26:19.230
Second term. Second term.

26:19.264 --> 26:20.564
Good-bye, Genevieve.

26:20.599 --> 26:22.483
Can't we just talk about this?

26:22.517 --> 26:25.853
No. There is no "we"
anymore.

26:34.312 --> 26:36.864
Okay. Okay.
I know you're upset.

26:36.915 --> 26:38.582
But I didn't mean to tell him.

26:38.617 --> 26:40.668
- It was a slip of the tongue.
- Ha!

26:40.702 --> 26:43.037
You've been wanting
to sabotage this relationship

26:43.088 --> 26:45.039
since the moment
I brought Alfred home.

26:45.090 --> 26:46.040
This was no accident.

26:46.091 --> 26:47.708
Don't blame this on me.

26:47.759 --> 26:49.710
You shouldn't have been lying
to Alfred in the first place.

26:49.761 --> 26:51.828
Oh, please. Every woman
lies about her age.

26:51.847 --> 26:54.215
That's not the lie
I'm talking about.

26:54.266 --> 26:56.600
What?

26:56.635 --> 27:00.938
You made that man think
you love him.

27:00.972 --> 27:02.940
I do love him.

27:02.974 --> 27:06.677
Yeah, you're crazy about him.

27:06.695 --> 27:10.147
But only because he's rich.

27:10.181 --> 27:13.517
You really think
the worst of me...

27:13.535 --> 27:17.154
That I'm just some
shallow gold digger.

27:17.188 --> 27:21.125
But Alfred is kind to me.

27:21.159 --> 27:24.027
He makes me feel safe.

27:24.045 --> 27:28.132
He tells me he's lucky
to have me.

27:28.166 --> 27:31.034
And when I'm with him,

27:31.052 --> 27:35.872
I actually feel like
I'm 39 again.

27:35.891 --> 27:39.260
Who couldn't love
a man like that?

27:47.769 --> 27:50.187
There we go.

27:50.221 --> 27:52.606
Where have you been?!

27:52.657 --> 27:54.891
While we were at the park,
Tucker seemed cold.

27:54.910 --> 27:56.610
So I wheeled him down
to Barneys.

27:56.661 --> 27:58.228
What do you think
of the jacket?

27:58.246 --> 27:59.697
It's been two hours.

27:59.731 --> 28:02.199
I've been calling and calling.
You never picked up!

28:02.233 --> 28:03.834
Oh. I must have left
my phone here.

28:03.868 --> 28:06.837
I went to the park.
I knocked on people's doors.

28:06.871 --> 28:08.289
Rosie, there's no need
for all this hand-wringing.

28:08.340 --> 28:10.708
The boy is back.
He's fine.

28:10.742 --> 28:12.743
Looking incredibly stylish,
I might add.

28:12.761 --> 28:15.045
You can't take him places
without telling me.

28:15.080 --> 28:17.131
- That's wrong.
- You were worried. I get it.

28:17.182 --> 28:19.633
I don't suppose you considered
channeling any of that anxiety

28:19.684 --> 28:21.352
into actual housework?

28:21.386 --> 28:23.020
No, no.
You don't make jokes.

28:23.054 --> 28:24.254
This is serious.

28:24.272 --> 28:26.590
You don't take the baby
anymore.

28:26.625 --> 28:29.627
I would advise you
to mind your tone.

28:29.661 --> 28:31.962
Remember, you are
an employee in this house.

28:31.997 --> 28:34.982
Not anymore.

28:35.033 --> 28:36.817
What are you doing?

28:36.868 --> 28:38.702
I am taking the baby home.

28:38.737 --> 28:40.270
No, you don't need to do that.

28:40.288 --> 28:42.656
This is
a silly misunderstanding.

28:42.707 --> 28:46.660
Mrs. Peri trusts me
to take care of her baby.

28:48.330 --> 28:50.664
And that's what I'm gonna do.

29:04.396 --> 29:07.348
I'm home!

29:07.399 --> 29:10.234
You might want to
take it up to the bedroom.

29:11.969 --> 29:13.737
Olivia?

29:13.772 --> 29:15.189
Hello, Marisol.

29:15.240 --> 29:17.474
What are you doing here?

29:17.492 --> 29:20.444
Michael and I need
to have a talk.

29:20.478 --> 29:22.196
A talk?

29:22.247 --> 29:23.647
And I thought
we might as well have it

29:23.665 --> 29:25.699
over a nice home-cooked meal.

29:25.750 --> 29:27.451
It's been a while
since he's had my pot roast.

29:27.485 --> 29:30.704
He's probably forgotten
how much he likes it.

29:30.755 --> 29:34.458
Listen, I'm sorry.

29:34.492 --> 29:36.043
But you are gonna
have to leave.

29:36.094 --> 29:37.661
No.

29:37.679 --> 29:40.497
No. Not until
I get some answers.

29:40.515 --> 29:42.800
About what?

29:42.834 --> 29:45.335
Well... for starters,

29:45.353 --> 29:48.188
why is he trying to impregnate
that slut he's married to?

29:48.223 --> 29:50.340
Yeah.

29:50.358 --> 29:53.944
Joan Fisher told me
she saw Taylor at the Bundy Clinic.

29:53.978 --> 29:56.780
- Oh.
- So...

29:56.815 --> 29:58.232
I just need to know
what he's thinking.

29:58.283 --> 30:00.484
Is he just humoring her?

30:00.518 --> 30:03.287
I see you're upset.

30:03.321 --> 30:06.457
Okay. You were the one
who told me he still loves me.

30:06.491 --> 30:08.024
I've put my life on hold

30:08.043 --> 30:09.960
waiting for him to get away
from that woman.

30:09.994 --> 30:13.380
But if she has a baby,
he'll be trapped forever.

30:13.415 --> 30:14.928
Olivia, you just...

30:14.998 --> 30:16.860
You swore to me he loves me,
right?

30:16.868 --> 30:18.234
Right?

30:18.269 --> 30:20.245
Doesn't Michael love me?

30:29.046 --> 30:30.431
No.

30:39.491 --> 30:42.943
So... you lied to me?

30:42.994 --> 30:44.078
Yes.

30:49.567 --> 30:52.419
Why?

30:52.454 --> 30:56.090
You were so angry and hurt.

30:56.124 --> 31:00.294
You were threatening
to expose Taylor's past.

31:00.345 --> 31:02.930
I thought if you had time
to heal,

31:02.964 --> 31:07.101
it would help you accept
the situation.

31:09.888 --> 31:11.855
But I did lie.

31:11.890 --> 31:13.941
And for that...

31:13.975 --> 31:15.476
I am sorry.

31:24.435 --> 31:28.605
It's not enough...
to say, "I'm... I'm sorry"

31:28.623 --> 31:32.493
when you've ruined
someone's life.

31:53.464 --> 31:56.016
What do you mean, you quit?

31:56.067 --> 31:58.986
I don't like working for
Mrs. Evelyn. She's very rude.

31:59.020 --> 32:01.438
But we are so close
to finding out who killed Flora.

32:01.472 --> 32:03.473
And I feel bad about that.

32:03.491 --> 32:07.161
But she took the baby shopping
without asking me.

32:07.195 --> 32:09.112
I know, and that was wrong.

32:09.146 --> 32:10.831
But I need you in that house.

32:10.865 --> 32:15.035
I looked for the DVD.
It wasn't there.

32:15.086 --> 32:16.820
Maybe it's somewhere else
in the house.

32:16.838 --> 32:19.185
If you could just go back
for one...

32:19.191 --> 32:20.985
- No!
- Damn, Rosie.

32:21.020 --> 32:24.127
This is my son's life
we're talking about.

32:24.161 --> 32:26.964
Your son is not
the only son in the world.

32:26.998 --> 32:30.184
And I don't feel comfortable
bringing Tucker into that house.

32:30.218 --> 32:32.302
That woman...

32:32.336 --> 32:35.606
- She's strange.
- No, Evelyn is perfectly fine.

32:37.308 --> 32:38.842
That's a lie.

32:38.860 --> 32:42.012
Yeah. I can tell now
when you're lying.

32:42.030 --> 32:45.115
You probably lie so much,
you don't even know anymore.

32:53.190 --> 32:54.541
I'm sorry.

32:54.576 --> 32:56.793
That was mean.

33:00.298 --> 33:01.698
But it's true.

33:01.716 --> 33:04.885
I-I am so desperate
to help Eddie,

33:04.919 --> 33:08.538
I will say anything.
I will do anything.

33:08.556 --> 33:11.425
I keep telling myself
the end justifies the means,

33:11.476 --> 33:15.145
but I'm hurting people.

33:15.179 --> 33:16.546
That's not right.

33:16.564 --> 33:20.017
I wish I could help.

33:20.051 --> 33:24.438
I know. But you did
everything you could.

33:24.489 --> 33:27.157
I will find some other way.

33:45.176 --> 33:47.594
Mr. Pettigrove?

33:47.629 --> 33:49.429
Are you okay?

33:49.464 --> 33:51.081
I'm sorry.

33:51.099 --> 33:55.752
It's just, I'm 76 years old,
and I've never been married.

33:55.770 --> 33:59.255
I thought my time
had finally come.

34:01.526 --> 34:03.527
Can I ask you something?

34:03.561 --> 34:05.479
Of course.

34:05.530 --> 34:09.616
What if you had lied to her
about having money?

34:09.650 --> 34:13.436
Would it be okay
for her to walk out on you?

34:13.454 --> 34:14.771
That's different.

34:14.789 --> 34:16.489
A woman shouldn't want
to marry a man

34:16.541 --> 34:18.792
just because he's rich.

34:18.826 --> 34:20.494
And a man shouldn't want
to marry a woman

34:20.545 --> 34:22.996
just because she can
have his baby...

34:26.083 --> 34:27.967
- If you don't mind me saying.
- No, not at all.

34:28.002 --> 34:30.670
I like that you have
strong opinions.

34:30.722 --> 34:32.956
So many young people don't.

34:32.974 --> 34:35.759
I know
it's none of my business,

34:35.793 --> 34:39.563
but I've known Mrs. Delatour
my whole life.

34:39.597 --> 34:43.483
She's so fun and totally sweet.

34:43.518 --> 34:46.268
I think you'd really like
being married to her.

34:46.303 --> 34:49.472
But she lied to me.

34:49.489 --> 34:51.641
There's this boy.

34:51.659 --> 34:54.411
I'm totally in love with him.

34:54.445 --> 34:56.530
And he did something

34:56.581 --> 34:58.749
way worse than lying.

34:58.783 --> 35:01.752
But I know he feels awful
about it.

35:01.786 --> 35:04.487
So I found a way
to forgive him.

35:04.505 --> 35:09.593
Well, I'm not good
at forgiving people.

35:09.627 --> 35:14.181
Maybe that's why you're 76
and never been married.

35:21.389 --> 35:24.441
I can't believe I let you
leave the other day

35:24.475 --> 35:25.642
without paying you.

35:25.676 --> 35:27.343
That was insensitive of me.

35:27.362 --> 35:29.613
You're paying me now,
so I'm good.

35:29.647 --> 35:32.532
I'll just get some cash
out of the safe if that's okay?

35:32.567 --> 35:34.067
Sounds great.

35:38.289 --> 35:39.856
I also want to apologize again

35:39.874 --> 35:42.192
for my little field trip
with the baby.

35:42.210 --> 35:43.493
I have thought about it,

35:43.527 --> 35:45.545
and I realize
I was completely in the wrong.

35:45.580 --> 35:47.164
People make mistakes.

35:47.198 --> 35:48.665
It's been a long time
since I've enjoyed the company

35:48.699 --> 35:50.801
of such an adorable child.

35:50.835 --> 35:54.204
I was so taken with him,
I... just lost track of time.

36:00.211 --> 36:02.345
You know, Rosie...

36:02.379 --> 36:05.232
It was good for me
to spend time with him.

36:05.266 --> 36:08.819
Brought back a
lot of wonderful memories.

36:08.853 --> 36:11.238
Got me to thinking...
Is there any way you would

36:11.272 --> 36:13.740
consider coming back
to work here

36:13.775 --> 36:16.576
and... letting
the baby tag along?

36:16.611 --> 36:20.447
I don't think so.

36:20.498 --> 36:21.865
Are you sure?

36:21.899 --> 36:23.750
Because it really would
mean the world to me.

36:31.209 --> 36:32.793
I guess I could consider it.

36:32.844 --> 36:36.680
Rosie, I'm so glad!

36:59.188 --> 37:00.221
What is that?

37:00.239 --> 37:01.440
A little present from

37:01.491 --> 37:03.558
the progressive state
of California.

37:05.161 --> 37:07.996
It's medical marijuana.

37:09.532 --> 37:11.249
I know from my experience
with my mom,

37:11.284 --> 37:13.952
the painkillers
don't always work.

37:16.255 --> 37:18.457
They don't.

37:18.508 --> 37:21.409
We may not be friends.

37:21.427 --> 37:24.046
I may not know
anything about you,

37:24.080 --> 37:25.964
but that doesn't mean
I can't care

37:26.015 --> 37:28.183
about what happens to you.

37:31.521 --> 37:32.637
Follow.

37:43.232 --> 37:44.366
What is this?

37:44.400 --> 37:47.369
You want to know me?
This is who I am.

37:47.403 --> 37:50.438
Or at least...
it's who I used to be.

37:50.456 --> 37:52.541
You were a ballerina?

37:52.575 --> 37:55.243
I was a principal dancer
with the Nevsky Ballet.

37:56.579 --> 37:59.581
For six years I danced
in all the great ballets.

37:59.615 --> 38:02.551
"Swan Lake," "Romeo and Juliet,"
"Coppélia."

38:02.585 --> 38:05.253
I bet you were amazing.

38:05.287 --> 38:07.639
I was...

38:07.673 --> 38:11.343
Until I got cancer in my leg.

38:11.394 --> 38:14.229
The doctors said they'd have
to cut it off to save my life,

38:14.263 --> 38:16.732
but...

38:16.766 --> 38:19.184
my life was over just the same.

38:22.739 --> 38:24.139
So why did you leave Russia?

38:24.157 --> 38:27.659
I used to hear people
shout for me.

38:27.693 --> 38:30.311
"La Burakov!"
"Bravissima!"

38:30.329 --> 38:33.281
After I lost my leg,
all I heard was,

38:33.315 --> 38:36.952
"I'm so sorry.
Is there anything I can do?"

38:36.986 --> 38:40.338
I do not care for
the sound of sympathy.

38:42.658 --> 38:44.626
Then I guess I've been
pretty annoying

38:44.660 --> 38:45.660
these last few days.

38:45.678 --> 38:47.596
No, you're always annoying.

38:49.298 --> 38:52.167
But the brownie...

38:52.185 --> 38:54.469
that was nice.

38:54.503 --> 38:57.172
You're welcome.

39:01.027 --> 39:03.779
So do you want
to read me your reviews?

39:05.698 --> 39:07.482
- Well, maybe just one.
- Yes.

39:09.068 --> 39:11.536
This one is from
the "St. Petersburg Observer."

39:11.571 --> 39:14.122
I danced the title role
in "Giselle."

39:14.157 --> 39:15.373
The critic writes,

39:15.408 --> 39:17.659
"The moment Odessa Burakov
enters the stage,

39:17.693 --> 39:19.795
"a hush comes over
the audience.

39:19.829 --> 39:21.630
"The entire theater is beguiled

39:21.664 --> 39:24.749
by the delicate grace
that exudes from the stage."

39:24.801 --> 39:29.137
Hmm. Not bad, huh?

39:31.207 --> 39:35.227
I heard you wanted to see me.

39:35.261 --> 39:39.381
I've decided I can forgive you.

39:39.415 --> 39:41.233
Really?

39:41.267 --> 39:45.487
Oh, Alfred.

39:45.521 --> 39:46.721
Under one condition.

39:46.739 --> 39:48.907
Anything, my darling.
You name it.

39:48.941 --> 39:52.727
I will marry you
if I can still be a father.

39:52.745 --> 39:55.664
And how is that going to work?

39:55.698 --> 39:58.116
Well, we'll take advantage
of modern technology.

39:58.167 --> 40:01.536
We can get a surrogate
to carry the child.

40:01.570 --> 40:04.122
Yes, of course.

40:04.173 --> 40:07.092
And I just know we can
find someone wonderful.

40:07.126 --> 40:09.294
And we'll need someone
to give us an egg.

40:09.345 --> 40:11.213
Again, shouldn't be a problem.

40:11.247 --> 40:14.749
But on this issue,
I'm a bit more demanding.

40:14.767 --> 40:16.885
It's an unorthodox request,

40:16.919 --> 40:19.754
but I must feel comfortable
with the donor.

40:19.772 --> 40:22.390
I need to know something
about her.

40:22.425 --> 40:26.294
After all, if I'm mixing
my D.N.A. with hers...

40:26.329 --> 40:27.362
Alfred...

40:27.396 --> 40:30.398
Exactly what are you
suggesting?

40:30.432 --> 40:35.153
I want Valentina to give us
one of her eggs.

40:38.958 --> 40:42.327
- So you saw a DVD in the safe?
- Yeah.

40:42.378 --> 40:43.745
It had Flora's name on it.

40:43.779 --> 40:45.797
That has to be the one.
You've gotta get it.

40:45.831 --> 40:47.916
How am I supposed to do that?

40:47.950 --> 40:50.886
- The next time you're at work...
- Mm-hmm.

40:50.920 --> 40:54.956
You give Evelyn
the baby for a little while.

40:54.974 --> 40:59.644
Then tell her you need time
to get your work done.

40:59.679 --> 41:02.764
Then you go into the study.

41:02.798 --> 41:04.316
And you open the safe.

41:05.685 --> 41:07.635
But I only saw her put in
the first two letters

41:07.653 --> 41:08.803
of the combination.

41:08.821 --> 41:11.306
What were they?

41:11.324 --> 41:13.575
B-A.

41:13.609 --> 41:17.162
Try "Barrett."

41:17.196 --> 41:22.584
B-A-R-R-E-T-T.

41:27.757 --> 41:30.709
How do you know that?

41:30.760 --> 41:34.796
It was the name of someone
she loved...

41:34.830 --> 41:37.682
very, very much.

41:45.305 --> 41:51.476
