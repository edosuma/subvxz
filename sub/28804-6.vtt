-No.

it's tomorrow

and then we can talk?

43:30.172 --> 43:32.798
But right now, you need
to go home to your wife,

43:32.881 --> 43:34.798
in one piece.

43:34.881 --> 43:36.964

your problem is?

that you won't admit to.
That is your problem.

these things. You need 'em.

to be unconscious, would ya?

1:00:24.923 --> 1:00:26.881
You in some kinda trouble

SEBASTIAN GUTIERREZ:
In episode six,

1:00:53.547 --> 1:00:57.464
the heist of this precious car
in Portsmouth

1:00:57.547 --> 1:01:01.297
is important because Jett calls
a former partner called McKay,

1:01:01.381 --> 1:01:03.464
who is gonna play a big part
in the rest of the season

1:01:03.547 --> 1:01:06.214
'cause she needs a team
to try and steal this car.

The job itself
is not very complicated.

We see Jett in her element.

1:01:13.714 --> 1:01:15.798

(LOCKS CLICK)

JETT KOWALSKI:
These people have no taste.

1:01:20.089 --> 1:01:22.714
CARLA GUGINO:
She walks into a house
that she knows no connection to,

1:01:22.798 --> 1:01:24.839
and she sees a picture
of Charlie Baudelaire.

1:01:24.923 --> 1:01:27.923
And... that is a big moment
of realization for Jett

1:01:28.005 --> 1:01:30.255
because these jobs
aren't random,

1:01:30.339 --> 1:01:33.506
and they're all tied together
by one thing, which is Charlie.

1:01:33.964 --> 1:01:35.881
GUTIERREZ: One of the banes
of Jett's existence

1:01:35.964 --> 1:01:37.297
is things getting out
of control,

1:01:37.381 --> 1:01:41.005
not because somebody smarter
than you has outwitted you,

1:01:41.089 --> 1:01:43.631
but because stupid people
are doing stupid things.

the front gate from there?

JETT: Tell me it isn't

GUTIERREZ: Vicky is
a small town femme fatale

1:01:50.923 --> 1:01:53.881
trying to figure out her way
out of this town.

JETT: Join us.

1:01:54.964 --> 1:01:56.381

She ends up having an affair

1:01:56.464 --> 1:01:57.839
with the doctor
that she's working with,

1:01:57.964 --> 1:02:00.964
but also has a boyfriend
who messes things up even worse.

1:02:01.047 --> 1:02:04.422
-I've been missing you all day.
-Stop.

1:02:04.506 --> 1:02:05.547
When's this job?

1:02:05.631 --> 1:02:07.172
Just be sure they don't see you.

1:02:07.255 --> 1:02:09.547
All the men around her
are not super bright.

1:02:09.631 --> 1:02:11.214
She's much brighter
than all of them,

1:02:11.297 --> 1:02:13.297
and Jett realizes that

1:02:13.381 --> 1:02:15.631
the way she can control
the situation is through Vicky.

1:02:15.714 --> 1:02:17.464
-She doesn't know anything.
-So whatever he promises you

1:02:17.547 --> 1:02:19.923
or tells you is fine with us,
as long as you keep him

1:02:20.005 --> 1:02:22.047
away from that place
for the next few days.

1:02:22.130 --> 1:02:23.422
Think you can manage that?

1:02:23.506 --> 1:02:24.589
Of course.

1:02:25.506 --> 1:02:27.130
Now everybody's
on the same page.

1:02:27.214 --> 1:02:29.047
GUTIERREZ: You can be
so good at what you do,

1:02:29.130 --> 1:02:31.964
but if something
that doesn't make any sense

1:02:32.214 --> 1:02:34.589
surprises you,
it might take you down.

1:02:34.673 --> 1:02:37.547
And for a moment,
Henry's ineptitude

1:02:37.631 --> 1:02:38.673
throws her off her game,

1:02:38.756 --> 1:02:41.089
and it puts Jett
in a lot of danger.

1:02:41.422 --> 1:02:44.005
HENRY:
Put it down. No fast moves.

GUGINO: As fate would have it,

1:02:45.631 --> 1:02:47.214
in the same way
that she went to prison

1:02:47.297 --> 1:02:50.005
probably for one
of her lesser crimes,

1:02:50.214 --> 1:02:53.130
she is knocked out
by one of her lesser foes.

1:02:53.673 --> 1:02:54.714

GUGINO:
We're not sure what happens,

and we don't end up seeing her
for quite some time.
