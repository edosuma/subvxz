01:17.828 --> 01:21.248
Please, sir,
can I go to the loo?

01:21.290 --> 01:23.459
Jacob. Again?

01:23.501 --> 01:26.754
Straight over to the loo, then
right back to bed. Not a sound.

01:26.796 --> 01:28.756
Yes. Thank you, sir.

01:42.436 --> 01:44.313
Oh, please!

04:18.968 --> 04:21.928
- Master Thorne.
- Rycroft.

04:21.971 --> 04:24.181
Good to see you, sir.

04:24.223 --> 04:26.850
Would that it were
on a happier day.

04:55.295 --> 04:56.839
That's a hoof print.

04:59.800 --> 05:03.387
This one looks more like a Trow.

05:06.807 --> 05:10.185
Doesn't make any sense.

05:10.227 --> 05:12.312
- Take a look over there.
- Okay.

07:15.853 --> 07:17.563
Well done nicking this,

07:17.604 --> 07:19.565
right out from under
their fucking noses.

07:19.606 --> 07:21.400
I didn't think
you had it in you.

07:21.441 --> 07:23.586
Oh. Well, that is far from
the whole of what I have in me.

07:23.610 --> 07:25.320
Oh, don't get ahead of yourself.

07:25.362 --> 07:27.298
You'll start out on deliveries
and work your way up,

07:27.322 --> 07:28.740
just like everyone else.

07:28.782 --> 07:30.617
You'll be shadowing Oona.

07:30.659 --> 07:33.287
- She'll show you the ropes.
- Good to meet you.

07:33.328 --> 07:37.958
But... if you need anything,
anything at all,

07:38.000 --> 07:39.543
you just let me know.

07:39.585 --> 07:42.171
I will, thank you.

07:44.256 --> 07:47.134
- He seems like a nice enough lad.
- Yeah.

07:47.176 --> 07:50.220
Be careful of that one.

07:50.262 --> 07:51.388
Why?

07:51.430 --> 07:53.473
He's looking to fuck you.

07:53.515 --> 07:54.558
What?

07:54.600 --> 07:56.310
No.

07:56.351 --> 07:57.728
How can you tell?

07:57.769 --> 07:59.730
He told me so.

07:59.771 --> 08:02.024
Oh.

08:02.065 --> 08:03.734
Brothers and sisters,

08:03.775 --> 08:07.446
I had expected to be the bearer
of good news this morning.

08:07.487 --> 08:10.699
A shipment of lixir
from the jungles of Mag Mor.

08:10.741 --> 08:14.369
But it would seem
it has been confiscated

08:14.411 --> 08:17.831
by the constabulary.

08:17.873 --> 08:20.417
We have a cricket in our midst.

08:20.459 --> 08:23.253
Someone's been chirping.

08:25.505 --> 08:30.302
I realize our work is a far cry
from the lives we left behind.

08:30.344 --> 08:33.889
We are not accustomed
to the shadows.

08:33.931 --> 08:36.265
We were not born outlaws.

08:36.308 --> 08:39.394
We have chosen
to live outside the law,

08:39.436 --> 08:41.897
because the law
of this city is not ours.

08:41.938 --> 08:44.983
It does not protect us.

08:45.025 --> 08:47.402
Not even you,

08:47.444 --> 08:49.863
my little cricket.

08:52.032 --> 08:54.201
Whatever they've told you,

08:54.243 --> 08:55.953
it was a lie.

08:55.994 --> 08:58.789
They will use you to crush
your brothers and sisters,

08:58.830 --> 09:02.042
and then they will crush you.

09:02.084 --> 09:05.045
You have two choices.

09:05.087 --> 09:08.715
Show me you wish
to be made clean.

09:08.757 --> 09:11.134
Step forward, here and now,
and I swear,

09:11.176 --> 09:12.970
my hand to the heart
of Saint Titania,

09:13.011 --> 09:14.471
no harm will come to you.

09:20.686 --> 09:22.896
Or you can hide,

09:22.938 --> 09:26.733
force me to hunt you down,

09:26.775 --> 09:30.320
and I will see you torn
from the sky

09:30.362 --> 09:32.948
and fed to the eels,

09:32.990 --> 09:35.409
like garbage.

09:38.829 --> 09:41.331
What will it be?

09:48.422 --> 09:50.799
So be it.

09:50.841 --> 09:54.052
May the gods have mercy on you,
little cricket.

09:54.094 --> 09:56.805
I will not.

10:08.442 --> 10:10.402
And what are your plans
for the day, brother?

10:10.444 --> 10:12.404
I'm meeting my solicitor
at the office

10:12.446 --> 10:16.074
to discuss which bank
to approach for a loan.

10:16.116 --> 10:17.492
I see.

10:21.455 --> 10:24.833
I'm not at all sure how to take
your lack of objection.

10:24.875 --> 10:26.835
What do I know
about such matters?

10:26.877 --> 10:28.670
Hardly comes under
"what to wear"

10:28.712 --> 10:30.630
or "who's been seen with whom."

10:33.967 --> 10:36.928
That was very unkind of me,

10:36.970 --> 10:39.598
and I'm sorry to have said it.

10:46.730 --> 10:48.106
You're sulking.

10:48.148 --> 10:49.983
Don't think I don't see.

10:50.025 --> 10:52.152
All I know is your brother
wouldn't think much of you

10:52.194 --> 10:55.238
inviting a gussied-up Puck
over for tea.

10:55.280 --> 10:57.908
I'll boil your horns
if Ezra finds out about this.

10:57.949 --> 10:59.743
Then why risk it?

10:59.785 --> 11:01.411
Because I have no choice.

11:01.453 --> 11:03.955
He would lose the roof
over our heads,

11:03.997 --> 11:06.166
yet I am incompetent.

11:08.168 --> 11:09.961
My brother is a dear soul,

11:10.003 --> 11:11.630
but he lacks
our father's mettle.

11:11.671 --> 11:13.215
This wouldn't be the first time

11:13.256 --> 11:15.217
he's been taken advantage of
in business.

11:15.258 --> 11:19.429
But it is the last time
I pretend to look away.

11:21.431 --> 11:22.974
Take this across to the Puck.

11:23.016 --> 11:24.643
- What is it?
- A note

11:24.684 --> 11:26.496
explaining that we're
in the middle of sprucing

11:26.520 --> 11:28.730
and to please come round
to the servants' entrance.

11:28.772 --> 11:30.357
What would the neighbors think

11:30.399 --> 11:32.335
if they saw a Puck walking in
through our front door?

11:32.359 --> 11:35.445
Then why have him here
in the first place?

11:35.487 --> 11:37.048
Because he's positively
desperate for acceptance

11:37.072 --> 11:39.199
into polite society.

11:39.241 --> 11:42.619
Imagine his gratitude
at being invited to the home

11:42.661 --> 11:45.622
of one of the most prominent
families in the Burgue.

11:45.664 --> 11:48.500
Who knows what dividends
that gratitude might yield?

11:48.542 --> 11:51.503
You'd ask him for monies
over harken cake?

11:51.545 --> 11:53.588
Certainly not.

11:53.630 --> 11:56.174
But I might just...
see my way round

11:56.216 --> 11:57.676
to making passing mention

11:57.717 --> 12:00.846
to my brother's many
canny business ventures.

12:00.887 --> 12:03.348
It may be that,
in his eagerness to please,

12:03.390 --> 12:05.016
he'll rise to the bait.

12:05.058 --> 12:06.935
Better Ezra take money

12:06.977 --> 12:10.230
from a gullible Puck than
those vultures on State Street.

12:18.321 --> 12:20.866
The boys are telling me
you got a good look

12:20.907 --> 12:23.034
at the bloke that did this.

12:23.076 --> 12:25.203
Whatever it was,
it wasn't a bloke.

12:25.245 --> 12:26.705
Trow?

12:26.746 --> 12:28.039
Bigger than a Trow.

12:28.081 --> 12:30.292
Not bloody likely.

12:30.333 --> 12:32.210
A bloke or a Trow

12:32.252 --> 12:34.129
or a fucking Kobold,

12:34.171 --> 12:36.381
why kill
an old orphan-meister anyway?

12:36.423 --> 12:37.966
Why kill a Pix entertainer?

12:38.008 --> 12:39.652
What's some dead whore
got to do with this?

12:39.676 --> 12:41.052
She wasn't a whore.

12:41.094 --> 12:42.387
Dr. Morange?

12:42.429 --> 12:43.972
Severe contusions.

12:44.014 --> 12:46.224
Multiple lacerations.

12:46.266 --> 12:49.060
Cause of death
was excessive exsanguination.

12:49.102 --> 12:51.980
Just like the fae singer.

12:52.022 --> 12:54.316
Who did the post on a dead Pix?

12:54.357 --> 12:55.817
Friend of mine did me a favor.

12:55.859 --> 12:57.235
Critch friend, was it?

12:57.277 --> 12:59.488
A Puck,
if it makes a difference.

12:59.529 --> 13:01.907
The... killer

13:01.948 --> 13:04.826
seemed preoccupied with this.

13:04.868 --> 13:07.537
The victim's liver.

13:07.579 --> 13:09.557
Can't make head or tail
of the incisions on it though.

13:09.581 --> 13:11.541
The liver? Are you sure?

13:11.583 --> 13:13.960
My patients may be deceased,
Inspector,

13:14.002 --> 13:16.129
but I can assure you
I can discern the difference

13:16.171 --> 13:18.298
between a liver
and other vital organs.

13:18.340 --> 13:21.134
Why would the killer extract
someone's liver?

13:21.176 --> 13:23.136
To kill them.

13:23.178 --> 13:25.597
Just guessing.

13:38.693 --> 13:41.279
Inspector. You're late.

13:41.321 --> 13:42.989
You knew I was coming?

13:43.031 --> 13:45.909
The ways of the Fane
can open a window to the future

13:45.951 --> 13:48.328
for those whose faith is true.

13:48.370 --> 13:50.997
That, and scuttle has it
you tried to put a bullet

13:51.039 --> 13:54.125
in some kind of "creature"
last night.

13:54.167 --> 13:56.503
How did folks put it?

13:56.545 --> 13:59.047
"Neither man nor fae"?

13:59.089 --> 14:00.632
Believe me now?

14:00.674 --> 14:02.842
Both the victims had
their livers removed. Why?

14:02.884 --> 14:04.469
For what purpose?

14:04.511 --> 14:07.138
I'm a holy woman.

14:07.180 --> 14:09.432
These are unholy matters.

14:09.474 --> 14:11.434
I'm afraid I can only speculate

14:11.476 --> 14:13.603
as to the reasoning
of such evil.

14:13.645 --> 14:15.605
Go ahead, speculate.

14:15.647 --> 14:18.650
Maybe the liver
is a prize of sorts.

14:18.692 --> 14:20.569
Its dark reward, perhaps.

14:20.610 --> 14:23.780
Why do I feel like you know more
than you're letting on?

14:23.822 --> 14:25.615
Because I do.

14:25.657 --> 14:28.410
But I've already told you
as much as you will believe.

14:31.246 --> 14:33.665
Try me.

14:36.418 --> 14:39.379
There's a story
in our oldest traditions

14:39.421 --> 14:41.881
of a beast called a Darkasher.

14:42.924 --> 14:45.343
Darkasher.

14:45.385 --> 14:49.097
A golem of flesh, fashioned
from the limbs of the dead

14:49.139 --> 14:52.267
and given new life,
new purpose.

14:52.309 --> 14:54.227
What are you saying?

14:54.269 --> 14:57.647
Some motley patchwork of corpses
has been raised from the dead?

14:57.689 --> 15:00.317
As Saint Titania herself said,

15:00.358 --> 15:04.654
there is a strange power
in the joining of unlike things.

15:08.825 --> 15:10.785
You still don't believe me.

15:10.827 --> 15:12.912
Sounds very far-fetched.

15:14.122 --> 15:16.082
How many more bodies will drop

15:16.124 --> 15:18.084
before it sounds anything else?

15:18.126 --> 15:20.086
I'm a rational man, Mima.

15:20.128 --> 15:22.088
I need to see such things
for myself.

15:22.130 --> 15:25.091
I don't traffic
in the dark arts.

15:25.133 --> 15:26.676
You want proof,

15:26.718 --> 15:29.679
there's a haruspex
with a shop off Vectis Square.

15:29.721 --> 15:32.015
- Hmm.
- You might see her about it.

15:32.057 --> 15:34.309
I might.

15:34.351 --> 15:36.269
Be careful, Inspector.

15:36.311 --> 15:38.772
Skepticism might keep you sane,

15:38.813 --> 15:41.983
but it won't necessarily
keep you alive.

16:04.297 --> 16:06.174
Good afternoon.

16:06.216 --> 16:08.760
I'm sorry that you had
to come through the back,

16:08.802 --> 16:12.555
but Miss Imogen is repainting
the entrance foyer.

16:12.597 --> 16:14.849
I'm sure you understand.

16:17.310 --> 16:19.020
Completely.

16:22.107 --> 16:24.442
Horrid weather we're having.

16:24.484 --> 16:27.320
With any luck,
it'll clear by Wrensday.

16:27.362 --> 16:28.738
Mm.

16:32.283 --> 16:34.703
You're from New Freehold,
I'm told.

16:34.744 --> 16:37.706
It was my former city
of residence, yes.

16:37.747 --> 16:39.791
But, of course,
I'm not from there.

16:39.833 --> 16:41.793
No, of course.

16:41.835 --> 16:44.921
My kin mined coal in Puyan
for generations.

16:44.963 --> 16:47.257
And then the war broke out,
and the Pact

16:47.298 --> 16:49.259
started conscripting
every able body they could.

16:49.300 --> 16:51.594
I was quick to ascertain
that the life

16:51.636 --> 16:54.264
of a Puck meant very little
to two warring armies of men

16:54.305 --> 16:56.725
and thus found my way
to New Freehold.

16:56.766 --> 16:58.309
Where you evidently prospered.

16:58.351 --> 17:00.770
It's a festering sore
of a place, to be certain.

17:00.812 --> 17:03.148
But I found
opportunity there, yes.

17:06.067 --> 17:07.861
Do you have any sugar?

17:08.903 --> 17:10.446
Yes.

17:13.616 --> 17:15.201
Thank you.

17:18.413 --> 17:21.415
I trust Finistere Crossing
has lived up to your hopes?

17:21.458 --> 17:25.086
Oh, its finery knows no peer.

17:25.127 --> 17:27.172
My only disappointment, though,

17:27.213 --> 17:29.883
is that I'm yet
to meet its residents.

17:31.217 --> 17:33.261
They're a bit bashful,
you understand.

17:33.303 --> 17:35.138
You're a rarity here.

17:35.180 --> 17:38.224
Some might say an impossibility.

17:38.266 --> 17:41.019
They'll find their way,
I'm certain of it.

17:41.060 --> 17:44.189
Well, thank you
for being the first.

17:44.230 --> 17:46.983
It's most kind
and most appreciated.

17:47.025 --> 17:49.486
Oh, we're actually quite
progressive, we Spurnroses.

17:49.527 --> 17:51.571
My father was first
in the Crossing

17:51.613 --> 17:53.031
to bring on a Faun cook.

17:53.072 --> 17:55.033
But it's one thing
to employ a Puck,

17:55.074 --> 17:57.285
and quite another
to have one over for tea.

17:57.327 --> 18:00.330
- Yet here you are!
- The one thing that I...

18:00.371 --> 18:02.791
keep coming back to...

18:02.832 --> 18:04.876
in my mind...

18:04.918 --> 18:07.295
is why?

18:07.337 --> 18:09.255
Why?

18:09.297 --> 18:11.841
I must confess, when I
first received your invitation,

18:11.883 --> 18:14.552
it left me wondering,
why would this young lady

18:14.594 --> 18:16.429
extend herself so?

18:16.471 --> 18:19.098
And what
would her neighbors think

18:19.140 --> 18:21.976
of her receiving a Puck
in her home?

18:22.018 --> 18:23.520
Like I said, we're progressive.

18:23.561 --> 18:25.814
I could give a toss
what the neighbors think.

18:25.855 --> 18:27.065
- Really?
- Mm.

18:27.106 --> 18:29.275
Then why have me
come around back...

18:29.317 --> 18:31.611
through the servants' entrance?

18:33.154 --> 18:35.323
Well, you saw for yourself
the parlor...

18:35.365 --> 18:37.575
Oh, come now, woman!
We both know

18:37.617 --> 18:39.953
this was a ruse,
and a shoddy one at that.

18:39.994 --> 18:43.164
I can think of only one reason
you would invite me here.

18:43.206 --> 18:45.124
And what would that be?

18:45.166 --> 18:46.501
Sport.

18:47.752 --> 18:49.712
- Sport?
- You wish to regale your friends

18:49.754 --> 18:51.130
in the smart set of tales

18:51.172 --> 18:53.132
of the ridiculous Puck
who came to call.

18:53.174 --> 18:55.468
Well, go on, then.

18:55.510 --> 18:57.011
I take three sugars in my tea,

18:57.053 --> 18:59.180
and I don't give a shite
who knows about it.

18:59.222 --> 19:00.866
I would thank you
not to use such language.

19:00.890 --> 19:02.100
Well, perhaps I should leave.

19:02.141 --> 19:03.977
Perhaps so.

19:06.521 --> 19:09.482
Mark me, Miss Imogen, mark me.

19:09.524 --> 19:12.277
The day will come
that your bashful neighbors

19:12.318 --> 19:15.822
will fight to shake my hand.

19:27.333 --> 19:29.460
We have watchful
eyes on Longerbane

19:29.502 --> 19:31.462
and his every known associate.

19:31.504 --> 19:33.172
Very good, Winetrout.

19:33.214 --> 19:35.049
Keep us informed.

19:40.138 --> 19:42.682
I dreamt of him last night.

19:45.226 --> 19:48.813
That summer by the sea.
Do you remember?

19:48.855 --> 19:51.190
What if sleep is the only place

19:51.232 --> 19:53.234
I'll hold my son again?

19:53.276 --> 19:56.237
Oh. Shh, shh, shh, shh.

19:56.279 --> 19:58.364
You must stay strong.

19:58.406 --> 20:00.450
I have this in hand.

20:00.491 --> 20:03.661
We know Longerbane has Jonah.
Why not arrest him now?

20:03.703 --> 20:06.456
Arrest him now,
and he'd deny everything.

20:06.497 --> 20:08.791
We'd never see the boy again.

20:08.833 --> 20:13.755
Understand, Longerbane's not
doing this merely to grieve us.

20:13.796 --> 20:16.674
He's after
the chancellorship as well.

20:16.716 --> 20:18.259
How so?

20:18.301 --> 20:20.887
Tell me.

20:20.929 --> 20:24.223
When the ransom demand comes,
it won't be for gold.

20:25.725 --> 20:27.852
It will exact that I step down

20:27.894 --> 20:31.022
in exchange
for Jonah's safe return.

20:31.064 --> 20:32.649
He can't very well admit

20:32.690 --> 20:35.068
to having been behind
the kidnapping, now, can he?

20:35.109 --> 20:37.195
Which means he'll
surely implicate someone else.

20:37.236 --> 20:40.281
- Mm-hmm.
- A group of disgruntled Critch, perhaps.

20:40.323 --> 20:42.116
They're his favorite hobbyhorse,
after all.

20:42.158 --> 20:45.453
Yeah. He's a wily little devil,
I'll give him that.

20:45.495 --> 20:47.455
But we are onto him.

20:47.497 --> 20:49.207
- Yeah.
- Hmm?

20:49.248 --> 20:51.793
Today, when we sit
in Parliament,

20:51.834 --> 20:54.337
he'll get nothing from me.

20:54.379 --> 20:57.548
No inkling that
we have discovered him.

21:04.097 --> 21:06.307
The majority seem determined

21:06.349 --> 21:10.436
to let these Critch remake
the face of our city.

21:10.478 --> 21:12.480
By the Martyr, soon enough

21:12.522 --> 21:14.482
there'll be more of them
than there are of us!

21:14.524 --> 21:18.444
- Where does it end?
- Where does it end?

21:18.486 --> 21:20.089
Well, it wouldn't
surprise me in the least

21:20.113 --> 21:21.465
if before long
Breakspear starts saying

21:21.489 --> 21:23.324
that the Critch
should be allowed to vote.

21:23.366 --> 21:25.368
Never! Never! Never!

21:25.410 --> 21:28.037
Maybe that's his secret plan
for staying in power.

21:29.664 --> 21:32.625
Yield the floor!
We've heard enough!

21:32.667 --> 21:34.794
The Critch are like a tide

21:34.836 --> 21:36.295
that will swamp

21:36.337 --> 21:38.381
- and drown our city.
- Yes!

21:38.423 --> 21:40.466
Make no mistake,
they will destroy us

21:40.508 --> 21:42.593
from without and within.

21:42.635 --> 21:45.555
Selling lixir
to men without hope.

21:45.596 --> 21:48.975
Selling coitus
to the weakest among us.

21:49.017 --> 21:51.269
You push me too far, Longerbane.

21:51.310 --> 21:53.271
Yield the floor!

21:53.312 --> 21:55.690
Yield the floor!

21:55.732 --> 21:58.276
If you have the votes
to silence me,

21:58.317 --> 22:00.278
conjure them now.

22:01.863 --> 22:03.948
Conjure my son!

22:05.283 --> 22:07.243
Your son?

22:07.285 --> 22:10.705
What the devil are you
talking about, Breakspear?

22:12.915 --> 22:14.834
You know full well.

22:20.798 --> 22:22.800
What have I done?

22:24.260 --> 22:27.597
Why couldn't I hold my tongue?

22:27.638 --> 22:30.641
Longerbane will
never give Jonah up now.

22:30.683 --> 22:34.312
It would be tantamount
to a full confession.

22:34.353 --> 22:36.064
And I...

22:36.105 --> 22:39.108
I dragged it out into the open
like a damn fool!

22:40.735 --> 22:43.404
You're my advisor, Winetrout.

22:44.989 --> 22:47.158
Advise me!

22:48.201 --> 22:49.744
Forgive me, sir, I...

22:49.786 --> 22:51.079
I can't.

22:51.120 --> 22:53.122
- Arrest him!
- Arrest Longerbane

22:53.164 --> 22:54.665
without proof?

22:54.707 --> 22:56.834
What choice do you have,
airing it as you've done?

22:56.876 --> 22:59.021
His coalition will appeal
the arrest to the High Court.

22:59.045 --> 23:01.964
- We'd not keep him for long.
- Long enough to pry

23:02.006 --> 23:03.966
the location of our son
from his lips

23:04.008 --> 23:06.260
by whatever means required.

23:06.302 --> 23:08.763
Once you've wrung Jonah
from him,

23:08.805 --> 23:12.016
his guilt will be plain
for all to see.

23:13.810 --> 23:16.187
Yes.

23:17.480 --> 23:18.773
Yes.

23:23.152 --> 23:25.696
Have the viper brought in.

23:29.450 --> 23:31.744
I'm sorry.

23:31.786 --> 23:34.580
Forgive me.

23:48.094 --> 23:50.263
- You said I was lost.
- You are.

23:50.304 --> 23:51.973
I know.

23:55.476 --> 23:57.061
I have been.

24:00.314 --> 24:03.568
I'm trapped
between two worlds, Vignette.

24:05.111 --> 24:08.197
For a while I thought
I could choose a third.

24:08.239 --> 24:10.366
A life with you.

24:11.742 --> 24:14.453
But that was selfish.

24:15.872 --> 24:18.291
Loving you meant letting you go.

24:20.710 --> 24:22.795
So do it.

24:51.866 --> 24:54.410
Thanks very much.

24:59.790 --> 25:01.500
The inspector.

25:01.542 --> 25:04.003
How could I help you?

25:04.045 --> 25:05.880
What's this?

25:10.426 --> 25:13.221
You want me to make
a nice stew, is that it?

25:13.262 --> 25:15.640
I want you to make me
a Darkasher.

25:15.681 --> 25:18.476
Take it you've laid eyes
on the beast yourself?

25:18.517 --> 25:21.896
I saw something.

25:21.938 --> 25:24.523
But I won't believe
it was raised from the dead

25:24.565 --> 25:26.567
till I see for myself

25:26.609 --> 25:28.819
if such a feat is even possible.

25:28.861 --> 25:30.529
Ha.

25:30.571 --> 25:33.908
And you would have me join
these two lifeless creatures

25:33.950 --> 25:36.994
so they breathe as one?

25:37.036 --> 25:38.621
Not so easy what you ask.

25:38.663 --> 25:40.224
It's all Critch bollocks,
then, isn't it?

25:40.248 --> 25:43.292
Ah, can't an old haruspex
haggle anymore?

25:43.334 --> 25:45.336
I'll pay you what you ask.

25:45.378 --> 25:47.880
Can you do it or not?

25:47.922 --> 25:50.841
A Darkasher
must have its master.

25:50.883 --> 25:53.010
It'll be bound to you

25:53.052 --> 25:54.804
to your last breath.

25:54.845 --> 25:57.848
Seems a long time
to have a bloody... mole fish.

25:57.890 --> 25:59.225
Bound to me how?

25:59.267 --> 26:02.228
From the life
that you must give.

26:02.270 --> 26:05.147
- What are you saying?
- I only require

26:05.189 --> 26:08.818
what would be your part
in any creation, Inspector.

26:09.860 --> 26:11.529
You can't mean...

26:12.738 --> 26:14.907
Your seed.

27:34.487 --> 27:36.614
I have what I need.

27:36.655 --> 27:38.616
Come back in a couple of days.

27:38.657 --> 27:42.870
Matters such as these
can't be rushed.

27:44.413 --> 27:46.165
If any of this is charlatanry,

27:46.207 --> 27:47.708
you old witch,

27:47.750 --> 27:49.835
there'll be hell to pay.

27:59.470 --> 28:01.138
It doesn't take a genius.

28:01.180 --> 28:02.723
Couriers leave packages
around town

28:02.765 --> 28:04.058
in places marked with chalk.

28:04.100 --> 28:05.660
Chalk tells you where
to take them. Simple as that.

28:05.684 --> 28:07.103
What's in the packages?

28:07.144 --> 28:08.813
Lixir. Contraband.

28:08.854 --> 28:10.439
Best not to ask.

28:10.481 --> 28:12.316
Look, they'll start you off
on a day route.

28:12.358 --> 28:14.235
Swap it out
as quick as you can, though.

28:14.276 --> 28:15.778
- Nights go faster.
- Why?

28:15.820 --> 28:17.488
You can fly
without being spotted.

28:17.530 --> 28:19.657
Daylighters have to leg it.

28:19.698 --> 28:21.659
What happens
if you're spotted flying?

28:21.700 --> 28:23.077
Well, they won't shoot you down,

28:23.119 --> 28:24.304
but they'll order
your wings clipped

28:24.328 --> 28:25.496
if they catch up with you.

28:25.538 --> 28:27.498
What do you need, Bol?

28:27.540 --> 28:28.999
Just the new one.

28:29.041 --> 28:31.001
Dahlia wants her.

28:34.505 --> 28:36.382
Oh, God.

28:36.424 --> 28:38.092
Please, please.

28:38.134 --> 28:40.219
What was the first rule
I gave you?

28:40.261 --> 28:41.887
I didn't talk to the police.

28:41.929 --> 28:45.224
Well, that's just patently
untrue, isn't it, Bolero?

28:45.266 --> 28:47.726
I saw you and the inspector,
the handsome one,

28:47.768 --> 28:51.522
on the Row, right out
in the open, plain as day.

28:51.564 --> 28:53.065
He's nobody.

28:53.107 --> 28:54.775
We used to fuck.

28:54.817 --> 28:57.153
Fucking them isn't better
than talking to them, lass.

28:57.194 --> 28:59.738
That was during the war.
He wasn't a copper back then.

28:59.780 --> 29:01.824
Well, he's a copper now,
isn't he?

29:02.867 --> 29:04.702
So, what did you talk about?

29:04.743 --> 29:06.454
Nothing.

29:06.495 --> 29:08.998
- Just our own stupid shit.
- Your own stupid shit?

29:09.039 --> 29:10.749
- Are you in love with this legger?
- No.

29:10.791 --> 29:13.043
I fucking hate the bastard,
trust me.

29:13.085 --> 29:14.312
Well, give us his address, then.

29:14.336 --> 29:15.522
We'll sew it up for you,
won't we?

29:15.546 --> 29:17.715
- I don't know it.
- All right, fuck this.

29:17.756 --> 29:19.192
- Hold her steady.
- No, please!

29:19.216 --> 29:22.094
- I'm... I'm not the informant!
- No.

29:22.136 --> 29:24.597
- You're a fucking liability.
- No, please.

29:24.638 --> 29:25.890
I'm an asset.

29:25.931 --> 29:28.392
I can...
I can help you find the cricket.

29:28.434 --> 29:30.978
Where are you gonna look?
Under Johnny Burgue's bollocks?

29:31.020 --> 29:33.105
What do you care
how I fucking find him?

29:37.318 --> 29:40.112
By midnight, you better be
standing in front of me

29:40.154 --> 29:41.614
with a name on your lips

29:41.655 --> 29:44.617
or halfway back to Tirnanoc.

29:50.581 --> 29:53.167
I never should have sent you
to those shits.

29:53.209 --> 29:54.752
It's not your fault.

29:54.793 --> 29:56.587
I should've just gotten you
a job here.

29:56.629 --> 29:59.215
No. No, you were right.
I wouldn't have felt free here.

29:59.256 --> 30:00.466
You'd be alive, at least.

30:00.508 --> 30:02.551
I'm not dead yet.

30:02.593 --> 30:04.470
I just need to find
that informant.

30:04.512 --> 30:06.472
What? Before tonight?

30:06.514 --> 30:08.825
- You're not serious, are you?
- What other choice do I have?

30:08.849 --> 30:10.785
Well, how about getting the fuck
out of town, for a start?

30:10.809 --> 30:12.811
No, I'm done running.

30:14.480 --> 30:16.732
And just how in Lunasa's hell
are you gonna find

30:16.774 --> 30:18.025
whoever it is that's talking?

30:18.067 --> 30:19.235
I'm working on it.

30:19.276 --> 30:21.237
Vignette, these Black Raven...

30:21.278 --> 30:22.905
Don't scare me.

30:22.947 --> 30:25.950
I've survived worse.
A lot worse.

30:27.535 --> 30:29.495
You're not invincible.

30:32.831 --> 30:36.252
There's a lot of hurt
you're not dealing with.

30:36.293 --> 30:39.505
Don't let it
make you do anything stupid.

30:39.547 --> 30:41.048
Please.

30:41.090 --> 30:42.675
If not for your own good,

30:42.716 --> 30:44.569
then for mine, because
I will never forgive myself

30:44.593 --> 30:46.845
if this Black Raven shit
gets you killed.

31:06.615 --> 31:10.369
I saw your alma mater
started admitting women.

31:10.411 --> 31:13.372
Farce in the making, no doubt.

31:13.414 --> 31:16.250
How else is a lady
to occupy herself?

31:16.292 --> 31:19.837
You had already led
two polar expeditions by my age.

31:19.878 --> 31:21.755
Yes.

31:21.797 --> 31:24.675
Hideous ordeal.

31:33.767 --> 31:37.146
Perhaps I'll attend
in the autumn.

31:37.187 --> 31:39.773
After a sabbatical.

31:39.815 --> 31:42.860
Touring the Beornlands.

31:42.901 --> 31:45.362
Or down south
to the Pharaonic Coast.

31:45.404 --> 31:48.282
A summer sailing
amidst the sunken tombs

31:48.324 --> 31:50.326
of my ancestors.

31:50.367 --> 31:52.077
Your ancestors.

31:52.119 --> 31:55.497
Your mother was born
in the embassy up the street.

31:55.539 --> 31:59.460
She couldn't so much as spell
her own name in Pharaonic.

31:59.501 --> 32:01.837
Well, God forbid

32:01.879 --> 32:04.131
a lady should want to know
much more than that.

32:04.173 --> 32:06.800
That she should want to see
anything at all

32:06.842 --> 32:08.510
of the world outside her house.

32:08.552 --> 32:10.554
Come now, Sophie.

32:10.596 --> 32:12.640
Your house is a bloody castle.

32:12.681 --> 32:15.476
Are there not enough books
in your library now?

32:15.517 --> 32:18.729
Evidently not, considering
I have read them all.

32:18.771 --> 32:20.105
Twice.

32:20.147 --> 32:21.982
Then read them slower next time.

32:22.024 --> 32:25.110
Because your ancestors' tombs
will turn to dust

32:25.152 --> 32:27.613
before I let you prance off
into the bush.

32:27.655 --> 32:29.490
Much less college.

32:33.661 --> 32:35.621
I wasn't asking your permission.

33:06.193 --> 33:10.572
Then go and see how far
you can get without it.

33:14.284 --> 33:16.912
Hey, you can't just barge
into a proctor's home.

33:16.954 --> 33:18.997
Proctor Longerbane,
the chancellor wants to see you.

33:19.039 --> 33:21.041
I don't care
what he bloody wants!

33:21.083 --> 33:23.544
Get your hands off me.
Don't you know who I am?

33:23.585 --> 33:25.587
It's outrageous!

33:31.009 --> 33:32.970
Done it this time, Breakspear.

33:33.011 --> 33:36.348
Using the chancellery guard
as your own personal thugs.

33:36.390 --> 33:38.851
I'll have your robes for this.

33:41.019 --> 33:43.063
Where's my son?

33:43.105 --> 33:44.481
Bastard!

33:44.523 --> 33:46.275
You're insane.

33:46.316 --> 33:50.237
As would you be if someone stole
your precious trophy from you.

33:50.279 --> 33:52.573
Where's Jonah?!

33:52.614 --> 33:54.467
I don't know
what you're talking about.

33:58.203 --> 34:01.039
Absalom, enough!

34:01.081 --> 34:03.959
He can't tell us anything
if he's beaten senseless.

34:04.001 --> 34:08.045
I simply have no idea what
either of you are talking about.

34:08.088 --> 34:10.632
Take him away.

34:10.674 --> 34:14.469
We shall devise some way
to jog his memory.

34:31.235 --> 34:32.862
I checked around like you asked.

34:32.905 --> 34:34.406
Learned a thing or two.

34:34.447 --> 34:36.992
- Such as?
- Apparently, the brother

34:37.034 --> 34:39.119
is casting around desperately
for a loan.

34:39.161 --> 34:42.371
So it wasn't for sport.

34:42.414 --> 34:44.708
Sir?

34:44.750 --> 34:47.418
Nothing. Well done, Fergus.

34:47.460 --> 34:50.130
Always knew
I could count on you.

34:50.172 --> 34:52.299
Can't help feel sorry for 'em.

34:52.341 --> 34:54.510
Poor girl's in for it,
spoiled or not.

34:54.551 --> 34:56.512
Yes, I'd imagine so.

35:09.107 --> 35:10.692
Ritter.

35:10.734 --> 35:13.445
Ritter?

35:13.487 --> 35:16.657
Something for the pain.

35:21.203 --> 35:23.163
Piety.

35:26.250 --> 35:28.836
Thank the Martyr you've come.

35:28.877 --> 35:31.129
I implored Absalom
to let me plead with you

35:31.171 --> 35:34.132
as Jonah's mother.

35:34.174 --> 35:35.801
Don't waste your breath.

35:35.843 --> 35:38.178
I've no idea where the boy is.

35:38.220 --> 35:40.264
It's rare
to witness such bravery

35:40.305 --> 35:42.266
in the face of such wrath.

35:42.307 --> 35:45.227
My husband has his hands full.

35:45.269 --> 35:47.479
It's not bravery.

35:47.521 --> 35:50.524
It's that I've nothing
to give up.

35:58.490 --> 36:00.576
Yes, but he doesn't know that.

36:07.040 --> 36:08.542
You...

36:10.127 --> 36:11.670
Say again?

36:11.712 --> 36:13.672
You're holding him where?

36:13.714 --> 36:15.757
What?

36:15.799 --> 36:17.843
The Copley Baths?

36:49.166 --> 36:51.168
Oh!

36:59.509 --> 37:02.137
What is it?

37:02.179 --> 37:04.431
Did the demon speak?

37:04.473 --> 37:07.517
I fear you were too hard on him.

37:07.559 --> 37:09.895
His body failed, and he...

37:09.937 --> 37:11.980
he passed before my eyes.

37:12.022 --> 37:13.231
Martyr be praised

37:13.273 --> 37:15.108
you let me plead with him.

37:15.150 --> 37:16.735
He confessed?

37:16.777 --> 37:18.153
The old Copley Baths.

37:18.195 --> 37:19.571
That's where he's holding Jonah.

37:19.613 --> 37:21.615
Oh!

37:25.661 --> 37:27.996
This is crap, is what this is!

37:28.038 --> 37:30.207
I wasn't doing a bloody thing!

37:30.248 --> 37:33.085
Well, then, you got nothing
to worry about, do you?

37:33.126 --> 37:36.129
Wait here, you shite.

37:45.138 --> 37:47.099
Hamlyn.

37:47.140 --> 37:49.643
Are you trying to get me killed,
Inspector?

37:49.685 --> 37:51.269
Dahlia's on a tear

37:51.311 --> 37:54.106
after your pal Dombey
broke up the lixir shipment.

37:54.147 --> 37:55.816
Dombey's not my pal,

37:55.857 --> 37:57.693
and your troubles
are not my concern.

37:57.734 --> 38:00.737
What is is we have a killer
on the loose.

38:00.779 --> 38:03.031
Well, it's not me,
and it's not the Raven.

38:03.073 --> 38:05.909
The only people they kill
are the ones who cross them.

38:05.951 --> 38:09.621
Like, say, getting caught
ratting out to the cops.

38:09.663 --> 38:12.040
I'm pursuing
an unorthodox angle.

38:12.082 --> 38:15.752
Some...
beast made of dead things...

38:15.794 --> 38:18.422
Puck, Trow and the like...

38:18.463 --> 38:20.132
might've been responsible.

38:22.134 --> 38:23.844
You're fucking crazy.

38:25.887 --> 38:28.098
I'm waiting on evidence.

38:28.140 --> 38:29.766
But in the meantime,
I got to thinking,

38:29.808 --> 38:32.144
who could procure
a bunch of dead corpses?

38:32.185 --> 38:34.146
Coroner.

38:34.187 --> 38:37.357
Maybe you should have a chat
with your friend Dr. Morange.

38:37.399 --> 38:39.276
I'm having a chat with you.

38:39.317 --> 38:43.280
Morange doesn't concern himself
with dead fae.

38:43.321 --> 38:45.991
Neither does the Raven.

38:46.033 --> 38:49.703
But... I've heard tell
of one of us.

38:49.745 --> 38:51.538
Wren.

38:51.580 --> 38:53.915
She might've gotten
some side work digging up

38:53.957 --> 38:55.625
the kind of things
you're talking about.

38:55.667 --> 38:57.753
- For who?
- Don't remember.

38:57.794 --> 39:00.130
Didn't make much
of an impression on me.

39:00.172 --> 39:03.175
Had kind of a religious name,
I think.

39:03.216 --> 39:05.886
I'll need to talk to this Wren.

39:05.927 --> 39:08.638
Then you'll need
to dig her up, too.

39:08.680 --> 39:11.433
Dahlia tossed Wren off a roof
two nights ago.

39:11.475 --> 39:14.227
Said it was because she didn't
trust her anymore, but ask me,

39:14.269 --> 39:17.606
I think it was over
this side action of hers.

39:17.647 --> 39:20.275
So...

39:20.317 --> 39:22.986
can I get out of here now?

39:23.028 --> 39:25.197
In a couple of hours.

39:25.238 --> 39:27.699
We wouldn't want Dahlia
suspecting anything now,

39:27.741 --> 39:29.743
would we?

39:38.877 --> 39:41.213
You're not supposed
to be back here, Tourmaline.

39:41.254 --> 39:42.974
And you're supposed
to be anywhere, are you?

39:43.006 --> 39:45.717
As I recall, you're the one
who told me to leave her behind.

39:45.759 --> 39:47.594
I never told you
to fake your own death.

39:47.636 --> 39:49.387
I thought
you broke it off clean.

39:49.429 --> 39:51.973
It wasn't that easy,

39:52.015 --> 39:53.934
- and I apologized.
- No, I know.

39:53.975 --> 39:56.853
But one of her new Black Raven
friends saw you two together.

39:56.895 --> 39:58.581
I'm sure you can
imagine how that went over,

39:58.605 --> 39:59.981
her talking to a copper.

40:02.025 --> 40:04.277
- How is she?
- They think she's the one

40:04.319 --> 40:06.363
who's been sharing information
with you lot.

40:06.404 --> 40:08.549
She thinks she can wriggle
her way out of it, as always.

40:08.573 --> 40:09.991
Me?

40:10.033 --> 40:11.493
I think you got her
into this mess,

40:11.535 --> 40:12.619
and you can get her out.

40:12.661 --> 40:14.079
I told her not to join
the Ravens.

40:14.121 --> 40:15.914
Well, she did.

40:15.956 --> 40:18.458
And now I need you to tell me
who is on the take.

40:19.501 --> 40:21.878
Fuck.

40:21.920 --> 40:24.881
It's him or her, Philo.

40:24.923 --> 40:28.093
These Ravens,
they don't fuck about.

40:30.011 --> 40:31.972
Edgal Hamlyn.

40:33.014 --> 40:35.225
Inspector. They found him.

40:35.267 --> 40:36.643
- Who?
- The Breakspear boy.

40:36.685 --> 40:38.270
He's being held
at the Copley Baths.

40:38.311 --> 40:39.688
Don't know how many kidnappers.

40:39.729 --> 40:41.731
Captain wants all hands
on this one.

40:51.032 --> 40:53.410
- Sweep the place!
- Right away, sir!

40:53.451 --> 40:56.454
Whoever's helping Longerbane
might be hiding.

40:57.706 --> 41:00.417
It's okay. You're safe.

41:00.458 --> 41:02.252
- Well?
- They're gone, sir.

41:02.294 --> 41:05.547
Eh, these cunts
will be long gone by now.

41:06.548 --> 41:08.425
Fuck it.

41:19.019 --> 41:20.729
Are you all right, boy?

41:22.397 --> 41:23.732
Did he hurt you?

41:25.734 --> 41:27.235
I knew you'd bring me home.

41:27.277 --> 41:30.155
I would have leveled heaven
itself.

41:30.197 --> 41:32.324
But, in truth,

41:32.365 --> 41:34.743
we've your mother to thank.

41:34.784 --> 41:37.746
It was she who implored me

41:37.787 --> 41:39.956
to consult with her Haruspex.

41:51.551 --> 41:53.511
Jonah.

41:53.553 --> 41:56.806
Thank the Martyr you're safe.

42:12.072 --> 42:14.157
I'd have a word
with your mistress.

42:14.199 --> 42:17.077
She is otherwise disposed,
I'm afraid.

42:17.118 --> 42:18.912
Is that you, Ezra?

42:22.666 --> 42:25.043
What do you want?

42:25.085 --> 42:26.544
I came to apologize,

42:26.586 --> 42:28.421
for my behavior today.

42:30.048 --> 42:32.050
Apology accepted.
Thank you.

42:37.222 --> 42:38.932
What's the matter?

42:38.974 --> 42:40.934
Are they staring?

42:40.976 --> 42:43.603
Wondering what a Puck is doing
at your front door.

42:45.605 --> 42:47.816
Imagine how they'll stare
when you and your brother

42:47.857 --> 42:49.734
are forced to sell this house.

42:50.944 --> 42:52.988
What do you know of our affairs?

42:53.029 --> 42:54.990
Only what your neighbors'
servants are saying

42:55.031 --> 42:57.867
about the trouble your brother's
gotten himself into.

42:57.909 --> 43:00.745
I am sorry.

43:00.787 --> 43:03.331
One can only guess
at your desperation.

43:06.334 --> 43:08.962
It is.

43:09.004 --> 43:10.880
It is desperation.

43:10.922 --> 43:12.716
You are right to call it so.

43:13.842 --> 43:15.552
My brother and I,

43:15.593 --> 43:17.554
we find ourselves drowning

43:17.595 --> 43:20.181
and were never taught to swim.

43:20.223 --> 43:22.934
This is honesty.

43:22.976 --> 43:27.022
My invitation to tea
was not for sport.

43:27.063 --> 43:31.234
I meant to test the waters
of your generosity.

43:32.235 --> 43:34.195
I sensed

43:34.237 --> 43:37.574
that you lack a proper
invitation to society here.

43:37.615 --> 43:40.827
And you smelled a bargain
to be made.

43:40.869 --> 43:42.245
I am sorry, Mr. Agreus.

43:42.287 --> 43:44.080
It was foolish of me.
I see that now.

43:44.122 --> 43:45.165
Was it?

43:45.206 --> 43:46.833
Please don't toy with me.

43:46.875 --> 43:49.502
Far from it.

43:49.544 --> 43:54.132
I see no reason why we
can't come to an accommodation.

43:56.551 --> 43:59.054
The first step, of course...

44:01.348 --> 44:04.768
...you have to let me
through your front door.

44:36.007 --> 44:37.384
Hamlyn.

44:37.425 --> 44:39.386
He knew about the shipment.

44:39.427 --> 44:41.971
That copper of yours
gave you this?

44:42.013 --> 44:45.141
You really must have him wrapped
around your little finger.

44:45.183 --> 44:48.561
Only one thing left to do then.

44:48.603 --> 44:50.563
You want me to do it?

44:50.605 --> 44:54.234
How easy it would be to give me
a name and walk away clean.

44:54.275 --> 44:56.694
No, you need to prove
you believe it.

44:56.736 --> 44:58.196
I'm not a killer.

44:58.238 --> 44:59.989
All those years
in the occupation.

45:00.031 --> 45:02.742
A tough lass like you never left
a single body in her wake?

45:02.784 --> 45:03.993
Not one?

45:04.035 --> 45:05.745
Never my own kind.

45:05.787 --> 45:07.580
What did I tell you?

45:07.622 --> 45:11.960
He who picks the groundlings
belongs to the ground.

45:13.002 --> 45:15.672
Put him in it.

45:22.679 --> 45:25.682
And bring me
the cocksucker's wing.

45:34.899 --> 45:37.026
Oona said you wanted to see me.

45:37.068 --> 45:38.278
I did.

45:38.319 --> 45:39.279
What is it?

45:39.320 --> 45:40.947
I'm very busy tonight.

45:40.989 --> 45:42.615
I've heard something about you,

45:42.657 --> 45:44.200
and I want to know if it's true.

45:44.242 --> 45:45.702
Oh.

45:45.743 --> 45:48.121
What did you hear?

45:48.163 --> 45:52.876
That you've been telling folks
that you mean to fuck me.

45:54.502 --> 45:57.255
These faerishyn say
all kinds of things.

45:58.756 --> 46:01.468
So you wouldn't then?

46:01.509 --> 46:03.845
Wouldn't what?

46:05.263 --> 46:07.265
Fuck me.

46:10.768 --> 46:13.605
Mm, no, I didn't say that.

46:15.607 --> 46:17.817
Close your eyes.

46:17.859 --> 46:20.069
Why?

46:20.111 --> 46:22.780
Because I told you to.

46:26.784 --> 46:30.246
Mm, I'm sure there's a more
comfortable place we can go.

46:30.288 --> 46:32.290
No.

46:35.543 --> 46:38.421
I don't want this
to get too comfortable.

47:47.615 --> 47:51.077
You tender-wings
all come off the boat the same...

47:51.119 --> 47:53.538
thinking you survived
because you're strong.

47:53.580 --> 47:54.956
But you're just lucky.

47:57.458 --> 48:00.461
You really think you're the
first faerishyn to come for me?

48:00.503 --> 48:01.504
Huh?

48:03.548 --> 48:04.632
No.

48:04.674 --> 48:07.885
I will outlive you, lady's maid.

48:07.927 --> 48:10.054
And you will spend
your last breath wishing

48:10.096 --> 48:11.472
you'd just followed through

48:11.514 --> 48:14.309
and sucked me off.

48:14.350 --> 48:17.520
Because now
you really got me worked up.

48:17.562 --> 48:19.397
And I'm keen to see

48:19.439 --> 48:21.983
just how slowly
I can cut off your pretty head.

48:23.359 --> 48:24.569
Too slow.

48:31.451 --> 48:33.828
Are you okay?

48:39.125 --> 48:40.793
Vignette.

48:43.671 --> 48:46.049
We have to go.

48:46.090 --> 48:48.468
How did you find me?

48:48.509 --> 48:49.636
Tourmaline.

48:49.677 --> 48:50.720
Oh, God.

48:52.847 --> 48:55.475
Help me with the body.

49:09.030 --> 49:10.740
Where's it lead?

49:12.367 --> 49:14.994
To the river, then out to sea.

49:15.036 --> 49:17.580
What if he turns up?

49:17.622 --> 49:20.249
They'll find a constabulary
bullet in him and let it go,

49:20.291 --> 49:22.001
I suppose.

49:22.043 --> 49:24.253
Is that how it works
around here?

49:25.546 --> 49:26.923
The Burgue

49:26.964 --> 49:30.093
is an ugly place.

49:30.134 --> 49:33.388
It's the home you chose.

49:38.393 --> 49:41.020
It wasn't right,
the way I left you.

49:43.064 --> 49:46.025
I kept trying
to tell myself it was.

49:46.067 --> 49:48.027
At the end of the day,

49:48.069 --> 49:52.365
a man's no better than the pain
he's caused the people he loves

49:52.407 --> 49:55.743
and what he's willing to do
to set it right.

50:05.420 --> 50:08.256
I should never have taken it
from you.

50:11.759 --> 50:13.761
I'm sorry.

50:30.737 --> 50:31.946
I'll be honest...

50:31.988 --> 50:33.865
I didn't know which one of you
would come back.

50:33.906 --> 50:35.283
Me neither.

50:35.324 --> 50:36.701
Quick and painless?

50:36.743 --> 50:37.702
No.

50:37.744 --> 50:39.245
Good.

50:43.040 --> 50:44.333
What's this?

50:44.375 --> 50:45.668
A promotion.

50:45.710 --> 50:47.253
Hamlyn ran the lots.

50:47.295 --> 50:48.838
Now you do.

50:48.880 --> 50:52.008
I'm giving you
the Finistere route.

50:52.049 --> 50:54.469
Off you go.

50:56.095 --> 50:57.054
Oh.

50:57.096 --> 51:00.057
Be careful
with that copper of yours.

51:00.099 --> 51:02.727
Or, next time,
it'll be your wing on the table.

51:04.020 --> 51:07.440
You don't have to worry
about him.

51:25.541 --> 51:27.752
You got my note.

51:27.794 --> 51:29.837
And came anyway.

51:32.173 --> 51:34.050
Portia,

51:34.091 --> 51:36.844
I do care about you.

51:37.845 --> 51:40.056
More than I've shown.

51:40.097 --> 51:42.767
You deserve better.

51:44.936 --> 51:47.772
What brings this on, Philo?

51:50.441 --> 51:53.736
I've decided to choose a world.

51:53.778 --> 51:56.322
What's that supposed to mean?

51:57.365 --> 51:59.492
It occurred to me

51:59.534 --> 52:02.745
I've never taken you out.

52:13.089 --> 52:16.509
Can't think of the last time
someone served me dinner.

52:16.551 --> 52:21.097
Can't think of anyone
who deserves it more.

52:23.140 --> 52:25.518
This is nice.

52:25.560 --> 52:27.687
Thank you for bringing me.

52:37.321 --> 52:38.698
It was me.

52:38.739 --> 52:40.157
Sorry?

52:40.199 --> 52:43.911
That girl you asked me about
the other day.

52:43.953 --> 52:47.665
It was me who hurt her.

52:49.709 --> 52:53.170
Sometimes that's harder
to live with

52:53.212 --> 52:55.339
than the other way around.

53:32.376 --> 53:34.378
Have you been here all night?

53:38.466 --> 53:40.217
You okay?

53:44.305 --> 53:46.807
Vignette...

53:52.521 --> 53:54.315
It's okay, it's okay.

53:54.357 --> 53:56.442
Okay. All right.

53:56.484 --> 53:58.819
You're okay.
