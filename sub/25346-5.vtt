[Karamo] This is his top surgery.

00:43.501 --> 00:45.378
When we say top surgery,

00:45.462 --> 00:47.297
-we mean to get rid of breasts?
-Yes.

00:47.380 --> 00:48.339
[whistles]

00:54.888 --> 00:57.849
[Skyler]
I was born and identified as a woman.

00:58.266 --> 01:02.353
But since I was in preschool,
I've known that that just wasn't me.

01:02.812 --> 01:05.523
I remember when I was 12,
standing in a mirror

01:06.024 --> 01:09.569
and contorting my body in ways
to be more masculine.

01:10.153 --> 01:14.032
Thinking, "I'm gonna get a surgery
that makes me look like this."

01:27.587 --> 01:29.506
[woman] We've finished your surgery.

01:29.589 --> 01:31.132
Wanna take a look quickly?

01:40.350 --> 01:41.559
[all] Aw...

01:42.936 --> 01:45.480
[Karamo] He just looked down
for the first time.

01:47.607 --> 01:48.441
Okay?

01:49.776 --> 01:51.111
[chuckles]

01:53.488 --> 01:54.656
Wow.

01:54.739 --> 01:59.160
We all struggle with the realization
we were different than everyone else.

01:59.244 --> 02:01.996
I can only imagine
how hard it was to realize

02:02.080 --> 02:05.917
you weren't born with the right body.
He was able to come to that realization

02:06.000 --> 02:08.211
and take the steps
to become who he is.

02:08.586 --> 02:10.630
He's an inspiration.

02:13.133 --> 02:14.175
[groans]

[Karamo]
So many gay men, lesbian, bisexual people,

02:48.251 --> 02:51.087
we don't know truly
what the trans experience is.

02:51.170 --> 02:54.382
We support them but
we don't know everything they go through.

02:54.465 --> 02:57.802
I think that, probably,
most straight people assume that,

02:57.886 --> 03:01.973
because it's LGBTQ, we must
all understand each other's plight.

03:02.473 --> 03:04.142
That couldn't be more wrong.

03:07.395 --> 03:09.480

I'm interested to meet a trans person
to understand their story.

03:14.527 --> 03:17.405
All right,
so I got some more info on Skyler.

03:17.488 --> 03:20.950
As we know Skyler is a transgendered man
who was raised as a female.

03:21.743 --> 03:23.745
Spent most of his life feeling one way,

03:23.828 --> 03:25.955
having the world see him
as something else.

03:26.039 --> 03:29.083
[Skyler] I came to college,
I started doing drag, gave myself

03:29.167 --> 03:33.630
that safe space to explore my gender.
Over a couple of years, I figured out

03:33.713 --> 03:36.132
I didn't wanna be a man
on-stage in drag,

03:36.216 --> 03:38.927
I wanted to be seen
as a man all the time.

03:39.010 --> 03:42.347
-And I eventually had to commit.
-Yeah.

03:42.430 --> 03:45.475
For the last eight years,
Skyler has used most of his money

03:45.558 --> 03:48.811
and energy preparing for top surgery.
He got it six weeks ago.

03:49.395 --> 03:52.982
It definitely drove a big wedge

03:53.066 --> 03:54.359
in my family.

03:54.609 --> 03:59.280
They came to a point where they thought
that I needed to be put away,

03:59.364 --> 04:03.034
that I was insane for thinking
that I could ever be a man.

04:03.117 --> 04:05.828
And that was really hard

04:06.371 --> 04:10.833
to have my mom and my dad say
those type of hurtful things to me.

04:10.917 --> 04:14.879
I had to cut ties with them, and
that was a decision I had to make.

04:14.963 --> 04:18.633
It was very difficult
but it was the right decision for me.

04:19.342 --> 04:23.054
Skyler is excited to start the next
chapter of his life but he needs help.

04:23.137 --> 04:26.432
I think from this experience,
Skyler needs confidence

04:26.516 --> 04:29.602
in his new identity
and to have somebody say:

04:29.686 --> 04:33.815
"We're gonna make you the best you
you can be, and you do belong."

04:33.898 --> 04:35.900
That could change everything.

04:36.192 --> 04:37.610
Up until very recently,

04:37.694 --> 04:39.654
my sole focus was top surgery.

04:39.737 --> 04:43.658
Now that I have that burden
lifted off of me, I actually can think

04:43.741 --> 04:47.453
about the ways that spending time
with these guys could benefit me.

04:47.537 --> 04:48.788
It's really exciting.

04:48.871 --> 04:50.581
Skyler has always worn clothes

04:50.665 --> 04:53.543
that do not fit his body
to hide his curves

04:53.626 --> 04:55.128
he wasn't comfortable with.

04:55.211 --> 04:57.630
But he also loves to stand out
in the crowd.

04:58.298 --> 05:01.467
Skyler is a ginger,
and his hair and beard define him.

05:01.551 --> 05:03.636
-I want us to unpack that a bit.
-Yeah.

05:04.137 --> 05:07.682
My beard has taken two to three years
to fully grow in.

05:07.765 --> 05:10.476
Being a transgender man,
no one taught me how to shave.

05:10.810 --> 05:13.604
I didn't have a dad or an older brother

05:13.688 --> 05:17.233
that was gonna show me
how to do it and not hurt myself.

05:17.317 --> 05:20.278
Skyler has an open-door policy
and loves having people over.

05:20.486 --> 05:23.114
He takes in a lot of people
who have been displaced.

05:23.197 --> 05:26.451
His friends in the LGBTQ community
helped him fundraise

05:26.534 --> 05:28.536
over 8 grand for his top surgery.

05:28.619 --> 05:29.996
That's what we do.

05:30.455 --> 05:32.749
He wants to say
thank you to all his friends

05:32.832 --> 05:36.335
for helping him out. He wants
to throw a big event this weekend.

05:36.419 --> 05:38.963
-What a champion.
-Guys, our mission this week,

05:39.047 --> 05:41.674
it's to help Skyler

-Yeah.
-Sounds great.

05:43.051 --> 05:44.510
I'm down for that.

-Open up.
-We're here.

-Thanks. It's a little lace.

06:14.999 --> 06:17.418

in their early 20s,

06:17.502 --> 06:20.379
and everything is about being part
of the queer community.

06:20.463 --> 06:24.050

-It's a good centerpiece.

-I know.

06:43.569 --> 06:46.072
-It's a full cat pee couch?
-[Skyler] I know.

06:46.739 --> 06:47.740
I'm kitty.

06:47.824 --> 06:49.826
Once they start,
they only pee on it.

06:49.909 --> 06:52.245
This is the most disgusting thing
ever.

07:04.757 --> 07:08.553
Tell me about his, uh, style.

07:09.053 --> 07:12.849
That's one thing
that he is really, like, on top of.

07:12.932 --> 07:14.809
He's a very fashionable man.

07:14.892 --> 07:18.604
-They come to me for advice.
-[Tan] I don't wanna be judgmental,

07:18.688 --> 07:22.108
but on a personal note,
his outfit is wack.

07:22.191 --> 07:24.444
Skyler is 30,

07:24.527 --> 07:28.489
and he's dressed like a skater boy
from, like, 1995.

07:28.739 --> 07:30.324
[Bobby] That's a lot of hats.

07:30.992 --> 07:33.536
Hats are great
on the head but not the wall.

07:33.619 --> 07:36.289
-How would you store them?
-I'm gonna figure that out.

07:36.998 --> 07:38.124
[Antoni] Oh, my.

07:38.583 --> 07:41.461
-Shiny.
-[Jonathan] There is love on these sheets.

07:41.544 --> 07:43.963
This bed looks
like it came out of a dorm.

07:44.046 --> 07:48.134
I need a high bed to store
my second persona underneath it.

07:48.217 --> 07:50.386
-[Tan] Do you wear these shoes?
-A bit.

07:50.470 --> 07:52.930
-[Jonathan] I like those.
-[Tan] The kooky ones

07:53.014 --> 07:55.683
-The other ones are--
-Those are work shoes.

07:55.766 --> 07:59.645
I work at, um, the University of Georgia,
I'm in Events Management.

07:59.729 --> 08:01.981
-[Karamo] Can I ask a question?
-[Skyler] Yes.

08:02.064 --> 08:04.817
You just got out of surgery,
how are you doing?

08:04.901 --> 08:07.695
We're pushing you around,
taking you there, how are you?

08:07.778 --> 08:08.946
I'm doing okay.

08:09.030 --> 08:12.825
This is only the second
time I've worn a tank top post-op,

08:12.909 --> 08:15.453
I can only wear a button-up
so I can't--

08:15.828 --> 08:19.415
That's my range. I can't lift
my arms higher right now.

08:19.499 --> 08:22.668
-When we saw your surgery--
-[Skyler] You guys got to see that?

08:22.752 --> 08:25.296
To see the look in your eyes
when you looked down.

08:25.379 --> 08:26.672
-Yeah.
-Oh, my gosh.

08:26.756 --> 08:29.759
I don't remember a lot of it
because of my complications.

08:29.842 --> 08:32.261
I had a bad reaction
to the anesthesia,

08:32.512 --> 08:35.765
um, which is apparently
really common for redheads.

08:35.848 --> 08:37.183
What?

08:37.266 --> 08:40.895
The MC1R gene in redheads makes you
crazy susceptible

08:40.978 --> 08:43.022
to anesthesias and narcotics.

08:43.105 --> 08:47.318
Um, so, when they put me under,
um, several of my organs shut down.

08:47.401 --> 08:51.197
I have to have another procedure
to address the internal bleeding.

08:51.280 --> 08:54.742
More money? I know you raised
the initial money from the community.

08:54.825 --> 08:55.910
Are you gonna--?

08:55.993 --> 08:59.872

$200,000 hospital bill

08:59.956 --> 09:02.333
in complications for the next year.

09:02.583 --> 09:05.836
So, it really sucks
but I wouldn't change it.

09:06.796 --> 09:09.715
When you see how difficult
his journey has been

09:10.174 --> 09:14.095
but how gracefully he carries himself,
it's inspiring and it's uplifting.

09:14.512 --> 09:15.763
So, how do you feel?

09:16.180 --> 09:17.098
Here we are.

09:18.057 --> 09:20.643
The week is here.
So, how are you feeling?

09:20.935 --> 09:23.437
-I'm excited.
-What's your experience with shaving?

09:23.521 --> 09:25.273
I was never really taught.

09:25.356 --> 09:26.357
Yeah.

09:26.440 --> 09:29.360
I went through my second puberty
in my mid-20s.

09:29.443 --> 09:31.153
-Do you get hair here?
-Yes.

09:31.487 --> 09:33.155
-We get all down here.
-Uh-huh.

09:33.239 --> 09:35.575
-It comes all the way down to here.
-Got it.

09:36.117 --> 09:37.952
I really shy away from imparting

09:38.035 --> 09:40.371
what I believe has
to happen on someone's look.

09:40.454 --> 09:42.123
I like it to be a collaboration,

09:42.206 --> 09:45.126
what does it look
like for you in the morning?

09:45.209 --> 09:48.045
I'm here to help you
be the best you that you can be,

09:48.129 --> 09:51.048
comma, I don't want you to look
like a leprechaun.

09:51.132 --> 09:52.133
We gotta change it.

09:52.550 --> 09:54.051
[Karamo] I'm noticing a theme.

09:54.176 --> 09:58.472
It's like you've kind of been stuck
in, like, "I'm 19, 20 years old."

09:58.556 --> 10:01.058
That's one of the things I struggle with,

10:01.142 --> 10:04.270
that forever young kind of, like,
Peter Pan syndrome,

10:04.353 --> 10:05.479
for sure.

10:05.563 --> 10:09.233
Uh, there's three fictional characters
that describe you,

10:09.317 --> 10:12.778
and Peter Pan is one of them for me
that I always use.

10:12.862 --> 10:14.905
Who would you want
to replace that with?

10:14.989 --> 10:17.950
It would be Todrick.
But he's not fictional.

10:18.034 --> 10:19.744
I love Todrick.

10:19.827 --> 10:21.912
His fashion,
performance, his music.

10:21.996 --> 10:23.789
I'm inspired by everything he does.

10:25.041 --> 10:27.835
When you open up tomato sauce,
you gotta eat it quickly.

10:28.461 --> 10:30.087
[groaning]

10:30.171 --> 10:31.130
That's no bueno.

10:31.213 --> 10:35.134
I commend you for being in a place
where you can take care of others.

10:35.217 --> 10:36.927
How do you find time for yourself?

10:38.262 --> 10:39.263
That's very hard.

10:39.347 --> 10:42.475
Is there anything on your mind
you know you wanna do?

10:42.558 --> 10:44.727
One of the most important things

10:44.810 --> 10:48.022
for me right now, um, is my gender marker.

10:48.314 --> 10:51.067
-It is still female on my license.
-Mm-hm.

10:51.150 --> 10:53.444
Um, and now that I'm actually post-op,

10:53.694 --> 10:57.740
um, I have all of the documents
I need to be able to go to the DMV

10:57.823 --> 11:01.243
and get that taken care of,
get my gender marker changed.

11:01.327 --> 11:03.162
This is what I'm talking about.

11:03.871 --> 11:05.998
Most of us take our IDs for granted.

11:06.082 --> 11:10.211
We got it when we were 15 or 16,
and we never think about it.

11:10.294 --> 11:14.882
But all he wants is to just experience
the same life that we all experience.

11:15.216 --> 11:17.760
This one little thing
is holding him back.

11:18.344 --> 11:20.679
Can you show me
what's going on here?

11:20.763 --> 11:22.556
We each have our own pantry.

11:22.640 --> 11:25.643
-This one is mine, the most overflowing.
-[Antoni] Uh-huh.

11:26.352 --> 11:27.978
-Yeah.
-Um, like crazy.

11:28.062 --> 11:29.939
This could use some organization.

11:30.022 --> 11:32.358
There's not that much garbage food.

11:32.441 --> 11:35.945
Like, you eat pretty healthy-ish.
What's your indulgence?

11:36.028 --> 11:37.988
-Something that feels good--
-Sushi.

11:38.072 --> 11:40.199
-Sushi?
-Sushi is my favorite food.

11:40.282 --> 11:42.785
-I never can make that at the house.
-Got you.

11:42.868 --> 11:46.080
In a perfect world, how would you see
this space working for you?

11:46.163 --> 11:49.500
-Obviously, lots of seating for family.
-Yes. Yeah.

11:49.583 --> 11:51.377
Lots of seating, comfortable.

11:51.460 --> 11:54.213
I like that this is a space, too,

11:54.296 --> 11:58.008
where the second people walk in,
even if they're not my friends,

11:58.092 --> 12:00.761
they know they're stepping
into a queer space.

12:00.845 --> 12:03.931
I want Skyler to realize
that queer is just a column,

12:04.140 --> 12:07.268
a column
that holds up the house of Skyler.

12:07.351 --> 12:09.437
Yes, he needs to be proud.

12:09.645 --> 12:13.149
But flags are to be flown,
they're not décor.

12:14.150 --> 12:17.361
-This is a much younger person's look.
-[chuckles]

12:17.445 --> 12:19.697
-People think I'm early 20s.
-Teenager.

12:19.780 --> 12:21.532
And it's my look and my look.

12:21.615 --> 12:23.367
Yes. I want you to look like

12:23.451 --> 12:26.245
a 30-something-year-old man
who's ready to move forward.

12:26.328 --> 12:29.790
I have noticed
that your stuff is kind of androgynous.

12:29.874 --> 12:34.336
Yes. I actually made that to wear to
Todrick's, um, Straight Outta Oz concert.

12:34.420 --> 12:36.505
I'm the worst gay of them all.

12:36.589 --> 12:39.425
And I don't even know
who this Todrick person is.

12:39.508 --> 12:42.386
Todrick Hall is a YouTube star.
Very openly gay.

12:42.845 --> 12:44.889
I'm inspired by his music, his style.

12:44.972 --> 12:48.559
He likes playing with fashion and
femininity. Your top is feminine.

12:48.642 --> 12:51.103
-I like it.
-Super feminine. Thank you so much.

12:51.353 --> 12:53.063
Until now, I've been intimidated,

12:53.147 --> 12:57.443
thinking I don't know what I'm gonna put
him in, I want him to feel like a dude.

12:57.651 --> 12:59.361
Now, I couldn't care less.

12:59.445 --> 13:02.907
I'm gonna find out who
this Todrick person is and we'll try--

13:02.990 --> 13:04.700
Look at his red carpet looks.

13:04.783 --> 13:07.745
He plays with masculine,
and feminine, I love that.

13:07.828 --> 13:10.581
He's not confined
to any genre of clothing.

13:10.789 --> 13:14.043
This gives me an opportunity
to play like never before.

13:14.126 --> 13:17.046
I just wanna make sure he feels great
as Skyler.

13:17.129 --> 13:19.965
-You've got so many ties.
-Yes.

13:20.049 --> 13:22.718
A lot of those need to go,
they have stains--

13:22.801 --> 13:25.679
-Almost all are gonna go.
-I have to wear those at work.

13:25.763 --> 13:29.266
-You wear a tie to work?
-Yes. I bought two suits

13:29.350 --> 13:32.102
-that are hanging there.
-I did notice.

13:32.186 --> 13:36.315
When they were trying to tailor
them, I got, like, super uncomfortable

13:36.607 --> 13:38.400
and just kind of panicked and left,

13:38.692 --> 13:41.153
um, because they were getting all up
in my pants

13:41.237 --> 13:43.489
-and in areas and, like, you know.
-Oh...

13:43.572 --> 13:45.699
That's a safety issue for me.

13:45.783 --> 13:48.911
So I've had those
since Christmas and never worn them.

13:48.994 --> 13:49.912
Okay.

13:49.995 --> 13:52.498
I don't know
what they would need to be sized for.

13:52.581 --> 13:56.919
Nothing makes me feel like more
of a guy than when I'm in a suit.

13:57.127 --> 13:58.629
-Okay. Mm-hm.
-A good suit.

13:58.712 --> 14:01.549
That's the height
of sophistication for a man.

14:01.799 --> 14:04.760
So, I kind of wanna find a way to get you
in a suit

14:04.843 --> 14:07.346
-that makes complete sense for you.
-Okay.

14:07.429 --> 14:10.683
I will get you fun options
but let's get the basics down.

14:10.766 --> 14:13.185
-The basics of a man's wardrobe is a suit.
-Yeah.

14:13.811 --> 14:15.729
-Yeah?
-I agree with you on that.

14:16.021 --> 14:17.398
Okay, good. Good.

14:17.481 --> 14:18.566
[meows]

14:18.649 --> 14:21.068
You have an event coming up.
Tell us about it?

14:21.151 --> 14:24.905
Yes. I am six weeks out post-op
from top surgery today.

14:24.989 --> 14:27.741
-Um, so, that's really exciting.
-Yes.

14:27.992 --> 14:31.078
Um, so, we're gonna go to MSR,

14:31.328 --> 14:33.747
um, which is, like, my home-based bar
in Atlanta.

14:33.831 --> 14:36.458
These are the people that helped me...

14:37.626 --> 14:39.253
change my life.

14:39.837 --> 14:43.382
You know, without all of them
kind of rallying behind me

14:43.465 --> 14:47.136
over the last few months, I wouldn't
have been able to get my top surgery.

14:47.845 --> 14:50.472
On Friday,
I just wanna be able to be visible

14:50.556 --> 14:53.934
and be present and let everybody know
that I'm okay, I'm alive.

14:54.018 --> 14:57.396
And I'm thankful
for all that they've done to me,

14:57.479 --> 14:59.565
help me meet this huge financial goal

14:59.648 --> 15:01.609
that I wouldn't have been able to meet.

15:01.692 --> 15:04.194
[Bobby] Will this be the first time
you've been out

15:04.278 --> 15:06.447
-after your top surgery?
-Mm-hm.

15:06.530 --> 15:08.032
-Yeah.
-[Bobby] Powerful night.

-Yeah. For sure.

[Bobby] What Skyler needs help with
is learning to edit.

15:33.807 --> 15:36.936
Edit things out of the closet
he doesn't need daily.

15:37.019 --> 15:40.314
Learn to utilize his space,
to make his life easier.

15:40.397 --> 15:44.318
Every man I know wants a great suit.
The fact that his experience was so bad

15:44.401 --> 15:47.112
when he went
to get his suit tailored is horrible.

15:47.196 --> 15:50.282
However,
I've found a way to get a suit for Skyler

15:50.366 --> 15:52.868
that I think he's gonna be so happy with.

15:52.952 --> 15:55.454
And I am so excited to tell him about it.

15:55.537 --> 15:57.539
There are things that Skyler has put off

15:57.623 --> 16:00.167
because he's been focused
on getting his surgery.

16:00.250 --> 16:03.504
But he hasn't taken the time
to change his gender marker

16:03.587 --> 16:04.588
on his license.

16:04.672 --> 16:08.217
And that's something he needs
to handle immediately.

16:08.300 --> 16:10.719
Transformation Tuesday is upon us.

16:10.803 --> 16:15.057
He's serving man. He's man-shaped.
His face is very manly.

16:15.140 --> 16:18.644
Except when you put a dark shadowy color
on your jawbone

16:18.727 --> 16:22.147
but nothing on your cheeks or your neck,
it recedes the jaw

16:22.231 --> 16:23.899
and makes it appear smaller.

16:23.983 --> 16:27.528
And makes your Mitch McConnell
neck and cheeks seem bigger.

16:27.611 --> 16:29.571
So, the facial hair has to go.

16:31.281 --> 16:32.825
[pop music playing]

16:38.831 --> 16:40.082
When did you leave home?

16:40.165 --> 16:41.250
When I was 17.

16:41.333 --> 16:43.877
So, just before the end of high school.

16:43.961 --> 16:47.715
In my senior year, I got outed at school
and everything changed.

16:47.798 --> 16:50.968
I was having a really hard time.
I got into alcohol

16:51.260 --> 16:53.637
and started doing stuff
that I shouldn't.

16:53.721 --> 16:56.265
One of my friends was living
with us.

16:56.348 --> 16:57.975
She had her own issues at home.

16:58.058 --> 17:00.769
My mom freaked and was like,
"Your friend has to leave,

17:00.853 --> 17:02.563
your friend's a bad influence."

17:02.646 --> 17:05.691
But my friend was the only one
who knew what was going on.

17:05.774 --> 17:07.943
I was like,
"She has nothing to do with it."

17:08.027 --> 17:10.696
And so,
in a screaming match about all this,

17:10.779 --> 17:13.574
she was like, "Give me a reason,
what's wrong with you."

17:13.657 --> 17:15.325
I was like, "I'm gay. I'm gay.

17:15.409 --> 17:19.997
And, like, everyone is making
my life frigging miserable now at school."

17:21.290 --> 17:23.208
And my mom just kind of lost it.

17:23.292 --> 17:26.295
And instead of making my friend go,
I did instead.

17:26.378 --> 17:27.713
-Um...
-Wow.

17:28.255 --> 17:30.966
I've been down this road before,
worried about my past,

17:31.050 --> 17:33.218
worried about the people in my past.

17:33.302 --> 17:37.473
One day, I just had to realize who cares
if your past doesn't come along with you.

17:37.890 --> 17:40.517
You only need your present
and your future.

17:41.268 --> 17:43.062
Skyler's future is bright.

17:43.562 --> 17:45.814
I was outed at 16. I left at 15.

17:45.898 --> 17:49.109
l left, actually,
before my family knew I was gay.

17:49.193 --> 17:50.027
-Yeah.
-Um...

17:50.110 --> 17:52.196
-I was always a really angry kid
-Mm-hm.

17:52.488 --> 17:54.823
because every day of my life,
I wore a mask.

17:54.907 --> 17:57.326
So, when you're hearing constantly

17:57.409 --> 18:00.037
from the people
that mean the most to you

18:00.120 --> 18:02.831
-that what you are is awful--
-You're awful.

18:03.082 --> 18:04.917
Yeah, and unacceptable.

18:05.000 --> 18:07.461
-It really does a number on you.
-Yeah.

18:07.544 --> 18:10.714
-So, I was just pissed all the time.
-Yeah.

18:11.590 --> 18:14.551
Skyler and I both have the same connection
of rejection

18:14.635 --> 18:16.470
from family, from friends.

18:16.887 --> 18:20.015
And that can be a hard thing to heal from.

18:21.100 --> 18:23.435
How did you get over that damage?

18:23.519 --> 18:27.147
Know how to forgive them for that?
I don't know if it's possible.

18:27.231 --> 18:29.983
It takes your chosen family,
like you have,

18:30.818 --> 18:33.612
that loves you
and accepts you for who you are.

18:33.987 --> 18:36.824
And it helps you to then accept yourself.

18:38.200 --> 18:41.286
Are you excited to give some stuff away?

18:41.411 --> 18:43.413
Yes, I am super excited.

18:43.747 --> 18:46.458
-All right. Let's get down there.
-Let's do it.

18:46.542 --> 18:49.169
Skyler spent
his entire adult life fighting

18:49.253 --> 18:51.296

You guys keep up the good work.

18:57.803 --> 19:00.722
And I can definitely tell that
giving back to the community

They specialize in suits.

19:42.973 --> 19:46.310

for the trans community.

19:46.393 --> 19:47.978
Really? That's super cool.

19:48.061 --> 19:52.691
Our ethos is to serve everyone. And we've
made a safe place for a lot of people

19:52.774 --> 19:54.193
from the trans community

19:54.276 --> 19:59.239

We're here to help.

20:02.993 --> 20:05.204
He just bought this in for us today.

20:05.287 --> 20:08.498
-Okay, that's nice. Yeah.
-This is your suit.

20:08.582 --> 20:10.334
-That's nice.
-We wanted fabric

20:10.626 --> 20:13.462
that is classic.
The finishings are gorgeous.

20:13.545 --> 20:16.048
-[Skyler] Yeah, I like that a lot.
-[Tan] Yeah.

Let's get you in this,
we want to see you in it.

20:20.761 --> 20:24.765
A lot of our trans male clientele come
and say I need a men's suit.

20:24.848 --> 20:27.935
So, what we do is
we bind the chest tighter.

20:28.018 --> 20:31.605
We give more room in the true waist
to reduce the skirting effect.

20:31.772 --> 20:35.692
We make the hips in the jacket about
two inches smaller than the hipbone.

20:35.776 --> 20:36.902
It straightens it out.

20:36.985 --> 20:40.614
I never would have realized those
tiny tweaks make such a difference.

20:40.864 --> 20:43.033
People think it's rocket science,
it's not.

20:43.116 --> 20:45.744

-Yeah.

20:55.295 --> 20:56.964
-It makes me so happy.
-Yeah.

20:57.047 --> 20:59.216
This being, like, the first time

20:59.299 --> 21:02.135
I've really tried on clothes
since surgery.

21:03.095 --> 21:05.305
I did lipo around my belt line

21:05.389 --> 21:08.892
because I was self-conscious
about how wide my hips were.

21:08.976 --> 21:10.852
And I was not very broad up top.

21:10.936 --> 21:14.273
And now I look like this.
And that's what I want.

21:14.356 --> 21:17.192
And the suit is showing that
and that's exciting.

21:17.276 --> 21:18.568
Get your body back.

21:18.652 --> 21:22.155
It's the first time I've seen that
so that's why I can't stop smiling.

21:22.239 --> 21:23.824
-Good.
-Yeah.

21:24.408 --> 21:26.994
I love it. Thank you, good job. Yes.

21:27.077 --> 21:29.037
I want one, too. Thank you.

21:30.205 --> 21:32.374
I don't wanna take it off.

21:32.457 --> 21:34.793
You seem hesitant to take it off,
which I love.

21:34.876 --> 21:36.795
No, that's exactly what we want.

21:36.878 --> 21:38.130
-Hang it for me.
-Okay.

21:38.213 --> 21:40.465
Then Daniel
can make these alterations.

21:40.549 --> 21:41.967
[Skyler] Yeah, of course.

21:42.551 --> 21:44.094
-Thank you.
-My pleasure.

21:44.177 --> 21:46.013
It looks fantastic.

21:48.432 --> 21:51.601
When you looked in that mirror,
did you feel the way you wanted?

21:51.685 --> 21:53.061
I felt like there I was.

21:53.145 --> 21:56.523
Right there.
And I've not been able to look at myself

21:57.482 --> 22:01.236
in a mirror in a suit
and ever say that, ever.

22:02.321 --> 22:04.364
Good. That makes me so happy.

22:04.448 --> 22:05.282
Okay.

22:06.199 --> 22:09.453
I'm hoping this is a safe space
and I can ask you whatever I want.

22:09.536 --> 22:14.041
Honestly, I hate to admit it,
but I'm not immersed in the gay community.

22:14.124 --> 22:15.751
Therefore, I'm ignorant.

22:15.834 --> 22:18.462
I don't know the correct pronouns.
And how--?

22:18.545 --> 22:21.631
How would you feel
if I were to get that wrong?

22:22.632 --> 22:24.051
It does still happen.

22:24.134 --> 22:26.386
I get female pronoun-ed
with the full beard.

22:26.470 --> 22:28.430
That was one of the things, actually...

22:29.473 --> 22:33.310
that was the crappiest part
about my hospital experience,

22:33.560 --> 22:36.146
um, because my gender marker
wasn't changed yet.

22:36.229 --> 22:37.981
So, like, on their charts,

22:38.148 --> 22:42.194
they're reading female, seeing female,
the doctors, nurses, everybody walking in.

22:42.277 --> 22:45.072
And despite the fact
that I have a full beard,

22:45.155 --> 22:48.950
and I'm topless, like,
completely like bare chest and no chest.

22:49.409 --> 22:53.455
And they still wanna call me "she" and
"her" and stuff like that.

22:54.831 --> 22:56.583
And it hurts.

22:57.542 --> 23:01.797
Like, God, I spent almost a decade
of my life being miserable in my body.

23:01.880 --> 23:02.964
Just miserable.

23:03.131 --> 23:06.635
The way it affected me in
the way I interacted with people--

23:06.718 --> 23:09.930
I haven't even felt
comfortable giving hugs in a decade

23:10.013 --> 23:14.351
because I feel people touch my chest
and it makes me so uncomfortable.

23:15.018 --> 23:17.270
I, uh... I feel...

23:18.605 --> 23:20.565
frigging stupid, quite honestly.

23:20.649 --> 23:24.319
I appreciate you trying
to educate yourself, it means a lot.

23:24.528 --> 23:25.987
No, I feel stupid.

23:26.071 --> 23:29.783
I've always looked at trans people
and I've thought,

23:30.325 --> 23:31.493
"Why don't you just--?

23:31.576 --> 23:34.079
It costs so much
and it can be really painful.

23:34.538 --> 23:38.959
Why put yourself through that?
It seems such a traumatic experience."

23:39.042 --> 23:40.127
It's a lot.

23:40.210 --> 23:41.878
I truly didn't understand

23:42.420 --> 23:45.924
what that meant to actually
have the surgery done and feel--

23:46.800 --> 23:48.343
And feel that change.

23:48.426 --> 23:50.720
And when I saw the video of you

23:50.929 --> 23:54.474
when you woke up, I don't really
think you were coherent at the time.

23:54.558 --> 23:57.102
-I don't remember it.
-I don't think you were.

23:57.978 --> 23:59.938
But that shows
how frigging raw it was

24:00.021 --> 24:02.482
when you opened your eyes
and looked down

24:02.566 --> 24:06.069
and you go to reach for your chest.

24:06.570 --> 24:07.445
Um...

24:08.780 --> 24:11.908
That changed it for me. I thought,
"Oh, this is what it means."

24:11.992 --> 24:12.826
Yeah.

24:13.201 --> 24:14.035
Um...

24:14.786 --> 24:17.497
I'm annoyed at myself,
"Why didn't you get involved?

24:17.581 --> 24:22.252
You would have then
understood maybe the trans community."

24:22.335 --> 24:25.964
There are so many people
out there like me, who are ignorant,

24:26.256 --> 24:27.716
who don't understand.

24:27.799 --> 24:30.552
I always felt for the plight
of trans people.

24:30.635 --> 24:34.639
However,
I always thought, "Is it necessary for you

24:34.890 --> 24:38.226
to have this top surgery,
for you to feel like a man?"

24:38.310 --> 24:39.436
For Skyler it was.

24:39.519 --> 24:43.356
The fact I didn't understand that
beforehand makes me feel silly.

24:43.648 --> 24:46.109
This really has helped, truly.

24:48.820 --> 24:52.490
How are you feeling about
getting your license changed?

24:52.574 --> 24:54.701
I'm incredibly excited

24:54.784 --> 24:56.703
but also nervous.

24:56.786 --> 24:59.456
This is my second go
trying to get my marker changed.

24:59.539 --> 25:00.916
-Really?
-Mm-hm.

25:01.291 --> 25:02.792
They would not change it,

25:02.876 --> 25:06.296
they were adamant
about needing to have a surgery letter.

25:06.838 --> 25:09.966
Then the woman said something to me
along the lines of,

25:10.050 --> 25:13.887
"I'm not gonna do this,
come back when you're complete."

25:14.387 --> 25:15.639
-What the hell?
-Yeah.

25:15.931 --> 25:21.478
It's heartbreaking because all he wants is
for the gender on his license

25:21.561 --> 25:24.397
to match the person he is
and the person we see.

25:24.481 --> 25:27.776
I'm gonna be walking out
with a male license today.

25:27.859 --> 25:28.860
Hundred percent.

25:29.361 --> 25:31.696
We're talking about a driver's license,

25:31.780 --> 25:34.741
but this is such
a life-changing moment for Skyler.

25:38.954 --> 25:42.749
The decision that is made
is gonna affect Skyler in ways

25:42.832 --> 25:45.919
that we take for granted every single day.

25:47.003 --> 25:49.172
-You said gender change?
-Yes, ma'am.

25:49.256 --> 25:51.758
So, I've got my social.

25:52.300 --> 25:57.305
A single card that is basically
your pass to get a job,

25:57.389 --> 26:00.475
go into a bar, get on a flight.

26:00.558 --> 26:02.894
[Skyler] So, I've got my birth certificate

26:02.978 --> 26:06.815
that has my dead name on it,
and then my surgery letter.

26:16.825 --> 26:18.451
-It worked?
-Yeah. I got it.

26:18.535 --> 26:20.453
-Yes!
-Yeah, we're good, man.

26:20.537 --> 26:21.454
We're good.

26:21.538 --> 26:23.456
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

26:23.540 --> 26:29.504
One little marker right there changes
a lot of experiences for me

26:29.587 --> 26:31.214
in my day-to-day life.

26:31.298 --> 26:36.553
The amount of times that you have
to show identification, or job hunting,

26:36.636 --> 26:41.224
like walking into a job interview
and knowing that if I get it,

26:41.308 --> 26:44.686
there's a chance they're gonna
take it away when I pull this ID out.

26:44.769 --> 26:47.188
Like, that's happened to me before.

26:47.772 --> 26:50.191
I've been waiting for this for so long.

26:50.692 --> 26:52.819
I'm so happy right now I wanna cry.

26:52.902 --> 26:54.988
[pop music playing]

27:05.040 --> 27:05.874
I'm coming.

27:06.499 --> 27:08.209
-I got shorter legs.
-I know.

27:08.293 --> 27:11.546
-Like I'm looking back for my husband.
-You smell nice.

27:11.629 --> 27:12.505
Thank you.

27:13.089 --> 27:14.674
-In your bedroom,
-Yes.

27:14.758 --> 27:17.010
I wanna hear what you think you need.

27:17.719 --> 27:21.848
Um... I need, I think, like, stuff
that would take

27:22.057 --> 27:24.142
a floor space that's being covered,

27:24.225 --> 27:27.729
so, maybe just one area of floor space.

27:28.438 --> 27:30.565
-Floor is not where you store things.
-Yes.

27:30.648 --> 27:33.610
-Closets, drawers, boxes and doors.
-Okay.

27:34.110 --> 27:36.071
[Bobby] I like this actually.

27:36.154 --> 27:39.074
-The cool thing about this system,
-That's for me.

27:39.157 --> 27:41.493
it actually has little things like...

27:41.576 --> 27:43.953
That you can just take out
and go to your bed,

27:44.037 --> 27:47.832
you can put what you need, organize it,
you can slide things out.

27:47.916 --> 27:48.750
And then...

27:48.833 --> 27:50.418
-That's neat.
-Right?

27:50.543 --> 27:52.462
-Keep your pants organized.
-Cool.

27:52.545 --> 27:56.216
And the thing is this also allows you
to let go of things,

27:56.299 --> 27:59.052
'cause when you can't see everything
you have--

27:59.135 --> 28:01.262
-You're not paying attention.
-Right.

28:01.346 --> 28:03.890
But when you can,
you're like, "Wait a sec,

28:03.973 --> 28:07.602
I have not worn these in years,
why are they taking up space?"

28:07.685 --> 28:08.937
-Time to go.
-Exactly.

28:09.020 --> 28:10.271
So, out with the old

28:10.355 --> 28:13.858
-and Tan will be in with the new.
-Okay. Whoa.

28:14.275 --> 28:17.195
-What did you find?
-I just like how shiny it is.

28:17.278 --> 28:18.446
It caught my eye.

28:18.530 --> 28:21.074
I know it's not awesome
but it's just shiny.

28:21.157 --> 28:23.159
I like rainbows, rainbows catch my eyes.

28:23.243 --> 28:25.662
-Queer is a pillar of the house.
-Yes.

28:25.745 --> 28:29.040
-Not the trash can, not the art, a pillar.
-Okay.

28:29.582 --> 28:30.458
That's fair.

28:30.542 --> 28:32.961
♪ I'm what you're looking for ♪

28:33.920 --> 28:37.257
I want to do a tight fade
on the sides and your edges,

28:37.340 --> 28:40.260
I wanna take the top down.
For facial hair...

28:40.343 --> 28:42.595
So, for Skyler, when he transitioned,

28:42.679 --> 28:45.515
his facial hair
were the first thing that he had

28:45.598 --> 28:47.892
that really made him feel like a man.

28:47.976 --> 28:51.396
So, I need to approach
the facial hair in a tactful way.

28:51.479 --> 28:54.441
I don't wanna make Skyler
do something he's not ready for.

28:54.524 --> 28:57.569
The length here,
it's making the chin seem long,

28:57.652 --> 28:59.529
you don't have this long face.

28:59.612 --> 29:01.489
So, I wanna take this down,

29:01.573 --> 29:03.575
if you ever want to grow him back,

29:03.742 --> 29:06.953
-I encourage you to grow this part, too.
-Like farther?

29:07.036 --> 29:09.038
-Yes.
-Do you cut it here, though?

29:09.122 --> 29:12.625
There's a rule,
you put a finger on your Adam's apple--

29:12.709 --> 29:14.419
-I don't have one.
-Oh, my gosh.

29:14.502 --> 29:17.547
Your vocal box right here,
which I can totally feel,

29:17.630 --> 29:18.465
that's him.

29:18.548 --> 29:21.217
-That's like my tiny Adam's apple.
-Yeah.

29:21.301 --> 29:25.680
-Don't talk like that, he is huge.
-I got distance that I should let grow.

29:25.764 --> 29:27.807
But it's already going.

29:27.891 --> 29:31.019
By taking your beard down,
it's gonna bridge that gap.

29:31.102 --> 29:34.272
I'm gonna start with a two-guard
which is quite short

29:34.355 --> 29:36.775
but you're not
walking out with a clean face.

29:36.858 --> 29:38.568
-Are we down with that?
-Yeah.

29:38.651 --> 29:42.405
-I didn't wanna make a decision.
-As long as it's not gone.

29:42.489 --> 29:43.990
It's not completely gone.

29:44.073 --> 29:46.534
Skyler and I decide for a stubbly look.

29:46.618 --> 29:49.788
We're gonna make sure
he has a shadow, feeling that masculinity.

29:49.871 --> 29:53.875
So, he's feeling strong,
but not hiding behind this facial hair.

29:53.958 --> 29:54.959
Hi, jawbone.

29:55.043 --> 29:57.754
-Nobody wants that.
-You can see my stubble.

29:57.837 --> 30:01.174
You're giving me shadow
and he's totally insanely hot.

30:01.591 --> 30:03.384
I'm gonna go under your fade.

30:07.597 --> 30:11.392
I wanna gloss your hair.
I'm gonna start this on your face

30:11.476 --> 30:13.978
-and then go to the shampoo room.
-Cool.

30:15.939 --> 30:19.108
So, I'm using semi-permanent on you,
because of that

30:19.192 --> 30:23.446
it doesn't lift your natural hair color
so it'll fade out all the way

30:23.905 --> 30:27.325
and you don't have to worry
about harsh fade lines--

30:27.408 --> 30:29.577
-Upkeep and stuff. Okay.
-Exactly.

30:29.661 --> 30:31.955
-This looks so good.
-Yeah?

30:32.330 --> 30:34.749
Skyler's made a good executive decision,

30:34.833 --> 30:37.168
he decided
to have a perm on his hair.

30:37.252 --> 30:40.171
I support you,
I don't support the wearing of it curly.

30:40.255 --> 30:42.215
I'm gonna show you
how to do a blow dry.

30:42.298 --> 30:43.758
Little tiny hair dryer.

30:43.842 --> 30:46.344
[Jonathan] None of the Golden Girls
wore perms

30:46.427 --> 30:48.304
like a perm, you have to blow it out.

30:48.388 --> 30:50.515
See how I'm using the round brush

30:50.598 --> 30:53.601
push the hair on your head,
like an ironing board.

30:54.561 --> 30:57.355
-Can you get mine to stand up like Tan's?
-Yes.

30:58.147 --> 30:59.941
-I love his hair.
-Me, too.

31:00.441 --> 31:02.068
And now face look.

31:02.402 --> 31:04.654
Makeup has been marketed towards women

31:04.737 --> 31:07.240
but I know men who are full of ingrowns,

31:07.323 --> 31:10.577
who have discrepancies
in their skin that can be suited

31:10.660 --> 31:12.871
by just doing a little makeup.

31:12.954 --> 31:15.540
So, obviously, with being on testosterone,

31:15.623 --> 31:18.418
-that is going to make a lot of extra oil.
-Yes.

31:18.501 --> 31:20.503
It's gonna make you
prone to break out.

31:20.587 --> 31:24.257
When I'm doing grooming on men,
I like to use concealer,

31:24.340 --> 31:25.967
like on your entire face.

31:26.050 --> 31:29.178
Let's go here, here, here. Yes.

31:31.389 --> 31:33.433
-Enough?
-More on your neck.

31:34.267 --> 31:35.685
-Like this?
-Yeah.

31:35.768 --> 31:36.895
More, more, more.

31:36.978 --> 31:40.440
We're gonna start to rub,
'cause this is our foundation.

31:40.523 --> 31:42.650
-Ready to see your new look?
-Yes.

31:43.401 --> 31:47.155
-There's the new and improved Skyler.
-Yeah, looks great.

31:49.741 --> 31:53.286
-That looks good.
-And it's just sexy, like you look good.

31:53.369 --> 31:57.290
Thank you. I appreciate that.
I'm feeling the volume on the hair.

31:57.373 --> 32:01.294
That's giving me
my best life, so thank you.

32:01.502 --> 32:04.964
-Higher the hair, closer to God.
-There you go. I love it.

32:20.521 --> 32:21.397
[Jonathan] Yes.

32:23.024 --> 32:25.068
-[Karamo] We're home.
-[car horn honking]

32:25.151 --> 32:28.112
-Guys, they're here.
-Coming, let me wash my hands.

32:28.196 --> 32:31.699
-I'm ready to see my house. I miss it.
-[Karamo] You have no idea.

32:31.783 --> 32:34.577
-I see people walking.
-I'm ready, I'm excited.

32:35.119 --> 32:36.454
-Okay.
-Oh, my gosh.

32:37.205 --> 32:38.247
[Karamo] We're home.

32:38.998 --> 32:41.876
-Are you ready?
-[Skyler] I don't know, but I'm here.

32:42.961 --> 32:43.962
I'm so excited

32:44.545 --> 32:47.840
Nice, and look the carpet's
actually clean, wonderful.

32:47.924 --> 32:49.592
Yes, I love it.

32:49.676 --> 32:52.971
Thank you for keeping the queer.
High-end queer, I love it.

32:53.054 --> 32:54.889
[Bobby] A new genre, high-end queer.

32:54.973 --> 32:58.601
I love all the art that you put up there,
that looks so good.

32:58.685 --> 33:00.186
[Bobby] You had cool pieces.

33:00.269 --> 33:03.231
I was able to take a lot of stuff
that you already had.

33:03.314 --> 33:06.609
The piss couch,
it's been replaced with a big sectional

33:06.693 --> 33:08.403
for the whole crew to sit on.

33:08.486 --> 33:09.529
This is my spot.

33:10.446 --> 33:11.364
Love it.

33:11.447 --> 33:13.908
It's a place now
that he can entertain the friends

33:13.992 --> 33:18.329
and family that he has on a constant basis
and be the king of his castle.

33:18.413 --> 33:19.288
Are you comfy?

33:19.372 --> 33:20.540
-You love it?
-Yeah.

33:20.623 --> 33:21.833
I love it.

33:22.667 --> 33:26.129
Are you ready
for what an adult man's bed looks like?

33:26.212 --> 33:27.714
Okay, yes, yes.

33:27.797 --> 33:29.132
Yes, yes.

33:33.011 --> 33:36.139
[Bobby] I saw the Todrick Hall posters,
his album Emerald City,

33:36.222 --> 33:38.683
-so, I made this Emerald City.
-[Skyler] Yeah.

33:38.766 --> 33:41.728
And what is more masculine than

33:41.811 --> 33:44.480
old leather tufted sofas and tufted beds?

33:44.564 --> 33:46.566
So, I found a modern leather bed.

33:46.649 --> 33:50.653
This is one of the coolest frames
I've ever seen.

33:51.070 --> 33:54.574
It's like the isle of luxuriation.
Yeah, right here.

33:54.657 --> 33:57.869
I wanted to make sure
that Skyler's room was masculine,

33:57.952 --> 34:01.080
but with color and playful,
because that's Skyler.

34:01.164 --> 34:05.460
So, it's a man's man's room,
but also a cool young hip man's room.

34:06.127 --> 34:09.005
What I want you to make
is two varieties of poke,

34:09.088 --> 34:11.090
a spicy one and a sweet tangy one.

34:11.507 --> 34:14.635
For my lesson,
I want him to prepare something

34:14.719 --> 34:19.432
that's really easy,
and since he loves raw fish so much, poke.

34:19.515 --> 34:21.642
Sushi tuna, you can buy frozen.

34:21.726 --> 34:25.146
The easy thing,
now it's in a block and it's really solid,

34:25.229 --> 34:28.649
it makes it a lot easier to cut,
but I pre-chopped.

34:28.733 --> 34:34.113
So, for our two styles of poke,
super traditional, spicy chili mayo.

34:34.197 --> 34:37.909
-Love it on all my sushi.
-Mayo, sriracha and also sesame oil.

34:37.992 --> 34:40.995
So, I mix that up,
a drizzle, drizzle, drizzle.

34:41.079 --> 34:42.080
Tiny bit of salt.

34:42.622 --> 34:45.708
So, the second one, ponzu,
you can smell it here.

34:45.792 --> 34:49.087
This is, uh, soy sauce that's infused with
yuzu rind.

34:49.170 --> 34:51.464
-Smells good.
-Citrus and lemon skin.

34:51.547 --> 34:53.382
We'll put Ponzu into the mayo,

34:53.466 --> 34:55.843
you wanna mix it up
until it's smooth.

34:55.927 --> 34:58.054
-We're gonna assemble these.
-Okay.

34:58.137 --> 35:01.516
-The serranos in the spicy tuna.
-Okay.

35:01.599 --> 35:03.935
Black sesame seeds. This is for texture

35:04.018 --> 35:06.145
-just to have a little crunch.
-Okay.

35:06.229 --> 35:07.814
It makes it look cuter.

35:08.314 --> 35:12.401
And the white sesame seeds on the white
and a tiny bit of truffle oil.

35:12.485 --> 35:15.488
That's it,
so, what I would suggest is grab these.

35:15.613 --> 35:17.532
-Okay.
-Try whichever you want.

35:17.615 --> 35:19.242
We mix these or just go for it?

35:19.325 --> 35:22.954
[Antoni] I like the fact that
the ingredients are all over the place.

35:23.037 --> 35:24.038
Take a bite.

35:26.999 --> 35:27.834
Mm.

35:27.917 --> 35:29.836
-Love that, very tasty.
-Cool?

35:29.919 --> 35:31.879
-Whoo!
-First things first...

35:33.214 --> 35:34.924
-Enjoy.
-Ooh.

35:35.258 --> 35:37.176
This catches my eye immediately.

35:37.635 --> 35:40.847
Oh, my gosh, that's awesome.
I love that jacket.

35:41.389 --> 35:45.059
-The left side is the work side.
-Okay, work and play.

35:45.143 --> 35:48.020
Yes, I've separated it out
to work and play.

35:48.104 --> 35:51.107
I remember you loved to blur the lines
with androgyny,

35:51.190 --> 35:53.025
you don't mind masculine, feminine.

35:53.109 --> 35:55.236
So, I wanted to really push that.

35:55.319 --> 35:57.363
You said you love Todrick's style.

35:57.446 --> 36:00.158
-Yes, this is so Toddy right here.
-Yes.

36:00.241 --> 36:02.618
-So, this-- Exactly.
-This is Toddy.

36:02.702 --> 36:05.788
-I see it, I love it.
-The romper, the leather pants.

36:05.872 --> 36:06.956
Oh, my God, yes.

36:07.039 --> 36:08.166
I want a sectional.

36:08.916 --> 36:09.750
Yeah.

36:10.334 --> 36:13.212
-I want you trying two lots for the guys.
-Okay.

36:13.296 --> 36:15.423
All right, you guys, here we go.

36:15.506 --> 36:17.758
-First casual look.
-Are you ready?

36:17.842 --> 36:18.926
[all] Yeah.

36:19.510 --> 36:21.762
Ooh. Wow.

36:21.846 --> 36:24.515
-I love the boots.
-I love the three-quarter.

36:24.849 --> 36:29.103
He is shorter than some,
he's pretty much my height.

36:29.187 --> 36:31.063
We create an optical illusion

36:31.147 --> 36:34.775
to make him seem taller,
so, the proportions really help.

36:34.859 --> 36:37.695
We've shown the top of his boot,
tucked in the shirt.

36:37.778 --> 36:40.406
-Balances his proportions.
-[Skyler] You have no idea

36:40.489 --> 36:43.201
what it's like to look
in the mirror and see...

36:43.659 --> 36:44.493
This.

36:44.577 --> 36:49.498
Like be straight and like fit me right,
and like feel broader up here than

36:49.582 --> 36:52.376
I ever have.
Like everything just fits me right.

36:52.460 --> 36:54.337
It feels right, and I've--

36:54.795 --> 36:57.340
First experience,
thank you for sharing it with me.

36:57.423 --> 36:58.758
-Yeah.
-[Skyler] Thank you.

36:58.841 --> 37:02.845
We're gonna take him from this
and put him in a party look.

37:02.929 --> 37:05.056
-Yeah, do it.
-You look awesome.

37:05.139 --> 37:06.724
Thank you, guys.

37:06.807 --> 37:10.144
We are serving you fashion week.
L.A., Paris, London,

37:10.228 --> 37:12.647
you name it, we got it, we're serving it.

37:12.730 --> 37:14.148
-[Tan] Ready for this?
-Yes.

37:14.232 --> 37:16.192
-Ready for this?
-It's kooky,

37:16.275 --> 37:19.153
it's out there, it's clubby,
so, let's see this.

37:19.237 --> 37:21.239
[Fab 5] Yeah, all right.

37:21.322 --> 37:23.199
You made it seem really crazy.

37:23.282 --> 37:25.076
-This is dope.
-[Bobby] You know,

37:25.159 --> 37:28.663
you took the former over-the-top crazy
and you classied the crazy.

37:28.746 --> 37:31.666
Exactly. The sequin jacket
is a lot of look for most people

37:31.749 --> 37:34.543
-but you make it look so easy.
-Thank you, yeah.

37:35.127 --> 37:37.088
And I love stars, actually.

37:37.171 --> 37:39.048
-[Tan] How good we are.
-Thank you.

37:39.131 --> 37:40.341
[Antoni] Sit with us.

37:40.424 --> 37:41.509
-Join us.
-Yes.

37:42.051 --> 37:45.054
-I should be your sixth member.
-I know.

37:46.222 --> 37:49.267
Meeting you has been
a major eye-opening experience

37:49.350 --> 37:52.561
and I'm so glad that we had
that chance to sit

37:52.645 --> 37:55.731
and talk,
and for me to finally ask the questions

37:55.815 --> 37:58.818
that I've been dying to ask
for so many years now.

37:58.901 --> 38:00.945
And as far as fashion goes,

38:01.404 --> 38:05.574
you are a strong man,
you have a position in your community.

38:05.658 --> 38:08.244
Play as much as you want,
enjoy that closet,

38:08.327 --> 38:10.496
-no rules.
-Thank you for elevating me.

38:10.579 --> 38:13.457
-Thank you.
-Skyler, before I go, I would love

38:13.541 --> 38:16.460
for you to get your ID,
I want the guys to see it.

38:16.544 --> 38:17.920
[Skyler] And, bam!

38:18.004 --> 38:19.255
[all] Aw...

38:19.338 --> 38:20.589
[Jonathan] Yes.

38:21.632 --> 38:23.718
-Oh, gosh.
-[Skyler] You guys have no idea

38:23.801 --> 38:26.053
how important that is to me.

38:26.137 --> 38:29.890
The first time I went, it was awful
trying to get that changed,

38:29.974 --> 38:33.436
and the woman that I went to
was just so awful.

38:33.519 --> 38:35.104
She called her supervisor,

38:35.187 --> 38:39.025
it was a big deal, they told me,
"Come back when you're complete."

38:39.108 --> 38:43.154
I was terrified to go alone,
so, thank you, Karamo. I appreciate that.

38:43.237 --> 38:45.614
-I was honored.
-[Skyler] I needed that support.

38:45.698 --> 38:49.243
I can't tell you how honored
I was to be on that journey.

38:49.327 --> 38:52.288
I've worked a lot with the trans community
but after Skyler,

38:52.371 --> 38:54.248
I'm reminded of how much more support

38:54.332 --> 38:57.209
I need to be giving
to my trans brothers and sisters.

38:57.293 --> 38:59.795
People are going to know
that they can live

38:59.879 --> 39:02.214
and thrive and succeed because of you.

39:02.298 --> 39:05.217
We get caught up
in our own struggles and battles,

39:05.301 --> 39:06.719
just as human beings,

39:06.802 --> 39:10.598
and we forget that there's somebody
that needs our love,

39:10.681 --> 39:15.811
and I just hope that more people that are
in the queer community or even outside,

39:15.895 --> 39:19.315
realize that sometimes
all we need is for someone to say:

39:19.857 --> 39:21.692
"I'm ready to show up for you."

39:21.776 --> 39:22.777
-Oh, my God.
-Bye.

39:22.860 --> 39:25.279
-Bye, have fun tonight.
-Bye, thank you.

39:34.246 --> 39:35.998
This is my homage to Skyler.

-Step outside my comfort box.
-I'm loving this.

39:38.501 --> 39:40.836

-I'm loving it.

39:40.920 --> 39:42.505

Get it, girl.

39:50.221 --> 39:52.223
You little jerk, you outdid me.

39:52.306 --> 39:55.434
I thought I should do
a little gender bender today.

39:56.102 --> 39:58.479
-I raided your closet.
-I know you did.

before this goes nasty.

40:00.981 --> 40:03.192
Sit spread-eagled in the couch.

40:03.776 --> 40:05.403
How do ladies do this?

40:05.486 --> 40:07.613
Are we ready to see Skyler?

40:07.696 --> 40:08.864
Yeah.

40:10.032 --> 40:12.326
[Antoni]
He loves sushi. I wanted to teach him

40:12.410 --> 40:14.203
how to make something
super simple.

40:14.286 --> 40:17.873
This is traditional surfer food
in Hawaii, and poke is a salad

40:17.957 --> 40:20.751
made with raw tuna
and any element that you can put in,

40:20.835 --> 40:21.961
cucumber, avocado.

40:22.044 --> 40:24.380
He's taking leftover sushi rice,

40:24.463 --> 40:26.424
we set him up with an air fryer,

40:26.507 --> 40:29.718
he's making crispy rice crackers
with poke on them.

40:30.052 --> 40:31.512
Ooh. I love poke.

40:32.513 --> 40:34.640
Come in to our new home.

-Roma, look.
-Yes.

Kitty, kitty, kitty.

40:41.397 --> 40:42.648
You look good.

40:42.731 --> 40:45.526
You guys like my Toddy inspired sequins?

40:45.609 --> 40:48.654
-I like this, 5 o'clock shadow.
-Yeah.

40:48.737 --> 40:51.240
-He is completely owning this.
-Yeah.

40:51.323 --> 40:52.658
This is the cutest thing.

40:52.741 --> 40:56.370
[Skyler] I have these cool appetizers
that Antoni taught me how to make.

Are you gonna be cooking for us now?

Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

I'm gonna cry.

Todrick Hall is in my house right now.

41:33.741 --> 41:36.160
-Oh, my gosh, this is a cute house.
-Hi.

41:36.243 --> 41:39.163
Now, that's how you give a surprise, baby.

41:39.246 --> 41:42.291
We took him off the walls,
and brought him in person.

41:42.374 --> 41:45.336
-[Todrick] So excited to be here.
-[Mary Lou] Welcome.

41:45.419 --> 41:48.047
Oh, my gosh, "Welcome to our home."
It's so cute.

41:48.130 --> 41:51.467
I can't believe you're in my house.
This is so cool.

41:51.550 --> 41:54.887
We've been talking about you,
who inspires your fashion, your life,

I was like, "Todrick," my only answer,
over and over and over.

-Do you like this jacket?
-Love the jacket.

42:00.392 --> 42:02.645
-Yeah.
-Maybe we can share clothes.

42:02.728 --> 42:04.939
-You can raid my closet.
-I would love that.

42:05.022 --> 42:07.650
-If I'm allowed to raid yours.
-Absolutely.

42:07.733 --> 42:10.027
It's nice to see him vulnerable.

42:10.110 --> 42:11.529
-Emerald green.
-I love it.

42:11.612 --> 42:13.030
-Oh, my gosh.
-Yeah.

I might need to move in.

42:14.865 --> 42:16.367
[laughing]

42:16.450 --> 42:18.911
You're so fun with your fashion,
you play with it,

42:18.994 --> 42:21.914
you bounce back and forth
between feminine and masculine.

42:21.997 --> 42:23.958
You were
so important to my transition,

42:24.041 --> 42:27.044
and recognizing
that I am feminine and I am masculine,

42:27.127 --> 42:30.673
and that gets put into this
perfect little ball that is me.

42:30.756 --> 42:32.758
But it took me
a long time to be okay

42:32.841 --> 42:35.427
with that feminine side
and seeing another queer man

42:35.511 --> 42:38.389
like you that owned all of it
and just was so fabulous.

42:38.472 --> 42:41.642
Your performance inspires me,
who you are inspires me

42:41.725 --> 42:44.937
and I can't praise you enough
in what you've done for me,

42:45.020 --> 42:46.689
-I really can't.
-You're so sweet.

42:46.772 --> 42:49.024
You're gonna make me cry. Thank you.

42:49.984 --> 42:52.861
-[Skyler] I had my top surgery.
-How do you feel?

42:52.945 --> 42:54.613
I feel great. I feel better.

42:54.697 --> 42:59.618
I had some really extreme complications
that put me in the hospital for a while.

42:59.952 --> 43:02.288
There was even a point where I got

43:02.371 --> 43:06.166
so scared that I was laying
in the hospital bed and I was, like

43:06.250 --> 43:07.876
upset and I was crying

43:07.960 --> 43:10.588
and my thought
that came through my head was,

43:10.671 --> 43:11.547
"I want my mom."

43:11.630 --> 43:12.756
Aw.

43:13.007 --> 43:15.175
My friends know
how powerful that is for me,

43:15.259 --> 43:18.095
because my mom and I
haven't spoken in six years.

43:18.178 --> 43:20.306
-She doesn't agree with who I am.
-Oh, wow.

43:20.389 --> 43:23.642
Like, she thinks I'm insane
for wanting to be a man.

43:24.101 --> 43:28.272
But that's how scared I was
sitting in that hospital room and, like...

43:28.355 --> 43:30.190
I want that, like, maternal comfort.

43:30.274 --> 43:32.985
I need someone to hug me
and tell me it's okay

43:33.736 --> 43:36.614
and I was thankful
that I had such a large community base

43:36.697 --> 43:38.866
to come and just be there for me.

43:39.366 --> 43:42.995
I feel like it's important for you to go
and share your story,

43:43.078 --> 43:46.540
because you're such
a beaming light of hope for people

43:46.624 --> 43:49.126
who are just like you and struggling.

43:49.209 --> 43:52.296
Hopefully everything
with your mom works out,

43:52.379 --> 43:55.341
but I think that
it's beautiful that you have

43:55.424 --> 43:58.177
created your own family
and that you chose to be happy

43:58.260 --> 44:01.388
rather than follow in
the footsteps of everyone else.

44:01.472 --> 44:03.682
-This is awesome and beautiful.
-Thank you.

44:03.766 --> 44:06.518
I appreciate that, Todrick,
that means a lot.

44:06.602 --> 44:09.063
-Thank you.
-Oh, I love you.

44:09.146 --> 44:11.065
Aw! Yeah.

44:11.148 --> 44:13.359
-Break a leg. Slay.
-Thank you. Thank you.

44:13.442 --> 44:16.111
-I know you will.
-Just tune in my inner Toddy.

44:16.195 --> 44:18.113
-Okay, awesome.
-Bye.

44:18.197 --> 44:19.740
Bye, you all. Bye, Skyler.

44:25.204 --> 44:26.747
She was just a meme there.

44:26.914 --> 44:30.250
I'm gonna go upstairs
and throw my stuff together.

44:36.757 --> 44:38.926
-[Karamo] Sharp.
-More sophisticated.

44:39.009 --> 44:41.011
He looks amazing, every bit of it.

44:41.136 --> 44:43.263
Oh, no, no, no.

44:43.347 --> 44:46.725
Don't put your collar over your suit.
Not the John Travolta collar.

44:46.809 --> 44:49.770
No, the collar out is horrible,
the rest of it I quite like.

44:51.897 --> 44:53.774
-Whoo!
-Skyler.

44:54.817 --> 44:56.777
-Love it.
-I'll see you later.

44:56.860 --> 44:57.903
Roll out.

45:01.698 --> 45:04.159
-[Mary Lou] All right, we're here.
-Let's go.

45:04.743 --> 45:07.413
-See that M?
-Thank you, sir. Enjoy your time.

45:32.688 --> 45:34.731
[laughing] I love him.

45:34.815 --> 45:37.776
[Skyler] I don't know if you know
why we're here tonight,

45:37.860 --> 45:39.945
but this is a big night for me,

45:40.028 --> 45:44.032
this is my first night back
in the community since I got top surgery.

45:44.116 --> 45:45.367
[crowd cheering]

45:47.119 --> 45:51.415
The community in less than two
and a half months raised $8,000 for me.

45:51.498 --> 45:52.458
[crowd] Yeah!

45:53.834 --> 45:55.919
Eight thousand dollars, y'all.

45:57.546 --> 46:00.007
Thank you from the bottom of my heart.

46:00.299 --> 46:03.302
I cannot tell you
how much you have changed my life.

46:03.594 --> 46:08.140
For years, every single second of my day,
whether you knew it or not,

46:08.390 --> 46:12.102
I was thinking about
how uncomfortable I was in my body,

46:12.519 --> 46:15.397
and how unhappy I was with my body.

46:15.481 --> 46:20.694
I can't tell you guys how awesome it is
to be able to look forward to the future,

46:20.777 --> 46:22.988
-and be excited about it.
-And look sexy!

46:23.071 --> 46:24.072
[Skyler] Thank you.

46:25.073 --> 46:26.158
Thank you.

46:26.241 --> 46:30.204
And finally, after 30 years of living,

46:30.287 --> 46:33.040
I have an ID that says I'm a real boy.

46:33.123 --> 46:34.917
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

46:35.918 --> 46:37.836
I think I needed this to happen

46:37.920 --> 46:40.130
more than I could really wrap
my head around.

46:40.214 --> 46:42.925
Before my top surgery
that was all I could think about,

46:43.008 --> 46:45.844
like every second of my mind space
was occupied by that,

46:45.928 --> 46:49.723
and I couldn't be more thankful
that the guys helped me

46:49.806 --> 46:53.393
become a better person
and see my future more clearly.

46:53.477 --> 46:57.523
I feel more comfortable in this moment
than I have ever felt in my entire life.
