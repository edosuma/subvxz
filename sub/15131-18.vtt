00:00.168 --> 00:01.932
<i>Previously on "Saving Hope"...</i>

00:01.982 --> 00:03.248
Alex: I'm in a coma, Charlie.

00:03.250 --> 00:05.750
When I wake up, let's have a baby.

00:05.752 --> 00:08.153
- Alex. You okay?
- Who are you?

00:08.154 --> 00:09.587
There's this guy
that keeps coming to see me.

00:09.589 --> 00:12.190
So, I hear you got your memory back.

00:12.192 --> 00:14.926
Yeah, all at once. It was kind of intense.

00:14.928 --> 00:16.594
Please let me understand.

00:16.596 --> 00:18.496
I don't think I love you anymore.

00:18.498 --> 00:20.064
Melanda: She's been through a lot.

00:20.066 --> 00:22.066
Alex: Studying for the surgical boards
is no joke, Maggie.

00:22.068 --> 00:24.469
If we fail them,
we've wasted about 10 years of our life.

00:24.471 --> 00:26.170
Rian: I hear you have
a-a surgical board study group,

00:26.172 --> 00:27.204
I would love to be a part of it.

00:27.206 --> 00:28.539
Alex: Study group has to start on time

00:28.541 --> 00:30.174
and end on time for once today.

00:30.176 --> 00:31.308
Someone's got a hot date.

00:31.310 --> 00:33.143
I don't want to break your heart, Charlie.

00:33.145 --> 00:34.345
Charlie: Well, you can't.

00:34.347 --> 00:36.313
Because you are my heart, Alex.

00:36.315 --> 00:39.116
We could just go and give
ourselves to something amazing.

00:39.118 --> 00:40.951
There are amazing things here.

00:40.953 --> 00:42.652
- There certainly are.
- No, I need to stop this

00:42.654 --> 00:44.821
because I know how it ends... we crash!

00:44.823 --> 00:46.891
- No, we don't crash, Alex!
- You always crash!

00:46.893 --> 00:48.825
We make this work!

00:48.827 --> 00:51.027
Dana: So... who's the hmm-hmm?

00:51.029 --> 00:52.662
Alex: An orthopedic surgeon.

00:52.664 --> 00:54.063
I'm pregnant, Charlie.

00:54.065 --> 00:55.231
We're all wondering who's the daddy.

00:55.233 --> 00:56.666
Alex: I'm having a boy?

00:56.668 --> 00:58.067
Charlie: Well, she is right.

00:58.069 --> 00:59.369
It is safer to wait
until after the baby's born

00:59.371 --> 01:00.670
to do a paternity test, so...

01:00.672 --> 01:02.005
It's the right thing to do.

01:02.007 --> 01:04.340
Just need to show a little bit of patience.

01:04.342 --> 01:05.742
What did you want to ask me?

01:05.744 --> 01:07.743
It's nothing. It can wait.

01:11.148 --> 01:15.651
Okay, Mr. Man, let's see
which end is up in there.

01:15.653 --> 01:18.321
All right, his head's down,
so he's not in breech,

01:18.323 --> 01:19.822
- which is excellent news.
- [sighs] Good.

01:19.824 --> 01:21.090
Is the head engaged yet?

01:21.092 --> 01:22.558
No, but it doesn't mean much.

01:22.560 --> 01:24.393
It'll engage when she goes into labor.

01:24.395 --> 01:25.728
Which won't be for another week.

01:25.730 --> 01:26.896
Most likely.

01:26.898 --> 01:28.531
- Let's check your blood pressure.
- Okay.

01:28.533 --> 01:32.200
Sydney, I got you... this.

01:32.202 --> 01:33.536
"Team Sha-Lex."

01:33.538 --> 01:35.871
It's a portmanteau,
like "smog" or "Brangelina."

01:35.873 --> 01:37.205
Shahir plus Alex equals...

01:37.207 --> 01:38.574
Sha-Lex. Nice.

01:38.576 --> 01:40.409
That's right. Well,
I was hoping each one of us

01:40.411 --> 01:42.411
could wear this during
the birth. That's for you.

01:42.413 --> 01:44.512
Just tell me that
I'll be able to write my boards.

01:44.514 --> 01:46.181
It'll be fine. Maybe Mr. Eight pounds here

01:46.183 --> 01:48.183
will even answer a few questions for you.

01:48.185 --> 01:49.517
- Eight pounds?
- Yeah.

01:49.519 --> 01:51.286
My baby is eight pounds?

01:51.288 --> 01:53.655
- Go, Sha-Lex!
- [chuckles]

01:56.625 --> 01:58.626

Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:26.077 --> 02:27.388
You look awful.

02:27.390 --> 02:28.722
Thank you very much.

02:28.724 --> 02:29.890
I haven't been sleeping much lately.

02:29.892 --> 02:32.225
Have you seen Alex or talked to her?

02:32.227 --> 02:33.894
About anything other than work? No.

02:33.896 --> 02:35.729
She's writing her boards today.

02:35.731 --> 02:37.297
Alex. That's what
you're talking about, right?

02:37.299 --> 02:39.399
- Her boards.
- Writing her boards... is that even safe?

02:39.401 --> 02:41.434
Safer than you two stressing her out.

02:43.304 --> 02:44.805
I can see your knees.

02:44.807 --> 02:46.473
Why am I remarking on that?

02:46.475 --> 02:48.475
Gentlemen, perfect.
Just the guys I'm looking for.

02:48.477 --> 02:49.775
Hammond military base just called.

02:49.777 --> 02:52.445
They need an orthopod
and some emergency support.

02:52.447 --> 02:53.913
Okay. Anything more specific?

02:53.915 --> 02:55.315
Yeah, guy's got a mortar shell stuck in him.

02:55.317 --> 02:57.984
I'm sorry. He has a...

02:57.986 --> 02:59.952
Guy has a mortar shell
stuck inside of his body.

02:59.954 --> 03:01.187
- How did it get there?
- I don't know.

03:01.189 --> 03:03.155
Some type of training exercise. Who's in?

03:03.157 --> 03:04.524
- I'm in.
- Definitely me.

03:04.526 --> 03:06.358
Actually, th-this sounds
a little bit dangerous, Joel.

03:06.360 --> 03:08.193
Why don't you let me, the more
senior surgeon, handle it?

03:08.195 --> 03:09.862
I think it's really cute that people

03:09.864 --> 03:11.831
of the older generation are
trying to become more active.

03:11.833 --> 03:13.265
He's extremely fragile.

03:13.267 --> 03:16.068
20-something male, hypothermia
and a busted arm. Half-hour out.

03:16.070 --> 03:17.770
Oh, or there's that.

03:17.853 --> 03:19.604
- I'm gonna go with the military base, yeah.
- You need the better surgeon.

03:19.654 --> 03:20.663
That's my point exactly...

03:20.713 --> 03:21.539
- you need the better surgeon.
- Well...

03:21.542 --> 03:24.209
We're gonna flip for it. Works with my kids.

03:24.211 --> 03:25.377
Heads.

03:25.379 --> 03:26.478
Heads it is.

03:26.480 --> 03:27.546
You're coming with me.

03:27.548 --> 03:29.714
You get the coin and the frozen guy.

03:29.716 --> 03:32.717
[siren wails in distance]

03:32.719 --> 03:34.553
My lucky day.

03:37.657 --> 03:39.323
- Need one of these?
- Yeah, mate.

03:39.325 --> 03:43.828
And get me a field trauma kit
and an intubation pack.

03:43.830 --> 03:46.998
I'm on it.

03:47.000 --> 03:50.334
Saw Alex earlier today. She
looks like she's ready to pop.

03:50.336 --> 03:51.869
I don't know if this has anything to do

03:51.871 --> 03:53.671
with my father getting sick
recently or whatever.

03:53.673 --> 03:55.206
But for some reason, I just feel ready.

03:55.208 --> 03:56.541
Well, for what it's worth,

03:56.543 --> 03:58.376
we got you winning the paternity pool.

03:58.378 --> 04:00.044
Think we're good to go, right?

04:00.046 --> 04:02.547
Dude, you cut off a leg
with a pair of bolt cutters.

04:02.549 --> 04:04.215
I'm not too worried.

04:04.217 --> 04:07.318
- All right.
- Hey.
- Hey.

04:07.320 --> 04:08.986
- Wow!
- [chuckles]

04:08.988 --> 04:10.654
I feel like a parade float.

04:10.656 --> 04:12.590
A beautiful parade float.

04:12.592 --> 04:15.693
Hey, good luck today with the,
uh, boards, okay?

04:15.695 --> 04:17.695
Thanks. It's pretty nerve-racking.

04:17.697 --> 04:19.596
Yeah, I remember mine. I threw
up in the car on the way there.

04:19.599 --> 04:21.430
Yeah, I'm pretty much guaranteed to do that.

04:21.433 --> 04:23.033
- Pretty much.
- [chuckles]

04:23.035 --> 04:24.367
Hey, Alex.

04:24.369 --> 04:25.702
Yeah?

04:25.704 --> 04:27.637
You're golden.

04:30.708 --> 04:32.542
[indistinct conversations]
[Alex groaning]

04:32.544 --> 04:35.545
Oh, wow. I stick out like a sore thumb.

04:35.547 --> 04:37.547
Hey. No, no, no, no, no.
The pregnancy looks great.

04:37.549 --> 04:38.848
The dress looks great.

04:38.850 --> 04:40.517
Well, it's the best I could get
at maternity barn.

04:40.519 --> 04:42.184
- Nice suit, by the way.
- Thank you.

04:42.186 --> 04:44.687
I spent the last of my line
of credit on this bad boy.

04:44.689 --> 04:46.255
Me too. Maxed out.

04:46.257 --> 04:47.590
I should have brought my saltines.

04:47.592 --> 04:49.759
- Can I just lean on you for a second?
- Yeah, sure.

04:49.761 --> 04:50.927
That's better.

04:50.929 --> 04:52.762
How are you feeling?

04:52.764 --> 04:53.930
Are you referring to this

04:53.932 --> 04:55.598
or how I feel about my written exams?

04:55.600 --> 04:58.767
Oh, man, I did not do well on those.

04:58.769 --> 05:02.104
Guys, can we just not
talk about the writtens

05:02.106 --> 05:04.440
and just take the last
five minutes before the orals

05:04.442 --> 05:06.475
to talk about just anything else.

05:06.477 --> 05:09.745
Okay. [clears throat]

05:09.747 --> 05:12.748
Did you find yourself circling
a lot of C's on that test?

05:13.600 --> 05:15.250
I had A's and D's going head-to-head.

05:15.252 --> 05:17.585
- Damn it. Oh, man.
- [sighs]

05:17.587 --> 05:20.122
Okay. They want us to pass.

05:20.124 --> 05:22.958
That has to be our attitude going in.

05:22.960 --> 05:24.793
It's gonna be great.

05:24.795 --> 05:26.795
[gasps]

05:26.797 --> 05:29.597
My water just broke.

05:32.450 --> 05:33.627
Jackson, what do we got?

05:33.629 --> 05:35.330
Well, Graeme here spent the night outside.

05:35.332 --> 05:37.165
Driver found him laying
on the side of the road

05:37.167 --> 05:38.499
up near Silent Lake.

05:38.501 --> 05:40.001
Is he naked? Was he swimming?

05:40.003 --> 05:42.670
- Why is he naked?
- I don't know.
- These are his personal effects.

05:42.672 --> 05:43.938
Graeme, why are you naked?

05:43.940 --> 05:45.039
M-m-mystery.

05:45.041 --> 05:46.874
Okay, let's get him some warming blankets

05:46.876 --> 05:48.709
'cause buddy boy here
needs to get get tucked in.

05:48.711 --> 05:51.211
Now, Graeme, try not to move your arm.

05:51.213 --> 05:53.748
You've got what appears to be
a severely dislocated elbow,

05:53.750 --> 05:56.650
and your arm is very cold,
so you probably can't feel that.

05:56.652 --> 05:57.818
Let's get him 100 fentanyl.

05:57.820 --> 05:59.286
What's his temperature?

05:59.288 --> 06:02.089
Uh, so low I can't get one.
SAT monitor isn't registering.

06:02.091 --> 06:04.091
Okay, well, he's got severe
frostbite in his nose and ears,

06:04.093 --> 06:06.293
and these fingers
look pretty gnarly, so, uh,

06:06.295 --> 06:08.295
let's keep an eye on those, okay.

06:08.297 --> 06:11.298
Graeme, I'm going to pop your elbow back in.

06:11.300 --> 06:13.633
So, do you want to tell me
how all this happened?

06:13.635 --> 06:15.769
M-m-m-m-m-m-mystery.

06:15.771 --> 06:16.836
Okay. Dawn!

06:16.838 --> 06:18.505
Yo, Dawn!

06:18.507 --> 06:21.173
- What?
- Little help here, please.

06:21.175 --> 06:23.976
Ooh!

06:23.978 --> 06:26.446
I hate the E.R. It reminds me of snakes.

06:26.448 --> 06:27.980
Severe case of hypothermia.

06:27.982 --> 06:29.549
You're worried about rewarming shock?

06:29.551 --> 06:31.451
Yep.

06:31.453 --> 06:33.119
His heartbeat is erratic.

06:33.121 --> 06:35.354
Okay, microwave some saline.
I'm gonna run some warm fluids.

06:35.356 --> 06:36.212
Let's book an O.R.

06:36.262 --> 06:38.824
Returning blood flow's gonna overwhelm
that arm and cut off the circulation.

06:38.826 --> 06:40.359
Predicting the future. I like it.

06:40.361 --> 06:42.528
Okay, I'll meet you in the O.R.

06:42.530 --> 06:44.363
I can monitor his heart
and warm him up there.

06:44.365 --> 06:46.698
See? We're having some fun.

06:46.700 --> 06:48.367
- Yeah.
- [chuckles]

06:48.369 --> 06:50.869
Was he naked? Why was he naked?

06:50.871 --> 06:52.638
Mystery.

06:52.640 --> 06:53.972
[sighs]

06:53.974 --> 06:56.408
Okay. Get them to postpone the exam.

06:56.410 --> 06:58.744
If it was the writtens, maybe,
but they won't redo the orals.

06:58.746 --> 06:59.745
Not for anyone.

06:59.747 --> 07:01.179
Okay, so do it next year.

07:01.181 --> 07:03.682
I won't be a new mother and a resident.

07:03.684 --> 07:04.850
I can't do it.

07:04.852 --> 07:07.553
It's now or never.
I have to pass those exams.

07:07.555 --> 07:09.554
- Okay. You're not dilated.
- [sighs]

07:09.556 --> 07:11.889
- That's good news.
- [groans]

07:11.891 --> 07:13.558
- Are you having a contraction?
- Mm-hmm!

07:13.560 --> 07:15.226
Okay, so who do you want me
to call? Joel or Charlie?

07:15.228 --> 07:16.727
[groans] Both!

07:16.729 --> 07:17.996
- [sighs]
- [sighs]

07:17.998 --> 07:20.332
Okay. You need to time your contractions.

07:20.334 --> 07:23.001
Each station is 15 minutes long
with 2 minutes in between,

07:23.003 --> 07:24.669
so as long as it's a slow labor...

07:24.671 --> 07:26.170
Thanks, Maggie.

07:26.172 --> 07:28.673
You can sit your exam and
we can get you to the hospital.

07:28.675 --> 07:30.842
- Here's my watch. Use it.
- Okay.

07:30.844 --> 07:33.010
Rian: - How's she doing?
Maggie: - She's in labor.

07:33.012 --> 07:34.946
Labor? Like... like...

07:34.948 --> 07:36.447
- Yes.
- Like she's getting... right?

07:36.449 --> 07:37.363
- Yes.
Woman: - Welcome to part two

07:37.413 --> 07:38.548
of the surgical boards.

07:38.551 --> 07:40.250
There's one question per station.

07:40.252 --> 07:42.052
Any talking in the hall, you fail.

07:42.054 --> 07:43.887
How far apart do my contractions have to be

07:43.889 --> 07:45.306
before we go to the hospital?

07:45.356 --> 07:46.811
- Less than five minutes.
- You're two hours away

07:46.861 --> 07:48.503
from your career as surgeons.

07:48.694 --> 07:51.295
Whatever you do, don't kill any patients.

07:51.297 --> 07:53.030
[exhales deeply]

07:54.265 --> 07:56.700
[helicopter blades whirring]

08:15.819 --> 08:17.153
- Welcome to Hammond.
- Thank you.

08:17.155 --> 08:18.421
I'm Captain Isaac.

08:18.423 --> 08:21.090
Corporal Britt Delkus.
I'm the field medic here.

08:21.092 --> 08:23.259
- I'm Joel Goran.
- Zach Miller.

08:23.261 --> 08:25.261
Turn off your phones, please, gentlemen.

08:25.263 --> 08:26.429
What for?

08:26.431 --> 08:28.597
Safety. They can trigger an explosion.

08:28.599 --> 08:30.266
- Yeah.
- So, here's what's going on...

08:30.268 --> 08:32.299
we were doing some weapons familiarization.

08:32.302 --> 08:33.434
And a mortar went astray.

08:33.437 --> 08:34.803
We hope it doesn't detonate

08:34.804 --> 08:36.605
before you guys can get it out of him.

08:36.607 --> 08:38.106
This kind of accident happen often?

08:38.107 --> 08:39.607
No. That's why you're here.

08:39.610 --> 08:43.311
Delkus: Put these on, please.

08:43.313 --> 08:45.313
We got more people coming,
but you're here first.

08:45.315 --> 08:48.150
Joel: - Okay.
- Corporal Delkus is gonna take you guys in.

08:48.152 --> 08:49.984
- Get your bottom strap.
- Thank you.

08:49.986 --> 08:52.154
[breathing heavily]

08:52.156 --> 08:54.322
So, what exactly
are we dealing with here, guys?

08:54.324 --> 08:56.658
- Single casualty, male, 28.
- Okay, let's go.

08:56.660 --> 08:58.660
He's in class 1 hypovolemic shock,

08:58.662 --> 09:00.995
but I've managed to stabilize him for a bit.

09:00.997 --> 09:02.330
I've given him two amps of morphine,

09:02.332 --> 09:03.998
and we're doing
what we can to keep him warm.

09:04.000 --> 09:05.833
Joel: - Okay.
- Whoa.

09:05.835 --> 09:08.937
It's an unexploded
81-millimeter mortar round.

09:12.708 --> 09:15.710
We're all just waiting
for this thing to go off.

09:15.712 --> 09:17.712
[breathing heavily]

09:23.351 --> 09:26.019
45-year-old female
presents with painless jaundice.

09:26.021 --> 09:28.021
She's lost 10 pounds
in the last three weeks.

09:28.023 --> 09:30.023
- How do you proceed?
- I would take a good history,

09:30.025 --> 09:32.726
and I would do a careful,
detailed physical exam.

09:32.728 --> 09:34.161
I would take a good history,

09:34.163 --> 09:36.397
and I would do a careful,
detailed physical exam.

09:36.399 --> 09:38.398
I would take a good history

09:38.400 --> 09:41.401
and do a careful,
detailed physical exam, sir.

09:41.403 --> 09:43.971
I would check for indications
of abdominal pain.

09:43.973 --> 09:46.640
I'd want to rule out
any hepatotoxicity effect.

09:46.642 --> 09:48.541
I'd ask the patient if they had any itching.

09:48.543 --> 09:50.310
- Gallstones.
- Damage to the liver.

09:50.312 --> 09:51.411
Obstructive jaundice.

09:51.413 --> 09:52.980
[sighs]

09:52.982 --> 09:54.680
Everything all right?

09:54.682 --> 09:56.849
Mm-hmm.

09:56.851 --> 09:59.185
[monitor beeping]
Dawn: Temperature coming up any?

09:59.187 --> 10:00.553
Sharpe: Nope.

10:00.555 --> 10:05.391
Okay. I'm gonna run saline
and warm up this cold heart.

10:05.393 --> 10:07.227
Charlie: Any bets on how this happened?

10:07.229 --> 10:08.728
Naked in the snow?

10:08.730 --> 10:10.896
Two words... "insta. Gram."

10:10.898 --> 10:12.564
- [chuckles]
- That's one word.

10:12.566 --> 10:15.234
It was probably paradoxical undressing.

10:15.236 --> 10:16.902
Right before you freeze to death,

10:16.904 --> 10:19.338
your blood vessels dilate
and you feel incredibly hot.

10:19.340 --> 10:22.307
That would explain the nudity
but not the guitar.

10:22.309 --> 10:23.308
It's true.

10:25.178 --> 10:28.347
Okay. Fascia's open.
He's not gonna lose the arm.

10:28.349 --> 10:30.349
Now let's check on his fingers.

10:30.351 --> 10:32.184
[heavy metal ringtone playing]

10:35.522 --> 10:36.721
Fingers are not pinking up.

10:36.723 --> 10:39.124
Can you answer that? It's unbearable.

10:40.860 --> 10:42.361
Hello?

10:42.363 --> 10:45.130
Okay. Thank you.

10:47.266 --> 10:48.933
[sighs]

10:48.935 --> 10:51.202
Okay, let's give these fingers
a chance before we cut them off.

10:51.204 --> 10:54.372
And someone page me a resident,
help me wrap this arm.

10:54.374 --> 10:55.640
I can help you.

10:55.642 --> 10:57.809
I have to stay to monitor his heart, anyway.

10:57.811 --> 10:59.877
Thank you.

11:01.980 --> 11:04.315
[sighs]

11:06.117 --> 11:08.452
That was Dr. Lin.

11:08.454 --> 11:11.455
Alex is... in labor.

11:13.559 --> 11:14.892
Oh.

11:16.795 --> 11:18.461
Hmm.

11:18.463 --> 11:21.264
So, how exactly did this thing land on you?

11:21.266 --> 11:23.901
Best guess?

11:23.903 --> 11:26.904
Leg of the tube gave out and misfired

11:26.906 --> 11:29.573
and the shoulder of the mortar
ricocheted off something.

11:29.575 --> 11:31.241
[sighs] Can you give us a second?

11:31.243 --> 11:32.375
We're gonna figure this out.

11:36.480 --> 11:39.249
Delkus: So what's our move?

11:39.251 --> 11:42.252
Hop him back in the chopper,
take him to the O.R.

11:42.254 --> 11:43.786
That's not gonna happen.
He's gonna bleed out.

11:43.788 --> 11:44.991
Well, we can't wait

11:45.041 --> 11:46.955
- for the cavalry to arrive.
- No.

11:46.958 --> 11:48.625
I mean, I can tie off
a few of those bleeders,

11:48.627 --> 11:50.960
get a better idea of how that
mortar's positioned in there.

11:50.962 --> 11:52.661
- Call the bomb guy.
- Exactly.

11:52.663 --> 11:54.430
I'm the bomb guy.

11:54.773 --> 11:56.001
- You're what?
- You're the...

11:56.051 --> 11:58.083
I'm the platoon's combat engineer.

11:58.436 --> 12:00.002
Explosives are my thing.

12:00.004 --> 12:03.606
It's ironic, sir.

12:10.513 --> 12:12.180
You know how to defuse this?

12:12.182 --> 12:15.183
If it wasn't stuck in my gut.

12:15.185 --> 12:16.685
The detonator's on the tip.

12:16.687 --> 12:18.687
If you can pull it out,

12:18.689 --> 12:20.623
I can unscrew it and pull out the fuse.

12:20.625 --> 12:22.791
Excellent.

12:22.793 --> 12:26.661
Um, well, this, uh [chuckles]
should be interesting.

12:26.663 --> 12:29.064
Yeah. We're, uh... it's all good.

12:29.066 --> 12:30.598
Okay.

12:34.082 --> 12:35.549
- I need more gauze.
- Coming.

12:35.551 --> 12:36.716
Want me to pack that?

12:36.718 --> 12:37.717
Yeah. Nice and easy.

12:37.719 --> 12:39.053
- Nice and easy.
- Yeah, yeah.

12:39.055 --> 12:41.388
One thing the army has
is gauze... gauze for days.

12:41.390 --> 12:42.556
We pray to gauze around here.

12:42.558 --> 12:44.124
How did this thing hit you and not explode?

12:44.126 --> 12:44.940
[breathing raggedly]

12:44.990 --> 12:47.428
I guess these rock-hard abs
weren't enough to trigger it.

12:47.430 --> 12:48.963
[all chuckle]

12:48.965 --> 12:51.465
So, we're good... it won't go off

12:51.467 --> 12:53.399
as long as we don't drop it
when it comes out, right?

12:53.401 --> 12:56.235
No. It's armed. It's ready.

12:56.237 --> 12:57.938
What do you mean it's armed?
What could trigger this?

12:57.940 --> 13:01.808
It's a pressure detonator,
so a twig could trigger it.

13:01.810 --> 13:05.278
Just hitting it with something
could trigger it.

13:05.280 --> 13:07.447
Sparks.

13:07.449 --> 13:09.582
It's designed to explode.

13:09.584 --> 13:11.084
Mm-hmm.

13:11.086 --> 13:13.252
If it hasn't, you're waiting.

13:13.254 --> 13:14.920
Go slow quickly, if you know what I mean.

13:14.922 --> 13:17.423
I'll be as gentle and as fast as I can.

13:17.425 --> 13:20.326
A little dumb... luck.

13:20.328 --> 13:21.361
You are pretty dumb.

13:21.363 --> 13:22.661
I'm also lucky, mate.

13:22.663 --> 13:25.163
Better lucky than smart, right?

13:25.165 --> 13:28.433
Hey, Corporal, you always wanted
some operational experience.

13:28.435 --> 13:29.768
You two have never been deployed, have you?

13:29.770 --> 13:31.336
We were supposed to ship out tomorrow.

13:31.338 --> 13:33.772
This is one way to get out of active duty.

13:33.774 --> 13:35.240
Okay, I think we're ready to lift this out.

13:35.242 --> 13:37.943
- You should let me do that.
- No, no, I... no, I got a good feel.

13:37.945 --> 13:40.546
And, uh, I think it's tamponading
some arteries in there.

13:40.699 --> 13:43.715
Be aware that this thing
is gonna bleed like crazy.

13:43.717 --> 13:45.017
Uh, I'll go proximal.

13:45.019 --> 13:46.184
All right, I'll stabilize the pelvis.

13:46.186 --> 13:47.352
- Careful, okay?
- Yep.

13:47.354 --> 13:49.021
- And on three... real three.
- Yeah.

13:49.023 --> 13:51.023
Oh, Jesus.

13:51.025 --> 13:52.157
Uh, one...

13:52.159 --> 13:53.191
- Two...
- Two...

13:53.193 --> 13:54.326
- Three.
- Three.

13:54.328 --> 13:56.694
[groans, screams]

13:56.696 --> 14:00.398
- Okay, stop. Stop.
- Okay.

14:00.400 --> 14:02.734
Marcel: [grunts]

14:02.736 --> 14:04.268
[breathing raggedly]

14:06.204 --> 14:08.039
Damn it. It's embedded in the pelvis.

14:08.041 --> 14:10.307
Wait, what does that mean?

14:10.309 --> 14:12.307
I-it's stuck in your bone, sarge.

14:12.357 --> 14:14.378
The iliac wing, to be specific. That's the, uh,

14:14.380 --> 14:16.580
bone that curves around your pelvis.

14:16.582 --> 14:17.915
Can't pull it out?

14:17.917 --> 14:20.584
No. I need to get in there with some tools.

14:20.586 --> 14:21.685
Chip away the bone.

14:21.687 --> 14:23.187
Can you do that here?

14:23.189 --> 14:26.357
- No, no.
- I feel like I'm freezing to death.

14:26.359 --> 14:27.558
[groans]

14:27.560 --> 14:29.760
No. We have to move him.

14:29.762 --> 14:31.161
[groaning, whimpering]

14:37.234 --> 14:38.735
Steady. Don't shake him.

14:38.737 --> 14:39.736
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

14:39.738 --> 14:41.905
We get there, you do the B.P.

14:41.907 --> 14:44.407
Zach, you hang blood ASAP.

14:44.409 --> 14:47.743
He doesn't actually outrank me,
just so you know.

14:49.680 --> 14:54.016
It's nice and sterile in here.
It's just like a Hope-Zee O.R.

14:54.018 --> 14:56.052
Okay. Uh, let's get a rundown of the gear.

14:56.054 --> 14:58.020
You need anything, you let me know.

14:58.022 --> 15:01.023
Corporal Delkus, you're relieved.

15:01.025 --> 15:03.193
What? I'm not leaving you, sir.

15:03.195 --> 15:04.393
Go. That's an order.

15:04.395 --> 15:08.397
Delkus, you showed good instincts out there.

15:08.399 --> 15:09.732
You'll be fine.

15:09.734 --> 15:11.567
[breathing heavily]

15:11.569 --> 15:13.202
You too, guys.

15:13.204 --> 15:16.271
Last chance... go, no go.

15:16.273 --> 15:18.608
- Let's go.
- Let's definitely go.

15:20.210 --> 15:22.377
[monitor beeping]

15:22.379 --> 15:24.379
[breathes deeply]

15:29.285 --> 15:31.453
[breathes deeply]

15:38.260 --> 15:40.929
[sighs]

15:40.931 --> 15:43.999
I can't handle this level
of manly silence in my O.R.

15:44.001 --> 15:46.735
I thought this was my O.R., Dawn.

15:46.737 --> 15:48.302
Silence is a source of great strength.

15:48.304 --> 15:49.804
It's also a source of great irritation.

15:49.806 --> 15:51.806
It's... I feel like
I should be doing something, okay?

15:51.808 --> 15:54.242
Like, I-I don't know, boiling
water or something like that.

15:54.244 --> 15:55.709
Boiling water has no medical value.

15:55.711 --> 15:57.044
That was just something they did

15:57.046 --> 15:58.479
to get the father out of the room.

15:58.481 --> 16:00.148
- Really?
- Yeah.

16:00.150 --> 16:02.350
I bet on you, you know?

16:02.352 --> 16:03.784
In the paternity pool.

16:03.786 --> 16:05.153
Thank you.

16:05.155 --> 16:07.188
I bet on you, too.

16:07.190 --> 16:08.456
Really?

16:08.458 --> 16:09.432
Yeah.

16:09.482 --> 16:11.458
If you cared about anything
as much in our marriage,

16:11.460 --> 16:13.293
I would weigh 300 pounds, have 14 kids.

16:13.295 --> 16:16.463
That's a very sweet image
you've conjured into my brain.

16:16.465 --> 16:17.831
Thank you very much, Dawn.

16:17.833 --> 16:20.167
May I say this as a friend?

16:20.169 --> 16:22.169
You need to do the thought experiment.

16:22.171 --> 16:23.637
What if you're not the father?

16:25.273 --> 16:26.939
I'll get a dog.

16:26.941 --> 16:28.608
[beep]

16:28.610 --> 16:30.810
Okay. 15 minutes are up.

16:30.812 --> 16:33.313
[sighs]

16:33.315 --> 16:35.649
All right.

16:35.651 --> 16:37.651
- Oh...Oh!
- Okay.

16:37.653 --> 16:39.653
Those are fully necrotic.
They're not coming back.

16:39.655 --> 16:41.188
So, can't wake him up to ask permission.

16:41.190 --> 16:43.222
Dr. Bell...

16:43.224 --> 16:44.891
Do you concur that I should
amputate these fingers?

16:44.893 --> 16:45.925
I do.

16:45.927 --> 16:47.994
- Dr. Sharpe, do you also concur?
- I do.

16:47.996 --> 16:51.164
All right, I now declare
you amputated fingers.

16:51.166 --> 16:53.166
And, Dawn...

16:53.168 --> 16:55.334
been doing the thought experiment every day.

16:55.336 --> 16:56.803
Charlie, I'm just...

16:56.805 --> 17:00.306
Ah. Don... Moment of silence, please.

17:00.308 --> 17:01.574
For the fingers.

17:03.142 --> 17:06.512
Good enough. Scalpel.

17:06.513 --> 17:08.180
[woman crying]

17:08.182 --> 17:11.349
She just won't quit.

17:11.352 --> 17:13.185
Imagine if she was your surgeon.

17:13.186 --> 17:15.186
[chuckles]

17:15.189 --> 17:16.688
[sighs, winces]

17:16.690 --> 17:18.690
Are you okay?

17:18.692 --> 17:20.858
[strained] Mm-hmm. Yep.

17:20.861 --> 17:23.528
Okay, Alex, we need to get you
to the hospital right away.

17:23.530 --> 17:26.198
No. There's still two doors left.

17:26.200 --> 17:28.032
Have you had your rest station yet?

17:28.035 --> 17:30.869
There's a rest station?

17:30.871 --> 17:33.705
Alex, if your contractions are
less than five minutes apart...

17:33.707 --> 17:35.373
I know, hospital. I know. I know.

17:35.375 --> 17:37.275
- [buzzer]
- [sighs]

17:37.277 --> 17:40.311
[sighs]

17:43.849 --> 17:48.519
Man: 70-year-old male,
status post Harmann for sepsis.

17:48.521 --> 17:51.688
He's in the ICU, hypotensive.

17:51.690 --> 17:56.526
His CVP is 10,
wedge pressure 14, and SVR 600.

17:56.528 --> 17:57.862
[exhales deeply]

17:57.864 --> 17:59.029
Drugs to use?

18:03.034 --> 18:05.035
[groans softly]

18:07.438 --> 18:09.939
Do you need me to repeat the question?

18:09.941 --> 18:12.376
[strained] No.

18:12.378 --> 18:15.211
How's that infusion coming?

18:15.213 --> 18:16.546
This should take the edge off.

18:16.548 --> 18:20.884
I'm so high. I keep seeing my son's face.

18:20.886 --> 18:22.218
[breathing raggedly]

18:22.220 --> 18:24.888
It's like he's saying,
"hang in there, daddy."

18:24.890 --> 18:26.222
"Hang in there."

18:26.224 --> 18:28.057
How old's your boy?

18:28.059 --> 18:29.458
He's 3.

18:29.460 --> 18:33.963
Yeah? I got two boys myself. 9 and 12.

18:33.965 --> 18:35.265
I can't wait for that age.

18:35.267 --> 18:36.732
Oh, it's the best, you know?

18:36.734 --> 18:39.568
They're out of diapers, you
can get them to wash your car.

18:39.570 --> 18:40.903
[groans]

18:40.905 --> 18:42.070
Crank his morphine.

18:42.072 --> 18:43.639
I do want to keep him breathing.

18:43.641 --> 18:46.642
Hey. I'd like that, too.

18:46.644 --> 18:48.744
Marcel, I have to operate,
and we do not have anesthetic.

18:48.746 --> 18:51.246
He's gonna be cutting into
your bone. It's going to hurt.

18:51.248 --> 18:53.582
You so much as twitch, yeah?

18:53.584 --> 18:55.583
Boom.

18:55.585 --> 18:57.286
- Boom.
- Boom.

18:59.289 --> 19:01.623
So what's the plan, Stan?

19:01.625 --> 19:03.125
Gonna drill four holes,
chisel under the bone,

19:03.127 --> 19:04.459
pull this bad boy out of your pelvis.

19:04.461 --> 19:06.461
- That's a terrible plan.
- It's all I got.

19:06.463 --> 19:09.497
Good luck.

19:09.499 --> 19:11.700
[helicopter blades whirring]

19:14.804 --> 19:18.873
[sighs] Good afternoon.

19:18.875 --> 19:20.542
[clears throat]

19:20.544 --> 19:24.946
The subject is male, early 20s,
experiencing weight loss...

19:24.948 --> 19:27.114
[strained] Expelling
reddish sputum, fever.

19:27.116 --> 19:29.450
I'm guessing he's got a... bit of a cough...

19:29.452 --> 19:31.618
a few months, minimum.

19:31.620 --> 19:33.687
[exhales sharply]
Excuse me, are you in labor?

19:33.689 --> 19:37.024
I'm fine. Okay.

19:37.026 --> 19:38.692
So, the C.T. tells me

19:38.694 --> 19:42.529
that there is a collarbone
abscess, subcutaneous.

19:42.531 --> 19:43.831
Yes, there it is...

19:43.833 --> 19:46.166
abscess in the lymph node
of the left mediastinum.

19:46.168 --> 19:49.169
I am also noticing extensive
parenchymal abnormalities

19:49.171 --> 19:50.471
in the left lobe.

19:50.473 --> 19:52.973
[sighing] Okay.

19:52.975 --> 19:55.976
It's a tuberculous abscess.

19:55.978 --> 19:57.811
A sputum smear
should show acid-fast bacteria,

19:57.813 --> 19:59.079
and I would treat it

19:59.081 --> 20:02.015
with 6 weeks of the standard
anti-tuberculous treatment.

20:02.017 --> 20:03.449
If scarring is a concern,

20:03.451 --> 20:05.952
I would suggest minor cosmetic
surgery, pending no relapse.

20:05.954 --> 20:06.987
If you'll just excuse me,

20:06.989 --> 20:08.521
I'm just gonna go and deliver my baby.

20:08.523 --> 20:10.556
[whimpering] Thank you for your time.

20:10.558 --> 20:12.225
Oh, my god.

20:12.227 --> 20:13.493
[whimpers]

20:15.168 --> 20:17.849
[siren chirping]

20:18.558 --> 20:19.824
Joel, it's Maggie.

20:19.826 --> 20:21.692
Alex is having her baby,
so... so call me, okay?

20:21.694 --> 20:23.694
- [groaning loudly]
- He's not picking up.

20:23.696 --> 20:25.896
- Okay, just breathe. Breathe.
- Yeah...

20:25.898 --> 20:27.565
Yeah, I'm trying. Maggie, this is crazy.

20:27.567 --> 20:29.233
You need to go back and finish your exam.

20:29.235 --> 20:32.035
Well, you happen to need an
ob-gyn right now, and I am it.

20:32.037 --> 20:34.037
Ohh, they don't tell you this
when you're trying to get pregnant.

20:34.039 --> 20:36.073
- You tried?
- Well, I wasn't not trying!

20:36.075 --> 20:37.641
Okay? I think I wanted to be a mother.

20:37.643 --> 20:39.242
Oh, my god, Maggie.

20:39.244 --> 20:40.443
Okay, don't think about that now.

20:40.445 --> 20:41.778
This is a mess!

20:41.780 --> 20:43.313
My family's a mess, Joel's family's a mess,

20:43.315 --> 20:44.314
Charlie's an orphan.

20:44.316 --> 20:45.849
I did not think this through.

20:45.851 --> 20:48.318
Okay, don't think about anything
like that now, okay?

20:48.320 --> 20:50.153
Ohh! Call Shahir!

20:50.155 --> 20:51.655
Okay, I'm gonna call Shahir,

20:51.657 --> 20:52.823
and I'm gonna call Charlie, too.

20:52.825 --> 20:54.624
I want you to have someone there with you.

20:54.626 --> 20:55.891
No, you're here with me.

20:55.893 --> 20:58.894
My god, this is like
one <i>long</i> contraction.

20:58.896 --> 21:00.263
- Hi, it's Maggie.
- Wow.

21:00.265 --> 21:01.631
Can you page Dr. Katz?

21:01.633 --> 21:04.066
- We're incoming, on our way to maternity.
- [sighs]

21:04.068 --> 21:05.735
I am so glad that you're here. [chuckles]

21:05.737 --> 21:07.570
Everything's gonna be great, okay?

21:07.572 --> 21:09.071
Breathe. Breathe.

21:09.073 --> 21:10.273
[exhales sharply]

21:10.275 --> 21:11.674
[sighing] Breathe.

21:11.676 --> 21:14.677
[breathing shakily]

21:14.679 --> 21:15.978
Damn it.

21:15.980 --> 21:17.747
I can't get an angle
on this section of the pelvis.

21:17.749 --> 21:19.281
Okay, what do you want me to do?

21:19.283 --> 21:21.517
There's nothing we can do, man.
It's... [sighs]

21:21.519 --> 21:24.520
This whole setup is so... It's so awkward.

21:24.522 --> 21:26.255
Do you want to... let's switch.

21:26.257 --> 21:29.758
- Okay.
- [sighs]

21:29.760 --> 21:30.925
Hey, man.

21:30.927 --> 21:32.961
[sighs] I think
I can handle this on my own.

21:32.963 --> 21:33.838
What are you talking about?

21:33.888 --> 21:35.263
- I'm in my element here.
- You have two kids.

21:35.266 --> 21:35.861
[muttering]

21:35.911 --> 21:37.182
Yeah, I don't want to die, but neither do you.

21:37.232 --> 21:39.168
It's not worth the risk for you,
okay? You're a father.

21:39.170 --> 21:41.370
So is he. I'm not leaving him.

21:44.606 --> 21:46.607
- No. Don't take that off.
- I need to move.

21:46.609 --> 21:48.977
- I have to take it off, Marcel.
- You can't...

21:48.979 --> 21:50.979
Hey. I can't move in that thing, all right?

21:50.981 --> 21:52.981
Okay, look.

21:52.983 --> 21:55.449
Steady as a rock.

21:55.451 --> 21:58.486
Steady as a rock.

22:00.455 --> 22:02.323
Let's do this.

22:02.325 --> 22:04.492
[grunting]

22:04.494 --> 22:05.560
[drill whirring]

22:05.562 --> 22:09.197
[groaning]

22:09.199 --> 22:10.565
Lay still!

22:10.567 --> 22:13.734
Buddy, you cannot move, okay?

22:13.736 --> 22:14.735
One more time.

22:14.737 --> 22:15.836
- We're almost there.
- Here we go.

22:15.838 --> 22:18.405
[drill whirring] [whimpering]

22:20.541 --> 22:23.711
Dawn: I don't think he's gonna
be playing guitar anymore.

22:23.713 --> 22:26.413
Remember when you used to
play guitar for me, Charlie?

22:26.415 --> 22:28.816
He would shred away
like "Yengwee Malmsteen."

22:28.818 --> 22:32.152
Yngwie Malmsteen. Yes, I remember.

22:32.154 --> 22:34.153
I remember you making marbleized coasters.

22:34.155 --> 22:37.023
Those were nice coasters.
They looked like real marble.

22:37.025 --> 22:39.058
Mm. "Yingway"? So overrated.

22:39.060 --> 22:40.493
<i>Yngwie. Top-3, all-time.</i>

22:40.495 --> 22:42.028
- Ugh!
- Don't argue with me.

22:42.030 --> 22:43.863
- Oh, my god.
- Yeah, I don't like that twiggly-wiggly stuff.

22:43.865 --> 22:47.400
You give me a slow jam any day.
John Mayer, John Legend...

22:47.402 --> 22:49.369
This is exactly why we got divorced, Dawn.

22:49.371 --> 22:51.437
[heavy metal ringtone playing]

22:53.741 --> 22:56.408
Go.

22:56.410 --> 22:58.845
We can handle this. Go.

23:09.222 --> 23:11.223
[indistinct conversations]

23:32.711 --> 23:35.147
[groaning]

23:35.149 --> 23:37.149
You got this. You got this.

23:37.151 --> 23:38.416
[breathing heavily]

23:38.418 --> 23:41.085
- Okay, lady, you are fully dilated.
- Okay.

23:41.087 --> 23:42.287
Too late for an epidural.

23:42.289 --> 23:43.621
Ohh, of course it is.

23:43.623 --> 23:44.955
Time to push.

23:44.957 --> 23:46.457
- Now?!
- Yes, now.

23:46.459 --> 23:47.625
Oh, my god. Baby's crowning.

23:47.627 --> 23:48.626
- Okay.
- I can see the head.

23:48.628 --> 23:49.927
- [straining]
- Push.

23:51.963 --> 23:53.964
Again. Again.

23:53.966 --> 23:55.733
No, I just... I just need
a minute. I need a minute.

23:55.735 --> 23:57.301
No, I need you to push for me now.

23:57.303 --> 23:58.969
- Okay.
- Okay? Don't rest now.

23:58.971 --> 24:00.070
[groaning]

24:00.072 --> 24:01.638
I've got the head! I've got the head.

24:01.640 --> 24:02.973
[chuckling] Okay.

24:02.975 --> 24:04.008
Push!

24:04.010 --> 24:05.442
[groaning]

24:05.444 --> 24:07.077
- Aah!
- I need you to push harder.

24:07.079 --> 24:08.078
I'm trying!

24:08.080 --> 24:09.246
One more. Harder.

24:09.248 --> 24:10.547
[groaning loudly]

24:14.319 --> 24:15.319
Wait a minute!

24:15.321 --> 24:16.753
What? Is everything okay?

24:16.755 --> 24:18.922
[panting]

24:18.924 --> 24:20.957
- [groans]
- Stop pushing, Alex. Stop.

24:20.959 --> 24:23.293
Okay. Okay.

24:23.295 --> 24:24.961
This is exciting.

24:24.963 --> 24:27.631
Labor, dilation, the "ring of fire"...

24:27.633 --> 24:28.965
- Shahir?
- Mm-hmm?

24:28.967 --> 24:32.368
Could you, um, relax
with the play-by-play, please?

24:32.370 --> 24:34.871
[sighs]

24:34.873 --> 24:39.209
She's, he's. Could've, should've.

24:39.211 --> 24:41.510
Can't, won't.

24:41.512 --> 24:42.545
What are you doing?

24:42.547 --> 24:46.248
Just having some <i>contractions.</i>

24:47.984 --> 24:49.985
That is very lame.

24:49.987 --> 24:52.488
True, but that's enough to make you laugh.

24:52.490 --> 24:54.990
And that endorphin release will
increase your pain threshold,

24:54.992 --> 24:57.993
make what's bothering you bother you less.

24:57.995 --> 25:00.329
Just... I have a bad feeling.

25:00.331 --> 25:01.831
About the birth?

25:01.833 --> 25:04.333
[siren wails in distance]

25:04.335 --> 25:07.402
I don't know. I don't know.
It's about Alex? I don't...

25:07.404 --> 25:10.072
I don't know.

25:10.074 --> 25:11.473
Do you believe in omens?

25:11.475 --> 25:13.075
Omens? No.

25:13.077 --> 25:17.079
Yeah, I know. It sounds kind of...

25:20.816 --> 25:22.484
S... [sighs]

25:22.486 --> 25:24.151
Something isn't right.

25:24.153 --> 25:25.152
What are you doing?!

25:25.154 --> 25:26.688
Just let me think a second, okay?

25:26.690 --> 25:28.222
Is my baby okay?

25:28.224 --> 25:29.691
Shoulder's stuck under your pubic bone.

25:29.693 --> 25:31.058
We need to think of something else.

25:31.060 --> 25:33.395
Okay, so plan "B"! Plan "B"!

25:33.397 --> 25:34.382
Plan "B." "B" is for "baby."

25:34.432 --> 25:35.561
- Eve, I need you over here.
- Okay?

25:35.564 --> 25:37.564
- [exhaling sharply]
- Get her legs for me.

25:37.566 --> 25:39.233
Okay, I want suprapubic pressure. Okay.

25:39.235 --> 25:42.370
I'm gonna do the wood's screw
maneuver to turn his shoulders

25:42.372 --> 25:44.571
- and deliver the posterior arm.
- [whimpering]

25:44.573 --> 25:47.741
- Ohh!
- Shoulder's stuck.

25:47.743 --> 25:49.710
Okay. Shouldn't you call Dr. Katz?

25:49.712 --> 25:51.379
No, it's too late.
Baby can't breathe this way.

25:51.381 --> 25:52.946
So we need to get him out right away.

25:52.948 --> 25:54.615
- Okay.
- Okay?

25:54.617 --> 25:56.349
Oh, I am so scared, Maggie!

25:56.351 --> 25:58.018
I know, honey. I know. I'm here, okay?

25:58.020 --> 25:59.686
- We... we've got this. We've got this.
- Okay.

25:59.688 --> 26:01.555
- Okay? Breathe. Breathe.
- Okay.

26:01.557 --> 26:02.723
I trust you.

26:02.725 --> 26:04.858
I trust you. I trust you. Okay, plan "B."

26:04.860 --> 26:07.093
- Plan "B."
- [laughs] [chuckling] Plan "B." Okay, breathe.

26:07.095 --> 26:09.062
Breathe.

26:09.064 --> 26:10.863
I'm gonna bend his collarbone, okay?

26:10.865 --> 26:12.765
- What?! What?!
- You're gonna what?! Don't worry.

26:12.767 --> 26:14.200
It's okay. Babies bend.

26:14.202 --> 26:15.902
Do not break my baby, Maggie!

26:15.904 --> 26:19.439
I will not break the baby. Come on. Come on.

26:19.441 --> 26:20.640
One last push.

26:20.642 --> 26:22.075
[screaming]

26:22.077 --> 26:24.744
[laughing] Okay!

26:24.746 --> 26:26.145
[baby crying]

26:26.147 --> 26:28.314
[panting]

26:37.724 --> 26:40.059
Okay. It's okay.

26:40.061 --> 26:43.728
You're okay. You're okay.

26:43.730 --> 26:44.729
Hey, baby.

26:44.731 --> 26:46.898
- [crying stops]
- Ohh.

26:46.900 --> 26:48.900
- That's a good boy.
- [laughs]

26:48.902 --> 26:51.236
[laughing] Oh, my god, Maggie.

26:51.238 --> 26:52.938
[sniffles]

26:54.345 --> 26:56.691
Okay, hold on. How are you feeling, Alex?

26:56.693 --> 26:59.359
I'm okay. Isn't he cute and smart-looking?

26:59.361 --> 27:01.195
Yeah, once they're born,
I don't really care anymore.

27:01.197 --> 27:03.197
- Did she deliver the placenta?
- Not yet, no.

27:03.199 --> 27:05.132
Okay, guys, I'll meet you
in the birthing room.

27:05.134 --> 27:06.967
- And you passed your exams. What a day.
- Order me 10 units of oxytocin I.M.

27:06.969 --> 27:07.968
Maggie, freeze.

27:07.970 --> 27:09.203
She was in active labor,

27:09.205 --> 27:11.138
and the baby presented
with shoulder dystocia?

27:11.140 --> 27:13.307
Yeah, there was no time
to call you. It was crazy.

27:13.309 --> 27:14.508
Talk me through what you did.

27:14.510 --> 27:17.511
Okay. I-I put her in McRoberts position.

27:17.513 --> 27:19.346
I applied suprapubic pressure.

27:19.348 --> 27:20.681
I did the Wood's screw maneuver.

27:20.683 --> 27:22.849
I-I tried to deliver the posterior arm.

27:22.851 --> 27:25.118
That didn't work,
so I bent the baby's clavicle.

27:25.120 --> 27:26.820
And if that hadn't worked,
what would you have done?

27:26.822 --> 27:29.155
Zavanelli's maneuver.

27:29.157 --> 27:32.458
Okay. Thanks.

27:32.460 --> 27:34.393
What was that?

27:34.395 --> 27:37.063
