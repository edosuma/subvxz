00:09.000 --> 00:10.333
I don't want any

00:09.000 --> 00:10.333
trouble here, Barclay.

00:11.959 --> 00:14.083
Trouble?

00:11.959 --> 00:14.083
Why would there be trouble?

00:15.709 --> 00:18.500
Because wherever you

00:15.709 --> 00:18.500
go, trouble follows.

00:18.542 --> 00:21.834
Lieutenant Barclay,

00:18.542 --> 00:21.834
you're on duty.

00:21.875 --> 00:22.917
Is that a fact?

00:22.959 --> 00:25.000
It is,<i> and</i> you'll observe it.

00:25.041 --> 00:27.000
So get back

00:25.041 --> 00:27.000
to your post.

00:27.041 --> 00:30.583
Look, pal,

00:27.041 --> 00:30.583
why don't you do me a favor.

00:30.625 --> 00:34.625
Take yourself and your

00:30.625 --> 00:34.625
holier-than-thou attitude

00:34.667 --> 00:35.917
and get out of my life.

00:44.500 --> 00:46.542
This is insubordination,

00:44.500 --> 00:46.542
Mr. Barclay.

00:53.417 --> 00:55.125
Here's to insubordination.

00:59.125 --> 01:02.291
Riker, you're nothing

00:59.125 --> 01:02.291
but a pretty mannequin

01:02.333 --> 01:03.834
in a fancy uniform.

01:03.875 --> 01:05.667
You're full

01:03.875 --> 01:05.667
of hot air.

01:05.709 --> 01:08.166
If Picard has

01:05.709 --> 01:08.166
a problem with me

01:08.208 --> 01:11.250
you tell him to come

01:08.208 --> 01:11.250
and talk to me himself.

01:30.625 --> 01:33.750
I feel your confidence,

01:33.792 --> 01:36.125
your arrogant resolve.

01:38.500 --> 01:39.792
It excites me.

01:43.041 --> 01:45.750
CREWMAN:

01:43.041 --> 01:45.750
Lieutenant Barclay,

01:43.041 --> 01:45.750

02:17.959 --> 02:20.000
I just don't know

02:17.959 --> 02:20.000
what to do with him.

02:20.041 --> 02:21.041
The guy's always late.

02:21.083 --> 02:22.083
He never gives

02:21.083 --> 02:22.083
his best effort.

02:22.125 --> 02:24.250
Just slides by.

02:24.291 --> 02:26.458
I'm telling you,

02:24.291 --> 02:26.458
I can't deal with it anymore.

02:26.500 --> 02:28.709
I mean, how does a guy like that

02:26.500 --> 02:28.709
make it through the academy?

02:28.750 --> 02:30.834
I think it's time we

02:28.750 --> 02:30.834
spoke to the captain

02:28.750 --> 02:30.834
about Broccoli.

02:32.000 --> 02:33.083
That's what Wesley

02:32.000 --> 02:33.083
calls him.

02:33.125 --> 02:34.291
You keep that

02:33.125 --> 02:34.291
to yourself.

02:34.333 --> 02:35.583
Well, it fits.

02:35.625 --> 02:37.125
Commander, a broken seal.

02:38.375 --> 02:39.375
Well, you better

02:38.375 --> 02:39.375
destroy it.

02:39.417 --> 02:40.917
Those samples

02:39.417 --> 02:40.917
will be tainted.

02:48.208 --> 02:50.375
Hey!

02:50.417 --> 02:51.542
Is it a problem for you

02:51.583 --> 02:52.959
to report to duty

02:51.583 --> 02:52.959
on time, Lieutenant?

02:55.041 --> 02:56.291
No... no, sir.

02:58.000 --> 03:01.041
I'm ... I'm very,

02:58.000 --> 03:01.041
very sorry, sir.

03:01.083 --> 03:02.375
It's just that I had a...

03:02.417 --> 03:04.959
a very important communiqué,

03:02.417 --> 03:04.959
which required

03:05.000 --> 03:06.375
my immediate response.

03:06.417 --> 03:07.625
I don't want to hear it.

03:08.959 --> 03:10.959
Now, we're having

03:08.959 --> 03:10.959
an intermittent problem

03:11.000 --> 03:12.333
with this antigrav unit.

03:12.375 --> 03:13.625
I want you to see

03:12.375 --> 03:13.625
what you can do.

03:17.750 --> 03:19.291
Mr. Barclay, I'm tired

03:19.333 --> 03:21.083
of seeing

03:19.333 --> 03:21.083
your name on report.

03:21.125 --> 03:22.583
I don't know

03:21.125 --> 03:22.583

We could use a hand,

Mr. Barclay.

06:20.834 --> 06:23.542
Uh, I'll disassemble it

06:20.834 --> 06:23.542
later, Commander.

06:23.583 --> 06:25.542
It shouldn't do that.

Uh, well, I... I mean...

06:30.542 --> 06:32.333
it shouldn't do that.

06:52.291 --> 06:53.750
I'm just not accustomed

06:52.291 --> 06:53.750
to seeing

06:53.792 --> 06:56.375
an unsatisfactory rating

06:53.792 --> 06:56.375
on a member of my crew.

06:56.417 --> 06:57.834
I guess the question

06:57.875 --> 07:00.208
is whether Mr. Barclay

06:57.875 --> 07:00.208
is<i> Enterprise</i> material.

07:00.250 --> 07:02.291
And I assume

07:00.250 --> 07:02.291
by your request for his transfer

07:02.333 --> 07:03.625
that you think he's not,

07:02.333 --> 07:03.625
Commander.

07:03.667 --> 07:06.959
Well, I hate to say it, but...

07:07.000 --> 07:09.333
I always thought

07:07.000 --> 07:09.333
I could work with anybody

07:09.375 --> 07:10.667
but I just don't

07:09.375 --> 07:10.667
understand this guy.

07:10.709 --> 07:12.625
Broccoli makes me nervous,

07:10.709 --> 07:12.625
Captain.

07:12.667 --> 07:13.959
He makes

07:12.667 --> 07:13.959
everybody nervous.

07:14.000 --> 07:15.000
Broccoli?

07:15.041 --> 07:16.875
Young Mr. Crusher started that.

07:16.917 --> 07:18.583
I guess it's caught on.

07:18.625 --> 07:21.333
Let's just get that

07:18.625 --> 07:21.333
"uncaught," shall we?

07:21.375 --> 07:22.709
There's every

07:21.375 --> 07:22.709
indication that he's

07:22.750 --> 07:25.375
served competently

07:22.750 --> 07:25.375
in Starfleet for years.

07:25.417 --> 07:27.792
Ratings aboard the<i> Zhukov</i>

07:25.417 --> 07:27.792
were satisfactory.

07:27.834 --> 07:29.792
In fact, I recall

07:27.834 --> 07:29.792
Captain Gleason

07:29.834 --> 07:32.291
speaking quite highly of him

07:29.834 --> 07:32.291
before his transfer.

07:32.333 --> 07:33.917
In retrospect, I wonder

07:33.959 --> 07:36.542
if Captain Gleason wasn't

07:33.959 --> 07:36.542
buttering our bread a little.

07:36.583 --> 07:39.041
He knew that we needed

07:36.583 --> 07:39.041
a diagnostic engineer.

07:39.083 --> 07:41.542
I've examined Barclay's

07:39.083 --> 07:41.542
psychological profile.

07:41.583 --> 07:43.750
He has a history

07:41.583 --> 07:43.750
of seclusive tendencies.

07:43.792 --> 07:45.792
It was noted at the academy

07:43.792 --> 07:45.792
more than once.

07:45.834 --> 07:47.625
And yet,

07:45.834 --> 07:47.625
he chose this way of life.

07:47.667 --> 07:49.709
He has made the same commitment

07:47.667 --> 07:49.709
to Starfleet that we all have.

07:49.750 --> 07:52.166
(<i> sighs</i> )

07:52.208 --> 07:55.458
It's easy to transfer a problem

07:52.208 --> 07:55.458
to someone else.

07:55.500 --> 07:56.709
Too easy.

07:56.750 --> 07:58.667
Captain, it's not

07:56.750 --> 07:58.667
like I haven't tried.

07:58.709 --> 08:01.166
Try harder, Geordi.

08:01.208 --> 08:02.917
He's a member of your team.

08:04.709 --> 08:06.083
Try to find some way

08:06.125 --> 08:08.375
to help him to make

08:06.125 --> 08:08.375
a positive contribution.

08:08.417 --> 08:11.166
Get to know the man better.

08:11.208 --> 08:13.166
Make him

08:11.208 --> 08:13.166
your best friend.

08:13.208 --> 08:16.041
With all due respect, sir,

08:13.208 --> 08:16.041
"my best friend"?

08:16.083 --> 08:19.291
I can barely tolerate being

08:16.083 --> 08:19.291
in the same room with the man.

08:19.333 --> 08:20.792
I suggest you put

08:19.333 --> 08:20.792
your personal discomfort

08:20.834 --> 08:22.458
on one side, Commander.

08:22.500 --> 08:24.834
Dismissed.

08:24.875 --> 08:26.083
Yes, sir.

08:31.458 --> 08:33.041
(<i> sighs</i> )

08:46.208 --> 08:47.500
Hey, Reg.

08:50.458 --> 08:52.542
How, uh...

08:50.458 --> 08:52.542
how's it going?

08:52.583 --> 08:54.458
Oh, uh, it's...

08:54.500 --> 08:56.750
I... I still

08:54.500 --> 08:56.750
haven't traced down

08:56.792 --> 08:58.875
the problem, Commander.

08:58.917 --> 08:59.875
It's all right.

08:59.917 --> 09:01.250
There's no problem.

09:01.291 --> 09:03.417
I've... I've been planning

09:01.291 --> 09:03.417
to run diagnostics

09:03.458 --> 09:06.250
on the graviton

09:03.458 --> 09:06.250
inverter's circuits.

09:06.291 --> 09:07.333
Smart plan.

09:07.375 --> 09:09.458
I'd say we're

09:07.375 --> 09:09.458
in good hands here.

09:09.500 --> 09:12.792
Well, I'll see you get

09:09.500 --> 09:12.792
a preliminary report...

09:12.834 --> 09:14.208
Whenever.

09:14.250 --> 09:15.792
Before the end of the day.

09:15.834 --> 09:18.041
Fine. Fine.

09:20.166 --> 09:22.875
Oh... say, Reg,

09:22.917 --> 09:24.500
how about sitting in

09:22.917 --> 09:24.500
on the mission briefing

09:24.542 --> 09:26.125
with my senior officers

09:24.542 --> 09:26.125
in the morning?

09:26.166 --> 09:27.750
Th-the briefing? Me?

09:27.792 --> 09:29.625
I'd like your input.

09:29.667 --> 09:30.959
What on?

09:31.000 --> 09:32.875
I mean, do...

09:31.000 --> 09:32.875
do you want me to prepare...

09:32.917 --> 09:36.500
No, no, just be there.

09:36.542 --> 09:38.291
0800 hours.

09:38.333 --> 09:40.250
I'll... I'll be on time, sir.

09:40.291 --> 09:42.875
Good. Good.

09:42.917 --> 09:44.291
Carry on.

09:59.125 --> 10:00.125
Morning.

10:00.166 --> 10:01.250
Start your brains,

10:00.166 --> 10:01.250
gentlemen

10:01.291 --> 10:04.125
and let's do it.

10:04.166 --> 10:05.709
Has anybody seen

10:04.166 --> 10:05.709
Lieutenant Barclay?

10:05.750 --> 10:07.125
Not yet, sir.

10:07.166 --> 10:09.000
(<i> sighs</i> )

10:09.041 --> 10:10.709
Okay.

10:10.750 --> 10:13.250
(<i> panting</i> )

10:13.291 --> 10:16.625
Okay.

10:16.667 --> 10:18.834
This trip to Nahmi IV

10:16.667 --> 10:18.834
is pretty routine

10:18.875 --> 10:21.291
so we'll have plenty of time to

10:18.875 --> 10:21.291
realign the magnetic capacitors

10:21.333 --> 10:24.125
of both the matter<i> and</i>

10:21.333 --> 10:24.125
anti-matter injectors.

10:24.166 --> 10:26.625
Duffy, Costa, that'll

10:24.166 --> 10:26.625
be your assignment.

10:26.667 --> 10:28.959
We probably ought to do

10:26.667 --> 10:28.959
the flow regulator maintenance

10:29.000 --> 10:30.500
at the same time, Commander.

10:30.542 --> 10:31.709
That's a good idea.

10:31.750 --> 10:33.375
Ensign Crusher will be

10:33.417 --> 10:34.500
putting in some hours

10:33.417 --> 10:34.500
with us this week

10:34.542 --> 10:36.125
as part of his

10:34.542 --> 10:36.125
training duties.

10:36.166 --> 10:38.542
So, I'll be assigning

10:36.166 --> 10:38.542
him to assist you, Mr. Myers.

10:38.583 --> 10:39.917
Be sure and teach

10:38.583 --> 10:39.917
him the difference

10:39.959 --> 10:41.792
between impulse and

10:39.959 --> 10:41.792
warp drive, please.

10:41.834 --> 10:43.417
(<i> chuckling</i> )

10:43.458 --> 10:45.417
Lieutenant Barclay has been

10:43.458 --> 10:45.417
working on the mystery

10:45.458 --> 10:47.917
of the antigrav failure

10:45.458 --> 10:47.917
we had yesterday.

10:47.959 --> 10:49.333
Your preliminary report

10:49.375 --> 10:51.583
had a couple of interesting

10:49.375 --> 10:51.583
theories, Reg.

10:52.834 --> 10:54.291
Why don't you

10:54.333 --> 10:56.583
bring us all up to speed

10:54.333 --> 10:56.583
on your findings so far.

10:57.875 --> 10:59.375
Yes.

11:02.500 --> 11:05.333
It... it wasn't

11:02.500 --> 11:05.333
a maintenance problem.

11:05.375 --> 11:08.250
Every-everything

11:05.375 --> 11:08.250
checked out.

11:08.291 --> 11:11.542
I'm... I'm going to

11:08.291 --> 11:11.542
look for a surge in

11:08.291 --> 11:11.542
the transfer coils...

11:11.583 --> 11:14.125
Oh, a coil surge

11:11.583 --> 11:14.125
wouldn't have resulted

11:11.583 --> 11:14.125
in field dissipation.

11:14.166 --> 11:16.208
I-I... I realize that.

11:16.250 --> 11:18.375
But we shouldn't ignore

11:16.250 --> 11:18.375
the possibilities, Wes.

11:18.417 --> 11:20.125
You ought to check

11:18.417 --> 11:20.125
the flow capacitor.

11:20.166 --> 11:21.375
A breakdown of that

11:20.166 --> 11:21.375
could have caused

11:21.417 --> 11:23.166
a chain collapse

11:21.417 --> 11:23.166
of the antigrav fields.

11:23.208 --> 11:26.458
I... I was going to.

11:26.500 --> 11:28.125
Good.

11:28.166 --> 11:29.625
Okay, then, let's, uh...

11:29.667 --> 11:31.667
take a look

11:29.667 --> 11:31.667
at that realignment procedure.

11:31.709 --> 11:32.792
Gentlemen.

11:34.208 --> 11:35.709
DUFFY:

11:34.208 --> 11:35.709
Yeah, the bipolar

11:34.208 --> 11:35.709
flux device was...

11:35.750 --> 11:37.083
COSTA:

11:35.750 --> 11:37.083
Commander...

11:42.125 --> 11:44.291
I just didn't know what to say.

11:44.333 --> 11:46.041
What do you wish

11:44.333 --> 11:46.041
you had said?

11:46.083 --> 11:48.583
I should have told him

11:46.083 --> 11:48.583
to mind his own damn business.

11:48.625 --> 11:49.875
I knew about

11:48.625 --> 11:49.875
the flux capacitor

11:49.917 --> 11:52.208
but I didn't need to

11:49.917 --> 11:52.208
hear about it

11:52.250 --> 11:54.583
from some

11:52.250 --> 11:54.583
17-year-old kid.

11:54.625 --> 11:57.333
You're letting this

11:54.625 --> 11:57.333
get you much too upset.

11:57.375 --> 11:58.583
You think so?

12:01.583 --> 12:04.125
Why are you so

12:01.583 --> 12:04.125
hard on yourself?

12:06.458 --> 12:08.625
You don't know.

12:08.667 --> 12:10.500
It's hard out there.

12:10.542 --> 12:14.583
I understand,

12:10.542 --> 12:14.583
but let go of it.

12:14.625 --> 12:16.750
You're here now.

12:16.792 --> 12:20.041
You're right, of course.

12:20.083 --> 12:22.000
Of course.

12:23.792 --> 12:26.417
Let me help you relax.

12:26.458 --> 12:28.542
I'd like that.

12:28.583 --> 12:30.083
I knew you would.

12:38.333 --> 12:42.125
Mmm, that's nice...

12:42.166 --> 12:46.041
But... I'm in the mood

12:46.083 --> 12:50.000
for someplace

12:46.083 --> 12:50.000
a little more...

12:50.041 --> 12:51.917
unusual.

12:54.583 --> 12:57.375
Computer,

12:54.583 --> 12:57.375
run Barclay program 15.

13:04.709 --> 13:07.625
I am the goddess of empathy.

13:09.792 --> 13:12.458
Cast off your inhibitions

13:12.500 --> 13:14.834
and embrace love,

13:14.875 --> 13:18.083
truth, joy.

13:38.375 --> 13:39.875
But I thought that's

13:38.375 --> 13:39.875
the point of the briefing--

13:39.917 --> 13:41.250
to discuss

13:39.917 --> 13:41.250
different approaches...

13:41.291 --> 13:43.375
It's not that you did

13:41.291 --> 13:43.375
anything wrong, Wes.

13:43.417 --> 13:45.375
It's just that Barclay's...

13:45.417 --> 13:47.208
Well, he's my new project.

13:47.250 --> 13:50.500
Yeah, Broccoli's a real project,

13:47.250 --> 13:50.500
all right.

13:50.542 --> 13:52.542
I just need to draw him out

13:50.542 --> 13:52.542
some more.

13:52.583 --> 13:55.333
And I shut him down.

13:55.375 --> 13:57.083
Poor Broccoli.

13:58.375 --> 14:00.125
Pardon me.

14:00.166 --> 14:03.166
But why is Lieutenant Barclay

14:00.166 --> 14:03.166
being referred to

14:03.208 --> 14:04.500
clandestinely

14:03.208 --> 14:04.500
as a vegetable?

14:07.250 --> 14:08.583
It's a joke, Data.

14:08.625 --> 14:10.750
You know, a nickname?

14:10.792 --> 14:14.417
Nicknames generally denote

14:10.792 --> 14:14.417
fondness.

14:14.458 --> 14:17.291
A diminutive shared

14:14.458 --> 14:17.291
between friends.

14:17.333 --> 14:19.375
Data's absolutely right.

14:19.417 --> 14:22.125
The nickname stops here and now.

14:22.166 --> 14:23.667
Captain's orders.

14:26.792 --> 14:29.458
What..? What the hell..?

14:30.709 --> 14:32.500
What happened to your glass?

14:47.750 --> 14:50.542
(<i> tricorder beeping</i> )

14:52.458 --> 14:53.625
Nucleosynthesis.

14:53.667 --> 14:54.834
The structure of the glass

14:54.875 --> 14:56.709
has been altered

14:54.875 --> 14:56.709
at the atomic level.

14:56.750 --> 14:58.291
Problem with

14:56.750 --> 14:58.291
the replicator?

14:58.333 --> 15:00.375
Unlikely.

15:00.417 --> 15:01.625
A problem

15:00.417 --> 15:01.625
with the replicator

15:01.667 --> 15:02.667
would have effected

15:01.667 --> 15:02.667
the contents

15:02.709 --> 15:03.834
as well as the glass

15:03.875 --> 15:05.417
but the liquid in the glass

15:05.458 --> 15:09.375
was a synthehol replication

15:05.458 --> 15:09.375
of a light ale of earth origin

15:09.417 --> 15:12.250
which is, I believe,

15:09.417 --> 15:12.250
what Lieutenant Duffy ordered.

15:12.291 --> 15:14.208
Well, I can't detect

15:12.291 --> 15:14.208
any residual radiation

15:14.250 --> 15:15.750
or any unusual

15:14.250 --> 15:15.750
chemical compounds

15:15.792 --> 15:17.542
that would have

15:15.792 --> 15:17.542
caused this.

15:17.583 --> 15:18.959
The most probable explanation

15:19.000 --> 15:20.959
is that the glass

15:19.000 --> 15:20.959
came into contact

15:21.000 --> 15:22.625
with an unshielded

15:21.000 --> 15:22.625
power source.

15:22.667 --> 15:24.834
Ugh... that means a complete

15:22.667 --> 15:24.834
diagnostic check

15:24.875 --> 15:26.667
of the<i> Enterprise</i>

15:24.875 --> 15:26.667
power systems--

15:26.709 --> 15:29.667
all 4,000 of them.

15:29.709 --> 15:30.875
But do I have the

15:29.709 --> 15:30.875
perfect man for the job.

15:30.917 --> 15:31.875
Hey, Reg.

15:31.917 --> 15:33.709
You busy?

15:33.750 --> 15:34.875
I-I was just...

15:34.917 --> 15:36.375
Uh, no.

15:36.417 --> 15:38.291
Not really.

15:36.417 --> 15:38.291
Why?

15:40.959 --> 15:43.166
Got another mystery for you.

15:43.208 --> 15:46.333
Somehow the molecular structure

15:43.208 --> 15:46.333
of this cup from Ten-Forward

15:46.375 --> 15:48.542
has been altered.

15:48.583 --> 15:49.875
We need to run

15:48.583 --> 15:49.875
through the power systems

15:49.917 --> 15:52.709
to see if there's a leak

15:49.917 --> 15:52.709
that caused this.

15:52.750 --> 15:54.667
I had, uh...

15:54.709 --> 15:56.458
I was going to do that.

15:56.500 --> 15:57.417
You were?

15:57.458 --> 16:00.792
Yes, to try to explain

16:00.834 --> 16:03.417
the antigrav unit failure.

16:03.458 --> 16:05.041
I still can't.

16:05.083 --> 16:08.000
Nothing about it makes sense.

16:08.041 --> 16:11.041
Then it is possible that these

16:08.041 --> 16:11.041
two very disparate incidents

16:11.083 --> 16:12.333
could be related.

16:20.208 --> 16:22.417
I wouldn't bother you with

16:20.208 --> 16:22.417
something this minor, Commander

16:22.458 --> 16:24.375
but it may be a symptom

16:22.458 --> 16:24.375
of a more serious problem.

16:24.417 --> 16:25.959
Do you think we'll need

16:24.417 --> 16:25.959
to put in to a starbase?

16:26.000 --> 16:27.417
We'll have a better idea

16:27.458 --> 16:29.625
after Mr. Barclay runs a check

16:27.458 --> 16:29.625
on the power systems.

16:29.667 --> 16:31.583
It was Lieutenant Barclay

16:29.667 --> 16:31.583
who first suggested

16:31.625 --> 16:33.750
a link between

16:31.625 --> 16:33.750
the two incidents.

16:33.792 --> 16:34.917
What?

16:34.959 --> 16:37.625
No, it wasn't.

16:34.959 --> 16:37.625
I mean, not really.

16:37.667 --> 16:39.250
Will your investigation

16:39.291 --> 16:42.041
affect our available power

16:39.291 --> 16:42.041
during the mission?

16:42.083 --> 16:43.792
No... no, sir.

16:43.834 --> 16:47.750
We'll have to shut off

16:43.834 --> 16:47.750
some systems.

16:47.792 --> 16:50.583
We'll, uh... shut them

16:47.792 --> 16:50.583
down a few at a time.

16:50.625 --> 16:52.250
It shouldn't...

16:52.291 --> 16:53.667
I don't think so.

16:53.709 --> 16:55.583
Good.

16:55.625 --> 16:57.583
I'll look forward

16:55.625 --> 16:57.583
to your report, Mr. Broccoli.

17:01.917 --> 17:03.375
Barclay.

17:04.709 --> 17:06.667
If you will excuse me.

17:13.750 --> 17:15.667
Metathesis is one

17:13.750 --> 17:15.667
of the most common

17:15.709 --> 17:17.083
of pronunciation

17:15.709 --> 17:17.083
errors, sir.

17:17.125 --> 17:19.792
A reversal of vowel

17:17.125 --> 17:19.792
and consonant.

17:19.834 --> 17:21.500
"Barc" to "Broc"...

17:30.875 --> 17:32.166
Yes, I know him.

17:32.208 --> 17:34.875
He comes in.

17:32.208 --> 17:34.875
He stands at the bar.

17:34.917 --> 17:36.250
He doesn't say much.

17:36.291 --> 17:38.208
He orders a warm milk.

17:38.250 --> 17:40.083
(<i> chuckles</i> ):

17:38.250 --> 17:40.083
Figures.

17:40.125 --> 17:42.041
Warm milk helps you sleep,

17:40.125 --> 17:42.041
La Forge.

17:42.083 --> 17:44.083
You should try it.

17:44.125 --> 17:45.792
What's this have to do

17:44.125 --> 17:45.792
with Barclay?

17:45.834 --> 17:47.166
I don't know.

17:47.208 --> 17:50.208
I'm just trying

17:47.208 --> 17:50.208
to figure the man out.

17:50.250 --> 17:51.166
Do you ever talk to him?

17:51.208 --> 17:53.125
He doesn't talk much.

17:53.166 --> 17:54.583
Does he have

17:53.166 --> 17:54.583
any friends?

17:54.625 --> 17:56.291
Not that I've seen.

17:56.333 --> 17:57.834
(<i> sighs</i> )

17:57.875 --> 17:59.709
What do you do

17:57.875 --> 17:59.709
with a guy like that?

17:59.750 --> 18:01.917
Well, I just serve

17:59.750 --> 18:01.917
him warm milk

18:01.959 --> 18:04.542
and let him be.

18:04.583 --> 18:05.625
Yeah, well,

18:04.583 --> 18:05.625
I'm not so lucky.

18:05.667 --> 18:07.333
I can't let him be.

18:07.375 --> 18:09.417
He's my problem.

18:09.458 --> 18:10.792
Hmm.

18:10.834 --> 18:13.834
Well, he's...

18:13.875 --> 18:16.041
imaginative.

18:16.083 --> 18:17.333
How do you know that?

18:17.375 --> 18:18.834
I know.

18:18.875 --> 18:21.917
Well, then maybe he's

18:18.875 --> 18:21.917
in the wrong line of work.

18:21.959 --> 18:23.291
Hmm.

18:23.333 --> 18:25.250
You engineering types

18:25.291 --> 18:27.625
don't appreciate imagination?

18:27.667 --> 18:29.834
That's not it, Guinan.

18:29.875 --> 18:32.709
He just doesn't fit in here.

18:33.959 --> 18:36.291
Oh.

18:36.333 --> 18:37.667
Terkim.

18:37.709 --> 18:39.083
What?

18:39.125 --> 18:41.291
Reminds me of Terkim.

18:41.333 --> 18:43.667
My mother's brother.

18:43.709 --> 18:45.875
Sort of the family misfit.

18:45.917 --> 18:48.291
Everybody told me

18:45.917 --> 18:48.291
to stay away from him.

18:48.333 --> 18:50.458
Bad influence.

18:50.500 --> 18:51.458
Did you?

18:51.500 --> 18:52.959
Are you kidding?

18:53.000 --> 18:54.542
He was the only member

18:53.000 --> 18:54.542
of my family

18:54.583 --> 18:55.959
who had a sense of humor.

18:56.000 --> 18:58.375
Except no one ever stayed

18:56.000 --> 18:58.375
around him long enough

18:58.417 --> 19:00.125
to realize it but me.

19:00.166 --> 19:04.000
My mother tells me I remind her

19:00.166 --> 19:04.000
of him, and I probably do.

19:04.041 --> 19:07.041
The idea of fitting in

19:07.083 --> 19:09.208
just... repels me.

19:10.583 --> 19:13.083
Maybe I'm not

19:10.583 --> 19:13.083
making myself clear, Guinan.

19:13.125 --> 19:14.917
Barclay--

19:14.959 --> 19:17.208
well, he's always late.

19:17.250 --> 19:18.750
The man's nervous.

19:18.792 --> 19:21.083
Nobody wants

19:18.792 --> 19:21.083
to be around this guy.

19:21.125 --> 19:23.959
If I felt that nobody

19:21.125 --> 19:23.959
wanted to be around me

19:24.000 --> 19:26.667
I'd probably be late

19:24.000 --> 19:26.667
and nervous, too.

19:26.709 --> 19:28.333
Guinan, that's not the point.

19:28.375 --> 19:30.083
Are you sure?

19:31.959 --> 19:33.834
Excuse me.

19:39.083 --> 19:42.125
Computer,

19:39.083 --> 19:42.125
where is Lieutenant Barclay?

19:52.166 --> 19:54.333
(<i> birds singing</i> )

19:54.375 --> 19:56.583
(<i> holodeck doors close</i> )

20:01.333 --> 20:02.750
Reg?

20:16.542 --> 20:17.792
Beverly?

20:17.834 --> 20:20.000
Good morning, milord.

20:20.041 --> 20:22.709
Manners, my son, manners.

20:22.750 --> 20:24.333
You embarrass me

20:22.750 --> 20:24.333
before our guest.

20:24.375 --> 20:28.291
Master Barclay

20:24.375 --> 20:28.291
will spank you

20:24.375 --> 20:28.291
if you misbehave.

20:28.333 --> 20:29.917
Wesley?

20:29.959 --> 20:31.959
What do<i> you</i> want?

20:32.000 --> 20:35.792
Well, I guess

20:32.000 --> 20:35.792
I want<i> Master</i> Barclay.

20:35.834 --> 20:39.083
The boys got into another

20:35.834 --> 20:39.083
little scrap, I'm afraid

20:39.125 --> 20:40.959
but boys will be boys.

20:41.000 --> 20:43.709
(<i> swords clashing,</i>

20:41.000 --> 20:43.709
<i>men grunting</i> )

20:52.667 --> 20:54.750
You cannot withstand our

20:52.667 --> 20:54.750
assault forever, Barclay.

20:54.792 --> 20:55.750
Ah!

20:55.792 --> 20:57.625
Ha!

21:03.917 --> 21:05.875
DATA:

21:03.917 --> 21:05.875
You are outnumbered,

21:03.917 --> 21:05.875
Mr. Barclay.

21:05.917 --> 21:07.917
Say you will yield,

21:05.917 --> 21:07.917
and it ends here.

21:07.959 --> 21:10.667
I shall speak

21:07.959 --> 21:10.667
with my sword, sir.

21:14.250 --> 21:16.500
Ha!

21:37.667 --> 21:38.959
In God's name

21:39.000 --> 21:40.709
where did you learn

21:39.000 --> 21:40.709
to fight like this?

21:40.750 --> 21:43.000
Self-taught,

21:40.750 --> 21:43.000
my<i> Capitaine.</i>

21:43.041 --> 21:44.917
Shall I give you

21:43.041 --> 21:44.917
a few lessons?

21:54.208 --> 21:55.250
PICARD:

21:54.208 --> 21:55.250
Who is that?

21:55.291 --> 21:56.917
One of your allies?

21:56.959 --> 21:58.583
Oh, Jean-Luc

21:58.625 --> 21:59.834
not that old trick.

21:59.875 --> 22:01.917
I'm very disappointed in you.

22:01.959 --> 22:03.834
(<i> clears throat</i> )

22:10.709 --> 22:12.834
I'll make it easy

22:10.709 --> 22:12.834
for you, Commander.

22:12.875 --> 22:14.792
I will request

22:12.875 --> 22:14.792
a reassignment.

22:14.834 --> 22:16.291
Now, wait...

22:14.834 --> 22:16.291
Look, we both know--

22:16.333 --> 22:19.041
The whole ship knows...

22:19.083 --> 22:21.959
I... I just can't

22:19.083 --> 22:21.959
cut it here.

22:22.000 --> 22:23.458
Hey, Barclay

22:23.500 --> 22:26.000
I've spent a few hours

22:23.500 --> 22:26.000
on the holodeck, too, you know.

22:26.041 --> 22:27.417
Now, as far

22:26.041 --> 22:27.417
as I'm concerned

22:27.458 --> 22:31.417
what you do in the holodeck

22:27.458 --> 22:31.417
is your own business

22:31.458 --> 22:34.208
as long as it doesn't

22:31.458 --> 22:34.208
interfere with your work.

22:34.250 --> 22:35.959
So you're...

22:36.041 --> 22:38.709
you're not going to

22:36.041 --> 22:38.709
tell anyone about this?

22:38.750 --> 22:40.000
I don't think everybody

22:40.041 --> 22:43.291
would appreciate

22:40.041 --> 22:43.291
your imagination like I do.

22:48.750 --> 22:49.959
It is kind of unusual

22:50.000 --> 22:52.291
recreating people

22:50.000 --> 22:52.291
you already know.

22:54.375 --> 22:55.834
Well, it was just...

22:58.917 --> 23:02.542
I needed to blow

22:58.917 --> 23:02.542
off some steam

23:03.750 --> 23:06.417
because one...

23:03.750 --> 23:06.417
one of the officers

23:06.458 --> 23:09.625
had been getting

23:06.458 --> 23:09.625
on my back.

23:09.667 --> 23:11.500
Let me guess.

23:11.542 --> 23:13.125
(<i> laughs</i> )

23:13.166 --> 23:14.333
It was you.

23:14.375 --> 23:16.083
And I just couldn't tell you

23:16.125 --> 23:18.458
what I wanted to tell you

23:16.125 --> 23:18.458
to your face

23:18.500 --> 23:21.166
so it just sort

23:18.500 --> 23:21.166
of got out of control.

23:22.458 --> 23:24.250
I don't know, there's a part of

23:22.458 --> 23:24.250
this

23:24.291 --> 23:27.125
that's kind of therapeutic.

23:27.166 --> 23:28.959
Maybe you ought to talk

23:27.166 --> 23:28.959
to Counselor Troi about it.

23:30.333 --> 23:32.375
It's, it's... I'm ...

23:32.417 --> 23:35.375
when I'm in there,

23:32.417 --> 23:35.375
I'm just more comfortable.

23:35.417 --> 23:38.959
You don't know what a struggle

23:35.417 --> 23:38.959
this has been for me, Commander.

23:39.000 --> 23:41.291
Well, I'd like to help if I can.

23:41.333 --> 23:43.041
Being afraid

23:41.333 --> 23:43.041
all of the time

23:43.083 --> 23:45.834
of forgetting somebody's name

23:45.875 --> 23:49.834
not... not knowing what to do

23:45.875 --> 23:49.834
with your hands.

23:49.875 --> 23:53.750
I mean, I am the guy

23:49.875 --> 23:53.750
who writes down

23:53.792 --> 23:56.959
things to remember to say

23:53.792 --> 23:56.959
when there's a party.

23:57.000 --> 23:58.792
And then when he

23:57.000 --> 23:58.792
finally gets there

23:58.834 --> 24:01.583
he winds up alone,

24:01.625 --> 24:03.250
in the corner

24:03.291 --> 24:05.208
trying to look

24:03.291 --> 24:05.208
comfortable

24:05.250 --> 24:07.834
examining a potted plant.

24:07.875 --> 24:09.709
You're just shy, Barclay.

24:12.125 --> 24:15.166
"Just shy."

24:15.208 --> 24:18.583
sounds like nothing serious,

24:15.208 --> 24:18.583
doesn't it?

24:20.083 --> 24:23.041
You can't know.

24:23.083 --> 24:25.166
O'Brien to La Forge.

24:25.208 --> 24:26.583
Go ahead.

24:26.625 --> 24:29.208
I need you in transporter

24:26.625 --> 24:29.208
room three, Commander.

24:30.500 --> 24:31.834
On my way, Chief.

24:34.458 --> 24:36.792
Listen, Reg.

24:36.834 --> 24:39.458
I really do want you

24:36.834 --> 24:39.458
to talk to Counselor Troi.

24:39.500 --> 24:41.625
Troi?

24:41.667 --> 24:42.834
No, no, no, no, no.

24:41.667 --> 24:42.834
I... I couldn't.

24:42.875 --> 24:44.291
I mean it.

24:44.333 --> 24:47.250
As your friend

24:44.333 --> 24:47.250
and as your commanding officer.

24:52.917 --> 24:55.792
I was synchronizing

24:52.917 --> 24:55.792
the phase transition coils.

24:55.834 --> 24:59.125
I didn't do anything

24:55.834 --> 24:59.125
I haven't done 100 times before.

24:59.166 --> 25:01.834
The test object

24:59.166 --> 25:01.834
is made of pure duranium.

25:01.875 --> 25:03.917
Seems normal

25:01.875 --> 25:03.917
enough to me.

25:03.959 --> 25:05.375
Watch this.

25:27.083 --> 25:29.542
Glad I don't have

25:27.083 --> 25:29.542
anywhere to go.

25:32.834 --> 25:36.625
LA FORGE:

25:32.834 --> 25:36.625
<i>Chief Engineer's log,</i>

25:32.834 --> 25:36.625
<i>Stardate 43808.2.</i>

<i>A systems analysis</i>

25:38.542 --> 25:40.291

25:40.333 --> 25:42.792

25:40.333 --> 25:42.792

25:42.834 --> 25:44.000
This part of the same pattern?

25:44.041 --> 25:45.875
We don't know, sir.

25:45.917 --> 25:47.875
And we don't know why

25:45.917 --> 25:47.875
only transporter room

25:45.917 --> 25:47.875
three is affected.

25:47.917 --> 25:49.583
None of the other transporter

25:47.917 --> 25:49.583
rooms are malfunctioning.

25:49.625 --> 25:51.166
Yet.

25:51.208 --> 25:52.667
We reach Nahmi IV in 22 hours.

25:52.709 --> 25:54.875
We'll want all transporters

25:52.709 --> 25:54.875
operational by then.

25:54.917 --> 25:57.250
I want a level-1 diagnostic

25:57.291 --> 25:59.375
across the board.

25:59.417 --> 26:01.667
Advise Mr. Barclay to join us

25:59.417 --> 26:01.667
on the bridge immediately.

26:01.709 --> 26:04.250
Oh, can we make

26:01.709 --> 26:04.250
that 1400 hours, sir?

26:04.291 --> 26:05.667
I've got him working

26:04.291 --> 26:05.667
on something.

26:05.709 --> 26:07.458
1400 hours.

26:07.500 --> 26:09.333
Mr. O'brien, no maintenance

26:07.500 --> 26:09.333
on the transporter

26:09.375 --> 26:10.458
until further notice.

26:10.500 --> 26:11.709
Aye, sir.

26:14.041 --> 26:17.583
I know this is

26:14.041 --> 26:17.583
difficult for you.

26:17.625 --> 26:19.875
Is there anything I can do

26:17.625 --> 26:19.875
to make you more comfortable?

26:19.917 --> 26:23.458
No.

26:23.500 --> 26:26.625
Have you ever been

26:23.500 --> 26:26.625
with a counselor before?

26:26.667 --> 26:28.125
Yes... no.

26:28.166 --> 26:29.542
Which one?

26:30.792 --> 26:33.417
Yes, but she, uh...

26:34.792 --> 26:37.583
It-it wasn't...

26:37.625 --> 26:39.500
it wasn't really a counselor.

26:41.750 --> 26:45.500
Most people find a counselor

26:41.750 --> 26:45.500
intimidating at first.

26:47.000 --> 26:51.000
It's okay if you feel

26:47.000 --> 26:51.000
that way toward me.

26:51.041 --> 26:53.792
Not... at all.

26:53.834 --> 26:55.583
Good.

26:55.625 --> 26:57.875
Now, lean back,

26:57.917 --> 27:00.500
close your eyes...

27:00.542 --> 27:02.333
Why?

27:02.375 --> 27:04.500
I want to make you

27:02.375 --> 27:04.500
more comfortable.

27:04.542 --> 27:06.625
You do?

27:06.667 --> 27:08.166
Yes.

27:15.375 --> 27:18.333
It's okay.

27:18.375 --> 27:19.625
Close your eyes.

27:19.667 --> 27:22.000
What are you

27:19.667 --> 27:22.000
going to do?

27:22.041 --> 27:25.208
Just listen to the sound

27:22.041 --> 27:25.208
of my voice.

27:25.250 --> 27:28.875
Take a slow, deep breath

27:25.250 --> 27:28.875
in through your nose...

27:31.959 --> 27:35.583
... and let it out through

27:31.959 --> 27:35.583
your mouth just as slowly.

27:40.583 --> 27:43.542
That's better, isn't it?

27:43.583 --> 27:45.709
Much better.

27:45.750 --> 27:48.083
Oh, yes.

27:48.125 --> 27:50.583
Oh, yes, that's...

27:48.125 --> 27:50.583
that's much better.

27:50.625 --> 27:52.667
That... that...

27:50.625 --> 27:52.667
that is extremely helpful.

27:52.709 --> 27:53.875
Thank you

27:52.709 --> 27:53.875
for your time.

27:53.917 --> 27:56.500
But...

27:53.917 --> 27:56.500
Really, that's

27:53.917 --> 27:56.500
very helpful.

27:56.542 --> 27:58.834
In through the nose

27:58.875 --> 28:00.792
out through the mouth.

28:00.834 --> 28:04.041
I'm going to practice that

28:00.834 --> 28:04.041
and I'll-I'll let you know.

28:04.083 --> 28:05.333
Thank you again.

28:07.083 --> 28:08.625
Whoa...oh

28:20.375 --> 28:22.583
I had a very

28:20.375 --> 28:22.583
strange visit

28:22.625 --> 28:24.792
from one of your

28:22.625 --> 28:24.792
officers today.

28:24.834 --> 28:26.208
Barclay?

28:26.250 --> 28:27.792
Yeah, I can imagine.

28:27.834 --> 28:30.375
Were you able to do

28:27.834 --> 28:30.375
anything for him?

28:30.417 --> 28:32.917
To be honest I'm not

28:30.417 --> 28:32.917
sure what happened.

28:34.667 --> 28:36.458
Where is Mr. Barclay?

28:36.500 --> 28:37.750
It's past 1400 hours.

28:39.250 --> 28:43.250
Lieutenant Barclay,

28:39.250 --> 28:43.250
report to the bridge.

28:43.291 --> 28:44.709
Lieutenant Barclay, report.

28:47.041 --> 28:49.834
Computer,

28:47.041 --> 28:49.834
locate Lieutenant Barclay.

28:49.875 --> 28:52.041
COMPUTER: Lieutenant Barclay

28:49.875 --> 28:52.041
is in holodeck two.

28:54.542 --> 28:55.625
(<i> sighs</i> ):

28:54.542 --> 28:55.625
I'll get him.

28:55.667 --> 28:56.792
No, I'll

28:55.667 --> 28:56.792
handle this.

28:56.834 --> 28:58.125
I've had it with him.

28:58.166 --> 29:00.041
Counselor, you'd

28:58.166 --> 29:00.041
better come along.

29:06.333 --> 29:07.875
I think

29:06.333 --> 29:07.875
you should know

29:07.917 --> 29:10.000
Barclay's been running

29:07.917 --> 29:10.000
some unique programs.

29:11.834 --> 29:14.166
I don't care

29:11.834 --> 29:14.166
what he's been running.

29:14.208 --> 29:16.000
I just ran out of patience.

29:19.041 --> 29:21.208
(<i> birds singing</i> )

29:24.834 --> 29:28.667
(<i> men laughing in the distance</i> )

29:28.709 --> 29:30.083
(<i> holodeck door closes</i> )

29:33.500 --> 29:35.250
PICARD:

29:33.500 --> 29:35.250
...before our swords.

29:35.291 --> 29:36.250
MEN:

29:35.291 --> 29:36.250
Hear, hear.

29:36.291 --> 29:37.792
(<i> laughter</i> )

29:37.834 --> 29:39.834
PICARD:

29:37.834 --> 29:39.834
I hope she was worth

29:37.834 --> 29:39.834
the effort.

29:39.875 --> 29:41.250
GEORDIE:

29:39.875 --> 29:41.250
Oh. Show us how you did it.

29:41.291 --> 29:43.041
DATA:

29:41.291 --> 29:43.041
Like this!

29:43.083 --> 29:44.333
Ah!

29:57.041 --> 29:58.291
Like I said, Commander

29:58.333 --> 30:01.500
Barclay's been running

29:58.333 --> 30:01.500
some unusual programs.

30:01.542 --> 30:03.166
This is a violation

30:01.542 --> 30:03.166
of protocol.

30:03.208 --> 30:06.208
Crewmembers should not be

30:03.208 --> 30:06.208
simulated in the holodeck.

30:06.250 --> 30:07.333
LA FORGE:

30:06.250 --> 30:07.333
Commander, I don't

30:06.250 --> 30:07.333
think there's any

30:07.375 --> 30:08.500
regulation against...

30:08.542 --> 30:10.375
Well, there ought to be.

30:10.417 --> 30:12.250
Computer, discontinue

30:10.417 --> 30:12.250
program and erase.

30:12.291 --> 30:14.500
Computer, belay that order.

30:14.542 --> 30:16.000
Counselor?

30:16.041 --> 30:19.625
If Barclay is having

30:16.041 --> 30:19.625
difficulty facing reality

30:19.667 --> 30:22.417
to suddenly destroy

30:19.667 --> 30:22.417
his only means of escape

30:22.458 --> 30:23.500
would be brutal

30:23.542 --> 30:26.125
and could do

30:23.542 --> 30:26.125
considerable damage.

30:26.166 --> 30:29.834
They are quite disagreeable,

30:26.166 --> 30:29.834
aren't they?

30:29.875 --> 30:31.125
Mmm.

30:33.583 --> 30:37.166
Shall we...

30:33.583 --> 30:37.166
have at them?

30:37.208 --> 30:39.709
Delighted!

30:39.750 --> 30:41.250
GEORDIE:

30:39.750 --> 30:41.250
We shall thrash them.

30:41.291 --> 30:42.250
En garde!

30:42.291 --> 30:43.208
Stop it.

30:43.250 --> 30:44.250
Put that down.

30:44.291 --> 30:45.667
Your sword, sir.

30:47.625 --> 30:49.208
I don't have a sword.

30:49.250 --> 30:51.667
How do you expect to fight

30:49.250 --> 30:51.667
without your sword, sir?

30:51.709 --> 30:54.458
I don't expect to fight.

30:54.500 --> 30:55.583
Ha!

30:55.625 --> 30:58.417
Do I detect

30:55.625 --> 30:58.417
a streak of yellow

30:58.458 --> 31:01.000
along the good

30:58.458 --> 31:01.000
fellow's back?

31:01.041 --> 31:04.250
(<i> laughing</i> )

31:04.291 --> 31:06.000
Perhaps we should supply

31:06.041 --> 31:08.500
a more appropriate

31:06.041 --> 31:08.500
adversary for him.

31:08.542 --> 31:09.542
GEORDIE:

31:08.542 --> 31:09.542
Aha, indeed.

31:09.583 --> 31:10.709
Number one?

31:10.750 --> 31:11.792
Number one!

31:11.834 --> 31:13.375
RIKER:

31:11.834 --> 31:13.375
Here I come.

31:15.583 --> 31:16.542
Am I late?

31:16.583 --> 31:18.583
Did I miss the fight?

31:18.625 --> 31:19.750
En garde!

31:19.792 --> 31:22.291
You, sir, you have

31:19.792 --> 31:22.291
a familiar bearing.

31:22.333 --> 31:25.208
Is it possible our swords

31:22.333 --> 31:25.208
have crossed somewhere before?

31:25.250 --> 31:26.709
Where is he?

31:26.750 --> 31:29.291
Where's Barclay?

31:29.333 --> 31:31.583
Aha! A personal grudge.

31:31.625 --> 31:34.083
I warn you, it would

31:31.625 --> 31:34.083
be wise for you

31:34.125 --> 31:35.792
to put your affairs

31:34.125 --> 31:35.792
in final order

31:35.834 --> 31:37.709
before you meet him

31:35.834 --> 31:37.709
in combat.

31:37.750 --> 31:40.000
You challenge

31:37.750 --> 31:40.000
the greatest sword...

31:40.041 --> 31:41.291
In all the holodeck.

31:41.333 --> 31:43.083
(<i> stifles laughter</i> )

31:44.709 --> 31:45.959
You think this is funny?

31:46.000 --> 31:47.583
You<i> are</i> very tall.

31:47.625 --> 31:49.625
It might be threatening

31:47.625 --> 31:49.625
to some people.

31:51.875 --> 31:54.166
Mr. Barclay will find out

31:51.875 --> 31:54.166
what it means to be threatened.

31:54.208 --> 31:57.208
Computer,

31:54.208 --> 31:57.208
discontinue image of Riker.

31:59.000 --> 32:00.583
Sir!

32:00.625 --> 32:02.959
You have no sense of fair play.

32:03.000 --> 32:05.000
Just tell us

32:03.000 --> 32:05.000
where to find Barclay.

32:12.834 --> 32:14.917
You want us to

32:12.834 --> 32:14.917
search through all

32:12.834 --> 32:14.917
this to find him?

32:14.959 --> 32:17.875
It could provide us

32:14.959 --> 32:17.875
with valuable information

32:17.917 --> 32:19.500
about what's troubling him.

32:21.333 --> 32:24.041
You know, there's nothing wrong

32:21.333 --> 32:24.041
with a healthy fantasy life

32:24.083 --> 32:25.959
as long as you

32:24.083 --> 32:25.959
don't let it take over.

32:26.000 --> 32:27.500
You call this healthy?

32:27.542 --> 32:29.792
You're taking it

32:27.542 --> 32:29.792
so seriously.

32:29.834 --> 32:32.333
It's not without

32:29.834 --> 32:32.333
its element of humor.

32:32.375 --> 32:33.834
I am the goddess

32:33.875 --> 32:35.959
of empathy.

32:36.000 --> 32:38.333
Cast off your inhibitions

32:38.375 --> 32:40.500
and embrace love

32:40.542 --> 32:43.583
truth, joy.

32:43.625 --> 32:45.667
Oh... my... God.

32:45.709 --> 32:48.792
Discard your facades

32:45.709 --> 32:48.792
and reveal

32:48.834 --> 32:50.667
your true being to me.

32:50.709 --> 32:51.709
Computer, discontinue...

32:51.750 --> 32:54.291
Computer, belay

32:51.750 --> 32:54.291
that order.

32:54.333 --> 32:55.959
We want to get

32:54.333 --> 32:55.959
more insight

32:54.333 --> 32:55.959
into what's

32:56.000 --> 32:57.959
been troubling this

32:56.000 --> 32:57.959
poor man, remember?

33:00.625 --> 33:01.792
Quite a healthy

33:00.625 --> 33:01.792
fantasy life

33:01.834 --> 33:02.959
wouldn't you say?

33:03.000 --> 33:04.208
Mmm.

33:07.458 --> 33:08.792
(<i> rumbling</i> )

33:08.834 --> 33:10.750
(<i> console beeping</i> )

33:10.792 --> 33:12.291
Report.

33:12.333 --> 33:15.208
WORF:

33:12.333 --> 33:15.208
Sir, our velocity

33:12.333 --> 33:15.208
increased to warp 7.25.

33:15.250 --> 33:16.500
Compensating, sir.

33:18.041 --> 33:19.125
Confirmed.

33:19.166 --> 33:20.625
Velocity now warp seven.

33:23.041 --> 33:25.375
Maintain that.

33:25.417 --> 33:26.583
What the hell happened?

33:26.625 --> 33:28.291
The matter/anti-matter

33:26.625 --> 33:28.291
injectors locked

33:28.333 --> 33:29.458
for a split second.

33:29.500 --> 33:30.667
I am not certain why, sir.

33:30.709 --> 33:33.208
They appear to be

33:30.709 --> 33:33.208
working normally now.

33:33.250 --> 33:34.291
Picard to La Forge.

33:34.333 --> 33:35.917
LA FORGE: Go ahead,

33:34.333 --> 33:35.917
Captain.

33:35.959 --> 33:38.291
Commander, any explanation

33:35.959 --> 33:38.291
for this injector problem?

33:38.333 --> 33:41.166
Well, um, I'm not

33:38.333 --> 33:41.166
in engineering, sir.

33:41.208 --> 33:42.500
I'm in holodeck two.

33:42.542 --> 33:44.667
PICARD:

33:42.542 --> 33:44.667
Another malfunction?

33:44.709 --> 33:48.083
Not exactly, but I'll

33:44.709 --> 33:48.083
return to engineering

33:44.709 --> 33:48.083
immediately, sir.

33:48.125 --> 33:50.583
Yes, I should say

33:48.125 --> 33:50.583
that you should, Commander.

33:50.625 --> 33:52.583
Your holodeck activities

33:50.625 --> 33:52.583
can wait until later.

33:52.625 --> 33:53.542
And, Commander...

33:53.583 --> 33:55.000
Yes, sir.

33:55.041 --> 33:57.083
It would be wise to consult

33:55.041 --> 33:57.083
Lieutenant Barclay

33:57.125 --> 33:58.458
on this latest incident.

33:58.500 --> 33:59.959
I'd like to

33:58.500 --> 33:59.959
very much, Captain.

34:00.000 --> 34:01.208
La Forge out.

34:02.417 --> 34:05.208
We need to find

34:02.417 --> 34:05.208
Barclay<i> now.</i>

34:05.250 --> 34:08.291
Cast aside your masks

34:08.333 --> 34:10.959
and let me slip into your minds.

34:14.083 --> 34:15.542
Muzzle it.

34:21.709 --> 34:24.458
(<i> loud snoring</i> )

34:29.208 --> 34:30.667
Shh.

34:40.041 --> 34:43.417
We have a lot to talk

34:40.041 --> 34:43.417
about, Mr. Barclay.

34:43.458 --> 34:44.625
Commander,

34:43.458 --> 34:44.625
Barclay and I

34:44.667 --> 34:45.834
had better get

34:44.667 --> 34:45.834
to engineering.

34:45.875 --> 34:47.291
Dismissed.

34:52.500 --> 34:54.583
I just couldn't

34:52.500 --> 34:54.583
keep my eyes open.

34:54.625 --> 34:56.667
I'd worked 12 hours

34:54.625 --> 34:56.667
on the power systems

34:56.709 --> 34:58.667
and then... then the

34:56.709 --> 34:58.667
transporter went down.

34:58.709 --> 35:00.625
Reg, you had a chance

34:58.709 --> 35:00.625
to get some help

35:00.667 --> 35:02.125
from the real

35:00.667 --> 35:02.125
Counselor Troi

35:02.166 --> 35:04.041
but, instead, you

35:02.166 --> 35:04.041
went back in there.

35:04.083 --> 35:05.375
I know.

35:04.083 --> 35:05.375
I didn't want to.

35:05.417 --> 35:07.041
I just couldn't

35:05.417 --> 35:07.041
help myself.

35:07.083 --> 35:10.000
You're going to be

35:07.083 --> 35:10.000
able to write the

35:07.083 --> 35:10.000
book on holodiction.

35:10.041 --> 35:11.083
Look, I know

35:10.041 --> 35:11.083
how easy it is

35:11.125 --> 35:12.291
to get caught

35:11.125 --> 35:12.291
up in it.

35:12.333 --> 35:13.709
I fell in love

35:12.333 --> 35:13.709
in there once.

35:13.750 --> 35:15.375
Really?

35:13.750 --> 35:15.375
But I knew when

35:13.750 --> 35:15.375
it was time

35:15.417 --> 35:16.583
to turn it off

35:15.417 --> 35:16.583
and say good-bye.

35:16.625 --> 35:17.959
It wasn't easy,

35:16.625 --> 35:17.959
but I did it.

35:18.000 --> 35:21.375
You know, the people

35:18.000 --> 35:21.375
that I create in there

35:21.417 --> 35:23.625
are more real to me

35:23.667 --> 35:25.875
than anyone I meet out here.

35:25.917 --> 35:27.291
Except...

35:27.333 --> 35:30.750
maybe you,

35:27.333 --> 35:30.750
Commander.

35:30.792 --> 35:34.625
I need you

35:30.792 --> 35:34.625
out here, Reg.

35:34.667 --> 35:36.125
Now more than ever.

35:36.166 --> 35:37.458
Huh?

35:44.709 --> 35:47.583
The injectors aren't responding

35:44.709 --> 35:47.583
to the diagnostic commands.

35:47.625 --> 35:50.875
I think we should

35:47.625 --> 35:50.875
drop out of warp.

35:50.917 --> 35:52.041
La Forge to bridge.

35:52.083 --> 35:53.583
Go ahead, Commander.

35:53.625 --> 35:55.875
Recommend we go

35:53.625 --> 35:55.875
to impulse power, Captain.

35:55.917 --> 35:57.166
Take us out of warp.

35:59.709 --> 36:01.166
Controls are not

35:59.709 --> 36:01.166
responding, sir.

36:01.208 --> 36:02.166
It's the injectors.

36:02.208 --> 36:03.125
Override.

36:03.166 --> 36:05.750
It's not

36:03.166 --> 36:05.750
a computer problem.

36:05.792 --> 36:07.959
The mechanism is

36:05.792 --> 36:07.959
physically jammed.

36:08.000 --> 36:09.834
I can't clear it.

36:09.875 --> 36:12.208
Speed increasing, sir.

36:12.250 --> 36:13.750
Warp 7.6.

36:13.792 --> 36:15.709
7.65.

36:15.750 --> 36:17.125
Warp 7.7.

36:21.250 --> 36:23.333
We can't shut it

36:21.250 --> 36:23.333
down, Captain.

36:23.375 --> 36:25.000
Anti-matter flow

36:23.375 --> 36:25.000
is... increasing.

36:25.041 --> 36:27.125
She's accelerating

36:25.041 --> 36:27.125
out of control.

36:27.166 --> 36:28.959
There's nothing I can do.

36:38.583 --> 36:40.041
Approaching

36:38.583 --> 36:40.041
warp nine, sir.

36:40.083 --> 36:41.875
Red alert.

36:41.917 --> 36:44.041
Estimated time

36:41.917 --> 36:44.041
to structural failure?

36:44.083 --> 36:47.291
At this rate of acceleration--

36:44.083 --> 36:47.291
15 minutes, 40 seconds, sir.

36:47.333 --> 36:48.667
Did you copy that, Geordi?

36:48.709 --> 36:49.709
Aye, Commander.

36:49.750 --> 36:50.959
Recommendations?

36:51.000 --> 36:52.125
I'll let you know

36:51.000 --> 36:52.125
as soon as we have some.

36:52.166 --> 36:53.709
La Forge out.

36:53.750 --> 36:55.083
Okay, this ship

36:53.750 --> 36:55.083
is going to start

36:55.125 --> 36:56.917
tearing itself apart

36:55.125 --> 36:56.917
in 15 minutes.

36:56.959 --> 36:59.750
I want every idea on the table,

36:56.959 --> 36:59.750
I don't care how outrageous.

36:59.792 --> 37:01.417
What about attempting

36:59.792 --> 37:01.417
a magnetic quench

37:01.458 --> 37:02.750
on the fusion

37:01.458 --> 37:02.750
pre-burners?

37:02.792 --> 37:03.917
No, I already tried that.

37:03.959 --> 37:05.625
The magnetic fields won't reset.

37:05.667 --> 37:07.417
Could the fuel inlet servos

37:05.667 --> 37:07.417
be caught in cycle?

37:07.458 --> 37:08.792
If they were,

37:07.458 --> 37:08.792
the swirl dampers

37:08.834 --> 37:10.333
would be frozen, too,

37:08.834 --> 37:10.333
and they aren't.

37:10.375 --> 37:13.000
Nothing showed up

37:10.375 --> 37:13.000
in the diagnostic sweep, at all?

37:13.041 --> 37:14.291
The tests showed

37:13.041 --> 37:14.291
there were proble...

37:14.333 --> 37:15.750
I mean, there were

37:14.333 --> 37:15.750
<i>no</i> problems

37:15.792 --> 37:17.542
with the fl-flow...

37:15.792 --> 37:17.542
the flow of the...

37:17.583 --> 37:19.625
There's nothing wrong

37:17.583 --> 37:19.625
with the computer

37:17.583 --> 37:19.625
control protocols

37:19.667 --> 37:21.041
or the power

37:19.667 --> 37:21.041
transfer systems.

37:21.083 --> 37:22.625
As far as we can

37:21.083 --> 37:22.625
determine the injectors

37:22.667 --> 37:24.500
are just

37:22.667 --> 37:24.500
physically jammed.

37:24.542 --> 37:27.083
Injectors freeze,

37:24.542 --> 37:27.083
antigrav unit goes down

37:27.125 --> 37:28.500
transporter malfunctions...

37:28.542 --> 37:29.750
And a twisted glass.

37:29.792 --> 37:30.792
What's the connection?

37:30.834 --> 37:32.583
(<i> rumbling</i> )

37:34.959 --> 37:37.250
Exceeding warp 9.4.

37:37.291 --> 37:40.041
Begin evacuation

37:37.291 --> 37:40.041
of secondary hull.

37:40.083 --> 37:43.792
Prepare for emergency

37:40.083 --> 37:43.792
saucer separation.

37:43.834 --> 37:46.417
Standing by to release

37:43.834 --> 37:46.417
docking clamps.

37:46.458 --> 37:48.458
Re-route systems

37:46.458 --> 37:48.458
to primary hull power sources.

37:48.500 --> 37:52.417
The plasma flow to the nacelles

37:48.500 --> 37:52.417
is uneven due to injector lock.

37:52.458 --> 37:55.208
An emergency saucer separation

37:52.458 --> 37:55.208
could rupture the warp field.

37:55.250 --> 37:58.834
(<i> rumbling</i> )

37:58.875 --> 38:00.458
(<i> console beeping insistently</i> )

38:00.500 --> 38:02.875
12 minutes

38:00.500 --> 38:02.875
to structural failure, sir.

38:05.792 --> 38:06.917
None of the

38:05.792 --> 38:06.917
systems involved

38:06.959 --> 38:08.125
interact directly

38:06.959 --> 38:08.125
with each other.

38:08.166 --> 38:09.583
I don't see

38:08.166 --> 38:09.583
anything in common.

38:09.625 --> 38:10.792
Wh-what if... what if...

38:10.834 --> 38:13.083
what if one of us

38:10.834 --> 38:13.083
<i>is</i> the connection?

38:13.125 --> 38:14.625
Us? How?

38:14.667 --> 38:16.291
I don't know.

38:16.333 --> 38:20.333
But we're looking

38:16.333 --> 38:20.333
for a systemic explanation

38:20.375 --> 38:22.333
and there isn't one.

38:22.375 --> 38:25.041
I mean, we work with

38:22.375 --> 38:25.041
all of the systems

38:22.375 --> 38:25.041
that are affected.

38:25.083 --> 38:26.834
What if...

38:26.875 --> 38:30.291
what if we're transmitting

38:26.875 --> 38:30.291
something ourselves...

38:30.333 --> 38:32.500
by touching it, or something?

38:32.542 --> 38:34.750
The computer would have

38:32.542 --> 38:34.750
picked up anything dangerous.

38:34.792 --> 38:36.625
But... if it were something,

38:36.667 --> 38:39.333
something that

38:36.667 --> 38:39.333
we<i> couldn't</i> scan

38:39.375 --> 38:40.917
you might have passed it on

38:40.959 --> 38:42.500
to the injectors

38:40.959 --> 38:42.500
when you were re-aligning

38:42.542 --> 38:44.041
the magnetic capacitors.

38:44.083 --> 38:46.041
It was your glass, Duffy,

38:44.083 --> 38:46.041
and both of you were present

38:46.083 --> 38:47.458
in the cargo bay

38:46.083 --> 38:47.458
when the antigrav failed.

38:47.500 --> 38:49.083
Well, so was O'Brien.

38:49.125 --> 38:51.125
The transporter malfunction--

38:49.125 --> 38:51.125
that's a connection, too.

38:51.166 --> 38:53.083
(<i> alarm beeps loudly</i> )

Computer,

list all physical substances

38:58.041 --> 39:00.625
that wouldn't normally be

38:58.041 --> 39:00.625
picked up by an internal scan.

39:00.667 --> 39:03.959
There are 15,525

39:00.667 --> 39:03.959
known substances

39:04.000 --> 39:05.583
that cannot be detected

39:05.625 --> 39:07.333
by standard scans.

39:07.375 --> 39:10.333
Great, and how many of those can

39:07.375 --> 39:10.333
exist in an oxygen atmosphere?

39:10.375 --> 39:12.125
Five hundred thirty-two.

39:12.166 --> 39:13.917
<i>And</i> could alter

39:12.166 --> 39:13.917
molecular structure

39:13.959 --> 39:16.458
when it comes in contact with...

39:13.959 --> 39:16.458
with glass?

39:16.500 --> 39:17.542
Five.

39:17.583 --> 39:19.083
On screen at this station.

39:19.125 --> 39:20.875
Duffy.

39:23.041 --> 39:25.750
BARCLAY:

39:23.041 --> 39:25.750
Jakmanite has a half-life

39:23.041 --> 39:25.750
of 15 seconds.

39:25.792 --> 39:28.250
There wouldn't be enough time

39:25.792 --> 39:28.250
to spread it around the ship.

39:25.792 --> 39:28.250
Right.

39:28.291 --> 39:31.083
Selgninaem and lucrovexitrin

39:28.291 --> 39:31.083
are highly toxic.

39:31.125 --> 39:32.333
Yeah, we'd all be dead by now.

39:32.375 --> 39:34.667
That leaves...

39:32.375 --> 39:34.667
saltzgadum and invidium.

39:34.709 --> 39:36.458
Neither of which has been used

39:34.709 --> 39:36.458
for decades.

39:36.500 --> 39:39.166
But could either one of them

39:36.500 --> 39:39.166
cause all these malfunctions?

39:39.208 --> 39:41.125
Most of the affected systems

39:39.208 --> 39:41.125
weren't even invented

39:41.166 --> 39:42.542
when those substances

39:41.166 --> 39:42.542
were in use.

39:42.583 --> 39:43.959
Who knows what could happen

39:44.000 --> 39:45.875
with a transporter

39:44.000 --> 39:45.875
or a magnetic capacitor.

39:45.917 --> 39:47.542
Wait a minute,

39:45.917 --> 39:47.542
wasn't invidium used

39:47.583 --> 39:48.709
in medical containment fields?

39:48.750 --> 39:50.208
Not for over a century.

39:50.250 --> 39:52.417
The Mikulaks

39:50.250 --> 39:52.417
might still be using it.

39:52.458 --> 39:55.000
And one of those canisters

39:52.458 --> 39:55.000
was broken.

39:55.041 --> 39:56.125
La Forge to bridge.

39:56.166 --> 39:58.000
We have a working theory,

39:56.166 --> 39:58.000
Captain.

39:58.041 --> 40:00.166
There's a good possibility

39:58.041 --> 40:00.166
we picked up some invidium

40:00.208 --> 40:01.709
from a broken canister

40:00.208 --> 40:01.709
in the cargo bay

40:01.750 --> 40:03.333
and have been spreading it

40:01.750 --> 40:03.333
around the ship.

40:03.375 --> 40:05.166
Working theories

40:03.375 --> 40:05.166
are fine, Geordi

40:05.208 --> 40:07.333
but we need a working solution

40:05.208 --> 40:07.333
in about five minutes.

40:07.375 --> 40:08.792
Understood, Commander.

40:08.834 --> 40:11.375
We're on our way to cargo bay

40:08.834 --> 40:11.375
five for confirmation.

40:27.750 --> 40:29.417
Nothing on the tricorder.

40:35.750 --> 40:37.792
At current acceleration

40:37.834 --> 40:41.500
structural failure will occur

40:37.834 --> 40:41.500
in three minutes, 30 seconds.

40:45.041 --> 40:46.625
If it's in there,

40:45.041 --> 40:46.625
it should show up

40:46.667 --> 40:48.417
on one of the

40:46.667 --> 40:48.417
polarity channels.

40:51.792 --> 40:55.417
There it is.

40:55.458 --> 40:57.583
Duffy and O'Brien picked up

40:55.458 --> 40:57.583
the broken canister

40:57.625 --> 40:58.834
and became contaminated.

40:58.875 --> 41:00.917
If we can get it--

40:58.875 --> 41:00.917
the invidium--

41:00.959 --> 41:03.333
down to minus 200 degrees

41:00.959 --> 41:03.333
celsius, it'll become inert.

41:03.375 --> 41:05.125
La Forge to bridge.

41:05.166 --> 41:07.542
Invidium has been confirmed.

41:07.583 --> 41:10.083
Recommend we flood

41:07.583 --> 41:10.083
the injector pathway conduit

41:10.125 --> 41:11.291
with gaseous cryonetrium.

41:11.333 --> 41:13.125
That ought to neutralize it.

41:13.166 --> 41:15.875
The question is, will the

41:13.166 --> 41:15.875
injectors come back on-line?

41:15.917 --> 41:18.500
They sustained

41:15.917 --> 41:18.500
considerable damage, Captain.

41:18.542 --> 41:21.542
I can't guarantee that we'll

41:18.542 --> 41:21.542
be able to regain control.

41:21.583 --> 41:22.917
We don't have

41:21.583 --> 41:22.917
much choice, do we?

41:22.959 --> 41:24.375
No, sir.

41:24.417 --> 41:25.834
Make it so.

Nice work, Geordi.

Mr. Barclay and I

RIKER:

42:34.625 --> 42:35.917
Acknowledged.

The ship has been

seriously contaminated

42:37.291 --> 42:38.500
with invidium, sir.

42:38.542 --> 42:40.875
Recommend we set a course

42:40.917 --> 42:44.208
for a complete systems-

42:40.917 --> 42:44.208
and bio-decontamination.

42:44.250 --> 42:45.792
Understood.

42:44.250 --> 42:45.792
Picard out.

42:48.583 --> 42:49.875
Glad you were with us

42:49.917 --> 42:52.333
out here in the real

world today, Mr. Barclay.

43:19.792 --> 43:20.959
It has been most difficult

43:21.000 --> 43:23.875
to reach this decision

43:26.083 --> 43:28.792
and discussing it

43:26.083 --> 43:28.792
at length with...

43:28.834 --> 43:30.667
Counselor Troi

43:30.709 --> 43:32.583
I think it's

43:30.709 --> 43:32.583
for the best.

43:34.542 --> 43:37.709
I just wanted to thank you all

43:34.542 --> 43:37.709
for your support.

43:37.750 --> 43:39.917
You'll always be

43:37.750 --> 43:39.917
welcome here, Reg.

43:41.625 --> 43:43.375
I know.

43:43.417 --> 43:46.166
That's why

43:43.417 --> 43:46.166
it's so difficult to leave.

43:49.417 --> 43:52.000
It was a pleasure to serve

43:49.417 --> 43:52.000
with you, Mr. Barclay.

43:52.041 --> 43:54.250
Good luck, Reg.

43:55.750 --> 43:57.750
It's been fun.

44:03.166 --> 44:05.291
Computer.

44:07.208 --> 44:08.083
