00:02.240 --> 00:03.992
I was thinking about the wig
historically.

00:05.520 --> 00:07.875
The Revolutionary War
was the last war fought in wigs...

00:08.039 --> 00:11.237
...and it seems like that must have
been hard. They're going into battle;

00:11.400 --> 00:13.994
"Well, do I have my bullets?
Do I have my bobby pins?"

00:14.160 --> 00:16.958
You gotta make sure you have
everything. Lot more to worry about.

00:17.120 --> 00:20.078
"What if I get killed?
Is my wig on straight?"

00:20.960 --> 00:24.077
I don't know when the whole wig thing
came into style for a man...

00:24.240 --> 00:25.673
...but I know when it went out;

00:25.840 --> 00:28.434
When the mirror was invented.

00:28.600 --> 00:30.158
No guy is looking in a mirror...

00:30.320 --> 00:33.278
...powdering a thatch of horsehair
on his head, going;

00:33.440 --> 00:37.274
"All right, let's go
rap to the ladies."

00:40.000 --> 00:42.958
-I'm looking for a crested blazer.
-A crested blazer.

00:43.120 --> 00:46.476
I wore one once, and I really think
it did something for me.

00:46.640 --> 00:48.392
Yes, I think we might
have something.

00:50.040 --> 00:52.873
The Joseph Abboud crested blazer
is the finest.

00:53.040 --> 00:55.474
That's hand ticking
around the crest...

00:55.640 --> 00:59.110
...and these are the world-famous
corisso buttons...

00:59.280 --> 01:01.032
...made from
the finest antelope horn.

01:02.160 --> 01:04.310
Then they'll match my sneakers.

01:06.400 --> 01:09.278
It looks fabulous on you.
Shall I wrap it up?

01:09.440 --> 01:12.113
You know, I'm not sure.

01:12.280 --> 01:13.759
I'll tell you what.

01:13.920 --> 01:16.798
I'll come back later with someone,
see what they think.

01:20.800 --> 01:23.997
-Really, I'll be back.
-Yeah.

01:24.760 --> 01:28.230
So I didn't like the crest all that much,
but the guy spent 15 minutes with me.

01:28.400 --> 01:31.756
To get out of the store, I said I wanted
to see what someone else thought.

01:31.920 --> 01:34.195
Then he makes a face
like he doesn't believe me.

01:34.360 --> 01:35.952
So he knew
you were making it up?

01:36.120 --> 01:37.155
Yeah, he caught me.

01:37.800 --> 01:39.199
So here's what I want you to do.

01:39.360 --> 01:42.193
Come with me to the store,
and we'll pretend to look at the coat.

01:42.600 --> 01:43.828
That's ridiculous.

01:44.000 --> 01:45.911
Why go back there
if you don't want the coat?

01:46.240 --> 01:49.676
Because he thinks I was lying.
I wanna show him I wasn't.

01:50.000 --> 01:51.194
But you were.

01:51.360 --> 01:54.318
But if you go back with me,
then I'm not.

01:54.840 --> 01:56.717
All right, fine. Whatever.

01:57.560 --> 01:59.198
Problems with the houseguest?

01:59.360 --> 02:00.554
What houseguest?

02:00.720 --> 02:03.473
This friend of Susan's
is staying with us for two weeks.

02:03.640 --> 02:05.551
Now, am I wrong,
or is that excessive?

02:06.440 --> 02:10.193
Well, Bob Sacamano, he stayed
with me once for a year and a half.

02:10.800 --> 02:13.075
-Who is he?
-He's a wig master.

02:14.080 --> 02:16.719
-What is a wig master?
-He's with the touring company...

02:16.880 --> 02:19.474
...of Joseph and the Amazing
Technicolor Dreamcoat.

02:19.640 --> 02:21.278
He's the guy in charge of the wigs.

02:21.960 --> 02:26.397
Boy, imagine liking wigs to the point
it becomes a career choice.

02:26.560 --> 02:29.313
So how about some tickets, George?
You know, I'd kill for a peek.

02:29.480 --> 02:32.438
Yeah, yeah. Sure, sure, sure.
I gotta drop my car off at the new lot.

02:32.600 --> 02:34.955
-What lot's that?
-Jiffy Park. It's incredible.

02:35.120 --> 02:36.439
Seventy-five dollars a month.

02:36.600 --> 02:38.158
Seventy-five bucks a month?

02:38.320 --> 02:40.117
You get this cool T-shirt
when you sign up.

02:40.280 --> 02:41.349
Oh, I'm down.

02:42.680 --> 02:45.752
Remember me? I said I'd come back
with someone, and I did.

02:46.520 --> 02:48.750
-Surprised?
-No, I believed you.

02:48.960 --> 02:50.552
This is Elaine.

02:50.720 --> 02:53.188
Oh, hello. I'm Craig.

02:53.360 --> 02:54.793
Oh, hi.

02:55.240 --> 02:58.676
Well, here it is.

03:00.560 --> 03:02.676
Joseph Abboud.

03:02.840 --> 03:05.593
And look at this hand ticking
around the crest.

03:05.760 --> 03:07.193
You know your clothes.

03:07.360 --> 03:10.636
Well, I'm in the biz.
I work for J. Peterman.

03:10.800 --> 03:14.156
I love J. Peterman.
I especially enjoy the catalog.

03:14.320 --> 03:16.436
Those fanciful narratives
really take me away.

03:16.600 --> 03:17.749
-Oh, really?
-Yeah.

03:17.920 --> 03:19.399
-You know what? I write those.
-No.

03:19.560 --> 03:22.632
Elaine, what about the crest?
What do you think of the crest here?

03:22.800 --> 03:24.392
Well, I love it.

03:24.560 --> 03:26.073
-You what?
-I think it's great.

03:26.240 --> 03:28.993
-I think you should get it.
-Well....

03:31.200 --> 03:34.317
-Will it be check or credit card?
-Check.

03:35.040 --> 03:37.952
I'll need you to write down your
phone number on the check for me.

03:38.120 --> 03:39.758
Perhaps you could do the same.

03:45.880 --> 03:47.279
You weren't supposed to say that.

03:47.440 --> 03:49.635
-But I really did like it.
-That's not the point.

03:49.800 --> 03:52.360
You put me in a position
where I had no choice.

03:52.520 --> 03:53.555
Sorry.

03:53.840 --> 03:56.354
What about that guy
asking you out right in front of me?

03:56.520 --> 03:58.431
What is the big deal?

03:58.600 --> 04:01.717
It was very emasculating. He doesn't
know the nature of our relationship.

04:01.880 --> 04:05.111
You're there approving new clothes.
That's a girlfriend job.

04:05.280 --> 04:06.474
How dare he?

04:06.640 --> 04:08.551
He dared.

04:13.760 --> 04:16.399
Hi, George. How was your day?

04:17.079 --> 04:19.116
Good. Good day.

04:19.920 --> 04:23.196
-You?
-I am getting so much work done.

04:23.360 --> 04:26.397
-See?
-Very nice.

04:26.560 --> 04:28.471
Hey, sweetie, how was your day?

04:28.640 --> 04:30.870
I already asked him that.
He said, "Good. Good day."

04:32.000 --> 04:38.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:39.320 --> 04:40.958
Thank God you're home.
I'm locked out.

04:41.120 --> 04:42.712
I dropped my car at Jiffy Park...

04:42.880 --> 04:45.189
...and I forgot to take
my apartment key off the ring.

04:45.360 --> 04:48.796
-So you got my spare?
-No, I gave it back to you.

04:48.960 --> 04:50.109
You did?

04:50.280 --> 04:52.589
Well, look,
can you take me over there?

04:52.760 --> 04:54.159
-Oh, come on.
-Oh, come on, Jerry.

04:54.320 --> 04:57.392
-It's all the way over to 12th Avenue.
-I didn't tell you to park there.

04:57.560 --> 05:00.120
Now someone's gotta drive you
every time you need your car?

05:00.280 --> 05:02.635
-Take the bus.
-I'm not gonna take the bus.

05:02.800 --> 05:04.756
That's why I got a car.

05:05.360 --> 05:07.749
-Forget it.
-I'm gonna get George to pick me up.

05:07.920 --> 05:09.672
He won't take you.

05:11.920 --> 05:14.480
Got it, got it. Hello?

05:14.640 --> 05:16.153
Can you take me over to Jiffy Park?

05:16.320 --> 05:19.915
Yeah, I'll pick you up right now.
All right. Okay. Gotta go.

05:24.160 --> 05:25.718
So the wig mas--

05:25.880 --> 05:28.474
The wig master said
you could stop by the theater tonight...

05:28.640 --> 05:30.517
...and he'll show you around.

05:31.160 --> 05:32.639
Would you pick a station!

05:32.800 --> 05:35.189
I like them all.

05:38.040 --> 05:39.189
Oh, great.

05:39.360 --> 05:41.749
Now the volume knob fell off.

05:44.760 --> 05:45.909
What's this?

05:46.080 --> 05:48.389
-Oh, God.
-What?

05:48.560 --> 05:50.039
It's a c--

05:50.200 --> 05:52.475
It's a condom!

05:55.680 --> 05:58.399
How do you like working there
at The Andover Shop?

05:58.560 --> 06:01.791
I mean, it's pretty swanky.
Upscale clientele.

06:01.960 --> 06:03.837
Except for Jerry.

06:06.000 --> 06:07.831
So did you see anything you liked?

06:09.200 --> 06:11.111
Because I can get you
a considerable discount.

06:11.560 --> 06:13.516
Really? Well, actually,
yeah, I did see...

06:13.680 --> 06:17.389
...this amazing little black dress.
It was sleeveless.

06:17.560 --> 06:19.357
-The Nicole Miller.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

06:19.520 --> 06:21.351
-I'll take care of it.
-Really?

06:21.520 --> 06:22.714
But I barely know you.

06:22.880 --> 06:27.032
Well, we'll just have to
do something about that, won't we?

06:37.080 --> 06:39.071
-Hey, Greg.
-It's Craig.

06:39.240 --> 06:41.037
Oh, right. Nice lunch with Elaine?

06:42.080 --> 06:43.274
Yes, lovely.

06:43.440 --> 06:46.398
You know, I'm just curious, how did
you know she wasn't my girlfriend?

06:46.560 --> 06:48.949
Well, I could just sense it.

06:49.120 --> 06:50.553
You know, we used to go out.

06:50.720 --> 06:54.759
-Oh, you did?
-Oh, yeah, we went way out and wild.

06:55.640 --> 06:58.029
-Hey, Jer.
-Hi, Elaine.

06:58.200 --> 07:01.351
Would you like to buy a rose
for your wife?

07:02.880 --> 07:05.269
How do you know
she's not my wife?

07:07.200 --> 07:09.156
I wanna know,
how did that get into my car?

07:09.320 --> 07:12.915
Hey, look, you walk in this city,
things are gonna stick to your foot.

07:13.080 --> 07:15.594
You open your car and...condom.

07:16.800 --> 07:19.030
That doesn't explain
the lipstick on the dashboard.

07:19.200 --> 07:22.317
Here, take a few shirts.

07:25.680 --> 07:27.511
-What?
-I'm terribly sorry, Mr. Kramer...

07:27.680 --> 07:30.717
...but we can't get your car now.
The keys have been misplaced.

07:30.880 --> 07:33.440
I need those keys. I won't be able
to get into my apartment.

07:33.600 --> 07:36.956
Mr. Kramer, you like Cadillacs?

07:38.080 --> 07:40.548
Yeah, I like Cadillacs.
Why, what do you got on your mind?

07:41.400 --> 07:44.073
Take that pink Cadillac Eldorado
over there.

07:44.240 --> 07:45.673
It's a Mary Kay car.

07:45.840 --> 07:48.274
-Mary Kay?
-Mary Kay car.

07:48.440 --> 07:50.317
I'll see you later.
Thanks for driving me.

07:50.480 --> 07:52.789
Hey, what's happening?

07:52.960 --> 07:54.996
I'm gonna hang around here
a little while.

07:55.160 --> 07:56.912
Something funny going on here.

07:58.400 --> 08:01.198
You were wrong about Craig.
He's a very sweet guy.

08:01.360 --> 08:02.713
Well, what about the ponytail?

08:02.880 --> 08:04.313
-What about it?
-Come on.

08:04.480 --> 08:06.755
Ponytail? Get real.

08:07.360 --> 08:10.397
All I know is he promised me
a discount on that dress.

08:10.560 --> 08:12.278
Of course he did.
The guy's working you.

08:12.440 --> 08:15.432
Oh, Jerry, I've been around enough
to know when I'm being worked.

08:15.600 --> 08:19.275
-Have you slept with him yet?
-I just met him this morning.

08:20.160 --> 08:21.354
It's been known to happen.

08:22.480 --> 08:24.152
I'm telling you right now, Elaine...

08:24.320 --> 08:26.675
...this guy's gonna dangle that dress
in front of you...

08:26.840 --> 08:29.718
...Iike a dirt farmer
dangles a carrot in front of a mule.

08:30.480 --> 08:32.072
Well, this is all very flattering--

08:32.240 --> 08:35.357
-Like a shark fisherman with chum.
-Okay.

08:35.520 --> 08:38.318
-Like a shrimp farmer--
-Okay.

08:39.799 --> 08:41.711
Well, that's the grand tour...

08:41.880 --> 08:44.188
-...but I saved the best for last.
-Oh, yeah.

08:45.080 --> 08:47.196
Behold, the Technicolor Dreamcoat.

08:49.200 --> 08:50.838
Spectacular.

08:52.400 --> 08:55.039
Excuse me. Would you mind
if I ask you a few questions?

08:56.120 --> 08:57.348
Are you a cop?

08:57.520 --> 09:00.717
Oh, no, no. No, I'm not a cop.
I work for the Yankees.

09:01.480 --> 09:02.674
They stink.

09:04.000 --> 09:09.438
Nevertheless, I was wondering
if you and your friends...

09:09.600 --> 09:12.398
...are doing business
here at the Jiffy Park?

09:12.560 --> 09:15.677
You know,
what do you people call it?

09:15.840 --> 09:17.717
Turning tricks?

09:19.480 --> 09:22.153
Anyway, see, the thing is,
I found a condom in my car.

09:22.320 --> 09:23.833
Now, I'm not saying it's yours...

09:24.000 --> 09:26.309
...I just wanna know
if I should change parking lots.

09:26.920 --> 09:29.354
Get lost, mister.
I'm trying to make a living here.

09:29.520 --> 09:32.159
I'll pay for your time.
I just need some information.

09:32.320 --> 09:34.390
How much do you want?
Ten? Fifteen?

09:34.560 --> 09:36.278
-You have change for 20?
-Fifteen?

09:36.440 --> 09:37.759
-Well....
-George?

09:37.920 --> 09:39.399
Hi, honey.

09:49.400 --> 09:52.631
-I hope that you're telling me the truth.
-Of course I'm telling the truth.

09:52.800 --> 09:54.756
Because I have to be able
to trust you.

09:54.920 --> 09:57.832
If I can't trust you,
there's no way that this can work.

10:01.760 --> 10:03.318
Really?

10:03.480 --> 10:04.913
Yeah.

10:05.520 --> 10:07.829
Well, then you really have
something to think about...

10:08.000 --> 10:10.639
...because, you know,
if there's any doubt in your mind--

10:10.800 --> 10:13.030
And it doesn't even have
to be a big doubt, you know.

10:13.200 --> 10:14.838
Even a tiny doubt,
a dot of a doubt--

10:15.000 --> 10:15.989
There's no doubt.

10:16.160 --> 10:19.277
Because if there's any doubt at all,
I feel that we should cultivate it.

10:19.680 --> 10:20.874
Cultivate it?

10:21.440 --> 10:24.318
Yes, you know, deal with it.
We have to deal with the doubt, Susan.

10:24.480 --> 10:26.550
The doubt must be dealt with.

10:26.720 --> 10:29.359
I have no doubt, George. Do you?

10:31.400 --> 10:33.391
No.

10:35.000 --> 10:36.956
You know, I can't wait
to get that dress.

10:37.360 --> 10:39.157
Yeah, it should arrive imminently.

10:39.320 --> 10:40.548
Arrive?

10:40.720 --> 10:43.393
-Yes, from Milan.
-But you said it was in the store.

10:43.560 --> 10:46.074
No, no, no. We sold out.
We've had to order some more.

10:46.240 --> 10:49.232
-But I thought Nicole Miller was ma--
-Well--

10:49.400 --> 10:51.595
-lan.
-Hey, Craig.

10:51.760 --> 10:53.079
Elaine, this is lan.

10:53.240 --> 10:55.196
-Oh, hi, lan.
-lan.

10:55.360 --> 10:57.191
-lan.
-lan.

10:57.360 --> 10:59.590
He's a friend of mine from England.

10:59.760 --> 11:01.113
So tell me, how are you doing?

11:01.280 --> 11:03.510
Well, I'm working over
at The Andover Shop, actually.

11:03.680 --> 11:04.999
You should come by.

11:05.160 --> 11:06.798
I'll get you a great discount.

11:06.960 --> 11:08.393
Maybe I will.

11:08.960 --> 11:11.315
-Nice meeting you.
-Oh, nice to meet you.

11:11.480 --> 11:13.914
-Cheerio.
-Bye, lan.

11:14.600 --> 11:16.511
So you getting him a discount too?

11:16.680 --> 11:18.591
Well, why so surprised?

11:18.760 --> 11:20.318
No reason.

11:24.600 --> 11:27.797
That clothing salesman had a lot of
nerve hitting on Elaine in front of me.

11:28.360 --> 11:31.511
He stands to make a big commission
too, on that jacket with the crest...

11:31.680 --> 11:33.432
...that nobody seems to like.

11:34.080 --> 11:37.231
You know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna take that jacket back.

11:37.480 --> 11:40.233
I'm putting this guy
right out of commission.

11:41.280 --> 11:44.238
All right. I'm gonna turn in.

11:44.400 --> 11:47.039
-Turn in?
-Yeah, I had a tough day.

11:48.040 --> 11:49.268
It's only 9:00.

11:49.800 --> 11:53.076
Yeah, well, you know,
I don't argue with the body, Jerry.

11:53.240 --> 11:55.674
That's an argument you can't win.

11:55.840 --> 11:57.273
I can't go to sleep at 9:00.

11:57.960 --> 12:01.111
Well, you can
go to your room and read.

12:02.920 --> 12:05.434
Hey, look, you know,
you're the one who's locked out.

12:05.600 --> 12:07.909
I'm letting you stay here.
You're wearing my bathrobe.

12:08.080 --> 12:09.274
You should adapt to me.

12:09.440 --> 12:11.112
But I'm tired.

12:11.280 --> 12:13.032
Why don't you go sleep
at Newman's?

12:13.200 --> 12:14.872
Oh, he's got a girl up there.

12:15.040 --> 12:18.510
This quilt is too thin.
I know I'm gonna get cold.

12:18.680 --> 12:21.433
I don't even fit on this couch.

12:22.280 --> 12:23.872
I don't even know if I'm gonna sleep.

12:24.040 --> 12:25.234
Well, that's all I've got.

12:27.440 --> 12:29.476
Well, can I sleep with you?

12:33.440 --> 12:35.476
Well, you've got that big,
comfortable bed...

12:35.640 --> 12:37.596
...and that nice, warm quilt.

12:37.760 --> 12:40.877
Kramer, there's no way
you're sleeping with me.

12:41.120 --> 12:42.439
-Why?
-Why?

12:42.600 --> 12:45.751
-Yeah.
-Do I really have to explain why?

12:45.920 --> 12:47.353
-Well, l--
-Hey.

12:47.520 --> 12:49.909
-Hey.
-What's that?

12:50.360 --> 12:54.148
Squire's walking stick.
I had to write about it for the catalog.

12:55.800 --> 12:57.518
-You want it?
-Yeah.

12:57.680 --> 12:59.477
You can have it.
I don't need it anymore.

12:59.640 --> 13:02.200
Oh, mama.

13:06.040 --> 13:10.352
Okay, so I am positive
you are wrong about Craig.

13:10.680 --> 13:11.669
Yeah, why?

13:11.840 --> 13:15.833
Because he told a man he'd give him
a discount too. A man, Jerry.

13:16.000 --> 13:18.230
-So? Who is he?
-Some friend of his from England.

13:18.400 --> 13:20.311
Don't you see?

13:20.480 --> 13:23.517
-It's all a big scam.
-You're nuts.

13:23.680 --> 13:26.558
Well, how do you know he's not
wondering the same thing about you?

13:27.280 --> 13:29.396
-What do you mean?
-What do I mean?

13:29.560 --> 13:33.109
Well, perhaps he thinks that
you're working him for the discount.

13:33.280 --> 13:37.637
Shaking that little butt of yours
into big, big savings.

13:37.800 --> 13:40.633
Then when you get it, you know,
you drop him like a hot potato.

13:40.800 --> 13:41.915
Oh, please.

13:42.080 --> 13:44.594
No, see, the two of you
need to work on trust.

13:44.760 --> 13:46.113
And then, and only then...

13:46.280 --> 13:49.511
...will there be a free exchange
of sex and discounts.

13:51.040 --> 13:53.918
The cornerstones
of a healthy relationship.

13:54.080 --> 13:58.039
And now, if you would excuse us...

13:58.640 --> 14:00.756
...we need to get to bed.

14:21.600 --> 14:23.352
Yeah.

14:24.440 --> 14:27.193
This patio furniture's on sale.

14:30.200 --> 14:32.998
Excuse me.
I think I made a big mistake.

14:33.160 --> 14:36.152
-I'd like my deposit back, please.
-What's the problem?

14:36.320 --> 14:39.153
You got hookers turning tricks
in my car. How's that for starters?

14:39.320 --> 14:40.639
That is all hearsay.

14:41.480 --> 14:43.948
All right, very good.
I'd like my car and deposit back.

14:44.560 --> 14:46.869
-Can't do it.
-What do you mean?

14:47.040 --> 14:49.679
If you read the agreement,
the deposit is nonrefundable.

14:50.240 --> 14:51.832
Does it say anything
in the contract...

14:52.000 --> 14:53.797
...about my car
being used as a whorehouse?

14:53.960 --> 14:55.837
I don't remember reading
that clause either.

14:56.720 --> 14:59.359
What can I tell you, buddy?
Take it up with Consumer Affairs.

15:01.440 --> 15:04.273
All right, just give me my car
and let me get the hell out of here.

15:04.440 --> 15:06.510
That's going to be a problem.

15:08.320 --> 15:10.072
-Why?
-It's all the way in the back.

15:10.240 --> 15:11.992
We can't get it out
for a couple of days.

15:12.680 --> 15:15.592
What are you talking about?
I want my car.

15:15.760 --> 15:17.910
We ask that you
please bear with us.

15:18.320 --> 15:19.958
Bear with you?

15:20.120 --> 15:21.473
This is a parking lot.

15:21.640 --> 15:23.790
People are supposed
to be able to get their cars.

15:24.280 --> 15:26.032
Ideally.

15:28.160 --> 15:29.912
Excuse me,
I'd like to return this jacket.

15:30.080 --> 15:31.672
Certainly. May I ask why?

15:32.440 --> 15:34.112
For spite.

15:35.840 --> 15:37.478
Spite?

15:37.640 --> 15:40.757
That's right. I don't care for
the salesman that sold it to me.

15:40.920 --> 15:43.753
I don't think you can
return an item for spite.

15:44.280 --> 15:46.840
-What do you mean?
-lf there was some problem with it...

15:47.000 --> 15:49.958
...if it were unsatisfactory in some way,
then we could do it for you.

15:50.120 --> 15:53.749
But I'm afraid spite doesn't fit
any of our conditions for a refund.

15:53.920 --> 15:56.480
I wanna return it. What's the difference
what the reason is?

15:56.880 --> 15:59.348
Let me speak with the manager.
Excuse me.

15:59.520 --> 16:00.919
Bob?

16:01.080 --> 16:04.356
This gentleman....
Spite.

16:07.680 --> 16:10.240
-What seems to be the problem?
-I wanna return this jacket.

16:10.400 --> 16:13.437
She asked me why, I said, "For spite,"
and now she won't take it back.

16:14.320 --> 16:19.110
That's true. We can't return an item
based purely on spite.

16:19.640 --> 16:22.677
Well, so fine, then. Then I don't
want it. That's why I'm returning it.

16:22.840 --> 16:25.877
Well, you already said spite, so....

16:26.560 --> 16:29.757
-But I changed my mind.
-No, you said spite.

16:29.920 --> 16:31.638
Too late.

16:31.800 --> 16:35.998
-Nice hat.
-Get a calendar, honey. It's the '90s.

16:36.560 --> 16:37.788
-Elaine.
-Oh, hey.

16:37.960 --> 16:39.678
These are my friends,
Jerry and Elaine.

16:39.840 --> 16:41.114
-Hi.
-Hi, how are you doing?

16:41.280 --> 16:42.872
-I'm Charmaine.
-I'm Ethan.

16:43.040 --> 16:46.077
Yeah, she's the costume designer,
and he's the wig master for the show.

16:46.240 --> 16:48.515
-Oh, you're staying with George.
-Right, George.

16:48.680 --> 16:50.477
I get the feeling
he doesn't want me there.

16:50.640 --> 16:52.631
He doesn't even want himself there.

16:53.640 --> 16:55.676
-Why don't you sit down and join us?
-All right.

16:55.840 --> 16:57.592
I can't. I've gotta go meet a friend.

16:57.760 --> 17:00.149
Well, what are we, dog meat?

17:00.320 --> 17:02.390
Another champagne coolie, please.

17:02.560 --> 17:05.676
-You have really beautiful hair.
-Oh, thanks. Thanks very much.

17:05.839 --> 17:08.308
Ever thought of selling it?
It would make a brilliant wig.

17:08.480 --> 17:11.358
-They make wigs out of human hair?
-And pay plenty for them.

17:11.520 --> 17:13.431
Okay, well, you guys
are gonna have fun here.

17:13.599 --> 17:15.511
-All right.
-See you later.

17:15.680 --> 17:18.558
I just remembered, I gotta get
the Dreamcoat from the dry cleaner.

17:18.720 --> 17:21.678
-You'll let me wear the other one?
-Yeah, but you have to be careful.

17:21.839 --> 17:24.434
-It's my only backup.
-Who do you think you're talking to?

17:24.599 --> 17:25.749
-Okay, bye-bye.
-Bye.

17:25.920 --> 17:27.319
Bye.

17:28.840 --> 17:30.910
There's your champagne coolie.

17:31.720 --> 17:34.029
Well, looks like
it's just you and me, cowboy.

17:34.200 --> 17:35.633
Yeah, I guess so.

17:36.400 --> 17:37.594
Well, here we are.

17:37.760 --> 17:40.274
I am beat.

17:41.280 --> 17:43.032
That's nice.

17:44.480 --> 17:45.993
So....

17:46.160 --> 17:50.073
So do you have any idea when
the Nicole Millers are coming in?

17:50.840 --> 17:52.796
Oh, yeah, the Nicole Millers.

17:52.960 --> 17:54.473
Well, the funniest thing.

17:54.640 --> 17:56.949
I've learned that the new shipment's
coming by boat...

17:57.120 --> 18:00.396
...which does tend to take a bit longer,
what with the waves and all.

18:01.400 --> 18:05.518
So you'll just have to be
a little bit patient.

18:05.680 --> 18:08.478
So you have no idea
when they'll arrive?

18:08.640 --> 18:10.790
No, I'm really not sure.

18:13.440 --> 18:15.829
How can you love a guy like that?
He's a mess.

18:16.000 --> 18:17.433
I don't see them together at all.

18:18.240 --> 18:20.071
-Ethan?
-Yes?

18:20.240 --> 18:22.390
Hi, it's me, Jesse.

18:22.560 --> 18:24.118
George Hamilton's
personal assistant.

18:24.280 --> 18:27.636
-Right, right. How are you?
-Good. Good to see you.

18:27.800 --> 18:29.199
-This is Jerry.
-Hello.

18:29.360 --> 18:30.793
Yeah.

18:30.960 --> 18:32.313
Ethan, what brings you to town?

18:32.480 --> 18:34.710
Joseph and the Amazing
Technicolor Dreamcoat.

18:34.880 --> 18:38.953
You're kidding. Listen, maybe
you and I should get together.

18:39.120 --> 18:41.873
Have you been on the slide
at Club USA? It's intense.

18:42.040 --> 18:44.952
Excuse me. Excuse me.
Are you asking him out?

18:45.440 --> 18:46.873
Yeah, I guess you could say that.

18:47.040 --> 18:48.632
Right in front of me?

18:48.800 --> 18:50.392
How do you know
we're not together?

18:50.560 --> 18:53.438
Two guys sitting, laughing,
drinking champagne coolies.

18:54.080 --> 18:55.991
I don't know.
I just didn't think you were.

18:56.160 --> 18:58.116
Well, we're sitting here together.

18:58.280 --> 18:59.474
Why wouldn't you think that?

19:00.400 --> 19:01.879
I don't know. I just didn't.

19:02.040 --> 19:04.110
Well, it's very emasculating.

19:10.240 --> 19:12.834
-Hello?
-This is Bob from The Andover Shop.

19:13.000 --> 19:15.673
I'm trying to reach Craig Stewart.
He left this number.

19:17.040 --> 19:19.110
Oh, is it important?

19:19.280 --> 19:21.874
-Well....
-Hey, let me ask you something.

19:22.040 --> 19:24.918
Do you know when the Nicole Millers
are coming in from Milan?

19:25.080 --> 19:26.069
Nicole Millers?

19:26.240 --> 19:30.392
We aren't expecting any Nicole Millers.
In fact, we have too many as it is.

19:32.040 --> 19:35.191
Well, do you have any
in a size four?

19:35.680 --> 19:37.079
Yes, several.

19:37.240 --> 19:40.073
Just tell him he doesn't have
to be in tomorrow until 11.

19:40.240 --> 19:43.357
Oh, yeah, I'll make sure
he gets the message.

19:47.920 --> 19:49.638
They make wigs out of human hair?

19:49.800 --> 19:51.916
And pay plenty for them.

20:40.480 --> 20:41.993
Oh, sweet Maria.

20:43.920 --> 20:46.388
Hey, let's go.

20:49.920 --> 20:51.433
What are you doing in my car?

20:51.600 --> 20:53.318
Hey, hey, where are you going?

20:53.480 --> 20:55.835
-Hey, you just cost me some money.
-Hey, cool it, lady.

20:58.560 --> 21:01.074
Cool it. Cool it, lady. Cool it.

21:01.240 --> 21:03.879
Police officers, freeze right there.

21:12.400 --> 21:15.153
Okay, big daddy, take the hat off.

21:15.960 --> 21:18.076
All right, turn to your right.

21:18.240 --> 21:20.629
I said turn, pimp!

21:21.640 --> 21:23.676
I'm not a pimp.
