01:21.700 --> 01:27.000
I should've known that you would
be here, Professor McGonagall.

01:37.900 --> 01:41.400
Good evening, Professor Dumbledore.

01:43.600 --> 01:46.899
Are the rumors true, Albus?

01:46.900 --> 01:52.299
I'm afraid so, professor.
The good and the bad.

01:52.300 --> 01:55.799
- And the boy?
- Hagrid is bringing him.

01:55.800 --> 02:00.199
Do you think it wise to trust Hagrid
with something as important as this?

02:00.200 --> 02:05.400
Ah, Professor, I would trust Hagrid
with my life.

02:24.000 --> 02:28.299
Professor Dumbledore, sir.
Professor McGonagall.

02:28.300 --> 02:32.399
- No problems, I trust, Hagrid?
- No, sir.

02:32.400 --> 02:37.200
Little tyke fell asleep just
as we were flying over Bristol.

02:37.700 --> 02:40.400
Try not to wake him.

02:40.900 --> 02:43.300
There you go.

02:48.500 --> 02:53.199
Albus, do you really think it's safe,
leaving him with these people?

02:53.200 --> 02:58.699
I've watched them all day.
They're the worst sort of Muggles, imaginable.

02:58.700 --> 03:02.899
- They really are...
- The only family he has.

03:02.900 --> 03:08.499
This boy will be famous. There won't be a child
in our world who doesn't know his name.

03:08.500 --> 03:09.999
Exactly.

03:10.000 --> 03:14.600
He's far better off growing up
away from all of that.

03:16.800 --> 03:19.800
Until he's ready.

03:31.500 --> 03:37.300
There, there, Hagrid.
It's not really goodbye, after all.

03:48.800 --> 03:50.700
Good luck...

03:51.100 --> 03:53.800
...Harry Potter.

04:11.100 --> 04:14.400
Up. Get up!

04:16.700 --> 04:18.600
Now!

04:31.900 --> 04:35.600
Wake up, cousin!
We're going to the zoo!

04:46.500 --> 04:52.100
- Here he comes, the birthday boy.
- Happy birthday, son.

04:53.600 --> 04:56.999
Why don't you just cook the breakfast,
and try not to burn anything.

04:57.000 --> 05:02.199
- Yes, Aunt Petunia.
- I want everything to be perfect...

05:02.200 --> 05:05.299
...for my Dudley's special day!

05:05.300 --> 05:10.600
- Hurry up! Bring my coffee, boy.
- Yes, Uncle Vernon.

05:11.500 --> 05:14.900
Aren't they wonderful, darling?

05:16.800 --> 05:20.499
- How many are there?
- 36. Counted them myself.

05:20.500 --> 05:23.899
36?! But last year... last year I had 37!

05:23.900 --> 05:26.481
But some of them are quite a
bit bigger than last year's.

05:26.482 --> 05:27.999
I don't care how big they are!

05:28.000 --> 05:30.699
Oh, now, now, now. This is
what we're going to do...

05:30.700 --> 05:35.400
...is that when we go out, we're going to buy
you two new presents. How's that, pumpkin?

05:37.100 --> 05:43.000
It should be a lovely day at the zoo.
I'm really looking forward to it.

05:46.000 --> 05:48.099
I'm warning you now, boy.

05:48.100 --> 05:51.699
Any funny business, any at all...

05:51.700 --> 05:55.100
...and you won't have
any meals for a week.

05:55.500 --> 05:57.600
Get in.

06:04.500 --> 06:07.200
Make it move.

06:09.600 --> 06:11.499
Move!

06:11.500 --> 06:14.199
- Move!
- He's asleep!

06:14.200 --> 06:17.000
He's boring.

06:19.100 --> 06:20.799
Sorry about him.

06:20.800 --> 06:24.800
He doesn't understand
what it's like, lying there day after day...

06:25.100 --> 06:29.200
...watching people press
their ugly faces in on you.

06:31.700 --> 06:34.600
Can you hear me?

06:36.900 --> 06:41.200
It's just, I've never talked
to a snake before.

06:41.300 --> 06:42.999
Do you...?

06:43.000 --> 06:47.400
I mean, do you talk to people often?

06:48.200 --> 06:51.699
You're from Burma, aren't you?
Was it nice there?

06:51.700 --> 06:54.300
Do you miss your family?

06:56.900 --> 07:01.799
I see. That's me as well.
I never knew my parents either.

07:01.800 --> 07:07.100
Mummy, Dad, come here! you won't believe
what this snake is doing!

07:29.900 --> 07:32.099
Thanks.

07:32.100 --> 07:33.900
Anytime.

07:36.900 --> 07:39.100
Snake!

07:54.300 --> 07:57.899
Mum! Mummy! Help me!

07:57.900 --> 08:01.300
My darling boy!
How did you get in there?

08:01.500 --> 08:06.900
Who did this? How did you get
in there? ls there a snake?

08:11.500 --> 08:17.100
It's all right, sweetheart.
We'll get you out of these cold clothes.

08:18.500 --> 08:21.699
- What happened?
- I swear, I don't know!

08:21.700 --> 08:25.800
One minute the glass was there and
then it was gone, it was like magic.

08:29.900 --> 08:33.000
There's no such thing as magic.

08:46.800 --> 08:49.200
And smile!

08:50.400 --> 08:53.499
Vernon, just look at him!
I can't believe it!

08:53.500 --> 08:56.199
In just a week, he'll be off to Smeltings.

08:56.200 --> 09:00.199
Caveat Smeltonia.
Proudest moment of my life.

09:00.200 --> 09:03.600
Will I have to wear that too?

09:04.300 --> 09:06.900
What? You? Go to Smeltings?

09:12.200 --> 09:15.899
Don't be so stupid! You're going to go
to the state school. Where you belong.

09:15.900 --> 09:19.599
This is what you'll going to be wearing,
when I finish dyeing it.

09:19.600 --> 09:24.099
That's Dudley's old uniform.
It'll fit me like bits of old elephant skin.

09:24.100 --> 09:26.699
It'll fit you well enough.

09:26.700 --> 09:30.700
Go get the post. Go!

10:00.300 --> 10:03.199
Marge is ill. Ate a funny whelk.

10:03.200 --> 10:06.599
- Dad, look! Harry's got a letter!
- Hey, give it back! It's mine!

10:06.600 --> 10:09.600
Yours? Who'd be writing to you?

10:40.600 --> 10:45.500
No more mail through this letterbox.

10:57.800 --> 11:00.000
Have a lovely day at the office, dear.

11:03.500 --> 11:05.500
Shoo! Go on.

12:04.100 --> 12:07.200
Fine day, Sunday.

12:07.600 --> 12:12.499
In my opinion, best day of the week.
Why is that, Dudley?

12:12.500 --> 12:17.099
- Because there's no post on Sundays?
- Right you are, Harry!

12:17.100 --> 12:20.200
No post on Sunday.

12:21.300 --> 12:25.500
No blasted letters today! No, sir.

12:25.800 --> 12:31.000
Not one single bloody letter. Not one!

12:39.100 --> 12:43.300
No, sir, not one blasted, miserable...

12:54.500 --> 12:57.000
Make it stop, please!

12:58.500 --> 13:00.800
Stop it!

13:04.600 --> 13:07.800
Mummy, what's happening?

13:11.000 --> 13:15.600
Give me that! Give me that letter!

13:17.900 --> 13:20.000
Get off!

13:23.500 --> 13:27.900
They're my letters! Let go of me!

13:28.500 --> 13:31.800
That's it! We're going away!

13:32.100 --> 13:35.999
Far away, where they can't find us!

13:36.000 --> 13:39.600
Daddy's gone mad, hasn't he?

14:14.200 --> 14:16.800
Make a wish, Harry.

14:32.500 --> 14:34.900
Who's there?

14:46.800 --> 14:49.500
Sorry about that.

14:56.100 --> 15:01.000
I demand that you leave at once, Sir!
You are breaking and entering!

15:03.500 --> 15:06.700
Dry up, Dursley, you great prune.

15:11.600 --> 15:15.299
Mind, I haven't seen you
since you was a baby, Harry.

15:15.300 --> 15:20.099
But you're a bit more along than I would have
expected. Particularly 'round the middle.

15:20.100 --> 15:23.200
I'm not Harry.

15:24.700 --> 15:28.800
- I am.
- Well, of course you are.

15:29.200 --> 15:30.999
Got something for you.

15:31.000 --> 15:36.900
Afraid I might have sat on it at somepoint,
but I imagine it'll taste fine just the same.

15:39.100 --> 15:42.800
Baked it myself, words and all.

15:48.100 --> 15:49.399
Thank you.

15:49.400 --> 15:53.800
It's not every day that your young man
turns 11, now is it?

16:08.700 --> 16:12.999
Excuse me, who are you?

16:13.000 --> 16:18.199
Rubeus Hagrid, Keeper of Keys
and Grounds at Hogwarts.

16:18.200 --> 16:22.200
- Of course, you know all about Hogwarts.
- Sorry, no.

16:22.500 --> 16:27.699
No? Blimey, Harry, didn't you ever wonder where
your mum and dad learned it all?

16:27.700 --> 16:29.299
Learnt what?

16:29.300 --> 16:32.100
You're a wizard, Harry.

16:33.000 --> 16:35.299
- I'm a what?
- A wizard.

16:35.300 --> 16:38.599
And a thumping good one, I'd wager,
once you're trained up little.

16:38.600 --> 16:41.699
No, you've made a mistake.
I mean...

16:41.700 --> 16:45.000
...l can't be a wizard.

16:45.300 --> 16:50.400
I mean, I'm just Harry. Just Harry.

16:51.100 --> 16:55.399
Well, Just Harry, did you ever
make anything happen?

16:55.400 --> 17:00.300
Anything you couldn't explain,
when you were angry or scared?

17:16.400 --> 17:19.799
"Dear Mr. Potter,
We are pleased to inform you...

17:19.800 --> 17:23.199
...that you have been accepted at
Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry."

17:23.200 --> 17:28.398
He will not be going there! We swore when we
took him in we'd put a stop to all this rubbish.

17:28.400 --> 17:32.799
You knew? You knew all along
and you never told me?

17:32.800 --> 17:36.099
Of course we knew.
How could you not be?

17:36.100 --> 17:39.999
My perfect sister being who she was.

17:40.000 --> 17:46.199
My mother and father were so proud
the day she got her letter.

17:46.200 --> 17:50.599
"We have a witch in the family.
Isn't it wonderful?"

17:50.600 --> 17:54.499
I was the only one to see her
for what she was.

17:54.500 --> 17:56.399
A freak!

17:56.400 --> 17:59.599
Then she met that Potter,
and then she had you...

17:59.600 --> 18:05.499
...and I knew you would be the same.
Just as strange, just as abnormal.

18:05.500 --> 18:10.699
And then, if you please, she went and got
herself blown up! And we got landed with you.

18:10.700 --> 18:14.999
Blown up? You told me
my parents died in a car crash.

18:15.000 --> 18:19.499
A car crash? A car crash killed
Lily and James Potter?

18:19.500 --> 18:23.599
- We had to say something.
- It's an outrage! It's a scandal!

18:23.600 --> 18:26.299
He'll not be going.

18:26.300 --> 18:29.799
Oh, and I suppose a great Muggle like yourself's
going to stop him, are you?

18:29.800 --> 18:31.100
Muggle?

18:31.200 --> 18:35.399
Non-magic folk. This boy's had
his name down ever since he were born.

18:35.400 --> 18:39.499
He's going to the finest school
of witchcraft and wizardry in the world and...

18:39.500 --> 18:45.599
...he'll be under the finest headmaster that
Hogwarts has ever seen, Albus Dumbledore.

18:45.600 --> 18:50.599
I will not pay to have some crackpot
old fool teach him magic tricks.

18:50.600 --> 18:55.399
Never insult Albus Dumbledore...

18:55.400 --> 18:57.700
...in front of me.

19:15.300 --> 19:20.799
Oh, um, I'd appreciate it if you didn't tell
anyone at Hogwarts about that.

19:20.800 --> 19:25.200
- Strickly speaking, I'm not allowed to do magic.
- Okay.

19:26.200 --> 19:29.500
Ooh, We're a bit behind schedule.
Best be off.

19:35.400 --> 19:38.900
Unless you'd rather stay, of course.

19:52.700 --> 19:56.800
"First year's students will require
three sets of plain work robes...

19:57.000 --> 19:58.799
...one wand."

19:58.800 --> 20:02.099
Essential bit of equipment, Harry.

20:02.100 --> 20:07.099
"One pair of dragon hide gloves."
Hagrid, Do they mean from a real dragon?

20:07.100 --> 20:10.600
They don't mean a penguin, do they?

20:11.400 --> 20:15.800
- Crikey. I'd love a dragon.
- You'd like a dragon?

20:16.000 --> 20:21.900
Vastly misunderstood beasts, Harry.
Vastly misunderstood.

20:27.600 --> 20:31.099
"All students must be equipped with...

20:31.100 --> 20:34.299
...one standard size 2
pewter cauldron...

20:34.300 --> 20:40.299
...and may bring, if they desire,
either an owl, a cat or a toad."

20:40.300 --> 20:43.099
Can we find all this in London?

20:43.100 --> 20:45.800
If you know where to go.

21:08.300 --> 21:11.399
Ah, Hagrid! The usual, I presume?

21:11.400 --> 21:15.499
No, thanks, Tom.
I'm on official Hogwarts business.

21:15.500 --> 21:18.899
Just helping young Harry here
buy his school supplies.

21:18.900 --> 21:22.700
Bless my soul.
It's Harry Potter!

21:26.700 --> 21:30.399
Welcome back, Mr. Potter.
Welcome back.

21:30.400 --> 21:35.000
Doris Crockford, Mr Potter.
I can't believe I'm meeting you at last.

21:35.200 --> 21:40.599
Harry Potter. Can't tell you
how pleased I am to meet you.

21:40.600 --> 21:43.399
Hello, professor. I didn't see you there.

21:43.400 --> 21:48.599
Harry, This is Professor Quirrell. He will be your
Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher at Hogwarts.

21:48.600 --> 21:51.299
Oh, nice to meet you.

21:51.300 --> 21:54.499
Fearfully fascinating subject.

21:54.500 --> 21:59.500
Not that you need it, eh, Potter?

22:00.100 --> 22:04.499
Yes, well, must be going now.
Lots to buy.

22:04.500 --> 22:06.500
Goodbye.

22:08.900 --> 22:12.699
- See, Harry? You're famous.
- But why am I famous, Hagrid?

22:12.700 --> 22:16.399
All those people back there,
how is it they know who I am?

22:16.400 --> 22:20.500
I'm not sure I'm exactly the right person
to tell you that, Harry.

22:37.200 --> 22:41.300
Welcome, Harry, to Diagon Alley.

22:57.300 --> 23:00.099
Here's where you'll get your quills and your ink.

23:00.100 --> 23:04.300
And over there, all your bits and bobs
for doing your wizardry.

23:28.900 --> 23:31.299
It's a world-class racing broom.

23:31.300 --> 23:35.499
Look at it! The new Nimbus 2000!

23:35.500 --> 23:39.000
It's the fastest model yet.

23:42.500 --> 23:47.299
But, Hagrid, how am I to pay for all this?
I haven't any money.

23:47.300 --> 23:50.899
Well there's your money, Harry.
Gringotts, the wizard bank.

23:50.900 --> 23:56.600
Tain't no safer place, not one.
Except perhaps Hogwarts.

24:09.000 --> 24:13.199
Hagrid, what exactly
are these things?

24:13.200 --> 24:18.699
They're goblins, Harry. Clever as they come
goblins but not the most friendly of beasts.

24:18.700 --> 24:20.900
Best stay close.

24:24.700 --> 24:28.600
Mr. Harry Potter wishes
to make a withdrawal.

24:32.500 --> 24:36.000
And does Mr. Harry Potter
have his key?

24:36.700 --> 24:40.200
Oh, Wait a minute.
Got it here somewhere.

24:42.700 --> 24:45.799
Ha! Here's the little devil.

24:45.800 --> 24:49.000
Oh, and there's something else as well.

24:49.900 --> 24:53.500
Professor Dumbledore gave me this.

24:57.300 --> 25:02.700
It's about You-Know-What
in vault you-know-which.

25:03.700 --> 25:05.900
Very well.

25:10.800 --> 25:14.000
Vault 687.

25:15.600 --> 25:18.200
Lamp, please.

25:26.400 --> 25:28.000
Key, please.

25:51.200 --> 25:55.200
Didn't think your mum and dad
will leave you with nothing, now did ya?

25:56.200 --> 26:00.099
- Vault 713.
- What's in there, Hagrid?

26:00.100 --> 26:04.499
Can't tell you, Harry.
Hogwarts business. Very secret.

26:04.500 --> 26:06.400
Stand back.

26:34.400 --> 26:37.500
Best not to mention this to anyone, Harry.

26:45.600 --> 26:49.699
I still need... a wand.

26:49.700 --> 26:53.400
A wand? Well, you'll want Ollivanders.
There ain't no place better.

26:53.900 --> 26:59.300
Why don't you run along there and wait. I just
got one more thing I gotta do. Won't be long.

27:17.000 --> 27:19.100
Hello?

27:21.800 --> 27:23.900
Hello?

27:27.100 --> 27:31.700
I wondered when
I'd be seeing you, Mr. Potter.

27:39.200 --> 27:41.699
It seems only yesterday...

27:41.700 --> 27:47.800
...that your mother and father were
in here buying their first wands.

27:54.200 --> 27:56.800
Here we are.

28:05.100 --> 28:07.900
Give it a wave.

28:14.100 --> 28:16.900
Apparently not.

28:24.000 --> 28:26.600
Perhaps...

28:27.900 --> 28:30.400
...this.

28:37.100 --> 28:42.000
No, no, definitely not.
No matter.

28:49.000 --> 28:50.900
I wonder...

29:19.800 --> 29:22.299
Curious.

29:22.300 --> 29:25.399
Very curious.

29:25.400 --> 29:28.800
Sorry, but what's curious?

29:30.300 --> 29:33.799
I remember every wand
I've ever sold, Mr. Potter.

29:33.800 --> 29:36.699
It so happens that the phoenix...

29:36.700 --> 29:41.800
...whose tail feather resides
in your wand, gave another feather.

29:41.900 --> 29:45.099
Just one other.

29:45.100 --> 29:49.699
It is curious that you should
be destined for this wand...

29:49.700 --> 29:55.700
...when its brother
gave you that scar.

29:57.300 --> 30:00.800
And who owned that wand?

30:01.300 --> 30:04.000
We do not speak his name.

30:04.200 --> 30:07.899
The wand chooses
the wizard, Mr. Potter.

30:07.900 --> 30:11.200
It's not always clear why.

30:11.300 --> 30:14.999
But I think it is clear...

30:15.000 --> 30:19.099
...that we can expect
great things from you.

30:19.100 --> 30:23.599
After all, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named...

30:23.600 --> 30:26.499
...did great things.

30:26.500 --> 30:28.800
Terrible...

30:28.900 --> 30:32.500
...yes, but great.

30:37.800 --> 30:40.200
Harry! Harry!

30:40.300 --> 30:42.900
Happy birthday.

30:49.800 --> 30:53.600
You all right, Harry?
You seem very quiet.

30:53.700 --> 30:59.399
He killed my parents, didn't he?
The one who gave me this.

30:59.400 --> 31:03.400
You know, Hagrid. I know you do.

31:06.900 --> 31:11.699
First, and understand this Harry
because it's very important:

31:11.700 --> 31:14.499
Not all wizards are good.

31:14.500 --> 31:17.199
Some of them go bad.
A few years ago...

31:17.200 --> 31:22.399
...there was a one wizard who went as bad
as he can go. His name was V...

31:22.400 --> 31:26.199
- His name was V...
- Maybe if you wrote it down?

31:26.200 --> 31:28.299
No, I can't spell it.

31:28.300 --> 31:32.800
- All right, Voldemort.
- Voldemort?

31:36.500 --> 31:39.100
It was dark times, Harry. Dark times.

31:41.100 --> 31:44.499
Voldemort started
to gather some followers.

31:44.500 --> 31:48.100
Brought them over to the Dark Side.

31:49.100 --> 31:52.600
Anyone that stood up to him
ended up dead.

31:53.400 --> 31:56.699
Your parents fought against him.

31:56.700 --> 32:00.800
But nobody lived once
he decided to kill them.

32:04.800 --> 32:07.599
Nobody, not one.

32:07.600 --> 32:10.300
Except you.

32:12.000 --> 32:16.400
Me? Voldemort tried to kill me?

32:16.600 --> 32:21.099
Yes. That ain't no ordinary cut
on your forehead, Harry.

32:21.100 --> 32:26.999
A mark like that only comes from being
touched by a curse, and an evil curse at that.

32:27.000 --> 32:31.000
What happened to V...?
To You-Know-Who?

32:31.800 --> 32:35.399
Well, some say he died.

32:35.400 --> 32:37.999
Codswallop, in my opinion.

32:38.000 --> 32:41.499
Nope, I reckon he's out there still...

32:41.500 --> 32:44.599
...too tired to carry on.

32:44.600 --> 32:50.299
But one thing's absolutely certain. Something
about you stumped him that night.

32:50.300 --> 32:54.800
That's why you're famous.
That's why everybody knows your name.

32:55.000 --> 32:59.000
You're the boy who lived.

33:08.000 --> 33:11.000
What are you looking at?

33:12.500 --> 33:14.699
Blimey, is that the time?

33:14.700 --> 33:18.899
Sorry, Harry, I'm gonna have to leave you.
Dumbledore will be wanting his...

33:18.900 --> 33:23.999
Well, he'll be wanting to see me.
Now, uh, your train leaves in 10 minutes.

33:24.000 --> 33:29.600
Here's your ticket. Stick to it, Harry
that's very important. Stick to your ticket.

33:32.200 --> 33:34.699
Platform 9 3/4?

33:34.700 --> 33:39.699
But, Hagrid, there must be a mistake.
This says platform 9 3/4.

33:39.700 --> 33:43.300
There's no such thing, is there?

34:01.500 --> 34:03.400
Sorry.

34:04.600 --> 34:07.599
Excuse me. Excuse me.

34:07.600 --> 34:09.399
Right on your left Madam.

34:09.400 --> 34:13.399
Excuse me Sir, Can you tell me where
I might find platform 9 3/4?

34:13.400 --> 34:16.099
9 3/4? Think you're being funny, do ya?

34:16.100 --> 34:19.800
It's the same every year,
packed with Muggles, Of course. Come on!

34:19.900 --> 34:23.600
- Muggles?
- Platform 9 3/4, this way.

34:29.000 --> 34:32.400
All right, Percy, you first.

34:42.100 --> 34:43.498
Fred, you next.

34:43.500 --> 34:47.498
- He's not Fred, I am.
- Honestly, woman, you call yourself our mother?

34:47.500 --> 34:49.699
Oh, I'm sorry, George.

34:53.500 --> 34:56.300
I'm only joking. I am Fred.

35:01.800 --> 35:04.600
Excuse me.

35:05.400 --> 35:08.399
Could you tell me how to...?

35:08.400 --> 35:12.199
How to get onto the platform?
Not to worry, dear.

35:12.200 --> 35:14.899
It's Ron's first time
to Hogwarts as well.

35:14.900 --> 35:20.999
All you've got do is walk straight at the wall
between platforms 9 and 10.

35:21.000 --> 35:24.800
- Best do it at a bit of a run if you're nervous.
- Good luck.

36:22.100 --> 36:26.499
Excuse me. Do you mind?
Everywhere else is full.

36:26.500 --> 36:29.000
Not at all.

36:31.800 --> 36:34.499
I'm Ron, by the way.
Ron Weasley.

36:34.500 --> 36:37.400
I'm Harry. Harry Potter.

36:38.500 --> 36:40.699
So it's true!

36:40.700 --> 36:43.800
I mean, do you really have the...?

36:44.100 --> 36:47.300
- The what?
- The scar?

36:50.200 --> 36:52.700
Wicked!

36:54.800 --> 37:00.300
- Anything off the trolley, dears?
- No, thanks. I'm all set.

37:04.100 --> 37:06.600
We'll take the lot.

37:17.100 --> 37:22.200
- Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans?
- They mean every flavor.

37:22.300 --> 37:25.899
There's chocolate
and peppermint and there's also...

37:25.900 --> 37:29.899
...spinach, liver and tripe.

37:29.900 --> 37:34.400
George sweared he got
a bogey-flavoured one once!

37:38.700 --> 37:40.779
These aren't real
frogs, are they?

37:40.780 --> 37:44.299
It's just a spell. Besides,
It's the cards you want.

37:44.300 --> 37:50.100
Each pack's got a famous witch
or wizard. I've got about 500 meself.

37:51.300 --> 37:53.900
Watch it!

37:55.600 --> 37:59.800
Oh, that's rotten luck. They've only
got one good jump in them to begin with.

38:02.200 --> 38:06.400
- I've got Dumbledore!
- I got about six of him.

38:07.900 --> 38:09.699
Hey, he's gone!

38:09.700 --> 38:13.400
Well, you can't expect him to
hang around all day, can you?

38:13.700 --> 38:17.099
This is Scabbers, by the way.
Pathetic, isn't he?

38:17.100 --> 38:18.499
Just a little bit.

38:18.500 --> 38:21.999
Fred gave me a spell as
to turn him yellow. Want to see?

38:22.000 --> 38:24.400
Yeah.

38:30.800 --> 38:32.700
Has anyone seen a toad?

38:32.800 --> 38:35.800
- A boy named Neville's lost one.
- No.

38:36.100 --> 38:40.700
Oh, are you doing magic?
Let's see, then.

38:41.500 --> 38:45.999
Sunshine, daisies, butter mellow.

38:46.000 --> 38:49.400
Turn this stupid fat rat yellow.

38:51.900 --> 38:57.699
Are you sure that's a real spell?
Well, it's not very good, is it?

38:57.700 --> 39:01.199
Of course, I've only tried
a few simple ones myself...

39:01.200 --> 39:04.100
...but they've all worked for me.

39:07.400 --> 39:09.800
For example:

39:09.900 --> 39:12.900
Oculus Reparo.

39:14.700 --> 39:17.600
That's better, isn't it?

39:18.500 --> 39:22.699
Holy cricket, you're Harry Potter!

39:22.700 --> 39:26.500
I'm Hermione Granger.
And you are...?

39:26.900 --> 39:30.399
- I'm Ron Weasley.
- Pleasure.

39:30.400 --> 39:35.800
You two better change into robes.
I expect we'll be arriving soon.

39:39.600 --> 39:43.299
You've got dirt on your nose, by the way.
Did you know?

39:43.300 --> 39:45.500
Just there.

39:57.500 --> 40:01.599
Right, then.
First years, this way, please!

40:01.600 --> 40:07.100
Come on, now, first years, don't be shy.
Come on now, hurry up.

40:13.800 --> 40:17.000
- Hello, Harry.
- Hey, Hagrid.

40:17.800 --> 40:22.500
Right, then. This way to the boats.
Come on, now, follow me.

41:07.900 --> 41:10.000
Wicked.

41:37.800 --> 41:40.299
Welcome to Hogwarts.

41:40.300 --> 41:44.499
Now, in a few moments, you'll pass through
these doors and join your classmates.

41:44.500 --> 41:49.699
But before you can take your seats,
you must be sorted into your houses.

41:49.700 --> 41:53.099
They are Gryffindor, Hufflepuff...

41:53.100 --> 41:57.800
...Ravenclaw and Slytherin.

41:58.000 --> 42:03.300
Now, while you're here, your house
will be like your family.

42:03.700 --> 42:07.299
Your triumphs will earn you points.

42:07.300 --> 42:11.699
Any rule-breaking,
and you will lose points.

42:11.700 --> 42:17.299
At the end of the year, the house
with the most points is awarded the house cup.

42:17.300 --> 42:18.800
Trevor!

42:27.500 --> 42:29.299
Sorry.

42:29.300 --> 42:33.600
The Sorting Ceremony
will begin momentarily.

42:34.600 --> 42:38.200
It's true then,
what they're saying on the train.

42:38.300 --> 42:41.199
Harry Potter has come to Hogwarts.

42:41.200 --> 42:42.900
Harry Potter?

42:43.200 --> 42:46.099
This is Crabbe, and Goyle.

42:46.100 --> 42:48.699
And I'm Malfoy.

42:48.700 --> 42:51.400
Draco Malfoy.

42:53.000 --> 42:56.799
Think my name's funny, do you?
I've no need to ask yours.

42:56.800 --> 43:02.900
Red hair and a hand-me-down robe?
You must be a Weasley.

43:03.500 --> 43:07.799
We'll soon find out that some wizarding families
are better than others, Potter.

43:07.800 --> 43:11.799
You don't want to go making friends
with the wrong sort.

43:11.800 --> 43:14.300
I can help you there.

43:16.200 --> 43:20.300
I think I can tell the wrong sort
for myself, thanks.

43:25.700 --> 43:28.200
We're ready for you now.
Follow me.

43:46.500 --> 43:51.200
It's not real, the ceiling. It's just bewitched
to look like the night sky.

43:51.300 --> 43:54.500
I read about it
in Hogwarts: A History.

44:07.400 --> 44:10.600
All right, will you wait along here, please?

44:11.700 --> 44:14.699
Now, before we begin...

44:14.700 --> 44:18.099
...Professor Dumbledore would like
to say a few words.

44:18.100 --> 44:23.200
I have a few start-of-term notices
I wish to announce.

44:23.300 --> 44:25.699
The first years, please note...

44:25.700 --> 44:31.999
...that the Dark Forest is
strictly forbidden to all students.

44:32.000 --> 44:37.699
Also, our caretaker, Mr. Filch,
has asked me to remind you...

44:37.700 --> 44:42.599
...that the third-floor corridor on the
right hand side is out of bounds...

44:42.600 --> 44:47.200
...to everyone who does not wish
to die a most painful death.

44:48.200 --> 44:50.500
Thank you.

44:51.900 --> 44:56.199
When I call your name,
you will come forth.

44:56.200 --> 45:00.099
I shall place the Sorting Hat
on your head...

45:00.100 --> 45:03.499
...and you will be sorted
into your houses.

45:03.500 --> 45:06.400
Hermione Granger.

45:08.400 --> 45:11.300
Oh, no. Okay, relax.

45:11.400 --> 45:15.000
Mental, that one, I'm telling you.

45:20.200 --> 45:24.299
Ah, right then... hmm... right.

45:24.300 --> 45:28.200
Okay. Gryffindor!

45:36.700 --> 45:39.800
Draco Malfoy.

45:44.000 --> 45:46.600
Slytherin!

45:47.200 --> 45:50.299
There isn't a witch or wizard who went bad
who wasn't in Slytherin.

45:50.300 --> 45:53.200
Susan Bones.

46:01.400 --> 46:03.799
Harry, what is it?

46:03.800 --> 46:06.799
Nothing. Nothing, I'm fine.

46:06.800 --> 46:08.399
Let's see...

46:08.400 --> 46:13.100
I know! Hufflepuff!

46:14.500 --> 46:17.200
Ronald Weasley.

46:30.800 --> 46:36.100
Another Weasley!
I know just what to do with you.

46:36.500 --> 46:39.100
Gryffindor!

46:45.000 --> 46:47.800
Harry Potter.

47:05.600 --> 47:08.799
Hmm... difficult, very difficult.

47:08.800 --> 47:12.899
Plenty of courage, I see.
Not a bad mind, either.

47:12.900 --> 47:15.499
There's talent, oh, yes.

47:15.500 --> 47:19.499
And a thirst to prove yourself.

47:19.500 --> 47:22.000
But where to put you?

47:22.300 --> 47:24.999
Not Slytherin, not Slytherin!

47:25.000 --> 47:28.899
Not Slytherin, eh? Are you sure?

47:28.900 --> 47:33.899
You could be great, you know.
It's all here, in your head.

47:33.900 --> 47:39.599
And Slytherin will help you on the way
to greatnesses, no doubt about that.

47:39.600 --> 47:44.499
No? Well, if you're sure.

47:44.500 --> 47:46.399
Better be...

47:46.400 --> 47:48.700
...Gryffindor!

48:13.900 --> 48:17.000
Your attention, please.

48:18.700 --> 48:21.700
Let the feast begin.

48:38.400 --> 48:40.099
I'm half and half.

48:40.100 --> 48:43.599
Me dad's a Muggle. Mum's a witch.

48:43.600 --> 48:47.400
Bit of a nasty shock for him
when he found out.

48:48.100 --> 48:52.199
Say, Percy, who's that teacher
talking to Professor Quirrell?

48:52.200 --> 48:55.499
Oh, thats Professor Snape,
head of Slytherin house.

48:55.500 --> 48:57.699
- What's he teach?
- Potions.

48:57.700 --> 49:03.600
But everyone knows, its the Dark Arts he fancies.
He's been after Quirrell's job for years.

49:07.800 --> 49:10.399
Hello! How are you?

49:10.400 --> 49:14.000
Welcome to Gryffindor.

49:23.800 --> 49:26.600
Look, It's the Bloody Baron!

49:31.000 --> 49:33.999
Hello, Sir Nicholas.
Have a nice summer?

49:34.000 --> 49:39.700
Dismal. Once again, my request to join
the Headless Hunt has been denied.

49:42.400 --> 49:45.599
I know you.
You're Nearly Headless Nick.

49:45.600 --> 49:48.499
I prefer Sir Nicholas,
if you don't mind.

49:48.500 --> 49:52.300
"Nearly" headless?
How can you be nearly headless?

49:52.400 --> 49:54.600
Like this.

50:04.300 --> 50:08.399
Gryffindors, follow me please.
Keep up. Thank you.

50:08.400 --> 50:12.999
Ravenclaw, follow me. This way.

50:13.000 --> 50:16.299
This is the most direct path
to the dormitories.

50:16.300 --> 50:21.000
Oh, and keep an eye on the staircases.
They like to change.

50:29.800 --> 50:35.799
Keep up, please, and follow me.
Quickly now, come on. Come on.

50:35.800 --> 50:38.699
That picture's moving.

50:38.700 --> 50:42.500
- Look at that one.
- I think she fancies you.

50:43.900 --> 50:46.499
- Oh, look! Look!
- Who's that girl?

50:46.500 --> 50:49.400
Welcome to Hogwarts.

51:05.100 --> 51:07.000
Password?

51:07.100 --> 51:10.200
Caput Draconis.

51:16.700 --> 51:21.800
Follow me, everyone. Keep up.
Quickly, come on.

51:24.300 --> 51:27.000
Gather around here.

51:28.400 --> 51:31.899
Welcome to the Gryffindor common room.

51:31.900 --> 51:36.499
Boys' dormitory is upstairs and down to your left.
Girls, the same on your right.

51:36.500 --> 51:39.900
You'll find that your belongings have
already been brought up.

52:47.800 --> 52:49.699
Made it!

52:49.700 --> 52:54.400
Can you imagine the look on old
McGonagall's face if we were late?

52:57.300 --> 53:02.499
- That was bloody brilliant!
- Thank you for that assessment, Mr Weasley.

53:02.500 --> 53:04.974
Perhaps, lt'd be more useful
if I were to transfigure

53:05.000 --> 53:06.999
Mr. Potter and yourself
into a pocket-watch.

53:07.000 --> 53:10.399
- That way, one of you might be on time.
- We got lost.

53:10.400 --> 53:16.500
Then perhaps a map? I trust you
don't need one to find your seats.

53:24.400 --> 53:30.299
There will be no foolish wand-waving
or silly incantations in this class.

53:30.300 --> 53:34.099
As such, I don't expect
many of you to appreciate...

53:34.100 --> 53:38.099
...the subtle science and exact art
that is potion-making.

53:38.100 --> 53:41.400
However, for those select few...

53:42.100 --> 53:45.700
...who possess the predisposition...

53:49.100 --> 53:52.499
...l can teach you
how to bewitch the mind...

53:52.500 --> 53:55.699
...and ensnare the senses.

53:55.700 --> 53:58.499
I can tell you how to bottle fame...

53:58.500 --> 54:04.700
...brew glory and even
put a stopper in death.

54:08.400 --> 54:13.499
Then again, maybe some of you have
come to Hogwarts in...

54:13.500 --> 54:19.699
...possession of abilities so formidable that
you feel confident enough...

54:19.700 --> 54:22.900
...to not pay attention.

54:28.600 --> 54:31.500
Mr. Potter.

54:32.400 --> 54:36.500
Our new celebrity.

54:38.400 --> 54:44.500
Tell me, what would I get if I added powdered root
of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood?

54:47.500 --> 54:50.099
You don't know? Well, let's try again.

54:50.100 --> 54:55.000
Where, Mr Potter, would you look
if I asked you to find me a bezoar?

54:56.000 --> 54:57.699
I don't know, Sir.

54:57.700 --> 55:01.800
And what is the difference
between monkshood and wolfsbane?

55:04.100 --> 55:06.600
I don't know, Sir.

55:07.400 --> 55:09.000
Pity.

55:10.400 --> 55:14.900
Clearly, fame isn't everything...

55:15.300 --> 55:17.499
...is it, Mr. Potter?

55:17.500 --> 55:22.700
Clearly, Hermione knows.
Seems a pity not to ask her.

55:23.100 --> 55:26.000
Silence.

55:35.800 --> 55:39.100
Put your hand down,
you silly girl!

55:42.000 --> 55:44.999
For your information, Potter...

55:45.000 --> 55:47.669
...asphodel and wormwood
make a sleeping potion so

55:47.695 --> 55:50.599
powerful it is known as the
Draught of the Living Dead.

55:50.600 --> 55:56.199
A bezoar is a stone taken from the stomach of
a goat and it will save you from most poisons.

55:56.200 --> 56:03.100
As for monkshood and wolfsbane, they are the same
plant, which also goes by the name of aconite.

56:04.300 --> 56:06.900
Well...

56:07.100 --> 56:12.300
...why aren't you all
copying this down?

56:19.900 --> 56:22.599
And Gryffindors...

56:22.600 --> 56:27.099
...note that five points will
be taken from your house...

56:27.100 --> 56:29.700
...for your classmate's cheek.

56:46.800 --> 56:52.800
Eye of rabbit, harp string hum
Turn this water into rum.

56:53.700 --> 56:55.500
Eye of rabbit...

56:55.600 --> 56:58.499
What's Seamus trying to do
to that glass of water?

56:58.500 --> 57:03.500
Turn it into rum. Actually managed
a weak tea yesterday, before...

57:09.900 --> 57:12.100
Mail's here.

57:44.100 --> 57:47.400
Can I borrow this? Thanks.

57:51.000 --> 57:53.399
Hey, look! Neville's got a Remembrall.

57:53.400 --> 57:59.200
I've read about those. When the smoke turns
red, it means you've forgotten something.

57:59.300 --> 58:02.899
The only problem is, I can't remember
what I've forgotten.

58:02.900 --> 58:06.599
Hey Ron! Somebody broke into Gringotts.
Listen.

58:06.600 --> 58:10.499
"Believed to be the work
of Dark wizards or witches unknown...

58:10.500 --> 58:16.399
...Gringotts goblins while acknowledging
the breach, insist nothing was taken.

58:16.400 --> 58:22.299
The vault in question, number 713, had, in fact,
been emptied earlier that very same day."

58:22.300 --> 58:26.900
That's odd. That's the vault
Hagrid and I went to.

58:35.500 --> 58:39.499
- Good afternoon, class.
- Good afternoon, Madam Hooch.

58:39.500 --> 58:42.600
Good afternoon, Amanda.
Good afternoon.

58:43.600 --> 58:46.199
Welcome to your first flying lesson.

58:46.200 --> 58:50.399
Well, what are you waiting for? Everyone step
up to the left side of their broomstick.

58:50.400 --> 58:56.199
Come on now, hurry up. Stick your right hand
over the broom and say, "Up."

58:56.200 --> 58:58.399
Up!

58:58.400 --> 58:59.600
Up.

59:00.800 --> 59:02.900
Up.

59:04.300 --> 59:06.199
Up. Up!

59:06.200 --> 59:08.500
With feeling.

59:16.800 --> 59:19.199
Shut up, Harry.

59:19.200 --> 59:23.999
Now, once you've got hold of
your broom, I want you to mount it.

59:24.000 --> 59:28.300
And grip it tight, you don't wanna be
sliding off the end.

59:28.400 --> 59:33.599
When I blow my whistle, I want each of you
to kick off from the ground, hard.

59:33.600 --> 59:37.599
Keep your broom steady,
hover for a moment...

59:37.600 --> 59:42.199
...then lean forward slightly
and touch back down.

59:42.200 --> 59:45.600
On my whistle. Three, two...

59:47.800 --> 59:49.400
Mr. Longbottom.

59:53.800 --> 59:56.799
- Mr. Longbottom!
- Down, down!

59:56.800 --> 59:58.400
Neville!

01:00:01.800 --> 01:00:04.800
Come back down this instant!

01:00:33.400 --> 01:00:36.100
Everyone out of the way!

01:00:41.400 --> 01:00:43.899
Is he all right?

01:00:43.900 --> 01:00:49.900
Oh, dear, it's a broken wrist.
Poor boy. Come on now, up you get.

01:00:50.900 --> 01:00:55.799
Everyone's to keep their feet firmly on the ground
while I take Mr Longbottom to the hospital wing.

01:00:55.800 --> 01:00:59.599
Understand? If I see
a single broom in the air...

01:00:59.600 --> 01:01:05.099
...the one riding it will find themselves out
of Hogwarts before they can say, Quidditch.

01:01:05.100 --> 01:01:07.199
Did you see his face?

01:01:07.200 --> 01:01:11.299
Maybe if the fat lump had given this a squeeze,
he'd have remembered to fall on his fat arse.

01:01:11.300 --> 01:01:14.100
Give it here, Malfoy.

01:01:14.600 --> 01:01:18.600
No. I think I'll leave it somewhere
for Longbottom to find.

01:01:22.500 --> 01:01:25.300
How about on the roof?

01:01:26.100 --> 01:01:30.300
What's the matter, Potter?
Bit beyond your reach?

01:01:32.500 --> 01:01:36.499
Harry, no way!
You heard what Madam Hooch said.

01:01:36.500 --> 01:01:39.699
Besides, you don't even know how to fly.

01:01:39.700 --> 01:01:41.900
What an idiot.

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:48.799
Give it here or I'll
knock you off your broom!

01:01:48.800 --> 01:01:51.200
Is that so?

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:56.600
Have it your way, then.

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:32.899
- Nice going, Harry.
- That was wicked, Harry!

01:02:32.900 --> 01:02:35.200
Harry Potter!

01:02:35.900 --> 01:02:38.200
Follow me.

01:02:49.600 --> 01:02:52.100
You wait here.

01:02:53.600 --> 01:02:59.099
Professor Quirrell, excuse me.
Could I borrow Wood for a moment please?

01:02:59.100 --> 01:03:01.200
Oh, yes, of course.

01:03:06.600 --> 01:03:12.600
Potter, this is Oliver Wood.
Wood, I have found you a Seeker.

01:03:14.400 --> 01:03:18.199
Have you heard? Harry Potter's
the new Gryffindor Seeker.

01:03:18.200 --> 01:03:20.700
I always knew he'd do well.

01:03:20.800 --> 01:03:25.099
Seeker? But first years
never make their house teams.

01:03:25.100 --> 01:03:29.799
- You must be the youngest Quidditch player in...
- A century, according to McGonagall.

01:03:29.800 --> 01:03:32.599
Hey, well done, Harry.
Wood's just told us.

01:03:32.600 --> 01:03:35.399
Fred and George are on the team too.
Beaters.

01:03:35.400 --> 01:03:39.299
Our job is to make sure that you
don't get bloodied up too bad.

01:03:39.300 --> 01:03:42.199
Can't make any promises, of course.
Rough game, Quidditch.

01:03:42.200 --> 01:03:46.299
Brutal, But no one's died in years.
Someone will vanishes occasionally.

01:03:46.300 --> 01:03:49.299
But they'll turn up in a month or two.

01:03:49.300 --> 01:03:55.199
Oh, go on Harry. Quidditch is great. Best game
there is, and you'll be great too.

01:03:55.200 --> 01:03:58.700
But I've never even played Quidditch.
What if I make a fool of myself?

01:03:58.800 --> 01:04:03.900
You won't make a fool of yourself.
It's in your blood.

01:04:11.100 --> 01:04:16.300
Harry, you never told me your father
was a Seeker too.

01:04:16.800 --> 01:04:19.300
I didn't know.

01:04:23.500 --> 01:04:28.299
I'm telling you, it's spooky.
She knows more about you than you do.

01:04:28.300 --> 01:04:30.900
Who doesn't?

01:04:31.500 --> 01:04:33.899
What's happening?

01:04:33.900 --> 01:04:38.400
The staircases change, remember?

01:04:43.600 --> 01:04:48.300
- Let's go this way.
- Before the staircase moves again.

01:04:55.600 --> 01:04:59.299
Does anybody feel like
we shouldn't be here?

01:04:59.300 --> 01:05:01.599
We're not supposed to be here.

01:05:01.600 --> 01:05:05.900
This is the third floor.
It's forbidden.

01:05:06.700 --> 01:05:08.600
Let's go.

01:05:10.500 --> 01:05:13.700
- It's Filch's cat!
- Run!

01:05:17.200 --> 01:05:20.800
Quick, let's hide through that door!

01:05:25.700 --> 01:05:27.899
- It's locked!
- Thats it, We're done for!

01:05:27.900 --> 01:05:30.400
Oh, move over!

01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:33.500
Alohomora.

01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.300
Get in.

01:05:37.200 --> 01:05:38.499
Alohomora?

01:05:38.500 --> 01:05:41.299
Standard Book of Spells,
chapter seven.

01:05:41.300 --> 01:05:44.900
Anyone here, my sweet?

01:05:50.900 --> 01:05:52.200
Come on.

01:05:52.800 --> 01:05:55.499
- Filch is gone.
- Probably thinks this door's locked.

01:05:55.500 --> 01:05:59.400
- It was locked.
- And for good reason.

01:06:24.800 --> 01:06:30.499
What do they think they're doing? Keeping a thing
like that locked up in a school.

01:06:30.500 --> 01:06:34.399
You don't use your eyes, do you? Didn't you see
what it was standing on?

01:06:34.400 --> 01:06:38.699
I wasn't looking at its feet!
I was a bit preoccupied with its heads.

01:06:38.700 --> 01:06:41.799
Or maybe you didn't notice.
There were three!

01:06:41.800 --> 01:06:45.699
It was standing on a trap door.
Which means it wasn't there by accident.

01:06:45.700 --> 01:06:49.500
- It's guarding something.
- Guarding something?

01:06:49.700 --> 01:06:53.599
That's right. Now, if you two don't mind,
I'm going to bed...

01:06:53.600 --> 01:06:57.499
...before either of you come up with
another clever idea to get us killed.

01:06:57.500 --> 01:07:00.900
Or worse, expelled.

01:07:03.800 --> 01:07:08.400
She needs to sort out her priorities.

01:07:12.700 --> 01:07:17.199
Quidditch is easy enough to understand.
Each team has seven players.

01:07:17.200 --> 01:07:23.200
Three Chasers, two Beaters,
one Keeper and a Seeker. That's you.

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:32.299
There are three kinds of balls.
This one's called the Quaffle.

01:07:32.300 --> 01:07:38.499
Now, the Chasers handle the Quaffle and try
to put it through one of those three hoops.

01:07:38.500 --> 01:07:42.999
The Keeper, that's me,
defends the hoops. With me so far?

01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:47.800
I think so. What are those?

01:07:49.800 --> 01:07:52.300
You better take this.

01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:05.100
Careful now, it's coming back.

01:08:11.400 --> 01:08:15.300
Not bad, Potter.
You'd make a fair Beater.

01:08:31.700 --> 01:08:34.300
What was that?

01:08:34.700 --> 01:08:38.698
Bludger. Nasty little buggers.

01:08:38.700 --> 01:08:42.500
But you are a Seeker.

01:08:45.800 --> 01:08:50.599
The only thing I want you
to worry about is this.

01:08:50.600 --> 01:08:53.299
The Golden Snitch.

01:08:53.300 --> 01:08:56.599
- I like this ball.
- You like it now.

01:08:56.600 --> 01:09:00.799
Just wait. It's wicked fast
and damn near impossible to see.

01:09:00.800 --> 01:09:02.899
What do I do with it?

01:09:02.899 --> 01:09:06.399
You catch it.
Before the other team's Seeker.

01:09:06.399 --> 01:09:09.099
You catch this, the game's over.

01:09:09.100 --> 01:09:13.300
You catch this, Potter,
and we win.

01:09:22.100 --> 01:09:27.599
One of a wizard's most rudimentary
skills is levitation...

01:09:27.600 --> 01:09:31.799
...or the ability to make objects fly.

01:09:31.800 --> 01:09:34.499
Do you have your feathers? Good.

01:09:34.500 --> 01:09:39.799
Now, don't forget the nice wrist
movement we've been practicing.

01:09:39.800 --> 01:09:43.500
The swish and flick. Everyone.

01:09:43.700 --> 01:09:49.700
The swish and flick. Good.
Oh, and enunciate.

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:54.700
Wingardium Leviosa.
Off you go, then.

01:09:55.400 --> 01:09:58.199
Wingardium Leviosa.

01:09:58.200 --> 01:10:00.800
Wingardium Leviosa.

01:10:04.300 --> 01:10:08.799
No, stop, stop, stop! You're going
to take someone's eye out.

01:10:08.800 --> 01:10:15.100
Besides, you're saying it wrong.
It's Leviosa, not Leviosar.

01:10:15.400 --> 01:10:19.900
You do it then, if you're so clever.
Go on, go on.

01:10:20.800 --> 01:10:24.200
Wingardium Leviosa.

01:10:31.400 --> 01:10:37.299
Oh, well done! See here, everyone,
Miss Granger's done it!

01:10:37.300 --> 01:10:39.200
Splendid!

01:10:40.500 --> 01:10:43.000
Well done, dear.

01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:51.300
I think we're going to need
another feather over here, Professor.

01:10:57.500 --> 01:11:01.999
"It's Leviosa, not Leviosar."

01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:07.700
She's a nightmare, honestly!
No wonder she hasn't got any friends.

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:10.900
I think she heard you.

01:11:39.200 --> 01:11:41.599
Where's Hermione?

01:11:41.600 --> 01:11:44.899
Parvati Patil said that she wouldn't
come out of the girl's bathroom.

01:11:44.900 --> 01:11:49.300
She said that she'd been in there
all afternoon, crying.

01:11:53.400 --> 01:11:57.299
Troll! In the dungeon!

01:11:57.300 --> 01:12:00.900
Troll in the dungeon!

01:12:03.400 --> 01:12:06.100
Thought you ought to know.

01:12:12.600 --> 01:12:15.800
Silence!

01:12:17.100 --> 01:12:21.400
Everyone will please not panic!

01:12:21.800 --> 01:12:23.599
Now...

01:12:23.600 --> 01:12:28.400
...prefects will lead their house
back to the dormitories.

01:12:28.800 --> 01:12:33.900
Teachers will follow me
to the dungeons.

01:12:44.700 --> 01:12:48.099
Gryffindors, keep up, please,
and stay alert.

01:12:48.100 --> 01:12:49.999
How could a troll get in?

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:55.399
Not on its own. Trolls are really stupid.
Probably people playing jokes.

01:12:55.400 --> 01:12:59.700
- What?
- Hermione! She doesn't know.

01:13:11.500 --> 01:13:15.100
I think the troll's left the dungeon.

01:13:18.600 --> 01:13:21.100
It's going into the girl's bathroom.

01:13:51.800 --> 01:13:54.500
Hermione, move!

01:13:57.600 --> 01:14:02.000
Help! Help!

01:14:03.700 --> 01:14:06.100
Hey, pea brain!

01:14:18.200 --> 01:14:20.400
Help!

01:14:41.300 --> 01:14:43.900
Do something!

01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:49.300
- What?
- Anything!

01:14:49.600 --> 01:14:52.299
- Hurry up!
- Swish and flick.

01:14:52.300 --> 01:14:54.900
Wingardium Leviosa.

01:15:05.500 --> 01:15:07.800
Cool.

01:15:31.900 --> 01:15:34.999
Is it dead?

01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:39.200
I don't think so. Just knocked out.

01:15:45.200 --> 01:15:47.800
Troll bogies.

01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:53.799
Oh, my goodness!
Explain yourselves, both of you!

01:15:53.800 --> 01:15:58.700
- Well, what it is...
- It's my fault, Professor McGonagall.

01:16:00.600 --> 01:16:02.100
Miss Granger?

01:16:02.600 --> 01:16:07.899
I went looking for the troll.
I'd read about them and thought I could handle it.

01:16:07.900 --> 01:16:09.999
But I was wrong.

01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:15.400
If Harry and Ron hadn't come
and found me, I'd probably be dead.

01:16:16.100 --> 01:16:20.699
Be that as it may, it was
an extremely foolish thing to do.

01:16:20.700 --> 01:16:26.599
I would've expected more rational behavior on your
part and am very disappointed in you, Ms. Granger.

01:16:26.600 --> 01:16:29.799
Five points will be taken
from Gryffindor...

01:16:29.800 --> 01:16:33.700
...for your serious lack of judgment.

01:16:33.800 --> 01:16:35.999
As for you two gentlemen...

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:39.699
...l just hope you realize
how fortunate you are.

01:16:39.700 --> 01:16:43.299
Not many first-year students
could take on a full grown mountain troll...

01:16:43.300 --> 01:16:46.199
...and live to tell the tale.

01:16:46.200 --> 01:16:48.900
Five points...

01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:53.400
...will be awarded to each of you...

01:16:54.700 --> 01:16:58.100
...for sheer dumb luck.

01:17:03.400 --> 01:17:07.400
Perhaps you ought to go.
It might wake up.

01:17:16.500 --> 01:17:21.100
- Good of you to get us out of trouble like that.
- Mind you, we did save her life.

01:17:21.300 --> 01:17:25.899
Mind you, she might not have needed saving
if you hadn't insulted her.

01:17:25.900 --> 01:17:29.500
What are friends for?

01:17:31.300 --> 01:17:34.299
Take a bit of toast, mate. Go on.

01:17:34.300 --> 01:17:37.699
Ron's right, Harry.
You're gonna need your strength today.

01:17:37.700 --> 01:17:40.200
I'm not hungry.

01:17:40.500 --> 01:17:46.299
Good luck today, Potter. Then again, now
that you've proven yourself against a troll.

01:17:46.300 --> 01:17:49.699
A little game of Quidditch
should be easy work for you.

01:17:49.700 --> 01:17:53.100
Even if it is against Slytherin.

01:18:00.500 --> 01:18:04.200
- That explains the blood.
- Blood?

01:18:04.300 --> 01:18:08.699
Listen, last night, I'm guessing Snape let
the troll in as a diversion...

01:18:08.700 --> 01:18:11.499
...so he could try and get past that 3 headed dog.

01:18:11.500 --> 01:18:14.499
But, he got himself bitten,
that's why he's limping.

01:18:14.500 --> 01:18:17.100
But why would anyone go near that dog?

01:18:17.400 --> 01:18:20.899
The day I was at Gringotts, Hagrid took
something out of one of the vaults.

01:18:20.900 --> 01:18:24.299
He said it was Hogwarts business,
very secret.

01:18:24.300 --> 01:18:25.699
So you're saying...

01:18:25.700 --> 01:18:30.500
That's what the dog's guarding.
That's what Snape wants.

01:18:43.300 --> 01:18:47.600
- Bit early for mail, isn't it?
- But I never get mail.

01:18:47.800 --> 01:18:49.700
Let's open it.

01:18:59.500 --> 01:19:01.100
It's a broomstick.

01:19:01.600 --> 01:19:06.000
That's not just a broomstick, Harry,
it's a Nimbus 2000!

01:19:07.200 --> 01:19:09.500
But who...?

01:19:30.900 --> 01:19:33.599
- Scared, Harry?
- A little.

01:19:33.600 --> 01:19:37.499
That's all right. I felt the same way
before my first game.

01:19:37.500 --> 01:19:41.299
- What happened?
- Er, I don't really remember.

01:19:41.300 --> 01:19:44.099
I took a Bludger to the head
two minutes in.

01:19:44.100 --> 01:19:47.300
Woke up in the hospital a week later.

01:20:09.200 --> 01:20:12.699
Hello! Welcome to Hogwarts' first
Quidditch game of the season.

01:20:12.700 --> 01:20:17.800
Today's game,
Slytherin versus Gryffindor!

01:20:47.700 --> 01:20:50.399
The players take their positions
as madam Hooch...

01:20:50.400 --> 01:20:54.399
...steps out onto
the field to begin the game!

01:20:54.400 --> 01:20:58.000
Now, I want a nice, clean game...

01:20:58.400 --> 01:21:01.100
...from all of you!

01:21:05.900 --> 01:21:09.099
The Bludgers are up,
followed by the Golden Snitch.

01:21:09.100 --> 01:21:11.999
Remember, the Snitch
is worth 150 points.

01:21:12.000 --> 01:21:16.100
The Seeker who catches the Snitch
ends the game.

01:21:21.900 --> 01:21:26.300
The Quaffle is released
and the game begins!

01:21:44.700 --> 01:21:49.800
Angelina Johnson scores!
Ten points for Gryffindor!

01:21:54.700 --> 01:21:56.300
Well done!

01:22:00.400 --> 01:22:06.400
Slytherin takes possession of the Quaffle.
Bletchley passes to Captain Marcus Flint.

01:22:38.100 --> 01:22:41.200
Another 10 points to Gryffindor!

01:22:54.700 --> 01:22:56.900
Give me that!

01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:31.000
Take that side!

01:24:20.100 --> 01:24:23.700
What's going on
with Harry's broomstick?

01:24:32.300 --> 01:24:34.699
It's Snape.
He's jinxing the broom!

01:24:34.700 --> 01:24:39.400
- Jinxing the broom? What do we do?
- Leave it to me.

01:25:00.900 --> 01:25:02.700
Come on, Hermione!

01:25:16.500 --> 01:25:20.600
Lacarnum lnflamarae.

01:25:27.300 --> 01:25:30.700
Fire! You're on fire!

01:25:48.300 --> 01:25:50.700
Go, go, go, go!

01:26:42.400 --> 01:26:45.100
Looks like he's gonna be sick.

01:26:45.900 --> 01:26:47.499
He's got the Snitch!

01:26:47.500 --> 01:26:51.799
Harry Potter receives 150 points
for catching the Snitch!

01:26:51.800 --> 01:26:53.800
Gryffindor wins!

01:27:37.100 --> 01:27:41.499
Nonsense! Why would Snape
put a curse on Harry's broom?

01:27:41.500 --> 01:27:45.699
Who knows? Why was he trying
to get past that three-headed dog on Halloween?

01:27:45.700 --> 01:27:48.299
- Who told you about Fluffy?
- Fluffy?

01:27:48.300 --> 01:27:52.199
- That thing has a name?
- Of course he's got a name. He's mine.

01:27:52.200 --> 01:27:54.795
I bought him off an lrish feller
I met down at the pub last year.

01:27:54.796 --> 01:27:56.651
Then I lent him to
Dumbledore to guard the...

01:27:56.652 --> 01:27:57.352
Yes?

01:27:57.425 --> 01:27:59.375
Shouldn't have said that.
No more questions!

01:27:59.376 --> 01:28:02.625
Don't ask any more questions.
That's top-secret, that is.

01:28:02.700 --> 01:28:06.899
But Hagrid, whatever Fluffy's guarding,
Snape's trying to steal it.

01:28:07.100 --> 01:28:10.800
Codswallop. Professor Snape
is a Hogwarts teacher.

01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:16.299
Hogwarts teacher or not, I know a spell when
I see one. I've read all about them.

01:28:16.300 --> 01:28:20.099
You've got to keep eye contact,
and Snape wasn't blinking.

01:28:20.100 --> 01:28:22.700
Exactly.

01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:25.999
Now, you listen to me,
all three of you.

01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:30.899
You're meddling in things that ought
not to be meddled in. It's dangerous.

01:28:30.900 --> 01:28:36.199
What that dog is guarding is strictly
between Prof. Dumbledore and Nicholas Flamel.

01:28:36.200 --> 01:28:37.900
Nicholas Flamel?

01:28:38.600 --> 01:28:43.499
I shouldn't have said that.
I should not have said that.

01:28:43.500 --> 01:28:47.799
Nicholas Flamel.
Who's Nicholas Flamel?

01:28:47.800 --> 01:28:50.100
I don't know.

01:29:08.700 --> 01:29:11.699
Merry Christmas Merry Christmas.

01:29:11.700 --> 01:29:14.699
Ring the Hogwart bell.

01:29:14.700 --> 01:29:17.699
Merry Christmas Merry Christmas.

01:29:17.700 --> 01:29:21.000
Cast a Christmas spell.

01:29:34.300 --> 01:29:37.900
Knight to e5.

01:29:45.300 --> 01:29:47.800
Queen to e5.

01:29:53.100 --> 01:29:54.800
That's totally barbaric!

01:29:55.100 --> 01:29:58.899
That's wizard's chess.
I see you've packed.

01:29:58.900 --> 01:30:00.600
I see you haven't.

01:30:00.700 --> 01:30:06.099
Change of plans. My parents decided to go
to Romania to visit my brother, Charlie.

01:30:06.100 --> 01:30:10.099
- He's studying dragons there.
- Good. You can help Harry, then.

01:30:10.100 --> 01:30:13.699
He's going to go and look in the library
for information on Nicholas Flamel.

01:30:13.700 --> 01:30:17.500
We've looked a hundred times!

01:30:17.800 --> 01:30:23.400
Not in the restricted section.
Happy Christmas.

01:30:25.300 --> 01:30:28.500
I think we've had
a bad influence on her.

01:30:30.700 --> 01:30:35.400
Harry, wake up!
Come on, Harry, wake up!

01:30:44.900 --> 01:30:48.499
- Happy Christmas, Harry.
- Happy Christmas, Ron.

01:30:48.500 --> 01:30:51.000
What are you wearing?

01:30:51.300 --> 01:30:55.300
Oh, my mum made it.
Looks like you've got one too.

01:30:56.100 --> 01:30:58.800
- I've got presents?
- Yeah.

01:31:05.900 --> 01:31:08.300
There they are.

01:31:19.100 --> 01:31:22.799
"Your father left this
in my possession before he died.

01:31:22.800 --> 01:31:27.200
It is time it was returned to you.
Use it well."

01:31:43.700 --> 01:31:47.699
- What is it?
- Some kind of cloak.

01:31:47.700 --> 01:31:51.000
Well, let's see, then. Put it on.

01:31:56.100 --> 01:31:57.599
My body's gone!

01:31:57.600 --> 01:32:01.500
I know what that is.
That's an invisibility cloak!

01:32:01.700 --> 01:32:03.900
I'm invisible?

01:32:04.100 --> 01:32:08.800
They're really rare.
I wonder who gave it to you.

01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:14.100
There was no name.
It just said, "Use it well."

01:32:41.800 --> 01:32:47.899
Famous Fire-Eaters.
Fifteenth-Century Fiends.

01:32:47.900 --> 01:32:54.100
Flamel. Nicholas Flamel.
Where are you?

01:33:12.600 --> 01:33:14.800
Who's there?

01:33:20.600 --> 01:33:26.600
I know you're in there.
You can't hide.

01:33:33.600 --> 01:33:37.700
Who is it? Show yourself.

01:34:24.600 --> 01:34:26.200
Severus, I...

01:34:26.600 --> 01:34:30.699
You don't want me
as your enemy, Quirrell.

01:34:30.700 --> 01:34:35.700
- I don't know what you mean.
- You know perfectly well what I mean.

01:34:52.600 --> 01:34:56.099
We'll have another little chat soon.

01:34:56.100 --> 01:35:01.799
When you've had time to decide
where your loyalties lie.

01:35:01.800 --> 01:35:06.500
Professors. I found this
in the restricted section.

01:35:06.700 --> 01:35:12.100
It's still hot. That means
there's a student out of bed.

01:36:43.900 --> 01:36:46.000
Mum?

01:36:48.900 --> 01:36:51.200
Dad?

01:37:25.700 --> 01:37:31.000
Ron, you've really gotta see this!
Ron, you've gotta see this!

01:37:32.500 --> 01:37:35.599
Ron, Ron, come on, get out of bed!

01:37:35.600 --> 01:37:36.380
Why?

01:37:36.406 --> 01:37:39.525
There's something you've got to see.
Now, come on!

01:37:45.900 --> 01:37:50.500
Come on! Come!
Come look, it's my parents!

01:37:51.700 --> 01:37:53.899
I only see us.

01:37:53.900 --> 01:37:57.399
Look in properly.
Go on, stand there.

01:37:57.400 --> 01:38:03.600
- There. You see them, don't you?
- That's me! Only I'm head boy.

01:38:03.800 --> 01:38:06.399
And I'm holding the Quidditch Cup.

01:38:06.400 --> 01:38:10.900
And bloody hell!
I'm Quidditch captain too!

01:38:11.700 --> 01:38:14.500
I look good.

01:38:14.800 --> 01:38:18.799
Harry, do you think this mirror
shows the future?

01:38:18.800 --> 01:38:24.100
How can it?
Both my parents are dead.

01:38:37.400 --> 01:38:40.000
Do you like yours, Ron?

01:38:43.600 --> 01:38:47.900
- Ron?
- I'll be right back.

01:38:57.400 --> 01:39:00.999
- Wanna play chess?
- No.

01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:05.699
- Wanna go and visit Hagrid?
- No.

01:39:05.700 --> 01:39:09.499
Harry, I know what you're thinking,
but don't.

01:39:09.500 --> 01:39:13.700
There's something not right
about that mirror.

01:39:39.900 --> 01:39:42.400
Back again, Harry?

01:39:45.200 --> 01:39:47.899
I see that you,
like so many before you...

01:39:47.900 --> 01:39:52.399
...have discovered the delights
of the Mirror of Erised.

01:39:52.400 --> 01:39:56.900
I trust by now
you realize what it does.

01:39:57.900 --> 01:40:00.700
Let me give you a clue.

01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:03.299
The happiest man on earth...

01:40:03.300 --> 01:40:06.899
...would look into the mirror
and see only himself...

01:40:06.900 --> 01:40:09.399
...exactly as he is.

01:40:09.400 --> 01:40:14.699
So then, it shows us what we want.
Whatever we want.

01:40:14.700 --> 01:40:17.800
Yes. And no.

01:40:18.500 --> 01:40:21.099
It shows us nothing more or less...

01:40:21.100 --> 01:40:27.299
...than the deepest and most desperate
desires of our hearts.

01:40:27.300 --> 01:40:32.299
Now you, Harry, who have
never known your family...

01:40:32.300 --> 01:40:36.299
...you see them standing beside you.

01:40:36.300 --> 01:40:38.999
But remember this, Harry.

01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:45.099
This mirror gives us
neither knowledge...

01:40:45.100 --> 01:40:47.500
...or truth.

01:40:48.200 --> 01:40:54.500
Men have wasted away in front of it.
Even gone mad.

01:40:55.300 --> 01:40:59.599
That is why tomorrow
it will be moved to a new home.

01:40:59.600 --> 01:41:01.800
And I must ask you...

01:41:02.500 --> 01:41:06.700
...not to go looking for it again.

01:41:07.100 --> 01:41:10.600
It does not do to dwell on dreams, Harry...

01:41:10.800 --> 01:41:14.000
...and forget to live.

01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:12.300
Hi, Hedwig.

01:42:13.800 --> 01:42:17.899
Look at you, playing with your cards.
Pathetic!

01:42:17.900 --> 01:42:20.199
We've got final exams coming up soon.

01:42:20.200 --> 01:42:22.999
I'm ready. Ask me any question.

01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:27.499
Alright, what are the 3 most crucial ingredients
in a Forgetfulness Potion?

01:42:27.500 --> 01:42:28.999
I forgot.

01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:32.199
And what, may I ask, do you plan to do
if this comes up in the final exam?

01:42:32.200 --> 01:42:34.499
- Copy off you.
- No, you won't.

01:42:34.500 --> 01:42:37.444
Besides, according to Professor
McGonagall, we're to be

01:42:37.470 --> 01:42:40.599
given special quills bewitched
with an Anti-Cheating Spell.

01:42:40.600 --> 01:42:47.200
That's insulting! It's as if they
don't trust us! Dumbledore again!

01:42:50.600 --> 01:42:54.900
- Leg-Locker Curse?
- Malfoy.

01:42:59.800 --> 01:43:03.100
You have got to start
standing up to people, Neville.

01:43:03.200 --> 01:43:06.799
How? I can barely stand at all!

01:43:06.800 --> 01:43:09.100
I'll do the countercurse!

01:43:09.200 --> 01:43:13.599
No, that's all I need!
You to set my bloody kneecups on fire!

01:43:13.600 --> 01:43:17.199
I don't appreciate
the insinuation, Longbottom.

01:43:17.200 --> 01:43:20.599
Besides, if anyone cared to notice...

01:43:20.600 --> 01:43:25.200
...my eyebrows have
completely grown back!

01:43:28.300 --> 01:43:30.599
I found him!

01:43:30.600 --> 01:43:35.999
"Dumbledore is particularly famous for his
defeat of the dark wizard Grindelwald in 1945."

01:43:36.000 --> 01:43:36.680
Go on!

01:43:36.706 --> 01:43:39.399
"For the discovery of the
twelve uses of dragon blood...

01:43:39.400 --> 01:43:42.699
...and his work on alchemy with his
partner, Nicholas Flamel"!

01:43:42.700 --> 01:43:46.299
I knew the name sound familiar.
I read it on the train that day.

01:43:46.300 --> 01:43:48.900
Follow me!

01:43:52.400 --> 01:43:56.400
Hey! Wait! Where are you going?

01:43:57.900 --> 01:44:01.500
What about the countercurse?

01:44:02.700 --> 01:44:08.599
I had you looking in the wrong section.
How could I be so stupid?

01:44:08.600 --> 01:44:11.899
I checked this out weeks ago
for a bit of light reading.

01:44:11.900 --> 01:44:14.200
This is light?

01:44:18.500 --> 01:44:21.099
Of course! Here it is!

01:44:21.100 --> 01:44:25.399
Nicholas Flamel is the only known
maker of the Philosopher's Stone.

01:44:25.400 --> 01:44:26.800
The what?

01:44:27.200 --> 01:44:30.399
Honestly, don't you two read?

01:44:30.400 --> 01:44:35.099
"The Philosopher's Stone is a legendary
substance with astonishing powers.

01:44:35.100 --> 01:44:37.899
It'll transform any metal
into pure gold...

01:44:37.900 --> 01:44:42.199
...and produces the Elixir of Life
which will make the drinker immortal."

01:44:42.200 --> 01:44:44.499
- lmmortal?
- It means you'll never die.

01:44:44.500 --> 01:44:46.900
I know what it means!

01:44:47.500 --> 01:44:52.399
"The only Stone currently in existence
belongs to Mr. Nicholas Flamel...

01:44:52.400 --> 01:44:57.900
...the noted alchemist who last year
celebrated his 665th birthday."

01:44:59.300 --> 01:45:01.699
That's what Fluffy's guarding on the 3rd floor.

01:45:01.700 --> 01:45:06.700
That's what's under the trap door.
The Philosopher's Stone.

01:45:22.876 --> 01:45:23.576
Hagrid.

01:45:23.600 --> 01:45:27.199
Oh, hello, sorry, don't wish to be rude,
but I'm in no fit state to entertain today.

01:45:27.200 --> 01:45:30.200
We know about the Philosopher's Stone.

01:45:34.600 --> 01:45:36.642
We think Snape's
trying to steal it.

01:45:36.668 --> 01:45:39.899
Snape? Blimey, you're not
still on about him, are you?

01:45:39.900 --> 01:45:43.000
Hagrid, we know he's after the Stone.
We just don't know why.

01:45:43.100 --> 01:45:47.499
Snape is one of the teachers
protecting the Stone. He's not about to steal it.

01:45:47.500 --> 01:45:48.799
What?

01:45:48.800 --> 01:45:52.399
You heard. Right. Come on, now,
I'm a bit preoccupied today.

01:45:52.400 --> 01:45:55.299
Wait a minute.
"One of the teachers"?

01:45:55.300 --> 01:45:59.399
Of course! There are other things
defending the Stone, aren't there?

01:45:59.400 --> 01:46:02.299
- Spells, enchantments.
- That's right.

01:46:02.300 --> 01:46:05.499
Waste of bloody time, if you ask me.

01:46:05.500 --> 01:46:07.799
Ain't no one gonna get past Fluffy.

01:46:07.800 --> 01:46:11.699
Ain't a soul knows how,
except for me and Dumbledore.

01:46:11.700 --> 01:46:15.600
I shouldn't have told you that.
I should not have told you that.

01:46:29.100 --> 01:46:34.499
- Hagrid, what exactly is that?
- That? It's...

01:46:34.500 --> 01:46:36.699
I know what that is!

01:46:36.700 --> 01:46:39.600
But, Hagrid, how did you get one?

01:46:39.700 --> 01:46:43.199
I won it. Off a stranger
I met down at the pub.

01:46:43.200 --> 01:46:47.600
Seemed quite glad to be rid of it,
as a matter of fact.

01:47:09.500 --> 01:47:12.000
Is that...

01:47:12.500 --> 01:47:13.899
...a dragon?

01:47:13.900 --> 01:47:18.499
That's not just a dragon.
That's a Norwegian Ridgeback.

01:47:18.500 --> 01:47:21.599
My brother Charlie works
with these in Romania.

01:47:21.600 --> 01:47:26.800
Isn't he beautiful? Oh, bless him.
Look, he knows his mummy.

01:47:27.100 --> 01:47:29.199
Hello, Norbert.

01:47:29.200 --> 01:47:33.800
- Norbert?
- Yeah, well, he's gotta have a name, don't he?

01:47:34.300 --> 01:47:37.000
Don't you, Norbert?

01:47:43.700 --> 01:47:47.100
He'll have to be trained up a bit,
of course.

01:47:50.700 --> 01:47:53.100
Who's that?

01:47:54.500 --> 01:47:56.900
Malfoy.

01:47:57.300 --> 01:47:59.000
Oh, dear.

01:48:00.500 --> 01:48:05.499
Hagrid always wanted a dragon.
He told me so the first time I met him.

01:48:05.500 --> 01:48:09.699
It's crazy.
And worse, Malfoy knows.

01:48:09.700 --> 01:48:14.099
- I don't understand. ls that bad?
- It's bad.

01:48:14.100 --> 01:48:16.600
Good evening.

01:48:19.900 --> 01:48:23.099
Nothing, I repeat, nothing...

01:48:23.100 --> 01:48:26.799
...gives a student the right
to walk about the school at night.

01:48:26.800 --> 01:48:31.899
Therefore, as punishment for your actions,
50 points will be taken.

01:48:31.900 --> 01:48:34.500
- 50?!
- Each.

01:48:35.200 --> 01:48:37.799
And to ensure it doesn't happen again...

01:48:37.800 --> 01:48:41.400
...all four of you
will receive detention.

01:48:42.100 --> 01:48:45.299
Excuse me, professor,
perhaps I heard you wrong.

01:48:45.300 --> 01:48:47.799
I thought you said the four of us.

01:48:47.800 --> 01:48:50.499
No, you heard me correctly, Mr. Malfoy.

01:48:50.500 --> 01:48:55.800
You see, honorable as your intentions were,
you too were out of bed after hours.

01:48:56.000 --> 01:48:59.200
You will join your classmates
in detention.

01:49:10.100 --> 01:49:14.299
A pity they let
the old punishments die.

01:49:14.300 --> 01:49:19.299
There was a time detention would find you
hanging by your thumbs in the dungeons.

01:49:19.300 --> 01:49:22.400
God, I miss the screaming.

01:49:24.700 --> 01:49:28.199
You'll be serving detention
with Hagrid tonight.

01:49:28.200 --> 01:49:33.800
He's got a little job to do
inside the Dark Forest.

01:49:35.600 --> 01:49:38.800
A sorry lot, this, Hagrid.

01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:45.300
Oh, good God, man, you're not still on
about that bloody dragon, are you?

01:49:47.300 --> 01:49:49.600
Norbert's gone.

01:49:49.900 --> 01:49:53.699
Dumbledore sent him off to Romania
to live in a colony.

01:49:53.700 --> 01:49:57.099
Well, that's good, isn't it?
He'll be with his own kind.

01:49:57.100 --> 01:49:59.699
Yeah, but what if he don't like Romania?

01:49:59.700 --> 01:50:04.200
What if the other dragons are mean
to him? He's only a baby, after all.

01:50:04.600 --> 01:50:10.099
Oh, for God's sake, pull yourself together, man.
You're going into the Forest, after all.

01:50:10.100 --> 01:50:12.599
Got to have your wits about you.

01:50:12.600 --> 01:50:18.600
The Forest? I thought that was a joke.
We can't go in there.

01:50:18.700 --> 01:50:22.900
Students aren't allowed.
And there are...

01:50:24.100 --> 01:50:25.700
...werewolves.

01:50:25.800 --> 01:50:29.299
There's more than werewolves
in those trees, lad.

01:50:29.300 --> 01:50:32.300
You can be sure of that.

01:50:33.900 --> 01:50:35.600
Nighty-night.

01:50:37.900 --> 01:50:41.100
Right. Let's go.

01:51:19.000 --> 01:51:21.599
Hagrid, what is that?

01:51:21.600 --> 01:51:25.300
What we're here for.
See that?

01:51:25.500 --> 01:51:31.200
That's unicorn blood, that is.
I found one dead a few weeks ago.

01:51:31.400 --> 01:51:36.300
Now, this one's been hurt bad
by something.

01:51:43.500 --> 01:51:49.499
So, it's our job to go
and find the poor beast.

01:51:49.500 --> 01:51:52.900
Ron, Hermione, you'll come with me.

01:51:53.100 --> 01:51:56.600
And, Harry, you'll go with Malfoy.

01:51:57.600 --> 01:52:00.099
Okay. Then I get Fang.

01:52:00.100 --> 01:52:06.100
Fine. Just so you know,
he's a bloody coward.

01:52:09.500 --> 01:52:14.699
You wait till my father hears about this.
This is servant's stuff.

01:52:14.700 --> 01:52:18.799
If I didn't know better, Draco,
I'd say you were scared.

01:52:18.800 --> 01:52:21.700
I'm not scared, Potter.

01:52:22.500 --> 01:52:24.800
Did you hear that?

01:52:27.100 --> 01:52:28.699
Come on, Fang.

01:52:28.700 --> 01:52:30.500
Scared!

01:52:55.200 --> 01:52:57.600
What is it, Fang?

01:54:07.700 --> 01:54:13.399
Harry Potter, you must leave.
You are known to many creatures here.

01:54:13.400 --> 01:54:17.599
The Forest is not safe at this time.
Especially for you.

01:54:17.600 --> 01:54:20.599
What was that thing you saved me from?

01:54:20.600 --> 01:54:26.099
A monstrous creature.
It is a terrible crime to slay a unicorn.

01:54:26.100 --> 01:54:31.899
Drinking the blood of a unicorn will keep
you alive even if you are an inch from death.

01:54:31.900 --> 01:54:37.199
But at a terrible price. You
have slain something so pure...

01:54:37.200 --> 01:54:42.199
...that from the moment the blood touches
your lips, you will have a half-life.

01:54:42.200 --> 01:54:44.199
A cursed life.

01:54:44.200 --> 01:54:48.399
- But who would choose such a life?
- Can you think of no one?

01:54:48.400 --> 01:54:53.699
Do you mean to say that
thing that killed the unicorn...

01:54:53.700 --> 01:54:57.799
...that was drinking its blood,
that was Voldemort?

01:54:57.800 --> 01:55:03.300
Do you know what is hidden
in the school at this very moment, Mr. Potter?

01:55:03.800 --> 01:55:05.700
The Philosopher's Stone.

01:55:06.700 --> 01:55:09.000
Harry!

01:55:09.300 --> 01:55:13.999
Hello there, Firenze.
See you've met our young Mr. Potter.

01:55:14.000 --> 01:55:16.500
You all right there, Harry?

01:55:17.300 --> 01:55:21.900
Harry Potter,
this is where I leave you.

01:55:22.500 --> 01:55:26.600
You're safe now. Good luck.

01:55:33.900 --> 01:55:38.299
You mean, You-Know-Who is out there
right now in the Forest?

01:55:38.300 --> 01:55:41.299
But he's weak.
He's living off the unicorns.

01:55:41.300 --> 01:55:44.399
Don't you see? We had it wrong.

01:55:44.400 --> 01:55:48.999
Snape doesn't want the Stone for himself.
He wants the stone for Voldemort.

01:55:49.000 --> 01:55:53.699
With the Elixir of Life,
Voldemort will be strong again.

01:55:53.700 --> 01:55:55.499
He'll come back.

01:55:55.500 --> 01:55:57.499
But if he comes back...

01:55:57.500 --> 01:56:01.800
...you don't think he'll try
to kill you, do you?

01:56:02.500 --> 01:56:06.299
I think if he'd had the chance,
he might have tried to kill me tonight.

01:56:06.300 --> 01:56:10.099
And to think, I've been worrying
about my Potions final.

01:56:10.100 --> 01:56:13.999
Hang on a minute.
We're forgetting one thing.

01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:19.200
Who's the one wizard
Voldemort always feared?

01:56:19.700 --> 01:56:24.999
Dumbledore. As long as Dumbledore
is around, Harry, you're safe.

01:56:25.000 --> 01:56:29.400
As long as Dumbledore is around,
you can't be touched.

01:56:34.800 --> 01:56:40.399
I'd always heard Hogwarts' end of the year exams
were frightful, but I found that rather enjoyable.

01:56:40.400 --> 01:56:44.299
Speak for yourself.
All right there, Harry?

01:56:44.300 --> 01:56:49.699
- My scar. It keeps burning.
- It's happened before.

01:56:49.700 --> 01:56:52.599
- Not like this.
- Perhaps you should see the nurse.

01:56:52.600 --> 01:56:56.400
I think it's a warning.
It means danger's coming.

01:57:03.700 --> 01:57:06.399
- Of course!
- What is it?

01:57:06.400 --> 01:57:10.299
Don't you think it's a bit odd that what
Hagrid wants more than anything is a dragon...

01:57:10.300 --> 01:57:13.599
...and a stranger turns up who
just happens to have one?

01:57:13.600 --> 01:57:16.499
I mean, how many people wander around
with dragon eggs in their pockets?

01:57:16.500 --> 01:57:19.100
Why didn't I see it before?

01:57:24.300 --> 01:57:28.099
Hagrid, who gave you the dragon egg?
What did he look like?

01:57:28.100 --> 01:57:30.999
I don't know, I never saw his face.
He kept his hood up.

01:57:31.000 --> 01:57:33.900
The stranger, though, You and he
must have talked.

01:57:34.200 --> 01:57:37.899
Well, he wanted to know what sort
of creatures I looked after.

01:57:37.900 --> 01:57:42.099
I told him. I said, "After Fluffy,
a dragon's gonna be no problem."

01:57:42.100 --> 01:57:46.900
- And did he seem interested in Fluffy?
- Well, of course he was interested in Fluffy.

01:57:47.000 --> 01:57:51.399
How often do you come across a
three-headed dog, even if you're in the trade?

01:57:51.400 --> 01:57:57.299
But I told him. I said, "The trick with any beast
is to know how to calm him."

01:57:57.300 --> 01:58:03.000
Take Fluffy, for example. Just play him a bit of
music and he falls straight to sleep.

01:58:04.300 --> 01:58:07.299
I shouldn't have told you that.

01:58:07.300 --> 01:58:09.800
Where are you going? Wait!

01:58:16.500 --> 01:58:19.600
We have to see Professor Dumbledore.
Immediately!

01:58:19.700 --> 01:58:22.599
I'm afraid Professor Dumbledore is not here.

01:58:22.600 --> 01:58:27.299
He received an urgent owl from the
Ministry of Magic and left immediately for London.

01:58:27.300 --> 01:58:30.099
He's gone? Now?
But this is important!

01:58:30.100 --> 01:58:32.600
This is about the Philosopher's Stone!

01:58:34.200 --> 01:58:38.200
- How do you know...?
- Someone's going to try and steal it.

01:58:38.500 --> 01:58:41.383
I don't know how you three
found out about the stone,

01:58:41.409 --> 01:58:43.999
but I assure you it is
perfectly well protected.

01:58:44.000 --> 01:58:48.600
Now would you go back
to your dormitories? Quietly.

01:58:56.600 --> 01:58:59.599
That was no stranger Hagrid met in the village.
It was Snape.

01:58:59.600 --> 01:59:02.499
Which means he knows
how to get past Fluffy.

01:59:02.500 --> 01:59:06.600
- And with Dumbledore gone...
- Good afternoon.

01:59:08.400 --> 01:59:11.699
Now, what would three young
Gryffindors such as yourselves...

01:59:11.700 --> 01:59:16.300
...be doing inside on a day like this?

01:59:20.700 --> 01:59:24.600
- We were just...
- You ought to be careful.

01:59:24.900 --> 01:59:27.100
People will think you're...

01:59:31.100 --> 01:59:34.100
...up to something.

01:59:44.100 --> 01:59:46.299
Now what do we do?

01:59:46.300 --> 01:59:50.400
We go down the trap door. Tonight.

02:00:03.900 --> 02:00:05.599
Trevor.

02:00:05.600 --> 02:00:09.299
Trevor, shh! go! You shouldn't be here!

02:00:09.300 --> 02:00:14.899
Neither should you.
You're sneaking out again, aren't you?

02:00:14.900 --> 02:00:19.099
- Now, Neville, listen. We were...
- No, I won't let you!

02:00:19.100 --> 02:00:23.899
You'll get Gryffindor into trouble again.
I'll fight you.

02:00:23.900 --> 02:00:28.600
Neville, I'm really really sorry about this.
Petrificus Totalus.

02:00:36.200 --> 02:00:40.299
You're a little scary sometimes,
you know that?

02:00:40.300 --> 02:00:44.200
Brilliant, but scary.

02:00:44.500 --> 02:00:46.799
Let's go.

02:00:46.800 --> 02:00:51.400
- Sorry.
- It's for your own good, you know.

02:00:56.500 --> 02:01:00.800
- Ow! You stood on my foot!
- Sorry.

02:01:04.300 --> 02:01:06.700
Alohomora.

02:01:18.400 --> 02:01:21.200
Wait a minute. He's...

02:01:22.200 --> 02:01:24.600
...snoring.

02:01:26.900 --> 02:01:32.700
Snape's already been here.
He's put a spell on the harp.

02:01:34.000 --> 02:01:37.300
It's got horrible breath.

02:01:39.600 --> 02:01:41.899
- We have to move its paw.
- What?

02:01:41.900 --> 02:01:43.600
Come on!

02:01:47.300 --> 02:01:49.700
Okay. Push.

02:02:12.500 --> 02:02:16.399
I'll go first. Don't follow
until I give you a sign.

02:02:16.400 --> 02:02:21.700
If something bad happens,
get yourselves out.

02:02:22.200 --> 02:02:26.000
Does it seem a bit quiet to you?

02:02:26.300 --> 02:02:28.500
The harp.

02:02:28.900 --> 02:02:31.900
It's stopped playing.

02:02:41.600 --> 02:02:43.000
Jump!

02:02:56.900 --> 02:03:00.800
Lucky this plant thing's here, really.

02:03:15.000 --> 02:03:18.299
Stop moving, both of you.
This is Devil's Snare.

02:03:18.300 --> 02:03:22.199
You have to relax. If you don't,
it will only kill you faster.

02:03:22.200 --> 02:03:27.500
Kill us faster?
Oh, now I can relax!

02:03:29.500 --> 02:03:31.100
Hermione!

02:03:31.400 --> 02:03:35.399
- Now what are we gonna do?
- Just relax!

02:03:35.400 --> 02:03:40.200
- Hermione, where are you?
- Do what I say! Trust me.

02:03:47.000 --> 02:03:50.499
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

02:03:50.500 --> 02:03:53.799
- He's not relaxing, is he?
- Apparently not.

02:03:53.800 --> 02:03:56.499
- We've gotta do something.
- What?

02:03:56.500 --> 02:03:59.800
I remember reading something
in Herbology.

02:04:00.300 --> 02:04:04.399
Devil's Snare, Devil's Snare.
It's deadly fun...

02:04:04.400 --> 02:04:08.999
...but will sulk in the sun!
That's it! Devil Snare hates sunlight.

02:04:09.000 --> 02:04:11.400
Lumus Solem.

02:04:19.100 --> 02:04:22.000
- Ron, you okay?
- Yeah.

02:04:24.400 --> 02:04:27.200
Lucky we didn't panic.

02:04:27.700 --> 02:04:31.400
Lucky Hermione pays attention
in Herbology.

02:04:32.800 --> 02:04:34.499
What is that?

02:04:34.500 --> 02:04:38.500
I don't know. Sounds like wings.

02:04:51.300 --> 02:04:54.999
Curious. I've never seen
birds like these.

02:04:55.000 --> 02:04:58.899
They're not birds.
They're keys.

02:04:58.900 --> 02:05:02.600
And I'll bet one of them
fits that door.

02:05:05.800 --> 02:05:10.700
- What's this all about?
- I don't know.

02:05:16.300 --> 02:05:18.600
Strange.

02:05:18.700 --> 02:05:21.300
Alohomora!

02:05:24.000 --> 02:05:26.499
Well, it was worth a try.

02:05:26.500 --> 02:05:29.899
What're we going to do?
There must be a thousand keys up there.

02:05:29.900 --> 02:05:34.099
We're looking for a big old fashioned one.
Probably rusty like the handle.

02:05:34.100 --> 02:05:37.800
There! I see it!
The one with the broken wing.

02:05:41.100 --> 02:05:43.700
What's wrong, Harry?

02:05:44.300 --> 02:05:45.999
It's too simple.

02:05:46.000 --> 02:05:50.899
Oh, go on, Harry! If Snape could catch it
on that old broomstick, you can.

02:05:50.900 --> 02:05:54.800
You're the youngest Seeker
in a century.

02:06:11.300 --> 02:06:14.600
This complicates things a bit.

02:06:35.600 --> 02:06:37.800
Catch the key!

02:06:41.900 --> 02:06:44.200
Hurry up!

02:07:16.300 --> 02:07:21.199
I don't like this.
I don't like this at all.

02:07:21.200 --> 02:07:24.700
Where are we? A graveyard.

02:07:24.800 --> 02:07:27.700
This is no graveyard.

02:07:34.900 --> 02:07:38.100
It's a chessboard.

02:07:49.800 --> 02:07:52.000
There's the door.

02:08:03.800 --> 02:08:05.600
Now what do we do?

02:08:05.700 --> 02:08:10.100
It's obvious, isn't it? We've got
to play our way across the room.

02:08:10.400 --> 02:08:14.400
Alright. Harry, you take
the empty bishop's square.

02:08:14.500 --> 02:08:18.899
Hermione, you'll be
the queen-side castle.

02:08:18.900 --> 02:08:23.300
As for me, I'll be a knight.

02:08:30.100 --> 02:08:32.200
What happens now?

02:08:32.700 --> 02:08:35.899
Well, white moves first.

02:08:35.900 --> 02:08:38.000
And then...

02:08:39.500 --> 02:08:41.000
...we play.

02:08:51.300 --> 02:08:56.599
Ron, you don't suppose
this is going to be like...

02:08:56.600 --> 02:09:00.499
...real wizard's chess, do you?

02:09:00.500 --> 02:09:03.800
You there, d5.

02:09:18.100 --> 02:09:19.899
Yes, Hermione.

02:09:19.900 --> 02:09:25.300
I think this is gonna be
exactly like wizard's chess.

02:09:30.900 --> 02:09:33.700
Castle to e4!

02:09:37.000 --> 02:09:39.600
Pawn to c3!

02:10:24.000 --> 02:10:28.199
- Wait a minute.
- You understand right, Harry.

02:10:28.200 --> 02:10:33.200
Once I make my move,
the queen will take me.

02:10:33.500 --> 02:10:36.099
Then you're free to check the king.

02:10:36.100 --> 02:10:39.100
- No. Ron, no!
- What is it?

02:10:39.400 --> 02:10:44.299
- He's going to sacrifice himself.
- No, you can't! there must be another way!

02:10:44.300 --> 02:10:48.299
Do you wanna stop Snape
from getting that Stone or not?

02:10:48.300 --> 02:10:52.200
Harry, it's you that has to go on.
I know it.

02:10:52.400 --> 02:10:55.400
Not me. Not Hermione. You.

02:11:05.400 --> 02:11:08.600
Knight to h3.

02:11:29.200 --> 02:11:31.500
Check.

02:12:00.400 --> 02:12:02.399
Ron!

02:12:02.400 --> 02:12:08.500
No, don't move!
Don't forget, we're still playing.

02:12:23.300 --> 02:12:24.800
Checkmate.

02:12:44.500 --> 02:12:47.199
Take care of Ron.
Then go to the owlery.

02:12:47.200 --> 02:12:51.299
Send a message to Dumbledore.
Ron's right.

02:12:51.300 --> 02:12:53.400
I have to go on.

02:12:53.700 --> 02:12:59.799
You'll be okay, Harry.
You're a great wizard. You really are.

02:12:59.800 --> 02:13:02.600
Not as good as you.

02:13:03.100 --> 02:13:08.200
Me? Books and cleverness.
There are more important things.

02:13:09.200 --> 02:13:15.100
Friendship and bravery.
And, Harry, just be careful.

02:13:52.900 --> 02:13:54.800
You?

02:13:55.300 --> 02:13:59.399
No, it can't be.
Snape, he was the...

02:13:59.400 --> 02:14:02.599
Yes, he does seem the type,
doesn't he?

02:14:02.600 --> 02:14:05.999
Next to him, who would suspect...

02:14:06.000 --> 02:14:10.099
...poor, stuttering
Professor Quirrell?

02:14:10.100 --> 02:14:15.699
But that day, during the Quidditch match,
Snape tried to kill me.

02:14:15.700 --> 02:14:18.800
No, dear boy. I tried to kill you!

02:14:19.000 --> 02:14:23.399
And trust me, if Snape's cloak hadn't caught
fire and broken my eye contact...

02:14:23.400 --> 02:14:25.799
...l would have succeeded.

02:14:25.800 --> 02:14:28.999
Even with Snape muttering
his little countercurse.

02:14:29.000 --> 02:14:31.399
Snape was trying to save me?

02:14:31.400 --> 02:14:36.999
I knew you were a danger to me right from the off.
Especially after Halloween.

02:14:37.000 --> 02:14:41.399
- Then you let the troll in!
- Very good, Potter, yes.

02:14:41.400 --> 02:14:44.700
Snape, unfortunately, wasn't fooled.

02:14:45.000 --> 02:14:50.300
While everyone else was running about dungeon,
he went to the third floor to head me off.

02:14:50.900 --> 02:14:54.700
He, of course, never trusted me again.

02:14:55.400 --> 02:15:00.899
He rarely left me alone.
But he doesn't understand.

02:15:00.900 --> 02:15:05.099
I'm never alone. Never.

02:15:05.100 --> 02:15:09.500
Now, what does this mirror do?

02:15:10.800 --> 02:15:13.200
I see what I desire.

02:15:13.500 --> 02:15:18.099
I see myself holding the Stone.
But how do I get it?

02:15:18.100 --> 02:15:20.600
Use the boy.

02:15:21.100 --> 02:15:25.300
Come here, Potter! Now!

02:15:37.100 --> 02:15:41.400
Tell me, what do you see?

02:16:06.200 --> 02:16:08.899
What is it? What do you see?

02:16:08.900 --> 02:16:14.199
I'm shaking hands with Dumbledore.
I've won the house cup.

02:16:14.200 --> 02:16:16.100
He lies.

02:16:16.300 --> 02:16:20.199
Tell the truth! What do you see?

02:16:20.200 --> 02:16:24.799
- Let me speak to him.
- Master, you are not strong enough.

02:16:24.800 --> 02:16:29.100
I have strength enough for this.

02:16:47.000 --> 02:16:50.099
Harry Potter...

02:16:50.100 --> 02:16:52.699
...we meet again.

02:16:52.700 --> 02:16:54.299
Voldemort.

02:16:54.299 --> 02:16:58.499
Yes. You see what I've become?

02:16:58.500 --> 02:17:02.299
See what I must do to survive?

02:17:02.299 --> 02:17:06.700
Live off another. A mere parasite.

02:17:07.100 --> 02:17:10.599
Unicorn blood can sustain me...

02:17:10.600 --> 02:17:14.499
...but it cannot give me
a body of my own.

02:17:14.500 --> 02:17:18.299
But there is something that can.

02:17:18.299 --> 02:17:24.200
Something that, conveniently enough,
lies in your pocket.

02:17:24.299 --> 02:17:26.200
Stop him!

02:17:30.900 --> 02:17:34.000
Don't be a fool.

02:17:34.100 --> 02:17:37.499
Why suffer an horrific death...

02:17:37.500 --> 02:17:41.299
...when you can join me and live?

02:17:41.299 --> 02:17:42.700
Never!

02:17:44.400 --> 02:17:49.500
Bravery. Your parents had it too.

02:17:49.900 --> 02:17:53.499
Tell me, Harry...

02:17:53.500 --> 02:17:57.599
...would you like to see
your mother and father again?

02:17:57.600 --> 02:17:59.898
Together...

02:17:59.900 --> 02:18:02.799
...we can bring them back.

02:18:02.900 --> 02:18:07.900
All I ask is for something in return.

02:18:14.299 --> 02:18:17.700
That's it, Harry.

02:18:18.299 --> 02:18:22.398
There is no good and evil.

02:18:22.400 --> 02:18:25.599
There is only power...

02:18:25.600 --> 02:18:30.000
...and those too weak to seek it.

02:18:30.400 --> 02:18:35.799
Together, we'll do
extraordinary things.

02:18:35.900 --> 02:18:38.400
Just give me the Stone!

02:18:40.700 --> 02:18:42.099
You liar!

02:18:42.100 --> 02:18:44.600
Kill him!

02:19:07.799 --> 02:19:13.400
- What is this magic?
- Fool, get the Stone!

02:20:58.400 --> 02:21:01.200
Good afternoon, Harry.

02:21:03.000 --> 02:21:07.699
- Tokens from your admirers?
- Admirers?

02:21:07.700 --> 02:21:13.899
What happened down in the dungeons between
you and Professor Quirrell is a complete secret.

02:21:13.900 --> 02:21:19.000
So, naturally, the whole school knows.

02:21:21.100 --> 02:21:24.899
I see that your friend Ronald
has saved you the trouble...

02:21:24.900 --> 02:21:27.899
...of opening your Chocolate Frogs.

02:21:27.900 --> 02:21:31.199
Ron was here? ls he all right?
What about Hermione?

02:21:31.200 --> 02:21:36.400
Fine. They're both just fine.

02:21:36.600 --> 02:21:39.700
- What happened to the Stone?
- Relax, dear boy.

02:21:39.800 --> 02:21:42.899
The Stone has been destroyed.

02:21:42.900 --> 02:21:46.899
My friend Nicholas and I
have had a little chat...

02:21:46.900 --> 02:21:51.499
...and agreed it was best all around.

02:21:51.500 --> 02:21:55.600
But then, Flamel,
he'll die, won't he?

02:21:57.300 --> 02:22:02.999
He has enough Elixir
to set his affairs in order.

02:22:03.000 --> 02:22:06.499
But yes, he will die.

02:22:06.500 --> 02:22:09.099
How is it I got the Stone, sir?

02:22:09.100 --> 02:22:11.899
One minute I was staring
in the mirror and the next...

02:22:11.900 --> 02:22:16.299
You see, only a person...

02:22:16.300 --> 02:22:20.399
...who wanted to find the Stone,
find it...

02:22:20.400 --> 02:22:25.300
...but not use it,
would be able to get it.

02:22:25.900 --> 02:22:29.699
That is one of my more brilliant ideas.

02:22:29.700 --> 02:22:35.000
And between you and me,
that is saying something.

02:22:36.100 --> 02:22:41.599
Does that mean, with the Stone gone that is,
that Voldemort can never come back?

02:22:41.600 --> 02:22:44.200
I'm afraid...

02:22:45.300 --> 02:22:49.700
...there are ways
in which he can return.

02:22:50.100 --> 02:22:52.899
Harry, do you know why...

02:22:52.900 --> 02:22:57.099
...Professor Quirrell couldn't bear
to have you touch him?

02:22:57.100 --> 02:23:02.000
It was because of your mother.
She sacrificed herself for you.

02:23:02.300 --> 02:23:05.699
And that kind of act leaves a mark.

02:23:05.700 --> 02:23:09.699
No, this kind of mark cannot be seen.

02:23:09.700 --> 02:23:14.900
- It lives in your very skin.
- What is it?

02:23:15.500 --> 02:23:19.500
Love, Harry. Love.

02:23:27.300 --> 02:23:31.599
Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans.

02:23:31.600 --> 02:23:36.499
I was most unfortunate in my youth
to come across a vomit-flavored one.

02:23:36.500 --> 02:23:39.999
And since then, I'm afraid,
I've lost my liking for them.

02:23:40.000 --> 02:23:43.599
But I think I could be safe...

02:23:43.600 --> 02:23:46.300
...with a nice toffee.

02:23:50.100 --> 02:23:51.900
Alas!

02:23:52.300 --> 02:23:54.700
Earwax.

02:24:09.700 --> 02:24:13.100
- All right there, Ron?
- All right. You?

02:24:13.900 --> 02:24:17.000
All right. Hermione?

02:24:17.300 --> 02:24:19.500
Never better.

02:24:35.000 --> 02:24:37.700
Another year gone.

02:24:38.200 --> 02:24:42.899
And now, as I understand it,
the house cup needs awarding.

02:24:42.900 --> 02:24:45.799
And the points stand thus:

02:24:45.800 --> 02:24:51.900
ln fourth place,
Gryffindor with 312 points.

02:24:53.500 --> 02:24:59.500
Third place,
Hufflepuff with 352 points.

02:25:04.500 --> 02:25:06.499
In second place...

02:25:06.500 --> 02:25:11.600
...Ravenclaw with 426 points.

02:25:17.000 --> 02:25:18.999
And in first place...

02:25:19.000 --> 02:25:24.800
...with 472 points, Slytherin house.

02:25:30.000 --> 02:25:32.600
Nice one, mate.

02:25:36.100 --> 02:25:40.199
Yes, yes, well done, Slytherin.
Well done, Slytherin.

02:25:40.200 --> 02:25:44.899
However, recent events must
be taken into account.

02:25:44.900 --> 02:25:50.200
And I have a few last-minute points
to award.

02:25:50.500 --> 02:25:56.199
To Miss Hermione Granger,
for the cool use of intellect...

02:25:56.200 --> 02:25:59.300
...while others were in grave peril...

02:25:59.700 --> 02:26:02.300
...50 points.

02:26:02.900 --> 02:26:04.500
Good job.

02:26:11.900 --> 02:26:18.200
Second, to Mr. Ronald Weasley,
for the best-played game of chess...

02:26:18.500 --> 02:26:24.000
...that Hogwarts has seen
these many years, 50 points.

02:26:28.300 --> 02:26:30.700
And third...

02:26:30.900 --> 02:26:33.999
...to Mr. Harry Potter...

02:26:34.000 --> 02:26:38.600
...for pure nerve
and outstanding courage...

02:26:38.900 --> 02:26:44.100
...l award Gryffindor house 60 points.

02:26:52.100 --> 02:26:54.199
We're tied with Slytherin!

02:26:54.200 --> 02:27:00.399
Finally, it takes a great deal of bravery
to stand up to your enemies...

02:27:00.400 --> 02:27:04.499
...but a great deal more
to stand up to your friends.

02:27:04.500 --> 02:27:07.699
I award 10 points...

02:27:07.700 --> 02:27:11.200
...to Neville Longbottom.

02:27:24.200 --> 02:27:27.899
Assuming that my calculations
are correct I believe...

02:27:27.900 --> 02:27:32.700
...that a change
of decoration is in order.

02:27:37.500 --> 02:27:41.100
Gryffindor wins the house cup.

02:28:18.900 --> 02:28:22.399
Come on, now.
Hurry up, you'll be late.

02:28:22.400 --> 02:28:27.000
Train's leaving. Go on.
Come on, hurry up.

02:28:32.100 --> 02:28:35.700
- Come on, Harry.
- One minute.

02:28:41.700 --> 02:28:45.700
Thought you were leaving
without saying goodbye, did you?

02:28:48.700 --> 02:28:50.800
This is for you.

02:29:07.300 --> 02:29:09.700
Thanks, Hagrid.

02:29:15.200 --> 02:29:19.900
Go on. On with you. On with you now.
Oh, listen, Harry.

02:29:20.100 --> 02:29:24.799
If that dolt of a cousin of yours,
Dudley, gives you any grief...

02:29:24.800 --> 02:29:27.699
...you could always threaten him...

02:29:27.700 --> 02:29:30.699
...with a nice pair of ears
to go with that tail of his.

02:29:30.700 --> 02:29:36.100
But Hagrid, we're not allowed to do magic
away from Hogwarts. You know that.

02:29:36.300 --> 02:29:40.900
I do. But your cousin don't, do he?

02:29:46.100 --> 02:29:49.499
Feels strange to be going home,
doesn't it?

02:29:49.500 --> 02:29:51.699
I'm not going home.

02:29:51.700 --> 02:29:54.000
Not really.
