WEBVTT

00:07.666 --> 00:09.666
NETFLIX PRESENTS

00:25.458 --> 00:27.166
Are we walking
across the projects?

00:27.250 --> 00:28.666
The buildings are connected.

00:28.750 --> 00:30.916
We came in through
the <i>Rose des Vents</i> side,

00:31.875 --> 00:34.000
now we're headed
through Lily of the Valley.

00:35.166 --> 00:37.833
How's that gonna help us?
We ain't gonna find any lilies here.

00:37.916 --> 00:40.375
Trust me, okay?
I'm point one percent Cherokee.

00:44.333 --> 00:45.458
It's that way.

00:46.125 --> 00:47.166
I was a Boy Scout too.

00:47.916 --> 00:50.583
<i>Delta One to base.</i>
<i>Delta One to base.</i>

00:50.666 --> 00:51.958
<i>We need your position, guys.</i>

00:52.666 --> 00:54.916
We're in a corridor
that leads to other corridors.

00:55.000 --> 00:56.333
Ousmane, where are we?

00:56.916 --> 00:58.875
We went right, left, blue door,

00:58.958 --> 01:00.541
so we go right…

01:01.166 --> 01:02.875
Right. Green door.

01:02.958 --> 01:03.833
-This way.
-Green.

01:11.750 --> 01:13.791
Ready to arrest
the most wanted man in Europe?

01:13.875 --> 01:14.708
Uh-uh.

01:15.875 --> 01:16.791
That was rhetorical.

01:16.875 --> 01:18.750
Whoo!

01:29.708 --> 01:30.875
Get up!

01:31.458 --> 01:32.958
-Is Diaz down there?
-Yeah.

01:33.041 --> 01:36.583
-Shall we call for backup?
-No. Not until we spot him.

01:48.500 --> 01:51.500
He's the shrimp, see?
Like an unhot Timothée Chalamet.

01:51.583 --> 01:53.875
He just showed up again after three years.

02:08.333 --> 02:10.000
Where you at, little shrimp?

02:10.666 --> 02:11.833
Where are you hiding?

02:13.333 --> 02:14.750
How we feelin'?

02:16.375 --> 02:18.041
I said, how are we feelin'?

02:18.666 --> 02:20.041
The monster…

02:20.958 --> 02:23.750
Jordan Diaz!

02:24.375 --> 02:27.041
I can't hear you! Make some noise!

02:27.125 --> 02:28.625
Damn, the shrimp bulked up.

02:28.708 --> 02:30.791
Yaaah!

02:30.875 --> 02:34.541
-How old is that photo?
-Three years. Must be the hair.

02:34.625 --> 02:37.291
-Hair changes everything.
-This guy's got…

02:37.375 --> 02:39.541
You still don't wanna call for backup?

02:39.625 --> 02:40.916
I said, yeah!

02:41.833 --> 02:43.083
Five win--

02:43.166 --> 02:44.708
-Can you hear me?
-Oh shit.

02:44.791 --> 02:48.333
Make as much noise as you can
for my man Diaz!

02:48.416 --> 02:49.958
The man of the hour! Give it up!

02:50.041 --> 02:51.875
Give it up for that fight!

02:51.958 --> 02:53.958
Everybody havin' a good time?

02:54.041 --> 02:57.083
Great. Now go home.
We're takin' the champ to the precinct.

03:00.625 --> 03:03.041
Cops are surrounding the building.
Let's just play nice.

03:05.625 --> 03:07.541
Easy, Jordan.
All right, everyone get outta here.

03:10.458 --> 03:11.291
Aah!

03:11.375 --> 03:13.375
You think you're tough?
Let's see what you got.

03:20.500 --> 03:23.000
Oh, you wanna go? Let's go.

03:25.875 --> 03:26.916
Here.

03:37.291 --> 03:39.041
-I was wrong. Call for backup!
-Let's go!

03:39.125 --> 03:40.375
Call for backup!

03:40.458 --> 03:43.000
-Huh?
-Call…

03:43.625 --> 03:44.625
…for backup…

03:45.875 --> 03:48.833
All right, guys. This is it.
Come on, move, move, move!

03:51.208 --> 03:52.625
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

04:05.041 --> 04:06.541
Come on, come on, come on! Go, go, go!

04:14.416 --> 04:16.041
-Okay, so…
-Right…

04:16.125 --> 04:18.166
-Go right--
-No, the blue one.

04:19.083 --> 04:20.666
Are you sure that's blue?

04:20.750 --> 04:22.208
It looks more chartreuse.

04:31.500 --> 04:32.833
Let's go, Ousmane!

04:42.583 --> 04:44.083
Get him!

04:50.375 --> 04:51.208
Police!

04:52.083 --> 04:54.541
Police, hands up!
Don't move! What is that?

04:54.625 --> 04:55.833
-Garbage?
-Drop it!

04:56.916 --> 04:58.333
Plastics go in that bin!

05:00.041 --> 05:01.833
I swear to God, I recycle!

05:01.916 --> 05:04.166
-It ain't him.
-To the rear. To the rear!

05:04.250 --> 05:06.416
Damn, the garbage police don't play!

05:26.125 --> 05:27.833
Police!

05:27.916 --> 05:30.291
Go, go, go! Nobody move!

05:30.875 --> 05:32.208
Don't move! Hands up!

05:33.416 --> 05:35.208
Police!

05:35.291 --> 05:37.375
Nobody move! Nobody move!

05:38.125 --> 05:40.875
-You're not gettin' out of this, dude.
-Get off me!

05:40.958 --> 05:42.833
-No way. All right?
-Don't move!

05:42.916 --> 05:46.833
Take care of him. Come here! Get him.
Hey. You with the megaphone.

05:46.916 --> 05:49.375
Come here. Tell us who won tonight.

05:49.458 --> 05:52.000
-And tonight's winner is…
-The police!

05:52.083 --> 05:54.666
The police.

05:54.750 --> 05:56.916
No, no, no. And tonight's winner is…

05:57.000 --> 05:58.958
-The winner is…
-The police!

05:59.041 --> 06:02.208
-The police!
-The police! The police!

06:02.291 --> 06:04.958
The police! The police! The police!

06:05.041 --> 06:08.625
The police! The police!
The police! The police!

06:08.708 --> 06:13.875
The police! The police! The police!
The police! The police! The police…

06:18.458 --> 06:19.666
Okay, Captain Monge.

06:19.750 --> 06:23.583
So, you're currently deputy chief
at the 12th District Judicial Police.

06:23.666 --> 06:25.250
-Do I have that--
-I mean, deputy?

06:25.833 --> 06:27.125
You're not a deputy?

06:27.208 --> 06:29.458
-I'm more like an associate chief.
-You're a deputy.

06:30.375 --> 06:31.291
Sure.

06:31.375 --> 06:33.791
You took the police chief's exam
three times.

06:33.875 --> 06:36.541
-You failed.
-I don't really think of them as failures.

06:36.625 --> 06:39.666
Five transfer requests
to the Criminal Division, Antiterrorism,

06:39.750 --> 06:41.333
personal security detail…

06:41.416 --> 06:42.875
-All dead ends.
-Hmm.

06:42.958 --> 06:44.000
Anything to add to that?

06:44.666 --> 06:46.458
Well, to quote Amin Maalouf,

06:46.541 --> 06:49.916
"Love lives on patience
as much as desire."

06:50.000 --> 06:50.833
Nice, right?

06:52.083 --> 06:54.541
-You know Amin Maalouf?
-I'm talking about your career.

06:54.625 --> 06:56.708
-Okay.
-Do you know why you're here today?

06:57.291 --> 06:58.916
-No.
-Are you sure about that?

06:59.000 --> 07:00.625
Repeating yourself won't change the truth.

07:00.708 --> 07:03.750
-And what do you think the truth is?
-I don't know. Why don't you tell me?

07:03.833 --> 07:06.291
-No. This isn't an interrogation.
-Are you sure?

07:06.375 --> 07:09.166
-I could invoke the Fifth Amendment.
-This isn't the US.

07:09.250 --> 07:12.375
Pleading the Fifth to your therapist
is a little counterproductive.

07:14.875 --> 07:16.916
Mmm. Do I know her?

07:18.125 --> 07:19.958
-Work or pleasure?
-Work.

07:20.041 --> 07:21.916
Well, that narrows it down.

07:22.000 --> 07:23.291
No, not familiar, no.

07:23.375 --> 07:26.583
-Clarissa Malbec. Arrested for burglaries.
-Right. Clarissa, yeah.

07:26.666 --> 07:28.333
She was quite the clever one.

07:28.916 --> 07:31.541
During her interrogation,
you allegedly said to her,

07:31.625 --> 07:34.291
"If you snitch on your partner,
I'll take you to the Tour d'Argent."

07:34.375 --> 07:35.583
"The duck is to die for."

07:36.208 --> 07:39.125
-Could be. It's possible.
-And you don't find that strange?

07:39.208 --> 07:41.125
No. Why? Are you vegetarian?

07:41.791 --> 07:43.875
Your colleagues think you're a liability.

07:43.958 --> 07:47.291
They think you might have
a severe superiority complex.

07:47.375 --> 07:49.958
Oh, no. I have absolutely no complexes.

07:51.000 --> 07:53.125
Do you really think that dinner with you

07:53.208 --> 07:55.750
could possibly be more tempting
than a plea bargain?

07:55.833 --> 07:58.125
Now you're the one getting philosophical.

07:58.208 --> 08:01.500
I wouldn't mind exploring this with you
over a nice dinner.

08:01.583 --> 08:03.208
I'll even let you choose the place.

08:04.250 --> 08:05.541
All right. Um…

08:05.625 --> 08:08.375
-I think I've heard all I need to hear.
-Mmm.

08:08.458 --> 08:10.958
-So, thank you.
-Oh, you can thank me later.

08:11.875 --> 08:12.750
What do you mean?

08:19.500 --> 08:21.250
Aaah! Don't do that.

08:21.333 --> 08:22.166
Careful.

08:22.916 --> 08:24.041
It's cashmere.

08:24.125 --> 08:26.125
-Oh, okay…
-Yeah, sorry.

08:27.708 --> 08:29.083
Oh, yeah.

08:31.000 --> 08:32.375
Up there.

08:40.625 --> 08:42.708
It's crazy how much
you look like your dad.

08:43.875 --> 08:46.166
-Yeah, it's the nose. The family nose.
-Mm-hm.

08:46.250 --> 08:47.958
You mind making love
in your parents' room?

08:48.041 --> 08:49.166
Why would I?

08:49.666 --> 08:51.041
Very Freudian of you.

08:51.666 --> 08:52.625
They're never here.

08:53.625 --> 08:54.708
I don't have to pay rent.

08:54.791 --> 08:57.375
And I'm considerate.
I always change the sheets.

08:57.458 --> 08:59.291
Hmm. Could you put some music on?
This is weird.

08:59.375 --> 09:02.208
Do you know why Enzo Ferrari
didn't want a radio in his car?

09:02.291 --> 09:04.916
-I don't.
-He wanted to hear the engine purring.

09:07.458 --> 09:08.541
Huh.

09:10.083 --> 09:11.916
Are you always this meticulous
about everything?

09:12.000 --> 09:13.083
No.

09:16.500 --> 09:19.833
Oh. We both agree
ripping off clothes is sexy, right?

09:19.916 --> 09:21.291
-Uh, yeah.
-You consent?

09:21.375 --> 09:23.708
-Of course.
-I haven't manipulated you?

09:23.791 --> 09:26.166
-No, no manipulation.
-This isn't a <i>quid pro quo</i> deal?

09:26.250 --> 09:27.708
-For real?
-I know.

09:27.791 --> 09:29.750
-But you can't do anything these days.
-Shut up.

09:38.875 --> 09:39.916
You're leaving?

09:40.500 --> 09:44.041
I have some smoked salmon.
Wild-caught, hand-sliced. Champagne.

09:44.125 --> 09:45.791
Sounds nice, but I should go.

09:46.291 --> 09:48.125
Goodbye. And thanks.

09:48.208 --> 09:49.958
You're welcome. Thank you.

09:50.041 --> 09:52.208
My phone number's probably in my file, hm?

09:52.291 --> 09:53.833
-Call me if you want.
-Oh, please.

09:54.750 --> 09:56.166
I'm glad you're okay with this.

09:56.250 --> 09:58.500
People are too quick
to dismiss all men as bastards.

09:58.583 --> 09:59.750
People overthink things.

09:59.833 --> 10:01.166
-I'm fine with this.
-Hm.

10:01.250 --> 10:04.041
You hit a piece of ass for narcissistic
pleasure. What's the problem?

10:04.125 --> 10:06.291
For the record,
you're more than a piece of ass.

10:06.375 --> 10:07.458
Wasn't talking about me.

10:08.083 --> 10:09.625
-Ah.
-All right. Bye.

10:12.375 --> 10:13.958
See you.

10:15.583 --> 10:18.291
-So, Diakité.
-The fight. Let me explain--

10:18.375 --> 10:19.791
-No need.
-Actually--

10:22.333 --> 10:23.541
Yeah, I know. I get it.

10:24.041 --> 10:27.166
That's just a snippet out of context.
It's tough to understand.

10:27.250 --> 10:29.708
You really have to see the first part.
At the beginning…

10:30.416 --> 10:33.291
No. That's not far back enough.
Go just a little before that.

10:34.625 --> 10:36.291
That's too far back. There's one part--

10:36.375 --> 10:37.875
-Shall I continue?
-No, it's all good.

10:37.958 --> 10:39.500
Over 500,000 views.

10:39.583 --> 10:42.125
You're unmanageable and obsessive,
and you've gone…

10:42.208 --> 10:43.250
viral.

10:43.791 --> 10:46.833
They're talking about you at the ministry.
Know what they're saying?

10:48.208 --> 10:50.083
That you're made to be in the limelight.

10:50.625 --> 10:52.916
I'm sure you're aware
we're in the midst of a PR crisis,

10:53.000 --> 10:54.875
especially with a certain
part of the population.

10:54.958 --> 10:57.875
Hey, I've always said that.
The problem is our image.

10:57.958 --> 11:00.333
Then again, I'm just a cop.
I'm not the police.

11:00.416 --> 11:02.250
Exactly right.
And we're gonna change that.

11:02.333 --> 11:04.958
You're going to become
the face of the national police force.

11:05.041 --> 11:06.041
Méaux?

11:07.166 --> 11:09.500
-Hi.
-Allow me to present Benoît Méaux.

11:09.583 --> 11:11.541
He's our communications director.

11:12.583 --> 11:15.458
So what we want
for our next campaign is a hero.

11:15.541 --> 11:19.208
An accessible, normal man
with incredible skills and prowess.

11:19.291 --> 11:21.083
A policeman 2.0,

11:21.166 --> 11:23.375
represented by someone relatable

11:23.458 --> 11:27.083
who happens to also have
a pre-existing fanbase online.

11:27.166 --> 11:28.000
You.

11:28.083 --> 11:29.000
Me?

11:29.083 --> 11:33.083
This means we need to create
a digital ecosystem using your image.

11:33.166 --> 11:36.791
That means YouTube, Facebook,
Insta, Snapchat and, of course, TikTok,

11:36.875 --> 11:40.583
so that people can follow your daily life
like you're their friend.

11:41.166 --> 11:45.125
And to top it all off,
a publicity spot for all platforms.

11:46.333 --> 11:47.458
LIBERTY, EQUALITY, FRATERNITY

11:47.541 --> 11:49.791
<i>A message</i>
<i>from the Interior Ministry.</i>

11:49.875 --> 11:51.666
<i>Stop! Thief! Thief!</i>

11:52.500 --> 11:53.333

11:54.291 --> 11:56.583

12:16.333 --> 12:17.625
So…

12:18.125 --> 12:19.958
What did you think of that?

12:20.541 --> 12:21.791
-Wait, is he for real?
-Very.

12:21.875 --> 12:23.041
Hang on a second.

12:23.125 --> 12:25.041
I'm unmanageable and obsessive.

12:25.125 --> 12:26.833
You said so. Why would you choose me?

12:26.916 --> 12:27.791
People like rebels.

12:28.375 --> 12:29.708
-Plus, you're a great father.
-Mmm.

12:29.791 --> 12:31.291
You're likable.

12:31.375 --> 12:33.375
Aah! There we are!

12:33.916 --> 12:35.541
I think I understand.

12:35.625 --> 12:37.333
Okay. How am I likable?

12:37.416 --> 12:39.208
-Uh…
-Mmm… mmm?

12:39.291 --> 12:40.541
-Méaux?
-Go ahead. Go on.

12:40.625 --> 12:41.875
Umm…

12:41.958 --> 12:43.291
-You're cool?
-No.

12:44.000 --> 12:46.250
-Uh, you…
-Need a hint? Look at this.

12:48.166 --> 12:50.291
-You're handsome?
-No. Look at it. Look at it.

12:50.375 --> 12:52.125
-You're likable, as in charming.
-Mm-hm.

12:52.208 --> 12:54.166
-You're cute. I don't--
-Another hint? B…

12:54.250 --> 12:55.625
-Buh?
-Buh. Buhh…

12:55.708 --> 12:57.000
-Buh. Buh. Buh…
-Buh?

12:57.083 --> 12:58.541
-Bluh…
-Bluh? Buh?

12:58.625 --> 12:59.583
Bluhhh…

12:59.666 --> 13:00.833
-Black?
-Oh, no.

13:00.916 --> 13:02.750
-Right? I'm a likable Black guy. That it?
-Oh!

13:02.833 --> 13:04.541
-Stop it. That's an order.
-No.

13:04.625 --> 13:07.416
I'm not gonna play the nice Black cop
to cover up the force's mistakes.

13:07.500 --> 13:10.541
Don't be so dramatic.
We're just asking you to be yourself.

13:10.625 --> 13:14.458
A symbol of the successful integration
of minorities into our institution.

13:15.041 --> 13:16.708
Know where you can stick your symbol?

13:23.291 --> 13:25.250
Hey, how'd it go?

13:25.333 --> 13:28.833
Great. Went well. Sounds like
you've been talking behind my back, hm?

13:28.916 --> 13:30.791
So now I'm a liability to investigations?

13:30.875 --> 13:33.833
If you have something to say,
go ahead. Who wants to start?

13:33.916 --> 13:34.750
No one? No? Hm?

13:34.833 --> 13:36.291
Look, you're just…

13:36.833 --> 13:37.833
sort of a loudmouth.

13:37.916 --> 13:39.166
A loudmouth?

13:39.750 --> 13:41.125
-Meaning?
-You brag a lot.

13:41.750 --> 13:43.333
-You're kind of a perv.
-A perv?

13:43.416 --> 13:45.750
-Sorry for being hands-on.
-You never listen to anything--

13:45.833 --> 13:47.458
-What?
-You always have to talk.

13:47.541 --> 13:50.208
-You're always checking me out.
-No. I don't check you out. No.

13:50.291 --> 13:52.166
-You wish.
-You're a dick, François.

13:52.250 --> 13:54.583
The truth hurts, but you are.
You're sexist, not funny.

13:54.666 --> 13:55.833
And you're full of yourself.

13:55.916 --> 13:57.166
-Full of myself?
-Yeah!

13:57.250 --> 13:58.708
And your cologne sucks.

13:59.416 --> 14:02.708
-It's a fragrance, and it's CK One.
-It smells like the back seat of an Uber.

14:03.291 --> 14:06.208
Newsflash. You're too old for
that hipster beard and metrosexual pants.

14:06.291 --> 14:08.208
-You're too tall.
-Metrosexual?

14:08.291 --> 14:09.875
They're slim fit. Excuse me for trying.

14:09.958 --> 14:12.958
Just 'cause we're cops, doesn't mean we
have to get clothes from a dumpster.

14:14.583 --> 14:16.333
Oh shit.

14:17.166 --> 14:18.166
Oh, you got me.

14:18.666 --> 14:20.750
-Uh…
-You guys are really good.

14:20.833 --> 14:23.458
You guys are really good.
You almost had me.

14:23.541 --> 14:25.208
-I almost bought it…
-You serious?

14:25.291 --> 14:27.416
Khadija made a joke about Ubers,
I thought, "Oh!"

14:27.500 --> 14:29.291
Oh! You all deserve Oscars.

14:29.375 --> 14:31.708
Keep it classy, De Niro!

14:31.791 --> 14:33.166
Come on, get to work.

14:34.833 --> 14:36.750
That was dumb.

14:36.833 --> 14:38.833
Does he really think
we're joking?

14:38.958 --> 14:40.083
Full of myself…

14:40.166 --> 14:41.708
I just don't like him.

14:54.708 --> 14:55.541
Yves?

14:56.750 --> 14:59.416
Just came to drop off some groceries.
Can you give me a hand?

15:01.083 --> 15:02.250
Babe, are you crying?

15:02.333 --> 15:04.083
-Are you okay?
-Wait, wait…

15:06.333 --> 15:07.291
Oh man.

15:10.875 --> 15:12.833
-Hello.
-Hello.

15:12.916 --> 15:15.125
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye. Yeah, bye.

15:15.750 --> 15:17.208
Take it easy.

15:17.291 --> 15:20.708
What's the deal, Dad? I thought you were
going to work after the store?

15:20.791 --> 15:22.625
Yeah, that's right. But, um…

15:23.208 --> 15:26.458
-I got frozen food I need to put away.
-Did you get my Monster Crunch?

15:28.333 --> 15:31.208
-Yves? Care to explain?
-Nothin' to explain, Pop.

15:31.291 --> 15:33.666
-At least someone's makin' love here.
-What'd you say?

15:34.416 --> 15:37.166
At least someone's gettin' laid
in this apartment.

15:37.250 --> 15:38.750
You better watch how you speak to me.

15:38.833 --> 15:41.208
Yves. I'm not one of your buddies.

15:41.708 --> 15:44.333
-You're right. I'm sorry. My bad.
-Okay, then.

15:59.083 --> 16:00.083
Ah!

16:00.625 --> 16:02.500
-Aah!
-How are you?

16:02.583 --> 16:04.083
Sorry, there was traffic.

16:04.166 --> 16:06.291
You shouldn't have bothered.
I booked a taxi.

16:06.375 --> 16:08.708
-I said I'd come pick you up.
-That's what I said.

16:08.791 --> 16:11.541
I was hoping he'd have something better
to do in the middle of the day.

16:11.625 --> 16:13.958
-I'm happy to do it.
-Are you available tomorrow night?

16:14.041 --> 16:14.875
For?

16:14.958 --> 16:16.791
You know!
It's Didier's wife's birthday.

16:16.875 --> 16:18.958
At the Ministry.
There'll be important people.

16:19.041 --> 16:20.583
-Daddy can introduce you.
-I'm not ten.

16:20.666 --> 16:23.291
-I can make friends on my own.
-Leave him alone. He's fine.

16:23.375 --> 16:26.250
Out of the way, kids!
Excuse me! Excuse--

16:30.791 --> 16:32.291
Oh my God. Is that an arm?

16:32.375 --> 16:35.250
Move over. Police.
Move. Move. Police.

16:43.000 --> 16:45.375
-<i>Hey, Djimo.</i>
-Ous, we got somethin' at Lyon station.

16:45.458 --> 16:46.708
-Hurry up.
<i>-I'm on my way.</i>

16:51.000 --> 16:52.375
-Djimo!
-Hey.

16:52.458 --> 16:54.833
-What's up?
-12th District Police beat us here.

16:54.916 --> 16:55.750
Okay.

16:56.791 --> 16:59.375
-Keep going. Pretend I'm not here.
-Yeah, sure thing.

17:01.625 --> 17:03.416
Wait. Excuse me. I'm actually with them.

17:05.708 --> 17:07.291
You see that guy with the cellphone?

17:07.375 --> 17:09.750
He just tried to sell me molly.
Have a nice day.

17:10.500 --> 17:13.041
-Step over this way, sir.
-Uh-- Look, I'm with him.

17:13.125 --> 17:14.541
-I'm police.
-Sure.

17:14.625 --> 17:15.958
-IT department.
-Spread your legs.

17:16.041 --> 17:17.458
-You didn't hear?
-No!

17:17.541 --> 17:20.166
-Passengers alerted me about a loud noise.
-Hang on.

17:20.250 --> 17:22.291
-At which point on the journey…
-Hang on.

17:23.666 --> 17:25.166
All right, young man, that's enough.

17:25.250 --> 17:27.208
-I'll take it from here.
-No, I'm police.

17:27.791 --> 17:29.083
-François Monge.
-Oh!

17:29.166 --> 17:31.333
-No! Ousmane, I can't believe it!
-Hey, man!

17:31.416 --> 17:32.791
-What are you doing here?
-You know…

17:33.541 --> 17:35.458
-Oh man! Been a while. Gosh.
-That's for sure.

17:36.041 --> 17:37.208
Oh, hello. How are you?

17:37.291 --> 17:39.041
-François.
-You two go back a ways?

17:39.125 --> 17:40.875
-Pfft…
-Oh, man, we were partners back in…

17:40.958 --> 17:42.291
-When was that…
-Oh, yeah, yeah.

17:42.375 --> 17:44.166
I wouldn't say
I boosted him up the ladder…

17:44.250 --> 17:46.500
No, no, I wouldn't say that. No.

17:47.875 --> 17:51.958
-Can you go talk to the witnesses?
-Yeah. Can I talk to you for a minute?

17:53.416 --> 17:54.833
-It's really good to see you.
-Yeah.

17:54.916 --> 17:56.666
-You look fantastic.
-I'm okay. Look at you!

17:56.750 --> 17:58.750
-Mmm.
-You look fit. You working out more?

17:58.833 --> 18:00.666
Yeah, you've… put on some weight.

18:00.750 --> 18:02.833
-Yeah.
-That's aging. I'm staying in shape.

18:02.916 --> 18:04.291
Don't know about that.

18:04.375 --> 18:06.875
-I think you look a little pudgy.
-Oh, yeah? Really?

18:06.958 --> 18:10.000
-Anything new with you?
-Pretty much same old, same old.

18:10.083 --> 18:12.666
-I'm captain of the Criminal Division now.
-Mmm?

18:12.750 --> 18:14.916
-I even have my own team. So, yeah.
-Yeah? Great.

18:15.000 --> 18:16.625
-Congratulations. That's great.
-Thanks.

18:16.708 --> 18:19.958
-Uh, and you?
-I'm still at the 12th. It's great.

18:20.625 --> 18:21.458
Glad to hear that.

18:21.541 --> 18:22.750
-Yeah, it's been good.
-Yeah?

18:22.833 --> 18:25.000
I wanted to return to fundamentals.

18:25.083 --> 18:27.166
Uh, back to basics.
It's been so enriching.

18:27.250 --> 18:28.291
Mmm.

18:31.000 --> 18:32.083
-Wanna tell me?
-What?

18:32.166 --> 18:33.958
-Whose wife you slept with?
-What do you mean?

18:34.041 --> 18:37.750
Uh, you expect me to believe you left
Criminal Division 'cause you felt like it?

18:37.833 --> 18:40.541
-Sounds punitive.
-I just told you it's been very enriching.

18:40.625 --> 18:42.625
-Oh, yeah?
-Not all of us are careerists.

18:42.708 --> 18:43.750
No, no. I understand.

18:43.833 --> 18:46.958
-Not all of us cut throats to get ahead.
-Ah, ah, ah!

18:47.041 --> 18:49.000
-No, wait. I'm not saying you.
-Yeah?

18:49.083 --> 18:50.791
-Right!
-Just, work's not everything.

18:50.875 --> 18:53.333
Is there a Mrs. Monge in your life
besides your mom?

18:53.416 --> 18:54.708
No, Hey, you know me.

18:54.791 --> 18:56.875
-No woman on Earth can tie me down.
-Right!

18:56.958 --> 18:58.375
-Well, she better hurry.
-Oh, yeah?

18:58.458 --> 19:00.208
Or there's gonna be a huge age difference.

19:00.291 --> 19:03.250
Yeah, well, I'm maturing.

19:03.333 --> 19:06.666
-I'm going from a hellcat to a lone wolf.
-Yeah, yeah. Not bad.

19:06.750 --> 19:08.708
-How about you?
-I'm the same way.

19:08.791 --> 19:11.125
-Good on my own. Chillin'.
-Oh, yeah?

19:12.250 --> 19:13.291
That's just great.

19:14.958 --> 19:17.750
-So, uh… where's the medical examiner?
-Uh…

19:17.833 --> 19:20.750
The new guy was here, but he saw the body,
got squeamish and took off.

19:20.833 --> 19:23.041
-Is it that bad?
-Let's have a look.

19:30.375 --> 19:31.458
Hmm.

19:32.333 --> 19:35.208
No identification. Cause of death unknown.

19:35.291 --> 19:37.625
-And the other half?
-This is the half we found.

19:38.625 --> 19:40.916
-Um…
-We'll let you finish up. Thanks a lot.

19:41.708 --> 19:44.291
-Let's catch up. It was great to see you.
-Yeah, it was.

19:44.375 --> 19:47.000
Could you show me around
the new Crime Division offices?

19:47.083 --> 19:49.791
-Oh, no, they're not… No, seriously--
-I heard they're awesome.

19:49.875 --> 19:51.541
-Great, we can ride together.
-But--

19:53.166 --> 19:54.541
Lot of space.

19:55.541 --> 19:58.000
But it's a little-- little cold,
don't you think?

19:58.708 --> 20:02.750
It just feels less personal
than a district station.

20:05.791 --> 20:09.416
Ousmane, the Saint-Julien-en-Genevois
station found a guy's legs

20:09.500 --> 20:11.083
on a train track outside Valergnes.

20:11.166 --> 20:12.333
His name was Kevin Marchal.

20:12.416 --> 20:15.000
-Oh, that's for me. I got it.
-Uh… Who's this?

20:15.083 --> 20:17.708
Sorry. Lieutenant Monge
from the 12th District.

20:17.791 --> 20:20.083
-Hi, everyone. At ease.
-Uh, hi.

20:20.166 --> 20:21.500
-He called in the body.
-Yeah.

20:21.583 --> 20:24.250
Guy probably got his heart broken
and just couldn't live any--

20:24.333 --> 20:27.750
-Wow. No. Two bullets in his thighs.
-Well, then it's a homicide. I call dibs!

20:30.291 --> 20:31.375
What?

20:33.833 --> 20:34.666
What is it?

20:36.041 --> 20:38.083
WHEN DUTY CALLS

20:40.125 --> 20:41.750
I'll tell the DA. Call Valergnes.

20:41.833 --> 20:43.750
-I'll be back three days tops.
-On it.

20:43.833 --> 20:46.458
Oh, this is great.
Just the kind of content we need.

20:46.541 --> 20:47.708
No, you're not coming.

20:47.791 --> 20:49.666
-Uh…
-It's too dangerous. Too risky.

20:49.750 --> 20:51.833
-Can't bring civilians. It's low-profile.
-But I have--

20:51.916 --> 20:53.625
I'm going undercover. Thanks, bye.

20:54.541 --> 20:57.000
-What just happened?
-That's my Ousmane!

20:57.083 --> 21:00.250
Intrepid! Bold!
Getting the old team back together.

21:00.333 --> 21:02.125
What team?

21:07.166 --> 21:09.750
Hey, wait, Ousmane.
This is my case. You can't do this to me.

21:09.833 --> 21:12.708
-Now's not the time.
-Actually, it is. I found the body.

21:12.791 --> 21:15.750
It's cut in two, so we each get a half.
I'm okay with that.

21:15.833 --> 21:16.791
François?

21:16.875 --> 21:19.208
You're district. I'm Criminal Division.

21:19.291 --> 21:21.750
How would we team up?
There's no protocol whatsoever.

21:21.833 --> 21:25.500
That's your excuse? All right.
You used to be more fun.

21:27.500 --> 21:30.708
-Oh, I see! Is this about Yasmine? Huh?
-About Yasmine?

21:30.791 --> 21:33.500
-Yeah, about the fling I had with her.
-You really think I care?

21:33.583 --> 21:35.000
You were crazy about her.

21:35.083 --> 21:36.750
Oh, come on. She's just a good friend.

21:36.833 --> 21:37.666
-Ousmane.
-What?

21:37.750 --> 21:39.041
-Dude!
-What? Come on.

21:39.125 --> 21:41.500
Back then, it was enough
to make you totally ghost me.

21:41.583 --> 21:43.291
-You're kidding. I ghosted you?
-Come on!

21:43.375 --> 21:45.541
I left you all those voicemails
after the captain exam.

21:45.625 --> 21:46.791
You never called me back.

21:46.875 --> 21:49.791
If you could have seen yourself,
laughing at everything she said,

21:49.875 --> 21:51.458
too chickenshit to make a move.

21:52.333 --> 21:54.583
Yeah, sorry I decided
to take the initiative.

21:54.666 --> 21:57.916
You probably wish hittin' on girls
was part of the exam.

21:58.000 --> 21:59.500
You might have passed.

21:59.583 --> 22:01.333
-That was small of you.
-No, that's small.

22:01.416 --> 22:04.375
Hey, at least I didn't burn my tip
on the urinal cake.

22:04.458 --> 22:06.416
You're pissin' in Morse code, you weirdo.

22:06.500 --> 22:08.416
-Huh?
-See a doctor, drippy.

22:11.000 --> 22:12.583
-Wait, Ousmane--
-I'm not walking you out.

22:12.666 --> 22:13.625
Hey, wait!

22:14.166 --> 22:16.250
Shit! Uh…

22:17.958 --> 22:19.750
Ousmane! Oh shit…

22:20.250 --> 22:22.791
Come on. You can't deny
we had something real.

22:22.875 --> 22:25.041
Right? We were a good team, a unit, a duo.

22:25.125 --> 22:26.958
We were besties, pals, buddies.

22:27.041 --> 22:28.458
You got a thesaurus on you?

22:28.541 --> 22:29.791
Yeah, after that, we split up.

22:29.875 --> 22:31.166
-Your fault, my fault--
-My fault?

22:31.250 --> 22:34.125
That's not the problem.
You can't go to the provinces without me.

22:34.208 --> 22:36.666
You don't know 'em like I do.
You need someone you can count on.

22:36.750 --> 22:38.458
Oh, so now you know the provinces?

22:38.541 --> 22:40.708
I was born in Bordeaux. Studied in Rennes.

22:40.791 --> 22:43.416
My parents have a chalet in Lyon,
and my uncle's estate is near Aix.

22:43.500 --> 22:46.416
-Yeah, you could say that.
-François. Look at my mouth.

22:47.250 --> 22:49.250
Read my lips. You hear the words?

22:50.125 --> 22:51.333
I'm going. You're not.

23:01.375 --> 23:03.125
Smell that fresh air, huh? Huh?

23:03.208 --> 23:05.833
Look at those mountains,
all the vegetation.

23:05.916 --> 23:08.458
People go across the world
to Réunion Island,

23:08.541 --> 23:09.958
when everything we need's in France.

23:10.041 --> 23:10.875
Réunion <i>is</i> France.

23:10.958 --> 23:12.041
Yeah, sort of.

23:13.541 --> 23:14.875
Okay, how long are you gonna sulk?

23:14.958 --> 23:17.375
Three hours on the train
without a word is childish.

23:17.458 --> 23:21.125
-Childish? You called your daddy.
-Daddy? Give me a break.

23:21.208 --> 23:23.125
-I didn't call my daddy.
-Then who'd you call?

23:23.208 --> 23:24.666
-Mommy.
-Right.

23:24.750 --> 23:28.000
She's close with the chief of staff, so--
Anyway, listen. You played, you lost.

23:28.083 --> 23:29.875
-That's it. Move on.
-Nepotism.

23:30.500 --> 23:32.208
-Come again?
-Nepotism.

23:32.291 --> 23:33.916
Nepotism? How dare you say that?

23:34.000 --> 23:36.791
You don't know my life.
You don't know my parents, my journey.

23:36.875 --> 23:39.333
I'm not like you.
I don't have history on my side.

23:39.416 --> 23:41.041
Oh, keep going. This is gonna be good.

23:41.125 --> 23:43.500
Well, when you're white, educated,
and well-connected,

23:43.583 --> 23:45.250
it's not easy
to carve a place for yourself.

23:45.333 --> 23:47.833
-That right?
-Laugh it up. We don't have quotas, sir.

23:47.916 --> 23:49.708
Uh-huh. It's every man for himself.

23:49.791 --> 23:52.500
It's so much easier to be Black and poor,
that what you're saying?

23:53.541 --> 23:55.041
Hmph.

23:57.416 --> 23:58.458
Did I say that?

23:59.958 --> 24:01.750
Anyway, is someone picking us up?

24:01.833 --> 24:03.750
Alice Gauthier, Deputy Captain.

24:03.833 --> 24:04.750
Alice?

24:04.833 --> 24:06.416
-Yeah.
-There's a name from the '90s.

24:06.500 --> 24:08.125
-Okay?
-So she's 25, 30.

24:08.208 --> 24:09.958
Provincial girls are way less complicated.

24:10.041 --> 24:11.500
-Yeah, and?
-Well…

24:11.583 --> 24:13.833
Since you're a little rusty,
this could be your chance.

24:13.916 --> 24:15.333
-You serious?
-Well…

24:15.416 --> 24:16.916
I just don't think about it every day.

24:17.000 --> 24:18.916
You really have a problem.

24:19.000 --> 24:21.583
-You should see a therapist.
-I did. Yesterday. Quite fun.

24:22.708 --> 24:25.416
Well, Alice isn't winning points
for punctuality.

24:25.500 --> 24:28.625
Sorry, I was waiting for you over there.
I got you some coffee. I'm Alice.

24:28.708 --> 24:30.333
-Thanks.
-Alice Gauthier. Nice to meet you.

24:30.416 --> 24:31.416
-Pleasure.
-François Monge.

24:31.500 --> 24:34.125
-In Paris, we do two kisses.
-Oh, we don't do that here.

24:35.541 --> 24:37.666
Chief Diakité,
great to be working with you.

24:37.750 --> 24:40.083
-I've heard so much about you.
-Well, great. I have--

24:40.166 --> 24:41.666
I mean, likewise.

24:41.750 --> 24:43.666
-It's a pleasure to meet you too.
-Hmm!

24:43.750 --> 24:45.791
I'm excited already.

24:45.875 --> 24:48.208
-Shall we?
-Sure! Off to Wonderland, Alice.

24:49.750 --> 24:51.583
Just kidding!

24:51.666 --> 24:53.375
-Hmm.
-So, uh, you say something?

24:53.916 --> 24:56.166
-Nope.
-That's what I thought.

25:01.166 --> 25:03.250
-Are you from around here?
-Thonon-les-Bains.

25:03.333 --> 25:04.375
"As-thon-ishing."

25:09.666 --> 25:12.625
Is there any interesting architecture
around here?

25:15.250 --> 25:17.583
Looks like there's
some interesting businesses.

25:19.958 --> 25:23.208
All that's missing is "Napoleon's Bakery"
and "Joan of Arc's Tavern."

25:23.291 --> 25:24.666
BUTCHER - THE THOROUGHBRED

25:24.750 --> 25:26.791
It's a traditional,
patriotic town.

25:26.875 --> 25:27.958
This isn't patriotic.

25:29.250 --> 25:33.125
Let me explain. During the past few years,
there's been a lot of drug trafficking.

25:33.208 --> 25:34.458
People just want law and order.

25:34.541 --> 25:36.041
-They wanna preserve our values.
-Hm.

25:37.750 --> 25:41.000
-They just want someone with a firm hand.
-Someone like him?

25:43.000 --> 25:44.541
That fascist from the France Vive party?

25:44.625 --> 25:45.583
OUR CITY, OUR FIGHT

25:45.666 --> 25:48.375
He's on the right,
so you call him a fascist. Why not a Nazi?

25:48.458 --> 25:49.583
Tell me the difference.

25:49.666 --> 25:51.250
For your information,

25:51.333 --> 25:54.708
fascism implies a period in history,
dark and brutal, but not uninteresting…

25:54.791 --> 25:56.166
-Stop it.
-…in economic…

25:56.250 --> 25:59.416
This guy doesn't like Blacks,
Arabs, Jews, or gays.

25:59.500 --> 26:02.833
Europe, Me Too, rap, nothing.
What do you call that?

26:03.916 --> 26:04.958
A patriot.

26:12.375 --> 26:14.833
-Got you!
-Okay, good. That's good. Yeah.

26:17.333 --> 26:18.458
Where do we start?

26:23.458 --> 26:24.708
Oh, hello, there.

26:24.791 --> 26:27.958
I guess you found
his better half, didn't you?

26:29.583 --> 26:32.000
Kevin Marchal, 26, lived with his mother.

26:32.083 --> 26:33.791
Sentenced two years ago
for drug trafficking.

26:33.875 --> 26:35.500
He served eight months.
Nothing after that.

26:36.541 --> 26:38.166
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

26:38.250 --> 26:40.083
Yeah, I'm good. I'm fine.

26:41.125 --> 26:43.500
So he fell off a bridge,
and a train cut him in half?

26:43.583 --> 26:46.458
No, the body was bisected
using a sharp metal object.

26:46.541 --> 26:47.791
Ax? A chainsaw?

26:47.875 --> 26:50.125
No, we're leaning toward
a defective guard rail.

26:50.208 --> 26:53.666
However, that doesn't explain
why the wounds are cauterized like this.

26:53.750 --> 26:58.416
Oh, that's crazy. It's seared like bacon,
but it's crispy like barbecue.

26:58.500 --> 27:00.458
We need
the toxicology report.

27:00.541 --> 27:01.416
Wow.

27:01.500 --> 27:04.625
There are two gunshot wounds
from a distance of three and five meters.

27:04.708 --> 27:06.416
Oh, yeah, you can see the entrance wound.

27:08.541 --> 27:11.083
One bullet lodged in bone.

27:11.833 --> 27:13.958
-It's a 7.62.
-Oh, yeah.

27:14.041 --> 27:16.541
-Tokarev?
-The dealers' weapon of choice.

27:18.875 --> 27:20.500
What the hell are you doing?

27:20.583 --> 27:23.750
Well, sometimes, when addicts wanna
hide their handiwork--

27:23.833 --> 27:26.125
-That's right.
-Correct me if I'm wrong, doctor.

27:26.833 --> 27:27.875
There's nothing here.

27:29.000 --> 27:31.291
-Stop that!
-That's how I found it.

27:42.625 --> 27:44.083
-You all right?
-Huh? Yeah.

27:44.583 --> 27:46.625
-It's weird. So much space.
-Nice to see you.

27:46.708 --> 27:47.750
That's the country for you.

27:47.833 --> 27:48.958
-Hello.
-Good morning.

27:49.041 --> 27:50.000
-I'm fine.
-How are you?

27:50.083 --> 27:51.125
-Morning.
-Morning.

27:51.208 --> 27:53.958
Great crime scene. Perfectly marked.

27:54.041 --> 27:56.791
Protected. No interference.
It's neat, organized.

27:56.875 --> 27:58.791
Good work. No need to envy Paris cops.

27:58.875 --> 28:00.375
We don't envy you!

28:02.125 --> 28:04.083
-Hi. Thanks for meeting us here.
-Morning.

28:04.916 --> 28:06.666
-You wanna go talk to them?
-Why me?

28:06.750 --> 28:09.125
We can save time.
I'll debrief with the deputy captain.

28:09.208 --> 28:11.250
-Why not the other way around?
-Just because.

28:11.333 --> 28:12.750
"Just because" isn't good enough.

28:13.708 --> 28:16.833
Well, because I'm a chief,
and you're a captain. Got that?

28:16.916 --> 28:18.125
Hmm.

28:18.208 --> 28:20.583
-Is that an order?
-That's right. It's an order.

28:20.666 --> 28:22.750
-Oh.
-I can do that. I'm your superior.

28:22.833 --> 28:23.916
Hmm.

28:29.791 --> 28:31.333
-Gentlemen.
-Hey.

28:33.875 --> 28:36.916
Morning, guys. Captain Monge,
Paris Criminal Division.

28:37.000 --> 28:40.416
Well, Paris, but I'm originally
from the provinces. We're the same.

28:41.958 --> 28:46.375
Man, people talk about climate change,
but weather's fine here!

28:48.125 --> 28:50.916
-Do we have the motorcycle?
-Just his legs.

28:51.000 --> 28:52.791
Then tire tracks, blood and broken glass.

28:52.875 --> 28:54.708
-He hit the rail then fell on the train?
-Right.

28:54.791 --> 28:57.750
-And lost control of his bike there.
-We got a bullet hole here.

28:58.250 --> 28:59.958
-That's why he lost control.
-Mmm.

29:00.458 --> 29:01.583
This is where he was shot.

29:11.166 --> 29:12.916
Two 7.62 rounds.

29:21.708 --> 29:24.083
It fits the traces of blood
we found down the road.

29:33.958 --> 29:37.583
What's weird is that the guy chasing him
stopped right after he shot him.

29:38.083 --> 29:39.166
To finish the job.

29:46.875 --> 29:49.291
Or to cover his tracks.
The motorcycle.

29:53.083 --> 29:54.458
It's too heavy for one guy.

30:02.625 --> 30:04.000
He just forgot one detail.

30:06.416 --> 30:08.125
The 9:52 train to Paris.

30:12.041 --> 30:15.375
-It wasn't the guard rail.
-No. The high-voltage cables.

30:15.458 --> 30:17.458
That's where the burns came from.

30:18.291 --> 30:19.375
I'm coming up.

30:24.750 --> 30:26.625
-What?
-Nothing.

30:26.708 --> 30:27.583
What is it?

30:28.083 --> 30:29.125
Am I wrong?

30:29.208 --> 30:30.208
No, no, you're…

30:30.708 --> 30:31.541
great.

30:32.333 --> 30:33.166
What?

30:35.333 --> 30:36.458
I found a tooth.

30:36.541 --> 30:38.125
I found a tooth.

30:38.791 --> 30:41.208
-He must've lost it on impact.
-He wasn't missing one.

30:42.250 --> 30:43.625
-No?
-Mm-mm.

30:43.708 --> 30:44.958
Oh.

30:50.250 --> 30:52.291
Wait, is that the same stick
from the morgue?

30:53.583 --> 30:54.916
Mm-mm. No.

30:57.250 --> 30:58.166
No.

31:00.125 --> 31:01.875
How about we go get some paperwork done?

31:01.958 --> 31:04.458
-Thought we'd visit the victim's mother.
-Ugh! Ugh!

31:04.541 --> 31:07.916
-Can we get a car?
-I haven't told her her son's dead yet.

31:08.000 --> 31:09.541
We'll take care of it.

31:09.625 --> 31:12.333
Okay. Sylvain, can you get them a car?

31:12.416 --> 31:13.583
Ugh. Ugh.

31:14.166 --> 31:15.750
-Okay.
-Can I get your digits?

31:16.416 --> 31:17.916
What? My digits?

31:18.958 --> 31:21.500
-For work.
-You sure you don't need my fingerprints?

31:21.583 --> 31:23.000
Just the number's fine.

31:23.083 --> 31:25.250
-Okay, it's 06…
-Right.

31:25.333 --> 31:27.458
-…39, 98…
-Mm-hm.

31:27.541 --> 31:29.250
…32…

31:29.333 --> 31:30.541
…15.

31:30.625 --> 31:32.541
-Call me any time.
-Okay.

31:32.625 --> 31:33.875
Mine is 06…

31:33.958 --> 31:36.333
No, it's fine. You're always together, so…

31:37.000 --> 31:38.833
-Okay. See you.
-See you.

31:40.000 --> 31:42.083
Hmm.

31:45.666 --> 31:48.166
-Mmm. I don't like her.
-What?

31:48.250 --> 31:50.083
No, there' something's off about her.

31:50.166 --> 31:51.791
Because she digs me and not you?

31:51.875 --> 31:53.375
Is that it?

31:53.458 --> 31:54.625
Yeah, of course.

31:55.208 --> 31:57.166
-Here's the keys.
-Thanks, Sylvain. Appreciate it.

31:57.250 --> 31:59.250
Unreal.

31:59.333 --> 32:01.125
-You're jealous.
-Of what?

32:01.208 --> 32:02.958
-This.
-Jealous of what?

32:03.041 --> 32:04.791
-Of this.
-You wish.

32:05.958 --> 32:07.541
-No.
-So jealous.

32:07.625 --> 32:09.291
-Mm.
-What is it, then?

32:09.375 --> 32:10.750
-Well…
-Say it.

32:10.833 --> 32:12.750
-You don't have an excuse!
-I'm 37.

32:12.833 --> 32:15.333
I'm too old for this nonsense.

32:22.291 --> 32:24.541
-What are you doin'?
-Putting on my gun.

32:24.625 --> 32:27.791
No. You'll just scare her.
In the glove box.

32:28.500 --> 32:30.333
-This isn't protocol.
-Here.

32:31.458 --> 32:33.500
-It's fine.
-Yeah, but it's not protocol.

32:35.541 --> 32:37.333
Also, go easy with the news.

32:37.416 --> 32:39.166
Come on. I can be sensitive.

32:43.291 --> 32:46.250
Afternoon, ma'am. Captain Diakité,
Paris Criminal Division.

32:46.333 --> 32:49.083
-This is Lieutenant Monge.
-Also from the Criminal Division.

32:49.166 --> 32:50.500
No, you're not.

32:50.583 --> 32:52.416
But this way, we don't have to explain.

32:52.500 --> 32:55.500
-Sorry, what's this about?
-Can we come in for a minute?

32:56.416 --> 32:57.958
-Okay.
-Thank you.

32:59.000 --> 33:00.333
-What are you doing?
-What are you?

33:00.416 --> 33:01.625
-I'm goin' inside.
-So am I.

33:01.708 --> 33:03.041
-Come on, back up.
-Why me?

33:03.125 --> 33:04.166
-Because.
-Whatever.

33:04.250 --> 33:05.666
-Aww, thanks so much.
-Fine.

33:08.166 --> 33:09.791
Do you mind if I use
your restroom, please?

33:09.875 --> 33:11.958
-Yes. It's right there.
-Thank you.

33:12.041 --> 33:12.875
Oh…

33:13.458 --> 33:15.583
In the meantime,
we can chat in the living room.

33:18.666 --> 33:20.333
Oh…

33:20.416 --> 33:22.291
Come on.

33:22.375 --> 33:23.833
Have a seat.

33:23.916 --> 33:25.750
-Oh.
-Animals. Uh…

33:27.625 --> 33:29.333
Okay, um, Mrs. Marchal…

33:29.416 --> 33:32.166
-I have good news and bad news.
-You found my son, didn't you?

33:32.250 --> 33:34.791
-Well, yes. That's the good news.
-And he's okay?

33:36.958 --> 33:39.833
Well, okay, actually,
I shouldn't have started like that.

33:43.541 --> 33:44.875
-Um…
-Is he hurt?

33:44.958 --> 33:46.708
He was shot twice in the leg, but--

33:46.791 --> 33:48.208
Oh my God. Can he still walk?

33:48.291 --> 33:50.708
-No. He can't walk anymore.
-How did--

33:50.791 --> 33:52.583
-But there's a detail--
-Oh…

34:11.041 --> 34:14.416
-Please tell me he's all right.
-You're not helping, Mrs. Marchal.

34:14.500 --> 34:17.208
Okay, like a chest wax.
Just rip it off in one go.

34:18.500 --> 34:21.041
Um, Kevin is dead, ma'am. I'm sorry.

34:21.125 --> 34:22.583
-No.
-I'm sorry.

34:22.666 --> 34:25.291
No! No!

34:29.041 --> 34:30.750
-No!
-Sorry.

34:31.458 --> 34:32.833
No!

34:32.916 --> 34:33.875
-No! No!
-Yeah…

34:33.958 --> 34:34.833
-Please, no!
-Yes!

34:34.916 --> 34:37.000
-No! No!
-Sorry. I'm sorry.

34:37.083 --> 34:39.958
-Oh, no!
-Shh. Calm down. Ow!

34:40.541 --> 34:42.375
-Shh, it's okay.
-What the hell did you do?

34:42.458 --> 34:43.541
Get a paper bag.

34:43.625 --> 34:45.916
She's hyperventilating.
Breathe through your nose.

34:46.000 --> 34:48.458
Breathe. Shh!

34:51.000 --> 34:53.041
-No! No!
-What's that?

34:53.125 --> 34:54.333
Stupid!

34:57.541 --> 34:58.375
Gross.

34:58.458 --> 35:00.333
Shh. Deep breaths. Come on.

35:00.416 --> 35:02.458
Okay, do it. Just keep breathing. Here.

35:02.541 --> 35:03.916
Breathe into the bag.

35:04.000 --> 35:06.166
There you go.

35:06.250 --> 35:09.000
We'll do everything in our power
to find out who did this, okay?

35:10.583 --> 35:12.500
Oh, it smells just like him.

35:13.125 --> 35:15.375
Oh! He was a good boy,

35:15.458 --> 35:18.958
but he was always hanging out
with the wrong people.

35:19.041 --> 35:20.625
Quit it!

35:21.833 --> 35:22.791
Who, for instance?

35:23.916 --> 35:26.708
There was his… his friend, Nader.

35:26.791 --> 35:28.041
The Snitch.

35:28.125 --> 35:29.750
It'll be okay.

35:29.833 --> 35:31.250
No!

35:31.333 --> 35:33.541
It's okay, ma'am. We understand.

35:35.666 --> 35:37.166
What did Kevin do? Did he work?

35:38.625 --> 35:41.791
He used to work at the pharmacy,
but… but he got fired.

35:41.875 --> 35:43.791
They accused him of stealing medication

35:43.875 --> 35:47.416
and having people buy it from him
on the street.

35:48.750 --> 35:51.791
That's when he started
spending his days in his workshop.

35:51.875 --> 35:53.541
-That's what he called it.
-Mm-hm.

35:53.625 --> 35:55.750
-I don't know what he was doing, but…
-Let go.

35:55.833 --> 35:57.750
-At least he was here.
-Mm-hm.

35:57.833 --> 36:00.333
-With me.
-Okay.

36:01.333 --> 36:02.541
He was with me!

36:02.625 --> 36:04.458
-I know.
-Shh. It's okay.

36:05.541 --> 36:07.375
-It's okay.
-Let it out.

36:10.583 --> 36:11.583
I know.

36:12.208 --> 36:14.041
I know. Okay, okay, okay.

36:15.666 --> 36:17.500
-Ow! My pinkie.
-Shut up!

36:17.583 --> 36:18.708
Ow!

36:18.791 --> 36:20.041
There you go.

36:27.125 --> 36:28.916
This is nice, huh? Yeah.

36:32.958 --> 36:36.250
Okay, well, it's slippery.
Pig and chicken shit.

36:39.291 --> 36:40.625
Hey!

36:43.250 --> 36:44.333
It's back there.

36:44.416 --> 36:46.958
Careful around the dogs.
They can be a little frisky.

36:49.041 --> 36:50.791
Take a hike!

36:51.708 --> 36:53.166
Hey. Sh!

36:53.875 --> 36:55.791
Man, I don't think
I ever got a rabies shot.

36:55.875 --> 36:57.541
Come on! Look at the little guys.

37:00.958 --> 37:04.125
See, they're fine. For real. Right?

37:04.708 --> 37:06.041
Huh? Look.

37:06.125 --> 37:07.458
What a good boy.

37:07.541 --> 37:09.000
Oh shit!

37:10.083 --> 37:11.541
They're out of control!

37:19.458 --> 37:21.916
What the hell?
Do you think they're bipolar?

37:22.500 --> 37:24.458
I know some bears are bipolar.

37:25.625 --> 37:27.250
-Was Kevin training them to fight?
-No.

37:27.333 --> 37:29.125
I don't think they ever left the house.

37:29.208 --> 37:30.916
-I gotta get keys.
-Hang on.

37:31.000 --> 37:32.541
No need.

37:36.166 --> 37:38.083
A nice little lab.

37:38.166 --> 37:41.583
-No kidding. A budding chemist.
-Not bad, Kevin.

37:42.500 --> 37:43.750
Pretty nice, my man.

37:43.833 --> 37:45.791
-What is this?
-Very organized.

37:45.875 --> 37:48.000
Okay.

37:49.583 --> 37:51.666
-Nasal decongestant.
-Hell of a cold.

37:51.750 --> 37:55.125
They use this to make methamphetamine.
See these crystals here?

37:56.333 --> 37:58.000
You studied chemistry?

37:58.083 --> 37:59.458
I've studied <i>Breaking Bad.</i>

37:59.541 --> 38:00.375
Coke.

38:02.250 --> 38:05.083
-Oxycodone.
-Hang on. Don't move.

38:05.166 --> 38:06.375
What are you doing?

38:06.958 --> 38:09.583
Sending it to a friend
in Narcotics.

38:09.666 --> 38:12.666
Yasmine… You two still talk?

38:14.208 --> 38:15.458
Why? What do you care?

38:15.541 --> 38:17.583
Oh, okay. You're not mad at her?

38:17.666 --> 38:19.125
Dude, I'm not mad at you.

38:19.208 --> 38:22.083
-Quit bugging me about that.
-Right. Nice double standard.

38:24.208 --> 38:26.625
Man, you could
kill a horse with this much.

38:26.708 --> 38:28.750
-Shit. The dogs.
-What about them?

38:29.583 --> 38:31.916
He tested product on them.
They're guinea pigs.

38:33.375 --> 38:35.166
-Mrs. Marchal?
-Yes?

38:35.250 --> 38:38.333
Can you tell us anything
about the people your son hung out with?

38:38.416 --> 38:40.583
Well, there was this girl. Jessica.

38:41.916 --> 38:44.541
He went to see her sometimes.
I think she works at a bar.

38:45.541 --> 38:46.375
Hold on.

38:47.041 --> 38:48.666
Is it by chance this bar?

38:49.666 --> 38:50.833
That's the one.

39:04.458 --> 39:05.541
Ah!

39:06.416 --> 39:07.833
-Strip.
-Yeah.

39:07.916 --> 39:09.125
Mmm.

39:09.208 --> 39:11.125
That means we might see naked women.

39:11.750 --> 39:14.375
-And?
-No, nothing. You've been warned.

39:15.458 --> 39:16.708
You're a dick.

39:17.541 --> 39:20.208
-You got a hanky?
-Why do you need a hanky?

39:20.791 --> 39:22.916
-You're sweating.
-Stop talking.

39:26.833 --> 39:28.166
-Hello.
-Miss.

39:28.250 --> 39:29.250
We're not open yet.

39:30.708 --> 39:31.916
You are now.

39:32.500 --> 39:33.708
We need to speak with Jessica.

39:39.125 --> 39:41.583
-Which way are the dressing rooms?
-Um…

39:41.666 --> 39:43.000
-Down there.
-Thank you.

39:43.750 --> 39:44.666
Okay. I'm going.

39:46.250 --> 39:47.625
-To the dressing rooms?
-Yeah.

39:48.458 --> 39:49.583
You sure?

39:50.333 --> 39:51.333
You're a dickhead.

39:51.416 --> 39:52.416
Mmm.

40:01.916 --> 40:02.750
Excuse me.

40:04.208 --> 40:05.041
Well, hi.

40:06.791 --> 40:07.916
And you are?

40:08.000 --> 40:10.708
Uh… Yeah. Police.

40:12.750 --> 40:13.708
One moment.

40:16.833 --> 40:17.958
François. François.

40:19.416 --> 40:20.333
Um…

40:22.291 --> 40:23.291
You should go.

40:23.791 --> 40:25.333
-Why?
-It's better this way.

40:25.833 --> 40:28.041
Well… Oh!

40:28.125 --> 40:29.291
-You have issues.
-What?

40:29.375 --> 40:30.916
-Very sad.
-What? Hey--

40:31.000 --> 40:33.208
-You have issues with women.
-What does that mean? Go.

40:35.000 --> 40:37.291
-Jessica?
-Hm?

40:38.041 --> 40:40.083
Captain Monge. Paris Criminal Division.

40:40.166 --> 40:43.125
-What is this? A parade?
-I wanna talk about Kevin Marchal.

40:43.208 --> 40:45.083
-Is he okay?
-No, he's dead.

40:46.166 --> 40:47.125
He was murdered.

40:49.666 --> 40:51.208
I knew this wouldn't end well.

40:54.416 --> 40:55.250
Rub my back?

40:57.208 --> 40:58.333
As you wish.

40:59.625 --> 41:00.750
No problem.

41:09.416 --> 41:10.250
That okay?

41:10.333 --> 41:12.291
-I mean, my hands aren't too cold?
-No.

41:12.375 --> 41:13.416
No.

41:13.500 --> 41:14.583
Okay, now you answer.

41:15.541 --> 41:16.958
Come on, let's not make this boring.

41:17.041 --> 41:19.750
Here's how it works.
I ask you questions, and you answer.

41:20.458 --> 41:22.083
You remind me of this joke, bro.

41:22.166 --> 41:24.500
Aah! He speaks!
And he called me bro.

41:24.583 --> 41:26.916
-I'd say that's progress.
-It's about a…

41:27.000 --> 41:29.375
What do you call, um…

41:30.208 --> 41:31.125
A man of color.

41:32.166 --> 41:33.125
Can't wait to hear this.

41:33.208 --> 41:35.458
He walks into a bar
with a parrot on his shoulder.

41:35.541 --> 41:38.041
The bartender sees him,
says, "Wow! He's beautiful!"

41:38.125 --> 41:39.375
"Where did you get him?"

41:41.041 --> 41:42.166
Okay? Where'd he get him?

41:42.750 --> 41:44.375
The parrot answers, "In Africa."

41:45.583 --> 41:47.916
In Africa!

41:48.000 --> 41:49.541
In Africa? Aah!

41:49.625 --> 41:51.625
-'Cause the parrot says it.
-Right!

41:51.708 --> 41:54.166
Wow, that's a good one.
Well, it's racist, but it's a good one.

41:54.250 --> 41:55.750
-Racist towards who?
-Black people.

41:55.833 --> 41:57.500
-Oh, come on.
<i>-Un poquito.</i>

41:57.583 --> 42:01.208
Sorry, shouldn't speak Spanish.
Don't wanna provoke you. But it's racist.

42:01.291 --> 42:02.500
So, Kevin Marchal.

42:02.583 --> 42:05.250
I don't talk
to Sub-Saharan immigrants. Sorry.

42:06.083 --> 42:08.625
And I usually don't talk
to racist sons of bitches.

42:08.708 --> 42:11.375
But let's both give it a shot, okay?
You got that, partner?

42:12.833 --> 42:14.208
Oh! Guess it's my turn.

42:14.750 --> 42:16.833
Hey! Are you out of your mind?

42:17.791 --> 42:19.500
I just cleaned in here!

42:19.583 --> 42:20.708
Oh, no. No!

42:30.250 --> 42:31.791
I mean, it was fun at first.

42:32.375 --> 42:34.208
Despite his wild side, he was a sweet guy.

42:34.291 --> 42:35.250
Sure.

42:35.333 --> 42:37.291
But that stuff he was making…

42:39.958 --> 42:41.958
-Sorry. So he was dealing?
-He used to.

42:42.041 --> 42:43.833
-With his buddy, the Snitch.
-Who's he?

42:44.458 --> 42:45.291
Nader.

42:47.000 --> 42:48.541
They call him the Snitch.

42:50.333 --> 42:52.416
He works at the laser tag place
at the mall.

42:52.500 --> 42:55.541
They got in a fight when he found out
Kevin was making his own drugs.

42:55.625 --> 42:57.125
They were doing pretty good business.

42:58.375 --> 43:00.500
-François] Uh-huh?
-They'd deal in nightclubs.

43:01.375 --> 43:02.208
In raves.

43:04.791 --> 43:06.833
You don't have to do my butt.

43:10.541 --> 43:11.375
Okay.

43:11.458 --> 43:12.583
-Thanks.
-You're very welcome.

43:21.750 --> 43:23.125
Come on. Come on!

43:29.083 --> 43:31.625
We met up, like, two weeks ago.

43:31.708 --> 43:35.083
He was really nervous, like he…
was spooked about something.

43:35.666 --> 43:37.041
-I don't know.
-François!

43:37.125 --> 43:38.416
François!

43:38.500 --> 43:39.625
And that guy gets chief.

43:58.666 --> 44:00.458
God damn!

44:00.541 --> 44:03.208
Damn! Hey, this guy's nuts.
He's fucking crazy.

44:03.291 --> 44:06.333
I'll show you. This ain't over.
This ain't over!

44:06.833 --> 44:08.250
Damn it. Coming!

44:19.000 --> 44:20.166
Idiot…

44:21.166 --> 44:23.291
There's a reason
this is against fucking protocol.

44:27.083 --> 44:28.791
Oh shit!

44:28.875 --> 44:30.875
Fuck! Aah! Shit!

44:30.958 --> 44:33.708
Oh, come on, come on, come on!

44:34.541 --> 44:35.375
No!

44:37.333 --> 44:39.333
Oh, fuck!

44:54.958 --> 44:55.791
Fuck!

44:58.291 --> 44:59.125
Shit!

45:27.291 --> 45:29.041
First warning! Hands on your head!

45:40.375 --> 45:41.791
Hey…

45:41.875 --> 45:43.291
Uh… Uh…

45:43.375 --> 45:44.916
This is your second warning?

45:50.833 --> 45:52.333
What the fuck?

46:19.375 --> 46:20.208
He's dead.

46:30.750 --> 46:33.500
Weird. No pain, didn't tire.

46:34.583 --> 46:35.666
The guy was on drugs.

46:36.833 --> 46:38.875
Yeah, sure.

46:39.458 --> 46:40.625
What do you mean, "sure"?

46:40.708 --> 46:44.333
Listen, Ousmane. You got your ass kicked.
You don't have to make excuses.

46:45.208 --> 46:48.041
All because of a joke.
It was tasteless, I'll give you that--

46:48.125 --> 46:49.416
No, it wasn't tasteless.

46:49.500 --> 46:52.666
-It was racist. Not the same.
-Oh! In the original, it's a monkey.

46:53.250 --> 46:55.208
I think you're being overly sens--

46:57.166 --> 46:58.208
You were saying?

46:58.291 --> 47:00.083
GET OUT, NEGROES AND HOMOS

47:00.166 --> 47:01.416
Am I still too sensitive?

47:03.500 --> 47:05.250
God! What a shitty town. Damn!

47:06.000 --> 47:08.458
Look at this. They even broke the window!

47:08.541 --> 47:10.041
The window? Come on, guys…

47:10.125 --> 47:12.583
Why do people do this?
Seriously. Why break the window?

47:12.666 --> 47:15.291
And I understand the N-word,
but "homos"? Really?

47:15.375 --> 47:17.333
-What was that?
-Come again?

47:17.416 --> 47:19.750
-I heard you. I want an explanation.
-You don't understand.

47:19.833 --> 47:22.333
No, I don't. Give me the keys, please.

47:22.416 --> 47:23.750
Oh shit, uh…

47:25.708 --> 47:27.833
I… I strategically placed them
under the car.

47:28.416 --> 47:30.416
-You left the keys under the car?
-Yes!

47:37.166 --> 47:40.458
Carl Müller. License revoked
two years ago. Nothing too egregious.

47:40.541 --> 47:43.041
He worked for a security company.
Securitec.

47:43.125 --> 47:45.583
-Guess we should pay them a visit.
-Hmm.

47:46.250 --> 47:49.125
He had this tattooed on his neck.
Mean something to you?

47:49.208 --> 47:52.000
-No.
-If it isn't our friends from the capital!

47:52.083 --> 47:53.791
How are you? I'm Chief Mercier.

47:53.875 --> 47:55.375
-Pleasure to meet you.
-Pleasure's mine.

47:55.458 --> 47:58.791
We're waiting for the autopsy.
Hopefully, it confirms cardiac arrest.

47:58.875 --> 48:01.833
-Or was it self-defense?
-I was attacked.

48:01.916 --> 48:02.958
Verbally and physically.

48:03.041 --> 48:05.250
-What more do you need?
-The guy was kinda tough.

48:05.333 --> 48:07.416
No, the guy was on drugs.

48:07.500 --> 48:09.083
Reminds me of a kid I saw at a rave.

48:09.166 --> 48:12.041
He had a bad trip on laced ecstasy.
Took three guys to stop him.

48:12.125 --> 48:14.583
Let's compare Carl's results
with the stuff we found at Kevin's.

48:14.666 --> 48:17.916
Two dead bodies in two days
is way above our average.

48:18.000 --> 48:19.500
I need you to stop the body count,

48:19.583 --> 48:22.833
and wrap this up quickly,
quietly and with a sure hand, hm?

48:22.916 --> 48:27.166
-That sounds like us. I do quiet jobs.
-And he does hand jobs? Not surprised.

48:28.583 --> 48:30.708
Gauthier, stick to procedure.
Record everything.

48:30.791 --> 48:34.125
Of course, boss. Sometimes,
he mixes up captain and secretary.

48:34.208 --> 48:35.625
-I have that problem.
-That right?

48:35.708 --> 48:38.708
Some people think a captain works under
the chief. We're more like co-chiefs.

48:38.791 --> 48:39.875
Hmm.

48:39.958 --> 48:43.666
Oh! Kevin's tests.
Traces of cocaine and cannabis. Uh…

48:44.250 --> 48:45.666
Just like most of the kids here.

48:46.500 --> 48:48.166
He's not a dealer or addict. He's a cook.

48:48.750 --> 48:52.041
Speaking of cooks, are you hungry?
We've done enough for one day.

48:52.125 --> 48:53.250
What's the local specialty?

48:54.708 --> 48:55.541
Hm.

48:55.625 --> 48:58.333
Mmm!

48:58.916 --> 49:00.208
-Mmm.
-Mmm!

49:00.291 --> 49:01.500
-Mmm. Delicious.
-Mm-hm?

49:01.583 --> 49:03.125
-Mmm! It's tasty.
-Mm.

49:03.208 --> 49:05.416
You can't go back
without trying our <i>croissoufflé.</i>

49:05.916 --> 49:08.333
And crunchy, mmm,
but it melts in your mouth.

49:08.416 --> 49:10.000
Mmm, mmm. So good!

49:10.875 --> 49:12.500
-Mmm.
-God, I'm just pigging out.

49:13.083 --> 49:17.291
I was worried that tripe, pasta
and Raclette cheese would be too heavy.

49:17.375 --> 49:18.583
But it's not at all.

49:18.666 --> 49:21.166
-That's right.
-Not at all. You wanna know why?

49:21.250 --> 49:24.291
They don't use heavy cream.
They use <i>yog-</i>urt.

49:25.458 --> 49:26.375
What?

49:27.083 --> 49:29.333
-It's <i>yog</i>-urt.
-<i>Yoh</i>-gurt!

49:30.291 --> 49:32.500
-Yogurt.
-No "yog-urt." Oh. Oh. "Yoh-gurt."

49:32.583 --> 49:34.875
-But the "O" is silent. Yog-urt.
-No. Yoh-gurt.

49:34.958 --> 49:37.291
-I've always said yog-urt. How about you?
-Uh, yoh-gurt.

49:37.375 --> 49:38.375
-Really?
-See, told you.

49:38.458 --> 49:41.458
-I've always said yog-urt.
-How about "sp-yoon" while you're at it?

49:41.541 --> 49:44.291
-I'm sure both are correct.
-Where'd you learn that?

49:44.791 --> 49:47.250
At "sch-yool"?
Where you wrote on the "wh-yite board"?

49:47.333 --> 49:49.666
-Whatever.
-There are no "ryules" for the table.

49:49.750 --> 49:52.958
-I'm afraid we must "gyo."
-Perhaps I should "cyall you a cyarriage."

49:53.041 --> 49:55.166
All right! Are you done yet?

49:55.250 --> 49:57.166
Alice? May I call you that?

49:57.250 --> 49:58.458
Of course you can.

49:59.250 --> 50:00.750
Tell me, Alice…

50:00.833 --> 50:02.708
-Hmm?
-Excuse me.

50:04.166 --> 50:05.750
-What's a girl like you--
-Excuse me.

50:08.791 --> 50:09.916
…doing in this line of work?

50:10.000 --> 50:11.875
What do you mean, a girl like me?

50:11.958 --> 50:14.208
-Well--
-Means you're hot.

50:14.291 --> 50:15.416
Sorry?

50:16.250 --> 50:18.166
Come on, we don't need to sugar-coat it.

50:18.250 --> 50:21.625
Alice is a ravishing young woman.
Pointing it out isn't a crime.

50:21.708 --> 50:23.500
You're being a creep.

50:24.416 --> 50:25.416
The Veile family!

50:26.083 --> 50:27.750
-How are you doing? Hello.
-Mr. Mayor.

50:27.833 --> 50:28.791
-Hey.
-How are you?

50:28.875 --> 50:30.291
-Hey, good evening.
-How are you?

50:30.375 --> 50:31.541
I'm great.

50:32.375 --> 50:34.041
-Hmm.
-Peter! How's it going?

50:34.125 --> 50:35.791
-How's business?
-Isn't that the mayor?

50:35.875 --> 50:37.958
-It's his second home.
-I'll stop in soon.

50:38.041 --> 50:40.458
Literally. He owns the restaurant
and a bunch of other places.

50:40.541 --> 50:42.416
Right, I get it. Brunner City, huh?

50:42.500 --> 50:45.250
When the local economy crashed,
he bought everything

50:45.333 --> 50:48.750
and created thousands of jobs,
so, of course, when he ran for mayor…

50:49.625 --> 50:51.083
Ms. Deputy Captain.

50:51.583 --> 50:53.166
-Mr. Mayor. Hi.
-Good evening.

50:53.250 --> 50:54.833
-Pleasure to meet--
-Ah, don't get up.

50:57.000 --> 50:59.333
-You're both from Paris, aren't you?
-Yeah.

50:59.416 --> 51:01.166
You're here about the death
of Kevin Marchal?

51:01.250 --> 51:04.166
-News travels fast.
-Poor kid. It's terrible.

51:04.833 --> 51:07.166
Terrible. You know,
that's why I work so hard.

51:07.250 --> 51:10.541
So young people can thrive here,
away from violence and the drug trade.

51:10.625 --> 51:13.166
Anyway, I hope
you find the culprit quickly

51:13.250 --> 51:15.291
and that it won't keep you
from enjoying our town.

51:15.375 --> 51:17.458
-I see you're off to a nice start.
-Yeah.

51:18.250 --> 51:22.250
To accompany this meal, I'd recommend
a glass of Chartreuse. It's made in house.

51:22.333 --> 51:24.041
Mickael? Three.

51:25.708 --> 51:28.166
-Have you been here before?
-No, but we feel at home.

51:28.250 --> 51:30.750
It's clean. And welcoming.

51:31.333 --> 51:34.958
I actually came here
a while ago with my grandma.

51:35.041 --> 51:37.458
We were visiting one of the resorts.

51:37.541 --> 51:40.916
It was a magical place. What?
Their spa was absolutely exquisite.

51:41.000 --> 51:42.750
Yeah. Don't care.

51:43.250 --> 51:44.250
Excuse him.

51:44.958 --> 51:47.333
-I hope you enjoy your evening.
-Thanks.

51:47.416 --> 51:48.541
-Thanks.
-Bye, now.

51:48.625 --> 51:49.750
-Thanks, Mr. Mayor.
-Bye.

51:50.791 --> 51:53.791
Hey, isn't that nice?
The mayor coming to the restaurant…

51:53.875 --> 51:55.875
-Oh, right. Thanks, Mickael.
-Thanks.

51:55.958 --> 51:58.958
So one drink, a pat on the back,
and you're sold.

51:59.041 --> 52:00.375
You'd vote for Hitler.

52:00.458 --> 52:02.791
Well, to your
coalition with the provinces.

52:02.875 --> 52:04.625
-Cheers.
-Mmm.

52:08.958 --> 52:10.125
Tastes like goat piss.

52:16.583 --> 52:17.416
I'm sorry.

52:18.791 --> 52:21.500
-I ate way too much.
-Ever heard of self-restraint?

52:22.291 --> 52:25.000
It's not me, it's the cookie
that came with the coffee.

52:25.083 --> 52:26.416
Cinnamon makes me bloated.

52:26.500 --> 52:27.375
Here we are.

52:28.250 --> 52:29.291
Hmm.

52:30.916 --> 52:32.708
-You're joking?
-Sorry. We're on a budget.

52:34.833 --> 52:36.750
-It's perfect. Thanks.
-Mm-hm.

52:37.875 --> 52:39.916
And thanks for tonight. It was great.

52:40.000 --> 52:41.083
Hmm.

52:42.333 --> 52:43.500
It's all great.

52:43.583 --> 52:45.041
Mmm.

52:48.875 --> 52:50.958
-Oh, sure. I'll get your bag.
-Good night.

52:51.041 --> 52:52.000
Good night.

52:57.708 --> 52:59.125
I'm tired. Come on.

52:59.208 --> 53:00.833
-Okay, Dad. All right.
-Come on!

53:01.416 --> 53:03.333
-See you.
-Yeah, have a good night.

53:08.625 --> 53:09.458
No, after you.

53:09.541 --> 53:10.750
-No, go ahead.
-Go ahead.

53:12.333 --> 53:14.083
-You said, "go ahead."
-No, you did.

53:14.166 --> 53:15.666
It's fine. Go on.

53:17.416 --> 53:19.625
You're kidding me.

53:24.083 --> 53:25.791
Can I help you?

53:25.875 --> 53:29.041
-We have two rooms. Diakité and Monge.
-Diaki…

53:30.500 --> 53:32.666
-…té.
-Uh-huh.

53:34.041 --> 53:36.000
Oh, yeah. One queen.

53:36.083 --> 53:37.875
No. No, there's two of us.

53:37.958 --> 53:39.916
-So, two rooms.
-Hm.

53:40.583 --> 53:42.875
No, this says one room for two people.

53:42.958 --> 53:45.416
Fine. Forget it.
Give me my own room, please. I'll pay.

53:45.500 --> 53:46.958
We're all booked up, sorry.

53:48.041 --> 53:50.250
Totally full
'cause of the conference. It's…

53:50.333 --> 53:52.166
totally… full.

53:53.250 --> 53:54.083
It's fine.

53:59.416 --> 54:01.041
Really?

54:01.125 --> 54:02.500
Right. Of course.

54:02.583 --> 54:04.708
I call the window side.

54:06.916 --> 54:09.333
If populism means
listening to your fellow citizens

54:09.416 --> 54:13.666
and trying to improve their lives,
then yes, I am a populist.

54:13.750 --> 54:14.791
And proud of it.

54:14.875 --> 54:18.000
<i>What kind of message are we sending</i>
<i>these unfortunate people?</i>

54:18.083 --> 54:21.500
<i>"Come to our country.</i>
<i>We'll provide for you." It's fiction!</i>

54:21.583 --> 54:25.375
<i>All that's waiting</i>
<i>is poverty and deprivation.</i>

54:25.458 --> 54:29.458
<i>It's time to stop dangling carrots</i>
<i>and to stop making promises we can't keep.</i>

54:38.750 --> 54:39.708
What you doin'?

54:40.625 --> 54:42.708
Oh, my bad. Sorry. Forgot you were there.

54:44.750 --> 54:46.583
Excuse me.

54:56.833 --> 54:58.833
-There. Happy?
-Do I look happy?

55:00.291 --> 55:03.250
You think I'm gonna sleep next to you
like that? Hell, no.

55:03.333 --> 55:04.916
-Why not?
-Because.

55:05.416 --> 55:07.000
-Because why?
-Just because.

55:07.083 --> 55:09.041
-Of course, "just because."
-Damn straight.

55:09.125 --> 55:11.208
Well, I can't sleep unless I'm naked.

55:11.291 --> 55:12.541
Look, I even left my T-shirt on.

55:12.625 --> 55:15.375
The T-shirt is not the problem.
Your balls are out!

55:15.458 --> 55:17.541
Like a white Winnie-the-Pooh.

55:20.000 --> 55:22.666
What's going on with you? Are you afraid?

55:23.708 --> 55:27.500
Afraid that I'll awaken
some hidden desire or something?

55:27.583 --> 55:30.833
You got me. Now go pick up your briefs
and put 'em on.

55:31.458 --> 55:32.791
I'd appreciate it.

55:32.875 --> 55:36.250
You need to get more comfortable
with the human body.

55:36.333 --> 55:37.750
My body is fine.

55:37.833 --> 55:39.666
It's your naked ass
I don't want next to me.

55:39.750 --> 55:41.375
Yeah, you're not a prude at all…

55:44.083 --> 55:45.083
There we go.

55:45.166 --> 55:46.791
-We okay now?
-Yeah. We're good.

55:46.875 --> 55:49.166
-Okay, all right. Good night.
-All right, good night.

56:03.625 --> 56:04.458
François.

56:13.666 --> 56:14.750
Nasty.

56:20.583 --> 56:22.916
Looks like the local
security business is booming.

56:23.000 --> 56:24.500
-Are you sulking?
-No.

56:24.583 --> 56:25.708
What's the matter?

56:25.791 --> 56:27.916
You should've had breakfast.
They had smoked sausage.

56:28.000 --> 56:29.208
-I'm fine.
-Gives you energy.

56:29.291 --> 56:30.791
Sleep gives me energy.

56:31.875 --> 56:34.125
Your nose makes a weird noise
when you sleep.

56:34.750 --> 56:35.833
See a doctor, sniffy.

56:35.916 --> 56:37.958
-My nose is perfect. Runs in the family.
-Hmm.

56:38.041 --> 56:40.916
We got Carl's results.
Amphetamines and steroids.

56:41.000 --> 56:43.666
-Just like Kevin.
-Told you. The guy was on drugs.

56:44.833 --> 56:46.208
And he beat your ass.

56:46.833 --> 56:49.500
-Because he was on drugs.
-Right.

56:50.708 --> 56:51.541
That's right.

56:52.125 --> 56:54.541
SECURITEC
RECEPTION, VISITORS/DELIVERIES

56:56.208 --> 56:57.458
Okay, Ousmane.

56:58.041 --> 56:58.875
Ousmane!

57:00.125 --> 57:01.791
The guys behind this door
worked with Carl.

57:01.875 --> 57:03.875
They're probably all on the same drug.

57:03.958 --> 57:04.791
Yeah, so?

57:04.875 --> 57:07.541
So I think it's best if I take the lead
this time and you hang back,

57:07.625 --> 57:09.625
so we avoid a situation
like the one at The Cherry.

57:10.208 --> 57:11.291
What situation?

57:12.000 --> 57:13.208
Ah, right!

57:14.250 --> 57:15.250
The fight!

57:15.791 --> 57:17.916
-You sure?
-It's safer.

57:19.958 --> 57:20.958
Okay.

57:21.833 --> 57:22.666
Okay.

57:27.666 --> 57:28.666
What's up, gym rats?

57:29.375 --> 57:31.833
Don't stop on our account.
We're just the police.

57:31.916 --> 57:34.375
That's right.
Those annoying cops are here.

57:34.458 --> 57:36.375
Which one of you cupcakes is in charge?

57:36.458 --> 57:37.958
Here we go.

57:39.791 --> 57:40.791
Nobody move.

57:43.791 --> 57:45.416
We want to speak to the manager.

57:45.500 --> 57:47.041
You didn't give a warning.

57:48.208 --> 57:49.875
Oh, right, sorry. First warning.

57:49.958 --> 57:52.666
-You have to say it before.
-It's too late.

57:54.000 --> 57:56.583
All right, Stallone, you can move.

57:57.166 --> 58:00.000
Goran Jurdik. I'm the boss.
What do you want?

58:00.083 --> 58:02.041
Hey, there he is! Leader of the cupcakes.

58:02.125 --> 58:04.458
-Look around while we chat.
-Huh? But…

58:05.416 --> 58:08.125
It's good to meet you, sir.

58:08.208 --> 58:09.916
Please, man. You too.

58:10.000 --> 58:12.333
Back up. Right now. Make some room.

58:14.291 --> 58:16.166
Carl Müller, does it ring a bell?

58:16.250 --> 58:18.416
Yeah, sure, I know him.
Haven't seen him today.

58:23.083 --> 58:25.875
-Does he have a locker?
-You'd know better if he's in custody.

58:25.958 --> 58:29.291
-You know if he keeps anything here?
-Yeah. Over there.

58:29.916 --> 58:31.458
François, the locker room.

58:36.375 --> 58:37.375
Kevin Marchal.

58:38.041 --> 58:39.333
No. Don't know him.

58:39.416 --> 58:40.458
Of course not.

58:40.541 --> 58:42.750
"N-words and homos" ring any bells?

58:42.833 --> 58:45.166
Doesn't sound familiar to me.

58:45.250 --> 58:47.083
But that's a good start.

58:49.375 --> 58:52.333
Is it the mountain air,
or are your friends pretty doped up?

58:53.166 --> 58:54.375
Huh. Well…

58:54.916 --> 58:57.791
We could do urine samples if you want.
Guys'd love that.

58:57.875 --> 58:59.166
Cups are by the coffee.

59:12.125 --> 59:13.291
Oh, hello.

59:13.375 --> 59:15.541
Lovely voice.

59:18.375 --> 59:19.875
Hm.

59:19.958 --> 59:21.791
What's that tattoo you all have?

59:21.875 --> 59:24.583
What, this?
It's the symbol of the Sons of Clovis.

59:24.666 --> 59:26.666
-What's that?
-It's a discussion group.

59:26.750 --> 59:30.291
We get together
and discuss our shared values.

59:30.375 --> 59:33.666
I get the idea. A cross between
a book club and Fascists Anonymous.

59:33.750 --> 59:35.125
Huh.

59:49.583 --> 59:50.666
You okay, François?

59:50.750 --> 59:52.083
Oh, yeah, I'm good.

59:53.541 --> 59:55.375
Well, I think we all better go now.

59:55.458 --> 59:57.208
Really? Why? We're having fun.

59:57.291 --> 59:59.333
Even though there's
not a lot of color in here.

59:59.416 --> 1:00:01.333
It seems to range from white to whiter.

1:00:01.416 --> 1:00:02.875
Light white.

1:00:04.000 --> 1:00:04.833
Dark white.

1:00:04.916 --> 1:00:06.750
Hmm. What else we got?

1:00:07.500 --> 1:00:09.791
Oh! Two eggshell whites.

1:00:09.875 --> 1:00:11.500
Ah! Red white!

1:00:11.583 --> 1:00:14.916
You gotta be careful. Nothing less
than SPF 50. We in the mountains here.

1:00:15.833 --> 1:00:16.875
Sun's closer.

1:00:19.625 --> 1:00:23.250
Hey, bud, you got a warrant
to come stir all this shit up in here?

1:00:23.333 --> 1:00:25.750
-"Bud"?
-What? I didn't think so.

1:00:26.416 --> 1:00:27.875
Get this clown out of here.

1:00:28.583 --> 1:00:29.750
Nobody move!

1:00:30.375 --> 1:00:31.583
First warning.

1:00:34.291 --> 1:00:35.916
See, Ousmane? That wasn't so hard.

1:00:36.000 --> 1:00:39.250
Our friend Carl does have a locker.
Guess what's inside?

1:00:41.375 --> 1:00:42.375
Tokarev.

1:00:49.416 --> 1:00:51.833
So, Carl was
one of Kevin's customers.

1:00:51.916 --> 1:00:54.208
They had a falling-out
when he fell off the railroad bridge.

1:00:54.291 --> 1:00:56.416
-Yeah.
-And the Sons of Clovis?

1:00:56.500 --> 1:01:00.250
Come on. They don't see the world like
you do. That doesn't make them criminals.

1:01:00.333 --> 1:01:02.125
Carl had a pick-up truck.
We didn't find it.

1:01:02.208 --> 1:01:04.416
But the debris on the road
and the tire tracks match.

1:01:04.500 --> 1:01:06.000
-All right.
-Same with ballistics.

1:01:06.083 --> 1:01:08.750
They confirmed it.
Looks like you found the murder weapon.

1:01:08.833 --> 1:01:11.666
I call that a clean sweep.

1:01:11.750 --> 1:01:16.375
Congratulations. Your methods
are questionable, but those results…

1:01:17.833 --> 1:01:19.583
-You too, Gauthier.
-Hmm.

1:01:19.666 --> 1:01:20.750
Thank you, Chief.

1:01:21.458 --> 1:01:23.333
First compliment in 18 months. Thanks.

1:01:23.416 --> 1:01:25.416
Too bad it went by so fast.

1:01:25.500 --> 1:01:27.875
Oh, also,
I'm going up to Paris in a month.

1:01:27.958 --> 1:01:29.875
We should meet up. Ousmane?

1:01:30.916 --> 1:01:32.166
Ousmane?

1:01:33.125 --> 1:01:35.958
-Ousmane? Ousmane? Can I call you?
-Yeah.

1:01:36.041 --> 1:01:38.541
Yeah, yeah. Great.
Are those guys just leaving?

1:01:40.875 --> 1:01:43.916
Apart from a criminal fashion sense,
we don't have anything on them.

1:01:46.833 --> 1:01:48.083
You don't wanna miss your train.

1:02:05.583 --> 1:02:07.583
Are you in love? Hmm?

1:02:08.333 --> 1:02:10.625
She's nice,
but there's more fish in the sea.

1:02:10.708 --> 1:02:12.458
Anyway, you handled it like a pro.

1:02:13.791 --> 1:02:15.916
-We just got screwed over.
-It's a game, dude.

1:02:16.000 --> 1:02:19.416
-Don't take it so seriously.
-It can't just be between Carl and Kevin.

1:02:19.500 --> 1:02:21.416
-Oh.
-It's too perfect. It's too clean.

1:02:21.500 --> 1:02:24.500
-We found the gun in his locker.
-Anyone could have put it there.

1:02:24.583 --> 1:02:26.458
-Including Carl.
-Or the Sons of Clovis.

1:02:27.416 --> 1:02:30.291
Carl's the ideal culprit.
He can't talk anymore.

1:02:30.375 --> 1:02:32.791
So the case is closed
and everyone goes home.

1:02:34.458 --> 1:02:36.500
We haven't followed up on all the leads.

1:02:37.125 --> 1:02:39.875
Where are you going?
Hey! The train's coming in two minutes.

1:02:39.958 --> 1:02:41.416
We're gonna go talk to the Snitch.

1:02:44.625 --> 1:02:46.375
LASER TAG

1:02:46.458 --> 1:02:47.375
Hi, there.

1:02:47.458 --> 1:02:49.125
-Hey, guys. Are you here to play?
-Hello.

1:02:49.208 --> 1:02:51.125
-No. We're looking for Nader. Is he here?
-Uh…

1:02:51.208 --> 1:02:53.250
-The Snitch.
-He's back there.

1:02:53.333 --> 1:02:56.083
He's in the middle of a game.
Sir, you can't just go in there!

1:02:56.166 --> 1:02:57.583
-Hey! Sir, stop!
-<i>Fight.</i>

1:02:57.666 --> 1:03:00.500
Ladies and gentlemen,
I hope your vests are strapped on.

1:03:00.583 --> 1:03:02.250
This one sure isn't.

1:03:02.333 --> 1:03:04.625
As a reminder,
when a member of your team gets shot,

1:03:04.708 --> 1:03:06.583
you automatically lose
no less than ten points.

1:03:06.666 --> 1:03:09.000
Not respecting the safety measures
will result

1:03:09.083 --> 1:03:11.083
in an immediate ejection from the game.

1:03:11.166 --> 1:03:12.083
Are you ready?

1:03:12.166 --> 1:03:13.375
Yeah!

1:03:13.458 --> 1:03:16.375
-Yeah!
-Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Goooo!

1:03:16.458 --> 1:03:18.583
Go! Go!

1:03:18.666 --> 1:03:20.083
-Go…
-Come here. Police.

1:03:20.166 --> 1:03:21.458
Oh, why you runnin'?

1:03:28.791 --> 1:03:30.125
-Go, go!
-Go!

1:03:31.875 --> 1:03:34.125
Oh!

1:03:36.041 --> 1:03:36.875
Nader!

1:03:36.958 --> 1:03:39.208
That's the last one!

1:03:51.208 --> 1:03:53.375
Nader! Come here!

1:03:54.000 --> 1:03:56.250
What the hell are you doing?
I almost had him!

1:03:58.250 --> 1:03:59.416
Get him!

1:04:01.041 --> 1:04:02.250
Wait. There!

1:04:03.458 --> 1:04:04.500
Son of a bitch!

1:04:05.375 --> 1:04:06.375
Shit!

1:04:11.625 --> 1:04:12.833
Get back here!

1:04:13.416 --> 1:04:14.250
Nader!

1:04:24.791 --> 1:04:26.958
I don't think
we've got the right shoes!

1:04:27.041 --> 1:04:28.458
Ah! Let go!

1:04:40.833 --> 1:04:42.916
Nader! Nader!

1:04:43.000 --> 1:04:44.833
-What are you--
-Hey!

1:04:46.083 --> 1:04:46.916
Hey!

1:04:50.458 --> 1:04:52.000
-Hey, hey!
-Please!

1:04:52.083 --> 1:04:54.166
-Police!
-What the hell's going on?

1:04:54.250 --> 1:04:57.041
Gonna need your kart, ma'am. Ah!

1:05:05.458 --> 1:05:07.208
Hey. Hey!

1:05:08.291 --> 1:05:09.375
Blind dickhead!

1:05:16.375 --> 1:05:19.250
-Police! Out of the kart!
-What do you want? I didn't do anything!

1:05:19.833 --> 1:05:20.958
Pull over!

1:05:21.041 --> 1:05:23.416
-Get him! Get him! Right there!
-Stop!

1:05:23.500 --> 1:05:25.083
-Out of the way!
-Stop!

1:05:25.166 --> 1:05:28.333
-Police! You gotta block him!
-You gotta block him!

1:05:28.416 --> 1:05:29.666
Go, go! Get him!

1:05:29.750 --> 1:05:31.541
Damn it! What are you doing?

1:05:33.625 --> 1:05:34.666
Police!

1:05:37.458 --> 1:05:38.541
Stop!

1:05:39.666 --> 1:05:41.500
I'm innocent! Swear to God!

1:05:41.583 --> 1:05:43.291
We're the authorities!

1:05:43.958 --> 1:05:45.125
Hey!

1:05:46.041 --> 1:05:48.458
Look at this! See this?

1:05:49.708 --> 1:05:51.250
Stop right now!

1:05:54.541 --> 1:05:55.916
Hey! Holy shit.

1:05:56.708 --> 1:05:57.875
Police!

1:05:59.583 --> 1:06:01.083
That's enough, young man. Come back!

1:06:01.166 --> 1:06:02.666
-No!
-You're not getting away!

1:06:05.833 --> 1:06:07.875
Nader! You are so grounded!

1:06:10.625 --> 1:06:12.916
No! I didn't do anything!

1:06:14.000 --> 1:06:16.458
You're gonna hurt
these customers! Watch out!

1:06:16.541 --> 1:06:18.333
Look out! Sorry, ma'am. Sorry!

1:06:19.791 --> 1:06:20.791
Sorry! It's slippery.

1:06:20.875 --> 1:06:23.708
-Hey! Nader! Get back here! Nader!
-No!

1:06:23.791 --> 1:06:25.625
Get back here! Don't be stupid!

1:06:25.708 --> 1:06:26.875
-Police!
-Come on!

1:06:26.958 --> 1:06:28.041
Nader, look out!

1:06:30.250 --> 1:06:31.083
Sir, look out!

1:06:31.166 --> 1:06:32.625
To the left, the left!

1:06:32.708 --> 1:06:33.708
Sorry.

1:06:33.791 --> 1:06:35.416
Come on! Outta the way! Hey!

1:06:36.333 --> 1:06:38.250
-Gimme that!
-Nader!

1:06:40.708 --> 1:06:42.208
Out of the way!

1:06:42.291 --> 1:06:43.625
He's throwing stuff at me!

1:06:45.208 --> 1:06:47.375
-Oof!
-Hey! Hey!

1:06:47.958 --> 1:06:50.291
-Nader! What the hell?
-Oh!

1:06:52.333 --> 1:06:53.666
Ground beef!

1:06:55.916 --> 1:06:57.125
Oh shit!

1:06:57.208 --> 1:06:59.291
I almost had him!
What the hell are you doing?

1:06:59.375 --> 1:07:02.083
I'll lead him to breakfast cereal.
You cut him off by home accessories.

1:07:02.166 --> 1:07:04.166
-Okay, let's go.
-We'll hit him from both sides!

1:07:04.250 --> 1:07:05.875
Come on. Go! Go!

1:07:05.958 --> 1:07:07.625
Move, move, move, move!

1:07:09.666 --> 1:07:11.333
Police! Out of the way, okay?

1:07:14.166 --> 1:07:15.500
Hey, hey!

1:07:17.708 --> 1:07:18.625
Shit!

1:07:22.500 --> 1:07:23.875
Clear! Move!

1:07:25.958 --> 1:07:27.666
Oh!

1:07:35.541 --> 1:07:38.291
-Go on. Get back.
-No, you can't do this!

1:07:38.375 --> 1:07:40.875
-Nothing to see here. Keep shopping.
-Am I being arrested?

1:07:40.958 --> 1:07:43.208
-There's a sale on baked goods!
-You're hurting me!

1:07:43.291 --> 1:07:46.083
-Dude! You're hurting me!
-Got your diapers now. Be a big boy.

1:07:46.166 --> 1:07:48.125
Sorry, I shouldn't have
ran away like that.

1:07:48.208 --> 1:07:50.125
But I have a lot of problems
with the police.

1:07:50.208 --> 1:07:52.333
I talk, and it always
gets me into trouble.

1:07:52.416 --> 1:07:54.708
-It's the worst.
-Why do they call you The Snitch?

1:07:54.791 --> 1:07:57.666
-Uh… Well, 'cause of that.
-Talk about Kevin Marchal.

1:07:57.750 --> 1:07:59.375
-Huh?
-You were dealing with him.

1:07:59.458 --> 1:08:01.583
-Too much? You freaked?
-That's not what freaked me out.

1:08:01.666 --> 1:08:03.625
-It was the guys he hung with.
-The Sons of Clovis?

1:08:03.708 --> 1:08:04.958
-Wow. Leading question.
-So what?

1:08:05.041 --> 1:08:07.291
-Allow me. Was it the Sons of Clovis?
-Yeah.

1:08:07.375 --> 1:08:08.666
-There you go.
-There you go.

1:08:08.750 --> 1:08:11.375
-You just said it.
-They think they police the neighborhood.

1:08:11.458 --> 1:08:13.708
-That is a problem.
-They're psychos! Crazy!

1:08:13.791 --> 1:08:16.916
We were afraid to go outside. Even Kevin
freaked, okay? He called the police.

1:08:17.000 --> 1:08:18.416
-Kevin was freaked out?
-Mm-hm.

1:08:18.500 --> 1:08:21.250
-What'd the cops do?
-Well, this one cop came. Uh…

1:08:22.000 --> 1:08:24.083
And he promised to help us out.
It was a chief.

1:08:24.166 --> 1:08:25.750
-Name?
-Morbier.

1:08:25.833 --> 1:08:27.291
-No, not Morbier…
-Was it Mercier?

1:08:27.375 --> 1:08:28.541
Shit, you're doing it again.

1:08:28.625 --> 1:08:31.416
-Come on, what else do you need?
-Shit. Chief Mercier?

1:08:31.500 --> 1:08:32.708
Chief Mercier. Yeah, that's it.

1:08:32.791 --> 1:08:35.208
-Are you kidding me?
-Why would I be? What?

1:08:35.291 --> 1:08:36.416
I just heard you say "Chief."

1:08:36.500 --> 1:08:38.666
-You said "Mercier."
-But he hadn't said "Chief."

1:08:38.750 --> 1:08:41.250
-He looked for the name. That's a detail.
-It's okay.

1:08:41.333 --> 1:08:42.875
-That's not a detail!
-You gave the name.

1:08:42.958 --> 1:08:44.625
-There's only one chief here!
-Don't--

1:08:44.708 --> 1:08:48.708
-Incompetence I can handle, but protocol…
-Take it easy! I swear it's Chief Mercier!

1:08:48.791 --> 1:08:51.750
I know for sure. Kevin told me.
He even called him a few times.

1:08:51.833 --> 1:08:53.541
Kevin called the chief? And then what?

1:08:53.625 --> 1:08:55.041
-He was murdered.
-Yeah.

1:08:55.125 --> 1:08:57.666
-The chief never mentioned this call.
-He didn't?

1:08:57.750 --> 1:08:59.875
-You don't think that's strange?
-No.

1:08:59.958 --> 1:09:03.083
-It is!
-The guy's a chief. He forgot. It's not--

1:09:03.166 --> 1:09:04.416
-He forgot?
-Yep.

1:09:05.125 --> 1:09:07.083
And you have a problem with poor protocol?

1:09:08.041 --> 1:09:10.666
Hey, hey, hey, hey! Wait, wait…

1:09:12.541 --> 1:09:14.708
-Sir, are you a chief?
<i>-Insh'Allah.</i>

1:09:14.791 --> 1:09:16.083
<i>Allah oma amine khoya, </i>for real.

1:09:16.166 --> 1:09:17.541
-What did you say?
-Huh?

1:09:18.041 --> 1:09:19.541
-What did you say?
-No, I thought--

1:09:19.625 --> 1:09:22.125
-You better watch yourself. Okay?
-Go on.

1:09:25.416 --> 1:09:27.833
He's a slippery little bastard, isn't he?

1:09:28.625 --> 1:09:29.458
All right…

1:09:36.666 --> 1:09:38.541
PUBLIC SECURITY

1:09:39.458 --> 1:09:41.666
You shouldn't leave
your keys in the visor.

1:09:41.750 --> 1:09:43.916
Why are you worried?
Who'd steal a car here?

1:09:44.000 --> 1:09:45.125
Well, us.

1:09:45.708 --> 1:09:49.750
If Mercier's in on it, it's out of
our jurisdiction. We're outside the law.

1:09:50.791 --> 1:09:51.708
We are the law.

1:09:57.083 --> 1:10:00.666
And here we go. Theft of a
police vehicle, and illegal surveillance.

1:10:40.500 --> 1:10:42.833
-That's a real nice place for a chief.
-Hmm.

1:10:43.791 --> 1:10:44.625
Bonuses.

1:10:46.375 --> 1:10:47.833
Right? Do chiefs get bonuses?

1:10:47.916 --> 1:10:48.833
Hmm?

1:10:50.500 --> 1:10:51.375
There you go.

1:11:01.041 --> 1:11:03.416
-Gentlemen. Afternoon.
-Aah!

1:11:04.708 --> 1:11:07.833
-Hello, Mr. Mayor.
-Hi. Mr. Mayor.

1:11:09.250 --> 1:11:11.625
I assume you both came up here
for recreation,

1:11:11.708 --> 1:11:14.375
considering you solved the case
you were sent here to investigate?

1:11:14.458 --> 1:11:16.666
Did Mercier report to you
like a good little boy?

1:11:17.250 --> 1:11:19.416
Well, Chief Mercier is a long-time friend.

1:11:19.500 --> 1:11:22.416
And it just so happens we need to discuss
the expansion of the precinct.

1:11:23.000 --> 1:11:25.041
-I don't think this concerns you.
-All right. You see?

1:11:25.125 --> 1:11:27.625
-I don't care for your tone, chief.
-Kevin Marchal.

1:11:27.708 --> 1:11:30.791
-Was he selling your militia vitamins?
-What's he talking about?

1:11:30.875 --> 1:11:32.208
Your men were pressuring him.

1:11:32.291 --> 1:11:35.041
So he called Chief Mercier,
looking for protection.

1:11:35.125 --> 1:11:37.791
But he didn't know
Chief Mercier was part of the gang.

1:11:38.416 --> 1:11:39.375
Bye-bye, Kevin.

1:11:39.458 --> 1:11:42.291
Okay, stop, Ousmane.
Excuse him, Mr. Mayor.

1:11:43.416 --> 1:11:44.250
Am I wrong?

1:11:45.125 --> 1:11:49.125
I'm sensing fury
in your voice, chief.

1:11:49.208 --> 1:11:50.083
Mmm.

1:11:50.166 --> 1:11:52.500
-Okay.
-I get it. I get it.

1:11:52.583 --> 1:11:54.250
I represent everything you hate.

1:11:55.291 --> 1:11:59.125
A man of the people, like you,
who made it, without complaining,

1:11:59.208 --> 1:12:01.250
without making excuses when he failed.

1:12:01.833 --> 1:12:03.291
Who never begged for anything.

1:12:03.375 --> 1:12:06.458
A white man. The eternal oppressor.

1:12:08.875 --> 1:12:10.375
But you know what? I really like you.

1:12:10.875 --> 1:12:14.833
And, yes, I could tell your superiors
about this rude interruption,

1:12:14.916 --> 1:12:16.833
outside your jurisdiction.

1:12:16.916 --> 1:12:20.625
I've done my research on you,
thanks to my friends at the Ministry.

1:12:21.208 --> 1:12:23.041
-Great career.
-Hmm…

1:12:23.125 --> 1:12:24.916
-Oh, yeah. Great career.
-It's okay.

1:12:25.000 --> 1:12:27.208
With a known penchant for insubordination.

1:12:27.291 --> 1:12:31.958
I have a feeling affirmative action won't
be protecting you for much longer, chief.

1:12:32.041 --> 1:12:33.208
Mm. See?

1:12:33.291 --> 1:12:35.125
Affirmative action.

1:12:36.041 --> 1:12:39.583
Oh, he, uh, charmed you, too, huh?

1:12:39.666 --> 1:12:41.833
-The great African male.
-Ah. Wow.

1:12:41.916 --> 1:12:45.500
You <i>petit bourgeois,</i>
end-of-the-line, little house cat.

1:12:46.166 --> 1:12:47.458
You like his wild side.

1:12:48.083 --> 1:12:49.166
Indomitable.

1:12:50.791 --> 1:12:52.875
He overpowers you, and you just love it.

1:12:54.333 --> 1:12:56.208
First of all, <i>"petit bourgeois…"</i>

1:12:56.291 --> 1:12:58.625
And, hey, "overpowering" me. I don't--

1:13:00.458 --> 1:13:03.125
What if I do wanna
be overpowered by a big Black guy?

1:13:03.208 --> 1:13:06.291
Huh? A brother. A Moor.
A melanated man. A swarthy fellow.

1:13:06.375 --> 1:13:07.708
-Nice one. Okay.
-No, no, no.

1:13:07.791 --> 1:13:09.708
Some things I can take,
but this is too far.

1:13:09.791 --> 1:13:12.375
What exactly don't you like?
His glistening skin?

1:13:12.458 --> 1:13:13.958
His taut muscles? His swagger?

1:13:14.041 --> 1:13:15.750
-Or that curvy booty?
-What are you--

1:13:15.833 --> 1:13:18.416
-We spent the night, and he was nervous.
-What are you doing?

1:13:18.500 --> 1:13:19.875
-Defending you.
-Cut it out!

1:13:19.958 --> 1:13:23.833
Sorry to say, you're still just
two little insignificant

1:13:23.916 --> 1:13:27.375
civil servants from Paris,
punching way above your weight, and so

1:13:28.458 --> 1:13:30.291
if you care about
the rest of your careers,

1:13:31.250 --> 1:13:34.166
get outta here
before I charge you with harassment.

1:13:34.916 --> 1:13:35.958
Friendly advice.

1:13:38.125 --> 1:13:39.375
See you soon, my friend.

1:13:39.458 --> 1:13:41.250
All right. Drive safe!

1:13:44.416 --> 1:13:46.416
-Why did you say that?
-What?

1:13:47.500 --> 1:13:48.916
-I wasn't nervous!
-Relax!

1:13:49.000 --> 1:13:51.833
I don't think so. You go first.
You checking out my ass?

1:13:57.750 --> 1:13:59.958
Where are you going now, Mercier?

1:14:01.958 --> 1:14:03.791
Are you ever
gonna let me drive?

1:14:12.083 --> 1:14:14.708
Mercier was in touch with Kevin
right before he died.

1:14:14.791 --> 1:14:16.791
They'll like that, Internal Affairs.

1:14:27.041 --> 1:14:30.000
-Too close. He'll see us.
-I know how to tail someone.

1:14:36.541 --> 1:14:38.541
Brunner will come up if we dig around.

1:14:40.291 --> 1:14:42.541
Our witnesses are a stripper and a dealer.

1:14:42.625 --> 1:14:44.291
I don't know. Against the mayor…

1:14:44.875 --> 1:14:46.708
That's why we can't lose Mercier.

1:14:47.375 --> 1:14:48.916
He's our ticket into their business.

1:14:54.750 --> 1:14:56.958
This isn't a tail.
It's a police escort.

1:15:17.833 --> 1:15:19.166
He's trying to ram us over!

1:15:20.833 --> 1:15:21.875
Push 'em off!

1:15:44.791 --> 1:15:45.750
Go on! Hit 'em!

1:15:49.416 --> 1:15:51.375
-Shit! Do something!
-What do you want me to do?

1:15:51.458 --> 1:15:52.666
I don't know! Where's your gun?

1:15:52.750 --> 1:15:53.833
Oh, yeah.

1:16:01.041 --> 1:16:01.875
Shit!

1:16:05.000 --> 1:16:06.333
Stop swerving!

1:16:16.958 --> 1:16:18.458
-Is he still there?
-Yeah.

1:16:18.541 --> 1:16:19.750
'Cause you're driving.

1:16:21.583 --> 1:16:22.500
Shit.

1:16:25.875 --> 1:16:27.416
-Speed up!
-I am!

1:16:27.500 --> 1:16:30.375
This is a cop car! Not exactly a Ferrari!

1:16:34.250 --> 1:16:35.083
Bastards.

1:16:37.291 --> 1:16:38.291
Do Ferraris have these?

1:16:42.416 --> 1:16:43.416
Do it! One…

1:16:44.875 --> 1:16:46.375
Two… Three!

1:16:48.000 --> 1:16:49.250
Shit! Fuck! Shit!

1:16:50.416 --> 1:16:52.583
Stop the fucking car!

1:17:16.708 --> 1:17:18.208
-Okay?
-Yeah. You?

1:17:18.291 --> 1:17:19.458
Yeah, I'm fine.

1:17:20.875 --> 1:17:22.541
I think I'm fine.

1:17:36.958 --> 1:17:40.041
<i>-Hey, Ous. What's up?</i>
-Hey, Yas. You got something?

1:17:40.125 --> 1:17:42.208
-Yeah, I spoke to my guys at the lab.
<i>-And?</i>

1:17:42.291 --> 1:17:44.291
The methamphetamine you found
is called Pervitin.

1:17:44.375 --> 1:17:46.125
The Nazis used it during the war.

1:17:46.208 --> 1:17:47.333
-You're kidding.
<i>-No.</i>

1:17:47.416 --> 1:17:48.750
<i>To keep guys from getting hooked,</i>

1:17:48.833 --> 1:17:51.625
they laced it with other crap,
um, cocaine, oxycodone.

1:17:51.708 --> 1:17:52.916
Which makes D-IX.

1:17:53.000 --> 1:17:54.750
<i>-On that stuff, you don't feel anything.</i>
-Oh!

1:17:54.833 --> 1:17:57.333
Anyway, that's what
that guy's test results said.

1:17:57.416 --> 1:17:59.208
Not sure what you're up to,
but be careful.

1:17:59.291 --> 1:18:00.541
<i>Hey, Yas!</i>

1:18:00.625 --> 1:18:01.625
It's François.

1:18:01.708 --> 1:18:03.166
<i>-Uh… Uh…</i>
-Wh…

1:18:03.250 --> 1:18:05.333
-François Monge.
<i>-You're with Monge?</i>

1:18:05.416 --> 1:18:06.916
-I'll explain later.
-How are you?

1:18:07.000 --> 1:18:08.625
<i>I'm good. I'm good, but…</i>

1:18:08.708 --> 1:18:10.833
-And-- What? It's a free country.
-Stop it. You said hi.

1:18:10.916 --> 1:18:13.458
-I'm having a conversation. Shut up. Go.
-Well, yeah… Okay, fine.

1:18:13.541 --> 1:18:15.416
I'm sorry. I'll explain later.

1:18:15.500 --> 1:18:17.375
<i>-Thanks, Yas.</i>
-See you guys later.

1:18:17.458 --> 1:18:18.500
God!

1:18:19.916 --> 1:18:22.125
Hey, you were right.
It's not just a few fascists.

1:18:22.208 --> 1:18:24.791
No. It's a fucking army.

1:18:37.208 --> 1:18:39.458
-What the hell? Who does this?
-It's just us.

1:18:39.541 --> 1:18:40.916
We can explain.

1:18:41.000 --> 1:18:42.666
Told you we should've turned the lamp on.

1:18:42.750 --> 1:18:44.166
-Sorry. Yeah.
-You should be.

1:18:44.250 --> 1:18:46.375
-Did we scare you?
-Yeah. A little bit.

1:18:47.625 --> 1:18:49.750
-We need to talk.
-Hmm.

1:18:49.833 --> 1:18:52.875
The real question isn't who, but why.
Why is Brunner doing this?

1:18:52.958 --> 1:18:55.958
He's got his drugged-up army.
He runs the neighborhoods.

1:18:56.041 --> 1:18:58.500
-He kills people who know too much. Kevin.
-Or us.

1:18:58.583 --> 1:19:01.625
-You don't do all that for law and order.
-That's why he was elected.

1:19:01.708 --> 1:19:03.916
Either way, we'd better find out fast.

1:19:04.000 --> 1:19:07.166
We're not gonna crack this tonight.
I'll pull out the couch for you guys.

1:19:07.250 --> 1:19:09.250
-You don't mind sharing a bed?
-Not at all.

1:19:09.833 --> 1:19:11.333
We're used to it.

1:19:16.250 --> 1:19:17.291
This is gonna sound weird,

1:19:17.375 --> 1:19:20.041
but you know what I was thinking
when we were in the car?

1:19:20.125 --> 1:19:23.208
"Wow, it's been a long time
since I've felt so at home like this."

1:19:23.291 --> 1:19:24.750
And it was with you.

1:19:27.791 --> 1:19:30.125
Also, I wanted to apologize about Yasmine.

1:19:30.208 --> 1:19:31.541
Oh, it's all right.

1:19:31.625 --> 1:19:32.791
No, you were right.

1:19:33.666 --> 1:19:35.500
I was jealous of you. Your success.

1:19:35.583 --> 1:19:38.333
I tried to get revenge
the only way I knew how.

1:19:39.541 --> 1:19:41.541
I'm not proud of it. I apologize.

1:19:47.083 --> 1:19:47.916
Okay.

1:19:58.375 --> 1:19:59.666
Is that all you wanna say?

1:20:01.291 --> 1:20:02.125
Yeah, uh…

1:20:02.208 --> 1:20:04.625
Did you wanna say you're sorry,
for example?

1:20:05.333 --> 1:20:07.875
-Sorry for what?
-You tell me.

1:20:07.958 --> 1:20:10.208
You're a pain in the ass.

1:20:12.708 --> 1:20:14.875
Okay, fine. I'm sorry too. There.

1:20:14.958 --> 1:20:16.125
-Yeah?
-Okay?

1:20:16.208 --> 1:20:17.500
Hm. What for?

1:20:21.500 --> 1:20:23.000
For the chief of police exam.

1:20:23.083 --> 1:20:25.041
-Hmm.
-You were right. I snubbed you.

1:20:25.791 --> 1:20:26.833
I was mad about Yasmine.

1:20:28.833 --> 1:20:32.083
Now that you've said it,
I might be able to forgive you some day.

1:20:33.541 --> 1:20:34.833
We're making progress.

1:20:35.875 --> 1:20:36.958
This is cool.

1:20:37.833 --> 1:20:40.625
You know what I'm thinking?

1:20:40.708 --> 1:20:43.583
For all we know, I keep failing
the police chief's exam over and over

1:20:43.666 --> 1:20:44.750
just to piss off my dad.

1:20:45.875 --> 1:20:46.791
Hmm?

1:20:47.666 --> 1:20:50.083
I mean, you passed. It can't be that hard.

1:20:51.583 --> 1:20:53.833
I'm gonna pretend I didn't hear that.
Okay?

1:20:53.916 --> 1:20:56.041
Yeah, you're right.
That's pseudo-psychology.

1:20:57.791 --> 1:20:59.875
Also, you can have Alice.
I'm officially dropping out.

1:20:59.958 --> 1:21:02.916
Dropping out of what?
You think I need your permission?

1:21:03.000 --> 1:21:04.291
come on.

1:21:05.541 --> 1:21:06.958
Good night, boys.

1:21:08.375 --> 1:21:10.958
-Shit. She got some thin walls.
-Man.

1:21:11.750 --> 1:21:12.875
Good night.

1:21:22.958 --> 1:21:25.750
François. Underwear on.

1:21:32.541 --> 1:21:34.500
It's amazing
how much we have in common.

1:21:34.583 --> 1:21:36.291
We eat the same thing in the morning.

1:21:36.375 --> 1:21:38.250
-Amazing. I mean…
-Isn't it?

1:21:38.333 --> 1:21:40.083
-Not just strawberries and honey.
-No!

1:21:40.166 --> 1:21:42.333
-Dordogne strawberries with Acacia.
-Dordogne…

1:21:42.416 --> 1:21:44.500
-Are you into astrology?
-What time is it?

1:21:46.458 --> 1:21:48.291
-Why didn't you wake me up?
-You were sleeping.

1:21:48.375 --> 1:21:50.375
So you only wake people up
if they're not sleeping?

1:21:51.750 --> 1:21:53.750
-Sorry. How are you?
-Oh, I'm… great.

1:21:54.250 --> 1:21:56.250
I was chatting with François.

1:21:56.333 --> 1:21:58.000
-About?
-What we should do now.

1:21:58.583 --> 1:22:00.083
We can't go after Brunner directly.

1:22:00.166 --> 1:22:02.375
-Too risky. We find a weakness.
-Here's the plan.

1:22:02.458 --> 1:22:03.666
You stay here where it's safe.

1:22:03.750 --> 1:22:06.375
I go to the station
and get all the files we have on him.

1:22:06.458 --> 1:22:09.625
-Then we go through everything together.
-Okay, yeah. Let's do that.

1:22:09.708 --> 1:22:11.083
-Really?
-Yeah.

1:22:11.166 --> 1:22:13.458
You'd rather put your head to work
than your legs.

1:22:14.083 --> 1:22:16.041
I'm gonna shower.

1:22:21.666 --> 1:22:23.500
See? I don't need permission either.

1:22:26.375 --> 1:22:29.541
I'm shocked.
I didn't think she was that easy.

1:22:32.041 --> 1:22:33.750
Wanna get out of here?

1:22:33.833 --> 1:22:34.916
What for?

1:22:35.000 --> 1:22:37.541
The guy's preparing for war.
Don't you wanna know against who?

1:22:38.500 --> 1:22:39.958
You'd rather stay and eat crackers?

1:22:41.208 --> 1:22:43.250
Oh, okay.. That's what I was thinking.

1:22:44.375 --> 1:22:46.416
-And Alice?
-Too dangerous. You're right.

1:22:46.500 --> 1:22:47.833
Let's head out. Come on.

1:23:01.833 --> 1:23:04.166
So, let's recap. Disobeying protocol.

1:23:04.250 --> 1:23:06.208
We're trying to return to protocol.

1:23:06.291 --> 1:23:08.833
-Stealing a police vehicle.
-We are police.

1:23:08.916 --> 1:23:10.333
Breaking and entering.

1:23:10.416 --> 1:23:12.000
Uh, guess you're right.

1:23:21.833 --> 1:23:24.333
Oh shit!

1:23:31.458 --> 1:23:32.750
Aussaresses!

1:23:35.125 --> 1:23:35.958
There!

1:23:38.666 --> 1:23:40.458
Aussaresses, shut up!

1:23:43.916 --> 1:23:46.083
This dog is driving me crazy.

1:23:46.166 --> 1:23:48.666
Ugh. You're supposed to stay outside.

1:23:50.083 --> 1:23:52.250
You don't like it,
take it up with your father.

1:24:02.666 --> 1:24:04.625
-I got upstairs, you got downstairs.
-Why?

1:24:04.708 --> 1:24:06.500
-Because.
-Why not the reverse?

1:24:07.166 --> 1:24:09.708
-'Cause I'm right here.
-I checked down there. There's nothing.

1:24:09.791 --> 1:24:11.875
-Not down here, down there.
-"Dow-ear"?

1:24:11.958 --> 1:24:14.000
-Down there!
-I don't speak African.

1:24:15.041 --> 1:24:16.041
Go over there!

1:25:30.250 --> 1:25:33.208
Ugh, Natalia,
I'm so sick of this dog.

1:25:33.291 --> 1:25:34.750
I'm gonna put him down.

1:25:34.833 --> 1:25:37.041
-I hate that dog.
-Hey, sweetie?

1:25:39.416 --> 1:25:41.125
Your piano teacher's on the way.

1:25:41.208 --> 1:25:42.708
Go practice your scales.

1:25:43.583 --> 1:25:45.166
Psst. Psst!

1:25:56.333 --> 1:25:58.208
I don't understand.

1:25:58.291 --> 1:26:00.875
-Oh man.
-Speak. Speak with your mouth.

1:26:03.416 --> 1:26:04.708
-Press unmute.
-Sorry.

1:26:04.791 --> 1:26:08.208
You go that way, I go that way.
And by the end, we meet up here.

1:26:08.291 --> 1:26:09.291
What floor are you on?

1:26:10.625 --> 1:26:13.833
-Um… From where?
-I don't know! Where you came from.

1:26:15.208 --> 1:26:17.291
Well, there's one floor below
and two above.

1:26:17.375 --> 1:26:20.083
One below you,
one above me from the bottom.

1:26:20.166 --> 1:26:23.083
Right. I see three floors below,
but two above. See you soon.

1:26:50.500 --> 1:26:52.500
-How'd you get here?
-There's another door.

1:26:52.583 --> 1:26:53.791
-Okay, so?
-Nothing.

1:26:53.875 --> 1:26:54.875
-You?
-Nothing.

1:26:54.958 --> 1:26:56.625
We missed something.

1:26:59.375 --> 1:27:00.875
-Shit. Brunner.
-What about him?

1:27:00.958 --> 1:27:02.083
His stick.

1:27:02.166 --> 1:27:04.291
-You didn't see his stick?
-Why would I notice that?

1:27:04.375 --> 1:27:05.916
-It was in your face.
-What the fuck?

1:27:06.000 --> 1:27:08.958
-It was in his hand!
-My God. You are disgusting.

1:27:10.083 --> 1:27:11.666
If there's a stick, there's a table.

1:27:11.750 --> 1:27:14.416
If there's a pool table,
there's a billiard room. We missed it!

1:27:15.625 --> 1:27:17.791
Hey, not bad. All right, nice one.

1:27:24.875 --> 1:27:26.500
-François?
-What?

1:27:26.583 --> 1:27:27.583
What are you doing?

1:27:28.166 --> 1:27:29.000
Coming.

1:27:29.500 --> 1:27:30.375
I can see you.

1:27:30.458 --> 1:27:31.291
Yeah.

1:27:33.875 --> 1:27:34.791
Ah.

1:27:45.250 --> 1:27:46.125
Hey. Psst.

1:28:00.791 --> 1:28:01.875
Of course.

1:28:02.750 --> 1:28:05.250
-Of course the guy has a man cave.
-What for?

1:28:05.333 --> 1:28:08.041
Well, you know, his own space
to decompress in privacy.

1:28:09.875 --> 1:28:12.416
A guy with taste like this
can't be all bad, right?

1:28:13.125 --> 1:28:13.958
A mosque.

1:28:14.958 --> 1:28:17.208
A hookah lounge. A synagogue.

1:28:18.083 --> 1:28:19.375
An immigrant center.

1:28:21.375 --> 1:28:23.583
It's all there. The start time.

1:28:24.458 --> 1:28:26.458
The location, the target…

1:28:26.541 --> 1:28:28.916
This is what Kevin Marchal discovered.

1:28:29.416 --> 1:28:31.166
The grand plan that scared him.

1:28:32.916 --> 1:28:34.333
Coordinated attacks.

1:28:37.166 --> 1:28:38.958
Looks like it kicks off at 5:00 p.m.

1:28:39.458 --> 1:28:40.291
What day?

1:28:46.625 --> 1:28:49.416
Alice. Sorry we rushed out,
but it's worse than we thought.

1:28:49.500 --> 1:28:53.166
Get all the backup you can and meet us
right away at Lefranc's print shop.

1:28:53.250 --> 1:28:54.500
All right, I got it.

1:28:54.583 --> 1:28:57.875
Except I can't send her GPS coordinates
because she wouldn't give me her number.

1:28:57.958 --> 1:29:01.166
I can't explain right now.
I'm sending you GPS coordinates.

1:29:01.250 --> 1:29:03.083
-Kisses.
-"Kisses"?

1:29:04.166 --> 1:29:05.000
It slipped out.

1:29:19.375 --> 1:29:20.333
This is the place.

1:29:27.666 --> 1:29:29.041
Thanks.

1:29:30.041 --> 1:29:31.000
How considerate.

1:30:01.125 --> 1:30:04.250
The time has finally come, my friends!

1:30:04.333 --> 1:30:05.708
-Yeah!
-My brothers!

1:30:07.500 --> 1:30:12.041
To begin a new page in the great book
of our shared history.

1:30:12.125 --> 1:30:16.500
The time has finally come
for the birth of a new world order!

1:30:16.583 --> 1:30:17.583
Yeah!

1:30:17.666 --> 1:30:20.041
A world where we will no longer be afraid.

1:30:20.125 --> 1:30:21.666
-Finally.
-Mmm.

1:30:21.750 --> 1:30:26.041
Because fear and shame
belong to our enemies alone!

1:30:31.458 --> 1:30:34.208
But I know you are just
a different breed of men!

1:30:34.291 --> 1:30:36.500
You are not monsters!

1:30:36.583 --> 1:30:39.000
-No!
-You are the resistance!

1:30:39.083 --> 1:30:40.250
Heroes!

1:30:40.333 --> 1:30:41.666
-Yeah!
-We're together!

1:30:41.750 --> 1:30:43.541
And with me, you are never alone!

1:30:43.625 --> 1:30:44.625
No! Never!

1:30:44.708 --> 1:30:47.541
All our friends in Europe,
and in New Zealand,

1:30:47.625 --> 1:30:50.083
Russia, the United States,

1:30:50.166 --> 1:30:52.916
they all want the same thing we do!

1:30:53.000 --> 1:30:55.833
-All of them!
-Autonomy! And resistance!

1:30:55.916 --> 1:30:56.791
Yeah!

1:30:58.625 --> 1:30:59.750
However…

1:31:01.208 --> 1:31:02.708
resistance

1:31:04.000 --> 1:31:05.833
is just not enough.

1:31:05.916 --> 1:31:07.541
-No!
-It's time to attack.

1:31:07.625 --> 1:31:09.166
Yeah!

1:31:11.625 --> 1:31:16.041
A single spark can set the world on fire
and show us what's really possible.

1:31:16.125 --> 1:31:18.375
-Right!
-As of now, you are the spark!

1:31:21.875 --> 1:31:24.041
In a few hours,
every news outlet

1:31:24.125 --> 1:31:28.625
will realize
an incontestable, glorious truth.

1:31:29.208 --> 1:31:31.291
This country belongs to us!

1:31:31.375 --> 1:31:32.291
Yes!

1:31:32.375 --> 1:31:34.541
-We will fight to the end…
-Bravo!

1:31:34.625 --> 1:31:36.166
-…to win it back.
-There are tons of 'em.

1:31:36.250 --> 1:31:37.375
We can't arrest everyone.

1:31:37.458 --> 1:31:40.875
No, not if they leave.
We have to keep 'em here.

1:31:41.875 --> 1:31:43.708
Shit. No service.

1:32:10.833 --> 1:32:13.958
Okay, I'll figure it out.
Just make sure they all stay inside.

1:32:14.958 --> 1:32:16.666
-Why me?
-Just because.

1:32:16.750 --> 1:32:19.708
-Because what?
-I don't look like I play for their team.

1:32:19.791 --> 1:32:21.541
So what? I look like a fascist to you?

1:32:21.625 --> 1:32:24.166
-No! But you're not Black.
-I'm not Black?

1:32:24.250 --> 1:32:25.625
-Are you?
-No.

1:32:25.708 --> 1:32:27.833
-No. Okay?
-Okay. You're playing that card.

1:32:27.916 --> 1:32:30.041
-What, the facts card?
-It's fine, I'll do it.

1:32:30.125 --> 1:32:31.833
-You're not Black!
-I'll do it alone.

1:32:31.916 --> 1:32:32.833
You'll do what alone?

1:32:34.750 --> 1:32:35.916
It's that way.

1:32:36.000 --> 1:32:37.666
I know. I'm not going
in there empty-handed.

1:32:37.750 --> 1:32:39.875
So I'm gonna have to improvise.

1:32:42.666 --> 1:32:45.833
All right, if this goes south,
the code word is your name. Okay?

1:32:45.916 --> 1:32:47.333
-"Yorname"?
-Yeah.

1:32:47.416 --> 1:32:50.083
That's a weird code word.
Shouldn't it be simpler?

1:32:50.166 --> 1:32:52.583
No, it's your name.
Your actual name. Ousmane.

1:32:53.208 --> 1:32:55.458
Okay, so if it's my name,
you're addressing me.

1:32:55.541 --> 1:32:57.208
-That's not a code word.
-Yeah, sure it is.

1:32:57.291 --> 1:33:00.375
-But, no--
-I chose it. I know it's a code word.

1:33:00.458 --> 1:33:01.916
-If you say "Ousmane"…
-Yeah?

1:33:02.000 --> 1:33:04.083
-…you're just saying my name.
-Okay, it's fine.

1:33:04.166 --> 1:33:06.416
-But--
-I thought I'd do something nice for you.

1:33:06.500 --> 1:33:09.000
-I thought you'd be touched. It's fine.
-Oh, you want a thank you?

1:33:09.083 --> 1:33:11.125
-No, why would I?
-You thought I'd be touched?

1:33:11.208 --> 1:33:13.375
Okay, thank you, François. Thank you.

1:33:13.458 --> 1:33:14.500
All right.

1:33:15.125 --> 1:33:16.791
Okay, then. Goodbye.

1:33:16.875 --> 1:33:18.541
-Or farewell.
-Farewell?

1:33:19.375 --> 1:33:21.416
Stop it. It's gonna be fine, okay?

1:33:21.500 --> 1:33:22.875
I'm here.

1:33:45.625 --> 1:33:49.333
-What's this shithead doing here?
-Encore! Encore! Encore! Encore!

1:33:50.208 --> 1:33:53.166
Bravo, madam. Nice vibrato.
Can you do "Free Bird" next?

1:34:03.541 --> 1:34:06.250
Captain Monge, there's being stubborn
and there's being stupid.

1:34:06.333 --> 1:34:08.458
-Oh, yeah?
-Did your boyfriend drop you off?

1:34:08.541 --> 1:34:10.500
We broke up. That's right. I left him.

1:34:10.583 --> 1:34:11.583
I've been thinking…

1:34:11.666 --> 1:34:15.458
Yeah, yeah. No, I think that I'm really
one of you. I belong right here.

1:34:15.541 --> 1:34:18.833
So, what's the next step?
Is there some kind of test?

1:34:18.916 --> 1:34:20.250
Psychological screening?

1:34:20.875 --> 1:34:22.833
No, not psychological, no. Physical?

1:34:27.250 --> 1:34:29.583
And I'm pretty well off. I'm white.

1:34:29.666 --> 1:34:31.666
I'm baptized. Does that matter to you?

1:34:32.416 --> 1:34:35.416
Bonus points, right?
I assume being Catholic is a plus?

1:34:40.208 --> 1:34:42.041
I detest everyone outside our border.

1:34:42.125 --> 1:34:44.625
Um, Africans, Asians, Arabs.

1:34:44.708 --> 1:34:48.083
-Except for their food. I mean, shawarma--
-All right. That's enough.

1:34:50.125 --> 1:34:52.875
One more step, I blow the place up, okay?

1:34:53.583 --> 1:34:54.791
Put it down. Put it down.

1:34:54.875 --> 1:34:57.458
-What the hell is that?
-Easy. Easy, man.

1:35:01.666 --> 1:35:02.500
Hey!

1:35:03.375 --> 1:35:04.875
-Are you alone?
-Yes. François?

1:35:05.458 --> 1:35:07.625
Inside. Let's finish this, and then we…

1:35:08.583 --> 1:35:10.041
-Easy.
-What are you doing?

1:35:10.125 --> 1:35:12.583
Why didn't you just leave?
It would have been so much simpler.

1:35:12.666 --> 1:35:15.000
-Did they threaten you?
-You think they're the bad guys?

1:35:16.458 --> 1:35:18.291
-This isn't you.
-No, it isn't me.

1:35:18.916 --> 1:35:21.875
Not sweet little Alice
that's into the big Paris cop.

1:35:22.375 --> 1:35:24.625
Huh? The nice girl who's always
got a smile?

1:35:25.625 --> 1:35:26.833
You really don't get it.

1:35:26.916 --> 1:35:29.083
We're not gonna change anything
with some extra patrols

1:35:29.166 --> 1:35:30.750
and soccer games with the local kids.

1:35:30.833 --> 1:35:32.791
Brunner's right. We have to start over.

1:35:32.875 --> 1:35:34.791
-Blank state.
-By killing innocent people?

1:35:34.875 --> 1:35:36.750
Yeah. Let's go.

1:35:36.833 --> 1:35:39.041
Now we're calm. Okay?

1:35:39.708 --> 1:35:41.416
Get out of here! Right now!

1:35:41.500 --> 1:35:43.833
-Go home, you traitor!
-Ma'am. Ma'am.

1:35:43.916 --> 1:35:45.000
-Give it to me!
-Ma'am.

1:35:45.083 --> 1:35:46.166
Careful!

1:35:46.250 --> 1:35:48.166
-Try not to damage your voice!
-Give me that!

1:35:48.250 --> 1:35:49.916
Guess you really fooled me, Alice.

1:35:50.000 --> 1:35:52.916
No, you did this to yourself.
I just said what you wanted to hear.

1:35:59.041 --> 1:36:00.750
Let me guess. You don't hit girls?

1:36:11.708 --> 1:36:13.416
We'll blow up because of your girlfriend!

1:36:13.500 --> 1:36:15.333
We're gonna blow up because of you, ma'am.

1:36:15.416 --> 1:36:17.333
Hey, hey, hey. No, no. Hey, hey. Now what?

1:36:21.541 --> 1:36:23.083
Hey… Hey, hey! Hey, hey!

1:36:23.166 --> 1:36:24.041
Hey!

1:36:25.541 --> 1:36:27.833
Ousmane! Oh-oh-oh! Stay back, okay?

1:36:27.916 --> 1:36:28.833
Hey, hey, hey!

1:36:37.750 --> 1:36:40.083
You can't stop the course of history!

1:36:40.166 --> 1:36:41.583
-You're nothing!
-Okay.

1:36:41.666 --> 1:36:44.583
Hey! I'm willing
to die for the cause, but not here, okay?

1:36:44.666 --> 1:36:46.250
Send me to a mosque or a KFC. Not here.

1:36:46.333 --> 1:36:49.416
I'm not dying in some abandoned
print shop. Ous-- Ousmane!

1:36:50.916 --> 1:36:52.500
-Ousmane!
-That's for me.

1:36:56.333 --> 1:36:57.625
We're not done yet.

1:37:00.416 --> 1:37:02.625
Ousmane!

1:37:06.625 --> 1:37:07.875
Ousmane!

1:37:08.375 --> 1:37:10.916
Ousmane! Ousmane!

1:37:12.041 --> 1:37:14.041
"Yorname"!

1:37:52.833 --> 1:37:53.791
Out of the way!

1:38:15.500 --> 1:38:16.500
Get in.

1:38:32.541 --> 1:38:33.833
-Bullshi-- Oh!
-March!

1:38:35.291 --> 1:38:37.916
Stop! Let me in, you savage!

1:38:38.000 --> 1:38:41.458
After everything we've done for you!
Go back where you came from!

1:38:41.541 --> 1:38:44.500
-Get off! This ain't Uber, lady!
-Terrorist!

1:38:46.000 --> 1:38:49.541
-You're gonna break a hip, woman! Stop it!
-Terrorist!

1:38:55.916 --> 1:38:57.958
Are you nuts?
Shit, they're all over the place!

1:38:58.041 --> 1:39:00.750
This is your stop. <i>Bon voyage!</i>

1:39:16.708 --> 1:39:18.833
Hurry up! Get in.
Come on, come on, come on!

1:39:20.375 --> 1:39:22.000
-Where'd he go?
-I don't know.

1:39:22.083 --> 1:39:24.208
-You didn't see him?
-No. I don't know…

1:39:24.291 --> 1:39:25.666
I was trying to defend myself!

1:39:30.333 --> 1:39:31.500
That way.

1:39:37.041 --> 1:39:38.416
Okay. We'll get him now.

1:39:43.125 --> 1:39:43.958
Gah!

1:39:45.375 --> 1:39:46.291
Come on.

1:39:47.541 --> 1:39:49.250
-You see him?
-No.

1:39:55.541 --> 1:39:57.083
-What was that?
-I don't know.

1:40:02.958 --> 1:40:03.791
Oh shit!

1:40:11.750 --> 1:40:13.208
Where is he? Where?

1:40:14.958 --> 1:40:16.625
Yes!

1:40:20.250 --> 1:40:21.666
-Aah!
-Over here!

1:40:33.916 --> 1:40:35.250
-Is he there?
-There!

1:40:37.583 --> 1:40:39.750
Come on! Get him off! Do something!

1:40:40.333 --> 1:40:43.500
I can't see him! I don't know
where he is. You look, I'll drive!

1:40:53.958 --> 1:40:55.125
God damn!

1:40:55.208 --> 1:40:56.833
Oh no… Shit!

1:41:28.041 --> 1:41:30.041
-Where's Alice?
-With Brunner.

1:41:30.125 --> 1:41:32.458
-What?
-Yeah. I'll explain later.

1:41:38.583 --> 1:41:39.666
Do you see them?

1:41:40.333 --> 1:41:41.416
No. We're good.

1:41:41.500 --> 1:41:42.791
We're almost there.

1:41:46.416 --> 1:41:48.083
I knew there was something wrong with her.

1:41:48.583 --> 1:41:49.583
I don't see 'em.

1:41:51.208 --> 1:41:52.291
SWITZERLAND

1:41:55.708 --> 1:41:58.125
No. Go to point zero.

1:42:06.250 --> 1:42:09.416
Switzerland!
They're going to Switzerland. Right there!

1:42:27.208 --> 1:42:28.625
That's them.

1:42:29.208 --> 1:42:30.750
-You wearing your seat belt?
-No.

1:42:30.833 --> 1:42:31.666
Buckle up.

1:42:32.208 --> 1:42:34.041
-Why?
-Buckle up.

1:42:37.541 --> 1:42:38.875
I think it's stuck.

1:42:47.708 --> 1:42:49.083
Come on!

1:43:12.000 --> 1:43:14.208
-There!
-They're here!

1:43:14.291 --> 1:43:16.125
Look out! Watch out!

1:43:17.833 --> 1:43:19.375
Look out!

1:43:34.333 --> 1:43:36.458
It's okay. We lost 'em. Speed up.

1:43:43.458 --> 1:43:44.666
There!

1:44:02.791 --> 1:44:05.250
Shit! They're coming down the mountain.
Come on!

1:44:15.625 --> 1:44:17.916
-They're getting closer! Drive faster!
-Shut up!

1:44:20.833 --> 1:44:23.250
Sheep, sheep,
sheep, sheep, sheep!

1:44:24.833 --> 1:44:26.833
-Out the way, assholes!
-They're everywhere.

1:44:26.916 --> 1:44:28.875
Who let the sheep out?

1:44:30.708 --> 1:44:32.458
They're coming! They're coming! Hurry!

1:44:33.541 --> 1:44:36.041
Look out! Hey, hey, hey!

1:44:41.166 --> 1:44:43.000
Look out!

1:44:45.291 --> 1:44:46.541
Whoa! Right there!

1:44:48.291 --> 1:44:49.541
Look out…

1:45:17.875 --> 1:45:18.916
Mmm.

1:45:21.458 --> 1:45:22.708
Come on. Do it.

1:45:22.791 --> 1:45:24.125
NO CONNECTION

1:45:26.416 --> 1:45:28.500
What are you doing, Ousmane?
What are you doing?

1:45:45.541 --> 1:45:47.000
-You okay?
-You insane?

1:45:51.583 --> 1:45:53.958
-What else could I do?
-Anything but that.

1:46:06.791 --> 1:46:08.125
I'll call an ambulance, okay?

1:46:08.208 --> 1:46:09.375
-Okay…
-Don't worry.

1:46:10.666 --> 1:46:12.208
Out of the way!

1:46:19.541 --> 1:46:20.791
Ousmane!

1:46:21.500 --> 1:46:22.583
He's there!

1:46:29.333 --> 1:46:31.666
STARTING COUNTDOWN

1:46:34.500 --> 1:46:36.625
It's done! Just one spark,

1:46:37.333 --> 1:46:38.250
and everything burns!

1:46:38.333 --> 1:46:40.541
ARMED

1:46:41.500 --> 1:46:42.833
We have three minutes!

1:46:46.666 --> 1:46:48.875
-Police!
-Everybody out!

1:46:48.958 --> 1:46:50.791
-Go! Go!
-Come on! Get out!

1:46:50.875 --> 1:46:52.666
There's a bomb! Out!
Get outta here, come on!

1:46:58.125 --> 1:47:00.416
-Out! Get out! Come on!
-Come on! We have to go!

1:47:00.500 --> 1:47:02.125
-Get out! Get out!
-Hey! Hey!

1:47:02.208 --> 1:47:03.458
-What's going on?
-Go!

1:47:07.791 --> 1:47:09.333
Get out! Come on, come on!

1:47:09.416 --> 1:47:11.666
-Come on! Get out!
-Everyone outside! There's a bomb!

1:47:11.750 --> 1:47:13.791
There's a bomb!
How do you say "bomb" in African?

1:47:13.875 --> 1:47:16.125
-African?
-South, north. Any African.

1:47:16.208 --> 1:47:19.166
-I'mma check the upper floors.
-Don't! I'll sacrifice myself.

1:47:19.250 --> 1:47:22.166
It won't erase centuries of suffering
my ancestors inflicted--

1:47:22.250 --> 1:47:24.541
-You think this is the time?
-When is it ever the time?

1:47:28.083 --> 1:47:29.791
This way!

1:47:39.083 --> 1:47:40.875
You can't stay here!
There's a bomb.

1:47:40.958 --> 1:47:43.083
Move! Move, please!
Leave the building, please.

1:47:43.166 --> 1:47:45.666
There's a bomb.
Everybody leave the building, please!

1:47:46.166 --> 1:47:47.666
Come on! Get the kids! Hurry up!

1:47:50.083 --> 1:47:51.916
Come on, hurry up, guys.
Get out, get out!

1:47:52.000 --> 1:47:54.750
-Let's go! Come on! Go, go, go!
-A bomb! Hurry!

1:47:54.833 --> 1:47:56.750
-Come on! Hurry! Hey!
-Hey, hey, come on!

1:47:57.541 --> 1:48:00.000
Come on!
Come on, this way! There's a bomb!

1:48:00.916 --> 1:48:03.083
-Get out! Bomb!
-Get out, get out!

1:48:05.625 --> 1:48:08.625
Everybody, leave the building, please.
Out, out! Everybody out!

1:48:08.708 --> 1:48:11.166
Get out, guys. Come on!
We got a bomb! Go on, go!

1:48:22.958 --> 1:48:25.875
-Okay. All good.
-Twenty seconds. We're not gonna make it.

1:48:26.750 --> 1:48:29.583
-There. Look!
-No way! That's 60 feet!

1:48:29.666 --> 1:48:31.791
We have to try. Come on! Let's go.

1:48:31.875 --> 1:48:32.958
Run!

1:48:54.208 --> 1:48:55.708
I don't wanna die like this.

1:48:55.791 --> 1:48:57.666
-Not like this, with you!
-What?

1:49:28.083 --> 1:49:29.291
Huh?

1:49:48.500 --> 1:49:49.333
Hey.

1:49:55.166 --> 1:49:56.375
Oh, sorry!

1:49:56.458 --> 1:49:57.875
I'm sorry.

1:49:57.958 --> 1:49:59.375
Sorry.

1:50:00.541 --> 1:50:01.375
Bastard.

1:50:02.041 --> 1:50:03.958
Guess the Sons of Clovis
need a new <i>Führer.</i>

1:50:04.041 --> 1:50:05.250
Come on.

1:50:05.958 --> 1:50:07.041
Or a <i>Führesse.</i>

1:50:09.166 --> 1:50:12.291
That's right.
<i>Führesse,</i> is that a thing?

1:50:12.375 --> 1:50:14.166
<i>Fü-- Führina?</i>

1:50:14.666 --> 1:50:18.208
-Yeah, <i>Führina's </i>good. <i>Führette?</i>
-<i>Führette?</i> Sounds like a rodent.

1:50:18.291 --> 1:50:20.250
Yeah, <i>Führina's </i>better. Cool.

1:50:38.208 --> 1:50:40.916
-What do we tell the higher-ups?
-No idea.

1:50:41.583 --> 1:50:44.458
The case was closed,
so we decided to tour the area.

1:50:44.541 --> 1:50:47.416
Right. When suddenly,
a speeding vehicle blocked our path.

1:50:47.500 --> 1:50:49.916
-Right.
-And then, the call of duty…

1:50:50.416 --> 1:50:53.208
Is stronger than the call of the wild…

1:50:53.291 --> 1:50:55.208
-Right.
-I say we answer.

1:50:55.708 --> 1:50:57.083
This way.

1:51:16.541 --> 1:51:17.708
You okay?

1:51:21.416 --> 1:51:22.916
<i>In a shocking development,</i>

1:51:23.000 --> 1:51:25.833
<i>Antoine Brunner,</i>
<i>leader of the France Vive Party,</i>

1:51:25.916 --> 1:51:29.458
<i>has been indicted for ties</i>
<i>to a domestic terrorist organization.</i>

1:51:29.541 --> 1:51:32.125
<i>Two brave police officers from Paris</i>

1:51:32.208 --> 1:51:35.375
<i>are responsible for foiling</i>
<i>their final plot.</i>

1:51:35.458 --> 1:51:38.750
<i>Once again, our police force</i>
<i>has worked tirelessly</i>

1:51:38.833 --> 1:51:40.958
<i>to preserve the safety</i>
<i>of all of our citizens.</i>

1:51:41.041 --> 1:51:44.541
<i>I'm especially grateful for the brave men</i>
<i>and women of the Paris Criminal Division,</i>

1:51:44.625 --> 1:51:46.583
<i>and I'm honored to serve as their leader.</i>

1:51:46.666 --> 1:51:48.958
<i>I'd also like to thank</i>
<i>our Minister of the Interior,</i>

1:51:49.041 --> 1:51:50.875
<i>who has contacted me several times…</i>

1:51:50.958 --> 1:51:53.083
They only interview people
who sit at a desk.

1:51:53.708 --> 1:51:55.583
What's the point,
if no one sees what we do?

1:51:55.666 --> 1:51:56.791
It's frustrating.

1:51:58.750 --> 1:52:00.833
Why did you say
you didn't wanna die with me?

1:52:00.916 --> 1:52:02.916
This might surprise you,
but I don't wanna die.

1:52:03.000 --> 1:52:05.000
No, up there, you said,
"I don't wanna die."

1:52:05.083 --> 1:52:06.583
"Not like this, not with you."

1:52:06.666 --> 1:52:08.541
-Why not with me?
-Well, because.

1:52:08.625 --> 1:52:11.083
-"Because" isn't an answer.
-Oh, now "because" isn't an answer?

1:52:11.166 --> 1:52:12.791
-Nope.
-Hmm.

1:52:13.625 --> 1:52:14.791
Why not with me?

1:52:15.500 --> 1:52:16.875
Well, when I said "not with you,"

1:52:16.958 --> 1:52:20.041
I meant it more in the sense that
I don't matter because I'm alone.

1:52:20.125 --> 1:52:22.666
It's not a big deal. But you're a father.
You have your son.

1:52:22.750 --> 1:52:24.291
So yeah. "Not with you" meaning

1:52:24.375 --> 1:52:26.333
it wouldn't be fair
for you to die along with me.

1:52:28.375 --> 1:52:29.958
-Why didn't you just say that?
-Listen.

1:52:30.041 --> 1:52:33.125
Everything was falling apart around us,
and it's a long sentence,

1:52:33.208 --> 1:52:36.625
so I gave you the condensed version
of the concept.

1:52:37.541 --> 1:52:40.000
-I call bullshit.
-Fine, go ahead. Don't believe me.

1:52:40.083 --> 1:52:43.583
It's bullshit that you don't matter.
You're a good guy too.

1:52:43.666 --> 1:52:44.916
And you're not alone.

1:52:45.875 --> 1:52:48.250
You have me. And I don't just have Yves.

1:52:48.333 --> 1:52:49.291
I have you.

1:52:50.083 --> 1:52:52.375
-Okay.
-What did you say before?

1:52:53.166 --> 1:52:54.750
A real team? A real duo?

1:52:54.833 --> 1:52:56.916
Are you gonna go through all the synonyms?

1:52:57.833 --> 1:53:00.291
You've been more sentimental
since our night at the hotel.

1:53:02.791 --> 1:53:04.833
You're such a dickhead.

1:53:08.708 --> 1:53:09.666
You're right.

1:53:11.958 --> 1:53:14.291
It'd be nice if people saw
who really does the work.

1:53:15.000 --> 1:53:16.833
You know someone who works in TV?

1:53:18.083 --> 1:53:18.916
Even better.

1:53:23.833 --> 1:53:25.958
MINISTRY OF THE INTERIOR
LIBERTY, EQUALITY, FRATERNITY

1:53:28.041 --> 1:53:29.375

-Check the gate!
-That was good. Perfect! Great!

1:54:08.208 --> 1:54:09.583
That's it. Mark that take, thanks.

1:54:10.916 --> 1:54:13.125
Just perfect! That was beautiful.

1:54:13.208 --> 1:54:14.791
-Really?
-It works for me. Bravo!

1:54:14.875 --> 1:54:17.375
-Can we do one more for me?
-Not sure we have the time.

1:54:17.458 --> 1:54:21.000
-Can we move on to 50-something? Okay!
-I didn't know you were here!

1:54:21.083 --> 1:54:22.291

-Yeah. Not bad.

1:54:22.375 --> 1:54:23.666
I know, right?

1:54:23.750 --> 1:54:26.125
They found a body on top
of the Eiffel Tower. You coming?

1:54:26.208 --> 1:54:28.625
I can't. I still have a scene to shoot.
I gotta hit my trailer.

1:54:29.625 --> 1:54:31.208
Sorry, sorry. Of course I'm coming.

1:54:31.291 --> 1:54:33.333
-Just have to take off my makeup.
-Right.

1:54:33.416 --> 1:54:36.833
It's nothing, just a little foundation
and some gloss. Should take five minutes.

1:54:36.916 --> 1:54:39.125
-Some what?
-Gloss. It's skincare for lips.

1:54:39.208 --> 1:54:40.750
-You wear that much?
-Too much?

1:54:40.833 --> 1:54:42.833
-Uh, yeah!
-I have to do another take.
