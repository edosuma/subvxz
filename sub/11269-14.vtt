Hey, Cliffie, take
away that beard,

01:29.838 --> 01:32.073
and you know who
I'd swear that is?

01:32.108 --> 01:33.674
Oh, yeah,

01:33.675 --> 01:35.894
you took the words
right out of my mouth, Normie.

01:35.895 --> 01:40.364
Mr. D.B. Cooper himself.

01:40.399 --> 01:42.000
Yeah, I've been trackin' him

01:42.034 --> 01:43.968
for 20 years now,

01:44.003 --> 01:48.272
and now he's found me;
The supreme irony.

01:48.306 --> 01:50.708
No, Cliff, I was going
to say Robin Colcord.

01:50.743 --> 01:51.976
Huh? Oh, yeah!

01:52.011 --> 01:53.144
Yeah, you're right.

01:53.178 --> 01:54.412
Isn't that something?

01:54.446 --> 01:57.314
Well, my search continues.

01:57.349 --> 01:58.983
A glass of ice water.

01:59.018 --> 02:00.985
And, uh, by the way,
hello, Sam.

02:01.020 --> 02:02.653
Hello, boys.

02:02.688 --> 02:04.488
I'm back.

02:04.523 --> 02:08.826
Robin!
Robin Colcord!

02:08.827 --> 02:09.728
I'll be damned.

02:09.729 --> 02:11.062
How you been?

02:11.097 --> 02:12.764
Look at you!

02:12.798 --> 02:15.133
Why you, uh, why are you
dressed like that?

02:15.134 --> 02:16.550
Well, my friends,
I'm not the same Robin Colcord

02:16.551 --> 02:19.286
you once knew-
I am penniless.

02:19.321 --> 02:20.455
CARLA:
Robin!

02:20.489 --> 02:22.424
You left here with
six million bucks!

02:22.425 --> 02:23.724
Remember, you had it hidden

02:23.725 --> 02:25.377
in that money belt
in the office?

02:25.378 --> 02:27.228
Yeah, well, I gave it away.

02:27.229 --> 02:29.730
And now I'm a drifter searching
the world without a dime

02:29.731 --> 02:32.300
and finally liking
what I find inside me.

02:32.335 --> 02:35.904
Well... great.

02:37.552 --> 02:40.491
No, seriously, Robin, you know,

02:40.492 --> 02:41.993
what have you been up to?

02:42.027 --> 02:43.177
I've been living.

02:43.212 --> 02:44.829
I walked through Europe.

02:44.864 --> 02:46.244
I worked a kibbutz in Israel.

02:46.265 --> 02:47.732
Joined the merchant marine.

02:47.767 --> 02:50.968
Had the great honour
to be blessed by the Pope.

02:51.003 --> 02:53.237
But listen to me
going on about myself.

02:53.272 --> 02:55.206
What have you fellows
been up to?

03:00.329 --> 03:03.097
Hitler moved into my building.

03:03.131 --> 03:05.050
And, uh, how's Rebecca?

03:05.084 --> 03:06.517
Is she still luscious?

03:06.552 --> 03:09.154
Uh, no. Actually,
she slimmed down.

03:10.289 --> 03:11.789
My Rebecca.

03:11.824 --> 03:14.354
You know, I can't tell you
how much I've missed her.

03:14.360 --> 03:15.660
And now to see her again,

03:15.694 --> 03:17.629
to look into those amber eyes,

03:17.663 --> 03:20.364
to hear that crystal bell
of a voice.

03:20.399 --> 03:21.499
Crap, Sam!

03:21.533 --> 03:24.169
Your desk smells like somebody
puked in it!

03:24.203 --> 03:28.006
Rebecca, I'm back.

03:28.040 --> 03:30.741
(breathless):
Robin!

03:30.776 --> 03:34.012
My sweet baby!
Is it really you?!?

03:34.013 --> 03:35.012
Yes.

03:35.013 --> 03:37.148
I knew you'd come back for me!

03:37.183 --> 03:38.583
I quit!

03:40.002 --> 03:41.119
I'm out of here.

03:41.153 --> 03:43.188
No more petty job
for Rebecca Howe.

03:43.222 --> 03:45.022
No more hanging out
with you poor,

03:45.023 --> 03:46.791
pathetic, boring
losers all day!

03:46.792 --> 03:48.059
My prayers have been answered.

03:48.060 --> 03:50.530
Robin's come back for me,
and I'm rich! I'm rich!

03:51.630 --> 03:53.931
Why are you dressed
like that, Robin?

03:53.932 --> 03:55.400
Well I've taken
a vow of poverty.

03:55.401 --> 03:56.781
I have only what I'm wearing

03:56.782 --> 03:58.636
and what I'm carrying
in my rucksack.

03:58.637 --> 04:01.439
Well, that's very sweet.

04:01.474 --> 04:04.242
Uh, did I just call
you guys a bunch

04:04.276 --> 04:05.776
of names a few minutes ago?

04:05.811 --> 04:06.911
Yeah.

04:06.912 --> 04:08.579
I'm sorry, I just
have these episodes

04:08.580 --> 04:12.450
when I'm around rich people,
sort of like a blackout.

04:12.484 --> 04:14.619
No harm done, 'kay?

04:16.122 --> 04:17.370
Uh, Robin, listen.

04:17.372 --> 04:19.307
You know, I'm really interested
in hearing all about

04:19.308 --> 04:20.874
what's been happening with you,

04:20.875 --> 04:22.843
so what say you and I
go to dinner tonight,

04:22.844 --> 04:24.345
just the two of us.

04:24.346 --> 04:26.097
Well, I'm afraid it would
have to be your treat.

04:26.098 --> 04:27.332
Of course it would.

04:27.333 --> 04:28.133
Well, splendid.

04:28.134 --> 04:29.917
I'll, uh, just go
and wash up, eh?

04:31.553 --> 04:33.004
Poor guy.

04:33.038 --> 04:34.805
It's a real comedown, isn't it?

04:34.840 --> 04:35.940
Seems happy though.

04:35.975 --> 04:38.076
Of course he's happy.

04:38.110 --> 04:40.111
He's lying.

04:40.145 --> 04:42.230
I'm afraid of the rest of this.

04:42.264 --> 04:44.332
Sam, don't you see it?
He's testing me.

04:44.333 --> 04:45.934
Remember the last time
before he left,

04:45.935 --> 04:48.269
he pretended like he was poor
and I rejected him?

04:48.270 --> 04:50.855
And then it turns out
he wasn't poor, he was rich?

04:50.856 --> 04:52.123
Well, he's testing me again.

04:52.124 --> 04:53.624
He wants to see if I've matured.

04:53.658 --> 04:55.059
And I'm gonna make damn sure

04:55.060 --> 04:57.695
that he knows that material
wealth means nothing to me.

04:57.696 --> 04:59.463
And then he'll marry me
and take me away.

04:59.464 --> 05:01.032
And I won't have to spend
any more time

05:01.033 --> 05:03.101
with you poor, pathetic,
boring losers.

05:04.670 --> 05:06.554
Day after day after day!

05:06.588 --> 05:09.190
Honey, it's happening again.

05:09.224 --> 05:11.526
What? What's happening?

05:17.282 --> 05:19.367
Hello, everyone!

05:19.401 --> 05:20.768
So, what's new?

05:20.769 --> 05:22.102
Hey, Doc,
you'd better settle in.

05:22.103 --> 05:23.654
Have we got a surprise for you.

05:23.688 --> 05:24.823
Really?

05:24.857 --> 05:27.058
Oh, yeah, yeah,
a real shockeroo.

05:27.093 --> 05:28.960
You'll never guess who's back.

05:28.994 --> 05:31.979
It's Lilith, isn't it?

05:33.665 --> 05:35.049
Oh, thank God!

05:35.084 --> 05:36.917
She wants me back!

05:36.952 --> 05:40.188
Oh!
Everything's gonna be okay now!

05:40.222 --> 05:41.555
I'll fall to my knees

05:41.556 --> 05:43.924
and tell her what a living hell
my life has been!

05:43.925 --> 05:48.629
At last, the long nightmare
is finally over!

05:48.663 --> 05:50.398
Where is my beautiful girl?

05:50.432 --> 05:53.100
Well, Doc, actually,
it's Robin Colcord.

05:57.823 --> 06:02.192
Oh... good.

06:02.227 --> 06:04.517
I wouldn't take
that broad back if you paid me.

06:09.401 --> 06:11.202
How'd it go?

06:11.203 --> 06:12.303
(quietly):
He's testing me,

06:12.304 --> 06:14.105
but I'm passing
with flying colours.

06:14.106 --> 06:16.441
Sam, uh, I hate to trouble you,

06:16.475 --> 06:19.910
but do you think I could sleep
in your storage room tonight?

06:19.945 --> 06:21.379
Sure.

06:21.413 --> 06:22.803
Oh, Robin, don't be silly!

06:22.804 --> 06:24.465
You're not gonna
sleep in a storage room.

06:24.466 --> 06:25.833
I have a perfectly good
apartment.

06:25.834 --> 06:27.001
You're gonna stay with me.

06:27.002 --> 06:28.236
Rebecca, you are an angel.

06:28.237 --> 06:29.553
So, Rob,

06:29.588 --> 06:33.024
tell me the truth,
you really don't miss having the big bucks?

06:33.058 --> 06:34.308
Not a bit of it.

06:34.343 --> 06:37.478
Money makes people greedy,
and greed is a disease.

06:37.513 --> 06:38.946
I was a miser.

06:38.947 --> 06:41.049
A sick little squirrel
hiding money belts

06:41.050 --> 06:43.851
filled with millions of dollars
all over the world.

06:43.885 --> 06:46.704
You mean, uh,
there were other ones besides that one

06:46.738 --> 06:48.605
you hid in the desk
in Sam's office?

06:48.640 --> 06:50.708
I-I used to hide them
in pairs, backups,

06:50.709 --> 06:52.377
in case someone found
the first one.

06:52.378 --> 06:54.128
Well, thank God I'm no longer

06:54.129 --> 06:55.146
obsessed by money.

06:55.147 --> 06:57.497
Now all I need is happiness
and companionship.

06:57.516 --> 06:58.883
Uh, do you mind, darling?

06:58.884 --> 07:00.601
I've been walking
since Tuesday.

07:00.602 --> 07:02.120
Can we go home now?

07:02.154 --> 07:05.356
Yes. You are inspiration.

07:05.390 --> 07:07.174
And I, too, feel

07:07.175 --> 07:08.792
that money is the
root of all evil

07:08.793 --> 07:10.361
and that friendship
is true gold.

07:10.362 --> 07:15.133
That's why I value your
friendship so much, Robin.

07:15.167 --> 07:18.302
Money! Money! Money!
Money! Money!

07:18.337 --> 07:22.373
So, did anyone else
hear Robin say

07:22.408 --> 07:25.476
that he hides money
belts in pairs?

07:25.511 --> 07:27.194
Uh, I did.

07:27.229 --> 07:29.530
Yeah, but he, uh,
only walked out of here

07:29.564 --> 07:31.065
with one of them.

07:31.099 --> 07:32.149
Uh-huh.

07:32.167 --> 07:33.234
You don't suppose...

07:33.268 --> 07:35.186
Oh, come on,
give me a break, you guys.

07:35.187 --> 07:36.454
I know what you're thinking.

07:36.455 --> 07:37.722
There's no way in hell

07:37.723 --> 07:39.757
that he put another
money belt in this place.

07:39.758 --> 07:41.092
It's ridiculous.

07:41.126 --> 07:42.393
Yeah.

07:42.427 --> 07:44.428
Yeah, you're right,
Sam, I guess.

07:44.462 --> 07:45.612
Damn right I am.

07:45.647 --> 07:48.282
Okay, closing time!
Everybody out!

07:57.376 --> 07:59.677
Come on, I mean it.
We're closed. Get out.

07:59.711 --> 08:01.512
Sammy, it's only
ten after 8:00.

08:01.513 --> 08:03.381
(yawns):
Yeah, well, I'm really tired.

08:03.382 --> 08:05.750
Come on, let's go.
Everybody out.

08:05.784 --> 08:08.986
Sam Malone, you know, you ought
to be ashamed of yourself.

08:09.021 --> 08:11.321
As soon as money enters
the picture,

08:11.356 --> 08:13.390
you try to kick out
all your friends.

08:13.424 --> 08:16.927
Now, who was there for you
when Diane left you, huh?

08:16.962 --> 08:19.697
Who was there for you
when this bar burned down?

08:19.731 --> 08:22.933
Us, your friends, that's who.

08:22.968 --> 08:26.270
I'm not kidding, get out.

08:26.305 --> 08:30.140
Don't forget, Sam,
that's not your money.

08:30.175 --> 08:33.344
If one of us finds it
and tries to keep it,

08:33.379 --> 08:36.280
the others can blow
the whistle.

08:36.313 --> 08:40.134
You guys would really
send me to jail?

08:40.168 --> 08:43.437
In a heartbeat.

08:44.823 --> 08:47.325
Okay, then here's the deal.

08:47.326 --> 08:48.359
This is my bar.

08:48.360 --> 08:51.729
Whoever finds it, I get half.

08:51.763 --> 08:53.597
Huh? What do you say?

08:53.631 --> 08:55.532
Huh?

08:55.533 --> 08:57.568
All right.
All right, sounds reasonable.

08:57.569 --> 09:00.137
And then the other half will be
divided among ourselves.

09:00.138 --> 09:03.858
I suggest that we split into
teams to expedite the search.

09:03.892 --> 09:05.676
Sounds good to me.

09:05.710 --> 09:09.363
Of course it sounds good
to him, he gets half.

09:09.364 --> 09:11.082
What do you think
you're doing, Sam?

09:11.083 --> 09:14.085
I'm gonna read my paper until
one of you brings me my half.

09:14.119 --> 09:16.137
All right.
Let's get to work.

09:16.171 --> 09:18.523
Yeah.
Let's get to work.

09:18.557 --> 09:20.425
Say, uh, Normie,

09:20.459 --> 09:23.093
does Sammy get half
of what we find

09:23.128 --> 09:26.631
or, uh, half of what
we claim to find?

09:26.665 --> 09:28.449
Oh, what we claim to find.

09:28.450 --> 09:30.018
After all, the guy's
not a mind reader.

09:30.019 --> 09:31.352
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

09:31.353 --> 09:33.137
So, uh, we find
something that's got,

09:33.138 --> 09:36.974
say, $6 million in it,
we only give him $3 million.

09:36.975 --> 09:39.042
Yeah. We call it a
finder's fee, shall we?

09:39.043 --> 09:40.711
Oh, my man.

09:40.746 --> 09:42.680
Yeah...

09:44.583 --> 09:47.818

finder's fee, shall we?

I'll get you a

10:28.627 --> 10:31.428

That's good of you, Rebecca.

10:32.531 --> 10:34.164
You know, it must be

10:34.165 --> 10:36.099
I mean, after all,
we have a history.

10:36.100 --> 10:38.218
Oh, Robin,
please don't bring up the past.

10:38.219 --> 10:40.855
I just feel so ashamed
of the way I used to be.

10:40.889 --> 10:42.573
I was so...

10:42.607 --> 10:44.908
so bratty and so greedy.

10:44.943 --> 10:46.844
I'd just rather
not talk about it.

10:46.878 --> 10:49.246
(phone rings)

10:49.281 --> 10:51.571
Why don't you get that
and I'll be right back?

10:52.835 --> 10:54.501
Howe residence. Oh!

10:54.536 --> 10:56.070
Uh, hello, Frasier.

10:56.071 --> 10:58.272
I was just thinking
about how you mentioned

10:58.273 --> 11:00.674
that you used to use,
uh, hidden money belts,

11:00.709 --> 11:02.743
as financial security.

11:02.777 --> 11:05.113
Well, it just so happens

11:05.147 --> 11:09.984
that I have some valuables
that I'd like to hide.

11:10.018 --> 11:12.953
But where?

11:12.988 --> 11:15.590
So I'd like to pick
your brain if I could.

11:15.624 --> 11:19.560
Uh, I know that you favoured
the underside of desk drawers,

11:19.595 --> 11:22.530
but, uh, I thought
you might throw out some more ideas.

11:22.531 --> 11:24.582
Pretend that
you're the old Robin. (call waiting beeps)

11:24.583 --> 11:27.084
Uh, uh, Frasier, would you just
hold for a minute?

11:27.085 --> 11:28.819
I have another call coming in.

11:28.854 --> 11:30.220
Hello?

11:30.255 --> 11:32.640
Oh, yeah, hey,
Robin, listen, uh...

11:32.674 --> 11:35.109
yeah, found some sort
of a money belt

11:35.143 --> 11:36.944
and I assume it's yours here,

11:36.945 --> 11:38.795
you know, but I hate
to cause any problems

11:38.796 --> 11:39.846
in case it's not.

11:39.865 --> 11:41.032
So, okay I get it.

11:41.033 --> 11:43.101
Why don't you tell me
where you hid yours

11:43.102 --> 11:44.635
and-and I'll tell you

11:44.669 --> 11:47.504
if that's where
I found this one.

11:47.505 --> 11:49.673
Well, uh, Cliff, I must admit
that I had a penchant

11:49.674 --> 11:51.842
for hiding them
in, uh, ductwork.

11:51.843 --> 11:54.011
You know, that way they'd
be easy to get to and, uh,

11:54.012 --> 11:55.145
impervious to damage.

11:55.146 --> 11:56.547
Oh, uh, great, great, great.

11:56.548 --> 11:58.315
Oh, uh, I guess
this isn't yours.

11:58.350 --> 12:00.067
Okay.
Uh, Frasier?

12:00.101 --> 12:01.919
Oh, Robin. Hi.
Yeah. Oh, that's okay.

12:01.953 --> 12:05.956
Uh... Mm-hmm.

12:05.990 --> 12:07.958
Ductwork, you say.

12:07.992 --> 12:09.260
Good-bye.

12:09.261 --> 12:10.294
It's in the ducts.

12:10.295 --> 12:11.895
We're rich. We're rich.

12:11.896 --> 12:12.730
Who was that?

12:12.731 --> 12:13.881
Your friends.

12:13.882 --> 12:15.349
They're tearing apart
your place of work

12:15.350 --> 12:18.152
looking for one
of my money belts. Oh.

12:18.186 --> 12:19.756
Well, don't be
too hard on them.

12:19.787 --> 12:22.806
You know, the sad part
is that two years ago

12:22.807 --> 12:24.975
I would have been right
over there with them.

12:24.976 --> 12:26.260
Yeah... But, you gotta admit,

12:26.261 --> 12:28.512
a million dollars
is pretty tempting.

12:28.513 --> 12:30.347
But you're not
tempted anymore, huh?

12:30.348 --> 12:32.616
Oh! No, no, no, not me.

12:32.651 --> 12:34.952
Well, I mean... yes.

12:34.953 --> 12:36.654
It would be nice
because of the good

12:36.655 --> 12:39.090
that you could do with it.

12:39.124 --> 12:41.159
I would love nothing more

12:41.193 --> 12:43.294
than to be able to
spend a lot of money

12:43.328 --> 12:44.829
on my favourite charity.

12:44.863 --> 12:46.164
Which one is that?

12:46.198 --> 12:48.316
Oh, that's the
Children's Boston...

12:48.350 --> 12:50.618
something-something.

12:50.652 --> 12:52.536
You know... you're wonderful.

12:52.571 --> 12:54.305
You know, you really are

12:54.339 --> 12:55.539
a lovely woman, Rebecca.

12:55.540 --> 12:57.341
And, Robin, you are the most

12:57.375 --> 12:58.509
handsome, charming,

12:58.543 --> 13:00.511
sophisticated man
I've ever met.

13:00.512 --> 13:01.578
Well, thank you.

13:01.579 --> 13:02.746
Uh, now, if you'll excuse me,

13:02.747 --> 13:04.248
I must go and wash
out my underwear

13:04.249 --> 13:05.999
in the bathroom
sink for tomorrow.

13:09.139 --> 13:11.188
Robin?

13:11.189 --> 13:12.189
Uh-huh?

13:12.190 --> 13:13.457
You didn't by any chance

13:13.458 --> 13:14.825
hide one of those money belts

13:14.826 --> 13:16.026
over here, ever, did you?

13:16.027 --> 13:17.661
Hah. Well,
I mean, if I did,

13:17.662 --> 13:19.630
you-you'd be sure to
have found it by now.

13:19.631 --> 13:21.031
I mean, you have cleaned up

13:21.032 --> 13:22.833
in the past two
years, haven't you?

13:22.834 --> 13:24.535
(laughing):
Of course I have.

13:31.176 --> 13:32.443
Be cool. Be cool.

13:38.450 --> 13:41.151
(sighs and groans)

13:41.186 --> 13:42.720
That's it.

13:42.754 --> 13:44.555
There's nothing in the ducts.

13:44.589 --> 13:47.975
We checked the office,
the pool room, the rest-rooms.

13:48.010 --> 13:49.310
I don't get it.

13:52.664 --> 13:54.699
Unless you two are lying.

13:54.733 --> 13:56.651
Huh?

13:56.685 --> 13:59.303
Just going along
with this duct thing

13:59.337 --> 14:01.938
waiting for us to keel
over with exhaustion.

14:01.973 --> 14:04.442
Oh, yeah?

14:04.476 --> 14:06.711
How do we know that
you two aren't lying?

14:06.712 --> 14:08.712
That's it, Clavin,
you're history, man.

14:08.713 --> 14:09.980
All right.
Come on, Tortelli.

14:09.981 --> 14:11.249
Take your best shot, huh?

14:11.283 --> 14:12.783
I never liked you anyway.

14:12.784 --> 14:15.152
I only pretended to because
you liked me, obviously.

14:15.153 --> 14:16.804
(growling)

14:16.838 --> 14:19.389
No, Carla.
Carla, no! No!

14:19.424 --> 14:20.825
Stop it. Stop it.

14:20.859 --> 14:23.627
Don't you see? Greed's
turning us into animals.

14:23.661 --> 14:27.130
We've got to behave like
civilized human beings.

14:27.165 --> 14:29.333
All right.
All right.

14:29.367 --> 14:31.935
Now...

14:31.969 --> 14:33.437
I've got...

14:33.471 --> 14:36.106
some sodium
Pentathol in my car.

14:38.643 --> 14:41.912
If one of you is
lying, we'll know it.

14:44.649 --> 14:47.084
Are you sure you've
looked in all the ducts?

14:47.085 --> 14:48.318
Yeah, we looked in all of them.

14:48.319 --> 14:49.520
Unless they were in the ducts

14:49.521 --> 14:50.787
that burned up in the fire.

14:50.788 --> 14:52.989
What are you saying? Six million
bucks went up in smoke?

14:52.990 --> 14:54.458
SAM:
Aw, it doesn't make any sense.

14:54.459 --> 14:56.660
I mean, I cleaned up most
of that rubble myself.

14:56.661 --> 14:58.329
You know, there would
have been some traces...

14:58.330 --> 15:01.232
a buckle, some burnt
pieces of money, something.

15:01.266 --> 15:03.534
Sam, you're...
you're certain

15:03.568 --> 15:07.571
you were alone
and you saw nothing?

15:07.605 --> 15:10.308
Now, listen, go back
in your mind's eye.

15:10.342 --> 15:11.792
SAM:
All right. Yeah.

15:11.793 --> 15:13.494
All right, I,
uh, came running in.

15:13.495 --> 15:15.796
Everything was
charred and moist,

15:15.831 --> 15:18.232
and I sweeped up a little bit

15:18.266 --> 15:22.436
and there was some wood,
some glass, some metal.

15:22.471 --> 15:25.272
Oh, yeah, then captain, uh...

15:25.306 --> 15:26.707
a fire captain came in

15:26.708 --> 15:27.991
and asked me...
A fire captain?

15:27.992 --> 15:29.460
Oh, yeah.

15:29.494 --> 15:30.828
Captain Dobbins.

15:30.862 --> 15:32.930
He was there when I came in
in the morning.

15:32.965 --> 15:35.299
Yeah, well, I think
we have our answer. Hmm.

15:36.220 --> 15:38.152
Hi.

15:38.153 --> 15:41.272
Let me speak to Captain Dobbins.

15:41.306 --> 15:43.039
Oh, he retired, did he?

15:43.074 --> 15:44.809
Hah!

15:44.843 --> 15:47.278
Six months ago?!

15:47.312 --> 15:48.579
Thank you

15:48.613 --> 15:49.897
very much.

15:51.983 --> 15:54.885
Apparently the good captain
has come into some money.

15:54.920 --> 15:56.420
That crook stole our dough.

15:56.455 --> 15:58.288
Yeah. Gotta get
him down here.

15:58.289 --> 16:00.207
Yeah. How? We just
can't give him a call

16:00.208 --> 16:02.142
and ask him to drop on by.

16:02.176 --> 16:03.893
Yeah. Yeah, what
are we gonna do?

16:03.928 --> 16:05.762
Leave this
to me, Sam. Oh.

16:05.796 --> 16:08.565
I happen to know some
people who can handle

16:08.600 --> 16:10.590
this kind of thing,
no questions asked.

16:10.602 --> 16:14.905
Might cost us a little,
but they do good work.

16:14.940 --> 16:16.189
Hi. It's Mommy.

16:16.224 --> 16:17.858
Wake up your brothers.

16:22.297 --> 16:24.515
Robin,

16:24.549 --> 16:27.584
do you ever think about us?

16:27.585 --> 16:29.386
Well, I have to
admit, Rebecca, yes.

16:29.387 --> 16:31.221
Sometimes I do.

16:31.255 --> 16:34.507
I have to tell you that
since we broke up...

16:34.508 --> 16:37.961
a day has not gone by
that I haven't regretted it.

16:37.962 --> 16:39.663
It-It was the biggest
mistake of my life.

16:39.664 --> 16:40.864
Do you really feel that way?

16:40.865 --> 16:41.998
Yeah, I do.

16:42.033 --> 16:43.951
Robin, take me back.

16:43.985 --> 16:45.052
Please?

16:45.086 --> 16:46.320
I want to be with you.

16:46.354 --> 16:47.705
And I know you don't

16:47.706 --> 16:48.972
have any money, and that's fine.

16:48.973 --> 16:50.641
Let's just go around
the world together.

16:50.642 --> 16:52.809
I don't want to have
any material things.

16:52.843 --> 16:54.611
I'll just, I'll just pack a bag

16:54.646 --> 16:58.815
of some, a few meagre things,
and some makeup essentials

16:58.849 --> 17:02.118
and... and then we'll
travel around together.

17:02.153 --> 17:04.588
You'd really give up
everything for me?

17:04.622 --> 17:06.372
Oh, yeah. You bet
your booty I would.

17:06.373 --> 17:07.974
I wouldn't make
that mistake twice.

17:07.976 --> 17:11.228
Rebecca, I'd love to have you
share my journeys with me.

17:11.262 --> 17:12.896
Robin.

17:12.930 --> 17:14.064
Oh.

17:14.065 --> 17:15.281
But, let, uh, there's, um,

17:15.282 --> 17:17.384
just-just one thing
I have to tell you.

17:17.417 --> 17:18.968
How much?
I mean, go ahead.

17:19.587 --> 17:22.289
You see, occasionally, I, um,

17:22.290 --> 17:25.258
I supplement my meagre
lifestyle by stealing.

17:25.292 --> 17:27.260
I did some time
for that in Louisiana.

17:27.295 --> 17:29.129
We may have to run
from the police,

17:29.163 --> 17:31.465
sleep under bridges,
eat out of garbage cans.

17:31.499 --> 17:32.866
Oh, Robin, cut the crap.

17:32.900 --> 17:36.120
I said I would go away with you,
yadda-yadda-yadda-yadda.

17:36.154 --> 17:37.721
Now, let's get real.

17:37.755 --> 17:40.407
Uh, what are you talking about?

17:40.408 --> 17:41.825
I'm talking about,
you wanted to know

17:41.826 --> 17:43.827
if I would still love
you if you were poor,

17:43.828 --> 17:45.595
and I would, so
we've settled that.

17:45.596 --> 17:47.080
So how much money do you have?

17:47.081 --> 17:49.133
$30 million?
$40 million?

17:49.134 --> 17:51.535
You mean all this time you
thought I was still wealthy

17:51.536 --> 17:53.453
and that's why you've
been so kind to me?

17:53.454 --> 17:54.871
You haven't changed
a bit, have you?

17:54.872 --> 17:56.340
You haven't matured.

17:56.341 --> 17:58.975
You're still the same selfish,
gold digger you always were.

17:58.976 --> 18:01.044
I'm poor.
Do you understand?

18:01.078 --> 18:03.547
Destitute.
I have to shoplift for food.

18:03.581 --> 18:06.683
Sometimes I even have
to beg for money.

18:06.718 --> 18:08.301
Ten million?

18:08.336 --> 18:10.887
Zero.

18:10.921 --> 18:12.422
I'm poor.

18:12.457 --> 18:14.658
And I have no desire
ever to be rich again.

18:14.659 --> 18:17.144
You're not kidding, are you?
No, I'm not kidding.

18:17.145 --> 18:18.585
If my prediction is correct,

18:18.597 --> 18:20.897
you'll find that
your affection for me

18:20.898 --> 18:22.149
has suddenly disappeared.
Oh, no.

18:22.150 --> 18:24.084
No, it has not. I
still care a great...

18:26.154 --> 18:27.537
(sighs)

18:27.571 --> 18:30.590
Who am I kidding?

18:30.624 --> 18:33.477
Oh, God.

18:33.511 --> 18:36.780
I haven't changed
one bit in two years.

18:36.815 --> 18:39.633
Yeah, well, I can't say
I'm not disappointed.

18:39.667 --> 18:42.969
Robin, I'm so
sorry. Please... Good-bye.

18:43.004 --> 18:44.571
Good-bye, Rebecca.

18:50.312 --> 18:51.912
Good-bye, Robin.

18:56.635 --> 18:58.452
(grunts)

18:59.737 --> 19:01.071
Thanks, kids!

19:01.105 --> 19:02.540
Now wipe down the car,

19:02.574 --> 19:04.542
ditch it and get right to bed!

19:04.576 --> 19:05.842
It's a school night!

19:07.579 --> 19:09.547
Oh, Sam. Thank God!

19:09.581 --> 19:11.882
Do you know this person?

19:11.916 --> 19:13.984
Shut up, moneybags.

19:14.018 --> 19:19.105
Sammy, guess who's living
in a brand-new house.

19:19.140 --> 19:20.908
Oh, a new house and retirement.

19:20.942 --> 19:23.176
You've got a lot of
explaining to do, buster.

19:23.210 --> 19:24.761
What are you talking about?

19:24.796 --> 19:28.465
Maybe you would like to tell us
how you got rich six months ago.

19:28.500 --> 19:29.567
Mm-hmm.

19:29.601 --> 19:31.768
My grandmother passed away.

19:31.802 --> 19:33.303
Do you mind?

19:33.338 --> 19:35.789
We happen to know
there was a money belt

19:35.790 --> 19:37.291
hidden in one
of those air ducts

19:37.292 --> 19:38.925
in that wall that burned down,

19:38.960 --> 19:41.795
and that money disappeared
right around the same time

19:41.829 --> 19:45.131
your grandma
so conveniently checked out.

19:45.166 --> 19:46.767
Mm-hmm.

19:46.801 --> 19:48.802
So, what have you
got to say there...

19:48.837 --> 19:51.005
Mr. Trump?
Hmm?

19:51.039 --> 19:52.339
This is ridiculous.

19:52.373 --> 19:54.474
I don't know anything
about a money belt.

19:54.509 --> 19:58.912
I have half a mind to call
the police on all of you.

19:58.947 --> 20:00.797
Oh...
Oh... I'm terrified.

20:00.832 --> 20:02.799
Aw, Captain, Captain.

20:02.834 --> 20:05.268
You know, I think we can
straighten this all out.

20:05.302 --> 20:08.872
Why don't you and me just take
a little walk into the office?

20:08.906 --> 20:11.274
Oh...
What are you doing?

20:11.308 --> 20:12.609
Right over there.

20:12.610 --> 20:13.877
Go on in there with Carla.

20:13.878 --> 20:16.747
Oh, what are you doing?

20:19.317 --> 20:21.685
My God.
Look at you people.

20:21.720 --> 20:23.520
Robin.

20:23.555 --> 20:25.289
Look at your bar, Sam.

20:25.290 --> 20:28.191
In your greedy desire to obtain
a non existent money belt,

20:28.192 --> 20:30.327
you destroyed what
was most important to you.

20:30.328 --> 20:34.614
Excuse me. What was that
word right before "money belt"?

20:34.649 --> 20:36.316
Non existent.

20:36.350 --> 20:37.484
Fictitious.

20:37.519 --> 20:38.818
Uh, mythic.

20:38.853 --> 20:39.970
Nothing?

20:40.004 --> 20:43.173
Not even like a small
change purse?

20:43.208 --> 20:45.438
Nothing. And here
you've torn apart your bar.

20:45.443 --> 20:47.644
I'll bet you turned
on each other, too.

20:47.678 --> 20:50.447
How many side deals
did you have going?

20:50.481 --> 20:51.865
Oh.

20:51.899 --> 20:53.299
(all groan and mutter)

20:56.904 --> 21:00.139
Oh, Robin, man, how
could you do this to us?

21:00.174 --> 21:03.276
To show you what money
can do to a person.

21:03.310 --> 21:05.378
You all despised me
when I was wealthy.

21:05.379 --> 21:06.780
You didn't
understand that I was

21:06.781 --> 21:08.615
victim of an illness- greed.

21:08.616 --> 21:10.984
But now you do understand,
because all of you here tonight

21:10.985 --> 21:13.821
have fallen victim
to that same illness.

21:13.822 --> 21:15.622
Hopefully you've all
learned something.

21:15.623 --> 21:17.607
And that's why
I did what I did.

21:17.642 --> 21:18.809
Uh...

21:18.843 --> 21:22.496
plus, uh, I never
really liked you.

21:22.530 --> 21:23.797
Ta.

21:27.217 --> 21:31.704
Yeah, I have to admit,
Robin's right.

21:31.739 --> 21:34.975
Look what we've
done to this place.

21:35.009 --> 21:38.311
To each other.

21:38.345 --> 21:42.315
Look what we've become.

21:42.349 --> 21:43.550
Yeah. Boy,
I tell you,

21:43.585 --> 21:46.286
money makes people do
strange things, doesn't it?

21:47.338 --> 21:49.540
Has anybody seen Robin?

21:49.574 --> 21:50.874
Yeah, he just left.

21:50.875 --> 21:54.578
Honey, it turns out there
wasn't a money belt.

21:54.579 --> 21:55.846
He really is poor.

21:55.880 --> 21:58.665
He tried to tell me that, too,
and I almost bought it.

21:58.699 --> 22:03.136
Well, good-bye, you poor,
pathetic, boring losers.

22:03.170 --> 22:04.771
I'm a-movin' on up.

22:08.460 --> 22:12.613
Well, I suppose we should
try to clean up this mess

22:12.647 --> 22:14.581
and put all that
nonsense behind us.

22:14.616 --> 22:18.384
Well, I suppose we all
learned something, huh?

22:18.419 --> 22:20.621
No harm came of it,
though, I guess.

22:20.655 --> 22:22.823
You know...
a few things got broken,

22:22.857 --> 22:24.257
but no one really got hurt.

22:24.292 --> 22:26.609
(Captain screaming)

22:26.644 --> 22:29.046
That's hot!

22:32.082 --> 22:34.101
(horn honks)

22:35.336 --> 22:38.505
Robin, you are so good.

22:38.539 --> 22:41.774
What are we really
waiting for, a limo?
