<i>Previously on</i> Stargate Atlantis.

00:03.430 --> 00:04.587
Who are you?

00:05.123 --> 00:06.426
Nabel Golan.

00:06.558 --> 00:09.086
You're the one responsible
for the death of the Athosians.

00:09.280 --> 00:10.846
Unless I lied about that as well.

00:11.194 --> 00:13.473
<i>I believe I had a vision last night.</i>

00:13.636 --> 00:14.808
<i>I saw Kanaan,</i>

00:14.969 --> 00:16.392
<i>the father of my son.</i>

00:16.795 --> 00:18.639
- Where are you?
- Dart!

00:21.998 --> 00:24.526
<i>Do not destroy the enemy ship.
Teyla may be on board.</i>

00:24.761 --> 00:25.819
Bad news, Sheppard.

00:26.145 --> 00:29.531
<i>The cruiser made the jump
to hyperspace. It's gone.</i>

00:32.063 --> 00:33.063
Kanaan...

00:33.578 --> 00:35.936
I came for you, just like you asked.

00:36.158 --> 00:37.158
Like I asked.

00:39.452 --> 00:40.418
Michael.

00:42.303 --> 00:44.130
- Any sign of her, Sir?
- She's not here.

00:45.813 --> 00:49.169
Finally. It's about bloody time.
What took you so long?

01:02.885 --> 01:04.084
It's just weird.

01:20.799 --> 01:22.804
I'm sorry about all this, Doctor.

01:23.029 --> 01:25.440
All right. I realize there's
a protocol when dealing with someone

01:25.574 --> 01:27.495
who's been a prisoner for a long time.

01:27.615 --> 01:29.018
In fact, I wrote it.

01:30.295 --> 01:33.135
Although, if you take much more blood,
I think I might faint.

01:33.298 --> 01:34.765
That's the last batch.

01:35.658 --> 01:37.862
You should also check
for trace narcotics.

01:37.982 --> 01:40.679
Michael was giving me regular injections
of some sort of drug cocktail

01:40.800 --> 01:43.440
- mostly sedatives, I think.
- All right.

01:49.366 --> 01:50.778
You sure he's not a Replicator?

01:50.898 --> 01:52.722
No, scans would have
picked it up right away.

01:52.842 --> 01:54.584
- Then who the hell is he?
- I don't know.

01:54.704 --> 01:56.947
I'm as freaked out
about this as you are.

01:57.067 --> 01:58.716
You don't really think it's him.

01:58.846 --> 02:00.663
No. Well, I mean... maybe.

02:01.410 --> 02:02.941
We've ruled out advanced robotics.

02:03.061 --> 02:06.520
That still leaves us half a dozen
possible other explanations.

02:06.821 --> 02:07.626
Like?

02:07.778 --> 02:10.340
Well, like alternate timeline,
parallel universe, cloning,

02:10.460 --> 02:13.175
- you know, take your pick.
- Just another day in outer space.

02:13.339 --> 02:14.139
Yeah.

02:18.812 --> 02:19.612
Well...

02:20.325 --> 02:22.492
we've completed the preliminary exam.

02:22.708 --> 02:23.554
And?

02:24.586 --> 02:26.633
Every test we've run confirms it.

02:28.132 --> 02:31.070
That man down there
is Dr. Carson Beckett.

03:43.795 --> 03:45.224
- Rodney.
- Carson.

03:45.520 --> 03:48.279
So sorry I haven't come by before now.
It's been pretty hectic here

03:48.402 --> 03:50.723
- the last few days.
- That's all right. I understand.

03:50.873 --> 03:52.655
Any word on when I can get out of here?

03:53.516 --> 03:55.363
That might take a little time.

03:56.495 --> 03:57.295
Really?

03:58.432 --> 03:59.906
God, it's good to see you.

04:00.037 --> 04:01.393
Think about how I feel.

04:01.516 --> 04:04.462
I'm the one that's been a prisoner
for almost two years.

04:05.688 --> 04:06.758
Two years?

04:07.258 --> 04:09.761
Aye. Since M8G-352.

04:10.738 --> 04:13.098
The planet where we left Michael
and the other converted Wraith.

04:13.225 --> 04:15.075
- Right.
- That's where you were captured.

04:15.727 --> 04:16.726
Well, yes.

04:17.284 --> 04:19.783
You do remember, Rodney?
- Yes. Yeah, I just...

04:20.380 --> 04:22.723
Well, we need you to fill in
some of the details.

04:22.969 --> 04:23.975
Well, all right.

04:24.644 --> 04:27.160
Well, as you may have already guessed,

04:27.285 --> 04:29.527
the treatment was less
than 100% effective.

04:30.881 --> 04:33.772
<i>Despite the daily injections,
some of them began to revert,</i>

04:34.230 --> 04:35.250
<i>including Michael.</i>

04:37.663 --> 04:39.489
<i>They may have used
their telepathic abilities</i>

04:39.609 --> 04:42.276
<i>to summon a hive ship,
but I can't be certain.</i>

04:42.396 --> 04:45.049
<i>All I know is I was being
interrogated by Michael,</i>

04:45.173 --> 04:47.418
<i>then he must have given me
an injection of some kind,</i>

04:47.540 --> 04:50.324
because the next thing I remember,
I woke up on another planet.

04:50.445 --> 04:51.858
Why did he take you prisoner?

04:52.118 --> 04:54.508
He wanted me to help with his research,

04:54.628 --> 04:56.215
combining Wraith and human DNA.

04:57.502 --> 04:59.308
Of course, I refused at first,

05:00.665 --> 05:01.877
but then, one day,

05:02.687 --> 05:04.555
he brought another
prisoner into my cell.

05:04.950 --> 05:06.263
A young lady.

05:07.666 --> 05:09.499
Couldn't have been
more than 20 years of age.

05:12.523 --> 05:14.814
And he killed her in cold blood
right in front of my eyes.

05:15.518 --> 05:20.197
He said every day I refused to help,
he'd kill another just like her.

05:20.358 --> 05:22.274
From that moment on, I cooperated.

05:24.753 --> 05:27.061
Carson, I'm so sorry.

05:27.953 --> 05:29.330
It wasn't easy.

05:30.035 --> 05:32.041
I'll admit, at times,
I almost gave up hope.

05:33.467 --> 05:35.850
But that's when I thought about you,
Colonel Sheppard, Teyla,

05:35.970 --> 05:37.836
and the rest of the team.

05:38.534 --> 05:40.565
I knew you'd be out there
somewhere looking for me.

05:42.557 --> 05:43.497
Yeah.

05:44.122 --> 05:46.348
See, the thing is, we weren't.

05:46.682 --> 05:48.524
- Weren't what?
- We weren't looking for you.

05:48.644 --> 05:50.520
- We didn't know you were missing.
- Excuse me?

05:51.429 --> 05:55.274
We went back to M8G-352.
We rescued you from Michael.

05:55.434 --> 05:58.580
He got away, but we got you back
to Atlantis safe and sound.

05:59.220 --> 06:02.231
- What the hell are you talking about?
- Obviously, not you, but another you,

06:02.351 --> 06:04.282
another Carson Beckett.

06:05.644 --> 06:06.659
Is this a joke?

06:07.212 --> 06:08.368
I wish it was.

06:08.600 --> 06:11.478
You're telling me there's another
Carson Beckett walking around this base?

06:11.600 --> 06:13.315
- Well, no.
- Rodney!

06:15.567 --> 06:18.477
He came back from the planet.
He resumed his duties.

06:18.597 --> 06:20.587
Everything went back to normal.

06:22.635 --> 06:24.366
And then about six months later,

06:25.496 --> 06:27.511
he was killed in an explosion.

06:29.747 --> 06:31.922
To us, you weren't missing, Carson,

06:32.762 --> 06:33.839
you were dead.

06:39.944 --> 06:41.940
Have you spoken to your Wraith contact?

06:42.060 --> 06:44.596
He claims he's given us everything
he knows about Michael, but

06:44.716 --> 06:45.789
I assume he's lying.

06:45.910 --> 06:49.699
Until we can come up with something that
he can use, he's not much good to us.

06:49.819 --> 06:51.664
So we need to find
our intel somewhere else.

06:51.825 --> 06:54.200
That's what I wanted
to talk to you about.

06:55.321 --> 06:56.395
You mean Beckett.

06:56.734 --> 06:59.705
He has been inside Michael's operation
and he may know something.

06:59.825 --> 07:02.400
Or he could have been
planted there for us to find.

07:02.520 --> 07:04.745
For all we know, this whole thing
could be a set-up.

07:04.865 --> 07:06.667
Sure, anything's possible.

07:07.415 --> 07:10.215
John, the Carson Beckett
you knew was killed.

07:10.784 --> 07:12.789
You were there.
You all were.

07:13.065 --> 07:16.164
I'm sorry to say it,
but you need to remember that.

07:18.255 --> 07:20.035
I know this is a lot
for you to take in...

07:20.155 --> 07:21.785
Aye, you're damn right it is.

07:21.905 --> 07:23.895
First, you tell me
I'm not the only Carson Beckett,

07:24.015 --> 07:27.700
and then you tell me the other one
died in a horrible explosion.

07:27.860 --> 07:28.960
Oh, my God.

07:29.166 --> 07:31.037
My mother!
You didn't tell her, did you?

07:31.965 --> 07:33.081
Well, yeah.

07:33.241 --> 07:34.245
Good Lord.

07:34.504 --> 07:35.583
You were dead.

07:35.743 --> 07:37.355
I'm sorry, but we buried you.

07:37.475 --> 07:39.212
There was a memorial service.

07:39.372 --> 07:40.713
This can't be happening.

07:40.873 --> 07:42.725
- I have to talk to her.
- You can't.

07:42.845 --> 07:45.426
What kind of effect that could have?
What do you have to say to her?

07:45.586 --> 07:47.595
I'll say the Air Force
made a bloody mistake!

07:47.755 --> 07:49.514
- Carson...
- This is too much.

07:49.674 --> 07:51.641
Get Dr. Weir in here.
I need to speak to her.

07:55.144 --> 07:56.043
What?

07:57.395 --> 07:59.148
- I can't do that.
- Why not?

08:00.606 --> 08:01.776
She's dead, Carson.

08:04.566 --> 08:06.869
She was killed by the Replicators.

08:06.989 --> 08:09.131
Sacrificed herself
to save the rest of us.

08:12.264 --> 08:13.564
I'm sorry, I...

08:15.066 --> 08:17.164
I don't know what else to say.

08:18.255 --> 08:20.711
<i>You know,
for the better part of two years</i>

08:21.525 --> 08:25.525
I imagined what it would be like
the day I finally got back to Atlantis.

08:29.006 --> 08:31.399
This isn't exactly
how I pictured it.

08:41.885 --> 08:43.386
What is this place?

08:44.315 --> 08:46.012
Just another dead world.

08:46.435 --> 08:49.632
Destroyed by the Wraith,
abandoned by the survivors,

08:50.264 --> 08:51.764
forgotten by both.

08:53.024 --> 08:55.323
A perfect place to conduct my work.

08:59.535 --> 09:00.478
Open it.

09:15.223 --> 09:17.830
I'll leave you to get
re-acquainted.

09:27.563 --> 09:28.562
<i>Halling?</i>

09:39.336 --> 09:41.537
What have you got for me, Doctor?

09:41.885 --> 09:43.988
I think I've solved the mystery.

09:44.735 --> 09:46.515
You know what
a telomere is, Colonel?

09:46.635 --> 09:48.385
It's part of
a human chromosome, right?

09:48.505 --> 09:50.008
Yeah, that's right.

09:50.585 --> 09:54.485
Each time a cell divides, the chromosome
is torn apart and rebuilt,

09:54.605 --> 09:57.705
and in the process, a small amount
of the telomere gets used up.

09:57.825 --> 10:00.825
As a result,
telomeres become shorter over time.

10:01.035 --> 10:03.151
The more we age,
the shorter they get.

10:03.345 --> 10:05.146
And this is Dr. Beckett's?

10:05.615 --> 10:06.518
Yeah.

10:07.228 --> 10:08.829
<i>According to the scan,</i>

10:09.546 --> 10:11.544
his telomeres are 30% shorter

10:11.815 --> 10:14.396
than they should be
for a man of his age.

10:14.516 --> 10:16.645
The only explanation
is that the original DNA

10:16.765 --> 10:18.120
came from an adult cell.

10:18.455 --> 10:21.645
One where the telomeres
had already started to degrade.

10:21.765 --> 10:24.566
- So...
- You can forget parallel universes.

10:25.705 --> 10:26.921
He's a clone.

10:30.685 --> 10:33.185
I did not ever think
I would see you again.

10:33.305 --> 10:34.403
Nor did we.

10:35.085 --> 10:38.086
I just wish it were under
happier circumstances.

10:40.585 --> 10:42.770
Where are the rest of our people?

10:43.475 --> 10:44.777
They were taken.

10:45.735 --> 10:48.036
- Taken?
- To be experimented upon,

10:48.715 --> 10:51.279
converted into one of those...
Those things.

10:52.065 --> 10:53.595
How long has this been going on?

10:53.715 --> 10:55.616
For months.
Since the day of our arrival.

10:55.806 --> 10:57.706
Kanaan was one of the first.

10:57.875 --> 10:58.869
<i>I know.</i>

10:59.076 --> 11:00.979
I saw him on Michael's ship,

11:02.255 --> 11:05.258
but I did not realize
it had happened to so many.

11:06.055 --> 11:07.255
<i>I am so sorry.</i>

11:07.845 --> 11:10.285
<i>I should have been at the village
the day you were captured.</i>

11:10.405 --> 11:12.546
There was nothing
you could have done.

11:12.666 --> 11:16.429
50 men armed with stunners infiltrated
our village under the cover of night.

11:16.785 --> 11:19.045
We were taken
completely by surprise.

11:19.165 --> 11:21.905
These four walls have been
our prison ever since.

11:22.025 --> 11:24.221
<i>You must not abandon hope.</i>

11:24.865 --> 11:27.576
The people of Atlantis
know of my disappearance

11:27.696 --> 11:29.597
and they are looking for me.

11:29.865 --> 11:31.944
It will not be long
before they come to our rescue.

11:32.495 --> 11:34.600
That is a very pleasant thought.

11:35.835 --> 11:38.492
But until today, we held out
the same hope about you.

11:46.275 --> 11:49.571
I knew you would want
to see the results for yourself.

11:51.215 --> 11:53.714
And you're certain
it's from my sample?

11:53.935 --> 11:55.938
<i>I ran the test myself, twice.</i>

11:57.296 --> 11:58.795
<i>There's no mistake.</i>

12:00.945 --> 12:02.042
I'm sorry.

12:04.225 --> 12:05.406
It doesn't matter.

12:05.526 --> 12:07.065
That's easy for you to say,

12:07.185 --> 12:09.455
but you're not the one
who was made in a test-tube.

12:09.575 --> 12:12.485
One of the best friends I ever had
just came back from the dead.

12:12.605 --> 12:14.685
I'm not gonna quibble
over a couple of telomeres.

12:14.805 --> 12:16.555
Thank you,
but it doesn't change the fact

12:16.675 --> 12:18.933
that I'm not
the real Carson Beckett.

12:19.053 --> 12:21.846
No you're not, because the real one
wouldn't feeling sorry for himself.

12:21.966 --> 12:24.544
- He'd figure out how to help us.
- I'm willing to do whatever I can,

12:24.664 --> 12:26.965
but I'm not so sure
that my help will be wanted.

12:27.085 --> 12:28.334
Why wouldn't it be?

12:33.735 --> 12:36.786
We're talking about someone who was,
for all intents and purposes,

12:36.906 --> 12:39.315
manufactured by one of
the most dangerous individuals

12:39.435 --> 12:40.715
we've ever come across.

12:40.835 --> 12:43.075
Fundamentally, he's not
that different from those hybrids,

12:43.195 --> 12:45.795
and I doubt very much we'd be arguing
about whether we can trust them.

12:45.915 --> 12:48.416
But there's no denying the fact
that he's no ordinary clone.

12:48.536 --> 12:52.149
Michael has managed to reproduce
his memories, his thought processes,

12:52.309 --> 12:54.193
<i>and even his personality.</i>

12:54.353 --> 12:56.904
I've spent some time with him,
and I'm telling you, he's Carson.

12:57.064 --> 13:01.064
It doesn't mean it's safe to act
on any information he might give us.

13:01.455 --> 13:04.225
Look, he may genuinely believe
that he's helping us

13:04.345 --> 13:06.454
and still be playing
right into Michael's hand.

13:06.574 --> 13:07.915
<i>She's got a point, Rodney.</i>

13:08.178 --> 13:09.583
What exactly is he offering?

13:09.743 --> 13:13.016
He knows the layouts of at least
four facilities that Michael has.

13:13.136 --> 13:14.714
He likes to move around a lot,

13:14.874 --> 13:17.383
<i>- stay one step ahead of the Wraith.</i>
- What about Gate addresses?

13:17.543 --> 13:20.285
They blindfolded him every time they
moved him, so he couldn't see the DHD.

13:20.405 --> 13:23.389
Although, he did catch an address
dialed by one of Michael's mercenaries.

13:23.986 --> 13:25.891
<i>That could be a place to start.</i>

13:32.945 --> 13:35.148
Go ahead, Rodney.
I'll catch up.

13:43.845 --> 13:45.805
Is he ever going to say
a word to me?

13:45.925 --> 13:49.515
You gotta give him a break. He's not
good dealing with this sort of thing.

13:49.635 --> 13:52.675
- What sort of thing?
- You know, clones, duplicates,

13:52.795 --> 13:54.985
people coming back from the dead.

13:55.105 --> 13:56.905
We went through this with Elizabeth.

13:57.025 --> 13:59.055
Rodney told me.
It must have been difficult.

13:59.175 --> 14:01.074
- He'll come around.
- Aye.

14:08.635 --> 14:10.624
Thank you.
I must be a wee bit rusty.

14:10.744 --> 14:13.328
You're not rusty, Doc.
You were just never very good at this.

14:13.448 --> 14:14.547
Fair enough.

14:16.788 --> 14:18.238
I just want to say,

14:18.561 --> 14:20.649
thank you. For trusting me.

14:21.646 --> 14:23.296
You'll have no regrets.

14:24.139 --> 14:24.843
Doc?

14:25.114 --> 14:25.818
<i>Aye?</i>

14:26.075 --> 14:27.531
Forgot your radio.

14:27.651 --> 14:28.700
No regrets.

14:51.199 --> 14:53.098
Just in time for happy hour.

14:57.974 --> 15:01.862
I was hoping maybe you could help us.
We're looking for a friend of ours

15:02.022 --> 15:04.354
who's been known
to stop in now and then.

15:06.270 --> 15:07.915
You've come to the wrong place.

15:08.035 --> 15:09.912
We haven't even told you
what he looks like.

15:10.072 --> 15:11.362
You misunderstand me.

15:12.167 --> 15:14.434
No one here cares what he looks like.

15:14.991 --> 15:18.379
You've come to the wrong place
if you're looking for information.

15:19.596 --> 15:20.315
Look.

15:21.291 --> 15:24.749
I know you're trying to keep up
appearances here for your friends, but

15:24.869 --> 15:27.120
I think we can make it worth your while.

15:27.839 --> 15:29.139
I think it would be best

15:29.299 --> 15:31.827
<i>if you turn around and be on your way.</i>

15:39.759 --> 15:41.485
That's P-90 fire!

16:03.077 --> 16:03.924
Is he dead?

16:05.519 --> 16:07.803
No, but we need to get back
to Atlantis as soon as possible.

16:15.286 --> 16:16.347
What is it?

16:16.467 --> 16:19.690
Colonel Sheppard's team's coming back.
They've got injuries.

16:23.812 --> 16:24.714
<i>What happened?</i>

16:24.834 --> 16:26.614
This guy took a shot at us with a P-90.

16:28.149 --> 16:29.429
We're okay, but,

16:29.549 --> 16:31.925
you know, he took a little
header off the balcony.

16:32.045 --> 16:34.437
- A P-90? Where'd he get it?
- That's the question.

16:34.557 --> 16:35.873
<i>On 3. 1, 2, 3, up.</i>

16:37.307 --> 16:41.128
GSC 6, respiration 16, pulse 150,
blood pressure 70 over 50.

16:41.288 --> 16:43.349
I applied pressure
bandages at the scene.

16:43.926 --> 16:45.080
What is it?

16:45.784 --> 16:47.092
I know this man.

16:48.511 --> 16:52.123
His name's Nabel. When Teyla and
I went to New Athos, he was there.

16:52.243 --> 16:53.746
He tried to kill us.

16:53.954 --> 16:56.486
That's all right, love. He's unconscious
now, and, for the time being,

16:56.606 --> 16:58.938
in desperate need of our attention.
You can confront him later.

16:59.058 --> 17:01.834
Right now we need to save his life.
Let's go, lads.

17:08.816 --> 17:09.781
Blood pressure?

17:10.065 --> 17:11.075
50 over 40.

17:11.234 --> 17:14.286
It's dropping. We need to stop
this bleeding. I need suction.

17:14.406 --> 17:15.871
Let's prep for a C-spine X-ray.

17:18.578 --> 17:20.667
- What can I do?
- Grab some clamps and get busy.

17:20.828 --> 17:21.621
Right.

17:22.214 --> 17:24.349
I'm guessing some pretty
severe lacerations...

17:27.917 --> 17:29.299
Get him to a bed, now!

17:38.239 --> 17:40.062
It was Dr. Beckett's idea to go there.

17:40.182 --> 17:42.946
If we hadn't have gone, we wouldn't have
captured one of Michael's operatives.

17:43.066 --> 17:45.601
You also wouldn't have been
nearly killed in an ambush.

17:45.721 --> 17:47.152
<i>It wasn't that bad.</i>

17:47.434 --> 17:48.487
It was one guy.

17:48.686 --> 17:51.036
Firing at you with one
of our own weapons.

17:51.156 --> 17:53.192
He was Michael's spy
in the Athosian village.

17:53.312 --> 17:55.367
He got the P-90 from
the weapons cache we left there.

17:55.487 --> 17:58.330
It doesn't change the fact
that you were led into an ambush,

17:58.491 --> 17:59.794
<i>intentionally or not.</i>

17:59.914 --> 18:02.012
<i>Colonel Carter, this is Dr. Keller.</i>

18:02.132 --> 18:05.499
<i>You'd better come down to the infirmary.
There's a problem with Dr. Beckett.</i>

18:07.882 --> 18:11.288
After he collapsed, I did a scan
and found evidence of necrosis

18:11.408 --> 18:13.608
in several of his internal organs.

18:13.832 --> 18:17.203
His cells aren't renewing fast enough
to sustain tissue function.

18:17.323 --> 18:18.591
Any idea why?

18:18.771 --> 18:21.937
I can only assume it's a complication
due to the fact he's a clone.

18:22.603 --> 18:25.691
<i>I've given him a course of treatment
to try to stimulate cell growth,</i>

18:26.534 --> 18:29.111
but it's a bit like trying
to find a cure for old age.

18:29.421 --> 18:30.635
What are you saying?

18:31.896 --> 18:35.993
On the outside, he looks fine,
but on the inside,

18:36.891 --> 18:38.152
well, he's...

18:38.702 --> 18:39.663
he's dying.

18:46.848 --> 18:47.879
My Lord.

18:48.441 --> 18:51.832
No wonder I've felt like
a dog's breakfast ever since I got here.

18:52.370 --> 18:55.235
I'm sorry, Carson. I wish
there was something we could do.

18:55.355 --> 18:57.434
Why is this happening now?

18:57.554 --> 18:58.703
What do you mean?

18:58.823 --> 19:01.343
You survived for almost
two years with Michael.

19:01.463 --> 19:05.073
Shouldn't you have felt some kind of
effects from this condition before now?

19:05.193 --> 19:06.694
That's a good point.

19:07.347 --> 19:11.151
Don't take this the wrong way, but at
the rate your cells are deteriorating,

19:11.271 --> 19:13.625
you should have died a long time ago.

19:17.544 --> 19:19.119
The weekly injection he gave me.

19:19.607 --> 19:22.873
He said it was a sedative meant
to keep me from trying to escape,

19:23.033 --> 19:26.418
<i>but it must have been some kind of drug
to keep my cells from deteriorating.</i>

19:26.578 --> 19:28.420
You obviously don't have
any of it with you.

19:28.580 --> 19:31.730
No. Michael administered it himself,
one dose at a time,

19:31.850 --> 19:33.935
but when Colonel Sheppard's team
rescued me,

19:34.055 --> 19:36.449
it had only been four days
since my last injection.

19:36.569 --> 19:38.764
Assuming it takes a full
seven days to break down...

19:38.924 --> 19:40.532
We scanned you when you got here.

19:40.652 --> 19:41.559
Exactly.

19:41.927 --> 19:44.547
And if the scanner was able to pick it
up, we might be able to isolate it

19:44.667 --> 19:46.692
and create more.
We need to get started right now.

19:46.812 --> 19:48.947
- Where do you think you're doing?
- We have work to do.

19:49.067 --> 19:50.532
No, I have work to do.

19:50.652 --> 19:53.217
You need to stay in bed.
The less you exert yourself, the better.

19:53.337 --> 19:55.473
You don't seriously expect me
to lie here and be useless

19:55.593 --> 19:57.838
when my own life hangs
in the balance, do you?

20:13.740 --> 20:15.555
Kanaan, look at me.

20:21.135 --> 20:22.694
You know who I am.

20:23.784 --> 20:26.598
I do not know
what Michael has done to you,

20:28.551 --> 20:30.815
but I do know that, deep down,

20:31.263 --> 20:33.610
a part of you is still
the man I remember.

20:35.334 --> 20:36.837
I need your help.

20:38.788 --> 20:40.832
We need your help.

20:42.913 --> 20:45.164
If we do not find a way
out of here quickly,

20:45.973 --> 20:47.889
Michael will force on us

20:48.548 --> 20:50.345
what he has forced on you.

20:52.132 --> 20:54.717
Our child will be born soon,

20:55.276 --> 20:56.761
and when he is,

20:56.881 --> 21:00.675
Michael will take him to use
for some terrible purpose.

21:01.606 --> 21:04.619
You must not let that happen.

21:08.544 --> 21:09.893
Kanaan, wait!

21:14.108 --> 21:15.551
I'm going cross-eyed.

21:15.671 --> 21:18.160
It's gotta be in here somewhere.
We must be missing something.

21:18.280 --> 21:20.571
We've been over everything twice.
Maybe the drug breaks down

21:20.691 --> 21:22.874
- faster than we thought.
- Wait a minute.

21:23.466 --> 21:24.297
What?

21:24.671 --> 21:26.333
Unidentified polypeptide chain.

21:26.453 --> 21:29.037
The scan found it
in one of your kidney cells.

21:30.170 --> 21:32.766
Try screening it
for traces of Wraith DNA.

21:37.855 --> 21:38.926
My God.

21:39.910 --> 21:42.468
Must be a Wraith enzyme of some sort.

21:45.356 --> 21:46.915
<i>But it's enormously complex.</i>

21:47.035 --> 21:49.019
It's not gonna be easy to duplicate.

21:51.106 --> 21:52.213
Right, then.

21:59.918 --> 22:01.156
Do not incite them!

22:03.002 --> 22:05.181
- Her.
- No. You will take me instead.

22:07.294 --> 22:08.287
<i>Halling!</i>

22:15.047 --> 22:15.765
No!

22:16.771 --> 22:17.471
No!

22:18.721 --> 22:19.423
No!

22:23.096 --> 22:26.431
Just let me know when you have
test results on those. Thanks.

22:29.220 --> 22:30.220
Damn it.

22:30.971 --> 22:32.994
- What is it?
- See for yourself.

22:40.660 --> 22:43.252
The primer's not annealing
to the DNA template.

22:43.657 --> 22:46.672
There's too many contaminants.
We're back to square one.

22:46.792 --> 22:48.482
I'm sorry, Carson, but...

22:49.076 --> 22:50.842
we've only been at this
for a little while.

22:50.962 --> 22:53.077
You knew it wasn't gonna be easy.

22:53.969 --> 22:56.128
I was hoping for
a breakthrough by now.

22:57.160 --> 22:58.083
Carson?

22:58.970 --> 23:00.484
It's all right. I'm okay.

23:00.604 --> 23:03.039
No, you're not.
Your condition's getting worse.

23:03.159 --> 23:06.039
I'll be fine.
It was just a wee bit of a dizzy spell.

23:06.159 --> 23:08.390
Now, get me some
of those PCR tubes, will you?

23:08.954 --> 23:09.785
Please.

23:10.220 --> 23:11.664
You can't just ignore this.

23:11.845 --> 23:13.270
What else can I do?

23:13.470 --> 23:16.940
We could halt the deterioration
of your cells in a stasis pod.

23:17.100 --> 23:19.719
- Don't put me in one of those things.
- But it makes sense.

23:19.839 --> 23:22.487
- When I figure out how to fix this...
- What if you can't?

23:22.782 --> 23:25.114
I'll be stuck in that bloody machine
for God knows how long.

23:25.275 --> 23:27.869
Isn't that better
than trying in vain to solve this

23:27.989 --> 23:30.183
while the clock's ticking away
on your own life?

23:32.020 --> 23:32.720
No.

24:01.535 --> 24:02.535
Michael?

24:03.846 --> 24:04.935
Is that you?

24:13.222 --> 24:14.182
Kanaan.

24:17.969 --> 24:18.835
Quickly.

24:19.171 --> 24:20.698
You must release me.

24:23.418 --> 24:25.111
Michael will be here soon.

24:26.357 --> 24:29.930
He will do to me
what he has done to you. Please.

24:33.033 --> 24:34.577
I can help you escape.

24:35.957 --> 24:37.187
All of you.

24:42.274 --> 24:43.360
Teyla?

24:43.532 --> 24:44.290
Yes.

24:45.799 --> 24:46.829
It's me.

25:08.947 --> 25:09.683
Yes,

25:09.957 --> 25:11.002
that's it.

25:16.021 --> 25:16.911
Kanaan,

25:17.259 --> 25:18.285
what is it?

25:30.779 --> 25:31.575
Leave us.

25:43.157 --> 25:44.041
Now...

25:45.191 --> 25:46.498
let's get started.

26:02.043 --> 26:05.346
I see you've once again
opted to save my life.

26:05.995 --> 26:08.049
It wasn't an easy decision,
let me tell you.

26:08.169 --> 26:11.573
The only reason she did it
is because we need information.

26:11.733 --> 26:13.052
About Michael.

26:14.006 --> 26:15.258
Yes, I know.

26:16.761 --> 26:18.872
Too bad you wasted your effort.

26:19.920 --> 26:21.953
You should have just let me die.

26:22.529 --> 26:23.579
Why's that?

26:24.066 --> 26:26.545
Because once Michael finds out
I was captured,

26:26.665 --> 26:28.505
I'm as good as dead anyway.

26:28.625 --> 26:29.916
Yeah, well, maybe.

26:30.204 --> 26:32.469
Or maybe not,
if you help us find him.

26:32.629 --> 26:34.424
He has spies everywhere.

26:35.481 --> 26:38.391
There's nowhere in this galaxy
he can't find me.

26:39.168 --> 26:40.936
Who said anything about this galaxy?

26:43.955 --> 26:47.655
I had to modify this technology
for use with humans.

26:51.065 --> 26:52.183
It's crude,

26:52.647 --> 26:55.304
but it works remarkably well.

26:57.189 --> 26:58.189
Michael...

26:59.063 --> 27:02.176
Whatever has happened between us
in the past,

27:03.691 --> 27:04.852
I beg you,

27:05.398 --> 27:09.047
do not harm my child.

27:11.576 --> 27:12.759
I wouldn't dream of it.

27:13.849 --> 27:16.485
Now, just relax.

27:17.614 --> 27:19.123
This won't hurt a bit.

27:21.708 --> 27:22.519
Listen.

27:29.739 --> 27:31.285
<i>Your child is healthy.</i>

27:33.737 --> 27:34.565
Look.

27:41.441 --> 27:43.083
Why are you doing this?

27:49.188 --> 27:50.277
<i>On the ship,</i>

27:51.922 --> 27:53.025
<i>Kanaan said</i>

27:53.145 --> 27:56.851
our son would serve the cause.

27:58.064 --> 27:59.812
What did he mean by that?

28:00.536 --> 28:01.961
You have the gift.

28:02.791 --> 28:04.024
<i>So does Kanaan.</i>

28:05.836 --> 28:08.690
Have you stopped to think
what that might mean for your son?

28:10.999 --> 28:12.721
He is genetically unique.

28:13.847 --> 28:15.967
And while I've made a lot
of progress with my hybrids,

28:16.087 --> 28:18.899
there are still some details
that need to be worked out.

28:20.477 --> 28:21.645
This child...

28:22.281 --> 28:23.496
will help me do that.

28:29.175 --> 28:32.496
You've taken good care of him.
You should be very proud.

28:35.257 --> 28:36.200
Even so...

28:42.689 --> 28:44.726
He could probably use a little help.

28:46.680 --> 28:48.475
Michael, what are you doing?

28:49.013 --> 28:49.940
Please...

28:50.339 --> 28:51.798
I need this child.

28:52.990 --> 28:54.989
I can't afford to let anything...

28:55.109 --> 28:56.488
happen to him.

29:09.459 --> 29:10.638
How'd it go?

29:10.758 --> 29:13.517
Nabel gave up the address.
We know where she is.

29:15.746 --> 29:17.568
It's one of Michael's bigger facilities.

29:17.688 --> 29:21.520
The lab is in the center of the main
building, but it's difficult to find,

29:21.640 --> 29:24.875
not to mention the fact that, if he is
there, he'll be heavily guarded.

29:25.126 --> 29:27.560
- Great.
- You're sure this is the right place?

29:27.991 --> 29:29.989
I definitely recognize
the description Nabel gave.

29:30.109 --> 29:31.913
Trust me, this is the place.

29:32.440 --> 29:34.216
You should bring me with you.

29:36.246 --> 29:38.389
This is just a small part
of the complex.

29:38.509 --> 29:41.616
The place is like a maze, and once
 inside, it's easy to get turned around.

29:43.798 --> 29:45.245
All right. Thank you, Doctor.

29:51.921 --> 29:53.127
So, what do you think?

29:53.288 --> 29:55.115
Well, if he's leading us into a trap,

29:55.235 --> 29:57.805
it's not gonna make much difference
whether he's there or not.

29:57.925 --> 30:00.447
But if he isn't,
he could be pretty useful.

30:00.567 --> 30:01.970
<i>Wait a second.</i>

30:02.090 --> 30:04.769
If he goes on this mission, it could
kill him. We can't ask him to do this.

30:04.889 --> 30:07.146
- We didn't ask him. He volunteered.
- Oh, gimme a break.

30:07.266 --> 30:09.442
- Easy, Rodney.
- I'm sorry, i'm just a little concerned

30:09.562 --> 30:11.154
we're so cavalier with his life

30:11.274 --> 30:13.579
because we think of him
as some kind of a cheap copy.

30:13.699 --> 30:14.961
<i>He's doing it for Teyla.</i>

30:15.143 --> 30:16.152
Don't stand there

30:16.272 --> 30:19.727
and pretend that you wouldn't do
the same thing if you were in his place.

30:29.426 --> 30:31.993
It's okay. I'm all right.
Thank you. Okay.

30:32.454 --> 30:33.273
Carson.

30:33.393 --> 30:35.587
Rodney, I was just heading down
to get geared up.

30:36.174 --> 30:38.084
You can barely stand.
You don't have to do this.

30:38.204 --> 30:40.252
You said yourself
the real Carson wouldn't sit around

30:40.372 --> 30:42.265
worrying about himself
when he could help.

30:42.385 --> 30:44.455
The real Carson also
never listened to my advice.

30:44.575 --> 30:46.952
Look, you don't have to prove anything,
certainly not to me.

30:47.072 --> 30:48.016
I know that.

30:48.671 --> 30:50.977
Don't worry. I'll be fine.
Let's go.

31:14.166 --> 31:16.683
I'm reading a bunch
of life signs up ahead.

31:16.803 --> 31:18.021
Maybe it's the Athosians.

31:18.141 --> 31:20.876
Yeah. Or maybe it's a herd
of those Frankensteins.

31:22.417 --> 31:23.368
Doctor?

31:25.172 --> 31:26.839
It's this way, I think.

31:28.307 --> 31:30.521
No, no, I'm certain. It's this way.

31:43.451 --> 31:44.798
What is happening?

31:49.695 --> 31:52.336
There is a connection
between us, Michael,

31:52.456 --> 31:53.508
and right now,

31:53.628 --> 31:55.586
I can sense your fear.

31:56.068 --> 31:57.677
I wouldn't go that far.

31:58.214 --> 31:59.444
Let's call it...

31:59.909 --> 32:00.811
concern.

32:07.979 --> 32:09.198
What did you do?

32:09.318 --> 32:10.727
<i>I shut them down.</i>

32:12.557 --> 32:14.077
You mean you killed them.

32:14.197 --> 32:16.714
I can't afford to leave
any loose ends behind.

32:16.834 --> 32:19.764
Anyway, there's always more
where they came from.

32:21.585 --> 32:22.927
Take her to the ship.

32:23.047 --> 32:24.226
We're leaving.

32:51.690 --> 32:53.725
I'm tired of getting shot at
with our own guns.

32:55.136 --> 32:58.071
I'm not generally fond of it
regardless of the weapon.

33:09.737 --> 33:10.502
Hello?

33:11.136 --> 33:12.160
Is anyone there?

33:17.116 --> 33:18.124
<i>You must help us!</i>

33:18.892 --> 33:20.752
- You hear that?
- Was that Halling?

33:23.833 --> 33:24.779
Halling?

33:24.899 --> 33:26.537
Colonel, through here!

33:27.717 --> 33:30.553
- It's very good to see you.
- Likewise, my friend.

33:32.645 --> 33:35.469
- Are you all right?
- We're fine, those of us that are left.

33:35.589 --> 33:37.773
- Teyla said you would come.
- Where is she?

33:37.893 --> 33:39.979
Michael has taken her.
You must go after her.

33:40.395 --> 33:42.394
Take your people.
We'll meet you in a little while.

33:42.514 --> 33:45.430
Everyone, it's the time.
Come. Gather your strength.

33:45.945 --> 33:47.960
Come through.
Everyone.

33:54.277 --> 33:55.397
My God.

34:06.547 --> 34:07.507
They're dead.

34:16.456 --> 34:18.226
- You think Teyla.
- No, I don't think so,

34:18.387 --> 34:19.775
and you don't think so.

34:37.520 --> 34:40.495
I don't mean to rush things,
but I'm picking up an energy reading.

34:40.614 --> 34:42.041
Someone's firing up the ship.

34:51.020 --> 34:52.846
Carson! Carson!

35:10.975 --> 35:13.833
I know. I'm the last person
you expected to see.

35:15.718 --> 35:18.677
- It's all right. I'm here to help you.
- It's not possible.

35:18.956 --> 35:22.858
I'm sorry, I don't have time to explain.
The others are waiting back at the lab.

35:23.018 --> 35:24.951
- We have to go, now.
- I can't.

35:26.003 --> 35:29.568
Kanaan, the father of my son,
he is still here.

35:29.801 --> 35:31.249
I am not leaving without him.

35:31.509 --> 35:33.960
- There's no time.
- Quite correct.

35:35.610 --> 35:38.322
You should've run
when you had the chance,

35:38.637 --> 35:41.384
<i>but you let your feelings
get in the way.</i>

35:42.629 --> 35:44.465
Stay back.
I'm warning you.

35:45.189 --> 35:46.588
Shoot him, Carson.

35:47.369 --> 35:48.602
Shoot him now!

35:51.518 --> 35:53.563
He doesn't want to shoot me.

35:55.071 --> 35:57.608
<i>Or to be more precise,
he'd like nothing more,</i>

35:57.868 --> 35:59.784
but, like all my creations,

36:00.373 --> 36:02.321
he is open to my influence.

36:08.644 --> 36:09.912
I'm sorry, Teyla.

36:11.590 --> 36:12.665
Don't!

36:22.013 --> 36:23.301
You don't look well.

36:24.109 --> 36:25.757
<i>You should have stayed with me.</i>

36:25.931 --> 36:28.998
I'd give you an injection,
but I don't have any with me.

36:29.955 --> 36:30.955
Anyway...

36:32.409 --> 36:34.020
you've served your purpose.

36:44.237 --> 36:45.448
Time to go.

36:58.998 --> 37:00.505
Take a look, east wall.

37:00.765 --> 37:02.911
<i>Those look like gas containers?</i>

37:03.434 --> 37:04.459
Yep.

37:07.563 --> 37:08.802
Worth a shot.

37:27.322 --> 37:29.473
- Where's Beckett?
- This way.

37:38.119 --> 37:39.339
It's Carson.

37:40.330 --> 37:42.463
- What happened?
- You ran off, that's what happened.

37:44.042 --> 37:45.967
- Did you see her?
- Oh, no.

37:47.837 --> 37:50.398
- What the hell is that?
- It's the ship.

37:51.389 --> 37:52.620
- Help him.
- Yeah.

37:52.907 --> 37:53.921
Come on.

38:21.679 --> 38:23.825
We searched the place top to bottom.
No sign of her.

38:23.985 --> 38:27.071
Well, for now, we'll have to assume
she's still alive, and Michael has her.

38:27.231 --> 38:29.423
We've got prisoners.
They'll talk.

38:30.053 --> 38:31.354
We'll find her.

38:37.639 --> 38:38.726
How is he?

38:38.886 --> 38:40.667
His body's shutting down.

38:41.136 --> 38:43.516
There's nothing more
I can do for him.

38:44.265 --> 38:45.826
We can't wait any longer.

38:45.986 --> 38:48.072
Zelenka's prepping
the stasis pod.

38:48.232 --> 38:49.890
<i>I had him in my sights.</i>

38:50.791 --> 38:53.356
- All I need to do was pull the trigger.
- It's not your fault.

38:53.516 --> 38:56.691
He made you receptive to the mind link.
It's how he controls all of them...

38:56.851 --> 38:58.043
The hybrids.

38:58.415 --> 39:00.168
Would have been nice
to make a difference.

39:00.350 --> 39:02.269
You make it.
We've got Michael on the run.

39:02.429 --> 39:04.541
It's just a matter of time
before we catch up to him.

39:04.701 --> 39:06.877
- Rodney...
- Look, don't say anything, okay?

39:07.288 --> 39:09.676
It's no big deal. You're gonna go
into the stasis pod until we

39:09.836 --> 39:11.218
figure out how to fix you.

39:11.825 --> 39:13.048
I'm a doctor.

39:14.062 --> 39:15.759
I know my own prognosis.

39:17.323 --> 39:19.033
Once I go into that pod,

39:20.718 --> 39:22.647
there's a good chance
I won't come out.

39:31.918 --> 39:33.487
Right. All set.

39:51.323 --> 39:52.488
Listen,

39:53.028 --> 39:54.410
we're gonna keep working

39:54.570 --> 39:56.588
until we find a cure
for this thing.

39:56.748 --> 39:59.433
I've got a whole team on it.
Best people we have.

40:00.575 --> 40:02.853
- Thank you.
- <i>Either way, we're gonna get the cure,</i>

40:03.113 --> 40:05.106
soon as we capture Michael.

40:12.324 --> 40:13.486
Samantha,

40:14.375 --> 40:17.158
there's a letter in my quarters
addressed to my mother.

40:18.111 --> 40:20.871
Don't worry, I was careful
not to give anything away.

40:22.686 --> 40:25.768
Tell her you found it
after you shipped my things.

40:26.845 --> 40:28.563
It's just some thoughts,

40:28.868 --> 40:30.965
things I should have said
a long time ago.

40:33.003 --> 40:34.885
I'll make sure she gets it.

40:35.145 --> 40:36.153
Thank you.

40:46.136 --> 40:49.025
Don't you worry, Doc.
We're gonna have you out of there.

40:49.648 --> 40:50.702
Colonel,

40:51.450 --> 40:53.446
you bring her home now,
you understand?

40:53.824 --> 40:54.968
Count on it.

41:01.885 --> 41:04.278
This is exactly
what I was afraid of.

41:04.936 --> 41:05.958
I know, big man.

41:06.762 --> 41:07.991
I'm sorry.

41:16.601 --> 41:18.738
Right, well,
you won't feel a thing,

41:19.039 --> 41:21.932
aside from a cool burst
when the pod first activates.

41:23.134 --> 41:25.603
<i>Your life signs will be monitored on</i>

41:25.863 --> 41:27.542
this machine here 24/7.

41:30.392 --> 41:31.525
Thank you, Rodney.

41:34.288 --> 41:35.878
I want you all to know

41:37.762 --> 41:39.157
that seeing you again,

41:39.317 --> 41:40.951
<i>these last few days.</i>

41:41.522 --> 41:42.988
It was all worth it,

41:44.413 --> 41:46.123
<i>no matter what happens.</i>

41:48.885 --> 41:52.129
You know, I was toying with the idea
of programming dreams into these things.

41:52.696 --> 41:53.839
<i>Interested?</i>

41:54.099 --> 41:56.056
I could have you
fishing in the highlands...

41:56.216 --> 41:58.344
With a couple of tall,
blonde massage therapists.

41:59.135 --> 42:00.312
Rodney...

42:01.449 --> 42:02.515
I'll be fine.

42:02.775 --> 42:04.351
That's right. You will be.

42:04.511 --> 42:06.958
Because this is not goodbye,
this is

42:07.118 --> 42:08.104
<i>see you later.</i>

42:08.364 --> 42:09.855
That's what we agreed.

42:10.115 --> 42:11.148
Did we?

42:11.951 --> 42:13.484
That's how I remember it.

42:15.260 --> 42:16.595
All right, then.

42:17.331 --> 42:19.115
See you all later.
