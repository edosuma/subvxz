00:05.773 --> 00:07.406
Mail's here!

00:07.408 --> 00:11.143
Please be a "yes".

00:13.213 --> 00:14.613
Yes!

00:14.615 --> 00:16.548
She can make it!
She can make it!

00:16.550 --> 00:18.751
Going out on a limb here,
but I'm guessing that

00:18.753 --> 00:21.653
Princess cadance said she
can come this weekend.

00:21.655 --> 00:24.056
I'm finally going to get to
spend some quality time

00:24.058 --> 00:25.424
With my sister-in-law.

00:25.426 --> 00:27.426
This is the best news ever!

00:27.428 --> 00:29.094
<i>(knock at door)</i>

00:29.696 --> 00:32.531
Um, so sorry for
barging in like this.

00:32.533 --> 00:36.135
But I'm so excited I just
couldn't wait to tell somepony.

00:38.038 --> 00:40.639
The equestrian society for the
preservation of rare creatures

00:40.641 --> 00:43.509
Has given me permission to
observe the rarest, tiniest,

00:43.511 --> 00:47.279
Most adorable magical creatures
in all of equestria!

00:47.281 --> 00:49.248
The breezies!

00:49.250 --> 00:52.251
Wow, fluttershy,
that's fantastic!

00:52.253 --> 00:54.520
Oh! It's not just fantastic;

00:54.522 --> 00:57.523
It just might be
the best news ever!

00:57.525 --> 00:58.490
<i>(crash)</i>

00:58.492 --> 01:03.295
I just got the most incredible
mail anypony's ever received

01:03.297 --> 01:05.697
In all of recorded
pony postal history!

01:05.699 --> 01:10.402
It's a flyer about a one-day
sale on used patio furniture!

01:10.404 --> 01:12.438
Ah! Could this day
get any better?

01:12.440 --> 01:13.672
Whoo hoo!

02:01.221 --> 02:03.355
Here's a wrap in
case it gets cold.

02:04.591 --> 02:06.792
And I packed you a basket
of nice fresh apples

02:06.794 --> 02:08.260
In case ya git hungry!

02:08.262 --> 02:09.628
Have a great time.

02:09.630 --> 02:13.265
And I hope you have
fun with cadance!

02:20.708 --> 02:24.143
Goodbye! Goodbye, everypony!

02:24.145 --> 02:25.344
Fluttershy!

02:26.679 --> 02:29.515
I'll never
forget you!

02:34.721 --> 02:35.888
Ooh, something floaty!

02:35.890 --> 02:37.890
La la la la la.

02:37.892 --> 02:40.492
I'm a bit nervous
about cadance's visit.

02:40.494 --> 02:42.728
What could you be
nervous about, twilight?

02:42.730 --> 02:44.796
Cadance just loves
you to pieces!

02:44.798 --> 02:48.767
But I really want her visit
to go without a hitch!

02:48.769 --> 02:50.536
Why wouldn't it?

02:50.538 --> 02:52.838
Well, the last few times
we've seen each other

02:52.840 --> 02:55.607
Haven't exactly
been "worry free."

02:55.609 --> 02:57.776
The fate of equestria
has hung in the balance

02:57.778 --> 02:59.778
During most of
your visits with her.

02:59.780 --> 03:06.852
Which is why it is so important
that this visit be about

03:06.854 --> 03:09.588
The two of us having some
real quality time together.

03:09.590 --> 03:12.357
I'm guessin' you've got a
plan that'll keep it that way.

03:12.359 --> 03:14.226
The timing couldn't
be more perfect.

03:14.228 --> 03:16.895
For one day only, right
here in ponyville.

03:16.897 --> 03:19.665
The 'starswirl the
bearded' traveling museum!

03:19.667 --> 03:21.867
Cadance and I can spend
the whole day looking at

03:21.869 --> 03:23.569
Starswirl the bearded artifacts.

03:23.571 --> 03:25.437
Sounds like the
perfect, drama-free way

03:25.439 --> 03:28.941
Not counting the drama
surrounding which of the bells

03:28.943 --> 03:31.210
From his cloak they've
chosen to put on display.

03:31.212 --> 03:33.679
Spoiler alert: It's this one.

03:33.681 --> 03:35.814
<i>(gagging)</i>

03:35.816 --> 03:37.583
Uh, heh heh, sorry.

03:37.585 --> 03:41.253
Something in my throat
like a big ball of "lame?"

03:41.255 --> 03:43.288
I think it sounds delightful.

03:43.290 --> 03:45.390
Yep. Definitely sounds
like you two will have

03:45.392 --> 03:47.626
Some real quality
time together.

03:47.628 --> 03:48.660
Exactly.

03:48.662 --> 03:50.495
Just quiet time.

03:50.497 --> 03:52.598
<i>(train whistle)</i>

03:57.237 --> 03:59.504

04:09.549 --> 04:10.816
Your highness.

04:10.818 --> 04:15.254
I'm teasing, twilight.
We're sisters-in-law;

04:15.256 --> 04:16.922
We don't have to be so formal.

04:20.660 --> 04:22.427
<i>(train whistle)</i>

04:23.830 --> 04:26.398
Knowing you, you've
made some plans.

04:26.400 --> 04:29.835
Boy, have I. Hang on
just one second.

04:29.837 --> 04:33.538
Now, now, don't you
worry about a thing!

04:33.540 --> 04:36.041
We'll make sure that
nothing, but nothing,

04:36.043 --> 04:37.909
Interferes with your visit.

04:37.911 --> 04:41.413
Go on! Have a hootenanny
with your kinfolk.

04:41.415 --> 04:44.716
You really are the best friends
a pony could ever have.

04:44.718 --> 04:46.018
Coming, cadance!

04:47.920 --> 04:51.456
Ha! Two sisters-in-law bonding.

04:51.458 --> 04:53.292
Well, I for one am
gonna make sure

04:53.294 --> 04:54.593
That nothing spoils
their day.

04:54.595 --> 04:56.862

04:58.732 --> 05:00.766
Whatever it is...Duck!

05:00.768 --> 05:03.335
That doesn't look
anything like a duck!

05:04.671 --> 05:06.004
<i>(crash)</i>

05:06.839 --> 05:08.807
What is that?

05:09.876 --> 05:13.912
<i>Male voice: Not a what</i>
<i>but a "who," dear.</i>

05:13.914 --> 05:17.449
Oh, no, that sounds like...

05:17.451 --> 05:18.784
Aaaaaah-choooo!

05:21.721 --> 05:22.854
Discord!

05:28.061 --> 05:30.562
What in tarnation
are you doin' here?

05:30.564 --> 05:33.065
And why the jumpin'
junebugs are you blue?

05:33.067 --> 05:35.634
More like a shade of
cerulean, to be precise.

05:35.636 --> 05:38.670
Whatever color you are
is the color of trouble!

05:38.672 --> 05:41.540
Oh, rainbow dash,
I've changed!

05:41.542 --> 05:44.409
Surely you remember
I was reformed

05:44.411 --> 05:49.614
By lovely little fluttershy!

05:49.616 --> 05:50.716
<i>Flachoooooo!</i>

05:50.718 --> 05:51.683
<i>(crash)</i>

05:51.685 --> 05:53.752
Sick or somethin'?

05:53.754 --> 05:55.987
Well, of course I'm sick!

05:55.989 --> 05:58.056
The blue skin?

05:58.058 --> 05:59.725
These sneezes?

05:59.727 --> 06:02.094
Could somebody find
me a fainting couch?

06:05.098 --> 06:06.398
What?

06:09.635 --> 06:11.903
Charming, thank you.

06:11.905 --> 06:14.406
I can't stop sneezing
and wheezing.

06:14.408 --> 06:17.109
In short, I need help.

06:18.544 --> 06:21.780
If you're so sick, why have
you come here instead of...

06:21.782 --> 06:26.084
Y'know, staying home in bed and
getting over your weird illness?

06:26.086 --> 06:27.619
Achoo!

06:27.621 --> 06:29.688
<i>(honk)</i>

06:29.690 --> 06:32.591
Because this condition
has left me helpless.

06:32.593 --> 06:34.593
Simply helpless.

06:36.462 --> 06:39.965
Why, I can barely lift a spoon.

06:39.967 --> 06:41.400
<i>(crash)</i>

06:43.503 --> 06:46.772
I came to find the one pony
who truly understands me

06:46.774 --> 06:49.674
And could nurse me
back to health.

06:49.676 --> 06:52.077
Where is that dear,
sweet fluttershy.

06:52.079 --> 06:53.612
I need attention!

06:53.614 --> 06:55.046
I need some care!

06:55.048 --> 06:56.181
I need...

06:56.183 --> 06:58.150
You need to chill!

06:58.152 --> 06:59.718
Fluttershy's out.

06:59.720 --> 07:01.019
Oh, of course.

07:01.021 --> 07:02.954
Her trip to see the
breezies.

07:02.956 --> 07:05.524
Ah yes, I had forgotten
that was today.

07:05.526 --> 07:07.859
How do you know
about her trip?

07:07.861 --> 07:10.729
She told me about
it in her last letter.

07:12.031 --> 07:14.166
You and fluttershy write
each other letters?

07:14.168 --> 07:15.600
Of course we do.

07:15.602 --> 07:16.802
We're friends.

07:16.804 --> 07:20.172
It's just such a shame
that today of all days

07:20.174 --> 07:23.008
Is when I really need her.

07:23.010 --> 07:25.076
Oh, well. I know
what to do.

07:25.078 --> 07:27.712
Good thinking, head on
home, put your feet up.

07:27.714 --> 07:29.147
I'm sure eventually
you'll have the strength

07:29.149 --> 07:30.782
To make yourself
soup or something.

07:31.819 --> 07:37.155
I mean while she's gone, you
ponies can take care of me.

07:37.157 --> 07:39.224
Isn't that what
friends are for?

07:39.226 --> 07:41.159
Taking care of
each other?

07:42.728 --> 07:45.597
Let the healing begin!

07:45.599 --> 07:46.598
Not it!

07:46.600 --> 07:51.236
Well! That's some way to
treat a suffering friend.

07:51.238 --> 07:53.672
Achoooo!

07:53.674 --> 07:55.674
Don't you worry, discord,
I'll give you cuddles

07:55.676 --> 07:57.943
And read stories and
tell you all about me!

07:57.945 --> 07:59.644
I was born on a Tuesday....

07:59.646 --> 08:01.980
You're so sweet to offer.

08:01.982 --> 08:04.015
But rarity and applejack
already volunteered

08:04.017 --> 08:06.885
To be my own personal
nursemaids!

08:06.887 --> 08:08.954
We did?

08:08.956 --> 08:12.023
I so hope you don't
mind, pinkie pie.

08:12.025 --> 08:14.659
Well, as a matter of
fact, I most certainly...

08:14.661 --> 08:19.865
Hey! Who keeps throwing away
these perfectly good balloons?

08:19.867 --> 08:24.069
And whatever it is, we're
gonna keep it as far away

08:24.071 --> 08:25.937
From twilight and princess
cadance as possible.

08:25.939 --> 08:28.874
<i>(beeps)</i>

08:28.876 --> 08:32.544
We promised we wouldn't let
anything ruin their visit.

08:32.546 --> 08:34.846
Although I do so wish that
"anything" had turned out

08:34.848 --> 08:36.681
To be something else.

08:36.683 --> 08:40.018
Did I hear you two talking about
princess cadance's visit

08:40.020 --> 08:42.521
With princess twilight?

08:42.523 --> 08:44.089
Maybe.

08:44.091 --> 08:46.057
Fluttershy had mentioned
that those two

08:46.059 --> 08:47.893
Were getting together today.

08:47.895 --> 08:49.961
How wonderful for them both.

08:49.963 --> 08:52.964
It is so rare that those two
get to see one another.

08:52.966 --> 08:55.300
I don't know about you, but I
sometimes wonder how close

08:55.302 --> 09:00.772
<i>All those years apart</i>
<i>before being reunited?</i>

09:00.774 --> 09:02.641
They're plenty close.

09:02.643 --> 09:04.876
And if they're not, this rare
opportunity to focus

09:04.878 --> 09:07.779
On their friendship will
certainly bring them closer.

09:07.781 --> 09:11.316
They mustn't be disturbed.

09:11.318 --> 09:12.751
Disturb them?

09:12.753 --> 09:16.555
Not when I have two such
dear friends of my own

09:16.557 --> 09:18.757
Who have already offered
to take care of me.

09:18.759 --> 09:20.959
And at such peril.

09:20.961 --> 09:24.763
This flu of mine is highly...

09:24.765 --> 09:25.864
Aaaachoo!

09:25.866 --> 09:27.165
Contagious.

09:29.835 --> 09:31.169
Aaaaahhhhhchooo!

09:31.171 --> 09:35.674
Oh no! I've gotten
you both sick.

09:35.676 --> 09:40.178
Whomever shall I turn to
now in my time of need?

09:40.180 --> 09:42.681
<i>(evil chuckle)</i>

09:44.116 --> 09:47.152

09:47.154 --> 09:48.787
What could be better?

09:48.789 --> 09:50.822
Absolutely nothing!

09:52.358 --> 09:54.793
Is that the candlestick
he used to light the way

09:54.795 --> 09:56.828
When he was exploring the
caverns of maretania?

09:56.830 --> 10:00.966
I can't believe I'm getting
to see it in real life!

10:11.777 --> 10:14.613
Discord! What are
you doing here?

10:14.615 --> 10:20.218
Oh, dear, dear princesses,
I'm sorry to say I'm sick.

10:20.220 --> 10:22.721
<i>(coug)</i>

10:22.723 --> 10:24.155
Blue flu.

10:24.157 --> 10:29.294
I fear I've already given it
to poor applejack and rarity.

10:32.632 --> 10:33.898
Achoo!

10:34.800 --> 10:36.234
Magic health bubble.

10:36.236 --> 10:37.702
Good thinking.

10:37.704 --> 10:40.271
How would twilight
nurse me back to health

10:40.273 --> 10:42.340
If she was sick, too?

10:42.342 --> 10:44.342
You will be letting
me stay at your place

10:44.344 --> 10:46.111
Until I'm all
better, won't you?

10:46.113 --> 10:47.278
Stay?

10:47.280 --> 10:48.747
With me?

10:48.749 --> 10:51.149
Uh, now is not
really the best time.

10:51.151 --> 10:53.351
Though I'm sure you
already knew that.

10:53.353 --> 10:55.854
But taking in the sick
and the desperate:

10:55.856 --> 10:58.056
Isn't that what
fluttershy would do?

10:58.058 --> 11:01.760
Isn't "helping" something
that friends do for friends?

11:03.730 --> 11:07.265
You're really saying that
you're not my friend.

11:10.136 --> 11:12.270
No. That is not
what I'm saying.

11:12.272 --> 11:15.206
Oh, how elated I
am to hear that.

11:15.208 --> 11:18.276
Shall the three of us
head back to your place?

11:18.278 --> 11:20.979
I don't want to get
anypony else sick.

11:20.981 --> 11:23.114
(sigh)I guess we
don't have much choice.

11:24.750 --> 11:25.984
Carry me?

11:25.986 --> 11:27.318
<i>(clatter)</i>

11:27.320 --> 11:28.887
It isn't far.

11:28.889 --> 11:31.056
I think you can manage.

11:31.058 --> 11:32.057
Oh.

11:37.997 --> 11:39.898
Need anything else?

11:39.900 --> 11:42.133
Just knowing that I have
a good friend like you

11:42.135 --> 11:46.271
To take care of me has
made me feel better already.

11:46.273 --> 11:49.040
I'll be fine here on my own.

11:51.143 --> 11:53.845
Oh. Just before you go.

11:53.847 --> 11:56.948
Just a little, small request.

11:58.217 --> 11:59.384
<i>(sigh)</i>

11:59.386 --> 12:01.052
It's going to be fine.

12:01.054 --> 12:02.487
We'll just get him
what he wants

12:02.489 --> 12:04.823
And be back to the
exhibit in no time.

12:05.726 --> 12:09.728
<i>â™ª a little glass of</i>
<i>water, please? â™ª</i>

12:09.730 --> 12:11.996
<i>â™ª a fresh-pressed</i>
<i>hankie if I sneeze? â™ª</i>

12:11.998 --> 12:14.232
<i>â™ª some tea with honey</i>
<i>from the bees â™ª</i>

12:14.234 --> 12:16.434
<i>â™ª whenever you can brew it</i>

12:16.436 --> 12:22.440
â™ª and while I get a little rest
<i>a teeny tiny small request â™ª</i>

12:22.442 --> 12:27.011
â™ª some codfish oil for my chest
<i>poured from a crystal cruet â™ª</i>

12:27.013 --> 12:32.283
<i>â™ª I need a vat of</i>
<i>pumpkin soup â™ª</i>

12:32.285 --> 12:37.756
<i>â™ª or something shiny</i>
<i>of that ilk, â™ª</i>

12:37.758 --> 12:43.027
<i>â™ª and since my stomach's</i>
<i>feeling crummy, â™ª</i>

12:43.029 --> 12:48.299
â™ª and a slice of homemade rye

12:48.301 --> 12:52.971
<i>â™ª more basil; I need oodles</i>

12:52.973 --> 12:57.776
<i>â™ª I'll be grateful for</i>
<i>your charity â™ª</i>

12:57.778 --> 13:01.012
<i>â™ª until the bitter end</i>

13:01.014 --> 13:04.349
<i>â™ª because I've heard</i>
<i>that tenderness â™ª</i>

13:04.351 --> 13:08.019
<i>â™ª is what you lend</i>
<i>an ailing friend â™ª</i>

13:08.021 --> 13:10.822
Tenderness; isn't
that right, friend?

13:10.824 --> 13:14.826
So! Who's ready for
my big reprise?

13:14.828 --> 13:20.098
<i>â™ª a fresh boquet of roses.</i>

13:20.100 --> 13:25.570
<i>â™ª a wig to keep</i>
<i>me from the breeze, â™ª</i>

13:31.044 --> 13:36.314
<i>â™ª a goat on skis!</i>
<i>A new trapeze! â™ª</i>

13:40.319 --> 13:42.120
And just because I oughta...

13:42.122 --> 13:44.923
<i>â™ª make sure I'm</i>
<i>drinking in the right â™ª</i>

13:44.925 --> 13:46.891
<i>â™ª amount of fluids</i>
<i>day and night â™ª</i>

13:46.893 --> 13:48.293
â™ª I wish I may, I wish I might

13:48.295 --> 13:50.094
<i>â™ª have just one little thing</i>

13:50.096 --> 13:59.237
<i>â™ª me that tiny glass</i>
<i>of water? â™ª</i>

13:59.239 --> 14:00.338
<i>(thud)</i>

14:00.340 --> 14:02.207
<i>(cough)</i>

14:07.479 --> 14:08.479
<i>(smash)</i>

14:08.481 --> 14:10.181
Oops. Sorry.

14:10.183 --> 14:11.983
Achoo!

14:11.985 --> 14:13.551
All right. This
is ridiculous.

14:13.553 --> 14:16.054
How did you even
catch this flu?

14:16.056 --> 14:18.156
Inadequate hoof
and claw washing?

14:18.158 --> 14:20.158
There must be some
way to just cure you.

14:20.160 --> 14:23.228
There has to be a spell or
a remedy in one of my books.

14:23.230 --> 14:25.230
<i>Discord: There is one way!</i>

14:25.232 --> 14:28.466
And you didn't think to
mention it earlier?

14:28.468 --> 14:30.568
Slipped my mind.

14:30.570 --> 14:33.204
<i>On a hill at the very</i>
<i>edge of equestria,</i>

14:33.206 --> 14:36.274
<i>There grows an</i>
<i>exquisite magic flower.</i>

14:36.276 --> 14:39.878
<i>Pick the flower as it</i>
<i>drops its petals at sunset.</i>

14:39.880 --> 14:42.080
<i>Then you can make a</i>
<i>magical, soothing elixir</i>

14:42.082 --> 14:44.382
<i>To cure the blue flu.</i>

14:46.385 --> 14:48.653
I suppose you have a good
reason you didn't bother

14:48.655 --> 14:51.923
As soon as you
realized you were sick?

14:51.925 --> 14:54.492
Well, I couldn't travel
that far in my condition.

14:54.494 --> 14:56.661
By the time I got
there, I'd be too weak

14:56.663 --> 14:59.030
To even attempt to
retrieve the flower.

15:00.232 --> 15:03.101
So where exactly are
cadance and I headed?

15:03.103 --> 15:07.639
Well, you want to head north,
turn left at the--oh.

15:07.641 --> 15:10.208
You know, it would
be much easier

15:10.210 --> 15:12.377
If I took you
there myself.

15:12.379 --> 15:16.080
I thought you were in
"no condition" to travel.

15:16.082 --> 15:17.015
<i>(poof)</i>

15:17.017 --> 15:19.918
We'll need to make
some arrangements.

15:19.920 --> 15:21.052
<i>(chuckle)</i>

15:24.957 --> 15:27.625
â™ª

15:27.627 --> 15:29.494
<i>(gasping)</i>

15:29.496 --> 15:33.464
To be honest, I'm a
little out of practice

15:33.466 --> 15:37.535
<i>Discord: Well! Then lucky</i>
<i>for you, we're here.</i>

15:37.537 --> 15:41.039
â™ª

15:41.041 --> 15:42.573
<i>(thud)</i>

15:42.575 --> 15:44.409
It's just at the
top of that hill.

15:44.411 --> 15:49.180
â™ª

15:49.182 --> 15:50.648
I'm really sorry
about this.

15:50.650 --> 15:53.051
All I wanted was for us
to have some peaceful,

15:53.053 --> 15:57.255
I know. I was looking
forward to it, too.

15:57.957 --> 15:59.357
<i>(eagle screech)</i>

16:02.628 --> 16:03.995
This is the top.

16:03.997 --> 16:05.396
But where's that flower?

16:14.273 --> 16:15.273
Oh.

16:15.275 --> 16:18.509
If we hurry, we can still
have some time together.

16:20.112 --> 16:23.514
<i>(cracking)</i>

16:23.516 --> 16:25.550
<i>(rumbling)</i>

16:25.552 --> 16:28.052
One last pull.

16:30.055 --> 16:31.389
<i>(crash)</i>

16:33.025 --> 16:36.194
Whew! Let's get discord and
this flower back home,

16:36.196 --> 16:37.495
Then all our problems...

16:37.497 --> 16:39.063
What in equestria?

16:39.065 --> 16:42.700
<i>(rumbling and crash)</i>

16:48.240 --> 16:49.707
<i>(roar)</i>

16:49.709 --> 16:51.309
<i>(screams)</i>

16:51.311 --> 16:53.644
<i>(screeches)</i>

17:00.686 --> 17:03.121
Twilight! Help!

17:03.123 --> 17:05.723
Get your coils off
my sister-in-law!

17:10.030 --> 17:11.796
<i>(roar)</i>

17:11.798 --> 17:13.097
Aaahh!

17:13.766 --> 17:15.800
<i>(scream)</i>

17:17.636 --> 17:20.238
Let go of my sister-in-law!

17:21.707 --> 17:22.807
Thanks!

17:22.809 --> 17:24.308
Don't thank me yet!

17:24.310 --> 17:25.710
<i>(roar)</i>

17:25.712 --> 17:27.278
<i>(gasp)</i>

17:27.280 --> 17:28.179
<i>(snap)</i>

17:30.149 --> 17:31.082
<i>(thud)</i>

17:32.351 --> 17:35.186
<i>(zaps and screeches)</i>

17:35.188 --> 17:37.755
Just a little more.

17:37.757 --> 17:40.625
<i>(roar)</i>

17:40.627 --> 17:42.360
And for good measure.

17:44.463 --> 17:45.430
<i>(crash)</i>

17:48.734 --> 17:50.234
Are you ok?

17:50.236 --> 17:54.305
Yes. Better than
ok, actually.

17:54.307 --> 17:56.307
Then let's get discord
back to ponyville,

17:56.309 --> 17:58.276
Make that elixir, and
finally get a chance

17:58.278 --> 18:00.411
To spend some quality
time together!

18:04.616 --> 18:06.517
<i>Discord: To the ends</i>
<i>of equestria!</i>

18:06.519 --> 18:09.187
To face such great danger!

18:09.189 --> 18:12.090
And she did it for me.
She did it all for me!

18:12.092 --> 18:13.724
For me! For me!

18:13.726 --> 18:15.560
<i>(laughter)</i>

18:19.565 --> 18:20.765
You...

18:20.767 --> 18:21.799
Were...

18:21.801 --> 18:22.867
Faking?

18:22.869 --> 18:24.302
I was.

18:24.304 --> 18:26.237
But I had a very
good reason.

18:27.272 --> 18:28.873
We're listening.

18:28.875 --> 18:31.609
Well, I was in my
thinking tree.

18:31.611 --> 18:34.779
That's where I do most of
my really deep thinking.

18:34.781 --> 18:37.148
I was there and I
said to myself I said.

18:37.150 --> 18:40.685
Discord, your friend twilight
says that she's your pal,

18:40.687 --> 18:44.455
But she never writes and she
never pops in for a visit.

18:44.457 --> 18:46.257
I don't even know
where you live.

18:46.259 --> 18:48.126
Now that she's a princess,

18:48.128 --> 18:51.129
<i>Maybe she's decided that</i>
<i>she's too good for you.</i>

18:51.131 --> 18:52.864
I have never considered
myself too good--

18:52.866 --> 18:54.499
But how was I supposed to know

18:54.501 --> 18:57.401
For sure that I'm
truly still friends

18:57.403 --> 18:59.704
With one of the most
important ponies around?

18:59.706 --> 19:03.741
By seeing if you would go
to the ends of equestria

19:03.743 --> 19:05.843
For me, of course!

19:05.845 --> 19:07.812
Which you did. Literally.

19:07.814 --> 19:12.683
Congratulations, twilight,
you passed my friendship test!

19:15.220 --> 19:16.220
<i>(clang)</i>

19:19.424 --> 19:21.192
Why the angry eyes?

19:21.194 --> 19:22.927
You love passing tests.

19:22.929 --> 19:25.696
It's not because my little exam
put a damper on your visit

19:25.698 --> 19:27.565
With princess cadance, is it?

19:27.567 --> 19:29.901
Made it so that there was
no time for you two

19:29.903 --> 19:32.870
To focus on <i>your</i> friendship?

19:32.872 --> 19:35.840
You didn't put a damper
on our visit at all.

19:35.842 --> 19:39.810
Spending the day at the
starswirl the bearded exhibit

19:39.812 --> 19:42.947
Would have been more
relaxing, but to be honest,

19:42.949 --> 19:45.683
Relaxation is the
last thing I need.

19:45.685 --> 19:46.717
It is?

19:46.719 --> 19:50.721
Life in the crystal
empire is wonderful,

19:50.723 --> 19:54.625
But it's become a
little... Predictable.

19:54.627 --> 19:57.662
I enjoy a little
excitement now and then.

19:57.664 --> 19:59.630
Getting to face all
these challenges today

19:59.632 --> 20:01.499
Was just what I needed.

20:01.501 --> 20:04.669
And facing them with you just
made me realize even more

20:04.671 --> 20:07.805
How lucky I am to have
somepony like you as a friend.

20:11.476 --> 20:13.311
We may not see each
other very often,

20:13.313 --> 20:16.614
But I know you'll always
be there when I need you.

20:16.616 --> 20:18.883
Just like she was
there for you, discord.

20:18.885 --> 20:20.618
Yes. She's a
real sweetheart.

20:20.620 --> 20:22.887
We're all so lucky to
have her in our lives.

20:22.889 --> 20:24.455
<i>(rumbling)</i>

20:24.457 --> 20:25.756
<i>(crash)</i>

20:26.825 --> 20:28.359
<i>(screech)</i>

20:28.361 --> 20:29.694
What in the world?

20:32.397 --> 20:33.631
<i>(splat)</i>

20:41.473 --> 20:43.874
<i>Twilight: I think it's pretty</i>
<i>clear that my visit with cadance</i>

20:43.876 --> 20:46.544
Didn't go quite the
way I expected.

20:46.546 --> 20:49.513
But in the end, I realized that
when you're with a good friend,

20:49.515 --> 20:52.583
Even the most chaotic day can
end up being a great experience

20:52.585 --> 20:54.385
That brings you closer.

20:54.387 --> 20:56.587
Wouldn't you agree, discord?

20:56.589 --> 20:59.323
Yes, twilight.

20:59.325 --> 21:01.826
I don't wanna go sayin'
you got what you deserved.

21:01.828 --> 21:04.528
Well, I have no
trouble saying it.

21:04.530 --> 21:06.030
You got what you
deserved!

21:06.032 --> 21:07.398
Now, now.

21:07.400 --> 21:11.502
Isn't that right,
my little patient?

21:11.504 --> 21:14.372
I'm so glad that you're back
from your trip, fluttershy.

21:14.374 --> 21:17.575
Just your presence here is
making me feel so much better.

21:18.844 --> 21:20.544
I was just wondering.

21:20.546 --> 21:23.347
Could I trouble you for
just one more thing?

21:23.349 --> 21:24.749
No!

21:24.751 --> 21:24.782
I was simply going to ask for
a teeny tiny glass of water.
