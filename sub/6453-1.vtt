00:28.482 --> 00:30.643
<i>Holly, you've gotta open up.</i>

00:31.251 --> 00:33.378
<i>I'm not so sure about this.</i>

00:34.654 --> 00:37.020
<i>Come on open the door,</i>
<i>tough guy.</i>

00:37.390 --> 00:38.755
<i>Okay.</i>

00:41.561 --> 00:44.155
You look awesome. Turn.

00:44.765 --> 00:47.529
I cannot believe that you talked
me into going to the dance.

00:47.601 --> 00:50.092
I thought you said you've been
to like, a million schools.

00:50.170 --> 00:53.333
Schools, a million.
Dances, zero.

00:58.779 --> 00:59.939
I'll get it.

01:00.013 --> 01:01.071
Go.

01:07.587 --> 01:10.385
It's a simple matter
of self-preservation.

01:10.457 --> 01:11.981
I mean,
when you move around a lot...

01:12.058 --> 01:14.959
you just don't let yourself
get attached.

01:15.028 --> 01:17.553
Much less, make plans
to go to school dances.

01:17.631 --> 01:20.259
I hate to break it to you,
but in exactly one week...

01:20.333 --> 01:23.029
your streak is
officially going to end.

01:29.709 --> 01:31.472
Maybe you're right.

01:33.880 --> 01:35.040
Surprise!

01:36.716 --> 01:38.843
Come in.
- Jean.

01:39.986 --> 01:41.351
We need to talk.

01:43.657 --> 01:44.646
What?

01:44.858 --> 01:45.882
Jean.

01:45.959 --> 01:48.086
Why? How could you?
- Jean.

01:48.261 --> 01:49.454
Wait, don't you "Jean" me.

01:49.455 --> 01:51.059
Just calm down.
Please, calm down.

01:51.131 --> 01:52.564
We can be civilized
about this.

01:52.632 --> 01:54.031
I'll be right back.

01:54.100 --> 01:55.397
Civilized?

01:55.468 --> 01:57.629
Just calm down.
- No, why are you telling me this?

01:57.704 --> 01:59.934
Are you in love with her?
- She meant nothing to me.

02:00.006 --> 02:02.065
Well, technically,
they meant nothing to me.

02:02.142 --> 02:03.268
"They"?

02:03.343 --> 02:04.708
"They?"

02:04.778 --> 02:07.303
Look on the bright side.
It's out of my system.

02:11.017 --> 02:12.609
Have a nice day.

02:21.995 --> 02:23.986
Explain this
to me again.

02:26.399 --> 02:27.661
Patsy's back.

02:27.734 --> 02:29.395
It's packing time.

02:30.203 --> 02:32.728
Does this mean you're
not going to the dance?

02:32.806 --> 02:35.331
We'll be gone
by the end of the week.

02:36.643 --> 02:38.406
I'll stay in touch.

02:40.213 --> 02:41.271
Bye.

02:42.215 --> 02:43.739
I'll miss you.

02:57.230 --> 02:59.425
Where are we going
this time?

02:59.799 --> 03:02.859
There's a spot open
at Dolores' bakery.

03:03.036 --> 03:04.901
You know, I've always
wanted to go there...

03:04.971 --> 03:06.495
and you kids
will love Brooklyn.

03:06.573 --> 03:09.098
It's time
for a new adventure and...

03:11.778 --> 03:13.439
I'm sorry, honey.

03:14.180 --> 03:17.343
I know you were finally
making some friends here.

03:17.417 --> 03:19.009
It's no biggie.

03:19.586 --> 03:22.180
There's friends everywhere.
Right?

03:36.369 --> 03:39.566
<i> Hey, all you bloggers.</i>
<i>It's me: Girl on the Move.</i>

03:40.073 --> 03:41.768
<i>Well, here's a big shocker.</i>

03:41.841 --> 03:45.436
<i>My mom got her heart broken.</i>
<i>Again.</i>

03:47.147 --> 03:50.344
<i>Yep, we're starting off</i>
<i>on another big adventure.</i>

03:50.817 --> 03:53.445
<i>That's my mom's word</i>
<i>for running away.</i>

03:54.421 --> 03:57.117
"T-I-C" Tic.

03:57.524 --> 03:58.684
Trick.

03:59.993 --> 04:01.085
Stick.

04:02.595 --> 04:04.392
Come on,
little Miss Mary Sunshine.

04:04.464 --> 04:07.228
Play the game. Give us
a word with "tic" in it.

04:07.300 --> 04:08.358
Fine.

04:10.070 --> 04:11.264
Tragic.

04:11.538 --> 04:12.903
Fantastic.

04:13.373 --> 04:14.635
Pathetic.

04:17.711 --> 04:18.973
Ecstatic.

04:19.546 --> 04:20.637
Thank you.

04:20.714 --> 04:22.079
Sarcastic.

04:22.282 --> 04:23.544
Psychotic.

04:23.616 --> 04:25.083
It's genetic.

04:31.624 --> 04:32.682
<i>By some miracle...</i>

04:32.759 --> 04:35.319
<i>my mom only got one speeding
ticket the whole way.</i>

04:35.395 --> 04:37.363
It's Miss Jean Hamilton.

04:37.797 --> 04:39.059
Are you married?

04:39.132 --> 04:42.363
<i> He should write her a ticket</i>
<i>for reckless flirting.</i>

04:51.711 --> 04:52.973
Wow!

04:56.216 --> 04:57.774
<i>I will say one thing, though.</i>

04:57.851 --> 04:59.785
<i>For those of you</i>
<i>who haven't done it yet...</i>

04:59.853 --> 05:01.548
<i>put "Must see</i>
<i>New York skyline"...</i>

05:01.621 --> 05:04.089
<i>on your list of things</i>
<i>to do before you die.</i>

05:29.816 --> 05:31.044
Oh, wow!

05:33.887 --> 05:35.320
Oh, girls!

05:35.388 --> 05:38.915
I bet it's full of quaint details,
pretty moldings on the ceilings...

05:38.992 --> 05:40.983
and old hardwood floors.

05:41.061 --> 05:44.553
And charming little rat
droppings in the breakfast nook.

05:44.631 --> 05:46.565
How delightful.
- Cut it out.

05:46.633 --> 05:48.624
It's going to be perfect.

05:52.639 --> 05:55.506
<i>The sad thing is,</i>
<i>I'm actually getting good at this.</i>

05:55.575 --> 05:58.043
<i>If all else fails, I have a very</i>
<i>promising future...</i>

05:58.111 --> 06:00.079
<i>as a professional mover.</i>

06:00.980 --> 06:03.676
<i>Our new apartment has history</i>
<i>and character.</i>

06:03.750 --> 06:06.514
<i>And exotic local wildlife.</i>

06:09.789 --> 06:10.881
<i>My mom calls it home.</i>

06:10.957 --> 06:13.687
<i>I call it the</i>
<i>Witness Relocation Program.</i>

06:18.998 --> 06:20.295
Mommy, look!

06:20.366 --> 06:22.027
There it is.
- I told you.

06:22.102 --> 06:23.899
The same one
as in Wichita.

06:23.970 --> 06:26.234
It still comes out
every night.

06:26.306 --> 06:28.103
Even in hard times.

06:28.508 --> 06:31.602
To remind us that every day
holds the potential for beauty.

06:38.384 --> 06:40.147
<i> It's getting late,</i>
<i>and I'm wiped.</i>

06:40.220 --> 06:42.154
<i>So, time to hit the sheets.</i>

06:42.222 --> 06:45.316
<i>Even though I have no idea</i>
<i>which box they're in.</i>

06:46.059 --> 06:48.425
<i>Keep reading my on-line journal</i>
<i>for more days...</i>

06:48.495 --> 06:51.555
<i>in the life of a teenage gypsy.</i>
<i>I'll be here.</i>

06:52.298 --> 06:54.960
<i>The same me,</i>
<i>just a different zip code.</i>

07:39.245 --> 07:42.180
No! That's it! I'm not going.
You go with him.

07:42.248 --> 07:43.681
Sorry.

07:45.685 --> 07:47.653
Check her out.
- Hey, you.

07:47.720 --> 07:49.051
Yeah, you.

07:50.023 --> 07:51.615
How much your kicks
cost you?

07:51.691 --> 07:53.056
What?

07:53.626 --> 07:55.594
I paid $50 for mine.

07:55.795 --> 07:57.456
You?
- Free.

07:57.530 --> 08:00.499
I pulled them out of a garbage
can somewhere in Portland.

08:00.567 --> 08:01.829
You win.

08:02.602 --> 08:04.092
See you, freak.

08:04.470 --> 08:06.631
Hey, you're new here?

08:06.706 --> 08:08.936
Yeah, how'd you know?
- Your skin.

08:09.008 --> 08:11.203
My skin looks new?
- It looks virgin.

08:11.277 --> 08:13.507
No piercing, no tats.

08:13.680 --> 08:17.013
See, us Brooklyn girls, we lose
our skin virginity by fifth grade.

08:17.083 --> 08:20.280
In fifth grade, I was just
learning long division.

08:21.888 --> 08:23.549
<i>Attention, all students.</i>

08:23.623 --> 08:25.648
<i>Check in with your</i>
<i>homeroom monitor each day...</i>

08:25.725 --> 08:26.714
That stinks.

08:26.793 --> 08:28.852
You're going to have to
take your yearbook photo...

08:28.928 --> 08:31.055
with all the losers who
missed it in the fall.

08:31.130 --> 08:32.597
I don't do yearbook photos.

08:32.664 --> 08:34.131
You have no choice.

08:34.200 --> 08:35.724
It's like taxes
and death.

08:35.802 --> 08:38.100
Mandatory pain. If you
don't do it yourself...

08:38.171 --> 08:40.639
they'll hunt you down like an
animal and force you to smile.

08:40.707 --> 08:42.607
Not if I'm not here anymore,
they won't.

08:45.111 --> 08:47.477
I'm so glad you came.
- Thanks.

08:47.547 --> 08:49.174
Now, we keep the mixers
in the back.

08:49.249 --> 08:51.717
But I got to warn you,
they're all older than God.

08:51.784 --> 08:53.251
They don't really
mix very well...

08:53.319 --> 08:54.843
they just kind of move
things around.

08:54.921 --> 08:57.685
So I hope your manual
mixer's in real good shape.

08:57.757 --> 08:59.884
And watch out
for our no-good oven.

08:59.959 --> 09:01.654
It's worse than that one
in Chapel Hill.

09:01.728 --> 09:03.127
Off by a good 10 degrees.

09:03.196 --> 09:04.390
Well, you know me.

09:04.464 --> 09:07.456
I'm off by way more than that.
- Yes, you are.

09:07.767 --> 09:10.736
And this is Gloria.
Gloria, this is Jean...

09:10.803 --> 09:13.363
the one I was telling you about.
- Really nice to meet you.

09:13.439 --> 09:14.701
Likewise.

09:15.174 --> 09:17.335
Do you know anything
about wilting rose petals?

09:17.410 --> 09:18.741
The fondant's too soft.

09:18.811 --> 09:20.779
You need to add
more cornstarch.

09:20.847 --> 09:22.678
See, I told you she was good.

09:22.749 --> 09:24.842
No wonder my rum cakes
always look so drunk.

09:24.917 --> 09:26.976
Help me. I like you.

09:29.355 --> 09:31.084
You never eat the cakes?

09:31.924 --> 09:34.415
You made it on time?
- Yeah, I'm here.

09:35.428 --> 09:37.191
<i>Attention, all students.</i>

09:37.263 --> 09:39.458
<i>Talent show auditions</i>
<i>will take place...</i>

09:39.532 --> 09:42.000
<i>this Friday evening</i>
<i>in the auditorium.</i>

09:42.068 --> 09:44.593
<i>Come on out</i>
<i>and show us what you got.</i>

09:51.644 --> 09:53.168
That's my seat.

09:53.880 --> 09:55.575
Is there assigned seating?

09:56.282 --> 09:58.910
No, but...
- Why don't you take one of those?

09:59.719 --> 10:02.153
I don't like sitting up front.

10:02.622 --> 10:04.021
Me, neither.

10:29.716 --> 10:31.479
Isn't it big?

10:31.551 --> 10:33.883
It's gorgeous!
- It's so heavy.

10:33.953 --> 10:36.319
I need a crane
to lift my finger.

10:36.756 --> 10:38.485
Well, baby,
if he's any good at all...

10:38.558 --> 10:40.685
you'll never have to lift
a finger again.

10:40.760 --> 10:42.455
I'm so glad
I listened to you.

10:42.528 --> 10:43.586
He was a customer.

10:43.663 --> 10:45.563
Dolores coached me
through the whole thing.

10:45.631 --> 10:48.862
When to give him an extra
doughnut, when to hold back.

10:48.935 --> 10:51.665
You never told me that.
- I told you.

10:51.738 --> 10:53.467
You just didn't
want to listen.

10:53.539 --> 10:55.302
So I've had a few
bad relationships.

10:55.375 --> 10:57.366
Honey, if ex-boyfriends
were dollars...

10:57.443 --> 10:58.432
you'd be loaded by now.

10:58.511 --> 10:59.944
Now, baby,
what you gotta do is...

11:00.012 --> 11:02.742
Mom, what you gotta do
is sign my enrollment form.

11:02.815 --> 11:04.180
4:00 already?

11:04.250 --> 11:06.377
Girls, this is
my daughter, Holly.

11:06.452 --> 11:07.680
Hi.
- I'm going to get my purse.

11:07.754 --> 11:09.722
Look at you!
All grown up.

11:09.789 --> 11:12.349
Got your little speed bumps
and everything.

11:12.425 --> 11:14.154
Welcome to Brooklyn, Holly.

11:14.227 --> 11:15.558
See you girls tomorrow.

11:15.628 --> 11:18.028
Don't embarrass her.
- I've known her for so long.

11:18.097 --> 11:19.428
So, tell me. How was it?

11:19.499 --> 11:21.126
It was good.
- Tell me more.

11:21.200 --> 11:24.067
Excuse me, real quick,
I was just, I was over here.

11:24.137 --> 11:26.901
I was just wondering,
did it hurt at all?

11:27.540 --> 11:28.666
Did what hurt?

11:28.741 --> 11:31.437
When you fell.
You know, from heaven.

11:31.511 --> 11:33.536
'Cause I was just thinking
with a face like that...

11:33.613 --> 11:35.171
you gotta be an angel, right?

11:37.250 --> 11:39.480
Has that line
ever worked for you?

11:39.552 --> 11:42.248
Well, I got you to laugh,
right? That's Step One.

11:42.321 --> 11:45.222
I'm Lenny Horton.
I'm the bread manager.

11:45.291 --> 11:47.054
I make, you know, the bread.

11:47.126 --> 11:49.856
We got Italian bread,
French bread, bulky rolls...

11:49.929 --> 11:52.693
different kinds
of kaiser rolls, pita bread.

11:52.765 --> 11:54.096
You like pita bread?
- I'm Jean.

11:54.167 --> 11:55.930
This is
my daughter, Holly.

11:56.002 --> 11:57.333
Hey, how you doing, Holly?

11:57.403 --> 12:00.964
Great, and I think we gotta go
before you learn Step Two.

12:04.710 --> 12:07.702
Lenny, tell me you didn't
use the heaven line.

12:10.483 --> 12:13.543
<i> First days at new schools</i>
<i>always feel the same.</i>

12:13.753 --> 12:17.746
<i>Like suddenly you're on a new planet,</i>
<i>breathing a new atmosphere.</i>

12:19.292 --> 12:21.692
Can you scan this
into Match. com?

12:22.328 --> 12:23.818
Mom, I'm busy.

12:24.096 --> 12:25.461
Doing what?

12:26.032 --> 12:27.897
Do you have to
do this right away?

12:27.967 --> 12:29.525
Can't you just
wait this time...

12:29.602 --> 12:32.127
and see if you meet a guy
the normal way?

12:35.107 --> 12:36.802
Have you seen these lines?

12:36.876 --> 12:38.309
I am in a race against time.

12:38.377 --> 12:40.743
Now get on in there
and scan this thing.

12:40.813 --> 12:43.976
Every second counts.
Tick-tock, tick-tock.

12:45.418 --> 12:48.581
If a student brings a cell phone
to school, it will be confiscated...

12:48.654 --> 12:49.814
regardless of how...

12:49.889 --> 12:52.221
Excuse me.
- I don't even know why we're here.

12:52.291 --> 12:55.089
It's not like they're going to be
my teachers four months from now.

12:55.161 --> 12:56.492
That's negative imaging,
Holly.

12:56.562 --> 12:58.723
...are not permitted
in the school building.

12:58.798 --> 13:02.791
Only winter hats will be permitted
between the months of November...

13:02.869 --> 13:05.895
and February
and kept in your lockers.

13:05.972 --> 13:09.464
Now, I'd like to introduce to you
the Head of our Guidance Department.

13:09.542 --> 13:12.670
Dr. Charles Fitch.
- All right, Fitchy!

13:14.146 --> 13:15.841
Hey, Fitch!

13:17.216 --> 13:19.480
Hey, Dr. Fitch!
- Hey there, everyone.

13:19.552 --> 13:23.955
Let me tell you how I run
the Guidance Department.

13:24.357 --> 13:29.056
I have an open-door policy, which
means you can stop by my office...

13:29.128 --> 13:30.186
whenever you want.

13:30.263 --> 13:33.664
I also have
an open-mind policy.

13:34.100 --> 13:36.330
There are no stupid questions.

13:36.669 --> 13:41.572
So please, if you have something
on your mind, knock on my door.

13:43.910 --> 13:45.036
Mom.

13:45.111 --> 13:47.545
Or raise your hands.

13:48.347 --> 13:51.475
Woman in the back. Go ahead.
- Hi.

13:51.751 --> 13:55.687
Instead of once a year, have you
considered a monthly forum where...

13:55.755 --> 13:59.384
students and teachers could exchange
thoughts in an effort to enhance...

13:59.458 --> 14:01.688
communication and bridge gaps?

14:02.662 --> 14:03.651
That's a...

14:03.729 --> 14:05.856
That's a great comment,
Mrs...

14:05.932 --> 14:07.957
Miss Hamilton.

14:08.768 --> 14:13.034
I also wondered if you'd thought of
monthly mixers for single parents.

14:13.706 --> 14:16.573
Not that I don't want to meet
married parents as well.

14:16.642 --> 14:17.768
I would.

14:17.843 --> 14:20.277
It's just that sometimes
we single parents...

14:20.346 --> 14:22.644
have different concerns
than married ones.

14:22.715 --> 14:25.843
Different priorities.
If you know what I mean.

14:26.152 --> 14:28.245
And by priorities I mean:

14:29.822 --> 14:31.380
I need to meet a good man.

14:35.194 --> 14:37.560
In that case,
where do I sign up?

14:41.100 --> 14:45.434
Okay, well,
this was interesting.

14:45.938 --> 14:47.735
Where were we here?

14:51.444 --> 14:54.572
So you're just not going to talk
to me for the rest of your life?

14:56.015 --> 14:57.414
Come on, Holly.

14:57.483 --> 15:01.010
Every unmarried parent there
appreciated the suggestion.

15:01.287 --> 15:03.653
Did it ever occur to you that
the point of the meeting...

15:03.723 --> 15:05.884
wasn't for the needs
of the single parent?

15:05.958 --> 15:09.121
That the point of the meeting
was maybe for, I don't know...

15:09.195 --> 15:11.493
the kids?
- Well, sure.

15:11.564 --> 15:14.055
I was just thinking...
- About you!

15:14.233 --> 15:16.963
Because you're always
thinking about you.

15:22.975 --> 15:24.636
<i>She's doing it again.</i>

15:24.710 --> 15:27.304
<i>Only this time,</i>
<i>I can't smile and play along.</i>

15:27.813 --> 15:29.906
<i>Because the truth is</i>
<i>I'm tired...</i>

15:29.982 --> 15:33.884
<i>of bubble-wrap and change of address cards,
of figuring out new towns...</i>

15:33.953 --> 15:35.921
<i>and finding new friends.</i>

15:36.188 --> 15:38.213
<i>It's just not fun anymore.</i>

15:38.591 --> 15:40.218
<i>It's just not.</i>

15:56.509 --> 15:58.306
You know what
the entire student body...

15:58.377 --> 16:00.607
is talking about this morning?

16:02.948 --> 16:06.679
The Krispy Kreme truck that
got in a wreck on Eighth Avenue.

16:06.919 --> 16:08.386
There's donuts
everywhere.

16:08.454 --> 16:10.149
It's a total free-for-all.

16:10.222 --> 16:13.919
Between the excitement and the
sugar buzz, everyone's pretty much...

16:13.993 --> 16:17.690
forgotten everything that
happened before 8:00 this morning.

16:24.370 --> 16:25.428
It could have been worse.

16:25.504 --> 16:26.903
Don't worry, it will be.

16:26.972 --> 16:28.496
It always starts the same.

16:28.574 --> 16:31.600
I mean, she starts out hopeful,
and then when the perfect man...

16:31.677 --> 16:34.168
doesn't come around in two
weeks, she gets desperate...

16:34.246 --> 16:35.543
and hooks up with some loser.

16:35.614 --> 16:38.082
Some guy who's not even
good enough to mop her floors.

16:38.150 --> 16:41.142
And then, when it doesn't work
out, because it never works out...

16:41.220 --> 16:44.155
we pack up and move again, and
there's nothing I can do about it.

16:44.223 --> 16:46.453
I can't even run away
because that's what she does.

16:46.525 --> 16:48.755
I thought you said you didn't
mind all the moving around.

16:48.828 --> 16:52.821
I didn't. I mean, I don't.
I just got here.

16:59.405 --> 17:01.236
The River Bistro.

17:01.307 --> 17:02.399
What are we doing here?

17:02.475 --> 17:05.137
I can't even afford to pee
in a place like this.

17:05.211 --> 17:06.644
Much less actually eat here.

17:06.712 --> 17:08.646
Relax,
it's under control.

17:08.714 --> 17:10.511
My uncle's the owner.

17:11.282 --> 17:12.409
Him?

17:14.286 --> 17:16.777
You've got to be kidding.
- No, him.

17:16.856 --> 17:18.881
No, you didn't do that,
did you?

17:20.092 --> 17:22.492
Well, how long
did you keep her waiting?

17:22.862 --> 17:24.853
What? An hour?

17:25.765 --> 17:27.164
Of course she's mad.

17:27.233 --> 17:29.030
What? Hold on.

17:29.702 --> 17:30.999
This is Holly.
- Hi.

17:31.070 --> 17:32.264
Hi, Holly.
- Nice to meet you.

17:32.338 --> 17:34.306
Why wouldn't she be mad?

17:34.940 --> 17:37.875
Well, there's only one thing
you can do: flowers.

17:38.144 --> 17:41.443
And you can't go cheap,
either. Nope.

17:42.248 --> 17:44.773
A dozen, long-stemmed.

17:44.850 --> 17:46.750
He knows about females.

17:46.852 --> 17:50.481
He knows more about females
than I know about females.

17:50.990 --> 17:54.949
In my opinion,
roses always work, always.

17:55.027 --> 17:57.825
He doesn't actually
believe that, does he?

17:58.264 --> 18:00.027
But who am I to know?

18:00.099 --> 18:03.626
Call me tomorrow and let me
know how it worked out. Bye.

18:05.805 --> 18:07.864
Yes, I do believe that.
Don't you?

18:07.940 --> 18:09.908
That flowers always work?
- Yeah.

18:09.975 --> 18:11.499
Not if the guy's a loser.

18:11.577 --> 18:13.511
The flowers aren't going to
change anything.

18:13.579 --> 18:15.604
Flowers are
just flowers, right?

18:16.081 --> 18:17.446
Wow, your friend's
so cynical.

18:17.516 --> 18:19.746
Sounds like
she's not into romance.

18:21.620 --> 18:23.110
You know what?

18:26.192 --> 18:28.387
This is for you.
- Why?

18:29.461 --> 18:32.055
Because a flower like this
is perfect.

18:32.164 --> 18:34.758
And giving a woman a dozen
of them, it's like saying...

18:34.834 --> 18:36.802
there is such a thing
as perfect.

18:36.869 --> 18:37.995
And it's out there.

18:38.070 --> 18:40.265
Don't give up.
You'll find it.

18:40.539 --> 18:41.631
Really?

18:41.707 --> 18:43.766
A yellow rose says
all of that?

18:43.843 --> 18:46.004
Actually a yellow rose
is for your sick grandma.

18:46.078 --> 18:47.841
For a woman, a red rose.

18:47.913 --> 18:51.906
But if you really want to knock her
socks off, you give her an orchid.

18:51.984 --> 18:53.952
Why? What do orchids say?

18:54.453 --> 18:56.250
You ever seen an orchid?

18:56.622 --> 19:00.058
How it floats in the water,
so delicate and beautiful?

19:01.360 --> 19:03.590
When a woman gets an orchid...

19:04.096 --> 19:06.087
well, she feels like...

19:07.166 --> 19:11.159
she's floating on a cloud
of infinite possibility.

19:18.577 --> 19:20.101
I swear I'll pay you back.

19:20.179 --> 19:22.613
I still don't get how flowers
from you will fix things.

19:22.681 --> 19:24.672
Well, they're not flowers,
they're orchids.

19:24.750 --> 19:27.082
And they're not from me.
They're from her perfect man.

19:27.152 --> 19:28.176
Then let him pay.

19:28.254 --> 19:30.188
I would, if he existed.

19:30.289 --> 19:31.449
I'm lost.

19:31.523 --> 19:33.115
Do you remember
what your uncle said?

19:33.192 --> 19:35.524
An orchid will make
my mom feel special.

19:35.594 --> 19:37.926
Which will make her happy.
And not so desperate.

19:37.997 --> 19:40.295
Which would make me happy,
and then everybody wins.

19:42.301 --> 19:43.962
Holly?
- What?

19:44.336 --> 19:46.804
Are you sure this is a good idea?
- I'm sure.

19:46.872 --> 19:48.863
A few flowers
never hurt anyone.

19:51.577 --> 19:53.477
"Annoying mammal."

19:53.545 --> 19:54.944
Six letters.

19:59.752 --> 20:01.652
Hey, Mom.
- Badger.

20:05.824 --> 20:07.485
Boy, am I thirsty.

20:15.434 --> 20:16.526
Was that the buzzer?

20:16.602 --> 20:19.969
Five letters for
"In line to get, maybe."

20:20.272 --> 20:22.502
Mom, wasn't that
the buzzer?

20:22.708 --> 20:25.268
<i>The Times</i> thinks
they're so clever.

20:27.846 --> 20:30.212
I've got to go take
a shower right now.

20:48.901 --> 20:49.890
Hey.

21:13.158 --> 21:14.250
Excuse me.

21:14.326 --> 21:16.419
Hello, that's my flower.

21:16.495 --> 21:18.429
No, it's not, it's mine.

21:18.497 --> 21:21.125
Is your name Jean?
- No, that's my girlfriend.

21:21.200 --> 21:22.599
Okay, what's the card say?

21:22.668 --> 21:24.329
It says,
"To my dearest girlfriend...

21:24.403 --> 21:27.998
"on her birthday, I love you so..."
- Give me my flower back.

21:52.431 --> 21:54.023
Could you be
any more crazy?

21:54.099 --> 21:56.431
I was just
bringing them to you.

22:18.323 --> 22:20.291
Wow! How beautiful.

22:20.993 --> 22:22.517
Who are those for?
- Me.

22:22.594 --> 22:24.687
Isn't that weird,
someone left me flowers?

22:24.763 --> 22:28.199
Who? What's the card say?
- Let's see.

22:31.336 --> 22:35.636
"How many women can look like
a goddess in a bakery uniform?

22:36.075 --> 22:37.804
"You are a vision."

22:38.944 --> 22:40.434
Who sent them?

22:42.014 --> 22:43.914
"A Secret Admirer."

22:45.017 --> 22:46.541
Who could it be?

22:46.618 --> 22:49.052
Well, obviously, someone
that saw you at the shop.

22:49.121 --> 22:51.646
Yeah, but how would
he know my name?

22:52.791 --> 22:54.383
Well, you wear a nametag,
don't you?

22:54.460 --> 22:56.928
Or where I live?
- Duh? Google.

22:57.830 --> 22:59.730
Or that I love orchids?

23:00.532 --> 23:02.659
Maybe he followed you home.

23:04.636 --> 23:06.126
It's very strange.

23:06.205 --> 23:08.173
No, it's probably scary.

23:09.374 --> 23:12.309
Mom, look, this is
the most romantic thing...

23:12.377 --> 23:14.072
that a man has
ever done for you.

23:14.146 --> 23:17.081
Quit questioning it
and enjoy it.

23:20.886 --> 23:22.877
You are absolutely right.

23:31.396 --> 23:34.194
Why are you wearing jeans
under your robe?

23:34.366 --> 23:37.802
How would you like to have
bruises all over your body?

23:45.344 --> 23:47.244
Your uncle is a genius.

23:47.713 --> 23:50.705
It worked?
- She was singing happy songs!

23:50.782 --> 23:52.443
She never sings happy songs.

23:52.518 --> 23:55.351
Yeah, well, neither do I, but
don't send me flowers, okay?

23:55.420 --> 23:57.388
I like it that way.

24:10.135 --> 24:11.124
Hey.

24:20.679 --> 24:24.080
Hey, check it out. Do I got
juice or what? Look at Jean.

24:24.149 --> 24:27.050
A little attention from me and
she's all poofed up like a peacock.

24:27.519 --> 24:29.578
It's the guy peacock
who poofs up.

24:30.222 --> 24:32.315
You know what I'm saying.
It's an animal thing.

24:32.391 --> 24:35.360
She's like a lioness letting
the lion know she's ready.

24:35.427 --> 24:37.987
It's the guy lion
who poofs up, too.

24:41.099 --> 24:43.329
People, don't forget
to read Chapters 42 and 43.

24:43.402 --> 24:44.892
There will be
a test on Friday.

24:44.970 --> 24:47.234
Peter, can I see you
a minute, please?

24:48.340 --> 24:49.500
Hurry up!

24:49.575 --> 24:51.270
What's that?

24:53.011 --> 24:55.309
Nothing.
- Is that supposed to be me?

24:55.914 --> 24:58.439
No, it's somebody else.

24:58.517 --> 24:59.848
The face.

24:59.918 --> 25:01.510
This looks exactly
like my face.

25:01.587 --> 25:03.054
No, it isn't.

25:04.189 --> 25:06.157
Okay, the face
a little bit.

25:06.225 --> 25:08.785
But that woman
is on a horse.

25:09.094 --> 25:10.391
You're not on a horse.

25:10.462 --> 25:12.327
That's a completely
different person.

25:15.167 --> 25:16.657
It's pretty good.

25:16.735 --> 25:20.671
My dad sponsored comic book
conventions when I was a kid.

25:20.739 --> 25:21.933
He'd take me.

25:22.007 --> 25:24.771
If you hang around long
enough, you pick it up.

25:24.843 --> 25:26.834
So you hung out
with your dad a lot?

25:26.912 --> 25:29.745
No. Actually, after he
and my mom split up...

25:29.815 --> 25:32.409
that's pretty much the
only thing we did together.

25:32.651 --> 25:35.552
But, hey, at least I
learned how to draw, right?

25:35.621 --> 25:38.021
Divorce as a career builder.
That's nice.

25:38.090 --> 25:40.991
So, hey,
have you ever been?

25:41.059 --> 25:43.493
Divorced? Not yet.

25:43.962 --> 25:46.260
No, to a comic convention.

25:47.332 --> 25:48.799
No, not that, either.

25:48.867 --> 25:52.234
Well, there's one
coming up.

25:52.304 --> 25:55.364
Six weeks from now.
Westside Convention Center.

25:55.774 --> 25:59.232
It sounds geeky,
but it's kind of fun.

26:01.546 --> 26:05.107
Yeah. I'm not much
of a planner, you know.

26:09.554 --> 26:11.613
Has anyone been
asking for me?

26:11.690 --> 26:13.624
Like who?
- I don't know.

26:13.692 --> 26:14.954
Anyone?
- No.

26:16.028 --> 26:17.017
Hey, Jean.

26:17.362 --> 26:19.887
This has your name
written all over it.

26:21.266 --> 26:23.427
Dolores, you're crazy.

26:23.502 --> 26:26.232
No! She's right. You're
way too good for this place.

26:26.305 --> 26:28.136
This contest is
for professionals.

26:28.206 --> 26:30.538
I mean, I'm basically
a salesperson.

26:30.609 --> 26:32.099
Explain this to me.

26:32.277 --> 26:34.507
How come when it's a man
you're looking at...

26:34.579 --> 26:36.308
you're blind to his flaws...

26:36.381 --> 26:39.214
but when it's you,
flaws is all you see?

26:39.284 --> 26:40.546
Hmm?
- Mmm.

26:50.729 --> 26:52.094
Is it you?

26:52.364 --> 26:53.991
Yeah, it's me, babe.

26:56.802 --> 26:57.791
Hi.

26:59.004 --> 26:59.993
Hi.

27:02.641 --> 27:04.973
I love orchids. Thank you.

27:05.310 --> 27:08.473
This is a rose.
- Which I also love.

27:10.048 --> 27:11.709
So are you free
Saturday night?

27:12.284 --> 27:13.649
What did you have in mind?

27:13.719 --> 27:16.586
Nothing short of
rocking your world, babe.

27:16.655 --> 27:18.748
Well, my world doesn't
rock that easy.

27:18.824 --> 27:21.292
That's right, make him
work for it, girlfriend.

27:21.360 --> 27:23.191
That's on account
of you've never had...

27:23.261 --> 27:26.196
your world rocked by Lenny
"The World-Rocker" Horton.

27:26.865 --> 27:27.854
Okay.

27:28.367 --> 27:30.801
Let's say I check
my social calendar...

27:30.869 --> 27:33.269
and it turns out I am free
Saturday night.

27:33.972 --> 27:34.996
Where are we going?

27:35.073 --> 27:36.938
Only to hear the
greatest American band...

27:37.008 --> 27:38.737
ever to pipe out
a power ballad.

27:39.711 --> 27:40.973
Styx concert.

27:43.315 --> 27:45.010
Something I've never done.

27:45.083 --> 27:46.710
You're a Styx newbie?

27:46.918 --> 27:48.943
These are really hot tickets.

27:49.354 --> 27:51.049
I must really like you.

27:52.224 --> 27:54.658
Okay, so Saturday night.
- Saturday.

27:54.726 --> 27:55.750
Saturday.

27:57.662 --> 27:58.959
What? Stop!

28:00.198 --> 28:03.099
It's impossible that
Lenny is your secret admirer.

28:03.168 --> 28:04.533
Nothing's impossible.

28:04.603 --> 28:06.161
No. Some things are.

28:06.238 --> 28:10.072
Like a man that sends you an
orchid, the most romantic flower...

28:10.142 --> 28:12.610
and then turns around
and sends you a yellow rose.

28:12.677 --> 28:14.076
That's the kind of flower...

28:14.146 --> 28:16.376
that someone sends their sick
grandmother in the hospital.

28:18.049 --> 28:19.573
I'll get it.

28:21.186 --> 28:23.882
Mom, please,
can you just listen to me?

28:23.955 --> 28:25.422
I read that note, okay?

28:25.490 --> 28:26.616
A man like that...

28:26.691 --> 28:29.956
a poet, he doesn't take
a woman to a Styx concert.

28:30.228 --> 28:32.059
Well, it's different.

28:32.831 --> 28:34.662
So is a peanut butter
and glue sandwich.

28:34.733 --> 28:36.291
That doesn't mean
you eat it.

28:36.568 --> 28:40.026
Holly, I like this guy.
He seems to like me.

28:40.105 --> 28:42.164
Would it kill you
to give him a chance?

28:42.974 --> 28:44.669
Princess Zoe?
- Yes.

28:44.743 --> 28:47.871
You can tell I'm a princess
from all my beautiful necklaces.

28:47.946 --> 28:52.349
N-E-C-K-L-A-C-E-S.

28:53.618 --> 28:56.018
Okay. Yeah, that makes sense.

28:58.824 --> 28:59.848
Hi, Lenny.

28:59.925 --> 29:04.225
Wow, Jean. Whoa!
Great outfit.

29:04.296 --> 29:05.991
Damn, where did you get that?

29:06.064 --> 29:07.554
Who's-a-hottie. com?

29:11.670 --> 29:14.138
All right. So, you got
everything you need?

29:14.206 --> 29:16.470
Yeah. Let me just put this on.
- Okay.

29:16.908 --> 29:21.538
Hey, Holly, your mom said that
Saturday night is movie night.

29:22.147 --> 29:23.580
So, what do you say on me...

29:23.648 --> 29:26.310
you take Princess Zoe here,
you guys go see <i>Bambi?</i>

29:28.353 --> 29:31.413
I'm not actually sure that
<i>Bambi</i> is still in theaters.

29:31.490 --> 29:34.152
Which is such a shame because
I'm just dying to take...

29:34.226 --> 29:37.161
my 7-year-old little sister to
a movie where the mom gets...

29:37.229 --> 29:38.821
killed by
the evil male hunter.

29:38.897 --> 29:40.524
I want to go see that.

29:41.666 --> 29:44.294
Thank you, Lenny.
That's very nice of you.

29:45.837 --> 29:48.397
Thank you, Lenny.
That's very nice of you.

29:49.341 --> 29:50.569
Be good.

29:56.047 --> 29:57.810
Wow! It's great.

29:57.883 --> 30:00.852
Yeah, it's a 1980 Pontiac
Trans Am two-door hardtop.

30:00.919 --> 30:03.114
Got the original paint,
the original exhaust.

30:03.188 --> 30:05.315
I re-built the tranny,
tweaked the mill.

30:05.390 --> 30:07.688
And as a matter of fact,
I got...

30:07.759 --> 30:10.660
some new passenger mats right
here, so would you mind...

30:10.729 --> 30:13.425
just taking your shoes off?
Before you get in?

30:14.132 --> 30:16.794
I should have bought a
pair of those hospital booties.

30:16.868 --> 30:18.426
Wait, do you have any?

30:22.374 --> 30:23.466
Let me guess.

30:23.542 --> 30:25.373
The sick-grandma argument
didn't fly?

30:25.443 --> 30:27.001
<i>She barely even heard it.</i>

30:27.078 --> 30:30.445
She was too busy picturing
herself as Mrs. Lenny Hair Band.

30:30.515 --> 30:32.176
He's got to be derailed.

30:32.751 --> 30:35.345
By what?
<i>- I don't know.</i>

30:35.487 --> 30:37.887
Listen, I'm going to drop Zoe
off at Dolores'...

30:37.956 --> 30:39.617
and I'll meet you
at the Bistro in 20.

30:39.691 --> 30:41.215
Ice cream is going to help.

30:41.293 --> 30:42.760
No, but your uncle will.

30:42.827 --> 30:44.852
He knew exactly what to do
about the orchids...

30:44.930 --> 30:46.158
and he'll know
what to do next.

30:46.231 --> 30:47.198
<i>Ciao.</i>

30:48.833 --> 30:50.562
<i># Domo Arigato, Mr. Roboto #</i>

30:50.635 --> 30:53.570
<i># Mata ahoo Hima de #</i>

30:53.638 --> 30:56.971
<i># Domo Arigato, Mr. Roboto #</i>

30:57.042 --> 31:01.775
<i># Himitsu wo Shiri tai #</i>

31:04.549 --> 31:07.074
<i># You're wondering who I am #</i>

31:07.152 --> 31:09.347
<i># Secret, secret,</i>
<i>I've got a secret #</i>

31:09.421 --> 31:10.888
<i># Machine or mannequin #</i>

31:10.956 --> 31:13.618
Lenny, I don't think
that's Styx.

31:13.692 --> 31:16.422
No, they're Kilroy,
they're a tribute band to Styx.

31:16.494 --> 31:18.428
<i># Secret, secret,</i>
<i>I've got a secret ##</i>

31:18.496 --> 31:20.555
Yeah, the singer's not
as good as the original.

31:20.632 --> 31:23.931
But if you close your eyes, you
can't even tell the difference.

31:25.370 --> 31:27.565
Yeah, you can tell.

31:30.842 --> 31:32.104
We have a question.

31:32.944 --> 31:35.037
Mel, put those
two tables together.

31:35.113 --> 31:37.081
Kid, can it wait?
I'm a little busy.

31:37.148 --> 31:40.481
No, it's really important.
- It's for our school assignment.

31:40.552 --> 31:41.678
Due tomorrow.

31:41.753 --> 31:43.778
We need to know what the
perfect man would do...

31:43.855 --> 31:45.152
as a follow-up
to the orchid.

31:45.223 --> 31:46.850
Well, can't we talk
about it tomorrow?

31:46.925 --> 31:49.291
Wait, what could be more
important than the perfect man?

31:49.361 --> 31:50.760
Duh, perfect shoes.

31:50.829 --> 31:52.126
Lance, please.

31:52.197 --> 31:53.562
Don't "Lance, please" me.

31:53.632 --> 31:55.964
Take a break
and help these girls out.

31:56.034 --> 31:57.865
You try the new Shiraz...

31:58.937 --> 32:03.567
sit at your table and let good
old Lance handle the floor.

32:04.876 --> 32:06.537
All right. Five minutes.

32:07.912 --> 32:10.847
Don't play with your hair
at the bar, Lance.

32:16.021 --> 32:20.856
So, what are you writing a school
paper on, dating or something?

32:21.159 --> 32:22.183
Yeah.

32:22.427 --> 32:25.692
Well, what class would that be?
- English.

32:25.764 --> 32:30.531
I'm looking at romantic
heroes, like in literature.

32:31.002 --> 32:33.664
You know...
- Romeo.

32:33.738 --> 32:35.433
Right, or Heathcliff.

32:35.507 --> 32:36.667
Taking guys like that...

32:36.741 --> 32:39.642
and comparing them to their
real-life counterparts.

32:40.578 --> 32:42.773
But you don't believe
in romance.

32:44.082 --> 32:45.709
I'm stretching.

32:47.252 --> 32:50.312
Well, girls, I'm really
not an authority on this.

32:53.391 --> 32:54.380
Hot!

32:56.761 --> 32:59.093
What makes today's
Perfect man perfect?

32:59.164 --> 33:03.225
What is it that he says or does
that makes him a woman's perfect man?

33:04.769 --> 33:06.760
Well, that depends.
Every woman's different.

33:06.838 --> 33:08.738
But yet, orchids work
for all of them?

33:08.807 --> 33:11.571
Well, as a gesture, they do.
I mean, but that's just a...

33:11.943 --> 33:13.638
That's a beginning,
that's...

33:14.446 --> 33:17.040
He's got to have
a deeper connection than that.

33:17.115 --> 33:18.878
He's got to know
what makes her tick.

33:18.950 --> 33:21.510
Which is why, if you don't
know who the woman is...

33:21.586 --> 33:22.848
it's rather a moot point.

33:22.921 --> 33:24.855
She listens to Patsy Cline
when she's sad.

33:24.923 --> 33:26.550
Hypothetically.

33:26.624 --> 33:27.921
Say she does.

33:27.992 --> 33:29.323
Then what?

33:30.628 --> 33:32.562
Patsy Cline's her sad music?

33:34.065 --> 33:35.498
Wait a minute.

33:39.871 --> 33:40.895
Now.

33:43.374 --> 33:46.002
This is very happy music.

33:46.478 --> 33:48.776
Keep it. But you know what?

33:48.847 --> 33:50.838
Even if he does
cheer her up...

33:50.915 --> 33:53.281
he can't be a guy
that's afraid of tears.

33:55.787 --> 33:58.688
<i># Babe, I love you ##</i>

34:04.763 --> 34:06.731
It's like he wrote
it about us.

34:09.601 --> 34:11.228
What if she's into word games?

34:11.302 --> 34:13.031
Scrabble, you know,
stuff like that?

34:13.103 --> 34:15.538
Oh, yeah. Good stuff.

34:15.607 --> 34:18.132
A little wit, a little
wordplay. I like that.

34:18.208 --> 34:20.803
And if she's been
dumped a lot? Then what?

34:20.879 --> 34:21.937
A lot?

34:24.949 --> 34:26.576
That's a tough one.

34:27.018 --> 34:29.485
I guess the perfect guy
would be...

34:30.822 --> 34:33.085
He'd be someone who could...

34:34.425 --> 34:36.949
He could be anywhere
in the world...

34:37.161 --> 34:39.755
but he chooses
to be with her because...

34:40.931 --> 34:43.297
life is better with her
by his side.

34:43.935 --> 34:46.904
What do you think?
Did I pass the test?

34:48.473 --> 34:50.065
Very nice to meet you.

34:50.141 --> 34:51.266
Stop it!

34:51.342 --> 34:52.536
Big problem.

34:54.078 --> 34:55.705
Hey, cutie.
- Hi, Amber.

34:55.780 --> 35:00.410
Hey, okay. Designer dress,
bias cut, wedding chic.

35:01.286 --> 35:02.480
Where's the problem?

35:02.554 --> 35:04.249
It's a small fortune.

35:04.322 --> 35:06.483
No, that's a lie.
It's a large fortune.

35:06.558 --> 35:08.583
It's your day. Do it.

35:09.093 --> 35:10.458
Really?
- Yeah.

35:11.496 --> 35:12.724
I adore you.

35:13.665 --> 35:15.758
Okay, what about the cake?

35:15.834 --> 35:18.394
You know what, girls?
I got to go to work. Really.

35:18.469 --> 35:20.767
I was thinking of something
layers, chocolate, strawberry.

35:20.839 --> 35:22.636
Amber, let's
talk about it tomorrow.

35:22.707 --> 35:25.005
Lance, step away
from the purse.

35:26.077 --> 35:28.170
She's gorgeous.
- Yeah.

35:28.246 --> 35:32.182
Together they look like the winners
of a genetic lottery. Come on.

35:45.496 --> 35:47.657
Here, let me get this
for you. You got it?

35:47.732 --> 35:50.826
Thanks. Well, Lenny, I...
- Whoops, we're wet. Watch it.

35:50.902 --> 35:53.097
I don't even know
what to say. It's been...

35:54.339 --> 35:56.364
Now, Jean,
I had a fantastic time.

35:56.441 --> 35:58.432
I got to tell you,
I really, you know.

35:58.509 --> 36:00.977
I really, I could get
used to this.

36:08.086 --> 36:09.678
You're a good kisser.

36:09.754 --> 36:11.551
It was a really good time.

36:11.623 --> 36:14.558
All right. So,
I'll see you at work, okay?

36:14.993 --> 36:17.086
My shoes.
- I'm sorry.

36:31.843 --> 36:33.606
How was the '80s flashback?

36:34.312 --> 36:35.711
You scared me!

36:35.780 --> 36:38.044
His stupid car is louder
than a jumbo jet.

36:38.116 --> 36:40.641
He probably woke up
the whole entire neighborhood.

36:41.152 --> 36:43.643
Holly, for me, would you
give Lenny a chance?

36:43.721 --> 36:46.952
Mom, for me,
would you go slow this time?

36:47.025 --> 36:48.686
You don't know
who else is out there.

36:48.760 --> 36:50.387
No, but here's what I do know:

36:50.461 --> 36:52.952
Tonight I had
a pretty good time.

36:57.068 --> 36:59.662
"Oh what
a tangled web we weave

36:59.737 --> 37:03.935
"When first
we practice to deceive!"

37:04.008 --> 37:06.602
Who wants to talk
about what that means?

37:07.412 --> 37:09.642
He needs to write her a letter.
- Who?

37:09.714 --> 37:10.738
The perfect man.

37:10.815 --> 37:12.908
Adam, care to elucidate?

37:13.484 --> 37:14.473
Yeah, you.

37:14.552 --> 37:16.782
What do you think Sir Walter
Scott was talking about?

37:16.854 --> 37:20.085
You're going to forge a letter?
- I have to. If I don't...

37:20.158 --> 37:22.149
my mom's going to be
walking down the aisle...

37:22.226 --> 37:23.591
to the sound of <i>Mr. Roboto.</i>

37:23.661 --> 37:26.789
Well, I think, it's that
lies get complicated.

37:27.632 --> 37:28.860
Because?

37:29.267 --> 37:32.168
Usually if you tell a lie,
you have to tell another lie.

37:32.236 --> 37:34.636
Except she's totally going to
recognize my handwriting.

37:34.706 --> 37:37.140
She won't recognize mine.
- True.

37:37.208 --> 37:38.800
And each lie turns into
another lie...

37:38.876 --> 37:41.208
and another lie, and it
makes things complicated.

37:41.279 --> 37:44.806
Until, eventually, you're left
with this big mess of lies...

37:44.882 --> 37:46.440
that you can't
find your way out of.

37:46.517 --> 37:48.542
We'll do it right after school.
- Perfect.

37:48.619 --> 37:50.519
Perfect.
- All right. I'll buy that.

37:50.588 --> 37:53.421
Alana, what does "tangled web"
symbolize?

37:53.725 --> 37:55.784
<i>What if she's into word games?</i>

37:55.860 --> 37:57.521
<i>Scrabble, you know,</i>
<i>stuff like that?</i>

37:57.595 --> 37:59.859
<i>Oh, yeah. Good stuff.</i>

37:59.931 --> 38:02.331
<i>A little wit, a little wordplay.
I like that.</i>

38:02.400 --> 38:04.732
<i> I know what I'm doing</i>
<i>borders on delusional...</i>

38:04.802 --> 38:06.099
<i>but what can I say?</i>

38:06.170 --> 38:08.661
<i>Desperate times call</i>
<i>for desperate measures.</i>

38:08.906 --> 38:10.737
<i>Trust me. If you met Lenny...</i>

38:10.808 --> 38:13.709
<i>you'd lick the envelope</i>
<i>and lend me a stamp.</i>

38:19.751 --> 38:20.843
Hi.

38:22.854 --> 38:24.685
Where did her troops go?

38:24.756 --> 38:27.418
She needed some quiet time...

38:27.492 --> 38:29.016
to think things out.

38:29.460 --> 38:30.950
What kind of things?

38:31.029 --> 38:33.759
Well, you know,
like what her next step is.

38:33.831 --> 38:35.662
You know,
whether she's going to form...

38:35.733 --> 38:40.136
a powerful alliance
with a prince or go it alone.

38:41.105 --> 38:42.538
Which is she gonna choose?

38:42.907 --> 38:44.772
I think she's going to go
with the prince.

38:44.842 --> 38:46.400
Really?
- Oh, yeah.

38:46.811 --> 38:48.972
He's kind of a great guy,
you know.

38:49.047 --> 38:52.574
He's handsome.
He's very nice.

38:52.850 --> 38:54.647
And the thing with the...

38:54.719 --> 38:57.279
Jousting.
- Jousting. Yes.

38:57.355 --> 39:00.586
You should see him joust.
He is like Joe Jouster.

39:00.658 --> 39:02.853
Any time that anybody ever
wants to hang out with him...

39:02.927 --> 39:06.556
he's like "Guys, I can't. I've
gotta practice my jousting."

39:08.766 --> 39:09.960
Do you want to sit?

39:11.836 --> 39:12.894
No.

39:12.970 --> 39:15.666
I made plans
with someone. So...

39:15.740 --> 39:17.833
I thought you weren't
much of a planner.

39:20.344 --> 39:21.641
Yeah. Right.

39:30.588 --> 39:33.648
Holly? Do you think
we're going to stay here?

39:34.158 --> 39:35.420
I don't know. Why?

39:35.493 --> 39:38.394
There's a big spelling bee coming
up with all the other schools.

39:38.463 --> 39:39.725
My teacher entered me.

39:39.797 --> 39:43.198
I bet you're going to win that.
You're the best speller I know.

39:43.267 --> 39:46.862
Yeah. Only, it's not
for a couple of months.

39:48.139 --> 39:51.438
Well, you never
know, we might still be here.

39:51.509 --> 39:54.342
I hope so.
I've never entered anything.

39:54.846 --> 39:56.074
Hi, girls.

39:57.582 --> 39:59.743
Mommy, are you sick?

40:00.585 --> 40:01.813
What?

40:01.886 --> 40:03.547
You don't look normal.

40:03.988 --> 40:06.650
I got a letter.

40:07.024 --> 40:08.457
What kind of letter?

40:08.526 --> 40:10.619
It's a love letter.

40:10.828 --> 40:12.523
What does it say?

40:14.999 --> 40:16.261
One second.

40:17.502 --> 40:19.993
Hey, you! Give me that!

40:21.172 --> 40:22.901
"My dearest Jean.

40:23.608 --> 40:27.942
"The letters J-E-A-N used to spell
out just another word for denim."

40:28.746 --> 40:30.236
This guy is great, Mom.

40:31.048 --> 40:33.983
"But, since I found you, I
hear those four-letter words...

40:34.051 --> 40:36.611
"and all I think about is
another four-letter-word:

40:37.021 --> 40:39.387
"love. L-O-V-E."

40:40.091 --> 40:42.321
Love?
- Yeah.

40:42.860 --> 40:45.988
He loves you?
- That's what he said.

40:47.532 --> 40:49.693
Zoe, he's trying
to be romantic.

40:51.302 --> 40:54.499
"Being near you is like
standing on a triple word score."

40:54.572 --> 40:55.903
He plays Scrabble.

40:56.307 --> 40:58.605
"Everything matters
three times as much.

40:58.676 --> 41:00.507
"The sun shines three times
as bright...

41:00.578 --> 41:02.603
"and I am three times
as happy."

41:03.848 --> 41:05.110
What's this?

41:06.450 --> 41:09.715
He gave you a present?
I like him now.

41:10.955 --> 41:14.152
Smart, witty, romantic.

41:14.425 --> 41:17.019
You can't still think
this guy is Lenny, right?

41:17.094 --> 41:20.393
It is kind of hard to picture
Lenny playing Scrabble.

41:34.011 --> 41:36.104
Come on, Mom, let's dance.

41:43.054 --> 41:44.351
You go, Mom!

41:50.528 --> 41:51.517
Mom.

41:55.600 --> 41:57.033
No!
- Come on.

42:28.232 --> 42:29.722
I can't believe it.

42:31.269 --> 42:33.066
And he sent you
a present, too?

42:33.137 --> 42:36.004
Yeah, a CD of a band I'd
never heard of, but I loved.

42:36.073 --> 42:38.769
It's like he knows me better
than I know myself.

42:38.843 --> 42:40.310
So why is he hiding?

42:40.978 --> 42:43.947
He's not hiding. He's just...
- Just what?

42:45.149 --> 42:47.174
Excuse me? Can you help me?

42:53.190 --> 42:54.680
Dinner's ready.

43:04.035 --> 43:05.832
There must be something wrong
with him.

43:05.903 --> 43:08.235
Who?
- Mr. Wonderful.

43:08.806 --> 43:11.639
What? No, there's nothing
wrong with him. He's perfect.

43:11.709 --> 43:13.404
Then why all the secrecy?

43:13.477 --> 43:16.810
Why doesn't he just come on over,
show his face, and say hello?

43:16.881 --> 43:18.746
Like a normal person.

43:18.816 --> 43:20.181
Listen to yourself.

43:20.251 --> 43:22.583
The man wants to be
the least bit romantic...

43:22.653 --> 43:24.644
and all of sudden you think
he's not normal.

43:24.722 --> 43:27.919
How do I know if he is? And if
he is, what does he look like?

43:27.992 --> 43:29.425
Is he tall, is he short?

43:29.493 --> 43:32.929
Does he have blond, curly hair,
straight, black hair, what?

43:32.997 --> 43:35.465
I bet he has a big,
fat wart on his nose.

43:37.802 --> 43:39.895
I bet that he's really,
really handsome.

43:39.970 --> 43:41.437
And how would you know?

43:41.505 --> 43:43.166
He writes like
he's really handsome.

43:43.240 --> 43:46.869
Honey, have you seen pictures
of Shakespeare? Bald, skinny.

43:47.645 --> 43:49.135
Does that
even really matter?

43:49.213 --> 43:51.408
Yes. Because you can't have
a relationship with a man...

43:51.482 --> 43:53.507
you've never laid eyes on.

43:56.954 --> 43:59.923
Honey, I've got a party of 50
coming in a half an hour.

43:59.990 --> 44:01.480
It will only
take a second.

44:01.559 --> 44:04.027
Oh, You can take my picture.
Just be sure to get my good side.

44:04.095 --> 44:07.724
Over here, Brad Pitt. Over
here, David Spade, not so cute.

44:07.965 --> 44:10.263
No, I'm just swamped,
I'm sorry.

44:11.902 --> 44:15.269
Hey, Uncle Ben, what's that stuff
you put on top of your spinach salad?

44:15.339 --> 44:17.603
Parmesan what?
- Cheese.

44:22.446 --> 44:25.074
Ben. It's a nice name.

44:25.149 --> 44:27.549
Uncomplicated.
Dependable. Ben.

44:27.618 --> 44:30.212
And it's way better than Lenny.
And he's way cuter than Lenny.

44:30.287 --> 44:32.517
Don't you be mean about
Lenny. He's a good egg.

44:32.590 --> 44:34.524
Just not the egg for me.

44:34.592 --> 44:38.084
I like this egg. I want
this egg to be my boyfriend.

44:38.162 --> 44:41.131
When's he coming over?
- As soon as he gets back.

44:41.198 --> 44:42.790
Well, where did he go?

44:42.867 --> 44:45.358
He's opening up a new
restaurant in China.

44:45.436 --> 44:48.337
And the phone lines there
are impossible, evidently.

44:48.406 --> 44:51.102
So as soon as he gets back,
he's going to call.

44:51.175 --> 44:53.735
Cool. What else
does the letter say?

44:54.979 --> 44:57.345
That's private.
Excuse me.

44:59.417 --> 45:00.441
<i>China.</i>

45:00.518 --> 45:03.214
How are we ever going
to get a stamp from China?

45:03.287 --> 45:04.276
We won't.

45:04.355 --> 45:06.380
Now that he's traveling,
he asked her to send...

45:06.457 --> 45:08.220
her e-mail address
to his e-mail address.

45:08.292 --> 45:09.657
He has
an e-mail address?

45:11.595 --> 45:14.063
Brooklyn Boy, this new
account that I'm setting up.

45:14.131 --> 45:17.157
Well, at least it's consistent,
since everyone lies in cyberspace.

45:17.234 --> 45:19.930
But we can't use the computer at
my house in case my mom finds it.

45:20.004 --> 45:22.666
I'd offer ours, except
my brother's on 24/7...

45:22.740 --> 45:25.402
buying those
little Yu-Gi-Oh cards on eBay.

45:25.810 --> 45:27.004
Who else?

45:37.555 --> 45:39.045
It's kind of messy.

45:40.191 --> 45:42.284
It's kind of dark.

45:42.893 --> 45:44.019
Oh, yeah.

45:48.866 --> 45:50.390
Should be on.

45:50.835 --> 45:53.201
Thank you so much
for letting me do this.

45:53.270 --> 45:56.603
You must think that I'm crazy, but
at least my mom's happy, you know.

45:57.541 --> 45:58.769
It's such a change...

45:58.843 --> 46:02.574
'cause she usually spends most of
her time depressed or with idiots.

46:02.646 --> 46:04.011
Maybe I should try it.

46:04.081 --> 46:07.107
My mom only smiles once a month
when the alimony check comes.

46:11.555 --> 46:14.319
<i> And if she's been
dumped a lot? Then what?</i>

46:14.391 --> 46:15.551
<i>A lot?</i>

46:16.227 --> 46:17.785
<i>That's a tough one.</i>

46:18.662 --> 46:20.892
<i>I guess the perfect guy</i>
<i>would be...</i>

46:21.098 --> 46:23.066
<i>He could be anywhere</i>
<i>in the world...</i>

46:23.133 --> 46:25.727
<i>but he chooses</i>
<i>to be with her because...</i>

46:26.036 --> 46:28.630
<i>life is better with her</i>
<i>by his side.</i>

46:38.048 --> 46:39.606
<i>Dear Passionate Baker...</i>

46:39.683 --> 46:42.481
<i>I'm spending my days with very serious</i>
<i>business people...</i>

46:42.553 --> 46:45.522
<i>and I know I should be listening</i>
<i>to every word they say...</i>

46:45.589 --> 46:47.079
<i>but all I keep thinking is...</i>

46:47.157 --> 46:48.988
<i>what am I doing</i>
<i>all the way in China?</i>

46:49.059 --> 46:52.358
Unbelievable. Listen to this.
- Come on. Let's go.

46:52.429 --> 46:53.453
It's from Ben.

46:53.531 --> 46:56.762
"I planned this restaurant
before I'd ever laid eyes on you.

46:56.834 --> 46:58.301
"If I had to do it over...

46:58.369 --> 47:01.566
"I'd buy the building right
next to yours and open there."

47:04.341 --> 47:06.002
He'd rather be with me.

47:09.013 --> 47:10.981
Why don't you write him back?

47:11.482 --> 47:12.471
Good.

47:15.753 --> 47:16.981
Excuse me.

47:20.524 --> 47:21.684
<i>Dear Brooklyn Boy...</i>

47:21.759 --> 47:23.750
<i>if your food's half as good</i>
<i>as your letters...</i>

47:23.827 --> 47:27.126
<i>nothing would make me happier</i>
<i>than having your restaurant on my block.</i>

47:27.197 --> 47:29.290
<i>But I'd hate to deprive</i>
<i>the nation of China...</i>

47:29.366 --> 47:33.666
<i>of that kind of satisfaction.</i>
<i>So open your restaurant there first.</i>

47:34.905 --> 47:36.532
<i>Dear Passionate Baker...</i>

47:36.607 --> 47:38.837
<i>as long as</i>
<i>I'm in the kitchen cooking...</i>

47:38.909 --> 47:41.207
<i>it doesn't matter where I am.</i>

47:43.714 --> 47:46.683
<i> It's a real specific kind</i>
<i>of satisfaction, isn't it...</i>

47:46.750 --> 47:47.944
<i>cooking for people?</i>

47:48.018 --> 47:51.317
<i>I'm only a baker,</i>
<i>but I put as much creativity and passion...</i>

47:51.388 --> 47:54.448
<i>into my cakes</i>
<i>as a painter puts on a canvas.</i>

47:55.225 --> 47:58.422
<i>Granted, when all's said and done,</i>
<i>all I've made is a cake.</i>

47:58.495 --> 48:01.020
<i>But then again, you can't eat</i>
<i>the</i> Mona Lisa.

48:01.498 --> 48:03.830
<i>Waiting, the Passionate Baker.</i>

48:04.168 --> 48:05.795
<i>Dear Passionate Baker...</i>

48:05.869 --> 48:08.030
<i>creativity and passion, huh?</i>

48:08.672 --> 48:11.402
<i>I'm starting to figure out</i>
<i>what makes you tick.</i>

48:13.444 --> 48:15.173
<i>And as for the</i> Mona Lisa...

48:15.245 --> 48:17.110
<i>after a few thousand years...</i>

48:17.181 --> 48:19.172
<i>people are going to get tired</i>
<i>of her smile.</i>

48:19.249 --> 48:21.911
<i>But a good fudge brownie</i>
<i>is eternal.</i>

48:22.386 --> 48:23.648
<i>Dear Brooklyn Boy...</i>

48:23.721 --> 48:26.155
<i>I'm modest about some things,</i>
<i>but not this.</i>

48:26.223 --> 48:29.249
<i>I make the best fudge brownies</i>
<i>on the planet.</i>

48:29.326 --> 48:30.816
<i>Well, it just so happens...</i>

48:30.894 --> 48:32.759
<i>I make the best</i>
<i>homemade ice cream.</i>

48:32.830 --> 48:34.855
<i>Ice cream and brownies.</i>

48:35.299 --> 48:38.598
<i>Now that's a good combo.</i>
<i>That's all I'm looking for.</i>

48:39.370 --> 48:41.031
<i>My own good combo.</i>

48:41.305 --> 48:43.273
<i>Someone I can bring out</i>
<i>the best in...</i>

48:43.340 --> 48:45.865
<i>and someone that brings out</i>
<i>the best in me.</i>

49:48.772 --> 49:50.262
How you doing?

49:50.941 --> 49:52.499
Surprise, surprise.

49:53.077 --> 49:55.978
Lenny, there's something
I need to tell you.

49:56.714 --> 49:58.272
We don't need words.

49:58.348 --> 50:02.011
I know what you're going to say.
And I feel the exact same way.

50:02.419 --> 50:05.252
No, this is important
for me to say.

50:06.757 --> 50:09.123
I met someone...
"And his name is Lenny...

50:09.193 --> 50:11.718
"and he's rocking my world."
I know.

50:11.795 --> 50:14.628
And I know you're scared.
I'm scared, too.

50:14.698 --> 50:18.031
But I also know if the
world turned upside down...

50:18.102 --> 50:21.003
baby, I know you'd always
be around my mind.

50:22.072 --> 50:23.733
The best of times.

50:24.241 --> 50:27.608
These are "the best of times."

50:29.113 --> 50:31.343
I met someone else.

50:31.648 --> 50:32.740
What?

50:32.816 --> 50:35.785
I mean, I didn't meet
someone, but I might.

50:35.853 --> 50:39.687
But the perfect man is standing
right here, next to my cuddles.

50:39.757 --> 50:42.885
Lenny, I'm sorry.
I really am.

50:42.960 --> 50:44.723
You are a great guy.

50:45.763 --> 50:48.061
I'm sorry this wasn't...

50:48.966 --> 50:52.060
"the best of times."

50:57.975 --> 51:01.638
<i># These are
the worst of times <i>##</i></i>

51:09.753 --> 51:10.777
Hey.

51:10.854 --> 51:15.018
I'm in the middle of writing my mom
an e-mail and she just logged on.

51:15.359 --> 51:17.884
IM her.
- Should I?

51:17.961 --> 51:20.987
Yeah, It will make Ben
seem more real, won't it?

51:23.433 --> 51:24.798
Okay.

51:32.509 --> 51:34.636
<i>Fancy running into you here.</i>

51:38.715 --> 51:40.410
<i>What time is it there?</i>

51:46.223 --> 51:47.212
<i>Late.</i>

51:51.795 --> 51:53.092
<i>I thought it would be morning.</i>

51:55.866 --> 51:58.562
<i>It is. Late morning.</i>

51:59.503 --> 52:01.266
<i>What are you doing?</i>

52:05.409 --> 52:07.240
<i>Just thinking.</i>

52:08.979 --> 52:10.344
<i>About what?</i>

52:12.516 --> 52:14.143
<i>You'd be bored.</i>

52:16.386 --> 52:17.648
<i>Try me.</i>

52:17.721 --> 52:20.713
<i>If I stop replying,</i>
<i>you'll know I fell asleep.</i>

52:28.832 --> 52:31.767
<i>Well, I have kids.</i>
<i>Have I mentioned that?</i>

52:34.071 --> 52:36.130
<i>No. That's great.</i>

52:38.408 --> 52:41.309
<i>Two daughters.</i>
<i>Seven and sixteen.</i>

52:43.647 --> 52:46.138
<i>They're lucky to have you</i>
<i>as a mom.</i>

52:52.122 --> 52:55.489
<i>You are the only person</i>
<i>on earth who would say that.</i>

52:55.559 --> 52:58.289
<i>And it's just because</i>
<i>you haven't met me.</i>

52:59.129 --> 53:01.620
<i>I've made</i>
<i>so many mistakes.</i>

53:02.833 --> 53:04.801
<i>Everyone makes mistakes.</i>

53:07.004 --> 53:10.997
<i>Yeah, well,</i>
<i>I make whoppers, over and over...</i>

53:11.074 --> 53:13.338
<i>and my kids are the ones</i>
<i>who suffer.</i>

53:13.410 --> 53:14.934
<i>It's not fair.</i>

53:17.814 --> 53:20.112
<i>This wasn't the plan,</i>
<i>you know.</i>

53:20.851 --> 53:23.684
<i>I had a big future in mind</i>
<i>when I was younger.</i>

53:23.754 --> 53:25.278
<i>I was going to be</i>
<i>a famous baker.</i>

53:25.355 --> 53:27.880
<i>Like Julia Child,</i>
<i>but with desserts.</i>

53:27.958 --> 53:30.017
<i>I was going to go</i>
<i>to a fancy cooking school.</i>

53:30.093 --> 53:31.424
<i>Write cookbooks.</i>

53:31.495 --> 53:34.328
<i>Make people fall in love</i>
<i>with baking again.</i>

53:34.531 --> 53:36.863
<i>I had</i>
<i>all the applications, too.</i>

53:41.838 --> 53:45.604
<i>I was in the middle of filling them out</i>
<i>when I learned I was pregnant.</i>

53:45.676 --> 53:47.803
<i>I thought</i>
<i>it was good news.</i>

53:47.878 --> 53:51.245
<i>A baby fit into</i>
<i>my happily-ever-after plan just fine.</i>

53:51.715 --> 53:54.115
<i>But it didn't fit</i>
<i>into the guy's.</i>

53:54.451 --> 53:57.614
<i>Or maybe it was me</i>
<i>that didn't fit.</i>

53:58.221 --> 54:00.849
<i>Whichever. I was on my own.</i>

54:03.260 --> 54:06.627
<i>So you had your kid instead</i>
<i>of fulfilling your dream.</i>

54:10.300 --> 54:11.790
<i>I guess I did.</i>

54:17.541 --> 54:21.705
<i>If you had to do it all over,</i>
<i>would you have gone to school instead?</i>

54:25.182 --> 54:28.709
<i>Life definitely</i>
<i>would have been easier if I'd done that.</i>

54:29.286 --> 54:31.015
<i>Gotten my act together first.</i>

54:31.088 --> 54:34.683
<i>Had kids later.</i>
<i>But those kids...</i>

54:36.259 --> 54:38.284
<i>wouldn't be Holly</i>
<i>and Zoe.</i>

54:40.230 --> 54:44.564
<i>And life without Holly and Zoe,</i>
<i>I can't even imagine it.</i>

54:46.103 --> 54:48.094
<i>It's just no life at all.</i>

55:32.416 --> 55:33.713
<i>Special message...</i>

55:33.784 --> 55:37.242
<i>to all you bloggers out there</i>
<i>being raised by single moms.</i>

55:37.487 --> 55:39.455
<i>Give the old lady a break.</i>

55:39.523 --> 55:41.753
<i>She's doing the best she can.</i>

55:52.602 --> 55:53.660
Yeah.

55:53.737 --> 55:55.102
Okay, one cherry cake.

55:55.172 --> 55:57.163
Yeah,
that would be great.

55:57.240 --> 55:59.936
$12.99. Thanks.

56:00.010 --> 56:01.705
Thank you. Bye.

56:08.085 --> 56:09.848
Can I help you?

56:11.855 --> 56:13.652
<i>Attention, shoppers.</i>

56:14.024 --> 56:15.616
<i>Need a little pick-me-up?</i>

56:15.692 --> 56:17.956
<i>Why don't you head on over</i>
<i>to our coffee corner...</i>

56:18.028 --> 56:22.692
<i>and pick yourself up a
<i>half-caf caramel macchiato?</i></i>

56:23.567 --> 56:26.331
<i>But remember,</i>
<i>coffee can be hot.</i>

56:28.605 --> 56:32.063
<i>It can have an intensity</i>
<i>like you've never felt before.</i>

56:32.209 --> 56:34.404
<i>Searing deep into your flesh.</i>

56:34.478 --> 56:35.672
Is he joking?

56:35.745 --> 56:38.543
<i>Your tender, vulnerable...</i>

56:39.950 --> 56:41.781
<i>so-easily-hurt flesh.</i>

56:43.920 --> 56:48.254
<i>So be sure to ask for a protective sleeve</i>
<i>when you pick up your coffee.</i>

56:48.358 --> 56:51.555
<i>Maybe ask for another one</i>
<i>to slip over your heart.</i>

56:54.698 --> 56:56.029
<i>Thank you.</i>

57:03.073 --> 57:05.541
And I bought these butterfly
clips so that you can use it...

57:05.609 --> 57:07.577
and clip the braids back.
But don't pull.

57:07.644 --> 57:09.043
Okay.
- It hurts.

57:09.146 --> 57:12.741
Okay, I'm taking Zoe to her play date,
then I'm going to Gloria's shower.

57:12.816 --> 57:14.215
Don't burn the place down.

57:14.284 --> 57:15.683
Wow. Look at you.

57:16.052 --> 57:17.451
Where they having it,
at the Ritz?

57:17.521 --> 57:18.681
Close to it.

57:18.755 --> 57:21.246
Some whoop-de-do spot
named the River Bistro.

57:21.324 --> 57:22.689
No!
- Ow!

57:24.294 --> 57:26.489
Isn't that way over
everybody's budget?

57:26.563 --> 57:29.828
Yeah, but Gloria's cousin's wife
works with their dairy guy...

57:29.900 --> 57:31.731
and he got her a deal
on the party room.

57:31.801 --> 57:33.735
I heard the food's
really bad there.

57:33.803 --> 57:37.500
Everyone who eats there gets
really sick. Vomiting for days.

57:38.909 --> 57:41.935
I'll take my chances.
Let's go, sweetie.

57:44.614 --> 57:46.445
Where is he?
- I don't know.

57:46.516 --> 57:48.541
Maybe the restaurant.
Maybe home.

57:48.618 --> 57:51.143
Okay, you go to the restaurant.
I'm going to go to his place.

57:51.221 --> 57:54.213
If I see him, I'll stall
him. Now, what's his address?

57:55.825 --> 57:58.191
"To begin again in Egypt."

58:01.565 --> 58:02.930
Seven letters.

58:02.999 --> 58:05.627
Oh, <i>The Times</i> thinks
they're so clever.

58:12.943 --> 58:15.138
<i> Hello?</i>
- Hey, thank God you're here.

58:16.713 --> 58:19.910
Who is this?
- It's Holly.

58:20.483 --> 58:22.917
<i>Who?</i>
- Amy's friend, Holly.

58:23.853 --> 58:27.050
Oh, Holly. Yeah, well,
Amy's not here.

58:27.123 --> 58:29.523
<i>I know. I came</i>
<i>to see you, actually.</i>

58:29.593 --> 58:31.561
<i>It's something</i>
<i>really important.</i>

58:31.628 --> 58:35.257
Okay. I'll buzz you in.

58:35.332 --> 58:37.266
The door's open up here.

58:40.503 --> 58:44.166
Hi.
- Hey, straight ahead.

58:49.546 --> 58:51.537
Hey.
- Hi.

58:53.516 --> 58:54.676
Wow!

58:55.452 --> 58:57.079
This is the most
amazing kitchen...

58:57.153 --> 58:59.053
I've ever seen
in my whole entire life.

58:59.122 --> 59:00.851
Really?
- Yeah.

59:00.924 --> 59:02.118
Thanks.

59:03.026 --> 59:05.995
I know someone that would
just kill for this kitchen.

59:07.631 --> 59:10.259
I bet Amber likes it a lot, huh?
- Amber?

59:10.367 --> 59:13.302
Well, she's got her finger
on everything I do...

59:13.370 --> 59:15.770
but not this kitchen.

59:19.676 --> 59:21.667
How about you have a seat
and I'll get you a soda?

59:21.745 --> 59:23.508
Is that okay?
- Okay.

59:37.294 --> 59:39.728
You do <i>The Times</i>
crossword in pen?

59:39.863 --> 59:41.888
Yeah. Is that
a bad thing?

59:44.367 --> 59:46.426
How do you feel
about the moon?

59:46.503 --> 59:47.492
Excuse me?

59:47.570 --> 59:49.697
Do you think that it's
a little piece of magic...

59:49.773 --> 59:52.139
that comes out every night,
even when times get hard...

59:52.208 --> 59:55.336
to remind you that every day
holds potential for beauty?

59:56.846 --> 01:00:00.213
What has Amy told you about me?
- Nothing.

01:00:00.283 --> 01:00:02.376
She just said
that you were really smart.

01:00:02.452 --> 01:00:04.443
And I'm new to town.

01:00:04.521 --> 01:00:06.182
It's a new school.

01:00:06.456 --> 01:00:09.425
I don't really have a dad
to turn to for advice, either.

01:00:09.492 --> 01:00:11.722
So thought I'd ask you.

01:00:16.333 --> 01:00:18.096
Well, all right.
I guess I can try to help.

01:00:18.168 --> 01:00:20.693
I'm not really a,
you know...

01:00:21.705 --> 01:00:23.673
What did you
want to know?

01:00:23.740 --> 01:00:24.832
It's nothing.

01:00:24.908 --> 01:00:28.469
It's just, I'm going through
my teenage years.

01:00:28.545 --> 01:00:29.842
And that's confusing.

01:00:29.913 --> 01:00:33.314
I'm confused about who I am
and what my purpose is in life.

01:00:33.383 --> 01:00:34.941
What college I should go to.

01:00:35.018 --> 01:00:36.542
If I should even go
to college.

01:00:36.619 --> 01:00:39.315
I'm trying to resist peer pressure
to do all sorts of things...

01:00:39.389 --> 01:00:42.881
that I know that I shouldn't do, but
some of them I kind of want to do.

01:00:42.959 --> 01:00:44.051
If you know what I mean.

01:00:44.127 --> 01:00:46.652
I'm considering getting my nose
pierced and my belly button...

01:00:46.730 --> 01:00:48.027
and nine other parts
of my body.

01:00:48.098 --> 01:00:50.328
But my mom said she would
totally kill me if I did that...

01:00:50.400 --> 01:00:52.664
so now I'm just thinking about
getting a tattoo on my back.

01:00:52.736 --> 01:00:54.636
But it wouldn't be
really considered my back...

01:00:54.704 --> 01:00:57.036
because it would be so low that
you wouldn't be able to see it.

01:00:57.107 --> 01:01:00.975
Unless I wore my jeans low
enough. I'm really confused.

01:01:10.954 --> 01:01:12.046
Where?

01:01:15.625 --> 01:01:17.115
Yeah?
- Ben.

01:01:17.193 --> 01:01:19.024
<i>Yeah?</i>
- We got big problems down here.

01:01:19.095 --> 01:01:21.063
Huge, massive.
- What?

01:01:21.131 --> 01:01:24.191
The pilot light on that big thing
that cooks the food? It's out again.

01:01:24.634 --> 01:01:28.297
No, it can't be broken. I
just bought it two months ago.

01:01:28.471 --> 01:01:33.101
Ben, I am telling you, the only gas
I'm smelling is coming from Pablo.

01:01:33.576 --> 01:01:34.702
Okay.

01:01:35.111 --> 01:01:38.205
Calm down.
I'm coming right now. Goodbye.

01:01:39.215 --> 01:01:42.946
Holly, I got a problem at the
restaurant, so I have to go.

01:01:43.019 --> 01:01:46.011
No, you can't!
- Why not?

01:01:47.123 --> 01:01:51.287
I mean, can I come?
- Yeah, why not? Come on.

01:01:53.863 --> 01:01:56.354
I've got to go to the bathroom
really bad.

01:01:56.433 --> 01:01:57.593
Yeah, well, go.

01:01:57.667 --> 01:01:59.532
There's the bathroom there,
but hurry up.

01:01:59.602 --> 01:02:01.001
Right there
through that door.

01:02:01.504 --> 01:02:02.971
I love this.

01:02:05.208 --> 01:02:07.005
You have got to be
kidding me.

01:02:07.076 --> 01:02:09.306
This isn't
going to cover anything.

01:02:09.379 --> 01:02:10.778
That's exactly
the point.

01:02:14.784 --> 01:02:16.376
Houston, we have a problem.

01:02:16.820 --> 01:02:19.186
What kind?
- The very, very bad kind.

01:02:19.255 --> 01:02:20.847
He's on his way
to the restaurant now.

01:02:21.491 --> 01:02:23.550
Oh, my God!
What do we do?

01:02:23.626 --> 01:02:26.288
Create a distraction.
A really, really big one.

01:02:26.729 --> 01:02:28.788
<i>I'll see you there. Bye.</i>

01:02:38.274 --> 01:02:40.936
Do we have to take a cab?
I hate cabs.

01:02:41.010 --> 01:02:43.069
Maybe we should walk.
- What are you, crazy?

01:02:43.146 --> 01:02:46.309
We're going to the River Bistro.
- I get carsick.

01:02:56.092 --> 01:02:57.389
Boys!

01:03:04.033 --> 01:03:06.627
Come on,
get your free beer.

01:03:07.370 --> 01:03:08.837
Free beer!

01:03:16.079 --> 01:03:18.206
Bring on the beer.

01:03:18.715 --> 01:03:20.580
Yeah, bring on the Beer.

01:03:22.218 --> 01:03:25.278
Look, it's time for
your break. Bye-bye.

01:03:25.788 --> 01:03:29.451
Hi! How are you?
- Good.

01:03:29.526 --> 01:03:31.494
Some sort of Village People
convention in town?

01:03:31.561 --> 01:03:33.722
We saw the sign outside
and we want the free beer.

01:03:33.796 --> 01:03:38.495
Free beer? Why would I give
you... I'd give you free beer.

01:03:38.568 --> 01:03:39.933
You look absolutely parched.

01:03:43.773 --> 01:03:45.536
Thanks a lot, my friend.

01:03:52.615 --> 01:03:54.515
I think I'm going to need
another mimosa...

01:03:54.584 --> 01:03:55.949
to open the rest
of these gifts.

01:03:56.019 --> 01:03:57.782
I'll get the waiter.

01:04:00.823 --> 01:04:01.881
Lance!

01:04:01.958 --> 01:04:04.085
Hi, Mom.
- What are you doing here?

01:04:04.627 --> 01:04:05.889
I just, I miss you.

01:04:05.962 --> 01:04:07.623
Free...
- Lance!

01:04:07.697 --> 01:04:10.063
What is this?
- What, nothing.

01:04:10.133 --> 01:04:11.964
Is this your idea?
- No.

01:04:12.035 --> 01:04:13.332
No, I would never do...

01:04:13.403 --> 01:04:16.338
Well, actually I would do
that, but I didn't do it.

01:04:16.406 --> 01:04:18.874
Why didn't I?
- The sign says free beer.

01:04:18.942 --> 01:04:20.432
We want our free beer. Yeah.

01:04:20.510 --> 01:04:23.377
J-E-T-S! Jets!

01:04:24.180 --> 01:04:25.545
What's that?

01:04:26.215 --> 01:04:27.876
Look! What a neat gift!

01:04:30.086 --> 01:04:31.451
I feel like a queen.

01:04:32.789 --> 01:04:37.419
Fellows, we're not a sports bar,
but one free beer on the house...

01:04:37.493 --> 01:04:40.690
but that's it.
- Free beer!

01:04:43.032 --> 01:04:44.590
You're a Jets fan, right?

01:04:44.667 --> 01:04:47.830
Oh my God, hello!
I live for <i>West Side Story.</i>

01:04:47.904 --> 01:04:50.498
Pablo, what happened?
- I don't know.

01:04:51.074 --> 01:04:52.974
Now, these are
brand new stoves.

01:04:53.042 --> 01:04:54.805
What about the pizza oven?
- Try it.

01:04:54.877 --> 01:04:56.401
Okay, I am getting the waiter.

01:04:56.479 --> 01:04:57.969
Does anyone want anything
besides mimosas?

01:04:58.047 --> 01:05:00.072
That's working. It's got
to be the gas line, right?

01:05:00.149 --> 01:05:02.242
Champagne.
- White wine.

01:05:02.318 --> 01:05:04.513
What happened?
It's not lighting?

01:05:04.587 --> 01:05:06.714
What are you doing?
- Sorry.

01:05:06.789 --> 01:05:09.223
Mom! I'm going to
get the waiter.

01:05:09.292 --> 01:05:11.419
Why don't you sit here
and enjoy your lunch?

01:05:11.494 --> 01:05:13.894
Pablo, keep working on it.
I got to call.

01:05:13.963 --> 01:05:15.590
Waiter! Excuse me.

01:05:15.665 --> 01:05:17.223
I'm calling
from the River Bistro.

01:05:17.300 --> 01:05:19.097
We have a problem here.
I need someone right away.

01:05:19.168 --> 01:05:21.602
This isn't working.
- I know, what do we do?

01:05:21.671 --> 01:05:22.865
Think.

01:05:25.074 --> 01:05:26.371
Go stall.

01:05:33.383 --> 01:05:34.577
Put this on here.

01:05:34.651 --> 01:05:37.032
It's so much more fun if
you accessorize with color.

01:05:37.033 --> 01:05:37.347
Lance.

01:05:39.288 --> 01:05:41.552
Please, please forgive me.

01:05:54.537 --> 01:05:57.438
I don't know.
I got to make sure that...

01:05:57.974 --> 01:06:00.807
Front door, everyone.

01:06:01.277 --> 01:06:03.768
Floor's wet.
Be careful, don't run.

01:06:04.313 --> 01:06:07.510
Don't panic.
Front door. Don't panic.

01:06:09.218 --> 01:06:11.243
Everybody out the front door.

01:06:12.055 --> 01:06:14.751
Where's Holly? Holly?

01:06:35.778 --> 01:06:38.542
We may be in big
trouble, but that rocked!

01:06:38.614 --> 01:06:40.775
I swear the CIA
should hire us.

01:06:40.850 --> 01:06:42.784
Nobody saw anybody.

01:06:43.486 --> 01:06:45.977
I mean, are we great,
or what?

01:06:47.657 --> 01:06:50.285
Your uncle does
crossword puzzles in pen.

01:06:50.727 --> 01:06:51.819
What?

01:06:52.662 --> 01:06:56.393
And his kitchen is,
it's perfect.

01:06:56.699 --> 01:06:57.893
So?

01:06:58.067 --> 01:07:00.535
You know even though
he didn't say it out loud...

01:07:00.603 --> 01:07:03.629
I know that he knows that
the moon isn't just a rock.

01:07:06.542 --> 01:07:07.975
What are you
talking about?

01:07:08.044 --> 01:07:10.569
There is such a thing
as the perfect man.

01:07:11.147 --> 01:07:13.411
And I know exactly
who it is for my mom.

01:07:13.483 --> 01:07:15.474
Who?
- Your Uncle Ben.

01:07:15.551 --> 01:07:16.677
What?

01:07:16.753 --> 01:07:20.314
And now because of my stupid
scheme, they can never meet.

01:07:22.391 --> 01:07:24.120
I'm so beyond lost.

01:07:24.794 --> 01:07:25.920
You were right.

01:07:25.995 --> 01:07:28.088
I should have never bought
that orchid.

01:07:28.164 --> 01:07:30.530
The whole thing was
just a huge mistake.

01:07:37.740 --> 01:07:38.764
Hey.

01:07:38.841 --> 01:07:41.366
I need to ask you
a huge favor.

01:07:41.444 --> 01:07:42.604
Hi to you, too.

01:07:42.678 --> 01:07:44.908
I need you to break up
with my mom for me.

01:07:44.981 --> 01:07:46.949
When did I start
dating her?

01:07:47.016 --> 01:07:49.348
Not as you.
As the perfect man, Ben.

01:07:50.586 --> 01:07:51.917
No way.

01:07:52.688 --> 01:07:54.246
Come on. Please.

01:07:55.124 --> 01:07:58.890
Just call her at 7:00, put on a
deep voice and tell her it's over.

01:07:58.961 --> 01:08:00.360
What's my reason?

01:08:00.429 --> 01:08:03.227
Men never have reasons.
They just split.

01:08:04.066 --> 01:08:06.660
Why can't you just
break up over e-mail?

01:08:06.736 --> 01:08:08.533
Because that's too cold.

01:08:08.604 --> 01:08:10.595
Besides, I want her
to hear his voice.

01:08:10.673 --> 01:08:12.163
Yeah, but it wouldn't be
his voice.

01:08:12.241 --> 01:08:15.142
It would be mine, what with
him not existing and all.

01:08:15.211 --> 01:08:18.203
Come on, you know what I mean.
Please, Adam.

01:08:18.281 --> 01:08:20.647
If I tell her that this was
all fake, she'll be crushed.

01:08:20.716 --> 01:08:22.115
And she'll never
forgive me.

01:08:22.185 --> 01:08:25.120
But if he just dumps her,
that she's used to.

01:08:37.767 --> 01:08:38.825
Hello?

01:08:38.901 --> 01:08:42.131
<i> There's no way I'm doing this.</i>
- May I ask who's calling?

01:08:42.205 --> 01:08:44.469
<i>Holly, can we just talk about it?</i>
- Sure.

01:08:44.540 --> 01:08:47.839
Mom, it's for you.
<i>- No, no, it's not funny.</i>

01:08:47.910 --> 01:08:50.344
Hello.
- Hi!

01:08:52.448 --> 01:08:55.417
This is Ben calling.

01:08:55.484 --> 01:08:59.853
Ben?
As in "Ben" Ben?

01:09:01.924 --> 01:09:03.858
I don't know.

01:09:03.926 --> 01:09:07.987
How many Bens do you know?
- None.

01:09:08.064 --> 01:09:10.032
I mean, one.
I know you.

01:09:12.535 --> 01:09:13.763
Wow.

01:09:14.670 --> 01:09:16.796
How is China?

01:09:17.673 --> 01:09:18.662
China.

01:09:19.075 --> 01:09:22.738
It's very Chinese.

01:09:25.448 --> 01:09:27.848
Lots of Chinese people.

01:09:28.184 --> 01:09:29.446
<i>Chinese food.</i>

01:09:30.620 --> 01:09:32.087
You're funny.

01:09:32.255 --> 01:09:33.950
And you're calling me...

01:09:34.790 --> 01:09:36.781
from halfway
around the world.

01:09:37.493 --> 01:09:40.859
Yes, because there's something
that I wanted to tell...

01:09:41.964 --> 01:09:44.296
It's really good
to finally hear your voice.

01:09:44.966 --> 01:09:48.493
Wait. Are you crying?

01:09:48.837 --> 01:09:50.032
No.

01:09:51.540 --> 01:09:53.029
God, yes.

01:09:53.643 --> 01:09:57.135
Yes, I am, but only
because I'm happy.

01:09:58.881 --> 01:10:00.314
You make me happy.

01:10:02.051 --> 01:10:03.712
<i>Know what I mean?</i>

01:10:04.921 --> 01:10:06.286
I guess.

01:10:07.823 --> 01:10:10.314
Yeah, I do.

01:10:11.661 --> 01:10:13.788
God, my whole life...

01:10:14.397 --> 01:10:17.594
I mean, everything's been
so messed up...

01:10:19.135 --> 01:10:23.196
and I just started getting to know
you, and I don't know, I just...

01:10:24.407 --> 01:10:26.068
I started feeling just...

01:10:27.710 --> 01:10:29.644
Clearer.
<i>- Yes!</i>

01:10:30.246 --> 01:10:33.773
<i>Yes. You know what I mean.</i>
- Yeah, I do.

01:10:34.183 --> 01:10:37.914
It's like all of the bad
stuff that you went through...

01:10:38.354 --> 01:10:40.584
that you hated
along the way...

01:10:40.656 --> 01:10:42.283
<i>the people</i>
<i>who disappointed you...</i>

01:10:42.358 --> 01:10:45.122
the things that didn't go
the way you wanted.

01:10:45.194 --> 01:10:49.426
Suddenly you feel grateful to
them because they're the things...

01:10:49.498 --> 01:10:52.262
that got you to here.
To this.

01:10:52.835 --> 01:10:55.463
Yes. Exactly.

01:10:55.538 --> 01:10:59.099
<i> I guess that's just what's</i>
<i>it like when you, you know...</i>

01:10:59.175 --> 01:11:00.267
No.

01:11:00.343 --> 01:11:01.469
What?

01:11:02.144 --> 01:11:06.103
Really like someone.

01:11:09.518 --> 01:11:11.076
So, you like me?

01:11:13.255 --> 01:11:14.847
Yeah. Yeah.

01:11:14.991 --> 01:11:18.552
I do. I mean I might even...

01:11:23.899 --> 01:11:26.732
You might even what?

01:11:30.272 --> 01:11:33.332
Give me a ride, horsey!
- No. Not now, Zoe.

01:11:34.443 --> 01:11:35.876
I might even...

01:11:37.046 --> 01:11:38.206
Holly!

01:11:38.714 --> 01:11:39.681
love you.

01:11:40.483 --> 01:11:41.575
Hello?

01:11:42.518 --> 01:11:43.485
Hello?

01:11:51.327 --> 01:11:52.316
Hey!

01:11:53.095 --> 01:11:54.722
What were you thinking?

01:11:54.797 --> 01:11:57.197
That isn't even close
to what I asked you to do.

01:11:57.266 --> 01:11:59.359
I got distracted.

01:11:59.435 --> 01:12:01.562
By what? A lobotomy?

01:12:01.637 --> 01:12:04.504
Because short of that, short of
you telling me that somebody came...

01:12:04.573 --> 01:12:07.736
and actually removed your brain,
I can't even begin to...

01:12:11.180 --> 01:12:12.442
By you.

01:12:12.882 --> 01:12:15.476
I was distracted by you.

01:12:34.503 --> 01:12:36.130
Hey, Mom?
- Yeah?

01:12:37.840 --> 01:12:40.274
Do you remember
when we first got here...

01:12:41.644 --> 01:12:43.612
and you were feeling
so lousy?

01:12:43.979 --> 01:12:45.708
What about it?

01:12:46.215 --> 01:12:48.513
Well, the thing is...

01:12:48.584 --> 01:12:51.553
I just hated seeing you
like that. And...

01:12:51.620 --> 01:12:56.489
<i># Lady, when you're with me I'm smiling <i>#</i></i>

01:12:58.327 --> 01:13:03.230

<i># Touch me

01:13:17.346 --> 01:13:18.438
Will you shut up?

01:13:18.514 --> 01:13:19.606
No way.

01:13:19.682 --> 01:13:24.619
<i># Lady, from the moment
I saw you <i>#</i></i>

01:13:25.321 --> 01:13:26.549
I'm sorry.

<i># Standing all alone #</i>

01:13:32.328 --> 01:13:33.693

<i># Lady ##</i>

01:14:16.872 --> 01:14:20.603
Encore! Sweet! Very good.

Hey, take it easy.

01:14:24.847 --> 01:14:25.836
Marry me?

01:14:25.915 --> 01:14:26.711
Marry him!

01:14:38.527 --> 01:14:40.324
Oh, God, please tell me
that you didn't say yes.

01:14:40.396 --> 01:14:43.593
Please tell me that you said no.
- I said I'd think about it.

01:14:43.666 --> 01:14:46.226
What? What is there
to think about?

01:14:48.103 --> 01:14:50.094
Is there even a jewel
in there?

01:14:51.473 --> 01:14:54.340
Lenny is not your soul mate.
Ben is.

01:14:54.677 --> 01:14:57.077
Ben is in China. Maybe.

01:14:57.146 --> 01:14:59.011
I mean, who really knows?

01:14:59.181 --> 01:15:02.173
The only thing I know for sure
about Ben is he is a beautiful idea.

01:15:02.251 --> 01:15:05.186
But you can't grow old
with a beautiful idea.

01:15:06.855 --> 01:15:08.584
Why are you so desperate?

01:15:09.225 --> 01:15:12.854
Oh, Holly, it is so easy
for you to judge.

01:15:13.729 --> 01:15:16.027
You haven't had to go
through life alone with kids.

01:15:16.098 --> 01:15:17.827
Nobody to turn to for help.

01:15:17.900 --> 01:15:20.061
I'm not complaining.
I made my bed.

01:15:20.336 --> 01:15:24.238
But I have been slugging it out
alone for a heck of a long time.

01:15:25.241 --> 01:15:28.142
You two girls are the best
thing that's ever happened to me.

01:15:28.210 --> 01:15:31.008
In the blink of an eye,
you'll be grown and gone.

01:15:31.347 --> 01:15:35.283
And Lenny's a sweet guy. Maybe
he'll be different than the others.

01:15:36.919 --> 01:15:38.978
I don't want to wind up alone.

01:16:01.310 --> 01:16:03.540
Do not unlock that door
till I get back.

01:16:24.166 --> 01:16:25.360
Hello.

01:16:27.202 --> 01:16:30.228
Hi, I'm
calling for Miss Jean Hamilton.

01:16:30.739 --> 01:16:32.229
Yes, this is Jean.

01:16:32.308 --> 01:16:34.776
<i> This is Ben's secretary. Ben's</i>
<i>coming back into New York...</i>

01:16:34.843 --> 01:16:36.708
<i>and he would like</i>
<i>to see you.</i>

01:16:37.279 --> 01:16:39.509
Really?
<i>- How's tomorrow afternoon...</i>

01:16:39.581 --> 01:16:41.606
<i>under the Brooklyn Bridge</i>
<i>sound?</i>

01:16:44.386 --> 01:16:46.718
Excellent. 4:00.
He'll see you then.

01:17:25.794 --> 01:17:28.957
Where's Ben? I need to talk
to him. It's an emergency.

01:17:29.031 --> 01:17:30.828
Oh, Too late, little lady.
He's already gone.

01:17:30.899 --> 01:17:33.527
Where?
- The almighty wedding.

01:17:33.602 --> 01:17:35.297
Wedding? What wedding?

01:17:35.704 --> 01:17:37.604
Well, Amber and...
- Amber?

01:17:37.673 --> 01:17:38.662
Amber?

01:17:38.741 --> 01:17:40.766
I know. He didn't
really want to do it...

01:17:40.843 --> 01:17:42.071
but she's hard to say no to.

01:17:42.144 --> 01:17:43.372
Where is it?

01:17:43.579 --> 01:17:45.547
Liberty Grand Hotel.
- Thanks.

01:17:46.281 --> 01:17:48.306
So not a party without me.

01:17:49.618 --> 01:17:50.846
Whatever.

01:18:08.871 --> 01:18:10.031
Sorry, guys.

01:18:11.273 --> 01:18:14.003
We are gathered here
in the sight of God...

01:18:14.576 --> 01:18:16.703
and in the face
of this company...

01:18:16.812 --> 01:18:20.043
to join together this man
and this woman...

01:18:24.253 --> 01:18:25.686
If anyone present...

01:18:25.754 --> 01:18:29.918
knows a reason why these two
should not be lawfully wedded...

01:18:30.893 --> 01:18:34.454
speak now
or forever hold your peace.

01:18:34.663 --> 01:18:35.925
He can't marry her!

01:18:45.641 --> 01:18:48.132
What are you doing?
You can't come in here.

01:18:49.077 --> 01:18:50.772
He's got to marry my mom.

01:18:51.947 --> 01:18:54.643
You might not even know it yet,
but you will once you read these.

01:18:54.716 --> 01:18:55.648
Holly.

01:18:55.717 --> 01:18:58.845
It's pages and pages of proof
that you guys are soul mates...

01:18:58.921 --> 01:19:02.015
and right now she's waiting to
meet you under the Brooklyn Bridge.

01:19:02.090 --> 01:19:05.890
And when you do, you'll know that
you guys are perfect for each other.

01:19:06.995 --> 01:19:09.463
You guys both
do the crosswords in pen...

01:19:09.531 --> 01:19:12.557
and know what a kitchen should feel
like and what the moon really is.

01:19:12.634 --> 01:19:16.900
And without even meeting her,
you picked out her favorite song.

01:19:18.607 --> 01:19:21.667
And it's made her happier
than she's ever been. And...

01:19:43.732 --> 01:19:45.427
You know what,
you guys?

01:19:45.601 --> 01:19:48.126
I'm looking for
the Silverman wedding.

01:19:48.470 --> 01:19:51.496
Sorry. Carry on.
My bad.

01:19:52.841 --> 01:19:54.331
David, I'm so sorry.

01:19:54.409 --> 01:19:55.933
Son, are you all right?

01:19:56.011 --> 01:19:57.376
Holly!

01:20:00.616 --> 01:20:02.982
I'm sorry.
I made a mistake, okay?

01:20:03.619 --> 01:20:05.849
Well, that's just the
understatement of the year.

01:20:05.921 --> 01:20:07.218
What are you thinking?

01:20:07.289 --> 01:20:09.154
I thought you were
the one marrying Amber.

01:20:09.224 --> 01:20:11.089
Me?
- Lance said...

01:20:11.159 --> 01:20:12.626
No! Amber's one
of my dearest friends.

01:20:12.694 --> 01:20:14.685
I'm catering her wedding.

01:20:15.230 --> 01:20:16.857
What's left of it.

01:20:18.467 --> 01:20:20.594
What are you doing?
- Read these.

01:20:20.669 --> 01:20:22.660
No, that's not an answer.
- Yes, it is.

01:20:22.738 --> 01:20:25.707
If you'd just read
these e-mails, you'll see.

01:20:26.308 --> 01:20:28.708
There's someone
that you need to meet.

01:20:50.566 --> 01:20:54.002
Hi, Mom.
- What are you doing here?

01:20:55.504 --> 01:20:58.200
I didn't want you to
think you'd been stood up.

01:20:58.874 --> 01:21:01.172
He's not coming.
- What?

01:21:01.743 --> 01:21:04.576
How do you know? How did
you even know I was here?

01:21:04.680 --> 01:21:06.147
I know, because...

01:21:06.815 --> 01:21:08.077
Because?

01:21:09.651 --> 01:21:11.243
Because I made him up.

01:21:12.154 --> 01:21:13.143
What?

01:21:13.221 --> 01:21:16.486
The flowers and the letters
and the e-mails and everything.

01:21:21.797 --> 01:21:24.322
The phone call?
- A friend of mine did that.

01:21:25.601 --> 01:21:28.968
But it wasn't all made up.
There was a man. There is.

01:21:29.304 --> 01:21:30.965
Most of what I wrote
came from him.

01:21:31.039 --> 01:21:32.939
So there's a man out there
laughing at me, too?

01:21:33.008 --> 01:21:34.703
No! He doesn't know.
He thought...

01:21:34.776 --> 01:21:36.801
How could you be
so cruel?

01:21:39.047 --> 01:21:41.174
I wasn't trying to be cruel.

01:21:42.284 --> 01:21:44.275
I was trying
to make you happy.

01:21:44.820 --> 01:21:47.311
Well, you have a lot
to learn about happiness.

01:21:47.389 --> 01:21:49.380
You haven't exactly
showed me a road map, Mom.

01:21:49.458 --> 01:21:52.916
Oh, so this is my fault. I
brought this humiliation on myself.

01:21:52.995 --> 01:21:55.122
What? Because we moved
around a little bit?

01:21:55.197 --> 01:21:57.290
A little?
- Whatever. A lot.

01:21:57.366 --> 01:21:58.731
You never seemed to mind.

01:21:58.800 --> 01:22:02.861
Yes, I did. You just never heard
any of it if it wasn't about you.

01:22:03.405 --> 01:22:06.067
That is not true. I hear
everything you say to me.

01:22:06.141 --> 01:22:08.405
You hear,
but you don't listen.

01:22:08.677 --> 01:22:10.872
You never listen
to anything I want.

01:22:12.781 --> 01:22:15.477
All right, fine.
What do you want?

01:22:17.119 --> 01:22:20.953
I want a mom that sees in herself
what Zoe and I see every day.

01:22:21.890 --> 01:22:26.259
That's talented
and pretty and funny...

01:22:27.095 --> 01:22:28.824
and cooks great
and dances great...

01:22:28.897 --> 01:22:31.695
and doesn't need a man
to be those things.

01:22:32.300 --> 01:22:34.825
Okay, so maybe
the perfect man wasn't real.

01:22:35.937 --> 01:22:37.837
But the perfect you is.

01:23:02.330 --> 01:23:06.130
S-I-L-E-N-C-E.

01:23:20.415 --> 01:23:21.439
Hi.

01:23:23.218 --> 01:23:24.207
Hi.

01:23:25.253 --> 01:23:27.448
I'm sorry that I didn't
call you back.

01:23:27.522 --> 01:23:30.150
I've been really busy.
- I drew you something.

01:23:34.963 --> 01:23:36.362
"Princess Holly."

01:23:36.431 --> 01:23:38.524
Well, a side of her anyway.

01:23:38.600 --> 01:23:41.467
I realized she doesn't
need an army to protect her.

01:23:42.938 --> 01:23:46.533
You don't let anybody close enough
to hurt you in the first place.

01:23:49.945 --> 01:23:52.004
Wait. Holly!

01:24:02.324 --> 01:24:04.554
I want to move.
- What?

01:24:04.626 --> 01:24:06.116
I hate this place.

01:24:06.194 --> 01:24:08.355
I'm over it,
and I want to move now.

01:24:09.431 --> 01:24:11.991
We've moved more times for
you than I can even count.

01:24:12.067 --> 01:24:14.831
And just this once,
I want to move for me.

01:24:57.112 --> 01:25:00.741
Hi.
- Hi, I'm Adam. Holly's friend.

01:25:00.816 --> 01:25:02.249
Is she home?

01:25:02.317 --> 01:25:04.512
No, she's out
getting packing boxes.

01:25:05.787 --> 01:25:06.947
Why?

01:25:07.022 --> 01:25:09.718
We're moving.
Arizona. Red Rocks.

01:25:12.360 --> 01:25:13.987
You want her to call?

01:25:14.095 --> 01:25:15.289
No.

01:25:18.500 --> 01:25:19.967
Thank you.

01:25:20.769 --> 01:25:23.294
Could you give this to her?

01:25:23.405 --> 01:25:24.531
Sure.

01:25:24.606 --> 01:25:27.939
And tell her she only saw
one side of the drawing.

01:26:32.607 --> 01:26:35.303
I was inspired.

01:26:41.516 --> 01:26:42.540
I miss you.

01:26:43.518 --> 01:26:45.383
Why did you bug out
on me?

01:27:02.070 --> 01:27:03.594
Newsflash.

01:27:04.472 --> 01:27:05.734
Everyone's scared.

01:27:05.874 --> 01:27:08.968
That's no reason
to run away.

01:27:14.816 --> 01:27:16.647
It's what my mom does.

01:27:19.988 --> 01:27:23.048
<i>And you want to end up</i>
<i>like your mom?</i>

01:27:23.925 --> 01:27:25.290
<i>Some role model.</i>

01:27:40.742 --> 01:27:44.405
I heard once that...

01:27:46.014 --> 01:27:49.006
love is friendship on fire.

01:27:50.852 --> 01:27:52.683
That's how I feel
about you.

01:27:55.490 --> 01:27:57.219
Do you really have
to go?

01:28:50.712 --> 01:28:53.840
Holly, guess what?
I get to be in a spelling bee.

01:28:55.550 --> 01:28:56.983
C-O-O-L.

01:28:57.052 --> 01:28:59.043
What are you doing?
- Unpacking.

01:28:59.287 --> 01:29:00.777
Yeah, but why?

01:29:01.022 --> 01:29:04.150
I thought that we all agreed that
it was time for a new adventure.

01:29:04.225 --> 01:29:07.752
This is our new adventure.
Staying is our new adventure.

01:29:07.962 --> 01:29:09.190
What?

01:29:09.931 --> 01:29:12.764
Why can't you ever do
anything that I want?

01:29:20.809 --> 01:29:22.572
I want to be alone.

01:29:23.111 --> 01:29:25.443
Nobody wants to be alone.
- I do.

01:29:25.914 --> 01:29:29.441
Okay, I'm through with these
people and I want new ones.

01:29:33.288 --> 01:29:37.088
Unfortunately, honey pie, new
people are only new for a day.

01:29:37.859 --> 01:29:39.952
After that,
they're just people.

01:29:40.929 --> 01:29:44.160
Who will excite you,
disappoint you...

01:29:46.134 --> 01:29:47.761
scare you a little bit.

01:29:49.204 --> 01:29:52.765
And, boy, I know how tempting it
is to run away when that happens.

01:29:53.441 --> 01:29:57.707
It's good for avoiding things.
But the problem is you end up...

01:29:59.314 --> 01:30:00.941
avoiding yourself.

01:30:03.384 --> 01:30:05.511
Avoiding people you love.

01:30:08.857 --> 01:30:10.916
You end up avoiding life.

01:30:12.527 --> 01:30:17.055
So, I've decided to start
setting an example for you girls.

01:30:19.601 --> 01:30:23.662
I'm going to try showing you
what sticking it out looks like.

01:30:24.139 --> 01:30:26.107
Really get to know people.

01:30:26.541 --> 01:30:28.475
And let people
get to know us.

01:30:28.843 --> 01:30:32.301
I don't promise to be any
good at it, but I will try.

01:30:33.548 --> 01:30:36.779
Because I want you and Zoe to
be better at this than I am.

01:30:38.253 --> 01:30:40.380
I want you to learn
how to let people in.

01:30:55.737 --> 01:30:59.173
He's a sweet boy. I think
it would be worth it.

01:31:00.175 --> 01:31:04.271
Turn it over. Everything
always has two sides.

01:31:43.985 --> 01:31:45.384
You want a bigger ring?

01:31:46.221 --> 01:31:47.449
Combustible.

01:31:48.756 --> 01:31:51.782
C-O-M-B...

01:31:51.859 --> 01:31:54.259
U-S-T...

01:31:54.729 --> 01:31:57.857
I-B-L-E.

01:31:58.366 --> 01:31:59.526
Combustible.

01:31:59.767 --> 01:32:01.325
That is correct.

01:32:09.143 --> 01:32:10.132
J!

01:32:10.211 --> 01:32:11.200
E!

01:32:11.279 --> 01:32:12.268
T!

01:32:12.347 --> 01:32:13.336
S!

01:32:13.581 --> 01:32:15.276
Jets! Jets! Jets!

01:32:18.486 --> 01:32:21.046
Looks like we're going
to the World Series.

01:32:25.360 --> 01:32:27.328
<i> Ladies and gentlemen,
five minutes.</i>

01:32:27.395 --> 01:32:30.728
<i>Five minutes.</i>
<i>We'll be commencing in five minutes.</i>

01:32:32.900 --> 01:32:36.358
First place goes to
Number 73, Jean Hamilton.

01:32:38.906 --> 01:32:40.305
You did it, Mommy!

01:32:56.658 --> 01:32:58.023
Where? The second one?

01:32:58.092 --> 01:32:59.753
Yeah, that's Mom.

01:33:12.440 --> 01:33:13.668
Hi, may I help you?

01:33:13.741 --> 01:33:17.233
Yeah, I heard that
you can find...

01:33:17.312 --> 01:33:19.507
the best fudge brownies
in the world here.

01:33:19.981 --> 01:33:21.209
We try.

01:33:27.121 --> 01:33:28.418
I'll take this.

01:33:35.530 --> 01:33:36.963
Ben.
- Hi.

01:33:40.401 --> 01:33:41.425
On the house.

01:33:41.502 --> 01:33:43.970
No, I have to pay you
somehow.

01:33:45.340 --> 01:33:46.705
How about dinner?

01:33:48.543 --> 01:33:50.272
I don't even know you.

01:33:50.345 --> 01:33:52.313
Well, I don't know
about that.

01:33:52.380 --> 01:33:54.575
Thank you.
That is very sweet.

01:33:57.552 --> 01:33:59.076
But I don't think so.

01:34:01.622 --> 01:34:04.250
Are you dating someone?
- Actually, no.

01:34:04.692 --> 01:34:06.557
For the first time
in my life, I'm not.

01:34:06.627 --> 01:34:08.458
And, and I think
I should stay this way...

01:34:08.529 --> 01:34:10.656
until I get my feet
back on the ground.

01:34:10.732 --> 01:34:12.359
I see. Yeah.

01:34:12.433 --> 01:34:15.266
It's nothing personal.
- No, of course not.

01:34:16.971 --> 01:34:20.031
You know, I should probably
take a dating moratorium, too.

01:34:20.108 --> 01:34:21.200
I recommend it.

01:34:21.275 --> 01:34:23.539
Yeah, clean-out-the-closet
sort of thing.

01:34:23.611 --> 01:34:24.839
It's a good idea.

01:34:24.912 --> 01:34:26.846
You know,
get my head together and1627

01:34:26.914 --> 01:34:28.040
Exactly.

01:34:37.692 --> 01:34:39.819
So, pick you up Saturday
at 8:00?

01:34:40.628 --> 01:34:41.993
Perfect.

01:34:49.237 --> 01:34:52.035
<i> It looks like Mom was right.</i>
<i>Staying turned out to be...</i>

01:34:52.106 --> 01:34:54.131
<i>the greatest adventure of all.</i>

01:34:54.208 --> 01:34:57.371
<i>And let me tell you,</i>
<i>it has made me do some crazy things.</i>

01:34:58.045 --> 01:35:02.141
<i>Like plan ahead and paint my
room  and hang pictures on the wall.</i>

01:35:02.984 --> 01:35:05.248
<i>I mean, I used a nail</i>
<i>and everything.</i>

01:35:19.066 --> 01:35:20.363
Hi, come on in.

01:35:45.059 --> 01:35:46.356
Sorry I'm late.

01:35:46.594 --> 01:35:50.291
There was this Krispy Kreme truck
that overturned on Eighth Avenue.

01:35:58.372 --> 01:35:59.703
Thank you.

01:36:06.214 --> 01:36:08.045
Here, let me deal
with that.

01:36:09.517 --> 01:36:10.779
It goes...

01:36:11.152 --> 01:36:14.280
Relax. What is this?
Like, your first dance or something?

01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:27.331
<i>Can you believe it?</i>

01:36:27.401 --> 01:36:30.007
<i>The Teenage Gypsy has</i>
<i>finally settled down.</i>

01:36:30.738 --> 01:36:34.401
<i>Now I don't just have a homepage.</i>
