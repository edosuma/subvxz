00:36.871 --> 00:38.862
MOHINDER:
Where does it come from?

00:38.956 --> 00:42.949
This quest, this need
to solve life’s mysteries,

00:43.044 --> 00:46.787
when the simplest of questions
can never be answered?

00:48.424 --> 00:52.793
Why are we here?
What is the soul?
Why do we dream?

00:55.139 --> 00:58.097
Perhaps we’d be better off
not looking at all.

00:58.184 --> 01:00.300
Not delving, not yearning.

01:02.521 --> 01:06.309
That’s not human nature.
Not the human heart.

01:08.611 --> 01:10.943
That is not why we are here.

01:26.921 --> 01:28.752
How's he doing?

01:30.675 --> 01:32.211
I'm sorry.
Did I scare you?

01:32.301 --> 01:33.290
No.

01:34.387 --> 01:38.050
No, Ijust... I keep having
these amazing dreams
every time | close my eyes,

01:38.140 --> 01:41.348
and... Never mind.

01:42.853 --> 01:45.595
He likes me to read him
the stock page.

01:45.690 --> 01:48.102
Has he been conscious at all?
No.

01:49.443 --> 01:51.934
Been a week now.
I think he's close.

01:52.029 --> 01:53.405
A couple more
days, maybe.

01:56.993 --> 01:59.951
Excuse me.
You know, I don't know
what he'd do without you.

02:00.037 --> 02:02.289
You got a real gift.
Just doing myjob.

02:02.373 --> 02:04.364
No, you're like
a son to him.

02:05.626 --> 02:07.662
Now, that'd make us
like brother and sister.

02:07.753 --> 02:10.711
Might be... Might be
a little awkward if I ever
wanted to ask you out.

02:14.677 --> 02:17.339
I'm sorry, that was...
That was inappropriate.

02:17.430 --> 02:19.216
No, it's sweet, it's...

02:19.682 --> 02:21.297
I'm dating somebody.

02:21.392 --> 02:23.508
Yeah. No, really,
it's okay.

02:27.982 --> 02:30.098
I need to change his lV.

02:30.484 --> 02:32.395
I'm sorry, of course.

02:36.073 --> 02:39.065
Man is a narcissistic
species by nature.

02:39.785 --> 02:43.243
We have colonized the four
corners of our tiny planet.

02:43.331 --> 02:46.539
But we are not the pinnacle
of so-called evolution.

02:46.792 --> 02:49.579
That honor belongs
to the lowly cockroach.

02:49.962 --> 02:52.669
Capable of living for months
without food.

02:52.757 --> 02:56.966
Remaining alive headless
for weeks at a time.
Resistant to radiation.

02:57.303 --> 03:00.466
If God has indeed created
himself in his own image,

03:00.556 --> 03:03.468
then I submit to you
that God is a cockroach.

03:08.564 --> 03:12.102
They say that man uses
only a tenth
of his brainpower.

03:12.818 --> 03:16.731
Another percent and we might
actually be worthy
of God's image.

03:18.115 --> 03:21.107
Unless, of course, that day
has already arrived.

03:21.285 --> 03:24.869
The Human Genome Project
has discovered
that tiny variations

03:24.955 --> 03:29.039
in man's genetic code
are taking place
at increasingly rapid rates.

03:30.044 --> 03:33.127
Teleportation, levitation,
tissue regeneration.

03:33.422 --> 03:35.754
Is this outside the realm
of possibility?

03:35.841 --> 03:38.878
Or is man entering
a new gateway to evolution?

03:39.220 --> 03:43.680
Is he finally standing
at the threshold
to true human potential?

03:46.727 --> 03:48.809
I'm sorry, I'm out of time.

03:54.819 --> 03:58.311
I know, I know. I'm beginning
to sound like my father.
I can't help it.

03:58.406 --> 04:00.738
You know, they can fire
me, too, if they like,

04:00.825 --> 04:04.158
but there is
something to it, Nirad,
as crazy as it sounds.

04:06.664 --> 04:07.824
What is it?

04:09.125 --> 04:12.288
It's your father.
He's dead.

04:16.465 --> 04:17.500
How?

04:17.591 --> 04:20.583
NIRAD: Driving a taxi
in New York City
is a very dangerous job.

04:20.678 --> 04:22.134
The wrong fare,
the wrong time.

04:22.221 --> 04:23.927
We may never know
what really happened.

04:24.014 --> 04:25.515
No, I spoke to him
two days ago.

04:25.599 --> 04:27.055
He was convinced
someone was following him,

04:27.143 --> 04:28.428
trying to steal
his research.

04:28.519 --> 04:29.679
He died because
of his theories!

04:29.812 --> 04:31.348
That's crazy!
Is it?

04:32.273 --> 04:34.059
The man left his family,

04:34.150 --> 04:37.187
discredited his career,
to chase wild theories
halfway around the world!

04:37.319 --> 04:40.857
Where are you going?
To his apartment, to get
his papers, his research!

04:41.031 --> 04:43.192
He was this close
to finding the
first of them.

04:43.284 --> 04:45.866
His Patient Zero,
he tracked him
to Queens, New York.

04:45.995 --> 04:47.656
Mohinder, listen to me.

04:47.746 --> 04:50.123
Your father was my colleague
and my friend.

04:50.207 --> 04:52.493
A respected professor,
a brilliant geneticist.

04:52.585 --> 04:54.746
But he had clearly
lost touch with reality!

04:54.837 --> 04:56.418
I've followed
in his footsteps.

04:56.505 --> 04:58.006
My thesis is based
on his research!

04:58.090 --> 04:59.876
Yes, you always wanted
his approval!

04:59.967 --> 05:01.958
And now you're
telling me that it
was all for nothing.

05:02.052 --> 05:04.043
I'm telling you to let go.

05:04.138 --> 05:08.677
I need to know why he died.
I need to know that it
wasn't all for nothing.

05:09.143 --> 05:12.010
And then I need to finish
what he started.

06:12.414 --> 06:13.403

06:14.625 --> 06:16.661

but his computer.

Yeah, let's get a team
in here to bag and tag
everything.

08:40.354 --> 08:41.594
What?

08:41.939 --> 08:43.395
Damn it, Micah,
don't do that to me.

08:43.482 --> 08:44.471
Do what?

08:44.817 --> 08:47.775
Just you need
to be careful.
All right?

08:48.195 --> 08:50.527
I'm just working
on my computer.

08:50.614 --> 08:53.777
The logic board was bad,
so I had to build a new one.

08:54.827 --> 08:56.112
A new one.

08:57.621 --> 09:00.704
Did anyone ever tell you
you're the smartest little
man on the planet?

09:00.791 --> 09:02.622
You do.
All the time.

09:06.714 --> 09:08.420
What's this?

09:08.507 --> 09:11.374
It's a pinhole camera.
It's for the eclipse.

09:13.220 --> 09:15.506
The moon's gonna cover up
the sun today.

09:15.597 --> 09:16.928
We're supposed
to look at it
atschoo!

09:17.015 --> 09:21.349

you need to go get ready.
Can't be late, not today.

09:21.437 --> 09:24.224

and I've packed my own lunch.

09:24.314 --> 09:27.272
That's what I've been
doing this morning.
What about you?

09:27.359 --> 09:29.395
Don't get smart with me.

09:29.737 --> 09:31.568
All right, I've been
working to pay our bills.

For a split second,
like I was floating.

I think I can fly!

Mmm-hmm.

you can fly? Why don't you
jump off the Brooklyn Bridge?

12:22.993 --> 12:23.948
See what happens.

12:24.036 --> 12:26.823
Maybe I ought to
start with something
a little lower first.

Just like learning to walk.
You're serious.

out of it, Peter.

is happening to me,

that you're the only person
that's gonna understand this!

about? Why?

the fact that it was so gross
that I almost fudged myself,

18:13.134 --> 18:14.385
Never mind,
I don't wanna know.

18:14.469 --> 18:16.175
Socks.
Socks?

18:18.390 --> 18:20.255
Dad left you a fortune.
What are you thinking?

18:20.350 --> 18:22.181
You know, it's been one
ridiculous stunt
after another with you

18:22.269 --> 18:25.261
for the last six months!
Dad's gone, just get over it!

18:25.355 --> 18:26.686
You know what?
Leave her alone!

18:26.773 --> 18:28.138
She's okay,
that's all that matters.

18:28.233 --> 18:29.894
I gotta keep this
out of the press.

18:31.778 --> 18:33.018
You know what?
Just get out of here.

18:33.113 --> 18:34.694
Go worry
about your image,
I'll handle this.

18:34.864 --> 18:37.480
Yeah. Good.
I gotta make sure
this stays buried.

18:38.201 --> 18:40.317
Thanks a lot, Mom.
Mmm-hmm.

18:45.959 --> 18:47.324
What were you thinking?

18:48.253 --> 18:50.710
I just wanted to feel
alive again.

18:55.885 --> 18:57.671
Nathan only cares
about himself.

18:57.762 --> 19:01.380
Your father was the same way.
Alpha dogs, both of them.

19:01.850 --> 19:05.217
You, in the meantime,
for all your selflessness,

19:05.312 --> 19:08.054
and sitting
with dying people...

19:08.898 --> 19:11.480
What? You're gonna retire
on what you make?

19:11.568 --> 19:14.480
Maybe I'll shoplift my socks.
Don't get smart.

19:14.571 --> 19:17.483
When you put everyone
else first, you end up last.

19:17.574 --> 19:20.031
You always put Nathan first,
he took advantage.

19:20.118 --> 19:23.451
Yeah, it wasn't you
that was just pushing him
right out in front of me?

19:23.538 --> 19:26.951
He takes up
more space than you.
Demanded more attention.

19:27.417 --> 19:29.373
And besides, it's not
my fault, you allowed it.

19:29.461 --> 19:31.417
He's my brother.
I love him.

19:31.504 --> 19:33.415
Ah, love is overrated.

19:33.715 --> 19:36.081
He loves me, too.
I know him.

19:36.634 --> 19:39.171
We've always been close.
Rose-colored glasses.

19:39.262 --> 19:40.763
That's cruel, Mom!

19:42.432 --> 19:45.139
Look, since Dad died, I know
you've been feeling free
to speak your mind,

19:45.226 --> 19:48.639
but it wouldn't hurt
to edit yourself
every once in a while.

19:48.730 --> 19:50.812
I'm sorry
if the truth hurts.

19:51.733 --> 19:54.770
I'm just saying
you hero-worshipped him.

19:55.111 --> 19:56.976
And those feelings
were never returned.

19:57.072 --> 20:00.314
You're wrong!
It's biological,
and I can't help it,

20:01.368 --> 20:02.778
we're connected.

20:06.915 --> 20:10.703
I never told you this,
but when Nathan
had his accident,

20:11.378 --> 20:12.618
I knew it.

20:12.670 --> 20:15.457
We all got the same call.
No, I'm saying
before the call,

20:15.548 --> 20:18.290
like he was telling me,
300 miles away.

20:18.385 --> 20:21.593
lwoke up, and I knew
that he'd been hurt.

20:28.853 --> 20:32.516
I hate it here.
She doesn't even have
any books to read.

20:32.607 --> 20:35.223
Baby, I'll be right back,
I'm just gonna go and
pack up a few things.

20:35.318 --> 20:37.434
We should really
go see Dad.

20:37.821 --> 20:39.357
What good would that do?

20:39.447 --> 20:42.314
He could help.
He should know that
someone's trying to hurt us.

20:42.409 --> 20:45.651
Your dad's not in any position
to help us right now.

20:45.912 --> 20:48.779
Look, I made some mistakes,
I admit it.

20:48.873 --> 20:50.488
Mom, what'd you do?

20:53.586 --> 20:58.296
Hey. I need you to know
that I would never let
anything happen to you.

20:58.675 --> 20:59.915
Promise.

21:00.009 --> 21:03.467
Mom, why'd you look
at yourself like that
in the fish tank?

21:06.516 --> 21:07.847
(SIGHS)

21:11.521 --> 21:14.137
How long?
Just a couple hours, tops.

21:14.232 --> 21:16.689
There's some ice cream
in the fridge.

21:17.152 --> 21:18.437
Go ahead.

21:21.739 --> 21:24.481
What happened?
I went to see Linderman.

21:24.576 --> 21:26.487
How much?
Thirty.

21:26.786 --> 21:29.778
You gambling again?
No, it's just bills.

21:30.123 --> 21:32.205
And I used the rest to get
Micah into private school.

21:32.292 --> 21:35.910
They didn't know what to do
with him at public,
andljust”

21:36.004 --> 21:38.461
I needed them to think
that we had money.

21:38.548 --> 21:40.209
From the mob?

21:41.426 --> 21:42.666
Hell, Niki.

21:43.178 --> 21:46.170
You weren't born yesterday!
I'm just two weeks overdue!

21:46.264 --> 21:48.471
I mean, I thought
that I could handle it,
okay?

21:48.600 --> 21:51.467
I'm under a lot of stress
right now, okay?
Gee, I wonder why?

21:53.730 --> 21:56.062
I feel like I'm kind of
losing it a little bit.

21:59.235 --> 22:01.066
I'm seeing things.

22:01.863 --> 22:02.852
Like?

22:03.823 --> 22:05.734
Like I keep feeling
like someone's watching me.

22:05.825 --> 22:08.032
Yeah, Linderman wants
his money back,

22:08.119 --> 22:10.656
so he sends some
mouth-breather that's gonna
put you in the hospital.

22:10.747 --> 22:12.703
No, it is someone else.

22:14.125 --> 22:16.366
It's someone
that I can't see.

22:19.088 --> 22:21.079
Does this make
any sense to you?

22:25.470 --> 22:26.459
No.

22:29.098 --> 22:31.350
I'm sorry, you know what?
But I'll tell you what does...

22:31.434 --> 22:32.469
I shouldn't be
telling you this.

22:32.560 --> 22:34.096
No, no, let me tell you
what does make sense.

22:34.187 --> 22:38.021
You need to come up
with that 30 grand
plus interest, now.

22:38.107 --> 22:39.688
Or you gotta run.

22:41.277 --> 22:42.392
Watch him.

22:44.614 --> 22:45.603
All right.

23:08.555 --> 23:10.011
Cool, huh?

23:13.268 --> 23:15.304
How hot do you think
it is in there?

23:18.815 --> 23:20.646
Turn on the camera.

24:08.531 --> 24:11.022
Scotty! Scotty! Come on!

24:18.958 --> 24:21.870
Take it easy,
you're all right!
I'm okay, I'm fine!

24:22.754 --> 24:24.085
Take it easy.

24:28.092 --> 24:29.707
There's no burns!

24:32.347 --> 24:33.587
Get going!

24:44.817 --> 24:47.729
One, two, three, four,
five, go!

24:48.571 --> 24:50.152
One, two, three...

24:51.783 --> 24:53.819
MAN: Yeah, I was real sorry
to hear about your father.

24:53.910 --> 24:56.242
He seemed like a good guy.

24:58.247 --> 25:00.829
Man, I thought
I was a slob.

25:01.876 --> 25:03.491
They were here, too.

25:03.586 --> 25:05.201
What?
Nothing.

25:05.296 --> 25:07.082
I got a guy who can clean
this up for 100 bucks.

25:07.173 --> 25:09.414
No. It's all right.
I'll take it as it is.

25:09.509 --> 25:10.919
We rent by the week.

25:11.719 --> 25:13.425
I'm gonna need to know
you can afford it.

25:13.513 --> 25:14.673
I have a job.

25:14.764 --> 25:15.753
Doing what?

25:18.101 --> 25:19.716
Driving a taxi.

25:20.645 --> 25:22.385
I'll get you an application.

26:12.822 --> 26:14.562
MAN ON RAD/O:
In these uncertain times...

26:15.283 --> 26:16.773
We need a leader who...

26:19.954 --> 26:22.991
Nathan Petrelli.
He served his country
in Bosnia.

26:31.132 --> 26:32.417
SIMONE: Hey!

26:34.719 --> 26:37.256
Oh, God. What?
The silent treatment?

26:39.849 --> 26:41.555
Oh, boy.

26:43.478 --> 26:46.686
Isaac? What are you doing?

26:47.982 --> 26:49.688
What the hell is
wrong with you?

26:50.610 --> 26:51.599
Isaac!

26:53.654 --> 26:54.939
Okay, stop!

26:55.198 --> 26:57.154
What... What,
are you crazy?

26:57.241 --> 27:00.699
Clearly.
I don't even remember
painting these.

27:01.621 --> 27:03.953
I was high, okay?
I lied to you.
Damn it.

27:04.791 --> 27:05.780
I've been chasing
for a month.

27:05.875 --> 27:07.365
Well, then, get yourself
back into a program

27:07.460 --> 27:08.950
and make it
stick this time.

27:09.045 --> 27:12.003
These are fantastic!
No! They're evil.

27:12.089 --> 27:13.795
What are you talking about?

27:13.883 --> 27:15.623
What am I talking about?

27:15.718 --> 27:19.381
You know what
I'm talking about?
You see this?

27:20.515 --> 27:23.803
Suicide bombing in Israel.
I painted it three weeks ago.

27:23.893 --> 27:25.008
Yeah, so?

27:26.437 --> 27:28.553
So? That's this
morning's paper.

27:29.190 --> 27:30.600
Look at the number
on the bus.

27:32.652 --> 27:34.643
This happened yesterday.

27:35.738 --> 27:36.727
Yesterday.

27:39.492 --> 27:42.529
Something's wrong with me.

27:43.204 --> 27:44.569
We'll get you help, Isaac.

27:44.664 --> 27:47.406
I tried that, twice.
There's only one way left.

27:47.792 --> 27:49.953
And you know it.
You can't go cold turkey,
not alone!

27:50.044 --> 27:52.786
I mean, let me help you,
please!
No!

27:52.880 --> 27:53.869
I love you!

27:55.508 --> 27:57.669
I'll drag you down with me,
I swear to God, I will.

27:57.760 --> 27:58.920
Just leave me alone.

28:00.096 --> 28:01.256
Get out of here!

28:04.600 --> 28:05.589
Now!

28:13.067 --> 28:16.184
REPORTER: An unidentified
Good Samaritan who
witnesses describe

28:16.279 --> 28:17.610
as a young teenage girl

28:17.697 --> 28:20.814
ran into the flames
and rescued the young
lieutenant.

28:21.117 --> 28:24.575
Now the train is registered
to the Nuclear
Regulatory Commission,

28:24.662 --> 28:28.746
and there has been no
official statement yet
as to what was in the car.

28:28.833 --> 28:32.951
Butjudging by the amount
of security around here...

28:40.303 --> 28:42.885
TOM: (ON SPEAKER PHONE)
It wasn’t easy, Nathan,
but consider it gone.

28:42.972 --> 28:45.384
I know I owe you big
on this one, Tom.
I'm not gonna forget it.

28:45.474 --> 28:47.385
Yeah, / won ’t
let you forget it.

28:47.476 --> 28:49.387
Thanks.
Sure thing.

28:49.478 --> 28:51.605
Mom's rap sheet is now
officially buried.

28:51.689 --> 28:55.102
It only took half my political
capital to pull it off.

28:55.192 --> 28:58.650
Why can't she get herself
a hobby like a normal person?

28:58.905 --> 29:00.611
They were married
41 years.

29:01.782 --> 29:03.568
It's a plea
for attention.

29:03.659 --> 29:06.116
She's lonely.
Give her some time, will you?

29:06.203 --> 29:07.363
I don't have time.

29:07.455 --> 29:09.491
I got eight days
to make up ten points.

29:09.582 --> 29:13.166
I need all the help I can get,
which is what I wanna
talk to you about.

29:13.252 --> 29:15.208
I wanna offer
you a job.

29:15.296 --> 29:17.036
A job?
Yeah.

29:17.131 --> 29:19.622
I trust you.
You're good with people.

29:20.259 --> 29:22.841
I need a coordinator to help
organize the volunteers,

29:22.929 --> 29:24.419
and you got
nice guy instincts,

29:24.513 --> 29:25.798
I could use that.

29:25.973 --> 29:29.306
I'm a shark, Pete,
everybody knows it.

29:29.393 --> 29:31.349
And it's starting
to show up in the polls.

29:31.437 --> 29:34.600
I bring you on, and it kind of
reflects well on me,
you know what I mean?

29:34.690 --> 29:37.602
Yeah, all right,
so I make you look good.
That's a new one.

29:37.693 --> 29:40.275
It makes me look like
I put family first.

29:40.363 --> 29:43.605
I mean, I know that sounds
self-serving, but this is
for you, too, right?

29:43.699 --> 29:45.155
You've got to think
of your future.

29:45.242 --> 29:47.278
How do you do that?
Do what?

29:47.370 --> 29:51.113
Even try to make it look
like it has something
to do with me?

29:51.207 --> 29:53.619
You didn't hear
anything that I said
earlier today, did you?

29:53.709 --> 29:55.620
About how you can fly?
Yeah, I did.

29:55.711 --> 29:58.293
I'm gonna pretend for both
our sakes you didn't say
anything like that.

29:58.381 --> 30:00.838
I'm trying to do
the right thing here.

30:00.925 --> 30:02.131
Look, I already have a job.

30:02.218 --> 30:04.960
Yeah, watching old people die,
now there's a career.

30:05.054 --> 30:06.840
It's not cute
anymore, man.

30:06.931 --> 30:11.015
The dreamy kid, sitting in
the back of the classroom,
staring out the window?

30:11.102 --> 30:12.592
It's time for you
to grow up.

30:13.896 --> 30:17.263
Look, I cast
a big shadow,
Pete, I get it.

30:18.234 --> 30:19.565
Life isn't fair.

30:20.277 --> 30:22.734
But there's nothing
I can do about that.

30:22.989 --> 30:26.197
I'm trying to do
the right thing by you
here, okay?

30:26.283 --> 30:28.490
I don't want your pity.

31:02.486 --> 31:06.525
Hey. Corner of
Center and Canal, please.

31:14.832 --> 31:15.912
Wow.

31:18.377 --> 31:19.913
Solar eclipse.

31:20.004 --> 31:23.246
Yeah, yeah, Iwonder
if it's gonna be total.

31:23.340 --> 31:24.716
Not here, no.

31:24.800 --> 31:28.292
Some other part
of the world, yes.
A global event.

31:28.471 --> 31:31.884
Makes one appreciate
just how small our planet
really is.

31:31.974 --> 31:35.182
And we're all quite small
really, aren't we?

31:37.480 --> 31:38.560
What's your name?

31:38.647 --> 31:39.636
Mohinder.

31:40.149 --> 31:41.389
I'm Peter.

31:42.234 --> 31:43.690
Let me ask you something,
Mohinder.

31:43.778 --> 31:46.986
Do you ever get the feeling
like you were meant

31:47.073 --> 31:49.359
to do something
extraordinary?

31:50.993 --> 31:52.949
I'm driving a cab,
you may have noticed.

31:53.037 --> 31:56.655
No, I'm not talking about
what you do, I'm talking
about who you are.

31:56.749 --> 31:59.991
I'm talking about
being special.

32:00.461 --> 32:02.793
Yes, we are all special.

32:03.422 --> 32:05.504
That's not what I meant.

32:13.557 --> 32:15.422
This is natural selection.

32:15.518 --> 32:18.601
It begins as a single
individual born or hatched

32:18.687 --> 32:21.349
like every other member
of their species, anonymous,

32:21.440 --> 32:22.850
seemingly ordinary,

32:24.026 --> 32:25.266
except they're not.

32:25.569 --> 32:28.936
They carry inside them
the genetic code that will
take their species

32:29.031 --> 32:31.522
to the next
evolutionary rung.

32:33.327 --> 32:34.533
It's destiny.

32:40.042 --> 32:42.533
Hey! Hey,

32:42.628 --> 32:45.290
I can't believe
you just left like that!

32:45.548 --> 32:47.880
Yeah, I know,
I was there.

32:47.967 --> 32:50.629
You saved that dude's life,
he was okay!

34:33.489 --> 34:35.150
Welcome home.

34:45.209 --> 34:46.745
Get over there.

34:46.835 --> 34:48.086
Fifty grand is a lot of money.

34:48.170 --> 34:49.159
Fifty?

34:49.588 --> 34:51.579
It was 30.
Even with interest...

34:51.674 --> 34:53.414
Mr. Linderman wants
to be nice about this.

34:53.509 --> 34:56.251
You should have
read the fine print.

34:57.304 --> 35:00.967
Look, I have a son.
I'm all he's got.

35:01.141 --> 35:02.130
Mmm.

35:05.062 --> 35:06.848
Please, I can get you
the money.

35:06.939 --> 35:08.520
I'll tell you
what I'm gonna do.

35:08.607 --> 35:11.223
I'm gonna make you
a little business
proposition.

35:11.318 --> 35:15.527
You make, what, 40 bucks
for every 20 minutes
you take off your clothes?

35:16.198 --> 35:19.611
Well, I'm gonna give you
a chance to lower
your debt a little.

35:19.702 --> 35:22.068
And see where it goes
from there.

35:24.915 --> 35:25.904
Come on.

35:32.715 --> 35:35.001
Come on,
show me what you got.

35:45.269 --> 35:47.225
Lift up your shirt, baby.

35:49.898 --> 35:51.934
Oh, look at that belly.

35:53.444 --> 35:55.059
Smile for me.

35:56.905 --> 35:58.111
That what you want?

35:58.198 --> 35:59.654
Ah, yes.

36:03.120 --> 36:06.829
What's the matter, baby?
You just started
getting good here.

36:06.915 --> 36:08.655
What's the problem, baby?

36:10.419 --> 36:12.910
I said, what's the matter?

36:15.966 --> 36:16.955
Screw you.

36:17.051 --> 36:18.040
Screw me?

Hello?

39:32.538 --> 39:34.699
Hey! Simone?
Are you busy?

39:34.790 --> 39:37.327
No, I was just
heading home.

39:37.501 --> 39:39.082
Listen, I need you
to meet me at my dad’s.

39:39.169 --> 39:41.546
Yeah, no, I can be there
in 10 minutes.

39:41.672 --> 39:43.913
Just hurry, okay?
Yeah, okay, okay,
I'll see you there. Bye.

39:44.007 --> 39:46.339
You know,
I'll hop out here, please.

39:50.222 --> 39:51.211
Thanks.

40:06.822 --> 40:08.358
Where to, my friend?

40:08.448 --> 40:09.574
JFK, please.

40:17.708 --> 40:19.448
I'm going home
to my family.

40:19.543 --> 40:22.080
These business trips
are wearing me out.

40:23.714 --> 40:24.703
Suresh, huh?

40:26.008 --> 40:27.248
I'm sorry?

40:27.676 --> 40:30.463
Your name.
On your license, there.

40:31.763 --> 40:33.469
That's Indian, yes?

40:35.183 --> 40:40.052
There was a Professor Suresh
at the University of Madras,
a geneticist.

40:40.147 --> 40:41.637
Interesting theories.

40:42.024 --> 40:44.686
Don't think he's teaching
anymore.

40:45.527 --> 40:47.643
But you wouldn't know anything
about that, would you?

40:48.822 --> 40:51.188
Probably lots of Sureshes
where you're from.

40:52.075 --> 40:54.908
Like Smith or Anderson.

41:13.722 --> 41:18.216
And then Carla had
the nerve to tell me
he's not breed-worthy.

41:18.852 --> 41:21.969
Like he didn't win
five all-breed rallies,
two regionals.

41:22.064 --> 41:23.645
Can you believe it?

41:23.982 --> 41:26.268
It's just not true,
Mr. Muggles.

41:26.360 --> 41:29.693
It's not true.
He's a little stud muffin,
that's what he is.

41:30.030 --> 41:32.316
He still humps my leg
when I watch TV.

41:32.407 --> 41:35.114
All right, enough
about Mr. Muggles.

41:35.410 --> 41:37.321
What'd everybody else
do today?

41:37.412 --> 41:39.403
Doug and I saw
this Mexican guy.

41:39.498 --> 41:41.238
A homeless dude,
on our way to school.

41:41.792 --> 41:44.329
We thought he was dead,
but he wasn't.

41:45.754 --> 41:47.460
I thought Dad
was coming home today.

41:47.547 --> 41:49.708
Well, ah, Iwas gonna
surprise you.

41:53.095 --> 41:54.960
Just in time to read
my report card.

41:55.055 --> 41:58.138
So what about you, Claire,
do anything special today?

42:03.313 --> 42:05.929
I walked through fire
and I didn't get burned.

42:10.946 --> 42:12.652
What the hell is that
supposed to mean?

42:12.739 --> 42:15.196
God, you're so
crazy sometimes.
Lyle.

42:17.035 --> 42:19.868
I think I know exactly
what you mean.

42:19.955 --> 42:23.072
Oh, here I am,
talking dogs again.

42:23.166 --> 42:26.124
And you go and say
something really profound.

42:27.254 --> 42:30.212
We come up against
all kinds of fires
in our lives,

42:30.298 --> 42:33.461
and when we test ourselves
and face our fears,

42:34.094 --> 42:36.050
we usually
don't get burned.

42:36.304 --> 42:39.011
You are very wise,
sweetheart.

42:39.099 --> 42:43.263
Whatever it is you did,
I'm proud of you.
And so is Mr. Muggles!

42:43.729 --> 42:46.892
He's just so proud of Claire!
Aren't we?
We're proud of Claire.

42:46.982 --> 42:49.348
Yes, we're so proud
of Claire, aren't we?

42:49.484 --> 42:51.020
She's the best.

44:01.515 --> 44:02.721
Hiro.

44:13.902 --> 44:16.314
What are you looking for?

44:16.404 --> 44:17.655
Morphine.

44:17.739 --> 44:19.149
What for?

44:19.491 --> 44:20.981
I need you to come
with me someplace.

44:21.076 --> 44:22.612
Where?
You'll see.

44:23.620 --> 44:25.827
Look, there's...
There's something
I need to tell you.

44:25.914 --> 44:27.779
Now that is gonna
have to wait.

44:27.874 --> 44:30.160
No, look, I need to
tell you about this, okay?

44:30.252 --> 44:32.038
I've gotta stop living
for other people.

44:32.128 --> 44:34.835
My whole life
I've had no idea
what I'm supposed to do,

44:34.923 --> 44:37.585
what I'm supposed
to be, if I even have
a destiny of my own!

44:37.676 --> 44:39.917
I promise you we will
talk about this later, okay?

44:40.011 --> 44:42.502
But right now I really
need you to come with me.

44:42.597 --> 44:46.556
You're a nurse,
you can give out a shot,
you can help him.

44:46.643 --> 44:47.632
Help who?

44:50.105 --> 44:52.721
I thought we could go
to the movies this Saturday,

44:52.983 --> 44:57.773
maybe try on some shoes
at the new mail
in Gardendale.

44:59.906 --> 45:00.895
Sure.

45:03.368 --> 45:04.983
I love you, Mom.

45:06.329 --> 45:07.318
But?

45:11.126 --> 45:12.332
No buts.

45:13.044 --> 45:14.830
I just wanted
to tell you that.

45:15.672 --> 45:18.630
I know you think I'm trying
to be your best friend again,
admit it.

45:18.717 --> 45:19.706
No.

45:20.427 --> 45:24.215
It's all right, we can go
to the movies together.
It's no big deal.

45:24.306 --> 45:27.764
Ijust miss you,
that's all.

45:29.603 --> 45:33.767
I wanna be your mom,
I wanna give you advice.

45:33.940 --> 45:36.477
But I don't wanna
push you away.

45:36.568 --> 45:38.399
I want advice, I do.

45:39.696 --> 45:42.312
I won't push you away,
I promise.

45:47.162 --> 45:51.997
Ijust don't think
you should be so worried
about fitting in all the time.

45:52.834 --> 45:54.950
About being so popular.

45:55.045 --> 45:57.752
I don't want to see you make
mistakes like I did.

45:57.839 --> 46:01.331
I wanted to be someone
more interesting than I am.

46:02.052 --> 46:05.590
You are interesting.
You breed show dogs.
Whose mom does that?

46:06.473 --> 46:09.431
No, I wanted to hitchhike
across Europe.

46:09.809 --> 46:14.519
Study art.
Fall in love with some
poetry-quoting Frenchman.

46:15.106 --> 46:17.848
Not that your dad isn't
wonderful, but my point is,

46:18.276 --> 46:21.609
you should
know who you are
and know that it's enough.

46:21.696 --> 46:24.483
'Cause who you are
is special.

46:27.285 --> 46:28.274
About that.

46:30.538 --> 46:32.665
There's something
I need to say.

46:33.708 --> 46:37.667
Something I never talked about
'cause I thought it would
upset you and Dad.

46:37.879 --> 46:41.371
Sweetheart, you can say
anything to us, you know that.

46:44.135 --> 46:47.047
I think I'm old enough
for you to tell me who
my real parents are.

46:51.184 --> 46:52.469
Of course you are.

46:56.856 --> 46:59.393
Honey! I'm home!

46:59.818 --> 47:01.024
Your father.

47:04.114 --> 47:06.105
Hey,honey!

47:08.034 --> 47:10.821
Bad, Mr. Muggles!
No!

47:13.540 --> 47:15.531
I'm glad you're home.
Oh, me, too.

47:15.625 --> 47:19.083
I have such a headache.
I slammed my head getting
out of a taxicab.

47:19.170 --> 47:20.159
Hi, Daddy!

47:23.091 --> 47:24.581
Hey,baby!

48:39.250 --> 48:40.911
(EXCLAIMING)

48:41.669 --> 48:44.627
Hello, New York!

48:45.465 --> 48:48.252
PETER: I'm just saying
it's impossible. Nobody can
predict the future.

48:48.343 --> 48:51.756
I saw it with my own eyes,
Peter. Isaac! I brought
someone here to help.

48:51.846 --> 48:53.177
He's a nurse.

48:55.100 --> 48:56.089
Isaac.

48:58.686 --> 48:59.675
Isaac?

49:04.025 --> 49:05.014
Isaac?

49:07.362 --> 49:08.351
Isaac!

49:09.489 --> 49:11.195
Simone!

49:11.282 --> 49:13.147
Oh, God!

49:13.243 --> 49:14.232
Okay.

49:14.953 --> 49:16.534
Oh, my God.
Isaac?

49:16.621 --> 49:19.203
He's alive. Call 911.

49:19.999 --> 49:21.990
What have you done?

49:24.879 --> 49:26.915
God, he's overdosed.

49:31.302 --> 49:35.841
Yeah, I'm at 215 Reed Street,
number seven.

49:35.932 --> 49:39.845
I need an ambulance here
immediately. He's OD'd.

49:40.895 --> 49:44.683
No, no, he's conscious.
Just barely.

49:45.900 --> 49:48.232
I know. Listen,
could you just come?

49:48.444 --> 49:50.776
Get here soon, please.

49:53.408 --> 49:56.900
Okay, baby, it's okay,
they're sending an ambulance
right now, okay?

49:56.995 --> 50:00.908
You just hang in there, okay?
You're gonna be okay, I swear.

50:05.753 --> 50:07.459
We have to stop it.

50:11.092 --> 50:14.084
(CRYING) Oh, baby.
We have to stop it.

50:26.024 --> 50:30.939
MOH/NDER: This quest,
this need to solve
life ’s mysteries.

50:32.822 --> 50:36.406
In the end, what does it
matter when the human heart
can only find meaning

50:36.492 --> 50:38.949
in the smallest of moments?

50:40.496 --> 50:43.624
They’re here among us.

50:45.293 --> 50:49.536
In the shadows,
in the light. Everywhere.

50:52.425 --> 50:54.757
Do they even know yet?

51:08.316 --> 51:11.934
All right, I'm here.
Now what do you want?

51:14.697 --> 51:15.686
Peter?

51:22.747 --> 51:25.910
I've been up here all night
thinking about this.

51:26.668 --> 51:28.750
Thinking about my destiny.

51:29.671 --> 51:31.036
What are you doing, Pete?

51:31.339 --> 51:34.046
It's my turn to be somebody
now, Nathan!

51:34.634 --> 51:36.920
Come on, Peter,
quit screwing around!

52:19.721 --> 52:21.006
Peter!

52:21.097 --> 52:22.758
(BOTH GRUNTING)

52:27.895 --> 52:31.479
You're flying, Nathan.
You're flying.

52:32.233 --> 52:34.519
How did you...
I don't know.

52:38.865 --> 52:40.730
No! No!
