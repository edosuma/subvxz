01:31.493 --> 01:34.252
But mon cher ami, how
can you be so calm?

01:34.392 --> 01:37.921
This monster, Bonaparte, he's
crossed into Austria now,

01:37.946 --> 01:40.345
and who's to say that
Russia won't be next?

01:40.346 --> 01:44.265
No, no, no. Our illustrious
Emperor has it all in hand.

01:44.266 --> 01:48.105
Our great army will stop this
monster Napoleon in his tracks.

01:48.106 --> 01:50.185
You must remember, dear Anna Pavlovna,

01:50.186 --> 01:52.105
Russia hasn't lost a war in 100 years.

01:53.586 --> 01:54.666
I do beg your pardon. I'm so sorry.

01:54.879 --> 01:57.518
Who is that young man? I'm
sure I didn't invite him.

01:57.519 --> 02:00.135
Ah. My young relative, I regret to say.

02:00.160 --> 02:03.559
Count Bezukhov's son. His
natural son, of course.

02:03.560 --> 02:05.759
Did he have any other kind?
(ANNA LAUGHS)

02:05.760 --> 02:07.399
Indeed.

02:07.400 --> 02:11.279
But this one was something of
a favourite, God knows why.

02:11.280 --> 02:14.080
He's staying with me, now he's back in St.
Petersburg.

02:15.800 --> 02:19.279
Well, please don't bring him again.
He looks like a wild animal,

02:19.280 --> 02:24.732
so unlike your own lovely children.
Such beautiful creatures!

02:26.560 --> 02:29.159
Look at Papa, scheming away.

02:29.160 --> 02:32.079
I think he's negotiating
to get you into a nunnery.

02:32.080 --> 02:33.879
If he did, would you rescue me?

02:33.880 --> 02:36.599
No. I'd say, "Thank God
and good riddance."

02:36.600 --> 02:37.999
Beast!

02:38.000 --> 02:40.359
Please, Mother, it's embarrassing!

If you don't ask, you don't get.
Prince Vassily!

02:44.400 --> 02:45.760
Prince Vassily.

02:47.120 --> 02:50.089
You know, I've never
asked you for anything.

02:50.114 --> 02:53.519
I've never reminded you of
what my father did for you,

02:54.514 --> 02:56.968
but now, I beg you, for my boy, Boris,

02:57.554 --> 03:00.142
a word from you to the
sovereign would be enough.

03:00.914 --> 03:02.201
I'll do what I can.

03:02.554 --> 03:05.353
What is it you wish for the
boy, Anna Mikhailovna?

03:05.354 --> 03:08.913
Get him a commission in the Guards
and recommend him to the General.

03:08.914 --> 03:10.685
You know a word from you would do it.

03:10.710 --> 03:13.482
You know, my influence is nothing
like what you imagine...

03:14.490 --> 03:16.889
but I am seeing the sovereign
later this evening.

03:16.890 --> 03:18.412
Oh, thank you, thank you!

03:20.410 --> 03:21.841
I know I can trust you.

03:22.570 --> 03:26.489
And when you come into your
inheritance, you will remember

03:26.490 --> 03:30.449
Count Bezukhov promised a regular
allowance for my poor boy?

03:30.450 --> 03:31.888
I know nothing of that.

03:32.730 --> 03:36.000
And don't you think you've had
enough from the Bezukhov family?

03:37.270 --> 03:39.110
Go and beg elsewhere.

03:47.504 --> 03:50.089
Napoleon has utterly
destroyed his own country.

03:50.090 --> 03:51.489
No, no, that's not right!

03:51.490 --> 03:54.525
France is no longer a place where
civilised people can live.

03:54.550 --> 03:55.731
Oui, oui, c'est vrai, c'est
vrai, malheuresement.

03:55.790 --> 03:58.189
- I say Napoleon is a great man, sir!
- Outrageous!

03:58.190 --> 04:00.109
You think so, monsieur?

04:00.384 --> 04:04.663
- Shall we go to that table over there?
- No, no, I must say this.

04:04.664 --> 04:06.743
Yes, of course Napoleon's a great man!

04:07.032 --> 04:10.031
He stood above the revolution,
he put an end to its abuses

04:10.032 --> 04:11.711
and kept all that was good about it!

04:11.712 --> 04:13.671
You see good in revolution, sir?

04:13.672 --> 04:16.711
The equality of all citizens,
freedom of speech,

04:16.712 --> 04:18.471
liberty, equality, fraternity,

04:18.471 --> 04:21.190
these are ideas we could
learn from in Russia.

04:21.192 --> 04:24.271
Our drawing rooms are full
of overfed aristocrats

04:24.272 --> 04:26.231
who have no idea what real life is,

04:26.232 --> 04:29.511
who have even forgotten how
to speak their own language!

04:29.512 --> 04:31.832
By God, we could do
with a revolution here!

04:33.552 --> 04:36.868
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have...
It was just...

04:38.272 --> 04:41.053
- Pierre, old friend.
- Andrei!

04:42.992 --> 04:44.792
It's so good to see you here.

04:46.792 --> 04:48.791
Getting a taste of high society?

04:48.792 --> 04:50.980
Yes. Making a fool of myself, as usual.

04:51.712 --> 04:55.711
You will excuse me, my
dear Anna Pavlovna.

04:55.712 --> 04:57.191
We must take our leave now,

04:57.192 --> 05:00.231
a reception I must attend
at the ambassador's.

05:00.232 --> 05:01.832
Goodnight, goodnight.

05:07.112 --> 05:08.312
Having fun?

05:09.872 --> 05:12.261
Listen, come round for a drink
tonight, we'll make a night of it.

05:20.872 --> 05:22.112
She's ravishing.

05:24.392 --> 05:25.751
No hope for me, though.

05:25.752 --> 05:28.712
I see her every day and she
hardly notices I'm there.

05:30.712 --> 05:32.974
But your lovely wife? Is she well?

05:33.632 --> 05:34.866
See for yourself.

05:35.672 --> 05:37.191
She's enchanting.

05:37.192 --> 05:40.049
A woman like that spreads
happiness wherever she goes.

05:40.672 --> 05:42.165
You're a lucky dog, Andrei!

05:43.032 --> 05:43.962
You think?

05:49.272 --> 05:50.791
Has he told you?

05:50.792 --> 05:53.311
He's going off to the war and
sending me away to the country

05:53.312 --> 05:55.071
to have my baby all alone.

05:55.072 --> 05:57.671
That's the sort of husband I've got!
Are you really?

05:57.672 --> 06:00.031
She won't be alone, she'll be
with my father and sister.

06:00.032 --> 06:03.591
But to have my baby in that bleak
place, with people I hardly know.

06:03.592 --> 06:06.115
Lise, we have been through all
this, you know it's for the best.

06:06.512 --> 06:09.151
Now, take the carriage home. The
doctor said you should rest.

06:09.152 --> 06:12.380
I'll walk with Pierre. You see?
He treats me like a child.

06:12.405 --> 06:12.687
Lise...

06:12.712 --> 06:15.791
No. I don't care if
Monsieur Pierre hears it!

06:15.792 --> 06:19.192
You have no pity for me. You
were never like this before.

06:23.232 --> 06:24.432
You see?

06:26.072 --> 06:27.951
I don't believe he loves me any more!

06:27.952 --> 06:30.151
Dear Princess, please don't be upset.

06:30.152 --> 06:32.551
I understand how you feel.
Although, how could I?

06:32.552 --> 06:35.393
Not being a... But... Life is very...

06:35.418 --> 06:38.671
No, this is all wrong. This is
none of my business. I should go.

06:38.672 --> 06:41.551
- I should leave you...
- No, no, no, don't. I'll be good.

06:41.552 --> 06:43.552
I know Andrei wants to talk to you.

06:48.232 --> 06:50.432
- You won't be too long?
- No, my love.

06:52.392 --> 06:53.752
Goodnight, Pierre.

07:05.632 --> 07:07.391
You're really going to the war?

07:07.392 --> 07:10.191
You don't think Napoleon's the
Antichrist, like the rest of them?

07:10.192 --> 07:12.471
- It's got nothing to do with Napoleon.
- Then why?

07:12.472 --> 07:13.920
Because I can't bear
any more of this life!

07:14.472 --> 07:18.232
Drawing rooms, gossip, balls,
vanity, night after night.

07:19.752 --> 07:21.521
Don't look at me like
that, it's the truth.

07:22.192 --> 07:24.551
Never marry, Pierre.
Don't make my mistake.

07:24.552 --> 07:27.071
But Lise's not like that. She's
the gentlest, sweetest...

07:27.072 --> 07:28.511
Oh, I know, I know.

07:28.512 --> 07:30.711
She's a wonderful woman
and I love her dearly,

07:30.712 --> 07:32.952
but I can't breathe here, Pierre.

07:34.472 --> 07:37.111
I might as well get myself
killed fighting Napoleon.

07:37.112 --> 07:40.431
But you're the most brilliant man I know.
You could do anything.

07:40.432 --> 07:41.992
So they say.

07:43.752 --> 07:45.271
And what about you?

07:45.272 --> 07:47.471
Have you decided what
you're going to do yet?

07:47.472 --> 07:49.311
Can you imagine? I still don't know.

07:49.312 --> 07:51.791
But I do think I could
make something of my life,

07:51.792 --> 07:53.711
do something extraordinary, even.

07:53.712 --> 07:55.380
Lead the revolution, perhaps?

07:56.472 --> 07:57.991
I know, I deserve to be mocked.

07:57.992 --> 08:00.911
- If you could see how I waste my nights...
- Ah, yes, well...

08:00.912 --> 08:02.471
If you're asking for my advice,

08:02.472 --> 08:04.811
I'd chuck Anatole
Kuragin and that gang.

08:05.512 --> 08:07.513
That sort of debauchery
doesn't suit you.

08:08.512 --> 08:11.831
Ah, but the women... The
women and the wine...

08:11.832 --> 08:14.751
But yes, no, you're right. I've
been thinking that myself,

08:14.752 --> 08:17.328
I should stop going round there.
I will stop.

08:18.296 --> 08:19.216
There!

08:19.912 --> 08:20.801
You promise?

08:21.112 --> 08:21.953

Your father is gravely ill in Moscow.

09:26.712 --> 09:27.792
I am leaving immediately.

09:27.938 --> 09:30.437
Yes, of course. Did he ask for me?

09:36.632 --> 09:37.885
You're in trouble.

09:38.192 --> 09:40.847
You've been a very bad boy.
I'm really quite shocked.

09:41.632 --> 09:43.031
I'm a damned soul.

11:23.072 --> 11:24.991

11:24.992 --> 11:26.951

by the time we arrive.

Catiche has sacrificed,

see you're not left destitute.

little to deserve it.

12:13.752 --> 12:16.431
I'll just call in on the Rostovs.
It's Natasha's name day!

12:16.432 --> 12:18.591
I will come to the
house, it's just that...

son Pierre will surely kill him.

12:37.712 --> 12:41.191
He and Anatole Kuragin and
that dreadful Dolokhov,

12:41.192 --> 12:43.271

- (LAUGHTER)

12:43.272 --> 12:44.671
- A bear?
- That Pierre!

12:44.672 --> 12:48.951
..and put it in a carriage and went to...
to the actresses, you know,

12:48.952 --> 12:52.751
and the bear got out. And
when the police came... Oh.

12:52.752 --> 12:54.271
It's too shocking to say.

12:54.272 --> 12:56.471
No, say it, please, Aunt Anna!

12:56.472 --> 12:59.871
They tied the bear to the
policeman, back to back,

12:59.872 --> 13:01.671
- and threw them into the river!
- (LAUGHTER)

13:01.672 --> 13:03.751

13:03.752 --> 13:05.071
Oh, he was very well!

13:05.072 --> 13:07.471
He went swimming about with
the policeman on his back!

13:07.472 --> 13:10.991

That poor policeman!

No, no, you're quite right.
You shouldn't laugh, Natasha!

13:17.232 --> 13:18.511
You were laughing too.

13:18.512 --> 13:20.911
Yes, but you mustn't take
me as a model of behaviour.

13:20.912 --> 13:23.111
So, what happened with the young men?

13:23.112 --> 13:25.391

Petersburg in disgrace.

13:28.912 --> 13:31.831
Thank God my dear boy Boris
has stayed away from Anatole

13:31.832 --> 13:33.471
and his drunken clique!

13:33.472 --> 13:36.311
Your son does you great
credit, Anna Mikhailovna!

13:36.312 --> 13:39.591
He looks so elegant in
his Guards' uniform!

14:20.592 --> 14:25.219
Yes. I thought I'd...
come in the back way.

- (LAUGHTER)
- Monsieur Bezukhov.

14:31.272 --> 14:34.151
Oh! Pierre, my dear fellow!

14:34.152 --> 14:36.911
We've just been hearing all about
you and your dear bear friend.

14:36.912 --> 14:38.991
Oh, please, please, don't mention it.

14:38.992 --> 14:40.471
I'm so ashamed of myself.

14:40.472 --> 14:42.871
I just wanted to come and see
Natasha on her name day.

14:42.872 --> 14:45.271

Yes, yes. I've been a
poor sort of son to him.

21:45.290 --> 21:47.250
The Count has asked for Pierre.

21:50.450 --> 21:54.409
At times like this, Catiche,
one must think of everything.

21:54.410 --> 21:56.129
We must think about the future.

21:56.130 --> 22:00.405
Ah, cousin Vassily, I think
nothing of such things.

22:01.570 --> 22:03.538
There's only one thing I pray for,

22:04.170 --> 22:06.609

depart this world...

22:06.610 --> 22:08.155
Yes, yes, that goes without saying.

But do you have his
will in safe keeping?

- His true will, I mean.
- Yes, of course.

when his mind was disturbed...

22:22.930 --> 22:25.249
He has made many wills over the years,

22:25.830 --> 22:28.150
but he cannot leave
the estate to Pierre.

I know you think I am
stupid, but I know this,

22:34.290 --> 22:37.006

Un batard! But didn't the
Count write to the Emperor

22:40.290 --> 22:42.649
to say he recognised Pierre as his son?

22:42.650 --> 22:45.369
Yes, yes, but it was never sent.
And what does it matter, anyway?

22:45.370 --> 22:47.849
Don't you see? If it's
discovered in his papers,

22:47.850 --> 22:50.649
Pierre will be Count Bezukhov

23:17.690 --> 23:19.319
He wouldn't want that.

23:19.690 --> 23:23.129
In any case, he surely has
forgotten about it by now

23:23.130 --> 23:26.689

33:10.410 --> 33:11.739
All right, I'll do it.

33:12.650 --> 33:15.489
- (PRINCE BOLKONSKY CHUCKLES)
- It's a bad business, isn't it?

33:15.490 --> 33:16.603
What is, father?

33:17.410 --> 33:19.549
Women. Marriage.

33:19.810 --> 33:21.929
They're all the same, nothing
to be done about it.

33:21.930 --> 33:23.929
No use unmarrying them.

33:23.930 --> 33:26.010
But don't worry, I won't tell anyone.

33:27.986 --> 33:30.705
But we'll take care of her.
She'll want for nothing.

33:30.730 --> 33:32.061
She's a pretty little thing.

33:32.810 --> 33:35.289
Now, listen, take this to Kutuzov.

33:35.290 --> 33:37.409
Tell him I remember him and love him.

33:37.410 --> 33:40.009
Stay with him, learn from him
and you won't go far wrong.

33:40.010 --> 33:41.489
Thank you, Father.

33:41.490 --> 33:43.730
Very well. Goodbye, then.

33:46.170 --> 33:49.329
And remember, if you are
killed, I shall be pained.

33:49.330 --> 33:51.569
But if I learn that
you have not behaved

33:51.570 --> 33:54.032
like the son of Nikolai
Bolkonsky, I shall be ashamed.

33:54.770 --> 33:56.569
You had no need to tell me that.

33:56.570 --> 34:00.130
Yes, well, we've said our goodbyes.
Off with you.

34:03.028 --> 34:04.548
Off with you, I say!

34:14.889 --> 34:16.688
What is it? What's wrong?

34:16.690 --> 34:19.969
Nothing's wrong. It's just his way.
You know what he's like.

34:19.969 --> 34:22.530
Andrei, one thing, before you go...

34:24.210 --> 34:27.009
I know... I know you don't believe

34:27.010 --> 34:29.050
but, for my sake, will you wear it?

34:30.250 --> 34:33.196
Father's father wore it
all through the wars

34:33.610 --> 34:37.248
and it'll help me not to worry too
much, if I know you were wearing it.

34:37.250 --> 34:39.449
Please, Andrei...

34:41.290 --> 34:42.610
..for me.

34:51.728 --> 34:53.168
Well, for you.

34:59.130 --> 35:00.290
Thank you.

35:02.210 --> 35:04.489
(LISE SOBS IN THE NEXT ROOM)

35:04.490 --> 35:06.282
I'd better say my farewell to her.

35:06.770 --> 35:08.849
Be kind to her, Andrei.

35:08.850 --> 35:11.129
- Why would I be anything else?
- (SHE SIGHS)

35:11.130 --> 35:14.169
Andrei, if you had faith, you
would have turned to God

35:14.170 --> 35:16.329
and asked him for the
love you don't feel.

35:16.354 --> 35:18.234
Yes, if only it were that simple.

35:25.530 --> 35:26.889
Already?

35:26.890 --> 35:28.530
Can't be helped, I'm afraid.

35:47.410 --> 35:49.889
Stay, please.

35:49.890 --> 35:51.969
No!

35:51.994 --> 35:54.739
No! No, please, no!

35:57.090 --> 36:00.050
(LISE WEEPS)

36:01.930 --> 36:03.250
Take care of her.

36:16.090 --> 36:18.049
Oh, Nikolai.

36:18.050 --> 36:20.449
Be careful, my dear.

36:20.450 --> 36:21.929
Don't put yourself in any danger!

36:21.930 --> 36:25.410
Mama, please don't fuss. I am a man now...
so is Boris.

36:30.930 --> 36:33.849
Don't they look fine in their uniforms?

36:33.850 --> 36:37.289
I can't bear to look for fear of
thinking what may happen to them.

36:37.290 --> 36:40.450
Don't say that. They'll come
home safe, I'm sure of it.

36:44.170 --> 36:45.929
I wish I could come with you.

36:45.930 --> 36:48.049
I'd chop old Bonaparte down, like this!

36:48.050 --> 36:49.289
I bet you would!

36:49.314 --> 36:51.633
- Will we ever see our boy again?
- There, there, my dear.

36:51.634 --> 36:54.569
- War is a terrible thing!
- What has to be must be...

36:54.570 --> 36:56.009
and boys will be boys.

36:56.010 --> 36:58.569
I'm going to make you
proud of me, Papa.

36:58.781 --> 37:01.341
I know you will, my son. I know.

37:41.194 --> 37:42.554
Let's go.

37:50.770 --> 37:52.090
Bye!

38:09.090 --> 38:13.462
They've marched a thousand miles,
but are in excellent shape.

38:14.730 --> 38:17.169
You issued my order? Yes, your Grace.

38:17.170 --> 38:19.889
We march tomorrow to join with
General Mack's army at Ulm.

38:19.890 --> 38:22.798
And that's where we'll stop
Napoleon in his tracks...

38:23.450 --> 38:24.770
God willing.

38:26.290 --> 38:29.449
General Mack and the Austrian army
will be defending this approach.

38:29.450 --> 38:32.769
We will attack the French
from the East, here.

38:32.770 --> 38:34.769
I tell you, I must see the General!

38:34.770 --> 38:39.065
- I tell you, he is busy! I insist...
- Go and see what that row is about.

38:39.066 --> 38:41.505
As soon as he is available, I
will let him know you are here.

38:41.530 --> 38:44.249
Until then, you will have to wait.
I must see General Kutuzov.

38:44.250 --> 38:46.361
As soon as he is available, I...

38:46.970 --> 38:50.009
What is it? You may give
your message to me.

38:50.010 --> 38:52.690
With respect, are you General Kutuzov?

38:54.326 --> 38:56.006
I am Kutuzov.

38:59.210 --> 39:04.329
Your Grace, you see before you
the unfortunate General Mack.

39:04.330 --> 39:07.729
What are you doing here? We
were to join forces at Ulm.

39:07.730 --> 39:12.089
Napoleon outflanked us. We
suffered terrible losses.

39:12.090 --> 39:14.809
I was obliged to offer
him our surrender.

39:14.810 --> 39:16.130
What?

39:20.616 --> 39:21.976
The whole army?

39:23.685 --> 39:25.325
70,000 men?

39:26.770 --> 39:28.330
With regret, your Grace.

39:37.170 --> 39:40.369
Might I ask, sir, what
are we going to do now?

39:40.370 --> 39:41.530
A good question.

39:42.730 --> 39:45.329
We will retreat, of course.

39:45.330 --> 39:47.209
Is that really all we can do, sir?

39:47.210 --> 39:48.969
Our reinforcements are on their way.

39:48.970 --> 39:51.049
We will retreat until we
can join up with them

39:51.050 --> 39:53.283
and the other Austrian divisions.

39:54.130 --> 39:55.569
This has been a bad set-back,

39:55.570 --> 39:58.010
but the way to survive
it is to be prudent.

39:59.210 --> 40:02.250
They call me the general who
doesn't like to fight...

40:05.330 --> 40:10.455
..but only a fool would sacrifice
good men for a bit of glory.

40:18.170 --> 40:20.489
So, what's the matter
with you, young Rostov?

40:20.490 --> 40:21.929
Nothing at all, Captain,

40:21.930 --> 40:23.531
except retreat isn't
what I went to war for.

40:23.556 --> 40:24.097
I know.

40:24.650 --> 40:28.198
You want to put that fine young horse
of yours through his paces, eh?

40:28.199 --> 40:30.305
Well, you'll get your
chance, by and by,

40:30.790 --> 40:32.910
and you may not care
for it when you do.

40:33.450 --> 40:35.849
- What's it like, Denisov?
- What's what like?

40:35.850 --> 40:39.009
Actually, you know, being in combat.

40:39.010 --> 40:41.730
Bloody awful, if you're
on the losing side.

40:43.010 --> 40:46.089
But seriously, it's one of those
things no-one can tell you about.

40:46.090 --> 40:48.080
You have to experience it for yourself,

40:49.010 --> 40:51.369
like being with a woman
for the first time.

40:51.370 --> 40:54.409
Can be wonderful. Can be terrifying.

40:54.410 --> 40:56.850
(DENISOV CHUCKLES) You'll find out.

41:04.010 --> 41:05.861
No word from Nikki yet.

41:06.250 --> 41:08.529
Do you think they've
forgotten all about us?

41:08.530 --> 41:10.244
I wouldn't be surprised if they had.

41:10.770 --> 41:12.849
It's all right for them,
they get to do things.

41:12.850 --> 41:14.315
We just have to sit about and wait.

41:16.460 --> 41:19.540
But to think of Nikolai in
danger, I can't bear it.

41:21.250 --> 41:23.489
He used to cry when he fell
over and hurt his knee,

41:23.490 --> 41:25.369
and now he has to face bullets...

41:25.370 --> 41:26.690
Don't.

41:27.850 --> 41:29.791
Do you think about him all the time?

41:30.570 --> 41:31.799
Of course I do.

41:32.170 --> 41:33.947
Do you remember him really well?

41:34.450 --> 41:37.489
Remember exactly how he looks
and everything he said to you?

41:37.490 --> 41:40.610
- Yes, of course.
- I do too, Nikolai, I mean.

41:44.410 --> 41:47.929
When I think of Boris, I can't
really remember him at all,

41:47.930 --> 41:49.969
even though he kissed me.

41:49.970 --> 41:52.736
I try to remember him, but
somehow his face doesn't come.

41:55.050 --> 41:56.518
No, nothing.

41:56.908 --> 41:58.929
Isn't that terrible?

41:58.930 --> 42:01.049
That's because you
don't really love him,

42:01.050 --> 42:03.369
not in the way I love Nikolai.

42:03.370 --> 42:06.089
I just know that I'll
always love Nikolai.

42:06.090 --> 42:08.649
Whatever happens to him,
whatever happens to me,

42:08.650 --> 42:10.729
whether he loves me or not,

42:10.890 --> 42:13.393
I shall be in love
with him all my life.

42:14.090 --> 42:16.533
Will you write to him and tell
him how much you love him?

42:17.130 --> 42:18.026
He knows.

42:18.730 --> 42:20.596
- Will you write to Boris?
- No.

42:21.490 --> 42:23.649
No, I'd be ashamed to.

42:23.650 --> 42:25.449
Ashamed? Why?

42:25.450 --> 42:29.850
I don't know, it would
just feel awkward. False.

42:31.090 --> 42:34.649
That's because you really love
that funny one with the glasses!

42:34.650 --> 42:36.609
Pierre?

42:36.610 --> 42:38.969
I do not!

42:38.970 --> 42:41.650
- Where did you get that from?
- Seeing you dance with him.

42:43.370 --> 42:45.050
What strange ideas you have.

42:48.450 --> 42:50.849
I just can't get used
to the idea of it,

42:50.850 --> 42:52.849
that, suddenly, I own so much.

42:52.850 --> 42:55.129
All these houses, all these estates,

42:55.130 --> 42:58.809
so much land, plantations, forests...

42:58.810 --> 43:01.889
Surely it's wrong that one
man should own so much?

43:01.890 --> 43:05.289
Well, you know, Count Bezukhov,

43:05.290 --> 43:09.009
the saying is that we don't
own our earthly possessions,

43:09.010 --> 43:13.289
we merely curate them for our
heirs, for the generations to come.

43:13.290 --> 43:16.769
Looked at that way, it's
an honour and a duty.

43:16.770 --> 43:18.969
Yes, but I'd like to share this wealth,

43:18.970 --> 43:20.969
not simply hoard it for my children.

43:20.970 --> 43:23.169
I want to change the
way things are run,

43:23.170 --> 43:25.929
not that I've any experience
managing anything,

43:25.930 --> 43:30.329
but I want to do something
useful, something good.

43:30.330 --> 43:32.649
You have a noble heart, Count,

43:32.650 --> 43:35.250
but I'd advise you not
to rush into things.

43:36.410 --> 43:40.370
It'd be my privilege to look after
all those business matters for you.

43:41.850 --> 43:46.050
Your priority now must be to
ensure your own happiness.

43:47.370 --> 43:48.930
How?

43:55.650 --> 43:57.130
(DOOR OPENS)

43:58.410 --> 43:59.530
Oh, it's you.

43:59.555 --> 44:02.489
What a lazy sister I have.

44:02.490 --> 44:04.210
I was out riding at dawn.

44:06.410 --> 44:08.409
Get out, you smell all horsey.

44:08.410 --> 44:11.529
Mmm, what lovely smooth skin.

44:11.530 --> 44:14.050
- Stop that, Anatole.
- You know you love it.

44:15.370 --> 44:18.129
Listen, has Papa spoken to you?

44:18.130 --> 44:20.809
- What about?
- He wants to marry us both off.

44:20.810 --> 44:22.129

little country-mouse sister...

44:25.010 --> 44:27.330
- Oh, she'd suit you perfectly.
- ..and you, darling.....

44:27.355 --> 44:27.776
Who?

44:27.890 --> 44:29.929
- Guess.
- I can't.

44:29.930 --> 44:33.569
What do you say to...

44:33.570 --> 44:35.049
Pierre Bezukhov?

44:35.050 --> 44:36.529
You're joking.

44:36.530 --> 44:38.249
I am...

44:38.250 --> 44:39.849
not.

44:39.850 --> 44:43.009
Oh, he's such a buffoon, Anatole.

44:43.010 --> 44:44.449
Stop doing that!

44:44.450 --> 44:47.530
He's a very wealthy buffoon
and he worships you.

44:49.130 --> 44:52.049
He'd make a very docile,
adoring husband.

44:52.050 --> 44:53.890
Hardly cramp your style at all.

44:55.250 --> 44:57.736
But honestly, Pierre Bezukhov...

44:58.250 --> 45:00.494
Oh, that feels nice, do that again.

45:01.490 --> 45:03.649
You'd better make up your mind to it,

45:03.650 --> 45:06.541
Papa is determined.

45:08.360 --> 45:10.320
It's not a bad situation, you know?

45:11.530 --> 45:16.210
Just think of all those houses,
all that land and all that money.

45:17.610 --> 45:20.369
What a lot of jewels you could buy.

45:20.370 --> 45:23.930
It's all very well for you, you
won't have to sleep with him.

45:27.063 --> 45:28.863
So, you're considering it?

45:30.050 --> 45:32.889
I suppose I shall have to consider it.

45:33.000 --> 45:34.320
Lucky Pierre.

45:38.010 --> 45:40.209
My dear Count Bezukhov,

45:40.210 --> 45:43.889
how very good of you to come
along to my little salon,

45:43.890 --> 45:48.009
when you must still be feeling so
acutely the death of your poor father.

45:48.010 --> 45:50.049
Well, yes, but I hardly knew him.

45:50.050 --> 45:52.249
Mostly, I feel embarrassed
by my good luck

45:52.250 --> 45:55.318
in inheriting such a great fortune,
I've done nothing to deserve it.

45:55.319 --> 45:57.945
Ah, now, Count. There
you are, too modest.

45:57.970 --> 46:00.969
The very fact that your father
singled you out for greatness

46:00.970 --> 46:03.849
shows that you must have
exceptional qualities,

46:03.850 --> 46:06.609
which I discovered for
myself long since.

46:06.610 --> 46:09.169
Really? I had no idea.

46:09.170 --> 46:11.929
And Prince Vassily is advising you?

46:11.930 --> 46:14.329
Yes, yes, he's been very kind.

46:14.330 --> 46:15.889
You couldn't do better.

46:15.890 --> 46:18.689
May I ask, what has been his advice?

46:18.690 --> 46:20.849
Well, he thinks I should get married.

46:20.850 --> 46:24.769
And so you should, a man
in your exalted position.

46:24.770 --> 46:27.049
The Prince is absolutely right!

46:27.050 --> 46:29.369
The trouble is, though,
women don't care for me,

46:29.370 --> 46:30.969
society women, that is,

46:30.970 --> 46:33.529
I don't seem to have the
knack of talking to them.

46:33.530 --> 46:36.049
Believe me, my dear Count,

46:36.050 --> 46:38.809
it is not for you to concern yourself.

46:38.810 --> 46:43.049
It is for the young ladies to make
themselves pleasing to you now,

46:43.050 --> 46:45.569
rather than the other way round,

46:45.570 --> 46:47.330
as you can see for yourself.

46:54.010 --> 46:56.530
I will leave you with
the Princess Helene.

47:00.890 --> 47:03.849
Such a bore, these things, aren't they?

47:03.850 --> 47:06.089
No, not exactly.

47:06.090 --> 47:09.209
I like to listen and talk
about the big things,

47:09.210 --> 47:11.609
politics, ideas, the
war and how to live

47:11.610 --> 47:13.809
and what life really means and so on,

47:13.810 --> 47:16.969
but I always seem to say the
wrong thing and upset people.

47:16.970 --> 47:18.714
You speak from the heart,

47:19.295 --> 47:21.135
of course that frightens people.

47:22.490 --> 47:24.065
Does it frighten you?

47:25.053 --> 47:26.413
Not a bit.

47:27.370 --> 47:28.770
I love it.

47:39.490 --> 47:41.850
Ah, Bolkonsky, there you are.

47:43.170 --> 47:44.503
We're in trouble.

47:45.010 --> 47:49.489
Napoleon's armies have moved so fast
we're in danger of being outflanked.

47:49.490 --> 47:53.449
Prince Bagration has very nobly
volunteered to lead a detachment

47:53.450 --> 47:55.649
and engage the French in battle,

47:55.650 --> 47:58.810
whilst we continue to retreat
with the bulk of the army.

48:00.850 --> 48:02.250
Goodbye, General.

48:03.330 --> 48:05.929
God bless you for a great deed.

48:05.930 --> 48:07.490
I thank you for the honour.

48:11.090 --> 48:12.930
May Christ be with you, dear boy.

48:24.370 --> 48:27.927
Your Grace, I request permission to
join Prince Bagration in this action.

48:28.570 --> 48:31.935
It's 7,000 men against 45,000.

48:33.130 --> 48:37.009
If one quarter of them come
back tomorrow, I'll thank God.

48:37.010 --> 48:39.290
That's why I'm asking to be with them.

48:41.920 --> 48:43.440
Death or glory, eh?

48:45.410 --> 48:46.890
Well, I won't stop you.

We can't hold them, your
Excellency, it's not safe!

49:41.130 --> 49:45.049
Cease fire and reform. We
need the Pavlograd Hussars.

49:45.050 --> 49:46.730
- You, take the message!
- Sir.

50:17.930 --> 50:19.650
It's all right. He's one of ours.

50:21.690 --> 50:23.129

50:23.130 --> 50:24.290
Over here!

(HE MUTTERS)

50:28.737 --> 50:30.372
This is it, boys!

50:32.530 --> 50:34.129
We're needed on the front line.

50:34.130 --> 50:35.929
We need to break through to get there.

50:35.930 --> 50:37.170
Yah!

50:49.810 --> 50:52.290
This is it now. Stay
close, do what I do.

50:59.170 --> 51:01.009
God be with us, boys!

51:01.010 --> 51:02.450
Forward!

51:08.210 --> 51:09.450
Hold it!

51:12.170 --> 51:13.490
There they are.

51:15.010 --> 51:16.370
Hold it!

51:19.930 --> 51:23.890
Here we go! Charge!

51:28.450 --> 51:30.370
Let them have it, lads!

All right, boy, all right.
You'll soon be up again.

52:20.690 --> 52:23.490
Little Rook, what have
they done to you?

52:41.610 --> 52:43.090
Over here!

Please, please!

53:18.450 --> 53:19.929
S'il vous plait, ne me tuez pas!

53:19.930 --> 53:23.449
All right, my little bunny rabbit.
No-one's going to hurt you here.

53:23.450 --> 53:24.809
Where did you come from?

53:24.810 --> 53:28.169
My name is Count Nikolai Ilyich
Rostov of the Pavlograd Hussars.

53:28.170 --> 53:31.089
My horse was shot from under me

53:31.090 --> 53:32.770
and I've hurt my arm.

Tushin!

53:49.930 --> 53:52.369
Pull the guns back, now!

53:52.370 --> 53:53.930
You've done all you can.

53:58.431 --> 54:01.129
This is madness, the guns are lost!
We should get out of this!

54:01.559 --> 54:03.519
You go if you want to, I'm staying.

54:20.585 --> 54:22.764

54:54.770 --> 54:56.330
Just follow what I do.

54:57.450 --> 54:59.649
It's a bit smoother over here.

54:59.650 --> 55:01.370
You'll have to hold me.

55:03.810 --> 55:05.290
Charmant!

55:06.770 --> 55:08.529
It's going well.

Yes, yes.

But he seems unable
to make up his mind.

55:14.170 --> 55:16.130
I may have to force the issue.

What's the matter?

55:33.690 --> 55:35.569
Oh...

55:35.570 --> 55:37.089
you know.

55:37.090 --> 55:38.410
What?

55:41.330 --> 55:43.370
- Come on.
- Oh... Sorry.

55:45.010 --> 55:47.329
It's just, I feel...

55:47.330 --> 55:50.730
All this, what's happened, it's wrong.

55:51.810 --> 55:53.570
It isn't what was meant for me.

55:55.090 --> 55:56.610
That's just silly.

55:59.370 --> 56:00.970
Come on, concentrate.

wanted to say to me?

It's not fair.
