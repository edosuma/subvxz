00:05.939 --> 00:07.694
- (ALAN) Hello.
- (WOMAN) Hello.

00:07.741 --> 00:10.147
- Josh.
- Oh. Hey, Dad.

00:10.277 --> 00:12.316
Here he is. Big man.

00:12.317 --> 00:14.749
Everybody's very dressed up.

00:15.104 --> 00:17.942
Yep. Yeah, it's a
pleasure to see you too.

00:17.948 --> 00:21.286
Oh, my God, yeah, I have been doing
squats, Dad. Thank you for noticing.

00:21.292 --> 00:22.714
How expensive is this place?

00:22.720 --> 00:25.102
Yeah, okay, I'm buying you
and Mum a nice dinner, okay?

00:25.108 --> 00:27.155
You were worried about Mum,
I was worried about Mum,

00:27.161 --> 00:30.244
and I just I thought it'd be nice
if I bought you guys dinner. Mm-hm?

00:30.250 --> 00:31.777
Well, you could've told
me to wear a nice shirt.

00:31.783 --> 00:34.756
Oh, don't be modest. That's...
that is a beautiful shirt.

00:34.757 --> 00:36.178
- Really?
- Mmm.

00:36.184 --> 00:38.292
- I'm not sure about it.
- Mm-hm.

00:38.298 --> 00:40.658
Lock up your daughters,
everyone, 'cause Alan's here.

00:40.664 --> 00:43.867
Alan is here to do things
with your daughters.

00:43.873 --> 00:45.992
- Thank you.
- Sex things.

00:45.998 --> 00:47.797
- Hey, Ma. Hi.
- Hello!

00:47.803 --> 00:49.627
- Ohh. (CHUCKLES)
- Uh?

00:49.633 --> 00:52.806
- How are you, Rose?
- Oh, yes, good. (CHUCKLES)

00:52.812 --> 00:54.759
- Can I take your coat?
- (ROSE) Oh! Yes.

00:55.417 --> 00:57.472
- I'm Josh's mum.
- Perfect.

00:57.478 --> 01:00.073
* One, two. One, two, three, four *

01:00.079 --> 01:01.998
* Ooh *

01:02.004 --> 01:05.183
* Yeah, I'll be fine, yeah, yeah *

01:05.185 --> 01:07.344
- * Ooh *
- * Okay *

01:07.345 --> 01:10.290
- * Ooh, ooh *
- * Oh, the good Lord knows it *

01:10.291 --> 01:12.693
- * Oooh, ooh-ooh *
- * Oh, the good Lord knows it *

01:12.695 --> 01:15.514
- * Ooh *
- * I left better behind *

01:15.520 --> 01:18.739
* I'll be fine, yeah, yeah *

01:18.741 --> 01:21.470
* Make my mamma turn another blind eye *

01:21.472 --> 01:23.676
* Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah *

01:23.677 --> 01:26.226
* I left better behind I'll be fine... *

01:30.277 --> 01:34.397
- Look at this gorgeous plating!
- There is literally 15 dishes coming.

01:34.403 --> 01:36.826
- He didn't ask what we wanted.
- It's a set menu.

01:36.832 --> 01:39.024
Oh, Josh, I've always wanted to eat

01:39.030 --> 01:41.120
- 15 tiny little meals for dinner.
- Mm-hm.

01:41.126 --> 01:42.982
- Thank you!
- Josh, I'm on a diet.

01:42.988 --> 01:44.879
No. You're not on a diet.

01:44.943 --> 01:46.143
Y...

01:47.157 --> 01:49.996
- (WOMAN) Our puffed pig's ear.
- (ALAN) Ohh.

01:49.997 --> 01:53.809
Dad, you made me drink fruit juice every
morning of my entire childhood, okay?

01:53.815 --> 01:55.436
You don't get to diet this evening.

01:55.437 --> 01:58.142
It's too much, Josh. It's too much.

01:58.796 --> 02:00.316
(CRUNCH!)

02:01.717 --> 02:03.681
Oh, bugger me, that's good!

02:03.687 --> 02:05.355
(MAN) I'm sorry to interrupt.

02:05.361 --> 02:07.988
Ah, my name's Dan. I'll be taking
care of the pairings this evening.

02:07.994 --> 02:10.393
Ah, to begin, we're off
to South Gippsland.

02:10.774 --> 02:12.716
- A little blend of Riesling...
- Thanks, Dan.

02:12.717 --> 02:14.796
(DAN) and a touch of
skin-contact Semillon.

02:14.797 --> 02:16.836
- Cheers. Here we go.
- Cheers.

02:16.837 --> 02:18.436
- Eye contact. Eye contact!
- Okay. (CHUCKLES)

02:18.437 --> 02:20.636
This is gonna cost about
200 bucks a head.

02:20.637 --> 02:23.196
Costs the same whether you
complain about it or not, okay?

02:23.197 --> 02:24.957
So let's just stop.

02:25.957 --> 02:28.036
Sorry, I'm just tired.

02:28.037 --> 02:30.476
Why, what's going on in your
little head, little matey?

02:30.477 --> 02:32.236
All I said

02:32.237 --> 02:34.836
was that Grace has been
watching the iPad a lot lately

02:34.837 --> 02:36.996
and somehow Mae's twisted that to mean

02:36.997 --> 02:38.476
I think she's a bad mother.

02:38.477 --> 02:40.436
Well, Grace has been
watching the iPad a lot.

02:40.437 --> 02:42.156
And then she said I had no idea,

02:42.157 --> 02:44.676
and I said something
stupid and stormed out.

02:44.677 --> 02:46.436
Well, what did you say? You have to...

02:46.437 --> 02:47.916
Don't skip that bit now.

02:47.917 --> 02:49.916
I said, "Grace probably
thinks Peppa Pig is her mum."

02:49.917 --> 02:51.557
- (ROSE AND JOSH LAUGH)
- It wasn't funny.

02:52.557 --> 02:54.276
I disagree. I think it's a little funny.

02:54.277 --> 02:55.836
And now she's texting me.

02:55.837 --> 02:58.156
Mmm! My compliments to the chef.

02:58.157 --> 02:59.676
I'll certainly pass those on.

02:59.677 --> 03:01.916
Just text her and tell
her you're sorry, okay?

03:01.917 --> 03:04.396
- And let's move on.
- All right.

03:04.397 --> 03:07.157
Good. Feels better. Mmm.

03:08.157 --> 03:10.596
(DAN) These nests are your golden eggs.

03:10.597 --> 03:12.116
May be eaten shell and all.

03:12.117 --> 03:13.596
Beautiful cured goose ham

03:13.597 --> 03:16.116
with gorgeous flavours of
lavender and cherry blossom.

03:16.117 --> 03:18.236
- Thanks, Dan.
- Thank you.

03:18.237 --> 03:21.276
- Josh, are you meeting any new men?
- Oh, you'll like this.

03:21.277 --> 03:23.916
- I met a podiatrist.
- Mmm! There you go.

03:23.917 --> 03:26.596
- But then he smoked meth.
- Oh, that's not good, Josh.

03:26.597 --> 03:29.116
- (LAUGHS) It's not.
- That is bloody serious, Josh.

03:29.117 --> 03:31.836
- It's not funny.
- (LAUGHS) Yeah.

03:31.837 --> 03:33.556
You must be clever, don't you think?

03:33.557 --> 03:36.436
To be that successful and have
a meth addiction. Impressive.

03:36.437 --> 03:38.436
Please tell me you didn't do it.

03:38.437 --> 03:40.756
- (LAUGHS)
- Is this an intervention?

03:40.757 --> 03:43.436
I didn't organise my own intervention.

03:43.437 --> 03:45.596
It's destroying rural communities.

03:45.597 --> 03:47.237
(LAUGHS)

03:50.237 --> 03:52.396
- Did you or not?
- No. Of course I didn't!

03:52.397 --> 03:55.716
Josh! Could everyone
just behave, please?

03:55.717 --> 03:58.756
- (LAUGHS)
- I just had to make sure.

03:58.757 --> 04:00.676
- Sorry.
- Tasty.

04:00.677 --> 04:02.597
It's delicious.

04:06.797 --> 04:08.836
I don't like you on these apps.

04:08.837 --> 04:11.556
Why? You used to internet date.
What's the difference?

04:11.557 --> 04:14.356
- Mmm! Aged beef is good.
- Oh, that's not the same thing.

04:14.357 --> 04:16.755
Don't think I don't know it's
not the same thing, Josh.

04:16.757 --> 04:18.596
Well, it depends on the app.

04:18.596 --> 04:21.315
You know, on Tinder, you get a
selection of people's photos.

04:21.317 --> 04:23.996
And if you swipe right, it
means that you like them

04:23.997 --> 04:26.196
and if they also swipe right,
Tinder introduces you.

04:26.197 --> 04:28.596
Yes! Correct.

04:28.597 --> 04:30.116
- Oh, it does sound convenient.
- (ALAN) Yeah.

04:30.117 --> 04:32.836
Then you run the risk of having
to bed this bozo. (CHUCKLES)

04:32.837 --> 04:34.756
(ROSE) It must be very vulnerable

04:34.757 --> 04:36.196
putting yourself out
there like that, though.

04:36.197 --> 04:37.876
What choice do I have?

04:37.877 --> 04:39.916
Where am I meeting people?
There's no people.

04:39.917 --> 04:41.396
Do you get rejected a lot?

04:41.397 --> 04:43.396
You learn to focus on the
people that like you,

04:43.397 --> 04:45.876
instead of the people that
don't like you, it's fine.

04:45.877 --> 04:48.676
I don't like you walking around
with all that rejection.

04:48.677 --> 04:50.156
It's really not like that.

04:50.157 --> 04:52.836
I bet the first thing you do
every day when you wake up

04:52.837 --> 04:54.516
is check your phone to see the time

04:54.517 --> 04:56.556
and then you get curious
about those apps

04:56.557 --> 04:58.556
and bam! Before you know
it you've been rejected

04:58.557 --> 05:00.636
before you even get out of bed.

05:00.637 --> 05:02.636
Sometimes I get accepted.

05:02.637 --> 05:06.076
And everyone making snap
judgements based on your photo.

05:06.077 --> 05:09.596
- Mmm.
- Like, you're a sweet guy, Josh.

05:09.597 --> 05:12.756
You know, how do you put
that across in a photo?

05:12.757 --> 05:14.556
Right, because I'd say
the most alluring thing

05:14.557 --> 05:16.156
about you is your sense of humour.

05:16.157 --> 05:18.036
Thanks, Dad.

05:18.037 --> 05:19.516
I don't want to encourage you,

05:19.517 --> 05:22.596
but I have a really lovely photo of you.

05:22.597 --> 05:24.077
Oh, God.

05:25.237 --> 05:27.516
Oh, yeah! No, that is nice.

05:27.517 --> 05:29.516
- It's good. Mmm.
- (ROSE) Yeah. Yeah?

05:29.517 --> 05:32.237
- I'll send a picture message.
- Oh, thanks, Mum.

05:37.557 --> 05:39.477
- What are these?
- (JOSH) It's fish eggs.

05:40.477 --> 05:42.236
Do you miss Arnold?

05:42.237 --> 05:45.156
Um, sometimes I think I
miss him but then I think

05:45.157 --> 05:46.876
maybe I just miss having someone around

05:46.877 --> 05:48.556
to fill the space and make noise.

05:48.557 --> 05:50.236
- Oh, like a wind chime?
- Yeah.

05:50.237 --> 05:51.716
- (SNIGGERS)
- (ALAN) And this?

05:51.717 --> 05:53.757
- (BOTH) It's honeydew.
- (SCOFFS)

05:55.117 --> 05:57.236
So, do you still talk to each other?

05:57.237 --> 05:59.316
Sometimes he messages
me that he misses John.

05:59.317 --> 06:01.597
It's probably code for you.

06:03.837 --> 06:06.556
(WOMAN) Porridge of sunflower
seeds and winter walnuts

06:06.557 --> 06:08.036
enriched with lamb's udder

06:08.037 --> 06:09.636
that's been ageing for 13 months.

06:09.637 --> 06:12.076
And just a touch of mackerel essence.

06:12.077 --> 06:13.756
- Oh, yeah.
- (ALAN) Thank you.

06:13.757 --> 06:15.476
Alan, how's work?

06:15.477 --> 06:17.556
Oh, it's busy, yeah.

06:17.557 --> 06:19.276
No more bullshit involved lately.

06:19.277 --> 06:21.116
Good.

06:21.117 --> 06:23.356
Dad, I think I have a
confession to make.

06:23.357 --> 06:25.196
(ALAN) Yeah?

06:25.197 --> 06:27.596
I don't think I know what you do.

06:27.597 --> 06:30.076
Very funny. (CRUNCHES)

06:30.077 --> 06:31.716
What do you actually do?

06:31.717 --> 06:34.956
How do my son and my ex-wife
not know what my job is?

06:34.957 --> 06:36.956
(JOSH) Maybe you told me when I was 13

06:36.957 --> 06:38.436
and I didn't really understand it,

06:38.437 --> 06:40.276
and as I got older,
it got too embarrassing,

06:40.277 --> 06:43.996
slash, you know, scary to ask you again.

06:43.997 --> 06:46.636
I'm a managerial consultant, Josh.

06:46.637 --> 06:49.556
- Nuh.
- Yeah, goes right over my head.

06:49.557 --> 06:52.476
I was so sure it had something
to do with real estate.

06:52.477 --> 06:55.276
Well, I invest in real estate,
but it isn't my job.

06:55.277 --> 06:56.557
Funny hobby.

06:59.237 --> 07:01.676
(DAN) Next, we have a little
Syrah from McLaren Vale.

07:01.677 --> 07:03.876
Some beautiful black fruits

07:03.877 --> 07:07.276
mixed with black pepper
and some baking spices.

07:07.277 --> 07:10.596
Absolutely stunning with
the very happy duck coming next.

07:10.597 --> 07:12.597
- (ROSE) Thank you, Dan.
- Thanks, Dan.

07:15.117 --> 07:16.756
What are black fruits?

07:16.757 --> 07:18.756
Black fruits are like,
you know, blackberries

07:18.757 --> 07:20.956
or blackcurrants, just dark berries.

07:20.957 --> 07:23.356
And how do they get them into the wine?

07:23.357 --> 07:24.996
(CHUCKLES) No, they don't...

07:24.997 --> 07:26.476
They don't put fruit into the wine.

07:26.477 --> 07:28.876
They don't put the berries
in the wine, Rose.

07:28.877 --> 07:30.436
Have you been thinking all night

07:30.437 --> 07:33.116
that they've been putting
tropical fruit in the wine?

07:33.117 --> 07:34.876
(JOSH) No, okay, so what it is, right,

07:34.877 --> 07:36.836
there just shouldn't
be much else in wine

07:36.837 --> 07:38.316
other than grapes, okay?

07:38.317 --> 07:39.796
The reason why it's interesting

07:39.797 --> 07:42.156
is because, like, the
same variety of grape

07:42.157 --> 07:43.636
grown in different soil
or different weather

07:43.637 --> 07:45.116
would always taste different, right?

07:45.117 --> 07:47.276
They're just words they
use to try and describe

07:47.277 --> 07:48.876
this particular flavour profile.

07:48.877 --> 07:51.516
It's sort of why wine is
so, like, romanticised,

07:51.517 --> 07:54.361
why it can be so expensive,
'cause you can never replicate

07:54.363 --> 07:55.276
what's happening in that bottle.

07:55.277 --> 07:57.356
That's a once off, just that one year.

07:57.357 --> 07:59.436
That make sense?

07:59.437 --> 08:01.436
- Oh, I can smell the berries!
- (JOSH) Yeah?

08:01.437 --> 08:03.356
- Yeah, I can.
- Mmm.

08:03.357 --> 08:04.836
And spices and pepper.

08:04.837 --> 08:06.956
You should be able to
smell oak in there too.

08:06.957 --> 08:08.836
They put the oak in. That's
interesting, isn't it?

08:08.837 --> 08:12.237
- No, I don't smell any oak.
- There's no oak.

08:13.397 --> 08:15.796
There's definitely... there's
just definitely oak.

08:15.797 --> 08:17.276
- Dan?
- Oh, God.

08:17.277 --> 08:20.036
Um, is there oak in this?

08:20.037 --> 08:21.836
No, this one's made entirely in steel,

08:21.837 --> 08:24.796
but it does get a really nice
sense of structure

08:24.797 --> 08:26.436
from the terroir of McLaren Vale.

08:26.437 --> 08:29.316
- Is that a no?
- Abso... No. No oak in this one.

08:29.317 --> 08:31.836
- Thank you, Dan.
- Zero oak.

08:31.837 --> 08:33.916
- Bit of stainless steel.
- All right, all right.

08:33.917 --> 08:36.035
(ALAN CHUCKLES)

08:36.037 --> 08:37.756
Don't embarrass me in front of Dan.

08:37.756 --> 08:40.317
- (LAUGHS)
- I'm working on something here.

08:41.397 --> 08:43.876
(ROSE) Oh, yum!

08:47.997 --> 08:49.917
- Ooh!
- (ALAN) Ha ha.

08:50.917 --> 08:53.516
Hey, do you remember the birds' nests?

08:53.517 --> 08:55.990
- Ohh!
- (BOTH LAUGH)

08:55.991 --> 08:57.996
What? What's going on?

08:57.997 --> 09:01.356
On our honeymoon, on the
island, there were these...

09:01.357 --> 09:03.796
all these holes where the
birds would lay their eggs.

09:03.797 --> 09:06.396
(LAUGHS) They... they should
have warned us in the brochure.

09:06.397 --> 09:08.116
(LAUGHS) Your dad...

09:08.117 --> 09:10.316
Every time we tried to go for a walk,

09:10.317 --> 09:12.956
your poor dad would just
trip in one of the holes.

09:12.957 --> 09:15.676
So furious. You can imagine.

09:15.677 --> 09:16.916
"F..." (LAUGHS)

09:16.917 --> 09:18.676
- "Fucking mu..."
- "Fucking mutton-birds!"

09:18.677 --> 09:20.676
And then he's up at reception,

09:20.677 --> 09:22.356
"Someone should fill in
those bloody holes!"

09:22.357 --> 09:23.836
They should've filled them in.

09:23.837 --> 09:25.236
It was a health-and-safety hazard.

09:25.237 --> 09:26.716
Health-and-safety hazard. (LAUGHS)

09:26.717 --> 09:28.356
"Should've been in the brochure."

09:28.357 --> 09:30.596
(BOTH LAUGH)

09:30.597 --> 09:32.836
I feel like every time you
talk about the best parts

09:32.837 --> 09:34.956
of your relationship, it's
always before I was born.

09:34.957 --> 09:36.956
Oh, yeah, absolutely.
No doubt about that.

09:36.957 --> 09:39.196
Josh was definitely the worst
part of the relationship.

09:39.197 --> 09:41.196
- (ROSE) No!
- All right, okay.

09:41.197 --> 09:43.437
- (ALAN LAUGHS)
- Josh wasn't the worst part.

09:44.997 --> 09:46.796
The affairs were the worst part.

09:46.797 --> 09:48.876
(JOSH) Ooh-ah.

09:48.877 --> 09:50.716
- (ROSE) What? No, it's fine.
- I don't...

09:50.717 --> 09:53.356
I'm just saying, the reason
we broke up were the affairs.

09:53.357 --> 09:54.916
Other than that, he's all right.

09:54.917 --> 09:57.276
I think there were a number of
reasons for the separation.

09:57.277 --> 09:59.677
Oh, yeah, you had reasons,
I was a nightmare.

10:00.717 --> 10:03.317
But, you know, the affairs,
I couldn't look past them.

10:04.357 --> 10:07.076
But you're not too bad.

10:07.077 --> 10:08.916
Have you seen his emu impression?

10:08.917 --> 10:11.676
Yep. Yeah, we've all seen the
emu impression, haven't we?

10:11.677 --> 10:13.836
- Oh, he's doing it now.
- (ROSE LAUGHS) Oh, no.

10:13.837 --> 10:15.517
- (JOSH) Great.
- (ROSE CONTINUES LAUGHING)

10:18.997 --> 10:20.957
- (CHUCKLES)
- (ROSE) Alan... (LAUGHS)

10:22.397 --> 10:25.597
Alan, sit down! (LAUGHS)

10:26.917 --> 10:28.396
- Sorry, Dan.
- (ALAN) Sorry, Dan.

10:28.397 --> 10:30.556
(ROSE LAUGHS)

10:30.557 --> 10:32.157
Sorry, sorry.

10:33.797 --> 10:36.196
Actually, I'm surprised you
weren't bullied at school.

10:36.197 --> 10:37.956
- Jesus fucking Christ.
- Ooh.

10:37.957 --> 10:39.436
Of course I was bullied at school.

10:39.437 --> 10:40.876
What are you talking about?

10:40.877 --> 10:44.156
- No, you weren't. Were you?
- How do you not know this?

10:44.157 --> 10:46.516
Well, you never told us.
Did he tell you?

10:46.517 --> 10:48.516
- I had a feeling.
- I didn't need to tell you.

10:48.517 --> 10:49.996
You saw me in school musicals.

10:49.997 --> 10:51.796
Just 'cause you're in school
musicals doesn't mean anything.

10:51.797 --> 10:53.236
It means I was bullied.

10:53.237 --> 10:55.876
I did worry when you went
to school in red tights.

10:55.877 --> 10:57.676
Yeah, why would you let me do that?

10:57.677 --> 11:00.076
I told you not to dress as a fairy.

11:00.077 --> 11:03.116
I was Cupid, obviously, okay? I
mean, I had heart-shaped arrows.

11:03.117 --> 11:06.116
- Well, what were we supposed to do?
- Anything.

11:06.117 --> 11:08.756
Not driving me to school in
red tights seems easy enough.

11:08.757 --> 11:10.796
Oh, it was just so often, lovey.

11:10.797 --> 11:12.396
It was the ritual theatre.

11:12.397 --> 11:14.462
- The purple hair. The cheerleading.
- Okay.

11:14.463 --> 11:16.311
- The performing arts prefect.
- Mm-hm.

11:16.312 --> 11:18.356
- The accordion. The...
- Yep. All right.

11:18.357 --> 11:19.836
You had those full-body bathers.

11:19.837 --> 11:22.316
Anyway, we were all bullied
at school a bit, weren't we?

11:22.317 --> 11:24.036
- Were we? Were you?
- Oh, yeah.

11:24.037 --> 11:25.716
You were... Who bullied you?

11:25.717 --> 11:27.956
Nick Wasserman was
constantly harassing me.

11:27.957 --> 11:29.996
- How?
- Always calling me stupid names.

11:29.997 --> 11:31.636
- What did he call you?
- Peaches.

11:31.637 --> 11:33.116
- Peaches?
- Peaches?

11:33.117 --> 11:35.556
On the bus, across the oval.
Always Peaches.

11:35.557 --> 11:38.476
I mean, that's not so bad,
is it? Peaches. Delicious!

11:38.477 --> 11:40.476
Ah, excuse me, my name is Alan.

11:40.477 --> 11:42.276
What did you call him? Just Nick?

11:42.277 --> 11:44.596
- Yeah.
- Not Big Boy? Sugar Lips?

11:44.597 --> 11:47.156
- Nectarine? Nala?
- No.

11:47.157 --> 11:50.410
Did he do anything else to you
apart from calling you Peaches?

11:50.412 --> 11:52.891
Sometimes he'd turn up
at my house unannounced.

11:52.893 --> 11:54.892
So your bully in school
was a guy who gave you

11:54.893 --> 11:57.532
a delightful nickname and then
sometimes wanted to hang out.

11:57.533 --> 11:59.732
I don't think that boy
was a bully, Peaches.

11:59.733 --> 12:01.652
I think he was in love with you.

12:01.653 --> 12:03.253
- (LAUGHS)
- Ohh!

12:04.533 --> 12:06.372
Why are you so desperate
to have been bullied?

12:06.373 --> 12:07.852
It's okay to have not been bullied.

12:07.853 --> 12:09.852
- Mae bullies me.
- (MUMBLES) No, she doesn't.

12:09.853 --> 12:11.772
- Oh, Mae's not a bully.
- Okay, she's not.

12:11.773 --> 12:13.852
I just wanted to say that.
I don't know why.

12:13.853 --> 12:15.532
Are you two all right?

12:15.533 --> 12:17.892
Oh, yeah, we're... we're
working through things.

12:17.893 --> 12:19.372
No, it's good, it's good.

12:19.373 --> 12:20.852
So you think you'll stay together?

12:20.853 --> 12:23.132
- Yeah, yeah.
- Yes, you're staying together.

12:23.133 --> 12:26.772
- Dad, you're staying together.
- No, don't say that, Joshua.

12:26.773 --> 12:28.972
Sometimes it's best to
know when things are over

12:28.973 --> 12:30.452
and if they were to separate

12:30.453 --> 12:32.572
it's better to do it
when Grace is young.

12:32.573 --> 12:33.418
Shut up.

12:33.426 --> 12:37.826
* Wah, wah, wah. Wah, wah, wah *

Oh, fuck.

12:48.053 --> 12:51.172
Ohh! Fuck off.

12:51.173 --> 12:52.972
Oh, God, that's fucked in the head.

12:52.973 --> 12:56.252
That's like North Korea but in a lychee.

12:56.253 --> 12:58.452
It's like blood diamonds, you know?

12:58.453 --> 12:59.932
Mmm!

12:59.933 --> 13:02.332
I'm going to list some other
bad things now. Okay.

13:02.333 --> 13:05.733
Um... income inequality.

13:07.533 --> 13:09.092
Diabetes.

13:09.093 --> 13:12.292
Cats. Cat people.

13:12.293 --> 13:15.372
What about getting a
pimple in your nostril?

13:15.373 --> 13:18.172
- Murder.
- And speed cameras.

13:18.173 --> 13:19.652
Murdering lots of people.

13:19.653 --> 13:23.452
Or when, um, orcas are in captivity.

13:23.453 --> 13:26.972
Vegans but not all the vegans,
just quite a lot of them.

13:26.973 --> 13:28.852
I haven't got one.

13:28.853 --> 13:31.412
- Umm...
- Oh, Josh, um...

13:31.413 --> 13:34.532
Ohh! I had something to tell
you but I can't remember.

13:34.533 --> 13:36.572
I'm not done listing bad things.

13:36.573 --> 13:38.132
- Hitler!
- Whoa, and we're done.

13:38.133 --> 13:39.612
Yeah, you can't beat Hitler.

13:39.613 --> 13:41.212
Oh, I remember.

13:41.213 --> 13:42.772
- (CHUCKLES)
- What? What is it?

13:42.773 --> 13:44.252
Okay, I just wanted to remind you

13:44.253 --> 13:46.012
that, um... you're shit at sports.

13:46.013 --> 13:48.213
- (LAUGHS)
- Brilliant. Funny.

13:50.733 --> 13:52.652
Josh, have you heard from Hannah?

13:52.653 --> 13:54.292
Yeah, we've been texting.

13:54.293 --> 13:56.732
- How is she?
- Mmm. She's getting bees.

13:56.733 --> 13:58.212
I suppose those bees

13:58.213 --> 14:00.092
will be easier to live with than me.

14:00.093 --> 14:02.692
I couldn't live with Hannah,
terrifying woman.

14:02.693 --> 14:04.172
Just text her, okay?

14:04.173 --> 14:06.252
She's got room in her
social calendar for you.

14:06.253 --> 14:09.172
No, I'm too scared to see what she says.

14:09.173 --> 14:11.572
Do you want to send her
a little video message?

14:11.573 --> 14:14.693
- Hey? That could be cute.
- I know how to do a face swap.

14:16.453 --> 14:17.933

- I'm already filming.

14:31.093 --> 14:33.173
- Um, no, can we start again, Josh?
- Nah.

14:34.173 --> 14:35.892
No, Josh, I really want to start again.

14:35.893 --> 14:38.092
- I'll edit it.
- No, I don't...

14:38.093 --> 14:40.252
What am I going to say?

14:40.253 --> 14:41.732
What do you want to say?

14:41.733 --> 14:43.372
I'm sorry for being shit.

14:43.373 --> 14:45.532
Well, then say that.

14:47.973 --> 14:50.572

14:50.573 --> 14:52.613
I hope you're well.

14:53.693 --> 14:56.772
And, uh, put some papaya on your eye.

14:56.773 --> 14:59.132
Brilliant. Good.

14:59.133 --> 15:01.572
Beautiful performance.

15:01.573 --> 15:03.052
You didn't edit that, did you?

15:03.053 --> 15:05.213
No. No. (CHUCKLES)

15:09.373 --> 15:12.052
Have you found someone
to rent Tom's room yet?

15:12.053 --> 15:13.972
Oh, God, they're so far from moving out.

15:13.973 --> 15:15.532
They're not good at doing "things".

15:15.533 --> 15:17.012
You'd better bloody get onto it.

15:17.013 --> 15:18.732
Yes, it's just that Tom's still in it.

15:18.733 --> 15:20.372
Who do you think will be moving in?

15:20.373 --> 15:21.892
I don't know.

15:21.893 --> 15:23.772
Okay, just make sure you interview them

15:23.773 --> 15:25.332
before you give them the room.

15:25.333 --> 15:26.812
- I know, Dad.
- (ALAN) Girls are neat.

15:26.813 --> 15:28.292
- Are they?
- No, they're not.

15:28.293 --> 15:30.172
Make sure they sign the lease

15:30.173 --> 15:33.092
and make sure they direct
debit the rent, no excuses.

15:33.093 --> 15:34.812
Yes! Dad, I know all this.

15:34.813 --> 15:37.972
Why do you think I don't know
all this, okay? I know, yeah?

15:37.973 --> 15:39.812
Why do you always have
to pre-empt my mistakes?

15:39.813 --> 15:41.332
Can't I do the thing

15:41.333 --> 15:43.212
and if something goes
wrong, I'll deal with it?

15:43.213 --> 15:44.692

15:44.693 --> 15:46.492

annoying thing happens.

I think you need to
calm down a bit, Josh.

15:48.893 --> 15:51.212
Well, it's just never ending.
It's just always.

15:51.213 --> 15:52.692
Insufferable.

15:52.693 --> 15:54.172
Well, I have to pre-empt your mistakes

15:54.173 --> 15:56.852
because I'm the one who pays
when it all goes tits up!

15:56.853 --> 15:58.932
Actually just not true, okay?

15:58.933 --> 16:00.412
I haven't asked for your help lately.

16:02.093 --> 16:03.772

Well, I do because I'm
the bloody landlord!

16:14.053 --> 16:15.572

16:17.293 --> 16:19.292

Now, putting aside when you're
a bit of a brat with your dad,

16:22.813 --> 16:24.412
you're a great person, Josh.

16:24.413 --> 16:26.212

16:26.213 --> 16:28.492
No, you are.

16:28.493 --> 16:32.612
Now, I don't know if we just got lucky

16:32.613 --> 16:36.412
or if I owe your dad and Aunty Peg

16:36.413 --> 16:38.533
more credit than I ever gave them.

16:39.693 --> 16:41.893
It definitely wasn't my doing.

(CHOKINGLY) You are a
very special young man.

16:50.773 --> 16:53.572
And I just want to let you know
how thankful I am for that.

16:53.573 --> 16:55.412

16:55.413 --> 16:57.453

17:01.213 --> 17:04.252
Okay. That was a lot.

17:04.252 --> 17:06.692
Well, no, I don't care.

17:06.693 --> 17:10.053
That's what you get for
treating us just this nicely.

17:11.492 --> 17:14.613
Okay, Dad, tell me everything you
want to tell me about the house.

17:17.053 --> 17:18.531
I was just going to say

17:18.532 --> 17:20.452
that when you find someone to move in,

17:20.453 --> 17:22.771
ask them if they have a partner,

17:22.772 --> 17:25.172
otherwise you'll be copping
two for the price of one

17:25.173 --> 17:26.892
and they'll be paying half price.

17:26.893 --> 17:28.733
I'm going to the toilet.

17:34.133 --> 17:35.972
I have something to tell you.

17:35.973 --> 17:37.972
Oh, you've already said quite a lot.

17:37.973 --> 17:40.572
- I'm still in love with your dad.
- No, you're not.

17:40.573 --> 17:42.252
- (ROSE) Yes, I am.
- You are not.

17:42.253 --> 17:43.072
- Yes, I am.
- Are not.

17:43.074 --> 17:45.440
- I'm still in love with him.
- Actually you're not.

17:45.442 --> 17:47.372
- (ROSE) I am.
- Why are you saying this?

17:47.373 --> 17:49.092
Because it's a thing you tell people

17:49.093 --> 17:51.172
and I don't have that
many people I can tell.

17:51.173 --> 17:53.332
Well, you aren't telling Dad.
Absolutely not.

17:53.333 --> 17:54.932
Mmm...

17:54.933 --> 17:58.412
No. Mum, ab-so-lute-ly not.

17:58.413 --> 18:01.492
No, I won't, all right? I won't.
Stop looking so scared.

18:01.493 --> 18:02.972
Oh, I mean, how?

18:02.973 --> 18:03.852
He's a fully grown adult

18:03.853 --> 18:05.932
and he's completely befuddled
that things happen.

18:05.933 --> 18:08.452
He's just shocked that
things in life occur.

18:08.453 --> 18:10.252
Oh, I'm not longing for him.

18:10.253 --> 18:12.612
I mean, I don't want anything to change.

18:12.613 --> 18:15.492
It's just a nice feeling
to feel love for someone

18:15.493 --> 18:17.172
and I don't feel it very often

18:17.173 --> 18:21.572
and, look, I actually
remember why I loved him.

18:21.573 --> 18:25.732
And I feel it and you gave me wine,

18:25.733 --> 18:30.029
and I am indulging in
my love for your dad.

18:30.030 --> 18:32.289
It's very gross. It is gross.

18:32.653 --> 18:34.693
Ooh! So sorry. Sorry.

18:38.333 --> 18:39.892
God, they're flash bathrooms.

18:39.893 --> 18:42.692
They've got mirrors on
every side of the cubicle.

18:42.693 --> 18:45.413
I felt like I was pissing
into infinity. (LAUGHS)

18:47.293 --> 18:48.772
You're looking very slim, Rose.

18:48.773 --> 18:51.132
- (JOSH) No, she's not.
- (ALAN) I'm sorry?

18:51.133 --> 18:53.292
Sorry, I mean, yeah, okay.
Yep, you look good.

18:53.293 --> 18:55.612
He's just jealous of the compliment.

18:55.613 --> 18:57.612
Oh, you're looking slim too...

18:57.613 --> 18:59.012
- Thanks, Dad.
- Josh.

18:59.013 --> 19:01.332
- You should see the toilets.
- No, I don't need to.

19:01.333 --> 19:03.932
It doesn't matter. But you've
never seen anything like them.

19:03.933 --> 19:06.172
- Honestly, go on!
- I don't need to go!

19:06.173 --> 19:08.132
All right, all right.

19:08.133 --> 19:11.132
So back when you were
five or six, a rainy day,

19:11.133 --> 19:13.852
your mum set you up on the kitchen bench

19:13.853 --> 19:16.652
and said, "Let's bake a cake."

19:16.653 --> 19:20.372
So we began with a little
flour and some butter,

19:20.373 --> 19:21.932
a touch of baking powder,

19:21.933 --> 19:23.777
beautiful flavours of vanilla,

19:23.779 --> 19:27.572
some star anise and pistachios,

19:27.573 --> 19:29.612
a little nutmeg, touch of cinnamon...

19:29.613 --> 19:32.212
(ROSE) Oh, this is wild! Ohh!

19:32.213 --> 19:35.013
Of course, some milk.

19:36.373 --> 19:37.852
Ohh! (GIGGLES)

19:37.853 --> 19:40.292
And to finish, a few eggs.

19:40.293 --> 19:43.172
Oh! (LAUGHS)

19:43.173 --> 19:45.332
(LAUGHS)

19:45.333 --> 19:47.652
- Thank you.
- Ohh.

19:47.653 --> 19:49.253
- Wow. Wow.
- Ohh!

19:51.253 --> 19:52.732
- Mmm!
- (ALL CRUNCH NUTS)

19:52.733 --> 19:54.572
- Mmm!
- Mmm!

19:54.573 --> 19:57.333
Mmm! Mmm! Mmm! Mmm.

19:58.333 --> 19:59.812
Oh! Mmm!

19:59.813 --> 20:03.932
- Mmmm... Yeah.
- Mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm.

20:03.933 --> 20:06.933
(QUIRKY PIANO MUSIC)

20:24.493 --> 20:27.652
It seems like your mum's in a
really good place, doesn't it?

20:27.653 --> 20:30.853
- Yeah, yeah, she seems good.
- Yeah.

20:31.555 --> 20:34.532
I don't think I've seen
her this happy for years.

20:34.533 --> 20:36.012
She looks healthy too.

20:36.013 --> 20:37.652
Yep, yeah, very healthy.

20:37.653 --> 20:39.572
Josh, do you... do you think

20:39.573 --> 20:42.012
maybe you could say
something nice to your mum?

20:42.013 --> 20:44.572
What do you mean? I took
her to a 15-course meal.

20:44.573 --> 20:46.612
Yeah, no, I know. Yeah, it's nice.

20:46.613 --> 20:49.012
But, you know, I just think
it would really make her day

20:49.013 --> 20:51.692
and maybe keep her in this
mood if you could just,

20:51.693 --> 20:54.453
you know, go out on a limb and
say something from the heart.

20:56.753 --> 21:00.352
There are real towels in the bathroom.

21:00.354 --> 21:01.839
Real, not paper.

21:01.840 --> 21:03.732
I used two just because.

21:03.733 --> 21:05.133
(CHUCKLES) Right.

21:09.253 --> 21:11.652
Can I get you anything else?
A tea or coffee?

21:11.653 --> 21:13.572
- Oh, God, no.
- Ah, no, thank you, Ellie.

21:13.573 --> 21:15.412
- I don't have any room left.
- No, me neither.

21:15.413 --> 21:17.012
Would you like me to organise the bill?

21:17.013 --> 21:19.212
- Yeah, thank you.
- (DRUMS ON TABLETOP)

21:19.213 --> 21:22.932
Um, Rose, Josh was just saying

21:22.933 --> 21:24.892
some really nice things about you

21:24.893 --> 21:26.492
while you were in the bathroom.

21:26.493 --> 21:28.413
Weren't you, Josh?

21:29.613 --> 21:31.372
Yep.

21:31.373 --> 21:34.452
Okay, so, Mum, I've never
said that really...

21:34.453 --> 21:37.012
that many genuine things
about you, I guess,

21:37.013 --> 21:39.412
and that's because I tend
to think nice things unsaid

21:39.413 --> 21:40.892
are usually the best things.

21:40.893 --> 21:44.652
But I can see by the face
that you're making right now

21:44.653 --> 21:47.332
that you would much prefer
it if they were not unsaid.

21:47.333 --> 21:49.732
- (ALAN CHUCKLES)
- (JOSH) So...

21:49.733 --> 21:53.893
Um, just, um, thank you
for keeping me alive.

21:55.333 --> 21:56.852
That would have been hard, right?

21:56.853 --> 21:58.812
That would have been a hard thing.

21:58.813 --> 22:02.052
Secondly, ah... you're a fun person.

22:02.053 --> 22:04.252
Yeah, I feel like maybe
you don't know that,

22:04.253 --> 22:06.772
but the decisions you make,
they're genuinely entertaining,

22:06.773 --> 22:08.252
especially when they're terrible

22:08.253 --> 22:09.732
and that has always been

22:09.733 --> 22:11.532
the only prerequisite
I have for a friend.

22:11.533 --> 22:12.747
Aww.

22:15.733 --> 22:18.772
Also, um, you're a good person

22:18.773 --> 22:21.573
and I love you.

22:24.853 --> 22:27.052
- When you're ready.
- Whoa, Dad.

22:27.053 --> 22:28.732
(CHUCKLES)

22:28.733 --> 22:30.452
- What are you doing?
- No, I'm paying.

22:30.453 --> 22:32.372
Uh-uh, I just want to have a look.

22:32.373 --> 22:35.012
- No... no.
- Josh, you're being silly.

22:35.013 --> 22:37.212
- Come on.
- No, please just give it to me.

22:37.213 --> 22:40.292
- Please just let me have it.
- (GASPS)

22:40.293 --> 22:42.652
- $900?
- What?!

22:42.653 --> 22:45.572
- $900?
- Yeah.

22:45.573 --> 22:47.172
Dad, I haven't bought
you a Christmas present

22:47.173 --> 22:48.652
for, like, 25 years.

22:48.653 --> 22:50.132
I can't believe this, Josh.

22:50.133 --> 22:52.292
This is exactly what I was
talking about before!

22:52.293 --> 22:53.972
Don't worry about it because I'm paying.

22:53.973 --> 22:56.452
- You can't afford that.
- Yes, I can.

22:56.453 --> 22:58.412
- How?
- I'll put it on my credit card.

22:58.413 --> 23:00.572
Oh, get fucked, you don't
have a credit card.

23:00.573 --> 23:01.510
- I get points.
- Do you?

23:01.511 --> 23:02.868
I'm paying!

23:02.933 --> 23:04.452
- No...
- No, you are not!

23:04.453 --> 23:06.893
No, already have. You let me.
You let me.

23:08.053 --> 23:10.692
- She can't afford this.
- Ohh! (LAUGHS)

23:10.693 --> 23:16.012
This is the best $900 I have
ever spent in my whole life!

23:16.013 --> 23:17.492
Are you kidding?

23:17.493 --> 23:19.093
- Thanks, Mum.
- (CHUCKLES)

23:20.173 --> 23:23.372
(ALAN) Oh, boy, oh, boy, I've...
I've had too much to drink.

23:23.373 --> 23:26.052
I can not drive home, so I'll
probably get a parking ticket.

23:26.053 --> 23:28.412
On top of everything else.
Book me an Uber.

23:28.413 --> 23:30.412
How will I get home
if you're on my Uber?

23:30.413 --> 23:32.212
- Book two.
- You can't book two Ubers.

23:32.213 --> 23:34.852
- Just get a taxi.
- (HANNAH) Nuh, get stuffed.

23:34.853 --> 23:38.012
Next time you send a
video, get some skin out.

23:38.013 --> 23:40.812
I was waiting for a text
to confirm my pizza.

23:40.813 --> 23:42.652
- Call me tomorrow.
- (ALAN) won't book me a car?

23:42.653 --> 23:44.812
I thought people your age
preferred getting taxis.

23:44.813 --> 23:46.932
What the hell's that supposed to mean?

23:46.933 --> 23:49.252
Oh, I love you, darling.

23:49.253 --> 23:50.732
Okay, thanks, Ma. Thanks so much.

23:50.733 --> 23:52.652
Oh, thank you for an incredible night.

23:52.653 --> 23:54.533
Thank yourself.

23:57.213 --> 23:58.852
I love you too, Alan.

23:58.853 --> 24:02.692
I am so glad I got a chance to
clean up the mess for a change.

24:02.693 --> 24:04.172
It was not a mess.

24:04.173 --> 24:06.132
Ah, Rose, do you need a lift home?

24:06.133 --> 24:08.532
Ah, no. No, I'm going to
catch the last train.

24:08.533 --> 24:10.493
- 'Bye.
- See ya.

24:20.493 --> 24:22.212
She probably shouldn't
kiss me like that.

24:22.213 --> 24:24.893
Yeah. Right?
