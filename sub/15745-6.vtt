WEBVTT

00:18.200 --> 00:20.100
I KNOW THOSE FOOTPRINTS.

00:20.170 --> 00:22.270
THEY BELONG
TO THE SAGITTARIUS STOMPER.

00:22.340 --> 00:23.470
- STOMPER!
- GRR!

00:23.540 --> 00:25.540
COME OUT
WITH YOUR HANDS--AAH!

00:27.180 --> 00:28.410
CALL THE LOONATICS!

00:28.480 --> 00:30.080
WE CAN'T LET HIM
GET TO THE TOP,

00:30.150 --> 00:32.280
OR IT'LL BE
RAINING CHAOS!

00:33.750 --> 00:35.250
HEH HEH HEH!

00:47.600 --> 00:49.600
HE COULD GET HURT
UP THERE.

00:49.670 --> 00:50.830
SAGITTARIUS STOMPER,

00:50.900 --> 00:52.740
GET DOWN HERE,
OR WE'RE COMING UP!

00:52.800 --> 00:55.070
THAT'S RIGHT! UNH!

00:59.380 --> 01:01.040
I TAKE THAT AS A "NO?"

01:03.710 --> 01:04.980
I'LL BRING HIM DOWN.

01:05.050 --> 01:08.520
BEHOLD THE ATOMIC PHASE
DEPARTICULATORS.

01:08.590 --> 01:09.790
A.P.D. FOR SHORT.

01:09.850 --> 01:10.990
SO, WHAT IS IT,

01:11.050 --> 01:12.990
ASIDE FROM BEING
UNPRONOUNCABA

01:13.060 --> 01:15.130
IT CAN PHASE SHIFT
SOLID TO LIQUID,

01:15.190 --> 01:16.730
AND LIQUID TO GAS.

01:16.790 --> 01:18.960
SO CAN SLAM WHEN
HE EATS TOO MANY BEANS.

01:19.960 --> 01:21.500
OOPSIE!

01:21.570 --> 01:23.100
I THINK THE IDEA
IS TO CHANGE THE BUILDING

01:23.170 --> 01:24.930
BENEATH THE STOMPER'S HANDS
FROM SOLID BRICK TO LIQUID.

01:25.000 --> 01:26.040
WITH NOTHING TO HOLD ONTO,
BOOM!

01:26.100 --> 01:28.370
HE FALLS RIGHT INTO
OUR HANDS.

01:28.440 --> 01:32.240
OLLIE OLLIE OXEN FREE!

01:34.140 --> 01:35.580
LOOK OUT!

01:35.650 --> 01:38.150
STOMPER'S ABOUT TO DROP
SOMETHING ELSE!

01:38.220 --> 01:40.850
I'M TOO HANDSOME
TO BE OXEN FREE!

01:42.720 --> 01:45.190
- NO!
- WHOA-HO-HO!

01:49.630 --> 01:51.630
MY MACHINE!

01:56.730 --> 01:58.370
WHOA!

02:02.840 --> 02:06.680
AT LAST!
I'M FREE!

02:09.950 --> 02:13.480
UH, DON'T WORRY.
EVERYTHING'S UNDER CONTROL.

02:13.550 --> 02:14.250
AAH!

02:14.320 --> 02:15.690
AH HA HA HA HA!

02:15.750 --> 02:17.850
AH HEE HEE HEE HA!

02:22.790 --> 02:23.730
HUH?

02:23.790 --> 02:26.000
AAH!

02:26.060 --> 02:28.500
AAH! OOF!

02:28.570 --> 02:29.900
YOU FIRST.

02:29.970 --> 02:31.270
NO, YOU!

02:33.640 --> 02:34.570
NO, YOU!

02:34.640 --> 02:36.910
GRR! AAH!

02:36.970 --> 02:39.280
OOF! UHH!

02:39.340 --> 02:40.880
HOLD THE PRESSES!
WHAT A SCOOP!

02:40.940 --> 02:42.380
DANGER DUCK
CAPTURES STOMPER!

02:42.450 --> 02:43.780
WHAT A HERO!

02:43.850 --> 02:44.780
DUCK?

02:44.850 --> 02:46.950
BUT--BUT--BUT--BUT I--

02:47.020 --> 02:48.050
OH, DEAR.

02:48.120 --> 02:49.950
AND HE'S SUCH
A GOOD BOY, REALLY.

02:50.020 --> 02:54.390
WHY, HE NEVER MADE A PEEP
AFTER...THE ACCIDENT.

02:54.460 --> 02:56.630
HERE, LET ME SHOW YOU
HIS BABY PICTURES!

02:56.690 --> 02:59.300
HA HA!
HERE'S MY WITTLE STOMPER

02:59.360 --> 03:01.670
AFTER THE OPERATION.

03:01.730 --> 03:04.270
CUTE AS A BUTTON!

03:04.330 --> 03:06.400
OK, STOMPER, TIME TO GO
TO THE SLAMMER.

03:06.470 --> 03:08.100
I'LL BE BACK.

03:08.170 --> 03:09.110
AND WHEN I DO,

03:09.170 --> 03:10.170
I'M GONNA...

03:10.240 --> 03:14.810
GET THE DUCK!

03:19.550 --> 03:20.580
* ROCKETS OUT! *

03:20.650 --> 03:22.550
* LOONATICS BUST OUT *

03:22.620 --> 03:25.190
* REV, LEXI, AND TECH *

03:25.260 --> 03:27.090
* SLAM, AND DUCK *

03:27.160 --> 03:29.630
WORK IT!

03:29.690 --> 03:32.760
* ACE IS COOL
AND LEADS THE PACK *

03:32.830 --> 03:35.230
* ACE'S SWORD
DRIVES 'EM BACK *

03:37.470 --> 03:38.870
* WHEN BIG, BAD BOTS
SMACK DOWN JACK *

03:38.940 --> 03:40.770
* LEXI'S BRAIN BLAST
MAKES 'EM CRACK *

03:40.840 --> 03:42.710
* QUACKIN' IN,
QUACKIN' OUT *

03:42.770 --> 03:44.610
* DUCK WILL MAKE
THEM TRAITORS SHOUT *

03:44.670 --> 03:46.740
* ACTIVATE, REGENERATE *

03:46.810 --> 03:48.480
* MAGNETIC POWERS
LEVITATE *

03:48.550 --> 03:50.950
* READY, SET, LET'S JET *

03:54.120 --> 03:56.320
BAM, SLAM!

03:56.390 --> 03:59.120
* UH, TORNADO ZING
WHEN HE MODELS *

03:59.190 --> 04:00.590
* IT'S SET, LET'S JET! *

04:00.660 --> 04:02.960
* SUPERSONIC REV
HEATS 'EM UP *

04:03.030 --> 04:04.330
* AT THE SPEED OF LIGHT *

04:04.390 --> 04:05.960
* IT'S SET, LET'S JET! *

04:08.700 --> 04:10.400
WORK IT!

04:10.470 --> 04:12.340
* SET! LET'S JET! *

04:14.640 --> 04:16.810
* WHOO! POWER

04:16.870 --> 04:18.740

LOTS OF NERVE *

04:18.810 --> 04:20.610

NEVER SWERVE *

04:20.680 --> 04:22.750
* LOONATICS UNLEASHED! *

04:27.450 --> 04:29.190
SO, HOW DID IT FEEL
TO TAKE DOWN THE STOMPER

04:29.250 --> 04:30.320
ALL BY YOURSELF?

04:30.390 --> 04:31.760
DID YOU EVER DOUBT
YOUR CHANCES?

04:31.820 --> 04:33.790
UM, WHAT KIND OF
BREAKFAST CEREAL DO YOU EAT?

04:33.860 --> 04:34.860
GREAT. NO.

04:34.920 --> 04:37.260
ANYTHING WITH MY PICTURE
ON THE BOX.

04:37.330 --> 04:39.100
HA HA HA!

04:39.160 --> 04:41.000
GEE, AND I THOUGHT HE WAS
TOUGH TO LIVE WITH BEFORE.

04:41.060 --> 04:44.100
EH, HE'S JUST ENJOYING
HIS 15 MINUTES OF GLORY.

04:44.170 --> 04:45.640
MY 15 MINUTES!

04:45.700 --> 04:48.070
IT WAS MY INVENTION
THAT SAVED THE DAY.

04:48.140 --> 04:50.810
DID I EVER TELL YOU
THAT DANGER IS MY MIDDLE NAME?

04:50.870 --> 04:52.610
- HEY!
- ACTUALLY, DANGER
IS ALSO HIS FIRST NAME,

04:52.680 --> 04:54.110
BUT I HEARD HE WAS THINKING OF
CHANGING HIS LAST NAME

04:54.180 --> 04:55.810
TO DANGER, MAKING HIM
DANGER DANGER DANGER.

04:55.880 --> 04:57.580
BUT THEN WHEN YOU CALLED HIM,
HE'D NEVER KNOW IF YOU WERE

04:57.650 --> 04:58.520
CALLING HIM BY HIS FIRST NAME,
MIDDLE NAME, LAST NAME--

04:58.580 --> 04:59.480
HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY!

04:59.550 --> 05:00.650
STOP RUNNING AT THE BEAK.

05:00.720 --> 05:01.950
I CAN HANDLE MY OWN
INTERVIEWS.

05:02.020 --> 05:03.320
MM-HMM!

05:03.390 --> 05:04.390
WERE YOU EVER AFRAID,
MR. DANGER?

05:04.450 --> 05:05.590
OH, NO!

05:05.660 --> 05:07.020
A TRUE ACTION HERO DOESN'T

05:07.090 --> 05:08.320
HAVE TIME TO BE AFRAID.

05:08.390 --> 05:10.860
HE'S TOO BUSY BEING
READY FOR ACTION.

05:10.930 --> 05:13.660
WHY, I CAN'T EVEN SPELL
THE WORD FEAR.

05:13.730 --> 05:16.530
HE CAN'T SPELL
VERY MANY WORDS, PERIOD.

05:16.600 --> 05:19.270
HOW DO THE OTHER LOONATICS
FEEL ABOUT YOUR SAVING THE DAY?

05:19.340 --> 05:21.410
OH, THEY'RE USED TO IT.

05:24.070 --> 05:26.910
EH, BUT THEY
DO ALL HELP.

05:26.980 --> 05:28.680
UH, I MEAN, WHERE WOULD
WE BE WITHOUT

05:28.750 --> 05:31.050
ACE, DRIVING ME
TO THE ACTION?

05:31.110 --> 05:32.920
AND LEXI,
CHEERING ME ON.

05:32.980 --> 05:35.020
AND REV, BLATHERING ON.
AND SLAM--WELL, FORGET SLAM.

05:35.080 --> 05:36.450
HUH?

05:36.520 --> 05:41.120
AND TECH! TECH, HE IS
OUR RESIDENT MR. FIX-IT-GUY.

05:41.190 --> 05:42.590
WHY, WHENEVER
THE TOILET BACKS UP,

05:42.660 --> 05:44.160
WE ALWAYS KNOW WHO TO CALL.

05:45.330 --> 05:46.560
GRR.

05:46.630 --> 05:48.060
BUT ARE YOU WORRIED
ABOUT THE STOMPER?

05:48.130 --> 05:50.800
I MEAN, HE'S BROKEN OUT OF
EVERY JAIL HE'S EVER BEEN IN!

05:50.870 --> 05:52.570
I'M NOT WORRIED FOR--
EVERY JAIL?

05:52.640 --> 05:53.800
AND EACH TIME,

05:53.870 --> 05:55.840
HE'S GOTTEN WHOEVER
PUT HIM THERE.

05:55.910 --> 05:57.010
OH...

05:57.070 --> 05:59.180
WHOEVER PUT HIM...THERE?

06:00.240 --> 06:00.880
HA HA HA!

06:00.940 --> 06:01.650
NONSENSE!

06:01.710 --> 06:03.550
NO 500-POUND THUG'S GONNA

06:03.610 --> 06:05.310
INTIMIDATE DANGER DUCK!

06:05.380 --> 06:08.050
ESPECIALLY WHEN
HE'S BEHIND BARS!

06:09.290 --> 06:12.020
EXACTLY HOW
THICK ARE THOSE BARS?

06:15.390 --> 06:16.830
DRIVE?

06:16.890 --> 06:17.760
CHEER?

06:17.830 --> 06:19.160
FIX TOILETS?

06:19.230 --> 06:20.700
BAD DUCK!

06:20.760 --> 06:23.800
HEY, HEY!
I WAS QUOTED OUT OF CONTEXT.

06:23.870 --> 06:26.470
I'LL SHOW YOU
OUT OF CONTEXT.

06:26.540 --> 06:28.040
OW! HEY!

06:28.100 --> 06:30.340
THAT'S NO WAY TO TREAT
A NATIONAL TREASURE.

06:30.410 --> 06:32.010
BREAKING NEWS.

06:32.080 --> 06:33.040
AS ONE CRIMINAL WAS--

06:33.110 --> 06:34.310
LOOKS LIKE
WE GOT TROUBLE.

06:34.380 --> 06:36.180
IT APPEARS WHEN
OUR "NATIONAL TREASURE"

06:36.250 --> 06:37.110
SAVED THE DAY,

06:37.180 --> 06:38.310
HE UNWITTINGLY UNLEASHED

06:38.380 --> 06:39.280
A BOLT THAT FREED

06:39.350 --> 06:40.220
DR. DARE FROM

06:40.280 --> 06:41.620
HIS STONY STATUE PRISON.

06:41.690 --> 06:42.820
HEY.

06:42.890 --> 06:44.890
YOU CAN'T MAKE AN OMELET
WITHOUT BREAKING A FEW EGGS.

06:44.950 --> 06:47.720
DR. DARE'S ALREADY CREATED
NEW BOTS,

06:47.790 --> 06:49.690
AND IS ATTACKING
THE MUSEUM OF GREEK HISTORY!

06:49.760 --> 06:52.000
LET'S GO TEACH DR. DARE
A LITTLE SOMETHING

06:52.060 --> 06:53.530
ABOUT THE PAST.

07:02.170 --> 07:03.270
YEP.

07:03.340 --> 07:05.110
LOOKS LIKE DARE'S
BEEN HERE.

07:07.210 --> 07:09.210
SO, HOW ARE YOU GONNA
SAVE THE DAY THIS TIME,

07:09.280 --> 07:10.610
DANGER DANGER DUCK?

07:10.680 --> 07:12.450
SORRY, BUT ACMETROPOLIS'
FAVORITE ACTION HERO

07:12.520 --> 07:16.190
NEVER REVEALS HIS MOVES
BEFORE SHOWTIME!

07:16.250 --> 07:17.520
DUCK!

07:17.590 --> 07:18.660
WHAT?

07:18.720 --> 07:20.160
I THOUGHT WE COULD USE
THE PRESS.

07:20.220 --> 07:22.490
SO I INVITED HIM ALONG.

07:22.560 --> 07:23.730
WHAT A SCOOP!

07:23.790 --> 07:25.530
GETTING TO WATCH
A REAL ACTION HERO...

07:25.600 --> 07:27.830
IN ACTION!

07:27.900 --> 07:31.270
BUT WHAT WAS IT
THAT DR. DARE TOOK?

07:31.330 --> 07:32.540
LOOK!

07:32.600 --> 07:34.100
THE SHIELD OF PERSEUS
IS MISSING!

07:34.170 --> 07:37.710
WHAT CAN YOU POSSIBLY DO
WITH AN OLD SHIELD?

07:41.310 --> 07:42.550
AT LAST!

07:42.610 --> 07:47.180
GET READY, ACMETROPOLIS.
I'M BACK!

07:47.250 --> 07:48.250
AND THIS TIME,

07:48.320 --> 07:49.650
MY CONQUEST OF
SURFACE WORLD

07:49.720 --> 07:53.490
WILL NOT BE DENIED!

07:53.560 --> 07:55.790
THE SHIELD THAT HOLDS
THE REFLECTION OF THE FACE

07:55.860 --> 07:57.990
OF THE MEDUSA
IS MINE!

07:58.060 --> 07:58.960
WITH IT,

07:59.030 --> 08:00.160
I CAN CREATE

08:00.230 --> 08:02.930
A VERY UNIQUE ROCK GARDEN.

08:08.470 --> 08:10.110
HA HA HA!

08:19.380 --> 08:20.780
GOOD JOB, TEAM.

08:20.850 --> 08:23.550
I'D GIVE YOU ALL RAISES,
ONLY WE DON'T GET PAID.

08:23.620 --> 08:25.190
OH, DANGER DANGER DUCK!

08:25.250 --> 08:27.660
OH! YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE.

08:27.720 --> 08:29.590
BUT IN THE FUTURE,
I PREFER DAISIES.

08:29.660 --> 08:30.490
THEY CAME
WHILE YOU WERE OUT.

08:30.560 --> 08:31.730
WELL, WELL.

08:31.800 --> 08:33.830
MUST HAVE
A SECRET ADMIRER

08:33.900 --> 08:37.000
WHO HAS A THING FOR
BRAVE, HANDSOME ACTION HEROES.

08:37.070 --> 08:37.900
AHEM.

08:37.970 --> 08:39.700
"HOPE YOU LIKE THE FLOWERS,

08:39.770 --> 08:41.810
'CAUSE YOU'LL BE PUSHING
THEM UP SOON."

08:41.870 --> 08:44.770
HOW SWEET!
"AS IN 6 FEET UNDER THEM."

08:44.840 --> 08:47.280
"YOURS TRULY,
THE STOMPER."

08:47.340 --> 08:49.180
UH.

08:49.250 --> 08:50.750
AAH!

08:52.850 --> 08:54.450
IS THIS SOME KIND
OF SICK JOKE?

08:54.520 --> 08:55.750
YOU DID IT! 'FESS UP!

08:55.820 --> 08:57.690
I KNOW YOU'RE ALL JEALOUS
OF MY FAME.

08:57.750 --> 09:01.260
I WAS BUSY FIXING WHAT
YOU BROKE THE WHOLE TIME.

09:01.320 --> 09:02.330
AND I WAS HELPING.

09:02.390 --> 09:03.490
YOU WERE?

09:03.560 --> 09:05.260
HA HA!
WHAT'S WRONG, DUCK?

09:05.330 --> 09:08.230
I THOUGHT YOU COULDN'T
SPELL THE WORD FEAR.

09:08.300 --> 09:09.570
FEAR.

09:09.630 --> 09:14.200
F-E-E...

09:14.270 --> 09:17.870
E...R-E!

09:17.940 --> 09:18.980
NOPE, STILL CAN'T SPELL IT.

09:28.650 --> 09:30.790
PLEASE DO NOT FEED
THE PRISONERS.

09:30.850 --> 09:33.620
KEEP YOUR HANDS AND FEET
AWAY FROM THE BARS.

09:33.690 --> 09:35.260
MR. DANGER DANGER DUCK,

09:35.320 --> 09:36.760
EXACTLY WHY ARE WE HERE?

09:36.830 --> 09:38.900
HEH HEH, WELL,
I SUGGESTED TO ACE

09:38.960 --> 09:40.800
WE COME HERE NOT
TO SEE IF THE STOMPER

09:40.860 --> 09:41.870
IS STILL LOCKED UP.

09:41.930 --> 09:43.330
NO, NO, NO,
NO, NO, NO, NO!

09:43.400 --> 09:44.630
I JUST LIKE TO VISIT

09:44.700 --> 09:46.500
ALL THE BAD GUYS I PUT AWAY.

09:46.570 --> 09:47.700
HEY! MAD PETE,
HOW'S IT GOING?

09:47.770 --> 09:49.610
GET LOST,
BIRDBREATH!

09:49.670 --> 09:51.510
NO-NOSE!
SEE YOU'RE KEEPING FIT.

09:51.570 --> 09:53.010
HORSE-FEATHER BUTT!

09:53.080 --> 09:55.610
PEG LEG!
STANDING TALL AS ALWAYS.

09:55.680 --> 09:57.280
JUST LIKE A REAL LOSER!

09:57.350 --> 09:58.750
WHAT A SCOOP!

09:58.820 --> 10:00.750
CRIMEFIGHTER AND CRIME-DOER
MEET FOR THE FIRST TIME

10:00.820 --> 10:02.220
AFTER THE INCIDENT.

10:02.290 --> 10:03.520
ASSUMING THAT
HE'S STILL LOCKED UP.

10:05.760 --> 10:08.420
'ELLO, DUCK!

10:08.490 --> 10:10.990
I'VE BEEN EXPECTING YOU.

10:11.060 --> 10:14.230
SO, STOMPER, GONNA GROVEL
BEFORE THE MIGHT OF THE HERO

10:14.300 --> 10:15.400
WHO LOCKED YOU UP?

10:15.460 --> 10:17.130
THE EMPEROR OF GOOD?

10:17.200 --> 10:19.170
Both: EMPEROR OF GOOD?

10:19.240 --> 10:21.540
IT'S JUST
A POSSIBLE NICKNAME,

10:21.600 --> 10:23.570
BUT MAYBE IT'S NOT SUCH
A GOOD IDEA.

10:26.040 --> 10:29.350
WELL, BEEN NICE CHATTING
WITH YOU, MR. STOMPER, SIR.

10:29.410 --> 10:30.550
GOTTA GO!

10:30.610 --> 10:31.350
MR. DANGER DANGER DUCK!

10:31.410 --> 10:33.150
TOODLES!

10:35.520 --> 10:37.090
HMM.

10:48.730 --> 10:50.370
HUH

10:52.240 --> 10:53.200
AGH!

10:57.540 --> 10:59.180
I WANT MY MOMMY!

11:03.480 --> 11:04.980
AAH!

11:06.520 --> 11:07.720
ECCH!

11:11.220 --> 11:12.560
WHAT?

11:12.620 --> 11:13.790
HE'S HERE!
HE'S HERE, I TELL YA!

11:13.860 --> 11:16.660
HE...DROPPED A COW ON ME!

11:16.730 --> 11:18.090
A COW?

11:18.160 --> 11:19.200
A BIG ONE!

11:19.260 --> 11:20.900
WITH UDDERS AND HOOVES.
THE WHOLE PACKAGE!

11:22.900 --> 11:25.030
CAREFUL.
HE'S GOT A COW,

11:25.100 --> 11:26.900
AND HE'S NOT AFRAID
TO USE IT.

11:28.840 --> 11:30.210
SEE

11:30.270 --> 11:31.940
YAAH!

11:33.980 --> 11:37.350
I THINK SOMEONE'S
HAVING A BAD DREAM.

11:37.410 --> 11:39.720
PROBABLY BROUGHT ON
BY A GUILTY CONSCIENCE.

11:39.780 --> 11:42.120
FOR TAKING CREDIT
HE SHOULDN'T HAVE.

11:42.190 --> 11:44.090
HEY, NEXT TIME
IT HAPPENS, DUCK,

11:44.150 --> 11:45.150
YES

11:45.220 --> 11:46.390
DON'T WAKE US.

11:47.790 --> 11:49.360
OH, DON'T WORRY, I WON'T.

11:49.430 --> 11:51.590
HA HA--IT--IT'S NOT LIKE
I'M AFRAID.

11:51.660 --> 11:53.160
I JUST THOUGHT
YOU'D WANT TO KNOW.

11:53.230 --> 11:56.230
UH, WOULD YOU MIND LEAVING
THE DOOR OPEN A CRACK?

11:56.300 --> 11:57.370
THEY'RE RIGHT.

11:57.430 --> 11:59.100
PROBABLY JUST
AN OVERACTIVE IMAGINATION.

11:59.170 --> 12:02.140
THERE'S ONLY ONE THING
FOR AN ACTION HERO TO DO.

12:02.210 --> 12:05.780
HIDE IN TERROR!

12:10.850 --> 12:14.380
AT LAST I'LL HAVE
MY REVENGE!

12:19.420 --> 12:20.920
AND WHEN I'M DONE,

12:20.990 --> 12:24.230
ACMETROPOLIS WILL ROCK
BUT NOT ROLL.

12:24.290 --> 12:25.390
HA HA!

12:29.870 --> 12:31.170
YOU GOT ROCKS
IN YOUR HEAD

12:31.230 --> 12:33.000
IF YOU THINK
YOU'LL GET AWAY WITH THIS!

12:33.070 --> 12:37.670
LET'S SEE HOW YOU ALL
LIKE BEING STATUES FOREVER!

12:45.710 --> 12:47.880
HA HA HA!

12:47.950 --> 12:50.690
RISE, MY BOULDER ARMY!

12:50.750 --> 12:53.020
TIME TO ROCK!

13:05.430 --> 13:07.940
NICE ONE, LEX!

13:11.410 --> 13:14.040
TIME TO PHASE OUT
THESE ROCKS.

13:26.660 --> 13:28.520
FOILED AGAIN!

13:28.590 --> 13:30.830
NO!

13:32.300 --> 13:32.830
WHAT?

13:32.900 --> 13:37.170
OH! UHH!

13:37.230 --> 13:38.170
AAH!

13:38.230 --> 13:40.540
OH!

13:45.070 --> 13:47.140
GREAT JOB, TECH.

13:48.080 --> 13:49.410
HOLD THE PRESSES!

13:49.480 --> 13:51.350
GEE, ANOTHER CRIME SOLVED.

13:51.410 --> 13:52.020
WHAT A SCOOP!

13:52.080 --> 13:53.550
DUCK DOES IT AGAIN!

13:53.620 --> 13:54.920
AH, NO, NO, NO!

13:54.980 --> 13:56.190
IT WAS TECH
WHO SAVED THE DAY.

13:56.250 --> 13:57.720
OH, YEAH!
HE'S THE HERO!

13:57.790 --> 13:58.920
YEP, TECH'S THE MAN!

13:58.990 --> 14:01.520
THAT'S TECH,
T-E...KA

14:01.590 --> 14:03.490
AND, UH, HE WAS THE ONE
WHO REALLY CAPTURED

14:03.560 --> 14:04.660
THE STOMPER, TOO.

14:04.730 --> 14:06.000
YEAH, HE DESERVES
ALL THE BLAME--

14:06.060 --> 14:07.960
I--I MEAN, CREDIT.

14:09.100 --> 14:11.270
IN ONE OF THE MOST
HEROIC ACTS EVER SEEN,

14:11.330 --> 14:13.670
TECH E. COYOTE SAVED
ACMETROPOLIS

14:13.740 --> 14:15.200
FROM THE FEARSOME
DR. DARE.

14:15.270 --> 14:17.210
IT HAS BEEN LEARNED
THAT CREDIT FOR THE CAPTURE

14:17.270 --> 14:19.080
OF THE INFAMOUS STOMPER
ALSO BELONGS

14:19.140 --> 14:22.210
TO OUR NEW HERO,
AND HIS A.P.D. INVENTION.

14:22.280 --> 14:25.280
AHH. ALL'S NOW
RIGHT WITH THE WORLD.

14:32.560 --> 14:34.020
WHOA!

14:34.090 --> 14:36.190
LOOKS LIKE SOMEONE
HAS A SECRET ADMIRER.

14:36.260 --> 14:39.560
"DEAR TECH,
YOUR DAYS ARE NUMBERED.

14:39.630 --> 14:42.000
AND IT'S A VERY LOW NUMBER.

14:42.070 --> 14:44.730
YOUR FRIEND"--

14:44.800 --> 14:45.970
"THE STOMPER."

14:46.040 --> 14:48.140
HA! I--I MEAN, HA.

14:48.200 --> 14:49.910
MUST BE SOME KIND
OF JOKE, RIGHT?

14:49.970 --> 14:52.040
BUT, BETTER YOU
THAN ME, EH?

14:52.110 --> 14:55.380
"P.S. I'M STILL GONNA
GET THE DUCK, TOO."

14:57.450 --> 15:01.020
YOU TOOK THE SHUDDER
RIGHT OUT OF MY MOUTH.

15:05.090 --> 15:07.590
NOW, YOU KNOW
WE'RE JUST HERE

15:07.660 --> 15:08.820
TO MAKE ACE FEEL AT EASE.

15:08.890 --> 15:10.730
YES!
WE DON'T WANT ACE

15:10.790 --> 15:12.400
TO BE NERVOUS
ABOUT THE STOMPER.

15:12.460 --> 15:13.800
THANKS, GUYS.

15:13.860 --> 15:16.330
YOU CAN ALL LET GO
OF MY HANDS NOW.

15:18.930 --> 15:20.400
Both: AAH!

15:23.810 --> 15:24.710
AHEM. OH.

15:24.770 --> 15:26.880
IF YOU DON'T MIND,

15:26.940 --> 15:28.910
I WAS TAKING A NAP.

15:28.980 --> 15:30.180
SEE? TOLD YOU
HE WAS HERE.

15:30.250 --> 15:32.250
USE ONE OF YOUR GIZMOS
TO CHECK THE CELL.

15:36.050 --> 15:40.160
AH, YEP.
COMPLETELY IMPREGNABLE.

15:40.220 --> 15:42.260
NOTHING AND NO ONE
COULD GET OUT.

15:42.330 --> 15:43.090
ALL RIGHT.

15:43.160 --> 15:44.190
NOTHING TO DO
BUT GO HOME

15:44.260 --> 15:45.260
AND GET
A GOOD NIGHT'S SLEEP.

15:45.330 --> 15:47.200
FUNNY THING ABOUT SLEEP.

15:47.260 --> 15:50.170
YOU NEVER KNOW
IF YOU'RE GONNA WAKE UP.

15:53.040 --> 15:54.440
NEW HOBBY?

15:54.500 --> 15:58.170
IT MAKES THE YEARS
JUST FLY BY.

16:05.180 --> 16:06.450
- NO, REALLY.

16:06.520 --> 16:07.850
I'VE BEEN PLANNING THIS
VACATION FOR MONTHS.

16:07.920 --> 16:08.720
DIDN'T I TELL YA?

16:08.780 --> 16:10.320
UH, NO.

16:10.390 --> 16:11.050
LEXI?

16:11.120 --> 16:12.760
DIDN'T TELL ME.

16:12.820 --> 16:13.860
SLAM?

16:13.920 --> 16:14.860
I THOUGHT HE SAID

16:14.920 --> 16:15.990
HE DIDN'T NEED TO HAVE ONE.

16:16.060 --> 16:17.860
YOU CAN'T TAKE
TOO MANY VACATIONS

16:17.930 --> 16:19.160
WHEN YOU'RE FIGHTING CRIME.

16:19.230 --> 16:20.930
KEEPS YOU SHARP
AS A PISTOL.

16:21.000 --> 16:22.130
I SECOND THAT.

16:22.200 --> 16:23.700
I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO SEE

16:23.770 --> 16:25.170
THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WORLD.

16:25.230 --> 16:27.800
LOOK, GUYS.
WE SAW THE STOMPER.

16:27.870 --> 16:29.870
HE'S SAFE BEHIND BARS.

16:29.940 --> 16:30.970
THE STOMPER?

16:31.040 --> 16:32.740
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

16:32.810 --> 16:35.340
WE'RE NOT LEAVING BECAUSE
THAT BLOODTHIRSTY MANIAC

16:35.410 --> 16:36.910
SWORE TO GET REVENGE
AND KEEPS DROPPING

16:36.980 --> 16:38.850
HEAVY OBJECTS ON US
WHEREVER WE GO.

16:38.910 --> 16:40.680
ABSOLUTELY NOT!

16:43.620 --> 16:44.620
- AAH!
- YIKES!

16:44.690 --> 16:45.750
WE PROMISE TO WRITE!

16:45.820 --> 16:46.790
EVERY DAY.

16:46.860 --> 16:48.220
HUH.

17:03.940 --> 17:05.770
WELL, UH,
TIME TO TURN IN.

17:05.840 --> 17:07.410
YEAH, I'M BEAT.

17:07.480 --> 17:10.510
ALL THIS HIDING,
I MEAN, VACATIONING,

17:10.580 --> 17:11.610
IS A LOTTA WORK.

17:20.860 --> 17:22.860
'ELLO, YOUS TWO!

17:24.560 --> 17:28.600
IT'S HIM.
IT--IT--IT'S HIM!

17:28.660 --> 17:30.370
Both: AAH!

17:30.430 --> 17:32.240
ISN'T IT BAD ENOUGH
THAT HE'S HERE

17:32.300 --> 17:33.700
WITHOUT MAKING IT
EASY FOR HIM?

17:33.770 --> 17:35.000
DON'T WORRY.

17:35.070 --> 17:37.370
I'VE ACTIVATED
A SOPHISTICATED BOOBY TRAP.

17:37.440 --> 17:40.310
THIS IS BETTER THAN
CLUBBING FISH IN A BARREL.

17:40.380 --> 17:41.780
AND I'VE DONE THAT.

17:44.080 --> 17:45.010
HUH?

17:49.250 --> 17:51.890
GETTING US TRAPPED FIRST
WAS PART OF THE BIGGER TRAP

17:51.950 --> 17:53.190
TO LURE THE STOMPER CLOSER.

17:53.260 --> 17:55.560
THAT WAS BRILLIANT!

17:55.620 --> 17:57.960
Both: AAH!

17:58.030 --> 18:00.730
BRILLIANTLY IDIOTIC!
RUN!

18:04.230 --> 18:07.770
OLLIE OLLIE OXEN FREE!

18:14.140 --> 18:15.840
ARGH!

18:26.960 --> 18:28.660
OOH!

18:28.720 --> 18:29.960
Both: OOF!

18:30.030 --> 18:31.990
OH, MAYBE HIDING
IN THE SEWERS

18:32.060 --> 18:33.260
WASN'T SUCH A GREAT IDEA.

18:33.330 --> 18:35.600
NOW WE'RE REALLY TRAPPED
LIKE RATS.

18:35.660 --> 18:38.130
HUH?

18:38.200 --> 18:39.130
Both: AAH!

18:39.200 --> 18:41.040
HEY, WAIT.
PUT ME DOWN!

18:41.100 --> 18:42.910
I'LL TAKE CARE
OF YOU FIRST.

18:42.970 --> 18:45.610
THEN, IT'S YOUR TURN.

18:45.670 --> 18:46.810
DUCK.

18:46.880 --> 18:48.510
HEY, TAKE YOUR TIME, BUDDY.

18:48.580 --> 18:50.610
NO HURRY.
WHAT AM I DOING?

18:50.680 --> 18:51.850
I'M DANGER DUCK,

18:51.910 --> 18:54.050
THE BRAVEST ACTION HERO
ON THE PLANET.

18:54.120 --> 18:55.880
SEE? IT EVEN SAYS SO
IN PRINT

18:55.950 --> 18:58.820
AND THE PRESS
NEVER LIES!

18:58.890 --> 19:00.520
SAGITTARIUS STOMPER!

19:00.590 --> 19:02.590
I DEMAND THAT YOU DROP
THE COYOTE,

19:02.660 --> 19:05.830
OR FACE THE WRATH
OF DANGER DUCK!

19:07.530 --> 19:09.770
OH, YOU GOT SOME BEAK
ON YOU, YOU DO.

19:09.830 --> 19:12.500
NOW LET'S SEE
IF YOU CAN BACK IT UP!

19:12.570 --> 19:14.400
UHH-YAH!

19:18.870 --> 19:20.010
THANKS, DUCK.

19:24.050 --> 19:25.750
IS THAT THE BEST
YOU CAN DO?

19:30.090 --> 19:31.850
THAT ALWAYS
MAKES ME ANGRY,

19:31.920 --> 19:34.590
AND I LIKE BEING ANGRY!

19:34.660 --> 19:37.590
THAT STATEMENT'S RATHER
IRONIC AND PROFOUND,

19:37.660 --> 19:38.660
IF YOU ASK ME.

19:38.730 --> 19:40.560
NO ONE ASKED YOU.

19:40.630 --> 19:42.130
THERE'S ONLY
ONE THING TO DO.

19:42.200 --> 19:43.170
BEG FOR MERCY?

19:43.230 --> 19:44.900
YOUR WATER POWER!

19:44.970 --> 19:47.170
YOU KNOW, I NEARLY
FORGOT ABOUT THAT.

19:47.240 --> 19:49.310
EAT WATER, STOMPER!

19:49.370 --> 19:51.470
AQUA DENSE!

19:52.880 --> 19:53.810
AAH!

20:00.320 --> 20:02.290
HE--HE'S TOO STRONG!

20:02.350 --> 20:04.550
DON'T GIVE UP.
YOU CAN DO IT!

20:04.620 --> 20:05.990
AAH!

20:06.050 --> 20:07.590
UHH-UNH!

20:10.930 --> 20:12.630
OW! UHH!

20:12.700 --> 20:13.700
UHH...

20:16.500 --> 20:18.500
NICE VACATION PACKAGE.

20:18.570 --> 20:20.000
WHO'S YOUR TRAVEL AGENT?

20:20.070 --> 20:22.510
ACE? LEXI!
BUT HOW?

20:22.570 --> 20:24.270
LEXI'S SUPER EARS.

20:24.340 --> 20:26.240
SHE PICKED UP THE STOMPER'S
DISTANT WHISTLING.

20:26.310 --> 20:29.310
SO WE FOLLOWED
THE FOLLOWER.

20:29.380 --> 20:31.180
I FOLLOW. BUT HOW DID
HE GET OUT OF JAIL?

20:31.250 --> 20:34.720
HE DIDN'T.

20:34.780 --> 20:37.490
I GOT A LITTLE SURPRISE
FOR YOU FELLAS.

20:39.960 --> 20:41.590
WHAT'S THIS?

20:41.660 --> 20:43.330
2 STOMPERS?

20:43.390 --> 20:46.560
OH, GREAT. TWICE THE UGLY
FOR HALF THE FUN.

20:46.630 --> 20:48.560
I FIGURED IT ALL OUT
FROM THE CLUES.

20:48.630 --> 20:50.970
PINK TOOTHBRUSH,
CROCHETING,

20:51.030 --> 20:52.370
AND THEN IT COMES TO ME.

20:52.440 --> 20:55.800
STOMPER'S MUM USED TO BE
A LEADING BIONIC SCIENTIST.

20:55.870 --> 20:59.140
SHE WAS THE ONE WHO BUILT
STOMPER'S ARMS AND LEGS.

20:59.210 --> 21:01.810
HE'S REALLY A GOOD BOY.

21:01.880 --> 21:04.180
SHE SWITCHED PLACES
WITH SONNY BOY

21:04.250 --> 21:05.380
BACK WHEN
HE WAS CAPTURED,

21:05.450 --> 21:07.220
LEAVING THE REAL
SAGITTARIUS STOMPER

21:07.280 --> 21:09.150
FREE TO GET
HIS REVENGE ON DUCK,

21:09.220 --> 21:12.090
WHILE GIVING HIM
AN AIRTIGHT ALIBI.

21:12.150 --> 21:15.190
I TOLD YOU
HE WAS A GOOD BOY.

21:15.260 --> 21:17.260
YEAH. THE STOMPER
AND HIS MUM

21:17.330 --> 21:19.630
WILL BE LOCKED UP,
ONCE AND FOR ALL.

21:19.700 --> 21:22.700
WOW! MR. ACE BUNNY,
YOU FIGURED ALL THAT OUT?

21:22.770 --> 21:24.870
ACTUALLY, IT WAS ALL
PART OF MY INTRICATE PLAN

21:24.930 --> 21:26.100
TO SERVE JUSTICE.

21:26.170 --> 21:27.940
WHEN YOU'RE DEALING WITH
A CRIMINAL LIKE THE STOMPER,

21:28.000 --> 21:30.270
YOU'RE BASICALLY DEALING
WITH A DUMB ANIMAL.

21:30.340 --> 21:31.540
I KNEW BY USING MY WITS

21:31.610 --> 21:32.610
THE POOR, PATHETIC BEAST

21:32.680 --> 21:34.010
WOULDN'T STAND A CHANCE.

21:34.080 --> 21:35.240
IT WAS ONLY A MATTER OF TIME

21:35.310 --> 21:36.380
BEFORE I HOOKED MY PREY

21:36.450 --> 21:39.580
AND HAD HIM, UH--YAH!

21:41.820 --> 21:43.090
BEGGING?

21:43.150 --> 21:44.290
HA HA!

21:44.350 --> 21:45.590
LOVE TO STAY AND REMINISCE,

21:45.650 --> 21:47.020
BUT LATE FOR MY WORKOUT.

21:47.090 --> 21:49.190
RUN FOR YOUR LIFE!

21:49.260 --> 21:50.830
OH!

21:50.890 --> 21:52.090
YAH AAH AAH! HELP!

21:52.160 --> 21:53.530
IT'S HIM! IT'S HIM!

21:53.600 --> 21:56.430
OH, PLEASE!
NO MORE DROPPING THINGS!

21:56.500 --> 21:57.730
NOT ANOTHER COW!
