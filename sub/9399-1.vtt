- It's Clothes Over Bro's, Nick.

13:15.995 --> 13:17.792
We want the tabloids to think
that she's sleeping with you.

13:17.863 --> 13:21.162
She's not actually sleeping with you.
We're all set.

13:22.101 --> 13:23.728
Call me.

13:27.439 --> 13:28.599
Taxi!

13:29.208 --> 13:32.541
You are unbelievably rude.

13:32.878 --> 13:35.870
Yeah, well, it's been a long day.
But tomorrow's even longer.

13:36.816 --> 13:39.808
You have a 9:00 a.m. Interview
about taking the company public.

13:40.052 --> 13:42.452
I'll be there for the finer points.
You just need to look beautiful

13:42.521 --> 13:45.319
and talk about your passion and
your creativity, and blah, blah, blah.

13:45.391 --> 13:48.224
And I've made a change
to the model lineup.

13:48.561 --> 13:51.553
Due to the additional scrutiny
from the press.

13:52.832 --> 13:55.665
- Oh, but you forgot...
- Yeah, she's not on the list.

13:56.468 --> 13:57.696
She's my friend.

13:57.770 --> 14:00.568
She's not your friend, she's an employee.

14:01.874 --> 14:03.671
Well, I'm not sure
I'm comfortable with that.

14:03.742 --> 14:07.542
Brooke. Clothes Over Bro's is
a multi-million-dollar company.

14:07.613 --> 14:08.602
Yeah.

14:08.681 --> 14:13.345
A company that you've entrusted to me
to make executive decisions like these.

14:13.819 --> 14:14.843

14:14.920 --> 14:17.445

- You're gonna fire her?

14:17.523 --> 14:20.788
No. I'm not gonna fire her,
you're gonna fire her.

- Where are they now?

15:24.089 --> 15:27.456
Well, Aunt Karen

15:28.093 --> 15:30.618

the Irish Sea from England.

15:30.696 --> 15:32.926

You are a genius.
You sure you're not my kid?

15:43.943 --> 15:47.538
- All right. Here we go.
- You think we'll ever see them again?

15:47.613 --> 15:50.013
Oh, yeah. Of course we will, man.

15:50.616 --> 15:53.517
So, listen, I'm gonna go talk to your dad
and then we'll go, okay?

15:53.585 --> 15:55.177
- Okay.
- All right.

16:11.170 --> 16:14.833
Haley keeps the alcohol out of reach.
At least she tries.

16:14.907 --> 16:16.499
It's a little early, don't you think?

16:17.743 --> 16:19.506
So how's physical therapy going?

16:19.578 --> 16:21.808
How's your second book coming?

16:22.214 --> 16:23.374
Ouch.

16:24.817 --> 16:27.217
So you know, Haley told me
that the doctor said that you'll be

16:27.286 --> 16:30.050

You're pretty lucky, Nate.

16:30.122 --> 16:32.420
Oh, yeah. That's me. Mr. Lucky.

16:32.691 --> 16:34.682
I'm just saying you'll be
back to normal in no time.

16:34.760 --> 16:37.558
Luke, I'm never gonna play
basketball again.

16:37.629 --> 16:39.961
That's not exactly normal, okay?

16:40.766 --> 16:43.963
Luke. Luke, damn it.
Don't be a dick, all right?

16:44.036 --> 16:45.469
You want it?

16:45.671 --> 16:47.639
- Walk over here and get it.
- Why don't I walk over there

16:47.706 --> 16:50.004
- and kick your ass, huh?
- Oh, kicking. Kicking's good.

16:50.075 --> 16:51.975
- Let's see it.
- Give me that bottle right now,

16:52.044 --> 16:55.070

to kill his brother.

16:58.017 --> 16:59.746

17:05.190 --> 17:06.781
Real nice, Nate.

17:08.193 --> 17:09.683
Luke, just...

17:12.464 --> 17:15.092
- Come on, Jamie. Let's go.
- Bye, Daddy.

17:17.803 --> 17:19.167
Bye, buddy.

17:23.608 --> 17:25.599
So none of you guys know
who ate my pizza?

17:25.676 --> 17:27.770
- No, man.
- Amazing.

17:27.846 --> 17:31.282
- So my pizza just ate itself?
- Hey, I was working on my audition reel.

17:31.350 --> 17:33.580
Hey, that's good.
'Cause you owe me for the rent.

17:33.652 --> 17:36.553
And you two knuckleheads
owe me for a pizza.

17:39.158 --> 17:41.888
There he is. "Big Game" James.

17:42.528 --> 17:45.622
Hey, yo, Big Game.
I got something for you.

17:48.934 --> 17:50.060
Cool!

17:50.736 --> 17:52.260
- You wanna try it on?
- Uh-huh.

17:52.337 --> 17:53.497
All right.

17:53.572 --> 17:56.564
Put your arms through and there we go.

17:56.742 --> 17:58.232
It's perfect!

17:59.445 --> 18:01.709
Let's see what you got, baller.

18:05.684 --> 18:07.743
Dirty Uncle Skills, you always do that.

- You ever gonna let him score?
- Shorty shouldn't be in the paint.

18:11.590 --> 18:13.990
- He's gotta learn.
- Dude, he's four.

18:17.529 --> 18:19.554
What do you think, Sawyer?

18:20.532 --> 18:23.899
I think you were right
about the act we signed today.

18:24.336 --> 18:26.964
Her songs blow. So why'd you sign her?

18:27.606 --> 18:30.370
How long you been
in Los Angeles, Peyton?

18:30.442 --> 18:33.275
- From...
- From Tree Hill, North Carolina.

18:33.445 --> 18:36.380
- Four years.
- Four years. Why'd you come?

18:36.849 --> 18:41.047
I wanted to discover and sign bands
that could change someone's life,

18:41.120 --> 18:42.815
like the bands that changed mine.

18:44.089 --> 18:47.581
I figured you were one of them.
I used to be, too.

18:48.360 --> 18:52.194
Then I figured it out.
It's called show business for a reason.

18:52.764 --> 18:55.494
- We're here to make money.
- Even if the product sucks.

18:55.567 --> 18:57.933
Especially if the product sucks.

18:58.637 --> 19:00.036
I hate to be the one to break it to you,

19:00.105 --> 19:03.199
but rock and roll can't
actually save the world.

19:03.442 --> 19:05.034
See, I disagree.

19:06.178 --> 19:09.204
Walk into any club on the strip tonight
and just look at the kids.

19:09.281 --> 19:12.148
Look into their eyes. I mean, they're all
looking for something to believe in,

19:12.217 --> 19:15.152
and I think that music can be the thing
that changes their world.

19:15.220 --> 19:18.747
That is why you're still
the assistant to the assistant.

19:19.658 --> 19:21.421
They're not out there
to get their world saved.

19:21.493 --> 19:22.551
They had a bad day.

19:22.628 --> 19:25.324
They went out to get drunk and get laid.

19:26.798 --> 19:31.030
Peyton, you're as smart
and as talented as anyone at the label.

19:32.237 --> 19:34.364
But you'd be so much further along
if you could just accept

19:34.439 --> 19:37.704
the business side of what we do
and play the game.

19:38.977 --> 19:41.445
Yeah, I'm just not really
interested in playing the game.

19:41.513 --> 19:43.105
You already did.

19:43.749 --> 19:46.775
You dropped a button
to get into that meeting.

19:47.419 --> 19:50.820
Drop a few more,
they'll probably give you my job.

19:52.558 --> 19:54.651
Well, I will have your job one day, John.

19:54.726 --> 19:56.421
Just not that way.

Okay, go say goodbye to the guys.

today about not being on his feet yet.

Oh, well, you know.
I know he's a little dark right now,

21:19.144 --> 21:21.578

when you said the kids in the clubs
were just there for decadence.

29:37.675 --> 29:39.973
