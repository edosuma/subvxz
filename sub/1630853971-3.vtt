WEBVTT

00:22.333 --> 00:24.250
Take home the big prize!

00:25.291 --> 00:27.250
Anyone else? Do we have another winner?

00:34.000 --> 00:38.291
Come on, folks. Do you have
what it takes to take down Zozo?

00:38.375 --> 00:41.375
Here we go!
Let's see if you can do it. Nice!

00:41.458 --> 00:46.000
Oh! Four hits in a row
is all it takes to beat Zozo!

00:46.083 --> 00:50.666
That was a lucky throw, lucky throw!
This is for all the marbles now.

00:54.666 --> 00:59.500
Oh, Zozo's down! Do we have anyone else?
Anyone else feeling lucky?

01:00.375 --> 01:03.583
Hey! Not bad, not bad.

01:04.666 --> 01:09.375
Oh, that's one down for Zozo!
All right we got--

01:09.458 --> 01:12.083
Oh, wow! Zozo went down again!

01:12.166 --> 01:13.875
Oh! Whoa, whoa, whoa!

01:17.333 --> 01:20.375
Hey, come back for a prize next time.
You try again, all right?

01:20.458 --> 01:23.041
Hey, future star right there.

01:23.125 --> 01:24.083
All right.

01:24.583 --> 01:27.208
Ladies and gentlemen,
that is all it takes.

01:27.291 --> 01:31.541
This is the stuff dreams are made of!
Do you have what it takes?

01:31.625 --> 01:35.041
Do you have a lucky arm?
Lucky throw, a golden arm, perhaps?

02:56.166 --> 02:59.541
Step right up. Don't be shy.
In fact, be brave! Oh, no.

02:59.625 --> 03:01.333
Here comes trouble.

03:01.416 --> 03:02.875
-How are you, my good man?
-Good.

03:02.958 --> 03:05.125
-You look like you're ready to throw.
-Yes, sir.

03:05.208 --> 03:07.500
All right. I think
you know the rules of the game.

03:07.583 --> 03:11.375
Four hits in a row takes down Zozo,
and that's for all the prizes.

03:11.458 --> 03:14.750
There you go, my friend. Here we go.
How are you? Nice to see you. All right.

03:19.708 --> 03:25.541
One throw down! He's down! Oh, man.
You must play for the Major Leagues.

03:25.625 --> 03:29.625
All right. It just ain't fair, folks.
All right. Here we go.

03:33.708 --> 03:35.625
Okay! Ho, ho!

03:35.708 --> 03:39.208
Man, where did you come from, eh?
All right. One last go.

03:39.291 --> 03:43.666
You a baseball player by any chance?
You got one more. One more, my friend.

03:43.750 --> 03:45.875
One more. Here we go. Make it count.

03:45.958 --> 03:47.708
Take home all the marbles.

03:54.708 --> 03:57.750
<i>Thanks for coming</i>
<i>on down to Dreamland.</i>

03:57.833 --> 04:00.666
<i>The park closes in five minutes.</i>

04:00.750 --> 04:03.583
<i>Please make your way</i>
<i>up to the front gate exit.</i>

06:39.125 --> 06:40.750
Come on in!

06:40.833 --> 06:43.708
Feast your eyes on almost 100 years

06:43.791 --> 06:47.833
of some of the fondest recollections
a fella could hold in his head.

06:47.916 --> 06:53.625
Heck, I myself remember riding them
bumper cars back in '68 with Mavis Floyd.

06:53.708 --> 06:57.375
Then sneaking off into The Tunnel of Love
with Grace Olson

06:57.458 --> 07:00.458
while Mavis was waiting for popcorn!

07:04.208 --> 07:06.000
All right, here we go!

07:06.083 --> 07:09.333
All right, ladies and gentlemen,
grab your wallets and purses.

07:09.416 --> 07:11.041
We're gonna move some merchandise.

07:11.125 --> 07:13.958
First up on the block, we have Lot 267.

07:14.041 --> 07:17.166
A genuine bona fide
Dreamland popcorn machine.

07:17.250 --> 07:19.875
All you all with your 12-inch screens
in the living rooms,

07:19.958 --> 07:21.166
have your very own cinema.

07:21.250 --> 07:25.083
We're gonna start the bidding off at $20.
Do I have a bid of $20? Thank you, $20.

07:25.166 --> 07:27.416
Do I have 21? $21. 21, thank you.

07:27.500 --> 07:30.083
Do I have a bid higher than 22? Thank you.

07:30.166 --> 07:33.916
Do I have $23? Finish it off, 23.
We're going in. Out.

07:34.000 --> 07:35.708
Sold for $23.

07:36.458 --> 07:38.666
Now, we have some memorabilia
from Dreamland,

07:38.750 --> 07:43.541
the unexpected, remarkable, and rare,
and the biggest prize yet.

07:44.083 --> 07:49.541
We have an authentic,
genuine Balinese doll.

07:49.625 --> 07:52.958
Nina, the dancing puppet
with the jingling bells.

07:53.041 --> 07:55.458
-That's a tune to the ears, ain't it?

07:55.541 --> 07:58.416
-No. No!
-That is gold leaf sequins in the eyes,

07:58.500 --> 08:00.083
-ladies and gentlemen.
-Nina!

08:00.166 --> 08:03.458
She is a prize, and we're gonna
start the bidding off at $2.

08:04.166 --> 08:05.958
Two dollars.
Starting the bidding off at two.

08:06.041 --> 08:07.875
Can I get 2.25? How about a bid of 2.25?

08:07.958 --> 08:11.708
How about a bid of 2.25? Thank you, 2.25.
Two and a half. Can I get two and a half?

08:11.791 --> 08:14.166
2.75, how about a bid of 2.75?
Thank you, 2.75.

08:14.250 --> 08:16.375
-Three-dollar bidder. Can I get bid of $3?
-No.

08:16.458 --> 08:17.333
-Thank you, $3.
-No.

08:17.416 --> 08:20.041
3.25, how about a bid of 3.25?
3.25? Three and a half?

08:20.125 --> 08:22.625
Can I get three and a half?
Thank you, 3.50.

08:22.708 --> 08:24.833
-3.50, 3.75. 3.75, thank you.
-No!

08:24.916 --> 08:27.000
Bid of $4? Thank you, $4. How about 4.25?

08:27.083 --> 08:30.791
4.25, 4.50 now. Thank you, 4.50.
Can I get 4.75?

08:32.041 --> 08:35.666
No. No! No!

08:54.041 --> 08:57.000
Sold for 5.50. There we go.

08:57.916 --> 08:59.583
Now, there you go, little girl.

09:02.625 --> 09:05.000
-Come on, give them a round of applause.

09:05.083 --> 09:06.500
Good for you.

09:12.791 --> 09:15.625
Okay, I'll dry your eyes.
We're gonna move onto the next lot.

09:15.708 --> 09:18.125
-We got Lot 142.
-No.

09:18.208 --> 09:22.458
4.25. I have 4.25. Do I have 4.50?
Thank you, 4.50. Can I get a 4.75?

09:41.416 --> 09:47.875
4.25. I have 4.25. Do I have 4.50?
Thank you, 4.50. Can I get a 4.75?

09:47.958 --> 09:49.291
4.75, thank you...

10:01.958 --> 10:05.916
Nina! Nina!

12:36.333 --> 12:42.458
<i>Now, how about a five?</i>
<i>5.50, 5.75. 5.50, 5.75...</i>

12:58.250 --> 13:01.333
<i>Oh, Nina. At last, I am free.</i>

13:04.541 --> 13:08.791
<i>And although it seems like a lifetime</i>
<i>has passed since we parted,</i>

13:08.875 --> 13:10.875
<i>your memory sustains me.</i>

13:22.125 --> 13:24.083
<i>And neither time, nor distance,</i>

13:24.166 --> 13:27.333
<i>nor the chill of night</i>
<i>shall keep me from you.</i>

13:38.208 --> 13:41.750
<i>I saw some familiar faces</i>
<i>from Dreamland today.</i>

13:41.833 --> 13:46.625
<i>The Furberries, Lloyd and Tina,</i>
<i>even old Peanuts was there.</i>

13:47.416 --> 13:51.166
<i>My heart swelled as I hoped</i>
<i>to find you there amongst them.</i>

13:55.250 --> 13:59.083
<i>But it seems I have miles to go</i>
<i>before I sleep,</i>

13:59.166 --> 14:01.333
<i>and my search for you continues.</i>

14:18.125 --> 14:21.833
<i>A speck of hope came gliding</i>
<i>into the Kenwood Drive-In.</i>

14:42.500 --> 14:46.125
<i>Pigtails twirling</i>
<i>in front of a silver screen.</i>

14:53.000 --> 14:56.625
<i>And although I wasn't led to you,</i>
<i>sweet Nina...</i>

14:57.166 --> 14:59.083
<i>I discovered a new friend.</i>

15:12.125 --> 15:14.625
<i>I'm afraid what you describe</i>
<i>is impossible.</i>

15:14.708 --> 15:17.375
<i>I've sought Captain Bloodstone's</i>
<i>treasure for 13 years,</i>

15:17.458 --> 15:19.416
<i>and all I've done is fail.</i>

15:20.208 --> 15:22.416
<i>That's because you started alone,</i>

15:22.500 --> 15:27.541
<i>but if we worked together, you and I,</i>
<i>as partners, nothing is impossible.</i>

15:45.958 --> 15:48.958
<i>She was as battered as I once was.</i>

15:49.041 --> 15:52.875
<i>But I mended her,</i>
<i>as you once mended my heart.</i>

15:56.041 --> 15:59.500
<i>She is perhaps</i>
<i>the toughest creature I ever met.</i>

15:59.583 --> 16:01.416
<i>Loyal, brave,</i>

16:01.958 --> 16:06.833
<i>a warrior sewn and stuffed into the body</i>
<i>of a candy-colored teddy bear.</i>

16:10.625 --> 16:12.541
<i>Lord, she's got a mouth on her.</i>

16:12.625 --> 16:16.375
<i>She sounds like a hillbilly trucker</i>
<i>at a bar on payday.</i>

16:17.583 --> 16:24.416
<i>But although she'd never admit it,</i>
<i>she has the kindest, sweetest soul.</i>

16:35.000 --> 16:41.125
<i>And while nothing, nothing could</i>
<i>ever replace your presence, my dear Nina,</i>

16:41.208 --> 16:46.458
<i>she's become a true friend and is</i>
<i>as committed to finding you as I am.</i>

16:48.541 --> 16:51.416
<i>The road is less lonely</i>
<i>with her by my side.</i>

17:16.166 --> 17:18.791
<i>Years I've searched for you now, Nina.</i>

17:22.250 --> 17:24.458
<i>But not a whisper of your presence.</i>

17:55.166 --> 17:56.958
<i>I hold to hope, Nina.</i>

18:11.250 --> 18:14.750
<i>But I'm beginning to believe</i>
<i>that there is none to be found.</i>

18:23.958 --> 18:26.750
<i>It has cast a shadow upon my soul.</i>

18:27.458 --> 18:29.791
<i>A shadow that grows by the hour.</i>

18:31.041 --> 18:34.208
<i>And I fear that it shall soon overtake me.</i>

19:00.250 --> 19:03.875
<i>My sorrow has pushed me</i>
<i>to do dark things, Nina.</i>

19:04.541 --> 19:06.875
<i>I am drowning in the horror of it.</i>

19:08.250 --> 19:11.958
<i>And I refuse to drag Rosy down with me.</i>

19:44.375 --> 19:48.625
<i>I have returned to the place</i>
<i>I first searched for you, my beloved Nina.</i>

19:49.708 --> 19:52.375
<i>Our Dreamland friends are all gone.</i>

19:53.333 --> 19:54.625
<i>Just memories now.</i>

20:23.208 --> 20:27.750
<i>It's been said that time passes over us,</i>
<i>but leaves its shadow behind.</i>

20:30.875 --> 20:32.750
<i>I'm lost in that shadow.</i>

20:33.750 --> 20:36.666
<i>Drifting from light into darkness,</i>

20:36.750 --> 20:39.125
<i>as the years march on...</i>

20:40.083 --> 20:41.125
<i>and on...</i>

20:43.375 --> 20:44.375
<i>and on.</i>

22:04.416 --> 22:08.416
<i>Dear Rosy, Nina is lost.</i>

22:09.666 --> 22:11.875
<i>I fear I'm lost too.</i>

22:13.958 --> 22:15.500
<i>Do not follow me.</i>

22:16.291 --> 22:18.583
<i>I have no wish to be found.</i>

22:22.166 --> 22:24.541
<i>I thank you for all your efforts.</i>

22:26.083 --> 22:27.541
<i>Your true friend...</i>

22:28.541 --> 22:29.541
<i>Z.</i>

22:41.166 --> 22:43.875
<i>You are lost to me, my Nina.</i>

22:44.791 --> 22:47.166
<i>And I fear I am lost as well.</i>

22:48.208 --> 22:50.750
<i>All color has left the world,</i>

22:51.375 --> 22:54.166
<i>and what fragments remain of you...</i>

22:55.333 --> 22:57.208
<i>are the memory of your face...</i>

22:58.291 --> 23:01.083
<i>and the sound of your sweet--</i>

23:38.708 --> 23:43.000
Ollie, I'm getting very tired of asking.

23:43.083 --> 23:47.916
Where in the hell
did you get my Nina's bell?

23:48.500 --> 23:51.083
I told you, I don't know.

23:51.166 --> 23:53.000
Oh, please untie me.

23:53.083 --> 23:54.375
Please let me go.

23:55.166 --> 23:56.750
You were gonna take me home,

23:56.833 --> 23:58.500
help me find Billy.

23:59.041 --> 24:01.250
-You promised.
-Shut up! Just shut up!

24:02.875 --> 24:06.166
All your yammering about Billy
has gotten us nowhere.

24:06.250 --> 24:08.375
Zozo, this ain't you.

24:08.458 --> 24:13.041
You're kind and funny,
and you play pretend--

24:13.125 --> 24:15.625
Life ain't no silly game of pretend!

24:15.708 --> 24:17.125
Things get lost!

24:19.583 --> 24:20.583
You've seen her!

24:21.208 --> 24:22.875
You have her bell.

24:23.375 --> 24:26.875
Where is Nina?

24:29.166 --> 24:31.875
Rosy? Help him.

24:40.958 --> 24:42.458
I'm sorry, Zozo.

24:43.125 --> 24:44.208
I really am.

24:44.958 --> 24:46.583
I just want to go home.

24:49.291 --> 24:51.708
I got bad news for you.

24:56.625 --> 24:58.291
You ain't going home.

25:07.583 --> 25:11.791
And I'm gonna pull you apart,
stitch by stitch,

25:11.875 --> 25:15.958
until you tell me what I need to know.

25:16.625 --> 25:17.583
Zo, wait.

25:22.125 --> 25:25.125
If you jump to that now,
you may never find out the truth.

25:27.375 --> 25:28.833
Go for a stroll.

25:28.916 --> 25:30.416
Let me see what I can do.

25:35.958 --> 25:38.375
Fine, you take a stab at him.

25:39.250 --> 25:43.041
Now, I know you can sometimes
be a bit soft on these things.

25:43.125 --> 25:45.000
So don't let me down, girl.

25:57.625 --> 26:00.875
Rosy, are you gonna be okay?

26:01.750 --> 26:03.208
Am I gonna be okay?

26:04.958 --> 26:06.541
I'm a part of this, Ollie.

26:07.708 --> 26:11.625
I'm a part of all these ugly things
that are happening to you.

27:09.750 --> 27:10.916
Hey, Billy?

27:18.958 --> 27:19.833
Bill?

27:25.291 --> 27:26.791
Come on, Billy, let's eat.

27:28.541 --> 27:29.375
Come on.

27:36.041 --> 27:37.208
Where you at, Bill?

27:49.458 --> 27:50.500
Billy!

28:25.833 --> 28:26.708
Rosy?

28:28.208 --> 28:29.541
What happens next?

28:31.000 --> 28:32.041
I don't know.

28:33.083 --> 28:34.583
I ain't decided yet.

28:35.125 --> 28:37.791
You don't always have to do
what Zozo says.

28:39.500 --> 28:40.333
You could--

28:40.416 --> 28:43.166
I don't always have to do anything!
I got a mind of my own.

28:50.500 --> 28:52.166
He wasn't always like this.

28:54.458 --> 28:57.875
First thing I remember
was Zozo's face looking down at me.

28:59.875 --> 29:03.333
<i>He was all smiling,</i>
<i>like he was pleased as punch to see me.</i>

29:05.416 --> 29:06.791
<i>Those were better days.</i>

29:08.875 --> 29:10.833
<i>We traveled the world together.</i>

29:12.416 --> 29:15.208
<i>He was funny and kind and sweet.</i>

29:16.166 --> 29:17.583
He was beautiful.

29:18.708 --> 29:20.333
That's when I saw his soul.

29:22.416 --> 29:24.000
I loved him then, Ollie.

29:27.250 --> 29:28.416
I still do.

29:30.541 --> 29:32.791
But now he's just eat up by pain.

29:36.041 --> 29:39.250
Hey! I ain't hearing no screams.

29:50.000 --> 29:52.041
I thought
you should have this back.

29:52.625 --> 29:53.916
Have one more memory.

29:56.291 --> 29:57.958
Before I do what I gotta do.

30:03.583 --> 30:04.416
Thank you.

30:05.291 --> 30:06.875
Can I share it with you?

30:06.958 --> 30:11.541
My favorite memory
might push out some of your bad ones.

30:18.250 --> 30:19.791
The most perfect day.

30:20.625 --> 30:21.875
A snow day.

31:40.500 --> 31:44.791
Snow days are the best,
like a dream, but...

31:47.791 --> 31:52.041
eventually, snow melts,
and we gotta go back to the real world.

31:54.166 --> 31:56.125
But you still have memories.

31:56.750 --> 31:59.958
Snow days. Billy. Hugs.

32:03.041 --> 32:04.875
You know what it's like to be...

32:09.208 --> 32:10.541
I love you, Rosy.

32:15.458 --> 32:16.708
Thank you, Ollie.

32:29.500 --> 32:31.416
Back in the woods, you seen that sign?

32:32.166 --> 32:34.666
You said we were close,
but it wasn't on your map.

32:35.458 --> 32:36.458
Was it real?

32:56.416 --> 32:58.625
That sign leads to Billy's school.

32:59.708 --> 33:02.666
The black spot is school.

33:02.750 --> 33:04.416
Something happened there

33:04.916 --> 33:06.125
Something bad.

33:07.750 --> 33:09.583
We used to walk there and back.

33:10.291 --> 33:14.000
And if we're close to school,
that means we're close to home.

33:14.750 --> 33:15.791
So...

33:16.791 --> 33:17.916
we're almost home.

33:18.500 --> 33:19.916
We follow the map and...

33:21.333 --> 33:22.500
we're almost home.

33:37.166 --> 33:39.791
The best way past Zozo
is through the Tunnel of Love.

33:39.875 --> 33:40.958
I'll distract him.

33:41.625 --> 33:43.625
Once you're out,
find a way back to the creek

33:43.708 --> 33:46.083
and follow those memories back to Billy.

33:47.791 --> 33:49.583
Don't go getting all soft now.

33:50.416 --> 33:52.416
Old cactus-arm might change her mind.

33:53.000 --> 33:53.958
Well...

33:54.666 --> 33:57.750
you'd have to deal
with a rabid patchwork bunny.

34:05.625 --> 34:06.708
Nina.

34:15.250 --> 34:16.125
Zozo!

34:21.250 --> 34:23.333
All those years I searched for you.

34:24.375 --> 34:26.166
Traveled miles and miles.

34:27.458 --> 34:28.583
Gave up a lot.

34:30.833 --> 34:32.500
I didn't ask you to.

34:34.000 --> 34:36.500
It's okay, 'cause we're together again.

34:37.125 --> 34:38.708
That all means something.

34:41.625 --> 34:43.708
Nina's lost, but you don't have to be.

34:44.708 --> 34:46.291
Because I'm here with you.

34:47.875 --> 34:50.083
True friends. More than true friends.

34:51.791 --> 34:53.291
You could be my snow day.

34:54.916 --> 34:55.750
And me?

34:56.875 --> 34:57.875
I could be your...

35:01.500 --> 35:02.916
I love you, Zozo.

35:12.208 --> 35:13.666
Where's the bunny?

35:18.291 --> 35:19.916
He don't deserve more suffering.

35:20.833 --> 35:22.708
And we don't deserve any more either.

35:24.541 --> 35:27.791
I said, where's Ollie?

35:38.291 --> 35:40.291
There's something you don't see every day.

35:40.375 --> 35:42.750
You! You let him go!

35:43.333 --> 35:44.791
You've been distracting me.

35:44.875 --> 35:46.875
-Zozo, stop!
-Helping him escape!

35:46.958 --> 35:48.208
Zozo, I mean it--

36:03.416 --> 36:06.625
So, what now? You gonna rip me apart too?

36:09.333 --> 36:10.458
Nah.

36:11.000 --> 36:13.125
You ain't worth it.

36:19.750 --> 36:21.375
I'm coming, Billy!

36:21.458 --> 36:23.208
I'm coming home!

36:25.500 --> 36:29.041
Ollie!

36:34.625 --> 36:36.625
Bye-bye, Zozo!

36:36.708 --> 36:37.625
Hey!

37:19.916 --> 37:22.166
Hey! Hey, kid!

37:36.750 --> 37:39.333
I was trying to be nice!

37:39.416 --> 37:42.625
'Cause I was sort of
starting to like you a little!

37:43.291 --> 37:46.375
But now, I'm gonna make it hurt!

37:46.458 --> 37:47.833
Leave him alone, Zo.

37:56.291 --> 37:57.250
Get off of me!

37:58.208 --> 37:59.125
Get off!

37:59.500 --> 38:01.416
-I hate you!
-I don't care!

38:02.208 --> 38:03.916
I just need you to leave him be!

38:06.833 --> 38:08.000
Rosy!

38:09.875 --> 38:12.875
I wish I never brought you back to life!

38:12.958 --> 38:15.250
I wish you were still where I found you!

38:15.833 --> 38:18.250
Dead in the mud!

38:22.250 --> 38:23.791
No!
