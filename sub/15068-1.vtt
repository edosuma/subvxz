20:50.249 --> 20:51.206
She's alive.

20:52.120 --> 20:52.947
She's alive.

20:52.990 --> 20:53.817
Yes.

20:53.861 --> 20:54.557
Okay, come on, let's go.

20:54.601 --> 20:55.341
No, no, no, wait.

20:55.384 --> 20:56.907
One minute please.

20:56.951 --> 20:58.431
I can see her.

20:59.954 --> 21:02.261
She's, she's running.

21:02.304 --> 21:04.175
She's running fast.

21:04.219 --> 21:07.266
She's wearing a denim jacket.

21:07.309 --> 21:09.355
She's, she's upset.

21:09.398 --> 21:13.837
She's very angry, with you.

21:14.751 --> 21:15.491
Oh my god.

21:16.231 --> 21:17.319
You had a fight.

21:18.146 --> 21:19.582
It's why Lizzie's angry.

21:20.366 --> 21:21.845
Wait, I'm sorry.

21:22.933 --> 21:24.239
It's Elizabeth.

21:24.283 --> 21:25.893
She wants to be
called Elizabeth.

21:25.936 --> 21:26.894
How could you know that?

21:27.634 --> 21:28.591
Oh, I see.

21:30.158 --> 21:31.638
A necklace,

21:31.681 --> 21:34.510
a purple crystal pendant,
and it's special to her.

21:34.554 --> 21:35.598
Does that mean anything to you?

21:35.642 --> 21:36.904
Yes, yes, yes.

21:36.947 --> 21:38.122
It's an amethyst.

21:38.166 --> 21:39.863
I gave it to her for
her last birthday.

21:39.907 --> 21:41.169
I feel her breathing.

21:41.212 --> 21:42.866
I feel her heart beating,
it's very strong.

21:42.910 --> 21:45.042
She, she's scared
but she's alive.

21:45.086 --> 21:46.305
Where, where is she?

21:46.348 --> 21:47.306
I don't know yet.

21:47.349 --> 21:47.784
Okay, Ms. Holden.

21:47.828 --> 21:48.698
No, no.

21:48.742 --> 21:49.612
Okay, Ms. Holden, please.

21:49.656 --> 21:50.700
You've gotta come with me, okay?

21:59.709 --> 22:00.667
She's alive.

22:00.710 --> 22:01.624
What?

22:01.668 --> 22:02.712
She said, Lizzie's alive.

22:02.756 --> 22:03.626
That's amazing.

22:04.845 --> 22:05.889
She knew things about Lizzie,

22:05.933 --> 22:07.717
only things that I could know.

22:08.762 --> 22:10.546
She could feel her heart beat.

22:10.590 --> 22:13.027
Judy, can you hear yourself?

22:13.070 --> 22:14.594
Judith, this is BS.

22:14.637 --> 22:15.595
I don't even know
why we're wasting

22:15.638 --> 22:16.247
our time with her.

22:16.291 --> 22:17.161
Martin, stop.

22:17.205 --> 22:18.249
Judith, what else did she say?

22:18.293 --> 22:19.294
She knew about the necklace.

22:19.338 --> 22:20.861
The one that I
got her last year.

22:20.904 --> 22:23.037
She's exploiting our
daughter's kidnapping,

22:23.080 --> 22:23.994
can't you see that?

22:24.038 --> 22:25.692
She knew about our fight.

22:25.735 --> 22:27.824
She knew about being
called "Elizabeth."

22:27.868 --> 22:29.913
Martin, we have to believe her.

22:32.960 --> 22:33.700
We have to believe her, Martin.

22:33.743 --> 22:35.266
This is, come here.

22:35.310 --> 22:36.529
This is so good.

22:47.801 --> 22:48.932
Excuse us.

22:53.633 --> 22:54.416
What is it?

22:55.591 --> 22:56.636
The kid.

22:56.679 --> 22:58.115
The boyfriend, Liam Harrison.

22:58.159 --> 22:59.813
He is on a surfing
trip with his family,

22:59.856 --> 23:01.423
so that's a dead end.

23:01.467 --> 23:03.120
Anything on Ms. Spencer?

23:03.164 --> 23:04.513
Nada, she's clean.

23:04.557 --> 23:05.775
There's no arrest,
complaints, nothing.

23:07.777 --> 23:09.649
The psychic angle checks out.

23:09.692 --> 23:10.911
She has done this before.

23:10.954 --> 23:12.303
She even has a YouTube channel.

23:15.045 --> 23:16.133
What do you wanna do?

23:18.614 --> 23:20.224
Well, let's cut her loose.

23:20.268 --> 23:21.312
See how fast we can get a
warrant and search her house.

23:24.707 --> 23:25.882
She's okay.

23:26.666 --> 23:28.319
Okay, Ms. Spencer, that's it.

23:28.363 --> 23:29.538
Okay, I'm not going
to let you string

23:29.582 --> 23:30.496
along this family any longer.

23:30.539 --> 23:31.453
I'm not talking about Lizzie.

23:33.063 --> 23:35.849
Janine, she's okay.

23:37.546 --> 23:38.417
What?

23:41.594 --> 23:42.725
My wife?

23:45.424 --> 23:48.078
You need to tread
lightly, Ms. Spencer.

23:49.776 --> 23:52.431
She wants you to know
that the pain is gone.

23:54.171 --> 23:56.652
And she's grateful for all the
sacrifices you made for her.

23:57.784 --> 23:59.220
She knows that you
never left her side.

24:00.395 --> 24:01.309
You're a good man.

24:02.789 --> 24:04.051
And she's beautiful again.

24:04.791 --> 24:06.227
Just the way you remembered her.

24:07.184 --> 24:09.186
Not like in those
last few months.

24:11.319 --> 24:12.102
That's enough.

24:14.278 --> 24:17.499
She's showing me a piano.

24:17.543 --> 24:19.545
Does that mean anything to you?

24:21.198 --> 24:22.069
Yes.

24:23.810 --> 24:25.768
Sometimes spirits
show me something

24:25.812 --> 24:26.900
to help you understand
that they're

24:26.943 --> 24:28.249
coming forward.

24:30.730 --> 24:32.383
She loved that piano.

24:34.081 --> 24:35.865
Well she's glad
that you kept it.

24:37.606 --> 24:39.826
Even though you can't play.

24:41.871 --> 24:43.482
I'm taking lessons.

24:45.179 --> 24:46.136
She's laughing.

24:47.660 --> 24:50.532
Yeah, she says that you're
still not very good.

24:52.055 --> 24:53.448
But she's excited
that you're still

24:53.492 --> 24:55.450
tending to her
hydrangeas out front.

24:56.582 --> 24:57.974
She says they're as
beautiful as ever.

24:58.845 --> 25:00.237
Ms. Spencer, you're released.

25:00.281 --> 25:01.282
You're free to go.

25:02.326 --> 25:03.719
I'm not going anywhere.

25:04.415 --> 25:06.417
Look, you might have
some kind of a gift,

25:06.461 --> 25:08.376
but you are giving
this family false hope,

25:08.419 --> 25:11.510
and dragging them through
hell while you do it.

25:12.249 --> 25:14.164
Let's hear her out.

25:15.905 --> 25:19.343
These things about
Janine, she's really

25:19.387 --> 25:21.520
all we have at this
point, so there's no harm.

25:22.695 --> 25:26.437
You're in charge, FBI's
just here for support.

25:26.481 --> 25:28.048
Can we stop wasting time here

25:28.091 --> 25:29.789
and help this family?

25:30.529 --> 25:32.008
I just want to help find Lizzie.

25:33.967 --> 25:36.883
♪ ♪

25:45.674 --> 25:48.068
She was taken right here.

25:48.111 --> 25:50.157
Something was slowing
her breathing.

25:51.462 --> 25:55.989
She was, she was
drugged, confused.

25:56.729 --> 25:57.860
This is ridiculous.

25:57.904 --> 25:59.993
Mr. Holden, I've
been having these

26:00.036 --> 26:02.038
kind of visions since
I was seven years old.

26:02.082 --> 26:03.257
Can you tell me
why we're supposed

26:03.300 --> 26:04.606
to believe any of this stuff?

26:04.650 --> 26:05.825
I don't see the harm in letting

26:05.868 --> 26:07.348
her help the investigation.

26:07.391 --> 26:08.610
It looks like she's
holding up the investigation.

26:08.654 --> 26:10.612
All you're doing is
blocking the energy.

26:11.918 --> 26:12.962
We can't shut anyone out who

26:13.006 --> 26:14.050
might have any information.

26:14.094 --> 26:14.573
I agree.

26:14.616 --> 26:15.443
Fine.

26:16.879 --> 26:18.446
Oh, something's wrong.

26:19.273 --> 26:20.230
Something's wrong.

26:21.101 --> 26:22.276
What is it?

26:22.319 --> 26:24.887
Her foot, something
with her foot.

26:42.122 --> 26:43.514
My God it's Lizzie's shoe.

26:45.647 --> 26:47.606
How the hell did we miss this?

26:48.824 --> 26:49.999
Okay, get this to the station.

26:50.043 --> 26:50.957
I want it copied and marked.

26:51.000 --> 26:52.828
I want the test results ASAP.

26:54.917 --> 26:56.136
Now do you believe her, Martin?

27:07.364 --> 27:08.583
Well, there's nothing here.

27:09.236 --> 27:10.672
Thanks for your cooperation.

27:10.716 --> 27:12.500
Yeah, no problem.

27:12.543 --> 27:14.763
Now I can really
focus my energies

27:14.807 --> 27:16.199
on finding Lizzie.

27:16.809 --> 27:18.114
Thanks for the iced tea.

27:18.158 --> 27:20.900
Absolutely, I know
how hard you guys work.

27:22.684 --> 27:23.816
Okay, take care.

27:24.643 --> 27:25.426
Be safe.

27:53.759 --> 27:55.064
Hey, Mrs. McMillan.

27:55.108 --> 27:56.283
You stay right there.

27:56.326 --> 27:58.067
We'll get you fed
and up to bed soon.

28:13.474 --> 28:14.562
How is she?

28:14.605 --> 28:15.911
Oh, thank God you're here.

28:16.564 --> 28:17.739
Use some back-up.

28:19.088 --> 28:19.959
Come on.

28:21.395 --> 28:22.396
No.

28:26.313 --> 28:27.314
There you go.

28:27.357 --> 28:28.663
That wasn't so horrible.

28:32.058 --> 28:33.189
[Lizzie] It's disgusting.

28:33.973 --> 28:35.714
Well that wasn't
very nice, was it?

28:35.757 --> 28:36.671
Why should I be nice to you?

28:36.715 --> 28:37.759
Why did you kidnap me?

28:39.543 --> 28:41.458
Have another sip of
juice at least, alright?

28:41.502 --> 28:42.590
You must be thirsty.

28:45.114 --> 28:46.768
Don't think those masks
are gonna save you.

28:46.812 --> 28:48.335
I can hear your voices.

28:48.378 --> 28:50.206
I'm gonna nail you in
court with a voice ID.

28:50.250 --> 28:51.164
That's a thing.

28:51.207 --> 28:52.382
I'm gonna watch you fry, Whitey.

28:52.426 --> 28:54.210
Wow, that's harsh.

28:54.254 --> 28:56.735
Do you even know how
powerful my dad is?

28:56.778 --> 28:58.954
He's never gonna let
you get away with this.

29:00.303 --> 29:01.348
[Lizzie] Never.

29:03.437 --> 29:04.133
Never.

29:09.486 --> 29:10.836
I dosed her juice.

29:11.706 --> 29:12.228
Good.

29:21.585 --> 29:25.154
Baby, everything went perfectly.

29:25.198 --> 29:26.112
Oh yeah?

29:26.155 --> 29:28.201
Not up here, she's difficult.

29:28.244 --> 29:29.811
Why's she calling
you "Whitey?"

29:29.855 --> 29:31.813
I don't know, the
mask, it's white.

29:31.857 --> 29:33.815
Hey listen, Tracy, this sucks.

29:33.859 --> 29:35.643
Oh just hang in there, baby.

29:35.686 --> 29:37.427
How's it going with the old bat?

29:37.471 --> 29:39.038
Oh, you know.

29:39.081 --> 29:40.082
Same old, same old.

29:40.126 --> 29:41.388
Still catatonic.

29:41.431 --> 29:43.390
I gotta come back
at six and feed her,

29:43.433 --> 29:45.435
change her, and
then put her to bed.

29:45.479 --> 29:47.655
Oh, you're such a good
man Henry Spencer.

29:47.698 --> 29:49.091
Oh yeah, well.

29:49.135 --> 29:51.398
I can check on Lizzie
when I come back then too.

29:51.441 --> 29:53.966
But Tracy, seriously,
she is a humongous

29:54.009 --> 29:55.489
pain in the ass.

29:55.532 --> 29:58.361
Patience, I love patience.

30:09.155 --> 30:11.070
Chuck, I'm gonna
need you on this.

30:11.113 --> 30:12.549
Talkin' overtime, we're on again

30:12.593 --> 30:13.768
at the top of the 11 tonight.

30:13.812 --> 30:14.813
Great.

30:17.337 --> 30:18.555
Gale Chambers.

30:20.253 --> 30:21.123
What?

30:22.559 --> 30:23.212
No way.

30:24.170 --> 30:25.562
ANN?

30:28.870 --> 30:30.698
Yeah, of course I can
get to the psychic.

30:31.742 --> 30:33.179
I just broke Tracy's
story last week.

30:34.833 --> 30:35.790
No way.

30:37.052 --> 30:37.879
My God, the exclusive?

30:37.923 --> 30:38.749
Me?

30:39.359 --> 30:40.708
Yes, of course, of course.

30:40.751 --> 30:42.318
Just call me back.

30:42.362 --> 30:43.363
Thank you.

30:47.541 --> 30:50.370
Chuckie, you are looking
at the next big thing

30:50.413 --> 30:52.285
at American News Network.

30:52.328 --> 30:54.548
They want me to start reporting
on the Holden case ASAP.

30:54.591 --> 30:56.202
We're going national pal.

30:57.420 --> 30:59.553
Chuck, we're on at the
top of the 11 tonight,

30:59.596 --> 31:00.771
ANN tomorrow.

31:02.338 --> 31:03.862
This kid and that
psychic are gonna be my

31:03.905 --> 31:07.604
ticket to a brand new
desk at ANN, as an anchor.

31:08.344 --> 31:09.476
This is my time.

31:10.738 --> 31:11.870
I mean "our time."

31:13.610 --> 31:14.176
I mean, what the hell would
I do without you, Chuck?

31:15.221 --> 31:16.744
So pizza or burgers?

31:18.398 --> 31:19.965
We need to find
Tracy Spencer first.

31:20.574 --> 31:21.227
Right.

31:32.194 --> 31:34.631
I stol

31:34.675 --> 31:37.286
All eyes were on me,
it was such a rush.

31:40.159 --> 31:41.508
Yeah, they believed you?

31:41.551 --> 31:42.552
That's great.

31:42.596 --> 31:44.163
Yeah, they believed me.

31:44.206 --> 31:46.034
When I got that Detective
Williams in front of me

31:46.078 --> 31:47.818
and I told him his dead wife
was looking down on him,

31:47.862 --> 31:49.472
he was hooked!

31:49.516 --> 31:51.126
All that research
and surveillance

31:51.170 --> 31:52.823
you did on him really paid off.

31:54.086 --> 31:55.348
Oh, that piano story!

31:55.391 --> 31:57.785
Oh my God, that was so good.

31:57.828 --> 32:00.570
And the sneaker
thing, brilliant!

32:00.614 --> 32:03.051
You were brilliant, the
police, even Williams was like,

32:03.095 --> 32:04.879
"How did we miss that?"

32:04.923 --> 32:06.707
Oh, the jacket, did
you plant the jacket?

32:06.750 --> 32:07.490
Cause I'm gonna use
that in my reading.

32:07.534 --> 32:08.883
Yeah, yeah it's done.

32:08.927 --> 32:10.972
Hey, I can't believe the
police searched our house.

32:11.016 --> 32:12.408
That's pretty crazy, right?

32:12.452 --> 32:16.325
Yeah, but now we are in
the clear in their eyes.

32:16.369 --> 32:19.154
Baby, the framework
has been laid out.

32:19.198 --> 32:21.200
People already recognize
me from YouTube

32:21.243 --> 32:23.680
and now with the news
from that dog case,

32:23.724 --> 32:26.292
once again, genius on your part.

32:26.335 --> 32:27.684
Yeah, well, when I
saw her at the art show,

32:27.728 --> 32:28.903
it was pretty clear
that she would

32:28.947 --> 32:30.644
do anything for her
precious Rodrigo.

32:30.687 --> 32:32.385
Listen, Tracy, I'm just...

32:32.428 --> 32:34.387
What, our plan,
it's going perfectly.

32:34.430 --> 32:36.432
We watched that
house for a while,

32:36.476 --> 32:39.000
we grabbed Lizzie probably
at the perfect time.

32:39.044 --> 32:40.871
And her texts, there's so much

32:40.915 --> 32:42.786
good stuff for my visions.

32:42.830 --> 32:45.137
Oh, the best part,
forgot to tell you,

32:45.180 --> 32:46.616
you know that reporter
Gale Chambers,

32:46.660 --> 32:49.532
he came up to me at
the press conference.

32:49.576 --> 32:52.057
Our big break is so
close, I can taste it.

32:52.100 --> 32:54.015
Alright, well a lot
can still go wrong before

32:54.059 --> 32:56.887
all the fame and
fortune kicks in.

32:57.627 --> 33:00.108
Henry, Henry
don't be a buzzkill.

33:00.717 --> 33:02.545
I see the future, remember?

33:05.200 --> 33:06.419
Baby, come on.

33:06.462 --> 33:07.550
Don't worry, we're
gonna get that girl

33:07.594 --> 33:09.161
back to her parents
safe and sound.

33:09.204 --> 33:11.119
I will be deemed
a hero, and then

33:11.163 --> 33:14.253
we can ride that
wave to me getting

33:14.296 --> 33:16.037
my own TV show,
like Medium Marge.

33:16.081 --> 33:17.778
You know I love that show,
I can be just like her.

33:17.821 --> 33:19.649
Yeah, but she's a real medium.

33:19.693 --> 33:21.216
And she's fat.

33:21.260 --> 33:22.391
Yeah, well people believe what

33:22.435 --> 33:24.176
they want to believe, honey.

33:24.219 --> 33:25.699
Alright, that's all great.

33:25.742 --> 33:27.614
I just pray to God you're
right about everything,

33:27.657 --> 33:29.181
because that girl
over at old lady

33:29.224 --> 33:31.357
McMillan's house is
a pain in the ass.

33:32.271 --> 33:34.316
I know, just give
me a few more days.

33:35.274 --> 33:36.449
Need to drop a clue
here and there,

33:36.492 --> 33:38.668
string the police
along and make them

33:38.712 --> 33:40.888
believe I'm the only one
who can solve this case.

33:45.110 --> 33:46.633
I'm gonna be a star.

33:47.938 --> 33:51.246
And we're gonna get
everything we deserve.

33:53.770 --> 33:54.641
Oh, Henry look.

33:54.684 --> 33:55.642
Look, look, look.

33:58.253 --> 34:00.255
The press conference
was turned upside down

34:00.299 --> 34:02.431
by a surprise announcement
by Martin Holden

34:02.475 --> 34:05.956
of a two million dollar ransom,
that he himself will put up.

34:06.000 --> 34:07.567
Come on, get to me.

34:11.353 --> 34:13.790
I'm Tracy Spencer and
I know where Lizzie is.

34:14.661 --> 34:15.835
Your daughter's alive.

34:16.532 --> 34:17.228
Let me help you.

34:17.272 --> 34:18.099
Lizzie's alive.

34:19.969 --> 34:21.101
I look good.

34:21.972 --> 34:23.931
Everything's going so well.

34:23.974 --> 34:26.150
We're gonna get
everything that we want.

34:26.194 --> 34:28.630
Okay Tracy, I believe you.

34:44.647 --> 34:46.344
Put that down, please.

34:47.563 --> 34:49.435
Please, she made
that in pre-school.

34:50.175 --> 34:51.219
I can't replace it.

34:56.268 --> 34:57.225
Mrs. Holden.

35:00.098 --> 35:01.186
I'm sorry,

35:01.969 --> 35:03.318
but the faster we
rule out you and your

35:03.362 --> 35:04.711
ex-husband, the
sooner we can focus

35:04.754 --> 35:06.843
on the real suspects
and find your daughter.

35:06.887 --> 35:07.844
Of course.

35:09.150 --> 35:11.021
I know you're just
doing your job.

35:11.674 --> 35:13.198
The search team will
be out of here soon,

35:13.241 --> 35:13.937
and then you can
at least have some

35:13.981 --> 35:15.025
of your privacy back.

35:21.858 --> 35:22.598
Judith, hey.

35:23.469 --> 35:24.861
Hi.

35:25.732 --> 35:26.341
Hi.

35:30.258 --> 35:31.433
It's so surreal.

35:31.477 --> 35:32.391
I know, they're
doing the same thing

35:32.434 --> 35:33.783
at our house, I couldn't watch.

35:34.958 --> 35:37.004
Oh my God Judith,
how are you holding up?

35:37.613 --> 35:38.179
I'm not.

35:39.180 --> 35:41.313
I can't eat, I can't sleep.

35:42.401 --> 35:45.186
It's the not knowing
that's killing me.

35:45.230 --> 35:47.275
We have to hear something today.

35:47.319 --> 35:49.364
After the ransom
that Martin offered

35:49.408 --> 35:51.192
someone has got to pull forward.

35:51.236 --> 35:52.933
Unless she's gone.

35:55.370 --> 35:56.241
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

35:56.284 --> 35:57.024
I'm so sorry.

35:57.067 --> 35:58.286
It's okay, it's okay.

35:58.330 --> 36:00.854
It's just that you
can not say that.

36:00.897 --> 36:02.334
You can't say that.

36:02.812 --> 36:04.336
She needs to be alive.

36:04.379 --> 36:06.555
Okay, and we're
gonna get her back.

36:06.599 --> 36:07.165
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

36:07.208 --> 36:08.514
I didn't mean it.

36:08.557 --> 36:10.211
You know we really
need to pull it together

36:10.255 --> 36:10.820
for Lizzie.

36:10.864 --> 36:12.126
She's right.

36:14.911 --> 36:16.696
Volunteers are coming
tonight at eight.

36:16.739 --> 36:19.089
We have candles, we
have printed fliers,

36:19.133 --> 36:20.482
so we're ready to go.

36:20.526 --> 36:21.614
Rebecca, you are so amazing for

36:21.657 --> 36:23.137
putting this vigil on.

36:23.920 --> 36:26.401
Judith, I know
you're her mother but,

36:28.098 --> 36:31.189
I love Lizzie too, and I
just wanna bring her back.

36:32.015 --> 36:33.626
I know, I know.

36:38.283 --> 36:41.938
[R&B on the radio]

36:55.387 --> 36:56.301
Tracy.

36:57.432 --> 36:58.694
Gale Chambers.

36:58.738 --> 37:00.870
Hey, I was surprised
when you called.

37:00.914 --> 37:01.958
It's good to see
you again, Tracy.

37:02.002 --> 37:03.221
Likewise.

37:03.612 --> 37:05.484
So, how can I help you?

37:06.528 --> 37:07.747
Well you made quite a splash

37:07.790 --> 37:09.531
at that press
conference, well played.

37:10.793 --> 37:13.318
I just wanted to
help the Holden family.

37:13.361 --> 37:15.798
You know, you coulda
just made a phone call.

37:17.539 --> 37:18.932
I think we can help each other.

37:20.281 --> 37:21.674
Really, how's that?

37:22.849 --> 37:24.981
Do you want another news
story for Channel Eight?

37:27.027 --> 37:29.725
Tracy, I'm covering
the story for ANN now.

37:30.639 --> 37:31.553
This has gone national.

37:31.597 --> 37:32.772
Congratulations.

37:32.815 --> 37:34.295
No, all thanks to you.

37:34.339 --> 37:35.514
This Holden case is huge and

37:35.557 --> 37:37.080
you are smack in
the middle of it.

37:37.124 --> 37:38.256
I mean, come on.

37:38.299 --> 37:40.170
Psychic locates
wealthy man's child?

37:40.214 --> 37:41.259
This is top of the hour stuff.

37:42.390 --> 37:43.217
Think so?

37:43.261 --> 37:44.131
I know so.

37:45.350 --> 37:47.047
I would be very interested in

37:47.090 --> 37:49.745
doing a background
piece on you for ANN.

37:49.789 --> 37:51.399
I think our viewers
would be very interested

37:51.443 --> 37:52.661
in hearing your story.

37:54.446 --> 37:56.404
Really, story on me?

37:56.448 --> 37:57.884
Absolutely.

37:57.927 --> 37:59.451
The Holdens are very
important people.

37:59.494 --> 38:01.366
The media's gonna wanna
know all the details

38:01.409 --> 38:04.107
that go along with
a case like this.

38:04.151 --> 38:06.022
The investigation, who's
helping, who's hindering.

38:06.066 --> 38:07.720
All the drama that comes along

38:07.763 --> 38:09.765
with these emotionally
charged cases.

38:11.289 --> 38:13.639
So you're thinking
lots of coverage.

38:13.682 --> 38:15.423
It's guaranteed coverage.

38:16.772 --> 38:18.513
Excuse me, I'm sorry this
happens all the time.

38:18.557 --> 38:20.602
- Hey.
- Wow, Tracy Spencer?

38:20.646 --> 38:23.649
You're that psychic,
I saw you on the news.

38:23.692 --> 38:25.607
Yeah, yes I am.

38:25.651 --> 38:27.566
Do you know where that girl is?

38:27.609 --> 38:30.133
Uh no, not yet. But
I'm keeping myself

38:30.177 --> 38:31.787
open for messages.

38:31.831 --> 38:34.486
Well, I think what
you're doing is amazing.

38:34.529 --> 38:35.791
you're a hero.

38:35.835 --> 38:36.966
Thank you.

38:37.010 --> 38:38.098
Of course.

38:38.141 --> 38:39.229
Bye.

38:42.058 --> 38:44.887
Yeah, I think you may be right.

38:44.931 --> 38:47.020
This could be very
helpful in finding Lizzie.

38:47.063 --> 38:49.239
You know, fantastic
for the investigation.

38:49.283 --> 38:51.720
Of course, it's great
for the investigation.

38:52.417 --> 38:53.548
It's even better for us.

38:57.596 --> 38:59.772
Listen Tracy, I like you.

39:00.816 --> 39:01.948
So let me be blunt,

39:03.602 --> 39:05.995
this is turning out to be
a big, fat juicy story.

39:06.039 --> 39:07.910
The kind that can
catapult a career.

39:09.303 --> 39:11.000
Let me put a camera crew on you.

39:11.044 --> 39:12.741
I guarantee you will
get national coverage

39:12.785 --> 39:14.395
on this thing until it runs dry.

39:14.439 --> 39:16.005
You'll be a household name.

39:16.049 --> 39:18.617
You are the media
darling in this scenario.

39:19.574 --> 39:22.011
I mean, I just wanna
help the Holden family.

39:22.055 --> 39:23.273
You know, use my gift for good.

39:23.317 --> 39:24.623
Yes, exactly.

39:24.666 --> 39:26.538
I mean, have you seen
all those reality shows

39:26.581 --> 39:28.191
with the psychics
and the mediums?

39:28.235 --> 39:29.410
Yeah, of course I have.

39:29.454 --> 39:30.672
Like that one psychic
on Medium Marge.

39:30.716 --> 39:32.413
Yes, I love her.

39:32.457 --> 39:35.242
I could do that,
except I'm better.

39:35.285 --> 39:36.504
Of course you're better.

39:36.548 --> 39:37.766
You're younger, you're hotter,

39:37.810 --> 39:39.420
you're more, oh my God.

39:39.464 --> 39:41.727
You can do anything you
want, Tracy Spencer.

39:41.770 --> 39:43.163
Okay, let's just see what
we can do about this.

39:44.469 --> 39:45.295
Okay.

39:48.386 --> 39:49.648
Tracy Spencer.

39:52.302 --> 39:53.608
Psychic Savior.

39:53.652 --> 39:55.436
Psychic Savior, how
does that sound?

39:56.263 --> 39:58.308
Psychic Savior.

39:59.397 --> 40:00.615
I think I love it.

40:00.659 --> 40:01.573
Yeah?

40:01.616 --> 40:03.226
I mean, it's exactly who I am.

40:05.881 --> 40:07.274
And what do you get out of it?

40:08.231 --> 40:09.842
Just give me the exclusive.

40:09.885 --> 40:11.365
I get the head's up
next time you have

40:11.409 --> 40:13.367
one of your visions, before
you go to the police.

40:14.499 --> 40:16.501
And once you locate Lizzie,

40:16.544 --> 40:19.286
you're going to do a
live broadcast on ANN,

40:19.329 --> 40:23.072
leading police to her, and
reuniting her with her family.

40:23.508 --> 40:25.031
It'll be a ratings tsunami.

40:28.513 --> 40:29.688
You've got a deal.

40:31.907 --> 40:34.388
Alright, Ms. Spencer.

40:34.432 --> 40:35.998
Now one more thing,

40:36.042 --> 40:37.870
I'm going to need
you to wear this,

40:37.913 --> 40:40.220
whenever you're
around the Holdens.

40:40.263 --> 40:42.614
If I'm in range, I'll
pick up the conversation.

40:43.441 --> 40:45.399
So tell me, Ms. Spencer.

40:45.443 --> 40:47.836
Uh, call me Tracy.

40:47.880 --> 40:51.144
Tracy, have you ever worked
with the police before?

40:52.406 --> 40:54.364
No, I never have,
but I've always wanted

40:54.408 --> 40:56.671
to use my psychic gift for good.

40:56.715 --> 40:58.020
You know, to help people.

40:58.064 --> 41:00.719
Ever since I was
a young child, I

41:01.763 --> 41:03.112
I had lots of
visions, but I never

41:03.156 --> 41:04.418
understood what they meant.

41:14.646 --> 41:15.777
Mrs. Holden, hey.

41:15.821 --> 41:16.952
Did something happen?

41:16.996 --> 41:17.823
Are you okay?

41:18.388 --> 41:19.259
No developments, I just

41:21.217 --> 41:23.132
I found your website and
I had your address and

41:23.176 --> 41:25.265
I need to talk to you.

41:25.918 --> 41:27.267
Absolutely, yeah.

41:27.310 --> 41:28.921
I just feel like this
is all my fault and

41:33.055 --> 41:34.187
Can we go inside?

41:34.230 --> 41:35.362
I need to sit down.

41:36.058 --> 41:37.669
Yeah, sure.

41:38.539 --> 41:39.584
Can you just give me a second?

41:39.627 --> 41:40.628
My husband's at home sick and I

41:40.672 --> 41:42.456
just gotta get
him off the couch.

41:57.036 --> 41:57.863
[cy] Henry?

41:58.994 --> 42:00.213
Judith Holden is here.

42:00.256 --> 42:01.127
What? Why?

42:01.170 --> 42:02.258
She wants to come in and talk.

42:02.302 --> 42:03.564
This is insane, tell her no.

42:03.608 --> 42:05.261
It's too close.

42:05.305 --> 42:06.480
I can't do that, just go
next door and keep her quiet.

42:06.524 --> 42:07.437
We're gonna get caught.

42:07.481 --> 42:08.613
Oh my God.

42:08.656 --> 42:09.788
Will you just
get a grip, please?

42:09.831 --> 42:11.441
I will figure it out,
just go next door.

42:11.485 --> 42:13.269
I'll handle it, I'll text
you as soon as she's gone.

42:17.012 --> 42:18.100
You let yourself in.

42:19.449 --> 42:21.843
Sorry about that, come
in, please have a seat.

42:22.627 --> 42:23.845
I'm sorry that the
house is a mess.

42:23.889 --> 42:25.020
My husband's been sick.

42:25.064 --> 42:26.195
Oh Tracy, it's fine.

42:26.239 --> 42:28.502
I'm just here because

42:30.373 --> 42:31.984
I am so lost.

42:32.027 --> 42:34.421
It has been over 24 hours
since the press conference.

42:35.640 --> 42:37.337
Have you felt
anything from Lizzie?

42:38.947 --> 42:40.993
No, nothing yet, I'm sorry.

42:42.472 --> 42:45.258
Please, I need to know
that my baby is alive.

42:45.301 --> 42:46.215
Please.

42:49.175 --> 42:49.871
[Judith] Tracy?

42:53.092 --> 42:53.875
[Judith] Tracy?

42:58.750 --> 42:59.968
Listen you just need to
be still for a few more

43:00.012 --> 43:01.709
minutes and then I
can take the tape off.

43:01.753 --> 43:02.449
[muffled speaking]

43:02.492 --> 43:03.581
Be quiet.

43:11.197 --> 43:13.329
I'm not in control
of these things.

43:15.070 --> 43:16.071
I'm sorry.

43:16.115 --> 43:17.595
I'm just desperate.

43:18.117 --> 43:20.380
Here, this.

43:20.989 --> 43:22.600
This is Lizzie's, here.

43:23.426 --> 43:25.603
I heard that if you
have a personal item,

43:25.646 --> 43:26.908
it gives you a
better connection.

43:26.952 --> 43:28.170
You need to stop pushing me.

43:29.302 --> 43:31.130
It smells like her, please.

43:31.173 --> 43:32.392
Please take it.

43:33.828 --> 43:36.091
Listen, all this does,
is just block the energy.

43:36.135 --> 43:37.963
I can't be forced into anything.

43:38.703 --> 43:40.705
I have to be free, and
I have to feel open.

43:40.748 --> 43:44.056
I need to know that
my daughter is alright.

43:44.099 --> 43:46.362
You have to understand
that these visions,

43:46.406 --> 43:48.800
they take an
enormous toll on me.

43:48.843 --> 43:50.758
I, I am sorry, I didn't

43:50.802 --> 43:53.239
I know, I know, I
know you didn't mean it.

43:53.282 --> 43:54.327
It's okay.

43:54.370 --> 43:56.242
It's okay, we're gonna find her.

43:56.285 --> 43:57.417
I promise.

43:57.460 --> 43:58.940
You just have to trust me.

43:58.984 --> 44:01.334
I do, I do.

44:07.993 --> 44:08.863
[text noise]

44:20.005 --> 44:21.223
You scared me, Whitey.

44:22.007 --> 44:23.182
I'm sorry.

44:24.009 --> 44:24.879
I didn't mean to.

44:28.187 --> 44:29.449
Please don't cry.

44:31.625 --> 44:32.931
Are you gonna kill me, Whitey?

44:32.974 --> 44:35.237
No, no, I swear.

44:35.281 --> 44:36.717
You'll be home in a couple days.

44:38.066 --> 44:39.589
Doubt there'll be a
welcome home banner.

44:40.634 --> 44:41.722
Why would you say that?

44:41.766 --> 44:42.984
Your parents must love you.

44:43.942 --> 44:45.160
My mom's pissed at me.

44:46.814 --> 44:48.729
We got in this
huge fight before,

44:48.773 --> 44:51.906
you know, you took me.

44:53.865 --> 44:55.693
She practically threw
me out of the house.

44:55.736 --> 44:57.303
[laughter]

44:57.346 --> 44:59.871
I'm sorry, it's just, with you,

44:59.914 --> 45:01.394
I can kind of see
that happening.

45:03.788 --> 45:05.180
She doesn't trust me at all.

45:05.224 --> 45:06.225
She wouldn't even let
me go to this party

45:06.268 --> 45:07.400
all my friends are going to.

45:07.443 --> 45:08.923
I looked like such an idiot.

45:08.967 --> 45:10.272
Fifteen sucks.

45:10.316 --> 45:11.839
Believe me, I remember.

45:12.797 --> 45:14.407
Doesn't matter now.

45:14.450 --> 45:15.930
I missed the party anyways.

45:17.323 --> 45:19.325
Oh, sorry.

45:28.595 --> 45:29.901
What's goin on Haskell?

45:29.944 --> 45:30.945
You tell me.

45:32.033 --> 45:33.643
What?

45:33.687 --> 45:35.210
I just got off the phone
with the lawyers from ANN.

45:35.254 --> 45:36.821
When the hell were you
planning on telling me

45:36.864 --> 45:39.214
that you made a deal to run
the Holden story with them?

45:39.258 --> 45:41.956
Ah, I left a message with
the overnight producers.

45:42.000 --> 45:43.958
I figured I'd touch
base with you after.

45:44.002 --> 45:45.786
Come on, I had no idea
what they were talking about.

45:45.830 --> 45:47.440
I looked like an idiot.

45:47.483 --> 45:49.790
It's a huge story, it's a
slam dunk for the both of us.

45:49.834 --> 45:51.879
Sure, you get on
national television.

45:51.923 --> 45:53.402
I lose my best reporter,

45:53.446 --> 45:55.448
not exactly a win-win.

45:55.491 --> 45:57.058
ANN hasn't hired me yet.

45:57.102 --> 45:59.626
You must feel pretty
good about your chances.

45:59.669 --> 46:01.323
Otherwise you wouldn't
be screwing me.

46:01.367 --> 46:03.108
Well I wouldn't call
it, exactly screwing you.

46:03.151 --> 46:04.544
What would you call it?

46:04.587 --> 46:06.328
I'd call it me hustling
to get a story done.

46:06.372 --> 46:09.592
Well I'm glad I can fund
your audition for ANN.

46:09.636 --> 46:11.029
I told you I'm going places.

46:11.072 --> 46:12.552
When I become anchor at ANN,

46:12.595 --> 46:14.423
I'll be sure to put in
a good word for you.

46:14.467 --> 46:15.729
You never know.

46:15.773 --> 46:17.687
Maybe they're looking
for a good producer.

46:17.731 --> 46:20.429
I told you you had
big balls Chambers.

46:20.473 --> 46:21.953
You got an even bigger head.

46:21.996 --> 46:23.868
Correct me if
I'm wrong, but it's

46:23.911 --> 46:25.478
better to be number
one in the nation,

46:25.521 --> 46:26.609
than last in Los Angeles.

46:26.653 --> 46:28.046
You know what?

46:28.089 --> 46:29.787
Why don't I just yank
your story away from you?

46:29.830 --> 46:31.832
That way, I've ruined
your chances to do either.

46:31.876 --> 46:33.703
See that's your
problem, Haskell.

46:33.747 --> 46:36.141
You don't see the big picture.

46:36.184 --> 46:37.751
You mean your big picture.

46:37.795 --> 46:39.231
You wanna yank me
off the story, Haskell?

46:39.274 --> 46:40.449
Go ahead.

46:40.493 --> 46:41.842
Alright? Go ahead.

46:41.886 --> 46:43.496
I have the relationship
to Tracy Spencer.

46:43.539 --> 46:45.715
The psychic, I found her.

46:45.759 --> 46:47.761
And I am damn sure
ANN will give me

46:47.805 --> 46:49.981
all the man power,
and all the equipment

46:50.024 --> 46:51.504
I need to get
the story done anyway.

46:52.679 --> 46:53.854
And then what happens?

46:54.986 --> 46:56.552
Donovan Haskell is
out of the biggest

46:56.596 --> 46:58.163
story to come out
of Verno Beach.

46:58.206 --> 47:00.295
Alright, we'll do it your way.

47:00.339 --> 47:03.081
But you better hope that
job at ANN comes through

47:03.124 --> 47:04.734
because when this story's over,

47:04.778 --> 47:08.390
I'm gonna take great
pleasure in firing you.

47:09.957 --> 47:10.871
No you won't.

47:12.307 --> 47:13.743
Cause I'm the best you got.

47:13.787 --> 47:14.744
Try me.

47:18.096 --> 47:20.011
That guy's wound way too tight.

47:22.404 --> 47:25.625
[news theme]

47:32.850 --> 47:34.547
[Voiceover] ANN breaking news

47:34.590 --> 47:36.679
on the kidnapping
of Lizzie Holden.

47:37.289 --> 47:38.377
And for the
kidnappers, hear this.

47:38.420 --> 47:40.074
Listen to me, we
are prepared to pay

47:40.118 --> 47:42.250
two million dollars for
Lizzie's safe return.

47:42.294 --> 47:44.339
No questions asked.

47:44.383 --> 47:46.428
Please, we just need
to get Lizzie back.

47:46.472 --> 47:48.300
A shocking new development from

47:48.343 --> 47:50.084
psychic savior Tracy Spencer.

47:50.128 --> 47:51.738
Your daughter's alive.

47:51.781 --> 47:54.262
Let me help you, Lizzie's alive.

47:54.306 --> 47:55.611
[Voiceover] We go
now to Gale Chambers

47:55.655 --> 47:57.439
with an ANN exclusive.

47:57.483 --> 47:59.137
[Chambers] As we
await word on ransom

47:59.180 --> 48:01.748
or whereabouts of missing
teen, Lizzie Holden.

48:01.791 --> 48:04.316
In my exclusive interview
with psychic savior

48:04.359 --> 48:06.884
Tracy Spencer, she shares
her revelations about

48:08.581 --> 48:11.105
She certainly is getting
some coverage for herself.

48:12.802 --> 48:14.195
Kay, looks like the
guys are finishing up

48:14.239 --> 48:16.981
with the sound check for
the recording devices.

48:17.024 --> 48:19.331
They hook directly into
your phone, Mr. Holden.

48:19.374 --> 48:21.768
And uh, we're ready.

48:22.812 --> 48:24.466
Uh, now what?

48:24.510 --> 48:26.120
We wait.

48:26.164 --> 48:27.600
Why don't they call?

48:28.557 --> 48:29.558
Why is it taking so long?

48:29.602 --> 48:31.125
Is that normal?

48:31.169 --> 48:33.823
There's no normal in
child abduction cases.

48:33.867 --> 48:35.216
They'll call us
when they're ready.

48:35.260 --> 48:37.305
If this is a kidnapping.

48:37.349 --> 48:38.741
If this is a kidnapping?

48:38.785 --> 48:39.699
What else could it be?

48:41.440 --> 48:42.658
Realistically, we could
be dealing with a predator.

48:42.702 --> 48:45.226
Some type of sex trafficking.

48:45.270 --> 48:47.141
Agent Portman, please.

48:47.185 --> 48:48.969
I cannot even deal with that.

48:49.013 --> 48:51.885
Well given your
husband's, sorry,

48:51.929 --> 48:56.107
ex-husband's profile, most
likely it's kidnapping.

48:58.805 --> 49:00.415
Does anybody want anything?

49:00.459 --> 49:01.764
If we're going to
be here a while,

49:01.808 --> 49:03.157
I'll make us something to eat.

49:04.158 --> 49:06.073
Judith, you want
to give me a hand?

49:06.117 --> 49:07.074
Yeah, sure.

49:07.118 --> 49:08.467
I can use a break from here.

49:12.601 --> 49:13.472
Oh my God, Henry.

49:13.515 --> 49:14.995
Did you see that on ANN?

49:15.039 --> 49:16.997
You won't believe what
Gale Chambers called me.

49:17.041 --> 49:20.566
He said I am the psychic savior.

49:20.609 --> 49:22.394
That's right, I'm
the psychic savior.

49:22.437 --> 49:23.743
Isn't that great?

49:23.786 --> 49:25.092
Tracy, we need to give her back.

49:25.136 --> 49:27.355
I know, and we will.

49:29.401 --> 49:32.578
We will, but everything is
just so perfect right now.

49:32.621 --> 49:34.623
No Tracy, it's not perfect.

49:34.667 --> 49:36.147
This all needs to stop.

49:37.583 --> 49:38.976
What are you talking about?

49:39.019 --> 49:40.107
We're so close.

49:40.151 --> 49:41.630
No, I can't do
this to her, alright?

49:41.674 --> 49:43.241
She wants to go
home and her parents

49:43.284 --> 49:44.242
are freaking out.

49:44.285 --> 49:45.547
Don't wimp out on me, Henry.

49:46.853 --> 49:48.507
We've come too far
now to let it go.

49:49.290 --> 49:50.204
Come on, baby.

49:50.248 --> 49:51.597
Just think, they're gonna be so

49:51.640 --> 49:53.468
happy when we reunite them.

49:54.078 --> 49:55.427
Just a few more days.

49:55.470 --> 49:56.689
I can't, alright?

49:56.732 --> 49:58.038
It's too dangerous.

49:58.082 --> 49:59.518
Her life is in our hands.

49:59.561 --> 50:01.433
It's in my hands
and I can't do it.

50:01.476 --> 50:03.391
Baby, listen to me
we can handle this.

50:03.435 --> 50:04.697
No, you listen to me, alright?

50:04.740 --> 50:07.004
This was supposed to
be two days, 48 hours.

50:08.309 --> 50:09.310
Can't believe we thought
this was a good idea.

50:09.354 --> 50:10.616
This whole thing is crazy.

50:10.659 --> 50:12.226
Judith Holden was just
in our living room.

50:12.270 --> 50:13.836
And she didn't suspect anything.

50:13.880 --> 50:15.186
Tracy, if one detail goes wrong,

50:15.229 --> 50:16.622
then we go to jail.

50:16.665 --> 50:17.797
Or worse, Lizzie could get hurt.

50:17.840 --> 50:18.928
And I can't live with that.

50:18.972 --> 50:20.191
She didn't do anything
to deserve this.

50:20.234 --> 50:21.757
Henry, sit down.

50:21.801 --> 50:22.454
We need to talk about this.

50:22.497 --> 50:23.194
No, I can't sit.

50:23.237 --> 50:24.717
I can't do this anymore.

50:24.760 --> 50:26.849
How the hell did I even
let you talk me into this?

50:28.634 --> 50:30.027
I gotta get the hell outta here.

Stay calm and try to keep him

50:45.825 --> 50:47.087
on the line as long as possible.

50:47.957 --> 50:48.567
Okay.

50:52.179 --> 50:53.354
Hello, this is Martin Holden.

50:54.225 --> 50:56.314
[Altered Voice] I
know where Lizzie is.

50:56.357 --> 50:57.576
You have my
daughter, is she okay?

50:57.619 --> 50:59.795
[Altered Voice]
She's alive, for now.

51:00.231 --> 51:01.014
Where is she?

51:01.058 --> 51:01.884
Where is she?

51:01.928 --> 51:03.060
I want my little girl back.

51:03.103 --> 51:04.191
[Altered Voice]
You'll get her.

51:04.235 --> 51:06.019
As long as you do
what you're told.

51:06.889 --> 51:08.239
Okay, that's fine.

51:08.282 --> 51:09.762
That's fine, just name
it, anything, anything.

51:09.805 --> 51:11.938
Just please, don't hurt Lizzie.

51:13.461 --> 51:15.115
[Altered Voice]
Two million dollars.

51:15.159 --> 51:16.769
Put them in two
canvas duffle bags

51:16.812 --> 51:18.988
and bring them to the
Shore Cliffs mall.

51:20.120 --> 51:21.643
Leave them under the
edge of the fountain.

51:21.687 --> 51:24.472
Then go to the
pavilion and wait.

51:25.430 --> 51:27.084
Once I have the money secured,

51:27.127 --> 51:29.825
Lizzie will find you there.

51:31.175 --> 51:34.221

01:04:59.460 --> 01:05:02.072
and psychic savior
Tracy Spencer.

01:05:02.115 --> 01:05:04.291
ly on ANN.

01:05:04.335 --> 01:05:06.337
Good morning, Gale
Chambers for ANN.

01:05:06.380 --> 01:05:08.252
Thank you for joining us.

01:05:08.295 --> 01:05:10.863
We're here today, with
the Holden family.

01:05:10.907 --> 01:05:12.560
Who desperately
await news on the

01:05:12.604 --> 01:05:14.475
whereabouts of their
missing daughter, Lizzie.

01:05:15.694 --> 01:05:17.609
Now Mr. Holden, who do you think

01:05:17.652 --> 01:05:19.698
would be able to do
something like this?

01:05:20.177 --> 01:05:21.961
What kind of heartless monster

01:05:22.005 --> 01:05:23.615
would steal your
beautiful little girl?

01:05:23.658 --> 01:05:24.964
I don't know Gale.

01:05:25.008 --> 01:05:26.966
I think we're all just
hoping it's about money.

01:05:28.054 --> 01:05:29.708
So you think it's greed?

01:05:29.751 --> 01:05:32.102
Not anything more
heinous in nature?

01:05:32.145 --> 01:05:33.755
Nearly 20 percent
of teen abductions

01:05:33.799 --> 01:05:35.932
are likely sex
trafficking victims.

01:05:35.975 --> 01:05:39.022
We can't think of anybody
harming our little girl.

01:05:39.065 --> 01:05:39.892
It's,

01:05:41.981 --> 01:05:43.548
She must be so scared.

01:05:43.591 --> 01:05:45.202
You okay?

01:05:45.854 --> 01:05:47.160
[Lizzie] It stings.

01:05:47.204 --> 01:05:49.032
I'm really sorry, I
didn't mean to hurt you.

01:05:49.075 --> 01:05:50.294
You did.

01:05:50.337 --> 01:05:51.991
Yeah well, that
tray left a mark.

01:05:52.035 --> 01:05:53.732
Guess I'm sorry, too.

01:05:53.775 --> 01:05:54.863
We're even.

01:05:56.169 --> 01:05:57.562
You think it's broken?

01:05:57.605 --> 01:05:58.955
Yeah, maybe.

01:05:58.998 --> 01:06:00.826
This should help set
it, help stop the pain.

01:06:01.435 --> 01:06:03.481
Whitey, you really scared me.

01:06:03.524 --> 01:06:05.004
I know.

01:06:05.048 --> 01:06:06.658
I just want to go home.

01:06:06.701 --> 01:06:09.008
I know, soon.

01:06:09.052 --> 01:06:11.184
Hey, what do you say I
go fix a good breakfast?

01:06:12.577 --> 01:06:14.622
But thank God for the
FBI working in tandem

01:06:14.666 --> 01:06:17.451
with our psychic
savior, Tracy Spencer,

01:06:17.495 --> 01:06:19.540
who has shed so much
light on this case,

01:06:19.584 --> 01:06:22.891
and is indeed a guardian
angel for this entire family.

01:06:24.154 --> 01:06:25.764
Oh, I'm no angel.

01:06:25.807 --> 01:06:28.462
I'm just trying to do the
best I can for the Holdens.

01:06:29.028 --> 01:06:30.334
And for Lizzie.

01:06:30.377 --> 01:06:33.424
Tracy, tell us about
your psychic abilities.

01:06:33.467 --> 01:06:36.209
How it makes you feel to
channel these visions.

01:06:37.515 --> 01:06:39.125
Well, frankly

01:06:39.169 --> 01:06:42.955
the weight of the
visions is exhausting.

01:06:43.956 --> 01:06:45.392
It's a lot of responsibility.

01:06:46.089 --> 01:06:47.960
Yes, yes, absolutely.

01:06:48.004 --> 01:06:50.136
But with the dedicated
diligence of the FBI

01:06:50.180 --> 01:06:53.313
and your exceptional
powers, we are going to

01:06:53.357 --> 01:06:56.012
find Lizzie Holden, and
give these heartless

01:06:56.055 --> 01:06:58.492
perpetrators the
justice they deserve.

01:06:59.754 --> 01:07:01.408
I just want to thank
the Holden family,

01:07:01.452 --> 01:07:03.628
not only for their
courage, but for inviting

01:07:03.671 --> 01:07:05.108
us into their home.

01:07:05.934 --> 01:07:08.415
And Tracy Spencer, for her
gift and her insight.

01:07:09.982 --> 01:07:12.071
We'll have more on the story
this evening, live at 8 P.M.

01:07:12.115 --> 01:07:14.291
I'm Gale Chambers, ANN.

01:07:19.078 --> 01:07:22.255
Wow, that felt
great, really great.

01:07:23.561 --> 01:07:24.431
Alright, Chuck.

01:07:24.475 --> 01:07:25.302
What do you think?

01:07:25.345 --> 01:07:28.479
Oh, Tracy, are you alright?

01:07:28.522 --> 01:07:31.395
You were a little
"deer-in-the-headlights."

01:07:31.438 --> 01:07:33.397
Yeah, I just
think the pressure's

01:07:33.440 --> 01:07:35.268
starting to get to
me a little bit.

01:07:35.312 --> 01:07:36.791
Okay, well, you
better get over that,

01:07:36.835 --> 01:07:38.358
if we're gonna get you
that own show of yours.

01:07:38.402 --> 01:07:40.273
Psychic savior.

01:07:40.317 --> 01:07:41.318
Yeah, right.

01:07:58.422 --> 01:07:59.249
Hi.

01:08:00.076 --> 01:08:00.989
Jesus.

01:08:04.776 --> 01:08:06.125
How you doing, Tracy?

01:08:07.518 --> 01:08:09.868
Just checking on you, you
seem a little skittish.

01:08:09.911 --> 01:08:12.262
Yeah well, I guess
it's stage fright.

01:08:12.305 --> 01:08:14.002
Ugh, get over it.

01:08:15.526 --> 01:08:17.658
Come on, it's been
pretty smooth so far.

01:08:17.702 --> 01:08:19.095
Foolproof.

01:08:20.183 --> 01:08:23.099
You as the, what is it?

01:08:23.142 --> 01:08:25.536
Psychic savior?

01:08:26.102 --> 01:08:27.929
Or savior psychic?

01:08:29.408 --> 01:08:32.760
And me as the doting,
loving step-mother.

01:08:32.804 --> 01:08:35.981
Oh God.

01:08:38.113 --> 01:08:39.810
I have been way too
nice for way too long.

01:08:39.854 --> 01:08:41.856
I deserve a vacation.

01:08:41.899 --> 01:08:44.685
Listen Rebecca, I
can keep this going

01:08:44.729 --> 01:08:46.513
for another 24 hours,
but you've gotta

01:08:46.557 --> 01:08:48.341
demand that ransom money.

01:08:48.385 --> 01:08:50.082
That way we can Lizzie
home to her Mom,

01:08:50.126 --> 01:08:52.475
you can get your money, and
I'll have my new career.

01:08:52.519 --> 01:08:54.520
That was the plan.

01:08:54.564 --> 01:08:56.044
Change of plans.

01:08:56.087 --> 01:08:57.568
What are you talking about?

01:08:57.611 --> 01:08:59.526
Well actually, it's
not really a change.

01:08:59.569 --> 01:09:01.267
It's been my plan
the whole time.

01:09:02.834 --> 01:09:04.095
You have to get rid of her.

01:09:05.618 --> 01:09:07.099
What do you mean,
"get rid of her?"

01:09:07.839 --> 01:09:08.796
Lizzie has to die.

01:09:11.756 --> 01:09:14.627
No, you said you
wanted ransom money.

01:09:14.671 --> 01:09:17.153
Oh wake up, Tracy.

01:09:17.196 --> 01:09:19.198
Lizzie's not going home.

01:09:19.242 --> 01:09:21.809
She's not going anywhere, ever.

01:09:22.549 --> 01:09:25.029
There's no way, I can't do that.

01:09:26.249 --> 01:09:28.076
For a psychic, I'm surprised

01:09:28.120 --> 01:09:29.426
you didn't see this one coming.

01:09:31.515 --> 01:09:34.126
You know, when I
found you on YouTube,

01:09:34.170 --> 01:09:35.997
you seemed so much smarter.

01:09:36.041 --> 01:09:38.304
Look, I know I've
done some bad things

01:09:38.348 --> 01:09:40.915
in my life, but murder
will not be one of them.

01:09:41.698 --> 01:09:42.700
Yes it will.

01:09:43.483 --> 01:09:44.788
Besides, you have no choice.

01:09:44.832 --> 01:09:47.225
If Lizzie lives,
they'll catch you.

01:09:47.270 --> 01:09:49.620
She'll ruin your life,
and you'll go to jail.

01:09:49.662 --> 01:09:50.795
And I'm pretty
certain they don't

01:09:50.837 --> 01:09:52.578
give TV shows to inmates.

01:09:54.015 --> 01:09:55.582
Listen to me, I have been
good to that little brat

01:09:55.626 --> 01:09:58.194
for four years, and that measly
little two million dolllar

01:09:58.237 --> 01:10:00.718
ransom isn't nearly enough
for all my hard work.

01:10:02.589 --> 01:10:04.809
Do you have any idea how much
my husband is even worth?

01:10:06.114 --> 01:10:08.987
And that will gives it all
to his precious little bitch.

01:10:10.423 --> 01:10:12.425
Lizzie is the only
thing standing between

01:10:12.469 --> 01:10:14.645
me and Martin's
many, many millions.

01:10:15.689 --> 01:10:17.038
So you want me to kill her?

01:10:20.346 --> 01:10:21.956
I knew you'd see it my way.

01:10:23.654 --> 01:10:25.177
Now let's get this done.

01:10:26.091 --> 01:10:26.744
Tonight.

01:10:35.709 --> 01:10:36.971
How did we get here?

01:10:37.711 --> 01:10:39.147
How did this get
so out of control?

01:10:40.148 --> 01:10:40.975
We got greedy.

01:10:42.673 --> 01:10:44.240
Stopped being who we really
are, and we got greedy.

01:10:45.719 --> 01:10:48.244
I mean, we were
supposed to just babysit

01:10:48.287 --> 01:10:50.724
Lizzie for a few days
and Rebecca would get

01:10:50.768 --> 01:10:52.726
her husband's money, I
would get some notoriety,

01:10:52.770 --> 01:10:54.641
and that's all that
was supposed to happen.

01:10:54.685 --> 01:10:56.469
No one was supposed
to get hurt, remember?

01:10:56.513 --> 01:10:58.341
Someone always gets hurt.

01:10:59.167 --> 01:11:01.474
We can't do what Rebecca says.

01:11:02.867 --> 01:11:04.390
We're not murderers, Tracy.

01:11:05.348 --> 01:11:06.610
We're not, right?

01:11:07.915 --> 01:11:09.177
Jesus.

01:11:10.091 --> 01:11:11.179
We're gonna get caught.

01:11:11.223 --> 01:11:12.224
No, Henry.

01:11:12.268 --> 01:11:13.617
I can't go to prison.

01:11:14.270 --> 01:11:16.446
I mean we can't, we worked
way too hard for this.

01:11:16.489 --> 01:11:18.578
This is not how it ends, no way.

01:11:20.014 --> 01:11:21.842
You know what, baby?

01:11:23.148 --> 01:11:24.497
We don't have a choice.

01:11:24.541 --> 01:11:26.194
We have to do what Rebecca says.

01:11:28.196 --> 01:11:29.023
What?

01:11:29.067 --> 01:11:29.720
Tracy, no.

01:11:29.763 --> 01:11:31.417
I'm not a killer.

01:11:31.461 --> 01:11:32.679
I know that.

01:11:32.723 --> 01:11:34.072
But we don't have a choice here.

01:11:36.117 --> 01:11:37.162
You do it.

01:11:37.205 --> 01:11:39.512
She likes you, she trusts you.

01:11:40.339 --> 01:11:42.646
I don't know, just
make her go to sleep.

01:11:42.689 --> 01:11:44.038
She won't suffer.

01:11:45.257 --> 01:11:47.477
It'll be over, but
you have to do it.

01:11:47.520 --> 01:11:49.609
Please Tracy, no.

01:11:49.653 --> 01:11:51.655
And then, I'll tell you
where to leave the body.

01:11:52.960 --> 01:11:54.440
Oh my God.

01:11:54.484 --> 01:11:56.616
And I'll just, I'll tell
the police where she is

01:11:56.660 --> 01:11:59.315
and it'll be all
over, I promise.

01:12:00.403 --> 01:12:01.795
They're still gonna
look for the kidnappers,

01:12:01.839 --> 01:12:03.231
the murderers.

01:12:04.711 --> 01:12:06.060
Let me handle that.

01:12:06.844 --> 01:12:07.584
I'll handle it.

01:12:23.643 --> 01:12:24.427
Hey.

01:12:25.645 --> 01:12:26.385
Hey.

01:12:28.300 --> 01:12:29.083
How you holdin' up?

01:12:30.868 --> 01:12:32.217
Just trying to be strong.

01:12:33.436 --> 01:12:35.438
You know you don't have
to shoulder this alone.

01:12:35.481 --> 01:12:37.483
I'm here for you.

01:12:37.527 --> 01:12:39.137
I know.

01:12:39.964 --> 01:12:40.704
You have been.

01:12:42.009 --> 01:12:42.880
You've been great.

01:12:44.272 --> 01:12:45.448
We made a great team once.

01:12:47.711 --> 01:12:48.538
We did.

01:12:49.887 --> 01:12:51.367
Remind me again why we broke up.

01:12:52.368 --> 01:12:53.194
I threw you out.

01:12:54.805 --> 01:12:56.067
You slept with your assistant.

01:12:57.329 --> 01:12:57.808
Yeah.

01:12:59.331 --> 01:13:01.420
You ready to do the
Live at Eight exclusive?

01:13:02.769 --> 01:13:04.118
I have to be.

01:13:05.642 --> 01:13:07.339
We have to do this, Martin.

01:13:08.209 --> 01:13:09.297
Detective Williams
says the more we

01:13:09.341 --> 01:13:11.256
talk about her on
TV, the more the

01:13:11.299 --> 01:13:13.911
kidnapper views her
as a real person.

01:13:15.434 --> 01:13:17.828
The better the chances are we
have to get her home safely.

01:13:19.133 --> 01:13:21.788
I'm so scared of screwing it up.

01:13:21.832 --> 01:13:23.268
You're not screwing
it up, you're not.

01:13:23.311 --> 01:13:23.921
Come here.

01:13:26.576 --> 01:13:28.273
We're gonna do
this together, Bug.

01:13:29.361 --> 01:13:31.102
You haven't called
me that in ages.

01:13:33.234 --> 01:13:34.279
It's kinda nice.

01:14:00.131 --> 01:14:01.437
Okay, alright.

01:14:02.350 --> 01:14:04.352
Let's do this, let's do this.

01:14:16.539 --> 01:14:18.802
Come on, come on.

01:14:26.549 --> 01:14:27.506
Damnit.

01:14:32.946 --> 01:14:34.165
It's time.

01:14:34.208 --> 01:14:35.253
It's time?

01:14:35.296 --> 01:14:36.167
Yeah.

01:14:36.907 --> 01:14:37.908
I can't believe it.

01:14:37.951 --> 01:14:38.996
Thank you, Whitey.

01:14:40.258 --> 01:14:41.825
What are you, what
are you doing?

01:14:41.868 --> 01:14:43.217
Whitey, no, no,
no, please don't.

01:14:43.261 --> 01:14:43.870
Please

01:14:43.914 --> 01:14:45.350
[muffled screams]

01:14:50.181 --> 01:14:51.008
Excuse me.

01:14:55.534 --> 01:14:56.361
Tracy?

01:14:56.404 --> 01:14:57.797
Get me something good.

01:14:57.841 --> 01:14:59.407
I know where Lizzie is.

01:14:59.451 --> 01:15:01.192
I'm at the police station,
I'm gonna take them to her.

01:15:01.235 --> 01:15:03.455
Okay, the police station?

01:15:03.499 --> 01:15:05.283
Give me five
minutes, I'm sending

01:15:05.326 --> 01:15:07.154
a van to you right now.

01:15:07.198 --> 01:15:10.854
We find Lizzie live, on
the broadcast, primetime.

01:15:12.072 --> 01:15:14.422
Tracy Spencer this
is going to be...

01:15:20.341 --> 01:15:22.605
Okay, we are on in five.

01:15:24.302 --> 01:15:25.303
Where's Judith?

01:15:25.695 --> 01:15:27.000
She went to talk to you.

01:15:28.959 --> 01:15:30.221
Where the hell is Judith?

01:15:44.409 --> 01:15:46.498
Hey, you ready?

01:15:46.542 --> 01:15:47.586
Uh, just give me a minute.

01:16:04.690 --> 01:16:06.083
Hey, Chuck.

01:16:06.126 --> 01:16:07.780
I've gotta get
Detective Williams

01:16:07.824 --> 01:16:08.476
but is your camera ready?

01:16:08.520 --> 01:16:10.087
Yeah.

01:16:10.130 --> 01:16:10.914
Cause I'm gonna lead you
and the police to Lizzie.

01:16:10.957 --> 01:16:12.089
Alright.

01:16:13.351 --> 01:16:14.439
Judith.

01:16:15.005 --> 01:16:16.006
I'm going with you.

01:16:16.049 --> 01:16:17.137
How did you know I was here?

01:16:17.181 --> 01:16:17.964
I heard you on
the phone with Gale.

01:16:18.008 --> 01:16:19.270
Why didn't you tell me?

01:16:19.313 --> 01:16:20.837
I'm sorry, he forced
me to do this live.

01:16:20.880 --> 01:16:22.578
Tracy, I don't care.

01:16:22.621 --> 01:16:23.883
Just take me to Lizzie.

01:16:23.927 --> 01:16:25.624
No, this could be
really dangerous, no.

01:16:25.668 --> 01:16:27.670
It's not up for discussion.

01:16:27.713 --> 01:16:29.280
I am going with you.

01:16:30.063 --> 01:16:30.586
Now.

01:16:30.629 --> 01:16:31.978
Okay, fine.

01:16:35.112 --> 01:16:36.809
When Lizzie was born, it was

01:16:42.336 --> 01:16:45.078
I can't even begin to explain
how profound that day was.

01:16:45.122 --> 01:16:47.690
It changed me.

01:16:51.128 --> 01:16:55.828
Lizzie's sassy and stubborn
and brilliant and funny.

01:16:57.917 --> 01:17:02.618
That kid is my hero and her
not being here has broken me.

01:17:05.795 --> 01:17:08.014
And Rebecca, Stepmom.

01:17:09.059 --> 01:17:10.451
What is Lizzie to you?

01:17:11.365 --> 01:17:13.280
You know, I never
thought I'd be a mom.

01:17:14.412 --> 01:17:16.196
And I can never be her mom.

01:17:17.850 --> 01:17:20.679
But Lizzie is a gift in my life.

01:17:23.073 --> 01:17:25.075
We've just become
such good friends.

01:17:25.815 --> 01:17:26.729
More like sisters.

01:17:27.730 --> 01:17:29.253
Excuse me Mrs. Holden.

01:17:30.558 --> 01:17:32.212
I'm just getting this in now.

01:17:32.256 --> 01:17:33.823
Our psychic savior,
Tracy Spencer

01:17:33.866 --> 01:17:35.999
is at this very
moment, leading police

01:17:36.042 --> 01:17:37.696
to your daughter, Lizzie Holden.

01:17:37.740 --> 01:17:38.784
Folks, this is incredible stuff.

01:17:38.828 --> 01:17:40.177
Where are they?

01:17:40.220 --> 01:17:40.917
Where is she?

01:17:40.960 --> 01:17:42.048
Is she dead?

01:17:42.092 --> 01:17:43.006
We don't have those details yet,

01:17:43.049 --> 01:17:44.137
but we are going to join Tracy,

01:17:44.181 --> 01:17:45.835
as she leads police
to your daughter

01:17:45.878 --> 01:17:47.271
at this very moment.

01:17:48.054 --> 01:17:50.100
Okay, I have Tracy on right now.

01:17:50.143 --> 01:17:51.797
Tracy, can you hear me?

01:17:51.841 --> 01:17:53.320
Yes, Gale.

01:17:53.364 --> 01:17:54.757
Great, can you give
us your location?

01:17:54.800 --> 01:17:57.716
We're on Shore Cliffs
Drive and I'm just

01:17:57.760 --> 01:17:59.762
focusing my energy
on finding Lizzie.

01:17:59.805 --> 01:18:01.981
Okay, and Tracy are you alone?

01:18:02.025 --> 01:18:03.635
Are you by yourself,
who are you with?

01:18:03.679 --> 01:18:05.245
I'm here with Judith Holden,

01:18:05.289 --> 01:18:06.420
and I'm taking her to Lizzie.

01:18:06.464 --> 01:18:07.639
You're here with Judith Holden.

01:18:07.683 --> 01:18:09.293
Judith?

01:18:09.336 --> 01:18:11.425
We're getting
close, I can feel it.

01:18:11.469 --> 01:18:12.731
We're close, you can feel her?

01:18:12.775 --> 01:18:13.732
Yes, we are.

01:18:14.341 --> 01:18:15.734
What is going on?

01:18:15.778 --> 01:18:17.736
Tell me what's going on,
tell me what's going on.

01:18:17.780 --> 01:18:18.955
Just a moment,
please Mr. Holden.

01:18:19.651 --> 01:18:21.000
I can feel her breathing.

01:18:21.044 --> 01:18:22.915
Oh, she's alive,
she's breathing.

01:18:22.959 --> 01:18:24.787
I can feel her breathing,
yes, getting stronger.

01:18:24.830 --> 01:18:25.744
I feel her heart.

01:18:27.137 --> 01:18:28.573
[Judith] Is it
okay, is she okay?

01:18:33.970 --> 01:18:35.362
What? Tracy?

01:18:35.406 --> 01:18:36.146
Mommy.

01:18:36.189 --> 01:18:37.190
Oh my God.

01:18:37.234 --> 01:18:38.322
Mommy, I can't breathe.

01:18:38.365 --> 01:18:39.105
No, no, no, no, no.

01:18:40.411 --> 01:18:41.325
What's going on.

01:18:41.368 --> 01:18:42.761
Okay, Tracy just stay with me.

01:18:42.805 --> 01:18:44.763
Can you just tell me,
whereabouts are you exactly?

01:18:44.807 --> 01:18:47.070
[coughing]

01:18:47.113 --> 01:18:48.724
Oh my God, somebody
do something.

01:18:49.594 --> 01:18:50.769
Oh my God, we've
gotta get there.

01:18:53.206 --> 01:18:54.425
Tracy!

01:18:56.122 --> 01:18:57.515
Is she alive, is she alive?

01:18:57.558 --> 01:18:58.951
I think I know where
she is but we've gotta go.

01:18:59.778 --> 01:19:00.736
Please tell me what's going on.

01:19:00.779 --> 01:19:01.693
What is going on?

01:19:01.737 --> 01:19:02.607
What happened?

01:19:02.650 --> 01:19:04.000
Make a left on Ocean View.

01:19:04.043 --> 01:19:05.436
Ocean View Drive?

01:19:06.002 --> 01:19:07.612
Ocean View Drive,
that's where we live.

01:19:07.655 --> 01:19:08.439
Yeah, I know.

01:19:08.482 --> 01:19:09.309
What the hell is going on.

01:19:09.353 --> 01:19:12.399
Uh, 1222 Ocean View Drive.

01:19:14.750 --> 01:19:16.752
1222 Ocean View Drive?

01:19:16.795 --> 01:19:17.883
Tracy are you sure?

01:19:18.579 --> 01:19:19.842
Yes, I'm sure.

01:19:19.885 --> 01:19:21.104
That's our house,
that's where we live.

01:19:21.147 --> 01:19:22.279
Why are they going to our house?

01:19:22.322 --> 01:19:23.454
What the hell is going on?

01:19:27.066 --> 01:19:28.154
In the trunk, check it.

01:19:28.198 --> 01:19:28.894
Oh my God.

01:19:28.938 --> 01:19:29.721
Check the trunk.

01:19:31.375 --> 01:19:32.463
Okay Tracy, to clarify,
you believe that Lizzie

01:19:32.506 --> 01:19:35.031
is in the back of
a brown Infinity.

01:19:35.074 --> 01:19:37.860
A brown Infinity,
but that's your car.

01:19:39.252 --> 01:19:42.081
Yeah I know, but
that's impossible.

01:19:43.343 --> 01:19:44.823
Rebecca Holden is that your car?

01:19:58.097 --> 01:19:59.838
Open it, somebody open it.

01:19:59.882 --> 01:20:01.535
Detective Williams,
we need help.

01:20:01.579 --> 01:20:03.711
Somebody we need help, open it.

01:20:03.755 --> 01:20:06.540
Mommy's here, mommy's here.

01:20:07.367 --> 01:20:08.281
Okay, open it.

01:20:08.325 --> 01:20:09.500
Oh my God.

01:20:09.543 --> 01:20:12.503
Oh God, no, no, no, no, no.

01:20:12.546 --> 01:20:14.331
Oh my God, she's dead.

01:20:14.374 --> 01:20:16.159
Lizzie, it's Mommy, it's Mommy.

01:20:16.202 --> 01:20:18.465
Please baby, please Lizzie baby.

01:20:18.509 --> 01:20:20.467
Oh God, she's alive.

01:20:21.773 --> 01:20:22.861
What?

01:20:22.905 --> 01:20:24.515
I think she's alive.

01:20:24.558 --> 01:20:25.908
She's breathing.

01:20:25.951 --> 01:20:27.866
She's alive.

01:20:27.910 --> 01:20:29.172
Oh God.

01:20:31.391 --> 01:20:32.262
Tracy.

01:20:35.743 --> 01:20:37.702
Oh, oh wow.

01:20:37.745 --> 01:20:39.095
[Chambers] At this
very moment Lizzie's

01:20:39.138 --> 01:20:41.140
being pulled from the
trunk of your car.

01:20:41.184 --> 01:20:42.533
How is that even possible?

01:20:42.576 --> 01:20:43.621
I don't understand.

01:20:43.664 --> 01:20:44.796
Did you have anything to do with

01:20:44.840 --> 01:20:46.754
the kidnapping of Lizzie Holden?

01:20:46.798 --> 01:20:48.321
No.

01:20:48.365 --> 01:20:49.975
Did you have anything to do with

01:20:50.019 --> 01:20:52.195
the kidnapping of Lizzie Holden?

01:20:53.370 --> 01:20:54.545
Mrs. Holden?

01:20:54.980 --> 01:20:56.503
Do you have any answers?

01:20:57.940 --> 01:20:59.289
You know what?

01:20:59.332 --> 01:21:00.116
I don't have to answer
any of your questions

01:21:00.159 --> 01:21:01.508
without a lawyer present.

01:21:07.558 --> 01:21:09.560
Folks, this has been a
shocking turn of events.

01:21:10.387 --> 01:21:13.607
Our pyschic savior has
found Lizzie Holden, alive.

01:21:14.304 --> 01:21:16.741
And now stepmother,
Rebecca Holden,

01:21:16.784 --> 01:21:18.612
may have something to
do with the kidnapping.

01:21:19.918 --> 01:21:21.877
Let's go to the
emotional family reunion.

01:21:24.488 --> 01:21:26.403
[Female Crew Member]
And Gale, you're out.

01:21:28.971 --> 01:21:30.102
Booyah!

01:21:30.146 --> 01:21:31.060
Goodnight.

01:21:31.103 --> 01:21:32.365
Chambers out.

01:21:35.368 --> 01:21:37.066
Jerry, listen to me.

01:21:37.109 --> 01:21:39.285
I need to be gone tonight.

01:21:39.982 --> 01:21:41.244
How much can I take with me?

01:21:43.028 --> 01:21:44.812
No, I mean, how
much can I cash out?

01:21:44.856 --> 01:21:46.553
[violent crashing]

01:21:53.647 --> 01:21:54.213
Tracy.

01:21:54.257 --> 01:21:55.475
Jesus, Henry.

01:21:55.998 --> 01:21:57.086
What did you do?

01:21:57.129 --> 01:21:57.825
The right thing.

01:21:57.869 --> 01:21:59.871
Lizzie, Lizzie!

01:22:03.092 --> 01:22:04.658
I thought I was never
going to see you agian.

01:22:04.702 --> 01:22:06.356
No, you ruined our
lives, our only hope

01:22:06.399 --> 01:22:08.749
is that little bitch not
being able to identify us.

01:22:08.793 --> 01:22:09.881
I'm not a murderer, Tracy.

01:22:09.925 --> 01:22:11.535
I couldn't kill her.

01:22:11.578 --> 01:22:13.929
You think Rebecca's not
gonna point her finger at us?

01:22:13.972 --> 01:22:16.105
She's not gonna stop, Tracy.

01:22:16.148 --> 01:22:17.410
If Rebecca didn't
get rid of Lizzie now,

01:22:17.454 --> 01:22:18.716
she'd find another way, alright?

01:22:18.759 --> 01:22:19.760
I had to expose her.

01:22:19.804 --> 01:22:21.197
You exposed us.

01:22:21.240 --> 01:22:23.982
Excuse me, I am
sorry about this.

01:22:24.026 --> 01:22:25.201
Tracy, I just have to tell you,

01:22:25.244 --> 01:22:26.985
the gift you have been
given is incredible.

01:22:28.944 --> 01:22:31.337
[Radio Dispatch] Williams,
Rebecca Holden is deceased.

01:22:31.381 --> 01:22:33.339
She just got tagged
by a squad car.

01:22:34.732 --> 01:22:35.689
You gotta be kidding me.

01:22:35.733 --> 01:22:37.604
Go for Williams, I need detail.

01:22:37.648 --> 01:22:39.432
I'm sorry, I have to take this.

01:22:41.260 --> 01:22:42.566
[Tracy] Oh my God.

01:22:42.609 --> 01:22:44.220
Jesus, Henry, do you
know what this means?

01:22:44.872 --> 01:22:45.699
We got away with it.

01:22:45.743 --> 01:22:46.526
Tracy.

01:22:46.570 --> 01:22:47.701
No seriously, baby.

01:22:47.745 --> 01:22:49.051
We can have everything we want,

01:22:49.094 --> 01:22:50.487
we can have our dreams,
I can have my TV show.

01:22:50.530 --> 01:22:52.489
Tracy, stop.

01:22:52.532 --> 01:22:53.707
We will never be free.

01:22:53.751 --> 01:22:54.970
This will never be clean.

01:22:56.058 --> 01:22:57.363
Henry, listen to me.

01:22:57.407 --> 01:22:58.451
I'm gonna take care of it.

01:22:58.495 --> 01:22:59.670
I'm gonna handle
it, I promise you.

01:23:05.023 --> 01:23:05.850
[Lizzie] Whitey.

01:23:09.114 --> 01:23:09.941
Whitey?

01:23:10.942 --> 01:23:13.118
Whitey, it's you, Whitey.

01:23:14.772 --> 01:23:15.816
Whitey.

01:23:18.906 --> 01:23:19.864
Whitey.

[rousing tv news theme]

01:23:34.966 --> 01:23:38.100
[Voiceover] Now on ANN,
this is The Whole Truth

01:23:38.143 --> 01:23:39.753
with Gale Chambers.

01:23:39.797 --> 01:23:41.538
Tonight, the Holden kidnapping,

01:23:41.581 --> 01:23:43.061
the exclusive update.

01:23:43.105 --> 01:23:45.150
We now go live to Gale Chambers,

01:23:45.194 --> 01:23:47.631
reporting from Verno
Beach, California.

01:23:47.674 --> 01:23:48.980
Good evening, I'm Gale Chambers,

01:23:49.024 --> 01:23:50.460
with The Whole Truth.

01:23:50.503 --> 01:23:51.765
I'm standing in front of the

01:23:51.809 --> 01:23:53.332
Verno Beach Police
Department and

01:23:53.376 --> 01:23:56.118
I cannot believe it
has been six months

01:23:56.161 --> 01:23:57.771
since the Holden kidnapping.

01:23:57.815 --> 01:23:59.251
Our main perpetrator
of the case,

01:23:59.295 --> 01:24:02.254
Rebecca Holden, died the
night Lizzie was found alive.

01:24:02.298 --> 01:24:06.258
Rebecca's motive for the
actual kidnapping, greed.

01:24:06.302 --> 01:24:07.564
Plain and simple.

01:24:07.607 --> 01:24:09.479
A woman that would
stop at nothing,

01:24:09.522 --> 01:24:11.437
including kidnapping and murder,

01:24:11.481 --> 01:24:13.048
to get what she wanted.

01:24:13.091 --> 01:24:15.093
The puzzle pieces of
this case were assembled

01:24:15.137 --> 01:24:17.226
with the help of Henry Spencer.

01:24:17.269 --> 01:24:19.532
Henry, known as
Whitey, to Lizzie

01:24:19.576 --> 01:24:21.099
is serving a reduced sentence,

01:24:21.143 --> 01:24:23.275
thanks to Lizzie's
impassioned testimony

01:24:23.319 --> 01:24:25.364
and his cooperation
with the police

01:24:25.408 --> 01:24:27.845
to ensure a safe
return of the teen.

01:24:27.888 --> 01:24:29.760
Henry's wife,
our psychic savior,

01:24:29.803 --> 01:24:32.545
Tracy Spencer has
not been so lucky.

01:24:32.589 --> 01:24:34.721
I'm sure she never
predicted a future

01:24:34.765 --> 01:24:36.593
of a life behind bars.

01:24:37.159 --> 01:24:38.116
All for fame.

01:24:39.683 --> 01:24:43.643
But she did not remember,
fame is a vapor.

01:24:43.687 --> 01:24:47.908
Popularity, and accident,
and riches take wings.

01:24:47.952 --> 01:24:50.346
Only one thing truly endures,

01:24:50.389 --> 01:24:52.739
and that is character.

01:24:53.479 --> 01:24:57.135
I'm Gale Chambers, and
that is the whole truth.

01:24:58.397 --> 01:24:59.442
What an ass.

01:25:18.765 --> 01:25:19.810
You ready?

01:25:19.853 --> 01:25:20.593
Are you kidding me?

01:25:20.637 --> 01:25:21.551
One Direction?

01:25:21.594 --> 01:25:22.769
Of course I'm ready.

01:25:23.770 --> 01:25:25.598
You guys have
fun, see you later.

01:25:27.165 --> 01:25:28.297
Hey, Judith.

01:25:28.340 --> 01:25:29.428
Do you wanna come?

01:25:29.472 --> 01:25:30.995
Yeah, come on Mom.

01:25:31.561 --> 01:25:32.431
I don't have a ticket.

01:25:33.954 --> 01:25:35.347
We're sponsoring the concert,

01:25:35.391 --> 01:25:36.609
I think you'll be okay.

01:25:37.306 --> 01:25:40.004
Yes, I'd love to come.

01:25:47.011 --> 01:25:48.143
Mom, I'm so excited.
