00:26.800 --> 00:29.760
-Joseph? Get in here, it's starting.
-Yeah? Coming.

00:29.840 --> 00:31.000
-<i>Hi.</i>
-<i>Hello.</i>

00:31.080 --> 00:33.200
<i>-So, let's start talking about music,</i>
-Thanks.

00:33.280 --> 00:35.600
<i>-since that's what you're most known for.</i>
-Who's that?

00:35.680 --> 00:37.360
I think she's the girl
that invited them.

00:37.440 --> 00:40.120
…the persona you've created
in Europe as well as…

00:40.200 --> 00:43.080
Is she crazy? What is that on her head?

00:43.160 --> 00:45.840

<i>"93 NTM"</i>
<i>I'm pronouncing it in French</i>

00:48.560 --> 00:50.920

00:51.000 --> 00:52.680
<i>And they'll be the first guests</i>
<i>on your Zenith.</i>

00:52.760 --> 00:54.320
<i>NTM, can you tell us what it means?</i>

00:54.400 --> 00:56.800
<i>93 is the district of Seine-Saint-Denis</i>

00:56.880 --> 00:58.440

00:58.520 --> 01:03.720
<i>Well, as soon as they will have</i>
<i>the first record out on the market,</i>

01:03.800 --> 01:06.360

02:29.400 --> 02:31.520
-Ooh!
-Yum-yum, wow!

02:31.600 --> 02:32.680
Vivi will you serve, please?

02:32.760 --> 02:35.640
-It looks delicious, ma'am.
-Don't call me ma'am, it's Granny.

02:35.720 --> 02:37.440
It looks delicious, Mrs. Granny.

02:37.520 --> 02:39.720
No way, no, newbies get to eat
after everyone else.

02:39.800 --> 02:41.280
-Newbies, newbies.
-Awesome.

02:41.360 --> 02:44.400
-Granny, your waitress is good.
-Yes? Yes, she's very good.

02:45.120 --> 02:47.040
-Think she looks pretty good too
-Easy!

02:47.120 --> 02:49.840
Classic Didier.

02:49.920 --> 02:52.760
-Alright, here we go!
-You do the honors.

02:52.840 --> 02:54.800
-I'm starving.
-He's always eating.

02:54.880 --> 02:56.600
-Okay.
-Do you smell that?

02:56.680 --> 02:58.400
-What?
-Dunno. Something smells weird.

02:58.480 --> 03:01.120
-Huh? Really?
-Sorry, no offense, Granny.

03:01.200 --> 03:03.400
-Do you smell it? Can you smell that?
-Don't smell anything.

03:03.480 --> 03:07.120
What do you mean?

03:07.200 --> 03:08.800
Oh, why did you do that, Didier?

03:08.880 --> 03:11.800
-Yes, Didier, why did you do that?
-Ah, don't worry.

03:11.880 --> 03:13.800
Don't you worry, honey,
you're still the most handsome.

03:13.880 --> 03:15.400
Aw!

03:15.480 --> 03:17.760
-Is he the most handsome?
-He's the most handsome.

03:17.840 --> 03:21.520
-No, Reak is the most handsome.
-He's very cute too.

03:21.600 --> 03:23.080
Very cute.

03:23.160 --> 03:24.920
So, have you guys been weighing options?

03:25.000 --> 03:26.240
When are you deciding?

03:26.320 --> 03:28.880
Yeah, we've had offers
from BMG, Labelle Noir, Virgin.

03:28.960 --> 03:31.320
-And so?
-And so, we're discussing all of them.

03:31.400 --> 03:33.680
Yeah, but most of them
don't know anything about rap.

03:33.760 --> 03:37.200
-Wanna sign us because they saw us on TV.
-So you wanna start a bidding war?

03:37.280 --> 03:39.160
Absolutely correct, madam.

03:39.240 --> 03:42.000
Well, don't go too far.
I put in a good word for you at EPIC.

03:42.080 --> 03:45.720
My colleague, Puydauby, who's very smart,
he's very eager to work with you.

03:45.800 --> 03:47.720
But he's just the artistic director.

03:47.800 --> 03:49.760
The guys who make the real decisions,
the money people above him,

03:49.840 --> 03:51.320
they don't waste time.

03:51.400 --> 03:53.160
They'll find someone to sign with them
any day now.

03:53.240 --> 03:55.680
I'm sorry, but we're not tryna waste time.

03:55.760 --> 03:58.400
We don't wanna be jerks,
just want them to respect our terms.

03:58.480 --> 04:02.160
And Puydauby, Epic,
that's all CBS. That's major.

04:02.240 --> 04:05.720
-They're gonna want us to conform somehow.
-Everyone wants to make rap mainstream.

04:05.800 --> 04:06.920
Why will this be any different?

04:07.000 --> 04:09.200
What about the band Trust
when they sing "Antisocial"?

04:09.280 --> 04:10.120
Is that mainstream?

04:11.000 --> 04:12.240
I dunno…

04:12.320 --> 04:14.880
I mean, think about Léo Ferré,
is he mainstream?

04:14.960 --> 04:16.680
-Colette Magny?
-Granny?

04:16.760 --> 04:18.560
Granny's not mainstream,
is she? Hey, Granny?

04:18.640 --> 04:20.880
But seriously,
those musicians are revolutionary

04:20.960 --> 04:23.280
and they're all with CBS.

04:23.360 --> 04:25.040
This needs more sauce.

04:25.120 --> 04:27.480
Vivi, could you go
heat up some sauce, please?

04:27.560 --> 04:28.960
It's all in the kitchen.

04:29.040 --> 04:33.000
You're right to not wanna conform
and refuse a lyricist, I'm with you there.

04:33.080 --> 04:36.840
You have to stay true to yourselves.
That's cool, but now,

04:36.920 --> 04:38.360
you gotta move to the next level.

04:38.440 --> 04:41.440
All I'm saying is that they're gonna
find someone to sign with them soon.

04:41.520 --> 04:44.040
-But do what you want.
-There you go. We always do what we want.

04:44.120 --> 04:45.360
That's it,
we're taking things to the next level,

04:45.440 --> 04:47.360
we're just waiting for this guy
to take off his make-up,

04:47.440 --> 04:49.840
finish our pasta,
then we're all going straight to the moon.

04:51.880 --> 04:53.200
-[kissing]
-[Didier] Ferrari, Formula 1.

04:53.280 --> 04:55.120
Nobody can keep up with us.

04:55.200 --> 04:57.040
Don't worry about us,
we move fast.

04:57.120 --> 04:59.400
-So fast.
-Don't worry.

04:59.480 --> 05:02.400
Good! That's very good, boys.
That's very, very good.

05:18.120 --> 05:19.280
Hello.

05:19.360 --> 05:20.880
What're you doing here?

05:20.960 --> 05:23.040
I just wanted to come say hi.

05:23.120 --> 05:24.920
Are you mad at me?

05:26.840 --> 05:28.120
Because of rehearsals?

05:28.200 --> 05:31.560
-You totally stood us up.
-Yeah, I know.

05:32.960 --> 05:34.080
I'm sorry.

05:35.400 --> 05:38.120
-Good TV show. Mmm.
-Yeah?

05:38.200 --> 05:40.040
Well, it's nice that you watched it.

05:40.120 --> 05:42.280
It's too bad we didn't see you very much.

05:43.000 --> 05:44.520
Well, what did you think of us overall?

05:44.600 --> 05:48.160
-"Us"?
-Yeah, us. NTM.

05:48.240 --> 05:50.520
I don't know. Did you watch it?

05:50.600 --> 05:53.040
Couldn't see you. You're way in back.

05:53.120 --> 05:54.240
A cheerleader.

05:54.960 --> 05:56.360
NTM, NTM…

05:56.440 --> 05:58.440
Vivi, you know you're not actually
part of the band, right?

05:58.520 --> 06:01.000
-Excuse me, what are you talking about?
-I'm saying you're getting screwed over.

06:01.080 --> 06:03.800
What? I don't mind being in the back.
I don't care about the spotlight.

06:03.880 --> 06:05.480
The boys are totally killing it right now.

06:05.560 --> 06:08.480
They're gonna be huge, change everything,
so why shouldn't I wanna be with them?

06:08.560 --> 06:09.800
You're just jealous!

06:09.880 --> 06:12.400
I can dance with them now
and still do my own thing on the side.

06:12.480 --> 06:14.320
-Besides, I can do what I want. I'm free.
-Free to do what?

06:14.400 --> 06:16.280
You're always with Bruno,
you don't hang out with us.

06:16.360 --> 06:18.360
I'd rather spend my time with him

06:18.440 --> 06:20.440
-than with you little wannabes…
-Miss Sullé, why are you on the premises?

06:20.520 --> 06:22.920
Miss Sullé,
I'm asking what you're doing here?

06:23.000 --> 06:25.520
You are no longer
a part of this institution. Leave now!

06:26.360 --> 06:27.360
Leave now!

06:41.120 --> 06:42.440
It's here.

06:46.000 --> 06:47.440
Yes?

06:47.520 --> 06:48.840
-Philippe? They're here.
-Yes?

06:48.920 --> 06:51.280
-Send them in.
-Have a wonderful meeting, guys.

06:54.160 --> 06:57.360
So, the basic idea is this.
We would start with an EP,

06:57.440 --> 07:00.400
I was thinking
maybe two tracks and a remix.

07:00.480 --> 07:03.000
We follow that up with a ten-track album.

07:03.080 --> 07:06.640
And then, eventually, if you agree to it,
we do a re-mixed version,

07:06.720 --> 07:09.200
with DJ remixes, bonus versions,
things like that.

07:09.280 --> 07:10.280
So, it will begin with…

07:10.360 --> 07:13.800
SUPREME NTM CEDES TO EPIC

07:13.880 --> 07:15.880
IRREVOCABLY

07:15.960 --> 07:18.640
SUBJECT TO PROSECUTION

07:19.600 --> 07:23.200
…and you'll get a 9% advance
on all royalties.

07:23.880 --> 07:25.800
And so, we'd commit to three albums.

07:25.880 --> 07:28.440
So, that means
we have to make three albums with you?

07:28.520 --> 07:31.120
It's a mutual commitment, but yeah.

07:31.200 --> 07:33.320
If I can be frank,
we've been following you.

07:33.400 --> 07:37.440
We've seen some of your TV appearances,
and your interview with Rap Attitude.

07:37.520 --> 07:40.320
And what we really want,
is for you to stay true to yourselves.

07:40.920 --> 07:42.360
And so, how many…

07:42.440 --> 07:44.520
roughly how many songs have you got…

07:44.600 --> 07:45.920
locked down?

07:50.360 --> 07:52.360
They've got five or six.

07:52.440 --> 07:55.560
But they're very prolific, you know.
We'll get you an album quickly.

07:55.640 --> 07:57.400
-That's good.
-You've read through it all, haven't you?

07:57.480 --> 07:58.320
-Of course.
-Well, that's good.

07:58.400 --> 08:00.320
-You can go ahead.
-Great. What page is it on?

08:00.400 --> 08:02.520
You'll sign on the last page,
right there…

08:02.600 --> 08:03.720
Okay.

08:03.800 --> 08:06.440
…then you just have to put your initials
on every page of the contract.

08:06.520 --> 08:08.600
-What's the date today?
-April 5.

08:15.160 --> 08:16.240
Alright.

08:18.520 --> 08:20.240
And don't forget your check.

08:21.000 --> 08:23.080
Hey, you guys! Fuck…

08:23.160 --> 08:25.040
20,000 francs.

08:25.120 --> 08:27.760
Shit, so you're really telling me
they haven't made a mistake?

08:27.840 --> 08:30.280
-They didn't, it was with all of us.
-No, guys, it's not a mistake.

08:30.360 --> 08:32.840
This is the advance on the royalties
and you'll get the rest…

08:32.920 --> 08:36.520
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!
Let's free the scene of the crime.

08:36.600 --> 08:38.640
Hey, hey! Hey, man, where're you going?

08:38.720 --> 08:40.960
I'm gonna go get fucked up, man!
20,000 francs!

08:41.040 --> 08:43.200
Are you serious?
We have to talk about the next steps.

08:43.280 --> 08:46.360
-Man, don't worry.
-Yeah? Didn't you just sign a contract?

08:46.440 --> 08:48.880
I didn't sign.
Just took their money.

08:48.960 --> 08:51.720
Bruno, tell him what a contract is,
he's really pissing me off!

08:51.800 --> 08:53.040
Pissing you off, that right?

08:53.120 --> 08:54.440
Enough with this bullshit.

08:54.520 --> 08:56.640
-I'm pissing you off?
-Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

08:57.480 --> 09:00.120
Guys, the single, let's focus on that.

09:02.000 --> 09:04.040
Bye, ladies. <i>Ciao!</i>

09:04.120 --> 09:05.120
Shit!

09:05.200 --> 09:10.080
Not ten, but 20! 20,000 francs!

09:16.600 --> 09:18.920
How many warnings have you gotten?

09:20.040 --> 09:21.400
I think that's the second.

09:21.480 --> 09:23.320
You're gonna be alright, you know that.

09:24.080 --> 09:26.040
I've been where you are. You'll get there.

09:28.360 --> 09:30.120
How much you owe them?

09:30.200 --> 09:32.280
I don't just owe electricity,
there's other stuff.

09:32.360 --> 09:34.440
I owe four months' rent.

09:34.520 --> 09:37.360
But it's not worth going through
the whole list, it's too long.

09:38.400 --> 09:41.880
Ever since I got blacklisted by Nova,
it's been hard.

09:45.920 --> 09:47.280
But it's not just that.

09:48.400 --> 09:49.720
What else is there?

09:50.840 --> 09:52.240
It's Béatrice.

09:55.400 --> 09:59.840
I miss her so much, man,
it's… so depressing.

09:59.920 --> 10:02.000
I swear, I feel like I'm dead.

10:02.080 --> 10:03.040
Fight for her!

10:03.120 --> 10:06.080
Take a risk, go find her,
and… beg her to listen.

10:06.160 --> 10:09.520
What're you talking about, man?
She doesn't wanna be with someone like me.

10:09.600 --> 10:10.920
She doesn't want a loser.

10:11.000 --> 10:13.760
Come on, it's not like she's Lady Diane.

10:15.080 --> 10:18.200
On top of that, I dunno how much I owe
my record dealer. Bullshit.

10:18.280 --> 10:20.000
Don't change the subject.

10:20.080 --> 10:22.480
Let's deal with one thing at a time, okay?

10:26.520 --> 10:28.760
[sighs] One thing at a time, Daniel.

10:29.800 --> 10:30.640
Hmm?

10:36.560 --> 10:40.200
[hubbub]

10:41.880 --> 10:45.920
Hey, look, it's a star!
You're on your way now.

10:46.000 --> 10:49.120
Concerts, albums, shows,
I'm so happy for you.

10:49.200 --> 10:50.640
Make the most of tonight.

10:57.240 --> 10:58.520
Cheers, man. Look at you!

11:01.360 --> 11:03.720
-Hey, are we going out tonight?
-Yeah, we're going to the Palace.

11:03.800 --> 11:05.960
The Palace? I'm so down!

11:06.040 --> 11:07.760
-Yeah.
-Where's island boy?

11:08.280 --> 11:09.120
I dunno.

11:09.200 --> 11:11.200
Bravo, you guys, seriously.

11:11.280 --> 11:12.600
You're killing it.

11:12.680 --> 11:15.000
The studio is booked, and we're all set.

11:15.080 --> 11:16.240
So, have you seen Didier?

11:17.600 --> 11:19.360
I'm getting a drink. You guys want one?

11:19.440 --> 11:20.480
Just a beer for me, thanks.

11:22.760 --> 11:24.200
Here's the pizza, there you go.

11:34.800 --> 11:37.680
[distant chatter]

11:45.400 --> 11:47.640
Vivi?

11:51.320 --> 11:52.320
Vivi?

12:05.680 --> 12:06.760
How are you?

12:10.880 --> 12:12.000
Why're you in here?

12:12.920 --> 12:15.160
More like why're you in here?
What's wrong?

12:15.240 --> 12:17.840
Nothing, really.
I just wanted to be alone for a bit.

12:17.920 --> 12:18.800
Go have fun.

12:18.880 --> 12:21.160
No, come on. Tell me what's wrong.

12:22.320 --> 12:24.560
Sometimes I feel like I don't even exist.

12:26.360 --> 12:27.880
What do you mean?

12:28.960 --> 12:30.840
You know those moments in life…

12:32.160 --> 12:34.600
those opportunities
you seem so good at grabbing?

12:34.680 --> 12:36.840
You're good at that too, Vivi.

12:37.600 --> 12:39.560
Doing lots of auditions and music videos.

12:39.640 --> 12:41.440
Yeah, but it's always the same thing.

12:41.520 --> 12:42.920
They just want a hot little mixed girl

12:43.000 --> 12:44.680
-who looks good in the background.
-So what?

12:44.760 --> 12:46.440
It's how it starts.

12:47.000 --> 12:49.200
You do those things for a while
and when you get tired of them

12:49.280 --> 12:51.320
you'll do your own thing.
And I'll be right there.

12:51.920 --> 12:53.400
I won't let you down.

12:54.320 --> 12:56.000
Vivi, you're free.

12:57.080 --> 12:58.920
That's the difference between you and me.

13:00.720 --> 13:01.680
I'm trapped now

13:01.760 --> 13:04.280
because I signed a fucking contract
for three albums.

13:05.840 --> 13:08.160
Spending entire days like an idiot,
looking for rhymes.

13:08.760 --> 13:11.080
I'm acting like a singer,
but I can't sing a note.

13:11.160 --> 13:12.920
I'm not a fucking artist, you know.

13:13.000 --> 13:15.840
-Sure you are.
-I'm not. I'm not.

13:15.920 --> 13:17.840
Of course, you are.
You just don't realize it.

13:19.680 --> 13:22.200
It's true that you can't read music
and that you sing super-flat, though.

13:22.280 --> 13:23.360
What?

13:23.440 --> 13:24.760
They used to call me Pavarotti.

13:24.840 --> 13:26.640
-Ask anyone, they'll tell you.
-Sure it wasn't something else?

13:26.720 --> 13:28.800
Might've been. Can't say.

13:33.680 --> 13:36.040
Don't give up on me, I need you.

13:37.720 --> 13:39.480
I won't make it without you.

13:41.000 --> 13:42.280
We're in this together, okay?

13:44.600 --> 13:45.520
Love you.

13:47.760 --> 13:50.040
Don't cry, this is a party!

14:19.760 --> 14:21.320
[sighs] Shit!

14:40.160 --> 14:41.160
[sighs]

15:09.560 --> 15:10.760
Hello?

15:14.200 --> 15:15.480
Yeah, yeah, that's me.

15:17.120 --> 15:18.120
With who?

15:28.960 --> 15:31.040
MYLENE FARMER
"LET THEM BE SWEET"

15:33.280 --> 15:34.520
Daniel?

15:34.600 --> 15:36.000
-Hi there.
-Hello.

15:36.080 --> 15:38.320
My name's Jen
and I take care of production for Mylène.

15:38.400 --> 15:40.800
I'm so sorry but we're super busy,
I couldn't secure an office.

15:40.880 --> 15:42.440
We'll sit right here, okay?

15:47.040 --> 15:50.920
I love that picture,
it's wonderful. It's so her.

15:51.440 --> 15:52.840
Thanks, Sylvie.

15:52.920 --> 15:55.280
You want a tea or a coffee? You good?

15:55.360 --> 15:57.320
-No, I'm good thanks.
-Okay.

15:57.400 --> 15:59.840
You know that our whole team
loves your work?

15:59.920 --> 16:01.040
It's incredible.

16:01.120 --> 16:05.040
And Mylène
has danced to your music at Globo.

16:05.120 --> 16:07.920
-And I have too, of course.
-Is it okay if I use your first name?

16:08.000 --> 16:09.200
Oh, yes, of course.

16:09.280 --> 16:11.200
What exactly do you need from me?

16:11.280 --> 16:12.960
Let me get straight to the point.

16:13.040 --> 16:14.080
This is the mixed tape

16:14.160 --> 16:17.240
and there are three demos on here
that need a little jumpstart, a boost.

16:17.320 --> 16:18.240
They need to be,

16:18.320 --> 16:20.480
uh… Deenastified!

16:20.560 --> 16:22.200
You know what I mean?

16:22.280 --> 16:25.280
So, I'll let you listen to those
and we'll be in touch soon, alright?

16:25.360 --> 16:27.360
When do you think
you'll have something to show us?

16:28.240 --> 16:29.880
If you could do it in two days
that'd be perfect

16:29.960 --> 16:31.920
because we're slammed right now, okay?

16:32.000 --> 16:34.600
I'm sure I don't have to give you
the whole speech about confidentiality?

16:34.680 --> 16:37.280
I wouldn't insult you by telling you
about lawyers and lawsuits.

16:37.360 --> 16:40.120
I'm really sorry, but…

16:40.200 --> 16:43.440
I… it would be great
if I could speak to Mylène a bit first.

16:44.680 --> 16:47.320
I understand, but she's not in Paris.

16:47.400 --> 16:50.600
But you'll meet her in the studio soon.
It'll be great, okay?

16:50.680 --> 16:52.240
Well, it was a real pleasure.

16:52.320 --> 16:53.160
Welcome to the team.

16:53.240 --> 16:54.520
Thanks.

17:02.280 --> 17:05.880
-[Philippe] After you. Here we are.
-[man] There's still an issue…

17:05.960 --> 17:08.280
You know Fred Versailles,
our producer.

17:08.360 --> 17:10.560
And this is Leo, our sound engineer.

17:10.640 --> 17:13.320
I'm off, but I'll be back with expense
info later, like we discussed,

17:13.400 --> 17:14.680
after you see how it's going.

17:14.760 --> 17:16.280
That work? Yeah, see you later.

17:17.200 --> 17:20.080
I've set you up with two SL1200,
right, like we talked about?

17:20.160 --> 17:22.080
Well, I also brought my SP1200

17:22.160 --> 17:23.040
Great.

17:23.120 --> 17:25.400
-Where can I put it?
-I'll take it.

17:25.480 --> 17:27.160
-Let's set it up over here.
-Be careful.

17:27.240 --> 17:28.360
Of course, yeah. yeah.

17:28.440 --> 17:30.760
This way,
we can patch it through the compressors.

17:30.840 --> 17:32.960
Hang on, wait,
you're gonna compress my sound?

17:33.040 --> 17:35.600
I mean,
it's an incredible machine, with tubes.

17:35.680 --> 17:38.320
It's gonna bring some warmth
and some brilliance to your sounds.

17:39.000 --> 17:41.000
But it's up to you, ultimately.

17:41.080 --> 17:43.840
And we have the console.

17:43.920 --> 17:46.400
Top of the line. Forty-eight tracks.

17:47.240 --> 17:50.240
With amazing equalizers in all of them,
they can handle all your frequencies.

17:50.320 --> 17:53.680
Hang on, this is all digital.
We said we weren't gonna change the sound.

17:54.200 --> 17:57.000
No, of course.
We'll keep it analog, that's fine.

17:57.720 --> 17:58.560
Okay?

17:59.160 --> 18:00.600
Bruno, come here.

18:00.680 --> 18:01.760
Let me show you the set up.

18:06.520 --> 18:07.400
Alright.

18:08.600 --> 18:11.120
This is where we'll record your vocals.

18:11.200 --> 18:13.520
So, I've put out quite a few mic options.

18:14.200 --> 18:15.120
You see?

18:15.840 --> 18:17.200
You'll have to choose.

18:17.280 --> 18:21.160
There's the 414,
which is pretty blunt and unforgiving.

18:21.240 --> 18:23.560
Then we have the U47, which is a classic.

18:23.640 --> 18:26.560
And here, is the U67,
which is my personal favorite.

18:27.160 --> 18:28.640
It's got a really warm tone.

18:28.720 --> 18:30.920
Anyway, you guys get to decide.

18:31.000 --> 18:31.920
-Is that okay?
-Yeah.

18:32.000 --> 18:34.360
Alright, guys, what're we doing?
How would you like to work?

18:34.440 --> 18:36.840
We can't do anything without Didier,
we'll have to wait.

18:40.360 --> 18:43.760
[quietly] Hey, since when do we need
this much gear to make a track?

18:43.840 --> 18:45.960
Seriously, this isn't what rap is about.

18:49.760 --> 18:51.840
That jerk still hasn't shown up.

18:51.920 --> 18:53.520
Now he's really pissing me off.

18:53.600 --> 18:54.840
We look like fools.

18:54.920 --> 18:57.000
Where the hell is he?

18:57.520 --> 18:58.760
What do you wanna do?

19:02.280 --> 19:04.920
-[upbeat music]
-[hubbub]

19:20.520 --> 19:22.000
-Hey!
-Hey!

19:22.560 --> 19:23.800
-Hey!
-Are you fucking kidding me?

19:23.880 --> 19:25.960
I spent a whole week looking for you!

19:26.040 --> 19:27.680
Hey, take it easy now.

19:28.440 --> 19:29.400
Look.

19:29.480 --> 19:31.640
Do you remember
the little intern we met at Polydor?

19:31.720 --> 19:32.760
Hey, Bruno. What's up?

19:32.840 --> 19:34.800
He's the real deal.
I'm crashing at his place right now.

19:34.880 --> 19:35.960
Didier!

19:36.040 --> 19:37.520
-We're supposed to be in studio now!
-What?

19:37.600 --> 19:41.000
If you don't settle down,
there's going to be trouble. Alright?

19:41.080 --> 19:41.920
Good.

19:42.840 --> 19:44.200
A beer for my buddy.

19:44.280 --> 19:46.080
Shit, Didier,
we have to record the single.

19:46.160 --> 19:47.200
Everyone's waiting now.

19:47.280 --> 19:48.760
-Oh, we have to?
-Yes!

19:48.840 --> 19:50.360
Have to what? Huh?

19:50.440 --> 19:51.960
Let me explain something to you.

19:52.040 --> 19:54.120
We just stole their money.

19:54.200 --> 19:57.280
Huh? We just pulled off a fucking heist.
Without a gun, my boy.

19:57.360 --> 20:00.640
Have you gone nuts or what?
Hey! Isn't this what you wanted?

20:00.720 --> 20:02.680
Doing what we love on our terms?
Hey, Didier!

20:02.760 --> 20:04.320
You think it's different somewhere else?

20:04.400 --> 20:06.560
All the record labels are the same.
You know what?

20:06.640 --> 20:07.880
-You're freaking out!
-I'm freaking out?

20:07.960 --> 20:08.840
Yeah!

20:11.120 --> 20:12.480
You listen to me very carefully.

20:12.560 --> 20:15.040
I was doing my thing
before those assholes showed up, okay?

20:15.120 --> 20:17.520
I took their money,
now fuck 'em! That's all.

20:17.600 --> 20:18.480
I'll tell you something.

20:18.560 --> 20:20.040
Your little heist,
that's just chump change

20:20.120 --> 20:23.520
20,000? Don't make me laugh!
You can't even buy a Renault 5 with that!

20:23.600 --> 20:25.720
-What? What did you say?
-And you wanna cut and run now?

20:25.800 --> 20:28.040
You can't even buy a Renault 5 for 20,000!

20:28.120 --> 20:30.240
Listen to me, Didier!

20:30.320 --> 20:33.640
The real money heist, bro,
we can't pull that off now.

20:33.720 --> 20:35.160
It's further down the line.

20:37.720 --> 20:38.680
I'll be waiting.

20:39.800 --> 20:40.760
Yeah, yeah.

20:43.200 --> 20:44.880
Hey, Bruno leave or what?

20:46.120 --> 20:46.960
Bruno!

20:47.520 --> 20:48.880
Bruno?

20:48.960 --> 20:51.840
Hey, hey, hey! Shut the fuck up!
Stop talking about him!

21:16.880 --> 21:18.080
hey, what the fuck's wrong with you!

21:18.160 --> 21:19.560
You want me to kick your ass?

21:19.640 --> 21:21.520
What's the problem?
Calm down, man!

21:24.000 --> 21:26.400
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh, yeah!

21:26.480 --> 21:30.280
Stop! Stop it! Hey, hey, hey!

21:30.360 --> 21:31.680
-No!
-Wait, don't go away! Wait!

21:31.760 --> 21:32.640
Mwah! Mwah!

21:33.560 --> 21:35.280
Think you're hot, but you're disgusting!

21:37.200 --> 21:38.400
[Farran] Hey, don't take all of it!

21:38.480 --> 21:41.600
I took it all, ha! I always do, man.

21:42.800 --> 21:44.720
Stop, stop! Come on, wait, man!

21:50.400 --> 21:51.280
Woo!

21:57.240 --> 21:59.000
Well, let's go back to mine.

21:59.880 --> 22:01.480
Cool.

22:04.800 --> 22:07.480
-King of the world!
-[laughs]

22:08.720 --> 22:11.080
Look, look, hang,
look, hang on, wait, wait.

22:11.160 --> 22:12.440
Wait.

22:12.520 --> 22:14.600
Check it out.

22:16.000 --> 22:17.920
-How are you?
-Hello.

22:18.000 --> 22:19.320
A pack of Gold's, please.

22:19.400 --> 22:21.360
Uh, two coffees with brandy, please.

22:22.320 --> 22:25.000
No, you know what?
Forget the coffee, just two brandies.

22:25.080 --> 22:27.640
<i>The motorcyclist,</i>
<i>21-year-old Thomas Claudio,</i>

22:27.720 --> 22:29.240
was not wearing a helmet.

22:29.320 --> 22:31.960
<i>and died</i>
<i>while being transferred to the hospital.</i>

22:32.040 --> 22:33.960
<i>The police are calling it an accident,</i>

22:34.040 --> 22:36.160
<i>however, young witnesses</i>
<i>in the Vaulx-en-Velin district</i>

22:36.240 --> 22:38.640
<i>say that when the police</i>
<i>saw the motorcycle coming,</i>

22:38.720 --> 22:41.880
<i>they deliberately blocked its path</i>
<i>with their vehicle, in order to stop it.</i>

22:41.960 --> 22:44.320
<i>The reaction yesterday was immediate.</i>

22:44.400 --> 22:46.240
<i>Thomas's friends,</i>
<i>youths from the district,</i>

22:46.320 --> 22:48.200
<i>started setting fire to several cars.</i>

22:48.280 --> 22:49.760
<i>Fire and riots ensued,</i>

22:49.840 --> 22:51.960
<i>with only one goal in mind for the youths:</i>

22:52.040 --> 22:54.960
<i>to make the police pay</i>
<i>for what they considered to be a crime.</i>

22:55.040 --> 22:58.440
<i>I think after everything that's happened</i>
<i>over the last four days,</i>

22:58.520 --> 23:00.720
<i>we need to be asking ourselves</i>
<i>different questions:</i>

23:00.800 --> 23:03.960
<i>not how do we solve these problems,</i>
<i>but why is this happening.</i>

23:04.040 --> 23:06.120
<i>Many young people are rebelling</i>

23:06.200 --> 23:08.760
<i>in memory,</i>
<i>of all their friends who've died</i>

23:08.840 --> 23:11.000
<i>and now especially, for Thomas.</i>

23:11.080 --> 23:14.680
<i>The thing is, everyone's getting tired</i>
<i>of seeing brothers mourning brothers,</i>

23:14.760 --> 23:17.480
<i>mothers mourning sons,</i>
<i>sisters mourning brothers.</i>

23:17.560 --> 23:22.000
Also, where there's injustice,
there's violence, and vice versa.

23:22.080 --> 23:23.720
<i>Why would you just kill someone like that?</i>

23:23.800 --> 23:26.520
<i>I mean, they just killed him.</i>
<i>They ran him over.</i>

23:26.600 --> 23:29.760
and you know, all the parents,
they're losing their minds. They're all…

23:29.840 --> 23:32.920
they'll never be able to forget this,
and for what?

23:33.000 --> 23:35.920
And the cops don't care about us,
it's a crime, that's all.

I'm sorry.
I was so stupid, I just came to apologize.

38:13.200 --> 38:15.720

38:17.840 --> 38:20.520
I thought that the enemy was

38:20.600 --> 38:23.200
a society
that didn't accept people like us.

38:23.880 --> 38:25.440
So, what I figured was…

38:26.840 --> 38:30.120
I dunno, was that it was finally our time
to find our place in all of it.
