(barking)

01:01.333 --> 01:04.333
(Bingo/Rolly speak)

01:04.333 --> 01:06.208
Ah. I've been hoping
it would rain,

01:06.208 --> 01:09.583
so I could try out
these pet-perfect
rain hats I invented!

01:09.583 --> 01:11.750
The pyramid shape
works great.

01:11.750 --> 01:15.333
The rain goes "swoosh"
right off all four sides.

01:15.333 --> 01:17.458
(barking)

01:22.000 --> 01:23.708
What do you think
of yours, Hissy?

01:25.125 --> 01:27.000
(meows complainingly)

01:27.000 --> 01:31.250
I'm guessing
that meow means,
"Dry me off."

01:31.250 --> 01:33.583
That meow did mean,
"Dry me off."

01:36.875 --> 01:39.875
(dramatic music playing on TV)

01:46.125 --> 01:47.375
(barks)

01:51.375 --> 01:52.500
(howls)

01:55.166 --> 01:56.250
(barks)

01:56.250 --> 01:57.875
Both:
Yay!

01:57.875 --> 02:01.875
Now that I've fixed the bridge,
the dog show can go on
as planned,

02:01.875 --> 02:06.000
bringing furriness, cuteness,
and bark-bark-barks to all.

02:06.000 --> 02:10.458
Remember, Captain Dog
is always just a bone-call away

02:10.458 --> 02:12.875
Arf, arf and away!

02:12.875 --> 02:15.458
We interrupt
this program to bring you
some important news.

02:15.458 --> 02:17.583
Ooh, this sounds important.

02:17.583 --> 02:21.375
The Great Pyramids of Egypt
have mysteriously disappeared!

02:21.375 --> 02:24.583
-Oh, no!
-The pyramids, shown here
before they disappeared,

02:24.583 --> 02:27.833
were admired for being old,
triangular and pointy.

02:27.833 --> 02:32.458
But now they can't be admired
at all because, they're gone!

02:32.458 --> 02:35.333
How could giant pyramids
have just disappeared?

02:35.333 --> 02:38.333
No one has any idea
how the pyramids
disappeared.

02:38.333 --> 02:41.500
But until they are found,
the entire world will continue
to wonder,

02:41.500 --> 02:43.333
"Hey, where'd those things go?"

02:43.333 --> 02:47.000
This is terrible!
I've always wanted to see
those pyramids up close,

02:47.000 --> 02:50.208
but now they're not
even there to see!

02:50.208 --> 02:54.166
-(whimpers)
-Ah. Try to stay dry today.

02:54.166 --> 02:58.500
I'll see you when I get home
from work. (sighs)

02:58.500 --> 03:00.583
Rolly, did you see
how sad Bob was

03:00.583 --> 03:02.625
about those pyramids
being missing?

03:02.625 --> 03:06.375
Yeah. It was like
an upside-down smile
landed right on his face.

03:07.875 --> 03:11.375
Well, we're gonna make sure
an upside-up smile
lands there instead.

03:11.375 --> 03:15.125
Hissy, Rolly and I
are going on a mission
to find the pyramids for Bob.

03:15.125 --> 03:17.125
-Wanna come?
-Uh, no thanks.

03:17.125 --> 03:20.416
I really just wanna sit here
in this warm house and stay dry.

03:20.416 --> 03:23.458
(thunder rumbles)

03:23.458 --> 03:26.291
On second thought,
what's the weather like
in Egypt?

03:29.958 --> 03:35.000
Welcome to sunny and dry Egypt,
home of the pyramids!

03:38.958 --> 03:43.083
I mean, home where
the pyramids used to be!

03:43.083 --> 03:47.458
I guess we'll have
to change that on all
the posters and brochures.

03:47.458 --> 03:50.583
You can see here the kinds
of drawings that ancient
Egyptians drew

03:50.583 --> 03:55.208
inside the pyramids
and on the walls
in the underground passages.

03:59.458 --> 04:03.458
Those ancient Egyptians
knew how to treat a kitty right.

04:03.458 --> 04:05.875
And in some
of those underground passages,

04:05.875 --> 04:09.375
you might find a mummy
like this one!

04:13.375 --> 04:15.875
Looks like the guy
has ouchies all over
his body.

04:15.875 --> 04:18.750
Like when Bob wrapped my foot
after I stepped on that bee.

04:18.750 --> 04:23.708
Except you kept going...
(growling) tryin' to pull
the bandage off!

04:23.708 --> 04:28.500
Oh, yeah? Well, I--
I-- (grunting) Whoa!

04:33.500 --> 04:35.458
So where do you think
we should start our mission?

04:35.458 --> 04:38.000
Maybe we should go
to where the pyramids
disappeared from.

04:38.000 --> 04:41.583
Might find some clues there
about where they disappeared to.

04:41.583 --> 04:45.583
Is this the bus that takes us
where the pyramids used to be?

04:45.583 --> 04:46.875
Yes, it is.

04:46.875 --> 04:48.458
All aboard!

04:48.458 --> 04:50.875
I'm gonna wanna sing,
"The wheels on the bus
go 'round and 'round"

04:50.875 --> 04:54.250
-on the way.
-Because they do
go 'round and 'round!

04:56.958 --> 04:58.500
You comin' with us, Hissy?

04:58.500 --> 05:00.458
Nah, you can go on
without me

05:00.458 --> 05:02.583
while I'm napping here
without you.

05:02.583 --> 05:04.000
Catch you later, kitty cat!

05:05.000 --> 05:06.583
(wheels screeching)

05:06.583 --> 05:11.583
(yawns, sighs)
This beats sitting
on a rainy windowsill any day.

05:11.583 --> 05:12.875
(sighs)

05:16.166 --> 05:18.458
Boy (sing-songy):
We get to ride a camel!

05:18.458 --> 05:19.750
Whee-hee!

05:19.750 --> 05:22.458
Please don't make
any loud noises,

05:22.458 --> 05:25.291
as these animals
are easily spooked,

05:25.291 --> 05:29.583
and keep your arms and legs
on top of your camel
at all times,

05:29.583 --> 05:31.833
'cause away we go!

05:31.833 --> 05:35.375
(camels bellowing)

05:36.833 --> 05:41.875
"The Great Sphinx is a marvel
to behold. Some say
this giant statue

05:41.875 --> 05:45.375
was built to stand guard
over the pyramids.

05:45.375 --> 05:48.500
Well, she didn't
do a very good job.
They're nowhere in sight.

05:48.500 --> 05:53.166
-(camel bellows)
-Oh, look! A camel!

05:53.166 --> 05:55.375
Here, camel, camel, camel!

05:57.291 --> 06:00.583
Esther would love
one of those scarves.

06:02.708 --> 06:05.625
Rolly:
Looks like this big doggie's
nose fell off.

06:05.625 --> 06:08.583
Maybe it fell in the sand.
You wanna dig down
and get it?

06:08.583 --> 06:11.625
(grunting)

06:11.625 --> 06:14.208
I was gonna say,
"See if we can find the nose,"

06:14.208 --> 06:17.416
but I guess all I needed to say
was, "You wanna dig?"

06:17.416 --> 06:19.500
That's all you ever
have to say.

06:25.875 --> 06:29.000
Sure is, windy here. (grunts)

06:29.000 --> 06:31.708
-Whoa! Ooh!
-(clatters)

06:31.708 --> 06:33.125
Esther!

06:34.833 --> 06:36.625
Esther!

06:38.333 --> 06:39.500
Hey, look what I found!

06:42.375 --> 06:44.083
It's a secret stairway!

06:44.083 --> 06:46.083
Maybe the pyramids
are hidden down there!

06:46.083 --> 06:48.583
Wanna run down and see--

06:48.583 --> 06:51.458
I guess all I needed to say
was, "You wanna run?"

06:53.000 --> 06:55.708
Where are you, Esther?

06:55.708 --> 06:57.000
Whoa!

06:57.000 --> 06:58.500
Ooh!

06:58.500 --> 07:02.875
On your left you can
see sand, and on your right,
more sand.

07:05.458 --> 07:07.208
-(pops)
-(camel bellows)

07:11.166 --> 07:13.333
-Hissy: Huh?
-(grumbling)

07:13.333 --> 07:15.375
I'm on a camel,
in the middle of the desert.

07:16.708 --> 07:20.458
Wait! What? What am I doing
on a camel in the middle
of the desert?

07:20.458 --> 07:23.833
-(yowling)
-(bellowing)

07:23.833 --> 07:27.333
Help!
Runaway camel! Help!

07:34.500 --> 07:37.458
Look at these cool drawings
all over the walls.

07:37.458 --> 07:40.833
I wonder if this is what
they watched instead of TV
before there was TV.

07:40.833 --> 07:43.750
Looks like a pretty good show.

07:43.750 --> 07:46.083
Rolly! Check out my shadow!

07:46.083 --> 07:48.416
I'm a horse! (laughs)

07:48.416 --> 07:49.708
Look at this one!

07:49.708 --> 07:52.708
(mumbling)

07:52.708 --> 07:54.625
I'm an elephant
playing trumpet!

07:54.625 --> 07:58.333
-Esther! Mm!
-(laughing)

07:58.333 --> 08:00.625
That's a good one, Bingo.
You're a mummy!

08:00.625 --> 08:02.000
Who's a what?

08:02.000 --> 08:04.583
-Rolly, that's not me!
-Well, it's not me, either!

08:06.291 --> 08:07.708
Esther!

08:07.708 --> 08:09.583
Both:
It's a mummy!

08:09.583 --> 08:11.708
Esther!

08:11.708 --> 08:13.625
How fast can mummies run?

08:13.625 --> 08:16.208
I don't know, but I hope dogs
can run faster!

08:16.208 --> 08:18.958
Whoooa! Whoa!

08:18.958 --> 08:20.833
(dogs panting)

08:20.833 --> 08:22.458
This way!

08:24.708 --> 08:27.083
Maybe that mummy is looking
for the pyramids, too.

08:27.083 --> 08:28.583
Not if we find them first!

08:29.583 --> 08:31.416
-Both:
Oooh!
-(screeching noise)

08:34.625 --> 08:35.708
There's nowhere to go!

08:35.708 --> 08:39.125
Mmm, mmm! Esther!

08:39.125 --> 08:40.208
What are we gonna do?

08:40.208 --> 08:42.125
There's only one thing
we can do!

08:42.125 --> 08:45.166
Dig, Rolly!
Dig like we've never
dug before!

08:45.166 --> 08:47.208
So it's a good thing
we have dug before!

But we still haven't
found the missing pyramids

09:36.708 --> 09:40.291
that Bob wants to see someday,
and-- Look out!

09:40.291 --> 09:42.708
Get me off this thing!

09:42.708 --> 09:45.875
-Hissy?
-All I wanted
was a nice, warm nap!

09:45.875 --> 09:47.583
We'll save you, Hissy!

09:47.583 --> 09:48.750
Hang on!

09:50.708 --> 09:52.000
Follow me!

09:56.000 --> 09:58.458
Ohh-- Ooh! Huh?

09:58.458 --> 10:00.500
Hm. Perfect color.

10:00.500 --> 10:03.125
Now I wonder if they
take credit cards?

10:03.125 --> 10:05.500
-Made it!
-Okay! Now that we're up here,

10:05.500 --> 10:08.416
we need to slide down
this sand till we can get
in front of the camel

10:08.416 --> 10:10.208
and save Hissy!

10:10.208 --> 10:13.166
You mean we came all the way
up this mountain just so we
could slide down it?

10:13.166 --> 10:15.875
-Yep!
-This is gonna be so much fun!

10:15.875 --> 10:17.583
What are we gonna
slide down on?

10:17.583 --> 10:19.125
Nothing but our bottoms.

10:19.125 --> 10:20.375
Hey, I got one of those!

10:20.375 --> 10:24.583
-Whoo-hoooo!
-Bottoms away!

10:28.416 --> 10:29.458
Both:
Ooh!

10:29.458 --> 10:30.750
Stop! In the name of the dog!

10:30.750 --> 10:33.291
(bleats)

10:33.291 --> 10:34.750
(meows)

10:34.750 --> 10:35.750
Ooh!

10:37.458 --> 10:41.291
Hello? Cat stuck
in the sand here!

10:42.875 --> 10:44.500
How was your nap?

10:44.500 --> 10:46.583
(spitting)

10:46.583 --> 10:48.000
Sandy.

10:48.000 --> 10:49.208
I'm just glad
you're okay.

10:49.208 --> 10:51.958
It's a good thing
I brought my bottom
with me to help out.

10:51.958 --> 10:53.750
Not sure what that means.

10:53.750 --> 10:55.875
But thanks!

10:55.875 --> 10:58.291
Rolly! You can stop digging.

10:58.291 --> 11:02.208
-We already dug Hissy out.
-Yeah, but there's something
else down here to dig out, too.

11:02.208 --> 11:04.125
Something giant and pointy.

11:04.125 --> 11:06.000
Rolly! You found a pyramid!

11:06.000 --> 11:07.625
I did?

11:07.625 --> 11:10.291
It's the right shape,
just like those hats
Bob made for us,

11:10.291 --> 11:11.958
but bigger,
and in Egypt!

11:11.958 --> 11:13.416
They were here all the time?

11:13.416 --> 11:17.583
Yeah! Buried in the sand!
It'll take us forever
to dig out the rest of 'em.

11:17.583 --> 11:18.750
Rolly:
All done!

11:21.583 --> 11:23.333
Look at me, Bingo!

11:23.333 --> 11:25.750
Look what Rolly found, Hissy!

11:25.750 --> 11:27.583
Hissy?

11:27.583 --> 11:29.875
(spitting)

11:29.875 --> 11:34.000
I should've just stayed
at home.

11:34.000 --> 11:35.875
Experts and tourists
were thrilled with the news

11:35.875 --> 11:39.000
that the Pyramids of Egypt
were found earlier today.

11:39.000 --> 11:41.250
The triangle-y things
were discovered
in the exact spot

11:41.250 --> 11:43.208
they had always been in.

11:43.208 --> 11:45.583
They were just buried
after a sandstorm
and no one was smart enough

11:45.583 --> 11:48.000
to dig in the same place
they already were.

11:48.000 --> 11:50.291
Except my brother
was smart enough.

11:50.291 --> 11:52.875
Ohh, this is fantastic!

11:52.875 --> 11:57.458
Now I'll be able
to go to Egypt someday
and see the pyramids!

11:57.458 --> 11:59.750
Maybe I'll even take you
with me!

11:59.750 --> 12:02.416
I bet Hissy would love
to come along, too!

12:02.416 --> 12:04.375
(thunder rumbles)

12:05.958 --> 12:10.875
Ugh, as long as I don't
have to ride there on a camel.

12:10.875 --> 12:13.875
(laughing)

12:19.083 --> 12:21.000
Bob:
Boy, am I late.

12:21.000 --> 12:22.208
Look at him
go one way,

12:22.208 --> 12:23.833
and then look at him
go the other!

12:23.833 --> 12:25.875
I've never looked at him
go so fast!

12:25.875 --> 12:28.708
I need that, to put this one
right under here, oh!

12:28.708 --> 12:30.125
Go, Bob, go!

12:30.125 --> 12:31.833
I'm almost
ready for work!

12:31.833 --> 12:33.375
I got my bag.
Got my lunch.

12:33.375 --> 12:36.083
Got the new doggy
squeaker toy I designed.

12:36.083 --> 12:37.166
(squeaking)

12:37.166 --> 12:38.333
(laughs)

12:38.333 --> 12:40.500
That's a sound that always
makes me happy.

12:40.500 --> 12:42.708
(gasps)
Oh. I almost forgot!

12:42.708 --> 12:45.208
Tomorrow's Mother's Day,
and if I don't mail this card

12:45.208 --> 12:47.583
today, my mom
won't get it in time.

12:47.583 --> 12:52.000
Oh, Mom's gonna
be so happy when she sees
this envelope in her mailbox!

12:52.000 --> 12:55.625
Orange is her favorite color
and her favorite fruit!

12:55.625 --> 12:58.625
-(dogs panting)
-Here's the envelope
and here's the stamp.

12:58.625 --> 13:03.000
Just gotta stick this stamp on
so the card gets to where
it needs to go,

13:03.000 --> 13:06.166
then write my mom's name
and off I go!

13:06.166 --> 13:07.958
Can't go, don't
have my keys.

13:07.958 --> 13:10.583
Have fun doing
whatever you do
when I'm not here!

13:11.708 --> 13:13.875
That was fun, watching Bob
get ready to leave.

13:13.875 --> 13:16.000
I can't wait until
we get to watch him
come home.

13:16.000 --> 13:18.083
(robotic voice)
Oh, no.

13:18.083 --> 13:19.125
What's wrong, Arf?

13:19.125 --> 13:21.250
Arf sees something
Bob dropped on the floor.

13:21.250 --> 13:24.583
It's orange, but it's not
an orange.

13:24.583 --> 13:27.750
It's the card in the envelope
for Bob's orange-loving mom!

13:27.750 --> 13:32.000
Oh, no! Bob must've
dropped it on his way
out the door!

13:32.000 --> 13:35.583
He was moving so fast,
all pe-yoo pe-yoo
pe-yoo pe-yoo pe-yoo!

13:35.583 --> 13:37.083
He didn't even see
where it went!

13:37.083 --> 13:39.000
Look how happy
Bob's mom is.

13:39.000 --> 13:42.625
If she doesn't
get that card in time,
Bob'll have to put a sad picture

13:42.625 --> 13:44.000
of her up there, instead.

13:44.000 --> 13:46.750
And Arf will be sad, too.

13:46.750 --> 13:49.416
Boo-hoo. Boo-hoo.

13:49.416 --> 13:54.500
No. No one is going to be sad,
because Rolly and I are going
to deliver that card ourselves.

13:54.500 --> 13:56.458
Arf would be happy
if you did that.

13:56.458 --> 13:59.000
Also, Arf's face
would be dryer.

13:59.000 --> 14:02.208
Come on, Rolly.
We're going on
a Mother's Day mission.

14:02.208 --> 14:06.208
Arf is done crying.
But Arf's nose is still
a little runny.

14:06.208 --> 14:07.333
Blow.

14:07.333 --> 14:09.000

How are we gonna
deliver this card

15:03.208 --> 15:05.625
when we don't even know
where Bob's mom lives?

15:05.625 --> 15:07.958
But we do know where she lives.

15:07.958 --> 15:11.125
Bob stuck a flag stamp
on here. Which obviously means

15:11.125 --> 15:14.208
that Bob's mom lives someplace
with a big flag in front.

15:14.208 --> 15:15.750
Is that what the stamp means?

15:15.750 --> 15:17.500
What else could it mean?

15:17.500 --> 15:19.708
So all we have to do
is find a place with a flag
in front of it,

15:19.708 --> 15:22.208
and Bob's mom
will live right there!

15:22.208 --> 15:25.583
Flagless, flag-free...

15:25.583 --> 15:26.625
Rolly, look!

15:26.625 --> 15:28.166
(horn honking sound)

15:28.166 --> 15:30.833
There's a flag,
just like the one
Bob put on the envelope!

15:30.833 --> 15:34.583
Then let's deliver the card
and make this the happiest
Mother's Day ever!

15:36.375 --> 15:40.083
Whoa! Bob's mom's car
is shiny!

15:40.083 --> 15:41.625
and you and I look good!

15:41.625 --> 15:44.000
Why, hello, there.
My name's Dallie.

15:44.000 --> 15:45.875
What's yours?

15:45.875 --> 15:48.083
I'm Bingo.
And this is Rolly.

15:48.083 --> 15:49.833
We're looking for Bob's mom.

15:49.833 --> 15:53.416
Sorry, there's no one
named "Bob's mom" here.

15:53.416 --> 15:55.166
This is a fire station.

15:55.166 --> 15:56.625
-Let's roll out, fellas!
-Roll out, everybody!

15:56.625 --> 15:58.583
And it looks like
it's time to go!

15:58.583 --> 15:59.625
Fireman:
Let's move it! Move it!

15:59.625 --> 16:01.125
Hey, you wanna ride with us?

16:01.125 --> 16:04.291
Can we look for a place
with a flag in front of it
while we do?

16:04.291 --> 16:05.583
Sure! Come on!

16:05.583 --> 16:08.250
We get to be firedogs,
Bingo, we get
to be firedogs!

16:08.250 --> 16:11.833
-(engine starts)
-Ah-roo!

16:11.833 --> 16:16.708
Ooh! Ooh!
Roo-roo-roo-roo-roo-roo!

16:16.708 --> 16:18.833
Rolly! The siren
isn't even on!

16:18.833 --> 16:20.250
Doesn't mean mine can't be!

Why are we stopping
at a restaurant?

17:07.291 --> 17:08.583
Is this where the fire is?

17:08.583 --> 17:12.458
We weren't goin' to a fire.
We were goin' to lunch!

17:12.458 --> 17:15.208
This place has two-for-one
corn dogs!

17:15.208 --> 17:16.166
(licking lips)

17:16.166 --> 17:18.458
Okay, we're still looking
for a place with a flag.

17:18.458 --> 17:19.500
Do you see one?

17:19.500 --> 17:22.833
No, but I do see
Cupcake and Rufus.

17:22.833 --> 17:26.291
Aw, man.
Why are they practically
everywhere we go?

17:26.291 --> 17:29.416
Well, if it isn't Bingo
and Rolly.

17:29.416 --> 17:31.375
Actually it is, so, ha!

17:31.375 --> 17:34.375
That thing under your collar
looks like it might be special.

17:34.375 --> 17:36.708
Maybe Rufus should
hold it for you.

17:36.708 --> 17:38.375
No. That's for Bob's mom.

17:38.375 --> 17:40.375
We're taking it somewhere
with a big flag in front,

17:40.375 --> 17:42.333
so she can have
a happy Mother's Day.

17:42.333 --> 17:44.291
And where do you think
you're gonna find some place

17:44.291 --> 17:46.333
with a big flag in front
around here?

17:46.333 --> 17:48.375
Oh. There's one.

17:50.708 --> 17:53.458
Thanks for the help, Cupcake.
Come on, Rolly!

17:53.458 --> 17:55.958
(grumbling)

18:00.250 --> 18:03.291
How come Bob's mom
has school desks,
and schoolbooks,

18:03.291 --> 18:05.875
and school art projects
all over the walls?

18:05.875 --> 18:08.833
Because I don't think
this is Bob's mom's house.

18:08.833 --> 18:10.083
I think it's a school!

18:10.083 --> 18:12.458
-(school bell rings)
Kids:
Recess!

18:12.458 --> 18:15.833
Rolly, if those kids see us,
they're gonna wanna
play with us.

18:15.833 --> 18:18.375
Well, can you blame 'em?
We're kind of adorable.

18:18.375 --> 18:19.833
But we don't have time
to play.

18:19.833 --> 18:21.833
So we'd better get out of here
before these kids see--

18:21.833 --> 18:23.416
Kids:
Puppies!

18:23.416 --> 18:24.625
Run!

18:24.625 --> 18:27.125
Let's tickle them!

18:27.125 --> 18:28.833
Sticky hands! Sticky hands!

18:28.833 --> 18:30.833
(children
all talking at once)

18:36.458 --> 18:40.583
Whooooa!

18:43.416 --> 18:46.166
Come on, Rolly!
We can get away!

18:46.166 --> 18:48.333
Well, you already have,
but I'm not so sure
about me!

18:48.333 --> 18:50.458
Faster, Rolly, come on!

18:50.458 --> 18:53.083
(panting)
Oh, why did I have
to be born so cute

18:53.083 --> 18:56.333
that every kid in the world
wants to play with me?

18:56.333 --> 18:58.458
Jump! You can make it! Jump!

18:58.458 --> 18:59.500
(grunts)

18:59.500 --> 19:00.708
I've got you!

19:00.708 --> 19:01.875
(grunting)

19:01.875 --> 19:03.208
I'm in!

19:03.208 --> 19:04.291
-Ah-rooo!
-Rolly, we're not
on a fire truck.

19:04.291 --> 19:05.458
We're in a bucket.

19:05.458 --> 19:07.416
Doesn't mean we can't
pretend we're on a fire truck.

19:07.416 --> 19:09.333
-That's true.
-Both:
Ah-rooooo!

19:09.333 --> 19:10.458
Are we still looking
for a flag?

19:10.458 --> 19:12.500
-Yeah!
-Cool! I think
I see one!

19:12.500 --> 19:16.000
Right on top of that pole
we're about to run into.

19:16.000 --> 19:18.291
(screaming)

19:18.291 --> 19:20.583
(screaming)

19:20.583 --> 19:23.625
(screaming)

19:30.750 --> 19:32.333
Ooh, I think we're okay.

19:32.333 --> 19:35.708
Yeah. Now let's go
inside this place,
and find Bob's mom.

19:35.708 --> 19:38.833
And when we do,
you can give this right to her.

19:38.833 --> 19:40.250
Special delivery!

19:45.583 --> 19:48.416
Well, this is a strange place
for Bob's mom to live.

19:48.416 --> 19:50.416
I don't think she lives here.

19:50.416 --> 19:51.875
I think this is the place
where they figure out

19:51.875 --> 19:54.291
where envelopes go
by reading what's written
on 'em.

19:54.291 --> 19:56.166
-Rolly, wait!
-Huh?

19:56.166 --> 19:58.875
-I'm waiting.
-Maybe it's not the flag
on the envelope

19:58.875 --> 20:01.500
that says where it goes,
maybe it's the writing!

20:01.500 --> 20:04.125
So if we had the envelope,
we could read where it goes?

20:04.125 --> 20:05.458
What do you mean,
"If we had it"?

20:05.458 --> 20:08.958
I kinda accidentally
dropped it when you yelled,
"Rolly, wait!"

20:08.958 --> 20:11.166
Rolly!

20:11.166 --> 20:14.000
We'll never find that card
in here.

20:14.000 --> 20:16.708
Yeah, it's, just gone.

20:16.708 --> 20:18.291
Wait, there it is!

20:20.500 --> 20:22.125
Follow that card!

20:24.833 --> 20:26.375
There it is! Over there!

20:26.375 --> 20:28.583
Where? I don't see it!

20:28.583 --> 20:30.708
-There! There!
-Where there?

20:34.000 --> 20:36.458
Both:
There it is!

20:36.458 --> 20:37.625
We've got it, Rolly!

20:39.000 --> 20:41.000
Oh, come on!

20:44.333 --> 20:45.583
(both grunting)

20:57.583 --> 21:01.625
-That card is in here somewhere!
We just have to find it!
-(doors slams shut)

21:01.625 --> 21:03.250
Uh, what just happened?

21:03.250 --> 21:05.708
I think they closed us
into the back of this truck.

21:05.708 --> 21:08.000
I didn't even know
we were in the back
of a truck.

21:17.708 --> 21:21.291
I don't know where we're going,
but we better find that card
for Bob's mom

21:21.291 --> 21:23.291
before we get there.

21:23.291 --> 21:24.416
Ooh, a pet store catalog.

21:26.416 --> 21:27.625
Ooh, a dog food catalog!

21:29.208 --> 21:30.875
Ooh, a fire hydrant catalog!

21:30.875 --> 21:33.208
Rolly, none of that
is what we're looking for.

21:33.208 --> 21:36.833
I know, I'm just figuring out
what I should ask for
for my birthday.

21:36.833 --> 21:38.416
I found it!

21:38.416 --> 21:40.000
Great job, Rolly!

21:40.000 --> 21:42.583
Now we just need to wait
for the truck to stop
so we can--

21:42.583 --> 21:44.458
Both:
Whoooa!

21:44.458 --> 21:45.500
(door opening)

21:50.458 --> 21:51.875
-Where are we?
-I don't know.

21:51.875 --> 21:54.458
Maybe we should ask
Bob's mom.

21:54.458 --> 21:56.458
Rolly! We found her!

21:56.458 --> 21:59.375
And she looks as happy
as she does in the picture
at Bob's house.

21:59.375 --> 22:01.583
But our mission
is to get this card
into her mailbox

22:01.583 --> 22:03.583
and make her extra-super-happy.

22:03.583 --> 22:04.750
So here's what we're gonna do.

22:04.750 --> 22:06.875
We'll crawl on our bellies
to that bush,

22:06.875 --> 22:08.708
then climb up the fence
like it's a tree,

22:08.708 --> 22:10.625
then we'll tightrope
across the clothesline,

22:10.625 --> 22:12.500
do a somersault,
bite the end of the rope

22:12.500 --> 22:15.166
and swing through the air,
landing on top
of the mailbox,

22:15.166 --> 22:17.458
which is when you'll
open the door with your teeth,

22:17.458 --> 22:18.708
and I'll drop in the letter.

22:18.708 --> 22:20.000
Or...

22:24.708 --> 22:26.500
I did it!
I completed
our mission!

22:26.500 --> 22:28.083
My way would've worked, too!

22:30.750 --> 22:32.375
And then we rode
on a fire engine,

22:32.375 --> 22:33.500
and then we rode
in a bucket,

22:33.500 --> 22:35.000
and then we rode in a truck!

22:35.000 --> 22:37.625
What'd you do
while we were
delivering the mail, Hissy?

22:37.625 --> 22:40.875
Mostly, I wiped
Arf's runny noise.

22:40.875 --> 22:44.000
-(electronic sound)
-Which just wouldn't
stop running.

22:44.000 --> 22:45.000
Thanks.

22:45.000 --> 22:48.875
(rattling ringing tone)

22:51.208 --> 22:52.625
Hello?

22:52.625 --> 22:54.625
Oh! Hi, Mom!

22:54.625 --> 22:56.583
You got the Mother's Day card?

22:56.583 --> 22:58.125
Oh, that's great!

22:58.125 --> 23:00.166
Teeth marks on the envelope?

23:00.166 --> 23:02.375
Well, I don't know
how that happened.

23:02.375 --> 23:04.583
Sure, you wanna talk to them?

23:04.583 --> 23:09.333
Mom asked if she could speak
with the little puppy wuppies.

23:09.333 --> 23:10.708
(dogs barking)

23:10.708 --> 23:11.708
Hi, Bob's mom!

23:11.708 --> 23:13.125
Did you like the card?
We were the ones

23:13.125 --> 23:14.458
who delivered it to you!

23:14.458 --> 23:15.583
(dogs barking)

23:15.583 --> 23:18.458
(laughing)
Aren't they funny?

23:18.458 --> 23:20.250
They just go,
"Ruff, ruff,"

23:20.250 --> 23:22.958
but sometimes it's like
they're actually talking.

23:22.958 --> 23:24.291
(dogs barking)

23:24.291 --> 23:26.583
Happy Mother's Day, Mom.
