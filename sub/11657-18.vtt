00:41.600 --> 00:44.600
(mellow music playing)

00:56.000 --> 00:58.367
(Dorothy) I'm ok. I am ok.

00:58.433 --> 00:59.800
-Ok.
-Just don't step too hard.

01:00.667 --> 01:01.600
Just sit down on the sofa.

01:02.233 --> 01:04.767
Oh, my God! What is it? What happened?

01:04.834 --> 01:06.300
Nothing, nothing, Ma.

01:06.367 --> 01:07.600
Don't worry. I'm just fine.

01:07.667 --> 01:10.700
Yeah, it's nothing serious.
Probably just a pulled muscle.

01:10.767 --> 01:12.000
It happened in class

01:12.066 --> 01:15.934
when she tried to do a six-count
Cincinnati riff with a double pullback.

01:17.734 --> 01:19.133
Goes something like this.

01:25.967 --> 01:28.967
Margaret Weinstein did the same thing
when they changed her medication.

01:31.333 --> 01:34.233
Do you think she could take
Dorothy's place in the recital?

01:34.300 --> 01:37.333
Oh, come on, honey. I'll
be fine by next week.

01:37.400 --> 01:39.100
Maybe you should have it checked
by a doctor.

01:39.166 --> 01:39.867
Oh, come on.

01:39.934 --> 01:42.033
It's a very simple thing
that comes and goes.

01:42.100 --> 01:43.233
I've had it for years.

01:43.300 --> 01:46.033
I probably overdid it in class tonight.

01:46.100 --> 01:47.767
I do think you ought to have it
checked out.

01:47.834 --> 01:49.266
It's perfectly all right.

01:49.333 --> 01:50.600
Ma, what is that you're knitting?

01:50.667 --> 01:52.433
A bottle cover for the sherry.

01:55.934 --> 01:57.567
Why do we need to cover the sherry?

01:57.633 --> 02:01.367
Not the sherry here in the house.
The sherry I take to the park.

02:01.433 --> 02:05.133
You drink out of a paper bag in the park,
and suddenly, everybody's your friend.

02:07.700 --> 02:11.300
Oh, Sophia, I don't think
it's a good idea to drink in the park.

02:11.367 --> 02:14.467
Hey, I do it once a month
with the girls from the cloud society.

02:14.533 --> 02:16.367
The cloud society?

02:16.433 --> 02:19.700
Yeah, we stake out a bench,
knock a few sherries back

02:19.767 --> 02:21.734
and discuss what we think
the clouds look like.

02:24.533 --> 02:29.200
One afternoon, I thought I saw Pat Sajak
riding sidesaddle on a dolphin.

02:32.000 --> 02:33.266
I'm gonna get something to eat.

02:33.333 --> 02:36.300
Oh, yeah, good idea.
There's that salad in the fridge.

02:36.367 --> 02:37.200
Sophia?

02:37.266 --> 02:38.567
No. I have to finish this.

02:38.967 --> 02:40.700
Knit one, purl two.

02:40.767 --> 02:42.800
5, 6, 7, 8.

02:49.500 --> 02:50.567
Knock it off, Rose.

02:52.567 --> 02:55.767
It's just that I've always dreamed
about learning to tap dance,

02:55.834 --> 02:58.533
and I guess I get too gung ho
about things.

02:59.133 --> 03:00.100
When I was a child,

03:00.166 --> 03:03.133
I used to get overexcited
and pet the cat too hard.

03:07.367 --> 03:09.100
-Ooh, oh!
-Oh, what is it?

03:09.166 --> 03:12.266
Nothing, nothing, nothing!
I'm all right. I'm fine.

03:12.333 --> 03:15.166
No, you are not,
and I'm tired of watching you suffer.

03:15.233 --> 03:17.734
That's what daddy said
to our horse, old Toby,

03:17.800 --> 03:18.967
when he broke his leg.

03:21.867 --> 03:23.066
Then he shot him.

03:25.266 --> 03:28.266
Your family was awfully tough on pets,
weren't they, Rose?

03:29.200 --> 03:31.266
Dorothy, this could be more serious
than you think.

03:31.333 --> 03:33.233
Now, why don't you have a doctor
look at that foot?

03:33.300 --> 03:34.500
I already have.

03:34.567 --> 03:36.667
-When?
-1965.

03:38.467 --> 03:40.000
You don't want to miss the recital.

03:40.066 --> 03:42.400
-I... It is fine.
-Oh, really?

03:42.467 --> 03:44.900
Let's see you do a Cincinnati time step.

03:44.967 --> 03:45.734
Fine.

03:46.867 --> 03:47.533
And...

03:47.600 --> 03:48.266
Ooh!

03:48.333 --> 03:49.500
Oh, honey.

03:49.567 --> 03:53.433
Oh, all right, all right, I'll go...

03:54.266 --> 03:55.734
For the sake of the act.

03:57.767 --> 03:59.700
If you really wanna do something
for the sake of the act,

03:59.767 --> 04:01.967
have one of those two left feet
made into a right one.

04:02.033 --> 04:03.367
(laughs)

04:05.567 --> 04:08.567
(piano music playing)

04:24.734 --> 04:25.600
Rose.

04:30.900 --> 04:31.600
Blanche.

04:36.300 --> 04:37.100
Dorothy.

04:37.600 --> 04:39.100
Go, Dorothy, go.

04:49.800 --> 04:52.500
Gosh, I didn't realize
how long Dorothy's solo is.

04:55.300 --> 04:57.600
I sure hope the doctor says
she's gonna be all right.

04:58.333 --> 04:59.467
Hoo.

05:02.900 --> 05:04.567
(music ends)

05:08.166 --> 05:10.033
I won't dance. Don't ask me.

05:11.867 --> 05:14.667
-Oh, my God.
-(Blanche) Dorothy, are you all right?

05:14.734 --> 05:17.367
Honey, it's not as bad as it looks.

05:17.433 --> 05:18.767
The doctor says I'm fine.

05:18.834 --> 05:21.900
Just have to take it a little easy
for a few days, that's all.

05:22.433 --> 05:23.367
You're lying.

05:23.433 --> 05:25.934
Oh, Sophia, Dorothy wouldn't lie.

05:26.000 --> 05:29.133
A mother knows when her child is lying.
It's like bat radar.

05:30.400 --> 05:32.100
Now, what did the doctor really say?

05:32.467 --> 05:35.100
-He said I have to have surgery.
-Surgery?

05:35.166 --> 05:35.834
For what?

05:35.900 --> 05:37.567
For kicks, Rose.

05:39.300 --> 05:42.767
No, I have a condition called
Morton's neuroma.

05:42.834 --> 05:45.400
Oh, I think I had that once.

05:45.934 --> 05:47.967
How the heck did you ever catch it
in your foot?

05:55.100 --> 05:56.900
It's a very small tumor, Ma.

05:56.967 --> 05:58.800
I've had it for about 20 years.

05:58.867 --> 06:00.934
-A tumor? It sounds serious.
-No, no, no.

06:01.000 --> 06:02.533
It's a very simple surgical procedure.

06:02.600 --> 06:05.133
As a matter of fact,
I'd only be in the hospital overnight.

06:05.567 --> 06:06.934
-That's it?
-That's it.

06:07.000 --> 06:08.400
Oh, what a relief.

06:08.467 --> 06:09.667
So, when you gonna have the surgery?

06:09.734 --> 06:10.567
Never.

06:12.700 --> 06:15.667
Honey, you just now said yourself
it's a very simple procedure.

06:15.734 --> 06:17.867
Oh, it is, for the doctor.

06:18.300 --> 06:21.100
But it happens to be my foot
that he wants to cut open.

06:22.300 --> 06:24.433
So, you intend to limp around in pain

06:24.500 --> 06:27.166
when you could be completely cured
in just one night?

06:27.233 --> 06:28.400
Dorothy, that doesn't make sense.

06:28.467 --> 06:30.166
It makes sense to me.

06:30.233 --> 06:31.667
I don't like doctors.

06:31.734 --> 06:33.233
I don't like hospitals.

06:33.300 --> 06:37.166
Nobody likes hospitals,
but there's nothing to be scared of.

06:37.233 --> 06:38.467
Oh, really, Rose?

06:38.533 --> 06:39.700
What about blood?

06:39.767 --> 06:40.867
What about death?

06:40.934 --> 06:43.667
What about those nighties
that don't close up in the back?

06:45.967 --> 06:48.066
Well, anybody can make it
sound unpleasant.

06:48.567 --> 06:50.667
Dorothy, you are being irrational.

06:50.734 --> 06:53.567
Now, the bottom line is
we're talking about your health.

06:53.633 --> 06:55.967
That is a very precious thing.

06:56.033 --> 07:00.166
The longer you put this surgery off,
the more you may be risking your health.

07:00.233 --> 07:03.433
I just don't think
that's a risk worth taking, do you?

07:04.000 --> 07:04.667
Yes.

07:06.333 --> 07:09.266
Fine. Don't have the surgery.
Let me suffer.

07:09.333 --> 07:11.333
Ma, it's my foot.

07:11.400 --> 07:13.533
Your foot? My heart.

07:14.367 --> 07:16.500
Do you have any idea
how much a mother suffers

07:16.567 --> 07:17.767
when she sees her child in pain?

07:17.834 --> 07:19.300
Look, Ma, don't do this.

07:19.367 --> 07:20.367
I'll tell you how much.

07:20.433 --> 07:22.500
Worse than the 23 hours of labor
it took...

07:22.567 --> 07:24.166
(both) ...to bring you into this world.

07:24.233 --> 07:27.633
Worse than the burns I got
working nights as a fry cook

07:27.700 --> 07:28.967
to help put you through college.

07:29.300 --> 07:30.333
Worse than the time...

07:30.400 --> 07:31.734
All right, all right, Ma.

07:33.233 --> 07:34.400
I'll have the surgery.

07:34.867 --> 07:35.633
You win.

07:35.700 --> 07:37.900
You always win, but you don't play fair.

07:38.367 --> 07:39.767
That's why I always win.

07:41.600 --> 07:44.600
(mellow music playing)

07:47.066 --> 07:49.700
I don't know what you have been
complaining about, Dorothy.

07:49.767 --> 07:53.233
I think this is a very good hospital
and a perfectly lovely room.

07:53.300 --> 07:55.166
Isn't it a lovely room, Rose?

07:55.633 --> 07:56.734
Very lovely.

07:57.433 --> 08:00.700
I just keep wondering how many people
have never left this room.

08:04.533 --> 08:06.967
Where are they, Rose,
hiding in the shower?

08:08.800 --> 08:11.367
She means a lot of people
have probably croaked in here.

08:12.367 --> 08:14.266
I know what she means, Ma.

08:14.333 --> 08:16.633
I just don't need to hear it
the night before surgery.

08:16.700 --> 08:19.133
Come on, don't be such a baby.

08:19.200 --> 08:21.500
I had my appendix out
in a hospital in Sicily.

08:21.567 --> 08:22.767
That was rough.

08:24.300 --> 08:25.000
Why?

08:25.066 --> 08:27.867
They didn't believe in anesthesia
back then.

08:28.133 --> 08:30.467
They had a nurse hold a pillow
over your face

08:32.200 --> 08:34.433
so the other patients
couldn't hear your screams.

08:36.166 --> 08:38.066
You had to pay extra for that.

08:40.333 --> 08:42.033
Sicily, love it or leave it.

08:43.266 --> 08:46.200
Visiting hours are over, ladies.
Everybody will have to leave.

08:46.667 --> 08:48.166
Whoa, where do you think you're going?

08:49.400 --> 08:50.667
You said everybody.

08:51.133 --> 08:52.133
Get back in bed.

08:52.900 --> 08:54.934
Take care, darling.

08:55.000 --> 08:55.967
(smooches)
Bye-bye.

08:56.266 --> 08:57.800
Good night, pussycat.

08:58.867 --> 09:00.600
We'll see you first thing
in the morning, honey.

09:01.000 --> 09:03.233
I hope I can say the same thing.

09:12.900 --> 09:15.800
Hello, Mrs. Zbornak.
My name is Dr. Revell.

09:15.867 --> 09:16.700
Oh, hello.

09:16.767 --> 09:17.934
I'm here to tell you

09:18.000 --> 09:21.066
Dr. Ashton won't be able to perform
your surgery tomorrow.

09:21.133 --> 09:22.900
He's been subpoenaed
in a malpractice suit.

09:31.467 --> 09:32.500
You are kidding?

09:32.567 --> 09:33.700
I'm afraid not.

09:34.233 --> 09:36.100
He's a damn fine doctor, too.

09:36.166 --> 09:37.867
I wish I were half the doctor he is.

09:41.133 --> 09:43.633
By the way, I'll be performing
your surgery tomorrow.

09:45.300 --> 09:48.367
Look, couldn't this surgery wait
until he gets back?

09:48.433 --> 09:51.333
If he gets a hostile jury,
you may have to wait three to five years.

09:52.900 --> 09:55.834
You'd be surprised how peeved
people get nowadays

09:55.900 --> 09:57.467
over any little mix-up.

09:58.500 --> 09:59.333
Mix-up?

10:00.200 --> 10:01.400
I didn't say mix-up...

10:02.233 --> 10:03.700
And there's no one here
to prove that I did.

10:05.266 --> 10:07.700
Now, if you'll sign these forms,
we'll be all set.

10:07.767 --> 10:08.900
Forms?

10:08.967 --> 10:11.233
Oh, they're just your standard
consent forms releasing us

10:11.300 --> 10:13.467
from all liability
in the unlikely event of your death.

10:14.433 --> 10:18.000
I'm having a simple operation.
How could I possibly die?

10:18.066 --> 10:19.433
Oh, it's possible, believe me.

10:23.400 --> 10:25.000
Just ask Dr. Ashton.

10:25.066 --> 10:25.934
(laughs)

10:26.500 --> 10:30.266
Listen, you know, I really don't think
this operation is a good idea.

10:30.333 --> 10:33.166
Mrs. Zbornak, relax.
You have nothing to worry about.

10:33.233 --> 10:36.367
It's a simple surgical procedure.
I'm sure everything will be fine.

10:36.900 --> 10:37.633
Here.

10:37.700 --> 10:39.867
I'll leave these forms
so you can look them over,

10:39.934 --> 10:42.100
and I'll see you in the morning
when I get back from court.

10:42.166 --> 10:45.600
Wait a minute.
I wanna hear more about this mix-up.

10:45.667 --> 10:47.066
I don't know what you're talking about.

10:47.734 --> 10:48.400
'Night.

10:51.567 --> 10:52.233
(door closes)

11:29.266 --> 11:30.433
What do you think you're doing?

11:30.500 --> 11:33.367
I'm giving you the last rites,
Mr. Ferguson.

11:35.100 --> 11:37.000
I'm not Mr. Ferguson.

11:37.066 --> 11:38.900
Then what are you doing in bed with him?

11:41.000 --> 11:43.000
The man's dying, for God's sake.

11:43.467 --> 11:46.533
Wait a minute.
There is no Mr. Ferguson in this room.

11:46.600 --> 11:47.834
Isn't this room 203?

11:47.900 --> 11:49.300
303.

11:49.367 --> 11:51.934
Ha-ha. Oh, boy, what a day.

11:54.367 --> 11:57.066
Since I'm here,
do you need the last rites?

11:57.133 --> 11:58.166
No, thank you.

11:59.100 --> 12:00.233
Have you had your operation yet?

12:00.300 --> 12:01.533
No, tomorrow morning.

12:01.600 --> 12:02.600
Well, good luck.

12:03.033 --> 12:04.700
I'm sure everything will be fine.

12:05.233 --> 12:09.700
But just to be on the safe side,
I'll swing by here tomorrow afternoon.

12:31.667 --> 12:32.367
Dorothy?

12:32.834 --> 12:33.900
Yes, Blanche?

12:33.967 --> 12:37.033
What are you doing out there?

12:37.100 --> 12:38.934
Checking the sprinkler system.

12:41.300 --> 12:42.900
Looks good. Good night.

12:42.967 --> 12:44.734
You get yourself in here.

12:44.800 --> 12:45.633
Get in here.

12:46.233 --> 12:48.400
Where in the world did you come from?

12:48.967 --> 12:50.900
The coffee shop at the bus station.

12:52.633 --> 12:55.667
I went there from the hospital
to, you know, think things out.

12:56.133 --> 12:59.333
But this toothless old wino
who claimed he was Elvis

12:59.400 --> 13:01.967
kept hounding me
for bus fare to Graceland.

13:03.367 --> 13:04.667
So, I came home.

13:04.734 --> 13:06.033
Blanche, call the police.

13:06.100 --> 13:08.367
I just saw a big, ugly man
with a limp walk

13:08.433 --> 13:09.800
past my bedroom window.

13:10.700 --> 13:12.600
He was wearing Dorothy's coat.

13:15.367 --> 13:18.500
But then again, it was dark,
and I tend to overdramatize.

13:19.734 --> 13:21.200
What are you doing home?

13:21.266 --> 13:22.400
She snuck out of the hospital.

13:22.467 --> 13:24.100
She's too scared to have her operation.

13:24.166 --> 13:26.066
-Dorothy.
-Look, I couldn't help it.

13:26.133 --> 13:28.500
When the doctor came in
with the release form,

13:28.567 --> 13:30.400
he told me what could possibly go wrong.

13:30.467 --> 13:31.333
I just panicked.

13:31.400 --> 13:33.500
Darling, nothing is going to go wrong.

13:33.567 --> 13:35.300
Blanche is right.

13:36.033 --> 13:38.600
'Course, one summer,
when I was a candy striper,

13:38.667 --> 13:40.600
you wouldn't believe the things I saw.

13:41.400 --> 13:45.500
Lost patients, mixed-up medications,
botched operations...

13:45.567 --> 13:49.500
Rose, do a big, ugly man
with a limp a favor and shut up.

13:51.900 --> 13:54.700
Dorothy, nobody likes
being in the hospital,

13:54.767 --> 13:58.033
-but it's natural to be afraid.
-She's right, darlin'.

13:58.100 --> 14:00.033
Everybody has fears.

14:00.100 --> 14:03.467
Now, all of my life,
I had an incredible fear of flying.

14:03.533 --> 14:06.467
And I missed out on a lot of things
because of that fear.

14:06.834 --> 14:08.867
-Then, one day--
-No, don't tell me.

14:08.934 --> 14:10.867
You met a handsome pilot.

14:10.934 --> 14:12.934
He invited you into the cockpit.

14:13.000 --> 14:16.200
Of course, you said yes,
as you usually do in these stories,

14:16.266 --> 14:18.500
the two of you made passionate love,

14:18.567 --> 14:21.667
and now you cannot get enough
of the friendly skies.

14:22.700 --> 14:24.533
No, that's not what happened at all.

14:25.767 --> 14:27.233
Then how did you get over your fear?

14:27.300 --> 14:30.200
I never did, but thanks to Dorothy,
I now have new hope.

14:32.133 --> 14:33.767
You see, Dorothy?

14:33.834 --> 14:36.400
Blanche is willing to face her fear.

14:36.467 --> 14:38.233
I think it's time you faced yours.

14:38.300 --> 14:39.934
Look, Rose, forget it.

14:40.000 --> 14:41.900
I am not going to have that surgery,

14:41.967 --> 14:44.233
and no one is going to make me
change my mind.

14:44.300 --> 14:47.033
I thought I heard you in here.
What are you doing home?

14:47.100 --> 14:48.166
I'm all better, Ma.

14:48.233 --> 14:49.467
Oh, she is not.

14:49.533 --> 14:52.500
She's afraid to have the surgery
because she has a phobia about hospitals.

14:52.567 --> 14:54.567
And do you know why I have that phobia?

14:54.633 --> 14:58.667
Because when I was five years old,
I was left alone in the hospital

14:58.734 --> 15:01.333
on the day I was having
my tonsils taken out.

15:01.400 --> 15:04.066
I was in Cleveland
at your Uncle Mario's funeral.

15:04.133 --> 15:05.734
Yeah, but pop wasn't.

15:05.800 --> 15:08.166
Of course not. He hated your Uncle Mario.

15:08.233 --> 15:10.066
Everyone hated your Uncle Mario.

15:10.133 --> 15:11.400
That's how he died,

15:11.467 --> 15:14.900
23 stab wounds during a block party,
and nobody saw a thing.

15:17.767 --> 15:21.967
Pop left a scared, sick five-year-old
all alone at the hospital.

15:22.033 --> 15:23.400
Said he had to go to work.

15:23.467 --> 15:24.633
He did have to go to work.

15:24.700 --> 15:26.834
How else could we have paid
for the operation?

15:27.200 --> 15:31.934
All I know is, I was alone and terrified,
and I have never gotten over it.

15:32.000 --> 15:34.333
I still have that phobia about hospitals.

15:34.400 --> 15:36.066
It's about time you got over it.

15:36.133 --> 15:39.000
Blanche, get the keys to your car.
We're taking Dorothy back to the hospital.

15:39.066 --> 15:40.400
Ma, I am not going.

15:40.867 --> 15:43.467
Okey, fine.
You don't want to go back to the hospital?

15:43.533 --> 15:44.200
No.

15:44.266 --> 15:45.633
-You don't want the doctor to operate?
-No.

15:45.700 --> 15:47.967
Then it's settled. We'll do it here.

15:49.633 --> 15:52.033
Blanche, go boil some water
and get me a pillow.

15:52.467 --> 15:54.533
Rose, sharpen my Ginsu knife.

15:56.100 --> 15:58.734
Dorothy, pick out a shoe
you'd like to bite on.

16:00.033 --> 16:01.667
You're not serious?

16:01.734 --> 16:04.734
No, I'm just acting as stupid as you are.

16:06.633 --> 16:07.300
All right.

16:08.667 --> 16:11.266
All right, I'll go back.

16:11.834 --> 16:14.266
-Oh, you always win, don't you?
-Yep.

16:14.333 --> 16:16.967
-You're awfully good at this.
-I'm the best.

16:22.734 --> 16:23.567
Ok, here we are.

16:23.633 --> 16:25.967
How come I get the chair
with the wobbly wheels?

16:26.033 --> 16:28.200
Oh, looks like you have a new roommate.

16:28.266 --> 16:29.433
Hi. I'm bonnie.

16:29.500 --> 16:31.133
Dorothy. Glad to meet you.

16:31.200 --> 16:33.033
Now, are my tests finished?

16:33.100 --> 16:36.767
I am tired of being probed,
poked and prodded.

16:37.367 --> 16:40.934
More men have seen my behind
in one day than in my entire life.

16:42.367 --> 16:45.633
They'll be in to prep you for surgery
in about an hour.

16:45.700 --> 16:46.767
Until then, just relax.

16:46.834 --> 16:49.367
There aren't enough drugs
in the entire building.

16:50.367 --> 16:52.600
I hope my exercising doesn't bother you.

16:52.667 --> 16:53.567
No, not at all.

16:53.633 --> 16:55.633
What is it, some therapy you have to do?

16:55.700 --> 16:57.500
No. I just like to stay healthy.

16:58.066 --> 17:00.500
I hate to break this to you, Bonnie.
You're in a hospital.

17:00.567 --> 17:02.100
The exercises aren't working.

17:05.967 --> 17:07.166
Surgery today, huh?

17:07.700 --> 17:09.367
Yeah. And I might as well warn you,

17:09.433 --> 17:11.633
I am not the best patient
in the whole world.

17:11.700 --> 17:13.600
I can put up with you for one night.

17:13.667 --> 17:16.266
Then tomorrow,
it is my turn in the operating room.

17:17.200 --> 17:18.233
Oh, you're having surgery, too?

17:18.300 --> 17:19.033
Yeah.

17:19.100 --> 17:20.467
And you're smiling?

17:20.533 --> 17:22.367
I've had this procedure before.

17:22.433 --> 17:24.333
The first time,
I was as nervous as you are.

17:24.400 --> 17:25.934
This time, I know what to expect.

17:26.000 --> 17:28.700
You're having the same operation again?

17:29.300 --> 17:31.900
Don't they get it right around here
the first time?

17:33.000 --> 17:34.600
Oh, no, it's nothing like that.

17:35.100 --> 17:37.266
About three years ago, I had a mastectomy.

17:37.333 --> 17:39.533
And, well, now I'm in for another.

17:40.200 --> 17:41.600
And you're not scared?

17:41.667 --> 17:43.100
I'm petrified.

17:43.567 --> 17:46.700
No one's that brave,
except in the movies and on television.

17:46.767 --> 17:48.834
But at least this time,
I know what I'm facing.

17:49.467 --> 17:51.367
I've gone through all the steps before.

17:51.433 --> 17:55.300
I have considered the alternatives,
dealt with the reality.

17:55.700 --> 17:57.000
The last time, I...

17:57.066 --> 17:59.633
I think I started crying
the moment the doctor told me,

17:59.700 --> 18:01.867
and I didn't stop
till they wheeled me off to surgery.

18:01.934 --> 18:04.800
And then, later,
I cried because there was so much pain,

18:04.867 --> 18:09.000
I didn't think it would ever go away,
but it did, and it will again.

18:09.834 --> 18:10.867
You get through it.

18:11.867 --> 18:12.867
You go on.

18:13.767 --> 18:16.667
When it comes right down to it,
what other choice do we have?

18:17.200 --> 18:18.233
It could have been a lot worse.

18:18.300 --> 18:20.333
I could have missed
these last three years.

18:23.000 --> 18:24.333
Dorothy, are you all right?

18:26.000 --> 18:26.867
How do you feel?

18:27.500 --> 18:28.867
Like a fool.

18:30.967 --> 18:32.567
Like a damn fool.

18:34.934 --> 18:37.934
(somber music playing)

18:45.734 --> 18:49.200
Ok, Blanche, let's go. I found your shoes.
They were under Sophia's mattress.

18:49.266 --> 18:52.367
Oh, I didn't think
you'd find them that fast.

18:57.200 --> 18:58.400
What's going on, Blanche?

18:58.900 --> 19:00.333
My foot hurts.

19:00.400 --> 19:02.133
I think I caught what Dorothy's got.

19:03.700 --> 19:06.266
You can't catch what Dorothy has.

19:06.333 --> 19:09.734
Well, then it must just be sympathy pains.
Ooh.

19:10.433 --> 19:12.934
Blanche, we're gonna be late.
Now come on, let's go.

19:13.000 --> 19:15.433
No, I don't think we ought
to dance tonight, Rose.

19:15.500 --> 19:16.333
It's just not right.

19:16.400 --> 19:18.667
Now, we ought to be down
at that hospital with Dorothy.

19:18.734 --> 19:20.333
Sophia's with her.

19:20.400 --> 19:22.400
She's out of surgery, and she's fine.

19:22.467 --> 19:23.800
Now come on, let's go.

19:23.867 --> 19:25.967
Rose, I have a confession to make.

19:26.734 --> 19:28.934
Flying isn't the only thing I'm afraid of.

19:29.667 --> 19:31.600
I also have a fear of performing.

19:32.400 --> 19:33.800
In front of groups, that is.

19:40.300 --> 19:42.400
I thought you went to dancing school.

19:42.467 --> 19:43.333
Oh, that was different.

19:43.400 --> 19:46.200
That was partner dancing,
up close and personal.

19:47.600 --> 19:49.233
Rose, what I didn't tell you was,

19:49.867 --> 19:53.200
when I was five,
mama enrolled me in a tap-dancing class.

19:53.834 --> 19:55.834
For six months, we practiced,

19:55.900 --> 19:58.000
one hour a day, two days a week.

19:58.066 --> 19:59.300
And I was good.

19:59.367 --> 20:03.133
I was cute, and I was good, real good.

20:03.734 --> 20:06.934
And then, finally, it came time
for the night of the recital.

20:07.567 --> 20:11.333
And there were 13 little girls up there
with our little Shirley temple curls

20:11.400 --> 20:15.967
and our little starched-white pinafores
and our little Mary Jane shoes.

20:17.066 --> 20:18.667
Then they opened the curtain,

20:18.734 --> 20:22.700
and the music started,
and 12 little girls started to dance.

20:25.867 --> 20:27.467
And one little girl wet her pants.

20:32.200 --> 20:33.633
That girl in the puddle was me.

20:35.233 --> 20:36.567
Oh, God,

20:37.834 --> 20:41.333
I have never told that
to another living soul, Rose.

20:41.967 --> 20:44.600
You see, I thought I had overcome
my fear, honey,

20:44.667 --> 20:48.900
but I just haven't, and...
And performing is a nightmare for me.

20:50.000 --> 20:52.500
Hey, we've all got our sad stories.

20:53.467 --> 20:54.200
What?

20:54.266 --> 20:57.200
Look, Blanche,
we've practiced for six weeks.

20:57.266 --> 21:00.500
We've paid for our costumes,
we told everybody we'd be there.

21:00.567 --> 21:02.266
Now, you're not gonna wimp out on me.

21:02.333 --> 21:03.700
You're gonna go to that recital.

21:03.767 --> 21:05.633
And if you end up in a puddle tonight,

21:05.700 --> 21:08.967
you'd just better break
into "Singin' In The Rain."

21:11.266 --> 21:14.266
(mellow music playing)

21:22.133 --> 21:23.700
-Ma?
-What?

21:26.700 --> 21:28.066
What are you doing here?

21:28.800 --> 21:32.066
You were operated on. You're my daughter.
Where else would I be?

21:33.433 --> 21:34.867
How long have you been here?

21:34.934 --> 21:36.333
Since they took you to surgery.

21:36.400 --> 21:38.467
I haven't left the room,
not for a newspaper,

21:38.533 --> 21:40.633
not for food, not for a cold drink.

21:40.700 --> 21:42.400
All day, I've been right here.

21:42.467 --> 21:43.433
Oh, Ma.

21:43.867 --> 21:45.367
Ma, I love you.

21:46.233 --> 21:48.767
Could you fluff up my pillow a little,
please?

21:48.834 --> 21:50.433
What, I look like an orderly?

21:52.266 --> 21:55.300
Push the button, wake up a nurse.
I'm just here for moral support.

21:56.800 --> 21:58.934
I already got that from my roommate.

22:00.233 --> 22:01.667
Oh, she's gone.

22:02.200 --> 22:03.800
And I never thanked her.

22:04.233 --> 22:06.367
Relax. She's not the lone ranger.
She'll be back.

22:06.433 --> 22:08.800
I sent her to the cafeteria
to get me a sandwich.

22:10.867 --> 22:12.600
Hello.

22:12.667 --> 22:14.600
Hi. How are you feeling?

22:14.667 --> 22:16.033
I'm exhausted.

22:19.033 --> 22:21.934
-How's our little patient doing?
-Ah, fine, just fine.

22:22.000 --> 22:23.867
A little groggy, that's all.

22:23.934 --> 22:25.633
But you're not in any pain?

22:25.700 --> 22:27.567
Slight discomfort.

22:27.633 --> 22:30.533
You want discomfort?
Try sitting in this chair for eight hours.

22:34.266 --> 22:36.000
How was the dance recital?

22:36.066 --> 22:37.300
-Oh.
-We were great.

22:37.367 --> 22:39.033
They loved us.

22:39.100 --> 22:42.367
We've been invited to dance next month
at the sunset charity ball.

22:43.200 --> 22:45.433
There's even some talk
about us going up to Palm Beach

22:45.500 --> 22:46.433
to be in the cotillion.

22:46.500 --> 22:48.567
Oh, that's wonderful.

22:48.633 --> 22:51.667
And I'll be back in dancing shape by then.

22:51.734 --> 22:52.633
Uh...

22:53.233 --> 22:56.667
Well, you don't understand.
We've changed our act.

22:56.734 --> 22:59.166
We're no longer the tip tap trio.

22:59.233 --> 23:01.433
Oh?
Who are we now?

23:01.500 --> 23:04.133
Well, we're now known as...

23:04.200 --> 23:06.166
(both) The Two Merry Widows.

23:10.333 --> 23:11.300
(Rose) Hit it, Blanche.

23:11.367 --> 23:16.266
(piano intro)

23:18.200 --> 23:21.200
("Tea For Two" playing)

23:51.166 --> 23:52.533
(music ends)

23:54.834 --> 23:59.066
Oh, that was the most adorable dance
I think I've ever seen.

23:59.133 --> 23:59.867
(giggling)
