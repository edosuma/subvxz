00:00.066 --> 00:01.567
<i>Previously on The Client List...</i>

00:01.569 --> 00:02.668
I'm home. Welcome home.

00:02.670 --> 00:06.138
<i>Sean Foster, the guy
that attacked Lacey...</i>

00:06.140 --> 00:07.705
I think he wanted the list.

00:07.708 --> 00:09.375
The baby?
- We're gonna try again.

00:09.377 --> 00:11.210
Dale and I decided
to look into adoption.

00:11.212 --> 00:13.445
Officer Parks, this Texas Rangers badge

00:13.447 --> 00:15.347
gives you jurisdiction all over Texas.

00:15.349 --> 00:16.849
I'll make detective on my own.
- I know that.

00:16.851 --> 00:20.386
Texas Rangers picked me to be
part of an elite undercover unit.

00:20.388 --> 00:21.153
Trafficking, prostitution.

00:21.155 --> 00:24.056
With this man overseeing
things, what could go wrong?

00:24.058 --> 00:24.757
You are setting me up.

00:24.759 --> 00:27.259
Every move they make, I'm gonna
know about it. I've got your back.

00:27.261 --> 00:28.427
Do you have mine?
- I always do.

00:28.429 --> 00:31.196
Mr. Carlyle, have you met
my friend, Detective Monroe?

00:31.197 --> 00:32.164
Nikki was just coming with me.

00:32.165 --> 00:34.133
I miss you, baby. I miss this.

00:34.135 --> 00:36.135
<i>Now you just need
to get me that list.</i>

00:36.137 --> 00:37.770
Someone trashed Riley's office.

00:37.772 --> 00:39.538
I told you I would get you the list.

00:39.540 --> 00:41.540
You didn't think I could
smell the deception?

00:41.542 --> 00:42.274
Get out!

00:42.276 --> 00:45.044
<i>If anything happens to the list...
- Georgia, I got it.</i>

02:03.924 --> 02:05.891
Hey, so...

02:06.826 --> 02:09.495
If you guys are watching this, um...

02:09.497 --> 02:13.432
Your mama had to go somewhere
for just a little while...

02:13.666 --> 02:16.101
But your daddy's gonna
take good care of you

02:16.103 --> 02:19.271
and everything's gonna be okay.

02:19.706 --> 02:21.607
I love you very much.

03:28.541 --> 03:31.176
Okay, so, this is everything.

03:31.579 --> 03:34.146
From both accounts?
Business and personal?

03:36.483 --> 03:37.749
You want to talk about it?

03:37.751 --> 03:39.485
No. Mmm-mmm.

03:39.487 --> 03:40.085
Not really.

03:40.087 --> 03:41.620
Riley, if there's some
kind of emergency...

03:41.622 --> 03:43.422
You know what? Also, I need to make sure

03:43.424 --> 03:46.492
that the house is in Kyle's name only.

03:47.127 --> 03:49.561
Okay, this is not my place to say this,

03:49.563 --> 03:53.265
but given his record, are
you sure that's a good idea?

03:53.267 --> 03:54.433
He's not leaving.

03:54.435 --> 03:56.702
Are you? No.

03:57.003 --> 03:58.971
No, I'm not going anywhere.

04:00.507 --> 04:03.275
As your banker, I do what you ask.

04:03.277 --> 04:04.543
But as your friend,

04:04.545 --> 04:05.611
I got to say, I'm worried about you.

04:05.613 --> 04:09.081
Look, I'm just trying to
take care of my family, okay?

04:10.316 --> 04:12.718
What is there to be worried about?

04:13.153 --> 04:14.720
Okay.

04:24.030 --> 04:25.330
Riley?

04:25.332 --> 04:26.198
Yeah?

04:26.200 --> 04:28.834
You out here? Yep. Out here.

04:28.902 --> 04:32.337
What are you doing? I was
just taking the trash out.

04:32.572 --> 04:33.372
I did that earlier.

04:33.374 --> 04:36.775
Yeah, I know, but you forgot
about the recycling, so... Yeah?

04:38.244 --> 04:39.244
When did you start smoking again?

04:39.246 --> 04:41.246
You know what? I don't have
time for a lecture right now.

04:41.248 --> 04:42.514
So maybe we could just
save this till later.

04:42.516 --> 04:47.085
Whoa. You want to stop and tell
me what's got you so agitated?

04:47.320 --> 04:48.921
Did I do something?

04:48.923 --> 04:49.555
No.

04:49.557 --> 04:52.257
No, you didn't, okay?
I'm sorry, I'm just...

04:52.259 --> 04:56.228
Being a business owner's not
all it's cracked up to be.

04:56.230 --> 04:57.629
I know you need support, all right?

04:57.631 --> 04:59.665
That's what I wanted
to talk to you about.

04:59.667 --> 05:02.100
I talked to Coach Steff this morning.

05:02.102 --> 05:04.203
He thinks he may have something
for me at the high school.

05:04.205 --> 05:06.104
Riley, I know I've been
trying to get something going.

05:06.106 --> 05:10.108
I think this is it, and I have
a really good feeling about it.

05:10.243 --> 05:11.176
Good.

05:11.178 --> 05:12.644
I think I'd be a great coach.

05:12.646 --> 05:15.414
Hey, what are you doing out here?

05:16.149 --> 05:17.583
Are you smoking again?

05:17.585 --> 05:18.951
Yes, I was!

05:18.953 --> 05:21.019
I'm gonna leave you to talk
with Smokey the Bear here.

05:21.021 --> 05:21.954
We'll talk about this later.

05:21.956 --> 05:25.357
Okay, why would you start again
when you know how hard it is to quit?

05:25.359 --> 05:27.025
First of all, this is
not up for discussion.

05:27.027 --> 05:29.928
Second of all, let's not
make this some damn PSA.

05:29.930 --> 05:31.897
What has got your panties in a bunch?

05:31.899 --> 05:34.600
You know what? What is your news?

05:34.734 --> 05:35.133
Well...

05:35.135 --> 05:37.769
There is big news.
Something big is happening.

05:37.771 --> 05:38.870
Dale and I are

05:38.872 --> 05:40.305
being considered for an adoption.

05:40.307 --> 05:43.041
Oh, my God! You're gonna
be a mom? That's great!

05:43.043 --> 05:44.977
Well, we still have to
meet with the expectant mom.

05:44.979 --> 05:47.679
But she handpicked us from
a pile of other applicants.

05:47.681 --> 05:48.413
I mean, so there's that.

05:48.415 --> 05:49.715
So, when is this gonna happen?

05:49.717 --> 05:52.751
Later. But Dale is trying to beat
the nasty weather in West Texas,

05:52.753 --> 05:54.286
and he's not sure he's
gonna be back in time.

05:54.288 --> 05:56.221
So, you think you can come?

05:56.823 --> 05:57.456
Oh, uh...

05:57.458 --> 06:01.593
Really? I'm on the fast track to
mom-hood and you have to think about it?

06:06.099 --> 06:08.033
What's this?

06:08.568 --> 06:11.336
Look, if something happens to me,

06:12.372 --> 06:14.273
help Kyle take care of the kids.

06:14.275 --> 06:15.741
Riley, you are scaring
me. What is going on?

06:15.743 --> 06:18.377
Just do me a favor, and
don't ask me any questions.

06:18.379 --> 06:22.648
Are you kidding? I'm gonna
take care of it, okay?

06:23.750 --> 06:24.416
Ah, come on!

06:24.418 --> 06:27.019
Go get that baby.

07:37.291 --> 07:39.991
Oh, hey. Oh! Hey.

07:40.259 --> 07:43.195
Uh, how's that task-force thing going?

07:43.197 --> 07:46.298
Oh, it's good. Yeah, we're, uh,

07:46.300 --> 07:47.799
closing in on something big.

07:47.801 --> 07:48.967
It's gonna be headline news.

07:48.969 --> 07:52.003
You wouldn't believe
the people involved.

07:52.005 --> 07:54.206
You're staying safe, right? Oh, yeah.

07:54.208 --> 07:56.975
Yeah. We're trained for this.

07:57.276 --> 08:00.045
You all right? You seem... No, I'm...

08:01.614 --> 08:02.114
I'm fine.

08:02.116 --> 08:05.283
You know, I should get going,
so... Okay, listen, um...

08:05.285 --> 08:08.286
Being a Ranger, all the
things I get to do...

08:08.288 --> 08:11.323
I wouldn't be doing it
if it weren't for you.

08:12.959 --> 08:14.860
So, thanks.

08:25.139 --> 08:30.542
We've got Rangers all over the state
closing in on suspect Greg Carlyle.

08:30.544 --> 08:31.676
We're tracking his finances,

08:31.678 --> 08:33.477
and we've got reason to
believe that his profits

08:33.480 --> 08:37.649
are from prostitution and
suspected human trafficking.

08:37.650 --> 08:41.787
We've put surveillance cameras in
his two main bases of operations,

08:41.789 --> 08:43.455
Wild Nights,

08:43.655 --> 08:44.456
and the Violet Orchid.

08:44.458 --> 08:45.924
Trimble, Parks, you'll be the locals

08:45.926 --> 08:48.160
handling the surveillance
at Wild Nights.

08:48.162 --> 08:50.028
Yes, sir. All right.

08:50.030 --> 08:51.830
Let's get back to work.

08:59.405 --> 09:01.039
You know this girl?

09:01.041 --> 09:02.741
No. I never saw her.

09:02.743 --> 09:03.842
Works for Riley.

09:03.844 --> 09:04.543
Name's Nikki Shannon.

09:04.545 --> 09:09.114
Riley had me help her out of a situation
with Carlyle a couple months back.

09:09.116 --> 09:10.549
Appears she got sucked back in.

09:10.551 --> 09:12.851
This was taken a couple of days ago.

09:12.853 --> 09:14.519
Well, we got to tell Riley.

09:14.521 --> 09:15.587
This is a formal investigation.

09:15.589 --> 09:17.722
Everything needs to be done by the book.

09:17.724 --> 09:18.390
She could be in danger.

09:18.392 --> 09:19.891
What if she's mixed
up with something bad?

09:19.893 --> 09:23.261
Well, that's what
we're going to find out.

09:31.737 --> 09:34.272
You're not smiling, and
you're not asking for a drink.

09:34.274 --> 09:38.477
What's wrong? It's bad,
Georgia. It's real bad.

09:38.479 --> 09:40.545
The client list is gone.

09:40.547 --> 09:41.980
I'm sorry.

09:41.982 --> 09:44.015
Did I hear you right? Uh-huh.

09:44.017 --> 09:45.317
I thought you took it out of The Rub...

09:45.319 --> 09:50.622
I did. I did, and I put it in the one
place where no one was gonna find it.

09:50.624 --> 09:51.323
But someone did.

09:51.325 --> 09:55.560
I told you to be
careful. I thought I was.

09:56.597 --> 09:57.729
You see all of this?

09:57.731 --> 10:00.532
I'm not losing this.
I am not losing Harold.

10:00.534 --> 10:02.234
You've got to shut this down.

10:02.236 --> 10:03.935
Okay. Look...

10:04.770 --> 10:06.037
I think it was Carlyle.

10:06.039 --> 10:09.207
All right, now, didn't
you tell me that he was...

10:09.542 --> 10:12.377
Didn't you tell me that he
offered you money for The Rub?

10:12.379 --> 10:16.548
You only get one chance to kill a snake.

10:16.550 --> 10:21.786
You have got to cut its
head off and crush it.

10:28.997 --> 10:31.765
Dale, future baby mama
is here. Are you close?

10:31.767 --> 10:35.002
Call me. Or better yet, just get here.

10:37.872 --> 10:38.472
I guess it's, uh...

10:38.474 --> 10:41.174
It's just gonna be me. The
hubby's trying to get here.

10:41.176 --> 10:42.376
He's out trucking, you know?

10:42.378 --> 10:46.446
"Get out of the way!"

10:46.981 --> 10:48.682
You know, I'm not gonna lie,

10:48.684 --> 10:51.785
picking your kid's
parents is kind of weird.

10:51.787 --> 10:54.955
But the truth is, I
can't do it on my own.

10:54.957 --> 10:56.189
My ex-boyfriend, Billy, bailed,

10:56.191 --> 10:59.326
right after he found out
I was knocked up, so...

10:59.594 --> 11:01.662
Total dick, right?

11:01.664 --> 11:02.729
So...

11:02.731 --> 11:03.330
Here I am.

11:03.332 --> 11:05.933
This must be really hard for you.

11:05.935 --> 11:07.467
Oh, I practically raised myself.

11:07.469 --> 11:10.804
I just don't want my kid to grow
up lonely like I did, you know?

11:10.806 --> 11:12.940
Hey. Sorry. You do not
have to worry about us

11:12.942 --> 11:14.241
not being there for that baby.

11:14.243 --> 11:16.376
I'm here. I'm here.
Hey! He's here! Okay!

11:16.378 --> 11:16.944
I'm sorry.

11:16.946 --> 11:18.745
Dale, this is Kim. Hi! Kim!

11:18.747 --> 11:20.213
Kimmy-Kim! Kim-Kim!
No, just Kim.

11:20.215 --> 11:21.949
Kimo-sabe! It's just Kim. Just Kim.

11:21.951 --> 11:23.784
I'm gonna stop talking 'cause...

11:23.786 --> 11:27.087
She's the one with the
questions. I'm sorry. Go.

11:27.623 --> 11:30.257
Um, well, I just want
to get to know you guys,

11:30.259 --> 11:34.928
find out stuff that wasn't
in the application, so...

11:34.930 --> 11:35.929
What do you do for fun?

11:35.931 --> 11:37.965
Uh, we... Uh, we...

11:37.967 --> 11:40.133
We love to take care of
our best friends' kids,

11:40.135 --> 11:41.101
Travis and Katie. Yeah, for sure.

11:41.103 --> 11:43.770
Yeah, and I bake, as
you can see. Yeah, oh.

11:44.340 --> 11:46.206
Sometimes we take walks.
And, oh, oh, Dale...

11:46.208 --> 11:47.441
Dale loves to watch reality TV.

11:47.443 --> 11:49.776
Honey, just, uh, making
us sound really boring.

11:49.778 --> 11:50.777
We, uh, go to the batting cages.

11:50.779 --> 11:53.413
Oh, I'm sorry, and the batting
cages is the "not-boring" thing?

11:53.415 --> 11:57.317
Uh, all right. Well, I'm in
a rock band. No, he's not.

11:57.319 --> 11:59.786
A band? That's awesome.

12:02.557 --> 12:03.924
You okay?

12:04.392 --> 12:06.493
It's hormones, uh...

12:06.861 --> 12:08.662
You guys seem fun and, like,

12:08.664 --> 12:10.030
just the right amount of weird.

12:10.032 --> 12:13.266
And I can tell you love
each other like mad.

12:13.268 --> 12:15.402
Just a little bit, yeah. Eh.

12:16.505 --> 12:19.206
You know what? I like you guys.

12:19.208 --> 12:21.108
I wish I had had a mom and dad like you.

12:21.110 --> 12:24.177
Well, you know what? You play your
cards right, we'll adopt you, too.

12:24.179 --> 12:25.145
How's that? Dale!

12:25.147 --> 12:28.215
It's too much? Sorry. A little bit.

12:29.017 --> 12:31.685
Your kid is gonna have a great family.

12:31.853 --> 12:33.186
What? Wait, really?

12:33.188 --> 12:33.920
Are you serious, really?

12:33.922 --> 12:36.523
Oh, to hear you say that. That is
so great! I thought she blew it.

12:36.525 --> 12:38.325
Hey! I really thought
we were blowing it.

12:38.327 --> 12:42.095
Okay, well, I should go before
this turns into some weird cry-fest

12:42.097 --> 12:43.430
and we're forced to hug it out, so...

12:43.432 --> 12:47.334
Oh, no, get in here. We're gonna
hug it out. Come on! Come on!

12:47.336 --> 12:47.968
Oh!

12:47.970 --> 12:50.170
I got a doctor's
appointment. You'll come?

12:50.172 --> 12:51.238
Doctor's appointment? Oh, yes! Yes!

12:51.240 --> 12:52.906
That's awesome! We would love that!

12:52.908 --> 12:55.342
Okay. Okay.

12:55.543 --> 12:57.177
Okay. Bye.

12:57.679 --> 13:00.247
We're getting a baby! Get in here!

13:00.249 --> 13:01.381
Oh! The baby!

13:01.383 --> 13:04.251
We're having a baby!
- Yes, we are!

13:04.686 --> 13:06.920
Wow! Oh, my God!

13:17.532 --> 13:18.298
Get in!

13:18.300 --> 13:21.368
I said I had your back and
this is how you repay me?

13:21.370 --> 13:23.503
By e-mailing me threats?

13:23.505 --> 13:25.072
Okay, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

13:25.074 --> 13:31.611
"Shut down the task force in 48 hours or your
activities at The Rub will be made public."

13:31.613 --> 13:32.112
What?

13:32.114 --> 13:35.482
Are you crazy? You'll notice
it's addressed to Mr. Louboutin.

13:35.484 --> 13:38.418
I didn't send you
this threat, all right?

13:38.420 --> 13:41.154
I have as much to lose as you do.

13:41.957 --> 13:47.094
You better find out who's behind this
and fast or we are all going down.

13:48.696 --> 13:50.297
Get out of here!

14:01.075 --> 14:03.009
What's that? My house key.

14:03.011 --> 14:04.377
I don't want it.

14:04.379 --> 14:06.313
Not what you said last night.

14:06.315 --> 14:07.147
Oh, you are such a child.

14:07.149 --> 14:08.615
Look it's just a key.
Not kissing in public.

14:08.617 --> 14:10.917
Not a marriage proposal.
It's just a key.

14:10.919 --> 14:12.686
Mmm-hmm. I hear you.

14:12.688 --> 14:13.353
Still not taking it.

14:13.355 --> 14:14.788
Ah, probably wouldn't work anyway.

14:14.790 --> 14:17.858
Reverse psychology won't
get me to play house.

14:17.860 --> 14:18.525
It means more sex.

14:18.527 --> 14:20.594
I know what it means, and
you're freaking me out.

14:20.596 --> 14:22.195
Fine. That makes two of us.

14:27.168 --> 14:29.002
You, uh, lose something?

14:29.671 --> 14:31.938
The client list is gone.

14:32.840 --> 14:34.341
What? You think it was one of us?

14:34.343 --> 14:36.510
No, Overton said that he was threatened

14:36.512 --> 14:37.410
and that it came from here.

14:37.412 --> 14:39.546
Okay, wait, wait, wait.
It wasn't me, okay?

14:39.548 --> 14:41.448
Blackmail ain't my thing.
I think it was Nikki.

14:41.450 --> 14:45.085
Oh, I knew it! I knew I
couldn't trust that girl!

14:45.087 --> 14:47.888
Ooh! With those
damsel-in-distress eyes,

14:47.890 --> 14:49.222
and that voice... Please!

14:49.224 --> 14:51.057
I want to watch while you fire her ass!

14:51.059 --> 14:52.559
Selena, do you understand me?

14:52.561 --> 14:57.798
If we don't find that list, The Rub
is gone, and we all go to prison.

14:58.132 --> 14:58.999
Okay. All right.

14:59.001 --> 15:01.101
She's in room seven. Let's go.

15:01.103 --> 15:02.569
Come on.

15:08.676 --> 15:10.277
You guys aren't here
for a couple's massage?

15:10.279 --> 15:13.613
Actually, we just need to
talk to one of your employees.

15:13.615 --> 15:14.347
Nikki Shannon.

15:14.349 --> 15:17.250
Is she here? She is...

15:17.252 --> 15:18.351
Popular today.

15:18.353 --> 15:21.054
Uh, can you go get Nikki, please?

15:21.056 --> 15:22.556
What is this all about?

15:22.558 --> 15:23.256
Ranger business.

15:23.258 --> 15:26.092
Can I ask you some
questions while we wait?

15:26.260 --> 15:27.961
Yeah. Okay.

15:27.963 --> 15:29.429
When did you hire Ms. Shannon?

15:29.431 --> 15:31.331
Uh, a few months ago?

15:31.833 --> 15:32.966
Did you check her employment history?

15:32.968 --> 15:37.304
Yes, she was working at Wild Nights
to pay her way through college.

15:37.306 --> 15:37.804
Stripping?

15:37.806 --> 15:42.309
Yes, um... Sometimes hiring a
girl with a past can be a gamble.

15:42.311 --> 15:46.813
Monroe said that he responded to
an incident involving you, Nikki,

15:46.815 --> 15:48.582
and Greg Carlyle.

15:48.584 --> 15:49.082
Did, uh...

15:49.084 --> 15:52.185
Did Nikki happen to mention him since?

15:52.187 --> 15:54.487
I heard y'all were looking for me?

15:54.489 --> 15:56.656
Uh, yeah. Here you go.

15:56.658 --> 15:58.959
We need to take you in for
questioning, Ms. Shannon.

15:58.961 --> 16:00.861
For what? This may take a while.

16:00.863 --> 16:03.897
We appreciate your cooperation.

16:11.205 --> 16:12.839
Oh, God.

16:12.841 --> 16:14.274
Wait, wait. Here.

16:14.276 --> 16:16.576
Oh, God!

16:21.949 --> 16:24.751
You all right? I'm okay.

16:28.691 --> 16:29.757
What the hell happened out there?

16:29.759 --> 16:32.727
Shh. I don't know. Nikki
got herself into trouble.

16:32.729 --> 16:34.429
Client list trouble? I'm not sure.

16:34.431 --> 16:36.731
Could be anything with
that girl. Selena...

16:36.733 --> 16:40.668
Hey, if this has anything to do with what
you and I do in those treatment rooms,

16:40.670 --> 16:41.736
you better tell me right now.

16:41.738 --> 16:43.004
Look. Riley's handling it, Okay?

16:43.006 --> 16:44.706
Well, it didn't look like it.

16:45.308 --> 16:47.709
Derek, we got to trust her, okay?

16:47.711 --> 16:49.544
Just don't worry.

16:54.116 --> 16:57.919
So, it turns out your friend
Carlyle or the companies he controls

16:57.921 --> 17:01.422
own 23 strip clubs all
around the Gulf Coast.

17:01.424 --> 17:02.991
I don't know anything about that.

17:02.993 --> 17:06.394
So, you're telling me you don't know
anything about human trafficking,

17:06.396 --> 17:08.997
prostitution, drugs, weapons?

17:08.999 --> 17:09.998
No, sir. Really?

17:10.000 --> 17:13.968
'Cause you've been taking off your clothes
with these gals for about three years now.

17:13.970 --> 17:15.869
Thought y'all would
be all kinds of chummy,

17:15.872 --> 17:17.771
sharing your deepest, darkest secrets.

17:17.773 --> 17:20.909
I was just trying to work
my way through school,

17:20.911 --> 17:23.111
minding my own business.

17:23.113 --> 17:25.313
I haven't seen him...

17:25.714 --> 17:27.749
...in a long time.

17:27.751 --> 17:29.284
That right?

17:31.121 --> 17:32.887
Well, you, uh...

17:32.889 --> 17:37.258
You seemed real cozy
with Carlyle last week.

17:53.442 --> 17:55.443
Reese had me trace
Carlyle's dummy companies.

17:55.445 --> 17:58.146
Even though you're
not on the task force?

17:58.148 --> 17:58.546
For now.

17:58.548 --> 18:00.615
You're not gonna believe who
one of these companies employed.

18:00.617 --> 18:04.352
The guy who broke into Riley's
house works for Carlyle.

18:04.354 --> 18:07.488
Now one of his strippers
works at The Rub.

18:07.490 --> 18:08.690
What are you saying?

18:08.692 --> 18:11.292
I'm saying that's quite a coincidence.

18:11.294 --> 18:13.728
All Riley did was give that girl a job

18:13.730 --> 18:15.296
and get her away from Carlyle.

18:15.298 --> 18:18.132
Riley didn't know what
she was dealing with.

18:18.134 --> 18:20.068
Ever the loyal
brother-in-law.

18:20.070 --> 18:21.402
What's that supposed to mean?

18:21.404 --> 18:24.739
You're the Texas Ranger. Figure it out.

18:32.615 --> 18:34.449
You want to know the sex?

18:34.451 --> 18:35.316
Yes.

18:35.318 --> 18:36.751
It's a boy.
- Yes!

18:36.753 --> 18:39.287
No, I would have been really
stoked if it was a girl, too.

18:39.289 --> 18:41.022
No. I would have been! But that is...

18:41.024 --> 18:42.323
That is awesome! Come on!

18:42.325 --> 18:45.093
A little baby-man for me
to watch football with.

18:45.095 --> 18:46.094
Oh, he's such a little bean.

18:46.096 --> 18:49.464
Look at him. Oh. He's
smiling. Did you see that?

18:49.466 --> 18:50.098
I think so. Yeah.

18:50.100 --> 18:51.599
Or is that his tush? Is that his tush?

18:51.601 --> 18:54.702
I don't know. I couldn't tell.

18:55.304 --> 18:57.338
Billy? What are you doing here?

18:58.340 --> 18:59.641
Um...

18:59.708 --> 19:02.143
Can I talk to you for a minute...

19:02.645 --> 19:03.444
Alone?

19:03.446 --> 19:06.614
They're the adoptive
parents. They can stay.

19:10.487 --> 19:13.021
I don't want to give up the baby.

19:13.989 --> 19:14.622
Or you.

19:14.624 --> 19:16.524
You should have thought of that before.

19:16.526 --> 19:18.926
Yeah, well, I was scared.

19:21.463 --> 19:22.964
We're young and...

19:22.966 --> 19:26.034
We've got our whole lives ahead of us.

19:26.602 --> 19:28.903
But I'm not scared anymore.

19:32.541 --> 19:34.809
I'll call you guys later, okay?

19:34.811 --> 19:37.245
Sure. Of course. Okay, um...

19:37.247 --> 19:39.714
We'll be home.

19:44.153 --> 19:45.720
Okay.

19:45.854 --> 19:48.589
Where's Nikki? They finished
questioning her and released her.

19:48.591 --> 19:50.658
Evan, I want to know
what the hell's going on.

19:50.660 --> 19:51.559
You know I can't tell you.

19:51.561 --> 19:53.861
Come on. Cut the
Ranger shit. I'm family.

19:53.863 --> 19:55.496
We need to talk.

19:55.498 --> 19:58.032
Parking lot, now. Good.

20:02.204 --> 20:04.672
Look, I know that
you're risking your job.

20:04.674 --> 20:07.575
The guy that broke into your
house and attacked Lacey.

20:07.577 --> 20:08.376
Wait, Sean Foster?

20:08.378 --> 20:10.411
What does he have to do with Nikki?

20:10.413 --> 20:12.714
Foster works for Carlyle.

20:12.716 --> 20:14.716
Oh, my God. Lacey.

20:14.718 --> 20:17.719
Any idea why these guys
would break into your house?

20:17.721 --> 20:18.486
I mean, I don't know.

20:18.488 --> 20:21.022
Maybe 'cause it's payback,
you know, for helping Nikki.

20:21.024 --> 20:24.726
Look, I know you thought you were
bailing this girl out of a bad situation.

20:24.728 --> 20:25.727
But she is not worth it.

20:25.729 --> 20:27.962
Wait a minute. Wait.
When was that taken?

20:27.964 --> 20:31.733
A few days ago. You need
to keep your distance.

20:33.402 --> 20:33.935
Oh, I will.

20:33.937 --> 20:35.770
You understand? This
cannot be like last time.

20:35.772 --> 20:39.173
You cannot take this into
your own hands. Yeah, I get it.

20:39.175 --> 20:41.676
Riley, promise me.

20:42.010 --> 20:44.479
Thank you, Evan.

20:51.121 --> 20:52.620
Kyle.

20:53.155 --> 20:54.655
Hey, Coach.

20:54.657 --> 20:56.157
Oh, it's good to see you.

20:56.159 --> 20:56.991
You, too.

20:56.993 --> 20:58.993
Thank you so much for this opportunity.

20:58.995 --> 20:59.761
Sure. Really.

20:59.763 --> 21:04.832
Uh, I lost my old playbook, but I
spent some time watching game tapes.

21:04.834 --> 21:05.967
I drew up some new
stuff for the offense.

21:05.969 --> 21:08.903
I really feel like I could add
value, Coach, in any position.

21:08.905 --> 21:10.104
Son...

21:10.106 --> 21:13.174
I got you a job, but it's not that kind.

21:13.176 --> 21:19.480
With all the bad publicity, I just
can't have you on the coaching staff.

21:20.115 --> 21:21.115
Uh...

21:21.117 --> 21:23.651
The job I got for you

21:23.653 --> 21:25.453
is maintenance.

21:25.654 --> 21:28.723
But, you know, down the road,

21:28.725 --> 21:30.892
things can change.

21:31.593 --> 21:33.094
Coach.

21:34.330 --> 21:35.763
Maintenance. Really?

21:35.765 --> 21:37.365
I know.

21:43.005 --> 21:44.705
I understand.

21:46.775 --> 21:49.043
The bottom line is, I need a job.

21:49.278 --> 21:52.446
You always said chop some wood
and a tree will fall, right?

21:52.448 --> 21:54.081
Yeah.

21:55.184 --> 21:57.151
Well, I'll chop some wood.

21:57.719 --> 21:58.686
Good.

21:58.688 --> 22:00.822
We'll see you Monday. Thanks.

22:00.824 --> 22:02.423
All right.

22:14.136 --> 22:15.670
Hey!

22:19.808 --> 22:21.342
Dude, nice arm.

22:21.977 --> 22:23.277
Yeah.

22:25.581 --> 22:27.849
You used me to get the client list?

22:27.851 --> 22:31.152
Do you know that I risked my
life to help you with Carlyle!

22:31.154 --> 22:32.153
I trusted you. No!

22:32.155 --> 22:34.121
Someone broke into my
house because of you!

22:34.123 --> 22:37.291
My best friend lost
her baby because of you!

22:37.293 --> 22:40.194
I never meant to hurt anyone. Please.

22:40.196 --> 22:41.696
You have to let me explain.

22:41.698 --> 22:42.363
Explain what, Nikki?

22:42.365 --> 22:44.699
Explain how you lied to
me over and over again?

22:44.701 --> 22:46.500
Now get up right now! Let's go!

22:46.502 --> 22:48.870
Carlyle threatened to kill me if
I didn't get the list from you.

22:48.872 --> 22:54.041
I followed you. But I dug it up. And
I didn't give it to him. I have it.

22:54.043 --> 22:55.543
Well, then where is it, Nikki?

22:55.545 --> 22:57.178
Let's go!

22:57.980 --> 23:00.281
I got it. I got it right
here. Where is it, Nikki?

23:00.283 --> 23:02.617
It's okay. It's okay.
I'll give it to you.

23:02.619 --> 23:05.419
Open your trunk! I'll give it to you!

23:05.421 --> 23:06.854
It's in here. Where?

23:06.856 --> 23:08.890
It's in here. I promise it's right here.

23:08.892 --> 23:11.893
I swear to God, Nikki! It's right here.

23:15.497 --> 23:17.031
He has it.

23:19.067 --> 23:20.902
Carlyle has it!

23:21.403 --> 23:22.403
No.

23:22.405 --> 23:23.337
Riley, I am so sorry!

23:23.339 --> 23:27.975
You're dead to me! Do
you hear me? Dead to me!

23:28.877 --> 23:30.211
How could you?

23:30.213 --> 23:32.580
Riley... No.

23:32.881 --> 23:34.248
Riley!

23:49.033 --> 23:51.000
I've only got time for good news.

23:51.002 --> 23:53.503
I was right about
Carlyle. He's got the list.

23:53.505 --> 23:54.737
I said good news!

23:54.739 --> 23:57.440
You know what? I'm gonna get it back.

23:57.442 --> 24:00.343
How are you gonna make that happen?

24:00.345 --> 24:02.411
Is your head in the damn clouds?

24:02.413 --> 24:04.046
This is over. We are over.

24:04.048 --> 24:06.282
No, we are not over, okay?
I'm gonna survive this,

24:06.284 --> 24:07.984
just like I have
everything else in my life.

24:07.986 --> 24:09.485
And how are you gonna get it, huh?

24:09.487 --> 24:10.653
You're gonna waltz into Wild Nights

24:10.655 --> 24:13.723
with a plate full of
cookies and ask politely?

24:13.725 --> 24:15.558
The man's a sleazeball.

24:15.560 --> 24:19.162
If you try to get this list
back, he's going to kill you!

24:19.164 --> 24:20.596
Georgia, would you keep your voice down?

24:20.598 --> 24:24.734
Please. Now, can't we just, I don't
know, talk to someone on the list?

24:24.736 --> 24:26.135
And tell them what?

24:26.137 --> 24:27.637
That they're about to be exposed?

24:27.639 --> 24:28.971
Well, we have to do something.

24:28.973 --> 24:31.641
We? I got out of the business.

24:31.643 --> 24:33.142
It's about time I wash my hands of it.

24:33.144 --> 24:35.878
This is your responsibility.
This is your mess.

24:35.880 --> 24:39.248
No, Georgia, you are not leaving me
right now, okay? You cannot jump ship.

24:39.250 --> 24:41.150
Riley, you're on your
own. No, I have a deed,

24:41.152 --> 24:45.755
and your name is on it. So,
therefore, I am not on my own.

24:45.989 --> 24:48.758
The man's a monster, Riley.

24:49.159 --> 24:50.960
I'm scared.

24:50.962 --> 24:53.062
I'm just scared.

24:53.931 --> 24:55.431
So am I.

24:58.202 --> 25:02.838
Thanks for coming down, Shelby.
We're pulling you off Evan.

25:02.840 --> 25:03.272
What?

25:03.274 --> 25:07.109
One of detective divisions needs
a trainee on the night watch.

25:07.111 --> 25:08.978
The commanding officer picked you.

25:08.980 --> 25:13.816
That means I'm... I'm... As a detective?

25:13.818 --> 25:14.350
Temporarily.

25:14.352 --> 25:18.888
If you get called up permanently,
you'll be the youngest female detective

25:18.890 --> 25:20.656
I.A. has ever had.

25:20.658 --> 25:22.425
Internal affairs?

25:22.726 --> 25:24.360
That's right.

25:26.363 --> 25:28.664
I need you to watch Evan for me.

25:28.666 --> 25:32.235
Our investigation may or
may not involve his family.

25:32.237 --> 25:35.271
Need to make sure he's on
the right side of things.

25:35.906 --> 25:38.741
You'll be notified for your briefing.

25:46.750 --> 25:51.821
You do realize I'm in a
personal relationship with him?

25:52.422 --> 25:55.191
Why do you think I.A. asked for you?

25:55.926 --> 25:58.861
You want the promotion or not?

26:10.807 --> 26:14.043
How about Elliot? Elliot's a great name.

26:14.045 --> 26:15.811
Elliot.

26:15.813 --> 26:17.013
Elliot.

26:17.015 --> 26:19.282
Oh, come on! Not even a
grin? That was my best E.T.

26:19.284 --> 26:22.418
I... I don't understand how
you can be so confident now?

26:22.420 --> 26:23.452
My mama hormones are making me Zen.

26:23.454 --> 26:27.189
You... You do realize, though, that
you're not actually the one who's pregnant.

26:27.191 --> 26:28.991
It's gestational simpatico.

26:28.993 --> 26:31.594
Okay, I don't speak Spanish.
Is that a real thing?

26:31.596 --> 26:33.863
Yeah, they did a lot of research on it.

26:33.865 --> 26:34.330
Honey...

26:34.332 --> 26:36.532
This is not about some crazy
internet science article.

26:36.534 --> 26:40.970
This is... This is real. This is
about a girl about to walk in here

26:40.972 --> 26:43.906
and tell us that she's
not giving up her baby.

26:43.908 --> 26:44.807
You don't know that.

26:44.809 --> 26:46.275
After everything that
we have been through...

26:46.277 --> 26:48.077
After everything that
you've been through...

26:48.079 --> 26:50.913
When you lose something,
you get something back.

26:50.915 --> 26:52.448
That's also a scientific fact.

26:52.450 --> 26:55.418
But you saw the look on her face
when her boyfriend walked in.

26:55.420 --> 26:57.553
She's not giving up that baby.

26:57.555 --> 26:58.220
I guarantee you

26:58.222 --> 27:01.557
she would not be coming here to
give us bad news face-to-face.

27:01.559 --> 27:03.025
Okay, really? Yeah.

27:03.027 --> 27:05.094
Honey, I just...

27:06.296 --> 27:07.830
Hon, what's the matter?

27:10.268 --> 27:12.034
I, um...

27:12.803 --> 27:15.638
You guys are the parents I wish I had.

27:18.042 --> 27:20.409
You're truly the most
loving people I've ever met.

27:22.613 --> 27:24.647
You changed your mind.

27:32.457 --> 27:34.590
I think my water broke.

27:35.892 --> 27:37.460
What?

27:38.528 --> 27:39.328
What? Are you okay?

27:39.330 --> 27:42.298
She's... She's having a
baby. I'm gonna get a towel.

27:42.300 --> 27:43.799
Okay. Okay.

27:43.801 --> 27:45.935
Okay. Just stay with me. Just breathe.

27:49.040 --> 27:51.474
Call 911. 911?

27:51.541 --> 27:55.111
She's having the baby,
and we are gonna help her.

28:46.530 --> 28:48.130
Hey. Hey.

28:48.132 --> 28:50.266
How you doing?

28:50.667 --> 28:51.901
Pretty good...

28:51.903 --> 28:55.104
Considering I almost gave
birth in a hair salon.

28:55.106 --> 28:56.839
That's true.

28:56.841 --> 28:58.674
It makes for a great country song

28:58.676 --> 29:00.376
if you want it for your band.

29:00.378 --> 29:02.445
That's not a bad idea.

29:02.447 --> 29:04.213
Anyway...

29:04.748 --> 29:05.448
Thanks.

29:05.450 --> 29:08.150
I couldn't have done
it without you guys.

29:08.152 --> 29:10.686
Hey. Sorry I'm late.

29:11.455 --> 29:15.357
Well, we'll... We'll
let you get some rest.

29:15.359 --> 29:16.725
Take care of yourself.

29:16.727 --> 29:18.561
Uh, look, if you need anything,

29:18.563 --> 29:21.764
just pick up the phone
and call, all right?

29:24.835 --> 29:27.837
Wow. We have a baby.

29:29.773 --> 29:30.873
Actually...

29:30.875 --> 29:33.375
You know what you said
about us being young

29:33.377 --> 29:36.745
and having our whole lives ahead of us?

29:36.747 --> 29:37.413
Well, it's true.

29:37.415 --> 29:40.382
And I don't trust that
we're in it till the end.

29:40.384 --> 29:42.651
But those two...

29:43.453 --> 29:44.653
They are.

29:44.655 --> 29:47.089
And when I look into our baby's eyes,

29:47.091 --> 29:53.195
I don't want to deny him the chance
to have parents like that, you know?

29:53.197 --> 29:55.264
A life like that.

29:56.900 --> 29:59.668
But... As hard as it is,

29:59.769 --> 30:04.206
we both know it's the right choice.

30:05.175 --> 30:06.575
Okay?

30:17.521 --> 30:20.156
<i>The National Weather
Service has issued</i>

30:20.158 --> 30:23.693
<i>a severe thunderstorm warning
for Jefferson county.</i>

30:23.695 --> 30:26.996
<i>Strong winds have been reported with...</i>

30:27.631 --> 30:29.265
Forty-eight hours?

30:29.867 --> 30:30.467
Nine hours ago.

30:30.469 --> 30:33.436
Thirty-six until yours
truly is front-page news.

30:33.438 --> 30:35.805
There's no way that you
can stop the task force?

30:35.807 --> 30:38.108
The task force is set
in motion, darling.

30:38.110 --> 30:40.643
It is massive, and it is statewide,

30:40.645 --> 30:41.411
and nobody's stopping it.

30:41.413 --> 30:46.049
I've got a search warrant sitting on my
desk right now just waiting to be signed.

30:46.051 --> 30:47.016
Who's it for?

30:47.018 --> 30:49.719
Wild Nights. They're
moving in on Greg Carlyle.

30:49.721 --> 30:51.955
Okay, look, that threat you got?

30:51.957 --> 30:55.024
It's from him. He's got my client list.

30:55.026 --> 30:56.693
You keep written records?

30:56.695 --> 30:57.694
What the hell were you thinking?

30:57.696 --> 30:59.395
I'll tell you what I was thinking,

30:59.397 --> 31:00.330
I was thinking life insurance.

31:00.332 --> 31:02.899
Bum policy when it's in
the wrong hands, isn't it?

31:02.901 --> 31:04.300
I'm gonna fix this.

31:04.302 --> 31:07.203
Let's hope so.

31:07.605 --> 31:10.607
You just let me know when
you sign that warrant.

31:12.978 --> 31:14.644
Okay, high chair, stroller,
car seat. Yep, yep.

31:14.646 --> 31:16.513
Oh, my God, Dale. We don't have
a car seat. We got a car seat.

31:16.515 --> 31:19.015
How are we gonna get him home?
Kyle's bringing us a car seat. Boom.

31:19.017 --> 31:22.585
Okay, diapers, bottles, formula,
changing table. Yeah. Okay.

31:22.587 --> 31:24.053
Oh, my God, We have nothing.

31:24.055 --> 31:27.023
Hey, we got our son. We got everything.

31:27.025 --> 31:27.824
Boom! You're right.

31:27.826 --> 31:30.193
I'm just nervous. I mean, most
parents have nine months to prepare.

31:30.195 --> 31:32.862
We had a day. It all happened so fast.

31:32.864 --> 31:34.464
Yeah, but humankind
didn't cease to exist

31:34.466 --> 31:37.133
just because they didn't have
the all-terrain stroller...

31:37.135 --> 31:38.601
Although we're definitely
getting one of those.

31:38.603 --> 31:39.602
You see the tires on that thing?

31:39.604 --> 31:42.839
It's like... ...Bigfoot! Coming through!

31:42.841 --> 31:45.141
We can handle this. We're Locklin's.

31:45.143 --> 31:46.009
Boom!

31:46.011 --> 31:48.511
And now there are three of us.

31:48.513 --> 31:49.946
Boom, boom, boom.

31:52.817 --> 31:54.450
Boom.

32:00.958 --> 32:02.759
You still freaked?

32:04.496 --> 32:07.163
Mildly.

32:11.202 --> 32:13.736
It ain't gonna happen, cowboy.

32:13.738 --> 32:15.872
See, I'm confused.

32:16.207 --> 32:18.575
You say you're traditional.

32:19.143 --> 32:20.910
You want to get married.

32:20.912 --> 32:23.046
But on the other hand,

32:23.380 --> 32:25.381
you hate PDA.

32:25.883 --> 32:30.086
But then when we get home, all you
want to do is hump like bunnies.

32:30.154 --> 32:31.821
See...

32:32.156 --> 32:33.823
You said home.

32:33.825 --> 32:35.992
That's what I'm afraid of.

32:36.393 --> 32:40.230
By the time you get done here
tonight, it's gonna be late.

32:40.431 --> 32:42.565
I'll already be in my bed.

32:42.567 --> 32:44.234
Naked.

32:45.603 --> 32:47.971
You could let yourself in.

32:51.609 --> 32:53.176
Okay.

32:53.978 --> 32:56.646
But only 'cause you're gonna be naked.

32:57.147 --> 33:00.950
It's gonna be kind of like a hotel key.

33:00.952 --> 33:04.120
I'm gonna give it back
at the end of my stay.

33:07.491 --> 33:09.259
Okay, so, why do they call it swaddling?

33:09.261 --> 33:11.261
I don't know. Should we know that?

33:11.263 --> 33:13.863
Yeah, we got to Google that.

33:15.432 --> 33:16.900
Hey! Look at you! Hey!

33:16.902 --> 33:19.502
Parenthood's already
looking good on you guys.

33:19.504 --> 33:21.371
I'm good. I'm like a new man.

33:21.373 --> 33:22.839
Can you see the spring in his step?

33:22.841 --> 33:24.107
Yeah, I call it my daddy mojo.

33:24.109 --> 33:25.375
Thank you for this. Yeah, of course.

33:25.377 --> 33:26.609
Aw, you just missed the baby.

33:26.611 --> 33:28.077
The nurses just took him to the nursery.

33:28.079 --> 33:29.479
Oh, I can't wait to meet him. Hey.

33:29.481 --> 33:32.548
You want some help with that?
It's not as easy as it looks.

33:32.550 --> 33:33.917
No, no, are you kidding me?

33:33.919 --> 33:35.151
Hey, I can take a motor apart

33:35.153 --> 33:36.819
and put it back together
during lunch break

33:36.821 --> 33:40.023
and still eat a burrito.
I think I can handle this.

33:40.025 --> 33:42.926
Okay, I'll figure it out.

33:42.928 --> 33:44.761
Lacey, I'm so happy for you.

33:44.763 --> 33:46.596
I know how long you've
been wanting this.

33:46.598 --> 33:49.065
It's pretty crazy, right? Yeah.

33:49.067 --> 33:50.667
So, is Riley coming?

33:50.669 --> 33:51.768
I left her a message.

33:51.770 --> 33:54.437
And I know she's been really
stressed-out about work.

33:54.439 --> 33:58.374
Yeah, I mean, I've tried
to call her a bunch, too.

33:58.376 --> 33:58.875
Yeah.

33:58.877 --> 34:01.077
I mean, she's missed a lot
of stuff 'cause of work,

34:01.079 --> 34:02.879
but she wouldn't miss this.

34:02.881 --> 34:03.880
Not me getting my son.

34:03.882 --> 34:06.215
No. I... I'm worried.

34:06.217 --> 34:09.052
Hey, you have enough to worry about.

34:09.054 --> 34:10.119
All right, you're a new mom.

34:10.121 --> 34:14.324
I'm sure she's fine. And she'll
be here as soon as she can.

34:14.692 --> 34:17.960
Yeah. You're probably right.

34:33.277 --> 34:35.311
Hey, it's me again. I'm at the hospital.

34:35.313 --> 34:38.114
Lacey and Dale are
wondering where you are.

34:38.116 --> 34:41.250
You got to come by and
see this little baby.

34:41.252 --> 34:43.119
Call me, please.

34:44.522 --> 34:45.655
Hey. Is Riley here?

34:45.657 --> 34:49.158
No. No, I haven't been
able to reach her all day.

34:49.159 --> 34:51.793
Hey, have you ever seen this guy?

34:52.362 --> 34:54.597
No. What's going on? She
in some kind of trouble?

34:54.599 --> 34:57.033
This guy's connected with
someone Riley hired at The Rub.

34:57.034 --> 34:59.769
I think she might be trying
to help the wrong person.

34:59.771 --> 35:00.536
I'm gonna go look for her.

35:00.538 --> 35:02.538
All right, you tell them I'll be back.

35:02.540 --> 35:03.639
Okay.

35:03.641 --> 35:05.074
Hey, another Parks brother.

35:05.076 --> 35:05.975
You got to come in and meet my son.

35:05.977 --> 35:08.611
Lacey was all worried, and I
was like, "Hey, you know what?

35:08.613 --> 35:10.079
"Everything's gonna be okay."

35:10.081 --> 35:10.680
Is he cute?

35:10.682 --> 35:13.116
Cute? He's a Locklin. Yes, he's cute.

35:13.118 --> 35:14.784
What is this? Aw, thank you.

35:14.786 --> 35:16.185
Hey, listen, I... I got to run.

35:16.187 --> 35:19.622
Riley might be in a little
bit of trouble, but, um...

35:19.624 --> 35:20.356
What? She okay?

35:20.358 --> 35:23.493
Yeah, I'm sure. Just tell
Lacey I said "Congratulations."

35:23.495 --> 35:25.461
Uh, yeah, yeah, he's
only gonna get cuter.

35:25.463 --> 35:27.663
All right. Go be a cop.

36:32.262 --> 36:35.364
Hey. I got here as fast as I could.

36:35.366 --> 36:37.333
Aw, look at the baby!

36:37.634 --> 36:39.569
What is wrong with you, Riley Parks?

36:39.571 --> 36:41.237
You can't just hand me a stack of cash,

36:41.239 --> 36:42.405
tell me to take care of your kids,

36:42.407 --> 36:45.875
and then not check
in. I was worried sick.

36:45.877 --> 36:47.410
Now talk.

36:47.711 --> 36:50.446
Someone took the client list from me.

36:50.448 --> 36:51.948
What?

36:52.249 --> 36:55.151
What... What are you...
What are you gonna do?

36:55.153 --> 36:56.853
I'm gonna get it back.

36:56.855 --> 36:58.121
How?

36:58.722 --> 37:00.389
I got a plan.

37:00.391 --> 37:02.992
Can... Can I help you? Just...

37:03.260 --> 37:05.094
Be a good mom.

37:05.096 --> 37:06.529
You can do that.

37:06.531 --> 37:12.368
Hey. Lacey, do not worry about
me, okay? I'm gonna be fine.

37:13.070 --> 37:17.240
I worry about you every
day, doing what you do.

37:18.108 --> 37:19.575
Every day.

37:24.715 --> 37:27.817
Want to meet Cole Locklin? Yes.

37:37.094 --> 37:41.230
Hi.

38:14.097 --> 38:17.133
You're moving around a lot tonight.

38:18.202 --> 38:19.802
Wild Nights.

38:20.137 --> 38:22.171
Now the hospital.

38:22.906 --> 38:24.407
How's your friend Lacey?

38:24.409 --> 38:26.409
What are you doing here?
You got what you want.

38:26.411 --> 38:29.278
Except nobody called off the task force.

38:29.280 --> 38:31.314
I don't have any control over that.

38:31.316 --> 38:33.216
You know, that's funny...

38:33.817 --> 38:35.585
'Cause I thought your
brother-in-law was working it.

38:35.587 --> 38:39.922
When he got his badge, I bet little
Travis and Katie were so proud.

38:39.924 --> 38:41.389
You don't...

38:43.727 --> 38:46.395
Don't talk about my family.

38:47.698 --> 38:49.332
Little edgy?

38:50.500 --> 38:53.736
You know, I don't know if your
business has an exit strategy,

38:53.738 --> 38:58.307
but right now would be a really
good time to put it into play.

39:00.444 --> 39:02.878
Have you ever worked the pole?

39:07.451 --> 39:10.119
I bet you'd be really good at it.

39:22.933 --> 39:25.735
See you real soon, Mrs. Parks.

40:15.452 --> 40:16.952
Riley!

40:16.954 --> 40:18.688
What the hell are you doing?

40:18.690 --> 40:20.556
I've been calling you.

40:20.558 --> 40:22.758
Come on. Let's go inside. No.

40:22.760 --> 40:24.460
No, doesn't it feel good?

40:24.462 --> 40:28.464
I mean, like it's gonna
wash all of it right away.

40:28.466 --> 40:29.765
Riley, I know that you're in trouble.

40:29.767 --> 40:32.635
What the hell are you talking
about? I talked to Evan.

40:32.637 --> 40:33.569
He told me he's investigating

40:33.571 --> 40:35.538
some thug that you're
somehow connected to you.

40:35.540 --> 40:39.442
Why didn't you tell me any
of this? What is going on?

40:39.444 --> 40:40.343
I didn't want to worry you.

40:40.345 --> 40:42.445
You didn't want to worry
me? I'm already worried.

40:42.447 --> 40:44.280
But I can deal with
this, okay? On my own.

40:44.282 --> 40:45.648
Riley, you don't have to.

40:45.650 --> 40:47.516
That's what I'm saying. I'm here.

40:47.518 --> 40:48.784
All right? I'm not going anywhere.

40:48.786 --> 40:50.753
It's because you already left, Kyle!

40:50.755 --> 40:53.823
And you know what? For
the first time, I get it.

40:53.825 --> 40:56.325
I get just wanting to pack all your shit

40:56.327 --> 40:58.427
and just run away.

40:59.629 --> 41:00.663
But I can't leave.

41:00.665 --> 41:04.133
Just tell me what it is,
all right? I can accept it.

41:04.135 --> 41:05.935
I can't tell you.

41:05.937 --> 41:06.569
What?

41:06.571 --> 41:08.070
That night that I got arrested,

41:08.072 --> 41:09.572
you started to tell me something.

41:09.574 --> 41:11.107
What is... Is this what it is?

41:11.109 --> 41:12.742
I can't breathe!

41:12.744 --> 41:14.076
Riley!

41:15.679 --> 41:17.079
Riley!

41:24.521 --> 41:26.722
Riley, what are you doing?
