1:02:45.887 --> 1:02:46.888
Shit's strange…

1:02:48.014 --> 1:02:49.515
Amado. Way it went down…

1:02:51.100 --> 1:02:53.644
He's gone, not coming back.

1:02:53.728 --> 1:02:55.730
[sinister music playing]

1:02:58.274 --> 1:03:01.027
The future, it's ours. Belongs to Sinaloa.

1:03:09.160 --> 1:03:13.039
Might be time to rethink
your living arrangement.

1:03:15.833 --> 1:03:17.919
Brother, I need you back home.

[Walt in English] Look, I don't know
how much of this you wanna hear.

1:03:28.513 --> 1:03:29.597
[clears throat]

1:03:31.891 --> 1:03:33.601
I wasn't happy with who I was.

1:03:35.645 --> 1:03:39.148
Figured anyone that was close to me
would see that too.

1:03:39.690 --> 1:03:40.691
Sooner or later.

1:03:42.193 --> 1:03:44.237
So I went looking for something.

1:03:44.320 --> 1:03:46.614
Something that'd make me…

1:03:47.490 --> 1:03:49.742
I don't know, worthy.

1:03:50.326 --> 1:03:51.828
And the whole time, I'm just…

1:03:54.330 --> 1:03:58.626
making shit worse and hurting more people.

1:04:01.671 --> 1:04:02.713
Thank you.

1:04:05.716 --> 1:04:07.134
There is no fixing it.

1:04:08.386 --> 1:04:10.471
That's what I finally figured out.

1:04:14.559 --> 1:04:15.852
I don't know, look, I'm sorry.

1:04:15.935 --> 1:04:17.812
I know this is a lot to hit you with, but…

1:04:19.230 --> 1:04:21.274
That's why we go to the meetings, man.

1:04:24.527 --> 1:04:26.696
You get older, doesn't mean you get wiser.

1:04:26.779 --> 1:04:29.949
You know, I got two marriages.

1:04:31.242 --> 1:04:33.035
Daughter won't talk to me.

1:04:34.704 --> 1:04:36.330
Some grandkids I never met.

1:04:40.459 --> 1:04:43.963
Believe me when I tell you, man,
shit isn't easy.

1:04:46.799 --> 1:04:49.969
I mean, I've been out four years, okay?

1:04:51.095 --> 1:04:54.265
Still trying to make…
I'm still trying to make things right.

1:04:56.225 --> 1:04:57.226
Yeah.

1:04:58.436 --> 1:05:00.521
I know one thing.

1:05:02.106 --> 1:05:05.651
Seventy grand never hurts.

1:05:08.112 --> 1:05:09.322
No, it does not.

1:05:14.535 --> 1:05:15.453
Drive here?

1:05:17.163 --> 1:05:20.625
Yeah, truck's in the back.

1:05:23.044 --> 1:05:24.587
I'm gonna make a call.

1:05:27.214 --> 1:05:28.799
So go ahead and follow me.

1:05:29.508 --> 1:05:32.219
-Meet my other guy.
-Sounds good, Bobby.

1:05:32.303 --> 1:05:35.765
-Thanks.
-…with the check.

1:05:43.648 --> 1:05:45.358
[sighing]

1:05:57.161 --> 1:05:58.663
Target's making the call.

1:05:59.497 --> 1:06:00.539
Setting a meet.

1:06:01.165 --> 1:06:02.667
Stand by in the parking lot.
