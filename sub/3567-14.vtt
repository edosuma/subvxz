00:04.504 --> 00:09.374
- This doesn't look good at all.
- Whoa! Cool!

00:09.442 --> 00:11.810
- No, Steven!
- Don't get near that stuff!

00:11.878 --> 00:15.113
- Whoa! Steven's here!
- You have to be

00:15.215 --> 00:19.019
- careful, Steven!
- Why?

00:19.886 --> 00:24.523
- What is that stuff?
- It's the moss that Rose Quartz raised on the hill.

00:24.591 --> 00:29.203
- My Mom planted this stuff?
- Rose Quartz used to climb that hill every spring

00:29.238 --> 00:33.465
and tend to the moss at the top.
But now that Rose is gone,

00:33.533 --> 00:36.455
- the moss is on the move.
- It's lost.

00:36.456 --> 00:42.107
- It's not lost. It's gross.
- Yes, but Rose loved it anyway.

00:42.208 --> 00:45.928
She saw the beauty in
everything, no matter how gross.

00:45.929 --> 00:49.648
Fortunately, I know just
what to do in this situation.

00:54.153 --> 01:00.999
Ha-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-h!
Ha-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-h!

01:01.034 --> 01:03.161
This is why I get up
in the morning.

01:08.635 --> 01:12.137
- Is this... police tape?
- Isn't this great?!

01:12.138 --> 01:15.270
This way we don't
even have to use magic.

01:15.305 --> 01:19.570
Humans will just see this and walk away.

01:19.912 --> 01:25.116
- Don't hold back.
- I never... do!

01:29.389 --> 01:32.591
♪ fa la-la la-la ♪
♪ perfect! ♪

01:32.692 --> 01:36.561
Now we can come up with a plan
to move the moss back to its hill.

01:36.629 --> 01:42.567
Who wants to get
some lunch? Just me, then?

01:42.635 --> 01:47.339
<i>Nice.
# Gettin' me a P, gettin' me a ZA #</i>

01:47.440 --> 01:50.008
♪ gettin' me a p-p-p-p-pizza ♪

01:50.009 --> 01:52.577
♪ gettin' me a P, gettin' me a ZA ♪

01:52.645 --> 01:56.648
Hey, is that Lars? Lars!

01:56.749 --> 02:01.286
- Why now?
- Got a high five for you from wa-a-a-y

02:01.354 --> 02:06.258
- downto-o-o-o-wn! Ohhhhhh!
- No, Steven! No high fives!

02:06.326 --> 02:12.497
- Mmm, okay.
- Steven!

02:12.598 --> 02:16.268
So... how come you're not
at the big donut?

02:16.336 --> 02:21.173
I don't spend my whole life
at work. I do... other things.

02:21.240 --> 02:24.609
- Like standing against this wall?
- What does it look like?!

02:24.677 --> 02:28.547
- Looks like you're doing a lot of nothing.
- That's the plan, Ste-van.

02:28.648 --> 02:32.284
- Just playing it cool today, you know?
- We are so much alike.

02:32.352 --> 02:34.928
- Excuse me?
- You want to get a fresh pizza

02:34.929 --> 02:37.543
right out of the oven,
but you don't want to seem

02:37.544 --> 02:40.158
too desperate, right?
Well, there's no need to be ashamed.

02:40.226 --> 02:43.662
Just walk right in and ask.
That's what I always do.

02:43.763 --> 02:47.265
- Steven, don't go in there right now!
- Oh, hey!

02:47.333 --> 02:50.435
He opened the door, and there
was doggy doo everywhere.

02:50.436 --> 02:53.111
That's nasty.
I don't like nasty stuff.

02:53.112 --> 02:55.474
Isn't that Kiki's
sister and her friends?

02:55.541 --> 02:59.194
- Jenny, Sour Cream, and Buck Dewey.
- Oh. You know those guys?

02:59.229 --> 03:01.646
Not quite, but I'm sure
we'll hang at some point.

03:01.714 --> 03:05.417
- You should go in and talk to them.
- That's not how these things

03:05.485 --> 03:09.688
work, Steven! The plan is to keep
it cool and let them come to me.

03:09.756 --> 03:13.125
- Here they come.
- Aah! Steven, turn around! Act natural!

03:13.192 --> 03:17.562
- Tell dad I'll be back later.
- I don't think they saw you.

03:17.663 --> 03:21.299
Steven, you were blocking
me with your... big hair! Aaah!

03:21.367 --> 03:24.236
Sorry! I'll go
tell them to look over here!

03:24.303 --> 03:27.672
<i>Steven, no!
Don't go over there! I hate you!</i>

03:27.740 --> 03:31.877
- Muffins that are like this big.
- Those things are too sweet for me.

03:31.944 --> 03:36.668
- Hi! My name's Steven.
- Buck Dewey.

03:36.703 --> 03:38.894
- They call me "Sour Cream."
- I'm Jenny.

03:38.895 --> 03:42.012
<i>Aah, he's gonna wreck everything!</i>

03:42.047 --> 03:45.090
<i>What are they saying?
I can't hear them!</i>

03:45.191 --> 03:48.020
<i>Ugh! Why is he dancing?!</i>

03:48.021 --> 03:52.264
- No! My life is horrible!
- Hey, Lars!

03:52.331 --> 03:55.767
- Yo.
- They invited us along for a ride.

03:55.835 --> 03:58.537
Huh? W-wait a minute.
They? You?

03:58.604 --> 04:00.227
Steven, you got lucky.

04:00.228 --> 04:03.475
So, don't ruin this with
any of your lame shtick.

04:03.543 --> 04:08.213
Pyoo, pyoo!
You got it!

04:08.281 --> 04:11.683
- Hop on in, guys.
- Oh, yeah! Middle seat!

04:11.784 --> 04:16.555
- Where'd you get that rad shirt, Steven?
- I have no idea where

04:16.622 --> 04:21.271
- any of my clothes come from.
- Yeah, man. Livin' free. I like it.

04:21.305 --> 04:25.263
- Hey, check out my shirt.
- Oh. That snake is nasty.

04:25.331 --> 04:30.569
- Oh. Yeah. I hate snakes.
- Oh, what? That's too bad.

04:30.636 --> 04:33.438
Some snakes are pretty cool.

04:33.782 --> 04:36.241
Sounds like
it's time to buckle up!

04:36.309 --> 04:38.390
- Quit being lame, Steven.
- Hey, man,

04:38.391 --> 04:41.513
there's nothing lame
about seat-belt safety.

04:41.581 --> 04:46.284
- Car does not move till we're all buckled up.
- Yeah. Now let's get some

04:46.352 --> 04:48.743
spaced-out beats up in here.

04:48.744 --> 04:54.507
- Yeah. I can rave to this.
- Hey, this car's really cool, Jenny.

04:54.542 --> 04:57.362
It's just a delivery car
for my Dad's lame shop.

04:57.430 --> 05:02.134
- Makes me smell like pizza. Where to, y'all?
- I don't even know.

05:02.169 --> 05:05.523
<i>- Oh, can we stop by the big donut?
- That old place?</i>

05:05.558 --> 05:08.540
- Man, that place is a drag.
- But that's where Lars works.

05:08.608 --> 05:10.842
Quit it, Steven.

05:10.910 --> 05:12.455
You need some water?

05:12.456 --> 05:15.547
Funland arcade is the
best! Let's do that!

05:15.615 --> 05:19.843
Man, I beat all the "G's" in
there like 3 million times.

05:19.844 --> 05:21.253
No way!

05:21.320 --> 05:24.856
- Yeah. Me too.
- No way!

05:24.924 --> 05:28.870
Honestly, though, I'm just
exaggerating to sound cool.

05:28.915 --> 05:33.798
- I appreciate your honesty.
- Hey, Buck, isn't that your dad?

05:33.866 --> 05:36.618
<i>Another reason you
should re-elect me ...</i>

05:36.619 --> 05:39.371
<i>I love babies!
Will you look at that?</i>

05:39.472 --> 05:43.826
<i>A baby! Gonna kiss it.</i>

05:44.869 --> 05:49.739
- Hmm. I like his policies on babies.
- Man. He never kisses me like that.

05:49.774 --> 05:53.009
- That's rough, bro.
- It's not rough. The lack of daddy kisses

05:53.044 --> 05:57.881
- in my life made me who I am.
- Oh, my gosh, guys.

05:57.948 --> 06:02.266
- We should check out dead man's mouth.
- What's dead man's mouth?

06:02.301 --> 06:06.307
Oh, it's this lake where some
dude died or it looks like a mouth.

06:06.342 --> 06:11.307
- I forget the specifics.
- Dead man's mouth, here... we... come.

06:11.342 --> 06:14.913
<i>Sounds good to me!</i>

06:14.914 --> 06:16.699
We're here.

06:18.211 --> 06:22.539
Y-you know what?
I know this place may seem cool,

06:22.606 --> 06:25.782
but it's actually a lot
less cool than you think.

06:25.883 --> 06:30.140
Why don't we just go have
some more fun at the boardwalk?

06:30.141 --> 06:33.483
Steven, stop being lame.
Let's check this place out.

06:33.551 --> 06:35.035
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

06:35.036 --> 06:39.555
Oh! Pff!
The police tape!

06:40.691 --> 06:44.003
Huh. Police tape?

06:46.894 --> 06:50.588
- Awesome.
- I'm above the law.

06:51.274 --> 06:54.346
Who wants to go for a swim?

06:55.439 --> 07:00.810
Pants become shorts.

07:00.878 --> 07:04.514
Lars, don't go in there!

07:04.615 --> 07:07.517
- It's dangerous!
- Steven, you trying to scare us?

07:07.585 --> 07:10.687
Build an atmosphere.
I appreciate that.

07:10.688 --> 07:13.212
Ooooh.

07:13.213 --> 07:16.059
- Wait!
- I'm not that slow.

07:16.126 --> 07:19.549
Hey, what are you doing, man?!

07:19.550 --> 07:21.831
Don't!

07:21.932 --> 07:26.736
Steven... what... is...
your... deal?!

07:28.405 --> 07:34.393
<i>- Ugh. Ew!
- Ohh!</i>

07:36.780 --> 07:41.284
- Oh, no! Ugh!
- What's going on?!

07:41.352 --> 07:44.242
It's some kind of
magic moss my Mom planted!

07:44.243 --> 07:45.688
Wait. Your mom?

07:51.562 --> 07:53.496
Guys, hang on!

07:59.438 --> 08:01.337
Lars, I know what we have to do!

08:01.405 --> 08:03.273
This is all your fault!

08:03.274 --> 08:08.293
I knew if something went wrong
today, it would be because of you!

08:08.328 --> 08:10.997
Now I'm never going to be
friends with these guys,

08:11.032 --> 08:14.493
all because of your weird mom!

08:16.494 --> 08:18.751
What do you know about my Mom?!

08:18.786 --> 08:21.557
I didn't even get to know my Mom!

08:21.625 --> 08:25.662
But I do know she saw
beauty in everything,

08:25.663 --> 08:29.699
even in stuff like this
and even in jerks like you!

08:30.067 --> 08:33.544
Now help me get them to the car.

08:34.772 --> 08:40.941
- Hey!
- Lars, hurry!

08:42.046 --> 08:44.922
This moss belongs on
the top of that hill.

08:44.923 --> 08:47.837
Come on, Lars!
What are you waiting for?!

08:47.838 --> 08:50.720
Uh, Steven, I don't know
how to drive a stick shift!

08:50.788 --> 08:53.968
I'll work the stick.
You just keep us on the road.

08:54.119 --> 08:58.328
- Okay. All right. Let's do this. Ignition!
- Stick problem!

08:58.395 --> 09:02.448
- Steven, no! Put it in reverse!
- Is that the one with "R" on it?

09:03.567 --> 09:06.085
<i>- Jenny's gonna kill me!
- Whoa!</i>

09:07.697 --> 09:09.832
What's gonna happen when we
get to the top of that hill?

09:09.833 --> 09:11.574
- I don't know!
- You don't know?

09:11.675 --> 09:14.577
That's just where
the moss wants to be! Aah!

09:14.645 --> 09:16.402
Huh? Aaaaaah!

09:16.403 --> 09:19.916
<i>It's getting everywhere!</i>

09:22.641 --> 09:23.653
<i>We made it!</i>

09:23.721 --> 09:27.724
- We're almost there! What do we do now?
- We got to get up there!

09:27.791 --> 09:31.494
Hurry!

09:31.562 --> 09:35.031
Yeah! I'm... getting... stuck.
Ohh!

09:35.099 --> 09:40.068
- Oh! Don't give up!
- Steven?

09:40.126 --> 09:44.315
- What?
- This sucks. Ohhhhh!

09:44.316 --> 09:45.475
Lars!

The moss was
just trying to bloom.

10:05.583 --> 10:09.432
- Ugh. What happened?
- I think I died.

10:09.500 --> 10:14.558
<i>- Guys, look!
- Whoa!</i>

10:18.976 --> 10:23.728
- You can see all of Beach City from up here.
- It's beautiful.

10:23.763 --> 10:28.551
- Yeah. How did we even get up here?
- Well, Steven thought that ...

10:28.619 --> 10:30.286
Lars drove us here.

10:30.287 --> 10:32.681
- Yeah, Lars.
- Supercool.

10:32.716 --> 10:36.109
- You're cool, Lars.
- I can totally rave to this.

10:36.110 --> 10:37.709
<i>Go! Go! Go! Go!</i>

10:37.744 --> 10:41.264

Yeah!

10:46.089 --> 10:47.334
