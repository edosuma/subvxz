00:00.465 --> 00:02.124
<i>Previously on "Switched at birth..."</i>

00:02.390 --> 00:03.760
I'm coach Medlock. Do you have a second?

00:03.761 --> 00:05.845
I decided to take coach Medlock's offer.

00:05.846 --> 00:07.209
I'm gonna join the Buckner team.

00:08.355 --> 00:09.616
It's really nice to meet you.

00:14.803 --> 00:16.196
What was I supposed to do?

00:16.197 --> 00:18.278
Just watch you drop out of school?

00:19.959 --> 00:21.451
I went out on a limb
to put you on this team

00:21.452 --> 00:22.746
and I'm starting to regret that decision.

00:22.747 --> 00:24.346
You put me on the team because I'm deaf

00:24.347 --> 00:26.387
and the school gets disability funding.

00:26.388 --> 00:28.687
Do you guys wanna see if
we can save this team?

00:28.688 --> 00:31.480
- Come on.
- Daphne, it's good to have you back

00:31.481 --> 00:33.121
playing for The Mustangs.

00:48.062 --> 00:49.504
I'm sorry, everyone.

00:50.490 --> 00:53.609
Everybody, we...

00:53.610 --> 00:56.469
we had a fantastic season.

00:56.470 --> 00:58.175
Just fantastic.

01:00.810 --> 01:04.027
But Marshall didn't beat us. I blew it.

01:04.483 --> 01:07.560
I missed an easy layup and now it's over.

01:08.622 --> 01:11.568
No Springfield tournament.

01:12.710 --> 01:14.415
No more girls basketball.

01:15.194 --> 01:16.690
Hold on, we don't know that for sure.

01:16.691 --> 01:19.824
We do not know that they are
cancelling this program.

01:23.369 --> 01:24.945
I know. Yeah.

01:27.865 --> 01:28.857
Hey.

01:30.405 --> 01:31.657
I finished it.

01:32.914 --> 01:37.261
I wasn't sure if you needed it back.

01:42.711 --> 01:46.537
I told Ty that we're dating,

01:47.638 --> 01:49.681
and I should've told him a long time ago.

01:53.299 --> 01:55.233
Can we get past this?

01:55.514 --> 01:58.762
'cause someone's birthday is coming up.

02:01.970 --> 02:03.203
Come on!

02:03.270 --> 02:06.357
It is my turn to plan something amazing.

02:06.358 --> 02:08.437
And I have a few ideas...

02:08.573 --> 02:10.050
all of which are 100% legal.

02:20.903 --> 02:23.143
Yeah, what's happening with all that?

02:23.984 --> 02:25.581
Are you gonna stay with your dad?

02:33.385 --> 02:36.043
And I will visit you wherever you are.

02:43.771 --> 02:45.370
- Hey, hey.
- Hey.

02:45.609 --> 02:47.581
I got your text. What's going on?

02:47.742 --> 02:50.538
Um, well the Carlton athletic
director called me.

02:50.539 --> 02:52.300
It seems that the Marshall girls

02:52.301 --> 02:55.115
celebrated their momentous
victory in the locker room

02:55.911 --> 02:57.317
with champagne.

02:58.433 --> 03:00.323
They've been disqualified!

03:01.163 --> 03:02.426
Wait, what?

03:02.498 --> 03:04.290
They're out, we're in.

03:05.024 --> 03:08.661
- So we're going to Springfield?!
- We are going to Springfield!

03:10.934 --> 03:12.978
- Wait, it gets better.
- Yeah.

03:12.979 --> 03:16.748
We are playing the winner of
the west-side qualifying game...

03:19.655 --> 03:20.861
Buckner.

03:21.732 --> 03:23.207
- We're playing Buckner?
- Yeah.

03:23.208 --> 03:24.982
Oh yeah. Awkward.

03:25.610 --> 03:26.827
They're really good.

03:26.828 --> 03:29.899
We are going to wipe
the floor with those girls.

03:30.372 --> 03:31.504
Yeah, we are.

03:44.753 --> 03:45.908
Hi.

03:48.200 --> 03:50.583
Emmett's in history.

03:53.826 --> 03:54.923
Anything.

03:56.899 --> 03:59.759
It's about the... what situation?

03:59.965 --> 04:01.893
- Custody.
- Custody.

04:01.936 --> 04:02.919
Right.

04:03.432 --> 04:05.825
I thought Emmett gets to choose.

04:24.449 --> 04:25.425
Me?

04:26.969 --> 04:29.136
Need a statement from me

04:29.137 --> 04:31.354
about everything that I've seen.

04:36.610 --> 04:38.045
Melody, I...

04:59.809 --> 05:03.478
Mmm, told you it was
the best ice cream in the city.

05:03.479 --> 05:05.924
It's good, but we're gonna have
to eat a few more ice cream joints

05:05.925 --> 05:07.900
before I declare it the best.

05:07.901 --> 05:09.249
What, you're not gonna
take my word for it?

05:09.250 --> 05:11.421
Then I wouldn't have
an excuse to see you again.

05:12.221 --> 05:15.680
Then I guess we'll have
to find another time to grab a cone.

05:18.424 --> 05:19.362
Uh.

05:20.320 --> 05:22.805
Okay, I've tried every form

05:22.806 --> 05:24.789
of nonverbal communication I know...

05:24.790 --> 05:26.001
The subtle hand brush,

05:26.002 --> 05:28.647
leaving my knee next to
yours a little too long...

05:28.805 --> 05:31.177
And I swear you've initiated
a hand brush or two yourself,

05:31.178 --> 05:33.256
so I don't get it.

05:36.286 --> 05:40.284
My ex... whatever he was...

05:40.285 --> 05:42.132
came back into my life a few months ago,

05:42.133 --> 05:45.679
and then he disappeared again and...

05:45.712 --> 05:47.071
So you and I...

05:47.072 --> 05:48.430
I'm just not ready.

05:53.762 --> 05:55.542
I mean it wouldn't be fair to you.

05:56.006 --> 05:57.471
You don't have to worry about me.

06:03.485 --> 06:06.637
Okay, this is more difficult
than it should be.

06:07.521 --> 06:10.583
- But I...
- I'm banking on you

06:10.584 --> 06:13.639
thinking that's romantic
and not littering.

06:21.422 --> 06:23.141
- Honey?
- Yeah.

06:23.142 --> 06:25.559
Remember when Craig Tebbe
told us about his friend?

06:25.560 --> 06:27.433
- You know, the editor in New York...
- Yeah.

06:27.434 --> 06:28.978
- Rya Bellows?
- Uh-huh.

06:29.067 --> 06:33.287
Apparently she read my proposal
and she wants to meet with me.

06:34.071 --> 06:35.264
Really? That's great.

06:35.265 --> 06:37.833
I knew it. I knew that they would like it!

06:37.834 --> 06:40.079
It's only a meeting and the problem is

06:40.092 --> 06:42.174
she's only in town
this Thursday afternoon,

06:42.175 --> 06:45.543
so if I see her,
I might be late for the tournament.

06:45.544 --> 06:48.998
- So you'll be late.
- What if the meeting goes long?

06:48.999 --> 06:52.868
Or there's traffic?
I mean I can just talk to her on the phone.

06:52.869 --> 06:54.982
It's such late notice. She'd understand.

06:54.983 --> 06:57.894
Kathryn, it's a game, it's not a good
enough reason to, you know, cancel.

06:57.895 --> 07:00.931
Honey, it's not just a game,
it's a tournament.

07:00.932 --> 07:03.407
Okay, well, if you're
scared then, you know...

07:03.408 --> 07:05.276
- I'm not scared.
- Great.

07:05.356 --> 07:06.997
Then you get there when you get there.

07:10.259 --> 07:11.711
- Okay.
- Mmm.

07:37.299 --> 07:39.427
We know you can do it, Daphne.

08:26.947 --> 08:29.507
You asked Bay to what?

08:29.614 --> 08:31.425
I just found out myself.

08:33.202 --> 08:35.442
Bay is the only one with
first-hand knowledge

08:35.443 --> 08:37.398
of what's been going on over there.

08:37.756 --> 08:41.371
But even so, you can't put
her in that kind of position.

08:41.480 --> 08:43.511
Why didn't you talk to me first

08:43.513 --> 08:46.159
before ambushing Bay?

08:47.760 --> 08:49.664
I just hung up with my attorney,

08:50.576 --> 08:53.331
I saw her on campus and it came out.

08:54.949 --> 08:55.897
I'm sorry.

08:55.898 --> 08:58.042
I should've talked to you both first.

09:00.939 --> 09:03.643
If I could do it any other way,

09:03.802 --> 09:05.882
I would. I promise.

09:20.085 --> 09:21.809
Hey. Hi...

09:22.226 --> 09:23.253
Bay!

09:24.026 --> 09:25.733
Melody came to see me and I wanted to...

09:25.734 --> 09:29.116
I appreciate the offer,
but I don't want to talk about it.

09:29.117 --> 09:30.517
I don't need someone to give

09:30.518 --> 09:33.426
me advice or someone
to bounce ideas off of.

09:33.809 --> 09:35.469
I've got it under control, okay?

09:35.666 --> 09:36.776
Okay.

09:39.202 --> 09:40.367
So what should I do?

09:41.252 --> 09:43.966
- You really can't win.
- I knew it.

09:49.413 --> 09:52.082
Can you take my place?

09:52.819 --> 09:54.464
Words I never thought I'd say to you.

09:55.570 --> 09:58.804
I mean, have you seen anything
that you could testify to?

09:58.805 --> 10:02.263
I've barely been to his dad's
place since he moved out,

10:02.524 --> 10:04.619
and I've never even met the girlfriend.

10:04.651 --> 10:06.408
Kind of a kook job.

10:06.744 --> 10:09.708
Look, maybe I'm saying this

10:09.709 --> 10:12.924
because Melody is like
a second mom to me...

10:12.925 --> 10:16.647
or third mom, I guess.

10:16.702 --> 10:19.938
Whatever. Anyway, that's where he belongs.

10:20.246 --> 10:21.730
I wouldn't force it.

10:22.024 --> 10:23.133
All he needs now

10:23.134 --> 10:26.101
is just a gentle push
in the right direction.

10:26.654 --> 10:28.732
Without pissing anyone off.

10:29.454 --> 10:30.755
No pressure.

10:33.292 --> 10:36.246
Hey, Emmett's going to my tournament,

10:36.247 --> 10:38.485
so I'll try to nudge him too.

10:38.495 --> 10:42.924
Oh, I'm sorry... I totally
spaced on congratulating you.

10:42.925 --> 10:46.443
- Oh.
- I feel bad I can't go.

10:46.748 --> 10:50.433
We have to get permission from
our teachers to miss class

10:50.434 --> 10:53.690
and my english teacher's being a bitch.

10:53.795 --> 10:56.636
So hey, good luck.

10:57.254 --> 10:58.398
Thanks.

11:07.039 --> 11:08.039
Hey.

11:09.637 --> 11:11.724
So any chance

11:11.725 --> 11:14.498
you wanna come down to
Springfield and cheer me on?

11:16.130 --> 11:17.222
I have a physics test on

11:17.223 --> 11:18.483
Friday and they're not letting anybody go.

11:18.484 --> 11:20.938
Look, I feel like I screwed things up

11:20.939 --> 11:23.502
and I really wanna make this work.

11:24.552 --> 11:25.854
It would mean a lot to me,

11:27.071 --> 11:30.984
and I got a hotel room to myself.

11:32.784 --> 11:34.406
Have you ever had chicken pox?

11:34.580 --> 11:37.165
'cause you could come down
with a really bad case

11:37.166 --> 11:38.502
tomorrow afternoon.

11:41.759 --> 11:42.883
So?

11:44.730 --> 11:45.828
So...

11:48.074 --> 11:49.238
I'll think about it.

11:57.940 --> 12:00.204
Hello? Patrick?

12:01.500 --> 12:03.720
Oh, sorry no. I can't go to breakfast.

12:03.721 --> 12:05.431
I'm getting Daphne ready for school...

12:05.870 --> 12:07.988
or she's getting me ready for work.

12:09.102 --> 12:10.090
You are?

12:10.500 --> 12:11.990
So when the collector canceled,

12:11.991 --> 12:13.321
I was stuck with all these bagels.

12:13.322 --> 12:15.832
Then I realized I'm only
a couple of blocks away.

12:15.833 --> 12:18.475
I hope you like lox.

12:19.191 --> 12:20.343
What's lox?

12:25.512 --> 12:26.676
Look at him,

12:26.709 --> 12:29.548
he totally thinks that we just
fell off the turnip truck.

12:29.549 --> 12:31.547
We love lox!

12:33.015 --> 12:35.829
I'll ship in a pound from
my place in Brooklyn.

12:35.830 --> 12:38.253
It's like orange velvet.

12:38.772 --> 12:42.151
You're the guy who opened
that art gallery, right?

12:42.251 --> 12:43.931
I loved the show.

12:44.567 --> 12:46.293
Well, how could you not?

12:51.001 --> 12:54.552
Uh, you better get going
or you're gonna be late.

12:55.305 --> 12:57.274
It was really nice to meet you.

12:57.275 --> 12:58.437
You too.

12:58.983 --> 13:00.908
- Bye, mom.
- Bye.

13:03.715 --> 13:05.527
- She's great.
- Thanks,

13:05.528 --> 13:07.472
but you can't do this.

13:07.473 --> 13:10.179
- Do what?
- Stop by and meet my kid.

13:10.444 --> 13:11.812
Yeah, but it went well, didn't it?

13:11.813 --> 13:14.595
I wasn't ready for her to know
that I was dating someone.

13:15.456 --> 13:17.774
Sorry, I just assumed
you'd told her already.

13:17.775 --> 13:19.097
Well, I hadn't.

13:19.654 --> 13:20.650
Okay.

13:21.657 --> 13:23.424
So I should nix my plan

13:23.425 --> 13:25.669
to show up tonight unannounced
with take-out chinese?

13:34.618 --> 13:37.538
It's not exactly against him.

13:37.539 --> 13:41.072
It's against the circumstances

13:41.073 --> 13:43.201
that he put you in.

13:49.632 --> 13:51.391
I don't. I got put there.

13:54.179 --> 13:56.115
I don't want to pick sides,

13:56.116 --> 13:58.508
but your mom can be kind of convincing.

14:10.865 --> 14:12.462
The island of Bay?

14:23.944 --> 14:25.092
I promise.

14:25.382 --> 14:26.398
Okay?

14:28.032 --> 14:29.347
Are you gonna be okay?

14:46.331 --> 14:47.030
Hello.

14:47.031 --> 14:49.884
The calder opening
at Crystal Bridges.

14:49.911 --> 14:51.087
Hello?

14:51.231 --> 14:53.781
- It's Patrick.
- Yeah, I got that.

14:53.995 --> 14:55.609
The new museum in Arkansas...

14:55.610 --> 14:57.492
the one the Walmart heiress just opened.

14:57.493 --> 14:59.180
It's on like three ponds.

14:59.214 --> 15:01.449
Yeah, I know about it.
It's supposed to be stunning.

15:01.643 --> 15:04.224
- Are you going to the opening?
- We'going.

15:04.225 --> 15:05.062
And there's this great

15:05.063 --> 15:06.902
little bed and breakfast
a few blocks away.

15:06.903 --> 15:09.133
I was going to book separate
rooms unless, of course,

15:09.134 --> 15:11.675
there was only one room available.

15:12.218 --> 15:13.940
Oh um...

15:13.941 --> 15:16.227
- When is it?
- Tomorrow night.

15:16.430 --> 15:19.173
Oh. I'm gonna be at
Daphne's basketball game.

15:19.174 --> 15:21.846
- That's too bad.
- Seriously,

15:21.847 --> 15:24.594
Ed Ruscha is gonna be there.
John Baldessari.

15:25.049 --> 15:26.890
I can't miss her game.

15:29.554 --> 15:32.756
- Patrick?
- No no, I get it.

15:33.057 --> 15:35.362
You've never dated a single
mother before, have you?

15:35.741 --> 15:36.836
No.

15:37.057 --> 15:39.103
It's not fair to ask you to understand.

15:40.081 --> 15:42.436
You know what? I need to finish
packing for the tournament.

15:42.437 --> 15:44.886
Um, you have a good time
at the opening, okay?

15:44.887 --> 15:46.662
- Okay. Bye.
- Bye.

15:54.474 --> 15:55.801
Racking up the kills?

15:55.947 --> 15:57.433
It's a racing game,

15:57.434 --> 15:59.825
so just a few flat tires.

15:59.826 --> 16:02.288
Uh-huh. I need a guy's opinion.

16:03.857 --> 16:05.015
Emmett's birthday is coming up

16:05.016 --> 16:07.825
and I want to get him something amazing.

16:07.894 --> 16:10.119
And he's been building
a motorcycle with his dad,

16:10.120 --> 16:11.692
but he still needs a fender.

16:11.693 --> 16:13.916
I found a place that sells parts

16:14.334 --> 16:17.110
and I thought I'd paint
something really cool on it.

16:18.864 --> 16:19.622
Or option two...

16:19.623 --> 16:21.326
there's this book I could get him...

16:21.327 --> 16:22.926
- The fender.
- I agree.

16:24.439 --> 16:26.541
I just need a favor from you.

16:42.789 --> 16:44.528
Ah okay, so we just

16:44.932 --> 16:47.800
need to look at the tire so I can make
sure I get the right size.

16:47.801 --> 16:49.966
You're really getting him
a fender for his birthday?

16:50.845 --> 16:52.718
Well, he's been looking for one.

16:52.954 --> 16:53.578
Just kidding.

16:53.579 --> 16:55.378
You're the coolest girlfriend ever.

16:55.379 --> 16:57.354
Seriously, the only thing I ever
got my high school boyfriend

16:57.355 --> 16:59.440
lasted like five minutes.

17:01.323 --> 17:04.444
I think there's a measuring
tape or something over there.

17:04.612 --> 17:06.656
It's cool. I just need to check
out the side of the tire,

17:06.656 --> 17:09.179
get the numbers and check
out the mounting bolts.

17:09.536 --> 17:12.353
I don't speak bike,
but it sounds good.

17:13.741 --> 17:16.273
I'm just gonna go take this.

17:16.318 --> 17:18.637
Oh, we'll be done in like two seconds.

17:18.638 --> 17:19.603
Cool.

17:22.299 --> 17:23.818
She enjoys

17:23.819 --> 17:26.002
sharing details about
her high school sex life.

17:29.820 --> 17:32.177
I am not seeing any numbers.

17:32.472 --> 17:34.154
- What do you mean?
- I don't know,

17:34.155 --> 17:35.209
they're rubbed off or something.

17:35.210 --> 17:37.543
Um, look for the tape measure.

17:43.536 --> 17:45.200
Bay, uh...

17:45.922 --> 17:46.907
What's wrong?

17:54.174 --> 17:56.090
- You think they're selling it?
- There are a lot of baggies.

17:56.091 --> 17:58.294
So that was my boss from the restaurant...

17:59.798 --> 18:01.186
That is not mine!

18:01.353 --> 18:02.668
I'm just holding it for a

18:02.669 --> 18:04.761
friend who's in between
apartments right now.

18:04.762 --> 18:06.261
It's none of our business
and I think we're good.

18:06.262 --> 18:07.420
- Right, Tob?
- Yeah, we're good.

18:07.421 --> 18:11.140
Uh, please don't say anything
about this to Melody.

18:11.141 --> 18:12.965
She's just gonna use it against Cameron

18:12.966 --> 18:16.124
and it's gonna kill him
if he loses Emmett.

18:22.202 --> 18:23.940
Kennish, two rooms.

18:25.631 --> 18:27.837
Wow, this is so cool.

18:27.926 --> 18:29.049
Yeah. Hi.

18:46.443 --> 18:49.546
Hi, Haley. Are you a basketball player?

18:50.238 --> 18:52.953
- Ohhh.
- They drove here from Indiana...

18:52.954 --> 18:54.503
- Wow.
- To see the game.

18:55.617 --> 18:58.205
Actually we just met
people in the bathroom

18:58.242 --> 19:00.469
that came here from Houston.

19:00.470 --> 19:02.982
- Wow, really?
- Wow.

19:03.074 --> 19:06.077
We're here rooting for you... all of us.

19:06.310 --> 19:08.639
Thank you. Thank you so much.

19:08.640 --> 19:10.033
Thank you, bye.

19:10.034 --> 19:11.006
Thank you.

19:12.252 --> 19:14.521
That is unbelievable.

19:14.788 --> 19:16.457
That is so inspiring.

19:16.777 --> 19:18.699
You're like a rock star to them.

19:19.131 --> 19:21.844
Yeah. You know, maybe we should schedule

19:21.845 --> 19:24.449
an extra practice,
run some of the new plays.

19:24.582 --> 19:26.239
Yeah, I think that's an excellent idea.

19:26.240 --> 19:29.545
I'll schedule us some more court time.
Thanks very much.

20:36.541 --> 20:38.597
Let's go back there.
Look at the face.

20:42.323 --> 20:44.503
- What time did we have the court?
- Right now.

20:45.954 --> 20:47.213
All right, girls, off the court.

20:47.214 --> 20:50.408
And don't dawdle in the shower.
Massages are in 15 minutes.

20:52.569 --> 20:54.686
Ladies, we start with
layup drills, please.

20:55.336 --> 20:57.725
Jerry, free throws after that, okay?

20:58.959 --> 21:00.627
- Coach Kennish?
- Yeah.

21:00.628 --> 21:01.804
I need to talk to you.

21:01.805 --> 21:03.696
I'm a little busy right now.
Can we do it later?

21:03.697 --> 21:06.098
There's been a complaint lodged
against one of your players.

21:06.099 --> 21:09.120
That is such a desperate act,
to disqualify our star player

21:09.121 --> 21:10.238
- at the beginning of a tournament.
- Now hold on, hold on!

21:10.239 --> 21:11.610
We didn't know about
this until right now.

21:11.611 --> 21:12.521
It was an anonymous tip.

21:12.522 --> 21:14.522
Anonymous? It was him
or one of his players!

21:14.523 --> 21:16.982
- What's going on?
- It's a violation of tournament code.

21:16.983 --> 21:20.141
He says that Daphne can't play

21:20.142 --> 21:22.412
because she switched teams.

21:23.480 --> 21:25.055
Players have to have been
members of their team

21:25.056 --> 21:28.131
for six consecutive weeks
or they can't participate.

21:29.464 --> 21:31.830
She wants me to interpret for her.

21:33.491 --> 21:36.068
Hundreds of deaf people came from all over

21:36.069 --> 21:37.495
to see these girls play.

21:38.257 --> 21:40.286
Daphne is a role model to them.

21:40.822 --> 21:43.659
There's a whole community out
there rooting for this team.

21:43.660 --> 21:47.990
Do you understand that?
Do you really want to let them down?

21:47.991 --> 21:49.564
Do you really want to tell them

21:49.565 --> 21:53.245
that we disqualified our best
player on a technicality?

22:00.282 --> 22:03.251
You know what? We're fine with it.

22:03.252 --> 22:04.849
- Good.
- Totally fine with it.

22:05.453 --> 22:08.798
Okay, game will proceed as planned.

22:08.799 --> 22:10.286
Excellent. Let's go.

22:11.836 --> 22:12.811
Thank you.

22:16.203 --> 22:19.741
"It's about mistakes,
accidents, errors in judgment"

22:19.742 --> 22:22.364
"and how these moments define who we are"

22:22.365 --> 22:24.900
- "and the paths we take."
- Great.

22:25.227 --> 22:26.414
I mean, I lived through it

22:26.415 --> 22:27.916
and you're making me
want to read about it.

22:27.917 --> 22:29.864
- Really?
- Yeah. Keep going.

22:30.710 --> 22:34.442
Okay. "So when we were told
by the genetic counselor"

22:34.443 --> 22:37.720
"that there was a 99% chance
that Bay was not related to us,"

22:37.721 --> 22:39.535
"I looked at my daughter"

22:39.698 --> 22:42.336
"with her proud ringlets
and her fiery eyes..."

22:42.337 --> 22:46.202
You're okay with "Proud ringlets
and fiery eyes," right, Bay?

22:48.294 --> 22:49.444
Sorry. What?

22:49.496 --> 22:53.246
I was trying to be literary.
But if you hate it, I can change it.

22:53.247 --> 22:55.612
- Uh, dad's calling.
- Bay.

22:55.615 --> 22:58.213
What's going on? Is this about Melody?

22:58.333 --> 23:00.227
- Tell me.
- I'll get it.

23:00.280 --> 23:01.237
Bay.

23:04.547 --> 23:05.582
Hey, it's me.

23:07.095 --> 23:07.884
How's it going out there?

23:07.885 --> 23:10.345
One of the Buckner players
tried to get Daphne

23:10.346 --> 23:12.826
- kicked off the team.
- What? Why?

23:12.827 --> 23:16.741
Some made-up reason.
It was, quote, "An anonymous tip"

23:16.742 --> 23:18.699
that she hadn't been on
the Carlton team long enough.

23:18.700 --> 23:20.504
- We took care of it though.
- That sucks. Who would do that?

23:20.505 --> 23:22.387
Someone who's threatened by Daphne

23:22.388 --> 23:24.704
or holds some kind of
grudge against her, I guess.

23:25.491 --> 23:26.807
We'll talk about it later.

23:27.269 --> 23:29.042
Then, honey, you have to do something.

23:29.085 --> 23:32.966
If I do tell someone what I saw,

23:32.967 --> 23:33.721
then Emmett's dad could

23:33.722 --> 23:35.864
lose custody and that
would destroy Emmett.

23:35.865 --> 23:39.060
But if I don't say anything and
something happens to Emmett

23:39.061 --> 23:41.539
because of what I saw...
then that's my fault.

23:42.627 --> 23:43.958
Bay honey, you're worrying me.

23:43.959 --> 23:44.899
And if I don't make the statement,

23:44.900 --> 23:46.924
then Melody is going to hate me.

23:46.925 --> 23:48.393
And if I do make the statement,

23:48.394 --> 23:50.007
then Emmett is never gonna forgive me.

23:50.008 --> 23:52.206
It's a custody-battle checkmate.

23:52.357 --> 23:55.463
I'm sure whatever you decide,
Emmett will understand.

23:55.464 --> 23:59.824
No, he won't. Mom, he made
me promise to stay out of it.

23:59.825 --> 24:03.853
And I think he's so mad at Melody
over the whole motorcycle thing

24:03.854 --> 24:07.174
that he can't see clearly.

24:08.021 --> 24:09.055
Listen to me.

24:09.892 --> 24:13.304
If you care about him and
he's really in trouble,

24:14.047 --> 24:16.240
you have to say something to someone.

24:16.989 --> 24:18.668
No matter what the cost?

24:37.559 --> 24:40.658
Hey, I heard about what happened.

24:41.074 --> 24:44.476
- I'm really glad it worked out.
- I'm sure you are.

24:45.229 --> 24:46.190
I am!

24:47.085 --> 24:48.182
Wait, you... wait, do you

24:48.183 --> 24:50.341
think that I was
the one who ratted you out?

24:51.065 --> 24:52.128
It doesn't matter.

24:52.256 --> 24:54.708
- No, it wasn't me.
- Yeah,

24:54.709 --> 24:57.286
because you would never
play dirty like that.

24:57.287 --> 25:00.332
Daphne, it's only fun to
win when it's competitive.

25:00.613 --> 25:02.436
You and me are the same that way.

25:03.667 --> 25:04.638
I mean it.

25:09.895 --> 25:10.903
I miss you.

25:12.597 --> 25:14.652
Maybe after the season is behind us,

25:14.653 --> 25:16.342
we can call a truce and hang out.

25:18.332 --> 25:19.647
I don't know.

25:20.628 --> 25:21.951
Let's see how it goes.

25:23.582 --> 25:26.464
The second Kennish I've had
to beg for forgiveness today.

25:26.796 --> 25:28.769
- What?
- Nothing.

25:29.801 --> 25:31.008
I'll see you on the court.

25:52.891 --> 25:54.970
Look, I'm not trying to
get anybody in troub...

26:03.371 --> 26:06.394
I can tell this is still about
Olivia and honestly it's not...

26:15.822 --> 26:18.771
No, look, even if Melody
hadn't come to me,

26:19.621 --> 26:21.118
I'm worried about Emmett.

26:21.876 --> 26:23.074
All the fighting...

26:23.375 --> 26:25.596
he thinks that it's his fault,

26:25.664 --> 26:27.259
he hasn't been himself lately and

26:27.260 --> 26:29.246
honestly I'm afraid about
what he's gonna do next.

26:31.936 --> 26:33.559
What? Olivia move out?

26:33.560 --> 26:36.500
Okay, now I just feel like
I'm getting deeper and deeper here.

26:44.232 --> 26:45.217
Win?

26:45.860 --> 26:48.166
I came here because I care about Emmett

26:48.166 --> 26:49.985
and all you care about is winning?

26:51.670 --> 26:53.045
No, that's great.

26:53.046 --> 26:56.334
He's probably never going to
talk to me again, but no biggie.

26:56.335 --> 27:00.091
You get to win the battle with
Melody and I get to lose Emmett.

27:07.382 --> 27:09.218
"Accidents, errors in judgment"

27:09.411 --> 27:11.914
"and how these moments define who we are"

27:11.954 --> 27:14.086
"and the paths we take."

27:16.148 --> 27:20.074
You know, I think your readers will relate

27:20.075 --> 27:21.513
to the challenges I've faced

27:21.514 --> 27:23.886
even if their children
weren't switched at birth.

27:23.978 --> 27:25.016
And if they were switched,

27:25.017 --> 27:27.452
then this is definitely the book for them.

27:27.453 --> 27:30.400
- You don't have to sell me.
- Oh wow.

27:30.906 --> 27:31.583
You didn't have to come

27:31.584 --> 27:33.093
all the way out here just to tell me that.

27:33.094 --> 27:37.042
Under ordinary circumstances,
your book would be a slam dunk.

27:37.824 --> 27:39.241
Ordinary circumstances?

27:39.242 --> 27:42.391
We know there's another book
being written by a journalist.

27:43.382 --> 27:44.364
Sarah Lazar.

27:44.365 --> 27:47.659
And there's a good chance
she gets her book out before you do,

27:47.660 --> 27:50.857
which is why we need not just your story

27:50.952 --> 27:52.689
but the other mother's as well.

27:52.690 --> 27:54.620
But I thought you said
you loved my proposal.

27:54.621 --> 27:58.120
We feel that hearing both your stories...

27:58.121 --> 28:01.737
two mothers' perspectives...
is even more compelling.

28:02.387 --> 28:05.151
- Yeah but...
- Unless you get Regina on board,

28:05.466 --> 28:07.457
I'm afraid it's too much of a risk.

28:16.914 --> 28:18.571
You nervous about the game tomorrow?

28:28.723 --> 28:29.541
I know.

28:37.121 --> 28:39.110
Oh, I don't think it's gonna work out.

28:41.634 --> 28:44.657
I do, but he's not a parent.

28:45.146 --> 28:46.542
He doesn't understand

28:46.543 --> 28:50.067
Why I can't just take off for the weekend

28:50.068 --> 28:52.301
or have a spontaneous breakfast.

29:03.060 --> 29:09.148
No matter how many times
he disappears or disappoints me,

29:09.183 --> 29:11.150
he has a hold on me.

29:16.699 --> 29:19.264
I don't want it. I swear.

29:19.264 --> 29:20.835
I want him out of my life.

29:23.640 --> 29:25.741
Well, I don't know about him either.

29:27.611 --> 29:30.564
Seriously, dating sucks.

30:31.867 --> 30:33.943
Daphne? Daphne?

30:33.943 --> 30:36.940
What the hell are you doing?
I've been looking all over for you.

30:36.940 --> 30:39.992
- You gotta get in bed.
- I'm okay.

30:39.992 --> 30:41.183
No no,

30:41.975 --> 30:44.598
listen to me, as
your coach and as your father,

30:44.598 --> 30:48.956
- I'm telling you...
- And I'm telling you you don't understand.

30:48.956 --> 30:50.269
I don't understand?

30:50.269 --> 30:52.546
I was a professional athlete for 15 years.

30:52.546 --> 30:56.170
I know what it means to want
something so bad for yourself.

30:56.170 --> 30:57.564
I don't want this for me.

31:00.344 --> 31:04.447
Okay, I... I guess I don't understand.

31:08.567 --> 31:11.469
Emmett's deafness

31:11.503 --> 31:13.672
defines him.

31:13.706 --> 31:16.275
Melody too.

31:17.037 --> 31:19.271
But I'm just Daphne.

31:19.305 --> 31:22.308
If I were hearing, I'd still be me...
just a hearing Daphne.

31:23.877 --> 31:28.219
But like it or not, I represent.

31:28.219 --> 31:30.282
- We all do.
- Every team represents their school.

31:30.317 --> 31:32.084
No.

31:33.737 --> 31:39.343
I represent every parent at our school,

31:39.742 --> 31:42.043
every little sister and brother,

31:42.078 --> 31:44.779
their uncle who teaches at Gallaudet

31:44.813 --> 31:47.181
and their deaf brother-in-law
who lives in Japan

31:47.216 --> 31:49.817
and heard about the game and emailed me.

31:52.154 --> 31:55.366
When you're part of
a small community,it's...

31:55.366 --> 31:56.824
it's fantastic,

31:57.860 --> 31:59.994
you have all these benefits.

32:00.029 --> 32:04.031
You go anywhere, you see someone deaf...
instant friends.

32:06.935 --> 32:08.803
But it also means

32:08.837 --> 32:11.639
that everything you do

32:11.639 --> 32:13.874
means something.

32:20.152 --> 32:23.888
Sometimes I just wish I could be Daphne.

32:24.597 --> 32:25.776
Not deaf,

32:26.113 --> 32:28.081
not hearing,

32:29.150 --> 32:31.218
just a girl playing basketball.

32:39.126 --> 32:42.233
Welcome to the Springfield division 3 finals.

32:44.159 --> 32:45.965
Buckner Bulldogs versus

32:46.054 --> 32:49.007
the surprising Carlton Mustangs.

32:52.277 --> 32:56.180
Ladies, I want you to look around

32:56.215 --> 32:59.853
this room. I want you to think back

32:59.853 --> 33:01.741
to the beginning of our season.

33:01.741 --> 33:06.157
Did any of you imagine that
you would be here playing today?

33:06.191 --> 33:08.159
'cause you know what? I didn't.

33:08.446 --> 33:09.925
When I started with you all,

33:09.925 --> 33:13.497
I did not know what you were capable of.

33:14.649 --> 33:17.335
But each and every one of you,
you showed me.

33:21.205 --> 33:24.375
Now let's go out there
and show everybody else.

33:25.464 --> 33:26.210
Okay?

33:26.244 --> 33:28.312
- One two three.
- Rah!

33:38.522 --> 33:40.423
Tipoff goes to Carlton.

33:49.434 --> 33:52.502
Oh, wrong-way pass from Vasquez.

33:52.881 --> 33:57.173
And it's an easy fast break for
her old teammate Simone Sinclair.

34:00.640 --> 34:03.152
Guess it was a good thing
I couldn't get you thrown out.

34:05.449 --> 34:07.535
Time-out, time-out, time-out!

34:09.554 --> 34:12.156
- Come on in. It's okay.
- Time-out Carlton.

34:12.190 --> 34:14.492
This could be a long
game for The Mustangs.

34:16.228 --> 34:17.428
Here she is.

34:18.754 --> 34:20.331
And this is Emmett.

34:22.100 --> 34:24.068
Patrick... you're here?

34:24.101 --> 34:25.652
And with Kathryn.

34:25.654 --> 34:29.072
I was circling the gym looking
for you and she took pity on me.

34:29.107 --> 34:31.341
He looked like a lost Carlton fan, so...

34:31.376 --> 34:33.310
Which I am.

34:33.849 --> 34:35.145
What about Crystal Bridges?

34:35.815 --> 34:37.895
I went, I schmoozed and I realized

34:37.895 --> 34:39.483
I'd rather be spending
the weekend with you.

34:40.408 --> 34:43.018
Oh.

34:45.561 --> 34:47.762
Just be a girl with the ball, okay?

34:47.795 --> 34:49.935
All right, just tune it out.

34:49.935 --> 34:52.342
- Okay.
- You're gonna be fine.

34:52.342 --> 34:54.226
Fine, okay?

34:59.831 --> 35:00.543
Here we go.

35:07.496 --> 35:08.956
- Yes!
- Yes!

36:53.401 --> 36:55.221
It all comes down to this.

36:55.221 --> 36:57.188
With 15 seconds left,

36:57.223 --> 36:59.023
Buckner is up by three.

37:02.428 --> 37:04.396
- Carlton steals the inbound pass.
- Yes!

37:04.430 --> 37:06.298
Come on, right here!

37:08.101 --> 37:10.269
And it's an easy layup for two.

37:10.867 --> 37:12.298
Buckner leads by one

37:12.298 --> 37:15.134
with only 10 seconds to go.

37:15.168 --> 37:17.069
Run out the clock. Run out the clock!

37:18.271 --> 37:20.206
Seven, six,

37:20.973 --> 37:21.893
five...

37:23.205 --> 37:26.041
- Let's go, bring it down!
- Three, two...

37:27.641 --> 37:28.824
Foul foul!

37:28.985 --> 37:31.370
- What was that?
- Simone, what the hell are you doing?

37:31.370 --> 37:32.967
That's a shooting foul.

37:32.967 --> 37:35.265
Carlton is going to the free throw line.

37:34.226 --> 37:35.846
What does that mean? Is the game over?

37:35.846 --> 37:36.521
- No
- No,

37:36.521 --> 37:38.480
she gets to shoot two free throws.

37:39.072 --> 37:40.828
Sorry, I'm a baseball wife.

37:41.054 --> 37:43.402
Vasquez heads to the free throw line

37:43.402 --> 37:46.793
and the game is on her shoulders.

38:56.333 --> 38:58.468
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

39:23.894 --> 39:26.829
What did I tell you?
I knew you could do it.

39:28.751 --> 39:31.211
So listen, next year,
we gotta bring buses down here.

39:31.211 --> 39:34.422
We gotta get more people,
'cause we are coming back!

39:36.016 --> 39:37.535
What? What'd I say?

39:39.260 --> 39:40.627
Let's discuss it on Monday.

39:42.168 --> 39:43.498
But we won.

39:43.498 --> 39:45.721
Sweetie, this is not the time.

39:45.721 --> 39:47.822
Let's just celebrate.

39:47.856 --> 39:49.558
Wait wait wait a second. Are you...

39:49.592 --> 39:50.768
are you telling me they're
seriously thinking

39:50.768 --> 39:52.828
about cutting the program after this?

39:53.431 --> 39:55.798
This was an amazing accomplishment,

39:55.832 --> 39:59.668
but it didn't magically
create the money that we need

39:59.703 --> 40:02.371
to keep this program alive.

40:03.348 --> 40:04.908
I'm sorry.

40:12.587 --> 40:15.484
Okay, first of all, Olivia has

40:15.518 --> 40:19.488
like nine lbs of weed
in your dad's garage.

40:20.262 --> 40:22.791
- Weed?
- Yes, weed!

40:22.826 --> 40:27.396
Pot, marijuana. She is selling
drugs out of your dad's garage.

40:28.665 --> 40:30.466
You think that I'd make that up?

40:32.422 --> 40:36.175
I kept picturing rival drug dealers...

40:36.175 --> 40:38.574
masked men with shotguns

40:38.608 --> 40:40.876
breaking into your house
in the dead of night

40:40.911 --> 40:42.846
looking for her stash.

40:42.880 --> 40:46.883
Emmett, I did it because I care about you.

40:49.362 --> 40:52.136
I know. I'm sorry but...

40:52.137 --> 40:53.634
I don't think that it's a safe.

40:58.830 --> 41:00.664
Emmett, I...

41:03.943 --> 41:06.370
Damn it.

42:01.885 --> 42:02.416
Hey.

42:03.808 --> 42:05.476
You need a hand?

42:05.510 --> 42:07.778
What happened? Did you hurt yourself?

42:10.347 --> 42:11.614
I know the feeling.

42:11.648 --> 42:14.551
I wanted to punch a wall myself today.

42:15.283 --> 42:17.117
Did you see the game?

42:18.751 --> 42:19.623
Yeah.

42:21.004 --> 42:22.736
I have a bottle of vodka in my room.

42:22.736 --> 42:25.571
I was planning on having a few
shots and watching pay-per-view.

42:35.481 --> 42:38.383
Yeah, you should probably go wrap that.

42:41.096 --> 42:42.497
I could help.

42:55.212 --> 42:57.247
Got one for you, or Emmett.

42:58.185 --> 43:01.762
Now this will fit either
a 110/90 or 120/90 tire.

43:01.762 --> 43:03.527
Thank you, uh,

43:03.651 --> 43:05.485
but you can keep it.

43:07.388 --> 43:09.589
I really don't think Emmett's

43:09.623 --> 43:12.491
ever gonna talk to me again.

43:14.707 --> 43:17.575
Well, I'm sure whatever you did,

43:17.659 --> 43:19.760
he'll get over it.

43:19.987 --> 43:21.988
You guys are perfect together.
