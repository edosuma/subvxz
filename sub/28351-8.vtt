00:01.233 --> 00:01.433
.

00:10.233 --> 00:11.767
'The Geordies are back.'

00:11.833 --> 00:13.367
Hello!

00:13.433 --> 00:15.033
'Doing the things we love.'

00:15.900 --> 00:20.267
'But this time,
man's gonna mix things right
up.'

00:24.500 --> 00:26.900
(knock on door)
There are four newbies!

00:26.967 --> 00:30.233
Oh, my God!
It's gonna be fucking mint.

00:31.900 --> 00:35.000
Anna's given the Geordie squad
a naughty facelift.

00:35.067 --> 00:36.800
I love a bit of change, me.

00:38.033 --> 00:40.167
But some things never change.

00:43.533 --> 00:45.467
I love this family.

00:46.333 --> 00:48.867
(bell rings)
Ding-fucking-ding, you dicks.

00:48.933 --> 00:50.200
(all cheer)

00:50.267 --> 00:52.267
Take it all in, bitch.
Take it all in.

00:53.100 --> 00:56.000
It's been nice to spend
a bit of one-on-one time again.

00:56.067 --> 00:58.400
Me and Sam are closer than ever.

00:58.467 --> 01:00.100
I feel like I'm losing my head.

01:00.167 --> 01:03.367
He's saying one thing, doing
another
and not talking to us.

01:03.433 --> 01:06.300
I can't believe me and Beau
haven't sorted it out.

01:06.367 --> 01:09.867
I need to learn how to open up
more
to people that I care about.

01:09.933 --> 01:13.700
Nathan's helped me realise I
need
to tell Bethan how I feel about
her.

01:13.767 --> 01:17.067
My head's banging.
I don't think I'm gonna be going
out.

01:17.133 --> 01:18.667
(all) Cheers!

01:22.700 --> 01:24.967
This is the most honest
he's ever been.

01:27.233 --> 01:28.633
Great!

01:29.500 --> 01:32.667
Being single, having fun,
that sounds like a bit of me.

01:34.600 --> 01:37.533
The three of us could be a
tripod.

01:40.300 --> 01:42.167
'I'm preened to perfection.'

01:42.233 --> 01:44.300
'I'm totally crackers, me,
like.'

01:44.367 --> 01:47.333
'A lad who's got more cheek
than a girl with fillers.'

01:47.400 --> 01:50.800
'Sometimes bubbly, sometimes
bitchy,
I'm all over the place.'

01:50.867 --> 01:53.600
'I'm that good-looking
I'd neck on with myself.'

01:53.667 --> 01:56.400
'I can talk the back legs
off a donkey.'

01:56.467 --> 01:59.267
'I might dance like a grandad,
but I'm proper radge.'

01:59.333 --> 02:01.900
'I'm fit, I'm flirty
and I've got double Fs.'

02:01.967 --> 02:05.233
'I don't go on the pull.
The girls just love the guns.'

02:05.300 --> 02:08.667
'I might look rough and ready,
but I am a massive softie.'

02:08.733 --> 02:11.867
'I can't believe anyone would
put me
in charge of this lot.'

02:11.933 --> 02:13.800
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

02:32.333 --> 02:34.133
Chloe, your arm.

02:36.067 --> 02:38.667
Well, I've woke up fresh.

02:38.733 --> 02:42.300
I feel so much better, I can't
wait
to get back out with the family,

02:42.367 --> 02:46.100
but there's one thing for sure,
I'm staying away from Nat's
cooking.

02:47.367 --> 02:48.567
How was last night?

02:48.633 --> 02:50.700
A really good night,
but I did miss you.

02:50.767 --> 02:53.000
I am buzzing
that Sam is feeling better,

02:53.067 --> 02:56.300
but right now I need to know
exactly
what Bethan got up to.

02:58.800 --> 03:00.400
Get out, Beau! Go on.
No, man.

03:00.467 --> 03:04.167
I'm sick of Beau being in my
bed.
There's spunk all over. Get out!

03:04.233 --> 03:06.400
You had sex with him?
You know what it is,

03:06.467 --> 03:08.100
last night was the first night

03:08.167 --> 03:10.733
where I just felt like
I had my head back.

03:10.800 --> 03:13.300
You and Beau spoke.
That's all you ever wanted

03:13.367 --> 03:15.067
was for Beau to speak to you.

03:15.133 --> 03:18.500
What did he say to you?
He proper opened up, you know.

03:18.567 --> 03:22.400
All I ever wanted was for Beau
to be honest about his feelings,

03:22.467 --> 03:25.767
so for him to open up last night
really means the world.

03:25.833 --> 03:29.333
We agreed we are just gonna
get with each other,

03:29.400 --> 03:32.033
we're not gonna get
with anyone else like, so...

03:32.100 --> 03:34.833
Do youse not feel
that's a little relationship-y,

03:34.900 --> 03:36.233
or are youse fine?

03:36.300 --> 03:38.500
It's just two people
getting together,

03:38.567 --> 03:41.233
not putting a label on it.
Do you know what I mean?

03:41.300 --> 03:44.033
Two people getting together,
living in the house,

03:44.100 --> 03:46.500
living in the same bed,
not going on the pull,

03:46.567 --> 03:48.400
basically, it's a relationship.

03:48.467 --> 03:51.967
I guess Chloe's right, we're
doing
everything a couple would do.

03:52.033 --> 03:53.333
Just don't tell Beau.

03:53.400 --> 03:56.700
Tahlia, I wanna know
what the fuck happened last
night.

03:56.767 --> 04:00.100
I feel like Nathan was overly
horny
last night, cos he was like,

04:00.167 --> 04:02.133
"Let's all neck on, three-way
kiss."

04:02.200 --> 04:05.400
Where was Natalie?
I think she took herself to bed.

04:05.467 --> 04:08.400
Really?
Yeah. Got her salad out the
fridge.

04:08.467 --> 04:09.567
A salad?!

04:09.633 --> 04:14.267
Howay, who gets back after a
night
out on a peeve and has a salad?

04:14.333 --> 04:15.833
Who does that?

04:18.300 --> 04:22.100
Make us a cup of tea, three
sugars,
milk, leave the teabag in,

04:22.167 --> 04:23.767
that's how I like it, bitch!

04:26.900 --> 04:30.933
Where did you sleep?
In Tahlia's double bed.

04:31.000 --> 04:32.800
What?!
With Beth, though.

04:32.867 --> 04:37.167
From the look on Beau's face,
it's
clear him and Bethan were
shagging,

04:37.233 --> 04:39.633
cos that boy is grinning
like a Cheshire cat.

04:39.700 --> 04:41.967
Did youse make up last night?
Aye.

04:42.033 --> 04:45.033
I had a lot to say to her.
Puppy dog eyes. I was honest,
aye.

04:45.100 --> 04:48.233
Opening up to Bethan how I feel
went better than I thought,

04:48.300 --> 04:51.500
and even my crutches didn't stop
me
from getting my leg over.

04:51.567 --> 04:54.800
What was going on in the hot
tub?
What happened in the hot tub

04:54.867 --> 04:55.933
stays in the hot tub.

04:56.000 --> 04:59.633
Tripod consists of the three
single
people in the house,

04:59.700 --> 05:02.500
which is me, Alex and Tahlia.

05:02.567 --> 05:06.233
Nathan's six foot four,
Tahlia is five foot fuck all

05:06.300 --> 05:10.233
and Alex is as big as he is
wide.
What a wonky tripod.

05:10.300 --> 05:14.167
Alex, you're young, you're free,
you're single, who gives a fuck?

05:14.233 --> 05:18.067
Not saying anything. I could do
with forgetting last night's
antics.

05:19.067 --> 05:22.067
Listen, last night
was a great night, so to
celebrate,

05:22.133 --> 05:24.600
why doesn't mama go
and put on a fry-up?

05:24.667 --> 05:26.400
'Last night was a class night
out

05:26.467 --> 05:29.800
and I reckon we can all do with
some scran this morning.'

05:29.867 --> 05:32.533
I just hope
I don't give anyone else the
shits.

05:34.000 --> 05:37.200
Chloe, fancy coming down
and doing these poached eggs?

05:40.100 --> 05:42.333
Fucking hell, you nearly hit me!

05:42.400 --> 05:45.233
Clear this table!
You're not very flexible, are
you?

05:45.300 --> 05:46.400
I've got a bad back.

05:47.300 --> 05:48.433
Oh!

05:53.333 --> 05:56.533
That's how you pick dog poo up.
Practically the same thing.

05:57.400 --> 05:59.267
(all) Bring the food!

05:59.333 --> 06:02.067
(Scotty T) Oggy, oggy, oggy.

06:02.133 --> 06:05.433
Oh, look, Scott just bounced in,
this should be interesting.

06:05.500 --> 06:08.967
Did youse have a good night?
Sit down and join us for
breakfast.

06:09.033 --> 06:12.400
It's breakfast with Big Dick
and I need everyone's attention.

06:12.467 --> 06:16.167
Today, you need to pack up
all you shit, dive on the bus,

06:16.233 --> 06:21.467
cos you're going to fucking
Cardiff.
Where's Cardiff? Where is it?

06:21.533 --> 06:23.800
Is it a different country?
Wales.

06:23.867 --> 06:25.900
I am buzzing to get to Cardiff.

06:25.967 --> 06:28.433
'It's my second home,
this lot will love it.'

06:28.500 --> 06:29.567
Get in, man.

06:29.633 --> 06:32.533
My brother lives down there.
(Nathan) 'Another Beau!'

06:32.600 --> 06:35.800
Oh, God, be still my beating
vagina.

06:35.867 --> 06:37.933
You have Beau,
I'll have his brother.

06:38.000 --> 06:40.900
Is he fit?
He's actually your type.

06:41.000 --> 06:44.533
I know Beau's brother, I met the
kid
in Maga and I love him to bits,

06:44.600 --> 06:46.500
and Tahlia is gonna fancy him.

06:47.767 --> 06:49.933
I'm off.
See you later, girls and Beau.

06:50.000 --> 06:53.533
Bye.
Take care, enjoy.

06:53.600 --> 06:56.667
It's time for these lot to pack
their shit and get ready,

06:56.733 --> 07:00.933
while I jet-wash my whole body,
cos this house is fucking
minging.

07:02.500 --> 07:06.300
Oh, my God, I'm so excited.
Everyone dress really nice.

07:06.367 --> 07:08.033
I want us to look really cool.

07:08.100 --> 07:11.633
(all) Cardiff, Cardiff,
Cardiff, Cardiff!

07:11.700 --> 07:15.400
I am so excited to get to Wales.
I want to work on my Welsh
accent.

07:15.467 --> 07:18.467
(in bad Welsh accent)
Get me on that bus to Cardiff!

07:28.433 --> 07:30.333
(horn blasts)

07:30.400 --> 07:35.100
Come on, then,
we're going to Cardiff!

07:36.933 --> 07:39.567
Watch out.
No! No!

07:58.133 --> 07:59.800
I'm very excited for Cardiff.

07:59.867 --> 08:02.033
What's there, Beau?
It's good, like.

08:02.100 --> 08:05.500
The Welsh are very similar
to the Geordies,

08:05.567 --> 08:07.567
sound as fuck and up for the
sesh.

08:07.633 --> 08:10.967
Got a long way to travel, but
these lot are gonna love
Cardiff.

08:11.933 --> 08:15.933
Can anyone do a Welsh accent?
(in Welsh accent) I'm going to
Wales.

08:16.000 --> 08:19.467
(in Welsh accent) We're going to
Wales, I'm going to see my
daddy.

08:19.533 --> 08:22.433
I'm gonna suck his dick
and it's gonna be amazing.

08:24.167 --> 08:28.300
This journey is gonna be a pure
mission. We need entertainment.

08:28.367 --> 08:30.767
Right, youse,
I think we should play a game.

08:30.833 --> 08:33.767
Every person ask a question
and you've got to answer.

08:33.832 --> 08:35.400
Let's play it with a twist.

08:35.467 --> 08:38.067
You're not allowed to answer
with the answer.

08:38.133 --> 08:40.500
Nathan, what colour is the sky?
Orange.

08:40.567 --> 08:42.767
Chloe, how big is your mouth.
Small.

08:42.832 --> 08:45.700
Alex, do you wanna have sex with
me?
No.

08:45.767 --> 08:47.900
(all yell and cheer)

08:49.533 --> 08:53.167
(all) Cardiff, Cardiff, Cardiff,
Cardiff, Cardiff!

08:55.633 --> 08:59.100
Last time we went away on this
bus,
Chloe and Sam hit rock bottom.

08:59.167 --> 09:03.000
They seem much better, but I
just
need to make sure that Chloe's
OK.

09:03.067 --> 09:05.967
How do you feel about Sam?
I think we're in a good place.

09:06.033 --> 09:08.533
Honest to God,
you just seem so much happier.

09:08.600 --> 09:12.100
He is doing little things,
but I think it's the little
things.

09:12.167 --> 09:16.033
Since Belfast, Sam has really
tried hard to show that he cares

09:16.100 --> 09:19.400
and I don't think he realises
how much that means to us.

09:19.467 --> 09:23.233
Obviously he hasn't been very
well
and the whole house has missed
him.

09:23.300 --> 09:26.067
It's good to have Sam back with
us.

09:26.133 --> 09:29.133
Him being better and with us lot
makes Chloe so happy.

09:29.200 --> 09:31.600
Cardiff is gonna be mint.

09:42.033 --> 09:44.700
Oh, my God, it's so pretty!

09:46.033 --> 09:48.067
Don't know about you,
I'm getting off.

09:48.133 --> 09:50.367
I am so fucking excited!

09:50.433 --> 09:53.300
I'm from the Gold Coast,
so I've never seen snow.

09:53.367 --> 09:54.867
This is already amazing.

09:54.933 --> 09:56.967
Oh, my God, it's so amazing!

09:58.633 --> 10:00.667
Alex has never seen snow before,

10:00.733 --> 10:04.567
so I need to introduce him into
this thing called a snowball
fight.

10:07.567 --> 10:11.000
Why do people think this is fun?
I can't feel my fingers.

10:12.400 --> 10:14.433
Ow! I'm telling you,
no sex for a week.

10:14.500 --> 10:18.400
They think they're having fun,
wait till they get to the club.

10:18.467 --> 10:19.967
I know just the place to go.

10:23.933 --> 10:26.967
(Nathan) Youse, I nearly died!
Fucking leave me, aye.

10:28.167 --> 10:30.833
First come, first served.

10:30.900 --> 10:34.767
I can't believe this place. I
thought
we were gonna be getting changed

10:34.833 --> 10:37.800
in public toilets,
just like in Belfast.

10:37.867 --> 10:39.800
Fucking hell, unbelievable!

10:43.567 --> 10:48.067
I am never gonna bad-mouth
Anna again, this place is
amazing.

10:49.633 --> 10:51.500
We're gonna have to share a bed.

10:52.900 --> 10:55.600
Bethan's with Beau,
Chloe's sharing with Sam

10:55.667 --> 10:57.167
and Natalie has Tahlia,

10:57.233 --> 11:01.300
so I'm left with Alex,
and I ain't complaining.

11:01.367 --> 11:03.733
Anna has literally done amazing.

11:03.800 --> 11:06.433
Anna must be pure wedged
to afford these cabins.

11:06.500 --> 11:08.800
I literally feel like
I'm on my honeymoon!

11:08.867 --> 11:10.967
Whoo!

11:13.800 --> 11:16.000
We're necking on.
This a relationship?

11:17.100 --> 11:18.467
It's in my eye!

11:18.533 --> 11:20.500
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

11:24.000 --> 11:24.167
.

11:26.700 --> 11:26.900
.

11:37.433 --> 11:38.733
This shit's tight!

11:38.800 --> 11:40.833
After last night's three-way
kiss,

11:40.900 --> 11:43.000
I'm gonna have fun
and wind the boys up.

11:43.067 --> 11:45.367
You not making room for Tahlia?

11:45.433 --> 11:49.100
There's only double beds in
here.
You've got plenty of room in
there.

11:49.167 --> 11:51.600
So you want all three of us
to couple up in a bed?

11:51.667 --> 11:55.233
What you have been talking about
is different to what you are
doing.

11:55.300 --> 11:57.667
Everyone's telling us single lot
what to do.

11:57.733 --> 11:59.033
They're all jealous,

11:59.100 --> 12:02.467
cos we can do what we want
without consequences.

12:02.533 --> 12:04.400
The house is taking this
serious.

12:04.467 --> 12:07.200
You think me, him and Tahlia
are gonna fuck?

12:07.267 --> 12:09.033
I did overhear the conversation

12:09.100 --> 12:12.167
and it might've been a joke,
but it was forward, let's say.

12:12.233 --> 12:14.833
I mean, it was a joke,
but I would do it.

12:15.867 --> 12:19.733
I'm laughing this off in front
of
the guys, but inside I'm
shaking.

12:19.800 --> 12:22.267
Nathan would ruin me.

12:23.700 --> 12:26.400
Are you on the pull tonight?
I'm not wasting time.

12:26.467 --> 12:31.233
Yes, lad.
Yes! I'm free!

12:31.300 --> 12:33.767
Wait, wait, wait.
I said I'm going on the pull,

12:33.833 --> 12:36.267
I didn't say
I might be bringing someone
back,

12:36.333 --> 12:38.500
we're sharing a room,
you're not free.

12:40.133 --> 12:42.467
If I pull tonight,
Alex has got two options.

12:42.533 --> 12:44.367
He can watch or he can join in.

12:44.433 --> 12:48.333
I'll neck on with someone
in the club and come back to
Daddy.

12:50.767 --> 12:52.967
Right, obviously I had surfing
at 9.00,

12:53.033 --> 12:55.233
but I had the fucking club at
10.00.

12:55.300 --> 12:57.600
Oh, sexy mama.

12:57.667 --> 13:00.167
Nice having you in the room.
Thanks, guys.

13:00.233 --> 13:03.033
I understand why Natalie
gets ready with the lads,

13:03.100 --> 13:05.600
cos us lasses
take a pure mission contouring,

13:05.667 --> 13:08.900
but we've all got vaginas,
so we can all get ready
together.

13:08.967 --> 13:12.700
I think I've been here about
half an hour and I'm ready,
so...

13:12.767 --> 13:16.167
It's really easy for you to just
get ready, you just put a hat
on.

13:18.400 --> 13:21.167
Oh, you fucker.
(Alex) Oh, nice and fresh.

13:21.233 --> 13:22.533
(yelps)

13:22.600 --> 13:25.833
Fuck me, this is cold.
It is beautiful.

13:25.900 --> 13:28.967
Shall we get the girls out?
Yeah, one, two, three...

13:29.033 --> 13:30.833
(all) Girls!

13:30.900 --> 13:32.200
(Bethan) Coming.

13:32.267 --> 13:35.467
It is tradition to have a drink
before you go out.

13:35.533 --> 13:37.800
It might be freezing,
it might be snowing,

13:37.867 --> 13:42.067
but this vodka, lime and
lemonade
is going down like a hot
chocolate.

13:43.433 --> 13:45.533
We're in Cardiff,
we're in a good place,

13:45.600 --> 13:48.267
let's have a wicked night.
No kick-offs. Cheers.

13:48.333 --> 13:49.433
(all) Cheers!

13:49.500 --> 13:52.267
Tonight is like
a proper Geordie night out.

13:52.333 --> 13:55.767
It's absolutely freezing and
the girls have got next to nowt
on.

13:55.833 --> 13:57.400
Bring on tonight.

13:57.467 --> 13:58.967
I miss Australian weather.

14:01.367 --> 14:05.733
Everyone's on top form and in
for a
treat with the club we're going
to.

14:05.800 --> 14:08.433
(all) Cardiff, Cardiff,
Cardiff, Cardiff!

14:14.300 --> 14:18.000
We've arrived at the club.
There's girls dancing on bars,

14:18.067 --> 14:21.700
there's men drinking beer,
and there's even a rodeo bull.

14:21.767 --> 14:23.267
What more could you want?

14:43.467 --> 14:46.900
I can see those dancers on the
bar
and I'm just thinking to myself,

14:46.967 --> 14:51.300
"This is the best opportunity
to pull out some shapes for
Beau."

15:01.967 --> 15:04.733
There's two types of girls
in the world.

15:04.800 --> 15:08.667
Ones that dance like Bethan,
Chloe
and Tahlia, and that dance like
Nat.

15:12.500 --> 15:15.400
You never get to dance
on a bar in Newcastle

15:15.467 --> 15:18.700
and this has been mint, I just
hope
that Beau appreciated it.

15:48.800 --> 15:51.300
I don't know what Sam's on
about.

15:51.367 --> 15:54.633
They are practically married.
They're gonna be having kids!

15:59.867 --> 16:01.100
They aren't together,

16:01.167 --> 16:04.633
he wouldn't be doing anything
wrong
if he necked on with somebody.

16:16.433 --> 16:20.667
These two need to calm down.
Bethan
and Beau have only really just
met.

16:20.733 --> 16:23.833
Everyone needs to chill out
and let them have fun.

16:29.500 --> 16:32.800
Alex won't stop groping us.
Does he know there's three of
us?

16:32.867 --> 16:35.400
You need to give Tahlia
equal attention.

16:35.467 --> 16:40.433
Tripod!
Tripod, tripod, tripod.

16:44.133 --> 16:45.667
Here we go again.

16:49.700 --> 16:51.133
Ah!

16:52.667 --> 16:55.733
Me, Tahlia and Alex
can't resist each other.

16:55.800 --> 16:59.367
We're necking on again and we're
not
as drunk as we were last night.

16:59.433 --> 17:00.700
Is this a relationship?

17:22.267 --> 17:24.000
Chloe's got such a good heart,

17:24.067 --> 17:27.267
and it's cos of her I was able
to sort things out with Bethan.

17:36.167 --> 17:39.267
When couples fight in the house,
it brings everyone down,

17:39.333 --> 17:41.500
so I'm so glad
that these two are happy,

17:41.567 --> 17:45.000
but I still need to know
where Beau's head is actually
at.

17:56.467 --> 17:58.433
Beau doesn't want a
relationship?

17:58.500 --> 18:01.233
Why's he going with Bethan
if he doesn't want one?

18:08.167 --> 18:09.267
Whoa!

18:26.633 --> 18:30.900
We're acting like cowboys, but
none
of us have had a go on the bull
yet.

18:34.467 --> 18:36.667
(Bethan)
'There's a bull in the club.'

18:36.733 --> 18:38.733
Geez a go, I wanna warm up for
Beau.

18:40.567 --> 18:43.733
Bethan, move over,
let me show you how a pro does
it.

18:53.167 --> 18:56.867
I ride dicks, not bulls,
so I won't be going on this.

18:57.967 --> 19:00.600
Go on, Chloe!

19:02.667 --> 19:05.267
These lot are pathetic.
Let me have a go.

19:05.333 --> 19:07.000
Might be the only ride I get.

19:15.267 --> 19:16.300
Oh, my God!

19:16.367 --> 19:18.867
Shit, Sam's just broke
the fucking bull!

19:20.133 --> 19:21.467
What the fuck?!

19:21.533 --> 19:24.433
Sam is literally
the skinniest person in the
club,

19:24.500 --> 19:27.533
how the fuck
has he managed to break the
bull?!

19:27.600 --> 19:29.167
Whoo!

19:29.233 --> 19:32.100
Tonight has been mint,
but we need to leave

19:32.167 --> 19:34.700
before we get the bill
for that rodeo bull.

19:40.500 --> 19:42.333
Where's the kebab?
Kebab here.

19:46.133 --> 19:50.000
Please can I get chips,
no cheese and gravy, please?

19:50.067 --> 19:52.433
Pay the man.
I'll pay you with a ring.

19:52.500 --> 19:55.600
When Nathan says he's gonna pay
with a ring, say no,

19:55.667 --> 19:57.133
cos it's his bumhole.

19:57.200 --> 20:02.133
Everyone has had a mint night,
but
I wanna spice things up a
little.

20:03.167 --> 20:05.200
(indistinct)

20:05.267 --> 20:08.967
You haven't got the balls.
You would never do that.

20:09.033 --> 20:10.700
What? Don't test us.

20:10.767 --> 20:13.067
Bethan's got that look.
Could be trouble.

20:13.133 --> 20:15.533
Don't test us, bitch. Don't
test...

20:17.833 --> 20:20.633
Shit! I did not mean to do that.

20:20.700 --> 20:23.367
Oh, well, in for a penny,
in for a pound.

20:23.433 --> 20:25.167
(Chloe) No... Oh!

20:27.967 --> 20:30.000
What about you?
No, no!

20:30.067 --> 20:31.100
Ow!

20:31.167 --> 20:32.833
'I'm lactose intolerant.'

20:32.900 --> 20:36.267
I can't have garlic sauce
running up and down my body.

20:36.333 --> 20:37.867
It's not good for my skin.

20:42.167 --> 20:44.233
It's in my eye!

20:44.300 --> 20:46.333
That's a look I could get used
to!

20:49.067 --> 20:52.100
I'm not letting these radge
packets
ruin my scran.

20:52.167 --> 20:53.267
I want my kebab,

20:53.333 --> 20:56.200
but I guess I'll have to have it
with extra sauce now.

20:56.267 --> 20:58.100
Get off me, bitch! Get off me!

20:58.167 --> 21:03.200
You know it's a good night
when you're covered in hot
sauce.

21:09.000 --> 21:10.867
Oh, my God!

21:13.833 --> 21:16.100
That's for getting me
with garlic sauce!

21:16.167 --> 21:18.467
Fair play, Nathan, I deserved
that.

21:18.533 --> 21:21.600
I'm not getting you,
I'm getting Bethan.

21:21.667 --> 21:23.667
I'm happy everyone had a good
night,

21:23.733 --> 21:27.367
gutted they didn't get to meet
my
brother, they would have loved
him.

21:35.300 --> 21:37.633
Goodnight. Love you.

21:37.700 --> 21:39.533
It's been a good, but very long
day.

21:39.600 --> 21:43.400
I'm gonna get my head down
so we can do it all again
tomorrow.

21:43.467 --> 21:45.500
Goodnight, baby.
I'm so drunk.

21:45.567 --> 21:47.333
Are you?

21:47.400 --> 21:50.700
Last time me and Sam went away,
we ended up in separate beds,

21:50.767 --> 21:53.333
but it's good that me and him
can be happy again.

21:57.733 --> 22:02.300
Lying here with Beau almost
makes us
forget that anyone else is here,

22:02.367 --> 22:03.867
and I couldn't be happier.

22:03.933 --> 22:06.467
(moans)

22:06.533 --> 22:08.700
We've had
such a good evening, darling.

22:08.767 --> 22:13.833
Let's have a toast to us
and 20 more years of good
marriage.

22:13.900 --> 22:17.467
I'm not gonna lie, I have loved
every minute of tonight.

22:17.533 --> 22:20.400
I'm finally able
to enjoy single life.

22:20.467 --> 22:23.167
You look like Peter Andre
with your hair like that.

22:23.233 --> 22:25.200
Who's Peter Andre?
You what?

22:25.267 --> 22:26.333
Who's that?

22:26.400 --> 22:29.767
How can you not know who Peter
Andre
is?! He's from Australia.

22:29.833 --> 22:33.233
I don't know who that is.
Goodnight, then.

22:35.367 --> 22:36.700
There it is there.

22:36.767 --> 22:38.900
I feel I'm in
a bit of a relationship.

22:38.967 --> 22:41.000
I just wanna take it slow.
Shit!

22:41.067 --> 22:43.467
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

22:46.433 --> 22:46.633
.

22:49.200 --> 22:49.400
.

23:04.433 --> 23:07.033
Good morning!
Stop that right now.

23:07.100 --> 23:12.067
Sam, please shut the fuck up.
Your voice is shrill.

23:12.133 --> 23:15.700
Youse two look cosy in bed
together.
It's our marital bed.

23:15.767 --> 23:18.267
Look how happy they look.
They suit each other

23:18.333 --> 23:19.900
and would make a good couple.

23:19.967 --> 23:22.000
If only Alex was gay!

23:22.067 --> 23:23.933
I can't wait for tonight now.

23:24.000 --> 23:25.700
Morning.
Hello.

23:25.767 --> 23:29.400
How is everyone?
Move over, please.

23:29.467 --> 23:32.200
Did you get your leg over, Beau?
Aye, course I did.

23:32.267 --> 23:34.633
I think Sam is forgetting
what sex is like.

23:34.700 --> 23:36.833
He's always asking what I got up
to.

23:38.267 --> 23:40.967
Once you've been with Bethan
for a year and a half,

23:41.033 --> 23:43.367
you won't be shagging
after a night out.

23:43.433 --> 23:47.200
That's the point of a
relationship,
sex. I'm just taking it steady.

23:47.267 --> 23:49.533
I wouldn't say
youse are taking it steady.

23:49.600 --> 23:51.867
If Bethan and Beau
were a rollercoaster,

23:51.933 --> 23:55.133
they're the point when you take
off,
hair is in your face

23:55.200 --> 23:57.667
and you can't see
and it's going too fast.

23:57.733 --> 24:00.433
That ain't slow, mate,
that's petrifying.

24:00.500 --> 24:03.700
I wouldn't say it's serious,
I'm not thinking about that.

24:03.767 --> 24:06.600
It looks intense.
Yeah, that's fair enough.

24:06.667 --> 24:09.200
The lads have to realise
I've just met the girl.

24:09.267 --> 24:11.333
I do like her,
but I wanna take it slow.

24:11.400 --> 24:14.467
Boys, look out the window.
Not the image you'd have

24:14.533 --> 24:17.600
when you think about Wales, is
it?
That is gorgeous.

24:17.667 --> 24:19.233
That looks like...
Canada.

24:19.300 --> 24:23.167
Is that what Canada looks like?
I don't know, I've never been.

24:24.100 --> 24:25.167
How was your night?

24:25.233 --> 24:28.667
I'm not gonna lie, I do feel
like
I'm in a bit of a relationship.

24:28.733 --> 24:30.900
You look like
you're in a relationship.

24:30.967 --> 24:32.367
Youse act like youse are.

24:32.433 --> 24:36.433
I can literally feel myself
falling
so hard for Beau,

24:36.500 --> 24:38.733
sooner or later
I'm going to want more.

24:38.800 --> 24:41.400
He does like you,
but he did say he has told you

24:41.467 --> 24:43.567
he just wants to take things
slow.

24:43.633 --> 24:47.367
As far as I'm concerned,
it's a bit too late to take it
slow.

24:47.433 --> 24:49.900
The sex last night was great.
How long?

24:49.967 --> 24:54.200
Wasn't too long, perfect amount
of
time. I don't like going for
ages.

24:54.267 --> 24:56.467
It's pointless.
Have a throbbing fanny.

24:56.533 --> 24:58.967
That's grim.
I want my vagina to be
throbbing.

24:59.033 --> 25:01.633
I miss... I'm like...

25:01.700 --> 25:05.267
The only thing throbbing today
is my head, cos I'm hungover!

25:07.400 --> 25:10.200
(whirring)

25:10.267 --> 25:13.500
What's that?
Eh? What you talking about?

25:15.867 --> 25:19.567
Did I pack a vibrator in my bag?
Cos what the hell is that noise?

25:19.633 --> 25:22.400
What's that noise?
(whirring continues)

25:22.467 --> 25:25.533
(Bethan) Oh, my God.
Who the fuck is that?!

25:25.600 --> 25:28.100
Who the fuck is flying
this early in the morning

25:28.167 --> 25:31.133
in a bastard helicopter?
They not know we're hungover?

25:31.200 --> 25:33.567
It's fucking someone.
Let's go find out.

25:33.633 --> 25:36.333
'Please, please, please,

25:36.400 --> 25:40.100
let it be a hot single lad
with a big chopper.'

25:40.167 --> 25:41.400
Come on, then!

25:42.667 --> 25:45.133
Oh, it's cold.

25:45.200 --> 25:46.500
(Bethan) There he is!

25:47.533 --> 25:52.067
Oh, my God, the helicopter.
Is it a bird, is it a plane?

25:53.633 --> 25:56.000
No, it's Scotty T.

25:56.067 --> 25:58.800
Come to check up on everyone,
but there was no way

25:58.867 --> 26:00.500
I was getting stuck in snow,

26:00.567 --> 26:03.733
so it's a good thing I've got
my other chopper on standby.

26:03.800 --> 26:06.933
The difference between this one
and the one between my legs

26:07.000 --> 26:09.900
is this one runs on petrol,
not fucking rocket fuel.

26:09.967 --> 26:13.000
You could have drove.
How was the bus though, anyway?

26:13.067 --> 26:15.333
Long.
Nothing compared to that.

26:15.400 --> 26:18.367
That was amazing.
Only took us half an hour.

26:18.433 --> 26:22.567
If Scotty T wants to travel
round in
a helicopter, he'll do as he
pleases,

26:22.633 --> 26:25.800
and if they still wanna whinge,
next time I'll park up in a jet

26:25.867 --> 26:28.867
and drive a fucking Lambo
straight out the back.

26:28.933 --> 26:34.267
You've got some work this
afternoon,
so I need you to be fucking
ready.

26:34.333 --> 26:39.033
Why has Scott come all the way
from Newcastle in a helicopter?

26:39.100 --> 26:41.267
Has he heard of a mobile phone?

26:41.333 --> 26:45.033
After that, make sure you pack
your
stuff, cos you're going back.

26:45.100 --> 26:46.167
(all) What?

26:46.233 --> 26:49.133
Are we not going out?
Are we not going out tonight?

26:49.200 --> 26:50.833
Shit to do back in Newcastle.

26:50.900 --> 26:53.567
Aye.
We're going home, tonight?

26:53.633 --> 26:57.300
Gutted we're not staying.
I really wanted to see my
brother.

26:58.367 --> 27:01.500
I can't believe we have gone
on a bus for about ten hours

27:01.567 --> 27:05.300
to come to Cardiff
for one fucking night!

27:05.367 --> 27:06.467
Yeah!

27:06.533 --> 27:09.000
Last one back to the cabin's
a rotten egg.

27:09.067 --> 27:11.967
We've got work, then we've gotta
get back to Newcastle.

27:12.033 --> 27:13.867
Let's bounce, mate.

27:13.933 --> 27:15.767
Today has just got shit.

27:22.033 --> 27:23.900
Yeah!

27:23.967 --> 27:25.667
Gotta get ready.

27:25.733 --> 27:28.233
I cannot believe
that we've gotta go to work

27:28.300 --> 27:31.067
while Scott gets to swan about
in a fucking chopper!

27:31.133 --> 27:34.033
Come on, shaggers, stop having
sex.

27:35.133 --> 27:36.300
Ah, my foot.

27:36.367 --> 27:39.167
Go on, lovers,
youse get in the back.

27:40.133 --> 27:43.300
I'm more gutted he's fucking
said
we're going home today.

27:43.367 --> 27:46.133
I was looking forward
to meeting Beau's brother.

27:52.000 --> 27:55.033
We've arrived, and it doesn't
take
a genius to realise

27:55.100 --> 27:58.167
that Anna wants us
to test out the facilities.

27:58.233 --> 28:01.100
But I'm far too hungover
for this shit.

28:03.333 --> 28:05.233
They fucking stink of fish!

28:05.300 --> 28:09.667
'Is Anna pure radge? She knows
for a fine fact I cannot swim.'

28:09.733 --> 28:12.700
I just think she likes
getting me pure wet. Dirty cow.

28:16.333 --> 28:17.600
Ooh!

28:27.667 --> 28:30.500
Water sports?
Now this is more my style.

28:37.033 --> 28:40.000
Whoa! This is not my forte.

28:40.067 --> 28:42.100
Rather be up here cold
than there wet.

28:44.367 --> 28:47.867
For fuck's sake,
now I'm up here, cold and wet.

28:47.933 --> 28:49.967
Cheers, you bunch of dicks.

28:53.567 --> 28:57.067
I am actually gutted that I
can't
take part in these activities,

28:57.133 --> 28:58.400
cos they look a belter.

28:58.467 --> 29:00.367
Hello, chicken nugget!

29:04.900 --> 29:07.400
Shit! Shit!

29:07.467 --> 29:10.800
Alex has fell out, and he's
halfway down the fucking thing.

29:12.633 --> 29:14.833
Did you see Alex fall out?
Yeah, I know.

29:14.900 --> 29:16.967
That looks scary as fuck, that.

29:18.033 --> 29:20.467
What the fuck?!
This water's freezing.

29:23.333 --> 29:25.133
I am gutted that work is
finished,

29:25.200 --> 29:28.900
because now we have to get back
on that fucking bus.

29:30.633 --> 29:33.133
You know what,
it was good, but it was
freezing.

29:33.200 --> 29:36.633
I feel Anna will definitely do
that.
I got the proper experience.

29:36.700 --> 29:39.933
What's amazing, that is work,
and we get to test it out.

29:40.000 --> 29:43.133
I'm gutted for Beau,
cos obviously being in Cardiff,

29:43.200 --> 29:45.067
I think,
"I might get to see my kid,"

29:45.133 --> 29:47.500
we're going home,
not gonna get a chance.

29:47.567 --> 29:49.467
It's not only Beau that misses
out,

29:49.533 --> 29:52.300
I don't get to see
my old mate Harvey either.

29:52.367 --> 29:56.000
You know what, youse, right,
fuck Scott, fuck Anna,

29:56.067 --> 29:57.633
why don't we stay tonight?

29:57.700 --> 30:01.300
Literally go out, get on the bus
and go straight back to
Newcastle.

30:01.367 --> 30:05.333
I'll do that. I'd do that!
Fuck them.

30:05.400 --> 30:07.333
(yells) Fuck them!

30:07.400 --> 30:10.633
That's actually a very good
idea,
but I'm glad Chloe said it,

30:10.700 --> 30:13.533
because if Anna kicks off,
she's getting the blame.

30:13.600 --> 30:16.367
We're staying in Cardiff
tonight.
Yeah!

30:16.433 --> 30:18.933
Let's get properly ready
and tell the others.

30:23.867 --> 30:25.433
(Nathan) Finally!

30:25.500 --> 30:28.267
No, don't, "Hello," us!
You took so long, man.

30:28.333 --> 30:30.667
Seen how many layers
we had to peel off?

30:30.733 --> 30:33.567
I have got
the best plan ever, right.

30:33.633 --> 30:36.533
Why don't tonight, we stay here
and then go to the club

30:36.600 --> 30:38.633
and travel
back to Newcastle tonight?

30:38.700 --> 30:42.200
Chloe's usually pretty thick,
so this idea's fucking amazing.

30:42.267 --> 30:45.033
Gonna speak to my brother
and see if he can come out.

30:45.100 --> 30:48.167
Before we agree, if it does fall
on us, it was Chloe's idea.

30:48.233 --> 30:51.700
(all) One, two, three...
(all cheer)

30:53.667 --> 30:56.033
Fuck it,
if we get another night in
Cardiff,

30:56.100 --> 30:57.633
I'll happily take the blame.

31:03.100 --> 31:05.833
It's Beau.
I'm down in Cardiff at the
minute.

31:05.900 --> 31:08.100
You wanna come out
and meet us at Soda Bar?

31:10.433 --> 31:13.733
Got someone I want you to meet.
Beau has just told his brother

31:13.800 --> 31:15.433
that he wants him to meet us.

31:15.500 --> 31:18.367
Shit! I really hope
I make a good impression.

31:18.433 --> 31:22.067
Everyone straight in,
pack your shit, get ready

31:22.133 --> 31:24.700
and then we're fucking going
out.

31:27.833 --> 31:30.900
I'm devastated.
Harvey is huge.

31:30.967 --> 31:33.133
(all) Geordie shore, why-aye.

31:35.933 --> 31:36.133
.

31:38.633 --> 31:38.833
.

31:50.200 --> 31:52.567
Me and Beau,
we're in this new relationship,

31:52.633 --> 31:56.033
and when youse are in a new
relationship, at the beginning

31:56.100 --> 31:59.167
it's so sexually active.
You said "relationship".

31:59.233 --> 32:01.367
No, not...
(all cheer)

32:01.433 --> 32:06.000
Words are just falling out my
mouth.
Oh, God!

32:06.067 --> 32:10.867
Not relationship, not
boyfriend/girlfriend, a new
thing.

32:10.933 --> 32:14.100
Yeah, right! Yeah, yeah.
Now she's playing it cool,

32:14.167 --> 32:16.400
"Don't want a relationship."
You do!

32:16.467 --> 32:19.767
I hope Beau and Bethan are on
the same page about how they
feel,

32:19.833 --> 32:23.167
because if they're not,
shit is gonna go down. I know!

32:23.233 --> 32:26.333
Beau's got the brother out.
So, is he definitely coming?

32:26.400 --> 32:29.967
Yeah, he rang the brother
in the taxi on the way home,
yeah.

32:30.033 --> 32:32.800
I know Harvey,
and he's definitely Tahlia's
type.

32:32.867 --> 32:36.767
At least one leg of the tripod
is gonna be successful at
pulling.

32:36.833 --> 32:39.067
I just wanna thank you, Chloe,

32:39.133 --> 32:42.600
for coming up with the idea
of having one last night out.

32:42.667 --> 32:46.000
I feel like
that was a fantastic idea.

32:50.033 --> 32:55.000
Do I, tonight, go for the Miami
look,
or as if I'm dressed in
Columbia?

32:55.067 --> 32:58.400
Go for Columbia, cos no-one in
Miami
wears that. That's Japan.

32:58.467 --> 33:00.833
Where are you from?
Rio de Janeiro, baby.

33:00.900 --> 33:03.367
Rio De Janeiro, baby!

33:03.433 --> 33:05.200
Everyone's in good spirits.

33:05.267 --> 33:09.367
We might actually pull off this
trip
without anyone kicking off.

33:09.433 --> 33:13.733
How are you gonna introduce
Bethan?
"This is Bethan, my girlfriend,"

33:13.800 --> 33:15.700
Or, "This is Bethan, my friend"?

33:15.767 --> 33:17.967
"Here's Bethan,
the lass I'm shagging."

33:18.800 --> 33:21.533
I'm acting Billy Big Bollocks
in front of the lads,

33:21.600 --> 33:24.700
but I care if Harvey gets on
with Bethan, I like the girl.

33:24.767 --> 33:28.800
You're talking about taking it
slow,
Bethan's about to meet your
brother,

33:28.867 --> 33:31.733
a family member.
He's coming out to meet
everyone,

33:31.800 --> 33:33.133
not just to meet her.

33:33.200 --> 33:34.433
I'm not gonna admit it,

33:34.500 --> 33:37.167
but Harvey being out tonight
is a bit of a big deal.

33:37.233 --> 33:39.700
Me and him used to go out
on the pull all the time,

33:39.767 --> 33:41.367
but he's lost his wingman.

33:41.433 --> 33:44.867
We've managed to squeeze
an extra night out in Cardiff,

33:44.933 --> 33:47.367
let's fucking enjoy it
and go out with a bang.

33:53.167 --> 33:54.933
Beau's got bronzer on tonight!

33:57.033 --> 33:59.800
Hello.
Hello, ladies.

33:59.867 --> 34:02.533
Ooh, bitches!

34:02.600 --> 34:05.100
If Harvey is as fit
as I hope he's gonna be,

34:05.167 --> 34:09.033
I'm making sure that I'm looking
sex-to-the-E tonight!

34:10.233 --> 34:14.033
Obviously we're in Wales, so
it's
only fair we do the cheers in
Welsh.

34:14.100 --> 34:17.033
The Welsh way of saying cheers
is, "Iechyd da."

34:17.100 --> 34:21.300
Every day is a school day.
Cheers in Welsh is "lec-tar".

34:21.367 --> 34:24.266
One, two, three.
(all) Iechyd da!

34:24.333 --> 34:25.900
Lec-tar!

34:25.967 --> 34:27.833
That could mean fucking
anything.

34:27.900 --> 34:31.400
Tonight is our bonus night out,
so we need to make sure

34:31.467 --> 34:35.067
it's worth the hassle we're
gonna get
when someone finds out.

34:40.400 --> 34:43.000
The last night,
it's gonna be pure wicked!

34:43.067 --> 34:45.132
It's gonna go...
(all) ...off!

34:49.033 --> 34:52.067
I cannot believe I came up with
a genius idea like Einstein

34:52.132 --> 34:55.300
to stay in Cardiff one more
night.
I am fucking buzzing!

35:30.333 --> 35:33.633
It's been weird without Harvey,
so it's good to have him out.

35:33.700 --> 35:36.000
I just hope
that he gets on with everyone.

35:41.800 --> 35:46.233
Harvey has just walked in,
and fuck me sideways,

35:46.300 --> 35:50.600
that man
is a mountain I wanna climb.

35:57.167 --> 36:01.133
Harvey is that tall his head and
his feet are on different
postcodes.

36:02.533 --> 36:04.800
Harvey is huge,

36:04.867 --> 36:08.533
and from what I can see down
here,
he's looking mighty fine.

36:18.867 --> 36:22.133
Harvey has just walked in
and confidence is key,

36:22.200 --> 36:26.267
so I'm gonna walk over, before I
get
drunk and make a fool out of
myself.

36:30.533 --> 36:34.133
Bethan's wasted no time speaking
to
my brother. I hope they get on.

36:42.100 --> 36:46.300
Howay, Bethan, that is the most
stupid thing you have ever...

36:46.367 --> 36:48.400
What the fuck was that?!

36:52.033 --> 36:55.033
Fucking hell,
Bethan's cute, but she's a
divvy.

37:06.700 --> 37:09.433
I'm cutting to the chase,
no point messing around.

37:09.500 --> 37:10.967
Big brothers know best!

37:16.867 --> 37:18.800
Am I surrounded by thick
bastards?

37:18.867 --> 37:21.567
It's "eggs in a basket",
you fucking twat.

37:33.833 --> 37:37.600
I appreciate my brother's advice
and
he has my best interests at
heart,

37:37.667 --> 37:39.700
but I'm having more fun with
Bethan

37:39.767 --> 37:42.800
than shagging about,
so I don't see what the problem
is.

37:47.300 --> 37:50.567
I don't know why Bethan's
labelling it as a relationship.

37:50.633 --> 37:53.333
I've always made it clear
I wanna take things slow.

37:53.400 --> 37:55.167
Not ready to make it exclusive.

38:00.733 --> 38:04.433
Me and Bethan do need a talk
again.
That's our problem, not theirs.

38:12.133 --> 38:15.900
I swear
Harvey keeps giving me the eye.

38:15.967 --> 38:17.867
When is it my turn to talk to
him?

38:34.667 --> 38:36.367
This girl has caught feelings.

38:36.433 --> 38:38.867
I'm planning the wedding
way before tonight,

38:38.933 --> 38:40.767
I just hope Beau is ready for
it.

38:54.433 --> 38:59.367
So nice to finally flirt
with someone that I actually
fancy.

39:04.800 --> 39:07.233
Do I have to spell it out
for you, Harvey?

39:07.300 --> 39:10.600
He's sitting next to us,
and he's got a brother called
Beau!

39:20.500 --> 39:24.633
I haven't spoken to Harvey, but
you
can tell he is from Whitley Bay.

39:24.700 --> 39:26.367
He is necking on already!

39:30.600 --> 39:34.400
Since things ended with my ex,
I've
been looking to build my
confidence

39:34.467 --> 39:37.000
and Harvey is the kind of guy
to help me do that.

39:37.067 --> 39:38.767
This girl is moving on.

39:56.367 --> 39:58.400
Lovely to meet you, darling.

40:06.967 --> 40:10.500
I am gutted that Harvey has to
leave,
but he has got work tomorrow.

40:10.567 --> 40:13.000
I hope it's not the last time
I'm gonna see him.

40:18.700 --> 40:21.067
It's been class
catching up with my brother,

40:21.133 --> 40:22.833
and everyone loves him, too.

40:32.833 --> 40:36.567
Nat's got me worried. I'm not
saying
I wanna get with other girls,

40:36.633 --> 40:38.967
but I don't want to be tied down
just yet.

40:39.033 --> 40:41.600
I need to talk to Bethan
and clear this up.

41:00.133 --> 41:02.533
Aye, in my eyes,
that would be cheating,

41:02.600 --> 41:05.900
but if I tell Beau that,
it's only gonna push him away.

41:14.400 --> 41:17.033
I'm glad Bethan sees
where I'm coming from.

41:17.100 --> 41:20.233
I don't wanna rush things,
I hope we can continue as we
are.

41:29.233 --> 41:32.200
I can't believe
that I've read this so wrong.

41:32.267 --> 41:35.067
'Beau hasn't caught feelings
the way that I have.'

41:35.133 --> 41:37.333
I'm absolutely devastated.

41:47.467 --> 41:48.833
Let's get back to the bus!

41:52.000 --> 41:55.333
Once again, tonight has been
unreal.
No kick-offs,

41:55.400 --> 41:59.067
and we got to meet Harvey,
but we have to get back on that
bus.

42:01.367 --> 42:02.367
Bye, Cardiff!

42:04.233 --> 42:07.533
Tonight has been amazing,
but we need to get back on that
bus

42:07.600 --> 42:10.733
and back before Anna finds out
we're not in our beds.

42:10.800 --> 42:13.700
Oh, my God! Come on,
we've got no time like the
present!

42:13.767 --> 42:16.367
We need to get back to
Newcastle now! Hurry up!

42:16.433 --> 42:17.433
Hurry the fuck up!

42:21.167 --> 42:25.600
Get your clothes and we can go
home.
And you need to put this in
there.

42:25.667 --> 42:27.933
Chloe, I love you.
Love you.

42:28.000 --> 42:31.233
I'm gonna be honest, I wanna
spend
the rest of my life with you.

42:31.300 --> 42:34.300
Yeah, cool.
What? Cool?

42:34.367 --> 42:36.400
Chloe wants me to show her
affection,

42:36.467 --> 42:39.733
so I pour my heart out
and she says, "Cool."

42:39.800 --> 42:41.633
I can't win!

42:41.700 --> 42:43.900
I tell you what,
I feel like I'm married.

42:43.967 --> 42:45.733
You are married! Get in the
lift!

42:45.800 --> 42:47.100
Hurry up!

42:49.233 --> 42:52.000
Oh, my God!
Can you open the bus?

42:52.067 --> 42:55.600
Thank fuck the bus waited for
us.
Howay, let's get back to the
Toon.

42:55.667 --> 42:57.633
Get my lad's case on.

42:58.833 --> 43:02.867
What's the difference between
being late and being late? Nowt.

43:02.933 --> 43:05.567
Everyone's mortal,
these beds are comfortable,

43:05.633 --> 43:08.167
so it makes sense
to sleep the whole journey.

43:08.233 --> 43:11.367
Goodnight, everybody! Goodnight!

43:12.900 --> 43:14.600
Why don't we have a house party?

43:14.667 --> 43:16.867
You know Abbie's coming tonight?
I know.

43:16.933 --> 43:18.133
Oi, oi!

43:22.100 --> 43:24.167
I need to know
what he said to Abbie.

43:31.600 --> 43:33.333
Chloe has no right kicking off.

43:34.633 --> 43:37.733
I'm gutted. I've had so much fun
with him this time

43:37.800 --> 43:40.300
and I am going to miss him.

43:40.367 --> 43:43.067
I can't believe that's it.
I feel a bit sad.

43:43.133 --> 43:45.933
This is for you.
What the hell? But I love it!

43:46.000 --> 43:48.267
Chloe, I'm doing a piss in the
plant.

44:13.433 --> 44:13.633
.
