WEBVTT

00:14.607 --> 00:16.242
- Mon.

00:16.242 --> 00:17.242
- Gray.

00:17.242 --> 00:19.530
- This is a bit dramatic, innit?

00:19.530 --> 00:21.570
Early morning, abandoned warehouse.

00:23.330 --> 00:25.622
Just you, me, and the seagulls.

00:25.622 --> 00:27.670
- Yeah.

00:27.670 --> 00:29.693
Snidey little pricks laughing at us.

00:36.988 --> 00:37.821
- I missed him, Mon.

00:37.821 --> 00:39.121
- Hey, hey, hey, hey!

00:39.121 --> 00:40.171
We don't know he's dead yet.

00:40.171 --> 00:42.470
- I heard the shot!

00:42.470 --> 00:43.387
I heard it!

00:44.990 --> 00:46.240
I blame myself, you know?

00:47.780 --> 00:48.613
It's my fault!

00:48.613 --> 00:49.540
- Hey, hey, hey, don't you dare do that,

00:49.540 --> 00:50.610
it is not your fault!

00:50.610 --> 00:52.160
Don't you dare do that, it's...

00:52.995 --> 00:55.143
Look, it's Anne, mate.

00:56.160 --> 00:58.010
I'm sorry to say this, but she's a...

01:02.470 --> 01:03.770
She's a tell-tale tit.

01:04.603 --> 01:07.913
Yeah, and we need to take her out.

01:11.960 --> 01:13.393
- Say that again.

01:13.393 --> 01:16.150
I will shoot you, I will
shoot you in the eyes!

01:16.150 --> 01:18.810
- It doesn't have to be like this.

01:18.810 --> 01:20.860
- Right now, it's the only way it can be.

01:28.162 --> 01:29.977
- Look at you two, you're pathetic!

01:29.977 --> 01:31.440
Put your guns down.

01:31.440 --> 01:32.273
Put your guns down!

01:32.273 --> 01:36.727
- All right.

01:36.727 --> 01:39.360
- Right, as of 0900 hours this morning,

01:39.360 --> 01:42.330
Whitehall have officially
terminated Action Team

01:42.330 --> 01:44.077
as a secret branch at MI6.

01:44.910 --> 01:47.470
That means, I wanna thank
you for your services,

01:47.470 --> 01:48.812
but you're no longer required.

01:48.812 --> 01:49.800
- No!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on.

01:49.800 --> 01:50.900
What are you trying to say?

01:50.900 --> 01:53.900
- On Friday, you both partook
in an illegal mission,

01:53.900 --> 01:56.520
that I did not authorize,
where people were killed

01:56.520 --> 01:58.280
and half of Montenegro was smashed up!

01:58.280 --> 01:59.113
- Half?

01:59.113 --> 02:00.580
- Oh, well, she told you that, did she?

02:00.580 --> 02:02.920
Old, old ratty, old ratsville over there?

02:02.920 --> 02:05.210
Yeah, well, I tapped her phone last week.

02:05.210 --> 02:07.130
She was tipping off the kidnapper!

02:07.130 --> 02:08.479
She is Abacus!

02:08.479 --> 02:10.370
- She's Abacus!

02:10.370 --> 02:13.780
Right, now we're gonna wrap this up, okay?

02:13.780 --> 02:16.090
Because this is over with,
done here, this is it!

02:16.090 --> 02:20.183
I want to wish you the best
of luck, so best of luck.

02:21.260 --> 02:22.093
- See ya, Mon.
- No, no.

02:22.093 --> 02:23.320
- Cheers, Dougie, take it easy.

02:23.320 --> 02:26.033
- End line is, best of luck, okay?

02:28.090 --> 02:28.923
Best of luck.

02:29.790 --> 02:32.300
- We might go for a pint
Tuesday, if you fancy it?

02:32.300 --> 02:33.825
- Yeah, that sounds
nice, Dean, all the best.

02:33.825 --> 02:35.310
- No, no, no, no, no, no!

02:35.310 --> 02:36.170
No drinks!

02:36.170 --> 02:38.793
Shut up, shush, all of you!

02:40.090 --> 02:43.200
End line is best of luck.

02:43.200 --> 02:45.330
So, I'm wishing you the best of luck.

02:45.330 --> 02:46.295
Best of luck.

02:46.295 --> 02:47.128
- All right, all right.

02:47.128 --> 02:50.630
- Best of luck, both of you.

02:50.630 --> 02:51.463
Get in the car!

02:52.660 --> 02:53.493
Best of luck.

03:14.210 --> 03:17.628
- Mr. Logan, what a surprise!

03:17.628 --> 03:19.210
- Oh, God.

03:19.210 --> 03:21.330
As if my day wasn't crappy enough.

03:21.330 --> 03:24.447
- Before I forget it,
Samantha sends her greetings.

03:24.447 --> 03:26.044
We are going steady.

03:26.044 --> 03:27.470
- What the heck?

03:27.470 --> 03:29.260
Hey, do you know how
much I liked that girl?

03:29.260 --> 03:31.437
What are your intentions,
to hurt my feelings?

03:31.437 --> 03:34.191
- Well, not your feelings, just your body.

03:37.800 --> 03:39.970
Phew, that stinks!

03:39.970 --> 03:44.860
- My apologies, the diet here
has been somewhat cabbagey.

03:44.860 --> 03:46.450
- Enough!

03:46.450 --> 03:47.350
Bring in my tools.

03:54.230 --> 03:55.300
Come on, do you,

03:55.300 --> 03:58.570
do you have to do this every time now?

03:58.570 --> 03:59.700
- Well, I'm trying to hold them in.

03:59.700 --> 04:03.260
I mean, you punching me in the
stomach isn't really helping!

04:03.260 --> 04:05.020
- But what if
I punch you somewhere else?

04:05.020 --> 04:07.490
- Hey, how about you
don't punch me anywhere?

04:07.490 --> 04:08.612
- Maybe here.

04:13.010 --> 04:13.843
- What are you doing?

04:13.843 --> 04:15.631
You're taking off your shirt?

04:15.631 --> 04:18.420
As if I didn't feel
shitty enough about myself,

04:18.420 --> 04:20.577
you gotta make me body conscious?

04:20.577 --> 04:21.883
- So, where should we start?

04:26.595 --> 04:27.753
- Logan, catch!

04:27.753 --> 04:29.386
- Oh, ah, uh, my bad!

04:33.585 --> 04:35.676
Concentrate, concentrate
and throw, concentrate and,

04:35.676 --> 04:38.176
concentrate and throw, I said!

04:43.454 --> 04:44.843
- Yah!

04:44.843 --> 04:46.920
- Just to throw it under-arm.

04:46.920 --> 04:48.054
Take your time, take your time!

04:48.054 --> 04:49.753
Stop spinning it!

04:49.753 --> 04:51.357
Come on, man!

04:51.357 --> 04:54.170
- You know, I like you,
but that's a bad throw.

04:54.170 --> 04:56.500
You know, it's just not
good enough, really.

04:56.500 --> 04:59.600
All right, watch my armpits,
they're a little ripe.

05:01.569 --> 05:04.515
Hey, babe, thought you were dead.

05:04.515 --> 05:06.330
- I'm as good as dead.

05:06.330 --> 05:10.412
I know what Vlad has planned,
and only you, Logan Mann...

05:10.412 --> 05:11.650
Look at me!

05:11.650 --> 05:13.700
Only you can save the world.

05:13.700 --> 05:15.183
- I guess you're right.

05:16.320 --> 05:21.320
See, I didn't choose
action, action choose me.

05:21.410 --> 05:23.770
Now, come away with me!

05:23.770 --> 05:25.710
Otherwise they're gonna
know that you helped me.

05:25.710 --> 05:28.463
- No, I will say that you
beat me half to death.

05:30.414 --> 05:33.238
- Ah, no, don't, don't hit yourself!

05:34.997 --> 05:36.593
God, no, no, no, no, no!

05:37.426 --> 05:39.201
I'm not a woman beater!

05:39.201 --> 05:40.903
Oh, God, no!

05:40.903 --> 05:41.736
- Go!

05:41.736 --> 05:42.658
- God!

05:58.055 --> 05:59.805
- What?
- There he is.

06:00.768 --> 06:02.398
- Hey, baby!

06:07.748 --> 06:08.581
Oh, ow, ow.

06:10.830 --> 06:15.800
- Victor, welcome to
my evil Abacus network.

06:15.800 --> 06:16.980
- Wow.

06:16.980 --> 06:21.980
- Everybody, this is the
guy I was telling you about,

06:22.200 --> 06:24.823
who's going to build Super Mega Robot!

06:26.365 --> 06:28.960
Tell everybody about
it, tell them, tell us!

06:28.960 --> 06:32.680
- Oh, well, uh, okay.

06:32.680 --> 06:37.590
Uh, so, it's definitely a cool robot.

06:37.590 --> 06:39.420
And, um, big.

06:39.420 --> 06:41.550
- Tell us about the laser eyes!

06:41.550 --> 06:44.420
- Yeah, it's gonna have laser eyes.

06:44.420 --> 06:46.950
- I could sit here all day and talk about

06:46.950 --> 06:49.583
how amazing you are, sir,

06:50.970 --> 06:54.560
but I have attack on the West to plan,

06:54.560 --> 06:56.750
the Antelope's Tail to reclaim.

06:56.750 --> 06:57.973
La-la-la-la-la!

06:59.270 --> 07:01.660
How long until we can launch robot?

07:01.660 --> 07:05.040
- Uh, well, you see, that's the doozy.

07:05.040 --> 07:10.040
'Cause, um, the special
robot metal that I ordered,

07:10.570 --> 07:11.620
it's really expensive.

07:11.620 --> 07:14.433
So, I'm gonna need a little
more money, I'm afraid.

07:15.590 --> 07:17.090
- How much more do you need?

07:17.090 --> 07:20.670
- Not, I mean, like, a
million or two million.

07:20.670 --> 07:21.503
You know, nothing--

07:21.503 --> 07:23.310
- Whatever it takes.

07:23.310 --> 07:25.910
I need robot ready for tomorrow.

07:25.910 --> 07:26.888
- Tomorrow?

07:26.888 --> 07:28.246
Uh...

07:28.246 --> 07:31.161
- Will that be a problem?

07:31.161 --> 07:32.140
- Uh...

07:32.140 --> 07:34.070
- Problem, for this guy?

07:34.070 --> 07:35.393
You're the problem!

07:36.988 --> 07:39.200
- Well, well, I should
probably hit the road,

07:39.200 --> 07:41.003
if I'm gonna get the robot done.

07:41.880 --> 07:44.643
So have a great afternoon.

07:47.065 --> 07:48.648
- I don't like him.

07:50.457 --> 07:51.733
- You don't like anyone.

08:01.648 --> 08:03.977
- Oh, this is sad.

08:03.977 --> 08:05.735
Only number I remember and it's my own.

08:07.191 --> 08:09.060
I never thought it would end like this.

08:09.060 --> 08:09.893
- Hello?

08:09.893 --> 08:10.726
- Hello?

08:10.726 --> 08:12.040
Hello?

08:12.040 --> 08:13.217
Huxley, is that you?

08:13.217 --> 08:14.500
Hux, Hux, it's me!

08:14.500 --> 08:16.550
What are, what are you doing in my house?

08:16.550 --> 08:18.330
- Uh, feeding your cats while you're dead.

08:18.330 --> 08:20.430
- Well, I'm not dead anymore, kid.

08:20.430 --> 08:23.750
- Oh, yeah, yeah Logan,
um, my internship's done,

08:23.750 --> 08:25.340
so I need a reference.

08:25.340 --> 08:27.000
- Of course, I'd do that for
you, it's fine, it's cool.

08:27.000 --> 08:28.468
- Uh, yeah, look, Logan, like,

08:28.468 --> 08:29.770
I don't know what to do, you know?

08:29.770 --> 08:31.890
My mum's on my case, like,
I wanted to do sociology,

08:31.890 --> 08:34.630
but the course is full, and
also I wanna learn Swahili,

08:34.630 --> 08:36.650
'cause I might travel one
day around the world, Logan--

08:36.650 --> 08:38.899
- Kid, kid? Buddy, buddy--
- I want to be a DJ,

08:38.899 --> 08:39.798
but I'm not sure--
- Now is not the time!

08:39.798 --> 08:40.631
- If my mum's happy about that,

08:40.631 --> 08:42.106
so I might just, you know, look at

08:42.106 --> 08:43.750
a sports science course.
- That's fine.

08:43.750 --> 08:44.682
All brilliant ideas!

08:44.682 --> 08:46.180
Listen, listen, kid, kid, kid?

08:46.180 --> 08:50.000
You're gonna take this
address down for me.

08:50.000 --> 08:53.380
Nihad Fortress, Stoppoli Islands, Russia.

08:54.586 --> 08:56.593
- All right, got it, Russia, thank you!

08:56.593 --> 08:57.720
- No, no, no, no!

08:57.720 --> 09:00.180
Russia's a massive place,
it's the biggest country

09:00.180 --> 09:01.324
in the world nearly!

09:01.324 --> 09:02.582
Jesus, Hux!

09:02.582 --> 09:03.415
Hux?

09:03.415 --> 09:04.248
Hux, please!

09:12.280 --> 09:14.810
- Hello, Anne Bishop speaking.

09:14.810 --> 09:15.697
- Dmitry?

09:15.697 --> 09:17.581
- Yes, it's Dmitry.

09:17.581 --> 09:19.427
- How is mission?

09:19.427 --> 09:21.473
- I don't know, man.

09:23.300 --> 09:25.603
I'm in deep, perhaps too deep.

09:28.340 --> 09:32.180
- I pay you to go real deep.

09:32.180 --> 09:34.284
What is your problem?

09:34.284 --> 09:36.813
- I am involved with
member of the Action Team.

09:37.710 --> 09:39.623
His name is Graham, I...

09:40.970 --> 09:43.113
Lines have all become fuzzy blur.

09:44.040 --> 09:45.160
I guess...

09:46.840 --> 09:49.322
Well, I think I care about him.

09:49.322 --> 09:51.090
- You know what I didn't do?

09:51.090 --> 09:54.593
I didn't call up for a
little girly catch-up.

09:55.510 --> 09:57.703
This is not "Sex In The American City".

09:58.558 --> 10:00.880
Do not lose focus!

10:00.880 --> 10:03.263
You make Antelope's Tail your priority.

10:04.130 --> 10:07.503
And now, I'll give you big ultimatum.

10:08.458 --> 10:10.833
You must kill this Graham.

10:12.332 --> 10:13.684
- Or what?

10:13.684 --> 10:14.880
- What do you mean or what?

10:14.880 --> 10:16.920
Just kill him and kill him dead.

10:16.920 --> 10:18.550
- Yeah, but you said you give me ultimatum

10:18.550 --> 10:20.533
but you not give me two choices.

10:20.533 --> 10:22.260
- All right, all right, yep,

10:22.260 --> 10:24.730
I now understand what you're getting at.

10:24.730 --> 10:28.080
You kill Graham or you have
to sing your favorite song

10:28.080 --> 10:31.030
in front of whole of Abacus organization.

10:31.030 --> 10:33.393
- No, that doesn't work,
because I like to sing,

10:33.393 --> 10:34.880
that is good for me.

10:34.880 --> 10:37.660
- You know what, you kill Graham,

10:37.660 --> 10:40.310
or I kill your whole family

10:40.310 --> 10:43.400
with a big, angry lion called Thomas!

10:43.400 --> 10:46.393
- That's it, that is ultimatum.

10:48.500 --> 10:49.333
Boss?

10:50.250 --> 10:51.083
Boss?

10:52.863 --> 10:53.696
Oh, shit.

11:16.300 --> 11:17.783
Well, this is a surprise.

11:18.660 --> 11:19.640
An unexpected visitor.

11:19.640 --> 11:21.353
- Oh, yeah.

11:26.507 --> 11:28.802
- I'm so sorry about today, Graham.

11:28.802 --> 11:30.253
- Yeah.

11:31.570 --> 11:33.920
Bit of a stinker for
Graham Hooper, all in all.

11:35.010 --> 11:38.133
My best mate's carked
it, I've lost my job,

11:39.196 --> 11:41.223
Monica's lost her mind,

11:43.460 --> 11:45.520
and bloody all of it can
just sod off, actually.

11:45.520 --> 11:48.550
- Oh, darling, you've got
yourself into such a state.

11:48.550 --> 11:52.200
Look, why don't you go and
grab yourself a wee beer?

11:52.200 --> 11:54.040
I'm just gonna pop into the shower,

11:54.040 --> 11:57.507
because I'm all sweaty
after my workout video.

12:31.233 --> 12:33.483
- It's just a book, Graham.

12:43.010 --> 12:44.323
Now, that is a big shoe.

12:50.262 --> 12:52.693
Okay, okay.

12:53.830 --> 12:56.153
No, give her a chance.

12:57.170 --> 12:59.883
Give her a chance, Gray, because, um,

13:01.300 --> 13:03.390
you don't know, she might be, uh...

13:05.060 --> 13:05.893
Shit.

13:23.595 --> 13:24.428
Anne?

13:35.970 --> 13:38.090
Well, that confirms it, doesn't it?

13:38.090 --> 13:39.670
I'm gonna assume that
Anne's not your real name.

13:39.670 --> 13:41.023
- I am Dmitry.

13:42.327 --> 13:43.830
Abacus.

13:43.830 --> 13:44.663
- Touche.

13:46.629 --> 13:48.129
You had me fooled.

13:50.250 --> 13:52.750
Everyone in the office
is gonna be really upset.

13:52.750 --> 13:53.660
You're very good at your job.

13:53.660 --> 13:56.761
Now would you kindly put some
knickers on before we do this?

14:00.456 --> 14:01.289
That's it.

14:05.064 --> 14:06.397
- On your knees.

14:09.527 --> 14:10.694
On your knees!

14:23.070 --> 14:25.617
I did not mean for things to get so--

14:26.550 --> 14:27.530
- What?

14:27.530 --> 14:28.363
Lovely?

14:28.363 --> 14:29.305
Best time of our lives?

14:29.305 --> 14:31.500
- Yes, all of those things.

14:31.500 --> 14:32.670
You are right to be angry.

14:32.670 --> 14:35.999
- Oh, I am angry, Anne,
Dmitry, whoever you are.

14:35.999 --> 14:37.783
I'm angry with both of you, to be honest.

14:50.141 --> 14:51.974
- Goodbye, lovely man.

15:08.090 --> 15:09.183
- Come on, Tina.

15:11.620 --> 15:12.453
Hey!

15:13.820 --> 15:15.770
- How is progress on robot?

15:15.770 --> 15:19.612
- It's on its way here in a robot truck.

15:19.612 --> 15:20.779
- Robot truck?

15:21.862 --> 15:24.110
- Cough, cough.

15:24.110 --> 15:25.282
Bullshit.

15:25.282 --> 15:26.860
There is no robot.

15:26.860 --> 15:28.723
- Ow .

15:28.723 --> 15:32.210
- Oh, there's nothing
as bitter and twisted

15:32.210 --> 15:36.497
as a jealous invalid
and a vicious old man.

15:38.537 --> 15:39.853
How is my robot?

15:41.081 --> 15:43.810
- Oh, man, you're gonna look so cool

15:43.810 --> 15:45.543
in this thing, I promise.

15:46.410 --> 15:48.400
- Did you just say look?

15:48.400 --> 15:49.620
Look?

15:49.620 --> 15:51.140
I'm going to wear it?

15:51.140 --> 15:53.990
- Well, yeah, I mean, that's
the vibe I'm going for.

15:53.990 --> 15:55.691
Unless you don't want something
that cool, then I could--

15:55.691 --> 15:57.688
- No, no, no, no, no.

15:57.688 --> 16:01.077
I want cool, I want the coolest one!

16:04.100 --> 16:05.593
But answer me something.

16:07.550 --> 16:09.480
Will it fly?

16:09.480 --> 16:12.548
- No, I'm gonna put my main
man in a robot that can't fly.

16:12.548 --> 16:14.689
What kinda robot can't fly?

16:22.230 --> 16:23.397
- And connect.

16:24.630 --> 16:26.170
Okay, good morning everybody.

16:26.170 --> 16:28.940
This call is being hosted
by Vladimir Shevchenko.

16:28.940 --> 16:31.240
Right, and present we have USA, France,

16:31.240 --> 16:33.060
China, Italy, and Australia.

16:33.060 --> 16:33.893
- Listen up!

16:35.500 --> 16:40.500
I have built Super Mega Robot
to launch attack on West

16:43.260 --> 16:48.260
unless I'm handed back
Antelope's Tail, with an apology!

16:49.400 --> 16:52.910
I shall launch at midnight tonight.

16:52.910 --> 16:54.686
- In what time zone?

16:54.686 --> 16:56.540
- What you mean in what time zone?

16:56.540 --> 16:59.180
- Midnight your time or ours?

16:59.180 --> 17:01.520
- Just midnight, it is perfectly simple.

17:01.520 --> 17:03.230
Just the middle part of the night,

17:03.230 --> 17:05.750
from 12 a.m. is midnight, right?

17:05.750 --> 17:10.750
- Uh, no. midnight isn't
the same as midnight here.

17:11.010 --> 17:12.100
- Hm, what?

17:12.100 --> 17:14.600
- Uh, Mr. Shevchenko, you
realize the world works

17:14.600 --> 17:16.230
on contrasting time zones, right?

17:16.230 --> 17:18.620
- It's just midnight, mid night.

17:18.620 --> 17:20.020
It's like the middle of the night.

17:20.020 --> 17:22.820
It's not the first bit
of it or the last bit,

17:22.820 --> 17:24.330
it's this bit in the middle, right?

17:24.330 --> 17:28.653
- Midnight Moscow time
is like seven a.m. here.

17:29.842 --> 17:30.970
- Mm-hm?

17:30.970 --> 17:32.517
Yes.

17:32.517 --> 17:34.310
Completely .

17:34.310 --> 17:38.752
It will be midnight Russian time.

17:38.752 --> 17:40.900
- That would be five in the morning here,

17:40.900 --> 17:42.410
so not so good for us.

17:42.410 --> 17:46.620
- Oh, I'm sorry you'll have to
get up early, creepy dragon!

17:46.620 --> 17:50.429
Why has everybody got
an opinion about this?

17:50.429 --> 17:54.862
It's just midnight Russian time, right?

18:00.899 --> 18:01.732
- Hello?

18:09.700 --> 18:10.533
Conceded.

18:10.533 --> 18:11.675
- Hm.

18:12.990 --> 18:14.600
- I owe you an apology, friend.

18:14.600 --> 18:17.687
- Yeah, well, I won't harp on about it.

18:17.687 --> 18:21.013
But I told you she was a
mole, dirty cow.

18:22.520 --> 18:24.069
- Oh, it gets worse.

18:24.069 --> 18:27.903
And I hate to say this,
actually, but she was a bloke.

18:30.070 --> 18:31.150
- A what?

18:31.150 --> 18:32.670
- She was a fella.

18:32.670 --> 18:34.250
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

18:34.250 --> 18:35.440
You 100% sure about this?

18:35.440 --> 18:36.340
- She had a penis.

18:37.569 --> 18:39.164
A big old willy.

18:39.164 --> 18:40.739
- Ah.

18:40.739 --> 18:41.868
Circumcised?

18:41.868 --> 18:42.701
- Oh, no.

18:44.080 --> 18:46.280
I've never in my life
seen so much foreskin,

18:47.658 --> 18:49.230
it was like a boot-cut jean.

18:49.230 --> 18:50.790
- Yeah?

18:50.790 --> 18:51.623
- A bell bottom.

18:53.240 --> 18:56.269
Like one of those tunnels
that dogs scurry through.

18:56.269 --> 18:57.102
- Oh.

18:58.690 --> 18:59.523
Nice!

18:59.523 --> 19:03.020
- Yeah, well, he was truly
a master of disguise.

19:03.020 --> 19:04.430
- Mm, hm.

19:04.430 --> 19:05.730
- And I imagine he's headed straight

19:05.730 --> 19:07.030
for the Antelope's Tail.

19:07.030 --> 19:07.863
- Yeah.

19:09.060 --> 19:10.954
- And fair play to her.
- Well, him.

19:13.257 --> 19:14.790
- Yeah.

19:19.106 --> 19:20.023
- Hey, hey!

19:21.320 --> 19:23.403
Hey there, hey, hey, hey!

19:24.524 --> 19:25.441
Stop, stop!

19:43.654 --> 19:45.188
What, Hux?

19:45.188 --> 19:46.621
What?

19:48.244 --> 19:50.941
Oh, I can't believe it!

19:50.941 --> 19:51.891
Hey, buddy!

19:58.556 --> 20:02.389
- For too long, you
people have sneered at me.

20:03.490 --> 20:05.940
Laughed at me!

20:05.940 --> 20:06.773
But no more!

20:08.120 --> 20:10.941
Behold and be fearful

20:12.160 --> 20:14.963
of my Super Mega Robot!

20:15.940 --> 20:18.290
- Now, Mr. Shevchenko, we do not want

20:18.290 --> 20:20.120
this to become a situation.

20:20.120 --> 20:25.120
- Get ready for judgment day.

20:25.620 --> 20:26.720
Hour!

20:26.720 --> 20:30.980
Get ready for judgment hour!

20:30.980 --> 20:32.890
- Are you reading off cue cards?

20:32.890 --> 20:33.723
- No.

20:36.726 --> 20:40.280
That is a ridiculous thing, enough talk!

20:40.280 --> 20:45.280
Time for you to witness the
power of my Super Mega Robot.

20:47.470 --> 20:50.820
Watch my deadly lasers.

20:50.820 --> 20:53.070
Eat laser, goat!

20:53.070 --> 20:54.210
Stupid goat!

20:54.210 --> 20:55.413
Eat laser!

20:56.760 --> 21:00.300
Oh, dear goat, why are
you not eating laser?

21:01.240 --> 21:02.320
Is that a goat?

21:02.320 --> 21:03.720
That looks like a sheep.

21:03.720 --> 21:04.730
- Just goat.

21:04.730 --> 21:05.740
- It definitely a goat?

21:05.740 --> 21:06.573
- From my mother's farm,
it's a pedigree goat.

21:09.110 --> 21:10.367
- For you, is that goat?

21:10.367 --> 21:13.790
- Uh, I mean, it's got
curly hair like a sheep,

21:13.790 --> 21:15.750
but it has horns like
a goat, I don't know.

21:15.750 --> 21:17.360
- It's not a sheep-goat?

21:17.360 --> 21:19.675
- No, I mean, I don't
know, I'm not a farmer.

21:19.675 --> 21:20.747
- He doesn't know.

21:20.747 --> 21:22.790
- Eat laser, goat!

21:25.530 --> 21:27.040
Why is the goat not exploding?

21:27.040 --> 21:30.620
- Okay, goats are invincible to lasers,

21:30.620 --> 21:32.830
it's like a superpower they have!

21:32.830 --> 21:33.980
- Yes, I've heard that.

21:35.010 --> 21:35.843
All right.

21:37.050 --> 21:41.940
For too long, man has been
confined to the floor,

21:41.940 --> 21:46.153
scared of the possibility of flight!

21:47.610 --> 21:48.920
Really?

21:48.920 --> 21:51.840
There isn't, there's
not an automatic switch?

21:51.840 --> 21:53.563
- No, it's safer that way.

21:55.443 --> 21:57.513
- Time to take to the skies!

22:02.420 --> 22:04.113
Time to take to the skies!

22:07.830 --> 22:10.290
You're chomping my pecker, right?

22:10.290 --> 22:11.403
This is humiliating.

22:13.821 --> 22:15.303
Explain yourself, Victor.

22:17.050 --> 22:20.483
- I, you know, I forgot
the, the rocket toes.

22:20.483 --> 22:21.316
- Enough!

22:23.170 --> 22:24.984
Feed him to your mother's pigs.

22:35.750 --> 22:38.070
- Right, well, thank you
for this, Mr. Shevchenko.

22:38.070 --> 22:41.100
This has been a rather
amusing and, should I say,

22:41.100 --> 22:43.670
fitting end to this
whole affair .

22:43.670 --> 22:44.700
Good night.

22:44.700 --> 22:47.663
- Hold onto your horse, Ms. Brooks.

22:48.990 --> 22:52.100
Don't you know that it is customary

22:52.100 --> 22:56.880
when playing poker to
check for ace in pack

22:57.960 --> 23:00.263
before you believe you have a flush?

23:01.740 --> 23:06.740
- Say hello to Anne for
me, won't you?
