WEBVTT

00:03.754 --> 00:04.619
Let's go. Let's go.

00:04.838 --> 00:05.919
We're gonna be late!

00:06.340 --> 00:07.830
<i>Fun fact... the first time</i>

00:08.050 --> 00:10.337
<i>I almost died was
at the age of nine.</i>

00:10.552 --> 00:11.383
<i>The murder weapon?</i>

00:11.595 --> 00:13.257
<i>A Jimmy Dean sausage.</i>

00:18.644 --> 00:21.352
Mom, Sheldon's
making faces at me.

00:23.732 --> 00:24.347
Sheldon!

00:24.566 --> 00:25.556
<i>In fairness to Mr. Dean...</i>

00:25.776 --> 00:27.483
- Honey!
<i>- ...this one morning, I decided</i>

00:27.694 --> 00:30.311
<i>to forgo my normal
20 chews per bite,</i>

00:30.531 --> 00:32.989
<i>as prescribed by the
American Medical Association.</i>

00:33.200 --> 00:34.031
George, help!

00:36.495 --> 00:39.078
Come here, boy. We got it.
We just got to smack it out.

00:39.289 --> 00:40.655
<i>To further complicate matters,</i>

00:40.874 --> 00:42.581
<i>in any real-life crisis,</i>

00:42.793 --> 00:45.877
<i>my family's default mode
is mindless panic.</i>

00:46.088 --> 00:48.125
Sheldon's gonna die!
Sheldon's gonna die!

00:48.340 --> 00:49.706
<i>Or heartless apathy.</i>

00:50.259 --> 00:51.625
<i>Oh, Lord.</i>

00:51.843 --> 00:53.129
Here we go.
This is how you do it.

00:53.345 --> 00:55.632
- Here we go. And we shake.
- Honey!

00:56.056 --> 00:58.013
<i>It's interesting
the things you think about</i>

00:58.225 --> 01:00.057
<i>when life is ebbing
from your body.</i>

01:00.269 --> 01:03.307
<i>For instance, linoleum.
What is it, really?</i>

01:03.522 --> 01:06.640
<i>Plastic? And if so, how is it
different from Formica?</i>

01:06.858 --> 01:08.190
I'm calling 911.

01:10.487 --> 01:12.194
<i>And what about Count Chocula?</i>

01:12.447 --> 01:13.688
<i>How is he a count?</i>

01:13.907 --> 01:15.318
<i>Did the title come with land?</i>

01:15.534 --> 01:16.365
George, Heimlich!

01:18.203 --> 01:20.536
<i>Don't hurt his little ribs!</i>

01:20.747 --> 01:22.238
<i>They say, in the final moments,</i>

01:22.457 --> 01:24.790
<i>your life passes
before your eyes.</i>

01:25.043 --> 01:28.127
<i>All I saw was my brother
licking jelly off the knife</i>

01:28.338 --> 01:29.704
<i>and putting it back in the jar.</i>

01:31.800 --> 01:33.211
Okay, it's better now. Sheldon!

01:33.468 --> 01:36.176
Honey. Are you okay?

01:36.388 --> 01:37.799
Can you breathe?
Say something!

01:38.015 --> 01:40.803
You have to... throw
away... that jelly.

02:05.334 --> 02:07.496
I've never been late
to school before.

02:07.711 --> 02:09.747
I'm late all the time.
It's no big deal.

02:09.963 --> 02:12.580
I get you to school on time
every day. Why are you late?

02:12.799 --> 02:15.212
I have a lot of people
to say hi to in the morning.

02:15.427 --> 02:16.042
<i>Mom,</i>

02:16.261 --> 02:17.422
would you write a note for me?

02:18.013 --> 02:18.799
Sure.

02:19.014 --> 02:20.721
You have the coolest excuse.

02:20.932 --> 02:23.515
You almost died.
Did you see Jesus?

02:23.810 --> 02:26.018
I saw Count Chocula.

02:26.688 --> 02:29.681
But feel free to mention
my brush with death in the note.

02:29.900 --> 02:32.267
All right, that's enough
talk about death and dying.

02:33.362 --> 02:36.196
I came this close to
having my own room.

02:39.451 --> 02:40.908
<i>Remember, the food drive</i>

02:41.119 --> 02:41.859
ends Friday.

02:42.079 --> 02:43.741
All canned goods
are welcome.

02:44.039 --> 02:47.828
But please... make sure
your cans have labels.

02:48.043 --> 02:49.124
Needy people
have enough problems

02:49.336 --> 02:51.669
without having to guess
what's for dinner.

02:51.880 --> 02:54.418
I'm sorry I'm late.
I have a note.

02:57.302 --> 03:00.010
You poor thing, you had
a medical emergency?

03:00.222 --> 03:02.760
Yes, ma'am.
I choked on a sausage.

03:04.017 --> 03:05.133
<i>How big was it?</i>

03:05.602 --> 03:07.264
About yay big.

03:11.024 --> 03:11.730
<i>To this day,</i>

03:11.942 --> 03:14.434
<i>I still don't understand
why they were laughing.</i>

03:21.159 --> 03:22.695
You're sitting in my spot.

03:23.995 --> 03:24.826
Why is it your spot?

03:25.038 --> 03:26.745
It's complicated.
Just move.

03:33.797 --> 03:36.881
- You're reading a comic book.
- I am.

03:37.175 --> 03:39.588
You do understand
those are for children.

03:40.262 --> 03:41.173
Have you ever read one?

03:41.638 --> 03:44.221
I outgrew picture books
when I was three.

03:44.433 --> 03:45.344
Just eat your lunch.

04:02.534 --> 04:03.490
What's the matter?

04:04.661 --> 04:06.698
I-I don't think
I can eat this.

04:06.913 --> 04:08.120
You want to trade?

04:08.749 --> 04:10.206
My mom made me
fish soup again.

04:10.417 --> 04:11.828
How long do we have
to be in this country

04:12.002 --> 04:13.538
before I get baloney?

04:17.007 --> 04:19.339
Mm, no, thank you.

04:19.551 --> 04:20.791
I'm not hungry.

04:21.595 --> 04:22.927
"I'm not hungry."

04:24.222 --> 04:26.305
Three words you never hear
in Vietnam.

04:28.059 --> 04:29.971
<i>Well, here's
something nice.</i>

04:30.187 --> 04:31.723
You know
that Mr. Rosenbloom

04:31.938 --> 04:34.396
with the furniture store
over by the steakhouse?

04:34.775 --> 04:37.017
- I don't think so.
<i>- Oh, sure you do.</i>

04:37.235 --> 04:38.771
That Hebrew fella
with the comb-over?

04:38.987 --> 04:40.023
You mean Jewish?

04:40.322 --> 04:42.484
I think they like
to be called Hebrew.

04:43.283 --> 04:44.023
Anyway,

04:45.285 --> 04:46.821
he's asked me to dinner.

04:47.954 --> 04:49.786
Well, good for you.
What'd you say?

04:50.165 --> 04:51.997
I said I'd have
to think about it.

04:52.209 --> 04:53.165
What's to think about?

04:53.376 --> 04:54.912
Well, a lot.

04:55.128 --> 04:57.711
I mean, assuming he enjoys
dinner, he might want

04:57.923 --> 04:59.664
a scoop of Meemaw for dessert.

04:59.883 --> 05:01.249
Mom, the kids.

05:01.885 --> 05:03.467
I said "dessert."

05:03.678 --> 05:05.544
Did you know
I was talking about sex?

05:06.097 --> 05:06.803
No.

05:07.015 --> 05:08.256
See?

05:10.393 --> 05:11.509
Why aren't you eating?

05:12.270 --> 05:13.886
I don't think I can.

05:14.105 --> 05:16.438
Sometimes the different foods
touch each other, Sheldon.

05:16.650 --> 05:17.731
Not the end of the world.

05:17.943 --> 05:20.310
No, I'm afraid I'll choke again.

05:20.695 --> 05:23.028
Oh, honey, that's
not gonna happen.

05:23.240 --> 05:24.447
Go ahead, eat your dinner.

05:24.658 --> 05:26.115
What's all this about choking?

05:26.368 --> 05:27.904
Sheldon almost died
this morning.

05:28.119 --> 05:29.451
- What?!
- Oh, yeah.

05:29.663 --> 05:31.996
Dad was shaking him upside down
like a ketchup bottle.

05:32.207 --> 05:33.493
It was great.

05:33.750 --> 05:35.286
Well, you got to eat
something, baby.

05:35.502 --> 05:36.618
Just have a few bites.

05:36.837 --> 05:38.749
I can't. It's too risky.

05:38.964 --> 05:40.205
Dibs on the tater tots.

05:40.549 --> 05:41.915
All right, I'll wrap
that up for you,

05:42.133 --> 05:44.591
and if you change your mind,
you can have some later.

05:44.803 --> 05:46.010
At least drink your milk.

05:46.847 --> 05:47.507
Sure.

05:48.014 --> 05:49.255
<i>My mother and father saw</i>

05:49.474 --> 05:52.683
<i>that I'd been traumatized and
were patient and understanding</i>

05:52.894 --> 05:55.602
<i>about my fear
of eating solid foods.</i>

05:56.022 --> 05:57.684
<i>This lasted one more day.</i>

05:57.899 --> 05:59.106
<i>Sheldon Lee Cooper,
if you don't</i>

05:59.317 --> 06:01.149
finish that pork chop,
I swear I will chew it up

06:01.361 --> 06:02.977
and spit it in your mouth
like a mama bird.

06:03.196 --> 06:04.107
Do it, Mom. Do it.

06:04.322 --> 06:06.439
- Mary, can I speak to you for a second?
- No. Enough is enough.

06:06.658 --> 06:08.274
The boy has got to eat.

06:08.493 --> 06:09.654
Just give me a minute.

06:12.664 --> 06:14.075
Start eating, mister.

06:17.752 --> 06:19.084
You don't mind, right?

06:22.549 --> 06:24.290
How about I cut that
pork chop off the bone

06:24.509 --> 06:27.126
and throw it in the
blender with some gravy?

06:28.763 --> 06:31.426
If it fits through
a bendy straw, I'll drink it.

06:31.641 --> 06:32.757
Coming up.

06:34.477 --> 06:36.093
Why does he get a pork shake?

06:36.313 --> 06:37.520
This is all my fault.

06:37.731 --> 06:39.313
I rushed him through
breakfast the other day,

06:39.524 --> 06:41.186
and now look...
he is wasting away.

06:41.401 --> 06:43.313
Oh, come on.
You can't blame yourself.

06:43.528 --> 06:45.520
This isn't gonna last. Remember
the time a bee got in the house

06:45.739 --> 06:47.696
and he slept under a net
for a couple months?

06:47.908 --> 06:49.149
This is different.

06:49.367 --> 06:50.323
- How?
<i>- First of all,</i>

06:50.535 --> 06:51.321
you let that bee in.

06:51.536 --> 06:52.526
The bee was your fault.

06:52.746 --> 06:53.987
- Okay.
- Secondly,

06:54.205 --> 06:55.446
this is about his health.

06:55.665 --> 06:56.746
He is a fragile little boy.

06:56.958 --> 06:58.119
<i>He can't go on like this.</i>

06:58.335 --> 06:59.416
I'm not arguing with you.

06:59.628 --> 07:01.995
Let's just, you know,
give him a little more time.

07:07.344 --> 07:08.551
Now what?

07:08.845 --> 07:10.586
Sounds like your mom's
making margaritas.

07:14.017 --> 07:14.928
What's he drinking?

07:15.185 --> 07:16.892
Pork chop and gravy.

07:17.562 --> 07:19.019
I snuck
some broccoli in there, too.

07:19.230 --> 07:20.937
Shh...

07:41.002 --> 07:42.743
I'm real glad
you've been getting out again.

07:42.963 --> 07:44.454
Me, too.

07:44.673 --> 07:47.006
We had a nice dinner,
took a walk.

07:47.384 --> 07:49.046
He's a divorcÃ©, you know.

07:49.260 --> 07:50.250
I didn't.

07:50.470 --> 07:52.086
It's not a big deal
for those people.

07:52.305 --> 07:55.264
If they're not a lawyer,
they're related to one.

07:56.309 --> 07:57.345
You're actually
cutting the crust off

07:57.560 --> 07:58.846
- before you blend it?
- I left it

07:59.062 --> 08:01.645
on his tuna sandwich yesterday,
he said he could tell.

08:01.856 --> 08:03.097
Only drank half of it.

08:04.025 --> 08:05.311
Mary, you think this has
gone on long enough?

08:05.986 --> 08:06.772
No trouble.

08:06.987 --> 08:09.104
But it'd be better
if I had two blenders.

08:09.322 --> 08:10.688
Be better if you stopped
coddling him.

08:10.907 --> 08:12.398
Well, I don't know
what else to do.

08:12.617 --> 08:14.529
I suggested that we take him
to some kind of professional,

08:14.744 --> 08:16.201
but you said he'd outgrow it.

08:16.413 --> 08:17.699
Well, if you're looking
for a psychiatrist,

08:17.914 --> 08:20.702
I bet my new fella's
related to one.

08:23.545 --> 08:24.376
What do you think?

08:27.173 --> 08:27.959
Not sure.

08:28.967 --> 08:30.424
If we take him to a shrink,
it feels like we're admitting

08:30.635 --> 08:31.671
something's wrong with him.

08:31.886 --> 08:34.378
He hasn't had solid food
in five weeks.

08:35.140 --> 08:38.383
Well, if there is
something wrong with him,

08:38.601 --> 08:39.842
it ain't constipation.

08:46.067 --> 08:46.682
Okay.

08:46.901 --> 08:48.517
Let's see if we
can find somebody.

08:48.737 --> 08:49.773
Thank you.

08:50.989 --> 08:51.854
Hmm.

08:57.620 --> 08:59.111
Needs a few more Cheetos.

09:00.290 --> 09:03.249
<i>My mother managed
to locate a family psychiatrist</i>

09:03.460 --> 09:04.826
<i>within our price range.</i>

09:05.211 --> 09:06.952
<i>No one seemed to be bothered
that he had</i>

09:07.172 --> 09:09.380
<i>a coupon in</i> The Pennysaver.

09:09.924 --> 09:12.667
Is this man gonna make me
eat solid foods?

09:12.886 --> 09:14.752
No, he just wants to
talk to you about it.

09:14.971 --> 09:17.384
Did you tell him I have
a lot to accomplish in my life

09:17.599 --> 09:20.933
and cannot afford to be killed
by an unchewed sausage?

09:21.770 --> 09:23.557
Not in those exact words.

09:27.525 --> 09:28.857
Did you bring
the coupon?

09:30.111 --> 09:31.318
Hi. Welcome.

09:31.529 --> 09:32.770
You must be the Cooper family.

09:32.989 --> 09:33.729
We are.

09:33.948 --> 09:35.359
Right on, right on.

09:35.784 --> 09:37.070
This must be Sheldon.

09:37.410 --> 09:38.400
Put 'er there.

09:39.370 --> 09:40.577
No, thank you.

09:41.498 --> 09:42.705
Right on, right on.

09:42.916 --> 09:45.203
Okay, well, here's how
I'd like to start. Mom and Dad,

09:45.418 --> 09:47.580
why don't you come talk to me
first, and then, Sheldon,

09:47.796 --> 09:49.788
you and I have
a little rap session.

09:50.507 --> 09:51.167
Folks?

09:56.513 --> 09:57.970
Right on, right on.

09:58.640 --> 10:00.632
Feel free to read
any of my comics.

10:04.604 --> 10:06.687
And you guys feel free
to sit on my beanbag!

10:12.028 --> 10:14.645
40 cents? Outrageous.

10:14.864 --> 10:16.230
<i>As fate would have it,</i>

10:16.449 --> 10:19.442
<i>the comic I picked up
was called X-Men.</i>

10:19.661 --> 10:21.869
<i>Young mutants
with incredible powers</i>

10:22.080 --> 10:24.117
<i>who were feared
and misunderstood</i>

10:24.332 --> 10:25.994
<i>by the entire world.</i>

10:26.209 --> 10:28.451
Hey, it's about me.

10:29.754 --> 10:31.746
Now, the thing
you have to understand is

10:31.965 --> 10:33.627
<i>Shelly is
incredibly bright.</i>

10:33.842 --> 10:36.755
I mean, his IQ is right up there
with Albert Einstein

10:37.011 --> 10:39.253
and that English
wheelchair fella.

10:39.514 --> 10:41.301
- Cool.
<i>- He's nine years old</i>

10:41.516 --> 10:44.350
and he's in high school, so you
can't judge him like other kids.

10:44.811 --> 10:45.676
- I hear ya.
<i>- George,</i>

10:45.895 --> 10:47.136
tell him about
how he's always going

10:47.313 --> 10:50.181
on and on about
subatomic particles and such.

10:50.692 --> 10:52.274
Oh, he'll get to gabbin'
about it.

10:52.485 --> 10:55.523
We're accustomed
to his quirks and oddities.

10:55.738 --> 10:59.823
But this whole "being afraid
of solid foods" thing,

11:00.243 --> 11:01.529
it's got us thrown.

11:02.287 --> 11:04.404
Okay.
Let me just start by saying

11:04.622 --> 11:05.703
you came to the right place.

11:06.374 --> 11:08.616
<i>Sheldon and I happen
to have a lot in common.</i>

11:08.835 --> 11:10.667
I, too, was
a special little boy.

11:10.879 --> 11:11.915
In the fourth grade,
I was reading

11:12.130 --> 11:13.462
at a seventh grade level.

11:14.048 --> 11:14.879
And I don't have to tell you
where I was

11:15.091 --> 11:16.047
by the seventh grade.

11:19.179 --> 11:20.386
Tenth.

11:24.767 --> 11:26.759
I'm gonna give
the beanbag a whirl.

11:30.398 --> 11:31.479
What are y'all watching?

11:31.691 --> 11:32.772
<i>Little Rascals.</i>

11:35.486 --> 11:37.523
You know most of those kids
are dead, right?

11:37.739 --> 11:38.650
What?

11:38.865 --> 11:41.824
Alfalfa, Stymie, Buckwheat.

11:42.035 --> 11:43.321
Even Petey the dog?

11:43.536 --> 11:45.493
Oh, especially Petey the dog.

11:45.705 --> 11:47.196
Thanks for making it
depressing.

11:47.415 --> 11:48.576
You're very welcome.

11:48.791 --> 11:50.202
Y'all want to go get
some ice cream?

11:50.418 --> 11:51.204
What about dinner?

11:51.419 --> 11:53.160
What about it? Come on.

11:54.505 --> 11:55.666
Is ALF dead?

11:55.965 --> 11:58.002
No, but it's just
a matter of time.

11:58.968 --> 12:01.005
You'd be surprised how many
children have food phobias.

12:01.221 --> 12:03.929
- Is that so?
- Oh, yeah. When I was Sheldon's age,

12:04.140 --> 12:05.221
I was afraid of
that weird skin

12:05.433 --> 12:06.799
- on top of puddin'.
- Really?

12:07.018 --> 12:08.725
Me, too. You know, you put
a little Saran Wrap on...

12:08.937 --> 12:09.973
George.

12:13.024 --> 12:14.014
Sheldon?

12:14.859 --> 12:15.690
Where the hell did he go?

12:16.694 --> 12:17.650
Sheldon?

12:18.154 --> 12:19.190
Couldn't have gone far.

12:19.697 --> 12:20.483
Why not?

12:21.241 --> 12:22.231
Right on, right on.

12:25.245 --> 12:26.201
I checked the bathroom,
the stairs.

12:26.412 --> 12:27.493
He's not in the building.

12:27.705 --> 12:29.196
I'm worried.
No one's answering at home.

12:29.415 --> 12:30.622
Stay calm. We'll find him.

12:31.125 --> 12:31.740
<i>You know,</i>

12:31.960 --> 12:32.746
when I was a kid...

12:32.961 --> 12:34.202
Shut up.

12:34.921 --> 12:35.752
Well...

12:40.301 --> 12:42.759
<i>It wasn't typical
for me to wander out into</i>

12:42.971 --> 12:46.590
<i>the urban jungle on my own,
but I was on a mission.</i>

12:46.808 --> 12:50.768
<i>I had gotten my first taste
of serialized superheroes,</i>

12:50.979 --> 12:52.265
<i>and I needed more.</i>

13:00.196 --> 13:03.234
Excuse me,
do you have <i>X-Men</i> #137?

13:03.449 --> 13:06.237
I'd like to know
what happens next, please.

13:06.744 --> 13:08.701
Back bin in the corner.

13:10.290 --> 13:11.622
What are you doing here?

13:11.833 --> 13:13.165
Oh, hello, Tam.

13:13.376 --> 13:15.459
I thought you said
comic books are for children.

13:15.753 --> 13:17.665
I'm a complicated young man.

13:21.217 --> 13:22.298
I think we should
call the police.

13:22.510 --> 13:24.593
We don't need the police.
We'll find him.

13:24.804 --> 13:26.090
This is all my fault.

13:26.306 --> 13:28.423
He ran away because
we took him to a therapist.

13:29.142 --> 13:30.633
That's $15 we ain't
getting back.

13:30.852 --> 13:32.684
That's what you're
worried about?

13:33.021 --> 13:34.978
No. Course not.

13:37.525 --> 13:39.061
And Sheldon's fine.

13:39.861 --> 13:41.147
You know what he's like.

13:41.446 --> 13:42.186
If someone took him,

13:42.405 --> 13:44.067
I'm sure
they'll bring him right back.

13:55.793 --> 13:57.625
I'm enjoying this,
but I'm having trouble

13:57.837 --> 13:59.373
with the onomatopoeia.

14:01.382 --> 14:02.042
The what?

14:02.258 --> 14:03.624
The onomatopoeia.

14:03.843 --> 14:05.709
Words that imitate sounds.

14:05.928 --> 14:08.341
"Kthoom." "Snikt."

14:08.681 --> 14:09.546
<i>"Bamf."</i>

14:09.766 --> 14:11.723
Writers shouldn't
make up words.

14:12.310 --> 14:14.552
Somebody made up
"onomatopoeia."

14:17.231 --> 14:19.894
You challenge me.
I like that.

14:28.409 --> 14:30.025
Meemaw, are you gonna have
any more babies?

14:30.244 --> 14:31.826
Good Lord, no!

14:32.038 --> 14:33.654
She's too old
to have any more babies.

14:33.873 --> 14:35.830
Don't have to have 'em.
You live long enough,

14:36.042 --> 14:37.658
your hair and your teeth
start falling out,

14:37.877 --> 14:40.164
you start wetting the bed,
you get to be one.

14:40.380 --> 14:41.211
That's funny.

14:41.422 --> 14:43.129
We're gonna have to
put a diaper on you.

14:43.341 --> 14:45.424
You won't be laughing
when you're doing it.

14:45.760 --> 14:46.796
I might be.

14:50.306 --> 14:54.050
Hey, Meemaw, next to Sheldon,
who's smarter, me or Georgie?

14:54.268 --> 14:55.224
Me, of course.

14:55.520 --> 14:56.260
Why you?

14:56.479 --> 14:57.936
My head's bigger.

14:58.147 --> 14:59.604
It doesn't matter.

14:59.816 --> 15:01.853
Tonight is not about Sheldon.

15:02.568 --> 15:05.356
Yeah, right. Everything's
always about Sheldon.

15:05.571 --> 15:06.607
Yeah. Most of the time,

15:06.823 --> 15:08.610
it's like we don't even exist.

15:09.700 --> 15:12.568
I guess Sheldon does get
most of the attention.

15:12.787 --> 15:14.198
Maybe that's a good thing.

15:15.164 --> 15:16.075
How?

15:16.290 --> 15:18.202
Well, if it weren't for him,
your parents would be

15:18.418 --> 15:19.784
on <i>your</i> ass all the time.

15:20.002 --> 15:22.915
Yeah. I guess I never thought
about it that way before.

15:23.131 --> 15:26.215
You kidding me? Right now,
they would be nagging you

15:26.426 --> 15:27.883
about cleaning your room

15:28.094 --> 15:29.505
<i>and doing
your homework.</i>

15:29.720 --> 15:32.963
Instead, you're sitting
in a parking lot,

15:33.182 --> 15:35.094
eating a Blizzard for dinner.

15:35.309 --> 15:37.551
- With cookie dough in it.
<i>- Exactly.</i>

15:37.770 --> 15:41.639
While Sheldon is stuck sitting
in some boring shrink's office.

15:41.858 --> 15:44.271
Mom told me they were
taking him for a haircut.

15:45.570 --> 15:47.562
Oh. Yeah.

15:47.780 --> 15:49.066
Right.

15:49.282 --> 15:52.946
Well, when he gets home,
say his hair looks good.

16:08.551 --> 16:09.257
What?

16:10.595 --> 16:11.631
Nothing.

16:24.358 --> 16:25.269
You want one?

16:26.277 --> 16:27.108
No.

16:28.196 --> 16:29.107
Well...

16:29.322 --> 16:31.689
if you change your mind,
help yourself.

16:34.285 --> 16:36.197
<i>I didn't
have to read many comic books</i>

16:36.412 --> 16:40.326
<i>to understand that
every superhero had a weakness,</i>

16:40.541 --> 16:42.123
<i>something they had to overcome</i>

16:42.335 --> 16:45.453
<i>through an extraordinary act
of courage.</i>

16:46.589 --> 16:49.377
<i>For Cyclops,
it was the loss of Jean Grey.</i>

16:49.675 --> 16:51.758
<i>For Rogue, it was human touch.</i>

16:51.969 --> 16:54.928
<i>For me, it was food
that required chewing.</i>

16:55.139 --> 16:57.973
<i>So if I truly was a mutant,
I would have to do the same.</i>

17:11.948 --> 17:15.406
<i>On this day,
I would not be defeated.</i>

17:17.828 --> 17:19.819
<i>Because this was
the day I became...</i>

17:21.707 --> 17:23.117
<i>...The Chewer.</i>

17:24.544 --> 17:28.503
<i>Just like that,
I overcame my fear of choking.</i>

17:28.714 --> 17:31.206
<i>All that was left
was my fear of dogs,</i>

17:31.425 --> 17:33.462
<i>birds, insects, germs,</i>

17:33.678 --> 17:35.260
<i>hugging, button fly pants,</i>

17:35.471 --> 17:37.463
<i>rivers, ponds, lakes, oceans,</i>

17:37.682 --> 17:40.299
<i>estuaries, corduroy,
root vegetables,</i>

17:40.518 --> 17:42.384
<i>squeaky balloons,
tinted windows,</i>

17:42.603 --> 17:44.390
<i>take a penny, leave a penny,
fireworks,</i>

17:44.605 --> 17:46.767
<i>potbelly stoves, dust bunnies,</i>

17:46.983 --> 17:49.896
<i>that fuzz on peaches. Ugh.</i>

17:53.281 --> 17:55.819
What I find interesting
is how many supervillains

17:56.033 --> 17:58.741
Doctor Octopus,

17:58.995 --> 18:01.863
Doctor Doom, Lex Luthor,

18:02.081 --> 18:04.539
Green Goblin,
the list goes on and on.

18:04.917 --> 18:05.748
So?

18:05.960 --> 18:07.451
So if the world
doesn't respect me,

18:07.670 --> 18:08.956
I might change sides.

18:12.800 --> 18:14.007
Uh-oh.

18:14.885 --> 18:16.001
Good luck.

18:23.769 --> 18:25.761
<i>I tried
to explain to my parents</i>

18:25.980 --> 18:27.937
<i>that a mutant named Cyclops,</i>

18:28.149 --> 18:29.890
<i>who shoots laser beams
out of his eyes,</i>

18:30.109 --> 18:32.101
<i>helped me eat a licorice stick.</i>

18:32.320 --> 18:34.152
<i>Went right over their heads.</i>
