You're just a bad copy of me.

13:17.720 --> 13:20.166
Yeah, we're kind of over
the whole "bad copy" thing.

13:20.240 --> 13:23.005
It's way more accurate for us
to call you older sister.

13:23.080 --> 13:25.048
Touch me and I'll gut you!

- MRS S: I wouldn't be so sure.

13:38.680 --> 13:40.921
I don't owe you nothing!

13:41.480 --> 13:42.720
No, no.

13:42.800 --> 13:44.165
In fact, I owe you.

I'll ever get to a cure.

She's not interested in a cure.

No, she's interested
in that weapon inside you.

He was paranoid.
He didn't know who to trust.

(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)

40:06.880 --> 40:07.881
Who's that?

40:18.760 --> 40:20.000
You're...

40:21.120 --> 40:23.122

- Charlotte. Yes.

40:23.440 --> 40:25.044
And you're Rachel.

40:25.160 --> 40:29.210
(STAMMERS) Do you know where I am?

40:30.840 --> 40:32.604
She said you're going
to be my new mum.

40:34.360 --> 40:37.011

40:44.400 --> 40:45.765
Welcome home.

40:50.080 --> 40:51.445
Mother...

41:17.120 --> 41:20.363

- Mommy! Mommy,

41:31.480 --> 41:33.244
Feet of bloody ice I've got.

There's someone
who wants to meet you.

41:48.840 --> 41:49.841
Who is it?

41:51.840 --> 41:53.205
In a bit.

41:53.960 --> 41:55.405
I just want to look at you.

41:55.880 --> 41:57.450
- Yeah. Okay.
- Okay.

41:57.520 --> 41:58.521
