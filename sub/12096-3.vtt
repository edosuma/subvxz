00:04.600 --> 00:07.434
ANNOUNCER:
<i>This is the story of two sisters,</i>

00:08.080 --> 00:11.437
<i>Jessica Tate and Mary Campbell.</i>

00:11.680 --> 00:15.993
<i>Jessica lives in a neighbourhood</i>
<i>known as rich.</i>

00:16.200 --> 00:17.759
<i>Jessica likes life.</i>

00:18.000 --> 00:20.834
<i>The only thing about life</i>
<i>she would change, if she could,</i>

00:21.040 --> 00:23.509
<i>is that she would</i>
<i>set it all to music.</i>

00:24.760 --> 00:28.390
<i>The Tates have more secrets</i>
<i>than they do money.</i>

00:31.320 --> 00:34.392
<i>We're approaching</i>
<i>Mary Campbell's house.</i>

00:36.240 --> 00:37.754
<i>Mary, too, likes life.</i>

00:37.960 --> 00:41.749
<i>Unfortunately, life doesn't seem to be</i>
<i>too crazy about her.</i>

00:41.960 --> 00:44.191
<i>As you can see,</i>
<i>the Campbells don't have</i>

00:44.400 --> 00:46.756
<i>nearly as much money</i>
<i>as the Tates.</i>

00:47.600 --> 00:51.230
<i>They do, however,</i>
<i>have as many secrets.</i>

00:54.920 --> 00:58.516
<i>In last week's episode of</i> Soap,
<i>we discovered that not only Jessica</i>

00:58.720 --> 01:01.474
<i>and her daughter are having an affair</i>
<i>with Peter, the tennis pro,</i>

01:01.680 --> 01:03.990
<i>but that Peter is Burt Campbell's</i>
<i>long-lost son.</i>

01:04.200 --> 01:06.396
<i>As for Burt Campbell,</i>
<i>Mary's second husband,</i>

01:06.600 --> 01:09.752
<i>he is so overwhelmed by guilt</i>
<i>for having murdered Mary's</i>
<i>first husband,</i>

01:09.960 --> 01:11.599
<i>he can no longer</i>
<i>make love to her.</i>

01:11.800 --> 01:15.714
<i>But this is nothing, because Burt</i>
<i>doesn't know that Mary's son Danny,</i>

01:15.920 --> 01:19.436
<i>in order to leave the Mob, has to</i>
<i>kill the man who killed his father.</i>

01:19.640 --> 01:22.633
<i>Danny doesn't know that</i>
<i>that man is Burt yet.</i>

01:22.960 --> 01:26.590
<i>Mary's other son, Jodie,</i>
<i>is contemplating becoming</i>
<i>her daughter.</i>

01:26.960 --> 01:30.670
<i>Life is also not exactly a bed of roses</i>
<i>for Jessica's husband, Chester.</i>

01:30.880 --> 01:33.839
<i>His affair with his secretary, Claire,</i>
<i>has become complicated</i>

01:34.040 --> 01:36.191
<i>by the fact that</i>
<i>she is now blackmailing him.</i>

01:36.400 --> 01:40.997
<i>Confused? You won't be after</i>
<i>this week's episode of</i> Soap.

01:42.400 --> 01:44.710
<i>We begin this week's</i>
<i>episode of</i> Soap

01:44.920 --> 01:48.516
<i>shortly after Peter's arrival</i>
<i>at the Tate home.</i>

01:50.840 --> 01:52.718
I just can't believe it!

01:52.920 --> 01:54.832
I cannot believe it.

01:55.040 --> 01:57.839
I mean, it's such a small,
small world. I can't get over it.

01:58.040 --> 02:00.874
I mean, my long-lost son
from Hawaii

02:01.080 --> 02:03.356
comes to Connecticut
and winds up teaching

02:03.560 --> 02:06.234
my sister-in-law
and her daughter tennis.

02:06.440 --> 02:08.556
Bet that ain't all he teaches.

02:09.160 --> 02:11.470
And then, and this is
really incredible,

02:11.680 --> 02:13.956
my sister-in-law
and her daughter don't know

02:14.160 --> 02:15.753
they have the same
tennis teacher.

02:15.960 --> 02:18.634
Plus, which he doesn't know,
they're mother and daughter. Pfft!

02:19.360 --> 02:21.670
I'm not finished with that,
Benson.

02:24.280 --> 02:27.398
And then... And then
to top it all off,

02:27.600 --> 02:31.480
no one, but no one knows
he's my son. Pfft!

02:31.720 --> 02:33.598
So what, Burt?

02:35.720 --> 02:39.157
So it's a small, small world,
and I can't get over it, can you?

02:39.360 --> 02:40.953
Yes.

02:41.600 --> 02:45.037
Colonel, where's
General Eisenhower?
Wasn't he invited?

02:45.720 --> 02:47.359
Where in the world is Jessica?

02:47.560 --> 02:50.837
In my kitchen, and I wish she
would get the hell out of there.

02:52.080 --> 02:54.356
I'll get her, Chester.
Eat your dinner.

02:54.720 --> 02:57.110
Benson, I am not finished.

02:59.000 --> 03:05.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:10.280 --> 03:13.114
Jessica?
Oh, hello, Mary,

03:13.360 --> 03:14.589
could I get you something?

03:14.800 --> 03:16.837
Jessie, you can't hide
in the kitchen all night.

03:17.040 --> 03:19.111
Hide? Who's hiding?

03:19.320 --> 03:21.835
I am helping Benson
make a soufflé for dessert.

03:22.040 --> 03:25.511
Uh-uh, uh-uh. Forget it.
I ain't making no soufflé.

03:25.720 --> 03:28.872
I told you I ain't making
no soufflé for these animals.

03:29.080 --> 03:33.438
The way they eat, I ought to just
shove the food in under the door.

03:33.960 --> 03:36.429
And you see, for a soufflé,
of course, you have to beat

03:36.640 --> 03:38.438
the egg whites and the
egg yolks separately,

03:38.640 --> 03:40.233
Therefore, you need
two people, Mary.

03:40.440 --> 03:43.601
I mean, one to beat the whites
and one to beat the yolks.
I'm beating the whites.

03:43.800 --> 03:48.352
Oh, yeah? Well, there's
a whole table of them in there
I'd like to help you with.

03:50.720 --> 03:52.916
Jessie, I know.

03:53.280 --> 03:55.954
And if you don't come out,
everyone's going to be suspicious.

03:56.160 --> 03:58.914
Oh, Mary, I'm so
ashamed I could die.

03:59.160 --> 04:02.756
Do you realise what I've done?
I've had an affair with my nephew.

04:02.960 --> 04:05.270
I think that's against the law.

04:05.480 --> 04:06.834
He's not your nephew.

04:07.040 --> 04:12.115
I mean, I just got used to adultery
and now I have to get used to, uh...

04:12.840 --> 04:14.638
Incest.

04:16.160 --> 04:19.551
Benson, he is not related to us.
He is my stepson.

04:21.680 --> 04:23.160
Oh, Mary,

04:23.800 --> 04:27.396
I've never done this
before, ever. I...

04:28.000 --> 04:30.754
See, what it was, was...

04:30.960 --> 04:32.952
I was lonely.

04:33.160 --> 04:37.712
I mean, uh, Chester's never here,
and then the kids are never here,

04:37.920 --> 04:43.075
and I've done all the clever things
I could with shelving paper, and, uh...

04:44.680 --> 04:49.709
So, Mary, I did that.

04:49.920 --> 04:52.640
But I'm never gonna
do it again, Mary. Ever.

04:52.920 --> 04:55.230
Okay, Jessie. Okay.

04:55.440 --> 04:56.476
Come on out, now.

04:56.680 --> 04:59.718
If you stay in here,
Chester will become suspicious.

04:59.920 --> 05:02.754
Oh, my God! Chester.
I have to tell him.

05:02.960 --> 05:04.792
Mary, I have to tell
Chester what I've done.

05:05.000 --> 05:07.469
Are you crazy?
No, it's the right thing to do.

05:07.680 --> 05:09.751
It's the stupid thing to do.

05:10.800 --> 05:12.154
I'm going to tell him.

05:12.360 --> 05:14.920
All right, Jessie.
I was never gonna tell you this,

05:15.200 --> 05:18.591
but poor, sweet Chester has been...
Hm?

05:19.800 --> 05:23.237
How do I put this?
Jumping on anything that breathes?

05:26.200 --> 05:27.680
[LAUGHS]

05:29.560 --> 05:33.110
I wasn't gonna put it
quite that way.

05:33.600 --> 05:36.035
Oh, sweet, adorable Mary.

05:36.240 --> 05:38.550
I mean, you'd just do
anything to keep me
from telling him.

05:38.760 --> 05:41.798
Even to making up that
outrageous lie about Chester.

05:42.000 --> 05:43.673
Hi, Ma. Hi, Aunt Mary.
JESSICA: Oh, hello darling.

05:43.880 --> 05:45.600
Can I have the keys
to the car? It's locked.

05:45.800 --> 05:46.950
But you don't drive, dear.

05:47.160 --> 05:50.232
I don't want them for driving.
I want them for parking.

05:50.440 --> 05:52.591
The car is parked already.

05:52.800 --> 05:55.554
Look, Ma. Can I just
have the keys?

05:55.760 --> 05:58.480
I got my date outside
and we just want to sit in it.

05:58.680 --> 06:00.637
But, dear,
you can invite her in.

06:00.840 --> 06:02.797
I mean, she doesn't
have to sit in the car.

06:03.400 --> 06:05.232
She likes sitting in cars.

06:06.640 --> 06:09.678
Ma, we're just gonna listen
to the tape deck and talk.
I promise.

06:09.880 --> 06:12.873
Oh, well, all right.
Here you are.

06:13.080 --> 06:15.356
Thanks, Ma. Bye, Aunt Mary.
MARY: Bye.

06:15.560 --> 06:19.679
Ah, children. I mean,
you work, work, work to
give them a beautiful house,

06:19.880 --> 06:22.076
and then they just
want to sit in the car.

06:22.840 --> 06:25.594
Jessica?
Oh. Mary.

06:25.800 --> 06:27.792
Well, this is a fine how-do-you-do.

06:28.000 --> 06:30.595
You invite your insane family
over for dinner,

06:30.800 --> 06:32.280
and I'm the one
who's stuck with them.

06:32.440 --> 06:37.231
Now, Jessica, either you get out
of this kitchen and come inside,
or I am sending everyone home.

06:37.440 --> 06:38.715
Send them home.

06:39.960 --> 06:41.917
Shut up, Benson.

06:42.640 --> 06:44.552
I will, when you send them home.

06:45.920 --> 06:47.673
Well, Jessica?

06:47.960 --> 06:50.111
What were the choices again?

06:51.280 --> 06:52.839
Come on, Jessica.

06:54.640 --> 06:57.758
It's a small, small world
and I can't get over it.

06:57.960 --> 06:59.314
Why don't you try, Burt?

06:59.520 --> 07:01.079
[LAUGHS]

07:01.280 --> 07:03.961
You know, it's funny.
I've been thinking about
taking tennis lessons.

07:04.040 --> 07:07.636
Get your hands off
my son, you fruit.

07:07.840 --> 07:10.799
My brother is not a fruit!

07:11.000 --> 07:13.276
JESSICA:
Oh, Mary!

07:14.080 --> 07:17.391
Boys! Stop it! That's enough.
JESSICA: Mary!

07:19.440 --> 07:23.559
I am not cleaning this.
Ain't no way I'm gonna
clean this.

07:24.040 --> 07:26.999
Burt, stop this, you idiot! Oh!

07:30.320 --> 07:33.233
Medic, medic! I've been shot.

07:35.960 --> 07:38.316
Drop that, you thug.

07:40.280 --> 07:42.840
Good night, Uncle Chester.
I had a wonderful time.

07:43.440 --> 07:46.831
I've had it. I've had it
with all of you. You are
never coming here again!

07:47.040 --> 07:49.350
Terrific. Nothing could
suit me better.

07:49.640 --> 07:50.790
Slobs.

07:51.000 --> 07:53.276
Slobs? Slobs? Heh-heh-heh.

07:53.800 --> 07:55.393
I'm a slob? Look at you.

07:55.600 --> 07:58.274
You've got cranberry sauce
all over your shirt.

07:59.280 --> 08:00.634
Out! Out!

08:01.040 --> 08:02.997
[♪♪♪]

08:13.520 --> 08:14.920
Burt, are you asleep?

08:15.360 --> 08:18.512
Are you kidding? With that
racket going on next door?

08:19.080 --> 08:21.390
Burt, we don't even try anymore.

08:21.600 --> 08:22.716
Why don't we try?

08:22.920 --> 08:24.832
1:00 in the morning
and that's going on.

08:25.040 --> 08:26.838
There's nothing going on
next door, Burt.

08:27.040 --> 08:29.839
What, are you joking? You don't
hear that? Farkus and his wife?

08:30.040 --> 08:32.350
Is it that you're not
attracted to me? Is that it?

08:32.559 --> 08:33.880
I think he hit her.

08:34.080 --> 08:36.720
There's nothing
going on next door, Burt.

08:36.919 --> 08:39.879
Did you hear that smack?
Didn't that smack sound
just like a hit?

08:40.080 --> 08:41.753
I didn't hear a hit, Burt.

08:41.960 --> 08:44.998
I didn't hear a smack
and I didn't hear a hit.

08:45.480 --> 08:47.437
[MOUTHING]

08:49.520 --> 08:51.876
What?
I was testing. You didn't hear that?

08:52.080 --> 08:53.560
Burt...
Mary, Mary, I think you should

08:53.760 --> 08:57.231
have your ears checked.
It's probably just wax, but I would
have them checked anyway.

08:57.440 --> 09:00.911
Burt, what is it? Is it that
you're not attracted to me?

09:01.520 --> 09:03.876
No. It's a temporary thing.
It'll go away.

09:04.080 --> 09:05.639
It happens to men.

09:05.960 --> 09:07.599
It's been six months.

09:07.800 --> 09:11.396
Oh, wonderful, wonderful.
Put pressure on me, Mary,
it'll never happen.

09:11.600 --> 09:14.911
Pressure? We've never even
talked about it.

09:15.280 --> 09:17.840
I just don't think we can
let this go on forever.

09:18.040 --> 09:19.679
Oh, time.
Now we have time limits?

09:19.880 --> 09:22.121
If there's one thing that
doesn't help, it's time limits.

09:22.320 --> 09:24.437
Darling, maybe you
ought to see a psychiatrist.

09:24.640 --> 09:26.960
Now I'm crazy, right?
All of a sudden,
I'm some kind of nut.

09:27.160 --> 09:30.119
No, darling, I just thought maybe
it might help to talk to someone...

09:30.320 --> 09:34.678
Did you hear them? Quiet.
Human beings are trying
to sleep up here!

09:35.200 --> 09:37.510
Burt, are you having an affair?

09:39.960 --> 09:43.397
God, Mary, no!
Because it's normal, darling.

09:43.600 --> 09:47.753
A chance encounter,
a few glorious stolen moments,

09:47.960 --> 09:50.600
and sometimes,
life can be all the richer for it.

09:50.800 --> 09:53.520
So if you're having an affair,
you can tell me.

09:53.720 --> 09:56.997
I'll understand.
Mary, I swear it. There's no one.

09:57.560 --> 10:01.031
Good. Because if you were,
I'd rip your heart out.

10:01.800 --> 10:04.031
Mary, how could you think that,
even for a minute?

10:04.240 --> 10:07.278
Burt, I bought something today.

10:07.480 --> 10:10.518
I think it might help. Now...

10:11.280 --> 10:13.556
Don't let the title
frighten you.

10:19.640 --> 10:21.757
<i>The Cookbook of Sex?</i>

10:21.960 --> 10:23.917
I know.
I wish they hadn't called it that.

10:24.120 --> 10:28.512
But, look, it's written by an M.D.
Recipes? He gives recipes?

10:28.720 --> 10:30.712
Mary, you actually
paid money for this?

10:30.920 --> 10:32.559
Well, yes.

10:32.760 --> 10:34.399
I mean, I've tried everything.

10:34.600 --> 10:36.831
I've tried short nightgowns,
long nightgowns,

10:37.040 --> 10:38.918
new nightgowns, no nightgowns.

10:39.200 --> 10:42.432
I have powdered myself,
perfumed myself.

10:42.640 --> 10:45.474
Bees are attracted to me
and you're not.

10:46.240 --> 10:48.197
Mary, Mary, don't cry.

10:48.400 --> 10:51.154
Please, honey, don't cry.
Please, don't cry.

10:51.360 --> 10:52.840
I just feel awful.

10:53.040 --> 10:55.600
Sweetheart, it's not you,
I swear it. I...

10:55.800 --> 10:57.439
Look, I...

10:57.640 --> 10:58.710
Bzz. Bzz.

10:58.920 --> 11:01.071
I love you,
and you're all I want.

11:01.280 --> 11:03.112
I promise you,
if things don't change,

11:03.320 --> 11:07.030
I'll get some help.
I promise. Okay?

11:07.240 --> 11:08.515
Bzz.

11:09.680 --> 11:11.433
[BOTH CHUCKLING]

11:14.720 --> 11:17.235
Try and get some sleep, Mary.

11:23.160 --> 11:25.038
Look at that.

11:25.240 --> 11:27.835
I mean, that's a total
impossibility.

11:29.800 --> 11:32.759
I mean, the Flying Wallendas,
at the height of their career,

11:32.960 --> 11:34.917

calling me at home?

11:46.960 --> 11:49.475
For crying out loud, Claire,
it's 1:00 in the morning.

11:49.680 --> 11:51.990
I can't come over.

11:52.200 --> 11:55.716
All right, Claire.
All right. I'll come over.

11:55.920 --> 11:57.991
I'll think of a way. Goodbye.

12:00.000 --> 12:01.673
Who's laughing?

12:03.160 --> 12:05.197
Benson, is that you laughing?

12:06.160 --> 12:07.160
Oh!

12:07.320 --> 12:10.358
What?
I was just surprised to see you.

12:11.600 --> 12:12.920
I live here.

12:13.520 --> 12:15.830
No, I mean still up.

12:16.040 --> 12:18.680
I thought maybe
you had gone to sleep by now.

12:19.760 --> 12:21.353
I had a business call.

12:22.960 --> 12:26.237
Chester, I have a confession
to make. I, uh...

12:26.440 --> 12:28.432
Chester, please sit down.

12:28.640 --> 12:30.438
What is it, Jessica?

12:30.960 --> 12:34.317
Chester, when people
have been married a long time,

12:34.520 --> 12:36.273
they spend a lot of time
together,

12:36.480 --> 12:38.360
and so then they get
kind of used to each other.

12:38.440 --> 12:41.240
And then, of course, on the other
hand, they spend a lot of time apart,

12:41.320 --> 12:43.198
and so they don't see
each other very much.

12:43.720 --> 12:45.837
So sometimes
they tend to get lonely,

12:46.040 --> 12:48.794
and sometimes, Chester,
despite themselves,

12:49.000 --> 12:51.640
they seek some
little comfort elsewhere.

12:52.480 --> 12:55.314
And so, Chester,
what I'm trying to say is that

12:55.520 --> 12:59.196
sometimes home cooking is boring,
and sometimes the kitchen is closed.

12:59.400 --> 13:03.076
And so, sometimes
one goes out to eat.

13:03.960 --> 13:06.759
Jessica!
Oh, Chester.

13:06.960 --> 13:08.519
Jessie!

13:08.720 --> 13:11.918
Oh, dear God, Jessica!
You're not saying...

13:12.120 --> 13:13.120
I am.

13:13.320 --> 13:16.119
After all these years,
I thought I knew you.

13:16.320 --> 13:18.880
I know, Chester, I know.
How could you?

13:19.080 --> 13:21.754
I don't know, Chester.
I don't know.

13:23.280 --> 13:26.352
How could you?
How could you?
Even for a minute.

13:26.560 --> 13:28.153
Oh, I'm sorry, Chester.

13:28.360 --> 13:32.673
How could you think,
even for a second,
that I would be unfaithful?

13:33.400 --> 13:34.834
Huh?

13:35.360 --> 13:37.920
Do you think our marriage
means nothing to me, Jessica?

13:38.120 --> 13:39.873
Do you think I took
those vows lightly?

13:40.080 --> 13:43.152
I don't believe this.
To accuse me of...

13:43.360 --> 13:45.477
No, no, no, Chester.
I didn't accuse you.

13:45.720 --> 13:47.677
Please, Jessica,
you did accuse me.

13:47.880 --> 13:50.759
No, Chester, I, uh...
Unfaithful!

13:50.960 --> 13:53.475

right side of my body

as looked at another woman.

May my postnasal drip
back up and drown my brain

unfaithful to you.

14:12.000 --> 14:15.038
Chester, where are you going?

Yeah, me too.

You see, oddly enough,
the thing is, I don't actually hate you.

15:11.600 --> 15:14.115
I'm not too crazy about you,
but I don't hate you.

15:14.320 --> 15:15.320
It's not even dislike.

15:15.480 --> 15:18.560
I don't dislike you.
Not that I like you, don't get
me wrong, I don't like you.

15:18.720 --> 15:22.396
But I probably could like you
if we didn't hate each other so much.

15:22.600 --> 15:25.752
The thing is,
I don't know why you hate me.

15:26.160 --> 15:27.992
You know something,
neither do I.

15:28.200 --> 15:30.157
I mean, I've thought
about it a lot too.

15:30.400 --> 15:33.552
I've tried coming up with reasons,
but there aren't any.

15:33.760 --> 15:36.719
I just look at you
and I hate your guts.

15:36.920 --> 15:39.435
Yeah, well,
I can understand that.

15:39.680 --> 15:42.673
But you know something?
You've never really done anything.

Danny, it's okay.
Don't worry about it.

the fact that I hate you personally.

I don't. I don't, really.
