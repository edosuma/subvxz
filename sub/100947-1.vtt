01:32.635 --> 01:34.835
Miss Mitchell?

01:44.155 --> 01:47.495
I expect an answer to my
question, Miss Mitchell.

01:47.565 --> 01:49.835
If you'd care to join us.

01:53.135 --> 01:56.115
Is English your first language?

01:59.885 --> 02:02.795
Since Miss Mitchell
seems to be carrying on

02:02.855 --> 02:06.035
a parallel seminar
in a different language,

02:06.095 --> 02:10.505
perhaps someone else would be
kind enough to answer my question?

02:11.975 --> 02:16.585
Dante looks into
the face of God and says...

02:16.655 --> 02:20.625
All'alta fantasia
qui manco possa.

02:20.695 --> 02:22.965
Correct, Miss Peterson.

02:31.315 --> 02:34.585
All'alta...

02:34.655 --> 02:36.825
fantasia...

02:36.895 --> 02:41.535
qui... manco... possa.

02:48.045 --> 02:51.285
After the Tuscan Guelphs
defeated the Ghibellines

02:51.355 --> 02:55.635
in 1289 at the Battle
of Campaldino and Vicopisano...

02:55.695 --> 02:57.865
Something funny, Miss Mitchell?

03:00.445 --> 03:02.915
It was my fault,
Professor Emerson.

03:02.975 --> 03:05.485
I was asking
what page we were on.

03:05.545 --> 03:10.295
Hardly an appropriate question
from a doctoral student, Paul.

03:10.355 --> 03:12.795
We began with the first canto.

03:12.865 --> 03:16.435
I trust you can find it
without her help.

03:18.545 --> 03:21.515
And Miss Mitchell?

03:21.585 --> 03:24.925
See me in my office after class.

03:41.625 --> 03:44.765
Sorry about that.

03:44.825 --> 03:47.705
I'm, uh, Paul Norris.

03:47.765 --> 03:50.075
I'm Julia Mitchell.

03:50.135 --> 03:51.745
I'm sorry the Professor
was such a prick.

03:51.775 --> 03:53.885
I don't know what's eating him.

03:55.215 --> 03:56.615
You're new?

03:56.685 --> 03:59.085
I just arrived from
Saint Joseph's University.

03:59.155 --> 04:01.465
And you're here
for your Master's?

04:01.525 --> 04:03.365
Yes. It probably
doesn't seem like it.

04:03.435 --> 04:06.675
I'm supposed to be studying
to be a Dante specialist

04:08.475 --> 04:10.215
So you're here for Emerson?

04:10.275 --> 04:12.815
He's, uh, difficult
to work with.

04:12.885 --> 04:15.425
I'm writing
my dissertation with him.

04:15.485 --> 04:17.425
And there's also
Christa Peterson.

04:17.495 --> 04:18.495
Christa?

04:18.565 --> 04:20.035
She's his other PhD student,

04:20.095 --> 04:22.605
but her goal is to be
the future Mrs. Emerson.

04:22.675 --> 04:25.945
She just started the program and
she's already baking him cookies.

04:26.015 --> 04:29.165
She doesn't seem to be aware of the
University's strict non-fraternization policy.

04:29.185 --> 04:33.025
Anyway, you better go.
Emerson hates waiting.

04:33.865 --> 04:36.695
It's down here, take a left.

04:36.765 --> 04:39.475
It's the corner office.

04:39.535 --> 04:41.275
Good Luck.

04:56.575 --> 04:58.745
I'm sorry I
didn't call you back.

04:58.805 --> 05:01.115
I was in my seminar.

05:02.445 --> 05:04.585
It's the first lecture
of the year, asshole,

05:04.655 --> 05:08.125
and the last time I talked to
her, she said she was fine.

05:10.435 --> 05:12.635
Of course I wanted to be there.

05:12.705 --> 05:15.705
I loved her, too.

05:15.775 --> 05:17.485
I don't know what time
because I don't know

05:17.545 --> 05:20.985
what kind of flight I can get,
but I'll be there.

05:21.055 --> 05:23.225
Just...

05:23.295 --> 05:25.025
Just tell them I'm sorry.

05:25.095 --> 05:28.165
I'm so sorry.

05:48.205 --> 05:52.145
"I'm Sorry.
Julia Mitchell."

06:16.835 --> 06:18.535
Hey, Dad.

06:18.605 --> 06:21.645
Those Canadians
treating you right?

06:21.705 --> 06:24.715
Yes, they're all pretty nice.

06:27.625 --> 06:29.285
Is everything okay?

06:30.665 --> 06:32.395
Grace Clark died earlier today.

06:34.265 --> 06:35.805
Did you hear what I said?

06:35.875 --> 06:39.745
Um...

06:39.815 --> 06:41.945
yes, I heard.

06:42.015 --> 06:43.225
I knew you'd take the news hard.

06:43.255 --> 06:45.485
She was like a mother to you,

06:45.555 --> 06:49.765
and you and her daughter Rachel were
such good friend's in high school.

06:49.835 --> 06:51.705
Have you heard from her?

06:53.305 --> 06:57.685
Um... no, I haven't.

06:57.745 --> 07:01.155
I'm not even sure when they
found out Grace was sick again.

07:01.225 --> 07:03.495
I was over to
their house earlier.

07:03.555 --> 07:05.365
Gabriel wasn't there.

07:05.425 --> 07:09.235
Which has caused...
quite a problem.

07:09.305 --> 07:11.405
Son of a bitch.

07:11.475 --> 07:12.945
Are you sending flowers?

07:13.015 --> 07:14.845
I guess, I'm not good
at that sort of thing,

07:14.915 --> 07:16.755
but I could ask Deb
if she would help.

07:16.815 --> 07:21.325
Ask her to send
something from me.

07:21.395 --> 07:25.005
Grace loved gardenias.

07:25.065 --> 07:27.175
Get Deb to sign the card.

07:27.245 --> 07:30.145
Will do.
Do you need any money?

07:30.215 --> 07:31.285
I'm fine.

07:31.345 --> 07:35.225
I'm sorry about Harvard.
Maybe next year.

07:35.285 --> 07:37.565
Maybe.

07:37.625 --> 07:40.265
Talk to you later, Dad.

08:00.875 --> 08:03.075
"Dear Rachel...

08:03.145 --> 08:08.925
I'm so sorry to hear
about Grace. I'm...

08:41.085 --> 08:42.895
Frightened Rabbit.

08:42.955 --> 08:44.895
Paul, hi.

08:44.965 --> 08:46.395
How was your meeting
with Emerson?

08:46.465 --> 08:48.335
I didn't go.

08:48.405 --> 08:50.845
That's...

08:50.905 --> 08:52.675
not good.

08:52.745 --> 08:54.415
His office door was closed.

08:54.485 --> 08:57.185
I think he was on the phone.
I left a note.

08:57.255 --> 08:59.155
Let's hope that's
what was going on.

08:59.225 --> 09:01.865
Otherwise, I'd say you just took
your life into your own hands.

09:03.435 --> 09:06.175
Let me know if there's any fallout,
and I'll see what I can do.

09:23.375 --> 09:25.045
Oh, my God.

09:26.145 --> 09:29.415
Excuse me Miss Mitchell,
can you come here for a minute?

09:29.485 --> 09:31.285
Yes, Mrs. Jenkins.

09:31.355 --> 09:34.895
Have you had some sort of
problem with Professor Emerson?

09:34.965 --> 09:37.705
Um, I don't think so.

09:37.765 --> 09:40.035
I received two urgent e-mails

09:40.105 --> 09:42.805
asking me to set up an appointment
to see him when he returns.

09:42.875 --> 09:45.345
Professors normally prefer to
schedule their own appointments,

09:45.415 --> 09:47.485
but he insisted I schedule it

09:47.555 --> 09:50.125
and have it documented
in your file.

09:50.195 --> 09:51.695
He said it was serious.

09:51.765 --> 09:54.605
Can you meet him at 4pm
tomorrow in his office?

11:45.025 --> 11:47.525
Hey, Julia.

11:47.595 --> 11:50.065
Wanna go for coffee some time?

11:52.065 --> 11:53.935
Um, yes, sure.

11:54.005 --> 11:56.415
It'd be easier
if I had your number.

12:01.255 --> 12:04.025
Now, Miss Mitchell.

12:05.665 --> 12:07.505
Give him hell, Rabbit.

12:19.225 --> 12:21.195
Please be seated, Miss Mitchell.

12:32.115 --> 12:33.755
Move the chair.

12:33.815 --> 12:36.755
I won't crane my neck
in order to see you.

12:50.215 --> 12:53.055
Are you a comedian,
Miss Mitchell?

12:55.695 --> 12:59.905
I expect an answer when I ask
a question, Miss Mitchell.

12:59.975 --> 13:02.345
Surely, you've learned
your lesson by now?

13:05.345 --> 13:08.055
Perhaps you're not too bright.

13:12.225 --> 13:14.965
I beg your pardon,
Dr. Emerson?

13:15.035 --> 13:18.075
It's Professor Emerson.

13:18.145 --> 13:22.415
Even chiropractors and podiatrists
refer to themselves as doctors.

13:22.485 --> 13:26.595
Would you stop fussing with that
ridiculous abomination of a bag

13:26.655 --> 13:30.065
and sit in a chair
like a human being?

13:32.335 --> 13:35.305
I'm sure you thought
this was funny.

13:40.085 --> 13:42.225
I can explain...

13:42.285 --> 13:44.125
I'm not interested
in your excuses.

13:44.195 --> 13:46.765
I asked you to come
to the last appointment.

13:46.835 --> 13:48.535
You didn't, did you?

13:48.605 --> 13:51.905
You were on the phone
and the door was closed...

13:51.975 --> 13:53.445
It wasn't closed.

13:53.515 --> 13:56.455
I suppose this was meant
to be funny too?

14:00.925 --> 14:04.335
It's not what you think.
I wanted to say I was sorry,

14:04.405 --> 14:05.475
and it was
for your family, who I...

14:05.505 --> 14:07.375
Leave my family out of it!

14:16.655 --> 14:20.335
I see that you came here on
scholarship to study Dante.

14:20.395 --> 14:23.275
I'm the only professor
in this department

14:23.335 --> 14:25.345
who is supervising theses
in that field,

14:25.405 --> 14:27.145
and since this...

14:27.215 --> 14:29.645
is not going to work,

14:29.715 --> 14:31.425
you'll have to
change your topic.

14:31.485 --> 14:34.495
Find another supervisor
or transfer departments,

14:34.565 --> 14:36.265
or better yet, university.

14:36.335 --> 14:39.735
I'll inform the director of my
decision, effective immediately.

14:40.975 --> 14:43.215
Now if you'll excuse me.

14:46.415 --> 14:48.085
That is all, Miss Mitchell.

16:37.005 --> 16:39.245
You'll catch pneumonia and die.

16:40.445 --> 16:42.015
Get in.

16:47.595 --> 16:49.995
Thank you very much.

16:50.065 --> 16:52.065
Where do you live?

16:52.135 --> 16:54.505
45 Madison.
It's just up...

16:54.575 --> 16:56.615
I know where Madison is.

17:45.445 --> 17:47.545
Wait.

18:21.785 --> 18:22.915
Thank you.

18:22.985 --> 18:25.955
I'll walk you in.
One can't be too careful.

18:53.445 --> 18:55.645
Would you like a tea?

19:07.275 --> 19:09.875
May I take your coat, Professor?

19:11.315 --> 19:12.985
Where would you put it?

19:14.685 --> 19:16.485
That was rude. Uh...

19:17.965 --> 19:19.725
Forgive me.

19:40.975 --> 19:43.715
Would you like
English Breakfast or Lady Grey?

19:43.775 --> 19:46.415
English breakfast.

20:00.045 --> 20:03.785
You should change into
some dry clothes.

21:12.355 --> 21:14.325
Why do you live here?

21:15.195 --> 21:17.935
It's a quiet street
in a nice neighborhood.

21:17.995 --> 21:20.405
I needed to be able
to walk to school.

21:20.475 --> 21:24.375
This was one of the nicer
apartments I looked at.

21:24.445 --> 21:27.715
Why didn't you move into
the graduate student residence?

21:27.785 --> 21:30.795
I was expecting to go to
a different university,

21:30.855 --> 21:33.665
but that didn't work out.

21:36.665 --> 21:39.245
Where were you going to go?

21:44.355 --> 21:45.355
Miss Mitchell?

21:45.425 --> 21:47.325
Harvard.

21:47.395 --> 21:49.895
Harvard?

21:49.965 --> 21:52.205
What the hell
are you doing here then?

21:55.345 --> 21:58.245
My father couldn't afford
the parental contribution.

21:58.315 --> 22:01.015
The fellowship they offered
wasn't enough,

22:01.085 --> 22:04.355
and the living expenses
in Cambridge was than Toronto.

22:04.425 --> 22:08.235
I have thousands of dollars
in student loans.

22:08.305 --> 22:13.775
I decided not to add to them.
That's why I'm here.

22:16.545 --> 22:20.955
That wasn't in the file
Mrs. Jenkins gave me.

22:21.025 --> 22:23.735
You should have said something.

22:31.715 --> 22:34.925
This is a terrible
place to live.

22:34.985 --> 22:37.325
There isn't even
a proper kitchen.

22:37.395 --> 22:38.895
What do you eat here?

22:38.965 --> 22:42.535
I cook soup and couscous
on the hot plate.

22:42.605 --> 22:43.805
Couscous is very nutritious.

22:43.875 --> 22:45.805
You can't live off of that.

22:45.875 --> 22:48.315
A dog eats better.

22:52.455 --> 22:54.825
Forgive me. Um...

22:56.095 --> 22:58.265
I don't know what's
gotten into me.

23:03.445 --> 23:05.945
You just lost your mom.

23:16.235 --> 23:18.645
I can't be here.

23:18.705 --> 23:20.375
I need to go.

23:40.285 --> 23:43.325
When was the last time
you had steak?

23:43.385 --> 23:46.695
Uh, it's been a while.

23:46.765 --> 23:48.235
I'm starving,

23:48.305 --> 23:50.035
and you're
joining me for dinner.

23:50.105 --> 23:54.885
Are you sure Professor?
I thought this...

23:54.945 --> 23:56.815
wasn't going to work.

23:56.885 --> 23:59.885
Never mind that now.
Um...

23:59.955 --> 24:01.625
Except...

24:02.525 --> 24:04.335
I could change.

24:05.965 --> 24:07.935
But I have one condition.

24:09.675 --> 24:11.415
Let's hear it.

24:11.475 --> 24:14.055
Tell me why,

24:14.115 --> 24:16.955
after everything
you've said to me,

24:17.025 --> 24:19.165
should I join you?

24:25.505 --> 24:27.915
Because Emerson is an ass.

24:31.015 --> 24:33.995
But at least now he knows it.

24:36.695 --> 24:39.135
I'll change.

26:39.805 --> 26:41.475
Vanilla.

26:44.085 --> 26:45.755
What?

26:48.295 --> 26:50.065
Nothing.

26:56.845 --> 26:58.515
May I?

27:29.145 --> 27:31.615
Thank you.

27:47.545 --> 27:51.255
Ah, Professore Emerson.
Cosi bello vederti.

27:51.315 --> 27:53.955
Antonio. E 'bello vederti anche tu.
Stai guardando bene.

27:54.025 --> 27:56.925
Grazie, grazie.
And who is this lovely lady?

27:56.995 --> 28:00.405
Antonio, this
is Julianne Mitchell.

28:00.465 --> 28:01.475
Julia.

28:01.505 --> 28:03.475
Semplicemente sensazionale.

28:03.545 --> 28:06.145
I tuoi occhi sono come
piccole nocciole

28:06.215 --> 28:08.625
al cioccolato.
Bellissima.

28:08.685 --> 28:10.485
Grazie.
Sei troppo gentile.

28:10.555 --> 28:13.865
Questo ristorante è incantevole.

28:17.675 --> 28:19.975
Please, this way.

28:28.995 --> 28:32.305
Signorina.

28:32.365 --> 28:35.445
And I have a beautiful
bottle of wine

28:35.505 --> 28:37.745
from my family's
vineyard in Tuscany.

28:37.815 --> 28:39.025
Please don't go to any trouble.

28:39.045 --> 28:41.555
No trouble.
E 'fatto.

28:43.555 --> 28:47.365
How did you come by
your Tuscan accent?

28:47.435 --> 28:50.035
I spent my junior year
in Florence.

28:50.105 --> 28:52.405
Impressive for only
a year abroad.

28:52.475 --> 28:56.415
I started studying Italian
when I was seventeen.

29:05.665 --> 29:07.535
I could order for you.

29:08.545 --> 29:11.015
Thank you, Professor Emerson.

29:12.145 --> 29:15.185
Best not to call me
"Professor" in public.

29:16.025 --> 29:18.595
Mr. Emerson will suffice.

29:23.005 --> 29:25.045
Signorina.

29:58.435 --> 30:00.005
Perfezione.

30:10.195 --> 30:13.835
Are we ready to order?

30:13.905 --> 30:18.145
Two of your finest and largest
filet mignons. Medium rare.

30:18.215 --> 30:19.345
No, that's too much.

30:19.415 --> 30:21.255
You can take home the leftovers.

30:21.315 --> 30:24.195
I'm sure your couscous
won't mind.

30:26.625 --> 30:29.435
And then I will bring
a beautiful tiramisu,

30:29.505 --> 30:32.945
and an affogato with vanilla bean gelato.
Complimenti.

30:33.005 --> 30:36.145
Grazie. Sei troppo gentile.

30:45.605 --> 30:48.605
Why did you start
studying Italian?

30:54.045 --> 30:57.795
It's a simple question,
is it not?

30:58.765 --> 31:00.795
Um...

31:00.865 --> 31:04.935
I became interested
in Italian literature.

31:05.005 --> 31:07.515
In Dante and Beatrice.

31:07.575 --> 31:11.615
That's an unusual interest
for a teenager.

31:15.695 --> 31:19.565
I had a friend who
introduced me to them.

31:28.555 --> 31:30.655
Antonio is taken with you.

31:30.715 --> 31:33.665
He's never offered me
an affogato on the house.

31:33.725 --> 31:36.405
I like him.

31:36.465 --> 31:38.605
He's kind.

31:38.675 --> 31:41.975
You blossom under kindness,
don't you?

31:42.045 --> 31:43.715
Like a rose.

32:57.865 --> 32:59.535
The fuck?

33:01.275 --> 33:04.675
Julia Mitchell?
Is that you?

33:04.745 --> 33:06.515
Rachel?

33:12.495 --> 33:14.435
I can't believe it's you.

33:14.495 --> 33:16.735
You, too.
Rachel, I'm so sorry.

33:16.805 --> 33:19.505
I'm sorry for everything.
About your mom and...

33:19.575 --> 33:21.045
everything.

33:21.115 --> 33:22.515
I got your email,

33:22.585 --> 33:25.785
and the gardenias you sent
were so beautiful.

33:25.855 --> 33:28.825
You remembered
they were her favorite.

33:28.895 --> 33:29.925
How's your dad?

33:29.995 --> 33:33.405
He's... so lost.

33:33.465 --> 33:35.475
We all are.
That's why I'm here.

33:35.545 --> 33:37.515
Why didn't you
tell me you were here?

33:37.575 --> 33:39.785
I wasn't sure I'd be staying.

33:39.845 --> 33:42.825
The first couple of weeks
have been really, um, rough.

33:43.785 --> 33:45.495
Rachel, we need to go.

33:45.565 --> 33:49.565
I'm making a home cooked meal,
and you're coming over.

33:49.635 --> 33:52.275
I'm sure Miss Mitchell
has other plans.

33:52.345 --> 33:57.485
Miss Mitchell? Julia's been my
best friend since high school.

33:58.855 --> 33:59.755
What?

33:59.825 --> 34:02.895
I forgot you two never met.

34:02.965 --> 34:05.935
Regardless, your attitude
is a little bit much.

34:06.005 --> 34:09.175
Do you wanna do me a favor and
remove the pole from your keister?

34:09.245 --> 34:11.575
Why don't we meet for lunch instead?
I'm sure The Pro...

34:11.645 --> 34:14.915
Your brother wants you
all to himself.

34:14.985 --> 34:17.325
He's Gabriel.

34:17.385 --> 34:20.425
What is going on
between you two?

34:20.495 --> 34:22.705
Rachel, she's my student.
There are rules.

34:22.765 --> 34:25.875
She's my friend.
I say screw the rules.

34:29.715 --> 34:32.485
Can someone please tell me
what's going on?

34:34.255 --> 34:38.865
Gabriel Owen Emerson,
were you an ass to Julia?

34:38.935 --> 34:41.475
You two will just have to
kiss and make up.

34:41.535 --> 34:43.645
I'm only here for a week,

34:43.705 --> 34:47.015
and I expect to spend
lots of time with both of you.

34:52.795 --> 34:55.935
I... cannot believe
I just ran into you.

34:56.735 --> 34:59.405
So I tried it,
and I applied it to my head,

34:59.475 --> 35:00.975
and, of course, it did work.

35:01.045 --> 35:03.685
So, a week later,
it grows back this big.

35:03.745 --> 35:06.525
So, my first day of seventh
grade, I had a cowlick.

35:06.585 --> 35:09.125
Which was the best idea
I'd ever had.

35:09.195 --> 35:10.995
Welcome.

35:16.245 --> 35:20.885
Gabriel, want to give Julia the
grand tour while I start dinner?

35:40.025 --> 35:42.725
I'd like to show you something.

36:13.085 --> 36:15.425
Your study is so...

36:16.995 --> 36:18.735
beautiful.

36:25.885 --> 36:28.755
That's my favorite chair.

36:34.295 --> 36:36.435
Put these on.

37:10.265 --> 37:12.775
This is one of my most
precious possessions.

37:12.845 --> 37:15.745
A shrunken head of
a former grad student?

38:01.005 --> 38:05.585
Is that Botticelli's
original Dante and Beatrice

38:05.645 --> 38:07.545
and the fixed stars of Paradise?

38:07.615 --> 38:09.455
Sadly, no.

38:09.525 --> 38:13.525
That would be beyond the reach
of my small fortune.

38:13.595 --> 38:15.935
The originals date from
the 15th century.

38:16.005 --> 38:19.505
These reproductions
are from the 16th century.

38:19.575 --> 38:22.045
I didn't know copies existed.

38:22.115 --> 38:24.825
They were probably done by a
former student of Botticelli's.

38:25.785 --> 38:29.495
Botticelli prepared
one hundred illustrations,

38:29.565 --> 38:32.435
but only ninety-two
of them survived.

38:32.495 --> 38:35.905
I have the full complement.

38:37.405 --> 38:39.715
I went to see the originals
when they were on loan

38:39.785 --> 38:42.555
to the Uffizi Gallery
in Florence.

38:44.655 --> 38:48.465
Where did you get these?

38:48.535 --> 38:50.965
Why aren't they in a museum?

38:51.035 --> 38:53.675
They aren't in a museum because
I refuse to give them up.

38:54.875 --> 38:57.185
And no one knows I have them

38:57.245 --> 39:00.385
but my lawyer,
my insurance agent,

39:00.455 --> 39:03.195
and now you.

39:08.535 --> 39:12.245
Gabriel,
stop boring Julia with your antique crap,

39:12.315 --> 39:14.245
and get her a drink.

39:37.265 --> 39:39.805
Hey, what is going on
between you two?

39:39.865 --> 39:41.935
Why is he acting so weird?

39:42.005 --> 39:44.545
And why didn't you
tell him who you are?

39:44.605 --> 39:46.615
I thought he'd remember me.

39:48.285 --> 39:49.155
He doesn't.

39:49.225 --> 39:52.925
So...

39:52.995 --> 39:54.595
what are we having
with the wine?

39:54.665 --> 39:56.335
Couscous.

40:03.745 --> 40:05.085
I'm so sorry.

40:05.155 --> 40:06.985
Stop. Stop!

40:07.055 --> 40:09.765
Stop, woman! Stop!
For God sakes.

40:09.825 --> 40:11.195
Stop!

40:11.265 --> 40:13.405
You'll shred yourself
to ribbons.

40:14.775 --> 40:16.445
This way.

40:27.865 --> 40:30.165
Hold out your hands.

40:32.575 --> 40:35.075
You don't listen, do you?

40:35.945 --> 40:38.355
You don't do what you're told.

40:38.415 --> 40:40.925
This is going to sting.

40:42.155 --> 40:42.995
There.

40:45.935 --> 40:48.375
I'm so sorry.

40:48.435 --> 40:50.875
Accidents happen.

42:01.545 --> 42:03.225
Is she all right?

42:03.285 --> 42:06.225
Yes, but she hates couscous.

42:06.295 --> 42:09.805
All right, then I'll make
Rice Pilaf instead.

42:12.575 --> 42:15.015
There's something
you need to know about Julia.

42:15.075 --> 42:17.545
I shouldn't know
anything about her.

42:17.615 --> 42:19.425
She's my student.

42:19.485 --> 42:22.455
Her friendship with you already
presents a conflict of interest.

42:22.525 --> 42:24.995
She's been broken, you jackass.

42:25.065 --> 42:26.545
That's why I haven't
seen her in a year.

42:26.565 --> 42:28.405
She's finally
crawled out of her shell,

42:28.475 --> 42:30.175
and you're
forcing her back in there

42:30.245 --> 42:32.075
with your arrogance
and condescension.

42:32.145 --> 42:36.455
So just cut it with
the Mr. Darcy, Mr. Rochester,

42:36.525 --> 42:40.565
stuck-uppity bullshit.
Treat her like the treasure that she is.

42:40.625 --> 42:43.165
Fine.

42:46.645 --> 42:48.175
Ugh, it's Aaron.

42:48.245 --> 42:49.945
I've been trying to
get 'em all day.

42:50.015 --> 42:54.785
Hi. I'm good. You are not
gonna believe who I ran into.

43:44.485 --> 43:48.095
Did you know Rachel
got engaged this summer?

43:48.165 --> 43:51.265
That's wonderful.
Aaron's great.

43:51.335 --> 43:54.205
She ended
the engagement last week.

43:54.275 --> 43:56.815
They're still together, but...

43:56.885 --> 44:00.655
she doesn't feel like planning a
wedding now that Grace is gone.

44:00.715 --> 44:05.465
That's why she's here.
To get away from it all.

44:14.615 --> 44:17.285
I know the feeling.

44:30.015 --> 44:33.485
Were you ever going to
tell me who you are?

44:35.295 --> 44:39.135
You let me make
an ass out of myself.

44:39.195 --> 44:41.665
I would have treated you
better, if I'd known.

44:42.875 --> 44:45.515
Really? Would you?

44:45.575 --> 44:49.485
And found some other
grad student to rip apart?

44:49.555 --> 44:52.725
If that's the case,
I'm glad your anger was directed at me

44:52.795 --> 44:54.465
and not anyone else.

44:55.935 --> 45:00.005
This doesn't change anything.

45:00.075 --> 45:03.585
I am glad you're
Rachel's friend, but...

45:03.645 --> 45:05.455
you're still my student,

45:05.515 --> 45:07.485
which means that we need
to be professional,

45:07.555 --> 45:11.395
and you will be careful how you
speak to me now and in the future.

45:13.735 --> 45:17.975
Yes, Professor Emerson.

45:23.625 --> 45:25.795
I have a bad temper,

45:25.855 --> 45:28.165
I can be destructive.

45:28.235 --> 45:34.075
It would be inadvisable for me to lose
my temper around someone like you.

45:40.825 --> 45:45.665
Wrath is one of
the seven deadly sins.

45:47.605 --> 45:49.135
I have all seven.

45:49.205 --> 45:52.645
Somehow, I doubt that.

45:58.855 --> 46:03.965
You're only a magnet for mishap,

46:04.035 --> 46:06.445
while I'm a magnet for sin.

46:06.505 --> 46:09.915
Sin isn't attracted
to a human being.

46:09.985 --> 46:13.025
It's the other way around.

46:13.085 --> 46:15.855
Not in my experience.

46:15.925 --> 46:19.765
Sin seems to find me even
when I'm not looking for it.

46:22.435 --> 46:26.385
I'm not very good
at resisting temptation.

47:20.455 --> 47:23.465
Hey, Rach! I'm here.

47:28.375 --> 47:30.405
What happened?

47:31.275 --> 47:32.715
Gabriel is what happened.

47:32.775 --> 47:33.945
Is he hurt?

47:34.015 --> 47:35.515
Oh, he's fine.

47:35.585 --> 47:38.125
He's been here
less than 24 hours,

47:38.185 --> 47:41.595
and he's shoved my parents,
made my mom cry,

47:41.665 --> 47:44.665
and sent Scott
to the emergency room.

47:44.735 --> 47:46.475
It'll be okay.

47:46.545 --> 47:48.445
It's not okay, Aaron.

47:48.515 --> 47:50.385
Gabriel shoved Scott
into a table.

47:50.445 --> 47:53.085
Scott's not just
gonna forgive that.

47:53.155 --> 47:56.055
My mom's
in her room, hysterical.

47:56.125 --> 47:58.125
I can't even be here
another second.

47:58.195 --> 48:00.635
I'll check on your mom.

48:01.865 --> 48:04.175
My family is so broken.

48:07.715 --> 48:09.455
Rachel.

48:59.685 --> 49:03.155
You're a bit late for the show.

49:03.795 --> 49:06.205
You're hurt.

49:07.905 --> 49:09.635
You're cold.

49:15.915 --> 49:17.825
Thank you.

49:17.885 --> 49:20.365
Beer?

49:39.565 --> 49:42.205
Ever have a beer before?

49:48.815 --> 49:51.485
Then I'm glad I'm your first.

49:57.465 --> 50:00.645
What are you doing here?

50:00.705 --> 50:04.015
I was invited to dinner.

50:05.045 --> 50:07.585
I guess I ruined that.

50:12.335 --> 50:14.465
Will you tell me what happened?

50:14.535 --> 50:18.045
Will you tell me why
you haven't run away yet?

50:41.625 --> 50:44.025
You smell like vanilla.

50:44.095 --> 50:47.405
It's my shampoo.

51:00.925 --> 51:04.635
It wasn't supposed
to be like this.

51:09.415 --> 51:12.015
I didn't mean...

51:17.225 --> 51:19.835
The prodigal son returns...

51:20.335 --> 51:23.035
More like demon.

51:23.105 --> 51:25.575
The demon Gabriel.

51:27.885 --> 51:30.825
You're all
the Clark's talk about.

51:43.815 --> 51:46.425
Maybe Grace invited you over
because she knew

51:46.485 --> 51:52.125
I needed an angel
to watch over me.

52:17.085 --> 52:19.855
The sun is setting.

52:21.955 --> 52:24.095
Would you like to go for a walk?

52:49.115 --> 52:52.085
Have you ever held a boy's hand?

52:57.895 --> 53:01.065
Then I'm glad I'm your first.

53:05.675 --> 53:08.585
You're very quiet.

53:08.655 --> 53:11.525
Talk to me.
I promise I won't bite.

53:11.585 --> 53:14.065
Why did you come home?

53:14.125 --> 53:15.965
I lost something.

53:16.035 --> 53:19.275
And you're trying to
find it here?

53:19.335 --> 53:22.205
What I lost is lost forever.

53:24.385 --> 53:27.185
I came home for money.
I was...

53:28.325 --> 53:32.765
I was fucked up even before I
destroyed everything and everyone.

53:32.835 --> 53:35.235
Before you ever arrived.

53:49.465 --> 53:51.135
This is it.

53:54.545 --> 53:56.985
This is paradise.

54:19.355 --> 54:22.795
You'll catch pneumonia and die.

54:26.575 --> 54:34.585
You're Beatrice.

54:36.325 --> 54:38.795
Who's Beatrice?

54:38.865 --> 54:41.305
Dante's Beatrice.

54:43.705 --> 54:46.945
Dante was a poet.

54:48.715 --> 54:53.225
And Beatrice was his muse.

54:53.295 --> 54:58.875
He met her when she was young...

54:58.935 --> 55:01.775
and loved her from afar
his whole life.

55:01.845 --> 55:04.615
She was his guide
through Paradise.

55:06.515 --> 55:09.795
I'm writing a book about them.

55:10.965 --> 55:14.565
There's a famous painting
by Henry Holiday.

55:14.635 --> 55:17.675
You look like his Beatrice.

55:31.735 --> 55:34.775
Your family loves you.

55:34.845 --> 55:37.585
You should make up with them.

55:40.015 --> 55:43.225
They aren't my family.

55:43.295 --> 55:46.635
Not really.

55:46.705 --> 55:49.605
And it's too late anyway.

55:52.045 --> 55:54.115
You haven't had dinner.

56:10.985 --> 56:15.055
For you, Beatrice.

57:00.185 --> 57:02.185
Have you ever
looked up at the stars

57:02.245 --> 57:04.855
with a boy lying next to you?

57:34.045 --> 57:38.955
You're beautiful, Beatrice.

57:39.025 --> 57:42.065
My brown-eyed angel.

57:45.165 --> 57:48.405
I think you're beautiful, too.

58:01.105 --> 58:04.175
Have you ever been kissed?

58:18.205 --> 58:21.075
Then I'm glad I'm your first.

58:43.555 --> 58:46.525
Open your eyes.

59:02.485 --> 59:05.425
Gabriel?

59:05.495 --> 59:08.805
What are you thinking?

59:10.845 --> 59:13.915
About how I waited
for you for so long,

59:13.985 --> 59:16.385
and you never came.

59:20.425 --> 59:23.965
It's okay because
you're here now.

59:27.845 --> 59:31.745
Apparuit iam beatitudo vestra.

59:32.385 --> 59:36.325
That's pretty.
What does it mean?

59:39.135 --> 59:42.335
Now your blessedness appears.

59:42.405 --> 59:46.445
But it should be
"Now my blessedness appears."

59:46.515 --> 59:49.315
Now that you're here.

59:53.295 --> 59:54.695
For the rest of my life,

59:54.765 --> 59:57.865
I'll dream of hearing your
voice breathe my name.

1:00:11.295 --> 1:00:14.205
Do you have to leave?

1:00:14.265 --> 1:00:15.735
Yes,

1:00:15.805 --> 1:00:18.445
but not tonight.

1:00:19.845 --> 1:00:22.215
Will you come back?

1:00:23.415 --> 1:00:27.225
I'll be thrown out of
Paradise tomorrow, Beatrice.

1:00:29.195 --> 1:00:32.635
Our only hope
is that you find me one day.

1:00:39.655 --> 1:00:42.655
Look for me in Hell.

1:01:15.055 --> 1:01:18.065
What's this for?

1:01:18.125 --> 1:01:20.765
Aren't you going shopping
with Julianne?

1:01:20.835 --> 1:01:23.305
It's Julia.
And no.

1:01:23.375 --> 1:01:25.645
She's working on a project
with a guy named Paul,

1:01:25.705 --> 1:01:27.885
and then he's
taking her to dinner.

1:01:27.945 --> 1:01:29.415
Angel fucker.

1:01:29.485 --> 1:01:31.385
What?

1:01:31.455 --> 1:01:33.025
Take it.

1:01:33.095 --> 1:01:35.665
Buy something nice
for your friend.

1:01:35.725 --> 1:01:37.705
Gabriel, I know
you have money to waste,

1:01:37.765 --> 1:01:40.275
but jeepers, this is a bit much.

1:01:40.335 --> 1:01:43.545
She carries a loathsome
excuse for a bookbag.

1:01:43.615 --> 1:01:46.685
Spend the money on
buying her a decent briefcase,

1:01:46.755 --> 1:01:50.495
because if I see that bag one more
time, I'm going to burn it.

1:01:50.565 --> 1:01:53.095
Okay, I'll buy her a briefcase.

1:01:53.165 --> 1:01:55.865
I'd rather buy her shoes.

1:01:55.935 --> 1:01:57.545
- Shoes?
- Yeah.

1:01:57.605 --> 1:02:00.115
She likes pretty things.
She just can't afford them.

1:02:02.185 --> 1:02:03.555
She's pretty cute, huh?

1:02:03.615 --> 1:02:05.425
Spend the money on
whatever you like,

1:02:05.485 --> 1:02:07.565
but you must replace
the book bag.

1:02:07.625 --> 1:02:09.335
I have an account
at Holt Renfrew.

1:02:09.395 --> 1:02:13.975
Oh. I'll buy her
something fabulous.

1:02:14.045 --> 1:02:16.015
Should I add lingerie
to the list?

1:02:16.075 --> 1:02:18.885
How old are we?

1:02:18.945 --> 1:02:20.115
Do you like her, like her?

1:02:20.185 --> 1:02:22.855
She's my student.

1:02:22.925 --> 1:02:25.495
Should I tell her that the
briefcase and shoes are from you?

1:02:25.565 --> 1:02:29.175
Are you crazy?
I could get fired for that.

1:02:29.235 --> 1:02:30.745
Someone will jump
to the wrong conclusion,

1:02:30.775 --> 1:02:32.285
and I'll be hauled in
before the judicial committee!

1:02:32.305 --> 1:02:34.315
Why are you wound so tight?

1:02:34.385 --> 1:02:36.415
Are you having girl troubles?

1:02:36.485 --> 1:02:40.155
And, by the way, what are with
those photos in your bedroom...

1:02:40.225 --> 1:02:42.935
I am not having
this conversation.

1:02:42.995 --> 1:02:45.065
Don't bark at me.

1:02:45.805 --> 1:02:47.375
I'm sorry, okay?

1:02:47.445 --> 1:02:50.345
Just... just don't
tell her it's from me.

1:02:50.415 --> 1:02:53.185
She wouldn't accept them
if she knew.

1:02:53.255 --> 1:02:55.185
She... she hates me.

1:02:55.255 --> 1:02:57.695
Julia is not the type
of girl to hate anybody.

1:02:57.765 --> 1:03:00.765
She's far too
forgiving for that.

1:03:00.835 --> 1:03:03.705
But you're probably right.
She probably wouldn't accept charity.

1:03:03.775 --> 1:03:06.515
Tell her it's for
a backlog of Christmas presents.

1:03:10.925 --> 1:03:13.755
Or tell her it's from Grace.

1:03:34.765 --> 1:03:36.285
I'll show you
the Dante collection,

1:03:36.305 --> 1:03:37.815
then my study carrel
which is next to it.

1:03:37.845 --> 1:03:41.515
Well, not mine.
Emerson shares his with me.

1:03:45.155 --> 1:03:47.765
Here it is.

1:03:53.605 --> 1:03:56.045
Pretty impressive, right?

1:04:00.215 --> 1:04:02.585
The carrel's just down here.

1:04:25.805 --> 1:04:29.105
Can I ask you
a personal question?

1:04:29.945 --> 1:04:32.285
Why didn't you go to Harvard?

1:04:32.345 --> 1:04:34.355
I overheard Emerson
asking Greg Matthews,

1:04:34.425 --> 1:04:37.105
the chair of Romance Languages and
Literatures at Harvard, about you.

1:04:37.125 --> 1:04:39.665
He was wondering why they
didn't have enough funding

1:04:39.735 --> 1:04:41.675
for their grad students.
He sounded pretty pissed.

1:04:41.705 --> 1:04:45.375
He was checking up on me?
Of course.

1:04:45.445 --> 1:04:47.185
Well, from what I could hear,

1:04:47.245 --> 1:04:49.555
Matthews said to
send you back for your PhD.

1:04:49.615 --> 1:04:52.525
Said you were highly ranked
in their admissions pool.

1:04:52.585 --> 1:04:55.495
So, if it isn't too personal,

1:04:55.565 --> 1:04:57.535
why didn't you go to Harvard?

1:04:58.935 --> 1:05:01.445
I couldn't afford it.

1:05:01.505 --> 1:05:05.615
I didn't want to come here.
I had no other choice.

1:05:05.685 --> 1:05:08.585
I was hoping to finish
my MA quickly

1:05:08.655 --> 1:05:10.355
and go to Harvard next year.

1:05:10.425 --> 1:05:12.225
If I win a larger fellowship.

1:05:12.295 --> 1:05:14.565
I can relate.

1:05:17.675 --> 1:05:19.945
You should use
this carrel for studying.

1:05:20.015 --> 1:05:22.215
Emerson is rarely here.
I'll give you my extra key.

1:05:22.285 --> 1:05:24.585
Emerson hates me.
He won't like this.

1:05:24.655 --> 1:05:29.335
I insist.
Please, Rabbit.

1:05:38.145 --> 1:05:40.355
Thank you.

1:05:50.335 --> 1:05:52.545
Do you like Mozart's Requiem?

1:05:52.605 --> 1:05:55.715
Not really.
Emerson ruined it for me.

1:05:55.785 --> 1:05:59.425
He was playing one track from the
damn thing over and over again

1:05:59.495 --> 1:06:01.625
while I was cataloging
part of his personal library.

1:06:01.695 --> 1:06:05.035
Lacrimosa, Lacrimosa,
Lacri-frickin-mosa.

1:06:05.105 --> 1:06:07.505
I couldn't take it anymore.
It's so damned depressing.

1:06:07.575 --> 1:06:10.245
I love Mozart's Requiem,

1:06:10.315 --> 1:06:13.915
and Lacrimosa
is my favorite part.

1:06:16.525 --> 1:06:19.595
Uh, I've got tickets
to a German film on Saturday.

1:06:19.665 --> 1:06:21.335
Wanna go?

1:06:21.405 --> 1:06:24.505
Sure.
Is it subtitled?

1:06:24.575 --> 1:06:28.685
Good, because I only know
how to swear in German.

1:07:39.495 --> 1:07:40.965
Hello.

1:07:41.025 --> 1:07:44.465
Hey, Julia.
Got any plans tonight?

1:07:47.345 --> 1:07:48.575
Julia?

1:07:48.645 --> 1:07:51.485
Hi. Yes.
Um, tonight? No plans.

1:07:51.545 --> 1:07:53.485
Good, I want to go to a club.

1:07:53.555 --> 1:07:55.785
You know I hate those places.

1:07:55.855 --> 1:07:57.995
I can't dance,
and it's too loud.

1:07:58.065 --> 1:07:59.695
It's so funny that you say that.

1:07:59.765 --> 1:08:02.665
Gabriel said almost
the exact same thing.

1:08:02.735 --> 1:08:04.675
Gabriel would come with us?

1:08:04.745 --> 1:08:07.075
He isn't happy about it,
but he didn't say no.

1:08:07.145 --> 1:08:09.885
I have nothing to wear.

1:08:09.955 --> 1:08:13.255
Hmm, I happen to know a certain
delivery was made today.

1:08:13.325 --> 1:08:14.565
That was you!?

1:08:14.625 --> 1:08:16.165
Do you like everything?

1:08:16.225 --> 1:08:18.805
It's too much.
I can't accept it.

1:08:18.865 --> 1:08:19.905
The shoes are...

1:08:19.975 --> 1:08:21.775
Julia, please.

1:08:21.845 --> 1:08:25.185
I'm so happy that
we're friends again.

1:08:25.245 --> 1:08:27.185
Apart from running into you,

1:08:27.255 --> 1:08:29.195
and getting a chance to
get close to Gabriel again,

1:08:29.225 --> 1:08:31.865
nothing good has happened
to me since my mom got sick.

1:08:31.925 --> 1:08:36.805
Please, just think of it
as a belated birthday present,

1:08:36.875 --> 1:08:39.045
and early Christmas gift
from me and my mom.

1:08:40.515 --> 1:08:43.455
Thank you, Rachel.

1:08:43.515 --> 1:08:46.025
Ok, so we're gonna pick you up at 9.
Be ready. Bye!

1:08:47.825 --> 1:08:49.765
Gabriel, Julia is gonna come!

1:09:25.265 --> 1:09:27.505
- Ethan.
- Mr. Emerson.

1:09:27.575 --> 1:09:30.545
This is my sister Rachel
and her friend, Julianne.

1:09:55.125 --> 1:10:01.305
Julia looks so beautiful,
right, Gabriel?

1:10:01.375 --> 1:10:03.145
Really, really gorgeous.

1:10:03.205 --> 1:10:04.375
Please, Rachel,

1:10:04.445 --> 1:10:07.115
What?
Isn't she beautiful?

1:10:07.185 --> 1:10:09.855
You both look fine.

1:10:19.175 --> 1:10:21.315
So, how was your date with Paul?

1:10:21.385 --> 1:10:24.055
It was really nice.

1:10:24.115 --> 1:10:25.385
Are you gonna see him again?

1:10:25.455 --> 1:10:27.525
Yes.
Tomorrow he's taking me

1:10:27.595 --> 1:10:29.635
to a double-feature
at the Film Festival,

1:10:29.695 --> 1:10:32.035
and then afterward,
to Chinatown.

1:10:32.105 --> 1:10:33.735
Is he cute?

1:10:33.805 --> 1:10:37.275
He's handsome and kind.

1:10:37.345 --> 1:10:39.245
He treats me like a princess.

1:10:39.315 --> 1:10:40.555
Angel fucker.

1:10:40.615 --> 1:10:42.655
Alicia!

1:10:42.715 --> 1:10:45.025
What will it be ladies?

1:10:45.095 --> 1:10:48.235
We'll have two Cosmos.
You'll love them.

1:10:48.305 --> 1:10:50.935
A double shot of Laphroaig
25-year-old, neat, please.

1:10:51.005 --> 1:10:53.175
And a small glass of
spring water, non-sparkling.

1:10:53.245 --> 1:10:56.685
Only you could make
a drink pretentious.

1:10:56.755 --> 1:10:59.525
It's single malt whiskey.

1:10:59.585 --> 1:11:01.965
I'll let you try it
when it arrives.

1:11:03.065 --> 1:11:04.735
We're gonna dance.

1:11:48.155 --> 1:11:50.225
I can't dance in these shoes.

1:11:50.295 --> 1:11:51.895
Just move your body.

1:11:51.965 --> 1:11:55.765
You look great, by the way.
My brother is an idiot.

1:12:21.885 --> 1:12:24.125
She's with me.

1:12:31.945 --> 1:12:34.985
I was fine.
And he was nice.

1:12:35.045 --> 1:12:36.815
He put his hands on you.

1:12:36.885 --> 1:12:40.855
We were dancing.
I tripped.

1:12:42.365 --> 1:12:45.065
I didn't hear you
asking me to dance.

1:12:46.405 --> 1:12:49.775
That would rather defeat
the purpose of watching,

1:12:49.845 --> 1:12:52.045
don't you think?

1:12:59.625 --> 1:13:01.305
I promised you a taste.

1:13:06.345 --> 1:13:07.715
No.

1:13:07.785 --> 1:13:09.915
I insist.

1:13:13.625 --> 1:13:16.065
Let me feed you.

1:13:20.375 --> 1:13:22.745
I can feed myself.

1:13:22.805 --> 1:13:25.685
Of course you can,
but why should you...

1:13:25.745 --> 1:13:28.125
when I'm here to do it for you?

1:13:36.465 --> 1:13:37.475
That's awful!

1:13:37.535 --> 1:13:40.345
It tastes like a campfire.

1:13:40.415 --> 1:13:42.085
That's the peat.

1:13:42.145 --> 1:13:45.025
It's an acquired taste.

1:13:46.525 --> 1:13:48.465
You might decide it's a
taste you want to acquire,

1:13:48.495 --> 1:13:50.235
once you've tried it
a few times.

1:13:50.295 --> 1:13:51.635
I doubt it.

1:13:51.705 --> 1:13:54.435
And by the way, I'm a big girl.
I can look after myself,

1:13:54.505 --> 1:13:57.745
so unless I ask for your help,
please leave me be.

1:13:57.815 --> 1:14:02.285
Nonsense. Your naiveté
is hard to hide.

1:14:03.625 --> 1:14:05.795
What's that supposed to mean?

1:14:05.865 --> 1:14:08.935
Do I need to
spell it out for you?

1:14:11.505 --> 1:14:13.945
You blush like a teenager.

1:14:14.915 --> 1:14:17.955
And I can sense your innocence.

1:14:19.625 --> 1:14:23.865
It's more than obvious
you're still a virgin, so...

1:14:26.435 --> 1:14:30.715
stop pretending
to be anything else.

1:14:30.775 --> 1:14:33.785
Especially in a place like this.

1:14:34.885 --> 1:14:38.465
You...

1:14:38.525 --> 1:14:41.235
You...

1:14:41.305 --> 1:14:42.965
Stronzo!

1:14:44.435 --> 1:14:46.345
Stronzo?

1:14:59.735 --> 1:15:01.245
- Whoa!
- Sorry.

1:15:01.305 --> 1:15:02.445
No problem.

1:15:02.505 --> 1:15:03.715
Ladies bathroom?

1:15:03.775 --> 1:15:05.885
Oh, it's on the other side.
Damn it.

1:15:05.945 --> 1:15:08.585
Nah, I'm sorry,
I'm having, um...

1:15:08.655 --> 1:15:11.795
text trouble.
Julianne, right?

1:15:11.865 --> 1:15:14.495
Um, it's Julia, actually.

1:15:14.565 --> 1:15:16.305
You don't happen to
speak Italian, do you?

1:15:16.365 --> 1:15:18.445
I saw you came with Mr. Emerson,
so I kinda figured...

1:15:18.475 --> 1:15:21.315
- Yes.
- Would you help me text something to my girlfriend?

1:15:21.385 --> 1:15:23.515
She's Italian.
I'd love to impress her.

1:15:23.585 --> 1:15:26.825
Gabriel's Italian is much better than mine.
You should ask him.

1:15:26.895 --> 1:15:30.335
Are you kidding?
I don't want him anywhere near my woman.

1:15:31.805 --> 1:15:33.535
So would you?

1:15:46.295 --> 1:15:47.565
Ethan.

1:15:47.635 --> 1:15:49.975
Mr. Emerson.

1:15:52.675 --> 1:15:54.575
Julia.

1:16:13.615 --> 1:16:16.155
Why did you
give him your number?

1:16:16.225 --> 1:16:19.925
He lives with a woman.
And now he's calling you Julia?

1:16:19.995 --> 1:16:22.835
That's my name, Professor.

1:16:22.905 --> 1:16:25.775
And I didn't give him my number.

1:16:25.845 --> 1:16:28.915
I was helping him.

1:16:32.625 --> 1:16:33.995
Dance with me.

1:16:34.055 --> 1:16:35.665
Not a chance in hell.

1:16:35.725 --> 1:16:37.335
Don't be so difficult.

1:16:37.395 --> 1:16:40.905
I'm just getting started being
difficult with you, Professor.

1:16:40.975 --> 1:16:44.475
Watch it.

1:16:44.545 --> 1:16:47.485
Why don't you just stick
a knife in my heart

1:16:47.555 --> 1:16:50.925
and get it over with?

1:16:50.995 --> 1:16:53.625
Haven't you hurt me enough?

1:16:57.735 --> 1:17:00.715
Julianne.

1:17:00.775 --> 1:17:03.215
Am I so evil?

1:17:06.355 --> 1:17:09.265
I have no wish to hurt you.

1:17:13.935 --> 1:17:19.915
Will you do me the honor
of dancing with me?

1:17:22.055 --> 1:17:26.095
I've been
a giant stronzo tonight.

1:17:27.595 --> 1:17:30.935
Mi dispiace.

1:17:31.005 --> 1:17:33.305
One dance.

1:18:46.625 --> 1:18:51.035
I don't think
this is very professional,

1:18:51.095 --> 1:18:52.765
us dancing.

1:18:53.975 --> 1:18:59.015
I'm not being professional
at all with you tonight.

1:19:00.785 --> 1:19:03.825
I only wanted to dance with
the prettiest girl in the club.

1:19:03.895 --> 1:19:06.525
Don't make fun of me.

1:19:10.935 --> 1:19:13.505
I'm not.

1:19:23.095 --> 1:19:25.535
Your face is familiar.

1:19:29.505 --> 1:19:32.685
Are you sure Rachel
didn't introduce us?

1:19:40.535 --> 1:19:43.735
But you do
remind me of Beatrice,

1:19:43.805 --> 1:19:47.945
from Holiday's painting.

1:19:48.015 --> 1:19:50.285
Isn't it funny that you own it?

1:19:52.055 --> 1:19:54.495
Gabriel.

1:19:58.535 --> 1:20:01.805
Your dress is lovely.

1:20:02.845 --> 1:20:06.185
And those shoes are...

1:20:06.245 --> 1:20:09.325
exquisite.

1:20:09.385 --> 1:20:12.765
Rachel and Grace
are very generous.

1:20:12.825 --> 1:20:15.135
Unlike me.

1:20:15.205 --> 1:20:17.975
I never said that.

1:20:18.035 --> 1:20:21.315
I was hungry and you fed me.

1:20:21.375 --> 1:20:24.415
That was generous.

1:20:24.485 --> 1:20:28.055
Promise me you'll tell me
if you're starving.

1:20:28.125 --> 1:20:31.435
I won't let you starve.

1:20:31.495 --> 1:20:34.705
I promise, but I'm okay.

1:20:34.775 --> 1:20:38.515
I've had my fill of steak and...

1:20:38.585 --> 1:20:40.115
apples.

1:20:40.185 --> 1:20:41.315
I'll speak to the department

1:20:41.385 --> 1:20:44.495
about increasing
your fellowship.

1:20:44.555 --> 1:20:48.135
Really, I'm fine, Professor.
Thank you.

1:20:52.445 --> 1:20:56.745
It's all right.
You can say it.

1:20:58.285 --> 1:21:02.525
I was...

1:21:02.595 --> 1:21:05.305
if you ever need someone
to talk to...

1:21:05.365 --> 1:21:09.045
About Grace, I mean.

1:21:09.105 --> 1:21:11.075
Not that it would be
very professional,

1:21:11.145 --> 1:21:13.115
but I'll be around.

1:21:13.185 --> 1:21:15.825
Um. Yeah, that's all.

1:21:19.725 --> 1:21:25.175
Julianne, that's
a very kind offer.

1:21:25.245 --> 1:21:29.385
Thank you.

1:21:29.445 --> 1:21:31.555
I don't like to talk about
certain things,

1:21:31.615 --> 1:21:35.565
but...
I'll keep that in mind.

1:21:54.795 --> 1:21:58.645
I've never danced
like this before.

1:22:01.175 --> 1:22:04.755
Then I'm glad I'm your first.

1:22:09.095 --> 1:22:11.495
What's wrong?

1:22:31.235 --> 1:22:33.975
You have to stop
buying me things.

1:22:34.045 --> 1:22:35.745
I may have picked it out,

1:22:35.815 --> 1:22:39.985
but Gabriel's actually
the one who bought it.

1:22:40.055 --> 1:22:41.725
What? Why?

1:22:41.795 --> 1:22:43.965
Just open it.

1:22:54.455 --> 1:22:55.985
It's Italian.

1:22:56.055 --> 1:22:58.925
We both know you
and Gabriel have a thing.

1:22:58.995 --> 1:23:00.435
For Italy.

1:23:00.495 --> 1:23:02.805
I was not supposed to
tell you it was from him.

1:23:02.865 --> 1:23:06.205
He would kill me if he
found out that I told you.

1:23:06.275 --> 1:23:07.575
I don't need his charity.

1:23:07.645 --> 1:23:11.825
It's not charity.
He hates your knapsack.

1:23:11.885 --> 1:23:13.555
I have a lifetime guarantee.

1:23:13.625 --> 1:23:14.745
I can just go get a new one.

1:23:14.795 --> 1:23:16.595
This is way too expensive.

1:23:16.665 --> 1:23:18.765
It's not like he's gonna
miss the money.

1:23:18.835 --> 1:23:21.405
Professors don't make that much.

1:23:21.475 --> 1:23:26.185
Julia. Gabriel's,
like, super rich.

1:23:26.245 --> 1:23:27.915
What?

1:23:30.695 --> 1:23:34.535
So, you know my parents adopted
Gabriel when he was nine?

1:23:34.595 --> 1:23:37.775
My mother found him wandering
a hospital in Sunbury.

1:23:37.835 --> 1:23:42.285
His mother had just died.
Pneumonia, I think.

1:23:42.345 --> 1:23:44.885
He was poor and starving.

1:23:44.955 --> 1:23:49.325
My parents adopted him
after his family rejected him.

1:23:50.895 --> 1:23:55.545
I'm so sorry, Rachel.
I didn't know.

1:23:55.605 --> 1:23:59.445
So, a few years ago,
his biological father died,

1:23:59.515 --> 1:24:02.885
and for some reason
left him a huge inheritance.

1:24:02.955 --> 1:24:04.995
I think he's trying to
stick it to his old man

1:24:05.055 --> 1:24:08.405
and spend the money faster
than it accumulates interest.

1:24:14.105 --> 1:24:19.925
Gabriel pretends to be whole,
but deep down he hates himself.

1:24:19.985 --> 1:24:21.825
I did tell him
to be nicer to you,

1:24:21.895 --> 1:24:24.295
so I think his behavior
will improve.

1:24:24.365 --> 1:24:26.765
He ignores me, mostly.

1:24:26.835 --> 1:24:31.015
Uh, don't you notice
how he stares at you?

1:24:32.185 --> 1:24:34.015
He does?

1:24:35.355 --> 1:24:37.655
Gabriel has been
on the outs for so long.

1:24:37.725 --> 1:24:40.225
He's finally letting me
back into his life.

1:24:40.295 --> 1:24:42.765
If you refuse this bag he's
gonna know that I told you.

1:24:42.835 --> 1:24:44.705
Please...

1:24:45.875 --> 1:24:48.485
Okay. I'll take the bag.
For you.

1:24:48.545 --> 1:24:50.115
Good. If you want,

1:24:50.185 --> 1:24:52.955
you can pretend it's another
birthday present from me.

1:24:54.525 --> 1:24:56.925
I don't really celebrate
my birthday anymore.

1:25:00.775 --> 1:25:03.845
Have you heard from him?

1:25:03.905 --> 1:25:06.915
Not since I changed my number.

1:25:09.085 --> 1:25:11.995
I could run him over with my
car for what he did to you.

1:25:19.905 --> 1:25:22.045
I wish Gabriel had taken
a page from your book

1:25:22.115 --> 1:25:25.525
and learned a thing or two about
how to deal with heartbreak.

1:25:27.655 --> 1:25:29.565
Can you watch over him for me?

1:25:29.625 --> 1:25:32.535
If you see him start
to act strangely,

1:25:32.605 --> 1:25:34.605
or if he gets
in trouble, call me?

1:25:34.675 --> 1:25:38.685
With our mom gone,
I just... I worry about him.

1:25:39.985 --> 1:25:41.685
Sure.

1:25:41.755 --> 1:25:45.395
I am so glad that you're around.

1:25:45.465 --> 1:25:47.965
You can be his guardian angel.

1:25:49.705 --> 1:25:52.675
So, Paul seems nice.

1:26:04.865 --> 1:26:07.405
What does the "V" stand for?

1:26:13.915 --> 1:26:17.085
You, uh, promise not
to tell anyone?

1:26:17.155 --> 1:26:18.155
Of course!

1:26:18.225 --> 1:26:20.425
It's Virgil.

1:26:20.495 --> 1:26:22.205
Virgil?

1:26:22.265 --> 1:26:25.205
You're studying to become
a Dante specialist,

1:26:25.275 --> 1:26:26.905
and your middle name is Virgil?

1:26:26.975 --> 1:26:29.785
Don't laugh.
It's a family name.

1:26:29.845 --> 1:26:33.755
After my great-grandfather,
a dairy farmer from Essex, Vermont,

1:26:33.825 --> 1:26:36.765
who I can guarantee you
never read Dante.

1:26:36.825 --> 1:26:39.635
I think it's a beautiful name.

1:26:56.435 --> 1:26:58.945
Little Rabbit.

1:27:01.575 --> 1:27:03.445
Isn't this cozy?

1:27:03.515 --> 1:27:05.255
Slumming with M.A.
students, Paul?

1:27:05.315 --> 1:27:08.195
Two coffees, Christa?
Pulling an all-nighter?

1:27:08.255 --> 1:27:10.295
Oh, you have no idea.

1:27:10.365 --> 1:27:12.835
One for me and one for Gabriel.

1:27:12.905 --> 1:27:16.045
Oh, Professor Emerson to you.

1:27:16.105 --> 1:27:18.275
You've never called him
Gabriel to his face.

1:27:18.345 --> 1:27:20.315
I dare you to do it
the next time you see him.

1:27:20.385 --> 1:27:22.225
You dare me? Funny.

1:27:22.285 --> 1:27:25.865
After our meeting, we'll probably
head over to Lobby for drinks.

1:27:25.925 --> 1:27:29.035
He likes to go there after
work to, you know, unwind.

1:27:29.105 --> 1:27:30.305
You're not his type.

1:27:30.365 --> 1:27:31.705
Excuse me?

1:27:31.775 --> 1:27:34.245
I said, don't believe the hype.

1:27:34.305 --> 1:27:36.015
As if they'd let you in.

1:27:36.085 --> 1:27:37.345
That's enough Christa.

1:27:37.415 --> 1:27:38.655
I just meant you have to pass

1:27:38.715 --> 1:27:40.855
some kind of
standard I.Q. test first.

1:27:40.925 --> 1:27:43.925
And from what Gabriel says,
you're not very bright.

1:27:43.995 --> 1:27:48.205
Oh, really?
And what else does Gabriel say?

1:27:51.345 --> 1:27:54.185
Paul. Miss Mitchell,

1:27:54.245 --> 1:27:58.155
you're looking smart, as always.

1:28:03.035 --> 1:28:04.705
Miss Peterson.

1:28:14.555 --> 1:28:15.895
Now, where were we?

1:28:15.965 --> 1:28:18.535
I'm sorry.
I should never have kissed you.

1:28:18.605 --> 1:28:22.005
It's okay.
I've wanted to kiss you

1:28:22.075 --> 1:28:24.915
since the first
day I saw you, but...

1:28:26.015 --> 1:28:30.285
Julia, the kiss doesn't
have to change anything.

1:28:30.355 --> 1:28:34.265
Just think of it
as a moment between friends.

1:28:34.325 --> 1:28:36.105
Would that make it better?

1:28:37.165 --> 1:28:40.775
You've been nothing
but nice to me.

1:28:40.845 --> 1:28:44.485
I'm nice to you
because I want to be.

1:28:44.555 --> 1:28:49.595
Don't feel obligated to do
anything you don't want to do.

1:28:49.665 --> 1:28:51.235
I'll be your friend
no matter what.

1:28:51.295 --> 1:28:54.235
And if one day, you want more...

1:28:54.305 --> 1:28:56.505
I'm not ready.

1:28:58.175 --> 1:29:02.385
I know.

1:29:02.455 --> 1:29:05.155
Looks like Emerson's
giving Christa hell.

1:29:07.835 --> 1:29:11.005
You should have given her hell
for how she talked to you.

1:29:11.075 --> 1:29:14.575
I try not to lower myself
to her level.

1:29:14.645 --> 1:29:20.085
I like to think goodness can
expose evil for what it really is.

1:29:20.155 --> 1:29:24.935
Not that I think I'm good.
I don't think I'm good.

1:29:24.995 --> 1:29:28.105
I'm not making any sense.

1:29:28.175 --> 1:29:30.205
Of course, you're making sense.

1:29:30.275 --> 1:29:33.345
We talked about this
in my Aquinas seminar.

1:29:33.415 --> 1:29:34.825
Evil is its own punishment.

1:29:38.495 --> 1:29:40.295
Refill?

1:30:08.085 --> 1:30:10.325
"Dear, Miss Mitchell,

1:30:10.385 --> 1:30:12.695
"Congratulations,
you are the recipient

1:30:12.765 --> 1:30:14.895
"of the M. P. Emerson Bursary

1:30:14.965 --> 1:30:18.135
in the amount of $5000
per semester."

1:31:51.455 --> 1:31:54.125
Shh, Julianne.
Julianne, it's just me.

1:31:54.195 --> 1:31:55.805
What are you doing in my carrel?

1:31:55.865 --> 1:31:57.975
Oh, my God.
I'm so sorry.

1:31:58.035 --> 1:32:01.075
I borrowed Paul's key.
I'm so sorry.

1:32:01.145 --> 1:32:03.615
I'll get out of your way.
I'm sorry.

1:32:03.685 --> 1:32:06.285
Julianne, it's all right.

1:32:06.355 --> 1:32:09.965
You're welcome to be here.
Julianne?

1:32:12.235 --> 1:32:14.135
Julianne?

1:32:14.935 --> 1:32:16.445
Are you ok?

1:32:16.505 --> 1:32:18.245
What happened?

1:32:18.315 --> 1:32:21.455
I think you grew light-headed
when you stood up too quickly.

1:32:21.515 --> 1:32:23.785
It's warm in here.

1:32:33.175 --> 1:32:35.915
I don't mind you
using the carrel.

1:32:35.985 --> 1:32:38.755
I'm glad Paul offered it.

1:32:38.825 --> 1:32:40.825
Is he here?

1:32:40.885 --> 1:32:42.965
He's at Princeton
presenting a paper.

1:32:43.025 --> 1:32:45.595
Ah, yes, that's right.

1:32:47.465 --> 1:32:49.745
That's a fine briefcase
you have.

1:32:49.805 --> 1:32:52.245
Thank you.

1:32:53.315 --> 1:32:55.655
There appears to be
something alive in it.

1:32:55.715 --> 1:32:57.785
May I?

1:33:02.235 --> 1:33:07.445
Oh, this is, um... nice.

1:33:10.415 --> 1:33:13.525
R? Who is R?

1:33:13.585 --> 1:33:15.655
It's a nickname.

1:33:15.725 --> 1:33:17.395
Why not B?

1:33:20.105 --> 1:33:22.375
Beautiful.

1:33:28.185 --> 1:33:29.925
Have you had dinner?

1:33:29.985 --> 1:33:31.295
No.

1:33:31.355 --> 1:33:32.825
Join me?

1:33:32.895 --> 1:33:34.565
Are you sure?

1:33:34.625 --> 1:33:37.735
I am not the kind of person
who makes idle invitations.

1:33:37.805 --> 1:33:40.805
If I invite you to dinner,
then I'm sure.

1:33:40.875 --> 1:33:44.415
Now, are you coming or not?

1:33:47.485 --> 1:33:50.925
You can talk about
your thesis proposal.

1:33:52.735 --> 1:33:55.175
Thank you, Professor.

1:34:09.135 --> 1:34:12.545
Their Caesar salads
are quite good,

1:34:12.605 --> 1:34:15.915
as is their Neapolitan pizza.
But they're quite large.

1:34:15.985 --> 1:34:18.925
Are you the type to share?

1:34:18.985 --> 1:34:21.125
I mean, would you share with me?

1:34:21.195 --> 1:34:22.495
Or order whatever you like.

1:34:22.565 --> 1:34:25.935
Perhaps you don't like
pizza and salad.

1:34:26.005 --> 1:34:28.475
I'd like to share with you.
Thank you.

1:34:38.255 --> 1:34:40.625
Are you cold?

1:34:57.825 --> 1:34:59.905
Thank you.

1:35:06.445 --> 1:35:08.115
Better?

1:35:09.025 --> 1:35:11.055
Better.

1:35:12.195 --> 1:35:16.265
So, let's hear it.

1:35:16.335 --> 1:35:18.875
I see the wheels turning
in that little mind of yours,

1:35:18.935 --> 1:35:21.445
so out with it.

1:35:25.785 --> 1:35:28.295
I can't accept these.

1:35:31.595 --> 1:35:34.975
What makes you
think they're from me?

1:35:37.705 --> 1:35:42.255
You can accept them.
And you will.

1:35:43.585 --> 1:35:46.525
I don't think this is very
professional, Professor Emerson.

1:35:46.595 --> 1:35:48.735
It looks like
you're trying to buy me.

1:35:48.795 --> 1:35:51.005
Buy you?

1:35:54.405 --> 1:35:56.415
If I wanted you at all,

1:35:56.485 --> 1:35:58.985
I certainly wouldn't
have to buy you.

1:35:59.055 --> 1:36:01.695
Watch it.

1:36:08.105 --> 1:36:11.375
I meant...

1:36:11.445 --> 1:36:12.945
you are not the type of woman

1:36:13.015 --> 1:36:16.455
who could be bought, are you?

1:36:20.325 --> 1:36:23.805
Why do you do that?
Provoke me?

1:36:23.865 --> 1:36:26.675
I don't. I'm not...

1:36:26.745 --> 1:36:29.145
You are my professor.

1:36:29.215 --> 1:36:32.315
And your best friend's
older brother.

1:36:32.385 --> 1:36:36.625
Can't we just be
Julianne and Gabriel

1:36:36.695 --> 1:36:40.105
for an evening?

1:36:40.165 --> 1:36:42.405
It might not
seem obvious to you,

1:36:42.475 --> 1:36:44.805
but I'm trying to be human here.

1:36:44.875 --> 1:36:46.785
You are?

1:37:01.105 --> 1:37:04.285
You wish to be professional,

1:37:04.345 --> 1:37:07.285
then act like it.

1:37:07.355 --> 1:37:11.025
Accept the bursary,
like a normal grad student,

1:37:11.095 --> 1:37:13.435
and be profoundly grateful.

1:37:13.505 --> 1:37:16.275
I don't want to play Héloise
to your Abelard.

1:37:16.345 --> 1:37:20.115
I would never seduce a student.

1:37:26.365 --> 1:37:28.565
Then thank you.

1:37:30.935 --> 1:37:35.115
Never be ashamed to accept a gift
when there are no strings attached.

1:37:37.885 --> 1:37:40.755
Grace used to say that.

1:37:53.315 --> 1:37:55.885
Paulina, what is it?

1:37:57.225 --> 1:37:59.125
Excuse me.

1:38:23.505 --> 1:38:26.315
I'm sorry.
I gotta go. I...

1:38:39.645 --> 1:38:42.785
The waiter will
pack up your meal.

1:38:45.485 --> 1:38:48.225
Good night, Julianne.

1:38:49.025 --> 1:38:52.535
I'll see you on Wednesday.

1:38:54.205 --> 1:38:57.105
If I'm still here.

1:39:33.985 --> 1:39:35.655
Julia!

1:39:36.455 --> 1:39:38.255
- Hey, Ethan.
- Hey.

1:39:38.325 --> 1:39:40.165
First of all, thanks for helping me
with my girlfriend the other day.

1:39:40.195 --> 1:39:41.465
I scored major points.

1:39:41.535 --> 1:39:42.735
Glad I could help.

1:39:42.805 --> 1:39:44.235
I could use your
help again, though.

1:39:44.305 --> 1:39:45.535
Sure.
Give me your cell.

1:39:45.605 --> 1:39:48.045
- No, actually, it's Mr. Emerson.
- What?

1:39:48.105 --> 1:39:50.315
Ok, so he's inside, super drunk.

1:39:50.385 --> 1:39:52.085
He does not do well
with getting cut off.

1:39:52.155 --> 1:39:53.625
I need to get him into a cab,

1:39:53.685 --> 1:39:55.895
so maybe you can come inside,
persuade him to leave?

1:39:55.955 --> 1:39:57.625
I'll try.

1:40:09.425 --> 1:40:11.625
He's with one of his students.

1:40:11.695 --> 1:40:14.265
Yeah, not sure
what I can do about that.

1:40:39.145 --> 1:40:41.185
Are you kidding me?

1:40:41.245 --> 1:40:44.355
Don't they teach you how to
carry a tray in waitress school?

1:40:47.595 --> 1:40:49.705
Professor.

1:40:51.365 --> 1:40:53.905
Miss Mitchell.

1:40:53.975 --> 1:40:58.215
To what do I owe
this unexpected delight?

1:40:58.285 --> 1:41:01.085
Can you help me get a cab?
I need to go home.

1:41:01.155 --> 1:41:03.065
Of course.
Anything for you.

1:41:03.125 --> 1:41:06.095
And I do mean anything.

1:41:06.165 --> 1:41:08.135
But first, a drink.

1:41:08.205 --> 1:41:09.475
I already have one!

1:41:09.545 --> 1:41:12.015
Does it pair well with couscous?

1:41:12.075 --> 1:41:17.255
I'm sorry. I shouldn't
make fun of your poverty.

1:41:17.325 --> 1:41:19.295
It's past your bedtime.

1:41:19.365 --> 1:41:21.095
You shouldn't be
in a place like this.

1:41:21.165 --> 1:41:22.865
Time to get me home then.

1:41:35.155 --> 1:41:36.825
Okay.

1:41:39.505 --> 1:41:41.165
After you.

1:41:41.235 --> 1:41:42.905
On second thought, I can walk.

1:41:42.975 --> 1:41:45.075
Then I have time
for another drink.

1:41:45.145 --> 1:41:47.685
No! Let's go.

1:42:17.705 --> 1:42:20.915
You picked me up,
you naughty little kitty.

1:42:20.985 --> 1:42:23.755
I didn't pick you up,
I'm dropping you off.

1:42:23.825 --> 1:42:26.395
And if you keep this up,
I will drop you.

1:42:30.335 --> 1:42:33.075
Good night, Professor.

1:42:37.615 --> 1:42:40.755
I've lost my keys.

1:42:46.465 --> 1:42:49.445
But I've found my glasses.

1:43:17.195 --> 1:43:18.865
I feel sick.

1:43:25.875 --> 1:43:30.125
Come on, Professor.
Let's get you to bed.

1:43:31.255 --> 1:43:33.525
What's so funny?

1:43:33.595 --> 1:43:35.565
You, Miss Mitchell.

1:43:35.635 --> 1:43:37.905
You're taking me to bed,

1:43:37.965 --> 1:43:40.775
but you haven't even
kissed me yet.

1:43:40.845 --> 1:43:45.015
Don't you think
we should canoodle first?

1:43:45.085 --> 1:43:47.855
I haven't even had
a chance to pet you,

1:43:47.925 --> 1:43:50.665
you naughty little kitty.

1:43:50.725 --> 1:43:53.935
And you're a virgin, aren't you?

1:43:54.005 --> 1:43:56.505
You've never canoodled
a day in your life.

1:43:56.575 --> 1:44:00.185
I'm taking you to your bedroom
so you can sleep it off.

1:44:00.245 --> 1:44:02.355
- Now come on.
- Then kiss me good night,

1:44:02.415 --> 1:44:06.525
and I'll go to bed
like a good little boy.

1:44:06.595 --> 1:44:09.705
Please don't hurt me.

1:44:11.535 --> 1:44:13.845
Never.

1:44:51.585 --> 1:44:54.055
Beautiful Julianne.

1:45:02.205 --> 1:45:04.845
Sweet like candy.

1:45:36.575 --> 1:45:38.475
I'm sorry, Julianne.

1:45:38.545 --> 1:45:40.415
I'm sorry I was a bad boy.

1:45:40.485 --> 1:45:43.285
It's all right.
Come on.

1:46:02.225 --> 1:46:03.895
Mmm-mm.

1:46:22.495 --> 1:46:24.165
Mmm-mm.

1:46:30.345 --> 1:46:33.085
Are you gonna be
all right for a minute?

1:48:10.385 --> 1:48:15.225
Gabriel, you've
thrown up all over yourself.

1:48:15.285 --> 1:48:18.095
Do you want to
stay like this or...

1:48:28.915 --> 1:48:31.785
Let me.

1:51:06.635 --> 1:51:11.275
Julianne...

1:51:11.345 --> 1:51:13.145
Please don't leave me.

1:51:15.185 --> 1:51:19.125
I'm not going leave you.

1:51:19.195 --> 1:51:21.665
Sleep now.

1:51:59.675 --> 1:52:04.015
Ti amo, Dante.

1:52:04.085 --> 1:52:08.355
Eccomi Beatrice.

1:52:18.875 --> 1:52:20.215
Hello.

1:52:20.285 --> 1:52:22.085
Who the hell is this?

1:52:22.155 --> 1:52:23.385
Who's this?

1:52:23.455 --> 1:52:26.355
It's Paulina.
Put Gabriel on.

1:52:26.425 --> 1:52:30.105
He's, um,
indisposed at the moment.

1:52:30.165 --> 1:52:32.975
Indisposed?
Listen you little slut,

1:52:33.035 --> 1:52:36.345
roll him over and put the phone
in his hand, I'm calling from...

1:52:36.415 --> 1:52:37.745
Please call back tomorrow.

1:52:57.655 --> 1:52:59.355
Beatrice.

1:53:03.295 --> 1:53:06.135
You found me.

1:53:07.275 --> 1:53:10.085
You remember?

1:53:15.255 --> 1:53:19.235
I thought you had forgotten me.

1:53:20.505 --> 1:53:23.545
Never.

1:53:40.075 --> 1:53:43.545
I missed you so much.

1:53:46.215 --> 1:53:48.685
I should have waited.

1:53:51.725 --> 1:53:53.865
I love you.

1:53:56.975 --> 1:54:00.785
I love you so much, it hurts.

1:56:06.935 --> 1:56:09.535
"I'd given up hope,
until you looked

1:56:09.605 --> 1:56:12.715
"into my eyes last night
and finally saw me.

1:56:12.775 --> 1:56:19.325
"Apparuit iam beatitudo vestra.

1:56:19.395 --> 1:56:21.725
Your Beatrice."

1:57:08.355 --> 1:57:09.955
What the hell are you doing?

1:57:17.345 --> 1:57:20.245
I asked you a question!

1:57:20.315 --> 1:57:21.925
What the fuck are you doing
in my clothes?

1:57:21.945 --> 1:57:25.625
Don't you remember last night?

1:57:25.685 --> 1:57:26.895
No, thankfully I don't!

1:57:26.955 --> 1:57:28.895
And get the fuck up
off that floor!

1:57:31.865 --> 1:57:36.845
Don't you dare speak to me
like that, you lousy drunk.

1:57:36.915 --> 1:57:40.325
Who the fuck
do you think you are?

1:57:40.385 --> 1:57:42.055
I should have let
Gollum have you!

1:57:42.125 --> 1:57:45.195
I should have let you
fuck her brains out

1:57:45.265 --> 1:57:47.635
in front of everyone
on top of the bar at Lobby.

1:57:47.705 --> 1:57:50.175
What are... What are you
talking about?

1:57:50.235 --> 1:57:52.975
Hau ab! Verpiss dich!

1:57:54.445 --> 1:57:55.625
How did you learn
to swear in German?

1:57:55.645 --> 1:57:57.585
Bite me, Gabriel!

1:58:05.205 --> 1:58:06.605
What are you doing?

1:58:06.675 --> 1:58:08.045
What does it
look like I'm doing?

1:58:08.105 --> 1:58:10.015
I'm getting the hell
out of here before I take

1:58:10.075 --> 1:58:13.655
one of your stupid bow ties
and strangle you with it!

1:58:42.345 --> 1:58:44.185
Who's Gollum?

1:58:44.245 --> 1:58:46.115
Christa-fucking-Peterson!

1:58:48.285 --> 1:58:49.755
I saved you from fucking her!

1:58:49.825 --> 1:58:51.425
Did you and I have sex?

1:58:51.495 --> 1:58:53.065
In your dreams.

1:58:53.135 --> 1:58:54.665
That's not an answer.

1:58:54.735 --> 1:58:56.685
Of course you would have to
be drunk to want to fuck me.

1:58:56.705 --> 1:58:58.405
Who said anything about fucking?

1:58:58.475 --> 1:59:02.315
Whatever happened,
consider yourself lucky you don't remember.

1:59:02.385 --> 1:59:04.025
Julianne, just please...

1:59:04.085 --> 1:59:06.455
tell me... tell me
I wasn't rough with you.

1:59:06.525 --> 1:59:09.195
You didn't hurt me.

1:59:09.265 --> 1:59:12.035
You wanted someone to put you
to bed and keep you company.

1:59:12.105 --> 1:59:15.745
You were actually
more of a gentleman last night

1:59:15.805 --> 1:59:17.145
than you have been this morning.

1:59:17.215 --> 1:59:19.145
I think I like you better
when you're drunk.

1:59:19.215 --> 1:59:22.695
Julianne, I think
very highly of you.

1:59:22.755 --> 1:59:25.765
You're beautiful,
you're innocent and sweet.

1:59:25.825 --> 1:59:28.905
But what happened
last night can't happen again.

1:59:32.675 --> 1:59:36.015
I apologize for kissing you.

1:59:37.485 --> 1:59:39.225
Oh, that?

1:59:39.285 --> 1:59:41.995
I'd forgotten all about it.
It was nothing.

1:59:43.035 --> 1:59:45.905
I'm just glad I didn't hurt you.

1:59:49.945 --> 1:59:51.615
You hurt me.

1:59:52.415 --> 1:59:54.655
You hurt me.

1:59:59.695 --> 2:00:02.505
Why did you sign the note
the way you did?

2:00:02.565 --> 2:00:05.105
You begged me to come after you.

2:00:05.175 --> 2:00:08.785
To look for you in Hell.

2:00:08.845 --> 2:00:11.155
Well, that's exactly
where I found you,

2:00:11.225 --> 2:00:13.755
and you can stay there
for all I care.

2:00:15.095 --> 2:00:16.935
Beatrice?

2:00:16.995 --> 2:00:20.435
You were my first kiss.

2:00:20.505 --> 2:00:24.285
I fell asleep in your arms
in your precious orchard.

2:00:24.345 --> 2:00:26.285
Beatrice, wait! Wait!

2:00:26.355 --> 2:00:28.685
Wait! Beatrice!

2:00:29.625 --> 2:00:32.195
I'm not your Beatrice anymore.
