00:04.004 --> 00:07.298
And that's why Abbott will
always stay in my heart.

00:08.425 --> 00:10.301
All right, I'll wrap this up.

00:10.385 --> 00:12.929
You know how I can carry on.
Right, Ava?

00:14.097 --> 00:15.724
I know you can, girl.

00:15.724 --> 00:17.600
Oh.

00:17.684 --> 00:19.602
Barbara, thank you
for all your kindness.

00:19.686 --> 00:21.896
Mel, all that
you've done for me.

00:21.980 --> 00:24.065
- I don't know how...
- Who is she again?

00:26.693 --> 00:28.278
I do not know
that woman's name.

00:28.278 --> 00:30.864
No, I know this.
I know this. It's, uh...

00:30.864 --> 00:31.906
Is she a gym teacher?

00:31.990 --> 00:33.700
I don't really mess
with gym teachers.

00:33.700 --> 00:35.702
Their voices never
match their faces.

00:39.039 --> 00:41.207

00:41.291 --> 00:43.126
I cannot believe this is

00:43.126 --> 00:44.627
your last day with us.

00:44.711 --> 00:46.546
I mean, you have been
the greatest

00:46.546 --> 00:48.840
volunteer art teacher
this school has ever seen.

00:48.840 --> 00:49.966
And look.

00:50.050 --> 00:51.801
Bermuda shorts,
because your favorite

00:51.885 --> 00:54.471
vacation spot is Bermuda!

00:54.471 --> 00:55.513
Well, how sweet.

00:55.597 --> 00:57.349
- Mm-hmm.
- Thank you!

00:57.349 --> 00:59.059
- You're so welcome.
- Aww.

01:01.353 --> 01:04.356
Barbara,
what is her name again?

01:22.165 --> 01:23.375
- Janine.
- Yeah?

01:23.375 --> 01:24.584
What's wrong with you?

01:24.584 --> 01:25.877
You psyching yourself up
to be yourself today?

01:25.877 --> 01:27.295
No.

01:27.379 --> 01:30.006
Today, my friend Sahar
is starting.

01:30.090 --> 01:32.801
So, when I heard we needed
a new volunteer art teacher,

01:32.801 --> 01:34.052
I called my friend Sahar.

01:34.052 --> 01:38.139
She's a successful local artist,
and she's so cool.

01:38.223 --> 01:39.349
Check it out.

01:39.349 --> 01:41.393
This is us in college
when we first met.

01:43.395 --> 01:44.771
She never got wine stains
on her teeth.

01:44.771 --> 01:46.147
Ugh, God.
Man, believe it or not,

01:46.231 --> 01:48.024
I had a hard time making friends
back then.

01:48.108 --> 01:49.067
No.

01:49.067 --> 01:50.485
Yeah, yeah, I know.

01:50.485 --> 01:52.737
But Sahar really took me
outside of my box, and,

01:52.821 --> 01:53.863
you know, I'm sure
she's gonna do the same thing

01:53.947 --> 01:55.031
for the kids,
and I don't know.

01:55.115 --> 01:57.200
- If you think I'm cool...
- I don't.

01:57.200 --> 01:59.619
- Janine's cool.
- Yes, thank you, Jacob.

01:59.703 --> 02:00.829
She does puzzles. She knits.

02:00.829 --> 02:02.414
Just thank you, thank you.

02:02.414 --> 02:04.040
She wears orthopedics,
and she eats plums.

02:04.124 --> 02:05.166
What is wrong with plums?

02:05.250 --> 02:07.210
- I mean...
- They're not exactly the coolest fruit.

02:07.210 --> 02:08.878
- You know what's a cool fruit?
- Mm.

02:08.962 --> 02:10.505
- Kiwi.
- Exactly.

02:10.505 --> 02:12.340
Mm. Oh.

02:12.424 --> 02:13.967
Janine!

02:13.967 --> 02:15.468
Oh, my God, Sahar!

02:15.552 --> 02:17.429
- Mwah, mwah.
- Mwah, mwah.

02:17.429 --> 02:18.596
Oh, she French?

02:18.680 --> 02:20.223
Good morning, everyone.
I'm Sahar.

02:20.223 --> 02:23.059
So, you used to hang out
with Janine?

02:23.143 --> 02:24.561
Was it some kind of
big sister thing

02:24.561 --> 02:26.062
or some kind of Make-A-Wish
for people

02:26.146 --> 02:27.564
who are dying of embarrassment?

02:28.732 --> 02:31.443
That is Ava. She's funny.

02:32.152 --> 02:34.029
Well, I'm so excited to be here.

02:34.029 --> 02:35.864
I cannot wait to collaborate.

02:35.864 --> 02:38.199
Okay, let me go
show you around. Come on.

02:39.576 --> 02:42.495
Pulling off overalls?
That's not easy.

02:42.579 --> 02:44.581
I'm telling you, Twitch
is more popular than TV.

02:44.581 --> 02:46.624
More people are actually
watching Twitch than...

02:46.708 --> 02:49.586
Jacob, I am trying to
oversee nutrition here.

02:49.586 --> 02:52.505
Oh, yeah, no, of course. Sorry.

02:52.589 --> 02:55.342
What about you, Devin?
Who's your favorite streamer?

02:55.342 --> 02:56.593
I'm busy, Caillou.

02:56.593 --> 02:58.970
Classic Devin.

02:59.679 --> 03:02.182
I can't believe this is what
they're serving the children.

03:04.642 --> 03:06.936
- Mm-mm-mm.
- Mm-mm-mm.

03:07.020 --> 03:09.814
Budget cuts.
And it gets worse every year.

03:11.316 --> 03:13.109
Are there even any vegetables
in these meals?

03:13.193 --> 03:14.861
Yeah. We got sprouts flown in

03:14.861 --> 03:17.030
from Brussels every morning.

03:17.739 --> 03:19.699
No use getting frustrated
with him.

03:19.783 --> 03:22.994
They're just like us -- doing
the best with what they got.

03:23.078 --> 03:25.622
I saw a NowThis video
about some teachers in Kentucky

03:25.622 --> 03:27.916
who built a vegetable garden
at their school.

03:27.916 --> 03:29.501
We could do something
like that here, I bet.

03:29.501 --> 03:31.461
- We?
- Jacob and Barbara.

03:31.461 --> 03:33.713
<i>♪ The ultimate dream team ♪</i>

03:33.797 --> 03:36.257
Jacob, stuff like that
won't work here.

03:36.341 --> 03:38.134
But -- But it's worked
in other schools.

03:38.218 --> 03:40.303
And -- And the great part is
it would help the kids,

03:40.387 --> 03:42.180
but also we'd get
to be gardening,

03:42.180 --> 03:44.891
which is like
the best thing ever.

03:45.475 --> 03:47.352
Now, that I will agree with.

03:47.352 --> 03:49.062
Oh, my God, are we doing this?

03:50.897 --> 03:53.483
I cannot believe that I'm
about ready to say this, but,

03:53.483 --> 03:55.860
Jacob, let's do this.

03:55.944 --> 03:56.986
Ah!

03:58.113 --> 03:59.072
I know
they're not assigned.

03:59.072 --> 04:01.157
We all understand
who parks where,

04:01.241 --> 04:03.368
and you parked
in my understood spot.

04:03.368 --> 04:04.494
You understand?

04:04.494 --> 04:05.745
Oh, um, she -- she understands.

04:05.829 --> 04:07.080
She got it.

04:07.080 --> 04:09.416
Yeah, I totally --
I -- I'm really sorry.

04:09.416 --> 04:10.709
It won't happen again.
I'm just --

04:10.709 --> 04:12.127
I'm still getting used to
the way the place works.

04:12.127 --> 04:14.504
It's all good.
That's in the past.

04:14.504 --> 04:16.006
Not what I came
to talk about anyway.

04:16.006 --> 04:18.008
Well, it's what
you started with.

04:18.008 --> 04:19.843
I'm joking.

04:19.843 --> 04:21.636
So, what I came to talk about is

04:21.720 --> 04:23.722
this year's Peter Rabbit
project, which...

04:23.722 --> 04:25.849
Oh, oh, oh, it's so great.

04:25.849 --> 04:28.184
You know, every year, both
our classes read <i>Peter Rabbit,</i>

04:28.268 --> 04:30.020
and then, with the art teacher,

04:30.020 --> 04:33.148
the kids make their own versions
of Peter with paper plates.

04:33.148 --> 04:35.191
It's the big art project
of the second grade.

04:35.275 --> 04:36.359
- It's great.
- And this year...

04:36.443 --> 04:37.861
- Mm-hmm?
- ...there's a surprise.

04:39.279 --> 04:41.114
Oh, my goodness.

04:41.114 --> 04:42.282
Are these new?!

04:42.282 --> 04:43.450
You tell me.

04:43.450 --> 04:45.368
Okay, um...no chocolate stains.

04:45.452 --> 04:47.078
No mildew.

04:47.162 --> 04:48.872
Look at this binding tension.

04:48.872 --> 04:49.998
Oh!

04:49.998 --> 04:51.082
How did you get these?

04:51.166 --> 04:52.751
I bought them.

04:54.252 --> 04:56.046
With your own money? No favors?

04:56.046 --> 04:57.505
All me.

04:58.131 --> 05:01.134
Oh, yeah, I've been doing
this project for 15 years.

05:01.134 --> 05:03.553
It's the first thing I did
that the kids really loved.

05:03.553 --> 05:04.596
Um...

05:05.638 --> 05:07.849
This one was from my first year.

05:10.060 --> 05:12.187
I-It's Styrofoam.

05:12.187 --> 05:13.563
I get they're bad
for the environment,

05:13.563 --> 05:15.065
but you try
floating pigs in a blanket

05:15.065 --> 05:17.400
across a hot tub
on a paper plate.

05:17.484 --> 05:19.361
- It's legendary.
- Yeah, you're gonna love it.

05:19.361 --> 05:21.654
We can talk logistics later.

05:21.738 --> 05:23.239
Awesome! Can't wait!

05:23.323 --> 05:25.408
This project
is right up your alley.

05:25.492 --> 05:27.202
Are we sure Peter Rabbit
is the way to go?

05:27.202 --> 05:28.870
- Oop?
- I just wonder if there's maybe

05:28.870 --> 05:31.206
a more relevant story?

05:31.206 --> 05:34.626
Well, Melissa just got
all those new copies.

05:39.255 --> 05:40.465
S-Sahar?

05:41.049 --> 05:42.217
I've got it, and I love it.

05:42.217 --> 05:43.802
- Oh.
- We're gonna elevate the story.

05:43.802 --> 05:46.096
Delve deep beneath the surface
of <i>Peter Rabbit</i>

05:46.096 --> 05:48.223
and uncover the metaphors
hidden in the story.

05:48.223 --> 05:50.892
Oh. Yes. Totally.

05:50.892 --> 05:52.852
Yes. I mean, most people
just think of it

05:52.936 --> 05:55.897
as this story about a rabbit
who steals carrots.

05:55.897 --> 05:58.817
But we're not like most people.
We see subtext.

05:58.817 --> 06:01.695
It's a story about domesticity
and capitalism.

06:01.695 --> 06:04.906
Exactly. That's what
I've always said.

06:04.906 --> 06:06.616
Just wait for me

06:06.700 --> 06:08.118
before you talk to Melissa.

06:08.118 --> 06:09.244
Of course.

06:09.244 --> 06:11.746
This is classic
Janine and Sahar.

06:11.830 --> 06:14.833
I mean, being her friend
is so exciting.

06:14.833 --> 06:17.544
We are just doing a ton
of cool stuff all the time,

06:17.544 --> 06:19.546
like going to a party
at Tierra Whack's house,

06:19.546 --> 06:20.880
which she got to go.

06:20.964 --> 06:22.549
I actually -- I stood outside

06:22.549 --> 06:25.427
and, um, I just listened
because I couldn't get in.

06:25.427 --> 06:26.970
It all sounded so fun.

06:26.970 --> 06:28.722
Everyone was having
a really good time.

06:31.850 --> 06:34.019
Jacob.

06:36.396 --> 06:38.732
Well, would you look at us?

06:38.732 --> 06:42.068
Well, you have fine taste,
Mr. Hill.

06:42.152 --> 06:43.111
- As do you.
- Mm.

06:43.111 --> 06:44.863
You know, the origin of sun hats
is an interesting...

06:44.863 --> 06:46.656
Why don't we just put on
some music?

06:46.740 --> 06:48.825
- Absolutely.
- Mm-hmm.

06:51.995 --> 06:53.788
Is that bossa nova?

06:53.872 --> 06:54.873
Yeah. I-I can change it
if you want.

06:54.873 --> 06:56.041
No, no.

06:56.041 --> 06:58.168
I love it.

06:58.168 --> 07:00.545
- Great.
- Okay.

07:00.545 --> 07:01.838
There you are.

07:01.838 --> 07:03.506
- Thank you.
- I, uh...

07:03.590 --> 07:05.216
I bought some
pre-sprouted plants

07:05.300 --> 07:06.843
to expedite the process.

07:06.843 --> 07:09.179
I thought we could have
a space for veggies

07:09.179 --> 07:10.597
and one for fruits.

07:10.597 --> 07:12.015
Well, you know, I thought
it might also be nice

07:12.015 --> 07:14.225
if we had a section
for flowers, too.

07:14.309 --> 07:16.311
Ah. One step ahead of ya.

07:18.646 --> 07:20.607
Lilies!

07:20.607 --> 07:23.735
Like my favorite movie,
<i>Lilies of the Field.</i>

07:23.735 --> 07:25.570
Ah! You know what?

07:25.570 --> 07:28.573
They just don't make men
like Sidney Poitier anymore.

07:28.573 --> 07:30.658
They -- They don't.

07:30.742 --> 07:32.369
They most certainly do not.

07:34.204 --> 07:36.331
Hey, y'all.
What's happening here?

07:36.331 --> 07:37.916
Jacob and I are starting
a garden

07:37.916 --> 07:39.918
to grow some vegetables
for the students.

07:39.918 --> 07:42.587
Oh, wow. That's really cool.

07:42.671 --> 07:44.381
We got an extra pair of gloves
if you want in.

07:44.381 --> 07:46.716
No, thanks, I'm good.
I mean, I appreciate it, though.

07:46.800 --> 07:49.260
Just the opposite
of green thumbs over here.

07:49.344 --> 07:51.846
In the '60s, my grandfather
started a landscaping business,

07:51.930 --> 07:53.181
Eddie Lawn & Care.

07:53.181 --> 07:55.392
Then, in the '90s,
my father took it over.

07:55.392 --> 07:56.976
Then, for the first 20 years
of my life,

07:57.060 --> 07:59.562
I spent every single
summer "vacation"

07:59.646 --> 08:01.356
planting, mowing, and raking.

08:03.400 --> 08:05.318
I cannot stand gardening.

08:05.402 --> 08:06.861
You don't want to over-water
that one.

08:08.488 --> 08:09.906
From what I've heard.

08:12.492 --> 08:14.077
Amaya, you are
in Jupiter's group.

08:14.077 --> 08:15.620
Stop hoarding Saturn's rings.

08:15.704 --> 08:17.330
What do you mean
by old? Old how?

08:17.414 --> 08:18.832
Like I'm old
or it's old-fashioned?

08:18.832 --> 08:19.916
What -- What old?
No, no.

08:19.916 --> 08:22.502
The project is just
a little elementary.

08:22.502 --> 08:24.713
Of course it's elementary!
This is an elementary school!

08:24.713 --> 08:25.922
Okay, I misspoke. I shouldn't
have said "elementary."

08:26.006 --> 08:26.965
- I'm sorry.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa.

08:26.965 --> 08:29.342
- What's going on?
- Little miss MoMA over here

08:29.426 --> 08:32.178
thinks a beloved tradition
is too "elementary"

08:32.262 --> 08:33.638
for second graders,
so she wants to do

08:33.722 --> 08:36.516
some installation
in the library instead.

08:36.516 --> 08:38.351
I don't not want
to do your project.

08:38.435 --> 08:41.104
I just -- You know, Janine and I
were talking earlier today.

08:41.104 --> 08:43.398
Oh, oh, oh,
you're in on this, too?

08:43.398 --> 08:45.525
Mm, let's all just
take a deep breath

08:45.525 --> 08:46.985
and ask ourselves...

08:46.985 --> 08:48.361
We want to elevate the project.

08:48.445 --> 08:49.404
Could you stop saying "we"?

08:49.404 --> 08:51.031
Okay, we're doing
the bunny plates

08:51.031 --> 08:52.615
like we've always done,

08:52.699 --> 08:54.117
and that's the end
of the discussion.

08:54.117 --> 08:56.327
Janine, get your girl
and tell her to watch out,

08:56.411 --> 08:58.329
because you don't know
who you're messing with.

09:02.042 --> 09:04.878
Okay, so, um,
what I got from that

09:04.878 --> 09:06.212
is you should watch out

09:06.296 --> 09:08.131
and you don't know
who you're messing with.

09:08.131 --> 09:09.716
- Mm.
- Uh...

09:10.842 --> 09:13.386
I am so sorry
that got so intense,

09:13.470 --> 09:15.555
but that's why
I wanted you to wait

09:15.555 --> 09:16.973
for me to talk to Melissa
with you.

09:17.057 --> 09:19.768
No apology necessary.
At least she's passionate.

09:19.768 --> 09:20.935
True, true.

09:21.019 --> 09:23.396
But still, I'm sorry
your art installation project

09:23.480 --> 09:24.856
got shut down.

09:24.856 --> 09:27.275
Oh, we're gonna do
the installation.

09:27.359 --> 09:29.611
Since when have we let
one "no" stop us?

09:29.611 --> 09:30.862
A "no" from Melissa

09:30.862 --> 09:33.698
is like a thousand "no's"
from anybody else.

09:33.782 --> 09:35.575
Melissa's gonna love
the installation.

09:35.575 --> 09:36.701
She just doesn't know it yet

09:36.785 --> 09:38.495
'cause she doesn't
think like us.

09:38.495 --> 09:40.747
- We're wired different.
- Totally, totally.

09:40.747 --> 09:42.374
I think it's
"wired differently," but...

09:42.374 --> 09:43.750
What happened to
the Janine who was

09:43.750 --> 09:46.378
hopping over turnstiles last
year to protest minimum wage

09:46.378 --> 09:47.504
for transit workers?

09:47.504 --> 09:48.963
Actually, I did pay

09:49.047 --> 09:50.882
'cause I couldn't get over
the turnstile

09:50.882 --> 09:52.217
and that's how they get paid,

09:52.217 --> 09:53.677
so it wasn't making sense
as a protest.

09:53.677 --> 09:55.011
Let me ask you this question.

09:55.095 --> 09:56.262
Did you take this job

09:56.346 --> 09:58.264
so that you could be
part of the system

09:58.348 --> 10:01.434
or because
you wanted to inspire...

10:01.518 --> 10:03.019
- What's your name?
- Bria.

10:03.103 --> 10:05.188
...students like Bria
and her friends

10:05.188 --> 10:07.691
to be the next generation
of free thinkers?

10:12.987 --> 10:14.155
You're good.

10:14.239 --> 10:16.282
You know how to
get me fired up. Ha!

10:16.366 --> 10:18.118
But still,
we can't use the library

10:18.118 --> 10:19.452
without Melissa's co-sign.

10:19.536 --> 10:20.829
I mean, it's her project.

10:20.829 --> 10:23.665
What did we do in college when
the TAs gave us unfair grades?

10:23.665 --> 10:26.251
- Cry and accept it?
- Flirt with the professor.

10:27.377 --> 10:29.546
No, I-I -- You did that?

10:29.546 --> 10:31.923
All I'm saying is, we just got
to go over Melissa's head.

10:32.007 --> 10:33.967
<i>She is so right.</i>

10:33.967 --> 10:36.052
Sometimes I forget
why I got into this job,

10:36.136 --> 10:37.679
but Sahar reminded me in a way

10:37.679 --> 10:39.639
where I didn't even know
it was happening.

10:39.723 --> 10:40.765
Just like boom!

10:40.849 --> 10:42.851
So cool.

10:42.851 --> 10:44.269
Actually, you know,
it was my grandmother

10:44.269 --> 10:46.438
that fostered my love
of gardening.

10:46.438 --> 10:47.897
And mischief.

10:49.024 --> 10:51.484
I'm dead. I am dead.

10:53.403 --> 10:54.529
- Oh!
- Ooh!

10:54.529 --> 10:56.489
Great work, buddy!

10:56.573 --> 10:58.366
Aww!

10:58.450 --> 10:59.909
Let's get this
little guy inside.

11:03.455 --> 11:04.414
Crap.

11:04.414 --> 11:06.458
<i>Jacob and Barbara have
no idea what they're doing.</i>

11:06.458 --> 11:08.918
He was trying to plant a coconut
in West Philadelphia

11:09.002 --> 11:11.379
in soil with a sub-6.3 pH.

11:13.548 --> 11:14.507
Bruh!

11:14.591 --> 11:16.885
Devin, my guy, look at this.

11:16.885 --> 11:18.511
What do you suits want?

11:18.595 --> 11:19.554
What's that for?

11:19.554 --> 11:21.014
Eating.

11:21.014 --> 11:22.098
It's a zucchini.

11:22.182 --> 11:23.933
I know what a zucchini is, man.

11:24.017 --> 11:25.518
What do you want me
to do with it?

11:25.602 --> 11:28.313
We are growing vegetables
for the kids in our new garden.

11:28.313 --> 11:29.606
We birthed this.

11:29.606 --> 11:30.732
Oh, you birthed it?

11:30.732 --> 11:32.984
Let me -- Can I? Let me see.

11:33.068 --> 11:34.194
Oh, look, you birthed it.

11:34.194 --> 11:35.236
The baby!

11:36.363 --> 11:38.948
Look at that baby!

11:39.032 --> 11:39.991
Baby Sidney!

11:40.075 --> 11:41.993
The disrespect!

11:42.077 --> 11:44.162
What am I supposed to do
with a twerp squash?

11:44.162 --> 11:45.997
Feed half a kid? Come on, man.

11:46.081 --> 11:48.500
Of course not. That was just
a sample of what's to come.

11:48.500 --> 11:49.834
Once these plants
start blooming,

11:49.918 --> 11:52.253
we're gonna be
swimming in squash.

11:52.337 --> 11:53.838
And then what? We prepare them?

11:53.922 --> 11:55.382
We do not have time.

11:55.382 --> 11:57.050
We're barely getting by as is.

11:57.050 --> 11:59.260
Y'all can make-believe
on your own time.

12:02.430 --> 12:04.849
So, not the reaction
I was hoping for.

12:04.933 --> 12:06.184
Devin's right.

12:07.435 --> 12:09.521
- We're being foolish.
- Barbara!

12:09.521 --> 12:12.982
I cannot believe that
I let myself get carried away.

12:13.066 --> 12:14.150
Projects like this,

12:14.234 --> 12:17.112
they do not work
in public schools.

12:19.364 --> 12:20.907
I pulled a Janine.

12:20.907 --> 12:22.534
I-I still think
there's a way to make...

12:22.534 --> 12:24.035
You -- Mnh-mnh!

12:24.119 --> 12:26.538
- Mnh!
- ...it work.

12:28.748 --> 12:30.792
There's gotta be
a solution here, you know?

12:32.419 --> 12:35.046
Because, you know,
if I have to go into that garden

12:35.130 --> 12:38.341
without my girl Barbara...

12:38.425 --> 12:40.427
Sorry.

12:40.427 --> 12:42.846
Hey, Ava!

12:42.846 --> 12:44.055
What do you think of these?

12:44.139 --> 12:45.640
Oh, wow, those are fun.

12:45.724 --> 12:47.642
Not you, Carlton.
I was asking Sahar.

12:47.726 --> 12:49.769
I agree with Janine.
I think they're so fun.

12:49.853 --> 12:51.646
You have really good taste.

12:51.730 --> 12:55.233
So, Ava, we have
a little favor to ask you.

12:58.695 --> 13:00.196
She not hear me?

13:01.197 --> 13:02.615
You know, Ava...

13:03.533 --> 13:05.410
When I was doing ayahuasca
in Peru,

13:05.410 --> 13:07.078
I was visited
by an Earth goddess

13:07.162 --> 13:10.540
who had the exact same
energy profile as you.

13:10.540 --> 13:12.333
It was beautiful.

13:12.417 --> 13:14.627
Girl, don't you throw up
and poop your pants on that?

13:15.879 --> 13:17.422
You're funny.

13:17.422 --> 13:19.466
Janine and I were wondering
if we could use the library

13:19.466 --> 13:21.593
for a little installation
we're planning.

13:21.593 --> 13:23.219
- Like an art show?
- Kind of.

13:23.303 --> 13:24.262
- It's for the kids.
- Mm-hmm.

13:24.346 --> 13:26.765
It's sort of an elevated version
of Melissa's idea.

13:26.765 --> 13:29.684
Oh, elevated? Hell yeah,
you got my okay on that.

13:29.768 --> 13:30.894
- Great.
- Darling.

13:30.894 --> 13:32.771
Well, have a great day, Ava.

13:32.771 --> 13:34.105
Don't tell me
what kind of day to have.

13:34.189 --> 13:35.899
Getting all presumptuous
and rude.

13:36.608 --> 13:38.026
Hey, Ava,

13:38.026 --> 13:39.736
I hope today shimmers for you.

13:39.736 --> 13:42.489
You know what, Sahar?
I think it will.

13:45.116 --> 13:47.202
Oh, got a little schmutz there.

13:47.202 --> 13:49.954
Oh, a, uh...a kid sneezed on me.

13:52.415 --> 13:54.459
Morning, everyone!
Barbara, look.

13:57.379 --> 13:58.630
Zucchini!

13:58.630 --> 14:00.382
Washed, grilled, ready to eat.

14:00.382 --> 14:02.801
There's no way all that zucchini
came from your garden.

14:02.801 --> 14:04.594
- I assume.
- Assume correctly

14:04.678 --> 14:06.596
you did, Gregory, because
I went to the farmers' market.

14:06.680 --> 14:07.764
I bought a ton of zucchini

14:07.764 --> 14:09.474
and basically stayed up
all night preparing it.

14:09.474 --> 14:10.850
Did you guys know
you're supposed to dilute

14:10.934 --> 14:12.519
cold brew concentrate
with water?

14:12.519 --> 14:14.145
I didn't.

14:14.229 --> 14:15.605
Can't really feel my toes.

14:15.689 --> 14:18.566
So, you stayed up all night
preparing this?

14:18.650 --> 14:21.194
I did. Devin said they didn't
have time to do it, so I did it.

14:22.487 --> 14:25.198
Jacob.

14:25.198 --> 14:26.658
I am really impressed.

14:26.658 --> 14:27.826
Ooh!

14:27.826 --> 14:28.952
You did a real...

14:28.952 --> 14:30.078
<i>- Go, Man, Go?
- Go, Man, Go!</i>

14:30.078 --> 14:31.121
Yes!

14:31.121 --> 14:32.872
What the hell is happening?

14:32.956 --> 14:34.249
There's more in my car.

14:34.249 --> 14:36.876
Melissa, I think
you're going to love

14:36.960 --> 14:38.086
what the kids and I
have created.

14:38.086 --> 14:39.671
There better be
paper-plate bunnies.

14:39.671 --> 14:41.673
Oh, there are definitely
paper-plate bunnies.

14:41.673 --> 14:43.049
There are
paper-plate bunnies, right?

14:43.133 --> 14:45.010
There are paper-plate bunnies.

14:45.010 --> 14:46.970
And more than that,
there's passion.

14:46.970 --> 14:48.972
Let the experience begin.

14:48.972 --> 14:50.181
Yeah, okay.

14:57.439 --> 14:59.024
Wow!

14:59.024 --> 15:02.235
Guys, this is just great work!

15:02.235 --> 15:03.737
- Oh, my goodness!
- Great work!

15:03.737 --> 15:05.864
Wow, these look so good.

15:05.864 --> 15:07.699
Oh, my gosh.

15:07.699 --> 15:10.326
We all worked very hard
on our bunnies,

15:10.410 --> 15:13.413
so we thought it was only right
to give them a home.

15:17.125 --> 15:19.127
- Oh, my gosh.
- Oh, wow.

15:19.127 --> 15:20.712
Sahar!

15:20.712 --> 15:23.923
I don't usually explain
my art to other people,

15:24.007 --> 15:26.384
and I'm sure you already
totally get it.

15:26.468 --> 15:28.053
Yeah, no, couldn't be clearer.

15:28.053 --> 15:32.057
Sahar, I got to hand it to you,
this is wonderful.

15:32.057 --> 15:34.726
My thesis was
to break societal norms

15:34.726 --> 15:37.062
by creating and destroying
all at once,

15:37.062 --> 15:40.398
using what held us back
to propel us forward.

15:40.482 --> 15:42.400
Yeah, I mean,
that's how you got to do it.

15:48.031 --> 15:49.949
- Sahar.
- Mm-hmm?

15:50.033 --> 15:51.534
What is this garden
made of?

15:51.618 --> 15:53.161
Oh, that's the best part.

15:53.161 --> 15:55.580
It's made out of
the <i>Peter Rabbit</i> books.

16:03.630 --> 16:04.756
Niecy.

16:07.884 --> 16:10.053
- Yeah, it'll work.
- For what?

16:10.053 --> 16:12.847
To brutally bludgeon
your friend.

16:12.931 --> 16:14.307
Why are you reacting this way?

16:14.391 --> 16:15.809
The project was gorgeous.

16:15.809 --> 16:18.645
Sahar, you ruined
the books she bought.

16:18.645 --> 16:20.397
- Mm-hmm.
- You all don't understand.

16:20.397 --> 16:22.232
The whole project
was about pushing boundaries.

16:22.232 --> 16:24.651
How about I push the boundaries
of your head with this book?!

16:24.651 --> 16:25.777
No!

16:27.612 --> 16:29.280
All right.

16:33.952 --> 16:35.954
Sahar, this project was about

16:35.954 --> 16:38.123
the kids practicing
their fine motor skills

16:38.123 --> 16:39.457
in a creative way.

16:39.541 --> 16:40.625
You took this way too far.

16:40.709 --> 16:41.876
There's no such thing.

16:41.960 --> 16:44.421
And we can just get more books.
It's not hard.

16:44.421 --> 16:46.089
It is hard, actually.

16:46.089 --> 16:49.050
Then I'll use some of my money
to create a personal grant

16:49.134 --> 16:51.052
so that the school can
get more relevant books

16:51.136 --> 16:52.220
than <i>Peter Rabbit.</i>

16:52.220 --> 16:53.555
What is your problem
with <i>Peter Rabbit?</i>

16:53.555 --> 16:54.889
It's just been done.

16:54.973 --> 16:56.516
It's done for a reason.

16:56.516 --> 16:57.976
Are there even any
bunnies of color in it?

16:57.976 --> 16:59.477
The kids like it, okay?

16:59.561 --> 17:01.146
Just because a bunch
of people like something

17:01.146 --> 17:02.355
doesn't make it bad.

17:02.439 --> 17:03.398
Eh.

17:03.398 --> 17:05.316
Sahar, we owe
Melissa an apology.

17:05.400 --> 17:07.485
Wow. I knew it.

17:07.569 --> 17:09.654
- I knew you were one of them.
- One of who?

17:09.738 --> 17:11.781
A conductor of mediocrity
and conformity.

17:11.865 --> 17:13.283
You know, I thought
it was so cool

17:13.283 --> 17:14.784
that you worked in an
underprivileged school,

17:14.868 --> 17:16.077
but now I see that
you don't even care

17:16.161 --> 17:18.079
about inspiring the kids.

17:18.163 --> 17:20.373
You know what? I hate to say it,

17:20.457 --> 17:22.167
but I think you're
a conventional thinker.

17:24.586 --> 17:26.129
You know what?

17:26.129 --> 17:27.380
You can get out.

17:27.464 --> 17:29.758
Actually, Janine,

17:29.758 --> 17:30.967
I'm gonna go.

17:31.051 --> 17:32.886
And, by the way, I lied.

17:32.886 --> 17:35.263
You are swimming
in that sweater.

17:37.724 --> 17:38.683
Yeah, well,

17:38.767 --> 17:40.393
your real name is Sarah!

17:40.477 --> 17:42.771
I saw it in your
birth certificate collage!

17:43.563 --> 17:44.606
Just don't.

17:44.606 --> 17:45.732
Did the art show start?

17:45.732 --> 17:46.941
Did I miss the step and repeat?

17:48.068 --> 17:50.570
Melissa, I had no idea
she was gonna do that.

17:50.570 --> 17:51.654
I am so s--

17:51.738 --> 17:55.325
No, don't you dare apologize.
I'm proud of you.

17:55.325 --> 17:57.619
You did the right thing
kicking that wannabe Zoe Kravitz

17:57.619 --> 17:59.454
- out of here.
- You kicked Sahar out?!

17:59.454 --> 18:02.290
Aw, man, Janine!
What's her handle?

18:02.374 --> 18:05.251
I have no idea why you were
friends with her to begin with.

18:05.335 --> 18:07.545
Look, I mean,

18:07.629 --> 18:10.965
without Sahar, college
wouldn't have been fun for me.

18:11.049 --> 18:13.259
She made me feel like

18:13.343 --> 18:16.554
I fit in somewhere being myself.

18:16.638 --> 18:18.765
She made being an outcast cool.

18:18.765 --> 18:22.560
Being a real person is
more important than being cool.

18:23.395 --> 18:25.021
And you're a real person.

18:26.940 --> 18:30.235
Who owes me 75 copies of
<i>Peter Rabbit</i> before next year.

18:30.235 --> 18:34.239
Okay, if you guys are finished
with this very special episode,

18:34.239 --> 18:35.740
Janine, can you shoot me
Sahar's number?

18:35.824 --> 18:37.242
I'm tryin' to go out
this weekend.

18:40.161 --> 18:42.247
Just what I need --
a man who wears used pants

18:42.247 --> 18:43.623
bringing me a tray of pickles.

18:43.707 --> 18:46.126
Devin, Jacob stayed up
all night long

18:46.126 --> 18:48.920
preparing this zucchini
for the children's lunches.

18:49.754 --> 18:51.297
We realize how difficult

18:51.381 --> 18:52.590
- your day must be.
- Mm.

18:52.674 --> 18:54.759
You work under
stressful conditions,

18:54.843 --> 18:57.429
and you still provide
for hundreds of kids a day.

18:57.429 --> 19:01.182
And I am sorry
for insulting your food.

19:01.266 --> 19:03.309
I am sure it's...great.

19:03.393 --> 19:05.937
I appreciate that.
And it is great.

19:06.021 --> 19:08.273
- You should try some.
- Oh, I have.

19:08.273 --> 19:10.066
No, not with
this new microwave we got.

19:10.150 --> 19:11.526
These things is piping hot.

19:11.526 --> 19:13.153
Go ahead. Give it a try.

19:14.070 --> 19:15.030
Yeah.

19:16.990 --> 19:18.366
Yeah? Yeah?

19:23.246 --> 19:25.415
Mmm. Tater tots.

19:25.415 --> 19:26.958
Oh, that's a chicken nugget.

19:27.042 --> 19:28.418
Ooh.

19:28.418 --> 19:30.837
Anyways, here it is,
all ready to serve.

19:30.837 --> 19:32.464
Oh, yep.

19:32.464 --> 19:34.799
Ooh.

19:34.883 --> 19:36.092
That's a
health-code violation.

19:36.176 --> 19:38.178
I can't be serving food
y'all made at home.

19:39.429 --> 19:41.014
Go ahead,
get some more nuggets.

19:46.728 --> 19:47.854
How'd you get those?

19:47.854 --> 19:50.982
I think the what is more
important than the how here.

19:51.066 --> 19:53.818
I obviously could not afford
to buy the books myself,

19:53.902 --> 19:55.153
so I had to get creative.

19:55.153 --> 19:57.322
So, what you see here
is a commentary

19:57.322 --> 20:00.825
on both domesticity
and capitalism.

20:00.909 --> 20:04.162
Uh, as well as socialism
and sexism.

20:04.162 --> 20:06.623
If you think about it
for a second,

20:06.623 --> 20:07.749
carrot.

20:08.666 --> 20:09.751
Or not.

20:10.627 --> 20:12.545
It's up to the eye
of the beholder

20:12.629 --> 20:14.297
of the person who has the eye.

20:14.381 --> 20:15.924
<i>I reached out
to some art collectors</i>

20:15.924 --> 20:17.926
<i>who notoriously
have money to burn.</i>

20:17.926 --> 20:19.427
I sold the art installation

20:19.511 --> 20:22.430
and had enough money
to replace the books.

20:22.514 --> 20:24.099
Pretty cool.

20:27.185 --> 20:29.354
Oh, why would you
put that together?

20:31.356 --> 20:32.399
Power clashing.

20:33.525 --> 20:34.901
Okay.

20:37.320 --> 20:40.365
Okay, you are gonna flip
when you see. Go.

20:42.826 --> 20:44.411
Ohh.

20:44.411 --> 20:47.038
It's breathtaking!

20:47.122 --> 20:49.290
It's like our own
little Pandora.

20:49.374 --> 20:50.583
You know how like
in <i>Avatar</i> when...

20:50.667 --> 20:51.835
No.

20:51.835 --> 20:53.795
It's okay. I guess
we don't have to like

20:53.795 --> 20:55.588
all the same things
all the time.

20:59.676 --> 21:01.428
- Oh.
- Oh. Uh, let's go.

21:03.179 --> 21:04.222
Yes!

21:10.520 --> 21:11.938
<i>Oh, they were
absolutely killing everything.</i>

21:12.022 --> 21:14.315
I don't think a single seed
would have survived.

21:14.399 --> 21:16.234
I couldn't just sit there
and watch that.

21:16.234 --> 21:17.777
It's like my dad always said.

21:17.861 --> 21:20.030
"A real man doesn't ignore
the root of the problem.

21:20.030 --> 21:21.656
Now pick that hoe up!"

21:24.325 --> 21:26.578
I hate gardening so much.

21:28.747 --> 21:31.666
