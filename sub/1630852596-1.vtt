01:28.520 --> 01:32.319
<i>Once upon a time a
beautiful young girl grew up</i>

01:32.400 --> 01:35.840
<i>hidden away in a convent
by the edge of the sea.</i>

01:36.587 --> 01:37.827
Marie-Josephe!

01:39.320 --> 01:40.642
Marie-Josephe!

01:42.400 --> 01:45.119
<i>Her very existence was a secret.</i>

01:45.200 --> 01:48.120
<i>For she was the King's daughter.</i>

01:49.520 --> 01:50.719
Marie-Josephe!

01:50.800 --> 01:54.760
<i>From a very early age,
she was drawn to the water.</i>

01:55.564 --> 01:58.637
<i>Much to the dismay of
the convent's strict nuns</i>

01:58.718 --> 02:01.598
<i>who did their best to shelter her
from the world.</i>

02:02.540 --> 02:05.603
How often have you been
warned not to swim in the sea?

02:06.403 --> 02:07.719
Very often.

02:07.800 --> 02:10.239
And to my previous punishments--

02:10.320 --> 02:12.902
Revoking your riding privileges,

02:12.983 --> 02:15.623
burning your beloved cello,
none were enough to detour you.

02:17.200 --> 02:20.119
It is Satan's voice which
calls you to the unholy sea.

02:20.200 --> 02:23.580
No… Abbess, it is
a simple joy of nature.

02:23.661 --> 02:26.105
-Silence. Silence, I said!
-It is.

02:31.880 --> 02:36.519
<i>Meanwhile, at the Palace of
Versailles, Marie-Josephe's father,</i>

02:36.600 --> 02:40.263
<i>King Louis XIV, King of France,</i>

02:40.344 --> 02:43.340
<i>had recently returned
victorious from an expensive war</i>

02:43.421 --> 02:45.444
<i>that had dragged on for years.</i>

02:46.440 --> 02:51.480
Our troops have been fighting
with exceptional skill and courage.

02:54.251 --> 02:56.440
It has been the greatest honor for me

02:57.250 --> 02:59.010
to stand beside each--

03:03.880 --> 03:05.534
France still had enemies.

03:05.615 --> 03:06.497
My King…

03:06.578 --> 03:10.039
And that night, the man
also known as the Sun King,

03:10.120 --> 03:13.640
learned that even he
would not live forever.

03:25.240 --> 03:26.240
Now…

03:26.800 --> 03:27.880
Where was I?

03:32.120 --> 03:33.640
A few inches to the right,

03:35.080 --> 03:36.715
would have found your heart.

03:36.796 --> 03:38.462
If France loses you,

03:39.676 --> 03:41.119
it would be catastrophic.

03:41.200 --> 03:43.231
Not to mention lonely for me.

03:44.022 --> 03:45.515
There is a possible solution.

03:46.600 --> 03:49.771
I've been investigating
certain properties…

03:50.560 --> 03:52.280
of an organ in a legendary sea creature.

03:52.789 --> 03:53.829
A fish?

03:54.680 --> 03:56.120
That's your solution?

03:58.040 --> 03:59.840
If the question is the king's mortality,

04:01.157 --> 04:02.877
this creature could hold the key.

04:05.800 --> 04:09.839
<i>And with that, the Sun King
commissioned a risky expedition</i>

04:09.920 --> 04:13.239
<i>to find the
underwater lost City of Atlantis.</i>

04:13.320 --> 04:15.200
<i>And its fabled mermaids.</i>

04:16.232 --> 04:19.632
<i>Believing they held the key
to life everlasting.</i>

04:19.720 --> 04:21.160
<i>Hold tight o', captain.</i>

04:21.240 --> 04:22.516
Give me some hand with this.

04:22.600 --> 04:25.956
<i>For this dangerous mission,
a courageous captain</i>

04:26.040 --> 04:29.120
<i>was sent to search the
far reaches of the seas.</i>

04:42.514 --> 04:43.720
I think I saw it.

04:44.360 --> 04:45.360
Due North.

04:46.680 --> 04:47.959
Are you sure?

04:48.040 --> 04:50.279
Only if you believe in the unbelievable.

04:51.800 --> 04:53.560
Ready the barrel!

04:54.680 --> 04:56.040
Ready the barrel.

05:01.440 --> 05:02.520
Lower the nets!

05:04.560 --> 05:06.040
Drop the boat, now!

05:07.760 --> 05:09.160
Fire!

05:09.560 --> 05:10.560
Fire!

05:17.200 --> 05:18.640
Heave!

05:23.720 --> 05:25.080
Heave!

05:26.280 --> 05:27.280
Up!

05:39.240 --> 05:40.680
They're gonna kill us all!

05:44.760 --> 05:46.480
We only need the female.

05:48.160 --> 05:49.600
Let the male go.

05:57.200 --> 05:59.876
<i>So, Captain Yves De La Croix</i>

05:59.960 --> 06:03.436
<i>sent word of the amazing
capture back to Versailles,</i>

06:03.520 --> 06:06.288
<i>on the wings of the Royal carrier pigeons.</i>

06:18.760 --> 06:20.919
Fantastic news, Your Majesty!

06:21.000 --> 06:23.520
De La Croix's ship sails for home.

06:24.320 --> 06:26.880
In possession of the miraculous cargo.

06:27.840 --> 06:29.919
The coming eclipse is the perfect timing.

06:30.000 --> 06:31.959
The books are clear about these matters.

06:32.040 --> 06:34.338
And specify that the creature
must be sacrificed

06:34.419 --> 06:36.492
right as the moon passes
in front of the sun

06:36.573 --> 06:39.479
in order to transfer
its gift of eternal life.

06:39.560 --> 06:42.135
Perhaps we should withhold
our glee, Dr. Labarthe,

06:42.216 --> 06:44.839
until we have the proof that
your books are not just fiction.

06:44.920 --> 06:46.556
Relax, father.

06:46.637 --> 06:51.919
Surely the doctor wouldn't be risking his
reputation on these outlandish claim

06:52.000 --> 06:54.344
unless he was feeling very confident.

07:00.979 --> 07:02.331
Dead ahead, Captain!

07:07.920 --> 07:09.922
<i>The King's closest minister</i>

07:10.003 --> 07:13.959
<i>had serious doubts about the
doctor's plan for the mermaid.</i>

07:14.040 --> 07:17.079
<i>And as fate would have
it he had just requested</i>

07:17.160 --> 07:22.639
<i>that the King's daughter attend the royal
celebration of the coming solar eclipse.</i>

07:22.720 --> 07:26.519
Father? A response
from the Convent of St Elein.

07:26.600 --> 07:28.313
Give me the girl's files.

07:33.446 --> 07:36.290
It seems the Abbess can't wait
to grant us our request.

07:39.600 --> 07:44.935
<i>And on the next day, Father La Chaise went
to retrieve the King's long lost daughter.</i>

07:45.016 --> 07:48.578
<i>Thus starting Marie-Josephe's
great adventure.</i>

07:49.640 --> 07:51.799
She's become incurably defiant.

07:51.880 --> 07:53.426
Immune to all discipline.

07:53.507 --> 07:57.439
Now reports over the years
have told of a prodigious musical talent

07:57.520 --> 07:59.959
so poised in devotion to God.

08:00.040 --> 08:02.548
Throughout her childhood, yes.
But she's become--

08:02.629 --> 08:03.709
Dear Abbess…

08:04.483 --> 08:08.479
I need to know whether her
talents might be welcomed…

08:08.560 --> 08:09.872
in court.

08:23.497 --> 08:25.497
You are leaving us, Marie-Josephe.

08:30.076 --> 08:31.359
Where am I going?

08:31.440 --> 08:33.818
To a lavish and glimmering hell.

08:34.840 --> 08:37.720
Where you will no doubt thrive.

08:54.120 --> 08:55.559
Do you serve the King?

08:55.640 --> 08:58.640
No, I work for the King.

09:00.600 --> 09:02.000
I serve God.

09:03.296 --> 09:05.576
Are you taking me to meet the King or God?

09:17.882 --> 09:19.842
I've always heard the tales of Versailles.

09:21.480 --> 09:23.719
Never imagined
it would be quite so…

09:23.800 --> 09:25.160
Magnificent?

09:25.866 --> 09:27.106
It's definitely dreams.

09:40.581 --> 09:42.101
Magali, please.

09:49.600 --> 09:51.855
Marie-Joseph D'Alember.

09:53.120 --> 09:55.399
-This is Magali.
-Bonjour.

09:55.480 --> 09:57.207
Please show her to her room.

09:58.845 --> 10:00.765
No, we're not in the chateau.

10:01.715 --> 10:02.835
This way, Mademoiselle.

10:06.828 --> 10:08.908
Sire, it is the hour.

10:15.180 --> 10:16.969
Boring!

10:17.680 --> 10:20.399
I could write better music than that.

10:20.480 --> 10:23.612
Maybe you should compose
your own music, Your Majesty.

10:23.693 --> 10:25.839
Maybe I should be my own priest.

10:25.920 --> 10:29.120
Find me a composer who is fresh, fighting.

10:31.443 --> 10:32.327
No hurry.

10:32.408 --> 10:34.319
No hurry, meaning?

10:34.400 --> 10:35.498
Immediately.

10:40.499 --> 10:42.069
Shall we start our day?

10:48.499 --> 10:50.919
Forgive me Father for I have sinned.

10:51.000 --> 10:54.741
I shared my bed last night
with Madame Scarron.

10:55.437 --> 10:56.405
Devereaux.

10:57.320 --> 10:59.119
It was Madame Devereaux.

10:59.200 --> 11:00.839
I don't think so.

11:00.920 --> 11:02.255
Devereaux is an intellectual.

11:03.020 --> 11:04.731
She is also a brunette.

11:07.840 --> 11:09.879
Forgive me Father for I have sinned.

11:09.960 --> 11:13.240
I shared my bed last night
with Madame Devereaux.

11:14.160 --> 11:15.520
You should be forgiven.

11:19.200 --> 11:22.526
To have earned private quarter
so quickly is a magnificent feat.

11:22.607 --> 11:24.129
I doubt I've earned anything.

11:25.400 --> 11:28.197
Humility will get you nowhere
at court, Mademoiselle.

11:28.278 --> 11:30.973
Color and bravado
are the order of the day.

11:32.280 --> 11:34.863
Look at those girls.
I don't fit in here.

11:36.040 --> 11:37.760
It's my job to see that you will.

11:56.780 --> 11:59.059
All ladies' chambers face east.

11:59.874 --> 12:02.754
So that each awakens with
a ray of the King on her cheek.

12:04.763 --> 12:07.483
It's the last piece she wrote
at the convent, your Majesty.

12:08.482 --> 12:12.199
I am not the one to judge whether
or not her skills are good enough.

12:12.280 --> 12:13.817
She's not without talent.

12:14.640 --> 12:17.378
And remember she has no formal training.

12:17.459 --> 12:20.380
I am speaking of talent,
the stuff one is made of.

12:21.280 --> 12:22.639
I will meet her tomorrow.

12:22.720 --> 12:25.920
And remember, no one must know,
she is my daughter.

12:32.843 --> 12:34.959
So how long were you at the convent?

12:35.040 --> 12:37.719
Since birth. I never knew my parents.

12:37.800 --> 12:40.888
Were you taken from them
like I was from Mom?

12:40.969 --> 12:41.831
No.

12:43.244 --> 12:44.324
I was left there.

12:45.337 --> 12:46.617
How poetic.

12:47.320 --> 12:51.880
Trauma at the start of life
often inspires greatness.

12:53.440 --> 12:57.197
Sometimes I think the trauma was greater
for the Abbess than it was for me.

13:02.544 --> 13:03.457
Your Majesty,

13:03.538 --> 13:07.271
first honor this morning is bestowed
on Monsieur Jean-Michel Lintillac,

13:07.352 --> 13:10.977
son of the lace and export's baron,
Pierre Lintillac.

13:13.457 --> 13:16.079
I feel a sense of awe standing
here in the lights of the Sun King.

13:16.160 --> 13:19.959
-A light cast for all France.
-For all France!

13:20.040 --> 13:21.799
I come to show my gratitude…

13:21.880 --> 13:25.039
Our nations gratitude for your
recent military triumph.

13:25.120 --> 13:26.700
It is the God's triumph.

13:27.480 --> 13:28.480
And…

13:29.400 --> 13:31.159
Our brave soldiers.

13:31.240 --> 13:34.286
In honor of your upcoming birthday,
Your Majesty, let me offer this gift.

13:35.204 --> 13:37.284
My father's dearest possession.

13:38.141 --> 13:40.141
Forged from rare Chinese diamonds.

13:42.149 --> 13:44.359
How I dislike birthdays.

13:44.440 --> 13:46.080
They remind me of mortality.

13:46.640 --> 13:50.319
They also remind you of your
soul's immortality, Your Majesty.

13:50.400 --> 13:53.799
I'm not worried about my soul.
Well, not just yet.

13:53.880 --> 13:57.079
So tell me, how is your dear father?

13:57.160 --> 13:59.245
He's ready to pass from
this world to the next.

13:59.925 --> 14:00.925
I see.

14:03.451 --> 14:06.428
Perhaps there's more to do with the boy.

14:07.643 --> 14:08.639
Meaning.

14:08.720 --> 14:10.938
This war has depleted the treasury.

14:11.019 --> 14:14.362
Why don't we just turn the boy upside down
and see what falls from his pockets?

14:14.443 --> 14:16.679
He stands to inherit a fortune.

14:16.760 --> 14:18.879
You are being secretive and enigmatic.

14:18.960 --> 14:21.510
An inappropriate
behaviour for anyone but me.

14:22.800 --> 14:24.960
Do you believe in coincidence?

14:26.396 --> 14:27.556
Or fate?

14:30.720 --> 14:32.452
Why is everyone staring?

14:33.085 --> 14:34.680
Appearance is everything.

14:35.292 --> 14:37.772
-Appearance?
-Yes, Mademoiselle.

14:38.360 --> 14:40.652
They would rather gossip about you

14:40.733 --> 14:43.319
than reflect on the
emptiness of their own lives.

14:43.400 --> 14:46.840
Being kicked out of a convent
is hardly the making of a fairy tale.

14:47.440 --> 14:51.559
Perhaps, but the fact
that the king had you brought here

14:51.640 --> 14:53.959
makes you an object of intrigue.

14:54.040 --> 14:58.344
Second only to some secret surprises he
has planned for the coming solar eclipse.

14:59.025 --> 15:01.104
The King owns the eclipse too, does he?

15:02.720 --> 15:04.759
I guess when one rules
over the moon and the sun,

15:04.840 --> 15:06.640
he is entitled to schedule
their rendezvous.

15:17.840 --> 15:21.679
-Do you have a favorite fountain?
-Yes, the Fountain Flora.

15:21.760 --> 15:23.285
It's right over there.

15:34.360 --> 15:35.880
Isn't she beautiful?

15:45.520 --> 15:46.720
Mademoiselle, be careful.

15:51.440 --> 15:52.440
Mademoiselle!

15:53.720 --> 15:54.720
The King!

16:09.788 --> 16:11.760
Allow me, Mademoiselle.

16:19.520 --> 16:24.500
Marie-Josephe. Present yourself
before the King, if you please.

16:38.160 --> 16:41.960
Might you remove that shock
from your face and offer a smile?

16:54.082 --> 16:56.082
Do you have a genuine smile?

16:57.473 --> 16:58.673
Hidden somewhere?

17:00.876 --> 17:02.366
No regrets, mademoiselle.

17:02.447 --> 17:06.166
That statue is of a woman who has
caused many to lose their balance.

17:09.164 --> 17:10.164
Although…

17:11.280 --> 17:12.280
mostly men.

17:19.359 --> 17:21.116
No need to bother, mademoiselle.

17:21.200 --> 17:22.554
I have another one.

17:24.867 --> 17:27.468
Move her to quarters
befitting my new composer.

17:41.240 --> 17:42.920
Have we died and gone to heaven?

17:43.578 --> 17:45.138
It think so.

17:46.160 --> 17:48.879
We are now in the chateau,

17:48.960 --> 17:51.386
among the truly privileged.

17:52.520 --> 17:55.433
And I have been appointed
your lady in waiting.

17:57.691 --> 18:00.011
It's all so magnificent.

18:04.640 --> 18:07.720
If you could choose only one,
which would it be?

18:10.494 --> 18:12.374
They are all so beautiful.

18:13.600 --> 18:14.600
But…

18:16.160 --> 18:17.560
I choose my cello,

18:18.760 --> 18:19.760
my freedom.

18:54.040 --> 18:55.040
-Steady!
-Hold it!

19:08.956 --> 19:11.519
The King built all of this,

19:11.600 --> 19:14.037
bring water to Versailles from
the ocean via the Seine.

19:14.560 --> 19:17.709
Those are a system of valves
that regulate the various fountains.

19:18.560 --> 19:20.490
And there is the path to
the underground river.

19:21.425 --> 19:23.146
Brings all the water here.

19:24.040 --> 19:26.959
After the male was returned to the sea,

19:27.040 --> 19:30.719
the female fell into a
dark and lethargic trance.

19:30.800 --> 19:32.813
A seaman's drunken commentary.

19:34.440 --> 19:35.759
There were two of them?

19:35.840 --> 19:39.719
Yes, your majesty, but the male
is useless for our purpose.

19:39.800 --> 19:42.399
Only the female possesses
the infinite light source.

19:42.480 --> 19:45.919
What you propose,
doctor, is sacrilegious.

19:46.000 --> 19:49.597
-What I'm proposing is revolutionary.
-Stop the bickering. Stop it.

19:52.800 --> 19:55.310
I want to see the creature,
as soon as possible.

19:55.391 --> 19:56.940
Yes, Your Majesty.

20:03.497 --> 20:05.439
If this is real, we need it.

20:05.520 --> 20:08.254
Which means we need him.

20:08.335 --> 20:11.046
Why are you so anxious
to make him your enemy?

20:11.127 --> 20:12.822
Self respect, perhaps.

20:12.903 --> 20:16.479
My immortality secures
the future of France.

20:16.560 --> 20:19.697
The only thing God gives you as immortal

20:19.778 --> 20:24.480
is your soul and you only have one
of those to lose.

20:28.760 --> 20:30.447
There must be something you will eat.

20:32.016 --> 20:33.016
Captain!

20:34.241 --> 20:35.559
Bring out the creature!

20:35.640 --> 20:37.430
That's easier said than done, sire.

20:38.084 --> 20:41.201
She remains in the bottom,
weakened and traumatized from her journey.

20:42.317 --> 20:43.877
You speak as if it was human.

20:44.520 --> 20:46.319
Cannot speak to such things, father.

20:46.400 --> 20:47.979
I only meant she behaves like a human.

20:48.060 --> 20:49.639
She's rebellious, she won't eat.

20:49.720 --> 20:51.485
It's as if she's lost the will to live.

20:52.360 --> 20:53.400
Interesting.

20:53.960 --> 20:56.261
Do you think it chooses to die?

20:56.342 --> 20:59.839
Nonsense. The creature's condition
is unacceptable.

20:59.920 --> 21:01.559
It must be brought to health at once.

21:01.640 --> 21:04.439
You are the doctor, I am a sailor.

21:04.520 --> 21:07.759
Perhaps you should remember that,
before you speak with such insolence.

21:07.840 --> 21:09.079
Captain Yves,

21:09.160 --> 21:13.439
Do you understand that the creature
is the centerpiece of the celebration?

21:13.520 --> 21:15.079
-Yes, sire.
-Good.

21:15.160 --> 21:19.239
Then see to its full and robust
recovery in time for the eclipse.

21:19.320 --> 21:23.199
In return you shall receive
a royal pardon.

21:23.280 --> 21:25.253
-Majesty.
-However,

21:26.308 --> 21:27.588
you fail me,

21:28.440 --> 21:32.036
and a dark cell will seem like paradise.

21:32.120 --> 21:33.385
I promise.

23:31.098 --> 23:33.799
What are you doing?
No one is allowed in here.

23:33.880 --> 23:36.079
-What is that--
-I ask the questions, not you.

23:36.160 --> 23:38.495
-Now answer me.
-It called me here.

23:39.040 --> 23:40.040
Who called you?

23:40.680 --> 23:42.390
The creature, in the water.

23:43.210 --> 23:46.170
-She called?
-Yes, with her music.

23:46.941 --> 23:48.021
Can't you hear it?

23:48.682 --> 23:50.343
I heard noise like

23:50.427 --> 23:52.747
a dolphin or a whale,
but certainly not music.

23:59.240 --> 24:02.072
I want to use her song in my music.

24:02.720 --> 24:05.480
So that the King and the whole
world can hear in it what I do.

24:06.275 --> 24:07.315
I'm not sure

24:07.880 --> 24:09.920
which one of you is the more peculiar.

24:46.560 --> 24:49.399
She has green eyes,
hair almost like ours.

24:49.480 --> 24:51.480
And she called me from my chamber.

24:52.040 --> 24:54.919
A beautiful hairy fish called
you from your chamber?

24:55.000 --> 24:56.840
No, no. Not a fish.

24:57.480 --> 25:00.399
I think she is a mermaid.
Like in the books.

25:00.480 --> 25:02.242
Her music inspired this.

25:02.323 --> 25:04.839
Don't fret, moussieres.

25:04.920 --> 25:07.680
A woman's soul is as musical as a man's.

25:08.733 --> 25:12.811
With perhaps, a touch more vibrato.

25:23.760 --> 25:26.520
Sir, it is the hour.

25:33.333 --> 25:34.773
A touch of melancholy.

25:42.410 --> 25:44.535
Like nothing I've ever heard before.

25:44.616 --> 25:47.599
Seems both off this world and another.

25:47.680 --> 25:50.365
Invite our young composer to the ball.

25:55.907 --> 25:57.947
Forgive me Father for I have sinned.

26:04.520 --> 26:05.520
Yes?

26:06.840 --> 26:10.960
I can't remember the exact
details of what happened last night.

26:13.989 --> 26:16.269
I understand. You're forgiven.

26:20.996 --> 26:24.596
At the convent we used to pretend to put
a makeup for an imaginary grand ball.

26:25.240 --> 26:28.520
Mademoiselle, you spoil things.
Don't speak.

26:30.980 --> 26:32.380
Now…

26:33.120 --> 26:34.760
Prepare to dazzle.

26:41.427 --> 26:42.636
Magali!

26:42.736 --> 26:43.865
What's wrong?

26:44.920 --> 26:46.199
I look like a clown!

26:46.280 --> 26:49.240
Nonsense, that's how all
the ladies will be painted.

26:49.836 --> 26:52.099
Oh then maybe I'd rather look like a man.

26:52.180 --> 26:53.780
That's also how the men will look.

27:28.600 --> 27:29.760
Your Majesty,

27:30.360 --> 27:32.159
may I present a somewhat

27:32.240 --> 27:34.747
different version
of mademoiselle D'Alembert.

27:35.880 --> 27:39.138
I like this unique look of yours.

27:39.987 --> 27:42.479
-Perhaps others will follow.
-Oh, I doubt it.

27:42.560 --> 27:44.919
You are something they can never be.

27:45.000 --> 27:46.200
An individual.

27:47.177 --> 27:49.737
In all things, I suspect.

27:51.131 --> 27:52.531
Including your music.

27:53.387 --> 27:54.467
I need your help.

27:55.140 --> 27:56.140
Excuse me, Mademoiselle.

27:58.920 --> 28:02.599
I need a brilliant suite for
the celebration of the eclipse.

28:02.680 --> 28:05.799
Something regal, something spiritual…

28:05.880 --> 28:09.865
- Something befitting Apollo.
- And the Sun King?

28:11.596 --> 28:12.959
Monsieur Lintillac.

28:13.040 --> 28:16.299
Perhaps you can offer to dance
with this young mademoiselle.

28:16.380 --> 28:17.408
I would be honored.

28:17.489 --> 28:19.719
The two newest members of the court,

28:19.800 --> 28:23.799
one, the dashing son of the
France's wealthiest merchant,

28:23.880 --> 28:27.999
And an orphan, recently
freed from a convent defined by

28:28.080 --> 28:29.649
humility and chastity.

28:29.730 --> 28:32.099
Then I must humbly ask
whether such a virtuous young lady

28:32.180 --> 28:33.644
would even know how to dance.

28:36.199 --> 28:39.199
I'm afraid, Your Majesty,
I wouldn't know where to begin.

28:39.280 --> 28:42.720
Well then, mademoiselle.
Allow me to take the lead.

28:43.680 --> 28:46.080
A minuet. Three quarter time.

28:54.760 --> 28:58.322
Down, up, down, up…

29:00.869 --> 29:03.200
Now, kick. That's it. Beautiful.

29:03.831 --> 29:06.853
And away. Yes, to me. A spin.

29:07.560 --> 29:09.840
Beautiful. And Kick…

29:11.600 --> 29:13.080
And kick.

29:17.680 --> 29:20.585
And up… And turn around…

29:20.666 --> 29:23.928
Well, and hold, that's it.

29:24.009 --> 29:25.199
Back.

29:25.280 --> 29:27.199
And down.

29:27.280 --> 29:29.522
Now away.

29:30.616 --> 29:31.678
To me.

29:33.763 --> 29:34.974
And here we go.

29:51.611 --> 29:52.971
I am so sorry.

29:54.226 --> 29:55.506
You did fine, my dear.

29:57.491 --> 29:58.611
She is very beautiful.

30:00.000 --> 30:02.080
What she is, is an opportunity.

30:04.459 --> 30:06.339
This one I don't fully understand yet.

30:08.200 --> 30:10.520
Everyone, come and enjoy the fireworks!

30:28.516 --> 30:30.159
It was so amazing.

30:30.240 --> 30:32.759
The King is the most graceful dancer.

30:32.840 --> 30:34.584
You would have loved the fireworks.

30:35.433 --> 30:36.913
It was so spectacular.

30:43.760 --> 30:45.480
Something about you scares her.

30:47.000 --> 30:49.640
Perhaps it's because
you're feeding her dead fish.

30:50.600 --> 30:53.920
-She told you that?
-Of course. Who else?

30:57.499 --> 30:58.899
Who else indeed?

31:00.426 --> 31:01.999
This place is so beautiful.

31:02.080 --> 31:03.200
I love the water.

31:05.212 --> 31:06.665
You don't seem to be afraid of it.

31:08.476 --> 31:10.159
You don't seem to be afraid of anything.

31:10.240 --> 31:13.240
Definitely not water.
I grew up by the sea.

31:14.000 --> 31:17.319
It was the only place I could
go to escape the prison of my convent.

31:17.400 --> 31:19.273
I feel the same way about Versailles.

31:20.228 --> 31:23.879
Out there, beyond that gate,
is a sailor's favorite sight.

31:23.960 --> 31:26.275
The shore line
disappearing in the distance.

31:26.840 --> 31:30.356
Not knowing what's coming next,
other than grand adventure.

31:30.869 --> 31:32.189
Sounds wonderful.

31:35.036 --> 31:36.319
Have you ever been to sea?

31:36.400 --> 31:37.649
Only in my dreams.

31:38.299 --> 31:40.459
The Abbess considered
even swimming a crime.

31:41.028 --> 31:42.028
A crime?

31:42.627 --> 31:45.067
- Against who?
- Against God.

31:48.376 --> 31:51.119
The life force has been confirmed.

31:51.200 --> 31:54.438
As I predicted,
it emanates from the heart.

31:57.023 --> 31:58.822
Once the water has been drained,

31:58.903 --> 32:01.556
the creature will be killed
and the organelle removed,

32:02.801 --> 32:04.921
placing the life force into our hands.

32:11.053 --> 32:15.053
It's a lovely dress.
Interesting. With your eyes.

32:17.930 --> 32:19.530
I have never seen anything like it.

32:20.141 --> 32:22.381
It is wonderful to be here
with someone again.

32:24.111 --> 32:26.111
A completely different experience.

32:27.954 --> 32:31.394
I understand you have
company here from time to time.

32:32.482 --> 32:33.482
A rumor.

32:34.178 --> 32:38.061
Odd in a court so devoid of gossip.

32:38.756 --> 32:40.100
It doesn't make it false.

32:42.420 --> 32:45.540
The statue in the fountain
where you fell in…

32:46.450 --> 32:49.279
That was the last woman
who was here with me in the garden.

32:49.360 --> 32:51.535
-Who is she?
-I used to draw her.

32:52.795 --> 32:54.035
I'm not very good.

32:55.365 --> 32:57.725
Her name was Louise de Valiere.

32:58.880 --> 33:02.481
-Do I remind you of her?
-No one reminds me of her.

33:04.190 --> 33:05.190
Till you.

33:08.430 --> 33:10.879
I'm afraid I've abused my authority…

33:10.960 --> 33:13.639
I questioned some
of the nuns at your convent.

33:13.720 --> 33:14.800
The ones you liked.

33:15.400 --> 33:18.600
-Well, there's such a thing as privacy.
-Oh, I shouldn't think so.

33:19.369 --> 33:21.174
They tell me that you like to ride

33:21.255 --> 33:23.084
and are fascinated by spiders,

33:23.165 --> 33:26.319
which is strange, because they
terrified you as a young girl

33:26.400 --> 33:29.480
-after one bit you in the leg.
-You can't possibly know that.

33:30.179 --> 33:31.499
I'm a King, you know?

33:32.520 --> 33:36.066
And kings have a way of
knowing absolutely everything.

33:45.926 --> 33:49.026
You have made a pledge of
two million livre.

33:50.036 --> 33:52.719
That's a hefty sum, sir,
even for a duchy.

33:52.800 --> 33:55.152
The cost is too great
to honor my father's life.

33:55.923 --> 33:59.488
I see no reason to place the duchy
into the ground with your father.

34:00.102 --> 34:02.422
The title "Duke de Lintillac"

34:03.267 --> 34:04.867
should remain alive

34:06.200 --> 34:07.320
as yours.

34:08.891 --> 34:12.652
I am touched beyond words, Your Majesty.

34:24.777 --> 34:26.914
You didn't tell me this fisherman was so

34:27.800 --> 34:29.039
So…

34:29.120 --> 34:31.520
-Handsome?
-Exactly.

34:34.920 --> 34:37.159
The creature seems to have recovered,
Your Majesty.

34:37.795 --> 34:39.795
It will be in perfect health
for the ceremony.

34:48.436 --> 34:50.438
Good servants of France.

34:50.520 --> 34:54.201
In memory of the export
baron, Pierre Lintillac,

34:54.840 --> 34:58.120
who has found safe passage
to the kingdom of heaven,

34:58.746 --> 35:03.306
I present to you his son,
the future Duke de Lintillac.

35:04.107 --> 35:06.827
Whose title shall be bestowed by me

35:07.461 --> 35:11.461
in my supreme celebration
of the solar eclipse.

35:12.654 --> 35:14.122
For all France!

35:14.203 --> 35:15.760
For all France!

35:17.709 --> 35:21.049
One barracuda is gruesome enough.

35:21.130 --> 35:23.599
Ten will curdle your toes.

35:23.680 --> 35:27.199
We hit a pod of 300 big ones.

35:27.280 --> 35:31.080
Meaner than a slam boon
of drunken musketeers.

35:32.429 --> 35:34.519
They were ramming the hull.
Bang!

35:34.600 --> 35:36.679
Forcing us onto the rocks.

35:36.760 --> 35:40.199
And just as they were about
to tear through the planks--

35:40.280 --> 35:41.419
How frightening.

35:41.500 --> 35:44.298
Now you'll be telling us you
tore them apart with your bear teeth.

35:44.954 --> 35:46.674
We turned sail and
beat them with the wind.

35:47.963 --> 35:48.963
The easy way.

35:49.852 --> 35:51.732
I think it's the clever way out.

35:52.720 --> 35:56.044
A man who fails to kill his prey
is either a weakling or a coward.

35:56.125 --> 35:58.845
And a man who sees
only two choices is a fool.

35:59.960 --> 36:02.840
-You're worthless commoner.
-And you merely behave like one.

36:04.080 --> 36:05.080
That's enough!

36:07.162 --> 36:08.162
Calm.

36:10.280 --> 36:11.439
Your Majesty.

36:11.520 --> 36:13.920
Forgive me, Your Majesty.
It was all my fault.

36:14.659 --> 36:16.979
Serve the sixth course. Play on.

37:34.720 --> 37:36.240
Marie-Josephe!

37:42.800 --> 37:44.456
You should not be swimming in there.

37:45.635 --> 37:47.498
Her tail is sharp enough
to cut through stone.

37:47.579 --> 37:49.019
Luckily I'm not made of stone.

37:57.021 --> 37:58.701
No, I suppose you're not.

38:04.777 --> 38:05.777
Good shot!

38:09.276 --> 38:10.916
Why do you hate him so much?

38:12.200 --> 38:14.279
I used to sell lace to China
for his father.

38:14.360 --> 38:17.159
On our last voyage, the Chinese
refused to pay for half

38:17.240 --> 38:20.880
so our soon to be duke accused me
of stealing and had had me arrested.

38:21.560 --> 38:24.439
Shame isn't it?
When lies obscure the truth.

38:24.520 --> 38:26.670
Seems to be the way
things work around here.

38:26.751 --> 38:27.668
Not with you.

38:28.409 --> 38:29.529
You say what you think.

38:30.260 --> 38:31.260
As do you.

38:31.796 --> 38:33.956
Yes. And it gets me in trouble.

38:52.080 --> 38:53.360
So you can ride!

38:53.880 --> 38:55.520
Perhaps better than you!

39:32.045 --> 39:33.645
The arm is badly broken.

39:35.267 --> 39:37.012
I'm afraid we're going
to have to amputate.

39:37.552 --> 39:38.419
No.

39:38.500 --> 39:40.479
The bone will not heal itself,
mademoiselle.

39:40.560 --> 39:42.536
This is the prescribed procedure.

39:43.187 --> 39:45.279
Father, please,

39:45.360 --> 39:47.040
don't let him take my arm.

39:48.251 --> 39:50.011
God will protect me.

39:50.600 --> 39:54.039
Put her arm back in the sling doctor
and review her condition in the morning.

39:54.120 --> 39:55.734
You are out
of your element here, father?

39:55.815 --> 39:59.497
If we don't act, the infection
will result in the loss of life.

39:59.578 --> 40:00.658
Act how?

40:02.710 --> 40:03.713
Your Majesty.

40:03.794 --> 40:05.440
He wants to take my arm.

40:05.996 --> 40:09.959
Surely, we can review the situation in the
morning before taking such drastic action.

40:10.040 --> 40:11.520
-I'm not sure--
-Hold your silence.

40:20.480 --> 40:21.480
May I?

40:28.280 --> 40:31.440
Life is filled with suffering, my child.

40:32.480 --> 40:34.880
And you have suffered with such grace.

40:35.860 --> 40:37.020
Just rest.

40:39.360 --> 40:40.360
Get out of there.

40:51.520 --> 40:52.800
God is with her.

40:53.960 --> 40:55.800
Even better than science.

41:37.080 --> 41:38.360
Monsieur Yves.

41:42.210 --> 41:43.370
She's not well.

41:45.120 --> 41:47.840
The mermaid. She wants to help.

41:48.997 --> 41:49.997
She told you?

41:50.809 --> 41:51.809
Who else?

41:53.080 --> 41:54.640
The fish also speaks to you?

41:55.440 --> 41:58.200
Well, in a manner of speaking, yes.

42:03.520 --> 42:07.000
If anything happens,
I'll never forgive myself.

42:08.480 --> 42:10.120
Imagine how I would feel.

43:16.840 --> 43:19.400
Could she possibly have healed so quickly?

43:20.788 --> 43:22.788
Apparently she is capable of anything.

43:24.560 --> 43:27.120
She produced a golden light, Your Majesty.

43:27.760 --> 43:29.519
And I could breathe underwater.

43:29.600 --> 43:32.359
Incontrovertible proof, Your Majesty.

43:32.440 --> 43:33.440
Proof?

43:34.432 --> 43:39.334
I assume, mademoiselle, you have heard of
the extraordinary powers of the creature.

43:39.415 --> 43:41.134
I agree that something has occurred here

43:41.215 --> 43:43.677
but what is not yet clear,
you're speaking of fables.

43:43.758 --> 43:46.079
Everything is a fable until proven true.

43:46.160 --> 43:48.479
And now the creature has chosen you

43:48.560 --> 43:50.923
as the first to experience
her healing powers.

43:51.004 --> 43:52.924
Don't call her a creature.

43:53.600 --> 43:56.167
She has a soul, just the same as you.

43:56.248 --> 43:58.359
Nonsense. She is a creature.

43:58.440 --> 44:00.275
And her purpose is to serve the court.

44:01.520 --> 44:04.239
Is that why she's here,
are you ill and in need of a cure?

44:04.320 --> 44:07.127
-I must be excused.
-Sit, father.

44:10.338 --> 44:11.658
No one's ill, child.

44:12.560 --> 44:17.114
Your new friend is here to herald a brand
new day for all the servants of France.

44:19.080 --> 44:22.360
You are the most
wonderful and generous monarch.

44:30.564 --> 44:34.044
By using the mermaid's power to heal
the common people of France.

44:35.635 --> 44:37.755
You have earned your place in eternity.

44:39.320 --> 44:40.320
Well,

44:41.440 --> 44:43.040
as long as it's earned.

44:43.569 --> 44:46.756
And once she has completed
this wonderful task,

44:47.320 --> 44:48.600
will you then set her free?

44:51.600 --> 44:54.120
Her life shall be what God intends.

44:55.120 --> 44:57.639
The mermaid was brought
here for the King, not for France,

44:57.720 --> 45:00.026
just as I was and just as you were.

45:00.546 --> 45:02.186
I have more faith in him than you do.

45:02.756 --> 45:05.079
Perhaps, but you are too naive.

45:05.160 --> 45:06.683
And you are too cynical.

45:08.307 --> 45:10.556
With all due respect, mademoiselle,

45:10.640 --> 45:11.811
what do you know of the world

45:11.895 --> 45:13.975
that you've not seen from
the window of a convent?

45:14.825 --> 45:16.876
Please do not assume that

45:16.960 --> 45:20.280
that I have not lived as broadly as you
that I have not lived as deeply.

45:21.200 --> 45:23.967
Besides, one day I will see the world.

45:25.640 --> 45:26.800
I believe you will.

45:28.185 --> 45:29.285
I meant no offense.

45:42.127 --> 45:44.923
I thought you were going to show
me a different side of Versailles?

45:45.004 --> 45:46.720
I am. Look.

45:50.763 --> 45:53.427
What are people saying about the
mystery of the King's common girl?

45:54.587 --> 45:56.747
Well, common girl, maybe.

45:58.110 --> 46:00.190
Rumor has it she has ties to the King.

46:01.240 --> 46:02.240
What kind of ties?

46:03.040 --> 46:04.320
That is still a mystery.

46:10.800 --> 46:11.800
Mademoiselle!

46:21.680 --> 46:24.239
That's the fishermen's house
where Benoit and I live.

46:24.320 --> 46:25.440
It's so sweet.

46:26.120 --> 46:27.120
Sweet?

46:28.320 --> 46:30.480
Sweet is not a word used for fishermen.

46:31.516 --> 46:34.159
Dashing, courageous, fearless,

46:34.240 --> 46:35.240
not sweet.

46:39.905 --> 46:41.998
-You have a lighthouse?
-I'm afraid so.

46:42.735 --> 46:44.055
It's only a few more steps.

46:49.800 --> 46:51.400
The sight is so beautiful.

46:54.320 --> 46:55.320
Yes, but…

46:55.941 --> 46:59.159
But out there, beyond the horizon,
where the river meets the sea,

46:59.240 --> 47:00.244
that's where--

47:00.325 --> 47:02.480
Every sailor gets his last look at France.

47:07.760 --> 47:10.865
I can see you now,
at the helm of your ship.

47:11.553 --> 47:13.073
Sailing into the sunset.

47:15.204 --> 47:16.484
That's my dream.

47:17.320 --> 47:19.000
Sail away from all this.

47:22.120 --> 47:23.200
What's your dream?

47:25.965 --> 47:28.085
I want the mermaid to return to her home.

47:28.678 --> 47:31.207
-She's certainly not of this world.
-Nor am I.

47:32.404 --> 47:33.764
I want to go with her.

47:34.799 --> 47:35.799
To go with her?

47:38.200 --> 47:39.200
Not really but,

47:39.760 --> 47:41.080
I could swim in her light.

47:41.817 --> 47:43.577
And I'd outrun the fastest ship.

47:45.826 --> 47:48.266
One day I will have you
on the bow of my ship.

47:50.000 --> 47:52.560
We will race the mermaid
and see who's the fastest.

48:03.419 --> 48:05.779
Come, there's more to see.

48:16.480 --> 48:18.759
This is amazing. What is it?

48:18.840 --> 48:20.480
It's called the Temple of Love.

48:23.127 --> 48:24.927
Built in honor of an woman, unnamed.

48:28.320 --> 48:29.418
Rumor is that--

48:42.080 --> 48:44.174
Thank you for receiving me, Your Majesty.

48:44.255 --> 48:47.705
There is something I must
ask for, humbly. Respectfully.

48:47.786 --> 48:51.479
But first, permit me to ask
something of you.

48:51.560 --> 48:53.236
Something for France.

48:53.874 --> 48:56.154
Anything, Your Majesty, even my life.

48:57.003 --> 48:59.083
It's something a little less drastic.

49:00.290 --> 49:06.122
I want you to accept the hand of my
daughter, Marie-Josephe, in marriage.

49:08.961 --> 49:09.961
I'm overwhelmed.

49:10.920 --> 49:13.240
This would be an honor.

49:14.200 --> 49:15.200
Good.

49:16.073 --> 49:16.965
Well.

49:17.520 --> 49:19.564
Since you obviously
weren't listening at the door,

49:19.645 --> 49:21.279
you must be completely in the dark.

49:21.360 --> 49:22.360
Utterly.

49:24.927 --> 49:27.727
-What do you think?
-Does she love Lintillac?

49:28.730 --> 49:31.250
Does it actually matter to you?

49:33.122 --> 49:34.282
Am I so…

49:35.080 --> 49:37.719
endlessly and infinitely self-centered?

49:37.800 --> 49:38.840
It's worse.

49:39.875 --> 49:41.930
Your power is so complete

49:43.129 --> 49:46.049
you're never allowed to care about anyone.

49:47.748 --> 49:49.348
And it's rather terrible.

49:52.571 --> 49:54.891
-What are you doing?
-She called me.

50:50.125 --> 50:52.021
I never knew I could feel like this.

50:52.102 --> 50:55.024
Mademoiselle, stars in
your eyes becoming you.

50:56.196 --> 50:57.199
Father.

50:57.280 --> 51:00.083
Something amazing has happened,
I was just coming to tell you.

51:00.164 --> 51:01.373
Later, little one.

51:02.115 --> 51:03.820
The King has asked to see you.

51:05.493 --> 51:07.253
You will step forward slowly.

51:08.600 --> 51:09.600
And quietly.

51:15.828 --> 51:18.148
Do you recall our
conversation in the garden?

51:19.236 --> 51:20.839
About the woman of the fountain?

51:20.920 --> 51:22.920
Yes, of course. The only woman--

51:24.981 --> 51:26.381
You remind me so much of her.

51:27.920 --> 51:30.000
At times I think you are her.

51:32.011 --> 51:33.011
You are

51:34.235 --> 51:36.115
the very spirit of your mother.

51:39.123 --> 51:40.203
My mother?

51:41.867 --> 51:44.667
She had a mind and spirit, all her own.

51:46.378 --> 51:48.378
She was an individual.

51:51.402 --> 51:53.082
She was not made for court life.

51:55.196 --> 51:56.356
Any more than you are.

52:01.960 --> 52:05.000
She left with the convent
before I knew she was with child.

52:08.876 --> 52:11.156
She died giving birth.

52:18.278 --> 52:19.719
You are my father.

52:19.800 --> 52:20.800
Yes.

52:24.858 --> 52:26.499
But I am a terrible man.

52:27.411 --> 52:29.411
A very selfish man.

52:30.680 --> 52:34.840
I have cared more for France
than about you, or even her.

52:37.516 --> 52:38.639
Why are you telling me this?

52:38.720 --> 52:43.200
Because there are sacrifices
you must make for France.

52:44.476 --> 52:45.639
Sacrifice?

52:45.720 --> 52:48.279
Our country's treasury is empty.

52:48.360 --> 52:49.914
Enemies surround us.

52:50.473 --> 52:51.817
Lies, treachery.

52:52.480 --> 52:53.760
We need money, child.

52:54.891 --> 52:56.703
The young Duke Lintillac…

52:57.360 --> 52:59.909
His money, when you marry him…

52:59.990 --> 53:00.999
No! No!

53:01.080 --> 53:03.529
I won't marry that man! I won't!

53:03.610 --> 53:05.560
You don't have to agree, child.

53:08.956 --> 53:10.756
You have to obey.

53:18.117 --> 53:19.117
Of course…

53:20.808 --> 53:21.808
Your Majesty.

53:34.040 --> 53:35.040
For all France.

54:12.120 --> 54:15.480
I prayed every night
as a little girl

54:16.321 --> 54:17.801
for a mother and father.

54:19.130 --> 54:22.090
And now I wish my prayers
had never been answered.

54:23.899 --> 54:26.699
You must stop
hoping for a perfect world.

54:28.368 --> 54:29.808
And we live in this one.

55:44.024 --> 55:46.384
You understand things, don't you?

55:53.440 --> 55:55.439
I have experienced something.

55:55.520 --> 55:58.316
The mermaid has touched
the very fabric of my being.

56:00.440 --> 56:03.023
Only God can grant us immortality,

56:03.104 --> 56:06.859
unless you believe that
he has bestowed power on you.

56:06.940 --> 56:10.609
I believe he's bestowed on me
the power to discover.

56:10.690 --> 56:12.519
I'm speaking of the soul.

56:12.600 --> 56:13.815
I love the King!

56:14.760 --> 56:17.359
By murdering an
intelligent being in his name,

56:17.440 --> 56:20.072
you are committing him
to eternal damnation.

56:23.554 --> 56:25.474
Go back to your monastery, priest.

56:27.841 --> 56:29.321
Worry about your own soul.

56:30.100 --> 56:31.620
And stay out of my way.

57:18.320 --> 57:19.840
I'm no more free than you are.

58:01.560 --> 58:03.040
Heave!

58:13.160 --> 58:14.160
No!

58:30.785 --> 58:32.719
Everything is in order, Your Majesty.

58:32.800 --> 58:35.199
The creature is in
peak condition for the procedure.

58:35.280 --> 58:36.719
Good. Talk me through.

58:36.800 --> 58:38.280
-Yes.
-Your Majesty…

58:40.305 --> 58:42.410
I can no longer keep silence.

58:43.071 --> 58:44.359
How unlike you.

58:44.440 --> 58:46.836
Sit, father.

58:49.520 --> 58:50.930
I know your feelings.

58:51.011 --> 58:55.159
You are contemplating
the greatest mortal sin.

58:55.240 --> 58:57.959
This is not about sin, it's about science.

58:58.040 --> 59:01.719
Science is not absolute, Your Majesty.

59:01.800 --> 59:07.179
"He who searches the hearts of men,
will know the mind of the spirit."

59:07.260 --> 59:09.250
Thank you for your nice line of scripture

59:09.331 --> 59:12.839
but unless you've talked to God,
I don't believe you know his will.

59:12.920 --> 59:17.682
Perhaps not, but I do know that
immortality is the province of God alone.

59:17.763 --> 59:21.359
Then who placed the mermaid
in the sea for us to capture?

59:21.440 --> 59:25.519
Who called upon me to carry out
his vision of a supreme France?

59:25.600 --> 59:29.003
Do not confuse divine right
and divine guidance.

59:29.084 --> 59:31.927
Then let him decide matters.

59:34.546 --> 59:37.706
Command me, oh, Heavenly Father,

59:39.131 --> 59:41.879
strike me down here and now

59:41.960 --> 59:45.840
if I am about to commit a mortal sin.

59:54.107 --> 59:55.439
Now father…

59:55.520 --> 59:58.880
If my communion with the
creature gives me eternal life…

01:00:00.418 --> 01:00:01.560
It will be God's will.

01:00:25.200 --> 01:00:26.200
Carry on.

01:01:50.047 --> 01:01:51.040
Benoit…

01:01:55.605 --> 01:01:56.800
They are going to kill her.

01:01:58.200 --> 01:01:59.840
We need to warn Marie-Josephe.

01:02:11.560 --> 01:02:14.560
Tomorrow a new age
will dawn for all but us.

01:02:23.160 --> 01:02:26.720
-You need to make a diversion.
-I do. I do?

01:02:28.110 --> 01:02:29.230
I do.

01:02:36.120 --> 01:02:37.120
Mousierre.

01:02:39.173 --> 01:02:41.573
Halt! Come back here!

01:03:00.920 --> 01:03:03.840
-Doctor, I was hoping to--
-Save your breath, De La Croix.

01:03:08.865 --> 01:03:12.966
You were in enough trouble, but sneaking
around the room of the King's daughter,

01:03:13.817 --> 01:03:15.337
now, that's a capital offense.

01:03:17.763 --> 01:03:18.923
Lock him up for the night.

01:03:21.680 --> 01:03:22.680
Kick him.

01:03:57.880 --> 01:04:00.760
There will be no music this morning.
Leave your instruments.

01:04:04.408 --> 01:04:06.315
It is the hour, sir.

01:04:14.640 --> 01:04:17.560
You cannot kill the mermaid!
I won't let you!

01:04:18.596 --> 01:04:20.036
You won't let me?

01:04:20.120 --> 01:04:22.084
Didn't the Abbess teach you any manner?

01:04:22.184 --> 01:04:23.479
Here is my offer.

01:04:23.560 --> 01:04:26.774
You return her to the sea and
I will consent to this marriage.

01:04:26.855 --> 01:04:29.994
You can't haggle with your King
like some shopkeeper.

01:04:30.760 --> 01:04:34.279
I can scarcely believe I was so blind
as not to see this moment coming.

01:04:34.360 --> 01:04:37.759
You swim with her, you commune with her,
she is your pet.

01:04:37.840 --> 01:04:40.359
No! She is all but human!

01:04:40.440 --> 01:04:43.143
She feels her life just as we feel ours.

01:04:43.224 --> 01:04:44.224
Maybe so.

01:04:44.940 --> 01:04:48.120
But you are the one
who has proven the doctor right.

01:04:49.836 --> 01:04:52.319
You think I want this
for my own immortality?

01:04:52.400 --> 01:04:54.582
France needs a leader
who can protect her.

01:04:54.663 --> 01:04:57.151
This is ridiculous! This is murder!

01:04:57.232 --> 01:04:59.319
-Silence!
-Silence to you, father!

01:05:11.705 --> 01:05:13.345
Your wedding is today.

01:05:14.945 --> 01:05:16.145
Be ready.

01:05:20.640 --> 01:05:21.757
Musketeers!

01:05:34.720 --> 01:05:35.999
Who is getting married today?

01:05:36.080 --> 01:05:38.743
Mademoiselle D'Alembert
is to marry Monsieur Lintillac.

01:05:40.440 --> 01:05:41.680
Marie-Josephe?

01:05:53.480 --> 01:05:57.680
Mademoiselle, you must calm down
and prepare for the wedding.

01:06:04.447 --> 01:06:08.133
Magali, please go call Pere La Chaise
to come hear my confession.

01:06:12.960 --> 01:06:15.658
You will do exactly as
you've been ordered.

01:06:16.459 --> 01:06:18.322
Or you shall forfeit your life.

01:06:20.217 --> 01:06:21.417
Drain the water.

01:06:33.820 --> 01:06:37.020
Killing the mermaid will damn his soul
rather than save it.

01:06:38.035 --> 01:06:39.879
You are the only one who can stop him.

01:06:39.960 --> 01:06:41.858
-I can't.
-Yes, yes you can.

01:06:41.939 --> 01:06:44.259
Sorry, I have tried.

01:06:45.155 --> 01:06:46.759
The King has ruled for so long

01:06:46.840 --> 01:06:50.480
he believes he's been given
permission by the Almighty.

01:06:50.561 --> 01:06:53.420
Then free me from this chamber
so I may bid the mermaid farewell.

01:06:54.474 --> 01:06:56.767
The King has forbidden for the contact.

01:06:56.848 --> 01:07:00.320
Which is why I'm asking you.
No, I'm begging you, Father,

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:02.360
please help me.

01:07:04.250 --> 01:07:05.570
Forget what's proper.

01:07:06.315 --> 01:07:07.435
And do what's right.

01:07:15.220 --> 01:07:17.260
My reasons may be different from yours…

01:07:20.080 --> 01:07:22.080
But the mermaid must escape the King.

01:07:29.461 --> 01:07:31.781
No one will believe you
are going to a wedding

01:07:33.628 --> 01:07:34.948
dressed like that.

01:07:45.364 --> 01:07:46.724
My dearest Magali,

01:07:48.938 --> 01:07:50.498
you have been a true friend.

01:07:52.253 --> 01:07:53.573
I will miss you greatly.

01:07:54.613 --> 01:07:55.973
I am frightened for you.

01:07:58.360 --> 01:08:00.120
Weren't you the one who told me

01:08:01.040 --> 01:08:03.840
that a little trauma
can inspires greatness?

01:08:06.680 --> 01:08:08.000
It was just kidding.

01:08:21.002 --> 01:08:22.559
I'm taking the girl to confession.

01:08:22.640 --> 01:08:24.560
I have orders to hold
her here until the wedding.

01:08:25.380 --> 01:08:30.046
And you dare challenge me?

01:09:25.760 --> 01:09:28.680
This is a kiss I've always thought
I'd give to my father.

01:09:35.319 --> 01:09:37.479
God has graced you with wings.

01:09:39.880 --> 01:09:41.520
I only hope you know how to fly.

01:10:05.881 --> 01:10:06.961
Secure the rope.

01:10:07.925 --> 01:10:09.005
Hoist the net.

01:10:13.059 --> 01:10:15.379
What? We haven't got all day.

01:10:16.800 --> 01:10:17.800
Benoit.

01:10:25.512 --> 01:10:28.719
-You can't possibly be doing this.
-We do what he says.

01:10:28.800 --> 01:10:30.923
Whether we end up in the
Bastille or marry for money,

01:10:31.004 --> 01:10:32.129
we do as are told.

01:10:32.210 --> 01:10:34.159
I would never let him sentence me.

01:10:34.240 --> 01:10:35.346
Why would you?

01:10:36.516 --> 01:10:37.999
I swam with her last night.

01:10:38.080 --> 01:10:40.966
She conveyed to me
that you were her captor.

01:10:41.629 --> 01:10:43.469
Did you know you took her from her child?

01:10:44.400 --> 01:10:46.740
-No.
-But you knew of her mate?

01:10:46.821 --> 01:10:48.079
Yes, and we set him free.

01:10:48.160 --> 01:10:51.519
Then you owe her the right
to return to whatever family she has left.

01:10:51.600 --> 01:10:53.119
And have my men face the gallows.

01:10:53.200 --> 01:10:54.808
I'm not asking them.

01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:57.516
I'm asking you.

01:10:57.600 --> 01:11:01.520
What makes you desire to sail the sea more
important than her right to live there?

01:11:02.580 --> 01:11:05.580
-The King justifies everything?
-You mean your father.

01:11:06.483 --> 01:11:07.683
I mean the King.

01:11:09.340 --> 01:11:10.700
Are you no better than him?

01:11:11.562 --> 01:11:12.562
You said…

01:11:13.200 --> 01:11:14.880
the King can't sentence me.

01:11:16.360 --> 01:11:17.600
Did you mean--

01:11:19.280 --> 01:11:22.200
I could never marry a man
I do not love.

01:11:27.800 --> 01:11:29.879
Everybody out! Take the men.

01:11:29.960 --> 01:11:33.279
Head for the ships and set sail
at once for the cliff of Le Havre.

01:11:33.360 --> 01:11:34.647
What about you two?

01:11:35.400 --> 01:11:37.120
With God willing we will see you there.

01:11:42.501 --> 01:11:45.977
Let's go then. You heard the captain.
Let's move!

01:11:48.207 --> 01:11:49.927
We're going to need to cross the bridge.

01:11:51.520 --> 01:11:52.960
You'll ruin your dress.

01:11:56.760 --> 01:11:57.760
So I will.

01:12:00.120 --> 01:12:02.159
-You will follow the directions I gave--
-Doctor!

01:12:02.240 --> 01:12:03.240
Yes?

01:12:04.388 --> 01:12:06.428
It's the girl. She's escaped.

01:12:17.480 --> 01:12:19.959
Her only chance is to go
through the underground river.

01:12:20.040 --> 01:12:21.925
At least she is swimming to her freedom.

01:12:31.360 --> 01:12:34.055
The water level is too low for
her to jump the retaining wall.

01:12:35.414 --> 01:12:37.959
Can't you drain the water
from the chateau into the pool?

01:12:38.040 --> 01:12:41.039
If we drain the canal and the fountains
all at once, it might work but…

01:12:41.120 --> 01:12:44.133
-But what?
-The pipes might not hold.

01:12:46.040 --> 01:12:48.740
-What if they do?
-There is a tributary before Le Havre.

01:12:48.821 --> 01:12:50.399
which will give safe harbor to the sea.

01:12:50.480 --> 01:12:51.760
Can you communicate that to her?

01:12:53.440 --> 01:12:55.080
She understands everything.

01:13:15.217 --> 01:13:16.337
We should get moving.

01:13:24.840 --> 01:13:26.440
We need to reverse the water pressure.

01:13:58.520 --> 01:13:59.520
Stop them!

01:14:00.480 --> 01:14:01.799
The creature!

01:14:01.880 --> 01:14:03.215
It must not escape!

01:14:04.960 --> 01:14:05.959
No!

01:14:06.040 --> 01:14:07.600
We need it alive.

01:14:15.360 --> 01:14:16.360
Yves!

01:14:28.640 --> 01:14:29.920
You need to jump the wall!

01:14:38.937 --> 01:14:39.937
Labarthe!

01:14:54.080 --> 01:14:55.080
Yves!

01:14:56.640 --> 01:14:57.640
Yves!

01:15:11.120 --> 01:15:12.705
You've interfered enough!

01:15:19.680 --> 01:15:20.844
Take Yves and go!

01:15:23.120 --> 01:15:24.120
Now!

01:16:18.480 --> 01:16:21.000
See you there, God willing.

01:16:38.271 --> 01:16:40.439
The entire hydraulic
system have collapsed.

01:16:40.520 --> 01:16:41.759
And what of the girl?

01:16:41.840 --> 01:16:44.600
She was seen, riding off
the grounds, Your Majesty.

01:17:12.638 --> 01:17:13.559
This way to Le Havre.

01:17:13.640 --> 01:17:16.005
Order out the ships so there's no escape.

01:18:00.080 --> 01:18:02.160
Momma, a mermaid!

01:18:04.696 --> 01:18:08.456
Jean, you must have seen a fish.
Mermaids don't exist.

01:19:12.880 --> 01:19:13.880
Marie-Josephe!

01:19:15.156 --> 01:19:16.159
Stop.

01:19:16.240 --> 01:19:17.419
Stay.

01:19:18.120 --> 01:19:19.120
I will jump.

01:19:21.360 --> 01:19:22.360
You can't mean that.

01:19:23.480 --> 01:19:24.599
You are angry.

01:19:24.680 --> 01:19:26.880
-I understand, but life is so precious.
-No!

01:19:27.419 --> 01:19:28.939
You think you understand.

01:19:30.141 --> 01:19:31.141
You don't.

01:19:32.433 --> 01:19:33.433
Then tell me.

01:19:36.090 --> 01:19:39.090
The only opportunity I've ever wanted

01:19:40.349 --> 01:19:41.669
was to belong to someone.

01:19:44.120 --> 01:19:45.360
I came here,

01:19:46.973 --> 01:19:47.973
fell in love.

01:19:49.385 --> 01:19:53.745
I met a mermaid who has become
the greatest friend.

01:19:56.550 --> 01:19:57.910
And I found you…

01:19:59.296 --> 01:20:00.296
Father.

01:20:04.909 --> 01:20:07.959
-But you don't care about me.
-Don't say that.

01:20:08.040 --> 01:20:10.367
You don't care about anyone but yourself.

01:20:14.115 --> 01:20:16.035
Give me the chance to prove you wrong.

01:20:17.028 --> 01:20:18.468
How could that ever be?

01:20:39.400 --> 01:20:40.587
Musketeers,

01:20:41.760 --> 01:20:42.954
mark your target.

01:20:51.423 --> 01:20:52.258
It's simple.

01:20:53.076 --> 01:20:55.596
You take the mermaid, she gives you life.

01:20:57.080 --> 01:20:58.244
You let her live,

01:20:59.809 --> 01:21:01.289
she saves mine.

01:21:06.360 --> 01:21:07.520
What's your choice?

01:21:13.280 --> 01:21:14.280
Come get me.

01:21:15.880 --> 01:21:16.880
No!

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:47.680
I have a clean shot, Your Majesty.

01:21:50.080 --> 01:21:51.280
We're running out of time.

01:22:01.160 --> 01:22:02.240
Stand down.

01:22:48.477 --> 01:22:49.759
Are you all right?

01:22:49.840 --> 01:22:51.280
Yes, are you?

01:22:52.717 --> 01:22:53.717
She saved me.

01:22:54.560 --> 01:22:55.560
Us.

01:23:07.361 --> 01:23:09.121
You've always been a great king.

01:23:10.136 --> 01:23:12.696
But now you've become a great man.

01:23:14.600 --> 01:23:16.360
Signal the ships to retreat.

01:23:32.320 --> 01:23:33.320
You were right.

01:23:33.960 --> 01:23:35.480
It's something terrible.

01:23:37.920 --> 01:23:39.280
To care for someone.

01:23:45.960 --> 01:23:47.960
Bless me Father for I have sinned.

01:23:49.527 --> 01:23:54.004
In the name of the Father
and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.

01:23:56.680 --> 01:23:57.680
Amen.

01:24:10.160 --> 01:24:11.320
You are forgiven.

01:24:18.160 --> 01:24:21.080
Only love is immortal, Your Majesty.

01:24:23.160 --> 01:24:26.199
<i>So Captain Yves and Marie-Josephe</i>

01:24:26.280 --> 01:24:29.836
<i>started their life together
in search of Atlantis</i>

01:24:29.920 --> 01:24:33.560
<i>and their dear friend,
the magical mermaid.</i>

01:24:34.686 --> 01:24:37.046
We're close, I can feel it.
