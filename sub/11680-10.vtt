<i>I used to be a spy until...</i>

00:04.570 --> 00:07.071
We got a burn notice on you.
You're blacklisted.

00:07.139 --> 00:09.507
<i->When you're burned,
you've got nothing --

00:09.574 --> 00:12.196
<i>No cash, no credit,
no job history.</i>

00:12.264 --> 00:14.603
<i>You're stuck in whatever city
they decide to dump you in.</i>

00:14.671 --> 00:16.615
Where am I? Miami.

00:16.683 --> 00:19.832
<i>You do whatever work
comes your way.</i>

00:19.900 --> 00:22.502
<i>You rely on anyone who's still talking
to you.</i>

00:22.570 --> 00:24.147
<i>A trigger-happy ex-girlfriend...</i>

00:24.215 --> 00:25.785
Should we shoot them?

00:25.853 --> 00:28.363
<i>...An old friend who used to inform on
you to the fbi...</i>

00:28.431 --> 00:30.736
You know spies
a bunch of bitchy little girls.

00:30.803 --> 00:33.246
<i>...Family, too... Hey, is that your mom
again?</i>

00:33.313 --> 00:35.453
<i>...If you're desperate.
Someone needs your help, michael.</i>

00:35.521 --> 00:37.985
<i>Bottom line -- as long as you're
burned,</i>

00:38.052 --> 00:39.617
<i>You're not going anywhere.</i>

00:42.991 --> 00:44.792
<i>Previously on "burn notice"...</i>

00:44.859 --> 00:47.463
We had one fight, and you
decide to go back to ireland?

00:47.531 --> 00:48.898
This isn't about one fight, michael.

00:48.967 --> 00:50.267
It's bad news, mcbride.

00:50.335 --> 00:51.936
Someone's coming to kill my sister.

00:52.004 --> 00:54.608
Thomas o'neill. Bloodthirsty hooligan.

01:00.147 --> 01:02.916
You tell me where fiona is now!

01:02.985 --> 01:06.054
Why don't you do yourself a
favor and just forget the past?!

01:08.392 --> 01:09.960
Fiona is not my past.

01:16.970 --> 01:19.204
Aah!

01:19.272 --> 01:19.871
Fi!

01:19.939 --> 01:22.306
Fi! Fi!

01:22.374 --> 01:23.173
Aah!

01:25.411 --> 01:27.646
O'neill outed you as an american.

01:27.714 --> 01:29.448
You can never go back to ireland.

01:29.516 --> 01:30.950
Neither can she.

01:31.017 --> 01:32.618
What were you doing working
with tom strickler?

01:32.686 --> 01:34.620
You know the kind of
people he was in bed with?!

01:37.024 --> 01:39.926
Now someone's in town cleaning
up the mess he left behind.

01:39.994 --> 01:41.694
<i>Wait. Who's in town?
I don't know.</i>

01:41.762 --> 01:43.730
Someone's coming for me,
and they're coming for you, too.

Ow!

01:58.715 --> 02:00.416
Hold still. I'm almost done.

02:01.919 --> 02:03.419
<i>You're doing this on purpose.</i>

02:03.487 --> 02:05.288
I'm not the one who
tore your stitches out

02:05.355 --> 02:06.689
Second week in a row.

02:06.757 --> 02:10.393
Now stop moving, or you're
gonna do some serious damage.

02:10.460 --> 02:13.295
I will do some serious damage
to you when this is over.

02:13.363 --> 02:15.064
I promise you that, michael westen.

02:15.132 --> 02:17.333
You have the sewing
skills of an orangutan.

02:17.401 --> 02:19.502
There. Now you can
kill me if you want to.

02:19.570 --> 02:21.570
Oh, god, I want to.

02:21.638 --> 02:25.141
Okay, yes, you should rest.

02:25.208 --> 02:26.742
There you go.

02:28.578 --> 02:32.114
you're lucky that these
sedatives are kicking in

02:32.182 --> 02:33.716
<i>'cause I will kill you.</i>

02:33.783 --> 02:35.084
I'll be here.

02:36.786 --> 02:38.887
<i>Doing your own field medicine
has its advantages --</i>

02:38.955 --> 02:40.622
<i>No conversations with the police,</i>

02:40.690 --> 02:42.190
<i>The food's better,</i>

02:42.258 --> 02:44.125
<i>And the relationship between
patient and caregiver</i>

02:44.193 --> 02:45.393
<i>Is very close.</i>

02:45.461 --> 02:46.528
Ohh!

02:46.596 --> 02:48.630
Oh!

02:48.698 --> 02:51.666
<i>Of course, that last one can be
a disadvantage, as well.</i>

02:51.734 --> 02:52.667
Gotcha.

02:56.272 --> 02:58.239
So, is she finally out?

02:58.307 --> 03:00.508
I was afraid the paint was
gonna peel off the walls.

03:00.576 --> 03:02.510
<i>She'll be asleep for a while.
You know, it's funny.</i>

03:02.578 --> 03:04.779
When I thought she was leaving town,

03:04.846 --> 03:06.313
I actually felt a little bad.

03:06.381 --> 03:08.482
Hard to believe, I know.

03:08.550 --> 03:12.352
Well, it looks like she'll be
sticking around for a while.

03:12.420 --> 03:13.887
You find out anything?

03:13.955 --> 03:15.522
Yeah, I been calling around.

03:15.590 --> 03:18.091
The intelligence agencies are
checking in to diego's death.

03:18.159 --> 03:20.093
Apparently, enough people
saw you on the street

03:20.161 --> 03:21.461
That you're not a suspect.

03:21.529 --> 03:24.063
<i>For once, they're not blaming
me for something.</i>

03:24.131 --> 03:26.432
Well, it doesn't mean you're popular.

03:26.500 --> 03:29.401
Operation unburn michael
westen is officially off.

03:29.469 --> 03:30.369
I figured as much.

03:30.437 --> 03:31.837
Yeah, in the meantime,

03:31.905 --> 03:33.539
I'm checking out the phone that
you lifted off of strickler.

03:33.606 --> 03:34.873
I've been trying to figure out

03:34.941 --> 03:36.908
Who threw diego off that hotel balcony.

03:36.976 --> 03:38.076
Any luck?

03:38.144 --> 03:40.045
Well, it's slow going.

03:40.112 --> 03:41.780
I mean, the guy called for
takeout food, escort agencies,

03:41.847 --> 03:44.115
And, of course, he was
calling all around the world

03:44.183 --> 03:45.717
About your little burn notice.

03:45.784 --> 03:48.553
<i>But best lead is this hotel
on south beach.</i>

03:48.621 --> 03:51.455
<i>If we're looking for someone in miami,
that's my bet.</i>

03:51.523 --> 03:52.690
Thanks, sam.

03:52.758 --> 03:53.858
Want me to go down there with you?

03:53.925 --> 03:55.059
I mean, everything you say,

03:55.126 --> 03:56.694
This guy sounds like a
grade "a" psychopath.

03:56.761 --> 03:58.362
I'll be careful.

03:58.429 --> 03:59.930
Take care of fi?

03:59.997 --> 04:00.864
Of course.

04:09.607 --> 04:11.574
<i>Getting information out of hotels</i>

04:11.642 --> 04:14.109
<i>Requires a delicate touch.</i>

04:14.177 --> 04:17.045
<i>One whiff that you're snooping and
you'll just hear a lot of,</i>

04:17.112 --> 04:18.980
<i>"we can't give out that
information."</i>

04:19.047 --> 04:20.615
<i>You need to get them
on your side,</i>

04:20.682 --> 04:22.048
<i>Convince them that you're someone</i>

04:22.117 --> 04:23.316
<i>That needs customer service.</i>

04:23.384 --> 04:25.785
Excuse me. Wondering
if you could help me.

04:25.853 --> 04:27.953
A friend of mine was
staying here at the hotel,

04:28.020 --> 04:30.321
And, uh, well,
we were supposed to hook up.

04:30.389 --> 04:32.656
Mr. Westen? We've been expecting you.

04:32.724 --> 04:36.325
<i>Of course, when the hotel clerk turns
out to be expecting you,</i>

04:36.393 --> 04:37.994
<i>That makes things a
little easier.</i>

04:38.062 --> 04:40.196
Left it...For me? You sure?

04:40.264 --> 04:41.731
Yes, he had the bellman drop it off.

04:41.799 --> 04:43.699
He said you'd be 6'1",

04:43.767 --> 04:46.234
Exquisitely dressed,
with impeccable posture.

04:54.108 --> 04:56.409
<i>In the world of espionage,</i>

04:56.476 --> 04:58.611
<i>There are a lot of ways to
introduce yourself.</i>

04:58.679 --> 05:01.513
<i>You can use official channels.
You can use a cover I.D.</i>

05:01.581 --> 05:03.849
<i>You can use encrypted
communication.</i>

05:03.916 --> 05:05.783
<i>Whatever the method,</i>

05:05.851 --> 05:08.519
<i>That first contact tells you a
lot about a person...</i>

05:12.389 --> 05:15.591
<i>...Especially when someone
introduces himself</i>

05:15.659 --> 05:17.693
<i>By firebombing a hotel room.</i>

05:24.950 --> 05:26.985
Did you see anything? Michael:
Not really.

05:27.252 --> 05:28.319
I don't know what he looks like.

05:28.787 --> 05:30.954
They never saw his
face at the front desk.

05:31.922 --> 05:34.456
The room is registered to dr.
Randolph quilling.

05:34.524 --> 05:36.958
Quilling? Mike, you serious?

05:37.026 --> 05:39.994
He was a british nuclear scientist,
killed in '99.

05:40.062 --> 05:42.597
Burned to death in his hotel room.

05:42.664 --> 05:44.432
I think mike's new friend is telling us

05:44.499 --> 05:45.733
That he was involved.

05:45.800 --> 05:47.100
It's a hell of a thing,

05:47.168 --> 05:49.369
Torching a hotel room
as your business card.

05:49.436 --> 05:51.904
Well, as long as we're
waiting for our mystery man

05:51.972 --> 05:53.505
To say hello again,

05:53.573 --> 05:55.841
I need you to take a meeting for me.

05:55.908 --> 05:58.376
It's an insurance-scam thing.

05:58.444 --> 05:59.944
I would do it -- ohh! -- Myself,

06:00.012 --> 06:01.679
But in my current state...

06:01.747 --> 06:03.614
You were going to leave the country.

06:03.682 --> 06:05.682
You were still taking jobs?

06:05.750 --> 06:07.183
Well, I had already committed to this --

06:07.251 --> 06:08.985
One last thing before
going back to ireland,

06:09.053 --> 06:11.420
<i>But someone got outed as
an american spy,</i>

06:11.488 --> 06:12.655
And now I can't go home.

06:12.723 --> 06:14.089
We saved your life, remember?

06:14.157 --> 06:15.757
Saved? Please.

06:17.026 --> 06:20.061
It's out at the hallandale impound lot.

06:27.869 --> 06:29.436
Thank you for meeting me.

06:29.504 --> 06:31.338
A friend of mine referred me to fiona.

06:31.406 --> 06:33.740
Said she could take care of anything.

06:33.808 --> 06:35.408
Yeah, fiona's good at what she does.

06:35.476 --> 06:37.477
That's my husband's car.

06:37.545 --> 06:40.913
He was killed last month
in a five-car pileup.

06:40.981 --> 06:43.916
I thought it was an accident,
but...I found this.

06:45.418 --> 06:48.053
They're insurance forms,
already filled out.

06:48.121 --> 06:51.789
Some scam was gonna pay him
to say that he hurt his neck.

06:51.857 --> 06:53.858
We had money problems, and...

06:53.926 --> 06:55.860
He was just trying to save us.

06:55.927 --> 06:57.361
Instead, he got killed?

06:57.429 --> 07:00.263
Some guy came to my house
last week in a corvette.

07:00.331 --> 07:02.264
He said that since my husband died,

07:02.332 --> 07:04.366
I have to sue the city
for wrongful death

07:04.434 --> 07:05.667
And give them the money.

07:05.735 --> 07:07.335
He threatened my family.

07:07.403 --> 07:09.370
Do you think that there's
any way that fiona can help?

07:09.437 --> 07:10.971
I'll see what she can do.

07:14.808 --> 07:16.442
She'll be in touch when we know more.

07:16.510 --> 07:17.977
Thank you.

07:21.081 --> 07:22.148
Sam.

07:22.215 --> 07:23.615
Hey, mikey.

07:23.683 --> 07:25.983
I need you to go over to
the county records office.

07:26.050 --> 07:28.718
See if you can get them to slip
you some insurance records.

07:28.786 --> 07:30.453
Mike, you can't just ask for that stuff.

07:30.521 --> 07:32.221
Use your sam magic.

07:32.289 --> 07:34.990
<i>oh. Why didn't I think of that?</i>

07:38.628 --> 07:41.695
<i>The day that the cellphone call log was
invented</i>

07:41.763 --> 07:45.164
<i>Should be celebrated as a
national holiday for spies.</i>

07:45.232 --> 07:48.634
<i>Even a cautious cellphone user who uses
dial-back systems</i>

07:48.702 --> 07:50.402
<i>Or switches phones often</i>

07:50.470 --> 07:53.438
<i>Leaves behind a lot of information you
can use.</i>

07:53.506 --> 07:54.972
You still going through that thing?

07:55.040 --> 07:56.407
Strickler used this phone.

07:56.474 --> 07:58.041
Chances are he talked to whoever it is

07:58.109 --> 08:01.077
That's torching hotel
rooms to say hello to me.

08:01.144 --> 08:04.012
Have you considered turning
this over to homeland security?

08:04.080 --> 08:06.448
They get paid for this
sort of thing, you know.

08:06.516 --> 08:09.451
<i>For all I know, he could be working for
homeland security.</i>

08:09.519 --> 08:11.486
I'll call someone when I need someone.

08:13.955 --> 08:15.555
How'd it go at the county
records office, sam?

08:15.623 --> 08:16.556
Not good, mike.

08:16.624 --> 08:18.891
I tried to get something,

08:18.959 --> 08:21.760
Anything, out of that lady down
there about the insurance scam.

08:21.827 --> 08:23.594
She's 65, a widow,

08:23.662 --> 08:25.998
And completely immune
to my charming ways.

08:26.065 --> 08:28.434
Seriously? You couldn't
get the medical records

08:28.502 --> 08:30.402
Out of a 65-year-old woman, sam?

08:30.470 --> 08:32.070
She's my kryptonite, okay?

08:32.136 --> 08:33.537
I'm telling you, mike,

08:33.605 --> 08:35.304
You want to get the
files out of that broad,

08:35.373 --> 08:36.807
It's gonna take some extreme measures.

08:36.874 --> 08:39.107
I got an idea how to do it,

08:39.176 --> 08:40.710
But you're not gonna like it.

08:40.777 --> 08:44.145
You want me to lie to some woman
in the county records office?

08:44.212 --> 08:45.547
What did she do?

08:45.614 --> 08:46.714
Well, no, she didn't do anything.

08:46.782 --> 08:48.448
She's the only one that has access

08:48.516 --> 08:49.949
To the information we need.

08:50.017 --> 08:51.417
<i>Why me?</i>

08:51.485 --> 08:53.586
Because she's your age,
smokes your brand, and...

08:53.654 --> 08:55.054
Shops at the same stores you...Do.

08:55.121 --> 08:57.189
Sam did some scouting.

08:57.257 --> 08:59.924
We just thought that you would
be someone she would trust.

08:59.991 --> 09:02.259
<i>So that I can lie to her.</i>

09:02.326 --> 09:03.593
It's for a good cause, mom.

09:03.661 --> 09:05.195
The people we're trying to find

09:05.262 --> 09:06.562
Got some guys killed already.

09:13.934 --> 09:16.135
<i>Human intelligence can
often be collected</i>

09:16.203 --> 09:17.604
<i>With a cover identity.</i>

09:17.671 --> 09:19.172
<i>There are times, though,</i>

09:19.240 --> 09:21.941
<i>When a cover I.D. Has more
to do with who you are</i>

09:22.009 --> 09:24.511
<i>Than how you act.</i>

09:24.578 --> 09:27.612
Yes, I've been through our
records dozens of times.

09:27.680 --> 09:31.048
We lost a lot of that stuff in
a hurricane a few years ago,

09:31.116 --> 09:32.883
And I've got files

09:32.950 --> 09:35.085
That, um, are nothing but mildew.

09:35.152 --> 09:38.421
Isn't that the worst?
I lost a couch that way.

09:38.489 --> 09:41.056
I swear, sometimes I think we
should all move to phoenix.

09:45.094 --> 09:46.494
Hmm?

09:46.562 --> 09:48.829
If you could just give me
all the names of the doctors

09:48.897 --> 09:50.063
Who treated my husband...

09:50.131 --> 09:52.632
Ooh. I wish I could.

09:52.700 --> 09:55.501
Those files are all sealed, though.

09:55.569 --> 09:57.970
Doctor/patient confidentiality.

09:58.038 --> 09:59.805
Oh.

09:59.873 --> 10:02.274
I just thought maybe...

10:02.341 --> 10:03.808
Not even a quick glance?

10:03.876 --> 10:05.476
Not even a peek.

10:14.751 --> 10:19.020
<i>Working an intelligence asset is
part acting, part strategy.</i>

10:19.088 --> 10:21.189
<i>Some people don't have
the talent...</i>

10:22.391 --> 10:23.891
<i>...And some people do.</i>

10:23.958 --> 10:26.292
thank you for your time.

10:26.360 --> 10:27.993
Are you all right? Yeah.

10:28.061 --> 10:30.496
Sorry.

10:30.563 --> 10:32.130
It was --

10:32.198 --> 10:34.365
It was so much easier
when my husband was alive.

10:35.534 --> 10:37.067
Thank you.

10:37.135 --> 10:39.302
And he used to do all
of this stuff for me.

10:42.473 --> 10:44.173
I'm sorry to have bothered you.

10:45.808 --> 10:46.941
Uh...

10:47.009 --> 10:48.009
Wait.

10:49.345 --> 10:51.145
Let me see what I can dig up.

10:52.781 --> 10:54.482
This will be our secret, though.

10:54.550 --> 10:55.850
Of course.

10:55.918 --> 10:57.318
Don't get me fired.

10:57.386 --> 10:58.486
Oh, no.

10:58.553 --> 11:01.254
No. Oh, my goodness. Thank you so much.

11:06.427 --> 11:07.627
There he is.

11:07.695 --> 11:10.129
Your mom's got a gift
for working assets.

11:10.196 --> 11:13.131
She brought back every
document I asked for.

11:13.198 --> 11:14.998
Well, she's done her fair
share of manipulating people

11:15.066 --> 11:16.299
Over the years.

11:16.367 --> 11:18.934
Well, she wasn't very
happy about doing this.

11:19.002 --> 11:21.503
So, our local county
clinic is looking good.

11:21.570 --> 11:22.804
It's got your normal folks,

11:22.872 --> 11:24.273
But there's a few too
many shady characters

11:24.341 --> 11:26.708
Walking out of there with
neck braces, you know?

11:26.776 --> 11:28.009
Oh, check out the wheels.

11:28.077 --> 11:30.077
Remembered you said that
our bad guy drove a vette?

11:30.145 --> 11:32.079
So I called my buddy to run the plates.

11:32.147 --> 11:34.315
The guy's name is ryan johnson.

11:34.383 --> 11:36.384
He's on parole for fraud and assault,

11:36.452 --> 11:39.187
So I'm guessing he didn't get
that corvette and the iwc watch

11:39.255 --> 11:40.589
From his work-release job.

11:40.657 --> 11:43.025
Looks like the guy calia
said smacked her around.

11:43.092 --> 11:45.027
Yeah. Oh, got a cover I.D. For you.

11:45.095 --> 11:48.062
You're from north carolina.
You're a friend of erik lee's.

11:48.130 --> 11:49.129
Who's erik lee?

11:49.197 --> 11:50.730
Well, he's one of ryan's buddies

11:50.798 --> 11:53.698
Who was killed in the same
crash as calia's husband.

11:53.766 --> 11:55.932
Stuff should check out if
they don't check too deep.

11:56.000 --> 11:58.101
well, looks like I'm going for a drive.

11:58.168 --> 11:59.935
Have fun, mikey.

12:02.272 --> 12:04.740
<i>Precision driving is part of
the standard training</i>

12:04.808 --> 12:06.508
<i>For an operative.</i>

12:06.576 --> 12:09.044
<i>It's mainly used when pursuing or being
pursued.</i>

12:09.112 --> 12:13.282
<i>But on occasion, it's a great way
to make an impression.</i>

12:16.252 --> 12:17.986
Whoo! Hey, boy!

12:18.054 --> 12:19.554
Yeah, you and me
you and me need to talk!

12:55.986 --> 12:58.320
Jesus! Are you crazy?!

12:58.388 --> 13:00.689
Hey, I'm alex. You must
be ryan johnson, right?

13:00.757 --> 13:02.657
What the hell is this?

13:02.725 --> 13:05.359
Hell, what's it look like,
boy? It's a job application.

13:13.652 --> 13:15.085
<i>Just like all businesses do.</i>

13:15.153 --> 13:16.922
<i>They can't give too
much information</i>

13:16.989 --> 13:18.958
<i>To new hires, of course,</i>

13:19.026 --> 13:21.027
<i>But they also can't pass up real
talent.</i>

13:21.094 --> 13:24.763
I was driving for an insurance
crew up in north carolina.

13:24.831 --> 13:27.766
I was working with your
boy erik lee up there.

13:27.833 --> 13:29.667
Erik's not with us anymore.

13:29.735 --> 13:31.769
Yeah, I know. Got himself killed.

13:31.837 --> 13:33.904
Squashed by a truck a few weeks back.

13:33.972 --> 13:36.273
Yeah, something like that.

13:36.340 --> 13:39.709
Word on the street is you're the numbe
r-one crew around town.

13:39.777 --> 13:41.811
And sounds like you got a job openin'.

13:46.882 --> 13:49.283
Well, you can drive.
I'll give you that. You give me that?

13:49.351 --> 13:51.652
Hell, I'll take it.
I'm the best wheelman around.

13:51.720 --> 13:53.520
You got someone working for
you you think is better,

13:53.588 --> 13:54.921
You point him out,
and I'll prove you wrong.

13:56.791 --> 13:59.826
There's a bar down at the
river on fifth street.

13:59.894 --> 14:01.828
Meet me there tomorrow at noon.

14:11.304 --> 14:13.305
They sent some more guys by the house.

14:13.372 --> 14:16.140
Sat there glaring at me while
I filled out some paperwork.

14:16.208 --> 14:18.041
You're doing the right thing.

14:18.109 --> 14:20.442
Just stay cool, do as they ask,
and we'll take care of it.

14:20.510 --> 14:22.511
But can't you just talk to them or --

14:22.578 --> 14:23.912
It's not gonna do much
good at this point.

14:23.979 --> 14:25.113
they may back off for a while,

14:25.180 --> 14:26.247
But they'll come right back

14:26.314 --> 14:27.414
And do it again to someone else.

14:27.482 --> 14:29.415
An insurance scam is like a network --

14:29.483 --> 14:32.917
Doctors, lawyers,
auto-repair places, enforcers.

14:32.985 --> 14:34.252
If you don't want
people coming after you,

14:34.320 --> 14:35.320
You have to take down the whole thing --

14:35.388 --> 14:36.655
Pull the weed out by the roots.

14:36.722 --> 14:39.526
We'll get these guys going
on a scam, call the cops,

14:39.594 --> 14:41.060
And get them caught in the act.

14:41.128 --> 14:41.994
I'll keep you and your boys safe.

14:42.062 --> 14:42.995
Thank you.

14:43.063 --> 14:44.330
You've been so amazing.

14:44.397 --> 14:46.465
And the people that you
have working for you,

14:46.532 --> 14:47.299
They're just great!

14:49.501 --> 14:51.535
It's so important to find good help.

14:54.572 --> 14:56.740
Mike, I've been working
on our little manhunt.

14:56.807 --> 14:58.141
I wish I had more to go on

14:58.208 --> 14:59.876
Than a nameless, faceless murderer

14:59.943 --> 15:01.844
With a taste for arson, but anyway...

15:01.912 --> 15:04.079
Feds got nothing.
They ruled diego a suicide.

15:04.147 --> 15:05.414
And you? You done any better?

15:05.481 --> 15:06.648
Well, a little.

15:06.716 --> 15:08.083
I've been triangulating
one of the phones

15:08.151 --> 15:10.418
That strickler was calling,
trying to get a location.

15:10.486 --> 15:12.020
How long before we got something?

15:12.088 --> 15:13.421
Couple of days, but, you know,

15:13.488 --> 15:15.423
No matter who this guy is,
mike, we know two things --

15:15.490 --> 15:17.758
He's a killer, and he saw
you coming before, so I --

15:17.826 --> 15:19.493
I don't have a lot of options here.

15:19.561 --> 15:22.062
<i>Someone killed my cia contact.
Now, that is on my head.</i>

15:22.129 --> 15:24.830
I don't get to walk away or
pretend it didn't happen,

15:24.898 --> 15:27.432
No matter how dangerous
this game he's playing is.

15:27.500 --> 15:29.768
You know that,
and you'd do the same thing.

15:29.835 --> 15:31.936
I get it. I don't like it, but I get it.

15:32.003 --> 15:33.437
Let me know when you
got something solid.

15:33.504 --> 15:34.638
You got it.

15:34.705 --> 15:36.773
Oh, mike, uh, one more thing.

15:36.841 --> 15:38.908
I think your mom is a little unclear

15:38.976 --> 15:41.677
About the proper handling
of intelligence assets.

15:41.745 --> 15:43.312
You might want to talk to her.

15:50.952 --> 15:53.019
You want another gin and tonic, tina?

15:53.087 --> 15:55.888
Oh, no, no, thanks! I'm fine.

15:58.425 --> 16:00.125
Hi, honey.

16:00.193 --> 16:02.160
Tina, this is my son michael.

16:02.228 --> 16:03.929
Y-your handsome son!

16:03.997 --> 16:06.598
<i>it's very nice to meet you.</i>

16:06.666 --> 16:09.967
mom, could I talk with you for a second?

16:10.035 --> 16:12.403
Sure. Would you excuse me, tina?

16:12.471 --> 16:14.072
Sure you don't want another?

16:21.446 --> 16:24.147
Mom, what are you doing?

16:24.215 --> 16:25.648
What does it look like I'm doing?

16:25.716 --> 16:27.150
I'm playing canasta with a friend.

16:27.217 --> 16:28.851
A friend? No, she's a --

16:28.918 --> 16:30.152
She did me a favor!

16:30.219 --> 16:31.486
Why can't we be friends?

16:31.553 --> 16:33.354
That's not how it works.

16:33.422 --> 16:35.823
You told her your name, my name.

16:35.891 --> 16:38.258
You don't socialize with an asset!

16:38.326 --> 16:39.526
She's not an "asset."

16:39.594 --> 16:41.594
She's a person, sitting
at my dining-room table.

16:41.662 --> 16:43.062
I know that!

16:43.130 --> 16:46.598
Mom...It's dangerous. She broke the law.

16:46.666 --> 16:48.266
You said... That that job was over.

16:50.802 --> 16:52.803
Just don't get too close.

17:03.479 --> 17:05.179
What are you worried about?

17:05.247 --> 17:07.748
So your mom becomes friends
with the county records lady.

17:07.816 --> 17:09.016
So what?

17:09.084 --> 17:10.651
You just never know how
things are gonna go.

17:10.718 --> 17:13.119
She's an asset. Things
could get very complicated.

17:13.186 --> 17:15.588
<i>I was an asset of yours once.</i>

17:15.656 --> 17:17.290
And things got complicated...

17:17.358 --> 17:18.723
...And people got hurt.

17:18.791 --> 17:20.358
True.

17:20.425 --> 17:23.361
But in my experience...

17:23.428 --> 17:25.863
People get hurt and
things get complicated

17:25.930 --> 17:27.164
No matter what you do.

17:47.715 --> 17:49.949
Dad, this is the guy I
was telling you about.

17:50.017 --> 17:51.250
You said you wanted drivers?

17:51.318 --> 17:52.818
Well, this guy can drive.

17:52.886 --> 17:54.419
He drove with erik lee
up in north carolina.

17:54.487 --> 17:56.288
I checked him out,
and he's the real deal.

17:56.356 --> 17:57.889
so you're the big, bad boss.

17:57.957 --> 18:01.559
Boss? No. Just a businessman.

18:04.162 --> 18:05.829
Sounds good. 'cause I'm
looking to do some business.

18:05.897 --> 18:07.564
I'm looking for a crew.
You know what I'm saying?

18:07.631 --> 18:09.499
I did some driving up north -- amateurs.

18:09.566 --> 18:10.933
They didn't know real talent.

18:11.001 --> 18:13.135
Talent, huh?

18:13.202 --> 18:15.536
What ryan said, it sounded
more like recklessness.

18:15.604 --> 18:17.572
Well, talent, recklessness
it's a fine line, ain't it?

18:17.639 --> 18:20.040
You got any warrants? You do,
you don't drive.

18:20.108 --> 18:22.209
I'm clean. Accidents?
How's your driving record?

18:22.277 --> 18:24.410
I got plenty of accidents,
but none on my record.

18:24.478 --> 18:25.912
All right, here's the deal.

18:25.979 --> 18:28.013
We use a couple dozen drivers a year,

18:28.081 --> 18:29.415
Rotate them in and out,

18:29.482 --> 18:31.717
Make sure nobody shows up
in the system too much.

18:31.784 --> 18:33.885
You make sure ryan has your information,

18:33.953 --> 18:35.720
<i>And we'll call you.</i>

18:35.788 --> 18:37.922
So, next time, I'll need you to
bring me your driver's license.

18:37.990 --> 18:39.690
I'll need local and out of state.

18:39.758 --> 18:40.858
Whoa, there, my friend.

18:40.925 --> 18:43.260
Maybe I wasn't making myself clear.

18:43.328 --> 18:45.262
I'm not looking to make
a few hundred bucks

18:45.329 --> 18:47.063
Driving third wheel in a bump-and-run.

18:47.131 --> 18:48.865
I'm here looking for some business,

18:48.932 --> 18:50.800
With a team, management.

18:50.867 --> 18:52.734
Get your hand off me.

18:55.871 --> 18:57.905
I'm just hoping you're not
wasting my time, is all.

19:00.008 --> 19:01.408
Management, huh?

19:01.476 --> 19:02.843
I'll tell you what.

19:02.910 --> 19:05.945
There's an auto-body shop
in boca owes us 10 grand,

19:06.012 --> 19:08.480
And my boy here hasn't
been able to collect.

19:08.548 --> 19:10.148
Dad, I told you that I can handle that.

19:10.216 --> 19:12.416
Shut up. You're the one that
brought this guy in here.

19:12.484 --> 19:14.584
You two go up there together.

19:14.652 --> 19:16.886
You get our money back, you got a job.

19:18.622 --> 19:20.222
<i>Now, that sounds like a deal.</i>

19:21.958 --> 19:24.926
<i>Family businesses are tough,</i>

19:24.994 --> 19:27.061
<i>And they're even tougher for criminals.</i>

19:27.129 --> 19:29.830
<i>Mix normal family
issues with cash,</i>

19:29.898 --> 19:32.466
<i>Violence, and the danger
of getting arrested,</i>

19:32.534 --> 19:34.467
<i>And things get tense.</i>

19:34.535 --> 19:36.169
Oh, come on, kid, don't be like that.

19:36.236 --> 19:37.670
This'll work out good. You'll see.

19:37.737 --> 19:38.837
Whatever.

19:38.905 --> 19:40.439
It's not like you can't use the help.

19:40.506 --> 19:42.174
From what I saw in the papers,

19:42.241 --> 19:43.842
<i>You could use someone like me.</i>

19:43.909 --> 19:45.509
I mean, a crash like that --

19:45.577 --> 19:47.144
You know what? We do just fine.

19:47.212 --> 19:48.479
All right? We do more than fine.

19:48.547 --> 19:50.248
The wife of one of the
dead guys -- she's suing.

19:50.316 --> 19:52.683
We're looking to get a million
out of the city, maybe more.

19:52.751 --> 19:55.019
She's willing to go to
court for you? She will.

19:55.086 --> 19:56.787
Or...

19:56.855 --> 19:58.522
Her little kid will fall
down the stairs at school.

19:58.590 --> 19:59.890
Whoo-hoo!

19:59.957 --> 20:01.891
You boys know how to
kick some ass, don't you?

20:01.959 --> 20:03.826
Tell me more about
this little collection.

20:03.894 --> 20:05.694
It's a bunch of bikers.
All right, this is stupid.

20:05.762 --> 20:07.996
I've already -- I've already
talked to these guys twice already.

20:08.064 --> 20:10.298
Well, third time's a charm.

20:21.441 --> 20:24.743
I told you, we're not
kicking back 10 grand.

20:24.811 --> 20:25.878
Tony, you wouldn't have made any of that

20:25.946 --> 20:27.179
If we hadn't rigged the bids!

20:27.247 --> 20:29.415
We already did the work!
That's the way it's --

20:29.483 --> 20:31.383
<i>Girls, girls, girls, don't fight.
You're both pretty.</i>

20:31.451 --> 20:32.417
Tell you what.

20:33.819 --> 20:35.987
<i>You won't give him the money,
you can give me the money.</i>

20:36.055 --> 20:37.822
You're not getting that money.

20:37.890 --> 20:40.124
Oh, y'all are gonna give
me the money right now.

20:49.000 --> 20:51.033
Alex, what are you doing? What the
hell's it look like I'm doing?!

20:51.101 --> 20:52.934
I'm getting you your 10 grand!

20:53.002 --> 20:54.467
<i>Anybody who works
around acetylene</i>

20:54.535 --> 20:56.768
<i>Knows to be extra careful.</i>

20:56.835 --> 20:58.803
<i>It's one of the hottest-burning,</i>

20:58.871 --> 21:00.037
<i>Most explosive gases
in existence.</i>

21:00.105 --> 21:01.705
They ain't gonna shoot,

21:01.773 --> 21:03.073
Not while we're near these tanks.

21:03.141 --> 21:04.508
Because if they do,

21:04.575 --> 21:06.943
There'll be little pieces of
biker raining all around here!

21:07.011 --> 21:07.777
10 grand now!

21:09.646 --> 21:11.847
Hey, stop!

21:11.915 --> 21:13.915
You can make this stop anytime...

21:13.983 --> 21:15.616
If you put 10 grand into a bag,

21:15.684 --> 21:17.719
Throw your guns in it
while you're at it!

21:17.786 --> 21:20.154
Anytime now!

21:20.222 --> 21:22.023
Do what he says! Get the money!

21:23.425 --> 21:25.793
Dad, we got it!

21:25.860 --> 21:26.960
Yeah, all 10 grand!

21:27.028 --> 21:28.195
Look, you got a job!

21:28.263 --> 21:30.397
Well, that's good news.
You're making my day.

21:30.465 --> 21:33.166
Oh, we should celebrate somewhere else!

21:38.171 --> 21:39.571
Damn!

21:43.554 --> 21:44.554
I'm gonna bring him some ideas.

21:44.772 --> 21:46.439
Calia and son are at my place.

21:46.506 --> 21:47.840
I'll go give them the good news.

21:49.841 --> 21:52.475
You are doing so well on this job.

21:52.543 --> 21:55.211
I think we're almost even.

21:55.279 --> 21:56.212
Almost.

22:01.650 --> 22:02.784
What's wrong, sam?

22:02.852 --> 22:05.586
I've never seen you drink
a beer that slowly.

22:05.654 --> 22:07.020
I just think we'd be better off

22:07.088 --> 22:08.989
If we focused on this
insuranc e-scammer thing

22:09.056 --> 22:11.424
And forgot the whole "diego
getting murdered" business,

22:11.492 --> 22:12.792
'cause it's not looking pretty.

22:12.860 --> 22:14.226
Well, what is it?

22:14.294 --> 22:16.395
Well, I did the triangulation
on that phone --

22:16.462 --> 22:18.797
You know, the one that our hote
l-room-torching mystery man

22:18.865 --> 22:20.565
Was using? -- And I found it.

22:20.633 --> 22:21.499
Well?

22:21.567 --> 22:22.767
The thing is,

22:22.835 --> 22:24.635
The phone is down at
the old marine stadium.

22:24.703 --> 22:26.303
Marine stadium? Isn't it closed?

22:26.371 --> 22:28.939
Yeah, for like 20 years.
It's just a graffiti magnet.

22:29.006 --> 22:30.840
And the phone is just sitting there?

22:30.908 --> 22:33.442
It's such a setup, mike,
it's not even a setup, you know?

22:34.877 --> 22:36.545
So, what are you gonna do?

22:36.612 --> 22:39.180
I'm gonna go down there.
I'm gonna check it out.

22:39.248 --> 22:40.582
Of course you are.

22:44.286 --> 22:46.553
<i>For a covert operative,</i>

22:46.620 --> 22:49.155
<i>There's often a fine line between
hunter and hunted.</i>

22:49.222 --> 22:51.623
<i>Letting someone hunt you
is just another way</i>

22:51.691 --> 22:53.558
<i>Of finding out more about them.</i>

22:53.625 --> 22:55.693
Cellphone signal's coming from out here.

22:55.761 --> 22:57.661
<i>Of course, there's
also a fine line</i>

22:57.729 --> 22:59.329
<i>Between following up intelligence</i>

22:59.397 --> 23:00.663
<i>And walking into a trap.</i>

23:00.731 --> 23:02.665
Doesn't get more exposed
than this, does it?

23:02.733 --> 23:04.101
You sure you want to do this?

23:04.169 --> 23:07.804
Yeah, I'm sure. Stay here.
Cover me as best as you can.

23:32.794 --> 23:34.528
Hello?

23:34.595 --> 23:36.496
Sorry we missed each other at the hotel.

23:36.564 --> 23:37.797
Me too.

23:37.865 --> 23:39.032
I've heard so much about you.

23:39.099 --> 23:40.499
It's an honor to see you in the flesh.

23:40.567 --> 23:41.967
You're quite a puzzle, mr. Westen.

23:42.034 --> 23:43.334
Fascinating.

23:43.402 --> 23:44.535
I'm far more interesting in person.

23:44.603 --> 23:45.769
Who are you?

23:45.837 --> 23:47.337
Oh, I can't just tell you, now, can I?

23:47.405 --> 23:48.872
Where's the fun in that?

23:48.940 --> 23:52.275
I'm trying to figure out
what kind of man you are.

23:52.343 --> 23:54.077
I need to decide if you're someone

23:54.145 --> 23:55.278
I should get to know better...

23:57.281 --> 23:59.082
...Or someone I should kill.

24:01.451 --> 24:03.085
Well, let me know when
you make up your mind.

24:03.153 --> 24:04.285
Oh, you'll know.

24:05.987 --> 24:08.187
Mike, get out of there!

24:18.163 --> 24:19.597
You okay, brother?

24:19.665 --> 24:20.732
I'm fine, sam.

24:26.002 --> 24:28.169
So, how did the big meeting go?

24:28.237 --> 24:31.439
We had a brief and
unsatisfying chat on the phone.

24:31.506 --> 24:33.306
So, who is he?

24:33.374 --> 24:36.009
I don't know, but he shot
up the marine stadium.

24:36.077 --> 24:38.111
Reminded me of a stadium shooting

24:38.179 --> 24:39.913
Back in '98 in south america.

24:39.980 --> 24:43.082
Sam's looking into it,
seeing if there's a connection.

24:43.150 --> 24:44.617
I started on a listening device

24:44.684 --> 24:46.819
For your meeting with ryan later.

24:46.886 --> 24:48.286
Would you care to join me?

24:48.354 --> 24:49.954
I would love to.

24:54.792 --> 24:56.492
You know...

24:56.560 --> 24:57.960
After the other day,

24:58.028 --> 25:00.662
I-I never really did get a
a chance to actually say...

25:00.730 --> 25:03.431
Well, not that I have
any doubt in my mind

25:03.499 --> 25:06.200
That I would have saved
myself eventually...

25:06.267 --> 25:08.168
And I still think that
your tactical approach

25:08.236 --> 25:09.569
Was a little iffy.

25:09.637 --> 25:11.370
But you and sam...

25:11.438 --> 25:13.472
You did come back for me.

25:13.539 --> 25:15.841
You gave up a lot to come back for me...

25:15.908 --> 25:17.475
Whether I needed it or not.

25:17.543 --> 25:18.543
You're welcome, fi.

25:22.247 --> 25:23.781
Watch it.

25:23.848 --> 25:26.517
You're getting solder on my transmitter.

25:35.532 --> 25:38.134
So, 10 grand.

25:38.201 --> 25:40.269
Ryan here is still a
little fuzzy on the details

25:40.337 --> 25:41.771
Of how you two got it.

25:41.838 --> 25:43.405
But...

25:43.473 --> 25:44.540
me and ryan here are
like bonnie and clyde.

25:44.607 --> 25:45.574
You'd have been proud.

25:45.641 --> 25:46.908
I'm sure I would have.

25:46.976 --> 25:48.776
We got the money, all right?

25:48.844 --> 25:52.546
You want to talk about
management opportunities?

25:52.614 --> 25:53.647
Talk.

25:53.715 --> 25:55.482
Scam's called "deathwish."

25:55.549 --> 25:57.483
I ran it a couple times back
when I was just starting out.

25:57.551 --> 25:59.385
I'm gonna need a stooge,

25:59.452 --> 26:01.553
Someone who can take some
damage but for a serious payday.

26:01.621 --> 26:02.721
Yeah, I know a few people.

26:04.323 --> 26:07.024
The stooge sets up at
a railroad crossing,

26:07.092 --> 26:08.859
Gets a city vehicle behind them.

26:08.927 --> 26:11.461
We come in as a three-man team.

26:11.529 --> 26:14.831
Two drivers box the city vehicle in.

26:14.898 --> 26:17.233
Third driver, he knocks the city vehicle

26:17.300 --> 26:20.369
Into the stooge's car,
stooge goes into the railroad...

26:20.436 --> 26:21.336
Train hits the car, right?

26:21.404 --> 26:22.737
That's right.

26:22.805 --> 26:24.639
One of those big engines clips it,

26:24.707 --> 26:26.774
Bashes it up real good, spins it around,

26:26.842 --> 26:28.475
Newspapers take photos,

26:28.543 --> 26:29.710
And we cash in.

26:29.778 --> 26:31.712
You go after the deep pockets --

26:31.780 --> 26:34.781
The train company,
the city government, the state...

26:34.849 --> 26:37.384
Clear 100 grand without
even breaking a sweat.

26:37.451 --> 26:40.520
Someone gets killed, you could
add a couple of zeros to that.

26:40.588 --> 26:42.722
yeah, you're a big thinker.
That's why he's the boss, right?

26:42.790 --> 26:45.258
But a train, though -- dad,
we've never done anything --

26:45.325 --> 26:47.093
Shut up! Listen for once!

26:47.161 --> 26:48.361
Maybe you'll learn something.

26:48.429 --> 26:51.564
You come back in a couple days.

26:51.632 --> 26:53.500
I'll put a few guys together.

26:53.568 --> 26:54.801
We'll see if we can do this.

26:59.073 --> 27:00.140
I'm sorry.

27:00.207 --> 27:02.709
Would you mind popping this into my car?

27:02.777 --> 27:05.245
I'm just...So hot,

27:05.312 --> 27:07.547
And I really don't want
to leave it behind.

27:07.615 --> 27:08.615
No problem.

27:08.682 --> 27:09.883
Thank you.

27:17.224 --> 27:18.958
<i>The best place for a bug</i>

27:19.026 --> 27:21.560
<i>Is on something people keep with
them.</i>

27:21.628 --> 27:23.462
<i>Many car remotes these days</i>

27:23.530 --> 27:26.465
<i>Have enough space inside to
hide a small bug...</i>

27:30.202 --> 27:32.870
<i>...Not to mention a battery to
power the transmitter.</i>

27:35.907 --> 27:38.207
Sam, can you hear me?

27:41.044 --> 27:43.112
<i>It's a quick, efficient,
low-risk operation</i>

27:43.179 --> 27:45.414
<i>That costs as much as you
care to tip the valet.</i>

27:45.481 --> 27:46.781
Thank you.

27:51.086 --> 27:52.519
You got some serious balls,
you know that?

27:52.587 --> 27:54.254
I'm just trying to make
us some money. That's all.

27:54.322 --> 27:55.555
Yeah?

27:55.623 --> 27:57.390
Why don't you just slow down a little?

27:57.458 --> 27:58.591
You've been with us
for a couple days now,

27:58.659 --> 27:59.992
And you already act like you run things.

28:00.060 --> 28:01.594
Whatever problem you got with
your pop don't concern me.

28:01.661 --> 28:04.563
I don't have any problems
with my dad. All right?

28:04.631 --> 28:05.998
It's none of your business.

28:06.065 --> 28:08.099
All right, all right,
I'm just trying to help.

28:18.309 --> 28:20.009
You done fiddling with your car?

28:20.077 --> 28:21.644
uh, just fixing a taillight.

28:21.711 --> 28:24.214
I'm so glad your father's tools
are still getting some use.

28:24.281 --> 28:25.549
It always makes me sad

28:25.617 --> 28:27.518
To think of them sitting
there getting dusty.

28:27.585 --> 28:28.952
What happened to the charger?

28:29.020 --> 28:30.153
You know, just wear and tear.

28:31.322 --> 28:32.989
Whatever.

28:33.056 --> 28:36.291
I'll see you later!
I'm off to the beach with tina.

28:36.359 --> 28:37.926
<i>Tina? Mom, we talked about this.</i>

28:37.994 --> 28:40.095
We talked about the fact
that she's my friend.

28:40.162 --> 28:41.463
Oh, forget it.

28:41.530 --> 28:43.531
I'm not gonna wear my
bathing suit after all.

28:43.599 --> 28:45.966
It's too horrifying.

28:46.034 --> 28:47.534
Oh, hello!

28:47.602 --> 28:50.103
You're lucky to have a son
who's over here so much.

28:50.171 --> 28:52.538
<i>Yes, well, he was gone for a couple of
decades.</i>

28:52.606 --> 28:54.573
He's still making up for lost time.

28:54.641 --> 28:56.842
let's go!

28:59.045 --> 28:59.978
Yeah, sam.

29:00.046 --> 29:01.213
Bad news, mike.

29:01.281 --> 29:03.115
Uh, I've been monitoring
your buddy ryan's bug.

29:03.182 --> 29:04.382
And?

29:04.450 --> 29:05.917
Well, it sounds like he
decided to jump the gun

29:05.985 --> 29:07.385
And pull your "deathwish" scam himself.

29:07.452 --> 29:09.253
What? When? Right now, it sounds like.

29:09.320 --> 29:10.954
He's paying some poor
old guy to get knocked

29:11.022 --> 29:12.656
In front of the 5:35 commuter train.

29:12.724 --> 29:14.324
Sam, the 5:35 --

29:14.392 --> 29:15.925
Yeah, I know.

29:15.993 --> 29:17.659
They're headed toward the fifth
street crossing right now.

29:17.727 --> 29:19.061
I mean, look, I could call the cops --

29:19.128 --> 29:20.595
By the time they figure out
what the hell is going on...

29:20.663 --> 29:22.364
We can't risk it.
We got to get over there now!

29:22.432 --> 29:25.300
All right, I'll get myself
a new set of wheels.

29:25.368 --> 29:27.068
<i>When you work under a cover,</i>

29:27.136 --> 29:30.638
<i>Whether you're a cop, a d.E.
A. Agent, or a spy,</i>

29:30.705 --> 29:32.473
<i>You're getting into business
with the bad guys.</i>

29:34.643 --> 29:37.378
<i>Your job is to stay in control of that
business.</i>

29:38.946 --> 29:42.515
<i>The problem is, criminals
are unpredictable.</i>

29:42.581 --> 29:44.782
<i>Sometimes they take your
ideas and resources</i>

29:44.850 --> 29:47.017
<i>And hurt innocent people.</i>

29:47.085 --> 29:50.321
<i>It's every undercover agent's
worst nightmare...</i>

29:58.827 --> 30:00.727
<i>...Which is why you do
whatever it takes</i>

30:00.795 --> 30:02.429
<i>To make sure that doesn't happen.</i>

30:04.832 --> 30:08.201
<i>Boxing in a large vehicle and
forcing it into a crash</i>

30:08.268 --> 30:10.569
<i>Takes a coordinated group effort.</i>

30:10.637 --> 30:13.738
<i>It's a little like flying
planes in formation</i>

30:13.806 --> 30:15.606
<i>If one of the planes is
trying to get away --</i>

30:15.674 --> 30:17.908
<i>Very difficult and very, very
dangerous.</i>

30:26.350 --> 30:28.617
<i>The good news is that when a plan</i>

30:28.685 --> 30:31.253
<i>Requires clockwork timing and
precise movements...</i>

30:32.789 --> 30:36.023
<i>...It doesn't take much to
ruin that precision.</i>

30:45.199 --> 30:47.766
<i>Do it right, and you can avoid sending
anybody to the morgue.</i>

30:51.837 --> 30:54.705
<i>You may bruise a few egos,
though.</i>

31:03.001 --> 31:04.002
What the hell happened?

31:04.069 --> 31:05.703
Ryan jumped the gun on the train scam.

31:05.771 --> 31:07.638
We had to stop him before
he got someone killed!

31:07.706 --> 31:08.973
And?

31:09.040 --> 31:10.641
Well, nobody was hurt...

31:10.708 --> 31:11.841
But our cover was blown,

31:11.909 --> 31:13.642
And now ryan knows that his new recruit

31:13.710 --> 31:15.244
Is not who he imagined him to be.

31:15.311 --> 31:16.344
great.

31:16.412 --> 31:17.946
And now we've got nothing.

31:18.014 --> 31:19.213
I was just telling calia

31:19.281 --> 31:21.449
She'd be able to go home
for her son's birthday.

31:21.517 --> 31:23.551
Yeah, well, I've been listening
in on ryan's conversations,

31:23.619 --> 31:26.487
And daddy has put a halt to everything.

31:26.555 --> 31:28.623
I mean, they're not
making any new moves,

31:28.690 --> 31:29.824
Which, unfortunately, means

31:29.891 --> 31:31.325
They're gonna focus on all the irons

31:31.393 --> 31:32.626
They already have in the fire.

31:32.694 --> 31:33.927
Like my client.

31:33.995 --> 31:36.929
Sam, what would the cops need

31:36.997 --> 31:38.831
To build a case against these guys?

31:38.898 --> 31:42.033
You mean if they didn't catch
them red-handed? Mm-hmm.

31:42.101 --> 31:43.467
Well, the only thing we have

31:43.535 --> 31:45.769
Are the medical and insurance
records for calia's husband.

31:45.837 --> 31:47.137
If we're gonna nail these guys,

31:47.205 --> 31:48.572
We need the records on everybody

31:48.640 --> 31:49.840
That those doctors have treated.

31:51.309 --> 31:55.412
And if we're gonna save calia,
that's what we need.

31:55.480 --> 31:57.881
Mike, are you thinking what
I think you're thinking?

31:59.384 --> 32:01.985
<i>good luck with that, brother.</i>

32:02.053 --> 32:03.954
You can't be serious.

32:04.022 --> 32:05.922
Mom, I wish there was some other way.

32:05.990 --> 32:07.791
<i>She's my friend, michael!</i>

32:07.858 --> 32:09.960
You're asking me to
go back to my friend,

32:10.027 --> 32:12.896
A woman I tried on bathing
suits with, for god's sake,

32:12.964 --> 32:15.999
And -- and -- and blackmail
her into giving me documents?

32:16.066 --> 32:18.268
I told you there was a
reason not to get too close.

32:18.335 --> 32:21.504
Why? So I wouldn't feel bad
when I destroy a life?!

32:21.572 --> 32:24.140
Ma, these are bad guys!

32:24.208 --> 32:25.742
They're using desperate people!

32:25.809 --> 32:27.777
<i>Don't you talk to me about using
people!</i>

32:27.844 --> 32:29.111
You're asking me to force tina

32:29.179 --> 32:30.779
To sneak into the records office!

32:30.847 --> 32:32.447
She's gonna lose her job!

32:32.515 --> 32:34.182
And if she doesn't,
people will lose their lives!

32:37.319 --> 32:38.719
It's one job.

32:38.787 --> 32:41.356
I know it's not easy,
but if you do the math, mom --

32:41.424 --> 32:43.292
That's what this is, then?

32:43.360 --> 32:44.493
The math?

32:44.561 --> 32:45.728
Sometimes, yeah.

32:47.998 --> 32:50.499
Is this what you do, michael?

32:50.567 --> 32:52.801
You destroy good people?

32:52.869 --> 32:54.270
<i>My job is to help people.</i>

32:54.337 --> 32:56.171
And that can mean doing things

32:56.239 --> 32:58.173
That I wish I didn't have to do.

32:58.241 --> 33:01.676
And sometimes there's no other way.

33:01.744 --> 33:03.978
Now, you lived in the same house I did.

33:04.046 --> 33:05.713
<i>You made hard choices.</i>

33:07.682 --> 33:09.349
So you know this as well as I do.

33:12.853 --> 33:14.889
<i>When you're blackmailing someone,</i>

33:14.956 --> 33:16.891
<i>You have to be cruel to be kind.</i>

33:16.959 --> 33:18.826
<i>Show any sympathy for
your target,</i>

33:18.894 --> 33:20.361
<i>And you only make it worse.</i>

33:20.429 --> 33:22.030
<i>You have to be the bad guy.</i>

33:22.097 --> 33:23.965
<i>Let them feel they
have no choice.</i>

33:24.032 --> 33:25.199
<i>It's easier that way.</i>

33:25.267 --> 33:26.501
Maddy?

33:26.568 --> 33:28.703
<i>Easier for them, anyway.</i>

33:28.770 --> 33:30.404
How sweet of you to come by.

33:30.472 --> 33:31.639
Do you like my new haircut?

33:32.841 --> 33:34.208
Of course.

33:34.276 --> 33:36.377
Uh, tina, I wondered if we could talk.

33:36.445 --> 33:38.246
Sure. Come on back.

33:38.314 --> 33:39.514
What are you saying?

33:39.582 --> 33:41.250
I don't expect you to understand,

33:41.317 --> 33:44.152
But, tina, you've already given
me something you shouldn't,

33:44.220 --> 33:47.021
<i>Something you could get in a
lot of trouble for.</i>

33:47.089 --> 33:49.524
That information is confidential.

33:49.592 --> 33:51.826
I can't get that many files that fast

33:51.894 --> 33:53.428
Without anyone knowing.

33:53.496 --> 33:57.031
I don't want to hurt you,
but I need the documents.

33:57.099 --> 33:58.867
You don't want to hurt me?! Y--

33:58.934 --> 34:01.836
You are blackmailing me.

34:01.904 --> 34:04.305
You acted like you
were my friend, and...

34:07.776 --> 34:10.143
what kind of a person --

34:10.210 --> 34:11.312
Listen to me, tina.

34:11.380 --> 34:12.746
This will go a lot easier for you

34:12.815 --> 34:14.282
If you just do what I'm asking.

34:14.349 --> 34:16.650
So they'll find the documents missing.

34:16.719 --> 34:18.085
You can say you -- you misfiled them,

34:18.152 --> 34:19.152
You -- you forgot about them.

34:19.219 --> 34:20.154
I don't care what you say.

34:21.523 --> 34:25.058
<i>You know I'm going to
lose my job,</i>

34:25.126 --> 34:26.560
And you don't care.

34:26.628 --> 34:28.996
You play ball and don't
cause any problems,

34:29.063 --> 34:30.362
You can get another job.

34:39.840 --> 34:42.675
There. It's everything you asked for.

34:42.743 --> 34:44.043
Well...

34:44.110 --> 34:46.543
Well, mom, where are you going?
Don't you want a ride?

34:46.612 --> 34:48.446
I'll take the bus!

34:56.422 --> 34:57.489
Mike, how we doing?

34:57.557 --> 34:58.690
Good to go, sam.

34:58.758 --> 35:00.826
There's a city vehicle on holliston ave.

35:00.894 --> 35:03.029
Driver parked it, headed off to lunch.

35:03.096 --> 35:05.698
It's just sitting there,
waiting for a crash.

35:05.766 --> 35:08.168
You ready to do some driving? Oh, yeah.

35:08.236 --> 35:11.305
Oh, by the way, the documents
your ma picked up are perfect.

35:11.373 --> 35:13.674
Put this stuff in the right
place at the right time,

35:13.742 --> 35:16.211
Whole thing comes crumbling down.

35:18.214 --> 35:19.781
Fi, ryan's coming out of the bar.

35:19.849 --> 35:21.049
Are you good to go?

35:21.117 --> 35:23.551
Never been better. This should be fun.

35:23.619 --> 35:25.620
Yeah, just stay focused.

35:25.688 --> 35:28.690
My mother may never speak
to me again after this job,

35:28.758 --> 35:31.260
So I want to make sure it was worth it.

35:31.328 --> 35:33.496
All right, and...

35:33.564 --> 35:34.764
Go.

35:54.583 --> 35:57.518
<i>A push bar is a hardened
steel frame</i>

35:57.585 --> 35:59.886
<i>Attached to the front of a car.</i>

35:59.954 --> 36:01.754
<i>It's usually used by cops.</i>

36:01.822 --> 36:03.356
<i>But it's useful for anyone</i>

36:03.424 --> 36:05.758
<i>Who's planning on being in a hig
h-speed collision.</i>

36:10.795 --> 36:11.628
Oops!

36:37.016 --> 36:38.282
Yeah, baby!

36:38.350 --> 36:40.784
Hello, police?
I'm over on holliston avenue.

36:40.851 --> 36:42.085
There was a crash.

36:42.151 --> 36:44.215
There's a guy with a
goatee and well-dressed.

36:44.283 --> 36:46.980
Well, I think he crashed
into a city truck on purpose!

36:47.048 --> 36:49.516
He was waving a gun around in traffic.

36:49.583 --> 36:51.817
hell, boy, anyone ever
teach you how to park?

36:51.885 --> 36:53.085
you son of a bitch!

36:53.152 --> 36:54.686
<i>Me, son of a bitch?</i>

36:54.753 --> 36:56.955
You're the one who
tried to steal my scam

36:57.022 --> 36:59.223
And take it to daddy,
but it didn't help, did it?!

36:59.291 --> 37:01.492
Daddy knows you can't take it,
doesn't he?!

37:03.528 --> 37:06.931
<i>There's a tunnel vision that
people develop in a fight.</i>

37:06.998 --> 37:09.800
<i>They focus on their enemy, oblivious to
everything else.</i>

37:09.868 --> 37:12.302
<i>The angrier they get, the more intense
their focus.</i>

37:12.370 --> 37:15.405
<i>There comes a point where the
adrenaline is so intense,</i>

37:15.473 --> 37:19.042
<i>You could land a jet behind them
and they wouldn't notice.</i>

37:19.109 --> 37:21.143
Ce one, nice one. I'all done.

37:22.946 --> 37:25.714
You kn wt?

37:25.781 --> 37:28.282
I'm gonna go somewhere
where I'm appreciated.

37:49.502 --> 37:52.070
Get down on the ground!
Get down on the ground!

37:52.138 --> 37:53.805
Get your hands behind your head!

37:59.777 --> 38:01.210
Thank you so much.

38:01.278 --> 38:04.180
I-I still can't believe you
were able to take care of this.

38:04.247 --> 38:06.215
Oh, that's the reason people call me.

38:07.417 --> 38:08.150
And him.

38:08.218 --> 38:09.685
Are you sure it's safe?

38:09.752 --> 38:11.519
Are they really gone?

38:11.587 --> 38:13.554
the cops had a pretty good
basis for an investigation.

38:13.622 --> 38:15.756
Once things got going,
ryan turned on his father.

38:15.824 --> 38:17.091
They went after each other

38:17.158 --> 38:18.992
And practically handed
the case to the city.

38:20.194 --> 38:21.361
They'll be leaving you alone now.

38:21.429 --> 38:24.330
I have to pick up ben
from school, but...

38:24.398 --> 38:26.365
Thank you. Thank you so much.

38:30.470 --> 38:33.005
I spoke to your mom earlier.

38:33.073 --> 38:34.540
Yeah?

38:34.607 --> 38:36.074
She's still pretty upset.

38:37.944 --> 38:41.812
It was the right thing to do,
but that poor woman, tina?

38:41.879 --> 38:43.847
She'gonna lose everything.

38:43.915 --> 38:45.148
Michael...

38:45.216 --> 38:46.449
I'll see what I can do.

39:03.927 --> 39:05.527
Good morning, mom.

39:05.595 --> 39:07.596
Look who's here.

39:11.468 --> 39:14.236
I didn't sleep at all last night.

39:14.304 --> 39:16.638
I kept seeing tina's face...

39:16.706 --> 39:19.974
Her mascara all smeared from crying,

39:20.042 --> 39:21.943
Calling me a monster.

39:26.080 --> 39:28.648
Made me wonder how you've
ever been able to sleep at all

39:28.715 --> 39:29.749
The last two decades.

39:29.816 --> 39:31.317
Sometimes it's hard.

39:31.384 --> 39:33.218
that's not enough, michael.

39:33.286 --> 39:34.853
Mom, I came to --

39:34.921 --> 39:36.788
Who said that you get to decide
what's right and what's wrong?!

39:36.855 --> 39:39.390
And who gets sacrificed
for the greater good

39:39.457 --> 39:40.557
And who doesn't?!

39:40.625 --> 39:41.992
<i>Do you think I like it?</i>

39:42.059 --> 39:44.895
What can I do? People come to me.

39:44.963 --> 39:46.230
Oh, don't give me that, michael.

39:46.297 --> 39:48.131
You don't have to go running
around blowing things up

39:48.199 --> 39:50.166
Every time a problem comes your way.

39:50.233 --> 39:52.968
You were offered a job,
and you dragged me into it!

39:53.035 --> 39:55.103
You think I do this for the money?!

39:55.170 --> 39:55.770
Yes!

39:57.072 --> 39:58.572
I don't know. I don't.

40:03.077 --> 40:05.478
People need me.

40:05.545 --> 40:07.446
So I have to.

40:10.883 --> 40:13.117
Yes, I guess you do.

40:15.787 --> 40:17.954
I'm just tired.

40:25.594 --> 40:27.161
What are you doing here at 6:
00 in the morning?

40:27.229 --> 40:28.162
Where you been?

40:28.230 --> 40:30.331
County record building.

40:30.399 --> 40:32.399
There was a break-in.

40:32.467 --> 40:34.567
Someone went through all the files.

40:34.635 --> 40:36.269
They'll discover it Monday.

40:36.337 --> 40:38.372
Your friend tina, she'll be fine.

40:38.439 --> 40:41.274
Nobody will ever be able to
tell that she took any files.

40:45.345 --> 40:48.014
<i>Someone broke in?</i>

40:53.386 --> 40:54.720
Sun's come up.

40:56.222 --> 40:57.656
You want a cup of coffee?

41:17.711 --> 41:18.378
What's wrong, sam?

41:18.746 --> 41:20.513
Well, I've been doing some research,

41:20.581 --> 41:23.148
Trying to connect the dots
to find our killer, you know?

41:23.216 --> 41:24.916
So, there was the hotel thing, right?

41:25.483 --> 41:26.783
Then I followed up your hunch

41:26.851 --> 41:29.352
About that stadium
shooting in south america.

41:29.420 --> 41:32.355
Six police officials
shot in a soccer stadium,

41:32.422 --> 41:34.523
Six shots at the marine stadium.

41:34.591 --> 41:36.625
No one claimed credit for
either incident, though.

41:36.693 --> 41:38.360
Right. Thing is, you were off in bosnia

41:38.427 --> 41:39.694
When they did the follow-up,

41:39.762 --> 41:41.262
And both times, there was a lot of talk

41:41.330 --> 41:43.197
About the same guy -- mason gilroy.

41:43.265 --> 41:45.332
I've heard the name.

41:45.400 --> 41:47.667
Are you sure? Yep.

41:47.735 --> 41:50.136
There was some cologne on that
note you got at the hotel.

41:50.204 --> 41:52.505
Stuff is called monaco silver.

41:52.573 --> 41:53.772
Last sighting of gilroy?

41:53.840 --> 41:55.240
monaco.

41:55.308 --> 41:56.942
what a coincidence.

41:57.009 --> 41:58.409
So I came here to tell you...

41:58.777 --> 42:01.479
And I found this by the gate.

42:01.547 --> 42:03.482
He knows where you live, mike.

42:04.985 --> 42:06.552
And he didn't kill me yet.

42:09.388 --> 42:10.388
Gilroy.

42:10.456 --> 42:12.323
You figured out my name.

42:12.391 --> 42:14.158
Good for you. I knew
you were a clever boy.

42:14.226 --> 42:15.960
Are we done playing?

42:16.027 --> 42:18.094
That is the question, isn't it?

42:18.162 --> 42:20.364
I noticed you didn't sound the
alarm with the authorities,

42:20.432 --> 42:22.132
Which I think is a promising sign.

42:22.200 --> 42:24.634
I think... Perhaps we should meet.

42:24.701 --> 42:27.269
Just give me a time and a place.
