WEBVTT

00:10.513 --> 00:13.585
- Virus bitch going down?
- I'm working on it.

00:13.673 --> 00:16.062
Max and Logan getting busy?

00:16.152 --> 00:19.031
I wanna be able to shake his hand
without killing him.

00:19.113 --> 00:22.150
Why do doctors always have
such lousy handwriting?

00:22.233 --> 00:25.430
I paid that Manticore creep five grand
and what do I get?

00:25.513 --> 00:27.902
A bunch of scribblings I can't even read.

01:01.913 --> 01:04.825
Joshua, what are you doing?

01:04.913 --> 01:06.904
Helping.

01:08.673 --> 01:11.141
You wanna help?

01:12.793 --> 01:15.068
Get me another pencil.

01:15.153 --> 01:16.632
Pencil!

01:23.313 --> 01:27.101
I've read about your work
and I thought you might be able to help.

01:27.193 --> 01:29.184
A virus.

01:29.273 --> 01:32.504
Genetically targeted
to a specific gene sequence.

01:33.073 --> 01:35.871
Yeah. It's mine actually.

01:37.593 --> 01:40.232
Because someone wanted me dead.

01:40.313 --> 01:45.148
Doctor, please don't hang up. I am not a nut
and I am willing to pay you well. Hello?

01:55.313 --> 01:57.781
Pencil, pencil...

02:12.873 --> 02:14.943
"Burnt Sienna."

02:18.473 --> 02:20.782
"Chocolate Mousse."

02:21.713 --> 02:24.944
Candy. Trick and treat.

02:56.513 --> 02:57.832
Oh, pretty wack.

03:36.313 --> 03:38.031
Joshua?

03:40.153 --> 03:42.383
Joshua? You down here?

03:42.473 --> 03:44.464
Pencil.

03:46.393 --> 03:52.229
- What's up, big fella?
- Nothing. No pencil. Not anywhere.

03:52.313 --> 03:54.463
- What's that? Let me see.
- Nothing.

03:54.553 --> 03:56.544
Come on.

04:00.273 --> 04:02.423
Wow. Did you do that?

04:05.913 --> 04:10.782
- It's good. What is it?
- Father.

04:13.833 --> 04:18.111
Oh, I see the... Guess he was an art fan.

04:18.192 --> 04:22.232
Maybe when Father was mixing you
together, he put Picasso in your DNA.

04:22.313 --> 04:24.304
Picasso in my cocktail.

04:25.713 --> 04:28.352
This is good. A hobby.
Keep you outta trouble.

04:28.433 --> 04:31.106
- Lay low. Dangerous out there.
- That's right.

04:31.193 --> 04:33.229
People afraid of things that are different.

04:33.753 --> 04:38.543
We're not sure if he's specifically purposed
for something or just an experiment.

04:40.353 --> 04:46.383
So what is it you're meant to be?
Besides ugly?

04:47.753 --> 04:49.266
I'm talking to you.

04:50.113 --> 04:51.626
Sir!

04:54.713 --> 04:58.786
- Are you all right?
- Arrange for transport.

04:58.873 --> 05:03.071
Boys at Forensics have been itching to
take one of these transgenics apart alive.

05:03.153 --> 05:05.792
And they just got their wish.

05:06.753 --> 05:12.191
Yes, sir. This is Carson.
White wants this guy transported ASAP.

05:20.313 --> 05:21.348
Don't shoot!

05:25.673 --> 05:26.662
No!

05:40.393 --> 05:43.305
Never turn your back on them.

05:44.553 --> 05:46.193
They designed her to be the perfect soldier,
a human weapon.

05:46.193 --> 05:49.310
They designed her to be the perfect soldier,
a human weapon.

05:49.393 --> 05:51.304
Then she escaped.

05:51.393 --> 05:55.784
In a future not far from now,
in a broken world,

05:55.873 --> 05:58.228
she is haunted by her past.

05:58.313 --> 06:04.309
She cannot run.
She must fight to discover her destiny.

06:38.873 --> 06:42.343
You've reached the voice mail
for Donald Lydecker.

06:42.433 --> 06:44.389
Leave a message after the beep.

06:44.473 --> 06:49.866
It's me. Haven't gotten one of your
mysterious phone calls in a while.

06:49.953 --> 06:54.822
I was hoping maybe you could hook me up
with one of your doctor friends.

06:54.913 --> 06:57.268
Last one left town in a hurry.

06:57.353 --> 07:02.347
Said your former employers were
looking to terminate his contract.

07:03.433 --> 07:07.984
Anyhow, I'd really like to hear from you.

07:11.273 --> 07:14.663
Here, boy! Anybody home?

07:14.753 --> 07:18.268
- Max had to blaze.
- That's OK. Actually I came to see you.

07:18.353 --> 07:23.985
I scored a sweet deal on some ham hocks.
My buyer fell through. You want "em?

07:25.713 --> 07:27.351
I don't have any money.

07:27.433 --> 07:32.632
That's all right. Take it as an "I'm sorry"
for trying to kill you that one time.

07:32.713 --> 07:37.184
Hey, man, this is nice digs. This is...

07:37.273 --> 07:40.902
Oh wow, this is real nice.

07:43.993 --> 07:45.221
It's mine.

07:45.313 --> 07:48.589
- This could be worth some serious coin.
- It's good?

07:48.673 --> 07:53.701
Yeah. Look at that attention to detail.
You don't see that kind of work any more.

07:56.273 --> 07:58.264
Take it.

07:59.353 --> 08:01.913
No, those ham hocks aren't worth that much.

08:01.993 --> 08:04.427
I want you to.

08:05.673 --> 08:09.586
- Well, all right. Thanks.
- No, wait. Wait.

08:20.593 --> 08:23.630
- Joshua...
- All right.

08:23.713 --> 08:26.466
- OK.
- Enjoy your ham hocks.

08:26.553 --> 08:27.986
Ham hocks. Bye.

08:34.113 --> 08:36.785
I was wondering if I could raid your library.

08:36.873 --> 08:40.388
Go ahead. Listen, I was gonna give you a call.

08:40.472 --> 08:42.030
Yeah?

08:45.833 --> 08:48.711
- Organic chemistry?
- Bedtime reading.

08:48.793 --> 08:50.909
So what did you wanna talk to me about?

08:50.993 --> 08:54.668
I've been trying to get in touch with Lydecker.

08:54.753 --> 08:55.947
Lydecker? Why?

08:56.033 --> 08:59.787
Last time we talked he said something
about tracking down a lead.

08:59.873 --> 09:01.022
Sounds like him.

09:01.113 --> 09:05.584
I thought it was weird that he never got
back to me so I did some checking around.

09:06.473 --> 09:10.671
Police pulled an SUV
from the river about a month ago.

09:10.753 --> 09:15.269
The plates were registered to Lydecker
through a holding company.

09:15.353 --> 09:18.425
- He's dead?
- Well, they never found the body.

09:18.513 --> 09:20.629
Police say no one could've survived.

09:20.713 --> 09:23.944
- They don't know Lydecker.
- You sound almost hopeful.

09:24.033 --> 09:28.823
You spend ten years of your life running
from someone, you kinda miss 'em.

09:28.913 --> 09:32.223
- At least you still have White.
- Good old Ames.

09:32.313 --> 09:34.269
Somehow it's not the same with him.

09:34.353 --> 09:37.982
Anyway, I had Matt Sung pull
the police report. Check it out.

09:38.073 --> 09:41.952
Some pictures they found near
Lydecker's car. Looks like a dig site.

09:42.033 --> 09:43.393
I figure I'll run them through
a few archaeological databases.

09:43.393 --> 09:45.543
I figure I'll run them through
a few archaeological databases.

09:45.633 --> 09:49.592
- Might as well.
- Anyway, I gotta go see somebody.

09:49.673 --> 09:51.470
Business or pleasure?

09:51.553 --> 09:54.465
A woman contacted Eyes Only.

09:54.553 --> 09:56.748
Her son was kidnapped. Six years old.

09:56.833 --> 10:00.303
Sucks. Didn't know Eyes Only
did missing persons.

10:00.393 --> 10:03.669
She reached out through an informant
I've known for a long time.

10:03.753 --> 10:06.506
Police have dead-ended.
The Olsens are desperate.

10:06.593 --> 10:08.504
Her husband's a big-time ad exec.

10:08.593 --> 10:13.587
She's offered to make a donation to the
"Streaming Freedom Video Foundation".

10:13.673 --> 10:18.542
- Oh, how the mighty have fallen.
- Hey, even Eyes Only's got to pay the bills.

10:24.273 --> 10:26.309
I like it.

10:26.393 --> 10:29.908
Great. Let me just get
this outta the way for ya.

10:29.993 --> 10:33.781
Yes, please do. It's hideous. Astounding.

10:33.873 --> 10:38.788
- Look at the use of colour.
- Gold? My favourite.

10:38.873 --> 10:40.386
Well, some gold, yes,

10:40.473 --> 10:45.308
but it's the broad strokes
of cerulean and crimson

10:45.393 --> 10:48.430
commingled with found objects
and palimpsests

10:48.513 --> 10:52.347
that make this work of art so unique
and exciting. Don't you agree?

10:53.633 --> 10:56.272
- Oh, yeah.
- I'll give you six grand.

10:58.513 --> 11:00.105
Six grand?

11:02.033 --> 11:05.946
Fine. Seven. Agents.

11:06.033 --> 11:10.151
Enzo! Draw 7,000 from the safe
and lock this up.

11:10.473 --> 11:13.226
No, on second thought, you leave it here.

11:13.873 --> 11:16.785
I want to bask in its organic energy.

11:16.873 --> 11:22.823
Feast my eyes on its heroically
gargantuan impasto strokes.

11:22.913 --> 11:26.542
Grab some beer and some ham hocks,
you got yourself a party.

11:26.633 --> 11:28.544
I must meet this artist.

11:28.873 --> 11:31.865
I must meet... Joshua.

11:34.033 --> 11:36.672
- Hello, little boy?
- Yeah, yeah.

11:36.753 --> 11:39.142
He's shy.

11:41.713 --> 11:46.229
Listen, my clients don't just want
pictures to hang on their walls.

11:46.313 --> 11:49.225
They want the opportunity
to engage with the artist,

11:49.313 --> 11:53.101
to interact with minds more
creatively fertile than their own.

11:53.193 --> 11:57.709
Well, what can I say?
He's fertile, but he's a homebody.

11:57.793 --> 12:00.546
Well, at least tell me he's prolific.

12:01.673 --> 12:03.664
Thank you.

12:04.113 --> 12:07.549
Oh yeah, he's painting night and day.

12:07.633 --> 12:10.386
Can't get enough palimpsests
and cerulean paint

12:10.473 --> 12:12.987
to keep up with his bursting organic energy.

12:16.593 --> 12:20.142
That's it, Josh. Get ready.
Show me what you got.

12:20.233 --> 12:23.509
Beautiful! Hit it up on the left corner there.

12:23.593 --> 12:27.347
It looks great. Show me what you got.
Be one with the paint.

12:27.433 --> 12:30.743
- She liked it?
- You know what she loved? The colour.

12:30.833 --> 12:33.142
There you go. Toss it on there.

12:33.953 --> 12:38.071
You know what? The big gargantuan
impasto strokes... loved 'em.

12:38.153 --> 12:41.270
Get crazy. Go on. Do it up!

12:41.673 --> 12:43.868
Get crazy, Joshua!

12:45.553 --> 12:48.431
Oh, it's pretty! Hit it!

12:49.113 --> 12:49.353
Oh, it's beautiful.

12:49.353 --> 12:50.388
Oh, it's beautiful.

12:56.553 --> 12:59.021
- Joshua...
- What's the matter, Josh?

12:59.113 --> 13:00.387
...has a new face.

13:00.473 --> 13:04.102
- Oh, yeah?
- My work is my face, Alec!

13:05.273 --> 13:08.390
Yes. OK. You know what she liked?

13:08.473 --> 13:11.829
She liked the palimpsests,
the papers that are written on.

13:14.593 --> 13:17.551
These are the ones right here. These are great.

13:17.633 --> 13:21.308
Here we go. These are winners.
Look at that. What do you got for me?

13:21.393 --> 13:25.705
What do you got for me? What do you
got for me? I need some help. Help me!

13:32.873 --> 13:34.352
I got a headache.

13:35.753 --> 13:39.382
They took him in the middle of the night.
Right out of his room.

13:39.473 --> 13:41.862
We didn't hear a thing.

13:41.953 --> 13:46.231
- The police find any forensic evidence?
- Nothing.

13:46.313 --> 13:51.785
They think it was a professional job. We
have a video security system in the house.

13:51.873 --> 13:55.229
It caught a glimpse of someone,
but nothing we can make out.

13:55.313 --> 13:59.591
- I'd like to see it.
- There's a copy of it in here.

14:01.433 --> 14:06.109
Who could have done this? We're not
anybody important. We're new to Seattle.

14:06.193 --> 14:09.822
You haven't heard anything
from the kidnappers, no ransom note?

14:10.193 --> 14:13.629
OK. I may need to come by the house,
take a look around myself.

14:14.753 --> 14:18.712
It'll have to be during the day
when my husband's at work.

14:18.793 --> 14:21.227
He doesn't know that I'm here.

14:21.313 --> 14:24.032
The truth is, he doesn't
care much for Eyes Only.

14:24.113 --> 14:28.072
He thinks what you people do is subversive.

14:29.993 --> 14:31.187
It's OK.

14:32.113 --> 14:36.425
I tried to dig up anything
that would be of use to you.

14:36.513 --> 14:40.791
Birth certificate, medical files,
school records.

14:42.793 --> 14:45.626
He's such a smart little boy.

14:45.713 --> 14:49.023
He won a spelling contest when
he was four. Can you believe it?

14:49.113 --> 14:52.469
- The word was "chasm".
- I can't even spell that.

14:53.233 --> 14:55.872
That's him when he was three.

15:00.473 --> 15:03.192
He's a good-Iooking boy.

15:03.273 --> 15:05.946
We, uh...

15:06.033 --> 15:09.503
Iost our first two at childbirth.

15:09.593 --> 15:10.513
He's our whole world. Our miracle.

15:10.513 --> 15:13.311
He's our whole world. Our miracle.

15:13.393 --> 15:16.590
I don't understand.
On the birth certificate it says...

15:16.673 --> 15:20.427
Oh, yeah, that...
I go by my maiden name, Olsen.

15:20.513 --> 15:23.391
Ray goes by my husband's
last name, which is White.

15:24.713 --> 15:26.908
- Ames White?
- That's us.

15:27.953 --> 15:29.432
Happier times.

15:30.793 --> 15:34.024
Please find him. Find our son.

15:44.113 --> 15:47.264
Said she loved it even more than the first.

15:47.353 --> 15:52.029
Said she wants to get together and discuss
your blossoming artistic sensibility.

15:52.113 --> 15:53.307
Here you go.

15:53.393 --> 15:57.068
- Rita wants to meet me?
- Yeah, you did pretty well, huh?

15:57.153 --> 16:01.624
Joshua wants to meet Rita.
Discuss my blossoming.

16:01.713 --> 16:05.388
- Bad idea.
- Good idea. Good for my career.

16:05.473 --> 16:09.466
Look, Josh, you're a great artist, apparently.

16:09.553 --> 16:12.625
But you're also, to be frank, a dog-boy.

16:14.753 --> 16:15.742
Listen to me.

16:15.833 --> 16:20.304
One look at you and your benefactress
is gonna go running in fear for her life.

16:20.393 --> 16:23.510
That's gonna cut a blossoming
career off at it's knees.

16:23.593 --> 16:26.027
Not to mention future sales.

16:27.153 --> 16:29.621
People afraid of things that are different.

16:29.713 --> 16:34.389
What are you gonna do? Come on. Show
me some of that bursting organic energy.

16:37.673 --> 16:39.982
Josh, don't be like that, come on.

16:40.073 --> 16:43.622
Good morning, Joshua.
What are you doing here?

16:43.913 --> 16:48.623
Paying a friendly visit
to the artist-in-residence.

16:48.713 --> 16:50.988
I just stopped by to grab my papers.

16:54.833 --> 16:56.551
Focus, focus.

16:56.633 --> 17:00.342
- That's weird. They were right here.
- What'd they look like?

17:00.433 --> 17:03.948
White grid paper with scribblings all over it.

17:04.032 --> 17:05.989
Palimpsests.

17:07.153 --> 17:11.863
Pal upset? He's just worried
about you, that's all, the big lug.

17:11.953 --> 17:14.626
- Maybe they're down in the basement.
- Yeah.

17:17.073 --> 17:19.428
- It's Logan.
- That's important.

17:19.512 --> 17:23.665
You find out what it's about.
Michelangelo and I will find your papers.

17:27.473 --> 17:31.307
They gotta be around here somewhere, right?

17:31.393 --> 17:35.671
- Gotta help find virus bitch papers!
- OK, OK.

17:35.753 --> 17:37.903
Easy, easy, Josh.

17:41.113 --> 17:44.071
- It's him.
- So what do you think?

17:44.153 --> 17:48.669
- Bad things happen to bad people, too.
- She's not a bad person.

17:48.753 --> 17:52.462
- Married to him, isn't she?
- She doesn't know what he does.

17:52.553 --> 17:55.113
She doesn't see the blood on his shirts?

17:55.193 --> 17:58.185
If she knew, she wouldn't
have come to Eyes Only.

17:58.273 --> 18:01.390
She's scared, Max.
She's desperate to get her son back.

18:01.473 --> 18:04.943
Well, maybe if White wasn't so busy
trying to kill me and mine,

18:05.033 --> 18:07.672
he could do something about it.

18:09.353 --> 18:11.503
- You got that look.
- What look?

18:11.593 --> 18:13.902
Like you know more
and you're gonna tell me.

18:16.713 --> 18:21.104
From the Whites' security system.
Feed from the camera covering the backyard.

18:21.193 --> 18:25.471
Whoever took the boy must've spotted
the cameras, figured if they timed it,

18:25.553 --> 18:30.308
they could get in without being seen.
What they didn't figure on was this.

18:31.273 --> 18:33.992
- White's bad taste in landscaping?
- Hang on.

18:35.713 --> 18:38.910
I can correct for the spherical distortion.

18:39.553 --> 18:41.544
There.

18:47.873 --> 18:49.226
Transgenics.

18:49.313 --> 18:54.990
My guess is they couldn't get to White,
so they went after his kid as payback.

18:55.073 --> 18:57.064
White brought it on himself.

18:57.153 --> 19:00.623
Yeah, but the boy's innocent.
He can't help who his father is.

19:00.713 --> 19:04.911
I'm not asking you to get involved.
I wanted you to know what was going on.

19:04.993 --> 19:05.633
Wendy could be the next target. I'm gonna
warn her and help her get her son back.

19:05.633 --> 19:09.706
Wendy could be the next target. I'm gonna
warn her and help her get her son back.

19:09.793 --> 19:12.705
- How?
- You see this?

19:12.793 --> 19:15.102
- What is it?
- Some kind of badge or ID.

19:15.193 --> 19:18.629
I'm running the image
through an enhancement filter.

19:18.713 --> 19:22.308
With any luck, it will clear up
enough to be readable.

19:22.393 --> 19:24.509
In the meantime, I'm gonna go see Wendy

19:24.593 --> 19:27.630
before the man of the house
comes home for dinner.

19:27.713 --> 19:30.386
- I'm coming with you.
- You don't have to.

19:30.473 --> 19:33.863
Yes, I do. Otherwise I'm no better than he is.

19:39.073 --> 19:43.510
- You gotta be kidding.
- Alec, I'm so glad you dropped by.

19:43.593 --> 19:49.543
I have something to show you. Joshua
has been reviewed in the Artist's Weekly.

19:52.353 --> 19:54.628
"A staggering work of raw genius."

19:55.273 --> 19:58.583
"'Joshua number one' gives voice
to the angst of expressionism,

19:58.673 --> 20:01.426
while revelling in its spectacular ambiguity."

20:01.513 --> 20:04.107
"The medium is truly the message."

20:04.193 --> 20:07.026
That about sums it up.
Rita, about "number two"...

20:07.113 --> 20:08.671
When they view it, I have...

20:08.753 --> 20:11.870
Rita, we're gonna need
"Joshua number two" back.

20:11.953 --> 20:14.467
Well, I'm afraid that's not possible.

20:15.353 --> 20:18.743
- You sold it?
- No, no, it's part of my private collection.

20:20.953 --> 20:23.513
Well, it's at the artist's request.

20:24.513 --> 20:27.107
It has sentimental value, you know?

20:27.193 --> 20:30.947
- It should be all there.
- I couldn't bear to part with it.

20:31.033 --> 20:33.945
Perhaps if the artist would explain in person...

20:34.033 --> 20:36.183
That's not possible.

20:36.273 --> 20:38.343
Listen, Rita...

20:39.593 --> 20:42.266
What's it gonna take
to get that painting back?

20:45.113 --> 20:46.785
Two more?

20:46.873 --> 20:50.343
Straight trade. Said she'd
give us the other one back.

20:51.153 --> 20:55.590
Come on, come on. Burn daylight now.
Start flinging fuchsia, huh?

20:59.353 --> 21:00.353
Can't paint. What about Max?

21:00.353 --> 21:01.422
Can't paint. What about Max?

21:02.113 --> 21:05.628
You wanna help Max? Get your
ass in gear. I'll get you started.

21:05.713 --> 21:10.946
What do we need? A little paint?
Is that it? This has gotta work.

21:11.033 --> 21:13.069
See, it's all in the wrist.

21:16.433 --> 21:17.422
Good.

21:18.353 --> 21:21.470
Genetic engineering?
Government cover-up?

21:21.553 --> 21:25.466
Even if any of this was true,
Ames has nothing to do with it.

21:25.553 --> 21:29.068
He's been lying to you.
He's not who he claims to be.

21:29.153 --> 21:32.350
- I don't believe you.
- I'm sorry, but it's true.

21:32.433 --> 21:35.982
They took your son to hurt your husband
because he hurt them.

21:36.073 --> 21:37.745
My husband is a good man.

21:37.833 --> 21:39.744
- He put your son in danger.
- No.

21:39.833 --> 21:43.621
And as long as you stay here,
you're in danger, too.

21:45.593 --> 21:48.187
Get out. Both of you.

21:49.473 --> 21:53.785
- We just want to help you.
- Ames loves me. He loves Ray. He...

21:53.873 --> 21:58.310
...wonders what the hell
you're doing here, 452.

22:06.673 --> 22:10.427
Don't even think about it. On your knees.
Do it now, both of you.

22:10.513 --> 22:14.028
- Ames, what's going on?
- They didn't hurt you, did they?

22:14.113 --> 22:15.831
- Ames?
- What are you doing here?

22:15.913 --> 22:20.703
- I was about to ask you the same question.
- What the hell are you doing in my house?

22:20.793 --> 22:24.342
You're supposed to be at work, killing people.

22:24.433 --> 22:27.709
It's not true. Tell me none of it's true.

22:27.793 --> 22:31.342
- What did they tell you?
- Well, that you... that Ray...

22:35.273 --> 22:37.662
You've known all along, haven't you?

22:37.953 --> 22:43.073
You knew that these transgenics
took our son and you never told me?

22:47.793 --> 22:49.226
Ames!

22:50.513 --> 22:53.391
- You son of a bitch!
- You animals took my son!

22:53.473 --> 22:57.989
I should take you out, break your miserable
neck and pretend you never existed!

22:58.073 --> 23:00.951
But I'm not that kind of animal.

23:01.513 --> 23:06.712
- Ames, oh, God...
- I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

23:08.673 --> 23:10.823
Let's get out of here.

23:13.593 --> 23:15.584
Wait.

23:16.833 --> 23:20.143
We've got a lead on who took your son.
We can find him for you.

23:21.113 --> 23:23.991
You'd do that? Why?

23:24.073 --> 23:25.904
I'm not doing it for you.

23:25.993 --> 23:29.463
You deserve whatever pain life gives,
but your wife and son don't.

23:29.553 --> 23:34.308
They shouldn't have to suffer for
what you've done. We'll keep in touch.

23:49.953 --> 23:55.425
No. No, there's no passion here.
The contextualisation is poor.

23:55.513 --> 23:59.028
The juxtapositions are haphazard
and without focus.

23:59.113 --> 24:03.186
- They look just like the other ones.
- What?

24:03.273 --> 24:07.027
These two canvases together could
never equal the power and majesty

24:07.113 --> 24:09.149
of "Joshua number two".

24:09.233 --> 24:13.112
No, this happens sometimes.
An artist burns bright for an instant,

24:13.193 --> 24:16.071
then extinguishes like
a scrape of phosphorous.

24:16.153 --> 24:19.145
We'll call it his blue period.
It'll be worth a fortune.

24:19.233 --> 24:22.031
You know, if I could only talk to him,

24:22.113 --> 24:25.025
I might be able to help him
find his muse again.

24:25.113 --> 24:27.229
That's not gonna happen.

24:28.313 --> 24:30.873
Then I'm afraid the deal's off.

24:33.793 --> 24:37.627
Can't quite make it out yet,
but it shouldn't be too much longer.

24:38.313 --> 24:41.749
- You OK?
- Just thinkin'.

24:42.513 --> 24:45.869
I don't know what I was expecting
to see when we went there.

24:45.953 --> 24:51.823
It wasn't the Hallmark card house or the
pictures or the barbecue in the backyard.

24:51.913 --> 24:53.983
It all seemed so normal.

24:54.073 --> 24:56.792
We dropped a pretty big bomb
over there today.

24:56.873 --> 25:00.183
I'm guessing things won't be
so normal any more.

25:00.273 --> 25:01.865
But who knows?

25:01.953 --> 25:05.662
Maybe you doing this will
force White to get his head on straight.

25:05.753 --> 25:10.429
- Make him feel different about his calling.
- You're the eternal optimist, aren't you?

25:10.513 --> 25:10.713
- That's my nature.
- Yeah.

25:10.713 --> 25:14.228
- That's my nature.
- Yeah.

25:14.313 --> 25:18.386
Well, where White's nature is concerned,
I wouldn't count on it.

25:19.753 --> 25:23.143
Lost Max's papers. Lost my muse.

25:24.233 --> 25:25.427
Lost everything.

25:25.513 --> 25:28.710
No, Josh, you're career's not over, OK?

25:28.793 --> 25:33.389
Let me give you a little advice
from my brief sojourn in the art scene.

25:33.473 --> 25:37.785
It's all about supply and demand.
Rare doesn't just apply to meat, my friend.

25:38.873 --> 25:41.307
Look, you need to kick back, you know?

25:41.393 --> 25:44.829
You need to kick back,
stop painting, make "em wait.

25:44.913 --> 25:47.791
They'll be bustin' down
your door for a "Joshua".

25:47.873 --> 25:50.512
No, no. Virus bitch going down.

25:51.273 --> 25:54.151
I need to get "Joshua number two" back.

25:57.993 --> 25:59.028
Steal it.

26:00.633 --> 26:03.022
Steal it. Yeah. Can we open a window?

26:03.113 --> 26:05.707
The paint fumes are
turning your brain into oatmeal.

26:05.793 --> 26:10.389
- Sneak, sniff, steal it! Huh?
- Listen to me, listen to me, OK?

26:10.473 --> 26:13.465
If we jack that painting,
Rita's gonna know it was us.

26:13.553 --> 26:16.625
OK? That's a career-ender. Not the plan.

26:19.753 --> 26:22.586
When we sell paintings,
you can get Max a new doctor.

26:22.673 --> 26:26.552
You can buy her a whole hospital.
Just tell her you lost the papers.

26:26.633 --> 26:29.989
I don't know, tell her your dog ate "em.
Tell her you ate "em.

26:30.073 --> 26:32.792
Max will get over it, all right?
You know why?

26:32.873 --> 26:37.788
Because underneath that sadomasochistic
leather and tough image, she's a big softy.

26:38.753 --> 26:41.142
- Joshua?
- OK, I gotta go.

26:45.673 --> 26:47.664
What's up, big fella?

26:50.833 --> 26:53.427
Any luck finding my papers?

26:56.033 --> 26:58.706
I'll take that as a no.

26:58.793 --> 27:02.547
- Alec sold my paintings and...
- Your paintings?

27:02.633 --> 27:08.105
- Yeah, they rocked, for a while.
- Wow, that's great!

27:11.233 --> 27:15.590
Max and Joshua have to talk
about paintings now.

27:16.233 --> 27:18.224
Hold on.

27:18.313 --> 27:21.111
- Yeah?
- Max, got the whole image completed.

27:21.193 --> 27:26.142
It's an ID badge for an outfit called
RCF Environmental Clean-up and Disposal.

27:26.233 --> 27:29.828
Got an address for a site they're
working on downtown: 5th and Grand.

27:29.913 --> 27:31.710
Got it.

27:32.393 --> 27:35.863
I gotta go. We can talk later, I promise.

28:03.593 --> 28:06.710
It's OK. I'm Manticore. X5-452.

28:12.553 --> 28:17.786
I know you took White's kid.
I saw the surveillance footage.

28:20.113 --> 28:25.141
I don't like the guy myself, but you can't
just go around grabbing people's kids.

28:36.753 --> 28:39.142
Let me guess. You're with him.

29:16.073 --> 29:18.223
Who the hell are you people?

30:11.633 --> 30:16.229
There's some pictures they found
near Lydecker's car.

30:18.673 --> 30:21.392
Looks like some kind of dig site.

30:27.993 --> 30:29.346
The Manticore symbol.

30:33.593 --> 30:37.632
They didn't have bar codes. They fought
differently. They're not transgenics.

30:37.713 --> 30:41.228
- I couldn't hurt them. How strange is that?
- It got more strange.

30:41.313 --> 30:45.670
The place you found is a Kiloma
burial ground from the early 1800s.

30:45.753 --> 30:49.666
- Why was the Manticore symbol there?
- Good question.

30:49.753 --> 30:55.544
Found another one in a Mesopotamian
burial chamber, 5000 BC.

30:57.073 --> 31:01.942
Another one in an Andean tomb
in Atacama, Chile, 2000 BC.

31:02.033 --> 31:07.061
Second-century Etruscan catacombs,
seventh-century Northumbrian Celtics,

31:07.153 --> 31:10.225
- Like a virus down through history.
- What does it mean?

31:10.313 --> 31:13.225
All I can figure is that Manticore
or some precursor

31:13.313 --> 31:15.543
has been around longer than we realised.

31:15.633 --> 31:20.184
They weren't doing genetic engineering
in Mesopotamia. Didn't have the hardware.

31:20.273 --> 31:21.513
Maybe not. But you just
got your ass handed to you

31:21.513 --> 31:22.832
Maybe not. But you just
got your ass handed to you

31:22.913 --> 31:26.428
by a couple of guys hanging
around an Indian burial site.

31:26.513 --> 31:28.902
What's Lydecker's connection to this?

31:28.993 --> 31:33.942
I don't know. He had pictures from the
place the kidnappers were holding the kid.

31:34.033 --> 31:38.743
- You don't think he's behind all this?
- We don't even know if he's still alive.

31:38.833 --> 31:42.906
I've been trying to hack into his voice mail.
Maybe something'll turn up.

31:42.993 --> 31:47.783
In the meantime
I'm gonna pay White a surprise visit.

31:47.873 --> 31:50.706
Could be he knows
a lot more than he's telling.

32:00.073 --> 32:02.541
- You scared me.
- I'm sorry.

32:03.513 --> 32:05.504
I didn't hear you come in.

32:17.193 --> 32:19.184
Wendy...

32:22.353 --> 32:24.344
I better get that.

32:29.193 --> 32:34.472
Hello? Yes? My son. Who is this?

32:34.993 --> 32:37.746
Ames, is it Ray? Don't make them mad!

32:37.833 --> 32:40.028
How much do you want?

32:40.113 --> 32:42.752
How do we even know he's alive?

32:42.833 --> 32:44.630
Ray?

32:44.713 --> 32:46.066
Honey, it's Mommy!

32:46.153 --> 32:48.189
Don't worry, pal, we're coming.

32:48.273 --> 32:50.912
Hello? Hello?

32:50.993 --> 32:52.984
Yes.

32:53.953 --> 32:55.944
Yes.

32:57.873 --> 32:59.864
We'll be there.

33:01.793 --> 33:04.990
- Should we call the police?
- No, they said to come alone.

33:05.073 --> 33:07.223
If we don't, they'll kill him.

33:37.233 --> 33:42.068
Wen, you know I love you, right?

33:45.033 --> 33:47.024
I know.

33:52.353 --> 33:53.786
- What's up?
- Where are you?

33:53.873 --> 33:58.071
I followed 'em. They left the house.
I think they're gonna meet the kidnappers.

33:58.153 --> 34:03.466
I got into Lydecker's voice mail. There's
a message there from some archaeologist.

34:03.553 --> 34:07.466
Something's wrong. Where are they?

34:07.993 --> 34:10.063
They're not coming.

34:11.273 --> 34:14.150
What do you mean? How do you know?

34:14.233 --> 34:19.148
- I staged this whole thing.
- What? You did this?

34:20.193 --> 34:24.822
- Where's Ray? I want my son!
- He's not your son any more.

34:24.913 --> 34:29.031
There was genetic breeding going on.
Women were forced to have children.

34:29.112 --> 34:32.422
You were chosen for me.
The earlier ones did the smart thing

34:32.513 --> 34:36.552
and they got rid of the
breeding host right away.

34:37.152 --> 34:39.507
I made one mistake.

34:40.672 --> 34:43.505
- I fell in love with you.
- Oh, no...

34:43.592 --> 34:46.585
But you just couldn't leave things alone.

34:46.672 --> 34:49.745
When I had Ray taken, you couldn't accept it.

34:50.513 --> 34:54.426
You had to go out and find him on your own.

34:54.513 --> 34:57.550
Always in threes.
They kill the first two newborns.

34:57.633 --> 35:01.182
Max, the Whites had
two miscarriages before Ray.

35:02.713 --> 35:06.183
I didn't want it to end like this,
but now I don't have a choice.

35:06.273 --> 35:08.343
As far as the police'll be concerned,

35:08.433 --> 35:11.664
we came to meet the men who took our son.

35:11.753 --> 35:14.825
They double-crossed us and you were killed.

35:14.913 --> 35:16.983
At the end, they kill the mother.

35:17.073 --> 35:19.382
I took a bullet myself.

35:20.673 --> 35:24.507
- What are you?
- I am the future.

35:27.233 --> 35:29.508
Goodbye, my love.

35:41.833 --> 35:43.273
Haven't you done enough?

35:43.273 --> 35:43.546
Haven't you done enough?

35:48.673 --> 35:53.144
Surprised? You think you and your
little Manticore progeny are special?

35:59.153 --> 36:00.791
Transgenic scum!

36:02.033 --> 36:06.948
You think those geeks with their
chemistry sets and their gene banks

36:07.033 --> 36:09.866
have their greasy little paws in the future?

36:14.153 --> 36:18.271
- You don't know what you're up against.
- I should've cancelled your ass.

36:18.353 --> 36:20.821
You couldn't because you're too weak.

36:24.753 --> 36:26.630
Pain is a phantom of the mind.

37:06.033 --> 37:08.183
Hold it right there!

37:10.833 --> 37:14.667
That's an expensive and important
piece you've got there, Mister.

37:14.753 --> 37:15.902
I know.

37:18.473 --> 37:22.102
Joshua? Is that you?

37:22.673 --> 37:25.267
My painting. "Joshua number two."

37:25.353 --> 37:28.470
I told your representative
you could have the painting

37:28.553 --> 37:29.433
if you'd just ask for it in person.

37:29.433 --> 37:31.151
If you'd just ask for it in person.

37:32.873 --> 37:36.912
Here I am. In person. Give it back.

37:36.993 --> 37:39.587
Yeah, but can't I see you?

37:45.393 --> 37:48.942
Joshua, just let me see you,
and you can take the painting back,

37:49.033 --> 37:50.830
and I'll square it with the cops.

37:50.913 --> 37:53.825
- Cops?
- Yeah, you tripped the alarm.

37:53.913 --> 37:56.632
- They're on their way.
- Oh, very wack.

37:58.193 --> 38:01.868
Joshua, it doesn't matter
to me what you look like.

38:01.953 --> 38:05.468
No. Screaming. Running for your life!

38:05.553 --> 38:08.909
Joshua, it doesn't matter.

38:08.993 --> 38:11.063
I promise you.

38:28.913 --> 38:31.143
It all makes sense now.

38:31.233 --> 38:33.793
Your work, your early paintings...

38:35.153 --> 38:40.307
They were the expressions of an artist
literally seeing the world for the first time.

38:40.713 --> 38:43.546
Ajoyous celebration of life and freedom.

38:43.633 --> 38:47.512
But now you've realised you can't
be a part of this world. Not really.

38:48.553 --> 38:52.387
People afraid of what they don't understand.

38:52.993 --> 38:54.870
You're too good for us, Joshua.

38:55.313 --> 38:59.192
Paint for yourself. Create because
that's what your soul does to survive.

38:59.273 --> 39:02.743
But don't do it for us.
We don't deserve you.

39:04.793 --> 39:07.865
- You're special.
- Special. First.

39:12.513 --> 39:16.062
You are...

39:17.713 --> 39:22.184
the one and only...

39:23.393 --> 39:24.872
Joshua.

39:35.393 --> 39:37.907
She's not safe.
We have to get her out of town.

39:37.993 --> 39:39.870
What about White?

39:39.953 --> 39:42.786
I called Matt Sung.
Had him check out the house.

39:42.873 --> 39:45.467
Big surprise. No sign of him.

39:45.553 --> 39:47.703
So he goes back to his government job

39:47.793 --> 39:51.672
for the secret government agency
nobody's ever heard of. Untouchable.

39:51.753 --> 39:55.223
This group he's involved with
knows how to cover their tracks.

39:55.313 --> 39:59.704
They've had practice. They've been
doing it for a couple of thousand years.

39:59.793 --> 40:01.670
Question is...

40:01.753 --> 40:05.905
What's this breeding programme
all about and who's behind it?

40:05.993 --> 40:08.223
And what do they want with Ray?

40:10.673 --> 40:16.305
- Did I do good?
- You did real good, Ray. Real good.

40:16.393 --> 40:20.181
- Your mom didn't suspect a thing.
- I wish she would understand.

40:20.273 --> 40:24.232
Me too. But it had to be this way.

40:24.313 --> 40:27.305
It's time for you to be
with other people like us.

40:27.393 --> 40:30.112
- Will you come visit?
- When the time comes.

40:35.833 --> 40:38.301
I love you.

40:38.393 --> 40:41.032
And I'll think about you all the time.

40:45.513 --> 40:47.708
You be good now.

42:34.033 --> 42:36.069
