00:01.835 --> 00:01.868
Na

00:01.868 --> 00:02.402
rrator: This is the Evergreen

00:02.402 --> 00:03.103
rrator: This is the
Evergreen forest.

00:03.837 --> 00:06.272
Quiet, peaceful, serene.

00:08.508 --> 00:10.510
That is, until
Bert Raccoon wakes up.

00:10.510 --> 00:12.112
Bert Raccoon: Yahoooo!

00:13.480 --> 00:15.615
Yeeeehaaaa!

00:16.683 --> 00:17.751
Yikes!

00:18.418 --> 00:20.086
Yaaaah...

00:22.489 --> 00:23.990
Yeaaaah!

00:23.990 --> 00:26.893
Luckily, he has some
good friends to help him out.

00:34.467 --> 00:36.703
Life would be simple
in the forest except for...

00:38.271 --> 00:39.506
Cyril Sneer!

00:43.309 --> 00:45.378
And his life would be simple
except for...

00:46.246 --> 00:47.847
the Raccoons!!

00:47.847 --> 00:49.215
♪ (show theme music) ♪

01:02.562 --> 01:04.397
What?! Are you sure?

01:04.397 --> 01:07.133
That matter should've been
cleared up hours ago!

01:08.234 --> 01:09.969
You!!

01:09.969 --> 01:11.938
Pig 1: Y-yes, Sir?

01:11.938 --> 01:14.040
The Smith
Brother's portfolio!

01:14.040 --> 01:15.041
Cough it up!

01:15.041 --> 01:17.710
Pig 1: I have no idea,
where that is, Sir.

01:17.710 --> 01:19.479
A-a-ah-choo!

01:19.479 --> 01:21.214
You,
oversized bacon bits

01:21.214 --> 01:23.316
couldn't find
bubblegum under a seat

01:23.316 --> 01:24.350
in a movie theatre!

01:24.350 --> 01:26.719
Pig 2: S-s-s-so-sorry,
Sir.

01:26.719 --> 01:27.821
Cedric!

01:28.588 --> 01:29.823
Yes, Pop?

01:29.823 --> 01:32.625
There's ten cents
unaccounted for in these books!

01:32.625 --> 01:33.726
But Pop,

01:33.726 --> 01:35.929
they've been balanced
twice already.

01:35.929 --> 01:37.997
That ten cents is a mystery

01:37.997 --> 01:40.366
I just can't seem to solve.

01:40.366 --> 01:41.935
Well, what can you do?

01:41.935 --> 01:44.838
I expect results and
you're not delivering.

01:44.838 --> 01:47.607
Why can't you do anything right?

01:47.607 --> 01:50.944
Gosh, Pop.
I try as hard as I can.

01:50.944 --> 01:52.779
Can I go now?

01:52.779 --> 01:54.414
Go, go!

01:54.414 --> 01:56.783
Can't anyone do anything right?

01:59.018 --> 02:00.253
Pig 1: Ahh-choo!!

02:01.221 --> 02:04.057
Um, uhmmm...

02:04.057 --> 02:05.225
Okay guys,

02:05.225 --> 02:06.826
now listen, we gotta...

02:06.826 --> 02:09.262
Hey Cedric, where ya been?

02:09.262 --> 02:11.397
The game stared hours ago!

02:11.397 --> 02:13.466
Sorry I'm late.

02:13.466 --> 02:17.570
Pop is having an especially
hard time of things today.

02:17.570 --> 02:19.305
Well, c'mon, Cedric.

02:19.305 --> 02:20.707
It's the last play of the game

02:20.707 --> 02:23.209
and we need a touchdown
to win this thing!

02:23.743 --> 02:26.279
Okay. Ralph and Melissa,

02:26.279 --> 02:27.714
you guys do a criss-cross.

02:27.714 --> 02:29.349
Schaeffer, you do a buttonhook.

02:29.349 --> 02:31.885
And Cedric, do a
down and out and down.

02:31.885 --> 02:34.254
Everyone else, run interference!

02:34.254 --> 02:36.089
Okay. Break!

02:38.825 --> 02:41.794
36! 24! 36!

02:41.794 --> 02:43.129
Hut! Hut! Hut!

02:45.598 --> 02:46.599
Aaa-agh!

02:48.568 --> 02:51.237
Cyril's Voice: You can't
do anything right!!!

02:52.305 --> 02:53.640
Ooph! Ouch!

02:55.408 --> 02:57.644
Oaaah, Cedric!

02:57.644 --> 02:59.679
A perfect touchdown pass

02:59.679 --> 03:01.981
and you blew it!

03:01.981 --> 03:04.784
Cyril' Voice: "You can't do
anything right!!"

03:04.784 --> 03:06.152
Sorry, Bert.

03:07.253 --> 03:09.522
I can't do anything right!

03:09.522 --> 03:12.258
I guess I'm just useless.

03:13.760 --> 03:17.030
I've got more deals going
than a discount store.

03:17.030 --> 03:19.165
Why, if I had a competent staff,

03:19.165 --> 03:21.868
Sneer Enterprises could
be a household word!

03:21.868 --> 03:23.369
Like 'payday'!

03:23.369 --> 03:25.305
If only there were two of me,

03:25.305 --> 03:26.639
then I could show them!

03:26.639 --> 03:30.143
If only Cedric showed
the proper spirit.

03:30.143 --> 03:32.679
I haven't been tough
enough on that boy!

03:32.679 --> 03:34.547
Why if I had the time I'd...

03:35.114 --> 03:36.482
Wait a minute!

03:36.482 --> 03:39.319
I can do it without
having to waste a second!

03:39.319 --> 03:41.287
I'll send him away to somewhere

03:41.287 --> 03:43.456
where they'll teach
him the three b's:

03:43.456 --> 03:46.192
Big, Big, Bucks!

03:46.192 --> 03:48.695
And then, once Cedric gets back,

03:48.695 --> 03:50.530
there will be two of me!

03:50.530 --> 03:53.533
heheheheh!!

03:54.801 --> 03:58.538
Cedric, you gotta show
more confidence in yourself!

03:58.538 --> 04:00.073
But gee, Bert.

04:00.073 --> 04:02.141
You've got everything
going for you.

04:02.141 --> 04:05.211
You're smart, you belong
to a successful family,

04:05.211 --> 04:06.913
you're fun to be around.

04:06.913 --> 04:08.181
Thanks Bert, but...

04:08.181 --> 04:10.717
You've got to take
charge of yourself, Cedric.

04:10.717 --> 04:12.418
Be your own boss!

04:12.418 --> 04:14.354
Stand on your own two feet!

04:14.354 --> 04:16.055
Well, okay.

04:16.055 --> 04:18.891
I think what Bert's
trying to say, Cedric, is

04:18.891 --> 04:21.527
don't let people
tell you what to do.

04:21.527 --> 04:23.029
Stick up for yourself!

04:24.230 --> 04:27.066
Gee,
being self-assertive.

04:27.066 --> 04:30.503
Uh, would that be
okay with you, guys?

04:30.503 --> 04:33.206
It never hurts
to be self-assertive.

04:33.206 --> 04:36.409
A new outlook just might
be good for you, Cedric.

04:36.409 --> 04:37.577
Besides, Cedric,

04:37.577 --> 04:40.880
nothing you could do
could ever be bad.

04:40.880 --> 04:43.416
I suppose a
little self-confidence

04:43.416 --> 04:45.285
could go a long way.

04:45.285 --> 04:48.154
Yeah! Like uh,
maybe to the end zone?

04:51.858 --> 04:53.126
Maybe, Bert's right.

04:53.126 --> 04:56.796
I should better myself and stick
up for myself a little more.

04:58.064 --> 05:02.602
I just have to do something
about my self confidence.

05:02.602 --> 05:05.738
And right now is
as good a time as any!

05:05.738 --> 05:08.775
I'll start by doing
something I want to do.

05:08.775 --> 05:12.545
If I don't believe in
myself, who else will?

05:12.545 --> 05:14.647
Cedric!
Haha! There you are!

05:14.647 --> 05:15.915
I've been looking for you

05:15.915 --> 05:17.550
for the past two hours!

05:17.550 --> 05:19.886
I went for
a long walk, Pop.

05:19.886 --> 05:22.155
I had some things to think over.

05:22.155 --> 05:24.724
And you can finish
thinking them over on the train!

05:24.724 --> 05:26.559
Train? What train?

05:26.559 --> 05:29.262
The one that's taking you
to Improve University.

05:29.262 --> 05:31.064
Improve U?

05:31.064 --> 05:32.432
Here's their brochure.

05:32.432 --> 05:34.334
"Improve University,

05:34.334 --> 05:36.469
we make mountains
out of molehills".

05:36.469 --> 05:38.504
Confidence
building school

05:38.504 --> 05:40.473
sounds like a good idea, Pop.

05:40.473 --> 05:45.311
But I was thinking, I always
wanted to go to cooking school.

05:45.311 --> 05:46.346
Uah!

05:46.346 --> 05:48.681
You know, start
with brussel sprouts,

05:48.681 --> 05:51.517
and work my way up to cabbage?

05:51.517 --> 05:54.187
Cooking?!
You'll be cooking all right.

05:54.187 --> 05:57.490
Great schemes to make
this company more money!

05:57.490 --> 05:59.525
Ha! Now let's get a move on.

05:59.525 --> 06:01.527
You leave at 4:20 sharp!

06:01.527 --> 06:05.431
Sure, Pop, but may I
call my friends first?

06:05.431 --> 06:07.467
Alright,
but make it snappy.

06:07.467 --> 06:09.702
Destiny is not
to be kept waiting!

06:09.702 --> 06:11.537
You'll learn that at Improve U.

06:14.807 --> 06:16.476
Have fun, Cedric!

06:16.476 --> 06:19.011
Fun? There
won't be time for fun!

06:19.011 --> 06:22.215
The efficiency courses at
Improve U will see to that!

06:22.215 --> 06:24.617
Gee, Pop, I don't know.

06:24.617 --> 06:26.185
Don't worry, Cedric.

06:26.185 --> 06:29.055
This confidence building school
could be the best thing

06:29.055 --> 06:30.556
that's ever happened to you!

06:30.556 --> 06:31.791
Believe me!

06:34.026 --> 06:35.461
So long, Cedric.

06:35.461 --> 06:36.896
We'll miss you!

06:36.896 --> 06:38.297
I'll say you'll miss him!

06:38.297 --> 06:40.032
He'll never be the same again!

06:40.032 --> 06:41.467
By the time he gets back,

06:41.467 --> 06:43.703
Cedric will be all Sneer!

06:45.571 --> 06:47.039
Goodbye everyone!

06:47.039 --> 06:49.375
Goodbye!
Bye!

06:49.375 --> 06:53.246
Gee, I sure hope this
is the right thing for Cedric.

07:01.687 --> 07:04.724
Gee, it'll be great
to see old Cedric again.

07:04.724 --> 07:07.160
You mean, the
"new and improved" Cedric.

07:07.160 --> 07:09.529
I've planned
a football game,

07:09.529 --> 07:12.765
so I can throw him that
winning touchdown pass!

07:12.765 --> 07:14.867
Look!
There's Cedric now!

07:14.867 --> 07:17.103
I hardly recognize him!

07:17.103 --> 07:21.240
Let's see..."when
making a first impression,

07:21.240 --> 07:25.111
one must look as
efficient as possible".

07:25.111 --> 07:27.046
Huh? Cedric?!

07:27.046 --> 07:29.048
Ehm-ehm, conductor,

07:29.048 --> 07:31.551
this train is four minutes late!

07:31.551 --> 07:34.086
How can I give the people
I'm supposed to meet

07:34.086 --> 07:35.888
my undivided attention,

07:35.888 --> 07:38.324
if I can't make my
appointments?!

07:38.324 --> 07:40.526
Sounds like
Cedric's really learned

07:40.526 --> 07:42.261
to take charge of himself.

07:42.261 --> 07:44.897
Hah! What
did I tell ya!

07:44.897 --> 07:47.767
Hiya, Cedric!
Welcome back!

07:47.767 --> 07:50.636
Oh hi, Bert!
Hi gang! Good to see you!

07:50.636 --> 07:53.072
Say, how'd you like to
play a little football tomorrow?

07:53.072 --> 07:54.373
Huh? It's all set!

07:54.373 --> 07:57.276
Hmmm,
"play is encouraged,

07:57.276 --> 07:59.779
but must be dealt
with efficiently".

07:59.779 --> 08:02.114
Uh, watcha
got there, Cedric?

08:02.114 --> 08:04.083
This is my manual, Bert.

08:04.083 --> 08:07.620
At Improve U, your manual
is your best friend.

08:07.620 --> 08:10.690
Now about that football game,

08:10.690 --> 08:15.561
I can squeeze you in at 2:00
o'clock next Saturday?

08:15.561 --> 08:19.565
"Squeeze me in"?
Next Saturday?

08:19.565 --> 08:21.701
Oh, is that
a problem, Bert?

08:21.701 --> 08:26.072
Huh? Uh no,
not at all Cedric.

08:26.072 --> 08:28.975
Just calling your
own shots, I guess.

08:28.975 --> 08:31.944
Well uh, 2:00
o'clock next Saturday it is.

08:31.944 --> 08:34.213
Oh hello, father.

08:34.213 --> 08:36.148
Thanks for coming, guys!

08:36.148 --> 08:38.584
See you next Saturday
2:00 o'clock sharp!

08:39.418 --> 08:41.988
Cedric seems
so sure of himself.

08:41.988 --> 08:45.858
Cedric my boy, you're
looking like a new man!

08:45.858 --> 08:47.827
"When
attempting to impress,

08:47.827 --> 08:51.631
always make your first
move a forceful one".

08:51.631 --> 08:53.666
Easy on the "hello's" Pop.

08:53.666 --> 08:55.134
There's work to be done!

08:55.134 --> 08:59.639
Pig 1: My! Master Cedric has
become nothing to 'Sneer' at.

08:59.639 --> 09:02.108
Pig 1/Pig 2:

09:02.108 --> 09:03.809
Now listen up you three:

09:03.809 --> 09:05.945
stop trading idle chatter

09:05.945 --> 09:07.513
and collect those bags

09:07.513 --> 09:09.315
or the next thing
you'll be collecting

09:09.315 --> 09:11.817
will be unemployment cheques!

09:11.817 --> 09:12.985
Got that?!

09:12.985 --> 09:15.454
Y-yes s-Sir! Y-yes s-Sir!

09:15.454 --> 09:17.223
Anything you say, Sir!

09:17.223 --> 09:19.458
Cedric! Wonderful of you

09:19.458 --> 09:21.694
to out-bully your
father like that!

09:21.694 --> 09:23.362
Gee, sorry, Pop.

09:23.362 --> 09:26.666
I guess I'm showing a
little too much initiative.

09:26.666 --> 09:30.002
Nonsense!
You're doing just fine son.

09:30.002 --> 09:32.405
Show all the initiative
you want, Cedric.

09:32.405 --> 09:33.739
Thanks, Pop.

09:33.739 --> 09:35.641
Now, let's get to work!

11:01.761 --> 11:04.196
Gee Cedric, so soon?

11:04.196 --> 11:05.631
But this
is the first time

11:05.631 --> 11:07.633
we've seen you
since you got back.

11:07.633 --> 11:09.502
No time to argue, guys.

11:10.269 --> 11:14.306
It's not productive, according
to my Improve U manual.

11:14.306 --> 11:16.909
Let's do this again real soon,

11:16.909 --> 11:19.178
say next Saturday, same time?

11:19.178 --> 11:20.479
But...
Gotta run!

11:20.479 --> 11:22.114
Ah, yeah, right.

11:22.114 --> 11:23.683
Ah, bye! Bye!
So long, uh.

11:23.683 --> 11:27.486
Gee, Cedric sure
did it all out there today!

11:27.486 --> 11:30.222
Yeah. Until this afternoon

11:30.222 --> 11:33.325
I always thought football
was a team sport.

11:33.325 --> 11:34.960
Well, I'm
starting to think,

11:34.960 --> 11:37.463
that Cedric could use
a little talking to.

11:37.463 --> 11:41.801
Huh, sure, if you can
get him to put his manual down.

11:43.135 --> 11:44.170
Let's see.

11:44.170 --> 11:46.672
I'll just punch
these numbers in and...

11:46.672 --> 11:48.007
We are sorry.

11:48.007 --> 11:51.510
We cannot disclose
the desired information.

11:51.510 --> 11:52.545
What?!

11:52.545 --> 11:55.047
Nobody withholds
information from me!

11:55.047 --> 11:57.049
Let me try this again.

11:57.049 --> 11:58.384
Sorry.

11:58.384 --> 12:02.388
This information is
strictly confidential.
Grrrrr!!!

12:02.388 --> 12:05.124
And this machine is
strictly for the birds!

12:05.124 --> 12:07.493
This time Cedric's gone too far!

12:08.094 --> 12:10.329
This is the last straw!

12:10.329 --> 12:12.898
Time to put an end to
this costly charade

12:12.898 --> 12:14.166
once and for all!

12:16.702 --> 12:19.672
Pig 1: Do you have
an appointment, Sir?

12:19.672 --> 12:21.407
One more oink
out of you Pig,

12:21.407 --> 12:23.275
and you're a budget cut!

12:23.275 --> 12:24.877
Cedric! What are you doing?!

12:24.877 --> 12:27.146
Have you gone completely
off your rocker?!

12:27.146 --> 12:29.181
Why? Is something wrong?

12:29.181 --> 12:31.417
You did tell me to
take the initiative.

12:31.417 --> 12:33.753
Yes, I did! I did?

12:33.753 --> 12:36.088
I-I-I guess I did.

12:36.088 --> 12:38.824
Er, take all the
initiative you like.

12:38.824 --> 12:40.926
You're doing an
excellent job, my boy!

12:40.926 --> 12:42.194
Excellent!

12:44.263 --> 12:46.165
I can't stand it anymore!

12:46.165 --> 12:48.334
I ask Cedric to
show a little drive

12:48.334 --> 12:49.835
and all of a sudden
he's more meddling

12:49.835 --> 12:51.504
than a government accountant!

12:51.504 --> 12:54.406
Too many Sneers
spoil the company!

12:54.406 --> 12:56.709
That boy has got to be stopped,

12:56.709 --> 12:59.445
and that book has
got to be destroyed!

13:02.448 --> 13:06.418
Pig 2: Ahem, your 3:00 o'clock
appointment is here, Sir.

13:06.418 --> 13:08.120
Sophia Tutu.

13:08.120 --> 13:10.422
Sophia? Send her in!

13:13.626 --> 13:14.960
Hi, Sophia!

13:14.960 --> 13:17.863
Cedric,
we have to talk.

13:17.863 --> 13:20.366
You've been home
for quite awhile now,

13:20.366 --> 13:23.302
and we've hardly seen you.

13:23.302 --> 13:25.905
Well I've been
very busy, Sophia.

13:25.905 --> 13:29.141
"Idle hands lead
to empty pockets,"

13:29.141 --> 13:30.709
so says my manual.

13:30.709 --> 13:33.512
We've all
missed the... old you.

13:33.512 --> 13:35.981
Gee, Sophia,
I don't understand.

13:35.981 --> 13:39.285
Everyone's asked me to
show more self confidence.

13:39.285 --> 13:41.654
Bert, Pop, Ralph,

13:41.654 --> 13:44.089
Melissa... even you!

13:44.089 --> 13:47.259
Well, um...
I suppose we have.

13:47.259 --> 13:50.729
And I have been showing
a lot more gumption since then,

13:50.729 --> 13:51.997
haven't I?

13:51.997 --> 13:53.833
Um, why,
yes, Cedric.

13:53.833 --> 13:55.100
You have been.

13:55.100 --> 13:57.269
So, if I'm
pleasing everybody

13:57.269 --> 13:59.071
where's the problem?

13:59.071 --> 14:03.309
Unless, I'm not living up to
everybody's expectations.

14:03.309 --> 14:06.679
Gee, I hope that's
not what it is, is it?

14:06.679 --> 14:07.813
No, Cedric.

14:07.813 --> 14:11.183
You're going beyond
everyone's expectations.

14:11.183 --> 14:12.952
Well, thank you, Sophia,

14:12.952 --> 14:14.620
but our time is up now.

14:14.620 --> 14:16.722
I have to brush up on my manual.

14:19.158 --> 14:20.860
...then he
asked me to leave,

14:20.860 --> 14:23.963
because he had to get
back to his manual!

14:23.963 --> 14:27.867
So, this is the "new
and improved" Cedric Sneer.

14:27.867 --> 14:30.002
I know
it's a "new" Cedric,

14:30.002 --> 14:32.471
but I'm beginning to
have my doubts about

14:32.471 --> 14:34.340
the "improved" part.

14:34.340 --> 14:36.842
He must be doing
all this for his Pop.

14:36.842 --> 14:39.645
I mean, who else
would he do it for?

14:39.645 --> 14:42.281
I think he's
doing it for all of us.

14:43.215 --> 14:46.852
Gee, I'd give anything
for the old Cedric

14:46.852 --> 14:49.889
to come knocking at
our door right now.

14:51.323 --> 14:52.825
Who could that be?

14:52.825 --> 14:55.561
Hey! Look! It's him!

14:55.561 --> 14:56.862
It's...

14:56.862 --> 14:57.897
Huh?!

14:57.897 --> 14:59.832
Cyril Sneer?!

14:59.832 --> 15:02.835
I think it's time
we had a little talk.

15:04.637 --> 15:06.405
Aaaah!

15:06.405 --> 15:09.508
Pop, you're looking
really on edge these days.

15:09.508 --> 15:10.910
To much pressure?

15:11.911 --> 15:13.679
More than you know, son.

15:13.679 --> 15:16.849
I'm even thinking a little
holiday might do me good.

15:16.849 --> 15:18.884
Say a camping trip.

15:18.884 --> 15:20.552
On Thunder Island.

15:20.552 --> 15:22.588
You wouldn't care to
come along, would you?

15:22.588 --> 15:24.690
Gosh, Pop,
I don't think so.

15:24.690 --> 15:26.692
There's so much work to do.

15:26.692 --> 15:30.162
C'mon, Cedric!
Do it for me.

15:30.162 --> 15:33.365
Lift your poor,
tired father's spirits.

15:33.365 --> 15:35.434
For you, Pop, anything!

15:35.434 --> 15:37.603
Let me check the manual.

15:37.603 --> 15:40.272
"When idle moments do arise,

15:40.272 --> 15:42.574
turn them into challenges."

15:42.574 --> 15:45.010
Great!
We leave immediately!

15:45.010 --> 15:47.746
Uh Pop, what's
the point of camping,

15:47.746 --> 15:49.748
when we can be using that time

15:49.748 --> 15:51.417
to build character?

15:51.417 --> 15:54.253
Let's make it a
survival weekend!

15:54.253 --> 15:55.421
A what?!

15:55.421 --> 15:58.424
We'll fend for
ourselves in the great outdoors!

15:58.424 --> 16:00.526
Hmm, well,

16:00.526 --> 16:01.593
that's not exactly

16:01.593 --> 16:03.195
what we had in mind.

16:03.195 --> 16:05.297
"We"?
Uh.."oui".

16:05.297 --> 16:07.366
I'm practicing my French.

16:12.838 --> 16:14.974
Make it fast with
those costumes, gang!

16:14.974 --> 16:16.608
I can see them now.

16:16.942 --> 16:19.445
There you go,
all strapped in.

16:19.445 --> 16:22.614
Now remember, get that manual!

16:22.614 --> 16:24.616
Pig 1: Get the manual?

16:24.616 --> 16:26.885
How dumb do you
think we are?

16:26.885 --> 16:30.089
What else would we be
after, dressed like this?

16:31.223 --> 16:32.257
Pig 3: Worms?

16:34.126 --> 16:35.294
Yeow ooo!!!

16:39.565 --> 16:40.933
Keep paddling, Pop.

16:40.933 --> 16:42.968
Just a few miles more!

16:42.968 --> 16:45.704
"Healthy body, healthy mind,

16:45.704 --> 16:47.473
healthy profits".

16:47.473 --> 16:49.341
It says so in my manual.

16:50.476 --> 16:55.414
But this... is supposed to be...
a vacation,

16:55.414 --> 16:57.983
not a... heart test!

16:57.983 --> 17:00.953
Oh. Well, anytime
you want to turn back, Pop...

17:00.953 --> 17:04.089
there are some things I
could be doing at the office.

17:04.089 --> 17:06.025
Er..no, no, no, son.

17:06.025 --> 17:08.293
I'm having a great time.

17:08.293 --> 17:09.828
Ouch!

17:09.828 --> 17:12.197
Say, why don't we stop here

17:12.197 --> 17:13.665
and do a little fishing, Cedric?

17:13.665 --> 17:15.601
This looks like a good spot.

17:15.601 --> 17:16.702
Sure, Pop.

17:16.702 --> 17:18.971
You'll have to start
without me, though.

17:20.539 --> 17:23.942
"Always strive to be as
forceful as you can."

17:23.942 --> 17:26.645
Cedric! Look at
the size of these babies.

17:26.645 --> 17:28.814
Never pass on a big opportunity.

17:28.814 --> 17:30.783
Didn't they teach you
that at that school?

17:30.783 --> 17:33.318
Take charge!
Aye aye, Sir!

17:33.852 --> 17:35.554
They're huge, son.

17:35.554 --> 17:38.791
Better have both of
your hands on that pole!

17:38.791 --> 17:39.992
You're right, Pop!

17:39.992 --> 17:41.994
That's the idea!

17:41.994 --> 17:44.129
Pig 2:

17:44.129 --> 17:45.230
Where's the book?

17:45.230 --> 17:47.399
Over there,
you pig-paddling dope!

17:47.399 --> 17:50.002
What do I look like
to you, a librarian?

17:57.843 --> 18:00.913
"Always strive to be
as forceful as you can."

18:00.913 --> 18:03.115
Okay, here goes!

18:03.115 --> 18:06.485
Ugghh!!

18:06.485 --> 18:07.986
Pig 2: Aaahhh!!!!

18:09.555 --> 18:11.390
What was that?

18:11.390 --> 18:13.392
Must've
been a rainbow snout.

18:13.392 --> 18:14.860
Er, trout!

18:14.860 --> 18:16.762
They're tricky little devils.

18:17.896 --> 18:19.898
Just not tricky enough.

18:26.438 --> 18:29.408
There's nothing like an
improvised meal, huh Pop?

18:29.408 --> 18:31.877
Roots, nuts, tree bark...

18:31.877 --> 18:33.712
It builds character!

18:33.712 --> 18:36.281
Tree bark doesn't
build character,

18:36.281 --> 18:37.749
it builds boats!

18:37.749 --> 18:41.353
Oh oh! Looks
like bad weather coming in.

18:41.353 --> 18:42.888
We'd better be prepared, Pop.

18:44.123 --> 18:45.624
How do I look, gang?

18:45.624 --> 18:47.593
Like a real skunk, Bert!

18:47.593 --> 18:49.428
The second you even go near him,

18:49.428 --> 18:51.563
Cedric should
run away in terror!

18:52.631 --> 18:54.299
And drop that book!

18:54.299 --> 18:58.537
This is a
dis-stinktly clever plan!

19:02.975 --> 19:04.877
We'd better hurry
and finish this shelter.

19:04.877 --> 19:06.445
Like the book says,

19:06.445 --> 19:08.447
"any old port in a storm"

19:08.447 --> 19:11.450
and that storm's
getting awfully close.

19:11.450 --> 19:13.719
And so is that skunk!

19:13.719 --> 19:14.920
A skunk?

19:17.356 --> 19:18.590
Yiiiikes!!

19:26.231 --> 19:29.001
Bert!!!
What's going on here?

19:31.970 --> 19:34.840
My manual! Ahhh!

19:34.840 --> 19:38.944
♪ (dramatic music) ♪

19:38.944 --> 19:40.779
Ralph! Melissa! Schaeffer!

19:40.779 --> 19:43.148
Sophia! What are you doing here?

19:45.617 --> 19:47.319
Ahhh!

19:48.187 --> 19:49.955
Cedric! Help!!

19:49.955 --> 19:52.658
Somebody! Anybody! Hellpp!!

19:54.026 --> 19:56.361
My manual!
Help!

19:56.361 --> 19:58.797
Pop! I'm coming! I'm coming!

20:01.967 --> 20:03.035
Aaaah! Uh!

20:03.302 --> 20:05.170
Pop, are you alright?

20:05.170 --> 20:07.973
Oh! My leg! My leg!

20:07.973 --> 20:09.675
I think, I've broken it!

20:09.675 --> 20:12.544
Um, okay...
nobody move him!

20:12.544 --> 20:15.714
Bert, make a couple tree
branches into splints.

20:15.714 --> 20:17.649
Gotcha!
Sophia,
Melissa,

20:17.649 --> 20:20.485
get a cloth from my knapsack
and tear it into strips.

20:20.485 --> 20:21.720
Right!
Okay, Cedric.

20:21.720 --> 20:24.323
Ralph, cover Pop
with my sleeping bag.

20:24.323 --> 20:25.324
Right!

20:25.824 --> 20:27.893
Everything's
gonna be alright, Pop.

20:28.360 --> 20:30.395
(laughs) It sure is.

20:30.395 --> 20:34.766
The old Cedric's got
everything under control.

20:38.537 --> 20:40.872
Looks like the fire is
getting a little low, Cedric.

20:42.407 --> 20:44.643
It could us
a little more fuel.

20:44.643 --> 20:46.044
Huh?

20:48.480 --> 20:50.148
There!

20:50.148 --> 20:52.084
That should do it
for a little while.

20:55.053 --> 20:56.922
Er.. Cedric,

20:56.922 --> 20:59.324
about trying to change you.

20:59.324 --> 21:03.395
Eh-eh, your father and I have
something to say about that.

21:04.029 --> 21:05.697
Right, Mr. Sneer?

21:05.697 --> 21:07.633
Er, right.

21:08.500 --> 21:09.835
Go ahead.

21:09.835 --> 21:12.537
Okay, on
the count of three.

21:12.537 --> 21:14.573
Bert/Cyril: One. Two.

21:14.573 --> 21:16.208
Three...

21:16.208 --> 21:17.709
Sorry.

21:18.210 --> 21:20.045
Hey, that's alright.

21:20.045 --> 21:21.413
You meant well.

21:21.413 --> 21:24.249
We liked you
just the way you were.

21:24.249 --> 21:25.917
In that case,

21:25.917 --> 21:28.420
let's get on to what I do best.

21:29.121 --> 21:31.023
Uh... are you
sure you want to cook

21:31.023 --> 21:33.425
all those at the
same time, Cedric?

21:33.425 --> 21:35.460
I think
I know what I'm doing...

21:35.460 --> 21:37.929
Too many cooks spoil the broth.

21:37.929 --> 21:39.064
Huh? Oh.

21:39.064 --> 21:40.799
ya, right.

21:40.799 --> 21:43.402
around here
you're the boss, Cedric.
