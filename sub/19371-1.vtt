02:11.072 --> 02:13.165
This is a diary...

02:13.241 --> 02:14.674
of...

02:15.977 --> 02:17.968
hate.

02:22.517 --> 02:25.281
And perhaps I wouldn't
be writing it...

02:25.353 --> 02:29.449
if some devil hadn't made me
stop him that night...

02:29.524 --> 02:32.049
in the rain.

02:32.126 --> 02:34.219
You want to drown, Henry?

02:37.598 --> 02:39.793
I wanted a bit of air.

02:40.868 --> 02:42.802
How nice to see you, Bendrix.

02:42.870 --> 02:45.304
How long has it been?
A year?

02:46.407 --> 02:48.466
June, 1944.

02:48.543 --> 02:51.205
As long as that?

02:51.279 --> 02:53.679
How's Sarah?

02:53.748 --> 02:56.148
Oh, she's out and about
somewhere.

02:56.217 --> 02:58.151
She at the cinema?

02:59.353 --> 03:01.480
No, she never goes.

03:03.458 --> 03:05.153
Oh, good night, Henry.

03:06.260 --> 03:08.990
You should go home
before you catch your death.

03:12.467 --> 03:14.401
Is something wrong?

03:18.706 --> 03:20.640
Let me take you home, Henry.

03:23.211 --> 03:26.271
Or perhaps I wouldn't
be writing this...

03:26.347 --> 03:29.316
if I had known then
who I hated.

03:29.383 --> 03:32.477
Was it Henry?
Was it his wife Sarah?

03:33.855 --> 03:37.848
Or was it some other
who was yet to be revealed to me?

03:40.728 --> 03:42.628
Sarah?

03:48.436 --> 03:50.529
See? She's out still.

03:58.613 --> 04:00.046
Come upstairs.

04:23.738 --> 04:26.138
Come in.
Let me get you a drink.

04:26.207 --> 04:28.801
Whiskey, thank you.

04:28.876 --> 04:30.309
Whiskey.

04:39.620 --> 04:42.180
So what's troubling you,
Henry?

04:43.791 --> 04:46.157
Sarah.

04:57.305 --> 04:59.933
She's out for a walk now,
Bendrix.

05:04.445 --> 05:06.436
A walk.

05:06.514 --> 05:09.278
Well, she always was
a great walker.

05:24.131 --> 05:26.292
Jealousy's a terrible thing.

05:27.735 --> 05:29.965
Well, you know you
can trust me, Henry.

05:32.573 --> 05:35.906
You know, I went so far...

05:35.977 --> 05:38.912
as to get the name
of a private detective.

05:40.615 --> 05:44.483
You think she's seeing someone?

05:44.552 --> 05:46.679
- Of course you think me a fool.
- No, Henry.

05:47.955 --> 05:50.150
I don't think you're a fool.

05:51.359 --> 05:53.827
- You mean you think it's possible?
- Of course.

05:53.895 --> 05:56.022
Sarah's human.

05:59.200 --> 06:00.633
Can't sleep.

06:03.404 --> 06:05.429
Keep picking up...

06:05.506 --> 06:09.237
this wretched card.

06:11.679 --> 06:12.771
Burn it.

06:12.847 --> 06:16.146
- I wish I could.
- Then go see what's-his-name, Savage?

06:16.217 --> 06:19.015
And sit where all
the jealous husbands sit?

06:20.922 --> 06:23.254
Do you think they have
a waiting room, Bendrix...

06:23.324 --> 06:26.020
where we see each other's faces
as we pass through?

06:26.093 --> 06:27.993
Why not let me go, Henry?

06:29.697 --> 06:31.221
- You?
- Yes.

06:31.299 --> 06:34.564
I could pretend
to be a jealous lover.

06:34.635 --> 06:37.968
Jealous lovers are less ridiculous
than jealous husbands.

06:38.039 --> 06:40.530
They're supported
by the weight of literature.

06:40.608 --> 06:43.873
Tragic, never comic.
Think of Troilus.

06:43.945 --> 06:48.348
Well, I shan't lose my amour propre
when I interview Mr. Savage.

06:49.717 --> 06:50.809
This is ridiculous.

06:50.885 --> 06:52.819
One can't spy on one's wife
through a friend...

06:52.887 --> 06:54.821
and have the friend
pretend to be her lover.

06:54.889 --> 06:58.222
- What else are friends for?
- You're a good chap, Bendrix.

06:58.292 --> 07:00.453
All I needed was to talk,
clear my head.

07:00.528 --> 07:03.588
The name was Savage,
and the address was 3 Vigo Passage.

07:03.664 --> 07:06.599
Forget what I've told you.
Doesn't make sense. I'll see a doctor.

07:09.303 --> 07:11.237
That was the door.
Sarah's come in.

07:12.406 --> 07:15.273
It's the maid.
She's been to the pictures.

07:15.343 --> 07:17.573
No, it was Sarah's step.

07:21.082 --> 07:23.243
Sarah, darling.

07:23.317 --> 07:25.683
Henry.

07:27.154 --> 07:29.452
- You... Is that you?
- Been out for a walk?

07:29.523 --> 07:32.083
- Yes.
- It's a filthy night.

07:32.159 --> 07:35.424
You're wet through, Sarah.
One day you'll catch your death of cold.

07:37.465 --> 07:38.898
Good night.

07:43.938 --> 07:46.532
Their marriage was conventional...

07:46.607 --> 07:48.802
like their well-appointed house.

07:48.876 --> 07:52.039
And I liked them both
the first night we met...

07:52.113 --> 07:56.209
drinking bad South African sherry
because of the war in Spain.

07:57.451 --> 07:58.941
Good evening, sir.

07:59.020 --> 08:00.954
- May I take your hat?
- Thank you.

08:01.022 --> 08:02.956
Mr. Miles is upstairs.

08:10.331 --> 08:11.628
Sherry, sir?

08:11.699 --> 08:13.223
Thank you.

08:13.300 --> 08:15.234
She seemed restless.

08:16.737 --> 08:19.365
In the summer of 1939...

08:19.440 --> 08:23.308
the whole of London was restless
in the face of the coming storm.

08:36.390 --> 08:38.482
How nice of you to come.

08:40.494 --> 08:43.657
Sarah, this is our neighbor,
the novelist chap.

08:43.731 --> 08:45.756
What on earth
is a novelist doing here?

08:45.833 --> 08:46.993
- Research.
- On what?

08:47.068 --> 08:48.433
On your husband.

08:48.502 --> 08:52.165
I'm trying to write a character
who works for the Ministry of Pensions.

08:52.239 --> 08:54.969
I need to find out his habits,
what he drinks before bedtime.

08:55.042 --> 08:56.634
- Cocoa.
- And when.

08:56.710 --> 08:58.974
11:00, isn't it, Sarah?
Unless we're entertaining.

09:00.181 --> 09:02.911
Would you be so kind
as to excuse your character?

09:02.983 --> 09:05.508
- The ministry needs him.
- Unfortunately it does.

09:07.421 --> 09:08.979
- So tell me.
- What?

09:09.056 --> 09:11.422
- His secrets.
- Henry's a good man.

09:11.492 --> 09:13.858
- Good men have no secrets.
- I was afraid you'd say that.

09:13.928 --> 09:16.863
You see, goodness
has so little fictional value.

09:16.931 --> 09:18.626
What does have fictional value?

09:18.699 --> 09:22.191
- A minister of Home Security.
- Are you saying my husband is fiction?

09:22.269 --> 09:25.067
I'm saying he could be,
in the right hands.

09:25.139 --> 09:27.505
Oh, dear. This is alarming.
Can we get away from the service?

09:27.575 --> 09:31.341
- You mean change the subject?
- I meant fresh air actually.

09:31.412 --> 09:32.504
Of course.

09:34.381 --> 09:37.407
- So how long have you been married?
- Is your character married?

09:37.485 --> 09:40.215
Yes, he's been married happily
for ten years.

09:40.287 --> 09:43.222
Henry's the perfect model then.
We've been married ten years.

09:43.290 --> 09:44.416
You know that...

09:44.492 --> 09:47.359
happiness is even harder to write
than goodness.

09:47.428 --> 09:50.488
Henry prefers habit to happiness.

09:53.367 --> 09:57.360
- I'll give them to you to sign.
- We were discussing the house, darling.

09:58.639 --> 10:01.164
Let me fill that for you.

10:01.242 --> 10:03.676
- It's a lovely house.
- My wife found it.

10:03.744 --> 10:05.678
And your wife is charming.

10:05.746 --> 10:08.078
- She's a great help to me.
- Yes, I'm sure.

10:08.149 --> 10:10.743
They've made a picture
of one of your books, haven't they?

10:10.818 --> 10:13.981
Yes, it's playing at the Rialto.

10:14.054 --> 10:17.251
- I'll take you both.
- Far too busy for pictures, I'm afraid.

10:17.324 --> 10:18.916
Should I make a note of that?

10:18.993 --> 10:21.154
Make sure your character
never gets home before 10:00.

10:21.228 --> 10:23.958
- Come out, Henry, for once?
- You know I can't, darling.

10:24.031 --> 10:26.829
But you go.
Take her, Bendrix.

10:26.901 --> 10:29.631
- Sarah, one has to insist.
- Henry.

10:29.703 --> 10:32.501
- Where are you going?
- To see wonder.

10:32.573 --> 10:35.838
- But you promised.
- Murderer's promises keep.

10:40.381 --> 10:43.942
- It's not what I wrote, you know.
- You can't keep saying that.

10:44.018 --> 10:46.612
- It's true.
- I know.

10:57.198 --> 10:59.598
There was one scene you did write.

10:59.667 --> 11:01.157
Describe it.

11:01.235 --> 11:03.726
Where he offered her onions
with her meal.

11:03.804 --> 11:06.796
She refused because her husband
didn't like the smell.

11:06.874 --> 11:08.637
He got angry.

11:10.211 --> 11:12.179
And why did he get angry?

11:15.115 --> 11:18.312
He didn't want to think of her
going home to him.

11:25.726 --> 11:27.284
Does Henry like onions?

11:28.295 --> 11:29.728
No.

11:54.588 --> 11:57.022
I'm in love, you know.

11:58.759 --> 12:00.192
Me too.

12:07.434 --> 12:08.867
Susan?

13:10.431 --> 13:11.921
Come upstairs.

14:58.739 --> 15:00.172
Sarah?

15:07.881 --> 15:09.815
One minute, dear.

15:12.352 --> 15:15.048
What if he heard?

15:15.122 --> 15:17.352
He wouldn't recognize the sound.

15:32.339 --> 15:34.705
- Sarah, you been eating onions?
- Sorry, darling.

15:36.076 --> 15:38.010
So, Bendrix,
how was the picture?

15:38.078 --> 15:40.012
Up to scratch?

15:42.883 --> 15:46.046
Of course, as she began to love me...

15:46.119 --> 15:48.986
she learned to deceive Henry.

15:49.056 --> 15:53.254
So why was I upset to find
that two years later...

15:53.327 --> 15:56.091
she was deceiving him again?

16:06.573 --> 16:10.475
Mr. Bendrix, I assume we
are discussing Mrs. Bendrix.

16:10.544 --> 16:14.275
Not exactly. She's the wife
of a friend of mine.

16:14.348 --> 16:17.283
Perhaps you and the lady
are intimate?

16:17.351 --> 16:18.784
No.

16:18.852 --> 16:22.083
I've only seen her once
since 1944.

16:22.155 --> 16:24.180
I don't understand.

16:24.258 --> 16:26.453
You said this was a watching case.

16:30.330 --> 16:33.561
Can't one love or hate
as long as that?

16:34.468 --> 16:37.437
There's nothing discreditable
about jealousy, Mr. Bendrix.

16:38.438 --> 16:41.032
I always salute it
as the mark of true love.

16:41.108 --> 16:44.839
I've come on behalf of the husband.
He thinks she's deceiving him.

16:44.912 --> 16:48.609
- She has secrets.
- Ah, secrets.

16:48.682 --> 16:51.981
- Yes.
- There may be nothing in it, of course.

16:52.052 --> 16:54.543
In my experience, Mr. Bendrix...

16:54.621 --> 16:56.919
there almost invariably is.

16:58.258 --> 17:00.192
Shall my man report to you
or the husband?

17:00.260 --> 17:01.352
To me.

17:01.428 --> 17:03.658
He must know nothing about it.

17:06.400 --> 17:08.334
Most interesting case.

17:09.469 --> 17:13.496
All my men use great discretion.
I will put one on it immediately.

17:13.574 --> 17:17.704
And he will do his damndest
to put your mind at rest.

17:19.680 --> 17:21.614
Or should I say the husband's?

17:41.969 --> 17:43.869
Hello?

17:45.939 --> 17:48.703
Good.
Yes, it was good to see you.

17:50.177 --> 17:52.645
Yes, how long has it been?
Two years.

17:52.713 --> 17:54.647
As long as that?

17:54.715 --> 17:57.377
Well, you were always better
at anniversaries than me.

17:58.719 --> 18:01.552
You want to meet?
Well, whatever for?

18:03.323 --> 18:06.383
Not tomorrow, no.
I've got this article.

18:07.961 --> 18:10.225
Wednesday? Let me check.

18:15.502 --> 18:17.436
Would Thursday do?

18:18.705 --> 18:21.230
Good.
The Park Lane Hotel at 1:00?

18:36.757 --> 18:39.988
It was odd to think
that during the war...

18:40.060 --> 18:43.029
we could be so totally at peace.

18:43.096 --> 18:45.792
There were nights
when I wished those sirens...

18:45.866 --> 18:47.800
would never end.

19:16.430 --> 19:18.830
Tell me again.

19:18.899 --> 19:20.924
I love you.

19:23.837 --> 19:25.930
And I always will.

19:42.989 --> 19:46.584
I'm sorry I'm late.
I came by tube, but it was crowded.

19:46.660 --> 19:48.594
Well, taxi is quicker.

19:48.662 --> 19:51.153
I know.
Didn't want to be quick.

19:53.433 --> 19:55.367
I booked a table at Palmer's.

20:00.340 --> 20:02.672
Can't we stay here?

20:02.743 --> 20:05.974
Well, it's where
we always used to go.

20:06.046 --> 20:08.344
You see,
I've never been back there.

20:09.416 --> 20:11.509
Well, it was never
your restaurant, was it?

20:11.585 --> 20:14.520
- So you still go there?
- Yeah, two or three times a week.

20:14.588 --> 20:16.522
It's convenient.

20:17.824 --> 20:19.257
Let's go.

20:24.097 --> 20:26.031
Thank you. Thanks.

20:27.601 --> 20:29.535
- Sorry about that.
- That's quite all right, sir.

20:29.603 --> 20:31.400
Got my hand caught in the way.

20:51.658 --> 20:54.183
Such a pleasure to see you, sir.

20:54.261 --> 20:56.923
It's been so long,
I thought you'd forgotten us.

20:56.997 --> 20:59.830
- I was afraid you'd say that.
- And you, ma'am.

20:59.900 --> 21:03.063
- It's been a long time too.
- Two years, Alfred.

21:07.541 --> 21:10.374
- There.
- Thank you.

21:22.155 --> 21:24.123
Why did you lie?

21:24.191 --> 21:27.058
- About my coming here?
- Yes.

21:27.127 --> 21:29.595
Why did you want to meet?

21:31.832 --> 21:34.733
I wanted to ask you about Henry.

21:34.801 --> 21:36.234
Henry.

21:37.771 --> 21:39.898
I'm worried about him.

21:39.973 --> 21:42.271
How did you find him
the other night?

21:42.342 --> 21:45.277
- Was he strange at all?
- I didn't notice anything wrong.

21:46.780 --> 21:50.546
I wanted to ask you...
I know you're very busy...

21:50.617 --> 21:52.915
whether you could
look him up occasionally.

21:52.986 --> 21:55.045
I think he's lonely.

21:55.121 --> 21:57.112
With you?

21:57.190 --> 21:59.420
You know he's
never really noticed me...

21:59.492 --> 22:01.426
not for years.

22:02.796 --> 22:05.458
Maybe you've given him reason.

22:06.666 --> 22:08.793
What reason could I give?

22:12.472 --> 22:15.134
What reason did you give me?

22:19.079 --> 22:20.512
None.

22:23.817 --> 22:25.785
- Are you on a new book?
- Of course.

22:25.852 --> 22:28.787
It's not about us, is it?
The one you threatened to write.

22:28.855 --> 22:32.655
A book takes a year to write.
It's too hard work for revenge.

22:32.726 --> 22:34.990
If you knew how little
you had to revenge.

22:35.061 --> 22:38.724
I'm joking.
Yeah, we had a good time together.

22:38.798 --> 22:42.063
We're adults, and we knew
it had to end sometime.

22:42.135 --> 22:45.662
And now we can lunch
and talk about Henry.

22:55.448 --> 22:56.540
I'm sorry.

22:56.616 --> 23:00.177
This was stupid,
and I really shouldn't have called.

23:00.253 --> 23:02.483
That cough needs attending to.

23:02.555 --> 23:05.115
It's only a cough.

23:05.191 --> 23:06.818
Good-bye, Maurice.

23:06.893 --> 23:08.326
Good-bye.

23:15.335 --> 23:16.859
- Your menu, sir.
- Thank you.

23:22.175 --> 23:26.009
I'm sorry, but you have to realize
I'm jealous of everything that moves.

23:26.079 --> 23:29.708
- I'm jealous of the rain.
- How can you be jealous of the rain?

23:48.335 --> 23:50.803
Where did you get it?

23:50.870 --> 23:52.497
Spain.

23:52.572 --> 23:55.006
That was my war, I'm afraid.

23:55.075 --> 23:57.168
It finished me off for this one.

23:57.243 --> 24:00.212
You were shot. How romantic.

24:00.280 --> 24:03.875
Not really.
They put a pin inside me.

24:03.950 --> 24:07.647
I wondered about the limp.
Could I grow to love it?

24:07.721 --> 24:09.882
And have you?

24:09.956 --> 24:13.756
I have never, ever loved anyone
as much as you.

24:34.981 --> 24:36.539
Yes?

24:37.684 --> 24:40.448
A Mr. Parkis to see you, sir.

24:40.520 --> 24:42.283
Show him in.

24:42.355 --> 24:44.289
This way, please.

24:48.795 --> 24:52.128
- I'll be with you in a minute, Mr...
- The name's Parkis.

24:53.266 --> 24:55.928
Mr. Savage's man.

24:56.002 --> 24:58.994
Sit down.
Take a cigarette.

24:59.072 --> 25:01.267
Oh, no, sir.
Not on duty, sir.

25:01.341 --> 25:03.400
Unless, of course,
for purposes of concealment.

25:03.476 --> 25:05.410
But you're not on duty now.

25:05.478 --> 25:07.810
Well, in a manner of speaking,
yes, sir.

25:07.881 --> 25:11.146
I've just been relieved for half an hour
while I make my report.

25:12.652 --> 25:15.644
So there's something to report?

25:15.722 --> 25:17.747
It's not quite a blank sheet, sir.

25:20.693 --> 25:22.627
Have me met
somewhere before, sir?

25:24.364 --> 25:26.355
I don't think so.

25:30.703 --> 25:33.900
Well, like I say, sir...

25:33.973 --> 25:36.134
it's not quite a blank sheet.

25:36.209 --> 25:38.143
But then it never is.

25:40.747 --> 25:43.580
Me and my boy,
we followed the...

25:43.650 --> 25:45.641
Your boy?

25:45.718 --> 25:48.380
My son, sir.

25:48.455 --> 25:51.822
Yeah, I'm teaching him
the business.

25:51.891 --> 25:55.019
I mean, a boy can be useful
in all sorts of ways.

25:56.129 --> 25:59.997
On the day in question, the party in
question went by tube to Piccadilly...

26:01.267 --> 26:03.633
and proceeded
to the Park Lane Hotel.

26:03.703 --> 26:06.194
She seemed quite agitated.

26:07.607 --> 26:10.405
And there met a gentleman with whom
she was obviously quite close...

26:10.477 --> 26:14.675
since they greeted each other
with an affectionate lack of ceremony...

26:14.747 --> 26:16.339
and at one point...

26:16.416 --> 26:19.977
although I cannot be certain of this...
held hands along the bar.

26:21.287 --> 26:24.120
- They held hands?
- Yes, sir.

26:24.190 --> 26:26.590
Gentleman pushed the lady's glass
towards her...

26:26.659 --> 26:27.751
and...

26:27.827 --> 26:30.421
the hand sort of stayed there...

26:30.497 --> 26:32.089
for some time.

26:32.165 --> 26:34.395
Which generally indicates
a squeeze of that nature.

26:36.803 --> 26:39.897
After a short conversation,
they proceeded to a restaurant...

26:39.973 --> 26:41.565
called...

26:41.641 --> 26:43.165
Palmer's...

26:43.243 --> 26:46.371
which was difficult to gain access to,
me being with the boy and all.

26:46.446 --> 26:48.380
But I observed them
through the window.

26:49.349 --> 26:52.409
And after a while,
the lady left...

26:52.485 --> 26:55.045
laboring...
well, it seemed to me...

26:55.121 --> 26:57.248
under great emotion.

26:57.323 --> 27:00.224
Great emotion.
You're sure of that?

27:00.293 --> 27:02.227
Oh, without doubt, sir.

27:02.295 --> 27:05.389
Then I followed her down
Charing Cross Road to Maiden Lane...

27:05.465 --> 27:09.765
where she turned into a church for what
I can only presume was a good cry.

27:11.638 --> 27:13.606
She's not a Roman, is she, sir?

27:13.673 --> 27:15.106
No.

27:15.175 --> 27:16.699
Thought not.

27:16.776 --> 27:19.540
She didn't kneel, sir,
but sat.

27:19.612 --> 27:22.172
From the angle of her face,
I could tell...

27:22.248 --> 27:24.682
tears were an issue.

27:24.751 --> 27:27.686
- Forgive the personal touch.
- Of course.

27:29.489 --> 27:33.084
You see, I liked the lady.
The party in question.

27:33.159 --> 27:36.253
As did I, but you were wrong
about the hands.

27:36.329 --> 27:38.627
The hands, sir?

27:38.698 --> 27:41.462
We never so much as touched hands.

27:43.570 --> 27:44.662
Oh, dear.

27:44.737 --> 27:48.366
- I have made a fool of myself.
- Sarah has that effect.

27:48.441 --> 27:51.706
Mr. Savage
should have introduced us.

27:51.778 --> 27:54.042
Oh, no, sir.

27:54.113 --> 27:57.105
- It was up to me.
- Well, it's not serious.

27:57.183 --> 28:00.710
If you look at it from the outside,
it's quite funny.

28:00.787 --> 28:02.982
But I'm on the inside, sir.

28:04.224 --> 28:07.751
It's not Mr. Savage I'm worried about
so much. It's my boy, sir.

28:09.229 --> 28:13.188
- When I tell him you're the husband...
- But you're wrong.

28:13.266 --> 28:15.598
I'm acting on the husband's behalf.

28:15.668 --> 28:18.501
So you've requested
an investigation yourself?

28:18.571 --> 28:21.005
That's an interesting paradox.

28:21.074 --> 28:23.167
But who's the wronged party then,
sir, if you'll forgive?

28:27.113 --> 28:28.205
Pardon me, sir.

28:29.816 --> 28:32.307
I am slow in such matters.

28:32.385 --> 28:35.877
Both you and the husband have been
supplanted in the lady's affections by...

28:35.955 --> 28:37.388
Another?

28:39.492 --> 28:42.188
Try to think of it
the way I do, Mr. Parkis.

28:44.197 --> 28:47.132
Jealousy can only exist
with desire.

28:48.201 --> 28:51.398
You are on a hunt for desire.

28:51.471 --> 28:54.031
Just regard yourself
as its servant.

28:55.375 --> 28:58.037
Of course, sir.
That's my job.

28:58.878 --> 29:00.311
Thank you.

29:11.624 --> 29:14.058
The vicarious lover, Parkis.

29:15.295 --> 29:17.627
- Good night, sir.
- Good night.

29:25.371 --> 29:28.272
I wondered how much of her
he could reclaim for me.

29:29.575 --> 29:32.442
And, for a moment,
I wished I was him...

29:32.512 --> 29:35.538
shining his searchlight
around her world.

29:42.221 --> 29:45.019
I am a jealous man.

29:58.504 --> 30:01.735
- I'm jealous of this stocking.
- Why?

30:01.808 --> 30:04.003
'Cause it does what I can't.

30:05.111 --> 30:07.045
It kisses your whole leg.

30:10.049 --> 30:13.610
And I'm jealous of this button.

30:13.686 --> 30:17.144
- Poor, innocent button.
- It's not innocent at all.

30:18.524 --> 30:21.925
It's with you all day,
and I'm not.

30:27.767 --> 30:30.600
- I suppose you're jealous of my shoes.
- Yes.

30:31.671 --> 30:33.263
Why?

30:34.741 --> 30:36.766
Because they'll
take you away from me.

30:38.878 --> 30:42.177
I measured love
by the extent of my jealousy.

30:42.248 --> 30:44.011
And as my jealousy was infinite...

30:44.083 --> 30:46.017
Anyone who loves is jealous.

30:46.085 --> 30:48.315
My love should have
been infinite too.

30:48.388 --> 30:52.620
I hate you being unhappy. I don't mind
anything you do that makes you happy.

30:52.692 --> 30:54.990
- If I slept with someone else?
- That's neither here nor there.

30:55.061 --> 30:56.995
I want you to be happy,
that's all.

30:57.063 --> 30:58.997
Maybe you'd want an excuse
to do the same.

30:59.065 --> 31:01.226
- I never would.
- But you do.

31:01.300 --> 31:04.292
- Do what?
- Sleep with someone else.

31:04.370 --> 31:07.339
You mean Henry?
How can anyone be jealous of Henry?

31:07.407 --> 31:10.103
He has you. I don't.

31:10.176 --> 31:12.110
We inhabit the same house.

31:12.178 --> 31:15.978
That's all. You know that.
I'm the shadow he walks around.

31:16.048 --> 31:17.845
And I love you.

31:17.917 --> 31:20.852
I would rather be dead or see you dead
than with another man.

31:20.920 --> 31:24.117
I will never, ever be
with another man.

31:24.190 --> 31:28.217
You may see me dead,
but I will never be with another man.

31:28.294 --> 31:30.694
- We should go down to the shelter.
- Stay here, Sarah.

31:30.763 --> 31:32.697
If a bomb hit us now,
think of what wouldn't happen.

31:32.765 --> 31:35.996
- What wouldn't happen?
- You wouldn't go back to Henry.

31:36.068 --> 31:38.002
I would never imagine
another lover.

31:38.070 --> 31:41.369
- My jealousy would end.
- Would that make you happy?

33:13.299 --> 33:15.233
Do you believe me now?

33:22.174 --> 33:25.200
But sadly, I didn't believe her.

33:25.278 --> 33:27.974
There was a devil in my mind
that would never let me.

33:29.048 --> 33:32.484
And now I had Parkis' boy
playing the devil's game.

35:13.452 --> 35:14.544
My boy managed to gain access, sir.

35:15.921 --> 35:19.482
Remarkably useful he can be.
I call that Exhibit "A."

35:19.558 --> 35:24.461
They say a promise is forever,
but I don't know if I can keep this one.

35:24.530 --> 35:27.795
He killed me with jealousy.
You're killing me with love.

35:27.867 --> 35:31.132
So he's got the scent too,
Parkis.

35:31.203 --> 35:33.569
- What scent?
- The scent of love.

35:33.639 --> 35:36.665
Stalking it like a retriever.

35:36.742 --> 35:39.836
Well, he's
remarkably persistent, sir.

35:39.912 --> 35:43.746
He observed the party in question,
then in a state of partial undress...

35:43.816 --> 35:46.216
with an unidentified male.

35:46.285 --> 35:48.753
- Where?
- In the bedroom, sir.

35:48.821 --> 35:51.813
The male party then closed the door,
and my boy made his exit.

35:51.891 --> 35:55.122
The implications, and I think
you would agree, is that...

35:55.194 --> 35:57.492
intimacy was...

35:58.431 --> 35:59.989
imminent.

36:00.066 --> 36:02.227
Indeed. Who is he?

36:02.301 --> 36:04.633
Here, sir, is where progress
was definitely made.

36:05.438 --> 36:08.737
As my boy left, he glanced at the
appointment book in the front hallway.

36:08.808 --> 36:13.245
The party in question had a dental
appointment at 3::30 the following day.

36:13.312 --> 36:15.780
In fact, she visited at 3::30...

36:15.848 --> 36:20.012
a premises on 65 Cedar Road
where no dentist sign was in evidence.

36:39.638 --> 36:41.799
A Mr. Smythe owns the premises, sir.

36:41.874 --> 36:44.707
Smythe, with a "Y"?

36:44.777 --> 36:47.940
Yes, sir. S-M-Y-T-H-E.

36:49.048 --> 36:51.312
And...

36:51.383 --> 36:52.816
no...

36:54.587 --> 36:58.455
Though we have no evidence
of intimacy...

36:58.524 --> 37:00.583
the implication is clearly there.

37:00.659 --> 37:02.593
How is it there?

37:02.661 --> 37:04.720
Why the fictitious
dental appointment, sir?

37:07.666 --> 37:09.293
Exhibit "B."

37:09.368 --> 37:11.302
My boy took that.

37:13.405 --> 37:16.340
The party in question emerged
two hours later.

37:16.408 --> 37:19.673
Passage of time being
amply sufficient for...

37:19.745 --> 37:21.406
intimacy to have taken place.

37:22.481 --> 37:24.972
The courts generally demand
at least an hour, sir.

37:26.118 --> 37:29.747
Now, my boy would have provided us
with photos of her reemergence...

37:29.822 --> 37:32.757
but for the unfortunate
occurrence of him...

37:32.825 --> 37:34.258
falling asleep.

37:39.532 --> 37:42.023
Luckily, sir,
the party in question...

37:42.101 --> 37:44.569
mistook him
for an abandoned urchin...

37:44.637 --> 37:46.628
woke him up and led him
to the nearest tube station...

37:46.705 --> 37:49.868
so that the time of reemergence
is definitely established...

37:49.942 --> 37:53.673
as was an acquaintance which may have
its uses in the future, for all we know.

37:54.647 --> 37:57.582
So should I walk in and confront him
like an injured husband?

37:57.650 --> 38:01.245
I'm against it, sir.
It complicates things in the courts.

38:01.320 --> 38:03.254
This will never reach court.

38:03.322 --> 38:06.450
- An amicable settlement then.
- There's lack of interest.

38:06.525 --> 38:09.892
One can hardly make a fuss
about a man called Smythe.

38:09.962 --> 38:12.863
I'd just like to see him,
that's all.

38:12.932 --> 38:16.265
Well, perhaps Lance can oblige us
next time with a frontal.

38:16.335 --> 38:18.269
- Lance?
- My boy.

38:19.071 --> 38:21.130
Called after Lancelot,
the Round Table.

38:21.207 --> 38:23.675
He found the Holy Grail.

38:23.742 --> 38:27.371
That was Galahad. Lancelot
was found in bed with Guinevere.

38:30.082 --> 38:32.016
I hadn't heard.

38:45.431 --> 38:48.798
I have to say, sir,
I would advise against it.

38:48.868 --> 38:53.464
I'd just like to see
what a man called Smythe looks like.

38:53.539 --> 38:56.531
Will you lend me your boy?

38:56.609 --> 39:00.443
Well, if you'll assure me
there'll be nothing unpleasant.

39:00.512 --> 39:04.346
Sarah isn't there. This scene
will have a universal certificate.

39:04.416 --> 39:06.350
Come with me, young Lancelot.

39:07.686 --> 39:09.916
Go on, Lance.

39:09.989 --> 39:12.287
No need to worry.

39:12.358 --> 39:14.553
Now, you're feeling ill,
remember?

39:14.627 --> 39:17.391
- How ill, sir?
- Ill enough to faint.

39:17.463 --> 39:19.397
Can you act that?

39:19.465 --> 39:21.763
If I hold my breath
and go all pale, sir.

39:21.834 --> 39:23.267
Good.

39:33.879 --> 39:36.177
Excuse me, but does
a Dr. Wilson live here?

39:36.248 --> 39:38.409
- No, I'm afraid he doesn't.
- Oh, dear.

39:38.484 --> 39:41.612
See, I was given this address,
and my boy's quite ill.

39:41.687 --> 39:43.917
We've traveled all this...
You all right?

39:43.989 --> 39:46.423
- You better come in.
- Would you mind? I'm sorry.

39:46.492 --> 39:48.824
I think he needs
to sit down badly.

39:48.894 --> 39:50.327
Thank you.

39:54.667 --> 39:58.228
- Can I fetch him a glass of water?
- That's very kind.

39:58.304 --> 40:00.499
Or some orange squash?

40:00.572 --> 40:03.302
- Water will be fine.
- Orange squash, please.

40:03.375 --> 40:05.605
Say thank you, Arthur.

40:05.678 --> 40:09.114
- Is his name Arthur?
- Yes, Arthur James.

40:09.181 --> 40:11.979
- His mother was fond of Tennyson.
- Is she...

40:12.051 --> 40:14.747
Yes, yes. Four years now.

40:16.522 --> 40:19.514
- He must be of great comfort to you.
- And anxiety.

40:19.591 --> 40:22.116
I ought to introduce myself.

40:22.194 --> 40:24.389
- Bridges.
- My name is Smythe.

40:24.463 --> 40:25.497
- With a "Y"?
- Yes. This is my brother Richard.

40:25.497 --> 40:27.556
- With a "Y"?
- Yes. This is my brother Richard.

40:27.733 --> 40:31.225
This is Mr. Bridges.
His boy isn't feeling well.

40:31.303 --> 40:33.897
I was given this address
for a Dr. Wilson.

40:33.973 --> 40:35.770
There's no such doctor here.

40:39.478 --> 40:42.072
I've seen your boy before.

40:42.147 --> 40:44.206
Maybe on the common.

40:49.755 --> 40:53.191
What was the real purpose
of your visit?

40:55.728 --> 40:56.956
I told you. A doctor.

41:02.067 --> 41:04.592
No, you're not ill,
are you, boy?

41:10.642 --> 41:13.577
People sometimes come to me...

41:13.645 --> 41:16.045
and can't explain why.

41:17.416 --> 41:19.577
But if there is a reason...

41:19.651 --> 41:21.585
- My brother often deals...
- Hush, Susan.

41:22.688 --> 41:24.952
They must ask themselves.

41:29.228 --> 41:32.129
I recognize your boy,
but you...

41:33.599 --> 41:37.057
- Who recommended you?
- We have a friend in common.

41:38.270 --> 41:39.703
Sarah Miles.

41:42.007 --> 41:43.941
And your name is?

41:44.009 --> 41:45.840
Bendrix.

41:52.618 --> 41:55.314
- I know all about you.
- I'm sure you do.

41:55.387 --> 41:57.617
But you must enlighten me.

41:57.689 --> 42:01.489
- Aren't you bound by vows of chastity?
- Oh, my dear!

42:02.728 --> 42:04.161
Go, please.

42:05.230 --> 42:07.164
Would you just go?

42:08.233 --> 42:10.326
Come along, Lancelot.

42:16.675 --> 42:19.803
Poor Sarah.
She had committed nothing but love.

42:19.878 --> 42:23.245
And here were Parkis and his boy
watching her every move.

42:23.315 --> 42:25.340
I would have called the spies off...

42:25.417 --> 42:28.113
had the devil not tugged
at my elbow once more.

42:28.187 --> 42:30.348
Henry.

42:30.422 --> 42:32.356
Still in the rain?

42:32.424 --> 42:35.450
Walking, Bendrix.
Doctor recommends it.

42:35.527 --> 42:37.552
Well, walk with me.

42:37.629 --> 42:39.756
I recommend a drink.

42:53.479 --> 42:54.912
How's Sarah?

42:56.081 --> 42:57.673
Pretty well.

42:57.749 --> 43:00.479
Did you ever consult
that private detective?

43:02.354 --> 43:04.345
I'd hoped you had forgotten that.

43:04.423 --> 43:06.755
I was overworked.

43:06.825 --> 43:08.918
I had Royal Commission brewing.

43:08.994 --> 43:11.155
Don't worry, Henry.
I did it for you.

43:12.764 --> 43:15.562
- You had absolutely no right.
- I'm paying all the charges.

43:15.634 --> 43:17.158
It's infernal cheek.

43:17.236 --> 43:19.932
Here's the report, Henry.

43:20.005 --> 43:22.235
His name is Smythe, with a "Y."

43:22.307 --> 43:24.502
You've been properly led up
the garden path, Henry.

43:25.344 --> 43:27.938
- Will you let me pass?
- You don't want them?

43:28.013 --> 43:29.537
Photographs, names, love letters?

43:38.824 --> 43:41.054
Now will you let me go?

43:44.897 --> 43:47.422
I can always get you
a carbon copy.

44:04.516 --> 44:07.883
Strange how much dignity
there can be in a hat.

44:08.954 --> 44:12.390
Without it, he seemed
one of the anonymous...

44:12.457 --> 44:13.890
the dispossessed.

44:15.060 --> 44:18.894
I had pitied myself for so long,
it was odd...

44:18.964 --> 44:21.831
to pity him.

44:21.900 --> 44:23.834
I'm sorry, Henry.

44:26.672 --> 44:28.105
Sit down.

44:39.284 --> 44:41.650
Were you two lovers, Bendrix?

44:46.358 --> 44:48.485
It's the only explanation.

44:49.728 --> 44:51.662
The only excuse too.

44:56.034 --> 44:58.730
Can't you see
that what you've done...

44:58.804 --> 45:00.931
is monstrous?

45:07.512 --> 45:10.447
You must think me a fool
not to have guessed.

45:15.454 --> 45:18.287
Why didn't she leave me?

45:18.357 --> 45:20.723
Because you're a habit
she's formed.

45:20.792 --> 45:23.727
You're her security.

45:23.795 --> 45:26.491
- Why did she leave you?
- I became a bore.

45:26.565 --> 45:28.658
Like you.

45:28.734 --> 45:30.702
But I wasn't born one.

45:30.769 --> 45:33.260
You created me.

45:33.338 --> 45:36.466
She wouldn't leave you,
so I bored her with my jealousy.

45:37.743 --> 45:40.678
- You can't be jealous of me.
- Well, you won, in a way.

45:41.680 --> 45:44.843
We had come to the end of love.

45:44.916 --> 45:47.851
She'd only make love with me,
but...

45:47.919 --> 45:51.047
she could shop and cook
and fall asleep with you.

45:53.225 --> 45:55.557
She's still very fond of you.

45:55.627 --> 45:58.755
One isn't satisfied with fondness.

45:59.931 --> 46:02.195
- I was.
- Yes, and that made you her pimp.

46:03.835 --> 46:06.326
The bore of a husband
who knows where his slippers are...

46:06.405 --> 46:08.999
but never notices his wife.

46:09.074 --> 46:11.065
But you weren't
the only pimp, Henry.

46:11.143 --> 46:14.078
The war was
the greatest pimp of all.

46:15.180 --> 46:18.547
And the V-1 s
never affected us until...

46:18.617 --> 46:20.915
the act of love was over.

46:51.249 --> 46:53.809
So what will you do when it ends?

46:53.885 --> 46:55.819
It won't end. I told you.

46:55.887 --> 46:57.821
I meant the war.

46:59.157 --> 47:01.955
It's the only certain thing.

47:02.027 --> 47:03.961
What do you mean?

47:04.029 --> 47:06.361
That allows me to see you.

47:07.666 --> 47:09.634
You think love ends...

47:09.701 --> 47:11.828
when you don't see me?

47:14.306 --> 47:16.638
To be is to be perceived.

47:17.876 --> 47:20.071
Do I exist for you
when you're with Henry?

47:20.145 --> 47:22.272
Yes.

47:22.347 --> 47:25.043
Isn't that why you stay
with Henry?

47:25.117 --> 47:27.278
Because you know this will end?

47:27.352 --> 47:29.650
No.

47:31.890 --> 47:34.154
- We should go to the basement.
- My landlady might be there.

47:34.226 --> 47:35.750
- Does that matter?
- Maybe to her.

47:35.827 --> 47:38.091
- It's close, Maurice.
- I'll go and check.

47:38.163 --> 47:41.064
- Let me go with you.
- I'll be one second.

47:46.671 --> 47:48.104
Hello?

47:50.742 --> 47:53.438
There's nobody there.
It's clear.

48:45.997 --> 48:47.931
I never heard the bang.

48:49.334 --> 48:52.030
I awoke after five minutes...

48:52.103 --> 48:54.663
or five seconds...

48:55.740 --> 48:57.901
to a changed world.

49:02.914 --> 49:06.247
For a moment,
I was free of feeling...

49:07.319 --> 49:10.413
Love, hate, jealousy.

49:12.023 --> 49:15.083
And it all felt like happiness.

50:25.463 --> 50:27.397
Oh, my God.

50:29.401 --> 50:30.834
You're alive?

50:35.407 --> 50:37.341
You sound disappointed.

50:37.409 --> 50:39.172
You're hurt.

50:43.815 --> 50:46.340
I just cut myself, that's all.

50:58.129 --> 51:00.859
What were you doing
on the floor?

51:02.067 --> 51:03.500
Praying.

51:04.569 --> 51:06.127
To what?

51:06.204 --> 51:08.399
To anything that might exist.

51:09.541 --> 51:14.137
Well, it'd have been more practical
to have come downstairs.

51:14.212 --> 51:16.043
I did.

51:20.485 --> 51:23.784
Well, why didn't you wake me?

51:23.855 --> 51:25.550
I tried.

51:25.624 --> 51:27.558
You didn't move.

51:29.628 --> 51:31.186
I don't understand.

51:32.430 --> 51:35.695
I knew for certain
you were dead.

51:35.767 --> 51:37.894
There wasn't much
to pray for then, was there?

51:38.970 --> 51:40.164
A miracle.

51:42.407 --> 51:45.934
And we don't believe in those.

51:46.011 --> 51:47.103
No.

51:49.614 --> 51:52.515
And that siren means you go.

51:55.587 --> 51:57.111
Yes.

52:02.961 --> 52:04.394
Please don't.

52:05.296 --> 52:08.129
I have to. Henry will...

52:08.199 --> 52:09.860
Forget Henry.

52:11.703 --> 52:13.637
You don't understand.
You were gone.

52:13.705 --> 52:15.104
Now I'm back.

52:16.641 --> 52:19.769
I'm sorry to disappoint you,
Sarah, but...

52:23.948 --> 52:26.678
Love doesn't end...

52:26.751 --> 52:29.049
just because
we don't see each other.

52:29.921 --> 52:31.548
Doesn't it?

52:31.623 --> 52:33.818
People go on loving God,
don't they?

52:33.892 --> 52:36.224
All their lives.

52:36.294 --> 52:38.421
Without seeing Him.

52:39.531 --> 52:41.965
That's not my kind of love.

52:42.033 --> 52:44.729
Maybe there's no other kind.

52:58.850 --> 53:01.648
So I was a disappointment
in the end.

53:01.720 --> 53:03.779
I lived.

53:03.855 --> 53:06.050
And that was the end
of the affair...

53:06.124 --> 53:08.854
until I met you with that
detective's card in your hand.

53:10.762 --> 53:12.753
I wondered why
we hadn't seen you.

53:16.167 --> 53:19.159
You should go home, Henry.
You'll catch your death.

53:23.308 --> 53:24.741
I'm sorry.

53:36.488 --> 53:37.921
Hello.

53:46.931 --> 53:49.559
It was quite easy, sir.
It was such a crush.

53:49.634 --> 53:52.899
And Mrs. Miles thought I was one
of his friends from the ministry.

53:52.971 --> 53:55.439
And Mr. Miles thought
I was one of her friends.

53:56.641 --> 53:59.667
Well, I knew the way
to her room from my boy.

53:59.744 --> 54:02.770
Anybody would have stopped me, I would
have been looking for the toilet.

54:02.847 --> 54:04.337
Of course, nobody did.

54:04.415 --> 54:07.213
Did you think it was
a good cocktail party?

54:07.285 --> 54:09.651
Highly successful
I would say, sir.

54:09.721 --> 54:13.418
But Mrs. Miles
looked a bit out of sorts.

54:13.491 --> 54:17.655
I refer to this as Exhibit "D."

54:29.941 --> 54:31.875
Did you look at it?

54:31.943 --> 54:34.241
I ascertained its nature, sir.

54:34.312 --> 54:36.712
And from one entry, judged
she wasn't the cautious type.

54:36.781 --> 54:39.147
So happy. M returns today.

54:39.217 --> 54:42.186
My experience of diaries
is they always give things away, sir.

54:43.721 --> 54:46.622
People invent their little codes.
You soon see through them, sir.

54:46.691 --> 54:48.921
I woke up and
the sun was shining.

54:48.993 --> 54:51.518
This covers several years.

54:51.596 --> 54:53.530
I hope you're satisfied, sir.

54:53.598 --> 54:57.261
Life was going to be happy again.
But last night I dreamt...

54:57.335 --> 55:00.634
I think this may well
close our account, Parkis.

55:00.705 --> 55:03.902
Yeah. I had a feeling
it might, sir.

55:04.709 --> 55:07.303
I have enjoyed
our association, sir...

55:07.378 --> 55:10.905
if one can talk of enjoying
under the sad circumstances.

55:10.982 --> 55:12.813
As have I.

55:12.884 --> 55:16.251
So I hope you wouldn't
resent a memento, sir.

55:21.659 --> 55:23.251
There's quite a history
with that.

55:24.395 --> 55:27.626
- Do you remember the Bolton case?
- I can't say I do.

55:27.699 --> 55:30.167
It caused quite
a stir at the time, sir.

55:30.235 --> 55:32.829
Lady Bolton,
her maid and a man.

55:32.904 --> 55:34.963
All discovered together.

55:35.039 --> 55:37.564
That ashtray stood
beside the bed, sir.

55:37.642 --> 55:39.610
On the lady's side.

55:43.381 --> 55:46.077
Well, I shall treasure it, Parkis.

55:47.886 --> 55:50.411
If ashtrays could speak, sir.

55:50.488 --> 55:51.921
Indeed.

55:55.426 --> 55:58.520
Perhaps I should call later, sir, just
to make sure there were no loose ends?

55:58.596 --> 56:00.530
Thank you, Parkis.

56:02.700 --> 56:04.565
- Good night, sir.
- Good night.

56:35.967 --> 56:40.267
Sometimes I get tired of trying
to convince him that I love him...

56:40.338 --> 56:42.465
and shall love him forever.

56:42.540 --> 56:46.032
He pounces on my words
like a barrister and twists them.

56:46.110 --> 56:48.044
So what will you do
when it ends?

56:48.112 --> 56:51.604
You think love ends
when you don't see me?

56:53.952 --> 56:56.443
To be is to be perceived.

56:57.622 --> 56:59.920
Do I exist for you
when you're with Henry?

56:59.991 --> 57:01.424
Yes.

57:02.593 --> 57:07.428
Isn't that why you stay with Henry?
Because you know this will end?

57:11.369 --> 57:13.667
- We should go to the basement.
- My landlady might be there.

57:13.738 --> 57:15.171
- Does that matter?
- Maybe to her.

57:15.239 --> 57:17.571
- It's close, Maurice.
- I'll go and check.

57:17.642 --> 57:19.940
- Let me go with you.
- I'll be one second.

57:25.883 --> 57:27.316
Hello?

57:30.822 --> 57:32.414
There's nobody there.
It's clear.

58:00.351 --> 58:01.875
Oh, God!

58:07.558 --> 58:09.492
Oh, God. Oh, God.

58:21.506 --> 58:23.303
Oh, God, don't take him.

58:23.975 --> 58:25.943
But You had.

58:29.080 --> 58:31.674
Whatever was him was gone.

58:31.749 --> 58:33.683
You'd taken it.

58:36.421 --> 58:38.981
I'd never believed in prayer.

58:42.026 --> 58:46.019
Oh, God, please bring him back.
Let him live.

58:46.097 --> 58:49.498
I don't believe in You,
but please let him live.

58:52.103 --> 58:54.469
Dear God, please.

58:55.540 --> 58:57.098
Let him...

59:11.923 --> 59:15.188
Dear God, please. Let him live.

59:18.663 --> 59:21.223
Please bring him back.

59:22.300 --> 59:24.564
Please don't take him.

59:27.238 --> 59:29.331
I'll give him up forever.

59:29.407 --> 59:32.035
Only please, let him be alive.

59:33.344 --> 59:38.213
Let him live and I promise
I'll never see him again.

59:46.424 --> 59:47.686
Oh, my God.

59:50.528 --> 59:51.995
You're alive?

59:54.398 --> 59:57.265
You sound disappointed.

59:57.335 --> 01:00:01.169
But if he was alive,
now I was dead.

01:00:10.281 --> 01:00:12.579
What were you doing on the floor?

01:00:14.185 --> 01:00:16.517
Praying.

01:00:16.587 --> 01:00:18.350
To what?

01:00:18.422 --> 01:00:20.390
To anything that might exist.

01:00:20.458 --> 01:00:24.656
How could I explain to him
what made no sense to me?

01:00:24.729 --> 01:00:26.390
You didn't move.

01:00:26.464 --> 01:00:30.127
I knew for certain you were dead.

01:00:30.201 --> 01:00:32.260
Then there wasn't much
to pray for then, was there?

01:00:32.336 --> 01:00:33.769
A miracle.

01:00:35.540 --> 01:00:38.236
And we don't believe in that.

01:00:42.013 --> 01:00:44.106
And that siren means you go.

01:00:47.018 --> 01:00:48.451
Yes.

01:00:49.620 --> 01:00:54.648
And I knew that nothing in this world
would make sense to me again.

01:00:55.726 --> 01:00:57.057
Sorry to disappoint you.

01:01:02.066 --> 01:01:04.728
Love doesn't end...

01:01:04.802 --> 01:01:06.736
just because we don't
see each other.

01:01:07.772 --> 01:01:09.262
Doesn't it?

01:01:09.340 --> 01:01:11.570
People go on loving God,
don't they...

01:01:11.642 --> 01:01:15.544
all their lives
without seeing Him?

01:01:15.613 --> 01:01:18.673
That's not my kind of love.

01:01:19.550 --> 01:01:22.144
Maybe there's no other kind.

01:01:42.373 --> 01:01:45.570
I can't be held to that promise.

01:01:45.643 --> 01:01:48.476
But something told me I would be.

01:01:48.546 --> 01:01:50.480
I had tempted fate...

01:01:50.548 --> 01:01:52.709
and fate had accepted.

01:01:53.951 --> 01:01:58.854
So I was in the desert now,
the desert without him.

01:02:00.958 --> 01:02:05.395
I started a tour with Henry,
civil defense in southern England.

01:02:06.364 --> 01:02:10.300
Henry and I sleeping side by side
like figures on tombs.

01:02:12.870 --> 01:02:16.533
In the new reinforced shelter
at Bigwell-on-Sea...

01:02:16.607 --> 01:02:19.303
a chief warden kissed me.

01:02:19.377 --> 01:02:22.813
I allowed him to
but felt nothing.

01:02:24.248 --> 01:02:27.115
I'm beginning to believe
in You, God...

01:02:27.184 --> 01:02:29.914
and maybe that's how You work.

01:02:29.987 --> 01:02:33.821
You empty me of love,
then fill that emptiness.

01:02:33.891 --> 01:02:36.018
They're recommending me
for an O.B.E.

01:02:36.093 --> 01:02:37.788
What's that?

01:02:37.862 --> 01:02:40.330
A step below a C.B.E.

01:02:40.398 --> 01:02:43.925
When I retire,
I'll probably be a K.B.E.

01:02:44.001 --> 01:02:47.459
It's confusing. Couldn't
they stick to the same letters?

01:02:48.739 --> 01:02:51.173
Wouldn't you like to be Lady Miles?

01:02:54.779 --> 01:02:57.873
This was the British people's
finest day...

01:02:57.948 --> 01:03:01.543
V-E day,
the end of the German war.

01:03:04.522 --> 01:03:07.082
A man we seem to have
seen before somewhere...

01:03:07.158 --> 01:03:09.752
Looks down
from a balcony in Whitehall.

01:03:21.706 --> 01:03:25.005
The whole of London seemed happy
because there was peace...

01:03:25.076 --> 01:03:27.067
and there were no more bombs.

01:03:27.144 --> 01:03:29.772
But I'm not sure
I like the peace.

01:03:38.522 --> 01:03:40.581
I walked his walks.

01:03:43.427 --> 01:03:46.021
Tried to think where he'd be.

01:03:51.202 --> 01:03:53.136
Then I gave up.

01:03:54.672 --> 01:03:57.470
I thought that now
the world is at peace...

01:03:57.541 --> 01:03:59.941
maybe I should have some.

01:04:12.690 --> 01:04:14.783
I told him it all.

01:04:14.859 --> 01:04:19.592
And Whoever heard my promise
must have heard it too...

01:04:19.663 --> 01:04:22.325
and must have known it already...

01:04:22.400 --> 01:04:25.198
since God knows everything.

01:04:27.905 --> 01:04:31.068
How cruel that knowledge seemed.

01:04:31.142 --> 01:04:34.305
It knew what I would say
before I made that promise.

01:04:35.946 --> 01:04:39.143
Knew it would keep me to it.

01:04:39.216 --> 01:04:41.810
Knew me the way
his hands knew me.

01:04:42.920 --> 01:04:44.785
Sarah, darling.

01:04:47.558 --> 01:04:48.650
You.

01:04:48.726 --> 01:04:50.717
Knew I would meet him
on the stairs.

01:04:50.795 --> 01:04:52.729
- Been out for a walk?
- Yes.

01:04:52.797 --> 01:04:54.094
It's a filthy night.

01:04:54.165 --> 01:04:57.157
You're wet through. One day
you'll catch your death of cold.

01:04:57.234 --> 01:04:58.360
Good night.

01:04:59.303 --> 01:05:01.794
Knew he would hate me.

01:05:07.912 --> 01:05:10.278
- Wednesday.
- Wednesday. Let me check.

01:05:12.716 --> 01:05:15.150
- Would Thursday do?
- Thursday then.

01:05:15.219 --> 01:05:17.653
The Park Lane Hotel at 1::00.

01:05:21.959 --> 01:05:26.020
I took my time.
I didn't want to be early.

01:05:27.097 --> 01:05:29.156
Why did you want to meet?

01:05:29.233 --> 01:05:34.034
I wanted to tell you I'd been dead
for the last two years.

01:05:34.104 --> 01:05:37.130
I can't be without you any longer.

01:05:37.208 --> 01:05:38.505
I think he's lonely.

01:05:38.576 --> 01:05:40.567
But, of course, I didn't.

01:05:40.644 --> 01:05:43.909
You know he's never really
noticed me, not for years.

01:05:46.417 --> 01:05:48.749
Maybe you've given him reason.

01:05:48.819 --> 01:05:51.185
What reason could I give?

01:05:52.690 --> 01:05:55.124
What reason did you give me?

01:06:00.197 --> 01:06:01.425
None.

01:06:11.775 --> 01:06:14.767
- Are you on a new book?
- Of course.

01:06:14.845 --> 01:06:18.042
It's not about us, is it?
The one you threatened to write.

01:06:18.115 --> 01:06:19.878
A book takes a year to write.

01:06:19.950 --> 01:06:21.884
It's too hard work for revenge.

01:06:22.987 --> 01:06:25.114
If you knew how little
you had to revenge...

01:06:25.189 --> 01:06:27.885
No, I'm joking.
We had a good time together.

01:06:27.958 --> 01:06:29.892
I mean, we're adults and...

01:06:29.960 --> 01:06:32.952
we knew it had to end sometime.

01:06:33.030 --> 01:06:36.158
And now we can lunch
and talk about Henry.

01:06:41.138 --> 01:06:44.335
In the old days,
he would have followed.

01:06:44.408 --> 01:06:48.071
We would have made up
or made love.

01:07:06.397 --> 01:07:11.460
I said to God, as I might
have said to my father...

01:07:11.535 --> 01:07:14.163
"Dear God, I'm tired.

01:07:15.239 --> 01:07:18.766
I'm tired of being without him.

01:07:18.842 --> 01:07:21.436
And it's all because of You."

01:07:23.714 --> 01:07:27.480
Dr. Gilbert's appointment.
I'd almost forgotten.

01:07:28.519 --> 01:07:30.487
He asked me how I felt.

01:07:31.555 --> 01:07:34.251
I said I felt nothing.

01:07:34.325 --> 01:07:37.294
There was a stone
where my heart should be.

01:07:39.730 --> 01:07:41.664
I need help, Father.

01:07:43.500 --> 01:07:45.434
You know, Sarah,
God granted us free will.

01:07:45.502 --> 01:07:48.869
Good. So it's settled.
I'm leaving my husband.

01:07:48.939 --> 01:07:53.000
- You can't.
- Why can't I? I'm a whore and a liar.

01:07:53.077 --> 01:07:55.443
I'm asking Henry for a divorce.

01:08:01.685 --> 01:08:03.846
You can't because you're good.

01:08:05.756 --> 01:08:08.554
Better than any person I know.

01:08:08.626 --> 01:08:12.585
You're wrong, Father,
and you don't know me.

01:08:14.598 --> 01:08:17.828
I found a small boy
sleeping on the steps...

01:08:17.901 --> 01:08:20.768
with a birthmark
covering his face...

01:08:20.837 --> 01:08:24.274
and wondered what kind of God
would give a child that.

01:08:24.341 --> 01:08:26.366
Are you lost?

01:08:26.443 --> 01:08:29.412
It's all right.
It's all right.

01:08:29.479 --> 01:08:31.448
Where do you live then?

01:08:33.617 --> 01:08:35.743
- You'll be all right now?
- Yes, ma'am.

01:08:35.819 --> 01:08:40.881
I kissed his cheek
and wished I could wash it away.

01:08:40.957 --> 01:08:42.892
And suddenly I felt happy again.

01:08:43.961 --> 01:08:45.895
I could free myself of this.

01:08:46.863 --> 01:08:49.594
I am...

01:08:49.667 --> 01:08:51.497
leaving you.

01:08:52.569 --> 01:08:56.595
For the last five years...

01:08:57.774 --> 01:09:00.767
I have been...

01:09:00.844 --> 01:09:02.778
in love...

01:09:02.845 --> 01:09:05.144
with Maurice.

01:09:05.215 --> 01:09:08.082
I love you.

01:09:08.152 --> 01:09:10.211
Do you know that?

01:09:15.292 --> 01:09:17.920
Why now, Henry?

01:09:17.995 --> 01:09:19.929
Why do you say that now?

01:09:23.100 --> 01:09:25.227
I had a drink with Bendrix.

01:09:31.642 --> 01:09:33.803
A horrible drink.

01:09:35.979 --> 01:09:38.140
I can't do without you.

01:09:39.216 --> 01:09:41.616
Oh, yes, you can, I thought.

01:09:41.685 --> 01:09:45.587
You changed your newspaper once
and you soon got used to it.

01:09:45.656 --> 01:09:47.749
What's wrong, Henry?

01:09:47.825 --> 01:09:50.885
Did Bendrix upset you in some way?

01:09:53.831 --> 01:09:56.766
I know I haven't been much
of a husband to you, my dear.

01:09:56.834 --> 01:09:58.802
We are good friends.

01:10:00.337 --> 01:10:03.135
You can do without a friend.

01:10:04.341 --> 01:10:06.275
Don't leave me, Sarah.

01:10:08.846 --> 01:10:11.178
Stick it out a few more years.

01:10:12.416 --> 01:10:15.544
I'll try. I promise.

01:10:20.791 --> 01:10:24.420
Is this coincidence?
I wondered.

01:10:24.495 --> 01:10:27.293
Or the way life happens?

01:10:27.364 --> 01:10:32.097
And if this is life,
am I stuck with it?

01:10:32.169 --> 01:10:34.569
But whatever it is...

01:10:34.638 --> 01:10:36.629
I can't fight it anymore.

01:10:37.374 --> 01:10:41.242
It has won and we have lost.

01:10:56.960 --> 01:10:58.894
- Hello?
- Sarah.

01:10:59.963 --> 01:11:01.794
She's not here.

01:11:01.865 --> 01:11:04.993
I know your voice, Sarah.
Talk to me.

01:11:54.184 --> 01:11:55.446
Stop here.

01:11:57.321 --> 01:11:59.949
- Thank you.
- Thank you very much, guv.

01:12:11.268 --> 01:12:13.065
One, please.

01:12:16.139 --> 01:12:17.731
Thank you, sir.

01:13:08.592 --> 01:13:10.787
How did you get it?

01:13:15.232 --> 01:13:17.564
You had a drinks party last week.

01:13:19.236 --> 01:13:22.171
- Yes. That small man.
- Yes.

01:13:23.240 --> 01:13:25.208
He is my snoop.

01:13:28.478 --> 01:13:29.911
How ridiculous.

01:13:31.548 --> 01:13:34.676
It's no more
ridiculous than you.

01:13:34.751 --> 01:13:36.912
Why didn't you tell me?

01:13:36.987 --> 01:13:41.924
I tried. Each time I tried,
something would happen.

01:13:41.992 --> 01:13:46.088
- That's mumbo jumbo, Sarah.
- It doesn't work like that.

01:13:46.163 --> 01:13:47.596
Accidents.

01:13:47.664 --> 01:13:52.465
Little things.
God is in the details, Maurice.

01:13:52.536 --> 01:13:54.333
You can't believe that.

01:13:54.404 --> 01:13:57.032
Do you believe in things
you can't see?

01:13:59.409 --> 01:14:01.377
- You mean Him?
- I mean you.

01:14:03.914 --> 01:14:08.078
You see, I never stopped loving you,
even though I couldn't see you.

01:14:11.021 --> 01:14:14.184
My mother baptized me a Catholic.

01:14:14.257 --> 01:14:17.886
My father was Jewish,
so we never practiced.

01:14:17.961 --> 01:14:21.590
But she always said
she hoped it would take.

01:14:21.665 --> 01:14:23.462
Like a vaccination.

01:14:25.435 --> 01:14:29.769
I've only made
two promises in my life.

01:14:29.840 --> 01:14:32.638
One was to marry Henry...

01:14:32.709 --> 01:14:35.177
the other to stop seeing you.

01:14:37.214 --> 01:14:39.876
And I'm too weak to keep either.

01:14:43.220 --> 01:14:45.484
I know you don't believe in Him...

01:14:47.824 --> 01:14:50.088
but try to.

01:14:50.160 --> 01:14:52.025
Talk to Him.

01:14:53.096 --> 01:14:54.427
I can't.

01:14:54.498 --> 01:14:56.432
Tell Him I'm sorry.

01:14:56.500 --> 01:14:58.798
I'm too human...

01:14:58.869 --> 01:15:01.429
too weak.

01:15:01.505 --> 01:15:06.442
Tell Him I can't keep my promises.

01:15:06.510 --> 01:15:09.411
I'm tired of being without you.

01:15:12.516 --> 01:15:16.612
- Let's get you home.
- I don't want to go home.

01:15:17.521 --> 01:15:18.954
I know.

01:16:03.667 --> 01:16:06.227
So have we broken the spell?

01:16:10.173 --> 01:16:12.164
The world didn't end, did it?

01:16:12.242 --> 01:16:14.574
It did, in a way.

01:16:14.644 --> 01:16:16.612
But then, it always did.

01:16:18.748 --> 01:16:20.682
Can I sleep now, Maurice?

01:16:21.751 --> 01:16:23.685
Please let me sleep.

01:16:51.581 --> 01:16:53.549
- It's Henry.
- Don't answer it.

01:16:53.617 --> 01:16:56.745
Why not? We'll have
to tell him sometime.

01:16:56.820 --> 01:16:59.345
- Come away with me.
- Where?

01:16:59.422 --> 01:17:01.583
Anywhere. Brighton.

01:17:02.359 --> 01:17:04.725
I want a few days peace
before the arguments begin.

01:17:05.862 --> 01:17:08.922
- Well, Henry never argues.
- I wasn't talking about Henry.

01:17:14.738 --> 01:17:16.933
Pain is easy to write.

01:17:18.008 --> 01:17:21.205
In pain, we're
all drably individual.

01:17:22.312 --> 01:17:24.246
But what can one write
about happiness?

01:17:49.806 --> 01:17:52.434
It doesn't suit you.
And it's mine.

01:17:52.509 --> 01:17:55.171
- You want it? There's a price.
- How much?

01:17:59.950 --> 01:18:01.884
Can I pay again?

01:18:04.688 --> 01:18:08.124
- I want children, you know.
- How many?

01:18:08.191 --> 01:18:11.422
- I'll start with one.
- Only one?

01:18:11.494 --> 01:18:13.428
You want to start with two?

01:18:14.464 --> 01:18:16.591
Is that a promise?

01:18:16.666 --> 01:18:18.099
Yes.

01:18:26.243 --> 01:18:28.177
Let's get you back to the hotel.

01:18:33.216 --> 01:18:36.185
- Just those two.
- Very good, sir.

01:18:48.698 --> 01:18:51.098
It is a bit of a mess.
Yeah, you're right.

01:18:55.372 --> 01:18:57.840
- Business going well?
- Yes, it's going...

01:18:57.907 --> 01:18:59.841
Still on the job?
Don't worry.

01:18:59.909 --> 01:19:02.139
- Oh, dear.
- Here. Come with me.

01:19:02.212 --> 01:19:04.976
Come. So where's
your boy this time?

01:19:05.048 --> 01:19:07.107
I left him at home, sir.

01:19:07.183 --> 01:19:10.778
Hardly a wise move. He'd have
had the sense not to get noticed.

01:19:10.854 --> 01:19:14.051
You think so, sir?
Perhaps I wasn't cut out for this job.

01:19:14.124 --> 01:19:17.389
Tell your employer
the circumstances are unique.

01:19:17.460 --> 01:19:21.897
What was your phrase?
The party in question is a writer.

01:19:21.965 --> 01:19:25.401
- They notice everything.
- They certainly seem to, sir.

01:19:27.170 --> 01:19:30.662
- So who's hired you this time?
- I'm not at liberty to say, sir.

01:19:30.740 --> 01:19:33.300
Let me guess. The jealous husband.

01:19:36.112 --> 01:19:38.478
I never expected to be
recalled to this case, sir.

01:19:38.548 --> 01:19:40.516
Yours is a secure profession.

01:19:40.583 --> 01:19:44.280
As long as fools like us love,
your employment never ends.

01:19:44.354 --> 01:19:46.288
You could put it like that.

01:19:46.356 --> 01:19:48.756
And love never ends, does it?

01:19:49.926 --> 01:19:51.518
It seems not.

01:19:51.594 --> 01:19:53.619
So what do you need?

01:19:53.697 --> 01:19:56.427
Photographs of us
in flagrante delicto?

01:19:56.499 --> 01:20:00.868
Copies of hotel bills? Evidence of
soiled sheets? We'd be happy to oblige.

01:20:00.937 --> 01:20:05.601
No, my brief is to follow you.
Inform him as to your whereabouts.

01:20:05.675 --> 01:20:07.609
Which, of course, you'll do.

01:20:07.677 --> 01:20:10.737
I'm obliged to, sir, under
the terms of my employment, posthaste.

01:20:10.814 --> 01:20:14.306
Won't you need supplementary evidence?
The divorce courts will demand it.

01:20:16.686 --> 01:20:19.780
They generally do, sir,
if it come to that.

01:20:19.856 --> 01:20:23.519
Well, Exhibit "A."

01:20:23.593 --> 01:20:28.053
Receipt for two sandwiches
bought on the train to Brighton.

01:20:28.131 --> 01:20:31.589
Mutual sandwiches are surely
evidence of intimacy, aren't they?

01:20:31.668 --> 01:20:34.466
- They could be so construed, sir.
- Exhibit "B."

01:20:34.537 --> 01:20:36.471
Two tickets for a Big Dipper.

01:20:36.539 --> 01:20:39.770
- You seem to be doing my job for me.
- Yes, but we haven't quite got there.

01:20:39.843 --> 01:20:42.437
What would clinch it for us?

01:20:42.512 --> 01:20:45.743
What would make
divorce a certainty?

01:20:50.920 --> 01:20:55.948
Generally, sir, some kind
of photographic evidence of...

01:20:57.961 --> 01:20:59.929
Of intimacy.

01:21:02.599 --> 01:21:06.797
Would be most useful, sir,
if it came to such a pass.

01:21:06.870 --> 01:21:10.670
It will, Parkis.
It most certainly will.

01:21:42.405 --> 01:21:43.838
Here.

01:21:51.047 --> 01:21:53.015
I dreamt we had a child.

01:21:53.082 --> 01:21:55.107
We will.

01:21:55.185 --> 01:21:57.278
We were on the bed together.

01:21:57.353 --> 01:22:01.414
The room filled up with water.
There was a child between us.

01:22:01.491 --> 01:22:03.789
Why water?

01:22:03.860 --> 01:22:06.454
The sea had come in the window.

01:22:23.847 --> 01:22:26.475
So you'll marry me.

01:22:29.719 --> 01:22:31.914
That's a promise.

01:23:02.285 --> 01:23:06.278
The prince regent began building it
for his mistress, Mrs. Fitzherbert.

01:23:06.356 --> 01:23:08.324
Beautiful but flawed.

01:23:08.391 --> 01:23:11.417
- How was she flawed?
- She was Catholic.

01:23:11.494 --> 01:23:13.689
Impossible, of course.

01:23:13.763 --> 01:23:15.390
So he loved her.

01:23:15.465 --> 01:23:20.664
Yes, but he married Princess Caroline
of Brunswick who was Protestant...

01:23:20.737 --> 01:23:22.432
but huge.

01:23:22.505 --> 01:23:26.498
And he built this huge folly
to impossibility.

01:23:26.576 --> 01:23:29.306
- Not now, Henry.
- Forgive me, Sarah. I had to.

01:23:29.379 --> 01:23:33.247
- Oh, God, please. Henry, not now.
- You had to what, Henry?

01:23:35.151 --> 01:23:37.346
- Talk.
- Go back home.

01:23:37.420 --> 01:23:39.650
- You can't hold on to her forever.
- I know, but...

01:23:39.722 --> 01:23:43.954
It hardly suits you, Henry,
the role of a jealous husband.

01:23:44.027 --> 01:23:46.257
Please, I don't mean
to make a scene.

01:23:46.329 --> 01:23:49.298
Henry, go home.

01:23:49.365 --> 01:23:51.856
I'm not jealous, Bendrix.

01:23:52.936 --> 01:23:54.870
What was it you said?

01:23:54.938 --> 01:23:58.965
Lovers are jealous.
Husbands are ridiculous.

01:24:01.244 --> 01:24:03.735
I was never her lover.

01:24:03.813 --> 01:24:05.872
Not much of a husband either,
I'm afraid.

01:24:05.949 --> 01:24:08.213
But you hired our detective.

01:24:08.284 --> 01:24:10.548
I had to find out where she was.

01:24:10.620 --> 01:24:15.023
So you know. She wants a divorce.

01:24:15.091 --> 01:24:18.322
That won't be possible, old man.

01:24:18.394 --> 01:24:20.328
You'll contest it?

01:24:20.396 --> 01:24:23.593
No, but it would take
at least three months.

01:24:23.666 --> 01:24:27.033
Well, what's three months, Henry,
out of a lifetime?

01:24:28.471 --> 01:24:30.769
Half.

01:24:30.840 --> 01:24:33.331
Half of what?

01:24:33.409 --> 01:24:35.877
Of a lifetime, I'm afraid.

01:24:37.814 --> 01:24:40.806
Sarah's dying.

01:24:40.883 --> 01:24:44.910
Her doctor called the night
she didn't come back...

01:24:44.988 --> 01:24:47.320
with the result of some tests.

01:24:49.058 --> 01:24:51.049
I knocked on your door.

01:24:52.829 --> 01:24:55.229
I imagined you were both there.

01:24:58.468 --> 01:25:01.266
How oddly we behave
at such moments.

01:25:17.987 --> 01:25:20.353
You shouldn't get wet, darling.

01:25:20.423 --> 01:25:23.085
- Don't you like the rain, Henry?
- Yes, dear, but...

01:25:23.159 --> 01:25:27.289
You've heard news, Henry.
Is it good?

01:25:28.564 --> 01:25:30.031
No, dear.

01:25:31.401 --> 01:25:36.134
You see, Maurice, never make a promise.
You may have to keep it.

01:25:43.846 --> 01:25:47.839
You should never have been
jealous of me, Bendrix.

01:25:52.689 --> 01:25:58.286
I did Sarah a great disservice
when I married her. I realize that now.

01:25:59.696 --> 01:26:02.164
I'm not the sort
that makes a lover.

01:26:04.467 --> 01:26:07.061
She wanted someone like you.

01:26:07.904 --> 01:26:10.395
I'm not sure
it's as simple as that.

01:26:14.444 --> 01:26:16.935
If you don't mind me asking...

01:26:18.214 --> 01:26:21.445
I'd like you there
when the time comes.

01:26:21.517 --> 01:26:23.007
It may not come.

01:26:25.221 --> 01:26:28.315
You of all people
don't believe in miracles.

01:26:28.391 --> 01:26:30.757
No, but Sarah does.

01:26:34.297 --> 01:26:38.233
I'd always believed that
I'd be the one to die first...

01:26:39.936 --> 01:26:42.632
and that Sarah
would know what to do.

01:26:46.209 --> 01:26:48.268
Are you at a loss, Henry?

01:26:52.215 --> 01:26:54.149
I am quite.

01:26:57.153 --> 01:27:01.351
And it would save you a bit
if you moved in with us.

01:27:01.424 --> 01:27:06.191
Sarah always said your books weren't
as successful as they should have been.

01:27:09.532 --> 01:27:15.232
You could be there, working in
the daytime, while I'm at the ministry.

01:27:15.304 --> 01:27:19.866
And at night, we could both...

01:27:26.783 --> 01:27:30.583
And so I moved to the north side
of the common...

01:27:30.653 --> 01:27:34.589
and, oddly enough,
I felt instantly at home.

01:27:44.100 --> 01:27:45.863
Can I help you, Father?

01:27:47.804 --> 01:27:50.534
- I've come about Mrs. Miles.
- She's indisposed.

01:27:50.606 --> 01:27:53.837
You mean, she's ill, don't you?

01:27:53.910 --> 01:27:57.437
- Yes, I suppose I do.
- Yes.

01:27:58.514 --> 01:28:02.314
She's been to see me several times,
and I know she'd like to see me before...

01:28:02.385 --> 01:28:05.479
She's left word with me
she's not to be disturbed.

01:28:05.555 --> 01:28:07.489
Is her husband here?

01:28:15.565 --> 01:28:19.934
- She told me about you.
- I know she did.

01:28:20.002 --> 01:28:21.936
I'm the lover, Father.

01:28:36.252 --> 01:28:38.186
Who was that?

01:28:45.595 --> 01:28:47.028
The postman.

01:28:50.166 --> 01:28:52.134
What did he bring?

01:28:54.403 --> 01:28:56.871
He had the wrong address.

01:29:01.077 --> 01:29:03.910
How odd for a postman.

01:29:14.257 --> 01:29:17.226
You know what happened that day?

01:29:19.395 --> 01:29:21.955
You thought I was dead...

01:29:22.031 --> 01:29:23.965
and I wasn't.

01:29:26.302 --> 01:29:27.769
No, darling.

01:29:29.705 --> 01:29:32.173
Something happened in that room.

01:29:33.976 --> 01:29:38.037
There were the same walls
around me...

01:29:38.114 --> 01:29:41.572
the same sunlight
coming in the window...

01:29:43.786 --> 01:29:47.153
but nothing will
ever be the same again.

01:29:48.591 --> 01:29:51.355
You can't believe this, Sarah.

01:29:53.663 --> 01:29:56.063
But it's true.

01:29:57.433 --> 01:30:00.664
I never loved anyone
as I loved you.

01:30:02.305 --> 01:30:06.002
And when you came through that door
with blood on your face...

01:30:08.411 --> 01:30:11.073
another kind of love
came with you.

01:30:12.815 --> 01:30:15.306
And I caught belief...

01:30:15.384 --> 01:30:16.976
like a disease.

01:30:18.287 --> 01:30:20.812
I fell into belief like I'd...

01:30:22.224 --> 01:30:24.317
fallen into love.

01:30:25.394 --> 01:30:27.885
And I tried to fight it...

01:30:30.599 --> 01:30:33.534
but I haven't any fight left.

01:30:55.324 --> 01:30:57.622
It wasn't the postman, was it?

01:30:59.595 --> 01:31:01.495
No, it wasn't.

01:31:03.632 --> 01:31:06.760
Dear Maurice,
you can't go on fighting.

01:31:06.836 --> 01:31:09.430
It's only love, after all.

01:31:45.474 --> 01:31:48.534
So You're taking her...

01:31:48.611 --> 01:31:51.341
but You haven't got me yet.

01:31:51.414 --> 01:31:54.440
I don't want Your peace
and Your love.

01:31:55.718 --> 01:31:58.846
I wanted Sarah for a lifetime...

01:31:58.921 --> 01:32:01.321
and You're taking her from me.

01:32:02.391 --> 01:32:04.985
So I hate You, God.

01:32:06.062 --> 01:32:10.089
I hate You as though You existed.

01:32:27.016 --> 01:32:30.816
You have to help me, Bendrix.
I can't.

01:32:30.886 --> 01:32:32.717
I will.

01:32:32.788 --> 01:32:35.518
I can't live in a world
where she's gone.

01:32:39.228 --> 01:32:41.355
I'll help you.

01:32:57.613 --> 01:33:01.481
I would have taken care of
all the arrangements, if I'd known.

01:33:01.550 --> 01:33:03.711
Surely you disapprove of cremation?

01:33:03.786 --> 01:33:05.811
I would have arranged
a Catholic burial.

01:33:05.888 --> 01:33:08.152
But she wasn't a Catholic,
was she, Henry?

01:33:08.224 --> 01:33:10.658
We recognize
the baptism of desire.

01:33:12.761 --> 01:33:15.355
She said things
that seemed like prayers.

01:33:15.431 --> 01:33:18.594
We've made all the arrangements.
We can't alter things now, Father.

01:33:18.667 --> 01:33:21.158
You wouldn't want talk, Henry.
There's the notice in the Times.

01:33:23.639 --> 01:33:26.802
If you'd come a little sooner, Father...
Please, don't think...

01:33:26.876 --> 01:33:28.844
I think nothing
bad of you, Mr. Miles.

01:33:28.911 --> 01:33:31.379
- Perhaps me?
- Don't worry, Mr. Bendrix.

01:33:31.447 --> 01:33:34.007
Nothing you can do
will affect her now.

01:33:37.920 --> 01:33:40.514
- She was a good woman.
- She was nothing of the sort.

01:33:40.589 --> 01:33:42.523
She could put the blinkers
on any man.

01:33:42.591 --> 01:33:44.991
She deceived you, Father,
as she deceived her husband and me.

01:33:45.060 --> 01:33:46.994
- She was a consummate liar.
- You've no right.

01:33:47.062 --> 01:33:49.860
- Let the poor man rave.
- Don't give me your professional pity!

01:33:49.932 --> 01:33:53.231
- Keep it for your confessional!
- You can find me there anytime you want.

01:33:53.302 --> 01:33:54.894
I don't want you.
I'm no Sarah.

01:33:54.970 --> 01:33:56.733
- I'm sorry, Father.
- No need to be.

01:33:57.940 --> 01:33:59.965
I know when a man is in pain.

01:34:02.344 --> 01:34:05.438
I'm not in pain, Father.
I'm in hate.

01:34:05.514 --> 01:34:08.915
I hate Sarah, because she was
a tart to your mumbo jumbo.

01:34:08.984 --> 01:34:11.350
I hate Henry,
because she stuck to him.

01:34:11.420 --> 01:34:16.323
And I hate you and your imaginary God,
because you took her away from us.

01:34:18.727 --> 01:34:21.821
- You are a good hater.
- To hell with all of you!

01:35:01.170 --> 01:35:03.434
I'm sorry, Henry.

01:35:10.412 --> 01:35:12.607
The thing is, Bendrix...

01:35:14.416 --> 01:35:16.475
I always knew.

01:35:18.787 --> 01:35:21.017
I knew she was with someone...

01:35:23.025 --> 01:35:25.255
but I never thought you.

01:35:28.731 --> 01:35:30.699
But the odd thing is...

01:35:32.568 --> 01:35:34.536
I'm glad it was.

01:35:54.290 --> 01:35:57.782
It's a sad pleasure
to see you here, sir...

01:35:57.860 --> 01:35:59.828
where bygones are always bygones.

01:35:59.895 --> 01:36:03.160
Do you always follow your people
as far as this?

01:36:04.233 --> 01:36:07.031
She was a very fine lady, sir.

01:36:07.102 --> 01:36:10.003
At a cocktail party,
she handed me a glass of sherry.

01:36:10.072 --> 01:36:12.540
Was it South African sherry?

01:36:12.608 --> 01:36:14.576
I wouldn't know, sir.

01:36:14.643 --> 01:36:17.237
There weren't many like her.

01:36:17.313 --> 01:36:20.111
My boy, now,
he's always speaking of her.

01:36:20.182 --> 01:36:22.946
How is your boy, Parkis?

01:36:23.018 --> 01:36:27.011
He's exceptionally well, sir.
Though he's a bit upset today.

01:36:27.089 --> 01:36:30.024
He imagined she'd be buried
in a Catholic way.

01:36:30.092 --> 01:36:32.356
And why would he think that?

01:36:32.428 --> 01:36:35.192
Young boys, sir,
they get these ideas.

01:36:35.264 --> 01:36:38.722
Though I have to admit,
even I can't explain it.

01:36:38.801 --> 01:36:41.463
Explain what?

01:36:41.537 --> 01:36:46.304
On the day of her assignation,
she walked him to a tube.

01:36:46.375 --> 01:36:50.675
She thought he was lost, gave him
a coin and kissed him on his cheek.

01:36:50.746 --> 01:36:52.805
On his afflicted cheek, sir.

01:36:52.881 --> 01:36:54.872
And over the weeks
that followed...

01:36:54.950 --> 01:36:57.475
his affliction gradually went away.

01:36:57.553 --> 01:37:00.886
I tried to keep him rational,
but he swears it was because of her.

01:37:03.025 --> 01:37:05.459
Say hello to Mr. Bendrix, Lance.

01:37:24.012 --> 01:37:25.843
Hello, sir.

01:37:37.593 --> 01:37:41.723
I wrote at the start
that this was a diary of hate.

01:37:41.797 --> 01:37:44.994
I hated You as though You existed.

01:37:45.067 --> 01:37:47.968
Now I am tired of hating...

01:37:48.036 --> 01:37:50.027
but You're still there.

01:37:50.105 --> 01:37:54.132
So Your cunning is infinite.

01:37:54.209 --> 01:37:57.235
You used my hate to win
my acknowledgement.

01:37:57.312 --> 01:37:58.711
Thank you, Henry.

01:37:58.781 --> 01:38:00.908
And I've only one prayer left.

01:38:02.451 --> 01:38:05.318
Dear God, forget about me.

01:38:06.388 --> 01:38:09.949
Look after her and Henry.

01:38:10.305 --> 01:38:16.496
