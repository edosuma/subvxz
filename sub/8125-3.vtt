Uh-huh.

01:23.916 --> 01:26.151
Mmm. Beats eating 'em
out of jars.

01:26.218 --> 01:29.654
I used to have an Uncle
who'd put an olive on
every finger of his hand.

01:29.722 --> 01:31.990
Know what they used to
call him ?
Uh-uh.

01:32.058 --> 01:33.992
Vincent.

01:35.294 --> 01:39.230
Why'd they call him
Vincent ?
That was his name.

01:39.298 --> 01:42.333
Then why'd you tell me
the thing about the--

01:42.401 --> 01:44.002
Michael !

01:44.070 --> 01:47.005

Olive fingers ?

[ Moans ]

01:55.347 --> 01:57.782

What time's himself
comin' home ?

01:57.850 --> 01:59.784
I'm not sure.

01:59.852 --> 02:02.787
You know he moonlights
with Mr. munson's taxicab
on Saturdays.

02:02.855 --> 02:04.789
Hey, mom,
when's daddy coming home ?

02:04.857 --> 02:08.059
Well, in his own words,
when he's g-d ready.

02:09.428 --> 02:12.864
Myself, something tells me
any second now.

02:12.932 --> 02:16.367
Isn't that sweet, Michael ?
She feels it in her heart.

02:16.435 --> 02:18.870
No, I hear it
at the door.

02:20.172 --> 02:22.607
[ Gloria ]
Hiya, daddy.
[ Mike ] Hi, arch.

02:22.674 --> 02:24.943
What's the matter
with you ?
Nothin'.

02:25.010 --> 02:26.945
No hello ?
Even they said hello.

02:27.012 --> 02:30.115
They said "hi."
But you said
nothin'.

02:30.182 --> 02:33.118
I was gonna say good evening.
Oh, skip it, will ya.
Skip it.

02:33.185 --> 02:36.855
I've learned to expect
nothin' but aggravation
from you anyhow.

02:36.922 --> 02:39.858
Um, it's almost 7:00, daddy.
You're late.

02:39.925 --> 02:42.861
He's always late,
except after coffee
in the morning.

02:42.928 --> 02:45.864
Six minutes later,
to the second, watch out.

02:45.931 --> 02:48.867
And God forbid
I'm in there shaving.

02:48.934 --> 02:53.138
The workin's of nature won't
wait for no deadbeat who
takes all morning to shave.

02:53.205 --> 02:55.140
Remember that.

02:55.207 --> 02:57.642
I'm not knockin' it.
I think you're a marvel.

02:57.709 --> 03:01.379
I can even set my watch
by how long it takes you
to belch after a bicarb.

03:02.447 --> 03:04.382
Twenty-two seconds,
exactly.

03:05.450 --> 03:07.385
Well, listen, wise guy,

03:07.452 --> 03:09.888
you should have
such a constitution.

03:09.955 --> 03:13.691
They'd have counted you out
already if you'd been in
the accident I was just in.

03:13.759 --> 03:16.694
Archie, an accident ?
Daddy,
are you all right ?

03:16.762 --> 03:20.131
No, no, no,
they couldn't hurt me.
What happened ?

03:20.199 --> 03:23.634
Well, there was this pushy dame.
You know the kind-- a yenta.

03:23.702 --> 03:26.137
Plows into
the back of my cab.

03:26.205 --> 03:28.807
And I mean plowed.
Wham !

03:28.874 --> 03:32.944
Them people are always in
a hurry, trying to get to a sale
or somethin' to save four cents.

03:33.012 --> 03:34.946
What a tribe.

03:35.014 --> 03:37.949
What do you mean,
"what a tribe" ?
Forget it, Michael.

03:38.017 --> 03:40.952
Come on, mom.
I'll help you
with dinner.

03:41.020 --> 03:44.289
I'm glad you weren't hurt.
What do you mean,
"what a tribe" ?

03:44.356 --> 03:46.291
Forget it.
It's "irrevelant."

03:46.358 --> 03:48.592
Irrelevant.
Whatever.

03:48.660 --> 03:51.129
It ain't German
to the conversation.

03:55.500 --> 03:57.435
Germane.
Aw, listen,
Emily post.

03:57.502 --> 03:59.938
If you correct me
one more time--
okay, okay.

04:03.775 --> 04:06.711
But you didn't mean
to call me Emily post.
Oh, jeez.

04:06.778 --> 04:11.216
She's an expert on table
manners, wedding invitations,
things like that.

04:11.283 --> 04:13.218
It's the wrong image,
arch.

04:13.285 --> 04:17.221
What you meant to call me was,
say, Mr. funk or Mr. wagnall,
the dictionary people.

04:17.289 --> 04:20.624
'Cause I was
correcting you on words.
You see the difference there ?

04:20.692 --> 04:22.626
You are defective.

04:22.694 --> 04:24.628
There's no doubt
about it.

04:25.697 --> 04:27.631
You got a fuse blown
in your head...

04:27.699 --> 04:30.335
Somewhere between the brain
and the nervous system.

04:30.402 --> 04:33.338
There ain't
a store in the country
that wouldn't take you back.

04:34.473 --> 04:36.741
Why don't you
clean your fingernails ?

04:37.877 --> 04:40.578
Maybe things
wouldn't grow there.

04:40.645 --> 04:42.580
Hey, Edith,
where's supper, huh ?

04:42.647 --> 04:44.582
All set, Archie.

04:44.649 --> 04:47.585
I was just givin' you a chance
to work up an appetite.

04:47.652 --> 04:50.588
He always eats better
when he's upset.

04:50.655 --> 04:53.091
Well, I eat better
when he's not upset.

04:53.158 --> 04:57.395
So, just this once,
could we have a meal without
an argument ? Michael ?

04:57.462 --> 05:00.965
[ Imitating James cagney ]
You want it ?
You got it, baby.

05:01.033 --> 05:03.334
Oh, we're gonna have
a floor show, huh ?

05:03.402 --> 05:05.336
Come on, daddy.

05:05.404 --> 05:07.605
No arguments, okay ?
Who's arguing ?

05:07.672 --> 05:10.108
I don't think
that's an answer.

05:10.175 --> 05:14.212
Oh, this dingbat's gonna
start argument number one
over here.

05:14.280 --> 05:17.415

could you settle down ?
Now, let's just eat.

Mom, anything interesting
happen to you today ?

07:04.356 --> 07:07.892
Actually,
something interesting
did happen today.

07:09.661 --> 07:11.829
Oh, no,
that was yesterday.

07:16.468 --> 07:19.970
Well, I can't eat
no more of this.
What's the matter, daddy ?

07:20.039 --> 07:22.473
It's the meat.
It's not done enough.

07:22.541 --> 07:25.976
You knew that all the time ?
I made it medium
just this once.

07:26.045 --> 07:28.979
I don't like it medium.
I like it well.

07:29.048 --> 07:30.981
<i>Well</i> well.

07:31.050 --> 07:33.984

it spoils the flavor.

Ain't that the dame who
don't even like to cook ?

07:39.024 --> 07:41.292
<i>Yeah,</i>
<i>but she's an expert.</i>

07:41.360 --> 07:44.362
And she says well
spoils the flavor.

07:44.430 --> 07:47.365
It seals it in,
that's what it does.

07:47.433 --> 07:50.568
Any gourmet will tell you,
the only way to eat meat
is rare.

07:50.635 --> 07:53.904
Oh, now we hear
from the Polish corner.

07:53.972 --> 07:58.242
Poland, the land
that gave us such rare
and delicate dishes as--

07:59.344 --> 08:02.046
uh, Polish sausage
is very good.

08:02.114 --> 08:04.848
You oughta know.
You married one.

08:06.518 --> 08:09.019
I'm sick and tired
of your Polish jokes.

08:09.088 --> 08:12.022
You see, mom ?
It's winding up
in an argument after all.

08:12.091 --> 08:15.025
No, it ain't, 'cause
I'm gonna take my dessert
over here in my chair.

08:15.094 --> 08:17.027

rice puddin' ?

08:17.096 --> 08:19.564

08:26.305 --> 08:28.739
sometimes two
and three times a week,

08:28.807 --> 08:31.175

the same thing.

"Give it to me
with a little pinch
of milk on top."

08:34.246 --> 08:37.681
Except last week, remember ?
Mike and Gloria
went out to dinner.

08:37.749 --> 08:40.017
You made rice puddin',
and what happened ?

08:40.085 --> 08:43.020
You didn't
make your usual speech
about the milk on top.

08:43.087 --> 08:45.022
I remember.

08:45.090 --> 08:48.259
- And how did you serve it ?
- Without the milk on top.

08:48.327 --> 08:49.827

ask for it.

Hey, Archie,
you never finished the story
about the accident.

08:59.171 --> 09:02.106

very simply, that...

Here's your rice pudding.

on top.

all the same, them people ?"
What people ?

The chosen people.
What do I gotta do,

09:28.467 --> 09:30.901
She plows into
the back of my cab,

09:30.969 --> 09:33.904
then she opens up her yap
as though it was me
that hit her.

all the way to Tel Aviv.

Look out.

12:52.237 --> 12:54.171
Ooh, Edith !
Ohh !
Oh, Archie !

12:54.239 --> 12:58.609
Do you think
it's from the accident ?
Maybe you got a whiplash.

12:58.677 --> 13:00.845
Nah.
Not from a little dent.

13:00.912 --> 13:03.347
Shut up, meathead.

13:03.415 --> 13:05.549
Edith, help me
to the chair, will ya.

13:05.617 --> 13:08.051
You, keep away from me.

13:08.119 --> 13:11.489
[ Groans ]
Oh. Oh, gee, Edith.

13:11.556 --> 13:13.491
Oh !

13:13.558 --> 13:17.261
Uh, wh-what was that you said
about, uh... whiplash ?

13:26.838 --> 13:28.773
What are you doin',
Edith ?

13:28.840 --> 13:32.276
The <i>reader's digest</i> says
you should put a pillow
under your legs...

13:32.343 --> 13:34.278
If you hurt your back.

13:34.345 --> 13:37.782
- Don't believe what you read
in them articles.
- It wasn't in an article.

13:37.849 --> 13:40.785
It was at the bottom
of a page.

13:40.852 --> 13:44.221
You know,
where the article was finished
and they still had some space.

13:44.289 --> 13:46.724
I don't wanna hear
about the articles !

13:46.792 --> 13:50.728
I don't read the articles.
Just the bottom
of the pages.

13:50.796 --> 13:54.398
Do they tell you,
at the bottom of the pages,
how to bury your husband ?

13:54.466 --> 13:58.068
Oh, Archie,
don't talk like that.

13:58.136 --> 14:01.605
How could you be dying ?
You ain't seen a doctor yet.

14:01.673 --> 14:03.607
Yeah, what about
a doctor, daddy ?

14:03.675 --> 14:07.377
We'll see a lawyer first.
He'll tell us
what doctor to go to.

14:07.446 --> 14:09.680
They got specialists
for all these things.

14:09.748 --> 14:12.483
What about Fred kowalcyzk,
my brother-in-law ?
He's a lawyer.

14:12.551 --> 14:14.985
Kowalcyzk.
No, that don't sound good.

14:16.387 --> 14:19.156
We could call
Helen gurney's
brother Peter.

14:19.223 --> 14:22.159
He handles accidents.
Peter gurney ?
No, no, no.

14:22.226 --> 14:24.829
Listen, get me
the yellow pages.

14:24.896 --> 14:28.098
Why not somebody you know ?
Why a stranger ?

14:28.166 --> 14:30.468
Because sometimes
strangers is best.

14:30.535 --> 14:33.471
They don't get
too close to you.
You know what I mean.

14:33.538 --> 14:36.774
No.
Will you get me
the yellow pages !

14:36.842 --> 14:39.477
Do you know
what he means, ma ?
No.

14:39.544 --> 14:42.245
Cut that out, Edith !

14:42.313 --> 14:44.247
Let's see here.

14:44.315 --> 14:46.917
There's, like, ten pages
of lawyers here.

14:46.985 --> 14:48.919
Where should I start,
at the beginning ?

14:48.987 --> 14:53.090
No, start at the middle
and read out sideways.

14:53.157 --> 14:55.325
Certainly,
start at the beginning.

14:55.393 --> 14:58.328
There's 10,000 names here.
I'll skip around.
It'll be faster.

14:59.464 --> 15:01.398
All right, let's see.

15:01.466 --> 15:05.803
Uh, "w.B. Adams.
Adams and brenner.
Burton and fitzallen.

15:05.871 --> 15:07.805

15:07.873 --> 15:09.807
Cohen and Ginsberg.
What ?

15:09.875 --> 15:12.810
Cohen--
just go on readin'.
Go on, go on.

15:12.878 --> 15:16.146
Okay, uh,
"Evans and monahan.
Franklin and Powell.

15:16.214 --> 15:18.148
Lochman, shapiro

15:18.216 --> 15:20.317

15:20.385 --> 15:23.186
- What ?
- I'm just thinkin'.
Will you read on !

15:23.254 --> 15:25.556
All right.
"Harris and whipple.

15:25.624 --> 15:29.059
"Johnson and Smith.
McDonald and shelby.

15:31.496 --> 15:33.664
rabinowitz, rabinowitz--

15:33.732 --> 15:35.666
what was the third name ?

15:38.570 --> 15:40.504
Rabinowitz.

15:40.572 --> 15:43.440
Yeah. How do they
sound to you ?

15:43.508 --> 15:45.242
Jewish.

15:46.344 --> 15:47.945
Very Jewish.

15:48.013 --> 15:51.214
What has their religion
got to do with it ?
That's what we wanna know.

15:51.282 --> 15:55.553
Listen, Mr. big liberal,
you brought up
their religion, not me.

15:55.620 --> 15:59.189
If they're good lawyers,
for all I care
they could be chinks.

16:00.358 --> 16:02.292
Do you
believe him ?

16:02.360 --> 16:05.796
He actually thinks
because they're Jewish
they're smarter, shrewder.

16:05.864 --> 16:07.798
Well ?
You actually
believe that junk ?

16:07.866 --> 16:09.800
Listen to this guy,
Edith.

16:09.868 --> 16:12.302
I agree with him that
they're smarter and shrewder,

16:12.370 --> 16:14.805
he's makin' out like
I don't like the hebes.

16:14.873 --> 16:17.808
Now, daddy, you stop
twisting things around
like that.

16:17.876 --> 16:21.311
You don't trust anybody
that's different from you,
until you need him.

16:21.379 --> 16:23.313
Well, I <i>do</i> need him !

16:23.381 --> 16:25.816
Oh, jeez !
Mom, he's so
prejudiced.

16:25.884 --> 16:27.818
What are we
gonna do ?

16:30.188 --> 16:32.289
Get him a rabinowitz.

16:37.195 --> 16:39.129
Archie,
I brought you some juice.

16:39.197 --> 16:41.131
It'll help
wash down the pills.

16:41.199 --> 16:44.134
Are you all right ?
Can I get you
anything more ?

16:44.202 --> 16:47.638
No, Edith,
just pick up some of
the papers around here.

16:47.706 --> 16:51.141
And ask your son-in-law to
sit up like a human being.

16:51.209 --> 16:55.145
And, Gloria, you get up
and straighten out some of
the pictures on the walls.

He'll be here any minute.
You want people to think
you live in a pig's eye ?

17:00.619 --> 17:03.553
You didn't make
this much fuss last year...

17:03.622 --> 17:06.056
When your own mother
came to visit.

17:06.124 --> 17:08.558
His own mother
wasn't a Jewish lawyer.

17:09.894 --> 17:12.329
I don't think she even
went to high school.

17:12.396 --> 17:14.330
All right, Edith.

17:16.567 --> 17:19.502
Did she, Archie ?
Did your mother
go to high school ?

out this way before.

and sometimes faltering
counselor-at-law.

As a matter of fact,
it was your rather eloquent
appeal to my secretary...

our upper and lower back
are in spasm...

is quite severe.

to our witnesses--

You said nothing to me
about witnesses, Mr. bunker.

23:14.359 --> 23:18.195
- The kids, the kids. You know.
- Oh, yes, the little children
in the playground.

coming out of the parking lot
when it happened.

Now, do you recall
in what direction
you were traveling ?

23:45.423 --> 23:49.092
Uh, his vehicle was,
uh, headed north,
I believe.

23:49.160 --> 23:51.661
Yes, but he was
traveling South.

23:53.697 --> 23:56.633
Well, I was backin' up.
Now, what difference
could that make ?

23:56.700 --> 24:00.904

you were going the wrong way
in a one-way alley.
