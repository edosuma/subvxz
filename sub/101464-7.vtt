[Darius panting]

01:16.910 --> 01:19.329
We have to move. The only way

I'm fine.

I've competed with a torn ACL.

about Ben and Bumpy.

01:29.964 --> 01:31.633
[Ben panting]

01:31.716 --> 01:34.969
What we should all be worried about
is catching a boat out of here

01:35.053 --> 01:37.514
and, naturally, we have a problem.

01:38.014 --> 01:39.265
We're here.

The docks are on the southern tip

Even if we ran at peak Yaz speed,

01:44.020 --> 01:45.897
there's no way we'd make
the last boat out.

01:45.980 --> 01:47.315

01:47.398 --> 01:48.316
[scoffs] Yes, I do.

Okay, so we need another way.

01:56.282 --> 01:57.283
Um...

01:58.868 --> 01:59.744
Can we use those somehow?

01:59.828 --> 02:02.038
Or send someone to tell the ferry people
to wait?

02:02.122 --> 02:04.332

-Or make a few jetpacks real quick?

Ben, someone stole your candy bars
and put dirt in 'em.

09:49.505 --> 09:52.258
They're carob bars.
They pair perfectly with--

09:52.341 --> 09:53.676
Carob juice.

09:53.926 --> 09:54.844
Awesome.

09:55.094 --> 09:57.138
Carob is nature's chocolate.

09:57.221 --> 10:00.474
Just as delicious, with none of the sugar
or caffeine.

10:01.392 --> 10:03.936
What's wrong with sugar and caffeine?

10:04.020 --> 10:08.274
First thing I'm gonna do when I get home
is hug my espresso machine.

10:08.774 --> 10:10.276

Once my ankle's better,
it's back to training.

a new corporate sponsor,

10:29.545 --> 10:32.089

10:32.173 --> 10:33.174

How about you? What's the first thing
you'll do when you get home?

10:42.224 --> 10:44.602
Depends on which wing of our mansion
you're talkin' about.

10:44.685 --> 10:48.272
East wing is usually off limits,
but Dad and Candy are away on business,

10:48.356 --> 10:52.735

to our bowling alley. [chuckles]

for days!

How much stuff can you fit in that thing?

11:16.467 --> 11:18.761
One, lots, and two,

11:18.844 --> 11:22.556

when I get back is restock it.

impending doom!

it was gonna be.

13:11.832 --> 13:13.751
But after everything we went through,

13:13.834 --> 13:16.754
at least we're leavin' this place
with five new friends!

13:35.564 --> 13:37.733
I mean... [sighs]

13:37.816 --> 13:40.319
Doesn't it usually take
more than a few days

13:40.402 --> 13:42.363
to become friends with someone?

13:42.571 --> 13:44.198
We were thrown together at random.

13:44.323 --> 13:46.200
We have nothing in common.

13:47.952 --> 13:49.036
That's not true!

13:49.119 --> 13:52.665
We've been through more together
than most friends have in a lifetime.

13:52.748 --> 13:57.586
And now that it's over, what are the odds
that we'll ever see each other again?

14:12.768 --> 14:15.104
[chuckles] What does that even mean?

14:15.854 --> 14:17.231
I thought I knew.

14:18.649 --> 14:22.653
My whole life, I had this idea
of Jurassic World.

14:23.946 --> 14:28.450
My dad used to say this place was,
"All-osaurus and a bag of chips."

14:31.120 --> 14:32.580
He was so corny.

14:33.455 --> 14:35.291
Um, was?

14:36.000 --> 14:37.459
So, your dad is...

14:48.220 --> 14:49.597
I'm sorry, Darius.

14:49.680 --> 14:53.475
Ugh! "Sorry." Nice one,
Sammy, ya ding-dong!

14:53.559 --> 14:56.186
-Like "sorry" could begin to--
-It's okay.

14:58.314 --> 15:00.983
Hey, at least your dad never saw

15:01.066 --> 15:04.111
what a dumpster fire this place turned out
to be, huh?

15:04.194 --> 15:05.779
Ow! What?

15:05.863 --> 15:09.533
I meant it's cool that Darius and his dad
were so close.

15:09.617 --> 15:10.868
I could count on one hand

15:10.951 --> 15:14.246
the number of times me and my dad
have done... anything.

15:14.330 --> 15:16.707
Kenji, that's just real sad.

15:17.207 --> 15:18.208
Yeah.

15:19.627 --> 15:21.754
Did I mention I have a bowling alley?

15:22.838 --> 15:23.839
[Ben] Dang it!

15:23.923 --> 15:26.675
Come on, it's gotta be here somewhere.
Oh! [scoffs]

15:26.759 --> 15:30.095
Bumpy stepped in something icky
and I'm low on sanitizer.

15:30.179 --> 15:31.847
It's fine. I can make more.

15:31.931 --> 15:33.682
Ben, why are you here?

15:34.141 --> 15:38.604
What he means is--
Eh, well, you're scared of dinosaurs,

15:38.687 --> 15:42.232
and the outdoors,
and sometimes the indoors, and germs.

15:42.316 --> 15:44.026
Whipped cream for some reason?

15:44.109 --> 15:47.029
The way it moves. [shudders]

15:47.363 --> 15:50.074
Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.
What's the deal?

15:50.157 --> 15:51.283
[Bumpy squeals]

15:51.367 --> 15:54.370
My mom works for Mr. Masrani.
She got me into camp.

15:54.453 --> 15:58.999
Said it would be a great way for me
to "face my fears." It's been a nightmare!

15:59.083 --> 16:01.585
I'm sick of being scared all the time.

16:01.669 --> 16:04.546
And of running,
and of almost getting eaten,

16:04.630 --> 16:08.092
and... and of holding everyone back.

16:08.258 --> 16:11.971
I just can't do... this.

16:17.559 --> 16:19.728
[Bumpy groans]

16:19.812 --> 16:22.147
[Ben] But it's not all bad.

16:22.773 --> 16:24.733
If I hadn't come,
I-- I never would have met--

16:58.767 --> 17:01.895
-[gasps]
-[screeches]

17:04.940 --> 17:06.483
Flying reptiles are basically seabirds.

17:06.567 --> 17:08.318
They're attracted to shiny,
moving objects,

17:08.527 --> 17:11.780
-and with all these lights on--
-We're a shiny, moving object!

17:11.864 --> 17:12.906
[screeches]

17:13.198 --> 17:14.074
[screams]

17:14.158 --> 17:16.952
[Kenji panting]

17:17.578 --> 17:18.704
What should I do?

17:18.787 --> 17:21.290
-Just keep out of the way!
-[smashing continues]

17:31.967 --> 17:34.887

17:58.368 --> 18:00.079
Sammy, help Ben and Bumpy across!

18:01.497 --> 18:03.624
[Yasmina pants] Whoa!

18:05.667 --> 18:06.794

-[grunting, groaning]

18:35.906 --> 18:37.157
[gasps]

18:48.210 --> 18:50.504
At least now we know
what that boom was earlier.

18:50.796 --> 18:52.339
-I told you--
-[Brooklynn] Don't.

18:52.464 --> 18:54.842
If we don't switch tracks
or stop this car right now,

18:54.925 --> 18:57.094
we're gonna hit that thing, full speed!

18:57.261 --> 18:59.263
The front car,
there's control panels there!

18:59.346 --> 19:01.265
VIP Tour, I was eight, they let me drive.

19:02.558 --> 19:04.726

19:16.697 --> 19:18.240
I'm gonna get to the control car
through there.

19:18.323 --> 19:20.701
-You're gonna what?
-You can't go out there!

19:20.784 --> 19:22.703
[sputters] That's where
the flying whatevers are!

19:22.870 --> 19:24.746
We don't have a choice! Me and--

19:29.668 --> 19:31.712

19:40.971 --> 19:42.639
You're gonna be okay.

19:43.515 --> 19:46.185
Distract the flock while I crawl over
the top to the control car.
