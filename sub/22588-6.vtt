And now,
my anonymous nemesis

03:22.886 --> 03:27.715
let's see who you are
behind that mask of yours.

03:36.444 --> 03:38.075
Oho! A twist!

03:38.077 --> 03:40.439
Fight water with fire.

03:46.171 --> 03:49.166
The Joker,
he's getting away!

03:50.134 --> 03:52.164
I'll get him.

04:06.223 --> 04:07.121
You're trapped, Joker.

04:07.123 --> 04:11.884
As a duly deputized agent of the
law...I order you to surrender.

04:11.886 --> 04:16.281
As the Clown Prince
of Crime, I decline.

04:18.115 --> 04:21.278
I hope this doesn't depress you.

04:46.829 --> 04:49.659
It's time for you
to sing a different tune

04:49.661 --> 04:50.857
my crooked clown.

04:50.859 --> 04:54.188
Songs are for parties,
my caped copper.

04:58.655 --> 05:00.284
And so is confetti.

05:02.218 --> 05:05.014
So why don't you join the fun?

05:06.149 --> 05:09.378
I'm sorry you can't join me,
my helpless hero

05:09.380 --> 05:12.975
but I see you're
tied up with other things.

05:18.673 --> 05:21.437
Batman! Batman!

05:21.639 --> 05:23.735
Holy serpentine!
What happened?

05:23.737 --> 05:27.632
This time...The Joker
gave the party.

05:31.432 --> 05:34.261
Next time we'll
hand out the door prizes.

05:34.263 --> 05:38.358
<i> Have Batman and Boy Wonder</i>
<i> finally met their match?</i>

05:38.360 --> 05:43.521
<i> Will The Joker's utility belt</i>

06:03.444 --> 06:05.973
These are the questions
all Gotham City

06:05.975 --> 06:06.939
is asking itself tonight.

06:06.941 --> 06:09.670
Have Batman and Boy Wonder
finally met their match?

06:09.672 --> 06:13.168
Will The Joker's utility belt
prove their ultimate undoing?

06:13.170 --> 06:14.734
In a filmed interview
at his office today

06:14.736 --> 06:18.531
'Police Commissioner Gordon
had answers to these questions.'

06:18.533 --> 06:22.129
'Commissioner Gordon,
have Batman and Boy Wonder'

06:22.131 --> 06:23.628
finally met their match?

06:23.630 --> 06:28.258
Well, let me say this, Fred,
I...I'd hate to think so.

06:28.259 --> 06:29.990
Do you think
The Joker's utility belt

06:29.992 --> 06:32.487
will prove their
ultimate undoing?

06:32.489 --> 06:35.319
Heaven help us all if it does.

06:35.321 --> 06:36.618
Uh, amen.

06:37.820 --> 06:41.448
'Thus Commissioner Gordon
and Chief O'Hara'

06:41.450 --> 06:43.748
echo the sentiments
of all Gotham City.

06:43.750 --> 06:46.246
For even as that
interview is being filmed

06:46.248 --> 06:47.578
criminals of every kind

06:47.680 --> 06:50.943
emboldened by the Dynamic Duo's
seeming impotence

06:50.945 --> 06:52.475
'were combining
to create a crime wave'

06:52.477 --> 06:56.173
'the likes of which
Gotham City has seldom seen.'

06:56.241 --> 06:58.036
In this hour of peril and need

06:58.038 --> 07:00.469
perhaps all our prayers
are best summed up

07:00.471 --> 07:04.633
by my small son Harold,
just eight years old.

07:04.635 --> 07:06.232
Kneeling beside his little bed

07:06.234 --> 07:09.096
hands clasped
reverently before him

07:09.098 --> 07:11.094
he said, "God bless mommy.

07:11.096 --> 07:14.226
"God bless daddy.
God bless my dog Spot.

07:14.228 --> 07:19.089
"And please, Batman, whoever you
are behind that mask of yours

07:19.091 --> 07:21.154
please save us."

07:21.156 --> 07:23.818
Turn it off, Alfred.

07:24.122 --> 07:25.785
Wait a minute.

07:29.650 --> 07:32.913
'Hold that camera still.'

07:33.415 --> 07:35.977
How do you focus this thing?

07:44.274 --> 07:46.836
No hard feelings, Freddie.

07:54.734 --> 07:57.263
Places, everyone. Ha ha ha.

07:57.665 --> 08:01.127
- Let's race to the studio.
- No time for that now. Look.

08:01.129 --> 08:03.592
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.

08:03.594 --> 08:06.623
And welcome to
"What's My Crime."

08:08.491 --> 08:11.054
It seems that your
inept Dynamic Duo

08:11.056 --> 08:13.552
is having a little
difficulty in figuring out

08:13.554 --> 08:15.417
'just what my
next crime will be.'

08:15.819 --> 08:19.947
So I thought it only fair,
under the circumstances

08:19.949 --> 08:23.012
to give them a little hint.
Ha ha ha.

08:23.014 --> 08:27.675
Are you listening out there,
Fatman and Boy Blunder? Ha ha.

08:27.677 --> 08:30.440
Boy! How I'd like to
top him with a punch line.

08:30.442 --> 08:35.104
Quiet. Listen. His insane
conceit may betray him.

08:35.106 --> 08:36.736
Are your masks in place, panel?

08:36.738 --> 08:39.366
- 'Oh, yes.'
- Very well then.

08:39.369 --> 08:40.833
Let the game commence.

08:40.836 --> 08:45.264
Does this crime involve
an article of clothing?

08:45.266 --> 08:46.030
Right!

08:46.032 --> 08:46.861
Like a belt maybe?

08:46.863 --> 08:49.228
Astonishing!
Right again.

08:49.330 --> 08:53.525
It involves a belt, but there's
going to be a switch.

08:53.527 --> 08:56.356
- A switch.
- An electric switch?

08:56.358 --> 08:57.655
Wrong, panel!

08:59.522 --> 09:01.452
A switch, but not electric.

09:01.454 --> 09:03.918
As you doubtless know,
every wrong answer

09:03.920 --> 09:05.716
means that we
contribute one dollar

09:05.718 --> 09:09.647
'to the famous Joker's Home
For Worn Out Bats.'

09:09.649 --> 09:11.345
- Ha ha ha.
- Hey, Joker.

09:11.347 --> 09:12.511
Cop cars on the street.

09:12.513 --> 09:14.877
Let's chase it.

09:14.879 --> 09:17.909
Fatman and Boy Blunder..

09:17.911 --> 09:20.539
...are your blindfolds in place?

09:20.541 --> 09:22.871
Very well then, ask yourselves

09:22.873 --> 09:26.369
what is wrong
with this sentence?

09:26.371 --> 09:30.633
He who laughs last, laughs good.

09:34.632 --> 09:36.363
Holy grammar! Is that all?

09:36.365 --> 09:40.926
He who laughs last,
laughs best, not good.

09:40.928 --> 09:42.258
Best. Best! Best!

09:42.260 --> 09:45.822
Do you suppose blindfold might
have something to do with it?

09:45.824 --> 09:47.621
Uh, if I may
venture an opinion, sir

09:47.623 --> 09:51.252
I think Master Dick may
have put his finger on it.

09:51.254 --> 09:54.183
- Blindfold?
- Uh, no, sir. Grammar.

09:54.185 --> 09:56.581
The sentence was
grammatically incorrect.

09:56.583 --> 09:59.146
One does not
laugh good, sir.

09:59.148 --> 10:00.712
One laughs well.

10:00.714 --> 10:02.511
Why, that's it, Alfred.

10:02.513 --> 10:05.176
Laughs well. Laughwell.

10:05.178 --> 10:08.607
- Professor James J. Laughwell.
- Holy safari!

10:09.209 --> 10:12.404
The one that just got back
from Africa with a collection

10:12.406 --> 10:14.436
of rare masks
and objects of art.

10:14.438 --> 10:16.800
That's where the blindfold
part would come in, sir.

10:16.802 --> 10:20.631
And they're being stored
at the Last Longer Warehouse.

10:20.633 --> 10:22.197
To the Batmobile.

10:53.877 --> 10:58.739
We'll use the Bat-rope and take
them by surprise. Stand clear.

11:20.093 --> 11:23.322
No matter what, we mustn't
fail this time, Robin.

11:23.324 --> 11:26.220
Sometimes I think people
expect too much of us, Batman.

11:26.222 --> 11:27.551
They have a right
to expect it.

11:27.553 --> 11:29.351
But we're only human.

11:29.353 --> 11:30.283
All too true.

11:30.285 --> 11:32.116
We only have so much to give.

11:32.118 --> 11:33.814
Try to explain
that to little Harold

11:33.816 --> 11:37.879
kneeling beside his bed
saying his prayers.

12:04.995 --> 12:07.158
Stand and fight, Joker.

12:42.669 --> 12:46.365
Let us away! Let us away!

13:25.307 --> 13:28.369
Holy Fourth of July!
What's this?

13:31.236 --> 13:33.965
'This was just
the curtain-raiser.'

13:33.968 --> 13:38.297
'Next time you'll get
the real showstopper.'

13:44.494 --> 13:46.822
That's not your belt.

13:46.824 --> 13:51.920
No. It's a clever replica
of The Joker's utility belt.

13:51.922 --> 13:54.684
He must've slipped it
on me during the struggle.

13:54.686 --> 13:56.483
Then when you thought
you were stopping him

13:56.485 --> 14:01.214
with your utility belt, he was
really stopping us with his!

14:01.216 --> 14:03.511
That tricky devil!

14:03.513 --> 14:06.643
He's hit us below the belt!

14:06.645 --> 14:07.210
Golly.

14:07.212 --> 14:11.374
What do you suppose little
Harold's going to think now?

14:16.172 --> 14:18.801
<i> "Crime wave grows!"</i>

14:19.768 --> 14:22.365
<i> "Police powerless!"</i>

14:22.500 --> 14:26.229
<i> "Batman and Robin</i>
<i> foiled again!"</i>

14:26.764 --> 14:29.593
<i> "The Joker is wild!"</i>

14:30.262 --> 14:32.857
'All the same.'

14:34.292 --> 14:35.755
"The Joker is wild!"

14:35.757 --> 14:38.888
"Batman and Robin
foiled again!"

14:38.890 --> 14:42.218
Holy headlines! We look
like page one dumbbells!

14:42.220 --> 14:44.415
Too true, Robin,
the responsibility of the press

14:44.417 --> 14:48.646
is to report the truth despite
what it might do to our image.

14:48.648 --> 14:52.611
Our main concern
is to a frightened public

14:52.613 --> 14:55.176
whom we seem to be failing.

14:55.178 --> 14:56.242
Gosh, you're right.

14:56.244 --> 15:00.305
I can't help thinking
of only myself. I'm sorry.

15:00.307 --> 15:01.570
Well, it's okay,
chum, we all

15:01.572 --> 15:04.870
have the right
to be selfish sometimes.

15:05.604 --> 15:07.867
- Nothing?
- Not so far.

15:07.869 --> 15:12.231
But we do know that giggling
thief's about to pounce again.

15:12.233 --> 15:14.762
What was it that he
said in the warehouse?

15:14.764 --> 15:18.526
"Next time you'll get
the <i> real</i> showstopper."

15:18.528 --> 15:21.457
Exactly! Showstopper.

15:21.459 --> 15:23.190
Show.

15:23.192 --> 15:24.489
Another telecast.

15:24.491 --> 15:26.255
I think you're
off the beam, Robin.

15:26.257 --> 15:28.120
The Joker's too shrewd
a customer

15:28.122 --> 15:30.751
to hurl such an obvious clue.

15:30.753 --> 15:31.550
Of course.

15:31.552 --> 15:32.850
But I can't help thinking

15:32.852 --> 15:35.681
he slipped up somewhere.

15:36.150 --> 15:37.547
Perhaps he's about to.

15:37.549 --> 15:40.678
- What do you mean?
- Look at it this way, Robin.

15:40.680 --> 15:42.243
He's terrorized Gotham City

15:42.245 --> 15:43.676
he's baffled
the police department

15:43.678 --> 15:45.707
and he's held us
up to public ridicule.

15:45.709 --> 15:49.771
- True.
- Gloating on his own success.

15:49.773 --> 15:53.236
He may be planning
some super crime

15:53.238 --> 15:56.433
and stumble
on his own pride.

15:56.435 --> 15:59.631
How do we go
about stopping him?

15:59.633 --> 16:02.429
Just go about
our normal routine..

16:02.431 --> 16:06.626
...and let the venomous
viper trap himself.

16:06.628 --> 16:09.225
And when he does..

16:09.360 --> 16:10.391
Snap!

16:10.393 --> 16:13.322
- Caught in a Bat-trap!
- Right.

16:16.255 --> 16:18.518
What is it, chum?

16:18.520 --> 16:21.416
Oh, the...
the launch tomorrow.

16:21.418 --> 16:22.316
What about it?

16:22.318 --> 16:24.181
I dread facing
all those people.

16:24.183 --> 16:26.313
We can't disappoint
Commissioner Gordon

16:26.315 --> 16:30.477
and we have to make an
appearance to snare that devil.

16:30.479 --> 16:31.409
I see what you mean.

16:31.411 --> 16:36.074
I just wish I knew what
The Joker is plotting right now!

16:36.076 --> 16:39.471
A scheme to trap
that grinning devil.

16:39.473 --> 16:44.534
Meantime let's get back
to the utility belt he planted.

16:55.728 --> 16:57.258
Everything's set.

16:57.260 --> 16:58.524
The plan is perfect.

16:59.326 --> 17:01.523
Jeez, it'll be like
a dream come true.

17:01.525 --> 17:06.252
Cruising the world in our own
private luxury ocean yacht.

17:06.255 --> 17:08.518
Are you sure Batman
won't get in our way?

17:08.520 --> 17:10.982
That's right, Joker,
we may got him down

17:10.983 --> 17:12.381
but we ain't got him out.

17:12.383 --> 17:14.248
You fools!
Have little faith.

17:14.250 --> 17:17.046
I swear by every
fiend of felonious fundom

17:17.048 --> 17:21.509
tomorrow all opposition
from the Dynamic Duo will stop!

17:21.511 --> 17:24.839
I've got
the stopper right here.

17:24.842 --> 17:25.607
The last stopper.

17:25.608 --> 17:28.570
- What is it, Joker?
- It's just a cork.

17:28.573 --> 17:29.969
A cork, yes.

17:29.971 --> 17:31.635
But not just a cork.

17:31.637 --> 17:34.766
Queenie, get me
the bottle of champagne.

17:36.167 --> 17:39.129
How are you gonna
stop Batman with that?

17:39.131 --> 17:41.861
You gonna get him drunk?

17:49.058 --> 17:54.420
Here, Queenie, you know
what to do with this now.

17:54.422 --> 17:58.783
Tomorrow night,
champagne for everybody!

17:59.551 --> 18:00.715
<i> What's this?</i>

18:00.717 --> 18:02.315
<i> Batman and Robin done in</i>

18:02.317 --> 18:04.645
<i> by a bottle of champagne?</i>

18:04.647 --> 18:06.445
<i> Impossible!</i>

18:12.843 --> 18:15.905
I don't know what could
be keeping Bruce Wayne

18:15.907 --> 18:19.402
but we just can't
hold this up any longer.

18:19.838 --> 18:23.333
Ladies and gentlemen, it gives
me great pleasure to present

18:23.335 --> 18:26.698
the two people who will
christen the S.S. Gotham.

18:26.700 --> 18:29.328
They hardly need
an introduction.

18:29.330 --> 18:32.293
Batman and Robin the Boy Wonder.

18:34.428 --> 18:36.224
What are you two
guys doing out here

18:36.226 --> 18:40.056
when The Joker is out there
taking over the city?

18:41.423 --> 18:43.186
Uh, sorry about that, Batman.

18:43.188 --> 18:46.750
Forget about it. Let's get on
with the christening, shall we?

18:46.752 --> 18:50.082
Okay. Who, uh,
who's got the champagne?

18:50.084 --> 18:55.444
- Here you are, commissioner.
- Well, thank you, my dear.

18:55.446 --> 18:58.443
The best French champagne.

18:58.778 --> 18:59.941
There you are.

18:59.943 --> 19:01.073
1949.

19:01.075 --> 19:03.372
A very good year.

19:03.374 --> 19:06.203
Something...something
wrong, Batman?

19:06.205 --> 19:07.436
No, no, it's nothing at all.

19:07.438 --> 19:10.668
I...I just feel a slight
headache coming on.

19:10.670 --> 19:13.698
Perhaps one of these tablets..

19:15.899 --> 19:18.229
You better take one too, Robin,
it might be contagious.

19:18.231 --> 19:21.427
Well, gee, Batman, I never
heard of a headache being--

19:21.429 --> 19:23.758
Doctor's orders, chum.

19:23.760 --> 19:26.722
Let me get this
out of your way.

19:27.724 --> 19:33.252
I hereby christen
the S.S. Gotham City.

19:55.905 --> 19:57.335
Queenie, the switch.

20:00.235 --> 20:02.032
You're on the air, Joker.

20:03.633 --> 20:05.296
Good-day. Good-day.

20:05.998 --> 20:10.860
Once more we interrupt your
regularly scheduled program.

20:10.862 --> 20:15.357
This is The Joker speaking
from his secret hideout.

20:16.391 --> 20:20.020
I have an amusing
message for the directors

20:20.022 --> 20:22.818
of the Gotham Steamship Lines.

20:22.820 --> 20:28.881
My terms, deliver me title
to the S.S. Gotham or else..

20:28.883 --> 20:35.077
...or else this whimsical scene
once part of a waxwork museum

20:35.079 --> 20:37.808
will be reenacted
in front your eyes

20:37.810 --> 20:40.773
with the most hideous reality.

20:42.540 --> 20:47.068
You understand, dear fellow
citizens of Gotham City?

20:47.070 --> 20:48.700
I get the S.S. Gotham

20:48.702 --> 20:54.962
or your precious Dynamic Duo
gets launched...to eternity!

20:55.964 --> 20:58.127
Wrong, Joker!<i> You</i> get launched!

20:58.129 --> 21:00.492
Right back to
the pen where you belong!

21:00.494 --> 21:02.357
Egads! What sorcery is this?

21:02.359 --> 21:04.523
There was enough
paralyzing gas in that cork

21:04.525 --> 21:08.154
to keep ordinary men
unconscious for hours.

21:08.156 --> 21:08.887
No sorcery.

21:09.089 --> 21:13.483
Merely the precaution of
a universal drug antidote pill.

21:13.485 --> 21:16.481
You've tripped on one of your
tricks this time, Joker!

21:16.483 --> 21:19.412
That replica of your
utility belt was too exact.

21:19.414 --> 21:23.710
We analyzed the cork in it
and found...paralyzing gas!

21:24.012 --> 21:26.407
I just happened to notice
the seal around the cork

21:26.409 --> 21:31.571
in that bottle of champagne
was <i> not</i> discolored with age.

21:31.573 --> 21:34.669
Odd in a 1949 vintage.

22:44.389 --> 22:46.985
It's back to prison
walls for you, Joker.

22:46.987 --> 22:48.883
Ba-a-a!

22:54.149 --> 22:56.878
I'm afraid you're
under arrest, ma'am.

22:56.880 --> 22:59.343
Couldn't we talk
it over, handsome?

23:02.377 --> 23:05.139
Poor deluded child.

23:14.934 --> 23:16.731
'So with The Joker's capture'

23:16.733 --> 23:19.995
'Gotham City's worst crime wave
in history has come to an end.'

23:19.997 --> 23:24.460
Tonight, once more, we can all
sleep peacefully in our beds

23:24.462 --> 23:28.757
secure in the knowledge that,
as I assured my small son Harold

23:28.759 --> 23:32.520
just eight years old,
"Yes, Harold," I said.

23:32.522 --> 23:35.718
"There is a Batman...
and Robin the Boy Wonder."

23:35.720 --> 23:37.417
'After a word from our sponsor'

23:37.419 --> 23:39.882
'Fred will return with
more news of The Joker.'

23:39.884 --> 23:41.781
It's time for your
piano lesson, Dick.

23:41.783 --> 23:45.278
Aw, gee, Aunt Harriet,
I wanna hear about The Joker.

23:45.280 --> 23:47.176
The Joker?

23:47.878 --> 23:49.108
Bruce Wayne,
I'm surprised at you.

23:49.610 --> 23:56.271
Allowing a boy Dick's age to
listen to such sordid goings on.

23:56.273 --> 24:01.201
Now you march yourself straight
over to that piano, young man.

24:01.203 --> 24:03.499
Golly G-minor,
Bruce, do I have to?

24:03.500 --> 24:05.565
Who am I to oppose
your Aunt Harriet?

24:05.767 --> 24:09.861
I doubt whether even Batman
would wanna take that job on.

24:10.563 --> 24:11.793
I'll get you some

24:11.795 --> 24:12.926
milk and cookies, Master Dick.

24:12.928 --> 24:17.689
Thanks a lot, Alfred.
I can always count on you.
