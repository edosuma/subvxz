00:02.252 --> 00:06.714
That is the most beautiful
engagement ring ever!

00:06.881 --> 00:10.009
You should know,
you bought like a billion of them.

00:11.094 --> 00:12.886
You didn't get one.

00:14.597 --> 00:17.933
- Tonight's the big night.
- How will you ask her?

00:18.101 --> 00:21.103
It'll be perfect.
We'll go to her favorite restaurant.

00:21.271 --> 00:26.442
I'll get her a bottle of the champagne she really
loves, therefore knows how expensive it is.

00:28.153 --> 00:33.240
Then, when the glasses are full, instead
of proposing a toast, I'll propose.

00:33.408 --> 00:35.909
- Aw.
- Sounds perfect!

00:36.828 --> 00:39.038
You'll mess up. Let me do it.

00:39.205 --> 00:40.789
I won't mess up.

00:40.957 --> 00:43.167
If she says no,
can I have the ring?

00:43.752 --> 00:46.712
- She won't say no.
- If?

00:48.965 --> 00:51.675
- Hey.
- Hey.

00:51.843 --> 00:53.469
Hey, Monica.

00:56.389 --> 00:58.307
- Give it.
- It's gone.

00:59.726 --> 01:01.435
Phoebe.

01:04.480 --> 01:06.732
- Hey.
- Hey, Monica!

01:08.735 --> 01:10.778
We're practically kissing.

01:50.610 --> 01:51.735
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:51.903 --> 01:56.782
Anyone free tonight? My boss is
hosting a charity event for kids.

01:56.950 --> 01:59.368
And the more people I bring,
the better I look.

01:59.536 --> 02:01.078
So Monica, Chandler?

02:01.246 --> 02:04.331
We can't go.
We're going to dinner. Remember?

02:04.499 --> 02:08.168
- Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.
- What's the big deal?

02:08.336 --> 02:13.048
I just get mad when Rachel doesn't
remember where we're going.

02:14.467 --> 02:15.884
Where are you going?

02:18.221 --> 02:20.264
- How about you guys?
- Open bar?

02:20.849 --> 02:23.851
- I think so.
- I can do that for the kids.

02:25.061 --> 02:29.356
I'll come. I'm making money now.
It's time I give some back.

02:29.524 --> 02:32.109
You could give back
the money you owe me.

02:33.027 --> 02:35.404
Okay. Have a benefit.

02:38.408 --> 02:41.368
Ross, can you come
to a charity event tonight?

02:41.536 --> 02:43.495
Oh. No, I have plans with Elizabeth.

02:43.663 --> 02:46.373
Oh. You're already doing
your part for the kids.

02:48.501 --> 02:53.172
It's our last night together before she
leaves for camp. To be a counselor.

02:54.966 --> 02:59.553
I have a question. All jokes aside.
Where is this relationship going?

02:59.721 --> 03:02.848
Wait a minute. All jokes aside?
I didn't agree to that.

03:04.475 --> 03:07.853
- Do you see this as long-term thing?
- I don't know.

03:08.021 --> 03:09.897
You are 12 years older than her.

03:10.064 --> 03:12.399
Wait a minute.
Does everyone feel this way?

03:12.567 --> 03:15.027
- Yeah.
- Yeah, sort of.

03:15.195 --> 03:19.907
Uh, wow. Uh, I thought
you were making jokes. I had no idea.

03:20.074 --> 03:24.369
You guys are wrong. Yes, there is
a chronological age difference.

03:24.537 --> 03:28.498
But I never notice it,
because she is very mature.

03:28.666 --> 03:33.462
It doesn't matter what you guys think.
I'm dating Elizabeth, not you.

03:33.630 --> 03:36.089
Not what she said last night.

03:38.259 --> 03:39.968
See, now he could date her.

03:44.724 --> 03:49.102
Will you marry me?

03:49.354 --> 03:51.230
Hey, you marry me.

03:58.988 --> 04:01.573
What's going on, little elves?

04:01.741 --> 04:03.951
It's the big night.
We wanted to wish you luck.

04:04.118 --> 04:06.286
- Yeah. Have the ring?
- In my pocket.

04:06.454 --> 04:07.913
Oh.

04:11.459 --> 04:13.085
- Pheebs.
- Oh. Ha, ha.

04:15.713 --> 04:19.507
Will you guys get out of here? I want this
to be a surprise, and she's gonna know.

04:19.676 --> 04:22.302
Yeah, guys. Get out of here.

04:23.805 --> 04:26.306
Hey. Hi, guys.

04:28.142 --> 04:32.020
- You look beautiful.
- Aww. Thank you.

04:37.402 --> 04:39.403
What's going on?

04:39.570 --> 04:41.405
We're just really...

04:41.572 --> 04:44.616
...excited about this charity event
that we have to go to.

04:50.331 --> 04:52.082
- Here.
- Thank you.

04:52.250 --> 04:54.459
So what's going on here?

04:54.627 --> 04:56.670
Well, uh, this is a silent auction.

04:56.838 --> 05:00.257
They lay the stuff here.
You write down your offer.

05:00.425 --> 05:02.050
The highest bid gets it.

05:02.218 --> 05:06.638
No. I know what a silent auction is.
What's going on with your hair?

05:08.933 --> 05:11.643
- Uh, why?
- No, it's nice.

05:13.229 --> 05:16.106
Nice to see you.
So glad you brought someone.

05:16.316 --> 05:18.150
Someone? I brought people.

05:18.359 --> 05:20.944
This is Phoebe.
Phoebe, this is Mr. Thompson.

05:21.195 --> 05:23.238
- He's the head of my department.
- Oh, hi.

05:23.406 --> 05:27.159
- And I also brought my friend Joey.
- Ohh! Shrimp toast!

05:28.453 --> 05:31.538
You know, I don't know where he is.

05:32.457 --> 05:33.915
I hope you're gonna bid.

05:34.083 --> 05:37.669
Actually, I was about to bid
on this lovely trip to Paris.

05:37.837 --> 05:39.254
- Nice choice.
- Yeah.

05:39.422 --> 05:41.381
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

05:41.549 --> 05:42.716
Ha.

05:42.884 --> 05:46.595
Okay, $20.00.

05:54.270 --> 05:57.022
Shut the door! Shut the door!

05:57.190 --> 05:58.523
What's going on?

05:58.691 --> 06:01.026
Guys across the hall
are throwing water balloons.

06:01.194 --> 06:05.030
Call the police. That's what I did
to kids in my building.

06:05.198 --> 06:07.949
No, it's a water balloon fight.
We started it.

06:08.117 --> 06:10.243
Oh. Hmm.

06:10.411 --> 06:14.623
Um, I just stopped by to see
if you wanted to see this play tonight.

06:14.791 --> 06:17.000
Um, it's excellent. The director is...

06:17.168 --> 06:20.087
- Who drank all the kamikazes?
- Nobody. We put them in here!

06:22.048 --> 06:25.258
- You want some?
- No, I... Okay, okay.

06:25.426 --> 06:30.013
- Could I talk to you for a second?
- Yeah, sure.

06:30.181 --> 06:32.140
Um, so this play, um,
what do you think?

06:32.308 --> 06:35.394
- It's gotten great reviews.
- Attack!

06:37.605 --> 06:41.108
- Put your balloons down!
- You put your balloons down!

06:41.275 --> 06:45.862
Everybody put their balloons down!

06:47.740 --> 06:50.283
Now, this is a nice suit!

06:53.663 --> 06:57.124
Our next item is
the romantic trip to Paris.

06:57.291 --> 07:02.129
It goes to Emil Alexander
with a high bid of $2300.

07:02.296 --> 07:04.423
Oh! So close!

07:05.883 --> 07:08.343
Hey, you guys, look.
Got me some drinks.

07:10.054 --> 07:13.056
- What are you doing?
- Open bar.

07:14.058 --> 07:16.309
Finally, our biggest item
of the night.

07:16.477 --> 07:19.980
The 22-foot
Gentleman's Daysailer sailboat.

07:20.148 --> 07:24.985
The winning bid
was a whopping $20,000.

07:25.153 --> 07:26.570
I won!

07:28.114 --> 07:30.115
That was my guess!

07:31.033 --> 07:32.325
What? What? What?

07:32.493 --> 07:34.453
I guessed $20,000.

07:35.037 --> 07:39.916
Joey, it is an auction.
You don't guess. You buy!

07:40.084 --> 07:41.376
What?

07:43.463 --> 07:45.005
I don't have $20,000.

07:45.173 --> 07:48.008
Congratulations on your new boat,
Joey Tribbiani.

07:52.472 --> 07:53.930
Joey, sit down.

07:54.474 --> 07:57.726
Forget her. You enjoy this. Whoo!

08:14.660 --> 08:16.328
What are you doing?

08:16.913 --> 08:18.497
"One nation...

08:19.499 --> 08:24.336
...under God, indivisible,
with liberty and justice for all."

08:24.504 --> 08:27.672
Ha, ha. I remembered it.
The champagne is here.

08:28.341 --> 08:30.008
- Are you okay?
- Yes. Yes.

08:30.176 --> 08:31.676
I'm good. Are you good?

08:31.844 --> 08:33.886
Are you perfect?

08:34.514 --> 08:35.722
Yeah. I'm okay.

08:35.890 --> 08:37.890
I'm a little cold.
Can I have your jacket?

08:38.058 --> 08:39.476
Oh. Yeah.

08:39.644 --> 08:42.479
Uh, no, you can't have my jacket.

08:43.356 --> 08:45.607
Because then I would be cold.

08:46.192 --> 08:49.986
If you thought you'd be cold,
you should have brought a jacket.

08:51.489 --> 08:53.406
Uh, other than that, are you okay?

08:55.618 --> 08:57.202
Are you sure you're okay?

08:57.370 --> 08:59.996
Yes. I'm fine.

09:00.206 --> 09:05.335
In fact, I've been fine
for a long time now and I think...

09:05.545 --> 09:07.128
...the reason is you.

09:08.339 --> 09:09.631
That's sweet.

09:09.840 --> 09:11.883
Okay. Um.

09:13.553 --> 09:18.306
Before I met you,
I had really little life.

09:18.474 --> 09:21.059
And I couldn't imagine growing old...

09:21.227 --> 09:22.435
Oh, my God.

09:22.603 --> 09:25.230
- I know. But let me say it.
- Oh, my God. Richard.

09:25.398 --> 09:27.732
What? I'm Chandler.

09:30.069 --> 09:31.611
Oh, that's Richard.

09:33.573 --> 09:35.782
Maybe he won't see us.
Richard!

09:39.912 --> 09:43.373
- Monica. Chandler.
- Hey.

09:44.709 --> 09:46.501
I don't know why I did that.

09:47.920 --> 09:51.381
- It's good to see you.
- You too. You let your hair grow.

09:51.549 --> 09:54.175
Yeah. Oh, that's right,
you always wanted me to.

09:54.343 --> 09:56.136
I see your mustache is back.

09:56.304 --> 09:58.680
Well, my nose got lonely.

09:58.848 --> 10:01.850
And you don't have a mustache,
which is good. Ha, ha.

10:03.811 --> 10:07.022
I'm Chandler.
I make jokes when I'm uncomfortable.

10:07.773 --> 10:12.694
I'm sorry. Lisa, Monica, Chandler.
We used to date.

10:12.862 --> 10:15.614
Richard!
No one's supposed to know about us!

10:18.200 --> 10:20.327
See, I did it again.

10:21.537 --> 10:24.080
- Chandler, sit down.
- I'll sit down.

10:24.248 --> 10:25.290
Good to see you.

10:25.499 --> 10:27.042
Your table is ready, sir.

10:27.293 --> 10:29.085
- Oh. Good to see you guys.
- Yes.

10:29.253 --> 10:31.296
If you prefer, this table's available.

10:32.673 --> 10:34.549
That might be fun.

10:39.221 --> 10:40.930
What were you thinking?

10:41.140 --> 10:43.016
I didn't know it was an auction.

10:43.184 --> 10:44.643
I figured I'd take a guess.

10:44.894 --> 10:48.188
Help a charity. Free boat!

10:48.356 --> 10:51.024
Why would a charity
give away a free boat?

10:51.192 --> 10:53.985
- I don't know. Charity?
- Oh!

10:55.112 --> 10:57.530
Well, just buy the damn boat.

10:58.491 --> 11:01.368
Phoebe, don't you think
you've had enough to drink?

11:01.535 --> 11:03.662
I'm just helping the kids.

11:04.997 --> 11:07.666
How is you drinking helping the kids?

11:07.833 --> 11:11.836
Because the more I drink, the less
there is for the kids to drink.

11:15.841 --> 11:19.177
Mr. Tribbiani.
Your contribution brings us...

11:19.345 --> 11:21.846
...a big step closer
to building the youth center.

11:22.306 --> 11:25.100
Just out of curiosity,
how much is that boat worth?

11:25.267 --> 11:27.143
I think it was valued at 19,000.

11:27.311 --> 11:29.771
Hey, I was pretty close.

11:33.025 --> 11:35.193
Uh, so, bad news.

11:35.361 --> 11:39.531
Um, I can't buy the boat.
I don't have any money.

11:42.952 --> 11:45.870
Joey! Joey, good one!

11:47.832 --> 11:49.165
Good! Very good!

11:53.921 --> 11:58.049
- So, uh, I think I'm gonna take off now.
- You can't leave, Joey!

11:58.217 --> 12:01.386
You agreed to buy that boat.
It is a contract.

12:01.554 --> 12:04.222
Plus, if you leave,
my boss is gonna kill me.

12:04.390 --> 12:07.350
Well, what am I gonna do, Rach?
I don't have that kind of money.

12:07.518 --> 12:09.269
I know. Okay, okay, okay, okay.

12:09.437 --> 12:10.687
This is what we'll do.

12:10.855 --> 12:14.649
We'll go to the next highest bidder,
and we'll let them buy it.

12:14.817 --> 12:17.026
Then you're just gonna
pay the difference.

12:17.194 --> 12:18.236
Okay.

12:18.404 --> 12:21.448
I don't know why the kids need a
youth center anyway.

12:21.615 --> 12:26.286
They should just watch TV after school
like I did. And I turned out fine.

12:27.329 --> 12:28.413
Not great.

12:31.083 --> 12:33.126
So we're hiding in the bathroom...

12:33.294 --> 12:36.796
Then I sneak out. But before
Monica can, her parents come in.

12:36.964 --> 12:39.007
I hid in the shower,
next thing you know...

12:39.175 --> 12:41.217
...they're going at it on the floor.

12:41.385 --> 12:42.677
Oh, my God!

12:42.845 --> 12:44.179
I got a good one.

12:44.346 --> 12:48.641
I once walked in on both my parents
making love to the same guy.

12:54.815 --> 12:59.194
It's so great seeing you guys again.
I'd like to make a toast.

12:59.361 --> 13:03.323
Uh, as a poet once said,
"In the sweetness of friendship...

13:03.616 --> 13:06.618
...let there be laughter
and sharing of pleasures...

13:07.203 --> 13:08.995
...for in the dew of little things...

13:09.163 --> 13:12.123
...the heart finds its morning and is
refreshed."

13:12.291 --> 13:13.458
Aw.

13:14.960 --> 13:16.211
What?

13:24.136 --> 13:25.762
Oh, my God! You guys!

13:25.930 --> 13:30.016
Before you say anything, have we got a story
for you. Guess who we bumped into?

13:30.184 --> 13:32.185
- Who?
- Richard!

13:32.728 --> 13:35.230
Oh. Oh.

13:36.065 --> 13:38.066
I thought you were going out
with Elizabeth.

13:38.234 --> 13:42.028
I was. Uh, she was a little busy
with a water balloon fight.

13:42.196 --> 13:45.532
Sometimes grownups have commitments
they can't get out of.

13:46.700 --> 13:48.910
Maybe she is too young for me.

13:49.078 --> 13:53.373
When I was over there,
I felt like I was a babysitter.

13:53.582 --> 13:57.919
I finally see what you were talking
about. I don't know what to do.

13:58.087 --> 14:01.506
Just weigh the good stuff about
the relationship against the bad.

14:01.674 --> 14:05.885
That's what I did when I first started
weighing stuff.

14:06.971 --> 14:11.933
Okay, um, bad stuff.
I'm 12 years older than she is.

14:12.101 --> 14:13.893
If school finds out, you're fired.

14:14.061 --> 14:17.063
- She's leaving for three months.
- For camp.

14:18.607 --> 14:20.567
Okay, good stuff. Um...

14:20.734 --> 14:23.695
Well, she's sweet and pretty and...

14:24.196 --> 14:27.949
The only question you need to ask
is, do you see a future?

14:28.117 --> 14:31.202
Do you see yourself marrying her?

14:31.787 --> 14:34.956
My God. You did it already.
You married her, didn't you?

14:36.750 --> 14:40.336
No, I didn't do that.
It's just...

14:41.213 --> 14:45.842
Honestly, no,
I don't see a big future with her.

14:46.802 --> 14:49.220
Okay, I think that's your answer.

14:49.430 --> 14:52.390
I gotta talk to her.
I hate this part.

14:52.558 --> 14:55.018
Forget Elizabeth.
If you're not careful...

14:55.269 --> 14:58.563
...you may not get married
at all this year.

15:02.568 --> 15:03.735
Rach, Rach.

15:03.903 --> 15:06.446
- Next highest bidder is at table one.
- Great.

15:06.697 --> 15:09.866
The guy who got the Paris trip
is at table four.

15:10.034 --> 15:12.368
You care about the guy
who won the Paris trip?

15:12.536 --> 15:13.703
It's a trip for two.

15:14.580 --> 15:15.997
Excuse me.

15:21.503 --> 15:25.423
Excuse me. Is the person who won
the Paris trip at this table?

15:25.591 --> 15:28.092
- That was me.
- Oh. Enchanté.

15:31.972 --> 15:34.724
Uh, is there
a Mr. Bowmont at this table?

15:34.892 --> 15:36.726
- That's me.
- Ah.

15:36.894 --> 15:40.980
Hello. This is your
lucky day, Mr. Bowmont.

15:41.148 --> 15:45.193
The, uh, Gentleman Daysailer
has become available again.

15:45.361 --> 15:48.446
I believe you made a bid of $18,000?

15:48.614 --> 15:51.658
You have to pay that.
It's not just a guess.

15:54.995 --> 15:57.538
I was actually relieved,
uh, I didn't win the boat.

15:57.748 --> 15:59.499
My wife would've killed me.

15:59.667 --> 16:02.001
Are you kidding?
She'll love this boat!

16:02.169 --> 16:04.629
- What is your wife's name?
- It's Pam.

16:04.797 --> 16:08.967
It's Pam. Just imagine this.
The Pam.

16:09.134 --> 16:10.885
Aw.

16:11.929 --> 16:13.846
I don't think she'd like that.

16:14.556 --> 16:17.600
Okay. Uh, imagine this:
The Mr. Bowmont.

16:17.768 --> 16:18.851
Ooh.

16:19.353 --> 16:20.561
I don't think so.

16:20.729 --> 16:23.773
Okay, look. Let me paint you
a little picture. All right.

16:23.941 --> 16:28.444
You are setting sail up the Hudson.
You've got the wind in your ha... Arms.

16:30.531 --> 16:34.534
You get all that peace and quiet
you've always wanted.

16:34.702 --> 16:37.704
You get back to nature.
You can go fishing.

16:37.871 --> 16:41.582
You get one of those hats,
people call you captain.

16:41.750 --> 16:44.419
And then when you're old, Cappy.

16:45.879 --> 16:48.548
What the hell. It's for a good cause.
All right!

16:48.716 --> 16:51.551
- No way! It's mine!
- What?

16:53.846 --> 16:55.638
The stuff you said, I want that!

16:55.806 --> 16:58.558
But, Joey, you don't have $20,000!

16:58.726 --> 17:02.395
Who cares? I'll make payments!
I want the Mr. Bowmont!

17:08.569 --> 17:09.944
Oh, my God! You're back!

17:10.112 --> 17:11.820
Let me see your hand!

17:13.323 --> 17:15.074
Why do you want to see my hand?

17:15.242 --> 17:18.036
I want to see what's in your hand,
the trash.

17:21.040 --> 17:25.042
Ew, it's all dirty.
You should throw this out.

17:26.045 --> 17:27.837
Okay.

17:30.090 --> 17:32.592
- What did you just do?
- What happened?

17:32.760 --> 17:36.262
- Richard was there. I couldn't do it.
- Oh, no.

17:36.430 --> 17:40.183
I was gonna do it tomorrow and surprise her.
Now you've ruined it.

17:40.350 --> 17:41.809
We didn't.

17:41.977 --> 17:44.729
Who walks into a room
and asks to see a person's hands?

17:45.856 --> 17:50.276
A palm reader, a manicurist,
a hand doctor.

17:50.444 --> 17:53.529
- Glove salesman.
- Good one!

17:55.532 --> 17:57.909
This is terrible.
What am I gonna do?

17:58.077 --> 18:02.497
She only suspects something.
So just throw her off the track.

18:02.664 --> 18:06.125
I'll make her think, uh, marriage
is the last thing on my mind.

18:06.293 --> 18:09.003
Yeah. Convince her you're scared
of commitment.

18:09.171 --> 18:11.881
I can do that.
I've had 30 years of practice.

18:12.049 --> 18:14.092
Being you is finally gonna pay off!

18:16.720 --> 18:18.137
Had to go to the basement...

18:18.388 --> 18:21.974
...some idiot keeps stuffing
the chute with pizza boxes.

18:22.559 --> 18:24.894
That guy's still doing that?

18:26.855 --> 18:29.398
Hey. My God, let me see your hand!

18:29.566 --> 18:33.236
No, you're too late!
She already took out the trash!

18:41.328 --> 18:47.125
Wow. I have never had
such a healthy breakup.

18:47.376 --> 18:50.628
She was such a grownup about it.

18:50.963 --> 18:54.132
She didn't seem too immature for me.

18:54.883 --> 18:58.344
Did I just make a huge mistake?

18:58.512 --> 19:00.096
Ross? Wait!

19:00.264 --> 19:03.724
Elizabeth, thank God.
I was just thinking about...

19:03.892 --> 19:05.935
You suck!

19:06.103 --> 19:07.186
What?

19:13.235 --> 19:14.819
Okay.

19:14.987 --> 19:17.780
Breakup's still on.

19:25.747 --> 19:26.873
Here she comes.

19:27.040 --> 19:29.667
Do I look like a guy
who doesn't want to get married?

19:29.877 --> 19:31.335
Yeah.

19:31.503 --> 19:34.130
And, also, a little like a
French guy.

19:37.259 --> 19:39.135
I never noticed that before.

19:40.721 --> 19:42.388
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

19:42.556 --> 19:43.681
What are you up to?

19:43.849 --> 19:46.934
Just hanging out.
Talking about, uh, web sites.

19:47.102 --> 19:48.144
Ha.

19:48.812 --> 19:52.440
Ahem. We saw this interesting website
about marriage.

19:52.691 --> 19:54.775
How unnecessary it is.

19:54.985 --> 19:57.778
How it's a way for governments
to keep tabs on you.

19:57.988 --> 19:59.739
Yeah, Big Brother. Ha, ha.

20:01.074 --> 20:02.408
That's a little crazy.

20:02.576 --> 20:07.038
Although I am glad you're looking
at other things on the Internet.

20:07.915 --> 20:11.709
Got me thinking, why would anybody
want to get married?

20:11.877 --> 20:16.130
Why? To celebrate the relationship.
To solidify the commitment.

20:16.381 --> 20:19.133
To declare your love for one another
to the world.

20:20.052 --> 20:21.344
Eh.

20:23.055 --> 20:25.097
Okay. Well, that's good to know.

20:28.101 --> 20:29.977
The Mr. Bowmont's here!

20:36.109 --> 20:39.528
A customer wants to compliment you.
Shall I let him in?

20:39.696 --> 20:42.073
Sure! I love this part!

20:42.741 --> 20:45.159
- Come on in.
- Hi.

20:45.911 --> 20:47.161
Richard.

20:47.371 --> 20:49.747
I'm not here to compliment the chef.

20:49.915 --> 20:53.459
Oh. I hate when people come back
to compliment the chef.

20:53.627 --> 20:56.045
Like I've nothing better to do.

20:57.422 --> 20:58.506
What's up?

20:58.674 --> 21:01.384
It was great seeing you
the other night.

21:01.551 --> 21:03.469
Good to see you too.

21:05.305 --> 21:06.764
Come down here
to tell me that?

21:06.932 --> 21:10.434
No. Came here to tell you
something else.

21:12.104 --> 21:15.481
Came here to tell you
I still love you.
