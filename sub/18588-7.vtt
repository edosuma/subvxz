00:07.469 --> 00:09.418
So you're now a delivery point?

00:09.419 --> 00:11.739
Congratulations!
I'm very happy for you.

00:11.740 --> 00:13.898
Just one thing...

00:13.899 --> 00:16.588
what does it mean?

00:16.589 --> 00:19.589
This should not be taken as
any evidence that I am dim.

00:20.819 --> 00:22.458
Are you sure?

00:22.459 --> 00:24.328
I was top in school in geography.

00:24.329 --> 00:27.329
I was the only one who knew
where Calcutta was.

00:28.870 --> 00:32.168
As long as you're sure that
you can absorb new information.

00:32.589 --> 00:35.589
Oh, I can handle
any amount of information.

00:35.959 --> 00:38.308
I'm a sponge, me.

00:38.309 --> 00:40.688
Where is Calcutta anyway?

00:40.689 --> 00:44.122
The best way is down
the A19 as far as York.

00:45.669 --> 00:47.588
0h.

00:47.589 --> 00:50.589
Supposing you buy something
from the internet,

00:51.459 --> 00:54.459
they can have their stuff delivered
here at the delivery point

00:56.259 --> 00:58.978
and then they can pick it up
whenever they want.

00:58.979 --> 01:00.658
Pick up what?

01:00.659 --> 01:03.378
HORN TOOTS

01:03.379 --> 01:05.859
I'm late back.

01:05.860 --> 01:08.258
And why am I late back?

01:08.259 --> 01:10.498
I got caught by Mr Mottram.

01:10.499 --> 01:12.658
Not with Mrs Mottram, I hope.

01:12.659 --> 01:15.659
Do you mind?
She's less feminine than Mr Mottram.

01:16.029 --> 01:19.029
It's only because she won't shave.

01:19.949 --> 01:22.949
Mr Mottram can talk forever
about steam railways.

01:23.589 --> 01:26.589
I bet he doesn't know
where Calcutta is.

01:45.029 --> 01:48.029
HE GROANS

01:56.109 --> 01:58.948
All right, come here.

01:58.949 --> 02:01.949
Come on, you're going to have
to learn some time.

02:02.389 --> 02:05.389
Off you go.

02:14.109 --> 02:16.048
TILL RINGS

02:16.049 --> 02:19.049
CLATTERING

02:43.469 --> 02:46.469
TILL RINGS

02:49.069 --> 02:52.069
CLATTERING

02:58.740 --> 03:01.740
Ah!

03:06.179 --> 03:09.179
I'm getting very worried
about this counter space.

03:09.870 --> 03:12.870
Don't speak to me, I'm not here.
Well, where are you, then?

03:12.979 --> 03:15.979
Asleep, in bed,
where any sane person ought to be.

03:16.149 --> 03:18.598
You young people,
you don't know you're born.

03:18.599 --> 03:21.599
When I were your age, we had to
get up before we even went to bed.

03:25.059 --> 03:28.059
Yes, I'm worried about
this counter space.

03:28.179 --> 03:29.978
That's another thing.

03:29.979 --> 03:32.979
Who in their right mind would be
worrying about counter space?

03:35.239 --> 03:38.158
Because".

03:38.159 --> 03:39.778
You know,

03:39.779 --> 03:42.688
when the world is full
of beauty and magnificence,

03:42.689 --> 03:45.258
and Georgina Middleford?

03:45.259 --> 03:48.259
We're going to have to cut you down
on your carbohydrates, you.

03:49.269 --> 03:51.538
She looked at me
and I could hear music.

03:51.539 --> 03:54.539
Although, fair enough,
we were in a disco.

04:00.630 --> 04:03.630
I saw him last night with his tart.

04:04.409 --> 04:07.409
Tart?!
That were prime real estate, mate!

04:08.099 --> 04:10.898
If she was a building,
she'd be Grade I listed.

04:10.899 --> 04:13.899
She looked like something
Mother used to warn me against.

04:15.539 --> 04:18.539
And I was stupid enough to listen.

04:18.750 --> 04:21.137
I suppose it's too late now.

04:21.139 --> 04:24.139
No, no, it's never too late.
Remember, there's Madge out there.

04:25.669 --> 04:28.669
Don't you think
she lacks personality?

04:29.909 --> 04:32.909
She's got tonnes of personality.

04:33.029 --> 04:36.029
It's nasty, but it's there.

04:36.669 --> 04:39.669
You're not a great judge of women,
Gastric.

04:39.699 --> 04:42.699
The wife said that,
in her very last letter.

04:44.059 --> 04:45.948
Oh, sorry!
I didn't realise she was dead.

04:45.949 --> 04:48.949
She's not dead.
She's living with a bloke in Luton.

04:51.630 --> 04:54.308
Well, that's close enough.

04:54.309 --> 04:56.778
I came home, found this note,

04:56.779 --> 04:59.779
"I'm leaving you.
Your dinner's in the oven."

05:00.669 --> 05:03.348
Macaroni cheese.

05:03.349 --> 05:06.349
I could forgive her the bloke in
Luton, but I mean, macaroni cheese!

05:08.699 --> 05:10.778
Oh, dear! Gastric!

05:10.779 --> 05:13.779
Isn't it strange how fate
moves in mysterious ways?

05:16.679 --> 05:19.679
Because Madge hates macaroni cheese!

05:21.229 --> 05:23.619
But is that enough
for a relationship?

05:23.620 --> 05:25.788
Oh, yes, I mean, it's got legs,

05:25.789 --> 05:28.789
it's much better than
any physical attraction.

05:29.669 --> 05:31.629
I don't wish to believe that.

05:31.630 --> 05:34.630
Just a minute, you, Grade I listed,

05:35.059 --> 05:37.668
you do realise you need
planning permission

05:37.669 --> 05:40.669
before you tamper with anything?

05:46.789 --> 05:49.789
Should've gone to Australia
when we had the chance.

05:49.829 --> 05:51.668
I'm not going to Australia!

05:51.669 --> 05:54.118
It's full of spiders!

05:54.119 --> 05:56.749
Well, Auntie Jesse's daughter's
doing all right.

05:56.750 --> 05:59.750
She speaks the language.

06:00.309 --> 06:02.678
At least they've got sunlight there.

06:02.679 --> 06:05.268
It's been dark here all week.

06:05.269 --> 06:07.948
Their noses go white.

06:07.949 --> 06:10.138
It's a sun cream.

06:10.139 --> 06:13.139
I don't suppose
anything else is white.

06:14.469 --> 06:17.469
I'm still not going.

06:17.779 --> 06:20.779
Don't you ever get bored
with the way things are?

06:21.189 --> 06:23.308
You're just like Dolly.

06:23.309 --> 06:25.238
Oh, Dolly was nice.

06:25.239 --> 06:28.239
And now she's dead.
Fat lot of good it did her.

06:28.909 --> 06:31.128
Are you saying nice is fatal?

06:31.129 --> 06:33.478
You think nasty lives longer?

06:33.479 --> 06:36.428
Doesn't it?
And certainly often better.

06:36.429 --> 06:39.138
And it's going to be different
in Australia?

06:39.139 --> 06:42.139
I'm just fed up with looking
at people's heads.

06:43.109 --> 06:44.828
Could be worse.

06:44.829 --> 06:47.468
You could be a prostate surgeon.

06:47.469 --> 06:50.469
SHE CHUCKLES

06:50.760 --> 06:53.760
Right, Leroy, here, come on,
come in here a minute.

06:54.199 --> 06:57.199
I want to show you something.
Oh, you drag me from me washing...

06:59.869 --> 07:02.869
Look, MY friends would be humbled
at the range of my activities.

07:03.109 --> 07:05.858
Yes, well, don't worry about that.
Come in there, into the shop,

07:05.859 --> 07:08.859
where the customer stands, go on.

07:08.959 --> 07:11.468
Is this an exam, hm?

07:11.469 --> 07:14.469
Will there be a written paper?

07:28.699 --> 07:31.699
See, we've been wasting this space,
doing nothing with it.

07:31.959 --> 07:34.188
There's no room behind there
as it is.

07:34.189 --> 07:37.189
This is
prime advertising space here.

07:37.829 --> 07:40.829
Right in front
of the customer's face, that.

07:41.109 --> 07:42.958
Look. May I say one word?

07:42.959 --> 07:45.959
You may. Balloons.

07:52.760 --> 07:54.749
Oh, keep still!

07:54.750 --> 07:57.750
Hey, it's a haircut,
not an execution!

07:59.149 --> 08:02.149
She's in one of those moods
best described as "bad".

08:02.909 --> 08:05.118
I am this week, I admit.

08:05.119 --> 08:08.119
You don't do so bad most weeks.

08:08.139 --> 08:11.139
I've always held you up as the
perfect example of feminine malice.

08:13.399 --> 08:15.918
We don't just come here for
the hairstyles, you know -

08:15.919 --> 08:18.868
we come here
for the lessons in nasty.

08:18.869 --> 08:21.869
Let's be honest,
there's none of us need any lessons.

08:25.319 --> 08:27.228
What's it all about this week?

08:27.229 --> 08:29.548
I don't know,
I just hate everything.

08:29.549 --> 08:31.998
Sounds reasonable to me.

08:31.999 --> 08:34.629
We all get times like that.

08:34.630 --> 08:36.398
Wednesdays.

08:36.399 --> 08:38.138
Why Wednesdays?

08:38.139 --> 08:41.139
There's something about Eric
on Wednesdays.

08:41.318 --> 08:43.668
Six out of seven's not bad.

08:43.669 --> 08:45.588
I know what she means.

08:45.589 --> 08:48.509
My third husband was
a nuisance on Fridays.

08:48.510 --> 08:50.308
It was his day off.

08:50.309 --> 08:53.309
He seemed to be under the impression
that it was playtime.

08:54.959 --> 08:57.959
I wake up in the morning thinking,
"Shouldn't there be something more?"

09:00.139 --> 09:03.139
That was him on Fridays.

09:04.399 --> 09:06.318
I think she needs a man.

09:06.319 --> 09:09.319
At least it would give her a focus
to be miserable about.

09:09.760 --> 09:12.118
Nobody NEEDS a man.

09:12.119 --> 09:15.119
They're just sort of inevitable.

09:15.589 --> 09:17.708
If you keep them
below room temperature,

09:17.709 --> 09:20.629
you'd hardly know they were there.

09:20.630 --> 09:23.028
I don't fancy one full-time
in the house,

09:23.029 --> 09:26.029
but it would be nice to have
one for special occasions.

09:28.149 --> 09:30.868
They say married men
make the best lovers...

09:30.869 --> 09:33.869
but I suspect that's when
they're playing away.

09:35.579 --> 09:37.788
They say that woman
in Hardwick Street

09:37.789 --> 09:40.068
was lifted completely
out of her depression

09:40.069 --> 09:42.218
by him that came to fix her boiler.

09:42.219 --> 09:45.219
Well, I don't want
anybody fixing MY boiler.

09:46.359 --> 09:48.908
You could use
a bit of companionship.

09:48.909 --> 09:51.038
Get a cat!

09:51.039 --> 09:54.039
Oh, dear, married bliss
taking a bit of a dip?

09:54.789 --> 09:57.789
Do you know what I found
in Eric's pocket?

09:59.149 --> 10:00.778
A lady's stocking.

10:00.779 --> 10:03.108
THEY GASP

10:03.109 --> 10:06.109
You go through his pockets?

10:30.510 --> 10:33.510
SHE SCREAMS

10:34.709 --> 10:36.759
I believe this is yours, madam?

10:36.760 --> 10:39.760
HE CHUCKLES

11:08.309 --> 11:11.309
Go on. Tell Leroy,
he'll have some ideas.

11:12.419 --> 11:15.419
He's always covered in totty.

11:15.919 --> 11:18.919
Wouldn't say always. Tell him.

11:18.949 --> 11:21.949
Get some help.
I'm beyond all human aid.

11:23.229 --> 11:26.229
His wife found a woman's stocking
in his pocket.

11:27.750 --> 11:30.750
He's right,
he's beyond all human aid.

11:31.189 --> 11:34.189
I think we ought to give him
a bit of support.

11:34.199 --> 11:36.038
Support?!

11:36.039 --> 11:39.039
I'm already wearing
more than cricketers wear!

11:40.149 --> 11:43.149
She's got a brutal elbow
when you're not expecting it!

11:45.189 --> 11:47.938
Listen, I've been listening
to you lot in there.

11:47.939 --> 11:50.939
Now, come on, you ought
to lighten up, right?

11:55.919 --> 11:57.268
There.

11:57.269 --> 12:00.269
HE CHUCKLES

12:09.359 --> 12:12.298
Is this a delivery point?
Yes, it is.

12:12.299 --> 12:15.299
I've got an item for you.
All right, bring it in.

12:30.479 --> 12:32.158
Sign here.

12:32.159 --> 12:35.159
We're going to need a bigger cat.

12:36.229 --> 12:38.028
SOFT MUSIC PLAYS ON RADIO

12:38.029 --> 12:41.029
KNOCK AT DOOR

12:45.949 --> 12:48.838
How long are you planning
on staying sulking up here?

12:48.839 --> 12:50.509
Forever.

12:50.510 --> 12:53.510
Oh, well, as long as
you've got some goal in mind.

12:54.159 --> 12:57.148
I should probably go
on hunger strike.

12:57.149 --> 13:00.149
No lunch, then?
I thought maybe after lunch.

13:03.309 --> 13:06.228
Why are you always so placid?

13:06.229 --> 13:08.548
Oh, I was happy to find I'm placid.

13:08.549 --> 13:11.519
For years, I thought I was stupid.

13:11.520 --> 13:14.520
Don't you ever get
totally, absolutely,

13:15.309 --> 13:18.309
mind-bogglingly fed up with things?

13:18.869 --> 13:21.869
You know I'm no good at decisions.

13:25.149 --> 13:28.149
So, she finds one stocking
in your pocket

13:28.760 --> 13:31.760
and now she thinks
you're being unfaithful?

13:31.929 --> 13:33.389
That's right.

13:33.390 --> 13:36.390
Unfaithful with somebody
with one leg?

13:38.669 --> 13:41.669
They nail you for one leg
as viciously as two.

13:43.869 --> 13:46.438
Well, that's how they are.

13:46.439 --> 13:49.108
No sense of proportion.

13:49.109 --> 13:52.109
It seems to me not unreasonable
that they might wonder

13:52.269 --> 13:54.838
how this stocking came to be
in your pocket.

13:54.839 --> 13:57.708
I thought it were a scarf.

13:57.709 --> 14:00.709
Hang about, just a minute, when
you were removing this stocking,

14:01.640 --> 14:03.078
didn't you think,

14:03.079 --> 14:06.079
"Well, it's a bit, you know,
like, some way from the neck?"

14:06.229 --> 14:09.229
I've heard of poor sense of
direction, but that's pushing it.

14:10.439 --> 14:13.028
I didn't take it off!

14:13.029 --> 14:16.029
It came to me empty.

14:18.479 --> 14:20.438
What, with no leg in it?

14:20.439 --> 14:23.158
Well, of course no leg in it!

14:23.159 --> 14:26.159
What would I be doing
with a leg in me pocket?!

14:29.448 --> 14:31.527
Whose stocking is it?

14:31.528 --> 14:33.717
I've no idea.

14:33.718 --> 14:35.637
What, you told that to Kath?!

14:35.638 --> 14:37.237
No wonder she doesn't believe you.

14:37.238 --> 14:38.897
WE don't believe you.

14:38.898 --> 14:40.327
Even if it is true,

14:40.328 --> 14:43.187
on occasions like this,
you're better off with a lie.

14:43.188 --> 14:46.087
Kath can spot a lie at 50 paces.

14:46.088 --> 14:49.088
There is no reasonable lie
that can explain

14:49.638 --> 14:52.247
a lady's stocking in your pocket.

14:52.248 --> 14:55.248
Can we stop talking about lies?!

14:55.808 --> 14:57.887
I was stood in the pub,

14:57.888 --> 15:00.888
this fella brushed up
against me, he said,

15:00.928 --> 15:03.928
"Here, take this. I don't want
the wife to catch me with it,"

15:04.448 --> 15:06.537
and then he rushed off out.

15:06.538 --> 15:09.538
I thought it were a scarf,

15:09.998 --> 15:12.998
so I put it in my pocket
and waited for him to come back!

15:17.609 --> 15:19.997
I stand corrected.

15:19.998 --> 15:21.887
Thank you.

15:21.888 --> 15:24.888
That's a damn good lie. Yeah.

15:28.078 --> 15:31.078
He's looking better, I think,
since I got him on antacids.

15:31.359 --> 15:33.987
Does he suffer from excess acid?

15:33.988 --> 15:35.967
No more than the next chap.

15:35.968 --> 15:38.968
He used to sound like
the bath emptying.

15:40.528 --> 15:42.837
Sounds like a nervous stomach to me.

15:42.838 --> 15:45.838
Eric's got one,
and it's going to get worse.

15:45.968 --> 15:47.807
It's you.

15:47.808 --> 15:49.757
You fly straight to my stomach.

15:49.758 --> 15:52.407
You're in the first flush
of a new romance, man.

15:52.408 --> 15:54.957
That's not where
you're supposed to get excited.

15:54.958 --> 15:56.687
I'm new at this.

15:56.688 --> 15:59.247
Yes, and we'll both be old
if you don't stir yourself.

15:59.248 --> 16:01.598
It's fear, that's what it is.

16:01.599 --> 16:03.837
You overwhelm me.

16:03.838 --> 16:06.838
Oh, surely not,
after our magical picnic for two.

16:08.688 --> 16:11.688
When? Possibly very shortly,
if you stop this bolshiness.

16:25.168 --> 16:28.168
HE HUMS TO HIMSELF

16:39.768 --> 16:42.047
Ah, you're just in time.

16:42.048 --> 16:43.557
For what?

16:43.558 --> 16:45.967
To catch the bus to paradise...

16:45.968 --> 16:48.968
from my bedroom.
I've shifted the baked beans.

16:49.258 --> 16:52.047
But I've got Madge,
who's taken to her bed.

16:52.048 --> 16:54.927
It's a bad time
for buses to paradise.

16:54.928 --> 16:57.928
Oh, I've got a feeling
the wheel's coming off already.

16:58.088 --> 17:00.407
She's on one of her two-day sulks.

17:00.408 --> 17:03.408
She goes to her bedroom
and she practises being nasty.

17:03.638 --> 17:06.637
She has to practise being nasty?!

17:08.178 --> 17:11.178
Listen, I've got an idea.

17:11.768 --> 17:14.768
Why don't we send Gastric over
to release some of his passion

17:18.328 --> 17:21.328
to show her that she's still wanted?

17:23.127 --> 17:26.077
She's off men.
She'll be nasty to him.

17:26.078 --> 17:29.078
No, no, no! He's immune to nasty.

17:29.438 --> 17:32.438
He used to work
for an energy company.

17:35.998 --> 17:38.998
Ay up,
I think I'm having a brainwave.

17:39.178 --> 17:42.178
What if I told the wife that YOU
put the stocking there as a gag?

17:42.968 --> 17:45.637
Look at me. It's me.

17:45.638 --> 17:47.478
I'm not a kamikaze pilot.

17:47.479 --> 17:49.727
Don't you think my missus
would want to know

17:49.728 --> 17:51.247
how come I had a lady's stocking?

17:51.248 --> 17:54.248
Besides, you didn't help me when
she found what looked like lipstick.

17:55.198 --> 17:58.197
Do you know why
it looked like lipstick?

17:58.198 --> 18:01.198
Because that's what it was!
You still could have helped.

18:01.359 --> 18:02.967
What was I supposed to do?

18:02.968 --> 18:05.968
You could've said you saw me stumble
against some lipstick by accident.

18:07.328 --> 18:10.328
Be honest, you thought
it were funny, me being caught.

18:11.118 --> 18:14.118
Rubbish! Just like I think
it's funny you being caught

18:14.369 --> 18:16.437
with a stocking in your pocket.

18:16.438 --> 18:18.437
But you know I'm innocent!

18:18.438 --> 18:21.438
That's why it's hilarious.

18:30.479 --> 18:32.047
I hear on the jungle telegraph that

18:32.048 --> 18:34.767
Eric was caught with
an unidentified female stocking.

18:34.768 --> 18:37.287
Mm-hm. Thrust upon him
by a stranger.

18:37.288 --> 18:40.137
As they do. Do you believe that?

18:40.138 --> 18:43.138
I'm intrigued by it
only being a single stocking.

18:43.698 --> 18:45.157
Oh, you're right!

18:45.158 --> 18:48.158
It's been my experience
that, if you're going to lose one,

18:49.078 --> 18:51.647
you're probably going to lose two.

18:51.648 --> 18:54.648
Oh, yeah. Might one ask if
that has been your experience?

18:57.048 --> 19:00.048
I don't have
your depth of experience.

19:00.148 --> 19:01.717
Oh, don't give up hope.

19:01.718 --> 19:04.718
There are solutions available.

19:08.408 --> 19:11.408
You know, Mr Newbold plays bowls
and he's a very tall person.

19:13.258 --> 19:15.207
Well, I fear for his back.

19:15.208 --> 19:18.208
Well, under your regime,
his front's not looking too happy.

19:19.288 --> 19:22.077
No, it's just
the ugly caterpillar stage

19:22.078 --> 19:24.727
before you turn them
into a butterfly.

19:24.728 --> 19:27.728
Stick insect, more like.

19:28.918 --> 19:31.918
Is the proprietor not
on the premises, Leroy?

19:32.118 --> 19:34.997
Er, back shortly, Mrs Featherstone.

19:34.998 --> 19:36.657
Well, I think we'll wait.

19:36.658 --> 19:38.478
Why should we wait?

19:38.479 --> 19:40.567
Leroy's perfectly capable.

19:40.568 --> 19:43.568
I often think that.

19:46.158 --> 19:47.847
And how are you, dear?

19:47.848 --> 19:50.697
Still mastering the skills
of single parenthood?

19:50.698 --> 19:53.007
Nearly grown up now,
Mrs Featherstone.

19:53.008 --> 19:56.008
Oh, well, I'm glad for you
and how is your daughter?

19:56.528 --> 19:58.697
Pay no attention, Mrs Hussein.

19:58.698 --> 20:01.287
Mrs Featherstone is having
early training problems

20:01.288 --> 20:03.927
with her potential fourth husband.

20:03.928 --> 20:05.797
Just teething troubles.

20:05.798 --> 20:07.567
Fourth time?

20:07.568 --> 20:10.568
You should be grateful
he's got any teeth.

20:35.078 --> 20:38.078
SHE SIGHS

20:48.078 --> 20:51.078
This way. That's it.

20:51.088 --> 20:53.777
Hold him there. No, no!

20:53.778 --> 20:56.287
My way. To me. To me.

20:56.288 --> 20:59.288
Oh!

20:59.359 --> 21:02.359
BOTH: Agh!

21:02.518 --> 21:05.368
CRACK!

21:05.369 --> 21:08.369
Oh!

21:09.648 --> 21:12.648
Now look what you've done!

21:17.288 --> 21:20.288
Looks like it's always been there.

21:21.078 --> 21:23.577
Yeah.

21:23.578 --> 21:26.578
I ought to charge him
for improvements.

21:28.418 --> 21:31.137
Gastric's only trying
to cheer you up.

21:31.138 --> 21:33.577
I'm supposed to encourage Gastric

21:33.578 --> 21:36.337
because he'd be handy
round the house?

21:36.338 --> 21:39.338
You're prepared to pimp me
to fix your boiler?

21:40.499 --> 21:43.499
You will be a bitter,
lonely, old woman.

21:46.298 --> 21:49.298
I'll give it a good try.

22:01.888 --> 22:04.567
Right, go on. Up you go.

22:04.568 --> 22:07.568
Quietly, and then,
we'll raise the mouse.

22:09.128 --> 22:11.857
And when you get up there,
put your arm around him

22:11.858 --> 22:14.858
and lean in, cheek to cheek,
and smile.

22:15.288 --> 22:18.288
That is bound to melt
the stoniest of hearts.

22:18.648 --> 22:21.277
Do I say anything? Like what?

22:21.278 --> 22:24.278
If you were to say anything,
what would you say?

22:27.728 --> 22:30.498
Oh, stop being such a misery, Madge.

22:30.499 --> 22:32.567
From me and this mouse.

22:32.568 --> 22:35.157
HE CHUCKLES

22:35.158 --> 22:37.807
Oh! Just smile, will you?

22:37.808 --> 22:40.087
Now, go on, up you go.

22:40.088 --> 22:43.087
LADDER CLATTERS
Sh! Be quiet.

22:43.088 --> 22:46.088
Go on. Remember, quietly.
Give us a hand with this mouse.

22:50.798 --> 22:52.597
Here we go.

22:52.598 --> 22:55.598
Ups-a-daisy.

23:00.608 --> 23:03.017
And don't forget,
put your arm around it.

23:03.018 --> 23:05.647
Lean in, cheek to cheek.

23:05.648 --> 23:08.648
Yeah.

23:19.968 --> 23:22.968
Argh!

23:24.018 --> 23:25.647
Oh!

23:25.648 --> 23:27.347
Don't worry, I'm all right.

23:27.348 --> 23:28.807
It broke me fall.

23:28.808 --> 23:31.167
Look what you've done to this mouse.

23:31.168 --> 23:34.168
Oh, I'm sorry
you're so upset about me(!)

23:35.298 --> 23:38.087
Somebody's going to be
coming to collect this!

23:38.088 --> 23:41.088
Thank you. Oh!

23:42.958 --> 23:45.958
Ooh!

23:48.448 --> 23:51.448
HE COUGHS

23:54.698 --> 23:56.368
It's wet through.

23:56.369 --> 23:58.447
Of course it's wet through!

23:58.448 --> 24:01.448
Your lady friend poured
a bucket of water over it.

24:01.738 --> 24:04.738
My lady friend?
I like the sound of that.

24:05.369 --> 24:07.327
I could get used to that.

24:07.328 --> 24:09.927
Right then, sir,
what are we doing for you?

24:09.928 --> 24:12.928
Backcombed, orjust a blow-dry?
Come on, Leroy!

24:13.328 --> 24:16.328
Just get it dry
before the owner comes.

24:20.138 --> 24:23.138
Oh, forget it. Forget it.
We'll never get it dry like this.

24:24.998 --> 24:27.777
We're going to have
to try and dry it naturally,

24:27.778 --> 24:29.287
you know, in the open air.

24:29.288 --> 24:32.288
Right, come on. Follow me.

24:34.239 --> 24:35.887
Push it down.

24:35.888 --> 24:38.888
Watch its head. Watch its head.

24:46.018 --> 24:47.647
Now what?

24:47.648 --> 24:50.648
Well, we've got to keep
the air moving around it.

24:51.728 --> 24:53.378
Right.

24:53.379 --> 24:56.379
To you. To me.

24:56.938 --> 24:59.857
To you.

24:59.858 --> 25:02.858
You'll put a window out.
You'll put a window out.

25:13.688 --> 25:16.688
Right. It won't work.
In my opinion, no chance.

25:17.008 --> 25:18.807
Come on, Mr Muscle.

25:18.808 --> 25:21.647
Right, get it spinning.

25:21.648 --> 25:23.447
Hey, hey, hey!

25:23.448 --> 25:26.137
Not dragging it across the floor.

25:26.138 --> 25:28.427
Who's doing this?
You. Badly! Now, come on.

25:28.428 --> 25:31.217
Get it up into the air. Right.

25:31.218 --> 25:33.097
That's it. That's it.

25:33.098 --> 25:36.098
Faster. Get it higher.

25:37.008 --> 25:40.008
Now, let out more rope,
so it gets more breeze.

25:40.888 --> 25:43.888
That's it. More rope.

25:46.098 --> 25:48.577
Oh, dear! Oh, dear!

25:48.578 --> 25:51.578
Don't worry, don't worry.
I'm all right.

25:53.048 --> 25:54.607
Is it all right?

25:54.608 --> 25:57.608
Oh, it's still soaking.

25:57.658 --> 26:00.248
It's never going to work like this.

26:00.249 --> 26:02.797
We need more air round it.

26:02.798 --> 26:05.607
We need a vehicle.

26:05.608 --> 26:08.378
I know, Gastric's Mini.

26:08.379 --> 26:10.037
Ha! Oh, yes. That's it.

26:10.038 --> 26:13.038
Come on. Lift your end. Come on.

26:15.898 --> 26:18.898
Right, Gastric, ready when you are.

26:36.138 --> 26:39.138
Well, she's getting some breeze now.

26:53.818 --> 26:56.818
TYRES SCREECH

27:03.249 --> 27:06.249
Oh, 'eck!

27:07.249 --> 27:09.457
That is a dead mouse.

27:09.458 --> 27:12.458
Right. Come on, give us a hand here.

27:15.878 --> 27:18.878
'Looks like I've bought me a mouse.

27:19.658 --> 27:22.658
'You wouldn't have liked
living with him anyway.

27:26.138 --> 27:29.138
'It's a good job I got a reduction
on account of your condition.'

27:40.168 --> 27:42.047
Madge has got a dripping tap.

27:42.048 --> 27:44.727
Note who she turns to
in an emergency?

27:44.728 --> 27:47.728
THEY LAUGH

27:50.728 --> 27:53.657
Go on. Say it.

27:53.658 --> 27:55.177
Hello, Granville.

27:55.178 --> 27:56.807
Oh!

27:56.808 --> 27:58.807
Gets me every time.

27:58.808 --> 28:00.687
It's like music.

28:00.688 --> 28:03.688
Fish and chips? Mm-hm!
Madge is busy with a dripping tap.

28:04.318 --> 28:06.167
Oh!

28:06.168 --> 28:09.168
Can you help me
get the mouse inside? Mm—hm.

28:09.218 --> 28:12.218
How come she's suddenly
got a dripping tap?

28:12.259 --> 28:13.499
It wasn't as hard as I thought.
