WEBVTT

00:14.639 --> 00:15.932
Skadoosh.

00:42.625 --> 00:44.335
-Alfie!

00:47.297 --> 00:50.049
Alfie!

00:50.633 --> 00:52.427
Stupid dress.

00:52.510 --> 00:55.847
Lulu! Shouldn't you be
in your manners class?

00:56.765 --> 00:59.976
I don't want dresses and fork school.

01:00.060 --> 01:02.937
I want a sword, and a mission.

01:03.521 --> 01:05.732
Enjoy being a kid while you can.

01:05.815 --> 01:07.525
I've been a kid for eight years.

01:07.609 --> 01:10.111
I want to be a knight, like you.

01:13.573 --> 01:17.035
Lulu, Mom and Dad
would never let you become a knight.

01:17.118 --> 01:19.079
It's too dangerous.

01:31.925 --> 01:34.177
Sand fight!

01:35.261 --> 01:36.763
Throw another sand ball at me

01:36.846 --> 01:39.516
and I'll use your shoulder blade
to scoop out your spleen.

01:39.599 --> 01:43.019
-Okay, not a fan of sand fights.

01:43.645 --> 01:44.938
But what about this?

01:45.605 --> 01:47.065
Look, it's you and me!

01:49.234 --> 01:50.819
That looks nothing like me.

02:03.414 --> 02:05.416
We have a Lost City to find.

02:40.034 --> 02:42.662
I want to know
where those bears were headed.

02:43.621 --> 02:44.455
Why?

02:45.165 --> 02:46.499
That doesn't concern you.

02:46.583 --> 02:47.625
Why?

02:47.709 --> 02:49.669
-Because you're a child!
-Why?

02:51.087 --> 02:53.089
Let's try this another way.

02:55.592 --> 02:59.095
-Where were the two bears headed?

02:59.178 --> 03:01.931
Rabi,
I really think you should tell him.

03:12.817 --> 03:15.904
What is this?

03:17.447 --> 03:19.741
It'll get you there.

03:37.926 --> 03:40.470
I thought stairs were bad.

03:46.309 --> 03:47.685
You want some grapes?

03:52.690 --> 03:54.817
Want some… raisins?

03:55.485 --> 03:56.486
I'll pass.

03:57.779 --> 03:59.656
Your loss. They're nature's…

04:01.824 --> 04:02.742
…candy.

04:09.082 --> 04:12.252
So, uh, what do you think
about taking a little, you know…

04:12.794 --> 04:14.003
breakski?

04:14.087 --> 04:17.423
Absolutely not.
Klaus and Veruca know we're on to them.

04:17.507 --> 04:20.260
They're surely trying to
find and kill us as we speak.

04:20.343 --> 04:22.595
Ah! Why does everyone wanna kill us?

04:22.679 --> 04:25.181
Klaus and Veruca, that weird cloak-y guy…

04:25.265 --> 04:26.975
-Those vultures.

04:27.058 --> 04:30.687
Oh no, we're not gonna kill you.
We're just gonna wait for you to die.

04:33.189 --> 04:35.858
Oh, we're no match
for the power of the gauntlet,

04:35.942 --> 04:38.319
but the Whip of Endless Flame could be.

04:38.403 --> 04:42.615
If we beat them to the Lost City,
we could use the whip to fight back.

04:42.699 --> 04:44.117
So step it up.

04:44.200 --> 04:45.994
Okay, I'm hearing some self-doubt.

04:46.577 --> 04:48.955
Knights don't have doubt.

04:55.712 --> 04:57.422
Look, Master Oogway used to say,

04:57.505 --> 05:00.008
"If you take a break,
you can sit with your feelings--"

05:00.091 --> 05:01.509
Knights don't have feelings.

05:01.592 --> 05:04.721
And conserve energy during the day
so we can "step it up"

05:04.804 --> 05:08.599
and travel more efficiently
in the cool night air. Huh? Huh?

05:08.683 --> 05:10.977
How about we agree--

05:11.060 --> 05:14.105
Yes! 'Cause we're a team, and teams agree.

05:14.188 --> 05:15.940
…that your plan is wrong.

05:16.024 --> 05:18.276
Wow, that took a hard left.

05:18.359 --> 05:21.446
Look around, Po. The situation is dire.

05:22.030 --> 05:24.741
The situation is dire.

05:25.325 --> 05:26.284
Dire?

05:26.868 --> 05:30.121
Yes. It seems
I've graduated to spoon school.

05:30.204 --> 05:32.040
I can't do this anymore.

05:32.123 --> 05:34.125
You must train me, please.

05:36.836 --> 05:37.712
Hm.

05:45.094 --> 05:47.555
A knight's true strength
comes from their mind.

05:47.638 --> 05:49.098
Are you smart enough?

05:50.016 --> 05:52.018
I am so smart enough.

05:52.101 --> 05:55.104
Alright. Fetch me
two buckets of water from the well.

05:55.646 --> 05:57.648
Without touching the pails.

05:58.399 --> 05:59.233
Hm.

06:03.988 --> 06:06.407
Whoa!

06:20.213 --> 06:22.965
This is impossible!

06:23.049 --> 06:25.009
Don't fret too much.

06:25.093 --> 06:27.804
Knights older than you
have failed at this juncture.

06:27.887 --> 06:30.348
I am not gonna be a failure.

06:46.697 --> 06:47.532
Huh?

06:56.624 --> 06:59.544
-Take a sip of… Mm!

07:02.380 --> 07:03.381
Hm…

07:04.507 --> 07:05.716
Ahoy!

07:07.093 --> 07:09.178
This isn't a time to play around.

07:09.262 --> 07:11.055
I wasn't playing around.

07:11.139 --> 07:14.016
I was using the hill
to conserve my energy.

07:14.100 --> 07:16.352
-Plus, fun!

07:16.436 --> 07:19.397
I know, I know. Knights don't do fun.

07:20.189 --> 07:21.023
Hm.

07:27.780 --> 07:29.449
Don't even think about it.

07:29.532 --> 07:31.826
Nah, it's cool. I got all day.

07:32.702 --> 07:35.872
I just feel like
you're kinda, really effort-ing.

07:35.955 --> 07:37.665
Effort-ing? Is that a word?

07:37.748 --> 07:40.293
Master Shifu used to
say that to me all the time.

07:40.376 --> 07:43.171
But if that doesn't work for you,
I got oodles of sayings.

07:45.214 --> 07:48.676
"Try surrendering to what is."
Master Dolphin.

07:48.759 --> 07:50.511
"The obstacle is the path."

07:50.595 --> 07:52.180
-Master Oogway.

07:52.263 --> 07:54.557
"Po,
if you relax, it'll pass faster."

07:54.640 --> 07:55.892
My doctor.

07:55.975 --> 07:59.270
Surrender to the obstacle is the path?

07:59.353 --> 08:00.855
Nonsense.

08:00.938 --> 08:02.482
It's not nonsense.

08:02.565 --> 08:06.194
It's wisdom, passed down through the eons.

08:06.277 --> 08:08.321
Eons, eons…

08:09.614 --> 08:10.740
Care to join?

08:10.823 --> 08:13.826
I'd rather reach down my throat
and twist up my trachea.

08:14.410 --> 08:16.621
Man, you know a lot about anatomy.

08:16.704 --> 08:18.873
Is it-- Did you study that, or…?

08:20.666 --> 08:24.378
Mm-kay. More fun for me!

08:30.009 --> 08:32.553
I can't go on.

08:32.637 --> 08:36.057
-Gotta… take a break.

08:36.140 --> 08:39.393
-No. Just a little fur…

08:39.477 --> 08:40.978
Here.

08:41.687 --> 08:43.981
Right here.

09:09.048 --> 09:10.508
Let me get this straight.

09:10.591 --> 09:13.594
We're following
this dashing death machine on legs

09:13.678 --> 09:14.845
because, uh…

09:14.929 --> 09:18.391
For the fifth time,
those bears know where the whip is,

09:18.474 --> 09:20.601
and he knows where to find the bears.

09:20.685 --> 09:21.686
Keep up!

09:32.405 --> 09:35.074
Hm… I thought
you would have different stars here,

09:35.157 --> 09:37.535
but that's Ursa Major and Ursa Minor.

09:37.618 --> 09:39.662
You mean
Big Noodle Pot, Little Noodle Pot?

09:39.745 --> 09:43.291
No. Assuming your father called it that
because he makes noodles.

09:43.874 --> 09:45.793
No, that's what everyone calls it.

09:45.876 --> 09:47.753
You just made up fake words.

09:47.837 --> 09:49.422
Ursa?

09:49.505 --> 09:51.173
What's Ursa?

09:51.257 --> 09:53.384
Ursa Major means "Great Bear."

09:53.467 --> 09:54.802
Ursa is Latin.

09:54.885 --> 09:57.096
Latin? Who speaks Latin?

09:57.179 --> 09:58.931
I do!

09:59.015 --> 10:01.976
I give up. We've been speaking
different languages all day.

10:02.059 --> 10:03.436
I won't teach you another.

10:05.479 --> 10:08.524
Ursa Major… Ursa Major…

10:08.608 --> 10:10.443
Pretty cool catchphrase, though.

10:10.526 --> 10:14.071
"Look out! Ursa Major!" Boom.

10:14.614 --> 10:15.615
Quiet.

10:16.866 --> 10:18.159
Right, right.

10:18.242 --> 10:20.536
That reminds me actually, of a saying:

10:20.620 --> 10:23.914
"Holding on to anger
is letting anger hold on to you."

10:23.998 --> 10:24.999
Enough!

10:41.766 --> 10:43.601
Hm…

10:48.022 --> 10:49.023
Oi!

10:49.690 --> 10:53.235
She said I'd get a gold piece.
From you. Pay up.

11:01.327 --> 11:04.288
That's
the easiest coin I ever made.

11:06.123 --> 11:08.334
Papa's going straight to the racetrack.

11:12.088 --> 11:14.382
There's just one more challenge.

11:21.013 --> 11:21.847
Hm.

11:21.931 --> 11:25.184
By all accounts,
we should be right on top of the city.

11:27.353 --> 11:30.481
There's the Red Sand Mine,
the Weird Shaped Bush…

11:31.065 --> 11:34.110
-The Rock with Too Many Faces.
-Ugh, definitely too many.

11:34.193 --> 11:35.319
The Blurry Mound…

11:35.403 --> 11:37.905
Is that the Blurry Mound?
It's hard to tell.

11:37.988 --> 11:40.950
The Lone Tree of Rejection.
The Other Lone Tree of Rejection.

11:41.033 --> 11:42.618
I feel you, buddy.

11:43.327 --> 11:46.497
Everything is where it's supposed to be
according to the map,

11:46.580 --> 11:48.666
so why can't we find the Lost City?

11:54.338 --> 11:57.425
Well, you know
what Master Eel used to say.

11:57.967 --> 12:00.177
"Fall backwards
and trust the river of life."

12:00.261 --> 12:02.471
-What?

12:03.806 --> 12:08.018
"The more you try to control something,
the more it controls you." Master Wombat.

12:08.102 --> 12:09.311
Meaningless!

12:09.395 --> 12:13.941
"Meaning is in the eye of the beholder."
Some guy trying to sell me a painting.

12:14.024 --> 12:16.777
Do you really think
we can just ask the universe

12:16.861 --> 12:19.071
and the city will appear right here?

12:23.951 --> 12:24.869
Mm?

12:26.036 --> 12:28.038
-Huh?

12:31.041 --> 12:33.919
-Don't say a word.

12:42.845 --> 12:45.848
What do we do when he gets them bears, eh?
What do we do?

12:45.931 --> 12:47.558
-Stealth, Veruca.

12:47.641 --> 12:49.602
That means be quiet.

12:49.685 --> 12:50.686
What do we do?

12:50.769 --> 12:52.688
Do we kill him, or them,

12:52.771 --> 12:54.273
or all three, three, three?

12:54.356 --> 12:57.276
At this point,
my vote is kill me.

13:01.739 --> 13:02.740
Where'd he go?

13:05.451 --> 13:09.580
Did you hear me,
or the cacophonous rantings of my sister?

13:11.290 --> 13:13.626
Both of you. The whole time.

13:13.709 --> 13:14.793
Let him go.

13:16.795 --> 13:20.216
Or find out what I can do
with this pretty thing.

13:21.550 --> 13:23.552
How about we strike a deal?

13:23.636 --> 13:27.723
We'll help you get those bears
if you share the map.

13:27.806 --> 13:31.310
If you don't want the bears,
what do you want with the map?

13:31.393 --> 13:32.394
Doesn't matter.

13:33.312 --> 13:34.647
Do we have a deal?

13:34.730 --> 13:35.940
Mm…

13:36.023 --> 13:40.069
-I said, do we have a deal?

13:47.076 --> 13:48.494
I hold the map.

13:48.994 --> 13:50.287
But you can follow.

13:51.914 --> 13:55.167
He's definitely going first,
then the bears.

13:55.668 --> 13:58.879
Then you, if you like.

13:58.963 --> 14:00.506
Oh, shut it already!

14:02.591 --> 14:04.385
How did we not see this before?

14:04.468 --> 14:08.305
"Everything unfolds
as it's supposed to." Master Spider.

14:08.389 --> 14:11.267
"Sometimes the answer appears
when you stop looking for it."

14:11.350 --> 14:13.310
The bathroom stall at my dad's restaurant.

14:14.311 --> 14:17.273
Or, maybe it's magic!

14:17.773 --> 14:20.901
Well, magic or not,
this doesn't look like much of a city.

14:20.985 --> 14:24.405
Maybe this is all that's left.
I mean, it's probably super old.

14:24.488 --> 14:26.824
Maybe somebody took the whip already.

14:26.907 --> 14:29.118
Or maybe it was never here.

14:29.201 --> 14:30.244
We'll keep looking.

14:30.327 --> 14:34.081
There's gotta be a secret door,
or a ladder made of bones, or something.

14:40.838 --> 14:43.299
Uh, did that rock just yell at me?

15:12.745 --> 15:15.122
Okay, that's definitely magic.

15:48.238 --> 15:50.366
Oh, no, no, no!

15:53.786 --> 15:55.663
-I can't get out.

16:14.181 --> 16:15.516
How'd you like that?

16:15.599 --> 16:17.893
I don't think
it liked that at all.

16:44.795 --> 16:46.797
Get your rocky hands off me!

16:46.880 --> 16:49.800
-Blade!

16:50.801 --> 16:53.429
This adds
a whole new meaning to "thumb war."

16:53.512 --> 16:55.931
Po! Take this seriously.

16:57.808 --> 17:00.769
He's guarding something,
but there's no city.

17:09.403 --> 17:12.489
"The obstacle is the path."

17:12.573 --> 17:13.949
Blade!

17:14.033 --> 17:18.328
The monster isn’t guarding the city,
the monster is the city!

17:18.412 --> 17:20.247
What are you talking about?

17:23.667 --> 17:26.003
-Hey, Giant Rock Monster!

17:26.086 --> 17:30.090
Hope you skipped breakfast,
'cause you're about to have a big lunch.

17:30.174 --> 17:34.511
-Po, what are you doing?
-Trust me, I got this!

17:34.595 --> 17:36.638
I'm delicious, I promise!

17:36.722 --> 17:38.766
I'm very well-marbled.

17:39.266 --> 17:42.227
Po, do not climb in this monster's mouth!

17:43.979 --> 17:47.775
"Fall backwards
and trust the river of life…"

17:48.776 --> 17:50.778
-Po!

18:03.999 --> 18:05.751
Whoa!

18:10.631 --> 18:14.968
Oh, come on! Open up!
I'm not as bitter as I seem.

18:16.637 --> 18:18.806
I'm not strong enough. I'm scared!

18:20.224 --> 18:23.352
Your final challenge is
to fetch yourself out of this well.

18:24.436 --> 18:27.773
I'm not strong enough. I'm scared!

18:27.856 --> 18:30.567
You can do this! I know you can.

18:57.136 --> 18:59.304
I did it! I can't believe I did it!

18:59.972 --> 19:02.599
Lulu, remember this:

19:03.183 --> 19:04.852
the only way out…

19:06.186 --> 19:07.396
Is through.

19:12.151 --> 19:16.071
The obstacle is
the path, path, path…

19:17.698 --> 19:20.409
Alright, Po. We'll do it your way.

19:53.901 --> 19:55.027
Blade!

19:56.570 --> 19:58.155
You came after me!

19:58.238 --> 19:59.740
Yes, I…

19:59.823 --> 20:02.075
I couldn't let you get eaten by yourself.

20:02.784 --> 20:05.829
Ah, shoot.
Wasn't that esophagus slide fun?

20:07.706 --> 20:10.584
-Ursa Major!

20:18.717 --> 20:22.679
Who would have thought?
A city inside a monster. Hm.

20:23.430 --> 20:26.433
Probably super safe to raise kids in here.

20:34.191 --> 20:36.777
Looks like
no one has lived here for centuries.

20:47.996 --> 20:51.166
Oh my gosh! Is that the whip?

20:55.504 --> 20:56.505
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

20:57.005 --> 20:59.007
This place is built to protect this whip.

20:59.091 --> 21:00.550
No way it's just sitting here.

21:00.634 --> 21:04.096
As soon as we grab it, there's gonna be
flying arrows, the floor'll drop out…

21:04.179 --> 21:07.224
This whole place will crumble!
We're just gonna have to run for it.

21:07.307 --> 21:08.558
How do you know that?

21:08.642 --> 21:11.395
You know,
standard treasure-grabbing protocol.

21:12.229 --> 21:13.063
Alright.

21:16.608 --> 21:17.442
I'm ready.

21:36.295 --> 21:37.296
Nervous eater.

22:02.654 --> 22:03.488
Huh.

22:03.572 --> 22:06.867
I guess this treasure
doesn't know the protocol.

22:06.950 --> 22:08.201
No traps.

22:13.248 --> 22:15.083
There are no traps!

22:15.167 --> 22:20.839
But there is something far worse
for those who wish to wield the whip.

22:22.758 --> 22:24.009
Me!
