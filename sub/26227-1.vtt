02:02.997 --> 02:04.332
[woman] Like most black mothers,

02:04.415 --> 02:07.710
mine was consumed
by the presentation of her child.

02:10.588 --> 02:12.841
I was a reflection of her as a mother.

02:16.636 --> 02:19.055
It was an ever-present source of anxiety

02:19.139 --> 02:23.226
to prove that I was just as well-groomed
as any white child.

02:23.309 --> 02:27.856
They would play, hair uncombed, no shoes,

02:27.939 --> 02:30.984

smeared on their faces,

02:31.568 --> 02:33.444
completely happy and oblivious

02:33.528 --> 02:36.322
to any possible defects
to their appearance.

02:36.865 --> 02:39.534
I, on the other hand, had to be fixed.

02:40.535 --> 02:44.080
Once a week:
wash, conditioner, and hot comb,

02:44.164 --> 02:46.583
until my hair was straight enough
to run her fingers through it

02:46.666 --> 02:49.460
without one snap, crackle, or pop.

02:49.544 --> 02:50.378
Ow!

02:50.461 --> 02:52.380
That's your outside voice, Violet.

02:52.463 --> 02:55.592
-But you're burning my head off.
-No one likes a complainer.

02:55.884 --> 02:59.262
-[Violet] Only then was I perfect.
-Hey, baby girl.

03:01.264 --> 03:03.433
You deserve the world,

03:03.516 --> 03:06.060
and one day, you're gonna find a man
who'll give it to you.

03:06.144 --> 03:07.520
Like my daddy.

03:08.229 --> 03:12.358
No, Vi. There's not a man in the world
who can give your mommy what she wants.

03:12.984 --> 03:17.155

perfection was no fun.

[chuckles]

13:28.015 --> 13:31.393
Make yourself useful.
Go get Crystal some conditioner, okay?

13:31.894 --> 13:34.313
Girl, she does whatever flies
into her head.

13:34.730 --> 13:37.066
My mama would have popped me good
for running my mouth

13:37.149 --> 13:39.109
-and having hair looking that crazy.
-Mm-hmm.

13:39.193 --> 13:41.111
Come on, let's get you washed up.

13:47.451 --> 13:49.161
[exhales, groans]

13:51.372 --> 13:52.373
You okay?

13:52.832 --> 13:53.791
I'm fine.

13:56.961 --> 13:57.878
[exhales]

14:00.130 --> 14:02.341
[panting]

14:05.386 --> 14:08.681
Uh, excuse me, I need to be rinsed.

14:09.265 --> 14:11.475
You have seven more minutes to condition.

14:15.771 --> 14:17.022
Now, please!

14:18.399 --> 14:21.193
Oh, God, thank you. [pants]

14:28.117 --> 14:29.159

14:30.452 --> 14:31.829

-[woman 2] Uh-uh!

14:31.912 --> 14:34.373
-[mouthing silently]
-[woman 3] Oh, my goodness.

14:34.456 --> 14:35.833
Oh, shit.

14:36.584 --> 14:37.418
-What?
-[gasps]

14:38.252 --> 14:40.254
[screams] Oh, my God!

14:42.923 --> 14:45.551
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

14:45.634 --> 14:47.303
Okay, all right. Vi, calm down.

14:47.386 --> 14:50.264
All right, it's really not that bad,
you know. We could comb it over.

14:50.347 --> 14:52.683
-What happened?
-I-- I just washed and conditioned her.

14:55.144 --> 14:57.021
-You used relaxer.
-What?

14:57.104 --> 14:58.856
I used what Zoe handed me.

14:59.356 --> 15:00.399
You!

15:00.774 --> 15:02.026
You did this!

15:02.109 --> 15:04.486
-Whoa, whoa, whoa! Mistakes happen.
-This was no mistake!

15:04.570 --> 15:06.864
-Where the hell is her mother?
-Her mother's not around.

15:06.947 --> 15:08.365
She's my daughter,
I take responsibility.

15:08.449 --> 15:10.534
That's your daughter?
With that mop on her head?

15:10.618 --> 15:12.328
[man] I am sorry this happened,

15:12.411 --> 15:14.038
but don't talk
about my daughter like that.

15:14.121 --> 15:16.290
[Violet] But? No, no, no, no, no.
There is no "but."

15:16.373 --> 15:18.542
You can think whatever you want
about me right now,

15:18.626 --> 15:21.962
but in a few hours,
my man will be proposing to me,

15:22.046 --> 15:24.965
so I suggest you go
to one of those thousand hair supplies

15:25.049 --> 15:27.551
on this block
and buy me the best hair money can buy,

15:27.635 --> 15:30.679
and figure out a way
to attach it to my head! [sobs]

15:33.307 --> 15:35.309

you're still doing her hair.

-She looks gorgeous.

16:01.293 --> 16:03.337
Your grandmother hated doing
your mom's hair.

16:04.338 --> 16:07.216
She used to just send her outside
with this... afro.

16:07.841 --> 16:11.011
The boys on the block
used to call her Willie Mays.

16:11.095 --> 16:13.347

16:22.648 --> 16:25.359
Thanks, Dad. Wait, you're not leaving.

16:25.442 --> 16:27.027
Clint's going to, um...

16:28.153 --> 16:29.154
uh, make a toast,

16:29.238 --> 16:30.990
and I really want you here.

16:31.073 --> 16:32.992
Well, I have an early call tomorrow.

16:33.075 --> 16:35.369
I just booked my first job:
a big photo shoot.

16:35.452 --> 16:36.954
Oh, excellent!

16:37.955 --> 16:40.416
This is all still a little weird for me.

16:40.833 --> 16:43.127
Hey, enjoy your party.

16:43.210 --> 16:44.169
-Thanks, Dad.
-Love you.

-[chuckles softly]
-[clears throat]

17:12.573 --> 17:18.620
So, I've been asking myself,
what do you get the perfect woman?

17:18.704 --> 17:19.872
[guests chuckle softly]

17:19.955 --> 17:23.292
You are as beautiful
waking up in the morning

17:23.500 --> 17:26.170
-as you are at night.
-[Violet chuckles] No, I'm not.

17:26.253 --> 17:28.047
It's unnatural how perfect.

17:28.130 --> 17:29.089
[both laugh]

17:29.298 --> 17:34.553
So, I kept coming back
to that sense of... family.

17:36.305 --> 17:38.307
[gasps] Oh!

17:39.725 --> 17:40.809
[Violet] Oh, Clint.

Oh, this is the happiest moment
of my life.

And one that won't make a mess.

18:24.895 --> 18:27.147
-[Lola whimpers]
-He got me a dog.

18:27.606 --> 18:28.732

18:28.816 --> 18:30.067
[friend 2] Oh, Vi.

18:30.943 --> 18:32.861
There's nothing wrong with you.

18:33.737 --> 18:36.281
Clint didn't propose tonight, but he will.

18:36.365 --> 18:37.908
-[sighs]
-Soon.

18:39.076 --> 18:41.286
Now freshen up, pick up that mutt,

18:41.370 --> 18:43.789

No, absolutely nothing happened
at the party.

What's that supposed to mean?

19:24.705 --> 19:26.707
I was expecting a ring, Clint.

A ring?

19:29.585 --> 19:30.794
Like an engagement ring?

Yes!

19:31.920 --> 19:33.380

19:33.463 --> 19:36.592
Why? We've been together two years.

Of course you do!

but you never let your hair down.

of course.

all women are pretty,

24:38.059 --> 24:42.439
but you won't be perfect
until you wear Long Live Red?

24:42.939 --> 24:43.815
Yes.

24:45.066 --> 24:45.901
No.

24:46.568 --> 24:47.736

'Cause that wouldn't be nice,
or even fair, to call her perfect.

I mean, she's beautiful,
but she's much more than that.

24:55.911 --> 24:58.288
Much, much more than that.

24:58.371 --> 25:01.833
Fine. Then she's in Phi Beta Kappa
as well.

-Right?
-No, no, no, no, Bill.

25:03.543 --> 25:05.962
I don't--
I don't think you're really seeing her.

She is, um, way, way, way, way more
than that.

25:10.217 --> 25:13.678

and that's really the point of the ad.

and put it on the counter.

to set off the alarm first,

40:45.109 --> 40:46.235
Thanks for coming.

40:46.444 --> 40:50.364
Vi, you really shouldn't be calling me
for things like this anymore.

40:50.448 --> 40:53.409
Come on, Dad, do you even remember
what you were angry at her about?

40:53.492 --> 40:55.536
[scoffs] Yes.

40:56.787 --> 40:58.247
Well, what if I need you?

41:00.499 --> 41:01.584
[crying] Look at me.

41:08.048 --> 41:10.634
It just shows off more
of your pretty face.

41:11.385 --> 41:14.346
I've worked so hard
to be everything he wanted.

41:15.598 --> 41:17.183
And it still wasn't enough.

41:19.435 --> 41:21.020
I'm so tired.

41:22.313 --> 41:24.899
Of course you're tired, baby girl.

41:27.109 --> 41:30.070
Look, you think...

41:31.197 --> 41:33.449
that this is just something
you did on a whim?

41:34.241 --> 41:36.035
I think you've been building up to it.

41:36.118 --> 41:39.580
Now, I understand what you're going
through probably better than anyone.

41:39.663 --> 41:40.623
And you know what?

41:41.248 --> 41:42.458
You gonna be okay.

41:42.875 --> 41:44.251
We'll get this cleaned up.

41:44.502 --> 41:46.212
You've just gotta soldier on.

41:47.171 --> 41:50.674
And, look, you've got the head for it.

41:50.966 --> 41:52.968
[both chuckle]

42:18.077 --> 42:19.703
[sobs]

42:20.287 --> 42:21.872
[knocking on door]

42:24.959 --> 42:27.503
[woman] Sorry, but I--
I really need to get in there.

42:27.711 --> 42:30.089
[sighs] Can you just use...

42:30.673 --> 42:32.841
Can you just use the men's room, please?

42:32.925 --> 42:34.677
[woman] I'd really prefer not to.

42:36.554 --> 42:40.975
Look, there are six women to every man
waiting to use a public restroom,

42:41.058 --> 42:43.060
so there's an excellent chance
that it will be empty.

42:43.143 --> 42:44.895
Just leave me the hell alone.

42:46.522 --> 42:49.233
[woman sobbing]

42:58.826 --> 43:01.537
Sorry! Sorry, no, this isn't your fault.

43:01.745 --> 43:05.249
No. [stammers] I apologize. I-- [sniffles]

43:05.583 --> 43:07.376
I was incredibly rude.

43:09.420 --> 43:10.379
I'm sorry.

43:11.463 --> 43:12.631
That's a pretty scarf.

43:12.798 --> 43:14.216
[chuckles] Thanks.

43:14.592 --> 43:17.094
I am just so emotional lately.

43:17.177 --> 43:19.054
Well, if it means anything, I--

43:19.305 --> 43:23.726
I thought I was gonna be engaged...
last week.

43:25.060 --> 43:26.562
And I'm supposed to be at work today,

43:26.645 --> 43:29.106
and all I want to do is curl up
under the covers.

43:29.607 --> 43:30.899
[woman] So do it.

43:31.150 --> 43:32.192
I can't. [chuckles]

43:33.235 --> 43:36.030
[woman] Hey,
you should really come to my group.

43:36.989 --> 43:41.410
Oh, no, I'm not one to tell
my personal business to strangers.

43:41.535 --> 43:44.413
[chuckles] Well, I'm a stranger,
and you're talking to me.

43:45.122 --> 43:46.624
No, what can it hurt, right?

43:51.128 --> 43:52.212
There you go.

43:53.339 --> 43:54.632
-Thanks.
-[woman] Yeah.

43:56.216 --> 43:59.219
[woman 2] He said that
he couldn't handle us anymore.

43:59.720 --> 44:00.929
Handle it.

44:01.597 --> 44:04.850
He's in the middle of dumping me,
and at the same time,

44:04.933 --> 44:08.228
he's scared about how I'm gonna react.

44:08.687 --> 44:12.691
Am I gonna lose it,
find a bridge, jump off?

44:13.233 --> 44:17.154
I say, "Baby, please, I've lost my job,

44:18.113 --> 44:19.782
I've lost my hair,

44:20.824 --> 44:25.287
I've lost my $1,200 implants
in my left breast.

44:26.080 --> 44:31.168
If I can get over cancer,
then I can get over your simple ass."

44:37.341 --> 44:39.051
You don't have to do that.

44:39.635 --> 44:40.678
Sneak out.

44:43.222 --> 44:44.223
I'm Erika.

44:45.307 --> 44:48.435
You're new,
but you have a right to speak up.

44:48.769 --> 44:51.397
No, I... I really don't.

44:51.480 --> 44:54.733
-Violet, it's okay.
-No, it's-- it's-- it's not.

44:58.779 --> 44:59.697
I... um...

45:00.948 --> 45:01.907
[chuckles softly]

45:04.952 --> 45:10.708
My boyfriend didn't give me a ring,
and so, uh... I shaved my hair off.

45:13.210 --> 45:19.174
You guys are incredible, to be dealing
with everything you're dealing with

45:19.258 --> 45:24.096
and still to have the courage
to... to not feel sorry for yourselves.

45:26.807 --> 45:29.601
I am so sorry for the misunderstanding.

45:33.313 --> 45:37.401
The first thing I asked my doctor when
he told me I was gonna have to have chemo

45:37.484 --> 45:40.112
was, "Am I gonna lose my hair?"

45:40.195 --> 45:41.947
-Right?
-[women] Mm-hmm.

45:42.239 --> 45:44.575
So, let's see.

45:58.881 --> 46:00.591
[chuckles] Shit!

46:01.467 --> 46:04.762
You walk around like that,
of course you're gonna get ignored.

46:04.845 --> 46:06.847
[women chuckle]

46:07.097 --> 46:09.057
You gotta own it, girl.

46:09.516 --> 46:10.517
Own it.

46:15.314 --> 46:17.232
-[man] All right.
-[indistinct chatter]

46:25.532 --> 46:27.743
-Wow!
-You go, girl.

46:36.710 --> 46:39.922
In my six years here,
I've got every account I've gone after.

46:40.881 --> 46:43.592
And, despite what happened,
that includes Essential.

46:43.675 --> 46:44.802
I deserve a shot.

46:44.885 --> 46:48.806
Yeah, Violet, you're my go-to girl
for beauty accounts.

46:48.889 --> 46:50.265
I mean, that's your thing.

46:50.474 --> 46:54.228
And you were g-- You are great at it.

46:54.645 --> 46:57.689
Well, let me prove I can be great
at something else.

46:58.607 --> 46:59.817
I want Amber Lite.

47:00.984 --> 47:01.944
[chuckles]

47:02.903 --> 47:07.908
Well, no offense, dear, but this is...
That's the granddaddy.

47:09.368 --> 47:13.038
You know,
when I said to get your head right,

47:13.121 --> 47:15.082
this isn't really what I had in mind.

47:15.624 --> 47:17.835
Are you sure that
you don't need more time?

47:17.918 --> 47:19.378
Bill, I am fine.

47:20.629 --> 47:24.633
I just don't want anything that
has to do with beauty right now.

47:25.592 --> 47:26.510
Please.

47:27.177 --> 47:28.136
[sighs]

47:33.475 --> 47:34.476
Fine.

47:34.560 --> 47:37.437
-[chuckles]
-Okay. I will give you this shot.

47:38.188 --> 47:42.734
But if I am not blown away
by what you come up with,

47:43.443 --> 47:46.154
then we go back to the old Violet.
All the way back.

47:46.697 --> 47:48.073
-Deal?
-Deal.

47:48.282 --> 47:49.116
All right.

47:49.700 --> 47:52.160
-[friend 2 exclaims]
-So soft!

47:52.244 --> 47:54.121
Oh, my gosh.

47:54.204 --> 47:57.416
Vi, I thought Common made bald sexy,
but he ain't got nothin' on you.

47:57.499 --> 47:59.251
-You like it?
-Yes, you look so good!

47:59.334 --> 48:00.419
-You look bomb.
-Really?

48:00.502 --> 48:02.004
-Beautiful.
-[friend 2] Mm-hmm.

48:02.546 --> 48:04.756
-[sighs]
-So, what's it like?

48:05.299 --> 48:07.885
Waking up in the morning
and not having to worry about your hair.

48:07.968 --> 48:08.802
Yes.

48:08.886 --> 48:11.471
I am so used to looking
at myself in the mirror all the time,

48:11.555 --> 48:12.389
and now I never do.

48:12.472 --> 48:17.853
It's only when I catch somebody's reaction
that it all comes back.

48:18.979 --> 48:21.690
But we are not here to talk about hair.

48:21.773 --> 48:24.318
Y'all are here to help me
come up with a beer commercial.

48:24.401 --> 48:25.485
Okay.

48:25.569 --> 48:26.612
Now, look around.

48:27.362 --> 48:28.322
What do you see?

48:28.447 --> 48:31.116
Uh... Guys drinking.

48:31.199 --> 48:33.076
-[man] Go! Go!
-[all cheer]

48:33.452 --> 48:35.120
-Yay! [laughs]
-[friend 2] Yeah.

48:35.203 --> 48:37.080
Yeah, guys screaming at the TV.

48:37.789 --> 48:40.667
-Latent homosexuality.
-[laughs]

48:41.418 --> 48:44.212
You know, I hate beer commercials,
to be honest.

48:44.296 --> 48:46.006
I mean, they're so sexist.

48:46.632 --> 48:48.050
Do something different, Vi.

48:48.258 --> 48:49.927
Yes. Hear, hear.

48:50.010 --> 48:50.844
Right?

48:51.386 --> 48:52.429
Hmm...

49:18.956 --> 49:19.998
[chuckles]

49:21.875 --> 49:23.502
[clicks tongue, sighs]

49:39.810 --> 49:41.103
Hello, Zoe.

49:44.106 --> 49:47.484
Is that my fault too?
'Cause it doesn't look bad. I mean...

49:47.859 --> 49:49.736
you don't have any dents or nothin'.

49:49.820 --> 49:51.071
No. [chuckles]

49:51.822 --> 49:53.949
I brought you a birthday present.

49:54.783 --> 49:56.493
My birthday isn't for two weeks.

49:56.576 --> 49:58.870
Okay. Never mind. I'll just return it.

49:59.371 --> 50:00.831
I actually have the receipt.

50:01.415 --> 50:02.249
Wait.

50:10.298 --> 50:11.800
Why would you get this for me?

50:11.883 --> 50:13.093
'Cause I felt like it.

50:16.179 --> 50:17.180
Try it on.

50:21.268 --> 50:25.313
Zoe, you look beautiful. [gasps]

50:25.480 --> 50:28.692
Yeah, right,
except for my body and my hair.

50:29.860 --> 50:31.069
Why would you say that?

50:31.445 --> 50:32.612
You did.

50:34.322 --> 50:38.368
Zoe, don't ever let someone's negative
opinion of you become your reality.

50:38.994 --> 50:41.079
You are a beautiful girl.

50:41.163 --> 50:42.581
You just need a few tips.

50:43.081 --> 50:44.666
My dad won't let me perm my hair.

50:44.750 --> 50:46.835
He says the chemicals
go right to your brain.

50:46.918 --> 50:48.503
You don't need to do that.

50:49.212 --> 50:51.298
Now, just walk across the porch.

50:57.012 --> 50:58.096
Okay, stop.

50:58.638 --> 51:00.307
See how your right foot is angled out?

51:00.974 --> 51:03.101
Try to walk with your feet straighter.

51:04.895 --> 51:06.104
Stand up straighter.

51:06.646 --> 51:07.689
Hold your head up.

51:07.856 --> 51:09.983
Look at that, you just grew two inches!

51:10.067 --> 51:12.486
[both laugh]

51:13.987 --> 51:14.946
[Zoe] Wow.

51:15.906 --> 51:18.950
-[chuckles]
-Could I ask you for something?

51:20.452 --> 51:21.453
Mm-hmm.

51:22.746 --> 51:25.373
Could this be from my mom,
for my birthday?

51:26.416 --> 51:27.501
"From"?

51:27.918 --> 51:32.380
Sometimes she forgets,
and my dad just gets all sad for me.

51:35.967 --> 51:36.843
Sure.

51:40.180 --> 51:42.766
[Violet] I always wanted braids
when I was younger.

51:42.933 --> 51:44.309
But my mom never let me.

51:45.727 --> 51:47.646
Maybe I could draw some on your head.

51:48.730 --> 51:51.817
-Ha. [blows raspberry]
-[both laugh]

51:54.319 --> 51:55.362
What's going on?

51:56.655 --> 51:58.365
And, again, I am... [sighs]

51:58.448 --> 52:00.867
-...sorry for just stopping by.
-No, no, no.

52:00.951 --> 52:03.286
It's... quite all right. I'm glad you did.

52:03.912 --> 52:06.289
I haven't heard Zoe laugh
like that in a long time.

52:06.373 --> 52:08.542
[chuckles] She's a funny kid.

52:08.917 --> 52:09.960
-Yeah.
-Sweet, too.

52:10.043 --> 52:10.877
Thanks.

52:13.630 --> 52:14.881
I owe you an apology.

52:15.715 --> 52:18.385
I kind of went at you the last time,
and you were just trying to help,

52:18.468 --> 52:20.053
I don't want you to think
I'm an asshole.

52:20.137 --> 52:23.557
I wasn't exactly in top form
the first time we met, either.

52:24.015 --> 52:25.684
So you do think I'm an asshole.

52:25.767 --> 52:27.227
[laughs]

52:27.894 --> 52:29.312
[man] So stay, for dinner.

52:29.604 --> 52:31.773
I'm making my famous pineapple chili.

52:32.315 --> 52:34.151
Maybe that will change your opinion.

52:35.652 --> 52:39.573
Thanks, but, um,
I have a lot of work to do.

52:39.656 --> 52:42.075
Oh, come on,
you can't work on an empty stomach.

52:42.450 --> 52:44.161
And I'm sure Zoe would love it.

52:46.371 --> 52:48.707
-[man coughs]
-[R&amp;B music playing on stereo]

52:48.790 --> 52:51.459
You know, but, honestly, real talk...

52:51.960 --> 52:54.421
Didn't the hum of the clippers...

52:55.088 --> 52:57.299
sound like Harriet Tubman calling you
to freedom?

52:57.382 --> 53:00.051
Yeah, but she lost her voice
when I woke up.

53:00.135 --> 53:02.804
[all laugh]

53:03.430 --> 53:06.933
So, what are...
What are all these plants for?

53:07.017 --> 53:08.101
They're my dad's.

53:08.310 --> 53:09.144
Really?

53:09.227 --> 53:11.605
Yeah. I use 'em
to make shampoos and stuff.

53:11.938 --> 53:12.856
Oh?

53:12.939 --> 53:16.902
You see, most women, they tell you that
they get their hair relaxed

53:16.985 --> 53:18.612
because it's more manageable.

53:19.029 --> 53:21.907
But anybody's hair is manageable
if you got the right products.

53:21.990 --> 53:25.744
Now, my products,
they take away those excuses.

53:26.286 --> 53:27.162
Excuses?

53:27.245 --> 53:28.538
Yeah. I mean, look.

53:28.622 --> 53:30.874
What, we make up 12%
of the population, right?

53:30.957 --> 53:34.711
But yet,
we buy 70% of all wigs and weaves.

53:35.003 --> 53:36.046
What does that say?

53:36.630 --> 53:38.381
Mm... We hate our hair?

53:38.465 --> 53:39.758
[man] You hate your hair.

53:39.883 --> 53:41.801
Ever since your mamas
drug you into the shop,

53:41.885 --> 53:44.638
-kicking and screaming, to get a perm.
-[Violet chuckles]

53:45.180 --> 53:47.807
You know, I swear,
I feel like a vet putting down an animal.

53:47.891 --> 53:50.477
You know, you hate to do it,
but it's part of the job.

53:50.560 --> 53:54.147
I'm just trying to change the world
one head at a time.

53:54.731 --> 53:56.733
-Starting with that one.
-[Violet and Zoe chuckle]

53:56.816 --> 53:59.611
You know,
I tell her every day she's beautiful.

53:59.694 --> 54:02.822
You know, but I'm battling TV,
commercials, magazines,

54:02.906 --> 54:06.034
telling her that long, straight hair
is what makes you beautiful.

54:06.117 --> 54:10.080
Well, I make some of those commercials,
and you can't just put the blame on us.

54:10.163 --> 54:11.873

1:06:19.058 --> 1:06:20.059

1:06:20.893 --> 1:06:23.479

I ain't gon' pass the mama test.

1:06:23.854 --> 1:06:25.564
Well, you do keep saying "ain't."

1:06:25.648 --> 1:06:27.149
Oh, it's like that now, is it?

1:06:27.775 --> 1:06:28.776
I'm good.

1:06:29.360 --> 1:06:31.529
I'm good. Hit that bell.

1:06:40.788 --> 1:06:45.084

1:06:45.167 --> 1:06:47.461
Sorry. Mom, this is Will.

1:06:47.878 --> 1:06:49.338
How do you do, Mrs. Jones?

1:06:50.423 --> 1:06:52.633
You didn't tell me
you were bringing a guest.

1:06:53.217 --> 1:06:54.593
Will brought these for you.

1:06:54.969 --> 1:06:56.095
It's from my garden.

1:06:57.096 --> 1:06:59.056
-Your garden.
-[Will] Yes, ma'am.

1:07:01.225 --> 1:07:02.351

1:07:07.023 --> 1:07:08.274
-[woman] Hi, Violet!
-Hey.

1:07:09.275 --> 1:07:10.693
Oh, Gerard!

1:07:10.776 --> 1:07:13.946
I want you to meet my-- my daughter,
Violet.

1:07:14.613 --> 1:07:16.240
Oh. Hi.

1:07:17.033 --> 1:07:21.787
I'm sorry. I was just... I was looking
at, you know, your old photos.

1:07:21.871 --> 1:07:23.372
[mother] Gerard is a lawyer.

1:07:24.081 --> 1:07:25.666
I'm actually working
in Senate these days,

1:07:25.750 --> 1:07:27.877
but law will always be my true love.

1:07:27.960 --> 1:07:29.712
Hey, how you doin', man? Will Wright.

1:07:29.795 --> 1:07:32.298
How you doing? Oh!
That's quite a handshake you got there.

1:07:32.381 --> 1:07:33.632
You must work with your hands.

1:07:33.716 --> 1:07:38.429
Violet, would-- would you go
and fix Gerard a drink, please?

1:07:38.512 --> 1:07:39.764
What, his hand's broke?

1:07:39.847 --> 1:07:42.058
[all chuckle]

1:07:42.141 --> 1:07:43.809
-That's very funny.
-Mm-hmm.

1:07:44.351 --> 1:07:45.644
Are you a comedian?

1:07:47.605 --> 1:07:49.440
Well, what is it that you do do?

1:07:49.815 --> 1:07:51.859
-I own--
-Will owns his own business.

1:07:52.443 --> 1:07:53.402
My own business.

1:07:53.486 --> 1:07:55.237
[mother] Oh, really?

1:07:55.946 --> 1:07:57.364
And how did the two of you meet?

1:07:57.448 --> 1:07:59.200
-We met--
-We met professionally.

1:08:00.034 --> 1:08:03.370
Well, owning your own business,
that does beat working for the Man.

1:08:04.038 --> 1:08:05.122
Ain't that the truth?

1:08:05.623 --> 1:08:06.665
Isn't it, though?

1:08:06.749 --> 1:08:09.627
And isn't it wonderful to be successful?

1:08:10.628 --> 1:08:11.629
Yeah, that's right.

1:08:11.712 --> 1:08:14.173
So, anytime any of you need a cut,
come on into my shop.

1:08:14.256 --> 1:08:16.175
I just might take you up on that.

1:08:16.258 --> 1:08:18.677
Think I could do one of those frohawks?

1:08:19.345 --> 1:08:22.348
-Mm-mm.
-You own a hair shop?

1:08:22.431 --> 1:08:23.724
Mom, it's a great salon.

1:08:23.808 --> 1:08:25.434
No, no, no. Shop is fine.

1:08:25.810 --> 1:08:28.729
And, yes, I do, Miss Jones,
just like my mama before me.

1:08:29.939 --> 1:08:32.274
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I gotta go pick up my daughter.

1:08:33.734 --> 1:08:35.653
So this is the date with no car.

1:08:36.612 --> 1:08:37.822
[scoffs] Wow.

1:08:38.739 --> 1:08:39.573
Will.

1:08:42.118 --> 1:08:44.078
I was serious about the frohawk.

1:08:44.537 --> 1:08:45.371
[Violet] Will!

1:08:47.623 --> 1:08:49.625
Will, please wait a minute!

1:08:51.418 --> 1:08:52.419
I embarrass you now?

1:08:52.503 --> 1:08:53.796
-No!
-So what was that?

1:08:55.840 --> 1:08:59.009
You know, you're a cool sister,
you really are, but...

1:09:00.094 --> 1:09:02.304
I don't know. I thought we had something.

1:09:02.388 --> 1:09:03.222
So do I!

1:09:03.305 --> 1:09:05.933
But you seem to be mixed up
about who I am and who you are,

1:09:06.016 --> 1:09:07.893
and a bunch of other important things.

1:09:07.977 --> 1:09:11.689
And seeing as how I have a daughter,
I'm trying real hard not to fuck up.

1:09:12.148 --> 1:09:14.900
I'm not in a position to be taking chances
while you figure it all out.

1:09:18.696 --> 1:09:20.030
Just get yourself sorted.

1:09:21.991 --> 1:09:23.200
Have a happy Fourth.

1:09:37.756 --> 1:09:39.758
[Violet] Think, Violet, think.

1:09:44.054 --> 1:09:46.640
Something different. [sighs]

1:09:51.979 --> 1:09:54.648
Hey, Violet,
they're moving to the conference room.

1:09:54.732 --> 1:09:55.608
Okay.

1:09:56.025 --> 1:09:57.401
It's really great.

1:09:57.943 --> 1:09:58.819
Thanks.

1:10:08.245 --> 1:10:09.330
[Violet] "Girls' Night Out."

1:10:10.247 --> 1:10:11.665
We're at Philips Arena.

1:10:12.166 --> 1:10:17.171
Hawks are playing the Cavs,
and we push into four crazy loud,

1:10:17.254 --> 1:10:19.465
annoying guys in Cavs jerseys.

1:10:19.548 --> 1:10:22.593
They're surrounded by rows of women
in Hawks gear.

1:10:22.927 --> 1:10:26.764
Cavs are winning,
and our four guys are standing up,

1:10:26.847 --> 1:10:31.310
cheering and annoying the hell out of
a female fan sitting in front of 'em.

1:10:31.644 --> 1:10:36.690
Then, an Amber Lite vendor approaches,
and the annoyed girl calls him over,

1:10:36.774 --> 1:10:39.860
orders four Amber Lites,
and hands 'em to the guys behind her.

1:10:40.694 --> 1:10:41.695
They're shocked.

1:10:42.154 --> 1:10:47.368
They sit down, clink their bottles,
and enjoy the rest of the game silently.

1:10:47.952 --> 1:10:51.163
The girl in front smiles,
turns to her friend,

1:10:51.247 --> 1:10:53.916
gives her a pound,
and turns back to the game.

1:10:53.999 --> 1:10:57.044
A cut to a little later,
our boys are depressed.

1:10:57.127 --> 1:10:58.462
Their bottles are empty.

1:10:58.837 --> 1:11:01.966
They look at each other
and smile mischievously.

1:11:02.800 --> 1:11:06.720
They stand up all at once
and start screaming.

1:11:06.971 --> 1:11:12.017
This time, every girl around them
starts waving over the Amber Lite vendor.

1:11:13.227 --> 1:11:16.438
"Amber Lite: It Does You Right."

1:11:18.941 --> 1:11:20.526
-Good pitch.
-[chuckles]

1:11:20.609 --> 1:11:22.987
And, um, these friends,
how do you see them?

1:11:23.487 --> 1:11:26.407
Uh... Real women, no models.

1:11:26.490 --> 1:11:28.951
I want each and every one of them
to have their own unique vibe.

1:11:29.034 --> 1:11:29.868
Okay.

1:11:30.577 --> 1:11:32.288
It's not the typical way
to sell the product,

1:11:32.371 --> 1:11:34.081
but it is funny, and effective,

1:11:34.164 --> 1:11:36.166
and I think it could appeal
to the male audience.

1:11:36.375 --> 1:11:38.377
-Thank you, Violet, thank you.
-Good job.

1:11:38.460 --> 1:11:40.796
All right, Rich, you're up.
What do you got?

1:11:44.133 --> 1:11:47.886
We're on a cruise ship,
and it's going down.

1:11:47.970 --> 1:11:49.471
All the life rafts are full,

1:11:49.555 --> 1:11:51.682
but there's still two guys left
on the boat.

1:11:51.765 --> 1:11:52.808
One is a stud.

1:11:52.891 --> 1:11:54.643
The other is some corny-looking dude.

1:11:54.727 --> 1:11:57.855
But then these two gorgeous women,
long blonde hair,

1:11:57.938 --> 1:12:00.816
big breasts, they float up in a life raft,

1:12:00.899 --> 1:12:03.527
and they call out
that they can hold one more.

1:12:04.028 --> 1:12:07.323
And of course, the stud grins,
and he pulls his shirt off,

1:12:07.406 --> 1:12:10.200
and he's got the pecs and the six-pack.

1:12:10.284 --> 1:12:13.120
But, to his shock,
they point to the cornball.

1:12:13.662 --> 1:12:18.208
And then we see why: The cornball
is holding a six-pack of Amber Lite.

1:12:18.375 --> 1:12:19.877
[imitates explosion]

1:12:19.960 --> 1:12:22.629
We cut to later, and he's laying
in the raft with the girls,

1:12:22.963 --> 1:12:28.010
all three drinking an Amber Lite,
watching the stud go down with the ship.

1:12:28.093 --> 1:12:29.178
[chuckles softly]

1:12:31.221 --> 1:12:32.598

Well.

1:12:35.392 --> 1:12:36.769
Okay. [groans]

1:12:37.311 --> 1:12:38.395
Um...

1:12:39.897 --> 1:12:41.565
I'm gonna go with Rich.

1:12:42.858 --> 1:12:45.527
-[Alicia] What?
-But what's fresh about that?

1:12:45.611 --> 1:12:47.529
We've heard that pitch a thousand times.

1:12:47.613 --> 1:12:49.531
If it ain't broke, right?

1:12:50.657 --> 1:12:53.535

on your perspective.

Actually, I've been thinking about it
for a while now.

1:13:10.344 --> 1:13:12.763

to step outside the box.

1:30:48.276 --> 1:30:50.987
In the past couple years,
there's been a huge cultural shift

1:30:51.070 --> 1:30:52.697
towards what's natural and real.

1:30:52.780 --> 1:30:55.241
We've seen it in the growth
of natural foods,

1:30:55.741 --> 1:30:59.954
the demand for eco-friendly cars,
to just about any product you can imagine.

1:31:00.830 --> 1:31:05.793
Will wants women to change the way
we are thinking about our hair.

1:31:06.169 --> 1:31:09.547
He wants us to know that there
is beauty in our natural hair,

1:31:09.630 --> 1:31:11.966
regardless of what type of hair we have.

1:31:12.049 --> 1:31:16.721
And his product line, YOU,
helps us bring out that natural beauty.

1:31:18.389 --> 1:31:20.266
But why would I push a product

1:31:20.349 --> 1:31:23.352
that totally undercuts
what I'm already selling?

1:31:23.436 --> 1:31:26.564
Listen, women can wear weaves
if they want to.

1:31:27.440 --> 1:31:29.775
They can straighten their hair
if they want to.

1:31:29.859 --> 1:31:30.943
It's a choice.

1:31:31.027 --> 1:31:32.737
There's nothing wrong with that.

1:31:33.404 --> 1:31:37.200
But we also need them to know that
there is beauty in their natural hair.

1:31:37.742 --> 1:31:41.370
Large grocery store chains
didn't ignore the health food craze,

1:31:41.454 --> 1:31:44.081
they integrated it
and kept their customers.

1:31:44.165 --> 1:31:46.876
The shift has already begun
with hair and beauty,

1:31:47.168 --> 1:31:50.588
and women of color are one
of the biggest markets there is for hair.

1:31:51.380 --> 1:31:55.593
Let us be the first to offer them
something that protects,

1:31:55.676 --> 1:31:57.303
rather than destroys, their hair.

1:32:00.890 --> 1:32:02.099
You were great in there.

1:32:02.517 --> 1:32:06.395
-Thank you. Your passion is an easy sell.
-Not gonna lie, though.

1:32:06.479 --> 1:32:10.775
I didn't know what to expect, you know,
with all your personal shit.

1:32:11.776 --> 1:32:13.819
Wow. [chuckles]

1:32:13.903 --> 1:32:15.196
I guess that's fair.

1:32:16.614 --> 1:32:18.991
But I keep my personal out of my business.

1:32:19.367 --> 1:32:21.702
I try to,
but it doesn't always work like that.

1:32:23.287 --> 1:32:28.584
I'm still salty at you,
so I kind of feel like I'm using you.

1:32:30.378 --> 1:32:31.629
I'm using you, too.

1:32:33.839 --> 1:32:35.800
But you can't be salty at me forever.

1:32:38.219 --> 1:32:39.262
Change the world?

1:32:40.763 --> 1:32:41.931
One head at a time.
