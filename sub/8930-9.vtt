â™ª

00:19.969 --> 00:21.136
- [roaring]

00:32.404 --> 00:34.938
- BEAST WARS!

00:38.405 --> 00:40.939
BEAST WARS!

00:50.074 --> 00:51.974
- [hissing]

00:58.175 --> 01:01.143
- BEAST WARS!

01:28.347 --> 01:30.948
- ENERGY GRIDS HOLDING.

01:31.048 --> 01:32.948
IT'S NO QUANTUM SURGE, BUT IT SHOULD DO THE TRICK.

01:36.849 --> 01:38.482
ON-LINE!

01:44.117 --> 01:47.784
- ENERGY SURGE DETECTED AT VECTOR 0-1-0.

01:52.184 --> 01:56.119
- HIT ME... WITH YOUR BEST SHOT!

01:57.285 --> 01:59.519
[screaming]

01:59.619 --> 02:01.919
- BLACKARACHNIA!

02:02.019 --> 02:04.687
- SILVERBOLT! NO! YOU--

02:04.786 --> 02:07.320
- [yells]

02:10.654 --> 02:12.388
- WAY TO GO, BOWSER.

02:12.488 --> 02:15.488
YOU JUST BLEW A DECA-CYCLE OF HARD WORK.

02:15.588 --> 02:20.189
AND I'M STILL THE SAME OLD ME.

02:20.288 --> 02:23.323
- WHAT IN THE NAME OF THE MATRIX ARE YOU DOING?

02:23.423 --> 02:25.057
- GOING TRANSMETAL.

02:25.156 --> 02:27.391
AND IF YOU HADN'T DISRUPTED THE ENERGY FLOW

02:27.490 --> 02:30.257
FROM THAT ALIEN GIZMO, IT MIGHT HAVE WORKED!

02:30.357 --> 02:34.091
- ARE YOU MAD? YOU COULD HAVE DAMAGED YOURSELF!

02:34.191 --> 02:35.325
OR WORSE!

02:35.425 --> 02:37.859
- I FIGURED IF MEGATRON COULD USE IT

02:37.959 --> 02:40.493
TO CREATE A TRANSMETAL, SO COULD I.

02:40.593 --> 02:44.060
IT'S NOT LIKE I HAVEN'T-- AAARGH!

02:44.160 --> 02:48.193
- BLACKARACHNIA! WHAT'S WRONG?

03:00.729 --> 03:02.130
WHAT IS IT, RHINOX?

03:02.230 --> 03:06.363
- THE PRED SHELL PROGRAM THEY IMPLANTED IS DETERIORATING.

03:06.463 --> 03:10.264
IF IT CONTINUES, IT WILL INFECT HER MAXIMAL CORE CONSCIOUSNESS.

03:10.364 --> 03:12.297
- OH.

03:12.398 --> 03:14.098
SOUNDS...SERIOUS.

03:14.198 --> 03:17.532
- BLACKARACHNIA.

03:17.632 --> 03:19.665
- GUESS USING THE TRANSMETAL DRIVER ON MYSELF

03:19.766 --> 03:21.333
WASN'T SUCH A GOOD IDEA.

03:21.432 --> 03:23.866
- I THOUGHT YOU WERE SMARTER THAN THAT.

03:23.966 --> 03:26.034
AND HOW DID YOU GET THE DRIVER?

03:26.134 --> 03:28.733
- I...KIND OF... BORROWED IT.

03:28.833 --> 03:30.067
- WHY?

03:30.167 --> 03:33.301
- DUH, TRANSMETALS HAVE MORE POWER.

03:33.402 --> 03:35.368
I WANTED IT.

03:35.468 --> 03:37.668
- THEN YOU SHOULD HAVE TOLD US. WE COULD HAVE HELPED.

03:37.769 --> 03:39.002
- OH, YEAH, SURE.

03:39.102 --> 03:41.636
LIKE YOU WERE GONNA HELP THE PRED GET MORE POWERFUL.

03:41.736 --> 03:43.803
- MAXIMAL OR PREDACON, YOU'RE ONE OF US.

03:43.903 --> 03:46.504
YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT BY NOW. - ENOUGH!

03:46.604 --> 03:50.604
OUR ONLY CONCERN NOW IS BLACKARACHNIA'S WELL-BEING.

03:53.204 --> 03:55.004
- YOU'RE RIGHT. RHINOX?

03:55.104 --> 03:58.172
- I CAN'T STOP THE DETERIORATION.

03:58.272 --> 04:00.339
BUT I COULD TRY SEVERING THE PRED-SHELL PROGRAM

04:00.439 --> 04:02.806
FROM HER CORE CONSCIOUSNESS.

04:02.906 --> 04:04.973
THE ONLY PROBLEM IS...

04:05.073 --> 04:07.206
IT'S NEVER BEEN DONE BEFORE.

04:10.541 --> 04:12.941
- AND IF WE DON'T TRY?

04:13.041 --> 04:15.441
- SHE'LL GO INSANE, AND EVENTUALLY,

04:15.541 --> 04:17.975
HER ENTIRE CORE WILL BE WIPED.

04:18.075 --> 04:19.675
SHE'LL BE A BLANK.

04:19.776 --> 04:21.909
- UGH. GREAT CHOICE.

04:22.009 --> 04:25.309
BE A MAXIMAL, OR DROOL OIL FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE.

04:25.410 --> 04:28.977
- WE WANT TO SAVE YOUR LIFE.

04:29.077 --> 04:31.511
- IT'LL TAKE A LITTLE TIME TO GET THE PROBE READY.

04:31.611 --> 04:34.111
- WE'LL LET YOU KNOW WHEN WE'RE READY.

04:48.980 --> 04:52.881
- ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

04:52.981 --> 04:55.882
- I ALWAYS FIGURED IF ANYONE SURVIVED THE BEAST WARS,

04:55.982 --> 04:58.115
IT'D BE ME.

04:58.215 --> 04:59.815
LOOKS LIKE I WAS WRONG.

04:59.915 --> 05:03.549
- YOU MUSTN'T SAY SUCH THINGS. RHINOX WILL FIND A WAY.

05:03.649 --> 05:04.783
TRUST IN HIM.

05:04.883 --> 05:09.284
- TRUST ISN'T EASY FOR A PREDACON.

05:09.383 --> 05:13.885
- YOU'RE ONLY A PREDACON BECAUSE OF TARANTULAS.

05:13.985 --> 05:15.785
INSIDE YOU'RE A MAXIMAL.

05:15.885 --> 05:18.285
WHEN THIS IS OVER, YOU'LL BE ONE AGAIN.

05:18.385 --> 05:20.452
AS YOU WERE MEANT TO BE.

05:20.552 --> 05:24.219
- EASY FOR YOU TO SAY. YOU ENJOY THIS HERO STUFF.

05:24.319 --> 05:26.553
ME? I'M A BAD GIRL AT HEART.

05:26.653 --> 05:29.487
- OH, I KNOW YOUR HEART.

05:29.587 --> 05:32.654
AND WHEN I LOOK INTO IT I SEE NO EVIL.

05:32.754 --> 05:35.155
ONLY LOVE.

05:35.255 --> 05:37.221
- SAPPY AS ALWAYS.

05:37.321 --> 05:40.089
WHAT DID I EVER SEE IN YOU ANYWAY?

05:40.189 --> 05:43.923
OH, YEAH. I REMEMBER.

05:44.023 --> 05:46.424
[crackling]

05:46.523 --> 05:48.657
- NO!

05:56.892 --> 05:58.892
- HOW DO YOU FEEL?

05:58.992 --> 06:01.292
- UGH. LIKE SOMEONE'S BEEN PLAYING SQUASH THE SPIDER

06:01.392 --> 06:03.325
WITH AN ENERGON BALL.

06:03.426 --> 06:04.893
- THEN WE BETTER START.

06:04.993 --> 06:07.026
- ARE YOU READY?

06:07.126 --> 06:12.361
- ALL EXCEPT FOR ONE THING. DECRYPT DATATRAX WIDOW'S EDGE.

06:12.461 --> 06:15.228
PREPARE FOR DIRECT DOWNLOAD.

06:15.327 --> 06:16.895
THE ARC'S ACCESS CODES.

06:16.995 --> 06:18.796
I FIGURE YOU HAVE THE BEST CHANCE

06:18.895 --> 06:21.395
OF KEEPING THEM AWAY FROM MEGA-EGO.

06:29.264 --> 06:32.330
- YOU COULDN'T PAY ME TO LET THAT SPIDER

06:32.431 --> 06:34.198
INSIDE MY PROCESSOR.

06:34.298 --> 06:35.365
- SHUT UP, RATTRAP!

06:35.465 --> 06:39.166
- LISTEN TO HIM, RAT, IF YOU VALUE YOUR SPARK.

06:39.266 --> 06:42.899
- WAS THAT A THREAT? - COUNT ON IT!

06:47.300 --> 06:49.267
- THANKS FOR ALL YOUR HELP.

06:49.367 --> 06:50.834
- SPARE ME THE MAXIMAL MUSH,

06:50.934 --> 06:52.467
AND LET'S GET THE BALL BEARING ROLLING.

07:09.437 --> 07:11.571
SEE YA SOON, BOYS...

07:11.670 --> 07:14.571
IF YOU'RE LUCKY.

07:19.939 --> 07:21.739
- ENGAGE REMOTE NETWORK.

07:27.339 --> 07:31.908
LOCK DOWN.

07:32.008 --> 07:34.507
POWER UP TRANSMISSION WARP.

07:43.443 --> 07:47.177
- RETURN TO ME SOON, BELOVED.

07:47.277 --> 07:50.110
- SHUT DOWN ON MY MARK.

07:53.777 --> 07:57.411
MARK.

08:33.051 --> 08:35.118
STASIS LOCK DISABLED.

08:38.018 --> 08:41.019

08:50.587 --> 08:53.288
[alarm]

08:56.922 --> 08:59.522

08:59.621 --> 09:00.922

09:01.022 --> 09:04.355

09:04.456 --> 09:06.989
- BLACKARACHNIA?

09:07.089 --> 09:09.356
TARANTULAS TO MEGATRON.

09:09.457 --> 09:12.024
- AH, LIEUTENANT. WHAT NEWS?

09:12.124 --> 09:14.691
- I'VE JUST LEARNED THE MAXIMALS ARE TAMPERING

09:14.791 --> 09:17.058
WITH BLACKARACHNIA'S SHELL PROGRAM.

09:17.158 --> 09:18.858
- IMPOSSIBLE!

09:18.958 --> 09:20.992
THEY WOULDN'T CHANCE THAT UNLESS--

09:21.092 --> 09:25.560
UNLESS SHE'S PASSED THE ACCESS CODES ON TO SOMEONE ELSE.

09:25.660 --> 09:27.927
- OPTIMUS, NO DOUBT.

09:28.027 --> 09:29.526
- OF COURSE.

09:29.626 --> 09:32.260
WHICH FITS IN NICELY WITH OUR LITTLE PLAN FOR HIM.

09:32.360 --> 09:33.828
BUT WHAT OF BLACKARACHNIA?

09:33.928 --> 09:36.628
- SHE'LL NEVER SURVIVE THE ATTEMPT.

09:36.727 --> 09:39.995
THE SHELL I IMPLANTED IN HER HAS CERTAIN...

09:40.095 --> 09:42.563
SAFEGUARDS. HEH HEH.

09:42.663 --> 09:44.429
- EXCELLENT.

09:44.529 --> 09:46.496
BUT JUST TO BE ON THE SAFE SIDE,

09:46.596 --> 09:48.263
I BELIEVE WE'LL GIVE THE MAXIMALS

09:48.363 --> 09:51.197
SOMETHING ELSE TO WORRY ABOUT.

09:51.297 --> 09:53.264
YES. [toy squeaks]

10:14.501 --> 10:15.568
- SLAG!

10:15.668 --> 10:17.402
THIS IS TARANTULAS'S WORK.

10:17.501 --> 10:18.635
WE HAVE TO INTERCEPT IT

10:18.734 --> 10:21.302
BEFORE IT REACHES HER CORE CONSCIOUSNESS!

10:32.838 --> 10:36.105
NOT TOO SHABBY.

10:41.505 --> 10:43.272

10:43.372 --> 10:44.973
- QUIT YAPPING AND MAN THE LAB CONSOLE.

10:45.072 --> 10:47.773
I NEED BACK-UP!

10:50.173 --> 10:52.474
- RATTRAP, REPORT!

10:52.574 --> 10:53.841
- WHOO-HOO!

10:53.941 --> 10:56.641
OH, WE GOT PREDS POPPIN' UP FROM UNDER EVERY ROCK!

10:56.741 --> 10:58.708
I'M BRINGING THE AUTOGUNS ON-LINE.

10:58.808 --> 11:01.175
- [cackling]

11:04.342 --> 11:08.243
- INCREASE EMERGENCY POWER FLOW TO 9.6.

11:08.343 --> 11:11.844
- YES. YES, IT'S DONE.

11:18.878 --> 11:20.178
- RATTRAP?

11:20.278 --> 11:23.012
- I CAN'T GET A GOOD FEED ON THEM WITH THE AUTOGUNS.

11:23.112 --> 11:24.446
THEY'RE SHOOTING FROM COVER,

11:24.546 --> 11:27.179
AND AS FAR AS I CAN TELL THEY'RE AIMING AT THE WALLS.

11:27.279 --> 11:29.513
- THEY'RE TRYING TO DISRUPT OUR POWER.

11:29.613 --> 11:31.414
SOMEHOW THEY KNOW WHAT WE'RE DOING.

11:31.514 --> 11:32.948
WE'VE GOT TO ENGAGE THEM.

11:33.047 --> 11:35.781
OPTIMUS PRIMAL, MAXIMIZE!

11:37.448 --> 11:38.982

11:44.649 --> 11:45.649
- SPREAD OUT!

11:45.749 --> 11:48.050
DRAW THEIR FIRE AWAY FROM THE BASE.

11:49.650 --> 11:53.550
- IGNORE THE MAXIMALS. CONTINUE TO TARGET THE BASE.

11:53.650 --> 11:56.818
- SYSTEMS ARE STABLE. KEEP THE POWER LEVEL UP.

11:56.918 --> 11:59.152
- YOU CAN RELY ON ME.

12:04.853 --> 12:09.220

12:33.891 --> 12:35.924

13:17.998 --> 13:19.165
UH-OH.

13:19.265 --> 13:21.465
WE GOT TROUBLE.

13:31.534 --> 13:35.701
- GOODBYE, MY TREACHEROUS CREATION.

13:39.068 --> 13:43.703

14:11.373 --> 14:12.907
I'M...

14:13.007 --> 14:14.274
SORRY.

14:26.676 --> 14:29.743
- BLACKARACHNIA?

14:35.777 --> 14:39.712
- I'LL LET OPTIMUS KNOW.

14:42.912 --> 14:45.813
- TARANTULAS!

14:53.114 --> 14:54.248

14:54.348 --> 14:58.314

15:11.750 --> 15:14.351
HEY, DID WE WHIP THEIR TAILS OR WHAT?

15:14.451 --> 15:16.150

15:16.251 --> 15:17.618
[cheering]

15:17.718 --> 15:22.252
- NO. SOMETHING IS WRONG.

15:24.253 --> 15:25.620
RHINOX?

15:31.587 --> 15:34.687
- I NEVER THOUGHT I'D SAY IT, BUT, UH...

15:34.787 --> 15:37.188
I'M GONNA MISS HER.

15:37.288 --> 15:40.788
- I KNOW I WILL. SHE WAS SOMETHING SPECIAL.

15:40.889 --> 15:43.289
- WE SHOULD HAVE TRUSTED HER MORE.

15:43.389 --> 15:45.723
IF ONLY BECAUSE SILVERBOLT LOVED HER.

15:48.257 --> 15:50.590
- YEAH.

15:50.690 --> 15:52.824
WHERE IS THE BIRD-DOG ANYWAY?

15:54.291 --> 15:56.291
- HE COULDN'T HAVE--

15:56.391 --> 15:59.725
OH, NO.

16:14.461 --> 16:15.994
- TARANTULAS...

16:16.094 --> 16:18.628
SHE'S...GONE.

16:18.728 --> 16:21.195
AND IT'S ALL BECAUSE OF YOU!

16:21.295 --> 16:24.495
SILVERBOLT, MAXIMIZE!

16:37.098 --> 16:41.932
YOU'VE TWISTED YOUR LAST INNOCENT LIFE, SPIDER!

18:13.680 --> 18:16.748

18:17.948 --> 18:20.649

18:20.748 --> 18:23.382
[chuckling].

18:35.384 --> 18:40.652

19:41.061 --> 19:43.929
HMMPH. NOT TOO SHABBY.

19:44.029 --> 19:47.663
- BLACKARACHNIA?

19:47.763 --> 19:51.363
- YOU'RE NOT GONNA QUIT ON ME NOW, BOWSER.

19:51.463 --> 19:54.997
NOT WHEN I'VE HAD MY NAILS DONE AND EVERYTHING.

20:03.566 --> 20:05.299
I WISH I COULD EXPLAIN IT.

20:05.399 --> 20:08.400
ONE MINUTE, I WAS TUMBLING DOWN A DARK PIT.

20:08.500 --> 20:11.166
THE NEXT, THERE WAS THIS... LIGHT!

20:11.266 --> 20:13.567
THEN I SAW SILVERBOLT IN DANGER.

20:13.667 --> 20:16.768
- AND RUSHED OFF ON YOUR OWN AS USUAL.

20:16.868 --> 20:19.201
NOT A VERY MAXIMAL APPROACH.

20:19.302 --> 20:23.902
- EVEN IF I'M GOOD, I'M STILL BAD.

20:24.002 --> 20:26.969
- AND STILL AS WELCOME AS MOONLIGHT.

20:30.937 --> 20:34.637
WHEN I THOUGHT YOU WERE GONE, I...

20:34.737 --> 20:38.505
- YOU DON'T GET RID OF A PRIZE LIKE ME THAT EASY, JOJO.

20:38.604 --> 20:43.405
BUT IF I KEEP HAVING TO SAVE YOU WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO SAVE ME,

20:43.505 --> 20:45.272
MY FUTURE MAY BE IN DOUBT.

20:45.372 --> 20:47.406
SO...KNOCK IT OFF!

20:47.506 --> 20:52.874
- I'M SORRY, BUT I WILL EVER BE YOUR CHAMPION, MILADY.

20:52.973 --> 20:56.574
- AH. THE WAY YOU TALK.

21:01.741 --> 21:05.175
TRANSMETAL POWER-- BETTER GET USED TO IT.
