WEBVTT

00:02.470 --> 00:04.461
(playing a tune)

00:17.410 --> 00:19.469
(similar tune playing)

00:19.520 --> 00:21.442
WOMAN: Now, with text
deposit, you can manage

00:21.480 --> 00:24.040
your accounts from
literally anywhere.

00:24.090 --> 00:26.308
You can bank on it.
You can

00:26.360 --> 00:29.523
bank on us--
Sequoia Liberty.

00:29.560 --> 00:31.050
(music ends)

00:31.090 --> 00:33.058
Okay, yes, they do
sound similar.

00:33.100 --> 00:34.692
They're
the same song.

00:34.730 --> 00:36.561
Someone stole my song

00:36.600 --> 00:38.761
and turned it into a jingle.

00:38.800 --> 00:41.337
(crash in distance)

00:41.370 --> 00:44.134
You said you never
played this at a show?

00:44.170 --> 00:46.331
I have a little studio space
in Alphabet City.

00:46.380 --> 00:47.836
I do everything there.

00:47.880 --> 00:50.440
But it's soundproofed.
When I'm writing,

00:50.480 --> 00:53.244
I work alone.
(loud clattering)

00:54.480 --> 00:57.745
Could you just
excuse me for a moment?

01:01.290 --> 01:03.326
Watson.

01:03.360 --> 01:06.329
What are you doing?
(sighs) Having worked
through the night

01:06.360 --> 01:08.521
at various pursuits, I am now
attempting to fall asleep.

01:08.560 --> 01:10.494
Obviously.

01:10.530 --> 01:13.363
You familiar with the surrealist
works of Salvador Dal?

01:13.400 --> 01:15.163
Yes, of course
I am familiar with Dal.

01:15.200 --> 01:17.407
Well, we share the same
opinion of sleep.

01:17.440 --> 01:19.806
Namely that it is
a waste of time.

01:19.840 --> 01:21.637
There may exist,
however, a moment

01:21.680 --> 01:23.307
at the boundary between
working and sleeping

01:23.350 --> 01:25.500
which holds some
utility. He would use

01:25.550 --> 01:26.847
a similar method
to catch himself

01:26.880 --> 01:28.609
the instant he fell asleep

01:28.650 --> 01:31.289
and record glimpses
into his subconscious mind.

01:31.320 --> 01:33.311
And I'm trying to train
my own subconscious

01:33.360 --> 01:35.851
_ to solve more
Impenetrable problems.

01:35.890 --> 01:38.188
Though I do realize
that from the outside it seems

01:38.230 --> 01:40.824
no more pragmatic that a visit
to the Delphic Oracle.

01:40.860 --> 01:42.566
From the outside,
it makes a lot of noise.

01:42.600 --> 01:44.295
I'm meeting with
a client downstairs.

01:44.330 --> 01:46.161
A woman, no? If she's
the one playing

01:46.200 --> 01:47.895
the guitar, you might
want to suggest that a tuning

01:47.940 --> 01:50.329
is in order. _
Does her case Intrigue?

01:50.370 --> 01:52.429
Do you require
my assistance?

01:52.480 --> 01:54.801
I require a little quiet.
That's all.

01:54.840 --> 01:58.571
I shall continue my experiment
on a higher floor.

02:05.420 --> 02:07.411
(phone rings)

02:09.860 --> 02:11.828
Captain.

02:11.860 --> 02:15.250
Hey, I've got two detectives
from the 3-5 here.

02:15.300 --> 02:17.723
They want to talk to you about
a homicide they're working.

02:17.770 --> 02:20.466
Yes, of course.
Watson is otherwise engaged,

02:20.500 --> 02:22.400
but I can be there
in about 30 minutes.

02:22.440 --> 02:25.204
I'll see you then.

02:26.940 --> 02:29.443
Holmes, this is Detective Demps

02:29.480 --> 02:31.402
and McShane.
Gentlemen.

02:31.450 --> 02:34.419
Heard a lot about you
the last couple years.

02:34.450 --> 02:36.315
Despite my best efforts,

02:36.350 --> 02:38.386
I assure you.

02:38.420 --> 02:40.513
How can I help you?

02:40.560 --> 02:42.221
Maria Gutierrez.

02:42.260 --> 02:44.387
She went missing
a little over three years ago.

02:44.430 --> 02:45.749
Last week_her remains
were discovered

02:45.790 --> 02:47.428
by a city worker in a vacant lot

02:47.460 --> 02:50.224
next to Thomas Jefferson Park.
Erosion had partially

02:50.270 --> 02:51.760
uncovered the grave.
M.E.

02:51.800 --> 02:54.860
said she died from
blunt force trauma to the head.

02:54.900 --> 02:57.460
Mm-hmm.

02:57.510 --> 03:00.502
Yeah.

03:00.540 --> 03:03.771
_ Ms. Gutie_rrez worked
In a custodial professron,

03:03.810 --> 03:06.847
night shifts,
mostly.

03:06.880 --> 03:09.417
You, uh, you saying
you knew her?

03:09.450 --> 03:11.281
Certainly not.

03:11.320 --> 03:13.515
The hair on her right forearm
is a distinctly lighter shade

03:13.560 --> 03:15.949
than that on her left. Um,
ammonia and bleach, of course,

03:15.990 --> 03:18.527
whiten body hair. Her natural
hair color resumes at a line

03:18.560 --> 03:20.391
where one imagines
she wore rubber gloves.

03:20.430 --> 03:22.967
Her skin tone is_ also
several shades lighter

03:23.000 --> 03:24.524
than that of her
immediate relatives,

03:24.570 --> 03:26.367
indicating a more
nocturnal lifestyle.

03:26.400 --> 03:29.608
No, no way.
You had to know her.

03:29.640 --> 03:32.302
You indicated

03:32.340 --> 03:34.535
that you were familiar
with my methods.
Yeah, well, we heard

03:34.580 --> 03:36.343
you knew a few tricks.

03:36.380 --> 03:38.439
Not tricks.

03:38.480 --> 03:40.619
You sure you don't know her?

03:40.650 --> 03:42.641
Never laid eyes
on her before?

03:50.030 --> 03:52.225
This is not a consultation,
it's an interrogation.

03:56.670 --> 03:59.491
So, would you like to tell me
why you consider me a suspect?

03:59.540 --> 04:00.734
(sighs)
Mm-hmm?

04:00.770 --> 04:03.432
_ We found this
in the Victim's purse.

04:03.470 --> 04:05.267
McSHANE:
It's a receipt
from a coffee shop

04:05.310 --> 04:07.403
two blocks
from your re5idence,

04:07.440 --> 04:08.976
dated the day
that Maria disappeared.

04:09.010 --> 04:11.570
Want to tell us again
how you don't know her?

04:21.520 --> 04:22.851
DEMPS:
I know what you're thinking.

04:22.890 --> 04:25.450
S. Holmes--
that could be a lot of people.

04:25.490 --> 04:27.799
Maybe there's a Steve Holmes
out there, or a Sally.

04:27.830 --> 04:30.424
But we showed it to our
handwriting expert at Q-DOC.

04:30.470 --> 04:32.961
I could have
saved you the trouble.

04:33.000 --> 04:35.867
I'm the author of that note.
There is no doubt.

04:35.900 --> 04:39.006
Oh, then you lied when you said
you didn't know Maria Gutierrez.

04:39.040 --> 04:41.508
I did not lie.

04:41.540 --> 04:43.576
I do not recall her face

04:43.610 --> 04:45.009
and I have no memory of writing

04:45.050 --> 04:48.440
to her.
DEMPS:
You saying you have amnesia?

04:48.480 --> 04:50.345
Of a sort.

04:50.390 --> 04:52.984
During the period
in question-- late 2011,

04:53.020 --> 04:54.510
when Ms. Gutierrez disappeared--

04:54.560 --> 04:57.654
I was quite addicted
to narcotics.

04:57.690 --> 04:59.453
A great variety
of them,

04:59.500 --> 05:00.728
in fact.

05:00.760 --> 05:03.661
Blackouts were not uncommon.

05:03.700 --> 05:05.429
McSHANE:
And on this night in particular,

05:05.470 --> 05:08.496
the 7th of December, 2011?

05:08.540 --> 05:11.429
I do not believe
I could be much clearer.

05:11.470 --> 05:13.836
I have no recollection
of this woman

05:13.880 --> 05:15.905
or anything that might
have happened to her.

05:15.940 --> 05:17.498
Guys,

05:17.550 --> 05:19.472
it's a note.
Received

05:19.520 --> 05:21.818
by our vic the day she
disappeared, one your consultant

05:21.850 --> 05:23.579
just admitted he wrote.

05:23.620 --> 05:25.588
She was a cleaner,
maybe he wanted to hire her.

05:25.620 --> 05:27.588
Before we came here, you said
this was a waste of time,

05:27.620 --> 05:28.848
you knew your guy.

05:28.890 --> 05:30.084
I do.

05:30.130 --> 05:31.882
Did you know about
the blackouts?

05:34.030 --> 05:37.659
You asked for five minutes,
I gave you five minutes.

05:37.700 --> 05:39.839
If anything
else occurs

05:39.870 --> 05:43.408
to my consultant,
I'm sure he'll be in touch.

05:57.090 --> 05:59.081
(door closes)

06:13.740 --> 06:16.061
Hey. I realized

06:16.100 --> 06:18.102
I needed one of these to cook.

06:20.140 --> 06:22.779
What's wrong?

06:24.750 --> 06:26.638
(short laugh)

06:26.680 --> 06:29.410
Had I not deprived myself
of sleep these last few nights,

06:29.450 --> 06:32.487
perhaps I would have realized
what was happening sooner.

06:32.520 --> 06:33.714
Captain should have told you.

06:33.760 --> 06:35.057
It would have
been indefensible

06:35.090 --> 06:37.752
for him to show me
speCIal conSIderation.

06:37.790 --> 06:40.657
But he has every confidence
that the detectives

06:40.700 --> 06:42.122
are wasting their time.
They are.

06:42.160 --> 06:45.061
I wrote that note.

06:45.100 --> 06:46.829
I was without

06:46.870 --> 06:50.658
a phone at the time.
I used street urchins

06:50.710 --> 06:52.803
to bring my correspondence
to and fro.

06:52.840 --> 06:54.501
And that makes you a killer?

06:54.540 --> 06:57.668
I feel confident

06:57.710 --> 06:59.746
that the moral maths
of my character

06:59.780 --> 07:01.645
would have prevented me
from committing a murder

07:01.680 --> 07:03.443
even in the most
altered of states.

07:03.490 --> 07:05.446
However,

07:05.490 --> 07:06.980
some of the drugs
I used during that period

07:07.020 --> 07:09.682
made me quite paranoid.

07:09.730 --> 07:11.721
Others caused hallucinations.

07:14.730 --> 07:17.096
The unfortunate truth is

07:17.130 --> 07:19.667
that however improbable
certain things may be

07:19.700 --> 07:23.158
with respect to this crime,

07:23.210 --> 07:25.599
nothing's impossible.

07:25.640 --> 07:29.178
It was a few months after Irene.

07:29.210 --> 07:31.849
You thought she was dead.
You were using more.

07:31.880 --> 07:33.677
It began as practical attempt

07:33.720 --> 07:37.542
to improve my mental horsepower.

07:37.590 --> 07:40.753
I expected to find connections
that others had missed.

07:40.790 --> 07:42.553
But as my failures mounted,

07:42.590 --> 07:44.854
so too did my cravings.

07:44.890 --> 07:48.098
And distraction turned
to crass dependence.

07:49.800 --> 07:51.597
And so began
the downward spiral.

07:51.630 --> 07:54.633
You know we're gonna
figure this out.

07:54.670 --> 07:57.207
Well, I've been asked
not to interfere.

07:57.240 --> 07:59.970
You say that like you
haven't heard it before.

08:00.010 --> 08:01.978
Never been a suspect before.

08:02.010 --> 08:04.205
Besides, we're at
a grave disadvantage.

08:04.250 --> 08:06.571
Ordinarily, the police would
share their files with us.

08:06.620 --> 08:08.042
We'd have access to evidence,
we'd have access

08:08.080 --> 08:11.709
to the victim's remains.

08:11.750 --> 08:14.218
I can't even say how I knew her.

08:14.260 --> 08:16.148
Then that's where we'll start.

08:16.190 --> 08:17.748
Watson...

08:17.790 --> 08:19.826
We _know her name.
You said you saw pictures

08:19.860 --> 08:21.623
of her with her family.
I'll talk to them.

08:21.660 --> 08:23.628
I promised the captain.

08:23.670 --> 08:26.230
I didn't.

08:26.270 --> 08:29.728
You stay here, dig into your
files, see if her name pops up.

08:29.770 --> 08:32.307
You think I knew her
through my work.

08:32.340 --> 08:33.830
How do you
know anyone?

08:33.880 --> 08:35.734
Maybe she wanted to hire you

08:35.780 --> 08:37.839
_ or she was a witness_
in a case you were working.

08:37.880 --> 08:39.711
Or maybe Gregson was right--
you just needed someone

08:39.750 --> 08:41.968
to clean this place.
Whatever the connection is,

08:42.020 --> 08:45.285
I'm telling you right now:
you did not kill that woman.

08:54.730 --> 08:58.268
Uh, Mrs. Sandoval?
Hi, I'm Joan Watson.

08:58.300 --> 08:59.995
I know who you are.

09:00.040 --> 09:02.838
Um, the detectives
from the 35th told you

09:02.870 --> 09:05.236
about me.
And your partner.

09:05.270 --> 09:07.977
I am so sorry for your loss.

09:08.010 --> 09:11.798
I can imagine how difficult
this week has been for you, but

09:11.850 --> 09:13.169
I promise you I am
only here because

09:13.220 --> 09:15.074
I want to help
find the person who killed

09:15.120 --> 09:17.748
your sister.
I don't want to talk to you.

09:17.790 --> 09:19.849
Please, do you have any idea
how Maria and Sherlock

09:19.890 --> 09:21.812
would have known each other?

09:21.860 --> 09:24.920
What do you mean how they
would have known each other?

09:24.960 --> 09:27.258
He was going through
a difficult time,

09:27.300 --> 09:28.824
he's having trouble remembering.

09:28.860 --> 09:31.363
I would want to forget
killing Maria, too.

09:31.400 --> 09:33.630
Mrs. Sandoval...
No.

09:33.670 --> 09:36.833
You ask me how they knew
each other. I don't know.

09:36.870 --> 09:38.804
She was indocumentado.

09:38.840 --> 09:40.205
Illegal.

09:40.240 --> 09:43.368
She stayed out of trouble,
she-she did her work.

09:43.410 --> 09:45.708
Went to church.

09:45.750 --> 09:47.877
But in the end,
it didn't matter.

09:47.920 --> 09:49.979
Trouble found her.

09:50.020 --> 09:52.147
Please, don't

09:52.190 --> 09:54.181
come here again.

09:56.760 --> 09:58.785
(door closes)

09:58.830 --> 10:00.798
MAN:
All right, check the

10:00.830 --> 10:02.821
stitching, get a feel for it.

10:02.870 --> 10:04.167
Huh? Nice, right?

10:04.200 --> 10:05.861
You're not gonna
find quality like that on

10:05.900 --> 10:07.629
Canal_ Street.
(sniffles)

10:08.770 --> 10:10.237
What, you don't like the color?

10:10.270 --> 10:12.909
You want to see it in red?
I got it in red.

10:16.880 --> 10:18.745
Oh, ladies, come on,
come on, don't

10:18.780 --> 10:21.669
be like that. Hey, I got
a special going on today--

10:21.720 --> 10:23.085
two for one.

10:23.120 --> 10:26.908
What, do you got a date
with Godzilla or something?

10:26.960 --> 10:29.849
Those women are from
China, not Japan.

10:29.890 --> 10:31.881
Though the racism worked,
either way.

10:34.130 --> 10:36.325
Don't suppose I can
interest you in a handbag?

10:36.360 --> 10:38.328
That depends. Does your supplier
always spell "Prada"

10:38.370 --> 10:39.667
with two Ds?

10:41.370 --> 10:43.930
(chuckles)

10:45.970 --> 10:47.938
Been a long time.

10:47.980 --> 10:50.949
Not long enough, Oscar.
Not nearly.

10:50.980 --> 10:53.949
But I need your help
with something.

10:55.850 --> 10:59.047
(chuckles)
_ I can't believe
it's been three years.

10:59.090 --> 11:00.717
Yes, well,

11:00.760 --> 11:03.923
time flies _
when you're on her0in.

11:03.960 --> 11:07.327
You look good.

11:07.360 --> 11:08.918
(chuckles)

11:08.960 --> 11:11.019
You clean?

11:11.070 --> 11:13.265
Iam.

11:13.300 --> 11:15.860
Good for you. Hey!

11:15.900 --> 11:18.733
Hey! Beat it!
Yeah, scram!

11:18.770 --> 11:21.807
We had a good
thing going on.

11:21.840 --> 11:24.047
We were a good team.
Actually,

11:24.080 --> 11:26.913
we were not a team.

11:26.950 --> 11:28.918
I was a consumer of narcotics,
and you were someone

11:28.950 --> 11:31.043
with access
to pharmaceutical-grade product.

11:31.090 --> 11:32.853
You don't call that a team?

11:32.890 --> 11:34.858
I do not.

11:34.890 --> 11:37.859
Yes, you spent a good deal
of time at my home,

11:37.890 --> 11:39.448
but that was
because you were prone

11:39.490 --> 11:40.855
to rendering yourself
unconscious.

11:40.900 --> 11:43.027
(sighs)

11:43.070 --> 11:45.322
How did it all go so wrong?

11:45.370 --> 11:47.338
Well, if memory serves, Oscar,
you let yourself in one day

11:47.370 --> 11:48.997
and made off with
several thousand dollars' worth

11:49.040 --> 11:51.964
of rare books
and computer eqUIpment.

11:55.380 --> 11:58.178
Well, you said
you needed my help?

11:58.210 --> 12:01.919
You may recall, in the weeks
prior to our parting ways,

12:01.950 --> 12:05.283
my drug use
became quite profound.

12:05.320 --> 12:09.825
Well, the price was some equally
profound holes in my memory.

12:09.860 --> 12:13.921
And no one spent more time with
me during that period than you.

12:13.960 --> 12:17.862
I would like to know
if the name Maria Gutierrez

12:17.900 --> 12:19.959
means anything to you.

12:22.810 --> 12:24.766
There's evidence to suggest
I had plans to meet with her

12:24.810 --> 12:26.778
in December of 2011...
Sherlock,

12:26.810 --> 12:29.301
of course I remember her. Maria?

12:29.340 --> 12:32.241
From the circus.
Dark hair, big...

12:32.280 --> 12:35.272
No, no, no. Th-That's Marena.
She was one of my paramours.

12:35.320 --> 12:38.289
Maria, Oscar.
Maria Gutierrez.

12:38.320 --> 12:40.311
Do you remember the name or not?

12:40.360 --> 12:42.954
Look, man, I'm sorry.

12:42.990 --> 12:46.528
You're not the only one who has
trouble remembering those days.

12:50.030 --> 12:52.362
Ah, well, this was fun.
Catching up.

12:52.400 --> 12:54.368
I got to go.

12:54.400 --> 12:57.460
Maybe we can do it again
sometime.

13:04.480 --> 13:06.539
(line ringing)

13:06.580 --> 13:10.243
HOLMES:
Watson.
I just got home. Where are you?

13:10.290 --> 13:12.417
I thought a constitutional
might jog my memory.

13:12.450 --> 13:14.509
It did not.

13:14.560 --> 13:15.913
How did you do?

13:15.960 --> 13:17.882
To be honest, not good.

13:17.930 --> 13:19.955
The guys at the 35th told
Maria's family

13:20.000 --> 13:22.195
and friends about me.
No one was in a talking mood.

13:22.230 --> 13:24.892
My files were equally fruitless.

13:24.930 --> 13:27.899
If Ms. Gutierrez was connected
to a crime I was investigating,

13:27.940 --> 13:29.430
I failed to make a note of it.

13:29.470 --> 13:32.268
Is it possible
this is some sort of frame-up?

13:32.310 --> 13:35.279
The body was so well hidden,
it took three years to discover.

13:35.310 --> 13:37.904
If it was a frame-up,
it was a very poor one.

13:37.950 --> 13:39.918
You know, I've been reading up
on articles

13:39.950 --> 13:41.941
from when she disappeared
in 2011.

13:41.980 --> 13:43.982
I know_it's not the same
as looking at police files,

13:44.020 --> 13:46.909
but something jumped out at me.

13:46.960 --> 13:50.020
She put a lot of hours in
at her church's soup kitchen.

13:50.060 --> 13:51.857
You think
she may have come across

13:51.890 --> 13:53.858
some shady characters there?

13:53.900 --> 13:56.494
Marcus is running down a list
of their frequent fliers.

13:56.530 --> 13:59.397
You brought the detective
into this?
Of course I did.

13:59.430 --> 14:01.967
He's gonna let us know
if anyone has a record.

14:02.000 --> 14:03.968
I'm almost home.
We'll discuss the matter

14:04.010 --> 14:07.229
in person.

14:12.050 --> 14:14.245
MAN:
Sherlock Holmes?

14:17.150 --> 14:19.584
Do I know you?

14:19.620 --> 14:21.383
(grunting)

14:21.420 --> 14:22.978
(alarm blaring)

14:29.430 --> 14:31.022
(moaning)

14:31.070 --> 14:33.038
Let's go. Come on. We got to go.
Come on.

14:33.070 --> 14:34.537
Let's go!

14:34.570 --> 14:36.936
(alarm continues blaring)

14:36.970 --> 14:39.063
(groans)

14:48.280 --> 14:51.249
(groans)
You know, I'd have
an easier time examining you

14:51.290 --> 14:54.657
if you would put
down your phone.
I imagine you would. Fortunately

14:54.690 --> 14:57.022
for the both of us, my wounds
are entirely superficial.

14:57.060 --> 14:59.528
There could be
internal damage.
There is not.

14:59.560 --> 15:01.994
Well, if you're in such great
shape, why did you come here?

15:03.500 --> 15:05.388
I enjoy hospitals.

15:05.430 --> 15:07.432
Especially in the middle
of the night.

15:07.470 --> 15:08.232
Doctor, if my ears
do not deceive me,

15:08.270 --> 15:09.999
a real patient
has just arrived.

15:10.040 --> 15:13.009
A man with a lightbulb
in an unfortunate place.

15:13.040 --> 15:15.702
Right.
NURSE:
Hey, we need you.

15:15.740 --> 15:18.072
Foreign body impaction. Bad one.

15:18.110 --> 15:19.702
HOLMES:
If you require
assistance,

15:19.750 --> 15:23.208
you will not find smaller or
steadier hands than Watson's.

15:27.120 --> 15:30.089
So, are you gonna call
the police, or should I?

15:30.130 --> 15:32.325
There's no need.
You were
targeted.

15:32.360 --> 15:34.521
One of the men
called you by name.

15:34.560 --> 15:36.357
And it can't be a coincidence
that you were jumped

15:36.400 --> 15:38.368
the same day you were questioned
about a homicide.

15:38.400 --> 15:40.994
I think it is a coincidence.
Though I do not disagree

15:41.040 --> 15:42.530
that the two events
are connected.

15:42.570 --> 15:45.232
Does the name Prentice Gutierrez
ring a bell?

15:45.270 --> 15:47.204
Maria's brother.
I saw his name mentioned

15:47.240 --> 15:48.502
in one of the articles I read.

15:48.540 --> 15:50.542
I couldn't track him down today.

15:50.580 --> 15:53.549
Probably because he was busy
planning an ambush.

15:53.580 --> 15:55.377
How do you know
he was one of the...

15:57.120 --> 15:59.418
There are few circumstances
more amenable

15:59.450 --> 16:01.680
to picking a man's
pocket than a thrashing.

16:01.720 --> 16:03.756
It is better to be the
thrasher, obviously,

16:03.790 --> 16:05.485
but beggars can't be choosers.

16:05.530 --> 16:07.555
An Internet search
of Mr. Gutierrez

16:07.600 --> 16:10.364
revealed nothing more than
his connection to his sister.

16:10.400 --> 16:13.631
But a police intranet search,
however...

16:15.640 --> 16:19.428
He was arrested for burgling
a home in November of 2011.

16:19.470 --> 16:21.631
That's just one month
before Maria disappeared.

16:21.680 --> 16:25.104
He insisted to anyone who would
listen that he was innocent.

16:25.150 --> 16:27.311
And you posited earlier
that Maria wished to hire me

16:27.350 --> 16:28.339
as a detective.

16:28.380 --> 16:30.348
She believed him.

16:30.390 --> 16:33.484
You were supposed to find
the person who really did it.

16:35.490 --> 16:37.355
Prentice.

16:38.390 --> 16:40.529
I know you?

16:40.560 --> 16:42.619
We had a brief
physical relationship.

16:42.660 --> 16:44.366
Perhaps this will jog
your memory.

16:45.800 --> 16:49.133
I lost this a couple
of days ago. Thanks.

16:49.170 --> 16:51.604
Mr. Gutierrez,
I bear you no ill will.

16:51.640 --> 16:53.437
You learned my name
from the detectives

16:53.480 --> 16:55.300
investigating Maria's murder,

16:55.340 --> 16:57.376
and you took matters
into your own hands.

16:57.410 --> 17:00.243
I don't know
what you're talking about.

17:00.280 --> 17:01.349
Of course
you do.

17:01.380 --> 17:02.608
Just like you know
you're on parole

17:02.650 --> 17:05.141
for that burglary charge
in 2011.

17:05.190 --> 17:08.614
An assault charge could violate
you back to prison.
It'd be worth it, though,

17:08.660 --> 17:10.628
wouldn't it?
Hurting the man who hurt Maria?

17:10.660 --> 17:14.391
The problem is, neither of us
can say with any certainty

17:14.430 --> 17:16.421
that I am that man.

17:16.460 --> 17:18.428
Right.
Because you don't remember.

17:18.470 --> 17:20.461
Or at least that's the story
you tried to sell

17:20.500 --> 17:21.762
to my other sister.

17:21.800 --> 17:23.336
The burglary.
You said you didn't do it.

17:23.370 --> 17:25.361
You got any idea who did?

17:25.410 --> 17:28.231
What the hell does that have
to do with anything?
We're investigating

17:28.280 --> 17:31.249
the possibility that Maria
wanted help finding that person.

17:31.280 --> 17:33.441
He would've had motive
to stop her.

17:33.480 --> 17:36.449
You stay away from me
and my family.

17:36.480 --> 17:38.744
Both of you.

17:42.190 --> 17:44.158
We'll go back to the station.
We'll look into burglaries

17:44.190 --> 17:45.555
that were committed
around that time.

17:45.590 --> 17:48.650
We might be able to find
a suspect without his help.

17:49.660 --> 17:52.299
(whirring, clicking)

17:54.440 --> 17:56.499
So, we're onto something,
though, aren't we?

17:56.540 --> 17:58.167
You know who committed
the burglary.

17:58.210 --> 17:59.802
You have until I finish
replacing these brake pads.

17:59.840 --> 18:01.808
If you're still here
when I turn around,

18:01.840 --> 18:04.479
I'm the one who's gonna
be calling the cops.
Mr. Gutierrez...

18:04.510 --> 18:06.842
Come on. Let's go.
It occurs to me,
you know,

18:06.880 --> 18:09.110
that any one of these tools

18:09.150 --> 18:11.448
could've been the end of me
last night.

18:11.490 --> 18:12.718
But you attacked me

18:12.750 --> 18:15.514
with ﬁsts
and with booted feet.

18:15.560 --> 18:18.723
So you didn't want to kill me.
You just wanted to hurt me.

18:18.760 --> 18:20.728
Do you want to do it again?

18:21.730 --> 18:23.288
What are you
talking about?

18:23.330 --> 18:24.592
I'm talking
about reciprocity.

18:24.630 --> 18:26.461
I'm talking
about quid pro quo.

18:28.340 --> 18:31.867
If you submit to my questions...

18:31.910 --> 18:35.277
I'll submit to a blow
from this wrench.

18:39.550 --> 18:43.680
You're not certain
that I hurt Maria, are you?

18:43.720 --> 18:46.382
If you're open to suggestions,

18:46.420 --> 18:47.853
I offer my hand.

18:47.890 --> 18:50.688
(clanging)

18:50.730 --> 18:53.290
Come on. You're gonna break
any number of bones.

18:53.330 --> 18:54.695
The pain's gonna be
excruciating.

18:54.730 --> 18:55.492
Sherlock...

19:07.710 --> 19:09.473
I did the burglary.

19:09.510 --> 19:11.341
I did it.

19:11.380 --> 19:13.416
And Maria knew it. I told her.
So you're wrong

19:13.450 --> 19:17.409
about her wanting you to find
the person who really did it.

19:17.450 --> 19:19.486
If she wanted your help,

19:19.520 --> 19:22.489
it didn't have anything to do
with that.

19:22.520 --> 19:24.329
WATSON:
Can you think

19:24.360 --> 19:26.419
of anyone who would've wanted
to hurt her?

19:29.900 --> 19:32.619
(sighs)
You know she cleaned, right?

19:32.670 --> 19:35.594
The year she went
missing, there was a guy

19:35.640 --> 19:38.200
she worked for who owned
a couple of buildings in Queens,

19:38.240 --> 19:40.674
and one of them was being rented
by a-a councilman

19:40.710 --> 19:42.598
who was running for reelection.

19:42.640 --> 19:44.244
Uh, Barclay.

19:44.280 --> 19:46.601
She told me that someone
there was hitting on her,

19:46.650 --> 19:48.345
that-that it made
her uncomfortable.

19:48.380 --> 19:50.439
Did she tell you the man's name?
No.

19:50.490 --> 19:52.446
Because she was worried that
I might do something stupid.

19:52.490 --> 19:54.754
And you know what?
She was right. I would have.

19:54.790 --> 19:57.554
I told the police
after she went missing.

19:57.590 --> 19:59.854
They said they looked into it
but that it was a dead end,

19:59.890 --> 20:01.994
that the guy had an alibi.

20:02.030 --> 20:03.668
According to them.

20:03.700 --> 20:06.726
According to them.

20:10.470 --> 20:12.836
HOLMES:
Councilman Barclay would appear

20:12.870 --> 20:14.838
as a friend of the department.

20:14.880 --> 20:17.440
Perhaps the police
who were investigating

20:17.480 --> 20:18.549
Prentice's claim that his sister

20:18.580 --> 20:20.377
was being harassed
didn't encounter

20:20.420 --> 20:22.775
a dead end
so much as a "do not enter."

20:22.820 --> 20:26.483
What are you saying? That this
was some sort of cover-up?

20:26.520 --> 20:28.488
Well, if there was,
it would be a turn up for us.

20:28.520 --> 20:29.885
Conspiracies are fraught.

20:29.920 --> 20:33.595
One secret versus
many keepers.

20:33.630 --> 20:35.552
There'd be no shortage
of new leads.

20:37.770 --> 20:39.795
You were gonna let him do it,

20:39.830 --> 20:41.695
weren't you?

20:41.740 --> 20:43.332
Maria's brother-- _
you were gonna let him

20:43.370 --> 20:44.667
hit you with that wrench.

20:47.010 --> 20:49.035
WOMAN:
Excuse me.

20:49.080 --> 20:51.947
The councilman will see you now.

20:51.980 --> 20:54.574
I didn't know Maria well,
but she was sweet.

20:54.620 --> 20:57.589
I spent a lot of late nights
here during the campaign.

20:57.620 --> 20:59.508
I'd see her
when she'd come in to clean,

20:59.550 --> 21:01.609
and she'd ask
how I was holding up.

21:01.660 --> 21:04.356
When... Maria_
was reported missmg,

21:04.390 --> 21:07.723
I'd hoped that she'd
just gone back to her country,

21:07.760 --> 21:11.025
but... I'd been around
too many cops for too many years

21:11.070 --> 21:13.664
to really
believe that.
It's our understanding that

21:13.700 --> 21:16.692
one of your reelection team was
briefly considered a suspect.

21:16.740 --> 21:18.765
That's right.

21:21.580 --> 21:23.969
I'm sorry, it's just...

21:24.010 --> 21:26.808
I've been advised
not to talk to you.

21:26.850 --> 21:29.978
You are aware that
I'm a person of interest.

21:30.020 --> 21:32.079
BARCLAY:
Even though Maria
wasn't a member

21:32.120 --> 21:34.759
of my team, what happened
to her affected us.

21:34.790 --> 21:36.087
I've been keeping myself

21:36.120 --> 21:38.429
apprised.
I'm confused.

21:38.460 --> 21:40.052
Why did you agree to see us?

21:40.090 --> 21:41.591
Because...

21:41.630 --> 21:43.723
I'm also a fan.

21:43.770 --> 21:45.658
The administrative
hearing last year,

21:45.700 --> 21:48.737
you had to make your case
to stay on with the department.

21:48.770 --> 21:51.898
A lot of people wanted you gone,
but I looked into you.

21:51.940 --> 21:54.670
And the more I discovered,
the more impressed I was.

21:54.710 --> 21:57.599
If you say
you didn't hurt Maria,

21:57.650 --> 21:59.470
I'm inclined to believe you.

21:59.510 --> 22:01.842
Well, thank you.
It's true,

22:01.880 --> 22:04.747
M-Maria was being
harassed by someone

22:04.790 --> 22:06.644
who worked here.

22:06.690 --> 22:09.614
My deputy press secretary--
a man named Tom Graves.

22:09.660 --> 22:13.357
He propositioned her
on several occasions.

22:13.400 --> 22:16.028
_ I wasn't aware _
until the police questioned him

22:16.060 --> 22:17.561
about her disappearance.

22:17.600 --> 22:19.966
We were told he was cleared.

22:20.000 --> 22:23.094
He was out of the state
the night Maria went missmg.

22:23.140 --> 22:25.938
I was told there was a video
of him at his hotel.

22:25.970 --> 22:28.507
I still fired him, of course.

22:28.540 --> 22:30.747
Hmm. So much for the cover-up.

22:30.780 --> 22:31.940
Like I said,

22:31.980 --> 22:33.709
I have a sense for how you work.

22:33.750 --> 22:35.775
I know you make a habit
of catching things

22:35.820 --> 22:37.139
other people have missed.

22:37.180 --> 22:39.114
I'll give you
everything

22:39.150 --> 22:41.482
I gave the police
in 2011.

22:41.520 --> 22:44.159
If Tom got away
with something...

22:44.190 --> 22:47.125
maybe you'll be able
to figure out how.

22:47.160 --> 22:49.424
WATSON :
Hey.

22:49.460 --> 22:52.520
I thought you said you
were going for a walk
to clear your head.

22:52.570 --> 22:54.834
It should trouble you
how often you believe that.

22:54.870 --> 22:56.531
What is this?

22:56.570 --> 22:57.969
Upon our
verification

22:58.010 --> 23:01.434
of the alibi of Tom Graves,
randy press secretary,

23:01.480 --> 23:04.108
I've decided to attack this case
as I would any other.

23:04.150 --> 23:06.141
It is not
utterly dev0id of fact,

23:06.180 --> 23:08.375
and there is even
a strong suspect.

23:10.790 --> 23:13.088
WATSON:
Is that a picture of you?

23:13.120 --> 23:14.587
HOLMES:
I took that one

23:14.620 --> 23:16.053
by accident several years ago.

23:16.090 --> 23:18.752
I was in an altered state,
and I mishandled my phone.

23:18.790 --> 23:20.724
God only knows what
I intended to photograph.

23:20.760 --> 23:23.058
If you really want
to beat yourself up...

23:23.100 --> 23:25.159
You think this is
an exercise in self-pity.

23:25.200 --> 23:26.792
I think this is an Olympics
in self-pity.

23:26.830 --> 23:28.161
First you tell
Prentice Gutierrez

23:28.200 --> 23:29.997
he can break your hand,
and now you're

23:30.040 --> 23:32.429
sitting in the dark staring at
an old photograph of yourself.

23:32.470 --> 23:35.075
You did not kill that woman--
stop acting like you did.

23:35.110 --> 23:37.806
You are positive I didn't do it.

23:37.850 --> 23:39.442
Of course I am.
How?

23:39.480 --> 23:40.811
Because I know you.

23:40.850 --> 23:42.477
Yes. Better than anyone.

23:42.520 --> 23:44.886
But let make one thing
perfectly clear.

23:44.920 --> 23:46.842
You did not know him.

23:46.890 --> 23:48.118
You never

23:48.160 --> 23:49.787
met him.

23:49.820 --> 23:51.526
So you're Dr. Jelqll now

23:51.560 --> 23:53.084
and he's Mr. Hyde?

23:53.130 --> 23:55.849
You continue to misunderstand.
At that pomt in my life,

23:55.900 --> 23:58.869
I did not plumb down
into some dark part of myself.

23:58.900 --> 24:02.461
I detached from myself, from
all that was essential to me.

24:02.500 --> 24:04.036
To say that you
can guess what I was

24:04.070 --> 24:06.231
capable of is illogical--
I was a different person.

24:06.270 --> 24:09.034
And the fact that I remember
so little from that time

24:09.080 --> 24:11.776
has been nothing
but a tremendous relief to me

24:11.810 --> 24:13.846
until now!

24:16.220 --> 24:18.541
I'm sorry, okay?

24:18.590 --> 24:20.649
I know it hurts,

24:20.690 --> 24:21.509
but there is nothing
you can say that's gonna

24:21.560 --> 24:22.857
convince me that
you killed that woman.

24:22.890 --> 24:24.824
Let's adhere
to our sunniest theory

24:24.860 --> 24:26.122
for a moment, shall we?

24:26.160 --> 24:27.821
That my note to Maria Gutierrez

24:27.860 --> 24:29.828
was not, in fact,
an invitation to murder,

24:29.860 --> 24:32.727
but an agreement
to lend my help
as a detective.

24:32.770 --> 24:34.590
What if she knew
she was in danger?

24:34.640 --> 24:35.959
And what if I missed something

24:36.000 --> 24:37.934
that my sober self
would have observed

24:37.970 --> 24:41.007
in an instant
that might have saved her life?

24:41.040 --> 24:44.840
Would you still consider
my hands blood-free?

24:44.880 --> 24:47.041
(phone ringing)

24:52.890 --> 24:55.085
(phone continues ringing)

24:57.090 --> 24:58.887
WATSON:
Hey, Marcus.

24:58.930 --> 25:00.625
Hey. I ran that list of regulars

25:00.660 --> 25:03.220
from the soup kitchen where
Maria Gutierrez volunteered.

25:03.260 --> 25:06.024
Got back about two dozen names
with arrest records.

25:06.070 --> 25:07.799
I just e-mailed them over.

25:07.840 --> 25:10.638
No one jumps out, but they all
seem worth talking to.

25:10.670 --> 25:12.137
I cleared my morning
to help out.

25:12.170 --> 25:14.604
Figured I'll take
the first ten or 12 guys.

25:14.640 --> 25:16.801
Thank you, Detective.
That won't be necessary.

25:16.840 --> 25:18.705
Why did you
just do that?

25:18.750 --> 25:20.911
Because a meaningful connection
between Maria Gutierrez

25:20.950 --> 25:22.975
and myself
has just materialized.

25:23.020 --> 25:25.887
I recognize a name
on this list.

25:30.190 --> 25:32.158
(knocking)

25:32.190 --> 25:33.919
Go away.

25:33.960 --> 25:35.291
(knocking)

25:35.330 --> 25:38.026
(sighs)
Are you deaf? I said go away!

25:42.000 --> 25:44.798
(panting): Aw, man,
you busted my door.

25:44.840 --> 25:45.966
That might be the highlight

25:46.010 --> 25:48.729
of this encounter, Oscar.
You lied to me.

25:48.780 --> 25:51.669
You told me you did not
know Maria Gutierrez--
it's come to my attention

25:51.710 --> 25:54.270
that you were a regular
at the soup kitchen
where she worked.

25:54.320 --> 25:56.174
What?
St. Luke's Parish.

25:56.220 --> 25:58.643
You tell me
you never supped there.

25:58.690 --> 26:01.352
Yeah, yeah, sure I did,
I still do, but...

26:01.390 --> 26:05.053
Come on, man, what, you think I
remember every person that ever

26:05.090 --> 26:06.819
worked there?
I think a connection
between you

26:06.860 --> 26:08.919
and the_ woman _I'm accused of
murdering is qUIte remarkable.

26:08.960 --> 26:10.825
I think the fact
that you lied to me

26:10.870 --> 26:11.962
about it is rather suspicious.

26:12.000 --> 26:13.228
Come on, Sherlock, please,

26:13.270 --> 26:14.965
I'm sick.
YouTe
in withdrawal,

26:15.000 --> 26:16.729
and that's good--
it's going to make it

26:16.770 --> 26:18.032
more difficult for you
to deceive me again.

26:18.070 --> 26:20.971
WATSON: Where were you
the night Maria disappeared?

26:21.010 --> 26:24.776
(laughs):
Oh, what, you think I did it?

26:24.810 --> 26:27.074
Come on, Sherlock,
that's crazy.

26:27.110 --> 26:29.374
Tell us about the note, Oscar.

26:29.420 --> 26:31.149
What note?!
WATSON:
The one found

26:31.190 --> 26:33.112
in Maria's purse--
the one that said

26:33.150 --> 26:34.651
Sherlock was
gonna meet with her.

26:34.690 --> 26:36.988
Did you trick her
into writing it?

26:37.020 --> 26:38.829
(pants)

26:38.860 --> 26:40.259
(chuckles quietly)

26:40.290 --> 26:42.827
You really don't remember,
do you?

26:42.860 --> 26:45.624
Remember what?

26:45.670 --> 26:48.332
You killed her, man.

26:48.370 --> 26:50.759
You!

26:50.810 --> 26:52.835
Yeah, I bet
you feel

26:52.870 --> 26:54.804
pretty big
these last couple of years--

26:54.840 --> 26:57.400
off the horse,
back on the job, all clean

26:57.440 --> 26:58.839
and pretty.

26:58.880 --> 27:00.643
Only you weren't,
were you?

27:00.680 --> 27:03.410
No, you had dirt
on you! Blood!

27:03.450 --> 27:05.839
Yeah, you always thought
you were better than me,

27:05.890 --> 27:08.779
even when you were using,
but now you know-- you're not.

27:08.820 --> 27:10.310
You're worse.

27:10.360 --> 27:14.091
I may be a bum and a junkie,
but I never killed anyone.

27:14.130 --> 27:17.099
You will tell me
everything that you know.

27:17.130 --> 27:18.427
All right,
yeah, man.

27:18.470 --> 27:20.062
Yeah, sure.
You know, get a pen.

27:20.100 --> 27:23.035
Let me make it easier for you
to pin it all on me.

27:23.070 --> 27:26.107
You want my advice?
Let it go.

27:26.140 --> 27:28.904
(panting):
If all the police have
is a note...

27:28.940 --> 27:31.170
count your blessings.

27:36.250 --> 27:38.218
Watson.
We're leavmg?

27:38.250 --> 27:40.343
Yes. This is not over.

27:40.390 --> 27:42.187
It'd better be,
or trust me,

27:42.220 --> 27:45.189
you're gonna spend
the rest of your life in a cell!

28:01.940 --> 28:05.842
You haven't said
much since we got back.

28:05.880 --> 28:09.372
I have a plan,
if you want to hear it.

28:09.420 --> 28:11.217
We meet
with the captain first thing.

28:11.250 --> 28:13.718
We tell him everything.
He brings Oscar in.

28:13.760 --> 28:15.057
If Oscar's still sick,

28:15.090 --> 28:17.183
it might not
take him long to crack.

28:17.220 --> 28:18.949
Your plan is flawed.

28:18.990 --> 28:21.754
He will not crack
because he did not do it.

28:21.800 --> 28:24.394
He's been_convicted
of purse-snatching and assault.

28:24.430 --> 28:27.797
Probably tried to rip Maria off;
she fought back.
No.

28:27.840 --> 28:29.364
His withdrawal symptoms,
as predicted,

28:29.400 --> 28:31.004
made him utterly readable.

28:31.040 --> 28:33.736
He was telling the truth
when he said I did it.

28:33.780 --> 28:35.975
Are you saying you believe him?
I'm saying

28:36.010 --> 28:38.843
I believe that he believes
I'm the guilty party.

28:38.880 --> 28:40.745
He's either correct
or he's laboring

28:40.780 --> 28:42.316
under a horrific
misconception.

28:42.350 --> 28:45.217
Either way, he did not do it.

28:45.250 --> 28:48.413
He will not crack.
Your plan is flawed.

28:51.790 --> 28:55.055
Sorry if I upset you
this morning.

28:55.100 --> 28:57.864
At the garage with the wrench.

28:59.870 --> 29:02.259
It's okay.

29:04.210 --> 29:06.770
It's a form of torture...

29:06.810 --> 29:09.370
having to swim
through my old life.

29:11.880 --> 29:13.006
I know that over the years,

29:13.050 --> 29:14.779
you've suffered
your own travails

29:14.820 --> 29:16.947
and you can relate
to a profound sense of guilt.

29:19.090 --> 29:23.083
You cannot relate
to a profound sense of shame.

29:24.960 --> 29:26.951
(doorbell rings)

29:28.400 --> 29:30.960
(indistinct radio transmission)

29:31.000 --> 29:32.888
Detectives.

29:32.930 --> 29:34.898
Mr. Holmes.

29:34.940 --> 29:36.134
What is it? What's going on?

29:37.910 --> 29:39.866
Isn't it obvious?

29:39.910 --> 29:41.172
I'm being arrested.

29:41.210 --> 29:42.973
Sherlock Holmes,

29:43.010 --> 29:45.171
you're under arrest for
the murder of Maria Gutierrez.

29:45.210 --> 29:47.075
You have the right
to remain silent

29:47.110 --> 29:47.940
and refuse_
to answer questions.

29:47.980 --> 29:50.346
Anything you say
may be used against you

29:50.380 --> 29:51.813
in a court of law.

29:58.090 --> 30:00.991
All I could get
out of my buddy at the 3-5

30:01.030 --> 30:03.055
was that some new witness
came forward.

30:03.100 --> 30:05.022
Someone who _said _
they saw Sherlock kill Maria?

30:05.070 --> 30:07.368
No, someone who says
they heard him threaten her life

30:07.400 --> 30:08.890
a few days
before she disappeared.

30:08.940 --> 30:10.999
I don't believe it.

30:11.040 --> 30:13.031
The guys at
the 3-5 do.

30:13.070 --> 30:16.278
Right now,
that's all that matters.
I don't suppose

30:16.310 --> 30:18.107
you were able
to put a name to the witness.

30:18.150 --> 30:19.401
They're keeping
everything

30:19.450 --> 30:21.839
under wraps. Like they should.

30:21.880 --> 30:24.019
Holmes is not a cop,
but he's close.

30:24.050 --> 30:25.984
They got to protect their case.

30:26.020 --> 30:29.114
You have any luck with that list
I sent you last night?

30:29.160 --> 30:30.980
We did.
Sherlock knew one of the names.

30:31.030 --> 30:32.486
We talked to the guy.

30:32.530 --> 30:34.919
Is it someone you like
for theNmurder?
o.

30:34.960 --> 30:39.021
But I'm pretty sure another
conversation is in order.

30:41.970 --> 30:43.938
You don't look sick anymore,
Oscar.

30:43.970 --> 30:46.962
I'm guessing you scored
last night?
(chuckles)

30:47.010 --> 30:49.399
You know, I never got your name.
Joan.

30:49.440 --> 30:50.998
I work with Sherlock.

30:51.050 --> 30:53.245
Hi, Joan. Uh...

30:53.280 --> 30:55.510
you here with some money
for a new door?

30:55.550 --> 30:57.347
No, I'm here because I know
you're the witness

30:57.380 --> 30:58.984
who got Sherlock arrested.

30:59.020 --> 30:59.987
What?
Okay,

31:00.020 --> 31:02.079
I want to know
what you told them right now.

31:02.120 --> 31:04.987
Wait a second. Wait a second.
Sherlock's in jail?
Okay,

31:05.030 --> 31:07.055
don't, Oscar. You threatened
him, you told him he was
gonna go to prison.

31:07.090 --> 31:11.527
Oh, no. No, this is bad.

31:11.570 --> 31:13.526
If you don't start telling the
truth, it's gonna get worse.

31:13.570 --> 31:16.266
No, you don't get it. It's bad
for both of us, him and me.

31:16.300 --> 31:19.007
Look, I said what I said
to scare him off.

31:19.040 --> 31:21.235
The last thing I wanted
was for him to get arrested.

31:21.280 --> 31:23.100
How is this bad for you?

31:23.140 --> 31:25.938
I didn't do it, okay? He did.

31:25.980 --> 31:29.040
But he can take me down
with him.
Listen,

31:29.080 --> 31:31.981
whatever really happened three
years ago, I will help you.

31:32.020 --> 31:33.988
But first you need to tell me

31:34.020 --> 31:36.284
why you think
Sherlock killed Maria.

31:36.320 --> 31:38.220
I'll do you one better.

31:38.260 --> 31:41.149
I'll show you.

31:41.200 --> 31:42.428
Sherlock was right.

31:42.460 --> 31:44.121
I did know Maria
from the soup kitchen.

31:44.170 --> 31:45.922
She was beautiful.

31:45.970 --> 31:47.392
I was a bum, and
she talked to me.

31:47.430 --> 31:50.160
She talked to all of us.

31:50.200 --> 31:53.203
I bragged a couple times that my
buddy was this big private eye.

31:53.240 --> 31:55.379
She'd laugh, and then, one
day, she said she had a problem.

31:55.410 --> 31:56.968
She asked if he could help.

31:57.010 --> 31:58.546
What was the problem?
I don't know.

31:58.580 --> 32:00.104
She would only
tell Sherlock.

32:00.150 --> 32:01.447
So I went to him,

32:01.480 --> 32:03.072
said I knew someone
who wanted to talk to him.

32:03.120 --> 32:05.315
But he was in a bad way,
had been for weeks.

32:05.350 --> 32:07.011
But he said he would meet her.

32:07.050 --> 32:08.187
That's what the note was about?

32:08.220 --> 32:10.154
The one found in
Maria's purse?

32:10.190 --> 32:12.055
I don't know.
I guess.

32:12.090 --> 32:15.298
Few days later,
I hear she's missing.

32:15.330 --> 32:19.164
I go see Sherlock,
and he's wasted.

32:19.200 --> 32:20.997
Can't wake him up.
And I'm nervous,

32:21.040 --> 32:24.066
looking around
for more of whatever he's on.

32:24.110 --> 32:26.999
Instead of his stash...

32:27.040 --> 32:29.929
I find this.

32:33.210 --> 32:37.749
Look, for what it's worth,
I don't think he meant to do it.

32:37.780 --> 32:39.543
No, I just think
he was confused.

32:39.590 --> 32:41.182
That happens sometimes.

32:41.220 --> 32:42.380
One night I crashed with him,

32:42.420 --> 32:44.251
I woke up, and he had
a knife to my throat.

32:44.290 --> 32:45.655
Kept saying I was
a spy or something.

32:45.690 --> 32:47.726
So, you hid these
here to protect him?

32:47.760 --> 32:49.159
No, protect us.

32:49.200 --> 32:51.020
I mean, I had a record.
I set up the meeting.

32:51.070 --> 32:53.265
Think the cops won't come
after me as an accessory?

32:53.300 --> 32:55.097
Yeah, so I took the bag
and, you know, a few things

32:55.140 --> 32:56.698
that I could pawn,
and that was that.

32:56.740 --> 33:00.130
I didn't see Sherlock again,
you know, until a few days ago.

33:00.170 --> 33:01.706
Why didn't you just
get rid of the bag?

33:01.740 --> 33:05.107
In case he ever came after me
for the stuff I stole

33:05.150 --> 33:07.209
or to blame me
for what he did to Maria.

33:07.250 --> 33:10.139
Hey, this was insurance.

33:10.180 --> 33:12.114
Look, I'm sorry if that's not
what you wanted to hear,

33:12.150 --> 33:13.447
but that's the truth.

33:13.490 --> 33:15.287
I believe you.

33:15.320 --> 33:16.685
Who are you calling?

33:16.720 --> 33:18.756
Friend at the 11th.

33:18.790 --> 33:21.293
You're gonna give this stuff
to the cops?

33:21.330 --> 33:23.594
Hey, this shirt,
these pants--

33:23.630 --> 33:26.269
they're the end of Sherlock.
You get that, right?

33:26.300 --> 33:28.336
Actually, I think you're wrong.
I think they're gonna help him.

33:28.370 --> 33:31.100
(line ringing)

33:43.350 --> 33:45.545
It's interesting, Watson,
spending the night in a cell.

33:45.590 --> 33:48.787
(clears throat)
I'm reminded that there are
good places for bad people.

33:48.820 --> 33:52.256
Is that what you are now--
a bad person?

33:53.560 --> 33:55.653
You've been to see Oscar.

33:55.700 --> 33:58.328
Or you yourself
have been cooking heroin?

33:58.370 --> 34:02.329
May I assume he's the
witness who told Detectives

34:02.370 --> 34:04.702
Demps and McShane that I had
threatened Maria Gutierrez?

34:04.740 --> 34:07.538
Actually, no.

34:07.570 --> 34:09.401
He took this clothing
out of your place

34:09.440 --> 34:11.579
a few days
after Maria disappeared.

34:11.610 --> 34:15.148
Do you recognize them?

34:15.180 --> 34:17.375
He thought you were wearing them
when you killed her,

34:17.420 --> 34:20.287
but the sizes are wrong, and
the bloodstain pattern suggests

34:20.320 --> 34:22.754
it was worn by someone
who committed a stabbing murder.

34:22.790 --> 34:25.486
Maria died from blunt force
trauma to the skull.

34:25.530 --> 34:29.591
You believe these are evidence
for an entirely different crime?

34:29.630 --> 34:32.292
Maria told Oscar
she had a problem

34:32.330 --> 34:33.729
and needed your help.

34:33.770 --> 34:35.658
What if these were the problem?

34:35.700 --> 34:37.497
Maybe they were at your place

34:37.540 --> 34:39.303
because she gave them to you.

34:39.340 --> 34:41.399
Maybe she knew about a murder
and got her hands on these.

34:41.440 --> 34:44.307
Instead of bringing them
to the police,

34:44.350 --> 34:46.568
she brought them to me,
heroin addict.

34:46.610 --> 34:48.749
She was in the country

34:48.780 --> 34:50.668
illegally and probably
worried about being deported.

34:50.720 --> 34:52.483
Either way,
the killer found her,

34:52.520 --> 34:55.284
Oscar took the clothes, and
you forgot you ever had them.

34:55.320 --> 34:56.651
Just like you forgot about her.

34:56.690 --> 34:59.329
Now Marcus and the captain
are looking into

34:59.360 --> 35:01.191
stabbing deaths around the time
that she disappeared.

35:01.230 --> 35:03.653
If we can find one that connects
back to her in any way--

35:03.700 --> 35:06.396
a person that she knew, a place
where she spent a lot of time...

35:06.430 --> 35:08.295
We might be able
to identify the real killer.

35:10.270 --> 35:12.329
Your search will need to extend

35:12.370 --> 35:14.235
to missing persons, as well.

35:14.280 --> 35:16.339
If the killer hid the body
of his second victim,

35:16.380 --> 35:19.372
Maria, it stands to reason he
also hid the body of his first.

35:21.420 --> 35:23.877
Good news is, I might be able

35:23.920 --> 35:25.911
to narrow that search
con5iderably for you.

35:25.950 --> 35:28.259
What do you mean?

35:28.290 --> 35:29.518
I was wrong.

35:29.560 --> 35:31.289
I do recognize that shirt,

35:31.330 --> 35:33.423
but not from three years ago.

35:33.460 --> 35:35.394
The shirt has a double
cuff at the wrist.

35:35.430 --> 35:37.352
The inlay on the buttons
is rather distinctive.

35:37.400 --> 35:39.368
I've seen it recently.

35:40.630 --> 35:44.134
I believe I know
who's behind all of this.

35:58.320 --> 36:00.379
Councilman Barclay,
Tommy Gregson.

36:00.420 --> 36:02.388
We met at a fund-raiser
a few years ago?

36:02.420 --> 36:03.785
Ah, of course.

36:03.820 --> 36:05.549
It's great to
see you again.

36:05.590 --> 36:08.457
This is Detective Bell, and, uh,

36:08.500 --> 36:10.821
you know Ms. Watson.
Of course.

36:10.860 --> 36:13.465
There have been some new
developments in Maria's case.

36:13.500 --> 36:15.661
We were hoping
we could discuss them with you.

36:17.570 --> 36:19.731
Oh, tell me,
how can I help you?

36:19.770 --> 36:22.739
A new witness _
came forward last night.

36:22.780 --> 36:26.375
He told police that he saw
Sherlock threaten Maria.

36:26.410 --> 36:27.843
Oh, I hadn't heard.

36:27.880 --> 36:30.678
Is the name Eddie
Bynum familiar to you?

36:30.720 --> 36:32.745
I don't think so.

36:32.790 --> 36:34.417
Why?

36:34.460 --> 36:35.916
Because he's the witness.

36:35.960 --> 36:38.281
He's also a site foreman
at Hatano Construction.

36:38.330 --> 36:40.252
You know his boss,
Matthew Hatano.

36:40.290 --> 36:43.589
They've handled the majority
of the Section 8 housing

36:43.630 --> 36:45.564
developments in your
district the last few years.

36:45.600 --> 36:46.999
Okay.

36:47.030 --> 36:48.429
You steered a lot
of busmess

36:48.470 --> 36:50.688
their way--
a couple of million at least.

36:50.740 --> 36:54.232
If you had asked for a favor,
it'd be hard to say no.

36:54.280 --> 36:57.602
I'm sorry.
I'm not following.

36:57.640 --> 36:59.744
You don't know
Eddie Bynum. Okay.

36:59.780 --> 37:01.475
What about Kelsey Prior?

37:03.750 --> 37:06.389
Captain, I'm not sure
what this is,

37:06.420 --> 37:08.388
but I'd like the three of you
to leave.

37:08.420 --> 37:11.321
I need to place a call
to the commissioner.

37:11.360 --> 37:14.022
If it's about us being here,
I'll save you the trouble.

37:14.060 --> 37:16.858
He knows.
WATSON:
Kelsey Prior, Councilman.

37:16.900 --> 37:18.788
You knew her, right?

37:21.800 --> 37:23.768
She was a...

37:23.800 --> 37:25.836
She was the wife
of a dear friend.

37:25.870 --> 37:27.804
She was stabbed to
death in her home

37:27.840 --> 37:29.705
in December, 2011.

37:29.740 --> 37:33.039
It looked like a robbery gone
wrong, only it wasn't, was it?

37:33.080 --> 37:35.719
Friend of hers thought
she was having an affair.

37:35.750 --> 37:38.310
The detectives
who caught the case

37:38.350 --> 37:39.385
couldn't find
any evidence of that.

37:39.420 --> 37:41.308
We're guessing

37:41.360 --> 37:42.554
you were pretty careful.

37:42.590 --> 37:43.989
You had a lot to lose,
after all ;

37:44.020 --> 37:45.521
you were trying
to get reelected.

37:45.560 --> 37:47.687
This is ridiculous.

37:47.730 --> 37:49.459
Why don't you tell
us what happened?

37:49.500 --> 37:51.798
Did she try to break it off?

37:51.830 --> 37:53.468
Threaten
to go public?

37:53.500 --> 37:55.491
BELL:
Whatever it was,

37:55.540 --> 37:57.064
you stabbed
her to death.

37:57.100 --> 37:59.409
You had her blood all over you,
so instead of going home

37:59.440 --> 38:01.374
to your wife,
you came here, to your office.

38:01.410 --> 38:03.503
Told our colleagues
you spend a lot of nights here.

38:03.540 --> 38:04.643
Probably had
a change of clothes.

38:04.680 --> 38:06.045
Problem was,

38:06.080 --> 38:07.741
you weren't alone.

38:07.780 --> 38:10.772
Maria saw you getting rid
of the evidence, right?

38:10.820 --> 38:12.515
Maybe you took it somewhere

38:12.550 --> 38:13.983
and she followed.

38:14.020 --> 38:16.887
Or maybe you dumped it
right here at the office.

38:16.920 --> 38:19.627
Either way, she got
her hands on it.

38:21.500 --> 38:22.649
BELL:
You must've gotten nervous.

38:22.700 --> 38:24.520
Decided you wanted to dispose of

38:24.570 --> 38:26.367
the bloody clothes
some other way.

38:26.400 --> 38:28.732
But when you went to retrieve
them, they were gone.

38:28.770 --> 38:30.362
You thought of Maria.

38:32.570 --> 38:34.572
I'm calling my attorney.
WATSON:
Before you do,

38:34.610 --> 38:36.100
you should know
we have the clothes.

38:36.140 --> 38:38.608
Shenock
remembered

38:38.650 --> 38:41.778
seeing them in a picture when
we were here the other day.

38:41.820 --> 38:43.447
They don't connect you
to Maria's murder,

38:43.480 --> 38:44.481
but they do connect you
to Kelsey's.

38:44.520 --> 38:46.488
Four years ago,
police were able

38:46.520 --> 38:48.112
to determine that
the killer's hand

38:48.150 --> 38:50.084
slipped over the hilt of
the knife when he stabbed her.

38:50.120 --> 38:53.453
He cut himself, leaving
blood at the scene.

38:53.490 --> 38:55.799
When we compel
a DNA sample from you,

38:55.830 --> 38:57.525
it's going to match.

38:57.560 --> 38:59.824
Between that
and Eddie Bynum,

38:59.870 --> 39:02.589
who I'm confident
is gomg to tell us

39:02.640 --> 39:05.507
his boss put him up to giving
a false statement last night,

39:05.540 --> 39:07.838
you might want
to tell your attorney

39:07.870 --> 39:10.475
he's got his work
cut out for him.

39:18.950 --> 39:21.111
WATSON:
The witness, Eddie Bynum,
folded pretty quickly.

39:21.150 --> 39:22.549
So did Matthew Hatano.

39:22.590 --> 39:24.854
When the councilman saw
the writing on the wall,

39:24.890 --> 39:26.084
he told us everything.

39:26.130 --> 39:27.654
He did kill Kelsey Prior,

39:27.690 --> 39:30.022
and then, a few nights later,
he killed Maria.

39:30.060 --> 39:33.029
The same night I met with her.

39:33.070 --> 39:34.628
Was he following her?

39:34.670 --> 39:36.888
He never knew
about you.

39:36.940 --> 39:39.101
What he did,
he did a few hours later.

39:39.140 --> 39:40.562
He went to her place.

39:40.610 --> 39:42.475
She wasn't there,
so he called her.

39:42.510 --> 39:44.876
He said he could
explain everything.

39:44.910 --> 39:46.605
It was just one
big misunderstanding.

39:46.650 --> 39:48.538
He told her if she
agreed to meet with him,

39:48.580 --> 39:50.810
he could pull some strings
at the department.

39:50.850 --> 39:52.078
Get her brother
out from under

39:52.120 --> 39:53.519
the burglary charge
he was facing.

39:53.550 --> 39:54.949
She believed him.

39:54.990 --> 39:58.016
He picked her up at the
Frobisher Motel in Bayside.

40:00.530 --> 40:04.159
I remembered the name_from
some of your old case files.

40:04.200 --> 40:07.419
I know that on
at least two occasions,

40:07.470 --> 40:09.665
you stashed witnesses there
you thought were in danger.

40:12.670 --> 40:14.001
The other night,
you said you were worried

40:14.040 --> 40:15.701
you might have
missed something.

40:15.740 --> 40:18.903
Something you would've noticed
if you were sober.

40:18.950 --> 40:20.702
I don't think
you missed anything.

40:22.480 --> 40:24.948
No, I just forgot someone
who needed my help.

40:31.960 --> 40:33.154
Where are you going?

40:33.190 --> 40:36.125
Walk.

40:36.160 --> 40:37.752
It should
trouble me, right?

40:37.800 --> 40:41.019
How often I believe that?

40:41.070 --> 40:43.698
*

40:46.970 --> 40:49.530
(door opens)

40:49.580 --> 40:51.070
(door closes)

40:55.080 --> 40:56.775
HOLMES:
Oscar.

40:56.820 --> 40:58.173
Sherlock.

40:58.220 --> 40:59.642
Hey.

40:59.690 --> 41:01.658
I heard you
got sprung.

41:01.690 --> 41:03.908
Have you ever tried stopping?

41:05.630 --> 41:06.858
Stopping what?

41:06.890 --> 41:09.097
Come on, man.

41:09.130 --> 41:12.065
Rehab's for quitters.

41:12.100 --> 41:13.863
And it would be a shame,
would it not?

41:13.900 --> 41:15.492
Quitting all of this?

41:20.640 --> 41:22.779
What's that?

41:22.810 --> 41:24.129
It's contact information

41:24.180 --> 41:26.546
for Hemdale
Rehabilitation Facility.

41:28.620 --> 41:30.042
You now have a standing
reservation there.

41:30.080 --> 41:31.945
Oh, that's...

41:31.990 --> 41:33.218
that's very nice of you.

41:33.250 --> 41:35.514
No, actually, it's not.

41:35.560 --> 41:37.812
I despise you, Oscar.
I always have.

41:37.860 --> 41:39.259
You were never
more than

41:39.290 --> 41:41.258
a sickening means
to a sickening end.

41:41.290 --> 41:43.827
I would excise you
from my life entirely,

41:43.860 --> 41:47.626
but I bear
some responsibility for you.

41:47.670 --> 41:49.763
Three years ago,
you helped steer me

41:49.800 --> 41:51.768
to the lowest point
of my existence.

41:51.810 --> 41:55.132
But a case could be made that
I did the same for you, so...

41:55.180 --> 41:57.501
I came here to make amends.

41:59.750 --> 42:01.718
Hemdale, Oscar.

42:01.750 --> 42:03.672
Go there, get better...
ordonT.

42:03.720 --> 42:06.609
But mark my words,
if I do see you again,

42:06.650 --> 42:07.878
make sure it's because
you're ready

42:07.920 --> 42:09.251
to make reparations of your own.

42:12.690 --> 42:15.158
Hey.

42:15.200 --> 42:17.691
You're gonna see me again,
you can count on it.

42:17.730 --> 42:20.028
Only this time, you're gonna be
the one coming back to me.

42:20.070 --> 42:22.231
To where I am.

42:22.270 --> 42:24.090
And it won't be for any amends.
