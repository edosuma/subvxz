you're not rushing into things?

When you moved to LA to be with Nadia

07:25.361 --> 07:29.157
and you forgot to tell Nadia that
you were moving to LA to be with Nadia.

07:31.659 --> 07:33.661

07:33.744 --> 07:37.373
Uh, Veronique was technically a catfish.

07:37.457 --> 07:39.542
And things with Jessica and I
are different.

07:39.625 --> 07:44.046
I know we have a future together,
and I'm pretty sure she feels the same.

07:44.130 --> 07:45.131
That's great.

07:45.673 --> 07:48.843
All I'm saying is, when you ask her,

07:48.926 --> 07:52.388
go slow and make sure
you're on the same page.

10:58.991 --> 11:02.370
Although I realize now
I probably am off the mark there.

11:02.453 --> 11:04.455
But we're here about a lost toilet.

11:04.538 --> 11:07.041
Yeah, and the good news is,
we-- we found it

You know what, Viv?
We were just being polite.

She was just judging our relationship.

-She was reading questions off a form.
-In a fucking tone.

How antediluvian was this Nicole person,

Nothing that was said back there
wasn't completely true.

12:09.228 --> 12:12.022
-But I don't feel good about it.
-Well, whose fault is that?

12:12.857 --> 12:14.525
It's Nicole's.

12:15.151 --> 12:16.402
Am I not being clear?

12:17.945 --> 12:20.114
-[exhales] We've got to get our baby back.
-[exhales]

12:20.573 --> 12:23.868
Did you not see the lady
with the green thumb and the baseball bat?

12:24.702 --> 12:25.786
Oh, God. Duck!

12:30.541 --> 12:31.375
[engine turns over]

12:36.172 --> 12:37.256
[exhales]

12:37.339 --> 12:40.468
Goddess bless, this is our chance.

12:40.760 --> 12:42.928
We take back the night.

12:43.012 --> 12:44.847
No! No, Frankie, what are you doing?

12:44.930 --> 12:48.225
What I was born to do, steal toilets.

12:51.520 --> 12:54.565
Well, we were going to have
strawberries and cream for dessert,

12:54.648 --> 12:57.860
but I guess now
we'll just be having cream.

12:58.819 --> 13:01.280
I, for one, could not be more excited.

13:01.363 --> 13:03.824
Says the guy with the belly
full of strawberries, am I right?

13:03.908 --> 13:05.701
Ooh, sick burn, Jessica.

13:06.160 --> 13:08.162
And an interesting talking point.

13:09.246 --> 13:13.250
Explain to us one more time
how the berries ended up in your belly.

13:13.918 --> 13:17.838
As you all know, I love nothing more
than a good strawberry.

13:17.922 --> 13:20.007
Lie. You once told me

13:20.090 --> 13:22.802
-fruit doesn't count as dessert.
-It doesn't.

13:22.885 --> 13:26.597
So we're to believe
that someone so notoriously anti-berry

13:26.680 --> 13:28.641
would suddenly eat all those berries?

13:30.935 --> 13:34.271
Unless there were no berries.

13:34.772 --> 13:37.483
-I mean, I am locked in.
-Yeah.

13:37.566 --> 13:40.152
Would it be fair to say
that you have a history

13:40.236 --> 13:43.489
of eating secret fast food in your car?

13:43.572 --> 13:47.117
I have driven through some places, sure.
Who hasn't?

13:47.201 --> 13:49.370
And what place
did you drive through today?

13:49.453 --> 13:51.455
McDonald's? Taco Bell?

13:52.414 --> 13:54.875
Not Yoshinoya Beef Bowl!

13:55.376 --> 13:56.919
Excuse me. I have cream to whip.

13:57.002 --> 13:59.755
That's why you have
all those mints in your car.

14:00.422 --> 14:02.049
To hide your burger breath!

14:02.132 --> 14:04.426
Do we have to keep talking
about my eating habits

14:04.510 --> 14:07.680
when people here have
more important things to discuss?

14:11.308 --> 14:14.478
Are we the people who have
more important things to discuss?

14:15.020 --> 14:15.855
Uh...

14:15.938 --> 14:18.732
Oh, we gotta go faster. That lunatic
could come home any minute.

14:18.816 --> 14:21.527
Let her come.
I've got an unopened can of whoop-ass...

14:21.610 --> 14:24.238
-[grunts]
-...burning a hole in my pocket.

14:24.655 --> 14:26.198
[Frankie grunts, pants]

14:26.282 --> 14:28.242
-[yells]
-Oh.

14:28.325 --> 14:30.536
-[vehicle approaches]
-[grunts] Damn!

14:30.619 --> 14:33.163
-Sweet sexy Santa, it's stuck!
-[car door closes]

14:33.247 --> 14:34.874
-What are we gonna do?
-[grunts]

14:35.666 --> 14:37.835
Put your hands in the air
and step away from the toilet.

14:40.337 --> 14:42.089
[indistinct police radio chatter]

14:43.215 --> 14:47.094
You are not being singled out.
No one is allowed to keep a bird at work.

14:47.720 --> 14:51.056
Okay. Hi. Pigeon lady? Out. Time's up. Go.

14:51.140 --> 14:54.602
Oh, Brianna. I'm glad you stopped by.
I was actually going to--

14:54.685 --> 14:56.812
No, no, no. I have to talk to you.

14:57.271 --> 14:58.981
Okay. What about?

14:59.064 --> 15:02.526
Just want to make clear,
Barry and I are rock-solid.

15:02.610 --> 15:04.862
I didn't say you weren't.

15:04.945 --> 15:07.573
Mmm, yeah-huh, you kind of did.

15:07.656 --> 15:11.201
Uh, Brianna, the most important thing
to keep in mind here is

15:11.285 --> 15:13.495
I super don't care
about your relationship.

15:13.579 --> 15:18.459
Great. Then you won't mind correcting
that form and making it read "rock-solid."

15:21.003 --> 15:22.546
Yep. Sure.

15:25.549 --> 15:27.051
And done.

15:27.509 --> 15:29.261
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

15:30.346 --> 15:31.430
Great.

15:32.681 --> 15:35.017
And what was it
that you want to talk to me about?

15:35.100 --> 15:37.436
Oh, right. This.

15:38.854 --> 15:41.941
It's an offer from Taneth.

15:42.775 --> 15:44.318
For a promotion.

15:44.401 --> 15:47.821
You would still supervise Say Grace,
plus a few subsidiaries.

15:47.905 --> 15:49.615
Uh, and you get your own bathroom.

15:50.491 --> 15:53.118
Is this bathroom in San Francisco?

15:53.202 --> 15:54.203
Yes.

15:54.787 --> 15:56.246
With the job.

15:57.247 --> 15:58.248
Oh.

15:59.458 --> 16:01.961
Officers, this isn't what it looks like.

16:02.044 --> 16:03.462
You're not stealing a toilet?

16:03.545 --> 16:05.381
I guess it is what it looks like.

16:05.464 --> 16:06.757
We didn't steal it.

16:06.840 --> 16:09.259
The woman that lives over there
stole it from us.

16:09.343 --> 16:10.844
We know all about Viv.

16:12.012 --> 16:13.555
Uh, if you know Viv,

16:13.639 --> 16:17.017
you'd know that she hates it
when people touch her begonias.

16:17.101 --> 16:19.436
Yeah, we just need our property back.

16:20.187 --> 16:22.564
Are these stolen SIM cards
your property, too?

16:23.315 --> 16:25.484
-[scoffs]
-Don't resist, Grace.

16:25.567 --> 16:27.778
Don't give these brutes a reason.

16:33.784 --> 16:35.035
Okay, um...

16:35.661 --> 16:38.914
So, I just kind of wanted to check in

16:38.998 --> 16:41.250
and see where we're at.

16:42.126 --> 16:45.713
Seems like we're at a brunch with two guys
who talk a lot about strawberries.

16:46.171 --> 16:47.131
Yeah, they do.

16:47.923 --> 16:49.633
But, um... I meant...

16:50.551 --> 16:52.594
uh, where we are with the relationship.

16:52.678 --> 16:54.013
Oh.

16:54.888 --> 16:55.723
Oh!

16:56.598 --> 16:59.226
I-I just want to make sure
we're on the same page.

16:59.810 --> 17:00.894
Sure.

17:01.478 --> 17:02.771
Yes!

17:02.855 --> 17:04.898
If you want to. I'm sorry.

17:04.982 --> 17:08.027
These kind of conversations
make me really nervous.

17:08.444 --> 17:10.779
Me, too. I mean, um...

17:12.489 --> 17:13.782
Okay, how about this?

17:14.700 --> 17:15.826
I'll count to three.

17:16.827 --> 17:20.456
You say what you're looking for,
and I'll say what I'm looking for.

17:21.790 --> 17:22.750
Okay.

17:25.335 --> 17:27.755
-One, two, three. Moving in together.
-Marriage.

17:28.130 --> 17:29.798
Wait, what?

17:31.091 --> 17:33.510
Let's try that again.
I didn't understand the rules.

17:33.594 --> 17:36.096
-Yeah. Me neither.
-[clears throat] Okay.

17:37.139 --> 17:39.683
One, two, three.

17:39.767 --> 17:41.518
-Marriage.
-Moving in together.

17:41.602 --> 17:42.686
[slight chuckle]

17:43.437 --> 17:44.855
[slight chuckle]

17:45.647 --> 17:46.940
Best two out of three?

17:47.024 --> 17:48.192
Okay.

17:48.275 --> 17:50.611
If that doesn't work,
we could try four out of six.

17:51.904 --> 17:52.738
Cool.

17:52.821 --> 17:55.574
I think it's clear by now
we don't even know what SIM cards are.

17:55.657 --> 17:58.786
This is not my first tango with the fuzz.
Let me do the talking.

17:58.869 --> 18:00.245
-Yeah, but I've got--
-Shh, shh.

18:00.829 --> 18:03.373
I'm gonna lay this out for you
plain and simple.

18:03.457 --> 18:05.584
We are business ladies.

18:05.667 --> 18:10.089
We did vaginal lube, we did vibrators,
and now we do toilets.

18:10.172 --> 18:12.049
Didn't see that coming.

18:12.132 --> 18:15.469
And we're taking this little puppy here
on <i>Shark Tank.</i>

18:17.387 --> 18:19.431
Okay, we're free to go.

18:19.515 --> 18:21.433
That's what we say. And you're not.

18:21.809 --> 18:25.437
Here's the problem, ladies.
We knew these were supposed to move today.

18:25.521 --> 18:28.232
-And here you are moving them.
-No, we were moving the toilet.

18:28.315 --> 18:30.484
Oh, right, the one
you're taking on <i>Shark Tank.</i>

18:30.567 --> 18:31.485
[both] Yes!

18:31.568 --> 18:35.072
Because this is
a special toilet we invented,

18:35.155 --> 18:36.782
when she got stuck on the can

18:36.865 --> 18:39.493
and didn't want her much younger husband
to find out.

18:39.576 --> 18:41.912
-He's a billionaire.
-Uh-huh.

18:41.995 --> 18:44.164
So we knew we needed to make something

18:44.248 --> 18:46.875
to replace her pulley-system
with the statue,

18:46.959 --> 18:49.628
because it got sent
to the president of Uruguay.

18:51.130 --> 18:52.881
Here. This is how it works.

18:53.799 --> 18:55.843
[mimics the sound of gears]

19:00.931 --> 19:02.850
It works better with my dummy.

19:03.350 --> 19:05.978
Okay, Frankie, let me do the talking now.

19:06.520 --> 19:11.567
I know that everything that came out
of her mouth sounded totally insane.

19:11.650 --> 19:14.444
-Yeah.
-But in her defense, it's true.

19:14.736 --> 19:15.571
It-It is true.

19:15.654 --> 19:19.074
We got a flat tire coming back from...
from the, uh, <i>Shark Tank </i>audition.

19:19.449 --> 19:21.618
We left our prototype on the road.

19:21.910 --> 19:26.206
Viv found it and used it to...
to hide her SIM cards.

19:26.540 --> 19:28.333
-Look. Here.
-Ah-ah-ah.

19:28.834 --> 19:29.668
Whoa.

19:29.751 --> 19:31.170
Well, look in my purse.

19:31.253 --> 19:34.298
You'll-- You'll find the release forms
from <i>Shark Tank.</i>

19:34.381 --> 19:35.507
Oh, and our business card

19:35.591 --> 19:40.804
which shows that we make lubes
and vibrators and soon-to-be toilets.

19:40.888 --> 19:42.181
It checks out.

19:42.264 --> 19:44.474
I'll be damned. So you are
really going on <i>Shark Tank.</i>

19:44.558 --> 19:47.811
-Yes.
-Was I unclear before, copper?

19:47.895 --> 19:49.021
Remember?

19:50.147 --> 19:52.900
-[mimics the sound of gears]
-Oh, God.

19:52.983 --> 19:55.235
Well, when you go on <i>Shark Tank,</i>

19:55.319 --> 19:57.613
you might want to leave this one at home.

19:58.363 --> 19:59.323
[scoffs]

19:59.406 --> 20:00.532
Mm-hmm.

20:00.616 --> 20:01.700
[car door opens]

20:02.075 --> 20:04.661
-[car door closes]
-[engine turns over]

20:06.538 --> 20:07.539
Where's Jessica?

20:07.623 --> 20:11.043
Uh, she's in the ladies' room,
trying out Mom's invention.

20:11.793 --> 20:15.797
Hey, I wanted to thank you for forcing
an important discussion earlier.

20:15.881 --> 20:18.342
Sorry about that,
but your father was on the warpath.

20:18.425 --> 20:19.676
I'm still on the warpath.

20:19.760 --> 20:23.305
It's okay. It actually turned out
really well, I think.

20:23.680 --> 20:26.350
-What do you mean?
-Well, we're either moving in together

20:26.433 --> 20:29.061
or getting married,
or some combination of the two.

20:29.144 --> 20:32.481
I'm not sure in which order
or if any of it's really happening.

20:32.564 --> 20:35.067
The point is, we're on the same page.

20:35.817 --> 20:40.072
You're on the same page about
not having any idea what you're doing?

20:40.155 --> 20:42.032
-Yes.
-That's par for the course

20:42.115 --> 20:43.659
in most relationships.

20:45.869 --> 20:48.789
Well, that was fun. [chuckles]

20:48.872 --> 20:51.124
Ooh, is that Wheat Thins and cream?

20:51.208 --> 20:52.751
I'm afraid so.

20:54.044 --> 20:55.671
I'm gonna call us a Lyft.

20:55.754 --> 20:58.215
Thank you so much for brunch.
You guys are awesome.

20:58.799 --> 20:59.633
[cell phone chimes]

21:00.384 --> 21:02.219
[Jessica] Found. Great.

21:02.678 --> 21:05.180
Oh, wow, our driver is...

21:05.264 --> 21:07.724
-zero minutes away. Great.
-[message decline sound]

21:07.808 --> 21:08.725
Huh.

21:09.810 --> 21:10.852
He just canceled.

21:10.936 --> 21:15.274
-We have two old bikes in the garage.
-No, let me try. Um...

21:15.732 --> 21:17.651
All right, set pickup location.

21:17.734 --> 21:19.444
-[cell phone chimes]
-Huh.

21:19.528 --> 21:21.822
-Same guy. Zero minutes away.
-[message decline sound]

21:22.322 --> 21:25.033
You know, I think one of our neighbors
could be a Lyft driver.

21:25.117 --> 21:26.118
Mr. Purcelli.

21:26.743 --> 21:30.163
Didn't he recently buy
all those heirloom rose bushes?

21:30.247 --> 21:31.748
Where did that windfall come from?

21:31.832 --> 21:33.083
-Hmm.
-[cell phone chimes]

21:33.583 --> 21:35.794
Did somebody put something
in the microwave?

21:39.756 --> 21:43.093
Robert, are you a Lyft driver named Bob H?

21:48.932 --> 21:51.268
-[Brianna] Barry.
-Hey.

21:51.351 --> 21:54.896
I have some very exciting news.

21:54.980 --> 21:57.107
Oh, Linda gets to bring her bird to work?

21:57.190 --> 21:58.025
No.

21:58.692 --> 22:00.277
But remember how you were complaining

22:00.360 --> 22:03.947
about how you live in my house,
and you only have one shelf in the closet?

22:04.031 --> 22:06.408
I didn't mention my shelf, but, yeah.

22:06.491 --> 22:10.329
What if we were to get a new place
with two closets?

22:10.412 --> 22:13.457
Well, we actually have two closets.
You just won't let me use--

22:13.540 --> 22:15.876
Okay, fine, three closets. Whatever.

22:16.168 --> 22:19.129
Yeah, and getting a new place
together would be nice.

22:19.212 --> 22:20.255
-Right?
-Yeah.

22:20.339 --> 22:25.385
And what if it were
in beautiful San Francisco?

22:25.469 --> 22:26.970
Why San Francisco?

22:27.471 --> 22:29.514
Because you love sourdough bread.

22:29.973 --> 22:35.228
And because Trust Us offered me
a sweet new gig there, and I took it.

22:35.312 --> 22:36.605
-What?
-And don't worry,

22:36.688 --> 22:38.732
I'll hook you up with a job.
I'm going to be in charge

22:38.815 --> 22:41.276
of a lot of subsidiaries,
whatever that means.

22:41.360 --> 22:44.029
-In San Francisco.
-Mm-hmm.

22:44.821 --> 22:46.073
I can't believe you did this.

22:46.156 --> 22:47.157
I know.

22:48.033 --> 22:51.787
I mean, look at me,
I'm really thinking about our future.

22:51.870 --> 22:53.455
You mean your future.

22:57.793 --> 23:00.712
-What? No.
-Yeah, I'm not going to San Francisco.

23:01.463 --> 23:02.547
But the bread...

23:02.631 --> 23:04.925
I don't even eat bread anymore.
You won't let me.

23:05.008 --> 23:08.095
That's because when you eat bread, I want
to eat bread, and I'm not eating bread.

23:08.178 --> 23:11.431
Liz and Erin are having their baby,
and I want to be around,

23:11.515 --> 23:16.144
which you'd know if you actually
talked about our future with me.

23:17.938 --> 23:18.772
[scoffs]

23:25.195 --> 23:28.532
Robert, is there something
you'd like to say to me?

23:28.615 --> 23:30.367
I'm going to level with you.

23:30.909 --> 23:33.036
I don't think those two kids
are going to make it.

23:33.120 --> 23:35.914
I was thinking more
about your secret driving profession.

23:35.997 --> 23:37.624
Oh, that.

23:38.083 --> 23:41.002
Yeah, so, uh, what do you want to know?

23:41.086 --> 23:42.838
How about we start with everything?

23:43.922 --> 23:45.215
Okay, fine.

23:46.049 --> 23:47.968
It all started when the theater went down.

23:48.051 --> 23:52.180
Robert, I'm sorry
we couldn't give the money.

23:52.722 --> 23:55.016
I know, but I really miss it.

23:55.100 --> 23:58.895
You know, the roar of the greasepaint,
the smell of the crowd.

23:59.604 --> 24:01.523
But you know what I really miss?

24:01.898 --> 24:03.900
-The camaraderie.
-Of course.

24:03.984 --> 24:05.610
That makes perfect sense.

24:06.486 --> 24:12.409
But what doesn't make any sense
is why you're driving a car for money.

24:12.784 --> 24:14.327
You're not an actor, Sol.

24:14.870 --> 24:19.124
You don't understand that giving
an audience an experience it's never had

24:19.207 --> 24:22.836
is the same thrill as driving someone
you've never met to Sav-on.

24:23.545 --> 24:25.630
I really don't understand that.

24:25.714 --> 24:28.091
Which is why I couldn't tell you.

24:28.550 --> 24:29.593
[Sol] But...

24:34.473 --> 24:38.226
if it's excitement you want,
and camaraderie,

24:38.560 --> 24:43.064
how about we go on the honeymoon
we never got to have?

24:43.648 --> 24:44.983
Like a cruise.

24:45.692 --> 24:47.569
I'm not sure a fancy cruise--

24:47.652 --> 24:50.989
I know it's no trip with a stranger
to Sav-on.

24:51.072 --> 24:52.908
But it ticks all the boxes.

24:52.991 --> 24:55.535
Meeting new people, going new places,

24:55.619 --> 24:57.537
and if that's not thrilling enough,

24:57.621 --> 25:01.041
are you aware of the term
"midnight buffet"?

25:02.292 --> 25:04.169
It was my nickname in college.

25:04.252 --> 25:07.631
Well, dust off the elastic waist.

25:07.714 --> 25:09.049
We're going...

25:09.591 --> 25:11.927
first-class all the way.

25:12.010 --> 25:15.305
If you've got the money, spend it.

25:23.230 --> 25:26.900
-What are you doing?
-I'm throwing away the stupid capes.

25:27.776 --> 25:31.404
Okay. I'm-I'm glad we're not wearing them
on <i>Shark Tank.</i>

25:31.488 --> 25:33.448
You could still wear yours to run errands.

25:33.532 --> 25:35.784
I've already got an errand cape.

25:36.743 --> 25:38.703
And I'm not going on <i>Shark Tank.</i>

25:38.787 --> 25:40.080
Excuse me?

25:41.164 --> 25:43.959
You heard what that cop said about me.

25:44.042 --> 25:47.087
[scoffs] Since when do you listen to cops?

25:47.170 --> 25:50.507
Since they started saying
exactly what you've been worried about,

25:50.590 --> 25:52.425
that everyone out there in TV land

25:52.509 --> 25:55.971
will see us as doddering old fools
talking about a potty.

25:56.054 --> 25:58.557
I admit that I have worried about that.

25:58.640 --> 26:01.393
But it's my job in this partnership
to worry.

26:01.476 --> 26:05.438
Well, you don't have to anymore,
because we are not the joke. I am.

26:05.522 --> 26:08.191
Oh, Frankie, you're not a joke.

26:08.275 --> 26:11.152
I just don't want to be
some kind of sideshow.

26:11.486 --> 26:12.988
I'll just get in the way.

26:13.905 --> 26:15.532
You came up with this.

26:16.533 --> 26:19.786
You <i>are</i> the way.
I'm not gonna go there alone.

26:19.869 --> 26:22.414
Butch doesn't go out there
without Sundance.

26:22.497 --> 26:25.917
And the last time they went out together,
they were blown to pieces.

26:26.001 --> 26:27.252
Oh, God. Listen.

26:28.670 --> 26:31.339
Ever since you and I became you and me,

26:31.423 --> 26:33.883
we've done a lot of crazy shit,

26:33.967 --> 26:36.344
but we've always done it together.

26:37.679 --> 26:39.806
And it's turned out pretty damn well.

26:40.515 --> 26:43.560
You know?
And we always have the last laugh.

26:43.643 --> 26:47.689
'Cause one of us is a mad genius,
and the other one is really smart.

26:47.772 --> 26:49.983
I'm the mad genius, right?

26:50.066 --> 26:51.526
[chuckles] Right.

26:51.610 --> 26:54.195
So get the damn capes out of the trash,

26:54.279 --> 26:56.740
'cause we are going on <i>Shark Tank.</i>

26:56.823 --> 27:01.119
Oh, shit. That was good stuff, woman.
I have goose bumps.

27:01.411 --> 27:02.454
You know what?

27:02.954 --> 27:06.541
You are just first-rate, kid.
I'm not kidding.

27:06.625 --> 27:08.752
You're first-rate too, Frankie.

27:10.503 --> 27:12.422
Are you gonna really wear the cape?

27:12.505 --> 27:14.424
[scoffs] Fuck, no.

27:15.008 --> 27:16.593
[laughs]

27:16.676 --> 27:19.971
["(I've Got) Trouble In Mind"
by The Limiñanas plays]

28:02.722 --> 28:04.057
[woman] <i>Okay, good night!</i>
