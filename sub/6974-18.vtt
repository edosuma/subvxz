00:16.750 --> 00:19.241
So what do you think?

00:19.319 --> 00:22.152
What do l think about what?

00:22.222 --> 00:28.252
That's the Brady Bunch house. That's the
house where they shot The Brady Bunch.

00:30.663 --> 00:35.293
Are you on crack? Does that honestly
look like the Brady Bunch house to you?

00:35.368 --> 00:38.531
From inside it does. Straight up.

00:38.605 --> 00:41.005
l was there delivering a pizza last night,

00:41.074 --> 00:46.011
and the guy who lives there is trying
to crowd the door so l can't see inside.

00:46.079 --> 00:50.448
But then he drops his Crazy Bread
and bends down,

00:50.517 --> 00:54.180
and boom, l see it all -

00:54.254 --> 00:56.279
the Brady Bunch house.

00:58.958 --> 01:01.426
- l'll prove it.
- Wait.

01:03.229 --> 01:06.062
What are you doing?

01:06.132 --> 01:08.726
Blake? lt's midnight.

01:08.802 --> 01:11.464
My honor is at stake.

01:13.206 --> 01:15.902
All right, nobody's home. Let's go.

01:16.810 --> 01:18.903
Come on.

01:23.583 --> 01:25.608
lt's not even locked.

01:25.718 --> 01:28.209
You're trippin'.

01:36.896 --> 01:38.955
See?

01:39.065 --> 01:41.124
l told you.

01:49.676 --> 01:52.804
This is exactly like on the show.

01:56.916 --> 02:00.511
Look at this. That weird horse sculpture.

02:03.923 --> 02:08.360
And the vase that Peter broke. Mom always
said ''Don't play ball in the house.''

02:08.461 --> 02:10.019
Remember that one?

02:10.130 --> 02:14.328
- l don't understand this.
- Who's on crack now?

02:28.848 --> 02:30.315
Hello?

02:32.485 --> 02:36.046
Remember the episode
where Marcia broke her nose?

02:36.890 --> 02:40.155
She got hit with a football.

02:41.461 --> 02:45.625
- Screw this. l'm out of here.
- Daley, don't be a puss.

02:47.800 --> 02:49.563
Daley.

03:15.895 --> 03:17.988
Hello?

03:26.739 --> 03:28.900
Bobby?

03:29.008 --> 03:30.532
Cindy?

03:32.512 --> 03:34.912
Wait. Wait.

03:45.959 --> 03:48.553
Come on. Come on.

04:16.889 --> 04:18.447
Oh, God.

04:18.558 --> 04:20.617
Oh, my God.

05:01.634 --> 05:04.125
l'm tellin' you.

05:07.774 --> 05:10.334
No. l don't see how.

05:12.979 --> 05:16.312
How else do you explain it?

05:16.382 --> 05:20.614
The guy falls from a plane
or, l dunno, maybe a helicopter.

05:20.687 --> 05:23.622
Out the door, and then...

05:26.626 --> 05:29.117
Simple as that.

05:33.399 --> 05:39.065
And how did he wind up in a helicopter? He
was busy breaking into a house at the time.

05:39.706 --> 05:41.799
Details.

05:50.750 --> 05:53.378
What you got?

05:53.486 --> 05:55.886
Maybe nothing.

06:02.495 --> 06:05.191
- You the people from the FBl?
- Michael Daley?

06:05.264 --> 06:07.824
ls someone finally gonna arrest that freak?

06:07.900 --> 06:11.734
How about you tell us what you witnessed,
and we'll go from there?

06:11.838 --> 06:15.569
What l witnessed was freaksville.
My friend was murdered.

06:15.675 --> 06:19.372
Who'd have thought this could happen
at the Brady Bunch house?

06:19.445 --> 06:22.346
- That's not the Brady Bunch house.
- lt is.

06:22.415 --> 06:26.681
l know it doesn't look like it, but it is.
That's where they shot the show.

06:26.753 --> 06:30.052
No, they shot the show
on a sound stage in Hollywood.

06:30.123 --> 06:35.186
The house in the exteriors is a split-level
in Studio City. l took a picture of it once.

06:35.962 --> 06:40.422
l'm telling you, it's like some kind of
creepy Brady Bunch museum in there.

06:40.533 --> 06:43.297
l told the cops to search it, but they wouldn't.

06:43.403 --> 06:48.932
But whatever the hell happened to Blake,
it happened right in there.

06:57.116 --> 06:59.141
Oliver Martin?

06:59.252 --> 07:03.552
Mr Martin, l'm Agent Reyes.
This is Agent Doggett. We're with the FBl.

07:03.623 --> 07:07.115
- This is about the death across the street?
- Yes. May we come in?

07:07.226 --> 07:10.662
- l already talked to the police about this.
- Yes, sir. We know.

07:10.763 --> 07:13.823
As l told them, l didn't see or hear anything.
l wasn't home.

07:13.933 --> 07:18.063
- This guy's stonewalling. Kick the door in.
- Shut up.

07:18.671 --> 07:20.832
l'm really kinda busy.

07:20.940 --> 07:24.000
Mr Martin, just five minutes
and we'll be out of your hair.

07:24.110 --> 07:28.774
Unless you want us to get a warrant,
and then we could be here for hours.

07:33.786 --> 07:35.845
Right in here, see?

07:37.023 --> 07:39.355
What happened?

07:39.459 --> 07:42.019
This isn't what l saw.

07:42.128 --> 07:44.187
None of it.

07:45.031 --> 07:47.522
lt's all different.

07:51.170 --> 07:53.104
Where'd it all go?

07:54.807 --> 07:57.435
l'm not following.

07:58.311 --> 08:01.769
What happened to all the Brady Bunch stuff?

08:01.848 --> 08:07.343
Mr Daley was under the impression that your
house was used for filming The Brady Bunch.

08:08.454 --> 08:12.481
Well, it wasn't.

08:31.577 --> 08:34.307
l know what l saw.

08:38.851 --> 08:41.410
What are you lookin' at?

08:43.523 --> 08:46.083
l wanna check somethin' out.

08:49.428 --> 08:50.986
Aha.

08:54.567 --> 08:56.660
Hold this, please.

09:05.344 --> 09:07.835
Aha.

09:08.381 --> 09:11.248
Twice with the ''ahas.''

09:16.889 --> 09:22.691
Roof's been patched. When l was inside
l knew l smelled fresh plaster.

09:22.762 --> 09:25.458
So are you gonna fill me in?

09:25.565 --> 09:31.936
A: our eyewitness places the deceased
inside this house just prior to his demise.

09:32.038 --> 09:36.031
B: we found a fragment of roofing shingle
at the scene of the impact.

09:36.108 --> 09:40.067
lt would seem it matches the discarded piece
you now hold in your hand.

09:40.146 --> 09:46.449
C: there's a hole in the roof,
recently patched, this big around.

09:47.620 --> 09:49.884
Connect A to B to C.

09:51.624 --> 09:55.253
Much in the fashion of, say,
Daffy Duck or Wile E Coyote,

09:55.328 --> 10:00.789
the deceased shot up through the roof, flew
high in the air and landed on his buddy's car.

10:03.336 --> 10:06.737
- You're serious?
- A to B to C.

10:07.840 --> 10:12.903
l think l'm finally getting the hang of this job.

10:17.316 --> 10:20.444
Case number 14-308.

10:20.519 --> 10:26.151
Blake McCormick, a well-nourished
Caucasian male, 24 years old.

10:26.258 --> 10:29.591
l will begin with my external examination.

10:31.764 --> 10:35.256
And here is a likely place to start.

10:53.552 --> 10:54.814
Agh!

11:04.196 --> 11:06.494
Help me out here, Agent Scully.

11:06.565 --> 11:11.400
Monica thinks l'm losing my marbles.
What can you tell us about what happened?

11:11.504 --> 11:14.996
For starters, Mr McCormick was dead
before he landed on the car.

11:15.074 --> 11:18.043
His skull was pulverized
from a previous impact.

11:18.144 --> 11:22.046
And judging by the roofing material
that l found in the wound,

11:22.148 --> 11:26.585
l'd say that Agent Doggett's theory
holds water.

11:26.686 --> 11:29.849
Like l asked Agent Doggett,
how exactly can that be?

11:29.922 --> 11:32.982
- Electricity.
- How's that?

11:33.059 --> 11:38.929
Or maybe electricity is only a by-product,
l'm not really sure, but...

11:39.031 --> 11:44.663
l had an odd experience today, and it
made me think to try something unusual.

11:46.338 --> 11:52.436
l borrowed an EEG machine
and l wired Mr McCormick to it.

11:53.713 --> 11:57.547
And for the last few hours
he's been putting off a faint reading.

12:00.853 --> 12:05.256
- Are you saying he's alive?
- No. He's dead as a hammer.

12:05.357 --> 12:11.455
What l'm reading is residual electricity,
like a battery that's draining off its charge.

12:13.899 --> 12:18.302
lt's fascinating.
l've never seen anything quite like it.

12:18.404 --> 12:20.964
But what does it mean?

12:21.073 --> 12:22.734
lf Mulder were here,

12:22.808 --> 12:29.714
l'd imagine he'd talk about research linking
electromagnetic fluctuations to levitation,

12:29.782 --> 12:32.876
poltergeist activity, ghost sightings.

12:32.952 --> 12:36.388
Ghosts and poltergeists?
That's what Mulder would say?

12:37.990 --> 12:42.324
At the end of the day, l wouldn't have
any theory that was any better.

12:42.428 --> 12:44.828
And l don't now.

12:56.742 --> 12:59.302
Here's to you, buddy.

13:28.841 --> 13:33.005
Well, folks, l made
pork chops and apple sauce.

14:21.227 --> 14:23.161
What is this?

14:23.229 --> 14:25.891
What in holy freakin' hell is this?

14:26.532 --> 14:29.000
Please, leave.

14:30.269 --> 14:34.035
They were here. l saw 'em. l saw 'em all.

14:34.106 --> 14:37.837
Leave, before it's too late.

14:38.878 --> 14:41.506
l saw the Brady Bunch.

14:47.086 --> 14:50.715
Oh, my God. What are you doing?

14:50.789 --> 14:52.416
Oh, my God.

14:53.959 --> 14:55.927
Oh, my God.

14:56.729 --> 14:58.594
Aaargh!

15:14.446 --> 15:18.780
Over here, guys.
Get the body in the background.

15:18.884 --> 15:25.119
Smile. All of Southern California's
watching us scratch our heads in confusion.

15:27.126 --> 15:29.822
Let's go get some damn answers.

15:35.467 --> 15:42.134
l've said all l'm gonna say to you people.
You don't like it, go get your warrant.

15:42.241 --> 15:44.732
He called your bluff.

15:44.810 --> 15:48.268
- Maybe we can get a warrant.
- Yeah.

15:48.347 --> 15:53.751
''Judge, l wanna toss the house of a man who
makes people magically zoom into the sky.''

15:53.819 --> 15:57.653
''lt has something to do with electricity
and poltergeists and whatnot.''

15:57.756 --> 16:01.351
Yeah, that'll fly.

16:02.995 --> 16:06.624
- Doggett.
- So the owner won't talk?

16:08.200 --> 16:12.102
- Excuse me?
- Smile. You're on TV.

16:14.139 --> 16:17.438
l'm in Los Angeles, at the field office.

16:17.509 --> 16:20.444
l've called in someone
whom you'll both wanna meet.

16:21.213 --> 16:24.842
April 4, 1970. 10:36am.

16:24.950 --> 16:29.284
Present for this test are John Reits,
speaking, and Anthony Fogelman, age 8.

16:29.355 --> 16:30.947
Hello, Anthony.

16:31.023 --> 16:34.151
Are you ready to begin? Good.

16:34.226 --> 16:35.989
Now, relax.

16:36.061 --> 16:38.552
Relax and focus.

16:39.631 --> 16:45.365
Almost immediately, the EEG is registering
an increase in beta-wave activity on all leads.

16:45.471 --> 16:48.634
Theta activity is rising as well.

16:48.707 --> 16:52.040
Oh, my goodness. Oh, my goodness.

16:57.716 --> 17:00.310
Well, there you have it.

17:01.920 --> 17:07.085
My right hand to God,
all four blocks rose off of the table

17:07.159 --> 17:10.185
and spiraled halfway to the ceiling
before they fell.

17:10.262 --> 17:13.492
Too bad that wasn't on film.

17:13.565 --> 17:16.261
The understatement of a lifetime.

17:17.236 --> 17:22.502
Whatever phenomenon caused this,
l also believe that it radiated

17:22.574 --> 17:27.034
an electromagnetic field
strong enough to fog the image.

17:27.746 --> 17:32.206
Don't be polite.
Call me crazy. Everybody does.

17:33.052 --> 17:35.850
l believe you.

17:37.756 --> 17:42.591
Did you recognize that kid?
That was our suspect, Oliver Martin. Right?

17:42.694 --> 17:46.892
l went through Mulder's reference books.
Van Nuys, California, 1970.

17:46.965 --> 17:51.425
One of the best-documented cases
of what was thought to be poltergeist activity.

17:51.537 --> 17:56.634
lt focused on a young boy, Anthony
Fogelman, who has since changed his name.

17:56.742 --> 18:00.405
And Dr Reits was the parapsychologist
who investigated it.

18:00.479 --> 18:05.041
Objects flew around the house.
Rooms would grow inexplicably cold.

18:05.117 --> 18:09.554
Strange voices would be heard.
Anthony's mother was at the end of her rope.

18:09.621 --> 18:13.079
l spent six months with her and her son.

18:13.158 --> 18:17.492
- Six astonishing months.
- What did you learn?

18:17.596 --> 18:21.430
That Anthony was as bewildered
as everyone else,

18:21.500 --> 18:24.594
but that he was responsible for all of it.

18:24.670 --> 18:29.471
- He was psychokinetic.
- He was the Mozart of psychokinesis.

18:30.509 --> 18:36.778
ln your line of work, why would you fall out
of touch with the Mozart of psychokinesis?

18:39.017 --> 18:45.115
Over time, Anthony's abilities faded.

18:45.190 --> 18:50.423
The last few months l was with him, there
were no manifestations of it whatsoever.

18:50.496 --> 18:52.930
He lost his power.

18:55.000 --> 18:59.960
We're lookin' at him for two murders. What
can you give us that we can take to ajudge?

19:00.038 --> 19:02.871
Was he an angry kid? Was he violent?

19:02.975 --> 19:08.709
l can't say what he grew up to be.
l haven't spoken to him in 30 years.

19:08.814 --> 19:13.148
But the Anthony l knew
was a lonely little boy.

20:15.247 --> 20:16.839
- Bye.
- Bye.

20:31.196 --> 20:33.460
This is a message for Oliver Martin.

20:33.565 --> 20:38.195
Oliver, l believe
l knew you years ago as Anthony.

20:38.270 --> 20:41.569
This is Dr John Reits calling. Remember me?

20:41.640 --> 20:47.203
lt's been far too long,
and l'd love to talk to you.

20:47.279 --> 20:50.612
l'd really like to catch up.

20:50.716 --> 20:54.777
Obviously, you're all grown-up now.

20:54.886 --> 20:58.083
lt's funny. l have trouble picturing that.

20:58.156 --> 21:01.284
My God, how time flies.

21:01.393 --> 21:06.160
But anyway,
you can reach me anytime on my cellphone.

21:06.265 --> 21:10.429
714-555-0146.

21:10.502 --> 21:14.461
l look forward to hearing from you. Bye now.

21:29.921 --> 21:33.015
- l guess he's not home.
- He's home.

21:33.125 --> 21:35.184
Aha.

21:39.131 --> 21:43.659
l was wondering why a man with
no criminal record would change his name.

21:43.769 --> 21:48.536
And then l thought about the name itself -
Oliver Martin. lt sounded familiar, so l ran it.

21:48.640 --> 21:50.938
Through what? NClC?

21:51.009 --> 21:53.807
No. A Brady Bunch website.

21:55.147 --> 21:57.775
lt popped right up.

22:00.719 --> 22:02.619
''Cousin Oliver?''

22:04.656 --> 22:07.489
- Who the hell's that?
- Carol Brady's nephew.

22:07.559 --> 22:10.528
He lived with the Bradys
during the last season of the show.

22:10.629 --> 22:15.566
You're speaking Greek to me here. What's
this case have to do with an old TV show?

22:15.667 --> 22:19.194
You remember what Daley
claimed he saw inside that house.

22:19.304 --> 22:23.035
He said it was the Brady Bunch house.
He seemed certain of it.

22:23.141 --> 22:28.374
And now this name - Oliver Martin.
Just connecting A to B to C.

22:32.150 --> 22:34.880
ls this makin' any sense to you?

22:34.986 --> 22:38.046
When you knew Anthony,
was he nutty for The Brady Bunch?

22:38.924 --> 22:41.722
No. We'd watch it together.

22:43.228 --> 22:46.527
Say he is. What's it mean?

22:46.598 --> 22:49.396
Why name himself after Cousin Oliver?

22:49.501 --> 22:53.528
None of the other Bradys liked Oliver,
he was a self-described pest.

22:53.605 --> 22:55.596
The jinx.

22:55.707 --> 22:57.834
Cousin Oliver, the jinx.

23:00.879 --> 23:04.042
So maybe l watched an episode or two.

23:04.116 --> 23:10.419
So what you're saying is that his choice
speaks to Anthony Fogelman's character?

23:10.522 --> 23:16.358
How he views himself -
unlucky, star-crossed, a danger.

23:17.028 --> 23:22.227
So be it. Just tell me how this
helps me bust him and l'm happy.

23:22.300 --> 23:25.963
l'm starting to hope that
it doesn't come to that.

23:26.071 --> 23:27.971
What do you mean?

23:28.073 --> 23:34.740
The power this man seemingly possesses
is extraordinary. lt needs to be studied.

23:34.813 --> 23:39.876
lt could expand the scope of human
knowledge. lt could change everything.

23:39.951 --> 23:42.249
lt very well could.

23:42.320 --> 23:45.721
l've been working this unit
for nine years now.

23:45.791 --> 23:49.283
l've investigated nearly 200 paranormal cases.

23:50.629 --> 23:56.499
We are due for some incontrovertible proof.
l want vindication.

23:56.601 --> 24:01.470
For Mulder, and for all of us.

24:28.500 --> 24:31.333
What in the hell?

24:38.276 --> 24:40.335
What is it?

24:41.680 --> 24:44.274
Agent Doggett? What?

24:51.990 --> 24:54.049
Wait here.

25:11.343 --> 25:14.005
Oliver Martin? FBl.

25:28.827 --> 25:32.820
- Get out of my house.
- Oliver.

25:32.898 --> 25:36.857
There's someone here that
wants to talk to you. Dr Reits.

25:36.935 --> 25:39.597
Do you remember him?

25:39.704 --> 25:44.403
Why won't you people just leave me alone?
Please, get out.

25:49.514 --> 25:51.209
Agh. No.

26:28.320 --> 26:30.413
Oh, crap.

26:41.733 --> 26:43.928
Oliver?

26:44.002 --> 26:45.799
Dr Reits?

26:45.904 --> 26:47.997
l could use some help up here.

26:54.179 --> 26:56.511
Oliver?

26:56.615 --> 26:58.674
You up there?

26:58.783 --> 27:01.911
ls it down there? Whatever the hell.

27:07.692 --> 27:09.785
Oliver. Oliver.

27:20.171 --> 27:22.332
- Anthony?
- Hey.

27:22.440 --> 27:24.340
l'm up here.

27:24.442 --> 27:27.172
Dr Reits, help me out here.

27:29.047 --> 27:30.139
Anthony?

27:30.215 --> 27:33.616
Come back here. He's dangerous.

27:33.685 --> 27:35.550
Anthony?

27:40.659 --> 27:43.457
Anthony,

27:43.528 --> 27:46.224
let him go.

27:46.331 --> 27:48.231
l can't.

27:48.333 --> 27:50.392
Sure you can.

27:51.636 --> 27:53.501
No.

27:55.707 --> 27:58.574
- l don't know how.
- Anthony,

27:59.210 --> 28:03.806
you're a good person.
l know that hasn't changed.

28:05.817 --> 28:09.981
Relax and focus, remember?

28:12.023 --> 28:13.388
Good.

28:13.491 --> 28:17.052
Relax and focus.

28:46.725 --> 28:50.024
Oh, my God.

28:50.095 --> 28:51.722
This is...

28:51.796 --> 28:55.391
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

28:57.102 --> 28:59.434
Just minor bruising.

28:59.904 --> 29:03.362
Dana Scully, meet Oliver Martin.

29:05.276 --> 29:07.710
Anthony Fogelman.

29:12.050 --> 29:14.211
- Oliver.
- Oliver.

29:14.285 --> 29:19.086
- lt's a great pleasure to meet you.
- Where did all this come from, Oliver?

29:19.157 --> 29:22.092
How did you make this come to be?

29:24.462 --> 29:27.056
l think about it,

29:27.132 --> 29:29.225
and it's here.

29:29.300 --> 29:32.633
Can you think about other things?

29:38.076 --> 29:44.413
What happens if you think
about another place? A nice place?

29:45.517 --> 29:49.476
Can you do that, Oliver? Please?

29:50.755 --> 29:53.690
lt's important to me.

30:09.507 --> 30:11.600
Oh, my God.

30:37.368 --> 30:41.395
Mainly, l like to be here.

30:48.012 --> 30:50.640
Oliver,

30:50.715 --> 30:54.481
with your help we could learn so much.

30:56.855 --> 31:00.018
l would love to take you
back with us to Washington.

31:03.261 --> 31:07.061
lt would mean so much to me, Oliver,

31:07.165 --> 31:10.066
to show the whole world.

31:17.375 --> 31:19.343
Wonderful.

31:19.410 --> 31:22.004
Let's go get you packed.

31:30.088 --> 31:34.582
- We've got a tiger by the tail.
- Do you believe he intended to kill you?

31:34.692 --> 31:38.924
He wanted me out of his house, and the way
l went was involuntary, like a sneeze.

31:39.030 --> 31:42.397
lt means he's not in control
of this power of his.

31:42.467 --> 31:44.958
l think that's where we can help him.

31:45.069 --> 31:48.436
He needs to learn how to control his powers.

31:48.539 --> 31:52.805
My God, there's no end to
what he could accomplish.

31:52.911 --> 31:55.539
Or to the harm he could do
if he goes off the deep end,

31:55.613 --> 31:59.071
which isn't a long walk for this guy,
in case you haven't noticed.

31:59.150 --> 32:03.644
This whole Brady Bunch thing?
l'm not so sure about this.

32:03.755 --> 32:09.159
We can't keep him here. Two people are dead.
Clearly this isn't working.

32:09.260 --> 32:12.127
And besides, l mean,

32:12.230 --> 32:17.759
as grand as this may sound,
we owe it to the world.

32:17.835 --> 32:23.068
Maybe, except that l can't shake this feeling
that the other shoe's gonna drop.

32:23.141 --> 32:26.838
That there's something Oliver's not telling us.

32:34.185 --> 32:36.312
Oliver? Coming?

32:41.826 --> 32:43.691
Oliver?

33:45.823 --> 33:47.654
Wow.

33:51.529 --> 33:53.929
May l have a glass of water?

33:57.201 --> 34:02.195
We'll only be a minute.
Anything you need, just ask Arlene.

34:23.393 --> 34:27.956
- So what do you think, Dr Jaycocks?
- What do l think?

34:28.065 --> 34:32.435
l think there's a hell of a lot of physics books
that are due for major rewrites.

34:32.536 --> 34:38.476
And l think a year from now you and Dr Reits
will be in Stockholm accepting a Nobel prize.

34:40.277 --> 34:42.940
This will change everything.

34:44.715 --> 34:47.616
- May l use your phone?
- Yeah.

34:49.987 --> 34:53.081
So you're on board with this?

34:54.592 --> 34:58.289
- What happens next?
- l want Kersh to see this.

34:58.396 --> 35:03.959
l want the director himself in here. Do you
realize what this means? This kind of proof?

35:04.068 --> 35:09.335
lt ensures that they can't shut you down.
lt means the X-Files will go on forever.

35:15.646 --> 35:17.443
Agent Scully.

35:20.351 --> 35:27.086
- He's having a seizure. What happened?
- l saw a big spark, then he just collapsed.

35:27.158 --> 35:33.654
We need an ambulance. We got a man having
a seizure. AD Skinner's office. Make it quick.

35:40.138 --> 35:46.008
lt was just all the excitement.
A little bed rest will do him wonders.

35:46.110 --> 35:49.637
And we'll get things right back on schedule.

36:05.730 --> 36:09.996
- What do his doctors say?
- His electrolytes were severely imbalanced.

36:10.067 --> 36:13.366
That sent him into shock.
They've stabilized his fluids.

36:13.471 --> 36:16.338
- When will they release him?
- There are problems.

36:16.407 --> 36:19.740
His thyroid level is elevated.
His glucose is low.

36:19.844 --> 36:23.177
CPK, liver enzymes and BUN,
they're all elevated.

36:23.247 --> 36:28.844
- Which in a nutshell means...?
- lt points to a multi-system organ failure.

36:28.920 --> 36:31.889
Gradually his body is consuming itself.

36:31.989 --> 36:36.983
lt's been going on for months,
and maybe even years.

36:38.696 --> 36:40.664
What's causing it?

36:40.731 --> 36:44.258
His doctors have no idea,
but l think l'm starting to.

36:44.368 --> 36:48.099
This power of his, it's eating him alive.

36:48.206 --> 36:54.236
And if so, it follows that the more he uses it
the more his health will decline.

36:55.279 --> 36:57.270
Until finally...

36:59.183 --> 37:01.674
What in the hell?

37:05.890 --> 37:07.949
My God.

37:21.272 --> 37:23.706
Oliver?

37:25.209 --> 37:29.578
Oliver, those people just now, was that...?

37:30.114 --> 37:33.049
Were they...?

37:33.117 --> 37:35.551
Why were they here?

37:38.055 --> 37:40.387
To say goodbye.

37:40.458 --> 37:42.551
Why goodbye, Oliver?

37:47.898 --> 37:50.662
Because l'm dying.

38:06.517 --> 38:09.816
April 4, 1970. 10:36am.

38:09.920 --> 38:14.584
Present for this test are John Reits,
speaking, and Anthony Fogelman, age 8.

38:14.659 --> 38:16.183
Hello, Anthony.

38:16.294 --> 38:18.091
Are you ready to begin?

38:19.297 --> 38:24.599
- Any change in his condition?
- They're trying everything they can think of.

38:24.669 --> 38:27.763
Experimental drugs, plasma transfusion.

38:27.838 --> 38:31.740
- None of that's gonna work.
- Why not?

38:31.809 --> 38:35.301
Because they're treatin' the symptoms,
not the cause.

38:35.379 --> 38:38.906
- What do you have, John?
- One big question.

38:40.718 --> 38:43.619
Why The Brady Bunch?

38:43.688 --> 38:48.318
Seriously. You two are fans. Why are people
still watching a 30-year-old TV show?

38:48.392 --> 38:52.988
Because they're the family
everyone wishes they had.

38:53.064 --> 38:57.467
Loving parents, lots of brothers and sisters,
everybody getting along.

38:57.535 --> 39:04.270
They're the perfect family, and since Oliver
didn't have one as a child, he created one.

39:04.342 --> 39:09.336
Sure, l'd buy all that.
But in this case, why The Brady Bunch?

39:09.413 --> 39:13.782
Why not The Partridge Family?
Why not Eight ls Enough?

39:18.322 --> 39:23.055
Where was Oliver when he first saw
The Brady Bunch? He was with you, right?

39:23.160 --> 39:27.494
He'd always insist that we watch it together,
every week l was there.

39:27.565 --> 39:30.932
The longer you two were together,
the more his power faded,

39:31.035 --> 39:34.266
until finally it went away completely.

39:34.772 --> 39:37.570
Why do you think that was?

39:49.387 --> 39:53.084
Because for the first time in his life,

39:54.191 --> 39:56.022
he was happy.

39:56.093 --> 39:58.755
Because he was with you.

40:00.631 --> 40:04.761
What are you suggesting
is the course of action, John?

40:04.869 --> 40:10.569
A: Oliver's gonna die
if he continues to use his power.

40:11.742 --> 40:16.076
B: his power goes away when he's happy.

40:16.747 --> 40:21.081
And C: you're the father he never had
and he loves you.

40:24.622 --> 40:26.817
A to B to C.

40:41.472 --> 40:46.671
Come on, Oliver.
You gotta eat something. Doctor's orders.

40:54.151 --> 40:56.642
Talk to him, will you?

41:04.995 --> 41:07.156
Oliver?

41:10.768 --> 41:13.362
You have to understand -

41:13.471 --> 41:16.998
my life's work,

41:17.107 --> 41:22.807
the vindication of it,
it's so important to me.

41:24.148 --> 41:27.515
l let it blind me.

41:27.618 --> 41:32.521
l treated you like a lab rat,
and not a man.

41:34.225 --> 41:36.557
And 30 years ago,

41:37.695 --> 41:41.222
l left with barely a goodbye.

41:43.801 --> 41:46.361
l am sorry for that.

41:49.073 --> 41:53.476
You can't use your power. Not ever again.

41:55.713 --> 41:58.682
l forbid it.

41:58.749 --> 42:01.684
l can't be alone.

42:04.088 --> 42:06.386
You won't be.

42:07.424 --> 42:09.722
You've got me.

42:10.995 --> 42:13.486
Can you forgive me, Oliver?

42:17.668 --> 42:19.499
Anthony.

42:43.060 --> 42:45.460
So close, Dana.

42:45.563 --> 42:48.691
l'm sorry you don't get your proof.

42:50.768 --> 42:52.861
Me too.

42:55.906 --> 42:59.307
Maybe l've had it these past nine years.

43:02.746 --> 43:09.618
lf not proof of the paranormal,
then of more important things.

43:24.401 --> 43:29.668
Here's hoping the TV stays off
and he learns how to love the real world.

43:41.652 --> 43:45.645
l think you are getting the hang of this job.
