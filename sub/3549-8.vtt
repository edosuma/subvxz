YOU'RE HAVING SEX
WITH YOUR BEST FRIEND'S MOTHER?

00:06.006 --> 00:09.180
AN AFFAIR WAS REVEALED.
 YOU HAVE TO PROMISE ME

00:09.180 --> 00:11.612
THAT YOU WON'T SAY ANYTHING
TO HER PSYCHO HUSBAND.

00:11.612 --> 00:14.014
A GOOD TIME WAS BROUGHT
TO AN END.
 BACK OFF!

00:14.014 --> 00:17.048
WHO DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE TALKING TO?
 WE'RE DONE HERE. GOOD-BYE.

00:17.048 --> 00:20.651
AND A MAN'S PAST
WAS UNCOVERED.
 LOOK, WE'RE JUST TRYING
TO GET SOME INFO ON THIS GUY.

00:20.651 --> 00:24.195
HE JUST MOVED TO FAIRVIEW,

00:24.195 --> 00:26.157
AND HE'S REALLY CREEPING
PEOPLE OUT.
 YOU'RE IN FAIRVIEW?

00:26.157 --> 00:28.129
YEAH, WHY? DOES THAT
MEAN SOMETHING TO YA?

00:34.665 --> 00:36.667

00:36.667 --> 00:38.669
THE OWNER
OF THE WHITE HORSE BAR

00:38.669 --> 00:43.674

01:03.063 --> 01:05.065
THIS YEAR,
THOSE YOUNG MUSICIANS

01:05.065 --> 01:09.069
WERE JOINED BY A GROUP
OF MIDDLE-AGED MEN

01:09.069 --> 01:12.103
WHO CAME
WITH THEIR STIFF JOINTS...

01:12.103 --> 01:15.146

IS SHE CRAZY
OR JUST DESPERATELY LONELY?

05:40.971 --> 05:43.974

 ALL SHE WANTS
IS SOME HUMAN CONTACT--

05:43.974 --> 05:46.477
TO HANG OUT WITH US
ON THE OCCASIONAL WEEKEND,

05:46.477 --> 05:48.979
MAYBE A HOLIDAY OR TWO.

06:51.912 --> 06:53.884

IS SANDRA BIRCH.

06:53.884 --> 06:56.887

 SHE ISN'T.

06:56.887 --> 07:00.050
I WENT ONLINE AND PULLED
A BUNCH OF HER ARTICLES,

07:00.050 --> 07:03.053
AND A LOT OF THEM
ARE COMPLETE HATCHET JOBS.
 "A DEEPER LOOK SUGGESTS
SOMETHING DARKER,

TANKS YOU,

A WAY TO HANDLE THIS.

07:48.038 --> 07:50.941
YOU'RE GONNA TAKE IT AWAY
FROM ME?

07:50.941 --> 07:54.505
PORTER GOT ANNE SCHILLING
PREGNANT.

07:56.947 --> 07:59.049

TALK TO HIM?

08:19.600 --> 08:22.132
NO, I HAVE TO TALK
TO SOMEONE ELSE FIRST.

10:39.970 --> 10:41.641
SO, SUSAN, I'M...

10:41.641 --> 10:43.343
I'M SENSING THAT, UH,

10:43.343 --> 10:46.046
YOU'RE A LITTLE FREAKED OUT
ABOUT MY AGE.

10:46.046 --> 10:49.049
(chuckles) YOU KNOW, WHEN YOUR
24-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER CALLS YOU

10:49.049 --> 10:52.052
AND TELLS YOU SHE'S BRINGING
HOME A BOY FROM COLLEGE,

10:52.052 --> 10:54.424
YOU SORT OF EXPECT IT
TO BE, WELL...

10:54.424 --> 10:56.126
A BOY.

10:56.126 --> 10:57.728
(chuckles)

10:57.728 --> 11:00.791
WELL, I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW
THAT WE DIDN'T START DATING

11:00.791 --> 11:02.793
UNTIL AFTER THE SEMESTER
WAS OVER.

11:02.793 --> 11:05.736
I DON'T DATE STUDENTS.
THAT'S--THAT'S A RULE WITH ME.

11:05.736 --> 11:08.138
AND A DAMN GOOD ONE.

11:08.138 --> 11:10.370
ALTHOUGH STRICTLY SPEAKING,

11:10.370 --> 11:13.103
I SUPPOSE MY THIRD WIFE
 WAS MY TEACHING ASSISTANT,

11:13.103 --> 11:17.207
BUT SHE WAS REALLY MORE
OF MY EMPLOYEE THAN MY STUDENT.
 YOUR WHAT?

11:17.207 --> 11:19.209
STUDENT.

11:19.209 --> 11:21.011
BEFORE THAT.
 EMPLOYEE.

11:21.011 --> 11:23.253
BEFORE THAT.
 THIRD WIFE.

11:23.253 --> 11:26.116
THAT'S THE ONE.

11:26.116 --> 11:29.189
SO YOU'VE BEEN MARRIED
THREE TIMES?

11:29.189 --> 11:32.192
DIDN'T JULIE TELL YOU THAT?
 I DON'T BELIEVE SO.

11:32.192 --> 11:35.695
ALTHOUGH I MAY HAVE BLACKED OUT
AFTER SHE TOLD ME YOU WERE 40.

11:35.695 --> 11:38.368
SO HOW DOES A MAN YOUR AGE

11:38.368 --> 11:40.771
GET MARRIED AND DIVORCED
THREE TIMES?

11:40.771 --> 11:43.734
WELL, MY FIRST WIFE AND I
WERE ONLY MARRIED A FEW MONTHS,

11:43.734 --> 11:47.137
SO I-I ALMOST
DON'T LIKE TO COUNT IT.
 DID SOMEONE THROW RICE AT YOU?

11:47.137 --> 11:49.079
YEAH.
 IT COUNTS.

11:49.079 --> 11:51.782
IS THIS UPSETTING YOU?
I-I THOUGHT YOU'D UNDERSTAND.

11:51.782 --> 11:54.114
JULIE SAID
YOU'D BEEN DIVORCED YOURSELF.

11:54.114 --> 11:55.415
YEAH. ONLY TWICE.

11:55.415 --> 11:58.789
TWO. SMALL NUMBER.
MUCH SMALLER THAN THREE.

11:58.789 --> 12:01.852
AND MY FIRST CHEATED ON ME,
SO THAT DOESN'T EVEN COUNT.

12:01.852 --> 12:04.054
DID SOMEONE THROW RICE
AT YOU?
 SHUT UP.

12:04.054 --> 12:06.056
LOOK, YOU AND I BOTH KNOW

12:06.056 --> 12:08.799
THAT SOMETIMES
IT JUST DOESN'T WORK OUT.

12:08.799 --> 12:11.101
WELL...

12:11.101 --> 12:12.502
THAT'S TRUE.

12:12.502 --> 12:16.236
AND BESIDES, IT--IT'S DIFFERENT
WITH JULIE. I LOVE HER SO MUCH.

12:16.236 --> 12:18.238
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT
THAT YOU KNOW

12:18.238 --> 12:20.240
I TAKE MY COMMITMENTS
SERIOUSLY.

12:20.240 --> 12:22.272
WHY?

12:24.344 --> 12:26.216
OH, MY GOD.

12:26.216 --> 12:27.878
(Julie) LLOYD, COME HERE.

12:27.878 --> 12:30.080
I CAN'T FIND
MY CELL PHONE CHARGER.

12:30.080 --> 12:33.423
PLEASE, PLEASE,
DON'T SAY ANYTHING.

12:33.423 --> 12:35.826
I WANT IT TO BE A SURPRISE.
THANKS...

12:35.826 --> 12:36.957
MOM.

12:42.232 --> 12:44.534
AND THIS IS
MY OWN LITTLE KITCHEN.

12:44.534 --> 12:47.237
I'M PRETTY SURE
MY HUSBAND'S HERE SOMEWHERE.

12:47.237 --> 12:49.239
ORSON, DEAR,
ARE YOU DECENT?

12:49.239 --> 12:51.071
(Orson) IN HERE, LOVE.

12:57.207 --> 12:59.149
NICE TO MEET YOU.

12:59.149 --> 13:02.412
I'VE HAD THE MOST DELIGHTFUL
TIME WITH YOUR WIFE AND STEPSON.

13:02.412 --> 13:05.085
OH.
 (chuckles)

13:05.085 --> 13:07.187
YOUR HOME IS STUNNING.

13:07.187 --> 13:10.921
YOU CANNOT RUN A BUSINESS
AND DO ALL THIS, TOO.

13:10.921 --> 13:12.923
TELL ME YOU HAVE
A HOUSEKEEPER.

13:12.923 --> 13:16.096
WHY WOULD I PAY SOMEONE TO
DO WORK THAT GIVES ME SUCH JOY?

13:16.096 --> 13:18.368
NOW WHO WANTS
A LITTLE SNACK?

13:18.368 --> 13:19.900
(whispers) OH.

13:19.900 --> 13:22.432
BREE, THE IDEA WAS

13:22.432 --> 13:25.435
FOR ME TO SPEND
A TYPICAL DAY WITH YOU.

13:25.435 --> 13:26.506
MM.

13:26.506 --> 13:29.039
SO THIS IS LEGIT?

13:29.039 --> 13:32.112
YOU'RE REALLY THIS DONNA REED
HOUSEWIFE FROM THE '50s?

13:32.112 --> 13:34.084
YOU SAY THAT
LIKE IT'S A BAD THING.

13:34.084 --> 13:37.087
I THINK THAT DECADE
HAD A LOT TO RECOMMEND IT.

13:37.087 --> 13:39.389
MM,
PEOPLE HAD VALUES THEN--

13:39.389 --> 13:41.551
VALUES THIS FAMILY
STRIVES TO UPHOLD.

13:41.551 --> 13:43.553
BUT NOT EVERYONE

13:43.553 --> 13:46.256
CAN KEEP A PERFECT HOUSE
FOR A PERFECT FAMILY

13:46.256 --> 13:48.899
WITH PERFECT FOOD
AND PERFECT FLOWERS.

13:48.899 --> 13:50.861
OF COURSE THEY CAN...

13:50.861 --> 13:53.363
IF THEY READ MY BOOK, THAT IS.
 MM.

13:53.363 --> 13:56.436
OKAY, TRUTH BE TOLD...
(sighs)

13:56.436 --> 13:58.108
I'M FAR FROM PERFECT.

13:58.108 --> 14:03.143
ONLY YESTERDAY, I BURNED
A WHOLE TRAY OF BISCOTTI.

14:03.143 --> 14:04.444
WOW. (chuckles)

14:04.444 --> 14:07.978
AND TO THINK, I WAS WORRIED
ABOUT FINDING A LEAD.

14:07.978 --> 14:10.020
(telephone rings)

14:10.020 --> 14:11.851
ANDREW, PLEASE.
THE MACHINE CAN GET IT.

14:11.851 --> 14:14.154
(ring)
 WE NEVER ANSWER THE PHONE
WHILE ENTERTAINING.

14:14.154 --> 14:16.156
SO RUDE TO ONE'S GUESTS.
 MM.

14:16.156 --> 14:19.159
NOW, UM, MAY I POUR YOU
SOME MORE TEA?
 (ring)

14:19.159 --> 14:22.963
(beep)
 (man) This is Mr. Jones
for Orson Hodge.

14:22.963 --> 14:24.264
Due to vacation schedules,

14:24.264 --> 14:26.967
I'll be filling in
for your parole officer.

14:26.967 --> 14:28.969
Give me a call, please.
 (beep)

14:31.301 --> 14:33.003
SO, MR. HODGE...

14:33.003 --> 14:35.275
(pen clicks loudly)

14:35.275 --> 14:37.407
YOU'VE BEEN TO PRISON.

14:38.608 --> 14:40.610
NOW CAN I BE GAY?

14:40.610 --> 14:42.152
HUH.

14:44.614 --> 14:46.957
(door opens and closes)

14:46.957 --> 14:48.888
KIRBY, IS THAT YOU?

14:48.888 --> 14:51.361
I THOUGHT
YOU WENT TO THE MOVIES.

14:55.465 --> 14:58.528
ARE YOU REALLY PREGNANT?

15:04.174 --> 15:05.675
YES.

15:08.678 --> 15:11.581
A COUPLE OF MONTHS BACK,

15:11.581 --> 15:13.913
WARREN AND I...

15:13.913 --> 15:15.915
W-WE FOUGHT.

15:18.248 --> 15:21.151
I WAS PRETTY BANGED UP,
AND--AND...

15:21.151 --> 15:24.194
PORTER CAME BY
LOOKING FOR KIRBY,

15:24.194 --> 15:25.495
AND--AND...

15:27.297 --> 15:29.299
HE WAS SO...

15:29.299 --> 15:32.932
KIND AND... AND GENTLE.

15:32.932 --> 15:34.934
DON'T.

15:34.934 --> 15:39.169
DON'T TRY AND JUSTIFY THIS.
THIS IS SICK.

15:39.169 --> 15:41.972
YOU ARE SICK.

15:43.713 --> 15:46.516
(sniffles)

15:46.516 --> 15:49.179
YOUR SON...

15:49.179 --> 15:52.152
LOVES ME.

15:52.152 --> 15:54.154
AND--AND I LOVE HIM.

15:56.186 --> 15:59.359
AND--AND--AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

15:59.359 --> 16:03.963
I'M GLAD
I'M HAVING PORTER'S BABY.

16:03.963 --> 16:05.965
(sighs)

16:07.567 --> 16:09.099
DAMN.

16:11.341 --> 16:14.204
NOT EXACTLY WHAT A HUSBAND WANTS
TO HEAR COMING IN THE DOOR.

16:16.176 --> 16:19.109
I SUPPOSE
DINNER'S NOT READY, EITHER.

16:21.381 --> 16:24.254
WARREN, I'M SORRY THAT--

16:24.254 --> 16:25.555
THANK YOU.

16:27.417 --> 16:30.120
I'M GONNA HAVE
TO ASK YOU TO LEAVE.

16:31.761 --> 16:33.493
(whispers) DON'T GO.

16:33.493 --> 16:37.197
I NEED TO TALK
WITH MY WIFE RIGHT NOW.

16:37.197 --> 16:39.199
I'M SORRY FOR ANY PAIN

16:39.199 --> 16:42.132
THIS HAS CAUSED YOUR FAMILY,
MRS. SCAVO.

16:42.132 --> 16:44.434
(mouths word)

16:48.478 --> 16:49.709
(door closes)

16:49.709 --> 16:53.213
(keys jingling)

17:00.090 --> 17:01.651
DAMN IT.

17:03.593 --> 17:07.797
YOU THINK YOU CAN HUMILIATE ME?!
YOU PIECE OF FILTH!
 (Anne) AAH!

17:07.797 --> 17:10.599
GET OFF OF HER! GET OFF OF HER!
I'M CALLING THE POLICE!

17:10.599 --> 17:12.662
STAY OUT OF THIS! (grunts)
 AAH!

17:15.734 --> 17:17.707
(Lynette grunts)
 (grunts)

17:19.769 --> 17:24.273
OKAY, WELL, JUST SO YOU KNOW,
I HIT BACK.

17:24.273 --> 17:27.117
CALL THE POLICE.

17:27.117 --> 17:31.651
I'D LOVE TO HEAR HER EXPLAIN
HER WAY OUT OF STATUTORY RAPE.

17:31.651 --> 17:34.184
YOU DON'T LIVE HERE ANYMORE.

17:43.733 --> 17:48.568
(gasps) OH, MY GOD!
OH, MY GOD!

17:48.568 --> 17:50.270
(gasps)

17:50.270 --> 17:54.504
THANK YOU FOR COMING BACK.
(sniffles)

17:54.504 --> 17:56.376
(sighs)

18:04.454 --> 18:07.157
HERE WE ARE, BOYS!
ARE YOU PSYCHED OR WHAT?

18:07.157 --> 18:09.319
OH, I FEEL LIKE
I'M GONNA PUKE AGAIN.

18:09.319 --> 18:11.261
(Tom) HEY.

18:11.261 --> 18:12.692
HEY.

18:12.692 --> 18:14.794
YOU GUYS COLD SPLASH?

18:14.794 --> 18:16.196
YES, SIR.

18:16.196 --> 18:18.168
"SIR"?

18:18.168 --> 18:21.231
WE'RE BLUE ODYSSEY.
 YEAH, I CAN SEE THAT.

18:23.433 --> 18:25.435
UH, SO AFTER THE GIG,

18:25.435 --> 18:28.178
WE'RE HAVING A PARTY
AT OUR MANAGER'S LOFT.

18:28.178 --> 18:30.180
YOU GUYS SHOULD COME.
 ABSO-TIVELY.

18:30.180 --> 18:32.642
WE JUST GOTTA
CHECK WITH OUR WIVES.

18:37.487 --> 18:40.490
(indistinct conversation)

18:42.792 --> 18:45.755
(all speaking inaudibly)

18:51.731 --> 18:53.863
WHY WERE YOU
TALKING TO THAT WOMAN?

18:53.863 --> 18:56.236
SHE JUST WALKED UP
AND ASKED IF WE KNEW YOU,

18:56.236 --> 18:58.238
WANTED US TO CONFIRM
A BUNCH OF RUMORS.

18:58.238 --> 18:59.739
(chuckle nervously)
WHAT KIND OF RUMORS?

18:59.739 --> 19:02.312
JUST... STUFF SHE'D HEARD
AROUND THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

19:02.312 --> 19:04.474
WERE YOU REALLY
A BOOZEHOUND?

19:04.474 --> 19:08.248
LEE...
 NO, I'M JUST SAYING, I WISH
I'D HAVE KNOWN YOU THEN.

19:08.248 --> 19:11.381
WE'D HAVE BEEN
SUCH GOOD FRIENDS.
 SHE SEEMED TO KNOW
AN AWFUL LOT ABOUT YOU.

19:11.381 --> 19:12.682
KEY WORD--"AWFUL."

19:12.682 --> 19:16.226
I CANNOT LET THIS HAPPEN.
I HAVE TO FIND HER.

19:16.226 --> 19:18.728
WELL, SHE'S GONNA BE AT
THE BATTLE OF THE BANDS TONIGHT.

19:18.728 --> 19:21.631
WHY?
 SHE WANTS TO HEAR ORSON,
AND I QUOTE,

19:21.631 --> 19:24.534
"SING HARMONY
WITH THE GUY HE TRIED TO KILL."

19:24.534 --> 19:27.237
OH, DEAR GOD.
THIS WOMAN IS DETERMINED

19:27.237 --> 19:30.640
TO MAKE MY LIFE SOUND TEN TIMES
WORSE THAN IT ACTUALLY IS.

19:30.640 --> 19:34.674
YEAH. SO WAS YOUR FIRST HUSBAND
REALLY INTO S AND M HOOKERS?

19:37.176 --> 19:41.180
AND YOU WONDER WHY
WE'RE NEVER INVITED ANYWHERE.

19:42.752 --> 19:45.255
OKAY, GIRLS,
MOMMY'S LEAVING.

19:45.255 --> 19:46.716
I LOVE YOU!

19:46.716 --> 19:49.419
I'M PLANNING ON HAVING
A MASSIVE HANGOVER TOMORROW,

19:49.419 --> 19:52.522
SO KEEP THE GIRLS UP LATE
SO WE CAN ALL SLEEP IN.

19:59.198 --> 20:02.402
MY, DON'T YOU LOOK FESTIVE.

20:02.402 --> 20:04.304
VIRGINIA.

20:04.304 --> 20:06.276
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

20:06.276 --> 20:09.779
WHAT DO YOU MEAN? WE'RE GOING
TO WATCH CARLOS' BAND PLAY.

20:09.779 --> 20:12.812
YOU INVITED ME THIS MORNING,
REMEMBER?

20:12.812 --> 20:15.315
NO, UH, WHAT I REMEMBER

20:15.315 --> 20:18.318
WAS YOU ASKING ME
TO THE MOVIES TONIGHT,

20:18.318 --> 20:20.320
AND ME SAYING I COULDN'T

20:20.320 --> 20:22.792
BECAUSE I WAS GOING
TO WATCH CARLOS' BAND PLAY.

20:22.792 --> 20:24.794
YOU GOT INVITATION
OUT OF THAT?

20:24.794 --> 20:27.557
WELL, I'M HERE NOW, DEAR,
AND I HAVE THIS LOVELY LIMO.

20:27.557 --> 20:30.630
SO COME ON. WE'LL RIDE OVER
TO THE CLUB IN STYLE.

20:30.630 --> 20:32.302
WELL, HERE'S THE THING.

20:32.302 --> 20:34.804
I'M SUPPOSED TO
GO WITH MY GIRLFRIENDS.

20:34.804 --> 20:37.807
OH, GABY, PLEASE, I WAS
SO LOOKING FORWARD TO THIS.

20:37.807 --> 20:40.640
DON'T MAKE ME GO ALL ALONE.

20:42.512 --> 20:46.616
WELL, I GUESS WE'RE ALL
GOING TO THE SAME PLACE.

20:46.616 --> 20:48.618
I'LL JUST
SEE MY FRIENDS THERE.

20:48.618 --> 20:51.351
OH, GOODY!

20:51.351 --> 20:53.323
(woman) DR. SMITH
TO CARDIAC I.C.U.

20:53.323 --> 20:54.654
WHERE'S ANNE?

20:54.654 --> 20:57.357
OH! SHE'S ASLEEP. SHE'S FINE.
 WHAT HAPPENED?

20:57.357 --> 20:59.929
I WENT OVER TO TALK TO ANNE
ABOUT RECENT DEVELOPMENTS.

20:59.929 --> 21:03.963
YOU WENT TO HER HOUSE?
 YES, I DID, PORTER.
I HAD TO TALK TO ANNE.

21:03.963 --> 21:05.995
I DIDN'T KNOW
THAT HER HUSBAND WAS THERE,

21:05.995 --> 21:07.997
AND HE OVERHEARD US AND...

21:09.999 --> 21:12.672
THE DOCTORS SAY
SHE'S GONNA BE FINE.

21:12.672 --> 21:14.404
PORTER, WH--

21:14.404 --> 21:16.706
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?
DAMN IT!

21:19.849 --> 21:22.852
"TONIC WATER, BOURBON, KETCHUP."
THIS IS YOUR GROCERY LIST?

21:22.852 --> 21:25.855
THERE'S GOT TO BE SOMETHING ELSE
ON DAVE'S PHONE BILL

21:25.855 --> 21:28.358
THAT WILL HELP US.
 UH, THERE ISN'T.

21:28.358 --> 21:32.392
OH, DON'T GET BROCCOLI.
IT IS NOT YOUR FRIEND.

21:32.392 --> 21:34.694
YOU'RE TELLING ME
THAT YOU CROSS-CHECKED

21:34.694 --> 21:37.697
ALL THOSE OTHER NUMBERS,
AND THERE WAS NOTHING?
 SQUAT.

21:37.697 --> 21:39.999
THE KEY IS THIS DOCTOR GUY.
 YEAH.

21:39.999 --> 21:43.072
MAYBE WE SHOULD JUST BITE
THE BULLET AND GO TO BOSTON.

21:43.072 --> 21:46.576
YEAH. MAYBE WE CAN GET MORE
OUT OF HIM FACE-TO-FACE.

21:57.717 --> 22:00.049
HEY, YOU WANNA GO
TO A ROCK SHOW TONIGHT?

22:00.049 --> 22:02.552
ME? WITH YOU?

22:02.552 --> 22:05.054
WELL, I'M A LITTLE
OUT OF YOUR LEAGUE,

22:05.054 --> 22:07.497
BUT IF IT'LL GET YOU THERE,
SURE.

22:07.497 --> 22:09.559
I DON'T THINK I CAN,
BUT THANKS.

22:09.559 --> 22:13.102
HERE, IN CASE YOU CHANGE
YOUR MIND. (chuckles)

22:29.649 --> 22:31.521
(blues rock music playing)

22:31.521 --> 22:33.383
AND THEN I NOTICED

22:33.383 --> 22:35.485
THAT MARIA'S POCKETS
WERE STUFFED WITH SILVERWARE.

22:35.485 --> 22:39.759
I'M TELLING YOU, IT'S IMPOSSIBLE
TO FIND GOOD HELP THESE DAYS.

22:39.759 --> 22:41.761
WELL, YOU'LL KNOW
SOON ENOUGH

22:41.761 --> 22:44.394
WHEN MY CHOLESTEROL FINALLY
GETS THE BETTER OF ME.

22:44.394 --> 22:46.666
DON'T TALK LIKE THAT.

22:46.666 --> 22:50.400
YOU WANT A CHEESEBURGER
OR SOMETHING?

22:53.102 --> 22:56.145
THAT HAS GOT TO STOP.
I'M GONNA DO SOMETHING.

22:56.145 --> 22:58.648
WHY?
JULIE'S A GROWN WOMAN.

22:58.648 --> 23:01.711
UH-HUH, SHE'S A GROWN WOMAN
WITH STARS IN HER EYES

23:01.711 --> 23:05.455
WHO'S IN LOVE
WITH A 3-TIME LOSER.

23:05.455 --> 23:07.757
IF SHE WANTS TO ACCEPT
HIS PROPOSAL,

23:07.757 --> 23:09.419
THAT'S HER BUSINESS.

23:09.419 --> 23:12.662
BUT IN THE MEANTIME, YOU'RE NOT
GONNA RUIN HIS SURPRISE.

23:12.662 --> 23:14.664
AREN'T I?
 NO.

23:14.664 --> 23:17.166
AREN'T I?
 NO.

23:17.166 --> 23:21.731
(both speaking inaudibly)

23:21.731 --> 23:24.403
YOU'RE RIGHT.

23:24.403 --> 23:26.405
I'LL STAY OUT OF IT.

23:31.581 --> 23:34.444
OH, NOW WHERE IS
THE LITTLE GIRLS' ROOM?

23:36.546 --> 23:39.519
HEY, WHY DID THAT GUY
