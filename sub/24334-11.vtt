*

00:28.296 --> 00:30.864
:
* No one knows what it's like *

00:30.898 --> 00:33.033
* To be the bad man *

00:34.402 --> 00:36.404
* To be the sad man *

00:38.038 --> 00:40.441
* Behind blue eyes *

00:41.875 --> 00:44.745
* No one knows what it's like *

00:44.778 --> 00:46.814
* To be hated *

00:48.149 --> 00:50.151
* To be fated *

00:51.385 --> 00:54.122
* To telling only lies *

00:54.155 --> 00:58.092
* But my dreams *

00:58.126 --> 01:00.561
* They aren't as empty *

01:01.595 --> 01:04.132
* As my conscience *

01:04.165 --> 01:06.634
* Seems to be *

01:08.236 --> 01:11.705
* I have hours *

01:11.739 --> 01:13.941
* Only lonely *

01:15.109 --> 01:17.311
* My love is vengeance *

01:18.412 --> 01:20.981
* That's never free... *

01:26.620 --> 01:28.622
:
* No one comprehends this pain *

01:30.090 --> 01:33.060
* Feels this feeling *

01:33.093 --> 01:36.297
* Like me *

01:36.330 --> 01:39.833
* And I blame you *

01:39.867 --> 01:44.071
* No one controls themselves
like this *

01:44.104 --> 01:45.906
* His anger *

01:45.939 --> 01:47.441
* His pain *

01:47.475 --> 01:50.578
* My pain and fear *

01:50.611 --> 01:53.247
* Cannot be revealed *

01:53.281 --> 01:56.350
BOTH:
* But my dreams *

01:56.384 --> 01:59.052
* They aren't as empty *

02:00.120 --> 02:02.290

* My love is vengeance *

02:16.804 --> 02:19.640
* That's never free *

02:19.673 --> 02:21.542
My love is vengeance.

02:21.575 --> 02:23.711
That's never free.

02:23.744 --> 02:25.846

SYD'S VOICE:
David?

03:08.389 --> 03:10.391
*

03:41.088 --> 03:44.425
* When my fist clenches,
crack it open *

03:44.458 --> 03:47.561
* Before I use it
and lose my cool *

03:47.595 --> 03:49.797
* When I smile *

03:49.830 --> 03:51.799
* Tell me some bad news *

03:51.832 --> 03:55.068
* Before I laugh
and act like a fool... *

03:56.804 --> 03:58.739
FAROUK :
* If I am evil *

04:00.240 --> 04:03.076
-* Purify me *

04:03.110 --> 04:04.912
* If I shiver... *

04:04.945 --> 04:06.914
DAVID:
* When I shiver *

04:06.947 --> 04:10.083
:
* Please give me a blanket *

04:10.117 --> 04:12.920
* Keep me warm,
let me wear your coat *

04:12.953 --> 04:14.688
*

04:20.160 --> 04:22.563
* No one knows what it's like *

04:22.596 --> 04:24.498
* To be the bad man *

04:26.166 --> 04:30.270
* To be the sad man,
man, man, man, man... *

04:43.517 --> 04:46.620
Uh, it's not much, it's, uh,
it's a bit drippy sometimes,

04:48.288 --> 04:49.590
But we're happy.

04:49.623 --> 04:51.291
Cube sweet cube.

04:51.325 --> 04:53.293
We've been here
for about an hour.

04:53.327 --> 04:55.262
No. What's the word?

04:55.295 --> 04:57.498
Um... "soup"?

04:58.699 --> 05:00.167
No, don't think it's soup.

05:00.200 --> 05:03.136
We've been here
longer than that.

05:03.170 --> 05:04.605
Anyhoo...

05:04.638 --> 05:07.475
Oh. What happened.
Uh, well...

05:07.508 --> 05:09.477
the world ended.

05:09.510 --> 05:12.212
: Oh... sweetheart,
don't be so dramatic.

05:12.245 --> 05:13.881
-It didn't end.
-It...

05:13.914 --> 05:15.816
-It's still out there.
-I'm exaggerating.

05:15.849 --> 05:17.651
-Sunrise, sunset.
-She had some...

05:17.685 --> 05:20.120
-You know, everybody
toiling away.
-Toil, toil, toil.

05:20.153 --> 05:22.456
-You know, good versus evil,
all that sort of thing.
-Mm-hmm.

05:22.490 --> 05:23.724
We just...

05:23.757 --> 05:26.126
well, we just don't...

05:26.159 --> 05:28.128
-do that sort of thing anymore.
-No.

05:28.161 --> 05:31.131
We were just losing
too much hair.

05:31.164 --> 05:33.534
Time. Time.

05:33.567 --> 05:35.669
It was time that we were losing,

05:35.703 --> 05:38.305
uh, my beloved and I.

05:38.338 --> 05:39.673
Mm.

05:39.707 --> 05:41.675
-Groom and bride.
-Hmm.

05:41.709 --> 05:43.411
-Our bodies.
What do we do with...
-Our bodies.

05:43.444 --> 05:45.212
...what do we do
with our bodies?

05:45.245 --> 05:47.981
They're... safe.

05:48.015 --> 05:49.550
Um, somewhere.

05:49.583 --> 05:51.018
They're hidden.

05:51.051 --> 05:55.556
To tell you the location
would be un... genius.

05:55.589 --> 05:57.658
I-It's actually better
without them.

05:57.691 --> 06:00.060
-Mm.
-You know, all those
aches and pains and...

06:00.093 --> 06:01.829
-aging.
-Mm-hmm.

06:01.862 --> 06:03.597
Not to mention various gases.

06:03.631 --> 06:05.599
:
Oh! Stop.

06:05.633 --> 06:07.868
Oh, but it's
so much more romantic now.

06:07.901 --> 06:09.336
It's just...

06:09.369 --> 06:11.905
well, every meal is a feast,

06:11.939 --> 06:13.741
-every day a blessing.
-Hmm.

06:15.743 --> 06:18.178
"O dandelion, rich and haughty,

06:18.211 --> 06:20.180
"King of village flowers!

06:20.213 --> 06:22.950
"Each day is coronation time,

06:22.983 --> 06:25.519
"You have no humble hours.

06:25.553 --> 06:27.421
"I like to see you
bring a troop

06:27.455 --> 06:30.357
"To beat the bluegrass spears,

06:30.390 --> 06:32.225
"To scorn the lawnmower

06:32.259 --> 06:36.129
"that would be like
fate's triumphant shears.

06:36.163 --> 06:39.967
"Your yellow heads
are cut away,

06:40.000 --> 06:43.236
"It seems your reign is o'er.

06:43.270 --> 06:46.139
"By noon you raise
a sea of stars

06:46.173 --> 06:49.109
More golden than before."

06:49.142 --> 06:50.911
*

06:55.182 --> 06:58.151
-We miss them, our friends.
-We miss people. Of course.

06:58.185 --> 07:00.220
-You know, our coworkers,
-Mm-hmm.

07:00.253 --> 07:01.589
like, um...

07:01.622 --> 07:04.592
of course, uh,
Glasses McLabcoat

07:04.625 --> 07:07.194
and, uh, the...

07:08.662 --> 07:10.230
-...the-the girl who would kick,
-Oh.

07:10.263 --> 07:12.432
-kick everyone, I miss her.
-Yeah.

07:12.466 --> 07:14.802
Oh, and Sydney.
Don't forget Sydney.

07:14.835 --> 07:17.437
-I had forgotten Sydney, yes.
-Oh, it...

07:17.471 --> 07:19.473
oh, what happened to her
was so sad.

07:19.507 --> 07:22.643
Very sad. Uh...

07:22.676 --> 07:25.245
: What was it
that happened to her again?

07:25.278 --> 07:27.314
-The betrayal.
-She was betrayed.

07:27.347 --> 07:29.349
-After the fight with Farouk,
-Mm.

07:29.382 --> 07:31.418
when David...

07:31.451 --> 07:33.153
-The Turn.
-...turned.

07:33.186 --> 07:34.622
The Turn. Uh...

07:34.655 --> 07:37.090
there was a great battle with...

07:37.124 --> 07:38.659
what's his face.

07:38.692 --> 07:40.460
-Fa... Farouk.
-Farouk. Farouk.

07:40.494 --> 07:43.263
Uh, very soothing voice,
I found. Very hypnotic.

07:43.296 --> 07:44.665
Mmm.

07:47.367 --> 07:49.469
I remember helping him.

07:52.005 --> 07:54.875
Yes, I... I do, too.

07:59.680 --> 08:01.014
Hmm.

08:02.883 --> 08:06.219
Why did he turn again,
this David person?

08:08.889 --> 08:12.492
Because she showed him
his future.

08:27.775 --> 08:30.310
No.

08:30.343 --> 08:33.714
-No, no, no, no.

08:42.255 --> 08:44.257
SYD:
We need to talk.

08:45.759 --> 08:47.160
Sure.

08:47.194 --> 08:49.429
Let me just finish killing
this asshole.

08:52.099 --> 08:55.335
You haven't had a lot of
girlfriends, or you'd know--

08:55.368 --> 08:58.572
when a woman wants to talk,
you talk.

09:01.208 --> 09:03.410
Could you maybe not point
that thing at me?

09:03.443 --> 09:06.046
You read the stories.

09:06.079 --> 09:09.516
The women who marry serial
killers and have six kids--

09:09.549 --> 09:12.185
meanwhile, he's driving
around Portland every night

09:12.219 --> 09:14.722
with a van full of duct tape.

09:15.756 --> 09:17.691
What?

09:17.725 --> 09:19.526
They have to know.

09:19.559 --> 09:22.596
Right? The wives, deep down.

09:22.630 --> 09:26.566
At least a feeling,
something's wrong.

09:26.600 --> 09:30.570
I know, with you. Now.

09:30.604 --> 09:32.472
Syd, I'm the good guy.

09:32.505 --> 09:34.541
He's the monster.

09:34.574 --> 09:36.076
No.

09:38.445 --> 09:40.413
You're not that.

09:40.447 --> 09:43.150
A good guy?

09:43.183 --> 09:45.552
I thought so for a long time.

09:45.585 --> 09:48.789
And then I saw
the things you hide.

09:52.626 --> 09:55.328
And it hit me.

09:55.362 --> 09:57.931
What if you're not the hero?

09:57.965 --> 10:00.400
What if you're
just another villain?

10:00.433 --> 10:02.836
The real villain.

10:05.272 --> 10:07.240
Why? 'Cause...

10:07.274 --> 10:09.843
because I didn't tell you
the whole truth?

10:09.877 --> 10:12.112
Because I

10:14.114 --> 10:16.416
-He kills people.
-You...

10:16.449 --> 10:18.986
kill people.

10:19.019 --> 10:21.454
Dozens at Division 3 last year.

10:21.488 --> 10:23.590
No. That was him.

10:23.623 --> 10:25.859
He had c-control.

10:25.893 --> 10:28.095
The Son of Sam had a dog
who gave him commands,

10:28.128 --> 10:32.632
but every time he pulled the
trigger, he pulled the trigger.

10:36.169 --> 10:38.005
Seriously,
why are you doing this?

10:38.038 --> 10:40.207
I... know.

10:40.240 --> 10:42.142
That's the thing.

10:42.175 --> 10:43.811
I've seen your true face.

10:43.844 --> 10:46.847
You hid it so well.

10:50.183 --> 10:52.152
I love you.

10:52.185 --> 10:54.654
Maybe.

10:54.688 --> 10:56.656
But here's what matters more.

10:56.690 --> 10:59.059
You lie to me.

10:59.092 --> 11:01.995
You leave me.

11:02.029 --> 11:04.364
-You keep secrets.
-No.

11:07.600 --> 11:10.503
You're doing it right now.

11:10.537 --> 11:13.640
Unless maybe you don't know
the difference-- truth, lie.

11:13.673 --> 11:15.175
Maybe...

11:15.208 --> 11:17.878
it's not even your fault.

11:17.911 --> 11:22.315
He was in your head for so long,
poisoning every thought.

11:22.349 --> 11:25.352
Are you okay? Y-Your neck,
that's a lot of blood.

11:25.385 --> 11:27.154
It's not mine.

11:27.187 --> 11:30.523
Listen to me,
I know it's been hard...

11:30.557 --> 11:32.726
I saw what you did to Oliver.

11:32.760 --> 11:35.395
To the soldiers at Division 3.

11:35.428 --> 11:37.765
I saw the look on your face.

11:37.798 --> 11:40.067
You liked it.

11:40.100 --> 11:42.202
No, I did what I had to.

11:42.235 --> 11:44.271
You tortured Oliver.

11:44.304 --> 11:46.173
You were beating him to death.

11:46.206 --> 11:48.809
That's not a love story.

11:53.046 --> 11:54.848
*

11:54.882 --> 11:56.249
Wait, I...

11:56.283 --> 11:58.685
I'm just, we're just,
this is...

11:58.718 --> 12:01.621
We're just doing
what you said. You.

12:01.654 --> 12:03.056
This is war. We're in a war.

12:03.090 --> 12:04.291
What am I willing to do?

12:04.324 --> 12:06.760
How far am I willing to go?

12:06.794 --> 12:08.695
-I know I said that, but...
-And that's all I'm doing.

12:08.728 --> 12:10.730
That is all I am doing--
what you said.

12:10.764 --> 12:12.432
No. No.

12:12.465 --> 12:13.901
Baby, please.

12:13.934 --> 12:15.969
What happened
to "God loves the sinners best"?

12:22.109 --> 12:24.177
:
It won't work.

12:25.245 --> 12:27.280
We're all powerless now.

12:27.314 --> 12:29.950
Goddamn it, put the gun down
and talk to me.

12:29.983 --> 12:31.651
He's gonna... it's gonna
wear off, and then he'll be--

12:31.684 --> 12:33.086
you heard them-- unstoppable.

12:33.120 --> 12:36.156
And, look, I'm sorry
if you have abandonment issues.

12:36.189 --> 12:38.625
And I was taken away by you,
if we're being--

12:38.658 --> 12:40.227
if we're laying all our cards
out on the table,

12:40.260 --> 12:41.728
so think about that.
I didn't leave.

12:41.761 --> 12:43.263
You kidnapped me
from the future.

12:43.296 --> 12:45.632
Did you ever ask why?
Why would I do that?

12:45.665 --> 12:47.734
Reach out from the future?

12:47.767 --> 12:49.469
Why ask you to help Farouk
find his body?

12:49.502 --> 12:51.338
Because of the world--
the end of the world?

12:51.371 --> 12:53.974
And who does that,
end the world

12:54.007 --> 12:56.143
Otherwise, why would I ask you
to save him?

12:56.176 --> 12:59.079
I don't know. You wouldn't,
you didn't tell me.

12:59.112 --> 13:02.749
-It's you.

13:02.782 --> 13:05.785
You're the one who destroys
everything, who ends the world.

13:12.225 --> 13:14.027
No.

13:14.061 --> 13:15.662
It never occurred to you

13:15.695 --> 13:18.465
that you're the problem,
not the solution.

13:18.498 --> 13:22.302
-H-How could you even...
-He showed me-- Farouk.

13:22.335 --> 13:24.671
He went to see her, too--
me, in the future--

13:24.704 --> 13:26.773
after you quit.

13:26.806 --> 13:29.176
See, in her timeline,
you killed Farouk,

13:29.209 --> 13:31.478
and then there was no one
powerful enough to stop you

13:31.511 --> 13:33.446
-when you turned.
-When I...

13:33.480 --> 13:37.050
So she tricked you
into helping him-- your enemy--

13:37.084 --> 13:38.818
so that he could stop you

13:38.852 --> 13:41.254
when you showed us
who you really are.

13:45.392 --> 13:48.528
I know.

13:48.561 --> 13:51.498
It's cold to do that to someone
that you used to love.

13:51.531 --> 13:53.967
Used to?

13:54.001 --> 13:57.304
Baby, please, I'm right here.

13:57.337 --> 14:02.109
Your man. Don't you trust me?

14:11.118 --> 14:14.121
Maybe I just trust myself more.

14:17.090 --> 14:19.526
No. He's...

14:19.559 --> 14:22.562
You're being tricked.
Syd, please.

14:25.232 --> 14:29.069
Syd, please.

14:29.102 --> 14:31.071
You know me.

14:31.104 --> 14:33.240
Yeah, I do.

14:33.273 --> 14:35.708
And guess what?
You're not the hero.

14:35.742 --> 14:38.045
Then who is?

14:40.647 --> 14:42.282
Me.

14:49.656 --> 14:51.858
NARRATOR : A delusion
starts like any other idea,

14:51.891 --> 14:53.961
as an egg.

14:53.994 --> 14:55.395
Identical on the outside,

14:55.428 --> 14:58.298
perfectly formed.

14:58.331 --> 15:01.868
From the shell, you'd never
know anything was wrong.

15:01.901 --> 15:03.470
A delusion starts

15:03.503 --> 15:07.307
like any other idea,
as an egg.

15:07.340 --> 15:10.277
Identical on the outside,
perfectly formed.

15:10.310 --> 15:11.711
DIVAD:
You see it now,

15:14.481 --> 15:17.750
A delusion starts
like any other idea...

15:17.784 --> 15:21.088
Stop it. Stop it.

15:21.121 --> 15:23.456
...as an egg.

15:23.490 --> 15:26.059
NARRATOR: A delusion starts
like any other idea,

15:26.093 --> 15:27.227
as an egg.

15:27.260 --> 15:28.628
You're the chicken, man.

15:33.600 --> 15:35.935
She said I killed
all those people...

15:35.969 --> 15:39.572
-in the future.
-You're delusional, baby.

15:39.606 --> 15:42.642
No, I'm not.
I'm not crazy. I'm not.

15:42.675 --> 15:44.644
All the voices,
the things I saw,

15:44.677 --> 15:46.513
they said I was schizophrenic,
but that was a...

15:46.546 --> 15:49.749
They didn't know the truth,
what I am, who I am.

15:49.782 --> 15:51.451
I have powers, I'm powerful.

15:51.484 --> 15:55.355
And then Syd came,
and now I know.

15:55.388 --> 15:57.757
-I know that I'm...
What?

15:57.790 --> 15:59.126
Normal?

15:59.159 --> 16:01.494
No. Special.

16:01.528 --> 16:05.132
A mutant. Omega.

16:05.165 --> 16:07.500
-I'm the one who saves them.

16:07.534 --> 16:10.703
-Everybody. I-I-I'm the hero.

16:10.737 --> 16:13.940
I save love. You get it?
Farouk, he's the devil.

16:13.973 --> 16:16.343
What he did to me,
what he does to everybody...

16:16.376 --> 16:18.878
Why can't she see that?

16:18.911 --> 16:21.281
-Saint David.
-No, I'm not saying that.

16:21.314 --> 16:23.783
I make mistakes, but...

16:23.816 --> 16:25.785
I'm trying to help people.

16:25.818 --> 16:28.888
A delusion starts

NARRATOR: ...starts
like any other idea...

16:33.260 --> 16:35.562
You stop saying that.

16:38.165 --> 16:41.368
You know what your delusion is?

16:48.341 --> 16:52.079
Hold the phone.
Is that...

16:52.112 --> 16:55.048
Ooh, a dark horse candidate,

16:55.082 --> 16:58.017
late entry to the race.

17:07.127 --> 17:11.098
DIVAD:
There. You see it?

17:15.435 --> 17:18.371
The egg cracked just then,

17:18.405 --> 17:21.108
and the delusion was born.

17:23.143 --> 17:26.146
What are you talking about?

17:33.786 --> 17:36.223
I'm a good person.

17:36.256 --> 17:39.259
I deserve love.

17:41.428 --> 17:43.430
I'm a good person.

17:44.431 --> 17:46.899
I deserve love.

17:46.933 --> 17:49.236
DIVAD: In order
for a delusion to thrive,

17:49.269 --> 17:52.805
other, more rational ideas
must be destroyed.

17:52.839 --> 17:55.542
I'm a good person.

17:55.575 --> 17:57.877
So I deserve love.

17:57.910 --> 18:01.614
No. That's not...

18:01.648 --> 18:04.050
She saved me.

18:04.083 --> 18:06.786
She showed me what I could be.

18:06.819 --> 18:08.054
She made me good.

18:08.087 --> 18:10.123
She made you good?

18:10.157 --> 18:12.159
So, what,
you weren't good before?

18:12.192 --> 18:14.327
David Haller,
the little piece of shit.

18:14.361 --> 18:17.330
No, that's not...
That's just... words.

18:17.364 --> 18:18.898
You're-you're-you're trying
to confuse me.

18:18.931 --> 18:22.269
She said, "Junkies
and masochists and hookers

18:22.302 --> 18:24.237
"and those who have
squandered everything

18:24.271 --> 18:26.072
are the ring of brightest angels
around heaven."

18:26.105 --> 18:28.074
Oh, I remember.

18:28.107 --> 18:30.477
God loves the sinners best.

18:30.510 --> 18:31.778
NARRATOR :
A delusion starts...

18:34.781 --> 18:37.517
Do you really believe that?

18:37.550 --> 18:40.587
Deep down

18:40.620 --> 18:42.689
DVD:
Don't listen to him.

18:42.722 --> 18:44.824
There is no God.

18:44.857 --> 18:46.293
Except you.

18:46.326 --> 18:49.296
So the question is,
do you love yourself?

18:49.329 --> 18:51.097
No, that's not what I'm...

18:51.130 --> 18:52.599
She said...

18:52.632 --> 18:54.434
Stop doing that!

18:54.467 --> 18:56.002
Making her right. All of them.

18:56.035 --> 18:57.504
Caring about what they think.

18:57.537 --> 18:59.672
They owe you everything.

18:59.706 --> 19:01.474
This world.

19:01.508 --> 19:04.477
A baby abandoned by his parents

19:04.511 --> 19:07.480
with a demon stuck in his head.

19:07.514 --> 19:11.017
Used, tricked, judged,

19:11.050 --> 19:14.987
chucked in a Dumpster
like fat from a clinic.

19:15.021 --> 19:17.324
And they tell you it's you.
That you're disgusting,

19:17.357 --> 19:19.292
like somebody's used condom

19:19.326 --> 19:20.660
that keeps getting stuck
to people's shoes.

19:20.693 --> 19:21.994
You want to know the truth?

19:22.028 --> 19:23.663
They're terrified
you're gonna wake up one day

19:23.696 --> 19:25.365
and realize you're a god,

19:25.398 --> 19:27.500
that you don't need any of them.

19:27.534 --> 19:30.370
So they put you
in a mental hospital.

19:30.403 --> 19:31.838
DIVAD:
You are not helping.

19:31.871 --> 19:34.173
He is sick. I'm trying to...

19:34.207 --> 19:35.642
DVD:
No, they're sick.

19:35.675 --> 19:37.176
She's sick.

19:37.210 --> 19:39.646
This blonde thing
who pretends to love us,

19:39.679 --> 19:43.049
lowers our defenses,
crawls inside our head.

19:43.082 --> 19:44.517
She's the delusion,
the parasite.

19:44.551 --> 19:46.185
Stop it. That is not...

19:46.219 --> 19:48.221
We are in love. That is real.

19:50.623 --> 19:52.592
Our love is real.

19:52.625 --> 19:54.361
Then why'd she just shoot you?

19:56.563 --> 19:58.064
He's got a point.

20:12.211 --> 20:14.914
Oh.

20:16.783 --> 20:19.619
Syd, please. You know me.

20:19.652 --> 20:21.254
Yeah, I do.

20:21.288 --> 20:22.922
Shit.

20:25.224 --> 20:27.927
And guess what?
You're not the hero.

20:27.960 --> 20:30.229
Take that...

20:30.263 --> 20:31.764

Oops.

Yes.

21:41.868 --> 21:43.970
David, I need you to say it.

21:44.003 --> 21:46.439
Yes.

This is going to hurt.

22:57.043 --> 23:00.346
You had a bad dream.

23:15.895 --> 23:18.364
Give me a minute.
What are you gonna do with him?

23:18.397 --> 23:19.799
VERMILLION 1:
There will be a trial.

23:19.832 --> 23:21.367
VERMILLION 3:
You will be expected to testify.

23:21.400 --> 23:22.969
Of course. Just be careful.

23:23.002 --> 23:25.004
Remember, you can't believe
anything he says.

23:33.279 --> 23:36.616
It's, uh, straight to
the electric chair for me, kid.

23:36.649 --> 23:40.086
No, God has plans for you.

23:41.688 --> 23:44.156
I don't believe in God.

23:44.190 --> 23:46.192
I think you do.

You sure you're okay?

24:19.792 --> 24:22.962
Yeah, yeah, just... long day.

24:22.995 --> 24:24.764
Yeah, we fought a Minotaur.

24:24.797 --> 24:26.999
You're pretty beaten up.

24:27.033 --> 24:29.869
Come to the lab,
let me do a CAT scan.

24:29.902 --> 24:32.038
No, I just need some sleep.

24:32.071 --> 24:33.873
I'll join you.

24:33.906 --> 24:37.476
No, if-if you don't mind,
I just need some sleep.

24:37.510 --> 24:38.678
You have your own room.

24:38.711 --> 24:40.112
Just for tonight.

24:40.146 --> 24:41.514
It's right near ours.

24:41.548 --> 24:43.550
I'll show you.

24:45.552 --> 24:48.555

24:55.995 --> 24:59.365

We agreed.

26:41.033 --> 26:42.935
This isn't the plan.

26:42.969 --> 26:44.971
I can fix it.

26:45.004 --> 26:46.773
DVD:
Another delusion.

26:46.806 --> 26:48.340
I just need time.

26:48.374 --> 26:49.942
You saw Syd,
she didn't remember.

26:49.976 --> 26:51.243
A trick. You tricked her.

26:51.277 --> 26:52.679
It can't last.

26:52.712 --> 26:54.914
She's confused.

26:54.947 --> 26:56.515
I just need...
we just need time together

26:56.548 --> 26:59.986
so she can remember
what we had. Have.

27:00.019 --> 27:02.088
No, we don't belong here,
with them.

27:02.121 --> 27:03.790
Anyway, Farouk's still alive.

27:03.823 --> 27:05.124
I got to finish it.

27:05.157 --> 27:07.359
Oh, now you're changing
the story.

27:07.393 --> 27:09.428
Would you just
get out of my head?

27:09.461 --> 27:12.331
I'm trying to think.

27:27.379 --> 27:29.381
DAVID :
Syd, my love...

27:33.920 --> 27:38.524
MAN : Sixth floor
purge in three, two, one...

28:08.254 --> 28:09.421
How are you...?

28:09.455 --> 28:11.657
It's a projection.

28:11.690 --> 28:14.160
My body's in my room,
but my mind's here.

28:14.193 --> 28:17.396
We don't need the White Room
anymore to do this.

28:24.703 --> 28:27.706

I love you so much.

28:30.076 --> 28:32.478
I love you, too.

Syd...

28:37.616 --> 28:39.786
Hmm?

28:39.819 --> 28:42.288
Run away with me.

28:42.321 --> 28:45.124
What?

28:45.157 --> 28:48.694
We just go,
right now, you and me.

28:48.727 --> 28:50.897
Find a cabin
by a lake somewhere.

28:50.930 --> 28:55.301
Get a dog, some chickens.

28:55.334 --> 28:57.036
Start a farm.

28:59.571 --> 29:01.240
What about Farouk?

29:01.273 --> 29:03.075
-After.

29:03.109 --> 29:07.313
The moment he's dead,
we go and never come back.

29:11.150 --> 29:14.153
What?

29:14.186 --> 29:16.188
Nothing.

29:17.456 --> 29:19.458
You seem...

29:20.692 --> 29:23.629
...different.

29:23.662 --> 29:25.932
Maybe it's me.

29:27.266 --> 29:31.170
After everything
we've been through.

29:31.203 --> 29:34.073
We're together now.

Don't you see? It's over.

29:41.647 --> 29:45.784
It's over. We won.

29:45.818 --> 29:47.820
We won.

How's it feel,

knowing I beat you?

30:58.224 --> 31:00.426
Knowing you lost?

31:00.459 --> 31:02.929
Did I?

31:02.962 --> 31:05.364
Well, you're in a cage,
powerless,

31:05.397 --> 31:06.865
about to be executed.

31:06.899 --> 31:08.867
Oh, no,

31:08.901 --> 31:10.869
they won't kill me.

31:10.903 --> 31:14.273
I'm too...

31:14.306 --> 31:17.043
Valuable.

31:17.076 --> 31:20.879
They'll put me deep
in a basement somewhere,

31:20.913 --> 31:22.548
a secret weapon.

31:22.581 --> 31:25.551
No, you're gonna die.

31:25.584 --> 31:28.454
What makes you so sure?

31:28.487 --> 31:32.224
Because if they don't kill you
tomorrow,

31:32.258 --> 31:33.625
I will.

31:33.659 --> 31:36.062
Mm-hmm.

31:36.095 --> 31:39.398
You tried once,

31:39.431 --> 31:42.168
and yet here I am.

31:43.735 --> 31:46.105
You know what I missed the most,

31:46.138 --> 31:49.976
being locked in that grave
for 30 years?

31:50.977 --> 31:52.945
Coffee.

31:52.979 --> 31:55.747
Be a dear and make me a cup.

31:55.781 --> 31:58.817
No.

31:58.850 --> 32:01.653
I give the orders now.

32:01.687 --> 32:03.655
It wasn't an order.

32:03.689 --> 32:05.657
It was a request.

32:05.691 --> 32:07.994
The last request of a dying man.

32:08.027 --> 32:10.596
Don't do that--

32:10.629 --> 32:13.232
try to make me feel sympathy
for you.

32:13.265 --> 32:15.801
Why not?

32:15.834 --> 32:17.503
Is it working?

32:19.505 --> 32:21.940
Go to hell.

32:22.941 --> 32:25.244
I'm leaving.

32:25.277 --> 32:27.646
I just came to...

32:27.679 --> 32:29.648
What

32:29.681 --> 32:31.083
No.

32:31.117 --> 32:34.286
To say good-bye.

32:35.787 --> 32:38.157
Good-bye.

32:38.190 --> 32:40.126
It's really sick,

32:40.159 --> 32:42.294
what you're doing to her.

32:42.328 --> 32:44.063
Don't you think?

32:49.468 --> 32:51.137
Your love.

32:52.838 --> 32:53.805
How do y...

32:53.839 --> 32:56.208
The horse with the bridle

32:56.242 --> 32:58.310
can still walk.

32:58.344 --> 33:01.213
I saw you on the hill,

33:01.247 --> 33:03.215
what you did to her--

33:03.249 --> 33:05.651
suppressing her memory,

33:05.684 --> 33:08.220
tricking her
into loving you again.

33:08.254 --> 33:10.222
I didn't trick her.
She loves me.

33:10.256 --> 33:11.990
She just f-forgot.

33:12.024 --> 33:13.725
Oh, and you helped her remember

33:13.759 --> 33:16.062
by controlling her.

33:16.095 --> 33:18.064
What a kind man you are.

33:18.097 --> 33:19.731
Shut up.

33:19.765 --> 33:21.333
Trust me...

33:21.367 --> 33:23.835
You can't make someone love you.

33:23.869 --> 33:25.571
I've tried.

33:25.604 --> 33:27.906
With who, your toadies?

33:27.939 --> 33:30.008
No.

33:30.042 --> 33:31.710
With you.

33:31.743 --> 33:35.714
For 30 years,
since you were a baby.

33:35.747 --> 33:37.216
My baby.

33:37.249 --> 33:39.318
Oh, please.

33:39.351 --> 33:40.719
You make me sick.

33:40.752 --> 33:42.488
You know that? Physically sick.

33:42.521 --> 33:44.323
Every time I look at you,
every time I hear your voice,

33:44.356 --> 33:47.025
I want to throw up.

33:47.059 --> 33:48.860
Good.

33:48.894 --> 33:51.597
Remember that feeling,

33:51.630 --> 33:54.433
because soon you will see it
in her eyes

33:54.466 --> 33:57.303
when she looks at you.

34:06.645 --> 34:08.647
*

34:27.399 --> 34:30.469
SYD :
I love you, too.

34:45.417 --> 34:48.287
You look ridiculous.

34:48.320 --> 34:51.290
I'm reconstructing
what happened on the hill

34:51.323 --> 34:53.292
from available sensor data.

34:53.325 --> 34:55.761
Did I tell you I cut off
the head of a Minotaur?

34:55.794 --> 34:57.963
Yes, you did. In graphic detail.

34:57.996 --> 35:00.399
Do you know what its blood
smelled like?

35:00.432 --> 35:01.967
Oh, please, Kerry...

35:02.000 --> 35:03.969
Okay, this is weird.

35:04.002 --> 35:06.572
You remember those, like,
beef bouillon cubes

35:06.605 --> 35:08.407
-Stop.

35:08.440 --> 35:10.142
The kind that you would pour
boiling water onto?

35:10.176 --> 35:12.144
Stop.

35:12.178 --> 35:15.181
It didn't taste like that,
though.

35:21.853 --> 35:23.289
Oh, no.

35:24.323 --> 35:26.725
KERRY:
What?

35:33.632 --> 35:36.001
It's treachery.

36:50.709 --> 36:52.711
*

37:32.484 --> 37:35.521
(faint, distorted
whispers fading)

37:45.331 --> 37:47.333

CARY:
In the old days--

38:42.721 --> 38:45.391
not so long ago--

38:45.424 --> 38:48.026
madmen were packed onto boats

38:48.059 --> 38:51.463
and shipped off to sea.

38:51.497 --> 38:55.434
They were said to be searching
for their lost sanity.

38:57.369 --> 38:59.571
They called these boats...

38:59.605 --> 39:01.973
the Ship of Fools.

39:02.007 --> 39:05.010
*

39:05.043 --> 39:08.146
And for a long time,
we thought

39:08.179 --> 39:10.516
we were the sane ones,

39:10.549 --> 39:13.852
left behind on dry land.

39:17.055 --> 39:20.726
But what if we're not?

39:20.759 --> 39:23.194
What if so much time has passed

39:23.228 --> 39:25.597
that we've forgotten the truth?

39:27.298 --> 39:29.367
That we are, in fact,

39:29.401 --> 39:32.871
the fools...

39:32.904 --> 39:35.874
afloat on an endless sea,

39:35.907 --> 39:39.210
pretending to be...

39:39.244 --> 39:41.346
normal.

39:41.379 --> 39:43.381

40:07.072 --> 40:08.406
David.

40:08.440 --> 40:10.241
Over here.

40:13.411 --> 40:16.281
Just want to thank you.

40:16.314 --> 40:18.283
You saved us all.

40:18.316 --> 40:20.251
That's what I do.
Where's Farouk?

40:20.285 --> 40:21.953
They're bringing him in now.

40:21.987 --> 40:24.723
Let me just... I have a few
questions before we get started.

40:24.756 --> 40:26.592
Let me just grab my pad.

40:29.194 --> 40:31.296
: Yeah, okay.

40:41.439 --> 40:44.109
Aah! Syd? What's...

40:49.280 --> 40:50.516
Whoa!

41:08.033 --> 41:10.401
Aw...

41:21.647 --> 41:23.448
SYD:
David, stop.

41:23.481 --> 41:24.650
Please?

41:27.485 --> 41:30.188
-SYD: I know that you don't want

41:30.221 --> 41:31.690
to believe me,

41:31.723 --> 41:33.992
-but we want to help you.
-Let me out. Now.

41:34.025 --> 41:35.994
VERMILLION 1: David Haller, your
treachery has been discovered.

41:36.027 --> 41:38.463
The inevitability
of your future crimes.

41:38.496 --> 41:41.232
VERMILLION 3: We are informed
by Sydney Barrett

and the Shadow King
of events that will transpire

41:43.569 --> 41:45.036
in the days to come.

41:45.070 --> 41:48.239
The remains of the orb that
took you have been analyzed.

41:48.273 --> 41:50.241
The probability
that they have been created

41:50.275 --> 41:54.512
decades from now
by the male Loudermilk is 98%.

42:00.451 --> 42:02.353
Th... This is a mistake.

42:02.387 --> 42:04.823
Future crimes?

42:04.856 --> 42:07.158
Things I might do?
Are you...

42:07.192 --> 42:08.193
Wha...?

42:08.226 --> 42:09.661
Wait.

42:09.695 --> 42:12.230
What's...

42:12.263 --> 42:15.033
what's really going on?

42:20.405 --> 42:22.741
-This is you.

42:22.774 --> 42:25.911
Seeing you like this--

42:25.944 --> 42:28.046
what you have become--

42:28.079 --> 42:31.717
the sweet boy
undone by revenge...

42:34.252 --> 42:38.523
...it fills my heart
with such sorrow.

42:38.556 --> 42:40.626
Liar.

42:40.659 --> 42:44.596
SYD: David, I know
how hard this was for you.

42:44.630 --> 42:47.599
What he did to you.

42:47.633 --> 42:49.901
The life that you lived.

42:49.935 --> 42:52.638
To think that you were sick
for all those years,

42:52.671 --> 42:55.040
and then to be told
that it was a lie,

42:55.073 --> 42:56.775
that you have these powers.

43:00.245 --> 43:02.580
This monster in your head,
everything Melanie said,

43:02.614 --> 43:04.282
that you weren't mentally ill,

43:04.315 --> 43:06.885
-when the truth is...
-Syd.

43:06.918 --> 43:08.954
...you're both.

43:12.624 --> 43:14.125
DIVAD:
I told you.

43:14.159 --> 43:15.894
Why didn't you listen?

43:15.927 --> 43:17.162
DVD:
You see what she is?

43:17.195 --> 43:18.596
What they are?

43:18.630 --> 43:20.331
Small-minded animals,

43:20.365 --> 43:22.567
terrified of what
they can't comprehend.

43:22.600 --> 43:24.169
No, shut up and let me think.

43:27.372 --> 43:29.340
Just let me think.

43:33.144 --> 43:34.445
Uh...

43:35.881 --> 43:38.917
Something I do in the future?

43:38.950 --> 43:42.087
That hasn't happened yet?

43:42.120 --> 43:44.923
That isn't even me?

43:47.325 --> 43:50.128
Don't you see? This is
some kind of mass psychosis.

43:50.161 --> 43:52.130
CARY:
You're upset.

43:52.163 --> 43:54.365
Your mind can't reconcile
the person we see

43:54.399 --> 43:56.534
with the person
you think you are.

43:56.567 --> 43:58.336
SYD:
But we can help.

43:58.369 --> 44:01.139
Medicine and therapy.

44:03.341 --> 44:05.576
Back to the psych ward?

44:08.546 --> 44:10.648
David the zombie.

44:15.754 --> 44:18.156
Well, bullshit.

44:18.189 --> 44:20.558
You want me gone so bad?
Fine, I'm gone.

44:20.591 --> 44:22.227
-No.
-VERMILLION 1:
You will allow treatment,

44:28.066 --> 44:29.367
Get out.

44:29.400 --> 44:32.537
No. No.

44:32.570 --> 44:35.540
I want to hear you say it.
That you're gonna kill me

44:35.573 --> 44:37.843
if I don't let them turn me
into something different.

44:37.876 --> 44:40.011
Something easy.

44:40.045 --> 44:43.281
Something clean.

44:53.258 --> 44:54.625
David.

44:55.961 --> 44:58.096
You drugged me...

45:00.598 --> 45:03.268
...and had sex with me.

45:04.970 --> 45:07.538
:
No, that's not...

45:22.453 --> 45:24.455
I need you.

45:38.469 --> 45:40.638
I am a good person.

I deserve love.
