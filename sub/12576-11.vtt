WEBVTT

00:56.765 --> 00:57.932
Come on, Hank.

00:58.016 --> 00:59.809
Your mom's flight arrives in half an hour.

00:59.893 --> 01:01.978
Hold on, I got to do a color check.

01:02.896 --> 01:05.315
Let's see, red, blue, green, white

01:05.315 --> 01:06.983
red, blue, green, white, red...

01:07.067 --> 01:08.818
Hank, aren't you excited
to see your mother?

01:08.902 --> 01:10.445
'Course I'm excited to see her.

01:10.445 --> 01:12.405
I haven't seen her in two years.

01:12.489 --> 01:14.741
It's the boyfriend I'm worried about.

01:16.910 --> 01:19.871
You know, it's about time.
You got used to this, Hank.

01:19.871 --> 01:21.998
Your mother told you almost a year ago

01:22.082 --> 01:23.291
that she had a boyfriend.

01:23.291 --> 01:25.001
She said gentleman friend.

01:25.085 --> 01:26.878
I didn't know it was the same thing.

01:26.878 --> 01:29.339
I thought they'd just sit and have tea

01:29.339 --> 01:31.716
and talk about how good the tea is,

01:31.800 --> 01:34.177
you know, not too hot, that kind of thing.

01:34.177 --> 01:36.513
Well, I've never heard
your mother so happy.

01:36.513 --> 01:38.264
Come on. Just give this guy a chance.

01:38.348 --> 01:40.809
Why? He's just going
to use her like a footstool

01:40.809 --> 01:41.893
like dad did.

01:43.061 --> 01:45.772
Rub-a-dub-dub, I think I'm in love.

01:46.606 --> 01:48.024
Oh, Hank, you're exaggerating.

01:48.108 --> 01:51.194
Not really. Oh, great, look,

01:51.194 --> 01:52.779
she's carrying both of the bags,

01:52.779 --> 01:54.197
and he's nowhere to be found.

01:54.781 --> 01:56.533
Well, hello, Tilly. How was your flight?

01:57.200 --> 02:00.078
Well, it was nice
except that we asked for no meat,

02:00.078 --> 02:01.371
and they served us meat,

02:01.371 --> 02:04.207
and we just can't eat meat
since Gary's bypass.

02:04.207 --> 02:06.793
Oh, Hank, it's so good to see you.

02:10.088 --> 02:11.548
Mom, we're in public.

02:11.548 --> 02:12.841
One hand only, okay?

02:12.841 --> 02:14.342
But I've missed you.

02:14.342 --> 02:15.510
Thank you very much.

02:15.510 --> 02:18.721
Well, Hank and I cannot wait
to meet your new man.

02:19.806 --> 02:21.599
We didn't know how to spell his name

02:21.683 --> 02:23.685
so we don't have a stocking for him.

02:23.685 --> 02:26.813
Oh, don't worry.
I'm sure he won't even notice.

02:26.813 --> 02:29.899
Um, he's Jewish, and, uh,
they never did that in his family.

02:29.983 --> 02:32.360
Did they carry suitcases in his family

02:32.360 --> 02:34.696
or does he think that's women's work
like dad did?

02:34.696 --> 02:37.490
Oh, Hank, Gary's nothing like cotton.

02:37.574 --> 02:38.992
He's got a big heart.

02:38.992 --> 02:41.452
Of course, now,
the doctors call it enlarged.

02:42.287 --> 02:43.955
You flush, and where does it go?

02:44.873 --> 02:46.249
Ah, you must be Peggy.

02:46.249 --> 02:47.333
That's right, Peggy.

02:47.417 --> 02:49.669
It is such a pleasure
to meet you, Mr. Kasner.

02:49.669 --> 02:51.546
Mr. Kasner's my father.

02:51.546 --> 02:52.881
Gary. It's Gary.

02:52.881 --> 02:53.882
- Oh!

02:53.882 --> 02:57.177
Hank! I recognize this
from your baby pictures.

02:57.177 --> 03:00.013
I'm glad to meet you at last, boychick.

03:00.013 --> 03:01.181
Hey! Hey, let go.

03:01.181 --> 03:04.434
Never, never! You'll never get away.

03:09.856 --> 03:12.692
Mom, I'll put your stuff
in the den with Luanne.

03:12.692 --> 03:15.486
Uh, Gary, I put a cot
in Bobby's room for you.

03:15.570 --> 03:19.073
No, no, no. Why move everyone around?

03:19.157 --> 03:21.117
Tilly and I can sleep out here
in the living room.

03:22.327 --> 03:23.786
N-no, I don't think so.

03:23.870 --> 03:26.039
Why, doesn't that couch open up?

03:26.039 --> 03:28.416
Uh, yeah, but no, uh...

03:28.416 --> 03:30.919
Hank, don't tell me you're uncomfortable

03:30.919 --> 03:33.713
with the thought of me and Gary
sleeping in the same room?

03:33.713 --> 03:35.965
I didn't have that thought, Mom.

03:36.049 --> 03:37.717
You put that thought in my head,

03:37.717 --> 03:39.928
but now that it's there,
you leave me no choice.

03:39.928 --> 03:40.929
I'm sorry.

03:42.764 --> 03:44.599
I got to drive all the way to Houston

03:44.599 --> 03:46.476
to have Christmas lunch with my dad

03:46.476 --> 03:48.478
and then drive all the way back here

03:48.478 --> 03:51.397
to have Christmas dinner
with my mom and him.

03:51.898 --> 03:54.025
Why do you keep calling him, him?

03:54.651 --> 03:56.152
I just find that odd.

03:56.236 --> 03:58.404
I call him Mr. Kasner

03:58.488 --> 03:59.864
keeping it nice and formal.

03:59.948 --> 04:02.450
Kasner? Is that German?

04:02.450 --> 04:03.826
It's Jewish.

04:06.913 --> 04:09.207
So... he's Jewish?

04:09.207 --> 04:11.167
Yeah, Dale, he's Jewish.

04:11.251 --> 04:14.337
There's nothing wrong with that
in and of itself.

04:14.337 --> 04:15.588
Is he funny?

04:15.672 --> 04:17.340
Well, he doesn't seem too funny.

04:17.340 --> 04:18.841
Seinfeld's funny.

04:18.925 --> 04:20.593
Seinfeld's funnier than Gary.

04:20.677 --> 04:23.096
I'll bet Gary Kasner, is it?

04:23.096 --> 04:24.847
I'll bet he's funnier than Cotton.

04:24.973 --> 04:26.391
Cotton ain't no funny at all, man.

04:26.391 --> 04:27.976
He got that POW Camp, man.

04:27.976 --> 04:29.852
That go, bamboo shoots talking about in

04:29.978 --> 04:31.813
putting them
under danged old fingernails, man.

04:31.813 --> 04:33.064
Don't freak me out about that.

04:33.064 --> 04:35.108
You know, I thought
my mom learned her lesson

04:35.108 --> 04:37.485
when she had the good sense
to dump my dad,

04:37.485 --> 04:39.654
but now she's gone and found another guy

04:39.654 --> 04:41.197
to treat her like a bellboy.

04:42.282 --> 04:44.284
Whoopi Goldberg's funny.

04:44.284 --> 04:46.244
You know, the man won't even eat steak?

04:46.244 --> 04:47.578
Now, what's that about?

04:47.662 --> 04:50.373
Heck, my boss has a bypass surgery
every year,

04:50.373 --> 04:52.125
and he eats all the damn steak he wants.

04:52.125 --> 04:54.919
Oh, that's not the reason
Gary doesn't eat steak, Hank.

04:55.003 --> 04:57.255
It's 'cause the cow is sacred
to his people.

04:57.255 --> 04:59.799
Nope. You're thinking of the Hindus.

04:59.799 --> 05:02.260
The pig is sacred to the Jews.

05:02.260 --> 05:04.846
Well, I wouldn't, myself,
never join a religion

05:04.846 --> 05:06.097
that restricted my diet.

05:06.097 --> 05:08.766
See, I, I don't want
to get into heaven that way.

05:15.315 --> 05:17.567
Hey, we have the same build.

05:17.567 --> 05:19.068
Yeah, I guess so,

05:19.152 --> 05:20.820
but your skin is a little tighter.

05:22.655 --> 05:25.783
Are you a war hero
like my biological grandfather?

05:25.867 --> 05:27.702
A hero? No. No, no.

05:27.702 --> 05:30.955
I spent most of Korea
in a submarine deep in the pacific.

05:31.539 --> 05:32.749
I didn't see much action.

05:32.749 --> 05:35.251
Hey, when you flush on a submarine,

05:35.335 --> 05:36.294
where does it go?

05:37.879 --> 05:38.963
You I like.

05:39.422 --> 05:42.800
You said you I like instead of I like you.

05:43.426 --> 05:45.303
That's funny. I like that.

05:45.303 --> 05:47.513
Wait, that I like.

06:00.735 --> 06:02.737
Hey, good, good, you're up.

06:02.737 --> 06:04.614
What is this I'm eating?

06:04.614 --> 06:06.324
It's some kind of delicious cutlet.

06:06.908 --> 06:07.909
Chicken-fried steak.

06:07.909 --> 06:10.745
Oh, well, I'm going
to count this under chicken.

06:11.621 --> 06:13.289
I'm allowed to have chicken.

06:13.873 --> 06:15.792
Uh, sit down. Let's talk.

06:19.921 --> 06:22.548
Hank, your mother
means a great deal to me.

06:23.549 --> 06:26.052
It's been a long time
since I've had these feelings...

06:26.052 --> 06:29.389
Uh, uh, sorry, but now is a bad time.

06:29.389 --> 06:31.224
Uh, this is my program.

06:32.350 --> 06:33.893
And I just ask you, father,

06:33.893 --> 06:37.313
to take this man's hiccups, to heal him.

06:38.606 --> 06:39.857
Oh. Uh, I, I...

06:39.941 --> 06:41.818
y-you... believe in this stuff?

06:41.818 --> 06:44.320
Yep, that's right.
Uh, it's my favorite thing

06:44.404 --> 06:47.323
so please don't talk to me
about anything else right now.

06:47.407 --> 06:48.783
Hiccups, be gone!

06:50.118 --> 06:51.702
Well, I guess there's nothing we...

06:51.786 --> 06:52.787
Be gone!

06:54.122 --> 06:56.374
I was thinking of picking up a menorah

06:56.499 --> 06:58.876
so we can celebrate Hanukkah
and make Gary feel at home.

06:58.960 --> 06:59.877
What?

06:59.961 --> 07:02.588
I just think it'd be nice
to honor his traditions, too.

07:02.880 --> 07:06.342
Bobby could blow out all the candles
on Hanukkah eve and make a wish.

07:06.426 --> 07:08.010
No. he's the new guy.

07:08.094 --> 07:10.012
Why should we change anything for him?

07:10.096 --> 07:12.390
He hasn't made any offers
to change for me.

07:12.932 --> 07:14.725
Bobby, are you going to the game with us?

07:14.809 --> 07:17.395
Basketball I can take or leave.

07:17.395 --> 07:19.313
Excuse me? Honey, don't you mean to say

07:19.397 --> 07:21.190
I can take or leave basketball?

07:21.274 --> 07:23.276
No, Mom. Gary taught me this.

07:23.276 --> 07:26.070
It's the cool new way
people from Arizona talk.

07:26.154 --> 07:27.613
You want I should teach you?

07:27.697 --> 07:29.782
- Bobby, get your butt in the car.

07:29.866 --> 07:31.033
Let's go, let's go!

07:31.117 --> 07:34.662
If I miss the tip-off, I don't know
which team is going for which basket.

07:36.372 --> 07:37.415
Mom, you're not dressed.

07:37.415 --> 07:40.418
Didn't somebody tell you?
Four of Arlen's players made regionals.

07:40.418 --> 07:41.878
I think I'll pass.

07:41.878 --> 07:43.171
Fine. Whatever.

07:43.171 --> 07:45.298
I'm just saying an eighth grade like this

07:45.298 --> 07:46.966
comes along once in a decade.

07:51.471 --> 07:53.973
It's been a long night without you, puppy.

07:53.973 --> 07:58.227
Mister, it's certainly
been a long, hot night.

07:58.311 --> 07:59.896
I got your mistletoe

07:59.896 --> 08:01.981
right here.

08:03.858 --> 08:06.110
Did you remember
to bring the Styrofoam finger?

08:06.194 --> 08:08.529
- Yes, Hank.
- Does it say number one on it?

08:08.613 --> 08:10.740
- Yes, Hank.
- The basketball one?

08:24.170 --> 08:26.255
<i>Huh. That's my mother's robe.</i>

08:27.256 --> 08:28.674
<i>Soon as I'm out of sight,</i>

08:28.758 --> 08:30.092
<i>he makes her do the laundry.</i>

08:31.844 --> 08:35.932
<i>This is weird, sounds like the dryer's on,
but all their clothesare on the floor.</i>

09:06.087 --> 09:06.963
Huh?

09:08.047 --> 09:11.592
My eyes, uh, I, I've gone blind.

09:29.777 --> 09:31.070
Hank, is something wrong?

09:31.779 --> 09:32.947
You look very strange.

09:33.489 --> 09:36.617
Well, I guess I'll have
to take your word for it.

09:36.701 --> 09:38.119
I can't see a thing.

09:38.786 --> 09:40.037
I've gone blind.

09:40.121 --> 09:41.455
Oh, good Lord!

09:41.539 --> 09:43.457
Blind he's gone now.

09:44.959 --> 09:46.127
Yeah, I'm really stumped.

09:46.627 --> 09:48.713
Your eyes respond to light,
the retina is in place,

09:48.713 --> 09:50.089
and there's no sign of a stroke.

09:50.590 --> 09:53.593
Mr. Hill, I know I've asked you this,
but you didn't poke yourself, did you?

09:53.593 --> 09:56.429
No. I just went blind for no reason.

09:56.429 --> 09:58.806
Why is that so hard for you to understand?

09:58.806 --> 10:00.558
What kind of a doctor are you anyway?

10:00.683 --> 10:01.809
Will you do something?

10:01.809 --> 10:03.311
What are all these machines for?

10:03.311 --> 10:04.770
What about that laser right there?

10:04.854 --> 10:06.397
Use that laser on my husband right now.

10:06.397 --> 10:07.315
All right.

10:07.315 --> 10:09.191
Whoa, whoa, I don't need a laser.

10:09.692 --> 10:14.447
Look, what if somebody saw
something really, really wrong?

10:14.614 --> 10:16.157
Could that affect someone's vision?

10:16.157 --> 10:18.534
Was something out of place,
something where it shouldn't be?

10:18.618 --> 10:20.911
Did you open the microwave door
before the ding?

10:21.412 --> 10:23.080
Just tell me if it's possible.

10:23.164 --> 10:25.666
Well, there is a temporary disorder

10:25.750 --> 10:27.918
called hysterical blindness.

10:28.002 --> 10:31.005
Someone can see something
so horrific, like, uh

10:31.005 --> 10:32.798
say a brutal murder, that sort of thing

10:32.882 --> 10:34.759
that they actually lose their sight.

10:35.009 --> 10:36.302
I got a couple of books on it.

10:36.302 --> 10:38.179
Uh... here, you take them.
You might need them.

10:39.930 --> 10:42.725
This condition could last
a few days or a few weeks.

10:43.225 --> 10:46.812
The key to getting better will be
to confront what you saw and deal with it

10:47.188 --> 10:50.358
unless, of course, you poked yourself in
which case, when you're ready to admit it

10:50.358 --> 10:52.151
you can come back
and I'll fix you right up.

10:54.654 --> 10:55.488
Hank...

10:56.989 --> 10:59.075
when are you planning
on telling me what you saw?

10:59.700 --> 11:00.660
I can't say.

11:00.660 --> 11:02.870
You want me to lose my voice, too?

11:02.870 --> 11:05.790
How can I help you get better
if you don't tell me what cause this?

11:05.790 --> 11:07.041
So, don't help me.

11:07.041 --> 11:08.959
I'll just be blind. I don't care.

11:09.043 --> 11:11.879
Is it a thing or, or a person
or a vegetable?

11:11.879 --> 11:13.422
Wh... Hank, just tell me.

11:13.506 --> 11:15.257
A person.

11:15.341 --> 11:16.967
Stop it. Stop asking me.

11:17.051 --> 11:19.303
When we get home,
you can show me on a doll.

11:19.387 --> 11:20.262
No.

11:20.721 --> 11:22.640
All right, I'll tell you,

11:22.640 --> 11:25.309
but you can't say anything
about it to anyone.

11:25.810 --> 11:30.481
I saw mom and Gary, uh...
in the throes of, uh...

11:31.482 --> 11:32.441
activity.

11:32.525 --> 11:33.818
That's it?

11:34.527 --> 11:37.905
I can't believe you dragged me
to a medical doctor for that.

11:38.114 --> 11:40.741
Well, you get your sight back
right now, you big baby.

11:40.825 --> 11:42.952
Come on, Peggy, it's not that easy.

11:42.952 --> 11:45.413
How would you feel if you saw your mother

11:45.413 --> 11:48.916
on the kitchen table,
in the arms of a 65-year-old man

11:48.916 --> 11:51.752
wearing nothing but a submarine tattoo.

11:52.712 --> 11:55.131
I... eat breakfast on that table.

12:01.721 --> 12:03.389
What did the doctor say, honey?

12:03.389 --> 12:05.057
I poked myself in the eye.

12:05.141 --> 12:06.225
It's the darnedest thing.

12:06.225 --> 12:07.810
But what about the other eye?

12:07.810 --> 12:11.856
Well, it seems the other eye compensates
by shutting itself down.

12:12.314 --> 12:13.566
It's one of nature's wonders.

12:13.566 --> 12:16.318
My entire life I've been
reading psychology today.

12:16.861 --> 12:19.613
I, I never heard of an eye sympathetically
shutting down. Hmm.

12:19.697 --> 12:21.699
I've got a magazine you ought to read.

12:21.699 --> 12:23.492
It's called <i>The Ten Commandments.</i>

12:23.576 --> 12:24.618
Who's he talking to?

12:25.035 --> 12:26.912
Hank, you want I should come over there?

12:27.496 --> 12:29.123
"You want I should come over there"?

12:29.123 --> 12:31.292
That is so Arizona.

12:34.295 --> 12:36.255
I know what your problem is, Hank.

12:36.922 --> 12:38.299
Your finger's too big.

12:38.716 --> 12:40.551
That's why you poked your eye out.

12:42.553 --> 12:44.138
Ha-ha-ha-ha.

12:44.138 --> 12:46.891
Uh, hey, Hank, what am I thinking?

12:47.475 --> 12:48.601
You can't see.

12:50.311 --> 12:52.104
You can't see what I'm thinking.

12:52.605 --> 12:54.774
I'm not going
to be blind forever, you know.

12:54.774 --> 12:56.901
And the second I see some arse,
I'm kicking it.

12:56.901 --> 12:58.944
Now, no more making fun of my blindness.

12:59.028 --> 12:59.945
Okey-doke.

13:02.740 --> 13:04.074
Phone for you, Hank.

13:05.326 --> 13:07.161
The joke's on you, funny man.

13:09.872 --> 13:11.123
I like them flat.

13:11.207 --> 13:12.082
Press harder.

13:15.461 --> 13:16.629
- Peggy!

13:18.506 --> 13:20.090
- So. Okay...

13:20.174 --> 13:21.342
Who wants to make cookies?

13:34.772 --> 13:36.649
Jesus, if you're up there

13:36.649 --> 13:39.527
what I'd really like for Christmas is
my sight back...

13:40.277 --> 13:41.946
and a wrench set.

13:42.863 --> 13:45.199
Well, maybe I should be
talking to Santa about that.

13:57.253 --> 13:58.629
What? What's going on?

13:58.629 --> 14:00.172
Did somebody drop a dish?

14:00.256 --> 14:02.466
Okay, now we will open the presents.

14:02.550 --> 14:04.510
I'll pass them out like usual.

14:05.511 --> 14:07.471
Oh, we got something... square.

14:07.555 --> 14:11.517
Uh... Did somebody ask Santa
for something square?

14:12.560 --> 14:14.436
Uh... Here you go... Bobby.

14:17.565 --> 14:19.358
Hey, that's for me.

14:19.358 --> 14:20.651
He said, Bobby.

14:23.404 --> 14:25.698
Cool... A nightgown.

14:25.698 --> 14:27.324
I'm going to wear this when I get older.

14:27.408 --> 14:28.951
All right, who's next?

14:30.035 --> 14:31.620
Ooh, I got a heavy one here.

14:37.293 --> 14:41.297
Okay, and here's something
tor Peggy from Tilly and me.

14:42.590 --> 14:44.466
A book. I love b...

14:44.550 --> 14:46.760
<i>The clown did it:movie comics</i>

14:46.844 --> 14:48.596
<i>From Buster Keatonto Robin Williams.</i>

14:48.596 --> 14:49.805
Look, Hank!

14:49.889 --> 14:50.931
I'm awake.

14:51.599 --> 14:53.559
Oh, and what do we have here?

14:54.101 --> 14:57.229
Oh, my goodness,
another mink coat for Hank.

14:57.354 --> 14:59.481
- Sorry, Hank.

14:59.565 --> 15:00.733
I know that's getting old.

15:00.733 --> 15:02.735
That's great there, Gary.

15:02.735 --> 15:06.906
Thanks for turning my holiday
into a Woody Allen special.

15:06.906 --> 15:10.034
I'm going to sit in the truck
until it's time to go to my dad's.

15:10.034 --> 15:11.410
Where's my finger?

15:16.957 --> 15:18.542
- Gary, he didn't mean that.

15:18.626 --> 15:19.752
Please excuse me.

15:23.881 --> 15:24.882
Hank, stop.

15:25.591 --> 15:28.510
Hank, if you won't come back in
for Gary or your mother,

15:28.886 --> 15:30.471
at least do it for yourself.

15:30.471 --> 15:32.973
Now, the doctor told you
it was psychological.

15:33.057 --> 15:35.935
If you run away from your problem,
you will never get your sight back.

15:36.435 --> 15:38.896
Are you going to drive me
to my dad's or not?

15:43.651 --> 15:45.444
Honey, I feel better already.

15:45.444 --> 15:48.238
Every block we put
between me and the kitchen table

15:48.322 --> 15:49.531
is a load off my mind.

15:49.615 --> 15:50.783
Amen to that.

15:51.241 --> 15:52.618
Now, where am I going?

15:53.243 --> 15:54.703
- Huh? Wha...

15:54.787 --> 15:56.080
Peggy?

15:59.708 --> 16:02.044
Where's Peggy? Turn this thing around!

16:02.044 --> 16:04.171
Peggy asked me to take you.

16:04.171 --> 16:08.217
And my policy is give
a woman what she wants.

16:08.217 --> 16:09.510
Stop the truck!

16:09.510 --> 16:11.387
Let me ride in back, in the bed.

16:11.387 --> 16:14.264
Don't be silly.
You'll be much more comfortable inside.

16:14.348 --> 16:15.641
Here, I'll, um...

16:15.641 --> 16:17.309
I'll tell you what you're passing.

16:17.935 --> 16:19.520
There's one of those big trucks.

16:19.520 --> 16:21.271
You know, the ones you find on the road...

16:21.355 --> 16:22.731
a semi, a demi...

16:22.815 --> 16:24.650
a couple-of-dozen wheelers.

16:24.650 --> 16:26.527
Eh, here we got a billboard.

16:26.527 --> 16:28.070
They want us to buy some filing cab--

16:28.070 --> 16:30.698
Shut up! You're driving me insane!

16:30.698 --> 16:32.199
Oh, look! A hitchhiker!

16:32.199 --> 16:33.826
With a beard, a gun and a dog!

16:33.826 --> 16:35.244
I think we'll pick him up.

16:35.244 --> 16:37.371
It'll maybe take you out of this mood
you're in.

16:37.371 --> 16:38.497
He looks like a nice guy.

16:38.497 --> 16:39.456
No! No!

16:39.540 --> 16:41.166
But we can take the dog.

16:41.250 --> 16:43.502
No! He'll lick your face,
you'll feel better.

16:43.502 --> 16:44.420
No, no, no!

16:44.420 --> 16:45.421
Don't you like dogs?

16:53.554 --> 16:54.596
You're late!

16:54.680 --> 16:56.974
Dad, it's good to hear your voice.

16:56.974 --> 16:59.476
Still blind, huh? Or are you faking?

17:00.811 --> 17:03.564
- Either you're blind or you're slow.

17:03.564 --> 17:04.857
I'd believe both.

17:04.857 --> 17:05.983
What's he selling?

17:05.983 --> 17:07.192
Oh, uh...

17:07.276 --> 17:09.778
That's just the guy who drove me here.

17:09.862 --> 17:10.946
Gary Kasner.

17:11.030 --> 17:11.905
Kasner!

17:12.698 --> 17:13.949
Happy Hanukkah!

17:14.033 --> 17:16.118
I served with one of your tribe
in the pacific.

17:16.118 --> 17:18.120
Name of Brooklyn. You know him?

17:18.120 --> 17:20.414
I know a Joe Brookstein.

17:20.414 --> 17:21.665
That's him.

17:21.749 --> 17:23.375
Well, let's go get a tree, boy.

17:23.459 --> 17:25.210
Uh, Dad, I got to take

17:25.294 --> 17:26.587
- your shoulder here.

17:26.587 --> 17:27.755
Hands off, girlie!

17:27.755 --> 17:30.340
I didn't fight off a bunker
full of horny privates

17:30.424 --> 17:32.009
to let you cop a feel.

17:38.432 --> 17:40.309
You know, Dad, it's like old times

17:40.309 --> 17:41.935
being here on the holidays.

17:42.311 --> 17:43.812
I got to say, I really like seeing...

17:43.896 --> 17:45.731
You been a chauffeur
all your life, Kasner?

17:45.731 --> 17:47.274
I'm in visiting with Tilly.

17:47.274 --> 17:48.484
Just thought I'd help out.

17:48.484 --> 17:49.526
Tilly?

17:49.610 --> 17:50.819
My old Tilly?

17:50.903 --> 17:51.987
Uh, Dad...

17:52.071 --> 17:54.031
My sweet God!

17:54.031 --> 17:55.699
Is she still around?

17:55.783 --> 17:58.494
She was too old for me 20 years ago!

17:58.494 --> 18:00.996
I don't know what year
she told you she was, mister,

18:01.080 --> 18:03.832
but that odometer's done rolled over.

18:03.916 --> 18:05.417
Dad, it's Christmas!

18:05.501 --> 18:08.879
It doesn't matter what day it is.
You don't talk about her like that!

18:08.879 --> 18:10.214
Tilly's a great woman!

18:10.214 --> 18:11.507
A wonderful woman!

18:11.507 --> 18:13.383
And all you did was dump on her!

18:13.467 --> 18:14.468
Shame on you!

18:14.593 --> 18:18.388
If I catch you talking like that again,
I'll kick your arse!

18:18.472 --> 18:20.349
All right, I'm backing down!

18:21.016 --> 18:23.143
One man's trash is another man's treasure.

18:23.227 --> 18:25.604
Hank, I'll wait outside for you.

18:35.697 --> 18:38.075
Uh... A little to your left.

18:38.951 --> 18:40.035
Thanks, Gary.

18:40.119 --> 18:40.994
Huh.

18:41.578 --> 18:44.414
You, you didn't have to leave early
on my account.

18:44.498 --> 18:45.958
Where's my eggnog!

18:45.958 --> 18:47.918
Bring me my eggnog!!

18:47.918 --> 18:49.670
No problem.

18:53.632 --> 18:55.300
Where are we? We're not home yet.

18:57.094 --> 18:58.470
I'm taking you to a place

18:58.554 --> 19:00.681
that might help you
to get your sight back.

19:00.681 --> 19:02.850
I've already seen the doctors.

19:02.975 --> 19:04.726
No, no, not medicine.

19:04.810 --> 19:05.644
Faith.

19:06.270 --> 19:10.232
No, that's really nice of you to offer
to share your Jewishness with me,

19:10.232 --> 19:12.359
but I really don't walk that way.

19:12.359 --> 19:14.444
Hank, trust me.

19:15.612 --> 19:16.905
Look, it's nothing personal,

19:16.989 --> 19:21.869
I'm just not crazy about the idea
of my God seeing me in your God's temple.

19:21.869 --> 19:24.955
Hank, I wouldn't take you
to a temple without telling you.

19:24.955 --> 19:26.790
Then where are we? What's going on?

19:26.874 --> 19:29.459
I know you didn't poke yourself
in the eye.

19:29.543 --> 19:31.420
It's not hard to figure out what happened.

19:31.420 --> 19:34.548
You saw me and your mother in the kitchen.

19:35.465 --> 19:37.926
I'm not flattered
that it made you go blind,

19:38.010 --> 19:40.637
but obviously, it's something
psychological with you.

19:40.721 --> 19:42.097
That's why we're here.

19:42.181 --> 19:43.849
Welcome, brothers and sisters

19:43.849 --> 19:46.143
and all you prayer partners
tuning in at home.

19:46.143 --> 19:48.395
Welcome to the Canvas Cathedral.

19:48.395 --> 19:50.147
Canvas Cathedral?

19:50.147 --> 19:52.733
The big TV church on the highway?

19:52.733 --> 19:54.568
You said it was your favorite.

19:54.568 --> 19:56.111
You brought me here?

19:56.195 --> 19:58.697
We're celebrating
a special birthday today.

19:58.697 --> 20:00.073
Does anyone know his name?

20:00.699 --> 20:05.120
He's almost 2,000 years old,
but he's still going strong!

20:05.662 --> 20:08.123
I think we should give him
a round of applause

20:08.207 --> 20:10.709
because he's working on his birthday!

20:10.709 --> 20:13.128
I don't really believe
in this faith healing stuff,

20:13.253 --> 20:15.214
but it's a really nice gesture.

20:15.214 --> 20:17.507
I don't get it.
I haven't been that nice to you.

20:17.591 --> 20:19.259
Enough, enough.

20:19.343 --> 20:21.303
I do it because I love your mom.

20:21.303 --> 20:24.890
Well, she's very fond of you, too.

20:25.849 --> 20:29.186
And it's not such a bad thing
I'm beginning to think.

20:33.523 --> 20:36.026
Hey, hey, no fair.
I didn't see you coming.

20:36.902 --> 20:39.988
Okay... Got your jollies by now?

20:43.116 --> 20:45.577
He's healing the crippled today...

20:45.661 --> 20:46.954
on his birthday!

20:46.954 --> 20:49.373
He's healing the blind today.

20:49.373 --> 20:51.917
On his birthday.

20:51.917 --> 20:54.002
- I got a blind man right here.

20:54.336 --> 20:56.255
Is this man your son?

20:56.255 --> 20:59.091
I'd like to think... maybe one day.

20:59.591 --> 21:04.471
Yeah, well, I guess that would be
an all right way to be thinking.

21:12.646 --> 21:13.689
Blindness

21:13.689 --> 21:14.940
leave this man!

21:14.940 --> 21:16.108
I can see!

21:16.108 --> 21:18.110
That a boy! I knew you could!

21:18.110 --> 21:19.778
Amazing grace!

21:19.778 --> 21:21.905
He was blind, and now he sees!

21:21.989 --> 21:23.824
We'll be right back after these messages.

21:25.492 --> 21:26.660
Hey, Hank!

21:26.660 --> 21:27.995
How's the weather?

21:27.995 --> 21:30.330
Oh, right! You're blind!

21:31.373 --> 21:32.791
Oh, now me, now me.

21:32.791 --> 21:33.875
Hey, Hank.

21:33.959 --> 21:35.669
You're not wearing any pants.

21:37.546 --> 21:40.090
Man, Hank got that dang ol' stick, man.

21:40.090 --> 21:42.301
Even though walkin'
like he can see again, man.

21:42.301 --> 21:44.011
Hey, it's ol' spooky, man!

21:44.011 --> 21:46.471
Hey, Hank's got his sight, man. Run!
Get outta here!

21:56.565 --> 21:58.317
<i>Hey, you want to taste
something good?</i>

21:58.317 --> 22:00.569
Put the mashed potatoes
with the cranberries together.

22:00.569 --> 22:01.820
Mush them around.

22:06.408 --> 22:08.994
This is the best Christmas ever.

22:09.911 --> 22:10.787
Very good.

22:15.334 --> 22:16.793
<i>I shouldn't eat so much.</i>

22:16.877 --> 22:19.087
<i>So moist this turkey is.</i>

22:19.171 --> 22:22.090
<i>It's a special occasion,
you can have another piece.</i>

22:24.926 --> 22:27.262
<i>Look, I wonder
