00:01.418 --> 00:03.044
Previously
on When Calls the Heart...

00:03.044 --> 00:04.379
-Jack!
-Faith!

00:04.379 --> 00:05.255
[Jack] Is something wrong?

00:05.255 --> 00:06.381
It's personal.

00:06.381 --> 00:08.049
Garrisons deserve
to be locked away.

00:08.049 --> 00:09.718
My days as a Mountie
are over.

00:09.718 --> 00:10.803
What happened?

00:10.803 --> 00:12.053
Metal cable, it snapped.

00:12.053 --> 00:13.931
[Wade] Another axle broke
on a delivery wagon.

00:13.931 --> 00:16.016
First, Mr. Coulter gets hurt,
and now this?

00:17.977 --> 00:19.436
[Rosemary] I think you are
pushing yourself

00:19.436 --> 00:20.688
way too hard, Lee.

00:20.688 --> 00:21.981
There is no reason

00:21.981 --> 00:24.483
for you to hurry
back to work like this.

00:24.483 --> 00:26.443
You need time
to recover.

00:26.902 --> 00:28.529
Rosemary, I cut my foot.

00:28.529 --> 00:29.697
I don't have the plague.

00:30.071 --> 00:30.948
Well, that may be,

00:30.948 --> 00:33.033
but a person can never
be too careful.

00:33.033 --> 00:34.409
[sighing]

00:34.409 --> 00:35.703
This person

00:35.703 --> 00:37.078
has work to do.

00:37.078 --> 00:38.914
Lots of work to do.

00:38.914 --> 00:41.082
Just promise me
you will take it easy.

00:41.082 --> 00:42.209
I promise.

00:42.209 --> 00:43.794
I'll be back later
to check on you.

00:43.794 --> 00:44.837
Oh, I know you will.

00:44.837 --> 00:46.045
Don't work too hard.

00:46.045 --> 00:47.088
I won't.

00:47.088 --> 00:50.551
And try and stay
out of that draft.

00:50.551 --> 00:52.553
I keep telling you,
I'm not sick.

00:52.553 --> 00:54.680
Well, let's keep it that way,
then, shall we?

00:54.680 --> 00:55.806
Go, go, go...

00:57.683 --> 00:59.434
Oh, boy.

00:59.434 --> 01:00.644
Wade.

01:00.644 --> 01:02.103
Give me some good news, please.

01:02.103 --> 01:04.064
I wish I could.

01:04.064 --> 01:05.440
But we lost another contract.

01:05.440 --> 01:07.108
[sighs] That's the second one
in three days.

01:07.108 --> 01:08.819
We couldn't meet
the delivery schedule,

01:08.819 --> 01:10.529
not with three wagons
out of service.

01:10.529 --> 01:12.113
And one of the saws is down.

01:12.113 --> 01:13.114
How long to fix that?

01:13.114 --> 01:14.867
I got two guys on it now.

01:14.867 --> 01:16.159
Could take the rest of the week.

01:16.159 --> 01:17.661
All right, well,
let's get six guys on it,

01:17.661 --> 01:20.080
'cause we gotta dig ourselves
out of this hole we're in.

01:27.588 --> 01:28.839
[knock on door]

01:28.839 --> 01:29.882
Come in.

01:34.261 --> 01:36.137
Looks like
a snow storm in here.

01:36.137 --> 01:37.932
Jack, this is
so frustrating.

01:37.932 --> 01:39.934
I want to write
about Hope Valley.

01:39.934 --> 01:41.518
I want to share stories
about my life here

01:41.518 --> 01:42.770
with the rest of the world,

01:42.770 --> 01:45.981
but I can't seem to get past
the first line.

01:45.981 --> 01:48.067
Well, sometimes,
you have inspiration,

01:48.067 --> 01:49.150
and sometimes, you don't.

01:49.150 --> 01:50.736
I think mine's taken
a vacation.

01:50.736 --> 01:51.946
Well, it's back now.

01:51.946 --> 01:54.322
I ordered this
from the mercantile for you

01:54.322 --> 01:55.156
last week.

02:00.621 --> 02:01.455
May I?

02:08.003 --> 02:09.170
Jack...

02:09.170 --> 02:10.672
it's so wonderful!

02:13.174 --> 02:14.802
I know how much
these stories mean to you.

02:15.719 --> 02:16.971
Thank you so much.

02:17.930 --> 02:18.764
Try it out.

02:37.198 --> 02:39.367
[keys clacking sharply]

02:54.049 --> 02:56.510
[♪♪♪]

03:15.863 --> 03:17.238
All right, everyone,

03:17.238 --> 03:19.116
now, before we get started,

03:19.116 --> 03:22.243
I would like to introduce you
to Hattie Ferguson.

03:22.243 --> 03:24.245
She just moved
here from Hamilton.

03:24.245 --> 03:25.873
Isn't that where you come from?

03:25.873 --> 03:27.415
Yes, it is,
and it's very far away,

03:27.415 --> 03:29.001
so I want you all
to welcome Hattie

03:29.001 --> 03:30.251
and make her feel at home.

03:30.251 --> 03:31.920
[all together]
Hi, Hattie!

03:31.920 --> 03:33.047
That's very nice.

03:33.047 --> 03:34.173
All right, everyone,

03:34.173 --> 03:35.256
please take out
your arithmetic books

03:35.256 --> 03:36.424
and turn to page 10.

03:36.424 --> 03:38.093
Hattie, we're a little
short on books right now,

03:38.093 --> 03:39.260
but you can share
with Anna.

03:39.260 --> 03:41.471
We had our own books
at my school in Hamilton.

03:41.471 --> 03:44.099
And I will get you one
as soon as I can.

03:46.643 --> 03:49.270
I don't want to
sit next to her.

03:49.270 --> 03:50.814
Well, I've assigned you
your seat,

03:50.814 --> 03:51.857
so you need to take it.

03:55.235 --> 03:56.277
Today we'll be
reviewing

03:56.277 --> 03:58.613
our multiplication
tables...

03:58.613 --> 04:00.281
I really like your dress.

04:00.281 --> 04:03.243
Just because I'm sitting here
doesn't mean we're friends.

04:05.204 --> 04:08.082
I was thinking
chocolate cake.

04:08.082 --> 04:09.290
Please, Florence,

04:09.290 --> 04:10.500
there's really no need
to make such a fuss.

04:10.500 --> 04:12.293
Oh, you know me,
I like to fuss.

04:12.293 --> 04:13.712
Morning, ladies!

04:13.712 --> 04:15.214
Good morning.

04:15.214 --> 04:17.799
I hear someone has
a birthday coming up.

04:19.551 --> 04:21.261
I know this is
hard to believe,

04:21.261 --> 04:22.303
but I didn't
say a word.

04:22.303 --> 04:23.680
I swear it.

04:23.680 --> 04:25.306
So how did you know?

04:25.306 --> 04:27.809
Well, I am an investigator,

04:27.809 --> 04:29.853
and my investigation has led me
to the conclusion

04:29.853 --> 04:32.856
that someone may not have
any plans on her birthday.

04:32.856 --> 04:34.816
I didn't, but Florence
just invited me--

04:34.816 --> 04:35.901
--Out to lunch.

04:35.901 --> 04:37.360
She's completely
free for dinner.

04:37.360 --> 04:39.362
And I'm completely
behind

04:39.362 --> 04:40.572
on my shopping.

04:40.572 --> 04:41.615
I must go.

04:41.615 --> 04:43.075
Good day.

04:45.160 --> 04:46.828
So how does
a birthday dinner sound?

04:46.828 --> 04:48.038
Delightful.

04:48.038 --> 04:50.249
I know this great
little cafe

04:50.249 --> 04:51.332
and this amazing chef

04:51.332 --> 04:52.918
who only cooks
on special occasions.

04:52.918 --> 04:54.294
Oh? And who
would that be?

04:56.171 --> 04:57.338
What's your favorite dish?

04:58.924 --> 05:00.634
I like to be surprised.

05:00.634 --> 05:02.302
Well, I'm very good
at surprises.

05:03.428 --> 05:05.055
How's 7:00 on Thursday?

05:05.055 --> 05:06.014
I'll see you then.

05:13.855 --> 05:15.690
This is the last of it.

05:15.690 --> 05:17.609
I should have some apples
to send tomorrow,

05:17.609 --> 05:19.278
and I'll bake some bread.

05:19.278 --> 05:21.238
Well, you've been
more than generous.

05:21.238 --> 05:22.572
It's hard for those
settlers in the valley

05:22.572 --> 05:23.615
to move here

05:23.615 --> 05:24.825
and leave behind
everything they know.

05:25.533 --> 05:27.368
Sounds like you speak
from experience.

05:27.368 --> 05:30.831
Well, Noah and I came out west
looking for a better life,

05:30.831 --> 05:32.540
but it took a while to find it.

05:33.917 --> 05:36.377
I remember what it's like
to be hungry.

05:36.377 --> 05:38.588
So if there's anything
else I can do, let me know.

05:38.588 --> 05:40.757
Oh, you've done
more than you know, really.

05:40.757 --> 05:42.634
Well, I could say
the same about you.

05:42.634 --> 05:45.053
You've been there
every day for a week.

05:45.053 --> 05:47.430
The best part of my job
is being of service.

05:47.430 --> 05:49.474
What's the worst?

05:49.474 --> 05:52.519
Missing Sunday breakfast
at your cafe.

05:53.687 --> 05:57.065
Well, I could be convinced
to open early.

05:57.065 --> 05:59.400
No, no, you've got
too much work to do.

05:59.400 --> 06:02.196
Oh, cooking you breakfast
is not work.

06:04.281 --> 06:05.448
Well, I'd better get
out there.

06:05.448 --> 06:06.574
You know what?

06:06.574 --> 06:09.328
Clara can handle the lunch rush.

06:09.328 --> 06:10.329
I'm going with you.

06:10.329 --> 06:11.705
Hey, that's great.
I could use the help.

06:11.705 --> 06:12.747
Yes, it'll be
good for us.

06:12.747 --> 06:14.708
Like a new beginning

06:14.708 --> 06:16.126
after everything
that's happened.

06:16.126 --> 06:17.460
Yeah, I know
what you mean.

06:17.460 --> 06:19.087
But don't think this
gets you off the hook.

06:19.087 --> 06:21.089
I still want a rematch at darts.

06:21.089 --> 06:23.382
Oh, my, you are a glutton
for punishment, aren't you?

06:23.382 --> 06:24.551
[laughing]

06:26.011 --> 06:27.428
I'll see you outside.

06:27.428 --> 06:29.097
Yeah.

06:29.097 --> 06:30.307
[clears throat awkwardly]

06:30.307 --> 06:31.516
Taking the afternoon off?

06:31.516 --> 06:33.310
Yes, I'm going to help
with the settlers.

06:33.310 --> 06:34.435
But Clara's here.

06:34.435 --> 06:35.979
I'm sure she'll manage
just fine.

06:35.979 --> 06:37.564
Is there something you needed?

06:37.564 --> 06:38.606
Actually, there is.

06:38.606 --> 06:40.108
Um...

06:40.108 --> 06:43.862
I wanted your permission
to close the cafe an hour early

06:43.862 --> 06:45.239
on Thursday night.

06:45.239 --> 06:47.074
May I ask why?

06:47.074 --> 06:50.118
It's Dottie Ramsey's birthday
and I wanted to cook her dinner.

06:50.118 --> 06:52.453
That is a lovely idea.

06:52.453 --> 06:53.705
So it's all right with you?

06:53.705 --> 06:55.249
Yes, I think she'll love it.

06:55.249 --> 06:56.457
She's just a friend.

06:56.457 --> 06:58.043
Of course she is.

07:01.880 --> 07:03.298
So, there are some shortcuts

07:03.298 --> 07:04.632
in learning
the multiplication tables.

07:04.632 --> 07:06.425
Can anyone tell me
what those are?

07:08.345 --> 07:10.471
Miss Thatcher,
Miles stole my book.

07:10.471 --> 07:13.183
Miles, please give Emily
her book back.

07:14.642 --> 07:16.228
Is it time for recess?

07:16.228 --> 07:17.979
[sighs]

07:17.979 --> 07:19.273
A short recess.

07:19.273 --> 07:20.565
Ooh, it's my turn
with the kickball!

07:20.565 --> 07:22.483
No, it's not,
it's mine.

07:22.483 --> 07:23.818
Boys, please share.

07:23.818 --> 07:25.737
Do you want to play
hopscotch with us?

07:25.737 --> 07:26.863
I don't play hopscotch.

07:26.863 --> 07:28.282
My best friend,
Janie, and I,

07:28.282 --> 07:29.408
we play croquet.

07:29.408 --> 07:30.700
Hopscotch is fun.

07:30.700 --> 07:32.577
I said, I don't want to!

07:32.577 --> 07:34.121
Laura, what's going on here?

07:34.121 --> 07:35.205
We just asked her

07:35.205 --> 07:36.373
if she wanted
to play hopscotch with us.

07:36.373 --> 07:37.374
Hopscotch is dumb.

07:37.374 --> 07:38.417
Maybe you're dumb.

07:38.417 --> 07:40.168
All right, that's enough.

07:40.168 --> 07:41.628
Everyone back inside,

07:41.628 --> 07:43.463
everyone in your seats.

07:49.803 --> 07:51.638
Now, I am very
disappointed

07:51.638 --> 07:53.514
in how you all
treating each other today.

07:53.514 --> 07:55.225
She started it!

07:55.225 --> 07:57.436
It doesn't matter
who started it.

07:57.436 --> 07:58.519
What's important

07:58.519 --> 07:59.813
is that we all learn

07:59.813 --> 08:03.191
to treat each other
with kindness in this class.

08:03.191 --> 08:04.567
So...

08:04.567 --> 08:06.194
today will be

08:06.194 --> 08:09.781
the first day of...

08:09.781 --> 08:12.117
Kindness Week.

08:12.117 --> 08:13.327
What's Kindness Week?

08:15.162 --> 08:16.371
Well...

08:16.371 --> 08:18.415
every day this week,
for your homework,

08:18.415 --> 08:21.335
you're going to do
something kind for someone.

08:21.335 --> 08:22.461
It can't be someone
like your best friend.

08:22.461 --> 08:24.087
It needs to be
someone else.

08:24.087 --> 08:25.255
Like who?

08:25.255 --> 08:26.131
Someone you wouldn't
normally think of.

08:26.131 --> 08:27.090
And you get to pick.

08:27.090 --> 08:28.633
Do we have to?

08:28.633 --> 08:30.051
Yes, we have to--

08:30.051 --> 08:31.552
because we're a community,

08:31.552 --> 08:35.182
and it's time we start
acting like one.

08:37.267 --> 08:39.436
This couldn't have come
at a better time, Pastor.

08:39.436 --> 08:41.480
It's been tougher to find work
than we thought.

08:41.480 --> 08:42.981
Well, I hear the
railroad's hiring.

08:42.981 --> 08:44.983
They were, for a while.

08:44.983 --> 08:46.318
Not anymore.

08:46.318 --> 08:48.736
Couple people got jobs
at the sawmill,

08:48.736 --> 08:51.365
but it's still not
enough to go around.

08:51.365 --> 08:53.574
We'll do whatever
we can to help.

08:53.574 --> 08:55.369
Thank you.

08:55.369 --> 08:58.538
[baby crying]

09:01.582 --> 09:03.543
Is he all right?

09:03.543 --> 09:04.836
He won't stop crying.

09:04.836 --> 09:05.837
What's his name?

09:05.837 --> 09:07.172
Oliver.

09:07.172 --> 09:08.965
Hi, Oliver.

09:08.965 --> 09:11.134
[baby crying]

09:11.134 --> 09:12.052
How long has he had a fever?

09:12.052 --> 09:14.429
A couple days.

09:14.429 --> 09:15.596
There's a nurse in town
who could help.

09:15.596 --> 09:17.265
Oh, I couldn't afford a nurse.

09:17.265 --> 09:18.599
Oh, don't worry about that.

09:18.599 --> 09:19.726
No, you're part of
Hope Valley now.

09:19.726 --> 09:22.020
We take care of each other.

09:22.020 --> 09:24.647
There, there,
Oliver.

09:24.647 --> 09:25.815
It's okay...

09:28.609 --> 09:29.819
You wanted to talk to me?

09:29.819 --> 09:31.530
Yes.

09:31.530 --> 09:33.365
I'd spoken to Mayor Gowen,

09:33.365 --> 09:35.616
he said you turned down
the offer to run the infirmary.

09:35.616 --> 09:37.202
That's right.

09:37.202 --> 09:39.371
You don't like working
here in Hope Valley.

09:39.371 --> 09:40.747
No, I do.

09:40.747 --> 09:42.123
Can I ask why you said no?

09:42.123 --> 09:44.876
I got a wire from my fiancé.

09:44.876 --> 09:47.628
He told me I had to go back
to Union City right away.

09:47.628 --> 09:49.047
Is everything all right?

09:49.047 --> 09:50.798
Yes, everything's fine.

09:50.798 --> 09:53.385
I said I'd come as soon as
my work was done,

09:53.385 --> 09:54.635
that I wanted to help
set up the infirmary

09:54.635 --> 09:55.636
and get it up and running.

09:55.636 --> 09:57.597
But he had a problem with that.

09:57.597 --> 09:59.266
I guess so.

09:59.266 --> 10:01.601
He's coming here tomorrow
to take me home.

10:02.769 --> 10:04.438
Well, how do you feel about it?

10:04.438 --> 10:05.480
I don't know.

10:05.480 --> 10:07.190
I mean, I love Peter,

10:07.190 --> 10:08.649
and I want to make him happy,

10:08.649 --> 10:10.651
but being here

10:10.651 --> 10:12.529
and making a difference
in people's lives,

10:12.529 --> 10:14.655
it makes me feel so...

10:14.655 --> 10:17.700
alive.

10:17.700 --> 10:19.619
To tell you the truth,
I don't know what to do.

10:23.123 --> 10:24.082
[door opens]
I brought...

10:24.082 --> 10:25.166
dinner?

10:28.669 --> 10:30.838
I'm sorry,
I didn't mean to intrude--

10:30.838 --> 10:32.048
No, it's all right.

10:32.048 --> 10:33.467
I was just leaving.

10:33.467 --> 10:34.634
Oh--

10:34.634 --> 10:35.676
Faith...

10:35.676 --> 10:37.678
Talk to Peter about it.

10:37.678 --> 10:39.013
Tell him how you feel.

10:48.815 --> 10:52.944
I feel as though
I've interrupted something.

10:52.944 --> 10:55.863
She turned down the offer
to run the infirmary.

10:55.863 --> 10:58.533
It turns out her and her fiancé
are having some problems.

10:58.533 --> 11:00.701
And she came to you
to sort them out?

11:00.701 --> 11:01.702
Yeah.

11:01.702 --> 11:02.703
I'm her friend.

11:02.703 --> 11:03.704
I know.

11:03.704 --> 11:05.582
Doesn't mean I have to like it.

11:05.582 --> 11:06.707
Just for the record,

11:06.707 --> 11:08.543
I'm not sure how I feel
about Wade Barrett

11:08.543 --> 11:10.837
living right next door to you.

11:10.837 --> 11:12.464
Well...

11:12.464 --> 11:14.715
he is rather dashing.

11:14.715 --> 11:18.428
How am I ever
going to compete with that?

11:18.428 --> 11:20.763
Maybe you should try.

11:20.763 --> 11:22.432
Okay.

11:22.432 --> 11:24.476
After dinner,

11:24.476 --> 11:25.726
I am going to take you

11:25.726 --> 11:29.105
for a long, romantic walk
around the lake,

11:29.105 --> 11:30.649
just me and you.

11:30.649 --> 11:31.650
It's a bit chilly for a walk.

11:31.650 --> 11:33.026
Don't worry,
I'll keep you warm.

11:34.569 --> 11:35.903
How's that for competition?

11:35.903 --> 11:37.531
You win.

11:37.531 --> 11:39.698
[laughs]

11:42.910 --> 11:46.705
[crickets chirping,
dogs bark distantly]

11:46.705 --> 11:48.667
He's not crying
anymore.

11:48.667 --> 11:50.835
There you go.

11:50.835 --> 11:52.295
He has a mild
ear infection,

11:52.295 --> 11:53.754
but we caught it early.

11:53.754 --> 11:54.755
He should be just fine.

11:54.755 --> 11:57.008
Thanks to the two of you.

11:57.008 --> 11:58.259
But I would like someone
to bring you into town

11:58.259 --> 11:59.427
in the morning,

11:59.427 --> 12:01.596
just to be sure there are
no complications.

12:01.596 --> 12:03.390
I don't think
if I can impose again.

12:03.390 --> 12:06.184
It's not an imposition, Edith.

12:06.184 --> 12:08.562
I can't thank you enough
for all you've done.

12:08.562 --> 12:10.230
[door opens]

12:11.772 --> 12:13.732
You ready to go?

12:13.732 --> 12:15.734
See you tomorrow.

12:24.785 --> 12:26.705
Caleb surprised me
this morning

12:26.705 --> 12:27.788
by making my bed.

12:27.788 --> 12:29.874
It earned him an extra
cookie in his lunch.

12:29.874 --> 12:31.626
It is important
to teach the children

12:31.626 --> 12:32.711
to respect each other.

12:32.711 --> 12:33.794
It's about learning manners,

12:33.794 --> 12:35.004
if you ask me.

12:35.004 --> 12:36.172
It's so hard
to teach children

12:36.172 --> 12:37.798
to behave properly.

12:37.798 --> 12:38.799
You talk and talk,

12:38.799 --> 12:40.427
and it goes in one ear
and out the other.

12:40.427 --> 12:42.596
Well, I think I may have
a solution for you.

12:42.596 --> 12:44.097
When I was
your children's age,

12:44.097 --> 12:45.348
young ladies and gentlemen
learned good manners

12:45.348 --> 12:47.808
by attending a dance.

12:47.808 --> 12:48.809
That's an interesting idea...

12:48.809 --> 12:50.687
It was marvelous.

12:50.687 --> 12:52.063
Girls in their
very best dresses,

12:52.063 --> 12:53.814
and boys in their
Sunday suits,

12:53.814 --> 12:55.525
all so proper,
so elegant,

12:55.525 --> 12:56.817
and on their very
best behavior,

12:56.817 --> 12:59.654
treating each other
with respect and courtesy.

12:59.654 --> 13:01.740
I wish we could do
something like that here.

13:01.740 --> 13:02.907
We could,

13:02.907 --> 13:04.992
if Rosemary would organize it.

13:04.992 --> 13:08.246
Ooh, well...

13:08.246 --> 13:10.206
It is Kindness Week,

13:10.206 --> 13:11.832
and...

13:11.832 --> 13:14.419
well, I do have a talent for
putting together such things.

13:14.419 --> 13:15.836
No one does it better than you.

13:15.836 --> 13:18.298
Well, there'd have to be
a dance class,

13:18.298 --> 13:19.840
so the children could practice.

13:19.840 --> 13:21.384
They could stay
after school.

13:21.384 --> 13:22.343
And then there's
the formal dance.

13:22.343 --> 13:23.470
We'd need decorations,

13:23.470 --> 13:24.845
and of course, there
has to be refreshments.

13:24.845 --> 13:25.846
I'll bake brownies.

13:25.846 --> 13:27.474
I'll bring punch and cookies.

13:27.474 --> 13:28.516
[giggling]

13:28.516 --> 13:30.351
Well, this is amazing!

13:30.351 --> 13:32.061
Kindness is contagious
in Hope Valley.

13:32.061 --> 13:33.146
[laughs]

13:33.146 --> 13:34.481
Have a very nice day.

13:36.357 --> 13:37.692
Rumor has it

13:37.692 --> 13:39.860
that Lee Coulter's been
losing a lot of business.

13:39.860 --> 13:42.029
Yeah, he can't seem
to catch a break.

13:42.029 --> 13:43.864
Anything like this
ever happened before?

13:43.864 --> 13:45.199
No, it hasn't.

13:45.199 --> 13:46.242
Are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

13:46.242 --> 13:47.410
Something not
adding up, Jack.

13:47.410 --> 13:48.869
Right.

13:48.869 --> 13:50.997
Let's just hope it's
a string of bad luck.

13:50.997 --> 13:52.582
It'd better be.

13:52.582 --> 13:54.459
This town lives and dies
by that sawmill.

13:55.502 --> 13:56.628
Jack!

13:56.628 --> 13:58.797
I want you to meet
my fiancé.

13:58.797 --> 13:59.964
This is Peter Fillmore.

13:59.964 --> 14:01.800
-Peter, a pleasure.
-Constable.

14:01.800 --> 14:03.884
It's a nice little town
you have here.

14:03.884 --> 14:04.885
Well, we like it.

14:04.885 --> 14:06.513
And we appreciate
all of Faith's help.

14:06.513 --> 14:08.306
She's very good at
all that she does.

14:08.306 --> 14:09.390
We were hoping
she could stay

14:09.390 --> 14:11.476
until we found
a replacement for her.

14:11.476 --> 14:13.227
We need to get
back home, I'm afraid.

14:13.227 --> 14:15.062
If I just stayed
another week or two--

14:15.062 --> 14:16.690
Don't you have
a wedding to plan?

14:16.690 --> 14:17.856
I do--

14:17.856 --> 14:19.442
Then there's
nothing more to say.

14:19.442 --> 14:20.901
I can do both.

14:20.901 --> 14:22.028
Being my wife

14:22.028 --> 14:23.988
is going to be
a full-time job, my darling.

14:23.988 --> 14:25.072
You won't have to worry

14:25.072 --> 14:26.199
about playing little
Florence Nightingale

14:26.199 --> 14:27.908
ever again.

14:27.908 --> 14:29.744
Nice to meet you, Constable.

14:29.744 --> 14:31.830
You, too.

14:32.913 --> 14:35.333
Now, before I hear about
all of the kind things

14:35.333 --> 14:36.835
you've done for one another,

14:36.835 --> 14:39.462
Miss LeVeaux
has an announcement.

14:41.088 --> 14:43.007
Hello, children.

14:43.007 --> 14:45.760
Because it is Kindness Week,

14:45.760 --> 14:47.928
I have volunteered

14:47.928 --> 14:50.264
to do a selfless act of kindness
for all of you.

14:50.264 --> 14:51.516
We're not gonna do

14:51.516 --> 14:52.851
another play, are we?

14:52.851 --> 14:53.852
Robert...

14:56.062 --> 14:58.939
Perhaps
even better than a play.

14:58.939 --> 15:02.985
I am going to organize
a dance for all of you.

15:02.985 --> 15:05.238
With decorations,
and refreshments,

15:05.238 --> 15:06.947
and music!
[giggles]

15:06.947 --> 15:08.575
It's going to be simply...

15:08.575 --> 15:09.659
[gasps]

15:09.659 --> 15:10.744
magical.

15:10.744 --> 15:12.328
Now...

15:12.328 --> 15:13.413
We'll begin practicing
after school,

15:13.413 --> 15:15.164
and when I am done with you,

15:15.164 --> 15:17.166
you all will know how to behave

15:17.166 --> 15:20.961
like perfect little ladies
and gallant little gentlemen.

15:20.961 --> 15:22.630
[claps]
We'll see you after school.

15:25.132 --> 15:26.509
In Hamilton,

15:26.509 --> 15:28.219
my best friend, Janie, and I
went to cotillion

15:28.219 --> 15:29.637
all the time.

15:29.637 --> 15:31.305
You have to have
a live orchestra.

15:31.305 --> 15:33.349
Well, you don't need
a live orchestra

15:33.349 --> 15:34.934
in order to have
a wonderful time

15:34.934 --> 15:36.227
and make lots of new friends.

15:36.227 --> 15:38.229
It won't be the same.

15:38.229 --> 15:39.980
All right.

15:39.980 --> 15:42.108
Um, now, who has done
an act of kindness

15:42.108 --> 15:44.151
that they would like to share
with the class?

15:44.151 --> 15:46.571
I washed the dishes
for my mom.

15:46.571 --> 15:48.072
Very good, Opal.

15:48.072 --> 15:49.783
Anyone else?

15:49.783 --> 15:51.868
I rescued a skunk!

15:51.868 --> 15:52.993
You wanna see?

15:52.993 --> 15:57.290
[screaming in panic and disgust]

15:57.290 --> 15:58.999
How long did
the nurse say it'd take

15:58.999 --> 16:00.460
for your shoulder
to get better?

16:00.460 --> 16:03.337
Not too long,
a week or two maybe.

16:03.337 --> 16:05.005
Are you going back to
work at the Mercantile?

16:05.005 --> 16:06.883
I'm not sure yet.

16:06.883 --> 16:07.967
All I know is,

16:07.967 --> 16:09.218
I want to make
a lot more money,

16:09.218 --> 16:12.263
so I can buy my girl
lots of nice things.

16:12.263 --> 16:14.724
I'm not
your girl, Jesse.

16:14.724 --> 16:16.517
Not yet.

16:18.060 --> 16:20.980
[♪♪♪]

16:24.776 --> 16:28.028
I'm sorry you're sad
about the dance.

16:28.028 --> 16:30.030
Would you just leave me alone?

16:30.030 --> 16:33.409
Sometimes, when I'm sad,
Brownie cheers me up.

16:33.409 --> 16:34.702
You want to hold him?

16:34.702 --> 16:36.663
Just go away!

16:37.956 --> 16:39.332
[sniffling]

16:48.508 --> 16:49.926
Here you go, Opal.

16:49.926 --> 16:51.886
Why don't you take him inside
and clean him up, okay?

16:58.518 --> 16:59.936
Hattie Ferguson,
that was very rude.

16:59.936 --> 17:01.061
She wouldn't
leave me alone.

17:01.061 --> 17:02.897
She was just trying to be nice.

17:02.897 --> 17:03.982
I hate her.

17:03.982 --> 17:05.065
You don't mean that.

17:05.065 --> 17:07.777
Yes, I do.
I hate everyone here.

17:08.862 --> 17:10.530
You don't hate anyone,

17:10.530 --> 17:13.032
and you will stay after school
and wash the chalkboards.

17:22.792 --> 17:24.084
This is part of
the broken cable

17:24.084 --> 17:25.336
that cut your foot.

17:25.336 --> 17:28.673
Look at the edge.

17:28.673 --> 17:30.090
That didn't break
because of wear and tear.

17:30.090 --> 17:31.091
It was cut.

17:31.091 --> 17:33.887
So you're saying
this wasn't an accident?

17:33.887 --> 17:35.388
And I also took a look
at the axle that was broken

17:35.388 --> 17:37.264
on your delivery wagon.

17:37.264 --> 17:39.976
There were scratch marks
by the pinion head,

17:39.976 --> 17:42.102
like someone had taken a tool
to loosen the crown wheel.

17:42.102 --> 17:44.104
You don't think that was
an accident either?

17:44.104 --> 17:46.649
One suspicious incident
I'd say is hard luck,

17:46.649 --> 17:48.609
but two?

17:48.609 --> 17:50.862
No, sir,
something's not right here.

17:50.862 --> 17:53.740
Sabotage.

17:53.740 --> 17:55.157
Great.

17:57.117 --> 17:59.119
[Hattie]
I'm done with the chalkboard.

17:59.119 --> 18:00.120
Can I go now?

18:00.120 --> 18:01.915
Not yet.

18:01.915 --> 18:04.083
I would like
to talk to you.

18:08.128 --> 18:09.756
[sighs]

18:09.756 --> 18:13.676
Now, I know how hard it can be,
starting at a new school,

18:13.676 --> 18:15.177
but I think
it would be a lot easier

18:15.177 --> 18:16.470
if you tried to make
some friends.

18:16.470 --> 18:18.639
I don't want to make
any friends.

18:18.639 --> 18:20.140
I want to go back to Hamilton.

18:20.140 --> 18:21.475
Hattie...

18:21.475 --> 18:24.144
I felt just as you do
when I first got here.

18:24.144 --> 18:26.188
I didn't have any friends.

18:26.188 --> 18:27.774
But then I learned

18:27.774 --> 18:31.778
that the people here are kind,
and generous, and caring.

18:31.778 --> 18:33.821
You just need
to give them a chance,

18:33.821 --> 18:35.782
and before you know it,

18:35.782 --> 18:37.157
home will be right here,

18:37.157 --> 18:38.200
in Hope Valley.

18:38.200 --> 18:40.703
No, it won't.
Hamilton is my home,

18:40.703 --> 18:42.121
and Janie is my best friend.

18:43.163 --> 18:45.499
I have an idea.

18:45.499 --> 18:49.087
What if you wrote to Janie
and invited her to come visit?

18:49.087 --> 18:50.254
Then you could show her
your new school,

18:50.254 --> 18:52.172
and introduce her
to everyone.

18:52.172 --> 18:53.049
Wouldn't that
be nice?

18:53.049 --> 18:54.092
No.

18:54.092 --> 18:55.134
It won't.

18:55.134 --> 18:57.177
Because she'd hate it

18:57.177 --> 18:59.138
just as much as I hate it.

18:59.138 --> 19:00.139
Hattie...

19:13.611 --> 19:15.279
Oh! Penny
for your thoughts?

19:16.489 --> 19:19.117
Sorry, I guess I am
a little distracted.

19:19.117 --> 19:20.326
Now, Elizabeth.

19:20.326 --> 19:21.661
I know,
as a schoolteacher,

19:21.661 --> 19:23.203
you have a lot of things
on your mind,

19:23.203 --> 19:24.330
but well, that frown

19:24.330 --> 19:26.206
is only going to add
to the lines on your face,

19:26.206 --> 19:27.291
and I'm sure you don't want
any more of those

19:27.291 --> 19:28.334
than you already have.

19:28.334 --> 19:31.211
It's Kindness Week, remember?

19:31.211 --> 19:33.547
Kindness doesn't mean that
a person shouldn't be honest,

19:33.547 --> 19:36.425
and I'm here for you
if you need any advice.

19:36.425 --> 19:38.427
Actually,
I really could use some.

19:38.427 --> 19:39.428
[gasps in delight]

19:39.428 --> 19:41.889
I'm listening.

19:43.223 --> 19:45.392
I have this new
student at school,

19:45.392 --> 19:46.811
and she's having
a very hard time

19:46.811 --> 19:48.521
adjusting to living here.

19:48.521 --> 19:49.772
I've tried everything,

19:49.772 --> 19:51.315
but I just can't seem
to get through to her

19:51.315 --> 19:53.026
or help her make any friends.

19:53.026 --> 19:54.234
Hmm.

19:54.234 --> 19:55.235
Well, if you ask me--

19:55.235 --> 19:56.236
and you did--

19:56.236 --> 19:58.739
it's all about having her

19:58.739 --> 20:00.116
get to know
the other children.

20:00.116 --> 20:02.160
Finding out what
they have in common.

20:02.160 --> 20:04.244
Once you really
know someone,

20:04.244 --> 20:07.247
it makes it so much easier
to make a real connection.

20:07.247 --> 20:09.876
That makes a lot of sense.

20:09.876 --> 20:10.918
Well, of course it does.

20:10.918 --> 20:12.294
Look at you and me,
for example.

20:12.294 --> 20:14.172
Once I got to know you,
well, I realized,

20:14.172 --> 20:15.715
underneath your crusty exterior,

20:15.715 --> 20:18.509
there really was
a spark of personality.

20:18.509 --> 20:21.179
That makes me feel
so much better.

20:21.179 --> 20:22.346
You see?

20:22.346 --> 20:24.098
It works!

20:26.308 --> 20:27.727
[scoffs in amazement]

20:27.727 --> 20:30.771
I'm just so glad
his fever's gone.

20:30.771 --> 20:32.314
He should be fine,

20:32.314 --> 20:33.649
but if he does run
a temperature again,

20:33.649 --> 20:34.775
you'll have to have
Mrs. Stanton

20:34.775 --> 20:35.818
wire for a doctor.

20:35.818 --> 20:36.777
Won't you be here?

20:36.777 --> 20:38.278
No.

20:38.278 --> 20:40.781
I'll be on my way back home
to Union City tomorrow.

20:40.781 --> 20:42.366
You're an angel of mercy,
Miss Carter.

20:42.366 --> 20:43.993
That's true.

20:43.993 --> 20:45.119
We're going to miss you.

20:45.119 --> 20:48.039
I'll miss you all as well.

20:52.085 --> 20:53.711
Well, we should go.

20:53.711 --> 20:56.130
Edith, are you all right?

20:56.130 --> 20:58.632
You still seem like
you're worried.

20:58.632 --> 21:02.178
We found out Mr. Gowen
is raising the rent on our land.

21:02.178 --> 21:04.972
He says he'll evict us
if we don't pay.

21:04.972 --> 21:07.391
How much time has he given you
to come up with the extra rent?

21:07.391 --> 21:08.768
That's just it.

21:08.768 --> 21:09.852
He wants it by Monday.

21:09.852 --> 21:11.645
Well, that's no time at all.

21:11.645 --> 21:13.313
I honestly don't know
what we're going to do.

21:13.313 --> 21:14.815
We don't have anywhere to go,

21:14.815 --> 21:17.151
and there's no time
to make arrangements.

21:17.151 --> 21:18.318
I know Henry Gowen
personally.

21:18.318 --> 21:20.780
Let me talk to him.

21:31.124 --> 21:33.251
You sure you used
enough soap there, Cody?

21:33.251 --> 21:34.835
He was pretty dirty.

21:34.835 --> 21:36.420
Has he been chasing squirrels?

21:36.420 --> 21:38.505
The only thing Rip chases
these days is his food bowl.

21:38.505 --> 21:41.341
Why don't you
take him outside

21:41.341 --> 21:42.384
and rinse him off?

21:42.384 --> 21:43.636
I'll be sure to tell
Miss Thatcher

21:43.636 --> 21:45.304
that you've been
very kind to Rip.

21:56.523 --> 21:58.358
Peter...

21:58.358 --> 22:00.360
what can I do for you?

22:00.360 --> 22:02.780
I know how much
Faith respects you,

22:02.780 --> 22:04.490
so I wanted to talk to you.

22:04.490 --> 22:05.532
Of course.

22:05.532 --> 22:07.743
Please, have a seat.

22:07.743 --> 22:10.746
Now, what's on your mind?

22:10.746 --> 22:13.373
She's always been
a spirited woman,

22:13.373 --> 22:16.919
but I'm afraid lately
she's been overly...

22:16.919 --> 22:18.087
unreasonable.

22:18.087 --> 22:19.839
Unreasonable? How so?

22:19.839 --> 22:21.299
I've indulged
her desire to work

22:21.299 --> 22:22.716
as long as I could,

22:22.716 --> 22:24.051
but now it's time for us
to get married

22:24.051 --> 22:25.385
and start a family.

22:25.385 --> 22:26.846
And you want me to tell her
I think that's a good idea?

22:26.846 --> 22:27.847
From what I can tell,

22:27.847 --> 22:29.765
she respects your opinion,

22:29.765 --> 22:31.391
and sometimes, women need to be
told what to do.

22:31.391 --> 22:33.144
[chuckles]

22:33.144 --> 22:34.603
Actually, I think

22:34.603 --> 22:36.396
that if Faith wants to continue
being a nurse,

22:36.396 --> 22:37.815
she should have that choice.

22:37.815 --> 22:40.067
She's chosen to marry me.

22:40.067 --> 22:41.401
I don't see
why she can't do both.

22:41.401 --> 22:43.321
It just isn't possible.

22:43.321 --> 22:44.780
But I can see

22:44.780 --> 22:46.364
we don't see
eye to eye on this,

22:46.364 --> 22:48.326
so I won't waste
any more of your time.

22:48.326 --> 22:49.702
Peter...

22:53.122 --> 22:55.708
Are you sure
Faith is going to be happy

22:55.708 --> 22:57.417
giving up what she loves to do?

22:57.417 --> 23:00.129
I'm not sure she knows
what will make her happy.

23:00.129 --> 23:01.379
And you do?

23:02.715 --> 23:05.383
Of course I do.

23:10.430 --> 23:12.390
[squealing and playing]

23:13.559 --> 23:15.769
[♪♪♪]

23:19.606 --> 23:22.902
Are you sure you don't
want to play?

23:24.444 --> 23:25.863
[sighs heavily]

23:25.863 --> 23:27.447
You know,
you probably have

23:27.447 --> 23:28.532
more in common
with your classmates

23:28.532 --> 23:30.868
than you think.

23:32.912 --> 23:34.372
Take Cody, for instance.

23:34.372 --> 23:35.622
He's new, too,

23:35.622 --> 23:38.458
and he didn't have any friends
when he got here either.

23:38.458 --> 23:40.794
His best friend
was his sister, Becky.

23:40.794 --> 23:43.421
What happened to her?

23:43.421 --> 23:45.423
Oh. She got sick,

23:45.423 --> 23:48.426
so she's in Union City,
getting better now.

23:48.426 --> 23:51.471
But he misses her
very much,

23:51.471 --> 23:52.848
just like
you miss your friend.

23:52.848 --> 23:55.393
It's not the same.

23:55.393 --> 23:57.603
No.

23:57.603 --> 23:59.479
He wouldn't take the place
of your friend, Janie,

23:59.479 --> 24:00.522
and he didn't grow up

24:00.522 --> 24:03.567
in a big fancy house
in Hamilton,

24:03.567 --> 24:07.321
but he could really use
someone to look up to,

24:07.321 --> 24:10.074
someone to be
his big sister.

24:10.074 --> 24:12.076
It took him a while
to make friends, Hattie,

24:12.076 --> 24:13.369
but he did,

24:13.369 --> 24:16.789
and if you try,
and you're kind,

24:16.789 --> 24:18.749
you will, too.

24:32.721 --> 24:35.473
Look, I don't want to jump
to conclusions, fellas,

24:35.473 --> 24:37.935
but Jack and Bill
have been looking into

24:37.935 --> 24:40.187
the little accidents
we've been having

24:40.187 --> 24:41.147
around here lately,

24:41.147 --> 24:42.231
and they think

24:42.231 --> 24:44.317
that they might
be sabotage.

24:44.317 --> 24:45.651
Sabotage?

24:45.651 --> 24:47.278
How about you, Wade, you've
worked at a bunch of mills,

24:47.278 --> 24:48.737
you ever see anything
like this before?

24:48.737 --> 24:49.696
There hasn't been
a shop I've worked

24:49.696 --> 24:50.948
where men didn't
get hurt.

24:50.948 --> 24:52.532
Comes with
the territory.

24:52.532 --> 24:54.118
But it's pretty
coincidental

24:54.118 --> 24:56.662
the way all the wagons
broke down at once,

24:56.662 --> 24:57.704
and the saw as well.

24:57.704 --> 24:59.415
Yeah, Mike's
got a point.

24:59.415 --> 25:00.916
Just to be safe,
I'd double security.

25:00.916 --> 25:02.835
Good idea.

25:09.049 --> 25:10.050
[waltz plays]

25:10.050 --> 25:13.012
[♪♪♪]

25:13.012 --> 25:15.806
Now, as the music begins,

25:15.806 --> 25:17.224
the gentlemen
will cross the floor

25:17.224 --> 25:18.892
and ask for a lady's hand.

25:18.892 --> 25:20.518
[♪♪♪]

25:23.147 --> 25:24.606
Do I need to speak louder?

25:24.606 --> 25:26.650
You may need
to demonstrate.

25:26.650 --> 25:27.901
Oh, good idea.

25:27.901 --> 25:29.527
I'll need a volunteer.

25:31.489 --> 25:33.531
Here's one.

25:38.329 --> 25:40.622
[♪♪♪]

25:44.960 --> 25:47.587
"May I have..."

25:47.587 --> 25:50.508
May I have this dance?

25:55.179 --> 25:56.180
No.

25:57.348 --> 25:58.516
Excuse me?

25:58.516 --> 26:00.267
Did you just say "No?"

26:00.267 --> 26:02.478
I don't want to dance.

26:02.478 --> 26:04.188
Not with him,
not with anyone.

26:04.188 --> 26:05.189
[turns off music]

26:06.357 --> 26:07.565
Cody,

26:07.565 --> 26:08.859
I would love it

26:08.859 --> 26:09.902
if you would save
the first dance for me

26:09.902 --> 26:10.903
on Saturday.

26:14.948 --> 26:17.617
Hattie, that isn't the way
we behave at a dance,

26:17.617 --> 26:18.702
or anywhere else
for that matter.

26:18.702 --> 26:20.538
Just leave me alone.

26:20.538 --> 26:22.915
Listen to me...

26:22.915 --> 26:24.542
[quietly] If you keep
treating people badly,

26:24.542 --> 26:26.752
no one is going to want
to be your friend.

26:26.752 --> 26:29.004
Good.
Because I don't want any.

26:37.637 --> 26:39.639
Mr. Gowen?

26:39.639 --> 26:40.974
We need
to speak with you.

26:40.974 --> 26:42.768
Judging by your tone,

26:42.768 --> 26:45.354
I'm thinking I'm not going
to enjoy this conversation.

26:45.354 --> 26:46.855
Probably not.

26:46.855 --> 26:48.857
You can't raise the rent
on your settlement tenants

26:48.857 --> 26:50.276
on such short notice.

26:50.276 --> 26:52.152
Actually, I can.

26:52.152 --> 26:54.405
They're not on leases,
they're on handshake deals.

26:54.405 --> 26:55.655
Are you that heartless

26:55.655 --> 26:57.657
that you would force
those poor people out?

26:57.657 --> 27:00.244
Well, "Heart" doesn't come into
business decisions,

27:00.244 --> 27:01.661
Mrs. Stanton.

27:01.661 --> 27:03.456
If those people
can't afford their rent,

27:03.456 --> 27:05.665
then they've got to
make way for those who can,

27:05.665 --> 27:06.792
otherwise, I will evict them.

27:06.792 --> 27:07.876
No, you won't.

27:07.876 --> 27:09.795
Eviction is a legal process.

27:09.795 --> 27:11.671
Now, you may be
the mayor of Hope Valley,

27:11.671 --> 27:13.006
but you're not the law.

27:13.006 --> 27:15.008
I am.

27:15.008 --> 27:17.470
You show me a valid court order,
and I'll enforce it.

27:18.678 --> 27:20.431
[chuckles grimly]

27:24.851 --> 27:27.396
I know Hattie's been unhappy
since we moved here,

27:27.396 --> 27:28.939
but I didn't know
there were problems

27:28.939 --> 27:31.649
with the other children
at school.

27:31.649 --> 27:32.859
I'm so sorry.

27:32.859 --> 27:34.694
I think they'll be all right.

27:34.694 --> 27:37.197
It's really Hattie
I'm worried about.

27:37.197 --> 27:39.699
She doesn't seem to want
to make any friends.

27:39.699 --> 27:41.701
I know the move
was hard on her.

27:41.701 --> 27:43.036
She talks a lot

27:43.036 --> 27:45.705
about how much she misses
the beautiful house you had,

27:45.705 --> 27:46.706
and all the fancy parties,

27:46.706 --> 27:49.001
and dances.

27:49.001 --> 27:50.710
Did Hattie tell you we're rich?

27:50.710 --> 27:53.547
Not in so many words.

27:53.547 --> 27:56.716
It's true we lived
in a beautiful home,

27:56.716 --> 27:57.759
but it wasn't ours.

27:57.759 --> 27:58.969
It wasn't?

27:58.969 --> 28:01.138
I worked for
a judge's family.

28:01.138 --> 28:02.889
I was governess
to their daughter, Janie.

28:02.889 --> 28:04.724
Hattie's best friend.

28:04.724 --> 28:08.728
Those girls were like
two peas in a pod.

28:08.728 --> 28:11.023
But when my services
were no longer needed,

28:11.023 --> 28:13.275
we had to leave.

28:13.275 --> 28:15.068
I was thinking

28:15.068 --> 28:18.489
it might make Hattie feel better
if Janie could come for a visit.

28:18.489 --> 28:20.157
Miss Thatcher...

28:22.868 --> 28:24.161
Hattie hasn't told you.

28:24.161 --> 28:26.288
Told me what?

28:29.291 --> 28:31.043
Janie died.

28:38.551 --> 28:39.677
[laughing]

28:40.469 --> 28:43.013
I had no idea you could cook.

28:43.013 --> 28:45.974
Well, I am a man
of many talents.

28:45.974 --> 28:48.768
A toast...

28:48.768 --> 28:50.729
to a beautiful lady
on her special day.

28:55.942 --> 28:57.695
I am at a disadvantage.

28:57.695 --> 28:58.987
How's that?

28:58.987 --> 29:01.532
You have ways of getting
information that I don't.

29:01.532 --> 29:02.741
What kind of information

29:02.741 --> 29:04.493
are you interesting in
obtaining?

29:04.493 --> 29:06.203
First of all,

29:06.203 --> 29:10.207
I'd like to know why someone
as independent as you

29:10.207 --> 29:13.043
would ever become a Mountie
in the first place.

29:13.043 --> 29:14.878
There are a lot of bad people
who prey on good people,

29:14.878 --> 29:16.755
and not enough lawmen
to catch them.

29:17.797 --> 29:19.466
Then why did you leave?

29:19.466 --> 29:21.552
I learned that you can't always
solve a problem

29:21.552 --> 29:22.886
by taking a straight path.

29:24.304 --> 29:25.514
So...

29:25.514 --> 29:27.641
is that enough
information for you?

29:27.641 --> 29:28.808
For now.

29:28.808 --> 29:29.602
Good.

29:29.602 --> 29:30.477
If you'll excuse me,

29:30.477 --> 29:32.062
I have a couple of steaks

29:32.062 --> 29:33.105
that need seasoning.

29:34.064 --> 29:36.650
I've never had a man
cook for me before.

29:36.650 --> 29:39.152
Well, there's a first time
for a lot of things.

29:46.118 --> 29:47.786
I feel so bad for Hattie,

29:47.786 --> 29:49.246
pretending
she doesn't need anyone

29:49.246 --> 29:51.081
to cover up how much
she's hurting inside.

29:55.919 --> 29:57.045
You know, sometimes, I think

29:57.045 --> 29:59.339
you have the patience
of a saint.

29:59.339 --> 30:02.217
Children are like puzzles.

30:02.217 --> 30:04.010
Sometimes, you have to
work really hard

30:04.010 --> 30:06.597
to put the pieces together.

30:06.597 --> 30:07.847
But it's always worth it--

30:07.847 --> 30:09.933
especially for
someone like Hattie.

30:09.933 --> 30:11.935
The challenge now is
getting her past the pain,

30:11.935 --> 30:13.812
so she can open up again.

30:14.854 --> 30:18.024
I believe that you are going
to make a terrific mom one day.

30:19.568 --> 30:21.194
Because I like puzzles?

30:22.488 --> 30:23.530
Yeah.

30:23.530 --> 30:25.865
But most importantly,

30:25.865 --> 30:28.702
because you make
great shepherd's pie.

30:30.746 --> 30:32.748
[laughing]

30:32.748 --> 30:34.874
Okay.

30:34.874 --> 30:36.876
So...

30:36.876 --> 30:38.671
So?

30:38.671 --> 30:39.879
Isn't this where
you're supposed to tell me

30:39.879 --> 30:41.757
I'm going to make
a great dad one day?

30:42.882 --> 30:44.884
I don't know if that's true.

30:45.969 --> 30:47.471
You don't?

30:47.471 --> 30:50.474
I've never tried
your shepherd's pie.

30:51.767 --> 30:54.394
[laughing]

31:02.736 --> 31:04.904
Tell me something, Bill.

31:04.904 --> 31:06.281
It sounds like

31:06.281 --> 31:07.700
a lot of chapters
in your life

31:07.700 --> 31:09.702
are coming to an end.

31:09.702 --> 31:10.910
Meaning?

31:10.910 --> 31:14.873
Well, the Mounties,
and Nora...

31:14.873 --> 31:17.626
What about Abigail?

31:17.626 --> 31:19.503
We're business partners.

31:19.503 --> 31:21.755
I know, but
you said so yourself,

31:21.755 --> 31:23.882
you're a man who
doesn't like to take
a straight path

31:23.882 --> 31:24.924
to get what he wants,

31:24.924 --> 31:26.885
which,
some might say,

31:26.885 --> 31:29.179
makes you
a bit dangerous.

31:29.179 --> 31:31.557
Unpredictable, maybe,
but not dangerous.

31:31.557 --> 31:33.933
Even when it comes
to matters of the heart?

31:41.941 --> 31:43.443
You decide.

31:49.783 --> 31:51.410
[♪♪♪]

31:52.661 --> 31:53.620
Why aren't
the boys here?

31:53.620 --> 31:54.496
Are we in trouble?

31:54.496 --> 31:55.997
No, you're not in trouble,

31:55.997 --> 31:59.084
and the boys aren't here because
this is a special meeting

31:59.084 --> 32:00.460
just for the girls.

32:00.460 --> 32:01.879
So I asked your parents
to bring you here

32:01.879 --> 32:03.630
because I wanted to
talk to you in private,

32:03.630 --> 32:04.464
about Hattie.

32:04.464 --> 32:05.841
She hates us.

32:05.841 --> 32:08.594
Actually, I think
she's jealous of you.

32:08.594 --> 32:09.969
You all have each other.

32:09.969 --> 32:11.555
You've made friends here.

32:11.555 --> 32:13.432
But Hattie is new,
and she doesn't have anyone.

32:13.432 --> 32:14.933
That's because she's mean.

32:15.975 --> 32:18.687
I know this may be hard
for you to understand,

32:18.687 --> 32:21.189
but Hattie lost a friend
she was very close to,

32:21.189 --> 32:23.983
and now she's not sure
she can trust anyone

32:23.983 --> 32:24.984
to be her friend anymore.

32:24.984 --> 32:26.986
Who here has lost
something close to them?

32:26.986 --> 32:29.698
I had a dog
that ran away.

32:29.698 --> 32:31.491
I cried
for a long time.

32:31.491 --> 32:33.493
I thought
I lost Brownie once.

32:33.493 --> 32:34.994
It made me really sad.

32:34.994 --> 32:37.372
If you can just remember
that feeling,

32:37.372 --> 32:39.374
then you know
what Hattie must be feeling now.

32:39.374 --> 32:40.959
Maybe there's a way
to make her feel better.

32:41.627 --> 32:43.962
I was hoping you'd say that...

32:45.464 --> 32:46.715
Peter's not backing down.

32:46.715 --> 32:48.926
He says I have to go back
to Union City with him,

32:48.926 --> 32:51.136
or our engagement's off.

32:51.136 --> 32:52.387
How do you feel about that?

32:52.387 --> 32:54.180
I mean, I love Peter,
of course,

32:54.180 --> 32:56.015
but I don't think
he's being fair.

32:56.015 --> 32:57.559
Peter wants what he wants.

32:57.559 --> 32:59.144
What if it's not what I want?

32:59.144 --> 33:00.979
Wouldn't you rather
know that now

33:00.979 --> 33:02.564
than find out later?

33:04.065 --> 33:07.026
I guess we should have
talked these things over

33:07.026 --> 33:08.487
before we got engaged.

33:08.487 --> 33:10.155
Well, it's better late
than never.

33:10.155 --> 33:12.282
But I made
a promise to him, Jack,

33:12.282 --> 33:13.992
and a promise is a promise.

33:13.992 --> 33:15.452
Not if that promise

33:15.452 --> 33:17.746
is going to make you unhappy
for the rest of your life.

33:19.873 --> 33:22.000
I thought love was
supposed to conquer all.

33:23.042 --> 33:25.044
It does.

33:25.044 --> 33:26.129
If it's really love.

33:35.054 --> 33:37.056
Why are we here?

33:37.056 --> 33:38.976
It's a surprise.

33:38.976 --> 33:40.018
I don't like surprises.

33:41.603 --> 33:43.271
All right.

33:43.271 --> 33:46.316
Some of the girls from school
have gotten together

33:46.316 --> 33:48.067
to make a little
welcome party for you.

33:48.067 --> 33:50.111
They're waiting for you
in the parlor.

33:50.111 --> 33:51.279
I'm not going.

33:51.279 --> 33:52.322
Hattie, please?

33:52.322 --> 33:53.657
They're trying so hard,

33:53.657 --> 33:55.074
and they just want to be
your friend.

33:55.074 --> 33:56.743
I have Janie.

33:56.743 --> 33:58.119
She's the only friend I need.

33:58.119 --> 34:00.079
Hattie...

34:00.079 --> 34:01.331
Please sit down.

34:10.924 --> 34:13.844
Hattie, I talked
to your mother,

34:13.844 --> 34:16.179
and I know about what
happened to Janie.

34:16.179 --> 34:18.849
I'm so sorry.

34:18.849 --> 34:21.393
Janie's my best friend.

34:21.393 --> 34:24.103
She'll always be
my best friend.

34:24.103 --> 34:26.105
I know.

34:26.105 --> 34:30.652
And you'll never forget
how special she was.

34:30.652 --> 34:31.653
But that doesn't mean

34:31.653 --> 34:34.113
you shouldn't have
other friends.

34:34.113 --> 34:37.409
But what if something
were to happen to them?

34:37.409 --> 34:40.495
Oh, honey, you can't be afraid
to open your heart up again.

34:42.121 --> 34:43.122
I know it hurts,

34:43.122 --> 34:47.044
and it's going hurt
for a very long time.

34:49.004 --> 34:52.758
But Janie would want you
to make new friends.

34:52.758 --> 34:54.551
She wouldn't want you to be sad.

34:54.551 --> 34:57.888
That's not what being
a best friend is all about.

34:59.097 --> 35:01.516
I miss her so much.

35:01.516 --> 35:02.726
I know you do.

35:02.726 --> 35:04.895
But you're going to
have to let go of her,

35:04.895 --> 35:06.521
just a little bit.

35:06.521 --> 35:09.357
It's too late.

35:09.357 --> 35:10.734
I've been so mean,

35:10.734 --> 35:13.737
nobody will ever
want to be my friend.

35:14.112 --> 35:15.154
Hattie,

35:15.154 --> 35:19.826
we treat people with
kindness here, remember?

35:19.826 --> 35:22.662
And we believe in
second chances.

35:22.662 --> 35:25.123
Even for someone like me?

35:27.166 --> 35:29.252
Especially for
someone like you.

35:33.298 --> 35:35.675
Now, are you ready
to go see the other girls?

35:53.192 --> 35:55.779
Surprise!

36:07.499 --> 36:11.086
So, one of my men
thought he smelled smoke,

36:11.086 --> 36:12.170
and that's
when he saw

36:12.170 --> 36:15.214
the revolving
steam feeder on fire.

36:15.214 --> 36:17.926
Too many accidents
for them all to be accidents.

36:17.926 --> 36:20.012
I think someone's trying
to put you out of business, Lee.

36:20.012 --> 36:21.429
So, arson, huh?

36:21.429 --> 36:22.472
Seems like it to me.

36:22.472 --> 36:24.557
Should I be filing
a police report, then?

36:24.557 --> 36:26.225
We don't even have
a suspect yet.

36:26.225 --> 36:28.103
Once we open
an official investigation,

36:28.103 --> 36:30.271
we risk tipping off
the inside man.

36:30.271 --> 36:34.151
Now, I don't know about you,
but I want to catch him first,

36:34.151 --> 36:35.944
so let's keep
this quiet.

36:37.445 --> 36:38.822
All right.

36:44.327 --> 36:46.412
It'll be good to get home.

36:46.412 --> 36:48.289
Peter...

36:48.289 --> 36:50.249
I'm not going with you.

36:50.249 --> 36:53.252
You're... not going?

36:53.252 --> 36:54.963
Not right now,
at least.

36:54.963 --> 36:55.839
They need me here.

36:55.839 --> 36:56.882
I can't leave.

36:58.008 --> 36:59.176
You don't know
what you're saying.

36:59.176 --> 37:00.343
Actually, I do.

37:02.261 --> 37:04.222
If you don't get on this coach,
our engagement is over.

37:05.057 --> 37:06.058
If that's the way you feel,

37:06.058 --> 37:07.767
then that's your decision,
not mine.

37:10.603 --> 37:12.230
You'll regret this.

37:12.230 --> 37:13.857
Maybe.

37:13.857 --> 37:16.234
But I have to find out
for myself.

good job with it.

38:33.145 --> 38:34.938
Thank you.

38:34.938 --> 38:36.148
Miss LeVeaux?

38:36.148 --> 38:37.190
Hello? [gasps]

38:37.190 --> 38:38.357
Don't you look pretty

38:38.357 --> 38:39.818
in your lovely dress.

38:39.818 --> 38:42.237
Since it's Kindness Week,
I made you something special.

38:42.237 --> 38:42.988
You did?

38:42.988 --> 38:44.030
It's a necklace.

38:44.030 --> 38:45.364
I made it out of macaroni.

38:45.364 --> 38:47.159
That's...

38:47.159 --> 38:48.326
very unique.

38:49.368 --> 38:51.496
I will treasure it.

38:51.496 --> 38:53.372
Aren't you going to put it on?

38:53.372 --> 38:56.501
Of course she is.

39:02.007 --> 39:03.758
Well, I'll be
the belle of the ball.

39:03.758 --> 39:06.427
[chuckling]]
I think it's very sweet.

39:06.427 --> 39:07.720
And the children
may not show it,

39:07.720 --> 39:09.973
but I think they're really
excited about tonight.

39:09.973 --> 39:11.390
Oh, I hope so.

39:11.390 --> 39:12.350
I know so,

39:12.350 --> 39:13.559
that's why I'm telling you.

39:13.559 --> 39:15.061
Your act of kindness?

39:15.061 --> 39:16.646
Mm-hmm.

39:16.646 --> 39:19.524
Rosemary, we may not always
have been the best of friends,

39:19.524 --> 39:21.109
but I think that what
you're doing for the children

39:21.109 --> 39:22.360
is really amazing.

39:23.528 --> 39:24.737
That's...

39:24.737 --> 39:26.072
so sweet of you,

39:26.072 --> 39:27.740
really.

39:27.740 --> 39:29.408
[chuckles awkwardly]
I don't know what to say.

39:29.408 --> 39:31.369
You don't have to say anything.

39:31.369 --> 39:32.829
Perhaps I could
return the compliment

39:32.829 --> 39:34.372
with a macaroni necklace?

39:34.372 --> 39:35.456
Oh, no,

39:35.456 --> 39:37.416
that's much too generous.

39:37.416 --> 39:40.920
Oh, girls,
don't you look exquisite.

39:40.920 --> 39:42.630
I lent Anna one of
my party dresses

39:42.630 --> 39:43.715
for Kindness Week.

39:43.715 --> 39:45.258
That's wonderful.

39:45.258 --> 39:47.344
-Bye.
-Bye!

39:47.969 --> 39:48.803
Elizabeth Thatcher,

39:48.803 --> 39:50.096
I don't know
how you did it,

39:50.096 --> 39:53.432
but you worked a miracle
with that little girl.

39:53.432 --> 39:55.352
She did
the hard work herself.

39:55.352 --> 39:57.187
What happened?

39:57.187 --> 39:59.564
She opened her heart.

40:05.320 --> 40:08.698
Well, I think we should
all get started.

40:15.247 --> 40:17.082
[waltz music plays]

40:19.458 --> 40:21.419
[♪♪♪]

40:32.471 --> 40:34.099
May I have this dance?

40:34.099 --> 40:36.684
I would be delighted.

40:36.684 --> 40:37.977
[chuckles fondly]

40:40.688 --> 40:43.733
I was hoping you would save
the first dance for me.

40:43.733 --> 40:46.778
You want to dance with me?

40:46.778 --> 40:48.905
If that's okay
with Miss Thatcher.

40:48.905 --> 40:51.532
It's more than okay.

40:57.038 --> 40:58.164
[sighs happily]

40:59.498 --> 41:01.793
Well, it looks like
you've been stood up.

41:01.793 --> 41:02.835
Hmm.

41:02.835 --> 41:04.963
I have.

41:04.963 --> 41:08.507
I know they're
big shoes to fill...

41:08.507 --> 41:10.969
but may I?

41:10.969 --> 41:13.138
Of course.

41:13.138 --> 41:15.473
[♪♪♪]
