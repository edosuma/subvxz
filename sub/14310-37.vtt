00:05.089 --> 00:08.109
(male narrator)
Long, long ago,
deep in the forest

00:08.130 --> 00:12.070
there was a hidden village
where tiny creatures lived.

00:12.089 --> 00:15.000
They call themselves Smurfs.

00:15.019 --> 00:16.230
They were good.

00:17.010 --> 00:19.190
[theme music]

00:22.120 --> 00:26.059
Then, there was Gargamel,
the evil wizard.

00:26.079 --> 00:27.219
He was bad.

00:28.000 --> 00:31.070
Oh, I hate smurfs.

00:31.089 --> 00:32.170
I'll get you.

00:32.189 --> 00:36.109
I'll get all of you, if it's
the last thing I ever do!

00:36.130 --> 00:38.039
[laughing]

00:38.060 --> 00:39.119
[grunts]

00:39.140 --> 00:41.100
(Gargamel)
Oh, I'll get you.

00:41.119 --> 00:44.189
I'll find your village someday.
You'll be sorry!

00:44.210 --> 00:47.030
(male narrator)
Well, the forest is still there

00:47.049 --> 00:51.060
and if you listen,
you may hear Gargamel's rage.

00:51.079 --> 00:53.149
And if you are good,
you may just

00:53.170 --> 00:56.189
catch a glimpse of the Smurfs.

00:59.210 --> 01:02.100
[instrumental music]

01:09.060 --> 01:11.230
My perfect Smurf-catcher.

01:12.010 --> 01:14.109
Now to try it out.

01:14.129 --> 01:17.010
[yawning]

01:22.120 --> 01:24.170
'Ah-ha! It works.'

01:24.189 --> 01:27.189

potion works.

[yowling]

01:40.060 --> 01:42.150
[sighing]

01:42.170 --> 01:47.009
Hmm. A bit too strong,
but this should fix it.

01:47.030 --> 01:51.009
After all, there's nothing worse
than Smurfs who are overdone.

01:51.030 --> 01:53.180
[laughing]

01:53.200 --> 01:55.020

[creature squeaks]

02:36.150 --> 02:38.030
Just a smurf, Clumsy.

02:38.050 --> 02:39.210
What's that on your log?

02:39.229 --> 02:42.009
- Uh-uh, eh, where?
- Oof!

02:42.030 --> 02:43.110
[squeaks]

02:43.129 --> 02:47.129
Oh, there. Ha-ha.
Hey, you're a cute little fella.

02:47.150 --> 02:49.060
[squeaking]

02:49.079 --> 02:52.069
Ha-ha-ha!
It likes me. Ha-ha!

02:52.090 --> 02:54.219
It's obviously a poor judge
of character.

02:55.000 --> 02:57.000
Hey, what you got
there, Clumsy?

02:57.020 --> 02:59.060
Uh, gee, uh, I don't know.

02:59.079 --> 03:00.099
Can I hold it?

03:00.120 --> 03:02.139
Papa Smurf should see it first.

03:02.159 --> 03:04.189
Papa Smurf should always be..

03:04.210 --> 03:06.229
slurp slurp

03:07.009 --> 03:08.169
[squeaking]

03:11.229 --> 03:14.150
Look what I found, Papa Smurf.
Can I keep him?

03:14.169 --> 03:15.219
[squeaks]

03:16.000 --> 03:19.129
A fuzzle. No, Clumsy.
Absosmurfly not.

03:19.150 --> 03:21.159
Now put it back
where you found it.

03:21.180 --> 03:24.050
See? I told you Papa Smurf
should see it first.

03:24.069 --> 03:27.000
But, oh, no, you wouldn't..

03:27.020 --> 03:28.210
[squeaking]

03:29.000 --> 03:31.170
Oh, but, Papa Smurf,
he's so little.

03:31.189 --> 03:35.000
Little fuzzles are big trouble.
Put it back!

03:35.020 --> 03:36.159
Yes, Papa Smurf.

03:36.180 --> 03:39.069
Alright, Smurfs,
load up the logs.

03:39.090 --> 03:41.099
We're heading home.

03:41.120 --> 03:45.229
[sighs]
Sorry, little fuzzle.
Guess this is goodbye.

04:05.189 --> 04:06.189
Shh, shh, shh.

04:06.210 --> 04:08.030
You gotta keep your smurf shut

04:08.050 --> 04:09.169
or this'll never work.

04:09.189 --> 04:11.080
[fuzzle squeaks]

[Azrael laughs]

04:26.050 --> 04:28.230
Where could that little
wretch have gone?

04:30.110 --> 04:32.050
Ah-ha.

04:32.220 --> 04:34.079
Ah-ha.

04:34.100 --> 04:37.159
Come down from there,
you little blue tree toad.

'We're still in business.'

05:02.149 --> 05:04.160
[Gargamel laughs]

05:04.180 --> 05:06.009
Head straight for the dam

05:06.029 --> 05:08.100
and we'll get started
on the reapirs.

05:16.160 --> 05:19.149
Well, little fuzzle,
I bet you're hungry.

05:19.170 --> 05:21.120
[squeaking]

05:22.230 --> 05:24.050

05:24.069 --> 05:26.060

Yoo-hoo! Little fuzzle!
I'm home.

Uh-oh. Brainy!

06:31.139 --> 06:34.170
Uh, uh, Brainy,
I've got problems.

06:34.189 --> 06:36.230
Sorry, Clumsy,
but it's lunchtime.

06:37.009 --> 06:39.060
And lunchtime
is not for problems

06:39.079 --> 06:40.220
it's for eating.

06:41.000 --> 06:43.230
See? Like they're doing. So..

06:44.009 --> 06:46.040
Yipe! My house.

fuzzles come from?'

Uh, my house.

06:53.009 --> 06:56.019
(Brainy Smurf)
Papa Smurf was right.
Fuzzles mean big trouble.

06:56.040 --> 06:57.129
And he'll really be smurfed

06:57.149 --> 07:00.089
when he finds out
you disobeyed him, Clumsy.

07:00.110 --> 07:03.139
Uh, he sure will.
Uh, what'll I do?

07:03.160 --> 07:06.160
I don't know, but you'd better
do it fast. Look.

'Yikes, ahh! Papa Smurf's lab.'

07:09.060 --> 07:11.139
Uh, oh, oh.
Uh, hi, Papa Smurf.

07:11.160 --> 07:13.120
Something wrong, Clumsy?

07:13.139 --> 07:17.220
Wrong? Ha-ha.
Well, no, I, uh, uh, just..

07:18.000 --> 07:19.199
More soup, Papa Smurf?

07:23.009 --> 07:25.000
Or maybe some dessert?

07:25.019 --> 07:26.160
[fuzzles chirp]

07:26.180 --> 07:29.029
Uh, uh, better yet, Papa,
uh, there's nothing like

07:29.050 --> 07:31.019
a brisk walk after lunch.

07:31.040 --> 07:33.079
But I haven't eaten lunch yet.

07:33.100 --> 07:35.090
Now, what's going on here,
Clumsy?

07:36.180 --> 07:38.040

07:38.060 --> 07:42.129
Fuzzles. Clumsy! I warned you
fuzzles were trouble.

07:42.149 --> 07:46.090
Uh, I know, Papa Smurf,
and I'm sure sorry.

07:46.110 --> 07:47.159

07:51.069 --> 07:52.220
They're destroying my lab.

07:53.000 --> 07:55.149
Round up every last fuzzle
and take them all back

07:55.170 --> 07:57.050
to the forest, now.

07:57.069 --> 07:58.159
Ye-yes, Papa Smurf.

07:58.180 --> 08:01.209
We're getting closer, Azrael.
I can feel it.

08:01.230 --> 08:03.209
There. What did I tell you?

08:03.230 --> 08:05.029
'Smurfs were here.'

08:05.050 --> 08:07.069
'The sawdust is still fresh.'

08:24.000 --> 08:25.120
Oh, no.

08:25.139 --> 08:27.050
Smurfette, the way
to get rid of them

08:27.069 --> 08:28.220
is to scare them away.

08:29.000 --> 08:30.019
Watch.

08:30.040 --> 08:33.029
Here, fuzzles.
A present for you.

of them, Brainy.

08:55.149 --> 08:57.009
It's about time.

08:57.029 --> 08:59.179
Let's smurf them out of here
like Papa Smurf said.

Papa Smurf! Papa Smurf! Quick!

09:10.090 --> 09:12.070
The fuzzles are heading
for the dam.

What?

09:13.139 --> 09:16.000
[Smurfs clamoring]

09:17.009 --> 09:19.000
Make way for Papa Smurf.

Hooray for Papa! He..

09:40.210 --> 09:42.009
Shh!

09:42.029 --> 09:44.169
Quickly. Gather all the fuzzles
before they wake up.

Mm, these little critters
have the...right idea.

they're waking up.

[fuzzles squeaking]

10:06.059 --> 10:08.059
That's all
of my sleeping potion.

10:08.080 --> 10:11.070
And there isn't time
to smurf up another batch.

10:11.090 --> 10:14.220
Success.
A genuine Smurf-path.

10:15.000 --> 10:18.220
Those disgusting Smurfs have
to pass here sooner or later.

10:19.000 --> 10:22.049
And when they do,
we'll be ready.

Huh?

11:03.100 --> 11:05.019
Oh, gosh, look.

11:07.139 --> 11:09.159
Faster, Harmony.
They like your music.

11:09.179 --> 11:10.220
They do?

Hey, those fuzzles
have taste.

11:16.049 --> 11:18.159

I take them?

with all their

11:36.090 --> 11:38.129

to those poor little fuzzles?

12:19.129 --> 12:22.090
I'm not sure, Clumsy.
Let's find out.

are ours. All ours.
