00:47.180 --> 00:50.089
Good morning, Ulysses!

00:50.089 --> 00:51.043
- Good morning, Mom.

00:52.720 --> 00:55.080
Time to get up, sleepy head!

00:55.080 --> 00:57.867
It's another bright day in Greatland.

00:58.880 --> 01:01.003
The birthplace of love.

01:02.541 --> 01:03.941
- And endless source of fun.

01:40.480 --> 01:41.561
- Tuna sandwich!

01:41.561 --> 01:43.195
Yes! Yes!

01:45.860 --> 01:46.770
Thank you, Mom!

01:46.770 --> 01:48.900
Anything for my baby!

01:48.900 --> 01:52.683
Happy birthday, Ulysses!
I'm so proud of you!

01:53.980 --> 01:56.870
I still remember the day I gave you birth

01:56.870 --> 02:01.493
and immortality, my non
binary bundle of joy!

02:02.770 --> 02:05.200
Today is a very special day.

02:05.200 --> 02:07.853
You're fifteen now. So.

02:09.854 --> 02:10.687
- Oh no!

02:13.488 --> 02:15.700
Not the Dark Temple Ceremony!

02:15.700 --> 02:19.020
Ulysses! Every Great
must complete the Ceremony

02:19.020 --> 02:20.473
on his fifteen's birthday!

02:23.151 --> 02:24.560
Where are you going, young man?

02:24.560 --> 02:26.020
How many times have I told you

02:26.020 --> 02:27.660
not to leave food on the table?!

02:27.660 --> 02:29.854
- It's my birthday. I do what I want!

02:30.692 --> 02:32.340
Ladies, gentlemen,

02:32.340 --> 02:35.550
gender fluids, and
diverse living organisms!

02:35.550 --> 02:37.742
My fellow Greats!

02:45.920 --> 02:48.589
We are bringing you the latest

02:48.589 --> 02:53.021
from the race to the
Greatland's Sweetheart Position!

03:00.076 --> 03:00.909
Two candidates.

03:00.909 --> 03:03.703
Jorg Doberman and Cat Purry.

03:03.703 --> 03:05.670
Have
been going head to head

03:05.670 --> 03:07.567
soliciting your Tokens of Love.

03:12.350 --> 03:14.720
Today Jörg Doberman and Cat Purry

03:14.720 --> 03:16.570
wish a Happy Dark Temple Ceremony

03:16.570 --> 03:20.600
to Ulysses and many other
great boys across Greatland!

03:20.600 --> 03:23.510
Woof or Felinist, cast your Tokens of Love

03:23.510 --> 03:25.477
and make your candidate win!

03:28.160 --> 03:29.800
Cat Purry will build on
her career long effort

03:29.800 --> 03:31.470
to advance the Proud Felinist Revolution

03:31.470 --> 03:33.700
and modernize the S.L.A.V.E
Sanctuary to ensure that

03:33.700 --> 03:36.690
it meets the highest
standards of love and care.

03:36.690 --> 03:38.710
Here is what Jörg Doberman promises

03:38.710 --> 03:40.088
to do if he's elected.

03:40.960 --> 03:41.793
- Hey Jolly!

03:44.250 --> 03:45.793
Patrick, what's up!

03:49.240 --> 03:50.073
- Hi.

03:51.210 --> 03:52.763
We're fine I guess.

03:54.500 --> 03:55.333
Aren't we, love?

03:57.050 --> 03:59.593
- Bro, you shouldn't look
like a total delight!

04:01.540 --> 04:05.707
- Jolly and I didn't get
much sleep last night.

04:11.130 --> 04:14.273
It cried non-stop.

04:16.160 --> 04:19.633
Man, I don't know if I am cut out for it.

04:21.200 --> 04:22.853
Being a father sucks!

04:25.090 --> 04:27.040
- Listen, Patrick,

04:27.040 --> 04:28.190
you're my half brother,

04:29.530 --> 04:30.970
I don't want to be mean or anything,

04:30.970 --> 04:34.440
but why is your baby so

04:36.290 --> 04:37.403
diverse?

04:40.440 --> 04:43.030
Patrick's
father was a Diverse Great.

04:43.030 --> 04:46.080
Ulysses, you should be
ashamed of yourself for asking

04:46.080 --> 04:47.867
such insensitive questions!

04:47.867 --> 04:49.450
And you, Patrick!

04:49.450 --> 04:52.480
Why isn't the portrait of your
father displayed prominently

04:52.480 --> 04:53.763
in your household?

05:02.110 --> 05:02.943
- Wait!

05:04.050 --> 05:07.170
How come Patrick gets to know
who his Dad was and I don't?

05:07.170 --> 05:10.440
- Shush, you two are gonna make
the baby start crying again!

05:10.440 --> 05:13.020
Ulysses, you're
late for your daily dose

05:13.020 --> 05:14.941
of crazy fun!

05:16.493 --> 05:18.459
- You see! It's always
the same loving thing!

05:19.440 --> 05:22.577
I ask you a question and
you never ever answer me!

05:25.100 --> 05:27.823
- Jolly! Jolly! He's crying again!

05:27.823 --> 05:29.906
You really need to leave!

05:35.813 --> 05:37.410
Jörg Doberman!

05:42.450 --> 05:43.283
Cat Purry!

05:44.695 --> 05:45.862
Jörg Doberman!

05:48.291 --> 05:49.708
- Let's go champ!

05:57.380 --> 05:58.880
I'm Jörg Doberman!

06:00.060 --> 06:03.944
New Dawn for Greatland!

06:29.867 --> 06:31.220
- I'm Cat Purry

06:32.337 --> 06:36.133
and you're voting for Doberman?! Ew!

06:38.090 --> 06:39.273
How dare you!

06:43.843 --> 06:46.130
Born Great! Born Immortal!

06:46.130 --> 06:49.363
Hail Mother! And glory to Greatland!

06:50.460 --> 06:52.569
My fellow Greats,

06:52.569 --> 06:54.736
who wants to live forever?

06:56.255 --> 06:57.672
- Everybody. Duh!

06:58.890 --> 07:00.760
Now tell me,

07:00.760 --> 07:02.520
who deprived, robbed,

07:03.590 --> 07:05.860
viciously and cowardly cheated the Greats

07:05.860 --> 07:08.918
out of our hard-earned immortality?

07:08.918 --> 07:11.892
- Evil Nation! Evil Nation!

07:11.892 --> 07:13.571
- Evil Nation! Boo!

07:13.571 --> 07:16.848
- Evil Nation! Evil Nation! Boo! Down

07:16.848 --> 07:18.228
with Evils!

07:18.228 --> 07:20.510
Evil! Oh yeah!

07:20.510 --> 07:23.480
Now, I don't wanna die

07:24.350 --> 07:26.880
but my days are numbered!

07:26.880 --> 07:29.740
Soon, very soon,

07:29.740 --> 07:34.740
the Virus will begin its
heinous work inside my body.

07:39.434 --> 07:41.640
My hair will fall out,

07:41.640 --> 07:45.083
my skin will wrinkle and I will collapse!

07:46.428 --> 07:47.761
And so will you!

07:49.063 --> 07:52.020
Oh no! No!
We don't deserve it!

07:52.020 --> 07:55.417
- It's unbearable! It's unfathomable!

07:55.417 --> 07:58.158
It's unbearable! It's unfathomable!

07:58.158 --> 07:59.389
- Unbearable! Unfathomable!

07:59.389 --> 08:02.639
- We don't deserve! I don't deserve it!

08:03.528 --> 08:05.826
None of you deserve it!

08:05.826 --> 08:07.343
What is to become of us?!

08:07.343 --> 08:09.528
- What's the loving news?

08:12.990 --> 08:14.890
I'll be right there with you, Mr. Lee!

08:28.300 --> 08:30.770
- Rejoice my fellow Greats!

08:30.770 --> 08:33.160
Our salvation is near.

08:33.160 --> 08:36.380
The Altruists are always
coming one step closer

08:36.380 --> 08:38.240
to finding a cure for the Virus.

08:38.240 --> 08:39.327
- Oh! Yes! Cure!

08:39.327 --> 08:42.490
- The Evil Nation will
never triumph over us!

08:42.490 --> 08:45.080
Because they are all hate,

08:45.080 --> 08:47.923
and we are all love.

08:49.520 --> 08:51.600
Support the Altruists.

08:51.600 --> 08:55.280
Give freely of your Love
Tokens to help fund research

08:55.280 --> 08:57.872
to find a cure for the Virus.

08:57.872 --> 08:58.705
- Yes!

08:58.705 --> 09:00.695
- Your Tokens!

09:00.695 --> 09:04.470
By love, we live forever!

09:04.470 --> 09:06.587
- By love, we live forever!

09:07.571 --> 09:11.080
- Thank you, thank you
my beloved fellow Greats!

09:11.080 --> 09:15.310
I will make sure that these
Tokens of Love go directly

09:15.310 --> 09:18.743
to Altruists to fund
their anti-Virus research!

09:26.550 --> 09:29.786
- Amazing Love Store,
Stone Age tools and more!

09:35.410 --> 09:37.963
- Oh, I'm sorry Mr. Lee!

09:38.820 --> 09:40.510
I didn't mean to spook you!

09:40.510 --> 09:42.210
But the Altruists are this close

09:42.210 --> 09:43.780
to finding cure for the Virus.

09:43.780 --> 09:46.183
So can I please have my Tokens of Love?

09:54.067 --> 09:55.920
- Get away from me! What's this?!

09:55.920 --> 09:57.060
- Relax! It's "a birthday cake"!

09:57.060 --> 09:58.310
I baked it for you.

09:58.310 --> 10:00.960
Quick, Ulysses! Make a wish
and blow out the candles!

10:04.740 --> 10:06.800
Ulysses! Don't you dare partake

10:06.800 --> 10:08.180
in these Stone Age rituals!

10:08.180 --> 10:10.630
This cake is made of plants and animals.

10:10.630 --> 10:13.560
They are citizens of
Greatland just like you.

10:13.560 --> 10:16.850
Why do you want to hurt
your fellow Greats?

10:16.850 --> 10:20.983
Do you want to end up like
Mr. Lee, invisible and mute?

10:20.983 --> 10:21.816
- No!

10:22.800 --> 10:25.330
- Don't argue with Mother, Ulysses.

10:25.330 --> 10:27.600
Our hearts beat for Greatland.

10:27.600 --> 10:29.700
Let's make them beat as one with Mother's.

10:35.534 --> 10:38.800
I'm going to throw the cake away.

10:38.800 --> 10:39.823
Good girl!

11:11.331 --> 11:12.960
Ulysses, are you listening?

11:12.960 --> 11:13.840
- Yes, Mother.

11:13.840 --> 11:16.890
- Then tell me why the
Optimists made Mr. Lee invisible

11:16.890 --> 11:17.773
and mute?

11:19.110 --> 11:21.880
Ulysses! All Greats stand for tolerance,

11:21.880 --> 11:23.890
diversity and inclusiveness.

11:23.890 --> 11:26.870
But Mr. Lee chose a different path.

11:26.870 --> 11:29.300
What taboo did Mr. Lee break?

11:29.300 --> 11:32.653
How far back into Stone
Age did he regress?

11:34.410 --> 11:37.060
- Mr. Lee invaded and
contaminated the most sacred part

11:37.060 --> 11:39.040
of a woman a long time ago.

11:39.040 --> 11:40.370
The end.

11:40.370 --> 11:42.793
And what
happened to this woman?

11:56.810 --> 11:58.750
Yes, you can!

11:58.750 --> 12:00.570
Yes you can!

12:00.570 --> 12:01.570
Yes you can!

12:08.120 --> 12:11.903
Tell me, Ulysses. I
want to hear you say it.

12:18.620 --> 12:20.420
- Contamination by Mr.
Lee caused the woman

12:20.420 --> 12:23.130
to suffer vomiting, bleeding
and eventual collapse

12:23.130 --> 12:25.230
from unbearable pain during child rearing.

12:26.510 --> 12:28.240
Because of inbreeding,

12:28.240 --> 12:29.870
Mr. Lee's daughter was born so ugly

12:29.870 --> 12:31.547
that she was named "Ugly Duck".

12:33.050 --> 12:34.383
There, I said it.

12:35.250 --> 12:36.283
Now leave me alone.

12:46.250 --> 12:48.343
I'm sorry, she went on and on.

12:50.570 --> 12:52.582
- She just doesn't let go, does she?

13:06.090 --> 13:08.933
- Happy birthday, Ulysses!
Dad and I got you a gift.

13:12.210 --> 13:13.603
Open it! Tear the paper!

13:18.720 --> 13:21.780
- A book?! Are you out of your mind?

13:21.780 --> 13:23.420
You want me to end up
on Repentance Island?

13:23.420 --> 13:24.970
- But you love stories!

13:24.970 --> 13:27.430
We'll just read it here, in
secret like we always do.

13:27.430 --> 13:29.310
Remember how much fun
we had with Shakespeare

13:29.310 --> 13:31.170
and Charles Perrault?

13:31.170 --> 13:33.630
- Yeah, not really. I just pretended.

13:33.630 --> 13:36.470
Otherwise Mr. Lee wouldn't have
given me my Tokens of Love.

13:36.470 --> 13:39.420
Look, can we just paint my nails
blue like we did last year?

13:39.420 --> 13:40.253
- Open it.

13:40.253 --> 13:41.086
- No way!

13:47.597 --> 13:49.850
"Just open

13:49.850 --> 13:52.583
the damn book"

14:00.890 --> 14:03.857
"Ody-s-sey by

14:03.857 --> 14:04.690
Ho-mer.

14:07.104 --> 14:10.890
To my son Ulysses,

14:10.890 --> 14:15.650
on his 15th birthday.

14:15.650 --> 14:17.685
Wishing you to be better than me."

14:21.190 --> 14:23.090
My father's name was Homer?

14:23.090 --> 14:25.470
- No, stupid! Homer wrote the book.

14:25.470 --> 14:26.743
- Then who wrote this?

14:35.197 --> 14:37.927
"Your father, he gave this book to me."

14:42.620 --> 14:44.653
You knew my father all these years!

14:47.700 --> 14:49.137
Why didn't you tell me?!

14:53.697 --> 14:56.937
"Your father made me promise."

15:02.300 --> 15:03.133
Where is he?

15:06.330 --> 15:07.393
What's his name?

15:09.550 --> 15:11.430
Ulysses! You are scheduled

15:11.430 --> 15:13.563
for the Dark Temple Ceremony today.

15:16.200 --> 15:17.585
- I hate you!

15:17.585 --> 15:19.148
I hate everything!

15:19.148 --> 15:19.981
- Dad!

15:27.568 --> 15:30.036
- Where are you, Mr. Lee?

15:30.036 --> 15:31.281
Show yourself!

15:31.281 --> 15:32.281
- Dad?! Dad!

15:41.644 --> 15:42.477
Dad! Dad!

15:45.325 --> 15:47.283
Stop it you two!

15:47.283 --> 15:48.905
I've got the Virus!

16:00.783 --> 16:02.450
Ulysses, the countdown

16:02.450 --> 16:05.769
to your Dark Temple
Ceremony has been initiated.

16:22.270 --> 16:25.840
- Well, hello gorgeous! You're late.

16:25.840 --> 16:27.630
Let me give you a "quicky."

16:27.630 --> 16:28.753
By love,

16:30.160 --> 16:31.350
we live forever.

16:31.350 --> 16:35.093
And love is what binds you and
all our Greats to our Mother.

16:35.093 --> 16:38.030
It's what makes us all
brothers and sisters.

16:38.030 --> 16:42.670
Mother provides food, houses and Optimism.

16:42.670 --> 16:47.020
Today is the day that you
will give back to our Mother.

16:47.020 --> 16:48.660
Life Force will unite you

16:48.660 --> 16:51.670
and Mother together forever and forever.

16:54.220 --> 16:57.523
Now, this is where your
Life Force should go.

17:03.310 --> 17:05.920
The Angels will now perform
for you in the Worshiping Hall.

17:05.920 --> 17:07.950
Watch their every move,

17:07.950 --> 17:10.503
and Life Force will manifest itself.

17:12.341 --> 17:13.782
- Gotcha! Thanks!

19:25.220 --> 19:26.303
- Is she collapsing?

19:31.167 --> 19:33.800
"She'll be okay.

19:33.800 --> 19:36.030
This didn't happen.

19:36.030 --> 19:37.507
Don't tell anybody."

19:38.950 --> 19:40.550
Don't worry Mr. Lee.

19:40.550 --> 19:41.737
I won't tell anyone.

20:12.780 --> 20:13.863
- Hey there handsome!

20:14.990 --> 20:16.573
You've got something for me?

20:18.077 --> 20:20.340
Where is your Life Force, airhead?

20:20.340 --> 20:22.059
- What does it look like?

20:22.059 --> 20:24.253
- Look you're so cute!

20:25.840 --> 20:30.560
It's a white sticky substance,
sort of like boogers.

20:30.560 --> 20:31.393
- OK, gotcha!

20:36.950 --> 20:38.725
- There! All yours!

20:38.725 --> 20:40.303
- We're not done yet, love.

20:41.600 --> 20:42.923
Give me your pink one.

20:52.580 --> 20:54.410
Ancient scriptures!

20:54.410 --> 20:55.943
Do you know what these mean?

20:57.900 --> 21:00.163
I wish I could decipher ancient language.

21:01.150 --> 21:04.030
But oh well! That's what
makes us Greats great.

21:04.030 --> 21:07.790
Congratulations, you've completed
your Dark Temple Ceremony!

21:07.790 --> 21:09.163
Happy Adulthood!

21:11.820 --> 21:14.650
Your bundle of joy will
be issued to you shortly.

21:14.650 --> 21:16.930
Congratulations, Ulysses!

21:16.930 --> 21:19.570
I'm looking forward to
bringing your offspring

21:19.570 --> 21:22.693
into the world and parenting
it jointly with you.

21:24.470 --> 21:25.643
- Thank you Ma'am.

22:20.605 --> 22:22.207
- Dad! Dad!

22:22.207 --> 22:23.929
- What are you doing?

22:23.929 --> 22:24.770
Leave them alone!

22:28.846 --> 22:29.762
- No! No! Please, let him go!

22:29.762 --> 22:32.633
- Ulysses, let the Optimists do their job.

22:32.633 --> 22:35.730
They are here to liberate Ugly Duck.

22:35.730 --> 22:38.690
- For preventing the
empowerment of his daughter,

22:38.690 --> 22:41.400
the generous and loving Greats

22:41.400 --> 22:46.314
have decided to put Mr.
Lee out for Resurrection.

22:47.700 --> 22:48.807
- No!
- Please! Don't hurt him!

22:48.807 --> 22:51.832
- No! No! Mother, he
wanted to report the blood,

22:51.832 --> 22:55.360
I swear. He was just
waiting for me to come back!

22:55.360 --> 22:57.815
Mother, please! Please!

22:57.815 --> 23:01.681
- He didn't do anything! Please stop!

23:10.139 --> 23:12.563
No! No, no, no, no, no,
please, not the Pulverizer!

23:12.563 --> 23:15.650
Please! Please! Not the Pulverizer.

23:15.650 --> 23:17.733
- Mother, please! Please!

23:22.418 --> 23:24.585
- Activate the Pulverizer!

24:36.920 --> 24:38.960
Ulysses, what happened

24:38.960 --> 24:41.793
to Mr. Lee was an act of love.

24:43.770 --> 24:47.060
- How is pulverizing
someone an act of love?

24:47.060 --> 24:50.020
You're too
young to understand it.

24:50.020 --> 24:52.333
You need to sleep, Ulysses.

25:49.240 --> 25:50.073
- Ugly Duck?

25:54.610 --> 25:55.523
Ugly Duck?

25:59.630 --> 26:00.463
Where is she?!

26:00.463 --> 26:03.340
Taking her
Sensitivity Test as I told you.

26:03.340 --> 26:06.223
But as every man you're
not a terrific listener!

26:26.040 --> 26:30.100
- By love, we live forever!

26:30.100 --> 26:30.933
All right, ladies!

26:30.933 --> 26:33.200
- Hey, don't call us that! It's offensive!

26:33.200 --> 26:36.110
- Shut up and be proud of who you are.

26:36.110 --> 26:37.853
- Exactly! Be yourself!

26:40.010 --> 26:41.440
- And today is your lucky day

26:41.440 --> 26:44.020
because Greatland gives you just that!

26:44.020 --> 26:45.750
All Great women can choose

26:45.750 --> 26:48.593
between the Proud Felinist Revolution.

26:54.686 --> 26:58.093
Or the SLAVE Sanctuary.

27:06.800 --> 27:09.050
And SLAVE is short for?

27:09.050 --> 27:13.560
- Support, love, appreciation,
victory, empowerment.

27:13.560 --> 27:14.393
- Good!

27:16.010 --> 27:17.977
And this will help you choose your new

27:17.977 --> 27:19.803
and improved Testing Stick!

27:57.777 --> 28:01.167
- "Dear Ulysses, I write to you."

28:02.090 --> 28:06.123
- When that is said, what
more is left for me to say?

28:08.240 --> 28:09.930
Now you are free,

28:09.930 --> 28:12.420
I know too well to heap
contempt upon my head.

28:12.420 --> 28:14.390
- What's she talking about?

28:14.390 --> 28:17.757
- It's Pushkin, "Tatiana's letter",

28:18.780 --> 28:20.920
remember we read it last winter?

28:20.920 --> 28:24.283
- Oh that one! So inspiring, not.

28:25.250 --> 28:28.200
- I knew it would be just as
much poetry as you could take.

28:30.570 --> 28:32.483
But I feel like Tatiana right now.

28:35.100 --> 28:38.920
I sit alone with none to
heed or guess what ails.

28:38.920 --> 28:42.763
And now my very reason fails!

28:43.770 --> 28:47.700
I don't wanna be a Felinist or a SLAVE.

28:47.700 --> 28:50.103
I don't wanna take the Sensitivity Test,

28:52.260 --> 28:53.213
but I have to.

28:57.770 --> 28:59.660
If I perform well at the Test,

28:59.660 --> 29:01.170
the Altruists may resurrect my Dad

29:01.170 --> 29:02.970
when they find a cure for the Virus.

29:07.535 --> 29:09.952
I just want you to know that,

29:11.150 --> 29:13.943
on Earth but you my heart adores!

29:15.120 --> 29:17.333
That is ordained by fate, alone.

29:18.480 --> 29:20.913
It's Heaven's will: I am yours.

29:23.210 --> 29:27.300
Ulysses, you are and
will always be my Knight

29:27.300 --> 29:28.373
in Shining Armor.

29:34.340 --> 29:38.153
- I tremble to re-read, must end!

29:39.750 --> 29:41.403
Good bye forever,

29:42.930 --> 29:44.457
Ugly Duck, your friend."

29:52.920 --> 29:55.740
- Seriously? Delight, please!

29:55.740 --> 29:56.573
- Kiss me!

29:57.760 --> 29:58.593
- Gross!

30:26.737 --> 30:28.404
- Ah, yes, yes, yes!

30:33.246 --> 30:34.579
- Urgh, love no!

30:44.960 --> 30:46.680
- I have to see Ugly Duck!

30:46.680 --> 30:48.980
- Ulysses, she's not your property!

30:48.980 --> 30:51.490
Your behavior is not
worthy of a Great man.

30:51.490 --> 30:54.490
- I don't care! She's going
away forever, I have to see her!

30:57.468 --> 30:58.468
Surprise!

31:11.730 --> 31:13.680
It's a boy!

31:13.680 --> 31:15.000
- It's a rabbit.

31:15.000 --> 31:18.040
Come on, don't
be shy! Kiss your baby!

31:18.040 --> 31:20.470
I worked hard on this one.

31:20.470 --> 31:22.240
How shall we name him?

31:22.240 --> 31:23.980
It's got to be "Albert"!

31:23.980 --> 31:26.670
Oh, please, please! Pretty please!

31:26.670 --> 31:28.170
- Please tell me you're joking.

31:28.170 --> 31:30.830
Look at him,
Ulysses. He's just as cute

31:30.830 --> 31:32.770
and adorable as you are.

31:32.770 --> 31:35.050
I thought you'd be happy.

31:35.050 --> 31:36.033
- He's a rabbit.

31:37.050 --> 31:40.150
My son is a loving rabbit.

31:40.150 --> 31:42.440
Technically, he's also my brother.

31:42.440 --> 31:46.270
I'm so glad you've
finally come to you senses!

31:46.270 --> 31:49.230
Take your son in arms, Ulysses.

31:49.230 --> 31:52.320
It's your role now to
keep him safe and warm.

31:52.320 --> 31:56.630
Remember, true Greats are
inclusive, tolerant and diverse.

31:56.630 --> 31:58.330
We don't stigmatize.

31:58.330 --> 32:03.290
We love everybody and everything:
people, animals, plants,

32:03.290 --> 32:04.630
even insects.

32:04.630 --> 32:07.280
We are in love with love.

32:07.280 --> 32:10.907
But most of all, we love Greatland.

32:11.974 --> 32:13.653
- Son of a delight! He bit me!

32:14.780 --> 32:16.723
Welcome to parenthood!

32:18.420 --> 32:19.253
- Well,

32:20.220 --> 32:25.220
a house, a baby to take
care of, I'm all set then.

32:25.810 --> 32:27.810
How about a life partner?

32:27.810 --> 32:30.110
Do you have someone special at heart?

32:30.110 --> 32:30.973
- Not really.

32:32.790 --> 32:35.073
I'm going to take Albert to
the Priest for the blessing.

33:10.200 --> 33:12.300
- Looks like it's the Felinist Revolution

33:12.300 --> 33:13.829
for the three of you.

33:13.829 --> 33:18.278
- We gonna be sistas!

33:18.278 --> 33:20.957
- I knew it! I felt it!

33:20.957 --> 33:24.263
- I'm gonna rock the love out
of the Felinist Revolution!

33:53.609 --> 33:54.859
Yes! Felinists!

34:02.882 --> 34:06.103
- All right, this one's
going to be a SLAVE.

34:11.860 --> 34:14.970
Split up and let her go!

34:14.970 --> 34:17.143
It's not like she's caught
a Virus or anything.

34:39.080 --> 34:40.513
Oh come on!

34:41.970 --> 34:45.823
Mom, I can't see anything,
is she a SLAVE or a Felinist?

34:49.162 --> 34:50.812
- I can't see it! I can't see it!

34:52.953 --> 34:54.563
- Come out already!

34:56.470 --> 34:57.510
- Wait! Don't go!

34:57.510 --> 34:59.460
We still have this one left!

35:01.550 --> 35:04.010
Oh, just came to my mind!

35:04.010 --> 35:07.453
Do you see this nice orphan
birch tree down the street?

35:08.630 --> 35:10.260
Isn't she cute?

35:10.260 --> 35:12.640
So far no one had the generosity

35:12.640 --> 35:14.480
to embrace the pretty birch.

35:14.480 --> 35:17.290
A little birdie tells me
that this generous soul

35:17.290 --> 35:18.553
might just be you.

35:26.697 --> 35:28.850
Are you OK, my love?

35:28.850 --> 35:31.073
You should go see a healer.

35:37.810 --> 35:38.643
- I'm fine.

35:41.570 --> 35:42.403
I'm Great.

35:47.790 --> 35:48.690
Never been better!

35:56.870 --> 35:58.340
- It never does that.

36:08.630 --> 36:09.463
Hello?

36:42.570 --> 36:46.233
- My, it's really quiet here today!

36:48.720 --> 36:52.800
- Today's Sensitivity Test went so wrong!

36:52.800 --> 36:54.170
But I saved the day.

36:54.170 --> 36:56.653
All the Girls are sorted
out and on their way.

37:02.440 --> 37:04.603
- So there was this really ugly girl.

37:05.660 --> 37:09.940
Red hair, blue eyes, you
know what happened to her?

37:09.940 --> 37:13.370
- Ah that girl, what a mess!

37:13.370 --> 37:15.750
Her results they went on and on,

37:15.750 --> 37:19.353
and in the end she was
sent to Repentance Island.

37:21.980 --> 37:24.223
- Can you bless my son Albert?

37:27.559 --> 37:29.733
- Isn't he precious!

37:31.510 --> 37:33.853
- By love, we live forever!

37:35.320 --> 37:36.943
You've been blessed.

37:39.459 --> 37:42.720
Ah! Son of a delight! He bit me!

37:45.240 --> 37:46.680
Are you OK, my love?

37:46.680 --> 37:48.477
You should go see a healer.

38:12.000 --> 38:12.833
- Mom?

38:17.785 --> 38:18.618
Hello!

38:20.950 --> 38:21.783
Are you there?

38:34.630 --> 38:35.913
Always wanted to do it.

38:39.897 --> 38:41.113
You see, Mom,

38:41.970 --> 38:44.170
Mr. Lee taught me how
to talk to appliances.

38:45.120 --> 38:47.913
That heart simulator over
there, we built it together.

39:00.421 --> 39:02.588
What do I do now, Mr. Lee?

39:27.550 --> 39:29.483
Hello, world!

39:30.730 --> 39:31.930
Hello, world!

39:35.690 --> 39:38.630
- Guide me to Repentance Island.

39:38.630 --> 39:40.503
Action not authorized.

39:41.840 --> 39:43.820
- Where is Repentance Island?

39:43.820 --> 39:46.130
Answer not authorized.

39:46.130 --> 39:47.163
- Authorized by who?

39:48.080 --> 39:50.173
Answer me, Mother-loving appliance!

39:55.710 --> 39:58.660
Oh Ulysses, is
this how you repay my love?

39:58.660 --> 40:00.540
How could you break my heart like this?

40:00.540 --> 40:02.630
You hurt me, your Mother who loves

40:02.630 --> 40:04.040
and cares so much about you!

40:04.040 --> 40:05.440
- Shush! Shush! Shush, be quiet!

40:05.440 --> 40:06.413
This device will
self-destroy in three, two, one.

40:06.413 --> 40:08.503
- Oh no! No, no! Mom, please!

40:10.010 --> 40:11.160
If you're hearing this message,

40:11.160 --> 40:14.050
you've successfully
destroyed your bracelet.

40:14.050 --> 40:15.670
Now run.

40:15.670 --> 40:17.730
The Optimists are on their way.

40:17.730 --> 40:21.572
Do what your namesake in
"Odyssey" did, Follow Orion.

40:45.269 --> 40:49.557
Mirror,
mirror, on the wall.

40:55.876 --> 40:58.105
Mirror, mirror, on the wall.

40:58.105 --> 41:00.964
Mirror, mirror, on the wall.

41:00.964 --> 41:02.340
Mirror, mirror, on the wall.

41:23.722 --> 41:27.622
- Let the Debate about
Greatland's next Sweetheart begin!

41:28.455 --> 41:30.134
- Yeah, you go Jörg!

41:30.134 --> 41:33.907
- You shut your pie hole! Jörg
Doberman is a speciest pig!

41:33.907 --> 41:34.993
- He's a dog.

41:42.979 --> 41:45.060
- Now why are you crying?

41:45.060 --> 41:47.027
- To see Cat like this,

41:48.070 --> 41:50.880
she's so caring so inspiring.

41:50.880 --> 41:53.750
- I'm not a cat but I wish I was.

41:53.750 --> 41:57.230
It would be great to be born
as one of Cat Purry's kittens.

41:57.230 --> 42:01.133
- And to know the Evil
Nation created this Virus.

42:02.639 --> 42:06.930
- So here I am totally not
a cat, but a proud member

42:06.930 --> 42:09.827
of the "I am a CAT" gang
of totally cool people.

42:09.827 --> 42:11.780
- What about non-people, huh?

42:11.780 --> 42:15.523
Plants, animals? Ever heard
of them, spoiled brat?

42:15.523 --> 42:17.480
- Yes, of course, plants and animals rock!

42:17.480 --> 42:20.288
And rocks rule! Wohoo!

42:21.121 --> 42:22.344
- Jörg Doberman on the other hand.

42:22.344 --> 42:24.729
Was accused of raping
a two year old coyote!

42:24.729 --> 42:26.540
Why's no one talking about this?

42:26.540 --> 42:28.090
- Innocent until proven guilty.

42:31.615 --> 42:32.803
- Stop fighting, y'all!

42:33.830 --> 42:35.443
Look how far we've come.

42:36.310 --> 42:39.930
There was a time when we had
to mate with the opposite sex

42:39.930 --> 42:40.930
in order to procreate.

42:40.930 --> 42:43.050
- Yeah, you go Jörg!

42:45.587 --> 42:47.450
- But not anymore.

42:47.450 --> 42:50.130
We are truly free to love whoever we want!

42:50.130 --> 42:53.068
- Spoken like a true Great!

42:53.068 --> 42:53.901
A true Great!

42:57.197 --> 43:01.594
- This is Malak and I vote
Malak as Cat's next mate.

43:01.594 --> 43:03.320
Malak! Malak!

43:03.320 --> 43:04.584
- Malak! Malak! Malak!

43:04.584 --> 43:07.840
- Now put your hands
together and remember:

43:07.840 --> 43:10.800
The whole world should serve your needs.

43:10.800 --> 43:14.297
Your opinion is the only one
that matters in Greatland!

43:24.200 --> 43:25.683
- Rejoicing in the breeze,

43:27.090 --> 43:29.193
Ulysses sat at the helm he steered.

43:31.730 --> 43:34.713
Watching the Pleiads,
and late setting Boötes,

43:38.880 --> 43:41.633
and Orion that never baths in the Ocean.

43:43.130 --> 43:45.750
For this star Calypso
had bidden him to keep

43:45.750 --> 43:49.787
on the left hand as he
sailed over the sea.

44:38.660 --> 44:39.493
- Ugly Duck!

44:43.403 --> 44:44.343
Come on!

44:45.760 --> 44:46.723
Stop pretending!

44:47.670 --> 44:50.417
Look, I don't have a bracelet,
Mother's not listening!

45:42.289 --> 45:43.372
It's not you.

45:55.950 --> 45:57.983
Men are so quick to blame the gods.

45:59.520 --> 46:01.393
They say that we devise their misery.

46:02.690 --> 46:06.400
But they themselves, in
their depravity design grief

46:06.400 --> 46:08.500
greater than the griefs that fate assigns.

46:10.250 --> 46:11.716
Yeah, right!

47:24.873 --> 47:25.706
- Amen.

47:38.150 --> 47:39.263
I know you're there.

47:43.351 --> 47:44.184
Come over.

47:45.115 --> 47:45.948
Help me.

47:50.730 --> 47:52.080
- You wanna fight, huh?

47:56.500 --> 47:57.333
You wanna fight?

47:59.963 --> 48:01.953
- And the Gods smile upon us.

48:04.780 --> 48:08.110
- We're bringing you some
exciting and disturbing news.

48:08.110 --> 48:10.640
Clashes broke out today between supporters

48:10.640 --> 48:15.640
of Jörg Doberman and
Felinists passionarias.

48:18.280 --> 48:20.680
- I am a simple Great.

48:20.680 --> 48:24.630
Cat Purry sets a wrong
example for hundreds

48:24.630 --> 48:27.930
of our life partners across Greatland.

48:27.930 --> 48:32.930
Now everybody must be furry
and have kittens as babies.

48:34.370 --> 48:37.223
Well, my wife is not furry,

48:38.948 --> 48:41.080
she is leafy.

48:41.080 --> 48:45.810
Where do we fit in Cat
Purry's perfect Greatland?

48:45.810 --> 48:48.240
- You anti-felinist, speciest jerk!

48:48.240 --> 48:49.480
Your Jörg Doberman is a tree hatist.

48:49.480 --> 48:53.123
How does it make you feel
when your tree is cut?

48:55.366 --> 48:57.602
- Jolly! Jolly! Jolly my love!

48:57.602 --> 48:59.113
- You did it to yourself.
- Are you hurt?

49:00.160 --> 49:02.240
You should be ashamed of yourself!

49:02.240 --> 49:04.104
- Oh I've got your baby!

49:04.104 --> 49:06.143
Oops, I dropped it!

49:07.260 --> 49:08.093
Not!

49:08.093 --> 49:09.630
- Please, please, give me my baby back!

49:09.630 --> 49:11.780
- Tree Huggers make me lose weight!

49:18.010 --> 49:19.720
- Felinist Revolution!

49:19.720 --> 49:22.130
It is your time to let it all out!

49:22.130 --> 49:23.103
Free yourself!

49:25.634 --> 49:26.910
- I'm not going for it!

49:26.910 --> 49:28.557
- What? It's my camera!

49:32.111 --> 49:36.361
- Oh well, I suppose the
heart wants what it wants.

49:37.768 --> 49:38.601
Sad, sad.

49:45.810 --> 49:46.743
- This is wrong!

49:47.960 --> 49:50.363
How will Altruists find
her for Resurrection?

49:55.600 --> 49:57.000
- What do you know of death?

50:02.710 --> 50:04.570
- More than you think!

50:04.570 --> 50:05.403
I've read about it!

50:05.403 --> 50:06.480
In books!

50:06.480 --> 50:11.480
- Wow! You can read! You're badass!

50:11.700 --> 50:14.160
- Well, reading is nothing!

50:14.160 --> 50:16.700
Counting and talking to
electronic appliances

50:16.700 --> 50:17.533
is much harder.

50:19.348 --> 50:21.760
- What've you done to your bracelet?

50:21.760 --> 50:23.053
- Why did you do that?

50:24.180 --> 50:25.780
I was just starting to like you!

50:28.585 --> 50:29.710
- What is your name, boy?

50:29.710 --> 50:30.543
- Nobody.

50:33.300 --> 50:35.000
- Where do you think you're going?

50:36.200 --> 50:39.510
You're a fugitive from Optimism.

50:39.510 --> 50:42.580
They catch you, they're
going to put you out

50:42.580 --> 50:43.703
for Resurrection.

51:03.900 --> 51:04.883
- Wait a second.

51:06.000 --> 51:07.283
This is my country.

51:08.600 --> 51:09.633
Why should I leave?

51:10.610 --> 51:11.443
You go!

51:13.750 --> 51:15.063
- Are you hungry?

51:38.842 --> 51:40.360
- Now you.

51:40.360 --> 51:43.657
- No! Fish is my fellow Great.

51:43.657 --> 51:46.437
- My God, what did they do to you!

52:02.899 --> 52:05.982
- You've no idea what you're missing.

52:12.530 --> 52:13.763
- If I try it,

52:16.370 --> 52:17.460
will it make me Evil?

52:17.460 --> 52:18.293
- No!

52:20.600 --> 52:22.363
Fish are true Greats.

52:23.660 --> 52:25.580
The fish loves you.

52:25.580 --> 52:27.430
It doesn't want you to suffer hunger.

52:28.300 --> 52:31.590
By eating it, you are
helping a fellow Great

52:31.590 --> 52:33.040
become an even greater Great.

52:49.860 --> 52:53.700
- Yuck! Your soda's really foul!

52:53.700 --> 52:55.033
Burns like a bee sting!

52:56.400 --> 52:58.703
- It's whiskey. Bourbon.

52:59.910 --> 53:01.543
Sorry, that's all I have.

53:05.620 --> 53:07.270
- Are you an Evil spy?

53:07.270 --> 53:08.270
What's your mission?

53:09.630 --> 53:13.050
- I'm not Evil. I am a fellow Great.

53:13.050 --> 53:14.023
- Yeah, right!

53:15.270 --> 53:19.330
Your bracelet has gradations
and says "Swiss Made."

53:19.330 --> 53:22.030
It's, like, the most Evil thing on Earth!

53:22.030 --> 53:23.740
- It's a watch.

53:23.740 --> 53:25.360
I'm a Clerk.

53:25.360 --> 53:27.820
We are guardians of continuity.

53:27.820 --> 53:29.690
We make sure that Greatland
does not disappear

53:29.690 --> 53:30.523
no matter what.

53:32.340 --> 53:33.540
- Never heard of Clerks.

53:39.565 --> 53:40.723
Oopsies,

53:43.550 --> 53:44.693
my head is spinning.

53:45.550 --> 53:47.163
- That's the alcohol's working.

53:48.450 --> 53:51.940
Doesn't it make all your
problems seem less important?

53:51.940 --> 53:53.453
- Greats don't have problems.

53:54.390 --> 53:57.923
Everything bad that happens
in Greatland is of Evil doing.

53:59.080 --> 54:02.690
When Ugly Duck and I were kids,

54:02.690 --> 54:06.850
we used to think Evils were
these huge hairy monsters.

54:06.850 --> 54:11.040
Anyway, Mother explained to
me that Evils were like us.

54:11.040 --> 54:13.600
Seriously, just like us!

54:13.600 --> 54:15.870
And they were lurking amongst us,

54:15.870 --> 54:18.033
doing their Evil deeds to doom us all.

54:19.011 --> 54:20.820
- A common enemy is the best way

54:20.820 --> 54:23.143
to unite a nation behind its government.

54:24.670 --> 54:26.937
- Yeah, that's what you have, right,

54:26.937 --> 54:28.270
in your Evildom?

54:29.859 --> 54:30.692
A Government!

54:41.970 --> 54:45.083
- Don't! Stop picking your nose.

54:47.680 --> 54:48.513
Stop!

54:51.210 --> 54:52.043
Who's Ugly Duck?

54:54.010 --> 54:54.843
- A girl.

54:57.310 --> 54:58.463
I think I like her.

55:00.380 --> 55:01.863
I like a girl.

55:06.030 --> 55:06.863
- Where is she?

55:11.070 --> 55:12.313
- Repentance Island.

55:14.780 --> 55:15.880
I'm going to save her.

55:17.700 --> 55:19.163
I'm her Knight in Shining.

55:21.630 --> 55:23.630
I'm her Knight in Shining Armor.

56:22.810 --> 56:24.923
- Dear God, you found the fugitive!

56:27.410 --> 56:32.410
- Yep, and I'm not doing your job again.

56:32.570 --> 56:35.170
- It's not my job to chase after them!

56:35.170 --> 56:37.540
Lady Omega told me to stay out of it.

56:37.540 --> 56:40.403
She's on the edge, borderline psychotic.

56:42.160 --> 56:44.253
- Fish rot from the head down.

56:45.270 --> 56:48.460
You gonna have to stand up to him one day

56:48.460 --> 56:50.645
or your children will be next.

56:50.645 --> 56:51.478
- Help me!

57:09.080 --> 57:09.913
- Hi there!

57:14.397 --> 57:16.840
I got you some cookies and milk.

57:16.840 --> 57:17.710
You used to like them.

57:17.710 --> 57:18.543
- Where am I?

57:19.560 --> 57:23.290
- Well, you're in your Dad's man cave.

57:23.290 --> 57:26.373
It's not really a cave,
it's an old garage but...

57:34.540 --> 57:35.767
- My Dad's man cave?!

57:40.560 --> 57:41.773
You knew my Dad?

57:45.380 --> 57:46.313
Is he here?

57:47.630 --> 57:49.753
- Why yes, he is.

57:54.480 --> 57:55.313
- Well,

57:56.450 --> 57:57.283
where?

57:57.283 --> 58:00.033
Where is he, when's he coming?

58:05.810 --> 58:07.303
- You're looking at him.

58:15.519 --> 58:18.769
Well, say something, what do you think?

58:21.470 --> 58:22.303
- No.

58:41.320 --> 58:43.330
- You wanna see what I'm doing?

58:43.330 --> 58:44.163
- No.

58:56.040 --> 58:57.290
- I re-set your bracelet.

59:00.480 --> 59:04.350
Your record is clean as a
whistle. You can go back

59:04.350 --> 59:06.483
to your life as if nothing ever happened.

59:16.110 --> 59:17.250
- You wanna get rid of me?

59:17.250 --> 59:18.973
- No, no, no, of course not.

59:20.630 --> 59:22.580
Just you don't seem to be happy here.

59:22.580 --> 59:25.900
So the least I can do is
facilitate your return

59:25.900 --> 59:26.733
to the mainland.

59:29.577 --> 59:30.577
- Did you know that,

59:33.900 --> 59:34.733
my son,

59:37.670 --> 59:38.653
your grandson,

59:40.200 --> 59:41.033
is a rabbit?

59:44.800 --> 59:45.963
And if I go back,

59:51.315 --> 59:52.520
I marry a birch tree.

59:52.520 --> 59:55.163
- No, no!

1:00:00.697 --> 1:00:02.677
- A hamster, then.

1:00:02.677 --> 1:00:03.510
- God no!

1:00:05.090 --> 1:00:06.673
I'm so sorry! I'm so sorry!

1:00:11.765 --> 1:00:12.848
I'm so sorry!

1:01:17.730 --> 1:01:20.560
- Mr. Doberman, Your Excellency!

1:01:20.560 --> 1:01:22.888
So honored to meet you!

1:01:25.800 --> 1:01:26.803
- Sit young man.

1:01:27.980 --> 1:01:29.150
It's just a dog.

1:01:29.150 --> 1:01:29.983
It doesn't talk.

1:01:31.089 --> 1:01:31.922
Good boy!

1:01:31.922 --> 1:01:32.755
Get out of here.

1:01:35.810 --> 1:01:37.123
You're breathtaking!

1:01:39.030 --> 1:01:39.863
Exquisite!

1:01:41.690 --> 1:01:43.357
I'm so glad I saw you.

1:01:45.190 --> 1:01:46.523
- I don't understand.

1:01:47.540 --> 1:01:49.920
- My little princess!

1:01:49.920 --> 1:01:52.023
I'm not gonna let anybody hurt you.

1:01:56.970 --> 1:01:57.973
Oh baby!

1:02:13.600 --> 1:02:14.543
- That's your Mom.

1:02:18.330 --> 1:02:20.080
- That's how I always imagined her.

1:02:23.330 --> 1:02:25.600
Do you think she'll forgive
me for breaking the bracelet?

1:02:25.600 --> 1:02:26.923
- Sit down, Ulysses.

1:02:30.670 --> 1:02:35.670
Your Mom, your real Mom was
flesh and blood like you and me.

1:02:37.320 --> 1:02:38.153
- Yeah, right!

1:02:39.850 --> 1:02:42.530
- Your reaction is perfectly normal.

1:02:42.530 --> 1:02:44.577
You've been brainwashed for fifteen years.

1:02:44.577 --> 1:02:47.710
- Do you mean she was a woman?

1:02:48.750 --> 1:02:51.590
like the one Mr. Lee contaminated
and got Ugly Duck out of?

1:02:51.590 --> 1:02:53.193
- Exactly! Well done!

1:02:54.440 --> 1:02:56.443
- Wow, you must feel awful.

1:02:57.390 --> 1:02:58.543
- No, not really.

1:02:59.610 --> 1:03:00.670
I'm angry

1:03:02.090 --> 1:03:04.143
she disappeared leaving you with me.

1:03:05.340 --> 1:03:07.943
Not note, not a word all these years.

1:03:10.810 --> 1:03:14.700
- That's why Stone Age procreation
is banned in Greatland.

1:03:14.700 --> 1:03:15.950
It's Evil!

1:03:15.950 --> 1:03:17.223
- She was Evil.

1:03:20.120 --> 1:03:23.173
- Oh, so I'm half Evil now?

1:03:24.545 --> 1:03:26.430
Although that would explain a lot.

1:03:26.430 --> 1:03:28.200
- Evils is not even their real name.

1:03:28.200 --> 1:03:31.780
I think initially they
were called Europeans

1:03:31.780 --> 1:03:34.580
or Chinese or Russians.

1:03:34.580 --> 1:03:36.240
Fascinating bunch!

1:03:36.240 --> 1:03:39.780
When I was young, I was sent
there to study their ways.

1:03:39.780 --> 1:03:42.943
But I fell in love with Evelyn.

1:03:45.100 --> 1:03:47.190
I returned with you to Greatland

1:03:47.190 --> 1:03:49.483
and openly confessed my sin.

1:03:50.530 --> 1:03:54.000
The Altruists decided to
keep me on the island.

1:03:54.000 --> 1:03:56.570
You were given a bracelet
and sent to the mainland.

1:03:56.570 --> 1:03:59.820
In the meantime, Lee had
eloped with the daughter

1:03:59.820 --> 1:04:01.293
of a high-ranking Altruist.

1:04:02.500 --> 1:04:04.650
When she died in childbirth,

1:04:04.650 --> 1:04:07.300
which tells you a lot about
the state of medicine here

1:04:07.300 --> 1:04:08.930
on the island,

1:04:08.930 --> 1:04:13.930
Lee was made invisible and mute
and sent back to Greatland.

1:04:14.910 --> 1:04:19.060
But he promised me to educate
you and take care of you.

1:04:19.060 --> 1:04:20.053
- And that he did.

1:04:21.340 --> 1:04:22.400
He and Mother and I,

1:04:22.400 --> 1:04:25.600
we were one happy family
before you showed up.

1:04:25.600 --> 1:04:26.660
Mother is the best!

1:04:26.660 --> 1:04:31.660
- Ulysses, the Mother of
all Greats doesn't exist!

1:04:32.120 --> 1:04:35.600
It is an automatic voice
application that runs

1:04:35.600 --> 1:04:38.480
on the bracelet broadcast system.

1:04:38.480 --> 1:04:39.810
- Yeah, right!

1:04:39.810 --> 1:04:42.120
You are just messing with me now!

1:04:42.120 --> 1:04:44.130
Mother told me you would.

1:04:44.130 --> 1:04:47.847
You got any other ideas
up your sleeve, "Dad"?

1:04:48.700 --> 1:04:49.653
Oh, I know!

1:04:51.180 --> 1:04:52.763
This is Repentance Island!

1:04:54.930 --> 1:04:56.893
- This is Repentance Island.

1:05:12.046 --> 1:05:13.129
- Oh delight!

1:05:14.340 --> 1:05:16.210
Oh loving delight!

1:05:16.210 --> 1:05:18.140
I've been blinded!

1:05:18.140 --> 1:05:19.950
- Calm down, calm.

1:05:21.242 --> 1:05:24.391
Repentance Island is not
what you think it is.

1:05:24.391 --> 1:05:25.590
- By love, we live forever!

1:05:25.590 --> 1:05:26.790
By love, we live forever!

1:05:26.790 --> 1:05:28.203
By love, we live forever!

1:05:29.456 --> 1:05:31.383
- Why do I even bother? Forget it.

1:05:52.820 --> 1:05:54.483
- Now you just hurt my feelings.

1:05:57.000 --> 1:06:01.480
Repentance Island is like the
spookiest place in Greatland.

1:06:01.480 --> 1:06:02.763
How did you end up here?

1:06:03.620 --> 1:06:05.403
- I was born here.

1:06:06.290 --> 1:06:08.403
Do you want to know how Greatland works?

1:06:09.240 --> 1:06:12.810
- No, not really. I'd rather
go find my friend Ugly Duck.

1:06:12.810 --> 1:06:14.870
- Well, you're not gonna
be able to rescue her

1:06:14.870 --> 1:06:16.913
unless you know what you're up against.

1:06:18.781 --> 1:06:21.423
- All right, go ahead, enlighten me.

1:06:23.150 --> 1:06:27.307
- This is the Mind Map of Greatland.

1:06:28.660 --> 1:06:30.793
Me and Lee designed it.

1:06:31.710 --> 1:06:34.320
The bracelet system was his invention.

1:06:34.320 --> 1:06:37.240
- Someone spoke to me right
before my bracelet blew up.

1:06:37.240 --> 1:06:39.350
He said, "Follow."
- "Follow Orion."

1:06:39.350 --> 1:06:41.170
- Exactly!

1:06:41.170 --> 1:06:42.570
And in exactly that voice!

1:06:42.570 --> 1:06:43.403
Do you know who it was?

1:06:43.403 --> 1:06:44.510
- It was me.

1:06:44.510 --> 1:06:47.793
I programed that message into
your bracelet many years ago.

1:06:49.840 --> 1:06:51.400
- So if I never broke my bracelet,

1:06:51.400 --> 1:06:52.800
you'd never reach out to me.

1:06:54.400 --> 1:06:55.503
- I knew you would.

1:06:57.300 --> 1:06:58.593
Let's not digress.

1:07:00.190 --> 1:07:02.760
The bracelets catch the
thoughts of all Greats

1:07:02.760 --> 1:07:06.050
and transmit them here to
the mainframe for analysis.

1:07:06.050 --> 1:07:10.113
Each thought is evaluated
on a three level scale,

1:07:10.980 --> 1:07:12.900
Basic - green,

1:07:12.900 --> 1:07:15.290
Slightly Above Average - yellow,

1:07:15.290 --> 1:07:17.343
Dangerous/Complex - red.

1:07:19.120 --> 1:07:22.730
This is SLAVE Sanctuary.

1:07:22.730 --> 1:07:25.730
The SLAVEs are refusing
to accept the authority

1:07:25.730 --> 1:07:28.360
of the Felinists over them anymore.

1:07:28.360 --> 1:07:30.087
- Wait, I thought the Felinists and

1:07:30.087 --> 1:07:32.030
the SLAVEs had nothing do with each other.

1:07:32.030 --> 1:07:34.120
- That's what Altruists want you to think.

1:07:34.120 --> 1:07:36.570
The main purpose of the Felinists

1:07:36.570 --> 1:07:39.950
is to control the female SLAVEs.

1:07:39.950 --> 1:07:43.840
Fun fact: 80% of Felinists are euthanized

1:07:43.840 --> 1:07:46.323
within the first three years
of joining the program.

1:07:49.840 --> 1:07:52.250
They are put out for Resurrection.

1:07:52.250 --> 1:07:54.950
And that is where the
second problem originated.

1:07:54.950 --> 1:07:58.690
A few years ago, instead of
euthanizing the Felinists,

1:07:58.690 --> 1:08:00.770
Optimists began saving them.

1:08:00.770 --> 1:08:02.110
- Like I want to save Ugly Duck?

1:08:02.110 --> 1:08:04.480
- Exactly! Felinists and Optimists

1:08:04.480 --> 1:08:08.603
who had "feelings" for each
other, started to ran away,

1:08:09.470 --> 1:08:10.973
began to pro-create:

1:08:11.840 --> 1:08:15.200
there have been at least three babies born

1:08:15.200 --> 1:08:18.377
in what I call "the
separatist territories."

1:08:20.390 --> 1:08:21.960
- Wow!

1:08:21.960 --> 1:08:26.070
- This spells the end of
the current social contract.

1:08:26.070 --> 1:08:28.650
We must act now!

1:08:28.650 --> 1:08:30.550
If Evils find out the true state

1:08:30.550 --> 1:08:32.050
of affairs here in Greatland,

1:08:32.050 --> 1:08:33.990
they'll wipe us out!

1:08:33.990 --> 1:08:37.683
I have a list of measures.

1:08:41.230 --> 1:08:42.413
- Dad, it's okay.

1:08:48.250 --> 1:08:49.500
- I'm so tired.

1:08:50.520 --> 1:08:52.123
I've been on my own so long.

1:08:53.300 --> 1:08:55.430
I feel like I'm going crazy.

1:08:55.430 --> 1:08:57.630
- You're not crazy, you
just worry too much.

1:09:01.160 --> 1:09:02.660
- What do you think of my map?

1:09:04.810 --> 1:09:06.810
- Don't worry, it's not accurate at all.

1:09:08.320 --> 1:09:09.800
I've been fooling Mother for years.

1:09:09.800 --> 1:09:11.610
I only told her what she wanted to hear.

1:09:11.610 --> 1:09:15.790
- Your bracelet always
flashed yellow or red.

1:09:15.790 --> 1:09:19.560
Mother's pretty accurate since
she's the only gadget around.

1:09:19.560 --> 1:09:21.210
- What's a "gadget"?

1:09:21.210 --> 1:09:23.500
- Gadgets are communication toys.

1:09:23.500 --> 1:09:27.260
Years ago, gadgets allowed
everybody to talk to everybody.

1:09:27.260 --> 1:09:31.100
But soon it became so loud
that nobody could listen

1:09:31.100 --> 1:09:33.060
to anybody anymore.

1:09:33.060 --> 1:09:36.770
So the Altruists decided to
get rid of all the gadgets,

1:09:36.770 --> 1:09:37.693
leaving just one:

1:09:38.960 --> 1:09:39.793
Mother.

1:09:41.050 --> 1:09:42.770
- And the Greats agreed?

1:09:42.770 --> 1:09:44.830
- They were relieved.

1:09:44.830 --> 1:09:48.810
By then they came to associate
happiness with a simple life.

1:09:48.810 --> 1:09:51.390
You'd be amazed at the
hardship people can accept

1:09:51.390 --> 1:09:53.183
if you put a positive spin on it.

1:09:54.090 --> 1:09:56.630
Positive Attitude Set-Up,

1:09:56.630 --> 1:10:00.030
that's what kept Greatland
going all these years.

1:10:00.030 --> 1:10:02.200
- Look, Dad, your map is dope.

1:10:02.200 --> 1:10:05.333
But I still have no idea
where to find Ugly Duck.

1:10:07.800 --> 1:10:09.970
- If she's anything like her mother

1:10:11.180 --> 1:10:16.170
or Lee when he was still
visible, she'd be a stunner.

1:10:16.170 --> 1:10:17.003
- She's kinda

1:10:18.360 --> 1:10:19.703
ugly beautiful.

1:10:21.640 --> 1:10:22.563
- Follow me.

1:10:26.550 --> 1:10:29.413
I think I know where she might be.

1:11:08.707 --> 1:11:10.957
- Who are all these people?

1:11:12.420 --> 1:11:13.533
- They are Altruists.

1:11:16.730 --> 1:11:19.703
- Is that lady testing
out a Cure for the Virus?

1:11:21.220 --> 1:11:22.130
- I don't think so.

1:11:22.130 --> 1:11:24.213
I think she's enjoying her breakfast.

1:11:26.760 --> 1:11:31.473
- Hey! Those are Tokens of
Love for the Cure research!

1:11:33.580 --> 1:11:37.980
- Kiddo, there is no such
thing as a cure against death.

1:11:37.980 --> 1:11:39.013
Altruists know it.

1:11:40.510 --> 1:11:41.640
They enjoy every moment

1:11:41.640 --> 1:11:45.000
of their life making
sure that you pay for it.

1:11:45.000 --> 1:11:48.570
- But that's so. Evil!

1:11:48.570 --> 1:11:51.740
- Exactly! This island is full of shit.

1:11:51.740 --> 1:11:53.990
Most Clerks became Altruists,

1:11:53.990 --> 1:11:55.830
or rebelled like Lee and were sent away.

1:11:55.830 --> 1:11:58.593
I'm pretty much the only
Clerk left standing.

1:12:04.560 --> 1:12:07.410
Keep your
moronic dog away from my cat!

1:12:07.410 --> 1:12:08.727
What do you want?

1:12:08.727 --> 1:12:10.457
The SLAVE Program!

1:12:10.457 --> 1:12:11.670
You
want those poor women

1:12:11.670 --> 1:12:13.880
to stop growing wheat
and start making weapons.

1:12:13.880 --> 1:12:14.930
Out of what?

1:12:14.930 --> 1:12:16.200
Thin air?

1:12:16.200 --> 1:12:18.570
Greatland has many enemies.

1:12:18.570 --> 1:12:19.960
Honey, please,

1:12:19.960 --> 1:12:22.550
the rest of the world follows our model.

1:12:22.550 --> 1:12:24.050
They love LOVE, they hate HATE.

1:12:24.050 --> 1:12:25.170
We make sure they do.

1:12:25.170 --> 1:12:28.363
- I don't care! Cat Purry
will win this election!

1:12:30.640 --> 1:12:32.053
Oh come in, Clerk!

1:12:34.640 --> 1:12:37.313
- Lady Omega, Alpha Altruist.

1:12:38.160 --> 1:12:39.480
- Hello, Clerk.

1:12:39.480 --> 1:12:43.010
Came to talk to my husband
about his little runaway whores?

1:12:43.010 --> 1:12:44.020
Go ahead.

1:12:44.020 --> 1:12:47.810
- No, Ma'am. Actually, I
came to draw your attention

1:12:47.810 --> 1:12:51.180
to recent developments

1:12:51.180 --> 1:12:52.533
in the Mind Map.

1:12:52.533 --> 1:12:56.070
- Oh very well, Clerk.

1:12:56.070 --> 1:12:58.140
Tell us how many millions
of Greats are ready

1:12:58.140 --> 1:13:00.562
to give their Tokens of Love to Cat Purry?

1:13:00.562 --> 1:13:02.420
- Greats are a dog nation, dear.

1:13:02.420 --> 1:13:05.453
They don't wanna see your
cat as their Sweetheart.

1:13:06.580 --> 1:13:08.233
- We'll see about that.

1:13:09.460 --> 1:13:10.653
Take care, Clerk!

1:13:19.060 --> 1:13:23.380
- The legend tells that
my great great-grandfather

1:13:23.380 --> 1:13:26.320
and a Navajo chief exchanged
their personal rifle

1:13:26.320 --> 1:13:29.473
and tomahawk to seal a peace treaty.

1:13:30.750 --> 1:13:32.840
- Why did the rifle come back?

1:13:32.840 --> 1:13:36.950
- The ugly truth is that
our side broke peace,

1:13:36.950 --> 1:13:40.180
murdered the Navajo
chief and all his tribe,

1:13:40.180 --> 1:13:42.453
took back the rifle and all his land.

1:13:45.610 --> 1:13:47.668
- I didn't know that,

1:13:47.668 --> 1:13:49.487
fascinating.

1:13:49.487 --> 1:13:50.813
And you are?

1:13:51.720 --> 1:13:53.230
- Nobody.
- He's my assistant.

1:13:53.230 --> 1:13:54.320
- What for?

1:13:54.320 --> 1:13:57.100
You're just inventing work
for yourself, old friend.

1:13:57.100 --> 1:13:58.150
- Not exactly.

1:13:58.150 --> 1:14:01.000
If you care to take a
look at the Mind Map.

1:14:01.000 --> 1:14:03.410
- He's pale. Whose kid is he anyway?

1:14:03.410 --> 1:14:05.560
I don't remember seeing him on the island.

1:14:05.560 --> 1:14:07.096
- He's the Policeman's.

1:14:07.096 --> 1:14:08.747
- Ah, bloody Irish!

1:14:08.747 --> 1:14:12.610
Those Policeman reproduce
faster than Cat Purry.

1:14:12.610 --> 1:14:15.040
You're lucky you have
such cute little sisters.

1:14:15.040 --> 1:14:17.310
- I'm sure his Dad will be pleased

1:14:17.310 --> 1:14:20.010
to know that the Alpha
Altruist fancies his daughters.

1:14:21.290 --> 1:14:23.630
- Get rid of this rusty old piece of junk.

1:14:23.630 --> 1:14:25.293
Let's talk business.

1:14:30.180 --> 1:14:31.603
- Wait for me outside.

1:14:39.520 --> 1:14:41.830
- Did you find my little princess?

1:14:41.830 --> 1:14:44.393
- She tried to swim to
the mainland, she drowned.

1:14:45.790 --> 1:14:47.620
- Why would she try to run away?

1:14:47.620 --> 1:14:49.710
I treated her like my own daughter!

1:14:49.710 --> 1:14:51.333
- She was tortured.

1:14:54.670 --> 1:14:55.503
- Clerk,

1:14:56.970 --> 1:14:58.510
I've known you forever.

1:14:58.510 --> 1:15:00.280
Do you think I could possibly torture

1:15:00.280 --> 1:15:01.460
a little girl like that?

1:15:01.460 --> 1:15:02.493
- Of course, not.

1:15:03.380 --> 1:15:05.683
But somebody tortured her.

1:15:07.640 --> 1:15:09.433
- I passed her down to.

1:15:10.760 --> 1:15:12.440
the Philanthropist!

1:15:12.440 --> 1:15:13.273
Ask him.

1:15:14.920 --> 1:15:16.513
If he tortured her, that's it!

1:15:17.750 --> 1:15:19.870
I will send him no more of the new ones.

1:15:19.870 --> 1:15:21.983
No more of the new ones.

1:15:34.590 --> 1:15:36.094
- Psst!

1:15:36.094 --> 1:15:36.927
Ugly Duck!

1:15:40.250 --> 1:15:41.083
Ugly Duck!

1:15:56.890 --> 1:15:58.200
- Wow!

1:15:58.200 --> 1:15:59.469
You look beautiful!

1:15:59.469 --> 1:16:01.669
- Thank you. You're not
too shabby yourself.

1:16:02.930 --> 1:16:04.000
- Meh!

1:16:04.000 --> 1:16:05.230
My Dad made me wear these.

1:16:05.230 --> 1:16:06.433
I had to blend in.

1:16:10.230 --> 1:16:11.784
- Who gave you this?

1:16:11.784 --> 1:16:12.617
Where did you get this?

1:16:12.617 --> 1:16:14.800
- Alpha Altruist, he's really nice.

1:16:14.800 --> 1:16:16.700
And did you see Jörg
Doberman and Cat Purry?

1:16:16.700 --> 1:16:17.760
- We have to go, now!

1:16:17.760 --> 1:16:20.063
- No! I'm not your property!

1:16:22.800 --> 1:16:24.223
- But I came to save you!

1:16:25.550 --> 1:16:27.090
- From what?

1:16:27.090 --> 1:16:30.130
- Relax, old friend.
Greatland is doing just fine.

1:16:30.130 --> 1:16:33.170
We have successfully avoided
a totalitarian dictatorship

1:16:33.170 --> 1:16:36.100
and steered the ship
toward a supra-democracy.

1:16:36.100 --> 1:16:38.530
The Gender War is over.

1:16:38.530 --> 1:16:40.420
Minorities decide for the majority.

1:16:40.420 --> 1:16:45.033
And every Great has rights
but no responsibilities.

1:16:45.890 --> 1:16:47.043
On that note,

1:16:48.080 --> 1:16:50.600
let's enjoy this beautiful sunset

1:16:50.600 --> 1:16:52.360
on this perfect island, shall we?

1:16:52.360 --> 1:16:55.650
- But the social peace is fragile,

1:16:55.650 --> 1:16:58.883
replenishment of the population an issue.

1:17:00.032 --> 1:17:01.970
Greatland has lost its economic

1:17:01.970 --> 1:17:05.650
and technological advantages to Evildom.

1:17:05.650 --> 1:17:07.853
- Enough! I'm gonna say this one time:

1:17:09.160 --> 1:17:11.623
Don't be paranoid!

1:17:20.720 --> 1:17:24.180
- Alpha Altruist rescued
me from the Optimists.

1:17:24.180 --> 1:17:26.148
He loves me like his own daughter.

1:17:26.148 --> 1:17:27.630
- You don't understand anything!

1:17:27.630 --> 1:17:30.513
The girl who was here
before you, they killed her!

1:17:31.540 --> 1:17:33.080
- What's "killed"?

1:17:33.080 --> 1:17:34.840
- It's that Stone Age thing
we read about in books!

1:17:34.840 --> 1:17:36.990
You're put out but like, forever!

1:17:36.990 --> 1:17:39.160
No Resurrection, nada!

1:17:39.160 --> 1:17:42.000
- Alpha Altruist said he'd
never let anyone hurt me.

1:17:42.000 --> 1:17:44.610
This is the safest place on Earth!

1:17:44.610 --> 1:17:46.860
Ulysses, I love you, to what end deceive?

1:17:46.860 --> 1:17:49.880
But I am now another's bride.

1:17:49.880 --> 1:17:51.703
For ever faithful will abide.

1:18:06.750 --> 1:18:07.893
- Shit.

1:18:10.861 --> 1:18:11.694
- What?

1:18:13.620 --> 1:18:15.240
- Shit.

1:18:15.240 --> 1:18:18.487
When I am angry I say "shit".

1:18:20.300 --> 1:18:22.427
- We say "Love" and "Delight".

1:18:23.370 --> 1:18:24.870
But I like your "Shit" better.

1:18:26.070 --> 1:18:27.457
- Now say "Fuck!"

1:18:28.647 --> 1:18:29.737
- "Fuck"

1:18:29.737 --> 1:18:30.957
- Fuck!

1:18:30.957 --> 1:18:31.790
- Fuck!

1:18:31.790 --> 1:18:32.623
- Fu uuuuu-ck!

1:18:32.623 --> 1:18:33.664
Shit!
- Fuck!

1:18:33.664 --> 1:18:34.810
- Shit!
- Fuck!

1:18:34.810 --> 1:18:35.680
- Fuck!
- Fuck!

1:18:35.680 --> 1:18:36.742
- Shit!
- Shit!

1:18:36.742 --> 1:18:38.017
- Fuck!
- Shit!

1:18:38.017 --> 1:18:38.850
- Fuck!
- Fuck!

1:18:38.850 --> 1:18:39.683
- Fuck!
- Fuck!

1:18:52.540 --> 1:18:53.533
- Hello, Clerk.

1:18:54.810 --> 1:18:56.960
Jesus, I've known you for so long

1:18:56.960 --> 1:18:58.633
that I forgot your real name.

1:18:59.730 --> 1:19:00.833
- I forgot myself.

1:19:12.210 --> 1:19:14.900
- Sometimes this island
feels like a prison.

1:19:14.900 --> 1:19:17.040
We certainly behave like prisoners.

1:19:17.040 --> 1:19:20.320
Going by nicknames, dreaming of escaping.

1:19:20.320 --> 1:19:23.385
- Pour vivre heureux, vivons cachés.

1:19:24.218 --> 1:19:26.513
- Yes, to live happy let's live hidden.

1:19:28.160 --> 1:19:29.580
But don't you just wanna
go back to Greatland

1:19:29.580 --> 1:19:32.513
and restore everything
to how it was before?

1:19:33.570 --> 1:19:34.730
We'll drop the act.

1:19:34.730 --> 1:19:37.820
Call ourselves by our
real names and titles.

1:19:37.820 --> 1:19:40.230
Call everything by what it is.

1:19:40.230 --> 1:19:42.350
- You would hold the mirror up

1:19:42.350 --> 1:19:45.570
to the masses of depressed
and neglected people.

1:19:45.570 --> 1:19:47.187
What do you think the result would be?

1:19:47.187 --> 1:19:48.783
- I have no idea.

1:19:50.120 --> 1:19:52.113
But I want real power.

1:19:53.380 --> 1:19:55.353
Not this golden retirement!

1:19:56.210 --> 1:19:59.280
Are you too have this thirst,

1:19:59.280 --> 1:20:02.040
this passion for real impact?

1:20:02.040 --> 1:20:05.010
You want to leave a legacy.

1:20:05.010 --> 1:20:06.800
You and I, we've been waiting

1:20:06.800 --> 1:20:10.390
in the shadow of Alpha
Altruist for decades.

1:20:10.390 --> 1:20:12.093
I've had enough!

1:20:13.040 --> 1:20:14.533
What about you?

1:20:16.970 --> 1:20:18.733
- It won't work.

1:20:19.630 --> 1:20:24.630
We have no resources to
take power in Greatland.

1:20:24.760 --> 1:20:27.570
- You are the smartest
and most competent person

1:20:27.570 --> 1:20:28.800
on this island.

1:20:28.800 --> 1:20:31.450
I'm the voice of Mother.

1:20:31.450 --> 1:20:34.510
Together we can figure it out.

1:20:39.977 --> 1:20:42.450
- We're a dying breed.

1:20:42.450 --> 1:20:44.743
We've been here our entire lives.

1:20:45.880 --> 1:20:48.223
It's too late in the day for escaping.

1:21:00.310 --> 1:21:01.143
- Coward!

1:21:11.980 --> 1:21:15.400
- She thinks that you are
the most competent guy

1:21:15.400 --> 1:21:16.673
on the island!

1:21:18.190 --> 1:21:21.143
And why is no one happy
in a Stone Age marriage?

1:21:21.980 --> 1:21:25.350
- I have a feeling that she's gonna try

1:21:25.350 --> 1:21:27.963
and overthrow the Alpha Altruist.

1:21:29.040 --> 1:21:29.913
- Seriously?

1:21:31.610 --> 1:21:33.390
Well, then why didn't you
take her up on her offer?

1:21:33.390 --> 1:21:35.710
- Because the future of
Greatland will be determined

1:21:35.710 --> 1:21:37.250
by young people

1:21:38.870 --> 1:21:39.983
like you.

1:21:42.270 --> 1:21:45.149
And the strongest amongst them.

1:21:45.149 --> 1:21:47.120
- Don't look at me! I'm not strong.

1:21:47.120 --> 1:21:48.570
- I beg to differ.

1:21:48.570 --> 1:21:50.960
You smashed your bracelet.

1:21:50.960 --> 1:21:54.080
You came to the aid of
a damsel in distress.

1:21:54.080 --> 1:21:55.810
You are a rebel!

1:21:55.810 --> 1:21:58.147
Live with it, embrace it.

1:21:58.147 --> 1:21:59.943
- You really think I'm that dumb?

1:22:01.520 --> 1:22:04.120
You didn't give a shit about
me until you needed me.

1:22:05.220 --> 1:22:07.920
Now you expect me to achieve
everything you failed at.

1:22:09.150 --> 1:22:10.133
Crafty, Dad!

1:22:10.980 --> 1:22:12.123
Real crafty.

1:22:15.920 --> 1:22:16.793
- Yeah, well,

1:22:18.250 --> 1:22:19.083
that's about it.

1:22:23.170 --> 1:22:24.003
- Unbelievable!

1:22:25.890 --> 1:22:28.663
She was right, you are a coward.

1:22:30.370 --> 1:22:32.483
- I'm out! Thanks for the cookies, Dad.

1:22:34.000 --> 1:22:36.143
- Take your emotions out of the equation.

1:22:38.050 --> 1:22:39.363
Think like a Clerk.

1:22:42.060 --> 1:22:42.893
- All right!

1:22:44.833 --> 1:22:47.070
You help me to take Ugly Duck
away from the Alpha Altruist,

1:22:47.070 --> 1:22:48.757
and I'm game to save Greatland.

1:22:51.820 --> 1:22:52.653
Come on!

1:22:54.150 --> 1:22:55.173
Think like a Clerk.

1:22:57.840 --> 1:22:58.673
- Deal.

1:23:04.730 --> 1:23:05.563
- All right.

1:23:06.630 --> 1:23:09.600
Let's find out who's
killing all the Great girls,

1:23:09.600 --> 1:23:11.211
and show them that Clerks have teeth.

1:23:42.919 --> 1:23:44.919
- Is this bug an insect?

1:23:46.740 --> 1:23:47.683
Can it be?

1:23:50.870 --> 1:23:51.703
- Philanthropist,

1:23:51.703 --> 1:23:55.550
the Alpha Altruist wants
to know what happened

1:23:55.550 --> 1:23:58.307
to the last girl he passed on to you.

1:23:59.808 --> 1:24:00.641
- Oh yes!

1:24:01.877 --> 1:24:04.173
The blond beast of prey,

1:24:06.830 --> 1:24:08.363
the magnificent blond beast!

1:24:10.000 --> 1:24:12.860
- Except this one wasn't avidly prowling

1:24:12.860 --> 1:24:15.090
for spoils of victory.

1:24:15.090 --> 1:24:17.560
She was tortured and drowned.

1:24:19.630 --> 1:24:20.463
- Round bugs,

1:24:22.992 --> 1:24:23.909
shiny bugs,

1:24:26.480 --> 1:24:27.313
fat bugs,

1:24:29.250 --> 1:24:30.083
lady bugs.

1:24:33.970 --> 1:24:35.053
I love bugs!

1:24:36.420 --> 1:24:38.210
- He's full blast into bugs.

1:24:38.210 --> 1:24:39.043
- No kidding?

1:24:41.570 --> 1:24:42.763
Philanthropist!

1:24:44.190 --> 1:24:45.813
Who killed the girl?

1:24:47.746 --> 1:24:52.142
- Heaven has no rage

1:24:52.142 --> 1:24:54.913
like love to hatred turned,

1:24:57.000 --> 1:24:58.970
nor hell a fury

1:25:00.640 --> 1:25:02.340
like a woman scorned.

1:25:04.589 --> 1:25:06.089
- "Woman scorned",

1:25:07.250 --> 1:25:09.400
that sounds like the
Alpha Altruist's wife.

1:25:10.670 --> 1:25:14.530
- Ex ore parvulorum veritas.

1:25:16.467 --> 1:25:18.167
- "This child speaks the truth."

1:25:21.020 --> 1:25:23.343
Then Lady Omega has gone bonkers.

1:25:26.630 --> 1:25:28.133
Ugly Duck is in danger.

1:25:30.007 --> 1:25:32.653
Greatland is in danger. We must hurry!

1:25:33.620 --> 1:25:34.470
- Cool bugs, man!

1:26:10.367 --> 1:26:12.433
"To whom it may concern,

1:26:13.350 --> 1:26:15.180
I had killed myself.

1:26:15.180 --> 1:26:19.010
My wife will become the next
Sweetheart of Greatland.

1:26:19.010 --> 1:26:21.747
Take care, the Alpha Altruist."

1:26:23.010 --> 1:26:26.593
- She can't even write
a decent suicide note.

1:26:28.880 --> 1:26:30.713
Ulysses!

1:26:33.531 --> 1:26:35.364
- Time's up Ugly Duck!

1:26:36.634 --> 1:26:37.884
Stupid redhead!

1:26:39.479 --> 1:26:41.229
Die you little whore!

1:26:42.438 --> 1:26:43.271
- Dad?

1:26:43.271 --> 1:26:44.104
- Die now!

1:26:46.322 --> 1:26:48.068
Ugly redhead you!

1:26:48.068 --> 1:26:49.568
- Ulysses help me!

1:26:51.723 --> 1:26:53.993
- Just how fucking dumb is she!

1:26:55.130 --> 1:26:56.933
- No Dad! You could kill Ugly Duck!

1:26:56.933 --> 1:26:58.233
I have to go and save her!

1:27:03.681 --> 1:27:06.048
Not my Mother, not my Sweetheart.

1:27:10.116 --> 1:27:10.949
Fuck!

1:27:23.986 --> 1:27:25.683
- I'm so sorry, Ulysses!

1:27:27.560 --> 1:27:29.032
You were right!

1:27:29.032 --> 1:27:30.760
Alpha Altruist tried to contaminate me

1:27:30.760 --> 1:27:33.040
with his Life Force when his wife.

1:27:33.040 --> 1:27:34.033
- Small wonder

1:27:35.829 --> 1:27:39.593
that Trojans and Achaeans endured so much

1:27:40.880 --> 1:27:41.893
and for so long,

1:27:43.000 --> 1:27:46.173
for the sake of a woman so
marvelously and divinely lovely.

1:27:48.070 --> 1:27:49.527
- You read the "Odyssey"!

1:28:04.890 --> 1:28:05.723
- Gotcha!

1:28:10.680 --> 1:28:12.397
- She's heading to Greatland.

1:28:13.690 --> 1:28:16.870
Our self-proclaimed Sweetheart needs TV

1:28:16.870 --> 1:28:18.023
to make herself legit.

1:28:18.940 --> 1:28:19.840
- How do you know?

1:28:21.300 --> 1:28:23.850
- That's the advantage
of spending your life

1:28:23.850 --> 1:28:25.513
in the shadows of power.

1:28:26.360 --> 1:28:27.370
Plenty of time

1:28:28.530 --> 1:28:29.893
to observe,

1:28:32.012 --> 1:28:35.000
to learn

1:28:38.278 --> 1:28:39.278
and prepare.

1:28:49.460 --> 1:28:50.993
- My fellow Greats!

1:28:52.290 --> 1:28:53.537
The time has come.

1:28:55.670 --> 1:28:59.700
According to the Tokens of
Love cast for both candidates,

1:28:59.700 --> 1:29:02.167
the next Greatland's Sweetheart is

1:29:05.380 --> 1:29:06.213
I'm nervous,

1:29:10.135 --> 1:29:11.644
Jörg Doberman!

1:29:11.644 --> 1:29:13.061
- Let's go champ!

1:29:19.628 --> 1:29:21.176
- A dog again?!

1:29:21.176 --> 1:29:24.737
- No loving way! Fraud! Rigged! Boo!

1:29:24.737 --> 1:29:26.531
- Felinist goddesses!

1:29:26.531 --> 1:29:28.114
Join my Revolution!

1:29:37.192 --> 1:29:38.609
- I'm your Mother

1:29:39.677 --> 1:29:43.893
and I proclaim myself the
Greatland's Sweetheart!

1:29:47.360 --> 1:29:48.520
- Who the love is this?

1:29:48.520 --> 1:29:50.968
- Another one of those crazy Felinists!

1:29:50.968 --> 1:29:52.580
- I'm so confused right now

1:29:52.580 --> 1:29:53.930
it's making me lose weight.

1:29:55.200 --> 1:29:57.446
- My dear Great children!

1:29:57.446 --> 1:29:59.200
I'm your Mother.

1:29:59.200 --> 1:30:01.120
Don't listen to this woman.

1:30:01.120 --> 1:30:04.353
She's an anti-Felinist hate-monger.

1:30:05.240 --> 1:30:06.860
- Not my Sweetheart!

1:30:06.860 --> 1:30:09.790
I'm not her! I'm who I
am and I deserve better!

1:30:09.790 --> 1:30:12.920
- Try soul-crushing pain and
devastation and hopelessness

1:30:12.920 --> 1:30:14.730
to describe how we are
feeling in this moment.

1:30:14.730 --> 1:30:17.513
- No! Greats won't be silenced!

1:31:01.030 --> 1:31:02.380
My children!

1:31:02.380 --> 1:31:04.020
As your Mother,

1:31:04.020 --> 1:31:08.440
I'm appalled and saddened to
inform you that this morning,

1:31:08.440 --> 1:31:12.000
Jörg Doberman was cowardly
put out for Resurrection

1:31:12.000 --> 1:31:15.623
by this fanatic Felinist woman.

1:31:18.610 --> 1:31:19.450
- Didn't we just say.

1:31:19.450 --> 1:31:20.953
- Shush!

1:31:20.953 --> 1:31:22.820
Everything you're saying now

1:31:22.820 --> 1:31:25.800
is being broadcast across Greatland.

1:31:25.800 --> 1:31:28.510
- But didn't we just say
she was anti Felinist,

1:31:28.510 --> 1:31:31.160
and now we're saying she
is a Felinist fanatic!

1:31:31.160 --> 1:31:32.890
- It doesn't matter.

1:31:32.890 --> 1:31:34.590
Mother can say whatever she wants.

1:31:38.350 --> 1:31:40.443
- Clerk! Open up! We know you're there!

1:31:44.062 --> 1:31:46.340
- Enough is enough!

1:31:46.340 --> 1:31:48.007
Down with Felinists!

1:32:05.740 --> 1:32:07.860
- We're here on the order of Lady Omega.

1:32:07.860 --> 1:32:09.460
Release the hostage immediately!

1:32:10.940 --> 1:32:12.759
- What hostage?

1:32:17.380 --> 1:32:18.873
Is it what I think?

1:32:25.080 --> 1:32:25.913
- What?!

1:32:25.913 --> 1:32:27.323
I found her on the floor.

1:32:36.030 --> 1:32:37.650
- Unrest is spreading.

1:32:37.650 --> 1:32:39.097
We need to deploy the Optimists.

1:32:39.097 --> 1:32:40.740
- No way! This is fun!

1:32:40.740 --> 1:32:42.291
- This is not a joke Ulysses!

1:32:43.210 --> 1:32:44.610
- Clerk! Don't make me do it!

1:32:44.610 --> 1:32:46.610
- We're losing control of the situation!

1:32:48.590 --> 1:32:50.590
- Greatland is one big scam!

1:32:50.590 --> 1:32:51.650
No one cares.

1:32:51.650 --> 1:32:52.780
No one tells the truth.

1:32:52.780 --> 1:32:55.390
No one should be in charge of this mess.

1:32:55.390 --> 1:32:57.023
Let it all blow to pieces!

1:32:59.260 --> 1:33:01.123
- Is this how we kill each other?

1:33:02.420 --> 1:33:03.953
Ulysses, this is scary.

1:33:05.520 --> 1:33:07.173
How do we go back?

1:33:08.272 --> 1:33:10.650
In our "Amazing Love Store

1:33:10.650 --> 1:33:13.050
when something was broken, we'd fix it.

1:33:13.050 --> 1:33:15.848
Dad would never let us throw it away.

1:33:15.848 --> 1:33:17.143
I want my Greatland back.

1:33:19.330 --> 1:33:22.220
Please, make this madness stop.

1:33:22.220 --> 1:33:24.340
- The majority of Greats
are feeling the same way,

1:33:24.340 --> 1:33:26.250
I guarantee you they're scared.

1:33:26.250 --> 1:33:28.050
- Clerk! You're a dead man!

1:33:28.050 --> 1:33:32.060
- Ulysses, you came here as Nobody.

1:33:32.060 --> 1:33:33.133
Now you have Duck.

1:33:34.050 --> 1:33:36.793
Together, you are Everybody.

1:33:39.087 --> 1:33:41.670
- And what does Everybody want?

1:35:22.140 --> 1:35:25.050
My children, Greats don't hate.

1:35:25.050 --> 1:35:26.370
We love.

1:35:26.370 --> 1:35:28.370
No need to fight.

1:35:28.370 --> 1:35:31.230
I, your Mother, will make sure that sons

1:35:31.230 --> 1:35:34.470
of Jörg Doberman grow
strong and will compete

1:35:34.470 --> 1:35:37.990
for the Greatland's Sweetheart
title in the near future.

1:35:37.990 --> 1:35:41.080
By love, we live forever!

1:35:41.080 --> 1:35:43.240
Meanwhile, Cat Purry will act

1:35:43.240 --> 1:35:45.393
as Greatland's Interim Sweetheart.

1:35:52.220 --> 1:35:54.270
- Phew, what a scare!

1:35:54.270 --> 1:35:57.140
But all's well that ends well.

1:35:57.140 --> 1:36:00.020
All love and admire Cat Purry!

1:36:00.020 --> 1:36:03.585
- All love and admire Cat Purry!

1:36:03.585 --> 1:36:06.520
- The new Greatland Sweetheart!

1:36:06.520 --> 1:36:09.295
- The new Greatland Sweetheart!

1:36:09.295 --> 1:36:12.128
- Greatland! Greatland! Greatland!

1:36:26.923 --> 1:36:28.020
- Clerk! We're breaking in!

1:36:30.450 --> 1:36:33.357
- All right, time's up.

1:37:10.535 --> 1:37:11.368
- Come on!

1:37:27.850 --> 1:37:29.760
- Why did you blow up
the House on the Hill?

1:37:29.760 --> 1:37:31.140
I thought you were all for continuity!

1:37:31.140 --> 1:37:32.023
- I snapped.

1:37:35.680 --> 1:37:39.180
I owe your Father a great debt.

1:37:39.180 --> 1:37:40.513
This is for you,

1:37:41.633 --> 1:37:43.693
a small token of my gratitude.

1:37:45.200 --> 1:37:46.470
- Thank you, Uncle Clerk.

1:37:46.470 --> 1:37:48.450
- With the House on the Hill gone,

1:37:48.450 --> 1:37:50.950
this is the only thing
that commands the Optimists

1:37:51.870 --> 1:37:53.877
and pretty much everything in Greatland.

1:37:56.660 --> 1:37:58.210
You are Mother now.

1:37:58.210 --> 1:38:01.067
- Uncle Clerk, you mean so much to me.

1:38:04.833 --> 1:38:07.295
- Clerk! It's over! Give up Cat Purry!

1:38:12.157 --> 1:38:14.330
- Get to the boat! They won't
follow you to the mainland.

1:38:14.330 --> 1:38:16.910
They're shit scared of Greats.

1:38:16.910 --> 1:38:18.077
- No, I'm not leaving you!

1:38:18.077 --> 1:38:19.513
- Listen to me, Clerk.

1:38:20.660 --> 1:38:24.490
Rule Greatland in Cat Purry's name.

1:38:24.490 --> 1:38:27.540
Open the minds of the Greats gradually.

1:38:27.540 --> 1:38:31.640
No chaos, no brisk
moves, smooth transition.

1:38:31.640 --> 1:38:34.680
Study the Mind Map, it has many levels.

1:38:34.680 --> 1:38:37.910
Find the blueprint for the
Great Reform and follow it.

1:38:37.910 --> 1:38:39.073
- Please, come with me!

1:38:40.470 --> 1:38:42.560
- This island's all I know.

1:38:42.560 --> 1:38:44.963
I am a coward, Ulysses.

1:38:46.080 --> 1:38:47.880
I wouldn't last a day in a new world.

1:38:47.880 --> 1:38:49.418
- Ulysses hurry up!

1:38:51.210 --> 1:38:53.951
- By love, we live forever! Now go!

1:38:53.951 --> 1:38:55.001
Ulysses!

1:38:58.888 --> 1:38:59.721
- Hey!

1:39:00.787 --> 1:39:01.620
Hey!

1:40:07.430 --> 1:40:08.823
- Be strong saith my heart.

1:40:11.130 --> 1:40:12.020
I am a Clerk.

1:40:46.970 --> 1:40:50.920
There will be killing
until the score is paid.
