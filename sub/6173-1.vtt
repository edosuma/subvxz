00:55.680 --> 00:56.886
I'm scared.

00:56.960 --> 00:58.485
Don't be scared.

00:59.320 --> 01:00.651
Who is he?

01:00.800 --> 01:02.643
He's gonna be your teacher.

01:04.000 --> 01:05.843
This is a very good day.

01:06.720 --> 01:08.165
Do you know why?

01:10.320 --> 01:11.845
'Cause today is a beginning.

01:11.920 --> 01:13.922
- Your friend, Tobi?
- Mmm-hmm.

01:15.080 --> 01:17.321
I've known him for a long time.

01:18.560 --> 01:20.847
I've known him by other names.

01:21.160 --> 01:23.162
Grandma Lois knows him, too.

01:24.240 --> 01:25.924
I had to learn, too.

01:26.240 --> 01:28.242
It was hard at first.

01:28.520 --> 01:29.851
But it was worth it.

01:30.160 --> 01:32.003
Kristi, you're going to grow up

01:32.160 --> 01:35.084
and you're going to
have a son who is one of the chosen.

01:35.360 --> 01:36.486
And, Katie,

01:36.760 --> 01:39.081
your gift is your strength.

01:39.600 --> 01:41.602
A lot is going to be asked of you.

01:41.920 --> 01:43.843
You're gonna have to
take care of your sister

01:43.960 --> 01:45.086
and a lot of others.

01:45.360 --> 01:47.840
There's a special girl
out there, a lot like you.

01:48.040 --> 01:50.008
And he's going to bring her to us.

02:00.520 --> 02:02.363
What did you draw, sweetie?

02:02.720 --> 02:04.961
- Uncle Mike. Screaming.
- That's Uncle Mike?

02:06.120 --> 02:07.724
- Screaming?
- Mmm-hmm.

02:08.039 --> 02:09.530
Remember what we're
gonna do when he gets here?

02:09.800 --> 02:11.768
- Boo!
- Like, real big. Boo!

02:11.840 --> 02:12.841
Boo!

02:12.920 --> 02:14.331
You want to practice again
before he gets here?

02:14.440 --> 02:15.521
Boo!

02:15.640 --> 02:17.840
Hey, hey, hey!
Remember what we're gonna do, okay?

02:19.240 --> 02:20.730
Ooh.

02:21.600 --> 02:23.682
Spooky. Why is the door open?

02:23.760 --> 02:25.171
Boo!

02:25.280 --> 02:27.487
Oh, my gosh!
It's my favorite niece!

02:27.560 --> 02:28.561
What's up, bro?

02:28.720 --> 02:31.087
What is on that face of yours,
Uncle Mike?

02:31.160 --> 02:32.844
What? Oh, you like this?

02:32.920 --> 02:35.082
You fertilizing it?
Is that Monsanto?

02:35.240 --> 02:37.527
That's funny. Is this a rental?

02:37.600 --> 02:38.886
This is ridiculous!

02:38.960 --> 02:40.086
I can't wait to show you my room.

02:40.240 --> 02:42.527
It's nice and cozy in here.

02:42.640 --> 02:45.166
- Two.
- You have two rooms?

02:45.240 --> 02:48.164
- Hey! How are you?
- Mommy, Mike's here.

02:48.240 --> 02:51.608
Are you staying for a month?
That bag is massive!

02:51.760 --> 02:53.524
Is there anything in there for me?

02:53.600 --> 02:55.011
- Hey, good to see you.
- We love Mike.

02:55.080 --> 02:57.208
- Hey!
- You remember Skyler, right?

02:57.320 --> 02:58.731
How are you?
I haven't seen you in forever.

02:58.800 --> 02:59.801
Good. Yeah!

03:00.200 --> 03:01.201
- Hi.
- Nice.

03:03.440 --> 03:05.090
You look good. Your mustache...

03:05.160 --> 03:07.242
She's not European.
She's American.

03:07.320 --> 03:10.369
Two weeks? Really?
I thought you said two days.

03:10.440 --> 03:13.091
He just got dumped over email.
He's devastated.

03:13.160 --> 03:16.642
Babe, his bag is
his whole apartment. It's huge.

03:21.440 --> 03:23.010
Just making a rainbow.

03:23.280 --> 03:24.361
- It's okay.
- Sorry.

03:24.440 --> 03:25.885
Yeah, we didn't use that vase, anyway.

03:25.960 --> 03:27.450
Here's Uncle Mike.

03:29.440 --> 03:30.965
Oopsie!

03:31.040 --> 03:32.644
Why am I old all of a sudden?

03:32.720 --> 03:35.040
That's exactly what
you're gonna look like when you're old.

03:35.800 --> 03:37.564
- I love this.
- Don't encourage.

03:37.680 --> 03:39.011
What do you mean?

03:39.640 --> 03:41.165
Sounds so good!

03:41.480 --> 03:43.320
Leila, save the rest
for the talent show.

03:43.360 --> 03:44.691
You come to the talent show.

03:44.800 --> 03:47.167
I'm gonna be there.
I don't have a date, though.

03:47.240 --> 03:48.890
Because I left her in Chicago.

03:48.960 --> 03:51.247
Kinda why me and Chandra
called it quits,

03:51.320 --> 03:53.209
'cause she didn't want kids. I'm like...

03:53.320 --> 03:54.321
Oh, yeah?

03:54.400 --> 03:58.849
"I do. So, I'm leaving."
And then I left her. So, that's...

03:59.160 --> 04:01.640
But, yeah, you know,
I tried to tell her,

04:02.000 --> 04:04.685
children are the future.

04:05.000 --> 04:06.286
Look at that little
artist we got here.

04:06.360 --> 04:09.011
I'm done with my card, too.

04:09.280 --> 04:10.930
Yeah...

04:11.000 --> 04:13.048
Yeah, Merry Christmas.

04:13.120 --> 04:15.441
Happy fucking Holidays.

04:15.520 --> 04:16.521
Festive.

04:16.800 --> 04:18.370
Yoga retreat? Is that what you said?

04:18.440 --> 04:20.442
Yeah. It's a week-long yoga retreat.

04:20.720 --> 04:23.200
- You're here for rehab, right?
- No, I'm not here for rehab!

04:23.280 --> 04:25.681
- Let's be honest. Just call it what it is.
- I'm here for a yoga retreat!

04:25.760 --> 04:28.286
Vodka? Vermouth? What's your poison?

04:28.360 --> 04:30.442
It's just yoga. And I thought
it'd be nice to come up here

04:30.520 --> 04:32.170
and stay with these guys
for a week 'cause I miss them.

04:32.240 --> 04:34.083
Kids love those.
Yeah, man. Check it out.

04:34.160 --> 04:36.128
Oh, my God.
This is our dad's old...

04:36.200 --> 04:37.611
- Santa suit.
- Santa suit.

04:37.680 --> 04:39.967
- I've added a little number...
- Yeah?

04:40.040 --> 04:41.804
- ...to the costume.
- Oh!

04:41.880 --> 04:43.530
No,
that's terrifying.

04:43.600 --> 04:45.284
- What?
- That's terrifying.

04:45.360 --> 04:47.761
- It's jolly. He's a rosy red...
- He's angry.

04:47.840 --> 04:49.649
Look at all the creases on his forehead.

04:49.720 --> 04:52.291
He has a beard.
I thought it would be magic.

04:52.360 --> 04:54.408
He does have a beard. It looks...

04:54.520 --> 04:55.806
We might wanna run this by Em.

04:55.880 --> 04:57.882
- You guys ready?
- Your dad will get electrocuted.

04:57.960 --> 04:59.086
- Wait for it.
- Okay, step back.

04:59.160 --> 05:00.844
Wait for it.

05:00.920 --> 05:01.921
- This is lovely.
- Leila, you gotta

05:02.000 --> 05:03.764
tie it in a knot now,
tie it in a Christmas knot.

05:03.920 --> 05:05.120
She's really got an eye.

05:05.360 --> 05:07.362
I know I say this every year.

05:07.600 --> 05:08.886
No, you don't.

05:08.960 --> 05:11.080
We missed a couple...
We missed a couple years, right?

05:11.360 --> 05:14.045
My grandmother gave it to my mom.

05:14.360 --> 05:15.691
Your grandma.

05:15.960 --> 05:18.201
And your grandma gave it to me.

05:18.280 --> 05:19.566
And you will have it one day.

05:19.640 --> 05:20.926
- You got it?
- Mmm-hmm.

05:22.360 --> 05:24.010
Oh, Em,
that angel is gorgeous.

05:24.080 --> 05:25.206
Yeah!

05:25.280 --> 05:27.806
That was awesome!
Give me a high five.

05:36.360 --> 05:37.885
I love her so much.

05:38.720 --> 05:39.926
Okay.

05:43.800 --> 05:45.564
I think I'm done over here, buddy.

05:46.880 --> 05:50.601
Yeah, yeah, it's...
Well, it's not abstract.

05:50.960 --> 05:52.883
I think it's Christmassy.

05:53.160 --> 05:54.730
Looks great.
It'll look great in the front yard.

05:54.800 --> 05:55.847
Yeah!

05:55.920 --> 05:57.001
The neighbors will love it.

05:57.240 --> 06:01.086
It's just two robust
reindeer going at it.

06:01.240 --> 06:04.050
- Two boys going at it.
- Hey, bud, no judgment.

06:04.120 --> 06:05.281
Why don't you actually
do some real work?

06:05.360 --> 06:06.771
- Go grab me a...
- You did a great job!

06:06.840 --> 06:08.524
There's a string of lights
in that box over there.

06:08.600 --> 06:11.604
This box? This is just caulk.

06:11.680 --> 06:12.761
What?

06:13.920 --> 06:15.160
It's caulk.

06:15.240 --> 06:16.680
I think you got the wrong box.

06:18.240 --> 06:19.605
What is that?

06:22.240 --> 06:24.083
That must be
from the people who used to live here.

06:24.160 --> 06:26.162
- There's tapes in here, too.
- What?

06:27.080 --> 06:29.082
- There's tapes in here, too.
- Seriously?

06:35.600 --> 06:37.602
Ha! It's working.

06:40.600 --> 06:41.965
Nice.

06:44.040 --> 06:46.042
Wow, this is creepy.

06:52.360 --> 06:53.725
Too far.

06:55.960 --> 06:56.961
Focused.

07:00.720 --> 07:05.408
Ladies and gentleman,
award-winning cameraman...

07:06.040 --> 07:07.804
It's so big!

07:08.120 --> 07:10.407
- ...from outer space...
- What is that?

07:10.640 --> 07:12.165
Daddy!

07:12.400 --> 07:14.721
How do you hold that?
That is huge.

07:14.880 --> 07:17.087
- It's so big!
- "It's so big!"

07:17.160 --> 07:18.446
You look so funny.

07:18.520 --> 07:20.488
- People carried that?
- Yeah.

07:20.800 --> 07:22.723
This is cool. We own this.

07:22.800 --> 07:24.131
Look at our box.

07:24.200 --> 07:25.531
Yeah, it's cool.

07:25.840 --> 07:27.171
Hey, this thing is like...

07:27.400 --> 07:28.606
I don't know if it's out of focus or what,

07:28.680 --> 07:31.081
but it's kinda like
picking up some trippy...

07:31.240 --> 07:32.685
That thing is ancient.

07:32.760 --> 07:33.966
Like these trails on the lights.

07:34.040 --> 07:37.965
I'm seeing some sort of
odd shape in the middle of the room.

07:38.040 --> 07:40.327
Some sort of blurry thing.

07:40.680 --> 07:42.523
I think it's out of focus.

07:43.840 --> 07:45.922
This thing is so Wild.

07:46.160 --> 07:48.003
- Oh, this is so weird.
- What?

07:48.080 --> 07:50.160
I'm seeing something
in the middle of the room.

07:51.160 --> 07:53.208
It's probably just old.

07:57.520 --> 07:59.841
It's bizarre. It's like a...

08:03.760 --> 08:05.524
It's so weird.

08:05.880 --> 08:09.521
It sounded like I was underwater
when I walked into this thing.

08:10.680 --> 08:12.728
What is that?

08:18.880 --> 08:21.042
What is this camera picking up?

08:21.280 --> 08:22.611
Hey, Mom. Got it.

08:22.680 --> 08:25.809
She talked about it
the entire way home. She loved it.

08:31.480 --> 08:34.404
Mike is going to flip over this.

08:34.840 --> 08:36.284
All right, sweetie.

08:36.400 --> 08:38.402
You forgot to check.

08:38.960 --> 08:40.121
Oh!

08:40.240 --> 08:43.083
Bird is guarding the closet.
I'm gonna go in here.

08:43.400 --> 08:44.925
Okay. Closet looks good.

08:45.080 --> 08:46.570
Under the bed.

08:47.240 --> 08:49.720
I don't see anything, except for you.

08:49.920 --> 08:52.366
- I don't see a teepee.
- I don't see a teepee.

08:52.600 --> 08:53.726
The teepee.

08:53.880 --> 08:56.200
- There's no teepee in your room.
- You mean the pink tent?

08:56.560 --> 08:57.925
We're all clear in here.

08:58.080 --> 09:00.765
Wait. One last thing.
Will you hold this for a bit?

09:00.920 --> 09:02.206
This thing is heavy!

09:02.280 --> 09:03.850
Sleep tight. Sweet dreams.

09:03.920 --> 09:05.445
I can't wait for Santa to come.

09:05.760 --> 09:07.171
You can't? Well, you know what?

09:07.240 --> 09:10.244
He gives extra presents
to little girls who go to sleep.

09:10.440 --> 09:12.647
- Night, baby. Love you.
- Night, Mommy.

09:15.560 --> 09:17.085
Where did it go?

09:17.440 --> 09:20.125
Ryan? Are you coming to bed?

09:20.280 --> 09:22.200
I can't see
the thing anymore. I think it's gone.

09:22.280 --> 09:23.725
Well, that's awesome.
You fixed it.

09:23.800 --> 09:25.211
You can come to bed.
Play with that tomorrow.

09:25.280 --> 09:27.044
No, I didn't fix anything.

09:27.120 --> 09:30.966
We went upstairs, came back,
and now it's completely gone.

09:31.040 --> 09:34.169
If you come to bed right now,
your wife is gonna have sex with you.

09:34.240 --> 09:35.571
Sex?

09:35.640 --> 09:39.804
That's right.
I will have sex with you.

09:39.960 --> 09:42.122
Oh!

09:42.440 --> 09:43.965
That was supposed to be sexy.

09:44.280 --> 09:45.645
It's okay! Stay in the mood!

09:47.120 --> 09:50.488
This thing is absolutely sick.

09:50.800 --> 09:52.131
It looks pretty sick.

09:52.320 --> 09:53.924
- The thing is...
- You find anything?

09:54.000 --> 09:55.161
...it's completely custom.

09:55.480 --> 09:57.767
I mean, I've been to 15 websites.

09:57.840 --> 09:59.524
Nothing looks like this camera.

09:59.600 --> 10:02.649
- Traditionally, it has three picture tubes.
- Uh-huh.

10:03.800 --> 10:06.007
- This one has six.
- Oh, my God.

10:06.080 --> 10:08.242
It seems like this has
multiple focus rings.

10:08.360 --> 10:10.169
Like, I see "Iris" and "Focus,"

10:10.240 --> 10:11.890
- but this one right here?
- Yeah.

10:12.000 --> 10:13.729
I have no idea what this does.

10:13.840 --> 10:15.600
Why are you so into this?
It's just a camera.

10:15.640 --> 10:17.290
I don't know.
It's sitting in my house.

10:17.360 --> 10:19.010
I've never seen any of this before.

10:19.080 --> 10:21.321
I mean, this box?
I've never seen it before, Mike.

10:27.000 --> 10:28.843
This guy.

10:29.160 --> 10:31.686
I definitely picked something up.

10:32.120 --> 10:33.121
That's trippy.

10:39.360 --> 10:40.361
Wow.

10:56.040 --> 10:59.362
Okay. Can Mommy
and Daddy come?

10:59.720 --> 11:01.210
What is this...

11:06.000 --> 11:07.729
- Hey, Dad.
- Hey.

11:11.160 --> 11:12.525
Is this the same thing?

11:12.680 --> 11:14.842
- Who were you talking to?
- My friend.

11:15.160 --> 11:17.686
Your friend? Where's your friend?

11:23.400 --> 11:25.243
Dad. I want to play
hide-and-seek.

11:25.320 --> 11:27.971
- Count to 10! Count to 10!
- Okay.

11:29.840 --> 11:33.811
One, two, three...

11:37.200 --> 11:38.281
Where'd it go?

11:38.400 --> 11:40.050
Right. The girls are out tonight.

11:40.120 --> 11:41.167
We got the house to ourselves.

11:41.240 --> 11:42.526
Why don't we take the night off?

11:42.600 --> 11:44.560
I got to get this game out
before Christmas break.

11:44.760 --> 11:46.728
I was going through my bag.

11:47.040 --> 11:48.804
Yeah? What'd you find?
Dirty underwear?

11:48.880 --> 11:51.042
I found a souvenir
from my Belgium trip.

11:51.120 --> 11:54.647
This is fine Belgian chocolate
wrapped up in a piece of foil?

11:54.720 --> 11:56.165
Trust me, it doesn't
look like much.

11:56.240 --> 11:57.571
It's been in your pocket for a week?

11:57.640 --> 11:58.920
It's not about the presentation.

11:58.960 --> 12:00.689
They put a lot of
time into the chocolate.

12:00.760 --> 12:03.127
Ryan, seriously, I know why you
would expect that from me.

12:03.280 --> 12:05.282
- And I appreciate it.
- I know you pretty well.

12:05.400 --> 12:07.129
I've been living with
you for a long time.

12:07.240 --> 12:10.403
Fair enough.
I swear to God, it's not an edible.

12:21.400 --> 12:23.562
He's talking to me.

12:24.000 --> 12:27.607
Santa's the boss, man.
He's got a jolly attitude.

12:27.680 --> 12:30.570
One night he only has to work,
and he's flying around in his sleigh

12:30.640 --> 12:32.563
- with the magic reindeer.
- Mike, I just...

12:32.640 --> 12:35.211
Sign me up, man.
I wish I could be like Santa.

12:35.280 --> 12:38.011
Why do you still have
a VHS cassette player?

12:38.120 --> 12:40.487
Did I ever tell you
that I stole Dad's old pornos.

12:41.400 --> 12:43.687
And I was like,
"I need a way to watch these,"

12:43.760 --> 12:45.489
so I got a VCR.

12:45.800 --> 12:47.404
He had so many
weird, European...

12:47.480 --> 12:50.006
He has one where this guy
wraps his balls in leather.

12:50.120 --> 12:51.281
Do you know about the Internet?

12:51.360 --> 12:53.283
They all from '88 to '92?

12:53.360 --> 12:55.806
I don't know.
Let's see what we got here.

12:58.160 --> 12:59.400
Sit back.

12:59.640 --> 13:01.165
That's not your house, man.
Where is this?

13:01.280 --> 13:02.770
I don't know, dude.

13:02.840 --> 13:04.842
- 1988.
- 1988. Oh!

13:05.120 --> 13:06.565
<i>There she is.</i>

13:06.680 --> 13:09.763
- There she is!
- This is gonna be so hot.

13:09.960 --> 13:12.361
- What is this?
- What are we watching?

13:13.120 --> 13:14.963
Oh, my God.

13:16.480 --> 13:18.050
Oh, those shoulders.

13:18.120 --> 13:19.645
I'm a shoulder guy, apparently.

13:21.120 --> 13:22.485
This is where it gets real good.

13:22.560 --> 13:25.325
Don't cry. Don't cry.

13:26.800 --> 13:28.086
Go back... Where'd your mom go?

13:28.200 --> 13:29.440
<i>Hi!</i>

13:29.920 --> 13:31.285
Bye!

13:32.040 --> 13:34.930
This sucks. Tell me
when the lady comes back.

13:35.320 --> 13:36.401
I'll put in another tape.

13:36.520 --> 13:38.363
Yeah. Look for one
marked "Shoulders."

13:38.440 --> 13:40.090
Fellas, how's the game going?

13:40.640 --> 13:42.165
Who's winning?

13:42.680 --> 13:45.331
Why aren't you guys talking to me?

13:45.400 --> 13:46.845
I'm one of you!

13:47.040 --> 13:50.283
Whoa! Ryan, I think this...

13:51.840 --> 13:53.285
This is wild, man.

13:53.360 --> 13:55.761
Hey, Mike!
Next one's up and ready.

13:55.880 --> 13:57.370
Give me some shoulder.

13:57.680 --> 13:59.011
Check this out.

13:59.160 --> 14:01.162
<i>You sure you're up for this?</i>

14:01.720 --> 14:05.247
Uh... Oh, my God, this is perfect!

14:06.480 --> 14:07.606
Uh-huh.

14:07.680 --> 14:09.409
<i>It's an earthquake.</i>

14:09.520 --> 14:10.851
<i>- Holy shit!
- Dennis, it's an earthquake!</i>

14:10.920 --> 14:12.445
No, no, no!

14:12.880 --> 14:14.405
What is this?

14:14.480 --> 14:16.209
How about "Opening Doors"?

14:16.280 --> 14:17.850
Did they just film everything?

14:17.960 --> 14:19.644
This could be a porn.

14:19.720 --> 14:20.960
- Okay.
- Think about it.

14:21.160 --> 14:23.845
<i>Focus, Kristi.
Don't use your eyes to see.</i>

14:23.920 --> 14:25.763
<i>- Use what's inside you.</i>
- Okay.

14:25.920 --> 14:30.005
This is a little different.
What, is he hypnotizing her?

14:30.080 --> 14:32.082
<i>Concentrate, Kristi.</i>

14:33.880 --> 14:35.211
<i>I need you to concentrate.</i>

14:35.280 --> 14:36.640
Concentrate on what, Kristi?

14:36.680 --> 14:38.409
<i>You see through him, Kristi.</i>

14:38.600 --> 14:40.682
<i>Let him show you what he sees.</i>

14:40.760 --> 14:42.000
What the...

14:42.240 --> 14:43.730
<i>Let him take you there.</i>

14:46.200 --> 14:47.884
<i>Let him show you.</i>

14:48.440 --> 14:49.601
I hate this family.

14:49.680 --> 14:51.489
<i>There's a room.</i>

14:52.280 --> 14:53.361
Is this girl...

14:53.440 --> 14:55.442
- Is she just taking minutes?
- Yeah.

14:55.520 --> 14:56.601
For the meeting?

14:58.560 --> 15:00.961
<i>There's lots of colors.</i>

15:01.920 --> 15:04.082
I'm seeing colors, too, buddy.

15:05.960 --> 15:08.281
<i>There's butterflies.</i>

15:08.360 --> 15:10.931
<i>There's a big bird over the door.</i>

15:11.320 --> 15:12.970
<i>What's so funny?</i>

15:13.760 --> 15:15.410
<i>There's a tent.</i>

15:15.760 --> 15:17.046
<i>A tent?</i>

15:17.120 --> 15:18.360
What?

15:19.880 --> 15:21.211
What? Ryan?

15:21.280 --> 15:23.965
<i>Like the one me and Katie camp out in.</i>

15:28.520 --> 15:30.921
<i>It's right in the little girl's room.</i>

15:31.960 --> 15:33.450
Why are you looking at me like that?

15:33.600 --> 15:35.250
<i>Why would it be in
the middle of the room?</i>

15:35.320 --> 15:36.810
- Come on.
- What am I missing?

15:36.920 --> 15:38.160
The tent in the middle of the room?

15:38.240 --> 15:40.971
Butterflies? A bird above the door?

15:41.040 --> 15:42.485
Does this sound like anything?

15:42.640 --> 15:43.926
Uh... Boredom?

15:44.000 --> 15:46.571
She just described Leila's room!

15:46.640 --> 15:48.483
Oh, my God, man,
you're so fucking high!

15:48.600 --> 15:49.931
Mike, she's describing Leila's room.

15:50.000 --> 15:51.240
Did you eat more
chocolate than I did?

15:51.400 --> 15:53.323
<i>Is he there, Kristi?</i>

15:55.160 --> 15:56.810
Ryan, come on, man,
turn this off. What are...

15:56.880 --> 15:58.006
Shh!

15:59.640 --> 16:03.645
<i>Is he in the room?
Is he in the house?</i>

16:06.040 --> 16:07.724
<i>Do you see him?</i>

16:08.400 --> 16:09.811
Why is he making her do this?

16:09.880 --> 16:11.530
Who's "him"?

16:16.960 --> 16:18.644
<i>He's there!</i>

16:19.520 --> 16:21.090
Whoa! Did you trip a switch?

16:21.160 --> 16:23.049
No, seriously,
I didn't trip a switch.

16:23.160 --> 16:25.891
What did we do, blow a fuse
firing up that old VCR?

16:26.000 --> 16:28.321
Okay, they're back. That was strange.

16:28.400 --> 16:30.926
Yeah.

16:31.000 --> 16:32.968
- Did you hear that?
- Uh. yeah.

16:33.040 --> 16:34.040
Come with me.

16:34.080 --> 16:35.081
Take your camera.
Go check it out yourself.

16:35.160 --> 16:36.161
All right, fine. Here.

16:38.480 --> 16:41.723
Concentrate.
I want you to focus, Ryan.

16:41.800 --> 16:43.131
Dude, shut up.

16:43.200 --> 16:45.282
That's Ponytail.
Do you get what I'm doing?

16:45.400 --> 16:47.600
Wait. Is that the same
stuff from the other night?

16:49.680 --> 16:51.409
What's it doing?

16:54.040 --> 16:56.202
Where did it go?

17:10.800 --> 17:11.925
Mike?

17:14.400 --> 17:15.765
Mike?

17:19.119 --> 17:21.599
Mike, it's not funny. Is that you?

17:34.080 --> 17:37.289
Holy shit.

17:45.600 --> 17:48.729
Goal!

17:48.800 --> 17:50.370
"Mike?"

17:50.440 --> 17:53.205
- "Mike, is that you?" "Mike?"
- Oh, my God!

17:53.600 --> 17:55.170
You scared the shit out of me.

17:57.800 --> 17:59.245
Ryan, I think...

17:59.920 --> 18:02.810
This is crazy.
I think my camera is starting to see...

18:03.120 --> 18:04.849
I think I'm seeing something.

18:05.520 --> 18:06.851
It's a...

18:07.480 --> 18:09.005
It's a dipshit!

18:09.320 --> 18:10.685
Do you see the dipshit, man?

18:10.800 --> 18:14.646
There's, like, particles of
dipshit in your aura, man.

18:15.280 --> 18:16.770
It's right around your...

18:17.080 --> 18:18.969
You're the dipshit, Ryan.

18:19.040 --> 18:20.644
I'm calling you a dipshit.

18:20.800 --> 18:22.131
Oh, they're here! Hey!

18:23.320 --> 18:25.129
- Hey, babe!
- Oh, Jesus!

18:25.200 --> 18:26.281
That's Uncle Mike.

18:26.360 --> 18:28.601
That's not a very good...

18:28.680 --> 18:30.250
- Hold on a second.
- Mustache.

18:30.320 --> 18:31.481
A big pile of...

18:31.560 --> 18:32.840
That's not a very good likeness.

18:32.880 --> 18:34.530
So, what exactly do you do again?

18:34.600 --> 18:36.568
It's kind of like feng shui.

18:36.640 --> 18:37.801
I move the furniture around

18:37.880 --> 18:40.804
so that, you know,
it's not blocking the energy.

18:40.880 --> 18:43.326
Which I should probably
do with your house.

18:43.840 --> 18:45.524
- Really? Why?
- Yeah.

18:45.600 --> 18:47.090
It just feels a little different.

18:47.160 --> 18:48.730
Is your energy blocked, Mike?

18:50.160 --> 18:51.321
Mike's energy?

18:51.440 --> 18:52.441
I'm flowing nicely.

18:52.520 --> 18:55.364
If you want to relieve
some sort of blockage...

18:56.520 --> 18:58.010
I don't know what we're
talking about anymore.

18:58.080 --> 19:00.287
Tell her about the night
we had last night.

19:00.560 --> 19:02.961
Oh, I've just kind of been

19:04.000 --> 19:06.526
seeing and hearing some strange things.

19:12.040 --> 19:13.724
You know, I've heard of
spirit photography before,

19:13.880 --> 19:16.042
but I've never actually seen it in person.

19:17.360 --> 19:19.089
What kind of stuff have you been seeing?

19:19.200 --> 19:20.531
Just shapes.

19:20.720 --> 19:22.370
It could be a spirit of some kind.

19:22.720 --> 19:24.051
But most of the time, these cameras,

19:24.160 --> 19:26.367
they don't pick up on beings as much as,

19:26.560 --> 19:28.449
different planes of existence.

19:28.560 --> 19:30.722
Somewhere where
a lot of displaced energy

19:30.840 --> 19:32.205
would travel to.

19:33.000 --> 19:35.731
But, you know, sometimes
it's just a camera glitch.

19:36.040 --> 19:37.121
I don't know.

19:37.200 --> 19:39.043
It's weird,
but I don't think this is a glitch.

19:39.120 --> 19:40.645
I saw it in Leila's room,

19:40.720 --> 19:43.291
and then last night it was in the hall.

19:45.240 --> 19:46.526
Guys, Leila's asleep.

19:46.600 --> 19:48.728
We're taking off, okay?
Should be back around 11:00.

19:48.800 --> 19:50.006
- Good night.
- Hey.

19:50.080 --> 19:52.082
Be careful with that camera. Seriously.

19:52.200 --> 19:53.281
Relax, Ryan.

19:53.360 --> 19:54.691
I just want to see
what this thing does.

19:54.920 --> 19:57.440
Sky, you don't
really think that thing sees ghosts, right?

19:57.560 --> 19:59.767
Yeah, I think
it's totally possible.

19:59.920 --> 20:01.081
What?

20:03.080 --> 20:06.641
Whoa! The lights look
so cool with this thing.

20:06.720 --> 20:08.240
You should
see that on mushrooms.

20:08.280 --> 20:10.009
Yeah, I'm gonna
need some wine.

20:10.960 --> 20:12.166
Oh...

20:12.240 --> 20:13.924
Okay. Um...

20:14.560 --> 20:16.085
- Red? White?
- Like, rosé.

20:16.240 --> 20:18.242
Cabernet Sauvi...

20:18.920 --> 20:20.285
I think there's...

21:12.320 --> 21:15.802
Hello? Is somebody there?

21:23.480 --> 21:25.289
- Hey.
- Jesus, you scared me.

21:25.360 --> 21:27.761
It's just me.
It's just me. I got the <i>vino.</i>

21:27.840 --> 21:29.410
I think something's here.

21:29.480 --> 21:31.323
- What?
- I think I felt something.

21:31.560 --> 21:32.641
Okay.

21:32.720 --> 21:35.371
Yeah, I looked through
the camera, but didn't see anything.

21:35.680 --> 21:36.761
That's a timer.

21:36.840 --> 21:39.446
Hold on, I think there's
a night-vision thing.

21:40.000 --> 21:41.490
Oh, there it is.

21:45.000 --> 21:46.081
What?

21:48.200 --> 21:50.362
Probably just the wind.

21:51.640 --> 21:53.324
Do you see anything?

21:53.520 --> 21:54.851
No.

22:05.200 --> 22:06.361
Mike, what do you see?

22:06.480 --> 22:07.920
Let's go back inside. Come on.

22:16.840 --> 22:18.171
What the hell is that?

22:18.360 --> 22:19.646
Fuck! Something just
flew out of the pool!

22:19.720 --> 22:21.290
Mike, quiet. You're gonna scare it.

22:21.400 --> 22:22.840
Fuck that! I'm gonna scare it?

22:23.040 --> 22:24.371
Skyler.

22:28.240 --> 22:29.920
Let me see the camera.

22:30.400 --> 22:32.402
Whoa, what is this?

22:35.480 --> 22:37.482
Mike, there's something here.

22:40.920 --> 22:42.922
This is so crazy.

22:52.520 --> 22:53.760
Leila!

22:54.920 --> 22:56.331
Leila, honey,

22:56.400 --> 22:58.402
what are you doing
out here, sweetie? It's cold.

23:00.080 --> 23:01.605
Let's go inside.

23:01.760 --> 23:03.091
It's cold, sweetie.

23:03.200 --> 23:04.770
Yeah, let's get you inside.

23:12.920 --> 23:14.410
What the hell?

23:17.080 --> 23:18.081
Fuck.

23:19.560 --> 23:21.289
The stuff with the pool was weird.

23:21.400 --> 23:23.209
But she was way more
scared of it than I was.

23:23.280 --> 23:24.361
Yeah.

23:24.440 --> 23:26.727
I mean, maybe we
saw something, but the camera's janky.

23:26.840 --> 23:28.440
We were coming
around the corner,

23:28.480 --> 23:30.403
we turned and she was just
standing there.

23:30.560 --> 23:32.449
Did you ask her
why she was here?

23:32.760 --> 23:34.046
She was like comatose.

23:34.120 --> 23:35.485
I don't know if she heard us.

23:35.600 --> 23:36.647
It was like she was sleepwalking.

23:36.760 --> 23:38.046
I don't know what she was doing.

23:38.120 --> 23:40.202
She's not a sleepwalker.
She sleeps real soundly.

23:40.280 --> 23:41.560
Hey, guys, look at this.

23:43.240 --> 23:44.480
There's a hole in there.

23:45.120 --> 23:47.600
- Are these yours?
- God, yeah!

23:48.800 --> 23:50.484
It's my rosary.

23:51.320 --> 23:52.367
That's so weird.

23:52.440 --> 23:55.046
Did you see her
burying this stuff out here last night?

23:55.160 --> 23:57.811
No, I didn't see her, but it's possible.

24:02.360 --> 24:03.407
What are you doing?

24:03.480 --> 24:05.244
You know how Daddy's got a new toy.

24:05.320 --> 24:06.367
Mmm-hmm.

24:06.440 --> 24:08.044
Kind of like you have all these toys.

24:08.160 --> 24:09.161
Yeah.

24:09.680 --> 24:11.842
Well, Daddy's new toy

24:12.440 --> 24:14.807
saw something very
interesting last night.

24:15.160 --> 24:17.322
I just... I just...

24:20.800 --> 24:24.327
You just... Did you feel something?

24:25.120 --> 24:27.361
I don't want to talk about him.

24:29.000 --> 24:30.490
Who's "him," babe?

24:32.560 --> 24:33.561
Uh...

24:35.680 --> 24:37.842
<i>Kristi, what are you doing?</i>

24:38.200 --> 24:40.043
What this button does...

24:40.160 --> 24:42.049
<i>Go back to bed. It's really late.</i>

24:48.880 --> 24:52.089
"Spirit photography is something that..."

25:08.840 --> 25:10.001
Hello?

25:29.040 --> 25:30.041
Hello?

25:35.040 --> 25:36.201
Hello?

25:41.240 --> 25:43.242
I don't know. Maybe I'm going crazy.

26:43.160 --> 26:45.322
Yram ydoolb.

26:46.000 --> 26:49.482
Yram ydoolb.

26:49.640 --> 26:51.165
Lee? What are you
doing in here?

26:51.440 --> 26:53.647
Yram ydoolb.

26:57.600 --> 27:00.285
Lee? Honey, is that blood?

27:01.160 --> 27:03.811
What's on your hand, sweetie?
You're bleeding.

27:04.320 --> 27:05.845
What happened?

27:06.160 --> 27:07.650
Honey, answer me. What happened?

27:07.720 --> 27:08.801
You're bleeding.

27:23.200 --> 27:25.680
<i>Yram ydoolb.</i>

27:26.360 --> 27:28.522
<i>Yram ydoolb.</i>

27:30.800 --> 27:31.847
What is she saying?

27:34.360 --> 27:36.044
I don't know.

27:36.480 --> 27:38.881
<i>Bloody Mary.</i>

27:39.200 --> 27:41.362
<i>Bloody Mary.</i>

27:41.680 --> 27:43.170
Did you hear that?

27:43.720 --> 27:45.324
Is she talking backwards?

27:45.400 --> 27:46.731
Is she saying, "Bloody Mary"?

27:46.880 --> 27:48.120
What's Bloody Mary?

27:48.200 --> 27:50.680
- It's a game kids play.
- What kind of game?

27:50.760 --> 27:52.888
Originally in the game,
you say it three times

27:53.040 --> 27:56.203
and a witch appears and shows you
who you're supposed to marry.

27:56.360 --> 27:58.966
But when I used to play it,
the way most kids play it,

27:59.040 --> 28:00.405
you say "Bloody Mary" three times

28:00.480 --> 28:02.960
and a bloody witch appears
and grabs you by the neck.

28:03.040 --> 28:04.565
How would Leila know about this game?

28:04.680 --> 28:06.250
There's no way.

28:06.560 --> 28:08.562
How old were you when you played it?

28:09.560 --> 28:12.086
I don't know. I was young.
Maybe her friends showed her.

28:13.720 --> 28:15.085
- Go, man.
- Mike, what?

28:15.240 --> 28:16.969
Check it out. Check it out, man.

28:17.080 --> 28:19.128
I cracked the case.
Right by the ferns, look.

28:19.240 --> 28:20.366
They lived here?

28:20.440 --> 28:23.489
They must've, right?
Why else would it be there? 1987?

28:23.560 --> 28:25.642
So, this is the same house
where they filmed all that weird shit.

28:25.720 --> 28:28.200
Whole place burned down in '92.

28:28.280 --> 28:29.930
No bodies were recovered.

28:30.600 --> 28:33.604
Says the whole family just
disappeared, including...

28:33.920 --> 28:35.922
Including their daughters,
Katie and Kristi.

28:36.040 --> 28:38.361
So, you think our daughter

28:38.440 --> 28:41.922
is talking to a ghost?

28:42.240 --> 28:44.402
Leila's been getting up at night
and playing with something

28:44.480 --> 28:46.926
that only she and
this camera can see.

28:47.040 --> 28:48.121
Kids do weird things.

28:48.200 --> 28:49.531
It doesn't mean the house is haunted.

28:49.600 --> 28:51.250
The people who
lived here 20 years ago,

28:51.320 --> 28:53.766
they put up cameras
and caught all kinds of things.

28:53.960 --> 28:55.962
And our house is built on top of theirs.

28:56.040 --> 28:58.200
- Did Mike put you up to this?
- No. Look, look...

28:58.240 --> 28:59.480
I feel like every time he comes over,

28:59.600 --> 29:01.887
you guys find some crazy thing
that you wanna do.

29:01.960 --> 29:03.840
No, honey, it's not
like that at all. I promise.

29:03.880 --> 29:05.920
I just want to see if there
really is something here

29:05.960 --> 29:07.962
or if I'm just crazy.

29:08.280 --> 29:09.884
Look, I'll feel better either way.

29:09.960 --> 29:11.803
- Fine. Do it.
- Yes? I can do it?

29:12.080 --> 29:14.526
Yes, you can do it. For a few days, Ryan.

29:16.920 --> 29:19.002
All right, Mike.
That should just about do it.

29:19.240 --> 29:20.605
Two cameras in here?

29:20.760 --> 29:22.240
Yeah, well,
this other one's a control

29:22.320 --> 29:24.607
to see if this one's
picking up something special.

29:25.680 --> 29:27.091
And we'll put the other one on the desk.

29:27.280 --> 29:29.080
So we can watch
your daughter sleep all night.

29:29.120 --> 29:30.360
Nothing weird about that.

29:32.640 --> 29:34.608
"And she said, 'Sarah, Ashley,

29:34.680 --> 29:36.523
"'I've never seen you
look more beautiful.'

29:37.360 --> 29:39.328
"And they turned
and looked at their mom and waved

29:39.400 --> 29:43.086
"and said, 'Thanks, Mom.
We've never felt more beautiful.'

29:44.280 --> 29:45.441
"The end."

29:48.960 --> 29:50.371
Good night, sweetheart.

30:00.200 --> 30:01.531
- Mommy.
Mmm-hmm?

30:01.600 --> 30:03.523
- Did I die?
- What?

30:03.600 --> 30:05.011
When I was a baby?

30:06.000 --> 30:08.241
No. Who did you hear that from?

30:08.880 --> 30:09.880
I don't know.

30:09.920 --> 30:13.083
Well, there was
a cord in Mommy's tummy

30:13.840 --> 30:15.569
and it got wrapped around your neck,

30:15.680 --> 30:17.523
and the doctors got scared

30:17.600 --> 30:20.490
because it made it hard
for you to breathe.

30:20.560 --> 30:22.608
So, they went in there real quick
and they got you out.

30:22.680 --> 30:24.205
And there's nothing wrong with you.

30:24.280 --> 30:27.090
So there's nothing
to be worried about. Okay?

30:27.360 --> 30:28.361
Okay.

30:28.880 --> 30:30.560
'Cause you're our little miracle.

30:31.320 --> 30:34.210
And I love you. Okay?

30:34.360 --> 30:35.361
Mmm.

32:44.440 --> 32:47.046
- I'm so sorry. Right. Uh-huh.
- What's going on?

32:48.880 --> 32:50.211
Right. Okay.

32:50.520 --> 32:51.931
Well, I'm gonna be there in 15 minutes.

32:52.000 --> 32:54.970
- She bit a kid.
- What? She bit a kid?

32:55.040 --> 32:57.611
Yeah. She bit a kid at school
and now I gotta go pick her up.

32:57.680 --> 32:59.091
- Is the kid all right?
- I don't know.

32:59.160 --> 33:00.161
He had to go to the hospital.

33:00.240 --> 33:01.844
I got to go pick her up now.
She can't stay at school.

33:01.920 --> 33:04.605
They told me it took
three teachers to pull her off of him.

33:04.680 --> 33:07.650
And then they were telling me
that the boy had to have stitches.

33:07.720 --> 33:09.802
Like, this kid had to get stitches
from our daughter.

33:09.880 --> 33:11.086
Maybe what the teacher said is right.

33:11.160 --> 33:14.243
Maybe we should send her
to a psychologist.

33:14.320 --> 33:16.004
She's not sleeping, Em.

33:16.080 --> 33:17.889
She's been really quiet.

33:17.960 --> 33:19.724
I mean, I'm worried about her.

34:55.280 --> 34:56.440
Okay.

35:04.280 --> 35:05.441
Okay.

35:09.440 --> 35:10.726
Where?

35:13.600 --> 35:15.440
Hey, sweetie,
what are you doing awake?

35:16.440 --> 35:18.124
It's cold in here.

35:19.480 --> 35:20.811
Get back under the covers.

35:23.800 --> 35:26.644
Let's get you tucked back in.
There you go.

35:26.960 --> 35:28.291
Just go back to sleep, okay?

36:07.480 --> 36:09.847
What was that?

36:10.320 --> 36:12.527
It was nothing. Okay, okay.

36:13.520 --> 36:15.727
Okay, sweetie.

36:15.840 --> 36:18.002
Why don't you lay down
and get some sleep?

36:20.160 --> 36:21.525
Just get some sleep.

36:36.000 --> 36:37.161
Hey, Lee.

36:37.320 --> 36:40.449
I saw something in your room last night
with you and Auntie Skyler.

36:42.400 --> 36:43.481
Honey?

36:43.880 --> 36:45.882
What woke you up last night?

36:47.040 --> 36:48.565
Tobi did it.

36:48.880 --> 36:50.530
Tobi did it?

36:51.560 --> 36:53.210
Who's Tobi?

36:54.840 --> 36:56.569
Leila, who's Tobi?

36:57.880 --> 36:59.166
Leila?

37:02.560 --> 37:06.167
It was this big, dark shape
and it was just floating around.

37:06.240 --> 37:08.242
And she called it Tobi.

37:08.520 --> 37:10.170
She's not scared of it at all.

37:10.240 --> 37:12.208
And I know you think
I'm losing my mind here,

37:12.280 --> 37:13.520
but I think it's our ghost.

37:13.840 --> 37:15.729
Emily thinks I'm nuts,
but remember I told you

37:15.840 --> 37:18.684
Leila said her friend
Tobi woke her up last night, right?

37:18.960 --> 37:20.689
- Yeah.
- Okay. Check this out.

37:20.800 --> 37:22.006
This tape is from 1988.

37:22.080 --> 37:24.082
<i>Don't sit there. That's Tobi's spot.</i>

37:24.760 --> 37:27.161
<i>Oh, sorry. Is Tobi
sitting there right now?</i>

37:27.240 --> 37:28.605
They're talking about Tobi.

37:28.760 --> 37:29.921
<i>Sony, Tobi.</i>

37:30.040 --> 37:31.041
Coincidence.

37:31.200 --> 37:33.931
Four years later, these girls
have grown up a little bit,

37:34.040 --> 37:36.008
- and we have Ponytail.
- Mmm.

37:36.080 --> 37:38.765
<i>Tobi's a very important part of your life.</i>

37:39.440 --> 37:40.566
<i>Right?</i>

37:40.920 --> 37:41.921
<i>Okay.</i>

37:42.760 --> 37:46.560
So, they stayed in touch
with Tobes. That was nice.

37:46.640 --> 37:47.687
No. Mike...

37:47.760 --> 37:49.649
Dude, this is before Facebook.

37:49.760 --> 37:51.125
It was hard to stay in touch with people.

37:51.280 --> 37:52.725
You think it's a guy or girl?

37:52.800 --> 37:54.370
Tobi would be a cool stripper name.

37:54.440 --> 37:55.521
Yeah.

37:55.600 --> 37:57.364
"Coming down to the main stage,

37:57.440 --> 38:00.125
"please welcome Tobi."

38:00.240 --> 38:01.890
I'm telling you, the camera's not busted.

38:01.960 --> 38:03.041
It's seeing something that's there.

38:03.120 --> 38:04.360
It's a piece of shit, dude.

38:04.440 --> 38:07.330
And besides,
Tobi is not a common name.

38:07.400 --> 38:08.845
She probably watched the tape.

38:08.920 --> 38:10.763
Mike, she's three feet tall.

38:10.840 --> 38:13.286
She has no idea even what a VCR is.

38:13.640 --> 38:16.246
She couldn't reach up there,
put it in and hit "play."

38:16.320 --> 38:17.890
And get the right tape.

38:17.960 --> 38:21.123
That makes me feel old.
Kids don't know what VCRs are?

38:24.360 --> 38:25.691
What was that?

38:27.480 --> 38:29.323
- Did you hear that?
- Yeah.

38:29.640 --> 38:30.840
- You did?
- Yeah, man.

38:30.920 --> 38:32.126
Are you seeing anything?

38:32.320 --> 38:33.401
Holy shit.

38:33.480 --> 38:34.641
What, are you
picking something up?

38:34.800 --> 38:36.325
- Dude.
- What?

38:36.640 --> 38:39.962
I think
it's the icemaker in the freezer!

38:41.160 --> 38:42.286
Does Tobi like ice?

38:42.360 --> 38:44.567
I think we should let him
out of the freezer, man.

38:44.640 --> 38:46.324
Probably why he's so ticked all the time.

38:46.480 --> 38:49.006
There's too much of a coincidence.
That's all I'm saying.

38:50.000 --> 38:51.206
Mike. Keep it down, man.

38:51.320 --> 38:52.321
Everyone's sleeping.

38:52.440 --> 38:54.488
The sound came
from out there, dude!

38:56.560 --> 38:58.320
Okay, give me the camera.
Give me the camera.

39:05.120 --> 39:07.088
Mike,
something's up there.

39:07.160 --> 39:08.650
It's different, though.

39:14.800 --> 39:16.325
It's moving. Mike, it's moving.

39:18.200 --> 39:20.680
Ryan, let's go.
We're gonna wake Leila.

39:21.000 --> 39:22.560
I just want to see where it went.

39:41.880 --> 39:43.211
Do you see anything?

39:47.560 --> 39:49.164
- No.
- I'm not picking anything up.

39:57.560 --> 39:58.891
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

39:59.520 --> 40:00.760
Ah... Jesus.

40:01.680 --> 40:03.045
What the hell, man?

40:03.360 --> 40:05.362
Daddy, what are you doing?

40:05.920 --> 40:07.922
I'm sorry, baby. I'm sorry. It's okay.

40:08.040 --> 40:09.883
Everything's okay, okay?
Just go back to sleep.

40:11.720 --> 40:13.051
I screamed because you screamed.

40:13.120 --> 40:14.485
You screamed so loud.

40:14.560 --> 40:17.803
You shouted near your sleeping
daughter's face, so I screamed.

40:17.880 --> 40:18.961
I couldn't see anything.

40:19.040 --> 40:20.690
- Know why I screamed?
- Why?

40:20.760 --> 40:22.922
Because I saw this through the camera.

40:23.000 --> 40:24.650
This seems more concentrated.

40:24.720 --> 40:26.927
It's got more form. It's darker.

40:27.240 --> 40:30.403
And, dude, I fucking
felt that thing fly past me.

40:30.480 --> 40:32.847
That looks like a face.
I mean, it's not human.

40:32.920 --> 40:34.604
But that's crazy, Mike.

40:34.680 --> 40:36.560
Why do you still need
two cameras in here?

40:36.760 --> 40:38.649
I just don't think
one camera can cover the whole room.

40:38.760 --> 40:41.047
It's talking to her
and telling her to do things,

40:41.120 --> 40:42.610
and it's not just in her room.

40:42.760 --> 40:45.286
It's moving all around the house.

40:47.760 --> 40:50.809
I just want to know where
it's going and what it wants.

40:50.880 --> 40:52.211
That's better.

42:11.520 --> 42:12.521
Now?

42:57.920 --> 43:02.005
Take me away. Take me away.

43:07.600 --> 43:09.762
Lee! Put those down!

43:09.920 --> 43:12.924
Put those down. Right now.
What are you doing?

43:14.600 --> 43:16.090
Did you turn the gas on?

43:16.280 --> 43:17.850
Leila, you cannot play with matches.

43:17.920 --> 43:19.649
You can't turn the gas on.

43:19.920 --> 43:21.081
What are you doing?

43:21.440 --> 43:23.010
Get back in bed. Okay.

43:25.600 --> 43:29.127
Don't play with matches.
It's the middle of the night.

44:52.480 --> 44:54.687
Ry? Ryan? Ryan.

44:59.840 --> 45:02.366
That Bible is my Bible from upstairs.

45:02.480 --> 45:04.209
It was in the fireplace.

45:05.360 --> 45:07.488
That's what she was trying to burn.

45:09.200 --> 45:10.804
The rosary that she tried to bury,

45:10.880 --> 45:12.166
it was also in the fireplace.

45:12.360 --> 45:13.885
She said she was playing a game.

45:14.200 --> 45:17.124
What kind of game can you
play with matches?

45:19.520 --> 45:21.363
She said she was
playing a game with Tobi.

45:21.560 --> 45:23.528
She just knew
you had the book up there.

45:23.600 --> 45:25.523
She probably doesn't know what it is.

45:26.040 --> 45:27.644
I don't know. I put her back to bed

45:27.720 --> 45:30.246
and then I come down here,
and then the angel falls.

45:31.400 --> 45:34.722
I don't know, it just...
it doesn't seem like her.

45:35.920 --> 45:38.400
It seems like she's different.

45:38.480 --> 45:40.642
I didn't want to believe it,
but I think Ryan's right.

45:40.720 --> 45:42.404
There is something in our house.

45:42.640 --> 45:44.927
Lee, I need you to tell me

45:45.000 --> 45:47.571
that you're gonna stop talking to Tobi.

45:50.920 --> 45:52.160
Lee?

45:52.680 --> 45:53.920
Lee, look at your mother.

45:54.040 --> 45:55.246
Can you look at me, please?

45:55.320 --> 45:57.163
Tobi is my friend.

45:58.680 --> 46:00.921
- Lee, he's not your friend.
- He is not... No.

46:01.240 --> 46:02.240
Okay?

46:02.320 --> 46:04.448
And Mommy and Daddy
don't want you talking to him anymore.

46:04.520 --> 46:07.000
Lee, promise us
you're gonna stop talking to Tobi.

46:08.360 --> 46:09.771
I promise.

46:10.120 --> 46:11.281
Good.

46:14.000 --> 46:16.401
So, the tapes start in '88.

46:17.200 --> 46:18.884
Lots of Katie and Kristi stuff.

46:18.960 --> 46:20.041
And they're living with their mom.

46:20.120 --> 46:21.360
- Shoulders!
- Right.

46:21.440 --> 46:23.363
<i>- Why does he need a bowl?
- He wants to eat.</i>

46:23.440 --> 46:25.363
I haven't gone
through all the tapes.

46:25.440 --> 46:27.124
But the footage suddenly jumps

46:27.200 --> 46:28.725
and everything is real different.

46:28.800 --> 46:30.723
- There's nothing in between?
- No.

46:30.800 --> 46:32.370
The mom and her boyfriend?

46:32.440 --> 46:34.886
They're completely absent in the footage.

46:35.880 --> 46:37.370
Like, nowhere?

46:37.480 --> 46:39.050
Not on any of the tapes.

46:39.120 --> 46:42.044
And this weird cult is taking care
of these girls now.

46:42.120 --> 46:44.043
And they're calling
this other woman Mom.

46:44.120 --> 46:45.565
Is that a milk bath?

46:45.880 --> 46:47.484
<i>I had one more dream.</i>

46:47.720 --> 46:49.165
Who are these people? Jesus.

46:49.400 --> 46:52.244
<i>It's just that
I had another mommy.</i>

46:53.080 --> 46:56.243
<i>And then she fell down
some sort of stairs.</i>

46:56.400 --> 46:58.004
<i>Tobi said you're on your way, sweetie.</i>

46:58.080 --> 46:59.570
<i>You're progressing nicely.</i>

46:59.640 --> 47:01.085
What does all this mean?

47:01.160 --> 47:03.640
I don't know.
But this guy is their leader

47:03.720 --> 47:06.564
and it's like he's preparing
the girls for something.

47:06.640 --> 47:08.244
<i>You'll make us so proud.</i>

47:08.400 --> 47:10.482
<i>He needs her.
We're getting close.</i>

47:40.200 --> 47:42.202
- Still watching tapes?
- Yeah.

47:42.680 --> 47:44.280
I just wanna see
if there's a connection.

47:44.680 --> 47:46.205
Didn't we watch this
the other night?

47:46.360 --> 47:47.440
No, it's a different night.

47:47.480 --> 47:49.721
But she's doing the same thing.

47:50.040 --> 47:52.884
They literally do this
every night. It's like a ritual.

47:52.960 --> 47:54.120
It's not a normal home video.

47:54.160 --> 47:56.083
It's like some sort of training tape.

47:56.200 --> 47:57.725
<i>Is he showing you?</i>

47:57.800 --> 47:59.723
<i>I'm not sure.</i>

48:00.040 --> 48:01.804
<i>It's too blurry.</i>

48:02.040 --> 48:03.565
<i>Just let him
show you what he sees.</i>

48:03.640 --> 48:04.880
<i>Let him guide you.</i>

48:05.040 --> 48:08.044
<i>I think I see food.</i>

48:08.560 --> 48:11.882
<i>Yeah, I'm pretty sure it's food.</i>

48:14.720 --> 48:16.643
<i>It's just so messy and blurry.</i>

48:18.080 --> 48:19.605
<i>I see</i>

48:21.160 --> 48:23.003
<i>a TV.</i>

48:23.720 --> 48:24.960
What?

48:27.560 --> 48:30.450
<i>I see a lot of TVs.</i>

48:31.800 --> 48:33.086
What the...

48:33.480 --> 48:35.687
I think she's seeing this.

48:36.240 --> 48:37.401
How is that possible?

48:37.480 --> 48:39.528
<i>I see toys.</i>

48:40.320 --> 48:41.321
Dude.

48:41.680 --> 48:44.524
<i>I see bunches of toys.</i>

48:48.160 --> 48:50.288
<i>I see people.</i>

48:50.840 --> 48:52.171
<i>Brothers.</i>

48:52.680 --> 48:53.681
Fuck.

48:54.200 --> 48:57.522
<i>I'm pretty sure. I think they're brothers.</i>

48:59.760 --> 49:02.047
Whoa, dude. What the fuck?

49:02.520 --> 49:04.522
<i>I think they're watching me.</i>

49:04.600 --> 49:05.761
They're talking about us.

49:06.000 --> 49:07.650
<i>Stay with him.
Only he can do this.</i>

49:07.760 --> 49:08.841
Some bizarre shit.

49:08.960 --> 49:10.450
<i>Only he can be there.</i>

49:14.200 --> 49:16.567
Daddy! I can't sleep.

49:17.040 --> 49:19.486
What are you doing awake, huh?

49:19.600 --> 49:21.568
What's going on? Tell me.

49:21.800 --> 49:24.724
- You're making so much noise.
- I'm making too much noise?

49:24.920 --> 49:26.649
Daddy'll go up
and make sure everything...

49:26.800 --> 49:28.086
<i>Bless you.</i>

49:28.160 --> 49:29.400
- Okay.
- What the...

49:30.120 --> 49:31.963
Wait, Ry, did you...

49:32.720 --> 49:33.926
What the...

49:35.840 --> 49:38.810
So, this is the tape I was telling
you about from last night. Check it out.

49:38.880 --> 49:40.769
<i>You hear noises in your room?</i>

49:40.840 --> 49:42.560
<i>Daddy'll go up
and make sure everything's...</i>

49:43.400 --> 49:44.401
<i>Bless you.</i>

49:44.480 --> 49:46.289
- Wait. Play that again.
- So, here, I blew it up.

49:46.440 --> 49:49.489
Look. Leila sneezes,
and then Kristi says, "Bless you."

49:49.920 --> 49:51.365
<i>Daddy'll go up
and make sure everything's.</i>

49:51.440 --> 49:53.920
<i>Bless you.</i>

49:54.000 --> 49:56.207
These people,
I think they're watching us.

49:56.320 --> 49:58.080
And I know these tapes
are from 20 years ago.

49:58.320 --> 50:01.767
But they can see what's happening
here with us and with Leila.

50:10.920 --> 50:12.843
There's a door?

50:13.680 --> 50:15.011
Really?

50:16.440 --> 50:18.204
Where does it go?

50:19.920 --> 50:21.763
And I can go there?

50:23.240 --> 50:25.527
All I have to do is draw it?

50:26.680 --> 50:28.011
Okay.

50:46.040 --> 50:48.088
Oh, my God.

50:49.040 --> 50:50.565
What is all this?

50:50.880 --> 50:52.723
I don't think
these are just scribbles.

50:52.800 --> 50:55.087
I think there's a pattern to these.

50:55.160 --> 50:56.730
Some of these look familiar.

50:57.040 --> 50:59.486
I know I've seen this stuff before.

51:00.240 --> 51:01.969
Those symbols on Leila's wall?

51:02.040 --> 51:04.520
They're on the tapes too,
in the girls' room.

51:04.600 --> 51:06.011
That symbol there?

51:06.080 --> 51:07.764
It's used by a coven called the Midwives.

51:07.840 --> 51:09.604
You mean like witches?

51:09.800 --> 51:12.371
These Midwives
go all the way back to the Middle Ages.

51:12.560 --> 51:14.881
- Oh, my God.
- They were into devil worship.

51:14.960 --> 51:16.166
They would use symbols like this

51:16.240 --> 51:18.811
to open these doorways
to different places and times.

51:20.040 --> 51:22.202
- What is that?
- I don't know.

51:23.680 --> 51:25.682
Sounds like it's in Leila's room.

51:27.240 --> 51:28.765
What is that?

51:30.960 --> 51:31.961
I don't know.

51:40.280 --> 51:41.930
What is that?

51:44.760 --> 51:46.762
Em, there's something coming
from that recorder.

51:46.840 --> 51:48.330
Be careful.

51:50.960 --> 51:52.769
Honey, what are you doing?

51:53.600 --> 51:55.364
Baby, what? What are you doing?

51:55.440 --> 51:57.283
Honey. Honey.

51:58.200 --> 51:59.201
Lee!

51:59.360 --> 52:00.725
- What the fuck?
- Baby.

52:01.280 --> 52:03.442
Lee, are you okay? Honey.

52:03.800 --> 52:06.280
Baby, baby, breathe. Breathe, baby.

52:06.600 --> 52:09.206
Calm down. Okay, good girl.

52:10.120 --> 52:12.487
Breathe. Good girl.

52:18.200 --> 52:19.964
What were you doing?

52:20.040 --> 52:22.407
He's gonna take me away.

52:23.040 --> 52:25.646
Who's gonna take you away?

52:26.480 --> 52:28.562
Who's gonna take you away?

52:33.000 --> 52:34.729
Who's gonna take you away?

52:37.800 --> 52:38.801
What was that?

52:39.520 --> 52:40.521
I don't know.

52:59.920 --> 53:02.127
What is that?
Is something out there?

53:02.240 --> 53:03.605
I don't know.

53:08.760 --> 53:09.966
What the fuck?

53:10.080 --> 53:11.960
Just keep looking.
I'm gonna go check on Skyler.

53:28.200 --> 53:29.247
Mike!

53:30.600 --> 53:32.011
Mike, what are you doing?

53:38.200 --> 53:39.850
Mike. Joke's over, man.

53:45.280 --> 53:46.645
It's not funny, Mike.

54:07.160 --> 54:08.161
Mike.

54:24.120 --> 54:25.121
- Ryan.
- Ah!

54:25.360 --> 54:26.646
- What?
- What are you doing?

54:27.840 --> 54:30.320
Oh, no.
Did you see that?

54:30.640 --> 54:32.768
- What? No.
- There was somebody right here.

54:32.840 --> 54:33.841
No, I don't see anything.

54:33.920 --> 54:35.081
- You didn't see it?
- No.

54:35.160 --> 54:36.161
Fuck.

54:41.320 --> 54:42.606
Look, she's sleeping.

54:42.680 --> 54:44.569
What did you see?
There's no one in here.

54:50.760 --> 54:52.091
What the fuck?

54:58.840 --> 55:00.251
What is that?

55:00.320 --> 55:01.960
I don't know. I don't see anything.

55:18.600 --> 55:20.204
There's nothing fucking there.

55:21.520 --> 55:22.520
Fuck!

55:22.560 --> 55:25.450
Get Leila! Let's go! Get out of here!

55:25.520 --> 55:27.010
Oh, my... What was that?

55:27.080 --> 55:28.081
Fuck!

55:33.680 --> 55:35.762
Hi, please. Can I talk to
Father Michael, please?

55:35.840 --> 55:38.241
Our house has been...
We think it's like haunted

55:38.320 --> 55:40.440
or something and something's
affecting our daughter...

55:41.880 --> 55:46.602
I was on hold, but I'm looking to speak
with Father Alessio? Right.

55:46.720 --> 55:48.609
I'll just call him back at 4:00. Thank you.

55:48.960 --> 55:50.564
She's been acting strange.

55:50.640 --> 55:52.360
And things have just been
starting to happen

55:52.400 --> 55:54.368
more and more and we really
don't know what to do.

56:00.160 --> 56:01.491
Baby Jesus.

56:01.600 --> 56:03.170
Here's Mary.

56:06.320 --> 56:08.527
She's going to have a special baby.

56:08.600 --> 56:10.762
That's right. She is.

56:10.840 --> 56:12.729
Do you remember us coming
into your room last night

56:12.800 --> 56:14.689
when you were on your recorder?

56:18.760 --> 56:23.288
Well, when we came in there

56:24.240 --> 56:26.083
and put you back to bed,

56:26.160 --> 56:29.528
you said, "He's gonna take me away."

56:32.600 --> 56:35.206
Who's gonna take you away?

56:36.040 --> 56:37.849
Do you mean Tobi?

56:37.920 --> 56:40.002
Would you please answer me?

56:43.520 --> 56:45.602
Lee, please answer me.

56:45.680 --> 56:47.921
Lee? Answer your mom.

56:55.000 --> 56:56.001
Lee.

56:56.880 --> 56:58.644
Where is he gonna take you?

57:00.880 --> 57:02.723
To be with the others.

57:06.760 --> 57:08.649
Hi. This is my wife, Emily.

57:08.720 --> 57:09.767
Hi. How are you?

57:09.840 --> 57:12.366
We're so grateful that you're here.
Thank you so much.

57:12.440 --> 57:14.602
I just hope I can be of help to you guys.

57:14.680 --> 57:17.411
I think you can.
We'll explain everything to you.

57:17.480 --> 57:20.404
This camera picks up stuff
that none of our other cameras can see.

57:21.080 --> 57:22.366
It's wild.

57:22.440 --> 57:24.249
And you're sure nothing
unusual was happening

57:24.360 --> 57:25.805
in the house before you started to use it?

57:25.920 --> 57:26.921
No.

57:27.040 --> 57:30.522
I've seen this camera on these tapes
from 20 years ago.

57:30.960 --> 57:34.328
It's like they were
using the camera to see this stuff, too.

57:34.400 --> 57:36.129
Father, watch this.

57:36.640 --> 57:38.165
It started out small. Right?

57:38.240 --> 57:39.890
I thought it was just a glitch.

57:39.960 --> 57:42.167
It's getting darker
when you see it through the camera?

57:42.240 --> 57:43.680
And bigger, like it's growing.

57:43.720 --> 57:46.166
Look at this dark figure
that moves through the door.

57:46.920 --> 57:49.526
Either of you ever
experienced anything like this before,

57:49.600 --> 57:50.840
here or any other place?

57:51.080 --> 57:52.206
Nothing like this.

57:52.320 --> 57:54.482
I found this tape
of these girls playing Bloody Mary,

57:54.600 --> 57:57.524
the same game Leila was
playing the other night.

57:57.600 --> 57:59.762
What if she learned this from them?

58:00.640 --> 58:03.325
They would tape themselves
doing these weird rituals.

58:03.560 --> 58:04.560
<i>You're doing so well.</i>

58:04.600 --> 58:06.728
<i>Tobi is going to be so proud of you.</i>

58:06.800 --> 58:08.802
You think
this is the Tobi that Leila speaks of?

58:09.000 --> 58:10.240
- Yeah.
- We think so.

58:10.320 --> 58:12.527
Has she used any other name
besides Tobi?

58:12.600 --> 58:14.921
No. Just Tobi.

58:16.320 --> 58:17.685
Why?

58:18.520 --> 58:21.364
Sometimes spirits will tend to
hide their own identities,

58:21.440 --> 58:23.841
their true nature.
They'll use another name.

58:24.000 --> 58:26.606
From what you describe,
from what I know,

58:26.800 --> 58:28.689
which is very little,

58:30.800 --> 58:32.643
it sounds as if your daughter

58:32.760 --> 58:35.286
may be being stalked

58:35.360 --> 58:37.966
by a demon or a demonic presence.

58:38.040 --> 58:39.371
If this is happening, we should go.

58:39.440 --> 58:41.169
We should get out now.

58:41.680 --> 58:43.409
We need to leave the house!

58:43.480 --> 58:44.760
I never noticed anything before.

58:44.800 --> 58:47.565
Demons do not haunt houses,
they haunt people.

58:47.640 --> 58:50.086
If you leave this house,
it will definitely follow you.

58:50.160 --> 58:51.924
Demons feed on fear.

58:52.480 --> 58:54.323
The more attention you give,

58:54.440 --> 58:57.046
the stronger it grows, the bigger it grows.

58:57.360 --> 58:59.089
- You run away, it follows.
- You can't just ignore

58:59.160 --> 59:00.730
what's happening in the house, Father.

59:00.840 --> 59:02.922
Would it be all right
if I spoke with your daughter?

59:03.000 --> 59:04.729
- Would that be okay?
- Yeah.

59:04.840 --> 59:07.320
We have a guest here.

59:13.880 --> 59:17.885
He's our friend. He's a really nice man.

59:18.240 --> 59:19.321
Stop.

59:19.400 --> 59:20.640
She's a little shy.

59:20.840 --> 59:22.922
Does that name mean anything to you?

59:24.400 --> 59:26.164
No. Why? Should it?

59:27.800 --> 59:29.723
I want you to meet somebody.

59:31.360 --> 59:33.203
Oh, here she comes.

59:33.920 --> 59:36.241
Is this your friend?

59:36.400 --> 59:39.051
Does your friend have a name?

59:39.760 --> 59:41.922
Don't tell me. Let me see.

59:42.760 --> 59:43.841
Griselda?

59:44.040 --> 59:45.371
Tell him his name.

59:45.480 --> 59:47.926
Is it Geraldine?

59:48.400 --> 59:49.970
It's Bubba, isn't that right, baby?

59:50.040 --> 59:51.724
Oh, I like the name Bubba.

59:52.920 --> 59:54.809
That's a great name.

59:54.880 --> 59:56.882
Bubba looks really hot.

59:57.440 --> 59:59.841
Can I give Bubba a little bath?

59:59.920 --> 01:00:01.649
Can I put some water on him?

01:00:02.720 --> 01:00:05.166
Let me just give Bubba a little water.

01:00:05.600 --> 01:00:09.002
Oh, Bubba likes it. He's very happy.

01:00:09.080 --> 01:00:12.129
Can I give you a little
water on your head?

01:00:12.200 --> 01:00:13.964
Make you feel cool?

01:00:14.280 --> 01:00:16.408
How about that, hmm?

01:00:17.400 --> 01:00:19.084
Much better, huh?

01:00:20.240 --> 01:00:21.241
Yeah.

01:00:21.960 --> 01:00:23.450
You feel better now?

01:00:27.960 --> 01:00:29.325
Yeah.

01:00:30.080 --> 01:00:33.641
So, what are you and
Bubba gonna do today?

01:00:35.240 --> 01:00:37.607
You have a secret for me?

01:00:38.800 --> 01:00:39.801
Hmm?

01:00:42.640 --> 01:00:44.608
What is it, honey?

01:00:49.120 --> 01:00:50.531
Oh, my God!

01:00:50.720 --> 01:00:53.371
I'm so sorry. This is nothing like her.

01:00:53.600 --> 01:00:54.681
It's fine. I'm all right.

01:00:54.760 --> 01:00:56.205
Look. I just want you
to take care of your daughter.

01:00:56.280 --> 01:00:57.327
- Okay?
- Okay.

01:00:57.440 --> 01:00:59.841
I'll be back soon.
Stay calm, stay relaxed.

01:01:01.720 --> 01:01:03.370
She fucking bit a priest.

01:01:04.600 --> 01:01:05.720
After what Father Todd said,

01:01:05.760 --> 01:01:07.444
I went back and did more research.

01:01:07.520 --> 01:01:08.806
I found this tape in the camera.

01:01:08.920 --> 01:01:09.887
I thought it was blank. But look.

01:01:09.960 --> 01:01:10.961
Wait! That's your house.

01:01:11.080 --> 01:01:14.004
Look at the date.
It's three days before we moved in.

01:01:14.080 --> 01:01:15.411
<i>...very happy with this house.</i>

01:01:15.480 --> 01:01:16.845
<i>It's a good house for him.</i>

01:01:16.920 --> 01:01:19.400
You hear that?
I think it's that leader guy talking.

01:01:19.680 --> 01:01:20.681
I don't know, man.

01:01:20.760 --> 01:01:22.400
Maybe it's just
a contractor or something.

01:01:22.480 --> 01:01:24.562
<i>This is a good space.
They've done a wonderful job.</i>

01:01:24.640 --> 01:01:26.881
See, Ryan, he's just
talking about the house, that's all it is.

01:01:26.960 --> 01:01:28.246
<i>Very good entry point in here.</i>

01:01:28.320 --> 01:01:29.810
No. He said "entry point."

01:01:29.880 --> 01:01:32.360
The fact that we moved
into this specific house

01:01:32.480 --> 01:01:34.164
of all the houses we looked at...

01:01:34.680 --> 01:01:36.480
It just doesn't seem like
a coincidence to me.

01:01:36.520 --> 01:01:41.651
No, no, not Higgins. Hubbard. H-U-B-B...

01:01:42.120 --> 01:01:44.805
Right, Hubbard.
Katie Hubbard. That's what I've been...

01:01:44.880 --> 01:01:46.006
That's impossible.

01:01:46.080 --> 01:01:47.684
Because I'm looking at her card

01:01:47.760 --> 01:01:49.683
and your number is on her card.

01:01:49.760 --> 01:01:51.603
They're saying they've
never heard of her.

01:01:51.680 --> 01:01:53.409
She never worked for them.

01:01:54.040 --> 01:01:56.850
We weren't even looking in
this neighborhood, remember?

01:01:57.160 --> 01:01:59.367
And we thought the deal
was too good to be true.

01:01:59.640 --> 01:02:01.051
- Yeah.
- Remember that?

01:02:01.400 --> 01:02:04.131
Where did she come from?
How did you meet her?

01:02:04.240 --> 01:02:05.571
I called the agency today.

01:02:05.640 --> 01:02:07.642
They have no record that
she ever worked there.

01:02:08.200 --> 01:02:09.611
Nobody had ever heard of her.

01:02:09.680 --> 01:02:12.331
What? But that's...

01:02:12.400 --> 01:02:14.368
What if, like...

01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:18.971
What if someone
placed us here on purpose?

01:02:19.040 --> 01:02:22.522
If somebody conspired
for us to be in this house?

01:02:24.240 --> 01:02:26.481
Do you think that could be possible?

01:02:27.240 --> 01:02:28.571
Where did she come from?

01:02:29.480 --> 01:02:31.448
- Sure you want to do this?
- Yeah.

01:02:31.560 --> 01:02:33.050
You need some sleep, sweetie.

01:02:33.120 --> 01:02:34.770
Wake me up if anything happens. Okay?

01:02:35.800 --> 01:02:38.485
All right. I left
a message with Father Todd.

01:02:38.640 --> 01:02:40.165
Hopefully he calls us back.

01:03:34.400 --> 01:03:35.925
What the fuck?

01:03:51.960 --> 01:03:54.088
- Emily, wake up.
- What?

01:03:54.160 --> 01:03:56.811
Did you hear that?
Did you hear that?

01:03:56.880 --> 01:03:58.405
Something knocked the camera
over in the hallway.

01:03:58.560 --> 01:04:00.164
- You didn't hear anything?
- No.

01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:16.650
Hey, sweetie.

01:04:16.720 --> 01:04:18.722
Sweetie, sorry. Go back to bed.

01:04:19.280 --> 01:04:22.443
Sweetie, go back to sleep now, all right?

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.321
Don't be scared, Mommy.

01:04:42.160 --> 01:04:43.241
Stay here.

01:04:44.680 --> 01:04:47.331
Ryan, what's going on
up there, man?

01:04:48.600 --> 01:04:51.080
- What was that noise?
- I'm not sure.

01:04:52.920 --> 01:04:54.445
What do you see?

01:04:59.920 --> 01:05:01.081
There's nothing here.

01:05:14.800 --> 01:05:16.131
Mike.

01:05:17.040 --> 01:05:18.565
I think I see something.

01:05:18.640 --> 01:05:19.846
What?

01:05:20.800 --> 01:05:22.962
- You see something?
- Don't move.

01:05:27.200 --> 01:05:28.565
- Do you see...
- Stay still.

01:05:28.640 --> 01:05:30.324
Is something here?
Is something here?

01:05:30.560 --> 01:05:32.720
Mike, stay calm.
You heard what Father Todd said.

01:05:32.760 --> 01:05:35.161
Just don't move.

01:05:36.640 --> 01:05:39.166
Oh, fuck. Holy fuck.

01:05:40.880 --> 01:05:42.803
Mike, run, run!

01:05:46.080 --> 01:05:47.570
Something...
I felt something on my neck!

01:05:47.640 --> 01:05:49.085
I felt something!

01:05:49.160 --> 01:05:50.810
It was fucking huge, Mike.

01:05:50.880 --> 01:05:53.247
Holy fuck. I don't know where he went.

01:05:53.640 --> 01:05:55.244
Fuck!

01:05:57.480 --> 01:06:00.848
- What was that?
- Shit. What the fuck, dude?

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:06.321
Wait, wait, wait. I see it.

01:06:06.440 --> 01:06:07.771
It's over by the tree.

01:06:07.920 --> 01:06:09.684
- What the fuck?
- I don't know.

01:06:09.760 --> 01:06:10.921
Dude!

01:06:11.360 --> 01:06:13.010
Oh, my God.

01:06:15.200 --> 01:06:16.929
Ryan, where is it? Do you see it?

01:06:17.000 --> 01:06:19.685
Emily, stay upstairs!
Lock the door!

01:06:20.800 --> 01:06:21.926
In the kitchen!

01:06:22.480 --> 01:06:25.006
Shit! Fuck! What do you see?

01:06:26.520 --> 01:06:27.601
Fuck me, Ryan!

01:06:27.680 --> 01:06:29.682
Next time I'm just gonna stay at Mom's!

01:06:32.360 --> 01:06:33.521
God!

01:06:33.760 --> 01:06:34.920
- You all right?
- No!

01:06:34.960 --> 01:06:36.849
It fucking touched me, dude!

01:06:36.960 --> 01:06:38.962
Did you see the keyboard move, dude?

01:06:39.040 --> 01:06:40.041
What the fuck?

01:06:40.800 --> 01:06:42.131
I don't see anything.

01:06:42.560 --> 01:06:43.641
What the fuck?

01:06:43.720 --> 01:06:45.961
- What the fuck's going on?
- I don't know.

01:07:00.360 --> 01:07:01.725
Fuck, it's getting closer.

01:07:01.800 --> 01:07:03.006
It's in the doorway.

01:07:03.360 --> 01:07:05.328
- Where is it? What?
- The doorway to the kitchen.

01:07:13.320 --> 01:07:16.483
He came through the door!
He's in the room with us.

01:07:19.160 --> 01:07:20.491
What the fuck?

01:07:30.200 --> 01:07:31.645
Hey! Fuck, go!

01:07:31.720 --> 01:07:33.643
Jesus Christ!

01:07:33.720 --> 01:07:35.210
Go, Mike, go, go, go!

01:07:35.320 --> 01:07:37.368
Fuck! What the fuck? Shit!

01:07:37.440 --> 01:07:38.771
I don't see anything.

01:07:39.720 --> 01:07:41.802
What the fuck, man?
What the fuck was that?

01:07:41.880 --> 01:07:43.644
What the fuck is wrong with your house?

01:07:49.360 --> 01:07:51.010
<i>When you grow up,</i>

01:07:52.080 --> 01:07:56.290
<i>you're going to take care
of your sister and a lot of others.</i>

01:07:56.360 --> 01:07:58.169
<i>Because the two of you</i>

01:07:59.520 --> 01:08:03.491
<i>are going to help us find
other special people just like you.</i>

01:08:15.400 --> 01:08:16.401
<i>Ah!</i>

01:08:16.479 --> 01:08:17.481
What the fuck?

01:08:26.920 --> 01:08:27.921
Em! Emily.

01:08:30.840 --> 01:08:33.127
Oh, my God. What the fuck?

01:08:35.479 --> 01:08:36.606
What the fuck did that to him?

01:08:36.680 --> 01:08:38.966
I think it was Tobi
that broke that guy's back.

01:08:39.040 --> 01:08:41.611
It seems like he's getting bigger
and more powerful, Em.

01:08:41.720 --> 01:08:44.451
I mean, what if they put him here
to kill us like they did this guy?

01:08:44.520 --> 01:08:45.930
We need to take it to the police.

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:47.126
You think they can help?

01:08:47.200 --> 01:08:48.725
They have to be able to say something.

01:08:48.800 --> 01:08:50.319
They have to know
something about this.

01:08:50.359 --> 01:08:52.488
You don't think
they're gonna think I'm crazy?

01:08:52.560 --> 01:08:53.890
Who gives a fuck
if they think we're crazy?

01:08:53.960 --> 01:08:55.200
This is fucking crazy.

01:09:00.240 --> 01:09:01.240
Skyler will be home soon.

01:09:01.279 --> 01:09:02.930
Mike and I will be
as quick as possible. All right?

01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:04.490
- Okay.
- Just stay with Leila.

01:09:04.560 --> 01:09:08.087
I love you. We'll be back
as soon as we can, all right?

01:09:16.240 --> 01:09:18.242
Would you like some tea?

01:09:28.920 --> 01:09:29.921
Hey.

01:09:30.680 --> 01:09:32.523
Let's go downstairs and play.

01:09:33.399 --> 01:09:36.448
Lee, come on. We have games
that we can play downstairs.

01:09:37.399 --> 01:09:38.731
No, I'm fine here.

01:09:40.720 --> 01:09:43.371
How about me and you
get out of the house?

01:09:43.960 --> 01:09:45.200
Come on, we can go outside.

01:09:45.279 --> 01:09:47.328
We can go on the seesaw,
your favorite thing.

01:09:49.680 --> 01:09:51.250
This is where I want to be now.

01:09:51.319 --> 01:09:52.810
Let's go downstairs.

01:09:53.160 --> 01:09:55.970
We can play down there.
It's just you and me, okay?

01:09:57.880 --> 01:09:59.609
I said I'm fine.

01:10:01.800 --> 01:10:04.121
Honey, I don't want to be
in this room, okay?

01:10:05.960 --> 01:10:08.804
I don't really want to be in this room,
so let's go downstairs.

01:10:11.160 --> 01:10:13.606
Mommy, I said I'm fine here.

01:10:13.680 --> 01:10:16.684
That's enough!
We're going downstairs right now.

01:10:26.200 --> 01:10:27.486
I'm fine here.

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:35.490
Is there someone in this room?

01:10:36.320 --> 01:10:38.721
Leila, are you talking
to somebody in this room?

01:11:16.800 --> 01:11:18.131
Oh, my God.

01:11:18.200 --> 01:11:20.567
Leila! Leila! Oh, my God!

01:11:20.640 --> 01:11:23.166
Open the door. Leila, open this door!

01:11:23.520 --> 01:11:24.521
Lee!

01:11:27.360 --> 01:11:28.361
Where is she?

01:11:28.480 --> 01:11:30.130
God. Where the fuck did it go?

01:11:31.120 --> 01:11:33.600
Lee, let's go.
We're getting outta here. Go. Lee.

01:11:33.680 --> 01:11:35.842
Oh, God! Where the fuck are you?

01:11:35.920 --> 01:11:37.570
Where the fuck are you?

01:11:38.200 --> 01:11:39.884
Leave my daughter alone!

01:11:43.360 --> 01:11:45.560
- What are you looking for?
- I know I saw it somewhere.

01:11:45.600 --> 01:11:47.443
Just a tape, Mike. Just a tape.

01:11:48.040 --> 01:11:49.963
Skyler, how's Em?
She need anything?

01:11:50.040 --> 01:11:52.281
She's in her room with Leila.
They're resting.

01:11:52.640 --> 01:11:53.641
What are you guys doing?

01:11:53.800 --> 01:11:55.600
I found this
down at the police station.

01:11:57.200 --> 01:11:58.964
Leila and Hunter
have the same birthday?

01:11:59.040 --> 01:12:00.485
That has to be a coincidence.

01:12:00.560 --> 01:12:02.403
Yeah. One hell of a coincidence, right?

01:12:02.640 --> 01:12:04.483
June 6th, 2005.

01:12:05.080 --> 01:12:07.651
Kristi's son is born on
the exact same day as Leila.

01:12:07.760 --> 01:12:10.331
- They haven't found him yet?
- No. Katie is his aunt.

01:12:10.560 --> 01:12:12.528
She killed Kristi and the dad.

01:12:12.640 --> 01:12:14.244
They even think she killed
this family in Nevada.

01:12:14.320 --> 01:12:16.084
Cops have been looking for her for years.

01:12:16.160 --> 01:12:17.207
Wait. Here it is.

01:12:18.680 --> 01:12:20.489
Look, there he is.
There he is, right there.

01:12:20.720 --> 01:12:23.007
I knew I'd seen this kid before.

01:12:23.280 --> 01:12:25.282
Look. Look.

01:12:26.560 --> 01:12:28.210
Tell me that's not him.

01:12:29.040 --> 01:12:31.486
This tape is from 1992, Skyler.

01:12:32.160 --> 01:12:33.720
So, the kid wasn't even born yet.

01:12:33.760 --> 01:12:35.967
- How did he get there?
- I can't explain it.

01:12:36.080 --> 01:12:38.162
He and Leila have
the exact same birthday.

01:12:38.520 --> 01:12:41.091
What if this is where
Tobi's gonna take Leila?

01:12:55.320 --> 01:12:57.402
Hey, sweetie. Whatcha doing?

01:12:59.040 --> 01:13:00.246
You waiting for Santa Claus?

01:13:00.320 --> 01:13:01.970
He's not gonna be here for a few days.

01:13:04.960 --> 01:13:06.769
Get away from me.

01:13:19.280 --> 01:13:21.601
I'm putting this camera
back in her room.

01:13:23.280 --> 01:13:24.520
We need to keep an eye on her.

01:13:24.600 --> 01:13:27.649
Look, Father Todd said
he would come back and help.

01:13:27.920 --> 01:13:29.285
We just need to stay calm.

01:13:30.160 --> 01:13:31.844
Come get some rest.

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:01.651
Leila, come play with me.

01:15:45.240 --> 01:15:47.402
- Leila? Leila!
- Where is she?

01:15:47.520 --> 01:15:49.170
- Leila!
- Leila!

01:15:49.240 --> 01:15:50.446
Leila!

01:15:50.760 --> 01:15:52.000
Lee!

01:15:52.600 --> 01:15:54.125
Leila!

01:15:56.160 --> 01:15:58.080
- What's going on?
- We can't find Leila!

01:15:58.120 --> 01:15:59.121
What?

01:16:00.200 --> 01:16:03.727
I don't know where she went! Leila!

01:16:05.880 --> 01:16:07.609
- Leila!
- Leila!

01:16:11.760 --> 01:16:13.762
Ry! That was Leila's room!

01:16:13.880 --> 01:16:15.166
- Leila!
- Leila!

01:16:17.440 --> 01:16:19.283
- Lee? Baby.
- Leila!

01:16:19.400 --> 01:16:20.447
Leila!

01:16:20.520 --> 01:16:22.921
My baby, where were you, honey?

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:25.207
Hey, sweetie. Hey.

01:16:25.520 --> 01:16:26.726
Where were you, baby?
Where were you?

01:16:26.800 --> 01:16:30.805
Cold. Talk to me.
Talk to Daddy. Are you okay?

01:16:30.920 --> 01:16:32.729
I'm going to set him free, Daddy.

01:16:32.920 --> 01:16:34.240
Let's go!
We're leaving right now!

01:16:34.280 --> 01:16:35.645
No! I'm not going.

01:16:35.800 --> 01:16:39.168
Honey, stop it!
We love you. Stop screaming.

01:16:40.360 --> 01:16:42.840
I'm not going!
I'm not going!

01:16:50.160 --> 01:16:51.491
Hello?

01:16:54.320 --> 01:16:55.845
Do you see anything?

01:16:58.600 --> 01:16:59.647
Clear.

01:17:05.800 --> 01:17:06.847
Let's make this quick.

01:17:07.680 --> 01:17:09.170
In here somewhere.

01:17:11.320 --> 01:17:12.560
Do you see anything?

01:17:12.640 --> 01:17:15.041
No, I'm not picking anything up.

01:17:18.680 --> 01:17:21.160
I'm not crazy, right?
It feels different in here.

01:17:21.280 --> 01:17:22.930
It doesn't feel as bad.

01:17:23.640 --> 01:17:26.246
Yeah, it does.
It's like a different place.

01:17:26.320 --> 01:17:28.322
Should we call them at the hotel?

01:17:28.840 --> 01:17:32.606
No, let's let them sleep.
I bet they're exhausted.

01:17:33.080 --> 01:17:35.560
Oh, Em said make sure
to grab a jacket for Leila.

01:17:35.640 --> 01:17:36.721
Okay.

01:17:38.040 --> 01:17:39.690
Do you see anything?

01:17:40.360 --> 01:17:42.044
No.

01:17:43.040 --> 01:17:44.804
Oh, Wait. What's that?

01:17:44.880 --> 01:17:46.211
Did that happen last night?

01:17:46.280 --> 01:17:48.009
I don't remember
seeing it before.

01:17:49.360 --> 01:17:51.203
I'm not seeing anything.

01:17:53.720 --> 01:17:55.051
You okay?

01:17:55.160 --> 01:17:57.845
- What is that?
- Don't know. Just found them.

01:17:59.480 --> 01:18:00.891
Okay, let's...

01:18:01.560 --> 01:18:03.085
Let's get the fuck out of here.

01:18:03.240 --> 01:18:05.686
- Ready to go?
- Just a sec.

01:18:05.880 --> 01:18:08.406
Come on.
We should get back. It's getting dark.

01:18:08.720 --> 01:18:10.848
Look at all this stuff.
Ryan's been going crazy.

01:18:10.920 --> 01:18:12.809
This is the research he was
talking about at the hotel.

01:18:12.880 --> 01:18:14.689
Look at this.

01:18:16.160 --> 01:18:18.242
Holy shit.
That's like Leila's drawing.

01:18:18.560 --> 01:18:21.370
It looks like it. "Revelations 5:6."

01:18:21.440 --> 01:18:23.204
"The slain lamb will be
used against God,

01:18:23.280 --> 01:18:25.169
"for the blood of
the chosen ones will taint it

01:18:25.320 --> 01:18:27.322
"and help give life to one
of the seven princes of hell.

01:18:27.480 --> 01:18:29.160
"Each prince shall return
through the blood

01:18:29.200 --> 01:18:30.690
"of the two born of the same moon."

01:18:32.240 --> 01:18:34.368
That's Leila and Hunter. It's their blood.

01:18:34.480 --> 01:18:37.006
What if the witches are using
them in some kind of ritual

01:18:37.080 --> 01:18:38.730
to give Tobi a human body?

01:18:38.800 --> 01:18:40.120
What? Skyler,
what does this mean?

01:18:41.600 --> 01:18:42.965
What was that?

01:18:46.080 --> 01:18:48.082
What is that? Is that the door?

01:19:06.120 --> 01:19:08.009
- What was that?
- The front door's open.

01:19:08.120 --> 01:19:10.282
- Did you lock it?
- Yes.

01:19:10.360 --> 01:19:11.646
Hello?

01:19:13.120 --> 01:19:14.645
Em? Ry?

01:19:14.960 --> 01:19:16.200
- Hello?
- Skyler...

01:19:16.480 --> 01:19:18.050
I'm just checking.

01:19:19.840 --> 01:19:21.126
Hello?

01:19:45.080 --> 01:19:46.411
What was that?

01:19:49.320 --> 01:19:50.367
It was Leila's room.

01:19:54.320 --> 01:19:56.084
Didn't we leave that door open?

01:19:56.520 --> 01:19:58.010
I don't remember.

01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:15.525
Leila? Leila?

01:20:15.600 --> 01:20:17.284
- What are you doing?
- What...

01:20:18.920 --> 01:20:20.968
You've got to stop, sweetie. Leila, stop.

01:20:23.160 --> 01:20:25.288
Leila. No, no, no, stop, sweetie.

01:20:25.360 --> 01:20:28.807
Answer me. Leila,
where's your mom and dad?

01:20:28.880 --> 01:20:30.245
Where's your mom and dad?

01:20:32.720 --> 01:20:33.960
Leila!

01:20:34.040 --> 01:20:36.247
I am the bringer of he.

01:20:36.320 --> 01:20:37.651
What?

01:20:38.560 --> 01:20:40.050
Who's "he"?

01:20:42.560 --> 01:20:44.688
Leila, no, honey.
Leila, stop. Stop. Leila, stop.

01:20:45.720 --> 01:20:47.848
Do you mind
if I touch your hands, honey?

01:20:52.080 --> 01:20:54.970
She just, uh, showed up here?

01:20:55.040 --> 01:20:58.203
Yeah. We were at a hotel,
six miles away.

01:20:58.280 --> 01:20:59.611
We went to sleep for two minutes.

01:20:59.680 --> 01:21:02.047
- I have no idea how she got here.
- She was gone.

01:21:07.080 --> 01:21:09.082
Can we have a chat in the kitchen?

01:21:09.760 --> 01:21:12.047
Yeah. Hey, Sky, could you take her?

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:18.480
I've spoken to someone
outside the Church.

01:21:18.600 --> 01:21:21.080
There's only one way
to save your daughter.

01:21:21.400 --> 01:21:25.530
But I have serious reservations
about what they proposed.

01:21:25.680 --> 01:21:28.251
Father, you are
the only one who believes us.

01:21:28.360 --> 01:21:30.089
- You have to help us.
- We have to do something.

01:21:30.160 --> 01:21:33.482
If we don't, we'll end up like
Hunter Rey and his family.

01:21:33.600 --> 01:21:36.206
An exorcism is a remedy
for someone who's possessed.

01:21:36.280 --> 01:21:38.567
I do not think that's what's
happening right here.

01:21:40.240 --> 01:21:42.481
- What do we need?
- What's happening?

01:21:43.400 --> 01:21:45.846
We need an extermination.

01:21:48.640 --> 01:21:50.244
Emily, do you have them?

01:21:50.560 --> 01:21:52.483
We need to soak
those sheets in holy water.

01:21:52.560 --> 01:21:55.404
It'll subdue the demon
and protect us against him.

01:21:55.920 --> 01:21:59.686
Ryan, your daughter
was born on June 6th,

01:21:59.760 --> 01:22:02.240
2005. Right?

01:22:02.320 --> 01:22:04.004
It's the sixth day of the sixth month

01:22:04.080 --> 01:22:07.687
of the sixth year, 2005. 666.

01:22:07.760 --> 01:22:09.205
I believe this is no coincidence.

01:22:09.280 --> 01:22:11.487
She's part of the prophecy.

01:22:11.640 --> 01:22:13.722
The witches on those tapes,
the Midwives?

01:22:13.800 --> 01:22:15.529
I think their job is to give demons life,

01:22:15.640 --> 01:22:17.210
to allow them to walk the Earth.

01:22:17.440 --> 01:22:19.568
They targeted your daughter
to help them do so.

01:22:19.640 --> 01:22:20.721
You understand how serious this is?

01:22:20.800 --> 01:22:21.801
Yeah.

01:22:21.880 --> 01:22:25.521
So, we need to trap this thing
using your daughter as bait.

01:22:25.640 --> 01:22:27.802
Downstairs, we'll draw
the Key of Solomon.

01:22:27.960 --> 01:22:29.849
Once the demon is lured
inside the trap, we're gonna

01:22:29.960 --> 01:22:32.122
cover it with sheets
and burn it back to hell.

01:22:32.320 --> 01:22:35.290
The blessing of the Father Almighty
be upon this Creature of Salt

01:22:35.600 --> 01:22:37.090
and let all malignity and hindrance

01:22:37.160 --> 01:22:40.243
be cast forth hence
and let all good enter.

01:22:40.320 --> 01:22:42.209
In the name of the Holy Spirit. Amen.

01:22:42.280 --> 01:22:43.964
I'll go check on Leila.

01:22:44.160 --> 01:22:47.642
The blessing of the Father Almighty
be upon this Creature of Salt...

01:22:57.000 --> 01:22:59.800
That's good. Skyler,
make sure the line is straight. Okay?

01:22:59.960 --> 01:23:01.962
Complete the Key
and make sure it's straight.

01:23:02.480 --> 01:23:03.480
How's Leila? She okay?

01:23:03.520 --> 01:23:04.760
She's doing okay.
Emily's with her.

01:23:04.840 --> 01:23:06.444
That's perfect. Can you help? Please.

01:23:06.520 --> 01:23:09.763
Sheets and holy water.
Bring it over. Thank you.

01:23:09.880 --> 01:23:12.247
I'll try to lure the demon
out into the circle.

01:23:12.320 --> 01:23:13.685
We're gonna trap that thing.

01:23:13.800 --> 01:23:14.961
Scatter salt around the perimeter.

01:23:15.040 --> 01:23:16.087
All around the perimeter.

01:23:16.200 --> 01:23:18.407
St. Michael the Archangel,
defend us in battle.

01:23:18.840 --> 01:23:20.490
May God rebuke him, we humbly pray,

01:23:20.560 --> 01:23:21.925
and do thou as the Prince...

01:23:23.680 --> 01:23:25.011
- Tobi?
- I think so.

01:23:25.160 --> 01:23:26.650
Keep doing
what you're doing.

01:23:26.720 --> 01:23:28.165
We need to keep provoking him.

01:23:28.320 --> 01:23:29.924
Be our protection against the wickedness

01:23:30.040 --> 01:23:33.362
and snares of the devil.

01:23:33.560 --> 01:23:34.720
Father,
something's happening!

01:23:34.760 --> 01:23:36.888
St. Michael, the Archangel,
defend us in battle.

01:23:40.880 --> 01:23:42.609
Why is everything shaking?
What's happening?

01:23:42.760 --> 01:23:44.967
...and do thou, O Prince
of the heavenly host...

01:23:46.040 --> 01:23:47.530
Keep calm, everyone.

01:23:47.720 --> 01:23:48.767
By the power of God,

01:23:48.880 --> 01:23:52.043
cast into hell Satan
and all the evil spirits.

01:23:52.240 --> 01:23:53.969
Body of Christ... Cast into hell Satan

01:23:54.080 --> 01:23:56.208
and all the evil spirits.

01:23:56.360 --> 01:23:58.488
Water flowing from the side of Christ,

01:23:58.560 --> 01:24:00.210
wash me clean.

01:24:06.880 --> 01:24:09.087
Oh, my God! What is going on?

01:24:09.240 --> 01:24:12.050
Emily, go get Leila. It's time. It's time!

01:24:12.120 --> 01:24:13.720
- Get in the circle.
- Get in the circle.

01:24:13.760 --> 01:24:15.250
Everybody, get in the circle.

01:24:15.440 --> 01:24:16.441
Come with me.

01:24:16.560 --> 01:24:18.642
Everybody
in the circle. Now!

01:24:21.280 --> 01:24:23.760
Hail, Mary, full of grace.
The Lord is with thee.

01:24:23.880 --> 01:24:26.451
Blessed art thou amongst women...

01:24:26.520 --> 01:24:28.443
Hail, Mary, full of grace.
The Lord is with thee.

01:24:28.560 --> 01:24:29.766
Blessed art thou among women

01:24:29.880 --> 01:24:31.928
and blessed is the fruit
of thy womb. Jesus.

01:24:32.080 --> 01:24:33.491
Father,
what happened to her eyes?

01:24:33.600 --> 01:24:35.409
- Why are they black?
- Leila!

01:24:35.920 --> 01:24:37.251
Leila! What's happening to her?

01:24:37.400 --> 01:24:38.811
He knows what you're doing.

01:24:41.440 --> 01:24:43.568
- Oh, my God!
- What happened?

01:24:43.760 --> 01:24:45.250
Ryan, what's going on?

01:24:45.400 --> 01:24:46.765
Father Todd!

01:24:46.920 --> 01:24:48.251
Stay in the circle!

01:24:48.400 --> 01:24:49.640
What do you see?

01:24:49.720 --> 01:24:52.564
- What's happening?
- Ryan, what do you see?

01:24:53.240 --> 01:24:55.811
Where's Father Todd? You see him?

01:24:55.960 --> 01:24:58.088
Where'd he go? What do you see?

01:24:59.320 --> 01:25:00.651
Father?

01:25:01.440 --> 01:25:02.930
No!

01:25:03.280 --> 01:25:05.806
Oh, my God! Where did he go?

01:25:05.920 --> 01:25:07.684
What are we gonna do?

01:25:07.800 --> 01:25:09.440
We need Father Todd for this all to work!

01:25:11.160 --> 01:25:12.491
Hold on to Leila!

01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:17.129
Stay close! Hold on! Hold on to Leila!

01:25:24.160 --> 01:25:26.606
Get back! Get back into the circle!

01:25:26.680 --> 01:25:27.761
Where is it?

01:25:27.840 --> 01:25:29.126
Get back! I see it!

01:25:29.200 --> 01:25:31.806
Get back! Get in the circle! Get back!

01:25:38.120 --> 01:25:41.124
Mike! Get the sheets!
We got to get the sheets!

01:25:41.480 --> 01:25:43.482
Come on, we've got to put it on him!

01:25:48.640 --> 01:25:50.324
Emily, grab the camera.
What do you see?

01:25:50.640 --> 01:25:52.483
We got to say the prayers!
Get the book!

01:25:52.640 --> 01:25:54.005
Is it working?

01:25:54.200 --> 01:25:56.009
Skyler! The Bible!

01:25:56.320 --> 01:25:58.482
Hurry! We have to finish this!

01:25:58.840 --> 01:26:00.490
Here, I have it.

01:26:00.840 --> 01:26:02.444
"In the name of Jesus Christ, our Lord,

01:26:02.520 --> 01:26:04.010
"Mary, Mother of God,

01:26:04.160 --> 01:26:05.571
"behold the Cross of the Lord,

01:26:06.040 --> 01:26:07.769
"flee bands of enemies.

01:26:08.480 --> 01:26:10.084
"We drive you from us.

01:26:10.200 --> 01:26:13.010
"Whoever you may be, unclean spirits..."

01:26:14.320 --> 01:26:18.723
"Pray, therefore, the God of Peace,
to crush Satan beneath our feet."

01:26:21.920 --> 01:26:23.285
Oh, my God, it worked!

01:26:23.400 --> 01:26:24.561
Lee! You okay?

01:26:24.680 --> 01:26:26.011
Mommy? Daddy?

01:26:26.200 --> 01:26:28.521
- Sweetie, are you back?
- What happened?

01:26:28.680 --> 01:26:30.728
You're back. She's back. It worked.

01:26:31.520 --> 01:26:34.046
- It worked?
- It worked!

01:26:34.240 --> 01:26:35.321
She okay?

01:26:36.320 --> 01:26:37.720
- Mommy.
- Let's go. Let's go.

01:26:43.120 --> 01:26:46.727
Come on, let's see what we got.
Yeah, that's the good stuff right there.

01:26:46.800 --> 01:26:49.724
I'm liking it. I'm liking that butt.

01:26:49.800 --> 01:26:51.450
Dude, seriously?

01:26:51.560 --> 01:26:52.891
- What?
- You're filming my butt crack.

01:26:52.960 --> 01:26:54.803
Lift with your legs and not your back.

01:26:54.880 --> 01:26:56.006
Oh. Can I get a demonstration?

01:26:56.080 --> 01:26:57.366
- It's my...
- You wanna switch?

01:26:57.480 --> 01:27:01.166
I... My back is still funny from when
a coffee table was flung at me.

01:27:01.240 --> 01:27:03.049
- So I'm gonna...
- Hey, babe.

01:27:03.120 --> 01:27:04.804
- I'm gonna chill.
- Have you seen the kitchen box?

01:27:04.880 --> 01:27:06.530
Oh, it's such a quaint
little bungalow.

01:27:06.600 --> 01:27:07.600
I love it.

01:27:07.640 --> 01:27:09.529
Family of three. Five bedroom.

01:27:09.600 --> 01:27:10.600
What are you doing, kid?

01:27:10.640 --> 01:27:12.290
Excited about your new house?

01:27:12.360 --> 01:27:13.361
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

01:27:13.440 --> 01:27:15.727
Hey, sweetheart, it's hot out.
You wanna go inside?

01:27:15.800 --> 01:27:17.245
- No.
- You're good out here?

01:27:17.320 --> 01:27:19.971
Could you actually get me
an Arnold Palmer?

01:27:20.040 --> 01:27:21.041
Three ice cubes. Thank you.

01:27:21.120 --> 01:27:23.646
You like this house? You can put
all your dollies in your new room.

01:27:23.720 --> 01:27:27.247
Yeah. Mommy and Daddy
say I can paint it any color I want.

01:27:27.320 --> 01:27:28.401
Wow.

01:27:28.480 --> 01:27:30.528
So, are you gonna paint it light brown?

01:27:30.640 --> 01:27:32.483
Whoa.

01:27:33.760 --> 01:27:35.603
Oh, shit.

01:27:37.600 --> 01:27:39.921
- What is that?
- Oh, God.

01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:42.685
Why do we have this tape?

01:27:42.760 --> 01:27:46.446
- Let me see.
- That was just in that box.

01:27:46.520 --> 01:27:48.966
- Shit.
- Jesus.

01:27:49.040 --> 01:27:50.087
Do you believe this?

01:27:50.200 --> 01:27:52.009
How do we have that?

01:27:52.120 --> 01:27:53.485
I don't know.

01:27:59.040 --> 01:28:00.963
No more tapes.

01:28:01.040 --> 01:28:04.123
Okay? No more tapes. I promise.

01:28:04.200 --> 01:28:05.850
Let's get this cleaned up.

01:28:05.920 --> 01:28:07.285
Lee.

01:28:07.360 --> 01:28:08.805
Mommy, I'm over here.

01:28:09.840 --> 01:28:11.968
Look, Mommy, my friends are here.

01:28:12.040 --> 01:28:13.201
What the fuck?

01:28:15.360 --> 01:28:17.727
One, two, three,
four, five, six, seven,

01:28:17.800 --> 01:28:19.768
and one for good luck.

01:28:19.840 --> 01:28:21.842
I love this cake. It looks so good.

01:28:21.920 --> 01:28:23.365
Babe, you did such a great job
with the cake.

01:28:23.440 --> 01:28:24.487
Oh, my God.

01:28:24.560 --> 01:28:26.881
And everything out there just,
everything comes together.

01:28:26.960 --> 01:28:27.961
It looks amazing.

01:28:28.040 --> 01:28:29.451
All butterfly themed. She's gonna love it.

01:28:29.520 --> 01:28:32.251
Bouncy Castle, awesome part.

01:28:33.520 --> 01:28:34.521
- Hey.
- Hi, guys.

01:28:34.600 --> 01:28:36.170
Emily, let me help you.

01:28:36.240 --> 01:28:37.969
- It looks so pretty.
- Okay.

01:28:38.080 --> 01:28:40.287
Yeah, maybe you
should have carried that.

01:28:40.360 --> 01:28:41.486
Is it time for cake, yet?

01:28:41.560 --> 01:28:44.484
It is about to be time for cake.
I'm gonna get Leila.

01:28:44.560 --> 01:28:46.608
Yeah, so, where's Leila?
I wanna show her her present.

01:28:46.680 --> 01:28:48.569
- Hi, guys!
- Hi.

01:28:48.640 --> 01:28:51.007
Look who it is. The birthday girl.

01:28:51.080 --> 01:28:52.081
Hey.

01:28:52.160 --> 01:28:53.161
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:28:53.240 --> 01:28:55.083
- What do you got on your face?
- A butterfly.

01:28:55.160 --> 01:28:56.571
- Who wants birthday cake?
- Hey, guys.

01:28:56.640 --> 01:28:58.642
Me!

01:28:58.720 --> 01:29:00.324
Say cheese. Whoo!

01:29:02.040 --> 01:29:04.520
Hey, Happy Birthday.

01:29:05.840 --> 01:29:08.446
- Hey, sweetie, what'd you wish for?
- That's awesome.

01:29:08.520 --> 01:29:10.921
I can't tell anyone
or else it won't come true.

01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:14.288
Oh, you can tell me.
Dad's good at keeping secrets.

01:29:14.360 --> 01:29:17.489
I wished for, uh, a baby brother.

01:29:17.560 --> 01:29:19.688
A baby brother?

01:29:19.760 --> 01:29:21.171
That's my girl.

01:29:21.240 --> 01:29:22.366
- Look at you.
- She is so sweet.

01:29:22.440 --> 01:29:23.771
Oh, you having
a good day today, princess?

01:29:23.840 --> 01:29:25.365
- Yeah.
- Excellent. Happy Birthday.

01:29:25.440 --> 01:29:29.286
- You guys know what you're having?
- No, we are gonna be surprised.

01:29:29.360 --> 01:29:32.330
- Who wants cake?
- Yeah!
