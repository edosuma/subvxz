I DON'T HAVE ALL THE ANSWERS,

10:11.507 --> 10:13.009
BUT I KNOW THAT HE DID THIS.

10:13.109 --> 10:16.512
- TO SEND A LETTER LIKE THIS
HALFWAY ACROSS THE WORLD,

10:16.579 --> 10:18.781
NOT KNOWING IF IT'S EVEN
GONNA MAKE IT BACK,

10:18.848 --> 10:20.249
THE LEVEL OF PLANNING...

10:20.550 --> 10:24.520
IT'S ALMOST SOCIOPATHIC.
- NO, IT IS SOCIOPATHIC.

10:24.621 --> 10:27.023
- YOU EVER THINK
MAYBE HE'S NOT THE CRAZY ONE?

10:28.891 --> 10:30.927
- DALE, YOU OWE ME.

10:34.230 --> 10:36.966
IF I RUN THIS THROUGH PRINTS,
WE COULD GET A HIT ON MIKE,

10:37.033 --> 10:38.501
AND I AM BETTING YOU

10:38.601 --> 10:40.870
THAT HE IS WATCHING MY REPORTS
LIKE A HAWK.

10:40.937 --> 10:42.238
- YOU WANT ME TO RUN IT
THROUGH I.C.E.?

10:42.505 --> 10:44.607
- YEAH.

10:44.674 --> 10:46.576
- I'LL GO PUT MY SHOES BACK ON.

10:54.984 --> 10:56.152
- SURE ABOUT THIS?

10:56.252 --> 10:58.221
- YEAH.

10:58.488 --> 10:59.922
- OKAY, LOOK.
I WANT YOU TO TAKE THIS.

11:00.023 --> 11:02.191
IF ANYTHING GOES WRONG, YOU--
- IF ANYTHING GOES WRONG,

11:02.492 --> 11:05.628
I'M NOT GONNA SHOOT MY FATHER,
JOHNNY.

11:05.695 --> 11:07.897
- JUST HURRY BACK.
- I WILL.

11:19.509 --> 11:21.644
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

11:21.711 --> 11:23.713
- HEY, UH, YOUR DAD,

11:23.780 --> 11:25.615
HE WANTED TO RUN
SOME IDEAS BY ME

11:25.682 --> 11:27.016
ABOUT THE NEXT DROP.
- UH-HUH.

11:27.083 --> 11:28.785
- I WAS JUST INSIDE.
I DIDN'T SEE YOU.

11:28.885 --> 11:30.687
IT'S CRAZY.

11:30.787 --> 11:33.790
- I NEED A FAVOR, JOHNNY.
- WHAT'S UP?

11:33.856 --> 11:36.893
- MY FATHER HAS A CERTAIN
DEALING AT THE HOUSE TODAY,

11:36.959 --> 11:39.796
AND HE HAS...TOLD ME
THAT I'M NOT WELCOME.

11:39.862 --> 11:41.798
- HMM.
I'M SORRY TO HEAR THAT, MAN.

11:41.898 --> 11:44.667
- I NEED A RIDE TO TOWN.

11:44.767 --> 11:46.669
- YEAH, MAN,
I GOT A LOT OF SHIT

11:46.736 --> 11:50.106
ON MY PLATE RIGHT NOW,
SO...

11:50.206 --> 11:51.574
- OF COURSE.

11:52.909 --> 11:54.844
MAYBE MY SISTER CAN HELP.

11:59.082 --> 12:01.484
- HEY, OH.

12:01.551 --> 12:03.219
COME ON, MAN.

12:03.519 --> 12:05.188
YOU WANT A RIDE, I GOT YOU.

12:07.957 --> 12:10.193
- WHY, THANK YOU, JOHNNY.

12:26.576 --> 12:28.978
- WHAT DO WE GOT?

12:29.078 --> 12:31.013
- THIS LETTER PAINTS YOU
AS A REAL HERO,

12:31.114 --> 12:32.048
YOU KNOW THAT?
- DALE--

12:32.115 --> 12:33.149
- NO, I'M SERIOUS, PAIGE.

12:33.249 --> 12:34.717
WHEN THEY SAY
"ABOVE AND BEYOND"

12:34.784 --> 12:36.119
THIS IS WHAT
THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT--

12:36.219 --> 12:38.221
THE SHIT YOU DID TO PROTECT
THOSE GIRLS.

12:38.488 --> 12:40.189
I'M ALREADY HEARING TALKS
ABOUT A POSSIBLE COMMENDATION.

12:40.256 --> 12:41.724
- I DON'T NEED A GODDAMN
COMMENDATION, DALE.

12:41.791 --> 12:43.192
I WANT TO KNOW ABOUT THE PRINTS.

12:43.259 --> 12:44.827
- WE GOT A PARTIAL ON THE STAMP.

12:44.894 --> 12:46.162
- MIKE?

12:46.262 --> 12:48.030
- NO, WE MATCHED THE PRINTS
TAKEN FROM LINA'S BED

12:48.097 --> 12:49.465
AT THE COMPOUND.

12:49.565 --> 12:51.000
- NO.
- WE ALSO MATCHED A PRINT

12:51.100 --> 12:52.735
TAKEN FROM THE PINK BACKPACK,
THE FIRST ONE.

12:52.835 --> 12:55.471
DEAD GIRLS
DON'T LEAVE FINGERPRINTS.

12:55.571 --> 12:57.573
- MIKE HAD ACCESS TO THE BODY,
SO HE COULD'VE--

12:57.640 --> 13:01.210
- PAIGE, I GOT A LETTER
VERIFIABLY HANDLED BY YOUR GIRL

13:01.477 --> 13:04.614
SENT FROM OUT OF STATE THAT HER
OWN SISTER SWORE SHE WROTE.

13:04.714 --> 13:06.249
- NO. PEOPLE BELIEVE
WHAT THEY WANT TO BELIEVE.

13:06.549 --> 13:08.518
- YEAH, NO SHIT.
- DON'T YOU SEE?

13:08.618 --> 13:10.052
THIS IS WHAT HE WANTS.

13:10.153 --> 13:12.688
- YOU KNOW, THERE'S A VERSION
OF THIS WHERE YOU'RE HAPPY.

13:12.755 --> 13:14.857
BECAUSE IT MEANS SOMEWHERE
IN SCOTTSDALE, ARIZONA

13:14.924 --> 13:17.059
YOUR GIRL'S ALIVE.

13:19.929 --> 13:25.802
[Spanish radio announcer]

[Spanish guitar plays]

13:29.505 --> 13:32.742

- PERFECT.

13:32.809 --> 13:34.610
DO YOU LIKE

13:34.710 --> 13:36.679

13:39.148 --> 13:41.484
- REMINDS ME OF ALL MY AUNTS
AND UNCLES

13:41.584 --> 13:44.520
WHO JUST REFUSED TO ASSIMILATE.

13:44.620 --> 13:48.658
- IT'S FUNNY YOU SEE CULTURAL
PRIDE AS A PERSONAL AFFRONT.

13:48.758 --> 13:51.093
- WHY CROSS THE RIVER IF
YOU DON'T WANT TO BE AMERICAN?

13:51.194 --> 13:53.062
- MAKES SENSE REALLY.
I GUESS, YOU KNOW,

13:53.162 --> 13:55.698
YOU SEE THE WORLD
THROUGH THE CHAMELEON'S EYES,

13:55.765 --> 13:57.533
ALWAYS LOOKING FOR
AN OPPORTUNITY

13:57.633 --> 13:59.802
TO CHANGE YOUR COLOR, HUH?

13:59.902 --> 14:01.470
- HMPH.

14:01.537 --> 14:04.240
- THAT'S WHY YOU CHOSE
YOUR JOB.

14:04.507 --> 14:05.908
- WHAT, SMUGGLER?

14:05.975 --> 14:09.912

I MEAN YOUR REAL JOB.

14:09.979 --> 14:11.180
[volume rises]

14:11.247 --> 14:12.748
- WHAT JOB IS THAT?

14:12.815 --> 14:17.486
- THE ONE YOU DO FOR
THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT.

14:25.895 --> 14:27.897
- AH, AH!
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

14:27.964 --> 14:30.166
LET ME SEE YOUR HANDS, JOHNNY.

14:30.233 --> 14:32.201
LET ME SEE THEM, NOW.

14:32.501 --> 14:33.836
SLOW.

14:33.936 --> 14:36.906
PUT 'EM ON THE WHEEL.
[Johnny breathing hard]

14:36.973 --> 14:38.608
[whispers]
THERE YOU GO.

14:46.849 --> 14:50.052
- HOW LONG HAVE YOU KNOWN?
- ONLY SINCE LAST NIGHT.

14:50.119 --> 14:54.657
WHEN YOUR LITTLE FRIEND SWAPPED
THE MONEY IN THE BRIEFCASE.

14:54.724 --> 14:56.559
- IF YOU'RE GONNA DO IT,
DO IT.

14:57.960 --> 14:58.861
- OKAY.

15:01.063 --> 15:02.198
[phone beeps]

15:04.066 --> 15:06.135
IT'S TIME.

15:19.115 --> 15:21.717
- CHARLIE.

15:21.784 --> 15:25.855
CHARLIE, CHARLIE,
CHARLIE, CHARLIE.

15:25.955 --> 15:27.223
MORE OF A MAN'S NAME, INNIT?

15:27.490 --> 15:28.824
CHARLIE?

15:28.891 --> 15:33.195
- YEAH. MAYBE THAT'S WHY
YOU'RE SO SWEET ON ME.

15:49.178 --> 15:50.579
[whack]
- YOU'RE TALKING RUBBISH!

15:50.646 --> 15:51.580
- ENOUGH!

15:54.050 --> 15:55.151
THAT'S ENOUGH FOR NOW.

15:55.484 --> 15:57.153
- IT'S NOT ENOUGH
TILL SHE TALKS.

15:57.253 --> 15:59.555
- I'M TELLING YOU THAT'S ENOUGH.

15:59.622 --> 16:01.991
- FINE.

16:02.058 --> 16:04.126
I'VE GOT TO TAKE A PISS ANYWAY.

16:04.193 --> 16:06.762
YOU CAN KEEP HER COMPANY.

16:12.001 --> 16:15.538
- WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS TO ME?

16:15.604 --> 16:17.139
I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING TO YOU.

16:17.239 --> 16:19.475
- YOU DIDN'T DO ANYTHING?

16:19.575 --> 16:20.977
YOUR BOYFRIEND SHOT ME.

16:21.043 --> 16:23.112
- THAT'S NOT ME.

16:25.081 --> 16:27.683
- THIS WHOLE THING...

16:27.750 --> 16:30.052
ALL THIS, CHARLIE?
THIS ISN'T MY GIG.

16:30.152 --> 16:34.790
HE'S GONNA WORK YOU OVER
UNTIL YOU TALK, OKAY?

16:34.890 --> 16:36.492
SO JUST TALK.

16:36.559 --> 16:39.929
- THERE'S NOTHING TO SAY.

16:39.996 --> 16:43.499
AMBER, HE'S GONNA KILL ME.

16:43.599 --> 16:44.867
- IT'S NOT UP TO ME, CHARLIE.

16:44.934 --> 16:47.069
- LET ME GO.
- I CAN'T.

16:47.169 --> 16:49.572
- I'M NOT A COP!

16:54.577 --> 16:56.746
[phone ringing]

16:56.812 --> 16:58.080

NO, NO, NO,
DON'T DO ANYTHING YET.

17:05.021 --> 17:06.989
[cell phone vibrating]

17:07.056 --> 17:08.524
- WHAT THE HELL'S GOING ON?

17:08.624 --> 17:10.726
- AGENT DEMARCO NEVER ARRIVED
AT SATURN AND MARCONI.

17:10.793 --> 17:12.495
- SHE DIDN'T SHOW UP AT ALL
OR...

17:12.561 --> 17:15.131
- NEITHER DID THE TARGET.
- OKAY, OKAY, LET ME, UM...

17:15.197 --> 17:17.767
PUT AN APB OUT ON HER CAR.
I'LL MAKE SOME CALLS.

17:17.833 --> 17:19.035
- ALL RIGHT, GUYS,
YOU KNOW THE DRILL.

17:19.101 --> 17:21.203
WE GOT TWO HOURS
FOR A FOUR-HOUR MOVE.

17:21.470 --> 17:22.638
PACK IT UP.
PACK IT UP QUICK.

17:22.705 --> 17:24.040
- SIR, I CAN HANDLE
THIS FROM HERE.

17:24.106 --> 17:25.808
THIS DOESN'T AFFECT
OUR OPERATION.

17:25.908 --> 17:27.943
- THIS ISN'T A POINT OF DEBATE,
WARREN, THIS IS PROTOCOL.

17:28.010 --> 17:29.078
UNTIL THIS IS CLEARED OVER,
WE'VE GOT TO BE

17:29.178 --> 17:30.713
WITHIN 60 MILES
OF THE FIELD OFFICE.

17:30.813 --> 17:32.081
YOU KNOW THIS.
- FIELD OFFICE?

17:32.148 --> 17:33.215
WHAT WAS YOUR CALL ABOUT?

17:33.516 --> 17:35.684
- THEY FOUND A PARCEL AT HQ
ADDRESSED TO ME.

17:35.751 --> 17:37.053
DOGS THINK
IT MIGHT BE EXPLOSIVE.

17:37.119 --> 17:39.121
- WHAT?
LOOK, WE CAN'T PULL OUT NOW.

17:39.221 --> 17:40.556
BRIGGS IS STILL IN TECATE.

17:40.656 --> 17:41.690
- NO, HIS COVER'S SOLID, RIGHT?

17:41.791 --> 17:42.892
WE CAN ARREST SID TOMORROW.

17:42.958 --> 17:44.560
LET'S MOVE IT!

17:52.535 --> 17:55.204
- NO RADIOS,
NO RECORDING DEVICES, ETCETERA.

17:55.471 --> 17:58.474
THOSE ARE THE HOUSE RULES.
SO WHEN WE PARK, GEAR DOWN.

17:58.541 --> 18:00.810
- YOU KNOW THAT LEAVES US
NAKED, RIGHT, SID?

18:00.876 --> 18:03.512

HUH?

18:06.949 --> 18:11.587
[phone vibrating]

18:11.654 --> 18:13.722

LET'S TAKE EVERYBODY IN.
- YEP.

18:21.163 --> 18:24.100
- HEY, UH, SID,
CAN I MAKE A QUICK CALL?

18:24.166 --> 18:26.769
- BROTHER, WE'RE NOT HEADING
INTO A DINNER PARTY HERE.

18:26.836 --> 18:29.839

PLEASE.

18:29.905 --> 18:33.008
- ALL RIGHT, MAKE IT QUICK.
- THANKS MAN, TWO SECONDS.

18:39.215 --> 18:41.484
HEY, BELIEVE IT OR NOT,
THIS ISN'T A GOOD TIME.

18:41.550 --> 18:42.751
- YOU HAVE NO IDEA.

18:42.852 --> 18:44.753
EVIDENTLY THERE'S
A BOMB SCARE IN LOS ANGELES.

18:44.820 --> 18:45.888
- BOMB SCARE?

18:45.955 --> 18:47.156
- YEAH, THEY'RE PULLING
EVERYBODY BACK.

18:47.223 --> 18:49.492
THEY FOUND A PACKAGE
WITH CLARK'S NAME ON IT.

18:49.558 --> 18:51.494
- YOU ARE TELLING ME THERE'S
NO ARRESTING UNIT STATESIDE?

18:51.594 --> 18:52.795
- NO, NO, I'M STAYING.

18:52.895 --> 18:53.929
- WELL, IF IT'S ALL HANDS
ON DECK--

18:54.029 --> 18:55.030
I'M STAYING.

18:55.131 --> 18:56.599
EVERY TIME WE GET
THIS CLOSE TO SID,

18:56.665 --> 18:58.134
THE WHOLE WORLD FALLS APART.
WELL, NOT TODAY.

18:58.234 --> 19:00.569
- YOU THINK THIS WAS SID?

19:00.636 --> 19:02.171
- THERE'S NO DOUBT IN MY MIND.

19:03.739 --> 19:07.510
HEY, BRIGGS,
HAVE YOU HEARD FROM CHARLIE?

19:07.610 --> 19:09.712
- CHARLIE?
NO, WHY?

19:09.778 --> 19:11.647
- DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.
I'LL TAKE CARE OF IT.

19:11.747 --> 19:14.683
- YOU'LL TAKE CARE OF WHAT?

19:14.750 --> 19:16.252
HEY, YOU'LL TAKE CARE OF WHAT?

19:16.519 --> 19:20.089
- OKAY, LOOK, SHE WENT TO GO
MEET AMBER TO BRING HER IN,

19:20.156 --> 19:23.626
AND THE TEAM JUST SAID
THAT NEITHER OF THEM SHOWED UP.

19:23.692 --> 19:24.927
- WHERE THE HELL IS SHE, MIKE?

19:24.994 --> 19:27.496
- BRIGGS, YOU JUST STAY THERE
AND STAY ON TASK.

19:27.596 --> 19:29.765
I WILL TAKE CARE OF THIS,
OKAY?

19:31.467 --> 19:32.968
- I'M COMING BACK.
- BRIGGS.

19:33.035 --> 19:34.570
- I'M COMING BACK.
- NO--

19:34.637 --> 19:36.772
- YEAH, I'M TAKING THE SUV
AND I'M HEADING NORTH.

19:36.839 --> 19:38.040
- NO, NO.

19:38.140 --> 19:39.975
- IT'LL TAKE ME ABOUT
THREE HOURS TO GET UP THERE.

19:40.042 --> 19:41.544
- NO, YOU ARE NOT LEAVING.

19:41.644 --> 19:42.912
YOU NEED TO STAY--
[dial tone]

19:43.012 --> 19:44.680
[tires screeching]

19:45.915 --> 19:46.815
SHIT.

19:50.119 --> 19:51.153
- HEY, ARE YOU READY?

19:51.220 --> 19:53.956
- NO, BRIGGS IS ABANDONING
THE OPERATION.

19:54.056 --> 19:55.758
- ABANDONING?
WHAT THE HELL DOES THAT MEAN?

19:55.824 --> 19:57.826
- MEANS I'M GOING TO TECATE.
- NO, THAT'S NOT AN OPTION.

19:57.927 --> 19:59.762
- ALL RIGHT, SID IS THERE
COLLECTING HIS MONEY RIGHT NOW.

19:59.828 --> 20:01.964
IF NO ONE IS THERE
TO WITNESS IT--I'M GOING.

20:02.031 --> 20:03.065
- AND I'M TELLING YOU NO.

20:03.165 --> 20:04.500
I CAN OFFER YOU NO SUPPORT
AND YOU HAVE

20:04.600 --> 20:06.635
ZERO JURISDICTION IN MEXICO.

20:06.702 --> 20:07.803
WHAT THE HELL DO YOU
EVEN PLAN ON DOING?

20:07.870 --> 20:08.971
- WHATEVER IT TAKES.

20:09.071 --> 20:11.207
HE'S NOT GETTING AWAY AGAIN.

20:11.507 --> 20:14.076

20:57.720 --> 20:58.721
[man speaks Spanish]

21:00.723 --> 21:02.258
- SHE AIN'T GOT NOTHING TO DO
WITH THIS, DUDE.

21:02.524 --> 21:03.592
LEAVE HER OUT OF IT.

21:03.692 --> 21:04.760
- "PLEASE LEAVE HER
OUT OF THIS."

21:04.860 --> 21:06.095
OR WHAT, JOHNNY?
HUH?

21:06.161 --> 21:10.466
- IF YOU HURT EITHER ONE OF US,
FATHER WILL HAVE YOU BEATEN.

21:10.566 --> 21:12.101
- YOUR FATHER...

21:12.201 --> 21:15.237
IS DEAD.
ESTA MUERTO.

21:15.537 --> 21:16.605
- NO.
SI.

21:16.705 --> 21:18.140

21:18.240 --> 21:22.011
HE WILL BE SOON,
WHICH MEANS I AM IN CHARGE NOW.

21:22.111 --> 21:23.979

21:24.079 --> 21:25.681
TELL ME WHAT YOU WANT,

21:25.748 --> 21:28.083
- YOU SEE YOUR LOVER HERE?

21:28.150 --> 21:29.818
YOU KNOW HE'S AN FBI AGENT?

21:29.885 --> 21:32.588
HE WAS GONNA THROW US ALL
IN JAIL.

21:34.056 --> 21:35.824
OH, YOU DID KNOW THAT.

21:35.891 --> 21:40.095
SO, YOU WERE GOING TO LET
THIS MAN TAKE YOUR FATHER.

21:40.162 --> 21:43.866
YET NOW YOU SIT HERE
CRYING FOR THE SAME MAN?

21:43.966 --> 21:47.670
AI, LUCIA, LUCIA, LUCIA,

21:47.736 --> 21:49.738
THAT FATHER WOULD FORSAKE ME
FOR JOHNNY,

21:49.805 --> 21:51.807
THAT WAS PAINFUL.

21:51.874 --> 21:53.776
PREDICTABLE, YES, BUT PAINFUL.

21:53.876 --> 21:55.711
BUT YOU, MY SISTER?

22:07.022 --> 22:10.159
COME ON.

23:00.175 --> 23:02.177
SI, HERMANITA.
YOU'RE RIGHT.

23:02.244 --> 23:04.713
THAT IS ENOUGH.

23:04.813 --> 23:08.717
I UNDERSTAND
THE FBI RUNS MY PLANES,

23:08.817 --> 23:11.687
BUT PERHAPS YOU CAN CONVINCE
THEM THAT YOUR OPERATION

23:11.754 --> 23:14.623
IS ONGOING, YES?

23:14.690 --> 23:15.691
- MAYBE.

23:15.891 --> 23:19.027
WILL...
TELL THEM.

23:19.094 --> 23:22.064
BECAUSE IF MY PLANES STOP,
LUCIA STOPS.

23:22.131 --> 23:23.799
¿ENTIENDES?

23:23.866 --> 23:25.067
SAY IT FOR ME.

23:25.167 --> 23:27.002

THERE YOU GO.

23:35.144 --> 23:37.713
THAT'S ENOUGH, LOVER BOY.

23:39.114 --> 23:40.048
GO.

23:40.115 --> 23:42.484
GO ON.

23:42.584 --> 23:44.753
LUCIA WILL BE OKAY.

23:48.991 --> 23:51.994
I WILL TAKE GOOD CARE
OF LUCIA.

25:48.243 --> 25:51.613
JESUS CHRIST,
YOU SHOT YOURSELF WITH IT

25:51.680 --> 25:52.714
AND YOU SHOT YOUR TEAM.

25:52.814 --> 25:56.952
- NO, IT WAS ALL YOU...
WARREN.

25:57.052 --> 25:58.887
YOU DID THIS.

25:58.954 --> 26:00.022
- THE BOMB?

26:00.088 --> 26:02.591
- YEAH, IF I SENT CLARK
THE PACKAGE,

26:02.691 --> 26:06.128
HE WOULD HAVE TO LEAVE.
I KNEW YOU'D STAY.

26:06.228 --> 26:09.531
BECAUSE YOU'RE TOO PROUD.

26:09.631 --> 26:14.202
BUT FOR YOU TO ACTUALLY
COME OUT HERE...

26:14.503 --> 26:16.605
WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH YOU?

26:16.672 --> 26:19.474

26:48.570 --> 26:52.941
[sirens approaching]

27:11.193 --> 27:12.761

27:12.828 --> 27:14.730
THIS IS ABOUT THE HEIGHT
OF BULLSHIT.

27:14.796 --> 27:16.031
AFTER WHAT YOUR GIRLFRIEND
PULLED LAST TIME.

27:16.131 --> 27:18.133

BRITISH GUY.

27:30.512 --> 27:33.148
IF SHE'S WITH HIM, THEN...
CHARLIE'S IN TROUBLE.
