01:34:44.636 --> 01:34:46.436
I have an idea.
Your turn's next.

01:34:46.438 --> 01:34:48.672
When you're asked,
I need you to pick dare.

01:34:48.674 --> 01:34:50.673
Why would I do that?

01:34:50.675 --> 01:34:54.113
(DISTORTED, SINGSONGY):
Markie...

01:34:55.214 --> 01:34:56.746
Truth or dare?

01:34:56.748 --> 01:34:59.516
(CRYING):
Now Lucas is asking me.

01:34:59.518 --> 01:35:01.517
Pick dare.

01:35:01.519 --> 01:35:04.221
- But don't do it.
- What? I'll die.

01:35:04.223 --> 01:35:06.255
Markie, I am so sorry

01:35:06.257 --> 01:35:08.659
for keeping that secret
from you for so long.

01:35:08.661 --> 01:35:10.393
And I swear to you

01:35:10.395 --> 01:35:12.396
I will never, ever keep
anything from you again.

01:35:12.398 --> 01:35:14.798
But we survive this
only if we trust each other.

01:35:14.800 --> 01:35:16.169
Okay?

01:35:18.737 --> 01:35:21.237
- Okay.
- Trust me.

01:35:21.239 --> 01:35:23.240
CALUX:
You have to pick.

01:35:23.242 --> 01:35:24.874
Dare.

01:35:24.876 --> 01:35:27.777
I dare you to shoot Olivia.

01:35:27.779 --> 01:35:31.347
He wants me to shoot you.

01:35:31.349 --> 01:35:33.150
You got to trust me, Markie.
Don't do it.

01:35:33.152 --> 01:35:35.218
This is the only way
to save us both.

01:35:35.220 --> 01:35:38.123
Okay. I trust you.

01:35:41.227 --> 01:35:43.162
I won't do it.

01:35:48.666 --> 01:35:50.267
No!

01:35:50.269 --> 01:35:51.368
(GROANS)

01:35:51.370 --> 01:35:53.570
(OLIVIA PANTING)

01:35:53.572 --> 01:35:55.438
Dare complete, Calux.

01:35:55.440 --> 01:35:57.141
Your turn.

01:35:57.143 --> 01:35:59.910
Truth or dare?

01:35:59.912 --> 01:36:01.477
(DISTORTED):
I'm not in this game.

01:36:01.479 --> 01:36:03.146
No, once you're asked,
you're in.

01:36:03.148 --> 01:36:04.780
Those are the rules, right?

01:36:04.782 --> 01:36:06.682
So, truth or dare, asshole?

01:36:06.684 --> 01:36:09.418
Truth.

01:36:09.420 --> 01:36:13.323
How do we get out
of this game alive?

01:36:13.325 --> 01:36:15.424
(CHUCKLES)

01:36:15.426 --> 01:36:17.527
You can't.

01:36:17.529 --> 01:36:20.364
Carter was the only one
who could stop this.

01:36:20.366 --> 01:36:24.368
So now the game won't end
until all the players are dead.

01:36:24.370 --> 01:36:26.770
And your turn's next.

01:36:26.772 --> 01:36:31.508
Unless you find
some new friends to play with.

01:36:31.510 --> 01:36:34.581
But that's not
gonna happen, is it?

01:36:38.483 --> 01:36:41.384
- Your arm.
- I'm okay.

01:36:41.386 --> 01:36:43.253
Well, did it work?

01:36:43.255 --> 01:36:45.755
It's not over. (PANTING)

01:36:45.757 --> 01:36:48.758
The game will never end,
not as long as we're alive.

01:36:48.760 --> 01:36:50.259
(GRUNTS)

01:36:50.261 --> 01:36:52.862
What are you doing?

01:36:52.864 --> 01:36:55.167
I'm choosing you.

01:37:03.908 --> 01:37:05.844
(THUNDER RUMBLING)

01:37:08.947 --> 01:37:11.582
OLIVIA: <i>My friends and I
went on a trip to Mexico</i>

01:37:11.584 --> 01:37:14.618
<i>for spring break.</i>

01:37:14.620 --> 01:37:16.753
<i>We ended up in an old mission</i>

01:37:16.755 --> 01:37:19.292
where we played a game
of Truth or Dare.

01:37:22.760 --> 01:37:26.230
We had no idea that we had
encountered an unspeakable evil

01:37:26.232 --> 01:37:27.763
that wanted to play with us.

01:37:27.765 --> 01:37:31.301
When we went home,
the game kept going.

01:37:31.303 --> 01:37:33.339
It killed five of my friends.

01:37:34.505 --> 01:37:35.871
The game is real.

01:37:35.873 --> 01:37:37.708
Tell the truth, do the dare,

01:37:37.710 --> 01:37:40.009
or you die;
refuse to play, you die.

01:37:40.011 --> 01:37:44.880
It can happen anywhere,
and it can come from anyone.

01:37:44.882 --> 01:37:47.618
I am so sorry,
but I have to ask you...

01:37:47.620 --> 01:37:49.622
truth or dare?
