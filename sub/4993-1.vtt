00:30.296 --> 00:33.927
Mr. Zander,
former Green Beret.

00:36.961 --> 00:39.593
Medal of Honor
recipient.

00:41.260 --> 00:44.223
CIA operative.

00:44.259 --> 00:50.221
former head of the Black
Cobra Mercenary Society.

00:52.422 --> 00:55.387
I thought you would have
been a bigger challenge,

00:55.421 --> 00:58.719
but what a
disappointment you are.

00:58.753 --> 01:02.519
You're beginning
to sound like my father.

01:04.686 --> 01:07.550
Is there anything you
would like to tell us now?

01:07.585 --> 01:09.382
Yeah.

01:09.417 --> 01:12.114
I want to thank you.

01:12.150 --> 01:15.681
You just saved me 1.500 bucks
in a root canal.

01:17.981 --> 01:19.413
Heh.

01:21.247 --> 01:23.045
Joke.

01:24.378 --> 01:26.977
Don't misunderstand me.

01:27.011 --> 01:29.310
I find you very funny,

01:29.344 --> 01:34.807
but I'm done with you
and your jokes.

01:34.841 --> 01:39.539
So tell me, Mr. Zander,

01:39.574 --> 01:42.471
do you have
any final words

01:42.506 --> 01:45.204
before I remove your
head from your body?

01:45.239 --> 01:49.735
Yeah, I do.

01:53.002 --> 01:55.035
Nice leg.

01:59.834 --> 02:01.966
Aah!
Aah!

02:05.066 --> 02:08.231
<i>Sayonara, amigos.</i>

02:16.062 --> 02:17.028
Cut!

02:17.062 --> 02:18.327
Cut! Cut!

02:18.361 --> 02:19.826
Darren, where are you?
Where are you?

02:19.861 --> 02:21.526
I-Is this how you
take care of me?

02:21.561 --> 02:23.259
It was supposed to be
taken care of.

02:23.294 --> 02:24.359
What happened?

02:24.393 --> 02:25.491
Sorry. It just
malfunctioned.

02:25.525 --> 02:26.591
My bad, baby.
My bad.

02:26.625 --> 02:27.590
Malfunctioned?
My bad.

02:27.625 --> 02:29.189
Wait. This is smoke.

02:29.224 --> 02:30.490
How could smoke
not function?

02:30.524 --> 02:31.622
No. We don't use
smoke anymore.

02:31.657 --> 02:32.856
No, no, no.

02:32.890 --> 02:34.489
No, no.
"Red Rocket" was smoke.

02:34.523 --> 02:36.321
That was whoosh. This is
different. This is wheesh.

02:36.355 --> 02:37.688
This is liquid
nitrogen, new formula,

02:37.722 --> 02:38.986
and it's safe
until it explodes.

02:39.021 --> 02:40.787
Nitrogen? Are you kidding me?
Yes.

02:40.821 --> 02:43.085
This is a chemical. This
can't be good for my body.

02:43.120 --> 02:44.486
Oh, baby,
you look fabulous.

02:44.520 --> 02:45.952
Yeah, man. You really
do look fabulous.

02:45.986 --> 02:47.351
Let's move on to scene 87.
Sorry, boss.

02:47.386 --> 02:48.750
Let's get
the green screen lit.

02:48.784 --> 02:49.816
Let's get Colton
in his new wardrobe.

02:49.851 --> 02:51.250
87? Hold on.
Wait a minute.

02:51.284 --> 02:52.516
Wait a minute.
Darren, I'm not doing 87.

02:52.551 --> 02:53.782
I'm wrapped.
I can't do this.

02:53.816 --> 02:54.849
We have to do scene 87.
I need you

02:54.883 --> 02:55.849
in the scene
with the bugs.

02:55.883 --> 02:57.348
What bugs? I hate bugs.

02:57.383 --> 02:58.814
I can't do a bug movie.
I'm not doing...

02:58.849 --> 03:00.313
It's so funny
that you say that,

03:00.347 --> 03:02.013
because you're in a
bug movie right now.

03:02.047 --> 03:03.245
That's what's happening.
I'm in a bug movie?

03:03.280 --> 03:05.278
When did this
become a bug movie?

03:05.312 --> 03:07.012
It became a bug movie when the writer
put his fingers on the keyboard.

03:07.046 --> 03:08.477
Excuse me. I hope she's
a good friend of yours,

03:08.511 --> 03:09.610
because you
just got her fired.

03:09.645 --> 03:10.744
Hit that
with something heavy.

03:10.778 --> 03:12.176
If I see that
near your face,

03:12.211 --> 03:13.676
your face is in
the unemployment office.

03:13.710 --> 03:15.242
What page is there
a bug movie?

03:15.277 --> 03:16.641
What page?
Did you read the script?

03:16.675 --> 03:17.908
Yeah, I looked it over.

03:17.942 --> 03:19.440
What do you mean
you looked it over?

03:19.475 --> 03:21.740
Did you put it on a coffee table
and look at it,

03:21.775 --> 03:24.139
or did you read it?
I read most of it, Darren.

03:24.173 --> 03:25.939
Come on. We're done here.
We're not done.

03:25.972 --> 03:27.405
We're not done.
Oh, really?

03:27.439 --> 03:29.337
Look, we're into
four hours of overtime,

03:29.372 --> 03:32.736
and you promised me I could take
my kid to see his favorite team.

03:32.770 --> 03:35.835
You promised me that you would
be a team player on this shoot,

03:35.869 --> 03:38.601
that I wouldn't have to put up
with your crap this time.

03:38.636 --> 03:40.467
I've been here for 16
hours choking on smoke.

03:40.501 --> 03:43.133
How much more of a
team player do you want?

03:43.167 --> 03:44.833
Don't walk out that door.
Really?

03:44.867 --> 03:46.231
You're making a mistake.
Really?

03:46.266 --> 03:47.231
Thank you, Amber.

03:47.266 --> 03:48.498
Oh, come on. Get bent.

03:48.533 --> 03:49.964
Don't walk out that door,
Colton.

03:49.999 --> 03:51.564
Okay, you did.
Now don't walk to your car.

03:51.598 --> 03:53.396
Really? Okay, it's
over for you if you do.

03:53.430 --> 03:54.962
Over? Come on.
Yeah.

03:54.997 --> 03:56.629
We know each other
10 years. We're buddies.

03:56.663 --> 03:58.328
10 years is nothing
in this business.

03:58.363 --> 03:59.995
I'm done with you.
Oh, come on.

04:00.029 --> 04:01.894
Look, Darren, you know
the only reason

04:01.928 --> 04:03.393
the producers
put me in this

04:03.427 --> 04:05.392
is to put my face
on the video box.

04:05.426 --> 04:08.225
On a video box? Did you just
time-travel here from the nineties?

04:08.260 --> 04:09.892
This is your problem.

04:09.925 --> 04:11.924
You live in a world of car
phones and fax machines.

04:11.958 --> 04:13.056
You're living in the past.

04:13.091 --> 04:14.390
"Red Rocket"
was 20 years ago.

04:14.424 --> 04:16.422
"Clown Cops"
was 25 years ago.

04:16.457 --> 04:19.288
You have to realize I only put you
in this move as a favor to Arni.

04:19.322 --> 04:21.221
I'm making a movie about
giant cockroaches, okay?

04:21.255 --> 04:23.553
It sells itself. It doesn't
need this, not anymore.

04:23.587 --> 04:25.585
Look, you don't have to say
that. That's not really nice.

04:25.620 --> 04:26.819
We're friends. Come on.

04:26.853 --> 04:28.151
Not anymore.
I'm done with you.

04:28.186 --> 04:29.485
Come on, Darren.

04:29.520 --> 04:31.484
I'm gonna see you
tomorrow morning.

04:31.519 --> 04:33.782
Not unless I'm down at the
unemployment office, you won't.

04:33.817 --> 04:34.949
Okay, bye, Colton.

04:34.984 --> 04:37.915
Meg, get Arni
on the phone.

04:46.313 --> 04:48.478
A recent swarm of earthquakes

04:48.513 --> 04:50.978
has been rocking
Southern California.

04:51.012 --> 04:53.043
Dr. Deckert Serbi is here
to talk about what is happening.

04:54.744 --> 04:56.476
Thank you for spending some time
with us today, Doctor.

04:56.510 --> 04:57.476
This is Colton.

04:57.511 --> 04:58.942
You walked off the set?

04:58.977 --> 05:00.408
Are you kidding me
right now?

05:00.443 --> 05:01.908
Are you kidding me,
Arni?

05:01.942 --> 05:03.440
It's a freaking
cockroach movie.

05:03.474 --> 05:05.306
He didn't read the script.

05:05.341 --> 05:07.706
It's what's
being offered.

05:07.740 --> 05:10.239
It's $10.000
for one day's work,

05:10.273 --> 05:12.238
and I had to beg
to get it for you!

05:12.272 --> 05:14.703
Well, you know what? They
can keep the money, okay?

05:14.737 --> 05:17.202
You know, I'm looking for something
with integrity and respect.

05:17.237 --> 05:19.401
Do you know that word,
Arni? "Respect."

05:19.436 --> 05:21.467
You know, I'm better
than this crap.

05:21.502 --> 05:22.467
No, you're not.

05:22.502 --> 05:24.700
I promised them...

05:24.734 --> 05:27.799
No, I swore to them
you would be a mensch!

05:27.833 --> 05:30.131
Nobody is more menschy
than me. You know that.

05:30.166 --> 05:32.930
Look, I just
bailed you out of jail.

05:32.965 --> 05:36.763
You were five seconds away from
orange is the new ass in town.

05:36.798 --> 05:39.929
They kept me four hours
after my day, okay?

05:39.963 --> 05:41.027
I don't care!

05:41.062 --> 05:42.694
You owe me money, Colt!

05:42.728 --> 05:45.594
Just turn your car around,
please, and go to work!

05:45.627 --> 05:47.725
Arni, I got another call.

05:47.759 --> 05:48.959
No more bug movies.

05:48.993 --> 05:50.725
Don't you hang up on me!

05:50.759 --> 05:52.357
Don't! Don't!

05:52.391 --> 05:54.290
Mother... Maggie!

05:54.325 --> 05:55.890
Hi, honey.

05:55.924 --> 05:57.723
Where the hell
are you?

05:57.757 --> 06:00.121
It's nice to hear
your voice, too, sweetheart.

06:00.156 --> 06:02.521
The game starts
in 20 minutes.

06:02.556 --> 06:04.054
Did you forget?

06:04.088 --> 06:06.520
No. Honey,
this is Los Angeles.

06:06.554 --> 06:07.919
Nobody gets to a game
before the fourth inning.

06:07.954 --> 06:09.752
You know that.

06:09.787 --> 06:11.419
Whatever.
I'm out of here.

06:11.453 --> 06:14.384
Uh, he's on...
he's on his way, sweetheart.

06:14.419 --> 06:17.050
I've heard it before.

06:17.084 --> 06:18.683
Wyatt.

06:20.483 --> 06:23.014
Great. He just walked
out of the house.

06:23.049 --> 06:24.848
What's with that kid?

06:24.882 --> 06:26.247
He doesn't listen
anymore.

06:26.281 --> 06:28.379
Tell him the freeway's
a parking lot.

06:28.414 --> 06:30.679
I'm gonna get there
as soon as I can.

06:30.713 --> 06:33.111
You know what?
You tell him.

06:33.146 --> 06:35.444
Colton West is
in the news again.

06:35.479 --> 06:36.777
Why are you
on TV?

06:36.811 --> 06:39.276
According to
law enforcement sources,

06:39.311 --> 06:42.775
nineties movie star and
action hero Colton West

06:42.809 --> 06:45.107
was booked last night
in Santa Monica

06:45.141 --> 06:48.173
on charges of aggravated assault
and resisting arrest.

06:48.208 --> 06:51.672
I guess that's one way to get
yourself back in the public eye.

06:51.706 --> 06:53.505
What kind of trouble
are you in now?

06:53.539 --> 06:55.771
I don't know, honey.
I really don't know.

06:55.805 --> 06:57.603
You know what?
I don't care.

06:57.637 --> 06:58.870
Goodbye, Colton.

07:00.803 --> 07:01.869
Whoa.
Did you feel that?

07:01.903 --> 07:03.268
Whoa!

07:03.303 --> 07:05.168
We're having an earthquake.

07:05.203 --> 07:07.000
Yeah, honey,
are you okay?

07:07.035 --> 07:08.867
Olivia, are you okay?

07:13.799 --> 07:16.064
Whoa!
You see that?!

07:26.562 --> 07:28.561
Everybody
take cover!

08:01.184 --> 08:03.216
Aah!

08:11.080 --> 08:12.513
Come on.

08:12.548 --> 08:14.345
Come on. Come on.

08:33.741 --> 08:35.139
Come on, answer.

08:35.174 --> 08:36.471
Answer.

08:38.272 --> 08:40.870
Reports are pouring in
of an unprecedented

08:40.905 --> 08:43.169
geological event
occurring in Los Angeles.

08:43.203 --> 08:44.868
How 'bout biological?

08:44.903 --> 08:47.135
How 'bout volcanic,
you moron?

08:47.170 --> 08:49.534
This is
a freaking apocalypse!

08:54.666 --> 08:56.999
In a follow-up story,
the Malibu bar fight

08:57.033 --> 09:00.197
involving nineties movie star
and action hero, Colton West,

09:00.231 --> 09:03.463
who was made famous
by his role as the Red Rocket

09:03.497 --> 09:07.061
and made famous the expression,
"Nice" anything.

09:07.096 --> 09:08.994
Nice nose.

09:09.028 --> 09:09.994
Nice tattoo. Yah!

09:12.528 --> 09:15.325
Nice tentacle.

09:15.360 --> 09:16.692
Eyewitnesses are now
coming forward

09:16.726 --> 09:18.991
to say that Colton West
was in fact

09:19.025 --> 09:20.557
trying to be a peacemaker.

09:20.591 --> 09:22.824
If that in fact is the case,

09:22.858 --> 09:24.956
then this reporter
has one thing to say.

09:27.289 --> 09:30.221
We interrupt this program
to bring you breaking news.

09:30.254 --> 09:31.985
The earthquakes
that have been shaking

09:32.020 --> 09:33.983
the L.A. basin
the last few minutes

09:34.018 --> 09:36.482
are in fact tied
to a volcanic eruption

09:36.516 --> 09:40.611
in the Santa Monica Mountains
near the Sepulveda Pass.

09:40.645 --> 09:42.044
Now, this would be

09:42.078 --> 09:45.607
an unprecedented volcanic event
that... Okay.

09:57.566 --> 09:59.962
Why is there
still no Internet?

10:00.996 --> 10:02.194
Damn it!

10:02.228 --> 10:04.125
You get Colton
on the phone yet?

10:04.159 --> 10:05.956
No. It keeps going
to voice mail.

10:05.992 --> 10:08.122
You guys
have to see this.

10:08.156 --> 10:10.720
One of my friends
just sent this to me.

10:15.417 --> 10:17.115
Yeah, that's great.

10:17.149 --> 10:19.013
My kid has
that app, too.

10:19.047 --> 10:20.213
Take a video
of anything,

10:20.247 --> 10:21.678
you can nuke it,
alien invade it,

10:21.713 --> 10:23.444
smash it with a meteor. What?

10:23.478 --> 10:25.075
He's already killed the
neighbor's cat 30 times.

10:25.109 --> 10:26.674
Oh, my God!

10:26.709 --> 10:28.074
That was a big one,
you guys.

10:28.108 --> 10:29.405
I think
we should go home.

10:29.440 --> 10:30.404
I think
you're right.

10:30.439 --> 10:32.170
That's a first.

10:32.205 --> 10:33.668
Now!

10:33.703 --> 10:35.933
Okay.

10:35.968 --> 10:37.732
Son of a...

10:46.193 --> 10:47.591
Spiders.
Did the spiders come?

10:47.626 --> 10:49.157
Have you seen
the spiders?

10:49.191 --> 10:50.555
Why didn't you tell me
about the bar fight?

10:50.589 --> 10:52.321
The bar... bar fight
was nothing!

10:52.355 --> 10:53.353
Nothing?
What...

10:53.387 --> 10:54.751
It's all over the news.

10:54.786 --> 10:56.216
"Colton West
is in trouble again."

10:56.251 --> 10:57.550
Did Arni bail you out?

10:57.584 --> 10:58.882
None of that matters.
Nothing matters.

10:58.916 --> 11:01.013
What matters
is you're okay.

11:01.048 --> 11:02.679
Thank God, honey,
you're okay.

11:02.713 --> 11:04.576
You're not gonna believe
what I saw.

11:04.611 --> 11:06.574
You're not gonna believe
what's going on on the freeway.

11:06.609 --> 11:07.574
Where's Wyatt?

11:07.609 --> 11:09.007
He left, remember?

11:09.041 --> 11:10.340
When did he do that?

11:10.374 --> 11:11.672
Of course you
don't remember. He...

11:11.706 --> 11:13.404
You forgot to pick
him up for his game,

11:13.438 --> 11:15.036
so he just walked
out of the house.

11:15.070 --> 11:16.502
Honey, have you seen
the news?

11:16.536 --> 11:18.500
Yes! You had a bar fight.

11:18.534 --> 11:21.031
Call Wyatt,
and get him back here.

11:21.065 --> 11:23.462
I have been
calling Wyatt,

11:23.496 --> 11:25.893
but of course
he's not picking up.

11:28.493 --> 11:31.821
You know what? I'm just gonna
go teach my kickboxing class.

11:31.856 --> 11:33.289
You're not
teaching anything.

11:33.322 --> 11:34.520
You're not going anywhere.

11:34.554 --> 11:35.818
Honey, it's not safe
out there.

11:35.853 --> 11:36.984
I don't want you
going anywhere.

11:37.019 --> 11:38.549
Stop it.
You're scaring me.

11:38.584 --> 11:40.315
All right, I'm sorry!
What do you want from me?

11:40.349 --> 11:42.380
I want you to talk to me
like a normal human being.

11:42.414 --> 11:43.480
Okay. Okay. Sweetheart,

11:43.514 --> 11:45.145
did you feel
the earthquake?

11:45.179 --> 11:46.211
Yes.

11:46.244 --> 11:47.210
Good! Good!

11:47.244 --> 11:48.375
I felt the earthquake.

11:48.409 --> 11:49.842
It was an earthquake.
Right.

11:49.875 --> 11:51.473
The fifth one this year.

11:51.507 --> 11:53.504
It's not like it's
the end of the world.

11:53.538 --> 11:55.436
Yes, it is, believe me.
The Santa Monica Mountains

11:55.471 --> 11:57.801
erupted like a volcano.
I was on the freeway,

11:57.836 --> 12:00.266
and I saw spiders
the size of men

12:00.300 --> 12:02.765
raining on hoods and spitting
fire out of their mouths.

12:02.798 --> 12:03.996
Fire out of their mouths.

12:04.030 --> 12:05.795
Have you
been drinking again?

12:05.830 --> 12:07.427
No.
You know what?

12:07.461 --> 12:08.960
That's it. I'm
calling Dr. Hertzberg.

12:08.994 --> 12:10.358
Honey, wait.
No, no, no. Stop it.

12:10.392 --> 12:11.823
In the car now.
Honey, stop it.

12:11.857 --> 12:13.922
I am not on anything.
I am completely sober.

12:13.956 --> 12:15.419
I need you
to listen to me.

12:15.454 --> 12:16.686
Sweetheart,
listen to me.

12:16.721 --> 12:18.751
I love you, okay?
I need you to pack

12:18.785 --> 12:19.817
everything that's
important to us.

12:19.851 --> 12:21.250
I want you to take the dog,

12:21.284 --> 12:22.615
I want you take
your jewelry,

12:22.649 --> 12:24.480
and I want you
to pack everything up,

12:24.513 --> 12:27.144
and you have to listen to me,
and we have to leave here.

12:29.611 --> 12:32.506
Colton,
we don't have a dog.

12:33.641 --> 12:36.171
Colton! Colton!

12:37.637 --> 12:40.001
Whoa, whoa. Wait, wait.
What is that for?

12:40.034 --> 12:42.798
I'm going to get Wyatt.
Honey, did you call him or not?

12:42.832 --> 12:45.130
Okay, okay. I was standing
here, talking to you.

12:45.165 --> 12:46.962
He said he was
going to Travis'.

12:46.996 --> 12:49.327
Oh, damn. Then he's probably
downtown riding bikes.

12:49.360 --> 12:51.091
Look, just stay
in the house.

12:51.125 --> 12:53.457
If he comes back, you
keep him here. You got it?

12:53.490 --> 12:55.155
Circuits are busy.

12:55.189 --> 12:56.588
Well, just keep trying.

12:56.622 --> 12:59.086
And tell everybody
to stay off the freeway.

13:25.299 --> 13:26.364
All right, get this.
Get this.

13:26.399 --> 13:27.396
Here he goes.
Here he goes.

13:29.829 --> 13:32.026
Whoo!

13:32.060 --> 13:34.292
Ah, wicked, man!

13:34.325 --> 13:36.689
Hey, dawg. I didn't
know you were coming.

13:36.723 --> 13:38.221
Glad you could
make it out.

13:38.255 --> 13:39.453
Hey, Jordan.
Sick move, man.

13:39.487 --> 13:40.785
Thanks.
Yeah.

13:40.821 --> 13:42.350
Should have been here
five minutes ago.

13:42.385 --> 13:43.949
Yeah. You should've seen.
My girl was sick.

13:43.983 --> 13:45.447
So are you
riding with us today?

13:45.482 --> 13:47.246
Yeah, for sure, if it's
cool with you guys.

13:47.281 --> 13:48.712
Of course.
Hell, yeah.

13:48.747 --> 13:50.211
Oh, right on. Let's go.

13:51.877 --> 13:53.942
Don't even think
about it.

13:53.975 --> 13:56.339
I've been trying forever
to get her out here.

13:56.374 --> 13:57.339
What did I do?

13:57.374 --> 13:59.038
Gave her a flirty smile.

14:00.070 --> 14:01.335
I did?
Yeah.

14:01.370 --> 14:02.735
Oh, okay. Well, um,
Eli's the one

14:02.768 --> 14:04.100
riding with her
right now,

14:04.134 --> 14:05.399
so you might wanna
go jump in on that.

14:05.433 --> 14:07.898
Dude, I don't care
about Eli.

14:07.931 --> 14:09.263
Don't mess this up
for me, man.

14:09.297 --> 14:11.727
Dude, relax.
It's... It's good.

14:11.761 --> 14:13.492
Come on. Let's just...
Come on. Let's ride.

14:13.527 --> 14:14.657
Whoa!

14:14.691 --> 14:16.158
Dude.

14:16.192 --> 14:17.190
What just happened?

14:19.122 --> 14:21.853
Whoa, did you guys
see that?

14:25.184 --> 14:26.415
That was big.

14:26.450 --> 14:28.680
Yeah. Let's check it out.

14:32.678 --> 14:34.209
Are you coming?

14:34.244 --> 14:36.074
What? Um...

14:36.108 --> 14:38.240
yeah. Yeah.

14:43.437 --> 14:45.567
Hey, it's Wyatt.
I'm not here right now.

14:45.602 --> 14:47.232
Leave a message.
Damn it.

14:51.230 --> 14:54.060
Damn. Oh. What the...

14:59.323 --> 15:00.322
What the...

15:11.680 --> 15:14.910
Are you kidding me?

15:21.140 --> 15:23.403
My God!

15:40.724 --> 15:41.855
Hello.

15:41.889 --> 15:43.520
Hey, Doris.
It's Olivia.

15:43.555 --> 15:45.852
You're checking up
on me, aren't you?

15:45.886 --> 15:47.250
I'm fine, darling.

15:47.285 --> 15:49.249
40 years here,
and I swear

15:49.283 --> 15:51.680
I'll never get used
to these earthquakes.

15:51.715 --> 15:53.079
I know, right?

15:53.113 --> 15:54.777
Hey, listen, is your power
out over there?

15:54.812 --> 15:56.110
Yeah,
couple minutes ago.

15:56.144 --> 15:57.775
Must be
the whole neighborhood.

15:57.810 --> 15:58.775
You need candles?

15:58.810 --> 15:59.840
No, no, no, I'm good.

15:59.874 --> 16:01.338
You okay?
I don't know.

16:01.373 --> 16:03.336
Colton was just here,
and he was ranting

16:03.371 --> 16:06.968
about some kind of a disaster, and
it actually shook me up a little.

16:07.003 --> 16:08.300
Earthquakes, fires,

16:08.334 --> 16:09.998
rolling blackouts,
mudslides,

16:10.033 --> 16:11.663
the Governator.
We're Californians.

16:11.699 --> 16:12.997
We've been
through worse.

16:13.031 --> 16:14.429
Yeah, I guess.

16:14.463 --> 16:15.628
Is he still home?

16:15.661 --> 16:17.758
No, no. He went
to go get Wyatt.

16:17.793 --> 16:19.625
They're gonna be back
in little bit.

16:21.525 --> 16:22.755
What now?

16:22.790 --> 16:24.954
Olivia, can you
hold on a second?

16:24.988 --> 16:26.919
Coco's barking. I need
to see what's going on.

16:26.953 --> 16:27.951
Yeah, sure.

16:33.814 --> 16:35.311
Coco.

16:37.477 --> 16:39.541
Coco!

16:39.576 --> 16:41.474
Where are you?

16:54.831 --> 16:57.961
Coco, where are you?

16:57.995 --> 17:00.158
Where have you gone?

17:06.655 --> 17:08.550
Why...

17:16.779 --> 17:19.211
Doris?

17:19.244 --> 17:20.407
Doris!

17:23.842 --> 17:25.872
Whoa.

17:25.906 --> 17:27.503
Hold on.
Whoa, look at that.

17:27.537 --> 17:28.802
Wow.
Whoa, guys.

17:28.837 --> 17:30.569
Hold up. Hold up.
Hold up.

17:30.603 --> 17:33.065
Oh, man.

17:38.562 --> 17:40.361
Who you think
happened here?

17:40.395 --> 17:42.192
The ground just started
breaking up.

17:42.226 --> 17:43.890
Looks like
a bomb hit.

17:43.925 --> 17:46.321
What?

17:51.851 --> 17:54.947
Hold up.
You smell that?

17:54.982 --> 17:56.512
That smells
like gas.

17:56.547 --> 17:58.479
Guys, let's get
out of here.

17:58.513 --> 18:00.210
Yeah, I'm with Wyatt.
Come on.

18:04.474 --> 18:06.404
Go! Go!

18:08.904 --> 18:11.134
Wyatt! Wyatt!

18:11.169 --> 18:13.300
Jordan, hold on!

18:14.733 --> 18:16.930
Come on! Come on!

18:16.965 --> 18:18.796
Something bit me.
Can you ride?

18:18.829 --> 18:20.162
Go!

18:20.196 --> 18:21.694
Go! Go!

18:21.728 --> 18:22.793
Go! Go! Go!

18:22.827 --> 18:24.358
Come on.

18:35.151 --> 18:36.115
Yo!

18:36.150 --> 18:37.514
Yo, stop!

18:37.548 --> 18:40.278
Yo! Yo! Yo!

18:40.313 --> 18:41.412
Stop!

18:41.446 --> 18:42.743
Stop! Stop! Stop!

18:42.778 --> 18:44.141
Please stop!

18:57.265 --> 18:59.663
What the heck
is that guy doing there?

18:59.697 --> 19:00.962
Hey!
Oh, my God.

19:00.996 --> 19:02.261
Hey! Hey, hey!

19:02.296 --> 19:03.259
Everyone...
Hey, stop!

19:03.294 --> 19:04.824
Stop! Hey!

19:04.859 --> 19:08.123
It's the Red Rocket
himself, Colton West!

19:08.157 --> 19:09.421
Hey!

19:09.455 --> 19:11.420
Look, look, no time
for a tour, okay?

19:11.454 --> 19:13.118
Did you not see
the volcano?

19:13.152 --> 19:14.784
There's a catastrophe
going on.

19:14.818 --> 19:16.616
No, no, it's just a
little earthquake, Colton.

19:16.650 --> 19:18.314
No. No. It's not
a little earthquake, man.

19:18.348 --> 19:19.946
You guys
are in a lot of trouble.

19:19.980 --> 19:21.545
You gotta get out of here.

19:21.579 --> 19:23.311
You gotta get these people
to a safe place.

19:23.345 --> 19:24.310
Look, what's your name?

19:24.344 --> 19:25.310
Joe.
Joe?

19:25.344 --> 19:26.607
Okay, Joe. Joe, I need...

19:26.642 --> 19:28.773
Joe, I need
your focus on me, okay?

19:28.807 --> 19:30.704
Joe, I need to get
downtown to get my son.

19:30.739 --> 19:31.737
Can you help me?

19:31.772 --> 19:32.969
But just first,
just get

19:33.004 --> 19:34.535
a quick little selfie.
Do you mind?

19:34.569 --> 19:35.800
No, Joe, we don't
have time for pictures.

19:35.835 --> 19:37.200
My wife would
just love this.

19:37.234 --> 19:38.865
Joe, just please...
just take me downtown.

19:38.899 --> 19:40.530
No, wait! Right.
No, no. No, better!

19:40.564 --> 19:41.730
You and the bus.

19:41.764 --> 19:43.060
It would be,
like, awesome PR,

19:43.095 --> 19:44.527
just right there
in front of the bus.

19:44.561 --> 19:46.259
Great, Joe.

19:46.293 --> 19:47.458
Joe, a shot right here,
right?

19:47.492 --> 19:48.890
Oh, you look nice.

19:48.924 --> 19:50.523
Need to move back
a little bit, Joe.

19:50.557 --> 19:51.755
Okay, okay, okay.
Move back a little bit, Joe.

19:51.789 --> 19:53.019
Okay, just keep moving back.
Okay.

19:53.053 --> 19:54.418
Yeah, keep moving back.
I got it.

19:54.453 --> 19:55.885
Yeah, yeah.
It's called a wide shot.

19:55.919 --> 19:57.083
A wide shot?
Wide shot, Joe.

19:57.117 --> 19:58.749
Yeah, yeah. Movie talk, Joe.
Okay.

19:58.783 --> 20:00.448
Movie talk. You're gonna
be making a movie with me.

20:00.482 --> 20:01.679
I'm making a movie
with Colton West.

20:01.714 --> 20:02.879
And then
you know what, Joe?

20:02.914 --> 20:04.211
Another movie talk
is camera left.

20:04.245 --> 20:05.443
That way. Exactly, Joe.

20:05.477 --> 20:06.610
Yeah. Yeah.
Okay, so...

20:06.644 --> 20:07.741
Yeah. Turn that way,
and look...

20:07.775 --> 20:09.074
Turn?
towards the trees, Joe.

20:09.108 --> 20:10.206
Aim the camera that way?
That's it.

20:10.241 --> 20:11.705
Okay.
Aim toward... You know,

20:11.739 --> 20:13.238
I'm gonna say, "Action",
Joe, like a movie.

20:13.272 --> 20:14.437
We're making
a great movie, Joe.

20:14.471 --> 20:15.702
Okay.
This is just so awesome.

20:15.736 --> 20:17.068
I mean, I'm such
a big fan of...

20:17.102 --> 20:18.866
And don't move
until I say, "Action."

20:18.900 --> 20:19.998
The second one
not so much,

20:20.032 --> 20:20.998
but the first one was...

20:21.032 --> 20:22.329
Action!
Hey!

20:22.363 --> 20:23.362
Hey!

20:23.396 --> 20:24.994
My bus! Ahh!

20:25.028 --> 20:27.893
Colton West took my bus!

20:32.389 --> 20:33.854
Thank you very much.

20:33.888 --> 20:36.519
I apologize for taking
control of your bus,

20:36.553 --> 20:39.016
but as you may
or may not know,

20:39.051 --> 20:41.181
there was an earthquake
today in Los Angeles

20:41.216 --> 20:43.745
that was caused by some
sort of volcanic activity

20:43.780 --> 20:45.411
in the Santa Monica
Mountains.

20:45.445 --> 20:49.341
Lava spiders erupted from
these mountains, spiders,

20:49.375 --> 20:51.372
spiders as big as men,

20:51.407 --> 20:54.871
and they rained down
on all of Los Angeles.

20:54.904 --> 20:56.369
<i>Colton, banzai!</i>

21:00.401 --> 21:01.399
Thanks, kid.

21:01.433 --> 21:03.064
<i>Banzai to you, too.</i>

21:12.757 --> 21:14.121
This way!

21:16.119 --> 21:17.748
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

21:23.473 --> 21:24.771
Follow me. Come on.

21:24.805 --> 21:25.802
Go! Go!

21:27.601 --> 21:29.032
Hurry up! Come on!

21:30.864 --> 21:32.060
Eli!

21:32.094 --> 21:34.057
I'm coming! I'm com...
Eli!

21:36.555 --> 21:38.150
Eli, no!

21:38.185 --> 21:39.714
Eli!

21:39.748 --> 21:40.714
Eli, no!

21:40.749 --> 21:42.510
Wyatt, let's go!

21:46.939 --> 21:48.003
Aah! Aah!

21:48.035 --> 21:49.035
What?!
What the hell!

21:50.035 --> 21:51.397
Travis!
Travis, here!

21:51.431 --> 21:52.662
Come here.
Come here.

21:56.191 --> 21:57.156
Let me...

21:58.322 --> 22:00.017
Jordan! Jordan!

22:00.051 --> 22:01.015
Dude, don't leave me.

22:01.049 --> 22:02.114
I'm right here!

22:02.149 --> 22:03.678
Don't touch it.

22:03.713 --> 22:06.342
Just get me
out of here, okay?

22:07.907 --> 22:09.935
Did you see what
those things did to Eli?

22:09.970 --> 22:11.533
What the hell
are those things?

22:11.567 --> 22:13.131
I don't know, man.

22:13.165 --> 22:14.763
It bit me.

22:14.797 --> 22:15.760
It bit you?

22:15.794 --> 22:16.859
What bit you?

22:16.893 --> 22:19.287
I said I don't know, man!

22:19.321 --> 22:21.817
Okay, listen.
Just stay here for a second.

22:21.852 --> 22:23.913
Okay. You watch her.
Hey, can you do that?

22:23.948 --> 22:25.179
Okay, I'm gonna get
the first-aid kit.

22:25.214 --> 22:26.843
Okay.

22:28.475 --> 22:30.871
I'm burnt so bad.

22:36.362 --> 22:37.993
Doris, are you in there?

22:38.028 --> 22:39.424
It's Olivia.

22:40.489 --> 22:41.853
Doris, are...

22:47.112 --> 22:48.608
What the...

23:10.110 --> 23:12.905
Oh, my God. What...

23:12.939 --> 23:15.900
Wyatt.

23:21.794 --> 23:25.186
Oh, man, the Red Rocket
is driving my tour bus.

23:25.221 --> 23:26.417
Somebody pinch me!

23:26.451 --> 23:28.182
Thanks a lot, kid.
I appreciate it.

23:28.217 --> 23:30.977
Uh, listen, I know that you
hear this all the time,

23:31.012 --> 23:32.842
but I am your biggest fan.
Yeah.

23:32.876 --> 23:33.841
Hi. I'm Chris.

23:33.875 --> 23:34.839
Chris.
Yeah.

23:34.873 --> 23:36.203
Not a good time to talk.

23:36.237 --> 23:37.800
No, no, I know.
With the earthquakes

23:37.835 --> 23:39.231
and everything
and the spiders.

23:39.265 --> 23:41.328
There are spiders, buddy.
No, no, no, I know.

23:41.363 --> 23:43.492
Big as your freaking body.
Big as my body.

23:43.526 --> 23:46.455
The thing is, is that I've
watched all your movies.

23:46.489 --> 23:48.784
I know all your lines.
Nice tattoo. Yah!

23:48.819 --> 23:51.713
Look, Chris, this is not a
good time to discuss film.

23:51.747 --> 23:53.211
Sure.
Sure, sure, sure, sure.

23:53.244 --> 23:54.842
But seriously,
am I on, like,

23:54.876 --> 23:56.539
a hidden-camera show
or something?

23:56.573 --> 23:59.300
'Cause I could have swore
I saw a camera right there.

23:59.335 --> 24:00.632
Yeah. Yeah. There's
cameras everywhere. Look...

24:00.666 --> 24:01.664
I knew it.

24:01.699 --> 24:03.096
you want to be
a good boy,

24:03.130 --> 24:05.359
tell everybody
to sit down and hold on.

24:05.393 --> 24:08.819
All right, I need everybody
to hold on and sit down.

24:08.853 --> 24:10.350
Colton West,
action hero!

24:12.981 --> 24:15.410
Yeah. See,
the problem is that,

24:15.444 --> 24:18.604
like, 90% of these people
don't speak any English.

24:21.302 --> 24:23.664
Uh, we got a problem
up ahead.

24:26.328 --> 24:27.857
I hate spiders.

24:29.255 --> 24:31.152
Aah! Aah!

24:31.186 --> 24:32.784
What the hell is that?

24:41.437 --> 24:43.067
Oh, homina.

24:44.932 --> 24:46.129
Chris!
What?

24:46.163 --> 24:47.361
Switching.

24:47.395 --> 24:49.359
Really?

24:49.392 --> 24:51.121
No fare, no ride.

24:52.255 --> 24:55.449
Gun! Awesome!

24:55.483 --> 24:56.480
Top!

25:00.242 --> 25:02.204
Ah, there's one on top now.

25:02.239 --> 25:03.536
You gotta do something.

25:03.570 --> 25:04.634
I am doing something.

25:07.198 --> 25:09.193
Do that thing like you did
in that movie.

25:09.228 --> 25:11.257
Chris, you know the difference
between real life and movies?

25:11.291 --> 25:12.256
No!
Darn.

25:12.290 --> 25:14.054
Well, what did I do?

25:14.088 --> 25:15.850
I don't know. You, like,
pulled the emergency brake,

25:15.884 --> 25:16.849
and it did
something cool.

25:16.883 --> 25:18.680
Oh, yeah.

25:18.714 --> 25:20.277
Whoo!

25:33.026 --> 25:35.719
Colton West, I love you!

25:35.754 --> 25:37.551
Ah ha.
I love you, too.

25:37.584 --> 25:38.982
Me, too.

25:39.016 --> 25:40.014
Calm down, Chris.
Okay.

25:45.206 --> 25:46.603
I'm not
getting anything.

25:46.638 --> 25:48.633
How the hell are
we supposed to know

25:48.667 --> 25:50.798
what's going on outside if we
don't have any cell service?

25:50.832 --> 25:52.327
Where did you
find that?

25:53.162 --> 25:54.887
Are you sure you know
what you're doing?

25:54.921 --> 25:56.378
You have to trust me, okay?

25:56.413 --> 25:57.640
We need to treat this.

26:00.164 --> 26:02.918
I know. I know.
I know. I know.

26:02.952 --> 26:06.368
You know, when I was a little kid,
I used to come here all the time.

26:08.360 --> 26:11.180
They would film
a ton of movies here,

26:11.215 --> 26:15.062
and when my dad was shooting,
he would bring me on set.

26:17.385 --> 26:19.508
All right, This is really
gonna hurt, all right?

26:19.542 --> 26:22.064
Ohh! Oh, you think?

26:23.359 --> 26:25.746
What the heck
are those things?

26:25.780 --> 26:27.405
Ah, they look
like spiders.

26:27.440 --> 26:29.165
Spiders aren't
that big.

26:29.199 --> 26:32.084
Spiders don't spray
hot lava.

26:32.118 --> 26:33.477
Spiders...
I don't know, man. I don't know.

26:33.512 --> 26:34.639
It looked like
some kind of spider, though.

26:34.673 --> 26:36.697
Oh, it burns so bad.

26:38.091 --> 26:40.016
We gotta get some help.

26:40.050 --> 26:41.441
Maybe if we go up higher,

26:41.476 --> 26:43.233
we'd get some cell service,
something.

26:43.267 --> 26:45.125
Sure as hell ain't
going back outside.

26:47.250 --> 26:48.311
Okay.

26:48.346 --> 26:49.671
You guys smell that?

26:52.759 --> 26:54.716
They're trying
to get in.

26:58.366 --> 27:00.190
They're trying to get
in! Let's get out of here!

27:00.225 --> 27:01.319
Okay. We gotta go.
We gotta go.

27:01.353 --> 27:02.314
Come on. Can you walk?

27:02.348 --> 27:04.670
Do I have a choice?
No.

27:04.704 --> 27:07.127
Come on.

27:07.160 --> 27:08.153
Come on. Let's go.
Let's go. Come on.

27:14.758 --> 27:17.346
Come on. Come on.

27:18.608 --> 27:19.569
Crap.

27:21.628 --> 27:24.348
As we continue
to bring you coverage

27:24.383 --> 27:25.675
of the L.A. eruptions,

27:25.709 --> 27:28.064
new details are emerging
by the minute.

27:28.099 --> 27:29.824
We've got exclusive footage

27:29.857 --> 27:32.843
of the damage from this
amazing volcanic activity.

27:32.876 --> 27:34.503
Now, the entire area
around the 405

27:34.536 --> 27:37.986
is closed from the 110
to the I-5

27:38.020 --> 27:41.140
while rescue crews scramble
to evacuate survivors

27:41.174 --> 27:42.598
and put out fires

27:42.632 --> 27:44.888
that are spreading
across the Sepulveda basin.

27:44.923 --> 27:49.369
Now, this one can be filed
under only in Hollyweird.

27:49.403 --> 27:54.079
We have unconfirmed reports
of a new breed of arachnids

27:54.113 --> 27:58.493
like these from the Hollywood
blockbuster "Spiders 3D"

27:58.527 --> 28:01.048
that have supposedly
been attacking Angelenos.

28:01.082 --> 28:02.309
That's right.

28:02.343 --> 28:04.400
Large, seemingly
prehistoric spiders

28:04.434 --> 28:06.688
have been emerging
from the chaos,

28:06.723 --> 28:08.184
and for more of this,

28:08.217 --> 28:11.170
we're gonna go to Sue Schnell
and her crew,

28:11.204 --> 28:13.657
who finally have been moved
to a safer location.

28:13.692 --> 28:15.084
Sue, what can you tell us?

28:15.118 --> 28:16.313
That's right, Dan.

28:16.347 --> 28:17.607
As you can see behind me here,

28:17.640 --> 28:19.166
the National Guard
has been called in

28:19.200 --> 28:21.389
to work
with local law enforcement

28:21.423 --> 28:24.874
to establish a safe perimeter
around the disaster zone.

28:24.908 --> 28:26.932
Although I haven't seen
anything myself,

28:26.964 --> 28:29.022
social media is all over this,

28:29.055 --> 28:31.012
with reports of giant
fire-breathing spiders

28:31.046 --> 28:33.235
that have only added
to the mayhem

28:33.269 --> 28:34.431
that has gripped the region.

28:34.465 --> 28:36.022
Excuse me?

28:38.014 --> 28:41.631
In other news, related or not,

28:41.665 --> 28:44.883
Colton West has apparently
hijacked a tour bus.

28:44.918 --> 28:46.675
Folks, we'll be back
in just a minute.

28:47.704 --> 28:49.661
What?

28:49.695 --> 28:50.689
Ohh.

28:56.431 --> 28:58.753
Okay. Okay.

28:58.787 --> 29:00.843
Okay.

29:13.786 --> 29:16.075
Let's do this.

29:42.788 --> 29:44.546
What are you waiting for?

29:55.067 --> 29:58.384
You messed
with the wrong house.

30:02.566 --> 30:04.589
I wanna get
a picture with the spider.

30:06.681 --> 30:09.299
Uh, Mr. West,
what do you think

30:09.333 --> 30:11.125
is in the blood
of these things?

30:11.160 --> 30:13.017
I don't want
to study 'em, Chris.

30:13.052 --> 30:14.609
I just want
to kill 'em.

30:14.644 --> 30:16.302
Yeah. Well,
whatever it is,

30:16.337 --> 30:17.962
it's eating
through the bus.

30:17.996 --> 30:20.317
What do you think happens
when it hits gas?

30:20.351 --> 30:22.367
Hang on, everybody.
Hang on!

30:26.621 --> 30:27.752
Everybody off!
Go!

30:27.786 --> 30:29.616
Everybody off!
Go! Go! Go!

30:29.651 --> 30:30.881
Everybody
off now!

30:30.916 --> 30:32.312
Go! Go! Go!

30:32.346 --> 30:33.745
Go! Go! Go!

30:33.779 --> 30:35.342
I'm last.
Go! Go! Go!

30:37.108 --> 30:38.305
Go! Go! Go! Go!

30:38.339 --> 30:39.637
Get off!
Let's go!

30:39.671 --> 30:41.235
Come on!

30:49.126 --> 30:51.055
Oh, my God!

30:51.090 --> 30:54.020
Everybody's off
that bus, aren't they?

30:54.053 --> 30:55.084
Yeah.

30:55.118 --> 30:57.083
Clear the area!

30:57.117 --> 30:58.447
You saved us.

30:58.481 --> 31:00.910
No.
You're the man!

31:00.944 --> 31:02.243
I didn't save anybody.

31:02.277 --> 31:03.907
Yeah.

31:03.941 --> 31:06.904
We still got act two
and act three to go.

31:06.938 --> 31:08.734
Movie talk.

31:08.769 --> 31:09.733
Yeah.

31:09.768 --> 31:10.831
Yeah.

31:10.866 --> 31:13.229
Movie talk.

31:14.694 --> 31:16.592
But now for many Angelenos

31:16.626 --> 31:19.222
who are used to the shaking
and the fires,

31:19.256 --> 31:20.985
it's as if nothing
is happening,

31:21.019 --> 31:22.351
and for that story,

31:22.385 --> 31:24.148
we have Ed Mendez
on Hollywood Boulevard.

31:24.182 --> 31:25.747
Ed, what can you tell us?

31:25.781 --> 31:27.511
Thanks, Dan. And it is true

31:27.545 --> 31:29.975
that business and
leisure go on as usual,

31:30.008 --> 31:31.573
and most people
either haven't heard

31:31.607 --> 31:33.336
about these disasters
across town,

31:33.370 --> 31:35.135
or they simply
don't believe it,

31:35.169 --> 31:36.965
but that is quickly changing.

31:36.999 --> 31:40.627
Now, we are just blocks away
from where a tour bus exploded,

31:40.662 --> 31:42.625
rocking Hollywood Boulevard,

31:42.660 --> 31:45.656
shattering windows,
and setting off car alarms.

31:45.690 --> 31:47.885
There is so much smoke
in the area.

31:47.920 --> 31:50.881
This is as close as we can
possibly get to the scene,

31:50.916 --> 31:52.680
but I can tell you this much.

31:52.715 --> 31:54.445
Some of the passengers
were terrified,

31:54.479 --> 31:56.674
and they're claiming
that creatures

31:56.709 --> 32:00.137
they believe are spiders
attacked their bus,

32:00.172 --> 32:03.633
a literal avalanche
of lava-breathing spiders,

32:03.667 --> 32:05.298
lavalantulas.

32:05.332 --> 32:07.994
Were there any casualties
in this explosion?

32:08.028 --> 32:10.924
No. Apparently Colton West,

32:10.958 --> 32:14.819
who we're hearing hijacked that
very bus just moments earlier,

32:14.853 --> 32:18.481
was able to get everybody
to safety before it blew.

32:18.516 --> 32:19.813
Thank you, Ed.

32:19.846 --> 32:21.178
Okay. We're gonna
bring you more

32:21.212 --> 32:22.609
from the Santa Monica
Mountains,

32:22.643 --> 32:23.841
where the fire crews

32:23.876 --> 32:25.506
are struggling
to contain the chaos.

32:25.539 --> 32:27.770
Come on. Come on.

32:27.804 --> 32:29.800
Okay, okay.
Okay, I need a break.

32:29.834 --> 32:31.897
I need a break.
All right, all right.

32:31.931 --> 32:33.962
Grab that. Grab that.
Come on. Sit down.

32:33.996 --> 32:35.992
Okay.

32:36.027 --> 32:39.488
Ah, jeez.
Still no signal.

32:39.522 --> 32:41.320
Wonder if the cell
towers are all out?

32:41.354 --> 32:42.751
The roof is gonna be our only
chance to get out of here.

32:42.785 --> 32:44.249
But If all
the cell towers are out,

32:44.283 --> 32:45.747
how are we gonna
get in touch with anyone?

32:45.781 --> 32:47.213
I gotta flag down a
helicopter or something.

32:47.246 --> 32:48.710
I don't even know.

32:48.744 --> 32:50.907
Hey, Wyatt,
come here for a second.

32:50.942 --> 32:52.306
What?

32:52.340 --> 32:56.234
Dude, I think
I should stay here with her

32:56.268 --> 32:58.565
while you go call for help.

32:58.598 --> 33:00.130
Okay. Okay.
Yeah, that's good.

33:00.163 --> 33:01.227
Cool. All right.

33:01.261 --> 33:02.759
All right.
Good luck, man.

33:02.793 --> 33:03.958
Come here. Come here.

33:03.993 --> 33:05.290
Easy.

33:05.323 --> 33:07.720
Travis, are you
trying to hit on her?

33:07.754 --> 33:10.516
Dude, you did the whole
bandage hero thing back there.

33:10.551 --> 33:11.781
Gotta get
my game in sometime.

33:11.816 --> 33:13.846
Travis. Travis,
she's injured.

33:13.880 --> 33:16.709
There are fire-breathing
spiders chasing us right now.

33:16.743 --> 33:18.872
What is wrong with you?
Come on, man.

33:18.907 --> 33:20.537
It's my only angle, okay?

33:20.571 --> 33:21.868
It's your only angle?

33:21.903 --> 33:24.099
You gotta
be kidding me.

33:27.430 --> 33:29.327
Mm-hmm. Yep.
Okay, we gotta go.

33:29.362 --> 33:30.625
Come on. Come on.
Let's get out of here.

33:37.386 --> 33:39.381
This is a mandatory evac,
boys.

33:39.415 --> 33:41.311
No one is to be left
behind. you understand?

33:41.345 --> 33:43.775
If you see any of those
spiders, you don't even hesitate.

33:43.809 --> 33:45.638
You shoot to kill.
Got it.

33:45.673 --> 33:47.601
Rico, Lance, I want you to take
the north side of the street.

33:47.635 --> 33:48.867
Hernandez, I want you
to come with me.

33:48.901 --> 33:50.298
All right, let's go.

33:50.332 --> 33:52.562
All right, let's go.
Move it. Move it.

34:06.541 --> 34:08.503
What took you
so long?

34:08.538 --> 34:09.799
We gotta get you
out of here.

34:09.833 --> 34:11.297
We're evacuating
the whole neighborhood.

34:11.333 --> 34:13.628
Lead the way.

34:25.478 --> 34:26.197
Any luck?

34:26.232 --> 34:27.411
No. You got a phone?

34:27.706 --> 34:28.670
No.

34:28.886 --> 34:29.915
What's his name?

34:29.949 --> 34:31.282
Wyatt.

34:31.315 --> 34:33.045
Like Wyatt Earp?

34:33.080 --> 34:34.510
Yeah, like Wyatt Earp.

34:34.543 --> 34:36.009
So what's next?

34:36.042 --> 34:37.373
Next?

34:37.407 --> 34:39.770
Next is you go home.
No.

34:39.804 --> 34:41.768
You go to Kansas
or Louisiana

34:41.802 --> 34:43.664
or Wyoming,
and you get safe.

34:43.699 --> 34:44.764
That's what next.

34:44.797 --> 34:46.561
Des Moines. Yeah.
Des Moines.

34:46.596 --> 34:47.925
Argh, maties.

34:47.960 --> 34:50.255
Who wants their photo
with Pirate Jack?

34:50.290 --> 34:51.489
Argh!

34:51.523 --> 34:53.085
Colton West?

34:53.120 --> 34:54.516
Yeah.

34:54.551 --> 34:55.848
It's me,
Dave Alexander.

34:55.882 --> 34:57.513
I did stunts
on "Swamp Justice"...

34:57.547 --> 34:58.745
Dave!
like, 20 years ago.

34:58.778 --> 34:59.909
Dave Alexander,
yeah.

34:59.944 --> 35:01.074
Yeah. Yeah.
You look great.

35:01.109 --> 35:02.240
Thanks.
I... I lost an arm

35:02.274 --> 35:03.839
on the set
a couple years ago.

35:03.873 --> 35:05.469
Stunt went bad.

35:05.502 --> 35:07.034
Sorry to hear about it.
You got pigeonholed, huh?

35:07.068 --> 35:09.064
Yeah. Not a lot of work
for a one-armed stunt guy.

35:09.099 --> 35:12.059
Look, Dave, we got
a problem here!

35:12.094 --> 35:13.325
I know.
I saw your bus.

35:13.359 --> 35:15.023
Phew!
No, we...

35:15.057 --> 35:16.554
Look, I got this.
Pirate Jack.

35:16.588 --> 35:18.851
Dave.
Dave, sorry.

35:18.885 --> 35:20.317
This city is
in great danger, okay?

35:20.351 --> 35:22.179
The earthquakes
are unleashing giant spiders

35:22.213 --> 35:23.978
that are attacking
the city.

35:25.342 --> 35:26.707
You don't know
about this?

35:26.741 --> 35:28.271
Oh, the helicopters
and the smoke and all?

35:28.305 --> 35:30.136
I just figured it was
another fire in the hills.

35:30.171 --> 35:32.632
No. There's a volcano in the
hills the size of Vesuvius.

35:32.666 --> 35:34.097
So this spider thing's
for real?

35:34.131 --> 35:35.861
Yes.
Look, Pirate Jack,

35:35.896 --> 35:37.958
we just need to get
downtown to his son.

35:37.993 --> 35:39.756
You got a car,
a truck, anything?

35:39.791 --> 35:41.287
Yeah, I can give you a lift.
Great.

35:41.322 --> 35:42.785
Let's go get a beer.
It's been too long.

35:42.819 --> 35:43.984
We don't have time.

35:44.018 --> 35:46.081
Dave, please,
take me downtown.

35:46.115 --> 35:47.646
All right, Colt. Jeez.

35:49.345 --> 35:51.107
It's happening again.

35:51.142 --> 35:53.105
These earthquakes are
getting on my nerves.

35:53.140 --> 35:54.636
You find somewhere safe.

35:54.671 --> 35:56.101
We gotta warn people.

35:56.135 --> 35:57.832
What about the ride?

35:57.867 --> 35:59.329
Get off the street!
Go!

35:59.363 --> 36:01.161
Everybody, get off
the street! Take cover!

36:01.195 --> 36:02.259
Everybody,
get off the street!

36:02.293 --> 36:03.624
Get off the street!

36:03.659 --> 36:05.655
Look, make sure
everybody finds cover

36:05.689 --> 36:07.319
and everybody gets safe.
You got me?

36:07.353 --> 36:08.785
Yeah.
Okay.

36:08.819 --> 36:09.981
So, I'm... I'm,
like, your costar.

36:10.016 --> 36:11.247
Yeah,
You're my costar.

36:11.281 --> 36:12.246
Yeah.
Right, right.

36:12.280 --> 36:13.378
Just meet me
back here.

36:13.412 --> 36:14.377
Don't lose me!

36:14.411 --> 36:15.576
Okay. Okay.

36:15.610 --> 36:16.806
Get the hell
out of here!

36:16.840 --> 36:18.538
Dan, I have to tell you,

36:18.573 --> 36:20.234
there is a growing feeling...
This is an emergency!

36:20.268 --> 36:21.934
that these reports
of spiders

36:21.968 --> 36:24.031
are actually
part of publicity stunt

36:24.064 --> 36:26.692
for an upcoming
Hollywood blockbuster.

36:26.727 --> 36:28.725
Oh, God.

36:28.759 --> 36:30.122
Oh, my God.

36:56.088 --> 36:57.419
Run!

36:57.453 --> 36:59.482
Everybody get off
the streets!

36:59.517 --> 37:01.181
Girls, get off the streets!
There are giant spiders!

37:01.215 --> 37:03.179
Everybody, get off the
street! Get off the street!

37:03.212 --> 37:04.809
Hey...
Hey. Hey!

37:04.843 --> 37:06.174
Colton West! Nice shotgun.
Yeah!

37:06.208 --> 37:08.305
I know you.
I know you from...

37:08.339 --> 37:09.569
Look, you gotta
get off the streets.

37:09.603 --> 37:11.367
There's giant spiders
everywhere.

37:11.402 --> 37:14.063
I'd love to help you, but I
got shark problems right now.

37:57.007 --> 37:58.736
Yeah! Yeah.

37:59.803 --> 38:01.168
You're welcome, kid.

38:01.202 --> 38:02.199
Yeah!

38:07.559 --> 38:10.054
Die! Die! Die!

38:14.383 --> 38:15.680
Gotta get outta here.

38:15.714 --> 38:17.112
Yeah.
This way!

38:22.539 --> 38:23.536
Get in!

38:24.636 --> 38:26.365
Jack.

38:28.832 --> 38:31.959
Go! Go! Go!
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

38:41.181 --> 38:42.245
Keep moving, people.

38:42.280 --> 38:44.809
On the truck.
On the truck.

38:44.843 --> 38:46.405
Go ahead, too.

38:46.440 --> 38:48.070
All the way to the front.
All the way to the front.

38:50.235 --> 38:52.697
Let's go.
Come on.

38:57.586 --> 38:59.050
Where are we going?

38:59.084 --> 39:00.714
We're going
out of the city.

39:00.749 --> 39:02.412
How bad is this?

39:02.447 --> 39:04.178
It's bad. The city's
completely unstable.

39:04.212 --> 39:05.883
Los Angeles is under
a military evac.

39:06.276 --> 39:09.462
No, no, no. Wait. Wait. I... I can't
just leave. My family is still out there.

39:09.474 --> 39:10.782
All right. You don't
have a choice, all right?

39:10.805 --> 39:13.369
This is martial law.
Excuse me?

39:13.805 --> 39:14.801
Listen,
I'm sorry, ma'am.

39:14.835 --> 39:16.168
This is completely
unprecedented.

39:16.202 --> 39:17.294
We weren't prepared
for this.

39:17.532 --> 39:18.649
I'm not leaving
without my family.

39:18.733 --> 39:19.797
I need to find them.

39:19.831 --> 39:21.962
We'll find your family,
I promise you,

39:21.996 --> 39:23.099
if they're still alive.

39:30.887 --> 39:33.051
Move it out! Let's go!

39:41.145 --> 39:42.910
Hey, what happened
to your parrot?

39:42.944 --> 39:45.373
How could you possibly care
about something like that now?

39:45.408 --> 39:47.171
Giant spiders
are trying to kill us.

39:47.205 --> 39:49.070
I didn't think you guys
were serious about these.

39:49.104 --> 39:50.334
Well, of course
we're serious.

39:50.367 --> 39:52.733
Oh, they took out
the Blue Oyster.

39:52.768 --> 39:53.998
I love that place.

39:54.032 --> 39:55.864
Jack, just get us
downtown.

39:55.898 --> 39:57.761
How is this even possible?
How is this happening?

39:57.795 --> 39:59.428
Well, you know,
just last week,

39:59.462 --> 40:02.191
they found a new species
of wasp in the Chinese jungle,

40:02.226 --> 40:04.256
eight-inch wingspan,
four-inch stinger.

40:04.290 --> 40:05.886
Well, these things are a
lot bigger than eight inches!

40:05.921 --> 40:08.251
I'm just saying.
New species, my ass.

40:08.285 --> 40:11.415
This is that Japanese radiation
leak making its way over.

40:11.449 --> 40:13.047
Guys, let's stop
discussing biology!

40:13.081 --> 40:15.745
Get me downtown
so I can get my son!

40:18.909 --> 40:20.308
Come on.

40:20.341 --> 40:23.504
We gotta go faster.
Come on.

40:23.538 --> 40:25.836
I can't. I can't
go any further.

40:25.870 --> 40:27.034
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
I need to sit down.

40:27.067 --> 40:28.199
Okay. Whoa.
Sit down.

40:28.233 --> 40:29.331
It hurts so bad.

40:29.366 --> 40:30.898
What, is it too tight?
Uh-huh.

40:30.933 --> 40:32.628
Okay. Let me see.
Let me see.

40:32.663 --> 40:34.427
Okay, come on.

40:36.426 --> 40:39.521
Oh, God. Ohh!
Oh, my God.

40:39.556 --> 40:41.155
Shut up. Shut up.
Shut up. Hey, shut up.

40:41.190 --> 40:42.219
Shut up. It's fine.
It's not that bad.

40:42.253 --> 40:43.553
Are you freaking
kidding me?

40:43.587 --> 40:44.851
She's too young
to die, bro.

40:44.885 --> 40:46.616
Shut up.
Calm down. Calm down.

40:46.651 --> 40:48.946
We can't panic
right now, okay? Calm down.

40:48.980 --> 40:51.479
You can't freak out
on me right now, okay?

40:51.513 --> 40:52.476
Come on.

40:52.510 --> 40:53.675
I gotta get to the roof.

40:53.711 --> 40:55.161
Man,
you can't leave us.

40:55.196 --> 40:55.940
Just stay
with her, man.

40:55.974 --> 40:57.506
We gotta try.

40:59.038 --> 41:00.536
Whoa!
Come on! We gotta go!

41:00.571 --> 41:01.935
Back! Back! Back!
Come on.

41:01.969 --> 41:02.933
Come on!

41:02.967 --> 41:05.265
Go!

41:05.299 --> 41:07.496
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

41:11.993 --> 41:13.691
What the hell is that?

41:13.725 --> 41:16.287
What the hell?!
Lava! Lava!

41:27.312 --> 41:28.444
Why are we stopping?

41:28.478 --> 41:30.108
Something's wrong.

41:35.538 --> 41:39.200
This is gonna get bad
really, really fast.

41:40.266 --> 41:41.731
Let's get out of here.

41:41.766 --> 41:43.396
We're not going anywhere.

41:43.430 --> 41:45.328
Ah, man,
these were brand-new.

41:45.362 --> 41:48.324
Uh, fellas, look!

41:48.358 --> 41:50.589
That's not good.

41:50.623 --> 41:51.921
Holy...
Oh, that's bad.

41:51.956 --> 41:53.254
I had a feeling
this was gonna happen.

41:53.289 --> 41:54.386
Oh, hey, Colton,
any ideas?

41:54.420 --> 41:55.652
What do we do?
What do we do?

41:55.686 --> 41:57.649
Man, I hate being right.

41:57.684 --> 41:59.980
Get in the museum!
Why the museum?

42:00.015 --> 42:02.479
Because that's the only
building without spiders on it!

42:02.513 --> 42:05.442
Not yet, but they look
pretty determined.

42:07.474 --> 42:09.537
Barricade the doors!

42:09.572 --> 42:12.302
Close them up!
Close them up!

42:12.336 --> 42:13.967
Come on!
Throw everything you can!

42:18.431 --> 42:20.361
Come on! Hurry up!

42:20.395 --> 42:21.926
Anything!
Just grab anything!

42:21.960 --> 42:22.958
Jam it up.

42:24.059 --> 42:25.023
I got one more.

42:25.057 --> 42:26.989
I got one more.

42:29.121 --> 42:30.951
You feel safe?

42:30.986 --> 42:31.950
Not even
a little bit.

42:31.985 --> 42:33.083
No.
You got a plan?

42:33.117 --> 42:34.083
Uh, run.

42:34.117 --> 42:35.115
Run! Run!
Run!

42:40.278 --> 42:42.173
Gotta get
out of here.

42:42.207 --> 42:44.006
We're not getting out of
here. There's spiders outside.

42:44.040 --> 42:45.239
We gotta find
somewhere to hide.

42:45.273 --> 42:46.768
There's nowhere to hide.

42:46.803 --> 42:49.701
When those things want
to find you, they will.

42:49.735 --> 42:50.767
Who are you?

42:50.801 --> 42:53.064
I am Dr. Erik
Von Struebel.

42:53.098 --> 42:54.396
I work here
in the museum.

42:54.430 --> 42:55.695
What are you
still doing here?

42:55.729 --> 42:58.327
I'm a scientist.
For good or bad,

42:58.361 --> 43:01.157
these are the kind of
moments that we live for.

43:01.191 --> 43:02.322
Well, you're not gonna
live for much longer

43:02.356 --> 43:03.753
if you stick around
here, Doc.

43:03.788 --> 43:07.184
Yes. I am acutely aware
of that possibility,

43:07.220 --> 43:08.848
but I'm not done.

43:08.883 --> 43:10.048
Done?

43:10.082 --> 43:11.081
Done with what?

43:16.577 --> 43:20.405
The heat grid is like
an interconnected network,

43:20.439 --> 43:22.070
lava tubes probably,

43:22.104 --> 43:25.134
with the temperature
increasing exponentially.

43:25.168 --> 43:27.333
So why didn't anybody say
anything about this before?

43:27.367 --> 43:29.629
We didn't see it coming.

43:29.664 --> 43:31.827
It happened too quickly.

43:31.862 --> 43:33.560
I mean, we're talking
five days ago,

43:33.594 --> 43:36.056
and it's like,
"Oh, that's odd."

43:36.090 --> 43:40.387
Then under a week later,
the hills are active volcanoes.

43:40.421 --> 43:43.117
What should have taken
over a million years

43:43.151 --> 43:45.714
almost happened
overnight.

43:45.749 --> 43:47.180
So if this is correct,

43:47.213 --> 43:48.878
this explains
why these things

43:48.913 --> 43:50.311
are exploding
all over the city.

43:50.345 --> 43:53.308
This city
is a ticking time bomb.

43:53.342 --> 43:56.007
Wait. What does this have to do
with spiders attacking the city?

43:56.042 --> 43:58.871
Actually, everything.

43:58.906 --> 44:03.855
When I compared the pattern
of the lava tube network,

44:03.890 --> 44:08.288
it had a very close structure
to that of an insect colony.

44:08.323 --> 44:09.958
So wait. They had
something in common?

44:09.993 --> 44:11.983
They're exactly
the same.

44:12.125 --> 44:15.874
The volcanoes
and the spiders are one.

44:16.620 --> 44:19.174
The Mayans
had a term for it,

44:19.352 --> 44:21.473
lavalantula.

44:22.682 --> 44:24.144
And right here...

44:25.512 --> 44:27.909
this would be
the queen's chamber.

44:27.943 --> 44:33.138
If you kill the Mamalantula,
you kill them all.

44:35.835 --> 44:36.933
Whoa.

44:39.032 --> 44:40.730
We better go check
on that front door.

44:40.764 --> 44:41.796
What are you doing?

44:41.830 --> 44:43.727
Science class
is over, Doc.

44:43.761 --> 44:47.390
I'm gonna go get my kid,
and when we're done,

44:47.425 --> 44:50.121
you and I, Jack, we're
gonna have that beer.

44:50.155 --> 44:51.154
You're buying.

44:53.018 --> 44:55.581
Oh, that is so badass.

44:55.615 --> 44:58.446
Wait. No, no, no.

44:58.481 --> 45:00.743
I... I meant you're badass,
not I'm badass.

45:00.778 --> 45:02.309
Guys?

45:02.343 --> 45:03.341
Colt?

45:10.570 --> 45:12.866
Come in, Evac 670.
What's your 20?

45:12.900 --> 45:14.132
This is Evac 670.

45:14.166 --> 45:16.129
We are westbound
on Forest Lawn.

45:16.163 --> 45:18.129
670, turn around
immediately.

45:18.162 --> 45:20.593
The Forest Lawn area is
highly unstable right now.

45:20.627 --> 45:22.091
Do you have
an alternate route?

45:22.125 --> 45:23.789
Negative, just get
off that road.

45:24.823 --> 45:26.420
What's happening?

45:26.455 --> 45:28.584
Want you to stay here.

45:28.618 --> 45:30.616
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. You
can't just leave us here.

45:30.651 --> 45:32.049
All right.
I want you to get down,

45:32.084 --> 45:34.579
and I want you
to stay down.

45:34.613 --> 45:36.511
This should keep you safe.
- On your six!

45:36.546 --> 45:38.408
I'm not good at staying down.

45:38.443 --> 45:41.340
If you want to live, you get
that ass under that fire blanket.

45:42.374 --> 45:44.336
Really need to curse.

45:44.371 --> 45:46.436
Get down!

45:49.698 --> 45:51.164
This place is like
a freaking maze.

45:51.198 --> 45:52.563
I think there's
a stairwell right there.

45:52.597 --> 45:55.360
Oh, you think?

46:07.716 --> 46:09.248
These things
don't give up.

46:09.282 --> 46:11.744
Shh, shh, shh, shh.
Keep your voice down.

46:11.779 --> 46:13.010
Come on. Come on.

46:24.767 --> 46:26.399
Okay, come on.
Come on.

46:26.433 --> 46:28.061
Let's go. Let's go.
Let's go. Let's go.

46:28.095 --> 46:29.496
God.

46:29.529 --> 46:31.293
I think it's gone.

46:32.593 --> 46:34.989
Run! Go! Go!

46:35.024 --> 46:36.655
You got her?

46:36.690 --> 46:38.085
You got her?
Come on! Here it comes!

46:40.319 --> 46:41.484
What the hell
are you doing?

46:41.518 --> 46:42.483
I got this!

46:49.011 --> 46:50.009
I got it!

46:53.140 --> 46:54.470
How'd you know
that was gonna work?

46:54.504 --> 46:55.503
I didn't!

46:59.233 --> 47:01.365
Go!

47:04.961 --> 47:06.792
There's too many
of them, man!

47:06.827 --> 47:09.323
We gotta get these
civilians out of here.

47:09.358 --> 47:10.857
They breathe fire, man.

47:10.890 --> 47:11.888
Yeah,
I can see that.

47:14.321 --> 47:16.984
Now they're
closing in.

47:17.018 --> 47:19.115
We are not going
down like this.

47:19.148 --> 47:20.413
Do you have a shot?
Yeah.

47:21.979 --> 47:22.977
Run!

47:26.442 --> 47:27.973
We gotta move now, man.

47:28.007 --> 47:29.138
Yeah, and do what?

47:29.173 --> 47:30.771
We gonna head back
to the city?

47:30.806 --> 47:32.168
Well, we can't go
this way, man.

47:32.202 --> 47:33.335
Yeah, but we need
reinforcements.

47:33.369 --> 47:35.666
Man, we are
the reinforcements!

47:42.993 --> 47:44.325
Clever girl.

48:24.921 --> 48:27.449
Oh, no.

48:45.769 --> 48:48.131
Oh! Eww, eww, eww.

48:50.197 --> 48:51.428
Oh, my God.

48:56.059 --> 48:57.421
Key.

48:57.457 --> 48:59.188
Oh.

49:01.154 --> 49:04.015
Evac 670,
can you read me?

49:04.050 --> 49:05.447
Hello?

49:05.482 --> 49:06.946
Did you copy
the last transmission?

49:06.980 --> 49:08.842
Get off Forest Lawn.

49:08.876 --> 49:10.141
All your men are gone.

49:10.175 --> 49:12.239
Everyone is dead.
Do you hear me?

49:12.273 --> 49:13.838
Who is this?

49:13.872 --> 49:15.901
My name is Olivia West.

49:15.936 --> 49:18.332
I'm the sole survivor.
Well, please be advised

49:18.366 --> 49:20.396
to get out of
Los Angeles immediately.

49:20.430 --> 49:21.727
Yeah. Well, thanks
for the great advice,

49:21.761 --> 49:22.892
but I can't
really do that.

49:22.927 --> 49:24.490
My family is
still here in L.A.

49:24.524 --> 49:27.152
Repeat. Los Angeles is
highly unstable right now.

49:27.187 --> 49:29.384
Why don't you give me
some good information,

49:29.418 --> 49:30.982
like where's
the fricking key?

49:31.017 --> 49:32.446
There is no key, ma'am.

49:32.480 --> 49:34.977
Flip two switches marked
"battery" and "run."

49:35.012 --> 49:38.607
You're advised to get
out as soon as possible.

49:38.642 --> 49:40.170
Not without my family.

49:49.925 --> 49:51.190
Come on.

49:51.223 --> 49:52.188
You still with us?

49:52.222 --> 49:53.286
How you doing?

49:53.320 --> 49:54.452
How you doing, Jordan?
Jordan!

49:54.486 --> 49:55.584
Jordan!

49:56.717 --> 49:57.681
Jordan!

49:57.716 --> 49:58.846
Jordan.
Whoa, whoa.

49:58.881 --> 49:59.879
She's freaking out, man.

49:59.913 --> 50:01.776
Jordan, come on.
Come on.

50:01.810 --> 50:03.240
Jordan, look at me.
Look at me.

50:03.274 --> 50:04.506
Water, water.
Get some water.

50:04.540 --> 50:05.938
From where?
I don't know, man.

50:05.973 --> 50:07.935
Jordan, look at me.
No, come on.

50:07.970 --> 50:09.532
Jordan! Jordan!

50:09.566 --> 50:11.730
Jordan! Jordan!
Come on.

50:11.765 --> 50:13.361
Stay with us.
Come on.

50:13.826 --> 50:14.792
Jordan.

50:14.826 --> 50:15.792
What the...

50:15.826 --> 50:17.490
Is she dead?

50:18.625 --> 50:20.223
I don't know.

50:27.890 --> 50:31.122
Jordan! Jordan!

50:32.387 --> 50:33.954
Ho. Dude.

50:35.588 --> 50:38.320
Jordan.

50:42.653 --> 50:44.051
What's happening?!
No! No!

50:44.085 --> 50:45.219
What's happening?!
Oh, my God!

50:45.254 --> 50:47.284
Make it stop!

50:47.319 --> 50:48.452
Oh, my God!

50:48.486 --> 50:50.416
What the...

50:50.450 --> 50:52.216
No! No!

50:53.985 --> 50:54.950
Get 'em off me, man!

50:54.984 --> 50:56.015
No! Ahh!

50:59.083 --> 51:00.748
No! No! Ahh!

51:07.080 --> 51:09.047
Come on. Come on.

51:14.911 --> 51:15.910
Right.

51:23.443 --> 51:24.943
Where are you?

51:29.474 --> 51:31.041
My phone.

51:31.075 --> 51:32.874
My phone's working.

51:32.908 --> 51:34.506
It's from Wyatt.

51:34.540 --> 51:36.040
Heh.

51:36.074 --> 51:37.172
He's trapped.

51:37.206 --> 51:39.339
He's at Hanson Studios.

51:39.373 --> 51:41.238
It's at Seventh and Olympic.
We gotta get there.

51:41.272 --> 51:42.804
Hey, guys.

51:45.405 --> 51:48.202
That is
a very large arachnid.

51:57.535 --> 51:58.801
The freaking kraken.

52:00.467 --> 52:01.533
And it's coming
this way.

52:01.568 --> 52:02.533
Get back!

52:02.568 --> 52:03.733
Lavalantula!

52:11.598 --> 52:12.898
Ah, no!

52:12.933 --> 52:14.530
Ah! Ah, look!
Oh!

52:14.565 --> 52:15.597
They're in here!

52:15.631 --> 52:17.096
They're all in here!

52:17.131 --> 52:20.064
Ah! Oh, no!

52:20.098 --> 52:21.727
Let's go this way.

52:25.262 --> 52:27.127
Oh, no!

52:28.962 --> 52:30.561
C-Come on.

52:30.595 --> 52:32.426
Yes.

52:33.560 --> 52:34.859
Too many of 'em!

52:34.893 --> 52:35.991
We gotta get
out of here!

52:41.521 --> 52:42.818
Jack, watch it!

52:42.853 --> 52:43.849
Watch out!

52:43.883 --> 52:45.682
Watch out! No!

52:46.215 --> 52:47.354
Jack!

52:54.507 --> 52:57.185
You got this.
Come on!

53:14.757 --> 53:15.954
Let's get
out of here.

53:15.989 --> 53:17.885
Get out of here!

53:18.420 --> 53:20.037
Though that door.

53:35.572 --> 53:38.567
Could there be a prehistoric
link to these spiders?

53:38.602 --> 53:40.365
That's what's trending
on social media

53:40.399 --> 53:41.830
after scientific reports

53:41.864 --> 53:44.328
date these arachnids
back to the Jurassic era.

53:44.362 --> 53:46.559
Meanwhile, mid-Wilshire
is the latest hot spot,

53:46.594 --> 53:48.225
where the famed
La Brea Tar Pits

53:48.260 --> 53:51.057
have been decimated
by dozens of lavalantulas.

53:51.091 --> 53:53.720
And at the center of it all,
action hero Colton West.

53:53.754 --> 53:55.551
Colton?
Eyewitnesses say he saved

53:55.586 --> 53:57.849
dozens of people
on Hollywood Boulevard.

53:59.914 --> 54:01.646
Doc, you okay?

54:01.680 --> 54:02.844
You okay?
You hurt?

54:02.879 --> 54:04.009
What?
Are you hurt?

54:04.044 --> 54:05.242
Are you
bleeding anywhere?

54:05.276 --> 54:06.474
I can't hear you!

54:06.509 --> 54:07.673
I think I lost my hearing.

54:07.707 --> 54:08.673
No, you didn't.
Huh?

54:08.707 --> 54:10.703
It's a helicopter!

54:13.769 --> 54:15.999
Looks like
you're wrapped, kid.

54:16.032 --> 54:17.997
You're going
back to Des Moines.

54:18.032 --> 54:19.361
You're not coming with us?

54:19.396 --> 54:20.828
No. I gotta find my kid.

54:20.863 --> 54:22.359
I hope you find him.
Yeah.

54:22.394 --> 54:24.292
I better, or my wife
will kill me.

54:24.326 --> 54:25.658
You saved my life.

54:25.691 --> 54:28.721
No. No, no.
We saved each other.

54:33.319 --> 54:34.348
Kid.
Huh?

54:34.383 --> 54:35.348
You can let go.
No, no, no.

54:35.383 --> 54:36.346
Let go of me.

54:36.381 --> 54:37.844
No. No, no, no.

54:37.878 --> 54:39.046
Okay.
Okay.

54:39.080 --> 54:40.144
Go.
Sorry.

54:40.176 --> 54:41.276
Movie talk.
Movie talk.

54:41.310 --> 54:43.108
Movie talk.

54:43.142 --> 54:45.006
You're crazy for staying.

54:45.040 --> 54:46.671
Yeah, of course
I'm crazy. I'm an actor.

54:46.705 --> 54:48.102
Good point.

54:48.136 --> 54:50.534
I printed out a thermal map
of Los Angeles.

54:50.568 --> 54:52.798
The orange bits
are the lava tubes.

54:52.833 --> 54:54.763
Stay away from them
if you can.

54:54.797 --> 54:55.762
Thanks, Doc.

54:55.796 --> 54:56.828
Be safe.

54:56.862 --> 54:58.292
Be safe.

55:12.782 --> 55:14.476
Okay. Okay.

55:16.844 --> 55:19.307
Come on. Come on. Okay.

55:27.034 --> 55:27.999
Okay. Okay.

55:29.599 --> 55:31.331
You want some of this?

55:31.364 --> 55:33.927
Yeah, come on! Come on!

55:33.963 --> 55:35.893
It's Christmas.
I got something for you,

55:35.926 --> 55:38.389
a little present
for you. Come on, guys.

55:38.424 --> 55:39.755
Come on.

55:39.790 --> 55:41.285
Colton!

55:41.320 --> 55:42.320
Get in!

55:42.354 --> 55:43.485
Ah, honey.

55:46.615 --> 55:48.080
Come on.
Drive straight.

55:48.114 --> 55:49.279
Drive straight.

55:52.445 --> 55:53.741
Okay.

55:57.840 --> 55:59.769
Ahh!

56:03.468 --> 56:05.597
What were you doing
at the Tar Pits?

56:05.631 --> 56:07.298
Trying to find our son.

56:07.332 --> 56:08.794
I got stuck.

56:08.829 --> 56:10.294
Stuck?

56:10.328 --> 56:12.058
Who gets stuck
at the Tar Pits?

56:12.092 --> 56:13.559
I mean, Wilshire
Boulevard, really?

56:13.593 --> 56:15.023
Everyone knows you
take Olympic downtown.

56:15.057 --> 56:16.787
Thanks, honey.

56:16.822 --> 56:18.386
You okay?

56:18.420 --> 56:20.117
Yeah. I'm okay,

56:20.151 --> 56:22.582
'cause I'm seeing you.

56:22.616 --> 56:24.247
How'd you find me?

56:24.282 --> 56:26.844
After 15 years of
putting out your fires,

56:26.878 --> 56:28.444
I'm gonna just
follow the smoke.

56:28.478 --> 56:30.608
Really?
No.

56:30.643 --> 56:32.175
You're all over
the news.

56:32.209 --> 56:35.070
Ah. So I got
a text from Wyatt.

56:35.105 --> 56:36.269
He's okay.
You did?

56:36.303 --> 56:37.536
Yeah.

56:37.570 --> 56:39.535
He's at Hanson Street
Studios.

56:39.570 --> 56:41.597
Hanson Street.
Yeah.

56:41.632 --> 56:43.097
Pretty ironic, huh?
Yeah.

56:43.131 --> 56:44.395
That's where
we first met.

56:44.430 --> 56:46.493
Heh.

56:46.528 --> 56:47.925
You remember?

56:47.959 --> 56:50.988
Oh, honey, yeah,
of course I remember.

56:51.022 --> 56:52.222
Really?
Yes.

56:52.257 --> 56:55.320
That's so romantic.

56:55.355 --> 56:57.152
I love you, honey.

56:57.185 --> 56:59.082
I love you, too.

56:59.116 --> 57:01.213
Let's get downtown.
We'll get Wyatt,

57:01.248 --> 57:03.577
get the hell out
of this city before it goes.

57:05.678 --> 57:06.809
Mayday! Mayday!

57:06.843 --> 57:09.172
This is Evac 670,
Colton West.

57:09.206 --> 57:11.505
We need help.
This is an emergency.

57:11.539 --> 57:13.202
Mayday! Mayday!
Please come in.

57:14.768 --> 57:16.200
Listen. Listen. They're
saying something.

57:16.236 --> 57:18.029
The authorities are overwhelmed

57:18.064 --> 57:20.029
trying to battle these spiders
and evacuate citizens.

57:20.064 --> 57:22.462
We keep getting new reports
of lavalantulas

57:22.497 --> 57:24.859
erupting from beneath
the ground, spewing fire,

57:24.893 --> 57:27.689
and wreaking havoc
all over the Los Angeles basin.

57:27.723 --> 57:29.721
Nowhere seems to be safe.

57:29.755 --> 57:31.318
Evacuation efforts
have been halted,

57:31.352 --> 57:33.783
and everyone is advised
to stay in place...

57:33.817 --> 57:34.851
I've heard enough.

57:53.799 --> 57:54.964
Come on.

57:58.327 --> 58:00.193
Here... Here I come, son!

58:02.026 --> 58:04.323
Stay away from my kid!

58:04.358 --> 58:07.686
Olivia! Get down, honey!

58:07.721 --> 58:09.150
Mom! Dad!

58:09.185 --> 58:10.417
Wyatt, get down!

58:10.452 --> 58:12.281
Get down!
Wyatt! Get down!

58:12.315 --> 58:14.047
Get down!

58:16.847 --> 58:17.665
Oh, my God.

58:17.700 --> 58:19.432
Are you okay?
Are you okay?

58:20.776 --> 58:21.739
Honey. Honey.

58:21.774 --> 58:23.070
Dad!
Ho ho. My boy.

58:23.104 --> 58:24.202
Mom!

58:24.237 --> 58:26.365
Oh, thank God.

58:30.226 --> 58:31.624
Why do you have
a military truck?

58:31.657 --> 58:33.187
You know your mom.

58:33.221 --> 58:34.518
She likes
everything big.

58:34.552 --> 58:35.650
Yes, I do.

58:35.684 --> 58:37.547
You okay?
Are you all right?

58:37.582 --> 58:39.178
Did you check yourself?
Are you bleeding anywhere?

58:39.213 --> 58:40.175
No, I'm good.
I'm good.

58:40.210 --> 58:41.473
What about
the others?

58:41.508 --> 58:42.473
Are they okay?

58:42.507 --> 58:43.970
They didn't make it.

58:44.005 --> 58:45.037
What?

58:45.071 --> 58:48.164
I know. I know.

58:48.198 --> 58:50.525
How on Earth
did you stay alive?

58:51.958 --> 58:54.418
This.

58:54.453 --> 58:56.183
It's 'cause I sprayed them
with this, and they hate it.

58:56.217 --> 58:57.183
Just a fire
extinguisher?

58:57.217 --> 58:58.912
No, honey. This is...

58:58.946 --> 59:00.442
compressed nitrogen.

59:00.477 --> 59:02.072
Y-You have more of these?

59:02.107 --> 59:03.305
That's the last one.

59:04.869 --> 59:06.099
Nitrogen.

59:06.134 --> 59:07.166
What?

59:07.200 --> 59:08.164
There's shops around here.

59:08.198 --> 59:09.927
Shop?
You want to shop?

59:09.961 --> 59:12.090
No, honey, this nitrogen,

59:12.124 --> 59:15.818
this is what almost killed me
this morning on the set.

59:15.852 --> 59:17.414
This is
gonna keep us alive.

59:17.449 --> 59:19.578
We gotta get out of
here. We really gotta go.

59:19.613 --> 59:22.106
Yeah, and even if we do, these
spiders aren't just gonna let us leave.

59:22.141 --> 59:25.467
Dad, we're gonna
have to fight.

59:26.934 --> 59:29.430
And that's what
we're gonna do, son.

59:33.403 --> 59:34.332
Come on!

59:41.289 --> 59:42.923
Ladies and Gentlemen,

59:42.956 --> 59:45.923
just moments ago, the President
of the United States

59:45.957 --> 59:49.024
declared the L.A. basin
a disaster zone.

59:49.058 --> 59:52.426
I can tell you the situation
has gone from bad to worse.

59:52.460 --> 59:56.029
The Santa Monica Mountains
continue to destabilize.

59:56.062 --> 59:58.128
We're showing you
live footage from Malibu,

59:58.162 --> 59:59.961
where the latest eruption
has occurred.

59:59.995 --> 01:00:03.129
Several freeways
have been severely damaged,

01:00:03.163 --> 01:00:06.798
leading authorities to advise
everyone to stay in place.

01:00:06.833 --> 01:00:10.764
This map shows the damage
spread across the L.A. basin,

01:00:10.799 --> 01:00:13.000
but in the midst
of all this chaos,

01:00:13.035 --> 01:00:14.799
there are selfless acts
of heroism

01:00:14.833 --> 01:00:16.801
as reported
by our own Lisa Miller.

01:00:16.836 --> 01:00:18.866
Uh, yeah. I just wanna say

01:00:18.900 --> 01:00:21.334
that I wouldn't be standing here
if it wasn't for Colton West.

01:00:21.368 --> 01:00:23.036
He's a real-life
action hero.

01:00:23.070 --> 01:00:24.802
Well, I'm sure
he had some help.

01:00:24.837 --> 01:00:26.603
Did you know he
used to be an actor?

01:00:26.637 --> 01:00:28.271
Colton West,
he save my life.

01:00:28.305 --> 01:00:29.971
You super action.

01:00:30.005 --> 01:00:31.469
Well, there you have it.

01:00:31.504 --> 01:00:33.373
In the stranger
than fiction category,

01:00:33.408 --> 01:00:35.371
and in the midst of
the biggest catastrophe

01:00:35.407 --> 01:00:37.040
this city
has ever seen,

01:00:37.074 --> 01:00:39.341
a motion-picture
action hero

01:00:39.375 --> 01:00:42.807
might very well be a
real, live action hero.

01:00:42.842 --> 01:00:43.810
Back to you.

01:00:43.844 --> 01:00:44.809
Thank you, Lisa.

01:00:44.844 --> 01:00:45.876
Has he lost his mind?

01:00:47.142 --> 01:00:48.810
Who the hell's
calling here?

01:00:48.845 --> 01:00:51.477
If it's a spider,
don't answer it.

01:00:51.512 --> 01:00:53.644
Who is it?

01:00:53.678 --> 01:00:55.811
It's Colton West.

01:00:55.847 --> 01:00:57.013
What?
What?!

01:00:58.547 --> 01:01:01.181
Wyatt, Olivia, get
in here. Come in here.

01:01:01.216 --> 01:01:04.116
Oh, Colton.
Colton West, man,

01:01:04.151 --> 01:01:06.280
you are all
over the news.

01:01:06.315 --> 01:01:08.348
Teddy, what are you
still doing here?

01:01:08.382 --> 01:01:10.717
We left the set
same time you did.

01:01:10.750 --> 01:01:12.151
Then all hell
broke loose.

01:01:12.185 --> 01:01:13.784
Freeways
are shut down,

01:01:13.819 --> 01:01:15.652
and those spiders are
killing anything that moves.

01:01:15.687 --> 01:01:18.153
I know. There's no getting
in and out of L.A. now.

01:01:18.187 --> 01:01:20.055
Well, our boys over
at the studio wings

01:01:20.089 --> 01:01:22.221
said that they have
some helicopters.

01:01:22.255 --> 01:01:23.820
They were supposed
to be on their way,

01:01:23.855 --> 01:01:25.622
but they didn't show up,

01:01:25.657 --> 01:01:27.890
and we haven't been able
to get ahold of them since.

01:01:27.924 --> 01:01:29.790
Bigger question is,
what are you doing here?

01:01:29.824 --> 01:01:32.290
I got a plan.
Heh heh.

01:01:32.325 --> 01:01:34.792
You've always got
a plan, Colton West.

01:01:34.826 --> 01:01:36.725
Is this the original
Red Rocket?

01:01:36.759 --> 01:01:38.160
Hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey, hey.

01:01:38.193 --> 01:01:40.560
NASA made
that suit.

01:01:40.595 --> 01:01:45.294
Ah, the days of the
big budgets. Mm, mm, mm.

01:01:45.328 --> 01:01:48.829
Son, this suit, this helmet,
it paid for our house,

01:01:48.865 --> 01:01:51.195
paid for the clothes
you're wearing, your education.

01:01:51.230 --> 01:01:55.297
Paid for everything.

01:01:55.332 --> 01:01:57.131
So why do you
still keep 'em?

01:01:57.166 --> 01:02:00.299
Well... Because I'm
a sucker for nostalgia.

01:02:00.334 --> 01:02:01.333
Yeah.

01:02:01.367 --> 01:02:03.533
How you doing,
young man?

01:02:03.567 --> 01:02:06.034
I always thought one day
we'd make a sequel.

01:02:06.069 --> 01:02:08.968
Well, if things ever get
normal, maybe he'll fly again.

01:02:09.002 --> 01:02:10.669
I wish we could all
fly away from here.

01:02:10.704 --> 01:02:13.872
We're gonna make a break
for it, Colt. You with us?

01:02:13.905 --> 01:02:15.238
No. You're not
going out there.

01:02:15.272 --> 01:02:16.838
I wouldn't count
on the military.

01:02:16.873 --> 01:02:18.572
They're sending in
a ground evac,

01:02:18.606 --> 01:02:20.471
but who knows when
that's gonna happen?

01:02:20.507 --> 01:02:22.074
So we're all
just sitting ducks?

01:02:22.108 --> 01:02:24.538
No, Ted,
I'm not a sitting duck,

01:02:24.572 --> 01:02:26.575
and neither are you.
We're not giving up.

01:02:26.610 --> 01:02:29.643
I love your attitude,
baby, but the fact is...

01:02:29.677 --> 01:02:31.376
Marty, I've been
in this town for 30 years.

01:02:31.410 --> 01:02:33.544
It has not killed me.
It's not gonna kill me now.

01:02:33.577 --> 01:02:36.711
Now, Wyatt said
this kept him alive.

01:02:36.745 --> 01:02:39.479
Nitrogen. You used it on
the set today, weren't you?

01:02:39.512 --> 01:02:42.146
You used this on them?

01:02:42.181 --> 01:02:43.847
Yeah.
It worked?

01:02:43.882 --> 01:02:45.179
Son of a gun.

01:02:45.213 --> 01:02:46.579
Do you have
any more?

01:02:46.614 --> 01:02:48.916
How much
are we talking?

01:02:48.950 --> 01:02:50.582
And what do you have
in mind, Colt?

01:02:50.617 --> 01:02:53.451
I need a map of downtown.

01:02:56.186 --> 01:02:58.719
All right.
This is their nest.

01:02:58.753 --> 01:03:00.217
This is how
they get around.

01:03:00.252 --> 01:03:02.317
This is where
they come out.

01:03:02.352 --> 01:03:04.253
It's all over L.A.

01:03:04.287 --> 01:03:07.219
Right here,
this large chamber,

01:03:07.255 --> 01:03:10.387
that's where
the queen is.

01:03:11.922 --> 01:03:13.689
Okay.

01:03:13.724 --> 01:03:15.755
If this map is accurate...
and it is...

01:03:15.789 --> 01:03:17.322
that's no more than
just a few blocks away.

01:03:17.357 --> 01:03:18.557
That's right.

01:03:18.591 --> 01:03:21.027
Those canisters
of liquid nitrogen,

01:03:21.061 --> 01:03:25.859
we need to wrap bombs
around them. Can you do that?

01:03:25.894 --> 01:03:28.559
I still have a few dozen
sticks of C-4 around.

01:03:28.593 --> 01:03:30.526
I don't see that
as a problem.

01:03:30.561 --> 01:03:34.061
And we could detonate
them by remote.

01:03:34.096 --> 01:03:35.664
Can you do that?

01:03:35.697 --> 01:03:37.731
Not a problem.

01:03:37.764 --> 01:03:39.663
If we make enough
of these canisters

01:03:39.697 --> 01:03:43.398
and drop them down
in the open craters,

01:03:43.432 --> 01:03:45.400
then we can
detonate them,

01:03:45.434 --> 01:03:49.565
and we can smoke this
queen right out of the nest.

01:03:49.599 --> 01:03:51.102
Can you do that?

01:03:51.136 --> 01:03:53.434
Not a problem.
Not a problem.

01:03:53.469 --> 01:03:56.434
I... I don't know much
about this sort of thing,

01:03:56.469 --> 01:03:58.204
but this queen,

01:03:58.238 --> 01:04:00.203
she's gonna be a lot bigger
than the others, right?

01:04:00.237 --> 01:04:01.871
Yeah,
she's gonna be huge.

01:04:01.906 --> 01:04:04.038
And really pissed.

01:04:04.072 --> 01:04:06.273
So, what,
we kill the queen?

01:04:06.306 --> 01:04:08.241
Where does that
even get us?

01:04:08.276 --> 01:04:09.939
Oh, no, no.
What... What he's saying,

01:04:09.973 --> 01:04:11.607
it's... it's
a hive mentality.

01:04:11.642 --> 01:04:14.042
You see, um,
if you kill the queen,

01:04:14.076 --> 01:04:15.773
you kill them all.

01:04:15.807 --> 01:04:17.944
It's... It's like
on the Insect Channel.

01:04:17.978 --> 01:04:19.376
That's right.

01:04:19.410 --> 01:04:22.342
I hate bugs.

01:04:22.377 --> 01:04:24.613
Let's kill the bitch.

01:04:36.117 --> 01:04:37.849
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:04:37.882 --> 01:04:40.449
tonight I call upon you,

01:04:40.484 --> 01:04:43.218
the good people
of the motion picture industry.

01:04:43.252 --> 01:04:46.617
It is you who works tirelessly

01:04:46.653 --> 01:04:51.020
12, 14, 16 hours a day...

01:04:51.054 --> 01:04:54.553
giving pints and pints of
your blood for our great nation.

01:04:54.588 --> 01:04:58.221
Yes, some might say
it's just entertainment,

01:04:58.255 --> 01:04:59.956
but we know better.

01:04:59.991 --> 01:05:01.888
Our movies are where
the hopes and dreams

01:05:01.923 --> 01:05:04.224
of this great nation are born.

01:05:04.258 --> 01:05:07.624
Ladies and gentlemen,
I'm chagrined to say

01:05:07.659 --> 01:05:10.126
that tonight might be
our last production,

01:05:10.160 --> 01:05:12.627
but I beseech you,
please think another way.

01:05:12.662 --> 01:05:15.761
Tonight is our opening night.

01:05:15.795 --> 01:05:18.360
Tonight is the night
that we save our city,

01:05:18.395 --> 01:05:21.763
our homes, our families,

01:05:21.797 --> 01:05:24.062
that we believe in a tomorrow,

01:05:24.097 --> 01:05:26.630
a tomorrow where the Lakers
have another threepeat.

01:05:26.665 --> 01:05:27.899
What about
the Clippers?

01:05:27.934 --> 01:05:29.697
Clippers, too.

01:05:29.732 --> 01:05:34.266
A tomorrow where the Kings
sip again from the Stanley Cup.

01:05:34.300 --> 01:05:35.868
What about
the Ducks?

01:05:35.902 --> 01:05:37.634
The Ducks, too.

01:05:37.669 --> 01:05:39.036
And a tomorrow
where the Dodgers,

01:05:39.070 --> 01:05:42.937
only the Dodgers,
win the World Series.

01:05:42.970 --> 01:05:44.938
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:05:44.972 --> 01:05:48.404
tonight I ask you
to unify as a city,

01:05:48.438 --> 01:05:50.739
above the line, below the line.

01:05:50.774 --> 01:05:53.071
Tonight we draw the line.

01:05:53.105 --> 01:05:54.539
This is your city.

01:05:54.573 --> 01:05:55.573
This is my city.

01:05:55.608 --> 01:05:57.106
I was born in this city.

01:05:57.141 --> 01:05:59.806
I'm gonna die in this city,
but not tonight!

01:05:59.841 --> 01:06:02.311
Viva Los Angelenos!

01:06:04.574 --> 01:06:06.108
Viva Los Angelenos!

01:06:06.144 --> 01:06:09.377
Yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, baby!

01:06:09.412 --> 01:06:11.477
Yeah, that's what I'm
talking about, man!

01:06:13.579 --> 01:06:15.480
Whoo! Whoo!

01:06:18.716 --> 01:06:20.179
Al i run it off.
Okay.

01:06:20.213 --> 01:06:21.414
All right.
I got this.

01:06:21.449 --> 01:06:22.948
Colt. Colt.
Yeah, Marty.

01:06:22.982 --> 01:06:24.149
Yeah.
Listen.

01:06:24.183 --> 01:06:25.515
I've been thinking
about this.

01:06:25.549 --> 01:06:27.149
Mm-hmm. Yeah?
The queen.

01:06:27.184 --> 01:06:29.417
You've gotta get
really close to take her out,

01:06:29.451 --> 01:06:32.084
and bullets
aren't gonna do it.

01:06:32.117 --> 01:06:33.685
You need an explosion,

01:06:33.719 --> 01:06:35.850
and you know what happens
if she explodes?

01:06:35.886 --> 01:06:37.785
It's a death wish
for anyone nearby.

01:06:37.819 --> 01:06:39.754
Okay. So let's
use a remote.

01:06:39.790 --> 01:06:41.821
It's moving,
and it's very hot.

01:06:41.855 --> 01:06:43.454
Who's gonna
slap it on, anyway?

01:06:43.488 --> 01:06:45.021
And besides, remember,
this is C-4.

01:06:45.056 --> 01:06:46.956
That stuff's
gonna go off by itself,

01:06:46.990 --> 01:06:48.822
like it or not.
So how long?

01:06:48.856 --> 01:06:52.359
10, 20 seconds tops.

01:06:52.393 --> 01:06:54.157
Look, man, that was
a really good speech,

01:06:54.191 --> 01:06:56.625
but, um... oh, oh,
okay, great speech,

01:06:56.659 --> 01:06:58.992
but we're gonna need
more than speeches.

01:06:59.026 --> 01:07:02.128
Just make sure
those bombs go off.

01:07:02.163 --> 01:07:04.129
Oh, we will.

01:07:08.863 --> 01:07:12.530
You both just stay here,
and you'll be safe, okay?

01:07:12.564 --> 01:07:14.631
Okay.
And, Wyatt,

01:07:14.665 --> 01:07:16.600
I'm counting
on you, okay?

01:07:16.635 --> 01:07:18.265
Okay.
You be a good boy.

01:07:18.298 --> 01:07:19.266
I will.

01:07:19.300 --> 01:07:20.999
You watch your mother.

01:07:21.033 --> 01:07:22.500
All right.

01:07:22.536 --> 01:07:24.468
Promise me
you'll come back.

01:07:24.502 --> 01:07:25.801
I promise.

01:07:25.835 --> 01:07:28.436
Okay.

01:07:28.470 --> 01:07:30.735
Don't worry.

01:07:34.205 --> 01:07:35.770
And how 'bout you?

01:07:35.804 --> 01:07:38.006
You want to go to a Dodger
game when I come back?

01:07:38.040 --> 01:07:39.271
Yeah.

01:07:39.306 --> 01:07:40.973
Hate to interrupt
a family moment,

01:07:41.008 --> 01:07:42.874
but it's go time.

01:07:42.909 --> 01:07:44.840
Okay.
Okay.

01:07:44.874 --> 01:07:45.874
All right.

01:07:48.343 --> 01:07:49.676
I love you.

01:07:51.076 --> 01:07:52.643
It's gonna be okay.

01:08:04.548 --> 01:08:07.181
This is alpha. We are
nearing the first drop.

01:08:12.983 --> 01:08:14.951
The first bomb is away.

01:08:20.852 --> 01:08:22.618
Roger that.
This is Bravo team.

01:08:22.654 --> 01:08:24.353
We're nearing
the second crater.

01:08:31.924 --> 01:08:33.688
Two is away.
Repeat, two is away.

01:08:33.723 --> 01:08:35.323
We'll show them,
stupid spider,

01:08:35.359 --> 01:08:37.858
good kung fu
fighting technique.

01:08:37.892 --> 01:08:40.491
It is eerily quiet
on the streets of Los Angeles

01:08:40.524 --> 01:08:43.126
as the greater
metro area smolders

01:08:43.160 --> 01:08:45.524
under the crippling
volcanic eruptions

01:08:45.560 --> 01:08:47.892
and the onslaught
of lavalantulas

01:08:47.926 --> 01:08:49.895
that have been thrust up
from their nest,

01:08:49.930 --> 01:08:51.828
decimating everything
in their path.

01:08:51.862 --> 01:08:53.997
Now the residents
that were evacuated earlier

01:08:54.031 --> 01:08:56.328
are long gone,
hopefully to safety.

01:08:56.365 --> 01:09:00.296
Those who remain are
hunkered down under martial law.

01:09:00.331 --> 01:09:02.465
Let me tell you,
even though this small area

01:09:02.499 --> 01:09:04.067
might seem safe for now,

01:09:04.100 --> 01:09:07.334
no one inside the city
and the ring of fire are safe.

01:09:07.368 --> 01:09:10.002
Rescue efforts are
still being hindered,

01:09:10.036 --> 01:09:11.734
so all of these brave residents,

01:09:11.769 --> 01:09:14.836
all they can do is
sit and wait and pray.

01:09:17.868 --> 01:09:19.837
Keep it moving.
Keep it moving.

01:09:30.675 --> 01:09:32.506
Hey, man, I'm gonna
need some backup.

01:09:32.541 --> 01:09:34.376
There's lots
of spiders here.

01:09:34.410 --> 01:09:36.809
Don't worry, Teddy.
Cavalry's on its way.

01:09:45.344 --> 01:09:47.645
All right, now.

01:09:47.680 --> 01:09:49.348
I'm here. Come on!

01:09:49.381 --> 01:09:51.580
Come on! Come on!

01:09:51.613 --> 01:09:54.714
I got something
for you and your mama!

01:09:54.748 --> 01:09:57.515
Take that! Come on!

01:10:00.916 --> 01:10:03.384
Ah! Ah!

01:10:05.551 --> 01:10:06.650
I need some help here.

01:10:06.685 --> 01:10:08.754
I need some help!

01:10:08.788 --> 01:10:10.386
Full power.

01:10:14.756 --> 01:10:16.888
Oh.

01:10:16.921 --> 01:10:18.122
Oh.

01:10:20.124 --> 01:10:21.722
Hoo.

01:10:25.693 --> 01:10:26.859
Move it! Move it!
Oh, guys...

01:10:28.025 --> 01:10:29.558
Come on,
come on, come on!

01:10:29.593 --> 01:10:30.590
Teddy.
Come on!

01:10:32.762 --> 01:10:33.794
Come on.

01:10:35.228 --> 01:10:37.462
Come on,
you suckers.

01:10:39.362 --> 01:10:41.430
Come on.
Come on. Come on.

01:10:50.200 --> 01:10:51.866
What?
They're gone.

01:10:51.900 --> 01:10:53.732
Well, it worked,
didn't it?

01:10:53.767 --> 01:10:55.366
Yeah.

01:10:55.401 --> 01:10:57.068
Okay.
What's the plan, Colt?

01:10:57.101 --> 01:10:58.668
Uh, you know
how we always say

01:10:58.703 --> 01:11:01.035
that making a film
is like war?

01:11:01.069 --> 01:11:02.736
Yeah.
Yeah.

01:11:02.771 --> 01:11:05.368
Well, let's hope that this war
is like making a film.

01:11:05.403 --> 01:11:06.705
What does that mean?

01:11:06.738 --> 01:11:07.837
Means I need you
to plant those bombs.

01:11:07.872 --> 01:11:09.338
Okay, but what
does that mean?

01:11:09.373 --> 01:11:10.938
Means I need you
to plant those bombs.

01:11:10.973 --> 01:11:13.071
Where are you going? What
are you doing? Colton!

01:11:13.105 --> 01:11:16.273
Colt! Come back here, Colt.44!
Come back here!

01:11:16.307 --> 01:11:18.874
Uh, your attention please.
Colton has gone rogue.

01:11:18.909 --> 01:11:21.575
Everybody keep going.
The plan remains the same.

01:11:21.609 --> 01:11:23.709
Repeat, it remains
the same, all right? Out.

01:11:23.743 --> 01:11:25.275
What is he doing?

01:11:25.309 --> 01:11:27.610
He's just being your
father. I don't...

01:11:27.645 --> 01:11:30.378
Keep moving, laddies.
We've got to win this one.

01:11:30.412 --> 01:11:32.110
Freedom!

01:12:27.664 --> 01:12:28.664
Damn it!

01:12:51.504 --> 01:12:54.738
Marty. Marty.
Come in, Marty.

01:12:54.772 --> 01:12:56.539
There you are, man.

01:12:56.572 --> 01:12:58.939
Hey, where are you?
Exactly where are you?

01:12:58.973 --> 01:13:01.974
You'll know in a little bit.

01:13:02.009 --> 01:13:03.239
What's our status?

01:13:03.274 --> 01:13:04.939
You got
those bombs planted?

01:13:04.973 --> 01:13:05.974
Red 3 standing by.

01:13:06.009 --> 01:13:07.542
Red 2 standing by.

01:13:07.576 --> 01:13:09.106
Red 5 standing by.

01:13:09.141 --> 01:13:10.775
R2, shut up.
I'm busy, man.

01:13:10.810 --> 01:13:12.209
Standing by, man.
Great.

01:13:12.244 --> 01:13:14.142
I'm counting on you,
Marty.

01:13:14.177 --> 01:13:16.610
I'm counting on you.

01:13:16.645 --> 01:13:18.080
We gonna be
all right, Colt.

01:13:18.113 --> 01:13:19.979
You just make sure
you don't get dead.

01:13:34.651 --> 01:13:37.385
Colt, I really hope
you're there,

01:13:37.419 --> 01:13:39.486
'cause if you've got a plan,
now's the time.

01:13:39.519 --> 01:13:41.385
Yeah, I got a plan.

01:13:41.419 --> 01:13:42.486
It's go time.

01:13:42.519 --> 01:13:44.754
Go time?
Go where time?

01:13:44.787 --> 01:13:46.154
What... Where are you?

01:13:46.189 --> 01:13:48.787
I found a little party
I want to drop in on.

01:14:00.026 --> 01:14:01.425
Make some music, Teddy.

01:14:01.461 --> 01:14:05.227
On my mark,
3, 2, 1.

01:14:05.261 --> 01:14:06.694
We're rolling.

01:14:21.033 --> 01:14:22.633
Oh.

01:14:24.666 --> 01:14:26.233
One didn't go off.

01:14:26.267 --> 01:14:27.434
Push it again.

01:14:27.468 --> 01:14:28.436
I'm pushing it.

01:14:30.303 --> 01:14:31.268
Oh, my gosh.

01:14:31.303 --> 01:14:34.336
Oh, my...

01:14:35.837 --> 01:14:37.170
Load up.
Load up.

01:14:37.205 --> 01:14:40.337
Yah!
- What the...

01:14:40.371 --> 01:14:41.435
Yah!

01:14:41.471 --> 01:14:43.006
Incoming!

01:14:43.041 --> 01:14:45.107
Incoming!
Let's go! Go! Go! Go!

01:14:45.141 --> 01:14:46.240
Go!
Take 'em out!

01:14:47.708 --> 01:14:49.642
Over there.
Tighten the flank!

01:14:49.678 --> 01:14:51.574
Tighten the flank!
Don't let 'em through!

01:14:51.608 --> 01:14:53.110
Hold 'em!

01:14:53.143 --> 01:14:54.475
Back up. Back up!
Hold the line.

01:14:54.509 --> 01:14:57.241
Come on.
Hold the line!

01:14:57.275 --> 01:14:59.111
Watch your flank!
Watch your flank, guys!

01:14:59.144 --> 01:15:01.010
Tighten it up!
Tighten it up!

01:15:01.045 --> 01:15:02.878
That's it! Spray 'em!

01:15:11.849 --> 01:15:14.080
Ah...

01:15:14.115 --> 01:15:16.984
What we gonna do?
How am I gonna spray that, man?

01:15:17.018 --> 01:15:18.248
She's bigger than
the damn buildings.

01:15:18.282 --> 01:15:20.382
Mama's home.

01:15:22.884 --> 01:15:27.453
If anybody's got a Plan B,
uh, how 'bout now?

01:15:32.821 --> 01:15:36.287
She's not just bad.
She's big.

01:15:36.322 --> 01:15:37.523
Really big.

01:15:41.958 --> 01:15:43.091
C-4 now.

01:15:43.126 --> 01:15:45.624
Oh, you're kidding me.
What?

01:15:45.658 --> 01:15:47.192
Where the hell is it?

01:15:47.227 --> 01:15:49.660
I know where it is.

01:15:59.830 --> 01:16:01.630
All right, Colt.

01:16:01.664 --> 01:16:03.029
Action.

01:16:03.065 --> 01:16:04.599
Unbelievable.

01:16:04.633 --> 01:16:06.931
Let's hope this works.

01:16:09.834 --> 01:16:10.833
Whoa!

01:16:13.501 --> 01:16:14.768
Go! Go!
Let's go!

01:16:14.803 --> 01:16:16.604
Go! Go!
Get out of here!

01:16:16.637 --> 01:16:18.069
Run! Run!
Everybody, run!

01:16:24.571 --> 01:16:25.670
No. No, no, no!
No, no, no!

01:16:25.705 --> 01:16:27.439
Whoa! Ow!

01:16:27.473 --> 01:16:29.038
Ow! Ow!

01:16:32.376 --> 01:16:33.973
Steady. Come on, steady.

01:16:34.008 --> 01:16:35.208
Whoa. Ow! Whoa. Whoa, whoa.

01:16:35.242 --> 01:16:37.241
Ow!

01:16:42.877 --> 01:16:44.209
Oh ho. Okay.

01:16:45.911 --> 01:16:48.478
Ooh.

01:16:48.513 --> 01:16:49.679
Aah! Whoo!

01:16:49.714 --> 01:16:51.145
Whoo-hoo-hoo!
That's hot!

01:16:51.180 --> 01:16:52.246
Ow!

01:16:54.415 --> 01:16:56.482
Hi, baby.

01:17:04.483 --> 01:17:06.750
Nice mouth.

01:17:18.587 --> 01:17:20.288
And in breaking news,

01:17:20.322 --> 01:17:22.288
while airlifts
are finally under way,

01:17:22.322 --> 01:17:25.890
evacuating the rest
of the civilians from the area,

01:17:25.924 --> 01:17:29.325
one man and his ragtag team of...
and you're hearing this right...

01:17:29.359 --> 01:17:32.624
film crew actually
devised a successful plan

01:17:32.657 --> 01:17:34.625
to take down
the queen lavalantula

01:17:34.659 --> 01:17:36.659
and send the rest
of these creatures back down

01:17:36.693 --> 01:17:40.160
to their fiery home thousands
of feet below the city.

01:17:40.194 --> 01:17:42.628
That hero is none other
than Colton West,

01:17:42.662 --> 01:17:45.860
who, against all odds,
risked life and limb

01:17:45.895 --> 01:17:47.997
to save this still great city.

01:17:48.030 --> 01:17:50.331
And all that this reporter
can say,

01:17:50.366 --> 01:17:53.965
in the now infamous words
of Colton West, is nice job.

01:18:03.670 --> 01:18:07.234
Oh, hey, buddy.
Come on. Come on.

01:18:07.269 --> 01:18:08.237
Over here.

01:18:08.272 --> 01:18:09.537
Hey, come on. Oh.

01:18:09.570 --> 01:18:11.172
Come on.
Come on. We got you.

01:18:11.206 --> 01:18:12.538
Oh, thank you.
We got you.

01:18:12.572 --> 01:18:13.704
Ho ho ho. Step up.

01:18:13.740 --> 01:18:15.638
You all right?
Yeah.

01:18:15.672 --> 01:18:17.805
You still... Oh, yeah.
Aw, man. Ow!

01:18:17.840 --> 01:18:19.006
Nice suit.
Yeah.

01:18:19.039 --> 01:18:20.908
I'm really glad
you kept it.

01:18:20.942 --> 01:18:22.739
You're welcome.
You're welcome.

01:18:24.010 --> 01:18:25.641
Dad!

01:18:25.675 --> 01:18:27.976
Dad! Dad! Dad!

01:18:28.010 --> 01:18:29.475
I'm fine, my son.

01:18:29.509 --> 01:18:31.310
Dad, I was watching
the news the whole time,

01:18:31.344 --> 01:18:32.843
It was so cool!
My good boy.

01:18:32.877 --> 01:18:33.912
Oh, he's a good boy.

01:18:33.946 --> 01:18:35.812
You are crazy.
Oh, yeah.

01:18:35.847 --> 01:18:37.511
You know that?
Oh, yeah.

01:18:37.546 --> 01:18:39.080
Honey, I really hurt.
I think I broke...

01:18:39.115 --> 01:18:40.811
Come on. Come on.
I think I broke my face.

01:18:40.847 --> 01:18:42.147
Get him out of here.

01:18:42.181 --> 01:18:43.746
Oh, I think... I gotta
go to the hospital.

01:18:43.780 --> 01:18:44.847
But, Dad...
Yeah?

01:18:44.881 --> 01:18:46.083
Dad, you did it.
Yeah. Yeah.

01:18:46.118 --> 01:18:47.216
The West family did it.

01:18:47.250 --> 01:18:48.316
Yeah, we did it.
We all did.

01:18:48.350 --> 01:18:49.882
I think I did
a lot of it,

01:18:49.917 --> 01:18:51.384
but I think
we did it together.

01:18:51.418 --> 01:18:54.250
I smell a sequel
coming on.

01:18:54.285 --> 01:18:56.552
"Red Rocket 2"?

01:18:56.586 --> 01:18:57.885
"Attack
of the Lavalantulas."

01:18:57.921 --> 01:18:58.885
Ah.

01:18:58.920 --> 01:18:59.886
Everybody gets a suit.

01:18:59.921 --> 01:19:01.053
I want a suit.

01:19:01.087 --> 01:19:02.821
Well, you could
put me in mine.

01:19:02.856 --> 01:19:04.053
Ooh, I like that.

01:19:04.087 --> 01:19:05.387
Oh, yeah, baby.

01:19:06.790 --> 01:19:07.754
Yeah. Aw, yeah.

01:19:07.788 --> 01:19:10.088
Aw, yeah, baby.

01:19:10.122 --> 01:19:11.889
â™ª Red Rocket
in the house, yo â™ª

01:19:11.924 --> 01:19:14.154
We thinking about all kinds
of Red Rocket products.

01:19:14.189 --> 01:19:15.386
Yeah.
Red Rocket tacos.

01:19:15.420 --> 01:19:17.218
Red Rocket lipstick.

01:19:17.252 --> 01:19:18.516
Red Rocket lipstick.

01:19:18.551 --> 01:19:20.148
Red Rocket burritos,
Red-ritos.

01:19:20.183 --> 01:19:21.813
Red Rocket shoes.
Ha ha ha ha.

01:19:21.848 --> 01:19:23.078
Red Rocket rockets.

01:19:23.113 --> 01:19:25.816
Red Rocket rockets.
Y-Yeah.

01:19:25.851 --> 01:19:27.555
<i>Colton West has saved Los Angeles.</i>

01:19:27.608 --> 01:19:31.048
<i>Authorities say publicly
not one has been left alive...</i>

01:19:31.971 --> 01:19:33.568
<i>But many wonder aloud</i>

01:19:33.603 --> 01:19:37.235
<i>if this is the last we've
seen of the lavalantulas.</i>
