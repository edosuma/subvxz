Now, come on!
Let's grab a wheelbarrow

08:48.820 --> 08:50.655
so we can haul these inside!

08:50.655 --> 08:51.531
Right behind you, Papa!

08:54.325 --> 08:56.870
Huh. That's odd...

08:56.870 --> 08:59.247
I was sure that pumpkin‐shaped
divot in the ground

08:59.247 --> 09:01.458
used to contain a pumpkin...

09:01.458 --> 09:02.917
Hmm...

09:02.917 --> 09:05.628
There. The pumpkin carving
station looks...

09:05.628 --> 09:07.672
"gourd"‐geous!

09:07.672 --> 09:09.257

I just can't help but feel

09:09.257 --> 09:10.383
like something's off.

Mister Green,
Benny here.

09:19.559 --> 09:21.853
That pumpkin made
a scawy face at me!

09:21.853 --> 09:23.438
Oh, you must be mistaken.

09:23.438 --> 09:25.065
None of these pumpkins
have been carved yet.

Mister, I'm tellin ya!

09:26.775 --> 09:29.319
There's somethin' wrong
with your pumpkins, I say!

09:29.319 --> 09:31.946
Something vewy vewy wrong!

Now, son,

09:33.823 --> 09:35.950
if these pumpkins
are "wrong,"

09:35.950 --> 09:37.368
I don't want to be right.

Tilly and I picked them
ourselves.

‐What?! Oh.

09:40.747 --> 09:42.582
Uh, hey, yep.

something to do...

We can't hear you.
There's hair in your mouth.

11:05.248 --> 11:07.625
I stole a modified alien
substance from BigTech

11:07.625 --> 11:10.128
and secretly used it
to mutate Papa's pumpkins!

11:10.128 --> 11:11.629
But he was just so sad!

the others will, too.

I never said that,
but thank you for your support.

Oh, gosh, dang!
It's a whole pumpkin army!

17:18.412 --> 17:20.039
They're totally pinned down!

17:20.039 --> 17:21.415
All right, you pumpkin heads,

17:21.415 --> 17:23.793
I came to this party
to do two things.

17:23.793 --> 17:26.462
Smash pumpkins
and play tricks.

17:26.462 --> 17:28.631

Relax, Master Remy.
It's all fake.

20:16.507 --> 20:18.300
Ugh. What happened?

20:18.300 --> 20:20.636
Farm stuff.
Don't worry about it.

20:20.636 --> 20:23.222
How... did I get here?

20:23.222 --> 20:24.598
‐[Cricket and Tilly] Dad?
‐Huh?

20:24.598 --> 20:26.183
Kids, you're okay!

20:26.183 --> 20:28.060
Cricket! But how?
I thought that‐‐

20:28.060 --> 20:30.354
My best trick yet.
Fake blood.

20:30.354 --> 20:32.064
The treat is that I'm alive.

20:32.064 --> 20:33.733
Oh, I get it now!

20:33.733 --> 20:36.610
Like "Trick or Treat."
Nice one, <i>Trickor</i> .

20:36.610 --> 20:38.654
[gasps] Yes!

20:38.654 --> 20:40.531
Validation!

20:40.531 --> 20:43.951
Uh, Papa, I'm really
sorry about all this.

20:43.951 --> 20:45.578
Although my Bill Green costume

20:45.578 --> 20:47.455
may have been convincing
on the outside,

20:47.455 --> 20:50.458
my inside was missing
the most important part...

20:50.458 --> 20:52.376
I get it, I have a gut.

20:52.376 --> 20:54.128
No, your <i>other</i> gut.

20:54.128 --> 20:56.422
The one that tells you
right from wrong.

20:56.422 --> 20:58.549
I knew that taking
the compound was wrong,

20:58.549 --> 21:00.509
but I did it anyway.

21:00.509 --> 21:03.763
Look, what you did back there
was really dangerous.

21:03.763 --> 21:06.807
The world almost got taken
over by vegetable overlords!

21:06.807 --> 21:08.100
[cringes]

21:08.100 --> 21:10.728
We all make mistakes.
Some small.

21:10.728 --> 21:13.230
Some... really big.

21:13.230 --> 21:16.484
But what matters is that
you grow from those mistakes.

21:16.484 --> 21:18.068
The good kind of grow.

21:18.068 --> 21:19.695
I love you, Papa.

21:19.695 --> 21:21.030

Everyone, get down!
There's alien vegetables
taking over the city!

‐We took care of it.
‐Oh, you took care of it.

Huh. You want this?

‐[Bill and Tilly] No!
‐Oh, okay.

on Mars lab.

21:43.928 --> 21:45.429
You make one tiny,
alien monster

21:45.429 --> 21:47.556
that's out to destroy
the human species,

21:47.556 --> 21:49.433
and suddenly you're made out
to be the bad guy, I guess!

21:49.433 --> 21:51.519
Well, thanks for taking care
of things down here.

21:51.519 --> 21:52.812

delivering groceries to her?
