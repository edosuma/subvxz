00:13.263 --> 00:15.306
OMG, you're up to 25K followers.

00:15.390 --> 00:18.435
And #ErikasEpicWinterWonderland
is still trending.

00:18.518 --> 00:21.479
It was our party. It should be
#GiakasEpicWinterWonderland.

00:21.563 --> 00:24.107
Nah. You can claim the fame
and the cleanup.

00:24.190 --> 00:25.984
I saved it for you
'cause I'm a good friend.

00:27.902 --> 00:30.905
Damn. Your dead body
might not make it to prom in two weeks.

00:30.989 --> 00:33.825
We should've saved some ice for the body.
It's gonna by a million degrees.

00:35.785 --> 00:38.204
Got it. Okay. House, ice, body.

00:38.288 --> 00:40.498
What was that thing
you wanted to tell me about?

00:40.582 --> 00:42.250
Uh, do you remember Gavin?

00:42.751 --> 00:44.711
Afterlifer who does fake magic?

00:44.794 --> 00:46.588
No, that's Brad. Gavin's a wizard.

00:46.671 --> 00:48.465
Or… a medium. I don't remember.

00:48.548 --> 00:50.925
Anyway, he's the cute one
with the really soulful eyes.

00:51.009 --> 00:53.386
So the other weird one. What about him?

00:55.055 --> 00:56.514
Um, he, uh…

00:57.265 --> 01:00.226
-He really likes your Ambassadors.

01:00.310 --> 01:03.063
And apparently, so did Riley,
before she got publicly dragged.

01:03.146 --> 01:06.441
Now, I would not wanna be her walking
into school this morning.

01:06.524 --> 01:08.651
Oh God. I publicly dragged Riley.

01:08.735 --> 01:10.111
My name is Erika Vu,

01:10.195 --> 01:11.780
and this is my party, bitch.

01:11.863 --> 01:13.531
So, if you don't like it,
there's the door.

01:13.615 --> 01:16.201
Erika! Erika!

01:16.284 --> 01:19.329
-God, she's gonna be so pissed.
-So? That's a good thing.

01:19.412 --> 01:21.664
You're not a somebody
until you have an enemy.

01:21.748 --> 01:24.292
And a parking spot!

01:32.634 --> 01:34.719
Is it just me or is everyone in school
wearing earbuds?

01:34.803 --> 01:36.554
You're trending… in person.

01:36.638 --> 01:37.555
Bitch!

01:38.473 --> 01:40.600
It's Erika Vu, bitch.

01:40.683 --> 01:45.522
Thank you so much for finally giving me
the chance to wear midnight blue. Again.

01:45.605 --> 01:48.024
Regular blue just does not flatter me
the same way.

01:48.983 --> 01:50.026
Oh! Hey!

01:50.110 --> 01:51.111
-Erika. Hi.

01:51.194 --> 01:54.114
Um, can I get your thoughts
on something timely?

01:54.823 --> 01:57.200
-No problem. Can I swing by after school?
-Uh, how about now?

01:57.283 --> 02:00.245
We literally stopped the presses so
you could approve your new yearbook page.

02:01.454 --> 02:04.082
You're a lucky man. She is super cool.

02:04.165 --> 02:05.375
She's dope, isn't she?

02:05.458 --> 02:08.503
It's just nice to finally be
drama-free for once. You know?

02:08.586 --> 02:10.880
Now, what are you talking about?
You love drama.

02:10.964 --> 02:13.216
No, I hate it.
That's why I broke up with Riley.

02:13.299 --> 02:16.302
-Uh, then why are you with Erika?
-Well, Erika's chill.

02:16.845 --> 02:19.889
-Didn't you just say how cool she is?
-Yeah, I said "cool."

02:19.973 --> 02:21.933
Not "chill." There's a difference.

02:22.016 --> 02:24.936
Yeah. "Cool" is like she throws parties.

02:25.019 --> 02:27.939
She sets trends. She breaks vases.

02:28.022 --> 02:31.484
"Chill" is like she doesn't
bring any drama or need attention.

02:31.568 --> 02:32.986
That's totally Erika.

02:33.069 --> 02:35.572
Yeah. No. She seemed chill at first,

02:35.655 --> 02:38.783
but she actually brings more drama
than Riley ever did.

02:38.867 --> 02:39.909
More than Riley?

02:40.493 --> 02:43.580
Oh, come on. Name one dramatic thing
that Erika's ever done.

02:43.663 --> 02:48.042
Well… first, she flirts with you,
and then she ghosts you.

02:48.126 --> 02:52.338
And then she ruins my promposal,
which, BT-dubstep, we all have to redo,

02:52.422 --> 02:54.507
because Lea is neither chill nor cool.

02:54.591 --> 02:58.761
And then she says she doesn't do prom,
then suddenly she does prom.

02:58.845 --> 03:01.890
I mean, she's…
she's the definition of dramarama.

03:01.973 --> 03:05.226
Okay, man, look. I… I messed up
your promposal. That was me. All right?

03:05.310 --> 03:06.686
And Erika, she said no to prom

03:06.769 --> 03:09.105
because she was worried
that I was gonna say no to her.

03:09.189 --> 03:13.610
Okay. Dude, it's like reverse girlology.

03:14.194 --> 03:16.863
You know?
Like reverse psychology, but with girls.

03:16.946 --> 03:18.281
Oh. Yes.

03:18.364 --> 03:19.908
Yeah, man. No, I get it. It's just dumb.

03:20.575 --> 03:21.492
Also,

03:22.327 --> 03:23.912
it was Riley's go-to move.

03:24.454 --> 03:27.749
See, you're a drama addict
who doesn't know he's an addict.

03:27.832 --> 03:30.293
-Mm-mm-mm.
-That's it. That's it right there.

03:32.378 --> 03:35.340
Oh wow. Wait, that was kind of genius.

03:35.423 --> 03:37.300
I've always had
a knack for technology,

03:37.383 --> 03:39.302
but recently I've gotten very good at it.

03:39.802 --> 03:43.556
Hey. Is there any way you could help out
with the senior slideshow?

03:44.140 --> 03:45.266
I'm under a lot of pressure.

03:45.350 --> 03:48.686
It's the biggest senior event
besides prom, and Riley was curating,

03:48.770 --> 03:51.022
and she was supposed to do
her final pass today,

03:51.105 --> 03:52.649
but she didn't show.

03:52.732 --> 03:55.652
Poor thing's probably icing a bruised ego.

03:55.735 --> 03:59.405
-Smackdown was pretty harsh.
-Yeah, but she'll bounce back.

03:59.489 --> 04:02.533
I don't know. Some things
you can't bounce back from. You know?

04:02.617 --> 04:04.702
Like a condom
left out in the sun too long.

04:06.079 --> 04:06.913
Shit.

04:07.872 --> 04:08.831
Shit.

04:08.915 --> 04:11.292
Oh my God! This is such bad karma.

04:11.376 --> 04:12.794
-Hey!

04:12.877 --> 04:15.296
Do you know where I can find
this super fun, really hot girl

04:15.380 --> 04:18.549
who started this, like, rando trend
of wearing earbuds all the time?

04:18.633 --> 04:23.054
-Could it be me?
-Maybe, but… I'm gonna need proof.

04:23.137 --> 04:24.180
Follow me.

04:31.187 --> 04:32.730
-Yep, it's you.

04:32.814 --> 04:35.233
-I had fun last night.
-Me too.

04:35.316 --> 04:38.194
Actually, I think everyone did.
They're all still talking about the party.

04:38.278 --> 04:42.448
Yeah, about that. They're
also talking about how I took down Riley.

04:42.532 --> 04:44.284
Ah, that, yeah.

04:44.367 --> 04:46.869
-But she's the worst, right?
-She's got her problems.

04:46.953 --> 04:49.789
But, if she was the worst,
I wouldn't have dated her for four years.

04:50.373 --> 04:52.292
Know what? How about
we talk about something else?

04:53.293 --> 04:56.004
Totally. Riley is the last thing
I wanna talk about.

04:57.338 --> 04:59.132
But do you think I took it too far?

04:59.215 --> 05:01.384
Is there a way she's gonna spin it
that I'm the bully,

05:01.467 --> 05:02.593
even though she's the bully?

05:03.261 --> 05:04.345
Does it matter?

05:05.346 --> 05:07.765
But, it… it wasn't even that bad, right?

05:07.849 --> 05:10.268
She deserved it.
I definitely had to put her in her place.

05:11.060 --> 05:13.438
Sure, but she's just not
one to stay put for long.

05:14.230 --> 05:15.440
What does that mean?

05:15.523 --> 05:17.984
It means she'll bounce back.
She always does.

05:18.067 --> 05:20.653
Exactly. So I shouldn't feel bad.
I had no choice.

05:20.737 --> 05:22.905
She was screaming at me.
I had to defend myself.

05:22.989 --> 05:25.325
-Totally. Uh, but…
-But what?

05:25.408 --> 05:28.578
If it were me,
I would have done it in private.

05:30.830 --> 05:32.957
-I'll text you after class.
-Wait, wait, wait.

05:33.041 --> 05:34.792
What does that mean? Is she gonna kill me?

05:36.961 --> 05:39.922
Nope. She can't kill me,
'cause I'm already dead.

05:41.174 --> 05:43.051
But she can destroy me. Shit!

05:47.722 --> 05:50.308
So thirsty.

05:54.228 --> 05:55.063
Boo.

06:10.787 --> 06:11.662
Gavin!

06:12.955 --> 06:15.166
So nothing happened
while you were upstairs at the party?

06:15.249 --> 06:16.501
Brad said you disappeared.

06:16.584 --> 06:18.252
-Dude, were you hooking up?
-No.

06:32.642 --> 06:34.352
-You should get that.

06:34.435 --> 06:35.853
Maybe I don't want to.

06:35.937 --> 06:37.480
-Okay, then don't.
-I won't.

06:38.314 --> 06:40.900
-Not because of you. I don't feel like it.
-Okay.

06:40.983 --> 06:44.320
I'm not apologizing for last night.
I didn't do anything you wouldn't have.

06:44.404 --> 06:45.863
Why would I want an apology?

06:45.947 --> 06:47.698
Those are for the mentally weak.

06:49.075 --> 06:50.451
Okay. So you're okay?

06:50.535 --> 06:53.037
Don't be lame
after you finally did something cool.

06:53.121 --> 06:54.330
You outbitched the bitch.

06:55.039 --> 06:57.708
In another lifetime,
maybe we could've been friends.

06:57.792 --> 07:00.294
-Well, we could still be friends.
-Or we could be frenemies.

07:01.629 --> 07:02.964
Do I have a choice?

07:03.798 --> 07:04.966
Frenemies it is.

07:05.550 --> 07:09.137
Um, and since you were late to school,
I took over the slideshow. Is that cool?

07:14.517 --> 07:17.145
Sorry. I… I don't know
what that look means.

07:17.228 --> 07:19.105
It means I don't give a shit.

07:19.188 --> 07:20.731
Can you please just try and give a shit?

07:20.815 --> 07:22.775
I've been blowing up your phone.
Where've you been?

07:22.859 --> 07:24.444
Where have I been? Where have <i>you </i>been?

07:24.527 --> 07:25.903
I needed you, but I'm fine now.

07:25.987 --> 07:29.615
Riley and I came to an understanding,
and she's not gonna shank me. I'm okay.

07:29.699 --> 07:31.993
Well, I am not okay. I am crushed.

07:32.076 --> 07:34.537
I know that you think
Gavin just talks to spirits,

07:34.620 --> 07:36.164
but he also talks to me.

07:36.247 --> 07:39.041
And last night…
we talked with our tongues.

07:39.125 --> 07:42.044
I thought that we really had something.
I thought we were soul mates.

07:42.795 --> 07:46.632
But then… then I saw him outside,
and he, like, totally blew me off.

07:46.716 --> 07:47.842
So what do I do?

07:47.925 --> 07:50.761
YBFOASSADFHIATT.

07:53.598 --> 07:54.724
Oh, sorry. What did you say?

07:54.807 --> 07:57.268
I was listening to Siri
read me a text from Jake C.

07:57.768 --> 08:01.147
What did I say?
I… I just poured my heart out to you.

08:01.981 --> 08:05.067
I'm sorry. Tell me again.
This time I'm really gonna listen.

08:05.151 --> 08:08.154
Okay, yeah. Last night I made out
with Gavin, and now he's blowing me off.

08:08.237 --> 08:10.656
-Oh my God. No fricking way.
-Yeah, right. What a dick.

08:10.740 --> 08:13.284
Or a cooze. @sunsetandkittens47?

08:13.868 --> 08:16.412
-The handle's not gender-specific.
-What are you talking about?

08:16.496 --> 08:18.581
A comment about me on
that really cool TikTok.

08:18.664 --> 08:21.167
Someone wrote, "New name, same bitch.
She'll always be Helen Who."

08:21.667 --> 08:25.129
All right. So you're not gonna hear
anything I say unless it's about you?

08:25.213 --> 08:28.341
I have a hater, okay?
Someone's trolling me on TikTok.

08:28.424 --> 08:29.800
I mean, can I just delete it?

08:31.344 --> 08:33.429
Shit, I can't. It's not on my page.

08:33.513 --> 08:35.389
-Okay, I'll just report it.
-For what?

08:35.473 --> 08:36.891
-Social terrorism.
-Seriously?

08:36.974 --> 08:38.726
You're right. What if it doesn't work?

08:38.809 --> 08:40.811
I have to find who posted it,
tell them take it down.

08:40.895 --> 08:44.482
It's probably Riley, okay? She's trying
to do a bait and switch to throw me off.

08:44.565 --> 08:47.568
But, you know what?
She underestimated me. Again. BRB DM.

08:52.573 --> 08:55.993
So… …Riley finally
gave you guys permission to sit with me.

08:56.077 --> 08:57.745
Uh, she put us on time-out.

08:57.828 --> 09:00.331
We tried to sit with her first,
but she said no.

09:01.541 --> 09:02.708
I was joking.

09:02.792 --> 09:04.168
Oh yeah. Us too.

09:04.752 --> 09:08.005
Obviously, we'd rather be sitting
with you and your new girlfriend.

09:08.673 --> 09:10.633
-Where's she at?
-Whoa. Okay.

09:10.716 --> 09:13.386
Uh, we're just keeping it
low-key right now.

09:13.469 --> 09:15.137
Is that why she's not sitting with us?

09:15.972 --> 09:17.890
No, no. She can sit wherever she wants to.

09:17.974 --> 09:21.894
Oof. Sounds like that is why.
You guys get into a fight?

09:21.978 --> 09:25.022
Can you stop stirring drama
where there isn't any?

09:25.106 --> 09:29.360
Really, this is a drama-free
situation… ship.

09:29.443 --> 09:31.654
Mm. No drama.

09:32.154 --> 09:34.365
Then why is she sitting with your ex?

09:43.374 --> 09:46.085
I didn't make some dumb fake handle
to troll you.

09:46.168 --> 09:48.546
If I'm gonna drag you,
I'll sign my name to it.

09:48.629 --> 09:49.755
I'm not a coward.

09:50.464 --> 09:52.341
-Then who is it?
-Could be anyone.

09:52.425 --> 09:54.468
With great power comes great haters.

09:55.052 --> 09:57.388
You don't need your haters to like you.

09:57.471 --> 09:59.140
You need them to fear you.

09:59.223 --> 10:01.392
And you need to do it fast,
before they spread.

10:01.475 --> 10:02.768
-They can spread?

10:04.645 --> 10:06.897
See? They're not afraid of you.

10:06.981 --> 10:09.942
I don't want them to be afraid.
I just want them to take the comment down.

10:23.998 --> 10:25.583
I know who my problem is.

10:28.044 --> 10:30.504
You need to take it down now.
Go ahead, I wanna watch it happen.

10:30.588 --> 10:31.589
You wanna watch me pee?

10:31.672 --> 10:33.466
No, gross. I need you
to take the comment down.

10:33.549 --> 10:35.968
I already publicly apologized.
Why troll me like this?

10:36.052 --> 10:38.054
Me trolling you?
You're the one trolling me.

10:38.137 --> 10:39.096
What do you mean?

10:39.972 --> 10:42.767
You know, people were finally starting
to call me Devon,

10:42.850 --> 10:47.063
and now it's just Stinky, Stinky, Stinky,
all over again.

10:47.146 --> 10:51.567
I was a man starting to walk upright,
and now I'm crawling again

10:51.651 --> 10:54.153
through the broken glass of my past.

10:54.236 --> 10:57.531
I'm sorry. I was just trying to help you.
I don't wanna be remembered as a bully.

10:57.615 --> 11:01.035
-You didn't. You made it worse. Can I pee?
-Not until you take the comment down.

11:01.118 --> 11:01.994
Stop bullying me!

11:02.078 --> 11:04.163
I'm not a bully.
What do I have to do to make it right?

11:04.246 --> 11:06.207
-Go away!
-Except that.

11:06.290 --> 11:09.085
I don't want any more attention
from you or anyone else.

11:10.127 --> 11:11.545
Go away!

11:11.629 --> 11:12.463
Erika?

11:13.089 --> 11:15.007
-It's not what it looks like.
-Yes, it is!

11:15.091 --> 11:17.718
-She won't leave me alone.
-I'll explain at the slideshow.

11:17.802 --> 11:19.011
Wait, the slideshow.

11:19.804 --> 11:21.972
-Devon, open up!
-No!

11:22.056 --> 11:24.600
-I've gotta fix my karma!

11:26.477 --> 11:29.980
Okay. Guess I'll just see you
at the slideshow… …then.

11:30.064 --> 11:31.649
But we only have 30 minutes.

11:31.732 --> 11:34.235
It's not enough time
to unlock it, switch it, and rework it.

11:34.318 --> 11:35.695
-I can't--
-Unlock it! Unlock it!

11:35.778 --> 11:37.863
-Okay, all right. God. Make it fast.

11:37.947 --> 11:39.865
Oh, Mama's got a baby to hypnotize.

11:39.949 --> 11:40.950
I'm coming!

11:44.370 --> 11:45.996
-Can we talk?
-Oh my God!

11:46.080 --> 11:48.207
Don't sneak up on me when I'm wired in.

11:48.290 --> 11:51.419
You said, "BRB DM."
And though you didn't BRB, I didn't move.

11:51.502 --> 11:53.629
So can we please talk?
'Cause I'm in a crisis.

11:53.713 --> 11:56.424
Okay, I'm sorry.
This legacy shit is complicated.

11:56.507 --> 11:58.342
What do you wanna talk about?
Talk while I work.

11:59.135 --> 12:01.929
-Do we have more pictures of Devon?
-Why? You absolved yourself.

12:02.012 --> 12:04.473
Apparently not. He's my troll.
He wrote the mean comment.

12:04.557 --> 12:07.810
So? It was one mean comment
from a kid who is partially justified.

12:07.893 --> 12:09.520
Partially justified?

12:09.603 --> 12:12.732
I completely fell on the sword.
I took ownership of that shit!

12:12.815 --> 12:14.817
Okay. Can I just have
two seconds of your time?

12:14.900 --> 12:16.569
Yeah. Two seconds in two seconds.

12:16.652 --> 12:19.405
Okay, we gotta go now.
I still need to render it.

12:19.488 --> 12:21.615
Seriously, I've been waiting
hours to talk to you.

12:21.699 --> 12:23.367
Gia, cut me some slack.

12:23.451 --> 12:24.452
Okay.

12:27.913 --> 12:28.873
I have!

12:29.457 --> 12:32.251
Any more… Any more slack,
and you'll just float away.

12:33.419 --> 12:35.296
-It's so fricking hot!

12:35.379 --> 12:36.255
Gosh, this is…

12:36.839 --> 12:38.132
This sucks, man.

12:38.215 --> 12:40.050
I can't take much more of this.

12:46.599 --> 12:48.434
Finally, they listened.

12:49.059 --> 12:51.562
I manifested the AC to turn back on.

12:55.065 --> 12:56.442
-You're welcome.
-Okay.

12:56.942 --> 12:58.861
-Thank you.
-Fine.

13:13.042 --> 13:14.960
Wow. I look so good.

13:27.097 --> 13:28.599
Canceled.

13:28.682 --> 13:30.976
Hey. Can I get those two seconds now?

13:31.060 --> 13:32.019
Yes.

13:32.102 --> 13:35.397
So I… I made out with Gavin,
and I really really like him.

13:35.481 --> 13:36.899
Sorry I called him a weirdo.

13:36.982 --> 13:38.776
But then he pretended
like it didn't happen.

13:39.401 --> 13:40.236
He's an asshole.

13:44.031 --> 13:47.034
And now the asshole is waving at me.
What do I do?

13:47.785 --> 13:50.663
Nothing. You deserve someone
who appreciates you. Like me.

13:55.251 --> 13:57.294
-Stinky!

13:57.378 --> 13:59.004
Who put that in there?

13:59.588 --> 14:00.756
It's Devon.

14:00.840 --> 14:02.550
Are those stink bubbles?

14:02.633 --> 14:04.176
No. It's a speech bubble.

14:06.470 --> 14:07.930
Are those stink lines?

14:08.973 --> 14:11.308
No. Those are emphasis lines!

14:12.351 --> 14:14.812
Stinky! Stinky!

14:16.564 --> 14:19.275
-His name is Devon!

14:19.358 --> 14:20.442
What do I do?

14:20.526 --> 14:22.820
Use your powers. Turn on some music.

14:27.157 --> 14:29.410
-It's party time!

14:39.503 --> 14:41.213
Erika! Erika!

14:45.968 --> 14:47.344
No drama, huh?

14:49.388 --> 14:51.223
Wow. Way to steal the show.

14:52.057 --> 14:53.434
I didn't put those pics up there.

14:53.517 --> 14:55.895
No, no, no. I did. You saved my ass.

14:55.978 --> 14:58.689
Erika Vu,
you are the new queen of Parkway.

14:59.815 --> 15:00.649
Erika.

15:01.609 --> 15:03.110
I told you to leave me alone.

15:08.198 --> 15:09.533
-Which way did he go?
-Who?

15:09.617 --> 15:10.492
Devon.

15:10.576 --> 15:12.745
Never mind.
I will follow the body spray.

15:12.828 --> 15:15.289
Or you can just do what he said
and you can leave him alone.

15:15.372 --> 15:16.540
We don't have time. The body--

15:16.624 --> 15:18.375
The body can wait.
Risking hate spread can't.

15:18.459 --> 15:20.085
It was one comment. Who cares?

15:20.169 --> 15:22.421
Ignore it. It was probably meant
to pull you down to earth.

15:22.504 --> 15:25.174
And if you want
to stay on earth until prom,

15:25.257 --> 15:27.301
then we need to ice your body ASAP.

15:28.052 --> 15:30.846
Okay. Okay. I will pick up the ice,
and I'll meet you there.

15:35.684 --> 15:37.853
Erika. Hey. Can we talk?

15:37.937 --> 15:40.522
-Oh. Uh, yeah, sure. Later.
-What's going on?

15:41.273 --> 15:42.691
-Nothing.
-Nothing? Nothing?

15:42.775 --> 15:45.569
-Then why are you acting so weird?
-What am I doing that's weird?

15:45.653 --> 15:47.237
Well, can you look at me for a second?

15:47.321 --> 15:49.990
It's all the weird…
Sitting with Riley at lunch

15:50.074 --> 15:52.159
and taking photos of Devon
in the bathroom.

15:52.242 --> 15:55.871
And uploading 30 photos of yourself…
…in the slideshow.

15:55.955 --> 15:59.208
And the photos of us?
Like, I thought we were being low-key.

16:00.292 --> 16:02.461
Okay. I get it. You wanna define things.

16:02.544 --> 16:03.545
What?

16:04.755 --> 16:06.382
No, no, I mean…

16:06.465 --> 16:08.008
Well, like, I mean, maybe a little.

16:08.092 --> 16:10.469
I thought we were on the same page
about being cool.

16:10.552 --> 16:12.137
That you were cool and I was cool.

16:12.221 --> 16:15.182
But now it feels like, you know,
we're not cool. So are we cool?

16:15.265 --> 16:17.267
-Yeah, look, we're cool.
-Good.

16:17.351 --> 16:19.728
But it just… It feels like--

16:19.812 --> 16:21.188
Hey. Ssh.

16:21.271 --> 16:23.774
I'm good. You're good.

16:23.857 --> 16:25.526
We're good. Okay? So…

16:26.652 --> 16:29.029
I will swing by your house in an hour,

16:29.113 --> 16:30.864
and why don't you go do some

16:32.241 --> 16:33.117
Jake stuff?

16:43.127 --> 16:44.294
I know where you live, Devon.

16:44.378 --> 16:46.672
I'm gonna find you,
and we're gonna work this out!

16:47.965 --> 16:49.967
-Do you see yourself right now?
-Oh God.

16:50.050 --> 16:53.012
You're giving me Helen Who vibes.
Chasing people to like you?

16:53.095 --> 16:55.222
Well, isn't that the point?
Being liked by everybody?

16:55.305 --> 16:58.267
No. Don't play the hater. Game the hate.

16:59.184 --> 17:02.187
-What does that mean?
-It means make the hate work for you.

17:02.271 --> 17:04.982
As they say,
"All publicity is good publicity."

17:06.567 --> 17:09.236
Happy to get into it with you
if you wanna hang out tonight.

17:09.945 --> 17:12.322
It's a onetime offer.
Now or never.

17:12.406 --> 17:14.992
I can't. I have plans. I'm so sorry.

17:19.163 --> 17:20.831
Oh God. Oh God.

17:27.004 --> 17:29.381
Hey. I've got 20 more bags of ice
by the side of the road.

17:29.465 --> 17:30.340
I gotta make it quick.

17:30.424 --> 17:31.759
-Unless you wanna do shifts.
-No.

17:31.842 --> 17:34.928
No, you don't get to hang out
with Jake while I do the dirty work.

17:35.012 --> 17:37.473
You have been blowing me off
and ignoring me all day.

17:37.556 --> 17:40.184
Now you expect me to ice your dead body
so you can blow me off again?

17:40.267 --> 17:44.229
No, I've been blowing off everyone,
Jake C and my family, to be here with you.

17:44.730 --> 17:46.315
Shit.

17:47.107 --> 17:49.193
Family dinner. I forgot about that.

17:49.276 --> 17:52.237
You and this body
are my number one priority.

17:52.321 --> 17:54.531
Today happened so fast.

17:54.615 --> 17:57.785
You know that I don't know the first thing
about being the center of attention

17:57.868 --> 18:00.496
or having a troll,
who refuses to take down his comment,

18:00.579 --> 18:02.748
even though I've tried to reason and beg

18:02.831 --> 18:05.375
and make him the star
of a very important senior moment.

18:06.043 --> 18:08.128
It is a lot to process, but, honestly,

18:08.212 --> 18:12.091
I know that I would not be
Erika Vu Bitch without you.

18:14.134 --> 18:17.346
You are the reason that I…
we have gotten this far.

18:20.307 --> 18:24.144
You know what? I… I will handle the ice.
You go to family dinner.

18:24.228 --> 18:27.648
No, I can't do that to you,
even if it might be my last one, I…

18:27.731 --> 18:29.316
-I just can't.
-Go!

18:30.067 --> 18:31.401
-Are you sure?
-I said go!

18:32.277 --> 18:33.362
'Kay.

18:40.577 --> 18:41.453
Delete.

18:43.205 --> 18:44.998
Sorry for trolling you, bestie.

18:45.707 --> 18:47.167
You'll thank me later.

19:01.473 --> 19:03.267
-Yes, girl!

19:08.897 --> 19:10.566
That bitch!
