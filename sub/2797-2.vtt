00:21.250 --> 00:23.208
(boy) This is going to be awesome!

00:25.625 --> 00:29.917
Ah, the annual Freshman field trip
to Mount Chuck.

00:30.000 --> 00:33.458
(mimicking a man's voice)
The world's only man-made volcano.

00:33.542 --> 00:35.166
Glory awaits, Howard.

00:35.250 --> 00:37.375
-(chattering indistinctly)
-When we spit in volcano,

00:37.458 --> 00:39.959
we'll be joining Norrisville High's
all-time greats.

00:40.041 --> 00:42.458
Of course we won't actually
be going up the volcano,

00:42.542 --> 00:45.333
that's for hooligans,
daredevils and tomfoolers.

00:45.417 --> 00:50.625
Nope, we're headed to the informative
and school board approved museum of silt.

00:50.709 --> 00:54.875
-(all groan)
-Silt, silt, silt!

00:54.959 --> 00:57.500
Now, before we go in,
I want to say one thing.

00:57.583 --> 01:00.291
(laughs)
Oh, Jerry.

01:00.375 --> 01:05.458
Every year, some numbskull tries
to sneak up the volcano to spit in it.

01:05.542 --> 01:08.291
That's us, Howard. We are that numbskull.

01:08.375 --> 01:10.917
Which is why we're using the buddy system.

01:11.000 --> 01:14.291
If you stray more than five feet
from your buddy,

01:14.375 --> 01:16.709
you both get a month's detention.

01:16.792 --> 01:18.375
-(all grumbling)
-For added security,

01:18.458 --> 01:21.291
I'm pairing a responsible student
with a numbskull.

01:21.375 --> 01:24.250
-(Mrs. Driscoll) Bucky, you're with Randy.
-(moans)

01:24.333 --> 01:27.041
-Flute girl, you're with Howard.
-Ooh!

01:27.125 --> 01:31.959
-(Mrs. Driscoll) Julian, with Stevens.
-(plays sad tone)

01:32.041 --> 01:34.917
(growls)
Oh, great. What do we do now, huh?

01:35.000 --> 01:38.000
I mean, I was all excited to sneak off
and luge into that volcano.

01:38.083 --> 01:40.583
And scarf down some victory nachos.

01:40.667 --> 01:42.375
If it was easy, it wouldn't be awesome.

01:42.458 --> 01:44.375
We just have to find a way
to get up there.

01:44.458 --> 01:45.875
Rendezvous at Checkpoint Bravo...

01:45.959 --> 01:49.125
No funny business, you two.
I got my sockets on you.

01:51.667 --> 01:57.500
Viceroy, when I told you to design
an evil, new creation to catch the ninja,

01:57.583 --> 02:00.834
did I say anything about it being
a disgusting, useless blob?

02:00.917 --> 02:03.166
Hmm, let me check my notes.

02:05.458 --> 02:07.792
<i>I don't care if it's disgusting</i>
<i>or useless,</i>

02:07.875 --> 02:09.208
<i>I just want a blob!</i>

02:09.291 --> 02:12.291
Get rid of them! All of them!

02:12.375 --> 02:14.458
-(groans)
-(beeping)

02:14.542 --> 02:16.917
Gene Levine, the disposal machine,

02:17.000 --> 02:20.542
for when it absolutely,
positutely gotsta be disappeared.

02:20.625 --> 02:24.709
Gene-o, Viceroy.
I need something disappeared.

02:24.792 --> 02:27.250
-Positutely?
-Positutely.

02:27.333 --> 02:29.166
(male narrator) <i>Mount Chuck,</i>

02:29.250 --> 02:31.625
<i>Norrisville's most recognizable landmark.</i>

02:31.709 --> 02:34.542

02:40.542 --> 02:42.959

02:44.208 --> 02:45.291
Picture it, Bucky.

02:45.375 --> 02:48.834
Oceans of virgin silt,
just waiting to be discovered.

02:48.917 --> 02:50.625
I'm not breaking the rules, Randy.

02:50.709 --> 02:53.125
There's silt up there Mrs. Driscoll
has never seen before!

02:53.208 --> 02:55.375
(Randy)
And circumferences she couldn't imagine.

02:55.458 --> 02:57.458
-(moans)
-(vibrates)

02:59.083 --> 03:00.208
Would you excuse me, Bucky?

03:00.291 --> 03:02.542
I gotta, you know... something.

03:04.834 --> 03:05.667

I don't have time
for first day ninja stuff,

03:15.917 --> 03:18.583

Bucky up a volcano here!

03:21.709 --> 03:23.000
What do you say, partner?

03:23.083 --> 03:25.875
You volca-know you wanna come with me.

03:25.959 --> 03:28.041
You do make a convincing zing.

03:30.542 --> 03:33.959
(gasps)
My snacks!

03:34.041 --> 03:37.083
Looks like Gene positutely missed one.

03:37.166 --> 03:40.709
-(squeaking)
-(chuckles) Aw...

03:40.792 --> 03:42.667
You are kind of cute.

03:42.750 --> 03:44.125
-(chuckling)
-Stop it, Howard.

03:44.208 --> 03:45.291
-I mean it!
-(chuckling)

03:45.375 --> 03:46.417
This isn't funny!

03:47.500 --> 03:50.583
-I'm telling Mrs. Driscoll!
-Five foot rule, huh?

03:50.667 --> 03:52.417
Yeah. She's gotta go wherever I go.

03:52.500 --> 03:54.041
That is not funny.

03:54.125 --> 03:56.667
(squeaking)

03:56.750 --> 04:00.583
Viceroy, I disappeared all them amoebas
and such.

04:00.667 --> 04:03.041
We gonna go cash
or charge on this one here?

04:03.125 --> 04:04.959
Whoa! How'd I miss you, little fella?

04:06.834 --> 04:08.458
(frightened squeaks)

04:08.542 --> 04:11.458
Nicholas? Nicholas!

04:13.375 --> 04:15.291
-(squeaking)
-(horn honking)

04:17.083 --> 04:19.875
Nicholas, I'm coming, sweet thing!

04:24.125 --> 04:27.750
Hey, this is the same
as the silt at the bottom!

04:27.834 --> 04:30.500
Our most finest hour is upon us.

04:30.583 --> 04:33.542
This is your greatest idea ever.

04:33.625 --> 04:35.834
You guys are idiots.

04:36.500 --> 04:39.208
Ready... set... hork!

04:41.750 --> 04:46.542
-Epic.
-Hey, where are the victory nachos?

04:53.083 --> 04:55.000
All right there, little guy.

04:55.083 --> 04:57.208
Let's get you good and disappeared, huh?

04:59.959 --> 05:02.041
(growls)
Give it back.

05:02.125 --> 05:03.166
-Hey, what gives?

05:03.250 --> 05:06.709
You are not disappearing my Nicholas.

05:06.792 --> 05:10.750
I got a signed contract here
for the removal of all slimy things.

05:10.834 --> 05:12.625
I don't care about your contract.

05:12.709 --> 05:15.875
That was a legally binding document,
there, Viceroy.

05:15.959 --> 05:17.375
(screams)
Nicholas!

05:17.917 --> 05:20.750
Don't panic. Daddy's coming for you, baby.

05:20.834 --> 05:22.959
-Help me find a way down there.
-Oh, no.

05:23.041 --> 05:26.834
Then all them other amoebas I disappeared
is alive and gooey down there.

05:26.917 --> 05:30.208
They're probably plotting revenge
on Gene Levine right now.

05:30.291 --> 05:31.834
They're completely harmless.

05:31.917 --> 05:36.834
It would take a very specific blend of
rare, toxic chemicals to destabilize them.

05:36.917 --> 05:38.542
Why, you'd need notodextrium...

05:38.625 --> 05:41.250
Sodium phosphate, and xanthan gum?

05:41.333 --> 05:43.458
You tell me,
how am I supposed to resist that?

05:43.542 --> 05:45.583
Those 'chos were for both of us.

05:45.667 --> 05:47.750
I carried them all the way up here,

05:47.834 --> 05:52.500
-you should share with me.
-But you ate all of them!

05:52.583 --> 05:54.917
-(both straining)
-(Howard)... take my nacho!

05:55.000 --> 05:59.542
Ooh! Oh, way to go, Cunningham.

06:06.083 --> 06:07.750
(growling)

06:07.834 --> 06:11.000
You betrayed me with wordplay, Randy.

06:11.083 --> 06:13.125
Come on, Bucky, let's go.

06:14.083 --> 06:15.709
Bucky, I'm sorry.

06:16.959 --> 06:18.291
Where do you think you're going?

06:18.375 --> 06:20.291
I'm sorry, Cunningham, five foot rule.

06:20.375 --> 06:22.583
(sighs)
Huh?

06:23.375 --> 06:24.917
-What?
-(growling)

06:25.000 --> 06:27.083
That's probably bad.

06:27.166 --> 06:29.500
(screams)

06:31.083 --> 06:32.500
(screams)

06:32.583 --> 06:34.583
The volcano is erupting!

06:34.667 --> 06:36.333
(wailing)

06:36.417 --> 06:38.458
What happened to Bucky? What was that?

06:38.542 --> 06:39.709
All great questions.

06:39.792 --> 06:42.250
Why don't we discuss it,
oh, I don't know...

06:42.333 --> 06:44.166
-... back at the bus!
-(screams)

06:44.250 --> 06:46.041
Hurry it up there, Viceroy.

06:46.125 --> 06:49.125
Just lower me down, I can see him.

06:53.041 --> 06:55.083
-(shouts)
-Whoops and such.

06:55.166 --> 06:56.625
-(engine revving)
-I'm out of here.

06:56.709 --> 06:57.792
Uh-oh.

07:01.375 --> 07:02.375
Ooh.

07:06.208 --> 07:08.625
Don't you worry, Daddy's here.

07:08.709 --> 07:10.458
Bad amoeba, bad!

07:11.208 --> 07:13.208
(squeals)

07:16.125 --> 07:17.792
Come here, baby, you're okay.

07:18.917 --> 07:22.041
Naughty, Nicholas,
that was Daddy's flamethrower.

07:24.041 --> 07:27.709
(screaming)
Stop, stop!

07:27.792 --> 07:30.041
(Howard) It put its tentacle in my mouth!

07:30.125 --> 07:32.709
-Howard?
-(growling)

07:32.792 --> 07:34.000
Yah!

07:35.917 --> 07:39.625
Time to un-endanger the innocent.

07:42.417 --> 07:43.375
Ninja slice!

07:45.000 --> 07:46.083
Totally worked.

07:46.166 --> 07:49.834
-(growling)
-Ninja, it's not working!

07:49.917 --> 07:51.458
Yeah, thanks, I caught that.

07:53.625 --> 07:55.709
(shouting)

07:56.458 --> 07:57.917
Ah-ha, not even close!

08:02.125 --> 08:04.959
(squeals)

08:05.041 --> 08:07.542
(growls)

08:07.625 --> 08:10.375
-(moans)
-(squealing)

08:10.458 --> 08:12.041
(laughing)

08:13.250 --> 08:15.333
Fire.
(chuckles)

08:15.417 --> 08:16.709
That's it!

08:16.792 --> 08:20.458
It's like they say, sometimes you've got
to fight ectoplasm with lava.

08:21.583 --> 08:23.041
(Bucky) No one's ever said that!

08:23.709 --> 08:24.667
(grunting)

08:28.375 --> 08:30.375
Come on! No, no, no, no, no, no!

08:30.458 --> 08:33.792
-Boom, lava!
-Um, that's your plan?

08:33.875 --> 08:36.291
Douse us with molten hot lava?

08:36.375 --> 08:39.166
Got to admit, Ninja, not one of your best.

08:39.250 --> 08:42.417
-That was just phase one.
-Then what's phase two?

08:42.500 --> 08:44.125
(laugh)
That.

08:47.000 --> 08:51.917
-(shouts indistinctly)
-(screaming)

08:53.834 --> 08:55.500
-(Bucky) Oh, boy!
-(moaning)

08:55.583 --> 08:57.709
Hey, you're safe.

08:58.291 --> 09:01.166
-Hurray!
-Thanks, Ninja.

09:01.250 --> 09:02.750
Catch you on the flip-flop.

09:04.875 --> 09:08.000
Who would hide an amoeba monster
in a man-made volcano?

09:08.083 --> 09:10.917
-(yelps)
-Viceroy, I should've known.

09:11.000 --> 09:14.041
Ninja, please, you have to save Nicholas.

09:14.125 --> 09:16.875
-He's defenseless!
-(Randy) Nicholas? What's a Nicholas?

09:16.959 --> 09:18.917
Oh, Nicholas! Meet me at the top.

09:19.000 --> 09:21.625
-Okay.
-(squeaks)

09:22.375 --> 09:23.959
Ninja amoeba snatch!

09:24.041 --> 09:26.875
-(rumbling)
-(grunting)

09:26.959 --> 09:28.792
You're all kinds of shasty.

09:28.875 --> 09:33.208
My Nicholas!
Oh, Ninja, how can I ever thank you?

09:33.291 --> 09:35.166
Uh, you could take a vacation

09:35.250 --> 09:37.375
from helping my arch-enemy
plot to kill me!

09:37.458 --> 09:41.291
I do have a time share in Provence. Done!

09:41.375 --> 09:45.375
-Uh... Yeah!
-Come on, come on, come on.

09:45.959 --> 09:46.875
(screams)

09:47.792 --> 09:50.709
-Whoa.
-(growling)

09:50.792 --> 09:52.291
Ninja, I'm getting out of here!

09:57.834 --> 10:00.750
(screaming)

10:04.667 --> 10:06.875
-(Bucky) Ninja!
-Ninja, did you plan that?

10:06.959 --> 10:08.625
Uh, yes.

10:08.709 --> 10:10.291
I mean, yes!

10:10.375 --> 10:12.792
I seriously appreciate this, Ninja.

10:12.875 --> 10:16.458
Yeah! We were pretty shoobed
for a minute there.

10:16.542 --> 10:19.417
Wait, Randy's missing. Oh, this is awful!

10:19.500 --> 10:21.875
Aw, that means so much to...

10:21.959 --> 10:24.750
that boy I've never heard of.

10:24.834 --> 10:28.500
Don't you worry, I'll bring
your friend back safe and sound.

10:28.583 --> 10:31.667
Good. 'Cause I'll get a month's detention
if I show up without him.

10:31.750 --> 10:33.500
I can't handle that kind of time.

10:33.583 --> 10:35.792
(groans)
Get them to the bus.

10:35.875 --> 10:41.375
Okay, let's see who earned themselves
a nice, fat detention.

10:41.458 --> 10:43.458
(Mrs. Driscoll)
Stevens, check. Julian, check.

10:44.875 --> 10:47.000
Weinerman, check. Flute girl, check.

10:47.083 --> 10:49.583
-Hensletter, check.
-(shivering)

10:50.041 --> 10:53.542
-Cunningham.
-Bucky and I are both here, Mrs. Driscoll.

10:53.625 --> 10:55.333
We are? We are!

10:55.417 --> 10:58.375
Everyone's here! No detentions.

10:58.458 --> 11:01.166
(mimicking male voice)
Ice cream for everyone!

11:01.250 --> 11:03.625
You always did have a sweet tooth.

11:03.709 --> 11:04.750
(gasps)

11:04.834 --> 11:07.375
-(Randy) Mission accomplished.
-And a picture to prove it.

11:07.458 --> 11:09.000
(Randy) Epic.

11:10.625 --> 11:12.291
Mmm, Provence.

11:12.375 --> 11:16.458
Ew... You're cute,
but you don't taste so good, baby.

11:18.041 --> 11:19.500
Come on, move it!

11:19.583 --> 11:23.166
Howard, I have this nagging suspicion
we may still be faceless Freshmen

11:23.250 --> 11:25.291
-here at Norrisville High.
-Watch out, kid.

11:25.375 --> 11:28.250
What are you talking about?
They love me at this school.

11:28.333 --> 11:30.125
Hence my awesome nickname,

11:30.208 --> 11:33.291
-the Watch Out Kid.
-Watch out, kid.

11:33.375 --> 11:36.333
You're not the Watch Out Kid.
They're saying, "Watch out, kid!"

11:36.417 --> 11:38.834
Oh! Then, yeah,
we're 100 percent faceless.

11:38.917 --> 11:42.750
We need to do something that separates us
from the rest of these clowns.

11:42.834 --> 11:44.333
And baton twirlers.

11:44.417 --> 11:48.125
And accordion players...
Did we miss an e-blast or something?

11:48.208 --> 11:50.000
(Heidi) <i>Hey, it's your best BFF, Heidi.</i>

11:50.083 --> 11:50.917
Status update!

11:51.000 --> 11:53.709
Due to the fact that my judges
decided to try out for talent show

11:53.792 --> 11:55.625
instead of judging it,
like they promised...

11:55.709 --> 11:58.375
Yes! We broke a promise! Yes!

11:58.917 --> 12:01.000
...auditions are postponed indefinitely.

12:01.083 --> 12:05.333
-(all groan)
-(sad note plays)

12:05.417 --> 12:08.458
That's it! Howard,
we're going to judge the talent show.

12:08.542 --> 12:11.458
Judging's stupid.
I give that idea a one out of ten.

12:11.542 --> 12:15.000
Come on! Everyone knows
the judges are the real stars.

12:15.083 --> 12:18.625
If we get our judge on proper,
everybody will know our names!

12:18.709 --> 12:21.375
-Watch out, kid!
-(Howard) I'm in!

12:22.458 --> 12:23.667
<i>'Sup! It's your girl, Heidi.</i>

12:23.750 --> 12:25.917
Me-casting live, from the auditorium

12:26.000 --> 12:28.625
where my super sweet little brother
and his best friend, Andy...

12:28.709 --> 12:31.166
Randy. Name's Randy.
Known you my whole life.

12:31.250 --> 12:33.291
...have agreed to judge
the talent show auditions.

12:33.375 --> 12:36.417
Yey! Wonk this up,
and I will webcast that video of you two

12:36.500 --> 12:38.583
-taking a bath together.
-We were three!

12:38.667 --> 12:41.709
-Not. That. Video.
-Ooh...

12:41.792 --> 12:45.291
Ah, yes! Judges! This is so Bruce!

12:50.500 --> 12:53.792
I'm thinking we run the old nice judge,
mean judge.

12:53.875 --> 12:55.834
-I'm listening.
-No, no, no, that's it.

12:55.917 --> 12:57.750
I'm the nice judge, you're the mean judge.

12:57.834 --> 12:59.458
Why can't I be the nice judge?

13:00.458 --> 13:02.291
(laughter)

13:02.375 --> 13:04.834
Oh, I thought you were serious
for a second.

13:04.917 --> 13:06.083
I am such a jerk.

13:06.709 --> 13:08.083
(laughter)

13:13.083 --> 13:16.583
(sniffs)
Mmm, there's a delicious desperation

13:16.667 --> 13:20.792
in the air today.
This could only mean one thing.

13:20.875 --> 13:24.709
-Talent show auditions.
-(squeals)

13:24.792 --> 13:29.000
Nothing dances on the tongue
quite like the dashed dreams

13:29.083 --> 13:33.875
of the delusional.
(cackling)

13:33.959 --> 13:36.750
(squeaking)

13:36.834 --> 13:39.583
-Please stop doing that.
-(squeaks forlornly)

13:43.875 --> 13:45.583
(groans)

13:45.667 --> 13:47.667
<i>-♪ Who my bro's, yo? ♪</i>
<i>-♪ We're your bro's, yo! ♪</i>

13:47.750 --> 13:50.000
<i>-♪ Who my bro's, yo? ♪</i>
<i>-♪ We're your bro's, yo! ♪</i>

13:50.083 --> 13:52.208
<i>-♪ Who my bro's, yo? ♪</i>
<i>-♪ We're your bro's, yo! ♪</i>

13:52.291 --> 13:54.291
<i>♪ We're your bro's, yo!</i>
<i>We're your bro's, yo! ♪</i>

13:54.375 --> 13:56.792
-(feedback rings)
-(all groaning)

13:57.959 --> 14:00.750
Babbling, incoherent... I loved it!

14:00.834 --> 14:02.375
What did you think, Howard?

14:02.458 --> 14:06.583
Loved it.
Yo, bro's, you're in the talent show!

14:06.667 --> 14:08.458
Uh, Howard, a word?

14:08.542 --> 14:09.625
What are you doing?

14:09.709 --> 14:11.458
I'm the nice judge, you're the mean judge.

14:11.542 --> 14:13.125
I was just being honest, I liked them.

14:13.208 --> 14:16.125
If people are going to remember us,
we have to stick to our characters.

14:16.208 --> 14:18.291
I pretend to like them,
no matter what, and...

14:18.375 --> 14:20.208
-I mean it up?
-Way up.

14:20.291 --> 14:21.208
You got it, jerkface.

14:21.291 --> 14:23.542
Hey, I'm Juggo, the juggling clown.

14:23.625 --> 14:26.333
Thought I'd do some juggling,
and maybe some clowning.

14:26.417 --> 14:29.291
Oh, fantastic, Juggo.
Let's see what you got.

14:29.375 --> 14:31.834
-Remember... mean.
-(grunts)

14:31.917 --> 14:34.750
-(up-tempo music plays)
-Stop! Stop!

14:34.834 --> 14:37.583
-(moans)
-You call that juggling?

14:37.667 --> 14:40.375
All you did was throw a bunch of junk
in the air and then catch it.

14:40.417 --> 14:42.291
But that's... juggling!

14:42.375 --> 14:44.875
And I can't get enough of it!

14:44.959 --> 14:46.792
What's with his bike? One wheel?

14:46.875 --> 14:49.166
(scoffs)
Come back when you got two wheels!

14:49.250 --> 14:52.041
-And regular guy shoes.
-(laughter)

14:52.125 --> 14:53.417
Hmm?

14:53.500 --> 14:54.709
Oh, and I almost forgot.

14:54.792 --> 14:57.041
(blows raspberry)
Off my stage.

14:57.125 --> 14:59.709
(laughter)

15:00.500 --> 15:04.291
-Well done, mean judge.
-And to you, nice judge.

15:04.375 --> 15:07.166
-Who's next?
-Auditions are heating up.

15:07.250 --> 15:09.583
Who's got the juice
to make it in Norrisville?

15:09.667 --> 15:13.166
-(sobbing)
-Not that guy.

15:13.250 --> 15:16.583
-(sobbing continues)
-Mmm... Mmmm...

15:16.667 --> 15:20.709
Bingo.
(cackling)

15:21.542 --> 15:22.500
(grunts)

15:24.417 --> 15:26.333
(growling)

15:26.417 --> 15:29.583
Okay! Up next looks like
we have Theresa Fowler,

15:29.667 --> 15:32.125
and her amazing, twirling sticks.

15:32.208 --> 15:33.834
I'm gonna end this chick.

15:33.917 --> 15:37.500
And I'm gonna boost her spirits
with a totally fake compliment.

15:37.583 --> 15:39.375
-Nice judge!
-Mean judge!

15:41.709 --> 15:42.792
(screaming)

15:42.875 --> 15:45.542
Juggo? Howard, you're gonna have
to fly solo on this one.

15:45.625 --> 15:47.458
-It's...
-Yeah, yeah, ninja o'clock.

15:47.542 --> 15:49.875
No worries, I got this.

15:49.959 --> 15:53.834
-Insult blaster is locked and loaded.
-(gun cocking, firing)

15:53.917 --> 15:57.542
-(gulping)
-(panting)

15:57.625 --> 16:00.083
-Yah!
-(screeching)

16:00.166 --> 16:02.709
Let's see you juggle my ninja rings!

16:05.542 --> 16:07.750
Ugh, now you're just showing off, Juggo.

16:07.834 --> 16:12.000
(laughs)
Twirling sticks? More like hurling sticks.

16:12.083 --> 16:14.417
I almost blew chunks watching that.

16:14.500 --> 16:18.542
-(laughter)
-Off my stage!

16:20.875 --> 16:22.125
Ninja knife-sicles!

16:25.375 --> 16:28.458
(grunting)

16:28.542 --> 16:30.709
-(squealing)
-What the juice?

16:30.792 --> 16:32.458
I trashed your pins.
(grunts)

16:33.291 --> 16:34.458
Where's the destankage?

16:37.458 --> 16:39.417
Unicycle, natch.

16:39.500 --> 16:44.083
Ninja run, ninja slide, ninja snap!

16:48.959 --> 16:50.875
-(Randy) You okay, Juggo?
-Actually, Ninja,

16:50.959 --> 16:52.834
my day's been kind of up and down.

16:54.667 --> 16:57.709
-(screeching)
-I should probably, you know...

16:57.792 --> 16:58.875
...fight that.

16:58.959 --> 17:01.291
Judging by your amazing twirling sticks,

17:01.375 --> 17:03.083
I take it you're Theresa...

17:03.667 --> 17:05.417
Not cool, Fowler.

17:07.250 --> 17:10.125
Really? An accordion, Dave.

17:10.208 --> 17:13.291
An accordion. What should I do, guys?

17:13.375 --> 17:17.458
-(all) Off my stage!
-Off... my... stage!

17:18.041 --> 17:20.834
-(all laugh, chanting)
-Off my stage!

17:20.917 --> 17:23.166
-Off my stage!
-Mean judge!

17:23.250 --> 17:26.542
-Off my stage! Off my stage!
-Another reject?

17:26.625 --> 17:27.875
What is up with those judges?

17:27.959 --> 17:30.041
I never should've trusted Howard
and Sandy.

17:34.625 --> 17:35.875
Oh, stank breath.

17:38.834 --> 17:41.709
-(moaning)
-Theresa, you're going to be...

17:41.792 --> 17:45.625
-(growling)
-This is getting ridiculous.

17:46.458 --> 17:47.709
Oh, that'll work.

17:49.083 --> 17:50.333
Ninja baton flip kick!

17:54.125 --> 17:56.250
What is with all the stank?

17:58.417 --> 18:02.875
Yah! Ha! Ha!
Where do you think you're going?

18:02.959 --> 18:04.500
Ooh, a vent. I wasn't expecting that.

18:04.583 --> 18:06.917
I could do this all day.

18:07.000 --> 18:09.583
-(cackling)
-(squeaking)

18:12.166 --> 18:13.917
Come on, Nomicon, help a ninja out.

18:14.000 --> 18:16.583
I can't stop the stank
if I don't know where it comes from.

18:17.208 --> 18:19.458
(Randy) Oh, I just got the shivs.

18:19.542 --> 18:20.709
<i>Centuries ago,</i>

18:20.792 --> 18:22.875
<i>a great war was waged</i>
<i>between good and evil,</i>

18:22.959 --> 18:24.166
<i>between ninja and sorcerer.</i>

18:24.250 --> 18:25.875
<i>Too powerful to destroy,</i>

18:25.959 --> 18:28.250
<i>the dark one was locked deep underground,</i>

18:28.333 --> 18:30.834
<i>his prison sealed with a sacred stone.</i>

18:30.917 --> 18:33.500
<i>In the darkness he waits, wreaking havoc.</i>

18:33.583 --> 18:36.667
<i>Possessing the vulnerable,</i>
<i>using that which they hold most dear,</i>

18:36.750 --> 18:38.709
<i>amassing power from chaos.</i>

18:38.792 --> 18:40.417
<i>Once he gains enough power</i>

18:40.500 --> 18:42.583
<i>he will escape, and darkness will reign.</i>

18:42.667 --> 18:46.875
<i>Preventing this is the sacred duty</i>
<i>of the ninja.</i>

18:47.959 --> 18:50.792
The sorcerer is stanking
vulnerable students.

18:50.875 --> 18:53.500
Students who have been crushed
by the mean judge.

18:53.583 --> 18:56.458
-(all) Off my stage!
-I have to stop Howard.

18:57.041 --> 18:59.834
I got my eyes all ready
to see dancing fish,

18:59.917 --> 19:01.750
and then you guys come out.

19:01.834 --> 19:04.542
You're not fish, you're not even dancing.

19:04.625 --> 19:08.041
-Uh, we haven't started yet.
-(audience) Ooh!

19:08.125 --> 19:10.375
I like you, you're feisty.

19:10.458 --> 19:11.875
You know what else you are?

19:11.959 --> 19:14.291
(audience) Off my stage!

19:14.375 --> 19:17.625
-(cheering)
-(humming up-tempo tune)

19:17.709 --> 19:22.208
-(sobbing)
-Get it together, ladies.

19:22.291 --> 19:24.500
There's no crying in dance.

19:24.583 --> 19:26.083
Howard, you have to stop.

19:26.166 --> 19:28.625
Every time you reject somebody
they get stank from...

19:28.709 --> 19:32.000
-Forget it, Cunningham. Listen.
-Howard! Howard! Howard!

19:32.083 --> 19:34.917
The plan worked!
We're not faceless Freshman anymore.

19:35.000 --> 19:37.333
Well, I'm not.
You've got some catching up to do.

19:37.417 --> 19:39.709
-I've created a monster...
-(chuckling)

19:39.792 --> 19:41.834
-(laughing)
-... who creates monsters!

19:41.917 --> 19:43.917
(chittering)

19:44.000 --> 19:46.375
Whoa. That's not part of the routine.

19:46.458 --> 19:49.792
-(screeching)
-Ugh...

19:49.875 --> 19:52.709
Cunningham, I'm not saying you were right,

19:52.792 --> 19:55.542
-but help!
-(screeching)

19:55.625 --> 19:58.333
(cackling)

20:00.458 --> 20:05.542
-(all screaming)
-(all shouting indistinctly)

20:05.625 --> 20:07.917
Getting a little heavy
on the chaos in this piece.

20:08.000 --> 20:10.458
What are you doing?
Everybody loves mean judge.

20:10.542 --> 20:13.583
Smoke bomb!
(grunts)

20:13.667 --> 20:16.500
Ninja, you got served... in the face!

20:16.583 --> 20:18.208
Dance fight!

20:18.291 --> 20:21.083
(techno music plays)

20:21.166 --> 20:23.083
Dance fight!

20:24.083 --> 20:26.458
Sweet ninja, it's a krump attack!

20:26.542 --> 20:30.375
(grunting)

20:33.041 --> 20:35.458
Morgan, can you give us
the deets on the sitch?

20:35.542 --> 20:37.542
-What does that mean?
-Tell us what's happening.

20:37.625 --> 20:39.834
(scoffs)
Right now the girls are setting up

20:39.917 --> 20:41.500
for a backside dirty Filbert.

20:41.583 --> 20:43.291
(Randy) Do those words even go together?

20:43.375 --> 20:45.375
If you're a dancer they do.

20:45.458 --> 20:46.959
It's the thing we hold most dear.

20:47.041 --> 20:49.458
(growling)

20:49.542 --> 20:52.000
-Whoa-boy.
-(shuddering)

20:54.750 --> 20:56.917
The thing you hold most dear, eh?

20:57.000 --> 21:00.333
Sorry, girls. Looks like your winning move
just cost you the show.

21:00.417 --> 21:03.208
Ninja tripping balls! Yah!

21:03.291 --> 21:06.041
(screaming)

21:09.417 --> 21:12.458
Now that's talent.
I give it a six out of ten.

21:12.542 --> 21:15.000
-A six?
-Now it's a five, you wanna keep going?

21:15.083 --> 21:16.166
I'm gonna give you a five.

21:16.250 --> 21:17.750
-Smoke bomb!
-(moaning)

21:17.834 --> 21:21.417
You guys better not even think
about mutating at Regionals.

21:23.917 --> 21:27.000
All I want to do is create a little chaos.

21:27.083 --> 21:32.125
Bust out of this hole, enslave the world.

21:32.208 --> 21:34.667
(sighs)
Is that so wrong?

21:35.500 --> 21:36.750
(chittering)

21:36.834 --> 21:40.750
What's up? It's H-dub, hitting you live
from the N-ville High T-show.

21:40.834 --> 21:42.458
(Randy) Do we really have to do this?

21:42.542 --> 21:44.709
(Heidi)
You booked the stage for four hours.

21:44.792 --> 21:46.917
Back From The Yo Bros
are the only act you let in.

21:47.000 --> 21:49.834
-Now get out there.
-This is all your fault.

21:49.917 --> 21:52.083
We were totally unqualified to be judges.

21:52.166 --> 21:55.625
-(up-tempo music starts, stops)
-(audience booing)

21:55.709 --> 21:59.125
Hey, Howard, off... my... stage.

21:59.208 --> 22:02.959
-Me? What about Randy?
-You too, Randy.

22:03.041 --> 22:05.250
(audience laughs)

22:05.333 --> 22:07.417
Sweet! They know both our names.

22:07.500 --> 22:10.208
Plan worked! Ten out of ten!

22:10.291 --> 22:12.917
(audience continues booing)

22:14.750 --> 22:18.250
-(groans)
-Hmm, chocolate.

22:18.834 --> 22:22.458
(theme music playing)
