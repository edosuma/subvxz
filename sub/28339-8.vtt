WEBVTT

00:00.010 --> 00:02.204
- They ready?
- As ready as they're ever gonna be.

00:02.205 --> 00:03.622
Slate is clean. Okay?

00:03.623 --> 00:04.873
You owe me nothing.

00:06.125 --> 00:07.543
Are you fuckin' serious?

00:10.040 --> 00:11.769
This piece that I'm doing for class,

00:11.770 --> 00:14.173
it's not a character. It's me.
What if I get it wrong?

00:14.174 --> 00:15.593
The whole place is yours.

00:16.000 --> 00:17.010
Wow.

00:17.011 --> 00:18.679
Hey, guys, since we're all about to die,

00:18.680 --> 00:20.055
I have to be honest about something.

00:20.056 --> 00:21.790
I'm nice. Polite.

00:21.800 --> 00:24.560
I'm optometrist by nature.

00:24.561 --> 00:27.020
Guys. Is this about what I said on bus?

00:27.021 --> 00:29.399
Because... I was delegating.

00:30.040 --> 00:31.440
I'm headed up to my cabin.

00:31.442 --> 00:33.520
This private detective approached me.

00:33.529 --> 00:34.988
- Barry.
- Ah.

00:35.440 --> 00:37.459
My name is Gene Cousineau.

00:37.460 --> 00:40.240
I killed Detective Janice Moss.

02:45.660 --> 02:47.450
Sit down.

02:50.237 --> 02:52.120
Sit down!

03:03.678 --> 03:06.179
So, you talked to this Goulet character?

03:06.180 --> 03:07.980
Yes.

03:07.987 --> 03:09.520
And while you were in the woods,

03:09.529 --> 03:12.530
you heard the sirens that
brought you to the car?

03:13.660 --> 03:14.860
Yes.

03:14.862 --> 03:16.619
The car that we couldn't find

03:16.620 --> 03:19.450
even after scouring the
woods for a month?

03:20.320 --> 03:21.946
Is Mr. Cousineau okay?

03:25.153 --> 03:27.259
You know what I thought
the first time I met you?

03:27.260 --> 03:31.270
I thought, wow, this Barry guy
really cares about his teacher.

03:31.279 --> 03:33.832
You were almost... protective of him.

03:33.833 --> 03:35.610
We're not making this Goulet guy up.

03:35.612 --> 03:37.400
I want to believe you.

03:37.404 --> 03:39.759
Because lying to a police
officer during an investigation

03:39.760 --> 03:41.170
is a crime.

03:41.174 --> 03:44.879
But... there's no evidence to suggest

03:44.880 --> 03:47.760
that anyone was up in the woods
with you other than your teacher.

03:55.571 --> 03:58.191
Okay. You're free to go.

03:59.279 --> 04:00.859
Can I see Mr. Cousineau?

04:00.860 --> 04:03.119
Oh, no. We think he
killed his girlfriend,

04:03.120 --> 04:05.450
so he's staying here with us.

04:19.195 --> 04:21.619
Yeah, you've reached Comtel Industries.

04:21.620 --> 04:23.499
Why don't you go ahead
and leave a message.

04:24.654 --> 04:26.510
Fuches...

04:26.511 --> 04:28.730
I'm coming for you.

04:28.737 --> 04:30.700
You're a fucking dead man.

04:33.440 --> 04:37.719
I would like to welcome you
guys to your new home!

04:37.720 --> 04:40.690
Which I got for you. You're welcome.

04:40.696 --> 04:43.019
Oh, this place is great, isn't it?

04:43.020 --> 04:45.860
It's like Enter Dragon. Am I right?

04:45.862 --> 04:48.020
Wow, need to get rid of this, though.

04:48.028 --> 04:50.860
I mean, what an eyesore.
What is that for even?

04:50.862 --> 04:54.719
Anyway, heroin gets here
in T-minus five hours.

04:54.720 --> 04:57.660
So, we're... Guys?

04:59.821 --> 05:01.319
Hey! Know what we need?

05:01.320 --> 05:04.650
Um, table to put the heroin on.

05:04.654 --> 05:06.519
Fuck, that is such a great idea.

05:06.520 --> 05:09.239
I'm going to buy one, put it right here.

05:09.240 --> 05:11.972
Heroin table, that's got
to be a thing, right?

05:11.973 --> 05:14.019
So, I'm on your website right now.

05:14.020 --> 05:15.520
Beautiful furniture, by the way.

05:15.529 --> 05:17.689
And I'm seeing dining room tables,

05:17.690 --> 05:19.299
I'm seeing coffee tables,

05:19.300 --> 05:22.940
but not sure how to look
for the table that I need.

05:22.945 --> 05:24.480
No, it's for heroin.

05:24.487 --> 05:26.520
About 30 kilos, give or take.

05:26.529 --> 05:29.359
What I'm thinking is
carved wood, stone top.

05:29.360 --> 05:30.679
Marble maybe.

05:30.680 --> 05:32.359
What I'm dealing with
is an open floor plan,

05:32.360 --> 05:34.699
so it really needs to
work on its own merit.

05:34.700 --> 05:36.480
I'm sorry. Can you hang on one minute?

05:36.487 --> 05:37.699
Thank you.

05:37.700 --> 05:39.799
This is NoHo Hank.

05:39.800 --> 05:43.080
It's Batir. I just landed.

05:44.654 --> 05:47.069
Batir, uh...

05:47.070 --> 05:49.419
you're here in California?

05:49.420 --> 05:51.052
I've come to replace you, Hank.

05:51.053 --> 05:53.240
You're going home to Chechnya.

05:54.404 --> 05:56.099
Is this open for discussion?

05:56.100 --> 05:58.199
No. I am at Ontario Airport.

05:58.200 --> 06:00.019
I am taking Super Shuttle to monastery.

06:00.020 --> 06:01.679
They promised to drop me first.

06:01.680 --> 06:04.690
They say 30 minutes.

06:04.692 --> 06:06.479
My guys are fortifying this monastery

06:06.480 --> 06:08.059
for when Bolivians and Burmese show up

06:08.060 --> 06:09.439
to have massive firefight.

06:09.440 --> 06:11.839
I don't even have time
to order heroin table,

06:11.840 --> 06:14.199
which is a thing on Pinterest
but not on Amazon.

06:14.200 --> 06:15.759
And now, Batir is coming.

06:15.760 --> 06:17.419
I mean, he's coming from Ontario,

06:17.420 --> 06:18.679
so it'll take him like nine hours...

06:18.680 --> 06:20.359
I can't have this
conversation anymore, Hank.

06:20.360 --> 06:22.480
My guys, they'll listen to you.

06:22.487 --> 06:26.599
I need you to tell them that I am
to be trusted. I'm losing them!

06:26.600 --> 06:28.409
There is suspiciously low level

06:28.410 --> 06:29.820
of eye contact going on.

06:29.821 --> 06:32.230
Uh, tell them I am
best leader, you know.

06:32.237 --> 06:34.370
We arm wrestle, maybe...

06:39.696 --> 06:42.519
- How was your audition?
- Oh. Uh, it was fine...

06:42.520 --> 06:44.270
I'm really just asking.
I don't need an answer.

06:44.273 --> 06:46.120
Come on, we're in the middle of tech.

06:48.153 --> 06:51.071
Wait. What is this place?

06:51.072 --> 06:52.439
Do you have any idea where Gene is?

06:52.440 --> 06:53.690
No one can get a hold of him.

06:53.696 --> 06:55.650
Oh, he's at his cabin, I think.

06:55.654 --> 06:57.799
He-He'll be here. Whoa.

06:57.800 --> 06:59.539
Okay, actors, if you're
not in this scene,

06:59.540 --> 07:00.890
just take a seat in the house.

07:00.900 --> 07:02.190
Look at all the seats.

07:02.195 --> 07:03.899
Yeah, Lindsay sold out the whole place.

07:03.900 --> 07:05.639
She told people it was a
"diversity showcase,"

07:05.640 --> 07:07.619
and I think they were
afraid not to RSVP.

07:07.620 --> 07:09.099
Okay, everyone,

07:09.100 --> 07:11.920
let's take it from the
bottom of Jermaine's speech.

07:11.926 --> 07:13.551
Here we go, everyone. Here we go.

07:13.552 --> 07:16.279
Yeah, I know. I'm going to set it there.

07:16.280 --> 07:17.319
- Thank you.
- Shh! Shh!

07:17.320 --> 07:20.892
My dad was my hero, and
then he disappeared.

07:20.893 --> 07:23.399
My ma used to tell me that the
reason I never saw him again

07:23.400 --> 07:25.359
was because he got abducted by aliens.

07:25.360 --> 07:27.639
I actually believed that

07:27.640 --> 07:29.199
till the day I saw him strung out,

07:29.200 --> 07:31.320
begging for money, outside
of a liquor store.

07:32.404 --> 07:34.490
He didn't recognize me.

07:37.487 --> 07:39.690
That's crazy, uh...

07:39.696 --> 07:41.339
Uh, so I gave him some money

07:41.340 --> 07:43.399
and never saw him again.

07:43.400 --> 07:45.579
I don't know if he's dead or alive,

07:45.580 --> 07:47.739
but I just hope he
knows, wherever he is,

07:47.740 --> 07:50.190
that he's still my hero.

07:50.195 --> 07:52.270
Not even aliens could
take that away from me.

07:53.529 --> 07:55.759
- That's beautiful, powerful.
- Woo!

07:55.760 --> 07:57.299
Great job. Okay, we got that.

07:57.300 --> 07:58.900
Let's move on to Nick.

07:58.903 --> 08:00.306
Sasha, strike that.

08:00.307 --> 08:03.101
Look, Barry, I was nervous too, okay?

08:03.102 --> 08:05.119
But everybody's dropped the
competitive grief bullshit,

08:05.120 --> 08:07.730
and they're delivering
honest and real work.

08:07.732 --> 08:09.774
I mean, look what we inspired!

08:09.775 --> 08:12.569
Nick, your vomit scene is up next.

08:12.570 --> 08:14.904
Jesus, this place has a balcony.

08:14.905 --> 08:17.480
Yes, there's a lot of
fucking seats! Move on!

08:17.487 --> 08:19.020
Doors open in two hours,

08:19.028 --> 08:20.860
I think we should start rehearsing.

08:20.862 --> 08:22.979
Louder, Nick, louder.

08:22.980 --> 08:25.569
Okay, okay. Sorry, sorry.

08:25.570 --> 08:27.610
We can't find this guy.

08:27.612 --> 08:31.179
But we have a recording of a 911 call

08:31.180 --> 08:34.690
where you confess to Moss's
murder and threaten suicide.

08:34.696 --> 08:36.440
It wasn't me.

08:36.445 --> 08:38.520
But the call came from your phone,

08:38.529 --> 08:40.597
and it sounds like you.

08:41.903 --> 08:43.517
Mr. Cousineau, can you look at me?

08:46.640 --> 08:50.190
Mm. You're in a bad place.

08:50.195 --> 08:52.610
The guilt and remorse
is weighing on you.

08:52.612 --> 08:53.943
I get it.

08:53.944 --> 08:56.520
You know what I think?

08:56.529 --> 08:59.610
I think you called your student,
Barry, to talk you out of it.

08:59.612 --> 09:01.619
'Cause you didn't want
to go through with it.

09:03.112 --> 09:04.662
Barry spoke to him.

09:04.663 --> 09:07.319
I don't want to hear
about this Goulet guy.

09:07.320 --> 09:08.875
He doesn't exist.

09:08.876 --> 09:10.820
What happened?

09:28.640 --> 09:31.640
Gene, it's okay.

09:31.650 --> 09:33.690
It's okay.

09:33.696 --> 09:35.149
Did you fight?

09:35.150 --> 09:36.579
Did she threaten to leave you

09:36.580 --> 09:38.439
and you couldn't handle the rejection?

09:38.440 --> 09:40.740
She was the love of my life.

09:46.529 --> 09:48.990
Mr. Cousineau, please stand up.

09:50.860 --> 09:53.719
You're under arrest for the
murder of Janice Moss.

09:53.720 --> 09:56.820
We'll arrange for a transport
for you back to Los Angeles.

09:56.821 --> 09:58.499
You'll be taken to a holding cell,

09:58.500 --> 10:00.980
and you'll be given one phone call.

10:00.987 --> 10:02.319
Stand up, please.

10:49.720 --> 10:51.480
Impressive.

10:51.487 --> 10:53.521
Looks like you got yourself an army.

10:53.522 --> 10:55.479
Fuches?

10:55.480 --> 10:58.818
And I need an army.

11:04.654 --> 11:06.400
San Bernardino Sheriff's Department.

11:06.404 --> 11:07.730
Deputy Wilson speaking.

11:07.737 --> 11:10.109
Hi. Yeah, this is, uh, Barry Berkman.

11:10.110 --> 11:12.479
- Yeah?
- Uh, you said I could call you,

11:12.480 --> 11:15.069
uh, with any updates on Mr. Cousineau.

11:15.070 --> 11:17.939
I said I'd call you with any updates.

11:17.940 --> 11:21.119
Okay, guys, this show
starts in two minutes.

11:21.120 --> 11:24.139
- Well, how's he doing?
- They just booked him.

11:24.140 --> 11:26.079
You can try to see him
in LA County tomorrow.

11:26.080 --> 11:28.570
- They are moving him tonight.
- They... they booked him?

11:28.571 --> 11:29.650
Yeah.

11:29.654 --> 11:32.185
Well, is-is, uh... is he okay?

11:32.186 --> 11:34.370
See him tomorrow, Berkman.

11:35.445 --> 11:38.620
Copy that. We'll get on it.

11:57.878 --> 11:59.570
Yeah, I think "fraught" is maybe
the word I'm looking for.

11:59.571 --> 12:01.479
Yeah, that's not what I'm trying... Oh!

12:01.480 --> 12:04.269
- Just, I got to... Yeah.
- Oh, please.

12:08.862 --> 12:11.141
- Hey, bud!
- Fuck you!

12:11.142 --> 12:14.159
You know...

12:14.160 --> 12:17.063
you could save your little acting
teacher. You know that, right?

12:17.064 --> 12:19.360
I'm going to fucking kill you, Fuches.

12:19.362 --> 12:21.860
All you have to do is turn yourself in.

12:21.862 --> 12:23.569
Give it all up for him.

12:23.570 --> 12:25.150
Yeah?

12:25.153 --> 12:28.230
Not so altruistic now,
are you, motherfucker?

12:28.237 --> 12:31.577
Now who's out of moves? Buh-bye.

12:33.150 --> 12:34.999
Hey, everybody,
bring it in. Bring it in.

12:35.000 --> 12:36.520
Woo!

12:36.529 --> 12:37.820
And...

12:37.821 --> 12:41.004
Go... Cousineau!

12:43.549 --> 12:45.279
All right, places everyone.
Places, places.

12:45.280 --> 12:46.800
- Showtime! Hey.
- Hi! Hi.

12:46.802 --> 12:48.511
Showtime. Yeah. You feelin' good?

12:48.512 --> 12:50.399
- Yeah. Yeah. I think so. Yeah.
- Good. Yeah.

12:50.400 --> 12:52.479
So everyone showed. The
audience is packed.

12:52.480 --> 12:54.639
Everyone is here. Oh,
the Mikes are here.

12:54.640 --> 12:56.390
Oh, so they got on board with
the whole showcase idea?

12:56.395 --> 12:58.570
Oh, yeah, they're in, but...

12:58.571 --> 12:59.770
They don't know. They're...

12:59.779 --> 13:01.650
They're as on board as they'll ever be.

13:01.654 --> 13:03.069
Which is pretty on board.

13:03.070 --> 13:04.859
- I'm not... I mean, you know...
- No pressure.

13:04.860 --> 13:07.160
No pressure, exactly.
It's going to be...

13:08.612 --> 13:10.533
So, um...

13:10.534 --> 13:12.578
You feel good that we're
doing this, though, right?

13:12.579 --> 13:13.579
Oh, me?

13:13.580 --> 13:14.939
I feel great that we're doing this!

13:14.940 --> 13:17.519
I feel so good, because,
at the end of the day,

13:17.520 --> 13:19.119
you are telling your story.

13:19.120 --> 13:21.099
You're the artist. I'm
supporting the artist.

13:21.100 --> 13:23.570
I brought all these people here
because this is what you want to do.

13:23.571 --> 13:26.319
And you're going to be
great, and I believe in you.

13:26.320 --> 13:28.399
Which is why we started
this whole frickin' thing.

13:28.400 --> 13:30.699
So, I'm excited. You're excited.

13:30.700 --> 13:32.972
You're going to be great, and
break a frickin' leg, Sally.

13:32.973 --> 13:34.690
Okay, see you later.

13:34.696 --> 13:37.935
Nick, Nick, you're up, let's go.

13:37.936 --> 13:39.769
This is not what her contract
was supposed to say.

13:39.770 --> 13:40.779
These aren't the right details.

13:40.780 --> 13:42.879
Sally's is last, so you guys are
going to have to be patient.

13:42.880 --> 13:43.901
- But...
- Oh, great.

13:43.902 --> 13:46.560
Shh! Shh! Shh!

13:54.180 --> 13:56.030
You know what was in the toilet?

13:57.279 --> 13:59.150
It wasn't the vomit,

13:59.153 --> 14:03.002
or the three-day old pizza I
poured bleach on and still ate,

14:03.003 --> 14:06.240
or even my made-up stomach issue.

14:07.330 --> 14:08.424
It was me.

14:08.425 --> 14:11.135
It was me!

14:11.136 --> 14:13.020
Forgotten.

14:13.028 --> 14:14.610
Remembered.

14:14.612 --> 14:16.641
Forgotten.

14:16.642 --> 14:19.610
I was the youngest of four gotten.

14:19.612 --> 14:20.940
Forgotten.

14:20.945 --> 14:25.730
Four got ten, nine, eight, seven, six!

14:25.737 --> 14:29.689
Was the age when I was
left at a garage sale.

14:29.690 --> 14:31.499
I mean, Jesus, Hank. They're
all headed here now?

14:31.500 --> 14:32.519
Yes.

14:32.520 --> 14:35.360
What I need more than
anything right now is Barry.

14:35.362 --> 14:37.939
He is like crazy Chechen goon-whisperer.

14:37.940 --> 14:39.179
That might be a bit tricky, Hank.

14:39.180 --> 14:40.940
We had a minor falling out.

14:40.945 --> 14:44.859
Oh, come on, you guys
are like Fleetwood Mac.

14:44.860 --> 14:47.059
You break up, you get
back together again,

14:47.060 --> 14:48.689
and then you go out and
make a great album,

14:48.690 --> 14:49.841
like The Best of Fleetwood Mac.

14:49.842 --> 14:51.939
This may be more final than that.

14:51.940 --> 14:54.300
Which is why I need your
guys to get my back, yes?

14:54.304 --> 14:58.069
Yeah, well, day late and
ruble short, I'm afraid.

14:58.070 --> 14:59.770
They won't listen to me, man.

14:59.779 --> 15:01.727
But they will listen to Barry.

15:01.728 --> 15:03.879
Barry? Come on. I'm the
guy that made Barry!

15:03.880 --> 15:04.980
They'll listen to me.

15:04.982 --> 15:06.819
Hey, fellas! Come back here.

15:06.820 --> 15:08.780
Guys. Guys!

15:19.362 --> 15:20.581
Shit.

15:34.487 --> 15:36.190
Also, I was thinking that...

15:36.195 --> 15:37.549
Fuches?

15:37.550 --> 15:39.599
Okay, guys, we're going
to be in a war now.

15:39.600 --> 15:41.143
- I'm so excited for you guys!
- Hello!

15:42.720 --> 15:46.069
You know, seems like you brought

15:46.070 --> 15:51.229
a lot of people and guns

15:51.230 --> 15:54.059
for a talk with friends.

15:54.060 --> 15:56.269
Who is this?

15:56.270 --> 15:57.779
Viejito loco.

15:57.780 --> 15:59.911
Yes. Muy triste.

16:04.195 --> 16:06.709
Is... Is he talking to us?

16:06.710 --> 16:09.360
No, maybe... No, he's on the Bluetooth.

16:09.362 --> 16:11.297
I can't... Is he on the Bluetooth?

16:11.298 --> 16:13.341
Cristobal, buddy, wow!

16:13.342 --> 16:17.150
Oh. Okay. I hear my name.
He is talking to us.

16:17.153 --> 16:18.690
_

16:18.696 --> 16:20.181
I can't watch.

16:20.182 --> 16:23.601
Cristobal. Esther. Nice to meet you.

16:23.602 --> 16:26.312
You know, in America
Esther's a woman's name.

16:28.153 --> 16:30.069
Who the fuck are you?

16:30.070 --> 16:31.940
Fuches. Monroe Fuches.

16:31.945 --> 16:34.700
I'm, uh, Hank's representative.

16:37.153 --> 16:38.570
Let's get to it.

16:38.571 --> 16:41.035
You came here to kill us.

16:41.036 --> 16:44.069
Okay. Murder.

16:44.070 --> 16:48.459
I used to think people like
you were the shit, man.

16:48.460 --> 16:53.047
Bad-asses like yourself
always fascinated me.

16:53.048 --> 16:55.179
But-But doing it, you know,

16:55.180 --> 16:59.980
actually pulling the
trigger, ending a life...

16:59.987 --> 17:03.099
Well, that takes someone with no soul.

17:03.100 --> 17:05.810
Hank tried to criss-cross me.

17:05.810 --> 17:11.690
You and Hank, you're in a...
transitional phase, that's all.

17:11.695 --> 17:15.359
You know, people meet and sometimes...

17:15.362 --> 17:17.940
they lock into each other

17:17.944 --> 17:21.740
like two long-sought-after
pieces of a puzzle.

17:23.099 --> 17:24.878
Now, as time goes on,

17:24.880 --> 17:28.119
these pieces, they morph
and they-they grow.

17:29.445 --> 17:33.539
And they can grow together
and become stronger.

17:33.540 --> 17:35.880
Or...

17:36.654 --> 17:41.690
they can become two completely
different shapes that...

17:41.696 --> 17:44.600
they don't have any room for each
other, they don't fit anymore.

17:45.260 --> 17:48.110
If there's one thing
I've learned in my life,

17:48.112 --> 17:53.150
you can't control what other
people are going to do.

17:53.153 --> 17:54.730
No. No.

17:54.737 --> 17:57.020
They need their own space to...

17:57.028 --> 18:00.780
become whatever weird-ass shape
they're going to change into.

18:02.320 --> 18:06.940
It's nature. You can't
control it, but...

18:06.945 --> 18:08.650
you can accept it.

18:08.654 --> 18:11.319
And I think, you know,

18:11.320 --> 18:14.490
you and Hank, that's still a fit, man.

18:20.340 --> 18:22.899
- I'm so sorry, man.
- Are you kidding me?

18:22.900 --> 18:25.650
Are you kidding me? I tried
to screw you over, man.

18:25.654 --> 18:27.619
No, you only tried to kill Esther

18:27.620 --> 18:29.650
because you cared about me.

18:29.654 --> 18:31.539
Look, I love you, okay?

18:31.540 --> 18:33.190
Can we just say that once and for all?

18:33.195 --> 18:34.519
Look, I love you, man.

18:34.520 --> 18:35.859
And I just think,

18:35.860 --> 18:39.919
with the heroin shipment coming
in and everything, you know...

18:39.920 --> 18:41.980
... we're sitting on a gold mine!

18:45.862 --> 18:49.239
Te amo, mi corazón. My little papita.

18:49.240 --> 18:50.570
Jesus Christ, easy, easy.

18:50.571 --> 18:51.899
You guys are like my cats.

18:51.900 --> 18:53.520
I have to pour water on you.

18:53.529 --> 18:55.239
Come on! Let's celebrate.

18:55.240 --> 18:57.610
We can send somebody to
Ralph's, get sandwiches.

18:57.612 --> 19:00.399
And, you know, case of Rolling
Rock, let's do it up!

19:07.641 --> 19:09.459
Ugh, I'm sweating.

19:09.460 --> 19:12.470
All right, you guys clearly
don't get this so, to recap:

19:12.479 --> 19:14.150
This...

19:14.153 --> 19:16.440
was walking down this...

19:16.445 --> 19:18.400
and it was seen by her.

19:18.404 --> 19:21.379
Not... not actually her.
This is not a photo of me.

19:21.380 --> 19:23.079
I don't have any photos of
myself from my childhood

19:23.080 --> 19:24.089
because my uncle burnt down my house

19:24.090 --> 19:25.490
when my mum was still
inside, but that's...

19:25.492 --> 19:28.285
that is not relevant
to this story, is it?

19:28.286 --> 19:31.279
Okay, Lindsay seems really nervous.

19:31.280 --> 19:33.239
What if the scene doesn't work?

19:33.240 --> 19:36.299
Telling the truth is the
right thing to do, right?

19:36.300 --> 19:37.730
Barry?

19:37.737 --> 19:41.110
Telling the truth is the
right thing to do, right?

19:41.112 --> 19:42.758
Barry!

19:42.759 --> 19:44.900
Oh, my God, are you okay?

19:44.903 --> 19:47.980
Okay, it's time, guys.

19:47.987 --> 19:50.270
Break legs.

19:52.404 --> 19:54.120
Fuck.

19:56.237 --> 19:58.570
Hey, Barry, are you okay?

19:58.571 --> 20:01.440
Come on. Are you okay?

20:01.445 --> 20:03.770
Fuck!

20:03.779 --> 20:06.479
Barry, it's a good idea
we're doing this, right?

20:06.480 --> 20:07.519
Jer-Jermaine.

20:07.520 --> 20:09.139
- I am Jermaine.
- You don't think this is a mistake?

20:09.140 --> 20:10.420
Give me that back.

20:12.038 --> 20:13.956
Just try to breathe.

20:18.360 --> 20:19.639
It's not horses.

20:19.640 --> 20:21.339
It's just that I love their magical...

20:21.340 --> 20:23.159
Hey, where are you at right now?

20:23.160 --> 20:24.719
- I need you present.
- I am present.

20:24.720 --> 20:26.679
No, come on. Come on. Focus.

20:26.680 --> 20:28.270
Come on, focus. Look at me.

20:28.279 --> 20:31.299
Let's just, let's practice
the choke, ready?

20:31.300 --> 20:32.799
- What?
- The choke. Ready? One...

20:32.800 --> 20:34.110
one, two, three.

20:34.112 --> 20:37.730
- Come on, Barry, sell it!
- I am selling it.

20:50.240 --> 20:53.120
Stay in that place.

20:53.121 --> 20:55.409
Thank you.

20:55.410 --> 20:57.079
Oh, wait, I'm going to take
that. I'm going to take that.

20:57.080 --> 20:59.250
I'm going to take that
for my house. Love that!

20:59.252 --> 21:00.870
Oh, killed it.

21:20.940 --> 21:23.260
It was...

21:24.190 --> 21:27.779
It was a typical November night.

21:27.780 --> 21:29.520
It was cold outside.

21:29.529 --> 21:31.990
And he had been drinking.

21:43.830 --> 21:45.670
Who was that guy you were
dancing with tonight?

21:47.571 --> 21:49.069
Ken?

21:49.070 --> 21:52.096
Well, he's just a friend, Sam.

21:52.097 --> 21:53.319
I didn't like it. It was embarrassing.

21:53.320 --> 21:54.640
You looked like a fuckin' whore.

21:54.641 --> 21:57.480
Come on, Sam.

21:57.487 --> 21:59.688
Don't... Don't be an idiot.

22:00.696 --> 22:04.410
Don't fucking call me an idiot!

22:06.528 --> 22:08.863
I'll call you a fucking idiot!

22:08.864 --> 22:10.399
Yeah, and you know what else?

22:10.400 --> 22:11.949
I'll talk to who I please,

22:11.950 --> 22:14.229
when I please. You don't
own me, you fucking prick!

22:14.230 --> 22:16.779
And from now on, I'm
going to speak my mind.

22:16.780 --> 22:18.639
I'll say what I want to
say, starting with this:

22:18.640 --> 22:20.479
My name is Sally Jane
Reed, and, as of today,

22:20.480 --> 22:23.500
we are fucking done, you son of a bitch!

22:35.404 --> 22:37.601
Shit...

22:46.151 --> 22:49.240
And that's our show...

22:50.445 --> 22:52.440
Sally. Hey. Hey, hey! Where you going?

22:52.445 --> 22:53.860
- What's going on?
- I got to get out of here.

22:53.862 --> 22:55.617
It's fine! No. Tell me...
tell me what happened.

22:55.618 --> 22:57.139
I just, I don't know. I
saw all those people,

22:57.140 --> 22:58.454
and I just... I kind of panicked.

22:58.455 --> 23:01.039
So, I got up there and I... I lied.

23:01.040 --> 23:03.779
I actually lied. I'm not an artist.

23:03.780 --> 23:04.940
You should go in there. You should be...

23:04.945 --> 23:06.480
That's a different kind of truth.

23:06.487 --> 23:09.359
I was kind of forcing you to
expose in front of everyone.

23:09.360 --> 23:11.109
Sally, I just really want to apologize,

23:11.110 --> 23:12.669
because I feel very bad

23:12.670 --> 23:13.699
- about this situation.
- No, no...

23:13.700 --> 23:15.970
And I should not have put
you in that position.

23:15.972 --> 23:19.059
You should never have had to do
something so incredibly vulnerable

23:19.060 --> 23:20.069
in front of so many people

23:20.070 --> 23:23.619
- with so little time. That's not fair.
- Sally. So that was not at all

23:23.620 --> 23:24.879
what I thought you were going to do.

23:24.880 --> 23:28.039
And now we know why you hated
Aaron Ryan's story so much.

23:28.040 --> 23:30.039
His story was dark and
gritty and, frankly,

23:30.040 --> 23:32.440
kind of a bummer about women who get
trapped in a hopeless existence.

23:32.445 --> 23:34.549
But yours was full of
hope and redemption

23:34.550 --> 23:35.900
about a woman taking charge of her life.

23:35.903 --> 23:37.360
Really inspiring.

23:37.362 --> 23:39.270
And not like those other
stories which were a bummer.

23:39.279 --> 23:40.649
I liked the one about the horse.

23:40.650 --> 23:42.339
And the way you did that speech.

23:42.340 --> 23:44.159
- It was like...
- Braveheart.

23:44.160 --> 23:45.919
- Braveheart, exactly.
- Look this is exactly

23:45.920 --> 23:47.400
the kind of fucking shit I...

23:47.404 --> 23:48.963
Excuse me, Ms. Reed?

23:48.964 --> 23:52.059
My husband and I thought
you were amazing.

23:52.060 --> 23:55.690
There she is. That was breathtaking.

23:55.696 --> 23:57.799
I have a friend who went
through a similar situation.

23:57.800 --> 23:59.930
She did not have the courage
to do what you just did.

23:59.933 --> 24:01.919
Truly inspiring.

24:01.920 --> 24:04.930
- She was crying.
- I was crying. I was really crying.

24:15.270 --> 24:17.099
Your ride back to LA is here.

24:17.100 --> 24:19.703
You'll meet your lawyer and
be arraigned in Los Angeles.

24:20.570 --> 24:21.610
Hold on.

24:21.612 --> 24:24.332
Mae, you need to come in here.

24:25.862 --> 24:27.700
Excuse me.

24:48.980 --> 24:51.568
Okay, Mr. Cousineau.

24:52.320 --> 24:54.730
Mr. Cousineau?

24:54.737 --> 24:56.698
You're free to go.

24:58.020 --> 25:00.160
He's free to go.

25:18.053 --> 25:19.819
This is Officer Chad Wilson

25:19.820 --> 25:21.019
of the San Bernardino
Sheriff's Department...

25:21.020 --> 25:22.430
Fuck!

25:43.470 --> 25:44.621
Hello?

25:45.520 --> 25:47.570
Hello?

25:47.571 --> 25:50.020
Uh, is Mr. Cousineau there?

25:50.028 --> 25:52.319
Uh, who is this?

25:52.320 --> 25:54.450
Uh, this is Barry Block.

25:55.420 --> 25:56.610
Who's this?

25:56.612 --> 25:59.270
I'm... I'm Leo.

25:59.279 --> 26:01.096
I'm his... his son.

26:02.520 --> 26:05.190
Hi, um, is he okay?

26:05.195 --> 26:06.610
Have they taken him to LA yet?

26:06.612 --> 26:08.299
No, actually, they're letting him go.

26:08.300 --> 26:09.520
I just got here, so...

26:09.521 --> 26:12.773
They're letting him go? What happened?

26:12.774 --> 26:16.480
I... I guess they found this
thing in Janice's trunk.

26:16.487 --> 26:18.237
It's a Chechen pin.

26:18.238 --> 26:20.820
So this translates to
"The debt has been paid"?

26:20.821 --> 26:22.533
That's what our guy is telling us.

26:22.534 --> 26:25.280
They must have left it there as a
message for when we found her.

26:26.279 --> 26:27.859
Chechens did this.

26:39.903 --> 26:41.969
Oh, good, uh...

26:41.970 --> 26:44.269
Can you keep in contact with me?

26:44.270 --> 26:45.900
Just to let me know he's okay?

26:45.903 --> 26:48.150
Uh, sure, I...

26:48.153 --> 26:49.939
Barry Block? Is that what you said?

26:49.940 --> 26:52.660
It's Berkman.

26:53.487 --> 26:55.650
My name's Barry Berkman.

26:55.654 --> 26:57.980
Okay, yeah, I'll let you know.

26:57.987 --> 27:00.559
Well, and... and can you tell
your dad something for me?

27:00.560 --> 27:03.609
Uh, sure.

27:03.610 --> 27:08.039
Can you tell him that he's going
to be okay and that, uh...

27:08.040 --> 27:10.320
and that he was right?

27:11.362 --> 27:13.917
I'm pretty sure that people can change.

27:13.918 --> 27:16.019
Okay. Will do.

27:38.120 --> 27:41.444
_

27:43.860 --> 27:47.202
_

28:37.740 --> 28:40.120
White boy. Lululemon track suit.

28:45.279 --> 28:47.549
Barry?

28:47.550 --> 28:48.610
Shit!

28:53.643 --> 28:55.519
- Fuches!
- No!

29:15.654 --> 29:18.319
- ¡Mátalo, mátalo!
- ¡Mátenlo, mátenlo!

29:24.640 --> 29:26.460
Fuches!

29:26.467 --> 29:28.139
Oh, shit! Shit!

29:28.140 --> 29:30.069
Aw, fuck!

29:32.400 --> 29:33.820
Guys! Let me in!

29:36.480 --> 29:39.340
Ow! Yes!

29:40.070 --> 29:41.870
Help me!

29:42.945 --> 29:44.459
Oh! You, you.

29:44.460 --> 29:46.619
Hide me, he's trying to kill
me. He's trying to kill me!

29:46.620 --> 29:47.899
I'll tell you what, I'll
give you anything you want!

29:47.900 --> 29:49.019
Just get me the fuck out of here!

29:49.020 --> 29:50.679
- Vlad, Barry's mentor.
- Get me the fuck out of here.

29:50.680 --> 29:52.860
- His mentor?
- Get me out. Get me out.

29:56.020 --> 29:57.999
Barry's mentor!

30:15.571 --> 30:17.579
Hey! Hide him in there?

30:17.580 --> 30:19.559
Is he in there? Is he in there? Hey!

30:19.560 --> 30:21.759
Motherfuck... Motherfuckin' door!

30:23.070 --> 30:25.570
Fucking...

30:31.657 --> 30:34.786
Where is he? Where is he!

30:49.737 --> 30:50.919
Fuches!

30:50.920 --> 30:52.659
Fuches, you fuck!

30:58.960 --> 31:00.260
Fuches!

31:17.696 --> 31:19.538
Fuches!

31:30.529 --> 31:32.069
Fuck!

32:23.144 --> 32:24.950
Hey, Batir!

32:26.147 --> 32:28.320
Hey, man!

33:27.195 --> 33:29.780
You, um, you want some tea, Dad?

33:31.945 --> 33:33.230
Um...

34:28.811 --> 34:31.188
Barry Berkman did this.

34:32.610 --> 34:35.509
Oh, my God!

34:35.510 --> 34:40.510

35:53.230 --> 35:54.799
- Hey, bud.
- Fuck you.

35:54.800 --> 35:57.607
You could save your little acting
teacher. You know that, right?

35:57.608 --> 35:59.693
I'm gonna fucking kill you, Fuches.

35:59.694 --> 36:00.985
Give it all up for him.

36:00.986 --> 36:03.440
Not so altruistic now,
are you, motherfucker?

36:03.445 --> 36:06.116
Now who's out of moves? Buh-bye.

36:07.993 --> 36:10.230
The culmination of like
everything that happened

36:10.237 --> 36:13.498
this season is kinda paying
off, and Barry has that moment

36:13.499 --> 36:15.759
where he gets there, and he...
you know, does he chase Fuches,

36:15.760 --> 36:17.370
or does he help Cousineau?

36:17.378 --> 36:18.753
He chooses to help Cousineau,

36:18.754 --> 36:20.719
but his anger is at Fuches is so real.

36:20.720 --> 36:21.729
I'm coming for you.

36:21.730 --> 36:24.384
That's this kind of anger that
he talks about all season.

36:24.385 --> 36:27.596
Can he control this demon,
or is it just who he is?

36:29.430 --> 36:31.679
We wanted to get this
feeling of Cousineau,

36:31.680 --> 36:34.102
he's gonna go to jail for her murder.

36:34.103 --> 36:35.563
Can I see Mr. Cousineau?

36:36.028 --> 36:37.679
Oh, no, we think he
killed his girlfriend,

36:37.680 --> 36:39.439
so he's staying here with us.

36:39.440 --> 36:42.499
The class is celebrating
this thing of truth,

36:42.500 --> 36:45.099
and then, their leader
is gonna go to jail

36:45.100 --> 36:47.099
because of Barry, so
it's just good to be

36:47.100 --> 36:49.039
just ratcheting that
tension up for Barry

36:49.040 --> 36:50.360
and the shame and the guilt

36:50.362 --> 36:52.279
and the anger, and just
getting that all...

36:52.280 --> 36:54.620
just him wound as tight as possible.

36:54.623 --> 36:55.957
Fuches!

36:55.958 --> 36:59.293
I think that Sarah Goldberg does
a great job in this episode.

36:59.294 --> 37:01.299
I love the scene at the
end of this episode

37:01.300 --> 37:03.859
with her and Jessie Hodges in the lobby

37:03.860 --> 37:05.400
when people are coming around them.

37:05.404 --> 37:06.885
Sally realizing that,

37:06.886 --> 37:09.820
like, "I've wanted to be an artist
and I couldn't be an artist,"

37:09.821 --> 37:11.679
and that the industry and the Mikes

37:11.680 --> 37:13.399
and these people she's
trying to impress, they go,

37:13.400 --> 37:14.889
"No, that's not what we want."

37:14.890 --> 37:16.119
Well, and that'll be a question,

37:16.120 --> 37:17.129
- I think, going forward, right?
- Yeah.

37:17.130 --> 37:20.219
Like how much is she gonna
just give in to the success

37:20.220 --> 37:21.679
and much is she gonna fight it?

37:21.680 --> 37:23.985
That was breathtaking.

37:23.986 --> 37:25.959
We also love Henry in this episode.

37:25.960 --> 37:27.839
And then, him and Leo
coming back together.

37:27.840 --> 37:29.490
He's trying to keep it together.

37:29.492 --> 37:31.039
Cousineau being with his real son,

37:31.040 --> 37:33.980
and I love that Leo and Barry
talk to each other at the end,

37:33.987 --> 37:35.330
I think, is really nice.

37:35.331 --> 37:37.290
Can you... Can you tell
your dad something for me?

37:37.291 --> 37:39.250
Uh, sure.

37:39.251 --> 37:40.679
Can you tell him he's gonna be okay,

37:40.680 --> 37:42.000
and that, um, he was right.

37:42.004 --> 37:43.900
I'm pretty sure that people can change.

37:43.903 --> 37:47.940
Barry's whole question this
season is, "Am I evil?"

37:47.945 --> 37:51.095
You feel like this is the
purest expression of the show.

37:51.096 --> 37:52.940
They're setting up
this rage that he has,

37:52.945 --> 37:54.650
and when it goes off, it would be good

37:54.654 --> 37:56.851
if it went off towards somebody.

37:56.852 --> 37:59.230
The Chechen bullet is
this kind of device

37:59.237 --> 38:01.564
where in show one,

38:01.565 --> 38:03.360
Hank gets the bullet from the Chechens

38:03.362 --> 38:06.277
and in show two, Hank gives
the bullet to Barry,

38:06.278 --> 38:08.520
and says, "I want you
to use this bullet."

38:08.529 --> 38:10.615
So whoever gets it, it's
gonna mean something,

38:10.616 --> 38:11.900
and the fact that it's Esther,

38:11.903 --> 38:13.785
the person it was supposed to go to,

38:13.786 --> 38:15.411
that was all kind of mapped out.

38:15.412 --> 38:17.230
The thing I like about this episode

38:17.237 --> 38:18.480
is if you remember in 201,

38:18.487 --> 38:21.020
the first time we see Barry,
he comes out darkness,

38:21.028 --> 38:24.159
and this episode ends with him
going back into darkness.

38:24.160 --> 38:26.790
I really love the
ending of this episode.

38:26.799 --> 38:28.508
It's very stark and real.

38:28.509 --> 38:31.360
Kinda similar to one of our...
our season ender last year,

38:31.362 --> 38:33.559
where it just kind of poses a question

38:33.560 --> 38:35.469
and we'll see what happens next.
