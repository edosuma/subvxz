Lucy Sable was crowned Sea Queen,

of her hair still in it.

who killed you, too.

So that Lisbeth, she
was something else, huh?

BESS: The thing is, I guess I've
just been on my own for so long,

00:28.463 --> 00:31.553
I've never let myself get
close to someone like that.

00:31.596 --> 00:35.078

I think Lucy wants me
to find something else.

Thanks, Lucy.
Way to be literal.

it was an urban legend.

Legend or not, steer clear.

03:52.319 --> 03:56.497
Rumor is, they brand townies

shady rich people

was targeting the Hudsons.

04:07.334 --> 04:10.598
Yeah, she was, but Owen's
name keeps popping up.

And the Hudsons and the Marvins
used to do business together,

04:13.035 --> 04:16.647

was digging up skeletons.

35:08.628 --> 35:11.152
that was a big mistake.

35:12.719 --> 35:15.330
Something bad happened
that night...

35:15.374 --> 35:19.813
and I tried... I tried to get
her to tell me what it was,

35:19.856 --> 35:21.771
and she wouldn't.

35:21.815 --> 35:25.645
I had this one good thing in
my life, and I ruined it.

35:25.688 --> 35:28.430
My parents, they would
never let me see her again,

35:28.474 --> 35:30.737
and every time Lucy
called, they...

35:30.780 --> 35:33.479
they wouldn't let
me talk to her.

35:34.654 --> 35:37.047
They just kept
telling me that...

35:37.091 --> 35:38.658
they handled it.

35:40.312 --> 35:43.445
How did they handle it?

35:46.056 --> 35:48.885
The same way they handled
everything back then.

36:18.219 --> 36:19.525
Tell me you have
an update, John.

36:19.568 --> 36:21.266
Oh, I have an update, John.

36:21.309 --> 36:24.356
Uh, Tiffany's sample's
gonna require more time,

36:24.399 --> 36:27.359
but Lucy's crown had
a second set of DNA.

36:27.402 --> 36:30.971
The hair samples present
belonged to two separate people.

36:31.014 --> 36:33.060
The first belonged to Lucy...
it matches the blood sample

36:33.103 --> 36:35.976
from the rocks. And the second must belong
to the guy who killed her.

36:36.019 --> 36:37.412
Actually, not a guy.

36:37.456 --> 36:39.022
A girl.

36:39.066 --> 36:41.634
The second hair sample
had female DNA.

36:43.375 --> 36:45.899
NANCY:
Maybe Celia Hudson did it

36:45.942 --> 36:48.249
and not my father.

36:49.294 --> 36:50.686
GEORGE:
Well...

36:50.730 --> 36:52.471
that was a disaster.

36:52.514 --> 36:54.908
Hmm. Pretty good

37:00.305 --> 37:03.264
Yeah, because you dove
headfirst into Lisbeth's face.

37:03.308 --> 37:04.352
Yeah!

37:04.396 --> 37:07.094
And... all failure aside,

stealing is.

Oh, come on.

No judging.

We're all still two-handed

When you get up the
guts to talk to him,

lead with that.

for you to help us?

out, I had to help.

that Lucy and Tiffany

only to find out
that my $1.5 million

38:59.119 --> 39:01.556
bought me a handful of quarters,

39:01.600 --> 39:04.037
one dime and...
six pennies.

39:04.080 --> 39:07.040
Maybe they're lucky pennies.

39:08.563 --> 39:11.523
I trust the coins will find
a good home, at least.

39:11.566 --> 39:15.396
And bring some justice for
the victims of the Bonny Scot.
