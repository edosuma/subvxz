WEBVTT

00:03.804 --> 00:05.106
Dang it!

00:05.139 --> 00:06.874
Sorry for the language.

00:06.907 --> 00:08.076
What's wrong?

00:08.109 --> 00:09.777
I got my paper back
on "Moby-Dick,"

00:09.810 --> 00:11.145
and Ms. Kelley gave me
a "D."

00:11.179 --> 00:12.213
A "d"?

00:12.246 --> 00:13.814
Yeah, a "D,"
as in, "Dang it!"

00:15.716 --> 00:17.218
Sorry again.

00:17.251 --> 00:20.221
Yeah, you better put a dollar
in the not-really-a-swear jar.

00:21.855 --> 00:23.624
Well, did Ms. Kelley
say why?

00:23.657 --> 00:25.559
She said
it wasn't my best work.

00:25.593 --> 00:27.861
Man, Ms. Kelley
really has it in for me.

00:27.895 --> 00:30.964
I don't remember her being
that tough when Molly had her.

00:30.998 --> 00:33.734
You got to catch her in a year
she has a boyfriend.

00:35.303 --> 00:36.904
She said I could redo it
if I want,

00:36.937 --> 00:39.407
but I think I should
just cut my losses.

00:39.440 --> 00:41.475
Really?
That's what you think?

00:41.509 --> 00:43.511
Ken,
you want to step in here?

00:43.544 --> 00:44.678
Gladly.

00:44.712 --> 00:46.114
Dave, don't redo it.

00:46.147 --> 00:48.882
It's obvious this angry
spinster doesn't get you.

00:48.916 --> 00:50.518
We'll switch schools,
baby.

00:50.551 --> 00:51.985
What? No!

00:52.019 --> 00:53.687
The answer I was
looking for is,

00:53.721 --> 00:55.789
"Of course do it again
and work harder."

00:55.823 --> 00:57.291
Okay, you got to tell me
these things ahead of time.

00:57.325 --> 00:59.427
I'm not a mind reader.

00:59.460 --> 01:01.095
Dave,
you're gonna do it again.

01:01.129 --> 01:03.097
Fine.
(CHUCKLES)

01:03.131 --> 01:05.032
She's tougher than
Ms. Kelley, am I right?

01:05.065 --> 01:06.867
Yeah?

01:06.900 --> 01:08.602
Maybe I also need
a boyfriend.

01:08.636 --> 01:09.870
Okay,
you needing a boyfriend

01:09.903 --> 01:11.472
is the theme
of too many of your jokes.

01:11.505 --> 01:13.141
You're on notice.

01:19.513 --> 01:20.848
(LAUGHS)

01:20.881 --> 01:23.684
Some patient give you
that sad-ass gas-station
plant?

01:24.552 --> 01:26.220
No, I actually got it
for you.

01:26.254 --> 01:28.922
Oh, it's beautiful!

01:28.956 --> 01:30.891
It's to thank you
for all the help
you've given me

01:30.924 --> 01:32.293
over the past few months,

01:32.326 --> 01:33.794
but they finally gave me
a full-time medical assistant

01:33.827 --> 01:34.962
from the pool.

01:34.995 --> 01:36.096
She starts today.

01:36.130 --> 01:38.332
Aww! Well,
I'm glad I was able to help.

01:38.366 --> 01:39.933
And the guy at Exxon said

01:39.967 --> 01:41.502
you should water that
once a day.

01:42.503 --> 01:43.771
I was in a rush!

01:45.339 --> 01:48.176
Remember,
start that amoxicillin ASAP.

01:48.209 --> 01:50.043
It'll knock your strep
right out of there.

01:50.077 --> 01:51.745
Thanks, Dr. Park.
You're the best.

01:51.779 --> 01:53.614
(CHUCKLING) Aww, I never
get tired of hearing that.

01:53.647 --> 01:55.115
Can you say that
again?

01:55.149 --> 01:56.417
You're the best.

01:56.450 --> 01:57.651
(CHUCKLES) Damona,
did you hear that?

01:57.685 --> 01:58.719
Hear what?

01:58.752 --> 02:00.154
One more time.
(CHUCKLES)

02:00.188 --> 02:01.822
It kind of hurts,
with the strep.

02:01.855 --> 02:03.391
Oh, yeah, you're right.
I'm, I'm sorry, yeah.

02:03.424 --> 02:05.693
Uh, but with all due respect,
you know...

02:05.726 --> 02:06.827
you did just say
all that.

02:06.860 --> 02:08.162
(CHUCKLES)

02:08.196 --> 02:09.297
You're the best!

02:09.330 --> 02:10.798
Aww, thank you!

02:10.831 --> 02:12.266
Now, rest that throat now,
you know?

02:12.300 --> 02:15.002
Yeah.
(CHUCKLES)

02:15.035 --> 02:18.138
Wow. Was that woman, like,
obsessed with me or what, huh?

02:21.008 --> 02:22.976
So, who's next?

02:23.010 --> 02:24.612
You got a walk-in.
He's a doctor.

02:24.645 --> 02:26.480
Donald Erwin?

02:26.514 --> 02:27.848
Dr. Erwin? Oh, no.

02:27.881 --> 02:29.483
Um, you know what?
Uh, give him to Dr. Tuttle.
I...

02:29.517 --> 02:31.151
He said
he only wants to see you.

02:31.185 --> 02:32.820
Is it that Dr. Erwin?

02:32.853 --> 02:34.021
Who is this Dr. Erwin?

02:34.054 --> 02:36.424
He was my attending physician
during residency.

02:36.457 --> 02:38.959
Brilliant cardiologist,
but intimidating as hell.

02:38.992 --> 02:40.894
I used to wonder how someone
could know so much

02:40.928 --> 02:42.530
about the heart
without having one.

02:44.565 --> 02:46.767
Why is he here?
To torment me?

02:46.800 --> 02:49.803
Is it not enough
that you almost failed me
out of residency?

02:49.837 --> 02:52.340
(SIGHS)
That was 20 years ago.

02:52.373 --> 02:54.007
You're not
a resident anymore.

02:54.041 --> 02:56.744
You're a full-on doctor
and a really good one.

02:56.777 --> 02:58.111
You're not wrong.

02:58.145 --> 02:59.780
A patient was just
going on and on

02:59.813 --> 03:02.250
about how I'm the best.
(LAUGHS)

03:02.283 --> 03:03.717
Come on, Ken,
there's no way

03:03.751 --> 03:06.186
he's gonna treat you the same
now as he did back then.

03:06.220 --> 03:07.388
(CHUCKLES)
You're right.

03:07.421 --> 03:08.556
I'm probably worried
about nothing.

03:08.589 --> 03:09.990
(CHUCKLES)

03:10.791 --> 03:12.360
Well...

03:12.393 --> 03:14.262
If it isn't Dr. Dummy.

03:16.430 --> 03:18.666
I don't know. It seems he is
gonna treat him the same.
Yeah.

03:18.699 --> 03:21.502
Yeah, just the same,
no difference at all.

03:30.143 --> 03:33.947
Hey, Pat.
You got a minute?

03:33.981 --> 03:38.085
Well, I'm pretty busy
right now, but,
uh...for you,

03:38.118 --> 03:39.720
this candy will go
un-crushed.

03:45.293 --> 03:46.760
Hi.
Hi.

03:48.095 --> 03:49.196
Um...

03:50.030 --> 03:52.032
what happened
the other day?

03:52.065 --> 03:54.201
Well,
we kissed passionately.

03:54.702 --> 03:56.103
Yeah, I know.

03:56.136 --> 03:57.505
Uh. (EXHALES SHARPLY)

03:57.538 --> 03:59.473
That kiss, it was...

03:59.507 --> 04:01.675
Impulsive
and inappropriate,

04:01.709 --> 04:04.545
and I guess my lips
just...took over.

04:04.578 --> 04:06.246
And I'm...

04:06.280 --> 04:07.748
I'm so sorry, Damona.

04:07.781 --> 04:09.283
I was going to say
it was nice.

04:09.317 --> 04:11.118
Oh, I couldn't agree more.

04:11.151 --> 04:12.586
(SCOFFS)

04:12.620 --> 04:13.787
Look, I just don't think

04:13.821 --> 04:14.922
we should jump right back
into things.

04:14.955 --> 04:16.324
I know.
You know?

04:16.357 --> 04:17.925
Maybe we take it slow,
see what happens.
Yeah.

04:17.958 --> 04:19.259
Uh-huh. Yeah, oh, no.
Absolutely.

04:19.293 --> 04:20.461
Yeah.
Thank you.

04:20.494 --> 04:22.363
So, if I'm, if I'm,
If I'm reading you clearly,

04:22.396 --> 04:25.032
uh, our "supply closet"
sessions...

04:25.065 --> 04:27.167
Yeah, we probably shouldn't
do any of that.
No?

04:27.200 --> 04:28.302
No, no.
You know what we'll do?

04:28.336 --> 04:29.470
We'll just...
We'll just, uh...

04:29.503 --> 04:31.672
stay in the shallow end
of the pool, as it were.

04:31.705 --> 04:33.507
Yeah, great, right.
Yeah.

04:33.541 --> 04:35.242
Shallow end it is.
Okay.

04:35.275 --> 04:36.944
(BOTH CHUCKLING)

04:37.745 --> 04:39.413
(SIGHS)
(SIGHS)

04:48.288 --> 04:50.658
DR. ERWIN: (CHUCKLES)
So, a guy comes into the E.R.

04:50.691 --> 04:53.226
We're already treating him
for a heart attack.

04:53.260 --> 04:55.929
Then, out of the blue,
there's this little voice.

04:55.963 --> 04:58.131
(HIGH-PITCHED VOICE)
"Could be shingles."

04:58.165 --> 05:01.001
(LAUGHING)
It's Dr. Dummy.

05:01.034 --> 05:03.871
We had just read a chapter
on shingles.

05:03.904 --> 05:06.273
Why did they call you
"Dr. Dummy"?

05:06.306 --> 05:07.608
(CHUCKLING)
That's a great story.

05:07.641 --> 05:10.778
See, Park here was trying
to be a doctor,
and he was a dummy.

05:10.811 --> 05:11.879
Wow.

05:12.613 --> 05:14.482
You spin quite a yarn.

05:16.684 --> 05:18.552
Dr. Erwin,
what brings you here?

05:18.586 --> 05:19.787
It's been some time.

05:19.820 --> 05:22.055
I thought you were safely
on the East Coast.

05:22.089 --> 05:24.958
Yeah, when I retired,
I moved out to L.A.

05:24.992 --> 05:27.395
and into the care
of Mr. Coffee here.

05:27.428 --> 05:28.929
Well, I thought it was
"Dr. Dummy."

05:28.962 --> 05:30.798
(CHUCKLING)
Great story.

05:30.831 --> 05:32.933
You see,
he used to get me coffee.

05:32.966 --> 05:35.703
We'd alternate between
Dr. Dummy and Mr. Coffee,

05:35.736 --> 05:37.971
because when he wasn't
being a dummy,

05:38.005 --> 05:40.608
he was getting me coffee.

05:40.641 --> 05:42.610
Yeah, maybe it's the phrase
"great story"

05:42.643 --> 05:44.277
that keeps throwing me.

05:44.311 --> 05:47.848
Okay, now that
we're caught up on
my various clever nicknames,

05:47.881 --> 05:49.783
what seems to be
the problem?

05:49.817 --> 05:52.820
I've been experiencing
paresthesia in both legs

05:52.853 --> 05:55.155
the last two days.

05:55.188 --> 05:59.860
Hmm, burning and tingling
sensation, both legs.

05:59.893 --> 06:01.395
Are you in any pain?

06:01.429 --> 06:03.263
No, it feels great.

06:03.296 --> 06:05.699
It's the fun kind
of paresthesia.

06:05.733 --> 06:07.034
No, I just meant,
are you...

06:07.067 --> 06:09.537
Yeah, I know what you meant.
What could be causing this?

06:09.570 --> 06:11.371
Sir, well,
I think it could be...

06:11.405 --> 06:13.774
Come on, Park.
A toddler could
diagnose this.

06:13.807 --> 06:15.943
That would be
an extraordinary toddler.

06:15.976 --> 06:17.878
What is
the differential diagnosis

06:17.911 --> 06:19.480
of paresthesia
of the legs?

06:19.513 --> 06:21.482
Uh, multiple etiologies.
You have to consider the...

06:21.515 --> 06:23.417
Come on!
Spit it out, Park!
(STAMMERING)

06:23.451 --> 06:25.653
I know! I know!
Sugar-betes?

06:27.254 --> 06:28.589
Excuse me?

06:29.389 --> 06:30.891
Diabetes?

06:30.924 --> 06:32.159
And here I was,

06:32.192 --> 06:34.562
pronouncing it wrong
all these years.

06:34.595 --> 06:36.129
Don't have that.

06:36.163 --> 06:39.567
Spinal stenosis
is what I'm thinking.

06:39.600 --> 06:40.968
My God,
20 years later,

06:41.001 --> 06:42.536
and you still don't get it,
do you?

06:42.570 --> 06:44.438
You know what?
Make yourself useful.

06:44.472 --> 06:48.642
Order me a diabetic panel,
an MRI of my back, and a CB2S.

06:49.142 --> 06:50.277
Yes, sir.

06:50.310 --> 06:51.812
What's a CB2S?

06:51.845 --> 06:53.881
Coffee black,
two sugars.

06:57.217 --> 06:59.219
Ooh, Dr. Park,
Ms. Carlisle just called.

06:59.252 --> 07:00.320
She canceled her 1:00.

07:00.353 --> 07:01.655
Thanks, Kylie.
I appreciate it.

07:01.689 --> 07:02.856
You want to know
something funny?

07:02.890 --> 07:04.625
Ms. Carlisle lives
on Sepulveda.

07:04.658 --> 07:06.694
When I first moved out here
from Omaha,

07:06.727 --> 07:08.295
I lived on Sepulveda.
Wow.

07:08.328 --> 07:10.898
With my old boyfriend, Gary,
didn't work out.

07:10.931 --> 07:13.767
No ambition, I mean, just
a total man-child, you know?
Okay, yeah.

07:13.801 --> 07:15.869
I got out of there
as fast as I could,

07:15.903 --> 07:17.838
which was about
four miles an hour,

07:17.871 --> 07:19.239
'cause of the traffic.
Yeah.

07:19.272 --> 07:20.407
But it is near the beach.

07:20.440 --> 07:22.009
Of course,
you can't get there...

07:22.042 --> 07:23.811
(LAUGHING)
'cause of the traffic.

07:23.844 --> 07:25.045
Right. I got
to get some paperwork
done to...

07:25.078 --> 07:26.580
Really, the only thing
Gary and I had in common

07:26.614 --> 07:27.981
was Game of Thrones.

07:28.015 --> 07:29.983
(GASPING) Dr. Park!
Do you watch
Game of Thrones?

07:30.017 --> 07:31.318
No, so I guess
I'm the wrong person...

07:31.351 --> 07:32.853
Oh, don't be silly.
There are only six seasons.

07:32.886 --> 07:34.187
I can fill you in
real quick.

07:34.221 --> 07:35.489
Okay, season one,

07:35.523 --> 07:36.757
fade in...

07:40.694 --> 07:42.095
What's with you?

07:42.129 --> 07:44.498
Oh,
it's just my sandwich.

07:44.532 --> 07:46.600
That chicken salad is
nine kinds of awful.

07:46.634 --> 07:49.937
Yeah, I'm sure the chicken
would agree with you.

07:49.970 --> 07:51.872
You know, you got to be
the snarkiest vegan

07:51.905 --> 07:53.040
on God's green earth.

07:53.073 --> 07:56.076
Oh, no, no, not even close.
Really, no.

07:56.109 --> 07:57.878
(RINGTONE BARKING)

08:01.849 --> 08:03.283
Aren't you gonna
answer that?

08:03.316 --> 08:05.152
Nah, it's probably
just some telemarketer.

08:05.185 --> 08:07.487
(BARKING CONTINUES)

08:07.521 --> 08:09.623
Okay,
'cause it says "Eric."

08:11.358 --> 08:14.094
The telemarketer's name
is Eric.

08:14.127 --> 08:16.664
So, this telemarketer has
the same name

08:16.697 --> 08:19.800
and barking-dog ringtone
as your boyfriend?

08:19.833 --> 08:21.034
Uh-huh.

08:23.537 --> 08:25.172
And you programed him
into your phone.

08:25.205 --> 08:27.440
Yes, yes, yes, I did.
And you know
what he's selling?

08:27.474 --> 08:29.677
Subscriptions to
None of Your Damn
Business Weekly.

08:31.411 --> 08:34.414
Okay, I know that
that is not a real magazine.

08:39.186 --> 08:40.588
Hey, Mol.
How was your day?

08:40.621 --> 08:41.855
Fine. Yours?

08:41.889 --> 08:43.256
Long.

08:43.290 --> 08:45.826
My new medical assistant,
Kylie, started today.

08:45.859 --> 08:49.863
She's like a conversational
Bermuda Triangle.

08:49.897 --> 08:52.332
I mean, if you want to know
anything about
Game of Thrones

08:52.365 --> 08:55.068
or traffic in West L.A.,
she's your gal.

08:57.270 --> 08:58.371
Oh, okay.
Well, I better...

08:58.405 --> 09:00.073
And I thought
about saying something to her,

09:00.107 --> 09:01.541
but I don't want to
hurt her feelings

09:01.575 --> 09:02.976
or make it awkward
between us.

09:03.010 --> 09:04.477
But, my God,
do you know what it's like

09:04.511 --> 09:06.046
when you're trying
to get something done,

09:06.079 --> 09:09.850
and there's someone
there yakking and yakking
and yakking

09:09.883 --> 09:11.551
and won't shut up?

09:12.385 --> 09:14.287
I think I have a sense.

09:15.422 --> 09:17.625
I'm gonna go study
in my room.

09:18.558 --> 09:20.493
Well, 20 years later,

09:20.527 --> 09:22.763
Dr. Erwin's still making
my life a living hell.

09:22.796 --> 09:24.031
Ugh! It didn't go well?

09:24.064 --> 09:27.034
No, I fell right back to
my old, insecure resident self

09:27.067 --> 09:28.936
the second he called me
"Dr. Dummy."

09:28.969 --> 09:30.170
(CHUCKLING)

09:30.203 --> 09:32.840
There's nothing funny
about that.

09:32.873 --> 09:35.609
This feels worse than
when he gave me low
scores in residency.

09:35.643 --> 09:36.944
He always gave me
two out of five

09:36.977 --> 09:38.145
in my evaluations.

09:38.178 --> 09:40.147
I knew I should've punted him
to another doctor

09:40.180 --> 09:41.214
the minute he came in.

09:41.248 --> 09:43.116
Well, I've surrendered
to writer's block.

09:43.150 --> 09:44.918
Anyone up
for some "Boggle"?

09:44.952 --> 09:46.920
No, you have to
get that paper done.

09:46.954 --> 09:47.988
What's the point?

09:48.021 --> 09:50.724
Ms. Kelley's always
gonna be against me.

09:51.291 --> 09:52.425
You know what, Dave?

09:52.459 --> 09:53.894
I've been thinking
about this.

09:53.927 --> 09:57.164
This is a golden opportunity
for you to push back

09:57.197 --> 09:59.466
against a teacher who doesn't
think you have what it takes.

09:59.499 --> 10:02.535
This is the best thing
that ever happened to you.

10:02.569 --> 10:05.305
You've got to walk in there
unafraid and prove yourself.

10:05.338 --> 10:07.574
Make her feel foolish
for ever doubting you.

10:07.607 --> 10:08.909
Wow. Thanks, Dad.

10:08.942 --> 10:10.177
You got it, pal.

10:10.210 --> 10:11.444
You can do this!

10:11.478 --> 10:13.480
Yeah! Whoo!
Yes, yes!

10:13.513 --> 10:15.916
Yes! Whoo!

10:15.949 --> 10:18.786
So, how am I gonna handle
this Dr. Erwin situation?

10:28.762 --> 10:30.898
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
Wait, wait, Pat.

10:30.931 --> 10:32.966
(SIGHS)
I'm not sure I can do this.

10:33.000 --> 10:34.534
Oh, fine.

10:34.567 --> 10:35.836
Just leave the heavy lifting
to me.

10:35.869 --> 10:38.138
No, no, I mean...

10:38.171 --> 10:40.173
we said we were
gonna take this slow.

10:40.207 --> 10:41.742
Yeah, turned out that was
just idle banter

10:41.775 --> 10:43.877
on the way
to the supply closet.

10:43.911 --> 10:45.645
But what are we doing?

10:45.679 --> 10:48.215
We're living in the moment.
Why question it, Damona?

10:48.248 --> 10:50.617
(SCOFFS)
I have to question it, Pat!

10:50.650 --> 10:51.985
We lived in the moment
the last time,

10:52.019 --> 10:53.253
and that didn't work out.

10:53.286 --> 10:55.355
You know who lives
in the moment, Pat?

10:55.388 --> 10:57.290
Teenagers.

10:57.324 --> 10:59.727
Are you calling me
youthful?

10:59.760 --> 11:02.229
(SIGHS) No.

11:02.262 --> 11:04.564
I'm saying that I need
to be with someone

11:04.597 --> 11:06.499
who actually thinks of
things like the future

11:06.533 --> 11:08.969
and not just
the next time we hook up.

11:09.002 --> 11:11.038
I need to be
with an adult.

11:12.639 --> 11:14.441
Well,
I resent that, Damona.

11:14.474 --> 11:16.977
I am very much an adult.

11:17.010 --> 11:20.180
I have a job, a home,
a messy divorce,

11:20.213 --> 11:23.350
some might call that
"the adult trifecta."

11:23.383 --> 11:25.252
I'm sorry,
I got to go.

me further?

Okay, look, I know
you don't want to
talk about it,

11:41.168 --> 11:43.003
but is there something
going on with you and Eric?

11:43.036 --> 11:44.471
No.

11:44.504 --> 11:46.473
If I stare at you
with my piercing blue eyes,

11:46.506 --> 11:48.041
will you tell me?

11:48.075 --> 11:49.109
No.

11:56.283 --> 11:57.550
Damn it!
Those things are icy.

11:57.584 --> 11:58.786
Mm-hmm.

11:59.152 --> 12:00.520
Okay.

12:00.553 --> 12:03.390
This is just between us,
and please do not gasp.

12:03.423 --> 12:04.691
I'm thinking
about breaking up with Eric.

12:04.724 --> 12:07.494
(GASPS LOUDLY)
What did I just say?

12:07.527 --> 12:08.762
What happened?

12:08.796 --> 12:10.630
That I can't tell you.

12:10.663 --> 12:13.666
And, And I'm not even
100% sure it's the
right thing to do.

12:13.700 --> 12:15.635
And either way, I don't want
to hurt his feelings.

12:15.668 --> 12:17.604
So that's why
you're ghosting him.

12:17.637 --> 12:19.539
I'm not ghosting anybody!

12:19.572 --> 12:21.341

12:31.819 --> 12:33.053
Thank you for calling
the Jerk Chicken Hut.

12:33.086 --> 12:35.388
This is Sampson speaking.

12:35.422 --> 12:36.623
No, mon!
You got the wrong number!

12:36.656 --> 12:38.691
Bye.

12:38.725 --> 12:41.628
You are ghosting him,
and really well, I might add.

12:41.661 --> 12:44.231
I totally want to know more
about this Sampson character.

12:44.264 --> 12:46.033
(NORMAL VOICE) Okay,
can you get away from me?

12:46.066 --> 12:47.234
Can you leave me alone?

12:47.267 --> 12:49.402
Well, I guess I'm just
the little wooden boy

12:49.436 --> 12:51.638
who doesn't have
any feelings.

12:57.244 --> 12:59.179
So...

12:59.212 --> 13:02.015
You're the sort of person
who ghosts people,

13:02.049 --> 13:04.417
as the kids and Clark say.

13:05.785 --> 13:08.621
And I'm the one
who's not an adult. Hmm.

13:08.655 --> 13:10.390
Okay,
wait a minute, Pat.

13:10.423 --> 13:12.659
Save it, Damona.
You're right.

13:12.692 --> 13:14.661
There aren't enough grown-ups
between the two of us

13:14.694 --> 13:16.729
for an adult relationship.

13:22.302 --> 13:24.071
Oh.

13:24.104 --> 13:26.673
Well, hopefully today will be
more productive.

13:26.706 --> 13:30.777
I'd give yesterday's
performance a one out of five.

13:30.810 --> 13:34.114
That's even lower than
you got back in the day, huh?

13:34.614 --> 13:36.549
Fun times.

13:36.583 --> 13:41.955
So, which disc is it,
L4-l5, l5-s1?

13:41.989 --> 13:44.925
Actually,
your MRI results are normal.

13:44.958 --> 13:46.493
It's not spinal stenosis.

13:46.526 --> 13:47.627
What?

13:48.228 --> 13:50.663
Let me see that.

13:50.697 --> 13:53.766

diabetes panel was negative.

13:53.800 --> 13:54.902

any sense.

or stenosis,

thinking here?

Spinal tumor?
Multiple myeloma?

Well, not necessarily.
It could be something else.

find anything!

with your bloodwork.

That's a good one.
You got me.

17:48.901 --> 17:50.036
(IMITATING DR. ERWIN)
All right.

17:50.069 --> 17:51.271
That's a good one.
You got me.

17:51.304 --> 17:53.106
Don't push it, Park.
(NORMAL VOICE) Copy.

17:59.379 --> 18:01.047
Hello, Damona.

18:01.080 --> 18:02.382
Okay.

18:02.415 --> 18:03.650
You were right.

18:03.683 --> 18:06.619
I wasn't handling Eric
like an adult.

18:06.653 --> 18:09.556
So I called him,
and I told him it was over.

18:10.390 --> 18:12.392
I'm sorry to hear that.

18:14.294 --> 18:15.695
You're smiling.

18:15.728 --> 18:18.631
Yeah, I smile
when I'm sorry to hear things.

18:20.066 --> 18:23.170
Also, I feel like...
I owe you an apology.

18:23.203 --> 18:25.805
I spun out 'cause...

18:26.406 --> 18:27.874
(CHUCKLES)

18:27.907 --> 18:29.108
...I was scared.

18:29.142 --> 18:30.510
Of what?

18:30.543 --> 18:33.180
Of this, of us,

18:33.213 --> 18:35.715
of the fact
that we tried this last year,

18:35.748 --> 18:36.916
and it didn't work.

18:36.949 --> 18:38.285
And to be quite honest, Pat,

18:38.318 --> 18:40.987
I wasn't really sure
you were right for me.

18:41.020 --> 18:42.555
But you were so supportive

18:42.589 --> 18:44.457
when I was having problems
with Eric,

18:44.491 --> 18:47.494
and you've always
been there for me.

18:47.527 --> 18:50.197
And maybe...
what I wanted was

18:50.230 --> 18:52.399
right in front of me
the whole time.

18:52.432 --> 18:55.568
Well, my feelings for you
have never changed.

18:55.602 --> 18:57.904
I've always just wanted you
to be happy.

18:57.937 --> 18:59.206
(SIGHS)

19:00.006 --> 19:01.574
Thanks, Pat.

19:01.608 --> 19:03.976
I think you're probably right,
you know?

19:04.010 --> 19:07.614
Taking it slow is
the best thing we could do.

19:07.647 --> 19:09.749
So I'm gonna suggest
that we sidebar the physical

19:09.782 --> 19:11.251
and just focus
on the emotional.

19:11.284 --> 19:12.619
Wow.
Mm-hmm.

19:12.652 --> 19:13.886
Okay.

19:13.920 --> 19:15.988
That is a very good plan.
Mm-hmm.

19:16.022 --> 19:17.424
Very adult!
Ah.

19:17.457 --> 19:18.925
(BOTH CHUCKLING)

19:18.958 --> 19:20.460
(BOTH MOANING)

19:21.461 --> 19:22.895
Later, we'll focus
on the emotional.

19:22.929 --> 19:24.231
Yeah, first thing
tomorrow morning.
Yeah.

19:24.264 --> 19:25.598
(BOTH MOANING)

19:32.539 --> 19:34.441
I, uh...

19:34.474 --> 19:37.176
just wanted to thank you again
for helping me out.

19:37.210 --> 19:39.612
Well, I'm just glad
it wasn't something worse.

19:39.646 --> 19:41.514
I appreciate it.

19:41.548 --> 19:43.082
See you around.

19:44.384 --> 19:46.486
Actually, Dr. Erwin,
can I ask you something?

19:46.519 --> 19:47.554
No.

19:50.189 --> 19:52.225
Fine.

19:52.259 --> 19:54.361
Why did you always give me
such a hard time?

19:54.394 --> 19:57.163
Because I knew
you could handle it.

19:57.196 --> 19:58.798
I knew you were good.

19:58.831 --> 20:00.166
Good?

20:00.199 --> 20:02.435
You never gave me anything
higher than a two.

20:02.469 --> 20:05.171
Because that's where
I thought you were
at the time.

20:05.204 --> 20:07.073
If I'd have given you
a false five,

20:07.106 --> 20:09.509
it wouldn't motivate you
to do better.

20:09.542 --> 20:11.944
There are too many attendings
that hand out fives

20:11.978 --> 20:13.513
like participation trophies,

20:13.546 --> 20:16.249
and this is not
rec-league basketball.

20:16.283 --> 20:17.717
This is medicine,

20:17.750 --> 20:19.286
life and death.

20:20.653 --> 20:23.856
I had to push you
to get you where you are.

20:23.890 --> 20:25.692
And you got there.

20:25.725 --> 20:28.528
I could have gone
to any doctor, Park...

20:28.561 --> 20:29.929
but I chose you.

20:29.962 --> 20:31.063
Me?

20:31.097 --> 20:33.566
Because I knew
you could help me.

20:33.600 --> 20:36.035
I could've been paralyzed,
Park.

20:36.068 --> 20:37.937
And thanks to you, I'm not.

20:37.970 --> 20:39.606
Well, it's only 'cause
I learned from the best.

20:39.639 --> 20:40.873
Shut up!

20:43.576 --> 20:47.146
I guess I have been
pretty hard on you over
the years.

20:47.179 --> 20:48.815
Sorry about that.

20:49.616 --> 20:50.883
You know what?

20:50.917 --> 20:53.453
I'm finally gonna give you
your five.

20:54.787 --> 20:56.055
Um...

20:56.088 --> 20:58.190
Could I get that
in writing?

21:06.232 --> 21:08.335
(CHUCKLES)
Thank you, sir.

21:11.638 --> 21:13.039
Be well, Dr. Erwin.

21:13.072 --> 21:14.374
You, too.

21:14.407 --> 21:15.875
See you in a month or so.

21:15.908 --> 21:17.344
Why?

21:17.377 --> 21:19.612
Because you're my doctor
now...

21:20.413 --> 21:21.681
Dr. Park.

21:23.716 --> 21:24.984
