01:17.077 --> 01:20.254
Traveling is all
about experiencing new things.

01:21.777 --> 01:24.736
♪ Prefer to spend
my time in the ♪

01:24.736 --> 01:26.869
Pushing your own
self boundaries.

01:26.869 --> 01:29.654
My goal this year would be
to definitely travel more.

01:32.483 --> 01:34.790
You're so limited if you
don't get out to the world

01:34.790 --> 01:37.053
and experience it for yourself.

01:37.053 --> 01:38.533
There's that old saying,

01:38.533 --> 01:40.361
The world is a book and
if you don't travel,

01:40.361 --> 01:41.971
you've only read one page.

01:41.971 --> 01:43.842
Why limit yourself?

01:43.842 --> 01:47.150
It's really made me realize
how little I've actually seen.

01:47.150 --> 01:49.674
Thailand has such
a rich history.

01:49.674 --> 01:51.546
I feel so at peace here.

01:51.546 --> 01:54.766
I loved soaking it all in
and really experiencing Asia

01:54.766 --> 01:57.247
the way it was meant
to be experienced,

01:57.247 --> 01:58.857
away from my comfort zone.

01:59.945 --> 02:01.773
It's breathtaking.

02:01.773 --> 02:03.732
The adventures that find you
if you just surrender to what

02:03.732 --> 02:05.647
the universe throws at you.

02:05.647 --> 02:08.128
I am really seeing Thailand.

02:08.128 --> 02:10.347
Just downed my
third rum and coke.

02:11.435 --> 02:12.610
I'll be here all night.

02:14.351 --> 02:16.919
If you truly
surrender to a moment,

02:16.919 --> 02:19.269
you realize that's all you need.

02:20.357 --> 02:21.880
There's a certain freedom

02:21.880 --> 02:24.144
to not knowing exactly
what's coming next.

02:24.144 --> 02:27.712
There's so many amazing people
here living in the moment.

02:29.497 --> 02:31.629
Making new friends
all around the world,

02:31.629 --> 02:33.370
they see things differently.

02:33.370 --> 02:36.417
It's such a huge difference
compared to America.

02:36.417 --> 02:39.333
And I loved soaking it all in.

02:39.333 --> 02:43.119
Only a few more days left here
and really taking it all in.

02:44.207 --> 02:45.034
Love you all.

02:54.957 --> 02:57.742
Hey guys, another
day in paradise.

02:57.742 --> 03:00.745
Just recording, watching a
beautiful sunset on the beach.

03:00.745 --> 03:02.182
Anyhow...

03:07.796 --> 03:11.103
So I told myself this feels
like a bad idea, you know?

03:11.103 --> 03:14.411
And he did turn out to be
as dumb as he was cute.

03:16.239 --> 03:18.110
But we went back to his place.

03:18.110 --> 03:21.331
Probably one of the
biggest regrets of my life.

03:21.331 --> 03:22.593
Seems
like every night's

03:22.593 --> 03:24.421
the biggest regret of your life.

03:24.421 --> 03:25.988
I wish I could
trade places with you,

03:25.988 --> 03:27.729
I'm so jealous.

03:27.729 --> 03:29.557
I had two tickets.

03:29.557 --> 03:30.906
Told you you'd regret it.

03:32.386 --> 03:33.343
Wait a minute.

03:33.343 --> 03:35.911
Wait, what is that up?

03:35.911 --> 03:38.087
That hasn't even come out yet!

03:38.087 --> 03:40.742
Oh girl, you need to talk
to Ryan about getting me

03:40.742 --> 03:42.961
on this Adelaine gravy train.

03:42.961 --> 03:45.442
I don't think I
will be much longer.

03:45.442 --> 03:47.314
I've been really
thinking about it.

03:47.314 --> 03:50.317
Wait, honey, that boy put
you in that place for a week.

03:50.317 --> 03:52.536
And he was
supposed to be here.

03:52.536 --> 03:54.408
You know what?

03:54.408 --> 03:55.931
I wish I was dating someone
who cared about my career.

03:55.931 --> 03:57.715
I just think that
it hasn't been--

03:57.715 --> 03:58.890
What?

03:58.890 --> 04:00.588
Oh no, it's just Madison.

04:00.588 --> 04:01.806
Oh yeah, I can go.

04:01.806 --> 04:03.373
Oh yeah, okay.

04:03.373 --> 04:06.420
I gotta go, talk to Ryan
for me, and smile more.

04:49.027 --> 04:51.203
I'd be
happy to lend a hand.

04:51.203 --> 04:52.074
Sorry?

04:53.467 --> 04:56.426
The photo, I could
take it for you.

04:56.426 --> 04:58.515
Oh, I think I got it.

05:00.561 --> 05:01.823
Thought I should offer.

05:08.220 --> 05:11.398
So where are you from?

05:13.878 --> 05:15.663
California, originally.

05:16.794 --> 05:20.232
Ah, a California gal, eh?

05:20.232 --> 05:22.234
I suppose I should
have guessed, really.

05:22.234 --> 05:24.541
British myself.

05:26.587 --> 05:29.024
So what brings
you to Thailand?

05:30.547 --> 05:32.201
The wonderful women.

05:33.724 --> 05:35.509
No, no, only joking.

05:35.509 --> 05:39.077
Really, I just came here
to escape the British rain.

05:40.209 --> 05:42.907
Came for a visit and never left.

05:42.907 --> 05:45.257
Could never think of a good
reason why I should go back

05:45.257 --> 05:49.087
to that miserable country
and the miserable women.

05:51.873 --> 05:55.224
But look, if you are
here all on your own,

05:55.224 --> 05:57.574
why don't I show
you a round a bit?

05:58.662 --> 06:00.316
Come on man, get a hint.

06:01.622 --> 06:04.973
Just trying to be cordial.

06:04.973 --> 06:06.583
We're all friends here, eh?

06:08.019 --> 06:09.543
I'm going for a walk
if you wanna come.

06:10.674 --> 06:11.501
Sure.

06:15.244 --> 06:16.114
Nice meeting you.

06:20.118 --> 06:21.163
You really
gotta be careful

06:21.163 --> 06:22.294
around guys like that.

06:23.905 --> 06:24.732
Him?

06:25.602 --> 06:27.430
He was harmless.

06:27.430 --> 06:29.867
Yeah, at first.

06:29.867 --> 06:31.434
Get a few more drinks in them

06:31.434 --> 06:32.957
and then the real
side comes out.

06:34.263 --> 06:35.699
"Hello, love.

06:35.699 --> 06:38.485
"Would you fancy a
nightcap at my place?"

06:40.095 --> 06:41.618
Suddenly that drink
you've been nursing

06:41.618 --> 06:43.446
starts to hit you a
little differently

06:43.446 --> 06:45.361
and then before you know it...

06:46.971 --> 06:47.798
Trust me.

06:53.891 --> 06:56.328
What are you doing traveling
by yourself anyways?

06:57.678 --> 06:59.375
It's a long story.

06:59.375 --> 07:00.420
Shorten it for me.

07:05.033 --> 07:06.817
Come on.

07:06.817 --> 07:09.254
You're in one of the most
beautiful places in the world.

07:09.254 --> 07:11.256
What could possibly
be wrong with that?

07:13.084 --> 07:16.261
Well, my boyfriend and I
planned this trip together

07:16.261 --> 07:18.699
and the last minute he bailed.

07:19.700 --> 07:20.527
Bummer.

07:22.398 --> 07:25.706
All I ever hear is about
how magical this place is.

07:27.098 --> 07:28.752
How you meet people
from all over.

07:30.275 --> 07:32.495
All I've really done
is sit by the pool.

07:37.544 --> 07:39.241
What are your plans tomorrow?

07:41.678 --> 07:42.505
I don't know.

08:36.167 --> 08:39.562
Come on, the sun's
starting to come up!

08:45.655 --> 08:46.526
Wow.

08:51.356 --> 08:54.316
You guys won't believe how
beautiful it is up here.

08:54.316 --> 08:56.144
If you aren't on an
early morning hike,

08:56.144 --> 08:59.234
you are missing out.

09:00.844 --> 09:02.759
Since when are you suddenly shy?

09:04.195 --> 09:05.414
I just don't like
being on camera.

09:06.981 --> 09:07.808
Okay.

09:16.730 --> 09:18.732
How does it look?

09:22.213 --> 09:24.476
So you really don't have
a place to go back to.

09:24.476 --> 09:27.958
I mean I have family here
and there, but no, not really.

09:27.958 --> 09:29.786
It must be so freeing.

09:29.786 --> 09:31.614
It has its ups and downs.

10:08.912 --> 10:10.261
It's better hot.

10:10.261 --> 10:11.523
Yeah, I can't wait.

10:15.440 --> 10:17.486
You've never taken a
picture of your food?

10:17.486 --> 10:18.966
I usually prefer to eat it.

10:23.057 --> 10:24.624
Oh my god.

10:24.624 --> 10:26.147
It's the closest
thing you can get

10:26.147 --> 10:27.714
to a home cooked
meal around here.

10:27.714 --> 10:30.499
This is the kind of
place Ryan would find.

10:30.499 --> 10:32.370
So why isn't he
here with you now?

11:24.509 --> 11:26.511
I don't know, he was cute.

11:26.511 --> 11:29.036
Ugh, I am too drunk.

11:29.036 --> 11:30.428
You all good?

11:30.428 --> 11:31.821
Yeah.

11:31.821 --> 11:32.866
Thanks.

11:36.608 --> 11:39.176
I wish I met you
sooner.

12:26.963 --> 12:27.790
Hello?

13:36.163 --> 13:38.034
The report's all filed
now and I'll keep a lookout,

13:38.034 --> 13:39.601
but you know tourist police.

13:39.601 --> 13:41.429
There's not a whole
lot they can do.

13:48.218 --> 13:50.438
I don't
understand any of this.

13:50.438 --> 13:52.005
It's the usual.

13:52.005 --> 13:53.615
First name, last name,
mother's maiden name.

13:55.443 --> 13:57.271
We'll expedite it, it takes
like two weeks at the most.

13:57.271 --> 13:59.099
Two weeks?

13:59.099 --> 14:01.057
You are gonna have
to travel up to Bangkok

14:01.057 --> 14:03.364
to pick up your new
passport from the embassy.

14:04.452 --> 14:06.280
Is it awful for me to say that

14:06.280 --> 14:07.934
I hate the idea of being
stuck here two more weeks?

14:07.934 --> 14:09.892
You don't have to be here.

14:09.892 --> 14:11.285
You can come crash with me.

14:11.285 --> 14:12.460
I'll show you around.

14:12.460 --> 14:13.940
No, I couldn't put you out.

14:13.940 --> 14:16.333
Hey, it's gonna be fine.

14:21.251 --> 14:22.383
First name right here.

14:37.920 --> 14:41.315
Hey, I'm just getting
a few things sorted here.

14:41.315 --> 14:42.142
How's it going?

14:42.142 --> 14:43.839
Yeah, good.

14:43.839 --> 14:46.276
Just been so busy,
feel like I'm drowning.

14:47.190 --> 14:48.757
Nice.

14:48.757 --> 14:51.673
Your flight gets
in at 7:00, right?

14:51.673 --> 14:53.501
So listen, just--

14:53.501 --> 14:55.024
'Cause I've got a
shoot earlier in the morning,

14:55.024 --> 14:56.721
so I might need you
to take your car.

14:56.721 --> 14:58.027
Is that all right?

14:58.027 --> 14:58.898
Ryan.

14:58.898 --> 15:00.464
What?

15:00.464 --> 15:02.510
I'm not gonna make my flight.

15:02.510 --> 15:04.120
What do you mean?

15:04.120 --> 15:05.774
Someone broke into my room.

15:06.688 --> 15:08.342
I'm not following.

15:10.039 --> 15:12.128
My passport was stolen.

15:14.522 --> 15:16.306
It's fine, I'm getting
a temporary one.

15:16.306 --> 15:18.265
It just could take
a couple weeks.

15:18.265 --> 15:19.440
You have a shoot on Monday.

15:19.440 --> 15:21.224
I'm not doing this on purpose.

15:21.224 --> 15:24.184
This is so...

15:24.184 --> 15:25.794
What?

15:25.794 --> 15:26.664
So you.

15:31.452 --> 15:33.323
You know, you're the one
who wanted me to be here.

15:33.323 --> 15:35.499
For a week and then you
decided you wanted to stay

15:35.499 --> 15:38.415
for two and now how
long is this gonna be?

15:41.114 --> 15:42.071
Why don't you just
talk me through

15:42.071 --> 15:43.246
what's happened so far?

15:43.246 --> 15:44.769
Have you been to the embassy?

15:44.769 --> 15:46.597
I didn't call to have you--

15:46.597 --> 15:48.034
I'm just trying to understand
how you've let this happen.

15:48.034 --> 15:49.600
I didn't let this happen.

15:49.600 --> 15:51.646
I don't understand why
you're getting upset.

15:51.646 --> 15:52.647
I'm trying to help.

15:55.780 --> 15:57.608
You know, I've been
thinking about how to say this

15:57.608 --> 15:58.958
for the last few weeks.

16:01.612 --> 16:03.005
I think we need to break up.

16:05.268 --> 16:06.443
Why don't you call
me again in the morning

16:06.443 --> 16:07.705
when you've calmed down?

16:14.756 --> 16:16.584
Mads--

16:24.853 --> 16:26.681
Change of plans.

16:26.681 --> 16:28.770
Looks like I'll be staying
here for a while longer.

16:28.770 --> 16:30.815
I know some of you wanted
to see the next phase

16:30.815 --> 16:34.210
of the adventure in Europe,
but that will have to wait.

16:34.210 --> 16:35.690
I made a new friend.

16:35.690 --> 16:37.213
We're going to
explore the country.

16:41.217 --> 16:45.482
♪ I try to make you slow
down, show you around ♪

16:45.482 --> 16:50.531

18:33.286 --> 18:34.200
Hey.

18:57.353 --> 18:59.094
This place is legit.

18:59.094 --> 19:01.575
Why would you ever leave?

19:01.575 --> 19:04.491
You don't meet people
holed up in the jungle.

19:21.377 --> 19:22.726
Just make yourself at home.

19:32.258 --> 19:34.129
So I was looking
a few things up

19:34.129 --> 19:36.044
and I have some ideas for
what we should do tomorrow.

19:37.480 --> 19:39.221
I actually have a
surprise for tomorrow.

19:40.657 --> 19:41.658
Surprise?

19:44.095 --> 19:44.966
You'll see.

20:03.680 --> 20:05.595
You have your own boat?

20:05.595 --> 20:06.727
It's not a big deal.

20:11.558 --> 20:13.255
Look at what we
have this morning.

20:13.255 --> 20:14.430
Hey!

20:14.430 --> 20:15.910
Just wait 'till we get there.

20:41.718 --> 20:43.111
How much longer?

21:12.488 --> 21:14.403
How did you find this place?

21:15.926 --> 21:17.667
I spent a lot of
time in the ocean.

21:19.190 --> 21:20.931
My dad had a sailboat
when I was growing up,

21:20.931 --> 21:23.499
So I learned how to
navigate when I was young.

21:25.849 --> 21:27.764
Just always wanted a
place to get away to

21:27.764 --> 21:31.377
and leave my dirt
behind, refresh.

21:59.100 --> 22:00.275
You finally got a break.

22:12.592 --> 22:14.245
I just realized I haven't been

22:14.245 --> 22:17.031
in front of a fire
in like a decade.

22:18.554 --> 22:19.773
It was in girl scouts.

22:21.252 --> 22:24.081
We used to sit around
telling scary stories.

22:26.997 --> 22:31.567
There was this one
girl, forget her name.

22:33.308 --> 22:36.355
She used to tell
the darkest shit.

22:40.010 --> 22:41.664
She'd probably
think you brought me

22:41.664 --> 22:45.625
all this way to
kill me out here.

22:46.974 --> 22:48.105
Middle of the ocean.

22:49.629 --> 22:50.978
No one can hear you scream.

22:56.070 --> 22:57.506
No, I'm not gonna kill you.

22:59.116 --> 23:01.380
Well, that is disappointing,

23:09.300 --> 23:11.041
But I am going
to leave you here.

23:15.089 --> 23:16.438
First you'll wake up alone.

23:17.570 --> 23:18.788
You'll realize I'm gone.

23:21.356 --> 23:23.053
You'll check your phone
but it's useless out here,

23:23.053 --> 23:24.011
so that won't help.

23:26.361 --> 23:28.015
No shipping lines out here.

23:29.886 --> 23:32.280
And the closest
land is miles away.

23:36.023 --> 23:38.329
You'll start to look for food.

23:38.329 --> 23:39.374
Good luck with that.

23:43.683 --> 23:47.774
It's funny, you're
surrounded by all this water.

23:48.862 --> 23:50.167
You can't drink any of it,

23:51.604 --> 23:54.998
so you'll start to
get really thirsty.

23:57.610 --> 23:59.438
You think it'd be painful,

23:59.438 --> 24:01.091
but after a while you
just start seeing things.

24:03.746 --> 24:06.183
I've actually heard
it's almost euphoric.

24:08.925 --> 24:10.710
I had to guess,

24:10.710 --> 24:13.495
I'd say you'll last maybe
three, four days at the most.

24:17.064 --> 24:19.240
You'll slowly fade
into obscurity

24:21.982 --> 24:23.418
and like all the other girls,

24:24.811 --> 24:26.247
no one's gonna come
looking for you.

24:28.945 --> 24:33.297
You'll cease to exist,
gradually rotting away

24:34.734 --> 24:36.953
as the sand crabs
eat your flesh.

24:49.879 --> 24:52.578
I like that.

24:54.580 --> 24:56.146
But you know there
is one fatal flaw

24:56.146 --> 24:57.670
to your diabolical plan.

24:59.889 --> 25:01.412
People would notice I'm gone.

25:05.329 --> 25:07.375
You sell products
to little girls.

25:09.116 --> 25:10.900
Do you really think they'd
come looking for you?

25:12.641 --> 25:15.426
I bet if I took over your
account, no one would notice.

25:16.863 --> 25:20.257
Honestly, that
would be a relief.

25:21.607 --> 25:22.912
But I'm pretty
sure they'd notice.

25:24.784 --> 25:27.961
Besides, I thought you
hated social media.

25:30.267 --> 25:31.530
Does it make you happy?

25:35.229 --> 25:36.709
Doesn't make me feel alone.

25:38.580 --> 25:41.452
But nobody actually cares.

25:43.280 --> 25:45.631
You feel entitled to thinking
that people should follow you,

25:46.762 --> 25:48.198
which makes you believe

25:48.198 --> 25:49.635
that you're the center
of the universe.

25:49.635 --> 25:52.725
The star of the
story, but no one is.

25:57.338 --> 26:01.734
Oh, we are 100% in my story.

26:42.209 --> 26:47.214
♪ The moon is
hiding on my side ♪

26:48.694 --> 26:53.176
♪ The night has
fallen on my right ♪

26:54.569 --> 26:59.356
♪ The car is drifting
on the brink ♪

27:00.836 --> 27:05.188
♪ My life could vanish
in a blink, and I say ♪

27:36.219 --> 27:37.873
Everything is so much better now

27:37.873 --> 27:39.701
that I've decided to stay.

27:43.487 --> 27:45.533
Thailand really speaks to me.

27:45.533 --> 27:47.840
It's such a rich,
vibrant country.

27:47.840 --> 27:50.538
Sometimes you just don't know
what a new place has to offer.

27:50.538 --> 27:54.716
You know, every day
feels so different.

27:54.716 --> 27:56.936
I like to get up around 5:30 AM.

27:56.936 --> 28:00.243
I'm able to get so much done
right off the top of the day.

28:00.243 --> 28:02.071
I've always been
a morning person.

28:02.071 --> 28:03.507
Early bird gets the worm.

28:05.335 --> 28:08.034
For breakfast, I tend to just
make something quick at home,

28:08.034 --> 28:09.949
a quick start to the day.

28:09.949 --> 28:12.386
I like to get a good head
start on work right away;

28:12.386 --> 28:13.909
emails, sponsors.

28:13.909 --> 28:16.346
I'll usually spend about
an hour doing this.

28:17.783 --> 28:19.219
I always try to
respond to my fans.

28:21.003 --> 28:23.876
If you let it, life can be
one surprise after another.

28:23.876 --> 28:26.400
You just have to let go
of your expectations.

28:49.597 --> 28:51.468
I think the most
important thing is to find

28:51.468 --> 28:54.471
the part of your day where
you can be really present.

28:54.471 --> 28:56.604
Often there's so
many distractions,

28:56.604 --> 28:58.084
so many things you can do.

28:58.084 --> 28:59.825
But every day you get a choice.

29:05.874 --> 29:08.442
Putting yourself into situations
that make you uncomfortable

29:08.442 --> 29:11.227
is the best way to
become a better person.

29:11.227 --> 29:13.360
Another thing I stand by
is I believe a healthy

29:13.360 --> 29:15.579
work life balance is
the key to living well.

29:16.972 --> 29:19.453
Everyone needs time
for themselves.

29:34.947 --> 29:37.210
Being authentic is the most
important thing you can do

29:37.210 --> 29:38.472
to make a better world.

29:39.865 --> 29:41.692
Getting out of the
grind of Western life

29:41.692 --> 29:43.694
has really opened up my
eyes to what living can be.

29:45.392 --> 29:47.568
It feels like for the
first time in a long while,

29:47.568 --> 29:49.744
I'm finally happy just being me.

29:57.926 --> 29:59.623
Hey guys, I'm
at the Big Buddha.

29:59.623 --> 30:00.624
It's incredible.

30:00.624 --> 30:02.409
I came to pay respects.

30:04.803 --> 30:07.457
Hey guys, I'm at the Big Buddha.

30:07.457 --> 30:09.111
It's incredible.

30:09.111 --> 30:13.550
I came to pay my respects.

30:30.785 --> 30:33.527
So far, it's
been practically perfect.

30:33.527 --> 30:35.181
Thanks again for
all the support.

30:36.922 --> 30:38.662
I was wondering if I could talk
to someone about increasing

30:38.662 --> 30:41.274
my credit limit.
- Yeah, of course.

30:41.274 --> 30:43.232
Hold for one second.

30:43.232 --> 30:46.061
I've decided to
take a break from social media.

30:46.061 --> 30:48.150
We all need a break sometimes.

30:48.150 --> 30:49.978
Not sure when I'll be back,

30:49.978 --> 30:52.198
but wanted to thank you
all for being there for me.

30:52.198 --> 30:55.288
I love you all.

35:21.423 --> 35:22.598
It's a fake.

35:23.904 --> 35:24.731
What?

35:25.819 --> 35:27.342
It's a fake.

35:27.342 --> 35:28.517
I know a place down the
road that has real jade

35:28.517 --> 35:29.823
and it'll be a better price.

35:29.823 --> 35:32.086
No, I know, it's not for me.

35:32.086 --> 35:34.306
It's just some
bullshit for my sister.

35:34.306 --> 35:35.872
She won't know the difference.

35:36.786 --> 35:37.613
Thanks.

37:19.759 --> 37:20.977
Are you following me?

37:22.675 --> 37:23.502
I'm kidding.

37:24.590 --> 37:25.721
I saw you at the store yesterday

37:25.721 --> 37:27.114
and now you're at my hotel.

37:27.114 --> 37:28.681
Right, from the shop.

37:28.681 --> 37:30.596
It's alright.

37:30.596 --> 37:32.815
Yesterday I realized why I
totally know who you are.

37:32.815 --> 37:35.731
It's because I follow you
and I'm such a huge fan

37:35.731 --> 37:37.559
and I felt like an idiot

37:37.559 --> 37:39.518
because of course you know
how to deal with these places

37:39.518 --> 37:41.433
and those things.

37:41.433 --> 37:43.261
That's probably something
that you do all the time.

37:43.261 --> 37:45.437
And the last thing I wanted
to do was offend you.

37:45.437 --> 37:47.047
I don't know why I
thought you needed help.

37:47.047 --> 37:49.267
And now I'm here at the
bar and I come up to you

37:49.267 --> 37:51.007
and I say this
stupid joke, and...

37:56.012 --> 37:57.405
Sorry.

37:57.405 --> 37:59.059
Have a good evening.

38:00.539 --> 38:01.409
You follow me?

38:05.457 --> 38:07.676
My boyfriend was supposed
to be here with me.

38:07.676 --> 38:09.504
We had this whole trip planned,

38:09.504 --> 38:13.291
but he bailed the last minute
and so we couldn't cancel

38:13.291 --> 38:15.510
and he convinced me to go alone.

38:15.510 --> 38:17.425
Well, what I always say
to my team of girls is,

38:17.425 --> 38:20.950
in order to grow you have to
be able to thrive on your own.

38:22.169 --> 38:23.170
You're right.

38:24.998 --> 38:27.740
I just, I think it's so cool
how you travel all the time.

38:27.740 --> 38:29.611
I could never do that.

38:29.611 --> 38:30.786
Of course you could.

38:30.786 --> 38:31.831
I mean it took me a little bit,

38:31.831 --> 38:33.920
but anyone can do it.

38:33.920 --> 38:36.749
Just, it's really hard
to meet people here.

38:36.749 --> 38:38.359
We have this huge villa booked

38:38.359 --> 38:40.840
overlooking the ocean
down on the islands.

38:40.840 --> 38:42.581
Just, it felt weird
being there alone,

38:42.581 --> 38:45.323
so I came here to be
around more people.

38:46.541 --> 38:47.803
Look where that got me.

38:49.588 --> 38:51.503
How big is this place?

38:51.503 --> 38:54.549
Way too big for just one
person, that's for sure.

39:01.513 --> 39:02.514
Okay, let me see.

39:08.084 --> 39:08.998
What do you think?

39:08.998 --> 39:09.825
What?

39:09.825 --> 39:11.000
Hat no hat?

39:12.828 --> 39:14.003
Definitely hat.

39:14.917 --> 39:16.702
Definitely hat.

39:16.702 --> 39:18.007
Definitely hat, she says.

39:22.098 --> 39:23.186
Okay, let me take a look.

39:23.186 --> 39:24.187
Let me take a look.

39:27.452 --> 39:28.714
That's great, oh,
that's great.

39:28.714 --> 39:29.758
These are cute.

39:29.758 --> 39:30.846
Yes, yes.

39:30.846 --> 39:31.891
Let's do a few more.

39:31.891 --> 39:33.980
Oh, I love this one.

39:33.980 --> 39:36.286
You were so right,
the hat totally works.

39:36.286 --> 39:37.287
These are so great.

39:37.287 --> 39:38.593
You're such a natural.

39:38.593 --> 39:40.290
Oh my God, stop it.

39:40.290 --> 39:41.466
You're too sweet.

39:41.466 --> 39:43.250
Oh, shit.

39:44.860 --> 39:46.122
Shit.

39:46.122 --> 39:47.123
What?

39:47.123 --> 39:48.647
I completely forgot.

39:48.647 --> 39:50.431
I'm gonna have to
bail for a bit.

39:50.431 --> 39:51.998
The sponsor has been
hounding me to go for dinner

39:51.998 --> 39:53.826
over the past couple
days and I promised

39:53.826 --> 39:56.045
I would check out some of their
products before we went out.

39:56.045 --> 39:57.569
Oh.

39:57.569 --> 39:58.744
Well, I would totally
bring you if I could,

39:58.744 --> 40:00.136
but you know how these ones are.

40:00.136 --> 40:02.095
Oh no, no, it's totally fine.

40:02.095 --> 40:04.140
I completely understand.

40:04.140 --> 40:05.881
I'm so sorry.

40:05.881 --> 40:07.492
But listen, there's this place

40:07.492 --> 40:09.058
that I've been
dying to show you.

40:09.058 --> 40:10.582
So let me meet up
with these guys

40:10.582 --> 40:11.670
and I'll call you
when I'm done, okay?

40:11.670 --> 40:13.106
Yeah, of course.

40:14.194 --> 40:15.413
Put on something nice.

41:59.429 --> 42:00.387
Jessica!

42:24.890 --> 42:25.978
Whose bike?

42:30.243 --> 42:31.157
Nice place.

42:34.247 --> 42:36.815
What's all this?

42:36.815 --> 42:38.904
Maybe your boyfriend
showed up after all.

42:57.357 --> 42:58.184
You made it.

43:00.882 --> 43:01.709
Hi.

43:03.102 --> 43:03.929
Who are you?

43:04.930 --> 43:06.584
Who are you?

43:06.584 --> 43:08.281
I'm Madison's boyfriend.

43:10.065 --> 43:11.937
Ryan.

43:11.937 --> 43:13.155
I thought you
said it was just you here.

43:13.155 --> 43:15.027
It was.

43:15.027 --> 43:17.420
I told my friend she could
stay here while I was gone.

43:17.420 --> 43:19.901
She told me she
broke up with you.

43:19.901 --> 43:21.860
Yeah, that sounds
like Madison.

43:21.860 --> 43:23.383
I'm gonna go find my room.

43:27.605 --> 43:29.955
She didn't tell me we
would have any visitors.

43:32.131 --> 43:33.436
Hope you see a surprise.

43:34.829 --> 43:36.657
You know, Madison
never mentioned to me

43:36.657 --> 43:37.963
that someone was staying here.

43:37.963 --> 43:39.312
This place is under her name.

43:39.312 --> 43:41.053
She insisted on it.

43:41.053 --> 43:42.620
I just would've
thought she'd mention it.

43:42.620 --> 43:44.360
I mean, I'm essentially
paying for this place.

43:46.536 --> 43:48.669
Is everything good?

43:48.669 --> 43:49.583
Yeah.

43:53.935 --> 43:58.287
Well, this obviously isn't
how I saw my night panning out.

43:59.332 --> 44:00.638
You guys seem lovely.

44:02.727 --> 44:05.164
Enjoy the food I guess.

44:05.164 --> 44:07.122
And let me know if you
get hold of Madison.

44:10.082 --> 44:11.649
Guess I'll take Madison's room.

44:20.745 --> 44:22.311
Hungry?

45:06.965 --> 45:08.793
Oh, look who it is, huh?

45:10.577 --> 45:13.058
Yo, Madison, finally.

45:13.058 --> 45:14.450
You're at my place.

45:14.450 --> 45:15.843
Yeah, I am.

45:15.843 --> 45:17.105
Where are you?

45:17.105 --> 45:18.585
I changed plans.

45:18.585 --> 45:19.629
You need to leave.

45:21.109 --> 45:22.850
You don't sound so good.

45:22.850 --> 45:23.851
You're making
this more difficult

45:23.851 --> 45:25.418
than it needs to be.

45:25.418 --> 45:27.246
I told you we broke up.

45:27.246 --> 45:28.377
Come on.

45:29.465 --> 45:30.945
You don't really mean that.

45:30.945 --> 45:32.686
How did you
find out where I live?

45:32.686 --> 45:34.340
I can
make it up to you.

45:36.995 --> 45:37.822
Mads.

45:39.345 --> 45:40.259
You need
to leave, it's over.

45:48.702 --> 45:50.443
I'm not doing
this over the phone.

45:50.443 --> 45:51.749
If you've got something to
say, you can say it to my face.

45:51.749 --> 45:52.619
Okay?

45:55.970 --> 45:56.971
She'll be back soon.

46:01.367 --> 46:02.977
I'm ready to go.

46:02.977 --> 46:04.500
Coming?

46:04.500 --> 46:06.459
Do you think we could
push a little later?

46:06.459 --> 46:07.547
I've just got this...

46:07.547 --> 46:09.027
I'll go.

46:09.027 --> 46:10.245
Yeah, I spent a
summer on the island

46:10.245 --> 46:12.247
so I know some cool spots.

46:12.247 --> 46:13.161
Great.

46:13.161 --> 46:14.380
Let's go.

46:14.380 --> 46:17.078
You know this can wait.

46:18.558 --> 46:19.602
- All right.
- Okay.

46:40.232 --> 46:41.059
Wow.

46:42.582 --> 46:44.323
Tilt the camera
a little this way.

46:44.323 --> 46:46.455
Just think the sun's
gonna hit me better here.

46:48.196 --> 46:49.023
Nice.

46:50.677 --> 46:51.634
So what's her deal?

46:53.027 --> 46:54.246
How long have you
two known each other?

46:54.246 --> 46:55.725
A few days ago.

46:56.857 --> 46:58.424
How much longer for the food?

46:58.424 --> 46:59.860
Anyone who knows Madison

46:59.860 --> 47:01.427
knows that she
wouldn't invite some

47:01.427 --> 47:02.428
stranger to come
and live with her.

47:02.428 --> 47:03.603
Said it was her place.

47:03.603 --> 47:05.257
Nothing makes sense, you know?

47:05.257 --> 47:06.693
Madison's room got broken into

47:06.693 --> 47:07.999
and all of her shit got taken.

47:07.999 --> 47:09.827
Her passport, everything.

47:09.827 --> 47:11.698
It's just weird, you know?

47:11.698 --> 47:13.743
One minute she can't wait
to come home and the next...

47:13.743 --> 47:17.573
Food's here!

47:26.931 --> 47:31.022
I'm starting to see why
Madison wanted to stay.

47:33.851 --> 47:35.461
What happened between you two?

47:37.245 --> 47:39.030
Honestly--

47:39.030 --> 47:41.293
We should probably get a move
on before we lose sunlight.

47:41.293 --> 47:43.121
It'll be a lot
harder to climb down.

47:44.949 --> 47:47.647
Yeah, we should make sure
our rooms weren't broken into.

47:53.566 --> 47:56.003
You'd be surprised how
often that happens here.

48:00.268 --> 48:03.358
You guys coming?

Hi.

49:41.674 --> 49:42.501
You're leaving.

49:44.285 --> 49:46.157
You're back.

49:46.157 --> 49:48.855
I guess neither of us could
stand partying with Ryan, huh?

49:49.987 --> 49:51.379
I found a hotel.

49:52.293 --> 49:53.860
This late at night?

49:53.860 --> 49:55.949
I just didn't wanna
put you out anymore.

49:55.949 --> 49:58.691
But thanks for everything.

49:58.691 --> 50:00.388
- I can drop you off.
- No, no.

50:00.388 --> 50:02.129
I have a taxi.

50:02.129 --> 50:03.957
I saw that on my way in.

50:03.957 --> 50:05.524
I paid him for you.

50:05.524 --> 50:07.482
I just thought he
didn't get his money.

50:11.486 --> 50:12.922
I told him to wait for me.

50:14.924 --> 50:16.013
You know what?

50:16.013 --> 50:17.492
It's okay.

50:17.492 --> 50:18.580
I'll call another one,
it's fine, really.

50:18.580 --> 50:19.668
Did I do something?

50:21.105 --> 50:22.889
Look, I don't
wanna get into it.

50:22.889 --> 50:24.717
Into what?

50:24.717 --> 50:26.719
I just think I would feel
better in my own space.

50:26.719 --> 50:27.720
You're safe here.

50:27.720 --> 50:29.243
I'm here, Ryan's here.

50:29.243 --> 50:31.724
Okay, Ryan said that
Madison's hotel room

50:31.724 --> 50:34.640
was broken into right before
she went traveling with you.

50:36.685 --> 50:39.036
Weren't you with her that night?

50:39.036 --> 50:40.472
What are you trying to say?

50:40.472 --> 50:42.126
I mean, that Ryan's right.

50:43.518 --> 50:46.869
I invited you into my home.

50:46.869 --> 50:48.828
Okay, you told me that
you booked this place

50:48.828 --> 50:50.177
with your boyfriend.

50:50.177 --> 50:52.092
You never said
anything about Madison.

50:52.092 --> 50:55.400
But now Ryan is saying that
this isn't even your place.

50:55.400 --> 50:56.923
It's under Madison's name.

50:58.968 --> 51:00.622
I think I know
what you're up to.

51:01.884 --> 51:03.103
And what's that?

51:03.103 --> 51:05.105
You're taking advantage of her

51:05.105 --> 51:07.194
and you're not
gonna do that to me.

51:07.194 --> 51:09.849
Madison is my friend.

51:09.849 --> 51:12.765
Look, it's money that
you want, just take some.

51:12.765 --> 51:14.288
It doesn't matter to me.

51:14.288 --> 51:15.855
You don't have to
pretend anymore.

51:19.206 --> 51:21.861
I don't even think the
two of you are friends.

51:21.861 --> 51:24.255
With us, you just
kind of stuck around.

51:24.255 --> 51:26.170
I've been weirded out
since the night we met,

51:26.170 --> 51:28.433
but I, I don't know, maybe
I should have just known.

51:30.435 --> 51:31.610
You're fucking creepy.

51:53.893 --> 51:56.287
You don't know
anything about me.

51:57.549 --> 51:59.377
I don't want your fucking money.

52:00.943 --> 52:04.164
You entitled bitch.

52:19.223 --> 52:22.226
I really wish we could have
finished what we started.

52:22.226 --> 52:25.794
Then you really would
have seen the truth.

52:32.497 --> 52:34.412
They won't even
notice you're gone.

52:35.543 --> 52:36.414
Please...

52:36.414 --> 52:37.415
Nobody cares.

52:44.509 --> 52:45.379
They never do.

53:15.366 --> 53:17.585
This is the chick I
was telling you about.

53:17.585 --> 53:19.239
She's so weird.

53:19.239 --> 53:22.590
I was so concerned about you.

53:22.590 --> 53:23.417
Looked everywhere for you.

53:23.417 --> 53:24.897
You just left?

53:26.594 --> 53:27.552
Jessica still here?

53:29.249 --> 53:30.816
She told me she was
checking into another hotel.

53:30.816 --> 53:32.121
She was too drunk.

53:32.121 --> 53:34.341

53:40.956 --> 53:42.697
It's pretty
fucking late, Ryan.

53:44.221 --> 53:46.005
And?

53:46.005 --> 53:48.007
Madison doesn't want you here
and you can't keep treating

53:48.007 --> 53:49.835

own goddamn place.

53:49.835 --> 53:52.490

56:54.106 --> 56:55.586

56:57.065 --> 56:59.067
Yeah, she had
to rush back home.

57:00.112 --> 57:01.679
Had some job.

57:01.679 --> 57:02.897
She didn't message you?

57:06.292 --> 57:07.511
I haven't checked my phone.

57:12.211 --> 57:13.212
This looks good.

57:14.735 --> 57:15.562
Thank you.

57:24.876 --> 57:27.487
You can stay until
Madison gets back.

57:27.487 --> 57:28.967
I won't say anything.

58:39.690 --> 58:42.431
Look at this, the whole
account's gone downhill.

58:48.133 --> 58:49.395
Look, I took this one.

58:50.875 --> 58:51.702
Cute.

58:53.442 --> 58:54.443
She needs me.

58:56.402 --> 58:58.883
I brought out who
she really was.

58:58.883 --> 59:00.711
Now she's just so fake.

59:00.711 --> 59:03.496
Well, maybe this
is who she really is.

59:03.496 --> 59:04.932
This ain't her.

59:08.022 --> 59:09.633
Ever since she
lost her passport.

59:11.112 --> 59:12.374
Well, it freed her to
do whatever she wants.

59:12.374 --> 59:14.202
And that's freedom?

59:14.202 --> 59:15.682
Dude, you gotta stop
being such a little bitch.

59:17.423 --> 59:20.252
You're in one of the most
beautiful places on the planet.

59:20.252 --> 59:22.646
I'd love if the guy came
halfway across the world

59:22.646 --> 59:23.560
to look for me.

59:26.171 --> 59:28.913
If she doesn't see that, then
maybe she's not worth it.

59:44.537 --> 59:48.019
I got her a rep, who
then got her branding deals.

59:48.019 --> 59:49.673
The first girl.

59:49.673 --> 59:52.240
She blows up
after this one video

59:52.240 --> 59:54.503
I got with this kid
called Oliver Left.

59:54.503 --> 59:55.940
Have you heard of him?

59:55.940 --> 59:57.376
It got like a million
views overnight.

59:57.376 --> 59:59.508
So she kind of
reminds me of Jessica.

59:59.508 --> 01:00:01.902
Honestly, Jessica's
got a bit of the spark.

01:00:01.902 --> 01:00:03.556
You know it when you see it.

01:00:04.775 --> 01:00:07.778
Some people just hold gravity.

01:00:09.388 --> 01:00:10.432
Madison's the same.

01:00:11.825 --> 01:00:13.087
Gravity.

01:00:13.087 --> 01:00:14.306
You know what I mean.

01:00:17.570 --> 01:00:19.093
You know, you'd do pretty well.

01:00:20.312 --> 01:00:22.096
I'm serious, you would.

01:00:23.794 --> 01:00:27.362
You're unique.

01:00:29.364 --> 01:00:31.889
People are all about
that these days.

01:00:33.281 --> 01:00:34.326
I could help you.

01:02:25.480 --> 01:02:30.485
What?

01:04:28.429 --> 01:04:29.256
Wake up.

01:04:35.567 --> 01:04:36.394
Morning.

01:04:41.486 --> 01:04:42.835
Quite the night.

01:04:51.104 --> 01:04:53.628
We should probably
get going soon.

01:04:53.628 --> 01:04:54.891
Don't have a ton of time.

01:04:56.718 --> 01:04:58.329
We've got like an hour left
before your ferry leaves.

01:05:32.580 --> 01:05:34.147
It sucks you have to go.

01:05:37.020 --> 01:05:37.890
Yeah.

01:05:39.500 --> 01:05:40.327
Get home safe.

01:05:42.547 --> 01:05:43.374
You too.

01:08:04.776 --> 01:08:05.603
Ryan?

01:08:08.475 --> 01:08:10.999
Hey, Madison, right?

01:08:15.613 --> 01:08:17.223
Someone else
was pretending to be you

01:08:17.223 --> 01:08:18.790
the whole time.

01:08:18.790 --> 01:08:20.313
Yes. I'm sorry.

01:08:20.313 --> 01:08:22.402
It was my friend Theon.

01:08:22.402 --> 01:08:23.577
I was passed out.

01:08:23.577 --> 01:08:25.405
I mean, we went out so late.

01:08:25.405 --> 01:08:26.580
I guess he thought it'd be funny

01:08:26.580 --> 01:08:28.365
to message girls on my account.

01:08:28.365 --> 01:08:31.716
Well good, 'cause I thought
you were complete idiot.

01:08:31.716 --> 01:08:34.284
Yeah,
you still came out.

01:08:34.284 --> 01:08:37.243
Maybe there's some charm to
someone who's kind of stupid.

01:08:38.853 --> 01:08:39.811
Harmless, right?

01:08:41.029 --> 01:08:41.856
Yeah.

01:08:43.249 --> 01:08:44.424
Maybe I can trust
that more than someone

01:08:44.424 --> 01:08:45.860
who's got something to hide.

01:08:51.431 --> 01:08:53.129
Is there any game
you're not good at?

01:08:58.046 --> 01:08:59.396
Rematch?

01:08:59.396 --> 01:09:00.266
Smile.

01:09:02.138 --> 01:09:03.008
And the bear.

01:09:08.013 --> 01:09:09.884
That's actually really nice.

01:09:09.884 --> 01:09:12.626
Why do
you sound surprised?

01:09:14.062 --> 01:09:17.544
I'll text it to you.

01:09:17.544 --> 01:09:20.156
So you don't really
post that much, do you?

01:09:21.374 --> 01:09:23.985
Um, thank you?

01:09:23.985 --> 01:09:26.858
No, I just mean, you know,
if you took that photo,

01:09:26.858 --> 01:09:29.382
used a couple of
proper hashtags,

01:09:29.382 --> 01:09:31.819
I think you could tap into
a pretty huge following.

01:09:31.819 --> 01:09:33.343
That photo.

01:09:33.343 --> 01:09:35.388
I think people would
find you refreshing.

01:09:35.388 --> 01:09:36.259
I do.

01:09:38.217 --> 01:09:40.263
I don't know,
sounds like work.

01:09:41.786 --> 01:09:43.091
Could be a lot of money.

01:09:44.963 --> 01:09:45.964
I'm serious.

01:09:48.009 --> 01:09:49.141
You know what?

01:09:50.403 --> 01:09:51.230
I could help.

01:09:52.753 --> 01:09:55.147
Is this just some
ploy to see me again?

01:09:57.758 --> 01:09:59.151
Yes.

01:09:59.151 --> 01:10:00.108
You got me.

01:10:02.589 --> 01:10:04.112
Let me see that photo again.

01:10:26.526 --> 01:10:29.268
My girlfriend is staying here.

01:10:29.268 --> 01:10:30.226
Have you seen her?

01:10:31.314 --> 01:10:32.445
No.

01:10:32.445 --> 01:10:33.316
Are you sure?

01:10:51.856 --> 01:10:54.859
Good lord young man,
who broke your heart?

01:10:56.339 --> 01:10:57.862
Another drink for
this poor soul.

01:11:00.604 --> 01:11:04.172
So, why not tell Uncle
Rupert all about her?

01:11:04.172 --> 01:11:06.784
Believe me, you don't
get divorced three times

01:11:06.784 --> 01:11:10.396
and not get to notice
a, a certain look.

01:11:14.835 --> 01:11:16.750
You haven't seen
this girl, have you?

01:11:19.753 --> 01:11:21.625
I might have.

01:11:21.625 --> 01:11:23.888
I mean after a while they all
start looking a bit the same.

01:11:23.888 --> 01:11:26.630
There's no shortage
of women around here.

01:11:28.284 --> 01:11:29.110
Sorry.

01:11:31.635 --> 01:11:34.290
Her room was broken
into a few weeks ago.

01:11:36.117 --> 01:11:38.206
I just can't see why
she would come back.

01:11:40.470 --> 01:11:41.732
No, I do remember.

01:11:43.211 --> 01:11:45.431
Yeah, she made quite
a fuss apparently.

01:11:45.431 --> 01:11:46.998
Left the next day.

01:11:46.998 --> 01:11:48.521
Haven't seen them since.

01:11:50.567 --> 01:11:52.090
Them?

01:11:52.090 --> 01:11:55.963
Yes, she was with a
girl with a birth mark.

01:11:58.575 --> 01:12:00.141
Apparently she was
here a few days ago.

01:12:00.141 --> 01:12:01.317
No.

01:12:01.317 --> 01:12:02.883
This was posted yesterday.

01:12:02.883 --> 01:12:05.451
No way, look, not
a cloud in the sky.

01:12:05.451 --> 01:12:07.018
We're in the rainy season now.

01:12:07.018 --> 01:12:09.934
First sunny day
we've had for weeks.

01:12:14.025 --> 01:12:14.895
Who's the fellow?

01:12:21.249 --> 01:12:22.163
Ryan?

01:12:22.163 --> 01:12:23.730
What time is it?

01:12:23.730 --> 01:12:26.167
When did you last
speak to Madison?

01:12:26.167 --> 01:12:27.691
Maybe a week ago.

01:12:27.691 --> 01:12:28.866
Video chat, did
you video chat?

01:12:28.866 --> 01:12:30.868
Wait, where are you?

01:12:30.868 --> 01:12:34.175
No, you didn't.

01:12:34.175 --> 01:12:35.960
Ryan, we have not video
chatted in a while.

01:12:35.960 --> 01:12:38.310
Just text what's going on.

01:12:38.310 --> 01:12:42.445
I've spoken to Madison
but I haven't seen her.

01:12:44.447 --> 01:12:46.013
It kind of seems
like no one has.

01:12:46.013 --> 01:12:47.885
Is this
about her post?

01:12:47.885 --> 01:12:49.452
I mean, do you really believe

01:12:49.452 --> 01:12:51.018
that "new love of
my life" bullshit?

01:12:51.018 --> 01:12:53.543
She didn't even tell
me she met a guy.

01:12:58.025 --> 01:12:59.244
She never mentioned him.

01:13:01.028 --> 01:13:02.856
She definitely would've
told me about a cute guy

01:13:02.856 --> 01:13:03.727
she had met.

01:13:05.381 --> 01:13:07.208
I have to go.

01:13:07.208 --> 01:13:09.863
Ryan, you can do a whole
lot better than Madison.

01:13:19.351 --> 01:13:21.614
Hey guys, I'm here
at the Big Buddha.

01:13:21.614 --> 01:13:22.833
It's incredible.

01:13:22.833 --> 01:13:24.400
I came to pay my respects.

01:13:27.794 --> 01:13:30.057
Hey guys, I'm here
at the Big Buddha.

01:13:30.057 --> 01:13:31.276
It's incredible.

01:13:31.276 --> 01:13:32.799
I came to pay my respects.

01:13:34.322 --> 01:13:36.455
Hey guys, I'm here
at the Big Buddha.

01:13:36.455 --> 01:13:37.717
It's incredible.

01:13:37.717 --> 01:13:39.240
I came to pay my respects.

01:13:40.720 --> 01:13:42.374
Hey guys, I'm here
at the Big Buddha.

01:13:42.374 --> 01:13:43.506
It's incredible.

01:13:43.506 --> 01:13:44.768
I came to pay my re--

01:16:55.436 --> 01:16:58.048
You know I've blacked
out a couple of times.

01:16:58.048 --> 01:17:03.096
I drink, so it happens.

01:17:05.185 --> 01:17:07.623
But I never forget a shag.

01:17:07.623 --> 01:17:09.059
What is going on?

01:17:12.279 --> 01:17:13.280
Oh my god.

01:17:13.280 --> 01:17:14.151
Where is she?

01:17:17.458 --> 01:17:18.416
I don't understand.

01:17:18.416 --> 01:17:19.678
You can drop the act.

01:17:21.898 --> 01:17:25.249
"CW brought me to
this wonderful island.

01:17:25.249 --> 01:17:26.903
"There's no phone service here.

01:17:28.426 --> 01:17:31.559
"Normally I'd hate this,
but it feels so freeing.

01:17:32.996 --> 01:17:34.824
"I almost don't
want to go back."

01:17:38.523 --> 01:17:39.742
You know, at first I
thought you were doing this

01:17:39.742 --> 01:17:41.308
just to take advantage of her.

01:17:42.570 --> 01:17:44.529
You want to use her house?

01:17:44.529 --> 01:17:45.704
It's a nice house.

01:17:46.749 --> 01:17:47.706
Use her stuff.

01:17:49.316 --> 01:17:52.015
But that's not what
this is about, is it?

01:17:52.015 --> 01:17:54.191
And honestly, I'm appalled.

01:17:54.191 --> 01:17:56.062
I would've thought
someone like you would do

01:17:56.062 --> 01:17:59.675
a much better job of frankly
basic security questions.

01:18:00.893 --> 01:18:02.329
- You don't know shit.
- I do.

01:18:04.636 --> 01:18:05.463
I've seen it.

01:18:06.943 --> 01:18:09.772
I mean, fair play,
you've got money.

01:18:11.730 --> 01:18:14.167
You're so much worse since
she made you out to be.

01:18:14.167 --> 01:18:15.255
Are you lonely?

01:18:16.343 --> 01:18:17.867
Is that it?

01:18:17.867 --> 01:18:19.346
I wondered how you
got into the house.

01:18:19.346 --> 01:18:21.435
Thought it was pretty
fucking creepy.

01:18:21.435 --> 01:18:24.221
Do you track all of her
purchases or just the big ones?

01:18:24.221 --> 01:18:25.744
Are you really
doing this because

01:18:25.744 --> 01:18:27.354
you don't have any
friends of your own?

01:18:28.791 --> 01:18:31.445
You have to use my
girlfriend's account

01:18:31.445 --> 01:18:35.014
so that you can
feel what, liked?

01:18:39.018 --> 01:18:41.281
How long have you been
keeping tabs on her?

01:18:44.328 --> 01:18:46.765
That's some next level
psycho shit, Ryan.

01:18:47.984 --> 01:18:49.420
Where is she?

01:18:49.420 --> 01:18:50.900
I'll call the police right now.

01:18:50.900 --> 01:18:52.031
And tell them what?

01:18:53.816 --> 01:18:58.734
That you beat a woman and
tied her up on a whim?

01:19:00.126 --> 01:19:01.780
That she what, took
your girlfriend?

01:19:01.780 --> 01:19:03.739
Do you not get it?

01:19:03.739 --> 01:19:04.957
I've got everything.

01:19:04.957 --> 01:19:06.742
Madison showed
me the messages.

01:19:08.700 --> 01:19:11.834
She said that you hit
her several times.

01:19:12.965 --> 01:19:15.272
You sent those.

01:19:15.272 --> 01:19:17.361
Who do you think
they're gonna believe?

01:19:19.232 --> 01:19:21.844
I think you've got yourself
in a little corner here.

01:19:22.845 --> 01:19:23.802
Tying up a woman.

01:19:25.325 --> 01:19:26.762
I think this is gonna bruise.

01:19:43.953 --> 01:19:47.086
What did you do
with my girlfriend?

01:19:49.393 --> 01:19:52.265
I didn't do anything,

01:19:58.750 --> 01:20:00.186
but I can take you to her.

01:20:05.801 --> 01:20:06.802
Where are we going?

01:20:08.716 --> 01:20:09.543
Oi!

01:20:10.936 --> 01:20:15.680
It's just up here.

01:20:33.698 --> 01:20:38.703
What--

01:23:30.570 --> 01:23:32.311
Hi, guys.

01:23:32.311 --> 01:23:36.446
I just want to say that I
always knew Ryan was a predator.

01:23:36.446 --> 01:23:40.450
I never trusted him.
