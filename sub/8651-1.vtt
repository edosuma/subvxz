Bless me, Father,
for I have sinned.

00:27.027 --> 00:31.132
How are you doing?

00:31.199 --> 00:33.801
It's been two weeks
since my last confession.

00:33.867 --> 00:37.538
I've done a lot of bad things
in that time.

00:37.605 --> 00:39.840
Didn't go to church,

00:39.907 --> 00:44.145
I took the Lord's name in vain
quite a few times,

00:44.212 --> 00:46.914
I cursed my mother-in-law,

00:46.980 --> 00:50.318
but it was in Italian,
so she couldn't understand,

00:50.384 --> 00:51.719
so I don't know
if that counts.

00:51.785 --> 00:52.820
It counts.

00:52.886 --> 00:54.522
Okay...

00:54.588 --> 00:57.591
And I cheated on my wife.

00:57.658 --> 00:59.927
You committed adultery?

00:59.993 --> 01:00.994
Yes.

01:01.061 --> 01:02.496
How many times?

01:03.964 --> 01:08.136
Five times the last two weeks.

01:08.202 --> 01:09.270
Wait...

01:09.337 --> 01:13.241
No, that's wrong.

01:13.307 --> 01:18.712
It was four times this week...

01:18.779 --> 01:21.115
with three women...

01:21.182 --> 01:24.685
and three times last week...

01:24.752 --> 01:26.287
with two other women.

01:26.354 --> 01:27.488
Wow.

01:27.555 --> 01:29.523
Plus, one of the women
from this week

01:29.590 --> 01:31.392
was the same as last week...

01:31.459 --> 01:34.528
or maybe two of the women
was the same,

01:34.595 --> 01:37.064
so I guess that makes...

01:37.131 --> 01:38.966
What? I don't know.
Seven times.

01:39.032 --> 01:42.336
I mean, it was more than
seven times, Father.

01:42.403 --> 01:47.107
It was more like 10 or 12
times, but, you know,
it was like...

01:47.175 --> 01:50.811
on seven different occasions,
only with five different
women,

01:50.878 --> 01:56.317
but some of the women
more than once...

01:57.851 --> 02:00.388
Some of them quite a
few times.

02:00.454 --> 02:02.923
In fact,
it's hard to say, Father.

02:02.990 --> 02:05.159
I didn't exactly keep count,

02:05.226 --> 02:08.496
but let's say a dozen times
in the last two weeks...

50:22.887 --> 50:24.722
Did you shoot him
or not?

50:24.789 --> 50:26.624
I think so.

50:26.691 --> 50:28.626
What do you mean?
I heard a shot.

50:28.693 --> 50:32.197
I shot him, but I don't know
if I hit him.

50:32.263 --> 50:33.864
I mean, I turned my head away
at the last second.

50:33.931 --> 50:34.832
I'm sorry,

50:34.899 --> 50:36.167
but I couldn't
bear to watch.

50:36.234 --> 50:37.735
I thought you knew about guns.

50:37.802 --> 50:40.405
I never shot anyone before.

50:40.471 --> 50:42.473
Oh, don't worry.
I understand.

50:42.540 --> 50:44.209
There's a first time
for everything.

50:44.275 --> 50:46.377
I read about
a dental hygienist--

Mama, never mind.

50:51.416 --> 50:52.783
Oh, wait.
There's some blood.

50:52.850 --> 50:56.053
Let me see.

50:56.121 --> 50:57.688
What is it?

50:57.755 --> 51:00.458
I think it's a bullet hole.
It's very small.

51:00.525 --> 51:04.129
A bullet hole?
Are you sure?

51:04.195 --> 51:05.396
Yes, I'm sure.

My stomach don't feel
so hot neither.

That's all,

51:28.786 --> 51:31.189
Dr. Lowe was here.

51:31.256 --> 51:32.657
He was?

51:32.723 --> 51:34.125
Yeah.

51:34.192 --> 51:35.560
I don't remember.

51:35.626 --> 51:39.164
Yeah, he was here,
and he gave you a shot.

Can I get
a glass of water?

a couple of aspirin too.

going to do?

You're going to have
to shoot him again.

52:08.293 --> 52:09.727
No. I can't.

52:09.794 --> 52:12.062
I can't believe I did it
the first time.

52:12.129 --> 52:17.368
I can't believe
you let me do that.

52:17.435 --> 52:18.636
If you can't do it,

52:18.703 --> 52:19.704
you have to find
someone who can.

52:19.770 --> 52:21.506
I'll put up
the money.

52:46.831 --> 52:51.168
As much

Yeah, not too much,

54:27.698 --> 54:29.634
All you have to do
is finish him off.

54:29.700 --> 54:32.236

Joey very sick.

some other time.

we'll come back

Hey, Larry, how you doing?

01:16:05.995 --> 01:16:07.964
You all right?

01:16:08.031 --> 01:16:10.099
I got a little virus.

01:16:10.166 --> 01:16:11.267
A virus?

01:16:11.334 --> 01:16:13.703
Yes, some kind
of virus.

01:16:13.770 --> 01:16:16.372
I got a headache.

01:16:16.439 --> 01:16:18.441
You mind if I turn
on the light?

01:16:18.507 --> 01:16:20.944
Sure. Go ahead.

01:17:03.720 --> 01:17:05.822
No wonder
he has headache.

He's got a bullet in him.

over here right away.

He was lying there.

him to the hospital?

01:17:51.600 --> 01:17:52.668
He didn't want to go.

Devo shot him the first time.

have been there

I wanted to kill Joey.
Devo had nothing to
do with it.

Did Devo shoot him or not?

Never mind him.
What do you say?

01:19:08.778 --> 01:19:11.547
It wasn't Devo. It was me.

I shot him the first time,
and then...

01:19:15.819 --> 01:19:18.454
Who shot him? Let me see.
It was Marlon.

No, no. Harlan. Harlan.

Are you sure?

01:19:22.792 --> 01:19:26.095
Yeah, I'm sure.
Why? Who do you think
shot him?

01:19:26.162 --> 01:19:27.263
What about your mother?

01:19:27.330 --> 01:19:30.266
She had nothing to do with it.
Nothing.

01:19:30.333 --> 01:19:33.136
Yes, I shoot him. Yes.

Who gave him the pills?

01:19:38.041 --> 01:19:39.608
I did.
What do you think?

01:19:39.675 --> 01:19:40.944
First I give him
sleeping pills,

01:19:41.010 --> 01:19:42.011
then I shoot him.

And while you were doing this,
what was your daughter doing?

He's saying that his brother
is a patriotic American.
