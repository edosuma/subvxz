14:15.125 --> 14:17.959
HIS LOVER.

14:17.959 --> 14:20.750
WHAT IF YOU COULDN'T SEE WHAT
WAS RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOUR EYES?

14:20.750 --> 14:22.834
WHAT DOES
THAT SAY ABOUT YOU?

14:22.834 --> 14:28.166
- I SWEAR TO GOD, DEXTER,
I'M GONNA NAIL YOU TO THE WALL

14:28.166 --> 14:29.166
FOR WHAT YOU'VE DONE.

14:29.166 --> 14:30.750
- MARIA.
- TO THE WALL!

14:30.750 --> 14:32.333
- MARIA, THAT'S ENOUGH.

14:32.333 --> 14:35.667
- GOD DAMN IT, LIEUTENANT.
YOU CAN'T BE IN HERE.

14:35.667 --> 14:36.709
- TELL THEM
WHAT YOU JUST TOLD ME.

14:36.709 --> 14:38.792
- I RE-RAN THE BLOOD
ON THE SHIRT

14:38.792 --> 14:40.834
THAT CAPTAIN LAGUERTA
DISCOVERED IN THE TRASH.

14:40.834 --> 14:43.208
IT'S DEFINITELY
HECTOR ESTRADA'S,

14:43.208 --> 14:46.875
BUT AFTER GOING OVER IT,
I FOUND AN EVIDENCE NUMBER.

14:46.875 --> 14:49.417
- WHAT--
WHAT EVIDENCE NUMBER?

14:49.417 --> 14:50.875
- THE SHIRT YOU GAVE ME
WITH ESTRADA'S BLOOD ON IT

14:50.875 --> 14:53.250
IS THE SHIRT HE WAS WEARING
THE DAY HE WAS BROUGHT IN,

14:53.250 --> 14:54.667
BACK IN '73.

14:54.667 --> 14:56.458
THINGS GOT A LITTLE ROUGH,

14:56.458 --> 14:59.000
AND THE ARRESTING OFFICERS
BROKE HIS NOSE.

14:59.000 --> 15:01.333
- THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

15:01.333 --> 15:03.083
- I CHECKED INVENTORY.

15:03.083 --> 15:05.375
THE SHIRT'S MISSING.

15:05.375 --> 15:06.875
- WHAT ABOUT HIS WALLET?

15:06.875 --> 15:08.375
- PLEASE DON'T
KILL THE MESSENGER.

15:08.375 --> 15:10.291
THERE WAS A PARTIAL PRINT.

15:10.291 --> 15:12.792
AND IT'S YOURS.

15:12.792 --> 15:13.875
- WERE YOU TRYING
TO FRAME MY BROTHER?

15:13.875 --> 15:15.375
- DEB.

15:15.375 --> 15:17.625
- YOU SON OF A BITCH.
YOU SET ME UP.

15:17.625 --> 15:18.750
- MARIA.

15:18.750 --> 15:21.333
- CAN I GO NOW?
- YES, YOU CAN.

15:21.333 --> 15:24.208
- HE DID THIS!

15:24.208 --> 15:26.417
HE'S THE BAY HARBOR BUTCHER!
HE HAS TO BE.

15:26.417 --> 15:28.250
- THIS WITCH HUNT OF YOURS
IS FUCKING OVER.

15:28.250 --> 15:30.333
AND IF YOU HAVE A PROBLEM
WITH IT, CAPTAIN,

15:30.333 --> 15:33.208
WE CAN TAKE IT UPSTAIRS.

15:43.917 --> 15:45.417
- CAPTAIN.

15:45.417 --> 15:47.083
- EVERYONE ELSE
MAY HAVE BOUGHT

15:47.083 --> 15:49.750
YOUR LITTLE VICTIM ROUTINE
IN THERE,

15:49.750 --> 15:51.959
BUT WE BOTH KNOW THE TRUTH.

15:51.959 --> 15:55.667
- AND THE TRUTH IS
IT'S BEEN A VERY LONG DAY.

15:55.667 --> 15:59.208
- YOU SET ME UP,
JUST LIKE YOU DID JAMES.

15:59.208 --> 16:03.250
AND I'M SURE YOU'VE ALREADY
MANAGED TO KILL ESTRADA,

16:03.250 --> 16:05.458
WHICH LEAVES ME NO CHANCE
TO PROVE ANY OF THIS.

16:05.458 --> 16:07.458
CONGRATULATIONS.

16:07.458 --> 16:08.625
YOU'VE WON AGAIN.

16:08.625 --> 16:13.125
- I JUST WANNA GO HOME
AND SEE MY SON.

16:13.125 --> 16:17.125
- JAMES ALWAYS KNEW THERE WAS
SOMETHING WRONG WITH YOU.

16:18.792 --> 16:21.750
- SURPRISE, MOTHERFUCKER.

16:21.750 --> 16:24.500
YOU GOT MY REPORTS?
- HOT OFF THE PRESSES.

16:24.500 --> 16:26.959
- HEADLINES.

16:26.959 --> 16:29.500
- 26 STAB WOUNDS.
THE FIRST PIERCED HER HEART.

16:29.500 --> 16:32.750
WHOEVER DID THIS--
- WAS MAKING A FUCKING POINT.

16:32.750 --> 16:36.083
THIS IS OUR THIRD VIC.
- ANY SUSPECTS?

16:36.083 --> 16:39.083
- WALTER MUNRO.
FUCKER'S CRAZY.

16:39.083 --> 16:40.625
THINKS HE'S SOME KIND
OF PHILOSOPHER OR SOME SHIT.

16:40.625 --> 16:43.125
ALWAYS SCRIBBLING HIS FUCKED UP
THOUGHTS IN HIS JOURNALS.

16:43.125 --> 16:45.125
- HMM, THE VICTIMS
ARE ALL PROSTITUTES.

16:45.125 --> 16:46.959
THE WOUNDS SUGGEST
THE SAME WEAPON.

16:46.959 --> 16:48.625
IT IS CONSISTENT
WITH A SINGLE KILLER.

16:48.625 --> 16:51.250
- THE THING IS, HE'S CRAZY,
BUT HE'S SMART TOO.

16:51.250 --> 16:54.166
I CAN NEVER GET
ANYTHING ON HIM.

16:57.500 --> 17:01.208
HOLD UP.

17:04.375 --> 17:06.166
SUP?

17:06.166 --> 17:11.417
- WHAT WE...TALKED ABOUT.

17:11.417 --> 17:13.625
- COME ON, MARIA.

17:13.625 --> 17:14.792
DON'T YOU AT LEAST
WANNA THINK ABOUT IT?

17:14.792 --> 17:18.875
- I'M SORRY, JAMES.

17:22.542 --> 17:24.041
- OH, SHIT, MORGAN.

17:24.041 --> 17:26.542
I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
YOU WERE THERE.

17:26.542 --> 17:29.417
YOU'RE, LIKE, INVISIBLE.

17:32.375 --> 17:35.625
IF ONLY I HAD
STAYED INVISIBLE.

17:35.625 --> 17:38.542
- MARIA, WAIT UP.

17:38.542 --> 17:40.458
- ANGEL.

17:40.458 --> 17:41.875
- HEY.
- I-I DON'T WANNA HEAR IT.

17:41.875 --> 17:45.041
- I JUST CHECKED WITH
ESTRADA'S PAROLE OFFICER.

17:45.041 --> 17:47.667
YOU WERE BEHIND
HIS RELEASE FROM PRISON?

17:47.667 --> 17:51.542
- SOMEHOW, DEXTER FIGURED OUT
I WAS WATCHING HIM.

17:51.542 --> 17:55.375
- [speaks Spanish]

17:55.375 --> 17:58.750
EVERYONE THINKS THAT YOU'RE
TRYING TO FRAME DEXTER.

17:58.750 --> 18:00.208
- I--
- DEXTER.

18:00.208 --> 18:01.458
- I DON'T CARE
WHAT EVERYBODY ELSE THINKS.

18:01.458 --> 18:03.458
- WELL, YOU BETTER
START CARING.

18:03.458 --> 18:04.875
DO YOU WANT
TO KEEP YOUR JOB?

18:04.875 --> 18:07.000
- OF COURSE
I WANT TO KEEP MY JOB.

18:07.000 --> 18:08.041
- WELL THEN,
YOU BETTER BACK OFF

18:08.041 --> 18:09.834
AND DROP THIS
WHOLE CRAZY IDEA.

18:09.834 --> 18:13.375
- ANGEL, I--I NEED YOU
TO BE ON MY SIDE.

18:13.375 --> 18:16.458
- I AM ON YOUR SIDE AND
THAT'S WHY I'M TELLING YOU THIS.

18:16.458 --> 18:19.375
BUT YOU HAVE TO STOP.

18:27.166 --> 18:29.583
- OKAY, IT LOOKS PRETTY BAD,
DOESN'T IT?

18:29.583 --> 18:30.625
- MORE THAN PRETTY BAD.

18:30.625 --> 18:31.917
AND YOU'RE GONNA
HAVE TO WORK

18:31.917 --> 18:33.542
REALLY HARD TO FIX THIS.

18:33.542 --> 18:35.709
BUT COME ON, MARIA.

18:35.709 --> 18:41.125
IF ANYONE CAN WORK THEIR WAY OUT
OF A JAM LIKE THIS, IT'S YOU.

18:44.792 --> 18:49.750
- THANKS FOR YOUR
ADVICE, ANGEL.

18:49.750 --> 18:52.959
[knocks on door]

18:52.959 --> 18:54.792
- WE NEED TO TALK.

18:54.792 --> 18:59.291
- HARRISON JUST WENT TO SLEEP.

18:59.291 --> 19:02.333
- I'M GLAD ONE OF US
WILL SLEEP TONIGHT.

19:05.166 --> 19:06.875
HOW ABOUT A HEADS UP
THE NEXT TIME

19:06.875 --> 19:08.417
YOU'RE GONNA
GET YOURSELF ARRESTED?

19:08.417 --> 19:10.792
OR MAKE OUR CAPTAIN
LOOK LIKE A FUCKING LUNATIC.

19:10.792 --> 19:12.417
- IT WORKED, DIDN'T IT?

19:12.417 --> 19:14.625
EVERYONE THINKS
LAGUERTA FRAMED ME.

19:14.625 --> 19:16.792
SHE WON'T BE ABLE
TO COME AFTER ME ANYMORE.

19:16.792 --> 19:19.125
- AND ALL IT COST HER
WAS HER CAREER.

19:19.125 --> 19:22.083
- HOW MANY CAREERS
HAS LAGUERTA DESTROYED?

19:22.083 --> 19:24.250
- IT STILL DOESN'T
MAKE IT RIGHT.

19:24.250 --> 19:28.291
NOT THAT I EVEN KNOW
WHAT THAT IS ANYMORE.

19:32.375 --> 19:37.333
- I WISH IT HADN'T COME TO THIS,
BUT IT WAS EITHER HER OR ME.

19:37.333 --> 19:39.208
SHE ALMOST CAUGHT ME
TRYING TO KILL ESTRADA

19:39.208 --> 19:40.917
IN THAT SHIPPING CONTAINER
ON THE DOCKS.

19:40.917 --> 19:43.166
- WHOSE FAULT WAS THAT?

19:43.166 --> 19:44.875
- LAGUERTA'S THE ONE
WHO SET ME UP.

19:44.875 --> 19:46.417
- SO YOU REPAY THE FAVOR?

19:46.417 --> 19:50.291
- WOULD YOU PREFER MY NORMAL
METHOD OF CONFLICT RESOLUTION?

19:50.291 --> 19:51.834
- NOT FUCKING FUNNY.

19:51.834 --> 19:53.709
- LOOK, THERE WAS A PROBLEM
AND I SOLVED IT

19:53.709 --> 19:56.959
THE BEST WAY I KNEW HOW.
AND IT'S OVER.

19:56.959 --> 19:58.458
- THAT'S WHAT YOU KEEP SAYING.

19:58.458 --> 20:00.417
BUT WHAT ABOUT HANNAH?

20:00.417 --> 20:02.375
- WHAT ABOUT HER?

20:02.375 --> 20:05.583
- WELL, I ASSUME SHE KNOWS
WHAT YOU ARE.

20:05.583 --> 20:07.000
- YEAH, BUT--

20:07.000 --> 20:08.417
- WELL,
HER ARRAIGNMENT'S TOMORROW.

20:08.417 --> 20:09.667
HOW DO YOU KNOW
SHE WON'T USE THAT

20:09.667 --> 20:11.500
AS A BARGAINING CHIP
TO GET A BETTER DEAL?

20:11.500 --> 20:14.083
- SHE WON'T.
- HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT.

20:14.083 --> 20:18.250
- 'CAUSE SHE'S
IN LOVE WITH ME.

20:20.083 --> 20:22.333
- PRAY TO FUCK
YOU'RE RIGHT.

20:26.083 --> 20:28.875
TAKE TOMORROW OFF,
ALL RIGHT?

20:28.875 --> 20:32.875
AT LEAST UNTIL THE DUST SETTLES
WITH THIS LAGUERTA THING.

20:40.500 --> 20:42.417
- YOU KNOW THIS ISN'T OVER.

20:42.417 --> 20:45.750
DESPITE WHAT LAGUERTA THINKS,
ESTRADA'S STILL OUT THERE.

20:45.750 --> 20:47.125
- YEAH, I KNOW.

20:47.125 --> 20:48.750
IT'S BEEN SIX DAYS
SINCE I LET HIM GO.

20:48.750 --> 20:50.375
I HAVEN'T FOUND HIM YET.

20:50.375 --> 20:52.917
- IF HE RESURFACES
AND LAGUERTA GETS WIND OF IT--

20:52.917 --> 20:54.041
- SHE'LL OFFER HIM A DEAL.

20:54.041 --> 20:56.125
PUT HIM UP
IN SOME SAFE HOUSE.

20:56.125 --> 20:58.083
- AND YOU'RE LEFT
HAVING TO EXPLAIN TO THE D.A.

20:58.083 --> 20:59.709
WHY YOU CAME AFTER HIM
WITH A CHAINSAW.

20:59.709 --> 21:03.000
- I'LL FIND HIM.

21:03.000 --> 21:06.208
I'LL DO WHAT I HAVE TO DO.

21:06.208 --> 21:09.375
- YOU SOUND LIKE HANNAH.

21:20.250 --> 21:21.834
- ACCORDING TO
ESTRADA'S PAROLE OFFICER

21:21.834 --> 21:24.208
THIS IS THE LAST KNOWN
ADDRESS OF HIS WIFE.

21:24.208 --> 21:26.083
HECTOR HAS
NOWHERE ELSE TO TURN.

21:26.083 --> 21:29.291
HE'S WANTED
BY THE POLICE, ME...

21:35.250 --> 21:40.917
MRS. ESTRADA, I'M ARTHUR CURRY,
HECTOR'S PAROLE OFFICER.

21:40.917 --> 21:41.959
- WHY ARE YOU HERE?

21:41.959 --> 21:43.625
- I HAVEN'T SEEN
HECTOR IN YEARS.

21:43.625 --> 21:46.583
- HEY, HONEY, WHO'S THAT?
- THE NEIGHBOR.

21:46.583 --> 21:50.125
PLEASE, DON'T COME HERE AGAIN.

21:50.125 --> 21:52.125
MY TONY DOESN'T LIKE IT.

21:52.125 --> 21:53.834
- WELL, IF YOU HAVEN'T
SEEN HECTOR,

21:53.834 --> 21:56.750
WHY ARE YOU
STILL MARRIED TO HIM?

21:56.750 --> 21:58.834
- I'M CATHOLIC.

21:58.834 --> 22:01.208
- IS IT THAT GUY AGAIN?

22:01.208 --> 22:02.750
- YOU SURE
HE HASN'T BEEN AROUND?

22:02.750 --> 22:05.834
- YOU SHOULD GO.

22:14.041 --> 22:15.667
- IT'S BEEN 40 YEARS,

22:15.667 --> 22:18.333
BUT FLORENCIA
HASN'T LET GO OF HECTOR.

22:18.333 --> 22:22.709
SOMETIMES IT ONLY TAKE A MOMENT
TO REVEAL WHO WE REALLY ARE.

22:22.709 --> 22:24.750
- LOOKS LIKE YOU SPUN
A GODDAMN WEB.

22:24.750 --> 22:26.875
- IT'S MORE LIKE A PUZZLE.

22:26.875 --> 22:28.000
- SO CONNECT THE DOTS.

22:28.000 --> 22:29.834
CAN YOU PIN THIS
ON MUNRO OR NOT?

22:29.834 --> 22:31.458
- THE ENTRY WOUNDS
ON THE VICTIM

22:31.458 --> 22:34.417
ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE PUNCTURE
WOUNDS ON THE PREVIOUS VICTIMS.

22:34.417 --> 22:37.000
UH, SHE WAS STANDING
WHEN SHE WAS ATTACKED.

22:37.000 --> 22:40.333
SHE STUMBLED,
HER BODY TURNING.

22:40.333 --> 22:42.208
AND THE KILLER'S
BEHIND HER NOW,

22:42.208 --> 22:45.500
STABBING HER
IN THE BACK REPEATEDLY.

22:45.500 --> 22:48.166
AND THEN SHE'S
DOWN ON ALL FOURS,

22:48.166 --> 22:52.041
CRAWLING AWAY UNTIL THE KILLER
GRABS HER AND FLIPS HER OVER.

22:52.041 --> 22:53.625
HE'S ON TOP OF HER NOW.

22:53.625 --> 22:57.291
HE SLICES
HER CAROTID ARTERY.

22:57.291 --> 23:00.041
SHE'S TERRIFIED.
HEART'S RACING.

23:00.041 --> 23:01.792
IT'S RELEASING MORE BLOOD

23:01.792 --> 23:07.041
IN THICK ARTERIAL SPURTS
HERE AND HERE AND HERE.

23:07.041 --> 23:09.041
[chuckles]

23:09.041 --> 23:10.208
- I'VE NEVER SEEN SOMEONE
SO EXCITED

23:10.208 --> 23:12.208
ABOUT A CRIME SCENE BEFORE.

23:12.208 --> 23:14.041
YOU LIKE THIS BLOOD SHIT
A LITTLE TOO MUCH.

23:14.041 --> 23:15.542
- I'M JUST DOING MY JOB.

23:15.542 --> 23:18.083
- THEN WIPE THAT FUCKING SMILE
OFF YOUR FACE

23:18.083 --> 23:22.542
AND HELP ME
FIND THE CREEP WHO DID THIS.

23:22.542 --> 23:24.875
I LET MY GUARD DOWN.

23:24.875 --> 23:27.709
FOR AN INSTANT, MY REAL LIFE
BLED INTO MY FAKE LIFE,

23:27.709 --> 23:31.959
AND DOAKES CAUGHT HIS
FIRST GLIMPSE OF THE REAL ME.

23:31.959 --> 23:35.041
- [speaks Spanish]

23:45.000 --> 23:48.083
[engine starts]

24:00.291 --> 24:02.792
- THANKS FOR COMING, TOM.

24:02.792 --> 24:04.166
- CHRIST SAKES, MARIA.

24:04.166 --> 24:05.667
IT'S ALL OVER THE STATION.

24:05.667 --> 24:06.750
YOU TRIED TO FRAME DEXTER.

24:06.750 --> 24:08.917
- YOU KNOW
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

24:08.917 --> 24:12.250
- DO I?

24:12.250 --> 24:14.500
- THE COMMISSIONER'S GOING
TO OPEN AN INVESTIGATION

24:14.500 --> 24:16.542
INTO YOUR RECENT CONDUCT.

24:16.542 --> 24:19.417
IF CALLED TO TESTIFY
I'LL BE DRAGGED INTO THIS MESS

24:19.417 --> 24:21.500
AND HAVE NO CHOICE
BUT TO TELL THE TRUTH--

24:21.500 --> 24:23.542
THAT WE FOUND DEFINITIVE PROOF
IN THAT BOATHOUSE

24:23.542 --> 24:25.458
THAT DOAKES WAS
THE BAY HARBOR BUTCHER,

24:25.458 --> 24:28.417
AND THAT DESPITE ME ADVISING
YOU TO CEASE AND DESIST,

24:28.417 --> 24:31.291
YOU CONTINUED
ON THIS RECKLESS COURSE.

24:31.291 --> 24:33.458
- SO WHAT'S YOUR ADVICE?

24:33.458 --> 24:35.125
- GET ON YOUR KNEES
AND START KISSING ANYTHING

24:35.125 --> 24:37.125
THAT EVEN REMOTELY
RESEMBLES AN ASS.

24:37.125 --> 24:39.542
- I'M SERIOUS, TOM.

24:39.542 --> 24:42.041
I WAS HOPING
FOR YOUR SUPPORT.

24:42.041 --> 24:44.583
- AND MAKE MYSELF
LOOK AS CRAZY AS YOU?

24:44.583 --> 24:48.500
- PEOPLE STILL
RESPECT YOU HERE.

24:50.917 --> 24:53.667
I NEED SOMEONE
TO HAVE MY BACK, TOM.

24:53.667 --> 24:56.667
AND YOU COULD SAY
I HAD REASONABLE SUSPICION.

24:56.667 --> 24:57.667
- YOU CARRIED IT TOO FAR.

24:57.667 --> 24:58.667
- WELL, THEN SAY THAT.

24:58.667 --> 25:01.125
SAY THAT DUE TO MY
OVERZEALOUS NATURE

25:01.125 --> 25:04.166
AS A POLICE OFFICER, I GOT
TOO CAUGHT UP IN THE CASE.

25:04.166 --> 25:06.166
- YOU GOT TOO CAUGHT UP
BEING AN IDIOT.

25:06.166 --> 25:09.041
- I'M ALREADY DOWN, TOM.

25:09.041 --> 25:11.875
STOP KICKING.

25:16.125 --> 25:20.625
MY JOB IS AT STAKE.

25:20.625 --> 25:25.250
TOM.

25:25.250 --> 25:28.166
- ALL RIGHT.

25:28.166 --> 25:29.166
I'LL SEE WHAT I CAN DO.

25:29.166 --> 25:32.000
- THANK YOU.

25:32.000 --> 25:36.625
- YOU JUST KEEP
YOUR HEAD LOW.

25:36.625 --> 25:38.583
AND FOR GOD'S SAKE,
START DOING YOUR JOB

25:38.583 --> 25:41.500
IF YOU HAVE ANY HOPE
OF KEEPING IT.

25:53.542 --> 25:57.208
- LIEUTENANT.
WHAT BRINGS YOU HERE?

25:57.208 --> 26:00.291
- I'M THE ARRESTING OFFICER.

26:00.291 --> 26:02.333
- HOW'S THE WRIST?

26:02.333 --> 26:04.542
- STRONGER EVERY DAY.

26:04.542 --> 26:07.083
HOW'S FACING LIFE WITHOUT
THE POSSIBILITY OF PAROLE?

26:07.083 --> 26:11.458
- LAST TIME I CHECKED IT'S
INNOCENT UNTIL PROVEN GUILTY.

26:11.458 --> 26:12.750
- WELL, THIS IS
YOUR LAST CHANCE.

26:12.750 --> 26:14.333
YOU CAN SAVE YOURSELF
A LOT OF TIME AND TROUBLE

26:14.333 --> 26:17.041
AND CONFESS
WHAT YOU'VE DONE.

26:17.041 --> 26:18.208
- I WILL IF YOU WILL.

26:18.208 --> 26:20.333
- [laughs]
MY CONSCIENCE IS CLEAR.

26:20.333 --> 26:24.458
- [laughs]
ALL THAT XANAX.

26:24.458 --> 26:27.208
MY, HOW YOU MUST HAVE TROUBLE
SLEEPING AT NIGHT.

26:27.208 --> 26:30.250
- YOU DON'T KNOW
SHIT ABOUT ME.

26:30.250 --> 26:32.250
CAN WE HAVE A MINUTE?

26:32.250 --> 26:33.542
- EXCEPT THAT YOU'RE
THE LIEUTENANT OF HOMICIDE

26:33.542 --> 26:35.250
AND YOU WEAR
A BIG SHINY BADGE,

26:35.250 --> 26:40.750
AND YET YOU KNOW EXACTLY
WHAT YOUR BROTHER IS.

26:40.750 --> 26:43.166
DON'T WORRY.
I'M NOT GONNA TELL ANYONE.

26:43.166 --> 26:45.875
THEY WOULDN'T BELIEVE ME
EVEN IF I DID.

26:45.875 --> 26:48.417
BUT KNOWING THAT YOU
HAVE TO LIVE WITH IT

26:48.417 --> 26:51.417
IS, UM, PUNISHMENT ENOUGH.

26:51.417 --> 26:53.750
STILL, I'M CURIOUS.

26:53.750 --> 26:58.917
HOW DO YOU JUSTIFY
ARRESTING ME AND NOT HIM?

26:58.917 --> 27:00.542
OR IS THE LAW
JUST SOMETHING

27:00.542 --> 27:03.583
THAT YOU MAKE UP
AS YOU GO ALONG?

27:03.583 --> 27:06.333
TURNING A BLIND EYE
WHENEVER YOU FEEL LIKE IT,

27:06.333 --> 27:08.250
OR WHENEVER
DEXTER IS INVOLVED.

27:08.250 --> 27:10.625
- FUCK...YOU.

27:10.625 --> 27:14.750
YOU ARE A LIAR AND A KILLER.

27:14.750 --> 27:16.458
- BUT NOT A HYPOCRITE.

27:16.458 --> 27:17.917
- MS. MCKAY, COME ON.

27:17.917 --> 27:20.750
LET'S GO.

27:23.083 --> 27:25.875
- HANNAH MCKAY, YOU ARE CHARGED
WITH MURDER IN THE FIRST DEGREE

27:25.875 --> 27:28.041
IN CONNECTION WITH THE DEATH
OF SALVADOR PRICE.

27:28.041 --> 27:29.041
HOW DO YOU PLEAD?

27:29.041 --> 27:31.166
- MY CLIENT PLEADS
NOT GUILTY, YOUR HONOR.

27:31.166 --> 27:32.625
- MS. MCKAY,
YOU ARE HEREBY REMANDED

27:32.625 --> 27:35.542
TO THE STATE OF FLORIDA,
AND BAIL IS DENIED.

27:35.542 --> 27:38.041
- NO!

27:38.041 --> 27:39.917
HANNAH.

27:39.917 --> 27:40.917
I'M SO SORRY.

27:40.917 --> 27:41.959
- LISTEN TO ME.

27:41.959 --> 27:43.792
IT'S GONNA BE FINE, OKAY?

27:43.792 --> 27:45.959
- MA'AM, YOU NEED
TO STEP BACK, PLEASE.

27:45.959 --> 27:48.875
- THANK YOU.
GOOD-BYE.

27:48.875 --> 27:51.291
- [sobbing]

27:51.291 --> 27:54.458
[knocks on door]

27:54.458 --> 27:58.250
- MARIA, JUST CHECKING IN.

27:58.250 --> 28:00.709
- THAT'S NICE OF YOU.

28:00.709 --> 28:04.375
SEEMS EVERYONE ELSE
IS AVOIDING ME.

28:04.375 --> 28:05.834
- YOU KNOW HOW IT IS.

28:05.834 --> 28:07.667
EVERYONE IS WAITING
TO SEE WHERE THIS LANDS.

28:07.667 --> 28:09.542
- I'M DOING EVERYTHING I CAN
TO MAKE SURE

28:09.542 --> 28:11.625
IT DOESN'T LAND
ON MY HEAD.

28:11.625 --> 28:14.208
- YOU NEED TO SHOW UP
TO MY PARTY.

28:14.208 --> 28:17.667
- I REALLY DON'T THINK ANYONE
WANTS TO SEE ME THERE.

28:17.667 --> 28:21.000
- OF COURSE THEY DO.

28:21.000 --> 28:23.792
IT'S ALSO AN OPPORTUNITY
FOR YOU TO APOLOGIZE TO DEXTER.

28:23.792 --> 28:25.542
- A PUBLIC ACT
OF CONTRITION.

28:25.542 --> 28:27.667
- IF YOU STRAIGHTEN IT OUT
WITH HIM,

28:27.667 --> 28:29.333
HE CAN TELL
THE PEOPLE UPSTAIRS

28:29.333 --> 28:32.083
THAT IT WAS JUST
A MISUNDERSTANDING.

28:32.083 --> 28:34.166
EITHER WAY,
SHOW UP TONIGHT.

28:34.166 --> 28:35.709
IT'S NOT JUST NEW YEAR'S EVE.

28:35.709 --> 28:37.792
IT'S ALSO
MY RETIREMENT PARTY.

28:37.792 --> 28:38.959
- OH.

28:38.959 --> 28:41.709
- IT WOULDN'T FEEL RIGHT
WITHOUT YOU.

28:41.709 --> 28:44.834
- I'LL BE THERE.

28:58.083 --> 29:01.542
- 1,500 CCs, SUPERCHARGED...

29:01.542 --> 29:06.208
[grunting and gasping]

29:06.208 --> 29:08.417
[gagging]

29:08.417 --> 29:13.208
- SHIT!
WHAT THE FUCK?

29:13.208 --> 29:15.041
- SEWARD MEMORIAL
HOSPITAL, NOW!

29:15.041 --> 29:17.959
SHE'S HAVING
SOME SORT OF SEIZURE.

29:21.917 --> 29:24.000
- SHE SEEMS STABLE.

29:24.000 --> 29:27.792
WE'RE BRINGING HER INTO SEWARD
MEMORIAL EMERGENCY RIGHT NOW.

29:30.917 --> 29:35.041
- WE'D BETTER CONTACT
HER NEXT OF KIN.

29:35.041 --> 29:37.208
- HANG ON, SWEETHEART.

29:37.208 --> 29:41.250
GO AHEAD AND GET HER AN MRI,
MAKE SURE IT'S WITH CONTRAST.

30:17.291 --> 30:20.083
- LET'S HOPE
MY HUNCH IS RIGHT.

30:20.083 --> 30:22.166
THAT THE PULL
OF A LONG-PAST ROMANCE

30:22.166 --> 30:25.625
IS ENOUGH TO COMPEL
FLORENCIA TO HELP ESTRADA.

30:25.625 --> 30:29.625
- YOU WANTED TO TALK.

30:29.625 --> 30:33.291
- DEB, COME IN
AND HAVE A SEAT.

30:33.291 --> 30:36.458
- WHAT'S UP?

30:36.458 --> 30:38.333
- YOU WERE RIGHT.

30:38.333 --> 30:41.917
- ABOUT?
- ME.

30:41.917 --> 30:46.041
I LET MY FEELINGS
FOR SERGEANT DOAKES

30:46.041 --> 30:48.166
AFFECT MY DECISION-MAKING.

30:48.166 --> 30:50.458
WHAT I PUT
YOUR BROTHER THROUGH

30:50.458 --> 30:56.083
WAS NEGLIGENT
AND UNFORGIVABLE.

30:56.083 --> 31:00.500
AND I'M SORRY.

31:00.500 --> 31:04.500
IF IT'S ANY CONSOLATION,
MY CAREER IS GONNA TAKE A HIT.

31:04.500 --> 31:08.125
SUSPENSION,
PROBABLY WORSE.

31:08.125 --> 31:09.834
- I HOPE NOT.

31:09.834 --> 31:13.083
- YOU DON'T HAVE TO SAY THAT.

31:13.083 --> 31:17.208
EITHER WAY, IN THE EVENT
I'M NOT AROUND MUCH LONGER,

31:17.208 --> 31:21.750
I WANNA LEAVE THINGS
IN SOME KIND OF ORDER.

31:21.750 --> 31:25.375
I WAS TRYING SO HARD TO PROVE
THAT THE BAY HARBOR BUTCHER

31:25.375 --> 31:28.333
WAS STILL ACTIVE,
I OVERLOOKED SOME LOOSE ENDS

31:28.333 --> 31:30.083
ON TRAVIS MARSHALL'S DEATH.

31:30.083 --> 31:32.834
I WAS HOPING YOU COULD
HELP ME WITH THE TIMELINE.

31:32.834 --> 31:34.917
- SURE.

31:34.917 --> 31:39.125
- OKAY, ACCORDING
TO DEXTER'S STATEMENT,

31:39.125 --> 31:42.500
PREVIOUS TO THE DAY WE FOUND
TRAVIS MARSHALL'S BODY

31:42.500 --> 31:45.583
HE WAS DOING HIS FINAL FORENSICS
SWEEP ON THE CHURCH.

31:45.583 --> 31:48.417
- YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.
- UNDER YOUR SUPERVISION.

31:48.417 --> 31:51.041
- NO...I MEAN,
YES, I SENT HIM,

31:51.041 --> 31:52.417
BUT HE WAS ON HIS OWN.

31:52.417 --> 31:54.291
HE DOESN'T NEED
SOMEONE TO WATCH HIM.

31:54.291 --> 31:57.709
- YOU DIDN'T GO TO THE CHURCH
THAT DAY OR EVENING?

31:57.709 --> 31:59.834
- NO.

31:59.834 --> 32:01.291
- YOU SURE?

32:01.291 --> 32:04.417
- YES.

32:12.417 --> 32:13.709
- WHEN I WAS GOING THROUGH
THE MAIL THIS MORNING,

32:13.709 --> 32:15.834
I GOT A PACKAGE
FROM MIKE ANDERSON'S WIDOW.

32:15.834 --> 32:19.583
AND IT SEEMS THAT
BEFORE MIKE DIED,

32:19.583 --> 32:21.834
HE ORDERED SECURITY FOOTAGE

32:21.834 --> 32:23.709
FROM ALL GAS STATIONS
AROUND THE CHURCH.

32:23.709 --> 32:29.083
AND...SOMEHOW THIS GOT LUMPED
INTO HIS PERSONAL BELONGINGS.

32:29.083 --> 32:34.583
IT RECENTLY
GOT SENT TO ME, SO...

32:34.583 --> 32:37.959
CAN YOU SEE THAT?

32:37.959 --> 32:40.458
THAT'S TWO BLOCKS
FROM THE CHURCH.

32:40.458 --> 32:42.959
AND THERE'S A TIMESTAMP.

32:42.959 --> 32:47.125
IT WAS 22 MINUTES BEFORE
THE FIRE DEPARTMENT GOT THE CALL

32:47.125 --> 32:52.000
ON THE BURNING CHURCH.

32:52.000 --> 32:54.959
WHAT WERE YOU DOING THERE,
LIEUTENANT?

32:57.000 --> 33:00.333
- WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE.
I WAS GETTING GAS.

33:00.333 --> 33:02.125
- THEN WHY LIE ABOUT IT?

33:02.125 --> 33:05.625
- I DIDN'T LIE.
I FORGOT.

33:05.625 --> 33:07.917
IT WAS A CRAZY NIGHT.

33:07.917 --> 33:11.000
- YOU WERE CERTAIN
ABOUT IT A MOMENT AGO.

33:11.000 --> 33:15.667
- NO--I'M--I'M SORRY.
I--

33:15.667 --> 33:17.959
I TOOK SOME FOOD TO DEXTER
AT THE CHURCH,

33:17.959 --> 33:20.000
BUT I WAS ONLY THERE FOR,
LIKE, 30 SECONDS.

33:20.000 --> 33:23.166
SO I DIDN'T THINK
THAT IT WAS WORTH REMEMBERING.

33:23.166 --> 33:26.792
- AND THEN YOU GOT SOME GAS.
- YES.

33:26.792 --> 33:29.917
- THAT YOU PUT IN A GAS CAN?

33:29.917 --> 33:33.166
- YEAH.

33:33.166 --> 33:35.000
- WHY IN THE WORLD--

33:35.000 --> 33:36.834
- CAPTAIN,
WHERE IS THIS GOING?

33:36.834 --> 33:40.792
- THAT'S UP TO YOU,
LIEUTENANT.

33:42.417 --> 33:45.000
DEBRA...

33:45.000 --> 33:48.583
WE'VE KNOWN EACH OTHER
A LONG TIME.

33:48.583 --> 33:53.625
IS THERE SOMETHING
YOU WANNA GET OFF YOUR CHEST?

34:01.125 --> 34:04.041
- YES.

34:15.625 --> 34:19.583
I THINK YOU'VE BEEN UNDER
A LOT OF STRESS.

34:24.250 --> 34:27.166
- YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK?

34:30.208 --> 34:34.709
I THINK I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE
WHO MADE A MISTAKE

34:34.709 --> 34:38.667
TRYING TO PROTECT
SOMEONE THEY CARE ABOUT.

34:43.375 --> 34:46.083
- IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE,
CAPTAIN?

34:46.083 --> 34:48.417
- NOT FOR NOW.

34:48.417 --> 34:52.208
BUT THIS IS JUST THE START
OF A MUCH LARGER CONVERSATION.

34:54.458 --> 34:57.542
COUNT ON IT.

35:25.417 --> 35:27.542
- ESTRADA.

35:29.834 --> 35:33.208
I GUESS SOME BONDS
ARE UNBREAKABLE.

35:33.208 --> 35:37.166
WE NEVER LEAVE BEHIND
THE ONES WE LOVE.

35:47.041 --> 35:50.166
HE COULD BE THERE ALL DAY.

35:54.208 --> 35:58.125
AND YOU CAN KEEP THAT,
ALL RIGHT?

36:02.125 --> 36:05.333
- HEY!
- [kids laugh]

36:09.542 --> 36:12.458
- [speaks Spanish angrily]

36:16.792 --> 36:19.875
[phone rings]

36:19.875 --> 36:22.875
- HI, DEB.

36:22.875 --> 36:26.125
W--NOW?

36:26.125 --> 36:27.792
OKAY.

36:27.792 --> 36:30.500
GIVE ME 15 MINUTES.

36:30.500 --> 36:32.166
- SHE'S STILL UNCONSCIOUS,
BUT THE SEIZURES HAVE STOPPED

36:32.166 --> 36:33.667
AND WE'VE GOT HER STABILIZED.

36:33.667 --> 36:35.166
WE'RE WAITING FOR A DOCTOR.

36:35.166 --> 36:36.875
- WE COULD USE
YOUR HELP OVER HERE.

36:36.875 --> 36:39.458
[overlapping chatter]

36:48.041 --> 36:50.083
- [sighs]
OKAY.

36:50.083 --> 36:53.125
- LAGUERTA KNEW
I WAS LYING, DEX.

36:53.125 --> 36:57.500
- WAIT, WAIT,
LET ME THINK.

36:57.500 --> 36:59.542
- WHAT?

36:59.542 --> 37:01.250
- THIS IS BAD, DEB.

37:01.250 --> 37:03.792
- I DON'T WANNA
FUCKING HEAR YOU SAY THAT.

37:03.792 --> 37:06.000
YOU ALWAYS SAY
THAT YOU CAN FIX IT.

37:06.000 --> 37:07.959
- I WILL.

37:07.959 --> 37:12.000
JUST DON'T KNOW HOW YET.

37:12.000 --> 37:15.000
LOOK, IT WAS DANGEROUS ENOUGH
WHEN SHE WAS FOCUSED JUST ON ME,

37:15.000 --> 37:16.375
BUT NOW THAT
SHE'S PULLED YOU INTO THIS,

37:16.375 --> 37:18.542
WELL, IT'S WORSE.

37:18.542 --> 37:20.417
- TELL ME ABOUT IT.

37:20.417 --> 37:22.125
- [sighs]

37:22.125 --> 37:24.125
I KNOW I'VE SAID THIS
A HUNDRED TIMES--

37:24.125 --> 37:26.375
- BUT YOU'RE SORRY
THAT I GOT INVOLVED IN THIS.

37:26.375 --> 37:29.709
- I AM.

37:29.709 --> 37:32.667
- ARE WE REALLY THAT FUCKED?

37:34.750 --> 37:37.750
- LOOK, ALL SHE KNOWS
IS THAT YOU BOUGHT SOME GAS.

37:37.750 --> 37:39.333
THAT'S NOT A CRIME.

37:39.333 --> 37:42.125
- YEAH, BUT BUYING GAS
TO BURN DOWN A CHURCH

37:42.125 --> 37:44.750
TO COVER UP THE FACT THAT YOU
KILLED TRAVIS MARSHALL IS.

37:44.750 --> 37:45.959
AND SHE KNOWS THAT.

37:45.959 --> 37:48.333
- BUT SHE CAN'T PROVE IT.

37:48.333 --> 37:50.542
YET.

37:50.542 --> 37:52.583
I NEED TO KNOW
WHAT ELSE SHE HAS,

37:52.583 --> 37:53.834
WHAT HER NEXT MOVE IS.

37:53.834 --> 37:57.458
IF ALL SHE'S GOT IS THAT DVD,
I CAN HANDLE THIS.

37:57.458 --> 37:59.917
- IS THIS EVER GONNA END?

37:59.917 --> 38:02.875
- YEAH, IT WILL.

38:05.917 --> 38:07.959
JUST GO BACK TO WORK.

38:07.959 --> 38:11.083
TRY AND ACT NORMAL.

38:11.083 --> 38:14.041
- NORMAL?
WHAT THE FUCK IS NORMAL?

38:14.041 --> 38:15.041
- JUST DO THE BEST YOU CAN.

38:15.041 --> 38:16.375
I'LL DEAL WITH LAGUERTA.

38:16.375 --> 38:18.083
[thuds and groans]

38:18.083 --> 38:19.166
- WHAT THE HELL IS THAT?

38:19.166 --> 38:22.250
- ESTRADA.

38:35.875 --> 38:38.250
- OH, SHIT.
LET'S GO!

38:38.250 --> 38:39.583
THIS IS OFFICER ARMES
CALLING FOR BACKUP.

38:39.583 --> 38:43.250
WE NEED UNITS
AT SEWARD MEMORIAL.

38:58.291 --> 38:59.834
- LAGUERTA'S HOUSE.

38:59.834 --> 39:03.375
WHAT IS IT YOU'RE HOPING
TO FIND, DEXTER?

39:03.375 --> 39:06.458
- I DON'T KNOW.

39:14.041 --> 39:15.500
NOT THIS.

39:15.500 --> 39:17.542
- WARRANTS.

39:17.542 --> 39:19.333
- WITH A JUDGE'S SIGNATURE...

39:19.333 --> 39:24.750
ALLOWING LAGUERTA TO TRACK
THE GPS ON MY PHONE AND DEBRA'S

39:24.750 --> 39:27.333
THE NIGHT
THE CHURCH BURNED DOWN.

39:27.333 --> 39:29.333
ONCE THIS WARRANT
GOES THROUGH,
