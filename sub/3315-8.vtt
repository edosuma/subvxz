00:25.984 --> 00:27.653
(labored breathing)

00:31.907 --> 00:33.492
No.

00:33.575 --> 00:35.202
No.

00:38.580 --> 00:41.458
This is wrong. It's all wrong.

00:47.798 --> 00:49.341
Who are you?

00:49.967 --> 00:52.135
What did you do to my house,
my belongings?

00:52.219 --> 00:54.054
I'm terribly confused.

00:55.138 --> 00:57.474
These things aren't mine.

00:57.558 --> 00:59.434
These furnishings,

00:59.518 --> 01:02.729
the fabrics, they're cheap.

01:03.272 --> 01:05.107
Vulgar.

01:05.190 --> 01:07.568
They've picked the flesh
off my beautiful home

01:07.651 --> 01:11.405
and left the skeleton, the bare bones.

01:15.200 --> 01:17.119
MAN: How can I comfort you?

01:19.746 --> 01:21.415
My baby.

01:23.083 --> 01:24.543
(whispering) Where's my baby?

01:25.460 --> 01:27.588
Is that what you want, a baby?

01:28.630 --> 01:30.048
Yes.

01:31.466 --> 01:33.218
I just want my baby.

01:39.224 --> 01:41.143
(crickets chirping)

01:49.109 --> 01:51.904
(door creaks, thumps)

01:51.987 --> 01:53.530
(gasps)

01:53.614 --> 01:55.741
(scoffs)

01:55.824 --> 01:58.285
I thought I told you
to throw that thing away.

01:59.620 --> 02:01.872
Oh, you're not talking?

02:02.915 --> 02:04.875
You really want to go for round two, huh?

02:07.044 --> 02:09.129
(Vivien moaning)

02:22.351 --> 02:23.685
I love you.

02:24.770 --> 02:26.188
I love you too.

02:46.041 --> 02:48.043
<i>(♪♪♪)</i>

03:49.771 --> 03:51.899
VIVIEN: I'm not crazy. She was here.

03:51.982 --> 03:53.692
She was here looking at everything,

03:53.775 --> 03:57.487
going on about butterfly wings and...
And the Tiffany glass,

03:57.571 --> 03:58.822
as if she built the house herself.

03:58.906 --> 04:00.616
MARCY: She must've had a granddaughter.

04:00.699 --> 04:03.118
Marcy, you were on the same murder tour
I was on.

04:03.202 --> 04:08.248
He said she killed herself,
and her only child was dead.

04:08.332 --> 04:11.126
They do say we all have
a doppelganger, Mrs. Harmon.

04:11.210 --> 04:14.713
It feels as if someone is trying
to make me feel like I'm crazy.

04:14.796 --> 04:16.131
Oh, Lord.

04:16.215 --> 04:19.092
Moira, how about a calming cup
of tea for Mrs. Harmon?

04:19.176 --> 04:20.761
VIVIEN: Don't patronize me, Marcy.

04:20.844 --> 04:24.348
In fact, there is someone who wants
my husband, who wants my life.

04:24.431 --> 04:26.058
You know, Cousin Helen went paranoid

04:26.141 --> 04:28.310
when she was pregnant with her second.

04:28.393 --> 04:31.146
She imagined the stuffed animals
in the nursery,

04:31.230 --> 04:33.857
dancing to some dreadful African drumbeat.

04:33.941 --> 04:36.527
She thought they were
enacting voodoo on her.

04:36.610 --> 04:38.195
We got her hormones straightened out,

04:38.278 --> 04:40.656
and she was right back
on the happy track in no time.

04:40.739 --> 04:42.407
There are things in this world

04:42.491 --> 04:44.451
that can't be explained
by the rational mind.

04:44.535 --> 04:47.287
I'd love to spend the day
debating the supernatural,

04:47.371 --> 04:50.165
but I've got to pop by
Mr. Escandarian's office.

04:50.249 --> 04:53.126
He's not answering my calls,
and if we don't open escrow,

04:53.210 --> 04:54.586
you're gonna have a bigger problem

04:54.670 --> 04:55.754
than your little ghost story.

04:56.338 --> 04:57.714
Mmm.

04:58.423 --> 05:00.384
Or do we think he's a ghost too?

05:00.467 --> 05:01.718
Marcy.

05:04.388 --> 05:06.640
I, for one, believe in things unseen.

05:06.723 --> 05:08.684
Who knows, Mrs. Harmon?

05:09.476 --> 05:11.311
We're all just lost souls, aren't we?

05:11.395 --> 05:13.021
(sighs)

05:13.105 --> 05:14.565
Maybe I am going crazy.

05:14.648 --> 05:17.317
I feel like I'm going crazy.

05:17.401 --> 05:19.695
I feel like I'm gonna break
into a million pieces.

05:19.778 --> 05:21.488
He's cheating. I can tell.

05:21.572 --> 05:23.365
-How?
-(sighs)

05:23.448 --> 05:25.200
He's weird. He's gotten weird.

05:25.284 --> 05:27.578
-Weird how?
-Weird.

05:27.661 --> 05:30.664
About money, about the renovations.

05:30.747 --> 05:32.499
Weird about having a baby.

05:32.583 --> 05:34.501
I'm not sure he even wants one anymore.

05:34.585 --> 05:36.920
Every time I bring up a
color scheme for the nursery,

05:37.004 --> 05:38.130
he changes the subject.

05:38.213 --> 05:41.300
I don't know why you insist
on torturing him with your swatches.

05:41.383 --> 05:42.801
The point is

05:42.885 --> 05:44.845
I go out of my way
to make him feel included,

05:44.928 --> 05:46.346
but he's distant, distracted.

05:46.430 --> 05:49.099
-He's even been sleepwalking.
-Okay, Chad.

05:49.183 --> 05:52.936
None of this is exactly
evidence of infidelity.

05:53.020 --> 05:54.813
No.

05:54.897 --> 05:57.149
But what I found on his computer is.

05:57.858 --> 06:00.694
<i>He usually logs off.</i><i>This time he didn't.</i>

06:00.777 --> 06:04.489
<i>He's been carrying on</i>
<i>a truly vile online relationship...</i>

06:04.573 --> 06:08.827
<i>with some S &amp; M freak</i>
<i>who calls himself JungleJim4322.</i>

06:09.912 --> 06:13.999
<i>I can't even believe he types those words,</i>
<i>let alone does those things.</i>

06:14.082 --> 06:15.709
It's completely humiliating.

06:15.792 --> 06:18.420
Look. Pat's obviously got some interests

06:18.504 --> 06:21.006
that he doesn't feel free
sharing with you.

06:21.089 --> 06:22.090
Ugh.

06:22.174 --> 06:24.218
Now, if you don't want
to end up sharing him,

06:24.301 --> 06:26.553
then you need to make a preemptive strike.

06:26.637 --> 06:27.763
What do you mean?

06:27.846 --> 06:29.014
I mean you have to fight.

06:29.097 --> 06:32.643
Pat's a great guy, Chad,
worth fighting for.

06:32.726 --> 06:34.436
And if that means that you have to fight

06:34.520 --> 06:36.939
with a cat-o'-nine-tails
and some titty clamps,

06:37.022 --> 06:39.733
well, then, brother, you better gear up.

06:39.816 --> 06:41.318
MAN (on speakers): <i>♪ I love sex ♪</i>

06:41.401 --> 06:45.447
Mike's Spikes makes this
stainless steel ball stretcher.

06:45.531 --> 06:48.158
Spikes are fully adjustable.

06:48.242 --> 06:52.204
The Ultimate Asslock,
also known as the Apple of Anguish.

06:52.287 --> 06:54.873
Is, uh, any of this working for you?

06:54.957 --> 06:57.584
I don't... I don't like pain, so...

06:57.668 --> 06:59.211
Okay.

06:59.294 --> 07:01.839
Maybe we start with
a simple pair of handcuffs.

07:03.423 --> 07:06.093
Uh, look, I'm sorry. Um...

07:06.176 --> 07:09.096
My boyfriend has been in these chat rooms.

07:09.179 --> 07:11.431
That's always how it starts.

07:11.515 --> 07:13.016
Is he dominant or submissive?

07:14.309 --> 07:16.019
I don't know.

07:16.103 --> 07:19.106
I'm usually the one who calls the shots.

07:19.189 --> 07:22.025
Then maybe he wants
to be the dom for a change.

07:22.109 --> 07:23.402
Huh.

07:23.485 --> 07:25.362
Well, that's interesting.
I never thought of that.

07:25.445 --> 07:27.698
Every relationship's a power play,

07:27.781 --> 07:29.908
with or without the props.

07:30.409 --> 07:32.369
What about a muzzle?

07:32.452 --> 07:34.413
He's forever telling me I talk too much.

07:34.496 --> 07:36.456
Yeah, the muzzle's good.

07:37.457 --> 07:38.792
But if you're feeling brave,

07:38.876 --> 07:40.627
I got just the thing.

07:47.009 --> 07:49.178
The hood's fully detachable,

07:49.261 --> 07:52.139
and the harness
has anchor points for bondage.

07:52.222 --> 07:55.726
Forgive me. Um, I don't get any of this.

07:55.809 --> 07:56.935
At all.

07:57.019 --> 07:59.313
The point of the suit is
to dehumanize the submissive,

08:00.022 --> 08:02.441
turn him into a rubber sex toy.

08:02.524 --> 08:04.401
Why don't you try it on?

08:04.484 --> 08:06.403
Oh, no, no.

08:06.486 --> 08:08.322
I don't think I have the body for that.

08:08.405 --> 08:10.949
You wouldn't believe how slimming it is,
especially in black.

08:12.284 --> 08:14.203
Get the suit. If it doesn't work out,

08:14.286 --> 08:16.622
you can always wear it for Halloween.

08:17.581 --> 08:19.041
I do love Halloween.

08:19.124 --> 08:20.959
And it is right around the corner.

08:31.678 --> 08:33.514
(nail clipper clicking)

08:38.018 --> 08:40.979
(laughing) What are you...

08:44.691 --> 08:47.569
Decide to go as a sausage
for Halloween this year?

08:56.119 --> 08:58.121
Dude, I'm in the middle of this.

09:00.082 --> 09:01.542
(suit squeaks)

09:02.125 --> 09:05.838
I am serious.
I hate how that feels against my skin.

09:05.921 --> 09:07.381
Take it off, so we can watch Rachel Zoe

09:07.464 --> 09:09.341
without me worrying about you passing out.

09:12.803 --> 09:15.430
Why are you being such an asshole?

09:15.514 --> 09:18.016
This turns you on. I know it does.

09:18.100 --> 09:19.601
Seriously, Chad,

09:19.685 --> 09:22.521
depressing sex is even more
depressing when you try so hard.

09:25.107 --> 09:27.609
Who is JungleJim4322@yahoo.com?

09:29.403 --> 09:32.155
-I don't know.
-Stop lying. The lying is worse.

09:32.239 --> 09:34.616
-First my phone, now my e-mail?
-Have you ever met up with him?

09:34.700 --> 09:36.994
Because if he brought disease
into this house, I swear to God...

09:37.077 --> 09:38.996
No, never.

09:39.079 --> 09:41.039
And jerking off with a guy online
isn't cheating.

09:41.999 --> 09:43.584
I want you to get out. Go.

09:43.667 --> 09:46.086
Stay at some Motel 6.
It's all you can afford.

09:46.170 --> 09:48.922
You know what? I changed my mind.
Leave the suit on.

09:49.006 --> 09:51.383
It's appropriate, considering how much
of a little bitch you are.

09:51.925 --> 09:53.969
I wanted to have a baby with you.

09:54.052 --> 09:55.762
Why are you doing this to me?

09:55.846 --> 09:58.056
The house, decorating, I hate it!

09:58.140 --> 10:01.059
It's no wonder I don't want to stick
my dick in you anymore.

10:01.143 --> 10:03.604
(chuckling) You know what?

10:03.687 --> 10:05.731
Go find JungleJim.

10:06.356 --> 10:08.775
See if he'll redo every
bathroom in this house

10:08.859 --> 10:11.737
to your exact,
nouveau riche specifications.

10:11.820 --> 10:13.864
What are you gonna do when we lose it?

10:13.947 --> 10:15.657
What are you gonna hold over my head

10:15.741 --> 10:18.118
when the bank comes
and takes this place away from us?

10:21.413 --> 10:23.457
You don't think I read our bills?

10:23.540 --> 10:25.209
Our statements?

10:30.964 --> 10:33.008
-Where are you going?
-Out.

10:33.091 --> 10:36.261
And for the record,
I like leather, not latex.

10:46.188 --> 10:47.898
(sobbing)

10:52.778 --> 10:55.572
(sobbing)

10:58.242 --> 11:01.328
Good God, woman,
you've got to knock this shit off.

11:01.411 --> 11:03.413
I... I beg your pardon?

11:03.497 --> 11:04.665
The crying.

11:04.748 --> 11:07.334
You gotta get it under control.
You're making me nuts.

11:08.168 --> 11:10.212
I'm very confused.
What are you doing in my house?

11:10.295 --> 11:12.506
I am stuck here like the others.

11:12.589 --> 11:13.924
Like you.

11:14.007 --> 11:16.927
We died in here, and for whatever reason,
we can't leave.

11:17.010 --> 11:18.887
What are you implying? That...

11:19.930 --> 11:21.348
That you're dead?

11:21.431 --> 11:23.475
I'm not implying it. I'm saying it.

11:23.559 --> 11:25.936
Yeah, dead. Dead as disco.

11:28.063 --> 11:29.690
I don't understand.

11:29.773 --> 11:30.858
Oh.

11:31.859 --> 11:33.944
Of course you don't, honey.

11:34.027 --> 11:35.237
But you're not the only one.

11:36.154 --> 11:38.323
There are other souls trapped in here,

11:39.324 --> 11:41.952
<i>innocent,</i><i>beautiful souls,</i>

11:42.035 --> 11:44.788
<i>who never knew malice</i><i>or anger.</i>

11:45.831 --> 11:48.792
<i>It's not fair that they're trapped</i>
<i>in a place like this.</i>

11:48.876 --> 11:51.044
It's heartbreaking.

11:51.128 --> 11:53.130
Then there are others
who are just in on the game.

11:53.672 --> 11:54.965
They're bitches.

11:55.090 --> 11:57.843
I don't like you. I don't like your type.

11:58.468 --> 12:02.514
You're cheap and horrible
and not half the lady madam is.

12:02.598 --> 12:05.184
Why you insist on hurting her
is only a reflection

12:05.267 --> 12:06.852
of your low character
and lack of breeding.

12:06.935 --> 12:10.230
Oh, don't act all high and mighty with me,
you old bat.

12:10.314 --> 12:12.107
I saw you feed her raw brains.

12:12.191 --> 12:13.817
That was for her benefit,

12:13.901 --> 12:15.819
to ensure the health of her unborn babies.

12:18.822 --> 12:21.783
Whoops. Guess you'll have
to clean that up, huh?

12:21.867 --> 12:23.368
HAYDEN: <i>We linger here</i><i>with the living.</i>

12:23.452 --> 12:25.287
No rest for them,

12:25.370 --> 12:26.705
no rest for us.

12:28.832 --> 12:30.417
It's this place.

12:30.626 --> 12:32.252
It has a hold on us.

12:34.087 --> 12:35.464
But that's not all.

12:35.547 --> 12:38.091
There's a power in it.

12:38.175 --> 12:39.885
A power we can use.

12:39.968 --> 12:42.554
<i>We can make</i><i>ourselves unknown,</i>

12:51.396 --> 12:55.025
<i>and when we really need it,</i>
<i>we can make ourselves known.</i>

12:55.108 --> 12:56.360
<i>And I have such a need.</i>

12:56.568 --> 12:59.196
Sometimes I vibrate with such rage

12:59.279 --> 13:01.573
it terrifies me.

13:01.657 --> 13:02.950
I act out.

13:04.243 --> 13:06.328
You know, my wife, Constance,
has quite the temper.

13:06.411 --> 13:07.955
If she catches us, we...

13:08.038 --> 13:10.123
Yeah, but she never does.

13:11.834 --> 13:14.253
(screaming)

13:17.881 --> 13:19.633
(panting)

13:22.553 --> 13:23.554
(sighs)

13:23.637 --> 13:25.889
HAYDEN: <i>If we're supposed</i>
<i>to fix our issues,</i>

13:25.973 --> 13:27.015
<i>we never can.</i>

13:28.851 --> 13:31.395
-Hey. You want anything from the kitchen?
<i>-It doesn't stick.</i>

13:35.357 --> 13:36.358
(sighs)

13:36.441 --> 13:38.652
What you're saying is madness.

13:38.986 --> 13:40.404
I'm not dead.

13:40.487 --> 13:42.573
Then how do you explain this, sweetheart?

13:46.785 --> 13:49.121
What... (sniffles)

13:49.204 --> 13:51.206
What is that? Ugh.

13:51.290 --> 13:53.333
Looks to me like an exit wound.

13:53.500 --> 13:55.586
My guess is you ate a bullet.

13:55.669 --> 13:58.338
And by the looks of those clothes,
it was a long time ago.

13:58.422 --> 14:00.090
Why would I do such a thing?

14:04.303 --> 14:06.013
Was it because of my baby?

14:09.349 --> 14:11.518
(sobbing) Where's my baby?

14:11.602 --> 14:13.979
-Did you lose your baby?
-Yes!

14:14.062 --> 14:16.148
-Yes!
-I lost mine too.

14:17.441 --> 14:20.736
It was never born.
It's in the backyard with the rest of me.

14:20.819 --> 14:22.905
-It's not fair.
-No. It's not.

14:22.988 --> 14:25.824
How come she gets to have two,
and we don't get to have any?

14:25.908 --> 14:29.453
-Who?
-The bitch that stole your house, Vivien.

14:29.536 --> 14:32.080
She already has a daughter.
And what do we have?

14:32.164 --> 14:33.749
Heartache.

14:36.835 --> 14:38.504
(sobbing)

14:38.587 --> 14:41.757
She's having twins, you know.
We should take those babies.

14:42.299 --> 14:45.469
One for you, one for me.

14:46.220 --> 14:47.429
We could do that?

14:47.513 --> 14:49.264
We'll have to.

14:50.432 --> 14:52.601
After all, they've gotta have mothers.

14:54.353 --> 14:56.605
You can't raise a baby in the loony bin.

15:02.236 --> 15:04.947
(crickets chirping)

15:08.450 --> 15:10.369
You're just tired.

15:10.494 --> 15:12.162
(floorboard creaks)

15:21.755 --> 15:23.340
Violet?

15:23.465 --> 15:25.551
(door creaking)

15:48.574 --> 15:49.783
Hello?

16:00.961 --> 16:03.046
(electricity sputtering)

16:03.130 --> 16:04.756
-(pops)
-(screams)

16:04.840 --> 16:06.967
(Hayden laughing)

16:07.050 --> 16:08.260
(screams)

16:08.343 --> 16:10.137
(laughing continues)

16:10.220 --> 16:11.763
(moans sharply)

16:12.890 --> 16:15.893
(labored breathing) Who did that?

16:19.396 --> 16:20.731
(floorboards creaking)

16:27.571 --> 16:29.740
(screaming)

16:30.616 --> 16:31.825
No!

16:43.128 --> 16:44.421
(candlestick clatters)

17:16.954 --> 17:18.163
(neck snaps)

17:26.129 --> 17:27.548
What the hell did you do?

17:35.389 --> 17:36.598
(gasps)

17:38.267 --> 17:40.060
(grunting)

17:47.776 --> 17:49.695
(shouts)

18:21.935 --> 18:23.520
He's dead.

18:25.480 --> 18:27.191
This is wrong. It's all wrong.

18:32.112 --> 18:33.697
Who are you?

18:34.907 --> 18:38.202
What did you do to my house?
My belongings?

18:38.285 --> 18:41.121
I know you've suffered a long time.

18:41.205 --> 18:42.581
I'm here to help you.

18:42.664 --> 18:44.625
I need my baby. Where's my baby?

18:44.708 --> 18:47.336
They were fighting
and decided not to make one.

18:47.836 --> 18:51.089
Maybe now a new family will move in
and they can give you what you want.

18:52.132 --> 18:53.425
Yes.

18:54.718 --> 18:57.888
A baby. I just want my baby.

19:12.486 --> 19:14.071
You want to play?

19:15.405 --> 19:17.366
Come out. I won't hurt you.

19:20.118 --> 19:22.162
-Who you talking to?
-No one.

19:24.831 --> 19:27.084
Come upstairs.
There's something we need to discuss.

19:27.584 --> 19:29.336
A discussion? Oh, shit.

19:29.419 --> 19:31.588
BEN: <i>I just got off the phone</i>
<i>with Mrs. Levinson.</i>

19:31.672 --> 19:34.216
Violet, you haven't been
to school in two weeks.

19:35.425 --> 19:36.969
What is going on?

19:38.136 --> 19:39.221
I don't like it.

19:39.304 --> 19:41.014
It's boring, and they bully me.

19:41.098 --> 19:42.558
What does that mean?

19:42.641 --> 19:44.518
That is so you.

19:44.601 --> 19:47.271
Some kids say they're bullied and
their parents just pull them right out.

19:47.354 --> 19:48.856
You ask me to define bullying.

19:48.939 --> 19:51.483
-Have you told your mom about this?
-(chuckles)

19:51.567 --> 19:53.569
How is it that a big, fancy shrink

19:53.652 --> 19:55.946
hasn't noticed that his wife
has totally lost her shit?

19:58.657 --> 20:00.909
Violet, look at me.

20:00.993 --> 20:02.327
Look at me.

20:03.287 --> 20:04.955
What's going on with her?

20:05.038 --> 20:07.040
Well, when she's not in bed

20:07.124 --> 20:09.126
or worrying about absolutely everything,

20:09.209 --> 20:10.627
she's eating raw brains.

20:10.711 --> 20:13.797
Maybe she thinks the twins are stealing
hers 'cause that's kind of how it seems.

20:16.133 --> 20:19.553
Well, it sounds like, um,
your mom is depressed,

20:19.636 --> 20:22.598
and you're feeling
very alone and isolated.

20:22.681 --> 20:24.516
This isn't about me.

20:24.600 --> 20:26.602
I'm saying Mom's crazy,
and it's your fault.

20:26.685 --> 20:28.020
You drove her crazy.

20:28.103 --> 20:29.688
You're a cheater.

20:29.771 --> 20:31.690
Young girls,
old ladies with feather dusters.

20:31.773 --> 20:34.401
You're so weird and pathetic.
I'm surprised you haven't gone after me.

20:34.484 --> 20:36.403
I'm still your father.
Do not talk to me like that.

20:36.486 --> 20:37.738
I don't have anything more to say anyway.

20:37.821 --> 20:39.364
Session's over.

20:40.199 --> 20:41.366
Violet.

20:41.450 --> 20:42.910
(footsteps receding)

20:46.205 --> 20:48.373
(teakettle whistling)

20:50.501 --> 20:51.835
Madam, are you all right?

20:52.836 --> 20:55.005
It's my own fault. I...

20:56.965 --> 20:59.301
I read labels on everything,

20:59.384 --> 21:01.345
and then, when it really counted,
I just...

21:01.428 --> 21:03.388
I just followed directions blindly.

21:03.472 --> 21:05.807
My doctor gave me a prescription last week

21:05.891 --> 21:08.143
for a drug for nausea, and...

21:09.811 --> 21:11.522
I just checked it on the Internet,

21:11.605 --> 21:15.234
and it says that
it can cause fever and seizures

21:15.317 --> 21:17.152
and, um,

21:18.612 --> 21:20.572
vision changes.

21:20.656 --> 21:22.783
That's the only explanation.

21:24.034 --> 21:25.494
For what, madam?

21:25.577 --> 21:27.913
For all the crazy stuff
that's been happening.

21:29.540 --> 21:31.708
And my doctor never even told me
about the side effects.

21:33.252 --> 21:34.920
Doctors are charlatans.

21:38.090 --> 21:40.467
(whispering) My mind is playing
tricks on me, Moira.

21:42.719 --> 21:45.848
I'm literally seeing things.

21:49.977 --> 21:51.144
There, there, madam.

21:52.145 --> 21:53.480
(sniffles)

21:53.564 --> 21:55.065
You just need a good cry.

21:55.148 --> 21:57.985
Sometimes it's the best possible thing.

22:01.113 --> 22:04.408
(voice breaking) And everybody
thinks I'm crazy.

22:04.783 --> 22:06.535
I know Ben does. I know it.

22:07.661 --> 22:09.788
And I've been too embarrassed
to call Luke.

22:10.789 --> 22:12.583
That's what men do.

22:13.458 --> 22:16.670
They make you think you're crazy
so they can have their fun.

22:16.753 --> 22:19.923
Haven't you read <i>The Yellow Wallpaper</i>
by Charlotte Perkins Gilman?

22:20.007 --> 22:21.175
No.

22:21.258 --> 22:23.260
Her husband, a doctor,

22:23.802 --> 22:26.346
locks her away in the upstairs bedroom

22:26.430 --> 22:30.309
to recuperate
from a slight hysterical tendency.

22:30.392 --> 22:33.729
Staring at the yellow wallpaper
day after day,

22:35.189 --> 22:39.109
she begins to hallucinate that
there are women trapped in the pattern.

22:39.193 --> 22:40.819
Half mad,

22:41.987 --> 22:44.948
she scrapes off the wallpaper
to set the women free.

22:45.032 --> 22:48.327
When her husband finally unlocks the door,

22:48.410 --> 22:50.579
he finds her circling the room,

22:50.662 --> 22:52.122
touching the wallpaper,

22:52.206 --> 22:55.459
whispering, "I finally got out of here."

22:57.503 --> 22:59.171
Since the beginning of time,

23:00.088 --> 23:03.175
men find excuses to lock women away.

23:04.134 --> 23:08.180
They make up diseases, like hysteria.

23:09.306 --> 23:11.600
Do you know where that word comes from?

23:11.683 --> 23:12.893
No.

23:13.936 --> 23:16.021
The Greek word for uterus.

23:16.813 --> 23:20.442
In the second century, they thought
it was caused by sexual deprivation,

23:21.443 --> 23:25.405
and the only possible cure
was hysterical paroxysm.

23:27.449 --> 23:29.159
Orgasms.

23:29.243 --> 23:30.702
Doctors

23:31.662 --> 23:36.166
would masturbate women
in their office and call it medicine.

23:37.209 --> 23:38.752
I had no idea.

23:38.836 --> 23:42.464
It was a hundred years ago,
but we're no better off today.

23:43.674 --> 23:47.845
Men are still inventing ways
to drive women over the edge.

23:49.221 --> 23:51.765
Look at you and Mr. Harmon.

23:51.849 --> 23:54.101
Cheating on you and leaving you here,

23:54.184 --> 23:55.853
pregnant with twins, alone,

23:55.936 --> 23:57.896
to care for your truant teenage daughter.

23:57.980 --> 23:59.606
Any woman would lose her mind.

24:01.733 --> 24:04.695
May I speak freely, Mrs. Harmon?

24:04.778 --> 24:06.113
Yes.

24:06.196 --> 24:08.031
You are not crazy.

24:09.324 --> 24:12.703
And the strange things
you are experiencing,

24:12.786 --> 24:15.038
I'm afraid it's not the drugs.

24:15.122 --> 24:17.499
I've never said this
to any of my employers,

24:18.125 --> 24:21.128
for fear of losing their trust or my job,

24:22.546 --> 24:24.715
but this house is possessed.

24:24.798 --> 24:28.135
Things break, disappear.

24:28.218 --> 24:29.970
Doors open for no reason.

24:30.053 --> 24:32.973
There are spirits here.
Malevolent spirits.

24:33.682 --> 24:36.059
Mrs. Harmon, please hear me.

24:36.935 --> 24:39.521
You need to get out while you still can.

24:40.522 --> 24:42.191
I fear for you if you don't.

24:44.985 --> 24:47.487
Violet. Violet, wake up.

24:47.571 --> 24:49.573
We're leaving this house tonight.

24:49.656 --> 24:50.949
-We're going to Aunt Jo's.
-What?

24:51.033 --> 24:53.285
We're not spending another night here.
Now!

25:10.677 --> 25:13.931
(no audible dialogue)

25:20.562 --> 25:23.106
We don't have to be prisoners
to this house anymore.

25:23.357 --> 25:25.400
-Excuse me, ma'am. I'm hurt...
-Oh, my God!

25:25.484 --> 25:27.152
-...and needing some help.
-(Vivien screams)

25:27.236 --> 25:28.654
I know you, bitches. (screams)

25:28.737 --> 25:30.697
Go, Vi. Go!

25:31.740 --> 25:32.950
Go!

25:44.253 --> 25:45.796
BEN: I can't believe you were trying

25:45.879 --> 25:47.589
to take my daughter out of state.

25:47.673 --> 25:49.132
I won't let you do it, Vivien.

25:49.216 --> 25:52.344
I will not allow you to separate
Violet from me, or those babies.

25:52.427 --> 25:54.096
You're missing the point, Ben.

25:54.179 --> 25:56.849
The people who tried to murder
your wife and your daughter

25:56.932 --> 25:58.767
were here last night.

25:58.851 --> 26:00.519
The police say there
was no evidence of anyone...

26:00.602 --> 26:02.062
I know what the police said!

26:02.145 --> 26:03.605
They don't even think
they're in California.

26:03.689 --> 26:06.108
There was a report of a similar
home invasion in Wisconsin.

26:06.191 --> 26:08.986
They were six inches from my face, Ben.

26:09.069 --> 26:11.572
-You never fully dealt with this.
-(groans)

26:11.655 --> 26:13.448
It makes sense that in times of stress

26:13.532 --> 26:14.783
you would feel this way, Vivien.

26:14.867 --> 26:16.326
I swear to Christ.
If you're about to diagnose me

26:16.410 --> 26:17.911
with post-traumatic shock syndrome,

26:17.995 --> 26:19.788
I am gonna bash your goddamn face in.

26:19.872 --> 26:21.290
Fine.

26:22.249 --> 26:23.750
Let's discuss the brain eating.

26:23.834 --> 26:27.838
Let's talk about the dangers
of ingesting raw organs.

26:27.921 --> 26:30.674
Mad cow disease, Vivien.
Have you ever heard of that?

26:30.757 --> 26:33.677
If you don't believe me,
go talk to your daughter.

26:34.678 --> 26:36.138
Violet was there too.

26:49.109 --> 26:51.153
Did it hurt?

26:51.236 --> 26:53.113
The first time usually does.

26:54.239 --> 26:55.657
No.

26:55.949 --> 26:57.576
It was intense.

26:58.035 --> 26:59.828
For me too.

26:59.912 --> 27:01.538
You really are here,

27:02.956 --> 27:04.249
aren't you?

27:05.459 --> 27:06.835
Of course.

27:06.919 --> 27:08.504
I'll always be here.

27:09.880 --> 27:11.465
If that's what you want.

27:11.548 --> 27:14.635
They'll always be here too, won't they?

27:14.718 --> 27:16.637
The... Whatever. Others.

27:16.720 --> 27:18.472
They can't hurt us, Violet.

27:18.555 --> 27:21.808
Those freaks who tried
to kill me and my mom,

27:21.892 --> 27:23.769
they're dead, aren't they?

27:23.852 --> 27:25.687
We saw them outside last night.

27:25.771 --> 27:27.439
My mom's totally freaked out.

27:27.523 --> 27:29.566
She thinks they're back
to finish what they started.

27:29.650 --> 27:31.902
I mean, she called the police,
and my dad rushed over.

27:31.985 --> 27:33.612
They're just trying to scare you.

27:33.695 --> 27:34.780
That's all they can do now.

27:34.863 --> 27:36.240
I wish I could tell my mom that.

27:36.323 --> 27:39.701
You can't. You can't. You can't.

27:39.785 --> 27:41.537
Violet,

27:41.620 --> 27:43.872
if you tell anyone what we know,
they'll say you're crazy.

27:43.956 --> 27:45.499
They'll want to lock you up.

27:45.582 --> 27:47.376
They'll try to take you away from here.

27:48.460 --> 27:50.838
-We'd never see each other again.
-BEN: Violet.

27:50.921 --> 27:52.881
-Can you come downstairs?
-Coming.

27:52.965 --> 27:55.384
VIVIEN: You know what?
You can't force us to stay in California.

27:55.467 --> 27:57.094
You can't.
'Cause I'm getting out of this house.

27:57.177 --> 27:58.720
I am booking us tickets to Florida.

27:58.804 --> 28:00.514
I'll go to the courts if I have to.

28:00.597 --> 28:03.267
You're mentally unstable, Vivien.

28:03.350 --> 28:05.602
-You're seeing things.
-I'm seeing things.

28:05.686 --> 28:08.230
You mean the way you were seeing

28:08.313 --> 28:10.607
your little 10-year-old mistress?

28:10.691 --> 28:12.943
You're being stupid.

28:13.026 --> 28:16.113
The only stupid thing that I did
was not changing the alarm code

28:16.238 --> 28:17.823
after I kicked your ass out of here.

28:17.906 --> 28:20.367
Did you give it to her?
Is that how she's been getting in here?

28:20.450 --> 28:22.202
Vivien, you're coming unhinged.

28:22.286 --> 28:23.745
You never stopped seeing her.

28:23.829 --> 28:26.874
You went to Boston to see her,

28:26.957 --> 28:30.544
and one of your patients attacked us.

28:30.627 --> 28:31.920
Jesus, Ben.

28:32.004 --> 28:33.338
What the hell are you saying?

28:33.422 --> 28:35.507
Did you plan this whole thing
with your little whore?

28:35.591 --> 28:38.468
-Did you plan to gaslight me?
-Oh, my God.

28:38.552 --> 28:40.846
To get rid of me,
so she could come in and take my place?

28:40.929 --> 28:42.514
This is crazy talk, Vivien.

28:48.187 --> 28:50.022
-What is this?
-Where did you get that?

28:50.105 --> 28:52.065
It was put somewhere
so that I would see it.

28:52.149 --> 28:54.109
Did you tell her about our kinky night?

28:54.193 --> 28:56.153
Put it on for her?

28:56.236 --> 28:58.363
Put it on?

28:58.447 --> 29:00.365
I threw this out months ago.

29:01.742 --> 29:03.368
What's going on?

29:06.079 --> 29:10.000
Um, honey, would you please
just tell your dad about last night?

29:10.918 --> 29:12.503
Go on, honey. It's okay.

29:14.129 --> 29:16.924
I saw Mom really upset.

29:18.050 --> 29:19.927
Just tell him what you saw.

29:20.010 --> 29:21.553
What you told the police.

29:24.306 --> 29:27.476
I told them
what I thought you wanted me to tell them.

29:27.559 --> 29:30.729
-I didn't see anything.
-Violet.

29:32.397 --> 29:35.150
I'm sorry, Mom. I don't know what you saw.

29:35.234 --> 29:37.861
You were so upset, so I was upset.

29:37.945 --> 29:39.530
I still am.

29:40.197 --> 29:41.698
(exhales)

29:42.157 --> 29:43.408
BEN: Okay, honey, you can go.

29:54.753 --> 29:56.213
I'm staying here tonight.

29:56.296 --> 29:58.799
Sleeping in my office.

29:58.882 --> 30:00.551
I don't need your protection.

30:00.634 --> 30:03.595
It's not to protect you.
My daughter lives here too.

30:07.683 --> 30:10.936
Aw. Look at Little Lord Fauntleroy.

30:11.019 --> 30:13.313
Writing sorrowful sonnets in your head

30:13.397 --> 30:15.566
to that little nightingale bitch?

30:15.649 --> 30:19.570
"Adieu, nightingale.
Thy plaintive anthem fades."

30:19.653 --> 30:21.738
-That's Keats.
-Who gives a shit?

30:21.822 --> 30:24.157
You're like a girl,
sulking down here in the basement

30:24.241 --> 30:26.827
instead of doing something
about what's really bothering you.

30:26.910 --> 30:29.079
I'm tired of hurting people.

30:29.162 --> 30:31.790
Do you want her to go away?

30:31.874 --> 30:34.293
'Cause Vivien booked their tickets.
I heard her.

30:34.376 --> 30:35.878
You know what you have to do.

30:35.961 --> 30:37.838
Yeah, I do.

30:39.256 --> 30:41.633
I just have to prepare myself.

30:41.717 --> 30:43.051
It's not fun.

30:43.260 --> 30:44.845
You want to fool around

30:44.928 --> 30:46.513
while you work your way up to it?

30:49.725 --> 30:51.143
Come on.

30:52.728 --> 30:53.896
I'm not into it.

30:55.772 --> 30:59.026
What is it about being dead
that makes me so horny?

31:00.027 --> 31:01.111
Quit it.

31:02.821 --> 31:04.031
I'm in love.

31:07.492 --> 31:10.162
You better locate
your balls before you go in there!

31:10.245 --> 31:12.080
That bitch is tough!

31:12.664 --> 31:14.333
What on earth could be so urgent

31:14.416 --> 31:16.585
that I had to leave my open house
in Studio City

31:16.668 --> 31:18.921
and drive all the way over the hill?

31:20.297 --> 31:22.799
Well, firstly, I wanted to let you know

31:22.883 --> 31:25.177
that Violet and I
will be leaving here tomorrow

31:25.260 --> 31:26.887
to go stay at my sister's for a while.

31:26.970 --> 31:28.430
You couldn't tell me that by phone?

31:28.514 --> 31:30.682
Sit down, Marcy. I'm not finished.

31:32.601 --> 31:34.353
Where is Mr. Escandarian?

31:34.436 --> 31:36.813
We accepted his ridiculous,
low-ball offer,

31:36.939 --> 31:38.941
and now we have not received
an escrow check.

31:39.024 --> 31:40.776
Don't tell me you've screwed
this one up too, Marcy.

31:41.151 --> 31:43.987
You know, Vivien,
I have had it with your abuse.

31:44.071 --> 31:46.365
And for your information,
I've called Mr. Escandarian

31:46.448 --> 31:47.908
for two weeks, morning and night.

31:47.991 --> 31:49.576
The man won't return my calls.

31:49.660 --> 31:51.703
I wasn't here when he came back to visit.

31:51.787 --> 31:53.580
Did you tell him your ghost story?

31:53.664 --> 31:55.916
Maybe he laughed,
and you bit the man's head off.

31:55.999 --> 31:58.252
Excuse me, Marcy.

31:58.335 --> 32:01.338
I'm not crazy. I'm just pregnant.

32:03.048 --> 32:04.633
Oh, God.

32:06.134 --> 32:08.762
And nauseous and dizzy. (groans)

32:10.556 --> 32:12.850
And blinded by migraines. Mrs. Harmon?

32:12.933 --> 32:14.810
-What? What just happened?
-(groans)

32:15.227 --> 32:16.937
Could you get me a glass of water, please?

32:17.020 --> 32:18.355
Just don't have the baby now.

32:18.438 --> 32:19.898
That's the last thing you want to do.

32:31.076 --> 32:33.203
MARCY: Okay. It's okay.

32:33.287 --> 32:35.789
-Oh, golly.
-Here we go. Right here.

32:35.873 --> 32:37.875
Oh, thank you. Yeah.

32:40.836 --> 32:42.504
Oh, boy.

32:42.588 --> 32:44.131
Oh, I'm sorry, Marcy.

32:44.214 --> 32:46.175
I think I'm gonna have to lie down
for a little while.

32:46.675 --> 32:48.093
Of course.

32:48.177 --> 32:49.803
I'll, uh, show myself out.

32:49.887 --> 32:51.889
Oh, thank you. That's wonderful.

32:54.308 --> 32:56.185
(door closes)

33:55.786 --> 33:57.871
(floorboards creaking)

34:38.954 --> 34:41.456
(screaming)

34:41.540 --> 34:43.750
(panting)

34:46.962 --> 34:49.089
(beeping)

34:52.926 --> 34:54.219
(screams)

35:03.729 --> 35:06.148
(sirens wailing)

35:09.860 --> 35:12.321
(police radio chatter)

35:12.404 --> 35:13.739
You need to be seen by a doctor.

35:13.822 --> 35:15.574
No, it was a through-and-through.
I'm fine.

35:15.657 --> 35:17.242
-What happened?
-We're fine.

35:17.326 --> 35:19.119
As you can see, I'm in good hands.

35:19.203 --> 35:21.330
-I want to talk to Mrs. Harmon.
-Well, you can't.

35:21.413 --> 35:23.790
She's very upset.
I gave her a Valium to help her sleep.

35:23.874 --> 35:26.210
I'm with Heirloom Security.
I got an emergency alert that...

35:26.293 --> 35:27.336
You want an update, Luke?

35:27.419 --> 35:28.670
Vivien thought there
was someone in the house.

35:28.754 --> 35:30.964
When I went up to help her,
she accidentally shot me.

35:31.048 --> 35:33.091
-That's the whole goddamn story.
-LUKE: The whole story?

35:33.175 --> 35:34.801
Did you guys talk to Mrs. Harmon?

35:34.885 --> 35:36.053
We've got this under control.

35:36.136 --> 35:37.971
So did he tell you that he doesn't
currently reside here?

35:38.055 --> 35:39.348
That they're separated?

35:39.431 --> 35:41.266
-He did tell you that, didn't he?
-You son of a bitch.

35:41.350 --> 35:43.644
Did he also tell you that he has
a mistress with a criminal record?

35:43.727 --> 35:45.646
-He told you that too, right?
-I'm a licensed psychiatrist.

35:45.729 --> 35:48.440
I know a psychotic break when I see one.

35:48.524 --> 35:51.151
My wife is a danger
to herself and to others.

35:51.235 --> 35:53.403
So you want to ship her off
to the loony bin,

35:53.487 --> 35:55.906
so you get the house, the kids,
the mistress and the dog, huh?

35:55.989 --> 35:58.534
Look, I don't know
who you think you are to my wife,

35:58.617 --> 36:00.536
but this is still my goddamn house,

36:00.619 --> 36:02.287
and you need to get the hell out.

36:07.793 --> 36:09.878
(voices whispering)

36:17.344 --> 36:18.929
Wake up!

36:21.932 --> 36:23.016
(moans)

36:27.479 --> 36:29.857
HAYDEN (shouting):
Looking for your lifeline?

36:30.482 --> 36:32.442
(grunts)

36:32.526 --> 36:34.069
Hayden...

36:35.028 --> 36:38.073
Hayden, Ben and I are separated.

36:38.156 --> 36:39.616
You can have him all to yourself.

36:39.700 --> 36:42.411
I don't want him. He's pathetic.

36:42.494 --> 36:44.454
I know. I agree.

36:45.330 --> 36:46.582
He is pathetic.

36:46.665 --> 36:48.792
VIVIEN: <i>And he's an asshole.</i>

36:48.876 --> 36:50.711
And he is an asshole.

36:51.461 --> 36:53.213
<i>He's hurt us both</i><i>very badly.</i>

36:53.297 --> 36:57.009
And he has hurt us both so much, so...

36:57.092 --> 36:59.511
So you should leave it,
just leave it alone.

36:59.887 --> 37:01.930
Can't, Viv.

37:02.014 --> 37:04.683
I used to think I was so privileged.

37:04.766 --> 37:08.437
White, beautiful, educated.

37:08.520 --> 37:10.939
But I've been deprived.

37:11.023 --> 37:12.816
I have needs,

37:12.900 --> 37:15.485
terrible, gnawing needs.

37:15.569 --> 37:17.446
What do you want?

37:18.280 --> 37:20.782
I want what's in your womb.

37:20.866 --> 37:23.368
-I want those babies.
-That's sick.

37:23.702 --> 37:25.537
You're sick, Hayden.

37:25.621 --> 37:28.290
No. I'm dead.

37:28.373 --> 37:29.750
Dead! Dead.

37:30.626 --> 37:32.961
And I have a surprise for you.

37:33.045 --> 37:35.214
The father of your babies,

37:35.297 --> 37:36.715
he's right there.

37:37.674 --> 37:41.053
(screams) No. No. No.

37:41.345 --> 37:42.763
(grunting)

37:44.890 --> 37:47.601
He liked it so much the first time,
he's going for round two.

37:47.684 --> 37:50.145
(Vivien grunting)

37:50.229 --> 37:53.440
VIVIEN: No! No! No!

37:56.109 --> 37:59.488
-No! Get off of me!
-I'm not gonna hurt you.

37:59.571 --> 38:01.198
(whimpering) I'm not gonna hurt you.

38:02.658 --> 38:05.327
(gasps) Wh... Where'd he go?

38:05.410 --> 38:06.745
I'm right here.

38:08.747 --> 38:10.082
Where is he?

38:11.458 --> 38:14.503
Did you see him? Where did he go?

38:14.586 --> 38:17.089
Who? Who, Vivien?

38:18.715 --> 38:20.300
The g... The guy.

38:20.384 --> 38:22.177
The rapist in the... In the suit.

38:22.261 --> 38:23.804
He was right here.

38:23.887 --> 38:25.264
He was right here.

38:25.347 --> 38:27.683
-The guy in what suit?
-Did you get him?

38:28.934 --> 38:31.395
Ben knows. He was in
the rubber suit from the attic.

38:32.521 --> 38:34.481
And... And Hayden was here.

38:36.608 --> 38:38.443
She said that she... She was dead,

38:38.527 --> 38:40.445
and she said she wanted our babies.

38:40.529 --> 38:41.822
She's here.

38:41.905 --> 38:43.407
-Vivien.
-Hayden!

38:43.866 --> 38:45.617
-Did you see her?
-Viv?

38:45.701 --> 38:47.536
How could you not have seen them?
They were here.

38:47.619 --> 38:49.162
They were right here.

38:50.622 --> 38:51.874
I don't see her, Vivien.

38:51.957 --> 38:53.750
Well, they've gotta be
in the house somewhere.

38:58.463 --> 38:59.923
They're ready for her.

39:08.765 --> 39:10.184
What's going on?

39:13.562 --> 39:15.063
I had to do it, Vivien.

39:17.316 --> 39:18.901
You're unstable...

39:20.110 --> 39:23.530
-No.
-...and you need to be evaluated.

39:26.074 --> 39:28.493
These men are gonna
take you to a hospital.

39:30.037 --> 39:32.039
(whispering) I'm so sorry,

39:32.789 --> 39:34.875
but it's the best alternative.

39:34.958 --> 39:36.919
I didn't want to do it.

39:37.002 --> 39:38.629
You shot me, sweetheart.

39:39.046 --> 39:41.215
-It's gotten dangerous.
-But I wasn't shooting you.

39:41.298 --> 39:45.302
I was shooting the...
The rapist in the rubber suit.

39:54.269 --> 39:56.104
-(handcuffs jingle)
-That's not necessary.

39:56.188 --> 39:58.899
Ben, could you get my coat for me, please?

40:07.574 --> 40:08.867
Thank you.

40:12.955 --> 40:15.207
You won't be needing that, ma'am.

40:22.673 --> 40:24.800
I'm so sorry, Vivien.

40:24.883 --> 40:26.468
It's okay.

40:27.803 --> 40:29.638
At least I'll be out of this house.

40:53.370 --> 40:54.663
This is all my fault.

40:55.914 --> 40:58.208
No, honey. It's not.

40:59.710 --> 41:01.628
You did the best thing you could do.

41:01.712 --> 41:02.963
You told the truth.

41:18.187 --> 41:19.396
It's okay.

41:19.479 --> 41:21.106
I'm here.

41:37.748 --> 41:39.666
(snap)

41:39.750 --> 41:41.376
(gurgling)

41:41.460 --> 41:42.920
Not this way.

41:46.340 --> 41:48.383
These boys have family, friends.

41:48.467 --> 41:49.801
They will be missed.

41:49.885 --> 41:51.803
The police will come looking for a killer.

41:51.887 --> 41:53.305
You want them to find you?

41:53.388 --> 41:54.973
TATE: I'm open to suggestions.

41:55.057 --> 41:56.975
MOIRA: I think you should get over
your compulsive need

41:57.059 --> 41:58.769
to please the ladies of this house.

41:58.852 --> 42:00.604
I think I have Mommy issues.

42:00.687 --> 42:02.856
You know a good therapist?

42:02.940 --> 42:05.400
Use this. It belongs to them.

42:07.069 --> 42:08.987
(cocks gun)

42:12.115 --> 42:13.408
(grunts)

42:31.426 --> 42:33.178
TATE: It's kind of romantic, isn't it?

42:33.262 --> 42:35.222
Now they'll be together forever.

42:52.739 --> 42:54.366
(door slams)

42:57.244 --> 42:59.246
<i>(♪♪♪)</i>
