WEBVTT

00:05.380 --> 00:07.798
Hey, everybody!
It's closing time

00:08.425 --> 00:10.718
You don't gotta go home
but you can't stay here.

00:16.850 --> 00:18.851
Closing time!

00:19.436 --> 00:22.521
Every office needs an
end-of-the-day tradition

00:23.148 --> 00:24.648
Something to tell you
the day's over.

00:24.733 --> 00:27.192
Otherwise, you go home and the
night just feels like more day.

00:27.277 --> 00:28.318
It's weird

00:28.403 --> 00:29.611
Closing time!

00:29.738 --> 00:30.946
W, R, K

00:31.031 --> 00:32.781
One last call
for alcohol so...

00:32.866 --> 00:35.034
No, it's W, R, K
as in kitten?

00:35.118 --> 00:36.368
...so finish your
whiskey or beer!

00:36.453 --> 00:37.619
Oh, my boss is
singing Closing Time,

00:37.746 --> 00:38.912
maybe that's
what you're hearing

00:38.997 --> 00:39.997
Come on, Pam

00:40.081 --> 00:41.749
Closing time!

00:42.625 --> 00:48.714
Time for you to go home
to the places you will be from

00:49.466 --> 00:53.135
Let's see Andy has been
manager for 105 days,

00:53.511 --> 00:58.307
which means I've heard
Closing Time 105 times

00:58.975 --> 01:01.060
Still don't know the words

01:03.063 --> 01:05.438
Home and home and home

01:06.441 --> 01:10.819
I know who I want
to take me home!

01:11.446 --> 01:21.121
I know who I want
to take me home

01:21.289 --> 01:23.040
Take me home

01:25.919 --> 01:28.629
You know what? Fine! I try to
start fun traditions for you guys

01:28.713 --> 01:31.298
but if you don't want
to sing, no traditions

01:32.217 --> 01:34.468
Closing time!

01:35.011 --> 01:37.012
Every new beginning...

01:37.222 --> 01:41.642
I never heard that song before and
once I heard it I did not care for it.

01:41.726 --> 01:44.520
But that song means
it's time to go home.

01:44.896 --> 01:47.439
Now, it's my favourite song

01:48.274 --> 01:54.988
Every new beginning comes from
some other beginning's end

01:55.323 --> 01:56.698
Good night

01:58.000 --> 02:04.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:28.189 --> 02:30.607
This report is atrocious Who's
your favourite Iron Chef?

02:31.067 --> 02:32.526
You go first

02:34.154 --> 02:37.406
The ticketing software
paints a picture

02:37.490 --> 02:41.493
of a sloppy, careless
error-prone office.

02:42.453 --> 02:45.247
Well, the monitoring software
is a double-edged sword.

02:45.415 --> 02:46.623
Sometimes the

02:46.708 --> 02:47.916
Sorry. Go ahead

02:48.418 --> 02:49.751
Mmm-hmm

02:52.130 --> 02:53.755
Did you need
something from us?

02:54.883 --> 02:55.924
Yes

02:58.178 --> 03:00.304
Your attention
because...

03:03.349 --> 03:04.933
No. That is all

03:11.858 --> 03:14.151
Last night I dreamed
that the number two

03:14.277 --> 03:16.612
was the most valued
number in the world.

03:17.238 --> 03:19.281
The Vice President
had all the power,

03:19.490 --> 03:21.783
athletes fought
for silver medals,

03:21.993 --> 03:24.036
women were considered
the best gender.

03:24.495 --> 03:28.248
And stadiums of fans shouted,
"We're number two!"

03:30.543 --> 03:32.628
As with all my dreams,
I'm guessing

03:32.795 --> 03:34.880
it was about
my fear of immigrants

03:35.548 --> 03:37.382
Last week, an accounting
mistake resulted in

03:37.467 --> 03:39.218
a client getting
their order for free

03:39.302 --> 03:41.720
Ho! That's not good

03:41.804 --> 03:44.306
Chalk that one up to "Tweedle-Dee'
and "Tweedle-Dum" out there

03:44.724 --> 03:46.642
Who are they?
They're both Kevin

03:46.768 --> 03:48.727
Oscar's the
Sex and the City gang,

03:48.811 --> 03:50.729
and Angela, if you can

03:50.813 --> 03:53.899
Andy, sometimes I feel like
you don't know me at all.

03:54.317 --> 03:55.317
I would agree with that

03:55.401 --> 03:57.819
Simply end the mistakes

03:58.404 --> 03:59.404
End the mistakes. Easy

03:59.489 --> 04:03.575
When I come back next week, and this
report shows me "No mistakes, '

04:03.660 --> 04:06.453
we can talk
about names all day

04:06.829 --> 04:09.248
Our favourite names,
silly made-up names

04:09.332 --> 04:12.668
normal names said in a silly voice.
Wouldn't that be nice?

04:13.503 --> 04:14.503
I would like that

04:14.587 --> 04:16.213
End the mistakes

04:16.547 --> 04:18.173
That's all I ask

04:19.716 --> 04:21.843
And you can't have
a favorite Iron Chef

04:21.928 --> 04:24.972
It depends entirely on
the secret ingredient

04:25.556 --> 04:29.518
Sometimes I feel you
don't know food at all

04:34.357 --> 04:35.774
I'm just saying,
with the NBA lockout

04:35.858 --> 04:37.943
I think roller derby's in a
really good place right now.

04:38.027 --> 04:41.697
So, my pitch is, me, Pam
you and someone else

04:42.031 --> 04:43.407
maybe Justine

04:44.367 --> 04:45.993
No. Not Justine

04:46.536 --> 04:47.703
Never Justine

04:48.037 --> 04:49.079
Is that off again?

04:49.163 --> 04:50.247
Oh, yeah.
Okay

04:50.331 --> 04:53.375
Hey, mandatory warehouse
safety meeting today.

04:54.127 --> 04:56.253
We don't really do those
We just sign the thing.

04:56.879 --> 04:58.255
Are you really this lazy?

05:00.133 --> 05:01.508
I'll be there

05:03.052 --> 05:04.386
Hey
Hey

05:05.513 --> 05:07.180
Mondays suck

05:07.348 --> 05:08.682
Yeah. Yep

05:11.728 --> 05:13.395
Just trying to

05:16.065 --> 05:19.735
I may have a little solution
to our mistakes problem.

05:20.695 --> 05:23.030
This is a project I've been
working on for quite some time.

05:23.114 --> 05:25.157
And today might be
the day to use it.

05:25.241 --> 05:26.283
What've you got?

05:26.909 --> 05:28.160
Allow me

05:31.831 --> 05:33.749
You're gonna love this

05:35.585 --> 05:36.793
Should've used
a shorter string.

05:36.919 --> 05:38.128
Never mind
I know it by heart

05:38.338 --> 05:42.466
It is a system that holds people
accountable for everyone else's work.

05:42.925 --> 05:44.009
Sounds controversial

05:44.427 --> 05:45.969
Have I not been
worthy of your trust?

05:46.929 --> 05:49.097
Have I not been
a reliable number two?

05:49.432 --> 05:51.058
Do not go there

05:52.101 --> 05:54.311
You're the deuce
I never want to drop

05:54.562 --> 05:56.855
Well, I can make this work

05:56.939 --> 05:58.899
I'll set it up right now.
I just need your go ahead

05:59.192 --> 06:01.860
Go do the voodoo
that you do so we

06:01.944 --> 06:02.986
I will do my voodoo

06:03.071 --> 06:04.237
Mmm-hmm

06:05.531 --> 06:07.282
Hey. I need you to get
the paperwork rolling

06:07.408 --> 06:09.117
on a new
workplace relationship

06:09.202 --> 06:10.202
For you?

06:10.286 --> 06:11.244
Yes, for Gabe

06:11.329 --> 06:12.496
Who are you seeing?
That's great

06:12.580 --> 06:15.957
Whom I am seeing is Val,
from down in the warehouse

06:16.584 --> 06:18.585
I'm not technically
seeing her

06:18.711 --> 06:20.712
but, I've seen
her with the eyes

06:20.797 --> 06:24.091
And there was attraction in
at least one direction, so...

06:26.636 --> 06:29.638
You know, I don't have to do paperwork
unless you're actually dating.

06:30.139 --> 06:32.516
Okay. Well, once this starts
it's gonna be moving fast,

06:32.600 --> 06:34.142
it's gonna be hot and heavy
and I don't want

06:34.227 --> 06:35.727
a bunch of
bureaucratic red tape

06:35.812 --> 06:37.270
wrapped around my jock
you know?

06:37.522 --> 06:39.856
But I mean, well, have
you talked to her?

06:39.941 --> 06:42.692
Yeah. We had a whole
conversation about Mondays

06:43.194 --> 06:45.278
Do you know
her last name yet?

06:45.363 --> 06:47.364
Toby, I'm gonna tell you
her last name tomorrow

06:47.448 --> 06:49.408
because she's gonna be
screaming it tonight.

06:49.492 --> 06:51.410
She's gonna be screaming
her own last name?

06:51.619 --> 06:53.370
Hey, watch it

06:54.622 --> 06:56.039
Good luck, Gabe

06:56.332 --> 06:57.499
Hi, guys
Hi.

06:57.583 --> 07:01.753
I just wanna say that you all have
been doing amazing work, really.

07:01.838 --> 07:03.630
Thank you.
And I'd like to add

07:03.714 --> 07:05.549
that your work has
been a little sloppy

07:05.675 --> 07:08.343
So, Dwight and I
have implemented

07:08.469 --> 07:11.138
a new program that
we like to call...

07:11.806 --> 07:12.931
...Dwight?

07:13.057 --> 07:14.224
The Accountability Booster

07:14.684 --> 07:17.769
It registers every time a mistake
has been made in the office,

07:17.854 --> 07:20.689
from a late delivery
to an accounting error

07:20.815 --> 07:24.192
Five strikes in a day
equals a home run

07:24.277 --> 07:26.027
One home run
and you're out

07:26.779 --> 07:29.865
If we as a group make
five mistakes in a day

07:29.991 --> 07:33.368
something bad happens
Like, we block Minesweeper

07:33.536 --> 07:36.288
Or, in this case, an e-mail
gets sent to Robert California

07:36.372 --> 07:38.123
containing the consultant's
report from last year.

07:38.207 --> 07:40.542
Remember the one that recommended
the branch be shut down?

07:40.626 --> 07:42.711
What?
And, as a failsafe, also

07:42.795 --> 07:45.881
every negative e-mail you've ever
written about him to the group

07:45.965 --> 07:47.090
will also be
forwarded to him

07:47.175 --> 07:48.508
What e-mails are
you talking about?

07:48.593 --> 07:52.929
Robert's favorite songs, Creep
by TLC Creep by Radiohead.

07:53.014 --> 07:54.556
You remember that one, Jim?

07:55.057 --> 07:57.851
"There's no way he hasn't
strangled at least one stripper.'

07:57.935 --> 07:59.102
Oscar

07:59.562 --> 08:02.981
"He eats his yogurt like he is
punishing it for disappointing him.'

08:03.065 --> 08:04.149
Kelly

08:04.233 --> 08:05.233
That's not that
bad, actually.

08:05.735 --> 08:07.068
PS, "We should
kill him."

08:08.237 --> 08:10.697
Wait. So, you installed
a doomsday device?

08:10.781 --> 08:12.491
No, it's an
Accountability Booster

08:12.575 --> 08:14.659
Which, when it goes off
it destroys everything

08:14.744 --> 08:16.077
very similar to
a doomsday device

08:16.162 --> 08:18.997
Jim, you're trying to make me sound
like some kind of evil maniac

08:19.081 --> 08:22.042
No, the point is, is that we are
now working in an environment

08:22.126 --> 08:25.420
where we have accountability
to each other

08:25.588 --> 08:28.298
I am confident that you
guys are equal to the task

08:28.799 --> 08:32.344
No, we're not. And you are a
psycho who is ruining our lives

08:32.428 --> 08:34.095
We can't do this, Dwight.
We can't

08:35.431 --> 08:36.765
Smile

08:37.099 --> 08:38.808
Nod. Smile and nod

08:39.101 --> 08:41.186
They're making me out
to be a Bond villain.

08:41.270 --> 08:43.938
I like to think of myself
as a brilliant scientist

08:44.106 --> 08:46.816
who will stop at nothing
to remake the world.

08:47.401 --> 08:48.485
Like

08:50.112 --> 08:52.447
Not Doctor Moreau
someone good

08:53.991 --> 08:56.076
Doctor Frankenstein

08:56.160 --> 08:58.119
Doctor Jekyll, not them

08:59.997 --> 09:01.623
Doctor

09:05.127 --> 09:07.170
Are you sure
this is a good idea?

09:07.255 --> 09:10.257
I mean, the thing about this office
is we make a lot of mistakes

09:10.466 --> 09:12.425
But the device
will change that

09:12.510 --> 09:14.844
Without a safety net
people will improve.

09:18.975 --> 09:21.643
All right, everybody, looks like
we need to be getting to work.

09:21.727 --> 09:24.521
Be extra careful,
double-check everything

09:24.647 --> 09:26.690
Or the Accountability Booster
will get you.

09:26.774 --> 09:30.068
This doomsday device sounds
like a scare tactic to me.

09:30.152 --> 09:32.737
There's an easy way to tell
if this device is a sham,

09:32.822 --> 09:34.698
we just make a mistake

09:35.032 --> 09:38.285
I'll send an order down to shipping
before we've received payment

09:45.585 --> 09:47.419
There's one mistake

09:47.503 --> 09:49.504
Now we only have four strikes
left until a home run.

09:49.589 --> 09:51.673
Dwight's our co-worker
and he worked really hard

09:51.757 --> 09:53.133
on this doomsday
device. So, I...

09:53.217 --> 09:55.760
it's not a doomsday
device! Gosh!

09:56.846 --> 09:58.513
We can do this, you guys

09:59.098 --> 10:00.181
First

10:00.266 --> 10:01.766
Second
it's not a race.

10:04.312 --> 10:05.437
Third

10:06.022 --> 10:07.314
Who knows
what the belt is for?

10:07.398 --> 10:08.773
It's for
protecting my ass

10:08.858 --> 10:10.525
when you suckers lift
more than you can handle.

10:10.943 --> 10:11.985
What's up? I'm Gabe

10:12.528 --> 10:14.029
Corporate. Continue

10:14.238 --> 10:15.488
Don't be nervous

10:15.740 --> 10:17.032
Apparently,
we have a visitor

10:17.116 --> 10:18.116
Gabe, everyone

10:18.367 --> 10:19.367
Hi, Gabe

10:20.202 --> 10:22.912
All right so the support belt.
Now this one is mine

10:22.997 --> 10:24.706
Doesn't get much
use nowadays.

10:24.874 --> 10:26.625
Look at this.
This is enormous

10:30.087 --> 10:33.214
I get the sense that Val
enjoys a good put-down

10:33.382 --> 10:35.216
Considering that's the only
thing I know about her,

10:35.343 --> 10:37.719
I will be milking that hard

10:38.471 --> 10:40.221
It's like a hula-hoop
right?

10:40.765 --> 10:44.142
Mele Kalikimaka
is Hawaii's way

10:46.979 --> 10:47.979
You done?

10:48.064 --> 10:50.732
The Michelin Man called,
he wants his cummerbund back

10:52.193 --> 10:55.195
Remember, we have to get Regal
Escrow their refund by 5:00.

10:55.613 --> 10:56.613
I'm on it

10:56.781 --> 10:58.907
Kevin, maybe I
should handle that.

10:59.283 --> 11:01.868
We really need you to
focus on your project.

11:02.078 --> 11:03.328
Good thinking

11:03.412 --> 11:06.414
Apparently a big client
for this company

11:06.499 --> 11:09.584
needs to know the story
of how paper gets made

11:12.421 --> 11:14.798
Oscar, use a calculator

11:18.511 --> 11:22.222
When the stakes are this high there's
only one computer that I trust

11:22.556 --> 11:25.600
And it's powered by
Thai food and Spanish reds

11:26.143 --> 11:27.394
All right, everybody
you're doing great.

11:27.478 --> 11:30.355
Well, I wouldn't say that. Three
mistakes already is pretty terrible

11:30.439 --> 11:31.648
But I do see
improvement

11:31.732 --> 11:33.441
Meredith kept someone
on hold for 30 minutes,

11:33.526 --> 11:35.568
and now look
she's hard at work

11:36.612 --> 11:38.029
Dwight, question.
No questions

11:38.114 --> 11:39.614
If this doomsday
device goes off

11:39.699 --> 11:40.782
Accountability Booster

11:40.908 --> 11:41.991
If this bad idea goes off

11:42.076 --> 11:44.536
and we all lose our jobs, are
you gonna feel good about that?

11:44.620 --> 11:45.912
I haven't even
considered it

11:45.996 --> 11:49.374
That's how sure I am that this
Accountability Booster is gonna work

11:50.126 --> 11:51.501
Try "Mose-1-2-3-4.'

11:51.585 --> 11:53.753
Dwight would never be that
obvious Try something like...

11:53.838 --> 11:56.715
"Z-6-4-$-8.'

11:57.299 --> 11:59.718
Not that exactly, Jim
something like that

11:59.802 --> 12:00.760
Okay

12:00.845 --> 12:03.388
How about
"Scranton-Strangler-6-6-6"?

12:04.724 --> 12:05.807
Nope
No?

12:05.891 --> 12:07.058
Aw...

12:07.143 --> 12:08.643
Shoot.

12:08.769 --> 12:11.354
You guys are never gonna
shut down the machine, okay?

12:11.605 --> 12:13.690
But I appreciate your energy
and your teamwork

12:13.774 --> 12:15.442
You apply this to
your regular work

12:15.526 --> 12:17.068
you won't even notice
that the device is there

12:17.153 --> 12:18.570
watching you
ready to strike

12:21.031 --> 12:22.365
What's Dwight's
mother's name?

12:22.992 --> 12:24.159
Hedda

12:26.871 --> 12:27.871
No

12:27.955 --> 12:29.998
Once you've read
the packet, sign the back

12:30.082 --> 12:31.750
Hey, Darryl.
I was thinking

12:31.834 --> 12:33.168
maybe while we
read through this

12:33.335 --> 12:34.711
you could grab us
all some coffee?

12:35.045 --> 12:36.337
My treat

12:37.047 --> 12:38.465
Here's a $100 bill

12:38.549 --> 12:40.133
That should cover it
I think.

12:40.259 --> 12:42.469
Don't bring me any of that
caramel soy latte crap, okay?

12:42.553 --> 12:44.846
I want a decaf
frappuccino.

12:44.930 --> 12:45.930
Val?

12:46.015 --> 12:48.016
Actually, Val
why don't you come with?

12:48.100 --> 12:50.018
I'll need the extra hands
to carry them back.

12:50.102 --> 12:51.102
Yeah, sure

12:51.187 --> 12:52.312
Mmm-hmm

12:53.606 --> 12:54.647
Caramel soy latte

12:54.774 --> 12:55.815
No, a decaf frap

12:55.900 --> 12:57.108
Got it

12:59.737 --> 13:02.614
You sent the late notice to
Rinehart and Wolfe, right?

13:03.199 --> 13:04.365
Mmm-hmm. 64620

13:07.703 --> 13:08.953
Nuh-uh.
Yes

13:09.038 --> 13:10.997
588 plus 15%

13:13.793 --> 13:15.710
Oh, no!
- What does this mean?

13:16.086 --> 13:17.629
What does it mean?
- Andy.

13:17.713 --> 13:18.963
Oh

13:20.424 --> 13:21.508
God

13:21.842 --> 13:22.967
That's five strikes

13:23.552 --> 13:24.636
Well

13:25.387 --> 13:28.890
I was saving this for my
retirement which I guess is today

13:29.016 --> 13:30.183
Dwight, we got
five strikes.

13:31.811 --> 13:32.894
Really?

13:33.062 --> 13:34.145
Did the e-ma
go out or...

13:34.230 --> 13:35.688
It goes out automatically
at 5:00 p.m

13:35.773 --> 13:37.774
Well, then there's
gotta be a way to stop it

13:37.942 --> 13:40.401
Well, I would have to enter my
password in order to cancel it.

13:40.778 --> 13:41.903
Okay

13:41.987 --> 13:44.364
Dwight, you may now
enter your password.

13:44.990 --> 13:45.990
No

13:46.075 --> 13:47.158
What?
What?

13:47.243 --> 13:49.077
You don't deserve
to have this branch

13:49.161 --> 13:51.871
Five mistakes in
less than a day?

13:51.956 --> 13:53.164
We did our best

13:53.249 --> 13:54.999
No, you didn't, Phyllis

13:55.084 --> 13:56.501
You complained
the whole time,

13:56.585 --> 13:58.878
you yelled at me you tried
to break into the machine.

14:00.089 --> 14:01.172
What?

14:01.257 --> 14:03.049
You're a real crumb bum
you know that?

14:03.133 --> 14:05.134
Hey, you can't
just change the rules

14:05.219 --> 14:07.178
because you don't
like the outcome.

14:07.263 --> 14:09.973
What about you, Kevin? What
about you and your fake task?

14:10.057 --> 14:12.100
Can you tell me now
where paper comes from?

14:13.352 --> 14:15.603
The man tree
puts its penis

14:15.729 --> 14:17.689
Okay. All right, Andy,
back me up here, please

14:17.773 --> 14:18.773
No

14:19.024 --> 14:20.024
What?
No

14:20.109 --> 14:22.777
Dwight, be human for once
shut down the machine.

14:22.862 --> 14:24.654
Shut it down
Shut it down.

14:24.738 --> 14:26.030
Shut down the machine

14:26.115 --> 14:27.365
Shut it down

14:29.076 --> 14:31.619
good luck finding
a new job, idiots

14:31.745 --> 14:34.289
I'll make sure to write
you a glowing reference

14:34.373 --> 14:36.124
Glowingly negative

14:38.919 --> 14:40.086
Dwight's car is gone

14:40.754 --> 14:41.713
I bet he went home

14:41.797 --> 14:44.591
Some of us should go there, try
to talk some sense into him.

14:44.675 --> 14:46.467
Get him to stop that e-mail

14:46.552 --> 14:49.470
Pam, you should come with
me. Dwight really likes you,

14:49.930 --> 14:51.556
and your breasts are
enormous, that could help us

14:52.099 --> 14:53.808
Kevin has that lovability

14:54.268 --> 14:55.768
Guys, come on

14:56.145 --> 14:57.228
I'm right here

14:57.313 --> 15:00.148
Jim, I want you to go find Robert.
Just be where he is

15:00.232 --> 15:02.609
in case that e-ma
goes out at 5:00,

15:02.693 --> 15:04.986
you can try to
delete it or something

15:05.070 --> 15:06.237
Okay. Where is he?

15:06.322 --> 15:09.490
He's at some club where you
either eat squash or play squash

15:10.868 --> 15:12.368
I'll try both

15:13.329 --> 15:14.579
Oh

15:14.663 --> 15:16.831
Did you come to
reason with me?

15:17.207 --> 15:18.458
Got you something

15:23.255 --> 15:26.674
And I just really
want to talk to you

15:26.842 --> 15:28.134
Get lost

15:28.302 --> 15:29.761
Well, now hold on

15:29.845 --> 15:30.887
What are you doing?

15:32.097 --> 15:33.473
What does it
look like I'm doing?

15:33.557 --> 15:35.016
Digging a grave
for a horse

15:38.354 --> 15:39.395
Do you need a hand?

15:40.856 --> 15:42.690
Yeah, you need a hand?

15:49.448 --> 15:52.075
If you hit another horse
you've dug too far

15:52.743 --> 15:54.953
I'll see you
next week, Will.

15:55.162 --> 15:56.371
Robert

15:57.039 --> 15:58.748
Jim, what are you

15:58.832 --> 15:59.874
What a surprise

15:59.959 --> 16:02.835
Yeah. Well, you know I just had
a meeting, a squash meeting

16:02.920 --> 16:04.045
Yeah?

16:05.381 --> 16:06.422
You up for a game?

16:06.507 --> 16:07.882
A game? Or a match?

16:09.051 --> 16:10.802
Exactly! Here we go

16:11.053 --> 16:12.053
Let's do it

16:17.059 --> 16:18.810
Are you okay, Kevin?

16:22.314 --> 16:23.314
Where are you going?

16:23.399 --> 16:24.857
In. I'm hungry

16:25.067 --> 16:27.694
Could we come in, too?
Just for some water?

16:28.362 --> 16:29.904
Okay. Take off your shoes

16:29.989 --> 16:32.031
Except you, Kevin
They stay on

16:34.576 --> 16:37.245
Wow, I forgot how
pretty your house is

16:37.705 --> 16:41.457
This is the newest addition,
built by Erasmus Schrute in 1808

16:41.542 --> 16:44.627
It doubled as a tuberculosis
recovery room until 2009.

16:46.922 --> 16:49.132
That's too much doodle
and not enough lab

16:49.216 --> 16:51.968
Yeah, when are they gonna do a
Labradoodle that's just lab?

16:52.052 --> 16:53.928
That's what I'm saying

16:58.350 --> 16:59.434
Hey

17:00.060 --> 17:01.811
You're welcome.
Thanks for the coffee

17:01.895 --> 17:04.480
So, tonight I was thinking,
I'm gonna go to the cemetery

17:04.565 --> 17:05.857
I'm gonna drink
a little wine

17:05.941 --> 17:07.775
and I thought maybe you'd
like to come with me

17:08.527 --> 17:09.986
Are you asking me
on a date?

17:10.529 --> 17:11.904
Yes, I am

17:12.114 --> 17:13.448
Because I don't
date coworkers

17:13.656 --> 17:15.907
it's not personal.
It's a matter of policy

17:16.242 --> 17:17.367
I could quit

17:17.453 --> 17:18.453
Problem solved

17:18.537 --> 17:19.912
Don't quit

17:21.957 --> 17:23.915
Good policy
It's sensible

17:24.001 --> 17:25.167
Smart

17:26.962 --> 17:28.588
All right. Serving

17:28.672 --> 17:30.173
Serving, serving, serving

17:30.424 --> 17:32.383
In the box.
In the box

17:39.641 --> 17:41.768
Why haven't
we heard anything?

17:41.852 --> 17:44.645
It's 4:45 There's
only 15 minutes left

17:44.980 --> 17:46.981
Oh, now you
can do math?

17:47.191 --> 17:48.983
Where were you two hours
ago beautiful mind?

17:49.068 --> 17:50.735
I made a mistake
I'm sorry!

17:50.819 --> 17:52.904
I know how to save
the company, everyone

17:53.322 --> 17:56.407
Just write a petition,
get everyone's signature

17:56.492 --> 18:00.745
including our clients,
march down to Florida

18:00.829 --> 18:02.080
and shove it up your butt

18:04.500 --> 18:05.958
it's not that funny

18:17.513 --> 18:19.013
Pam, you got something
on your shirt.

18:19.807 --> 18:21.599
Oh!

18:21.683 --> 18:25.019
Well, pobody's
nerfect, right?

18:25.354 --> 18:28.147
Did you just have a stroke, Pam?
It's "nobody's perfect.'

18:28.774 --> 18:29.941
Nice stroke, Pam

18:30.025 --> 18:32.235
No, it's a jokey saying

18:32.319 --> 18:33.778
"Pobody's nerfect.'

18:33.862 --> 18:36.030
Like, I can't even
say those words right

18:37.366 --> 18:38.825
I hadn't heard that before

18:39.493 --> 18:40.952
That's funny

18:42.162 --> 18:43.538
Dwight, there's just the small

18:43.622 --> 18:47.041
You know what would go so
great with this cabbage pie?

18:47.334 --> 18:48.292
Milk

18:48.377 --> 18:49.627
Any specific animal?

18:50.045 --> 18:52.463
I'm thinking cow
Don't say cow.

18:54.007 --> 18:56.134
What are you doing?
It's five to 5:00

18:56.218 --> 18:58.803
Just don't talk
about the e-mail, okay?

18:58.887 --> 19:01.347
He's gonna cancel it on his
own I really think he will.

19:01.431 --> 19:03.349
That's insane
Just trust me.

19:03.433 --> 19:05.268
Trust you? Like I trusted
Dwight this morning?

19:05.352 --> 19:06.686
I got this

19:11.900 --> 19:13.359
Thanks for everything

19:13.443 --> 19:14.819
Sive drafely

19:19.032 --> 19:21.659
Wasn't it supposed
to be drive safely?

19:25.747 --> 19:26.956
Is that my phone?

19:28.625 --> 19:29.834
Sounded like mine

19:29.918 --> 19:32.920
No, I think it's mine Let me
just check real quick here

19:33.005 --> 19:34.255
All right

19:34.339 --> 19:37.091
No, it's mine.
You took it out of my bag

19:37.509 --> 19:39.051
Oh. Oops

19:39.136 --> 19:40.970
Yeah
Can I have it?

19:41.096 --> 19:42.138
Yes

19:43.849 --> 19:44.849
Right now?

19:44.933 --> 19:45.933
Yes
There you go

19:46.018 --> 19:47.894
Whoa! No! Wait, wait

19:48.604 --> 19:49.604
What the *?

19:49.688 --> 19:50.688
Oh, man
I'm sorry!

19:50.772 --> 19:52.565
Jesus!
Did it break?

19:53.025 --> 19:54.859
No, it's good, thanks.
You sure?

19:54.943 --> 19:56.110
Yeah

19:56.278 --> 19:57.445
What kind of
iPhone is that?

19:58.947 --> 20:00.656
It's the standard one,
the one everyone has

20:00.741 --> 20:03.117
Yeah. I have the one
that nobody has.

20:03.202 --> 20:05.369
Is there anything
interesting?

20:05.454 --> 20:07.788
It depends, Jim.
Do you find one-day-only

20:07.956 --> 20:10.291
JetBlue sales to
Buffalo interesting?

20:11.960 --> 20:14.795
No, I don't

20:18.759 --> 20:19.967
All right

20:20.719 --> 20:24.555
Well, I am sore and
obviously horrible at this

20:24.640 --> 20:25.932
My serve

20:31.313 --> 20:33.022
Dwight stopped the device

20:33.815 --> 20:34.857
Yes

20:37.569 --> 20:39.070
He stopped it

20:39.905 --> 20:40.905
Yes

20:40.989 --> 20:42.323
We still have our jobs

20:42.699 --> 20:44.408
They're not my favorite
people in the world

20:44.534 --> 20:46.160
I wouldn't even
call them friends.

20:46.245 --> 20:48.663
They come over here,
eat my pie,

20:48.747 --> 20:51.707
dig the crappiest horse grave
you've ever seen.

20:52.000 --> 20:55.544
God, I'm gonna have to work
with them forever, aren't I?

20:57.673 --> 21:00.049
Just take it easy
Nice and easy

21:02.678 --> 21:03.678
Classic, right?

21:14.189 --> 21:15.356
Ooh

21:15.440 --> 21:16.899
I'm all right.
You all right?

21:17.025 --> 21:18.442
Yeah.
Skinned knee

21:18.527 --> 21:19.610
Yeah

21:22.322 --> 21:23.781
Need a little ice
on that, maybe.

21:23.865 --> 21:26.534
Yeah. That does
not feel good.

21:26.660 --> 21:28.244
Okay. My serve
