WEBVTT

00:07.767 --> 00:09.000
- *

00:09.100 --> 00:12.833
- * W-w-w-w-we're going
on a date night *

00:12.933 --> 00:15.467
* A night without our children

00:15.567 --> 00:18.400
- * No kids, no problem,
freedom **

00:20.367 --> 00:22.567
- You guys have to do that
every time you go out?

00:22.667 --> 00:26.700
- Oh, honey, we love you,
but you made us old.

00:26.800 --> 00:28.467
- Dad, why aren't you wearing
your awesome new glasses?

00:28.567 --> 00:30.433
- Oh, Thunderman
does not need glasses.

00:30.533 --> 00:32.467
I have the vision
of a jungle cat.

00:32.567 --> 00:35.867
Ah!

00:35.967 --> 00:39.033
- Lucky for you, there are
no coffee tables in the jungle.

00:39.133 --> 00:40.867
- Hey, thanks
for watching Chloe.

00:40.967 --> 00:42.167
- It'll be so easy.

00:42.267 --> 00:45.000
I mean, she kinda adores me.

00:45.100 --> 00:46.733
Greatest big sis ever.

00:46.833 --> 00:48.167
Oh, I even bought her
new pajamas

00:48.267 --> 00:49.533
with sparkly slippers.

00:49.633 --> 00:50.867
- Oh.
- Ah.

00:50.967 --> 00:52.567
- I look good, baby.

00:54.733 --> 00:55.967
- Mom, Dad!

00:56.067 --> 00:58.700
Billy got salami grease
all over my tablet.

00:58.800 --> 01:02.900
- Actually, you got your tablet
all over my salami grease.

01:03.067 --> 01:04.933
Apologize.

01:05.067 --> 01:07.467
- Billy,
enough with the salami eating.

01:07.567 --> 01:09.467
- But it's full of all kinds
of Italian vitamins,

01:09.567 --> 01:13.400
like these white speaks
and chewy things.

01:13.500 --> 01:15.600
- Just listening to you kids
makes me older.

01:15.700 --> 01:16.633
Off to the movies.

01:16.733 --> 01:18.633
Thunderman, away!

01:25.933 --> 01:26.967
All right, bye, guys.

01:27.067 --> 01:29.600
- All right, have fun, guys.
- Bye.

01:29.700 --> 01:31.700
- All right, Chloe,
who's ready to hear

01:31.800 --> 01:34.333
the story of Robin Hood?

01:34.433 --> 01:37.133
- Max!

01:37.233 --> 01:39.200
- Apparently not you.

01:39.300 --> 01:41.133
- Hello, my little munchkin.

01:41.233 --> 01:43.133
I heard the tooth fairy

01:43.233 --> 01:45.067
brought you a silver dollar
last night.

01:45.133 --> 01:46.800
- Cha-ching!

01:46.900 --> 01:48.233
- Excellent.

01:48.333 --> 01:53.067
Now, watch as I place the money
behind your ear and...

01:53.100 --> 01:56.200
poof, it's gone.

01:57.433 --> 01:59.533
- Well, of course, I can.

01:59.633 --> 02:00.900
I'm just not gonna.

02:02.733 --> 02:04.367
- Hey.

02:04.467 --> 02:06.133
Give Chloe her money back.

02:06.233 --> 02:08.067
- I'm just keeping it safe
for her.

02:08.133 --> 02:09.500
Like her birthday money.

02:13.167 --> 02:16.100
- I love Max.
He's my favorite.

02:18.700 --> 02:21.067
The same Max who just stole
your tooth money?

02:21.100 --> 02:24.067
- He's funny,
and he has great hair.

02:24.167 --> 02:25.600
- I have great hair, too.

02:25.700 --> 02:27.800
Come on, what does he have
that I don't have?

02:27.900 --> 02:32.400
- A bunny, a band, a slide--
- Okay, new plan.

02:32.500 --> 02:37.167
Uh...I have a better story
than Robin Hood.

02:37.267 --> 02:39.067
It's called Phoebe Hood,

02:39.133 --> 02:40.233
and it might
just change the way

02:40.333 --> 02:43.633
you feel about certain people
in this house.

02:43.733 --> 02:47.900
Once upon a time,
in a land far, far away,

02:48.067 --> 02:52.067
there lived a beautiful girl
named Chloe the Cute.

02:52.133 --> 02:54.867
Everyone loved her,
and she loved everyone,

02:54.967 --> 02:56.800
except the evil sheriff.

02:56.900 --> 02:58.467
- Hello, peasants.

02:58.567 --> 03:02.333
It is I, Sheriff Maxingham.

03:10.067 --> 03:11.300
- Oh, yeah.

03:11.400 --> 03:14.333
He's definitely
not anyone's favorite.

03:14.433 --> 03:17.867
And his hair
is not so great either.

03:17.967 --> 03:20.567
- *

03:20.667 --> 03:23.567
* What you see
is not what you get *

03:23.667 --> 03:26.767
* Living our lives
with a secret *

03:26.867 --> 03:30.067
* We fit right in,
bet you'd never guess *

03:30.100 --> 03:33.467
* Because we're living our lives
just like all the rest *

03:33.567 --> 03:36.967
* A picture-perfect family
is what we try to be *

03:37.067 --> 03:40.233
* But closer you might see
the crazy things we do *

03:40.333 --> 03:41.867
* This isn't make-believe

03:41.967 --> 03:43.433
* It's our reality

03:43.533 --> 03:46.400
* Just your average family
trying to be normal *

03:46.500 --> 03:48.167
* And stay out of trouble

03:48.267 --> 03:50.867
* Living a double life *

03:54.933 --> 03:56.167
- Tell me more.

03:56.267 --> 03:57.567
- Hey, if you want to hear
the whole Phoebe Hood story,

03:57.667 --> 03:58.967
you're gonna need a snack.

04:04.633 --> 04:06.100
- Where'd you get
movie theater popcorn?

04:06.200 --> 04:08.100
- From Daddy.

04:10.333 --> 04:11.633
Oh, right.

04:11.733 --> 04:15.233
The mean old Sheriff Maxingham
had just arrived.

04:15.333 --> 04:17.300
Did I mention nobody liked him?

04:17.400 --> 04:19.767
Especially Chloe the Cute.

04:19.867 --> 04:22.800
- Now line up and pay your taxes
for the king,

04:22.900 --> 04:24.900
you deadbeats.

04:25.067 --> 04:29.200
- We barely have enough money
for food, dye-bro-sof.

04:29.300 --> 04:33.933
- I'm sorry, I couldn't hear you
over the sound of your stench.

04:34.067 --> 04:35.533
Now hand over the lute.

04:39.800 --> 04:42.967
And the rest of you,
show me the money!

04:45.567 --> 04:47.067
I said show, not throw.

04:53.267 --> 04:55.067
What about you, little girl?

04:55.100 --> 04:57.200
Do you have anything of value
for the king?

04:57.300 --> 04:58.567
- Nope.

04:58.667 --> 04:59.567
- Hmm.

04:59.667 --> 05:02.200
What about
those golden slippers?

05:02.300 --> 05:03.667
Hand 'em over, Hobbit Child.

05:06.900 --> 05:10.167
- Hey, you won't get
away with this, Sheriff Dude.

05:10.267 --> 05:13.733
Who's gonna stop me?

05:13.833 --> 05:17.933
- *

05:19.500 --> 05:21.167
- I'm going to stop you.

05:22.467 --> 05:25.333
- Phoebe Hood,
protector of the weak and...

05:25.433 --> 05:27.133
other people
who can't afford to shower.

05:29.467 --> 05:31.967
- You may protect
the poor and stinky,

05:32.067 --> 05:33.400
but who's gonna protect you?

05:33.500 --> 05:35.333
- They are.

05:35.433 --> 05:39.733
- *

05:41.667 --> 05:43.900
- These are my merry men.

05:45.767 --> 05:50.733
- I'm sorry.
I mean, my merry crew.

05:50.833 --> 05:52.767
Barb Marian.

05:52.867 --> 05:54.567
Little Hank.

05:54.667 --> 05:58.767
- Your days of stealing
are over, Maxingham.

05:58.867 --> 05:59.867
- He's that way.

06:00.067 --> 06:04.067
You'd know that
if you wore your glasses.

06:04.133 --> 06:05.533
- Don't forget Friar Billy.

06:05.633 --> 06:09.367
- May the salami be with you.

06:09.467 --> 06:10.767
- And finally--

06:13.433 --> 06:15.367
- Uh, sure,
if that's what you want,

06:15.467 --> 06:17.733
then yes, BeyoncÃ©.

06:17.833 --> 06:20.133
- *

06:24.333 --> 06:27.833
- He who felt it dealt it.

06:27.933 --> 06:31.467
- Guys, can we focus on
fighting injustice here, please?

06:34.200 --> 06:36.100
My men are fearless.

06:42.167 --> 06:44.633
That changes things.

06:44.733 --> 06:47.700
- We'll take our belongings now,
if you don't mind.

06:49.700 --> 06:52.100
- You haven't heard
the end of this, Phoebe Hood.

06:55.933 --> 07:01.367
- ALL: Phoebe Hood! Phoebe Hood!
Phoebe Hood!

07:01.467 --> 07:03.100
- You're my favorite,
Phoebe Hood.

07:04.933 --> 07:07.600
She should be your favorite,
too, Tiny Dude.

07:09.200 --> 07:11.400
- PHOEBE: And so Phoebe Hood
and her merry crew

07:11.500 --> 07:14.067
started giving everyone back
their stuff.

07:14.133 --> 07:19.633
But Chloe the Cute's slippers
were nowhere to be found.

07:19.733 --> 07:21.833
- What happened
to the slippers?

07:21.933 --> 07:24.667
- They were stolen
by that jerk Max.

07:24.767 --> 07:27.267
Phff, did I say Max?

07:27.367 --> 07:29.567
I meant Maxingham.

07:29.667 --> 07:32.767
Funny, they almost
sound the same, don't they?

07:32.867 --> 07:35.100
- Anyway, back at the castle,
Sheriff Maxingham

07:35.200 --> 07:39.433
trembled in fear before
his mighty, all-powerful king.

07:39.533 --> 07:41.967
- Fear me!

07:42.067 --> 07:46.633
You dare to return
to King Colosso with no money?

07:46.733 --> 07:50.600
Have you seen
the royal treasury?

07:50.700 --> 07:52.900
We are this close
to being common folk.

07:53.067 --> 07:55.767
I can't even afford
a decent jester.

07:55.867 --> 07:58.400
- What do you call a pony
with a sore throat?

07:58.500 --> 08:00.933
A little horse.

08:03.300 --> 08:04.967
- Uhhhh.

08:05.067 --> 08:07.333
You've got to get rid
of Phoebe Hood.

08:08.500 --> 08:09.600
I don't know how to find her.

08:09.700 --> 08:11.067
- Well, if you don't,

08:11.167 --> 08:14.067
I'll tell everyone
you wear a wig.

08:14.100 --> 08:18.233
- That was a secret
between friends.

08:18.333 --> 08:20.767
Wait! I have an idea.

08:20.867 --> 08:24.233
If we can't find her,
maybe we can lure her to us

08:24.333 --> 08:26.733
by hosting an archery contest.

08:26.833 --> 08:28.067
- She'll never show.

08:28.167 --> 08:31.500
- She will, if these are
the grand prize.

08:34.200 --> 08:36.133
- When Phoebe Hood
shows up for these,

08:36.233 --> 08:38.567
we'll be waiting for her.

08:38.667 --> 08:40.667
- Why did the king
go to the dentist?

08:40.767 --> 08:42.967
To get his teeth crowned!

08:45.867 --> 08:49.067
- And they accuse me of torture.

08:49.167 --> 08:50.933
- *

08:51.067 --> 08:53.600
- PHOEBE: So, the king
threw a contest,

08:53.700 --> 08:56.967
and invited the best archers
from across the land.

08:59.300 --> 09:04.567
- *

09:04.667 --> 09:06.767
- I promise I will
win back your slippers.

09:06.867 --> 09:08.933
- You're my hero, Phoebe Hood.

09:10.800 --> 09:13.567
- Bad-da-da-ba-ba-ba!

09:13.667 --> 09:16.133
Make way for the king!

09:17.733 --> 09:20.800
- Boooo!

09:20.900 --> 09:22.600
- Oh, look how
they love their king,

09:22.700 --> 09:24.767
calling me their boos.

09:24.867 --> 09:26.767
Back at ya, boos!

09:28.433 --> 09:30.467
- You ready to catch
Phoebe Hood, Your Highness?

09:30.567 --> 09:35.467
- This better work, Maxingham,
or I'll put you on poop patrol.

09:35.567 --> 09:37.700
- And you people
wonder why I stink.

09:43.933 --> 09:47.200
Let the royal contest begin!

09:47.300 --> 09:51.900
Our first contestant,
Sheriff Maxingham.

09:52.067 --> 09:54.833
- Watch and learn, people.

09:57.367 --> 10:01.000
- *

10:04.333 --> 10:06.200
- Boo-yah!

10:06.300 --> 10:08.900
That's how you do it.

10:09.000 --> 10:11.800
I guess those golden slippers
are all mine.

10:11.900 --> 10:16.967
Unless, someone here
can beat me.

10:17.067 --> 10:18.533
- I'd like to give it a shoot.

10:20.267 --> 10:21.433
All right, fine.

10:21.533 --> 10:22.800
But hurry up,

10:22.900 --> 10:25.333
I'm in the middle of
a genius plan to find someone.

10:25.433 --> 10:26.833
Ssh.

10:31.767 --> 10:33.900
- I'm so glad you're done
with that greasy thing.

10:34.000 --> 10:34.767
Me, too.

10:34.867 --> 10:36.900
Now I can start on this bad boy!

10:40.500 --> 10:42.767
- *

10:44.667 --> 10:46.033
- Hooray!

10:46.133 --> 10:49.167
- She split
the sheriff's arrow in two!

10:51.967 --> 10:55.500
- Talk about
a split personality.

10:57.933 --> 11:02.333
- Ugh, where's the black plague
when you need it?

11:04.733 --> 11:07.133
- You broke my favorite arrow.

11:07.233 --> 11:09.367
Only one person in the kingdom
could do that.

11:12.267 --> 11:13.533
Phoebe Hood.

11:13.633 --> 11:15.733
I knew you wouldn't be able
to resist those slippers.

11:15.833 --> 11:17.333
Guards, arrest her!

11:17.433 --> 11:18.700
- *

11:18.800 --> 11:19.733
- I guess we're doing this
the hard way.

11:23.100 --> 11:26.400
- *

11:34.433 --> 11:37.767
- *

11:42.700 --> 11:44.067
- Don't worry, Phoebe Hood,

11:44.100 --> 11:47.333
I'll take out those guards
with my incredible aim.

11:47.433 --> 11:48.600
- Oh!

11:50.167 --> 11:52.233
Why isn't everyone
cheering for me?

11:52.333 --> 11:54.933
- Because you just captured
Phoebe Hood.

11:55.067 --> 11:57.333
- Ooh, I thought
she was over there.

11:57.433 --> 12:00.767
- That's Stonehenge.

12:00.867 --> 12:02.567
- Friar Billy,
fetch the weapons cart.

12:08.067 --> 12:11.100
- Oops, I guess I grabbed
the wrong cart.

12:11.200 --> 12:13.200
No one eat the soup tonight.

12:16.933 --> 12:19.433
- Maxingham, your plan worked.

12:19.533 --> 12:24.400
Don't worry, Phoebe Hood,
I'll give you a fair trial.

12:24.500 --> 12:26.233
- Guilty!

12:26.333 --> 12:29.333
I sentence you to be flung
from the kingdom by catapult!

12:30.967 --> 12:34.133
- Your tax dollars at work,
people.

12:34.233 --> 12:36.633
- *

12:36.733 --> 12:38.467
- Phoebe Hood!

12:46.833 --> 12:49.433
- Not Phoebe Hood,
she's my favorite.

12:49.533 --> 12:50.433
- Yep.

12:50.533 --> 12:52.600
Oh, you wanna know a secret?

12:52.700 --> 12:56.300
Phoebe Hood is really me.

12:56.400 --> 12:57.900
I guess that makes me
your favorite.

13:00.500 --> 13:01.700
- Yep.

13:01.800 --> 13:05.900
I guess that makes him
not your favorite.

13:07.867 --> 13:09.533
- You're a naughty sheriff.

13:16.300 --> 13:18.767
- I left him at the North Pole.

13:20.433 --> 13:23.567
- Your story, silly.

13:23.667 --> 13:25.067
- Oh.

13:25.167 --> 13:26.333
- *

13:29.133 --> 13:31.133
- Chloe, you need to bring
Max back from the North Pole.

13:31.233 --> 13:33.333
- Nope.

13:33.433 --> 13:36.567
Come on,
he's your favorite, remember?

13:36.667 --> 13:38.567
- No, you're my favorite.

13:38.667 --> 13:39.733
- So hard to enjoy that

13:39.833 --> 13:42.533
while Max is getting eaten
by a polar bear.

13:42.633 --> 13:44.100
- We're home!

13:44.200 --> 13:46.367
- Date night
is officially over.

13:47.667 --> 13:48.800
I mean, you guys were barely
even gone an hour.

13:48.900 --> 13:50.400
What kind of date night is that?

13:50.500 --> 13:52.067
- Uh, your father
couldn't see the screen,

13:52.167 --> 13:54.700
because he forgot his glasses.

13:54.800 --> 13:57.300
- Well, also,
someone stole my popcorn.

14:00.067 --> 14:01.433
I bet Max had something
to do with it.

14:01.533 --> 14:02.600
Max!

14:02.700 --> 14:04.800
- Wait, no, Dad, um...
Max went to bed early.

14:04.900 --> 14:06.867
I think he's coming down
with a cold.

14:06.967 --> 14:08.200
- Oh, he's cold.

14:13.467 --> 14:16.533
Why don't you guys go
and get some ice cream, huh?

14:16.633 --> 14:17.767
My treat.

14:17.867 --> 14:19.333
Can't let your date night
end like this.

14:19.433 --> 14:21.700
* You're going back out
on your date night *

14:21.800 --> 14:23.500
* A night
without your children *

14:23.600 --> 14:24.733
* No kids, no problems

14:24.833 --> 14:27.067
- BOTH: * Freedom *

14:29.867 --> 14:32.767
- Okay, Chloe, listen.

14:32.867 --> 14:34.500
I know I may have told you
a story

14:34.600 --> 14:35.733
that made Max seem evil.

14:35.833 --> 14:37.433
But you're gonna
wanna bring him back

14:37.533 --> 14:40.233
when you hear
the end of the story.

14:40.333 --> 14:44.233
Back at the kingdom,
Phoebe Hood was held prisoner.

14:44.333 --> 14:46.600
But to everyone's surprise,
Maxingham had a change a heart.

14:46.700 --> 14:48.300
- I've had a change of heart.

14:51.733 --> 14:53.667
- Hooray for Maxingham!

14:53.767 --> 14:56.733
- CROWD: Hooray!

14:56.833 --> 14:58.700
- BOTH: The end.

14:58.800 --> 14:59.833
- *

15:00.067 --> 15:01.767
- Booooo!

15:01.867 --> 15:02.800
I'm going to bed.

15:02.900 --> 15:04.167
- Wait, no, no, no.

15:04.267 --> 15:07.700
My bad, I, uh--I told you
the wrong ending.

15:07.800 --> 15:11.067
Uh, this is how it really goes.

15:11.100 --> 15:12.800
Phoebe Hood
was about to be catapulted

15:12.900 --> 15:15.067
out of the kingdom forever.

15:15.100 --> 15:16.200
- Goodbye!

15:16.300 --> 15:17.967
I shall miss you all.

15:18.067 --> 15:20.500
Even you, Poop Patrol.

15:20.600 --> 15:24.533
- She knows my name.

15:24.633 --> 15:26.900
- Please don't get rid
of Phoebe Hood.

15:27.067 --> 15:28.267
- Sorry, kid.

15:28.367 --> 15:31.867
Can't be this good-looking
and nice at the same time.

15:31.967 --> 15:33.633
- Yes, you can.

15:39.833 --> 15:42.067
- PHOEBE: Meanwhile,
the merry crew was desperate

15:42.167 --> 15:44.800
to find a way to save
Phoebe Hood and themselves.

15:44.900 --> 15:46.400
- We have to save Phoebe Hood.

15:46.500 --> 15:48.533
- And ourselves.

15:48.633 --> 15:49.633
- The worst part is,

15:49.733 --> 15:51.400
I can't get this wedgie
out of my moat.

15:54.300 --> 15:56.500
- Let the flinging begin!

16:02.833 --> 16:04.133
- Release her!

16:04.233 --> 16:05.500
- That's what I said.

16:05.600 --> 16:10.267
Release the thing
and make her fling.

16:10.367 --> 16:13.233
- Don't...even think about it.

16:16.100 --> 16:18.833
- Maxingham,
what are you doing?

16:18.933 --> 16:20.200
- Fighting for justice

16:20.300 --> 16:22.233
and slipper-less children
everywhere.

16:27.967 --> 16:30.200
It takes a lot of courage
to do the right thing.

16:30.300 --> 16:32.400
- Friar Billy,
your greasy salami hands

16:32.500 --> 16:34.833
let you slide
right out of your shackles.

16:34.933 --> 16:36.400
- Whoo, that was close.

16:36.500 --> 16:39.900
I wouldn't want
to get in any more trouble.

16:40.067 --> 16:42.367
- No, get out of there
and free us all.

16:42.467 --> 16:43.867
- Oooh.

16:43.967 --> 16:47.300
- And help me with this wedgie.

16:47.400 --> 16:50.333
- Are you going soft on me,
Maxingham?

16:50.433 --> 16:52.967
Last time I checked,
this was the medieval times.

16:53.067 --> 16:55.433
Not the mid-nice guy times.

16:57.500 --> 16:59.233
- Clever.

16:59.333 --> 17:01.867
- Guards! Get him!

17:01.967 --> 17:05.767
- *

17:16.333 --> 17:18.433
- Maxingham,
you're good after all

17:18.533 --> 17:20.833
and should never be stranded
in the North Pole.

17:22.167 --> 17:24.767
- Nothing.
Just hand me a sword.

17:24.867 --> 17:26.067
Really?

17:26.133 --> 17:27.200
- Ah!

17:30.700 --> 17:34.933
- *

17:41.200 --> 17:45.500
- *

18:10.767 --> 18:12.100
- We're free!

18:12.200 --> 18:15.133
- *

18:15.233 --> 18:17.133
- Merry crew, snap the whip!

18:17.233 --> 18:18.267
- I can't see where I'm going.

18:18.367 --> 18:19.667
- Put on your glasses!

18:19.767 --> 18:21.567
- All right.

18:25.933 --> 18:28.833
Uh, that felt good!

18:28.933 --> 18:30.833
Oh, everything is so clear.

18:32.533 --> 18:34.733
- Get up, you buffoons!

18:34.833 --> 18:37.367
- Wait, our king
is a talking rabbit?

18:37.467 --> 18:39.833
Does everyone know this?

18:39.933 --> 18:42.700
- *

19:00.733 --> 19:01.967
- Yeah!

19:02.067 --> 19:05.100
Phoebe Hood is safe!

19:05.200 --> 19:07.300
So is anyone buying this?

19:07.400 --> 19:10.667
- Don't worry,
we'll give you a fair trial.

19:10.767 --> 19:12.300
- Oh, argh!

19:13.633 --> 19:14.300
- Guilty!

19:14.400 --> 19:17.633
- You wouldn't dare.

19:17.733 --> 19:19.800
Wah!

19:19.900 --> 19:23.433
You d-d-d-did!

19:28.933 --> 19:32.233
- If I'm not mistaken,
these belong to you.

19:32.333 --> 19:34.500
- My golden slippers.

19:34.600 --> 19:37.967
- From now on, I'd like to steal
for good instead of evil.

19:38.067 --> 19:40.100
That is if you'll have me.

19:41.400 --> 19:44.767
Should we let Maxingham
join our merry crew?

19:44.867 --> 19:46.067
- Yes!

19:49.867 --> 19:52.067
- This is so "sweeches."

19:53.467 --> 19:55.300
These tears count as a shower.

19:58.767 --> 20:02.900
- I dub thee
Sir Good Hair of the Merry Men.

20:03.000 --> 20:04.100
- Merry crew!

20:04.200 --> 20:06.200
Why don't you people get this?

20:06.300 --> 20:10.667
- ALL: Huzzah! Huzzah! Huzzah!

20:10.767 --> 20:12.367
- I don't suppose
you need a funny jester

20:12.467 --> 20:14.600
to lighten things up
every now and then?

20:23.700 --> 20:25.833
- *

20:25.933 --> 20:28.467
- So Maxingham
was now part of the merry crew,

20:28.567 --> 20:29.767
and became Chloe the Cute's

20:29.867 --> 20:32.633
favorite person
in the entire kingdom.

20:32.733 --> 20:34.333
The end.

20:36.333 --> 20:37.767
- Yeah.

20:37.867 --> 20:40.000
You only thought he was bad
because his jealous twin sister

20:40.100 --> 20:42.800
reworked a classic
to win you over.

20:42.900 --> 20:45.233
- I like Phoebe Hood
and Maxingham.

20:45.333 --> 20:46.933
They're both my favorite.

20:47.033 --> 20:47.967
- Okay, good.

20:48.067 --> 20:49.700
So, can we please
bring Max back now?

20:55.067 --> 20:59.800
B-b-b-b-rain f-f-f-freeze.

21:02.067 --> 21:05.300
Thanks for bringing me back
from the North Pole, Chloe.

21:05.400 --> 21:08.067
Why'd you take me
to the North Pole, Chloe?

21:08.133 --> 21:11.133
I mean,
why do kids anything, right?

21:11.233 --> 21:13.400
So weird.

21:13.500 --> 21:14.467
- We're home.

21:14.567 --> 21:16.700
- And we brought ice cream.

21:17.667 --> 21:18.867
You think that's funny?

21:24.067 --> 21:26.667
- Uh, why do kids
do anything, right?

21:26.767 --> 21:28.767
So weird.

21:28.867 --> 21:30.367
Oh, hey,
your new glasses look good.

21:30.467 --> 21:31.467
- Well, yeah.

21:31.567 --> 21:33.333
I decided
just because I need glasses

21:33.433 --> 21:37.467
doesn't mean
I'm not heroic or handsome.

21:37.567 --> 21:39.500
- He couldn't read
the ice cream menu.

21:41.700 --> 21:43.633
- Why is there grease
on the remote?

21:43.733 --> 21:44.900
Billy!

21:46.967 --> 21:48.467
- Sorry, it wasn't Billy.

21:48.567 --> 21:49.567
What can I say?

21:49.667 --> 21:52.533
The kid knows his salami.

21:52.633 --> 21:54.567
- It's great in smoothies, too.

21:57.233 --> 21:58.233
Nope, it's not.

21:58.333 --> 22:00.967
I'm gonna go puke.

22:01.067 --> 22:02.067
- I love Billy.

22:02.133 --> 22:05.267
He's my favorite.

22:05.367 --> 22:07.800
- *

22:11.867 --> 22:16.767
- *
