you should be asking me

You have made it
abundantly clear

08:55.201 --> 08:57.537
I was, um...

08:57.537 --> 08:59.205
uh, his parking meter
had expired.

08:59.205 --> 09:01.374
So I put a quarter in it,
because that's what

09:01.374 --> 09:03.143
a good person does.
Or is that

09:03.143 --> 09:05.378
what stalkers do?
A stalker?

09:05.378 --> 09:06.546
(laughing):
Me?

09:06.546 --> 09:09.149
You called
his office

09:09.149 --> 09:12.152
every day for
three weeks.

09:12.152 --> 09:14.788
(taps table)
Nine times... yesterday.

09:14.788 --> 09:17.657
I never thought of you as the
car bomb type, but pestering

09:17.657 --> 09:19.826
his office, staking out his
car‐‐ it's not a good look.

09:19.826 --> 09:20.794
Even for you, Leo.

09:20.794 --> 09:23.163
Okay, look,
business has been down lately,

09:23.163 --> 09:25.165
so I was out...
selling my talents.

09:25.165 --> 09:26.699
I thought maybe that Gene
could help me,

09:26.699 --> 09:27.834
because we used to work together

09:27.834 --> 09:29.736
before I got fired
from the DA's.

09:29.736 --> 09:32.572
Is that why you happened to bump
into him at the restaurant?

09:32.572 --> 09:33.873
Yes. That's all I could get.

09:33.873 --> 09:35.842
In fact, it took me a month
of romancing

09:35.842 --> 09:37.444
his senior assistant
just to get <i>that</i> meeting.

09:37.444 --> 09:38.611
"Romancing"?

09:38.611 --> 09:39.879
Yeah. If
you got it,

09:39.879 --> 09:41.181
use it.

09:41.181 --> 09:42.449
Look, it didn't
even matter.

09:42.449 --> 09:43.483
Gene canceled
the meeting anyway,

09:43.483 --> 09:45.585
'cause he said he had
to head out to Helendale.

09:45.585 --> 09:47.520
Helendale Prison?
Why? For a case?

09:47.520 --> 09:48.721
That I cannot say.

09:48.721 --> 09:50.056
Because you don't know?

09:50.890 --> 09:53.193
Because I do not know.

09:53.193 --> 09:55.428
But I will take that Fresca
when you get a chance.

09:55.428 --> 09:57.197
Thanks for wasting our time.

09:57.197 --> 09:59.866
He is really abrasive today.

09:59.866 --> 10:01.668
You <i>were</i> on top of his wife.

10:01.668 --> 10:03.536
It was a protective maneuver!
(door closes)

10:03.536 --> 10:04.737
(elevator bell dings)

10:04.737 --> 10:06.739
(whistling tune)

10:07.740 --> 10:09.742
Hey, Murtaugh.

10:09.742 --> 10:12.779
Got a sec? I found out
the inmate that Gene

10:12.779 --> 10:14.447
was gonna see at Helendale.

10:14.447 --> 10:15.882
It's Riggs' father‐in‐law.

10:15.882 --> 10:18.551
Ronnie Delgado?

10:18.551 --> 10:20.887
That was smart, keeping it
close to the vest.

10:20.887 --> 10:23.790
BAILEY: Yeah, I thought
we would check in with Avery...
MURTAUGH: No.

10:23.790 --> 10:25.258
No.

10:25.258 --> 10:27.827
Let me handle this.

10:29.762 --> 10:30.797
What is that?

10:30.797 --> 10:32.565
What the hell are you doing?

10:34.467 --> 10:35.835
(sighs heavily)

10:35.835 --> 10:38.738
Gene was supposed to visit
Ronnie Delgado

10:38.738 --> 10:40.807
at Helendale today‐‐
Bailey's gonna go

10:40.807 --> 10:42.142
check it out for us.

10:42.876 --> 10:44.577
Not a chance.

10:44.577 --> 10:47.714
Look, if Ronnie's involved, that
means our cartel angle's good.

10:47.714 --> 10:49.649
Right? We have a lot
of catching up to do.

10:50.650 --> 10:52.519
Martin Riggs!

10:53.686 --> 10:56.122
That was not a request.

10:58.658 --> 11:00.460
(laughs)

11:00.460 --> 11:02.428
That's...
I'll see you in the car.

11:02.428 --> 11:03.429
Why's he laughing?

11:06.533 --> 11:09.669
♪ Okay, okay,
sorry I'm runnin' late ♪

11:09.669 --> 11:13.139
♪ I did not come here to play,
I got money to make ♪

11:13.139 --> 11:14.474
♪ Cruisin' the streets ♪

11:14.474 --> 11:16.209

11:20.547 --> 11:21.848
(lock buzzes, latch clicks)

11:21.848 --> 11:25.451
MURTAUGH: <i>When I make a call</i>
<i>like that, I am speaking</i>

11:25.451 --> 11:26.886
as a senior detective.

11:26.886 --> 11:31.891
And I want you to see me
as an authority, not a friend.

11:31.891 --> 11:33.893
RIGGS: If it's any
consolation, Rog,

11:33.893 --> 11:35.461
I wouldn't listen
to you as either.

11:35.461 --> 11:36.829
INMATE:
Hey, Murtaugh.

11:36.829 --> 11:38.631
You remember me?

11:38.631 --> 11:40.567
Oh. Friend of yours?

11:40.567 --> 11:43.236
Definitely not
in the friend category.

11:56.916 --> 11:58.284
INMATE:
What's up, man?

11:58.284 --> 12:00.186
Man, get your hands off me.
Hey, punk.

12:00.186 --> 12:02.188
(inmates shouting)

12:02.188 --> 12:04.591
(alarm blaring, whistle blowing)
GUARD (over P. A.):
Emergency response,

12:04.591 --> 12:05.892
report to the yard.
Code one.

12:05.892 --> 12:07.594
Repeat. Emergency response...

12:07.594 --> 12:09.729
We need backup
on the yard now!

12:09.729 --> 12:11.464
Code one.

12:11.464 --> 12:12.799
Back up, back up!

12:12.799 --> 12:16.102
(distorted shouting)

12:21.541 --> 12:24.677
Code one riot.
Code one riot.

12:24.677 --> 12:26.212
Need some help down here.

12:26.212 --> 12:27.213
(groans)

12:27.213 --> 12:28.648
(dog barking)

12:28.648 --> 12:30.817
Back up!
Move! Back up!

12:34.554 --> 12:35.755
Hey, hey!

12:35.755 --> 12:38.458
(grunting)

12:40.760 --> 12:42.762
(gunshot)

12:42.762 --> 12:44.464
All inmates on the ground.

12:44.464 --> 12:45.865
(whistle blowing)

12:45.865 --> 12:47.200
You will be shot.
All inmates...

12:47.200 --> 12:49.569
All right.
Let me see, let me see.

12:50.903 --> 12:53.473
You should've let him kill me.

12:53.473 --> 12:55.108
You're not getting off
that easy, Ronnie.

13:16.863 --> 13:18.598
Martin.

13:18.598 --> 13:21.501
I'm glad you came.

13:21.501 --> 13:24.537
No one's visited me since...

13:24.537 --> 13:25.638
That's what happens
when people find out

13:25.638 --> 13:26.606
you work for the cartel.

13:26.606 --> 13:29.809
They don't want to be
around you anymore.

13:31.844 --> 13:33.746
Is that who tried
to kill you out there?

13:33.746 --> 13:36.582
Don't know.

13:36.582 --> 13:37.750
It was all so fast.

13:37.750 --> 13:40.320
(laughing):
Come on, Ronnie.

13:40.320 --> 13:42.755
The guy who shivved you
is covered in cartel tats.

13:42.755 --> 13:43.723
Now, he's not talking,

13:43.723 --> 13:44.924
but I'm guessing he
works for the same fella

13:44.924 --> 13:46.159
that had Gene killed.

13:46.159 --> 13:47.160
Gene?

13:47.160 --> 13:48.261
Nakahara?

13:48.261 --> 13:49.295
Mm‐hmm.

13:49.295 --> 13:51.230
(sighs)
And I understand

13:51.230 --> 13:53.166
he was supposed
to come visit you,

13:53.166 --> 13:54.867
but, see, then his car blew up.

13:54.867 --> 13:57.637
(sighs)

13:57.637 --> 14:01.140
Gene called...
but it wasn't about the cartel.

14:01.140 --> 14:05.812
He‐he‐he wanted
to talk about the past.

14:05.812 --> 14:09.615
Something to do
with the Ojai house.

14:09.615 --> 14:11.584
The Ojai house?

14:11.584 --> 14:12.819
Where we had the wedding?

14:14.821 --> 14:17.890
I'm sorry, Martin...

14:17.890 --> 14:19.726
for everything I've done
to our family.

14:19.726 --> 14:22.228
I'm not your family, Ronnie.

14:22.228 --> 14:24.564
And I wouldn't be here if
it wasn't for the case.

14:24.564 --> 14:26.599
I know you hate me.

14:26.599 --> 14:28.167
You have the right.

14:28.167 --> 14:29.335
But I want you to know

14:29.335 --> 14:31.838
I still think of you as a son.

14:31.838 --> 14:33.873
You shouldn't do that.

14:33.873 --> 14:35.508
Miranda's gone.

14:35.508 --> 14:36.876
Your mother, too.

14:36.876 --> 14:39.245
And your father...

14:39.245 --> 14:41.748
Yeah.

14:41.748 --> 14:43.616
Whatever happened
was bad enough

14:43.616 --> 14:44.851
you never wanted
to talk about it.

14:44.851 --> 14:50.223
And the fact
he's behind bars now...

14:50.223 --> 14:52.225
only makes it worse.

14:53.760 --> 14:55.628
How the hell do you know
about that?

14:55.628 --> 14:59.232
Martin.

14:59.232 --> 15:01.467
It's not your fault.

15:01.467 --> 15:02.568
Did Miranda know?

15:02.568 --> 15:03.569
She was worried.

15:03.569 --> 15:05.204
Answer the question, Ronnie.

15:05.204 --> 15:06.305
Did she know?

15:06.305 --> 15:09.147
I just want to help you.

15:10.716 --> 15:13.719
Well, maybe you shouldn't
have had your daughter killed.

15:14.786 --> 15:17.656
(siren wailing in distance)

15:17.656 --> 15:19.191
(bagpipes playing)

15:19.191 --> 15:20.659
Let me know if I can help...

15:20.659 --> 15:22.661
LEO: Thank you for coming
during this terrible time,

15:22.661 --> 15:25.197
and, you know what, you know
what, please take a card.
I'd say the best one

15:25.197 --> 15:28.066
is the fax number, actually,
the fax is the best.

15:28.066 --> 15:29.434
Hey.
(laughs)

15:29.434 --> 15:30.635
Trish, Rog.

15:30.635 --> 15:32.671
What a delight.

15:32.671 --> 15:35.207
Are you using
a funeral to network?

15:35.207 --> 15:37.609
Everybody grieves
in their own way.

15:37.609 --> 15:40.011
AVERY:
Murtaugh, some gentlemen
I want you to meet.

15:41.146 --> 15:43.548
I guess Leo's not the only one.

15:43.548 --> 15:44.816
Baby, I'll be right back.

15:44.816 --> 15:47.552
And, hey, no
protective maneuvers.

15:49.121 --> 15:50.655
(Avery speaking indistinctly)

15:50.655 --> 15:52.624
Gentlemen, this is, uh,
Detective Murtaugh.

15:52.624 --> 15:54.259
You remember the chief
and the commander.
Hello.

15:54.259 --> 15:56.294
And this is Councilman...
Delighted.

15:56.294 --> 15:58.830
Sean O'Brien.
Hello.
Captain Avery

15:58.830 --> 16:01.099
tells us you've taken lead
on this investigation.

16:01.099 --> 16:03.101
Yes, yes, I have.

16:03.101 --> 16:04.803
Uh, we're pursuing a cartel
angle, which I believe will...

16:04.803 --> 16:06.638
CHIEF:
Why?
(phone ringing)

16:06.638 --> 16:09.508
(indistinct chatter)

16:12.411 --> 16:13.445
Roger.
MURTAUGH:
Yes.

16:13.445 --> 16:14.446
BOTH:
Roger.
And that's why

16:14.446 --> 16:15.514
we're going to pursue

16:15.514 --> 16:17.516
every angle...
Roger.

16:17.516 --> 16:19.684
(Leo whistles)
...uh, possible.

16:19.684 --> 16:21.653
Excuse me.

16:23.522 --> 16:26.158
Hey, what's with the
interpretive dance?

16:26.158 --> 16:27.392
Honey, this‐this guy

16:27.392 --> 16:29.795
was at the restaurant yesterday.
He drove off in a Town Car.

16:29.795 --> 16:30.796
Just like he's
doing right now.

16:30.796 --> 16:31.763
Hold on, hold on.

16:31.763 --> 16:33.665
Oh, I got his license.
What are you doing?

16:33.665 --> 16:34.533
Oh, okay.

16:34.533 --> 16:36.067
All right, I'm gonna go
run the plates.

16:36.067 --> 16:37.436
Yeah. Remember,
he goes to the top

16:37.436 --> 16:38.670
of the suspects list, hmm?

16:38.670 --> 16:40.839
Look, Leo, you got
to let me do my job.

16:40.839 --> 16:42.541
I got a lot of eyes on me
right now, okay?

16:50.449 --> 16:52.150
Trish, you know I
love your husband.
Yeah.

16:52.150 --> 16:56.488
But he is not the
sharpest bulb in the shed.

16:56.488 --> 16:57.823
Look, but with our help...

16:57.823 --> 16:59.191
No. No.

16:59.191 --> 17:00.559
With our help...
No, Leo.

17:00.559 --> 17:01.426
Roger just asked us

17:01.426 --> 17:03.428
not to interfere
with the case, so no.

17:03.428 --> 17:05.030
Oh, so‐so what are we gonna do?
We're gonna wait

17:05.030 --> 17:06.431
for the police to solve it

17:06.431 --> 17:08.633
when they have
some free time?
Leo, lis‐‐ no.

17:08.633 --> 17:10.635
I understand what you're saying,
but no.

17:10.635 --> 17:12.637
Isn't this why we
went to law school?

17:12.637 --> 17:15.106
Isn't this why
we took the bar,

17:15.106 --> 17:17.542
then took the bar again,

17:17.542 --> 17:20.445
so we‐‐ that we
could be warriors

17:20.445 --> 17:24.516
of justice, so that we could
fight for the little guy?

17:24.516 --> 17:26.718
But I can see in your eyes
you want to dig into this.

17:26.718 --> 17:28.453
You want to get
your hands dirty.

17:28.453 --> 17:30.655
Hmm? Don't ya? Don't ya?

17:30.655 --> 17:32.657
Okay, Leo.

17:34.826 --> 17:36.161
For Gene.

17:37.162 --> 17:39.197
Justice for Gene.

17:41.266 --> 17:43.468
This man

17:43.468 --> 17:44.603
visited Helendale Prison

17:44.603 --> 17:46.137
a day before
the Delgado attack.

17:46.137 --> 17:47.472
We know his name,

17:47.472 --> 17:51.476
but the bigger question is:

17:51.476 --> 17:55.747
who is Mike Serrano?

17:55.747 --> 17:57.782
He's a fixer.
He beat a murder rap
a few years ago.

17:57.782 --> 17:59.584
Bailey, don't skip ahead.

17:59.584 --> 18:01.419
AVERY:
Yeah, I've heard
about Serrano.

18:01.419 --> 18:03.421
He cleans up messes
for City Hall types.

18:03.421 --> 18:05.123
Powerful people who
can pull strings.

18:05.123 --> 18:06.157
We're gonna want to tread
lightly with him.

18:06.157 --> 18:07.425
MURTAUGH:
I agree, Captain.

18:07.425 --> 18:09.461
And that's why,
if you look at page four,

18:09.461 --> 18:12.764
you will see our
detailed plan of attack.

18:12.764 --> 18:15.667
Bailey, what are you doing?
I'm in the middle

18:15.667 --> 18:17.502
of a presentation.
Murtaugh, look,
I'm sorry.

18:17.502 --> 18:20.438
I barely had any time to put

25:54.729 --> 25:57.298

Well, a month after she
showed up at the DA's office,

25:59.834 --> 26:01.269
I was given my walking papers.

26:01.269 --> 26:02.637
I always assumed
it was because

26:02.637 --> 26:04.772
she was having an affair
with our golden boy, O'Brien.

26:04.772 --> 26:06.641
Might not have been
the only one, too.

26:06.641 --> 26:08.643

26:12.647 --> 26:14.249
Leo, this isn't a case file.

26:14.249 --> 26:15.783

26:15.783 --> 26:18.653
Gene was digging up
dirt on O'Brien.

this Monica Jones is now?
No.

26:24.792 --> 26:26.928

26:26.928 --> 26:30.265

about the affair,

26:30.265 --> 26:32.800
and O'Brien tried
to silence him?

26:32.800 --> 26:35.737
Yeah, except I don't think it's
enough to get Gene murdered.

26:35.737 --> 26:36.905
Maybe.

26:36.905 --> 26:39.674
Only one way to find out.

26:39.674 --> 26:41.376
We get Roger to bring him in.

26:41.376 --> 26:43.878

a little time

26:43.878 --> 26:47.282

to O'Brien's campaign office

26:47.282 --> 26:49.284

No.

this, a joke?

40:12.820 --> 40:13.921
Well, I...
Am I funny?

40:13.921 --> 40:15.589
Am I funny to you?
I make you laugh?

40:15.589 --> 40:16.690
I'm like a clown? Huh?

40:16.690 --> 40:17.825
No. You know what this is?

40:17.825 --> 40:18.959
This is an insult.

40:18.959 --> 40:21.729
Come back to me
with a real offer,

40:32.740 --> 40:33.807
they can nickel‐and‐dime you.

40:33.807 --> 40:35.642
Know what I'm saying?
(chuckles)

40:35.642 --> 40:37.945
Anyway, where were we?

40:39.980 --> 40:42.549
It's funny.

40:42.549 --> 40:45.719
All this time, she was keeping
her own secrets, you know?

40:46.854 --> 40:49.757
So is she off her pedestal?

40:49.757 --> 40:51.558
No.

40:51.558 --> 40:54.261
She knew everything about me‐‐
she still loved me.

40:54.261 --> 40:56.196
Tough to beat that.

41:01.301 --> 41:03.170
What is it?

41:05.773 --> 41:08.142
I just wish I'd have told her.

41:09.309 --> 41:12.312
How would it change things
if she already knew?

41:13.614 --> 41:15.716
Would've given her a chance
to forgive me.

41:15.716 --> 41:18.185
Sounds like she already did,
Riggs.

41:19.820 --> 41:22.823
Maybe now you can work
on forgiving yourself.
