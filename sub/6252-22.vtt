is this Booth?
[Click, Beep]

36:04.621 --> 36:06.361
Are you in danger?
[Click, Beep]

36:06.457 --> 36:08.288
- Are you after Broadsky?
- [ Click, Beep]

36:08.417 --> 36:10.533
[Brennan ]
lha i/e information for him.
Hold on.

36:10.627 --> 36:13.334
Booth, the two bruises
on the mastoid process...

36:13.422 --> 36:17.415
were inflicted by two knuckles
on Broadsky’s right fist.

36:17.551 --> 36:19.917
Do you understand
what that means ?
[Two Clicks, Two Beeps]

36:20.012 --> 36:21.752
Dr. Brennan, listen.

36:21.847 --> 36:25.180
If he is playing dueling snipers
with Broadsky, you gotta get
to the point real fast.

36:25.267 --> 36:27.053
Okay.
He struck the mastoid,

36:27.144 --> 36:29.681
which is nearly
44 mill/meters thick.

36:29.772 --> 36:32.764
Ah! Yes! Yes!
Broadsky’s right hand is broken.

36:32.900 --> 36:35.767
You may have just saved my life.

Damn it!

36:58.300 --> 37:00.791
Broadsky! You missed!

37:01.845 --> 37:03.756
Happens to the best of us.

37:07.601 --> 37:09.102
[ Booth ]
Not to you.

37:09.186 --> 37:11.177
Not to me.

37:11.313 --> 37:14.020
You want to give up?
[Clattering ]

37:14.108 --> 37:15.393
You want to give up?

37:15.484 --> 37:17.099
You know that’s not my thing.

38:05.033 --> 38:07.695
Drop your weapon,
or I’ll blow your head off.

38:07.786 --> 38:09.651
[ Broadsky ]
Breaking tradition here.

38:09.746 --> 38:11.737
Snipers go
for high ground, Booth.

38:11.832 --> 38:13.743
Your hand’s broken.
You can’t adjust.

38:15.502 --> 38:17.288
How could you possibly
know that?

38:17.379 --> 38:19.870
The boy you killed—
the squint—

38:19.965 --> 38:21.466
he was a good kid.

38:21.550 --> 38:22.790
You did wrong there.

38:22.885 --> 38:25.877
Collateral damage in the pursuit
of a greater good.

38:25.971 --> 38:28.587
Drop the weapon.
I’m not gonna ask you again.

38:30.100 --> 38:31.556

Booth!

38:38.150 --> 38:39.515
Shut up, Jake.

38:41.153 --> 38:43.735
You’re really so damn positive
you’re the good guy in this?

38:47.618 --> 38:49.199
Yeah. Positive as you are.

38:49.286 --> 38:50.776
Difference is, I’m right.

39:02.591 --> 39:04.752
Yes, I-I understand.

39:04.843 --> 39:06.174
Thank you.

39:06.261 --> 39:07.546
[ Phone Beeps]

39:07.679 --> 39:09.215
Booth got Broadsky.
Yes!

39:09.306 --> 39:10.546
[Laughs]

39:10.641 --> 39:12.131

39:12.226 --> 39:14.467

Yes! Okay.

39:14.561 --> 39:17.143
[ Patting]

Thank God.

39:17.898 --> 39:19.729

[ Sighs ]
Maybe she’s
not coming.

39:35.666 --> 39:37.202
No.SheM—
She’ll be here.

39:37.292 --> 39:41.035
Well, Dr. Brennan has been known
to retreat into hyper-rationalism...

39:41.129 --> 39:42.744
in times of emotional turmoil,

39:42.839 --> 39:44.921
which could very well result in—

39:45.008 --> 39:46.964
Okay, even I want
to slap you now.

39:47.052 --> 39:49.714
All right, guys.
Bones said she will come.

39:49.846 --> 39:51.632
She will definitely be here.

Oh.

40:02.985 --> 40:05.226

Hey, uh— Hey, guys?

40:05.320 --> 40:07.902
Let us handle that, okay?
Okay. Here you go.

40:07.990 --> 40:10.572
Do you— Do you want
to say something?

40:10.659 --> 40:11.865
What? Me? I—

40:11.994 --> 40:13.450
Yeah.
I barely knew him.

40:13.537 --> 40:14.993
That’s true.

40:15.080 --> 40:18.993
Booth only ever called Mr. Nigel-Murray
“the English squintern.”

40:19.084 --> 40:21.245
Wow. Some of us
were worried that
you wouldn’t make it.

40:21.336 --> 40:23.327
I stopped to get this.

40:23.422 --> 40:25.754
Right. Because nothing
says “rest in peace”...

40:25.841 --> 40:28.207
- like a potted plant.
- [ Chuckles ]

40:28.302 --> 40:30.463
Did I do something wrong?

40:30.554 --> 40:34.012
No, honey.
You did something
exactly right.

40:41.064 --> 40:44.431
You know, Vincent gave me
a great piece of advice.

40:44.526 --> 40:49.737
He said the busiest shopping
hour the entire year...

40:49.823 --> 40:51.939
is between 3:00 and 4:00
on Christmas Eve.

40:52.034 --> 40:55.197
So I never shop during that time.

40:55.287 --> 40:58.950
Oh. He told me that
Quebec City in Canada...

40:59.041 --> 41:02.249
has the same amount
of street crime
as Disney World.

41:02.336 --> 41:04.998
So it’s a safe place to visit.

41:05.088 --> 41:07.204
[ Clears Throat]
Vincent informed me...

41:07.299 --> 41:08.960
that the crack of a whip...

41:09.051 --> 41:12.589
was actually the tip
breaking the sound barrier.

41:12.679 --> 41:14.635
He told me that the top
of the Eiffel Tower...

41:14.723 --> 41:17.590
is actually six inches
shorter in the wintertime,

41:17.684 --> 41:20.175
so it’s better to climb it then.

41:21.438 --> 41:24.930
Vincent’s favorite song was
“The Lime in the Coconut.”

41:25.025 --> 41:26.981
Seriously?

41:27.069 --> 41:29.355
’Cause that’s like—
That’s my jam.
