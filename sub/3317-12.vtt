43:57.054 --> 43:58.972
And since it could be any one of you,

43:59.056 --> 44:00.432
you will all be tested.

44:01.308 --> 44:02.518
The Seven Wonders.

44:04.019 --> 44:06.605
Sunday at dawn it begins.

44:07.773 --> 44:09.733
Everyone participates.

44:10.901 --> 44:14.071
And by next week,
we will have a new Supreme.
