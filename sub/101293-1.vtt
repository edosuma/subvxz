00:03.690 --> 00:06.440
(projector runs)

00:23.391 --> 00:26.141
(dramatic music)

00:47.832 --> 00:50.332
(phone rings)

01:03.770 --> 01:04.602
- Sir?

01:06.950 --> 01:08.640
Sir, your wife's on the phone.

01:08.640 --> 01:09.900
- Um, thank you.

01:09.900 --> 01:11.797
Could you close the door on the way out?

01:18.640 --> 01:19.473
Hey Wen.

01:21.510 --> 01:22.343
No no no no.

01:22.343 --> 01:23.933
I think I found a way to help us.

01:25.140 --> 01:27.290
Yeah, I'm sitting here
doing the company bonuses

01:27.290 --> 01:28.773
for the employees, and well,

01:29.610 --> 01:33.510
if I fire Marc, and add his bonus to mine,

01:33.510 --> 01:36.861
no no no, it's a
considerable amount of money.

01:36.861 --> 01:39.611
(dramatic music)

01:41.621 --> 01:44.788
(elevator doors open)

01:50.320 --> 01:53.450
- Marc, Mr. Hamilton needs
to see you right away.

01:53.450 --> 01:54.400
He's in his office.

01:54.400 --> 01:55.233
Go right in.

02:01.989 --> 02:02.822
- Come on in, Marc.

02:07.124 --> 02:08.957
No no, don't sit down.

02:11.039 --> 02:13.290
Marc, what I'm about to
tell you is not easy.

02:15.930 --> 02:16.910
But I regret to inform you

02:16.910 --> 02:19.710
that your services are no
longer needed at this company.

02:20.659 --> 02:24.057
Matter of fact, I'm gonna need you

02:24.057 --> 02:24.890
to take your belongings here,

02:24.890 --> 02:27.073
and I'm gonna need you to
leave the building at once.

02:28.880 --> 02:30.893
And I don't want to
hear a word out of you.

02:33.910 --> 02:36.770
I cannot believe that someone,

02:36.770 --> 02:38.620
filed a sexual complaint against you.

02:42.680 --> 02:45.773
You're lucky that she's
not pressing charges.

02:47.700 --> 02:49.530
No no, not a word, just leave!

02:49.530 --> 02:50.600
Okay, leave the building.

02:50.600 --> 02:53.023
You're lucky you're not leaving
in the back of a cop car.

02:54.299 --> 02:57.049
(dramatic music)

03:05.990 --> 03:07.890
I told him that someone filed

03:07.890 --> 03:09.440
a sexual complaint against him.

03:10.899 --> 03:13.360
No, no one really did, no.

03:13.360 --> 03:14.293
No no no no.

03:15.350 --> 03:17.923
It's a considerable amount of money, Wen.

03:19.200 --> 03:20.520
I didn't want to do it.

03:20.520 --> 03:22.200
But I had to do it.

03:22.200 --> 03:25.150
To save the house and
for you and the boys.

03:25.150 --> 03:27.983
And there might be enough
left over for the car.

03:28.960 --> 03:32.223
Yeah, yeah.

03:33.170 --> 03:34.513
It's gonna be okay, Wen.

03:37.020 --> 03:38.350
He's a smart guy.

03:38.350 --> 03:41.320
He's gonna land on his
feet, he'll be fine.

03:41.320 --> 03:42.233
I promise.

03:43.630 --> 03:45.423
Okay, and Wen?

03:46.600 --> 03:47.433
I love you.

03:48.820 --> 03:50.143
Okay, I'll see you later.

03:51.196 --> 03:52.029
Bye.

03:53.877 --> 03:56.877
(suspenseful music)

04:07.631 --> 04:10.548
(electronic music)

04:54.573 --> 04:57.656
(car engine running)

05:16.392 --> 05:19.225
(car door closes)

05:27.002 --> 05:29.752
(dramatic music)

05:44.142 --> 05:46.975
(peeler scraping)

05:57.922 --> 06:00.339
(door opens)

06:03.693 --> 06:05.460
- I'm home, Wen.

06:05.460 --> 06:06.533
-  Hey babe!

06:06.533 --> 06:07.722
- Hey.
- How was your day?

06:07.722 --> 06:08.904
- Good, good, how was yours?

06:08.904 --> 06:10.410
- Good.

06:10.410 --> 06:11.440
- Good, good.

06:11.440 --> 06:12.660
How was class?

06:12.660 --> 06:13.493
- It was great.

06:14.350 --> 06:16.370
I want to show you one
of the moves I perfected.

06:16.370 --> 06:18.760
Here, let me show you.

06:18.760 --> 06:20.610
Okay, all right backs against the wall.

06:20.610 --> 06:22.322
Your hand is on my throat.

06:22.322 --> 06:23.510
- No.

06:23.510 --> 06:25.700
- I've been practicing, come on.

06:25.700 --> 06:27.584
Come on, come on come on.

06:27.584 --> 06:29.261
- All right.

06:29.261 --> 06:31.072
Whoa, okay.

06:31.072 --> 06:32.173
(Wendy laughs)

06:32.173 --> 06:35.180
Wow, wow okay.

06:35.180 --> 06:36.424
- That's okay.

06:36.424 --> 06:38.220
At last I won't be using it anytime soon.

06:38.220 --> 06:39.170
- No, you will not.

06:41.930 --> 06:43.003
These are beautiful.

06:44.663 --> 06:49.013
Where'd you get them from?

06:49.013 --> 06:49.846
- What?

06:51.464 --> 06:53.392
-  Where'd you get them from?

06:53.392 --> 06:56.227
- I thought they were--

07:00.093 --> 07:03.360
No no no no.

07:03.360 --> 07:05.437
No no, they must be from--

07:07.512 --> 07:09.384
- Okay, it's okay.

07:09.384 --> 07:10.304
Come here.

07:10.304 --> 07:13.584
(Wendy crying)

07:13.584 --> 07:16.334
(dramatic music)

07:35.682 --> 07:36.515
- Hello?

07:37.690 --> 07:38.523
I need help.

07:39.370 --> 07:41.223
For the past year, I've been stalked.

07:42.230 --> 07:44.420
No, I don't know who it is.

07:44.420 --> 07:47.860
But he leaves notes on my car,

07:47.860 --> 07:49.070
and flowers at my house,

07:49.070 --> 07:50.573
and he calls my phone.

07:52.232 --> 07:55.850
He knows where I work
and where I park my car.

07:55.850 --> 07:58.010
He knows where I like to go shopping.

07:58.010 --> 08:01.483
I just don't feel safe anymore.

08:05.750 --> 08:06.713
What do you mean?

08:09.610 --> 08:13.660
You're trying to tell me
there's nothing you can do?

08:13.660 --> 08:15.173
Unless he attacks me?

08:17.430 --> 08:18.623
Hello?

08:22.074 --> 08:25.074
(suspenseful music)

08:32.354 --> 08:34.594
(drawer opens)

08:34.594 --> 08:37.594
(suspenseful music)

08:42.714 --> 08:44.881
(gunshot)

08:54.450 --> 08:55.283
- Wendy?

08:56.154 --> 08:56.987
Are you okay?

09:06.664 --> 09:09.664
(suspenseful music)

09:25.053 --> 09:27.664
(phone buzzes)

09:27.664 --> 09:30.562
(Stalker laughs)

09:30.562 --> 09:33.867
-  Wendy, Wendy, Wendy.

09:33.867 --> 09:36.120
Did you really think
it would be that easy?

09:38.034 --> 09:40.794
(Stalker laughs)

09:40.794 --> 09:43.794
(suspenseful music)

09:45.521 --> 09:47.438
Our fun has just begun.

09:50.114 --> 09:52.864
(knife stabbing)

09:56.122 --> 09:58.122
- Wendy, we've gotta go.

10:08.642 --> 10:11.680
- I killed the meter reader.

10:11.680 --> 10:13.847
I killed the meter reader.

10:15.002 --> 10:17.154
I can't believe I killed the meter reader.

10:17.154 --> 10:19.322
I thought it was that man.

10:19.322 --> 10:21.489
I thought it was that man.

10:22.600 --> 10:24.030
- Okay, here's what we're gonna do.

10:24.030 --> 10:25.910
We're gonna load up the car,
we're gonna get out of here.

10:25.910 --> 10:27.070
I'm gonna call my mother,

10:27.070 --> 10:27.970
talk to her from the road,

10:27.970 --> 10:29.350
and tell her to have the boys ready for us

10:29.350 --> 10:30.293
when we get there.

10:33.910 --> 10:36.043
- We can't put luggage in the trunk.

10:37.304 --> 10:38.704
There's a body in the trunk.

10:41.482 --> 10:42.773
- What's going on?

10:42.773 --> 10:44.013
(Steve and Wendy scream)

10:44.013 --> 10:44.954
- What are you guys doing here?

10:44.954 --> 10:47.210
- Grandpa just dropped us off.

10:47.210 --> 10:48.043
Everything all right?

10:48.043 --> 10:49.800
- Yeah, what's with all the luggage?

10:49.800 --> 10:51.363
- Um your father and I,

10:52.490 --> 10:54.900
your father and I thought
it would be a good idea

10:54.900 --> 10:56.910
if we went to the lakehouse
for a little while.

10:56.910 --> 10:58.504
- Yes, it would really be nice to get away

10:58.504 --> 10:59.554
for a couple of days.

11:00.830 --> 11:02.143
- Okay.
- All right.

11:04.030 --> 11:06.243
- Why don't you boys put
the luggage in the car?

11:07.230 --> 11:08.770
- You just want me to put it in the back?

11:08.770 --> 11:10.900
-  No no no no, in the backseat.

11:10.900 --> 11:12.630
Not the trunk, it's full.

11:12.630 --> 11:13.850
- Why not?

11:13.850 --> 11:15.645
-  Just put it in the backseat.

11:15.645 --> 11:16.478
- Okay.

11:17.754 --> 11:20.754
(suspenseful music)

11:52.013 --> 11:54.763
(dramatic music)

12:30.285 --> 12:32.452
(snoring)

12:36.812 --> 12:39.562
(dramatic music)

12:48.845 --> 12:51.262
(door opens)

13:02.403 --> 13:04.570
(snoring)

13:08.274 --> 13:11.024
(dramatic music)

13:14.354 --> 13:17.187
(muffled yelling)

13:46.354 --> 13:48.114
- Okay guys, here's what we're gonna do.

13:48.114 --> 13:50.290
I need you to take the luggage
and go inside the house.

13:50.290 --> 13:52.197
Your mom and I are gonna get some food.

13:52.197 --> 13:53.370
- And lock the door.

14:10.925 --> 14:13.592
(car starts up)

14:16.594 --> 14:19.594
(suspenseful music)

14:40.405 --> 14:43.155
(shovel digging)

14:48.765 --> 14:51.765
(suspenseful music)

15:25.451 --> 15:28.284
(shovels digging)

15:34.705 --> 15:37.538
(shovels patting)

15:40.956 --> 15:43.706
(dramatic music)

16:05.164 --> 16:07.914
(car doors open)

16:15.793 --> 16:18.230
- Wen, think we should've called the cops,

16:18.230 --> 16:19.950
and told them it was accident.

16:19.950 --> 16:23.680
- If we did that, I would be arrested.

16:23.680 --> 16:25.130
Do you want me to go to jail?

16:27.010 --> 16:30.090
Besides, that stalker guy said

16:30.090 --> 16:32.770
that if we involve the police,

16:32.770 --> 16:35.053
that he would kill the boys.

16:37.554 --> 16:38.387
He is always watching us.

16:38.387 --> 16:40.193
That's not a chance we can take.

16:45.000 --> 16:45.833
I just--

16:49.890 --> 16:52.100
We'll say we were at the lakehouse, okay?

16:52.100 --> 16:53.833
We weren't even home.

16:55.690 --> 16:57.540
If we get questioned.

17:07.492 --> 17:10.242
(dramatic music)

17:58.519 --> 18:01.019
(eggs frying)

18:16.622 --> 18:18.193
- So what are we doing here?

18:21.530 --> 18:22.610
- What are we, on the run?

18:22.610 --> 18:24.110
- Don't be silly.

18:24.110 --> 18:25.083
Your mom and I just thought

18:25.083 --> 18:27.540
it'd be nice to get
away for a little while.

18:27.540 --> 18:28.700
- This sucks.

18:28.700 --> 18:30.770
- I have a party to go to tonight, okay?

18:30.770 --> 18:31.603
I'm going to go.

18:31.603 --> 18:32.900
This stupid trip wasn't my idea.

18:32.900 --> 18:34.782
- I had a championship soccer game,

18:34.782 --> 18:36.080
all right I was going--

18:36.080 --> 18:37.000
- Enough okay?

18:37.000 --> 18:39.000
No one's going anywhere and that's final.

18:39.000 --> 18:40.811
Do you understand me?

18:40.811 --> 18:43.090
- Boys, listen to your father.

18:43.090 --> 18:45.123
I don't want to hear
another word about it.

18:51.380 --> 18:53.250
I'll be going into town in a little bit.

18:53.250 --> 18:55.180
To pick up some supplies.

18:55.180 --> 18:56.220
And I'll call the cable company

18:56.220 --> 18:58.510
and have them set everything up, okay?

18:58.510 --> 19:00.640
You'll be around, right Steve?

19:00.640 --> 19:02.680
- Yeah, I'll be here.

19:04.232 --> 19:07.540
- And boys, I thought it would be nice,

19:07.540 --> 19:10.267
if you invited Mr. Walker
over for dinner tonight.

19:10.267 --> 19:11.763
- Can Josh just go do it?

19:11.763 --> 19:14.013
I really just want to
eat and go back to bed.

19:16.410 --> 19:18.993
- Yeah, I'll invite him over, Mom.

19:21.838 --> 19:22.988
-  I hate eggs.

19:29.027 --> 19:31.444
(rock music)

19:56.318 --> 19:57.820
- Whoa whoa whoa whoa!

19:57.820 --> 19:59.190
Let me get the door for you, pretty lady.

19:59.190 --> 20:00.193
- Oh thanks.

20:08.427 --> 20:11.043
- (sniffs) Oh hi, those are
my favorite right there.

20:12.590 --> 20:13.423
- That's great.

20:14.710 --> 20:18.423
Um, I see you work at the pizza shop.

20:19.860 --> 20:21.600
I was thinking about
ordering pizza for dinner.

20:21.600 --> 20:22.890
- Oh yeah you should.

20:22.890 --> 20:24.140
We're the best in town.

20:24.140 --> 20:26.500
Thirty minutes or less, or it's free.

20:26.500 --> 20:27.333
- Great.

20:28.380 --> 20:30.350
Hey Amelia, it's good to see you.

20:30.350 --> 20:32.280
- Hi Mrs. Hamilton, it's
so nice to see you again.

20:32.280 --> 20:33.113
- Thank you.

20:34.160 --> 20:36.083
Oh, excuse me!

20:38.260 --> 20:39.093
Hello?

20:39.093 --> 20:42.950
Oh yes, uh-huh.

20:42.950 --> 20:45.070
We're just gonna be at our
lakehouse for a little bit.

20:45.070 --> 20:48.803
Can you please set up our
Internet and cable and all that?

20:50.210 --> 20:52.830
Uh-huh, yep today would be best.

20:52.830 --> 20:54.419
Do you think--

20:54.419 --> 20:57.303
Yeah, do you need the address?

20:58.360 --> 21:01.493
Yeah it's 1911 West Lake Drive.

21:02.600 --> 21:05.760
Okay, and somebody will be by today?

21:05.760 --> 21:07.460
All right, great.

21:07.460 --> 21:08.520
Bye.

21:08.520 --> 21:09.827
Sorry about that.

21:09.827 --> 21:10.840
- No problem.

21:10.840 --> 21:13.200
- Could I get two dozen donuts, please?

21:13.200 --> 21:14.920
- Sure thing.

21:14.920 --> 21:16.723
Total is gonna be $19.40.

21:17.649 --> 21:19.610
When did you get into town?

21:19.610 --> 21:24.180
- Oh we got into town yesterday morning.

21:24.180 --> 21:28.500
Yeah, we just decided we need
a little time by the lake.

21:28.500 --> 21:29.380
- That's so nice.

21:29.380 --> 21:31.750
Well, I hope you enjoy
your time at the lake.

21:31.750 --> 21:32.583
- Thank you.

21:32.583 --> 21:33.653
There you go.

21:35.476 --> 21:37.198
Have a great day.

21:37.198 --> 21:39.033
- You too, bye.

21:40.820 --> 21:41.820
- Hey there, Amelia.

21:43.240 --> 21:44.660
Oh man, she's so hot!

21:44.660 --> 21:46.859
And I'm pretty sure she's really into me.

21:46.859 --> 21:48.090
Do you know if she's available?

21:48.090 --> 21:49.710
- I can't believe you just asked me that.

21:49.710 --> 21:50.890
- Oh really, what about you?

21:50.890 --> 21:51.723
Are you single?

21:53.050 --> 21:55.340
- If you aren't going to buy anything,

21:55.340 --> 21:56.543
please leave, you creep.

21:58.718 --> 22:01.739
(bell rings)

22:01.739 --> 22:04.739
(suspenseful music)

22:13.704 --> 22:16.260
(door knocking)

22:16.260 --> 22:17.260
-  Mr. Walker?

22:19.167 --> 22:22.383
Mr. Walker, are you in there?

22:24.130 --> 22:27.120
My mom wanted to invite
you over to dinner tonight.

22:29.195 --> 22:32.195
(suspenseful music)

22:48.626 --> 22:51.543
(knocking on door)

22:58.695 --> 23:00.460
(door opens)

23:00.460 --> 23:02.853
-  Hi, I'm Leon, is Wendy here?

23:03.740 --> 23:04.873
- No, no she's not.

23:06.080 --> 23:07.440
How do you know Wendy?

23:07.440 --> 23:09.590
-  I uh, I talked
to her on the phone.

23:09.590 --> 23:12.100
Yeah, she sounds like a
really nice lady by the way.

23:12.100 --> 23:13.543
Good job, yeah.

23:14.900 --> 23:16.330
I'm here to set up your cable, sir.

23:16.330 --> 23:17.450
- Oh yeah come on in.

23:17.450 --> 23:18.677
- Perfect, thank you.

23:20.615 --> 23:21.448
- It's right over here.

23:21.448 --> 23:23.083
- Wow! Yeah!

23:23.975 --> 23:24.808
I like it.

23:28.095 --> 23:31.012
- It's right here, it's right here.

23:34.295 --> 23:36.245
- That must be Wendy right there, yeah.

23:40.996 --> 23:41.829
All right.

23:42.850 --> 23:44.980
So you and your boys are gone all day,

23:44.980 --> 23:47.633
leaving that beautiful wife
of yours here all alone.

23:49.130 --> 23:51.090
- Look man, why don't
you just do your job?

23:51.090 --> 23:52.630
And leave my family out of it.

23:52.630 --> 23:55.730
- Oh, if that came off the wrong way,

23:55.730 --> 23:58.266
I didn't mean anything by it.

23:58.266 --> 23:59.560
- How long is this gonna take anyway?

23:59.560 --> 24:02.623
- Oh well, I've already
connected your cables outside.

24:04.080 --> 24:08.063
And in here, I am done right now.

24:11.650 --> 24:15.143
Oh hey, I'm gonna need
you to sign right there.

24:24.468 --> 24:26.396
- There you go.

24:26.396 --> 24:27.847
- Thank you.

24:27.847 --> 24:29.133
- All right.

24:32.310 --> 24:33.143
Leon!

24:33.143 --> 24:33.976
- Yeah!

24:37.040 --> 24:38.300
Oh hi Wendy.

24:38.300 --> 24:39.133
- Hi!

24:39.133 --> 24:40.353
- Yeah yeah!

24:45.580 --> 24:46.880
- Pizza for dinner, Steve?

24:53.047 --> 24:56.047
(suspenseful music)

25:21.060 --> 25:22.375
- That's just odd.

25:22.375 --> 25:23.775
(Josh running)

25:23.775 --> 25:25.690
Whoa whoa buddy, what's going on?

25:25.690 --> 25:26.523
- Are you okay?

25:26.523 --> 25:28.210
- There was somebody
following me, I swear.

25:28.210 --> 25:29.560
- No no, it was probably
just a deer or something.

25:29.560 --> 25:31.116
Nothing to worry about.

25:31.116 --> 25:32.803
- Dad, I saw someone following me.

25:32.803 --> 25:34.510
- Okay okay okay.

25:34.510 --> 25:36.760
- You know honey, I'm
sure your father's right.

25:36.760 --> 25:38.893
There's nothing to worry about, okay?

25:41.985 --> 25:44.985
(suspenseful music)

25:52.026 --> 25:57.026
- Uh huh, yeah, thanks for calling Wendy.

25:57.130 --> 25:58.300
Yeah we'll get your order to you in

25:58.300 --> 25:59.490
like thirty minutes or less.

25:59.490 --> 26:00.453
Okay, or it's free.

26:01.610 --> 26:02.893
Yeah, bye.

26:03.880 --> 26:05.850
All righty guys, I need a driver.

26:05.850 --> 26:09.210
Out to Wendy for 1911 West Lake Drive.

26:09.210 --> 26:10.110
Anybody got me?

26:10.110 --> 26:11.270
- Yeah, yeah.

26:11.270 --> 26:12.573
- It's my turn.

26:13.820 --> 26:15.260
Hey, I got it boss.

26:15.260 --> 26:16.093
- Thank you.

26:21.950 --> 26:22.783
- Don't wait up.

26:26.530 --> 26:27.450
- I don't know if I'm gonna be able

26:27.450 --> 26:29.440
to make it tonight, dude.

26:29.440 --> 26:32.280
Look, my parents decided to
plan some stupid unplanned trip

26:32.280 --> 26:33.904
to our lakehouse.

26:33.904 --> 26:34.737
-  Come on man, come on.

26:34.737 --> 26:35.600
You have to come.

26:35.600 --> 26:37.455
It's gonna be so freaking lit.

26:37.455 --> 26:40.180
(Craig whistles)

26:40.180 --> 26:42.430
We've been planning this
party for over a month,

26:42.430 --> 26:44.500
and all the girls are gonna be there.

26:44.500 --> 26:45.430
Megan's gonna be there.

26:45.430 --> 26:46.530
You could ask her out.

26:47.730 --> 26:50.143
- All right, how soon can you be here?

26:51.182 --> 26:52.332
I'll have to sneak out.

26:54.081 --> 26:55.690
(door opens)

26:55.690 --> 26:57.490
Look at that, saved by the bell.

26:57.490 --> 26:59.920
- Hey dudes, is Wendy here?

26:59.920 --> 27:02.070
- Wendy, how do you know my mom?

27:02.070 --> 27:03.553
- We're good friends.

27:03.553 --> 27:06.370
- You are friends with my mom?

27:06.370 --> 27:07.840
- Yup.

27:07.840 --> 27:09.510
- I don't think so.

27:09.510 --> 27:10.450
- Hey Mom!

27:10.450 --> 27:12.720
- Your friend is here.

27:12.720 --> 27:13.553
Craig, was it?

27:16.753 --> 27:18.540
- I'm sorry, is there a problem?

27:18.540 --> 27:20.670
I paid for the pizzas when
I called the order in.

27:20.670 --> 27:21.830
- Hey Wendy, don't you remember me

27:21.830 --> 27:23.361
from the donut store earlier?

27:23.361 --> 27:25.461
Can I help you with the door, pretty lady?

27:26.630 --> 27:29.760
- Right, well thank you so
much for bringing the pizzas.

27:29.760 --> 27:30.710
I hope you have a good night.

27:30.710 --> 27:31.774
- Yeah, but I was thinking--

27:31.774 --> 27:34.274
(door closes)

27:38.490 --> 27:41.650
- So Wen, what's the
story with this pizza guy?

27:41.650 --> 27:43.560
- I don't really know.

27:43.560 --> 27:46.770
I think he was that guy I
met earlier at the store,

27:46.770 --> 27:49.303
but I don't actually know him.

27:53.580 --> 27:55.280
Oh, and it just got creepier.

27:55.280 --> 27:57.210
He sent me a friend request.

27:57.210 --> 27:58.043
Look.

27:58.043 --> 28:00.300
- You gotta block that creep, now.

28:00.300 --> 28:02.620
- He really seemed to like you

28:02.620 --> 28:04.873
in a very kind of special way.

28:06.257 --> 28:09.257
(suspenseful music)

28:11.900 --> 28:13.139
- You know, he kinda reminds me of--

28:13.139 --> 28:15.810
(phone buzzes)

28:15.810 --> 28:17.643
Sorry, I gotta take this.

28:24.940 --> 28:25.773
- Hey Josh.

28:27.132 --> 28:28.020
Do me a favor and go upstairs.

28:28.020 --> 28:29.570
See what your brother is up to.

28:30.770 --> 28:32.503
- Why do I need to go check
up on what Hayden's doing?

28:32.503 --> 28:33.573
He's not a baby.

28:36.730 --> 28:38.843
Okay. (sighs)

28:43.612 --> 28:46.445
(window rattling)

28:58.410 --> 28:59.243
Dude, what are you doing?

28:59.243 --> 29:00.280
- Ssh, dude, get in here.

29:00.280 --> 29:01.790
Shut the door!

29:01.790 --> 29:03.280
- Are you trying to
sneak out to that party?

29:03.280 --> 29:05.480
- Corey's picking me up
in a few minutes, okay?

29:05.480 --> 29:07.430
Don't tell Mom and Dad.

29:07.430 --> 29:09.370
- Wendy, you don't think
Craig is the person

29:09.370 --> 29:11.519
who's been stalking you, do you?

29:11.519 --> 29:13.590
- I don't know.

29:13.590 --> 29:18.590
I mean, maybe he followed us
back from the store earlier.

29:19.320 --> 29:20.153
I don't know.

29:20.153 --> 29:22.440
I didn't see anybody
following us, did you?

29:22.440 --> 29:24.560
- No, I didn't see anybody.

29:24.560 --> 29:25.410
I don't think so.

29:27.110 --> 29:28.870
- I need you to cover for me.

29:28.870 --> 29:30.580
- Okay, but it'll cost you.

29:30.580 --> 29:31.990
- Whatever.

29:31.990 --> 29:32.823
- All righty then.

29:32.823 --> 29:35.449
- I'll give you 25 bucks, okay?

29:35.449 --> 29:37.909
I'll pay you tomorrow.

29:37.909 --> 29:38.920
That's if you don't rat me out.

29:38.920 --> 29:40.120
- Dude look, I got your back.

29:40.120 --> 29:44.740
- Okay, just tell Mom and Dad
I went to bed early, okay?

29:44.740 --> 29:46.160
- Okay, I can do that.

29:50.584 --> 29:53.167
(window opens)

29:56.026 --> 29:59.026
(suspenseful music)

30:02.450 --> 30:06.400
- Hayden said he's really exhausted,

30:06.400 --> 30:07.477
so he's in bed.

30:09.169 --> 30:12.169
(suspenseful music)

30:20.958 --> 30:21.791
(car door opens)

30:21.791 --> 30:24.458
-  Good to see you, man.

30:33.780 --> 30:35.730
- I know it's really hard
on you and your brother.

30:35.730 --> 30:38.860
That you don't get to do
the things you had planned,

30:38.860 --> 30:41.590
but you know, it's really important

30:41.590 --> 30:42.450
that your Dad and I got away

30:42.450 --> 30:44.443
for a couple of days, okay?

30:46.488 --> 30:48.540
- That's all right.

30:48.540 --> 30:51.207
Yeah, don't worry about it, Mom.

30:52.698 --> 30:53.918
(partygoers yelling)

30:53.918 --> 30:55.329
-  So I told her like,
what are you even doing here?

30:55.329 --> 30:57.323
- Have you guys seen Hayden?

30:59.038 --> 30:59.871
- No.

30:59.871 --> 31:01.060
- No, I haven't.

31:01.060 --> 31:03.583
I mean, I invited him, but who knows?

31:04.830 --> 31:07.060
- Dude, I really hope Megan's here.

31:07.060 --> 31:09.038
- I'll let you know whenever he gets here.

31:09.038 --> 31:09.871
- Okay, yeah.

31:09.871 --> 31:11.060
- You'll get VIP treatment,

31:11.060 --> 31:12.628
like you will be the first to know.

31:12.628 --> 31:13.918
- The first.

31:13.918 --> 31:14.751
- You think she's into me?

31:14.751 --> 31:16.748
- Yeah man, the whole school knows

31:16.748 --> 31:18.440
that you guys like each other.

31:18.440 --> 31:20.148
So you just gotta make your move.

31:20.148 --> 31:21.769
Trust me, it's just sometimes--

31:21.769 --> 31:22.980
(boys yell)

31:22.980 --> 31:24.249
(teen laughs)

31:24.249 --> 31:25.860
Dude, grow up man!

31:25.860 --> 31:27.027
- God no, man!

31:29.043 --> 31:30.740
It's good to see you chief.

31:30.740 --> 31:31.740
- Always a pleasure.

31:34.070 --> 31:35.280
- What's up, you guys finally made it.

31:35.280 --> 31:38.223
- Yeah, I told you we were coming.

31:39.390 --> 31:40.500
- You should've seen their faces

31:40.500 --> 31:42.308
when I jumped out at them from behind.

31:42.308 --> 31:43.828
(teen yells and laughs)

31:43.828 --> 31:44.866
- Yeah, you really got us.

31:44.866 --> 31:47.427
- Yeah man, you never saw it coming.

31:49.178 --> 31:51.595
(door opens)

31:54.650 --> 31:55.483
- Hey buddy!

31:58.680 --> 32:01.130
Sorry you didn't get to
go to your party tonight.

32:08.940 --> 32:09.773
Josh!

32:12.180 --> 32:13.013
Josh!

32:15.037 --> 32:16.100
(pop music)

32:16.100 --> 32:19.248
♪ Now I just need to get
something off my chest ♪

32:19.248 --> 32:22.889
♪ I don't know if you're
convinced like this ♪

32:22.889 --> 32:25.680
♪ I think you are fine ♪

32:25.680 --> 32:28.670
- So Hayden, how is your
family vacation going?

32:28.670 --> 32:30.030
- Dude, it's like house arrest over there.

32:30.030 --> 32:32.500
Surprised I was able to sneak out.

32:32.500 --> 32:34.030
- But you got it covered this time, right?

32:34.030 --> 32:35.089
-  Yeah.

32:35.089 --> 32:36.230
- I mean, we don't need your
Mom showing up to this one.

32:36.230 --> 32:38.820
- Oh, I wouldn't mind if
she showed up. (laughs)

32:38.820 --> 32:42.420
- He's got it covered, trust me, okay?

32:42.420 --> 32:44.263
Nobody's gonna even notice he's gone.

32:45.830 --> 32:47.630
- Well, is Megan here?

32:47.630 --> 32:49.910
- Why, you gonna finally ask her out?

32:49.910 --> 32:51.428
- Maybe.

32:51.428 --> 32:53.500
- Do it.

32:53.500 --> 32:54.960
Yeah, do it, dude.

32:54.960 --> 32:57.193
Hey listen, see her?

32:58.190 --> 32:59.023
Right over there?

32:59.023 --> 32:59.900
-  Yeah.

32:59.900 --> 33:02.630
- She has been asking about you all night.

33:02.630 --> 33:03.500
- All night?

33:03.500 --> 33:05.120
- Not kidding, all night.

33:05.120 --> 33:05.953
- I might do it.

33:05.953 --> 33:06.786
- Do it, yeah!

33:06.786 --> 33:07.723
- All right, I'll go for it.

33:09.420 --> 33:10.253
- That's what I'm talking about.

33:10.253 --> 33:11.093
- Yeah boy!

33:12.135 --> 33:14.552
(boys laugh)

33:16.177 --> 33:19.677
(girls murmur and giggle)

33:26.257 --> 33:27.257
- Hey Megan!

33:28.570 --> 33:31.010
So I heard you've been looking for me.

33:31.010 --> 33:31.843
- Maybe.

33:34.010 --> 33:35.700
You don't have to be so
nervous to talk to me.

33:35.700 --> 33:38.488
We've known each other since second grade.

33:38.488 --> 33:39.388
- I'm not nervous.

33:41.268 --> 33:42.518
Maybe a little.

33:43.870 --> 33:45.910
- So what are you waiting for?

33:45.910 --> 33:47.210
All you have to do is ask.

33:48.790 --> 33:50.090
- That's all I have to do?

33:51.017 --> 33:52.067
How's tomorrow night?

33:54.400 --> 33:55.970
- Perfect.

33:55.970 --> 33:57.893
Let me give you my new number.

34:04.790 --> 34:06.323
- Sounds like a plan.

34:13.768 --> 34:16.351
(Megan laughs)

34:18.380 --> 34:20.810
- Sucks you gotta leave already.

34:20.810 --> 34:22.449
At least you got her number.

34:22.449 --> 34:23.610
- That I did, my friend.

34:23.610 --> 34:26.380
In fact, I'm seeing her tomorrow night.

34:26.380 --> 34:27.213
- Oh dude!

34:32.583 --> 34:34.449
Man, it's too bad you can't come with us

34:34.449 --> 34:36.918
to Alex's cabin later this weekend.

34:36.918 --> 34:39.922
My parents aren't expecting
me home til Sunday night.

34:41.739 --> 34:44.610
- Hey man, thanks for the ride tonight.

34:44.610 --> 34:46.409
- Yeah yeah, anytime bro!

34:46.409 --> 34:48.659
- Can I get you to do
me just one more favor?

34:50.438 --> 34:51.271
I'm gonna need a boost,

34:51.271 --> 34:52.933
if I'm gonna sneak back in my window.

34:53.889 --> 34:55.147
- Dude, I got you.

34:56.208 --> 34:59.209
(suspenseful music)

35:02.118 --> 35:03.868
-  Right here.

35:05.068 --> 35:05.985
Gotcha bro!

35:08.878 --> 35:10.263
All right, man, good night.

35:14.427 --> 35:16.016
(window closes)

35:16.016 --> 35:19.016
(suspenseful music)

35:24.350 --> 35:25.990
- Oh hey Dad!

35:25.990 --> 35:28.086
Fancy meeting you in here.

35:28.086 --> 35:30.958
(suspenseful music)

35:30.958 --> 35:34.510
- I'm sick and tired
of you sneaking around

35:34.510 --> 35:35.583
behind our backs.

35:36.720 --> 35:39.508
We told you you couldn't go to the party.

35:39.508 --> 35:42.508
(suspenseful music)

35:43.910 --> 35:44.780
What are you thinking?

35:44.780 --> 35:45.613
You know what, that's it.

35:45.613 --> 35:47.220
You're never thinking.

35:47.220 --> 35:48.053
Go to bed.

35:49.310 --> 35:50.350
You're grounded.

35:50.350 --> 35:51.460
- Dad, you don't understand.

35:51.460 --> 35:53.850
There was a girl at this
party I really had to see.

35:53.850 --> 35:55.340
And I have a date with her tomorrow night.

35:55.340 --> 35:56.330
I can't be grounded.

35:56.330 --> 35:57.830
- I'm sorry, you're not going.

35:58.886 --> 36:00.486
- There's something in my car?

36:00.486 --> 36:01.997
(Stalker stabs)

36:01.997 --> 36:04.580
(Corey groans)

36:11.920 --> 36:13.990
- As a matter of fact,
what you're gonna be doing,

36:13.990 --> 36:15.740
is watching your brother tomorrow night,

36:15.740 --> 36:18.250
while your mother and I go
out, do you understand me?

36:18.250 --> 36:19.396
- Yes sir!

36:19.396 --> 36:20.229
- Go to bed!

36:22.497 --> 36:23.330
Now!

36:31.977 --> 36:33.686
(trunk closes)

36:33.686 --> 36:36.436
(dramatic music)

36:57.216 --> 36:58.817
(knocking on door)

36:58.817 --> 37:01.234
(door opens)

37:02.390 --> 37:03.963
- Hello, can I help you?

37:05.390 --> 37:07.343
- Yes, Ms. Hamilton, I think you can.

37:08.450 --> 37:10.385
Name's Officer Kingsley.

37:10.385 --> 37:11.500
I need to speak to your boy.

37:11.500 --> 37:12.423
Uh Hayden?

37:14.276 --> 37:15.476
He around by any chance?

37:16.560 --> 37:17.900
- Did he do something wrong?

37:17.900 --> 37:18.963
Is he in trouble?

37:21.660 --> 37:23.280
- Yeah, if you don't mind,

37:23.280 --> 37:25.690
I'd like to really just
discuss this with him.

37:25.690 --> 37:27.913
With your permission of course.

37:29.410 --> 37:31.630
- Um sure!

37:31.630 --> 37:33.040
Please come in.

37:33.040 --> 37:34.140
-  Wonderful.

37:37.227 --> 37:38.600
(door closes)

37:38.600 --> 37:40.700
- Get you something to eat or drink?

37:40.700 --> 37:42.220
I'll have to get Hayden from his room.

37:42.220 --> 37:43.873
He's been asleep all day.

37:44.910 --> 37:46.010
- Oh no no no!

37:46.010 --> 37:47.520
No need.

37:47.520 --> 37:48.453
There he is now.

37:53.510 --> 37:55.010
- Mom, what's going on?

37:55.010 --> 37:56.023
Is everything okay?

37:57.290 --> 37:59.513
- Oh, look at that!

38:01.160 --> 38:02.423
Look at that.

38:04.750 --> 38:07.893
Look at that, that is just lovely.

38:11.040 --> 38:13.290
Need to talk to you
about your friend, Corey.

38:14.425 --> 38:16.780
Got a phone call from
his mom this morning.

38:16.780 --> 38:19.830
Apparently, he never
made it home last night.

38:19.830 --> 38:22.870
It's my understanding
that you were with him.

38:22.870 --> 38:24.760
- Yeah yeah, he gave me a ride to a party,

38:24.760 --> 38:27.420
but I don't know why his
mom would've called you.

38:27.420 --> 38:30.120
She wasn't even expecting
him home til tomorrow night.

38:34.630 --> 38:35.463
- Huh!

38:37.190 --> 38:38.650
Well, I mean I got a phone call.

38:38.650 --> 38:39.910
So I need answers.

38:39.910 --> 38:41.650
Think you can do that for me?

38:41.650 --> 38:43.863
- I'm sorry, what was Corey's mom's name?

38:48.580 --> 38:49.903
- He's inquisitive.

38:50.960 --> 38:52.010
You must be so proud.

38:53.497 --> 38:55.700
- To answer your question, no,

38:55.700 --> 38:57.630
I have not talked to him since then.

39:01.526 --> 39:02.660
- Did you mind if I
make a quick phone call?

39:02.660 --> 39:04.370
Just out back real quick.

39:04.370 --> 39:05.770
- Sure, do what you have to.

39:07.020 --> 39:07.853
- Thank you.

39:10.116 --> 39:11.550
(door opens)

39:11.550 --> 39:12.383
Be right back.

39:17.120 --> 39:18.650
- I don't know what it is about that guy,

39:18.650 --> 39:20.670
but I don't like him.

39:20.670 --> 39:22.240
Corey's mom wouldn't have
reported him missing.

39:22.240 --> 39:25.100
She wasn't expecting him
home until tomorrow night.

39:25.100 --> 39:28.497
- Hayden, just let the
officer do his job, okay?

39:28.497 --> 39:30.810
The sooner he finishes up,

39:30.810 --> 39:32.880
the sooner he will be out of here.

39:32.880 --> 39:33.803
- Okay whatever.

39:34.726 --> 39:37.580
(door opens)

39:37.580 --> 39:39.140
- So sorry.

39:39.140 --> 39:43.410
Look, not gonna tie
you up right now, okay?

39:43.410 --> 39:44.850
I'm gonna give you my card.

39:44.850 --> 39:47.040
If you hear from your friend, Corey,

39:47.040 --> 39:47.873
at any point,

39:47.873 --> 39:50.603
please call me.

39:51.870 --> 39:52.703
Please call me.

39:53.540 --> 39:54.770
Good?

39:54.770 --> 39:56.370
Thank you so much for your time.

39:59.090 --> 40:04.090
Hey Wendy, I heard a report
of a missing meter reader

40:04.240 --> 40:05.303
in the next town.

40:06.920 --> 40:07.753
Do be careful.

40:10.210 --> 40:11.060
- Thanks Officer.

40:12.800 --> 40:13.633
- Welcome.

40:15.067 --> 40:16.653
Oh God, (slap) good kid!

40:22.270 --> 40:24.560
- Hayden, if you know
anything about your friend,

40:24.560 --> 40:26.300
please you have to tell someone.

40:26.300 --> 40:28.253
His parents are probably worried sick.

40:29.196 --> 40:33.000
And honey, I can't believe
you snuck out last night.

40:33.000 --> 40:34.923
- Look, I'm really sorry okay?

40:39.906 --> 40:42.665
(water churning)

40:42.665 --> 40:45.415
(dramatic music)

41:00.085 --> 41:03.002
(knocking on door)

41:05.126 --> 41:06.543
- Was a good one.

41:09.640 --> 41:10.513
- Hey Wendy!

41:11.930 --> 41:14.017
- What are you doing here?

41:14.017 --> 41:16.170
Why don't you just leave me alone?

41:16.170 --> 41:17.750
- Listen to what I'm about to say to you,

41:17.750 --> 41:20.330
because I'm only gonna say this one time.

41:20.330 --> 41:22.690
Leave my wife alone.

41:22.690 --> 41:26.760
Stop bringing flowers
to my wife to my house.

41:26.760 --> 41:28.370
Do I make myself clear?

41:28.370 --> 41:29.970
- Chill out man, I didn't
know she was married.

41:29.970 --> 41:31.130
She came on to me.

41:31.130 --> 41:32.497
- I'm warning you.

41:32.497 --> 41:33.330
Get out!

41:34.225 --> 41:35.392
- No no no no!

41:38.353 --> 41:41.103
(dramatic music)

41:55.457 --> 41:57.423
- All I did was say hi.

42:00.070 --> 42:03.105
I don't understand why
people take kindness

42:03.105 --> 42:05.703
to mean that I want to date them.

42:08.640 --> 42:10.740
Hopefully, it's the last we'll see of him.

42:12.960 --> 42:15.283
- For his sake, it better be.

42:25.975 --> 42:28.266
(car door opens)

42:28.266 --> 42:31.266
(suspenseful music)

42:37.457 --> 42:40.235
- How can this day get any effing worse?

42:40.235 --> 42:41.068
(Craig yells)

42:41.068 --> 42:43.818
(dramatic music)

43:05.900 --> 43:06.733
- Hey boys!

43:06.733 --> 43:09.730
Your mom and I are going out
to take care of some business.

43:09.730 --> 43:12.010
Lock the doors, we'll be
back in a little while.

43:12.010 --> 43:15.083
Hayden, don't even think
about leaving the house.

43:17.490 --> 43:19.613
- And boys, don't make too much of a mess.

43:23.897 --> 43:26.177
(door opens)

43:26.177 --> 43:28.927
(dramatic music)

44:22.490 --> 44:24.720
- I need to talk to you about
what happened this morning.

44:24.720 --> 44:27.573
When you and Josh were out fishing.

44:28.490 --> 44:29.870
I didn't want to mention it earlier,

44:29.870 --> 44:31.363
because the boys were around.

44:33.857 --> 44:35.948
- What happened?

44:35.948 --> 44:38.948
(suspenseful music)

44:53.516 --> 44:56.234
(crowbar hits)

44:56.234 --> 44:57.575
(dramatic music)

44:57.575 --> 44:59.055
(Josh yells)

44:59.055 --> 45:01.805
(dramatic music)

45:06.934 --> 45:09.767
(Stalker punches)

45:13.375 --> 45:16.375
(suspenseful music)

45:34.215 --> 45:36.882
(Stalker yells)

45:38.630 --> 45:41.683
- A police officer came by
the house to talk to Hayden.

45:44.570 --> 45:46.420
Corey didn't make it home last night.

45:48.620 --> 45:51.163
But honestly, that's not the worst of it.

45:54.790 --> 45:56.163
He told me to be careful.

45:57.210 --> 45:59.720
Because there's a missing meter reader

45:59.720 --> 46:00.903
in the next town over.

46:02.560 --> 46:06.330
- Did he act as if he knew we
had something to do with it?

46:06.330 --> 46:08.877
- I don't, I don't think he's onto us.

46:08.877 --> 46:12.590
- Do you think he knows we
had something to do with it?

46:12.590 --> 46:14.240
- No, I don't think he knows.

46:14.240 --> 46:16.053
It was more of a warning.

46:20.385 --> 46:21.320
- Wen, I don't know what we're gonna do

46:21.320 --> 46:23.007
if they find out that we did it.

46:28.193 --> 46:31.193
(suspenseful music)

46:38.210 --> 46:40.060
- Hey hey, Hayden, wake up please!

46:40.060 --> 46:41.680
Hayden, wake up!

46:41.680 --> 46:43.746
Wake up, Hayden, wake up!

46:43.746 --> 46:45.556
Hayden, no please please no!

46:45.556 --> 46:47.973
(Josh yells)

47:01.649 --> 47:04.066
(slaps face)

47:05.676 --> 47:07.843
Hayden no, wake up Hayden!

47:12.173 --> 47:13.623
- Look at this mess.

47:17.377 --> 47:19.460
(Josh grunts)

47:19.460 --> 47:21.520
Josh, Hayden, get down here now!

47:21.520 --> 47:22.513
- Josh, Hayden!

47:24.166 --> 47:26.499
(boys yell)

47:28.630 --> 47:31.170
They need to get down here
and clean this mess up.

47:31.170 --> 47:34.040
That boy better not have snuck out again.

47:34.040 --> 47:36.070
Josh, Hayden!

47:36.070 --> 47:38.503
- Great, I'll look
upstairs, you look outside.

47:41.433 --> 47:42.690
(door opens)

47:42.690 --> 47:44.537
- Josh, Hayden!

47:44.537 --> 47:45.915
(crowbar hits)

47:45.915 --> 47:48.665
(dramatic music)

47:53.840 --> 47:55.503
- Steve, did you find them?

47:56.665 --> 47:58.185
Steve!

47:58.185 --> 48:01.836
(pulsating music)

48:01.836 --> 48:04.419
(Wendy grunts)

48:10.985 --> 48:14.177
(body hits closet)

48:14.177 --> 48:16.545
(Stalker breathing loudly)

48:16.545 --> 48:18.663
(hitting face)

48:18.663 --> 48:21.496
(pulsating music)

48:38.607 --> 48:41.357
(dramatic music)

48:49.465 --> 48:52.215
(tools clanging)

49:13.796 --> 49:16.546
(Steve grunting)

49:22.370 --> 49:23.620
- Why are you doing this?

49:24.490 --> 49:26.323
Leave my family alone.

49:27.350 --> 49:28.550
What do you want, what do you want?

49:28.550 --> 49:29.820
What do you want, money?

49:29.820 --> 49:31.370
I'll get you all that you want.

49:33.184 --> 49:34.017
- Please.

49:38.264 --> 49:39.931
-  Answer me!

49:45.347 --> 49:47.873
- Please, just let my children go.

49:51.054 --> 49:51.887
Please.

49:53.774 --> 49:56.756
-  What do you want?

49:56.756 --> 49:59.756
(suspenseful music)

50:12.047 --> 50:13.103
Answer me!

50:15.090 --> 50:18.253
I said answer me now!

50:24.360 --> 50:25.193
- Why?

50:32.180 --> 50:33.190
- Just stop!

50:33.190 --> 50:34.970
Stop what you're doing!

50:34.970 --> 50:35.803
- Why?

50:38.420 --> 50:39.700
- Stop!

50:39.700 --> 50:42.083
- Do I look like one
of your employees, huh?

50:43.880 --> 50:46.753
Do I?

50:49.060 --> 50:50.780
How about now?

50:50.780 --> 50:52.225
- Marc.

50:52.225 --> 50:53.058
- Hi.

50:54.020 --> 50:55.600
- Marc?

50:55.600 --> 50:57.840
- Officer Kingsley, what's going on?

50:57.840 --> 50:58.990
Why are you doing this?

51:03.010 --> 51:04.160
- You didn't tell them.

51:08.240 --> 51:09.073
What?

51:10.545 --> 51:11.378
- You don't have to do this.

51:11.378 --> 51:12.810
- Is this a joke?

51:12.810 --> 51:13.930
- You don't have to do this.

51:13.930 --> 51:16.620
Just stop and think
about what you're doing.

51:16.620 --> 51:18.160
- Did you think about what you did?

51:18.160 --> 51:19.010
- I can fix this, Marc.

51:19.010 --> 51:21.060
- Did you think about what you did?

51:21.060 --> 51:22.520
You can fix it, how?

51:22.520 --> 51:24.100
- Marc, I can make all this go away.

51:24.100 --> 51:24.933
- Make it go away how?

51:24.933 --> 51:25.960
- Figure something out, Marc.

51:25.960 --> 51:27.730
- You can bring my family back?

51:27.730 --> 51:28.680
Please tell me how.

51:29.832 --> 51:30.665
- I'll talk to them.

51:30.665 --> 51:31.498
- Sell me something.

51:31.498 --> 51:32.331
- I'll talk--

51:32.331 --> 51:33.164
- Give me a deal.

51:33.164 --> 51:33.997
- I'll fix it.

51:33.997 --> 51:34.830
Just give me a chance.

51:34.830 --> 51:35.663
- How?

51:35.663 --> 51:36.750
- Let my family go.

51:36.750 --> 51:37.910
They have nothing to do with this.

51:37.910 --> 51:38.743
- Ten, nine,

51:38.743 --> 51:39.770
- I'm who you want.

51:39.770 --> 51:40.603
- Eight, seven.

51:40.603 --> 51:41.935
- I'm who you want, you have me.

51:41.935 --> 51:42.768
- Six, five.

51:42.768 --> 51:43.960
- Let them go, let them go now!

51:43.960 --> 51:44.960
- They're gonna die.

51:46.110 --> 51:47.105
- Marc.

51:47.105 --> 51:49.360
- They're gonna die, four, three.

51:49.360 --> 51:50.193
- Marc stop!

51:50.193 --> 51:51.026
-  Two.

51:51.026 --> 51:52.760
- I can make everything better.

51:52.760 --> 51:54.700
I can fix this.

51:54.700 --> 51:57.653
- Hey, did he tell you what he did?

51:58.960 --> 52:00.152
- No.

52:00.152 --> 52:00.985
- You didn't tell them.

52:00.985 --> 52:01.818
- No I didn't.

52:01.818 --> 52:03.240
- Why not?

52:03.240 --> 52:04.717
- Cause I had to do it.

52:07.752 --> 52:11.570
- You had to do it.

52:11.570 --> 52:12.632
- I had to do it.

52:12.632 --> 52:13.651
- Do you know?

52:13.651 --> 52:14.484
- No.

52:14.484 --> 52:15.861
- Hey, do you know?

52:15.861 --> 52:17.170
- No.

52:17.170 --> 52:18.743
- What is he talking about?

52:20.260 --> 52:23.283
- Your father fired me.

52:25.090 --> 52:28.383
For no good reason.

52:30.240 --> 52:33.013
I lost my job,

52:35.130 --> 52:36.063
my home,

52:39.040 --> 52:40.473
my wife,

52:43.090 --> 52:44.633
my wife!

52:46.270 --> 52:47.983
She took my babies from me.

52:50.570 --> 52:51.403
Imagine it.

52:54.550 --> 52:57.033
Because of him, because of you.

52:58.971 --> 53:03.971
I lost every.

53:04.478 --> 53:05.728
- Please don't.

53:06.638 --> 53:08.305
- I lost everything!

53:12.371 --> 53:14.987
Because of you.

53:14.987 --> 53:17.893
Because of you, I lost everything.

53:18.900 --> 53:21.731
So now these eyes,

53:21.731 --> 53:23.481
open them, open them!

53:24.581 --> 53:25.527
Look at them.

53:25.527 --> 53:28.220
I'm gonna make you watch.

53:28.220 --> 53:29.550
I'm gonna make you watch.

53:29.550 --> 53:30.530
- Stop it!

53:30.530 --> 53:31.413
- Shut up!

53:34.240 --> 53:35.973
I'm gonna make you watch.

53:39.220 --> 53:42.920
So focus.

53:42.920 --> 53:44.743
-  Just think
about what you're doing.

53:44.743 --> 53:45.793
- Hiya buddy!

53:50.500 --> 53:51.833
Now I'm gonna make sure.

53:54.490 --> 53:56.630
This will only take a couple hits, okay?

53:56.630 --> 53:58.813
- Oh Mark, stop stop!

54:02.580 --> 54:03.500
- I'll try to make it quick,

54:03.500 --> 54:05.813
but sometimes it gets
hung up on the spot, okay?

54:06.690 --> 54:09.763
And you, hmm!

54:10.670 --> 54:11.503
Let's see here.

54:13.000 --> 54:14.330
Like Whack-A-Mole?

54:14.330 --> 54:15.890
- No, please no!

54:15.890 --> 54:17.043
- Just stop, Mark!

54:18.780 --> 54:20.343
- You lied!

54:21.670 --> 54:23.370
Daddy's a liar.

54:23.370 --> 54:25.950
I'm not, I'm gonna pop you on the head.

54:25.950 --> 54:27.480
- No, please no!

54:27.480 --> 54:28.543
-  Just stop!

54:31.260 --> 54:32.093
- What a baby!

54:33.021 --> 54:35.771
(dramatic music)

54:41.560 --> 54:42.460
-  Stop it!

54:43.491 --> 54:44.908
-  Please.

54:49.890 --> 54:50.723
- I'm a liar.

54:52.570 --> 54:53.930
I could be your daddy, huh?

55:06.060 --> 55:07.300
You know when I had my
hands around your throat,

55:07.300 --> 55:08.400
and I was choking you,

55:09.470 --> 55:10.763
I felt a connection.

55:12.280 --> 55:13.530
I thought it was special.

55:15.931 --> 55:18.931
You know, you will learn to love me.

55:20.909 --> 55:23.920
I'm looking for a new wife.

55:23.920 --> 55:26.781
(Wendy spits)

55:26.781 --> 55:29.781
(suspenseful music)

55:46.873 --> 55:47.943
I changed my mind.

55:49.290 --> 55:50.803
You are used up.

55:54.100 --> 55:56.793
I don't want you anymore,
cause you hurt my feelings.

56:01.900 --> 56:02.800
It won't be quick.

56:04.680 --> 56:05.930
It will be fun.

56:07.141 --> 56:10.043
And you, you get something special.

56:11.610 --> 56:14.429
Ladies and gentlemen, the main attract--

56:14.429 --> 56:15.839
(Marc yells)

56:15.839 --> 56:19.240
(dramatic music)

56:19.240 --> 56:21.823
(Marc screams)

56:25.530 --> 56:28.280
(dramatic music)

56:51.120 --> 56:53.703
(Wendy crying)

56:55.421 --> 56:58.171
(dramatic music)

59:36.164 --> 59:38.997
(water splashing)

59:45.225 --> 59:48.642
(Marc breathing heavily)

59:57.168 --> 59:59.918
(water dripping)

01:00:04.397 --> 01:00:07.397
(suspenseful music)

01:00:29.372 --> 01:00:32.289
(electronic music)
