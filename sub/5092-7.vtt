00:00.801 --> 00:03.003
*

00:30.364 --> 00:32.100
(sighs heavily)

00:34.768 --> 00:36.104
(sighs)

00:55.389 --> 00:57.625
I just thought you might care
I have homework, that's all.

00:57.658 --> 00:59.593
I have all the confidence
in the world

00:59.627 --> 01:01.529
that you will finish it
between now and then.

01:01.562 --> 01:02.730
Right.

01:02.763 --> 01:04.498
Help yourself,
by all means.

01:04.532 --> 01:05.733
NICKY:
Hi, Pop.
Hi.

01:05.766 --> 01:08.669
HENRY: Oh, um...
two orchestra seats

01:08.702 --> 01:10.604
to the Met's Don Giovanni,

01:10.638 --> 01:11.739
as promised.
Thank you.

01:11.772 --> 01:14.708
I hope it wasn't
too much trouble.
No, not at all.

01:14.742 --> 01:16.610
Stage manager's
an old friend of mine.

01:16.644 --> 01:18.512
Sure you wouldn't want
to scalp those?

01:18.546 --> 01:20.614
'Cause we'd completely
understand if you did.

01:20.648 --> 01:22.650
I'm sorry, but it's
like you're trying
to brainwash me

01:22.683 --> 01:24.285
not to want to be a cop.

01:24.318 --> 01:26.854
Oh, yeah, dragging you
to museums, to the opera,

01:26.887 --> 01:29.457
concerts-- I should
be arrested for child abuse.

01:29.490 --> 01:30.591
What do you think?

01:30.624 --> 01:32.593
Should kids be force-fed
ancient culture?

01:32.626 --> 01:35.863
Only in the case of Sinatra's
music and Billy Wilder's films.

01:35.896 --> 01:36.897
Thank you.

01:36.930 --> 01:38.266
Not helping.

01:38.299 --> 01:39.567
She knows that I'm joking.

01:39.600 --> 01:41.769
Though you may be
the only parent

01:41.802 --> 01:43.537
ever in history

01:43.571 --> 01:45.639
to push their kid into the arts.

01:45.673 --> 01:47.908
Yeah, as opposed to
dodging bullets for
the rest of her life?

01:47.941 --> 01:49.610
You are simplifying
this family's

01:49.643 --> 01:51.679
decades of public service

01:51.712 --> 01:52.913
for dramatic
effect, right?

01:52.946 --> 01:53.914
Just to be clear...

01:53.947 --> 01:55.816
There's my girls.

01:55.849 --> 01:58.519
Francis, Police Sports League

01:58.552 --> 02:01.422
meeting tomorrow--
don't make me show
up empty-handed.

02:01.455 --> 02:03.624
Check's on the hall table.

02:03.657 --> 02:05.559
Expecting many teams this year?

02:05.593 --> 02:08.629
Just fantastic.
Best field yet.

02:08.662 --> 02:10.431
Thanks to you.

02:10.464 --> 02:12.433
Even if I do say so myself.

02:12.466 --> 02:14.635
I'm more than just...

02:14.668 --> 02:16.704
a great cook, you know.

02:16.737 --> 02:18.839
Dad, I know you can hear
this conversation

02:18.872 --> 02:22.176
from the other room, so you
want to weigh in for me?

02:22.210 --> 02:23.677
(sighs)

02:25.213 --> 02:27.648
Roast looks perfect.

02:30.384 --> 02:33.287
HENRY:
Mmm! Mmm!

02:37.958 --> 02:39.793
(knocking on door)

02:46.834 --> 02:48.636
Hey.

02:48.669 --> 02:50.604
I was beginning to think
you stood me up.

02:50.638 --> 02:52.606
I'm glad you didn't.

02:52.640 --> 02:54.808
MAN: I... was
a little nervous.

02:54.842 --> 02:56.877
(clears throat)

02:56.910 --> 02:59.447
Would you mind
turning around?

03:01.014 --> 03:02.916
No problem.

03:03.951 --> 03:05.719
But if you need a hand,

03:05.753 --> 03:07.721
I can be a real
good little helper.

03:07.755 --> 03:09.790
Mm.
So, what do you think?

03:09.823 --> 03:11.992
Let me show you
how helpful I can be.

03:12.025 --> 03:14.628
(panting)
S-Stop...

03:14.662 --> 03:16.830
talking, please.

03:20.801 --> 03:21.702
No!

03:21.735 --> 03:23.937
(screaming):
No!

03:23.971 --> 03:24.972
(sudden puncture, squish)

03:25.005 --> 03:26.240
(screams):
No!

03:26.274 --> 03:27.675
No...!

03:29.977 --> 03:31.312
DESK CLERK:
Yeah, I mean,

03:31.345 --> 03:32.513
I... I've seen her before,

03:32.546 --> 03:35.749
but I never caught her
name or... her real name.

03:35.783 --> 03:37.951
Oh, so hookers are a regular
part of the clientele here?

03:37.985 --> 03:39.753
Hey, I don't pick
who rents a room here.

03:39.787 --> 03:42.256
I'm not the police.
Well, you could've
fooled me.

03:42.290 --> 03:43.691
So let's get this straight.

03:43.724 --> 03:44.592
Nobody reported anything.

03:44.625 --> 03:46.460
No guests said that
anything happened

03:46.494 --> 03:48.896
out of the ordinary
last night.
No. No. They never do.

03:48.929 --> 03:53.667
I mean, I saw some towels
that must've fallen off
a housekeeping cart, but...

03:53.701 --> 03:55.536
Towels?
Yeah.

03:57.070 --> 03:58.839
You stick around.

03:58.872 --> 04:02.376
DAN: Great news--
our only witness is a towel.

04:02.410 --> 04:03.677
JACKIE:
Great.

04:03.711 --> 04:05.313
And she's a Jane Doe; no I.D.

04:05.346 --> 04:06.347
Either she travels light,

04:06.380 --> 04:08.682
or the guy that killed her
took it as a trophy.

04:08.716 --> 04:10.384
What am I smelling here?

04:10.418 --> 04:12.353
It's disinfectant.
He scrubbed her clean.

04:12.386 --> 04:14.488
So no DNA, huh?
Well, it wouldn't have mattered.

04:14.522 --> 04:15.856
There's no evidence
of a sexual encounter.

04:15.889 --> 04:17.625
What are we thinking,
this guy hires a hooker

04:17.658 --> 04:19.393
to kill her
and then give her a bath?

04:19.427 --> 04:20.694
Yeah, maybe
he wanted an audience

04:20.728 --> 04:22.463
while he took care of himself.

04:22.496 --> 04:24.832
What's with the puncture wound?
Well, a tox screen
will tell us

04:24.865 --> 04:26.467
what's in
her system.

04:26.500 --> 04:27.735
Nothing good.

04:27.768 --> 04:29.870
All right, he scoured her;
scour this room.

04:29.903 --> 04:31.004
Find something.

04:58.466 --> 05:00.601
You can call these
your cuts to the bone,

05:00.634 --> 05:03.471
but they still fall short
of the mayor's cost-
reduction targets.

05:03.504 --> 05:04.972
Of course they
do, Garrett.

05:05.005 --> 05:07.741
He brags we're on track for
record lows in violent crime.

05:07.775 --> 05:09.943
How can I do that
with fewer resources?

05:09.977 --> 05:12.946
The answer to that is--
the spirit of shared sacrifice.

05:12.980 --> 05:14.848
That's not an answer;
that's P.R. boiler plate.

05:14.882 --> 05:16.817
No, that's the phrase
that you're gonna preface

05:16.850 --> 05:18.018
every sentence with

05:18.051 --> 05:19.152
for the
foreseeable future.

05:19.186 --> 05:21.922
"In the spirit of shared
sacrifice, with some reductions

05:21.955 --> 05:24.558
"in training and support,
the next class of cadets

05:24.592 --> 05:25.593
can be full strength."

05:25.626 --> 05:27.027
So we keep our numbers high

05:27.060 --> 05:29.730
by sacrificing their training--
that's ass-backwards.

05:29.763 --> 05:31.532
"In the spirit
of shared sacrifice,

05:31.565 --> 05:34.668
"we should consider outsourcing
one of the civilian divisions,

05:34.702 --> 05:36.370
traffic enforcement,
school safety..."

05:36.404 --> 05:38.005
Hey, I got a good
shared sacrifice--

05:38.038 --> 05:40.574
how about we outsource
911 to Bangalore?

05:40.608 --> 05:42.476
All right, Frank, you don't
have to be sarcastic--
Sir.

05:42.510 --> 05:44.978
And how are you gonna
make my day worse, Baker?

05:45.012 --> 05:47.681
You have a request for a meeting
from Sandy Klemmer

05:47.715 --> 05:49.983
of the United Patrolmen's
Association.

05:53.521 --> 05:56.524
Let's put off the UPA for now.

05:56.557 --> 05:57.858
No can do, Frank.

05:57.891 --> 05:58.959
He'll go right
to the press

05:58.992 --> 06:00.160
saying you won't deal
with the union.

06:00.193 --> 06:02.563
(sighs)

06:05.566 --> 06:08.436
And what's your share
of the sacrifice, Garrett,

06:08.469 --> 06:09.670
besides loyalty?

06:09.703 --> 06:11.071
Dignity.

06:11.104 --> 06:13.441
I'll tell them
we'll let them know.

06:18.178 --> 06:20.814
Hey, any luck finding
our Jane Doe's prints

06:20.848 --> 06:23.717
in the system?
Nope. I mean,
she had no priors.

06:23.751 --> 06:26.053
She's either new to the
game, or she's lucky.

06:26.086 --> 06:27.755
Until she was unlucky.

06:27.788 --> 06:29.189
I mean,
the only prints that match

06:29.222 --> 06:30.658
is on the TV remote control,

06:30.691 --> 06:32.025
so maybe she was

06:32.059 --> 06:34.061
watching Jersey Shore,
waiting for her john.

06:34.094 --> 06:36.897
Yeah, or maybe he had her watch
some smut before he killed her.

06:36.930 --> 06:39.800
Either way it's sad.

06:39.833 --> 06:42.002
Or maybe it was neither.

06:42.035 --> 06:43.203
Look at this, Jack.

06:43.236 --> 06:46.139
Hotel records show she accessed
the Internet from her room.

06:46.173 --> 06:48.909
She used the TV to log in
to her e-mail account.

06:48.942 --> 06:50.744
So her last words
were in cyberspace?

06:50.778 --> 06:52.946
Yeah. Let's find out
what they were.

06:57.518 --> 07:00.120
NICKY: This place isn't cold
and impersonal at all.

07:00.153 --> 07:02.490
No, I have no doubt
I'll fall right in love

07:02.523 --> 07:03.491
with Expressionist art.

07:03.524 --> 07:04.825
Nicky, please.

07:04.858 --> 07:07.895
Okay, this does it.

07:07.928 --> 07:10.531
I should definitely
become a cop.

07:10.564 --> 07:11.865
What? Why?

07:11.899 --> 07:15.603
Artists are obviously
seriously disturbed people.

07:15.636 --> 07:17.137
Grandpa's gonna need
all the help he can get

07:17.170 --> 07:18.639
to take care of the EDP calls

07:18.672 --> 07:20.674
coming in from
these guys.
EDP?

07:20.708 --> 07:22.976
Emotionally Disturbed Person.

07:23.010 --> 07:26.046
Yeah, I know what I means;
I just can't believe you do.

07:26.079 --> 07:28.015
NICKY: I mean, this has
to be a cry for help.

07:28.048 --> 07:29.617
MAN:
It was...

07:29.650 --> 07:30.618
actually.

07:30.651 --> 07:32.720
I don't mean
to intrude, but...

07:32.753 --> 07:34.555
that's a very
insightful observation.

07:34.588 --> 07:35.689
Really?

07:35.723 --> 07:37.558
The artist was suffering

07:37.591 --> 07:39.226
from depression at the time.

07:39.259 --> 07:42.996
This period of her work is
fraught with darkness.

07:43.030 --> 07:45.666
It's reflected in
the media she chose,

07:45.699 --> 07:46.867
the colors,

07:46.900 --> 07:50.571
even the abandoned looseness
of the brush strokes, as if...

07:50.604 --> 07:52.740
it didn't matter
where they landed.

07:52.773 --> 07:54.742
Uh, and that one.

07:54.775 --> 07:56.710
Mm.
She knew

07:56.744 --> 07:59.747
she was in trouble, but...
she refused to get help.

07:59.780 --> 08:02.816
She was afraid if she got
better, it would ruin her work.

08:02.850 --> 08:06.654
And then something she never
expected to happen happened.

08:06.687 --> 08:07.655
What?

08:07.688 --> 08:08.488
She fell in love.

08:08.522 --> 08:10.591
Which, to be fair,
brought with it

08:10.624 --> 08:13.093
its own set
of torments.

08:13.126 --> 08:14.762
But...

08:14.795 --> 08:16.564
if Patrick hadn't come along

08:16.597 --> 08:19.700
and given her the courage
to accept help...

08:19.733 --> 08:21.635
I don't know what
might have happened.

08:21.669 --> 08:22.836
How do you know all this?

08:22.870 --> 08:25.806
It's all written
on this little card.

08:25.839 --> 08:26.840
Oh...

08:26.874 --> 08:30.778
I met Holly the artist
when I was evaluating some

08:30.811 --> 08:33.013
of her early work
for one of my clients.

08:33.046 --> 08:36.650
I spent a lot of time
at her studio in Red Hook.

08:36.684 --> 08:40.554
Uh, I could... I could
take you there sometime.

08:42.155 --> 08:43.691
Uh...

08:43.724 --> 08:45.192
Jacob Krystal.

08:45.225 --> 08:46.326
Erin Reagan.

08:46.359 --> 08:47.160
Hi.

08:48.161 --> 08:49.296
Nicky.

08:49.329 --> 08:51.298
Nice to meet you both.

09:00.708 --> 09:02.676
Concessions there.

09:02.710 --> 09:04.745
The Police Sports League
table across the way.

09:04.778 --> 09:06.714
Will you be
providing signage?

09:06.747 --> 09:08.115
You'll have it tomorrow.

09:08.148 --> 09:10.651
Now, reserve this section
for deep pockets.

09:10.684 --> 09:12.753
Maybe if they're next
to the cheerleaders,

09:12.786 --> 09:15.188
it'll put them in
a giving spirit.
(laughs)

09:15.222 --> 09:18.959
Oh, and make sure that the
diamond's squared away, okay?

09:18.992 --> 09:20.360
Okay, you got it.

09:20.393 --> 09:21.829
Okay. Thanks.

09:21.862 --> 09:22.663
Henry.

09:22.696 --> 09:25.032
You're still
bossing people around?

09:25.065 --> 09:27.735
Well, I have to leave the house
to get anybody to listen to me.

09:27.768 --> 09:29.803
How are you, Rick?
Good.

09:29.837 --> 09:31.271
Almost makes me
miss the days

09:31.304 --> 09:33.140
I had you down the hall
as deputy chief.

09:33.173 --> 09:35.843
Well, you were the P.C.-- they
paid me to listen to you.

09:35.876 --> 09:36.777
Not enough, I might add.

09:36.810 --> 09:38.779
How come I haven't seen you

09:38.812 --> 09:40.948
at any of the
league events lately?

09:40.981 --> 09:42.950
I had to back off
on the good deeds.

09:42.983 --> 09:44.151
I went back to work.

09:44.184 --> 09:46.920
What, they're rehiring
washed-up cops?

09:46.954 --> 09:48.622
Where do I stand in line?

09:48.656 --> 09:50.390
Oh, you're not busy enough
with the league,

09:50.423 --> 09:53.226
other charities, all that
quality time with your family?

09:53.260 --> 09:54.662
Oh, yeah, it's great.

09:54.695 --> 09:56.664
Yeah, I know, I know.
Listen...

09:56.697 --> 09:59.800
the outfit is called
Ajax Incorporated.

09:59.833 --> 10:01.835
Private security consultants.

10:01.869 --> 10:04.905
And the people who run it
value experience.

10:04.938 --> 10:06.674
I'm not really looking.

10:06.707 --> 10:07.941
Just drop on by.

10:07.975 --> 10:10.077
Here you go.

10:12.012 --> 10:14.748
Take it easy.

10:18.318 --> 10:20.287
DANNY:
Come on, come on,
come on, hurry up!

10:20.320 --> 10:21.922
Okay, hold on,
just one more minute here.

10:21.955 --> 10:23.824
All right, tell me the
truth-- you hack into

10:23.857 --> 10:25.726
your girlfriend's e-mails
when she's not looking,

10:25.759 --> 10:26.660
and she has no idea.

10:26.694 --> 10:28.929
Uh, I don't...
I don't have a girlfriend.

10:28.962 --> 10:30.898
Mm-hmm.

10:30.931 --> 10:32.299
Okay, uh, here we are.

10:32.332 --> 10:35.836
Your Jane Doe's log-in name
is Bella-Ball,

10:35.869 --> 10:37.337
and her real name
is Stacy Fryman.

10:37.370 --> 10:38.706
Looks like she
liked to cook.

10:38.739 --> 10:41.308
She subscribed to a bunch
of different cooking
Web sites here...

10:41.341 --> 10:43.877
Yeah, a regular aspiring chef.

10:43.911 --> 10:45.879
Chicken scaparella,

10:45.913 --> 10:47.314
baked spaghetti,

10:47.347 --> 10:48.581
mango-pepper marinade.

10:48.615 --> 10:52.219
You know, you might want to jot
some of these recipes down.

10:52.252 --> 10:54.421
Seriously. Single guys love
a girl that can cook, you know.

10:54.454 --> 10:56.289
I use my oven as a dresser.

10:58.926 --> 10:59.827
Look at that.

10:59.860 --> 11:01.962
$600 for a pair of shoes.

11:01.995 --> 11:04.965
Brian Atwood shoes.

11:04.998 --> 11:06.266
Don't judge
what you can't understand.

11:06.299 --> 11:07.901
Hey, hey, here's
something right here.

11:07.935 --> 11:09.903
She did a money
transfer to a Web site

11:09.937 --> 11:11.905
called Kiss-The-Apple.com,
for a ad.

11:11.939 --> 11:13.140
All right,
let's see it.

11:13.173 --> 11:15.408
Okay, here she is.
All right.

11:15.442 --> 11:17.177
This is where
her johns found her.

11:17.210 --> 11:20.480
We gotta dump this cell phone
and see who she spoke to.

11:20.513 --> 11:21.849
Hey, Sarge.

11:21.882 --> 11:23.483
Hey. M.E.'s preliminary report
is in.

11:23.516 --> 11:26.286
Puncture wound
on the neck delivered an opioid

11:26.319 --> 11:28.756
called etorphine
into your victim's system.

11:28.789 --> 11:30.357
It knocked her out.
Then she was smothered.

11:30.390 --> 11:32.059
That's a pretty specific M.O.

11:32.092 --> 11:33.961
That's what I thought,
so I queried VICAP.

11:33.994 --> 11:36.329
Two months ago, Emily Parker,
a hooker from Garden City,

11:36.363 --> 11:37.765
died the same way.

11:37.798 --> 11:38.832
Last month,
Aly Garcia in Jersey.

11:38.866 --> 11:40.734
Son of a bitch is on a roll.

11:45.205 --> 11:47.841
I met Stacy here
after she saw one of our flyers.

11:47.875 --> 11:49.009
She started volunteering

11:49.042 --> 11:50.944
and helped us reap
and sow our vegetables.

11:50.978 --> 11:52.780
Right, and then
she left here,

11:52.813 --> 11:54.314
and went and did
a different kind of hoe-ing?

11:55.348 --> 11:57.350
She said it was good money.

11:57.384 --> 11:58.986
She was saving up
for culinary school.

11:59.019 --> 12:00.453
Right, so that makes it okay?

12:00.487 --> 12:01.822
I didn't say that.

12:01.855 --> 12:03.023
I'm guessing she didn't tell you

12:03.056 --> 12:04.191
that she was an escort?

12:04.224 --> 12:05.358
Well, it's not the kind of thing

12:05.392 --> 12:06.493
you tell a guy
you just started dating.

12:06.526 --> 12:08.829
Mm-hmm.

12:08.862 --> 12:11.264
I was on her computer
making a new flyer,

12:11.298 --> 12:13.901
and she hadn't logged out
of this website, Kiss-The-Apple?

12:13.934 --> 12:16.536
So what? You saw the ad,
and you thought what?

12:16.569 --> 12:19.472
I'm gonna talk to her about it?
I forgave her?

12:19.506 --> 12:21.508
I'm gonna tell her my feelings?

12:21.541 --> 12:23.243
Or did I kill her?
Is that what you're getting at?

12:23.276 --> 12:25.212
Yeah, did you kill her?
No, I didn't kill her.

12:30.818 --> 12:34.054
This was Emily
with her brother.

12:34.087 --> 12:36.356
Long time ago.

12:36.389 --> 12:39.559
Must still be difficult
for you to talk about it.

12:39.592 --> 12:44.497
I lost my daughter long before
she was murdered, Detective.

12:44.531 --> 12:48.035
But the Lord helped me
make peace with that.

12:50.070 --> 12:52.305
So, thank you for your concern.

12:52.339 --> 12:54.441
You can ask me
whatever you like.

12:54.474 --> 12:56.543
Of course.

12:56.576 --> 12:57.610
Um, well, we're thinking

12:57.644 --> 13:00.480
your daughter may be the
first victim in a series.

13:00.513 --> 13:01.849
A series?

13:01.882 --> 13:03.150
Yes, ma'am.
How many?

13:03.183 --> 13:04.885
Three that
we know of.
Oh.

13:04.918 --> 13:05.853
The last
just happened.

13:05.886 --> 13:08.989
What those families
must be going through.

13:09.022 --> 13:11.024
(Danny clears his throat)

13:13.426 --> 13:15.395
Do you mind if sit down?

13:15.428 --> 13:17.030
Please.

13:17.064 --> 13:19.566
Ms. Parker, sometimes
the first victim--

13:19.599 --> 13:21.601
it's very important, um,

13:21.634 --> 13:23.837
because it may have been
someone she knows.

13:23.871 --> 13:25.839
There may be a connection.

13:25.873 --> 13:27.908
Mm, my daughter knew
a lot of people.

13:27.941 --> 13:30.077
All you had to do was pay her.

13:31.979 --> 13:36.850
I know that sounds harsh,
but it was very difficult,

13:36.884 --> 13:38.385
learning what
she had been doing.

13:38.418 --> 13:40.353
Understandable.

13:40.387 --> 13:43.190
I raised my daughter
to believe in God.

13:43.223 --> 13:45.258
I raised her to have values.

13:48.261 --> 13:50.230
Did your daughter ever mention

13:50.263 --> 13:52.232
anyone acting unusual?

13:52.265 --> 13:55.002
Anything in particular she might
have said to you to...?

13:55.035 --> 13:58.305
Mm, no, she hadn't talked to me
in months.

13:58.338 --> 14:00.507
No, when the police
told me what happened,

14:00.540 --> 14:02.242
I wasn't even surprised.

14:03.944 --> 14:06.179
Imagine that.

14:06.213 --> 14:08.615
Getting the news
that any parent would fear,

14:08.648 --> 14:12.986
and only being surprised
that it hadn't happened sooner.

14:21.929 --> 14:22.829
Thank you.

14:22.862 --> 14:25.565
The Mangan deposition's
been pushed to 5:00,

14:25.598 --> 14:28.235
and the Slattery meeting
is set for early next week.

14:28.268 --> 14:30.971
Okay, great.

14:31.004 --> 14:33.340
Oh, um, and this came for you.

14:33.373 --> 14:35.508
Uh, it has been scanned.

14:35.542 --> 14:37.210
It's not a bomb.

14:37.244 --> 14:38.411
From?

14:38.445 --> 14:40.647
From...

14:40.680 --> 14:42.882
uh...

14:44.017 --> 14:45.986
Jacob.

14:46.019 --> 14:48.922
"The artist wanted Nicky
to have this

14:48.956 --> 14:51.058
"as a reminder to be open

14:51.091 --> 14:52.492
"to new possibilities.

14:52.525 --> 14:54.527
While she's thinking that over,
have dinner with..."

14:55.662 --> 14:57.664
Oh.

15:01.601 --> 15:04.904
Well, if you won't have dinner
with him, I will.

15:14.014 --> 15:16.649
JACKIE:
The victim in Long Island
and the one in Jersey--

15:16.683 --> 15:19.686
they both had ads up
on the same Web site.

15:19.719 --> 15:20.620
You got anything
from the families?

15:20.653 --> 15:22.522
Nope. These girls didn't
exactly come home

15:22.555 --> 15:24.091
bragging about the new friends
they'd met,

15:24.124 --> 15:25.658
if they even came home at all.

15:25.692 --> 15:27.961
Girl from New Jersey's family
kept tabs on her

15:27.995 --> 15:29.329
by checking on her ad.

15:29.362 --> 15:31.098
That's how they knew
she was alive?

15:31.131 --> 15:33.300
Yeah.
God.

15:33.333 --> 15:36.103
All right, we got the,
uh, phone records in here.

15:36.136 --> 15:38.105
There's no overlapping
incoming numbers.

15:38.138 --> 15:40.073
No. This killer was smart.

15:40.107 --> 15:42.009
He used his cell phone once,
and then ditched it.

15:42.042 --> 15:44.344
What about
the aspiring chef's boyfriend?

15:44.377 --> 15:45.545
He story check out?

15:45.578 --> 15:47.347
Yeah, he has a strong alibi.

15:47.380 --> 15:49.249
Seems he really loves her,
call girl and all.

15:49.282 --> 15:51.751
Well, I guess there's someone
out there for everyone.

15:51.784 --> 15:54.988
Yeah, yeah. Guess so.

15:55.022 --> 15:57.024
(Jackie sighs)

16:05.765 --> 16:08.001
DANNY:
Don't say it.

16:08.035 --> 16:09.102
I already know.

16:09.136 --> 16:10.637
We got nothing.

16:10.670 --> 16:13.473
No, I wasn't gonna say that.

16:18.078 --> 16:20.080
These girls resemble
anyone you know?

16:21.614 --> 16:23.616
(sighs)

16:34.094 --> 16:36.596
Commissioner, Mr. Klemmer
from the U.P.A.

16:37.630 --> 16:41.168
You're 15 minutes late.

16:41.201 --> 16:42.502
The highway's jammed.

16:43.803 --> 16:46.073
So we have 15 minutes left.

16:46.106 --> 16:48.275
So, let's get to it.

16:48.308 --> 16:51.611
Here's what I've told Collective
Bargaining is off the table:

16:51.644 --> 16:55.282
pension, benefits,
overtime, vacation,

16:55.315 --> 16:57.117
and any attempt
at outsourcing.

16:57.150 --> 16:58.718
And what's on the table?

16:58.751 --> 17:00.653
A wage freeze
for the next fiscal year.

17:00.687 --> 17:02.089
One year.

17:02.122 --> 17:03.790
That's it?

17:03.823 --> 17:06.126
I'm not gonna let the city
balance its books

17:06.159 --> 17:07.227
on the backs of my men.

17:07.260 --> 17:08.161
Your men?

17:08.195 --> 17:10.230
As the elected president

17:10.263 --> 17:11.698
of the United
Patrolmen's Asso...

17:11.731 --> 17:13.300
Your men?

17:13.333 --> 17:16.503
Frank, stand with me,
and I'll stand with you.

17:17.537 --> 17:19.772
Or what?

17:19.806 --> 17:21.541
Or what?!

17:21.574 --> 17:23.643
Come on, Commissioner,
you know the drill.

17:23.676 --> 17:25.312
(sighs)

17:25.345 --> 17:27.114
What drill is that, Sandy?

17:27.147 --> 17:29.349
The one where the union asks
for the whole store

17:29.382 --> 17:30.783
just to get a ham sandwich?

17:30.817 --> 17:33.253
The city pushes back hard--

17:33.286 --> 17:35.222
we're talking demonstrations,

17:35.255 --> 17:36.856
town hall meetings,
and who knows.

17:36.889 --> 17:39.792
Maybe even an outbreak
of the Blue Flu.

17:39.826 --> 17:41.828
(sighs)

17:41.861 --> 17:44.131
You're threatening me
with a sickout?

17:44.164 --> 17:45.832
I'm not threatening you, Frank.

17:45.865 --> 17:47.467
We're on the same side.

17:47.500 --> 17:49.636
I'm just telling you
like it is.

17:49.669 --> 17:52.172
(sighs)

17:52.205 --> 17:54.073
Thanks for stopping by.

18:03.283 --> 18:05.385
(door opens)

18:05.418 --> 18:07.420
(sighs)

18:20.733 --> 18:21.834
(Henry chuckles)

18:21.868 --> 18:24.437
Can you guys manage to get
any work done around here?

18:24.471 --> 18:26.273
Quite a bit.

18:26.306 --> 18:29.142
It's an honor to meet
you, Commissioner.

18:29.176 --> 18:30.343
It's been quite
a few years

18:30.377 --> 18:31.578
since I've been
the commissioner.

18:31.611 --> 18:33.913
Well, you helped
turn this city around.

18:33.946 --> 18:36.149
People haven't
forgotten.

18:36.183 --> 18:38.185
Has Rick here filled you in
on what we do?

18:38.218 --> 18:39.419
Some.

18:39.452 --> 18:41.254
Enough to reel him in
from Brooklyn.

18:41.288 --> 18:43.323
R train. No problem.

18:43.356 --> 18:45.592
He rode it every day
when he was P.C.

18:45.625 --> 18:48.161
Boots on the ground--
there's no substitute.

18:48.195 --> 18:51.231
Rick tells me you might be open
to a consulting position.

18:51.264 --> 18:52.799
Consulting with whom about what?

18:53.900 --> 18:56.169
We have commercial clients

18:56.203 --> 18:58.471
we provide
security services for.

18:58.505 --> 19:01.274
Uh, employee vetting,
anti-shrinkage,

19:01.308 --> 19:02.709
corporate counterespionage.

19:02.742 --> 19:03.776
We're training police forces

19:03.810 --> 19:06.313
in three Caribbean countries
and Eastern Europe.

19:06.346 --> 19:08.281
And, uh,

19:08.315 --> 19:09.949
with the recession here at home,

19:09.982 --> 19:11.884
there are opportunities
to help local departments

19:11.918 --> 19:14.421
with some of their...
nonessential functions.

19:14.454 --> 19:16.789
I'm not sure there are
any nonessential functions--

19:16.823 --> 19:19.559
21st century policing, Henry.

19:19.592 --> 19:21.461
Well, maybe you haven't noticed,

19:21.494 --> 19:23.796
but I'm kind of
a 20th century guy.

19:23.830 --> 19:26.766
With four decades' experience
and a wealth of connections.

19:26.799 --> 19:28.735
We know all about you.

19:28.768 --> 19:30.370
If there's
anything else

19:30.403 --> 19:32.205
you want to know about us...

19:32.239 --> 19:33.273
just ask.

19:38.645 --> 19:41.348
I do not see what
the problem is here.

19:41.381 --> 19:43.550
Running a decoy's
our best option.

19:43.583 --> 19:47.220
Not using you
as the bait, Jackie.

19:47.254 --> 19:50.423
Look, look at those girls,
look at me-- he has a type.

19:50.457 --> 19:52.459
I'm his type.
I'm a serial killer's type.

19:52.492 --> 19:54.594
We're not talking about
a dating site, Jackie.

19:54.627 --> 19:56.929
We're talking about a guy
who's killed three women!

19:56.963 --> 19:58.631
Lighten up, Reagan;
I was kidding.

19:58.665 --> 20:00.567
All right, listen,
she hasworked vice, Reagan.

20:00.600 --> 20:03.770
Come on, Sarge. Look, with
all due respect, busting creeps

20:03.803 --> 20:05.438
from Queens while they're
chasing quickies

20:05.472 --> 20:06.506
is a little bit different

20:06.539 --> 20:08.007
than what we're
talking about here.

20:08.040 --> 20:09.509
Jackie, someone else
can do this--

20:09.542 --> 20:11.010
you don't have to do it.

20:11.043 --> 20:14.247
I know I don't haveto do
this; I wantto do this.
Why?

20:14.281 --> 20:16.849
Because they're just girls
trying to find their way.

20:16.883 --> 20:18.685
And what?
They made some mistakes.

20:18.718 --> 20:20.620
"Some mistakes."
I'd say that's

20:20.653 --> 20:22.455
putting it mildly, Jackie.

20:22.489 --> 20:24.657
You know what, Reagan?

20:24.691 --> 20:27.894
Not everybody grows up
in a great house in Bay Ridge

20:27.927 --> 20:30.330
with a loving family
to fall back on.

20:30.363 --> 20:31.798
What does that mean?

20:31.831 --> 20:34.334
No, seriously, what
the hell does that mean?

20:34.367 --> 20:36.836
Look, I was in high school.

20:36.869 --> 20:38.838
I was a... I was a screwup.

20:38.871 --> 20:40.640
I was fighting with my mom,

20:40.673 --> 20:42.008
fighting with
everyone around me,

20:42.041 --> 20:44.043
skipping school, and
I decided I don't need this,

20:44.076 --> 20:45.345
I'm out of here.

20:45.378 --> 20:46.646
And I went,
I took off,

20:46.679 --> 20:47.914
I ran off to Boston.

20:47.947 --> 20:49.416
And when I returned home,

20:49.449 --> 20:52.585
the locks were changed,
and I was out on my own.

20:52.619 --> 20:55.288
But somehow, I made it here.

20:56.423 --> 20:58.725
It takes one mistake
to change your life.

20:58.758 --> 21:00.727
(sighs)

21:00.760 --> 21:03.663
Let's hope this mistake
doesn't change ourlives, okay?

21:03.696 --> 21:05.832
I want two detectives
backing us up.

21:05.865 --> 21:08.000
I want TARU to wire
that entire hotel,

21:08.034 --> 21:10.370
and you do not leave my sight
for one second.

21:10.403 --> 21:11.471
Okay.

21:11.504 --> 21:13.540
All right, you got authorization
to run for a month.

21:13.573 --> 21:14.674
Thank you.

21:14.707 --> 21:16.676
Let's see the picture.

21:16.709 --> 21:18.511
Say hello
to Michelle.

21:22.549 --> 21:25.352
Tell me I can't do it.

21:25.385 --> 21:26.986
I didn't say you couldn't do it.

21:27.019 --> 21:28.521
I said you shouldn't do it.

21:38.631 --> 21:39.999
Since I know he
won't do it himself,

21:40.032 --> 21:43.002
I just want to take a sec
to toast Pop on his new job.

21:43.035 --> 21:45.472
Wait-- how come
I don't know about this?

21:45.505 --> 21:47.340
At least I'm not
the only one.
Yeah, Pop,

21:47.374 --> 21:48.541
you want to tell
us something?

21:48.575 --> 21:50.510
There's nothing to announce.

21:50.543 --> 21:51.978
I'm just considering.

21:52.011 --> 21:53.380
What are you considering,
Grandpa?

21:53.413 --> 21:56.115
There's a private security firm
called Ajax

21:56.148 --> 21:57.984
that have been
stocking their pond

21:58.017 --> 22:00.720
with old farts from the NYPD.

22:00.753 --> 22:01.521
I met with them.

22:01.554 --> 22:03.890
Can you still cook
Sunday dinner?

22:03.923 --> 22:05.958
(laughter)
Of course I can.

22:05.992 --> 22:08.528
That's wonderful news, Henry,
they're lucky to have you.

22:08.561 --> 22:09.796
Well, we'll see.

22:09.829 --> 22:12.031
So, Nicky,
how did you like the opera?

22:12.064 --> 22:13.600
More than I thought I would--

22:13.633 --> 22:14.834
a lot more
than Expressionist art,

22:14.867 --> 22:15.968
I can tell you that.

22:16.002 --> 22:18.037
It's about exposure,
not judgment.

22:18.070 --> 22:20.940
You just liked it 'cause you got
exposed to that cute guy.

22:20.973 --> 22:22.575
DANNY:
Oh, hey, hold on, whoa.
That's enough, Nicky.

22:22.609 --> 22:23.876
LINDA:
Not enough for me,
come on.

22:23.910 --> 22:26.045
He was a nice guy
who was trying

22:26.078 --> 22:27.847
to explain
the artistic process

22:27.880 --> 22:29.048
to a certain obtuse niece
of yours,

22:29.081 --> 22:30.517
and that's the end
of the story.

22:30.550 --> 22:31.584
(all murmuring)

22:31.618 --> 22:34.887
So I understand that you are
slammed with the unions.

22:34.921 --> 22:37.089
Yeah, the last time
Sandy Klemmer wore a uniform

22:37.123 --> 22:38.525
was Cub Scouts.

22:38.558 --> 22:40.059
(chuckling):
Oh, easy, Francis.

22:40.092 --> 22:42.094
Well, he won't budge
on anything, Pop,

22:42.128 --> 22:45.565
and our side's getting pressured
to farm out nonessential duties.

22:45.598 --> 22:48.067
It's...
JAMIE:
Guys at the precinct are
talking about cutbacks.

22:48.100 --> 22:49.802
Is that last hired,
first fired?

22:49.836 --> 22:52.004
I don't think you got to worry
about losing your job, kid.

22:52.038 --> 22:52.905
The last thing either side wants

22:52.939 --> 22:54.941
is another lawyer
running the streets.

22:54.974 --> 22:55.875
Hey.

22:55.908 --> 22:57.444
I'm just saying...

22:57.477 --> 22:58.845
What-- you're
just saying...?

22:58.878 --> 23:00.079
That I'm just saying.

23:03.850 --> 23:05.552
So they really thinking
about laying people off?

23:05.585 --> 23:06.986
What's wrong?

23:07.019 --> 23:08.988
I figured you'd like having
me around the house more.

23:09.021 --> 23:10.657
I could finally get
to that storm window

23:10.690 --> 23:11.724
you've been
wanting me to fix.

23:11.758 --> 23:12.725
Danny.

23:12.759 --> 23:13.960
I'm just playing.

23:13.993 --> 23:16.162
Come on, this happens
all the time.

23:16.195 --> 23:18.097
Budget issue comes up,
everyone panics,

23:18.130 --> 23:19.966
it all turns out
to be no big deal.

23:19.999 --> 23:22.034
Yeah, the bigger deal is,
you're letting Jackie act

23:22.068 --> 23:23.836
as bait in this little
sting operation of yours.

23:23.870 --> 23:25.104
Hold on.

23:25.137 --> 23:26.973
First of all,
it's not my sting operation.

23:27.006 --> 23:29.175
Second of all, I don't want
Jackie to be the bait.

23:29.208 --> 23:31.644
Oh, it's okay for Jamie
to go undercover

23:31.678 --> 23:33.012
with an organized
crime family,

23:33.045 --> 23:35.047
but if the femaledetective--
that would be...

23:35.081 --> 23:35.982
Did I say that?

23:36.015 --> 23:37.717
Yeah, you said something...

23:37.750 --> 23:38.718
Who said what?

23:38.751 --> 23:39.919
Jackie's going undercover,

23:39.952 --> 23:41.954
and Linda suddenly thinks
she's Gloria Steinem, I guess.

23:41.988 --> 23:43.623
Listen, Jackie
can handle herself--

23:43.656 --> 23:44.624
that's all I'm saying.

23:44.657 --> 23:45.625
I didn't say
she couldn't.

23:45.658 --> 23:47.026
JACKIE:
Knock-knock-knock.

23:47.059 --> 23:51.498
Wow, family of cops
leaving their door open.

23:51.531 --> 23:53.533
Hey, speak
of the devil.

23:53.566 --> 23:54.233
Yes,

23:54.266 --> 23:55.234
that's me.

23:55.267 --> 23:56.603
Hey, Jackie.
You ready?
Wow.

23:56.636 --> 23:57.670
Yeah, hi.

23:57.704 --> 23:58.671
I'll get my stuff.

23:58.705 --> 23:59.672
Great.

23:59.706 --> 24:03.075
So let me guess,
the Great Defender is worried.

24:03.109 --> 24:04.511
Yeah, what do you think?

24:04.544 --> 24:06.546
Yeah.
Hey, good luck out there.

24:06.579 --> 24:08.047
This undercover thing
I'm doing--

24:08.080 --> 24:08.915
it's scary.

24:08.948 --> 24:10.650
I'm always worried
I'm gonna slip up

24:10.683 --> 24:11.984
and, uh, act like the real me.

24:12.018 --> 24:13.920
Right, well, maybe the real you

24:13.953 --> 24:15.888
is a little less criminal
than the real me.

24:17.056 --> 24:19.626
No, I'm, I'm gonna be
fine, thank you.

24:19.659 --> 24:20.893
There's cops
all around,

24:20.927 --> 24:22.061
there's sound, video.

24:22.094 --> 24:23.596
It'll be fine, thanks.

24:23.630 --> 24:26.132
Good. All right.

24:27.600 --> 24:30.770
So you, uh, wearing
the appropriate outfit?

24:30.803 --> 24:33.039
Oh, yeah, well, there you go.

24:33.072 --> 24:34.741
Nice.
Yeah.

24:34.774 --> 24:36.275
Yeah, the calls
just came flooding right in

24:36.308 --> 24:37.910
as soon as her ad went up.

24:37.944 --> 24:40.613
Right, I guess I take that
as a compliment.

24:40.647 --> 24:42.649
All right, I'll wait outside.

24:43.850 --> 24:46.185
Hey, you, eyes up.

24:48.087 --> 24:50.056
Love you, love you.

24:50.089 --> 24:52.491
Love you more.
Love you most.

25:04.103 --> 25:06.505
Let's see her.

25:11.978 --> 25:13.946
(wolf whistles)

25:13.980 --> 25:15.247
Cut it out, Reagan.

25:15.281 --> 25:17.049
What're you doing?

25:17.083 --> 25:18.150
Sorry, Jack.

25:18.184 --> 25:19.786
All right,
video is clear in here.

25:19.819 --> 25:21.053
Let's test your mic.

25:21.087 --> 25:22.989
(blows)

25:23.022 --> 25:24.624
(feedback whines)

25:24.657 --> 25:25.792
(laughs)

25:25.825 --> 25:27.226
All right,
you two in the other room,

25:27.259 --> 25:28.761
your monitors up?

25:28.795 --> 25:30.830
DETECTIVE: All good-- we see
the room and the hall.

25:30.863 --> 25:32.665
Great.

25:33.866 --> 25:35.167
Turn off the phones, remember.

25:35.201 --> 25:37.837
And, uh, this is
my emergency signal, by the way.

25:37.870 --> 25:40.206
That's brilliant, Jack, except
it's not going to get that far.

25:40.239 --> 25:41.273
The minute that creep comes in

25:41.307 --> 25:43.109
and says sex for money,
we're gonna bust in there,

25:43.142 --> 25:44.243
bust him, and search him
for hypodermics.

25:44.276 --> 25:45.778
You got it?

25:47.279 --> 25:50.650
Meanwhile, where am I putting
this with this outfit?

25:50.683 --> 25:52.719
Listen to me, just because
this guy is not into women

25:52.752 --> 25:54.854
sexually does not mean he's not
going to get close to you.

25:54.887 --> 25:57.089
You understand?
Got it.

25:57.123 --> 25:59.325
No, you stay alert.

25:59.358 --> 26:02.161
Got it, Reagan, relax.

26:02.194 --> 26:04.831
Is that a john?

26:04.864 --> 26:07.199
All right,
incoming, come on.

26:11.103 --> 26:13.105
(knocking on door)

26:19.211 --> 26:21.180
Hi.

26:21.213 --> 26:23.215
You'll do.

26:30.757 --> 26:32.959
Klemmer's on the radio.

26:32.992 --> 26:34.093
Want to have a listen?

26:34.126 --> 26:35.127
What's he talking about?

26:35.161 --> 26:36.262
Two guesses.

26:36.295 --> 26:37.263
Respectfully?

26:37.296 --> 26:38.698
Rhetorically.

26:38.731 --> 26:39.398
Call-in show?

26:39.431 --> 26:40.266
Yeah, WNYC.

26:40.299 --> 26:42.368
Got the number?

26:42.401 --> 26:45.071
Don't kid a kidder.

26:46.806 --> 26:48.708
Frank, that's not a good idea.

26:48.741 --> 26:50.276
Then why bring it up?

26:50.309 --> 26:52.178
There's no profit
in escalating this

26:52.211 --> 26:53.412
until we get a firm agenda

26:53.445 --> 26:55.214
as to concessions.

26:55.247 --> 26:57.416
Okay.

26:57.449 --> 27:00.219
Baker, call Klemmer's office
and arrange a meeting

27:00.252 --> 27:01.620
right away.

27:05.792 --> 27:07.059
(sighs)

27:07.093 --> 27:09.896
Another night of sleaze
and desperation.

27:09.929 --> 27:12.765
Ugh, doused
with too much cologne.

27:12.799 --> 27:15.267
What, do you people bathe in it?

27:15.301 --> 27:17.203
Well, you know, Jack,
you wanted to spend your nights

27:17.236 --> 27:18.470
with the lowlifes,
and this is what happens.

27:18.504 --> 27:21.841
You don't get to see the best
the male species has to offer.

27:21.874 --> 27:24.010
Yeah, what else is new?

27:24.043 --> 27:26.312
All right, we got a customer...

27:26.345 --> 27:28.380
who looks
a little familiar.

27:28.414 --> 27:30.082
Zoom in on that.

27:30.116 --> 27:31.083
JACKIE:
Familiar how?

27:31.117 --> 27:33.119
Oh, hold on.

27:33.152 --> 27:36.255
Okay, Jackie,
it's Congressman Albom.

27:36.288 --> 27:38.691
Get out of here.
The family values guy?

27:38.725 --> 27:40.192
Yes, yes, yes, the guy
who was campaigning

27:40.226 --> 27:42.028
with his wife and
daughters by his side.

27:42.061 --> 27:43.062
Listen to me.

27:43.095 --> 27:44.797
We got to make this
quick and painless, okay?

27:44.831 --> 27:47.233
You get him in, he propositions,
we frisk him,

27:47.266 --> 27:48.735
and we send him on his way.

27:48.768 --> 27:50.436
Come on.
No, come on nothing, Jackie,

27:50.469 --> 27:53.239
we're not here to collar
a politician, okay?

27:53.272 --> 27:54.707
If we do, it's front page news

27:54.741 --> 27:56.275
and this whole sting goes
out the window.

27:56.308 --> 27:58.778
(groans) This is one guy
we should collar.

27:58.811 --> 28:00.179
Not if he's not
the killer, okay?

28:00.212 --> 28:02.381
We're not here to bust
some perverted congressman.

28:02.414 --> 28:03.215
If he's not the serial killer,

28:03.249 --> 28:05.251
we get him in
and we get him out.

28:05.284 --> 28:08.154
Okay.

28:10.189 --> 28:12.825
Hello.

28:12.859 --> 28:14.861
Whoa.

28:16.162 --> 28:18.330
You certainly
don't disappoint.

28:18.364 --> 28:21.000
(sniffs)

28:21.033 --> 28:23.035
(both chuckle)

28:24.436 --> 28:26.405
Tough day
at the office?

28:26.438 --> 28:28.841
I don't need the small
talk, if you don't mind.

28:28.875 --> 28:31.143
This is nice.

28:31.177 --> 28:32.411
Is it silk?

28:32.444 --> 28:34.413
What are you playing at, Jackie?

28:34.446 --> 28:37.016
You are handsome.

28:37.049 --> 28:39.819
Really handsome.

28:39.852 --> 28:41.253
You should be on TV.

28:43.055 --> 28:45.024
You are on TV.

28:45.057 --> 28:46.225
(gasps)

28:46.258 --> 28:49.762
That's right, I knew
I recognized you.

28:49.796 --> 28:51.197
Right?
Jackie, st...

28:51.230 --> 28:54.433
Y-You're that, um,
the, uh, the, uh, oh, oh,

28:54.466 --> 28:56.535
the, the car salesman!

28:56.568 --> 28:58.370
Right? Who does
those commercials.

28:58.404 --> 29:00.940
Yeah, you got me.
Ooh, I am lucky, lucky.

29:00.973 --> 29:02.341
You know what?

29:02.374 --> 29:05.344
I think, um, I think
I've changed my mind.
What?

29:05.377 --> 29:07.379
No, I didn't mean
to insult you.

29:07.413 --> 29:09.882
You look more like
a movie star, or a president.

29:09.916 --> 29:11.317
How about a president?

29:13.319 --> 29:15.254
Evening, Congressman.

29:15.287 --> 29:17.389
This is not
what it looks like.

29:17.423 --> 29:18.858
I'm sure it isn't.

29:18.891 --> 29:21.127
Turn around. Put your arms
up in the air, sir.

29:21.160 --> 29:23.195
What?
Put your arms
up in the air

29:23.229 --> 29:26.165
before we charge you with
patronizing a prostitute.

29:26.198 --> 29:29.101
And you don't want us to release
the videos to the press, do you?

29:30.002 --> 29:32.038
No needles.

29:32.071 --> 29:33.505
Go on, get out of here.

29:33.539 --> 29:35.374
Consider this your lucky night.

29:35.407 --> 29:37.944
Say hi to the wife and kids
for me.

29:37.977 --> 29:39.311
Will you stop it?

29:39.345 --> 29:40.880
He's a schmuck.

29:40.913 --> 29:42.014
He is.

29:46.118 --> 29:49.521
Well, you are
a New York District Attorney,

29:49.555 --> 29:51.457
so, yes, I may have
certain assumptions.

29:51.490 --> 29:53.960
Okay, well, I can take it.

29:53.993 --> 29:58.998
Uh... well, you're serious,
conservative.

29:59.031 --> 30:00.967
You probably take
a rather dim,

30:01.000 --> 30:04.470
albeit realistic,
view of human nature.

30:04.503 --> 30:06.605
Well, if you saw...
I wasn't done.

30:06.638 --> 30:08.507
(clearing throat)
I'm sure it doesn't hurt

30:08.540 --> 30:12.444
your case closure rate

30:12.478 --> 30:16.582
that you're also beautiful,
witty, urbane, beautiful...

30:16.615 --> 30:19.318
(laughing):
Okay.

30:20.652 --> 30:26.458
Well, obvious flattery aside,
it is nice to share a dinner

30:26.492 --> 30:28.194
with someone who's
not talking about

30:28.227 --> 30:30.429
the burglary rate
in Bensonhurst

30:30.462 --> 30:31.931
or the virtues of
a nine-millimeter

30:31.964 --> 30:34.300
versus a .38-caliber.

30:34.333 --> 30:35.968
Like every other
man in your life?

30:36.002 --> 30:38.037
Yeah.

30:38.070 --> 30:41.507
You're well-dressed,
well-read, well-traveled.

30:41.540 --> 30:44.310
I don't think those have ever
sounded more like accusations.

30:44.343 --> 30:47.379
No, no, no.

30:47.413 --> 30:48.948
Not at all.

30:52.985 --> 30:55.454
Sandy.
Hey.

30:55.487 --> 30:57.089
Thanks for making the time.

30:57.123 --> 30:58.257
And I'm on time.

30:58.290 --> 30:59.892
Thanks for that, too.

30:59.926 --> 31:03.129
Look, if we got off on the
wrong foot the other day...

31:03.162 --> 31:05.597
We'll take a mulligan.
I'm game if you are.

31:34.193 --> 31:37.529
Atten-hut!

31:37.563 --> 31:43.002
Mr. Klemmer, these are officers
from Harbor, Transit, Housing,

31:43.035 --> 31:44.436
Mounted, Patrol,

31:44.470 --> 31:46.305
Crime Scene,

31:46.338 --> 31:50.542
Emergency Service, Aviation,
Evidence, and Transportation.

31:50.576 --> 31:53.012
All members

31:53.045 --> 31:57.049
of your rank and file.

31:57.083 --> 31:58.484
Take your seats.

32:00.586 --> 32:03.589
I just thought it would
be a good idea

32:03.622 --> 32:06.525
for you to hear from your men

32:06.558 --> 32:08.494
about what to cut
and not to cut.

32:08.527 --> 32:11.530
I'm all ears.

32:11.563 --> 32:13.032
Please sit down.

32:18.237 --> 32:20.206
Oh, and by the way...

32:20.239 --> 32:21.740
not a single one of them

32:21.773 --> 32:24.410
even has the slightest case
of sniffles.

32:24.443 --> 32:29.181
So we won't be talking about
"blue flu," now or ever.

32:35.021 --> 32:38.490
I hope that was informative.

32:38.524 --> 32:40.592
You hope it was coercive.

32:40.626 --> 32:42.461
Look, neither of us
want cuts,

32:42.494 --> 32:43.395
but there will be cuts,

32:43.429 --> 32:45.431
so let's work together
to find which ones

32:45.464 --> 32:46.398
cause the least amount
of bleeding.

32:46.432 --> 32:49.101
Mm. Well, I'm not giving in
to outsourcing.

32:49.135 --> 32:50.669
I'm not asking you to.

32:53.339 --> 32:56.208
Well, a former P.C.
who's close to you,

32:56.242 --> 32:58.010
has hired on with Ajax,
from what I hear.

32:58.044 --> 32:59.211
And they're
counting on that

32:59.245 --> 33:01.013
to make their offer
even more attractive.

33:01.047 --> 33:03.082
Not interested.
You have my word.

33:03.115 --> 33:04.583
Okay.

33:11.723 --> 33:13.059
(sighs)

33:15.761 --> 33:16.728
Coming in, Jack.

33:16.762 --> 33:18.664
Okay.

33:21.700 --> 33:23.769
So you my date?

33:23.802 --> 33:25.304
Nah.

33:25.337 --> 33:26.472
The guy's an hour late.

33:26.505 --> 33:28.474
Mm! Rude.

33:28.507 --> 33:29.675
Yeah.
Looks like he's a no-show,

33:29.708 --> 33:31.543
so I told the guys
to shut it down.

33:31.577 --> 33:33.245
Aw...

33:33.279 --> 33:34.713
Yeah.

33:34.746 --> 33:38.717
Look, I, um...
I wanted to say sorry

33:38.750 --> 33:40.552
for being a pain in the neck.

33:40.586 --> 33:41.553
Huh.

33:41.587 --> 33:44.190
Yeah.
Huh!

33:44.223 --> 33:46.125
You know, my kid
brother's out working

33:46.158 --> 33:48.727
with these Mob guys
undercover.

33:48.760 --> 33:51.497
I don't usually sleep
too good at night.
Yeah.

33:51.530 --> 33:55.167
I worry about my family
and the people I care about.

33:55.201 --> 33:59.138
Which includes you, in case
that wasn't obvious.

34:01.107 --> 34:03.041
Thank you.

34:04.810 --> 34:07.246
I guess, as you know, I...

34:07.279 --> 34:11.850
I've just been on my own
for so long that...

34:11.883 --> 34:14.620
Look, I need you
to have my back; I do.

34:14.653 --> 34:17.489
I just... You don't have
to protect me, you know?

34:17.523 --> 34:18.490
There's a difference.

34:18.524 --> 34:20.159
I know.

34:23.662 --> 34:25.831
I've lost a lot of partners

34:25.864 --> 34:28.767
for a lot of different
reasons, Jack.

34:29.635 --> 34:31.737
I just don't want to lose you.

34:35.741 --> 34:37.609
You're not going to lose me.

34:43.715 --> 34:44.683
You ready?

34:44.716 --> 34:46.852
Mm-hmm.
Okay.

34:48.620 --> 34:49.855
Hey...

34:49.888 --> 34:51.323
I'll wait in the car.

34:57.529 --> 34:59.131
(groans)

35:19.385 --> 35:21.320
Uh, Michelle?

35:21.353 --> 35:26.292
Uh, look, I got
a headache, okay?

35:26.325 --> 35:27.626
Just take it home.

35:27.659 --> 35:29.728
But... we had a date.

35:29.761 --> 35:33.332
Look, kid, go home.

35:33.365 --> 35:35.667
Get a nice girl
in the neighborhood and...

35:35.701 --> 35:38.737
and you just-- you don't
want this, okay?

35:40.706 --> 35:43.609
Hey, hey, hey. Oh...

35:51.817 --> 35:53.519
(quietly):
Come on...

35:54.920 --> 35:56.455
(sighs wearily)

36:02.461 --> 36:06.265
Look, Jack, I hate to be
overbearing and overprotective,

36:06.298 --> 36:09.468
but can you hurry your ass up
please, and get down here,

36:09.501 --> 36:12.238
so I can get home?
Thank you.

36:15.274 --> 36:16.242
(sighs)

36:16.275 --> 36:18.210
She's beautiful.

36:18.244 --> 36:20.379
Yeah, she looks even more like
Emily than in her pictures.

36:20.412 --> 36:22.248
She does.

36:22.281 --> 36:24.650
It's going to be okay.

36:24.683 --> 36:27.353
We'll take you away from
this life of sin.

36:27.386 --> 36:30.222
He'll welcome you back.

36:32.491 --> 36:34.460
You don't need
to be frightened.

36:34.493 --> 36:36.528
(weakly):
No...

36:36.562 --> 36:39.298
I'm a...

36:39.331 --> 36:41.933
I'm... (smacking)

36:41.967 --> 36:43.535
I'm a cop.

36:43.569 --> 36:47.373
Oh, no. You don't need to lie
anymore, my dear.

36:47.406 --> 36:49.508
I'm a cop.

36:53.279 --> 36:54.413
My purse.

36:59.385 --> 37:00.986
Mom...

37:01.019 --> 37:02.220
Hmm?

37:06.525 --> 37:09.328
Hey, can you do me a favor

37:09.361 --> 37:10.929
and walk me up to your
housekeepers on the 12th floor?

37:10.962 --> 37:13.765
They left at 5:00.
What do you mean
they left at 5:00?

37:13.799 --> 37:16.935
I just saw a cart
up on the 12th floor.

37:16.968 --> 37:18.837
I don't know what to tell you,
man-- they left at 5:00.

37:18.870 --> 37:20.906
Oh, you guys typically
let your housekeepers

37:20.939 --> 37:22.674
leave their carts out at night,

37:22.708 --> 37:24.776
so people can just steal
soap and towels and what...

37:27.012 --> 37:28.814
Towels...

37:28.847 --> 37:31.483
Dial 911.
Dial 911 right now!

37:31.517 --> 37:32.818
Listen to me.

37:33.985 --> 37:36.888
You don't understand.
We saved them.

37:36.922 --> 37:39.425
I'm not a prostitute.

37:39.458 --> 37:41.427
I'm a cop.

37:41.460 --> 37:44.996
There has to be some reason
that you're here tonight.

37:46.332 --> 37:49.034
I don't need
to be saved, okay?

37:50.068 --> 37:51.437
This is a test, Mother.

37:51.470 --> 37:52.638
He's testing our faith.

37:52.671 --> 37:55.040
Right, right, right.

37:55.073 --> 37:56.775
I don't know!
If we let her go,
she will stop us.

37:56.808 --> 37:59.311
We'll go to jail.
Don't... No...!

37:59.345 --> 38:00.912
(screaming)

38:00.946 --> 38:02.448
Don't you see?

38:02.481 --> 38:04.783
We have so much more
to accomplish!

38:04.816 --> 38:05.917
You know that!

38:05.951 --> 38:07.953
Please, you don't
want to shoot me.

38:11.623 --> 38:13.325
No!
DANNY: Come on!

38:13.359 --> 38:15.361
Oh, no! Not my son!

38:23.535 --> 38:26.037
Jackie, Jackie,
are you okay?

38:26.071 --> 38:28.574
I'm okay. I'm okay.

38:31.377 --> 38:33.479
You killed your own daughter.

38:33.512 --> 38:34.980
You killed
your own daughter.

38:37.416 --> 38:39.117
Hey, hey, hey.
Come here, come here.

38:39.150 --> 38:41.420
(weakly):
Thank you...
I got you.

38:41.453 --> 38:43.489
I got you.
I got you.

38:43.522 --> 38:47.092
I got you.
It's okay. Hey...

38:47.125 --> 38:49.628
You're all right.
You're all right.

38:49.661 --> 38:53.999
Hang on.
Hang on, Jack.

38:54.032 --> 38:55.867
(panting anxiously)

38:55.901 --> 38:57.703
This is Detective Reagan.

38:57.736 --> 38:58.904
We need a bus.

38:58.937 --> 39:00.872
We have a 10-13.

39:04.175 --> 39:07.112
(slow, romantic, instrumental
swing music playing)

39:11.016 --> 39:12.017
(door shuts)

39:23.995 --> 39:25.964
Evening, Pop.

39:25.997 --> 39:28.534
Francis.

39:31.136 --> 39:32.971
(sighs heavily)

39:35.507 --> 39:37.443
Ah!

39:37.476 --> 39:39.077
Make me one?

39:39.110 --> 39:40.846
Happy to.

39:52.123 --> 39:53.759
Ta.

39:57.463 --> 39:59.197
When does the union
get your budget?

39:59.230 --> 40:04.903
On their desk tomorrow morning,
along with everyone else's.

40:12.644 --> 40:14.746
You know,
the mayor's office sent over

40:14.780 --> 40:17.483
some proposals for outsourcing.

40:17.516 --> 40:18.684
Is that so?

40:18.717 --> 40:20.852
Yeah.

40:20.886 --> 40:24.823
Turns out one of them was
the company you met with.

40:24.856 --> 40:26.892
Ajax?

40:30.929 --> 40:32.631
That's the one.

40:32.664 --> 40:35.701
I called them today and told
them I wasn't interested.

40:37.002 --> 40:38.970
Corporate life's not for me.

40:42.541 --> 40:44.009
Really?

40:44.042 --> 40:47.145
I would have had to spend
a fortune on new suits

40:47.178 --> 40:49.147
just to walk into
that office of theirs.

40:49.180 --> 40:51.182
And the commute--

40:51.216 --> 40:55.987
ever been on the R train
during the rush hour?

40:58.289 --> 41:00.992
Not if I could help it.

41:01.026 --> 41:02.961
And they way they were going on

41:02.994 --> 41:05.964
about how indispensible
I would be, blah, blah, blah.

41:05.997 --> 41:07.833
It was embarrassing.

41:07.866 --> 41:08.900
But true.

41:08.934 --> 41:11.036
Don't you start.

41:15.741 --> 41:17.976
And you would have been
missed around here.

41:20.812 --> 41:22.581
Thank you, son.
