Christmas toilet paper,

She saw this woman on telly
dyeing cocktail onions.

has to be bright red.

prepared anything...

the effort.

if I could come and meet them

when I was about 11,

no yelling or anything.

54:44.322 --> 54:45.702
We just never saw him again.

54:45.802 --> 54:47.862
Except for this one time
at the supermarket,

54:47.962 --> 54:50.663
and my mum just walked past him
like he was invisible.

54:50.763 --> 54:53.563
I don't know if I can
deal with that, Alex.

her Mr Darcy

the shops are great,
and the clothes are fabulous,

01:08:16.696 --> 01:08:18.996
but her in-laws detest her, clearly?

And the other mothers judge her
because she's not like them.

And Mr Darcy is working
all the time,

01:08:24.297 --> 01:08:26.997
so she gets lonely and sad and...

01:08:27.097 --> 01:08:29.918
And suddenly she realises

01:08:30.018 --> 01:08:32.958

she's pretty sure he hates her.
