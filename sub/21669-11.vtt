00:00.717 --> 00:02.671
<i>Previously,
on Hell's Kitchen...</i>

00:02.672 --> 00:04.668
During family steak night...

00:04.669 --> 00:07.238
It's time to start showing
chef Ramsay I mean business.

00:07.239 --> 00:09.106
Patrick was
desperate to shine...

00:09.107 --> 00:10.441
Patrick!
I'm sorry it's raw.

00:10.442 --> 00:12.009
But all he
did was disappoint.

00:12.010 --> 00:13.444
Get out!

00:13.445 --> 00:15.246
Royce...
Chef, three minutes.

00:15.247 --> 00:16.480
Tried to step up for his team.

00:16.481 --> 00:18.649
<i>Hey you...
Rolls-Royce?</i>

00:18.650 --> 00:20.718
Raw, and perfect.

00:20.719 --> 00:22.153
I knew it was
too good to be true.

00:22.154 --> 00:23.387
off.

00:23.388 --> 00:24.722
In the red kitchen...

00:24.723 --> 00:25.890
Fillet, two hanger.
Yes!

00:25.891 --> 00:27.525
You don't need
to scream, Robyn.

00:27.526 --> 00:28.893
No one could get along.

00:28.894 --> 00:29.727
I didn't hear
your garnish, Robyn.

00:29.728 --> 00:31.495
Oh, my God.

00:31.496 --> 00:34.598
The ongoing bad blood
between Robyn and Kimmie...

00:34.599 --> 00:36.734
Kimmie doesn't know
what she's doing.

00:36.735 --> 00:38.302
Hampered their
ability to communicate...

00:38.303 --> 00:39.537
You just told me to run.

00:39.538 --> 00:40.771
And cook.

00:40.772 --> 00:42.039
Are you kidding me?
Touch that.

00:42.040 --> 00:44.275
It's got more wrinkles
on it than I have.

00:44.276 --> 00:46.077
In another fierce battle...

00:46.078 --> 00:47.111
You wanna talk, talk!
Do not yell!

00:47.112 --> 00:48.379
Tiffany...

00:48.380 --> 00:49.647
Tiffany doesn't care.

00:49.648 --> 00:51.215
And Barbie...

00:51.216 --> 00:52.650
I hate the stupid looks
she gives to people.

00:52.651 --> 00:54.518
Exchange jabs all night.

00:54.519 --> 00:58.456
Look at you all.
What a sad situation.

00:58.457 --> 01:00.558
Chef Ramsay tried
to save the dinner service.

01:00.559 --> 01:02.726
Justin, on the fish.

01:02.727 --> 01:04.394
You, on the meat.
Let's go.

01:04.396 --> 01:05.563
But it was beyond saving.

01:05.564 --> 01:06.997
Leave my fish alone.

01:06.998 --> 01:08.599
Talk to me,
somebody, anybody.

01:08.600 --> 01:09.733
Just get off my station, dude.

01:09.734 --> 01:11.602
Stop!
We are not up!

01:11.603 --> 01:12.803
Stone cold.

01:12.804 --> 01:15.539
You, you, you, you, you,
get out!

01:15.540 --> 01:17.041
<i>Get out!</i>

01:17.042 --> 01:18.375
Holy crap.

01:18.376 --> 01:20.010
The winning team tonight...

01:20.011 --> 01:21.445
There's no such thing.

01:21.446 --> 01:22.513
The blue team nominated...

01:22.514 --> 01:24.648
Patrick and Royce.

01:24.649 --> 01:26.050
The red team nominated...

01:26.051 --> 01:28.219
Tiffany and Robyn.

01:28.220 --> 01:30.621
Chef Ramsay
had a burning question.

01:30.622 --> 01:35.092
Tiffany, how much, on a scale
of one to ten, do you care?

01:35.093 --> 01:36.727
Like, a nine.

01:36.728 --> 01:39.330
And Robyn
vigorously defended herself.

01:39.331 --> 01:41.699
I sometimes feel like I protect Kimmie.
Is this true?

01:41.700 --> 01:44.034
Don't turn around,
Christina, 'cause I did.

01:44.035 --> 01:46.337
Oh, really? So now you're
in charge of me too?

01:46.338 --> 01:47.838
<i>This is why I hate
working on the red team.</i>

01:47.839 --> 01:49.206
I'd prefer to be
on the blue team.

01:49.207 --> 01:50.608
In the end,
chef Ramsay sent...

01:50.609 --> 01:52.042
Patrick.

01:52.043 --> 01:53.677
Home.
Good night.

01:53.678 --> 01:54.612
And gave Robyn...

01:54.613 --> 01:56.046
You're joining the blue team.

01:56.047 --> 01:57.848
...Another
chance of chasing her dream

01:57.849 --> 01:58.949
of becoming head chef
at Gordon Ramsay's Steak

01:58.950 --> 02:01.795
at Paris, Las Vegas.

03:02.847 --> 03:03.881
Good night.

03:03.882 --> 03:06.083
Good night, chef.

03:06.084 --> 03:08.252
Whatever the problem is,
we all need to drop it now.

03:08.253 --> 03:09.920
It's gotta be clean slate
starting tomorrow.

03:09.921 --> 03:11.889
Yes! I'm feeling...

03:11.890 --> 03:14.291
<i>Robyn's gone,
and I've been waiting so long.</i>

03:14.292 --> 03:16.627
I am, uh, doing cartwheels
on the inside.

03:16.628 --> 03:19.897
Tomorrow needs to start new.
Moving forward.

03:19.898 --> 03:22.032
<i>We just... we only have five.
We need to...</i>

03:22.033 --> 03:24.168
We gotta come together.
We just ha... we have to.

03:24.169 --> 03:26.537
Can we all get a beer
and toast that ?

03:26.538 --> 03:28.973
While the red team
happily shrugs off the past,

03:28.974 --> 03:30.107
on the blue team...

03:30.108 --> 03:31.609
We're gonna kick some ass.

03:31.610 --> 03:33.310
You know I work better
with boys.

03:33.311 --> 03:35.012
Robyn is fired
up about the future.

03:35.013 --> 03:36.647
I'm on the blue team

03:36.648 --> 03:38.215
where I want to be
on the blue team.

03:38.216 --> 03:40.050
At least the boys don't
walk in with their periods

03:40.051 --> 03:41.885
and don't have catty
when they walk into the kitchen.

03:41.886 --> 03:43.721
Well, I'm just
lettin' you all know,

03:43.722 --> 03:45.556
I'm gonna work
twice as fast as him,

03:45.557 --> 03:47.658
twice as hard as you,
twice as hard as you,

03:47.659 --> 03:49.393
'cause that's my goal.

03:49.394 --> 03:51.328
Robyn... she is happy
to be on the blue team,

03:51.329 --> 03:53.030
and hopefully she feels
she has something to prove,

03:53.031 --> 03:55.032
but we don't need
no controversy,

03:55.033 --> 03:57.301
we don't need no yelling,
none of that kind of thing.

03:57.302 --> 03:58.736
Like, if you're gonna do that,
get the outta here.

03:58.737 --> 04:00.437
I'm not gonna stab
anyone's back. That's not me.

04:00.438 --> 04:02.706
I'm not a backstabber.

04:06.378 --> 04:08.545
After another
team shake-up...

04:08.546 --> 04:10.481
<i>Robyn, let's go.</i>

04:10.482 --> 04:12.416
Both teams
hope to leave last night's

04:12.417 --> 04:14.184
disappointing dinner service
behind them...

04:14.185 --> 04:15.052
<i>Right, good morning.</i>

04:15.053 --> 04:16.754
<i>Morning, chef.</i>

04:16.755 --> 04:19.356
And focus on
what's right in front of them.

04:19.357 --> 04:21.325
<i>Oh, craps.</i>

04:21.326 --> 04:24.762
<i>It's time for Hell's Kitchen
version of craps.</i>

04:24.763 --> 04:25.963
Oh...

04:25.964 --> 04:27.698
I don't know if I like this.

04:27.699 --> 04:29.967
What the are we gonna do
with a crap table?

04:29.968 --> 04:32.403
Now, as you can see,
we have special dice.

04:32.404 --> 04:34.238
Each of you will roll
the dice down the table.

04:34.239 --> 04:36.106
You must choose an ingredient

04:36.107 --> 04:37.541
beginning with that letter.

04:39.411 --> 04:41.278
And come up with
one stunning dish.

04:41.279 --> 04:43.714
<i>Think carefully.</i>

04:43.715 --> 04:47.618
It is absolutely critical that
the ingredients you call out

04:47.619 --> 04:49.153
<i>complement each other.</i>

04:49.154 --> 04:50.554
Let's play craps.

04:50.555 --> 04:52.890
I'm pumped, I'm ready to go.

04:52.891 --> 04:54.858
I've never played craps
for ingredients,

04:54.859 --> 04:56.560
but I'm definitely
feeling lucky at this point.

04:56.561 --> 04:59.330
Okay, men,
you're gonna be up first, yes?

04:59.331 --> 05:01.031
<i>.
Off you go. Big roll.</i>

05:01.032 --> 05:04.668
And it is a...
H.

05:04.669 --> 05:05.669
10 seconds.

05:05.670 --> 05:06.970
Heirloom tomatoes.

05:06.971 --> 05:08.105
Yes.

05:08.106 --> 05:09.640
Heirloom tomato.

05:09.641 --> 05:11.208
And they're
beautiful right now.

05:11.209 --> 05:12.776
It's the key ingredient.
Something we can work with.

05:12.777 --> 05:13.944
<i>Come on, blue team.</i>

05:13.945 --> 05:15.546
Come on, baby.

05:15.547 --> 05:17.915
And you're on a...

05:17.916 --> 05:21.485
D!

05:21.486 --> 05:23.287
Daikon, chef.

05:23.288 --> 05:26.857
Daikon. White radish.

05:26.858 --> 05:28.092
Really? Daikon?

05:28.093 --> 05:31.128
Robyn, let's go.

05:31.129 --> 05:32.529
D! 10 seconds.

05:32.530 --> 05:34.565
Uh, d, d, d-d-d-d...

05:34.566 --> 05:36.333
I'm thinking,

05:36.334 --> 05:38.969
protein, protein, protein,
duck, duck, duck, duck...

05:38.970 --> 05:42.005
Protein, protein, protein,
protein, duck, duck, duck, duck.

05:42.006 --> 05:43.507
Protein, protein,
protein, protein,

05:43.508 --> 05:44.842
duck, duck, duck, duck...

05:44.843 --> 05:46.143
Protein, protein,
protein, protein,

05:46.144 --> 05:47.311
duck, duck, duck, duck.

05:47.312 --> 05:49.213
Dragon fruit.

05:50.915 --> 05:53.450
Holy crap.
You said dragon fruit.

05:53.451 --> 05:55.452
Yeah. It's the only thing
I could think of.

05:55.453 --> 05:57.721
Dragon fruit.

05:57.722 --> 05:59.890
What the
is dragon fruit?

05:59.891 --> 06:01.358
Wow. What a dish.

06:01.359 --> 06:03.227
Brian, let's go.
Come on, Brian.

06:03.228 --> 06:05.796
Come on, baby.

06:05.797 --> 06:07.798
And... E.

06:07.799 --> 06:08.999
E... e...

06:09.000 --> 06:10.000
Five seconds gone.

06:10.001 --> 06:11.668
Uh, .

06:11.669 --> 06:13.570
I'm telling you right now, as
soon as you're standing there,

06:13.571 --> 06:15.172
your mind goes blank.

06:15.173 --> 06:16.373
Uh...

06:16.374 --> 06:17.374
Time up.

06:17.375 --> 06:18.709
<i>Let's go.</i>

06:18.710 --> 06:21.412
Uh...

06:21.413 --> 06:22.546
Blank.

06:22.547 --> 06:25.783
Um...

06:25.784 --> 06:26.817
Edamame.

06:26.818 --> 06:28.318
Uh, guys, um,

06:28.319 --> 06:30.120
I'm not opening a vegetarian
restaurant in Vegas,

06:30.121 --> 06:31.255
<i>let me tell you that.</i>

06:32.557 --> 06:33.991
<i>The blue team</i>

06:33.992 --> 06:35.559
<i>can make a pretty nice salad.</i>

06:35.560 --> 06:36.560
Ugh!

06:38.163 --> 06:39.329
Royce.

06:39.330 --> 06:40.564
<i>Get that protein, Royce.</i>

06:40.565 --> 06:41.865
Come on, Royce.

06:41.866 --> 06:43.901
Right now,
we really need a protein.

06:43.902 --> 06:46.603
I got bubbles in my stomach,
and I'm nervous as hell.

06:46.604 --> 06:48.539
Come on, baby.

06:48.540 --> 06:53.444
<i>And you're on a...
C!</i>

06:55.580 --> 06:59.049
<i>Three, two, one...</i>

06:59.050 --> 07:00.250
Time up.

07:00.251 --> 07:01.819
Chicken.

07:01.820 --> 07:04.688
Chicken. Wow.

07:04.689 --> 07:05.956
Okay.

07:05.957 --> 07:07.524
<i>Let's see what we got.</i>

07:07.525 --> 07:09.193
<i>Right, start off
with heirloom tomatoes,</i>

07:09.194 --> 07:11.762
<i>edamame, dragon fruit,
daikon, and chicken.</i>

07:11.763 --> 07:12.930
Blue team. Good luck.

07:15.033 --> 07:16.633
That's probably the worst
lineup of ingredients

07:16.634 --> 07:17.734
that I've ever seen.

07:17.735 --> 07:18.669
What a bunch of idiots.

07:19.671 --> 07:20.804
Wow. Tiffany, ready?

07:20.805 --> 07:21.872
Yes, chef.
Here we go.

07:21.873 --> 07:23.106
Thank you, chef.

07:23.107 --> 07:24.174
<i>Cheer her on, ladies, let's go.</i>

07:24.175 --> 07:25.709
<i>And...</i>

07:25.710 --> 07:26.777
C!

07:26.778 --> 07:29.646
C... uh...

07:29.647 --> 07:32.716
There's creme
fraiche, there's cauliflower,

07:32.717 --> 07:34.918
calamari,
celery root, celery...

07:34.919 --> 07:36.320
How can you go wrong with that?

07:36.321 --> 07:39.122
Three, two, one...

07:39.123 --> 07:40.257
Chicory.

07:40.258 --> 07:41.358
<i>Chicory.
Mm-hmm.</i>

07:41.359 --> 07:43.627
<i>Wow.
I'm sorry.</i>

07:43.628 --> 07:46.063
Chicory? Ugh. What the ,
dude, like, really?

07:46.064 --> 07:47.364
Barbie, you ready?

07:47.365 --> 07:48.398
<i>I'm ready, chef.
Here we go.</i>

07:48.399 --> 07:49.800
<i>Let's go.</i>

07:49.801 --> 07:51.869
Come on, Barbie.

07:51.870 --> 07:53.704
You got L.

07:53.705 --> 07:55.973
Please don't have a brain fart,
please don't have a brain fart.

07:55.974 --> 07:56.974
Lamb, chef.

07:56.975 --> 07:57.975
Lamb.

07:57.976 --> 07:59.643
Yeah!

07:59.644 --> 08:01.044
Not only do we have a protein,
we have an awesome protein!

08:01.045 --> 08:02.412
Barbie, good job.

08:02.413 --> 08:03.514
<i>Chicory and lamb,
they go good together.</i>

08:04.716 --> 08:06.083
Now they got
something going on,

08:06.084 --> 08:07.317
we could be in trouble.

08:07.318 --> 08:09.319
You got a...

08:09.320 --> 08:10.420
T!

08:10.421 --> 08:12.256
<i>Turnips.
Turnips. Good.</i>

08:12.257 --> 08:14.024
Chicory, lamb, turnips...

08:14.025 --> 08:16.894
Mm, mm, mm, mm, mm...

08:16.895 --> 08:18.695
<i>B!
Brussels sprouts.</i>

08:18.696 --> 08:20.697
Yeah!

08:20.698 --> 08:22.065
Last one. Off you go.

08:22.066 --> 08:23.500
When I get up there,

08:23.501 --> 08:24.902
I'm looking at
the components we have,

08:24.903 --> 08:26.870
and our dish is kind of
coming together

08:26.871 --> 08:30.240
as, like, a nice, like,
kind of fall harvest meal.

08:30.241 --> 08:31.241
T!

08:31.242 --> 08:32.509
Truffles, please.
Truffles.

08:32.510 --> 08:33.710
Okay, great.

08:33.711 --> 08:35.879
Good job. Good pick.
Oh, yeah...

08:35.880 --> 08:37.581
Like, we've got
a classy dish going here.

08:37.582 --> 08:39.116
We have this one in the bag.

08:39.116 --> 08:41.118
Okay, ladies,
there's a quick recap.

08:41.119 --> 08:45.522
<i>Chicory, lamb, turnip,
brussels sprouts, and truffle.</i>

08:45.523 --> 08:47.958
Okay, you've got 30 minutes
to cook one stunning dish.

08:47.959 --> 08:49.760
Your time starts...

08:49.761 --> 08:51.695
Now. Off you go.

08:51.696 --> 08:53.764
While the women
quickly come together...

08:53.765 --> 08:54.865
<i>I'll do the chicory.</i>

08:54.866 --> 08:55.832
I'll do the lamb.

08:55.833 --> 08:56.867
I'll do the brussels sprouts.

08:56.868 --> 08:58.235
I have the truffles.

08:58.236 --> 08:59.870
To design
their fall harvest meal,

08:59.871 --> 09:01.204
over in the blue kitchen...

09:01.205 --> 09:03.006
The dragon fruit.

09:03.007 --> 09:04.975
They're still
searching for a theme

09:04.976 --> 09:07.044
to tie their
ingredients together.

09:07.045 --> 09:08.712
I really don't know
what the

09:08.713 --> 09:09.980
We're gonna do
with dragon fruit,

09:09.981 --> 09:11.048
but I'm trying
to run through it in my head,

09:11.049 --> 09:11.982
and it... it's not easy.

09:11.983 --> 09:13.150
You have daikon,
dragon fruit, and edamame.

09:13.151 --> 09:14.751
<i>You have three asians.</i>

09:14.752 --> 09:16.353
Yeah, we need something
to tie them both in

09:16.354 --> 09:17.354
and bring it all together.

09:17.355 --> 09:19.389
<i>Cool. Let's go.</i>

09:19.390 --> 09:21.325
In spite of not
knowing exactly where their dish

09:21.326 --> 09:22.926
is going to end up,
the blue team gets to work.

09:22.927 --> 09:24.528
But over in the red kitchen...

09:24.529 --> 09:26.697
Oh, my God,
we got fresh truffles.

09:26.698 --> 09:30.467
Barbie wants to be
involved in every element of the dish.

09:30.468 --> 09:32.235
What if we do the turnip puree
the way we did

09:32.236 --> 09:33.737
the salmon last night?

09:33.738 --> 09:36.173
Barbie, we need to get
that lamb in the pan.

09:36.174 --> 09:39.009
But her team wants her to
focus on what she's been assigned.

09:39.010 --> 09:41.578
Lamb has to get
seared immediately.

09:41.579 --> 09:43.614
It's gonna take
the entire time to cook.

09:43.615 --> 09:45.782
<i>How 'bout we
grill the endive?</i>

09:45.783 --> 09:47.417
<i>Barbie, let's
get the lamb going.</i>

09:47.418 --> 09:49.319
Barbie, like, we have to get
the lamb in the pan.

09:49.320 --> 09:50.887
Like, no joke. Come on.

09:50.888 --> 09:52.422
Dana, relax.

09:52.423 --> 09:56.393
It's my thing.
I'm good with the lamb.

09:56.394 --> 09:58.629
While Barbie
stands by her lamb,

09:58.630 --> 10:00.564
I need ice to...

10:00.565 --> 10:03.033
In the blue kitchen...
Very nice.

10:03.034 --> 10:05.268
Brian has finally
fallen for the dragon fruit.

10:05.269 --> 10:07.437
I mean, that looks like sushi.
Yup. I know.

10:07.438 --> 10:08.939
<i>Robyn opens
up the dragon fruit.</i>

10:08.940 --> 10:10.974
I'm like...

10:10.975 --> 10:12.175
Ahh...

10:12.176 --> 10:15.178
I mean, it's like
every planet aligns.

10:15.179 --> 10:17.648
We should do some...
some sort of roll.

10:17.649 --> 10:19.583
What are we doing
with the dragon fruit?

10:19.584 --> 10:21.184
Dragon fruit, we're making
a sushi with it.

10:21.185 --> 10:24.121
Okay. That's good.

10:24.122 --> 10:25.756
Two minutes to go!

10:25.757 --> 10:26.990
Does anyone else want
to taste the brussels sprouts?

10:26.991 --> 10:28.225
Yeah, sure.

10:28.226 --> 10:30.227
<i>Don't put 'em on the plate.
What?</i>

10:30.228 --> 10:30.927
Chef will hate
those crispy leaves.

10:30.928 --> 10:31.561
Don't put 'em on the plate.

10:31.562 --> 10:32.329
They're my favorite ones!

10:32.330 --> 10:33.830
30 seconds to go.

10:33.831 --> 10:35.465
You gotta start slicing
the meat, Barbie, you gotta.

10:35.466 --> 10:37.067
Chicken's almost ready.

10:37.068 --> 10:38.435
It's not gonna have
much time to rest, though.

10:38.436 --> 10:39.736
Justin, I think it's done.

10:39.737 --> 10:41.171
Everybody bring all your
components to the front!

10:41.172 --> 10:42.472
<i>Dragon fruit looks good,
you guys.</i>

10:42.473 --> 10:43.707
Lamb looks great, Barbie.

10:43.708 --> 10:45.409
Thank you.
Perfect.

10:45.410 --> 10:47.210
<i>Royce, be careful
with that bad boy.</i>

10:47.211 --> 10:48.512
I don't think it's ready
to... yeah, it is.

10:48.513 --> 10:50.280
<i>Guys, finesse.</i>

10:50.281 --> 10:51.615
Five, four...

10:51.616 --> 10:53.150
Let's garnish last.
Put the chicken on it.

10:53.151 --> 10:54.985
<i>three, two, one...</i>

10:54.986 --> 10:56.153
And stop!

10:59.223 --> 11:00.924
Okay, red team, blue team,
are you happy with your dish?

11:00.925 --> 11:02.125
Yes, chef.

11:02.126 --> 11:04.327
Okay, red team.
What is it, please?

11:04.328 --> 11:06.863
Our herb-crusted
rack of lamb.

11:06.864 --> 11:10.300
Underneath, we have some crispy,
roasted brussels sprouts

11:10.301 --> 11:14.337
and also some
braised endive with chicory.

11:14.338 --> 11:15.672
Who cooked the lamb?

11:15.673 --> 11:16.807
I did, chef.

11:16.808 --> 11:18.742
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

11:18.743 --> 11:20.644
Great job.

11:20.645 --> 11:22.245
Dana, come on.
I tried to tell you.

11:22.246 --> 11:24.114
That lamb is cooked perfectly.

11:24.115 --> 11:25.982
<i>Thank you, chef.
And that crust is delicious.</i>

11:25.983 --> 11:27.617
Um, brussels sprouts, uh...
Who'd done the sprouts?

11:27.618 --> 11:32.155
I did.

11:33.424 --> 11:36.059
A silly letdown.
They're sort of crunchy.

11:36.060 --> 11:37.928
It's just... I don't know.

11:37.929 --> 11:39.863
<i>I think a little bit more
attention to detail</i>

11:39.864 --> 11:41.331
could've gone into the sprouts.

11:41.332 --> 11:43.433
You know, if
maybe Dana had worried

11:43.434 --> 11:44.935
more about her brussels sprouts

11:44.936 --> 11:46.536
than my lamb...

11:46.537 --> 11:48.171
What a dumbass.

11:48.172 --> 11:49.706
Blue team.

11:49.707 --> 11:51.808
<i>Yes, chef.
What is it, please?</i>

11:51.809 --> 11:53.944
Chef, we have
a charred chicken roulade

11:53.945 --> 11:55.645
with a dragon fruit
vinaigrette,

11:55.646 --> 11:58.615
edamame puree,
and a daikon sushi roll.

12:00.918 --> 12:05.922
The dragon fruit daikon
sushi roll...

12:05.923 --> 12:06.923
is delicious.

12:06.924 --> 12:09.860
Thank you, chef.

12:09.861 --> 12:11.161
Yeah.

12:11.162 --> 12:14.197
Edamame puree...
Tough one to get right.

12:14.198 --> 12:15.699
But you've nailed it,

12:15.700 --> 12:16.833
'cause it's got
that nice, earthy flavor.

12:16.834 --> 12:18.068
Good job, guys.

12:18.069 --> 12:21.138
Yeah, this is a good job.
It's cleverly put together.

12:21.139 --> 12:23.240
But, um, chicken's
slightly overcooked.

12:23.241 --> 12:25.942
I saw Royce slicing
the chicken way too early.

12:25.943 --> 12:27.711
You sliced it piping hot,

12:27.712 --> 12:29.412
which is a big mistake,
because it's dehydrated on top.

12:29.413 --> 12:30.847
I shouldn't have sliced
the chicken too early.

12:30.848 --> 12:33.083
I up.

12:33.084 --> 12:35.819
Um, this is a tough one.
Two very accomplished dishes.

12:35.820 --> 12:39.823
It's a tough one.
Very tough.

12:41.259 --> 12:42.993
<i>There's one dish
that has the edge.</i>

12:42.994 --> 12:46.029
Congratulations...

12:50.162 --> 12:52.163
In the
think-on-your-feet craps challenge,

12:52.164 --> 12:53.832
the teams had to work together

12:53.833 --> 12:56.134
to turn five ingredients
into one balanced entree.

12:56.135 --> 12:58.169
The red team's
herb-crusted lamb dish...

12:58.170 --> 13:00.138
That lamb's cooked perfectly.

13:00.139 --> 13:01.506
Is neck-and-neck
with the blue team's

13:01.507 --> 13:02.907
charred chicken roulade.

13:02.908 --> 13:04.809
That's a good job.
Absolutely delicious.

13:04.810 --> 13:06.544
Leaving chef
Ramsay with a tough decision.

13:06.545 --> 13:07.912
There's one dish
that has the edge.

13:07.913 --> 13:10.036
<i>Congratulations...</i>

13:12.151 --> 13:13.151
Blue team.

13:13.152 --> 13:14.786
Yes!

13:14.787 --> 13:16.888
<i>Good job.
Really good job, indeed.</i>

13:16.889 --> 13:18.656
I feel amazing

13:18.657 --> 13:20.024
winning my first challenge
with the blue team.

13:20.025 --> 13:21.793
I belong on the blue team.

13:21.794 --> 13:24.262
Sweet justice, yo.

13:24.263 --> 13:26.264
Blue team, listen carefully.

13:26.265 --> 13:28.927
You're gonna be spending
the next 24 hours...

13:30.864 --> 13:33.137
in Vegas.

13:33.138 --> 13:34.939
You'll be staying
at the Paris Hotel,

13:34.940 --> 13:36.341
<i>right above
the prize restaurant.</i>

13:36.342 --> 13:37.542
Yes!

13:37.543 --> 13:39.611
<i>Gordon Ramsay's Steak in Vegas.</i>

13:39.612 --> 13:41.279
I've arranged
for a high rollers suite.

13:41.280 --> 13:42.680
Yeah, baby!

13:42.681 --> 13:43.948
<i>Get out of here.
Get changed.</i>

13:43.949 --> 13:46.951
Vegas, baby, Vegas!

13:46.952 --> 13:48.453
Yes!
Vegas, baby!

13:49.788 --> 13:51.222
<i>Ladies...</i>

13:51.223 --> 13:52.490
The sprouts were the letdown.

13:52.491 --> 13:53.992
Undercooked, crunchy.
Wasn't good enough.

13:53.993 --> 13:56.394
Come on, Dana.

13:56.395 --> 13:58.463
Dark, crunchy brussels sprouts?
For real, dude?

13:58.464 --> 14:00.798
Ugh, I'm just so mad.
I'm shaking, I'm so mad.

14:00.799 --> 14:02.600
<i>While the blue team</i>

14:02.601 --> 14:04.536
are off in Vegas
having a late, late night,

14:04.537 --> 14:06.471
<i>you'll be having
a late night as well.</i>

14:06.472 --> 14:08.273
And, in fact, you're gonna
be up all night.

14:08.274 --> 14:10.141
<i>Because you're gonna be
preparing</i>

14:10.142 --> 14:11.509
a very serious special

14:11.510 --> 14:13.144
at tomorrow night's
dinner service.

14:13.145 --> 14:16.147
<i>We are doing the most amazing
pulled pork.</i>

14:16.148 --> 14:18.383
<i>You'll be
slow-roasting the pork.</i>

14:18.384 --> 14:20.251
<i>That's going to take
between 12 and 15 hours.</i>

14:20.252 --> 14:21.586
You're up for a late night.

14:21.587 --> 14:23.288
<i>Kimmie, what's the matter?</i>

14:23.289 --> 14:25.123
<i>Nothing. I'm good.
Get up to the door.</i>

14:25.124 --> 14:26.858
Andi will call you
when she's ready.

14:26.859 --> 14:28.026
Yes, chef.

14:28.027 --> 14:29.260
Kimmie, we lost.

14:29.261 --> 14:30.762
Big deal.
Get over it.

14:30.763 --> 14:32.597
I don't know
why she needs to cry

14:32.598 --> 14:34.666
after every challenge.

14:36.268 --> 14:38.703
,
I wanna go to Vegas so bad.

14:38.704 --> 14:41.239
<i>I'm pissed off at the
crunchy-ass brussels sprouts.</i>

14:41.240 --> 14:43.408
<i>She thinks
she runs our team, dude.</i>

14:43.409 --> 14:44.876
That's her problem,

14:44.877 --> 14:47.545
<i>and that's what
pisses me off so much.</i>

14:47.546 --> 14:50.248
Uh, I just picture her
face on that thing, man.

14:50.249 --> 14:52.050
Dana thinks she's
better than everybody,

14:52.051 --> 14:53.618
and I just wanna wring
Dana's neck right now.

14:53.619 --> 14:55.553
I'm super pissed.

14:55.554 --> 14:58.456
All right,
so why don't we use this time

14:58.457 --> 15:00.525
<i>as a bonding experience?</i>

15:00.526 --> 15:02.527
<i>Vegas!</i>

15:02.528 --> 15:03.695
Vegas, baby, Vegas.

15:03.696 --> 15:06.197
Go yourselves.

15:07.433 --> 15:09.767
Here we go.
Oh, my God.

15:09.768 --> 15:12.036
<i>Let's do it.</i>

15:12.037 --> 15:13.338
<i>Let's go, Vegas, baby.</i>

15:13.339 --> 15:15.607
High five, Vegas.
Yeah, baby.

15:15.608 --> 15:17.475
We're going to Vegas!

15:17.476 --> 15:21.279
Whoo!

15:24.083 --> 15:25.216
Hi, how are you, sir?

15:27.419 --> 15:29.253
<i>Welcome to Paris Las Vegas.</i>

15:29.254 --> 15:30.388
Why don't you follow me
into the suite?

15:30.389 --> 15:32.190
Thank you.
Thank you!

15:32.191 --> 15:34.692
If the president of
this hotel is here greeting us,

15:34.693 --> 15:38.029
we're in store
for something phenomenal.

15:38.030 --> 15:41.032
Wow. You did it right,
man, you did it right.

15:41.033 --> 15:42.467
Thank you, chef!

15:42.468 --> 15:43.568
This is fantastic.

15:43.569 --> 15:47.205
Sushi, lobster, and girls.

15:47.206 --> 15:49.107
There was a total
chocolate dessert buffet,

15:49.108 --> 15:50.341
there was girls.

15:50.342 --> 15:51.909
On the other side of the room,

15:51.910 --> 15:53.277
there was a bar,
and there was more girls.

15:53.278 --> 15:56.214
Then there was food, and girls?

15:56.215 --> 15:59.083
Honey, I'm home!

15:59.084 --> 16:00.785
You go to Vegas,
go big or go home,

16:00.786 --> 16:03.488
and chef Ramsay
knows how to go big.

16:03.489 --> 16:05.857
Look at the size
of those shrimp.

16:05.858 --> 16:07.959
We're all excited.

16:07.960 --> 16:09.594
We have no idea
where we're going,

16:09.595 --> 16:10.795
but we know it's gonna be good,

16:10.796 --> 16:11.763
and we know
it's gonna be totally VIP.

16:11.764 --> 16:14.165
Salut!

16:14.166 --> 16:16.701
While the blue team prepares
for an exciting night in Sin City,

16:16.702 --> 16:18.369
back at Hell's Kitchen,
Tiffany...

16:18.370 --> 16:19.671
Isn't she cute?

16:19.672 --> 16:23.441
Prepares for a hot date
with some pork.

16:23.442 --> 16:25.710
I'm gonna try my best
to just take care of that pig,

16:25.711 --> 16:27.178
'cause he needs me.

16:30.783 --> 16:32.050
I'm gonna smell good tonight.

16:32.051 --> 16:33.584
Pig and I bonded.

16:33.585 --> 16:35.086
You look so happy right now,
Tiffany, I'm being serious.

16:35.087 --> 16:36.654
<i>Dude, you're gonna, like,</i>

16:36.655 --> 16:38.322
<i>sleep with that
tonight or something.</i>

16:38.323 --> 16:39.791
Tiffany cannot
get enough of this pig.

16:39.792 --> 16:40.925
Yeah!

16:40.926 --> 16:42.293
Like in a creepy way.

16:42.294 --> 16:43.795
Like, she
loves this pig.

16:43.796 --> 16:45.863
All right, here we go.

16:45.864 --> 16:47.832
While the
red team gets ready

16:47.833 --> 16:50.635
for their long night
in Hell's Kitchen,

16:50.636 --> 16:51.969
the blue team is out
painting the town.

16:51.970 --> 16:53.971
What's happenin'?

16:53.972 --> 16:55.840
Red.

16:55.841 --> 16:57.241
Mr. Top.
Congratulations on your win.

16:57.242 --> 16:57.909
What do I call you?

16:57.910 --> 16:59.243
You can call me Mr. Top.

16:59.244 --> 17:01.179
Brian was very into Carrot Top.

17:01.180 --> 17:04.115
Come here, you, I'm gonna
give you a kiss on the face.

17:05.384 --> 17:07.251
You know, I make props.
That's what I do.

17:07.252 --> 17:09.287
<i>So I thought of one
just for you guys.</i>

17:09.288 --> 17:10.121
This is a chef hat,
so when he's yellin' at ya...

17:12.057 --> 17:13.991
You can be like,
"I can't... I can't hear it.

17:13.992 --> 17:15.059
I don't know
what you're talking about."

17:15.060 --> 17:16.828
<i>You guys wanna take a picture?</i>

17:16.829 --> 17:18.663
Yeah.

17:18.664 --> 17:20.397
<i>This is the lifestyle
of the rich and famous.</i>

17:20.398 --> 17:22.165
That's my hand on your ass.

17:22.166 --> 17:23.768
Who has it
better than me right now?

17:23.769 --> 17:26.037
I feel like a superstar.

17:26.038 --> 17:27.704
So I'm ready to rock and roll.

17:27.705 --> 17:32.477
I'm talking about
party my ass off.

17:32.478 --> 17:34.178
<i>Can we get girls over here?</i>

17:34.179 --> 17:37.014
<i>Who does this?
Who does this?</i>

17:37.015 --> 17:38.483
<i>Yeah, baby!</i>

17:38.484 --> 17:40.384
<i>Opa!</i>

17:42.000 --> 17:48.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

17:49.294 --> 17:51.662
That is ed up.

17:51.663 --> 17:54.332
There's this big, red
button on the side of the grill.

17:54.333 --> 17:59.837
And, uh, when an hour expires,
there's this horrendous alarm

17:59.838 --> 18:01.072
that goes off
throughout the dorm.

18:02.074 --> 18:04.008
I'm so pissed.

18:04.009 --> 18:05.877
And it will not stop ringing

18:05.878 --> 18:08.279
until one of us
hits that red button,

18:08.280 --> 18:10.014
so that they check the coals,

18:10.015 --> 18:11.482
check the internal
temperature of the pig,

18:11.483 --> 18:12.016
baste it, flip it...

18:12.017 --> 18:13.718
Oh, my God.

18:13.719 --> 18:15.319
And then starts another hour

18:15.320 --> 18:16.821
until, uh,
the alarm goes off again.

18:16.822 --> 18:19.223
I can't believe
they're gonna do this all night.

18:26.365 --> 18:27.698
Hit the button!

18:28.934 --> 18:30.201
<i>I'm tired now.</i>

18:34.473 --> 18:36.440
This is, by far,
the worst punishment

18:36.441 --> 18:39.143
I've had to do
since I've been here.

18:41.180 --> 18:43.080
Does it have to be that loud?

18:43.081 --> 18:45.950
<i>We could be
in Vegas right now.</i>

18:45.951 --> 18:48.186
After being on pig
patrol throughout the night...

18:48.187 --> 18:50.087
<i>About ready?</i>

18:50.088 --> 18:53.257
The red team wakes up to...

18:53.258 --> 18:54.292
More work.

18:54.293 --> 18:55.827
Really tired.

18:55.828 --> 18:57.562
We're really exhausted
from last night,

18:57.563 --> 18:59.697
but we're all
just trying to stay awake.

18:59.698 --> 19:00.698
Tiffany.

19:00.699 --> 19:01.999
Yeah. What up?

19:02.000 --> 19:03.935
Barbie.
I'm good.

19:03.936 --> 19:05.169
Christina, good?

19:05.170 --> 19:07.438
If we just knock out this prep,

19:07.439 --> 19:08.940
we'll be ready
for service tonight.

19:08.941 --> 19:10.541
Blue team's back.

19:10.542 --> 19:13.778
Hello, ladies!

19:13.779 --> 19:15.713
Vegas! Vegas!

19:15.714 --> 19:17.415
Hello, chef Christina.

19:19.184 --> 19:21.385
'Ello.
What is the matter with you?

19:21.386 --> 19:22.386
It's a mask.

19:22.387 --> 19:23.988
, man.

19:23.989 --> 19:25.990
The blue team
is completely energized

19:25.991 --> 19:27.491
by their trip to Vegas.

19:27.492 --> 19:29.594
<i>Make it happen, guys.</i>

19:29.595 --> 19:31.362
Unfortunately,
the team's newest member...

19:31.363 --> 19:32.997
Wow, you guys totally
do everything different.

19:32.998 --> 19:35.099
Is a little confused.

19:35.100 --> 19:37.335
The guys do different
things than the red team,

19:37.336 --> 19:39.370
so, I'm so confused right now.

19:39.371 --> 19:40.771
Are you guys putting whipped
cream in your squeeze bottle?

19:40.772 --> 19:41.572
We don't.

19:41.573 --> 19:43.207
I do it different over there.

19:43.208 --> 19:44.876
I don't like to pour
the whole mix in there.

19:44.877 --> 19:46.277
I don't give a what
they put up on the red team.

19:46.278 --> 19:48.779
You are now blue.
You are no longer red.

19:48.780 --> 19:50.047
We do not have vaginas.

19:50.048 --> 19:51.549
<i>I trust you guys, so...</i>

19:51.550 --> 19:52.984
I'm gonna see how it rolls.

19:52.985 --> 19:54.018
Ladies, let's go.

19:54.019 --> 19:55.086
Yes, chef.

19:55.087 --> 19:56.087
<i>Blue team, line up.</i>

19:56.088 --> 19:57.989
Chef.
Yes, chef.

19:59.992 --> 20:01.993
So I expect this to be
our best service yet.

20:01.994 --> 20:04.061
Yes, chef.
Good.

20:04.062 --> 20:07.765
Tonight, there will be guests,
once again, at our chef tables.

20:07.766 --> 20:09.433
<i>Okay, in the blue kitchen,</i>

20:09.434 --> 20:12.370
on the chef table,
the winner of season nine,

20:12.371 --> 20:16.107
<i>American Idol, Lee DeWyze.</i>

20:16.108 --> 20:19.277
<i>With the season ten finalist,</i>

20:19.278 --> 20:21.846
Haley Reinhart.

20:21.847 --> 20:23.848
<i>Uh, ladies, in the red kitchen,</i>

20:23.849 --> 20:25.816
<i>you'll have one of
the greatest soccer players...</i>

20:25.817 --> 20:27.485
No way.

20:27.486 --> 20:29.255
To ever play the game.

20:30.522 --> 20:32.823
Oh!

20:37.341 --> 20:40.443
After eliminating
a number of the weaker chefs,

20:40.444 --> 20:42.545
chef Ramsay is expecting
tonight's service

20:42.546 --> 20:44.347
to be a good one, so...

20:44.348 --> 20:46.916
Tonight, there will be guests,
once again, at our chef tables.

20:46.917 --> 20:49.218
<i>The blue team will have
American Idol season nine winner...</i>

20:49.219 --> 20:50.820
Lee DeWyze.

20:50.821 --> 20:52.555
And one of the
stars from season ten...

20:52.556 --> 20:54.123
Haley Reinhart.

20:54.124 --> 20:55.925
And the red
team will be hosting...

20:55.926 --> 20:57.126
One of the greatest
soccer players...

20:57.127 --> 20:58.694
No way.

20:58.695 --> 21:00.612
To ever play the game.

21:02.065 --> 21:03.366
You have David Beckham.

21:03.367 --> 21:05.735
Oh!
Oh, my God!

21:05.736 --> 21:07.870
I don't get star-struck.
I truly don't.

21:07.871 --> 21:10.306
But what girl doesn't think
David Beckham is smoking hot?

21:10.307 --> 21:13.476
Even me... I like women,
and I think he's smoking hot.

21:13.477 --> 21:15.144
<i>Let's go.
Get on your sections.</i>

21:15.145 --> 21:16.712
Everything's good?
Yup.

21:16.713 --> 21:17.947
Let's go, ladies! Whoo!

21:17.948 --> 21:19.081
Whoo-whoop.

21:19.082 --> 21:21.551
Let's go. James.
Yes, chef?

21:21.552 --> 21:23.186
<i>Open Hell's Kitchen, please.
Let's go.</i>

21:23.187 --> 21:24.287
Okay.

21:36.867 --> 21:38.834
I'm not that good at cooking,
I'll admit.

21:38.835 --> 21:40.436
For tonight's dinner service,

21:40.437 --> 21:42.705
both teams are excited
to host their VIP guests.

21:42.706 --> 21:44.840
Welcome back, my darling.
Good to see you. Are you good?

21:44.841 --> 21:46.075
You too.
Yes, I'm very well.

21:46.076 --> 21:49.078
<i>Enjoy.
I will.</i>

21:49.079 --> 21:50.813
But in the red kitchen...

21:50.814 --> 21:52.381
<i>There's David Beckham.</i>

21:52.382 --> 21:55.484
Oh, you gotta be me,
dude, he is so hot.

21:55.485 --> 21:58.254
The excitement
is a little overwhelming.

21:58.255 --> 22:01.023
When David Beckham arrives,
I'm just like, "Holy .

22:01.024 --> 22:02.191
Holy .

22:02.192 --> 22:04.527
He rode in on a rainbow,

22:04.528 --> 22:07.163
carried by a unicorn,
eating a cupcake.

22:07.164 --> 22:08.698
He is a magical creature.

22:08.699 --> 22:10.032
Absolute pleasure.
Good to see you.

22:10.033 --> 22:11.267
Thank you very much.

22:11.268 --> 22:12.935
How are you, Brooklyn?
Good to see you. Good.

22:12.936 --> 22:14.103
Uh, Dana, please look after
our guests.

22:14.104 --> 22:15.371
Yes, chef.

22:15.372 --> 22:17.206
Who's gonna be waiting
on David Beckham?

22:17.207 --> 22:18.741
That would be me,
thank you very much.

22:18.742 --> 22:21.077
We have an appetizer special,
which is a pulled pork pizza.

22:21.078 --> 22:22.912
I'll definitely try that.

22:22.913 --> 22:24.947
All right, just give us one
minute, we'll get that for ya.

22:26.049 --> 22:28.651
Chef table first, yes?
Two flatbread.

22:28.652 --> 22:30.286
Yes, chef.

22:30.287 --> 22:32.088
While the
red team gets to work

22:32.089 --> 22:33.189
on a very important
table of appetizers,

22:33.190 --> 22:35.091
in the blue kitchen...

22:35.092 --> 22:36.659
Table one, two scallops.

22:36.660 --> 22:38.094
Straight after, look at me,
chef's table.

22:38.095 --> 22:39.095
<i>Two flatbread.</i>

22:39.096 --> 22:40.896
Yes, chef!

22:40.897 --> 22:42.932
It's up to
Clemenza on the fish station

22:42.933 --> 22:44.634
to get the dinner service
off to a good start.

22:44.635 --> 22:46.736
<i>I got two
scallops coming right now!</i>

22:46.737 --> 22:48.404
I think after yesterday,
we're on a roll.

22:48.405 --> 22:51.374
I'm feeling really confident
at this point in time.

22:53.176 --> 22:55.344
Oh, dear.

22:55.345 --> 22:57.813
Hey. Hey, all of you.
Hey, come here.

22:57.814 --> 22:58.814
<i>Look at the state of that.</i>

22:58.815 --> 23:00.016
Really?

23:00.017 --> 23:01.851
There's still
water now, look.

23:01.852 --> 23:04.487
There's no excuse
to be scallops up

23:04.488 --> 23:06.889
at this point in the game.

23:06.890 --> 23:08.557
Honestly, Clemenza?

23:08.558 --> 23:10.526
Honestly?

23:10.527 --> 23:12.528
Seriously, guys.

23:12.529 --> 23:15.064
I'm getting
really pissed off.

23:15.065 --> 23:17.099
W-w-w-w-w-what the ?

23:17.100 --> 23:18.434
Clemenza,
what's the deal, buddy?

23:18.435 --> 23:19.135
Talk to me!

23:19.136 --> 23:20.436
Scallop in the window.

23:20.437 --> 23:21.437
Coming through.

23:21.438 --> 23:23.606
Two scallop up.

23:26.977 --> 23:28.511
Service, please.

23:28.512 --> 23:31.380
Clemenza
has quickly rebounded

23:31.381 --> 23:33.349
and delivered
acceptable scallops.

23:33.350 --> 23:35.951
And over in the red kitchen,
Dana is hoping to score

23:35.952 --> 23:38.454
with her kitchen's flatbread.

23:38.455 --> 23:39.622
me, dude.

23:39.623 --> 23:41.857
Dana, are you good?

23:41.858 --> 23:44.560
I need you to work me
a new pizza.

23:44.561 --> 23:45.928
I got it. I'll work it,
I'll work it.

23:45.929 --> 23:48.197
No worries. No rush.

23:48.198 --> 23:52.335
David's pizza is this
big, like, mangled mess.

23:52.336 --> 23:53.969
He's sitting right there, like,

23:53.970 --> 23:55.071
what the hell's
going on over there?

23:55.072 --> 23:57.139
Kimmie, I can do this.

23:57.140 --> 23:58.708
Coming behind.

23:58.709 --> 24:00.109
<i>Oh, .</i>

24:00.110 --> 24:01.377
<i>This oven is just...</i>

24:01.378 --> 24:03.112
Not cooperating.

24:03.113 --> 24:04.914
I go over, and I put
the peel in to turn it,

24:04.915 --> 24:06.148
and same thing
happens to me.

24:06.149 --> 24:07.783
I'm like, oh, my God.

24:07.784 --> 24:10.219
. It's stuck.
Let's make another one.

24:12.823 --> 24:14.357
We were fumbling

24:14.358 --> 24:16.559
like we'd never even
been in a kitchen before.

24:16.560 --> 24:18.894
Hungry?
Yes.

24:18.895 --> 24:20.563
<i>Please,
please work this time.</i>

24:20.564 --> 24:22.465
All right, Dana, it's good.

24:22.466 --> 24:23.466
Yay.

24:23.467 --> 24:24.467
Hang this for me, please.

24:24.468 --> 24:25.701
<i>Thank God.</i>

24:25.702 --> 24:26.769
Third time's a charm.

24:26.770 --> 24:29.605
Enjoy it.

24:29.606 --> 24:31.440
It's really good.

24:31.441 --> 24:33.576
With the Beckhams
enjoying their flatbread...

24:33.577 --> 24:34.710
Two flatbread, table 63.
Yes, chef.

24:34.711 --> 24:35.745
Two scallops,
two lobster spaghetti.

24:35.746 --> 24:36.779
<i>How long?</i>

24:36.780 --> 24:38.214
One flatbread coming
right behind, chef.

24:38.215 --> 24:39.815
Service, please.

24:39.816 --> 24:41.484
The red team
tries to stay focused

24:41.485 --> 24:42.685
on the rest of their diners.

24:42.686 --> 24:44.754
Next ticket, ladies.

24:44.755 --> 24:46.655
And over
in the blue kitchen...

24:46.656 --> 24:49.191
An order. Chef's table.
Two flatbread. How long?

24:49.192 --> 24:51.694
If it's not working, get it out.
If it's not working, get it out.

24:51.695 --> 24:54.397
There are more
mystifying flatbread issues.

24:54.398 --> 24:56.732
<i>Get rid of that, man.
Get rid of that.</i>

24:56.733 --> 24:57.666
Get rid of it, it's broken
in 90 Pieces.

24:57.667 --> 24:58.968
What happened to that?

24:58.969 --> 25:00.803
It broke, chef.
We broke a pizza?

25:00.804 --> 25:02.004
Oh, come on.

25:02.005 --> 25:04.240
Uh...

25:04.241 --> 25:05.441
Not good.

25:05.442 --> 25:07.309
It's just like
you've all given up.

25:07.310 --> 25:09.078
That's gonna stick in there.
Look at the rips.

25:09.079 --> 25:10.846
<i>It's gonna stick in there.
More dough. Ugh...</i>

25:10.847 --> 25:12.748
This is my first night
cooking with the blue team...

25:12.749 --> 25:14.124
Do you want me to help you do
the flatbreads?

25:14.125 --> 25:14.984
Watch that pizza.

25:14.985 --> 25:16.652
And the ship
is definitely sinking.

25:16.653 --> 25:18.587
<i>But I am not going down.</i>

25:18.588 --> 25:21.791
Flatbread working hard, guys!

25:21.792 --> 25:23.125
How long, Robyn?

25:23.126 --> 25:24.126
Flatbread. I'm coating!

25:24.127 --> 25:25.528
Let's go.

25:25.529 --> 25:27.596
Flatbread.

25:30.400 --> 25:32.201
Good.

25:32.202 --> 25:36.205
With Robyn taking the
lead, the VIPs in the blue kitchen

25:36.206 --> 25:38.641
are finally singing the praises
of their flatbread.

25:38.642 --> 25:40.042
It's good.

25:40.043 --> 25:41.777
Meanwhile,
the red team has continued

25:41.778 --> 25:43.279
to push out appetizers.

25:43.280 --> 25:45.014
Service, please.

25:45.015 --> 25:46.816
And all they need
to move on to entrees...

25:46.817 --> 25:48.751
Scallops. How long?
Behind.

25:48.752 --> 25:52.121
Is a perfect order
of scallops from Tiffany.

25:52.122 --> 25:54.256
<i>Tiffany.
Yes, chef.</i>

25:54.257 --> 25:56.525
Those scallops are cooked perfectly.
Thank you, chef.

25:56.526 --> 25:59.128
I've got these scallops down.
I know what's up.

25:59.129 --> 26:01.030
I'm just gonna give myself
a pat on the back.

26:01.031 --> 26:03.332
Good job, Tiffany.

26:03.333 --> 26:04.834
Oh, ladies.

26:04.835 --> 26:06.902
I've never had the appetizers
leave that smoothly.

26:06.903 --> 26:09.038
<i>Keep it going. Let's go.
Yes, chef.</i>

26:09.039 --> 26:11.507
Thanks to
Tiffany's stellar scallops,

26:11.508 --> 26:14.043
all the diners on the red side
have received their appetizers.

26:15.779 --> 26:17.746
Meanwhile,
over in the blue kitchen...

26:17.747 --> 26:19.815
risotto garnish
will be a minute.

26:19.816 --> 26:21.450
A leader is emerging.

26:21.451 --> 26:22.518
Thank you!

26:22.519 --> 26:23.919
Robyn is vocal.

26:23.920 --> 26:27.056
Robyn's calling times,
she's calling orders,

26:27.057 --> 26:28.991
she just impressed
the outta me.

26:28.992 --> 26:30.593
You ready?
I'm walking.

26:30.594 --> 26:31.994
Got it.

26:31.995 --> 26:33.496
risotto.

26:33.497 --> 26:35.130
With Robyn
steering the ship...

26:35.131 --> 26:36.632
<i>Service, please.</i>

26:36.633 --> 26:38.934
The blue team has
finished most of their appetizers.

26:38.935 --> 26:40.102
Three Wellington, two sea bass,
one New York strip. How long?

26:40.103 --> 26:41.670
Wellington walking.

26:41.671 --> 26:43.339
Now, it's
up to Royce on meat

26:43.340 --> 26:46.375
to keep the flow going
on entrees.

26:48.345 --> 26:49.979
Unbelievable.

26:49.980 --> 26:52.481
Hey, all of you.
Come here.

26:52.482 --> 26:54.617
Three different Wellingtons.

26:54.618 --> 26:56.285
Part mid-rare,
part medium,

26:56.286 --> 26:58.354
and that one's
on the medium to medium-well.

26:58.355 --> 27:00.523
And you're expecting me
to put that on the same table?

27:00.524 --> 27:02.758
No, chef.
I'll fix it, chef.

27:02.759 --> 27:04.193
Really, Royce?
Unacceptable.

27:04.194 --> 27:05.427
Sorry. Unacceptable.

27:05.428 --> 27:07.830
<i>Royce.
Yes, chef.</i>

27:07.831 --> 27:09.431
Uh, flip the tickets.

27:09.432 --> 27:11.000
Yes, chef.

27:11.001 --> 27:12.868
Can I go two pork, two New York
strip, one cod. How long?

27:12.869 --> 27:13.869
Four minutes.

27:13.870 --> 27:15.538
Unbelievable.

27:15.539 --> 27:17.740
Royce has no idea
what the 's going on.

27:17.741 --> 27:19.475
He's like a ostrich

27:19.476 --> 27:20.809
with his head
underneath the sand.

27:20.810 --> 27:21.944
Two pork, two New York.
How long, Royce?

27:21.945 --> 27:25.648
The two New Yorks are down,
they got eight minutes.

27:25.649 --> 27:27.583
<i>Are you kidding me, man?</i>

27:27.584 --> 27:29.385
<i>You screwed
the three Wellington.</i>

27:29.386 --> 27:30.352
Yes.
So flip the ticket.

27:30.353 --> 27:31.754
<i>Yes, chef.</i>

27:31.755 --> 27:32.855
<i>You said four minutes.
Yes, chef.</i>

27:32.856 --> 27:33.923
Now you're saying eight.

27:33.924 --> 27:35.758
I need five minutes, chef.

27:35.759 --> 27:37.793
Royce is in a funk.
He's all over the place.

27:37.794 --> 27:40.129
He can't seem
to bounce back.

27:40.130 --> 27:41.697
<i>Royce, how long?</i>

27:41.698 --> 27:42.631
<i>Five minutes, chef.</i>

27:42.632 --> 27:43.899
Still five minutes!

27:43.900 --> 27:45.568
<i>It's just five minutes
every time I look at you!</i>

27:45.569 --> 27:47.636
I just...
You said five minutes ago.

27:47.637 --> 27:49.371
Then four minutes, chef.

27:49.372 --> 27:51.140
Hey, you, come here, you.
Hey, you, you, come here.

27:51.141 --> 27:52.641
<i>You stay there.
Come here, you.</i>

27:52.642 --> 27:54.543
Come here.
All of you come here.

27:54.544 --> 27:56.245
Jeez.

27:56.246 --> 27:58.113
This is not good at all.

27:58.114 --> 28:00.983
<i>I'm burnt out.
I'm done. I've had enough.</i>

28:08.989 --> 28:10.757
An hour into dinner service,

28:10.758 --> 28:12.492
and after several
failed attempts

28:12.493 --> 28:13.993
to get an accurate time
on Royce's meat...

28:13.994 --> 28:15.561
How long, Royce?

28:15.562 --> 28:17.163
The two New Yorks are down.
They got eight minutes.

28:17.164 --> 28:18.698
You said four minutes.

28:18.699 --> 28:20.300
Yes, chef.
Now you're saying eight.

28:20.301 --> 28:22.268
I need five minutes, chef.

28:22.269 --> 28:24.270
Chef Ramsay has
extended a special invitation...

28:24.271 --> 28:26.072
Come here, hey, all of you.
come here.

28:26.073 --> 28:28.141
To the men on the blue team.

28:28.142 --> 28:30.009
I've got Lee and Haley
on the chef table,

28:30.010 --> 28:31.411
and David Beckham
and his son in there.

28:31.412 --> 28:34.280
I don't know what's going on.
It's like you lost it!

28:34.281 --> 28:36.716
Have a meeting here,
get a grip,

28:36.717 --> 28:38.251
and I swear to God,

28:38.252 --> 28:39.819
when you walk back through
that door,

28:39.820 --> 28:41.154
change your attitude,
or off.

28:41.155 --> 28:42.255
Yes, chef.

28:42.256 --> 28:43.756
Get out now, !

28:43.757 --> 28:45.158
Yes, chef.

28:45.159 --> 28:46.826
<i>Let's go, Robyn.</i>

28:46.827 --> 28:48.628
It's only me
left in my kitchen.

28:48.629 --> 28:50.363
I'm like a deer
in headlights, like...

28:50.364 --> 28:51.698
<i>Come on, Robyn.
Let's get the momentum.</i>

28:51.699 --> 28:53.199
Let's keep going.
Come on.

28:53.200 --> 28:54.934
<i>You got two spaghetti
working, yes?</i>

28:54.935 --> 28:57.170
Yes, chef. I got two spaghettis
working right now, chef.

28:57.171 --> 28:59.072
Okay, you got two risotto
started already?

28:59.073 --> 28:59.939
Yes, chef, I got it
right there on the side.

29:02.910 --> 29:05.111
Oh, man, I can't...

29:08.048 --> 29:10.016
So, boys, please
take a couple deep breaths

29:10.017 --> 29:11.584
and get your ass
back in here now.

29:11.585 --> 29:13.386
<i>Then get the two risotto ready
as well, too.</i>

29:13.387 --> 29:15.121
Yes... Chef.

29:15.122 --> 29:17.457
While Robyn is
forced into a solo performance,

29:17.458 --> 29:20.193
the idols and the rest of
the diners on the blue side,

29:20.194 --> 29:21.794
continue to wait for food.

29:21.795 --> 29:23.529
Good thing they have bread.

29:23.530 --> 29:25.131
Yeah.

29:25.132 --> 29:26.499
But over
in the red kitchen...

29:26.500 --> 29:27.567
Service, please.

29:27.568 --> 29:29.535
The women have served
over half their entrees.

29:29.536 --> 29:31.404
I love the Wellington.

29:31.405 --> 29:33.373
And chef Ramsay is
hoping that Barbie on meat...

29:33.374 --> 29:34.707
Coming down behind!

29:34.708 --> 29:36.042
And Tiffany on fish...

29:36.043 --> 29:37.477
Coming up with the fish.

29:37.478 --> 29:38.611
You have the garnish
for sea bass?

29:38.612 --> 29:40.013
Yup. Right here,
behind you.

29:40.014 --> 29:42.415
Continue to deliver
perfectly-cooked food.

29:42.416 --> 29:44.283
Sea bass?
That's a cod.

29:44.284 --> 29:45.885
That was actually ordered.

29:45.886 --> 29:47.687
Hey, all of you, come here.

29:47.688 --> 29:49.822
I asked for three pork,
three Wellington, one sea bass.

29:49.823 --> 29:52.959
I get three pork,
two Wellington, and one cod.

29:52.960 --> 29:54.093
Oh, .

29:54.094 --> 29:56.662
Oh, .

29:56.663 --> 29:59.932
I had five perfectly-cooked
pieces of meat on that order.

29:59.933 --> 30:02.035
How could you not
know the difference

30:02.036 --> 30:04.137
between the cod
and the sea bass?

30:04.138 --> 30:05.972
Come on, what are you doing?

30:05.973 --> 30:07.673
Hey, Tiffany.
Yes, chef.

30:07.674 --> 30:10.410
<i>Get the sea bass in!
Yes, chef.</i>

30:10.411 --> 30:14.113
I got it, I got it.
Don't worry about it.

30:14.114 --> 30:15.815
That's a cod!

30:15.816 --> 30:17.717
<i>That's a cod, that's a cod!</i>

30:17.718 --> 30:18.918
Well, what's that, then?
Isn't that sea bass?

30:18.919 --> 30:20.520
Whoops.

30:20.521 --> 30:22.088
Your mind must be
somewhere else

30:22.089 --> 30:23.890
<i>if you're mistaken twice.</i>

30:23.891 --> 30:25.525
<i>Cod for sea bass.</i>

30:25.526 --> 30:28.027
And do you know what it hurts?
A great start.

30:28.028 --> 30:29.695
Yes, chef. Sorry, chef.

30:29.696 --> 30:31.731
Okay, yeah, so, my fish
up the whole order.

30:31.732 --> 30:33.433
Well, but you know what?
I'll put another one on.

30:33.434 --> 30:35.535
It'll be done
in three minutes, okay?

30:35.536 --> 30:38.171
Hot, chef.

30:38.172 --> 30:40.773
me. Finally.

30:40.774 --> 30:42.775
The red team
has managed to recover

30:42.776 --> 30:44.844
from Tiffany's
fish mix-up.

30:44.845 --> 30:46.345
<i>Service, please.</i>

30:46.346 --> 30:47.580
And over in the blue kitchen...

30:47.581 --> 30:48.948
Two pork walking.

30:48.949 --> 30:50.383
The men are back.

30:50.384 --> 30:52.085
And Royce on meat,
and Clemenza on fish...

30:52.086 --> 30:53.886
Comin' through.

30:53.887 --> 30:55.555
Are ready to prove
that chef Ramsay's pep talk

30:55.556 --> 30:59.358
did not fall on deaf ears.

30:59.359 --> 31:02.528
The is that?

31:02.529 --> 31:05.832
All of you, come on.

31:05.833 --> 31:08.401
Hey, psst, come here.

31:08.402 --> 31:11.104
I am so pissed off.

31:11.105 --> 31:12.138
<i>Royce...</i>

31:12.139 --> 31:14.240
Look.
It's like a doorstop.

31:14.241 --> 31:15.741
It'll take them
all year to eat that.

31:15.742 --> 31:16.809
Look how dry that is.

31:16.810 --> 31:18.911
It's dry as .

31:18.912 --> 31:21.314
Even squeezing it,
I can't get juice out of it.

31:21.315 --> 31:22.648
I'm sorry.

31:22.649 --> 31:24.617
Royce works at a steakhouse.

31:24.618 --> 31:26.419
He should really be able
to pump these meats out.

31:26.420 --> 31:28.554
And I mean, I'm really
losing it at this point.

31:28.555 --> 31:31.724
<i>I'll fix it, chef.
Hey, hold on, it gets worse.</i>

31:31.725 --> 31:34.460
<i>Clemenza, look at it.
It's burnt!</i>

31:34.461 --> 31:37.396
Look at the state of that.
Look at the color of it.

31:37.397 --> 31:40.032
Clemenza just can't
get the hang of it.

31:40.033 --> 31:42.001
He's just so confused and lost

31:42.002 --> 31:43.603
and stuck and checked-out,

31:43.604 --> 31:44.737
it's a nightmare.

31:44.738 --> 31:45.838
Hey, you. Hey, look.

31:45.839 --> 31:47.607
<i>You look like a slob.</i>

31:47.608 --> 31:51.644
Your jacket's all undone,
you're cooking like a donkey.

31:51.645 --> 31:52.979
It's just... look at me.

31:52.980 --> 31:54.981
Ready to go home?
No way, chef.

31:54.982 --> 31:56.883
Get a grip!
Yes, chef.

31:56.884 --> 31:59.185
While Clemenza's
cod and Royce's pork chops

31:59.186 --> 32:01.587
failed to make the grade,
over in the red kitchen...

32:01.588 --> 32:02.788
I got pork chops, chef.

32:02.789 --> 32:04.423
Walking with the meatballs.

32:04.424 --> 32:06.692
Barbie and Kimmie
are hoping their entrees

32:06.693 --> 32:08.494
will score high marks
with David Beckham.

32:08.495 --> 32:09.962
Dana, serve chef table
please, yes?

32:09.963 --> 32:11.731
Yes, chef.

32:11.732 --> 32:13.099
Ooh.
Here we go.

32:13.100 --> 32:15.034
All right.
Meatballs and spaghetti.

32:15.035 --> 32:16.636
<i>Wow.
Thank you.</i>

32:16.637 --> 32:17.136
<i>And the pork chop.</i>

32:17.137 --> 32:18.704
Thank you.

32:24.711 --> 32:26.812
It's really good.

32:26.813 --> 32:29.282
David Beckham
liked my pork chop.

32:29.283 --> 32:32.084
I made that pork chop.

32:32.085 --> 32:34.787
I'm cooking meat.
I'm in my element again.

32:34.788 --> 32:36.022
I'm doing it right.

32:36.023 --> 32:37.957
Here's your pork, chef.

32:39.560 --> 32:42.061
The pork and the Wellington
were cooked perfectly.

32:42.062 --> 32:43.462
<i>Thank you, chef.
Keep it going.</i>

32:43.463 --> 32:44.697
Yes, chef.

32:44.698 --> 32:46.933
Thanks to
Barbie's perfect run on meat,

32:46.934 --> 32:49.168
the women are nearly finished
with their entrees.

32:49.169 --> 32:51.137
Guys, we're almost there.
Two more tickets.

32:51.138 --> 32:53.372
But over
in the blue kitchen...

32:53.373 --> 32:55.641
I want two pork,
two New York strip.

32:55.642 --> 32:56.842
Yes, chef.

32:56.843 --> 32:58.711
It's a completely
different story,

32:58.712 --> 33:00.680
as they are still
attempting to serve

33:00.681 --> 33:02.281
their first table of entrees.

33:02.282 --> 33:03.382
Two New York strip,
two pork chop.

33:03.383 --> 33:04.951
Ten minutes, chef.

33:04.952 --> 33:07.453
Ten minutes.

33:07.454 --> 33:10.489
Oh, .

33:10.490 --> 33:11.958
Ten minutes.

33:11.959 --> 33:13.559
Chef Ramsay wasn't
happy about that.

33:13.560 --> 33:16.462
Honestly, I don't know
where to go.

33:16.463 --> 33:17.530
Sorry, chef.

33:17.531 --> 33:19.131
Blue team.

33:19.132 --> 33:20.933
Clusterin five...

33:20.934 --> 33:22.301
Hey, look at me.
Hey, stop there, look at me.

33:22.302 --> 33:23.302
Four...

33:23.303 --> 33:24.537
Stop. All of you.

33:24.538 --> 33:25.705
Three...

33:25.706 --> 33:27.473
Honestly, I swear to God...
Two...

33:27.474 --> 33:28.841
I'm seriously...
One.

33:28.842 --> 33:30.876
You, you, you, you...

33:38.405 --> 33:40.473
Two hours into dinner service,

33:40.474 --> 33:42.975
the blue team has still
not served a single entree,

33:42.976 --> 33:45.812
and chef Ramsay knows
he has to do something drastic.

33:45.813 --> 33:47.313
<i>Hey, look at me.</i>

33:47.314 --> 33:48.047
Hey, stop there.
Look at me.

33:48.048 --> 33:49.148
Stop, all of you.

33:49.149 --> 33:50.883
Come here.
Look at you. Come here.

33:50.884 --> 33:53.519
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8,

33:53.520 --> 33:54.787
9, 10, 11 tables.

33:54.788 --> 33:56.189
Come here.

33:57.658 --> 33:59.592
<i>None.</i>

33:59.593 --> 34:01.127
We look at the women's side,

34:01.128 --> 34:03.062
and they completed
their service.

34:05.199 --> 34:06.999
You, you, you, you,
you, come here.

34:07.000 --> 34:09.202
<i>Dana, serve dessert.</i>

34:09.203 --> 34:12.438
I am embarrassed that the red
team has to come help us.

34:12.438 --> 34:14.172
Hey, blue team!
We're manning up,

34:14.174 --> 34:15.775
and we're gonna double
up on the stations

34:15.775 --> 34:17.243
to get this machine going,
let's go!

34:17.244 --> 34:19.344
How long on a sea bass,
pork chop?

34:19.346 --> 34:21.112
The blue team are pathetic.

34:21.114 --> 34:23.482
The whole blue kitchen
was in disarray.

34:23.483 --> 34:25.784
It's just three, just three.
I already got one order here.

34:25.786 --> 34:27.587
<i>Come on, come on,
Brian, don't waste food.</i>

34:27.588 --> 34:29.621
There was nothing
organized and together.

34:29.623 --> 34:31.958
Clearly, they have a problem
cooking and communicating.

34:31.958 --> 34:33.793
You're not counting orders.
You're not counting orders.

34:33.793 --> 34:35.661
<i>Listen, you really gonna
argue with him right now, huh?</i>

34:35.661 --> 34:38.197
No, I'm helping.
I'm trying to help him.

34:38.197 --> 34:40.166
Tiffany talks to me like she's
up here, and I'm down here.

34:40.167 --> 34:41.300
Do me a favor, though.

34:41.301 --> 34:42.668
Don't... don't do that. Okay?

34:42.668 --> 34:44.103
Stop. Stop.
'Cause you know what?

34:44.103 --> 34:45.471
<i>This is why you guys
get up.</i>

34:45.472 --> 34:47.005
Whoa, whoa. Concentrate.
Talk about the orders.

34:47.007 --> 34:49.041
Don't tell us what we do wrong.
Stop, stop, stop.

34:49.042 --> 34:54.614
It took every bit of everything
that I have inside me

34:54.614 --> 34:57.516
not to turn around and shove
her head into the fryer.

34:57.517 --> 34:59.452
I'm not talking.
I'm just cooking. It's all good.

34:59.453 --> 35:02.722
You guys are really
freaking out.

35:02.723 --> 35:04.724
We're here to help,
not make it worse for 'em.

35:04.725 --> 35:06.626
It's not the time
or the place to fight.

35:06.627 --> 35:08.694
We're here to help out
the blue kitchen,

35:08.695 --> 35:10.396
and I'm just trying
to organize, like,

35:10.397 --> 35:11.697
so we can get
some of this food out.

35:11.698 --> 35:13.766
After two pork, two strip,

35:13.767 --> 35:16.736
I got a strip
and sea bass, VIP!

35:16.737 --> 35:18.638
With Christina
leading the way...

35:18.639 --> 35:20.006
Follow me with
that sauce, Royce.

35:20.007 --> 35:21.641
One strip,
sauce is behind me, chef.

35:21.642 --> 35:24.043
The red team
takes control of the entrees.

35:24.044 --> 35:25.378
And all of the diners...

35:25.379 --> 35:27.046
And that rib...
That is so good.

35:27.047 --> 35:30.449
And the VIPs
are finally served.

35:31.618 --> 35:33.552
This is really good.
It's my favorite.

35:33.553 --> 35:34.720
Ladies, clean up, please.

35:34.721 --> 35:35.554
Yes, chef.

35:35.555 --> 35:38.591
Yeah! Clean up!

35:38.592 --> 35:40.293
All right, ladies,
come here quickly.

35:40.294 --> 35:41.928
<i>Yes, chef.</i>

35:41.929 --> 35:43.629
That's one of the best services
you've ever had.

35:43.630 --> 35:44.230
Thank you, chef.
Really good job.

35:44.231 --> 35:45.965
And, clearly, you won.

35:45.966 --> 35:47.133
Well done. Good job.

35:47.134 --> 35:48.768
Thank you, chef.

35:48.769 --> 35:51.437
Good job. Way to just
be present at the table.

35:51.438 --> 35:53.039
Yeah, we deserved to win.

35:53.040 --> 35:54.840
You know, I'm feeling great,

35:54.841 --> 35:56.375
not having to put somebody
up for elimination.

35:56.376 --> 35:58.077
I feel really good about that.

35:58.078 --> 35:59.645
All right, guys, come here.
Yes, chef.

35:59.646 --> 36:00.880
Come here, come here.

36:00.881 --> 36:03.082
How do I say this?

36:03.083 --> 36:05.518
The only person
who did well on the men's team

36:05.519 --> 36:08.321
was a woman.

36:08.322 --> 36:10.556
Honestly? Seriously?
Royce?

36:10.557 --> 36:12.625
<i>Overcooked pork.</i>

36:12.626 --> 36:14.593
Brian, flatbreads.

36:14.594 --> 36:15.962
You were screwed
before you even started.

36:15.963 --> 36:17.496
<i>Clemenza,</i>

36:17.497 --> 36:21.801
watching you cook tonight
was watching a car crash.

36:21.802 --> 36:24.670
The women in the red team
blew you away.

36:24.671 --> 36:26.405
<i>Go up to the dorms.</i>

36:26.406 --> 36:28.274
Come back to me with two
individuals up for elimination.

36:28.275 --> 36:30.042
<i>Get out of here.</i>

36:30.043 --> 36:32.378
<i>You're... now.
Get out of here.</i>

36:32.379 --> 36:34.213
Oh, man, chef Ramsay

36:34.214 --> 36:37.383
pretty much
obliterated our souls.

36:37.384 --> 36:40.152
I'll start.

36:40.153 --> 36:41.721
I-I have to put up Royce
for the issues

36:41.722 --> 36:44.991
<i>with the pork and the beef,</i>

36:44.992 --> 36:46.525
um, and then I have to
put up Clemenza

36:46.526 --> 36:48.461
for the issues with scallops.

36:48.462 --> 36:50.730
Seriously, nothing against any
of ya, but I'm in' angry.

36:50.731 --> 36:52.365
Yeah, I ed up two
or three orders of scallops.

36:52.366 --> 36:53.766
Whoopdie--doo.

36:53.767 --> 36:55.167
See my ass cheeks?

36:55.168 --> 36:56.769
I don't give a flying .

36:56.770 --> 36:58.337
I got a lot of drive left in me,
and I ain't going anywhere.

36:58.338 --> 36:59.805
I don't think
I deserve to go home.

36:59.806 --> 37:01.841
I gotta say Royce and Brian.

37:01.842 --> 37:03.509
I had scallops come back,

37:03.510 --> 37:05.277
but I basically bailed out
that entire flatbread.

37:05.278 --> 37:07.013
I said you came over
and . Yeah.

37:07.014 --> 37:08.214
I had three issues.

37:08.215 --> 37:09.882
<i>So, out of that,</i>

37:09.883 --> 37:14.420
to me, versus a ton
of scallops and flatbreads

37:14.421 --> 37:17.556
<i>that we couldn't even get out
to even get appetizers out,</i>

37:17.557 --> 37:20.526
so that's why I'm putting up
Brian and Clemenza.

37:20.527 --> 37:22.194
<i>I'm not the weakest link.</i>

37:22.195 --> 37:23.863
We know this.
Everybody knows this.

37:23.864 --> 37:26.365
Gordon Ramsay knows this.
So, it's like .

37:26.366 --> 37:28.901
My decision's
really hard to make

37:28.902 --> 37:31.537
because it's my first day here,
you know what I'm saying?

37:31.538 --> 37:34.673
So, I don't know.

37:34.674 --> 37:36.208
<i>You gotta put
at least one up, Robyn.</i>

37:36.209 --> 37:38.277
This sucks.

37:38.278 --> 37:40.046
You know what I'm saying?
I hate doing this .

37:40.047 --> 37:41.180
<i>Go, Robyn.</i>

37:41.181 --> 37:42.982
Make a decision.

37:42.983 --> 37:45.184
<i>You don't have a choice.
You gotta make a call.</i>

37:45.185 --> 37:47.219
Make a decision.
Be decisive.

37:47.220 --> 37:49.655
Robyn, you gotta do it.

37:49.656 --> 37:51.090
I'm too...

37:51.091 --> 37:52.258
<i>Brian and Royce.</i>

37:52.259 --> 37:53.392
<i>I tie it up.</i>

37:53.393 --> 37:55.828
<i>So, why don't we have</i>

37:55.829 --> 37:57.596
chef make the decision?

37:57.597 --> 37:59.732
No. No way.
Okay.

37:59.733 --> 38:01.934
I think tonight's gonna be
the crazst night,

38:01.935 --> 38:04.236
and the most emotional,
craziest night we've ever seen.

38:04.237 --> 38:08.040
<i>And anybody here's
got a shot at going home.</i>

38:18.685 --> 38:19.819
Ladies, well done.

38:19.820 --> 38:20.886
Thank you, chef.

38:20.887 --> 38:22.555
Robyn.
Yes, chef.

38:22.556 --> 38:24.890
First nominee for the blue team,
and why, please.

38:24.891 --> 38:27.093
Uh, first nominee...

38:27.094 --> 38:28.094
was Royce.

38:28.095 --> 38:30.596
Royce.

38:30.597 --> 38:34.500
Royce...
he let the team down.

38:34.501 --> 38:36.001
Second nominee and why.

38:43.878 --> 38:46.279
After a
disappointing dinner service

38:46.280 --> 38:48.715
where the blue team had to be
bailed out by the red team,

38:48.716 --> 38:49.949
they have nominated...

38:49.950 --> 38:51.985
Royce.
He let the team down.

38:51.986 --> 38:54.287
And now must give
chef Ramsay their second choice.

38:54.288 --> 38:56.556
The second nominee was...

38:56.557 --> 38:58.424
Clemenza.

38:58.425 --> 38:59.592
<i>Clemenza.
Yes, chef.</i>

38:59.593 --> 39:01.594
'Cause of the scallops.

39:01.595 --> 39:04.464
Royce, Clemenza, step forward.

39:06.801 --> 39:08.968
Royce.
Yes, chef.

39:08.969 --> 39:10.904
Why do you think you should
stay in Hell's Kitchen?

39:10.905 --> 39:11.738
I beat myself up
for my mistakes,

39:11.739 --> 39:12.438
and I keep coming back.

39:12.439 --> 39:13.573
Who beat you up?

39:13.574 --> 39:15.008
No, no, I mean physically.

39:15.009 --> 39:17.343
I beat myself up
for my mistakes.

39:20.714 --> 39:22.816
And I walk prouder every day
in here and try to do better.

39:22.817 --> 39:25.652
<i>And I keep trying to do better</i>

39:25.653 --> 39:27.854
and get to that level
of perfection that you want.

39:27.855 --> 39:28.922
I'm opening Gordon Ramsay's
Steak this year. Yeah?

39:28.923 --> 39:33.226
Not in 2025.

39:33.227 --> 39:34.460
Clemenza.

39:34.461 --> 39:36.062
Look at the state of you.

39:36.063 --> 39:37.697
<i>There's more food
on your jacket</i>

39:37.698 --> 39:41.601
<i>than what you served
tonight on plates.</i>

39:41.602 --> 39:43.803
Why do you think you should
stay in Hell's Kitchen?

39:43.804 --> 39:45.638
Chef, I've been on the top
of almost every challenge.

39:45.639 --> 39:47.273
<i>I can cook,
I do have the passion.</i>

39:47.274 --> 39:48.708
I do have the hunger for it.

39:48.709 --> 39:50.276
<i>For some reason, tonight,</i>

39:50.277 --> 39:51.811
I just had a mind
on scallops.

39:51.812 --> 39:54.414
Big boy, I think you're done.

39:54.415 --> 39:57.050
No way, chef.

39:58.385 --> 40:01.454
My decision is...

40:05.092 --> 40:08.661
Clemenza, Royce, both of you
give me your jackets.

40:08.662 --> 40:11.731
<i>Let's go, Royce.
Oh, my God.</i>

40:11.732 --> 40:13.166
<i>Royce...</i>

40:13.167 --> 40:14.701
Yes, chef.
Gimme that jacket.

40:14.702 --> 40:17.303
Your time is done.

40:17.304 --> 40:20.707
<i>Give my regards to Ralph.
Get out of here.</i>

40:29.149 --> 40:31.150
Of course I'm
not okay with leaving.

40:31.151 --> 40:32.952
I know I'm better
than everybody else.

40:32.953 --> 40:36.122
I came here driven, focused,
I pushed myself.

40:36.123 --> 40:38.191
I don't think I deserve
to be standing here.

40:38.192 --> 40:39.259
<i>Clemenza,</i>

40:39.260 --> 40:40.927
gimme your jacket.

40:40.928 --> 40:44.731
<i>You are really disappointing.</i>

40:44.732 --> 40:46.466
<i>I expected so much more.</i>

40:46.467 --> 40:47.634
I know you did, chef.

40:47.635 --> 40:49.002
<i>And bigger than that,</i>

40:49.003 --> 40:50.670
you're a filthy mess.

40:50.671 --> 40:52.005
Get a clean jacket on,

40:52.006 --> 40:53.106
<i>and get back in line.</i>

40:53.107 --> 40:57.343
Yeah, safe. Yeah, safe.

41:01.448 --> 41:03.716
<i>Clemenza.
Yes, chef.</i>

41:03.717 --> 41:05.485
Try to stay clean.

41:05.486 --> 41:07.654
<i>I will, chef.
Just for one service.</i>

41:07.655 --> 41:10.990
You're like a pig rolling around
in all day long.

41:10.991 --> 41:12.525
Yes, chef.

41:12.526 --> 41:14.527
All of you.
Take a look around.

41:14.528 --> 41:16.462
<i>We started off with 18.</i>

41:16.463 --> 41:17.797
We're now down to 9.

41:17.798 --> 41:19.065
Good night.

41:19.066 --> 41:21.134
Good night, chef.

41:21.135 --> 41:23.803
I thought I was done.
I really thought I was done.

41:23.804 --> 41:25.138
I'm glad to be here.

41:25.139 --> 41:26.673
You know, I'm literally...

41:26.674 --> 41:28.308
I'm glad I got the
second chance.

41:28.309 --> 41:29.842
And there's not gonna be
a third chance.

41:29.843 --> 41:32.879
This is it. Do or die.
It's make or break.

41:32.880 --> 41:34.514
We're down at, like, 50%.

41:34.515 --> 41:36.149
I can't believe it.

41:36.150 --> 41:38.484
Like, it's eight people that
I have to work harder than.

41:38.485 --> 41:40.486
I need to carry
my confidence with me

41:40.487 --> 41:42.488
and just
make it happen.

41:42.489 --> 41:45.825
Royce came in promising
a Rolls-Royce service.

41:45.826 --> 41:48.695
But instead, his service
was like a broken-down car.

41:48.696 --> 41:51.431
Time to send Royce
to the junkyard.
