00:01.084 --> 00:03.121
[Tom] Previously on Designated Survivor...

00:03.253 --> 00:06.541
Warehouse burns down,
dead body turns up, you're there.

00:06.673 --> 00:09.381
Whatever you're mixed up in,
your hands better be clean.

00:09.510 --> 00:12.047
[Kendra] The account in St. Lucia
in your name

00:12.179 --> 00:13.761
that Eric Little opened is damning.

00:13.889 --> 00:16.129
Unless Hannah Wells
can find the banker who set it up,

00:16.265 --> 00:17.643
we cannot clear you.

00:17.768 --> 00:20.135
If Lang confesses that
he was working at Lloyd's behest

00:20.270 --> 00:22.978
to make it look like the First Lady
was getting a payola from Icarus,

00:23.106 --> 00:24.062
we can clear her name.

00:24.191 --> 00:26.853
I'm gonna hit the loo.
See you in a second.

00:28.111 --> 00:29.067
Mr. Lang.

00:29.196 --> 00:30.231
We just missed him.

00:30.364 --> 00:31.729
Someone tipped him off.

00:31.865 --> 00:33.606
You need to fire Foerstel.

00:33.742 --> 00:35.949
He's doing his job.
Maybe not the way we want him to,

00:36.078 --> 00:38.410
but I can't fire him for that.
If I did, who would I be?

00:38.539 --> 00:39.825
My husband.

00:39.957 --> 00:42.494
| ran Lang's cell phone.
You were right.

00:42.626 --> 00:45.084
Somebody called him
right before you got to his condo.

00:45.629 --> 00:47.336
Call came from 4th and H.

00:47.464 --> 00:49.956
I'm gonna hit the loo.
I'll meet you there.

00:51.093 --> 00:53.209
[snoring softly]

01:21.540 --> 01:22.951
[grunts]

01:27.796 --> 01:29.878
Hannah, where did you go?

01:43.186 --> 01:44.312
What are you doing?

01:44.438 --> 01:46.099
| was just gonna get some water.

01:46.690 --> 01:48.931
[exhales] I could use some myself.

01:49.067 --> 01:51.024
Too much red wine.

01:51.153 --> 01:53.895
You don't have to get me drunk
to take advantage of me.

01:54.031 --> 01:57.194
Oh, you just can't handle
your alcohol, sport.

01:57.326 --> 01:58.816
I'll get you some aspirin.

01:58.952 --> 01:59.908
Wait.

02:01.580 --> 02:03.742
| know a better hangover cure.

02:03.874 --> 02:06.286
[grunts and breathes heavily]

02:11.965 --> 02:16.755
With dozens dead, billions in damage
and more than one million acres consumed,

02:16.887 --> 02:21.347
the Shenandoah national forest fire's now
one of the worst in American history.

02:21.475 --> 02:24.684
After weeks of battle, the question now is

02:24.811 --> 02:27.519
whether the government
will finally throw in the towel.

02:28.315 --> 02:31.603
No, the question now is whether doing so
will look like abject surrender.

02:31.735 --> 02:32.896
It's an act of God, Lyor.

02:33.028 --> 02:36.396
To most voters, the president is God.
God should be able to put out a fire.

02:36.531 --> 02:39.398
This fire's lasted 26 days
and we've barely made a dent.

02:39.534 --> 02:41.992
Seth, how would you make
this announcement?

02:42.120 --> 02:45.658
| can have public engagement get quotes
from leading conservation experts

02:45.791 --> 02:48.249
saying that letting the fire burn
is ecologically sound.

02:50.253 --> 02:53.245
Okay, we're done,
we're gonna let this burn itself out.

02:53.382 --> 02:55.043
-Prepare the statement.
-Yes, sir.

02:57.344 --> 03:00.302
Aaron, we're about to announce
that we're pulling back.

03:00.430 --> 03:02.387
Have we managed to get everybody
out of harm's way?

03:02.516 --> 03:03.677
95% of it, sir.

03:03.809 --> 03:08.303
National Park Service's going door-to-door
to clear the remaining holdouts.

03:08.438 --> 03:10.475
I'll monitor the situation closely.

03:10.607 --> 03:14.475
Okay, thank you for your hard work.
Finish up there and get back home.

03:14.611 --> 03:16.943
-As soon as I can, sir.
-Okay.

03:20.909 --> 03:22.024
[sighs]

03:22.160 --> 03:24.777
[man talking indistinctly on radio]

03:27.124 --> 03:29.411
[helicopter hovering]

03:30.544 --> 03:32.410
[siren wailing]

03:35.632 --> 03:37.339
Sir, we need you to evacuate now.

03:37.467 --> 03:38.844
We're on a religious retreat.

03:38.969 --> 03:40.050
| appreciate that,

03:40.178 --> 03:43.170
but a command decision's been made
to let this fire burn itself out.

03:43.306 --> 03:45.684
-How many are you?
-Twenty of us.

03:45.809 --> 03:46.844
We can bring you down.

03:46.977 --> 03:48.934
No, thanks.
We have our own transportation.

03:49.062 --> 03:51.645
Then get moving.
Fire jumps that ridge, you're out of time.

03:52.274 --> 03:54.106
Understood. Thank you, sir.

04:06.163 --> 04:07.369
You know what to do.

04:10.792 --> 04:12.624
[indistinct chatter]

04:15.589 --> 04:18.206
They call themselves the Church
of the Witnesses of the Covenant.

04:18.341 --> 04:19.331
It's a Christianity offshoot.

04:19.468 --> 04:21.334
-A cult?
-Uh... evidence is to the contrary.

04:21.470 --> 04:23.302
Few hundred members, taxpayers.

04:23.430 --> 04:25.046
No legal problems, solid citizens.

04:25.182 --> 04:27.799
If they're trying to barbecue themselves,
they're a cult.

04:27.934 --> 04:29.220
You're an atheist, Lyor.

04:29.352 --> 04:31.343
You think anyone who's God-fearing
is loony.

04:31.480 --> 04:33.892
I'm actually agnostic, but I'll tell you
what I do believe:

04:34.024 --> 04:37.562
letting 20 folks burn on federal land
during Christmas

04:37.694 --> 04:39.401
-is bad political mojo.
-[sighs]

04:39.529 --> 04:40.690
Also, the 20 people.

04:40.822 --> 04:43.029
-How long's he been in there, Mike?
-Fifteen minutes.

04:43.158 --> 04:45.490
-[indistinct chatter]
-[Emily] These usually last 30 minutes.

04:45.619 --> 04:46.700
This one will go longer.

04:46.828 --> 04:49.206
He's getting every vet's
detailed deployment history.

04:49.331 --> 04:50.412
[Emily] We have to clear the decks.

04:50.540 --> 04:53.248
[girls singing]
s God rest ye merry gentlemen

04:53.376 --> 04:55.413
-Oh, boy.
-4 Let nothing you dismay J

04:55.545 --> 04:57.752
-Sorry, girls. We'll find you later.
-[girls] Aw...

05:01.051 --> 05:03.008
-You wanna pull him out?
-[sighs] Not particularly.

05:03.136 --> 05:04.217
You're the Chief of Staff.

05:04.346 --> 05:06.462
You're right.
I'm ordering you to pull him out.

05:07.516 --> 05:09.427
-[indistinct chatter]
-Ten-hut!

05:09.559 --> 05:11.266
Secretary Pilson, what have you got?

05:11.394 --> 05:13.601
Fire's crested Blackrock Gap.

05:13.730 --> 05:16.939
Which means another 300,000 acres
are as good as lost.

05:17.067 --> 05:19.274
How long till it gets down
to the bottom of the valley?

05:19.402 --> 05:21.018
An hour, tops.

05:21.154 --> 05:23.896
Unless the Forest Service continues
to deploy its assets.

05:24.032 --> 05:26.569
But we're talking about putting
hundreds of people in harm's way.

05:26.701 --> 05:30.239
To save 20 who can leave but won't.
It's not a great calculus, sir.

05:30.372 --> 05:33.364
[Tom] Either for the firefighters
or the churchgoers holed up in that cabin.

05:33.500 --> 05:36.288
Are we absolutely positive
this isn't a hostage situation?

05:36.419 --> 05:37.796
Doesn't appear so, sir.

05:37.921 --> 05:41.380
The group's spokesperson is their deacon,
David Sheridan.

05:41.508 --> 05:43.215
He says he'll only speak to the White House.

05:43.343 --> 05:45.459
What leverage has he got to demand that?

05:45.595 --> 05:48.178
The leverage of knowing that
I'm not gonna let 20 people die

05:48.306 --> 05:50.889
just 'cause I wouldn't talk to them.

05:51.017 --> 05:52.473
| don't think I have a choice.

05:52.602 --> 05:55.594
Mr. President, I don't want you involved
in this. We need an emissary.

05:56.606 --> 05:59.940
You're right. Aaron's already in the field.
Let's see if he can talk 'em down.

06:05.448 --> 06:07.985
[Aaron] Mr. Sheridan, if you wanna talk,
we'll listen.

06:08.118 --> 06:10.450
But this conversation needs to happen
away from here.

06:10.579 --> 06:16.074
We're not afraid, Mr. Shore, but you
obviously are, so I'll get right to the point.

06:16.209 --> 06:17.825
-Grace Morgan.
- I don't know who that is.

06:17.961 --> 06:20.794
Our parishioner Carrie Morgan's
six-month-old baby girl

06:21.464 --> 06:24.593
in custody of the federal government.

06:24.718 --> 06:26.083
-For what?
-Medical treatment.

06:26.219 --> 06:28.460
Grace has a rare
congenital heart condition.

06:29.264 --> 06:32.302
And the medical intervention
that the doctors recommend,

06:33.310 --> 06:34.516
it goes against Scripture.

06:35.437 --> 06:37.223
You're refusing
to let her have the surgery?

06:37.355 --> 06:38.470
No, sir.

06:39.107 --> 06:41.474
We're insisting on honoring God's word.

06:42.611 --> 06:45.353
-Where is Grace right now?
-At Walter Reed.

06:45.488 --> 06:48.981
And as soon as the government releases her
to the custody of her mother,

06:49.117 --> 06:50.699
we will come down off this mountain.

06:50.827 --> 06:54.616
| have a bus waiting for anyone
who wishes to be transported to safety now.

06:55.290 --> 06:59.534
[David] Anyone who does
should go with Mr. Shore.

06:59.669 --> 07:03.879
No one should be here
except of their own free will.

07:12.682 --> 07:17.597
Sir, this negotiation will take time.
You have hours, maybe minutes.

07:17.729 --> 07:20.596
Then I suggest you speak
to the appropriate authorities

07:21.024 --> 07:22.560
because we've already convened with ours.

07:29.950 --> 07:32.442
Yeah, this is Aaron Shore.
Put me through.

07:33.495 --> 07:36.203
[sighs] Mr. President,
we have a big problem.

07:36.331 --> 07:38.322
[theme music playing]

07:49.970 --> 07:51.210
-[Tom] Hey.
-Hey.

07:52.222 --> 07:53.883
Subpoena prep.

07:54.683 --> 07:58.677
We need to huddle with Kendra this afternoon
before I head over to the FBI.

07:58.812 --> 08:00.223
| cleared the decks.

08:01.481 --> 08:03.563
Seth wants to move
the National Christmas Tree Lighting

08:03.692 --> 08:05.399
to tomorrow afternoon
if that works for you.

08:05.986 --> 08:10.480
Sure. Give the public a sunny image
in case it's a bad news day, right?

08:10.615 --> 08:12.777
[chuckles] Something like that.

08:14.953 --> 08:17.069
I'll be in the Oval if you need me.

08:23.253 --> 08:24.960
[breathes heavily]

08:25.088 --> 08:26.419
[chuckles softly]

08:33.388 --> 08:35.424
-[indistinct chatter]
-[baby cooing]

08:37.767 --> 08:38.756
Thank you.

08:40.729 --> 08:42.470
[Emily] Thanks for agreeing to see me.

08:42.605 --> 08:44.562
Your daughter's beautiful, Carrie.

08:44.691 --> 08:47.774
[sighs] And so very sick.

08:48.862 --> 08:51.775
They say Grace has tetralogy of Fallot.

08:52.782 --> 08:56.275
Which means that not enough blood is getting
to her lungs, not enough oxygen.

08:56.953 --> 08:58.455
She'll turn blue first.

08:59.789 --> 09:01.120
And then, eventually...

09:01.249 --> 09:02.910
None of that has to happen.

09:03.043 --> 09:04.033
I've spoken with the doctors

09:04.169 --> 09:07.002
and with open-heart surgery,
she at least has a chance.

09:07.130 --> 09:09.417
-That's not an option.
-Why not?

09:10.467 --> 09:11.798
Transfusions.

09:14.095 --> 09:16.473
The Bible commands us
to abstain from blood

09:17.098 --> 09:19.305
because only God is the giver of life.

09:19.434 --> 09:21.266
The Bible also commands us
to heal the sick.

09:22.312 --> 09:23.302
Yes.

09:24.773 --> 09:27.265
But your choice would condemn her.

09:27.901 --> 09:32.611
No. It would allow her to laugh and play
and grow up.

09:32.739 --> 09:36.482
| understand why the president
sent you, Ms. Rhodes.

09:37.327 --> 09:38.817
You know Scripture.

09:39.454 --> 09:42.162
Which means you should know
none of those things matter

09:42.290 --> 09:45.828
if we have to violate God's word
in order to attain them.

09:46.586 --> 09:48.577
This is the test we face.

09:50.090 --> 09:53.458
Honoring God when it's easier not to.

09:53.593 --> 09:58.212
Grace doesn't know anything about a test.
She is just trying to breathe.

09:58.348 --> 10:01.181
And I would give my life
to help her do that,

10:02.560 --> 10:04.517
but she's in God's hands now.

10:07.607 --> 10:10.144
Okay, thank you, Emily.
Keep me posted.

10:11.194 --> 10:14.732
Surgeons are standing by,
but the mother won't give her consent.

10:14.864 --> 10:15.899
Why do we need it?

10:16.032 --> 10:17.898
A parent can't withhold lifesaving treatment
from their child

10:18.034 --> 10:19.900
based on a religious compunction.
It's against the law.

10:20.036 --> 10:21.538
It's not clear that it will work.

10:22.288 --> 10:25.826
Open-heart surgery with transfusions
on an infant? It's risky.

10:25.959 --> 10:28.997
If there is no guarantee of the outcome,
we're in a gray area.

10:29.129 --> 10:32.963
Which means our religious faithful are staying
put in that cabin to keep the pressure on.

10:33.091 --> 10:35.833
Aaron, how's it looking on the fire front?

10:35.969 --> 10:39.382
Precarious. I just spoke to
the Parks Department union rep.

10:39.514 --> 10:41.255
He's threatening to tell the firefighters
to stand down.

10:41.391 --> 10:45.510
Mr. President. It's gonna be hard to control
the narrative on this one if it drags on.

10:45.645 --> 10:49.980
Try impossible. Religious activists could slam
you for interfering with the mother's rights.

10:50.108 --> 10:52.349
Children's rights activists will declare you
public enemy number one

10:52.485 --> 10:53.600
if you let the baby die.

10:54.696 --> 10:57.279
Kendra, do we have legal options
that will help us?

10:57.407 --> 11:00.320
There's no legal prohibition
for standing in the path of a fire.

11:00.451 --> 11:03.819
Well, unless you're barking mad,
which these people clearly are.

11:03.955 --> 11:07.118
Clearly? No.
But we can challenge their competency.

11:07.250 --> 11:10.083
If they're a danger to themselves,
we can forcibly remove them.

11:10.211 --> 11:12.077
Which would clear the way
to operate on baby Grace

11:12.213 --> 11:13.669
and solve our problem.

11:15.508 --> 11:19.217
Aaron, I wanna speak to the man
who is leading these people.

11:19.345 --> 11:22.087
-[Aaron] I'll set up the call, sir.
-Okay, thank you.

11:24.392 --> 11:26.724
[Hannah] Chuck, I need to know
if Damian tipped off that banker.

11:26.853 --> 11:29.720
If he did, he may be part of the plot
to frame the First Lady.

11:29.856 --> 11:31.642
And he may be connected to Lloyd.

11:31.774 --> 11:33.060
| can confirm two things.

11:33.193 --> 11:34.649
Damian's SIM card proves

11:34.777 --> 11:36.984
the call that tipped off the banker
came from his number.

11:37.113 --> 11:38.945
And his phone was cloned.

11:39.616 --> 11:40.606
Meaning what?

11:40.742 --> 11:43.825
Someone could have used his number
in an attempt to make him look guilty.

11:43.953 --> 11:46.490
-Okay.
-Or Damian cloned it himself

11:46.623 --> 11:49.832
to throw us off the scent
in case he came under suspicion.

11:49.959 --> 11:51.620
That's a pretty wild theory.

11:52.587 --> 11:54.544
Hannah, how much do you really know
about this guy?

11:54.672 --> 11:56.788
| know he helped me track down Patrick Lloyd.

11:56.925 --> 11:59.383
-What else?
-I know you don't like him.

11:59.510 --> 12:00.887
It's not about that.

12:01.679 --> 12:03.841
| mean, yeah, I don't like him.

12:03.973 --> 12:08.137
His smarmy British superiority,
the way he treats me like his valet...

12:08.269 --> 12:10.931
-Chuck--
-There's something off about him.

12:12.482 --> 12:14.564
| can't put my finger on it. But he's...

12:16.402 --> 12:17.608
...suspect.

12:18.988 --> 12:20.069
Thank you.

12:22.116 --> 12:22.901
For what?

12:23.493 --> 12:24.824
For always looking out for me.

12:25.954 --> 12:27.490
But I can look out for myself.

12:35.838 --> 12:36.873
-[beeps]
-[line rings]

12:37.006 --> 12:38.292
[sighs]

12:39.342 --> 12:41.003
Get me Detective Blakey.

12:42.345 --> 12:45.588
Mr. Sheridan, you and your people
are in a very dangerous position.

12:45.723 --> 12:46.838
| appreciate that, Mr. President.

12:46.975 --> 12:50.934
Then please, come down.
We'll sit together and talk this through.

12:51.062 --> 12:53.394
Will you release Grace to the custody
of her mother?

12:53.523 --> 12:55.810
| don't have the legal authority to do that.

12:55.942 --> 12:58.479
A federal court has decided that
in the best interests of the child,

12:58.611 --> 13:00.727
she's to have the surgery
her mother is trying to stop.

13:00.863 --> 13:04.356
Then, I'm afraid there's nothing for us
to talk about.

13:05.451 --> 13:08.193
Sir, it's Christmastime.

13:09.289 --> 13:11.405
We're supposed to be
celebrating the story of a child

13:11.541 --> 13:13.202
that brings us together,
not pulls us apart.

13:13.334 --> 13:14.836
Yes, sir.

13:16.045 --> 13:20.664
But the Christmas story,
it's a story of faith.

13:20.800 --> 13:23.883
There is no more appropriate time for us
to demonstrate ours.

13:24.679 --> 13:27.091
| have been in touch
with the National Weather Service.

13:27.223 --> 13:30.511
Rain is coming. But even with that
and everything we're throwing at this,

13:30.643 --> 13:33.180
we will not be able to stop the fire
before it reaches you.

13:33.313 --> 13:34.053
| understand.

13:34.188 --> 13:36.520
And I'm in constant contact with Carrie Morgan.

13:36.649 --> 13:41.860
The moment that the government releases
baby Grace into her custody,

13:41.988 --> 13:43.444
we will evacuate.

13:43.573 --> 13:45.405
Not before. Thank you, sir.

13:46.242 --> 13:48.449
Does he strike you as someone
who's lacking competence?

13:48.578 --> 13:51.411
No. He's aware of the danger
and is choosing to ignore it.

13:51.539 --> 13:53.906
Which means he doesn't fit
the legal definition of crazy.

13:54.042 --> 13:56.625
Which means
we've lost our judicial option.

13:56.753 --> 13:59.245
We need to start thinking outside the box,
shake the trees.

13:59.380 --> 14:01.542
Find another solution
that will work for everyone.

14:01.674 --> 14:02.709
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

14:04.886 --> 14:07.253
| just got back from the Shenandoah fire,
Detective Blakey.

14:07.388 --> 14:10.551
I'm running behind, which means
| don't have a lot of time for you today.

14:10.683 --> 14:14.221
| won't take much of it. I got a job
with the Bureau. Closing my case files.

14:14.354 --> 14:15.515
Thought I'd leave you with something.

14:15.646 --> 14:17.353
It's about Damian Rennett.
Security footage.

14:17.482 --> 14:18.688
He's not a White House employee.

14:18.816 --> 14:20.477
So Agent Wells informed me.

14:20.610 --> 14:22.476
Problem is, he doesn't seem to be
anyone's employee.

14:22.612 --> 14:24.944
British embassy won't answer questions
about him. White House won't.

14:25.073 --> 14:26.154
All I can tell you,

14:26.282 --> 14:29.149
he's been detailed here
to help on some investigations.

14:29.285 --> 14:30.446
Here's what I can tell you.

14:30.578 --> 14:33.115
That guy is bad news, Mr. Shore,
as in you shouldn't trust him.

14:33.247 --> 14:35.079
Can you be a little more specific?

14:35.875 --> 14:38.242
Video's pretty specific.
Merry Christmas.

14:53.142 --> 14:55.304
[Foerstel] You know what I learned
as a prosecutor?

14:55.436 --> 14:57.723
The more a target reaches out,
the more they have to hide.

14:57.855 --> 15:02.395
First Lady isn't reaching out. I am.
Lawyer to lawyer with an offer.

15:03.277 --> 15:04.438
I'm listening.

15:04.570 --> 15:06.857
You're on a mission to prove
that the First Lady is involved

15:06.989 --> 15:09.651
in some bribery scandal
with lcarus Astrotech.

15:09.784 --> 15:12.446
It's clear I won't stop you
from pursuing that.

15:12.578 --> 15:14.831
-Correct.
-I wanna ask you something different.

15:15.498 --> 15:18.206
Postpone your subpoena.
Continue your investigation.

15:18.334 --> 15:20.416
You have my word
the First Lady will cooperate.

15:20.545 --> 15:23.378
That's not an offer.
That's an admission of desperation.

15:23.506 --> 15:25.497
The desperation is yours, Mr. Director.

15:25.633 --> 15:27.465
You rushed your subpoena
so you could capitalize

15:27.593 --> 15:31.177
on the pressure on the White House because of
the media coverage of the Icarus investigation.

15:31.305 --> 15:34.218
Your presence here suggests
I've succeeded.

15:34.350 --> 15:35.511
You're worried, Mrs. Danes.

15:35.643 --> 15:36.883
I'm pragmatic.

15:37.019 --> 15:40.057
You have nothing.
But you might strike a lucky blow,

15:40.189 --> 15:42.351
catch her in some trivial contradiction
that you can exploit.

15:42.483 --> 15:43.985
And to forestall that uncertainty,

15:44.110 --> 15:46.272
you're offering a vague promise
of cooperation?

15:46.404 --> 15:50.193
I'll specify it. We'll not oppose
any reasonable discovery request.

15:50.324 --> 15:52.656
Not a single interrogatory or document request.

15:52.785 --> 15:55.618
No, you'll use the additional time
to formulate a better defense.

15:55.746 --> 15:58.408
We already have that defense.
The truth.

15:58.541 --> 15:59.576
The more information you'll find,

15:59.709 --> 16:02.417
the more you'll see the First Lady
isn't complicit in anything.

16:02.545 --> 16:03.956
| have a counter offer.

16:06.841 --> 16:09.003
That's the price for me standing down.

16:09.719 --> 16:13.804
Take it to the First Lady.
Deal expires in two hours.

16:23.649 --> 16:25.765
[Tom] You wanna plead
to obstruction of justice?

16:25.902 --> 16:28.064
To put an end to this investigation, yes.

16:28.196 --> 16:30.938
Foerstel's offering me a no contest plea.

16:31.073 --> 16:33.656
That's not an admission
of criminal conduct.

16:33.784 --> 16:35.866
But legally
it's equal to a conviction, right?

16:35.995 --> 16:39.204
Yes, but Foerstel's got the US attorney
to suspend any sentence

16:39.332 --> 16:42.450
and to grant Mrs. Kirkman immunity from
any other events arising out of these facts.

16:42.585 --> 16:44.701
There won't be other events.

16:44.837 --> 16:47.875
Tom, I understand that
and so does Foerstel.

16:48.007 --> 16:51.420
Tying me to a bribery conspiracy
will be a hard case to make.

16:52.053 --> 16:54.636
But he's offering an obstruction plea

16:54.764 --> 16:57.222
so that he gets to walk away with something
after all this

16:57.350 --> 16:58.590
and I get to reduce risk.

17:00.228 --> 17:01.559
What's her exposure if she walks away?

17:01.687 --> 17:03.269
If today's questioning doesn't go well,

17:03.397 --> 17:05.308
she'll be looking at an indictment
on a bribery charge.

17:05.441 --> 17:08.148
| take the plea and we get to walk away
from this nonsense.

17:08.277 --> 17:10.063
Innocent people don't plead.

17:10.195 --> 17:12.654
Tom, we've been through
everything Foerstel has.

17:12.781 --> 17:18.573
It paints a false but damning
circumstantial case of a conspiracy.

17:18.704 --> 17:21.366
The best course is for me
to take the Fifth to everything.

17:21.499 --> 17:22.739
That screams evasion.

17:22.875 --> 17:25.913
Per our agreement with Director Foerstel,
the proceedings are sealed.

17:26.045 --> 17:27.455
We all know how Washington works.

17:27.588 --> 17:30.171
Eventually, it'll leak
and that will dog my wife's life forever.

17:30.299 --> 17:34.167
Tom, Foerstel is a really smart guy.
| answer his questions,

17:34.303 --> 17:38.513
he twists my words,
he exploits the inevitable ambiguities.

17:38.641 --> 17:40.348
There is no perfect solution to this.

17:40.476 --> 17:43.468
Maybe not, but there's the right one,
which is us fighting, you fighting.

17:43.604 --> 17:44.810
No deal, no plea.

17:44.939 --> 17:48.682
I'm dealing with 20 people who are holed up
in a cabin willing to die for their beliefs.

17:48.818 --> 17:51.059
Here's what I believe in:
Your innocence.

17:51.946 --> 17:55.655
And that's worth fighting for.
That's where I stand. Excuse me.

17:59.328 --> 18:00.284
[Alex sighs]

18:06.460 --> 18:07.791
Please.

18:10.339 --> 18:13.331
How long have you had these suspicions
about Damian?

18:13.467 --> 18:16.960
Few days. Since I learned the banker
who tried to set up the First Lady

18:17.096 --> 18:18.427
could've been tipped off by Damian.

18:18.556 --> 18:21.264
But you don't think the intel
you've acquired so far is conclusive.

18:21.392 --> 18:24.805
It's not. Especially if somebody
tried to clone his phone and set him up.

18:26.606 --> 18:29.473
Detective Blakey gave me this video.

18:29.609 --> 18:32.567
It's from the warehouse fire
that you two were in the middle of.

18:32.695 --> 18:34.686
Yeah, Damian got there early, cut the fence.

18:34.822 --> 18:37.985
No. If you check the time stamp,
he got there two hours before.

18:38.117 --> 18:39.528
He cut the fence and walked through,

18:39.660 --> 18:42.402
which makes him a prime suspect
for the arson.

18:42.538 --> 18:46.372
Two hours before me?
There has to be some explanation.

18:46.500 --> 18:49.492
There is evidence
Damian is working against our interests.

18:49.629 --> 18:51.461
Now, you know that.

18:51.589 --> 18:53.921
You come to me and try
to cast doubt on that evidence--

18:54.050 --> 18:57.384
No. Aaron, I did not.

18:58.471 --> 19:00.803
Come on, Hannah, I know you two are involved.

19:02.808 --> 19:04.185
As national security advisor,

19:04.310 --> 19:06.972
you don't think I know
what people in this building are up to?

19:07.563 --> 19:10.021
Especially people who report to me?

19:11.734 --> 19:15.728
-Okay, so what next?
-[sighs]

19:15.863 --> 19:19.276
Damian helped us capture and kill Lloyd.
That much we know.

19:19.408 --> 19:22.742
What we need to find out is why
he's trying to tank our investigation

19:22.870 --> 19:25.202
into who's framing the First Lady.

19:25.331 --> 19:28.949
But that "we" doesn't include you.
You're sitting this one out.

19:29.085 --> 19:31.543
-Let me run a sting.
-[chuckles] No.

19:32.713 --> 19:33.703
You think I'm compromised.

19:33.839 --> 19:37.082
| know you're compromised,
which is why he was able to play you.

19:39.428 --> 19:42.090
The fact is no one can get closer to him
than I can.

19:42.223 --> 19:45.011
And now I have a score to settle.
Let me do this.

19:49.271 --> 19:52.889
All right. Under my direction.

19:53.025 --> 19:54.527
And you're on a short leash.

19:58.614 --> 20:00.901
Dr. Rune, thank you very much for coming.

20:01.033 --> 20:03.411
Your political director was quite insistent.

20:03.536 --> 20:06.028
He knows talent when he sees it.
Please.

20:06.872 --> 20:09.580
You have a remarkable background.
13 patents.

20:09.709 --> 20:12.417
I've been told you were responsible
for groundbreaking work

20:12.545 --> 20:14.502
in the use of artificial blood
in pediatric surgery.

20:14.630 --> 20:15.995
Yes, sir.

20:16.132 --> 20:19.796
Could you perform open-heart surgery
on an infant using your new techniques?

20:21.137 --> 20:24.095
-[sighs] Theoretically, yes. But I can't.
-Why not?

20:26.142 --> 20:29.351
Every licensing board
has stripped me of my credentials.

20:29.478 --> 20:33.597
| lost my license in DC in 2009
after I performed a liver transplant

20:33.733 --> 20:37.692
using technology which had not yet
been approved by the AMA.

20:37.820 --> 20:39.652
The patient survived.
My career did not.

20:39.780 --> 20:41.191
We know that.

20:41.323 --> 20:44.031
And Congress normally controls
the regulatory authority

20:44.160 --> 20:47.528
over the District of Columbia,
except when it's in recess,

20:47.663 --> 20:50.405
which it is, then it reverts back to me.

20:52.001 --> 20:56.290
Based on everything I've read,
I'd be more than happy to reinstate you.

20:56.422 --> 21:01.838
Sir, I believe in my research
and I'm confident in my abilities.

21:01.969 --> 21:03.380
But medicine is like art.

21:03.512 --> 21:07.221
The surgery will be very risky.
| can't guarantee an outcome.

21:07.349 --> 21:10.592
I'm not asking you to.
I'm asking you to try.

21:11.353 --> 21:13.970
Doctor, if you don't intervene,
this child will not make it.

21:15.775 --> 21:19.018
- I will do my best, sir.
-Thank you.

21:19.153 --> 21:20.643
-[reporters clamoring]
-[reporter] The American public

21:20.780 --> 21:23.693
wants to know why the president's
pandering to religion.

21:23.824 --> 21:25.690
He's not.
He's honoring freedom of expression.

21:25.826 --> 21:27.567
By caving to religious extremists?

21:27.703 --> 21:30.161
By finding a solution
that respects individual rights,

21:30.289 --> 21:32.656
but protects baby Grace.
It's called being president.

21:32.792 --> 21:35.830
What do the hundreds of firefighters
he's putting in harm's way call it?

21:36.837 --> 21:37.998
Their job.

21:38.130 --> 21:39.746
[reporters clamoring]

21:39.882 --> 21:41.623
[soft music playing over speakers]

21:42.718 --> 21:45.551
-What's this?
-My people call it a present.

21:46.514 --> 21:47.470
Open it.

21:54.230 --> 21:54.970
Maui?

21:55.105 --> 21:59.224
| put in for a week with the embassy.
Got us a beach-front room.

21:59.360 --> 22:01.101
But I didn't get you anything.

22:01.237 --> 22:03.228
Well, you still got time.

22:03.906 --> 22:06.568
A good spy is skilled
at the art of deception.

22:09.328 --> 22:12.286
What can I say?
My guard is down around you.

22:12.414 --> 22:13.700
[chuckles]

22:16.585 --> 22:17.575
Wow.

22:18.504 --> 22:20.836
Put it on.
You'll class up the joint.

22:27.888 --> 22:31.882
Just don't wear it to Hawaii.
| don't wanna watch the clock.

22:32.768 --> 22:36.181
Speaking of time, have you got an hour
for an afternoon diversion?

22:36.313 --> 22:39.021
| wish I did.
I'm following a lead on our banker.

22:39.149 --> 22:39.980
Yeah?

22:40.109 --> 22:42.225
Yeah. I couldn't sleep last night.

22:42.361 --> 22:45.149
| was up the whole night
working on my laptop.

22:45.281 --> 22:48.114
But if I find anything,
I'll let you know, okay?

22:53.622 --> 22:57.456
[Tom on phone] Mrs. Morgan, Emily tells me
you have concerns about the surgery.

22:57.585 --> 22:58.450
Yes, sir.

22:58.586 --> 22:59.747
How can I help?

22:59.879 --> 23:02.462
[sighs] Tell me this isn't a trick.

23:02.590 --> 23:05.002
Mrs. Morgan, I consider myself
to be an honest man.

23:05.134 --> 23:08.343
And as a person,
I understand your conflict.

23:08.470 --> 23:11.303
But as a parent, I completely disagree
with what you've chosen to do.

23:11.432 --> 23:14.641
I don't believe that religious text
is some inflexible doctrine.

23:15.394 --> 23:17.431
| think of it more as a guideline.

23:17.563 --> 23:20.601
If you ask me a question,
| will tell you the truth as I know it.

23:20.733 --> 23:22.849
When I give you my word,
| give you my word.

23:24.445 --> 23:25.435
Thank you, sir.

23:29.074 --> 23:31.816
-The doctor will explain everything.
-Okay.

23:33.704 --> 23:36.446
First, wind slows the fire's progress.
Now rain does.

23:36.582 --> 23:38.448
Random atmospheric disturbances.

23:38.584 --> 23:40.450
You're not buying this whole
divine intervention thing?

23:40.586 --> 23:43.294
-Couldn't be buying it less.
-What part of you is agnostic?

23:43.422 --> 23:44.878
[chuckles] The part that isn't sure

23:45.007 --> 23:47.715
whether this is the most
boring conversation I've ever had.

23:47.843 --> 23:49.800
Awash in holiday cheer, I see.

23:49.929 --> 23:52.341
Let me ask you a question about Ramadan.

23:52.473 --> 23:55.181
You got the wrong guy. I was adopted.
My last name's Wright.

23:55.309 --> 23:57.175
Huh. I'm Jewish.

23:57.311 --> 24:00.178
Yeah, Boone is the Americanization
of Baranowsky.

24:00.314 --> 24:02.897
Look at that, see, we finally learned
something personal about each other.

24:03.025 --> 24:05.983
-Yeah. Let's never do this again.
-Definitely not.

24:06.111 --> 24:08.022
[girls singing]
g Silent night I

24:08.155 --> 24:10.943
-Sorry, girls. No time right now.
-[girls] Aw...

24:12.409 --> 24:15.117
-[Damian] Hello?
-[Hannah] Hey, Damian, it's me.

24:15.245 --> 24:18.533
- I thought you were working.
-If you still wanna meet, I've freed up.

24:18.666 --> 24:21.328
Sorry, I'm at the embassy.
See you for dinner?

24:21.460 --> 24:22.746
Sure, see you then.

24:23.837 --> 24:24.622
He's at the embassy.

24:24.755 --> 24:27.543
British Embassy is on Massachusetts Avenue,
heart of DC.

24:27.675 --> 24:30.383
The tracker in the watch you gave him
puts him in Arlington, Virginia.

24:30.511 --> 24:32.343
Where I live.

24:33.889 --> 24:34.720
Okay.

24:34.848 --> 24:38.261
| can access your computer
through Remote Desktop Protocol,

24:38.394 --> 24:40.510
but you'll need to put in your password.

24:46.026 --> 24:47.232
Hannah.

24:55.869 --> 24:57.576
[sighs] You're toast, mate.

25:04.503 --> 25:07.291
Hey. I just wanted to wish you good luck.

25:07.423 --> 25:10.791
[sighs] It seems like everyone is gonna
be needing that today.

25:10.926 --> 25:12.087
[chuckles]

25:14.096 --> 25:15.211
Whatever you decide to do,

25:15.347 --> 25:19.090
answer Foerstel's questions or not,
| know you'll make the right choice.

25:20.185 --> 25:21.050
Thank you.

25:25.441 --> 25:26.272
Alex...

25:27.943 --> 25:30.230
| know these last few days
have been awful.

25:31.280 --> 25:33.317
I'm just so angry
that they're doing this to you.

25:36.118 --> 25:37.608
Whatever happens when you get back,

25:37.745 --> 25:40.282
I'll take tonight off
and try and make it up to you.

25:42.916 --> 25:43.951
Is that a promise?

25:44.084 --> 25:46.746
[chuckles] Yeah, it's a promise.

25:49.631 --> 25:51.087
I'll see you soon.

25:53.761 --> 25:55.718

26:12.654 --> 26:14.691
Chuck, can you run a plate?

26:16.575 --> 26:18.486
[indistinct chatter]

26:22.623 --> 26:24.660
I'm afraid we've hit a snag.

26:24.792 --> 26:26.874
The heart-lung machine
that's pumping the artificial blood

26:27.002 --> 26:28.663
is working as hard as it can.

26:28.796 --> 26:30.662
But Grace is hypoxemic.

26:31.924 --> 26:33.210
| don't understand.

26:33.342 --> 26:35.379
Synthetic blood
is not as efficient as the real thing.

26:35.511 --> 26:37.878
Her cells are not getting enough oxygen.

26:38.013 --> 26:40.846
As surgery progresses,
she needs more, not less.

26:42.142 --> 26:43.257
Meaning what?

26:43.393 --> 26:44.975
| can't continue without hemoglobin.

26:45.687 --> 26:49.396
Your daughter needs
a blood transfusion, ma'am. Real stuff.

26:50.025 --> 26:52.608
Your blood type is AB negative.

26:52.736 --> 26:54.113
Same as your daughter's.

26:54.238 --> 26:56.354
Your blood might save her.

26:58.951 --> 27:00.362
[sighs]

27:04.873 --> 27:06.910
-Carrie.
-No.

27:07.042 --> 27:10.501
You gave Grace life.
Why can't you give her your blood?

27:10.629 --> 27:12.586
Because I can't.

27:12.714 --> 27:16.548
You've already agreed to the use
of artificial blood to save her.

27:16.677 --> 27:19.840
You're not gonna agree to use
your own? That doesn't make sense.

27:19.972 --> 27:21.758
-You're trying to trick me.
-No, I'm not.

27:21.890 --> 27:23.927
All I'm trying to do is save Grace.

27:24.059 --> 27:26.391
And I know that's what you want, too.

27:46.165 --> 27:48.076

27:51.628 --> 27:53.414
[reporters clamoring]

27:53.547 --> 27:55.458
[reporter 1] Here she comes. Second car!

28:01.346 --> 28:03.508
-[reporter 2] Madam First Lady!
-[reporter 3] Just two seconds!

28:03.640 --> 28:05.096
[reporter 4] How long have you been
under investigation?

28:05.225 --> 28:06.841
[reporter 5]
Has the president known all along?

28:06.977 --> 28:08.593
[reporter 6] Is the White House counsel
defending you?

28:08.729 --> 28:09.844
[reporter 7] Are you going to plead?

28:09.980 --> 28:11.436
What about Icarus?
Did you take a bribe?

28:11.565 --> 28:13.272
[reporter 8] Is the president involved?

28:13.400 --> 28:15.767
[reporters continue clamoring]

28:15.903 --> 28:19.066
| don't understand. There must have been
a dozen cameras there.

28:19.198 --> 28:20.859
How did they know?
My testimony is under seal.

28:20.991 --> 28:24.575
But your presence here is not.
Foerstel probably leaked it to the media.

28:24.703 --> 28:27.741
So he's trying to hem me in.
Compel me to answer questions.

28:27.873 --> 28:30.114
All these reporters,
| take the Fifth, it's gonna leak.

28:30.250 --> 28:33.618
It's dirty pool, Mrs. Kirkman.
And you don't want to play.

28:33.754 --> 28:35.711
- I have to.
-No, you don't.

28:35.839 --> 28:39.503
Your appearance here was tied to
a condition that no longer exists.

28:39.635 --> 28:40.796
-What? Secrecy?
-Yes.

28:40.928 --> 28:43.636
Even if we can't connect Foerstel
directly to the leak,

28:43.764 --> 28:46.973
no court is gonna find you
in contempt if we walk away.

28:47.100 --> 28:49.182
Then what happens?
He re-issues the subpoena.

28:49.311 --> 28:51.177
And you and I both know
we'll be back here.

28:51.313 --> 28:53.680
Could be weeks, could be months.
But we will be back.

28:53.815 --> 28:56.682
But Foerstel won't have that element
of surprise. It will be a fair fight.

28:56.818 --> 29:00.402
No. I can't live like this. Not anymore.

29:00.530 --> 29:03.488
One way or another,
this investigation ends today.

29:09.915 --> 29:12.828
-You wanna unseal the proceedings?
-Yes.

29:13.919 --> 29:16.661
-May I ask why?
-Does it matter?

29:16.797 --> 29:19.380
If you expect a quid pro quo,
it does. There won't be one.

29:19.508 --> 29:21.169
| won't limit the scope of the subpoena

29:21.301 --> 29:23.212
simply because you agree
to make your testimony public.

29:23.345 --> 29:25.552
[Alex] I'm not asking you
to limit the scope of anything.

29:25.681 --> 29:28.890
The subpoena, the bounds of decency.
Nor your ambition.

29:31.270 --> 29:35.889
- I don't know what you think I did here.
-Oh, we both know what you did.

29:36.525 --> 29:38.562
The question now
is what you're going to do.

29:43.991 --> 29:45.573
Consider the proceedings unsealed.

29:47.577 --> 29:48.703
Thank you.

30:03.969 --> 30:04.925
How you doing?

30:05.887 --> 30:08.504
There's a line of Scripture
| keep repeating.

30:10.142 --> 30:13.260
"I will lift up my hand to the nations."

30:13.395 --> 30:15.932
"And your daughters shall be
carried on their shoulders."

30:16.064 --> 30:18.897
Isaiah. It's about salvation.

30:20.736 --> 30:23.103
I'm interested in the part
about saving daughters.

30:26.033 --> 30:27.398
Are you devout?

30:27.534 --> 30:29.696
No. Nine years of Catholic school.

30:29.828 --> 30:33.037
But I never... I never saw God there.

30:34.374 --> 30:36.206
-I'm sorry.
-Don't be.

30:37.085 --> 30:39.201
| see God in other places.

30:40.339 --> 30:41.875
Like in a mother's love.

30:43.342 --> 30:44.332
[cell phone vibrates]

30:45.844 --> 30:47.084
The doctor needs us.

30:50.015 --> 30:51.096
[sighs]

30:52.225 --> 30:55.843
Grace has been through a lot. We had
to repair her pulmonary valve as well.

30:55.979 --> 30:58.266
[sighs] She's gonna come through it.

30:58.398 --> 31:02.357
-Would you like to see your daughter?
-Yes, please!

31:06.573 --> 31:09.065
-[cell phone beeps]
-[line rings]

31:09.201 --> 31:10.612
Get me the president.

31:13.413 --> 31:14.403
Mr. President.

31:14.539 --> 31:17.657
Baby Grace made it through surgery.
And she's well.

31:17.793 --> 31:19.579
And none of her mother's beliefs
were compromised.

31:20.796 --> 31:22.286
Thank you, Mr. President.

31:22.422 --> 31:23.799
Mr. Sheridan, I kept my word.

31:23.924 --> 31:25.540
-I need you to keep yours.
-Sir?

31:25.675 --> 31:28.212
| need you and your people
to get out of there now.

31:28.637 --> 31:31.629
-[chuckles] Yes, sir.
-Thank you.

31:33.141 --> 31:35.098
[indistinct chatter]

31:35.227 --> 31:37.059
[people coughing]

31:48.281 --> 31:50.943
[reporter] It's been two hours since
First Lady Alex Kirkman

31:51.076 --> 31:52.783
appeared at FBI Headquarters

31:52.911 --> 31:56.120
in response to a subpoena regarding
the ongoing Icarus investigation.

31:56.248 --> 31:59.491
-Mike, gonna need the motorcade.
-Sir?

31:59.626 --> 32:01.788
| want to go to the hospital,
see that little baby.

32:01.920 --> 32:03.081
Yes, sir.

32:04.089 --> 32:05.625
Merry Christmas, sir.

32:05.757 --> 32:07.293
Merry Christmas, Mike.

32:07.426 --> 32:11.169
...First Lady's mother accepted
a bribe in exchange for privileged...

32:18.770 --> 32:20.636
We don't want to sing that song.

32:20.772 --> 32:24.356
Why not? I gave you the music.
You can read music, right?

32:24.484 --> 32:26.395
Yes, but it's not a holiday song.

32:27.195 --> 32:29.357
[sighs] Look...

32:30.824 --> 32:34.283
No one wants
to listen to you, okay?

32:34.411 --> 32:35.993
Nobody.

32:36.121 --> 32:38.988
So it's either my song or the door.

32:40.709 --> 32:41.870
What's it gonna be?

32:44.045 --> 32:47.174
And a one, two, three, four.

32:47.299 --> 32:49.336
[girls vocalizing]

32:51.636 --> 32:54.344
S Looking from a window above
It's like a story-- 7

32:54.473 --> 32:55.338
Stop!

32:56.892 --> 32:59.805
You're coming in a little hot there,
Freckles. Find your level.

32:59.936 --> 33:01.347
And you...

33:02.522 --> 33:05.731
You're pretty good. Keep it up.

33:05.859 --> 33:08.442
And a one, two, three, four.

33:09.654 --> 33:11.361
[Foerstel] Thank you for appearing,
Mrs. Kirkman.

33:11.490 --> 33:14.903
You are here in response
to a subpoena issued by my office

33:15.035 --> 33:18.949
in connection with an investigation
into Icarus Astrotech, correct?

33:19.080 --> 33:20.115
That is correct.

33:20.248 --> 33:21.955
You understand there are no restrictions

33:22.083 --> 33:24.290
as to the confidentiality
of your testimony,

33:24.419 --> 33:26.126
-which will be public record.
-Yes, I do.

33:26.254 --> 33:28.370
Do you wish to invoke
your Fifth Amendment rights?

33:28.507 --> 33:29.747
No, I do not.

33:31.426 --> 33:34.384
Good. Well, let's begin.
This is Exhibit A.

33:34.513 --> 33:36.470
Point of procedure, Mr. Director.

33:36.598 --> 33:39.465
Mrs. Kirkman would like to read
a statement into the public record.

33:39.601 --> 33:40.557
Not necessary.

33:40.685 --> 33:42.847
She'll have ample opportunity to speak
in response to my questions.

33:42.979 --> 33:45.437
For the record, you are refusing
the First Lady's request?

33:51.196 --> 33:52.778
Go right ahead, Mrs. Kirkman.

33:53.365 --> 33:54.651
Thank you.

33:54.783 --> 33:58.071
Based on an investigation
which was spurred by a document

33:58.203 --> 34:00.661
uploaded by
the mass murderer Patrick Lloyd,

34:00.789 --> 34:04.783
which pertained to my father's
heart transplant 30 years ago,

34:04.918 --> 34:09.583
the FBI has now been investigating me
and my family for almost three months.

34:09.714 --> 34:12.001
To date, that investigation has spawned

34:12.132 --> 34:14.875
numerous document requests
and interrogatories.

34:15.011 --> 34:19.300
A subpoena to my 70-year-old mother,
which was quashed and a subpoena to me.

34:19.431 --> 34:20.684
Excuse me, Mrs. Kirkman,

34:20.809 --> 34:24.928
your opinion on this investigation
has no relevance as to its merits.

34:25.063 --> 34:27.804
-Can my client continue?
-No. She can answer my questions.

34:27.940 --> 34:30.148
Let the record reflect
that Director Foerstel

34:30.277 --> 34:32.893
refused to let Mrs. Kirkman
finish her statement.

34:33.989 --> 34:36.356
Please finish up, Mrs. Kirkman. Quickly.

34:36.491 --> 34:41.031
That investigation has involved
34 FBI employees

34:41.161 --> 34:42.822
at a cost of $16 million--

34:42.956 --> 34:45.493
-Where did you get this information?
-An FOIA request.

34:45.625 --> 34:48.242
If it's inaccurate,
we're happy to amend the record.

34:48.378 --> 34:50.995
-Your statement is now concluded.
-Almost. Almost.

34:51.130 --> 34:54.293
At the inception of this investigation,

34:54.426 --> 34:57.794
Director Foerstel formed
an exploratory committee for a senate bid.

34:57.929 --> 34:58.885
Turn the recorder off.

34:59.014 --> 35:02.097
He also formed
a political action committee.

35:02.225 --> 35:04.091
You heard me. Turn it off!

35:10.817 --> 35:13.024
-Hey.
-Hey. [sighs]

35:13.778 --> 35:15.689
We got the plates back
from the suspect's car,

35:15.822 --> 35:17.483
the guy who met with Damian.

35:18.491 --> 35:20.357
Why didn't Chuck
just give me this directly?

35:20.493 --> 35:23.736
He thought it best you hear it from me.
He was right.

35:23.872 --> 35:26.614
The car comes back to the Russian embassy.

35:26.750 --> 35:30.709
<i>The driver was Oleg Pushkin.
He's an attache there. He's also FSB.</i>

35:30.837 --> 35:34.000
And it's not the first time
he's met with Damian.

35:34.132 --> 35:35.918
| think you know where I'm going with this.

35:36.051 --> 35:37.507
Damian is MI6.

35:37.636 --> 35:39.092
Yes. He may have turned.

35:39.721 --> 35:42.304
We never found a connection
between Patrick Lloyd and Russia.

35:42.432 --> 35:44.890
Meaning whatever interest
Russia could have

35:45.018 --> 35:48.261
in thwarting the Icarus investigation
that Lloyd started is a mystery.

35:48.396 --> 35:50.888
Maybe Russia's just taking advantage
of the situation.

35:51.024 --> 35:53.436
Destabilize our government
by making us chase our tail.

35:53.568 --> 35:55.525
Or maybe we're missing something.

35:55.654 --> 35:57.270
No, maybe I miss something.

35:57.405 --> 35:59.362
I'm gonna bring Damian in and find out.

35:59.491 --> 36:00.652
Hannah...

36:01.326 --> 36:05.490
if this guy is who we think he is,
he's beyond dangerous.

36:05.622 --> 36:06.862
That may be true, Aaron,

36:06.998 --> 36:09.080
but no one is more dangerous
than I am right now.

36:09.209 --> 36:11.416
This is my mess.
| will clean it up.

36:11.544 --> 36:13.626
All right.
Put your team together.

36:20.428 --> 36:22.385
[bell tolling]

36:41.533 --> 36:43.900
So what is this big surprise?

36:45.620 --> 36:46.451
That I know.

36:47.872 --> 36:49.124
Know what?

36:49.791 --> 36:51.077
About the warehouse fire.

36:51.876 --> 36:54.743
Alfonso Lang. Oleg Pushkin.

36:54.879 --> 36:57.541
- I don't understand.
-Yes, you do.

36:59.634 --> 37:00.715
Okay.

37:01.386 --> 37:05.004
Let's start from the top.
| saved you from that warehouse fire.

37:05.140 --> 37:06.801
After you set it.

37:07.976 --> 37:12.186
| trusted you. I really trusted you,
and you lied to me about everything.

37:12.313 --> 37:13.565
| didn't lie.

37:13.690 --> 37:14.680
Turn around.

37:15.608 --> 37:19.693
Middle of a bridge. That's smart.

37:19.821 --> 37:23.155
-Nowhere for me to go, right?
-I know where you're going.

37:23.283 --> 37:25.194
-You're gonna be there a long time.
-Hannah.

37:25.326 --> 37:27.317
Turn around
and put your hands on your head.

37:28.163 --> 37:31.451
| need to show you something.
It'll explain everything.

37:31.583 --> 37:34.416
| just need to reach into my pocket, okay?

37:34.544 --> 37:36.876
-You reach for anything, you're dead.
- I have to, Hannah.

37:37.756 --> 37:38.917
Damian.

38:23.134 --> 38:25.216
[baby cooing]

38:33.728 --> 38:36.846
Hello, Tom Kirkman's voicemail.

38:37.565 --> 38:39.602
This is Tom Kirkman's wife,

38:39.734 --> 38:44.570
who is no longer the subject or target
of a federal investigation.

38:45.824 --> 38:47.861
| beat it.

38:47.992 --> 38:49.244
We beat it.

38:50.036 --> 38:54.496
And the only thing I wanna say to you
is I love you.

38:55.500 --> 38:56.706
[sighs]

39:00.255 --> 39:02.246
[indistinct chatter]

39:36.958 --> 39:38.915
[panting]

40:00.940 --> 40:02.726
[sirens wailing]

40:20.919 --> 40:22.159
-[horn blares]
-[tires screech]

41:45.586 --> 41:47.247
