00:06.339 --> 00:08.425
<i>Something happened, Dad.</i>

00:08.425 --> 00:10.510
<i>I hit somebody.
He died.</i>

00:10.510 --> 00:12.303
<i>I drove away.</i>

00:12.303 --> 00:13.888

- We go big.</i>

01:28.797 --> 01:31.049

<i>green light.</i>

11:37.363 --> 11:40.533
<i>slow, tense music</i>

11:40.533 --> 11:43.369
<i>It's quite common
for an incarcerated individual</i>

11:43.369 --> 11:45.413
<i>to question if he has
anything to live for.</i>

11:47.456 --> 11:50.209
<i>Do you believe that
you pose a danger to yourself?</i>

11:54.922 --> 11:56.215
<i>It's my job to determine</i>

11:56.215 --> 11:59.427
<i>whether or not
your life is at risk.</i>

12:05.099 --> 12:07.893
<i>You've suffered

12:07.893 --> 12:10.896
<i>I understand the pain
you're experiencing</i>

12:10.896 --> 12:13.441
<i>must be relentless.</i>

12:14.358 --> 12:16.736
<i>I'd like to explore</i>

12:16.736 --> 12:19.321
<i>the possibility</i>

12:19.321 --> 12:22.324
<i>that you can
learn to live with it.</i>

12:29.331 --> 12:31.375
<i>Looks like Desire.</i>

12:31.375 --> 12:33.544
<i>We think Carlo
was the intended target.</i>

12:33.544 --> 12:35.087
<i>Oh, oh, you th-you think?</i>

12:35.087 --> 12:37.548
<i>This is the second time

<i>Oh, my God.</i>

12:42.762 --> 12:44.138
<i>He got away.</i>

12:44.138 --> 12:45.806
<i>Does NOPD have any idea
where he is?</i>

12:45.806 --> 12:47.600
<i>We'll catch him.</i>

12:47.600 --> 12:49.769
<i>I don't think
the step-up in weight has slowed</i>

12:49.769 --> 12:53.564
<i>Castro down one bit. Olafs
gets one off of Castro's temple,</i>

<i>A big left hand from Castro!</i>

13:01.739 --> 13:03.449
Looks like it could be--

13:03.449 --> 13:05.159
Raid, raid.

13:05.159 --> 13:06.619
<i>Raid, raid, raid!</i>

13:16.295 --> 13:18.798
<i>NOPD!
- Let me see your hands!</i>

13:18.798 --> 13:20.466
<i>Hands up! Hands up!</i>

13:20.466 --> 13:22.468
<i>Go, against the wall. Come on!
-</i>

13:22.468 --> 13:23.803
Don't move.

13:23.803 --> 13:26.305
<i>We didn't do shit.
- Move!</i>

13:27.431 --> 13:28.933
Clear. Clear.

13:28.933 --> 13:30.518
<i>Where the fuck is he?</i>

13:31.519 --> 13:33.562
<i>Where the fuck is who?</i>

13:35.105 --> 13:36.982
<i>Eugene Jones.</i>

13:36.982 --> 13:38.442
<i>We know he lives here.</i>

13:38.442 --> 13:41.403
<i>We need to find him.</i>

13:47.535 --> 13:49.411
<i>She's resting.</i>

13:59.046 --> 14:00.798
<i>Yes?</i>

14:00.798 --> 14:03.467
<i>That wasn't
a sanctioned hit on your son.</i>

14:04.260 --> 14:05.803
<i>I never gave that order.</i>

14:05.803 --> 14:09.306
<i>The shooter was
a member of Desire, no?</i>

14:10.224 --> 14:12.685
<i>Young men are impulsive.</i>

14:13.310 --> 14:15.771
<i>Given your offspring,
I think you'd understand that.</i>

14:15.771 --> 14:18.524
<i>If you don't have
control over your men,</i>

14:18.524 --> 14:21.277
<i>why am I talking to you?</i>

14:23.195 --> 14:25.447
<i>This was personal.</i>

14:25.447 --> 14:28.284
<i>You know exactly why he did it.</i>

14:29.243 --> 14:31.328
<i>I guess I should just
let it go, then?</i>

14:31.328 --> 14:34.707
<i>Like I said,
I ain't give that order.</i>

14:35.749 --> 14:38.627
<i>So let's not make this
into an all-out war.</i>

14:38.627 --> 14:41.589
<i>Okay. Turn him over to me.</i>

14:42.339 --> 14:44.633
<i>I ain't got him.</i>

14:45.968 --> 14:47.553
<i>So get him.</i>

14:52.600 --> 14:54.727
<i>I need you to find Eugene.</i>

14:57.146 --> 14:59.064
<i>And bring him to me.</i>

14:59.064 --> 15:00.399
<i>Now.</i>

15:26.967 --> 15:30.804
<i>Why can't you people
just let me die in peace?</i>

15:31.388 --> 15:35.768
<i>Now, what kind of way is that
to start a conversation?</i>

15:36.560 --> 15:39.605
<i>I don't need more psych evals.</i>

15:39.605 --> 15:42.441
<i>Let's think of it like
an introductory chat.</i>

15:42.441 --> 15:44.068
<i>A first date, if you will.</i>

15:44.068 --> 15:45.444
<i>You want to start?</i>

15:47.571 --> 15:50.282
<i>No? Okay. I'll go first.</i>

15:50.282 --> 15:52.368
<i>My name is Oliva Delmont.</i>

15:52.368 --> 15:54.578
<i>I am from Hackensack,

<i>I am the youngest

<i>Oh, my God.
- Tragic Jets fan.</i>

15:58.999 --> 16:02.461
<i>And a firm believer that
Geminis are not to be trusted.</i>

16:03.754 --> 16:06.465
<i>So, you're not a psychiatrist?</i>

16:06.465 --> 16:09.969
<i>But I did take Intro to Psych
in college.</i>

16:12.346 --> 16:14.848
<i>I'm an assistant U.S. attorney</i>

16:14.848 --> 16:17.434
<i>for the Eastern
District of Louisiana.</i>

16:22.815 --> 16:23.816
<i>Guard.</i>

16:23.816 --> 16:24.775
<i>That was quick.</i>

16:24.775 --> 16:26.777
<i>I didn't authorize any visitors.</i>

16:26.777 --> 16:29.154
<i>Yeah, one of the perks
of being a federal prosecutor.</i>

16:29.154 --> 16:30.322
<i>You know that.</i>

16:30.322 --> 16:32.282
<i>Guard!</i>

16:32.282 --> 16:33.993
<i>You're gonna
talk to me, Michael.</i>

16:43.836 --> 16:47.172
<i>Whatever it is you want,
the answer's no.</i>

16:47.172 --> 16:49.008
<i>Now, that's not any fun, is it?</i>

16:49.008 --> 16:51.343
<i>At least give me a shot.</i>

16:51.343 --> 16:53.012
<i>Now, I don't want to bore you</i>

16:53.012 --> 16:55.347
<i>with the mundanity
of my caseload,</i>

16:55.347 --> 16:57.474
<i>but suffice it to say...</i>

16:57.474 --> 17:01.145
<i>your relationship with
the Baxter family intrigues me.</i>

17:01.145 --> 17:03.480
<i>I don't have a relationship</i>

17:03.480 --> 17:05.190
<i>with the Baxter family.</i>

17:05.190 --> 17:07.693
<i>Michael...</i>

17:07.693 --> 17:10.154
<i>I am offering you
a chance to help bring down</i>

17:10.154 --> 17:13.532
<i>the single greatest threat
to New Orleans,</i>

17:13.532 --> 17:15.701
<i>to atone for what you have done,</i>

17:15.701 --> 17:17.870
<i>to help the world be
a little bit better,</i>

17:17.870 --> 17:20.372
<i>or you could do it
for the same reason I do.</i>

17:21.707 --> 17:24.168
<i>I like chasing the bad guys.</i>

17:24.168 --> 17:25.961
<i>I can't help you.</i>

17:25.961 --> 17:27.588
<i>Let me worry about that.</i>

17:28.964 --> 17:30.382
<i>Okay.</i>

17:30.382 --> 17:32.843
<i>Then I won't help you.</i>

17:32.843 --> 17:34.887
<i>We'll see.</i>

17:53.781 --> 17:56.492
<i>You having a good workout?</i>

17:58.285 --> 18:00.829
<i>Yeah. How's Fia?</i>

18:00.829 --> 18:02.915
<i>She's traumatized, Carlo.</i>

18:05.042 --> 18:06.293
<i>I get it.</i>

18:06.293 --> 18:07.836
<i>Do you?</i>

18:07.836 --> 18:09.088
<i>Of course.</i>

18:09.963 --> 18:11.965
<i>Why the fuck
are you beating up a bag</i>

18:11.965 --> 18:14.968
<i>when that son of a bitch
is still on the loose?</i>

18:17.930 --> 18:21.975
<i>Jimmy Baxter
knew about the hit-and-run.</i>

18:22.768 --> 18:25.896
<i>I had to protect Adam.</i>

18:26.855 --> 18:30.526
<i>Wh-When Carlo
was charged with...</i>

18:30.526 --> 18:31.777
Carlo Baxter?

18:31.777 --> 18:34.404
Yes. When, uh,

18:34.404 --> 18:36.240
<i>when he was charged</i>

18:36.240 --> 18:40.035
<i>with killing Kofi Jones, I...</i>

18:40.035 --> 18:43.956
<i>I made sure the trial
was in my courtroom.</i>

18:44.456 --> 18:46.875
In cooperation with whom?

18:48.460 --> 18:50.712
Jimmy Baxter.

18:50.712 --> 18:52.756
And then you rigged the trial.

18:52.756 --> 18:54.800
I did.

18:57.344 --> 19:00.722
<i>I was trying to save my son.</i>

19:04.184 --> 19:05.769
<i>Where is he now?</i>

19:06.562 --> 19:08.147
<i>He's in custody.</i>

19:08.147 --> 19:10.149
<i>I picked him up at the hospital
last night.</i>

19:10.149 --> 19:12.234
<i>Who's representing him?</i>

19:12.234 --> 19:13.861
<i>He waived counsel.</i>

19:14.736 --> 19:16.655
<i>Doesn't have any fight
left in him.</i>

19:17.906 --> 19:19.992
<i>So, why's
the justice department here?</i>

19:20.617 --> 19:24.037
<i>This confession steps
on a federal investigation.</i>

19:25.914 --> 19:28.000
<i>He's a judge
who conspired with a mobster</i>

19:28.000 --> 19:31.044
<i>to corrupt a murder trial.
How is that not enough for you?</i>

19:31.044 --> 19:34.131
<i>This is not just about one man.</i>

19:34.131 --> 19:36.633
<i>I want to eradicate</i>

19:36.633 --> 19:39.178
<i>an entire criminal
organization for good,</i>

19:39.178 --> 19:43.640
<i>so I need you
to bury his confession.</i>

19:43.640 --> 19:45.142
<i>What the hell's the point
of solving crimes</i>

19:45.142 --> 19:46.977
<i>if we're just gonna
let the criminals walk free?</i>

19:47.811 --> 19:50.272
<i>Michael belongs in prison.</i>

19:50.272 --> 19:53.192
<i>Okay, then send him to prison
for tax evasion.</i>

19:53.192 --> 19:55.944
<i>But the transcripts
must be filed</i>

19:55.944 --> 19:57.863
<i>under seal.</i>

19:57.863 --> 20:01.116
<i>He's no good to me
if Baxter thinks he's a snitch.</i>

20:04.161 --> 20:06.288


20:21.094 --> 20:23.055
<i>Yo.</i>

20:27.392 --> 20:28.894
<i>Hey, yo.</i>

20:30.270 --> 20:31.605
<i>What you looking for?</i>

20:31.605 --> 20:34.024
<i>Not what. Who.</i>

20:34.816 --> 20:35.901
<i>The pussy that lives here--</i>

20:35.901 --> 20:38.070
<i>where is he?
- If you mean</i>

20:38.070 --> 20:40.239
<i>Little Man, we ain't seen him.</i>

20:40.239 --> 20:41.573
<i>Least, not today.</i>

20:41.573 --> 20:43.784
<i>But if you mean Kofi,</i>

20:43.784 --> 20:46.954
<i>he got murdered
by a bitch in OPP.</i>

20:48.121 --> 20:50.874
Drop it, motherfucker.

20:50.874 --> 20:55.003
<i>Gangster my ass, Baxter bitch.</i>

20:57.673 --> 20:59.466
<i>slow, tense music</i>

21:05.055 --> 21:07.349
<i>Come on, come on, come on.
Come on, come on.</i>

21:09.184 --> 21:11.103
Hello, this is Lee Delamere.

21:11.103 --> 21:12.437
<i>Please leave a message.</i>

21:12.437 --> 21:13.897
<i>Miss Lee, it's Eugene.</i>

21:13.897 --> 21:16.149
<i>I-I'm in trouble.
I need your help.</i>

21:17.150 --> 21:19.403
<i>No, no, no, no, no!
- Got your ass.</i>

21:21.071 --> 21:23.573
<i>Hold him.
- Stop! Get off! Hey!</i>

21:24.866 --> 21:26.785
<i>Help! Help! Help!</i>

21:26.785 --> 21:28.996
<i>Help! Help!</i>

21:50.350 --> 21:52.853
<i>You fucking my world,
Little Man.</i>

21:54.646 --> 21:56.773
<i>He killed Kofi.
- Yeah.</i>

21:56.773 --> 21:59.443
<i>So you took a shot and missed.</i>

22:00.610 --> 22:03.322
<i>Well, you already know
what they gonna do to you.</i>

22:03.322 --> 22:06.158
<i>I don't care about
what they do to me.</i>

22:07.784 --> 22:09.244
<i>I care about what they did.</i>

22:09.244 --> 22:11.830
<i>Even if
you took 'em out, what then?</i>

22:11.830 --> 22:14.333
<i>What, you was gonna
run back here?</i>

22:15.709 --> 22:17.210
<i>Think we'd protect you?</i>

22:18.170 --> 22:21.173
<i>Right, so...</i>

22:21.173 --> 22:23.508
<i>your problem become my problem,</i>

22:23.508 --> 22:25.635
<i>which mean you the problem.</i>

22:25.635 --> 22:27.471
<i>I told you to trust
in my long game.</i>

22:27.471 --> 22:28.847
<i>Fuck your long game.</i>

22:32.434 --> 22:33.977
<i>Fuck my long game.</i>

22:35.062 --> 22:37.481
<i>You got the police
looking for you.</i>

22:38.607 --> 22:40.525
<i>Baxters hunting you down.</i>

22:40.525 --> 22:43.028
<i>And you so focused
on running from them</i>

22:43.028 --> 22:44.696
<i>that you ain't stop to think</i>

22:44.696 --> 22:48.241
<i>what the fuck would happen
if Mo found you first.</i>

23:13.183 --> 23:15.143
<i>So, what you gonna do with him?</i>

23:16.895 --> 23:19.231
<i>There's only one way this ends.</i>

23:51.930 --> 23:53.598
<i>slow, dramatic music</i>

24:38.018 --> 24:40.228
<i>I can't do this.</i>

25:14.346 --> 25:15.889
<i>I hate to do this now,
but can we talk about</i>

25:15.889 --> 25:17.766
<i>the poll from last week?</i>

25:17.766 --> 25:18.850
<i>I saw it.</i>

25:18.850 --> 25:21.102
<i>It was good news.</i>

25:21.102 --> 25:22.938
<i>Not anymore, it's not.</i>

25:24.189 --> 25:26.983
<i>Our worst side-by-side numbers</i>

25:26.983 --> 25:30.070
<i>are on public safety and crime.</i>

25:30.570 --> 25:32.656
<i>Well, with the shooting,
crime is on everyone's mind.</i>

25:32.656 --> 25:34.366
<i>These numbers
are going to get worse.</i>

25:34.366 --> 25:35.992
<i>Hey.</i>

25:35.992 --> 25:39.204
<i>Michael Desiato
is like a brother to me.</i>

25:39.204 --> 25:44.376
<i>My godson was murdered
right before his eyes.</i>

25:44.376 --> 25:48.505
<i>So don't talk to me about this
in terms of poll numbers.</i>

25:48.505 --> 25:50.799
<i>Last thing I'll say.</i>

25:50.799 --> 25:54.386
<i>There's a killer on the loose
and voters are scared.</i>

25:54.386 --> 25:56.346
<i>Scared voters</i>

25:56.346 --> 25:59.182
<i>are not Charlie Figaro votes.</i>

26:04.437 --> 26:09.276


26:11.861 --> 26:14.281
<i>Why did this happen?</i>

26:18.994 --> 26:21.454
<i>It's a senseless
act of violence.</i>

26:21.454 --> 26:22.914
<i>Was it?</i>

26:25.292 --> 26:28.253
<i>I know violence
is a part of this family.</i>

26:28.253 --> 26:31.590
<i>Carlo killed someone.
Mom, her family...</i>

26:31.590 --> 26:33.592
<i>I know what people
think about them.</i>

26:33.592 --> 26:35.343
<i>I-I've heard the stories.</i>

26:35.343 --> 26:38.096
<i>They can't all be lies.</i>

26:38.096 --> 26:41.266
<i>They revel in it.</i>

26:42.809 --> 26:44.728
<i>But we're not like them.</i>

26:44.728 --> 26:46.271
<i>Right?</i>

26:47.981 --> 26:51.026
<i>So, how do you do what they do?</i>

27:05.415 --> 27:08.168
<i>Yeah, we've been
waiting for you.</i>

27:10.754 --> 27:12.589
Little later than expected.

27:17.510 --> 27:19.346
<i>But I knew</i>

27:19.346 --> 27:22.098
<i>your old Al Capone-looking
ass was coming.</i>

27:24.225 --> 27:26.144
<i>Search his ass.</i>

27:27.354 --> 27:29.189
<i>My problem isn't with you.</i>

27:31.107 --> 27:32.734
<i>But you're in my neighborhood.</i>

27:32.734 --> 27:35.737
<i>If you knew I was coming
you know who I'm looking for.</i>

27:35.737 --> 27:37.405
<i>And if you knew
how thin my patience was</i>

27:37.405 --> 27:38.823
<i>you'd shut the fuck up.</i>

27:38.823 --> 27:41.660
<i>See, you thought
you was gonna come down here</i>

27:41.660 --> 27:45.580
<i>and bust some heads open,
and almost got your wig split.</i>

27:46.665 --> 27:49.417
<i>Lucky for you,
those weren't my orders.</i>

27:50.335 --> 27:51.419
<i>Yet.</i>

27:52.879 --> 27:55.298
<i>To have the audacity</i>

27:55.298 --> 27:57.676
<i>to roll up on that house</i>

27:57.676 --> 28:00.220
<i>after the shit
your daddy pulled...</i>

28:01.805 --> 28:04.349
<i>Tell me one thing.</i>

28:04.349 --> 28:08.520
<i>He don't know that
you here now, do he?</i>

28:11.272 --> 28:13.525
<i>If anything happens to me--
- If?</i>

28:15.485 --> 28:18.655
<i>If "if" was a fifth,
we'd all be fucking drunk.</i>

28:19.197 --> 28:21.950
<i>Do you know what
my family will do to you?</i>

28:21.950 --> 28:24.327
<i>Well, shouldn't matter
to you now.</i>

28:24.327 --> 28:26.579
<i>You'd be long gone by then.</i>

28:51.062 --> 28:52.480
We're on our way home.

28:52.480 --> 28:55.817
<i>You asked me
if I had control over my men.</i>

28:55.817 --> 28:56.985
<i>Now I'm wondering</i>

28:56.985 --> 28:59.028
<i>if you got control over yours.</i>

28:59.028 --> 29:00.739
<i>What is this?</i>

29:00.739 --> 29:03.158
<i>If someone were to come around
looking for trouble,</i>

29:03.158 --> 29:06.494
<i>I should assume
you sent them, yeah?</i>

29:11.124 --> 29:14.043
<i>I got your son.</i>

29:16.504 --> 29:17.922
<i>Is that so?</i>

29:17.922 --> 29:20.258
<i>Mm.</i>

29:21.050 --> 29:23.386
<i>Like I said before,</i>

29:23.386 --> 29:26.139
<i>young men are so impulsive.</i>

29:28.141 --> 29:30.852
<i>You tread very carefully
right now.</i>

29:30.852 --> 29:34.481
<i>Oh, if I wanted to kill him
he'd be dead.</i>

29:34.481 --> 29:37.567
<i>But he came to my house uninvited,</i>

29:37.567 --> 29:39.819
<i>swinging around his little dick.</i>

29:39.819 --> 29:43.406
<i>But given our situation,</i>

29:43.406 --> 29:45.867
<i>I'm willing to overlook all that</i>

29:45.867 --> 29:48.953
<i>to avoid a war
that neither of us need.</i>

29:49.454 --> 29:52.415
<i>And in case
I didn't make it clear,</i>

29:52.415 --> 29:54.793
<i>this is a courtesy call.</i>

29:54.793 --> 29:56.961
<i>You handle your boy,</i>

29:56.961 --> 29:59.506
<i>I'll handle mine.</i>

30:14.854 --> 30:16.272
<i>Time's up, Little Man.</i>

30:16.272 --> 30:18.149
<i>ominous music</i>

30:38.837 --> 30:41.297
Carlo.

31:10.159 --> 31:11.786
<i>Wait...</i>

31:22.755 --> 31:25.508
<i>Hi, Mr. Desiato.
I don't know</i>

31:25.508 --> 31:26.885
<i>if you remember me--
- I do.</i>

31:26.885 --> 31:29.429
<i>I remember you, Fia.</i>

31:31.890 --> 31:33.516
<i>Are you okay?</i>

31:41.190 --> 31:44.235
<i>I write to you every month.</i>

31:44.235 --> 31:46.529
<i>I know.</i>

31:46.529 --> 31:49.032
<i>I have some questions.</i>

31:53.453 --> 31:56.331
<i>Did Adam love me?</i>

32:09.052 --> 32:10.511
<i>I don't know.</i>

32:11.304 --> 32:13.890
<i>There was a lot</i>

32:13.890 --> 32:17.018
<i>that we didn't get a chance
to talk about.</i>

32:18.978 --> 32:21.272
<i>Well, he and I
became very close.</i>

32:21.272 --> 32:24.192
<i>Maybe we can fill in
some of the missing pieces--</i>

32:24.192 --> 32:26.569
<i>No. No.</i>

32:26.569 --> 32:29.280
<i>No. I...</i>

32:29.280 --> 32:32.158
<i>I-I won't be able to help you.</i>

32:32.158 --> 32:34.619
<i>Look, I don't know</i>

32:34.619 --> 32:36.746
<i>if what Adam and I had
was the real thing</i>

32:36.746 --> 32:41.000
<i>or if it just seems that way
now because...</i>

32:57.308 --> 33:00.603
<i>Adam was a terrible liar.</i>

33:03.481 --> 33:06.484
<i>He didn't have that gift.</i>

33:06.484 --> 33:08.903
<i>So, if he told you
that he loved you,</i>

33:08.903 --> 33:11.990
<i>then it was true.
Now, please...</i>

33:13.366 --> 33:15.493
<i>...please, just
stay away from me.</i>

33:15.493 --> 33:17.578
<i>Please, can--</i>

33:24.794 --> 33:26.671
<i>slow, dramatic music</i>

33:40.518 --> 33:44.564
<i>Welcome, everybody, to
this year's annual prison rodeo!</i>

33:45.898 --> 33:47.692
<i>While y'all are
getting turned in,</i>

33:47.692 --> 33:49.193
<i>don't forget to visit
the concession stand</i>

33:49.193 --> 33:51.863
<i>and our three-dollar
pup-and-suds special.</i>

33:51.863 --> 33:54.032
<i>Cold beer and a nice hot dog.</i>

33:54.032 --> 33:55.533
<i>Get you started today.</i>

33:55.533 --> 33:59.537


33:59.537 --> 34:02.331
Whoa! [chortles]

34:02.331 --> 34:04.125
<i>No early parole for him.</i>

34:06.044 --> 34:08.671
<i>Inmates Morris, Waters,</i>

34:08.671 --> 34:12.425
<i>Jiménez and Desiato.</i>

34:17.180 --> 34:19.682
<i>And now the event

34:19.682 --> 34:22.560
<i>Who's ready for convict poker?</i>

34:22.560 --> 34:24.395
Yeah!

34:36.199 --> 34:37.909
<i>suspenseful music</i>

35:04.519 --> 35:06.395
<i>What are you doing
at this table, Judge?</i>

35:06.395 --> 35:08.064
<i>Huh?</i>

35:08.064 --> 35:10.274
<i>I'm here because I'm trying
to raise enough money</i>

35:10.274 --> 35:12.568
<i>so that my family don't starve.</i>

35:14.237 --> 35:15.446
<i>Just deal the cards.</i>

35:15.446 --> 35:17.156
<i>You gonna get yourself killed.</i>

35:17.156 --> 35:20.785
<i>All four contestants will play
a friendly game of cards.</i>

35:20.785 --> 35:23.454
<i>Last man to remain in his seat
wins a cash prize.</i>

35:23.454 --> 35:24.789
<i>May sound easy.</i>

35:24.789 --> 35:26.374
<i>Keep in mind,
they'll be doing it</i>

35:26.374 --> 35:29.877
<i>in the presence of
a one-ton bull named Malachi.</i>

35:57.155 --> 36:01.284
<i>Well, looks like
Malachi's taking his time</i>

36:01.284 --> 36:03.494
<i>assessing the situation.</i>

36:06.622 --> 36:09.041
Oh!

36:11.836 --> 36:14.046
<i>Who's it gonna be, folks?</i>

36:17.425 --> 36:19.844
<i>atmospheric music</i>

36:19.844 --> 36:22.847


36:23.848 --> 36:25.683


36:35.401 --> 36:37.695
<i>That boy
was on the horns of a dilemma</i>

36:37.695 --> 36:39.363
<i>for a bit, there.</i>

36:40.072 --> 36:43.784
<i>And we'll get him out of there.
We'll take care of him.</i>

36:58.007 --> 37:01.427
<i>Hey! Hey!
-</i>

37:01.427 --> 37:03.512
<i>Hey, boy, hey. Hey. Come on.</i>

37:03.512 --> 37:04.847
<i>Hey!
-</i>

37:04.847 --> 37:06.015
<i>Aah!</i>

37:06.015 --> 37:07.433


37:25.952 --> 37:27.370
<i>You know what
the fucked-up thing is, Judge?</i>

37:27.370 --> 37:28.829
<i>intense music</i>

37:28.829 --> 37:30.915
<i>It's got nothing to do with us.</i>

<i>The bull decides
who wins or loses.</i>

38:03.823 --> 38:06.117


38:12.164 --> 38:14.625
<i>Well, this looks like we</i>

38:14.625 --> 38:17.169
<i>got ourselves a winner, folks.</i>

38:17.169 --> 38:20.339
<i>How about that?</i>

38:34.729 --> 38:36.856
<i>Is there any word on the boy?</i>

38:38.107 --> 38:39.650
<i>No, not yet.</i>

38:39.650 --> 38:41.986
<i>Where's your sense of urgency?</i>

38:41.986 --> 38:44.071
<i>What would you have me do?
- How about</i>

38:44.071 --> 38:47.241
<i>we go back to the Lower Ninth
with more men</i>

38:47.241 --> 38:49.660
<i>and we go get
some goddamn answers!</i>

38:49.660 --> 38:52.663
<i>It's not a real plan, son.
It's barely even an idea.</i>

38:52.663 --> 38:54.457
<i>Dad, I--
- Think before you speak!</i>

38:54.457 --> 38:57.418
<i>Think before you act.</i>

38:57.418 --> 38:58.753
<i>Don't yell at him!</i>

38:58.753 --> 39:00.504
<i>He's trying
to protect this family.</i>

39:00.504 --> 39:03.799
<i>Look where it got him.
- Oh, so we do nothing?</i>

39:03.799 --> 39:05.134
<i>He was nearly killed.</i>

39:05.134 --> 39:07.470
<i>Doesn't that act
demand retaliation?</i>

39:07.470 --> 39:09.638
<i>That act was retaliation.</i>

39:18.481 --> 39:20.691
<i>Patience</i>

39:20.691 --> 39:23.235
<i>is not inaction.</i>

39:27.114 --> 39:30.910
<i>And violence is not
a demonstration of strength.</i>

40:26.841 --> 40:28.384
<i>Well, go on.</i>

40:32.680 --> 40:34.306
<i>There's an address in there.</i>

40:37.643 --> 40:40.104
<i>Stay gone, Little Man.</i>

41:07.673 --> 41:09.592
<i>Hey, yo, we here. Where you?</i>

41:09.592 --> 41:12.011
<i>We got a problem.</i>

41:13.012 --> 41:14.889
<i>Little Man got away.</i>

41:16.515 --> 41:18.434
<i>You got to be
fucking shitting me.</i>

41:20.144 --> 41:23.189
<i>I'm-a deal with you later.</i>

41:37.870 --> 41:39.622
<i>slow, ominous music</i>

42:00.768 --> 42:03.354
<i>This invitation
ain't include a plus-one.</i>

42:03.354 --> 42:07.858
<i>Sorry, but he outranks you
on this one.</i>

42:11.737 --> 42:15.115
<i>Adam Desiato was my godson.</i>

42:15.115 --> 42:17.618
<i>I want to be here
when Rudy brings in the killer.</i>

42:20.496 --> 42:22.206
<i>He in there?</i>

42:22.998 --> 42:24.625
<i>Yeah, he's gone.</i>

42:27.044 --> 42:29.463
<i>You told me
I was getting the shooter.</i>

42:30.047 --> 42:33.926
<i>You think I'm-a hand over
a young Black boy to the police?</i>

42:33.926 --> 42:37.346
<i>So, we're out of agenda items.</i>

42:40.140 --> 42:42.685
<i>I'm done here.
- That's fine,</i>

42:42.685 --> 42:45.771
<i>but you walking away don't
make our problems disappear.</i>

42:45.771 --> 42:48.107
<i>Our problems?</i>

42:48.107 --> 42:51.443
<i>Yeah. Our problems.</i>

42:51.443 --> 42:53.445
<i>I got Baxters
with itchy trigger fingers</i>

42:53.445 --> 42:56.198
<i>and NOPD on every goddamn block
of my neighborhood.</i>

42:56.198 --> 42:59.243
<i>And you, Mr. Figaro,</i>

42:59.243 --> 43:02.580
<i>you need voters to feel...</i>

43:02.580 --> 43:06.041
<i>safe when they go to cast
they votes next week, yeah?</i>

43:06.792 --> 43:09.086
Seems to me, every one

43:09.086 --> 43:11.422
<i>of our problems disappears</i>

43:11.422 --> 43:14.508
<i>if you hand over Eugene Jones.</i>

43:15.384 --> 43:18.095
<i>Am I not making myself clear?</i>

43:18.095 --> 43:19.930
<i>All we need is a solved crime.</i>

43:19.930 --> 43:24.101
<i>Rudy here finds another body,</i>

43:24.101 --> 43:27.688
<i>one that can't talk,
to stand in for my guy.</i>

43:27.688 --> 43:29.607
<i>What am I supposed to do--</i>

43:29.607 --> 43:33.110
<i>just find a random body
at the body store?</i>

43:33.110 --> 43:35.654
<i>Yeah. Ain't never
stopped y'all before.</i>

43:38.324 --> 43:41.201
<i>You declare the city safe.</i>

43:42.202 --> 43:43.579
<i>And I make for damn sure</i>

43:43.579 --> 43:46.165
<i>Eugene Jones is never
heard from again.</i>

43:49.001 --> 43:51.128
<i>Well, what do you say,
Detective?</i>

43:51.128 --> 43:53.380
<i>Want to solve
the case of the year?</i>

43:59.637 --> 44:01.138
<i>It's Eugene's.</i>

44:01.138 --> 44:02.598
<i>He'd have it on him.</i>

44:43.055 --> 44:46.600
<i>Well, if it's any consolation,
the bull was denied parole.</i>

44:54.233 --> 44:56.068
<i>I've secured your release.</i>

44:56.068 --> 44:57.861
<i>Yeah, well...</i>

44:57.861 --> 45:00.656
<i>I'm still not helping you
get Jimmy Baxter.</i>

45:00.656 --> 45:03.784
<i>I can understand
why you wouldn't do it for me.</i>

45:03.784 --> 45:06.453
<i>But I think you should do it
for Charlie Figaro.</i>

45:06.453 --> 45:08.455
<i>Why?</i>

45:08.455 --> 45:10.666
<i>Because he could
be in a lot of trouble.</i>

45:10.666 --> 45:12.918
<i>And if you help me,</i>

45:12.918 --> 45:15.587
<i>I can make his problems go away.</i>

45:16.171 --> 45:20.551
<i>I'm not doing anything for you
until I know why.</i>

45:26.265 --> 45:29.476
<i>How did you
get Kofi Jones to steal the car?</i>

45:29.476 --> 45:32.813
I called Charlie.

45:32.813 --> 45:34.314
Charlie Figaro?

45:34.314 --> 45:37.234
Yes.

45:37.234 --> 45:40.404
<i>I told him
I needed the car gone.</i>

45:41.947 --> 45:44.408
<i>And he took care of it.</i>

45:49.079 --> 45:50.914
<i>Now, I imagine</i>

45:50.914 --> 45:54.418
<i>if you had all your faculties
intact in that moment,</i>

45:54.418 --> 45:57.129
<i>you would have never
implicated your best friend.</i>

45:57.129 --> 46:00.132
<i>But this right here--</i>

46:00.132 --> 46:02.384
<i>this is the end of his career.</i>

46:02.384 --> 46:04.261
<i>This is prison time.</i>

46:06.221 --> 46:09.099
<i>He helped you
in your hour of need.</i>

46:14.772 --> 46:17.441
<i>He's 19.
That's the youngest I've got.</i>

46:18.025 --> 46:22.154
<i>We don't get a lot of children
that go unclaimed.</i>

46:23.405 --> 46:25.115
<i>They don't look anything alike.</i>

46:25.115 --> 46:27.284
<i>I don't control the inventory.</i>

46:29.495 --> 46:31.955
<i>But...</i>

46:31.955 --> 46:34.541
<i>he has gunshot wound
to the face ought to help.</i>

46:49.014 --> 46:51.475
<i>All right, Eugene.</i>

46:54.019 --> 46:56.480
<i>Okay. Thanks.</i>

46:58.232 --> 46:59.483
<i>Looks like his own people</i>

46:59.483 --> 47:01.693
<i>shot him in the head
down by the lake.</i>

47:03.362 --> 47:05.864
Now, for a lot of us,

47:05.864 --> 47:08.992
<i>the words "New Orleans"</i>

47:08.992 --> 47:11.161
<i>have always sounded like home.</i>

47:13.080 --> 47:15.958
<i>This city is one big family,</i>

47:15.958 --> 47:18.043
<i>and we take care of our own.</i>

47:18.043 --> 47:19.503
That's right.

47:19.503 --> 47:22.130
<i>Even when a-a brutal murder</i>

47:22.130 --> 47:24.091
<i>threatens to tear us apart,</i>

47:24.091 --> 47:26.468
<i>we finds a way to come together.</i>

47:26.468 --> 47:29.304
<i>Thanks to the tireless work</i>

47:29.304 --> 47:31.265
<i>of our police officers,</i>

47:31.265 --> 47:33.517
<i>and to the cooperation</i>

47:33.517 --> 47:36.270
<i>of decent and ordinary citizens,</i>

47:36.270 --> 47:38.939
<i>the perpetrator has been found</i>

47:38.939 --> 47:40.941
<i>and is no longer!</i>

47:42.192 --> 47:44.862
<i>I said, "No longer a threat!"</i>

47:44.862 --> 47:47.030
<i>If I am elected,</i>

47:47.030 --> 47:49.491
<i>I will dedicate my mayorship</i>

47:49.491 --> 47:52.995
<i>to the memory of my godson,
-</i>

47:52.995 --> 47:55.831
<i>Adam Desiato.</i>

47:55.831 --> 48:00.002
<i>Our search for the perpetrator
of this crime was swift,</i>

48:00.002 --> 48:03.005
<i>though our security
may have been shaken,</i>

48:03.005 --> 48:06.508
<i>our resolve remains strong.</i>

48:06.508 --> 48:08.760
<i>Let us never forget</i>

48:08.760 --> 48:12.180
<i>that this city belongs
to all of her children.</i>

48:12.180 --> 48:14.016
<i>haunting music</i>

48:17.060 --> 48:18.854
Mr. Desiato,

48:18.854 --> 48:21.064
<i>I know that in all likelihood
you'll never read this,</i>

48:21.064 --> 48:24.151
<i>but I feel I have to
write this letter anyway.</i>

48:24.151 --> 48:26.695
<i>I realize now that
I never really knew Adam.</i>

48:26.695 --> 48:29.031
<i>But I feel I owe it to him...</i>

48:30.949 --> 48:32.409
<i>haunting music</i>

48:32.409 --> 48:34.202
<i>Hey. I got you.</i>

48:51.970 --> 48:54.097
<i>Hey, Dad.
- Hey.</i>

49:36.848 --> 49:38.308
<i>Yes?</i>

49:38.892 --> 49:40.852
<i>You made
a good decision, Michael.</i>

49:40.852 --> 49:43.230
<i>I'll be in touch.
-</i>

49:43.230 --> 49:44.982
<i>contemplative music</i>
