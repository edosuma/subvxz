WEBVTT

00:15.720 --> 00:20.640
Strong leadership, dynamic vision,
the ability to inspire. I tick every box.

00:21.480 --> 00:25.680
Weak leaders just get taken advantage of.
Not on my watch.

00:28.560 --> 00:29.960
Where's my watch?

00:46.160 --> 00:47.480
Has anyone seen a watch?

00:58.120 --> 01:01.320
And the cameras are going
to be with us all the time…

01:01.400 --> 01:03.200
-Whoo!
-…which will be a little strange

01:03.280 --> 01:05.240
at first, I'm sure, for all of us.

01:05.320 --> 01:09.400
-Are we gonna be on the telly, miss?
-I expect that is the general idea, yes.

01:11.080 --> 01:14.440
This pilot scheme to mount a musical,

01:14.520 --> 01:18.400
<i>West Side Story</i> , no less,
is an incredible opportunity.

01:18.480 --> 01:23.280
-I'm excited, and I'm excited for you.
-Is that one of your artsy ideas, miss?

01:23.360 --> 01:26.520
Too many people think they know
who prison inmates are

01:26.600 --> 01:30.000
and what prison life is like,
without ever setting foot inside one.

01:30.080 --> 01:31.120
-Yeah.
-Too right.

01:31.200 --> 01:32.880
So, let's put the record straight.

01:32.960 --> 01:37.360
Let's break some misconceptions.
Let's smash some stereotypes.

01:37.960 --> 01:40.360
Be yourselves. You've got nothing to hide.

01:40.440 --> 01:45.200
-She has. She's just nicked your watch!

01:45.280 --> 01:49.320
You are being given the chance
to do something truly creative

01:49.400 --> 01:53.840
while challenging yourself
and having your voices heard, literally.

01:53.920 --> 01:56.080
-Can we do <i>Annie</i> ?
-Just let me finish.

01:56.160 --> 01:58.680
We've got a surprise director coming in.

01:58.760 --> 02:01.880
The research is out there,
the data has spoken,

02:01.960 --> 02:06.080
so remember, creativity leads to…

02:06.160 --> 02:08.520
rehabilitation.

02:08.600 --> 02:11.240
-Thank you.
-What about <i>Dirty Dancing</i> ?

02:11.320 --> 02:12.840
-<i>Hamilton</i> !
-I like <i>Phantom</i> .

02:12.920 --> 02:15.759
-<i>The King and I</i> .
-What about <i>Mary Poppins</i> ?

02:15.840 --> 02:16.840
-<i>Dreamgirls</i> !
-Okay.

02:16.920 --> 02:18.240
Yes!

02:18.320 --> 02:20.960
Not up for discussion,
we're doing <i>West Side Story</i> ,

02:21.040 --> 02:24.640
so get your names down
and start singing! Thank you.

02:24.720 --> 02:27.240
-Do you fancy the cameraman, miss?
-Oh!

02:27.320 --> 02:28.320
No.

02:30.760 --> 02:33.000
Can someone get my watch back, please?

02:33.520 --> 02:34.560
Sorry.

02:44.520 --> 02:47.440
-Well, it don't look clean!

02:47.520 --> 02:48.520
Ooh.

02:49.640 --> 02:52.160
-Someone's getting their hair did.
-Yeah, I know.

02:52.240 --> 02:55.440
What have I told you
about laying those edges though, boo?

02:55.520 --> 02:58.120
You're not allowed no more.
Twitter said so.

02:59.200 --> 03:00.640
She can do it.

03:00.720 --> 03:02.040
So can she.

03:02.120 --> 03:04.520
She probably could,
but it'd look ridiculous.

03:04.600 --> 03:06.880
This one definitely can't. You had that?

03:07.520 --> 03:09.840
Pretend Parker Bowles,
that's a look-a-likey.

03:09.920 --> 03:12.000
Serial shoplifter. Couldn't make it up.

03:12.080 --> 03:13.880
<i>She's an absolute beast.</i>

03:16.360 --> 03:21.000
You can't be doing that either, boos.
That is cultural appropriation.

03:21.080 --> 03:22.080
We got bored.

03:22.160 --> 03:24.600
Well, tell that to the court
of public opinion.

03:24.680 --> 03:27.280
If Adele can't do it,
I don't see how you can.

03:28.800 --> 03:31.960
Elizabeth Fry,
the great prison reformer, once said,

03:32.040 --> 03:35.600
"It is an honor
to be on the side of the afflicted."

03:36.440 --> 03:38.200
I say, "Hear, hear."

03:39.120 --> 03:40.520
Except the murderers.

03:41.240 --> 03:42.920
And the pedophiles.

03:43.000 --> 03:44.680
Most sex offenders.

03:44.760 --> 03:46.360
All sex offenders.

03:47.560 --> 03:48.800
But…

03:48.880 --> 03:51.000
all the others, I'm right behind.

03:58.440 --> 03:59.800
Put it down there.

04:03.120 --> 04:04.160
Name?

04:05.400 --> 04:06.520
Angela Brookes.

04:06.600 --> 04:08.960
Sign and date there for your belongings.

04:13.400 --> 04:15.880
Is this your first time in prison, Angela?

04:16.520 --> 04:17.520
Yeah.

04:18.160 --> 04:20.320
Well, you'll settle in.

04:22.519 --> 04:24.000
Right, come on. This way.

04:35.440 --> 04:39.480
Did I set out to be governor
of a women's prison? I did not.

04:40.280 --> 04:43.000
Was this the tier-one dream? No.

04:43.080 --> 04:45.120
Was it the tier-two dream? Barely.

04:45.840 --> 04:49.080
But I'm not the kinda person
who walks away from a challenge,

04:49.160 --> 04:51.240
and when one's head is hunted,

04:51.320 --> 04:54.720
one sticks it firmly on the pike
and marches into battle.

04:55.560 --> 04:57.560
I was headhunted from my previous job.

04:57.640 --> 04:59.640
-In events.
-Yes.

04:59.720 --> 05:02.480
-Thank you, Dean. That's Dean.
-I'm her number two.

05:02.560 --> 05:05.200
-Not that I need one.
-You don't need a number two?

05:05.280 --> 05:06.920
I've never needed a number two.

05:07.480 --> 05:09.760
Laura came through
the back door of nepotism

05:09.840 --> 05:12.000
and got promoted through over confidence.

05:12.080 --> 05:15.080
Governor of the prison?
We know what this is.

05:15.160 --> 05:16.760
Positive discrimination.

05:16.840 --> 05:19.080
She got the job just 'cause she's a woman,

05:19.160 --> 05:23.200
and I'm now spending my days trying
to get her to say "number two" on camera.

05:23.280 --> 05:26.040
It's a small victory for overqualified men
in the workplace everywhere.

05:29.760 --> 05:31.320
You know what?

05:31.400 --> 05:33.840
You all right?
I can see what's happened here.

05:33.920 --> 05:35.440
What's happened here?

05:36.560 --> 05:38.360
-What, my bump?
-Yeah.

05:38.440 --> 05:40.960
-Pregnancy, innit?
-Pregnancy and in jail?

05:41.760 --> 05:43.240
Parents must be proud.

05:44.840 --> 05:47.440
-I told you I didn't want this.

05:47.520 --> 05:48.920
What is it today?

05:49.000 --> 05:51.320
Shit. Why don't we never have tacos?

05:51.840 --> 05:55.800
Tacos and tacos. Tacos and tacos.

05:55.880 --> 05:57.880
-First day?
-Yeah.

05:57.960 --> 05:59.280
Aw.

06:05.160 --> 06:06.640
Do I need to know how many days?

06:06.720 --> 06:09.880
Do you just sit up in bed all night
and compile loads of questions--

06:09.960 --> 06:12.880
For goodness sake, Doug! Every time!

06:12.960 --> 06:14.840
Laura, you really need to make a decision.

06:14.920 --> 06:18.960
Yes, I know. Plumbing.
General maintenance, etcetera, etcetera.

06:19.040 --> 06:20.960
-Thank you, Douglas.
-It's important.

06:21.720 --> 06:26.160
I spy with my little eye
something beginning with "new inmate."

06:26.240 --> 06:28.040
First timer?

06:28.560 --> 06:29.560
Probably not.

06:29.640 --> 06:32.440
I'm Laura Willis. I'm the governor.

06:32.520 --> 06:35.360
And I want you to know,
your crime is of no importance to me.

06:35.440 --> 06:36.880
-Good. Because I'm not--
-I don't need to know.

06:36.960 --> 06:38.800
-Well, look, I think you should--
-Ah, ah, ah.

06:38.880 --> 06:42.280
-I am not judging you on your worst day.
-I'm not an inmate.

06:42.360 --> 06:43.680
Well, you are.

06:43.760 --> 06:47.160
But you start afresh right here,
right now. The slate is clean.

06:47.240 --> 06:48.360
I'm Cheryl Fergison.

06:48.440 --> 06:52.080
That's the spirit, Cheryl Fergison.
Welcome.

06:54.880 --> 06:56.880
You're Cheryl Fergison.

06:57.880 --> 06:59.280
That's exactly who you are.

06:59.360 --> 07:02.040
Ex-soap star, not a prisoner.

07:02.120 --> 07:06.120
Well, a prisoner of your own talents.
I'm so sorry I didn't recognize you.

07:06.200 --> 07:09.320
-You look nothing like your photo.
-What? This photo?

07:10.560 --> 07:11.720
Is that you?

07:11.800 --> 07:12.880
Yes.

07:13.520 --> 07:14.960
Wowza.

07:15.760 --> 07:18.640
So, <i>West Side Story</i> . Very exciting.

07:18.720 --> 07:22.160
Let me know if you need anything from me,
but I don't think you'll have any problem.

07:22.240 --> 07:25.400
-What do you mean?
-You know, just fitting in.

07:25.480 --> 07:27.800
You know, all this.

07:27.880 --> 07:30.080
This will all be… beneficial.

07:30.160 --> 07:32.560
-Why?
-'Cause just…

07:33.600 --> 07:34.800
Everything works.

07:34.880 --> 07:37.280
This your guard? Do you want a bigger one?

07:37.360 --> 07:38.640
Do you even need one?

07:38.720 --> 07:40.480
I mean, well, she's here now, so…

07:40.560 --> 07:44.040
Go on, off you go. Drum up some business!

07:44.120 --> 07:45.960
Good luck! You won't need it.

07:46.040 --> 07:48.000
See you, Cheryl.
I meant to say, I'm a big fan.

07:48.080 --> 07:49.960
I'm Dean, by the way. Laura's number two.

07:50.040 --> 07:51.520
Wasn't my choice!

07:51.600 --> 07:55.440
To keep the prison board happy,
I was forced to have a number two.

08:01.640 --> 08:05.600
Musicals? In prison? Hell to the yes.

08:05.680 --> 08:08.080
No creativity, no rehabilitation.

08:08.160 --> 08:11.520
Which, incidentally,
is the upcoming subject of my TED talk.

08:11.600 --> 08:12.760
What's that called again?

08:12.840 --> 08:14.880
"I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings:

08:14.960 --> 08:17.560
How Women in Prison Thrive
through Music and Song."

08:17.640 --> 08:19.520
-When's that happening then?
-No date set.

08:19.600 --> 08:21.880
-So, never.
-It's upcoming.

08:21.960 --> 08:26.320
Anyway, that is why
I've asked Cheryl Fergison,

08:26.400 --> 08:30.880
aka Ms. Heather Trott,
to come and direct <i>West Side Story</i> .

08:30.960 --> 08:34.080
-Not an obvious choice.
-Not her first rodeo.

08:34.160 --> 08:38.240
As it turns out, Cheryl has lots
of experience working with prisoners

08:38.320 --> 08:41.600
doing drama workshops and whatnot.

08:41.679 --> 08:43.440
When does she have time
for all her rodeos?

08:43.520 --> 08:46.159
She's also a well-loved face
from stage and screen,

08:46.240 --> 08:48.440
which everyone will be excited about.

08:49.000 --> 08:53.240
Big shout going out
to the <i>EastEnders</i> massive.

08:54.040 --> 08:56.960
I've never seen it.
It's a popular soap opera about Cockneys.

09:12.920 --> 09:15.040
Yes, I was on <i>EastEnders</i> ,

09:15.120 --> 09:17.720
which does make you very recognizable.

09:17.800 --> 09:21.520
But people move on,
as have I, as have the audience.

09:21.600 --> 09:23.400
The public see me as a versatile actress

09:23.480 --> 09:25.560
rather than a character
I once played on a soap.

09:25.640 --> 09:28.320
All right, Heather? Thought you were dead.

09:29.680 --> 09:31.560
I'm Gary, by the way.

09:33.160 --> 09:34.520
Soap royalty.

09:36.000 --> 09:37.880
Calm down, Gary. She's only human.

09:39.560 --> 09:41.360
I'll be all right in a minute.

09:42.240 --> 09:43.920
It's just a great day.

09:44.480 --> 09:46.240
What do you like most
about Cheryl, Gaz?

09:46.320 --> 09:48.360
The way she just floats
through the scenes.

09:48.440 --> 09:51.040
She floats convincingly, don't she?

09:52.280 --> 09:55.840
The nature of her floating is authentic.

09:56.560 --> 09:57.560
Yeah.

09:58.040 --> 10:01.080
And <i>EastEnders</i> needed her
at that time as well, because…

10:01.160 --> 10:02.400
Big time.

10:03.280 --> 10:04.720
-Saved it.
-Saved it.

10:05.280 --> 10:06.640
-Saved it.
-Saved it.

10:13.240 --> 10:15.200
Do you know the most important factor
in not reoffending?

10:15.280 --> 10:16.280
Stable home life.

10:17.000 --> 10:20.480
Is it? Do you know
the other most important factor?

10:20.560 --> 10:22.000
-Regular employment?
-Shall I tell you?

10:22.080 --> 10:23.320
-Sure.
-Creativity.

10:23.400 --> 10:25.680
-This about your little musical project?
-Creativity,

10:25.760 --> 10:27.600
a sense of purpose, self-esteem.

10:27.680 --> 10:29.560
And my "little musical project"--

10:29.640 --> 10:32.000
government-funded scheme
soon to be rolled out nationally--

10:32.080 --> 10:33.880
is a step in the right direction.

10:33.960 --> 10:35.160
And if I know these women,

10:35.240 --> 10:39.000
they will run towards this opportunity
and leap into its arms.

10:39.840 --> 10:42.400
-All right, ladies. How are we doing?

10:42.480 --> 10:44.080
Oh, my God!

10:47.080 --> 10:48.480
Oh, my God! I'm so excited!

10:51.800 --> 10:55.200
It's fantastic to be here.
Who's up for a bit of <i>West Side Story</i> ?

10:55.280 --> 10:57.160
-Me!
-It's a story of two rival gangs,

10:57.240 --> 11:00.600
-so some of you might enjoy that aspect.
-You know who you are, boos.

11:00.680 --> 11:03.280
There'll be proper rehearsals,
we'll bring in an orchestra.

11:03.360 --> 11:05.240
And at the end,
we'll put on a banging show

11:05.320 --> 11:07.200
that your friends and family
can come and see.

11:07.280 --> 11:08.520
This one's killed all hers.

11:08.600 --> 11:11.320
Right! Well, as you may or may not know,
my name is--

11:11.400 --> 11:13.880
-Heather Trott!

11:13.960 --> 11:15.280
It's Cheryl Fergison.

11:15.360 --> 11:16.360
Get outta my pub!

11:16.440 --> 11:18.120
-Yeah! Yeah!

11:18.200 --> 11:20.640
-Thought you was dead, Heather.
-Who killed you, again?

11:20.720 --> 11:24.200
-So, a little bit about me.
-You're Heather Trott!

11:25.240 --> 11:26.760
Trott, Trott, Trott, Trott, Trotter!

11:29.720 --> 11:30.720
Are you finished?

11:52.240 --> 11:55.120
-I think they're finished now, boo.

11:55.200 --> 11:57.520
Sorry, I'm a bit confused.

11:57.600 --> 11:59.760
I've given up my time
to do something nice for you,

11:59.840 --> 12:02.560
and it appears that you're treating me
like a bit of a mug.

12:02.640 --> 12:04.720
So, don't do that, 'cause I'm not.

12:04.800 --> 12:06.160
And here's the dealio.

12:06.240 --> 12:08.520
Join in, don't join in,
makes no odds to me.

12:08.600 --> 12:13.760
Just remember a couple of things.
One, don't be a cunt. And two, that's it.

12:16.720 --> 12:17.960
Mike drop.

12:19.840 --> 12:22.120
Well, I do, Dean.
I reject the whole concept.

12:22.200 --> 12:25.040
-Of having a number two?
-I see it as a form of weakness.

12:25.120 --> 12:29.520
As governor of this prison,
the last thing I need people to see

12:29.600 --> 12:32.080
is an insipid little number two
trailing behind me.

12:32.160 --> 12:35.640
If you've finished, could we please
have a conversation about--

12:35.720 --> 12:37.880
Plumbing? Plumbing?

12:37.960 --> 12:40.160
Well, it's actually quite serious, so if--

12:40.240 --> 12:43.160
Hello? Oh. I'm sorry, Doug,
I'm gonna have to take this.

12:44.080 --> 12:46.040
Oh, Doug. I'm only joking.

12:47.120 --> 12:52.120
Doug and I basically want the same thing.
We want to improve this prison.

12:53.000 --> 12:56.880
Now, Doug's interpretation of that
is something about fixing the plumbing,

12:56.960 --> 12:59.160
whereas I focus more on artistic endeavor,

12:59.240 --> 13:02.680
and let's be honest, what's more important
in the day-to-day life of an inmate?

13:02.760 --> 13:04.440
Could it be plumbing?

13:04.520 --> 13:06.840
So, with that in mind,

13:06.920 --> 13:10.360
I have invested in personalized…
librettos.

13:11.240 --> 13:13.760
Hand printed on cream parchment

13:13.840 --> 13:16.240
for every member
of the <i>West Side Story</i> cast.

13:16.320 --> 13:18.560
Government funding
didn't quite stretch to that,

13:18.640 --> 13:20.560
so what's a gal to do?

13:20.640 --> 13:22.240
She finds it somewhere else!

13:22.320 --> 13:23.960
What's a libretto?

13:24.040 --> 13:28.200
A… libretto
is the extended text of a vocal work.

13:28.280 --> 13:31.560
-Do you mean the words to the songs?
-Expensive? Yes.

13:31.640 --> 13:33.760
Worth it? Most definitely.

13:35.120 --> 13:37.200
-What else are prison budgets for?
-Plumbing.

13:37.280 --> 13:39.640
-What could improve their lives more?
-Plumbing.

13:39.720 --> 13:45.320
Do you know how many other women's prisons
have invested in handbound librettos

13:45.400 --> 13:47.720
of the greatest musical
of the 20th century?

13:47.800 --> 13:48.800
-None?
-None.

13:51.040 --> 13:52.960
I like Laura, I do,

13:53.040 --> 13:54.960
but, uh, she doesn't make it easy, though.

13:55.440 --> 13:58.560
She rarely listens, she won't take advice.

13:59.040 --> 14:02.320
I think she's quite forgetful,
and if there's a problem…

14:02.400 --> 14:04.960
-If I want an idiot…
-…she's usually the cause of it.

14:05.040 --> 14:07.240
Last year the electrics needed rewiring.

14:07.320 --> 14:10.120
Instead she chose to install nature walls

14:10.200 --> 14:14.480
to promote a sense of calm
and improve vibes generally.

14:14.560 --> 14:17.120
-Oh, you fuck off! Yeah, yeah…
-You fuck off!

14:17.200 --> 14:20.680
Didn't work.
But you just can't help liking her.

14:21.360 --> 14:23.960
-Oh, sorry to disturb you. Good moment?
-All right.

14:24.040 --> 14:26.360
-Um, do you like dancing and stuff?
-No, not really.

14:26.440 --> 14:27.920
Oh, you don't like dancing.
What about singing?

14:28.000 --> 14:30.200
-No.
-Well, can I put you down for costumes?

14:30.280 --> 14:31.960
-In what?
-Do you want to be in a musical?

14:32.040 --> 14:33.080
-Yeah.
-Great. Okay.

14:33.160 --> 14:34.560
Okay. I'll put you down then, yeah?

14:34.640 --> 14:36.320
-All right, cheers then.
-Thanks.

14:37.000 --> 14:38.320
Ladies, we're doing a musical.

14:38.400 --> 14:40.440
I was wondering if I could put you down
for something?

14:40.520 --> 14:42.600
Some singing, some dancing, some-- Any--

14:53.240 --> 14:54.440
Great.

14:57.880 --> 14:59.200
<i>What are we?</i>

14:59.280 --> 15:00.640
Gay for the stay.

15:01.240 --> 15:03.720
I mean, it's not for everyone,
late onset lesbianism.

15:03.800 --> 15:05.840
But my goodness, we're giving it a go.

15:09.240 --> 15:10.560
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

15:10.640 --> 15:12.760
So, uh, are you up for it?

15:13.560 --> 15:15.680
-Yeah.
-What about you, my love?

15:15.760 --> 15:18.120
I've heard I'll get out
of a load of shit stuff if I do it,

15:18.200 --> 15:19.760
so I might as well.

15:19.840 --> 15:22.240
Unless it's shit. And then I'll stop.

15:22.840 --> 15:24.880
Oh, right. That's the spirit.

15:24.960 --> 15:27.240
<i>West Side Story</i> ? That sounds boring,

15:27.320 --> 15:28.720
like all her ideas.

15:28.800 --> 15:32.200
Boring, pointless,
badly executed, benefiting no one.

15:32.280 --> 15:33.840
So these are my choices:

15:33.920 --> 15:37.200
singing <i>olde worlde</i> songs
about Sharks and Jet Skis or something,

15:37.280 --> 15:40.440
or finishing my boring parenting course
for a baby I don't even want.

15:40.520 --> 15:42.040
There's not much in it, really.

15:43.440 --> 15:46.160
All right, what about you then?
You tempted?

15:46.760 --> 15:48.720
It's something to do
for the next six weeks, innit?

15:48.800 --> 15:52.040
Oh, gosh, no, no,
I'm not cut out for that sort of thing.

15:52.120 --> 15:56.040
Um, also, I'm just in on remand.
Just waiting for my trial date.

15:56.120 --> 15:58.520
My lawyer says I won't be in here
that long, anyway.

15:58.600 --> 16:00.600
I don't see how I can be,
because I didn't do it.

16:00.680 --> 16:01.920
We all didn't do it, love!

16:02.000 --> 16:03.760
No, but I re-- I really didn't do it.

16:03.840 --> 16:07.560
Well, if your trial turns into a sentence,
you know where to find me.

16:07.640 --> 16:09.080
Hey there, Cheryl!

16:09.640 --> 16:12.800
I want be a part of that.
Put me on the list. My name's Sian.

16:14.320 --> 16:15.480
Bit weird in here, innit?

16:15.560 --> 16:17.240
We don't say, "weird."

16:17.760 --> 16:18.960
We say, "Welsh."

16:19.600 --> 16:21.000
Sian is from Wales.

16:21.080 --> 16:24.000
That beautiful country
that borders England to the west.

16:24.080 --> 16:25.160
Not the mammal.

16:25.240 --> 16:28.080
She speaks with the rich melody
of her motherland.

16:28.160 --> 16:30.480
It's just a shame
no one knows what she's saying.

16:30.560 --> 16:32.720
So, when she requested
full traditional costume

16:32.800 --> 16:36.080
to feel closer to her Celtic heritage,
I was happy to oblige.

16:36.160 --> 16:37.800
At least,
I think that's what she asked for.

16:40.320 --> 16:42.560
Only went
to ask for a hypoallergenic pillow.

16:43.160 --> 16:44.840
And she gave me this.

16:44.920 --> 16:46.720
I'm still all bunged up.

16:52.440 --> 16:54.920
-Is it ice cream?
-Yeah, but it's shit.

16:55.920 --> 16:58.240
Why can't we ever have Cornettos?

17:02.760 --> 17:05.400
-Why are you not joining in the singing?
-Um…

17:05.480 --> 17:08.040
-What have you got against Cornettos?
-Nothing, I just don't know the words.

17:08.120 --> 17:10.160
-Oh, that's convenient.
-What?

17:10.240 --> 17:12.079
-Why are you shouting?
-I'm not, I--

17:12.160 --> 17:13.839
Be careful.

17:25.960 --> 17:26.960
Heather!

17:27.560 --> 17:28.560
Heather!

17:28.640 --> 17:30.560
Is there going to be an audience
for your show, Heather?

17:30.640 --> 17:32.480
Is there going to be people watching
at the end, like?

17:32.560 --> 17:35.440
Because if there is, I'll be in it,
and me mammy will come see it.

17:35.520 --> 17:37.520
This one's for my mammy.

17:37.600 --> 17:41.480
That's why it says "Mammy".
Are you watching that one on your camera?

17:41.560 --> 17:43.000
Like.

17:43.080 --> 17:44.760
That one. I've got loads of 'em.

17:44.840 --> 17:47.920
I get-- I get them when I'm happy.
I get them when I'm sad.

17:48.520 --> 17:50.760
When they locked my mammy up
for the first time,

17:50.840 --> 17:52.600
I couldn't cry, I was too numb.

17:53.360 --> 17:54.920
So, I got that one.

17:55.000 --> 17:56.640
And the pain of the needle was so bad

17:56.720 --> 17:58.640
that the tears came
and they wouldn't stop.

17:59.640 --> 18:02.320
They call it a cathartic experience
or some shite.

18:02.400 --> 18:05.320
I think that's all bollocks,
I just like having pictures on my arm.

18:05.400 --> 18:07.520
That's the one I got. There.

18:07.600 --> 18:08.920
Birds.

18:09.000 --> 18:11.880
That was supposed to be me,
but it didn't turn out right.

18:12.640 --> 18:14.000
Will I do a tattoo on you?

18:14.840 --> 18:15.960
I'll get my needle.

18:16.520 --> 18:17.920
You've got none on your arm.

18:18.680 --> 18:21.240
That's great.
That's just, like, fresh meat.

18:21.320 --> 18:23.200
I just go "pew-pew-pew-pew-pew".

18:23.280 --> 18:25.960
Pffft… with the blood.

18:26.040 --> 18:27.440
'Cause I'm not very good.

18:27.520 --> 18:31.320
What's it like being on the TV?
Did you like being on the TV?

18:31.400 --> 18:33.040
Did they call you Heather all the time?

18:33.120 --> 18:35.520
-What is your real name again?
-It's Cheryl.

18:35.600 --> 18:39.840
That's nice. I'm Ros.
Write that down in your book there.

18:39.920 --> 18:41.600
Is it R-O-S or R-O-Z?

18:41.680 --> 18:43.200
I don't know, I can't read.

18:46.000 --> 18:47.640
Yeah, that looks grand.

18:48.120 --> 18:50.040
Heather, it…

18:50.120 --> 18:51.760
Cheryl…

18:51.840 --> 18:55.480
Me girl will be in it and all,
but she don't speak, so she can't sing.

18:57.160 --> 18:58.320
Cheryl.

18:58.400 --> 19:00.840
Viv. I'm a natural-born entertainer.

19:00.920 --> 19:04.560
I'm also incredibly violent
and singing is my happy place.

19:04.640 --> 19:06.440
So look no further.

19:10.360 --> 19:11.840
I do impressions.

19:11.920 --> 19:15.280
Gordon Ramsay,
Ellen DeGeneres, Graham Norton,

19:15.360 --> 19:17.000
whoever it is does <i>The One Show</i> .

19:17.080 --> 19:19.200
All the Kardashians, except the old one.

19:19.280 --> 19:22.280
I can do them all.
And I can do them all fucking well.

19:22.360 --> 19:25.360
And if anyone says any different,
I'll fucking kill 'em.

19:25.440 --> 19:27.360
I'm excited.

19:29.280 --> 19:31.040
That was one of the Kardashians.

19:31.640 --> 19:33.520
That was-- That was really good, Viv.

19:33.600 --> 19:34.920
-Yeah.
-That was brilliant.

19:35.000 --> 19:36.280
I know.

19:50.000 --> 19:51.920
So you say… libretto.

19:52.000 --> 19:55.160
Out of curiosity, how would you say that?

19:55.760 --> 19:58.200
-"Barthelona."
-Barcelona, that's great.

19:59.240 --> 20:00.720
What about this one?

20:01.320 --> 20:03.000
-Cappuccino.
-Cappuccino.

20:03.080 --> 20:06.280
Okay, and what about…

20:07.800 --> 20:09.400
-Tarka Dhal.
-Sorry, what was that?

20:10.000 --> 20:13.000
-Tarka Dhal.
-Yep, that's what I thought you said.

20:17.560 --> 20:20.040
Hey, I thought it was you.
How are you getting on?

20:20.120 --> 20:22.680
Yeah, all right. It's been a long day
though. I'm going home soon.

20:22.760 --> 20:24.680
Oh, yeah? Back to Albert Square?

20:37.920 --> 20:39.080
I'll be off then.

20:39.760 --> 20:41.840
You were right. This did come in handy.

20:41.920 --> 20:44.680
Plus, I dropped the c-bomb
and they settled down.

20:44.760 --> 20:48.160
Oh, my old trick.
I'm glad you stopped by, Cheryl.

20:48.240 --> 20:49.880
These are for you.

20:49.960 --> 20:53.040
-Oh. What are they?
-Handbound on cream parchment,

20:53.120 --> 20:55.680
personalized…
librettos.

20:55.760 --> 20:56.920
What's a libretto?

20:58.040 --> 20:59.840
Oh. Uh, the words to the songs.

20:59.920 --> 21:01.360
They were very expensive.

21:02.000 --> 21:03.040
Uh, right.

21:03.840 --> 21:06.080
-They look a bit of a faff.
-Ouch.

21:06.160 --> 21:08.680
Plus, uh, I got these off the Internet
for free,

21:08.760 --> 21:11.080
-so I'll use them if that's all right.
-Hmm.

21:11.160 --> 21:13.560
Hope you kept the receipt
for those, uh, lib things.

21:14.440 --> 21:15.840
Librettos.

21:22.960 --> 21:24.400
First day over.

21:25.200 --> 21:28.280
Well, I got through it. I'm still here.

21:28.360 --> 21:32.040
I've just got to keep going
and pray for justice.

21:33.400 --> 21:34.640
Tomorrow is a new day…

21:36.640 --> 21:39.600
…full of promise,
so there's no need to lose hope.

21:40.920 --> 21:44.080
I've just got to keep strong
and have faith.

21:45.240 --> 21:47.680
And know that everything
is gonna be all right in the end.

21:48.840 --> 21:51.600
Because it's like I always say,

21:52.560 --> 21:56.160
"Never underestimate
how good people can be."

21:58.040 --> 21:59.400
That's going nowhere.

22:01.800 --> 22:04.080
-I can't see where I'm going.
-Where did the water go?

22:04.160 --> 22:06.680
You fucking kidding me with this?
Who put the water off?

22:06.760 --> 22:08.240
What's going on, boos?

22:08.320 --> 22:10.200
Oh, no! No!

22:10.280 --> 22:13.440
No, Jeanie! Jeanie, cover that up!

22:14.720 --> 22:16.480
-Oh, no, has it gone?

22:16.560 --> 22:20.400
Oh, there's more of 'em!
No, I'm not paid enough for this!

22:20.480 --> 22:22.600
There'd better not be
any fucking cameras here.

22:23.400 --> 22:24.840
-Water main's burst.

22:25.600 --> 22:27.120
-What?
-No water at all

22:27.200 --> 22:30.760
in the entire prison, until it's fixed,
which could take 48 hours.

22:30.840 --> 22:32.200
What?

22:32.280 --> 22:34.240
Well, I did warn you it was gonna happen.

22:34.320 --> 22:36.120
-When?
-When we had the conversation

22:36.200 --> 22:37.920
where I told you
the plumbing needed fixing.

22:38.000 --> 22:41.280
They're already kicking off.
Let's hope it doesn't escalate.

22:42.080 --> 22:45.240
Do you remember the good old days?
When we used to have controlled riots.

22:45.320 --> 22:50.200
Yes, because I believe in
a safe environment, they have their place.

22:50.280 --> 22:52.120
And, riot!

22:54.520 --> 22:57.760
Please be aware of the person
closest to you.

22:59.080 --> 23:00.880
Let's bring that down by about 50%.

23:03.200 --> 23:07.400
I wanted them to have all the fun
of a riot without the danger.

23:07.480 --> 23:08.720
And how did that work out?

23:08.800 --> 23:11.000
It was not at all fun,
and it was quite dangerous.

23:16.320 --> 23:17.520
I remember now.

23:17.600 --> 23:21.440
Not at all fun, and quite dangerous.
Wasn't that your nickname in high school?

23:21.520 --> 23:22.880
No, my nickname was Margarine.

23:22.960 --> 23:26.200
-Why? Because your hair was always greasy?
-No, because I spread easily.

23:26.920 --> 23:29.280
Oh. The librettos have arrived, I see.

23:30.000 --> 23:32.720
-That's money well spent.
-It's… libretto!

23:33.480 --> 23:38.280
How many fucking times?

23:38.360 --> 23:40.600
And riot!

23:40.680 --> 23:42.760
She's cut off our water!

23:42.840 --> 23:46.880
Look at me. I was in there having a shower
and the water just stopped.
