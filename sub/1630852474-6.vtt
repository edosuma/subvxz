WEBVTT

00:02.000 --> 00:03.880
That is all you care about - a bet?

00:03.880 --> 00:06.040
That is the only reason
you are here?

00:06.040 --> 00:08.680
If you recall, I once planned
such an excursion myself.

00:08.680 --> 00:11.720
Made it as far as Victoria Station.
Dover, actually.

00:11.720 --> 00:14.000
I'm travelling the world,
like we planned!

00:14.000 --> 00:17.400
I just want you to be
proud of me, Estella, just once.

00:17.400 --> 00:20.080
We're here
because a woman broke his heart.

00:20.080 --> 00:23.520
A kind, perhaps brilliant, man
who many years ago...

00:23.520 --> 00:27.240
..was disappointed by the love of a
young woman, the mysterious Estella.

00:27.240 --> 00:29.920
Fogg is going to blow his brains
out with embarrassment

00:29.920 --> 00:31.080
when he reads this.

00:31.080 --> 00:33.600
But every word is true!
Every word was private!

00:33.600 --> 00:36.240
This is a warrant for your arrest.
I AM NOT A THIEF!

00:36.240 --> 00:38.160
He didn't steal it. I did.

00:38.160 --> 00:40.520
HE GROANS

00:38.160 --> 00:40.520
No!

00:40.520 --> 00:41.960
I'm coming into money.

00:41.960 --> 00:44.880
Christmas Eve, you say? Yes, if not
before, almost definitely before.

00:45.960 --> 00:48.720
Have you ever heard the expression,
"if you want something doing,

00:48.720 --> 00:50.760
"do it yourself"?

00:48.720 --> 00:50.760
GUN CLICKS

00:56.560 --> 00:58.560
SHIP'S HORN BLOWS

01:02.320 --> 01:04.560
Put the bill onto Mr Fogg's account.

01:11.360 --> 01:14.920
HELP!

01:14.920 --> 01:20.360
HELP! HELP!

01:20.360 --> 01:23.680
Who was that man with the gun?
Somebody help us!

01:23.680 --> 01:25.200
I don't think they can hear you!

01:25.200 --> 01:28.040
Yes, thank you, Passepartout,
that's why I'm shouting!

01:28.040 --> 01:30.680
I don't understand,
why would he do this to us?

01:30.680 --> 01:34.200
Clearly he's deranged -
there can be no other explanation.

01:34.200 --> 01:36.080
He seemed to know who we all were!

01:36.080 --> 01:38.040
Yes, yes, that's true.

01:38.040 --> 01:40.720
Now is not the time
for whos and whys.

01:40.720 --> 01:42.720
Have you something more pressing
to do?

01:42.720 --> 01:44.920
I'm just saying
we need to focus on finding land,

01:44.920 --> 01:47.080
and make the best of the situation.

01:47.080 --> 01:49.680
There is no best of it,
we are lost at sea,

01:49.680 --> 01:52.120
with one flask of water between us!

01:52.120 --> 01:55.720
It could be worse.How on earth
could this be any worse?

01:58.080 --> 02:00.480
THUNDER CRACKS

02:53.920 --> 02:57.600
WAVES CRASH

02:57.600 --> 03:00.320
BIRDS CHIRP

03:20.160 --> 03:22.000
HE SPLUTTERS

03:44.600 --> 03:46.480
Abigail?

03:48.560 --> 03:50.720
Passepartout?

03:55.880 --> 03:57.520
Abigail!

03:57.520 --> 03:58.720
Fogg?

03:58.720 --> 04:00.600
Abigail!

04:02.240 --> 04:06.000
Mr Fogg!
Thank heavens you're alive!

04:06.000 --> 04:08.720
Have you seen Passepartout?

04:08.720 --> 04:10.120
Not yet.

04:10.120 --> 04:12.600
If we have survived,
he must have, too.

04:20.600 --> 04:23.080
Passepartout?

04:23.080 --> 04:25.560
Passepartout?

04:25.560 --> 04:28.360
Passepartout?

04:28.360 --> 04:31.200
Passepartout?

04:34.440 --> 04:35.680
Mr Fogg!

04:41.440 --> 04:42.800
It's only his jacket.

04:42.800 --> 04:46.000
Last time we saw him, he was being
swallowed up by the sea.

04:46.000 --> 04:47.720
We are here, and he's not.

04:47.720 --> 04:50.760
It doesn't necessarily mean
he's dead.

04:50.760 --> 04:53.040
Do you really think he's dead?!

04:53.040 --> 04:55.120
No, I said NOT necessarily dead.

04:55.120 --> 04:58.680
Perhaps not even dead at all.
Alive, very much alive...somewhere.

05:02.800 --> 05:04.480
I don't know why I'm crying.

05:04.480 --> 05:07.320
When he was alive, I found
Passepartout quite irritating.

05:07.320 --> 05:09.120
At times, extremely irritating.

05:10.560 --> 05:12.720
He was so kind, too.Absolutely.

05:12.720 --> 05:15.080
PASSEPARTOUT: Aidez-moi!

05:15.080 --> 05:17.920
It's almost as if I can still hear
his voice.

05:17.920 --> 05:20.120
Argh! Argh! Aidez-moi! Argh!

05:20.120 --> 05:22.240
Aidez-moi! Aidez-moi!

05:25.240 --> 05:27.640
HE SPLUTTERS

05:30.400 --> 05:32.480
Argh!

05:33.520 --> 05:36.000
HE GRUNTS

05:36.000 --> 05:38.040
HE GROANS

05:38.040 --> 05:40.440
So you're not dead, Passepartout!

05:40.440 --> 05:42.440
Don't sound so disappointed.

05:43.520 --> 05:46.480
Fix was just worried about you,
that's all.

05:46.480 --> 05:48.120
Where are we?

05:49.400 --> 05:50.960
I think it's time we found out.

05:52.640 --> 05:54.840
I suggest we follow

05:54.840 --> 05:58.000
the beach until we find signs
of civilisation.

06:00.520 --> 06:02.280
With a little luck, there might be

06:02.280 --> 06:04.280
a British Consulate
we can call upon.

06:04.280 --> 06:05.800
HE GROANS

06:12.800 --> 06:16.480
Since we were nearly two days at sea
before being cast adrift,

06:16.480 --> 06:19.360
I would estimate we've probably
washed up somewhere on

06:19.360 --> 06:21.560
the coastline of Japan,

06:21.560 --> 06:24.440
or the Philippines or Formosa.

06:24.440 --> 06:26.520
That's most of Southeast Asia.

06:26.520 --> 06:28.200
Yes, I admit it's broad, but...

06:29.640 --> 06:32.280
..once we find a village,
they'll be able to tell us

06:32.280 --> 06:34.960
exactly where we are.
Although I did read an article in

06:34.960 --> 06:37.400
The Anthropological
Institute Journal

06:37.400 --> 06:40.480
that there may be some isolated
tribes in this region

06:40.480 --> 06:42.520
who have never encountered
an outsider.

06:42.520 --> 06:43.760
Is that a bad thing?

06:43.760 --> 06:46.160
Well, it was for Captain Cook.
But I'm sure the chances of that

06:46.160 --> 06:48.320
happening to us are very slim
indeed...

06:48.320 --> 06:50.400
You're very forward for a servant
or a waiter,

06:50.400 --> 06:53.440
or whatever you are tonight.
I'm just a man, mademoiselle.

06:56.680 --> 06:59.200
WHISPERS: I would care if you lived
or died...

06:59.200 --> 07:00.800
..a little bit.

07:04.160 --> 07:06.880
Thank you for fixing me, Miss Fix.

07:06.880 --> 07:07.920
TRAIN WHISTLE BLOWS

07:09.240 --> 07:11.680
..wouldn't you say, Abigail?

07:11.680 --> 07:13.120
Hm?

07:16.040 --> 07:17.760
Yes, indeed.

07:52.040 --> 07:54.960
The first thing I'm going to do
when we reach civilisation

07:54.960 --> 07:57.160
is take a long soak in a hot bath.

07:57.160 --> 07:58.440
For me, beer.

07:58.440 --> 08:01.440
Good idea - a cold beer
in a hot bath!

08:01.440 --> 08:03.720
Speaking of which,
do you have the flask?

08:06.640 --> 08:08.560
Is that all the water we have left?

08:08.560 --> 08:10.520
Sorry, I was rather thirsty.

08:14.760 --> 08:16.280
Is something wrong?

08:17.720 --> 08:20.200
It's the sun. When we set out,
it was on our left, then it was our

08:20.200 --> 08:22.960
right...and now it is on our left
again. Footprints! And they are

08:22.960 --> 08:24.200
fresh since the tide went out!

08:24.200 --> 08:26.600
You were right! Follow the beach
and we find civilisation!

08:26.600 --> 08:29.320
Let's see where these lead.
Aren't you coming?

08:29.320 --> 08:31.440
These footprints were made
by shoes -

08:31.440 --> 08:34.000
what do you think that says
about the people who live here?

08:34.000 --> 08:35.640
Nothing at all, I'm afraid...

08:37.040 --> 08:38.880
..because they're our footprints.

08:43.480 --> 08:47.080
We're on an island, and we've walked
all the way around it.

08:48.200 --> 08:50.400
Are you sure?
Perhaps you're mistaken?

08:50.400 --> 08:54.920
Look - that's the spot where we
dragged Passepartout from the sea.

08:56.120 --> 08:57.840
There's a piece of our lifeboat.

09:01.240 --> 09:05.040
Damn, damn, damn you to hell!

09:09.720 --> 09:11.400
Argh!

09:39.080 --> 09:44.040
Mr Bellamy? What is it?
This arrived for you, sir. Ah.

09:46.880 --> 09:48.680
Thank you, Wellington.

09:48.680 --> 09:50.120
BELL TINKLES

10:00.200 --> 10:01.640
Good news, Bellamy?

10:03.280 --> 10:05.960
A small business venture

10:05.960 --> 10:08.040
has turned remarkably favourable.

10:09.320 --> 10:12.400
I know this is a setback
but we've been in situations

10:12.400 --> 10:13.800
more hopeless than this.

10:13.800 --> 10:16.200
What could possibly be more hopeless
than this?

10:16.200 --> 10:17.920
The important thing now

10:17.920 --> 10:20.360
is we work together to survive here
until we are rescued.

10:20.360 --> 10:24.720
We will need food, fresh water
and shelter.

10:24.720 --> 10:26.080
I'll go get water.

10:26.080 --> 10:29.080
Excellent! I will forage for food.

10:29.080 --> 10:31.680
There must be something to eat
on the island.

10:33.400 --> 10:36.400
Perhaps you could make a start
on building a shelter.

10:36.400 --> 10:38.520
We'll help you when we return.

10:40.120 --> 10:41.640
Now we have a plan

10:41.640 --> 10:44.600
and everyone has a task.
It's all going to be fine!

11:40.480 --> 11:43.560
I found water! Fresh water.

11:50.880 --> 11:52.800
And it's cold!

11:52.800 --> 11:56.320
I never imagined
water could taste this good!

11:56.320 --> 11:58.600
HE LAUGHS

11:58.600 --> 12:00.000
What's that?

12:00.000 --> 12:02.800
Fruit I found for us to eat.

12:02.800 --> 12:04.040
Bravo!

12:04.040 --> 12:05.800
We make quite the team, we three!

12:05.800 --> 12:07.720
Water, fruit...

12:07.720 --> 12:10.240
..and shelter.

12:10.240 --> 12:13.120
Yes, well,
it's still a work-in-progress.

12:17.360 --> 12:18.880
Anyone hungry?

12:18.880 --> 12:21.600
Famished. I could eat a horse and
its rider.

12:21.600 --> 12:24.000
In that case, let's dine.

12:24.000 --> 12:25.640
Tropical treat.

12:25.640 --> 12:27.320
SHE GRUNTS

12:25.640 --> 12:27.320
How delicious.

12:35.760 --> 12:37.200
SHE GRUNTS

12:37.200 --> 12:39.560
Ugh!Oh, good God, that's ripe! Oof!

12:39.560 --> 12:41.360
It's repugnant!

12:41.360 --> 12:43.920
I imagine it tastes better
than it smells.

12:51.600 --> 12:53.480
What if it's poisonous?

12:54.480 --> 12:57.120
Some of the fruit had been eaten
by birds -

12:57.120 --> 12:59.960
they wouldn't do that
if it was poisonous.

12:59.960 --> 13:02.600
We must eat
to keep our strength up.

13:07.800 --> 13:11.520
THEY GAG

13:07.800 --> 13:11.520
That is truly vile.

13:12.600 --> 13:15.200
I can't eat this, I'm French.

13:15.200 --> 13:18.480
Well, if you want to survive,
you must.

13:19.600 --> 13:21.440
THUNDER RUMBLES

13:27.000 --> 13:28.720
Please, Mr Fogg, we're already

13:28.720 --> 13:30.840
weakened, we have to stay warm
and dry.

13:30.840 --> 13:32.680
Come, squeeze in tight,
out of the rain.

13:32.680 --> 13:34.240
I'm perfectly fine here.

13:34.240 --> 13:35.920
RAIN LASHES

13:38.440 --> 13:43.360
I'm afraid I owe you both
a sincere and abject apology.

13:43.360 --> 13:46.680
We can find more branches
for the roof tomorrow.

13:46.680 --> 13:49.000
No, it's not the roof,
or anything else.

13:51.400 --> 13:55.240
I am the reason we are marooned here
on this island.

13:55.240 --> 13:58.880
I was the one who embarked
on this calamitous journey...

14:00.800 --> 14:04.160
..and I brought you two with me
to this tropical prison.

14:04.160 --> 14:05.960
But that's not true.

14:05.960 --> 14:07.640
No, I'm afraid it is.

14:09.360 --> 14:13.240
Bellamy warned me that I didn't have
the stuff

14:13.240 --> 14:14.920
for a journey like this.

14:16.160 --> 14:17.960
But instead of heeding his advice,

14:17.960 --> 14:22.520
I allowed ego and pride
to cloud my judgment.

14:25.880 --> 14:28.200
And the wager,
that's done for now, too.

14:28.200 --> 14:31.280
Everything's done for.
It's all my fault.

14:34.680 --> 14:37.640
I'll never forget
the loyalty you two have shown me.

14:39.960 --> 14:42.400
I just hope you can forgive me
for letting you down.

14:42.400 --> 14:44.520
There is no need.

14:44.520 --> 14:47.560
The past is over now. Forgotten.

14:47.560 --> 14:49.240
I cannot forget it.

14:50.960 --> 14:52.880
And to know that you've forgiven me

14:52.880 --> 14:55.360
my shortcomings would be
a great relief.

14:55.360 --> 14:57.640
If it makes you happy,
I forgive you.

15:04.120 --> 15:05.920
You don't need my forgiveness.

15:05.920 --> 15:08.000
Nonetheless, I'd appreciate it.

15:10.480 --> 15:13.200
D'accord, I forgive you.

15:16.320 --> 15:18.840
Thank you, Passepartout,
it means a lot to me.

15:18.840 --> 15:20.520
THUNDER RUMBLES

15:21.840 --> 15:24.080
Things will seem better
in the morning.

15:47.280 --> 15:49.400
I cannot stomach
another piece of that fruit.

15:49.400 --> 15:50.920
You need to eat.

15:50.920 --> 15:53.360
I will find something else to eat,

15:53.360 --> 15:56.000
something that does not taste like
a punishment.

15:56.000 --> 15:57.360
SHE CHUCKLES

16:01.280 --> 16:03.360
I'm worried about Mr Fogg.

16:03.360 --> 16:05.840
He is still moping around
the back of the shelter,

16:05.840 --> 16:07.640
refusing to eat or do anything.

16:07.640 --> 16:09.480
He blames himself for all of this.

16:09.480 --> 16:11.280
We need to do something.

16:11.280 --> 16:13.920
We are both a little culpable
for bringing him

16:13.920 --> 16:16.920
to this low ebb.
I wrote that article about him,

16:16.920 --> 16:19.600
and you landed him in prison.

16:27.760 --> 16:29.800
What can we do, except give him
the time

16:29.800 --> 16:32.080
to accept
that this is not his fault?

16:32.080 --> 16:33.760
It's not always that simple.

16:37.520 --> 16:39.000
When I was a child,

16:39.000 --> 16:42.240
my mother suffered terribly
from melancholy.

16:44.360 --> 16:46.240
And when it took hold of her,

16:46.240 --> 16:48.640
it would not loosen its grip
for weeks.

16:50.120 --> 16:52.240
She'd lie in a darkened room,

16:52.240 --> 16:54.800
unable to see anyone or do anything.

16:54.800 --> 16:58.160
It was truly the most awful thing.

17:00.880 --> 17:03.920
We cannot allow that to happen
to Fogg.

17:03.920 --> 17:06.320
It will be a battle to survive here,

17:06.320 --> 17:08.360
and if he sinks into melancholy

17:08.360 --> 17:10.240
and loses all his fight,
he could die.

17:17.760 --> 17:21.360
I will go speak with him,
make him see sense.

17:21.360 --> 17:24.280
I'm not sure what you can say
that I haven't already tried.

17:26.200 --> 17:27.880
I will think of something.

17:41.720 --> 17:45.520
You may believe this is all
your fault, but I know it's not.

17:45.520 --> 17:48.640
Well, thank you, Passepartout,
that's very generous of you to say.

17:48.640 --> 17:51.800
The person who put us in
the lifeboat is the one to blame.

17:53.680 --> 17:55.680
His name is Kneedling,

17:55.680 --> 17:58.520
and he's been trying to sabotage
the journey for weeks.

17:58.520 --> 18:00.200
You know him?

18:00.200 --> 18:02.240
I've seen him. Spoken to him.

18:02.240 --> 18:04.920
When? In Aden, and Hong Kong, too.

18:06.720 --> 18:08.200
What exactly did he say?

18:10.840 --> 18:13.360
He offered me money
to delay your journey.

18:14.480 --> 18:18.240
Why didn't you mention this before?
I should have, it was a mistake.

18:18.240 --> 18:20.600
Yes, if you'd said,
I could have done something,

18:20.600 --> 18:23.600
alerted the authorities
to this Kneedling chap. I know.

18:25.440 --> 18:26.840
I'm sorry.

18:28.200 --> 18:30.000
I'm sorry.

18:32.080 --> 18:33.720
You didn't take the money from him?

18:37.440 --> 18:40.560
No, no, get away from me,
Passepartout. Go!

18:40.560 --> 18:42.640
What's going on?

18:42.640 --> 18:44.760
Tell her what you've done.

18:44.760 --> 18:46.480
Go on, tell her.

18:46.480 --> 18:48.160
If you don't tell her, I will!

18:48.160 --> 18:50.960
I already know what he did,
and he was only trying to help.

18:50.960 --> 18:52.640
How on earth was that helping?!

18:52.640 --> 18:54.760
He only stole it
to get money for the trip.

18:54.760 --> 18:57.280
He wasn't to know you'd get
the blame and end up in prison.

18:57.280 --> 18:58.920
What?

18:58.920 --> 19:00.840
If it wasn't that, what is it?

19:00.840 --> 19:03.560
I have done something terrible,
something I regret,

19:03.560 --> 19:05.080
and if I could go back in time,

19:05.080 --> 19:07.680
I would change my decision.
I can...

19:07.680 --> 19:10.880
The man who ordered us into the
lifeboat was called Kneedling, yes?

19:10.880 --> 19:15.280
Passepartout took a bribe from him
to sabotage our journey.

19:15.280 --> 19:17.680
Did I mention
this was a terrible mistake?

19:17.680 --> 19:20.120
Why would you do such a thing?
For money!

19:20.120 --> 19:23.280
He was paid to betray us -
like Judas!

19:23.280 --> 19:26.600
But I realised what I'd done was
wrong, and I gave the money back!

19:26.600 --> 19:30.440
Yes, unfortunately this epiphany
only came after he'd poisoned me

19:30.440 --> 19:33.320
with drugs given to him

19:33.320 --> 19:35.880
by this...this odious
Kneedling fellow!

19:35.880 --> 19:37.600
Your illness in Narupani?

19:37.600 --> 19:40.240
Oh, yes, yes, that near-death
experience was courtesy

19:40.240 --> 19:43.240
of my ever-loyal valet,
Monsieur Passepartout.

19:43.240 --> 19:46.120
To think I blamed myself
for us being stranded here,

19:46.120 --> 19:48.160
when it was entirely his fault!

19:48.160 --> 19:51.120
I even apologised to him last night,
and you accepted it!

19:51.120 --> 19:53.880
I did say there was no need.
Oh, how very considerate of you!

19:53.880 --> 19:56.560
Your betrayal is unforgivable,
I will not tolerate it.

19:58.520 --> 20:00.200
I will not share the company of

20:00.200 --> 20:03.000
a man who has behaved as you have.
I am ordering you to leave here now.

20:03.000 --> 20:04.880
Is that really necessary?

20:04.880 --> 20:06.760
Yes, I'm afraid so, yes.

20:07.760 --> 20:09.960
Now, please go.

20:12.080 --> 20:14.280
Passepartout, go!

20:19.280 --> 20:20.600
GO!

20:26.000 --> 20:28.440
I know what Passepartout did
was wrong.

20:28.440 --> 20:30.080
Worse than wrong. Unforgivable.

20:30.080 --> 20:31.640
Unforgivable!

20:33.240 --> 20:35.440
Well, I shan't waste another moment
on that man,

20:35.440 --> 20:36.680
I've more pressing matters.

20:36.680 --> 20:38.840
I am going to build a raft
to get us off this island.

20:38.840 --> 20:42.040
But we could be hundreds of miles
away from any sort of civilisation.

20:42.040 --> 20:45.040
Then, I shall build a raft strong
enough to withstand such a journey.

20:45.040 --> 20:47.080
Build it with what?

20:47.080 --> 20:48.520
Driftwood.

20:54.200 --> 20:56.800
And determination and ingenuity.

20:56.800 --> 20:59.840
It will not be easy, I know,
but I will do it, I promise you.

20:59.840 --> 21:02.600
And then you and I will sail away
from this wretched place,

21:02.600 --> 21:04.640
and leave Passepartout ALL ALONE!

21:39.400 --> 21:42.560
How can there be so little wood?
There must be wood somewhere.

21:43.760 --> 21:46.480
Do you think Passepartout has taken
all the wood for himself? No.

21:46.480 --> 21:47.680
Why would he do that?

21:47.680 --> 21:50.360
Well, who can even begin
to comprehend the motives of a man

21:50.360 --> 21:51.920
who would lie and steal

21:51.920 --> 21:54.040
and allow his friend
to take the blame?

21:54.040 --> 21:56.480
I know you don't want to accept it,
but Passepartout acted

21:56.480 --> 21:57.520
with good intentions.

21:57.520 --> 21:59.880
Well, his good intentions got me
the lash. He only stole

21:59.880 --> 22:02.560
the White Dragon to get money
for our trip, he did it to help us.

22:02.560 --> 22:05.360
I'd rather not have the help
of a man like Passepartout.

22:07.480 --> 22:09.160
He's coming this way.

22:09.160 --> 22:11.760
I don't care if he's giving birth
to the Messiah, ignore him!

22:11.760 --> 22:13.440
I think he wants to speak to us.

22:13.440 --> 22:17.280
That's far enough, that's far
enough! You come no further.

22:20.320 --> 22:22.000
This beach belongs to all of us.

22:22.000 --> 22:23.520
Very well.

22:30.680 --> 22:33.000
That side of the line is yours,
this side is mine,

22:33.000 --> 22:34.520
you're not welcome on my side.

22:34.520 --> 22:36.000
I am sorry.

22:36.000 --> 22:39.320
Well, as am I, taking you
into my employment, into my trust.

22:39.320 --> 22:41.320
No, save your breath,
save your breath.

22:41.320 --> 22:43.960
Abigail has told me exactly
what you did in Hong Kong.

22:43.960 --> 22:46.440
And despite your claims
of contrition,

22:46.440 --> 22:48.640
all I see is a liar and a thief.

22:48.640 --> 22:51.000
If I could go back
and undo what I did, I would.

22:51.000 --> 22:53.600
Well, you can't,
so that's of little use to us now.

22:53.600 --> 22:55.120
I didn't really know you then.

22:55.120 --> 22:58.320
And if I am honest, I thought
this trip of yours was ridiculous.

22:58.320 --> 23:00.080
Why on earth would you think that?

23:00.080 --> 23:03.320
You and Mr Bellamy betting more
money than most people have in

23:03.320 --> 23:05.640
a lifetime
on whether you can travel around

23:05.640 --> 23:06.840
the world in 80 days.

23:08.360 --> 23:10.880
I believed
it was a gentleman's folly.

23:12.080 --> 23:14.600
Yes, well, you were wrong,
you were very wrong.

23:14.600 --> 23:16.680
It's SO much more than that.

23:16.680 --> 23:18.440
I know that now.

23:18.440 --> 23:21.280
I can see how much this trip means
to you,

23:21.280 --> 23:24.120
and if it is important to you,
it is important to me.

23:24.120 --> 23:27.240
And yet your behaviour has
sabotaged everything.

23:28.440 --> 23:30.760
I know what I did was wrong,

23:30.760 --> 23:32.840
and I am determined
to make amends for that.

23:32.840 --> 23:35.800
I don't want your amends,
I want you to leave us alone.

23:35.800 --> 23:37.400
You don't mean that.

23:37.400 --> 23:41.440
Yes, I do. I want him to go,
off my beach, gone from my life.

23:41.440 --> 23:43.480
Well, I refuse to go.

23:43.480 --> 23:44.960
My friendship with you

23:44.960 --> 23:47.400
and Fix is too important
to be ruined by this disagreement.

23:47.400 --> 23:49.720
There is no friendship.
It is over, finished!

23:49.720 --> 23:51.120
Not for me.C'est fini!

23:51.120 --> 23:53.480
It is still alive,
and I intend to fight for it.

23:53.480 --> 23:56.120
Oh, yeah,
no, I've read about this.

23:56.120 --> 23:58.960
Yes, too much exposure to
the sun affects the brain.

23:58.960 --> 24:01.160
He's delirious. You're delirious!

24:26.600 --> 24:28.960
Passepartout's lit a fire.

24:31.400 --> 24:32.920
I think he's cooking something.

24:32.920 --> 24:34.600
He's goading us, ignore him.

24:37.480 --> 24:39.640
Your raft is progressing well.

24:39.640 --> 24:42.120
It may look that way,
but I'm afraid I'm stumped.

24:42.120 --> 24:45.360
Without a hammer or nails,
no way to fasten

24:45.360 --> 24:46.880
the wood together.

24:46.880 --> 24:49.880
Well, not securely enough
to withstand thrashing waves.

24:49.880 --> 24:51.600
I can help you with the raft.

24:51.600 --> 24:53.800
I don't need your help,
thank you very much.

24:57.040 --> 25:00.520
If you're hungry, I have lobsters.
Absolutely not.

25:00.520 --> 25:02.080
It does smell delicious!

25:02.080 --> 25:05.280
Have you forgotten what he did?
He is trying to make amends.

25:05.280 --> 25:08.320
And right now I'm so hungry,
Passepartout could have kidnapped me

25:08.320 --> 25:10.760
and brought me here with the sole
intention of selling me

25:10.760 --> 25:14.040
to slave traders, and I'd still
forgive him for a piece of lobster.

25:14.040 --> 25:15.680
We have our own food.

25:15.680 --> 25:19.200
I'm sorry, I cannot eat another
mouthful of that awful fruit.

25:47.240 --> 25:51.240
There is more chance
of me riding up The Mall

25:51.240 --> 25:54.280
in a wedding gown
than of Fogg winning our bet.

25:54.280 --> 25:55.720
How can you be so certain?

25:55.720 --> 25:58.160
He's already made his way
to the Americas.

25:58.160 --> 26:00.080
Call it gambler's intuition.

26:01.880 --> 26:05.480
Mr Fortescue, there's a gentleman
here wishes to see you.

26:05.480 --> 26:08.520
Well, what on earth does he want?
He's from the Foreign Office.

26:08.520 --> 26:10.880
Oh, well, um, send him over.

26:10.880 --> 26:12.520
HE SIGHS

26:14.520 --> 26:16.040
Mr Fortescue.

26:16.040 --> 26:17.720
Mr Fortescue, we have received

26:17.720 --> 26:21.600
correspondence from our Consulate
in Yokohama regarding

26:21.600 --> 26:24.240
a gentleman
we are led to understand is

26:24.240 --> 26:26.600
a friend of yours,
a Mr Phileas Fogg?

26:26.600 --> 26:28.880
Ah, yes, yes, that is correct.

26:28.880 --> 26:32.080
It seems the captain of
the SS Carnatic

26:32.080 --> 26:35.680
has reported Mr Fogg as
missing at sea,

26:35.680 --> 26:37.320
and feared dead.

26:37.320 --> 26:39.800
It is believed he fell overboard.

26:45.200 --> 26:46.800
Fogg is dead?

26:46.800 --> 26:49.000
In all likelihood, yes.

26:49.000 --> 26:52.720
My daughter, she was travelling
with Mr Fogg...

26:52.720 --> 26:55.240
There was no mention
of your daughter

26:55.240 --> 26:57.640
in the Consulate's correspondence.

26:57.640 --> 27:00.160
Although one of the other two people
missing from

27:00.160 --> 27:03.400
the ship's manifest is a woman,
but her name is not Fortescue.

27:04.720 --> 27:08.760
It is...Fix, Miss Abigail Fix.

27:08.760 --> 27:11.280
HE GASPS

27:21.640 --> 27:23.680
In the entire history of mankind,

27:23.680 --> 27:27.480
I doubt any food has ever tasted
quite as delicious as that.

27:32.720 --> 27:34.880
I meant what I said, you know.

27:34.880 --> 27:37.480
I know what I did was wrong,
and I am truly sorry.

27:37.480 --> 27:39.320
HE SCOFFS

27:41.000 --> 27:43.200
Since this all happened,
I keep asking

27:43.200 --> 27:46.120
why this man is
so intent on sabotaging the trip.

27:46.120 --> 27:47.760
I have wondered the same.

27:47.760 --> 27:49.440
And I remembered that

27:49.440 --> 27:51.840
Kneedling said he had a friend
who wanted us to fail.

27:51.840 --> 27:54.360
And there's only one person I know
who will profit if

27:54.360 --> 27:56.360
Fogg does not complete
the journey on time,

27:56.360 --> 27:58.920
and that is Mr Bellamy.
You will retract that remark!

28:00.200 --> 28:02.640
Who else has a reason
to wish failure on you?

28:02.640 --> 28:04.400
YOUR betrayal was bad enough,

28:04.400 --> 28:07.440
but to...to blame it
on one of my oldest friends,

28:07.440 --> 28:10.480
that's low, even for a Frenchman.

28:10.480 --> 28:12.920
Maybe because I'm French,
I don't understand how your

28:12.920 --> 28:15.200
English friendships work.
Every time I saw Bellamy at

28:15.200 --> 28:17.320
the Reform Club,
he was humiliating you!

28:17.320 --> 28:20.680
That's not true. Always making you
the joke of his butts.

28:20.680 --> 28:22.160
One more word about Bellamy,

28:22.160 --> 28:24.320
I will not be answerable
for my actions!

28:24.320 --> 28:27.360
You are very loyal to this man.
I only hope he's worthy of it.

28:27.360 --> 28:28.760
Yes, he is, yes!

28:28.760 --> 28:31.560
I imagine this great friendship is
built on more than you going to

28:31.560 --> 28:33.960
the same school,
or being members of the same club?

28:33.960 --> 28:39.320
It is built on many things,
many...many years of many things.

28:39.320 --> 28:41.520
You don't sound very certain.

28:41.520 --> 28:43.200
One thing I AM certain of,

28:43.200 --> 28:46.120
I have no desire to discuss this
or anything else with YOU!

29:09.560 --> 29:12.120
What Passepartout said
about Bellamy...

29:12.120 --> 29:14.040
..it does make sense.

29:14.040 --> 29:16.040
Bellamy would never conspire
against us.

29:16.040 --> 29:18.720
Never! He has been friends with me

29:18.720 --> 29:20.960
and your father since we were boys.

29:20.960 --> 29:23.680
It is too much to believe
he would do this to us.

29:23.680 --> 29:25.560
Then, who?

29:28.480 --> 29:30.800
I don't know, but not Bellamy.

29:30.800 --> 29:33.400
Bellamy is ten times the man
that Passepartout is.

29:33.400 --> 29:36.280
You are angry with Passepartout.
With excellent reason.

29:36.280 --> 29:39.120
Our treatment of him has not always
been without reproach, either.

29:39.120 --> 29:41.280
I employed him, I paid him,

29:41.280 --> 29:43.840
I trusted him,
what more could I have done?

29:43.840 --> 29:46.200
Passepartout saw his brother killed
in Paris,

29:46.200 --> 29:49.960
and he didn't even have the
opportunity to attend the funeral.

29:49.960 --> 29:53.320
He shot a man in the desert
to save us,

29:53.320 --> 29:55.360
and we barely acknowledged it.

29:56.600 --> 29:59.400
He has made many sacrifices
to help us,

29:59.400 --> 30:01.360
and we have taken that for granted.

30:04.320 --> 30:06.240
We have all made our mistakes.

30:09.400 --> 30:12.000
I should never have written
that article about you.

30:13.920 --> 30:16.520
I can see now that it was
a breach of our friendship.

30:18.000 --> 30:19.520
I'm sorry.

30:56.160 --> 30:59.440
RAIN LASHES, THUNDER RUMBLES

31:06.400 --> 31:08.640
HE GRUNTS

31:29.200 --> 31:30.720
HE GRUNTS

31:34.400 --> 31:36.400
THUNDER CRACKS

31:43.240 --> 31:45.120
HE GASPS

31:52.160 --> 31:53.200
THUNDER CRACKS

32:29.360 --> 32:31.640
You've finished the raft!

32:31.640 --> 32:34.000
Not me, it must have been
Passepartout.

32:35.880 --> 32:39.760
I don't know where he got these
vines, but they have done the job.

32:41.800 --> 32:43.600
It's practically finished!

32:43.600 --> 32:45.880
We can gather food
and water for the trip and launch.

32:45.880 --> 32:47.680
You mean go today, this morning?

32:47.680 --> 32:51.040
Well, I don't see why not,
it's not impossible.

32:53.680 --> 32:56.640
When I first met Passepartout,
I didn't trust him one bit.

32:56.640 --> 32:59.120
I thought he'd abandon us at
the very first opportunity,

32:59.120 --> 33:00.720
and if you'd told me then

33:00.720 --> 33:02.960
he would do something like this
for us,

33:02.960 --> 33:06.320
I wouldn't have believed you.
But he has changed.

33:06.320 --> 33:08.960
Thanks to Passepartout,
so has our situation.

33:10.200 --> 33:12.200
And without wishing to get ahead of
ourselves,

33:12.200 --> 33:13.960
if we were to reach landfall
quickly...

33:15.240 --> 33:17.760
..the wager with Bellamy
may not yet be lost.

33:20.720 --> 33:22.400
GENTLEMAN: Terrible news.

33:24.560 --> 33:25.880
There you are, sir.

33:25.880 --> 33:27.400
Read all about it.

33:36.800 --> 33:39.560
CLOCK CHIMES

33:39.560 --> 33:41.280
DOOR OPENS

33:58.920 --> 34:01.720
Read your editorial about Fogg
and Abigail.

34:01.720 --> 34:03.960
Damned fine piece,
you did them proud.

34:03.960 --> 34:06.160
That's very kind of you to say,
Bellars.

34:09.800 --> 34:15.760
Bellamy? The club wants to
commemorate Foggy at precisely 10am,

34:15.760 --> 34:19.480
the time he always arrived
at the club.

34:19.480 --> 34:23.520
We also thought it would be nice
if someone said a few words?

34:23.520 --> 34:25.320
Yes.

34:28.800 --> 34:31.320
What, you mean me? Well, er...

34:33.960 --> 34:37.760
..under the circumstances, we
thought that would be for the best.

34:40.960 --> 34:42.320
Erm...

34:42.320 --> 34:45.080
Well, you knew Foggy
as well as any of us.

34:46.680 --> 34:49.200
You know what a good egg he was.

35:04.160 --> 35:06.360
Have you seen Passepartout?

35:06.360 --> 35:08.880
No, not since last night.

35:19.680 --> 35:21.360
Passepartout?

35:23.920 --> 35:25.800
Passepartout?

35:32.000 --> 35:33.800
Passepartout?

35:37.760 --> 35:39.560
PASSEPARTOUT GROANS

35:39.560 --> 35:41.720
Here! Passepartout?

35:51.160 --> 35:54.000
No, I feel...

35:54.000 --> 35:55.760
HE RETCHES

36:07.360 --> 36:10.040
Passepartout's unwell!

36:12.840 --> 36:14.720
I don't feel a fever. I'm not hot.

36:16.720 --> 36:19.440
Let's get you in the shelter,
come on.

36:20.880 --> 36:23.360
I think he's been up there
all night!

36:23.360 --> 36:27.160
Good chap. I'll get fresh water -
he needs to keep drinking.Yes.

36:27.160 --> 36:29.280
Passepartout, I'm going to
rub your feet

36:29.280 --> 36:31.720
to get the blood moving,
keep your temperature up - yes?

36:31.720 --> 36:35.160
Good God, you're freezing,
absolutely freezing.

36:54.240 --> 36:56.320
Right, Abigail, I want you to keep
him warm,

36:56.320 --> 36:58.280
keep him drinking water.
Take that leg.

36:59.680 --> 37:02.080
Can't allow the circulation to drop.

37:02.080 --> 37:04.160
Drink some of this. Drink this.
Good man.

37:05.720 --> 37:06.960
Good man.

37:06.960 --> 37:09.200
Good, good.

37:06.960 --> 37:09.200
HE COUGHS

37:09.200 --> 37:12.160
Right, let me take the legs. Use
body temperature to keep him warm.

37:12.160 --> 37:15.680
Hold him. Don't be coy, Abigail!

37:40.200 --> 37:42.480
How can he still be this cold?

37:48.080 --> 37:50.160
That is the last of the shelter.

37:52.640 --> 37:54.640
That won't keep it going for long.

37:59.320 --> 38:01.200
We have to keep him warm,
you said that,

38:01.200 --> 38:03.520
and it's getting chilly,
we can't just do nothing.

38:06.520 --> 38:08.080
Did you hear me?

38:08.080 --> 38:10.600
We can't just do nothing.
No, we can't just do nothing.

38:18.080 --> 38:19.360
Give me a hand.

38:26.320 --> 38:29.200
The first time I laid eyes on
Phileas Fogg,

38:29.200 --> 38:31.720
he was a six-year-old boy
in short pants

38:31.720 --> 38:34.320
trying to push an extremely large
trunk

38:34.320 --> 38:36.640
up three flights of school stairs.

38:40.320 --> 38:42.040
And it wasn't even his trunk.

38:43.440 --> 38:47.360
# Tarry with me, O my Saviour

38:47.360 --> 38:52.880
# For the day is passing by

38:52.880 --> 38:57.960
# See the shades of evening gather

38:57.960 --> 39:03.200
# And the night is drawing nigh... #

39:04.120 --> 39:06.880
That's the kind of chap Foggy was,

39:06.880 --> 39:10.240
always willing to lend a chap
a hand.

39:13.000 --> 39:17.120
Always willing to...help a chap
in need.

39:17.120 --> 39:19.600
# Swift the night of death advances

39:19.600 --> 39:23.840
# Shall it be the night of rest?

39:23.840 --> 39:28.680
# Lonely seems the vale of shadow

39:28.680 --> 39:33.920
# Sinks my heart with troubled fear

39:33.920 --> 39:38.520
# Give me faith for clearer vision

39:38.520 --> 39:43.560
# Speak thou, Lord,
in words of cheer... #

39:43.560 --> 39:45.520
And he was an optimist, too,

39:45.520 --> 39:47.920
cos there wasn't a damned chance
in hell he was

39:47.920 --> 39:50.200
getting that trunk up three flights
on his own.

39:50.200 --> 39:52.920
He hadn't even made it
to the first floor when Fortescue

39:52.920 --> 39:55.400
and I had to lend our shoulders
to the task.

39:56.680 --> 39:58.200
And in that moment,

39:58.200 --> 40:03.000
a friendship that was forged
that lasted for 40 years.

40:04.200 --> 40:08.400
# Lonely seems the vale of shadow

40:08.400 --> 40:12.840
# Sinks my heart with troubled fear

40:12.840 --> 40:18.800
# Give me faith for clearer vision

40:18.800 --> 40:25.800
# Speak thou, Lord,
in words of cheer. #

40:25.800 --> 40:29.720
HE GRUNTS

40:29.720 --> 40:33.120
I don't need to tell anybody here
what kind of man Phileas Fogg was,

40:33.120 --> 40:35.000
because you all knew him.

40:36.680 --> 40:38.360
And anyone who knew Foggy

40:38.360 --> 40:42.160
knew he was the very best kind
of man.

41:06.320 --> 41:07.920
When did you wake?

41:09.280 --> 41:11.080
I've only been gone five minutes.

41:14.000 --> 41:17.440
Ah, well, you're warmer at least,
that's something. How do you feel?

41:18.480 --> 41:21.400
Better, I think.Keep drinking.

41:26.240 --> 41:28.160
You're back with us!

41:31.520 --> 41:33.320
What happened to the raft?

41:35.120 --> 41:37.480
Ah. Fogg burned it to keep you warm.

41:40.280 --> 41:42.800
But that was your way off
the island.

41:42.800 --> 41:44.200
We had to keep your temperature up.

41:46.520 --> 41:48.080
Thank you.

41:48.080 --> 41:49.840
It wasn't a difficult decision.

41:51.120 --> 41:53.880
Regardless, I will not forget.

41:57.280 --> 41:59.360
Lobster for breakfast,
how very grand!

41:59.360 --> 42:00.640
SHE LAUGHS

42:05.000 --> 42:07.200
You were right about Bellamy,
Passepartout.

42:10.080 --> 42:12.400
Who else has a motive
to sabotage our trip?

42:15.120 --> 42:16.840
He's not a bad sort, really.

42:16.840 --> 42:20.360
I don't believe that he'd wish us
marooned like this, or even hurt.

42:20.360 --> 42:22.120
I imagine...

42:22.120 --> 42:24.000
..that this man Kneedling

42:24.000 --> 42:26.600
was overzealous in carrying out
his task.

42:29.680 --> 42:32.080
And you were right, too, about him
undermining me,

42:32.080 --> 42:34.680
he has been doing that for
a very long time.

42:36.000 --> 42:37.960
When I was around your age...

42:39.960 --> 42:44.880
..I had planned on making a trip
a lot like this one.

42:44.880 --> 42:49.640
Not in 80 days, obviously, that
would have been ridiculous then,

42:49.640 --> 42:51.280
but at my leisure...

42:53.600 --> 42:55.720
..and with a woman I loved.

42:58.400 --> 43:01.640
Her name was Estella,
did I mentioned her?

43:01.640 --> 43:06.240
Yes, we planned to marry in Paris,
travel the world together.

43:08.640 --> 43:12.400
But Bellamy was against it,
of course.

43:12.400 --> 43:17.120
Never tired of telling me
that I wasn't worthy of Estella,

43:17.120 --> 43:20.280
and I wasn't up to a journey
like that.

43:20.280 --> 43:22.040
That's reprehensible.

43:22.040 --> 43:25.280
Well, no, I'm afraid in this
instance the blame lies with me.

43:25.280 --> 43:28.000
I should have had the courage
to ignore Bellamy

43:28.000 --> 43:30.040
and do as I wished, but instead...

43:35.280 --> 43:37.640
..I was barely on the train
to Dover when I wanted

43:37.640 --> 43:39.880
to turn around and go straight back
to London

43:39.880 --> 43:41.800
and the club and everything I knew.

43:43.440 --> 43:48.280
And then, by the time that we'd
boarded the ship, I was so filled

43:48.280 --> 43:50.040
with dread...

43:54.160 --> 43:56.000
..that I lied.

43:58.880 --> 44:01.760
Told Estella I'd left
a case at the station

44:01.760 --> 44:03.280
and I had to retrieve it.

44:04.600 --> 44:07.320
I think that I hoped that she'd
follow me off the ship, you know,

44:07.320 --> 44:10.920
we'd return to London together.
But she didn't.

44:13.080 --> 44:15.000
And instead she sailed away...

44:18.600 --> 44:20.880
..and travelled and lived her life,

44:20.880 --> 44:22.920
and I never saw her again.

44:27.560 --> 44:29.440
I did nothing with MY life.

44:29.440 --> 44:31.160
It has remained unlived.

44:31.160 --> 44:33.960
That's not true.
You're a famous adventurer.

44:36.080 --> 44:37.840
Abandoning Estella like that's

44:37.840 --> 44:40.000
the thing
that I'm most ashamed of...

44:41.680 --> 44:43.400
..and that I most regret.

44:49.080 --> 44:52.720
And I've never felt that
same close bond with anyone again.

44:58.160 --> 45:00.520
Not until this trip, with you two.

45:17.280 --> 45:21.360
What Fogg said earlier,
it was not what I was expecting.

45:21.360 --> 45:23.000
Nor I.

45:26.040 --> 45:30.120
It certainly explains why he got
so angry about the article I wrote.

45:31.400 --> 45:33.200
I got it all wrong.

45:33.200 --> 45:36.640
It's easy to misjudge people before
you get to know them properly.

45:41.000 --> 45:42.800
It is.

45:42.800 --> 45:44.600
When I first met Fogg,

45:44.600 --> 45:48.640
I thought he was a pompous
English fool. That was my mistake.

45:50.600 --> 45:53.760
And what did you think of me
when we first met?

45:53.760 --> 45:58.200
That you were bossy
and opinionated and impossible.

46:01.480 --> 46:05.360
And also clever
and independent-minded

46:05.360 --> 46:07.000
and very beautiful.

46:09.440 --> 46:11.240
I wasn't completely wrong -

46:11.240 --> 46:12.720
you ARE bossy and opinionated.

46:12.720 --> 46:15.600
Don't ruin it!

46:12.720 --> 46:15.600
HE LAUGHS

46:24.760 --> 46:27.680
FOGG: Ahoy! Ahoy!

46:31.080 --> 46:34.680
Look! Look! Look out there!
Have they seen us yet?

46:34.680 --> 46:38.080
This will help it smoke!

46:38.080 --> 46:39.240
HELLO!

46:39.240 --> 46:40.480
HEY!

46:40.480 --> 46:42.880
HERE! OVER HERE! HELLO!

46:42.880 --> 46:44.680
HEY! HERE! HELLO!

46:44.680 --> 46:46.400
HERE!

46:46.400 --> 46:48.800
OVER HERE!HERE!

46:50.400 --> 46:52.160
I think they've seen us!

46:54.840 --> 46:56.240
I think it's turning!

46:56.240 --> 46:57.680
THEY CHEER

46:57.680 --> 46:59.760
HERE! HERE!

47:03.400 --> 47:05.600
INDISTINCT CONVERSATION

47:14.520 --> 47:17.560
You don't look very pleased
to be rescued.

47:17.560 --> 47:18.960
I am.

47:18.960 --> 47:21.840
I just wish they could have arrived
half an hour later.

47:23.600 --> 47:24.960
Me too.

47:28.680 --> 47:30.760
Well, it seems they saw the smoke

47:30.760 --> 47:33.120
from our bonfire and decided
to investigate.

47:33.120 --> 47:34.800
That is fortuitous!

47:34.800 --> 47:39.200
Yes. First Mate Thearle, there,
believes that we'll be in America

47:39.200 --> 47:40.920
the day after the Carnatic.

47:40.920 --> 47:42.480
Pas mal!Yes!

47:42.480 --> 47:45.560
Ha! I can't say I will miss
this wretched island.

47:46.840 --> 47:49.280
But nor shall I ever forget

47:49.280 --> 47:52.080
the time that we three spent
together here.

47:55.000 --> 47:57.440
So, are we ready? Yes?

48:01.040 --> 48:03.320
All right, sir?Thank you. Come on.

48:04.680 --> 48:07.680
Right! Let's get you onboard, sir.
Very good!

48:07.680 --> 48:10.400
You should let Miss Fix
get on there first.

48:10.400 --> 48:12.400
Allow me, madam. Thank you!
There we are.

48:12.400 --> 48:15.680
Passepartout, after you.
No, you, monsieur.Please, go on.
