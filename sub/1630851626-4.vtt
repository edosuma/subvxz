00:01.610 --> 00:04.178
Hey. I have fresh-baked
cookies for everyone.

00:04.221 --> 00:05.483
Not for me.

00:05.527 --> 00:07.311
I'm slimming down
for bikini season.

00:07.355 --> 00:08.399
It's October.

00:08.443 --> 00:11.011
I like to get a running start.

00:12.925 --> 00:14.666
GINA:
Cookie?

00:17.452 --> 00:18.844
Down, boy.

00:18.888 --> 00:20.933
What? Sorry, is it my turn?

00:20.977 --> 00:22.457
You know, you're not
fooling anybody.

00:22.500 --> 00:23.980
Every time
she walks in the room,

00:24.024 --> 00:25.634
you get the same stupid look
on your face.

00:25.677 --> 00:26.591
I do not.

00:29.551 --> 00:30.900
Why don't you just ask her out?

00:30.943 --> 00:32.945
It's complicated.

00:32.989 --> 00:34.382
Our friendship is-is every bit

00:34.425 --> 00:36.210
important to me...
Wimp.

00:36.253 --> 00:38.255
You know, it's hateful
when my daughter calls me that.

00:38.299 --> 00:39.561
I won't take it from you.

00:40.562 --> 00:42.564
Is that so?

00:43.695 --> 00:45.001
Bluff called.

00:46.220 --> 00:47.743
Cookie?

00:47.786 --> 00:49.701
Oh, thank you, sweetheart.

00:49.745 --> 00:51.703
Oh, for God's sakes,
she's not your sweetheart.

00:51.747 --> 00:53.270
Her name is Gina.

00:53.314 --> 00:56.230
You don't mind if I call you
sweetheart, do you, honey?

00:56.273 --> 00:58.014
Well, it's not my favorite...

00:58.058 --> 00:59.668
You're patronizing her.

00:59.711 --> 01:01.278
She's just too nice
to stand up for herself.

01:01.322 --> 01:02.888
GINA:
Well, actually,

01:02.932 --> 01:05.630
I can take care of..."Sweetheart" is a compliment

01:05.674 --> 01:09.156
that men pay to women
when they like them.

01:09.199 --> 01:10.983
It might be new to you.

01:11.941 --> 01:13.377
Oh, so when I call you
"jackass,"

01:13.421 --> 01:14.987
that can be a compliment, too.

01:15.031 --> 01:17.207
You know what's wrong
with broads like you?

01:17.251 --> 01:19.253
No, but I know what's wrong
with misogynistic Neanderthals

01:19.296 --> 01:20.863
who believe
that a woman's self-worth

01:20.906 --> 01:23.126
is tied to what men
think of her.

01:29.263 --> 01:31.526
That's a great ass.

02:07.562 --> 02:08.737
Hey.

02:08.780 --> 02:09.825
Morning.

02:09.868 --> 02:11.131
Got you coffee.

02:11.174 --> 02:13.002
Thanks.

02:13.045 --> 02:16.179
It's a little creepy,
you watching me sleep.

02:16.223 --> 02:17.528
What are you talking about?

02:17.572 --> 02:19.617
I was reading the CNN
on the phone.

02:19.661 --> 02:21.793
Yeah, what's going on?

02:21.837 --> 02:25.667
Oh, everything's bad.
The whole world is...

02:25.710 --> 02:29.192
[exhales] You know, you could go
eat breakfast with the others.

02:29.236 --> 02:31.194
You don't have to be here
all the time.

02:31.238 --> 02:33.588
I know, but then
I'd have to talk to them.

02:33.631 --> 02:35.111
Oh, Harry, what happened to you?

02:35.155 --> 02:36.112
[knocking on door]

02:36.156 --> 02:38.070
I'm fine. It's...

02:38.114 --> 02:40.072
Other people, they're the worst.

02:42.597 --> 02:45.600
Good morning.
Welcome to Wednesday.

02:45.643 --> 02:47.254
Hump Day.

02:49.169 --> 02:50.779
Need I say more?

02:50.822 --> 02:52.694
Um, I got your new meds.

02:52.737 --> 02:53.956
You're supposed to take
one tablet

02:53.999 --> 02:55.914
three times a day with meals.

02:55.958 --> 02:57.307
Thank you.HARRY:
That's right,

02:57.351 --> 02:58.700
I'll put a reminder
on my phone here.

02:58.743 --> 03:00.223
I won't forget.Uh, the phone is better

03:00.267 --> 03:01.790
at remembering.

03:01.833 --> 03:03.183
[sighs]
Would you go to the dining room

03:03.226 --> 03:04.488
and get me a muffin?

03:04.532 --> 03:05.489
I'll get you some fruit.

03:05.533 --> 03:06.490
I don't want fruit.

03:06.534 --> 03:08.623
You're getting fruit.

03:08.666 --> 03:09.711
[door closes]

03:09.754 --> 03:11.191
You hear him?

03:11.234 --> 03:13.105
He's worried about
how much sugar I eat.

03:13.149 --> 03:15.195
You two are so cute.

03:15.238 --> 03:17.545
Yeah, we're Beyoncé
and what's-his-name.

03:17.588 --> 03:20.417
Listen, I need a favor.

03:20.461 --> 03:21.636
Oh, anything.

03:21.679 --> 03:23.377
Ever since I got sick,

03:23.420 --> 03:25.988
Harry's whole world has
been about taking care of me.

03:26.031 --> 03:27.119
Well, he loves you.

03:27.163 --> 03:28.164
And I love him.

03:28.208 --> 03:30.210
Please get him out of here.

03:30.253 --> 03:32.473
Okay, um...

03:32.516 --> 03:34.692
Ugh, any suggestions?

03:34.736 --> 03:38.566
I don't know, he likes going to
the minor league baseball games.

03:38.609 --> 03:40.698
Maybe you can find
somebody to take him?

03:40.742 --> 03:44.876
Maybe. Is there a dating app
for cranky old men?

03:44.920 --> 03:48.619
Whatever you got to do.
I need a break.

03:48.663 --> 03:50.752
I'm on it.Thanks.

03:50.795 --> 03:52.232
Oh, um...

03:53.276 --> 03:54.538
It's Jay-Z.

03:54.582 --> 03:56.627
What is?
Beyoncé's husband.

03:56.671 --> 03:59.239
That's right. I like him.

03:59.282 --> 04:02.285
He looks like he can
deliver the mail.

04:02.329 --> 04:06.463
Yes, I would expect he can.

04:08.030 --> 04:10.075
I'll take care of it.

04:10.119 --> 04:11.338
Hey, Althea,

04:11.381 --> 04:12.774
have you seen Gabby or Gideon?

04:12.817 --> 04:15.080
They're outside smoking pot.

04:15.124 --> 04:17.822
Man. It is 9:00 a.m.

04:17.866 --> 04:19.607
It's called "wake and bake."

04:19.650 --> 04:22.392
I know what it's called.Of course you do.

04:22.436 --> 04:25.961
Until a few weeks ago, you
reeked of Febreze and Doritos.

04:26.918 --> 04:29.007
Yeah, well, I am management now.

04:29.051 --> 04:32.141
And we're all rooting for you.

04:35.100 --> 04:37.799
[phone ringing]

04:37.842 --> 04:41.281
Hey, kidney buddy.

04:41.324 --> 04:43.848
Okay, you can't tell me not
to say it and then you say it.

04:43.892 --> 04:47.112
I saved your life.
I can say whatever I want.

04:47.156 --> 04:48.853
Fair enough.

04:48.897 --> 04:51.769
Hey, I was wondering if
I could take you out to dinner

04:51.813 --> 04:54.337
to celebrate you buying
Valley Hills?

04:54.381 --> 04:55.382
Yeah, I'd love that.

04:55.425 --> 04:57.253
[laughs]

04:57.297 --> 04:59.473
Saturday?

04:59.516 --> 05:01.126
Yeah, that'd be great.

05:01.170 --> 05:04.434
Oh, hey, while I have you,
can I ask you a favor?

05:04.478 --> 05:06.784
Your wish is my command, milady.

05:06.828 --> 05:10.353
Dost thou need help
moving a cumbersome sofa?

05:10.397 --> 05:14.575
I need you to take Harry
to a baseball game.

05:14.618 --> 05:16.664
A baseball game?

05:16.707 --> 05:18.883
That's gonna be outside, right?

05:18.927 --> 05:20.755
Please. You'll be
saving a marriage.

05:20.798 --> 05:22.191
I guess.

05:22.234 --> 05:24.280
It's just the mosquitos,
they love me.

05:24.324 --> 05:26.195
My mother used to say
it was because I was so sweet.

05:26.238 --> 05:27.370
[chuckles]

05:27.414 --> 05:29.372
So you'll do it?Sure.

05:29.416 --> 05:32.288
And we're on for our date?
I-I mean, it's not a date date.

05:32.332 --> 05:34.116
It's a friendly dinner date.

05:34.159 --> 05:35.900
I have a baseball date
with Harry.

05:35.944 --> 05:38.468
Which one's gonna be crazier?
Let's find out.

05:38.512 --> 05:39.904
Bye, Drew.

05:39.948 --> 05:41.645
Thank you for ending
this conversation.

05:43.604 --> 05:45.910
Really?

05:45.954 --> 05:47.216
Just exhale.

05:49.566 --> 05:51.438
You I expect this from, but you?

05:51.481 --> 05:52.656
I'm sorry.

05:52.700 --> 05:54.441
I'm going through some stuff.

05:54.484 --> 05:55.833
We're all going through
some stuff, but that doesn't...

05:55.877 --> 05:57.705
Xander left me
for his spin instructor,

05:57.748 --> 05:59.881
and I just needed something
to take the edge off.

05:59.924 --> 06:03.363
And this shizzle is working.

06:04.451 --> 06:06.844
W-Why would you expect it
from me?

06:06.888 --> 06:09.325
I used to get high
with you every day.

06:09.369 --> 06:11.022
That's fair.

06:11.066 --> 06:14.243
Gideon, I am sorry about Xander.
He was a beautiful man,

06:14.286 --> 06:17.115
but we all know
that pastry chefs can be fickle.

06:17.159 --> 06:18.943
Moving forward,

06:18.987 --> 06:22.382
I need you both to leave your
personal problems at home, okay?

06:22.425 --> 06:24.079
It will not happen again.

06:25.080 --> 06:27.387
Yeah, sure.

06:27.430 --> 06:29.389
[device beeping]

06:29.432 --> 06:31.521
[gasps]
Oh, no. It's Norma's alert.

06:31.565 --> 06:33.958
Do you know Xander didn't even
want to take that spin class?

06:34.002 --> 06:35.699
I made him.

06:38.180 --> 06:39.834
Oh, my God, are you okay?

06:39.877 --> 06:41.401
Do I look okay?

06:41.444 --> 06:42.489
GIDEON:
Don't move.

06:42.532 --> 06:43.925
I'll call the EMTs.

06:43.968 --> 06:46.449
No, no, I don't need them.
Just help me up.

06:46.493 --> 06:48.233
Okay, nice and slow.[grunts]

06:48.277 --> 06:49.496
Did you hit your head?

06:49.539 --> 06:52.194
No, just mostly landed
on my ass.

06:52.237 --> 06:53.325
Nature's airbag.

06:53.369 --> 06:56.241
You're free to leave.

06:56.285 --> 06:57.765
Norma, I know you don't
want to hear this,

06:57.808 --> 06:59.462
but if you are not
gonna get the hip surgery,

06:59.506 --> 07:01.333
then you have to use the walker.

07:01.377 --> 07:04.336
Those things are for old people.

07:04.380 --> 07:06.469
Who wants to tell her?

07:06.513 --> 07:08.428
Have you had breakfast?

07:08.471 --> 07:09.951
Not yet.All right,

07:09.994 --> 07:10.995
you guys go
get her something to eat.

07:11.039 --> 07:12.475
I'll stay here.

07:12.519 --> 07:15.913
Girl, we got to stop
getting high on the job.

07:15.957 --> 07:18.002
Why?

07:19.003 --> 07:21.266
Norma, I'm on your side.

07:21.310 --> 07:23.138
I just want you to be safe.

07:23.181 --> 07:25.967
I know you do, sweetheart.
Thank you.

07:26.010 --> 07:28.186
So you'll use your walker?

07:28.230 --> 07:30.406
No.

07:30.450 --> 07:33.844
Why does it smell
like a reggae concert in here?

07:34.845 --> 07:36.412
New wig?

07:36.456 --> 07:38.327
Thank you for noticing.

07:38.370 --> 07:40.982
Matches the carpet,
if you know what I mean.

07:42.984 --> 07:44.638
How's the chicken?

07:44.681 --> 07:46.727
Under-seasoned, overcooked.

07:46.770 --> 07:48.990
I was gonna get that,
but I got salmon instead.

07:49.033 --> 07:51.993
And?I'm filled with regret.

07:52.036 --> 07:53.516
Would you like some chicken?

07:53.560 --> 07:54.561
You just said it was no good.

07:54.604 --> 07:56.780
It isn't. Would you like some?

07:57.781 --> 07:59.261
I'll take a bite.

07:59.304 --> 08:00.654
[door closes]

08:00.697 --> 08:02.438
Hey, Bette, glad I got you.

08:02.482 --> 08:03.874
Hold on.

08:03.918 --> 08:05.136
[spits]

08:06.921 --> 08:08.400
Go ahead.

08:08.444 --> 08:11.403
Yeah, I just wanted to apologize
for yesterday.

08:12.404 --> 08:13.449
Oh.

08:13.493 --> 08:14.668
Well, thank you, Spencer.

08:14.711 --> 08:17.758
Yeah. I'm sorry
you got so upset.

08:17.801 --> 08:20.195
Wait, you're sorry I got upset,

08:20.238 --> 08:21.979
you're not sorry
you were a jerk?

08:22.023 --> 08:23.546
Here we go.

08:23.590 --> 08:26.331
Now I got to apologize
for the way I apologized?

08:26.375 --> 08:28.203
You didn't actually apologize.

08:28.246 --> 08:30.379
Did he just apologize?He did not.

08:30.422 --> 08:32.207
Who asked you?She did.

08:32.250 --> 08:34.688
And she couldn't
have been more clear.

08:34.731 --> 08:36.994
I said I was sorry.

08:37.038 --> 08:39.257
For me being upset.
You're making it all my fault.

08:39.301 --> 08:40.868
This is a load of crap.

08:40.911 --> 08:43.131
I said I'm sorry.
What more do you want me to say?

08:43.174 --> 08:45.612
Actually, I'd prefer it
if you took a vow of silence.

08:50.834 --> 08:53.489
It's really a top-notch ass.

08:55.970 --> 08:57.711
"The Hartford Yard Goats."

08:57.754 --> 08:59.669
Yeah.Not a very imposing name.

08:59.713 --> 09:01.671
"Watch out for us,
we'll eat your trash."

09:01.715 --> 09:02.890
[chuckles]

09:02.933 --> 09:04.195
You done?

09:04.239 --> 09:06.241
I also noticed that,
for a Double-A team,

09:06.284 --> 09:09.026
they're not using
any batteries. [chuckles]

09:09.070 --> 09:10.593
I am done.

09:10.637 --> 09:12.160
UMPIRE:
Ball one!

09:12.203 --> 09:15.293
This may be the one
and a half light beers talking,

09:15.337 --> 09:17.165
but I am enjoying myself.

09:17.208 --> 09:18.601
Hey.
The sun,

09:18.645 --> 09:20.342
the smell of the grass,
the guy shouting,

09:20.385 --> 09:22.170
[old-timey accent]: "Popcorn,
get your popcorn here."

09:22.213 --> 09:23.606
MAN:
Two popcorn.

09:23.650 --> 09:24.825
[regular accent]:
Oh, no, sorry,

09:24.868 --> 09:26.043
I'm just doing
a funny impression.

09:26.087 --> 09:27.523
Don't have popcorn.

09:27.567 --> 09:29.830
Oof. Embarrassing.

09:29.873 --> 09:33.268
Although, a testament
to my improvisational skills.

09:33.311 --> 09:34.878
Just watch the game.

09:34.922 --> 09:36.880
Yes, sir.UMPIRE: Strike two!

09:38.534 --> 09:40.623
The fellow at third base,

09:40.667 --> 09:43.495
speaking sign language,
who is he talking to?

09:43.539 --> 09:45.323
The batter.

09:45.367 --> 09:46.803
Is he deaf?

09:47.848 --> 09:50.241
Yeah.

09:50.285 --> 09:52.069
Wow. [chuckles]UMPIRE: Ball three.

09:52.113 --> 09:54.289
What a human interest story.
That should be a movie.

09:54.332 --> 09:56.900
Or better yet, a podcast.

09:58.554 --> 10:02.253
Was your dad a traveling
salesman, away from home a lot?

10:02.297 --> 10:04.647
No. Why?

10:04.691 --> 10:07.258
You seem like a kid who spent
a lot of time with his mother.

10:07.302 --> 10:09.304
She wasmy best friend.

10:09.347 --> 10:11.785
UMPIRE:
We got a full count.

10:13.351 --> 10:17.051
So when are you gonna work up
the balls to ask Gina out?

10:17.094 --> 10:19.314
I'm happy to answer your
question, but know that I hear

10:19.357 --> 10:22.317
the condescension
in your choice of words.

10:22.360 --> 10:24.101
Congratulations.

10:24.145 --> 10:25.581
So, when?

10:25.625 --> 10:27.365
As a matter of fact,

10:27.409 --> 10:29.367
I'm taking her
to dinner this weekend.UMPIRE: Time out.

10:29.411 --> 10:31.631
Really?
Yes.

10:31.674 --> 10:33.807
You don't give me enough credit,
but I do have game.

10:33.850 --> 10:36.244
Well, that's-that's
good to hear.

10:36.287 --> 10:38.725
And not that
it's any of your business,

10:38.768 --> 10:41.858
but it is my intention to let
her know how I feel about her,

10:41.902 --> 10:43.991
to put my baseballcards
on the table.

10:44.034 --> 10:45.688
There you go.[bat cracks]

10:46.733 --> 10:49.474
[cheering, applause]

10:49.518 --> 10:51.781
Whoa. That was close.

10:51.825 --> 10:55.089
You have no idea. Here.

10:55.132 --> 10:56.220
Go ahead.
Really?

10:56.264 --> 10:58.135
Yeah.
Huh.

10:59.136 --> 11:01.399
Do you fellas need this back?

11:08.406 --> 11:10.060
Yeah, that's right, Mindy.
I'm on a walker.

11:10.104 --> 11:11.366
Keep moving.

11:14.412 --> 11:16.153
MEREDITH:
It's open.

11:17.589 --> 11:19.417
Hey.

11:19.461 --> 11:21.115
What's up?

11:21.158 --> 11:23.030
Well, I'm going to the dining
room for coffee and cake.

11:23.073 --> 11:25.119
I should be there
in about three hours.

11:25.162 --> 11:26.947
Would you like to join me?

11:26.990 --> 11:29.558
Sure. Hang on.

11:40.656 --> 11:42.658
Take your time. No rush.

11:44.616 --> 11:46.531
Man, this could have killed me.

11:47.489 --> 11:50.013
Maybe it did and we're in hell.

11:50.057 --> 11:51.536
Who you calling?

11:51.580 --> 11:54.496
Meredith. Just reminding
her to take her pills.

11:54.539 --> 11:56.106
It's voice mail.

11:56.150 --> 11:57.934
Meredith, i-it's me.

11:57.978 --> 12:00.589
Please, take your pills.
Don't forget, okay?

12:00.632 --> 12:03.548
Um, and, uh, call me
back when you get this.

12:03.592 --> 12:05.202
VENDOR:
Peanuts! Get your peanuts here!

12:05.246 --> 12:07.248
Mm, peanuts.

12:07.291 --> 12:10.033
Did you know that just one could
cause me uncontrolled vomiting,

12:10.077 --> 12:11.687
diarrhea and death?
[chuckles]

12:11.731 --> 12:14.168
Yeah, well, you're
a delicate flower.

12:14.211 --> 12:16.474
That is exactly what
my mother used to call me.

12:17.649 --> 12:20.478
She's not answering
my texts, either.UMPIRE: Ball two.

12:20.522 --> 12:21.741
Let's go.

12:21.784 --> 12:23.133
What? Why?

12:23.177 --> 12:25.222
Something's wrong.
We-we got to leave.

12:25.266 --> 12:26.571
Okay.

12:29.052 --> 12:31.663
Sorry. Pardon me.

12:31.707 --> 12:33.317
Look, I got a ball.
[chuckles]

12:35.711 --> 12:36.930
I'm sure she's fine.

12:36.973 --> 12:39.149
No, she always
answers the phone.

12:39.193 --> 12:40.455
[door beeps]

12:42.022 --> 12:43.806
Where the hell is she?

12:43.850 --> 12:46.504
Meredith?

12:46.548 --> 12:47.897
[mutters]:
Come on.

12:47.941 --> 12:50.204
Mer...
[sighs]

12:50.247 --> 12:51.945
Son of a bitch.

12:51.988 --> 12:55.557
Oh, this is so good.

12:55.600 --> 12:57.864
[laughs] That's because
they don't make it here.

12:59.909 --> 13:02.346
Harry gives me such a hard time
about my diet.

13:02.390 --> 13:06.873
And I'm like, "Hey, who cares?
I've got cancer."

13:06.916 --> 13:08.483
What's the prognosis?

13:08.526 --> 13:09.658
Stage IV.

13:09.701 --> 13:11.660
How many stages are there?

13:11.703 --> 13:12.792
Four.

13:12.835 --> 13:14.358
I'm sorry.

13:15.359 --> 13:17.100
Well...

13:17.144 --> 13:19.624
You're not doing
too well, either, huh?

13:19.668 --> 13:21.235
Oh, this is nothing.
They can fix it.

13:21.278 --> 13:23.324
So why don't you?

13:23.367 --> 13:25.413
I'm too busy
feeling sorry for myself.

13:25.456 --> 13:27.067
Been there.

13:28.285 --> 13:29.983
Thank God.

13:30.026 --> 13:32.246
Why the hell didn't you
pick up your phone?

13:32.289 --> 13:35.466
Fine. How are you?

13:35.510 --> 13:37.077
I was calling, I was texting,
you didn't answer.

13:37.120 --> 13:39.253
I left my phone in the room.

13:39.296 --> 13:41.211
But you can't do that.
I have to know where you are.

13:41.255 --> 13:44.606
Relax. I took my meds,
everything's fine.

13:44.649 --> 13:45.825
Come on, let's get you
back to bed. Come on.

13:45.868 --> 13:47.914
I'm having cake with my friend.

13:47.957 --> 13:50.220
Hello.HARRY:
Hello, hello.

13:50.264 --> 13:52.483
Um, so, you're feeling okay?

13:52.527 --> 13:55.660
Yes, I'm having a good day.
You can stop hovering.

13:55.704 --> 13:57.749
I'm not hovering. I'm concerned.

13:57.793 --> 14:01.405
You're like a helicopter.
A very old helicopter.

14:01.449 --> 14:03.973
Well, excuse me
for giving a damn.

14:08.586 --> 14:10.893
You, have something
you want to say?

14:10.937 --> 14:13.548
Oh, I...

14:13.591 --> 14:15.637
I caught a baseball.

14:16.986 --> 14:19.902
All right, everybody, buckle up.

14:19.946 --> 14:22.035
I'm not real good at this.

14:23.036 --> 14:26.735
Hot date?
Who's the unlucky woman?

14:26.778 --> 14:28.650
They're for my wife's grave.

14:28.693 --> 14:30.913
Oh, I'm sorry.

14:30.957 --> 14:33.307
How did I not know
you'd been married?

14:33.350 --> 14:35.222
Maybe because your life's
the only one

14:35.265 --> 14:36.919
you pay attention to.

14:36.963 --> 14:38.573
Maybe.

14:38.616 --> 14:41.054
When did she pass?

14:41.097 --> 14:43.230
She's been gone five years now.

14:43.273 --> 14:46.233
So, uh, birthday,
your anniversary?

14:46.276 --> 14:50.628
Neither. Jackie and I--
Jackie was my wife--

14:50.672 --> 14:52.326
we always liked

14:52.369 --> 14:54.719
to watch the sunset together.

14:54.763 --> 14:57.287
Every so often I still try.

14:57.331 --> 14:58.941
That's very sweet.

14:58.985 --> 15:00.856
She was a helluva broad.

15:00.900 --> 15:03.554
Took care of me
a long time when I was hurt.

15:03.598 --> 15:04.816
What happened?

15:04.860 --> 15:06.949
I was a transit cop in New York.

15:06.993 --> 15:08.951
Broke my back on the job.

15:08.995 --> 15:11.040
Oh, my God, that's awful.

15:11.084 --> 15:13.695
Wasn't great. A lot of rehab.

15:13.738 --> 15:16.132
Had to learn to walk again.

15:16.176 --> 15:19.048
But could've been worse.

15:19.092 --> 15:22.182
A bunch of my friends didn't
make it home at all that day.

15:22.225 --> 15:25.141
"That day"? You mean...?

15:25.185 --> 15:27.839
South Tower.

15:27.883 --> 15:29.450
Jackie put up

15:29.493 --> 15:31.669
with me through it all.

15:31.713 --> 15:36.631
Believe it or not,
I canbe high maintenance.

15:36.674 --> 15:37.762
[Gabby sniffles]

15:37.806 --> 15:38.807
I'm sorry, I...

15:38.850 --> 15:39.939
I got an American hero

15:39.982 --> 15:41.592
bringing flowers
to his dead wife

15:41.636 --> 15:44.987
so they can watch
the sunset together.

15:45.031 --> 15:47.381
I'm gonna have to pull over.

15:49.644 --> 15:52.081
Ooh. This is a nice
change of pace.

15:52.125 --> 15:53.561
Glad you like it.

15:53.604 --> 15:55.824
Mm, it's pretty. Very romantic.

15:55.867 --> 15:57.826
[chuckles]
Is it? I didn't even notice.

15:57.869 --> 16:00.263
Well, as long as we don't
talk about Medicare Part D,

16:00.307 --> 16:02.787
or why your grandkids
can't pick a damn gender,

16:02.831 --> 16:04.267
I'm loving it.

16:06.704 --> 16:09.664
Well, uh... Oh.

16:09.707 --> 16:12.275
There is something
I would like to talk about.

16:12.319 --> 16:13.537
Shoot.

16:13.581 --> 16:17.150
Okay. No risk it, no biscuit.

16:17.193 --> 16:21.589
Gina, I can't even begin to say
how much you've changed my life.

16:21.632 --> 16:23.591
I am a different person,

16:23.634 --> 16:25.288
a better person because of you.

16:25.332 --> 16:27.377
Oh, Drew. I feel the same way.

16:27.421 --> 16:29.075
You bring out the best in me.

16:29.118 --> 16:31.381
That's great to hear.

16:31.425 --> 16:33.383
Because there's something

16:33.427 --> 16:34.776
I've been wanting
to tell you

16:34.819 --> 16:35.907
ever since I woke up
from the surgery...

16:35.951 --> 16:37.779
You have got to be kidding me.

16:37.822 --> 16:39.781
I am, I'm totally kidding.
[laughs]

16:39.824 --> 16:41.000
It's Eli.

16:42.088 --> 16:44.829
You've got to be kidding me.

16:44.873 --> 16:46.092
You know what? You know what?
We're broken up.

16:46.135 --> 16:47.832
He's allowed
to have dinner with a...

16:47.876 --> 16:51.662
supermodel, or some
kind of sex robot.

16:51.706 --> 16:53.490
Let's just order.
They don't even see us.

16:53.534 --> 16:56.580
Oh, here they come. Hi.

16:56.624 --> 16:58.582
Hey.[chuckles]
Hey, there.

16:58.626 --> 17:00.149
[laughter]

17:00.193 --> 17:02.151
Hey, didn't expect
to see you guys here.

17:02.195 --> 17:03.587
Small world, huh?

17:03.631 --> 17:05.459
Maybe for you two.
You're both giants.

17:05.502 --> 17:06.677
[laughs]

17:07.896 --> 17:09.985
Uh, Drew Dunbar.
Nice to meet you.

17:10.029 --> 17:11.421
Camille. Hi.

17:11.465 --> 17:13.858
Oh, I'm sorry.
Um, Camille, this is Gina.

17:13.902 --> 17:15.512
She and I, um...

17:15.556 --> 17:17.427
This is Gina.

17:17.471 --> 17:19.125
I'm Gina.

17:19.168 --> 17:20.648
[chuckles]Uh, nice to meet you.

17:20.691 --> 17:23.129
Nice to meet you, too!

17:23.172 --> 17:24.652
Okay, well, you guys
enjoy your dinner.

17:24.695 --> 17:26.219
Good to see you both.

17:26.262 --> 17:27.698
Good to see you.Good to see you!

17:30.832 --> 17:32.051
Are you okay?

17:32.094 --> 17:33.617
I will be.

17:33.661 --> 17:36.490
Oh, oh, that's more of
a sipping wine, but all right.

17:36.533 --> 17:40.537
Now let's get some
alcohol in this bitch!

17:46.195 --> 17:49.329
[grunts] Okay.Alexa, turn lights on!

17:51.331 --> 17:53.768
I don't know why I said that.

17:53.811 --> 17:56.292
I don't have an Alexa.

17:56.336 --> 17:57.859
[laughs]

17:57.902 --> 18:00.122
Let's get you on the couch.

18:00.166 --> 18:02.646
Oh, it's such a good couch.
It's long.

18:02.690 --> 18:04.039
Like Eli's girlfriend.

18:04.083 --> 18:05.388
[chuckles]

18:05.432 --> 18:08.565
There you go.
[exhales]

18:08.609 --> 18:11.264
I'm, uh, sorry
about that whole thing.

18:11.307 --> 18:14.310
It's okay. You know, I just...

18:14.354 --> 18:19.010
I thought that he'd call
and we'd work it out and...

18:19.054 --> 18:20.969
But I guess
I'm just, um...

18:22.536 --> 18:25.147
I guess I'm just the type
of girl that you date

18:25.191 --> 18:27.802
until you find somebody better.

18:27.845 --> 18:29.847
Oh, come on. There's
nobody better than you.

18:29.891 --> 18:32.285
Just longer.[chuckles]

18:32.328 --> 18:34.461
Sure.

18:34.504 --> 18:37.855
I just wish that, you know,
I could find a guy who...

18:37.899 --> 18:39.509
who gets me.

18:39.553 --> 18:40.815
Accepts me

18:40.858 --> 18:42.773
for me.
[chuckles]

18:42.817 --> 18:44.427
You'll find that guy.

18:44.471 --> 18:46.168
Will I?

18:46.212 --> 18:47.778
Absolutely.

18:47.822 --> 18:51.347
And he'll appreciate
how amazing you are,

18:51.391 --> 18:53.915
and how much happiness
you bring to other people.

18:56.222 --> 18:57.919
Drew?
Yeah?

18:57.962 --> 19:00.617
I think I found that guy.

19:02.924 --> 19:04.882
[grunts softly]

19:04.926 --> 19:07.146
This is a bad idea.

19:07.189 --> 19:09.278
Why?
Because you've had
a lot to drink.

19:09.322 --> 19:10.671
I disagree to agree.

19:10.714 --> 19:14.065
I have had exactly
the right amount.

19:14.109 --> 19:15.806
Water.

19:17.156 --> 19:18.113
Hang on.

19:18.157 --> 19:20.202
I keep tasting shrimp.

19:20.246 --> 19:21.943
Did I have shrimp?
No.

19:21.986 --> 19:25.251
Oh, that's not good.

19:25.294 --> 19:27.253
Look, uh,

19:27.296 --> 19:29.037
I've been wanting to say
something for a while now,

19:29.080 --> 19:31.387
but I'm not sure
if it's the right time.

19:31.431 --> 19:32.475
This is the right time.

19:32.519 --> 19:33.998
Okay.

19:34.042 --> 19:35.609
Well, you're wonderful.

19:35.652 --> 19:38.046
You're more than
wonderful, really.

19:38.089 --> 19:41.049
And I've been wanting
to say this for weeks,

19:41.092 --> 19:44.357
but every time I try,
I lose the nerve.

19:44.400 --> 19:47.708
The truth is...

19:47.751 --> 19:49.623
I love you, Gina.

19:51.015 --> 19:53.844
Gina?

19:53.888 --> 19:55.150
You still there?

19:57.587 --> 19:59.110
Perfect.
