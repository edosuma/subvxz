WEBVTT

00:16.725 --> 00:20.103
She agreed to have breakfast with you.
That was the best I could do.

00:20.186 --> 00:22.605
-Sorry.
-No, no, no, that's okay.

00:22.689 --> 00:24.691
That's okay. Breakfast is good.

00:27.277 --> 00:29.446
I don't think I've ever seen her
this mad at me.

00:29.529 --> 00:32.574
Oh, she's not mad at you, she's...

00:33.575 --> 00:35.535
She's upset by the situation.

00:35.618 --> 00:38.538
-Jack.
-Fine. She's really not happy with you.

00:38.621 --> 00:40.540
What am I gonna do?

00:41.332 --> 00:42.834
If Nate doesn't change his mind,

00:42.917 --> 00:44.961
I don't think she'll forgive me.

00:45.837 --> 00:48.089
I should go talk to him right now.

00:48.173 --> 00:52.218
Oh, I think we can wait till the morning.
Just let everyone cool off.

00:54.637 --> 00:55.889
Yeah, you're right.

00:56.598 --> 00:58.141
Hey, it's gonna work out.

00:58.224 --> 00:59.809
How do you know that?

00:59.893 --> 01:02.729
Because you and Joey are family
and you love each other.

01:04.022 --> 01:04.898
Yeah.

01:06.900 --> 01:09.194
What's going on?
I thought these sheets were clean.

01:09.277 --> 01:11.613
They were. I'm just...

01:11.696 --> 01:14.074
When I'm stressed, I change the bedding.

01:14.783 --> 01:16.826
I've been doing it since I was a kid.

01:16.910 --> 01:18.369
Oh, wow, that's, uh...

01:19.079 --> 01:21.164
That's very you.

01:21.873 --> 01:23.083
Mm-hm.

01:23.166 --> 01:26.795
Let me help put the sheets back on
and you can sleep.

01:29.047 --> 01:33.718
Hey, you know, we never got to finish
our conversation from earlier.

01:35.178 --> 01:36.012
Tomorrow.

01:36.721 --> 01:39.099
I think we've done enough negotiating
for one night.

01:39.182 --> 01:41.476
Yeah. Okay.

01:51.820 --> 01:55.156
Hey. Charlie? Charlie. You're okay.

01:55.240 --> 01:57.242
-He doesn't look so good.
-Yeah.

01:59.119 --> 02:00.703
I can't feel my leg.

02:00.787 --> 02:03.456
I know. We'll get you to a hospital, okay?

02:05.792 --> 02:07.794
It's light enough,
I think we can carry him.

02:07.877 --> 02:09.546
-Just us?
-He's going into shock.

02:09.629 --> 02:12.966
If we don't get him to a hospital,
his organs are gonna shut down.

02:13.049 --> 02:16.302
-Back's not great, but I'll give my all.
-Okay.

02:18.054 --> 02:20.098
-Doc!
-I brought help.

02:20.181 --> 02:21.933
Oh, just in time, Doc.

02:22.016 --> 02:24.102
The ambulance is at the trailhead.

02:25.270 --> 02:26.437
Right over there.

02:29.482 --> 02:33.236
His tibial fracture is still stable,
but he's going into shock.

02:33.319 --> 02:35.446
Clammy, weak pulse. He's very pale.

02:35.530 --> 02:36.573
Could be septic shock.

02:36.656 --> 02:39.367
-We need to get him to a hospital, stat.
-Yeah.

02:41.828 --> 02:43.621
Okay, hold this.

02:43.705 --> 02:45.415
All right, lift on three.

02:45.498 --> 02:47.584
One, two, three.

02:49.252 --> 02:51.713
-Easy, now. Easy, easy, easy.
-Watch it.

02:51.796 --> 02:53.047
Easy.

02:53.131 --> 02:54.424
-Here you go.
-Thanks.

02:54.507 --> 02:55.633
-Bert, ready?
-Go on,

02:55.717 --> 02:58.761
-I'll put the fire out, be right on.
-All right.

02:59.971 --> 03:01.431
And again on three.

03:01.514 --> 03:03.349
One, two, three.

03:29.918 --> 03:31.628
-Thank you.
-Enjoy.

03:33.129 --> 03:34.255
Nate. Hey.

03:34.339 --> 03:36.507
-Hi.
-Thanks for meeting me so early.

03:36.591 --> 03:39.135
-Sure.
-Look, I feel really terrible.

03:39.219 --> 03:42.138
I thought you knew
why Joey was upset with me,

03:42.222 --> 03:44.766
otherwise, I never would've said anything.

03:44.849 --> 03:48.978
All you did was get me to pause
and consider your take on things.

03:49.062 --> 03:52.065
But still, it's not my place
to interfere in your relationship.

03:52.148 --> 03:53.358
I'm really sorry.

03:53.441 --> 03:55.151
Getting married was my idea.

03:55.693 --> 03:57.820
After our talk, I realized that Joey

03:57.904 --> 04:00.531
might be going along
with this whole thing...

04:01.074 --> 04:02.533
just to make me happy.

04:02.617 --> 04:06.788
Oh, but, you know,
wanting you to be happy is a good thing.

04:07.956 --> 04:09.457
Not if she isn't being honest.

04:09.540 --> 04:13.127
You don't know that, and it's my fault
you're doubting her, right?

04:14.379 --> 04:16.506
Please, how can I fix it?

04:16.589 --> 04:17.590
Oh, you can't.

04:19.300 --> 04:21.052
This is between Joey and me.

04:21.594 --> 04:23.763
-Thanks.
-Okay.

04:27.934 --> 04:29.978
No, no, no.

04:30.061 --> 04:31.354
Don't go. Come on.

04:31.437 --> 04:35.984
I have a lot to do, and if I stay,
I'm not gonna get anything done.

04:36.067 --> 04:37.068
Who cares?

04:37.151 --> 04:41.281
Uh, me. Before I moved here,
I used to work 60-hour weeks.

04:41.364 --> 04:43.700
Mm. And you were cool with that?

04:45.410 --> 04:48.246
Right. How did such
a driven woman like you

04:48.329 --> 04:50.832
end up with a slacker like me?

04:51.833 --> 04:55.420
We're the perfect match.
We balance each other out.

04:56.879 --> 04:59.215
I bet you make one hell of an attorney.

05:01.134 --> 05:02.802
-Okay, bye.
-Bye.

05:09.475 --> 05:10.351
Hello?

05:13.021 --> 05:14.188
Hi.

05:17.066 --> 05:17.900
Hey.

05:18.985 --> 05:21.195
-How'd it go with Nate?
-Um...

05:22.155 --> 05:27.076
Well, he was really sweet, but there
just wasn't much to say, you know?

05:27.160 --> 05:29.037
It's just up to them now.

05:29.120 --> 05:32.749
-So you've done everything you can.
-Mm. I hope so.

05:32.832 --> 05:35.710
Well, I'm heading to work,
and then my storage unit with Ricky

05:35.793 --> 05:38.338
to see if there's anything
I can use for the Airstream.

05:38.421 --> 05:41.257
-You have a storage unit?
-Oh, I'm full of surprises.

05:41.341 --> 05:42.800
-I better get going.
-Oh.

05:43.885 --> 05:45.178
Hey, before you go,

05:45.261 --> 05:48.222
can we just talk about what happened
between us last night?

05:49.349 --> 05:53.227
-Uh, can it wait till I get back?
-I don't wanna wait the whole day.

05:55.730 --> 05:56.564
Okay.

05:59.233 --> 06:00.360
Look, I just...

06:01.444 --> 06:04.030
I don't think
you're being honest with yourself.

06:06.491 --> 06:07.450
Okay.

06:07.533 --> 06:11.704
You keep telling yourself
that if you just work harder,

06:12.330 --> 06:15.041
that you can handle everything
with Lonergan,

06:15.124 --> 06:17.335
and fighting with Charmaine and Todd,

06:17.418 --> 06:21.130
and having to make more money
for a baby you didn't expect.

06:21.214 --> 06:22.632
Well, I can.

06:23.383 --> 06:24.425
I mean, I am.

06:25.259 --> 06:27.595
Yeah, well, by self-medicating.

06:31.057 --> 06:34.227
No, that's not what I'm doing, but, um...

06:36.562 --> 06:37.397
Okay.

06:38.481 --> 06:41.901
Look, if it bothers you that much,
then I'll stop drinking.

06:43.361 --> 06:44.946
-You will?
-Mm-hm. Yeah.

06:46.864 --> 06:47.698
Okay.

06:48.658 --> 06:49.826
Okay, that's great.

06:49.909 --> 06:51.244
That's great.

06:51.327 --> 06:53.413
With alcohol abuse, it's...

06:53.496 --> 06:57.834
It's really just a symptom, you need
to find out where the pain is coming from.

06:57.917 --> 07:02.463
Okay. But right now,
this is what I can do. Okay?

07:03.005 --> 07:06.217
-If that's not enough--
-Honey, it's not about being enough.

07:08.261 --> 07:09.303
And I just--

07:09.971 --> 07:13.975
I don't want you to do this for me.
I want you to do it for you.

07:14.058 --> 07:17.228
Everything I do is for us, okay?

07:17.311 --> 07:19.063
Yeah. I know.

07:19.147 --> 07:20.565
I know.

07:20.648 --> 07:22.108
And I will do this.

07:22.900 --> 07:23.860
Okay.

07:23.943 --> 07:27.238
I gotta run. Just call me
after you speak to Joey, okay?

07:27.321 --> 07:28.156
Okay.

07:39.041 --> 07:40.334
Denny, I'm leaving.

07:40.418 --> 07:42.253
You need anything before I go?

07:42.336 --> 07:45.381
Yeah. Can I borrow one of Doc's
waterproof jackets?

07:45.465 --> 07:48.342
I wanna hike up to the falls.
Left mine at the clinic.

07:48.426 --> 07:51.137
Sure. They're in your room,
stored in a box under the bed.

07:51.220 --> 07:52.555
And Doc won't mind?

07:52.638 --> 07:55.057
He's got so many.
He wouldn't notice one was missing

07:55.141 --> 07:57.643
-if his life depended on it.
-Okay. Thanks.

07:57.727 --> 07:59.812
I'll be back in a few hours.
Enjoy your hike.

07:59.896 --> 08:00.730
Bye.

08:55.618 --> 08:57.286
How did you find this house?

08:57.370 --> 08:58.996
Nate found it on Airbnb.

08:59.080 --> 09:00.790
Wow, it's beautiful.

09:00.873 --> 09:02.750
Yeah. We're happy with it.

09:04.627 --> 09:05.461
Joe...

09:06.337 --> 09:09.257
I am so sorry.
I should've been more supportive.

09:09.340 --> 09:11.717
No, you were right.

09:11.801 --> 09:14.053
There are things
we don't know about each other.

09:14.595 --> 09:20.017
So I talked to Nate about trusting
that what we tell each other is true.

09:20.101 --> 09:21.269
What did he say?

09:21.811 --> 09:22.728
He agreed.

09:23.312 --> 09:25.481
And he said he loves me,

09:25.565 --> 09:27.942
and that if I'm truly ready...

09:29.360 --> 09:31.070
today can still be the day.

09:31.821 --> 09:33.197
-Really?
-Yeah.

09:33.281 --> 09:35.074
-So you guys are getting married?
-Yeah.

09:35.157 --> 09:36.951
-Oh, my gosh. Oh, honey.
-I know.

09:37.034 --> 09:40.079
-That's such great news.
-Yeah. It's great.

09:40.162 --> 09:41.539
Congratulations.

09:41.622 --> 09:44.166
-Thank you.
-I do have one question.

09:44.250 --> 09:46.002
-Yeah?
-Is it okay

09:46.085 --> 09:47.753
if I'm still your maid of honor?

09:48.546 --> 09:50.256
-Yes. Of course.
-Yeah?

09:50.339 --> 09:51.257
-Okay.
-Yes!

09:51.340 --> 09:54.010
Can I throw you a reception after?

09:54.093 --> 09:56.512
Oh, my God. No. No, it's so last-minute.

09:56.596 --> 09:59.432
-You don't have to.
-Oh, let me worry about that.

10:00.224 --> 10:01.559
I'm so happy for you.

10:01.642 --> 10:02.518
-Thank you.
-Really.

10:02.602 --> 10:04.103
Me too. He's great.

10:04.186 --> 10:05.313
I know.

10:05.396 --> 10:06.564
Cheers.

10:09.275 --> 10:11.235
Let me know if you need anything.

10:11.777 --> 10:12.862
Okay. Bye, now.

10:15.156 --> 10:17.658
Shirley said Bert's home,

10:17.742 --> 10:20.202
and Charlie's on his way to the hospital.

10:20.286 --> 10:23.372
The Virgin River phone tree
updates faster than Twitter.

10:23.456 --> 10:27.835
If we could limit those conversations
to 280 characters, we'd be golden.

10:28.544 --> 10:30.755
I know how to tweet. I choose not to.

10:30.838 --> 10:33.466
Oh, and for that we are all grateful.

10:33.549 --> 10:34.717
You're welcome.

10:38.929 --> 10:40.598
-Aunt Connie...
-Hmm?

10:40.681 --> 10:42.600
-Can I ask you a question?
-Yeah.

10:42.683 --> 10:43.976
Go right ahead, dear.

10:44.060 --> 10:48.648
If you found out something about someone

10:48.731 --> 10:51.525
and you were worried
they might be in danger...

10:52.610 --> 10:54.028
would you say something?

10:54.111 --> 10:56.947
Absolutely. In fact,
it's your duty to warn them.

10:57.740 --> 10:59.158
Even if it's super hard?

10:59.241 --> 11:02.495
Doing the right thing
is usually super hard.

11:04.330 --> 11:05.164
Thanks.

11:12.963 --> 11:13.964
Hey, Mel.

11:15.758 --> 11:17.051
Wow, okay.

11:18.177 --> 11:20.012
Yeah, yeah, we'd love to come.

11:20.846 --> 11:22.515
Yep. Okay.

11:23.057 --> 11:23.933
Bye.

11:25.351 --> 11:26.310
-Hey.
-Hey.

11:26.394 --> 11:27.228
What's up?

11:27.311 --> 11:29.605
-So remember that bondsman's assistant?
-Mm-hm.

11:29.689 --> 11:32.566
She called with a description
of the donor who bailed out Brady:

11:32.650 --> 11:34.902
Female, expensive suit, drives an SUV.

11:34.985 --> 11:37.613
-She get a plate number?
-She got a picture.

11:38.155 --> 11:39.907
Oh, nicely done.

11:39.990 --> 11:42.702
Okay. I'm gonna run that
through the system.

11:43.911 --> 11:46.497
-Uh...
-I don't even wanna know how...

11:46.580 --> 11:48.541
The car is registered
to Melissa Montgomery,

11:48.624 --> 11:51.502
3114 Mayfield Avenue, San Diego.

11:51.585 --> 11:53.921
Okay. I still have a friend
or two at the SDPD.

11:54.004 --> 11:55.673
-I'll check into it.
-Great.

11:55.756 --> 11:57.758
-Any word on Calvin's boat?
-We are searching

11:57.842 --> 12:01.387
every body of water within
a 50-mile radius of Emerald Lumber.

12:01.470 --> 12:03.931
If he's living on a boat, we'll find him.

12:04.014 --> 12:06.350
-All right, you'll let me know? Thanks.
-Mm-hm.

12:06.434 --> 12:07.268
All right.

12:16.110 --> 12:17.236
How'd it go with Joey?

12:17.319 --> 12:19.155
<i>Well, the wedding is back on.</i>

12:19.238 --> 12:21.949
Aw. See, I told you it would work out.

12:22.032 --> 12:24.201
Yes, you did.

12:24.285 --> 12:26.245
Don't know what I would've done
without you.

12:26.328 --> 12:28.748
<i>You'd have gone through a lot of sheets.</i>

12:28.831 --> 12:30.541
Yeah, probably would have.

12:31.459 --> 12:34.295
Uh, also,
so instead of going to city hall,

12:34.378 --> 12:37.047
I am organizing a surprise ceremony.

12:37.131 --> 12:39.383
Do you have time to pull all that off?

12:39.467 --> 12:41.385
<i>Well, Jo Ellen is gonna help me.</i>

12:41.469 --> 12:44.138
You sure you're not putting yourself
under pressure?

12:44.221 --> 12:45.681
No, no, not at all.

12:45.765 --> 12:47.600
This is something I wanna do for her.

12:47.683 --> 12:48.934
Okay. Well, great.

12:49.018 --> 12:51.187
I'll have Preacher
send over some champagne.

12:51.270 --> 12:53.439
<i>Aw. Thank you, that's really sweet.</i>

12:53.522 --> 12:56.525
Also, if you have time this afternoon,

12:56.609 --> 12:58.944
could you maybe hang out with Nate?

12:59.028 --> 13:03.032
Joey's going to get her nails done
and he doesn't know anybody here.

13:03.115 --> 13:05.034
Yeah, sure. Send me his number.

13:05.117 --> 13:06.368
Great. Thanks.

13:07.328 --> 13:08.537
Uh, the wedding's at 6:00,

13:08.621 --> 13:12.124
so just have him back in time
to get ready and, um...

13:12.666 --> 13:13.751
I'll meet you there.

13:13.834 --> 13:15.419
Promise me one thing?

13:15.503 --> 13:17.505
<i>-What?</i>
-Save me a dance, will you?

13:17.588 --> 13:21.091
-Babe, you can have all the dances.
<i>-I'm gonna hold you to that. Better go.</i>

13:21.175 --> 13:23.219
<i>-I love you.</i>
-Okay. I love you too.

13:23.302 --> 13:24.178
-Bye.
<i>-Bye.</i>

13:29.892 --> 13:31.352
Table 9 needs waters all around.

13:31.435 --> 13:32.603
-Got it.
-Thanks.

13:33.854 --> 13:35.606
And here we go.

13:35.689 --> 13:38.651
-There's a bunch of water back here.
-Huh?

13:40.945 --> 13:44.824
Oh. Damn, I think we might have a leak.

13:44.907 --> 13:47.284
Once the customers finish up,
put up the closed sign.

13:47.368 --> 13:49.286
-I'll shut off the water.
-Okay.

13:53.332 --> 13:54.416
Hey, you're back.

13:54.500 --> 13:56.836
-Hey.
-Hey, how's Charlie doing?

13:56.919 --> 14:00.297
He's in the hospital in stable condition.

14:00.381 --> 14:01.966
That's fantastic news.

14:02.842 --> 14:04.176
How are you guys holding up?

14:04.260 --> 14:05.511
I feel okay.

14:05.594 --> 14:08.389
I guess those overnight shifts
in the hospital paid off.

14:08.472 --> 14:09.807
I remember those days.

14:09.890 --> 14:12.935
Those schedules were a young man's game.

14:13.018 --> 14:15.104
Uh, which includes you.

14:15.646 --> 14:18.566
In the last 12 hours,
you've hiked, what, like 16 miles?

14:20.943 --> 14:23.487
Why are you so chipper? Thanks.

14:23.571 --> 14:27.032
Well, my sister's in town, and...

14:27.575 --> 14:30.703
long story short,
I'm throwing her a surprise wedding.

14:30.786 --> 14:33.664
Oh, well, tell her congratulations
from me.

14:33.747 --> 14:36.458
I will. Do you mind
if I run some errands at lunch?

14:36.542 --> 14:38.836
I have to pick up
the wedding dress, flowers...

14:38.919 --> 14:40.462
I could cover for you.

14:40.546 --> 14:42.381
Why not take the whole day off?

14:42.464 --> 14:43.924
Are you sure you won't be too tired?

14:44.008 --> 14:45.634
Come on, I'm fine.

14:45.718 --> 14:46.719
Works for me.

14:46.802 --> 14:49.597
I'm gonna go take a shower and rest a bit,

14:49.680 --> 14:51.557
then be back so you can take a break.

14:51.640 --> 14:52.892
Perfect.

14:52.975 --> 14:54.310
Okay, great.

14:54.393 --> 14:56.645
Amazing. Thanks for covering.

14:57.438 --> 15:00.190
Oh, and I would love it
if you would come to the wedding.

15:00.274 --> 15:03.027
That's if you're not too exhausted.

15:03.110 --> 15:05.446
I'll just check to make sure
Hope's feeling okay,

15:05.529 --> 15:06.697
but we'll do our best.

15:06.780 --> 15:09.783
Just because I'm here,
don't feel obligated to invite me.

15:09.867 --> 15:12.453
Come on. With you,
it's never an obligation.

15:12.536 --> 15:14.830
Well, in that case, I'll be there.

15:14.914 --> 15:18.250
Great. If you guys need anything,
give me a call.

15:18.334 --> 15:19.835
And... yeah.

15:19.919 --> 15:21.837
Thanks again. Bye.

15:30.054 --> 15:30.888
What?

15:32.222 --> 15:36.810
Well, there are a million reasons
to love Virgin River...

15:37.561 --> 15:41.148
and for your sake,
I hope she is not one of them.

15:42.107 --> 15:43.901
Mel and I are just colleagues.

15:43.984 --> 15:45.277
Good.

15:46.820 --> 15:48.739
I'll let Hope know we're back.

15:56.372 --> 15:57.581
Yoo-hoo.

15:58.916 --> 16:00.125
What are you doing here?

16:00.209 --> 16:04.088
Well, you know,
this weather is perfect for planting.

16:06.882 --> 16:08.801
What's, uh-- What's all this?

16:09.343 --> 16:11.637
-I'm putting together a bench.

16:11.720 --> 16:14.682
What a lovely idea.

16:14.765 --> 16:16.767
I'd be happy to help you put it together.

16:16.850 --> 16:19.770
Have you ever in your life
put something together?

16:19.853 --> 16:24.733
Yes. As a thespian,
I have built my fair share of stage sets.

16:24.817 --> 16:26.694
In fact, if I didn't look like this,

16:26.777 --> 16:29.571
I probably would have gone
into set design.

16:29.655 --> 16:30.948
Uh-huh.

16:31.031 --> 16:32.449
I prefer to work alone.

16:32.533 --> 16:35.202
Oh, Hope. Come on, please.
I really wanna help.

16:35.285 --> 16:37.663
Fine, just don't get in the way.

16:37.746 --> 16:38.872
Okay!

16:38.956 --> 16:40.290
So, um...

16:40.874 --> 16:43.585
where are the instructions, then?

16:43.669 --> 16:45.045
We don't need them.

16:46.714 --> 16:48.882
Are you sure? Because they all...

16:48.966 --> 16:51.969
They're all the same color,
and with your--

16:52.886 --> 16:55.723
With my what? My TBI?
Is that what you're talking about?

16:55.806 --> 16:59.059
No! No, I was gonna say, with your bench--

17:01.270 --> 17:02.813
There's a lot of screws.

17:03.564 --> 17:04.690
Nice save.

17:04.773 --> 17:07.568
So are you in or out?

17:07.651 --> 17:08.902
Oh, I'm in.

17:08.986 --> 17:11.113
And we are gonna do it your way.

17:25.836 --> 17:26.837
Hello?

17:46.607 --> 17:49.234
Hey. How's your friend Charlie?

17:49.318 --> 17:53.280
I'm told he'll make a complete recovery,
thank you for asking.

17:54.239 --> 17:56.200
Do you need anything?
Can I make you lunch?

17:56.283 --> 17:59.953
I appreciate the offer, but I'll scavenge
something after my shower.

18:00.037 --> 18:02.039
Okay. I'm just leaving to go on a hike.

18:02.122 --> 18:05.084
Before you go, there's something
I wanna talk to you about.

18:06.877 --> 18:09.129
I know about the drug cabinet.

18:09.213 --> 18:10.881
Now, Mel didn't tattle.

18:10.964 --> 18:12.257
There was a security issue,

18:12.341 --> 18:15.052
I pressured her
into telling me what happened.

18:15.135 --> 18:16.595
I asked her not to say anything.

18:16.678 --> 18:18.889
I didn't want you to think
I was some criminal.

18:19.723 --> 18:22.559
I had a headache
and I wasn't thinking clearly.

18:22.643 --> 18:26.897
How did you get the cabinet open?
And please be honest.

18:28.273 --> 18:30.275
I used my Swiss Army knife.

18:30.359 --> 18:32.111
I'm so sorry.

18:32.194 --> 18:35.781
I was afraid that if I told you the truth,
you wouldn't trust me anymore.

18:37.991 --> 18:38.909
Well...

18:40.994 --> 18:44.498
How about we consider this
an isolated incident...

18:45.249 --> 18:49.628
and assume that nothing like this
will ever, ever happen again?

18:49.711 --> 18:52.881
Of course. Thanks for understanding.

18:52.965 --> 18:54.508
You just remember:

18:55.217 --> 18:59.429
Trust is hard to build, easy to break.

19:00.180 --> 19:02.266
Don't worry. I won't let you down.

19:05.185 --> 19:06.895
-Have a nice hike.
-Thanks.

19:20.325 --> 19:21.869
Where'd you get all this stuff?

19:21.952 --> 19:23.662
Most of it came
from my grandparents.

19:23.745 --> 19:25.080
Why do you still have it?

19:25.164 --> 19:27.875
When they died, no one else wanted it,
I didn't wanna sell it,

19:27.958 --> 19:30.586
so I put it in storage.
I forgot it was here.

19:30.669 --> 19:33.213
I haven't been here
for four or five years.

19:33.297 --> 19:35.257
So, what are we looking for?

19:35.340 --> 19:37.384
Anything to decorate an Airstream.

19:38.969 --> 19:40.053
What about this?

19:42.181 --> 19:44.099
It's a little much, I think.

19:44.850 --> 19:45.684
Okay.

19:47.186 --> 19:49.313
Uh, how about these?

19:51.190 --> 19:53.066
Those could work. Put those out there,

19:53.150 --> 19:55.986
-that can be the "take" pile.
-Okay.

20:00.115 --> 20:02.743
Man, it's like digging
through buried treasure in here.

20:02.826 --> 20:05.871
You know what they say, one man's trash...

20:05.954 --> 20:09.166
This reminds me of a show
called <i>Storage Wars.</i>

20:09.249 --> 20:10.542
There was this one episode

20:10.626 --> 20:15.172
where this guy found this, like,
World War II minesweeper thing...

20:17.007 --> 20:19.468
Jack. Jack.

20:19.551 --> 20:21.261
Jack, what do you think?

20:22.012 --> 20:22.888
Huh?

20:25.265 --> 20:27.476
Yeah. I think we're done here.

20:27.559 --> 20:29.937
What do you mean?
We just took out the cushions.

20:30.020 --> 20:32.105
Yeah, we can come back another day.

20:32.898 --> 20:35.234
Okay. Well, I guess I'll go, then.

20:35.943 --> 20:37.361
Yeah. Thanks for your help.

20:37.444 --> 20:38.487
Yeah, no problem.

20:43.450 --> 20:44.993
It looks stunning.

20:45.077 --> 20:47.079
Although the hemline's a little short.

20:47.162 --> 20:49.706
Oh, this is gonna fit my sister perfectly.

20:49.790 --> 20:51.959
Hi. I'm here for the dress fitting.

20:52.042 --> 20:54.670
Certainly. Right away, Miss Masry.

20:54.753 --> 20:58.423
Oh, hi. Wait, what are you doing here?

20:59.132 --> 21:00.133
Hi, Charmaine.

21:01.510 --> 21:02.511
Thanks.

21:02.594 --> 21:03.762
If you're not in a hurry,

21:03.845 --> 21:06.014
I can steam your dress and pack it to go.

21:06.098 --> 21:08.267
A surprise wedding. So romantic!

21:08.350 --> 21:09.184
Yeah.

21:13.480 --> 21:14.856
So...

21:15.565 --> 21:17.025
You and Jack...

21:17.901 --> 21:19.152
getting married?

21:19.236 --> 21:21.822
No, the dress is for my sister.

21:22.531 --> 21:25.450
You don't have to lie.
It's not like I'm shocked.

21:26.118 --> 21:27.327
I'm not lying.

21:27.411 --> 21:30.664
I'm throwing my sister
a surprise wedding tonight.

21:30.747 --> 21:33.166
-Your sister from L.A.?
-Mm-hm.

21:33.250 --> 21:35.627
-She's getting married here?
-Yes, she is.

21:36.211 --> 21:38.505
How long has she been engaged for?

21:38.588 --> 21:41.091
Actually, I don't-- I'm not sure.

21:41.883 --> 21:46.596
So you don't know
when your sister got engaged...

21:47.139 --> 21:49.766
and you're throwing her
a surprise wedding in Virgin River?

21:49.850 --> 21:52.728
-It's a very unusual situation.
-Mm-hm.

21:52.811 --> 21:54.521
Look, I'm married.

21:54.604 --> 21:56.315
You're obviously getting married.

21:56.398 --> 21:58.066
There's nothing left to fight over.

21:58.150 --> 22:00.068
We should just be honest with each other.

22:00.152 --> 22:01.653
Yeah, I agree.

22:02.738 --> 22:05.365
You stealing Jack
was honestly the best thing

22:05.449 --> 22:07.159
that could've ever happened to me.

22:07.242 --> 22:09.828
He never would've loved me
the way that he loves you.

22:09.911 --> 22:13.373
-Charmaine.
-No. You don't understand.

22:13.915 --> 22:15.959
What I'm saying is, I forgive you.

22:16.918 --> 22:21.214
And, I don't know, maybe one day
we could become friends. So...

22:22.507 --> 22:24.176
All steamed and ready to go.

22:24.259 --> 22:26.386
Oh, thank you. Thanks.

22:26.470 --> 22:28.263
I'm glad that I ran into you,

22:28.347 --> 22:31.850
and I hope your sister
has a wonderful wedding.

22:37.397 --> 22:41.693
Hope, it's beautiful.
And we put it together so quickly.

22:41.777 --> 22:44.571
You're not mad
that I threw away the directions?

22:44.654 --> 22:48.075
-No, not in the least.
-Okay, that's it.

22:48.158 --> 22:49.368
The jig's up.

22:49.451 --> 22:50.952
Whatever do you mean?

22:51.453 --> 22:55.415
You've been treating me
like a Ming vase all damn day.

22:55.499 --> 22:57.167
What are you talking about?

22:57.626 --> 23:02.672
We've got six leftover screws
and you haven't said a word.

23:03.548 --> 23:06.385
I was supporting your process.

23:06.468 --> 23:10.680
You never supported my process
before my accident.

23:10.764 --> 23:12.015
Spill it, blondie.

23:13.058 --> 23:17.354
Okay, I did a little research on TBIs,
and in your presence,

23:17.437 --> 23:20.774
I am to have a calm and friendly demeanor.

23:20.857 --> 23:24.486
That's horse crap,
but I appreciate the effort.

23:25.570 --> 23:31.618
What I need is occasional seclusion
and for people to act normal around me.

23:32.285 --> 23:33.203
Fair enough.

23:33.286 --> 23:36.832
I will stop tiptoeing around you,
<i>tout de suite.</i>

23:37.541 --> 23:39.209
But it really is beautiful.

23:39.292 --> 23:40.752
Isn't it? I know.

23:43.505 --> 23:46.425
I told you we should have
followed instructions.

23:46.508 --> 23:49.177
-That's more like it.
-Oh, honestly.

23:50.220 --> 23:51.054
Okay.

23:51.763 --> 23:53.473
Hannah, lift on three.

23:54.266 --> 23:55.767
-Three.

23:57.352 --> 24:00.689
-You're freakishly strong.
-I know. Thank you.

24:02.607 --> 24:03.483
Here.

24:04.860 --> 24:07.070
-There's a knife.
-Hold on.

24:07.154 --> 24:08.864
Don't touch it.

24:10.490 --> 24:11.450
What's on it?

24:11.533 --> 24:12.868
Looks like blood.

24:13.535 --> 24:14.661
Gross.

24:20.208 --> 24:24.171
Hey, Mike. Need you at the bar, ASAP.

24:30.260 --> 24:32.137
I got to admit, I'm a little jealous.

24:32.846 --> 24:33.680
Hmm?

24:34.222 --> 24:36.266
I would love to own a bar up here.

24:36.349 --> 24:38.351
Not be so tied to my phone all the time.

24:38.977 --> 24:40.228
Why, what do you do?

24:41.646 --> 24:43.398
Residential real estate.

24:43.482 --> 24:45.150
Not exactly my dream job.

24:45.233 --> 24:46.151
No?

24:46.234 --> 24:47.527
Why, what is?

24:48.612 --> 24:50.363
I was gonna go to business school,

24:50.447 --> 24:52.657
but about a month before
we were supposed to start,

24:52.741 --> 24:55.243
I had a death in the family.

24:55.327 --> 24:56.786
I'm sorry to hear that.

24:57.454 --> 24:58.371
Yeah, thanks.

24:58.872 --> 25:00.832
It really blew me off course.

25:00.916 --> 25:02.334
I ended up withdrawing,

25:02.417 --> 25:04.628
traveling around the country
in a rusty old RV.

25:05.462 --> 25:06.630
Yeah, well...

25:07.380 --> 25:09.007
Grief has a way of doing that.

25:10.342 --> 25:11.259
Yeah.

25:12.469 --> 25:14.846
And never really got back on track,

25:14.930 --> 25:18.225
but I had a friend in real estate,
and it looked easy.

25:18.808 --> 25:19.684
And is it?

25:19.768 --> 25:20.810
Easy?

25:20.894 --> 25:23.939
No, not really. But I make a good living.

25:24.564 --> 25:26.608
Eh. Sounds like you figured it out.

25:28.485 --> 25:29.486
Had to.

25:30.111 --> 25:31.780
Yeah, life goes on, right?

25:32.864 --> 25:34.157
Yeah, sure does.

25:34.991 --> 25:37.244
Sorry, man, I didn't mean to bum you out.

25:37.327 --> 25:38.286
No.

25:38.370 --> 25:41.873
We're supposed to be celebrating.
Oh, wait, toasting with water's bad luck.

25:42.499 --> 25:43.625
A couple of shots?

25:43.708 --> 25:44.584
Whiskey?

25:45.126 --> 25:48.547
-No, I'm good. Thanks.
-Come on, man, it's my wedding day.

25:49.089 --> 25:50.423
You can't let me drink alone.

25:58.598 --> 26:01.560
-Preach.
-Hey. It's just over here.

26:03.853 --> 26:05.564
-Where?
-Under the sink.

26:09.693 --> 26:11.653
-Anyone touch it?
-No.

26:13.613 --> 26:15.615
You think it's connected
to Jack's shooting?

26:15.699 --> 26:21.413
Uh, I won't know anything
until we run it through the lab.

26:26.501 --> 26:30.088
Deputies went over
every inch of this place.

26:30.171 --> 26:32.549
If there wasn't a leak,
it'd still be stuck under there.

26:34.593 --> 26:39.848
Preach, do me a favor,
don't tell Jack till the results are in,

26:39.931 --> 26:42.309
just in case it turns out to be nothing.

26:42.392 --> 26:43.893
Yeah, I get it.

26:44.394 --> 26:46.229
-Won't say a word.
-All right.

26:46.313 --> 26:47.147
Night.

26:57.324 --> 26:58.241
Hey.

26:58.825 --> 27:00.201
Oh, hey.

27:00.285 --> 27:02.412
I didn't think you'd be back
from work yet.

27:02.495 --> 27:04.998
Yeah, Jeb had everything under control,

27:05.081 --> 27:07.375
so thought I'd cut out early.

27:07.459 --> 27:08.293
Huh.

27:09.836 --> 27:13.340
So, what do you wanna do tonight?

27:13.423 --> 27:17.052
Actually, we were invited to a wedding.

27:17.135 --> 27:18.094
A wedding?

27:18.511 --> 27:19.846
Who's getting married?

27:19.929 --> 27:21.348
Mel's sister, Joey.

27:21.431 --> 27:22.265
Joey?

27:23.391 --> 27:24.225
Hmm.

27:24.684 --> 27:26.186
Kind of last-minute, huh?

27:26.853 --> 27:29.064
Ah. I think it's kind of romantic.

27:29.481 --> 27:30.649
Yeah, I'm...

27:31.483 --> 27:33.026
not a big wedding guy.

27:33.902 --> 27:34.778
Right.

27:35.236 --> 27:36.780
And Jack's gonna be there.

27:37.822 --> 27:38.948
And there's that.

27:39.032 --> 27:41.576
Come on, there'll be
other people there too,

27:41.660 --> 27:44.621
you guys don't even
have to talk to each other.

27:46.081 --> 27:49.376
I'm sorry, I'm just not up for it.

27:50.710 --> 27:53.129
Okay. I'll go by myself.

27:53.213 --> 27:56.049
Or you could stay here.

27:57.634 --> 27:58.968
I'll make you dinner.

27:59.052 --> 27:59.928
I can't.

28:00.011 --> 28:02.681
I promised Mel. But don't worry about it.

28:10.188 --> 28:12.107
Sorry, I'm running late.

28:12.190 --> 28:13.024
I'm so sorry.

28:13.108 --> 28:15.610
I called the clerk at city hall.
They can stay till 6:00.

28:15.694 --> 28:18.655
-Okay. Well, change of plans.
-Oh.

28:18.738 --> 28:24.494
I know I said just the reception,
but I may have included your vows.

28:24.577 --> 28:26.121
You may have?

28:27.372 --> 28:30.333
This is for you,

28:30.417 --> 28:32.377
but only if you want to wear it.

28:33.002 --> 28:34.796
-It's beautiful.
-Okay.

28:36.172 --> 28:37.465
And this is for you.

28:37.549 --> 28:41.344
-You did not have to get me anything.
-I wanted it to be special.

28:41.428 --> 28:42.429
Honey.

28:48.768 --> 28:50.937
-They were Mom's.
-Yeah.

28:51.938 --> 28:55.817
So now you have something borrowed,
something blue, and something old.

28:56.484 --> 28:57.944
-I mean, the dress is new.
-Yeah.

28:58.570 --> 29:00.739
-Thank you. They're perfect.
-You're welcome.

29:00.822 --> 29:02.198
-Sweetheart.
-Thank you.

29:02.282 --> 29:03.324
You're welcome.

29:03.408 --> 29:04.868
-I love you.
-I love you too.

29:36.733 --> 29:38.026
Hey, are you ready?

29:38.109 --> 29:39.402
Hold your horses.

29:39.486 --> 29:41.154
Oh!

29:41.237 --> 29:42.530
Oh, what?

29:42.614 --> 29:44.991
I bought you that dress five years ago,

29:45.074 --> 29:47.202
and you've never worn it once.

29:47.285 --> 29:48.995
And if I remember correctly,

29:49.078 --> 29:53.041
you said it made you look like
mutton dressed as lamb.

29:53.917 --> 29:55.919
Well, there's a first time for everything.

29:56.002 --> 29:57.670
Yeah, I think I was right.

29:57.754 --> 29:59.005
You look beautiful.

30:01.925 --> 30:03.760
-I'm glad you think so.
-Yeah.

30:04.219 --> 30:05.720
-You ready?
-I am.

30:05.804 --> 30:06.679
Okay.

30:07.222 --> 30:10.391
Oh, uh, Denny left the light on, hold on.

30:38.419 --> 30:42.257
So you'd like to close this out
in one transaction?

30:42.340 --> 30:44.592
Yes, if that's not a problem.

30:44.676 --> 30:47.387
Not at all.
We just don't get many of these requests.

30:47.470 --> 30:48.888
It's a lot of money.

30:49.681 --> 30:53.226
Well, here's the bank name
and the account number

30:53.309 --> 30:55.144
and the routing number for the transfer.

30:55.228 --> 30:57.480
Provided you have enough
funds in this account--

30:57.564 --> 31:00.900
-There's more than enough.
-Then everything should be in order.

31:01.484 --> 31:03.903
I'll contact you
once the transfer is complete.

31:03.987 --> 31:05.947
That'd be great. Thank you.

31:07.073 --> 31:08.157
My pleasure.

31:08.241 --> 31:10.076
Enjoy the rest of the day, Mr. Mullins.

31:10.869 --> 31:11.828
You too.

31:59.751 --> 32:01.085
Isn't she beautiful?

32:01.836 --> 32:03.379
Uh, yeah.

32:09.469 --> 32:11.721
I didn't know that Nick was ordained.

32:11.804 --> 32:13.723
According to the World Wide Web, he is.

32:13.806 --> 32:15.475
You could be too.

32:31.491 --> 32:32.742
Thank you.

32:37.455 --> 32:39.207
-Hi.
-Hi.

32:39.874 --> 32:42.585
Dearly beloved, we're gathered here today

32:42.669 --> 32:47.757
to join this man, Nate Brenner,
and this woman, Joey Barnes,

32:47.840 --> 32:49.175
in holy matrimony.

32:49.842 --> 32:52.136
-The bride is absolutely stunning...
-Hey.

32:53.513 --> 32:54.931
Thanks for coming.

32:55.807 --> 32:58.184
-And she said yes.
-If it isn't already clear...

32:58.267 --> 33:00.895
-...I'd do anything for you.

33:00.979 --> 33:04.607
Nate and Joey, I understand
you've written your own vows?

33:04.691 --> 33:06.943
-Yes.
-Joey, you may begin.

33:07.485 --> 33:09.070
Okay.

33:10.905 --> 33:15.576
Nate, I promise to share
my whole heart with you

33:16.160 --> 33:19.706
and to love you fiercely and loyally.

33:28.131 --> 33:29.966
-Hi.
-Hey.

33:30.049 --> 33:32.343
So you can plan a wedding in a day?

33:32.427 --> 33:36.222
Yeah, well, thanks to Jo Ellen
and everybody else.

33:36.305 --> 33:38.099
Okay. Well, I'll have to remember that,

33:38.182 --> 33:40.059
because I'll be surprising you and Jack.

33:40.143 --> 33:42.645
-Oh, really? Do you promise?
-Mm-hm. Oh, yeah.

33:43.229 --> 33:45.481
Speaking of, have you seen my brother?

33:45.565 --> 33:48.192
Brady's here, I wanna make sure
everything is cool.

33:48.276 --> 33:50.069
Um, no, I haven't, actually,

33:50.153 --> 33:52.530
and I'm starting to get a little worried.

33:52.613 --> 33:54.073
Why? Haven't you heard from him?

33:54.157 --> 33:55.992
Well, he said he was running late, but--

33:56.951 --> 33:59.787
It's probably something at the bar.
Or maybe his phone died.

33:59.871 --> 34:00.788
Yeah.

34:02.081 --> 34:04.917
-It's going to be fine.
-You're right. You're right, I know.

34:06.753 --> 34:08.755
-You look great.
-So do you.

34:14.218 --> 34:15.386
Hey, Nate.

34:15.470 --> 34:17.722
-Mel.
-Congratulations again.

34:17.805 --> 34:20.600
-Thanks for planning all this.
-Yeah, of course.

34:20.683 --> 34:24.145
I'm really glad that you and Joey
were able to work it out.

34:24.854 --> 34:25.813
Yeah.

34:25.897 --> 34:28.357
When was the last time that you saw Jack?

34:28.441 --> 34:32.070
When he dropped me off.
He had to run home and shower.

34:32.153 --> 34:33.154
Oh, okay.

34:33.237 --> 34:34.280
How did he seem?

34:34.363 --> 34:36.866
-Uh, he was totally fine.
-Okay.

34:37.492 --> 34:40.411
-Why? He's not here?
-No, not yet.

34:40.495 --> 34:41.412
-Just...
-Hey.

34:41.496 --> 34:43.831
-Hi.
-Hi. What are you two up to?

34:43.915 --> 34:46.542
I was asking Nate
if he knew where Jack was.

34:46.626 --> 34:48.336
-Is something wrong?
-No, no.

34:48.419 --> 34:49.462
No, everything's fine.

34:49.545 --> 34:50.630
-Okay.
-Yeah.

34:50.713 --> 34:53.174
Um, I'm gonna go take care of some stuff.

34:53.257 --> 34:54.509
-Okay.
-You guys have fun.

34:56.135 --> 34:57.637
-Hi.
-Hi.

34:57.720 --> 35:02.266
-I can't believe you haven't told him.
-I haven't found the right moment.

35:02.350 --> 35:04.727
Well, either you tell Doc, or I will.

35:04.811 --> 35:05.978
Tell Doc what?

35:07.146 --> 35:09.732
-She's happy Charlie's on the mend.
-Ah.

35:09.816 --> 35:11.776
How long is he going to be
in the hospital?

35:11.859 --> 35:13.778
Well, his orthopedist isn't sure,

35:13.861 --> 35:16.656
but I'm headed over there tomorrow
to follow up.

35:16.739 --> 35:18.783
It's a miracle
he didn't crack his head open.

35:18.866 --> 35:20.326
If he had fallen head-first--

35:20.409 --> 35:22.036
You heard Doc, he's gonna be okay.

35:22.120 --> 35:23.788
Well, if he needs anything,

35:23.871 --> 35:25.331
Jo Ellen and I are happy to pay

35:25.414 --> 35:27.291
for whatever the insurance doesn't cover.

35:27.375 --> 35:29.168
Well, that is very generous of you.

35:29.252 --> 35:31.546
We consider you all family.

35:32.672 --> 35:34.048
I say we toast to that.

35:34.132 --> 35:35.466
Marvelous idea.

35:35.550 --> 35:38.678
-Yeah.
-To good friends and great neighbors.

35:38.761 --> 35:40.221
Hear, hear.

35:44.475 --> 35:45.726
It was nice seeing you.

35:53.401 --> 35:56.737
Whatever this is,
stalling only makes it worse.

35:56.821 --> 35:59.699
Ricky was right, you are a tiny ninja.

36:00.533 --> 36:02.827
Just take care of business.

36:09.917 --> 36:11.127
Hello there, Lizzie.

36:11.210 --> 36:12.295
-Hi, Doc.
-Hey.

36:12.753 --> 36:14.755
What did you think of the wedding?

36:14.839 --> 36:16.591
Oh, it was very nice.

36:16.674 --> 36:18.301
And how about the food?

36:18.384 --> 36:20.469
I don't know, haven't tried it yet.

36:23.181 --> 36:24.223
Are you okay?

36:24.724 --> 36:28.686
I don't know if I should be
telling you this, but it's about Denny.

36:28.769 --> 36:31.397
He asked me to get his charger
and I couldn't find it,

36:31.480 --> 36:35.860
so I started looking in the desk drawer
and I found a bottle of Klonopin.

36:36.819 --> 36:38.863
It was prescribed to someone else.

36:39.947 --> 36:41.657
I know people who use it to get high.

36:42.033 --> 36:43.075
Yeah...

36:45.119 --> 36:46.287
Well, thank you.

36:46.370 --> 36:47.872
Thank you for telling me.

37:01.636 --> 37:02.678
You look sad.

37:03.888 --> 37:05.723
-Just tired.
-Mm.

37:12.104 --> 37:14.982
I got my enlistment contract.

37:16.234 --> 37:17.610
I'm leaving in about a week.

37:19.445 --> 37:20.780
Congratulations.

37:22.448 --> 37:25.993
Yeah, I just wanted you to know that...

37:26.702 --> 37:28.704
you're one of the best people in my life,

37:28.788 --> 37:33.584
and I am such an idiot for screwing it up.

37:33.668 --> 37:34.919
Well, that's true.

37:35.586 --> 37:36.796
It was idiotic.

37:39.048 --> 37:40.716
I was just wondering,

37:40.800 --> 37:45.554
since I can't have my phone at boot camp,
could I write you letters?

37:45.638 --> 37:48.182
If you promise to come back in one piece.

37:48.808 --> 37:49.934
I'll do my best.

37:51.018 --> 37:52.853
I'm gonna miss you, dummy.

37:54.563 --> 37:55.690
I'm gonna miss you too.

38:12.039 --> 38:13.416
-Hey.
-Hi.

38:14.417 --> 38:17.169
-Did you hear back from Jack?
-Uh, no, not yet.

38:19.547 --> 38:22.883
Jo Ellen says it's time
for the bride and groom

38:22.967 --> 38:24.760
to have their first dance.

38:25.636 --> 38:26.721
Shall we?

38:44.989 --> 38:46.657
Come on, everyone, join us.

38:50.286 --> 38:54.290
-Hey, you look beautiful.
-I'm glad you think so.

38:56.083 --> 38:57.918
Come on, let's dance.

38:58.002 --> 38:58.961
Okay.

39:09.221 --> 39:11.891
Preach, hey, hey, it's me.

39:11.974 --> 39:14.810
I called earlier,
but you didn't call me back.

39:14.894 --> 39:15.895
Is Jack with you?

39:15.978 --> 39:18.230
<i>No, I thought he was with you.</i>

39:18.314 --> 39:19.523
He's not here yet.

39:20.149 --> 39:21.650
He said he was gonna be late,

39:21.734 --> 39:25.112
but I can't imagine he would be this late

39:25.196 --> 39:26.906
unless something happened to him.

39:26.989 --> 39:28.991
<i>All right, hang tight.</i>
<i>I'll make some calls.</i>

39:29.075 --> 39:30.451
Okay. Thank you.

39:34.246 --> 39:36.165
-Hey.
-Oh, hey.

39:36.248 --> 39:38.459
-Is Jack here?
-No, not yet.

39:38.959 --> 39:42.380
I hope he doesn't miss the cake cutting,
that's the best part.

39:42.463 --> 39:43.506
Right.

39:48.052 --> 39:49.345
You okay?

39:50.221 --> 39:51.764
Yeah, it's embarrassing.

39:52.306 --> 39:55.017
Oh, come on. I promise I won't be judgy.

39:57.520 --> 39:59.105
I thought at this stage of my life,

39:59.188 --> 40:01.690
I'd at least have a plus one.

40:01.774 --> 40:03.692
I know it makes me sound like a sap,

40:03.776 --> 40:08.239
but I want what they have, you know?

40:09.198 --> 40:11.158
The chance to build a life with someone.

40:13.077 --> 40:16.205
Wanting to have
a meaningful relationship isn't sappy.

40:20.501 --> 40:22.002
That's interesting.

40:23.170 --> 40:25.214
No, they work together.

40:25.923 --> 40:28.968
Oh, that guy wants to be
more than just colleagues.

40:29.051 --> 40:30.803
Oh, yeah? How do you know?

40:30.886 --> 40:34.765
Well, the way he looks at her.

40:36.976 --> 40:41.355
Mel, would you mind
if I stole the good doctor for a dance?

40:41.439 --> 40:43.941
-Of course not.
-It'd be my pleasure.

40:44.024 --> 40:45.317
Oh!

41:17.099 --> 41:18.225
-Oh, hey.
-Hi.

41:18.309 --> 41:20.186
Thank you so much for everything.

41:20.269 --> 41:22.771
Oh, my gosh. You're welcome.
So happy for you guys.

41:22.855 --> 41:25.149
This was really, really great.
I appreciate it.

41:26.150 --> 41:28.360
-I'll put the bags in the car. Bye.
-Okay.

41:28.444 --> 41:29.403
Bye.

41:30.029 --> 41:32.573
We're leaving for the airport
first thing in the morning,

41:32.656 --> 41:34.325
-so I will call you from Rome.
-Okay.

41:34.408 --> 41:37.828
Okay? Please, please let me know
when you hear from Jack.

41:37.912 --> 41:40.873
-I will. I will.
-Okay. I love you so much.

41:40.956 --> 41:42.082
I love you too, honey.

41:42.708 --> 41:44.919
I have to go
or I'm gonna start bawling again.

41:45.002 --> 41:45.878
Okay.

41:47.129 --> 41:48.839
-Okay.
-Eat lots of pasta for me.

41:48.923 --> 41:49.882
-I will.
-Okay.

41:49.965 --> 41:51.258
-I love you.
-I love you too.

42:06.398 --> 42:07.608
Jack, it's me again.

42:07.691 --> 42:11.070
Can you please just call me back?
I'm really starting to worry about you.

42:39.598 --> 42:42.309
Oh, my God, Preacher. Did you find him?

42:42.393 --> 42:43.519
Not yet.
