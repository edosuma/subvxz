WEBVTT

00:12.875 --> 00:13.834
TERRY:
Is that your boyfriend?

00:13.917 --> 00:15.333
BRIDGET:
I think so.

00:15.417 --> 00:17.333
MARVIN:
Hey, hey, Mr. Donovan.

00:17.417 --> 00:18.792
Hey, you buy me yet?

00:18.875 --> 00:20.250
RAY:
Remember that kid we bought?

00:20.333 --> 00:22.208
His mother must've shot off
her mouth.

00:22.291 --> 00:24.959
You promised me this wouldn't
come back.

00:25.041 --> 00:26.333
You promised me.

00:26.417 --> 00:28.458
EZRA: Sean shot the girl
with your gun,

00:28.542 --> 00:30.375
high on your drugs.

00:30.458 --> 00:31.333
Ray said you were
in trouble anyway--

00:31.417 --> 00:32.959
you'd stolen a lot of money
from Sully.

00:33.041 --> 00:34.917
Sean Walker really killed
that girl, huh?

00:35.000 --> 00:37.333
AVI:
Mickey's met with him

00:37.417 --> 00:40.041
a couple of times
since Palm Springs.

00:40.125 --> 00:42.667
(siren wailing)
You seem a little
under the weather.

00:42.750 --> 00:45.917
Ray? (shouts)
Motherfucker.

00:46.000 --> 00:48.750
If you think he's after you,
he probably is.

00:48.834 --> 00:50.792
RAY: You think you're
the first person that tried

00:50.875 --> 00:52.000
to shut us down, you dumb fuck?

00:52.083 --> 00:54.041
I told you everything.
I told you...

00:54.125 --> 00:55.750
Who the fuck are you, Ray?

00:55.834 --> 00:57.917
NOMI:
Is he a good husband?

00:58.000 --> 00:59.333
How do you mean?
Men are...
they're naturally

00:59.417 --> 01:01.834
really secretive animals.

01:01.917 --> 01:03.000
You never told me
how Bridget died.

01:04.417 --> 01:04.959
RAY:
She was high on drugs.

01:05.041 --> 01:07.792
She jumped off a roof.

01:07.875 --> 01:09.792
BRIDGET:
Daddy, please stop it!

01:09.875 --> 01:11.959
You might've had the balls
to put me away, kid,

01:12.041 --> 01:14.208
but shoot me? I don't think so.

01:44.583 --> 01:47.000
ABBY:
Ray, you up here?

01:48.917 --> 01:51.750
Where you going now?

01:51.834 --> 01:54.083
Boston.

01:54.166 --> 01:56.250
Boston?!

01:56.333 --> 01:58.834
Why the fuck are you going
to Boston?

01:58.917 --> 02:00.250
You pull a gun

02:00.333 --> 02:01.166
on youfather
in front of your children,

02:01.250 --> 02:03.834
and then you pack your shit
and leave?

02:03.917 --> 02:05.667
It's business.
You won't even let me

02:05.750 --> 02:07.125
take the kids home
to see my parents,

02:07.208 --> 02:09.333
and now all of a sudden
you're going back?

02:09.959 --> 02:12.667
Is this about Colleen?

02:12.750 --> 02:14.041
For Christ's sakes,

02:14.125 --> 02:15.917
Abs, she's been dead
for 20 years.

02:16.000 --> 02:17.583
Then why are you going back?

02:17.667 --> 02:21.333
I gotta see someone.

02:21.417 --> 02:23.542
But you won't tell me who?

02:26.834 --> 02:29.208
What the hell is
a Steampunk Wizard of Oz?

02:29.291 --> 02:32.000
It's The Wizard of Oz set in
the world of Victorian England

02:32.083 --> 02:33.333
where everything's, like,

02:33.417 --> 02:35.083
steam-powered and
industrialized.

02:35.166 --> 02:38.000
Sounds stupid. Why are you all
of a sudden into doing musicals?

02:38.083 --> 02:40.041
I thought you hated that shit.

02:46.583 --> 02:49.250
Morning.

03:01.375 --> 03:03.000
(sighs)

03:03.083 --> 03:04.375
So, what are you guys
doing today?

03:07.333 --> 03:08.917
Well, Bridget's auditioning
for this dumb play,

03:09.000 --> 03:11.166
and I've got soccer.

03:11.250 --> 03:13.291
Yeah? Sounds like a good day.

03:15.500 --> 03:17.750
You fuckin' knew?!

03:17.834 --> 03:20.083
You knew my moms was killed
and you ain't tell me?
All right.

03:20.166 --> 03:21.583
All right, all right. Calm down.
Let's go outside.

03:21.667 --> 03:23.333
She was murdered
in our own house.
Ray...

03:23.417 --> 03:25.834
Out. Right now.
Fuck you, man.
You knew.

03:25.917 --> 03:26.917
Daddy!
No, Ray...

03:27.000 --> 03:30.291
No...!
Stay there, Bridget.

03:30.375 --> 03:32.792
ABBY:
Bridget, just... just wait.

03:32.875 --> 03:34.166
ABBY:
Hold on. Ray...
Fuck off me.

03:34.250 --> 03:36.417
Mom, stop.
No!

03:37.834 --> 03:38.417
What the fuck is this?

03:38.500 --> 03:39.542
Bring a gun
in my house?

03:44.542 --> 03:45.083
You should've told me.

03:45.166 --> 03:47.709
Shut up and keep walking.

03:53.709 --> 03:56.667
Fucking crazy, man.
What were you thinking?

03:56.750 --> 04:00.166
(sighs)
Yo. Sorry about that, man.

04:00.250 --> 04:02.792
He got a text from his
little cousin about his mom.

04:02.875 --> 04:05.083
I mean, dead bodies in
the house for days.

04:05.166 --> 04:07.542
That was just nasty.

04:11.500 --> 04:12.417
Yo, you do that?

04:14.583 --> 04:16.667
Are you out
of your fuckin' mind?

04:16.750 --> 04:18.875
(chuckles)
Hey, look, my bad.

04:18.959 --> 04:20.667
I'm just wonderin'.

04:20.750 --> 04:24.000
You keep that kid away
from my daughter, you hear me?

04:25.000 --> 04:27.875
All right.

04:27.959 --> 04:30.000
(clicks tongue)

04:30.083 --> 04:30.375
(sniffs)

04:35.792 --> 04:37.417
Where you going?
To talk to Marvin.

04:37.500 --> 04:39.375
No, you're not.
You can't just order me
to not...

04:39.458 --> 04:41.625
You stay away from him,
you understand me?

04:41.709 --> 04:44.542
(sighs)

04:50.041 --> 04:52.208
You want to explain what the
hell that kid was talking about?

04:52.291 --> 04:54.166
It's nothing.
He's just upset.

04:54.250 --> 04:55.750
He said his
mother was murdered,

04:55.834 --> 04:57.500
said you knew something
about it.

04:57.583 --> 05:00.792
It's got nothing
to do with us, Abs.
Really?

05:00.875 --> 05:02.834
You're scaring me, Ray.

05:02.917 --> 05:04.792
The way you've been.

05:04.875 --> 05:06.375
You're fucking scaring me.

05:06.458 --> 05:09.500
Come on, Abs.
(sighs heavily)

05:15.542 --> 05:17.709
See you in a few days.

05:34.709 --> 05:35.375
MAN:
Hey.

05:35.458 --> 05:38.000
You wanted to see me?
Yes.

05:39.291 --> 05:41.750
Have a seat.
(clears throat)

05:44.834 --> 05:48.166
You did some work
on Ezra Goldman

05:48.250 --> 05:51.166
and Lee Drexler
a couple of years ago.

05:51.250 --> 05:54.750
Yeah. I couldn't get it
to stick.

05:54.834 --> 05:56.083
They're crafty guys.

05:56.166 --> 05:58.667
Wiretapping, extortion,
jury tampering.

05:58.750 --> 06:01.250
Criminal justice terrorists.
I want to bring
some new evidence

06:01.333 --> 06:01.959
to Brady.

06:02.041 --> 06:04.583
See if I can get funded.

06:04.667 --> 06:05.917
Okay. What do you got?

06:06.000 --> 06:07.875
Murder.

06:09.500 --> 06:10.917
Involving Sean Walker.

06:11.000 --> 06:13.041
Sean fucking Walker?

06:14.375 --> 06:16.000
Are you serious?
I have evidence

06:16.083 --> 06:18.709
that he shot a girl in Boston
20 years ago,

06:18.792 --> 06:23.625
and Ezra Goldman and Ray Donovan
covered it up.

06:23.917 --> 06:27.125
Wow.

06:28.417 --> 06:30.041
I'm in.

06:30.917 --> 06:32.083
AVI:
The Fed's been looking for him

06:32.166 --> 06:34.625
for 20 years, Ray.

06:34.709 --> 06:38.291
Do you think you can just fly
to Boston and find him?

06:38.375 --> 06:39.834
Why don't you let me

06:39.917 --> 06:41.333
take care of Mick?

06:41.417 --> 06:43.458
Because I need you on the
outside, not in prison.

06:43.542 --> 06:46.458
You know, rumor is...

06:46.542 --> 06:47.458
he's in Belfast.

06:47.542 --> 06:50.458
Sully didn't go
to fucking Ireland.

06:53.375 --> 06:56.000
He's a ghost, Ray.

06:56.083 --> 06:58.709
You're chasing
a fucking ghost.

06:58.792 --> 07:00.625
Story of my life.

07:00.709 --> 07:03.792
And even if you
do find him, what?

07:03.875 --> 07:06.250
Thanks for the ride.

07:11.917 --> 07:13.750
Be careful out there.

07:13.834 --> 07:15.625
WOMAN (over P.A.):
The white zone is for

07:15.709 --> 07:19.792
the immediate loading and
unloading of passengers only.

You're right about Van.

09:06.709 --> 09:08.625
What's he got?

09:08.709 --> 09:10.208
Says he found a witness

09:10.291 --> 09:12.166
to testify to a cover-up
of a murder.

09:12.250 --> 09:13.500
Says he could

Right there. Consultant.

09:39.917 --> 09:41.750
Black Mass.

09:41.834 --> 09:47.291
This minor masterpiece
of the '90s action oeuvre

09:47.375 --> 09:50.000
laid the groundwork
for such films

09:50.083 --> 09:52.667
as Tarantino's Reservoir Dogs,

09:52.750 --> 09:54.500
Fincher's Seven;
It was also

09:54.583 --> 09:57.542
the film, as we know,
that introduced

09:57.625 --> 10:00.792
the world
to the great talent

10:00.875 --> 10:03.500
of our guest of honor
this evening,

10:03.583 --> 10:06.875
Sean Walker. Oh.
(chuckles)

10:06.959 --> 10:09.041
Hey, Sean!

10:09.125 --> 10:10.208
Sean! Hey, Sean!

10:10.291 --> 10:11.083
Thank you. Thank you.

10:11.166 --> 10:13.208
Thank you.

10:14.166 --> 10:16.291
Thank you.

10:16.375 --> 10:17.792
I'll be right back.

10:17.875 --> 10:19.667
Be right back!
He'll be right back!

10:28.458 --> 10:30.083
(phone rings)

10:31.041 --> 10:32.750
Yeah.

10:32.834 --> 10:34.500
SEAN:
Ray, your father's stalking me.

10:34.583 --> 10:36.375
What?

10:36.458 --> 10:39.083
He's at my screening, screaming
my name from the third row.

10:39.166 --> 10:40.500
You got a bodyguard there?

10:40.583 --> 10:42.250
Bodyguard? What's that gonna do?

10:42.333 --> 10:43.458
Just don't get near him.

10:43.542 --> 10:44.959
You know, I'm sick of this shit!

10:45.041 --> 10:46.041
You keep saying
you're gonna handle this,

10:46.125 --> 10:47.625
and nothing fucking happens!

10:47.709 --> 10:49.083
I am handling. What the hell...?
SEAN:
You know

10:49.166 --> 10:50.125
how many times
you have said that?

10:50.208 --> 10:51.041
He's a harmless old man.

10:51.125 --> 10:52.709
He likes movies.
What can I tell you?

10:52.792 --> 10:53.667
You know what?

10:53.750 --> 10:54.208
You're fucking fired.

10:54.291 --> 10:55.625
Don't do that.

10:55.709 --> 10:58.041
I'm one
of the most important people

10:58.125 --> 11:00.583
on the planet; I can deal
with this on my own, Ray.

11:00.667 --> 11:02.875
Don't get
any stupid ideas, Sean.

11:02.959 --> 11:04.875
You're not a character
in one of your movies.

11:08.709 --> 11:11.375
Asshole.

11:11.458 --> 11:14.083
Are you ready, Sean?

11:17.250 --> 11:20.000
(sniffing)

11:20.083 --> 11:22.500
(applause and whooping)

11:25.583 --> 11:28.041
Sorry about that.
I had to get the mic on.

11:28.125 --> 11:29.917
Reset it.

11:30.000 --> 11:31.291
All right.

11:31.375 --> 11:34.417
All right, uh,
let's start with questions.

11:34.500 --> 11:35.959
Uh, yes.

11:36.041 --> 11:36.583
You in the
glasses, yes.

11:36.667 --> 11:39.417
Thanks.
(clears throat)

11:39.500 --> 11:40.417
Thanks. (clears throat)

11:40.500 --> 11:42.792
Hi. Hi. Uh, my name is Sam.

11:42.875 --> 11:44.917
I'm a very huge fan
of everything you do,

11:45.000 --> 11:47.375
Thank you.
and I love your work so much.

11:47.458 --> 11:49.667
Yeah, yeah, I'm-I'm a great fan,
too. I'm a big fan.
And Black Mass...

11:49.750 --> 11:52.375
And I got an idea
for a movie you should do.

11:53.917 --> 11:54.750
It's about an unknown actor

11:54.834 --> 11:56.959
who comes to Boston
to act in a film,

11:57.041 --> 12:00.375
and he ends up shooting a
young woman in the head.

12:00.458 --> 12:02.291
And then he frames a working Joe

12:02.375 --> 12:04.375
from an honest family
for the murder.

12:04.458 --> 12:06.625
Sounds interesting.

12:06.709 --> 12:07.542
Yeah, I ain't done yet.

12:07.625 --> 12:10.458
You see,
this honest family man--

12:10.542 --> 12:13.625
he goes to jail for 20 years.

12:13.709 --> 12:15.083
And the young actor--

12:15.166 --> 12:17.291
he becomes the biggest
movie star in the world.

12:17.375 --> 12:20.333
What do you think?

12:20.417 --> 12:22.417
It sounds a... a bit...

12:22.500 --> 12:23.625
You want to buy it?

12:23.709 --> 12:25.792
I actually don't buy pitches...

12:25.875 --> 12:26.959
MAN:
Buy it!

12:27.041 --> 12:28.000
Yeah, buy it.

12:28.083 --> 12:29.875
Buy it! Buy it!

12:29.959 --> 12:32.083
CROWD (chanting):
Buy it! Buy it!

12:32.166 --> 12:33.792
Buy it! Buy it!

12:33.875 --> 12:34.250
Buy it! Buy it! Buy it...!

12:34.333 --> 12:36.625
(laughter)

12:36.709 --> 12:37.583
Okay. Okay.
Buy it! Buy it! Buy it!

12:37.667 --> 12:40.542
You're very convincing.

12:40.625 --> 12:42.709
All right.
I'm gonna give you my number.

12:42.792 --> 12:43.667
All right. Sam?

12:43.750 --> 12:46.000
Um, yes, uh,
Black Mass.

12:46.083 --> 12:48.834
Christian undertones,
religious, all that good stuff.

12:48.917 --> 12:51.375
Did you study
with the Catholic Church?

12:51.458 --> 12:53.583
Did you do anything with
the priest... the priesthood?

12:59.208 --> 13:01.834
(sighs)

13:05.083 --> 13:08.166
Hi.

13:08.250 --> 13:09.417
What you want?

13:09.500 --> 13:13.375
About your mom.

13:13.458 --> 13:16.166
I just wanted to tell you
how sorry I am.

13:16.250 --> 13:17.750
It's a terrible thing.

13:17.834 --> 13:19.333
Were you close?

13:19.417 --> 13:22.625
She was my mom.

13:24.333 --> 13:26.834
Look, if you ever need
to talk...

13:27.709 --> 13:30.834
I know you
don't know me

13:30.917 --> 13:34.250
so well, but...
if you need to talk.

13:36.166 --> 13:39.250
I'm here.

13:44.291 --> 13:46.458
She was a drug addict.

13:46.542 --> 13:49.041
Couldn't raise me herself,

13:49.125 --> 13:50.333
so she sold me.

13:50.417 --> 13:53.542
Knowing her,

13:53.625 --> 13:55.583
she probably bragged
about all the cash she got.

13:55.667 --> 13:59.041
Someone killed her for it.

13:59.125 --> 14:02.792
What does my husband have to do
with that?

14:02.875 --> 14:06.750
Ask him yourself.

14:21.041 --> 14:22.500
(footsteps approaching)

14:22.583 --> 14:24.959
Sit down, Eddie.

14:30.333 --> 14:32.125
I don't know
what happened.

14:32.208 --> 14:36.542
I picked Mickey up out of that
lineup, just like I told you.

14:36.625 --> 14:37.750
There's some money
you're after, it's gone.

14:37.834 --> 14:41.250
Give it to my mother.
Surgery.

14:41.333 --> 14:43.417
Macular degeneration.

14:43.500 --> 14:45.959
Relax. I'm here to see Sully.

14:46.041 --> 14:51.125
Sully? Sully died ten
years ago, in Belfast.

14:51.208 --> 14:54.834
Just tell him I'm here.

14:59.291 --> 15:01.417
Hey, Ray.

15:01.500 --> 15:03.458
Remember me?

15:03.542 --> 15:05.125
No.

15:14.041 --> 15:15.542
Yo.

15:15.625 --> 15:17.625
You want to make some music?

15:17.709 --> 15:20.041
You want to order some sushi?

15:22.875 --> 15:25.000
I'll tell you what.
Hit that.

15:25.083 --> 15:27.458
That's gonna make you
feel better.

15:29.875 --> 15:32.375
You know what?

15:32.458 --> 15:33.417
We're gonna
throw you a party tomorrow.

15:33.500 --> 15:34.750
Why?

15:34.834 --> 15:37.125
Celebrate your birthday.

15:37.208 --> 15:38.500
It ain't my birthday tomorrow.

15:38.583 --> 15:39.166
(laughs)

15:39.250 --> 15:41.166
It's your new birthday, son.

15:41.250 --> 15:43.166
You got a whole new life
ahead of you.

15:43.250 --> 15:45.458
So, chin up.

15:45.542 --> 15:48.041
We partying tomorrow.

15:48.125 --> 15:49.625
SPORTS ANNOUNCER: Halfway
through the tenth round now,

15:49.709 --> 15:51.291
both fighters beginning
to show signs of fatigue...

15:51.375 --> 15:53.375
DARYLL:
You know, this kid
can fucking fight.

15:53.458 --> 15:55.333
He's just a puncher.

15:55.417 --> 15:57.291
What are you talking about?
He's a beast.

15:57.375 --> 15:59.542
He ain't no real boxer,
that's for sure.

15:59.625 --> 16:01.333
But you don't know
the difference.

16:01.417 --> 16:02.583
I know the difference.

16:02.667 --> 16:04.333
(phone ringing)

16:04.417 --> 16:06.417
You think because you lifted
weights and played football

16:06.500 --> 16:07.583
in high school,
you some type of tough guy.

16:07.667 --> 16:09.709
Yeah, I'm, I'm learning.

16:09.792 --> 16:11.667
Who is this?

16:11.750 --> 16:15.375
SEAN:
I'm sending a car for you
tomorrow at 11:00.

16:15.458 --> 16:16.625
Who is this?

16:16.709 --> 16:18.041
Sean Walker.

16:18.125 --> 16:22.000
Make it 11:30.
I'm drinking tonight.

16:22.083 --> 16:24.417
Okay, that should work.

16:26.291 --> 16:28.625
Whoa! Whoa!

16:30.875 --> 16:34.208
Christ! I'm sleeping over here!

16:34.291 --> 16:38.375
(mocking tone):
Oh, you're sleeping. Oh.

16:38.458 --> 16:41.333
You got a perfectly fine house.

16:41.417 --> 16:42.750
Why ain't you sleeping
over there?

16:42.834 --> 16:46.125
I don't like it no more.

16:46.208 --> 16:47.792
You don't like it no more.

16:47.875 --> 16:49.166
That's all right;
it's just a house. Here.

16:51.959 --> 16:53.250
(laughs)

16:53.333 --> 16:54.667
Stop it, Pa! No.
Ooh. Oh!

16:54.750 --> 16:57.417
(laughs)
Come on.

16:57.500 --> 16:59.041
Get up.
(groaning)

16:59.125 --> 17:00.750
Join the land
of the living.

17:00.834 --> 17:02.291
(groaning)

17:02.375 --> 17:05.542
Come on.
Let's go.

17:05.625 --> 17:07.709
Boxers ain't
fucking tough guys.

17:07.792 --> 17:10.917
They're fucking
students of the sport.

17:11.000 --> 17:12.959
You don't like me, huh?

17:13.041 --> 17:16.750
Was I hiding that
fact from you?

17:16.834 --> 17:18.291
Hey, Terry.

17:18.375 --> 17:20.417
Where's that pretty lady
you been hanging out with?

17:20.500 --> 17:22.125
I haven't seen her
in a while.

17:22.208 --> 17:24.542
She's busy.

17:24.625 --> 17:25.750
(crowd cheering on TV)

17:25.834 --> 17:27.625
He's a puncher.

17:27.709 --> 17:29.500
(laughs)
Hey.

17:29.583 --> 17:31.792
I'm serious!

17:31.875 --> 17:33.291
(laughs)

17:33.375 --> 17:35.291
(boxing broadcast continues
indistinctly)

17:35.375 --> 17:37.709
(phone ringing)

17:42.709 --> 17:46.709
Hey, sweetheart.

17:46.792 --> 17:48.458
You okay?

17:48.542 --> 17:49.834
What was Marvin talking about,
Daddy? Did-Did you buy him?

17:49.917 --> 17:52.458
It's not like that.

17:52.542 --> 17:54.417
But you knew
his mother was dead.

17:54.500 --> 17:56.542
Yeah.

17:56.625 --> 17:57.875
Why wouldn't you tell him?

17:57.959 --> 17:59.333
Listen, sweetheart,

17:59.417 --> 18:01.625
I was trying to help.

18:01.709 --> 18:04.834
Get him out of the house
full of drug addicts.

18:04.917 --> 18:08.250
So you gave money to his mother
to give him to Re-Kon?

18:08.333 --> 18:10.792
People who live like that
die like that, Bridg.

18:10.875 --> 18:12.917
I did my best
to help his mother, too.

18:13.000 --> 18:15.750
It just didn't work out.

18:15.834 --> 18:17.375
But...

18:17.458 --> 18:20.875
I did my best, Bridg.

18:20.959 --> 18:23.000
Do you want to talk to Mom?

18:23.083 --> 18:26.291
No. I'll talk to her tomorrow.

18:27.709 --> 18:30.959
How was school?

18:31.041 --> 18:32.750
It was fine.

18:32.834 --> 18:35.208
Good night, Daddy.

18:47.917 --> 18:51.083
(phone ringing)

18:53.083 --> 18:55.041
Yeah?

18:55.125 --> 18:56.709
EDDIE:
Flanagan's.

18:56.792 --> 18:58.375
When?

18:58.458 --> 18:59.542
Now.

18:59.625 --> 19:03.458
(sighs)

19:09.166 --> 19:11.542
He's back there.

19:22.667 --> 19:24.542
Hey, Ray.

19:24.625 --> 19:27.500
(grunting)

19:27.583 --> 19:30.417
(grunting)

19:33.709 --> 19:36.917
(grunting)

19:37.000 --> 19:39.166
(grunting)

19:39.250 --> 19:41.792
(grunting)

19:41.875 --> 19:42.583
(Ray groaning)

19:42.667 --> 19:44.625
(gasps)

19:44.709 --> 19:46.250
(grunting)

19:46.333 --> 19:50.667
My fucking nose. Aah.

19:50.750 --> 19:53.458
(grunting)

19:53.542 --> 19:55.041
(men panting)

19:55.125 --> 19:55.583
You remember me now?

19:55.667 --> 19:57.834
No.

19:57.917 --> 20:00.500
(grunting)

20:00.583 --> 20:02.000
That it?

20:02.083 --> 20:03.709
(panting)
We done?

20:03.792 --> 20:07.667
(grunting, gasps)

20:07.750 --> 20:09.917
Get the fuck out of town.

20:10.041 --> 20:11.542
(Ray groans)

20:12.750 --> 20:16.125
(sighs, pants)

20:19.041 --> 20:20.667
(groans)

20:20.750 --> 20:22.291
(coughing)

20:22.375 --> 20:24.000
(sighs)

20:24.083 --> 20:26.792
(laughs)

20:26.875 --> 20:28.917
(groans)

20:29.000 --> 20:31.083
Son of a bitch.

20:34.375 --> 20:36.834
Tell Sully I want to see him.

20:38.917 --> 20:40.875
You're a fucking lunatic, Ray.

20:40.959 --> 20:42.417
I told you
he ain't in Boston.

20:42.500 --> 20:44.125
(panting)

20:44.208 --> 20:46.375
I thought you said he was dead.

20:49.166 --> 20:51.500
(panting)

20:57.750 --> 20:58.834
(drinking)

20:58.917 --> 21:01.750
(exhales)

21:04.750 --> 21:06.125
(long sigh)

21:06.208 --> 21:08.333
(knocking on door)

21:15.125 --> 21:16.792
(groans)

21:34.500 --> 21:35.917
I know what you're thinking.

21:36.000 --> 21:37.792
What am I thinking?
You can only

21:37.875 --> 21:38.959
recognize me if you squint.

21:39.041 --> 21:39.959
What are you talking about?

21:40.041 --> 21:42.625
I'm in a fat suit, huh?

21:42.709 --> 21:45.041
Old Gary... in a fat suit.

21:45.125 --> 21:46.959
Shut the fuck up, Gary.
Come in.

21:47.041 --> 21:48.625
Good to see you, Ray.
How you doing?

21:48.709 --> 21:49.250
You all right?
Yeah.

21:49.333 --> 21:50.834
Come on in.
Thanks.

21:50.917 --> 21:53.083
(whistles)

21:53.166 --> 21:55.417
You want a drink?
Sure.

22:01.166 --> 22:01.667
Ice?

22:01.750 --> 22:03.834
Nah.

22:05.166 --> 22:06.500
I was surprised
to get your call, Ray.

22:06.583 --> 22:10.375
Didn't think you came back
to Boston anymore.

22:11.333 --> 22:13.041
I don't.

22:13.125 --> 22:15.041
What's the occasion?

22:15.125 --> 22:18.000
I just got
a little business.

22:18.083 --> 22:19.875
What's your line
of work now, Ray?

22:19.959 --> 22:21.834
I consult.

22:23.208 --> 22:24.417
Sláinte.

22:24.500 --> 22:27.000
You got a wife
and kids now, huh?

22:27.083 --> 22:28.083
(laughs softly)
Four fuckin'

22:28.166 --> 22:31.083
teenage boys.
Holy shit.

22:31.166 --> 22:33.583
(both laugh)

22:33.667 --> 22:35.542
What's your wife's name again?

22:35.625 --> 22:38.750
Gloria. You don't know her.
Where'd you meet her?

22:38.834 --> 22:40.083
She was a secretary
down at the yard.

22:40.166 --> 22:42.834
She know about Bridget?

22:43.208 --> 22:45.625
Fuck, Ray.

22:49.917 --> 22:52.959
I'm gonna ask you
something, Gar.

22:53.041 --> 22:54.917
Bridget ever talk to you
about my father?

22:55.000 --> 22:58.125
What do you mean?

22:58.208 --> 23:01.000
I don't know, uh...

23:01.083 --> 23:04.041
what kind of dad he was?

23:05.208 --> 23:07.458
I don't fuckin' remember.

23:08.709 --> 23:10.917
So, why do you think she did it?

23:11.000 --> 23:12.542
Come on, Ray.

23:12.625 --> 23:15.625
It was 25 years ago.

23:15.709 --> 23:17.834
No idea, huh?

23:18.792 --> 23:22.625
Look, we were fuckin' high
all the time.

23:24.792 --> 23:26.917
That's why you
wanted to talk?

23:27.000 --> 23:29.625
Fuck, Ray...

23:29.709 --> 23:32.667
I can't look back at it no more.

23:33.375 --> 23:36.000
I mean, the Pats,
the Red Sox.

23:36.083 --> 23:38.583
You want to shoot the shit
about hockey or something?

23:38.667 --> 23:40.959
But Bridget?

23:41.041 --> 23:43.000
That shit ain't got no answer.

23:43.083 --> 23:43.834
Think?

23:43.917 --> 23:47.250
I know.

23:51.041 --> 23:52.750
(big sigh)

23:54.709 --> 23:55.917
(groans)

23:58.750 --> 24:00.291
(Ray exhales)

24:00.375 --> 24:03.709
I'm so fuckin' tired, Gary.

24:09.291 --> 24:11.083
Okay.

24:19.834 --> 24:21.917
You don't have
to do that, Ray.

24:22.000 --> 24:24.125
For the kids.

24:26.291 --> 24:28.959
My boy's never
been to Fenway.

24:29.041 --> 24:31.333
Take yours.

24:31.417 --> 24:33.417
Thanks.

24:33.500 --> 24:34.625
Be safe, all right?

24:37.000 --> 24:39.125
See you, Gar.

24:39.208 --> 24:41.333
Take it easy, Ray.

24:58.208 --> 25:01.417
Fuckin' Boston.

26:02.542 --> 26:03.000
(car door closes)

26:03.083 --> 26:05.959
(door closes)

26:12.959 --> 26:14.166
(drums playing lively beat)

26:14.250 --> 26:17.917
MARVIN:

26:18.000 --> 26:19.250

26:21.375 --> 26:23.250

26:23.333 --> 26:25.166
(singing indistinctly)

(drumbeat continues)

26:29.959 --> 26:30.834
♪ All my seasons,

26:30.917 --> 26:33.041
♪ All my seasons

26:33.125 --> 26:34.250
(turns off music)

26:34.333 --> 26:36.500
You ain't supposed to be here.

26:36.583 --> 26:38.000
I know.

26:38.083 --> 26:39.375
Your dad thinks I'm gonna be

26:39.458 --> 26:40.583
a bad influence on you.

26:40.667 --> 26:43.000
My dad's the bad influence.

26:43.083 --> 26:44.291
(quietly):
Yeah.

26:44.375 --> 26:45.917
Well, you're suddenly
in a good mood.

26:46.917 --> 26:47.667
It's my birthday.

26:47.750 --> 26:49.291
Wait, I thought
you were a Virgo.

26:49.375 --> 26:52.041
Used to be.
(giggles)

26:52.125 --> 26:53.917
Now I got a new life,

26:54.000 --> 26:55.083
and a new birthday.

26:55.166 --> 26:58.000
(chuckles)

26:59.291 --> 27:01.166
Come on, shawty.

27:01.250 --> 27:02.959
We're laying down
some tracks.

27:03.041 --> 27:05.041
Okay, sure.

27:05.125 --> 27:07.458
WOMAN:
You're a beautiful boy.

27:07.542 --> 27:12.375
(quiet, indistinct
conversation)

27:12.458 --> 27:13.750
(speaks quietly)

27:13.834 --> 27:17.542
(quiet, indistinct
conversation continues)

27:23.959 --> 27:26.709
What the fuck
are you doing?

27:27.417 --> 27:30.834
How are you, Mrs. Sullivan?

27:30.917 --> 27:33.000
How's Sully keeping
these days?

27:33.083 --> 27:34.750
Tiny, who's this?

27:34.834 --> 27:37.125
I'm Ray Donovan, ma'am.

27:37.208 --> 27:38.667
Mickey's boy.

27:38.750 --> 27:40.667
Mickey. That prick.

27:40.750 --> 27:42.583
Sleeps with a nigger

27:42.667 --> 27:45.375
while his beautiful
wife was dying.

27:45.458 --> 27:47.000
That's him.

27:47.083 --> 27:50.375
Tell Sully I want to
see him, all right?

27:50.458 --> 27:52.166
Go fuck yourself.

27:53.000 --> 27:56.667
Charming as ever,
Mrs. Sullivan.

27:56.750 --> 27:57.625
Come on.

27:57.709 --> 28:00.041
(grunts in pain)

28:00.125 --> 28:02.083
Ow...

28:02.166 --> 28:05.333
You tell Sully I got
something for him.

28:05.417 --> 28:06.458
You tell him
I'm not leaving

28:06.542 --> 28:10.083
till he talks to me, all right?

28:10.166 --> 28:12.166
(shudders, groans quietly)

28:13.291 --> 28:13.834
(groans)

28:13.917 --> 28:15.917
Take care,
Mrs. Sullivan.

28:16.000 --> 28:18.417
(door rattles open)

28:18.500 --> 28:20.125
(door shuts)

28:20.208 --> 28:22.417
Let's, um...

28:22.500 --> 28:24.542
let's look at
some options.

28:24.625 --> 28:26.375
All right.

28:26.458 --> 28:27.834
(mellow jazz playing)

28:30.083 --> 28:33.083
Oh, my God.

28:33.166 --> 28:34.583
They're so beautiful.

28:34.667 --> 28:35.375
Price range gonna work?

28:35.458 --> 28:38.333
Ooh, I don't know.

28:38.417 --> 28:40.834
Maybe Ray has more
than he lets on?

28:40.917 --> 28:43.625
You think moving is
gonna change anything?

28:43.709 --> 28:45.083
Maybe if we move into town,

28:45.166 --> 28:47.625
he'll get rid
of that weird apartment.

28:47.709 --> 28:48.500
God, that fuckin' place.

28:48.583 --> 28:51.041
(smacks lips)
I decorated it.

28:51.417 --> 28:54.000
I'm sorry.

28:54.083 --> 28:54.542
(laughs)

28:54.625 --> 28:57.250
I found a handcuff.

28:57.333 --> 28:59.625
A handcuff?

28:59.709 --> 29:02.417
Do you think they
torture people there?

29:02.500 --> 29:04.458
You mean people other than us?

29:04.542 --> 29:06.959
(mellow jazz continues)

29:08.500 --> 29:11.208
I'm so lonely
in Calabasas.

29:11.291 --> 29:13.083
Oh, sweetheart,

29:13.166 --> 29:15.208
I've been lonely
20 years.

29:15.291 --> 29:17.458
Everyone's lonely.

29:20.542 --> 29:22.667
In Ray's apartment...

29:22.750 --> 29:27.583
that huge photo
of Marilyn Monroe--

29:27.667 --> 29:29.583
why is that art?

29:29.667 --> 29:31.333
It's about celebrity

29:31.417 --> 29:34.875
and-and deconstructing
the myth of fame.

29:36.375 --> 29:38.333
Oh, God.

29:38.417 --> 29:41.166
I'm so full of shit.

29:41.250 --> 29:44.083
(laughing):
I need another drink.

29:44.166 --> 29:44.875
(laughing):
Me, too. Waiter?

30:00.333 --> 30:02.208
(barking)

30:03.458 --> 30:06.208
(barks)

30:06.291 --> 30:10.166
ABBY: So, Ray went
to Boston yesterday.

30:10.250 --> 30:11.500
So?

30:11.583 --> 30:13.041
He hates it there.

30:13.125 --> 30:14.792
He won't even
let me go back.

30:14.875 --> 30:18.041
I mean, our kids
have never been.

30:18.125 --> 30:20.041
So why do you
think he went?

30:20.125 --> 30:20.500
Something to do with his father.

30:20.583 --> 30:22.709
Oh. You know,

30:22.792 --> 30:25.500
I met him the other day;
he came to the house.

30:25.583 --> 30:27.208
Charming.

30:27.291 --> 30:29.125
Ray hates him.
(groans)

30:29.208 --> 30:30.375
You know he killed
Ray's girlfriend, right?

30:30.458 --> 30:33.000
I heard that.

30:33.083 --> 30:34.625
Ray started fuckin' her
after my parents

30:34.709 --> 30:36.166
made me break up with him.

30:36.250 --> 30:38.000
They were mortified
that I was with a Donovan.

30:38.083 --> 30:39.625
Wouldn't let me
out of the house.

30:39.709 --> 30:40.583
So Ray took up
with this girl Colleen.

30:40.667 --> 30:42.917
And Mickey killed her?

30:43.000 --> 30:45.125
That's why Ray hates him.

30:45.208 --> 30:48.750
Sometimes I think Ray's still
obsessed with that dead girl.

30:48.834 --> 30:50.041
Oh, please!

30:50.125 --> 30:51.333
G-Guess what
Ezra named the dog.

30:51.417 --> 30:53.583
What?

30:53.667 --> 30:54.834
Ruth.

30:54.917 --> 30:57.458
No!
I swear to God.

30:57.542 --> 31:00.333
(both laughing)

31:01.500 --> 31:03.709
It's not even a girl dog.

31:03.792 --> 31:06.375
I know! And for such
a little thing,

31:06.458 --> 31:08.041
it's got a huge dick.

31:08.125 --> 31:10.417
Ruth.

31:10.500 --> 31:11.375
Ruth's got a big dick.

31:11.458 --> 31:13.750
(laughing)

31:28.417 --> 31:30.917
That's a good boy.

31:31.000 --> 31:32.208
Look at you--
mm, mm, mm.

31:48.333 --> 31:51.000
(doors shut)

31:58.083 --> 31:59.834
Raymond.

31:59.917 --> 32:00.834
Sully.

32:00.917 --> 32:04.000
Heard you got
your own family now.

32:04.083 --> 32:06.250
Son. Daughter.

32:08.250 --> 32:09.667
Now, thanks
to your prick father,

32:09.750 --> 32:12.208
I don't got no family left.

32:13.709 --> 32:16.542
He ratted 'em all out.

32:16.625 --> 32:17.583
Yeah. That's what he does.
Yeah.

32:17.667 --> 32:20.041
They all went
to prison.

32:20.125 --> 32:22.291
My son Jamie got stabbed.

32:22.375 --> 32:23.834
My brother Robbie...

32:23.917 --> 32:26.000
got that fucking AIDS.

32:26.083 --> 32:27.667
Yeah, I was sorry
to hear about that.

32:27.750 --> 32:30.291
Well, enough sad stories.

32:30.375 --> 32:33.208
Come on.

32:33.291 --> 32:33.834
Sit down.

32:37.250 --> 32:39.000
What are you doing here?

32:39.083 --> 32:41.458
(grunts, exhales)

32:44.709 --> 32:46.709
I came to see you.

32:46.792 --> 32:49.625
Clearly. You ran through
the fucking gauntlet.

32:49.709 --> 32:53.208
(laughs)
Yeah.

32:53.291 --> 32:55.500
Visited with my mother.

32:55.583 --> 32:57.291
Oh, she's a treasure, Sully.

32:57.375 --> 33:00.291
Don't be a fucking wiseass.

33:01.458 --> 33:04.166
What are you doing here, Ray?

33:06.250 --> 33:09.458
I want you to kill my father.

33:10.417 --> 33:13.709
(laughing)

33:13.792 --> 33:16.792
Fucking Jesus.
(laughs)

33:16.875 --> 33:20.041
(sighs) I thought my family
was fucking screwed up.

33:21.083 --> 33:25.875
You been to a post office
lately, Ray?

33:25.959 --> 33:29.917
I'm the FBI's most wanted.
Still number fucking one.
Yeah, I know.

33:30.000 --> 33:31.625
So, what, you're gonna bring
your fucking father to me

33:31.709 --> 33:32.750
and let me finish the job?

33:32.834 --> 33:35.458
No. I was thinking I'd
bring you out to Los Angeles.

33:35.542 --> 33:37.333
You ever been?

33:40.625 --> 33:41.583
Been anywhere
the last 20 years?

33:41.667 --> 33:43.250
What do you think?

33:43.333 --> 33:46.917
Haven't been to the dentist
in 20 fucking years.

33:47.000 --> 33:47.500
I think you'll like it.

33:47.583 --> 33:50.417
Come over,

33:50.500 --> 33:53.250
get a little sun,
do a little job

33:53.333 --> 33:56.834
and after that you can pick
your next stop.

33:59.417 --> 34:01.458
Keep talking.

34:01.542 --> 34:04.583
I can set you up wherever
you want to go.

34:04.667 --> 34:06.750
Dubai, Maldives...
(scoffs)

34:06.834 --> 34:08.709
Vietnam-- none
of those places extradite.

34:08.792 --> 34:09.625
I ain't going to fucking Dubai

34:09.709 --> 34:10.625
to sit around with a bunch
of towelheads.

34:10.709 --> 34:12.917
Okay, fuck Dubai.

34:13.000 --> 34:14.417
No, 'cause where I want
to fucking go

34:14.500 --> 34:16.917
is not gonna be cheap.

34:18.792 --> 34:20.875
All right.

34:24.000 --> 34:26.458
Why don't you do it yourself?

34:27.625 --> 34:29.542
I would if I could.

34:30.917 --> 34:33.291
(sighs)

34:36.583 --> 34:38.667
Why me, Raymond?

34:41.333 --> 34:43.458
I guess 'cause I want
the last person he sees

34:43.542 --> 34:44.500
to hate him as much I do.

34:44.583 --> 34:47.375
(door opens)

34:47.458 --> 34:50.333
WOMAN:
Will you come out here
and walk the dog?

34:50.417 --> 34:53.208
I can't get him to make.
He'll only make with you.

35:00.542 --> 35:03.000
I'll be in touch.

35:03.083 --> 35:04.625
(grunts)

35:09.417 --> 35:11.125
Pay your respects

35:11.208 --> 35:13.000
to that dead girl.

35:13.083 --> 35:15.917
She was your fucking girlfriend.

35:16.917 --> 35:19.041
Yeah.

35:25.125 --> 35:28.417
(door shuts)
MICKEY:
Too fucking bad

35:28.500 --> 35:30.083
about Rock Hudson.

35:30.166 --> 35:31.375
SEAN:
What?

35:31.458 --> 35:32.750
Made some good movies.

35:32.834 --> 35:34.500
Pillow Talk,
fucking great.

35:34.583 --> 35:37.709
But that Doris Day did not
do it for me.

35:37.792 --> 35:41.250
Should've been Lena Horne
in Doris Day's part.

35:41.333 --> 35:44.625
Or Eartha Kitt. Whoo...

35:44.709 --> 35:46.250
Who?

35:46.333 --> 35:47.750
What's the matter with you?

35:47.834 --> 35:48.667
You don't know
who Eartha Kitt is?

35:48.750 --> 35:50.583
No. Hey.
MAN:
Hey, Sean, how you doing?

35:50.667 --> 35:52.000
Let's have lunch!

35:52.083 --> 35:53.750
(quietly): That guy is such
a fucking cocksucker.

35:53.834 --> 35:56.291
Now, Mickey...

35:56.375 --> 35:58.709
listen.

35:58.792 --> 36:00.041
You got to understand
something.

36:00.125 --> 36:04.166
If I buy this story, I own it.

36:04.250 --> 36:06.500
It's an exclusive deal.

36:06.583 --> 36:09.917
You cannot share
this with anyone.

36:10.000 --> 36:12.000
I got it.

36:12.083 --> 36:13.875
But I think you've got more
than one movie in you.

36:13.959 --> 36:17.041
You better believe it.
(girls screaming)

36:17.125 --> 36:20.500
BODYGUARD:
Ladies, please, step back.
Oh, no, Curtis, it's all right.

36:20.583 --> 36:22.166
They're just little girls.
It's... Oh...

36:22.250 --> 36:23.834
(phone ringing)
Just over here, girls.

36:23.917 --> 36:25.500
Right here.

36:27.583 --> 36:28.917
What is it?

36:29.000 --> 36:30.709
I've got a job for you.

36:30.792 --> 36:32.583
What now?

36:32.667 --> 36:33.625
I need you to come in.

36:33.709 --> 36:35.041
Sure, sure. I'm on my way.

36:35.125 --> 36:37.500
Be there soon.

36:37.583 --> 36:41.959
(girls speaking Japanese)

36:42.041 --> 36:44.667
Okay. All right. Bye-bye.

36:44.750 --> 36:47.625
Arigato.

36:47.709 --> 36:49.750
(speaks Japanese)

36:49.834 --> 36:52.125
(laughs)
(chuckles)

36:52.208 --> 36:53.709
So...

36:53.792 --> 36:56.667
thinking this deal, we should
make it an overall deal.

36:56.750 --> 36:58.125
What do you think?

36:58.208 --> 36:59.792
Sounds good.

36:59.875 --> 37:02.500
Sounds real good.

37:02.583 --> 37:05.375
BRIDGET:

37:41.083 --> 37:44.291
(laughs)
That's cool.

37:49.875 --> 37:54.166
You know, Ray actually likes
nice things, nice clothes.

37:54.250 --> 37:57.083
Where we're from, men aren't
supposed to dress like that.

37:57.166 --> 37:59.458
I think it's sexy.

37:59.542 --> 38:00.834
Excuse me.

38:00.917 --> 38:02.583
Fucking Ray.

38:02.667 --> 38:03.667
(laughs)

38:03.750 --> 38:05.333
I hate him all day,

38:05.417 --> 38:07.500
and when I get drunk, all
I do is think about him.

38:07.583 --> 38:10.542
Hmm. Thank you.

38:11.917 --> 38:15.417
That's $5,000.

38:15.500 --> 38:17.375
Doesn't Ray buy you things?

38:17.458 --> 38:19.834
Yeah, but it's never
the right thing.

38:19.917 --> 38:22.917
Hmm.

38:23.000 --> 38:23.917
Oh, just buy them.

38:24.000 --> 38:26.709
They look great on you.

38:26.792 --> 38:28.792
No.

38:28.875 --> 38:30.458
Come on.

38:30.542 --> 38:34.041
I used to do this
all the time when I was a kid.

38:34.125 --> 38:35.542
Abby...

38:35.625 --> 38:38.500
What the fuck?

38:42.750 --> 38:44.792
Ma'am?

38:44.875 --> 38:48.625
Go! Go! Go!

38:48.709 --> 38:49.709
Shit!
What are you doing?

38:49.792 --> 38:52.208
(screams)

38:52.291 --> 38:53.500
Are you out of your mind?

38:53.583 --> 38:54.000
SALESMAN:
Ladies, get back here!

38:54.083 --> 38:56.250
Oh, my God, hurry!

38:56.333 --> 38:57.917
Hey!
Shit! Fuck! Come on.

38:58.000 --> 38:59.417
Oh!

38:59.500 --> 39:02.125
Oh, shit!
My Manolos.
Get the fuck up!

39:02.208 --> 39:03.583
They're Manolos.
Give me your fuckin' hand.

39:03.667 --> 39:05.500
(laughing)

39:05.583 --> 39:07.333
Come on!
You gotta get the fuck up!
(laughing): I can't.

39:07.417 --> 39:09.917
I can't... wait a minute...
I think I'm gonna pee my pants.

39:10.000 --> 39:13.083
(laughter)

39:13.166 --> 39:14.917
Oh, my God.

39:15.000 --> 39:15.834
I'm peeing.

39:15.917 --> 39:19.000
(laughing loudly)

39:24.834 --> 39:27.583
Hey, Van, listen,
before we take this upstairs,

39:27.667 --> 39:29.750
I think we should
go over your files.

39:29.834 --> 39:30.291
You know, maybe let me
take home what you got

39:30.375 --> 39:32.375
so I can get familiar?

39:32.458 --> 39:33.750
I'd rather keep them in my safe.

39:33.834 --> 39:36.041
All right, then,
at least give me the tapes.

39:36.125 --> 39:37.583
I'd rather not.

39:37.667 --> 39:39.041
Van, if you can't

39:39.125 --> 39:40.792
trust me with your evidence,
how can I help you?

39:43.208 --> 39:44.667
Who are you working for, Frank?
What?!

39:44.750 --> 39:47.583
Who...

39:47.667 --> 39:50.041
are you working for, Frank?

39:50.125 --> 39:53.458
The FBI, Van.

39:53.542 --> 39:55.333
Does Donovan have something
on you?

39:55.417 --> 39:57.083
You know, that sounds
a little paranoid.

39:57.166 --> 39:57.709
I'm not paranoid.

39:57.792 --> 40:00.625
Really?

40:00.709 --> 40:02.792
Saw you downstairs
the other day.

40:02.875 --> 40:05.500
You were acting really strange.

40:05.583 --> 40:06.709
I'm on antihistamines.

40:06.792 --> 40:09.959
Uh-huh.

40:10.041 --> 40:13.417
All right, you don't want
my help, you go it alone.

40:14.959 --> 40:17.417
Just trying to lend a hand.

40:18.667 --> 40:20.250
I have allergies!

40:30.959 --> 40:32.250
Damn, you sing good as shit!

40:32.333 --> 40:34.500
For a white girl!

40:34.583 --> 40:36.333
Really?
Hell, yeah.

40:36.417 --> 40:38.166
White girl?
(laughing):
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

40:38.250 --> 40:40.542
(laughs)
Shit.

40:43.834 --> 40:45.792
(sighs)

40:45.875 --> 40:47.792
You're so incredible.

40:47.875 --> 40:49.000
So... talented.

40:49.083 --> 40:52.458
I love you.

40:56.792 --> 40:58.917
Sit down, Bridg.

40:59.000 --> 41:00.583
Come on.

41:23.625 --> 41:25.959
(Bridget laughs)

41:28.166 --> 41:32.625
Hey? Where you been, Mickey?

41:32.709 --> 41:35.792
I had a little
business thing.
What business?

41:35.875 --> 41:38.041
My business.
Look, fun and games are over.

41:38.125 --> 41:39.917
I'm wiring you up,
you're gonna get in there

41:40.000 --> 41:41.500
and get a confession
out of Sean Walker.

41:41.583 --> 41:44.417
How am I gonna get close
to a guy like that?

41:44.500 --> 41:45.834
I have faith in you.

41:45.917 --> 41:46.750
Gonna need a lot more money.

41:46.834 --> 41:50.208
I'm tired of these
conversations, Mickey.

41:50.291 --> 41:52.083
You owe me more
than what you've given.

41:52.166 --> 41:53.959
Money isn't a part
of this anymore.

41:54.041 --> 41:57.250
Now, you're get that confession,
or you're going back to Walpole.

42:00.834 --> 42:03.208
(indistinct chatter)

42:05.583 --> 42:08.375
Clear the gym.
Clear the gym!

42:08.458 --> 42:10.583
We're closing early.

42:10.667 --> 42:13.041
We're closing early.
Hey, Ter.

42:13.125 --> 42:14.834
I'm working, Mick.

42:14.917 --> 42:16.500
Hey, get dressed.

42:16.583 --> 42:18.542
Take the jock clothes off.
You, too. You, too.

42:18.625 --> 42:20.375
We're all going out
to celebrate.

42:20.458 --> 42:21.834
What are we celebrating?

42:23.500 --> 42:25.166
I'm back in the movie business.

42:25.250 --> 42:28.500
Hoo-hoo, hoo... hoo-hoo!

42:28.583 --> 42:29.959
I'm back.

42:30.041 --> 42:31.625
(laughing):
I'm back.

42:31.709 --> 42:34.166
Choo-choo, choo-choo,
choo-choo, choo-choo-choo.

42:34.250 --> 42:36.333
Off the tracks.
They can't stop me now.

42:36.417 --> 42:37.875
Choo-choo, choo-choo,
choo-choo, choo-choo.

42:37.959 --> 42:39.667
Whoo-whoo!
Here he comes!

42:49.000 --> 42:50.250
(phone line ringing)

42:50.333 --> 42:51.709
(sighs)

42:51.792 --> 42:52.417
SEAN:
Hello?

42:52.500 --> 42:54.625
Did you talk to my father?

42:54.709 --> 42:56.625
I don't have
to answer to you, Ray.

42:56.709 --> 42:58.542
Did you talk to him?
SEAN:
No, Ray.

42:58.625 --> 43:01.208
I didn't.

43:03.542 --> 43:04.792
Ray? You there?

43:04.875 --> 43:06.500
You're fucking lying
to me, Sean.

43:06.583 --> 43:07.083
Ray, listen.

43:07.166 --> 43:09.709
Have it your way.

43:09.792 --> 43:10.250
You're digging your own grave.

43:10.333 --> 43:12.333
(phone beeps off)

43:16.834 --> 43:18.709
(phone ringing)

43:21.000 --> 43:22.542
Yeah.

43:22.625 --> 43:25.000
FRANK:
Van Miller's off
the reservation.

43:25.083 --> 43:27.625
There's nothing
I can do about him now.

43:29.291 --> 43:31.208
Please, Ray,
cut me some slack.

43:31.291 --> 43:33.166
I swear
I did everything I could.

43:33.250 --> 43:34.250
All right.

43:34.333 --> 43:36.333
Wait in your office.

43:36.417 --> 43:38.875
I'm sending something over now.

44:27.375 --> 44:30.792
(unbuckling belt, sighing)

44:34.208 --> 44:37.583
(sighs deeply)

44:40.291 --> 44:42.291
(sighs)

44:42.375 --> 44:44.542
I'm sorry, Marvin.

44:44.625 --> 44:46.917
I'm not ready.

44:47.000 --> 44:47.875
My moms got murdered

44:47.959 --> 44:51.041
'cause the money
your dad gave her to buy me.

44:51.125 --> 44:53.625
Come on, come on.
Marvin? Marvin?

44:53.709 --> 44:54.917
I can't.

44:55.000 --> 44:56.000
Pipe me, bitch!

44:56.083 --> 44:57.458
Marvin...
Pipe me!

44:57.542 --> 44:59.333
Marvin, I'm sorr... I...

44:59.417 --> 45:00.834
Come on!
Marvin!

45:00.917 --> 45:02.250
Do it!
You asshole!

45:03.417 --> 45:05.542
(crying)

45:10.250 --> 45:14.875
I got to make decisions
sometimes, too.

45:14.959 --> 45:18.000
Okay.

45:18.083 --> 45:21.125
It's not just you doing
what you want all the time.

45:24.041 --> 45:25.625
You hear me?

45:25.709 --> 45:27.667
Ray?

45:31.291 --> 45:32.917
Let me see those shoes again.

45:36.709 --> 45:40.375
(both laughing)

45:40.458 --> 45:43.000
Are you fucking
kidding me?

45:43.083 --> 45:44.959
(laughs)

45:45.041 --> 45:48.083
Including the fine, those are
gonna cost me about $6,000.

45:48.166 --> 45:50.750
Good.

45:51.875 --> 45:53.250
They'll be worth it.

45:53.333 --> 45:58.333
You still drunk?

45:58.417 --> 46:00.875
I don't know.

46:00.959 --> 46:03.208
Maybe.

46:03.291 --> 46:04.875
Good.

46:17.166 --> 46:19.458
(sighs)

46:22.333 --> 46:25.625
(sighs)

46:28.625 --> 46:32.333
Now, touch your nose.

46:32.417 --> 46:36.709
Woop, woop...

46:37.542 --> 46:41.041
That's... that's right.

46:41.125 --> 46:43.208
All right, put your arm down.

46:43.291 --> 46:46.542
That's good.
Now, I need, arms... both...

46:46.625 --> 46:48.083
Arms down.
Raise your right leg.

46:48.166 --> 46:51.208
Straight...
Sir, turn and face me.

46:51.291 --> 46:52.875
(chuckles)

46:52.959 --> 46:53.083
(door opens)

46:59.709 --> 47:02.875
I've been so bad tonight.

47:02.959 --> 47:04.959
Oh, yeah? You think so?

47:05.041 --> 47:07.041
I know so.

47:07.125 --> 47:10.041
And I'm not sorry
about it either.

47:10.125 --> 47:13.709
You're not, huh?
No.

47:13.792 --> 47:16.208
(speaks indistinctly)

47:22.250 --> 47:23.583
(grunts in pain)
What is it?

47:23.667 --> 47:26.208
(groans, hisses)
Huh?

47:29.917 --> 47:32.125
Broken rib, I think.
Ray...

47:32.208 --> 47:34.583
Don't worry about it.

47:41.583 --> 47:43.542
(whispers):
Let me put something on it.

47:43.625 --> 47:45.959
Okay.

47:49.166 --> 47:50.917
(Abby runs upstairs)

48:11.375 --> 48:14.458
(grunts)

48:14.542 --> 48:16.166
(sighs)

48:21.041 --> 48:23.000
How's it going, kiddo?

48:23.083 --> 48:24.792
Good.

48:25.709 --> 48:28.417
Where's your sister?

48:28.500 --> 48:31.125
She's upstairs.
Something's wrong with her.

48:31.208 --> 48:32.834
What do you mean?

48:32.917 --> 48:33.458
She came home from Marvin's
house all screwed up.

48:33.542 --> 48:36.959
Something happened.

48:38.750 --> 48:40.000
(sniffles)

48:40.083 --> 48:41.333
What happened?

48:41.417 --> 48:41.875
It was nothing.

48:41.959 --> 48:43.500
What did he do to you?

48:43.583 --> 48:44.959
He attacked her, Ray.

48:45.041 --> 48:47.375
It was my fault.
He didn't mean it.

48:47.458 --> 48:48.333
What did he do?

48:48.417 --> 48:49.542
He just got carried away.

48:53.041 --> 48:54.875
Don't hurt him.

48:54.959 --> 48:57.667
It's your fault.
You lied to him.

48:57.750 --> 49:00.875
You're a liar, and you don't
help people-- you hurt people.

49:00.959 --> 49:03.208
I hate you!

49:05.291 --> 49:08.083
What is he gonna do, Mom?

49:08.166 --> 49:11.208
(crying)

49:22.959 --> 49:25.333
Yo, I'm sorry.

49:25.417 --> 49:27.625
(grunts)
I'm sorry.

49:27.709 --> 49:30.083
I didn't mean it.

49:37.583 --> 49:40.000
He's gonna kill him.

49:43.208 --> 49:45.583
Mom.

49:45.667 --> 49:47.542
Come away from the window.

49:47.625 --> 49:50.333
(crying):
Mama...

49:50.417 --> 49:52.709
Come away.

49:53.625 --> 49:56.375
(sniffling)

49:56.458 --> 50:00.041
(car door opens, shuts)

50:00.125 --> 50:03.792
(engine starts, car speeds away)

50:09.917 --> 50:13.333
I'm leaving, Mother.

50:13.417 --> 50:16.500
I know, Patrick.

50:20.834 --> 50:23.250
(sighs softly)

50:26.875 --> 50:31.625
(sighs)
Where you taking me?

50:37.959 --> 50:41.542
I didn't mean to hurt her,
Mr. Donovan; I swear.

50:43.542 --> 50:45.709
I didn't mean to hurt her.

50:49.375 --> 50:51.458
Today's my birthday,
Mr. Donovan.

50:58.000 --> 51:00.333
Please.

51:02.000 --> 51:04.375
It's my new birthday.
