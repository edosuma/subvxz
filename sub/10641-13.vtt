  which one of -- of my artists 

01:32.060 --> 01:34.460
     Can handle the pressure    
       of live television.      

01:34.462 --> 01:37.730
 Team blake is a force as usual.

02:16.604 --> 02:18.637
     Paxton, what's so great    
        about what you do       

02:18.639 --> 02:20.239
        Is that even when       
       you're not singing,      

02:20.241 --> 02:22.842
    You're performing in a way  
        that's so natural.      

02:22.844 --> 02:25.144
     Paxton, congratulations.   
      You're gonna move on.

        valuable coaching       

02:28.950 --> 02:30.916
  From key adviser miley cyrus. 

02:30.918 --> 02:32.218
       Miley: I even think      
    you can go bigger, like...  

02:32.220 --> 02:34.053
      ¶ shows that we ain't     
         gonna stand it ¶

       Man. So much talent      
       in that little guy.      

02:47.435 --> 02:49.135
    I mean, he's electrifying   

02:49.137 --> 02:51.203
   When he has that microphone  
           in his hand.         

02:51.205 --> 02:53.105
            [ laughs ]

           I'm excited!         

02:55.176 --> 02:57.243
   Daly: Although blake's team  
         was already full       

02:57.245 --> 03:00.279
  When 23-year-old katie basden 
      hit "the voice" stage,    

03:00.281 --> 03:01.347
     He kept his eye on her.    

03:01.349 --> 03:04.783
   ¶ not gonna let them catch ¶ 

03:04.785 --> 03:07.286
      ¶ the midnight rider ¶

              You sound amazing,
                  by the way.   
       Thank you so much.       

03:12.360 --> 03:14.260
     When somebody's country    
     and they're that great,    

03:14.262 --> 03:17.563
 To helplessly watch that artist
 go to another team, it's tough.

03:17.565 --> 03:19.665
 ¶ maybe i'm a man ¶            

03:19.667 --> 03:22.034

        in the battles.         

03:22.036 --> 03:24.403
      ¶ who could ever help me ¶

03:24.405 --> 03:26.071
    The winner of this battle   
             is ryan.           

03:26.073 --> 03:27.773
      Ryan's gonna move on.     

03:27.775 --> 03:31.010
  Luckily, adam was slow enough 
          to let her go.        

03:31.012 --> 03:32.611
    [ screaming ]

   In the knockout rehearsals,  

03:47.562 --> 03:49.395
    Katie proved to her coach,  
              blake,            

03:49.397 --> 03:51.730
            And miley           
    that she is here to stay.   

03:51.732 --> 03:53.799
    I like this, like, version  
  that you're doing of your own.

03:53.801 --> 03:54.600

It takes me back to             

04:00.575 --> 04:02.241
The '90s and --                 
and country music,

04:06.447 --> 04:08.847
         At country radio       
   and definitely on this show. 

04:08.849 --> 04:11.784

  has the potential to go deep.

05:30.231 --> 05:31.463
              Ooh!              
          [ laughter ]          

05:31.465 --> 05:32.798
I have a different kind of,     

05:32.800 --> 05:34.366
 Like, platonic crush           
   on you, i guess?             

05:34.368 --> 05:35.501
           [ laughter ]         

05:35.503 --> 05:37.536
              Blake:            
   He's combined country music  

05:37.538 --> 05:41.573
        With this soulful       
   r&b/delta blues combination. 

05:41.575 --> 05:43.609
  People like that are the ones 
      that you don't forget,    

05:43.611 --> 05:46.011
      And those are the ones    
  who are a threat on this show.

05:46.013 --> 05:47.513
   Thanks, brother.             
           Congratulations, man.

05:47.515 --> 05:48.814
          Gonna be a lot of fun,
                 brother.

    the rest of blake's team.

         to take my man ¶

  we'll see who pharrell, adam, 

06:00.528 --> 06:02.695
     And christina are taking   
      to the live playoffs.     

06:02.697 --> 06:04.530
                    Whoo!       

06:04.532 --> 06:05.831
         And stick around       

06:05.833 --> 06:07.900
    For some never-before-seen  
     footage of our coaches.    

06:07.902 --> 06:09.902
     This heart thing right here
      is, like, i just can't... 

06:09.904 --> 06:11.537
    It's amazing.               
I, like, want to touch it,      

06:11.539 --> 06:13.038
   But i don't want             
 to be inappropriate.           

06:13.040 --> 06:14.606
          Yeah, i feel like     
     it's inappropriate if i do.

06:14.608 --> 06:15.541
 [ laughs ]                     
         i'm not gonna touch it.

06:18.845 --> 06:20.913
     ¶ this is "the voice" ¶    

06:20.915 --> 06:23.582
      Daly: Welcome back to     
   the road to the live shows.  

06:23.584 --> 06:27.019
       Let's meet the rest      
          of team blake.        

06:27.021 --> 06:30.456
  Next is 20-year-old mary sarah
      from richmond, texas.     

06:30.458 --> 06:32.658
  Mary: I'm working at boot barn
            part-time.          

06:32.660 --> 06:34.226
 When i think about "the voice,"

06:34.228 --> 06:37.796
  The wisdom from these coaches 
    can take me to that level.  

06:37.798 --> 06:43.369
      ¶ where the boys are ¶    

06:43.371 --> 06:48.974
        ¶ someone waits ¶       

06:48.976 --> 06:56.582

06:56.584 --> 06:59.518
     [ cheers and applause ]    

06:59.520 --> 07:03.255
         You actually sound like
         you came from that era.

07:03.257 --> 07:05.491
        And it's gonna be       
  so refreshing to hear somebody

07:05.493 --> 07:09.461
       Bring that era of music  
      back to a stage like this.

07:09.463 --> 07:11.063
      I pick blake shelton.     

07:11.065 --> 07:12.531
     [ cheers and applause ]    

07:12.533 --> 07:14.199
    Daly: During the battles,   
       mary sarah impressed     

07:14.201 --> 07:16.435
     Both coach blake shelton   
    and adviser gwen stefani.   

07:16.437 --> 07:18.470
¶ gotta have your loving        
 just one more time ¶           

07:18.472 --> 07:22.541
Mary, you have a real style to  
your voice and so much dynamics.

07:22.543 --> 07:24.176
            She's vintage       
      but still current somehow.

07:24.178 --> 07:25.310
        -It's weird. Yeah.      
           -It's crazy.         

07:25.312 --> 07:26.945
   There's kind of              
a little bit of everything.     

07:26.947 --> 07:29.415
   Mary sarah is gonna move on  
     to the knockout rounds,    

07:29.417 --> 07:30.783
     Representing team blake.   

07:30.785 --> 07:32.484
         Congratulations.       

07:32.486 --> 07:34.686
 Daly: Mary sarah rolled through
          the knockouts,        

07:34.688 --> 07:37.089
          Earning a spot        
      in the live playoffs.     

07:37.091 --> 07:39.825
        ¶ women like you,       
     they're a dime a dozen ¶   

07:39.827 --> 07:42.728
   ¶ you can buy 'em anywhere ¶ 

07:42.730 --> 07:46.165
        Blake: Mary sarah,      
    she's country to the core.  

07:46.167 --> 07:49.234
  She is definitely somebody who
  has a shot to win this thing. 

07:49.236 --> 07:52.337
      ¶ well, i don't know      
     where that leaves you ¶    
  and even more exciting to me, 
   somebody who has a shot...   

07:52.339 --> 07:55.274
        ¶ oh, but i know        
         where i stand ¶        
  ...To go on to be a big star  
        in country music.

    ¶ a ain't woman enough      
    to take my man ¶            

08:01.849 --> 08:03.816
     Daly: Blake's final artist,
     joe maye,                  

08:03.818 --> 08:07.019
  Returned to "the voice" after 
  failing to get a button pushed

08:07.021 --> 08:09.087
        During his season 9     
        blind audition.         

08:09.089 --> 08:11.857
        ¶ you, you, you ¶       

08:11.859 --> 08:13.826
   Daly: Joe turned two chairs  
            this time           

08:13.828 --> 08:15.961
      And inspired christina    
        to sing with him.       

08:15.963 --> 08:18.330
         ¶ ly-y-y-y-ing ¶

       ¶ i love you, too ¶      

08:25.239 --> 08:27.439
              Blake:            
 When it comes to sales pitches,

08:27.441 --> 08:30.275
       It's hard to compete     
     with christina aguilera    

08:30.277 --> 08:32.811
      After she gets onstage    
      and performs with you.    

08:32.813 --> 08:34.712
       [ audience chanting      
          "christina" ]         

08:34.715 --> 08:36.482
              Daly:             
    After winning his battle,   

08:36.484 --> 08:39.083
   Joe laid it all on the line  
        in the knockouts.       

08:39.086 --> 08:43.255
     ¶ you're wo-o-o-o-rth ¶    

08:43.256 --> 08:45.224
           ¶ oh, yeah ¶         

08:45.226 --> 08:47.459
              For me, joe,      
        you were the revelation.

08:47.461 --> 08:51.196
    Daly: But lost to kata hay  
  and became available to steal.

08:51.198 --> 08:52.231
                 Give me joe.   

08:52.233 --> 08:54.132
         We got a steal!        
           [ screams ]          

08:54.134 --> 08:55.167
     Oh, my god.                

08:55.169 --> 08:57.336
        Blake: Every time       
     he's been on that stage,   

08:57.338 --> 08:58.804
    He's a little bit better.   

08:58.806 --> 09:00.005
       From the first time      
          he auditioned         

09:00.007 --> 09:01.440
    And didn't make it to now,  

09:01.442 --> 09:04.042
   Having a chance to work with 
  christina for a little while, 

09:04.044 --> 09:05.777
      You can definitely see    
         the improvement,       

09:05.779 --> 09:07.713
     And i think you're gonna   
       continue to see it.      

09:07.715 --> 09:09.381
      I got joe!                

09:09.383 --> 09:12.484
   Daly: These are the artists  
     representing team blake    

09:12.486 --> 09:14.019
      In the live playoffs.     

09:14.021 --> 09:16.588
       Couldn't be happier      
   with how my team turned out. 

09:16.590 --> 09:18.891
    I'm extra excited to have   
      all this diversity...     

09:18.893 --> 09:20.192
                   That's right!
       ...And to get into       
         the rehearsals         

09:20.194 --> 09:22.928
   And be able to work with     
   all different kinds of music.

09:22.930 --> 09:25.697
And i'm dying to see which one  
of the artists i have on my team

09:25.699 --> 09:27.933
       Are gonna show themselves
       to be the strong ones.   

09:27.935 --> 09:29.768
     [ cheers and applause ]    

09:29.770 --> 09:31.003
              Yeah!             

09:31.005 --> 09:33.071
              Daly:             
      Next is team pharrell.    

09:33.073 --> 09:35.440
    Let's look at his artists.  

09:35.442 --> 09:39.011
  My only strategy was to try   
and just keep the absolute best.

09:39.013 --> 09:41.747
    And that just so happened   
           to be women.         

09:41.749 --> 09:45.083
     Girl power. Women power.   
           Lady power.          

09:45.085 --> 09:47.219
   Tell me if there's anything  
            i can say,          

09:47.221 --> 09:49.688
 'cause i see your eyes light up
   when pharrell talks to you.  

09:49.690 --> 09:51.089
      I'm a little bit sad.     

09:51.091 --> 09:54.226
      Pharrell ended up with    
        an all-girl squad.      

09:54.228 --> 09:57.396
 Each one of them have their own
  different flavors and styles, 

09:57.398 --> 09:59.598
  So it'll be interesting to see
     where they go from here.   

09:59.600 --> 10:02.167
 Daly: Let's look at the journey
      these five women took     

10:02.169 --> 10:04.202
   To reach the live playoffs.  

10:04.204 --> 10:05.637

   ¶ you're happy without me ¶  
 daly: Her unique voice prompted

10:15.282 --> 10:18.250
 The first four-chair turn      
 of the season.                 

10:18.252 --> 10:19.851
        [ voice breaking ]      
           oh, my god.          

10:19.853 --> 10:22.955
   That intensity that you have 
  that made us all turn around, 

10:22.957 --> 10:24.656
       That is what i want      
         to stand behind.       

10:24.658 --> 10:25.624
         I pick pharrell.

    Daly: During the battles,   
    caity got some tough love   

10:32.099 --> 10:33.999
From adviser sean "diddy" combs.

10:34.001 --> 10:36.501
       Caity, you're better than
   that performance right there.
Mm-hmm.                         

10:36.503 --> 10:40.706
You have to just let yourself go
         with this song         

10:40.708 --> 10:43.542
         And not be afraid to be
               too committed.   
  Yeah.                         

10:43.544 --> 10:45.711

10:56.690 --> 10:58.256
 And in the knockout rehearsals,

10:58.258 --> 11:02.361
    Key adviser miley cyrus     
gave caity a vote of confidence.

                           Okay.

11:03.897 --> 11:05.130
            Keeping it up, yeah.
'cause it just makes it         
a little bit more epic,         

11:05.132 --> 11:07.065
'cause it's such a nice,

11:08.569 --> 11:10.636
 She was kind of my first person

11:10.638 --> 11:14.006

         Hannah right now       
     is a preschool teacher,    

13:35.382 --> 13:37.382

13:37.384 --> 13:40.152
    And not being, like, this

     And i really wanted her    
        to be on my team,       

17:09.061 --> 17:11.663
    Because i feel like i know  
    how to nurture different.   

17:11.665 --> 17:13.064
              Daly:             
    After winning her battle,   

17:13.066 --> 17:15.467
        Emily went back to      
   her singer/songwriter roots  

17:15.469 --> 17:18.603
         In the knockouts       
  with a joni mitchell classic. 

17:18.605 --> 17:20.637
  ¶ don't it always seem to go ¶

17:20.640 --> 17:23.508
    ¶ that you don't know what  
   you've got till it's gone ¶  

17:23.510 --> 17:26.211
      Emily is super unique     
           and gifted.          

17:26.213 --> 17:28.445
     She's made a wise choice   
         with this song.        

17:28.448 --> 17:30.915
       It really shows you      
 that she's a singer/songwriter.

17:30.917 --> 17:32.317
          [ high pitch ]

17:34.721 --> 17:36.788

           That's the best part.
 [ laughs ]                     

17:36.790 --> 17:38.690
 Miley:                         
 I think it'll be good for emily

17:38.692 --> 17:40.525
 If she can really              
 focus on this song             

17:40.527 --> 17:42.327
 And if someone can see         
 a little bit of joni in her.   

17:42.329 --> 17:44.796
We need someone like that       
in the music industry right now.

17:44.798 --> 17:46.331
 Maybe for, like,               
 a first verse,                 

17:46.333 --> 17:48.433
 It's just her and the guitar   
 in the beginning.              

17:48.435 --> 17:50.335
    Just so it seems like --    
     a little bit more dramatic.

17:50.337 --> 17:52.170
       Miley:                   
Yeah, just dramatic.            
                      Okay.     

17:52.172 --> 17:55.240
  ¶ don't it always seem to go ¶

18:02.883 --> 18:05.583
   She keeps getting better and 
   better. And you guessed it --

18:05.585 --> 18:07.218
            You haven't seen    
            the best of her yet.

18:11.958 --> 18:14.726
   Daly: These are the artists  
   representing team pharrell.  

18:14.728 --> 18:17.162
   Pharrell: On my team, i have 
    loads and loads of talent.  

18:17.164 --> 18:18.696
       It's the first time      
    that i've ever had a team   

18:18.698 --> 18:20.198
That was comprised of all women.

18:20.200 --> 18:21.933
              Blake:            
   Team pharrell is definitely  

18:21.935 --> 18:23.668
  An interesting one this year. 

18:23.670 --> 18:25.336
        But you never know      
          with that guy.        

18:25.338 --> 18:27.772
     He's super smart and --    
     and he definitely          
     knows what he's doing.     

18:27.774 --> 18:31.109
  Pharrell: I think that this is
   the year of the woman, 2016. 

18:31.111 --> 18:32.177
  I'm gonna go on record and say

18:32.179 --> 18:33.878
          That our team         
       is the team to beat.     

18:33.880 --> 18:36.314
    Daly: When we come back...  

18:36.316 --> 18:37.916
We'll see how adam and christina

18:37.918 --> 18:40.452
        Built their teams       
      for the live playoffs.    

18:40.454 --> 18:46.691
 ¶ come what may to blue bayou ¶

18:50.930 --> 18:53.898

18:53.900 --> 18:56.367
           Welcome back         
  to the road to the live shows.

18:56.369 --> 18:59.137
   Last season's winning coach, 
      adam levine, is back,     

18:59.139 --> 19:02.841
      And make no mistake --    
      he wants another win.     

19:02.843 --> 19:06.511
    Let's see how adam's team   
  made it to the live playoffs. 

19:06.513 --> 19:07.912
          Celebrate me!         

19:07.914 --> 19:11.816
     My team this season is     
a crazy cross-section of people.

19:11.818 --> 19:13.751
      Everyone's different.     
              Yes!              

19:13.753 --> 19:15.854
Adam: I got guys that are really
tried-and-true musicians...     

19:15.856 --> 19:17.689
              Yeah!             
  ...And some great raw talent  

19:17.691 --> 19:19.290
  That just needs to be         
  fully realized.               

19:19.292 --> 19:20.859
              Yeah!             
     [ cheers and applause ]    

19:20.861 --> 19:22.093
     Blake:                     
     You know, at this point,   

19:22.095 --> 19:23.628
I'm getting a little bit worried
about adam's team.              

19:23.630 --> 19:25.163
         He's picking up        
        some good artists.      

19:25.165 --> 19:26.598
  He does this to me every year.

19:26.600 --> 19:28.099
    He has me sweating it out.  

19:28.101 --> 19:30.869
 Daly: Let's look at the journey
        these five artists      

19:30.871 --> 19:34.038
    Took to the live playoffs.  

19:34.040 --> 19:37.041
  The first member of team adam 
         is brian nhira,        

19:37.043 --> 19:39.310
   Who has a strong connection  
     to his african heritage.   

19:39.312 --> 19:41.179
  My parents are from zimbabwe, 

19:41.181 --> 19:43.548
     And i've been to africa    
       on 10 mission trips.     

19:43.550 --> 19:44.549
                    Whoo!       

19:44.551 --> 19:47.085
        I want to inspire       
        these young people      

19:47.087 --> 19:49.621
        And let them know       
   that your dreams do matter.  

19:49.623 --> 19:52.624
   In this country,             
people are encouraged           

19:52.626 --> 19:54.225
To pursue their dream.          

19:54.227 --> 19:58.263
And now to know that my son     
is going to be on that stage,   

19:58.265 --> 20:02.100
Sometimes i pinch myself        
and say, "is that really true?" 

20:02.102 --> 20:04.269
      ¶ ohhh, because i'm ¶     

20:04.271 --> 20:05.803
  Daly: In the blind auditions, 
         he took a risk,        

20:05.805 --> 20:07.172
    Singing pharrell's song...  

20:07.174 --> 20:08.439
  ¶ like a room without a roof ¶

20:08.441 --> 20:10.675
  ...And got two chairs to turn.

20:10.677 --> 20:11.943
            Pharrell:           
  I felt like you went up there 

20:11.945 --> 20:12.844
       And you had yourself     
           a good time.         

20:12.846 --> 20:13.912
         I mean, clearly,       

20:13.914 --> 20:15.446
        You sing the song       
      much better than i do.

      daly: In the battles,     

20:23.924 --> 20:27.225
      Brian gave an intense     
  performance of a maroon 5 song

20:27.227 --> 20:30.762
That led both adam and christina
     to try and steal him.      

20:30.764 --> 20:33.665
              Whoa!             
      We got another steal!     

20:33.667 --> 20:35.366
                     Yes!       

20:35.368 --> 20:38.303
                Adam,           
      i want to be on your team.

                 I pick adam.

         Christina: Fair enough.

20:40.607 --> 20:43.875

         Congratulations.       

20:43.877 --> 20:45.143
 We'll see you in the knockouts.

20:45.145 --> 20:47.278
              Adam:             
  I got an amazing steal today. 

20:47.280 --> 20:49.948
  Brian is a major game-changer 
          for team adam.        

20:49.950 --> 20:51.983
      I'm extremely happy.

20:55.121 --> 20:57.755
 Miley cyrus and adam encouraged
        brian to open up.       

20:57.757 --> 21:00.525

    he is a wonderful singer.

21:08.335 --> 21:09.434
I feel like there was times     

21:09.436 --> 21:10.969
   That you, like,              
 wanted to go there,

           On my team.

   15-year-old caroline burns.

            Caroline:           
 A lot's changed since season 9.

21:56.883 --> 21:59.651
   I finally reached five feet. 

21:59.653 --> 22:03.121
         Can't you tell?        
         Like...One inch.

       Getting them to turn     
          their chairs.

Daly: During the battles,       
caroline received great coaching

22:26.713 --> 22:28.846
     From adam and his adviser, 
     tori kelly.                

22:28.848 --> 22:30.481
     Caroline: I was watching   
     her videos yesterday.

 i walked in, and there she was.

   Laith tried to play it safe  

24:40.647 --> 24:42.780
       By lowering the key      
      of his knockout song.

The emotion of what he's singing
    is coming out.              

24:53.493 --> 24:55.193

Strain.

              What's your story?

26:06.299 --> 26:07.298
  I grew up in a musical family.

26:07.300 --> 26:08.099
       My dad's a musician.     

26:08.101 --> 26:09.867
   So he had a band in the '70s 

26:09.869 --> 26:11.135
    That won a couple grammys   
            and stuff.

  Very heartbreaking            
and crushing and sensitive,     

26:21.681 --> 26:24.448
And that is a very difficult    
combination of things           

26:24.450 --> 26:26.050
To exist in one person.

              the right choice.

After winning his battle,       

26:41.668 --> 26:44.135
Adam and miley cyrus            
challenged owen                 

26:44.137 --> 26:46.337
To find his confidence          
during the knockouts.           

26:46.339 --> 26:49.340
   I'm begging you              
  to really dig deep            

26:49.342 --> 26:51.742
To understand the fact          
that you're really good.        

26:51.744 --> 26:54.812
    Owen's got a voice that's   
   not afraid to be vulnerable  

26:54.814 --> 26:56.814
       When he's not afraid     
          to show that.         

26:56.816 --> 26:59.250
   To me, as, like,             
the girl listening to this song,

26:59.252 --> 27:01.052
There's something more soulful  
  and, like, sexier             

27:01.054 --> 27:02.920
  About bringing it             
  back down smaller.            

27:02.922 --> 27:04.822
   It might make it             
   feel more real.              

27:04.824 --> 27:06.457
       Owen is someone that     
  the music industry could use. 

27:06.459 --> 27:07.692
      I think we always need    
           real artists         

27:07.694 --> 27:09.527
    That can play instruments.  

27:09.529 --> 27:11.829
   It's important to know music 
          from the past         

27:11.831 --> 27:13.331
  To be able to make good music 
          in the future.

     I'm not sure i've gotten   
     this far                   

33:19.799 --> 33:23.300
   With a country artist before,
   so this is exciting for me.  

33:23.302 --> 33:25.469
                    Mwah!       
               Congratulations.

         of our coaches.        
   Pfft!                        

33:40.353 --> 33:41.585
   I'm terrified of flying,     

33:41.587 --> 33:42.820
   And i'm, like,               
   the worst person to fly with.

33:42.822 --> 33:44.121
   And i always scream,         

33:44.123 --> 33:46.423
   "we're not getting enough    
   speed!" as we're taking off  

33:46.425 --> 33:48.092
  And everyone that's sitting by
  me is, like, really mis--     

33:48.094 --> 33:49.460
    That's nice. That must make 
   everybody really comfortable.

33:49.462 --> 33:50.561
It's really comforting,         
        yeah.                   
                       Yeah.

                    Wow.        

34:18.757 --> 34:20.524
     Tamar: I felt like maybe   
         i blew my chance       

34:20.525 --> 34:22.626
 At becoming a recording artist.

34:22.628 --> 34:25.629
      To be at this moment,     
  i'm gonna give it all i have.

   Her explosive blind audition 
  on an aretha franklin classic 

34:33.105 --> 34:35.839
     Earned her the attention   
       she's always wanted.     

34:35.841 --> 34:37.875
        It is time for you      
  to step out of the background.

34:37.877 --> 34:39.376
     You deserve your moment

   ¶ can i lay by your side? ¶  

35:12.078 --> 35:14.945
    Daly: ...Tamar stepped up   
     with help from christina   

35:14.947 --> 35:17.014
  During her knockout rehearsal.

35:17.016 --> 35:19.049
          You're putting        
         a little vibrato       

35:19.051 --> 35:20.517
            On the --           
    on the ends of every line.  

35:20.519 --> 35:21.652
             -Mm-hmm.           
    -I think you were doing...

       things away, like...     

35:25.157 --> 35:27.891
     ¶ yes, i do, i believe ¶   

35:27.893 --> 35:29.793
-Like, just choose your moments.
             -Okay.             

35:29.795 --> 35:33.063
   At 35, things that i thought 
         i mastered, no.        

35:33.065 --> 35:35.866
     Christina has showed me    
    there's still more growth.  

35:35.868 --> 35:40.537
   ¶ i lay by yo-o-o-ur side ¶  

35:40.539 --> 35:43.841
   Daly: And that growth was on 
 display when tamar sang her way

 Into next week's live playoffs.

35:50.716 --> 35:52.616
      Christina:                
      For the first time,       

35:52.618 --> 35:55.686
   I felt like the other coaches
   got to see exactly what i saw

35:55.688 --> 35:57.888
      In tamar since            
      those blind auditions.    

35:57.890 --> 36:00.891
 I'm going to the live playoffs!

36:00.893 --> 36:04.895
   Daly: Christina's next artist
   is 25-year-old ryan quinn,   

36:04.897 --> 36:06.563
      Who started on team adam. 

36:06.565 --> 36:09.733
    Ryan:                       
    I'm lucky enough to co-teach
    music classes for children  

36:09.735 --> 36:11.735
      That have suffered        
      varying degrees of trauma 

36:11.737 --> 36:12.469
      In their lives.           

36:12.471 --> 36:14.304
      ¶ near the end ¶          

36:14.306 --> 36:16.707
   Daly: He landed the attention
   of all four of our coaches   

36:16.709 --> 36:18.609
     During the blind auditions.

36:18.611 --> 36:20.911
   I've been around some of the 
  greatest singers in the world 

36:20.913 --> 36:22.613
        And, man, you are       
       one of those voices      

36:22.615 --> 36:24.481
      That needs to be heard    
            worldwide.          

36:24.483 --> 36:25.916
Adam: My music teacher          
   kept telling me,             

36:25.918 --> 36:27.084
"you've got a good voice.       
    You can sing."              

36:27.086 --> 36:28.152
  And he brought it             
  out of my slowly,             

36:28.154 --> 36:29.753
   And he was such              
an inspirational guy.           

36:29.755 --> 36:31.922
So, hearing that you do that    
is -- is really special.        

36:31.924 --> 36:33.490
          I pick adam.          
     [ cheers and applause ]    

36:33.492 --> 36:34.791
               Ohh!             

36:34.793 --> 36:38.328
        Did you come here       
     to break my heart, ryan?   

36:38.330 --> 36:41.665
         ¶ maybe i'm a man,     
   maybe you're the only woman ¶

36:41.667 --> 36:44.601
      ¶ who could ever help me ¶

36:44.603 --> 36:47.271
    Daly: During the battles,   
    ryan again impressed adam.  

36:47.273 --> 36:49.306
    The winner of this battle   
             is ryan.           

36:49.308 --> 36:51.008
              Daly:             
      Ryan's gonna move on.     

36:51.010 --> 36:53.644
      And in the knockouts,     
        when ryan lost...       

36:53.646 --> 36:55.145
     [ cheers and applause ]    

36:55.147 --> 36:57.814
Whoa, we got a steal!           
 Christina aguilera!            

36:57.816 --> 37:01.051
       ...Christina seized      
  her opportunity to steal him. 

37:01.053 --> 37:03.220
Adam dropped the ball!          
   I'm so excited!              

37:03.222 --> 37:05.355
         Yes!                   
    He's mine now.              

37:05.357 --> 37:06.323
      All mine.                 

37:06.325 --> 37:08.225
         The final artist       
        on team christina       

37:08.227 --> 37:10.761
       Is former child star     
          alisan porter.        

37:10.763 --> 37:14.064
  Alisan: The role i'm probably 
   most known for is curly sue. 

37:14.066 --> 37:15.599
              Daly:             
  Now with a family of her own, 

37:15.601 --> 37:18.335
She came to "the voice" in hopes
  of getting a second chance.   

37:18.337 --> 37:21.305
    ¶ i'm going back someday ¶  

37:21.307 --> 37:22.940
 ¶ come what may to blue bayou ¶

37:22.942 --> 37:25.042
        Daly: Her powerful      
  blind audition of "blue bayou"

37:25.044 --> 37:29.179
       Caught the attention     
       of all four coaches.     

37:29.181 --> 37:30.514
     With a voice like that,    

37:30.516 --> 37:32.482
     How did you guys ignore    
   the signs that this is what  

37:32.484 --> 37:34.117
   You're supposed to have been 
       doing all your life?     

37:34.119 --> 37:35.786
          I fell in love        
       and i had children,      

37:35.788 --> 37:38.689
      And i really feel like    
  the universe just had a plan, 

37:38.691 --> 37:40.524
         Because you guys       
       turned for me today.     

37:40.526 --> 37:42.559
              I really am moved 
                by your story.  

37:42.561 --> 37:44.928
             Nobody works harder
                 than a mom.    

37:44.930 --> 37:45.929
        I pick christina.       

37:45.931 --> 37:47.331
     [ cheers and applause ]    
                             oh!

37:47.333 --> 37:51.735
¶ i went for a walk ¶

37:56.408 --> 37:59.376
           Your talent          
       is undeniably great.     

37:59.378 --> 38:01.211
              Daly:             
 And after winning her battle...

38:01.213 --> 38:03.981
   ¶ it's coming on christmas ¶ 

38:03.983 --> 38:06.250
 ¶ they're cutting down trees ¶ 
              daly:             
 ...Alisan entered the knockouts

38:06.252 --> 38:09.119
 And christina and miley        
 coached her through her nerves.

38:09.121 --> 38:10.988
               It's scary --    
            just me and a piano.

38:10.990 --> 38:13.490
  Yeah.                         
               So i'm feeling   
           a little bit, like...

38:13.492 --> 38:15.058
Vulnerable? Naked?              
              Yeah.             

38:15.060 --> 38:17.427
                    Yeah.       
            All of those things.
I would be scared, too,         

38:17.429 --> 38:18.895
  But you can do it             
       justice.                 

38:18.897 --> 38:20.063
   I think, a lot of the times, 

38:20.065 --> 38:22.299
    Even when i'm doing, like,  
         one of my shows,       

38:22.301 --> 38:23.734
     My fans, the thing that    
        they love the most      

38:23.736 --> 38:25.269
        Is when it's just       
         me and a piano.        
                      Yeah.     

38:25.271 --> 38:27.170
      Just make                 
  some eye contact.             
                           Yeah.

38:27.172 --> 38:28.639
 I'm in your corner.            
 You can look at me.            

38:28.641 --> 38:31.174
'cause that tenderness          
  is what sells it.             

38:31.176 --> 38:33.810
            Alisan --           
    she's just such a rarity.   

38:33.812 --> 38:37.247
   She's putting a ton of heart 
          into her work.        

38:37.249 --> 38:41.485
¶ i wish i had a river so long ¶

38:41.487 --> 38:54.031

          to fly-y-y-y ¶        

38:54.033 --> 38:58.201
    Christina: I chose alisan   
   because she just is amazing. 

38:58.203 --> 38:59.803
      Her range is endless.     

38:59.805 --> 39:02.005
   I-i just connect with alisan 
             so much.           

39:02.007 --> 39:04.875
   Daly: These are the artists  
   representing team christina  

39:04.877 --> 39:06.343

          -[ chuckles ]         

40:48.514 --> 40:50.280
       You never know what      
         is gonna happen        

40:50.282 --> 40:51.882
         When miley cyrus       
     shows up to "the voice."   

40:51.884 --> 40:53.417
              This heart thing  
           right here is like --

40:53.419 --> 40:54.751
         -I just keep --        
          -it's amazing.        

40:54.753 --> 40:55.752
I, like, want to touch it,      

40:55.754 --> 40:57.254
But i don't want to be          
    inappropriate.              

40:57.256 --> 40:58.822
          Yeah, i feel like     
     it's inappropriate if i do.

40:58.824 --> 41:00.157
[ laughs ]                      
         i'm not gonna touch it.

41:00.159 --> 41:01.792
 But it does draw --            
but it does draw you in.        

41:01.794 --> 41:03.193
       It's like a pillow.      

41:03.195 --> 41:05.462
    Then again, you never know  
       what's gonna happen      

41:05.464 --> 41:08.465
    When miley cyrus shows up,  
             period.            

41:08.467 --> 41:09.699
       I used to be, like,      
          the bean girl.        

41:09.701 --> 41:11.535
   Do you know how embarrassing 
        that is at school?      

41:11.537 --> 41:12.669
           Wait, what bean girl?

41:12.671 --> 41:14.471
       So, my job for like      
       eight hours one day      

41:14.473 --> 41:16.072
       Was to go eat beans      
            on a set.           

41:16.074 --> 41:18.775
            It's like,          
   "country home baked beans,"  

41:18.777 --> 41:21.978
       And then it cuts to      
   a little girl going like...  

41:21.980 --> 41:23.580
        -...And that's me.      
          -Oh, my gosh.         

41:23.582 --> 41:26.550
      But i'd go to school,     
     and i was the bean girl.   

41:26.552 --> 41:28.618
      That's the worst thing    
      you can be in school.     

41:28.620 --> 41:29.753
       I love your outfit.      

41:29.755 --> 41:31.087
           -Thank you.          
         -That's awesome.       

41:31.089 --> 41:32.556
  We almost wore the same thing,
      but i made him change.    

41:32.558 --> 41:33.457
               -Oh.             
             -Mm-hmm.           

41:33.459 --> 41:35.058
Pink looks better on me.        
        Fuzzy.                  

41:35.060 --> 41:37.561
  I like my shrimps a bit fried.
        I like 'em fried.       

41:37.563 --> 41:40.497
   She's like my little sister, 
    my annoying little sister.  

41:40.499 --> 41:41.798
     I'm terrified of flying,   

41:41.800 --> 41:43.233
          And i'm, like,        
  the worst person to fly with. 

41:43.235 --> 41:45.268
   I always scream, "we're not  
      getting enough speed!"    

41:45.270 --> 41:46.736
       As we're taking f.       

41:46.738 --> 41:48.338
  And everyone that's sitting by
    me is, like, really mis--   

41:48.340 --> 41:49.606
    That's nice. That must make 
   everybody really comfortable.

41:49.608 --> 42:05.255
It's really comforting,         
        yeah.                   
                         Yeah.
