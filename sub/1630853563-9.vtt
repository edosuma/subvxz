WEBVTT

00:15.333 --> 00:17.416
-Whoa!

00:19.625 --> 00:21.250
Ah!

00:26.916 --> 00:28.500
-Ah! No!
-Huh?

00:30.625 --> 00:31.458
Ah!

00:32.583 --> 00:33.416
Ouch!

00:43.291 --> 00:44.375
Phew.

00:46.000 --> 00:47.958
-Hey!

01:17.625 --> 01:20.041
Okay, we got to be super quiet.

01:25.125 --> 01:26.208
We're busted.

01:26.291 --> 01:28.833
Wow. Josh is a way better security guard.

01:28.916 --> 01:30.958
We literally never did our jobs.

01:31.041 --> 01:32.083
Oh, come on, Pugsley.

01:32.166 --> 01:34.291
You must have read
some kind of spell we could use.

01:34.375 --> 01:35.958
Like a teleport or distraction.

01:36.041 --> 01:40.000
I was practicing one spell,
but I was saving it for Barney's birthday.

01:40.083 --> 01:41.500
Aw. Buddy.

01:46.291 --> 01:48.708
-Do it.
-All right. Here goes.

01:49.250 --> 01:53.000
Bippity boopity Patti LuPoney
mankin tessori manzela Minnelli!

01:57.625 --> 02:00.125
Well, whatever happened is not happening.

02:25.000 --> 02:26.083
What is happening?

02:26.166 --> 02:27.333
Happy birthday.

02:27.416 --> 02:28.250
But…

03:10.750 --> 03:13.125
Pugsley? Why is everyone singing?

03:13.208 --> 03:16.500
Oh, no, why am I dancing?

03:22.541 --> 03:25.833
Norma, you said distraction.
Well, this is my reaction.

03:25.916 --> 03:29.208
A magical musical
to help us sneak through.

03:29.291 --> 03:32.416
But I guess it worked too well
'cause we're all under this spell.

03:32.500 --> 03:35.250
Gosh, I really hope it wears off
before Act Two.

03:40.333 --> 03:42.291
How far reaching is this spell?

03:42.375 --> 03:43.375
Well…

05:23.500 --> 05:24.375
Oh.

05:40.541 --> 05:42.083
Are you ready?

05:42.166 --> 05:45.375
Almost. The flies are in the web.

05:45.458 --> 05:48.916
All I have to do now is choose.

05:58.208 --> 05:59.791
No need to be dramatic.

05:59.875 --> 06:02.041
No need for you to be so creepy.

06:02.125 --> 06:04.500
We wouldn't have suspected you
if you hadn't been so suspicious.

06:04.583 --> 06:06.291
So you believe me now?

06:06.375 --> 06:09.291
We saw the footage. I'm so sorry.

06:09.375 --> 06:12.166
Don't be sorry. Be ready. Look.

06:22.625 --> 06:23.791
What is this?

06:23.875 --> 06:26.000
Pauline is holding auditions
for her next body.

06:26.083 --> 06:26.958
Bingo.

06:27.041 --> 06:29.708
I'm sorry I doubted you, Barborah.
I was just--

06:29.791 --> 06:31.833
Tangled in Pauline's glittery web.

06:31.916 --> 06:33.375
Believe me, I've been there,

06:33.458 --> 06:36.166
and it cost me the best years of my life.

06:36.250 --> 06:38.250
We have to save the next poor soul.

06:38.333 --> 06:39.458
Easy-peasy.

06:39.541 --> 06:41.666
I'll win the audition
and get possessed by Pauline,

06:41.750 --> 06:43.833
then you guys can exorcise her out of me.

06:43.916 --> 06:45.583
Uh, it's too risky.

06:45.666 --> 06:47.208
We did it before with Temeluchus.

06:47.291 --> 06:49.375
We can do it again with Pauline. Trust me.

06:49.458 --> 06:52.791
No offense, kid,
but I don't see you winning this audition.

06:55.458 --> 06:57.333
Look, Norma will kill it.

06:57.416 --> 06:59.458
You just need a little makeover.

06:59.541 --> 07:02.875
Pugsley, anything in that old memory
of yours that could help us out?

07:02.958 --> 07:05.291
This is a lot of magic for one day.

07:05.375 --> 07:08.583
Pugsley, if we don't do something,
Pauline will never stop.

07:08.666 --> 07:11.916
Okay. Okay. I'll try my best.

07:19.375 --> 07:21.208
Good afternoon, my darlings.

07:21.791 --> 07:23.708
Show me what you're made of.

07:26.083 --> 07:26.916
Next.

07:27.000 --> 07:29.166
Oh, my ghost.
I can't believe I'm here.

07:29.250 --> 07:31.250
-You got me through the toughest year--
-Next!

07:31.333 --> 07:32.583
-Wrong.

07:33.875 --> 07:36.916
Go! Now!
Oh, anything but that.

07:37.000 --> 07:38.541
What's wrong with you?

07:38.625 --> 07:41.458
Can't I find a girl who can
actually give me what I'm looking for?

07:41.541 --> 07:45.375
-Heart, soul, the burning passion of a--

07:45.958 --> 07:47.708
Hello, gorgeous.

07:48.583 --> 07:50.875
Come on, Norma. You can do this.

09:08.958 --> 09:09.791
Norma?

10:26.666 --> 10:30.958
You.
Come to my dressing room. Now.

10:37.916 --> 10:41.583
Well, if it isn't
the humans and dogs only club.

10:41.666 --> 10:44.083
Courtney, we're sorry. We need your help.

10:44.166 --> 10:45.625
Too late.

10:45.708 --> 10:47.041
I got a new best friend.

10:47.125 --> 10:50.166
Someone who's actually helping me go home.

11:33.291 --> 11:35.708
Darling, could you do me
a little favor here?

12:09.541 --> 12:12.250
What friend? What's going on, Courtney?

12:49.583 --> 12:51.125
Greetings, y'all.

12:51.208 --> 12:55.500
Yes, I know. I look amazing.
I'm a whole new me.

12:56.166 --> 12:58.083
Norma. Ah. She did it.

12:58.166 --> 13:01.375
Mm-mm. Don't you dare use my middle name.

13:01.458 --> 13:04.083
Guards, throw these traitors
into the dungeon.

13:09.875 --> 13:12.958
Quick, Barney!
I-I can't hold them long.

13:13.041 --> 13:16.416
Stupid skinny jeans. Ah.

13:17.958 --> 13:19.125
Say "cheese".

13:19.708 --> 13:22.083
-Huh? Courtney?

13:22.166 --> 13:24.125
-Argh!
-Pugsley!

13:24.208 --> 13:27.166
Tut-tut. Pictures cost extra, sweetie.

13:27.250 --> 13:28.375
Take these two away.

13:28.458 --> 13:30.583
Oh, and keep an eye on 'em.

13:30.666 --> 13:31.833
Let's go, Red.

13:39.583 --> 13:41.333
Logs, listen to me.

13:41.416 --> 13:44.083
Sorry, Barney. I don't want to do this.

13:45.666 --> 13:46.666
Then don't.

13:46.750 --> 13:49.916
I can't lose my job.
That's Pauline Phoenix.

13:50.000 --> 13:51.791
I don't want to get on her bad side.

13:51.875 --> 13:53.750
She's all bad side.

13:55.125 --> 13:56.875
Use your magic to break the lock.

13:56.958 --> 13:59.500
I can't, Barney. Too much magic.

13:59.583 --> 14:02.333
And every time I use it,
I can feel him coming--

14:02.416 --> 14:03.541
Back!

14:05.416 --> 14:07.708
Can't you talk to Logs? Sweeten him up?

14:07.791 --> 14:09.958
Have a little… flirt?

14:10.041 --> 14:11.333
Shh. He'll hear.

14:12.500 --> 14:14.541
You do like him, don't you?

14:14.625 --> 14:16.875
But…

14:16.958 --> 14:20.333
Logs thinks I'm a traitor now.
So, he's just--

14:20.416 --> 14:23.416
A bit more of a challenge,
but still objectively a dreamboat?

14:23.500 --> 14:25.333
No. No.

16:03.208 --> 16:06.208
-Did you say something, Barney?
-Uh, yeah. I, uh--

16:06.291 --> 16:07.875
Go on, say it.

16:07.958 --> 16:10.666
Logs,
Pauline is abducting impersonators.

16:10.750 --> 16:12.541
She abducted Jennifer Swan
and she's gonna do it again.

16:12.625 --> 16:14.208
This whole comeback show
is an act, a scam.

16:14.291 --> 16:15.916
She locked us up
'cause we found out, I swear.

16:16.000 --> 16:18.000
We have to stop her.
Also, you're really cute.

16:18.083 --> 16:20.583
Want to go see a movie or something?
Huh?

16:21.333 --> 16:22.833
I knew it.

16:22.916 --> 16:23.916
About Pauline?

16:24.000 --> 16:26.625
No, that you wanted to ask me out.

16:26.708 --> 16:28.875
I've been trying to
ask you out all summer.

16:28.958 --> 16:31.208
I've been a trying to
ask you out all summer.

16:31.291 --> 16:32.791
-Really?
-Yeah.

16:33.291 --> 16:34.583
Uh, can you let us out now?

16:34.666 --> 16:37.541
You know, Norma in danger?
Pauline bad? Really bad?

16:37.625 --> 16:38.750
Oh. Let me get that.

16:42.291 --> 16:44.750
Do what you gotta do. Shall we say Friday?

16:44.833 --> 16:46.208
W-W-What movie?

16:46.291 --> 16:47.625
Anything but musicals.

16:50.375 --> 16:52.000
<i>The Pauline Phoenix</i>

16:52.083 --> 16:56.541
<i>Anniversary Comeback Extravaganza concert</i>
<i>will commence shortly.</i>

16:56.625 --> 17:00.208
<i>Please remember that all video</i>
<i>and photography is strictly prohibited.</i>

17:04.291 --> 17:08.416
Phoenix Parks, your queen has arrived.

17:17.750 --> 17:20.041
Come on, kids. Y'all know the words.

17:20.125 --> 17:23.375
Seal the body up.
Seal the body up.

17:23.458 --> 17:26.625
Pull, pull, smash, smash, smash.

17:26.708 --> 17:29.333
Seal the body up. Seal the body up.

17:29.416 --> 17:32.791
Pull, pull, smash, smash, smash.

17:39.916 --> 17:42.000
Bring me my encore!

18:07.125 --> 18:10.458
Bless your heart.

18:12.166 --> 18:13.750
Courtney, you got to stop.

18:13.833 --> 18:15.333
What's it take for a demon to get

18:15.416 --> 18:17.666
an uninterrupted sealing spell
around here?

18:18.666 --> 18:22.041
That's Norma onstage, Courtney.
She's under an illusion spell.

18:22.125 --> 18:24.625
I don't care. You don't understand.

18:24.708 --> 18:25.708
I do understand.

18:25.791 --> 18:28.583
Look, I know what it's like
wanting to go home, but--

18:28.666 --> 18:31.458
But you can! You can skip home whenever.

18:31.541 --> 18:33.166
You just choose not to.

18:33.250 --> 18:35.541
I can't go home ever!

18:35.625 --> 18:38.250
What makes you think Pauline has
the kind of power to send you home

18:38.333 --> 18:39.916
if she needs you for this?

18:40.000 --> 18:41.500
I… I don't--

18:41.583 --> 18:45.291
She lied to you.
She used you like she uses everyone.

18:49.583 --> 18:51.208
Pauline!

18:51.291 --> 18:52.375
Is this true?

18:52.458 --> 18:54.041
Is what true, Red?

18:54.125 --> 18:56.583
You don't know
how to send me home, do you?

18:56.666 --> 18:58.166
You just wanted the spell.

18:58.750 --> 19:00.625
Oh. So you figured it out.

19:01.875 --> 19:04.041
I may not be able to open the elevator,

19:04.125 --> 19:06.625
but I can send you to
the underworld another way.

19:06.708 --> 19:09.458
Bring it on!

19:09.541 --> 19:11.708
Courtney, no. That's Norma.

19:11.791 --> 19:12.625
Pugsley.

19:12.708 --> 19:13.958
Pugsley?

19:16.583 --> 19:17.625
Stop!

19:17.708 --> 19:20.875
Courtney, stop!

19:22.958 --> 19:23.875
Pugsley!

19:23.958 --> 19:27.125
Is that… Barney? Why is he in the show?

19:27.208 --> 19:28.916
-It's not a show.
-Patrick!

19:33.291 --> 19:34.250
Pugsley?

19:34.333 --> 19:36.625
It's too late. He's taken over.

19:36.708 --> 19:37.666
What? Who?

19:37.750 --> 19:39.333
-Me!

19:40.791 --> 19:42.583
Oh, no you don't!

19:42.666 --> 19:45.458
Oh, don't mind if I do.

21:48.208 --> 21:49.958
Pugsley, are you okay?

21:54.416 --> 21:58.666
I'm back. And my body is fully restored.

21:58.750 --> 22:01.375
Hey! This is my comeback show.

22:01.458 --> 22:02.708
Ha!

22:02.791 --> 22:04.250
Well, well, well.

22:04.333 --> 22:07.416
It looks like the old mutt
was having some fun.

22:08.000 --> 22:10.000
What do you think you're doing?

22:10.083 --> 22:12.250
I'm the big bad around here.

22:12.333 --> 22:13.333
Ugh.

22:15.541 --> 22:16.916
No!

22:18.500 --> 22:20.750
-Norma!

22:21.916 --> 22:23.000
Gotcha.

22:23.958 --> 22:25.000
Are you okay?

22:25.500 --> 22:27.416
-Did we win?

22:27.500 --> 22:28.625
Not really.

22:38.666 --> 22:39.666
-Patrick?
-Patrick?

22:39.750 --> 22:41.291
-Patrick?
-Patrick?

23:10.750 --> 23:11.583
Sorry.

23:57.583 --> 23:58.416
-Uh…
-Oh.

23:59.541 --> 24:01.041
Those aren't demon cuffs.

24:01.125 --> 24:01.958
What?

24:02.041 --> 24:03.708
Those were placed by angels.

24:03.791 --> 24:05.000
Angels?

24:05.541 --> 24:09.083
But an enemy of the angels
is a friend of mine.

24:12.750 --> 24:14.333
Go right ahead, comrade.

24:14.416 --> 24:16.750
We need more demons like you down there.

24:16.833 --> 24:19.250
Yes! I'm getting out of here.

24:19.333 --> 24:21.583
Courtney. Are you leaving?

24:22.583 --> 24:26.541
I'm like a thousand years old.
I knew you guys for like five minutes.

24:27.875 --> 24:29.291
I'm sorry.

24:29.375 --> 24:31.625
If you don't die tonight,
I'll send you a postcard.

24:33.875 --> 24:36.000
Barney, I can't find Patrick!

24:36.083 --> 24:37.875
-Mom!
-Oh, keep it down.

24:37.958 --> 24:39.791
-Patrick! Patrick!
-Patrick--

24:41.000 --> 24:41.875
Mom!

24:45.333 --> 24:47.875
I said keep it down.

24:57.708 --> 25:00.458
Much better.

25:00.541 --> 25:03.250
So, Tem, you gonna show me your castle?

25:03.333 --> 25:06.500
I've been dying to see what you've done
with this miserable plane.

25:06.583 --> 25:08.291
It would be my pleasure.

25:47.291 --> 25:48.125
Mild.
