00:08.279 --> 00:09.843
Are the police out there yet?

00:09.844 --> 00:10.876
No.

00:10.878 --> 00:12.178
I'm going to call them again.

00:12.180 --> 00:14.113
Curtis, I've already
called them three times.

00:14.115 --> 00:15.181
Well, what did they say?

00:15.183 --> 00:17.347
They said that this is not an emergency,

00:17.347 --> 00:19.147
and there's a game tonight.

00:19.148 --> 00:21.489
They're going to send somebody
over here when they can.

00:21.683 --> 00:23.286
Where's my mama?

00:23.286 --> 00:24.818
Oh, she'll be back, baby.

00:24.820 --> 00:25.753
Where'd she go?

00:26.019 --> 00:27.110
To the store.

00:27.220 --> 00:28.966
Oh, you a lying Christian.

00:30.790 --> 00:33.691
Ryan, can you take the
kids into the office?

00:33.693 --> 00:34.792
Yes, ma'am.

00:34.794 --> 00:36.402
And don't touch nothing.

00:39.399 --> 00:42.133
Curtis, what else would you
have me say to those kids?

00:42.735 --> 00:44.452
Why you going to lie to them?

00:44.671 --> 00:46.504
Just a thought, how about the truth?

00:46.506 --> 00:47.838
Well, it would break their hearts.

00:47.840 --> 00:50.267
- And a lie won't?
- Oh, hush, Curtis.

00:50.821 --> 00:51.794
Hey, kids.

00:51.795 --> 00:54.095
I got a story to tell you about your mama.

00:54.764 --> 00:56.259

00:56.732 --> 00:58.484
Do it, and die.

01:09.701 --> 01:10.933
Baby, they need to know.

01:10.934 --> 01:13.268
And I will tell them soon.

01:13.270 --> 01:15.270
Well, you need to tell them
sooner than later, Ella,

01:15.272 --> 01:16.971
'cause when the police come,

01:16.973 --> 01:18.344
they're going with them.

01:19.976 --> 01:22.054
Oh, no, they not. They going with y'all.

01:22.054 --> 01:24.280
- No, they are not.
- Curtis.

01:24.706 --> 01:28.074
She asked us to keep an eye
on these children when she...

01:28.076 --> 01:30.328
You see, that's what I'm
talking about right there, Ella.

01:30.353 --> 01:31.305

01:31.330 --> 01:33.361
You don't have any legal
rights to those kids.

And you know you got a bad eye.

01:37.635 --> 01:39.101
It don't matter what she said, Ella.

01:39.103 --> 01:40.602
They're not going to let them go.

01:40.604 --> 01:42.417

02:04.047 --> 02:05.529
This is not funny.

These kids can end up in foster homes

02:07.971 --> 02:09.738

02:09.740 --> 02:11.773
