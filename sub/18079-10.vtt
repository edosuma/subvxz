and start the whole thing
all over again.

41:56.180 --> 41:57.909
HANNlBAL: Well, there it is.

41:58.048 --> 42:00.812
It's got half a million
dollars of diamonds in it.

42:02.520 --> 42:04.044
Go scout it out.

42:07.791 --> 42:10.692
What is going on here, my son?

42:10.828 --> 42:12.523
You didn't say nothing
about no monks.

42:12.596 --> 42:14.928
Well, monks do go with
the monastery now, don't they?

42:14.999 --> 42:16.626
I understand you've
got some diamonds.

42:16.700 --> 42:20.796
Men of God have no need
for such baubles.

42:21.305 --> 42:23.398
You better not be
trying to con me, sport.

42:29.513 --> 42:31.947
This is the bloke
that shot at us.

42:32.016 --> 42:33.608
He ain't no monk.

42:33.684 --> 42:35.549
Well, I just signed up.

43:44.221 --> 43:48.419
I mean, this has no power.
It can't guide or protect you,
that's the truth.

43:49.660 --> 43:52.959
It's wisdom
and knowledge
that will guide you

43:53.030 --> 43:55.123
and heaven knows
you have enough of that.

43:55.199 --> 43:58.965
But there is something
I'd like to give to you

43:59.269 --> 44:01.635
as a sign of respect

44:02.106 --> 44:05.200
for all that you have
taught me.

That should scare off
any enemies.

44:47.418 --> 44:48.407
Leesa.

44:48.819 --> 44:50.013
Yes?

44:50.087 --> 44:52.282
I must go.
You understand that?

44:52.356 --> 44:55.052
Yes. But someday

44:56.560 --> 44:57.857
you will return?

STOCKWELL ON RADlO:
Come in, Empress Two.

45:12.843 --> 45:14.640
Come in, Empress Two.

45:15.045 --> 45:16.706
This is Empress One to ground.

45:16.780 --> 45:18.304
Sounds like our ride.

45:18.382 --> 45:20.714
Back to reality.

45:21.251 --> 45:23.719
You know, we really gotta
come back here someday.

45:23.854 --> 45:26.448
You know, and just
spend some time
relaxing in the sun.

45:26.523 --> 45:28.081
Respond, Colonel Smith.

45:28.692 --> 45:30.182
Respond please.

45:31.595 --> 45:32.960
Hello, Stockwell.

45:33.764 --> 45:36.062
Come on down.
We got the skull.

45:36.266 --> 45:37.563
Yes, I can see that.

45:37.634 --> 45:39.499
I've got you on the plane's
surveillance system.

45:41.438 --> 45:43.804
Everybody wave to the General.

45:44.708 --> 45:46.175
Hi, General.

45:48.746 --> 45:50.304
You like that, Stockwell?

45:50.380 --> 45:52.439
I can also see quite a party
going on down there.

45:52.516 --> 45:54.211
I knew you were on vacation.

45:54.284 --> 45:55.478
Now, General...

45:55.619 --> 45:56.608
Save it.

45:57.187 --> 46:00.714
This is the last time
you get an easy mission,

Talk to you later.
