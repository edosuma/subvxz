WEBVTT

00:00.026 --> 00:03.257
- I get the feeling I know you.
- I've had the same feeling.

00:03.293 --> 00:05.193
<i>What are your intentions?</i>

00:05.228 --> 00:07.253
- That'll take a week.
- Here they come!

00:10.533 --> 00:13.297
There's an aeroplane
in Robin Masters' tidal pool.

00:13.336 --> 00:15.201
Higgins, I didn't put it there!

00:16.572 --> 00:20.508
- I am sorry about the accident.
- I do not believe in accidents.

00:21.244 --> 00:23.838
You terrified a couple of kids. Satisfied?

02:03.012 --> 02:05.742
What's the password?

02:07.450 --> 02:09.281
Close enough.

02:15.458 --> 02:20.623
Gandalf, this is Frodo.
Do you read me? Over. Do you read me?

02:20.663 --> 02:23.154
Over. Do you read me?

02:24.467 --> 02:28.460
Gandalf, this is Frodo.
Do you read me? Over.

02:29.672 --> 02:33.938
Gandalf, this is Frodo.
Do you read me? Over.

02:34.444 --> 02:36.776
Do you read me?

02:45.989 --> 02:46.978
It's El Jefe.

02:53.563 --> 02:58.023
Gandalf, this is Frodo.
Do you read me? Over.

02:59.035 --> 03:01.367
Nothing yet.

03:01.404 --> 03:04.703
Gandalf, this is Frodo.
Do you read me? Over.

03:06.576 --> 03:09.739
- How you doing?
- OK. A little shaky.

03:09.779 --> 03:12.805
Don't worry, T.C.'ll find us.

03:13.716 --> 03:18.949
- He's gotta. I got money on it.
- Someone bet we wouldn't make it?

03:18.988 --> 03:23.322
I didn't bet they wouldn't make it.
I bet they'd never find that Navy pilot.

03:23.359 --> 03:25.486
- Same thing, Orville.
- No, it ain't.

03:25.528 --> 03:29.464
Either they didn't make it
or they went up the valley.

03:29.499 --> 03:32.161
- Where?
- Somewhere up in here.

03:33.202 --> 03:35.193
- Damn!
- What? Where'd they go?

03:35.238 --> 03:37.900
- Cambodia.
- Cambodia?

03:37.940 --> 03:42.240
- We ain't supposed to go into Cambodia.
- We ain't supposed to die young either.

04:05.468 --> 04:07.299
- What was that?
- Claymore?

04:07.336 --> 04:10.999
- El Jefe rigged a booby trap.
- I got them. Gandalf, this is Frodo.

04:11.040 --> 04:16.410
We're three clicks west of the Srepok.
An old temple. Come in from the northeast.

04:24.454 --> 04:28.413
Tell T.C. to orbit out a couple of clicks
till we get TacAir in here.

04:32.995 --> 04:35.259
Frodo, say those coordinates again.

04:35.298 --> 04:40.793
<i>Three clicks west of the Srepok River.
Grid 994/372.</i>

04:43.139 --> 04:49.009
Frodo, those coordinates are inside
Cambodia. What are you doing in there?

05:01.457 --> 05:04.585
Gargoyle wants to know
what we're doing here.

05:04.627 --> 05:07.619
Tac-Com, this is Frodo Leader.

05:07.663 --> 05:11.258
We were pushed in here by VC
who didn't get their passports stamped.

05:11.300 --> 05:13.291
If they can come in, so can you.

05:13.336 --> 05:16.703
Sorry, I can't authorize
without special clearances.

05:16.739 --> 05:21.904
- Damn it, Gargoyle, that'll take a week.
- You will use proper radio procedure...

05:21.944 --> 05:26.779
<i>Frodo, this is Hawk Leader, I'm low on fuel,
but within two minutes of your coordinates.</i>

05:26.816 --> 05:31.685
Hawk Leader, this is Tac-Com.
I'm in charge. What are your intentions?

05:31.721 --> 05:34.690
<i>I repeat, what are your intentions?</i>

05:34.724 --> 05:39.161
<i>I'll encourage those VC harassing Frodo
to mosey on back to Vietnam.</i>

05:48.704 --> 05:49.796
Here they come!

06:22.972 --> 06:27.432
- Thanks, Hawk Leader, we're outta here.
- Know what you boys are holed up in?

06:27.476 --> 06:32.846
That's a Khmer temple. I've never heard
of one this far east of Angkor. Unless...

06:32.882 --> 06:36.841
<i>There's this legend about a Khmer monk
who stole a gold cobra from Angkor Wat.</i>

06:36.886 --> 06:39.855
- <i>Built a temple out in the jungle</i>.
- Say again.

06:39.889 --> 06:41.948
Is there a stone cobra guarding it?

06:44.961 --> 06:48.624
We gotta go. Thanks for the support.
Our lift home's here.

06:51.033 --> 06:55.902
Wait, take a look around. You could be
sitting on a real archeological treasure.

06:55.938 --> 07:00.875
<i>I'm telling you, you boys could've found
the Temple of the Lost Cobra.</i>

07:00.910 --> 07:03.105
<i>Hawk Leader, this is Tac-Com</i>.

07:03.145 --> 07:05.409
Get out of there now. That's an order.

07:05.448 --> 07:09.646
Take it easy. I wanna make sure
I can find these ruins after the war.

07:09.685 --> 07:11.915
That jet jock's nuts!

07:11.954 --> 07:14.946
But he saved our butts
and you owe me 50 bucks!

07:19.595 --> 07:22.086
<i>This is your final warning. Get out of therel.</i>

07:22.131 --> 07:23.996
Now, Hawk Leader, now!

07:24.600 --> 07:28.434
<i>For a boy who ain't getting shot at,
you sure are nervous, Gargoyle.</i>

07:28.471 --> 07:32.305
<i>But seeing as how I'm low on fuel,
I guess I'll have to oblige.</i>

08:35.504 --> 08:41.340
Honolulu Approach, 9-4 Delta declaring
an emergency. Eight miles east of...

08:46.816 --> 08:49.979
Eight miles out
and I've just become a glider.

08:53.823 --> 08:58.317
<i>Believe it or not, even paradise
has its problems. Take this morning.</i>

08:58.361 --> 09:01.694
<i>I went for my usual run along the road
and nearly got hit twice</i>

09:01.731 --> 09:04.723
<i>by tourists on motorbikes
gawking at the scenery.</i>

09:04.767 --> 09:08.760
<i>When that happens, I know someone
is trying to tell me something.</i>

09:08.804 --> 09:11.637
<i>Like, get off the road before you get killed</i>.

09:11.674 --> 09:14.871
<i>Running on the beach was tougher,
but definitely safer.</i>

10:07.496 --> 10:08.485
You all right?

10:09.632 --> 10:11.725
Yeah, yeah.

10:11.767 --> 10:12.961
What happened?

10:17.139 --> 10:18.128
I ran out of gas.

10:19.909 --> 10:24.676
I would've made it, but some health nut
was in the way and I had to side-slip...

10:28.317 --> 10:29.477
Guess that was you.

10:32.555 --> 10:33.681
Yeah.

10:34.557 --> 10:37.492
Well, if I'd have had a horn,
I'd have honked it.

10:39.195 --> 10:42.062
- Hey, where you going?
- To get my hat.

10:43.599 --> 10:45.863
Oh, my God!

10:45.901 --> 10:48.961
- Magnum, what have you done?
- What?

10:49.004 --> 10:51.768
There's an aeroplane
in Robin Masters' tidal pool.

10:51.807 --> 10:55.368
Well, Higgins, I didn't put it there. He did.

10:59.415 --> 11:02.475
- Howdy!
- You can't land your aeroplane there.

11:03.519 --> 11:07.785
Didn't have much choice.
You see, this fella was running on the beach.

11:07.823 --> 11:11.020
- I knew it!
- What? I was running on my own beach?

11:11.060 --> 11:13.722
It's not yours, it's Robin Masters' beach.

11:13.762 --> 11:16.526
If you'd run on the road,
this wouldn't have happened.

11:16.565 --> 11:20.831
Hold your horses, pardner,
did you say Robin Masters? The writer?

11:20.870 --> 11:24.670
Yes. You've deposited your aeroplane
in his tidal pool.

11:24.707 --> 11:27.699
Well, don't that beat all?

11:27.743 --> 11:31.645
My grandpappy said something good
always comes out of something bad.

11:31.680 --> 11:34.171
- He said it till the day they hung him.
- Hung him?

11:34.216 --> 11:38.312
Even then he was right.
A widow woman collected the reward.

11:38.354 --> 11:42.347
What has that to do with
your crashing into Robin Masters' tidal pool?

11:42.391 --> 11:46.760
You see, I have this theory
about the legend of the lost clipper.

11:46.795 --> 11:50.128
The one Robin Masters wrote about
in Golden Trade Winds.

11:50.165 --> 11:54.158
Robin Masters is not here.
Robin Masters is rarely here.

11:54.203 --> 11:58.264
Your aeroplane, however, is.
I want it out of his tidal pool immediately.

11:58.307 --> 12:02.209
Well, it ain't my aeroplane, pardner.
I was just ferrying it here.

12:03.212 --> 12:08.707
But you have a point. I should let the fella
I was delivering it to know what happened.

12:08.751 --> 12:11.276
I can't figure out how I ran outta gas.

12:11.954 --> 12:15.617
I had this flight figured to the last drop.
Had to. It was a long haul.

12:15.658 --> 12:19.253
- Did you come from the big island?
- No. Van Nuys.

12:23.365 --> 12:24.354
California.

12:32.202 --> 12:34.193
Sam Houston Hunter.

12:34.241 --> 12:36.402
Yes, ma'am, I am from Texas.

12:36.444 --> 12:40.437
Oh, yes, ma'am, I have a ticket.
It just... It just needs to dry out.

12:42.149 --> 12:45.141
My son's ten tomorrow.
I gotta get home. Thanks.

12:45.186 --> 12:48.587
- Where's home?
- Waco, Texas.

12:48.622 --> 12:53.025
Magnum, you've done a whole lot
for a fella who almost flew into you,

12:53.060 --> 12:56.791
but could I ask you just one more favor?

12:56.831 --> 12:59.994
When do you have to be at the airport?

13:00.034 --> 13:04.562
My flight takes off in 43 minutes,
but I figure you for a hot driver with a hot car.

13:07.341 --> 13:10.742
What do they pay you
to ferry those puddle-jumpers here?

13:10.778 --> 13:13.713
- 1,000 bucks and a return ticket.
- Not enough.

13:13.748 --> 13:15.079
Did you fly in Nam?

13:15.950 --> 13:19.408
- Two tours. You?
- Three tours. On the ground.

13:19.453 --> 13:25.585
I get the feeling I know you, but I never
forget a name and yours doesn't click.

13:25.626 --> 13:29.562
I've had the same feeling about you,
only I never forget a face.

13:29.597 --> 13:31.929
I'd remember one as ugly as yours. No!

13:31.966 --> 13:33.957
<i>Not you, Mr. Sato</i>.

13:35.236 --> 13:38.000
I should hope not.

13:38.039 --> 13:43.102
I was growing concerned,
but now that you are in Honolulu, I can relax.

13:43.811 --> 13:47.474
Well, I'm not exactly in Honolulu.

13:47.515 --> 13:50.746
<i>Where exactly are you, Mr. Hunter?</i>

13:50.785 --> 13:54.380
Robin Masters' estate.
You know, the writer. It's quite a place.

13:54.422 --> 13:58.085
I'm sure it is.
Mr. Hunter, what are you doing there?

13:59.093 --> 14:00.822
I... landed here.

14:04.498 --> 14:07.990
You landed on Robin Masters' estate?

14:08.035 --> 14:13.530
Well, not exactly on his estate.
It's more like... in his tidal pool.

14:15.242 --> 14:17.472
Are you saying my airplane is in the ocean?

14:18.679 --> 14:22.410
All but a wing and a tail,
but I don't want you to worry about it.

14:22.450 --> 14:26.477
We'll get a new bird ready for you
in a couple of weeks. No charge.

14:26.520 --> 14:30.923
What's going to happen to my old bird...
as you put it?

14:30.958 --> 14:33.791
<i>The insurance company will sell her for junk</i>.

14:33.828 --> 14:37.355
Once a plane's been in salt water,
she's a total loss.

14:38.032 --> 14:40.796
I am sorry about the accident, Mr. Sato.

14:40.835 --> 14:43.099
So am I, Mr. Hunter.

14:44.138 --> 14:45.469
So am I.

14:52.546 --> 14:56.141
- You know where Robin Masters' estate is?
- Yes, sir.

14:58.285 --> 15:02.119
- I do not believe in accidents.
- I understand, sir.

15:04.091 --> 15:05.080
OK.

15:07.027 --> 15:11.396
<i>Don't ask me how,
but we actually made it to the airport in time.</i>

15:11.432 --> 15:14.196
<i>The police escort helped.
I don't know why I did it.</i>

15:14.235 --> 15:18.001
<i>Maybe because getting home for
his son's birthday was so important to him</i>

15:18.038 --> 15:23.203
<i>or maybe it was a funny feeling I couldn't
shake that somehow I owed him one.</i>

15:49.503 --> 15:54.304
<i>This is Van Nuys Airport security
paging Superintendent Meyers...</i>

15:54.341 --> 15:55.706
Boy, sure is pretty.

15:56.710 --> 15:59.042
- We do good work.
- A Dallas delivery?

15:59.079 --> 16:01.013
- A rich oilman?
- Banker.

16:01.048 --> 16:05.041
I don't like them bankers,
but I'll deliver her anyway.

16:05.085 --> 16:09.112
- You ever fly one of these Mustangs?
- You start her, I'll fly her.

16:10.724 --> 16:15.718
- How many hours you got on recips?
- Ten, maybe 12,000, Peter.

16:17.164 --> 16:18.153
And jets?

16:19.366 --> 16:22.494
I don't know. Another ten, maybe. Why?

16:22.536 --> 16:26.597
Because I wanna know
how anyone with over 20,000 hours

16:26.640 --> 16:29.973
can run out of gas
and land in a swimming pool.

16:30.010 --> 16:32.274
It wasn't a swimming pool, it was...

16:33.380 --> 16:36.042
- It was a tidal pool.
- Is that a fact?

16:37.218 --> 16:41.052
And to tell you the truth, Peter...
I'm damned if I know.

16:41.088 --> 16:45.889
I do. According to Nick,
you took off despite heavy headwinds.

16:45.926 --> 16:49.191
- I love you too, Nick.
- I was just answering Mr. Gallagher.

16:49.230 --> 16:53.257
The FAA was estimating 30-knot headwinds
over most of his route.

16:53.300 --> 16:58.260
- Hunter should've waited. I would have.
- Shoot, you'd have waited for a tailwind.

16:58.806 --> 17:02.640
- You don't get a tailwind to Hawaii.
- I know.

17:04.078 --> 17:05.067
Knock it off.

17:09.450 --> 17:14.183
Mr. Gallagher wants to know
why 9-4 Delta is in the beautiful blue Pacific

17:14.221 --> 17:17.054
instead of on the apron of the Honolulu Airport.

17:19.159 --> 17:22.219
Probably cos I ran out of gas before I got there.

17:22.262 --> 17:23.820
Still a wisecracker.

17:23.864 --> 17:27.527
You can call me a redneck,
but not a cracker, Gargoyle.

17:27.568 --> 17:29.399
I'm from Texas, not Georgia.

17:30.170 --> 17:34.266
Excuse us for a minute.
Damn it, Hunter, listen to me.

17:34.308 --> 17:38.972
You're wising off with a FAA inspector
who could easily pull your ticket.

17:39.013 --> 17:43.177
I don't care if you never fly again,
but if he gives me an unfavorable report,

17:43.217 --> 17:46.880
my insurance is gonna go higher
than my blood pressure!

17:46.920 --> 17:50.583
I filed a report over the phone in Honolulu
and he's got it.

17:50.624 --> 17:55.254
That clown's been on my six since Nam.
I didn't take it then and I won't take it now!

17:55.296 --> 17:58.288
You'll take it cos I'm telling you to take it.

17:58.332 --> 18:01.495
Either that
or find yourself another outfit to fly for.

18:04.538 --> 18:05.527
OK?

18:08.142 --> 18:10.838
- If you weren't my old CO...
- Yeah, I know.

18:10.878 --> 18:14.314
You'd have taken a poke at me
a long time ago.

18:14.348 --> 18:19.183
I thank my lucky stars every night
that you never did. Wouldn't wanna hurt you.

18:19.219 --> 18:24.384
All right, Mr. Gallagher, Mr. Hunter's ready
to answer all your questions.

18:24.425 --> 18:28.122
When did you know you hadn't enough fuel
to make your destination?

18:28.162 --> 18:30.630
Well, I was a couple of hours out.

18:30.664 --> 18:35.465
I got this funny feeling so I ran her
leaner than usual to be on the safe side.

18:35.502 --> 18:39.734
See, I don't now how much fuel I'm burning
until the temp tanks run dry.

18:40.407 --> 18:44.639
They're supposed to last 12 hours.
They tapped out at ten.

18:44.678 --> 18:49.843
So I leaned her out till she squeaked,
got lucky with a little wind and made it.

18:51.752 --> 18:54.016
- Almost.
- You really are something.

18:54.054 --> 18:57.512
You lose an $80,000 aircraft
because of incompetence

18:57.558 --> 18:59.890
and make it sound like you deserve a medal.

18:59.927 --> 19:03.829
You keep that up, I'm gonna see
if I can't kick you back to Hawaii.

19:03.864 --> 19:07.322
Nick, that Lear has to be delivered soon.
Better get back on it.

19:07.368 --> 19:09.529
Yes, sir, Mr. Jordan, it'll get done.

19:09.570 --> 19:14.166
I just wanna make sure that this guy
doesn't blame going down on my work.

19:17.611 --> 19:19.602
You gonna blame it on Nick?

19:22.316 --> 19:27.481
I wish I could. No, I ran that bird so lean
that the cylinder head temp was on red.

19:27.521 --> 19:32.515
- Never missed a beat.
- Then one way or another, it was pilot error.

19:33.560 --> 19:37.052
- You putting that in your report?
- You'll know when you read it.

19:37.097 --> 19:40.931
I want you in the office this afternoon
to fill out an accident report.

19:40.968 --> 19:42.401
I gotta be in Waco tonight.

19:43.937 --> 19:49.967
- Gallagher, it's my son's birthday.
- That's your problem. This afternoon.

19:50.010 --> 19:56.574
Gallagher, the FAA gives a pilot ten days
to file an accident report - isn't that right?

20:00.320 --> 20:03.312
I think I got you this time, Hunter.

20:03.357 --> 20:06.724
A couple of days one way or the other
doesn't matter to me.

20:07.795 --> 20:10.161
Just a minute, pardner.

20:10.197 --> 20:12.529
I still need a ride to Waco.

20:12.566 --> 20:15.296
You ever hear of commercial airlines?

20:15.335 --> 20:19.328
Where you pay to ride on an airplane
with somebody else driving?

20:19.373 --> 20:22.774
- It is a novel idea.
- No, no, never catch on.

20:22.810 --> 20:25.074
Listen, pardner, want me to saddle up?

20:51.071 --> 20:53.062
That's terrific, Higgins.

20:54.975 --> 20:57.341
I was just clearing my throat.

20:57.377 --> 21:01.279
- Funny, cos it sounded just like a SPAD.
- Sopwith Camel.

21:01.315 --> 21:03.647
- With 30-calibre machine guns.
- 7.7 mm.

21:03.684 --> 21:06.812
- Flown by Captain Eddie Rickenbacker!
- Major Billy Bishop.

21:06.854 --> 21:09.118
And you were there!

21:10.023 --> 21:11.991
Magnum, what do you want?

21:12.392 --> 21:18.228
I just dropped by to tell you that T.C. will
lift the airplane out of the pool in the morning.

21:18.265 --> 21:21.632
Wonderful. Now you've informed me,
why don't you go back to...

21:24.571 --> 21:27.472
Come on, guys, let him finish ordering me out!

21:32.246 --> 21:33.907
It's not you.

21:35.249 --> 21:37.308
There's someone on the estate.

21:42.756 --> 21:46.351
All right, lads. Magnum, do something.

21:47.594 --> 21:50.995
It's just a couple of kids ripping off a souvenir.

21:51.031 --> 21:54.467
- You're responsible for estate security.
- I am?

21:54.501 --> 21:57.493
As far as I'm concerned,
that's international waters.

21:57.538 --> 22:00.268
Very well, I'll handle it myself.

22:00.307 --> 22:04.607
Ahoy there! You're on private property
and you're trespassing!

22:06.580 --> 22:08.411
Oh, good, Higgins.

22:09.616 --> 22:12.608
You terrified a couple of kids. You satisfied?

22:39.845 --> 22:42.177
- Is this what they were after?
- I think so.

22:42.214 --> 22:45.650
There were at least four of these
hidden in each seat.

22:45.684 --> 22:48.152
What is it? Gold? Platinum? Silver?

22:50.255 --> 22:52.189
- Lead.
- What?

22:53.191 --> 22:58.026
An ordinary bar of lead. The type used
by plumbers, electricians, newspapers.

22:58.063 --> 23:01.396
Why would anyone hide lead bars
in airplane seats?

23:01.433 --> 23:03.424
That's gotta weigh a ton.

23:06.304 --> 23:09.796
Someone didn't want that plane
or Mr. Hunter to reach Hawaii.

23:13.245 --> 23:15.179
That's Camelot

23:15.213 --> 23:19.912
and over there, that's the drawbridge.

23:19.951 --> 23:26.186
And over there, that's the tower, yeah,
where Arthur and Guinevere live.

23:26.224 --> 23:32.652
And over there is the Lady of the Lake
in that long white gown.

23:33.398 --> 23:35.958
Buckshot, you listening to me?

23:36.001 --> 23:39.198
What do you know?
You're just an old hound dog.

23:39.237 --> 23:43.936
But if you were smart,
you'd look up there and see... rabbits!

23:45.444 --> 23:47.105
And squirrels!

23:48.480 --> 23:51.278
I bet there's even a cat or two hiding up there.

23:54.119 --> 23:56.280
He made it! He made it!

25:17.002 --> 25:19.937
Sam Houston Hunter,
you scared those cows sour!

25:19.971 --> 25:22.201
Yes, ma'am. Won't happen again.

25:23.008 --> 25:28.640
- You say that every time you come here.
- Is that any way to treat your favorite son?

25:28.680 --> 25:30.341
- Oh!
- Oooh!

25:31.883 --> 25:34.477
You are my only son and thank God.

25:34.519 --> 25:38.683
Don't know if I'd have survived
more'n one of you!

25:38.723 --> 25:41.886
- I got your lunch waiting.
- How d'you know I'd be here?

25:41.927 --> 25:43.918
Kip's birthday, isn't it? Come on.

25:43.962 --> 25:45.395
Pa! Pa!

25:51.269 --> 25:53.760
How ya doin'? Oh, boy!

25:55.106 --> 26:00.271
I knew you'd come! I told Mom. She said
not to count on it, but I knew you'd come.

26:00.312 --> 26:02.780
Well, I always have. Always will.

26:03.648 --> 26:05.980
Say... you been growing?

26:06.518 --> 26:09.351
Almost as tall as Tommy Lee Kahan.

26:09.387 --> 26:12.049
Tommy Lee Kahan? He's a midget.

26:13.525 --> 26:19.225
Go on inside. We'll see how much you've
sprouted in the last three months. Go on.

26:19.264 --> 26:23.860
Samuel, the boy can't help it
if he's not gonna be a mule like you.

26:23.902 --> 26:27.565
All he's gotta do to grow
is want to bad enough.

26:28.573 --> 26:30.564
You sound just like your pa.

26:30.609 --> 26:34.773
All Waco knows he was crazy as a bedbug
till the day he died.

26:34.813 --> 26:37.304
Why did you stay married to him for 43 years?

26:37.349 --> 26:39.340
Because I loved him.

26:40.018 --> 26:43.385
But he was still crazy as a bedbug.

26:48.526 --> 26:54.658
You know, if we counted all this hair,
you'd be a regular Goliath. Just look.

26:56.935 --> 27:01.531
Well, I'll be. Do you know, you've grown
a half-inch in the last three months.

27:02.774 --> 27:05.368
- Now what do you think, huh?
- Soup's ready.

27:05.410 --> 27:09.403
See, son? If you want something bad enough,
it'll happen.

27:09.447 --> 27:10.709
Yes, Pa.

27:10.749 --> 27:14.742
Course, your grandma's cooking
has something to do with it.

27:14.786 --> 27:18.222
- How long you staying?
- Just overnight, Ma.

27:18.256 --> 27:21.748
Gotta deliver that duster
to San Antone tomorrow.

27:26.831 --> 27:28.822
What do you want for your birthday?

27:28.867 --> 27:32.530
- Teach me how to fly!
- You know the promise I made your mother.

27:33.705 --> 27:35.832
I won't ever be 16!

27:37.042 --> 27:41.536
Till you are, you'll just have to make do
with what's out in the duster.

27:47.552 --> 27:51.579
- He wants to fly near as bad as I did.
- Could be.

27:51.623 --> 27:56.617
Or maybe he figures, if you teach him,
you'll have to stick around a while.

28:04.135 --> 28:07.366
It's not a matter of trust,
Jenny, it's business.

28:07.405 --> 28:11.398
Lee, you and I have known Billie Joe
since we were pups.

28:11.443 --> 28:15.846
It's been a bad year for everyone.
All Billy Joe needs is a little more time.

28:15.880 --> 28:18.212
Jenny, I run a bank, not a charity.

28:18.249 --> 28:20.513
You don't run it, your daddy does.

28:20.552 --> 28:22.543
I'm the Senior Loan Officer.

28:25.356 --> 28:27.688
Jenny, come on, wait a minute.

28:29.094 --> 28:31.085
Jenny, you're not being fair.

28:31.129 --> 28:35.190
Tell that to Billie Joe when he loses his farm.

28:40.338 --> 28:42.169
- Shut it off.
- Hi, Jen.

28:42.207 --> 28:45.005
- Shut it off.
- What?

28:45.043 --> 28:48.137
Shut that engine... off.

28:48.179 --> 28:50.773
Did you hear that? It's a real jet.

28:50.815 --> 28:53.648
Does a scale speed of 150 knots.

28:53.685 --> 28:56.085
- Not in the kitchen.
- How ya doin', Lee?

28:56.121 --> 28:58.521
Still foreclosing on your friends?

28:58.556 --> 29:01.389
I asked you to tell me
when you're gonna be home.

29:01.426 --> 29:04.418
- It's Kip's birthday. You knew I'd be here.
- No, I didn't.

29:04.462 --> 29:07.795
- How come you wore my favorite dress?
- Where's your grandma?

29:07.832 --> 29:10.460
She went to Aunt Ida's to pick up my cake.

29:10.502 --> 29:12.868
Probably couldn't stand the noise.

29:13.872 --> 29:18.138
- Honey, Lee brought you a present.
- Gee, thanks, Mr. Childress.

29:18.176 --> 29:20.167
I hope you like it, Kip.

29:21.179 --> 29:24.842
Looking good, Jen.
Prettiest girl in Hondo, Texas.

29:26.217 --> 29:28.617
Always was, always will be.

29:28.653 --> 29:34.023
Course, Betty Sue Swacker doesn't count.
She moved here from San Antone.

29:36.261 --> 29:38.627
Gee, thanks, Mr. Childress.

29:38.663 --> 29:40.654
It's really quite educational.

29:40.698 --> 29:45.362
You buy and sell real estate,
invest in stocks, make loans...

29:45.403 --> 29:48.964
- Foreclose on farms.
- Damn it, Sam, that's enough!

29:50.375 --> 29:53.071
- What did I say?
- Lee, have a cup of coffee,

29:53.111 --> 29:55.705
- and show Kip how it's played.
- Ma!

29:55.747 --> 29:59.205
Sam and I need to have a little talk.

29:59.250 --> 30:02.083
- Jenny...
- Lee, play the game.

30:10.061 --> 30:14.691
Now, of course,
you understand bonds and debentures.

30:18.369 --> 30:21.202
- I won't have it anymore, Sam!
- Won't have what?

30:21.239 --> 30:26.233
You dropping in any time you feel like it,
disrupting my life, insulting my friends!

30:26.277 --> 30:29.872
- Lee? For God's sake, Jen, he's a wimp!
- Stop calling me Jen.

30:30.982 --> 30:35.214
I've been calling you Jen
since we were six and played doctor.

30:35.253 --> 30:38.188
We never did any such thing.

30:38.223 --> 30:45.095
It was Easter Sunday, 1954. Your folks came
over to my folks' house to see our new TV,

30:45.126 --> 30:49.392
and then you and I went out
behind the hayrack, if you remember...

31:00.178 --> 31:02.169
I think you slapped me then, too.

31:09.787 --> 31:12.278
I miss the way you make me laugh.

31:12.323 --> 31:14.814
- You don't have to.
- Yes, I do.

31:16.027 --> 31:18.359
I'm 33 and I have a ten-year-old son.

31:18.396 --> 31:21.729
I don't wanna live outta sleeping bags,
crawl through jungles

31:21.766 --> 31:25.930
or spend my nights freezing
in some open cockpit over the Andes.

31:25.970 --> 31:29.371
- Kinda sounds like fun.
- To you, not to me.

31:29.407 --> 31:34.003
I want a house of my own,
a dinner out once in a while,

31:34.045 --> 31:38.414
for Kip to know there's more to life
than airplanes and legends.

31:38.449 --> 31:43.443
But mostly I want a husband who's there,
not just on birthdays or when I have a baby,

31:43.488 --> 31:47.083
- but every night.
- Sounds like Lee Childress.

31:48.126 --> 31:50.924
- I guess it does.
- Why haven't you married him?

31:51.696 --> 31:56.395
It didn't seem right.
We've only been divorced a little over a year.

31:56.434 --> 31:58.425
One year...

31:59.437 --> 32:01.428
ten months...

32:02.373 --> 32:03.965
three days.

32:08.947 --> 32:10.676
Mm. Mm.

32:22.226 --> 32:23.887
No, not this time!

32:24.963 --> 32:27.523
- Come on, Jen.
- You gonna stay?

32:27.565 --> 32:31.296
- Get a regular job?
- Where? In Waco?

32:31.336 --> 32:36.103
San Antone, Houston, Dallas - I don't care.
As long as you're home at night.

32:37.342 --> 32:39.833
- I gotta fly.
- I don't!

32:41.012 --> 32:42.809
I can't give up my dreams.

32:48.886 --> 32:51.548
I used to lay out in that pasture...

32:51.589 --> 32:53.853
look up at them clouds,

32:53.891 --> 32:57.224
dream about the wonderful places
I'd read about in books.

32:57.261 --> 33:02.255
Places lost so long ago that most people
don't even believe they ever existed.

33:02.300 --> 33:04.291
They did.

33:05.670 --> 33:09.663
And they're still out there
in some form or another.

33:09.707 --> 33:13.973
- All you gotta do to find them is...
- Want to bad enough.

33:14.012 --> 33:16.606
I know your philosophy, Samuel.

33:18.116 --> 33:23.383
- But it hasn't worked for me or you.
- It's worked for Kip. He's grown a half-inch.

33:23.421 --> 33:29.417
He hasn't grown a hair. He makes me
measure him every Saturday night.

33:29.460 --> 33:33.089
- Stood on his toes. He did that to me once.
- Why would he do that?

33:34.832 --> 33:37.995
For the same reason I wore this damn dress.

33:39.537 --> 33:41.232
He wants to please you.

33:44.342 --> 33:49.041
Only I've been around you a lot longer
and I've learned that pleasing you...

33:50.081 --> 33:51.571
it isn't enough.

34:19.893 --> 34:25.831
* Happy birthday to you,
happy birthday to you

34:25.866 --> 34:29.734
* Happy birthday, dear Kip

34:29.768 --> 34:32.567
* Happy birthday to you *

34:34.774 --> 34:36.366
You gotta make a wish.

34:37.577 --> 34:39.067
I already did.

34:47.654 --> 34:49.143
Hello?

34:49.188 --> 34:51.020
Yes. Who?

34:52.025 --> 34:53.856
Just a minute.

34:53.893 --> 34:56.556
Samuel, it's for you.

34:56.596 --> 35:00.088
Hawaii. Some fella named Magnum.

35:10.177 --> 35:15.012
- Magnum, how the hell did you find me?
- I'm a private investigator, remember.

35:15.048 --> 35:19.178
- I did a little investigating.
- I'll know who to come to if I'm in trouble.

35:19.219 --> 35:24.213
Well, I think you might be. Someone was
snooping around the tidal pool last night.

35:24.257 --> 35:27.693
So I swam out there this morning
and checked out the plane.

35:27.727 --> 35:31.128
The seats were cut open.
There were lead bars inside.

35:31.164 --> 35:34.156
- Lead?
- Yeah, about 300 pounds' worth.

35:34.201 --> 35:37.398
- That's why you didn't make it, isn't it?
- That would do it.

35:37.437 --> 35:41.066
<i>Uh</i>... <i>It's none of my business,</i>
<i>but I did some checking</i>.

35:41.107 --> 35:44.565
This guy, Sato,
that you delivered the plane to,

35:44.611 --> 35:49.480
he's a big investor in the islands,
land, condos... cocaine.

35:49.516 --> 35:52.007
<i>That give you any answers?</i>

35:54.020 --> 35:56.181
Some... possibilities.

35:58.558 --> 36:00.958
Magnum, why did you even bother?

36:01.828 --> 36:05.992
I don't know. This may sound stupid,
but for some reason,

36:06.032 --> 36:09.024
this little voice inside keeps whispering
I owe you one.

36:09.903 --> 36:13.066
I think that voice has got it backwards.
I sure do thank you.

36:13.106 --> 36:15.438
- Take care, Hunter.
- You too.

36:21.815 --> 36:27.651
I... gotta deliver the duster tonight
to catch a flight back to LA.

36:28.488 --> 36:32.288
There's this jet
they want me to ferry to Honolulu.

36:33.226 --> 36:37.629
It's a good bonus
if I get it there by... tomorrow night.

36:38.999 --> 36:41.695
When I get back,
I'll teach you how to fly that jet.

36:43.637 --> 36:44.661
What do you say?

36:45.839 --> 36:47.636
Sounds great, Pa.

37:03.723 --> 37:06.214
I've been doing some thinking

37:06.259 --> 37:09.660
and a half-inch in three months
is pretty fast growing.

37:10.664 --> 37:15.260
You get to being too tall
and there's a lot of cockpits you won't fit in.

37:15.302 --> 37:17.133
Maybe you oughta...

37:17.170 --> 37:21.436
Well, just sorta...
hold what you got, you know.

37:23.710 --> 37:27.202
- Don't overdo the growing bit.
- OK, Pa.

37:36.423 --> 37:38.414
- Ma.
- Fly good.

37:48.034 --> 37:50.867
- Maybe next time, Jen.
- Maybe.

38:42.655 --> 38:43.644
Hey, Nick.

38:45.558 --> 38:49.324
Nick, this is Mr. Sato.
He looked over the 9-4 Delta wreckage.

38:49.362 --> 38:52.024
Wants a different interior on the replacement.

38:52.065 --> 38:54.590
I really didn't care for the seats.

38:55.435 --> 39:00.771
Nick's delivering that Lear to New York, but
he can find a few minutes to talk upholstery.

39:01.474 --> 39:05.467
- Yes, sir, of course.
- Good. Mr. Sato, I'll be in my office.

39:05.512 --> 39:08.777
When you're done,
I'd like to take you to lunch. Sushi?

39:08.815 --> 39:11.147
That would be most unique.

39:11.184 --> 39:12.845
Terrific.

39:24.964 --> 39:29.458
I had two big orders.
Yours and another customer in New York.

39:29.502 --> 39:33.165
But I only had enough merchandise
to fill one order.

39:38.178 --> 39:42.342
I figured that, if your plane
was in the bottom of the Pacific Ocean,

39:42.382 --> 39:44.714
who's gonna check it out?

39:49.289 --> 39:51.655
Mr. Sato...

39:51.691 --> 39:53.022
I'm sorry.

39:54.027 --> 39:59.431
Actually,
you show remarkable initiative and ingenuity.

40:00.433 --> 40:04.836
Only my plane didn't quite go down
to the bottom of the ocean.

40:05.538 --> 40:08.996
Yes, sir.
I still don't know how that cowboy made it.

40:09.042 --> 40:14.378
The point, Nick, is, he did what he did.
You did what you did.

40:15.615 --> 40:21.349
All that remains...
is for me to decide what I should do.

40:23.857 --> 40:26.485
- Any suggestions?
- Yes, sir.

40:26.526 --> 40:30.223
Why don't I deliver my merchandise
to Hawaii instead of New York?

40:31.598 --> 40:33.566
An excellent suggestion.

40:36.536 --> 40:38.128
I like it very much, Nick.

40:52.685 --> 40:55.848
Found her rusting in a barn in Grinnell, Iowa.

40:55.889 --> 40:58.357
Took us a year to rebuild her.

41:04.731 --> 41:06.392
Hold on, I'll be right back.

41:07.233 --> 41:09.463
Hunter! Hunter!

41:10.203 --> 41:14.537
Hunter! Hunter, don't you tell me
you augured in that Stearman.

41:14.574 --> 41:18.567
- Where's Nick?
- He just took off for New York in the Lear.

41:18.611 --> 41:21.045
- Damn!
- Damn? Damn what?

41:21.080 --> 41:24.413
They found a couple hundred pounds of lead
hidden in 9-4 Delta.

41:24.450 --> 41:28.887
- Nick was the only guy to work on it.
- Come on, he wouldn't do that.

41:28.922 --> 41:33.518
Yeah, well, our Hawaiian customer,
Mr. Sato - big importer - cocaine.

41:33.560 --> 41:38.827
Sato just took off with Nick. Said he wanted
a demonstration. Hey, where you going?

41:38.865 --> 41:40.856
- Going after it.
- Are you nuts?

41:40.900 --> 41:44.392
I'll call Gargoyle.
He'll have the feds meet 'em in New York.

41:44.437 --> 41:49.841
5 to 1 he's not going to New York.
If Sato is with him, they're headed for Hawaii.

41:49.876 --> 41:51.810
So Gargoyle'll have 'em picked up there.

41:51.844 --> 41:55.211
He could land on a dozen strips in the islands.

41:55.248 --> 41:59.742
Besides, that ol' boy coulda killed me
and I don't cotton to that.

41:59.786 --> 42:00.775
Clear!

42:05.258 --> 42:07.351
How the hell do you start this thing?

42:10.830 --> 42:14.095
<i>4-4 Foxtrot, I understand
you wish to reroute to Hawaii.</i>

42:14.133 --> 42:16.124
<i>- Affirmative.
- Stand by one.</i>

42:16.169 --> 42:20.833
4-4 Foxtrot. No problem.
They'll clear us in a minute.

42:21.541 --> 42:25.102
- Where is the merchandise?
- Last seat on the right.

42:29.649 --> 42:32.482
<i>6-4 Charlie Lima,
you are cleared for takeoff.</i>

42:32.518 --> 42:35.681
<i>Altimeter 30.01, winds 10 at 220</i>.

42:35.722 --> 42:38.190
6-4 Charlie Lima rolling.

42:45.131 --> 42:48.225
4-4 Foxtrot,
you are cleared to flight level 420

42:48.267 --> 42:50.792
on a heading of 270,

42:50.837 --> 42:53.738
Squawk 0223 and ident.

42:53.773 --> 42:55.172
4-4 Foxtrot.

42:55.942 --> 42:58.570
Like I said, no problem.

43:00.613 --> 43:02.205
Let us hope so.

43:08.688 --> 43:14.354
LA Control, this is 6-4 Charlie Lima. Did you
reroute a Lear from New York to Hawaii?

43:14.394 --> 43:18.524
Roger. We have a Lear, 4-4 Foxtrot,
at flight level 420

43:18.564 --> 43:21.158
on a 270 routing.

43:21.200 --> 43:24.033
- 6-4 Charlie Lima requesting the same.
- <i>Roger</i>.

43:29.776 --> 43:31.107
How long will it take us?

43:32.779 --> 43:35.680
Six hours, give or take a few minutes.

43:37.083 --> 43:40.780
There's a bar in the back.
Why don't you get a drink and relax?

43:47.393 --> 43:50.055
- What was that?
- A cowboy.

43:51.064 --> 43:54.056
Don't worry. He doesn't have enough speed
to stay with us.

44:15.188 --> 44:19.420
- What's happening?
- We turned too tight. Compressor stall.

44:19.459 --> 44:21.620
- What's that?
- Our engine blew out!

44:51.524 --> 44:54.550
- Who's got 4-4 Foxtrot?
- Here.

44:54.594 --> 44:58.086
- Did he request a routing change?
- Yes, from New York to Hawaii.

44:58.131 --> 45:02.090
Another aircraft, 6-4 Charlie Lima,
asked for the same thing.

45:02.668 --> 45:05.296
- What's going on?
- Put 'em on the speaker.

45:06.005 --> 45:10.942
- <i>6-4 Charlie Lima, this is LA Control</i>.
- Gargoyle, is that you?

45:11.744 --> 45:17.114
6-4 Charlie Lima, I got a call from Mar-Air
informing me of possible narcotics smuggling

45:17.150 --> 45:19.141
on 4-4 Foxtrot.

45:19.185 --> 45:21.483
<i>We will handle it</i>.

45:21.521 --> 45:24.718
I'm just gonna give y'all a little hand, that's all.

45:25.525 --> 45:28.688
6-4 Charlie Lima, what are your intentions?

45:30.096 --> 45:33.293
<i>I repeat, Hunter, what are your intentions?</i>

45:33.332 --> 45:37.359
I just thought I might encourage this ol' boy
to mosey on back.

45:37.403 --> 45:38.665
How's he gonna do that?

45:40.006 --> 45:43.203
You don't wanna know, son,
you don't wanna know.

45:49.182 --> 45:51.878
- He is crazy!
- I know, I know!

46:25.451 --> 46:31.913
Like I said, Nick, you should've waited
for a tailwind to Hawaii.

46:40.066 --> 46:42.864
Still clearing the throat or catching a cold?

46:42.902 --> 46:46.531
Where have you been?
T.C.'s removing your wreckage this morning.

46:46.572 --> 46:51.305
- My wreckage? It's Hunter's or Sato's.
- Sato's in prison.

46:51.344 --> 46:53.335
Sam called an hour ago to thank you.

46:53.379 --> 46:56.871
He caught Sato and some others
with a planeload of cocaine.

46:56.916 --> 47:00.079
- Gee, that's great.
- I quite agree.

47:00.119 --> 47:04.146
By the by,
did you ever hear of a lost temple of Pele?

47:04.190 --> 47:05.748
No.

47:05.791 --> 47:08.760
Hunter was telling me about it on the phone.

47:08.794 --> 47:12.958
I thought I knew all the local legends,
but I've never heard this one.

47:12.999 --> 47:18.027
It seems there's a stone temple
housing a jade statue of Pele

47:18.070 --> 47:20.061
somewhere on Maui.

47:21.741 --> 47:26.769
Reminds me of the time Alex Clutterbuck
and I were looking for a temple in India.

47:26.812 --> 47:32.614
It was so beastly hot, the only way to travel
was on elephants in a sedan chair.

47:33.419 --> 47:38.686
Anyway, legend had it that there was
a stone temple over a thousand years old

47:38.724 --> 47:43.388
with a statue of what could only be
a Tibetan monkey and a sacred cow

47:43.429 --> 47:46.023
engaged in a most obscene act.

47:46.065 --> 47:49.228
It seems Hunter ran across the legend
while ferrying...

47:49.268 --> 47:51.259
<i>Frodo Leader, this is Hawk Leader</i>.

47:51.304 --> 47:54.171
<i>Know what you boys are holed up in?
A Khmer temple.</i>
