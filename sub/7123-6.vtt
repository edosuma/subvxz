00:32.665 --> 00:36.101
Puppies! Puppies! Puppies!

00:36.169 --> 00:37.898
Hey, Jake.
Hey, Lady.

00:37.971 --> 00:39.632
We came to see
your new pups.

00:39.706 --> 00:40.832
Puppies!

00:41.841 --> 00:44.071
Hey, dudes.
They're still pretty sleepy.

00:44.144 --> 00:46.612
Sleepy little sweeties.

00:46.679 --> 00:49.580
Pups, meet everybody.
- Yes!

00:55.855 --> 00:58.983
And this sweet little lady
is Jake Jr.

00:59.059 --> 01:00.617
Aww!

01:00.693 --> 01:02.627
Oh. That's a butt.

01:05.632 --> 01:07.065
Pre-e-e-e-tty cute.

01:08.568 --> 01:12.902
Finn... I love all my little
babies so much.

01:12.972 --> 01:15.964
I'm not gonna let anything
happen to them.

01:17.310 --> 01:18.334
Dude, real talk...

01:18.411 --> 01:20.572
are you worried about
being a dad?

01:22.182 --> 01:23.774
No way.

01:23.850 --> 01:24.748
Check this out.

01:24.818 --> 01:25.648
Thanks, honey.

01:26.753 --> 01:29.586
It's "Mom's Manual for
Raising Beautiful Children."

01:29.656 --> 01:31.624
Aw, dude... mom!

01:31.691 --> 01:34.683
She would have been so proud
to see you and your pups.

01:37.464 --> 01:39.796
Look! Look!

01:41.301 --> 01:42.632
Aw, BMO!

01:42.702 --> 01:45.034
When's the last time
you washed your controller?

01:45.105 --> 01:46.766
Ugh!

01:46.840 --> 01:48.068
Wh-o-o-o-o-o-oa!

01:55.882 --> 01:58.214
We were just wrestling.
Cool-uncle wrestling.

01:58.284 --> 01:59.911
Uh...

01:59.986 --> 02:01.977
l-l-I think it's getting
kind of late.

02:02.055 --> 02:04.023
Um, puppies need sleep.

02:04.090 --> 02:05.580
Okay.

02:07.060 --> 02:08.425
Uh, Finn...

02:08.495 --> 02:10.156
you should go home.

02:10.229 --> 02:13.324
I'm gonna... live with Lady
and the pups from now on.

02:13.399 --> 02:16.266
I'm a dad now.
It's a pretty big whoop.

02:16.336 --> 02:17.325
Oh.

02:17.403 --> 02:21.362
Psst! Who wants to play
video games?!

02:21.441 --> 02:24.205
Yeah, okay.
I guess we'll take off.

02:24.277 --> 02:25.608
We'll hang out soon.

02:25.678 --> 02:27.509
Aw, no prob, Bob.

02:27.580 --> 02:29.605
Heh. Congrats again.

02:29.682 --> 02:31.809
I'll be right back.

02:31.885 --> 02:34.979
Mwah! Mwah! Mwah! Mwah!

02:35.054 --> 02:38.114
Mwah! Mwah! Mwah!

02:38.191 --> 02:41.558
I'm gonna be
the best dad ever.

02:55.175 --> 02:56.574
Breakfast time.

03:01.114 --> 03:03.309
Sorry, honey.
I'm on guard duty.

03:03.383 --> 03:05.681
You're sleeping for both
of us tonight.

03:22.202 --> 03:24.762
Breakfast ideas for pups.

03:24.837 --> 03:27.931
<i>Recipe for French toast.</i>
<i>Ingredients</i>

03:28.007 --> 03:31.033
<i>Butter, three large eggs,</i>

03:31.110 --> 03:33.544
<i>a wide dash of vanilla, milk,</i>

03:33.613 --> 03:36.104
<i>10 slices of bread</i>
<i>white, brown,</i>

03:36.182 --> 03:39.049
<i>multigrain,</i>
<i>or country loaf.</i>

03:39.118 --> 03:41.951
<i>In a large mixing bowl,</i>
<i>crack the eggs</i>

03:42.021 --> 03:43.716
<i>and whisk the milk,</i>
<i>vanilla, and...</i>

03:43.790 --> 03:44.620
Hmm.

03:44.691 --> 03:46.181
<i>... all eggs and honey.</i>

03:46.259 --> 03:49.319
<i>When your consistency is</i>
<i>satisfactory,</i>

03:49.395 --> 03:50.453
<i>set mixture aside.</i>

03:50.530 --> 03:53.192
<i>Dip bread into mixture</i>
<i>and soak bread thoroughly.</i>

03:53.266 --> 03:56.099
Ha ha!
Kind of like a dead person.

03:56.169 --> 03:58.467
<i>Sauté your eggsoaked bread</i>
<i>slices until</i>

03:58.538 --> 04:01.132
They're just asleep.
It's okay.

04:01.207 --> 04:04.176
You got to be a tough...

04:05.878 --> 04:08.403
...a tough dad.

04:08.481 --> 04:11.006
Aaaaaaaaah!
The puppies aren't moving!

04:11.084 --> 04:13.882
<i>Perform CPR!</i>
<i>They might be dead!</i>

04:22.962 --> 04:26.193
Saved 'em.
Mom's Manual knows best.

04:41.247 --> 04:44.375
You guys are getting big.

04:44.450 --> 04:45.849
Okay.

04:47.754 --> 04:48.982
Excuse me.

04:49.055 --> 04:51.990
Mom's manual suggested
I read you guys a story.

04:52.058 --> 04:53.855
This was your daddy's
favorite book

04:53.926 --> 04:55.723
when he was cute,
like you.

04:55.795 --> 04:56.887
Mm-hmm.

04:56.963 --> 04:59.363
Mm... hmm.

04:59.432 --> 05:01.297
"There once were
five little babies

05:01.367 --> 05:05.098
who were very cute
and very chubby.

05:05.171 --> 05:06.934
One day, they met a fox.

05:07.006 --> 05:08.496
'I'm so hungry

05:08.574 --> 05:10.269
that there must be
something wrong

05:10.343 --> 05:13.403
with my stomach,'
said the baby-eating fox.

05:13.479 --> 05:15.276
'Will one of you babies
be so kind

05:15.348 --> 05:20.047
as to look inside my belly
and see what's wrong? '

05:20.119 --> 05:22.110
'We all will! '
Said the babies,

05:22.188 --> 05:25.351
who were as helpful
as they were chubby."

05:25.425 --> 05:27.325
This is a lot darker
than I remember!

05:27.393 --> 05:29.588
Um... gimme a sec.

05:34.467 --> 05:36.401
Is this appropriate
for babies?

05:36.469 --> 05:39.029
Get that book out of here!

05:39.105 --> 05:41.369
Yeah, okay.

05:41.441 --> 05:44.308
Sorry, sweeties.
Mom's Manual says no.

05:49.315 --> 05:51.943
Take them out
for fresh air, huh?

05:52.018 --> 05:54.851
There... there might be
a giant fox out there.

05:56.589 --> 05:59.023
Or some...
some other predator.

06:00.360 --> 06:02.157
Hey!

06:02.228 --> 06:05.459
This is not for babies!

06:08.067 --> 06:10.331
Hey. Free book.

06:12.338 --> 06:13.862
H-Hey, everybody, look.

06:13.940 --> 06:16.636
Look at this book I found
about eating babies.

06:16.709 --> 06:18.370
Huh?
A book about eating babies?

06:18.444 --> 06:20.844
They just sit there
while you eat them.

06:20.913 --> 06:22.847
Whoa! Eatin' babies.

06:22.915 --> 06:23.973
Wow.

06:24.050 --> 06:26.041
Why haven't we been eating
babies this whole time?

06:27.787 --> 06:31.416
I don't know, but I'm going
to go eat one right now.

06:31.491 --> 06:32.355
Yeah!

06:32.425 --> 06:33.653
Let's eat some babies!

06:35.027 --> 06:39.555
Okay, everyone, your mom
wanted me to take y'all outside.

06:41.100 --> 06:44.558
Unh-unh-unh.
Be careful.

06:45.872 --> 06:47.339
No, Charlie. No!

06:47.407 --> 06:50.069
Too much germs, you know?

06:50.143 --> 06:52.839
Everybody stick
together and don't do anything.

06:53.913 --> 06:55.141
And we can all...

06:55.214 --> 06:57.011
take a... nap.

06:57.083 --> 06:58.710
Then...

07:11.831 --> 07:12.820
Aaaaaaaaaaaah!

07:15.568 --> 07:17.297
Aaaaah!

07:17.370 --> 07:19.600
Oh, my gloob!
No-o-o-o-o!

07:19.672 --> 07:21.503
N-o-o-o-o!!

07:21.574 --> 07:24.543
It's every parent's worst
nightmare!

07:24.610 --> 07:27.101
No! No! No!
Put that down!

07:27.180 --> 07:30.741
Get off of there!
Aah! Come back!

07:32.118 --> 07:34.586
Wait! T. V!
You're gonna hurt yourself!

07:34.654 --> 07:36.383
Charlie, no!

07:36.456 --> 07:37.514
Viola, wait!

07:46.566 --> 07:48.796
Hey, Lady.

07:48.868 --> 07:51.029
These puppies are really
wearing me out, you know?

07:52.138 --> 07:54.902
I can hardly
keep my eyes open.

08:01.347 --> 08:03.838
No, no. It's... it's all
in the manual.

08:03.916 --> 08:05.747
You see, it's...

08:05.818 --> 08:07.115
It's...

08:16.696 --> 08:18.220
Is <i>that</i> a baby?

08:18.297 --> 08:20.094
He doesn't... look right.

08:20.166 --> 08:21.565
Why is he so sweaty?

08:21.634 --> 08:22.601
And hairy?

08:22.668 --> 08:25.535
Look, fellas, there's never
gonna be a perfect baby.

08:25.605 --> 08:28.039
Times like this, you just
gotta dive right in.

08:28.107 --> 08:29.074
Coochie-coochie-coo!

08:35.982 --> 08:36.880
What the...

08:36.948 --> 08:38.883
What are you doing?!
Let me go!

08:42.722 --> 08:44.815
Hold on. Hold on a minute.

08:44.891 --> 08:47.553
Just... just lemme...

08:48.995 --> 08:50.257
Y'all better watch out.

08:53.866 --> 08:54.958
Huh?

08:55.034 --> 08:56.331
Puppies?

08:56.402 --> 08:58.393
What are you doing?!
Go back inside!

08:58.471 --> 09:00.132
The Manual's gonna flip!

09:00.206 --> 09:02.197
Dad, the manual's
a bunch of junk!

09:02.275 --> 09:04.209
Just give us a chance!

09:04.277 --> 09:07.269
Jake Jr., you said your
first words...

09:07.346 --> 09:10.440
"The Manual's
a bunch of junk!"

09:10.516 --> 09:12.848
The Manual's a bunch
of junk?!

09:12.919 --> 09:14.352
Hmm.

09:14.420 --> 09:16.650
<i>Ohh!</i>
<i>Stay back, Jakey.</i>

09:16.722 --> 09:19.316
My Manual says
it's too dangerous.

09:19.392 --> 09:22.452
Mom, your manual's
a bunch of junk!

09:22.528 --> 09:25.019
Look what I can do!
Ha ha!

09:25.097 --> 09:27.565
Oh... dear... glob.

09:31.837 --> 09:34.203
I'm sorry for being such
a little stinker, kids.

09:34.273 --> 09:37.003
Come on and show the old man
what you got.

09:45.718 --> 09:47.015
Whoa! What the...

09:59.932 --> 10:01.923
W-W-W-W-Whoa!

10:05.137 --> 10:07.628
You see, Dad?
We flippin' crushed it.

10:07.707 --> 10:09.004
<i>Crushed</i> it!

10:09.075 --> 10:11.168
You did.

10:11.243 --> 10:13.302
I'm super-proud, y'all.

10:13.379 --> 10:15.108
And I'm duper-sorry, too.

10:15.181 --> 10:17.172
I've been trying to make you
know about safety

10:17.249 --> 10:20.241
without actually learning
about safety the way <i>I</i> did...

10:20.319 --> 10:22.116
by not listening to my mom

10:22.188 --> 10:24.782
when that snake jumped out of
the policeman's boom box.

10:28.494 --> 10:30.985
Yup. I've been trying to make them
know about safety

10:31.063 --> 10:33.657
