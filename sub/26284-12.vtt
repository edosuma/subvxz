WEBVTT

00:03.045 --> 00:05.548
Now, can anyone tell me

00:05.631 --> 00:08.509
why Melville shifts
the narrative voice

00:08.592 --> 00:11.095
from Ishmael to Ahab?

00:18.436 --> 00:20.104
Sheldon.

00:20.187 --> 00:21.188
I have a tummy ache.

00:21.272 --> 00:22.982
I'd like to see the nurse.

00:23.065 --> 00:24.316
A "tummy ache"?

00:24.400 --> 00:27.653
Yes, Derek,
I have a tummy and it aches.

00:27.737 --> 00:29.238
Ergo, tummy ache.

00:29.321 --> 00:31.615
- Ergo?
- It's Latin, Derek.

00:31.699 --> 00:33.242
Go to the nurse.

00:34.326 --> 00:35.870
And to answer your question,

00:35.953 --> 00:37.163
the shifting point of view

00:37.246 --> 00:38.766
grants the reader
a broader perspective

00:38.831 --> 00:41.751
of events than typically allowed
by first-person narration.

00:43.753 --> 00:44.754
Where were we?

00:44.837 --> 00:48.424
And "ergo" is Latin for "hence,"
Derek.

Hello, Nora.

01:10.863 --> 01:14.700
Hey, there's
my favorite patient!

01:14.784 --> 01:16.744
- What hurts today?
- Tummy troubles.

01:16.827 --> 01:18.621
Oh, no. Sorry to hear it.

01:18.704 --> 01:20.581
Let me grab your file.

01:20.664 --> 01:22.666
<i>Throughout
my high school career,</i>

01:22.750 --> 01:24.043
<i>Nurse Nora and I</i>

01:24.126 --> 01:26.378
<i>had been through quite a few
close calls...</i>

01:27.171 --> 01:28.464
This is just a blister.

01:28.547 --> 01:29.590
Are you sure?

01:29.673 --> 01:32.676
Sheldon, I promise
you don't have leprosy.

01:33.719 --> 01:35.763
Ooh, that's bright.

01:35.846 --> 01:38.474
Proving you don't have
hysterical blindness.

01:38.557 --> 01:40.351
Well, can you test
for just hysterical?

01:40.893 --> 01:43.562
Oh. Looks like
you bit your cheek.

01:43.646 --> 01:46.107
How do you know it's not scurvy?

01:46.190 --> 01:47.691
Because you're not a pirate.

01:47.775 --> 01:50.069
So, we've got
a tummy ache?

01:50.152 --> 01:52.822
Yes. I'm afraid
it might be cholera.

01:52.905 --> 01:53.989
Again?

01:54.073 --> 01:55.950
I have one of the symptoms.

01:56.033 --> 01:58.786
Okay, on a scale of one to ten,
what's your pain level?

01:58.869 --> 02:00.746
Three...

02:00.830 --> 02:02.915
point four seven.

02:02.998 --> 02:04.250
That's pretty serious.

02:05.918 --> 02:08.838
But since you're at a 3.47,

02:08.920 --> 02:10.714
I'm gonna give you
the strongest medication

02:10.798 --> 02:12.508
I'm allowed to give you.

02:13.801 --> 02:16.470
You're an angel of mercy,
Nurse Nora.

02:17.304 --> 02:19.515
Ooh, cherry.

02:25.312 --> 02:26.689
Hello?

02:26.772 --> 02:28.649
Oh. Hey, Nora.

02:28.732 --> 02:30.693
What is it this time?

02:32.319 --> 02:34.446
Okay, yeah,
thanks for lettin' me know.

02:34.530 --> 02:36.115
I'll keep an eye on him.

02:37.825 --> 02:39.243
Sheldon back in
the nurse's office?

02:39.326 --> 02:41.328
- Yep.
- Let me guess.

02:41.412 --> 02:43.664
Yellow fever. Dengue fever.

02:44.665 --> 02:46.041
Cat scratch fever.

02:46.584 --> 02:47.626
Cholera.

02:47.710 --> 02:49.879
Ooh! I was gonna say cholera.

02:51.922 --> 02:53.340
A quadrilateral

02:53.424 --> 02:55.217
that can be inscribed
in a circle

02:55.301 --> 02:57.720
is an example
of a cyclic polygon.

02:59.096 --> 03:02.975
Sheldon, don't argue with me,
I'm looking at it right here.

03:03.058 --> 03:05.186
<i>While Nurse Nora's
special medicine</i>

03:05.269 --> 03:07.271
<i>had given me
a temporary reprieve,</i>

03:07.354 --> 03:10.441
<i>my pain had escalated to a 4.9.</i>

03:10.524 --> 03:12.252
<i>Although Ms. Ingram's
questionable math skills</i>

03:12.276 --> 03:13.903
<i>certainly weren't helping.</i>

03:16.197 --> 03:18.574
Sheldon, you okay?

03:22.703 --> 03:24.538
You're gonna be fine.

03:24.622 --> 03:26.790
One good dump
and you'll feel right as rain.

03:26.874 --> 03:29.043
Can you please not call it that?

03:29.126 --> 03:30.169
What, "dump"?

03:30.252 --> 03:31.295
Yes.

03:31.378 --> 03:32.421
You want me to say "poop"?

03:32.504 --> 03:34.840
I want you to stop
talking about it.

03:35.841 --> 03:37.676
- B.M.?
- Dad!

03:39.637 --> 03:41.138
- Where is he?
- He's fine.

03:41.222 --> 03:42.848
He's in the bathroom
workin' it out.

03:43.599 --> 03:46.018
Shelly, you okay in there?

03:46.101 --> 03:47.311
<i>No.</i>

03:47.394 --> 03:48.520
Give it a few more minutes!

03:48.604 --> 03:50.314
Eyes on the prize!

03:50.397 --> 03:52.608
<i>This is not a fecal issue!</i>

03:52.691 --> 03:54.235
I'm coming in.

03:54.318 --> 03:56.153
<i>My tummy really hurts, Mom.</i>

03:56.237 --> 03:57.571
<i>You do feel a bit warm.</i>

03:57.655 --> 03:59.406
<i>Okay, you finish
up in here,</i>

03:59.490 --> 04:01.330
<i>get in bed, and I'll
bring you some ginger ale.</i>

04:01.992 --> 04:02.993
<i>Canada Dry?</i>

04:03.077 --> 04:04.495
- Yes.
<i>- Room temperature?</i>

04:04.578 --> 04:06.789
- Yes.
<i>- Mostly flat?</i>

04:06.872 --> 04:08.415
I'll stir the fizz out
with a spoon.

04:08.499 --> 04:09.541
<i>Thanks, Mom.</i>

04:11.710 --> 04:12.938
Why don't you dote
on me like that?

04:12.962 --> 04:14.964
Because he's my baby.

04:15.047 --> 04:16.714
Well, I could be your baby.

04:16.798 --> 04:18.759
Oh, now I have a stomachache.

04:21.512 --> 04:23.389
How you feelin', baby?

04:23.472 --> 04:26.433
Remember the tuna sandwich
I had at the bus station?

04:26.517 --> 04:27.518
Yeah?

04:27.601 --> 04:28.978
Worse than that.

04:29.061 --> 04:31.814
Oh, honey, I'm sorry.

04:31.897 --> 04:33.941
I'm sure you'll feel
better in the morning.

04:34.024 --> 04:36.944
Hey, Mom, you know how twins
can feel each other's pain?

04:37.027 --> 04:38.612
You're going to
school tomorrow.

04:39.154 --> 04:41.156
I think she's gettin' smarter.

04:45.703 --> 04:48.247
Relax, he's sleeping.

04:48.330 --> 04:50.624
How come when I'm sick
it's no big deal,

04:50.708 --> 04:51.959
but when Sheldon gets sick

04:52.042 --> 04:53.562
you act like
it's the end of the world?

04:54.503 --> 04:56.547
Because he's
a fragile little boy

04:56.630 --> 04:59.049
and you're gettin' to be
a big, strong man.

04:59.133 --> 05:00.342
That's true.

05:00.426 --> 05:02.511
Puberty has done right by me.

05:04.054 --> 05:05.973
Mom? Something's really
wrong with Sheldon.

05:11.061 --> 05:12.646
We need a doctor here!

05:12.730 --> 05:14.606
<i>In that moment,
I was in too much pain</i>

05:14.690 --> 05:17.735
<i>to tell my father,
"I told you so."</i>

05:17.818 --> 05:20.404
<i>But for years after,
I reminded him constantly.</i>

05:26.201 --> 05:27.786
So how's he doing?

05:29.413 --> 05:31.832
Aw, poor little guy.

05:32.499 --> 05:34.960
All right, well,
if there's anything you need,

05:35.044 --> 05:37.046
let me know.

05:37.129 --> 05:38.464
I love you, too.

05:40.382 --> 05:42.885
- Well?
- Your brother's gonna be fine,

05:42.968 --> 05:45.054
but he has to have
his gallbladder removed.

05:45.137 --> 05:46.555
How's he gonna pee?

05:46.638 --> 05:48.432
Not that bladder,
his gallbladder.

05:48.515 --> 05:49.975
What's the gallbladder do?

05:50.059 --> 05:52.353
I guess not much,
if they're takin' it out.

05:52.436 --> 05:54.855
You think he'll bring it home
so we can see it?

05:56.315 --> 05:57.858
I'll ask.

06:05.074 --> 06:06.575
Oh, I feel terrible.

06:07.368 --> 06:09.137
How was I supposed to know
it was his gallbladder?

06:09.161 --> 06:11.663
The doctor says
it's rare in children.

06:12.289 --> 06:14.958
Well, he's always complaining
about some health issue

06:15.042 --> 06:16.502
and it... it's usually nothin'.

06:16.585 --> 06:18.128
I know, George.

06:19.546 --> 06:21.507
- I mean, how many times...
- I'm prayin' here!

06:21.590 --> 06:23.592
Right, sorry. Sorry.

06:28.972 --> 06:31.725
So, those pain meds should
already be kicking in.

06:31.809 --> 06:32.810
Then my buddy Gary here

06:32.893 --> 06:35.396
is gonna administer the gas,
which'll help you sleep.

06:35.479 --> 06:37.898
And once you're under,
we'll make a little incision

06:37.981 --> 06:40.609
and snatch that guy
right outta there.

06:40.692 --> 06:42.486
- Any questions?
- Yes.

06:42.569 --> 06:44.279
What kind of doctor says,

06:44.363 --> 06:46.615
"Snatch that guy
right out of there?"

06:46.698 --> 06:48.242
Just trying to put you at ease.

06:48.325 --> 06:49.660
It didn't work.

06:49.743 --> 06:51.787
Where did you go
to medical school?

06:51.870 --> 06:53.288
University of Nebraska.

06:53.372 --> 06:54.873
Uh-oh.

06:54.957 --> 06:57.501
Did you at least graduate
with honors?

06:57.584 --> 06:58.584
Top of my class.

06:58.627 --> 07:00.254
Have you had any alcohol

07:00.337 --> 07:02.423
in the last 24 hours?

07:02.506 --> 07:03.549
Not a drop.

07:03.632 --> 07:05.342
How much sleep
did you get last...

07:05.426 --> 07:07.219
- Gary, can we...?
- Got it.

07:08.095 --> 07:11.849
Just relax and start counting
backwards from 100.

07:11.932 --> 07:13.100
Wait, Gary...

07:13.183 --> 07:16.061
Where did you study
anesthesiolo...

07:21.024 --> 07:22.526
Hard to port!

07:22.609 --> 07:24.736
Aye aye, Captain Ahab.

07:29.116 --> 07:30.534
Thar she blows!

07:30.617 --> 07:32.619
Gallbladder dead ahead!

07:35.747 --> 07:37.708
Captain Ahab,
are you hungry?

07:37.791 --> 07:39.126
Do you want
a bowl of gruel?

07:39.209 --> 07:43.255
Not now, Mom, I'm in pursuit
of my inner demons.

07:43.338 --> 07:46.049
Aye, she's a
formidable organ.

07:46.133 --> 07:47.801
Just looks like a whale.

07:47.885 --> 07:49.845
It's a metaphor, doofus.

07:50.888 --> 07:51.930
Arrr!

07:53.515 --> 07:55.476
Sweet dreams, honey.

07:55.559 --> 07:57.227
I'll try.

07:57.311 --> 07:59.605
Your brother's gonna be
just fine.

07:59.688 --> 08:02.149
Yeah, I know.

08:02.232 --> 08:03.650
I'll tell you what.

08:03.734 --> 08:08.280
If I hear any news,
I will come and wake you up.

08:08.822 --> 08:10.157
Thank you.

08:13.494 --> 08:15.245
Night night.

08:45.943 --> 08:47.152
This is ridiculous.

08:47.819 --> 08:50.447
They said an hour and a half.
It's been almost two.

08:50.989 --> 08:52.199
I'm gonna go yell at somebody.

08:52.282 --> 08:53.867
Good. Yell at everybody.

08:53.951 --> 08:56.828
Uh... hey,
y'all can exhale.

08:56.912 --> 08:58.080
Surgery went great.

08:58.163 --> 08:59.498
Thank you, Jesus.

08:59.581 --> 09:01.625
Sheldon's gonna need
to stay here three, four days,

09:01.708 --> 09:02.876
which is standard,

09:02.960 --> 09:04.560
but, uh, after that
he's good to go home.

09:05.379 --> 09:07.130
- Really appreciate it, Doctor.
- Oh.

09:07.214 --> 09:09.550
We can't thank you enough
for takin' care of him.

09:09.633 --> 09:11.635
He's extremely intelligent,
isn't he?

09:11.718 --> 09:14.012
- Oh, yeah.
- He's our special little boy.

09:16.848 --> 09:19.184
Oh.

09:20.727 --> 09:22.020
Are you ready
to see your family?

09:22.104 --> 09:23.313
Yes.

09:23.397 --> 09:25.232
That's good, 'cause
they're ready to see you.

09:25.315 --> 09:26.400
Okay.

09:26.483 --> 09:28.652
There he is. There's my baby.

09:28.735 --> 09:30.571
Hey, buddy.
How you feeling?

09:30.654 --> 09:32.197
I brought you
some comic books.

09:32.281 --> 09:35.242
- Hi, Moonpie.
- Hi, Meemaw.

09:35.325 --> 09:36.325
Where's your gallbladder?

09:36.368 --> 09:37.411
I want to see it.

09:37.494 --> 09:38.954
They throw it away, honey.

09:39.037 --> 09:40.497
- Why?
- Aw.

09:40.581 --> 09:42.207
Can I go home now?

09:42.291 --> 09:44.751
No, baby, they need
to keep you here

09:44.835 --> 09:46.670
a little while,
make sure you're okay.

09:46.753 --> 09:48.505
Overnight?

09:48.589 --> 09:49.631
Actually, a...

09:50.424 --> 09:51.550
few nights.

09:51.633 --> 09:53.802
No. Tell them I'm going home.

09:53.885 --> 09:56.263
Shelly, the doctors know
what's best for you.

09:56.346 --> 09:57.681
What's best for me

09:57.764 --> 10:00.684
is to be at home, in my own bed,
with my books and my computer.

10:00.767 --> 10:03.228
Well, I can bring you whatever
you want. Just... just tell me.

10:03.312 --> 10:05.522
I just told you: bring me home.

10:05.606 --> 10:08.233
Moonpie, you're looking
at this all wrong.

10:08.317 --> 10:12.195
You got your own room here,
your own TV.

10:12.279 --> 10:15.490
Is no one listening to me?
I want to go home.

10:15.574 --> 10:18.243
I'm listening,
but I have no say in this.

10:19.786 --> 10:22.623
<i>No surprise,
despite my adamant protest,</i>

10:22.706 --> 10:24.291
<i>I didn't go home.</i>

10:24.374 --> 10:27.210
<i>Instead, I had to stay
and suffer in silence</i>

10:27.294 --> 10:29.796
<i>like the Southern gentleman
my mother raised me to be.</i>

10:32.424 --> 10:34.551
What's this? I asked for red.

10:34.635 --> 10:36.053
All they had was green.

10:36.136 --> 10:38.722
Well, then you and I have
a problem, don't we?

10:40.265 --> 10:42.142
Ta-da! A dog.

10:42.225 --> 10:43.393
<i>♪♪ I don't give a damn... ♪♪</i>

10:43.477 --> 10:47.022
For God's sake,
it's not a real dog.

10:47.773 --> 10:49.775
Here you go. One O.J.

10:50.776 --> 10:52.819
I see pulp.
No, you don't.

10:52.903 --> 10:54.488
I strained it
with a paper towel.

10:54.571 --> 10:57.157
<i>♪♪ Oh, no... ♪♪</i>

10:57.741 --> 10:59.826
Now all I can taste is towel.

10:59.910 --> 11:02.537
<i>♪♪ Not me... ♪♪</i>

11:02.621 --> 11:04.498
And pulp.

11:04.581 --> 11:06.041
<i>♪♪ Not me ♪♪</i>

11:08.335 --> 11:11.088
Ugh, man, it's Cooper again.

11:11.171 --> 11:12.255
Can you take it?

11:12.339 --> 11:15.759
Do I have to? He asked me if all
the jobs for men were taken.

11:15.842 --> 11:19.680
I'll get it. You just stay here
and do your nails.

11:21.181 --> 11:22.432
What?

11:22.516 --> 11:23.975
Do you know where my mother is?

11:24.059 --> 11:26.645
I think she went down to
the cafeteria. What do you need?

11:26.728 --> 11:27.979
I can't sleep.

11:28.063 --> 11:29.272
Did you try counting sheep?

11:29.356 --> 11:31.525
Oh, no, I'm afraid
of farm animals.

11:31.608 --> 11:34.736
Of course you are. Well, I don't
know what I can do for you.

11:34.820 --> 11:36.697
Do you know
the "Soft Kitty" song?

11:37.239 --> 11:38.281
No.

11:38.365 --> 11:40.325
I'll teach it to you.
Get a notepad.

11:43.787 --> 11:45.247
Okay.

11:45.330 --> 11:47.874
I got your pillow
and your blanket.

11:47.958 --> 11:49.501
Here.

11:51.753 --> 11:54.005
Shelly, what do you say?

11:54.089 --> 11:56.591
Why does it smell like Missy?

11:58.260 --> 12:00.262
You're doing great, honey.

12:04.599 --> 12:05.767
What's going on?

12:05.851 --> 12:08.061
This is Ricky,
your new roommate.

12:09.020 --> 12:10.814
Nice to meet you.

12:13.650 --> 12:15.652
I am so sorry.

12:24.911 --> 12:26.413
It's just for one night.

12:26.496 --> 12:28.248
They said
you're going home tomorrow.

12:28.331 --> 12:30.041
They also said
I'd have my own room.

12:30.125 --> 12:31.918
He better not be contagious.

12:32.002 --> 12:33.879
- He's not.
- Are you sure?

12:33.962 --> 12:35.464
Should we ask his doctor?

12:35.547 --> 12:37.924
You just asked me and I said no.

12:38.008 --> 12:40.719
But you're not a doctor.
Your career stalled at nurse.

12:42.512 --> 12:44.055
Okay, listen.

12:44.139 --> 12:48.810
I done put up with your nonsense
long enough, and it ends now.

12:48.894 --> 12:50.896
That boy is your roommate,

12:50.979 --> 12:54.483
that's the situation and you
gonna make the best of it.

12:54.566 --> 12:55.984
You get my drift?

13:04.242 --> 13:05.827
So Sheldon comes home tomorrow?

13:05.911 --> 13:07.370
Yep.

13:07.913 --> 13:10.457
Everybody's thinking it,
so I'm gonna say it.

13:10.540 --> 13:12.501
This has been a nice break.

13:12.584 --> 13:15.545
Hey. Don't talk about
your brother like that.

13:15.629 --> 13:17.422
Since when are you on his side?

13:17.506 --> 13:19.090
Since Dad almost let him die.

13:22.552 --> 13:25.222
<i>- No!</i>
- Unbelievable.

13:25.305 --> 13:27.599
It's either cartoons
or men in their underwear

13:27.682 --> 13:30.018
banging their heads together.

13:30.101 --> 13:32.103
<i>You complain a lot.</i>

13:33.897 --> 13:35.023
Excuse me?

13:36.441 --> 13:39.277
Seriously, dude,
you need to relax.

13:39.361 --> 13:40.987
How can I relax?

13:41.071 --> 13:43.740
I'm being held captive
in a bacterial playground.

13:44.658 --> 13:45.909
Why are you here?

13:45.992 --> 13:48.703
I had to have my gallbladder removed.
Why are you here?

13:48.787 --> 13:50.372
I'm having surgery tomorrow.

13:51.039 --> 13:52.040
How come?

13:52.123 --> 13:54.000
I was born with a hole
in my heart.

13:54.626 --> 13:57.254
My mom says everyone is born
with a Jesus-shaped hole

13:57.337 --> 13:59.673
in their heart, but I'm guessing
this is different.

14:00.632 --> 14:02.342
Yeah, they're gonna
put a patch on it.

14:02.425 --> 14:04.261
And then it just
stays there forever?

14:04.803 --> 14:07.681
Yeah, like a Band-Aid
you never have to pull off.

14:07.764 --> 14:10.475
That's great, because that's
the worst thing about Band-Aids.

14:11.935 --> 14:13.329
They may have removed
my gallbladder,

14:13.353 --> 14:15.188
but not my wicked sense
of humor.

14:22.445 --> 14:23.446
Whatcha working on?

14:23.530 --> 14:25.115
A welcome home sign for Sheldon.

14:25.198 --> 14:27.617
Well, that's a nice thing.

14:27.701 --> 14:30.120
Yeah, but this "W"
took me half an hour.

14:30.203 --> 14:32.080
Hmm. Do you want some help?

14:32.163 --> 14:33.164
Yeah.

14:33.248 --> 14:36.418
Georgie, get your ass in here!

14:36.501 --> 14:39.170
How did you find out
you have a hole in your heart?

14:39.254 --> 14:40.797
I fainted playing soccer.

14:40.881 --> 14:43.800
- Hmm, I guess I'm fortunate.
- Why?

14:43.884 --> 14:46.136
I don't and never will play soccer.

14:46.219 --> 14:48.805
How did you know something
was wrong with your gallbladder?

14:48.889 --> 14:50.765
It started
as a minor tummy ache,

14:50.849 --> 14:53.310
then escalated
to a major tummy ache.

14:53.393 --> 14:55.020
Luckily, I handle pain well.

14:59.316 --> 15:01.735
What are you gonna
do when you get home?

15:01.818 --> 15:04.613
Enjoy a bathroom
I can relax in.

15:04.696 --> 15:05.947
Although I do like that there's

15:06.031 --> 15:08.283
a big red emergency button
in there.

15:09.034 --> 15:10.702
I actually don't mind it here.

15:11.244 --> 15:12.829
What about the food?

15:12.913 --> 15:16.458
It's not as good as my grandma's
tamales, but nothing is.

15:16.541 --> 15:18.501
How long has she been
taking care of you?

15:18.585 --> 15:20.045
My whole life.

15:20.128 --> 15:22.797
She'd be here,
but she's watching my brother.

15:24.007 --> 15:26.843
My meemaw takes care of us
sometimes, too.

15:27.385 --> 15:30.472
I'm excited for my heart
to be fixed, 'cause then,

15:30.555 --> 15:33.058
she won't have to worry
about me anymore.

15:33.141 --> 15:35.268
But hey, once they put
the patch on my heart,

15:35.352 --> 15:37.395
I'll sort of be like Iron Man.

15:37.938 --> 15:41.024
Technically, Iron Man
has a magnet, not a patch.

15:41.107 --> 15:43.109
And technically,
I said "sort of."

15:43.193 --> 15:44.903
Touché.

15:53.787 --> 15:56.831
Where'd he go? Where's Ricky?

15:56.915 --> 15:58.416
He's in surgery.

15:59.459 --> 16:00.752
Oh.

16:00.835 --> 16:02.379
But look what I'm doing.

16:02.462 --> 16:04.756
I'm packing up so
we can go home.

16:04.839 --> 16:06.216
Can we wait until he's done?

16:06.299 --> 16:08.593
I think it's gonna
be a while, honey,

16:08.677 --> 16:10.345
but why don't we get a move on

16:10.428 --> 16:11.888
and then we can
check on him later?

16:14.724 --> 16:16.393
Okay.

16:20.855 --> 16:22.440
One second.

16:23.316 --> 16:25.485
Excuse me, Nurse Robinson?

16:25.568 --> 16:28.822
- Yes?
- Will you give this Iron Man comic to Ricky?

16:28.905 --> 16:30.615
I'll see that he gets it.

16:30.699 --> 16:33.493
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

16:33.576 --> 16:35.578
And thank you
for taking care of me.

16:35.662 --> 16:37.414
You're welcome.

16:37.497 --> 16:38.915
You stay healthy.

16:38.999 --> 16:40.458
I will.

16:41.543 --> 16:44.004
When did he become nice?

16:54.472 --> 16:57.183
Uh, I'll get the next one.

17:17.746 --> 17:19.539
I actually missed you.

17:20.123 --> 17:21.665
Ain't that nice?

17:21.750 --> 17:24.586
- What about me did you miss?
- I don't know.

17:24.669 --> 17:26.337
Well, think about it
and get back to me.

17:26.421 --> 17:28.798
Ha, he gave you homework.

17:28.882 --> 17:30.735
Sheldon, I just got off
the phone with that nurse

17:30.759 --> 17:32.010
from the hospital.

17:32.093 --> 17:33.887
Your little roommate's
gonna be just fine.

17:33.970 --> 17:35.513
Oh, good. That's a relief.

17:35.597 --> 17:36.973
Would you like to go visit him?

17:37.640 --> 17:39.476
No. Why?

17:41.478 --> 17:43.980
Okay, here we go, Sheldon.

17:44.064 --> 17:49.569
One "precision astronomical
refractor telescope."

17:49.652 --> 17:51.613
Wow. Thanks, Dad.

17:51.696 --> 17:53.948
<i>For the next few
weeks, my guilt-ridden father</i>

17:54.032 --> 17:56.993
<i>continued to lavish me
with gifts.</i>

17:57.077 --> 17:59.746
<i>Then the football playoffs
started and that was that.</i>

17:59.829 --> 18:02.415
Time's up.
What did you miss about me?
