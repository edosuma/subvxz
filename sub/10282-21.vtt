WEBVTT

00:04.805 --> 00:07.041
Previously on ER.

00:07.075 --> 00:07.808
You won't tell me how you feel.

00:07.841 --> 00:09.410
It's fine.
LEWIS:
If you're

00:09.443 --> 00:11.445
having trouble, you should see
a couples therapist, and

00:11.479 --> 00:12.780
if you can't do that,
you should work
separate shifts.

00:12.813 --> 00:14.782
This is our niece, Shelley.

00:14.815 --> 00:17.085
I just found out
they were here.

00:17.118 --> 00:19.653
We're waiting on
Social Services
to come down here.

00:19.687 --> 00:21.089
It was my father's.

00:21.122 --> 00:22.256
I want you to have it.

00:23.691 --> 00:25.159
It suits you.

00:27.661 --> 00:30.298
( heavy machinery
buzzing and whirring )

00:32.000 --> 00:38.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:41.309 --> 00:43.744
Surveying your kingdom?

00:43.777 --> 00:44.845
I was just wondering,

00:44.878 --> 00:46.614
what do they do
with all the dirt?

00:46.647 --> 00:50.151
When's it supposed to open?

00:50.184 --> 00:51.352
A year from

00:51.385 --> 00:53.654
September.

00:53.687 --> 00:56.257
Hey, congratulations,
by the way.

00:56.290 --> 00:57.825
Uh, tenure.

00:57.858 --> 00:59.093
( machines beeping )

00:59.127 --> 01:00.361
Thank you.

01:00.394 --> 01:02.563
But that's not
a good thing?

01:02.596 --> 01:03.764
No, it's good.

01:03.797 --> 01:05.733
It's great.

01:07.801 --> 01:11.705
So, you got about two weeks left
on your internship, huh?

01:11.739 --> 01:13.441
You ready to be an R-2?

01:13.474 --> 01:16.577
Do I have a choice?

01:16.610 --> 01:19.180
I can't believe
it went so fast.

01:19.213 --> 01:20.714
Don't hear many interns
say that.

01:20.748 --> 01:23.451
Hmm.

01:23.484 --> 01:24.685
Who's Joshua?

01:24.718 --> 01:25.886
Family member.

01:25.919 --> 01:28.522
Yes, I got that from
the "Carter" part.

01:31.625 --> 01:33.694
Joshua's what Kem and I
were gonna name the baby.

01:36.930 --> 01:38.866
It's a good
thing you're
doing here, John.

01:41.502 --> 01:43.504
LEWIS:
If Surgery's mad

01:43.537 --> 01:45.306
'cause some guy went up
without a central line,

01:45.339 --> 01:46.807
they call and
scream at you.

01:46.840 --> 01:49.343
If GI is pissed because some
ulcerative colitis went home

01:49.377 --> 01:51.479
without follow-up, who
do they call and yell at?

01:51.512 --> 01:53.314
Me.
!
You got it.

01:53.347 --> 01:55.383
You also have
office hours

01:55.416 --> 01:57.685
for the med students
and residents to stop by

01:57.718 --> 01:59.453
if they have any problems
or questions.

01:59.487 --> 02:00.921
I get an office?

02:00.954 --> 02:02.856
Well, the other chiefs
haven't really used it.

02:02.890 --> 02:04.658
Where is it?

02:04.692 --> 02:07.195
Morris, office hours is just
really a figure of speech.

02:07.228 --> 02:08.795
Just make yourself
available at Admit.

02:08.829 --> 02:10.464
You're the new
head cheerleader.

02:10.497 --> 02:12.866
You organize parties,
bring treats for residents

02:12.900 --> 02:14.535
working holidays,
host happy hours.

02:14.568 --> 02:15.803
Do I get a budget for that?

02:15.836 --> 02:17.705
Yup, it's called
your ATM card.

02:17.738 --> 02:19.673
Next year's
resident contracts--

02:19.707 --> 02:21.709
sign them and have
them in my box

02:21.742 --> 02:23.344
by the end
of the week.

02:23.377 --> 02:24.912
Dr. Barnett, we need
to find some time

02:24.945 --> 02:27.415
to talk about yours, okay?

02:27.448 --> 02:29.350
WOMAN:
So, you two work together?

02:29.383 --> 02:31.385
TAGGART:
Yeah, in the E.R. at County.

02:31.419 --> 02:33.954
I'm a... a nurse.

02:33.987 --> 02:35.489
Luka's a doctor.

02:35.523 --> 02:37.391
Must be challenging.

02:37.425 --> 02:39.460
Can be.

02:39.493 --> 02:41.895
Place is an
insane asylum.

02:41.929 --> 02:44.332
How long have you been together?

02:46.900 --> 02:48.502
About a year
on and off.

02:48.536 --> 02:49.770
Mostly on.

02:49.803 --> 02:51.372
Have you sought therapy before?

02:54.308 --> 02:56.244
No.

02:57.545 --> 02:59.547
So, what brings you to me today?

03:06.754 --> 03:09.257
I-I don't think Luka
and I should be together.

04:04.077 --> 04:05.479
Oh, mama, mama, mama!

04:05.513 --> 04:06.980
Another four of M.S.,
with two of Versed?

04:07.014 --> 04:08.349
Is that a statement
or a question?

04:08.382 --> 04:09.417
Four of MS and
two of Versed.

04:09.450 --> 04:10.818
You want Ativan?

04:10.851 --> 04:12.720
Oh God, it hurts!
RASGOTRA:
No. It has too long

04:12.753 --> 04:14.021
a half-life
for pre-op assessments.

04:14.054 --> 04:17.591
( man crying )
Calm down, sir.

04:17.625 --> 04:19.392
What is all the ruckus?

04:19.427 --> 04:21.728
RASGOTRA:
Mr. Lillion was checking
radiator leaks

04:21.762 --> 04:23.030
while his
engine was on.

04:23.063 --> 04:24.732
I caught my hair
in the damn belt.

04:24.765 --> 04:26.033
Yeah, avulsed his whole scalp.

04:26.066 --> 04:27.401
( Lillion crying )

04:27.435 --> 04:28.436
Okay, okay.

04:28.469 --> 04:29.603
Then tried to
pull his hair

04:29.637 --> 04:31.605
out of the moving
fan with his hand.

04:31.639 --> 04:32.940
Ouch.

04:32.973 --> 04:34.442
RASGOTRA:
Open fracture of the third

04:34.475 --> 04:35.443
and fourth metacarpals

04:35.476 --> 04:36.710
and extensor tendon lacs.

04:36.744 --> 04:37.811
You want antibiotics?

04:37.845 --> 04:39.347
A gram of Ancef
I.V. piggyback.

04:39.347 --> 04:40.448
Anything else?

04:40.481 --> 04:42.916
( Lillion crying and coughing )

04:42.950 --> 04:44.785
100 of gentamicin.
Why gent?

04:44.818 --> 04:45.986
( Lillion panting )

04:46.019 --> 04:47.555
CARTER:
Because open fractures

04:47.588 --> 04:48.989
are susceptible
to gram negative organisms.

04:49.022 --> 04:50.891
FRANK:
Hey, Pratt,
some guy

04:50.924 --> 04:52.560
out front says
he's a friend of yours.

04:52.593 --> 04:54.027
What's his complaint?
Nothing
he'll tell

04:54.061 --> 04:56.029
me about. Says he knows you
from high school.

04:56.063 --> 04:57.498
Ugh.
CARTER:
Go ahead, I got this.

04:57.531 --> 04:59.032
( groaning and panting )

04:59.066 --> 05:00.434
Oh, my head.

05:00.468 --> 05:01.735
Ow!

05:04.772 --> 05:05.906
Darnell.

05:05.939 --> 05:07.408
Greg, how you
doing, baby?

05:07.441 --> 05:08.976
What's up, man?
All right.
My boy.

05:09.009 --> 05:10.010
Remember KJ, right?

05:10.043 --> 05:11.445
Yeah. What's up, little man?

05:11.479 --> 05:12.780
Get up and say hello
to Dr. Pratt, man.

05:12.813 --> 05:14.014
Where's the love at?

05:14.047 --> 05:15.783
Yeah, right.
Yeah, you're getting big.

05:15.816 --> 05:17.385
Yeah, tell
me about it.
So, what's up?

05:17.385 --> 05:18.552
Got somewhere
we could talk?

05:18.586 --> 05:19.720
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

05:19.753 --> 05:20.053
All right. Be right back.

05:20.087 --> 05:21.021
I'm happy.

05:21.054 --> 05:23.424
No, you're not.

05:23.457 --> 05:25.125
I'm not.

05:25.158 --> 05:27.027
Well, nobody is
happy all the time.

05:27.060 --> 05:28.128
( sighs )

05:28.161 --> 05:29.663
He's like a sphinx.

05:29.697 --> 05:31.465
I never know what
he's thinking.

05:31.499 --> 05:33.066
We talk.

05:33.100 --> 05:34.034
We don't talk.

05:34.067 --> 05:35.469
I talk.

05:35.503 --> 05:36.837
You sit there
and smile.

05:36.870 --> 05:38.972
Occasionally,
you nod.

05:39.006 --> 05:39.873
( sighs )

05:39.907 --> 05:41.141
And then I get mad.

05:41.174 --> 05:42.910
I am always the one
who's getting angry.

05:42.943 --> 05:44.077
I am always the one
who's yelling.

05:44.111 --> 05:45.779
What, you want me to get angry?

05:45.813 --> 05:46.847
Yeah. That would be nice.

05:46.880 --> 05:48.516
Could you please break a dish,

05:48.549 --> 05:50.918
or-or scream at the top
of your lungs, something?

05:50.951 --> 05:52.586
( sighs )

05:52.620 --> 05:54.422
That's what I'm talking about.

05:56.123 --> 05:58.859
What are you feeling, Luka?

06:04.832 --> 06:06.467
I'm happy.

06:06.500 --> 06:08.168
I'm happy, and Sam's not.
I don't...

06:08.201 --> 06:09.803
I don't know why.

06:09.837 --> 06:11.004
We're healthy,

06:11.038 --> 06:13.073
we-we enjoy each other,
our work.

06:15.208 --> 06:17.445
We have a good life.

06:18.912 --> 06:20.981
WOMAN:
How does that make
you feel, Sam?

06:21.014 --> 06:25.085
Like hitting him
over the head with a... hammer.

06:27.020 --> 06:28.556
WOMAN:
Was there a particular event,

06:28.589 --> 06:31.525
or series of events that led
to your decision

06:31.559 --> 06:32.760
to come here today?

06:32.793 --> 06:34.462
Uh... yeah.

06:34.462 --> 06:36.464
I thought that, uh,
I might be pregnant.

06:36.464 --> 06:37.631
And are you?

06:37.665 --> 06:39.833
No. Thank God.

06:39.867 --> 06:42.836
That's a pretty
unequivocal answer.

06:42.870 --> 06:44.204
Yeah.

06:44.237 --> 06:47.475
That's how I feel about it.

06:49.042 --> 06:51.011
Is that how you feel
about it, Luka?

06:56.149 --> 06:58.552
What is that?

06:58.586 --> 07:00.521
Hey, what the hell is that?!

07:00.554 --> 07:01.989
What's what, Billy?

07:02.022 --> 07:04.057
That, up there,
coming out of
the damn ceiling.

07:04.091 --> 07:06.494
Smells like crap.

07:06.527 --> 07:07.728
It is crap!

07:07.761 --> 07:08.896
Okay.

07:08.929 --> 07:10.598
Bad enough I'm
stuck in here,

07:10.631 --> 07:12.766
you're-you're gonna let
the building crap on me?

07:12.800 --> 07:14.968
I think it's just
your DTs kicking in, Mr. Seiger.

07:15.002 --> 07:16.637
Hey, uh, uh...

07:16.670 --> 07:18.672
unless they're
passing out ponchos,
better get him

07:18.706 --> 07:20.674
back in the ambulance
and over to Mercy pronto!

07:20.708 --> 07:21.909
Jake's in Philadelphia?

07:21.942 --> 07:23.143
Tulane.

07:23.176 --> 07:24.512
I thought he was
in San Francisco?

07:24.512 --> 07:26.079
That was a couple
of weeks ago.

07:26.113 --> 07:28.181
Frank, something
disgusting is leaking
out of the ceiling.

07:28.215 --> 07:29.817
You might want
to call maintenance.

07:29.850 --> 07:30.918
That or a
Hazmat unit.

07:30.951 --> 07:32.119
So, Carter
gets tenure,

07:32.152 --> 07:34.655
and Dr. Lewis doesn't?

07:34.688 --> 07:35.856
Yep.

07:35.889 --> 07:37.157
Well, how do you explain that?

07:37.190 --> 07:38.892
Lewis has more seniority,
she runs the E.R.

07:38.926 --> 07:39.893
Bada-bing.
Show me the green.

07:39.927 --> 07:41.662
Hey, anybody seen Carter?

07:41.695 --> 07:44.632
He's got African love
on the overseas line again.

07:44.665 --> 07:46.166
He took the avulsed scalp.

07:46.199 --> 07:47.601
Sorry, Kem.

07:47.635 --> 07:49.002
Can I take a message?

07:49.036 --> 07:51.839
So, you get tenure based
on how much money you have?

07:51.872 --> 07:53.941
Well, he's building a new
wing for the hospital,

07:53.974 --> 07:55.709
and she's pushing
paper and banana bags.

07:55.743 --> 07:57.177
Highly-qualified woman,
well-liked man.

07:57.210 --> 07:58.879
Who do you think
they're gonna get?

07:58.912 --> 08:01.048
Oh, put your bra back
on, Gloria Steinem.

08:01.081 --> 08:02.550
Carter's been
here ten years,

08:02.583 --> 08:04.084
Lewis split, and
then came back.

08:04.117 --> 08:05.819
Yeah, and it's a level
playing field now.

08:05.853 --> 08:06.820
Haven't you heard?

08:06.854 --> 08:08.889
Uh, Xnay on the Lewisnay.

08:08.922 --> 08:11.191
Dr. Barnett,
do you have a
minute for me?

08:11.224 --> 08:12.793
Sure.

08:13.961 --> 08:16.564
Ooh.

08:16.564 --> 08:18.999
PRATT:
So, what, is he interested
in medicine or something?

08:19.032 --> 08:20.300
No, but he's got

08:20.333 --> 08:22.903
to do his community
service hours somewhere.

08:22.936 --> 08:24.572
What did he get busted for?

08:24.572 --> 08:26.206
Tagging. Had some
weed on him, too.

08:26.239 --> 08:27.575
( sighs )

08:27.608 --> 08:28.776
Hey, we did
a lot worse,

08:28.809 --> 08:29.677
just never
got caught.

08:29.710 --> 08:31.579
Yeah, speak for yourself.

08:31.612 --> 08:33.581
( laughs ):
It ain't my fault
I ran faster.

08:33.614 --> 08:35.082
( laughing )

08:35.115 --> 08:36.616
All right, look,
on the real,

08:36.650 --> 08:38.686
I'm just a hired hand
around here, you know?

08:38.719 --> 08:40.220
It's not really my decision
to make.

08:40.253 --> 08:42.722
But you'll ask?

08:43.823 --> 08:44.992
Yeah, man.

08:45.025 --> 08:46.594
My man. Oh.

08:46.594 --> 08:48.095
I'll ask.
My man,
50 grand.

08:48.128 --> 08:50.230
( laughing )

08:50.263 --> 08:53.033
Because I don't think
it would be fair to Alex.

08:53.066 --> 08:54.234
WOMAN:
Alex is?

08:54.267 --> 08:57.137
My son.

08:57.170 --> 08:59.139
You know, he doesn't have
enough problems already

08:59.172 --> 09:00.340
without feeling like

09:00.373 --> 09:01.308
he's getting elbowed
out by a baby.

09:01.341 --> 09:02.710
I think Alex would like

09:02.743 --> 09:04.244
to have a brother
or a sister, a family.

09:04.277 --> 09:05.245
He has a family.

09:05.278 --> 09:07.247
Hang on, hang on. Time out.

09:07.280 --> 09:09.850
Luka, issues revolving around

09:09.883 --> 09:11.351
having children can be
very complicated

09:11.384 --> 09:12.653
when one person
in the relationship

09:12.686 --> 09:13.754
already has a child.

09:13.787 --> 09:15.122
God, Luka, I didn't even want

09:15.155 --> 09:16.323
to have a kid the first time.

09:16.356 --> 09:19.259
Alex was unplanned?

09:19.292 --> 09:21.061
Yeah, you could say that.

09:21.094 --> 09:22.329
I was 15.

09:22.362 --> 09:24.231
Well, you're not 15 anymore.

09:26.099 --> 09:27.868
After what happened
to your wife and kids,

09:27.901 --> 09:29.302
you really want to
bring another baby

09:29.336 --> 09:31.772
into this world?

09:31.805 --> 09:33.707
You had a family before?

09:36.977 --> 09:39.980
He says he's happy,
and he can't even talk about it.

09:40.013 --> 09:41.281
I had two children and a wife.

09:41.314 --> 09:42.883
They were killed years ago.

09:42.916 --> 09:44.251
I mean, how does it help us--

09:44.284 --> 09:45.953
for me to talk
about these things?

09:45.986 --> 09:47.755
Because that's a huge part
of who you are,

09:47.788 --> 09:50.023
and you won't let me in.

09:50.057 --> 09:52.660
LOCKHART:
How come every kid

09:52.693 --> 09:53.694
named Destiny

09:53.727 --> 09:55.362
Miracle or Faith

09:55.395 --> 09:57.264
ends up with leukemia?

09:58.298 --> 10:00.000
Hmm.

10:00.033 --> 10:02.169
Alkanalize her fluids and
give Oncology a heads up.

10:02.202 --> 10:03.771
That scalp guy
went to the O.R.

10:03.804 --> 10:07.374
Oh, you got another call
from your Kenyan love nest.

10:07.407 --> 10:09.109
It's the
Congo, Frank.

10:09.142 --> 10:11.645
And I know that you
know it's the Congo.

10:11.679 --> 10:13.180
Kenya, Congo.

10:13.213 --> 10:15.348
It's all mosquitoes the size
of flying toasters to me.

10:15.382 --> 10:16.984
She sounded kind of upset.

10:17.017 --> 10:18.652
MAN:
You're all set.

10:18.686 --> 10:20.387
You're just
gonna leave
that bucket

10:20.420 --> 10:22.355
sitting there
in the middle of the floor?

10:22.389 --> 10:24.124
We shut off the
toilet up in the O.R.

10:24.157 --> 10:25.659
Soon as it drains,
we'll snake it.

10:25.693 --> 10:26.994
So, how long are we gonna have
raw sewage

10:27.027 --> 10:28.228
seeping out of our ceiling?

10:28.261 --> 10:29.763
Another hour or
two, at the most.

10:29.797 --> 10:31.431
Oh, okay, great.
So when the bucket's full,

10:31.464 --> 10:33.300
maybe we should just toss it out
into the street

10:33.333 --> 10:34.367
like we do
with the chamber pots.

10:34.401 --> 10:35.368
Hey. Kem Likasu, please.

10:35.402 --> 10:36.670
Is this Charles?

10:36.704 --> 10:37.437
Hey, Charles.
This is John Carter.

10:37.470 --> 10:38.839
Good, good.
Is she around?

10:38.872 --> 10:40.841
Hey, Frank, I
found what used

10:40.874 --> 10:42.910
to be the Chief
Resident's office
down by the lounge,

10:42.943 --> 10:44.678
but there's a
ton of boxes I
need you to move.

10:44.712 --> 10:46.146
She what?
I look like Bekins to you?

10:46.179 --> 10:47.214
Get a couple of your interns,
lean on them.

10:47.247 --> 10:48.849
I... I...

10:48.882 --> 10:50.050
See, but they're
busy, and you're not.

10:50.083 --> 10:51.384
What happened?

10:51.418 --> 10:53.787
Ray, honestly, what
are you doing here?

10:53.821 --> 10:55.155
This is a
great program,

10:55.188 --> 10:56.857
you were lucky
to get into it,

10:56.890 --> 10:58.692
and you're just
taking up space.

10:58.726 --> 11:01.128
You don't think
I'm a good doctor?

11:01.161 --> 11:03.096
I think you could be
a very good doctor.

11:03.130 --> 11:04.231
But you know what?

11:04.264 --> 11:05.365
You watch the
clock all day,

11:05.398 --> 11:06.767
just waiting
to punch out.

11:06.800 --> 11:08.468
( sighs )

11:08.501 --> 11:10.337
You have two
weeks left on
your internship.

11:10.370 --> 11:11.739
Take your degree

11:11.772 --> 11:13.240
and go work
at a doc-in-the-box,

11:13.273 --> 11:14.742
or do air-transport.

11:14.742 --> 11:16.476
If you're doing this
to make a living,

11:16.509 --> 11:18.278
you don't need a specialty.

11:18.311 --> 11:20.748
You make more than enough money
right now to support your music.

11:22.983 --> 11:25.485
Don't sign this contract
unless you are sure

11:25.518 --> 11:27.755
this is what you want to do.

11:29.389 --> 11:31.759
( sighs )

11:34.928 --> 11:36.429
Did something happen to Kem?

11:36.463 --> 11:37.430
No. It's her mother.

11:37.464 --> 11:38.899
She's in the hospital.

11:38.932 --> 11:40.200
In Africa?

11:40.233 --> 11:41.468
No, her mother lives in Paris.

11:41.501 --> 11:42.469
Did she say what happened?

11:42.502 --> 11:43.937
I didn't talk to her.

11:43.971 --> 11:45.806
She'd already left
for the airport.

11:45.839 --> 11:47.941
Hey, Frank, I don't know
where Susan is,

11:47.975 --> 11:50.277
but would you please
tell her that I had to go?

11:50.310 --> 11:51.111
Go where?

11:51.144 --> 11:52.780
Uh, just tell her

11:52.813 --> 11:56.016
that I'll call her
from O'Hare, okay?

11:56.049 --> 11:59.419
I've got to go by
the bank on the way
back, if that's okay.

11:59.452 --> 12:01.121
Do you need anything
from Home Depot?

12:01.154 --> 12:02.489
Thought I'd swing
by before work.

12:02.522 --> 12:03.957
Home Depot?

12:03.991 --> 12:05.392
Yeah, I need to
get some anchors

12:05.425 --> 12:07.795
to fix that towel
bar Alex pulled down.

12:10.798 --> 12:12.132
Where are you going?

12:12.165 --> 12:14.134
Leave me alone, Luka!

12:14.167 --> 12:15.535
Are you gonna walk?

12:15.568 --> 12:17.404
It's got to be five miles.

12:17.437 --> 12:20.407
Towel bars!?

12:20.440 --> 12:21.408
Sam!

12:49.169 --> 12:50.403
KOVAC:
So, what's he doing in Paris?

12:50.437 --> 12:52.139
LEWIS:
Kem's mother is sick.

12:52.172 --> 12:55.075
Meningitis. She's
immunosuppressed
from chemotherapy.

12:55.108 --> 12:56.844
So, with Professor
Carter AWOL,

12:56.877 --> 12:59.212
you and me are stuck
picking up the slack.

12:59.246 --> 13:00.513
Five night
shifts in a row?

13:00.547 --> 13:01.849
What?

13:01.849 --> 13:02.883
The new schedule.
Morris?

13:02.916 --> 13:04.317
If that's
what it says.

13:04.351 --> 13:06.453
A swing shift and a day shift
back to back?

13:06.486 --> 13:09.389
And Ray gets every weekend off.
What?

13:09.422 --> 13:10.523
Hey, Cubbies-Braves, right?

13:10.557 --> 13:12.425
Got you covered, Chief.
All right!

13:12.459 --> 13:13.861
LOCKHART:
Oh, I see.

13:13.861 --> 13:15.228
So he bribed you
for a good schedule?

13:15.262 --> 13:16.463
Of course not.

13:16.496 --> 13:17.998
That would be
totally unethical.

13:18.031 --> 13:20.167
Oh, I hear U2 tickets
are hard to get.

13:20.200 --> 13:22.235
It's a shame,
I really wanted to go.

13:22.269 --> 13:24.571
Dr. Lewis?!

13:24.604 --> 13:26.339
( sighing ):
He's the Chief.

13:26.373 --> 13:28.175
Any way we can make Abby
Chief Resident?

13:28.208 --> 13:30.177
You know Morris isn't the
sharpest shovel in the shed,

13:30.210 --> 13:31.578
but he's a
paperwork hound.

13:31.611 --> 13:33.546
Besides, it keeps him
from seeing patients.

13:33.580 --> 13:35.248
Think of it as
community service.

13:39.519 --> 13:41.388
C.T. call on Werntz, yet?

13:41.421 --> 13:42.589
I'll call them again.

13:45.358 --> 13:47.194
Flowers usually work.

13:47.227 --> 13:48.261
Hey, Jerry, I want
you to meet KJ.

13:48.295 --> 13:49.162
He's our new volunteer.

13:49.196 --> 13:50.163
Ah, Volunteen.
Welcome.

13:50.197 --> 13:51.364
Yeah, Jerry
runs this place.

13:51.398 --> 13:53.433
He'll be telling
you what to do.

13:53.466 --> 13:55.568
Jerry, just have him
run specimens up to
the lab, or whatever.

13:55.602 --> 13:57.938
"Specimens"?
Yeah, blood, urine.

13:57.971 --> 13:59.072
Piss?

13:59.106 --> 14:00.540
( stifled scoff )

14:00.573 --> 14:02.309
Nasal swabs, wound cultures,

14:02.342 --> 14:04.144
stool samples--
the whole enchilada.

14:04.177 --> 14:06.379
Hey, Pratt, 47's pulling
in with a septic newborn.

14:06.413 --> 14:09.049
Hey, you don't like it,
the door's that way.

14:11.484 --> 14:13.520
Is "stool sample"
what I think it is?

14:13.553 --> 14:15.923
Mm-hmm.

14:17.690 --> 14:19.126
Septic newborn?

14:19.159 --> 14:20.393
So they say.

14:20.427 --> 14:22.930
Hey, you study
your antibiotics last night?

14:22.963 --> 14:24.531
The Gentamycin
for the open fracture.

14:24.564 --> 14:26.466
Come on, you should know
that stuff cold by now.

14:26.499 --> 14:28.435
You're gonna be an R-2
in a couple of weeks,

14:28.468 --> 14:29.569
supervising new interns.

14:29.602 --> 14:31.304
You got to start
stepping it up.

14:31.338 --> 14:33.040
Eight-day-old female,
febrile to 104.

14:33.073 --> 14:34.374
Grunting
with severe retractions,

14:34.407 --> 14:35.408
can't get a pulse ox.

14:35.442 --> 14:36.543
Tachy to 192,
resps 80...

14:36.576 --> 14:37.610
It started this morning.

14:37.644 --> 14:39.079
I thought it
was just a cold.

14:39.112 --> 14:40.480
RASGOTRA:
Access?

14:40.513 --> 14:42.415
Had a 23 gauge in the hand,
but it blew.

15:25.525 --> 15:28.395
Pardon?

15:28.428 --> 15:29.997
Vous parlez anglais?

15:30.030 --> 15:31.364
Quoi?

15:31.398 --> 15:32.665
Vous parlez anglais?

15:32.699 --> 15:34.367
Non.
No?

15:34.401 --> 15:36.036
Uh, je cherche... Mme. Almont.

15:36.069 --> 15:37.370
Fabienne Almont?

15:37.404 --> 15:39.639
Chambre...
Elle as chambre?

15:39.672 --> 15:42.542
Chambre quatre six

15:42.575 --> 15:43.576
quatre.

15:43.610 --> 15:45.612
Quatre cinqante quatre?

15:45.645 --> 15:47.514
Quatre... six... quatre.

15:47.547 --> 15:49.282
Quatre six quatre?
Oui.

15:49.316 --> 15:50.383
C'est par là.

15:50.417 --> 15:52.419
Merçi.

15:59.626 --> 16:02.529
( women speaking French
in hallway )

16:24.517 --> 16:26.453
John.

16:31.591 --> 16:33.293
What are you doing here?

16:33.326 --> 16:36.063
I got your message
about your mom.

16:36.063 --> 16:39.399
You should have told me
you were coming.

16:39.432 --> 16:41.701
Well, I called your cell.

16:41.734 --> 16:44.504
No, it doesn't work in Paris.

16:44.537 --> 16:46.239
( sighing )

16:46.273 --> 16:47.374
How is she doing?

16:47.407 --> 16:49.309
I can't tell what antibiotics

16:49.342 --> 16:50.710
they're giving
her from the I.V.

16:50.743 --> 16:52.545
Oh, she's not on antibiotics.

16:52.579 --> 16:54.747
They're not giving her
antibiotics for meningitis?

16:54.781 --> 16:56.649
Viral meningitis.

16:58.351 --> 16:59.552
Who told you

16:59.586 --> 17:01.321
she had meningitis?
I called the clinic.

17:01.354 --> 17:02.655
Charles said
you flew to Paris,

17:02.689 --> 17:04.523
and with all the chemo,
I just assumed...

17:06.459 --> 17:08.095
So, she's okay?

17:08.127 --> 17:11.098
Ah, she had a fever,
and the doctor got worried

17:11.098 --> 17:13.733
so he admitted her,
but she's much better now.

17:13.766 --> 17:15.667
MICHEL:
Ils n'ont pas
de sandwich.

17:15.702 --> 17:16.603
Alors, j'ai pris
deux croissants.

17:16.636 --> 17:17.804
Michel, je te presente

17:17.837 --> 17:19.606
un ami à moi,
John Carter.

17:19.638 --> 17:24.477
John, this is an old friend
of mine, Michel Timbaud.

17:29.849 --> 17:31.151
MARQUEZ:
BP's 58 over 29.

17:31.184 --> 17:32.352
PRATT:
She needs volume.

17:32.385 --> 17:33.620
ALLISON:
You're hurting her!

17:33.653 --> 17:34.854
We can't help
unless we're able

17:34.887 --> 17:36.556
to give her
fluids and medicines.

17:36.589 --> 17:39.159
I'm in. Portable X ray,
call R.T. for a vent.

17:39.192 --> 17:41.394
Good chest rise.
All right.

17:41.428 --> 17:42.729
Airway and access.

17:42.762 --> 17:44.531
Neela,
what's your plan?

17:44.564 --> 17:45.465
Normal saline, C.B.C., blood
culture, Amp and Cefotax.

17:45.498 --> 17:46.766
Good.

17:46.799 --> 17:47.700
Hey, your Hodgkin guy's
pressure dropped

17:47.734 --> 17:49.136
after the antibiotics.

17:49.169 --> 17:50.403
Run in a liter.
!
He's altered

17:50.437 --> 17:52.205
and trying to pull
out his broviac.

17:52.239 --> 17:53.340
PRATT:
Give the bolus,
I'll be right back.

17:53.373 --> 17:54.874
100 ccs NS
through the I.O.

17:54.907 --> 17:57.144
Will somebody please tell me
what's going on?!

17:57.177 --> 17:59.146
RASGOTRA:
We suspect your daughter
has an infection.

17:59.146 --> 18:00.513
We're giving her antibiotics
for it,

18:00.547 --> 18:02.149
fluids to help elevate
her blood pressure,

18:02.182 --> 18:03.716
and the tube
is helping her to breathe.

18:03.750 --> 18:05.185
I.O.'s infiltrated,
it won't flush.

18:05.218 --> 18:05.852
How old is she again?

18:05.885 --> 18:07.654
Eight days.

18:07.687 --> 18:09.822
RASGOTRA:
Her umbilical stump
is still attached.

18:09.856 --> 18:11.191
Is that bad?
No, that's good.

18:11.224 --> 18:12.525
Umbilical line kit,
5 French.

18:12.559 --> 18:14.227
Sterile 6s
and a 10 blade.

18:15.395 --> 18:17.197
PRATT:
Hey, Jerry,

18:17.230 --> 18:19.166
Hodgkin's guy needs a med bed,
and let the NICU know

18:19.166 --> 18:20.733
they got a customer down here.

18:20.767 --> 18:23.370
Your Volunteen kid doesn't
seem very interested.

18:23.403 --> 18:24.504
Yeah, well,
he's not.

18:24.537 --> 18:25.738
So, why is he
volunteering?

18:25.772 --> 18:27.774
He has to work off
his probation.

18:27.807 --> 18:28.908
Ah. What'd he do?

18:28.941 --> 18:30.843
Second degree
murder, I think.

18:30.877 --> 18:32.412
Really?

18:32.445 --> 18:34.414
He got caught
tagging a police car.

18:34.447 --> 18:36.183
JERRY:
Wait, he tried to spray paint
a cop car?

18:36.183 --> 18:37.717
Yep, with the
cops still in it.

18:37.750 --> 18:39.552
( chuckling ):
Whoa, the kid's got guts.

18:39.586 --> 18:41.188
Either that, or
he's an idiot.

18:41.188 --> 18:42.789
LOCKHART:
Small bowel obstruction

18:42.822 --> 18:44.457
secondary to a popcorn overdose.

18:44.491 --> 18:46.393
Six-year-old ate
a huge tub of popcorn

18:46.426 --> 18:47.594
all by himself.

18:47.627 --> 18:49.296
Yeah, and...?

18:49.329 --> 18:51.731
Call surgery
and get a C.T.

18:58.238 --> 18:59.839
Think they'll be ready

18:59.872 --> 19:02.642
to supervise interns
in two weeks?

19:02.675 --> 19:04.577
Not a chance.

19:05.778 --> 19:07.314
John?

19:11.784 --> 19:14.221
( sighing )

19:14.221 --> 19:15.888
That was awkward.

19:15.922 --> 19:17.924
Where are you going?

19:17.957 --> 19:19.826
Back to the
airport, I guess.

19:19.859 --> 19:21.961
You just got here.

19:21.994 --> 19:24.431
( uncomfortable chuckle )

19:24.464 --> 19:27.234
Well, you were right, I
should have called first.

19:27.267 --> 19:29.636
Michel and I
went to school together,

19:29.669 --> 19:31.338
and he's fond
of my mother.

19:32.805 --> 19:34.807
Are you two a couple?

19:34.841 --> 19:36.309
We were.

19:36.343 --> 19:39.312
Does he know
about the past-tense part?

19:39.346 --> 19:41.414
Are you jealous?

19:42.949 --> 19:44.684
Yeah.

19:44.717 --> 19:45.885
( chuckles softly )

19:45.918 --> 19:47.254
Hey, don't do that.

19:47.254 --> 19:50.923
Don't laugh at me.
Okay, okay.

19:50.957 --> 19:53.626
Are you
sleeping together?

19:53.660 --> 19:56.729
No... do not answer that.

19:56.763 --> 19:59.366
Well, you haven't
been dating?

19:59.399 --> 20:00.933
Look, is there
someplace around here

20:00.967 --> 20:03.570
where I can catch a taxi
and go back to the airport?

20:03.603 --> 20:04.671
Don't be so dramatic.

20:04.704 --> 20:06.739
Okay, look,
I'm sorry, okay?

20:06.773 --> 20:08.541
I'm tired...

20:08.575 --> 20:10.710
and I shouldn't have
just barged in on you,

20:10.743 --> 20:12.412
and I feel completely
ridiculous.

20:12.445 --> 20:15.815
Actually,
it was very sweet.

20:15.848 --> 20:18.951
Yeah.

20:18.985 --> 20:23.390
Okay. Look, I'm really
glad that your mom's okay.

20:23.423 --> 20:25.758
And why don't you call
me when you get home?

20:25.792 --> 20:28.528
John.

20:28.561 --> 20:29.896
Just stay.

20:29.929 --> 20:31.831
Just for the night.

20:34.066 --> 20:35.502
MARQUEZ:
Flushes easily.

20:35.535 --> 20:37.036
RASGOTRA:
Hook up
the transducer.

20:37.069 --> 20:39.506
Sats 93, systolic's
up to 78.

20:39.539 --> 20:42.309
Good. That's good.

20:42.342 --> 20:45.445
How we doing in here?

20:45.478 --> 20:46.379
What are you doing?

20:46.413 --> 20:47.647
Umbilical lines.

20:47.680 --> 20:48.615
You're what?

20:48.648 --> 20:50.317
Umbilical lines.

20:50.350 --> 20:51.751
I heard you. Why?

20:53.453 --> 20:55.688
I.O. infiltrated,
we needed access.

20:55.722 --> 20:57.390
Why not just put in
another I.O.?

20:57.424 --> 20:58.858
She still has an
umbilical stump.

20:58.891 --> 21:00.527
UAC and UVC allow

21:00.560 --> 21:01.761
for frequent
blood draws,

21:01.794 --> 21:05.565
gasses...

21:05.598 --> 21:06.633
Did she do
something wrong?

21:20.447 --> 21:22.349
Hotel Lamartine.

21:22.349 --> 21:25.518
I'll come by in
the morning, we'll
have some breakfast.

21:25.552 --> 21:26.953
Michel coming, too?

21:26.986 --> 21:28.988
He has to work.

21:29.021 --> 21:30.357
Those his real teeth?

21:30.390 --> 21:33.360
They're a little
too straight.

21:33.393 --> 21:34.627
Get some sleep.

21:34.661 --> 21:35.895
I'm going to
pick you up early.

21:35.928 --> 21:37.964
Ah, you get
some sleep, too.

21:37.997 --> 21:39.732
Bonne nuit.

21:50.510 --> 21:51.511
PRATT:
You can't be placing

21:51.544 --> 21:52.979
umbilical lines
by yourself.

21:53.012 --> 21:55.548
Do you know all the things
that could have gone wrong?

21:55.582 --> 21:57.817
Thromboembolism,
vascular injuries, arrhythmias.

21:57.850 --> 21:59.118
I thought
arterial monitoring...

21:59.151 --> 22:00.487
You're an E.R. intern!

22:00.520 --> 22:02.054
You can't go playing
neonatologist

22:02.088 --> 22:02.989
whenever
you feel like it.

22:03.022 --> 22:04.491
I did a bunch...
of these

22:04.524 --> 22:06.092
when we rotated
through the NICU.

22:06.125 --> 22:07.727
Really? And when was that,
two years ago?

22:07.760 --> 22:08.861
Have you done one,
or even seen one

22:08.895 --> 22:10.129
since then?

22:10.162 --> 22:11.798
You told me to take
more initiative.

22:11.831 --> 22:14.401
"Initiative"?
What about common sense, Neela?

22:14.401 --> 22:16.703
What's next, neurosurgery
in the lounge?

22:16.736 --> 22:19.406
You need to know
when to ask for help!

22:19.406 --> 22:21.474
W-What the hell
is this?

22:21.508 --> 22:23.410
What,
you gonna cry now?

22:23.443 --> 22:25.645
All right, look, you got lucky
this time.

22:25.678 --> 22:26.913
She's stabilizing.

22:26.946 --> 22:29.416
But you have to start
using your head.

22:31.117 --> 22:32.485
Now, go on,
get out of here. Go.

22:32.519 --> 22:35.422
I'll deal with
the NICU guy.

22:36.589 --> 22:38.925
( sniffling )

22:41.528 --> 22:44.130
( phone ringing )

22:52.939 --> 22:55.542
Bonjour. Hello?

22:57.610 --> 23:00.547
Um... I'm sleeping.

23:01.614 --> 23:04.050
It's still dark outside.

23:04.083 --> 23:06.085
All right, I'm up.

23:06.118 --> 23:09.155
All right, I'm up,
I'm up, I'm up.

23:13.092 --> 23:15.562
( horn honks )

23:16.629 --> 23:18.064
Bonjour, mon soleil.

23:18.097 --> 23:19.766
How's Michel going
to get to work

23:19.799 --> 23:20.733
if we have his car?

23:20.767 --> 23:21.934
Who said it's his car?

23:21.968 --> 23:24.103
Come on, I want
to show you something.

23:24.136 --> 23:25.938
Does it involve coffee?

23:25.972 --> 23:28.040
Everything in Paris
involves coffee.

23:29.041 --> 23:30.076
Whoa!

23:31.243 --> 23:32.211
( horn blaring )
Hurry!

23:32.244 --> 23:34.481
We're going to miss it!

23:34.481 --> 23:35.748
Where are we going?

23:35.782 --> 23:37.183
Nowhere. We're here.

23:39.986 --> 23:41.053
You got me up at 5:00
in the morning

23:41.087 --> 23:42.622
to ride a commuter train?

23:42.655 --> 23:44.824
Mm-hmm. Be patient
for once in your life.

23:52.732 --> 23:57.737
She spent the night...
at her dying husband's bedside.

23:57.770 --> 23:59.706
He was a member
of the Resistance,

23:59.739 --> 24:01.574
fought bravely
against the
Occupation

24:01.608 --> 24:03.976
while she smuggled
messages

24:04.010 --> 24:05.111
for the Free French

24:05.144 --> 24:07.880
through Nazi lines
on her bicycle.

24:09.849 --> 24:11.117
He still loves her,

24:11.150 --> 24:13.219
but she's not

24:13.252 --> 24:15.655
so sure
after all these years.

24:15.688 --> 24:17.156
He's an accountant.

24:17.189 --> 24:18.525
She is a waitress

24:18.525 --> 24:20.126
who longed to
be a singer.

24:20.159 --> 24:22.261
She had a mad, secret,

24:22.294 --> 24:24.263
tempestuous affair

24:24.296 --> 24:26.999
with her
sister's fiancé.

24:28.100 --> 24:29.201
What about them?

24:29.235 --> 24:33.005
Mm. It's a sad story.

24:33.039 --> 24:35.842
She only has a few months
to live.

24:35.875 --> 24:38.878
Cancer.

24:38.911 --> 24:41.147
They love each
other desperately.

24:41.180 --> 24:44.183
Spend every moment
together.

24:48.287 --> 24:50.189
What about us?

24:53.225 --> 24:55.562
Do you have a story for us?

24:57.897 --> 24:59.566
Quick, close your eyes.

24:59.599 --> 25:01.167
Quickly, quickly,
quickly, quickly!

25:01.200 --> 25:02.735
Come on!

25:02.769 --> 25:04.036
Close your eyes.

25:04.070 --> 25:06.105
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait,

25:06.138 --> 25:08.575
wait, wait.

25:21.153 --> 25:25.024
Paris le matin.

25:48.915 --> 25:50.883
What are you
doing out here?

25:50.917 --> 25:53.886
Deciding if I'm sick.
Pratt's on.

25:53.920 --> 25:56.889
Ah.

25:56.923 --> 25:57.890
Hey, Neela.

25:57.924 --> 25:58.825
Hey.

25:58.858 --> 26:00.059
I got you a bear claw.

26:00.092 --> 26:02.194
They don't have
the apple fritters.

26:02.228 --> 26:04.063
What are we doing?

26:04.096 --> 26:06.232
Neela's trying
to decide if she
should go to work.

26:06.265 --> 26:08.234
We get to decide?

26:08.267 --> 26:10.036
She put in
umbilical lines

26:10.069 --> 26:11.237
in a newborn
yesterday.

26:11.270 --> 26:12.739
Really? Cool.

26:12.772 --> 26:14.907
Unsupervised. Pratt
became unglued.

26:14.941 --> 26:18.377
Wow. I miss
all the good stuff.

26:18.410 --> 26:20.312
Well, I've got to go,

26:20.346 --> 26:21.881
or I'm going to be late.

26:23.115 --> 26:26.052
Got to get back
on that horse.

26:31.991 --> 26:33.660
( siren beeps )

26:37.429 --> 26:38.898
MORRIS:
Nothing fancy.

26:38.931 --> 26:40.667
Just some primer
and a couple coats.

26:40.700 --> 26:41.868
I was thinking Lichen.
!
Morris, I'm not painting

26:41.901 --> 26:43.069
your office.
The hospital does it.

26:43.102 --> 26:44.170
I just need a
purchase order.

26:44.203 --> 26:45.271
Yeah, a purchase
order that comes

26:45.304 --> 26:46.673
out of my E.R. budget.

26:46.673 --> 26:48.174
Hey, Pratt,
stabbing victim

26:48.207 --> 26:49.175
in Trauma One.

26:49.208 --> 26:50.677
Back up the
interns, please.

26:50.677 --> 26:52.278
Paramedics are two minutes out
with an MVA,

26:52.311 --> 26:53.813
nine-year-old kid.

26:53.846 --> 26:55.114
Uh, okay.
Hey, Luka, can you get that?

26:55.147 --> 26:56.816
I've got an
extubation in C.T.

26:56.849 --> 26:58.818
We don't have
to do the trim...
No, Morris, no.

26:58.851 --> 27:01.287
MVA coming in.

27:03.790 --> 27:06.058
Trauma panel,
type and cross for four.

27:06.092 --> 27:07.293
MALIK:
Pulse ox
down to 78.

27:07.326 --> 27:08.795
BARNETT:
Taking down
the neck dressing.

27:08.828 --> 27:09.696
Shouldn't we
tube her first?

27:09.696 --> 27:10.797
Be my guest.

27:10.830 --> 27:11.931
Maybe there's
something

27:11.964 --> 27:13.165
we can tie off.

27:13.199 --> 27:15.067
Etomidate and sux.

27:15.101 --> 27:16.869
BARNETT:
Got the jugular,
spared the carotid.

27:16.903 --> 27:18.404
I can't breathe...
BARNETT:
Okay, it's okay.

27:18.437 --> 27:20.006
You're going to sleep.
We'll breathe for you.

27:20.039 --> 27:22.008
Prep for a subclavian
on the right.

27:22.041 --> 27:23.442
8-O E.T. tube.

27:23.475 --> 27:25.177
Is this
the penetrating neck?

27:25.211 --> 27:26.746
Single stab wound.
Hypotensive.

27:26.779 --> 27:28.247
No sub-Q air.
Two of O-neg

27:28.280 --> 27:30.049
on peripheral I.V.
Pressure's up to 90 palp.

27:30.082 --> 27:31.718
I'm in. Bag her.

27:31.718 --> 27:32.752
BARNETT:
Got a flash.

27:32.785 --> 27:33.953
We'll have a
central line

27:33.986 --> 27:35.054
for the next
two units.

27:35.087 --> 27:36.856
Good breath sounds.

27:36.889 --> 27:38.891
Excellent. Maybe there's hope
for you two after all.

27:40.960 --> 27:43.796
Professor Carter.

27:43.830 --> 27:45.898
It's associate professor,
actually.

27:45.932 --> 27:48.801
( chuckling ):
Well, I'm proud of you.

27:48.835 --> 27:49.902
CARTER:
Susan didn't
get tenure.

27:49.936 --> 27:51.738
KEM:
Susan Lewis? Really?

27:51.738 --> 27:53.039
She's pretty pissed
about it, too.

27:53.072 --> 27:54.373
She's not
talking to me.

27:54.406 --> 27:55.775
Now, this is what

27:55.808 --> 27:59.746
I really miss in Africa--
baked goods.

28:02.915 --> 28:05.317
What?

28:05.351 --> 28:09.255
You have, uh... a lot of jam
on your face.

28:09.288 --> 28:11.323
Well, help me.

28:17.096 --> 28:18.430
Hello.

28:20.833 --> 28:22.268
Maman?

28:22.301 --> 28:23.870
Non?

28:25.204 --> 28:26.405
Pardon, il vous ennuie?

28:26.438 --> 28:27.774
Ah, non,
pas du tout.

28:27.774 --> 28:28.908
Tu viens ici.

28:28.941 --> 28:31.243
( speaking French )

28:31.277 --> 28:32.244
Tu dis au revoir?

28:32.278 --> 28:33.245
Au revoir.

28:33.279 --> 28:35.047
Au revoir.

28:44.323 --> 28:45.792
Hey, hey, got a minute?

28:45.825 --> 28:47.093
Uh, not really.
What's up?

28:47.126 --> 28:49.261
Uh, I got to finish
my rank list for my match.

28:49.295 --> 28:51.798
I could use
a little advice.
Excuse me. Excuse me.

28:51.831 --> 28:53.432
There's something leaking
from the ceiling.

28:53.465 --> 28:55.267
ABBY:
Oh.

28:55.301 --> 28:57.436
Okay, um...

28:57.469 --> 28:59.806
I'm going to move you...

28:59.806 --> 29:02.441
right over here...

29:02.474 --> 29:05.277
and Christian's going
to take care of you.

29:05.311 --> 29:07.079
Thank you.

29:08.147 --> 29:09.816
Is that what
I think it is?

29:09.849 --> 29:11.951
Yep. Susan, code brown

29:11.984 --> 29:13.953
dripping
from the ceiling again.

29:13.986 --> 29:15.955
Damn it, that is it.

29:15.988 --> 29:17.123
Jerry, call the A.O.D.,

29:17.156 --> 29:18.557
tell them we are closed
to trauma

29:18.590 --> 29:19.959
until someone comes
down here

29:19.992 --> 29:21.828
and deals
with the raw sewage

29:21.828 --> 29:22.962
leaking from
the ceiling.

29:22.995 --> 29:24.463
Is this
the respiratory distress?

29:24.496 --> 29:26.098
Jerry, what's open?

29:26.132 --> 29:27.967
There's a bed open
in Curtain Three.

29:28.000 --> 29:29.468
Arnold Brixton, 65,
short of breath.

29:29.501 --> 29:32.071
Sats 83 on room air,
91 on a non-rebreather.

29:32.104 --> 29:33.405
Tachy at 115, afebrile,

29:33.439 --> 29:36.142
good B.P., on theophylline
for emphysema.

29:36.175 --> 29:38.110
( coughs ):
Don't say it.

29:38.144 --> 29:39.979
Say what?

29:40.012 --> 29:42.448
I stopped smoking
five years ago.

29:42.481 --> 29:43.850
Good for you.

29:43.883 --> 29:44.984
Come on.

29:45.017 --> 29:46.853
So, I was thinking

29:46.853 --> 29:48.988
that I might rank County
as my first choice.

29:49.021 --> 29:51.423
You want to...

29:51.457 --> 29:52.992
stay in Chicago?

29:53.025 --> 29:56.162
Yeah. I mean, my friends
are here, all my family.

29:56.195 --> 29:57.997
He needs a monitor

29:58.030 --> 29:59.866
and a continuous Albuterol
with 500 of Atrovent.

29:59.866 --> 30:01.300
What about San Francisco?

30:01.333 --> 30:03.870
UCSF has a great program,

30:03.903 --> 30:06.238
but, um, County has
a lot to offer, too.

30:06.272 --> 30:08.841
MARQUEZ:
Look who's back.

30:08.875 --> 30:11.878
Okay, 60 of Pred
and a portable chest.

30:11.911 --> 30:13.479
And do you want
to talk about this later?

30:13.512 --> 30:15.481
Sure.

30:15.514 --> 30:18.517
Rebecca? Birdy?
They okay?

30:18.550 --> 30:21.220
Do you know them?
Yeah, they've been in
a couple times before.

30:21.253 --> 30:23.355
Circumferential ecchymosis.

30:23.389 --> 30:25.224
Neela wants to get her
a telemetry bed.

30:25.257 --> 30:27.526
What happened?

30:27.559 --> 30:30.863
Rebecca almost got strangled
to death.

30:30.897 --> 30:33.032
I tried to tell you guys
it is too dangerous

30:33.065 --> 30:34.901
for you to be out there
on the streets.

30:34.934 --> 30:37.603
I'd be dead if-if Birdy
hadn't stabbed her.

30:40.206 --> 30:43.109
You... you stabbed
the attacker?

30:43.142 --> 30:45.544
Well, I had to.

30:45.577 --> 30:47.579
Is she going to be all right?

30:47.613 --> 30:49.381
Yeah. I mean,
she seems stable for now.

30:49.415 --> 30:52.618
We might have to...
No, no, not Rebecca.
Shelley.

30:52.651 --> 30:54.253
Our niece.

30:54.286 --> 30:57.189
They're working on her
in that room over there.

30:57.223 --> 30:58.991
KEM:
I grew up playing here

30:59.025 --> 31:02.561
when we weren't
in Kinshasa
with my dad.

31:02.594 --> 31:04.931
My mum would save
the old bread

31:04.964 --> 31:07.099
so I could feed the
ducks on the weekends.

31:07.133 --> 31:10.937
There was thousands
of them in the summer.

31:10.970 --> 31:12.939
CARTER:
It sounds idyllic.

31:12.939 --> 31:17.009
Yeah. Yeah, it was.

31:17.043 --> 31:19.411
So, why did you leave?

31:19.445 --> 31:21.948
It was different
when I was little.

31:21.981 --> 31:24.083
You know, we were
a novelty then.

31:24.116 --> 31:26.953
My very white mother...

31:26.953 --> 31:29.956
my black father with
their little brown girl.

31:29.956 --> 31:33.492
( laughs ):
It wasn't easy
for them.

31:33.525 --> 31:38.397
You know that Joshua
would be a year old now?

31:45.471 --> 31:48.274
Uh, I'm going to head
back to the hospital,

31:48.307 --> 31:51.577
see my mother, okay?

31:55.982 --> 31:58.084
What are we doing?

31:59.318 --> 32:01.988
What are we doing?

32:02.021 --> 32:04.356
I still love you,
and I know you still love me.

32:04.390 --> 32:05.524
We talk to each other
every day.

32:05.557 --> 32:07.393
We talk for hours,
on the phone.

32:07.426 --> 32:10.997
We tell each other absolutely
everything about our lives.

32:10.997 --> 32:12.064
I make you happy.

32:12.098 --> 32:15.001
I make you laugh.

32:15.034 --> 32:17.103
I tried living
in Chicago, and
it wasn't for me.

32:17.136 --> 32:19.138
We don't have to live
in Chicago.

32:19.171 --> 32:22.308
You have a life there,
your career, everything.

32:22.341 --> 32:24.143
I would give it up for you.

32:24.176 --> 32:26.678
I don't want you to.

32:26.712 --> 32:29.648
Kem...

32:29.681 --> 32:33.685
we had a baby, and he died.

32:33.719 --> 32:36.022
It's a tragedy
that happens to people,

32:36.055 --> 32:37.489
and it happened to us...

32:37.523 --> 32:41.493
but that doesn't have
to define us.

32:41.527 --> 32:44.330
It doesn't.
We're stronger than that.

32:44.363 --> 32:45.364
Aren't we?

32:46.465 --> 32:48.034
I can't...

32:48.067 --> 32:49.168
We can have another baby.

32:49.201 --> 32:51.103
Stop, please,
don't do this...

32:53.039 --> 32:56.342
I'm sorry...

32:56.375 --> 32:59.245
I'm sorry.

33:01.713 --> 33:04.683
Are you going to come
to the hospital, hmm?

33:04.716 --> 33:06.718
'Cause Fabienne's going
to want to say good-bye.

33:23.402 --> 33:24.803
Tidal volume's 700,
AC 14 on 100%.

33:24.836 --> 33:26.538
Units three and
four on board.

33:26.572 --> 33:28.440
Ray, did you ever follow up
with Social Services

33:28.474 --> 33:29.808
on that home visit for
the Chaddock sisters?

33:29.841 --> 33:31.077
I'm sorry. Who?

33:31.077 --> 33:32.178
The two
old ladies

33:32.211 --> 33:33.512
that panhandle
on LaSalle.

33:33.545 --> 33:35.214
You sent them home
with their niece, right?

33:35.247 --> 33:36.582
The two old ladies
from a few weeks ago?

33:36.615 --> 33:38.084
Yeah.
Pressure's down
to 60 systolic.

33:38.084 --> 33:39.418
PRATT:
Check for tracheal shift.

33:39.451 --> 33:40.419
And let's get four
of type specific.

33:40.452 --> 33:42.088
This is the niece, Shelley.

33:42.088 --> 33:43.522
Birdy stabbed Shelley
because she was trying

33:43.555 --> 33:45.091
to strangle Rebecca.

33:45.124 --> 33:46.292
She what?

33:46.325 --> 33:47.393
You sent them home
with Shelley.

33:47.426 --> 33:48.494
Did you forget
about the follow-up,

33:48.527 --> 33:49.795
or just not want
to deal with it?

33:49.828 --> 33:51.597
No, I called,
but what am I supposed to do,

33:51.630 --> 33:53.565
chase them around all day,
make sure they do their job?

33:53.599 --> 33:54.800
All right, come on, people.

33:54.833 --> 33:56.502
Can we focus on this patient
for a second?

33:56.535 --> 33:57.703
V fib.
Starting compressions.

33:57.736 --> 33:58.837
PRATT:
Ambu bag.
Charge at 200.

33:58.870 --> 34:00.506
Does she have a cardiac history?

34:00.539 --> 34:02.208
I don't know, Ray.
You're the only one

34:02.241 --> 34:03.175
that's ever
met her. Clear!

34:03.209 --> 34:04.343
( zap )

34:04.376 --> 34:05.544
( laughter )

34:05.577 --> 34:08.514
( Michel speaking French )

34:08.547 --> 34:10.416
Quel menteur,
Michel.

34:10.449 --> 34:12.217
Ne dis pas de mal de tes amis.

34:12.251 --> 34:14.320
MICHEL:
Non, pas ici.

34:14.353 --> 34:15.587
( Michel speaking French )

34:15.621 --> 34:16.621
Oh, we're being rude.

34:19.491 --> 34:21.159
FABIENNE:
I'm hungry.

34:21.193 --> 34:23.362
Will you get me something,
mon ange?

34:23.395 --> 34:24.630
Oui.

34:24.663 --> 34:26.797
Vas-y, j'ai faim.

34:26.831 --> 34:28.400
Rapporte-moi du chocolat

34:28.434 --> 34:30.636
et un cafe creme
avec deux sucres.

34:38.177 --> 34:39.610
Thank you for the

34:39.645 --> 34:41.147
beautiful flowers.

34:46.418 --> 34:49.221
He's a very handsome young man.

34:49.255 --> 34:50.522
Who?

34:50.556 --> 34:51.723
Michel.

34:51.757 --> 34:55.561
Yeah. Yeah,
I guess.

34:55.594 --> 34:58.164
Also something of a fool.

34:59.598 --> 35:01.567
When are you going home?

35:01.600 --> 35:03.602
There's a flight
tonight at 9:00.

35:03.635 --> 35:06.705
You're giving up
awfully easily, aren't you?

35:09.308 --> 35:11.577
I was rather firmly discouraged

35:11.610 --> 35:13.545
from continuing to try.

35:19.451 --> 35:21.387
You know what life is?

35:22.954 --> 35:25.757
Joy and grief hand in hand.

35:28.960 --> 35:31.530
You can't know real happiness

35:31.563 --> 35:34.600
until you've had true sorrow
to contrast it with.

35:34.633 --> 35:36.635
Hmm.

35:36.668 --> 35:39.538
She hasn't learned that yet.

35:39.571 --> 35:41.507
KEM:
Leave him alone, Mother.

35:44.410 --> 35:46.245
We were just catching up.

35:48.880 --> 35:50.782
RASGOTRA:
Rib spreader.

35:50.816 --> 35:51.817
PRATT:
Abby, get
the suction.

35:51.850 --> 35:52.851
BARNETT:
I don't get it.

35:52.884 --> 35:54.386
She was stabbed
in the neck.

35:54.420 --> 35:55.654
Yeah, the knife must have
angled down,

35:55.687 --> 35:57.223
bagged the subclavian.
Stand back.

35:57.223 --> 35:59.225
This is gonna be pretty bloody.

36:01.693 --> 36:02.694
Dry as a bone.

36:02.728 --> 36:03.729
Starting internal compressions.

36:03.762 --> 36:04.663
BARNETT:
We put in six units.

36:04.696 --> 36:06.232
Where's it all going?

36:06.265 --> 36:07.666
All right, whoa, whoa.
Hold compressions.

36:07.699 --> 36:09.601
MALIK:
Fine V fib.
Internal paddles?

36:09.635 --> 36:10.769
Oh, man.
Son of a bitch.

36:10.802 --> 36:11.837
All right, stop bagging.

36:11.870 --> 36:13.872
18-gauge needle.

36:15.941 --> 36:19.411
( sighs )

36:19.445 --> 36:20.646
Coronary arteries are full
of air.

36:20.679 --> 36:21.880
An air
embolus?

36:21.913 --> 36:23.982
( Pratt sighs )

36:24.015 --> 36:25.784
All right, that's it.

36:25.817 --> 36:26.852
We're done.

36:26.885 --> 36:30.989
Time of death, 11:47.

36:31.022 --> 36:32.991
How'd she get
that much air
in her heart?

36:33.024 --> 36:34.660
I don't know.
She had an open neck wound.

36:34.693 --> 36:35.961
The negative

36:35.994 --> 36:37.929
intrathoracic pressure
sucked the air

36:37.963 --> 36:39.798
into her jugular, but I don't
see how that's possible.

36:39.831 --> 36:40.899
She has an occlusive dressing.

36:40.932 --> 36:42.968
I-I, uh...

36:44.636 --> 36:47.439
I took it down
to explore the neck.

36:47.473 --> 36:49.775
Was it before
or after the intubation?

36:49.808 --> 36:52.344
This was before.

36:55.281 --> 36:57.449
You took down
the patient's dressing

36:57.483 --> 36:59.785
before she
was intubated?

36:59.818 --> 37:01.320
Excuse me, Dr. Lockhart?

37:01.353 --> 37:02.421
Your emphysema

37:02.454 --> 37:03.555
guy is coding.

37:03.589 --> 37:05.724
It was only
for a few breaths. I...

37:09.528 --> 37:11.730
LEWIS:
Damn right we're closed.

37:11.763 --> 37:13.999
And we're gonna stay closed
as long as I've got crap--

37:14.032 --> 37:15.701
and I don't mean that
figuratively--

37:15.734 --> 37:17.336
literal crap pouring
out of my ceiling!

37:17.369 --> 37:19.004
I came back to check his neb,
and he was down.

37:19.037 --> 37:20.439
Mr. Brixton?
Mr. Brixton?

37:20.472 --> 37:21.607
PVCs.

37:21.640 --> 37:22.808
All right, a Mac-2
and an 8-oh.

37:22.841 --> 37:24.310
You should have come
and got me

37:24.343 --> 37:25.711
if it looked like
he was tiring out.

37:25.744 --> 37:27.413
No, no, he was holding his own.
( alarm )

37:27.446 --> 37:28.780
Systolic's 77.

37:28.814 --> 37:29.948
Okay. NS wide open,
start a second line.

37:29.981 --> 37:31.350
( alarm )

37:31.383 --> 37:32.851
Run of six.
!
All right, what now?

37:32.884 --> 37:34.353
LOCKHART:
Acute
emphysema
flare.

37:34.386 --> 37:35.987
He went apneic
on continuous nebs.

37:36.021 --> 37:36.955
V tach.

37:36.988 --> 37:38.390
No pulse.

37:38.424 --> 37:39.491
PRATT:
All right, start
compressions,

37:39.525 --> 37:40.759
and mark the time.

37:40.792 --> 37:41.993
Let's get an ABG and
a capnograph, now.

37:44.730 --> 37:45.831
How's she doing?

37:45.864 --> 37:47.899
Good sats,
no stridor.

37:47.933 --> 37:50.969
Got a repeat EKG
and neck films.

37:51.002 --> 37:53.339
You're doing good, Rebecca.

37:55.507 --> 37:57.943
I didn't mean
to hurt her.

37:57.976 --> 38:00.379
I just wanted her
to leave Rebecca alone.

38:03.915 --> 38:06.084
Did she suffer?

38:06.117 --> 38:08.086
No.

38:08.119 --> 38:10.922
We put her to sleep
to work on her.

38:10.956 --> 38:13.659
She didn't suffer any pain.

38:13.692 --> 38:15.627
I didn't mean to kill her.

38:17.763 --> 38:19.831
( teary ):
We love... we loved her.

38:21.900 --> 38:24.370
PRATT:
200.

38:24.370 --> 38:25.571
Clear!

38:25.604 --> 38:26.805
( zap )

38:26.838 --> 38:28.807
LOCKHART:
Back in sinus.
Got a pulse.

38:28.840 --> 38:29.908
Okay.
LEWIS:
What have you got?

38:29.941 --> 38:31.076
Emphysema flare.

38:31.109 --> 38:32.478
Abby had him
on continuous albuterol.

38:32.511 --> 38:33.845
He was wheezing
and tight,

38:33.879 --> 38:35.414
and given the acute
setting, I thought...

38:35.447 --> 38:36.915
Chuny, correlate the capnograph
to the ABG,

38:36.948 --> 38:38.083
set the rate at 40.

38:38.116 --> 38:39.785
Abby, what's the end tidal C02?

38:39.818 --> 38:40.786
96.

38:40.819 --> 38:41.820
Can you tell me why?

38:41.853 --> 38:43.855
He was apneic.
!
Why?

38:43.889 --> 38:45.924
He wasn't
ventilating?

38:45.957 --> 38:47.659
That's not an answer.

38:47.693 --> 38:48.994
He has
emphysema?

38:49.027 --> 38:50.929
Wrong.
Tired out?

38:50.962 --> 38:52.931
No. Basic
respiratory physiology.

38:52.964 --> 38:54.833
He was hypoxic.
MARQUEZ
ABG's back.

38:54.866 --> 38:55.834
PH 7 point one.

38:55.867 --> 38:57.002
LEWIS:
Think about it.

38:57.035 --> 38:58.604
Emphysemics chronically
retain C02.

38:58.637 --> 39:00.739
They rely
on relative hypoxia...

39:00.772 --> 39:02.641
To trigger
their respiratory drive.

39:04.643 --> 39:05.911
And I put him
on continuous nebs,

39:05.944 --> 39:07.446
blasted him with oxygen

39:07.479 --> 39:09.147
and took away his impulse
to breathe.

39:09.180 --> 39:11.750
Leading to hypercapnia,
acidosis and v-tac.

39:11.783 --> 39:13.785
I'm sorry.

39:13.819 --> 39:15.120
PRATT:
Don't apologize to us.

39:15.153 --> 39:16.955
He'll be okay
once you blow off some C02.

39:16.988 --> 39:18.557
It's a classic intern mistake.

39:18.590 --> 39:20.792
You won't make it again.

39:25.831 --> 39:28.434
Get up.

39:28.467 --> 39:30.702
Get up!

39:40.679 --> 39:41.847
What?

39:41.880 --> 39:42.881
What-What's going on?

39:42.914 --> 39:45.016
Tell them.

39:45.050 --> 39:46.818
That poor woman
in there thinks

39:46.852 --> 39:48.019
she murdered
her own niece.

39:49.955 --> 39:51.890
Now, Ray.

40:14.613 --> 40:16.582
( clears throat )

40:16.615 --> 40:18.717
Faites demi-tour
s'il vous plait.

40:18.750 --> 40:20.652
Quoi?

40:20.686 --> 40:22.654
Retournez.

40:22.688 --> 40:23.922
Retournez.

40:35.801 --> 40:37.035
( Jake sighs )

40:37.068 --> 40:38.537
Hey.

40:40.772 --> 40:43.709
If it's, um,
any consolation,

40:43.742 --> 40:46.845
that was a great
teaching case for me.

40:46.878 --> 40:48.614
I'm glad my public humiliation

40:48.647 --> 40:50.649
can further
your educational goals.

40:50.682 --> 40:51.717
The guy's fine, Abby.

40:51.750 --> 40:53.051
It's not your fault

40:53.084 --> 40:54.886
he smoked two packs
a day for decades.

40:56.788 --> 40:58.089
So,

40:58.123 --> 41:00.992
I, um, was thinking

41:01.026 --> 41:04.763
that I might rank County
as my first choice

41:04.796 --> 41:06.832
for internship.

41:09.635 --> 41:11.770
What about UCSF?

41:11.803 --> 41:13.772
Um, I don't want to go to UCSF.

41:13.805 --> 41:15.741
I want to stay right here.

41:20.612 --> 41:22.548
Don't do that for me.

41:28.019 --> 41:29.254
BARNETT:
Ooh.

41:29.287 --> 41:30.656
Now this...

41:30.689 --> 41:32.558
This was a seriously
crappy day.

41:32.558 --> 41:34.125
Who wants to go
get mad drunk

41:34.159 --> 41:36.094
and pick a bar fight with
a bunch of law clerks, huh?

41:40.566 --> 41:42.568
I still have an hour
of charting to do.

41:42.601 --> 41:44.002
How are Birdy and Rebecca?

41:44.035 --> 41:45.671
They're gonna be fine.

41:45.704 --> 41:47.272
Did you find out what happened?

41:47.305 --> 41:49.240
Turns out the niece had them
on the corner panhandling

41:49.274 --> 41:50.141
to support her crack habit.

41:50.175 --> 41:51.710
Knocked them around

41:51.743 --> 41:52.844
when they didn't
bring home enough.

41:52.878 --> 41:53.979
Well, well.

41:54.012 --> 41:55.681
If it isn't the three amigos.

41:55.714 --> 41:56.882
Let's me see.

41:56.915 --> 41:58.149
Failure to recall

41:58.183 --> 41:59.885
basic respiratory
principles,

41:59.918 --> 42:02.087
uh, unsupervised umbilical lines
in an infant.

42:02.120 --> 42:04.756
Ew. And a fatal air embolus.

42:04.790 --> 42:06.291
Wow. Hey, when do
the new interns start?

42:06.324 --> 42:07.759
A week from Monday.

42:07.793 --> 42:08.927
MORRIS:
Man, oh, man.

42:08.960 --> 42:10.095
God help your patients.

42:10.128 --> 42:12.130
( laughs ):
Wait up, dude.

42:12.163 --> 42:14.600
RASGOTRA:
Well, I don't know
about you, but I feel

42:14.633 --> 42:16.067
really inspired right now,

42:16.101 --> 42:18.103
so I think I'll go
and throw myself under a train.

42:18.136 --> 42:19.237
Mm-hmm.

42:21.072 --> 42:22.774
Don't go away mad, Jake.

42:22.808 --> 42:24.876
But do go away.

42:34.185 --> 42:36.321
( horn honking )

43:14.693 --> 43:15.761
( door buzzes )

43:35.246 --> 43:37.348
( doorbell ringing )

43:37.382 --> 43:40.185
( panting )

43:50.762 --> 43:53.799
I'm moving back to Africa.

43:53.832 --> 43:55.200
And we can start over.

43:55.233 --> 43:57.135
We can do everything
that we didn't do before.

43:57.168 --> 43:58.970
And you take as much time
as you need.

43:59.004 --> 44:00.839
You can take a month,
you can take a year,

44:00.872 --> 44:02.040
you can take ten years.

44:02.073 --> 44:03.441
I don't care.

44:03.474 --> 44:05.043
And I'm not leaving
without you.

44:05.076 --> 44:07.045
And I'm not living without you.

44:07.078 --> 44:08.213
( panting )

44:08.246 --> 44:10.448
I love you.

44:10.481 --> 44:13.885
( laughing )

44:13.919 --> 44:15.854
I love you.
