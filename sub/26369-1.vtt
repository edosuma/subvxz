32:40.291 --> 32:41.542
LEAH: Peace!

32:42.500 --> 32:44.625
(MUSIC PLAYING)

33:49.500 --> 33:51.291
(MUSIC CONTINUES)

33:59.917 --> 34:01.458
BEAU: Stealing alcohol?

34:02.834 --> 34:04.166
-You scared me.
-Can I ask you something?

34:06.834 --> 34:08.625
Without you getting offended.

34:10.708 --> 34:12.041
ERIN: Okay.

34:12.125 --> 34:14.250
How are you holding up?

34:14.333 --> 34:16.250
You're looking
a little frayed.

34:17.750 --> 34:18.958
I'm fine.

34:19.041 --> 34:20.667
BEAU: Just asking
just to make sure
that you're okay.

34:20.750 --> 34:21.291
Breakups can be difficult.

34:22.708 --> 34:23.625
(LAUGHS)

34:23.708 --> 34:25.500
-BEAU: What?
-(CHUCKLES)

34:25.583 --> 34:26.667
You know,

34:26.750 --> 34:30.625
I actually thought you were
gonna say something nice.

34:30.708 --> 34:32.208
Maybe you were going
to act like a human.

34:32.291 --> 34:35.583
But now what?
You're fucking Leah.

34:35.667 --> 34:37.458
BEAU: Leah's just a friend.

34:37.542 --> 34:38.750
You know what?

34:38.833 --> 34:42.166
I'm seeing someone too now.
It'd be rude not to tell you.

34:42.250 --> 34:44.041
He's a writer. Semi-famous.

34:44.125 --> 34:47.083
He's been called
"the voice of his generation."

34:51.333 --> 34:53.125
I don't want
to do this with you.

34:53.833 --> 34:55.041
(SIGHS)

34:56.291 --> 34:57.375
You know,

34:58.041 --> 35:00.500
I'm making my own movie now.

35:00.583 --> 35:02.000
It's a documentary.

35:02.458 --> 35:03.375
BEAU: About what?

35:03.458 --> 35:05.500
My burgeoning
new relationship.

35:05.583 --> 35:09.041
BEAU: (SCOFFS) Your burgeoning
new relationship?

35:09.125 --> 35:10.583
Yeah.

35:10.667 --> 35:12.583
Can I just give you a hug?

35:14.041 --> 35:16.375
Only if it's a platonic hug.

35:36.709 --> 35:37.792
Wait.

35:47.333 --> 35:48.959
PAUL: You saw Beau yesterday?

35:49.875 --> 35:50.291
(EXHALES) Yeah.

35:55.959 --> 35:57.917
He, um...

35:58.000 --> 36:00.792
He told me that
he wanted to hang out again,

36:01.959 --> 36:04.000
but I said
I was doing other things.

36:08.458 --> 36:10.583
Do you think
you'll talk to him again?

36:14.583 --> 36:16.041
Probably not.

36:20.583 --> 36:22.000
I have a surprise for you.

36:23.333 --> 36:25.208
-Really?
-Yeah.

36:28.333 --> 36:30.041
It's MDMA. (CHUCKLES)

36:30.834 --> 36:33.250
You bought me ecstasy?

36:34.375 --> 36:38.250
My mom keeps sending me these
panicked emails about

36:38.333 --> 36:43.125
all the drugs she thinks
I'm taking because
of stuff I posted online.

36:43.208 --> 36:47.458
"I don't understand why
you must reject me with
your terrible behavior.

36:49.000 --> 36:52.834
"When I send you an email
I would like you
to respond to it.

36:52.917 --> 36:55.625
"Your father may continue to
unblinkingly support you,

36:55.709 --> 36:58.166
"but I see what you post
on your web feeds.

36:59.291 --> 37:01.500
"Actions speak louder
than words.

37:02.834 --> 37:06.250
"It doesn't matter to you
whether you have
a mother or not."

37:06.333 --> 37:09.500
-Do you feel bad
reading that...
-While I'm on drugs?

37:12.667 --> 37:14.917
No. No, I just feel like

37:16.208 --> 37:17.709
she's ruining the drugs.

37:17.792 --> 37:21.500
My dad used to,
like, smoke weed

37:21.583 --> 37:24.583
and make me smoke weed
with him every night.

37:24.667 --> 37:26.291
I used to really sad about it

37:26.375 --> 37:28.458
but he'd just get mad
if he didn't smoke.

37:30.834 --> 37:32.125
Yeah.

37:32.208 --> 37:36.125
I don't want her
to feel like she's
failed as a parent,

37:36.208 --> 37:38.959
but I don't really
want to respond
to her emails either.

37:40.041 --> 37:42.500
We used to have these
crazy screaming fights.

37:42.583 --> 37:43.667
What about?

37:43.750 --> 37:47.083
When I was in high school,
I used to think the only

37:48.250 --> 37:51.208
solution to the anxiety
I was feeling all the time

37:51.291 --> 37:54.417
would be for me... For her

37:54.500 --> 37:57.333
to create all these
rules and punishments

37:57.417 --> 37:58.500
that went way beyond
reasonable.

38:00.750 --> 38:01.500
To take my control away.

38:04.792 --> 38:05.417
She didn't get it. She...

38:09.750 --> 38:12.583
I wanted to punish her back
for not understanding me.

38:13.625 --> 38:16.083
You know, they moved here
so I could become a...

38:16.917 --> 38:19.417
A doctor or a lawyer.

38:19.500 --> 38:23.750
Or something else
immigrants want their
American kids to be,

38:25.542 --> 38:27.792
but then I told them
I wanted to be a writer.

38:29.959 --> 38:32.208
You know, when I was
in college, they...

38:33.208 --> 38:35.041
They gave up
and went back to Taiwan.

38:35.125 --> 38:38.417
You don't think they went
back to Taiwan
because of you, do you?

38:38.500 --> 38:40.917
It was part of it. Yeah.

38:43.083 --> 38:44.333
After that period,

38:44.417 --> 38:47.375
I decided it was just easier
for me to be emotionless.

38:48.709 --> 38:50.375
More like I was
when I was a kid.

38:51.375 --> 38:52.583
ERIN: How much more?

38:54.083 --> 38:55.166
A lot.

38:57.333 --> 38:59.083
PAUL: Can I read you
something I wrote?

38:59.166 --> 39:01.250
"They walked arm in arm
down the street.

39:01.333 --> 39:06.083
"Reality had taken on the look
of a children's storybook.

39:06.166 --> 39:10.709
"Joanna asked Alex
if he'd ever been in love.

39:11.750 --> 39:14.834
"Alex thought about it
for a moment.

39:16.000 --> 39:19.500
"A light blinked on and off
in the sky.

39:19.583 --> 39:24.417
"He imagined being taken up
to the UFO

39:24.500 --> 39:27.291
"and bathed
in the radiant glow

39:27.375 --> 39:32.417
"of a many-tentacled synthetic
examination probe.

39:32.500 --> 39:34.333
"Maybe that was
what love felt like."

39:37.834 --> 39:39.792
I wanna go somewhere with you.

39:39.875 --> 39:42.667
-We could fly somewhere.
-We could go to Niagara Falls.

39:42.750 --> 39:46.709
If I go to Niagara,
I would peak on ecstasy

39:46.792 --> 39:48.625
in a one size
too large rain slicker

39:48.709 --> 39:50.208
while the boat takes you
under the water.

39:50.291 --> 39:51.709
That's too cliched.

39:51.792 --> 39:55.125
I would sit
at a high stakes poker table

39:55.208 --> 39:59.208
in an Indian casino wearing
sunglasses and a baseball cap,

39:59.291 --> 40:01.667
-smoke a cigarette...
-Better...

40:01.750 --> 40:05.333
Then say,
"Too rich for my blood, baby."

40:05.417 --> 40:08.125
We could get married
at one of the stupid chapels.

40:08.208 --> 40:10.458
There's a lot of ions
in the water.

40:10.542 --> 40:12.917
(EXHALES)
So it's really romantic.

40:13.583 --> 40:15.291
(JINGLE BELLS  PLAYING)

40:30.709 --> 40:32.208
(LAUGHING)

40:35.917 --> 40:39.917
PAUL: Ah, this is what
the universe created,
after whatever billion years.

40:44.291 --> 40:44.667
How do you feel?

40:46.667 --> 40:49.834
-A little depleted.
-What?

40:51.667 --> 40:52.917
Kinda tired.

40:53.000 --> 40:55.875
You should not have even
started feeling it yet.

40:55.959 --> 40:58.917
-What?
-Wait, we only took the MDMA,
like, 20 minutes ago.

40:59.000 --> 41:00.166
(CHUCKLES)

41:01.125 --> 41:03.542
Mmm, I forgot. (CHUCKLES)

41:03.625 --> 41:03.709
Oh.

41:05.834 --> 41:08.000
I thought maybe the drugs
were fake.

41:08.083 --> 41:09.250
(EXHALES)

41:41.291 --> 41:45.458
You see, when God is working,
a prophet is not a preacher.

41:45.542 --> 41:46.542
They speak from
the mouth of God.

41:46.625 --> 41:49.750
and He said, "How you will
know my prophets?"

41:49.834 --> 41:52.875
He said, "You will know them
by their works."

41:52.959 --> 41:57.250
So, I have to show you
the proof that his here
is made by God himself.

41:57.333 --> 42:02.458
You see, when God is
using you, it's different
from you in your normal body.

42:02.542 --> 42:05.166
He take you out of you
and He control your mind.

42:05.250 --> 42:07.208
And He control your thinking.

42:07.291 --> 42:10.458
And you will hear His voice
talking to you
from the heaven.

42:10.542 --> 42:11.959
Praise the Lord.

42:12.041 --> 42:14.208
And this symbol here
represents the sun.

42:14.834 --> 42:16.583
This one right here.

42:16.667 --> 42:19.250
Everywhere
you go in the world,
you see the same sun.

42:19.750 --> 42:20.917
Hallelujah.

42:23.709 --> 42:25.083
(INAUDIBLE)

42:59.625 --> 43:01.625
Two options I'd like to
discuss with you,

43:01.709 --> 43:04.125
just so you're informed of
all the services we have here.

43:04.208 --> 43:07.667
We have an extensive list.
Are you aware of our packages?

43:07.750 --> 43:10.959
There's The Lovers.
The Hot Night,
The Honeymooners.

43:11.041 --> 43:16.458
The Aloha Special.
The Portuguese Wedding.
The Liberace.

43:16.542 --> 43:18.333
-The Viva Niagara.
-ERIN: Yeah, that one.

43:18.417 --> 43:21.166
MARSHA: Ah, Viva Niagara.

43:21.250 --> 43:28.458
That is a Elvis-themed
wedding, tailored to
the Niagara Falls experience.

43:28.542 --> 43:30.500
Then there's the matter
of the witness.

43:30.583 --> 43:32.333
-Do I look like a pineapple.
(CHUCKLES)
-You'll be needing a witness.

43:32.417 --> 43:36.542
If you don't have a witness,
one can be provided
for you. Jose!

43:37.583 --> 43:41.834
His fee is $50.
You may film Jose.

43:41.917 --> 43:43.250
-Jose's often filmed
for a lot of ceremonies.
-Say hi.

43:43.333 --> 43:45.291
PAUL: Oh, good. That's good.

43:45.375 --> 43:47.667
MARSHA: And don't forget
to tip your witness.

43:47.750 --> 43:49.875
REVEREND ELVIS:
Come on, it's time to go.

43:49.959 --> 43:51.625
Hi, come on. Let's go.

43:51.709 --> 43:53.583
We're gonna get you
married now.

43:53.667 --> 43:56.667
Here we go, honey.
There's Paul right there
waiting for you.

43:56.750 --> 43:58.709
Paul, how are you?

43:58.792 --> 43:59.625
-I believe
you know this girl.
-What?

43:59.709 --> 44:03.041
All right, I want you
to get up there.

44:03.125 --> 44:04.917
Great, great.

44:05.000 --> 44:07.250
Well, guys, here we are
in beautiful Niagara Falls,

44:07.333 --> 44:09.625
ready to join you two
in beautiful marriage.

44:09.709 --> 44:13.291
Now, marriage is
a beautiful bond that
grows and grows and grows.

44:13.375 --> 44:15.041
And as you grow, you share.

44:15.125 --> 44:16.875
You share your lives together.

44:16.959 --> 44:19.625
You share times together.
You even share with Elvis.

44:19.709 --> 44:21.834
-Uh...
-Paul, I'm only joking.

44:21.917 --> 44:23.625
You know what, kids?
Let's get started.

44:23.709 --> 44:26.041
Paul, please place the ring
on Erin's finger.

44:26.125 --> 44:27.792
-PAUL: The ring?
-The ring.

44:27.875 --> 44:29.291
-PAUL: The ring?
-The ring.

44:29.375 --> 44:30.500
PAUL: The ring.
REVEREND ELVIS: You got
a ring, didn't you?

44:30.583 --> 44:31.792
-No.
-You didn't get ring?

44:31.875 --> 44:33.917
-No.
-You know what?
It doesn't matter.

44:34.000 --> 44:35.417
-We're gonna start off
like this.
-(LAUGHS)

44:35.500 --> 44:38.083
Paul, I want you
to look in Erin's eyes,

44:38.166 --> 44:40.834
and say, "Erin. I take you to
be my beautiful wife

44:40.917 --> 44:45.125
"in sickness and in health,
for rich or for poorer,

44:45.959 --> 44:47.250
"till death do us part."

44:48.000 --> 44:49.166
Erin...

44:49.250 --> 44:50.583
Say it.

44:50.667 --> 44:52.291
I take you, uh...

44:53.417 --> 44:54.542
(EXHALES)

44:54.625 --> 44:55.875
Hey, you know what, Paul?
Don't worry about it.

44:55.959 --> 44:57.250
-(LAUGHING)
-We get the gist.
We get the gist.

44:57.333 --> 45:01.583
Okay. We got it.
Erin, look into Paul's eyes
and repeat after me.

45:01.667 --> 45:03.959
"Paul, I take you to be
my beautiful husband..."

45:04.041 --> 45:08.291

-For richer or for poorer.

Never have you...

By the power vested in me,

45:26.208 --> 45:28.792
I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

45:28.875 --> 45:29.959
Paul, you may kiss
your beautiful bride.

45:33.375 --> 45:36.000
Little more, you got it.

45:36.083 --> 45:37.250
Little more.

she's been
Employee of the Month
36 months running,

01:06:41.125 --> 01:06:42.667
since she was four years old!

01:06:42.750 --> 01:06:44.083
Amazing!

01:06:44.166 --> 01:06:45.750
And him?

01:06:45.834 --> 01:06:49.333
This little bad boy?
He's the next candidate
for the new chicken sandwich.

01:06:49.417 --> 01:06:51.500
You could be eating him
next month, folks.

01:06:51.583 --> 01:06:54.125
We'll miss you.

a question?

Uh, yeah.

01:07:50.792 --> 01:07:52.834

a pregnancy test?

It was just in there.

01:07:58.041 --> 01:08:00.959
Well, then you'll see
that I'm not pregnant.

01:08:01.792 --> 01:08:03.500
I think it was just the drugs.

on birth control?

if I was pregnant,

What do you think
all of this is?

Hey, no, okay.
You're my wife.
This means a lot to me.

Do you think
I want a kid right now?

of my life.
