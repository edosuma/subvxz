00:42.720 --> 00:45.470
No, I didn't leave
Lindsey home by herself.

00:45.950 --> 00:48.185
No, the dog is there.

00:49.040 --> 00:51.532
Sue, come on, don't you think
you're overreacting here?

00:52.187 --> 00:55.417
Lindsey is almost 17,
I think she'll be fine.

00:57.107 --> 00:59.420
I know it's my weekend with her.

00:59.424 --> 01:01.217
Look I'll make it up to her okay?

01:02.867 --> 01:05.877
Hello?  Sue?
Damn it!

01:29.138 --> 01:31.276
<i>Hi, you've reached
Lindsey Meyers phone.</i>

01:31.277 --> 01:33.304
<i>If you're important,
please leave a message,</i>

01:33.478 --> 01:37.068
<i>unless you're Jerry, then you
can go fuck yourself.  Thanks.</i>

01:37.148 --> 01:41.108
Hi Linds, it's dad.
Please change your voice-mail.

01:41.858 --> 01:44.978
Anyway look.  I want to make
it up to you for working today.

01:45.068 --> 01:49.579
So why don't we go to the movies tonight?
I'll see if I can get off early, okay?

01:49.659 --> 01:54.369
Oh, and please remember to feed the dog.
And why don't you just stay home tonight?

01:54.459 --> 01:56.754
The last time you went out,
your phone battery died

01:56.755 --> 01:59.647
long enough for you to
come home stumbling drunk.

02:01.549 --> 02:03.281
Next time your mum's gonna kill me.

02:03.282 --> 02:06.345
Okay, gotta go.
I love you.  Bye.

02:11.419 --> 02:14.125
Want to tell me what's so important
you couldn't tell me over the phone?

02:14.126 --> 02:15.226
Last night's  meteor shower

02:15.239 --> 02:17.037
caused a lot of damage
all over the country.

02:17.038 --> 02:18.347
Nothing we can't handle.

02:18.348 --> 02:19.491
- But Colonel.
- But what?

02:19.519 --> 02:21.393
We've got bigger problems.

02:21.594 --> 02:24.170
General Magowan.
How bad is the situation?

02:24.205 --> 02:27.800
Mac, the president is so concerned,
my phone's been ringing off the hook.

02:27.815 --> 02:29.553
The Pentagon is running scenarios.

02:29.554 --> 02:32.659
Their expert, some physicist,
is coming in any minute.

02:32.694 --> 02:37.080
<i>I told you my name is Dr. Gordon.  I
need to speak with the General right away.</i>

02:37.170 --> 02:40.380
Ahh Dr. Gordon.
Make it through security okay?

02:40.460 --> 02:43.818
Yes, you can go, soldiers.
I'm sorry I'm late.

02:44.340 --> 02:45.844
Gentlemen, for the last 10 years

02:45.845 --> 02:48.551
I have been liaison between
NASA and the US military.

02:48.586 --> 02:52.140
Keeping them appraised of all
potential near earth objects.

02:52.220 --> 02:55.810
And by the look of this, we've
got a big one headed right for us.

02:55.890 --> 02:58.061
Oh my God,
how big is it?

02:58.141 --> 02:59.399
Well, with all due respect, sir,

02:59.400 --> 03:01.942
if this was the size of a
satellite, I wouldn't be here.

03:02.551 --> 03:06.460
This is a quarter of our moon.
We are talking end of days here.

03:06.761 --> 03:08.858
End of life as we know it.

03:09.821 --> 03:14.365
- And judging by its speed, I'd say...
- We are looking at a 48 hour window

03:14.366 --> 03:16.247
before it collides with earth, Mac.

03:17.201 --> 03:20.398
- Get the Colonel a cup of coffee.
- Yes, right away, sir.

03:21.211 --> 03:23.881
- Get the gravity of the situation?
- Yes, sir.

03:23.961 --> 03:27.780
I need to keep monitoring this
thing.  I will keep you informed.

03:27.781 --> 03:28.759
Good.

03:29.091 --> 03:32.551
Mac, you've trained the best.
Now we need the best.

03:32.641 --> 03:37.972
We need to fly some of our own onto that
rock and blast it out of earth's path.

03:38.062 --> 03:39.749
We have a Captain
James Wheeler coming in.

03:39.750 --> 03:40.759
Are you familiar with this mission?

03:40.794 --> 03:44.112
Sir, he's a liability.  He lost
a man on his last mission.

03:44.192 --> 03:47.322
Well, I'll let you decide
that once he arrives.

03:47.402 --> 03:49.496
Right now, we need to
issue a nation wide alert.

03:49.497 --> 03:52.083
Start moving people into
bunkers and bomb shelters.

03:52.282 --> 03:54.702
- God help us.
- Yes.

04:06.252 --> 04:07.725
It had to happen on my day off, huh?

04:07.726 --> 04:10.705
I'm sorry, Chris.  Five guys didn't
come in today.  Not even a call.

04:13.723 --> 04:16.410
- Oh!
- Man.

04:16.413 --> 04:18.014
The meteor shower did
really a number on us,

04:18.015 --> 04:19.839
we got fires popping
up all over the city.

04:20.103 --> 04:22.282
I want hoses in those
windows up there now!

04:22.783 --> 04:24.089
Come on!
Come on!

04:25.753 --> 04:29.034
- Anybody left inside?
- No, LAPD said everybody made it out.

04:30.613 --> 04:32.102
I don't think so.

04:40.523 --> 04:43.253
- Ready, kid?
- Yeah, how about you, pop?

04:43.333 --> 04:44.795
Let's bring the heat.

04:45.904 --> 04:49.538
- Got it?
- Oh man, we gonna need backup.

04:49.573 --> 04:52.794
- There's no backup, it's just us.
- Great.

04:52.974 --> 04:55.515
Come on, pal!  We're running
out of time!  Let's go!

04:56.054 --> 04:58.537
I heard those screams,
she's up here.

05:04.764 --> 05:07.894
LA Fire Department.
Is anybody in here?

05:07.984 --> 05:09.136
They are clear.

05:12.364 --> 05:13.960
Jesus, it's coming down on us, Chris.

05:13.961 --> 05:15.501
We got to find this lady and
get the hell out of here.

05:15.502 --> 05:18.574
I know.  I know!
Is anybody in here?

05:20.365 --> 05:21.568
There's a room.

05:24.995 --> 05:25.897
Clear.

05:34.385 --> 05:37.009
- Where is she?
- She's not here.

05:39.475 --> 05:40.546
Going up.

05:42.595 --> 05:44.729
Come on, it's coming from up here.
Let's go.

05:54.155 --> 05:55.351
There... there she is!

05:55.352 --> 05:57.789
Stay where you are,
we're coming to get you.

06:00.116 --> 06:01.380
Sully!

06:08.036 --> 06:10.698
- You okay?
- I don't know, I think it's broken.

06:12.216 --> 06:16.016
- Yup, yeah, it's broken.
- We gotta get you out of here. Come on.

06:16.096 --> 06:19.038
Well, what are you gonna do?  Go
after her by yourself?  Come on!  Go!

06:19.039 --> 06:21.691
What you gonna do?
Stop me?  Come on.  Let's go!

06:25.096 --> 06:26.610
You're gonna be okay.

06:29.066 --> 06:31.897
Come on.  We are almost
there... almost there.

06:33.187 --> 06:35.728
Come on, get him.
His leg's broken.

06:35.907 --> 06:38.188
- I'm going back in.
- What?  Chris!

06:38.189 --> 06:39.676
Chris, what are you doing?
Come on!

06:39.711 --> 06:43.247
Is he crazy?  That roof
top's going to give way.

06:46.117 --> 06:49.625
- And what's taking so long?
- Come on, Chris.  Come on.

06:54.507 --> 06:56.273
Well, I think I got him.  Look!

07:09.188 --> 07:12.592
- Jesus Christ, Chris what are you doing?
- The elevator was broken.

07:13.608 --> 07:16.403
- How's your leg.
- It's been better.

07:16.758 --> 07:18.673
Glad we didn't take
the short way down.

07:21.908 --> 07:24.738
Excuse me, General... Colonel.

07:24.828 --> 07:28.828
Captain Wheeler, thank you for coming.
Do you know Colonel McCanless?

07:28.908 --> 07:33.878
Only by reputation.  I heard he
was the best pilot in the Air Force.

07:33.958 --> 07:36.812
We're glad you decided to
come in on such short notice.

07:36.847 --> 07:40.300
Well, I don't think I had much of a choice.
Your goons are very pushy.

07:40.568 --> 07:46.849
But at least now I can make myself
clear.  Whatever it is, it's no.

07:46.929 --> 07:50.580
- I'm done.
- Done?

07:50.681 --> 07:53.907
Then how come you're still
wearing those tags, Captain.

08:00.109 --> 08:03.540
- I said I'm done.
- He is very reassuring.

08:06.199 --> 08:08.445
How much longer are you
gonna torture yourself?

08:09.499 --> 08:11.531
It's been two years.

08:12.499 --> 08:16.749
You lost one man, and
saved several others.

08:16.839 --> 08:21.840
It doesn't mean anything.  Now
there's nothing I can do to change it.

08:21.920 --> 08:24.211
How about saving lives of billions?

08:26.590 --> 08:28.300
Why exactly am I here?

08:28.760 --> 08:31.628
The meteor shower that's
been sweeping the world.

08:31.663 --> 08:35.275
Right now, going the path of a
mass of asteroid heading for Earth.

08:35.390 --> 08:41.890
We're being told from the sheer size
of it, on impact, nothing will live.

08:43.190 --> 08:45.097
Do we have your attention now?

08:47.160 --> 08:48.920
What do you want from me?

08:49.010 --> 08:52.288
We want you to go up
there, dig, plant charges

08:52.289 --> 08:54.941
and blow this thing to
hell before it reaches earth.

08:55.581 --> 08:59.598
- How much time do we have?
- Impact in 46 hours.

09:02.421 --> 09:05.277
I am afraid this is a
time sensitive situation.

09:05.378 --> 09:08.124
So we're going to need
an immediate response.

09:08.891 --> 09:11.764
- If I do this...
- Captain, it won't be like before.

09:11.899 --> 09:14.554
We're not sending you
behind enemy lines.

09:14.721 --> 09:16.525
It sounds like you're
sending me to hell.

09:17.981 --> 09:21.046
Jim, please.

09:22.061 --> 09:23.656
We need you.

09:24.191 --> 09:28.346
You can watch the world burn, or
you can do something to change it.

09:29.361 --> 09:34.744
My mission, my team.
No exceptions.

09:42.632 --> 09:44.448
Are you sure about this man, General?

09:44.449 --> 09:47.350
Sometimes, Colonel, you
just have to act on faith.

09:59.682 --> 10:00.942
At ease.

10:01.022 --> 10:04.293
General Magowan.
Sergeant Clayton, Reconnaissance.

10:05.982 --> 10:07.323
Sir.

10:07.403 --> 10:10.217
- Corporal Cabrera, Demolitions.
- Sir.

10:11.033 --> 10:14.383
- Lieutenant Southard, Communications.
- Sir.

10:14.418 --> 10:18.663
- Fitzpatrick and Sanchez, Pilots.
- Sir.

10:18.743 --> 10:23.833
General, meet the roughnecks.

10:23.913 --> 10:28.222
- Relieved yet?
- I will be, once you get back.

10:34.093 --> 10:35.629
Captain Wheeler.

10:38.143 --> 10:41.223
Allow me to introduce Dr. Gordon.

10:41.313 --> 10:44.710
- The Pentagon's most brilliant physicist.
- Oh, I don't know about that.

10:46.194 --> 10:49.024
Very nice to meet you,
Captain Wheeler.

10:49.114 --> 10:51.404
May I introduce you to your shuttle?

10:56.324 --> 10:58.968
The SI-22 Astraeus.

11:07.964 --> 11:10.257
The Astraeus was
designed as an interceptor

11:10.258 --> 11:12.755
for satellite and
base station emergencies.

11:12.764 --> 11:15.325
We filled her up for
exactly one round trip,

11:15.326 --> 11:18.283
so don't take her sightseeing
in between or anything.

11:18.318 --> 11:20.765
We've loaded the
equipment and schematics

11:20.766 --> 11:24.681
as to exactly where to dig
and bury the explosives.

11:24.716 --> 11:27.855
- We're not getting weapons?
- For the asteroid?  No.

11:27.935 --> 11:32.415
But for security reasons there
is a locked case with firearm.

11:33.155 --> 11:35.775
We wouldn't want you guys
getting all... trigger-happy.

11:35.865 --> 11:38.206
Great, so we've got tickets
to the end of the world,

11:38.207 --> 11:39.738
and we don't have any damn guns.

11:39.995 --> 11:44.075
Don't worry, the US government
will be rewarding you all handsomely.

11:44.165 --> 11:46.255
- How handsome?
- Three.

11:46.335 --> 11:49.405
- Hundred thousand?
- Million.

11:49.585 --> 11:52.337
Get this mother started,
I'm ready to go!

11:53.426 --> 11:57.559
- Alright, let's do this.
- Suit up.

11:59.426 --> 12:03.021
- Well, I guess we'll see you up there.
- We?

12:03.056 --> 12:05.106
Uh yeah.  Unless you've got...

12:05.107 --> 12:07.821
someone who knows interstellar
rock formations better than I do.

12:08.396 --> 12:11.356
- I mean, if you do, that's cool.
- We it is.

12:11.446 --> 12:15.406
You didn't think I was gonna
let you have all the fun, did you?

12:15.486 --> 12:18.342
So, take her out easy.
I've just waxed her.

12:24.886 --> 12:28.031
<i>Launch.  Minus five minutes.</i>

12:29.067 --> 12:31.507
- Think you got this?
- Oh sure.

12:31.587 --> 12:34.058
I've got a 30-minute
crash course in piloting

12:34.059 --> 12:36.520
a billion dollar government
funded space shuttle.

12:36.547 --> 12:39.717
- It's not to get.
- Thought so.

12:39.807 --> 12:44.097
<i>- Well, hold tight back there.
- Take-off is in 30 seconds.</i>

12:44.177 --> 12:47.097
<i>Once you're on the rock you may
have difficulty with radio transmission.</i>

12:47.187 --> 12:53.237
Well, that's why we've got this
satellite beacon, to amplify our signal.

12:58.067 --> 12:59.940
Better stay tight.

13:02.747 --> 13:05.538
- You ready?
- You know I'm ready.

13:05.618 --> 13:07.190
You were born ready.

13:16.258 --> 13:17.567
Jesus!

13:20.878 --> 13:23.438
Whoo... oooo.

13:25.268 --> 13:29.768
- They serve refreshments on this flight?
- Shut up.

13:50.329 --> 13:51.731
We made it.

13:52.379 --> 13:56.089
Not yet.
Still a way to go.

13:57.879 --> 13:59.090
How's the ride?

14:03.679 --> 14:05.753
Okay, that can't be good.

14:07.229 --> 14:08.484
What the hell...

14:10.809 --> 14:13.012
What the hell is that?
Talk to me.

14:13.099 --> 14:16.610
Our planned course is incorrect.  We're
on collision course with the asteroid.

14:16.880 --> 14:18.463
What?
That doesn't make sense.

14:18.464 --> 14:20.873
Based on its speed, we knew
how much to compensate

14:20.874 --> 14:22.663
for that travel time
for it to be much easier.

14:22.748 --> 14:25.132
- It seems to be slowing down.
- What?

14:25.133 --> 14:27.837
If we check the distance from
earth we're faster than that

14:27.872 --> 14:30.241
- instead we're slowing down.
- Well, that can't be good.

14:30.290 --> 14:33.510
To say the least.  Oh no,
everyone back in your seats.

14:33.511 --> 14:35.529
- Why?
- We're going in too fast.

14:35.530 --> 14:36.644
This is going to be rough.

14:36.730 --> 14:37.983
Hang on!

14:58.111 --> 14:59.767
Fire the front boosters.

15:03.491 --> 15:04.696
Oh, my God!

15:09.831 --> 15:11.017
Come on!

15:38.902 --> 15:43.862
- Crap yourself?
- Get real.

15:45.072 --> 15:48.742
Wow, what is this, Gonzo rock?

15:49.572 --> 15:51.045
Watch ***.

15:55.042 --> 15:56.628
Now you all have your coordinates.

15:56.629 --> 15:59.449
Locate your targets and
mark them with a tracking rod.

15:59.750 --> 16:00.723
Got it, sir!

16:00.758 --> 16:03.323
Clayton, you make your
way cutting and drilling.

16:03.403 --> 16:06.951
Cabrera and Southard, you hustle back
to the ship and prep the explosives.

16:06.952 --> 16:08.215
Stick together.

16:08.463 --> 16:11.524
Fitzpatrick and Sanchez,
you'll prep the shuttle for take-off.

16:11.825 --> 16:13.101
Read you, Captain.

16:13.683 --> 16:18.202
- The clock is ticking! Squad move out!
- Sir, sir.

16:18.523 --> 16:20.969
Okay!  Let's go.

16:25.903 --> 16:28.482
Don't look at me.
She's your tourist.

16:41.084 --> 16:43.837
I'll start here.

16:47.674 --> 16:50.226
One asteroid root
canal coming up now.

17:00.314 --> 17:03.065
- That's odd.
- What is it?

17:04.564 --> 17:06.575
I'm drilling, but I'm only 50 feet in.

17:06.576 --> 17:08.912
Just having a hard time
getting any deeper.

17:09.273 --> 17:11.734
- That's not deep enough.
- Keep at it.

17:12.483 --> 17:13.903
Yes, sir.

17:15.285 --> 17:19.743
- Come on, get more locations marked.
- It's got a chamber.

17:21.204 --> 17:22.300
What?

17:23.295 --> 17:26.450
There, you see that?

17:27.085 --> 17:28.965
A cave.

17:29.045 --> 17:31.592
If there are passages, then maybe

17:31.593 --> 17:34.825
there's a cavern that leads
to this asteroid's epicenter.

17:34.860 --> 17:36.077
We could plant the charges there,

17:36.078 --> 17:39.131
and then we won't have to dig in
order to completely destroy this thing.

17:42.475 --> 17:48.598
Squad, we're going to scout a nearby
cave as a potential detonation point.

17:49.025 --> 17:52.316
- Stay the course.
- Whoa!  What!  A cave?

17:52.406 --> 17:57.906
<i> Just be careful, I mean, we're only
near them craters.  Watch yourself, sir.</i>

18:19.976 --> 18:24.856
- Come on, this way.
- Easy, Doctor.

18:42.367 --> 18:43.677
Captain James?

18:44.457 --> 18:45.457
What do you got?

18:49.627 --> 18:50.532
Look!

18:53.797 --> 18:56.592
Well, this doesn't make sense.

18:58.217 --> 19:01.557
<i> - Captain, come in!
- Go ahead, Southard.</i>

19:01.637 --> 19:03.728
<i>- There's something out here.
- What?</i>

19:03.808 --> 19:06.152
<i> Cabrera and I were marking
our coordinates and...</i>

19:06.353 --> 19:07.778
And what?

19:08.308 --> 19:10.918
<i> Something moved about here.
I saw it went right by us.</i>

19:12.068 --> 19:15.586
<i>- Debris?
- Captain, where are you?</i>

19:17.318 --> 19:19.083
Stand by guys.

19:31.998 --> 19:34.006
What the hell is this?

19:35.548 --> 19:37.311
This is weird.

19:44.599 --> 19:46.483
I don't like this.

19:47.099 --> 19:49.400
I've never seen anything like this.

19:50.979 --> 19:52.514
What's that?

19:54.609 --> 19:56.377
Don't.

20:00.569 --> 20:02.853
Okay, this is not an asteroid.

20:03.159 --> 20:06.012
Everyone, back to the ship.
Now!

20:07.289 --> 20:10.005
Whoa, the whole
damn thing is shaking.

20:17.970 --> 20:20.717
Hey, jump!
Come on!

20:23.260 --> 20:24.778
Jump!

20:26.150 --> 20:27.446
You got this.

20:28.680 --> 20:31.823
- Good jump, girl.
- What the hell is going on?

20:31.858 --> 20:32.803
I don't know.

20:34.480 --> 20:36.811
Oh my God.
Go!

20:38.400 --> 20:39.620
What is that?

20:41.110 --> 20:44.206
Control!  We have hundreds of bogeys
about to enter Earth's atmosphere.

20:44.207 --> 20:45.831
<i>Say it again, I'm afraid.</i>

20:46.700 --> 20:50.431
Enemy aircrafts. Can you read?
Alert everyone.

20:51.251 --> 20:53.751
30 kilometers outside of
Saint-Guilhem-le-Desert, France.

21:14.541 --> 21:15.849
Jesus...

21:21.991 --> 21:23.623
What the...

21:41.132 --> 21:42.768
Oh my God.

22:23.793 --> 22:24.829
Fuck!

22:30.763 --> 22:31.600
Please, not now.

22:34.013 --> 22:35.251
No! Come on!

22:36.774 --> 22:37.837
Come on!

22:55.454 --> 22:57.285
No!

23:09.704 --> 23:11.666
You think that was enough
excitement for one day.

23:11.765 --> 23:13.580
Yeah, relax would you?

23:25.845 --> 23:29.244
- Have you ever seen anything like this?
- What is that?

23:32.745 --> 23:36.048
Station 2-4-9, this is Hansen.
Do you copy?  Are you seeing this?

23:38.745 --> 23:40.854
- Coming in too fast there.
- Halt.

23:40.915 --> 23:41.967
Look out!

23:45.415 --> 23:48.304
- Turn off your engine.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey.

23:49.086 --> 23:51.523
- Turn off your engine.
- I'll call you back.

23:54.806 --> 23:56.522
What the hell is going on out here?

23:56.876 --> 23:59.392
- This is a restricted area!
- What are you talking about?

23:59.393 --> 24:00.813
Our department is only a block away.

24:00.848 --> 24:03.341
We have direct orders
to start relocating

24:03.342 --> 24:06.087
everybody from downtown
to a safe military bunker.

24:06.122 --> 24:08.319
Relocating?
Under whose authority?

24:08.320 --> 24:10.612
That's on a need to know basis
which you don't have to.

24:10.736 --> 24:12.684
- So get back in your truck,
I'll have my men...

24:12.685 --> 24:13.892
Incoming!

24:22.956 --> 24:25.140
- Captain, what's going on?
- It's an invasion!

24:25.141 --> 24:26.879
What?
What the hell's going on?

24:27.167 --> 24:29.291
- This isn't what we think it is.
- Yeah, no kidding.

24:29.292 --> 24:31.186
We need to get the hell out of here!

24:39.887 --> 24:41.117
Oh, God.

24:43.957 --> 24:46.839
Sanchez... Fitzpatrick...

24:49.357 --> 24:51.566
Hostiles.
Get back!

25:11.168 --> 25:15.882
- Alright everybody!  Into the cave!
- What?  I'm not going in there.

25:16.328 --> 25:17.795
Cabrera, get down!

25:25.938 --> 25:28.881
- Cabrera!
- No!

25:28.916 --> 25:31.582
Come on!
I don't think she's actually dead.

25:31.583 --> 25:32.766
Come on!

25:48.649 --> 25:53.627
- This isn't positive.
- We're trapped. What are you doing?

25:53.919 --> 25:57.433
- There's got to be some way.
- Take cover!

25:59.839 --> 26:01.273
How the hell did you do that?

26:01.274 --> 26:03.919
I think this is the same
thing that happened to Cabrera.

26:04.099 --> 26:07.391
I think they've discovered some
sort of teleportation technology

26:07.392 --> 26:09.615
or wormhole or something.

26:09.650 --> 26:13.111
Earth to Wheeler!
They're not giving up here.

26:13.920 --> 26:17.247
It's our only way out.
I'll see you on the other side.

26:18.620 --> 26:21.546
- Where did she go?
- She's crazy!

26:22.070 --> 26:25.490
- Maybe not!  Go!
- What? I was wrong, you're crazy!

26:25.560 --> 26:28.925
- I said go!
- Yes, sir.  Let's go, Clayton.

26:44.340 --> 26:46.840
- You guys alright?
- Ah, I think so.

26:47.141 --> 26:49.363
I'm alright.
Where are my men?

26:54.561 --> 26:57.266
- Don't shoot.
- I'm not going to shoot you.

26:58.131 --> 26:59.622
Whoa ssh...

27:58.052 --> 28:01.423
That thing is coming around.

28:05.763 --> 28:07.232
Where did it go?

28:13.263 --> 28:15.206
Ssh, get down.

28:27.263 --> 28:29.457
Shit, it's on the truck.

28:33.794 --> 28:36.374
- What the hell were those things?
- I don't know.

28:36.375 --> 28:37.825
I didn't get a good enough look.

28:37.860 --> 28:41.101
They destroyed the
radio and killed my men.

28:42.214 --> 28:48.514
Whatever they are, they're patrolling,
eliminating any hostile threat.

28:48.594 --> 28:52.020
- I can't see anything.
- It's because we are under a truck.

28:53.094 --> 28:54.429
Wait, wait.
Hold on.

28:55.314 --> 28:58.144
It is Lindsey.
Lindsey.

28:58.224 --> 29:01.768
Dad!  I'm so sorry.
Dad, please  come and get me.

29:02.194 --> 29:05.255
They came out of nowhere,
and we're trapped.  Dad?

29:05.290 --> 29:06.615
<i>Where are you?
Are you all right?</i>

29:06.616 --> 29:09.480
Yeah I'm okay, there are some
other people here with me.

29:09.905 --> 29:12.679
What do you mean?  You're
not at home?  Where are you?

29:13.075 --> 29:16.020
I'm downtown.
Dad, what's going on?

29:16.025 --> 29:20.465
I'm scared.  We keep hearing
noises and screams, and I just...

29:20.545 --> 29:24.975
Okay baby, I know.  Listen, wherever
you are, just lock yourself in tight.

29:25.055 --> 29:27.304
Don't go anywhere near the
doors or the windows, okay?

29:27.405 --> 29:28.392
Okay.

29:28.427 --> 29:30.330
Now tell me exactly where you are.

29:30.365 --> 29:34.385
They chased us into some old
office building near Union Station.

29:35.115 --> 29:37.356
Dad, what are these things?

29:38.515 --> 29:43.145
They are dead because I'm coming
to get you.  You just sit tight, okay?

29:43.235 --> 29:46.217
- I love you, Dad.
- I love you too.

29:54.246 --> 29:55.231
What's the plan?

29:57.246 --> 29:58.950
- Major?
- Blake.

29:59.496 --> 30:01.520
- Chris Meyer.
- Nice to meet you.

30:03.006 --> 30:04.416
Okay, look.

30:05.376 --> 30:09.964
They got us surrounded, but I think they
starting to leave away from our position.

30:10.506 --> 30:12.843
I think we can sneak out
if we go out that way.

30:12.878 --> 30:15.350
And I could salvage
any weapons I still have.

30:16.426 --> 30:17.572
What's the plan, boss?

30:18.306 --> 30:19.649
I'm going to get my daughter.

30:21.227 --> 30:25.028
- His daughter is not worth it.
- She's not that cute.

30:38.407 --> 30:39.946
Dad, where are you?

30:48.587 --> 30:51.087
No! No! Get away!

31:56.069 --> 31:58.079
Let's go.

32:13.590 --> 32:16.316
- Glad you could joined the party.
- Where are we?

32:18.720 --> 32:20.030
I thought we were history.

32:22.680 --> 32:23.864
Look at that.

32:31.190 --> 32:35.158
- We're not in South Central.
- What did I tell you?

32:35.900 --> 32:39.830
These things have mastered
technology far greater than ours.

32:40.110 --> 32:42.493
They are traveling to
earth through wormholes.

32:42.494 --> 32:44.762
That's great, but how do we get back?

32:47.371 --> 32:48.444
Good question.

32:48.445 --> 32:50.275
It's not like we
could just call for help.

32:50.310 --> 32:52.345
Our radios are crap out here.

32:57.261 --> 32:58.763
Sure, we can.

32:59.971 --> 33:04.678
We can use this beacon to
increase our signal and send an SOS.

33:05.681 --> 33:07.705
But it's only good
for one transmission.

33:08.231 --> 33:11.000
Alright, fine.  Do it.

33:12.351 --> 33:16.401
It's gonna take some time to charge.
Give it an hour.

33:16.481 --> 33:18.367
Fine.  Do it.

33:26.412 --> 33:29.525
Nobody leaves here without
my say so, understood?

33:49.972 --> 33:53.852
Whoa, whoa, wait, wait.
What are you doing, genius?

33:53.942 --> 33:58.773
We're on an alien planet, you
don't even know if there is air here.

34:02.823 --> 34:05.956
Don't worry, it's breathable.

34:06.703 --> 34:08.953
As you are.

34:21.963 --> 34:23.338
Well, that smells good.

34:26.663 --> 34:29.893
- I miss LA.
- Hey Captain?

34:29.973 --> 34:31.880
I think you better
take a look at this.

34:35.063 --> 34:37.136
I think we're in their backyard.

34:44.053 --> 34:46.483
Son of a...

34:50.873 --> 34:54.248
That's not all.
We're not the only ones out here.

35:04.164 --> 35:06.261
They're herding humans.

35:08.975 --> 35:12.905
- Doc, that absolutely needs an hour?
- Unfortunately, yes.

35:14.725 --> 35:19.615
Alright.  Now we send out an SOS
and just hope help will arrive?

35:19.795 --> 35:20.780
A whole lot of waiting.

35:20.781 --> 35:23.701
Yeah, in time for
those things to find us.

35:23.736 --> 35:25.585
Wait wait wait.
What about all those people?

35:25.586 --> 35:27.462
What about them?
We have to get out of here!

35:27.497 --> 35:28.855
Ah yeah!
And go where?

35:42.916 --> 35:46.506
Alright.
Saddle up, we're moving out.

35:46.586 --> 35:48.289
What?  Where to?

35:48.290 --> 35:50.402
We're going down there,
we're going to save those people.

35:50.437 --> 35:53.848
- Are you crazy, what about us?
- Stand down, Lieutenant!

35:54.786 --> 35:57.684
Those are innocent
people who need our help.

35:59.016 --> 36:04.816
The rest of you can either follow me
or sit here with your thumbs up your ass.

36:06.406 --> 36:09.579
- I said saddle up!
- Yes, sir.

36:12.246 --> 36:14.564
May I bother one of you for a weapon?

36:19.537 --> 36:20.803
Thank you.

36:22.247 --> 36:23.628
Let's move out.

36:39.267 --> 36:41.652
Try this. The bigger they are,
the harder they fall.

36:45.437 --> 36:48.098
Hey, right here.
Come over here!

36:48.099 --> 36:51.005
Yeah, over here.  Over here.
That's right, come and get it!

36:51.406 --> 36:53.197
That's right!
Get him Mike!

37:02.338 --> 37:04.045
That's right!  Over here!

37:14.718 --> 37:18.273
- I'm glad I stayed under here.
- Come on!

37:24.898 --> 37:27.609
Deb, Deb, where is Shawn?

37:29.739 --> 37:33.083
Where did you see him last?
He couldn't have just disappeared.

37:33.609 --> 37:38.156
I can't come home till they get back.
There are fires all over the city.

37:38.191 --> 37:43.129
Call the police.
Then try them again, Deb.

37:43.209 --> 37:48.489
Deb, baby, Deb, Deb stop crying,
stop crying, we'll find him, okay?

37:48.569 --> 37:50.870
I promise.
Okay?

37:52.259 --> 37:55.837
Deb?
Hello?

37:57.639 --> 37:58.690
Deb?

38:09.360 --> 38:13.061
I hope you know where we're going.
We can't keep running like this.

38:13.400 --> 38:15.043
Don't worry, we're close.

38:16.280 --> 38:18.820
Okay, come on.

38:25.920 --> 38:29.480
- Holy Mother Mary. Are you all right?
- Not exactly.

38:29.560 --> 38:33.575
- Samon, thank Christ you're alive.
- What the hell is going on out there?

38:33.610 --> 38:35.510
Well, it's the end of the world.

38:35.511 --> 38:38.701
Must be.  I haven't
seen anybody else all day.

38:38.800 --> 38:40.358
The others took all
the working engine.

38:40.359 --> 38:42.073
That one's transmission is busted.

38:42.521 --> 38:46.566
- Well, let's take my truck.
- It's payback time.

38:49.231 --> 38:51.861
- Whoa, whoa, whoa...
- Nice.

38:51.941 --> 38:56.691
- Whoa!  Where's the fire?
- I'm going after my daughter.

38:56.781 --> 38:58.220
And there are some out
of towners out there.

38:58.221 --> 39:01.541
They aren't too friendly.
If I were you, I'd arm myself.

39:03.991 --> 39:05.535
You're serious?

39:07.291 --> 39:10.508
Oh my God! My family, man!
I got to get to my family.

39:10.509 --> 39:11.920
I got to see my family!
I got to...

39:11.925 --> 39:13.881
Tim! Come with us.

39:13.961 --> 39:18.262
Here, sorry.  But if it as bad as you say
it is then I need to collect my family.

39:18.342 --> 39:20.342
If the power lines are down...
I need to go, man. I...

39:20.343 --> 39:23.891
Alright.  Just stay focused.
Be careful out there.

39:25.512 --> 39:28.642
- Good luck, Chris.
- Take care of yourself, Tim.

39:28.732 --> 39:33.732
Chris, I can't thank you enough.
I got to get back to base.

39:33.812 --> 39:36.258
- This is war.
- So give 'em hell!

39:38.482 --> 39:40.775
Well, you drive.

39:41.822 --> 39:43.103
Sully...

39:46.042 --> 39:50.792
- Why don't we back seat this one.
- Game on, boss.

40:50.434 --> 40:52.530
Captain, what is it?

40:53.434 --> 40:54.771
There.

40:58.694 --> 40:59.880
Where?

41:08.365 --> 41:09.620
What is it doing?

41:11.165 --> 41:12.370
What's going on?

41:13.835 --> 41:15.165
Something's not right.

41:16.375 --> 41:17.575
How do you know?

41:18.465 --> 41:20.037
They're hunting us.

41:21.175 --> 41:27.115
And that one is a decoy.  They rest
are going to flank us from all sides.

41:32.225 --> 41:35.725
- Orders, Captain?
- Run!

41:35.815 --> 41:37.733
As fast as you can.

41:51.286 --> 41:52.632
Hurry, this way.

42:40.787 --> 42:44.547
- It's gone.
- Oh Jesus.

42:46.087 --> 42:48.398
My heart can't stop pounding.

42:50.077 --> 42:53.460
It's war.
Get used to it.

43:11.698 --> 43:13.528
Hey.

43:13.618 --> 43:16.498
You okay?

43:17.828 --> 43:21.958
- I should never have left her alone.
- Hey, Chris, come on.

43:22.038 --> 43:25.758
Well, if she's anything at
all like you, she's doing fine.

43:26.048 --> 43:29.929
She doesn't want to
be anything like me.

43:31.089 --> 43:33.460
I break every promise,
I'm never there.

43:36.429 --> 43:38.060
Don't worry, we're gonna find her.

43:39.349 --> 43:41.729
Hey!  Hey!

43:41.809 --> 43:44.994
We're gonna find her, okay?

43:50.569 --> 43:53.739
- Guys guys, we got company!
- Oh crap!

43:53.819 --> 43:56.569
- Come on, let's go.  Faster, faster!
- Hang on!

43:56.649 --> 43:58.125
Lose him man!
Lose him!

44:06.570 --> 44:09.920
- Put some lead into it!
- This thing can't go any faster!

44:11.010 --> 44:13.829
Oh God Chris, when you last
time you got a tune-up?

44:19.010 --> 44:22.560
- Will, get us out of here! Now!
- Hang on, hang on.

44:22.640 --> 44:25.520
Chris, look out!

44:27.860 --> 44:30.884
- Thanks.
- Now we're even.

44:31.940 --> 44:34.990
- Sully!
- Oh Jesus Christ, they got Sullivan!

44:35.070 --> 44:37.639
- That thing is still following us.
- Eyes on the road!

44:41.791 --> 44:43.988
- What what...?
- The brakes are...

44:43.989 --> 44:45.576
What do you mean?
What?

44:56.131 --> 44:58.779
- Guys, get ready to jump.
- We gotta jump.

44:58.780 --> 45:01.294
- What do you mean?
- We gotta jump, we gotta jump!

45:22.282 --> 45:25.485
- We gotta jump... you ready?
- Jump!  I'm sure not jumping...

45:27.272 --> 45:28.621
Wait?  What?

45:49.132 --> 45:51.762
It's cool guys.  We got it.
Don't worry about it.

45:51.763 --> 45:53.997
- One more crap you'll stop.
- Mm hm.

46:16.423 --> 46:18.283
This is incredible.

46:19.263 --> 46:21.133
Ssh!

47:19.275 --> 47:22.497
You go where we go,
or get left behind.

47:23.365 --> 47:26.505
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be sorry.  Be smart.

47:57.216 --> 48:00.613
- What are you doing?
- We're bringing them back.

48:00.648 --> 48:03.153
He was already dead.
There's nothing you could do for him.

48:03.254 --> 48:05.527
Plus we don't know how
many more there are.

48:07.236 --> 48:10.067
- We got to be smart.
- Guys, will you shut the hell up?

48:20.707 --> 48:22.707
Take that, bitch!

48:26.217 --> 48:27.573
Southard!

48:33.937 --> 48:35.455
Cabrera!

48:38.727 --> 48:40.480
Get back, get back, get back!

49:01.698 --> 49:05.394
- You see anything?
- No, it's clear.  Come on. Let's go.

49:07.378 --> 49:09.753
- Where is your daughter, Chris?
- One block up.

49:09.754 --> 49:11.313
Well, let's get you there.

49:12.258 --> 49:14.558
- No no!
- Should we double back?

49:14.638 --> 49:17.359
No, into there!
Go go!

49:27.529 --> 49:29.683
Come on.
Go go go go go!

49:33.619 --> 49:35.659
Whoa whoa.
Wait! Wait!

49:35.749 --> 49:38.078
Hide hide hide.
Cover yourselves.

49:41.749 --> 49:43.828
Do you think it will come in here?

49:54.469 --> 49:56.084
I'm thinking yes.

50:06.320 --> 50:09.662
- Hey Chris, what are we gonna do?
- We got to get rid of that thing.

50:09.663 --> 50:10.666
How?

50:18.950 --> 50:22.038
Doing...
Come on!

50:33.890 --> 50:35.310
SCREW YOU

50:47.901 --> 50:48.943
Look out!

51:11.712 --> 51:14.875
Go, go find your daughter.

51:37.072 --> 51:38.639
<i>Why exactly am I here?</i>

51:40.322 --> 51:43.542
<i>The Meteor Shower that's
been sweeping the world</i>

51:43.622 --> 51:47.333
<i>Nothing will live.</i>

51:47.413 --> 51:51.920
<i>- We're not sending you behind enemy lines.
- Sounds like sending me to hell.</i>

51:53.003 --> 51:54.863
<i>Wait wait wait.
What about all those people?</i>

51:54.864 --> 51:56.949
<i>What about them?
We have to get out of here.</i>

51:56.984 --> 51:58.874
<i>We going down there,
we're gonna save those people.</i>

51:58.875 --> 52:00.095
<i>Are you crazy?</i>

52:00.883 --> 52:02.159
<i>Southard!</i>

52:03.313 --> 52:06.433
<i>Cabrera!
Get back! Get back! Get back!</i>

52:06.683 --> 52:09.459
<i>Mankind needs you.</i>

52:18.403 --> 52:19.704
Who's there?

52:26.454 --> 52:27.792
Who's there?

52:33.004 --> 52:34.324
What are you doing?

52:35.794 --> 52:37.496
I'm getting out of here.

52:38.594 --> 52:39.954
Why?

52:41.884 --> 52:45.071
So, I can get you to safety.

52:45.094 --> 52:47.785
From this side?
From them?

52:48.394 --> 52:51.338
Come on, I'm gonna get you out of
here.  You're gonna be alright.

52:51.444 --> 52:54.944
Please.  You don't understand.

52:55.024 --> 52:58.324
They've already taken my children.

52:58.404 --> 53:00.579
Please...

53:01.585 --> 53:04.405
- They've already killed me.
- Stop.

53:04.495 --> 53:07.909
- But I'm still alive.
- Stop, stop.  I can't do that!

53:09.085 --> 53:12.085
Please, please.

53:12.165 --> 53:16.965
I can't do that.
I'm not going to do that.

53:17.045 --> 53:19.925
Do you have any children?

53:20.005 --> 53:21.675
Do you?

53:23.635 --> 53:29.975
If you did, you'd understand.  They
become your life, your reason for living.

53:30.055 --> 53:32.287
- Please.
- Sorry.

53:32.288 --> 53:33.386
Please...

53:37.196 --> 53:45.144
If not for me, do it for my
Ashley, Annie and George.

53:45.696 --> 53:47.858
You remind me of him.

53:51.536 --> 53:54.246
Please.

53:59.716 --> 54:02.386
Please...

54:03.256 --> 54:05.676
Please...

55:28.299 --> 55:31.849
- Gordon!
- Hurry, they're holding us captive.

55:31.929 --> 55:34.662
- Quick, get me out of here!
- It's locked.

55:36.979 --> 55:37.993
Hang on.

55:46.399 --> 55:48.602
Oh, God, Clayton.

56:02.880 --> 56:09.590
Just focus Captain.
There's still hope for you.

56:11.760 --> 56:17.181
You and the doctor
can bust out of here.

56:20.480 --> 56:23.230
Summon the beacon.

56:23.310 --> 56:25.330
There is still hope for all of us.

56:26.780 --> 56:30.272
Captain, they can't find you here.

56:30.860 --> 56:36.101
You have to get out of here,
they'll kill you in the worst ways.

56:42.371 --> 56:44.921
- You have to.
- I'm sorry, soldier.

56:45.001 --> 56:46.041
The heck!

57:03.101 --> 57:06.392
Hey! Hey!
You stay away from him!

57:09.032 --> 57:10.686
You leave him alone!

57:20.582 --> 57:22.265
Can you understand me?

57:24.162 --> 57:26.435
You can't, right?

57:28.372 --> 57:29.600
Can you?

57:31.462 --> 57:33.273
You aren't going to do it, are you?

57:35.882 --> 57:38.923
You oughta make a run for the
beacon and get the hell out of here.

57:41.722 --> 57:45.270
Just do it!
And get out of here.

57:50.773 --> 57:52.065
Come on!

57:52.983 --> 57:55.428
Bring it! Come on!

57:55.783 --> 57:58.395
No, don't!
Don't!  Please!

58:40.204 --> 58:43.937
No, no, no! No!
Look out, look out!

58:48.664 --> 58:50.059
How long has it been?

58:50.060 --> 58:53.305
Nearly six hours since Captain
Wheeler's last transmission.

58:53.340 --> 58:56.345
Just over eight since he
confirmed the loss of SI 22.

58:56.425 --> 58:59.634
Stay on it.  Keep scanning
for the distress beacon.

58:59.635 --> 59:00.511
Sir.

59:00.925 --> 59:05.395
We're assembling men for the assault but
we need more.  You think Wheeler's team?

59:05.475 --> 59:07.355
We lost radio contact hours ago.

59:07.435 --> 59:09.291
Any more civilian survivors?

59:09.292 --> 59:12.134
Not many.  There's no
telling how many more left.

59:12.275 --> 59:15.099
With your permission, sir,
I would like to start rounding up

59:15.100 --> 59:17.928
anyone with military training
to prep for the assault.

59:17.963 --> 59:23.285
Permission?  We are talking about the
last effort to save our civilization.

59:23.365 --> 59:29.455
Our lives, our world.
This isn't war, this is survival.

59:29.535 --> 59:32.305
- Get as many as you can.
- Yes, sir.

01:00:03.056 --> 01:00:04.164
Damn it!

01:00:20.507 --> 01:00:23.010
Quick, get us something to block...

01:00:24.307 --> 01:00:25.820
Run!

01:00:27.927 --> 01:00:29.578
Come on, Lindsey!

01:00:35.357 --> 01:00:38.734
Lindsey, Lindsey!

01:00:40.107 --> 01:00:41.092
Dad?

01:00:43.488 --> 01:00:44.834
Dad!

01:00:50.368 --> 01:00:52.121
Lindsey!

01:00:59.378 --> 01:01:02.421
No!

01:01:04.428 --> 01:01:08.205
No! No! No!

01:01:08.808 --> 01:01:10.885
Damn you!
No!

01:01:21.229 --> 01:01:23.489
No!

01:01:24.609 --> 01:01:26.111
Lindsey...

01:01:30.239 --> 01:01:32.164
Lindsey!

01:01:32.399 --> 01:01:36.169
We've cleared the area,
come with us, you'll be safe.

01:02:43.691 --> 01:02:47.151
<i>Stop!</i>

01:04:43.894 --> 01:04:45.647
Chris!
Hey Meyer!

01:04:47.274 --> 01:04:50.854
You got through, I don't believe it.

01:04:50.944 --> 01:04:54.315
As for my team though...

01:04:54.405 --> 01:04:55.999
they weren't so lucky.

01:04:56.235 --> 01:04:57.346
Your daughter?

01:04:59.745 --> 01:05:03.996
Gone.  Taken.

01:05:04.835 --> 01:05:10.035
Well, you're here now.
If anyone can keep you safe, it's us.

01:05:12.635 --> 01:05:15.246
I don't think there
is a safe place anymore.

01:05:37.406 --> 01:05:38.856
You're still alive.

01:05:39.826 --> 01:05:41.048
I thought they'd killed you.

01:05:43.786 --> 01:05:45.212
What did they do to you?

01:05:45.866 --> 01:05:47.461
I know their plan.

01:05:48.286 --> 01:05:49.406
They showed you?

01:05:50.666 --> 01:05:52.272
She told me.

01:05:53.756 --> 01:05:56.910
- She?
- Your queen.

01:05:59.546 --> 01:06:04.047
She got into my head.
And she told me.

01:06:08.097 --> 01:06:11.197
They are a dying race.

01:06:12.577 --> 01:06:16.334
Going planet to planet
harvesting for her.

01:06:17.607 --> 01:06:19.577
Their last queen.

01:06:20.697 --> 01:06:23.827
And they're keeping her alive.

01:06:24.207 --> 01:06:25.588
Oh my God.

01:06:26.697 --> 01:06:29.627
I have seen their plan.

01:06:31.417 --> 01:06:33.271
And we're all going to die.

01:06:33.627 --> 01:06:36.377
No no no!
Don't lose hope.

01:06:36.457 --> 01:06:39.105
Look, I need you.
Look look look.

01:06:39.106 --> 01:06:41.203
We still have the beacon.
It should be charged now.

01:06:41.238 --> 01:06:44.728
We can contact Control.
Tell them to bring the fight here.

01:06:45.888 --> 01:06:48.041
Get these bastards where they live.

01:06:48.888 --> 01:06:50.162
How?

01:06:51.148 --> 01:06:53.507
Just stay strong with me.

01:07:05.278 --> 01:07:08.254
- Southard.
- Ah, Captain.

01:07:08.289 --> 01:07:13.555
- Are you all right?
- No, please tell me there's a plan.

01:07:13.590 --> 01:07:15.656
We're working on it.

01:07:16.088 --> 01:07:17.344
Oh!

01:07:19.339 --> 01:07:20.710
Oh!

01:08:27.640 --> 01:08:29.658
Kill good, you bastard!

01:08:34.291 --> 01:08:37.415
- James!
- Hang on!

01:08:37.421 --> 01:08:40.533
- Oh, it hurts!
- Gonna get you out of here.

01:08:42.171 --> 01:08:45.341
Oh, no, get out of here!

01:08:45.621 --> 01:08:48.658
Go! Get out of here!  Go!

01:08:48.791 --> 01:08:51.142
Oh God!

01:09:54.993 --> 01:09:59.107
Mission Control, this is Captain
James Wheeler, do you copy?  Over.

01:10:00.623 --> 01:10:04.500
Mission Control, this is Captain Wheeler.
Do you copy?

01:10:10.003 --> 01:10:15.604
I hope you're reading this.
We have encountered...

01:10:16.394 --> 01:10:19.664
...alien hostiles.

01:10:20.144 --> 01:10:26.404
And found that they are abducting humans
and bringing in to their home planet.

01:10:27.154 --> 01:10:32.164
There are several...
hundreds more in captivity.

01:10:34.694 --> 01:10:37.802
We found a way to travel through
one of their orb transports

01:10:37.803 --> 01:10:39.947
and I suggest you do the same.

01:10:41.784 --> 01:10:47.904
They are a dying, desperate race.

01:10:48.214 --> 01:10:50.585
There is still hope for
us to wipe them out.

01:10:52.135 --> 01:10:56.305
The asteroid is a launching dock.

01:10:57.135 --> 01:11:01.435
Fly to it and fire a nuke into the cave
near the tracking rods that we've marked.

01:11:01.515 --> 01:11:05.105
That will blast it from its core.

01:11:05.185 --> 01:11:07.105
My...

01:11:09.315 --> 01:11:12.515
My entire team, they died as heroes.

01:11:12.905 --> 01:11:15.409
Please, don't let
their deaths be in vain.

01:11:17.385 --> 01:11:19.325
You give 'em power

01:11:20.495 --> 01:11:22.866
and the best of luck to you all.

01:11:26.746 --> 01:11:32.346
If you are listening to this,
you are the resistance.

01:11:33.136 --> 01:11:35.210
Mankindâ€™s final hope.

01:11:37.716 --> 01:11:39.256
Over and out.

01:12:25.187 --> 01:12:26.661
They're coming.

01:12:27.347 --> 01:12:30.967
And they're gonna
wipe out your entire race!

01:12:35.277 --> 01:12:37.514
Chris! Chris!

01:12:37.777 --> 01:12:39.349
You gonna want to hear this.

01:12:49.708 --> 01:12:56.548
Soon, we'll be deploying the
greatest assault in our world's history.

01:12:56.628 --> 01:12:59.338
Against a threat like never before.

01:12:59.428 --> 01:13:01.737
Early this morning we
received a transmission

01:13:01.738 --> 01:13:04.423
from United States Marine
Captain James Wheeler.

01:13:04.468 --> 01:13:09.386
In it, he told us that they are
holding several civilians captive.

01:13:09.387 --> 01:13:10.830
Lindsey.

01:13:10.838 --> 01:13:13.729
But he also told us
how to fight them.

01:13:13.809 --> 01:13:15.861
Where we can take this
battle to their doorstep

01:13:15.862 --> 01:13:18.975
and make them wish that they
never stepped on to our planet.

01:13:19.069 --> 01:13:24.165
Captain Wheeler and his squad
gave their lives for this information.

01:13:24.659 --> 01:13:27.909
And now it's our turn
to honor their sacrifice.

01:13:27.999 --> 01:13:34.332
This isn't about politics, or national
interests or protecting resources.

01:13:34.367 --> 01:13:39.629
This is a struggle for
all mankind to survive.

01:13:39.709 --> 01:13:42.169
And we will!

01:13:42.259 --> 01:13:45.139
We will survive.

01:13:45.219 --> 01:13:47.969
Now and forever.

01:13:48.059 --> 01:13:54.610
And the universe will know
that this... this is our world!

01:14:01.740 --> 01:14:06.370
Two teams will fight simultaneously.
Assault and Rescue.

01:14:06.450 --> 01:14:10.290
Assault will be travelling to the
alien rock outside of our atmosphere.

01:14:10.370 --> 01:14:13.940
We will focus our attack on
the designated marked target.

01:14:14.020 --> 01:14:17.130
A clean shot should
blow it from its core.

01:14:17.210 --> 01:14:22.010
- As for Rescue... Colonel.
- We capture one of the alien craft.

01:14:22.090 --> 01:14:24.449
We'll take the civilians
via weaponized portal,

01:14:24.450 --> 01:14:27.632
immediately transporting them
back to their home planet.

01:14:27.667 --> 01:14:32.521
Rescue, you'll move heavily armed,
eliminating any hostiles on site...

01:14:32.611 --> 01:14:36.374
retrieve any civilians
back to the portal.

01:14:37.651 --> 01:14:42.281
Let's teach this brave new
world the meaning of fear.

01:14:49.991 --> 01:14:53.201
I'm trying, baby.

01:15:22.772 --> 01:15:23.752
Are you ready?

01:15:30.242 --> 01:15:32.262
Let's do this.

01:15:37.203 --> 01:15:40.242
Dad, will you help me?

01:15:40.543 --> 01:15:42.808
The SI 22's are fueled up and ready.

01:15:42.833 --> 01:15:45.463
Space.  It will be a new
part of experience for me.

01:15:45.543 --> 01:15:48.072
Don't get lost up there, Colonel.
We're counting on you.

01:15:48.073 --> 01:15:49.029
Yes, sir.

01:15:58.103 --> 01:16:03.153
Okay, I almost got it.
You might feel a tingling sensation.

01:16:16.914 --> 01:16:19.948
Eagle Star 1.  Fighters all in.
Locked on **.

01:16:20.049 --> 01:16:21.455
Roger!

01:16:27.694 --> 01:16:29.119
What the hell?

01:16:33.924 --> 01:16:36.576
- Anyone else coming?
- More coming.

01:16:37.344 --> 01:16:40.101
Let's get our bearings and
keep pushing forward.

01:17:04.165 --> 01:17:05.841
Looks like it up there.

01:17:11.125 --> 01:17:15.425
Okay, listen up.
We're heading to their compound.

01:17:15.505 --> 01:17:17.470
We're going in loud.
Heavy gunners,

01:17:17.471 --> 01:17:21.505
I want you blasting the living hell
out of everything that is inhuman.

01:17:21.515 --> 01:17:24.360
Ready?
Let's move up!

01:18:35.678 --> 01:18:37.311
They know we're coming.

01:18:40.678 --> 01:18:42.147
Come on.
Let's keep moving.

01:19:55.480 --> 01:19:58.352
Look out turning the left.
Go to the main entry.

01:22:06.263 --> 01:22:09.194
Enemy craft.  Enemy craft.
Fighters engage!

01:22:14.344 --> 01:22:17.764
Is that all you got?

01:22:19.434 --> 01:22:21.894
Lindsey! Lindsey!

01:22:21.984 --> 01:22:23.265
Dad!

01:22:24.484 --> 01:22:30.551
Oh, I found you, I found you!
Are you okay? Let me see you.

01:22:31.034 --> 01:22:33.784
- Dad, it was terrible.
- Oh I know, I'm so sorry.

01:22:34.664 --> 01:22:37.467
- Come on, we gotta go! Come on!
- Let's get you out of here. Come on.

01:22:47.835 --> 01:22:50.715
No!

01:23:02.065 --> 01:23:04.275
Lindsey!

01:23:06.315 --> 01:23:08.615
- Dad...
- Oh, God.

01:23:08.695 --> 01:23:10.049
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.

01:23:14.865 --> 01:23:18.035
- Dad.
- You gonna be okay.

01:23:18.115 --> 01:23:21.546
- Take me home, Dad.
- Okay.

01:23:21.626 --> 01:23:24.623
Okay baby. Stay with me.
Let's go home now.

01:23:30.716 --> 01:23:33.483
- I'm out!
- We're out of missiles!

01:23:33.926 --> 01:23:34.937
Damn!

01:23:37.556 --> 01:23:40.486
- Am I late?
- General Magowan?

01:23:40.636 --> 01:23:41.665
That's right.

01:23:42.746 --> 01:23:45.527
Get these guys off so
I can get a clean shot.

01:23:45.528 --> 01:23:48.480
You heard the General.
Evasive maneuvers, let's go.

01:23:55.036 --> 01:23:59.417
Target locked.
Welcome to oblivion.

01:24:01.577 --> 01:24:03.189
Fighters, pull back!

01:24:08.047 --> 01:24:11.390
- Excellent job, sir.
- My pleasure.

01:24:19.217 --> 01:24:22.687
Lindsey no!  Stay with me.
Open your eyes, baby. Open your eyes.

01:24:22.967 --> 01:24:26.017
No Lindsey, open your eyes,
Lindsey.  Stay with me!

01:25:27.289 --> 01:25:28.959
Dad.

01:25:29.039 --> 01:25:31.959
Please, it's over.

01:25:41.389 --> 01:25:44.100
Please...

01:25:47.140 --> 01:25:48.682
It's not.

01:25:52.730 --> 01:25:54.070
It's not over.

01:26:01.740 --> 01:26:03.755
Not yet.
