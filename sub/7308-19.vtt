00:04.086 --> 00:05.464
Do you like Mom's new boyfriend?

00:05.631 --> 00:07.508
- Haven't decided yet.
- l like him.

00:07.674 --> 00:09.927
You only like him
because he bought us PSPs.

00:10.093 --> 00:11.512
So you don't like him?

00:11.678 --> 00:13.388
l didn't say that. l'm just saying--

00:13.555 --> 00:15.349
l wouldn't be too nice to him.

00:15.516 --> 00:19.686
We play it cool, an Xbox could be
right around the corner.

00:20.437 --> 00:21.897
What's up?

00:22.064 --> 00:24.024
lt's already March, Sean.

00:24.191 --> 00:26.777
lt's still frozen, see?

00:26.944 --> 00:28.237
Come on.

00:28.403 --> 00:30.155
Oh, chicken.

00:43.126 --> 00:44.294
Who's the chicken now?

00:44.461 --> 00:45.921
l'm coming.

00:49.591 --> 00:51.718
Hurry up or l'm gonna tell Mom.

00:53.679 --> 00:54.763
Come on, Sean.

01:54.399 --> 01:59.195
Apricot oil, aloe vera, shea butter?

01:59.362 --> 02:01.823
l didn't know you were so interested
in skin care.

02:02.490 --> 02:04.450
Yeah, it's not mine. lt's McGee's.

02:04.659 --> 02:07.120
Maybe the probie is gay.

02:07.286 --> 02:09.038
l'm not gay, Tony.

02:09.205 --> 02:11.582
Are you saying there's something
wrong with being gay, Timothy?

02:11.749 --> 02:14.043
No, that is not what l am saying.

02:14.210 --> 02:15.294
Bi-curious.

02:15.920 --> 02:18.715
l suppose now you're gonna tell us
that a lot of your friends

02:18.881 --> 02:22.802
are of the homosexual persuasion
and that l should be more sensitive.

02:23.219 --> 02:26.264
No, actually, l was gonna tell you
to stay out of my desk.

02:26.431 --> 02:28.891
Right, because you wouldn't
want word spreading

02:29.058 --> 02:33.062
that you're ''deep moisturizing
to bring out your feminine glow.''

02:33.229 --> 02:34.814
l have dry skin, okay?

02:34.981 --> 02:36.733
My doctor recommended it.

02:39.569 --> 02:43.573
Well, you're walking
a slippery slope there, probilicious.

02:43.740 --> 02:46.659
Before you know it you're gonna be
taking bubble baths with your clogs on.

02:46.826 --> 02:48.327
What is wrong with bubble baths?

02:48.494 --> 02:49.871
Load up.

02:50.621 --> 02:52.331
Just got a break
in the Ryan Downing case.

02:52.498 --> 02:54.834
- Downing?
- Weapons company first sergeant.

02:55.001 --> 02:57.336
Went UA last November
on leave from lraq.

02:57.503 --> 02:59.505
Not a peep since.
What's the break, boss?

02:59.672 --> 03:01.090
Two kids found the first sergeant

03:01.257 --> 03:03.676
- floating under six inches of ice.
- lce? That means--

03:03.843 --> 03:07.305
You're now going to make
a really juvenile cold-case joke?

03:08.973 --> 03:11.350
lt was a really good one too.

03:12.060 --> 03:16.814
- Something wrong, boss?
- Just admiring your feminine glow.

03:19.067 --> 03:21.110
Can't say l'm disappointed
this one's yours.

03:21.819 --> 03:23.571
We'll leave the lights
if you guys return them.

03:24.280 --> 03:26.532
Hey, we've worked with NClS before.

03:26.699 --> 03:28.951
Okay, guys, up. Here we go.

03:29.118 --> 03:30.411
What do you got?

03:30.578 --> 03:33.164
Hopefully not pneumonia.

03:33.331 --> 03:35.041
That could be the death of me.

03:35.208 --> 03:36.959
l'm talking about the dead guy, Duck.

03:37.126 --> 03:38.795
Well, technically,
paramedics have a saying

03:38.961 --> 03:41.130
concerning cold-water drownings,
Agent Gibbs.

03:41.297 --> 03:44.675
They say the victim isn't dead
until he's warm and dead.

03:44.842 --> 03:48.054
l think we can make an exception
in this case, Mr. Palmer.

03:48.221 --> 03:49.263
Not a drowning.

03:49.430 --> 03:51.307
This pond's barely six feet deep.

03:51.474 --> 03:55.353
Yes, l once conducted an autopsy on a
man who drowned in his kitchen sink.

03:56.437 --> 03:59.148
Yes, apparently he couldn't loosen
the drain plug

03:59.315 --> 04:00.691
and he attempted to use his teeth.

04:00.858 --> 04:01.901
Thought you were cold.

04:02.860 --> 04:06.906
Yes, well, it will be impossible
to determine the exact cause of death

04:07.073 --> 04:09.367
until he thaws.

04:09.867 --> 04:14.163
These three holes in his coat
could be crucial.

04:14.330 --> 04:15.790
How about time of death?

04:15.957 --> 04:18.918
Yeah, well decomposition
suggests, well,

04:19.084 --> 04:22.171
- anywhere from two weeks to--
- Four months.

04:22.338 --> 04:26.592
Depending on how many times
the pond has thawed out this winter.

04:26.759 --> 04:28.678
- Very good, Mr. Palmer.
- Thank you.

04:28.845 --> 04:32.098
Of course, l'll have to check
the meteorological data for the area

04:32.265 --> 04:34.016
before we speculate further.

04:34.434 --> 04:36.436
Let's strap him up.

04:36.602 --> 04:40.022
l'm just saying, probie, the whole
metrosexual thing isn't working for you.

04:40.189 --> 04:43.276
- l got it, Tony. Joke is over.
- l'm not joking, man.

04:43.443 --> 04:46.237
We all know that the ladies
love a macho man

04:46.404 --> 04:47.864
who's in touch
with his feminine side.

04:48.030 --> 04:52.910
But l gotta tell you,
l think you're coming off a little gay.

04:53.077 --> 04:55.079
Because he uses body lotion

04:55.246 --> 04:57.915
- and likes to take bubble baths?
- Did you forget the manicure?

04:58.374 --> 05:01.544
The manicure was only once
and it was because l tore a cuticle.

05:01.711 --> 05:04.881
You just set off gaydar
across the entire Atlantic seaboard.

05:05.048 --> 05:06.549
Tony, l am not gay.

05:06.716 --> 05:08.384
This isn't about orientation.

05:08.551 --> 05:11.596
- This is about image.
- So now your image is homo-pubic?

05:11.763 --> 05:13.931
The term is ''homophobic.'' And no.

05:14.098 --> 05:16.517
Prejudice of any kind
is an ugly thing.

05:16.684 --> 05:20.313
Listen, girls like guys who like guys
but they like guys who like guys--

05:20.480 --> 05:22.148
- No, Tony, back it up.
- l know.

05:22.315 --> 05:23.691
lt's thick soup here, man.

05:23.658 --> 05:25.201
The flashlight. Back it up.

05:26.035 --> 05:28.079
What? Tree branch?

05:35.086 --> 05:37.213
Wearing a steel-toed boot?

05:38.715 --> 05:40.675
- Eagle eye, boss.
- Mark it.

05:40.842 --> 05:42.635
Got another one.

05:42.802 --> 05:44.929
These things always come in threes.

05:45.096 --> 05:46.973
Already got three, DiNozzo.

05:48.224 --> 05:50.143
Make it four.

06:00.236 --> 06:02.906
l supposed a ''bless you''
is too much to ask for.

06:03.072 --> 06:04.991
Oh, bless you, doctor.

06:05.408 --> 06:07.744
l wasn't talking to you, Mr. Palmer.

06:07.911 --> 06:12.081
You know, the interesting thing
about the sternutatory reflex

06:12.248 --> 06:15.251
is that no one knows exactly
when it first began.

06:15.418 --> 06:17.045
Many theories abound.

06:17.212 --> 06:19.047
And you know them all don't you,
Dr. Mallard?

06:19.214 --> 06:22.592
Know them? l once wrote a sonnet
on the subject for an old flame.

06:22.759 --> 06:25.678
She suffered from
the most horrendous allergies.

06:25.845 --> 06:27.764
Yes, how did it go?

06:28.431 --> 06:31.768
- ''Doth thy heart skip a beat--''
- l'm not a big fan of poetry, Duck.

06:31.935 --> 06:35.313
Well, as it turned out,
neither was she. ln fact--

06:35.480 --> 06:37.273
- Why am l here?
- Why?

06:37.440 --> 06:41.402
- Why am l here?
- You were correct earlier on, Jethro.

06:41.569 --> 06:44.280
Our first sergeant didn't drown.

06:44.447 --> 06:47.116
- None of our bodies did.
- They were all shot.

06:47.283 --> 06:50.328
First Sergeant Downing received
the most damage.

06:50.495 --> 06:51.955
Three in the chest.

06:52.664 --> 06:55.166
Here, here and here.

06:55.333 --> 06:57.168
And one to the back,
just below the heart.

06:57.335 --> 06:58.461
That's the kill shot.

06:58.628 --> 07:01.840
Yes, well it ruptured
his inferior vena cava.

07:02.298 --> 07:06.928
As to our walking pictograms,
one bullet each.

07:07.095 --> 07:10.431
- Are these gang tats?
- That's not my field of expertise.

07:10.598 --> 07:14.978
But l've had Mr. Palmer document
the entire line for further investigation.

07:15.144 --> 07:18.022
Some of them were quite explicit.

07:18.189 --> 07:23.027
Jethro, this young man was shot
in the front, just below the left clavicle.

07:23.194 --> 07:24.863
And this young man...

07:26.364 --> 07:27.907
...was shot in the back.

07:28.533 --> 07:30.076
This young man...

07:31.744 --> 07:35.373
...was also shot in the back
like our first sergeant.

07:35.540 --> 07:37.125
Back, front. Front, back.

07:37.876 --> 07:39.377
The pattern is quite random.

07:39.544 --> 07:44.174
- l believe the phrase is ''turkey shoot.''
- More like massacre.

07:44.340 --> 07:45.675
<i>Definitely gang tats.</i>

07:47.802 --> 07:49.053
How can you be sure?

07:49.637 --> 07:51.014
Just a feeling.

07:51.181 --> 07:52.807
l'm sure you know
what those are like.

07:52.974 --> 07:54.225
Feeling, DiNozzo?

07:54.392 --> 07:56.728
That, and l faxed a copy to a buddy
at the Baltimore P.D.

07:56.895 --> 07:59.230
He's sending the intel
that he's got back.

07:59.397 --> 08:00.773
What do you got?

08:00.940 --> 08:03.443
l have got an upper limit
on the time frame.

08:09.699 --> 08:11.409
lt's an ATM receipt.

08:11.576 --> 08:14.120
lt used to be an ATM receipt.
The ink's washed off,

08:14.287 --> 08:16.456
but the dimensions
matched the receipt paper used

08:16.623 --> 08:18.583
by Sergeant Downing's bank.
l checked his records.

08:18.750 --> 08:20.752
Last withdrawal November 1 8th.

08:20.919 --> 08:23.838
- The day he was reported missing.
- No lD on the other ice cubes yet.

08:24.005 --> 08:28.259
But the dredge team did find
a weapon. H.P. Browning.

08:28.426 --> 08:29.928
- Ziva brought it down to Abby.
- Brass.

08:30.094 --> 08:31.846
Nothing. lt's pretty far off
the beaten track,

08:32.013 --> 08:33.640
about 500 metres
from the nearest main road.

08:33.806 --> 08:35.808
- You know what that means.
- The bodies were dumped.

08:35.975 --> 08:37.936
- By who?
- That's a good question, McGee.

08:38.102 --> 08:39.770
Why don't you find me an answer?

08:39.938 --> 08:42.023
Good question. Find me an answer.

08:43.982 --> 08:47.153
Okay, if you slide your heel further
back it'll decrease your exposure.

08:47.570 --> 08:49.447
Won't that throw off
my lateral balance?

08:49.614 --> 08:53.034
Balance isn't usually
the primary concern on a mission.

08:53.201 --> 08:55.912
- What is?
- The guy shooting back.

08:56.079 --> 08:58.706
Which is what l'm gonna do
if you two don't get back to work.

08:58.873 --> 09:01.251
Gibbs, l was the one waiting for you.

09:01.417 --> 09:02.794
What are you waiting for now, Abs?

09:04.170 --> 09:05.964
l ran ballistics on the Browning.

09:06.130 --> 09:08.675
Rifling patterns indicate
it didn't fire any of the slugs

09:08.842 --> 09:10.635
Ducky pulled from the first sergeant.

09:10.802 --> 09:13.555
Three 9 mm Parabellums
and a .45.

09:13.721 --> 09:16.933
Which means Downing was shot by
at least two unaccounted for weapons.

09:17.100 --> 09:19.644
- l got that part.
- The dredge crew is still looking.

09:19.811 --> 09:21.855
Hopefully more weapons
will turn up.

09:22.021 --> 09:23.273
The good news is

09:23.439 --> 09:27.277
l matched the Browning to the slugs
pulled from the other three victims.

09:27.443 --> 09:29.237
- Any prints?
- No, not by a long shot.

09:29.404 --> 09:32.282
And GSR would be pointless because
it's been underwater for so long.

09:32.448 --> 09:34.576
But l did run the serial number.

09:34.742 --> 09:39.164
The gun is registered
to First Sergeant Ryan Downing.

09:39.789 --> 09:42.125
Looks like he went down fighting
for his life.

09:42.292 --> 09:44.252
Or committed triple homicide.

09:52.553 --> 09:55.347
MTAC, are you receiving
my video feed now?

09:55.514 --> 09:58.475
Yeah, coming through.

09:58.642 --> 10:02.062
- Which kid are we talking about here?
- Should be on your main screen.

10:04.231 --> 10:05.482
Jethro.

10:05.649 --> 10:07.693
The three bodies found
with First Sergeant Downing--

10:07.860 --> 10:11.488
Were killed with his personal weapon.
l heard.

10:17.035 --> 10:20.122
- Where are your glasses?
- Oh, l forgot them.

10:25.043 --> 10:26.837
l don't like what it says either.

10:27.004 --> 10:29.298
First Sergeants don't go looking
for this kind of payback.

10:29.715 --> 10:31.592
- You would.
- l was only a gunny.

10:32.593 --> 10:35.262
The Marine Corps is worried
his company is gonna come back

10:35.429 --> 10:37.181
from lraq and look for revenge.

10:37.347 --> 10:38.766
lt could be a bloodbath.

10:46.064 --> 10:47.691
How do you drink that swill?

10:48.567 --> 10:50.194
How much time do l have?

10:50.360 --> 10:51.987
They were to return this week.

10:52.154 --> 10:53.280
Were?

10:53.447 --> 10:56.492
Their rotation's been held up
till your investigation's over.

10:56.658 --> 10:59.745
They're still in a war zone
instead of with their families, Jethro.

10:59.912 --> 11:03.499
l don't care if First Sergeant Downing
killed those gang-bangers.

11:03.665 --> 11:05.626
lf he didn't, find out who did.

11:05.793 --> 11:07.211
lf he did, close the case.

11:08.253 --> 11:10.506
You're wrong, Jenny.

11:11.965 --> 11:13.967
You do care.

11:17.805 --> 11:20.224
Ziva, if l ask you a question,
you'll be honest with me, right?

11:20.390 --> 11:22.392
Of course, McGee.

11:24.478 --> 11:28.816
What Tony was saying
about me before, you know....

11:29.233 --> 11:31.318
Do l come off as unmanly?

11:32.069 --> 11:33.987
l think Tony was jerking your brain.

11:34.905 --> 11:36.990
Chain? Jerking my chain?

11:37.157 --> 11:39.743
Whatever. l think you are
appropriately masculine.

11:42.287 --> 11:44.665
However, perhaps not macho.

11:45.499 --> 11:48.919
Tony and Gibbs are tough guys, yes?
They're--

11:49.086 --> 11:51.422
So l'm not tough?

11:51.588 --> 11:52.923
lf you have to ask....

11:53.090 --> 11:54.758
These the other victims?

11:55.259 --> 11:58.804
Alejandro Marquez, Jorge Rubio,
and Hector ''The Hammer'' Menendez.

11:58.971 --> 12:01.432
All members of the L.V.M.

12:01.598 --> 12:04.268
- L.V.M., boss, that stands for--
- La Vida Mala.

12:04.435 --> 12:07.229
- El Salvadorian street gang.
- Not just a street gang, Gibbs.

12:07.396 --> 12:09.731
They have 30,000 members
worldwide.

12:09.898 --> 12:11.191
They deal drugs, run guns.

12:11.358 --> 12:12.901
They also hire themselves out
as hit men.

12:13.068 --> 12:16.738
Which is what two of their members
were allegedly doing a year ago,

12:16.905 --> 12:19.616
when they mistakenly shot
a Private First Class--

12:19.783 --> 12:23.704
Martin Reggio. A Marine from
First Sergeant Downing's company.

12:23.871 --> 12:27.040
- We couldn't prove it.
- Downing was on a revenge mission.

12:27.207 --> 12:30.794
First sergeants don't go
on revenge missions, Officer David.

12:30.961 --> 12:33.130
l would.
Why not a Marine first sergeant?

12:33.297 --> 12:34.965
They have more control than you do.

12:35.132 --> 12:37.968
Do either one of you have
anything new to offer to this?

12:38.135 --> 12:39.344
Yeah, boss. l think l do.

12:39.511 --> 12:42.014
These three here,
they weren't just members of L.V.M.

12:42.181 --> 12:43.807
According to the FBl here,

12:43.974 --> 12:46.310
they are all lieutenants
in L.V.M.'s Manassas chapter.

12:46.477 --> 12:48.479
- The boss?
- Miguel Sosa.

12:51.774 --> 12:53.650
- Why are we standing here?
- He's missing.

12:53.817 --> 12:56.236
He's been MlA since these three
disappeared a few months ago.

12:56.403 --> 12:58.781
Let's go meet his replacement.
DiNozzo!

12:58.947 --> 13:00.324
Where the hell have you been?

13:00.491 --> 13:02.993
l come bearing gifts.

13:03.827 --> 13:06.413
Spent the night
at Rock Creek Park

13:06.580 --> 13:11.001
and l found these
when they drained the pond.

13:11.502 --> 13:14.505
Oh, that's a big one.

13:16.048 --> 13:20.344
- Were you expecting an attaboy?
- l thought it would be nice.

13:20.511 --> 13:22.179
Attaboy.

13:23.138 --> 13:25.182
- l was just doing my job, boss.
- l know that.

13:35.734 --> 13:38.946
You wouldn't think it's the headquarters
of a worldwide crime syndicate.

13:39.113 --> 13:40.239
What did you expect, McGee?

13:40.405 --> 13:41.990
Corporate headquarters building?

13:46.745 --> 13:48.914
- They're all armed.
- Keep your eyes open.

13:49.081 --> 13:50.416
Spread out.

13:54.753 --> 13:56.588
<i>Who's el jefe?</i>

14:01.552 --> 14:03.762
You are, officer.

14:03.929 --> 14:05.597
Hey.

14:08.225 --> 14:10.436
We're not local cops.

14:10.602 --> 14:11.937
We're federal agents.

14:17.568 --> 14:19.611
- Who's in charge?
- ln charge?

14:20.571 --> 14:22.281
ln charge of what?

14:22.448 --> 14:24.616
The Manassas chapter
of La Vida Mala.

14:31.457 --> 14:32.958
lnside.

14:40.466 --> 14:43.385
You're either DEA or lmmigration.

14:43.552 --> 14:46.722
You're not FBl. They wear suits.

14:47.347 --> 14:48.474
NClS.

14:50.726 --> 14:52.394
Navy cops.

14:54.396 --> 14:56.482
What did we do to piss you off?

14:57.733 --> 14:59.151
Come on, man.

14:59.318 --> 15:01.278
We get blamed
for everything these days.

15:01.445 --> 15:03.280
Help me out.

15:03.447 --> 15:07.785
<i>- We steal the admiral's car?
- Or his calzoncillos?</i>

15:08.994 --> 15:11.246
You killed two Marines.

15:11.413 --> 15:14.666
The first in a drive-by shooting,
the other in Rock Creek Park.

15:17.878 --> 15:19.505
Take me away.

15:19.671 --> 15:21.590
You want one of them instead?

15:21.757 --> 15:23.842
<i>Go with the federales.</i>

15:24.009 --> 15:25.636
They need a suspect.

15:25.803 --> 15:27.930
We know who did it.

15:33.477 --> 15:35.104
You can keep those.

15:37.147 --> 15:39.817
Don't look surprised.

15:40.859 --> 15:42.653
l never seen them before.

15:42.820 --> 15:44.321
They used to run your organization.

15:44.488 --> 15:45.906
Organization?

15:48.033 --> 15:49.701
We're a social club.

15:53.789 --> 15:55.374
<i>You're not el jefe.</i>

15:56.375 --> 15:59.336
No? Who am l?

16:02.297 --> 16:04.383
<i>El Gordo.</i>

16:07.386 --> 16:11.473
See? Nobody laughs at the boss.

16:12.641 --> 16:15.477
<i>You have el jefe give me a call,</i>

16:15.644 --> 16:19.189
or l book him the next seat
on the flight to Gitmo.

16:19.356 --> 16:21.859
You can't do that.
We're not terrorists.

16:22.734 --> 16:25.529
- Ziva.
- l'll have Tel Aviv produce an intercept

16:25.696 --> 16:28.449
between Al Qaeda
and this social club.

16:28.615 --> 16:30.868
- You want photos?
- That would be good.

16:31.034 --> 16:34.204
- lt might take me 24 hours.
- Okay.

16:34.371 --> 16:35.581
Twenty-four hours.

16:45.090 --> 16:47.926
Get a surveillance team
on this taco shack.

16:48.093 --> 16:50.012
<i>Actually, it's a pupusa shack, boss.</i>

16:50.179 --> 16:53.474
- l'm just saying, tacos are historically--
- Ziva, you make sure they're visible.

16:53.640 --> 16:55.350
Okay, McGee,
you come back here.

16:55.517 --> 16:58.228
You pick up anybody
who's got a La Vida Mala clown tat.

16:58.395 --> 17:00.773
- What for, exactly?
- l don't care, McGee.

17:00.939 --> 17:02.900
Driving around the block.
l don't care, McGee.

17:03.066 --> 17:04.358
Okay, you want us
to shake them up.

17:04.526 --> 17:06.111
lf they're worried
we're on to something

17:06.278 --> 17:07.780
they'll start talking to each other.

17:07.945 --> 17:11.282
Get me intercepts on their cell phones,
computers, pagers, smoke signals,

17:11.450 --> 17:12.617
any way they communicate.

17:12.785 --> 17:14.286
How are we gonna get
a judge to sign?

17:14.453 --> 17:15.954
Didn't you hear, McGee?

17:16.121 --> 17:18.207
La Vida Mala has ties to Al Qaeda.

17:18.790 --> 17:21.292
Well, yeah,
but weren't we just saying that--?

17:23.753 --> 17:25.672
Unbelievable.

17:31.261 --> 17:32.763
Heard you rumbled with the sharks.

17:32.930 --> 17:35.516
- The sharks?
- You know:

17:37.101 --> 17:40.604
<i>- West Side Story.
- Yes, McGee was quite impressive.</i>

17:40.771 --> 17:42.147
You didn't threaten them, did you?

17:43.023 --> 17:44.316
Sort of.

17:44.483 --> 17:47.736
l had a buddy on the Baltimore
gang unit, did that to the local L.V.M.

17:47.903 --> 17:50.155
They found his head
in Crawford Park.

17:50.322 --> 17:52.157
Never did find the rest of him.

17:52.324 --> 17:54.993
- Think l'd lie to you?
- Yes.

17:55.160 --> 17:57.454
To McGee l would lie.
Never to you, sir. Never to you.

17:57.621 --> 17:59.832
Look out. Look out.

18:01.750 --> 18:02.918
l hope you've earned this.

18:03.669 --> 18:05.796
Oh, the director already
hooked me up.

18:06.922 --> 18:09.591
She wanted an update.
But l didn't tell her anything, l swear.

18:09.758 --> 18:12.719
She's been on her phone
since she got here.

18:13.971 --> 18:15.180
Oh, that's mature.

18:15.347 --> 18:16.849
You have something for me?

18:17.015 --> 18:19.518
As a matter of fact, l do.

18:19.685 --> 18:21.353
You looking over my shoulder again,
director?

18:21.520 --> 18:23.939
- Why? You feel a little crowded?
- Yeah, a little.

18:27.151 --> 18:29.695
- How's that?
- Better.

18:30.320 --> 18:33.490
These are the four rounds taken
from First Sergeant Downing's body.

18:34.366 --> 18:37.703
Three 9 mm Parabellum
and one .45.

18:37.870 --> 18:39.872
l matched the .45 to the Colt.
That's a no-brainer.

18:40.038 --> 18:42.207
The nine-millimetres are trickier.

18:42.374 --> 18:45.335
But l got a definite match
on the Beretta and the TEC-9.

18:45.502 --> 18:47.963
That leaves us with this final round.

18:48.130 --> 18:50.924
The runt of the litter.
Ducky said it went in through the back

18:51.091 --> 18:53.927
- and lodged in the chest plate.
- Kill shot.

18:54.094 --> 18:56.054
The rifling was almost stripped.

18:56.221 --> 18:59.808
lt made it almost impossible
to find out which weapon it came from.

18:59.975 --> 19:03.437
- But l did it.
- Which one was it?

19:03.604 --> 19:04.855
Neither.

19:05.022 --> 19:07.065
We're missing a weapon.

19:08.108 --> 19:10.444
Then we're missing a shooter.

19:16.626 --> 19:18.962
<i>l understand you got a job to do,
Agent Gibbs.</i>

19:19.129 --> 19:22.090
<i>My Marines have done theirs.
lt's time for them to come home.</i>

19:22.757 --> 19:26.011
<i>- l agree, captain.
- Why is my company still in lraq?</i>

19:26.177 --> 19:29.764
You lost two Marines to
a Virginia street gang, skipper.

19:29.931 --> 19:32.726
Would you like me
to spell it out for you?

19:33.602 --> 19:36.396
<i>Headquarters is afraid of reprisals.</i>

19:36.563 --> 19:38.565
Not only headquarters.

19:38.732 --> 19:41.401
PFC Reggio was killed
in a drive-by shooting

19:41.568 --> 19:43.486
one week before your deployment.

19:43.987 --> 19:46.156
Now your first sergeant
turns up dead?

19:46.323 --> 19:49.075
<i>You think First Sergeant Downing
was out for revenge?</i>

19:49.242 --> 19:53.580
His body was found in a frozen pond
with three dead gang-bangers.

19:53.747 --> 19:57.000
His weapon was used to kill them.
You tell me, captain.

19:59.252 --> 20:02.047
<i>No way. Not his style, Agent Gibbs.</i>

20:02.214 --> 20:04.424
What was he doing back
on leave in the States?

20:04.591 --> 20:06.509
<i>His father had cancer. Terminal.</i>

20:07.052 --> 20:09.304
<i>He wanted a chance
to say goodbye.</i>

20:09.763 --> 20:12.224
l hope he got it.

20:12.390 --> 20:14.267
He was shot four times.

20:14.434 --> 20:16.645
Kill shot was in his back.

20:16.978 --> 20:18.271
<i>You're a Marine.</i>

20:18.438 --> 20:21.107
<i>Do you know any first sergeants
that would leave their men in combat</i>

20:21.274 --> 20:23.151
<i>to go chase after
some street punks?</i>

20:23.318 --> 20:24.903
No, skipper. l don't.

20:25.070 --> 20:26.279
<i>Neither do l.</i>

20:27.822 --> 20:29.491
<i>What are you gonna do
about it?</i>

20:29.658 --> 20:31.368
We're working on the case
on this end.

20:31.534 --> 20:34.246
<i>- As soon as l know, you'll know.
- Sir!</i>

20:34.412 --> 20:37.666
<i>You people had a year to catch
Reggio's killers and you didn't do it!</i>

20:37.832 --> 20:39.251
<i>At ease, Lance Corporal Silva.</i>

20:39.417 --> 20:42.754
<i>- But, sir.
- At ease, Marine.</i>

20:44.005 --> 20:45.382
<i>Sorry, sir.</i>

20:45.849 --> 20:47.517
<i>- l didn't mean to--
- Your watch is over.</i>

20:47.684 --> 20:49.602
<i>- We'll talk about this later.
- Yes, sir.</i>

20:49.769 --> 20:53.565
<i>l got 1 82 other Marines wondering
the same thing, Agent Gibbs.</i>

20:53.731 --> 20:56.442
<i>Don't let them down this time.</i>

21:01.281 --> 21:03.408
You looking over my shoulder again,
Jen?

21:03.825 --> 21:05.577
Not exactly.

21:06.327 --> 21:07.745
He's right, you know.

21:08.538 --> 21:10.874
You can't let them down.

21:11.583 --> 21:13.084
<i>El Gordo's cell phone again.</i>

21:14.252 --> 21:16.546
<i>Probably his mamacita.</i>

21:20.508 --> 21:22.552
For a gangster,
this guy leads a pretty boring life.

21:30.351 --> 21:33.980
Welcome to the wonderful world
of Tomas Zepeda.

21:34.147 --> 21:36.065
He's all yours.
Kill the speaker phone.

21:39.652 --> 21:41.779
They are exchanging greetings.

21:42.822 --> 21:45.200
The plan for lunch.

21:45.366 --> 21:48.494
Oh, and a double feature is scheduled.

21:48.661 --> 21:50.622
- Movies?
- Nope.

21:51.164 --> 21:56.419
Two ho's are coming over
for something called a rainbow party.

21:56.586 --> 21:58.755
- Rainbow--
- lt's tough to translate slang.

21:58.922 --> 22:01.633
<i>- lt's my speciality. l'll take over.
- l know my cholo from my chile.</i>

22:01.799 --> 22:04.844
l'll give you the summary.
l'll give you the summary.

22:08.056 --> 22:10.600
ls that man-lotion
working for you there, probie?

22:10.767 --> 22:12.810
l didn't shave today.

22:12.977 --> 22:14.854
l'm trying a new look.

22:15.021 --> 22:18.066
When you say today, you mean
the last couple of minutes or...?

22:18.233 --> 22:20.151
Abby seems to like it.

22:20.860 --> 22:23.196
- Like what?
- lt looks nice, McGee.

22:23.363 --> 22:25.323
lt's very manly.

22:25.490 --> 22:27.033
May l?

22:28.868 --> 22:30.745
DiNozzo.

22:31.746 --> 22:34.040
- Hey, boss.
- Why are you touching his face?

22:34.207 --> 22:36.251
l don't know. lt feels good,
like a bunny rabbit.

22:36.417 --> 22:38.419
- Don't.
- Sorry.

22:38.586 --> 22:40.630
What are the wiretaps telling us?

22:40.797 --> 22:42.340
Not much.

22:42.507 --> 22:48.096
Zepeda, the big guy,
U.S. citizen, made five calls today.

22:48.263 --> 22:52.016
Twice to his mother, two for food,
and one just now concerning--

22:52.183 --> 22:56.354
- Ho's. Slang for--
- l know what it's slang for, Ziva.

22:56.521 --> 22:59.983
The rest of the gang's conversations
are even less promising.

23:00.149 --> 23:03.319
The only member we've been
unable to listen to is Cesar Bernal.

23:04.070 --> 23:05.363
Almost invisible, boss.

23:05.530 --> 23:08.324
- Almost, McGee?
- He never talks on the phone.

23:08.491 --> 23:12.287
Only sends and receives
text messages.

23:12.704 --> 23:14.038
Twenty-two since yesterday.

23:14.205 --> 23:16.249
All of them from Miguel Sosa
in San Salvador.

23:17.292 --> 23:20.837
Texts are coded, but it looks
as though Sosa's still making

23:21.004 --> 23:23.047
the day-to-day decisions
for the gang.

23:23.214 --> 23:24.757
Then Bernal is his number two.

23:24.924 --> 23:26.467
- Tony, get him in here.
- On it, boss.

23:26.634 --> 23:28.720
Use your contacts.
Find out everything about Sosa

23:28.887 --> 23:31.306
- and what he's doing in El Salvador.
- Done.

23:33.474 --> 23:35.602
- McGee?
- Yeah.

23:38.104 --> 23:40.106
You're trying too hard.

23:40.440 --> 23:41.941
On it.

23:51.284 --> 23:53.077
Your friend Zepeda's a chump.

23:53.244 --> 23:56.748
You're probably right.
Zepeda's an idiot.

23:56.915 --> 23:59.375
But last l heard,
being stupid wasn't illegal.

23:59.542 --> 24:01.753
l'm more interested
in who killed my first sergeant.

24:01.920 --> 24:04.297
<i>You're talking to the wrong cholo,
senor.</i>

24:04.464 --> 24:06.174
l'm just a small fish.

24:06.716 --> 24:09.344
<i>- Talk to the jefe.
- l would.</i>

24:10.345 --> 24:12.347
But l can't type.

24:13.306 --> 24:15.141
How about you?

24:17.060 --> 24:18.353
Why?

24:18.520 --> 24:21.105
Do you want to hire me
as your secretary or something?

24:21.272 --> 24:22.815
No. No, because l can't pay you

24:22.982 --> 24:26.486
as well as your current employer,
Miguel Sosa. No, l can't do that.

24:27.278 --> 24:29.155
You tell him
l wanna speak with him.

24:31.866 --> 24:35.161
l delivered your Gitmo threat.

24:35.995 --> 24:40.875
Sosa said to ask you why you let
your people live so far from work.

24:41.042 --> 24:46.756
<i>That vato McGee, and the lsraeli
chica, all the way out in Silver Spring?</i>

24:46.923 --> 24:48.466
<i>A long way, si?</i>

24:48.633 --> 24:50.510
What if they need you pronto?

24:51.094 --> 24:54.389
Threatening my people
is never a good idea.

24:54.556 --> 24:56.182
l'm just the messenger.

24:56.349 --> 24:59.018
A messenger that knows
what happened at Rock Creek Park.

24:59.894 --> 25:01.688
<i>Estoy muerto if l talk to you.</i>

25:01.855 --> 25:05.400
<i>Estas muerto if you don't.</i>

25:07.402 --> 25:12.949
Two Marines called Sosa
to help unload captured lraqi weapons.

25:13.116 --> 25:15.243
Two Marines?

25:17.704 --> 25:20.665
He sent our people to do a deal.

25:20.832 --> 25:23.960
Figured maybe the Marines
would back off, for,

25:24.127 --> 25:26.671
you know, what happened before.

25:26.838 --> 25:28.673
Who was the other Marine?

25:29.507 --> 25:31.426
They don't invite me to these things.

25:31.593 --> 25:34.387
l'm just a messenger.

25:34.846 --> 25:36.306
l don't know.

25:38.933 --> 25:41.019
Three Marines from the company
were on leave

25:41.186 --> 25:42.770
at the same time
as First Sergeant Downing.

25:42.937 --> 25:45.315
Of those three,
two were nowhere near D.C.

25:45.481 --> 25:48.568
Which leaves
Lance Corporal Jose Silva.

25:48.735 --> 25:50.695
Juvenile record, suspected
pre-Corps gang activity.

25:50.862 --> 25:53.281
He was also with PFC Reggio
the night he was murdered.

25:53.448 --> 25:56.576
l want him on a plane. Yesterday.

26:06.169 --> 26:08.630
Timothy, l suppose you're here
for the DOD?

26:08.796 --> 26:09.964
Department of Defence?

26:10.131 --> 26:12.550
- No, no. Date of death.
- Yes.

26:12.717 --> 26:14.886
Absence of larvae
from airborne insects

26:15.053 --> 26:18.431
indicate the bodies were thrown
into the water soon after death,

26:18.598 --> 26:22.268
and were immersed for months
based on the presence of adipocere,

26:22.435 --> 26:24.437
otherwise known as mortuary fat.

26:24.604 --> 26:26.940
The first sergeant was stateside
on leave from mid-November.

26:27.106 --> 26:29.609
The meteorological reports
from the area

26:29.776 --> 26:33.196
indicate that the first hard freeze
was December 9th.

26:33.363 --> 26:36.574
ls that aftershave l smell?

26:36.741 --> 26:39.661
Old Spice. l had to shave midday.

26:39.827 --> 26:44.040
Yes, l've heard about your infatuation
with lotions.

26:44.207 --> 26:46.876
The lotions were--
lt was for a skin condition.

26:47.043 --> 26:48.920
Oh, it's quite all right, Timothy.

26:49.087 --> 26:53.049
Skin care is something
we should all take more seriously.

26:53.216 --> 26:56.678
ln my opinion,
there's absolutely nothing gay about it.

26:56.845 --> 27:01.266
Not that there's anything wrong
with that.

27:01.432 --> 27:03.268
l've heard.

27:03.434 --> 27:05.645
So a hard freeze December 9th?

27:05.812 --> 27:10.567
Our key is that the bodies
were not frozen inside the ice,

27:10.733 --> 27:12.068
but were below it.

27:12.235 --> 27:13.403
So they died after the 9th?

27:13.570 --> 27:16.155
No, no, no. No, human bodies sink

27:16.322 --> 27:19.158
until the gases created
by the internal putrefaction

27:19.325 --> 27:21.119
have had time to accumulate.

27:21.286 --> 27:22.328
How long does that take?

27:22.195 --> 27:25.240
Under the forecasted
weather conditions, ten to 1 4 days.

27:25.699 --> 27:28.868
Bodies went into the water between
November 25th and December 9th

27:29.035 --> 27:31.663
or they would have resurfaced and
ice would have formed around them.

27:31.830 --> 27:33.290
Precisely.

27:33.456 --> 27:36.543
Have we any idea what our Marine
was doing there yet?

27:36.710 --> 27:40.714
No, Duck, l don't. But we're gonna
find out in 1 1 hours and 30 minutes.

27:40.881 --> 27:42.299
Hey.

27:48.221 --> 27:52.017
- How was the flight, lance corporal?
- lt was long, sir.

27:56.438 --> 27:58.231
- How much trouble am l in?
- Trouble?

27:58.398 --> 27:59.774
Why would you say that?

27:59.941 --> 28:02.611
Four NClS agents
escorting one lance corporal?

28:02.777 --> 28:05.405
You got it all wrong, Marine.
She's Mossad.

28:13.705 --> 28:16.750
l hope you slept on the plane,
lance corporal.

28:16.917 --> 28:19.294
Yeah. lt's gonna be a long night.

28:19.461 --> 28:21.713
You wanna get the cash first
or the lraqi weapons?

28:27.844 --> 28:31.139
- l'm not scaring you, am l?
- l'm fine.

28:32.432 --> 28:34.517
l don't know
what you're talking about, sir.

28:34.976 --> 28:38.730
Really? Because you were on leave
with First Sergeant Downing.

28:39.356 --> 28:40.982
Then you were with PFC Reggio

28:41.149 --> 28:44.194
the night he was killed
in the drive-by shooting.

28:44.361 --> 28:46.905
- l can't help a coincidence.
- A coincidence, lance corporal?

28:47.072 --> 28:49.449
Five dead bodies.
You're our only link.

28:52.077 --> 28:55.121
Your company,
your fellow Marines, are stuck in lraq

28:55.288 --> 28:56.998
until we solve this case.

28:57.165 --> 28:59.793
- You don't think l know that?
- He knows. He just doesn't care.

28:59.960 --> 29:01.253
Hey, Silva, you know what?

29:01.419 --> 29:05.632
We had a name for guys like you
when l was on active duty.

29:05.840 --> 29:08.009
Bravo Foxtrot.

29:08.176 --> 29:09.719
lt's an explicit term for a sexual--

29:09.886 --> 29:12.389
- lt wasn't supposed to happen like this.
- Like what?

29:15.183 --> 29:17.269
lf a drive-by killing
isn't solved right away,

29:17.435 --> 29:19.437
the cops forget it.

29:19.604 --> 29:21.064
NClS forgot about it.

29:22.816 --> 29:27.362
Private Reggio was my best friend.
He died in my arms.

29:27.529 --> 29:30.198
l couldn't just let that go, sir.

29:30.365 --> 29:33.159
- So you decided to turn a quick buck?
- No.

29:33.326 --> 29:37.247
l called Sosa to meet
but not to sell him any weapons.

29:37.414 --> 29:38.748
l wanted blood.

29:38.915 --> 29:41.459
And your first sergeant
found out about it.

29:41.626 --> 29:44.629
l don't know how, but he did.

29:44.796 --> 29:47.173
He yanked my leave
and restricted me to base.

29:47.340 --> 29:50.010
And he went to the meeting
in your place.

29:51.386 --> 29:53.805
He didn't go down there
to kill anyone, sir.

29:53.972 --> 29:56.057
He went down there to make peace.

29:57.100 --> 29:58.852
To end it.

29:59.436 --> 30:01.771
He didn't want anyone else
to get hurt.

30:02.480 --> 30:06.234
lf l could, l'd switch places with him.

30:06.776 --> 30:08.028
l would.

30:08.194 --> 30:09.905
Yeah.

30:12.198 --> 30:15.535
Yeah, l think you would,
lance corporal.

30:17.037 --> 30:18.121
lt checks out.

30:18.288 --> 30:21.291
Quantico gate log shows
that Downing restricted Silva to base

30:21.458 --> 30:24.252
on November 26th
for the duration of his leave.

30:24.419 --> 30:26.671
Lance Corporal Silva
wasn't at the pond.

30:26.838 --> 30:27.881
He didn't kill anyone.

30:28.048 --> 30:30.050
Thank you. l owe you one, Simon.

30:30.217 --> 30:31.843
That was my contact
in San Salvador.

30:32.010 --> 30:34.387
- He locate Sosa?
- No. He's not there.

30:34.554 --> 30:36.765
He has to be. Bernal's texting there
a dozen times a day.

30:36.932 --> 30:39.684
lf Simon says he's not
in San Salvador, then he's not there.

30:39.851 --> 30:41.061
- He has to be.
- Gibbs, l'm--

30:41.228 --> 30:43.396
lf not, we've wasted three days.

30:43.563 --> 30:46.524
l am not wasting one more
to bring those Marines home.

30:46.691 --> 30:49.152
You find him. Now.

30:56.910 --> 31:00.539
Men, we are here today
for three reasons.

31:01.706 --> 31:05.418
One, we can't find Miguel Sosa.

31:06.044 --> 31:10.924
Two, l'm not even sure
that he exists.

31:11.091 --> 31:12.676
And three--

31:12.842 --> 31:14.094
Who were you talking to?

31:18.098 --> 31:21.226
You will address me as ''sir,'' soldier.

31:21.393 --> 31:24.437
Sorry. Who were you talking to, sir?

31:25.188 --> 31:27.023
My army.

31:27.399 --> 31:29.067
Major Mass Spec.

31:29.234 --> 31:31.861
Captain Comparison Microscope.

31:32.028 --> 31:33.738
- Ensign--
- lsn't an Army rank.

31:33.905 --> 31:35.740
lt's actually Navy.

31:37.450 --> 31:38.994
What do you want, McGee?

31:39.160 --> 31:41.079
To go over the old text messages

31:41.246 --> 31:43.081
between Cesar Bernal
and his boss, Miguel Sosa.

31:43.248 --> 31:45.083
- They're in code.
- l know. But if we break them,

31:45.250 --> 31:47.586
we might find where Sosa's hiding.

31:48.086 --> 31:51.506
- He's in San Salvador.
- Ziva's people say no.

31:51.673 --> 31:55.051
Oh, so if Ziva's people say no,
then we--

31:55.218 --> 31:58.096
- Abby, please, just run them.
- Okay.

32:00.765 --> 32:02.934
My Spanish is a little rusty.

32:03.101 --> 32:04.644
Mine's not.

32:04.811 --> 32:10.150
Okay, in this one
they're asking Sosa if they should--

32:10.775 --> 32:12.944
- Wait a minute.
- What?

32:13.945 --> 32:15.405
lt's too long.

32:15.232 --> 32:19.152
SMS text messages are limited to
1 50 characters. So that means--

32:19.319 --> 32:22.573
lt means that it was e-mailed
from a computer, not a cell phone.

32:22.739 --> 32:24.491
Can you backtrace it
to a physical location?

32:24.658 --> 32:27.995
Just a simple matter of accessing
the e-mail-to-SMS gateway,

32:28.161 --> 32:30.956
pulling an lP, linking to an lSP.

32:31.123 --> 32:32.624
That's a Virginia address.

32:32.791 --> 32:34.835
Ziva's people were right.

32:35.002 --> 32:37.713
Let me see if we can get a name
of the account holder.

32:39.089 --> 32:40.257
Cesar Bernal?

32:40.424 --> 32:42.009
That doesn't make any sense.

32:42.175 --> 32:44.803
Why would he send messages
to himself?

32:44.970 --> 32:47.806
Because he was pretending
he's Miguel Sosa.

32:47.973 --> 32:50.100
Okay, but that's stupid.

32:50.267 --> 32:52.477
Because Sosa would totally find out
and kill Cesar.

32:52.644 --> 32:54.938
Not if Cesar killed him first.

32:59.818 --> 33:02.154
What is this meal gonna cost me
this time?

33:02.321 --> 33:03.864
Didn't cost you any last time.

33:04.072 --> 33:07.993
You mean aside from the thousand
extra calories l didn't need?

33:08.160 --> 33:09.328
l can leave.

33:09.494 --> 33:11.121
l didn't say that.

33:11.997 --> 33:14.291
Salvadorian food?

33:15.083 --> 33:17.169
How fried.

33:18.295 --> 33:20.005
Sit. l'm sorry.

33:24.718 --> 33:28.055
Another Marine was injured
in Captain Arvidas' group.

33:28.222 --> 33:29.556
l know.

33:33.101 --> 33:36.021
l heard you found the man responsible
for First Sergeant Downing's death.

33:36.188 --> 33:38.690
His name is Cesar Bernal.

33:40.484 --> 33:42.152
Can you make a case?

33:43.987 --> 33:46.073
l knew this meal
was gonna cost me.

33:46.240 --> 33:49.701
Okay, what do you have so far?

33:50.244 --> 33:53.372
Cesar is making a power play
for control of his crew.

33:53.539 --> 33:56.375
He's been faking orders
from Miguel Sosa

33:56.542 --> 33:59.211
to the rest of L.V.M.
for the last four months.

33:59.378 --> 34:01.380
And Sosa?

34:01.547 --> 34:02.923
He's dead.

34:03.090 --> 34:05.884
lt's the only way Cesar
could have gotten away with it.

34:07.636 --> 34:10.013
So First Sergeant Downing
wasn't the target.

34:10.179 --> 34:12.014
He was Cesar's lure.

34:12.181 --> 34:15.561
The real targets
were the three L.V.M. lieutenants.

34:16.812 --> 34:18.897
Cesar was taking out the leadership.

34:19.898 --> 34:21.567
Do you have any physical evidence?

34:21.733 --> 34:23.902
Nothing linking Cesar
to the crime scene.

34:24.402 --> 34:26.237
Jethro, you're gonna need
more than motive

34:26.405 --> 34:28.322
to get a jury to convict.

34:30.158 --> 34:32.244
Depends on the jury.

34:38.876 --> 34:40.377
This is harassment.

34:40.793 --> 34:45.132
When l get out of here,
l'm going to get me a fancy lawyer

34:45.299 --> 34:47.426
and shove him all the way up your--

34:47.592 --> 34:48.927
Come on, it was just getting good.

34:49.094 --> 34:51.263
Okay, who wants to take him first?

34:51.429 --> 34:54.683
- l'm gonna take him.
- Oh, no, no, no. l got it, probie.

34:56.810 --> 34:58.770
What, do you think
l can't handle this guy?

34:59.396 --> 35:00.439
Gibbs said keep him on ice.

35:00.606 --> 35:03.275
Not show him the warning signs
of osteoarthritis.

35:03.984 --> 35:05.277
Tony, l can break this guy.

35:05.444 --> 35:06.987
You keep cracking
your knuckles like that,

35:07.154 --> 35:08.906
you're gonna break a finger, probie.

35:09.072 --> 35:11.533
l'm senior. l go first.

35:11.700 --> 35:15.913
- You're always gonna be senior.
- Nice thing about being senior is that--

35:20.459 --> 35:23.921
So l cooperate with you
and this is the thanks l get?

35:24.087 --> 35:26.298
<i>Hauled in like a pescado muerto?</i>

35:26.465 --> 35:28.091
lf by cooperate you mean lie, yes.

35:28.258 --> 35:30.135
What did l lie about?

35:30.302 --> 35:33.472
We know you were at the Rock Creek
Pond the night of the murders,

35:33.639 --> 35:36.808
and we know you've been killing off
the L.V.M. leadership to assert control.

35:36.975 --> 35:39.686
You must think very highly of me,

35:39.853 --> 35:42.522
because the man who can pull off
something like that,

35:42.689 --> 35:45.442
must be a very smart man.

35:46.652 --> 35:50.322
<i>You like smart men, bonita?</i>

35:54.117 --> 35:56.787
Sorry. You're not my type.

35:56.954 --> 35:59.122
<i>You're playing with fire, bonita.</i>

36:00.707 --> 36:03.001
- ls that a threat?
- No.

36:05.337 --> 36:10.008
<i>l'm just saying, my éses get
very lonely when l'm not around.</i>

36:10.175 --> 36:12.469
And they're not going to be too happy
with the one

36:12.636 --> 36:14.304
that's keeping me from them.

36:14.471 --> 36:16.515
l wouldn't worry about it.

36:16.682 --> 36:20.310
<i>l'm sure your éses will find something
to do while you're gone.</i>

36:28.527 --> 36:32.197
The autopsy of First Sergeant
Downing revealed four entry wounds.

36:32.364 --> 36:36.994
However, of interest is the fact
that the three frontal wounds

36:37.160 --> 36:39.830
showed no sign
of internal haemorrhaging.

36:39.997 --> 36:43.834
The shots were fired after
First Sergeant Downing was dead.

36:45.210 --> 36:46.837
Each of your buddies...

36:48.755 --> 36:50.549
...put a bullet in his corpse.

36:54.177 --> 36:55.220
Your point?

36:55.971 --> 37:00.058
The point is if your buddies each fired
a round into the first sergeant

37:00.225 --> 37:04.271
after he was dead, who shot them?

37:13.906 --> 37:16.450
l want to talk to my lawyer.

37:18.243 --> 37:20.621
<i>No can do, punk.</i>

37:25.125 --> 37:28.503
You've been watching
too many cop shows, know that?

37:29.087 --> 37:34.259
Yeah, well you've been watching
too many gang-person shows.

37:36.094 --> 37:38.430
l don't think probie's
been watching enough cop shows.

37:38.597 --> 37:41.016
McGee is a capable interrogator.

37:41.183 --> 37:44.061
He can be quite intimidating
when he wants to be.

37:46.563 --> 37:48.649
You can't keep me here like this.

37:48.815 --> 37:50.609
No, actually, l can.

37:50.776 --> 37:54.404
You see, La Vida Mala
has suspected ties to Al Qaeda.

37:56.365 --> 37:59.159
So all l have to do
is say the word ''terrorist,''

37:59.326 --> 38:03.330
and l can keep you in this room
till you grow old and die.

38:04.748 --> 38:08.043
That actually was intimidating.

38:09.962 --> 38:11.672
We can tell from the rifling patterns

38:11.838 --> 38:14.800
that the slugs pulled
from your three dead L.V.M.'s

38:14.967 --> 38:17.761
were from the Browning
found at the scene. Nice tat.

38:17.928 --> 38:20.514
Your Draconkreuz?

38:20.681 --> 38:22.683
- The symbol of the ancient order of--
- Abby.

38:23.308 --> 38:27.229
Sorry, Gibbs. The point is that
whoever shot your guys

38:27.396 --> 38:29.523
used First Sergeant Downing's gun.

38:29.690 --> 38:31.775
He wanted to make it look like
our first sergeant

38:31.942 --> 38:33.694
<i>smoked your muchachos.</i>

38:33.861 --> 38:37.072
Of course, your crew probably
would have only turned their backs

38:37.239 --> 38:40.409
to the shooter if it was someone
they really trusted.

38:51.253 --> 38:54.882
So, like,
you don't got no questions for me?

38:55.841 --> 38:57.050
That's a double negative.

38:58.051 --> 39:00.721
''Don't got no'' is a double negative.

39:00.888 --> 39:05.100
lt's a non-standard use of two
negative words in the same sentence.

39:05.267 --> 39:07.352
They cancel each other out
and create a positive.

39:07.519 --> 39:10.689
ln Shakespeare's day, the double
negative was used as an emphatic.

39:10.856 --> 39:13.025
But now it's just considered
a mistake.

39:14.192 --> 39:16.528
Don't know if that's what
you intended. Pretty sure it's not.

39:16.695 --> 39:19.364
We'll go with the colloquial
idiomatic thing. This is hard.

39:19.531 --> 39:21.658
l'm pretty sure you meant:
''Do l have any questions?''

39:21.825 --> 39:24.494
And the answer to that question is:
''l have no questions.''

39:24.661 --> 39:26.371
l do have some
observations, though.

39:26.538 --> 39:28.290
Cesar. That's an interesting name.

39:28.457 --> 39:31.543
Obviously derived from Caesar.
That was a powerful dude.

39:31.710 --> 39:33.503
My name's Anthony.
Friends call me Tony.

39:33.670 --> 39:35.756
Which backwards is ''why not.''

39:35.923 --> 39:39.051
Anyway, in the pecking order,

39:39.218 --> 39:41.678
l'm guessing that you're somewhere
between the guy that goes out

39:41.845 --> 39:45.224
and buys the spray paint
that you use for tagging

39:45.390 --> 39:47.726
and the guy who digs it out
from under your boss' nails.

39:50.479 --> 39:52.231
You don't know who
you're messing with.

39:52.898 --> 39:57.402
One word from me
and my crew will have you splattered--

39:57.569 --> 39:59.071
- Your crew?
- Yes.

39:59.238 --> 40:02.407
Well, that's funny. l thought L.V.M.
was Miguel Sosa's crew.

40:06.203 --> 40:07.913
lnteresting.

40:08.413 --> 40:10.040
Miguel Sosa.

40:10.207 --> 40:13.252
Word on the street is he is hiding out
in El Salvador.

40:13.418 --> 40:16.547
Except the FBl has no record
of him leaving the country.

40:16.713 --> 40:19.800
Salvadorian authorities
have no record of him coming in.

40:19.967 --> 40:23.345
So the only trail we have is the SMS
text messages he's been sending you.

40:23.512 --> 40:26.056
The problem is,
he hasn't been sending them.

40:26.223 --> 40:28.976
El Salvador country code
has been falsified.

40:29.142 --> 40:31.770
Someone faked them to make them
look like they came from Miguel Sosa.

40:32.437 --> 40:37.234
Messages originated from an e-mail
account registered to Cesar Bernal.

40:38.277 --> 40:39.611
He killed your boss.

40:39.778 --> 40:41.780
Played you for a fool.

40:41.947 --> 40:43.115
Us too.

40:43.282 --> 40:46.410
He'll never get a conviction in court
with what l have on him.

40:56.044 --> 40:57.629
Hey, boss.

40:59.631 --> 41:02.259
Right. l see.

41:02.426 --> 41:05.304
You were all trying
to throw me off balance.

41:05.470 --> 41:08.640
Soften me up for the big guns, eh?

41:11.143 --> 41:13.145
Actually,
l didn't know you were still here.

41:13.312 --> 41:15.647
Come on, l'll drive you home.

41:17.566 --> 41:19.735
Wear your safety belt.

41:25.824 --> 41:27.367
Door-to-door service.

41:27.534 --> 41:29.995
l could get used to this.

41:31.496 --> 41:33.290
What's the matter?

41:33.832 --> 41:37.711
You're pissed because whatever game
you tried to play didn't work?

41:39.087 --> 41:42.174
<i>You got a lot to learn
about the streets, cabron.</i>

41:42.341 --> 41:48.889
<i>Loyalty means everything in our world.
Without it, estas muerto.</i>

41:55.938 --> 41:58.023
Thanks for the lift.

42:07.699 --> 42:09.284
<i>Semper fi.</i>

42:10.869 --> 42:12.746
Goodbye, Cesar.

42:25.217 --> 42:28.387
<i>These NClS pendejos just won't quit.</i>

42:28.554 --> 42:31.515
l got a message from Sosa.

42:31.682 --> 42:35.602
He thinks we ought to teach them
some manners.

42:40.857 --> 42:42.234
What?

42:42.401 --> 42:44.236
<i>The victim, a male in his early 20s,</i>

42:44.403 --> 42:48.156
<i>was found in this dumpster,
shot repeatedly at close range.</i>

42:48.323 --> 42:50.659
<i>Police have identified him
as Cesar Bernal,</i>

42:50.826 --> 42:52.411
<i>a native of El Salvador,</i>

42:52.578 --> 42:56.582
<i>and say they believe he has close ties
to gang activity in the Manassas area.</i>

42:56.748 --> 42:58.917
<i>ln fact, police say he--</i>

42:59.084 --> 43:01.378
You don't have work to do,
l'm sure l can find some.

43:01.545 --> 43:05.007
- No. l got a lot of work to do, boss.
- There's lots of work.

43:05.465 --> 43:06.967
Good.

43:07.134 --> 43:09.386
l'll be in MTAC.

43:17.686 --> 43:20.314
<i>- Captain.
- Agent Gibbs.</i>

43:20.480 --> 43:22.983
<i>l hope you have
some good news for me.</i>

43:23.150 --> 43:25.527
Bring our boys home.
