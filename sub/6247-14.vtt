WEBVTT

00:01.080 --> 00:05.551
<i>We'll be meeting with agents from
the FAA, the NTSB and locaI police.</i>

00:05.640 --> 00:08.996
- Booth handles them.
- Plane crashes don't belong to the FBI.

00:09.080 --> 00:11.640
Why not? FAA is FederaI
Aviation Administration.

00:11.720 --> 00:16.714
The NTSB stands for NationaI Transportation
Safety Board. That sounds federaI. And FBI...

00:16.800 --> 00:18.153
Zack.

00:18.240 --> 00:22.836
- Investigating without Booth, I don't like it.
- Why? He mostly ignores you.

00:22.920 --> 00:27.038
Ignoring me is Booth's way of
acknowledging my presence. It's a guy thing.

00:28.360 --> 00:30.351
Here we are.

00:32.000 --> 00:38.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:43.800 --> 00:45.074
- Dr Brennan?
- Yes.

00:45.160 --> 00:49.438
- I'm Ian Dyson with the NTSB.
- This is my assistant, Zack Addy.

00:49.520 --> 00:54.640
At approximately 0400 last night a
private jet with five passengers on board

00:54.720 --> 00:58.918
reported horizontaI stabiliser
trouble 200 miles southeast of Norfolk.

00:59.000 --> 01:01.309
Yeager Airport tracked
them for 30 minutes

01:01.400 --> 01:04.949
untiI they dropped off
the radar screen at 0430.

01:05.040 --> 01:09.670
The plane tried to land here when it
clipped some trees and slammed to the ground.

01:09.760 --> 01:14.231
We found another mostly intact body over
near the trees. The rest is bits and pieces.

01:14.320 --> 01:17.312
- What makes this one of our cases?
- I beg your pardon?

01:17.400 --> 01:21.757
We're kind of speciaI. We're elite. We
don't sort through just any set of bodies.

01:21.840 --> 01:25.913
It was a State Department flight with a
bunch of VIPs on board. SpeciaI enough?

01:26.000 --> 01:27.877
I apologise if I've offended you.

01:27.960 --> 01:31.635
Usually we have an FBI agent who
mediates our interpersonaI encounters.

01:31.720 --> 01:34.029
- We found another skull.
- Two skulls.

01:34.120 --> 01:36.475
Those pieces are from
two different skulls.

01:36.560 --> 01:39.836
I'll leave you super-elite types to it.

01:41.360 --> 01:46.229
Zack, we don't need Booth to "mediate
our interpersonaI encounters".

01:46.320 --> 01:48.356
OK. Pilot, copilot.

01:48.440 --> 01:51.034
Brings our count to six.

01:51.120 --> 01:56.035
Three mostly intact sets of remains,
one partiaI and two fragmented.

01:56.120 --> 01:59.192
Obviously bodies are burned to a crisp.

01:59.280 --> 02:02.158
No dermis, very little soft tissue.

02:02.240 --> 02:04.754
Indications of high impact trauma.

02:04.840 --> 02:07.308
Fractures of the thoracic
and lumbar vertebrae

02:07.400 --> 02:11.154
consistent with injuries caused by
the impact of the falling aircraft.

02:11.240 --> 02:14.471
Should I keep talking as
though you're paying attention?

02:14.560 --> 02:16.755
What do you make of this?

02:21.240 --> 02:23.674
- Femur fragment.
- No charring.

02:23.760 --> 02:28.072
- You think this doesn't belong to the crash.
- What are the odds?

02:28.160 --> 02:31.470
Of a crashing plane falling
directly on a human being?

02:31.560 --> 02:34.757
One in ten million.

02:37.480 --> 02:40.153
What I am about to tell you
must not leave this room.

02:40.240 --> 02:43.835
I am philosophically opposed to
institutionaI secrecy in all forms.

02:43.920 --> 02:46.275
<i>Fine. Get out.</i>

02:46.840 --> 02:50.196
Two Communist Chinese trade
attachÃ©s were on that plane.

02:50.280 --> 02:53.590
- Both high-ranking party members.
- Obviously we shot it down.

02:53.680 --> 02:56.956
The FAA and the NTSB can
prove that it was an accident.

02:57.040 --> 03:01.989
Also on the manifest was an American
businessman, a pilot and a copilot.

03:02.080 --> 03:04.071
<i>- Five people.
- Dr Goodman.</i>

03:04.160 --> 03:07.436
We found six sets of human
remains on that airplane.

03:07.520 --> 03:10.353
And three bone fragments
which were not on the plane.

03:10.440 --> 03:14.274
- Is there any chance they were on
the plane? - As carry-on luggage?

03:14.360 --> 03:17.796
No. Everything on the plane
burned. They were untouched by fire.

03:17.880 --> 03:20.633
Forget about the bone
fragments for the time being.

03:20.720 --> 03:24.474
The State Department is anxious to
find the identity of that sixth person.

03:24.560 --> 03:29.953
No one wishes this to be an internationaI
incident, therefore this is our only priority.

03:30.040 --> 03:32.998
- I disagree.
- For the love of God, why?

03:33.080 --> 03:36.914
Because the plane crash was an
accident. The bone fragments were not.

03:37.000 --> 03:39.514
- How do you know?
- Zack found unusuaI cut marks.

03:39.600 --> 03:42.831
Cut marks congruent with dismemberment.

03:42.920 --> 03:46.674
People, one hour ago I received
a call from the secretary of state

03:46.760 --> 03:51.595
requesting that the unidentified
extra passenger be our first priority.

03:51.680 --> 03:54.399
So now politics are more
important than murder?

03:54.480 --> 03:58.234
I'm not saying please or being
reasonable. I'm making the decision.

03:58.320 --> 04:02.950
First and foremost,
identify that sixth body.

04:11.200 --> 04:15.830
- You got it, or you want me to explain again?
- No, I got it, OK? The plane goes down.

04:15.920 --> 04:18.115
There's an extra body
you don't care about

04:18.200 --> 04:21.829
cos you're more interested in
these bone fragments that you found.

04:21.920 --> 04:25.196
- Exactly.
- Oh. This all you got?

04:25.680 --> 04:29.514
So far. A piece of skull, a chunk
of vertebra, part of a femur.

04:29.600 --> 04:33.036
- Not much to go on.
- These come from a person who was hacked.

04:33.120 --> 04:35.714
- Hacked to little bits?
- No, medium-size bits.

04:35.800 --> 04:39.873
- I'm not sure how it turned into little bits yet.
- OK, and I'm here why?

04:39.960 --> 04:45.398
- Dismemberment, little bits... It's a murder.
- FBI has no jurisdiction at a golf course.

04:45.480 --> 04:48.472
- Who does?
- I don't know. Try the PGA.

04:48.560 --> 04:52.473
Uh-huh. You know, you've done a couple
of cases without me and you miss me.

04:52.560 --> 04:54.994
- Zack misses you.
- Zack and I don't even talk.

04:55.080 --> 04:57.833
- He thinks it's a male bonding rituaI.
- Maybe.

04:57.920 --> 04:58.955
- No.
- Could be.

04:59.040 --> 05:01.838
- You just told him that.
- It was nicer than shooting him.

05:01.920 --> 05:06.232
Hm! Goodman has ordered me to
investigate the other extra body.

05:06.320 --> 05:10.677
You better get on that. Next time you miss
me, call me. We'll do lunch or something.

05:10.760 --> 05:13.115
- I do not miss you.
- You miss me. Say it.

05:13.200 --> 05:16.590
- I do not miss you.
- Dr Brennan, Agent Booth, you have a visitor.

05:16.680 --> 05:19.558
- No, I don't.
- You miss me. You miss me.

05:25.400 --> 05:27.197
- Dr Temperance Brennan?
- Yes.

05:27.280 --> 05:30.431
- Agent Seeley Booth, I'm Jesse Kane.
- You're Jesse Kane?

05:30.520 --> 05:32.476
- You've heard of me?
- I haven't.

05:32.560 --> 05:35.313
Jesse here's an expert
on missing persons cases.

05:35.400 --> 05:39.234
I've written on missing person
laws and investigative techniques,

05:39.320 --> 05:42.835
interagency cooperation,
jurisdictionaI dispute.

05:42.920 --> 05:46.993
- I heard about the bones you found.
- I can't really talk about that.

05:47.080 --> 05:51.392
- I don't mean the Communist Chinese.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. Communist Chinese?

05:51.480 --> 05:55.792
- The other bones. The fragments.
- How did you hear about the Chinese?

05:55.880 --> 05:58.997
Those pieces of bone you
found at the golf course,

05:59.080 --> 06:02.436
I'm pretty sure that's my dad.

06:35.960 --> 06:41.034
My expertise in missing persons derives from one thing
- my search for my father.

06:41.120 --> 06:44.556
He went missing five years ago
during a trip to Virginia Beach.

06:44.640 --> 06:47.200
What makes you think the
fragments are your father?

06:47.280 --> 06:52.195
There is a question of nationaI security.
He's not supposed to know about the Chinese.

06:52.280 --> 06:57.035
My investigations lead me to conclude my
father was murdered and his body disposed.

06:57.120 --> 06:59.395
- And the police?
- They gave up four years ago.

06:59.480 --> 07:02.711
- No evidence of fouI play.
- The investigation was bungled.

07:02.800 --> 07:06.395
The city police didn't have the manpower,
state troopers said it was federaI,

07:06.480 --> 07:08.675
and you suggested a
private investigator.

07:08.760 --> 07:13.675
It was not bungled, OK? Because there was no
evidence of fouI play. It's a common story.

07:13.760 --> 07:18.470
A guy goes in for a pack of cigarettes, he
ends up renting out snorkelling gear in Guam.

07:19.120 --> 07:22.590
He doesn't know what it's
like to lose a parent. You do.

07:22.680 --> 07:25.717
- You wanna back down there?
- How do you know about that?

07:25.800 --> 07:29.554
No offence, but you're a writer, a
well-known scientist. It's out there.

07:29.640 --> 07:31.437
- Plus, you're one of us.
- One of us?

07:31.520 --> 07:34.478
People whose loved ones have
vanished. Both your parents.

07:34.560 --> 07:38.394
OK. How do you know about the
Chinese? Do not look at Dr Brennan, OK?

07:38.480 --> 07:42.268
Whether you like it or not, this
is an issue between you and the FBI.

07:42.360 --> 07:45.716
If body parts are found where
my father disappeared, I know.

07:45.800 --> 07:48.519
Radio chatter, the
internet, law enforcement...

07:48.600 --> 07:53.799
That's all I'm prepared to tell you. You mind
if I ask how many bone fragments you found?

07:53.880 --> 07:57.555
Yes, I do. I don't discuss
ongoing investigations.

07:57.640 --> 08:00.837
She doesn't discuss
ongoing investigations.

08:00.920 --> 08:04.230
Fair enough. These are my
notes from the last five years.

08:04.320 --> 08:07.232
Every lead, clue, every person
I've talked with is here.

08:07.320 --> 08:13.236
- And why would Dr Brennan care about that?
- Cos it will give her a candidate to eliminate.

08:13.320 --> 08:15.231
He's got a point.

08:15.320 --> 08:18.949
My father's medicaI records,
pictures, last known whereabouts,

08:19.040 --> 08:22.350
even a connection to the golf course.

08:22.800 --> 08:24.791
Also my phone number.

08:24.880 --> 08:29.908
But don't worry. If I don't hear
from you, you'll hear from me.

08:33.520 --> 08:36.239
<i>Wow. Pushy.</i>

08:37.000 --> 08:40.309
Maybe he discovered being pushy
gets cops to pay attention.

08:40.400 --> 08:44.916
- What are you hawking at me for?
- The Chinese, plane crash, that's geopolitics.

08:45.000 --> 08:47.434
This is murder.

08:48.280 --> 08:49.429
Will you help?

08:51.040 --> 08:53.952
Well, you know, I guess
if you're really asking me,

08:54.040 --> 08:56.634
I guess I could, you
know, fudge it with my boss

08:56.720 --> 09:01.953
to make it look like it was attached
to the Chinese plane crash thing.

09:03.240 --> 09:07.392
- We've made progress on the passenger.
- Fill me in.

09:07.480 --> 09:11.473
NasaI ridges indicate she was a
Caucasoid female approximately 5' 10".

09:11.560 --> 09:15.269
EpiphyseaI fusion puts her
age somewhere between 20 to 25.

09:15.360 --> 09:17.555
- I have a theory.
- Femme fatale assassin.

09:17.640 --> 09:20.916
- Unregistered flight attendant.
- Young, beautifuI girI,

09:21.000 --> 09:25.357
doesn't appear on the in-flight
manifest, group of high-powered politicos?

09:25.440 --> 09:27.431
- Oh.
- Wait, what? What?

09:27.520 --> 09:31.229
Someone might've been doing his
daughter's girlfriend a favour.

09:31.320 --> 09:34.790
<i>- You're so sweet, honey. You really are.
- Oh!</i>

09:34.880 --> 09:39.476
You think she was the
in-flight entertainment.

09:40.240 --> 09:43.630
Anything you want to tell us
about the bone bits you care about?

09:43.720 --> 09:47.952
SupraorbitaI margin is
rounded, suggesting a male.

09:48.040 --> 09:52.033
There are signs of osteophytic lipping
or polish on this piece of vertebra.

09:52.120 --> 09:54.190
- Arthritis. - So
middle-aged guy.

09:54.280 --> 09:57.989
Weathering and discoloration suggest
these bones have been out there

09:58.080 --> 10:00.435
for approximately five years.

10:01.280 --> 10:05.717
- I'm going to ask you to help me on this.
- You mean after the Communist thing?

10:05.800 --> 10:07.916
- No, immediately.
- I'm in.

10:08.000 --> 10:10.116
- You want us to defy Dr Goodman?
- I'm in.

10:10.200 --> 10:14.876
Not defy per se. Do both jobs
but... but keep one a secret.

10:14.960 --> 10:17.315
- I'm in.
- We get it. You're a rebeI.

10:17.400 --> 10:19.914
Zack, I need you to analyse
the cuts on the bone.

10:20.000 --> 10:21.911
I was kinda hoping to keep my job.

10:22.000 --> 10:25.151
There's not enough skull here
for me to do a reconstruction.

10:25.240 --> 10:28.357
If I gave you a picture you
could tell me if it doesn't match?

10:28.440 --> 10:33.833
I could construct a schematic and see if the
shard fit the skull's shape, if I had a picture.

10:33.920 --> 10:38.118
Has anyone noticed that I was the first
to offer help and apparently I'm useless?

10:38.200 --> 10:42.034
Not true. You're the one that's going
to keep Goodman from finding out.

10:42.120 --> 10:44.111
I'm in.

10:44.440 --> 10:47.079
The fragments are the same
sex and age as my father.

10:47.160 --> 10:49.435
- Yes.
- Thank you.

10:49.520 --> 10:51.670
- It's a long way from conclusive.
- Yeah.

10:51.760 --> 10:56.788
I know at times like these not to get hopefuI,
but on the other hand you gotta have hope.

10:56.880 --> 11:00.236
- Even after five years?
- People are found after decades.

11:00.320 --> 11:03.278
After centuries. You've
done some of the finding.

11:03.360 --> 11:07.717
Booth says you've made a living off
of the disappearance of your father.

11:07.800 --> 11:12.237
Six months after my father disappeared,
I found out nobody was looking for him.

11:12.320 --> 11:15.756
Next thing, I was an expert in
motivating the police, victims' rights.

11:15.840 --> 11:20.152
Becoming well known is a by-product of
my search for my father, not the goaI.

11:20.240 --> 11:23.118
You should understand my
motivation better than most.

11:23.200 --> 11:28.797
I'm not really interested in
bonding over the loss of my parents.

11:28.880 --> 11:33.237
- Booth is looking over your file now.
- I wasn't looking for his help.

11:33.320 --> 11:37.518
We work together. Booth knows the bone
fragments are evidence of fouI play.

11:37.600 --> 11:40.114
That's all the motivation he needed.

11:40.200 --> 11:42.668
You didn't have to lean on him?

11:44.160 --> 11:46.833
Not at all.

11:46.920 --> 11:49.275
If you say so.

12:00.920 --> 12:04.196
One fragment has distinctive
ridge-mark indentations.

12:04.280 --> 12:06.714
- Knife mark.
- Specifically a carving knife.

12:06.800 --> 12:09.598
What about the other
ones, the jagged marks?

12:09.680 --> 12:12.240
Some kind of machine blade.

12:12.320 --> 12:15.630
What? Like a... ajigsaw or a chainsaw?

12:15.720 --> 12:20.840
<i>Are you suggesting a Chinese
diplomat was wielding a chainsaw?</i>

12:22.280 --> 12:28.276
Good one, sir. Very droll. Zack
knows much more about this than I do.

12:28.360 --> 12:33.309
We weren't discussing a literaI chainsaw cut
but rather the pattern it leaves on the bone.

12:33.400 --> 12:35.595
Right? Zack?

12:35.680 --> 12:40.037
- Blades move in severaI distinctive ways.
- SeveraI distinctive ways.

12:40.120 --> 12:43.351
Circular, ellipticaI, segmented.
Chainsaws cut soft materials at high sped.

12:43.440 --> 12:48.036
When cutting hard materials they create
wave-edged walls. This pattern's too linear.

12:48.120 --> 12:51.510
Therefore, no Chinese
chainsaw massacre scenario.

12:51.600 --> 12:53.033
Hm.

12:53.120 --> 12:56.510
Fascinating. What has it to do
with the victims of the plane crash?

12:56.600 --> 13:01.549
We have to reassemble the crash victims and
figure out how their remains were scattered.

13:01.640 --> 13:04.598
Not by being cut up, that's for sure.

13:04.680 --> 13:07.274
Now we've eliminated blades.

13:10.440 --> 13:14.718
- Never freeze on me again.
- I find Dr Goodman scary.

13:14.800 --> 13:19.749
Well, I'm never trusting any of us
again. We're that good at Iying, huh?

13:19.840 --> 13:22.718
We're gonna do much better.

13:26.640 --> 13:29.916
Well, you know, I have to admit
Jesse Kane's file on his father

13:30.000 --> 13:33.151
is both well organised
and complete. Yep.

13:33.240 --> 13:37.518
- His main suspect is his father's girlfriend.
- Karen Anderson.

13:37.600 --> 13:41.479
No alibi. Since they were living
together at the time of the disappearance,

13:41.560 --> 13:44.791
she remains in the house and has
access to theirjoint accounts.

13:44.880 --> 13:48.270
- How much money are we talking about?
- Max Kane was a stock broker.

13:48.360 --> 13:53.229
He was worth millions. But after seven years
missing, the courts will declare him dead,

13:53.320 --> 13:56.517
but by that time she could've
siphoned out most of the money.

13:56.600 --> 14:01.993
So I say we go visit Ms Anderson and
we'll know pretty fast if she's a suspect.

14:02.080 --> 14:05.789
- How?
- How? Subtle psychologicaI indicators.

14:05.880 --> 14:11.637
I looked those up on the internet. Body
language, sweat, tonaI quality, shifty eyes...

14:11.720 --> 14:17.078
Hey, I don't go poking around your bone
stuff, OK? Just leave the human stuff to me.

14:17.160 --> 14:19.515
Why is Max's disappearance
an FBI matter?

14:19.600 --> 14:23.798
- Max's disappearance is not an FBI matter.
- You're an FBI agent.

14:23.880 --> 14:27.077
Human remains were found
during a federaI investigation.

14:27.160 --> 14:29.993
Agent Booth is tasked with
the job of identifying them.

14:30.080 --> 14:33.868
I'd like to eliminate Max Kane as a
possibility and move on altogether.

14:33.960 --> 14:38.078
- So this is a pro forma interview?
- Yes. Yes, absolutely.

14:38.160 --> 14:42.312
Because I know Max's son Jesse
accuses me of Max's murder.

14:42.400 --> 14:45.995
- Why do you think he suspects you?
- Because of the age difference,

14:46.080 --> 14:48.150
because I'm still living in the house.

14:48.240 --> 14:51.630
Because after five years I fell in
love with someone new. Who knows?

14:51.720 --> 14:55.554
Some people find it harder than others
to get over the loss of a loved one.

14:55.640 --> 14:57.278
- Bones.
- What?

14:57.360 --> 15:00.318
Jesse got to you, didn't he?

15:00.400 --> 15:03.551
Yeah. The dimples and the
sad smile and melancholy,

15:03.640 --> 15:07.155
on a mission to find his
beloved father and all that.

15:07.240 --> 15:08.832
Jesse didn't love his father?

15:08.920 --> 15:12.879
Max and Jesse didn't speak for the
two years before Max disappeared,

15:12.960 --> 15:15.520
and that was before
I came into his life.

15:15.600 --> 15:19.275
- What do you think caused the rift?
- Max cut Jesse off financially.

15:19.360 --> 15:23.831
Max thought Jesse was lazy, running around
New York doing nothing with his life.

15:23.920 --> 15:25.797
Well, Jesse was furious.

15:35.600 --> 15:38.398
Hack marks were caused
by a heideI carving knife.

15:38.480 --> 15:41.836
The osteologicaI profile
suggests postmortem freezing.

15:41.920 --> 15:45.435
Max Kane disappeared midwinter.
What about the jagged cut marks?

15:45.520 --> 15:47.556
This is the part that makes me queasy.

15:47.640 --> 15:50.791
The victim was frozen, dismembered,

15:50.880 --> 15:54.555
- and fed into a wood chipper.
- And spread over a golf course.

15:54.640 --> 15:58.349
Either talk loudly enough so I can
hear all the way or whisper so I can't.

15:58.440 --> 16:02.149
Maybe if we told Goodman this he'd
authorise a change in priorities.

16:02.240 --> 16:06.279
- Or he'd suspend us all for defying him.
- Angela's right.

16:06.360 --> 16:11.753
We're gonna drop this and get back to what
Dr Goodman told us to do in the first place?

16:11.840 --> 16:16.516
No. We are going to keep doing what
we're doing behind Goodman's back.

16:16.600 --> 16:19.398
That's the spirit!

16:22.440 --> 16:24.795
Yeah, it's true.

16:24.880 --> 16:28.156
My father cut me off financially.
I take it you talked to Karen.

16:28.240 --> 16:32.279
- Is there anything else you failed to mention?
- I know I didn't kill my father,

16:32.360 --> 16:35.909
so I'd rather you didn't waste your
time on that line of investigation.

16:36.000 --> 16:38.833
Too late. What happened
between you and your father?

16:38.920 --> 16:42.993
I was enrolled at NYU, but all I really
did was go clubbing and have a good time.

16:43.080 --> 16:46.595
My father was right to cut me
off. I was a disappointment to him.

16:46.680 --> 16:50.434
- But if he could see you now...
- I like to think he can see me now.

16:50.520 --> 16:53.751
Your father is dead. A dead
person can't see anything.

16:53.840 --> 16:56.718
Maybe that's true. Maybe it isn't.

16:56.800 --> 17:01.510
But either way, at least I
know my dad would be proud.

17:01.600 --> 17:04.990
Bones, tell Jesse what
happened to the victim.

17:05.079 --> 17:06.991
- Really?
- What?

17:07.079 --> 17:09.469
Usually you tell me not to tell people.

17:09.560 --> 17:13.394
Well, it can't be worse than some
of the things that I've imagined.

17:13.480 --> 17:19.077
The victim was frozen, dismembered
and fed through a wood chipper.

17:20.520 --> 17:23.796
Bones has figured out what
type of wood chipper was used.

17:23.880 --> 17:27.555
We'll see if one was
sold in Virginia Beach.

17:27.640 --> 17:31.679
I can't believe someone
would do that to my dad.

17:32.320 --> 17:35.392
We haven't identified
the victim as your father.

17:35.480 --> 17:40.270
I have our artist comparing the skull
fragment to pictures of your dad.

17:40.360 --> 17:43.477
Could I see the bone fragments?

17:53.920 --> 17:56.480
- This is all of him?
- Yes.

17:57.080 --> 17:59.753
I mean...

17:59.840 --> 18:01.990
It's all of somebody.

18:02.080 --> 18:04.674
He was a big man, my dad.

18:04.760 --> 18:08.469
It's hard to believe that
this is all that's left of him.

18:08.560 --> 18:12.155
How can you get anything
from three small bits of bone?

18:12.240 --> 18:15.038
It's more than a lot of people get.

18:17.720 --> 18:20.837
I know where my dad was
right before he disappeared.

18:20.920 --> 18:26.916
I know my dad met with a client at
the North Star Grill in Virginia Beach.

18:30.080 --> 18:32.833
I know he had meat loaf.

18:36.520 --> 18:41.992
I know he was supposed to meet Karen
at the pier but he didn't show up.

18:42.880 --> 18:49.592
I know she waited two days...
before reporting him gone.

18:57.800 --> 18:59.836
I have a good timeline.

18:59.920 --> 19:02.593
And I have three small bits of bone.

19:05.080 --> 19:11.076
You don't have any of those things and
I realise how hopeless you must feeI.

19:15.680 --> 19:18.148
Come with me.

19:23.600 --> 19:25.670
This is all you have?

19:25.760 --> 19:28.274
Yes. You were right
about how little it is.

19:28.360 --> 19:32.239
No, I mean this is simply
your copy of the officiaI file.

19:32.320 --> 19:34.117
Yes. What else would there be?

19:34.200 --> 19:38.318
You never tried to hire any private
investigators? Did any poking around?

19:38.400 --> 19:43.110
Well, I'm pretty new at field work. I've
mostly been a lab rat my whole career.

19:43.200 --> 19:46.590
Plus, I trusted the authorities
would do what they could.

19:46.680 --> 19:52.073
The authorities have rooms filled
with files like these, warehouses.

19:52.160 --> 19:57.632
- I'm the authorities. Booth is the authorities.
- Did you ever show this file to Booth?

19:57.720 --> 19:59.995
No. No.

20:07.120 --> 20:09.031
This is where I work.

20:09.120 --> 20:11.998
Uh, which is my cue.

20:12.080 --> 20:13.718
<i>Uh...</i>

20:13.800 --> 20:16.758
Um, Angela, come in. This is Jesse Kane.

20:16.840 --> 20:18.558
- Hello.
- Hi.

20:18.640 --> 20:21.518
Hi. Angela Montenegro.

20:22.280 --> 20:25.590
- What's that?
- Oh, uh, nothing that can't wait.

20:25.680 --> 20:27.796
Is it about my father?

20:27.880 --> 20:31.953
As far as I know, which
is quite far, believe me,

20:32.040 --> 20:35.510
no one has tried to kiss Brennan
in this office and lived to tell.

20:35.600 --> 20:36.715
Angela...

20:36.800 --> 20:41.271
Would one of you please tell
me what that piece of paper is?

20:41.360 --> 20:45.911
It's a, uh... it's a schematic comparing the
skull fragment we found on the golf course

20:46.000 --> 20:47.991
- to pictures of your father.
- And?

20:48.080 --> 20:50.196
It doesn't not match your father.

20:50.280 --> 20:52.510
So it could be him?

20:52.600 --> 20:55.876
Yeah. There's a pretty good chance.

21:00.200 --> 21:03.078
I knew it.

21:03.160 --> 21:05.833
- Are you hooking up?
- We didn't arrange anything.

21:05.920 --> 21:08.275
- Why not?
- Cos you were there, hovering.

21:08.360 --> 21:11.830
- I was not. I was being your wingman.
- What's that?

21:11.920 --> 21:15.196
I was rendering assistance
and enabling where needed.

21:15.280 --> 21:17.271
Booth thinks he might be a suspect.

21:17.360 --> 21:20.477
Now you're just looking for
excuses not to get involved.

21:20.560 --> 21:25.395
Plane crash victim number four,
Captain Jacob Howard, pilot, age 47.

21:25.480 --> 21:29.439
Height five foot six,
weight approximately 167Ib.

21:29.520 --> 21:31.715
Overlay the photograph.

21:36.080 --> 21:38.389
Frontozygomatic sutures line up.

21:38.480 --> 21:42.553
- CraniaI meninges are in sync.
- Excellent. That's one more off the list.

21:42.640 --> 21:47.236
Victim number five,
Shan Woo Fong, age 56.

21:47.320 --> 21:50.710
Height five foot six,
weight approximately 140Ib.

21:50.800 --> 21:54.509
That's terrific, except we knew all
of these people were on the plane.

21:54.600 --> 21:58.878
What the State Department wants to know
is the identity of our mystery woman.

21:58.960 --> 22:01.952
I hope I can count on
your full energies on this.

22:02.040 --> 22:04.634
If I can be completely honest, sir...

22:04.720 --> 22:09.555
Toxicology reports came back from all
six victims. Pilot and copilot were clean.

22:09.640 --> 22:14.953
Our two Chinese nationals had elevated
levels of alcohoI and sildenafiI, or Viagra.

22:15.040 --> 22:18.589
And our mystery girI showed
traces of alcohoI and cocaine.

22:18.680 --> 22:23.196
So, will the cover-up start now or somewhere
between here and the State Department?

22:23.280 --> 22:27.114
- You were saying about being honest?
- Yes. Regarding the bone shards...

22:27.200 --> 22:31.478
The prostitute was six inches taller
and she had occupationaI stress markers.

22:31.560 --> 22:36.031
Let's not call her a prostitute yet,
Mr Addy. What occupationaI markers?

22:36.120 --> 22:39.192
- It's a foot thing.
- She was a fetishist?

22:39.640 --> 22:43.633
Both her cuboid and mediaI
malleolus show signs of wear.

22:43.720 --> 22:47.554
You can relax, Dr Goodman. She
wore extremely high stiletto heels.

22:47.640 --> 22:50.757
I reconstructed her face
from the partiaI skull.

22:52.400 --> 22:56.234
- She was hot.
- What's our next move?

22:56.320 --> 23:02.350
We match this reconstruction with escort
ads, both internet and print, in the DC area.

23:02.440 --> 23:04.556
Oh, I'll do that.

23:04.640 --> 23:07.359
What? Was that overly enthusiastic?

23:07.440 --> 23:09.510
Thank you for the update.

23:09.600 --> 23:14.230
- This case continues to be your top priority?
- If I could suggest...

23:14.320 --> 23:19.633
Dr Brennan has been very clear
about your priorities on this, sir.

23:24.880 --> 23:25.915
What's that?

23:26.000 --> 23:29.037
The only Blackmantis wood
chipper in Virginia Beach.

23:29.120 --> 23:32.908
I got the records from the manufacturer
and traced it back to the yard.

23:33.000 --> 23:37.278
- We couldn't find any blood residue.
- That makes sense if the corpse was frozen.

23:37.360 --> 23:40.557
Yeah. Not to mention this has
ground up about 10,000 trees.

23:40.640 --> 23:43.871
I figured you could match the
blades to the cuts on the bones.

23:43.960 --> 23:47.999
Or do something I haven't thought of
much more confusing and scientific.

23:48.080 --> 23:50.071
Booth, you're working this case?

23:50.160 --> 23:53.311
Only two people have had
access to this machine.

23:53.400 --> 23:57.313
A foreman and a maintenance worker
named Ray Sparks. Sparks has ajacket.

23:57.400 --> 24:00.358
What do you say? You want to
come with me to go talk to him?

24:00.440 --> 24:03.159
Told you. It's a guy thing.

24:03.240 --> 24:05.708
- Yes, I'd like to come.
- All right. Here we go.

24:05.800 --> 24:09.554
Let Angela do the matching. I have
something more interesting for you.

24:09.640 --> 24:13.599
- More interesting than escorts?
- Run a dispersaI test on the chipper.

24:13.680 --> 24:17.719
- Using what medium?
- Assume the victim was frozen solid.

24:18.240 --> 24:20.800
- No way!
- Correct response would be "Yes way".

24:20.880 --> 24:23.553
Yes way.

24:28.560 --> 24:32.030
You ignore Zack to make him think
you've got some speciaI bond.

24:32.120 --> 24:35.396
- But it works. I'm happy, he's happy.
- It's not the truth.

24:35.480 --> 24:38.278
But it works. Ray Sparks, I'd
like to have a word with you.

24:38.360 --> 24:44.037
Zack wants to fit into the reaI world
more than anything. You're not helping.

24:44.120 --> 24:47.476
<i>FBI. SpeciaI Agent Booth.</i>

24:47.560 --> 24:50.154
He went around the back.

24:51.840 --> 24:54.229
No, no. The other way, Bones.

24:58.280 --> 25:00.350
FBI. Freeze.

25:02.280 --> 25:04.430
<i>Bones, jeez.</i>

25:04.520 --> 25:07.557
- Ray Sparks?
- Hey, I didn't do nothing wrong!

25:07.640 --> 25:13.510
- I feeI like kicking him.
- That's normaI after a pursuit. We try not to.

25:31.120 --> 25:33.315
How are we gonna keep
this from Dr Goodman?

25:33.400 --> 25:36.312
Ah, he's having lunch with
the president of Harvard.

25:36.400 --> 25:40.075
What's going on? Why is every guy
from the Jeffersonian out here?

25:40.160 --> 25:43.277
They're scientists. This
is a fascinating inquiry.

25:43.360 --> 25:44.679
Oh, my God.

25:44.760 --> 25:49.436
They're all out here because you're gonna
feed something through this wood chipper.

25:49.520 --> 25:50.999
Notjust something.

25:51.080 --> 25:53.435
Ta-da! A frozen pig!

25:53.520 --> 25:55.317
<i>Ugh.</i>

25:55.400 --> 25:58.119
Pig bones are almost
identicaI to human bones.

25:58.200 --> 26:02.557
By feeding the pig through the chipper
we can determine a dispersaI pattern.

26:02.640 --> 26:06.428
By comparing the pig's remains to
the fragments found at the golf course

26:06.520 --> 26:09.273
we'll know if this is the
chipper Max was fed through.

26:09.360 --> 26:15.754
Liars. You just want to see what happens
when you toss a pig into a wood chipper.

26:21.040 --> 26:23.713
<i>Ready? One!</i>

26:23.800 --> 26:25.199
Two!

26:25.280 --> 26:26.918
Three!

26:56.920 --> 27:01.152
OK. What do we got here? Breaking and
entering, assault, drunk, disorderly. Wow.

27:01.240 --> 27:04.516
I've been keeping myself out of
trouble for the past four years.

27:04.600 --> 27:08.434
- How long you been a maintenance worker?
- Since '92.

27:08.520 --> 27:12.035
- You ever meet a guy named Max Kane?
- No.

27:12.120 --> 27:14.554
- Karen Anderson?
- Yeah, I know her.

27:14.640 --> 27:17.438
- How?
- She bartends at the golf course.

27:17.520 --> 27:21.069
<i>You don't strike me as a golfer, Ray.</i>

27:24.280 --> 27:27.272
City land is right across
the creek from the course

27:27.360 --> 27:30.875
and I go to the clubhouse a
couple times a week to have lunch.

27:30.960 --> 27:34.236
How did you pay for that house
you live in? That's pretty nice.

27:34.320 --> 27:40.077
You got a hard time sticking to one
topic, huh? My mom left me the house.

27:40.160 --> 27:42.993
She left it to me and my
brother Frank five years ago.

27:43.080 --> 27:45.958
Five years ago Max Kane
disappeared. Karen's boyfriend.

27:46.040 --> 27:49.191
So you can see how my suspicions
might be a little aroused.

27:49.280 --> 27:55.230
You know, but the thing is, I didn't
live in Virginia Beach five years ago.

27:56.800 --> 28:00.759
I was in Southampton CorrectionaI Center

28:00.840 --> 28:04.515
doing six months for
skipping out on a DUl warrant.

28:06.400 --> 28:09.358
Guess I don't need a lawyer, right?

28:12.440 --> 28:16.353
There's no way that chipper experiment
was connected to the plane crash.

28:16.440 --> 28:19.193
- Look...
- Don't say anything. Just listen.

28:19.280 --> 28:23.193
Your primary job is to do as I say.
Failing that, yourjob is to fooI me.

28:23.280 --> 28:27.990
- You failed to fooI me, Dr Hodgins.
- I'd have fooled you if you'd gone to lunch.

28:28.080 --> 28:30.310
I'll find some way to punish you.

28:30.400 --> 28:34.188
Parking, dining privileges, budget
reviews. If it happens again...

28:34.280 --> 28:36.510
- I got it.
- No.

28:36.600 --> 28:38.716
You don't.

28:39.640 --> 28:42.950
You think I'm a kind and fair man.

28:43.040 --> 28:47.192
Egoless, balanced, ruled
by intelligent reflection.

28:47.280 --> 28:49.111
But I do have an ego.

28:49.200 --> 28:53.352
I can be vindictive and petty.

28:53.440 --> 28:56.193
I will take you down

28:56.280 --> 29:01.479
even if it means striking at you
through your friends and co-workers.

29:03.200 --> 29:05.395
Now you understand.

29:09.400 --> 29:12.153
Ray Sparks was in jaiI when
your father disappeared.

29:12.240 --> 29:14.879
He might have put Karen
in touch with the hit man.

29:14.960 --> 29:19.272
One of the things you lecture about is
that the simplest theory is usually true.

29:19.360 --> 29:22.750
- Usually, not always.
- What's the simplest theory in this case?

29:22.840 --> 29:25.991
Disowned son realises that
his father may remarry...

29:26.080 --> 29:30.119
Booth, are you accusing Jesse of
murdering his own father for money?

29:30.200 --> 29:33.715
- Ever hear of the Menendez brothers?
- I came to you about the bones.

29:33.800 --> 29:38.476
Your father is declared dead, you get your
inheritance before Karen spends it all.

29:38.560 --> 29:40.596
You don't seem too upset about that.

29:40.680 --> 29:43.831
For fours years I've been making
enemies with law enforcement.

29:43.920 --> 29:46.514
Attacking me is a
pretty typicaI response.

29:46.600 --> 29:49.876
Is this one of those times when
you just poke to get reactions?

29:49.960 --> 29:54.238
Listen, Bones. We have to treat him like
a suspect. He is not a member of the team.

29:54.320 --> 29:58.916
Look. I'm like you. I need the truth.

30:03.560 --> 30:05.949
I have to get back to the lab.

30:09.280 --> 30:11.555
Satellite imagery of the golf course.

30:11.640 --> 30:15.189
These three dots show where
the bone fragments were found.

30:15.280 --> 30:18.590
Can you show me the results
of the wood chipper test?

30:18.680 --> 30:22.992
The V shape indicates the maximum
distance a bone fragment could've travelled

30:23.080 --> 30:25.594
given similar wind
speeds and temperatures.

30:25.680 --> 30:29.719
OK, and remove the plane
crash. It's irrelevant to this.

30:29.800 --> 30:34.396
The question is, in order to use
the guys' pig-grinding experiment,

30:34.480 --> 30:36.596
where do we place the wood chipper?

30:36.680 --> 30:40.559
I bet the murderer aimed the
wood chipper over the stream.

30:40.640 --> 30:42.790
So the evidence would wash away.

30:42.880 --> 30:44.029
Mm-hm.

30:44.120 --> 30:45.951
What's that?

30:46.040 --> 30:49.350
That is a small access road
for maintenance vehicles.

30:49.440 --> 30:52.238
<i>Try putting the wood chipper there.</i>

30:52.320 --> 30:54.914
Oh, frisson of success.

30:55.000 --> 30:58.436
We should see if we can find any
more bone fragments here and here.

30:58.520 --> 31:01.592
Are we closer to identifying
our mystery woman?

31:01.680 --> 31:04.990
Um, I'm not... I'm not certain.

31:05.080 --> 31:08.436
- Brennan is still waiting for an update.
- I saw you come in, sir.

31:08.520 --> 31:11.990
I have a list of possible
matches on our geisha in the sky.

31:12.080 --> 31:15.755
She is Caucasian. Our mystery
woman is definitely Caucasian.

31:15.840 --> 31:18.195
We sent a list to the
FBI. They're checking it.

31:18.280 --> 31:24.833
Ah. Well, in that case, you might want to
turn your attention back to the bone fragments.

31:39.000 --> 31:42.117
I came for the file on my parents.

31:49.200 --> 31:53.432
- You think I might've killed my father.
- No. It's just...

31:54.720 --> 31:57.518
I asked the wrong
person to help me, and...

31:57.600 --> 32:00.353
What?

32:00.440 --> 32:05.309
I just don't think it's healthy, what you're
doing. Putting your whole life into this.

32:05.400 --> 32:07.914
And I suppose the way you're doing it,

32:08.000 --> 32:11.470
putting nothing into solving the
disappearance of your parents,

32:11.560 --> 32:14.518
I suppose that's healthy?

32:16.360 --> 32:21.150
We're searching the golf
course for more bone fragments.

33:13.600 --> 33:17.434
We found a piece of finger with
the naiI attached, and underneath...

33:17.520 --> 33:19.511
Polyurethane. The tough stuff.

33:19.600 --> 33:22.717
The victim was scraping at
something before he died.

33:22.800 --> 33:25.439
I can't identify this bone anomaly.

33:25.520 --> 33:30.469
It's full of osteoids, thick.
Maybe part of the mandible.

33:30.560 --> 33:33.438
Human, something odd
with the cell structure.

33:33.520 --> 33:37.798
<i>- A wood chipper wouldn't do that.
- It's a nonmalignant bone tumour.</i>

33:37.880 --> 33:41.555
I need the most recent bone scans
from Max Kane's medicaI records.

33:41.640 --> 33:42.868
Hodgins.

33:42.960 --> 33:44.951
It's Booth.

33:46.680 --> 33:49.831
The locals arrested Jesse
for attacking Karen Anderson.

33:49.920 --> 33:52.559
Jesse showed up at Karen's
house to confront her.

33:52.640 --> 33:57.794
He was ranting about his dad. Eddie tried
to throw him out. They exchanged punches.

33:57.880 --> 34:01.759
- That doesn't mean he isn't the killer.
- I know.

34:01.840 --> 34:06.868
He might have done this just to make us think
that he was angry at her, all right? He's smart.

34:06.960 --> 34:09.349
Do you think Jesse murdered his father?

34:09.440 --> 34:14.275
Bones, all I'm saying is we look into murders,
we can't let our heartstrings get all plucked.

34:14.360 --> 34:17.112
We poke at people's wounds,
make 'em bleed a little.

34:17.199 --> 34:20.431
Make 'em tell us things that
they normally wouldn't tell us.

34:20.520 --> 34:25.275
We gotta be willing to be hard on them, even
when we know we're no different than them.

34:25.360 --> 34:29.831
- You didn't answer my question.
- Well, I have an opinion. You want to know?

34:29.920 --> 34:32.309
- I'd say he didn't do it.
- Me too.

34:32.400 --> 34:35.755
I'm going off my gut. I mean,
what... what's persuading you?

34:35.840 --> 34:40.118
The bone fragments at the golf
course, they didn't come from Max Kane.

34:40.199 --> 34:43.397
That's great. You knew that
when you asked me what I thought.

34:43.480 --> 34:45.755
You testing out my instincts, Bones?

34:45.840 --> 34:48.308
Poking and prodding.

34:48.400 --> 34:50.755
I learned from the best.

34:55.239 --> 34:57.595
It's not my dad?

34:57.680 --> 35:01.559
- No. We don't know who it is yet.
- How can you be certain?

35:02.240 --> 35:06.791
We found ajuxtacorticaI chondroma,
a nonmalignant bone tumour.

35:06.880 --> 35:10.873
- Your dad's X-rays showed no sign of
one. - Maybe he got it after the X-rays.

35:10.960 --> 35:14.316
The X-rays were taken two
months before he disappeared.

35:14.400 --> 35:20.794
It's a slow-growing tumour. It would've taken
years to get to the size and density we found.

35:20.880 --> 35:26.876
Look, I'm gonna see if I can get this assault
stuff to go away and get you out of here.

35:28.160 --> 35:30.549
I'm sorry, Jesse.

35:30.640 --> 35:32.471
For what?

35:32.560 --> 35:35.199
Suspecting that I killed my own father?

35:35.280 --> 35:38.078
No. I'm not sorry for that.

35:41.880 --> 35:45.589
I know what it's like
not to know what happened.

35:46.840 --> 35:49.434
I know how painfuI that can be.

35:50.920 --> 35:53.195
And I'm sorry for you.

36:00.080 --> 36:02.514
If the bones aren't
Kane's who's our dead guy?

36:02.600 --> 36:07.390
Send out a description of the chondroma to
hospitals, see if it leads to missing patients.

36:07.480 --> 36:10.597
Yeah, we can do that.
List the pertinents.

36:10.680 --> 36:12.910
Me? Are you talking directly to me?

36:13.000 --> 36:16.595
Yeah. My eyes are looking at you,
my mouth is aimed in your direction.

36:16.680 --> 36:19.592
But what about our guy thing?
If you're speaking to me,

36:19.680 --> 36:21.750
then does this mean I'm not on the team?

36:21.840 --> 36:25.116
Zack, let's concentrate on the work.

36:25.200 --> 36:26.713
- Pertinents?
- Pertinents.

36:26.800 --> 36:31.351
The victim died. We don't know how. He was
frozen, dismembered with a carving knife

36:31.440 --> 36:34.000
and pushed through a
Blackmantis 1200 wood chipper.

36:34.080 --> 36:36.719
The exact chipper you fed
the frozen pig through.

36:36.800 --> 36:41.078
- The exact chipper Ray Sparks had access to.
- But Ray Sparks was in jaiI.

36:41.160 --> 36:44.516
- Ray was in jaiI when Max disappeared.
- Our victim isn't Max.

36:44.600 --> 36:47.160
Who else would Ray Sparks
have motive to kill?

36:47.240 --> 36:50.710
- The victim is a middle-aged
male... - His brother.

36:50.800 --> 36:53.268
- What motive?
- They both inherited the house.

36:53.360 --> 36:58.036
OK, you guys, you look at that tumour, and
Bones and I will go talk to Ray. Come on.

36:58.120 --> 37:02.079
- While you're there, look for a large freezer.
- Why?

37:02.160 --> 37:06.039
- The body was frozen.
- Polyurethane is a common liner in freezers.

37:06.120 --> 37:11.672
We found it under the victim's fingernaiI,
like he was scratching to get out.

37:15.120 --> 37:20.592
The detectives say Sparks claims his brother
was alive and well the last time he saw him.

37:20.680 --> 37:24.150
He might've been for 30 minutes
untiI he ran out of air in here.

37:24.240 --> 37:28.711
My guys found claw marks on
the inner linings on both sides.

37:28.800 --> 37:34.033
What kind of person could lock a
living human being in a freezer?

37:35.080 --> 37:37.799
<i>- What is that?
- A fingernaiI.</i>

37:39.640 --> 37:41.631
His own brother.

37:52.080 --> 37:53.513
Hey.

37:53.600 --> 37:55.511
Booth got you out.

37:55.600 --> 38:00.390
1200 bucks baiI. I promised to
stay away from Karen and Eddie.

38:00.480 --> 38:02.789
We solved the case.

38:03.600 --> 38:07.070
<i>I'm sorry it's not your father.</i>

38:09.000 --> 38:11.389
We identified the victim.

38:11.480 --> 38:14.153
His name was Frank Sparks.

38:16.480 --> 38:19.711
I'm sorry I couldn't help you, Jesse.

38:20.880 --> 38:23.189
How do you live with it?

38:23.280 --> 38:29.276
- What? The disappearance of my parents?
- The fact that nobody's looking.

38:30.800 --> 38:35.476
I never thought about it
that way untiI I met you.

38:37.920 --> 38:40.639
There's a Zen koan.

38:40.720 --> 38:45.077
It says that if you
want to find something,

38:45.160 --> 38:47.799
you have to stop looking.

38:48.800 --> 38:54.557
I can't do that. My dad's watching and
I don't want to disappoint him again.

39:05.760 --> 39:11.039
Even if you don't believe it, I know your
parents are somewhere proud of what you do.

39:13.480 --> 39:15.869
That's not rationaI but...

39:18.040 --> 39:20.429
I love the thought of that.

39:38.840 --> 39:41.912
- How did Jesse take it?
- Like an orphan.

39:42.720 --> 39:45.951
- What?
- That's just... That's a little poetic for you.

39:46.040 --> 39:48.952
I didn't mean it that way.

39:49.800 --> 39:54.237
<i>- I want to ask you a favour.
- Oh, jeez. Another favour.</i>

39:54.320 --> 39:58.871
I wonder if you wouldn't
mind taking a look at this.

39:58.960 --> 40:01.155
File on your parents?

40:02.240 --> 40:04.151
Yeah, OK.

40:04.240 --> 40:07.630
Do you want to think about
it? It's a pretty big favour.

40:07.720 --> 40:09.836
You'd do it for me.

40:09.920 --> 40:12.070
Yeah, I would.

40:13.440 --> 40:16.477
I'm proud you asked, Temperance.

40:17.280 --> 40:21.831
Uh, Dr Brennan? Uh, Angela wants to
know if we should order anything for you.

40:21.920 --> 40:25.276
No, I'm not staying. Thanks, Zack.

40:25.360 --> 40:30.275
Guess we caught another one,
right? All for one and one for all?

40:30.360 --> 40:36.674
I'll take a look at this and see what they
didn't give you, and I'll get back to you, OK?

40:36.760 --> 40:38.830
Back to ignoring Zack?

40:38.920 --> 40:42.799
All right, look. I know you don't
approve but, you know, it works for us.

40:42.880 --> 40:45.997
- It worked for him, so I...
- Yeah, I get it.

40:46.080 --> 40:48.958
And it... it's kinda sweet.

40:50.560 --> 40:53.836
Hey, you know, your
people are my people.

40:54.360 --> 40:57.238
I have "people"?

40:57.800 --> 40:59.392
Hey,

40:59.480 --> 41:01.471
I have people.

42:00.960 --> 42:03.793
