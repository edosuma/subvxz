WEBVTT

00:03.438 --> 00:05.527
Can I pour you some more wine?

00:05.570 --> 00:08.225
It comes from the grape
region of France.

00:08.269 --> 00:10.706
I think you'll find it pairs
well with food.

00:10.749 --> 00:13.752
Jeff, I've had cooked fish
in sauce before.

00:13.796 --> 00:15.798
But this? This is special.

00:15.841 --> 00:17.974
And served with rice!

00:18.018 --> 00:19.932
Thanks.
It's my mother's recipe.

00:19.976 --> 00:22.152
She was from the old country...
Florida.

00:22.196 --> 00:23.632
We thought it would be nice

00:23.675 --> 00:25.460
to have you guys over
for a dinner party.

00:25.503 --> 00:29.594
After all, you two have hosted
us for several thousand meals.

00:29.638 --> 00:32.032
We were nothing like this
when we were first newlyweds.

00:32.075 --> 00:33.468
It's true.

00:33.511 --> 00:35.948
I had to reform your
mother's party girl ways.

00:35.992 --> 00:37.559
That's not how it was.

00:37.602 --> 00:39.952
Your father was hopeless
when I met him.

00:39.996 --> 00:43.956
The house had no furniture.
He used a sock for underwear.

00:44.000 --> 00:46.350
And for a napkin,
he used whichever sock

00:46.394 --> 00:48.265
he wasn't using as underwear.

00:48.309 --> 00:50.137
Well, I wasn't
exactly hopeless...

00:50.180 --> 00:52.791
young C.I.A. agent in my prime?

00:52.835 --> 00:54.924
I was a physical specimen.

00:54.967 --> 00:58.145
Firm chest. Chestnut buttocks.
And my penis?

00:58.188 --> 01:01.931
A muscled servant ready to obey
my every command.

01:01.974 --> 01:03.280
Dad!

01:03.324 --> 01:04.977
I'm sorry, Hayley,
but these are facts.

01:05.021 --> 01:07.545
Francine was lucky she locked
me down when she did.

01:07.589 --> 01:09.417
That's not what you said
at the time.

01:09.460 --> 01:12.333
Remember the night of
the placemats conversation?

01:12.376 --> 01:15.118
Of course. That was the night
I won the big argument.

01:15.162 --> 01:17.164
I won the argument, Stan.

01:17.207 --> 01:21.168
The sweet man I married
admitted I was right.

01:21.211 --> 01:23.213
We should have placemats.

01:23.257 --> 01:25.607
Please. I remember exactly
how it happened.

01:25.650 --> 01:26.869
We were in the living room.

01:26.912 --> 01:28.653
Show me. Show me exactly.

01:28.697 --> 01:32.179
Maybe that'll jog
your thick memory.

01:32.222 --> 01:33.876
Was it my food?

01:33.919 --> 01:36.618
Did you have to serve
your mom's Florida Cursed Fish

01:36.661 --> 01:38.489
with Argument Sauce?

01:41.057 --> 01:44.147

02:11.043 --> 02:12.306
This was you...

02:12.349 --> 02:14.438
"I'm lucky to have a guy
like you, Stan.

02:14.482 --> 02:17.659
Thanks for putting up with me
even when I'm being ridiculous!"

02:17.702 --> 02:20.401
No. No! It was more like,

02:20.444 --> 02:23.186
"Francine, I've got
a lot to learn,

02:23.230 --> 02:25.232
but you're the best thing
in my life,

02:25.275 --> 02:26.885
and I just want
to make you happy."

02:26.929 --> 02:28.452
That does not sound like me.

02:28.496 --> 02:30.237
I remember it exactly.

02:30.280 --> 02:32.239
You were standing
right over there.

02:32.282 --> 02:34.260
You know what? There's a simple
way to settle this.

02:34.284 --> 02:36.243
Time travel.

02:36.286 --> 02:40.247
Oh, I wish I had a time machine
right now,

02:40.290 --> 02:43.250
so I could fast-forward
to when we get to the C.I.A.'s

02:43.293 --> 02:46.078
time machine,
and I'm proven right.

02:46.122 --> 02:48.777
Francine, it's like
a nine-second drive.

02:48.820 --> 02:51.693
Can't believe Hayley and Jeff
are having a dinner party

02:51.736 --> 02:53.216
the same night as mine.

02:53.260 --> 02:54.652
You could've invited them
anyway.

02:54.696 --> 02:56.239
No, they bring nothing
to the conversation.

02:56.263 --> 02:57.655
They're zeroes.

02:57.699 --> 02:59.285
Is anyone else even coming
to this party?

02:59.309 --> 03:00.658
Of course!

03:00.702 --> 03:02.965
Jurgen, Danuta, my various boys.

03:03.008 --> 03:05.097
Roger even RSVP'd "maybe."

03:05.141 --> 03:07.883
- Where is everybody?
- They're coming!

03:07.926 --> 03:09.145
They're just running late.

03:09.189 --> 03:10.929
Traffic is solid orange.

03:10.973 --> 03:12.409
Well, I'm starving.

03:12.453 --> 03:15.151
I'm digging into whatever
these fried balls are.

03:15.195 --> 03:17.501
Ugh. Klaus, what is in this?

03:17.545 --> 03:18.937
Skittles.

03:18.981 --> 03:20.548
Blue package.

03:23.768 --> 03:25.509
Do you always park here?

03:25.553 --> 03:27.792
Yeah. I did it once, and it
just kind of became my thing.

03:27.816 --> 03:29.905
I got the machine.
You know, it's interesting.

03:29.948 --> 03:31.341
We've had the tech for years,

03:31.385 --> 03:33.517
but Bullock insisted
we keep refining it

03:33.561 --> 03:36.216
till it was small enough to fit
in a chimpanzee's asshole.

03:36.259 --> 03:37.478
Why?

03:37.521 --> 03:38.846
That's how big
he wants everything.

03:38.870 --> 03:41.133
- So, where's the machine?
- It's in my butt.

03:41.177 --> 03:43.484
Does it have to be there
to work?

03:43.527 --> 03:45.790
Hmm. I guess not?

03:49.968 --> 03:51.492
Did you...?

03:51.535 --> 03:52.754
Yeah, yeah. I washed it. Yeah.

03:52.797 --> 03:54.538
So, the argument happened
the night

03:54.582 --> 03:56.932
when Rachel on <i>Friends
turned 30.</i>

03:56.975 --> 03:58.716
At least we can agree on that.

03:58.760 --> 04:01.110
Thursday nights back then,
we'd go over to Tuttle's.

04:01.153 --> 04:02.503
He's our oldest friend.

04:02.546 --> 04:05.157
We'd watch <i>Friends,
Inside Schwartz,</i>

04:05.201 --> 04:07.769
then we'd change the channel
to watch <i>Temptation Island</i>

04:07.812 --> 04:10.162
until Tuttle would say
he was too horny,

04:10.206 --> 04:11.792
and the show was
making him uncomfortable.

04:11.816 --> 04:13.557
Then, we'd change the channel
to <i>ER,</i>

04:13.601 --> 04:15.167
calm him down, and go home.

04:15.211 --> 04:16.778
Now, if we're traveling in time,

04:16.821 --> 04:18.997
we can't let our younger selves
see us.

04:19.041 --> 04:20.627
We could really mess up
the time stream...

04:20.651 --> 04:22.740
create alternate futures,
that kind of thing.

04:22.784 --> 04:25.308
The president is a dinosaur,
there's no Sinbad.

04:25.352 --> 04:26.962
In that case, I would hope

04:27.005 --> 04:29.834
President Brontosaurus
would appoint a new Sinbad.

04:29.878 --> 04:32.837
So, we go upstairs,
beam to that very night,

04:32.881 --> 04:36.580
right after <i>ER</i> ends, wait for
our young selves to come in,

04:36.624 --> 04:38.756
watch the argument,
figure out who's right,

04:38.800 --> 04:40.845
and then jump back to the future
for the apologies

04:40.889 --> 04:42.238
and the apology cake.

04:42.282 --> 04:43.848
Apology cake?

04:43.892 --> 04:45.589
Oh, you'll be baking one.

04:45.633 --> 04:46.851
The cake can be any flavor.

04:46.895 --> 04:48.766
The point's more
the humiliation.

04:48.810 --> 04:53.075
Oh, you're gonna be
the one humiliated, Stan.

04:53.118 --> 04:55.686
Fire that thing up,
and let's go.

04:58.254 --> 04:59.690
Wow. Remember this?

04:59.734 --> 05:01.823
That poster was so cool.

05:01.866 --> 05:03.215
Never saw the film.

05:03.259 --> 05:05.217
Shh! I hear ourselves.

05:05.261 --> 05:07.089
Should we find a better place
to hide?

05:07.132 --> 05:09.265
There's no... time.

05:09.309 --> 05:11.136
Wow.
I just love that show.

05:11.180 --> 05:13.095
Imagine having five friends!

05:13.138 --> 05:15.315
You have friends, Stan!

05:15.358 --> 05:18.013
I have three...
Dick and Sanders. Tuttle.

05:18.056 --> 05:20.842
And, well, I also have
my best friend...

05:20.885 --> 05:23.366
you, Francine.

05:23.410 --> 05:25.281
You know, I noticed
Tuttle's placemats.

05:25.325 --> 05:27.370
I used to think they were just
for show-offs.

05:27.414 --> 05:30.242
Now, I see they're an important
part of crumb management.

05:30.286 --> 05:32.636
You were right, Francine.
We should buy some placemats.

05:32.680 --> 05:34.421
Aww, Stan.

05:34.464 --> 05:35.987
I already did.

05:38.120 --> 05:40.949
Hey, roomies!
What are you spying on?

05:42.298 --> 05:46.215
Ahhhhhh!

05:46.258 --> 05:47.651
Oh, right.

05:47.695 --> 05:49.653
Our roommate, Radika.

05:49.697 --> 05:53.265
She was always doing laundry
at the most inconvenient times.

05:53.309 --> 05:55.964
Ugh. Could this <i>be
any worse?</i>

06:03.537 --> 06:05.147
Let's all put our guns away.

06:05.190 --> 06:06.757
We're you from the future.

06:06.801 --> 06:08.933
We traveled in time
and did everything perfectly.

06:08.977 --> 06:11.675
Except we forgot about Radika,
the tenant who used to rent

06:11.719 --> 06:13.460
what's now
Steve and Hayley's rooms.

06:13.503 --> 06:15.287
Who are Steve and Hayley?

06:15.331 --> 06:17.072
Who's this old lady?

06:17.115 --> 06:18.378
Please, honey.

06:18.421 --> 06:20.902
We look basically
exactly the same.

06:20.945 --> 06:24.209
Also, that hair doesn't work for
you the way you think it does.

06:24.253 --> 06:25.907
Shoot 'em, Stan! Shoot 'em!

06:25.950 --> 06:28.300
Hang on. Hang on.
Nobody needs to shoot anybody.

06:28.344 --> 06:30.128
We time traveled here
from the future,

06:30.172 --> 06:32.827
using C.I.A. technology,
to settle an argument.

06:32.870 --> 06:34.698
Francine, I'd die
to protect you,

06:34.742 --> 06:36.221
but this guy's story checks out.

06:36.265 --> 06:37.527
Radika, all this is kind of

06:37.571 --> 06:39.200
an American thing
you wouldn't understand.

06:39.224 --> 06:40.661
I'm from Ohio!

06:40.704 --> 06:41.923
Do I need to kill Radika?

06:41.966 --> 06:43.490
No, no. It's okay.

06:43.533 --> 06:46.144
Radika, does this honestly
seem like something

06:46.188 --> 06:49.844
you want to be involved with?

06:49.887 --> 06:51.454
Bye, Radika!

06:51.498 --> 06:53.500
You know, I always had
a little thing for Radika.

06:53.543 --> 06:58.374
So, you two came back in time
to settle an argument?

06:58.418 --> 07:02.160
And great news, I...
and therefore you... were right!

07:02.204 --> 07:03.466
Of course we were.

07:03.510 --> 07:05.163
We're friggin' Francine.

07:05.207 --> 07:07.557
Maybe you were right on
the details and the facts,

07:07.601 --> 07:10.342
but bigger picture,
I couldn't be more right.

07:10.386 --> 07:12.780
Look at this fine chunk
of manflesh.

07:12.823 --> 07:15.217
You were lucky to lock
this down, Francine.

07:15.260 --> 07:16.523
Uh, 'scuse me?

07:16.566 --> 07:18.220
This ain't exactly nothin'!

07:18.263 --> 07:20.918
Yeah, show her, Francine!

07:20.962 --> 07:24.748
Stan, look at that fine ass
and apologize.

07:24.792 --> 07:26.184
You want me to look at it?

07:26.228 --> 07:27.882
At least enough to be polite.

07:27.925 --> 07:29.536
As long as you guys are here,

07:29.579 --> 07:32.800
shall we rip a pitcher
of Franny's Crazy 'Ritas?

07:32.843 --> 07:34.517
They're called "crazy"
'cause I put so much

07:34.541 --> 07:36.194
alcohol and pills in 'em.

07:36.238 --> 07:41.983
Girl, I was you, I remember you,
and I love you.

07:42.026 --> 07:45.160
Gah, feel how firm
this couch is!

07:45.203 --> 07:46.770
You need to savor this.

07:46.814 --> 07:49.207
Over the years, it gets kind of
old and worked in.

07:49.251 --> 07:52.210
A lot of things get kind of old
and worked in.

07:52.254 --> 07:53.995
Excuse me?

07:54.038 --> 07:55.518
You know what, Stan?

07:55.562 --> 07:57.172
As long as I'm back here,

07:57.215 --> 07:59.827
I'm gonna go to Buckaroo's Pizza
one last time.

07:59.870 --> 08:02.394
Appreciate that place.
It's about to close.

08:02.438 --> 08:04.440
Oh, no!
What happens to Martino?

08:04.484 --> 08:06.181
if I know.

08:06.224 --> 08:09.227
When I get back, Stan, I hope
you're ready to apologize.

08:09.271 --> 08:10.664
Me, too.

08:10.707 --> 08:12.535
Dude, you're not gonna
accompany your lady?

08:12.579 --> 08:14.189
Nah. I'm gonna sit here
and enjoy

08:14.232 --> 08:16.408
the former firmness
of the couch,

08:16.452 --> 08:18.585
then maybe play
some Jurassic Park pinball.

08:18.628 --> 08:20.717
Great game. Never saw the movie.

08:23.720 --> 08:26.070
Roger, Klaus is losing it.

08:26.114 --> 08:27.594
No one's coming to his party.

08:27.637 --> 08:29.247
I'm paralyzed!

08:29.291 --> 08:31.815
Because he's Klaus, I know
no one else will show up.

08:31.859 --> 08:34.035
So that means I don't have
to come in a persona.

08:34.078 --> 08:35.602
I can come as myself.

08:35.645 --> 08:39.301
But who is that, Steve?
What does that mean?

08:39.344 --> 08:40.868
I don't know how Roger dresses.

08:40.911 --> 08:42.260
I don't know how Roger acts.

08:42.304 --> 08:46.264
I... I don't know Roger!

08:48.353 --> 08:49.833
Roger. Roger.

08:49.877 --> 08:51.269
We can do this.

08:51.313 --> 08:52.836
Because you know who this is?

08:52.880 --> 08:56.013
This vulnerable guy
I'm talking to?

08:56.057 --> 08:58.059
That's Roger.

08:58.102 --> 09:00.540
Roger's bald?

09:03.760 --> 09:05.632
So, I don't know
if you're allowed,

09:05.675 --> 09:08.417
but can you tell me anything
about the future?

09:08.460 --> 09:12.290
Oh, you've got lots of stuff
to look forward to.

09:12.334 --> 09:14.858
We go to Korea
to investigate rumors

09:14.902 --> 09:16.468
of a reinvented Noah's Ark.

09:16.512 --> 09:19.080
You bring James Garfield
back to life.

09:19.123 --> 09:20.951
You become a horse briefly.

09:20.995 --> 09:22.910
There's a salt mine
in our backyard.

09:22.953 --> 09:24.868
Do... Do we have any kids?

09:24.912 --> 09:26.304
Oh, yeah!

09:26.348 --> 09:28.524
We also have a talking fish
named Klaus,

09:28.568 --> 09:31.266
and an alien named Roger
lives with us.

09:31.309 --> 09:33.660
There's a koala named Reginald
for a while.

09:33.703 --> 09:35.400
Forget what happens to him.

09:35.444 --> 09:39.753
And then, there's Rogu,
who kind of came off of Roger.

09:39.796 --> 09:42.146
So, Rogu is Roger's baby?

09:42.190 --> 09:46.586
Not in the traditional sense,
but he does breastfeed him.

09:49.371 --> 09:54.115
So, I gotta say, I'm kind of
liking the sloppy,

09:54.158 --> 09:56.683
older thing you got going on,
Old Stan.

09:56.726 --> 09:58.641
- Oh, yeah?
- There's no term for this,

09:58.685 --> 10:02.863
but I've always been into
the bods of dads.

10:02.906 --> 10:05.343
- "Dad bod."
- Oh, my God, that's so funny.

10:05.387 --> 10:07.345
You're so funny.

10:07.389 --> 10:09.696
You are a dad, aren't you?

10:09.739 --> 10:11.915
Did you knock me up, Stan?

10:11.959 --> 10:13.308
I sure did.

10:13.351 --> 10:14.590
We have a daughter,
Hayley, and...

10:14.614 --> 10:15.789
Don't tell me their names.

10:15.832 --> 10:17.399
I don't wanna hear the names.

10:17.442 --> 10:20.707
Just tell me you knocked
me up real good.

10:20.750 --> 10:22.360
Maybe you shouldn't
get so close.

10:22.404 --> 10:24.754
Old Francine's already
pretty mad at me.

10:24.798 --> 10:26.166
She'll be even madder
if she heard me

10:26.190 --> 10:27.714
call her "Old Francine."

10:27.757 --> 10:30.325
That better be
our little secret, then.

10:30.368 --> 10:33.371
Maybe we should have
other secrets.

10:33.415 --> 10:36.200
We could even get Radika
in the mix...

10:36.244 --> 10:39.160
fully clothed and completely
off-limits to you, of course,

10:39.203 --> 10:42.816
but she'd be in the mix.

10:42.859 --> 10:44.948
Francine, I know
all I ever talk about

10:44.992 --> 10:47.124
is how I'm gonna kill
Osama bin Laden,

10:47.168 --> 10:49.387
but I'm also full of
a lot of love.

10:49.431 --> 10:54.001
And just as much as I want
to kill him, I love you.

10:54.044 --> 10:56.743
Whatever I did that you're mad
at me about in the future,

10:56.786 --> 10:58.179
I apologize.

10:58.222 --> 11:00.181
You were right, and I'm sorry.

11:00.224 --> 11:02.400
You're gonna have a great life.

11:02.444 --> 11:04.402
Enjoy every second of it.

11:04.446 --> 11:05.969
Is that Radika?

11:06.013 --> 11:09.103
Get in here, girl!

11:09.146 --> 11:11.975
What the...?
I should've known!

11:12.019 --> 11:13.237
You!

11:13.281 --> 11:15.631
How could I not see that coming?

11:15.675 --> 11:18.939
You pulled a classic
separation move on me!

11:18.982 --> 11:22.159
I taught us that...
to use against others!

11:22.203 --> 11:23.770
We never made that deal!

11:23.813 --> 11:25.380
Share your man!

11:25.423 --> 11:27.338
Are... Are you mad
about this, me?

11:27.382 --> 11:28.600
Not really.

11:28.644 --> 11:30.124
I mean, if you're me,

11:30.167 --> 11:32.213
then I'm about to have sex
for the eighth time!

11:32.256 --> 11:34.389
That's a healthy attitude.

11:34.432 --> 11:37.784
Wanna come over here and give me
a double extra good-time,

11:37.827 --> 11:39.437
Stanning?

11:39.481 --> 11:41.613
See if you can make your wangs
meet in the middle.

11:41.657 --> 11:44.051
Staniel, may I see you
in the kitchen?

11:44.094 --> 11:47.271
- Which one of...
- You!

11:47.315 --> 11:48.708
I can't believe you.

11:48.751 --> 11:51.667
Cheating on me the first
second you get a chance?

11:51.711 --> 11:53.495
Yeah, but cheating on you
with you.

11:53.538 --> 11:54.844
That's romantic.

11:54.888 --> 11:56.716
I have an idea.

11:56.759 --> 11:59.806
What if both Francines cool off
with a hot steamy shower...

11:59.849 --> 12:03.026
You know what?
If you love the past so much,

12:03.070 --> 12:06.769
you can stay here until
you've learned your lesson.

12:06.813 --> 12:09.946
Why don't you keep him if you
want him so much, young me?

12:09.990 --> 12:11.295
I'm going back to the present.

12:11.339 --> 12:12.775
Wait, Francine.

12:12.819 --> 12:15.038
You can't leave two Stans
here in one timeline.

12:15.082 --> 12:17.084
What if we kiss,
and can't stop kissing?

12:17.127 --> 12:19.913
Fine. I'm taking the Stan
I like better.

12:19.956 --> 12:23.264
Goodbye, Stan.

12:23.307 --> 12:25.483
Okay. All right. No problem.

12:25.527 --> 12:28.008
I still have you in your prime.

12:28.051 --> 12:29.487
Now, where were we?

12:29.531 --> 12:32.534
Actually, some of the stuff
old me was saying

12:32.577 --> 12:33.840
sounded kind of bad.

12:33.883 --> 12:35.319
Don't listen to her.
She's crazy.

12:35.363 --> 12:38.322
- She's me!
- I-I meant crazy in a cool way.

12:38.366 --> 12:40.672
<i>Cool Runnings.
Is that from now?</i>

12:40.716 --> 12:44.502
I'd be pretty mad if you slept
with 20-years-ago me.

12:44.546 --> 12:47.027
- She'd be 8.
- Exactly, you perv!

12:47.070 --> 12:50.334
I'm gonna crash at Trish's
until I find my own place.

12:50.378 --> 12:53.860
Good luck, Stan.

12:53.903 --> 12:56.340
Santa? Oh.

12:59.256 --> 13:01.041
Mr. and Mrs. S.

13:01.084 --> 13:04.305
You decided to return
for hookah, figs,

13:04.348 --> 13:05.741
and apricot brandy.

13:05.785 --> 13:08.352
Hayley, your father and I
went back in time

13:08.396 --> 13:09.876
to settle our argument,

13:09.919 --> 13:12.748
but then, your dad
acted like a jackass,

13:12.792 --> 13:15.882
so I left him back there
and gave myself an upgrade.

13:15.925 --> 13:18.580
Meet your new dad, Young Dad.

13:18.623 --> 13:20.712
- Whoa.
- Hi.

13:20.756 --> 13:21.931
You're my daughter?

13:21.975 --> 13:23.933
You messed with the time stream?

13:23.977 --> 13:26.196
I feel myself fading away!

13:26.240 --> 13:28.285
Jeff, that doesn't make sense.

13:28.329 --> 13:30.113
Dad's not your dad.

13:30.157 --> 13:32.637
But how come I still exist?

13:32.681 --> 13:34.726
You're already conceived,
somewhere back there.

13:34.770 --> 13:35.945
In that case, I'm good.

13:35.989 --> 13:37.555
Nice to meet you, Young Dad.

13:37.599 --> 13:38.861
What's your favorite band?

13:38.905 --> 13:41.168
Tie... Evanescence and Wheatus.

13:41.211 --> 13:43.213
We're gonna be all right.

13:43.257 --> 13:45.912
Now, because we did
mess up time,

13:45.955 --> 13:48.566
I'm not sure if Steve
will still be here,

13:48.610 --> 13:51.352
which means you'll
have to be the one

13:51.395 --> 13:53.180
who remembers
the wi-fi password.

13:53.223 --> 13:54.572
Steve!

13:54.616 --> 13:56.748
This is a young version
of your dad.

13:56.792 --> 13:58.315
He'll be your new father.

13:58.359 --> 14:00.535
Wait. Does this mean
I won't exist?

14:00.578 --> 14:02.580
Either we'll eventually
conceive you,

14:02.624 --> 14:04.365
or you'll start to fade away

14:04.408 --> 14:06.541
into non-existence
as time changes.

14:06.584 --> 14:09.544
Well, at least that would get me
out of Klaus' dinner party.

14:09.587 --> 14:11.589
- Who's Klaus again?
- Don't worry about Klaus.

14:11.633 --> 14:13.156
Klaus is nobody.

14:13.200 --> 14:17.769
Well, Young Dad, allow me
to introduce you to Roger.

14:17.813 --> 14:19.902
Hi. I'm Roger.

14:19.946 --> 14:21.773
Stan, you're gonna meet me
in Utah

14:21.817 --> 14:24.646
about 12 years ago,
my past, your future.

14:24.689 --> 14:27.257
We made a beautiful
sound together.

14:28.998 --> 14:30.608
Was that a space alien?

14:30.652 --> 14:32.697
Who could that be?

14:41.445 --> 14:42.794
Oh, hey, Radika.

14:42.838 --> 14:44.274
Sorry it's a little messy
in here.

14:44.318 --> 14:46.624
I'm just going hog
on the bachelor lifestyle.

14:46.668 --> 14:51.803
So, it's looking like Francine's
not coming back, huh?

14:51.847 --> 14:53.849
What's it been,
like, two months?

14:53.893 --> 14:55.198
Two months, six days.

14:55.242 --> 14:56.634
Yeah, don't think she's coming.

14:56.678 --> 14:59.202
But it's cool.
I'm enjoying... all this.

14:59.246 --> 15:01.422
Plus, I'm about to win
big gambling.

15:01.465 --> 15:02.945
I know the Cincinnati Bagels

15:02.989 --> 15:04.816
win the Super Bowl
one of these years.

15:04.860 --> 15:06.688
- The Bengals?
- Yeah, maybe.

15:06.731 --> 15:09.256
Well, I'm sure
you'll find someone else.

15:09.299 --> 15:11.040
You're a catch, Stan.

15:11.084 --> 15:14.522
Thanks. But it's just so hard
to meet new people, Radika.

15:14.565 --> 15:17.786
Pssh, you're telling me.

15:17.829 --> 15:19.831
<i>Flips it downfield!</i>

15:19.875 --> 15:21.442
<i>Knocked away!</i>

15:30.016 --> 15:33.845
Somewhere inside me, I think
I always knew this was right.

15:33.889 --> 15:35.673
Me too, Stan.

15:35.717 --> 15:38.198
There's so much I love
about you.

15:38.241 --> 15:41.418
And the things I don't love
I know I can fix.

15:41.462 --> 15:43.507
Because you don't need
placemats!

15:43.551 --> 15:45.379
Why would we have something
we don't need?

15:45.422 --> 15:47.511
Why did I think
this was a good idea?

15:47.555 --> 15:49.209
My mother warned me.

15:49.252 --> 15:52.038
Why did I marry
an old C.I.A. agent

15:52.081 --> 15:53.735
who spent all of our savings

15:53.778 --> 15:55.650
betting on
the Cincinnati Bengals

15:55.693 --> 15:57.086
to win the Super Bowl?!

15:57.130 --> 15:59.262
They win one of these years,
I swear!

15:59.306 --> 16:02.048
I remember tears of joy
on Carson Palmer's face!

16:02.091 --> 16:03.658
He was kissing his little boy.

16:03.701 --> 16:05.877
This isn't working out, Stan.

16:05.921 --> 16:08.402
- Fine.
- Fine!

16:08.445 --> 16:11.492
<i>Maybe I messed up
when I lost Francine.</i>

16:11.535 --> 16:14.538
<i>Maybe she was the best thing
that ever happened to me.</i>

16:14.582 --> 16:16.279
<i>No, no, no. I'm fine.</i>

16:16.323 --> 16:18.499
<i>I'm still a cool single guy!</i>

16:18.542 --> 16:19.935
<i>You know, I always regretted</i>

16:19.979 --> 16:21.719
<i>never doing a year as a ski bum.</i>

16:21.763 --> 16:23.286
<i>Maybe I'll try that.</i>

16:23.330 --> 16:26.072
So, are you interested
in buying this one, or...?

16:26.115 --> 16:27.551
Nah. Motorcycles
aren't for me.

16:27.595 --> 16:29.075
Way too dangerous.

16:31.120 --> 16:32.339
Cool. You're all set.

16:32.382 --> 16:33.620
Have a great day
on the mountain.

16:33.644 --> 16:35.603
Gustin. Marlowe. Gustin!

16:35.646 --> 16:38.649
I didn't buy you two $400
Helly Hanson jackets

16:38.693 --> 16:39.931
so you could just
sit in the lodge.

16:39.955 --> 16:41.174
- Let's move.
- Roger?

16:41.217 --> 16:42.827
Hmm? You're confused.

16:42.871 --> 16:46.092
I'm Doctor Steele Birchington,
Houston cardiac surgeon.

16:46.135 --> 16:48.311
I've put in over 600 stents.

16:48.355 --> 16:51.097
Gustin! Gustin, stay in line.

16:51.140 --> 16:53.273
No, Roger, it's me, Stan.

16:53.316 --> 16:56.537
You don't know me yet,
or maybe we never met, but...

16:56.580 --> 16:58.278
God, it's so good
to see a friend!

16:58.321 --> 16:59.757
What're you talking about?

16:59.801 --> 17:01.039
You know what?
What'd you say your name is?

17:01.063 --> 17:02.804
Stan? I'm ready for a change.

17:02.847 --> 17:04.066
What's your thing, old man?

17:04.110 --> 17:05.720
You're too old to be a ski bum.

17:05.763 --> 17:08.070
Yeah, I was thinking about
starting a coffee shop.

17:08.114 --> 17:09.332
Maybe learn guitar.

17:09.376 --> 17:10.812
I'm in. Goodbye, kids.

17:10.855 --> 17:12.398
Tell your mother I was sleeping
with Paolo

17:12.422 --> 17:14.033
from photography class.

17:21.997 --> 17:24.565
♪ <i>Gonna take some time
to do the things ♪</i>

17:24.608 --> 17:29.352
♪ <i>We never haa-aa-aad!</i> ♪

17:34.183 --> 17:36.533
Stan, we're locking in
on a sound, here.

17:36.577 --> 17:38.796
We could be a credible
Toto cover band.

17:38.840 --> 17:40.059
No.

17:40.102 --> 17:41.277
No. This isn't right.

17:41.321 --> 17:42.601
We're sounding better than ever,

17:42.626 --> 17:44.585
but nothing feels right.

17:44.628 --> 17:46.674
I blew it when I lost Francine.

17:46.717 --> 17:49.068
What're you talking about?
You've got Amanda now.

17:51.635 --> 17:53.159
It's not the same.

17:53.202 --> 17:54.769
I've been going through life

17:54.812 --> 17:57.206
with nothing to keep me company
but regret.

17:57.250 --> 17:59.252
Uh, okay.

17:59.295 --> 18:03.212
Is there any way to fix my life?

18:03.256 --> 18:06.041
And so, I waited until now,
Francine.

18:06.085 --> 18:08.391
Life was so dreary without you.

18:08.435 --> 18:10.611
Sure, I got to witness
the 2008 Olympic

18:10.654 --> 18:12.178
opening ceremonies again.

18:12.221 --> 18:14.397
Incredible, Francine,
the precision.

18:14.441 --> 18:16.399
But it wasn't worth it.

18:16.443 --> 18:18.184
Life without you was hollow.

18:18.227 --> 18:20.011
I had years to think on it.

18:20.055 --> 18:23.189
I realized that, maybe,
just maybe, if I could wait

18:23.232 --> 18:26.017
until tonight... the very night
when we went back in time

18:26.061 --> 18:27.628
because of my stupid pride...

18:27.671 --> 18:30.457
maybe there'd be a chance
to salvage some of my life.

18:30.500 --> 18:33.895
So, you relived
the last 20 years?

18:33.938 --> 18:36.550
Not quite.
Young Francine left me.

18:36.593 --> 18:37.812
She married Principal Lewis.

18:37.855 --> 18:39.379
Ooh, nice.

18:39.422 --> 18:40.834
And she had this great group
of girlfriends, too.

18:40.858 --> 18:42.208
If one of them needed something,

18:42.251 --> 18:43.663
the other ones were,
like, always there.

18:43.687 --> 18:45.602
They were, like,
closer than sisters.

18:45.646 --> 18:47.058
There was some drama
when Lillian was

18:47.082 --> 18:48.451
getting married again,
and it was like,

18:48.475 --> 18:50.195
"Does she deserve
a second bachelorette..."

18:51.217 --> 18:53.219
- No!
- What's happening?

18:53.262 --> 18:55.046
I heard something,
so I started shooting.

18:55.090 --> 18:56.918
That's you!

18:56.961 --> 19:01.836
This beautiful, special woman
is yours now, young Stan.

19:01.879 --> 19:04.447
Don't make the mistake I did.

19:04.491 --> 19:06.623
Don't live your life
full of regret.

19:08.712 --> 19:10.932
Oh, Stan!

19:10.975 --> 19:13.108
No. No. This isn't right.

19:13.152 --> 19:15.893
We can't let this happen
to this pathetic old man.

19:15.937 --> 19:18.026
Where are we going?

19:18.069 --> 19:20.594
Back in time.

19:20.637 --> 19:22.248
Guests!

19:22.291 --> 19:24.206
People came!

19:24.250 --> 19:26.077
And look at you, Roger.

19:26.121 --> 19:29.211
What outrageous persona
are you presenting?

19:29.255 --> 19:32.432
Klaus, I'd like you
to meet Roger.

19:32.475 --> 19:33.694
Hi. I'm Roger.

19:33.737 --> 19:35.478
I like baseball and musicals.

19:35.522 --> 19:39.482
Nice to meet you, Roger.

19:39.526 --> 19:41.876
I'm so sorry we're late, Klaus.

19:41.919 --> 19:43.573
Traffic was solid orange.

19:43.617 --> 19:46.272
I can't believe this.
People came!

19:46.315 --> 19:51.102
Everyone, I'd like to introduce
you to someone. This is...

19:51.146 --> 19:54.889
Demetrius Fitzpatio,
chiropractor to the stars!

19:57.544 --> 20:00.590
Who am I?

20:00.634 --> 20:04.942
Oh, I wish I had a time machine
right now,

20:04.986 --> 20:07.902
so I could fast-forward
to when we get to the C.I.A.'s

20:07.945 --> 20:10.905
time machine,
and I'm proven right.

20:10.948 --> 20:14.169
Francine, it's like
a nine-second drive.

20:14.213 --> 20:16.127
- Ahhh!
- Looking for this?

20:16.171 --> 20:17.520
Don't do it, Stan.

20:17.564 --> 20:18.956
Let go of your pride.

20:19.000 --> 20:20.958
It's not worth
losing Francine over.

20:21.002 --> 20:23.134
Don't worry, sweetie. I'm you.

20:23.178 --> 20:24.919
We're doing great.

20:24.962 --> 20:26.486
You win the argument.

20:26.529 --> 20:29.228
Appreciate what you have, Stan.

20:32.579 --> 20:34.145
Do you know what that was about?

20:34.189 --> 20:36.191
No. But you know what?

20:36.235 --> 20:38.149
Maybe we don't go back in time.

20:38.193 --> 20:39.760
I'm sure you were right.

20:39.803 --> 20:42.153
Whatever happened in the past,
it brought us here.

20:42.197 --> 20:43.372
That's right.

20:43.416 --> 20:45.287
And it's pretty nice, isn't it?

20:45.331 --> 20:47.115
It's beautiful.

20:47.158 --> 20:49.354
Did you know Klaus was also
having a dinner party tonight?

20:49.378 --> 20:51.511
Motherdidn't invite us!

20:51.554 --> 20:52.773
We could go back and ruin it.

20:52.816 --> 20:54.296
Beats Jeff's figs.

20:54.340 --> 20:56.211
That's not dessert.

20:56.255 --> 20:58.213
Bye! Have a beautiful time!
