00:12.364 --> 00:13.729
Right now

00:13.832 --> 00:17.768
terrorists are plotting to assassinate
a presidential candidate.

00:17.869 --> 00:20.429
My wife and daughter have been targeted

00:20.539 --> 00:24.066
and people that I work with may be
involved in both.

00:24.943 --> 00:27.002
I'm Federal Agent Jack Bauer

00:27.112 --> 00:30.809
and today is the longest day of my llfe.

00:50.635 --> 00:53.763
First time you invited me back here,
you left your keys in my car.

00:53.905 --> 00:55.805
It was pouring rain.

00:56.174 --> 00:58.574
We didn't want to run back, so...

01:00.045 --> 01:02.013
...we used your hide-a-key.

01:24.069 --> 01:25.502
What do I do?

01:26.338 --> 01:27.635
I don't know what to do.

01:27.739 --> 01:31.470
- I don't know what the code is.
- Just take your time. it'll come to you.

01:35.146 --> 01:36.909
Just make this stop!

01:50.428 --> 01:51.486
Hello?

01:51.596 --> 01:52.893
This is Superior Alarm.

01:52.998 --> 01:54.329
Could you please turn this off?

01:54.432 --> 01:55.660
I need your password.

01:57.802 --> 01:59.929
Ma'am, what is your password?

02:00.038 --> 02:02.029
I don't know the password.

02:02.140 --> 02:04.370
Are you having an emergency?

02:05.410 --> 02:07.310
Alan Morgan, Saugus.

02:09.413 --> 02:11.507
Got it. All right, thanks.

02:13.351 --> 02:14.249
Jack.

02:15.053 --> 02:18.682
His name was Alan Morgan.
He works for Pacific Electric in Saugus.

02:18.790 --> 02:19.757
Saugus?

02:20.025 --> 02:23.051
He was paid off by Alexis to kill
the power in part of the grid.

02:23.161 --> 02:26.153
- Did you get the coordinates? 26, GG.
- GG, yes.

02:26.298 --> 02:27.925
We need to know where that is.

02:28.033 --> 02:29.660
Okay. Should I stick around?

02:29.834 --> 02:32.200
No. Get a hold of me
when you have something.

02:32.304 --> 02:34.738
- See you back at the office.
- Thank you.

02:37.742 --> 02:39.141
None of these are working.

02:40.312 --> 02:42.143
Superior Alarm. Stay where you are.

02:42.247 --> 02:43.339
Please.

02:43.448 --> 02:45.416
This woman lives here.

02:45.517 --> 02:46.745
She forgot her code.

03:05.170 --> 03:07.070
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

03:07.205 --> 03:08.695
- Teri Bauer?
- Yes.

03:08.807 --> 03:10.365
Do you have any ID?

03:12.577 --> 03:13.544
Sure.

03:13.712 --> 03:17.011
It's probably in my purse. I'll go check.

03:40.705 --> 03:42.400
No ID necessary.

03:42.507 --> 03:44.441
You obviously live here.

03:45.009 --> 03:47.273
She just couldn't remember her code.

03:48.346 --> 03:50.280
I don't usually set it.

03:50.382 --> 03:53.545
- My daughter must have.
- It's all right. Just sign this.

03:59.524 --> 04:02.288
Okay. I'm going to reset the alarm...

04:02.394 --> 04:04.760
...and check the contacts
outside the house.

04:04.863 --> 04:07.593
- That should take about 15 minutes.
- Thank you.

04:11.169 --> 04:12.500
Thank you.

04:43.168 --> 04:44.533
Nice. Have you noticed...

04:44.636 --> 04:47.434
...how there's always a body count
everywhere you go?

04:47.539 --> 04:49.700
I gave Hanlin clear orders not to shoot.

04:49.808 --> 04:52.368
- Where'd he go?
- He's over there.

04:54.879 --> 04:57.245
- Bauer.
- Jack, it's David Palmer.

04:57.348 --> 04:58.508
Yes, Senator?

04:58.783 --> 05:01.411
I just heard back from my source
at the Pentagon.

05:01.519 --> 05:04.079
It wasn't easy to get a hold
of the missing Drazen file.

05:04.189 --> 05:06.657
- What was in it?
- Dates and locations.

05:06.758 --> 05:10.694
It seems to relate to the last months
of Victor Drazen's life.

05:10.795 --> 05:13.423
- Anything we can use?
- Maybe.

05:13.731 --> 05:18.134
The last entry is an address unrelated
to everything else.

05:18.369 --> 05:19.495
What is it?

05:19.604 --> 05:21.003
21911 Kipling...

05:21.105 --> 05:24.541
...in a city called Saugus.
I don't know where that is.

05:24.642 --> 05:26.872
I'm sorry, Senator.
Did you just say "Saugus"?

05:26.978 --> 05:28.206
Does that mean anything?

05:28.313 --> 05:29.803
Yes. I'll get back to you.

05:29.914 --> 05:31.745
Thank you. This is going to help.

05:31.850 --> 05:33.147
All right.

05:39.224 --> 05:40.282
CTU. Almeida.

05:40.391 --> 05:43.360
- Tony, take down this address for me.
- Go ahead.

05:43.461 --> 05:47.591
21911 Kipling Avenue in Saugus.

05:47.866 --> 05:50.596
It should be in the grid coordinates
Nina just gave you.

05:50.702 --> 05:51.760
All right, hang on.

06:00.578 --> 06:01.909
Yes, you're right.

06:02.213 --> 06:04.181
It's right in the middle of Sector 26, GG.

06:04.282 --> 06:06.648
Find out what's there.
Get back to me on my cell.

06:06.985 --> 06:08.009
All right.

06:10.021 --> 06:11.750
Where you headed?

06:12.624 --> 06:14.114
I'm going to Saugus.

06:14.225 --> 06:17.422
Alexis paid this guy to knock the power out
at one address there.

06:17.529 --> 06:19.690
- I want to know why.
- Slow down, Jack.

06:19.797 --> 06:22.061
I'm on your side. Fill me in.

06:23.968 --> 06:25.458
Two and a half hours ago...

06:25.937 --> 06:28.098
...Robert Ellis was killed in New Orleans...

06:28.206 --> 06:30.003
...because he almost learned this address.

06:30.108 --> 06:31.837
We got the address from the Drazen file.

06:31.943 --> 06:33.672
The Senator just gave it to me.

06:34.812 --> 06:37.508
- Let's go.
- What do you mean, "let's"?

06:37.615 --> 06:40.277
If you want to go, I'm your chaperone.
You want a ride?

06:46.925 --> 06:47.983
Yes.

06:48.860 --> 06:49.849
Hop in.

06:59.537 --> 07:01.334
- Where's my brother?
- I don't know.

07:01.439 --> 07:03.634
If I don't have that money in 20 minutes...

07:03.741 --> 07:05.208
I told you, we split up.

07:05.310 --> 07:07.904
He said he'd meet me here
with the payoff from Gaines.

07:08.947 --> 07:11.609
If I was ripping you off,
why would I come back here?

07:12.750 --> 07:13.739
Damn it!

07:15.053 --> 07:17.112
- Where you going?
- Don't worry.

07:18.389 --> 07:20.789
- What are you doing?
- I'm not waiting to get killed.

07:20.892 --> 07:22.223
- You're not leaving.
- Melanie!

07:22.327 --> 07:23.988
She'll tell the police about the deal.

07:24.095 --> 07:27.758
I don't care about the deal.
I thought you'd help me find my mom.

07:27.865 --> 07:30.333
- But obviously that was dumb.
- You came here for Rick.

07:30.435 --> 07:32.960
- I did not.
- Kim, don't worry about her. Just leave.

07:33.071 --> 07:35.005
What do you mean
don't worry about me?

07:35.573 --> 07:37.063
- Come with me.
- I can't.

07:37.175 --> 07:39.439
It'll be better out there than in here.

07:39.544 --> 07:42.411
You heard Frank.
Nobody goes anywhere until Dan gets back.

07:42.513 --> 07:44.378
Dan is not coming back.

07:46.150 --> 07:47.742
What do you mean?

07:50.722 --> 07:53.088
I don't know, I just...

07:53.191 --> 07:54.783
- What do you mean?
- I just...

07:54.892 --> 07:57.087
- Leave her alone.
- Where is he?

08:00.298 --> 08:01.595
He's dead.

08:02.600 --> 08:04.090
What are you talking about?

08:04.369 --> 08:06.769
Gaines killed him.
He was going to kill me, too.

08:06.871 --> 08:09.931
I swear to God, Frank.
This guy, Gaines, was out of control.

08:33.765 --> 08:36.756
- Who's got the money now?
- Nobody.

08:37.635 --> 08:39.102
Gaines never paid us.

08:47.145 --> 08:49.875
These guys are going to be here
in a half an hour.

08:50.014 --> 08:53.177
These are not the kind of guys
you can break a deal with.

08:53.284 --> 08:55.809
- Then call it off.
- It's too late to call it off!

09:37.495 --> 09:39.827
What are you going to say
down there today?

09:44.368 --> 09:46.700
- He's going to tell the truth.
- Don't you start, Keith.

09:46.804 --> 09:49.329
- You've caused enough pain.
- Sherry!

09:49.440 --> 09:52.568
I'm sorry, David, but somebody
has to say the words.

09:52.677 --> 09:55.771
This whole thing wouldn't have started
if Keith hadn't decided...

09:55.880 --> 09:58.371
...to take matters into his own hands.

09:59.350 --> 10:00.783
Listen to me.

10:02.620 --> 10:04.383
Nobody's defending what Keith did.

10:05.957 --> 10:07.891
He acted on the moment.
It wasn't right.

10:08.793 --> 10:11.091
That doesn't make you right
for covering it up.

10:11.195 --> 10:13.060
Doesn't make me rlght for not being there.

10:14.065 --> 10:17.557
So we're all to blame.
Let's just leave it at that.

10:19.070 --> 10:22.699
That's right, Mom.
I'm willing to pay the price for this.

10:22.807 --> 10:24.741
Even if it means going to jail.

10:25.676 --> 10:28.702
You still think this is just about you,
don't you?

10:29.747 --> 10:33.114
When are you going to get it
through your head...

10:33.885 --> 10:38.117
...that your father is running
for President of the United States?

10:38.489 --> 10:39.854
A black man.

10:40.124 --> 10:44.083
You don't just decide
to ease your conscience...

10:44.195 --> 10:46.959
...at the cost of what might be best
for this country.

10:47.064 --> 10:49.430
- I didn't, Mom.
- Both of you, calm down.

10:55.606 --> 10:57.164
I kept it inside.

10:57.975 --> 11:00.637
I was willing to suck it up
for as long as it took.

11:01.379 --> 11:03.745
But someone murdered Dr. Ferragamo
this morning...

11:03.848 --> 11:06.908
...and you can't tell me to hide that
for the good of the country.

11:07.018 --> 11:08.349
You know what?

11:09.587 --> 11:12.021
I never saw it until just this minute.

11:12.657 --> 11:14.420
You're your father's son.

11:15.159 --> 11:19.562
You cover up your weakness with a bunch
of bleeding-heart sentimentality.

11:19.664 --> 11:21.632
- That's enough.
- Am I wrong?

11:21.732 --> 11:25.862
When are you going to be man enough
to do what it takes to be President?

11:25.970 --> 11:27.198
Nicole, are you okay?

11:28.906 --> 11:31.966
- What's wrong? Honey?
- Nicole!

11:32.076 --> 11:34.476
Keith, get me some water.

11:35.246 --> 11:36.270
Come on.

11:36.380 --> 11:38.143
We need a doctor in here.

11:45.022 --> 11:46.614
Easy, relax.

11:46.724 --> 11:48.453
Come here. Give me your hands.

11:58.336 --> 12:00.167
I'm so sorry, Daddy.

12:00.271 --> 12:02.899
What? Sorry about what?

12:05.443 --> 12:07.172
Honey, talk to me.

12:12.283 --> 12:13.910
This is all my fault.

12:14.185 --> 12:17.712
Don't you ever say that.
No, sweetheart, don't you say that.

12:17.822 --> 12:19.483
Everything's going to be fine.

12:27.398 --> 12:30.162
- I'm sorry, Daddy.
- No, honey.

12:30.268 --> 12:32.600
I'm sorry.

12:34.639 --> 12:35.901
I just got in.

12:36.007 --> 12:38.407
I've got some more info
on that location in Saugus.

12:38.509 --> 12:39.976
Okay, hold on.

12:41.178 --> 12:42.110
Okay, go.

12:42.213 --> 12:44.408
Comes up as a wildlife preserve.

12:44.515 --> 12:46.676
Great, we're going to
a Sierra Club meeting.

12:46.784 --> 12:47.944
Who's with you?

12:48.052 --> 12:50.486
Mason. A wildlife preserve in Saugus?

12:50.588 --> 12:53.921
That doesn't make sense. Saugus is
industrial. What about GPS maps?

12:54.592 --> 12:55.752
I've got three on the way.

12:55.860 --> 12:59.057
Good work. We'll call you
when we find out what's out there.

12:59.163 --> 13:00.494
Yeah, okay.

13:06.370 --> 13:07.598
Correct me if I'm wrong...

13:07.705 --> 13:10.936
...but what this day
boils down to is a personal vendetta...

13:11.042 --> 13:13.670
...against you and Palmer
by the family of Vlctor Drazen?

13:13.778 --> 13:16.872
Yes. Palmer authorized the mission.
I carried it out.

13:16.981 --> 13:20.075
Today is the second anniversary
of Victor Drazen's death.

13:20.184 --> 13:21.446
Happy anniversary.

13:24.055 --> 13:27.252
What is it we're expecting to find
out here in Saugus?

13:27.358 --> 13:28.950
I don't know yet.

13:30.261 --> 13:33.594
I got to tell you, Jack,
it never gets dull with you.

13:34.865 --> 13:36.526
Yeah.

13:38.569 --> 13:41.834
Look, for what it's worth,
I'm sorry about last night.

13:42.373 --> 13:46.173
What, shooting me in the leg with a tranq?
Don't give it a second thought.

13:46.277 --> 13:48.336
Needless to say, I was pretty wound up.

13:48.446 --> 13:52.109
I feel a lot better now though,
knowing my family is safe.

13:57.121 --> 13:58.383
What's the matter?

13:58.556 --> 14:02.253
I'm just beat, you know?
I could use a little sleep.

14:02.860 --> 14:04.452
Tell me about it.

14:21.579 --> 14:22.637
How you doing?

14:23.247 --> 14:24.680
I don't know.

14:26.150 --> 14:29.051
Everything looks familiar,
but I don't understand any of it.

14:29.787 --> 14:32.415
I don't feel anything and I should,
shouldn't I?

14:32.523 --> 14:34.423
No, not yet.

14:36.093 --> 14:41.030
Sometimes music
can help unlock memories.

14:57.615 --> 14:59.310
- Did you ever meet Kim?
- No.

15:00.518 --> 15:02.782
You didn't want her to know
you were seeing anyone.

15:03.254 --> 15:05.848
You said she was taking Jack's side
in the separation...

15:05.956 --> 15:08.891
...and you didn't want her
to be angrier with you.

15:10.127 --> 15:13.528
Why did my husband, Jack...
Why did Jack leave me?

15:13.631 --> 15:15.098
You asked him to.

15:16.000 --> 15:18.935
You told me he was too removed.

15:19.570 --> 15:21.731
There was no connection
between you two anymore.

15:22.773 --> 15:24.172
How about you and I?

15:27.945 --> 15:29.572
I thought there was one.

15:30.347 --> 15:32.042
But what, I didn't?

15:33.417 --> 15:34.941
Truth is, I think you did.

15:35.886 --> 15:37.148
But you were scared.

15:37.388 --> 15:39.015
You didn't want to lose your family.

15:40.257 --> 15:42.725
When Jack asked to move back in,
you let him.

15:48.132 --> 15:50.396
- It's funny.
- What?

15:50.501 --> 15:52.128
I don't remember you at all.

15:53.104 --> 15:54.196
But...

15:54.572 --> 15:59.475
...being with you makes me feel good,
and maybe I don't feel so scared.

16:08.786 --> 16:10.481
Thank you for doing this, Phil.

16:19.296 --> 16:21.096
The truck come through?

16:22.133 --> 16:23.464
I hope not.

16:23.734 --> 16:25.725
No, just park in the back.

16:26.036 --> 16:27.264
Just sit tight.

16:27.371 --> 16:29.305
I can't stay here. I need to find my mom.

16:29.406 --> 16:30.998
I don't know how to get you out.

16:31.108 --> 16:33.941
- I'll make a run for it.
- I wouldn't. Frank's a psycho.

16:34.044 --> 16:35.705
You don't want to cross him.

16:37.882 --> 16:39.372
- I'm going to go.
- No.

16:48.025 --> 16:51.324
Hey! No. Get in the kitchen.

16:53.297 --> 16:54.855
Come on in, man.

16:56.767 --> 16:58.928
You, be careful.

17:00.037 --> 17:02.562
No, he's cool.
Come on. It's all right.

17:06.777 --> 17:08.210
Let's see it.

17:18.888 --> 17:23.053
Yes. That's what I'm talking about.

17:23.160 --> 17:26.323
- Are these the guys with the ecstasy?
- No, they're friends of mine.

17:27.231 --> 17:29.722
- What are you going to do?
- What does it look like?

17:29.833 --> 17:31.733
Can't pay the dealer without money.

17:31.835 --> 17:33.700
- You're going to rip them off?
- Yes.

17:50.254 --> 17:51.551
Thank you.

17:55.125 --> 17:58.652
- Are you all right, honey?
- I'm absolutely fine.

17:58.996 --> 17:59.963
Good.

18:00.097 --> 18:02.258
Go ahead. They're waiting for you.

18:03.567 --> 18:04.625
Okay.

18:04.768 --> 18:06.827
I'm going to head down now.

18:18.182 --> 18:20.013
This is a test for us.

18:21.719 --> 18:23.084
If we love each other...

18:24.288 --> 18:26.051
...support each other...

18:30.494 --> 18:32.462
...nothing else will matter.

18:39.203 --> 18:40.363
Sherry?

18:44.642 --> 18:46.837
I need you now more than ever.

19:09.867 --> 19:12.665
I've always liked this tie on you, David.

19:16.206 --> 19:17.730
Senator?

19:17.841 --> 19:19.138
It's time.

19:54.445 --> 19:55.969
Anything look familiar?

19:56.580 --> 19:59.572
It's weird looking at what I did
for the last couple of months.

19:59.683 --> 20:01.446
It doesn't mean anything to me.

20:02.486 --> 20:03.885
"Yvonne's birthday.

20:04.888 --> 20:07.049
"Kim in Cambria for the weekend.

20:09.193 --> 20:10.558
"Dinner with Phil.

20:11.061 --> 20:12.688
"Ivy at the shore."

20:14.531 --> 20:15.828
Was it nice?

20:16.166 --> 20:18.726
Well, the wait was over an hour, so...

20:20.070 --> 20:23.699
...we decided to walk down the pier
and have some hot dogs.

20:25.376 --> 20:27.674
And you beat me in air hockey.

20:32.082 --> 20:33.640
Air hockey?

20:40.991 --> 20:42.686
What's in there for today?

20:43.460 --> 20:44.654
Nothing.

20:45.729 --> 20:48.994
Yesterday, I had a conference call
with Kitty, whoever that is.

20:49.566 --> 20:52.626
She's a friend of yours.
You work with her sometimes.

20:53.070 --> 20:55.095
You do commercial interior design.

20:55.205 --> 20:57.469
It's just freelance right now...

20:57.574 --> 21:00.566
...but you want to expand
when Kim goes to college.

21:00.944 --> 21:02.707
Why do I sort of remember air hockey...

21:02.813 --> 21:04.974
...but I can't remember what I do
for a living?

21:07.451 --> 21:08.782
Maybe that's Jack.

21:08.886 --> 21:12.583
No, he wouldn't ring the bell.
It's probably my friend Chris, remember?

21:12.689 --> 21:15.317
I told you I wanted someone here,
to be on the safe side.

21:16.059 --> 21:17.117
Yes.

21:17.227 --> 21:19.092
Stay here just in case.

21:31.842 --> 21:33.742
- Teri, this is Chris.
- Hi.

21:35.646 --> 21:38.080
- Why does he have a gun?
- He's here to protect us.

21:38.182 --> 21:40.650
I don't care.
Get that gun out of the house.

21:40.751 --> 21:43.311
Chris, will you just give us
a minute, okay?

21:43.921 --> 21:46.515
- Sure.
- Thanks.

21:51.261 --> 21:53.559
Chris is a friend of mine. I called him.

21:53.664 --> 21:55.131
That doesn't mean anything to me.

21:55.432 --> 21:58.458
I don't know who you are.
I don't know who he is.

21:58.569 --> 22:02.061
- I don't want any guns.
- Okay, I'll tell him to stay outside.

22:02.172 --> 22:03.639
Is that okay?

22:04.408 --> 22:06.672
But we need him here, just in case.

22:07.544 --> 22:10.138
Your husband could have been
the one who roughed you up.

22:11.615 --> 22:13.173
I want you safe.

22:15.786 --> 22:17.378
Teri, look at me.

22:18.822 --> 22:20.153
Look at me.

22:22.659 --> 22:23.717
I'm your friend.

22:24.795 --> 22:26.160
You trust me.

22:26.663 --> 22:28.597
You told me so yourself.

22:28.999 --> 22:31.331
You're going to have
to trust my judgment.

22:33.637 --> 22:34.604
Okay.

22:37.541 --> 22:38.940
What's going on over there?

22:39.042 --> 22:41.533
The wife is here.

22:41.645 --> 22:43.704
- And the daughter?
- No.

22:44.181 --> 22:45.808
What are you waiting for?

22:45.916 --> 22:49.613
There's a little interference,
but it will pass soon.

22:49.720 --> 22:52.245
- Did you find Alexis?
- Not yet.

22:52.956 --> 22:55.982
- Call me when it's done.
- Yes.

23:10.941 --> 23:14.968
Ladies and gentlemen of the
press, please take your seats now.

23:15.245 --> 23:19.147
Senator Palmer is just about here.
We will begin.

23:34.264 --> 23:35.822
Senator Palmer?

23:38.502 --> 23:41.961
Last night, I received a phone call
regarding my son, Keith...

23:42.639 --> 23:44.504
...and my daughter, Nicole.

23:44.841 --> 23:47.867
That call has unfortunately set off
a chain of events...

23:47.978 --> 23:50.344
...that has culminated
in a terrlble tragedy.

23:52.082 --> 23:55.210
Whether or not what I have to say
jeopardizes my campaign...

23:55.319 --> 23:57.082
...Is for the voters to decide.

23:57.387 --> 23:59.548
I'm doing this for my family.

24:01.692 --> 24:06.026
A large portion of the financial
support for my campaign...

24:06.129 --> 24:09.155
...comes from a group of businessmen
rlght here in Los Angeles.

24:10.701 --> 24:13.693
Every presidential campaign relies on
these monetary...

24:13.804 --> 24:15.772
I'll take care of it.

24:16.473 --> 24:17.963
Too late, Carl.

24:20.444 --> 24:23.072
I have apparently misjudged
these local businessmen.

24:23.480 --> 24:26.278
More Importantly,
they have misjudged me.

24:34.925 --> 24:37.860
How it was acquired,
I am not at liberty to say.

24:39.963 --> 24:44.559
I've already handed this incriminating tape
over to the Justice Department.

24:45.535 --> 24:47.935
Whether or not it's admisslble in court...

24:48.905 --> 24:52.534
...It will stlll implicate the men
who have been supporting my campaign.

24:54.645 --> 24:56.340
I'll emphaslze again...

24:56.780 --> 25:01.080
...that these men acted
without my consent or my knowledge.

25:03.620 --> 25:05.485
As for my son, Keith...

25:06.990 --> 25:11.086
...he is prepared to turn himself in
and face whatever consequences...

25:11.194 --> 25:13.162
...a grand jury deems necessary.

25:14.931 --> 25:18.059
He is my son, and I love him...

25:18.669 --> 25:20.159
...and I will stand by him.

25:21.271 --> 25:24.206
I am confident that
when presented with the facts...

25:24.307 --> 25:28.300
...It will be clear that there was
no criminal intent or wrongdoing.

25:28.979 --> 25:31.504
He will only be guilty
of not reporting an accident.

25:34.217 --> 25:36.378
As for my daughter, Nicole...

25:39.056 --> 25:41.251
...It is important
for everyone to remember...

25:41.658 --> 25:44.149
...she was a victim of a horrible crime.

25:44.494 --> 25:46.985
A physical and psychological crime.

25:48.498 --> 25:52.366
She is not a source of information.

25:53.970 --> 25:56.905
This is about a cover-up
of an accidental death.

25:58.508 --> 25:59.998
This is not about rape.

26:01.478 --> 26:06.541
So, I am asking you now as a father,
please find your humanity...

26:06.983 --> 26:10.817
...and spare Nicole the indignity
of having to relive this nightmare.

26:14.991 --> 26:17.221
After that, we lost track of both of them.

26:17.327 --> 26:18.988
How long have you known this?

26:19.096 --> 26:21.724
- Why didn't you tell me? Does Jack know?
- Nina.

26:21.832 --> 26:23.356
Not that I'm aware of.

26:23.467 --> 26:26.459
- Did you know the safe house was hit?
- Relax, okay?

26:26.570 --> 26:28.299
Tony, answer me.

26:28.839 --> 26:31.467
- Yes, I knew.
- Why didn't you tell me?

26:31.975 --> 26:35.308
Mason didn't want you to know
because he didn't want you to tell Jack.

26:35.779 --> 26:38.407
His family is missing.
Shouldn't he know that?

26:38.515 --> 26:40.073
Yes. I'm with you on this.

26:40.317 --> 26:42.547
Mason gave the order, all right?

26:42.652 --> 26:45.678
He's deployed resources.
He's called locals to help find them.

26:45.789 --> 26:48.383
You should have told me.
You work for me.

26:48.658 --> 26:50.387
And you work for Mason.

26:52.529 --> 26:56.226
This is my fault.
I should never have left Teri and Kim.

26:56.333 --> 26:59.268
Nina, you're not a field agent, all right?

26:59.369 --> 27:02.270
- What could you have done?
- Jack needs to know.

27:08.612 --> 27:09.670
Mason.

27:09.780 --> 27:12.408
George, have you told Jack
about his family yet?

27:12.516 --> 27:14.143
No. We're not there yet.

27:14.785 --> 27:17.345
You can't do this. You have to tell him.

27:18.455 --> 27:21.288
Why not let him know so he can help us
find them?

27:21.391 --> 27:24.326
They're exposed.
If Drazen's people find them first...

27:24.427 --> 27:25.724
That's a good idea.

27:25.829 --> 27:27.592
Listen to me, George.

27:27.731 --> 27:30.393
If anything happens,
he's going to hold you responsible.

27:30.500 --> 27:31.865
You better think about that.

27:31.968 --> 27:34.334
I will. Let me know
if you have any progress.

27:34.437 --> 27:35.563
George!

27:36.840 --> 27:38.000
Nina.

27:43.814 --> 27:47.147
Jack, my battery just died.
Can I use your phone for a second?

27:47.250 --> 27:48.581
Yes, sure.

27:50.754 --> 27:51.982
Thanks.

28:00.730 --> 28:02.595
Yes, it's me.

28:02.699 --> 28:05.668
All I want to say is keep the backup units
on standby, all right?

28:05.769 --> 28:09.796
The customer you are trying
to call is unavallable.

28:09.906 --> 28:12.340
- Okay.
- I've got a signal.

28:37.334 --> 28:40.826
- What did Nina have to say?
- She was just checking our location.

28:40.937 --> 28:42.734
What does the GPS say?

28:42.839 --> 28:45.433
It's saying the address is right up ahead.

28:46.509 --> 28:50.070
I know the whole thing was hush-hush,
but who exactly was Victor Drazen?

28:50.180 --> 28:52.512
Victor Drazen was Milosevic's shadow.

28:52.616 --> 28:54.846
He was in charge
of all of his covert operations.

28:54.951 --> 28:58.546
He was responsible for organizing
all the ethnic cleansing campaigns...

28:58.655 --> 29:00.885
...in Kosovo, Sarajevo and Bosnia.

29:02.025 --> 29:04.391
- Your unit took him out?
- That's right.

29:04.527 --> 29:06.927
- You rolled the whole deal up?
- Yes.

29:08.832 --> 29:10.732
Who do you think
would have the influence...

29:10.834 --> 29:13.394
...to be able to run an operation like this?

29:13.570 --> 29:17.233
My guess would be Serbian military
exiles. They could pull this off.

29:17.340 --> 29:20.776
Somehow, Alexis and Andre pulled together
a cell without us knowing.

29:20.877 --> 29:22.276
It's a hell of a cell...

29:22.379 --> 29:24.870
...being able to infiltrate the CTU,
turn Jamey.

29:25.015 --> 29:28.041
Yes, it's hard to believe
that Jamey could move so freely...

29:28.151 --> 29:30.711
...to work against us
without some kind of umbrella.

29:32.489 --> 29:35.720
Any ideas on why the Serbs would want
to spend this much money...

29:35.825 --> 29:38.316
...to turn the power off
in the middle of the woods?

29:39.029 --> 29:40.018
No.

29:42.966 --> 29:46.163
Look, a power transformer.

29:57.948 --> 29:59.711
The lock on it's new.

30:01.584 --> 30:03.984
Why would this be designated
as a wildlife sanctuary?

30:04.087 --> 30:05.679
I mean, think about it.

30:05.789 --> 30:07.950
There's no water. No water, no wetlands.

30:08.058 --> 30:10.526
No wetlands, no birds, no animals.

30:10.627 --> 30:13.187
No nothing as far as I can make out.

30:22.072 --> 30:23.539
Here they are, man.

30:24.274 --> 30:25.832
Let's get ready.

30:34.217 --> 30:36.481
Right on time. I like that.

30:49.499 --> 30:51.067
Who the hell is this?

30:51.167 --> 30:53.658
Just some friends of mine.
Don't worry about it.

30:58.775 --> 31:00.709
How do you know Frankie?

31:01.544 --> 31:03.409
I'm a friend of Rick's.

31:03.513 --> 31:05.071
Who's Rick?

31:07.550 --> 31:08.608
I am.

31:09.285 --> 31:10.775
What happened to you?

31:10.887 --> 31:13.412
Are we going to play "20 questions"
or do some business?

31:13.523 --> 31:16.356
I just want to know who's in the room.
Is that a problem?

31:18.962 --> 31:21.260
No, man. Knock yourself out.

31:21.364 --> 31:23.889
Get a medical history and a urine sample
for all I care.

31:24.000 --> 31:25.865
Let's just get on with it, come on.

31:28.271 --> 31:30.705
Fine, let's do this. You got cash, Frankie?

31:30.807 --> 31:33.867
I got what you need. Don't worry.
Let's see the E first.

31:38.448 --> 31:41.815
Pure MDMA. No caffeine.

31:42.352 --> 31:45.583
- Want to check it?
- No, man, I trust you.

31:48.224 --> 31:49.816
All right, homey.

31:50.627 --> 31:52.322
Where's the money?

31:53.863 --> 31:55.057
Did you hear that?

31:56.366 --> 31:59.460
This guy called me "homey."
I got your money.

32:00.804 --> 32:02.362
It's right here.

32:08.978 --> 32:10.309
Stand down!

32:15.385 --> 32:16.818
Come on, homey.

32:17.287 --> 32:19.152
Stand down, or you're eating one.

32:19.522 --> 32:21.717
Pull that trigger
and you're going down, too.

32:24.661 --> 32:26.151
Just do him!

32:32.902 --> 32:36.770
Everybody chill out, man.

32:36.873 --> 32:39.307
It's all cool. Put the guns down, all right?

32:39.409 --> 32:41.206
Put them down nice and easy.

32:41.311 --> 32:43.074
Going down. Let's go.

32:43.546 --> 32:45.707
See what else they got on them, man.

32:48.118 --> 32:50.780
All this because you couldn't keep
my brother alive?

33:09.072 --> 33:11.540
They might not have registered
with their real names.

33:12.475 --> 33:15.137
No. Just use the description
that we sent you, okay?

33:15.245 --> 33:16.837
We'll do our best.

33:18.181 --> 33:20.911
- You checking the hospitals?
- Yes.

33:21.518 --> 33:24.316
I don't understand
how Teri and Kim just disappeared.

33:24.921 --> 33:26.286
It might be a good thing, you know?

33:26.389 --> 33:29.825
If Drazen's people had them,
we would have heard about it by now.

33:30.326 --> 33:32.851
After all, Jack and Palmer
are the primary targets.

33:32.962 --> 33:34.452
What about Jack's house?

33:34.564 --> 33:36.725
I sent Williams over,
but I'll call and check.

33:36.833 --> 33:39.233
- And Kim's phone call?
- We traced it to a phone booth.

33:39.335 --> 33:40.962
We're checking the whole area.

33:41.070 --> 33:44.164
Nina, we're doing everything we can,
all right?

33:44.274 --> 33:45.468
Are you?

34:13.969 --> 34:17.235
What are you going to do now, man?
You're going to kill us?

34:25.215 --> 34:26.273
Yes.

34:31.420 --> 34:32.978
I'll kill you...

34:34.023 --> 34:35.956
...if I ever see you again.

34:39.462 --> 34:41.157
You should get that stitched.

34:43.266 --> 34:44.699
How's that for a nose job?

34:44.801 --> 34:46.928
It's pretty good. Yes, I like that.

34:49.472 --> 34:50.871
Frankie?

34:50.974 --> 34:52.235
What's that, homey?

34:56.145 --> 34:57.373
Speak up.

34:59.449 --> 35:01.576
You have the right to remain silent.

35:06.422 --> 35:07.548
Put them down!

35:10.860 --> 35:12.794
Put them down!

35:12.895 --> 35:15.056
Right now! Drop the gun now!

35:19.802 --> 35:20.996
Arrest all of them.

35:21.104 --> 35:23.231
Please, don't do this.
We didn't do anything.

35:23.740 --> 35:24.934
We're not a part of this.

35:25.041 --> 35:26.941
- Arms up.
- Up against the wall.

35:29.379 --> 35:31.210
Let me have your handy.

35:34.951 --> 35:37.886
This is Krugman. We got a code four.

35:37.987 --> 35:40.512
One suspect down. Five being booked.

35:42.892 --> 35:44.792
I think I got a broken nose.

35:48.798 --> 35:50.527
Look, I'll say it again.

35:50.833 --> 35:54.234
I bear full responsibility
for not knowing about it.

35:56.139 --> 36:00.041
A senator's duty, a president's duty...

36:00.610 --> 36:04.307
...an elected representative's duty
is not only to his country...

36:04.914 --> 36:06.575
...but also to his family.

36:08.651 --> 36:11.984
If he cannot manage the interactions of
the people close to him...

36:13.723 --> 36:17.989
...then he can't expect the electorate
to believe in his ability to lead a nation.

36:19.696 --> 36:21.561
I don't deny I made a mistake.

36:22.532 --> 36:23.999
A serious one.

36:25.268 --> 36:27.259
I only ask you to consider...

36:27.437 --> 36:31.305
...that I am not the flrst person
in public office to make one.

36:32.742 --> 36:34.039
Thank you.

36:37.613 --> 36:38.773
Senator Palmer?

36:38.881 --> 36:40.109
Senator?

36:57.633 --> 36:59.191
I love you, Dad.

37:00.770 --> 37:02.328
I love you, son.

37:26.462 --> 37:28.054
This is Emily. She's 11.

37:28.164 --> 37:31.497
And this is Jennifer. She just turned 9.

37:32.368 --> 37:34.802
- I didn't meet them?
- No.

37:34.937 --> 37:38.896
We decided to leave everyone else out of it
until you were sure what you wanted.

37:41.144 --> 37:42.509
I'll get it.

38:08.070 --> 38:09.833
She made this for me.

38:11.040 --> 38:13.235
You want milk or sugar in it?

38:14.110 --> 38:15.168
Yes.

38:17.413 --> 38:19.643
Phil, I think I'm remembering something.

38:19.749 --> 38:21.649
Really? I'll be right there.

38:26.189 --> 38:28.749
- Restroom?
- Right down the hall.

38:35.064 --> 38:36.361
Oh, my God.

38:48.010 --> 38:49.602
Where's the girl?

38:52.348 --> 38:54.612
Your daughter, where is she?

38:56.519 --> 38:58.146
I don't know.

38:58.621 --> 38:59.815
Tell me where she is...

38:59.922 --> 39:03.358
...and I'll make this painless
for both of you, I promise.

39:03.459 --> 39:05.893
I don't know.

39:07.296 --> 39:08.695
Fine.

39:13.503 --> 39:14.697
Oh, my God.

39:14.804 --> 39:18.570
Teri? Step away. Move away, Teri.

39:19.041 --> 39:20.372
Oh, my God.

39:20.676 --> 39:22.610
Teri, step away, please.

39:24.780 --> 39:28.614
The car. Oh, my God. The car.

39:29.085 --> 39:30.780
I lost Kimmy. No...

39:31.454 --> 39:33.388
Teri? Teri, it's okay. You're safe.

39:33.489 --> 39:36.322
I lost my baby, Kim.

39:36.659 --> 39:37.717
Teri?

39:38.661 --> 39:39.992
Oh, my God.

40:01.317 --> 40:03.046
GPS says this is it.

40:03.986 --> 40:05.351
Right.

40:14.397 --> 40:16.058
What is that, reconnaissance?

40:17.967 --> 40:19.935
Someone knows we're here.
