00:01.835 --> 00:02.402
This is the Evergreen

00:02.402 --> 00:02.802
This is the
Evergreen forest.

00:03.770 --> 00:06.006
Quiet, peaceful, serene.

00:07.974 --> 00:10.343
That is, until
Bert Raccoon wakes up.

00:10.343 --> 00:12.112
Bert Raccoon: Yahoooo!

00:13.613 --> 00:15.515
Yeeeehaaaa!

00:16.549 --> 00:17.584
Yikes!

00:18.018 --> 00:19.519
Yaaaah...

00:22.455 --> 00:23.857
Yeaaaah!

00:23.857 --> 00:26.760
Luckily, he has some
good friends to help him out.

00:34.300 --> 00:36.436
Life would be simple
in the forest except for...

00:37.637 --> 00:39.506
Cyril Sneer!

00:43.276 --> 00:45.311
And his life would be simple
except for...

00:46.346 --> 00:47.514
the Raccoons!!

00:47.514 --> 00:49.482
♪ (show theme music) ♪

01:02.362 --> 01:04.798
Blue skies,
unlimited horizons.

01:04.798 --> 01:07.500
Perfect weather for the
Evergreen air show.

01:08.268 --> 01:11.404
And Bert, Ralph and Melissa
are there to enjoy it all.

01:12.105 --> 01:14.808
Well, at least Bert and
Melissa are enjoying it.

01:14.808 --> 01:17.944
Boy, those were
the days, right guys?

01:17.944 --> 01:19.546
The dawn of the flying era,

01:19.546 --> 01:21.347
when the sky was the limit,

01:21.347 --> 01:23.416
and planes had two wings.

01:23.416 --> 01:25.151
They still
have two wings Bert...

01:25.151 --> 01:26.886
One on either side.

01:26.886 --> 01:30.256
Oh Ralph, where's
your sense of romance?

01:30.256 --> 01:33.193
How often do you get to
see old planes like these?

01:33.193 --> 01:35.361
Watch out! Clear the way!

01:35.361 --> 01:36.996
Plane coming through.

01:38.231 --> 01:40.200
Pig 1: Wing flaps?
Pig 2: Check.

01:40.200 --> 01:42.202
Pig 1: Parachutes?
Pig 2: Check.

01:42.202 --> 01:44.304
Pig 1: Rubber dinghy?
Pig 2: Check.

01:44.304 --> 01:46.606
My, you
three look dashing.

01:46.606 --> 01:50.110
Pig 1: I hope we look as
dashing, when we're crashing.

01:50.110 --> 01:52.612
Quit whining,
you paranoid porkers.

01:52.612 --> 01:56.049
There's $50 thousand bucks
in prize money up for grabs

01:56.049 --> 01:57.350
in that pylon race.

01:57.350 --> 01:59.752
And you're going to win it!

01:59.752 --> 02:01.254
Pig 3: Or die trying.

02:01.254 --> 02:04.290
I think I'll dress
up as a daring air ace

02:04.290 --> 02:06.126
for the costume dance tonight.

02:06.126 --> 02:07.794
How about you, Ralph?

02:07.794 --> 02:09.429
I'm not going.

02:09.429 --> 02:11.431
You know the food
writer is on vacation?

02:11.431 --> 02:13.066
I've got to finish that column.

02:13.066 --> 02:16.136
Ralph Raccoon.
You promised you'd go!

02:16.136 --> 02:18.605
We haven't been
out dancing in ages.

02:18.605 --> 02:19.939
Contact.

02:21.774 --> 02:23.276
Great, it runs!

02:23.276 --> 02:26.446
Now take off and hit
the wild blue yonder!

02:26.446 --> 02:27.514
Ha-haaa!

02:30.583 --> 02:33.620
Wow! That is some pilot!

02:37.557 --> 02:40.994
I think the competition
just got a little stiffer, Pop.

02:40.994 --> 02:42.896
Ho-hoooo!

02:42.896 --> 02:45.331
Oh, what's he
going to do now?

02:45.999 --> 02:48.468
Oh-uh! Oh..uaaaaah!
Look out!

02:48.468 --> 02:50.236
Yaaahh.

02:51.804 --> 02:53.473
Who is that maniac?

02:54.607 --> 02:57.644
Wow, that guy's an ace?

02:57.644 --> 02:59.412
That guys' a hazard.

02:59.412 --> 03:01.814
That guy's Troy Malone.

03:01.814 --> 03:03.516
You know him?

03:03.516 --> 03:06.319
Melissa, it's
great to see you again!

03:06.319 --> 03:08.588
Troy Malone.

03:09.789 --> 03:12.825
Yeah. I guess,
you do know him.

03:16.129 --> 03:19.832
I can't wait to see
that pylon race tomorrow.

03:19.832 --> 03:22.535
Don't you wish you could fly
like Troy Malone, Ralph?

03:22.535 --> 03:24.504
Soaring like an eagle,

03:24.504 --> 03:26.906
diving like a falcon...

03:26.906 --> 03:29.342
...and landing
like a ton of bricks.

03:29.342 --> 03:30.944
No thanks, Bert.

03:30.944 --> 03:34.147
I'm perfectly happy with
both feet on the ground.

03:34.147 --> 03:37.817
So.. this is the
nerve center of the famous

03:37.817 --> 03:39.886
Evergreen Standard.

03:39.886 --> 03:44.224
Melissa makes it sound pretty
exciting, Ralph old buddy.

03:45.858 --> 03:48.628
It..ah..has it's moments.

03:48.628 --> 03:52.198
You guys have got to
hear some of Troy's stories.

03:52.198 --> 03:54.601
He's been all over the
world, flying missions.

03:54.601 --> 03:56.669
And he speaks nine languages.

03:56.669 --> 03:59.973
Ten, really.
But I don't like to brag.

03:59.973 --> 04:01.841
Yeah. I can see that.

04:01.841 --> 04:03.876
What sort of missions?

04:03.876 --> 04:05.745
Oh, search and rescue,

04:05.745 --> 04:08.648
medical evacuations,
that sort of thing.

04:09.882 --> 04:12.085
Is this your latest
story, Ralphie?

04:12.485 --> 04:16.189
A hundred and one ways
to cook with turnips?

04:16.189 --> 04:17.790
Um.. very interesting.

04:17.790 --> 04:19.993
What?! Um.. no!

04:19.993 --> 04:22.528
That's the.. um,
food column.

04:22.528 --> 04:25.431
I'm filling in for the...
regular writer.

04:25.431 --> 04:26.599
And next week?

04:26.599 --> 04:30.870
One hundred and one ways
to cure indigestion.

04:30.870 --> 04:32.772
Riveting stuff, eh?

04:32.772 --> 04:35.108
Intriguing!
Be fair now, Bert.

04:35.108 --> 04:38.845
Last week Ralph broke a big
story on the acid rain cover up.

04:38.845 --> 04:42.582
(laughs) Oh yeah,
I'm just kidding!

04:42.582 --> 04:45.385
Hey Troy, have you got
a place to stay yet?

04:45.385 --> 04:47.954
Well, I was going
to sleep in my plane,

04:47.954 --> 04:50.623
but if you've got
a better offer?

04:50.623 --> 04:54.360
Sure. You'll stay
with us. Right gang?

04:54.360 --> 04:55.595
Of course.

04:55.595 --> 04:58.264
Unless you'd prefer
to sleep in your plane.

04:58.264 --> 05:00.466
It's settled.
Come on, Troy.

05:00.466 --> 05:02.568
We'll fetch your gear,
and get you moved in.

05:02.568 --> 05:05.405
I'll be along,
when I get the press fixed.

05:08.808 --> 05:10.677
Now, why didn't I think of that?

05:12.111 --> 05:13.913
Of all the rotten luck!

05:15.315 --> 05:17.450
Until that hotshot
Troy Malone turned up,

05:17.450 --> 05:19.752
I had this air race in the bag!

05:20.420 --> 05:21.954
We were the only entry.

05:21.954 --> 05:25.725
Pig 2: Face it boss, we don't
have a chance against him.

05:25.725 --> 05:27.327
He's a natural.

05:27.327 --> 05:29.062
And you're unnatural.

05:29.062 --> 05:30.763
But when I'm through with you,

05:30.763 --> 05:33.266
people will believe
pigs can fly.

05:33.266 --> 05:36.235
We'll start with a little
G-force training.

05:36.235 --> 05:39.439
I don't want you passing
out on tight turns.

05:39.439 --> 05:41.574
Oooooh.

05:41.574 --> 05:43.810
Enjoy!
Ah-ah-ah-ahhh!

05:43.810 --> 05:45.311
I'll be back
in an hour.

05:45.311 --> 05:48.715
Ah-ah-ah-ahhh!

05:48.715 --> 05:53.219
...so there I was,
shushing down the expert slope,

05:53.219 --> 05:57.457
with 4,000 tonnes of raging
avalanche roaring behind me.

05:57.957 --> 06:01.461
That's when I first saw... Melissa.

06:01.461 --> 06:03.196
With seconds to spare,

06:03.196 --> 06:06.165
I swept her up in my arms
and outran the avalanche.

06:06.165 --> 06:09.702
It was a bit tricky
on one ski, I suppose...

06:09.702 --> 06:13.172
I'm sure it was
no problem for you, Troy.

06:13.172 --> 06:16.142
Oh, it wasn't
that big an avalanche.

06:16.142 --> 06:18.711
Ralph, tell Troy how we met.

06:18.711 --> 06:21.080
It was so cute.

06:21.080 --> 06:24.650
Oh, I'm sure Troy doesn't
want to hear that, Melissa.

06:24.650 --> 06:27.553
Sure I do.
C'mon, Ralph. Tell us.

06:27.553 --> 06:31.424
I spilled a
cup of coffee on her.

06:31.424 --> 06:34.160
I believe it was mocha java.

06:34.160 --> 06:37.029
That's our Ralphie boy.

06:37.029 --> 06:39.198
One of the great romantics.

06:39.198 --> 06:41.300
You and Bert
better get going, Melissa.

06:41.300 --> 06:42.869
You don't want to be
late for the dance.

06:42.869 --> 06:45.438
Are you positive you
don't want to come, Ralph?

06:45.438 --> 06:47.874
Oh, I'd better
finish up that work.

06:47.874 --> 06:50.209
You sure?
In that case...

06:50.209 --> 06:54.747
how about I escort you, Melissa?

06:54.747 --> 06:57.216
Well thanks, Troy.
That sounds like fun.

06:57.216 --> 06:59.419
You're gonna
need a costume, Troy.

06:59.419 --> 07:03.156
Why don't I just
go as a... dashing aviator.

07:03.156 --> 07:04.924
I think you could
pull that off, Troy.

07:04.924 --> 07:09.362
And why don't I just go
as a dashing food columnist.

07:10.062 --> 07:13.166
Ahhhh! Oouuh!

07:13.166 --> 07:14.567
Oh phoeey!

07:18.438 --> 07:20.973
Pig 1: Boy, listen to all
those people out here

07:20.973 --> 07:24.010
having fun at the
fancy dress ball.

07:24.010 --> 07:28.080
Pig 3: Now I know how
Cinderella felt! Uh!

07:28.080 --> 07:30.583
Pig 2: Maybe we can
sneak out and mingle.

07:30.583 --> 07:32.418
Oops.

07:32.418 --> 07:33.986
Pig 1: Dressed as what?

07:33.986 --> 07:35.421
Greased pigs?!

07:40.560 --> 07:42.094
Hi guys! Having fun?

07:42.094 --> 07:44.931
He-he! This is great!

07:44.931 --> 07:48.000
Hey Cedric, you look terrific!

07:49.035 --> 07:51.771
This reminds me
of the old days, Melissa.

07:52.772 --> 07:55.808
Boy, Ralph sure is
lucky he married you.

07:55.808 --> 07:58.244
He really
is a sweetheart.

07:58.244 --> 08:00.613
I just wish he were here.

08:00.613 --> 08:03.616
Sometimes, I think
he works much too hard.

08:04.917 --> 08:07.153
Ralph, is that you?

08:07.153 --> 08:09.489
I thought, you were
going to work all night.

08:09.489 --> 08:12.825
(laughs) Bert!

08:12.825 --> 08:15.761
Cedric! Hi!

08:15.761 --> 08:18.831
I..er.. decided
to knock off early,

08:18.831 --> 08:20.900
and, you know, check things out.

08:21.901 --> 08:24.570
Pig 1: Okay, get ready
for the engine test.

08:24.570 --> 08:27.006
And let's hope
it doesn't work.

08:27.006 --> 08:28.441
Contact!

08:31.444 --> 08:33.513
Whooahh. Shut it down!

08:33.513 --> 08:34.947
Shut it down!!

08:34.947 --> 08:37.483
Pig 2:
Aaaaahhh!

08:37.483 --> 08:41.153
Pig 1: Runaway plane!
Runaway plane!

08:41.153 --> 08:42.522
Whoops!

08:42.522 --> 08:44.290
Watch out! Ahhh!

08:44.290 --> 08:45.625
Melissa!

08:46.959 --> 08:48.594
Get down, Melissa.

08:49.996 --> 08:51.130

Gotcha.

Yeah..what a guy.

Keep your nose up!

trying to tell you, boss.

09:42.848 --> 09:45.718
The big race
is this afternoon,

09:45.718 --> 09:48.421
and you hopeless
ham hocks are entered.

09:48.421 --> 09:51.023
And if you don't want to
end up in a deli counter,

09:51.023 --> 09:53.326
you'll win! Got it?!

09:53.326 --> 09:55.361
Yes, Sir! Yes Sir.

Pig 2: Let's face it.

10:01.500 --> 10:04.036
If we can't weasel
our way of this mess,

10:04.036 --> 10:06.205
we'll end up in intensive care.

10:06.205 --> 10:09.575
Pig 1: Intensive care!
That's it!

10:09.575 --> 10:11.711
Pig 3: Ooh, Lloyd's got an idea.

10:11.711 --> 10:14.547
And I'll bet, it's brilliant.

10:16.716 --> 10:18.417
Can you change
that line to read...

10:18.417 --> 10:22.588
'Daring pilot stops
runaway plane!'

10:22.588 --> 10:24.790
Do you mind, Troy?

10:24.790 --> 10:27.560
I can't work with someone
looking over my shoulder.

10:27.560 --> 10:29.962
I just want to make sure
you spell my name right,

10:29.962 --> 10:32.665
Ralphie, old buddy.

10:32.665 --> 10:34.066
I may not
be much at stopping

10:34.066 --> 10:38.371
runaway airplanes,
Troy, but I can spell.

10:38.371 --> 10:41.540
And he's a
heck of a typist too.

10:41.540 --> 10:44.076
Well, I guess old
Ralphie boy's got things

10:44.076 --> 10:45.811
pretty well in hand here.

10:45.811 --> 10:48.748
Does anybody want to
zip down to the airfield,

10:48.748 --> 10:51.484
and take a spin in my plane?

10:51.484 --> 10:55.821
Wow!!
I thought, you'd never ask!

10:55.821 --> 10:58.157
Let's go Melissa!

10:58.157 --> 10:59.592
How about you, Ralph?

10:59.592 --> 11:01.827
Are you coming? It'll be fun.

11:01.827 --> 11:03.396
Yeah, Ralph, old pal.

11:03.396 --> 11:05.765
I'll even let you fly my plane.

11:06.332 --> 11:10.336
It'll be a nice change from
piloting a desk all day.

11:10.336 --> 11:13.105
Sure. Sure,
I'll come down later.

11:13.506 --> 11:17.076
And I'll bring the story
down for your approval.

11:17.076 --> 11:18.177
C'mon, Bert.

11:18.177 --> 11:19.979
Be right with you, Troy.

11:19.979 --> 11:23.115
Um.. Are you okay, Ralph?

11:23.115 --> 11:26.452
I mean, you've been acting
a little.. funny lately.

11:28.621 --> 11:31.223
Oh... I'm fine.

11:31.223 --> 11:35.461
Well..good.
But if.. you know...

11:35.461 --> 11:38.164
if there's anything
you want to talk about...

11:38.164 --> 11:40.232
just let me know, okay?

11:40.232 --> 11:43.102
I will. Thanks, Bert.

11:43.102 --> 11:44.970
Ok, Ralph!

11:44.970 --> 11:46.672
I'll see you later.

11:47.473 --> 11:51.210
Face it, Ralph,
some guys make the news,

11:51.210 --> 11:54.447
and some guys
just write it down.

Well? Come on in.

12:56.776 --> 12:58.544
What happened to your three?

12:58.544 --> 13:02.348
Pig 1: It's a sad
and painful story.

13:02.348 --> 13:06.185
Pig 2: Oh yeah, we didn't
even see the cement truck!

13:06.185 --> 13:07.753
Not at all.

13:07.753 --> 13:10.422
Pig 3: And what do you
think the chances are

13:10.422 --> 13:13.859
of being hit by a meteorite?

13:13.859 --> 13:16.529
Zero. What
can I do for you?

13:16.529 --> 13:19.598
Pig 1: We want to place
an ad... for a pilot.

13:19.598 --> 13:20.800
A pilot?

13:20.800 --> 13:23.602
The race will be over before
the Standard comes out.

13:23.602 --> 13:25.371
Pig 2: Well, that's
not our problem.

13:25.371 --> 13:28.040
But the boss can't
say we didn't' try.

13:33.045 --> 13:34.547
Look at that idiot.

13:34.547 --> 13:36.582
It's a wonder he
doesn't kill himself.

13:37.650 --> 13:39.151
Did Melissa enjoy her flight?

13:39.151 --> 13:40.553
I dunno, Ralph.

13:41.720 --> 13:43.389
Ask her when she comes down.

13:44.123 --> 13:45.157
Melissa?

13:48.794 --> 13:50.763
Melissaaaaaa!!

13:52.164 --> 13:56.135
Oh Ralph!
You've just got to try this!

13:56.135 --> 13:59.138
That does it, Troy!
Who do you think you are?

13:59.138 --> 14:02.641
You-you conceited,
overbearing show off?

14:02.641 --> 14:05.511
Risk your own life,
not Melissa's!

14:05.511 --> 14:08.080
Hey, lighten up, old buddy.

14:08.080 --> 14:10.149
And I'm not your buddy!

14:13.986 --> 14:15.855
A cement truck?

14:15.855 --> 14:18.791
Pig 1: And a garbage truck. Ooh!

14:18.791 --> 14:20.192
A garbage truck?!

14:20.192 --> 14:22.461
Hah! How appropriate.

14:22.461 --> 14:24.930
We've still got
an hour before the race.

14:24.930 --> 14:26.932
You can recover by then.

14:26.932 --> 14:29.702
Pig 2: Impossible!!
I mean, I mean.. uh...

14:29.702 --> 14:31.837
I don't think so.

14:31.837 --> 14:35.541
But we did advertise
for another pilot.

14:35.541 --> 14:36.542
Big deal.

14:36.542 --> 14:38.510
Who'd be crazy enough to go up

14:38.510 --> 14:40.179
in that flying death trap?

14:44.049 --> 14:46.886
Mr. Sneer, I understand
you're looking for someone

14:46.886 --> 14:49.488
to fly your plane
in the pylon race.

14:49.488 --> 14:51.323
Yeah, so?

14:51.323 --> 14:53.792
Well, I'm you're man.

14:59.498 --> 15:04.803
Oh, the pain! Agony! Ooh!

15:04.803 --> 15:06.639
Alright, Raccoon.

15:06.639 --> 15:08.440
Here's the game plan.

15:08.440 --> 15:11.744
I want you to get out there
and win. Got it?

15:11.744 --> 15:14.580
It sounds pretty
straight forward, Mr. Sneer.

15:14.580 --> 15:17.449
Gee Ralph, are you
sure you're up to this?

15:17.449 --> 15:20.552
You haven't logged all
that many flying hours.

15:20.552 --> 15:21.654
Maybe not, Cedric.

15:21.654 --> 15:24.256
But I've had it up to
here with Troy Malone.

15:24.256 --> 15:27.559
I'm going to give him
a run for his money.

15:27.559 --> 15:30.930
It's not his
money. It's my money!

15:30.930 --> 15:33.766
Now get out there and
bring back that fifty grand!!

15:33.766 --> 15:36.769
And don't wreck my plane!

15:36.769 --> 15:37.770
Contact!

15:42.341 --> 15:45.577
Hey Troy,
we're rootin' for ya'!

15:45.577 --> 15:47.446
Go, Troy, go!

15:48.013 --> 15:50.015
Hi, Cedric.
I thought the Pigs

15:50.015 --> 15:52.685
were flying Cyril's plane.
Who's that?

15:52.685 --> 15:55.187
You mean,
he didn't tell you?

15:55.187 --> 15:56.155
It's Ralph!!

15:56.155 --> 15:59.291
Melissa, its, it's, it's.. ooh!

15:59.291 --> 16:00.926
Hey, Ralph, I don't know
hat you think you're doing,

16:00.926 --> 16:03.429
but you're way out
of your league.

16:03.429 --> 16:06.131
We'll see.. buddy!

16:08.133 --> 16:12.838
Ralph!...
Ralph!... No!!

16:12.838 --> 16:16.375
Don't do this, Ralph!

16:20.245 --> 16:22.648
I can't believe
that's our Ralphie up there!

16:22.648 --> 16:24.817
What's he trying to prove?

16:24.817 --> 16:26.318
I think
he's trying to prove

16:26.318 --> 16:28.253
he's better than Troy Malone.

16:28.954 --> 16:30.789
Uh-oh.

16:38.130 --> 16:41.400
Hey Ralphie, you
should stick to typing.

16:41.400 --> 16:44.003
Aahh!

16:44.003 --> 16:45.304
Oh, Ralph!

16:55.781 --> 16:58.183
How's my
ace pilot doing?

16:58.183 --> 17:00.352
Well, he's
still in the air, Pop.

17:00.352 --> 17:03.322
Go Ralph go! Go Ralph go!

17:03.322 --> 17:05.491
Bert/Cedric: Go Ralph go!

17:05.491 --> 17:08.360
Bert/Cedric/Cyril: Go Ralph go!

17:11.630 --> 17:14.533
Hey, Ralphie,
save yourself the grief!

17:15.167 --> 17:17.202
Land now!

17:17.202 --> 17:18.537
Look out!

17:19.838 --> 17:21.607
Troy's in trouble!

17:21.607 --> 17:23.308
Good. Go Ralph!

17:23.308 --> 17:26.378
You've got this race wrapped up.
Ha-haaa!

17:27.279 --> 17:29.114
Oh, no! No!

17:29.114 --> 17:31.450
No, you ring-tailed reject!

17:31.450 --> 17:33.152
Not that way!

17:33.152 --> 17:36.088
What in the name of
wingtips is he doing?

17:36.088 --> 17:37.623
He's going after Troy.

17:37.623 --> 17:39.691
That's our Ralphie!

17:41.126 --> 17:44.463
Troy. Can you make
it in for a landing?

17:44.463 --> 17:46.331
Are you kidding, rookie?

17:46.331 --> 17:50.135
I could bring this baby
in if the wings fell off.

17:50.135 --> 17:53.005
Now give me some room!

17:55.507 --> 17:57.643
Uaaahh!!

17:57.643 --> 18:00.479
Ahh! Whooah! Yeoww!

18:00.479 --> 18:02.014
I can't see!

18:02.014 --> 18:04.883
Whoa-hoho!

18:09.021 --> 18:10.823
Well, here
comes the last pylon!

18:12.057 --> 18:13.525
The winner!!

18:13.525 --> 18:15.661
Ahh-oooh!

18:17.262 --> 18:19.498
Phew, that was close.

18:19.498 --> 18:22.000
Now, if I can get
these goggles off.

18:23.001 --> 18:25.104
Bert/Cedric: C'mon Ralph!

18:29.074 --> 18:31.777
Ohh! Uaaaahh!

18:31.777 --> 18:33.946
Oh boy.

18:35.280 --> 18:36.849
What's going on?

18:36.849 --> 18:38.617
He'd better not crash.

18:38.617 --> 18:40.285
That's my plane!

18:41.820 --> 18:45.090
Whooo..aaa...

18:45.958 --> 18:47.292
Whoaaaaa!

18:49.228 --> 18:50.295
Whoaaa!

18:50.295 --> 18:53.499
Whoa! Whoaaa!

18:53.499 --> 18:57.769
Oh-ho-ho-hoooo!

18:57.769 --> 18:58.971
Ralph!!!
Hurry, Cedric!

18:59.972 --> 19:01.607
Ta-daaaah!

19:01.607 --> 19:03.809
Ralph, are you okay?

19:03.809 --> 19:05.744
Hey. I'm the winner!

19:05.744 --> 19:06.979
Aren't I?

19:08.213 --> 19:10.449
Ralph,
are you all right?

19:10.449 --> 19:12.584
I'm fine.
I can't believe it.

19:12.584 --> 19:14.286
You were terrific!

19:14.286 --> 19:17.089
That's the best
crash I ever saw.

19:17.089 --> 19:20.759
Uh..thanks Bert. I think.

19:20.759 --> 19:23.595
Of all the bone-headed,
dim-witted, crazy stunts

19:23.595 --> 19:25.931
you've ever pulled,
this takes the cake!

19:25.931 --> 19:27.065
But I was
just trying to...

19:27.065 --> 19:29.334
I know exactly,
what you were trying to do.

19:29.334 --> 19:31.436
But you didn't have to.
Yeah, but Troy...

19:31.436 --> 19:34.339
Forget about Troy.
I love you!

19:34.339 --> 19:36.975
You big... you big...

19:36.975 --> 19:38.577
Oh, come here!

19:41.914 --> 19:43.182
Uh-oh.

19:43.182 --> 19:44.816
Look at the mess
you've made out of my

19:44.816 --> 19:47.653
valuable aircraft,
you fur ball flake!

19:47.653 --> 19:49.688
But, never mind.

19:49.688 --> 19:51.557
You and I can make a fortune!

19:51.557 --> 19:53.258
We'll tour the country.

19:53.258 --> 19:56.361
You crash the planes
and I'll rake in the loot.

19:56.361 --> 19:59.464
We'll call it,
Sneer's Flying Circus.

19:59.464 --> 20:00.532
What do you say?

20:00.532 --> 20:03.502
Pig 1: If anyone's making
a fortune, it's us.

20:03.502 --> 20:06.705
We're your loyal
personal pilots, boss!!

20:06.705 --> 20:08.707
Pig 2: 50/50, right boss?

20:08.707 --> 20:12.010
The Flying Porkers.
How's that sound?

20:14.012 --> 20:18.217
Isn't it amazing,
how quickly pigs mend?

20:19.451 --> 20:22.120
Pig 1: Why, why it's a miracle!

20:22.120 --> 20:25.057
Pig 3: Of modern medicine, Sir.

20:25.057 --> 20:29.127
Con me, will you?
You treacherous tenderloins!

20:29.127 --> 20:33.365
Come back here and meet
your doom like pigs.

20:33.365 --> 20:35.234
Hey, Melissa!

20:35.234 --> 20:39.238
Doesn't the big winner
get a victory kiss?

20:39.238 --> 20:41.240
He sure does, Troy.

20:44.543 --> 20:46.211
Sometimes it seems
that nothing

20:46.211 --> 20:48.347
we do turns out right.

20:48.347 --> 20:49.848
And no matter how we try,

20:49.848 --> 20:52.517
someone else always
does it better.

20:52.517 --> 20:55.087
Certainly Ralph Raccoon
know the feeling.

20:55.087 --> 20:56.722
But as Ralph learned,

20:56.722 --> 20:59.091
there's one thing you can do

20:59.091 --> 21:00.692
better than anyone else,

21:00.692 --> 21:03.428
and that's be yourself.

21:08.400 --> 21:11.169
Here's
looking at you, kid.

21:13.238 --> 21:14.239
Ahem...

21:14.239 --> 21:16.441
Troy. Pull up
a chair and join us!

21:16.441 --> 21:18.043
Yes.
Oh no. I...

21:18.043 --> 21:20.579
I just came to say goodbye.

21:20.579 --> 21:23.382
Besides.. three's a crowd.

21:23.382 --> 21:26.918
No hard feelings
about the race, eh Ralph?

21:27.719 --> 21:29.121
Of course not.

21:30.956 --> 21:32.924
Well, wherever you're off to,

21:32.924 --> 21:34.860
we wish you the
best of luck, Troy.

21:34.860 --> 21:36.628
Thanks, Ralph, Melissa.

21:37.329 --> 21:39.264
Psst. Uhm.. Schaeffer?

21:39.264 --> 21:40.899
Ralph and Melissa's dinner...

21:41.633 --> 21:43.468
Well...

21:43.468 --> 21:44.603
