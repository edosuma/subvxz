    Let's just concentrate on   
    the, uh, left side, okay?   

00:08.691 --> 00:09.658
                 Yeah.          

00:09.692 --> 00:10.959
                  We have a boy.

00:10.993 --> 00:13.561
             No, no, wait, wait.
             It's a girl.       

00:13.595 --> 00:17.565
            It's a boy again.   
            This is weird.      

00:17.599 --> 00:19.450
 All right, maybe it's a girl.

out what Carla is, huh?

No, Cliff, we're trying to find 
  out what sex my babies are.   

00:28.911 --> 00:31.813
See, if the ring goes back      
     and forth, it's a boy.     

00:31.847 --> 00:34.416
    If it goes around           
in a circle, it's a girl.       

00:34.450 --> 00:39.053
 And if it just dangles there   
 doing nothing, it's a Clavin.  

00:39.088 --> 00:40.988
I can tell you                  
something                       

00:41.023 --> 00:44.426
we used to, uh,                 
do on the farm.                 

00:44.460 --> 00:46.294
            We'd take a fresh   
            laid chicken egg    

00:46.329 --> 00:47.962
         and we'd put on a spoon

00:47.996 --> 00:50.031
            and hold it over    
            the woman's stomach.

00:50.065 --> 00:52.567
If it dipped down,              
it was female, if not,          

00:52.602 --> 00:54.269
             male.              

00:54.303 --> 00:57.272
  So how often did you predict  
     the sex of the babies?     

00:57.306 --> 00:59.907
Never. This was to predict      
    the sex of the chicken.     

00:59.942 --> 01:03.612
All right,                      
you take a spoon, right?

             insurance salesmen.

06:34.259 --> 06:35.343
         Boy, oh, boy.          

06:35.377 --> 06:37.395
      Don't you just love       
  this Yorkshire pudding, Ma?   

06:37.429 --> 06:39.997
    That's a <i>real</i> delicacy.     

06:40.032 --> 06:42.166
  The English didn't think so.  

06:42.201 --> 06:45.519
  Actually, Yorkshire pudding   
 was invented in the late 1770s 

06:45.553 --> 06:47.038
    during a beef shortage.     

06:48.223 --> 06:51.024
    A person could be given     
      a little bit of beef      

06:51.059 --> 06:53.527
     and soak up the gravy      
    with the pudding,           

06:53.562 --> 06:56.264
  thereby fooling his stomach   
         into thinking          

06:56.298 --> 06:59.567
 he was having a fuller dinner  
     than he actually was.      

06:59.602 --> 07:03.620
And you wonder why nobody       
      asks us out anymore.      

07:03.655 --> 07:06.006
      So how was your day?      

07:06.041 --> 07:07.658
         Ah, okay, Ma.          

07:07.693 --> 07:10.094
    Oh, our neighbor,           
    Nut Butt McNulty            

07:10.129 --> 07:11.996
    stopped in Cheers today.    

07:12.031 --> 07:14.799
    He was, uh, circulating     
    some kind of petition.      

07:14.833 --> 07:16.850
  The one to stop development?  

07:16.885 --> 07:18.419
Yeah.                           
            I signed it.        

07:18.454 --> 07:19.820
          ( <i>crashing</i> )          

07:19.854 --> 07:21.021
        You did?                

07:21.055 --> 07:23.557
        Well, who in his        
      right mind wouldn't?      

07:23.592 --> 07:26.711
         Besides you, of course.

07:26.745 --> 07:28.479
( <i>sputtering</i> )                  

07:28.513 --> 07:30.014
Ma, we-we-we're                 
for progress here.              

07:30.049 --> 07:32.984
 If we don't stop these people, 
    we could lose our home.     

07:33.018 --> 07:34.602
Well, it's                      
probably about time             

07:34.637 --> 07:36.504
    we got out of this          
        rattrap anyway.         

07:36.538 --> 07:37.571
                Clifford.       

07:37.606 --> 07:40.041
  This "rattrap" is where you,  

07:40.075 --> 07:44.045
            for want            
of a better term, grew up.      

07:44.079 --> 07:48.883
I think it's time somebody      
    looked at the scrapbook.    

07:50.552 --> 07:51.919
        Aw, come on, Ma.        

07:51.954 --> 07:53.554
    Not the scrapbook.          

07:55.190 --> 07:58.542
 Yes, Clifford, the scrapbook.  

07:59.644 --> 08:03.480
Misty watercolor memories       
of the way we were.             

08:07.019 --> 08:09.704
Oh. Look at this one.           

08:09.738 --> 08:10.821
        Ah...                   

08:10.855 --> 08:12.190
                 No, Ma. I'm not
                 gonna look.    

08:12.224 --> 08:13.824
            You're not gonna    
            get me this time.   

08:15.160 --> 08:18.229
    Oh, we had fun that day.    

08:18.231 --> 08:19.480
          ( <i>laughing</i> )          

08:19.515 --> 08:20.748
                             Ma!

08:20.782 --> 08:22.383
    It is not working.          

08:22.417 --> 08:24.017
  Oh, I'd forgotten this one.   

08:24.052 --> 08:27.120
    This has got to be          
 the handsomest picture of you  

08:27.155 --> 08:28.589
      I ever laid eyes on.      

08:34.245 --> 08:36.145
                          Which?

08:36.181 --> 08:37.514
                Oh, Ma, come on.

08:37.549 --> 08:40.517
              My ears are even  
              covered with acne.

08:42.236 --> 08:44.037
I'm your mother, Clifford.      

08:44.072 --> 08:45.873
I'm looking at your soul.       

08:47.209 --> 08:51.796
          Ah, there's me sliding
          down the old banister.

08:51.830 --> 08:53.531
I always                        
thought you spent               

08:53.565 --> 08:55.933
entirely too much time          
doing that.                     

08:56.868 --> 08:58.503
                Eh...           

08:58.537 --> 09:01.222
                 Eh, it was fun.

09:01.256 --> 09:03.174
Oh, look, there's               
your favorite                   

09:03.208 --> 09:04.942
hiding place                    
in the closet.                  

09:04.977 --> 09:05.943
                Yeah, yeah.     

09:05.978 --> 09:07.645
You used to be                  
in there for hours.             

09:07.679 --> 09:11.782
                Yeah.           

09:11.817 --> 09:12.984
             Well, that's 'cause

09:13.018 --> 09:15.552
             you always locked  
             the door on me, Ma.

09:15.587 --> 09:17.137
Well, look at the result.       

09:17.172 --> 09:19.156
You're a very                   
polite young man.               

09:20.892 --> 09:23.844
Oh, now there's                 
where we planted                

09:23.878 --> 09:26.463
the elm tree in the yard.       

09:26.498 --> 09:27.898
                    Yeah.       

09:27.933 --> 09:29.483
Oh, you named                   
him Elmer.                      

09:29.518 --> 09:30.684
                    Mm-hmm.     

09:30.718 --> 09:32.853
And look at our                 
Elmer now.                      

09:32.887 --> 09:34.789
So tall and strong.             

09:34.823 --> 09:36.156
Just like my boy.               

09:36.191 --> 09:39.143
Yeah, yeah, I can remember      
raising him from a sapling, Ma. 

09:39.177 --> 09:40.477
                I even carved   

09:40.512 --> 09:42.480
            my first slingshot  
            out of his branches.

09:42.514 --> 09:47.018
And cried every winter          
when the leaves fell.           

09:47.052 --> 09:50.621
    Yeah, yeah, that tree is    
    like a brother to me, Ma.   

09:52.157 --> 09:55.126
    Just imagine, you know,     
    something that I planted,   

09:55.160 --> 09:57.295
            and I nurtured,     
            is gonna be there   

09:57.329 --> 09:59.596
        for future              
        generations to enjoy.   

09:59.631 --> 10:05.319
Unless they chop it down        
to put up a Jiffy Lube.         

10:05.353 --> 10:07.989
      Come on, Ma, they wouldn't
      do that, would they?      

10:08.023 --> 10:11.709
They'll do that                 
as soon as look at you.         

10:14.046 --> 10:16.180
                    Well...     

10:17.349 --> 10:19.566
         Oh, Ma, no, they won't.

10:19.601 --> 10:20.567
    Oh...                       

10:20.602 --> 10:21.568
                No, Ma...       

10:21.603 --> 10:24.538
            They're not gonna   
            cut down my tree!   

10:24.572 --> 10:27.208
    A-and they're not gonna     
    touch this house either!    

10:27.242 --> 10:29.543
        And they're not         
      gonna take our land!      

10:29.577 --> 10:30.744
         That's my boy.         

10:30.779 --> 10:32.180
      Where are you going?      

10:32.214 --> 10:35.183
Well, it may sound              
a little bit silly              

10:35.217 --> 10:37.351
and all, Ma, but, uh...         

10:37.385 --> 10:40.588
     I'm gonna go out there     
      and sit in my tree.       

10:41.623 --> 10:43.373
      You got right ahead.      

10:47.262 --> 10:48.595
          Never fails.          

10:54.018 --> 10:56.437
Well, uh,                       
interestingly enough,           

10:56.471 --> 10:59.307
Yorkshire pudding               
was invented in the 1700s       

10:59.341 --> 11:01.042
during a beef shortage.         

11:02.143 --> 11:03.511
  All right, stop everything.   

11:03.545 --> 11:05.178
  I've got a major news flash.  

11:05.213 --> 11:07.080
I just had lunch                
with Miss Howe's                

11:07.115 --> 11:08.516
former college classmate        

11:08.550 --> 11:11.886
and it seems that she           
had a nickname at UConn.        

11:11.920 --> 11:13.253
          Give, give.           

11:13.288 --> 11:14.705
Well, he wasn't sure            
how she came by                 

11:14.740 --> 11:16.941
this appellation,               
but it seems that at some point 

11:16.975 --> 11:18.508
during her little               
sojourn there,                  

11:18.543 --> 11:21.796
she became known                
as "Backseat Becky."

             What do you        
             suppose that means?

11:31.139 --> 11:32.540
    Woody.                      

11:32.574 --> 11:33.724
                 What that means
                 is when Miss...

    let someone who's           
      been there, tell it?

      her cushion pushin'

11:42.167 --> 11:43.801
                      Miss Howe?

11:43.835 --> 11:44.969

              where I come from,

11:47.239 --> 11:48.906

        about girls like that.

11:57.933 --> 11:59.850
Oh, looky here. You know,       
    something tells me

12:07.759 --> 12:08.893
      about nicknames, you know.

    Different funny nicknames   
    that people have.           

12:10.796 --> 12:12.029
                Did you ever    
                have a nickname?

12:12.063 --> 12:13.697
As a matter of fact, no.        

12:13.731 --> 12:14.832
                    Really.     

12:14.866 --> 12:16.033

             that, uh, kinda

     uh, that works for me.     

12:51.720 --> 12:53.988
    I kind of like "Bubba."     

12:55.523 --> 12:56.890
Oh, God.                        

12:56.925 --> 12:59.576
Then you probably know          
the whole sordid story.         

12:59.611 --> 13:02.380
Well, actually, no.             

13:02.414 --> 13:03.580
Well, that's because            
there isn't one.                

13:03.615 --> 13:05.182
     Hey, hey, come on, come on.
     Don't worry about that.    

13:05.217 --> 13:06.217
            Listen, the truth is

13:06.251 --> 13:07.851
            I'm looking         
            to buy a new car,   

13:07.886 --> 13:09.953
            and I, uh, I need   
            an expert opinion.  

13:09.988 --> 13:11.889
                    Uh...       

13:11.923 --> 13:14.625
         now what-what...       
         what model do you think

13:14.660 --> 13:15.893
    has the best rear shocks?   

13:15.927 --> 13:18.029
          ( <i>laughter</i> )          

13:18.063 --> 13:21.699
Have you driven                 
a Ford lately?                  

13:23.936 --> 13:27.405
 I guess she gives new meaning  
to the term "four on the floor."

13:29.574 --> 13:31.242
     All right, all right.      

13:31.276 --> 13:33.511
         If you insist          
    on an explanation,          

13:33.545 --> 13:35.246
     I will give it to you.     

13:35.280 --> 13:36.747
     You know how sometimes     
        as a joke,              

13:36.781 --> 13:38.515
        you call someone        
    the exact opposite          

13:38.550 --> 13:39.916
    of what they really are?    

13:39.951 --> 13:42.052
     Well, I was really shy     
          in college,           

13:42.086 --> 13:43.821
     so my friends thought      
     it would be a huge gas     

13:43.855 --> 13:45.489
  to call me "Backseat Becky."  

13:45.524 --> 13:47.792
    ( <i>faint chuckle</i> )           

13:47.826 --> 13:50.661
             Well, it's simple, 
             it's, it's logical,

13:50.695 --> 13:52.479
            and we don't believe
            it for a second.    

13:54.032 --> 13:55.532
                Wait a minute.  
                I-I believe her.

13:55.566 --> 13:57.268
              Us virgins have   
              to stick together.

13:59.771 --> 14:01.739
I told you the truth.           

14:01.773 --> 14:04.408
    If you don't want           
      to believe it, fine,      

14:04.442 --> 14:05.609
just believe whatever you want. 

14:07.379 --> 14:09.413
        All right,              
     here's the real truth.     

14:09.447 --> 14:13.851
     I was very aggressive      
 in college, a real go-getter.  

14:13.885 --> 14:17.254
    I never took a backseat     
        to anyone.              

14:20.274 --> 14:21.475
          No. No, no.           

14:25.596 --> 14:27.998
        No, Mr. Cronin,         
    I'm not listening.          

14:28.033 --> 14:29.400
             The case is closed.

14:29.434 --> 14:31.201
                  I'm not taking
                  any offers,   

14:31.236 --> 14:32.702
and that's final.               

14:32.737 --> 14:35.105
I'm sorry if I've               
upset you, Mrs. Clavin.         

14:35.140 --> 14:37.774
Clifford, would you             
tell this gentleman, please,    

14:37.809 --> 14:39.310
we're not selling               
our house?                      

14:39.344 --> 14:40.477
I was just                      

14:40.511 --> 14:42.046
trying to make an offer         
on your house,                  

14:42.080 --> 14:43.314
and your mother                 
won't listen.                   

14:43.348 --> 14:45.882
Well, that's because            
she has got more sense          

14:45.917 --> 14:47.384
in her bony little frame        

14:47.419 --> 14:49.053
than you have                   
in your little finger.          

14:50.155 --> 14:52.490
    Reverse that.               

14:53.975 --> 14:57.177
    You are not going           
to run the Clavins off our land.

14:57.211 --> 14:58.712
          I don't care          
    what you offer us,          

14:58.747 --> 15:00.714
    you just can't put          
        a price on love,        

15:00.749 --> 15:04.635
family and our memories.        

15:04.669 --> 15:06.937
     Take it or leave it--      

15:06.971 --> 15:08.905
        $250,000.               

15:08.940 --> 15:10.290
                     $200 and...

15:10.324 --> 15:12.760
                     Oh, my God,
                     we're rich.

15:21.252 --> 15:23.287
              But Ma, Ma,       
              you can't do this.

15:23.321 --> 15:25.289
 A Clavin cannot be bought off. 

15:25.323 --> 15:28.942
    I'm only a Clavin           
     by marriage, Clifford.     

15:30.478 --> 15:31.345
Oh...                           

15:31.463 --> 15:33.264
  Oh, guys, you gotta help me.  

15:33.298 --> 15:35.499
              She's going to go 
              through with this.

15:35.533 --> 15:37.301
Well, why don't you offer       
to buy the place back?          

15:37.336 --> 15:41.705
Sammy, I don't have             
enough money for a down payment.

15:41.739 --> 15:42.974
Wait a minute.                  

15:43.008 --> 15:45.076
Can either of you guys          
lend me $50,000?                

15:45.110 --> 15:45.977
          ( <i>chuckles</i> )          

15:46.011 --> 15:48.379
        I'm sorry, Cliff, you   
        never paid me back      

15:48.413 --> 15:50.080
                that million    
                from last week. 

15:50.115 --> 15:51.315
                Well, it's been 
                a pleasure      

15:51.349 --> 15:53.150
        doing business          
        with you, Mrs. Clavin.  

15:53.185 --> 15:54.185
Thank you.                      

15:54.219 --> 15:56.987
                     Uh... uh...

15:57.022 --> 15:58.122
                          There!

15:58.156 --> 15:59.489
             There!             

15:59.524 --> 16:02.059
 Now what are you going to do?  

16:02.093 --> 16:03.427
Well, first I'm going           

16:03.461 --> 16:06.096
     to take this contract      
      down to the office,       

16:06.131 --> 16:07.497
    and then I'm going          

16:07.532 --> 16:09.333
        to call my wife         
 and ask her what I'm supposed  

16:09.367 --> 16:10.734
to pick up at the grocery store.

16:13.972 --> 16:15.622
Ah, Ma,                         

16:15.657 --> 16:17.607
          but after all we've   
          been through together.

16:17.642 --> 16:19.076
Just last night you were saying 

16:19.110 --> 16:20.644
how much the house meant to you.

16:20.678 --> 16:22.646
Last night I was poor.          

16:22.680 --> 16:24.148
Tonight I'm not.                

16:24.182 --> 16:26.650
I never thought                 
I'd have the chance,            

16:26.684 --> 16:28.618
but now                         
I can go to Florida.            

16:28.653 --> 16:30.721
                Florida? Oh, for
                crying out loud.

16:30.755 --> 16:33.590
         Who'd ever want to live
         in that stinkhole?     

16:34.208 --> 16:36.193
Clifford,                       
I'm doing this                  

16:36.228 --> 16:38.729
as much for you                 
as I am for myself.             

16:38.763 --> 16:40.297
You're 39 years old.            

16:40.332 --> 16:41.798
It's time to cut the cord.      

16:41.833 --> 16:43.967
             Ma, I am not       
             leaving that house!

16:44.002 --> 16:45.136
Clifford...                     

16:45.170 --> 16:47.471
                I am not leaving
                that house!     

16:47.506 --> 16:51.175
Well, I'm afraid                
you're going to have to.        

16:51.209 --> 16:53.210
      Oh! Oh, yeah, fine.       

16:53.245 --> 16:55.279
      Go off by yourself.       

16:55.313 --> 16:56.813
      See how you like it.      

16:56.848 --> 16:58.649
    After a week of cooking     
        your own meals,         

16:58.683 --> 17:00.484
     doing your own dishes,     
     washing your own hair,     

17:00.519 --> 17:01.718
        you'll be back.         

17:14.683 --> 17:15.781
        Oh, well, well, well,   

17:15.816 --> 17:19.185
if it isn't the ultimate        
driving machine.                

17:19.220 --> 17:21.488
     Okay, okay, I give up.     

17:22.140 --> 17:23.891
      Look, I'll tell you       
        the real story,         

17:23.925 --> 17:25.025
                but it's kind   
                of personal     

17:25.059 --> 17:26.627
            so can we do this   
            in private?         

17:26.661 --> 17:27.794
Sure, you bet.                  
You bet.                        

17:27.829 --> 17:30.631
Say, if you're                  
too embarrassed                 
to say something,               

17:30.665 --> 17:31.998
feel free                       
to act it out.                  

17:35.904 --> 17:37.872
    I was living in a           
    women's dorm on campus...   

17:37.906 --> 17:38.873
Mm-hmm.                         

17:38.907 --> 17:40.474
            ...and one night    
            a fire broke out.   

17:40.509 --> 17:41.709
    Ah.                         

17:41.743 --> 17:43.243
        Well, I didn't have time
        to change my clothes,   

17:43.277 --> 17:44.644
             so I had to run out
             to the parking lot 

17:44.679 --> 17:45.879
        wearing only a teddy;   

17:45.914 --> 17:48.883
                black,          
                but see-through.

17:48.917 --> 17:51.735
                All of a sudden,
                I was caught    

17:51.769 --> 17:53.386
        in this fire engine's   
        headlights.             

17:53.421 --> 17:55.005
    I didn't know what to do.   

17:55.039 --> 17:57.057
            I looked all around,
            and suddenly,       

17:57.091 --> 17:58.993
            I spotted this      
            open convertible.   

17:59.027 --> 18:01.595
                I climbed in,   
                and I slunk down

18:01.630 --> 18:03.263
                to the backseat.

18:03.297 --> 18:06.600
                 Suddenly, this 
                 hulking fireman

18:06.634 --> 18:08.669
        was standing over me.   

18:08.703 --> 18:10.738
             He was magnificent.

18:12.723 --> 18:14.808
        I looked in his eyes.   

18:14.842 --> 18:16.760
          I knew what he wanted,

18:16.794 --> 18:18.161
        and I wanted it, too.   

18:19.647 --> 18:23.734
          I peeled off his black
          rubber raincoat.      

18:23.768 --> 18:26.703
         He ripped off my teddy.

18:28.656 --> 18:32.492
            I can still feel the
            heat on my flesh.   

18:35.130 --> 18:37.364
        But it wasn't the fire--

18:37.399 --> 18:39.499
                it was us.      

18:39.534 --> 18:41.535
            When it was over,   

18:41.569 --> 18:42.836
            I opened my eyes,   

18:42.870 --> 18:45.322
            and I noticed       
            we weren't alone.   

18:45.356 --> 18:49.276
            Others had watched  
            and not said a word.

18:51.529 --> 18:55.098
        And that's why I'm known
        as "Backseat Becky."    

18:55.133 --> 18:56.267
                Satisfied?      

19:09.847 --> 19:11.615
                  Thanks for the
                  story, Carla. 

19:11.649 --> 19:14.184
          Here's your ten bucks.

19:17.989 --> 19:21.458
Yeah, the $20 one               
would have killed him.          

19:22.960 --> 19:24.061
So wait a minute.               
Wait a minute.                  

19:24.095 --> 19:26.663
Why do they call you            
"Backseat Becky."               

19:26.697 --> 19:28.699
                  That will cost
                  you a hundred.

19:28.733 --> 19:32.235
Hey, you know,                  
you're kind of a pig.           

19:33.337 --> 19:35.238
Maybe we can be friends.        

19:37.909 --> 19:38.976
        Excuse me.

I've got to find                
Norm Peterson.                  

19:42.380 --> 19:44.548
          Does Mr. Peterson know
          what this is about?   

19:44.583 --> 19:46.050
Never mind.                     
There he is.                    

19:46.084 --> 19:48.752

                    Hi.         

19:48.787 --> 19:49.987
You got to help me.

I'm desperate.                  
                    What?       

19:51.222 --> 19:53.457
Cliff's locked himself          
in the house.                   

19:53.491 --> 19:54.959
No, I've tried everything.

He won't budge.                 

19:56.160 --> 19:57.795
Ours is the last house          
on the block                    

19:57.829 --> 20:00.464
scheduled for demolition,       
and that's today.               

20:00.498 --> 20:01.665
I'm at my wit's end.

You got to help me.             

20:02.901 --> 20:04.868
            I'll talk to him.   

20:04.903 --> 20:06.320
         I'll see what I can do.

20:06.354 --> 20:07.520
            Oh, thank you, Norm.

20:07.555 --> 20:09.689
             I hope he doesn't  
             try anything crazy.

20:09.724 --> 20:11.825
    The last thing on Earth     
         I want to see          

20:11.860 --> 20:14.661
is my son's face                
on the 11:00 news.              

20:14.695 --> 20:18.047
 There's a whole city out there 
      that agrees with ya.

          now take off          
     those silly handcuffs.

            I can't.            

21:14.972 --> 21:16.190
    I flushed the key.

if you can find some tin snips.

  He loaned us the hard hats.

         Clifford, sometimes I  
         really worry about you.

21:30.688 --> 21:32.739
Look what they did to Elmer.    

21:35.676 --> 21:40.346
        I'm sorry, dear,        
      but what can we do?       

21:40.381 --> 21:42.015
Come on, Ma,                    
you're the one who taught me

in something,

to have to fight for it.

    The house is sold.          

21:48.472 --> 21:49.907
 They're going to tear it down. 

21:49.941 --> 21:52.592
Well, then I am going           
down with it.                   

21:52.627 --> 21:55.712
        Clifford,               

21:55.746 --> 22:00.333
  does this house really mean   
    that much to you?           

22:00.367 --> 22:01.634
        Yeah, Ma.

What? No, no. I'm wearing
