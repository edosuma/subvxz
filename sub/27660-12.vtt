00:03.370 --> 00:05.081
Previously,
on "Future Man"...

00:05.082 --> 00:06.793
Pointed Circle hit us.

00:06.794 --> 00:10.174
You wound up on your back
courtesy of Wolf and Joosh.

00:10.175 --> 00:12.136
Somehow your former friends
figured out a weakness

00:12.137 --> 00:14.600
- in my code.
- I'm Stu's poison pill.

00:14.601 --> 00:17.105
He's afraid of me.
If my brain is uploaded

00:17.106 --> 00:19.317
- I can crash the whole system.
- There's only one way

00:19.318 --> 00:21.280
to the upload machines:
You're gonna have to get past

00:21.281 --> 00:23.450
the commandos.
Once inside, you're gonna have

00:23.451 --> 00:25.371
to beat the facial
recognition scanner.

00:25.372 --> 00:28.294
- I think we'll be just fine.
- The evil robot emperor, Stu,

00:28.295 --> 00:30.006
will unleash
his killing machines

00:30.007 --> 00:32.468
if you attack the Mons.

00:32.469 --> 00:34.849
- You're making a huge mistake!
- This is way above

00:34.850 --> 00:36.310
your pay grade, okay?
I'm J1.

00:36.311 --> 00:38.022
I'm J1.

00:41.530 --> 00:43.365
- Joosh?
- I'm gonna shut myself down

00:43.366 --> 00:45.621
really quick, and then
I'm gonna upload him anyway

00:45.622 --> 00:48.000
and torture him
for all eternity.

00:48.001 --> 00:50.756
- Hoo-ah!
- There's no spaceship!

00:50.757 --> 00:52.008
There's no MARS!

00:52.009 --> 00:53.678
It's all lies!

00:53.679 --> 00:55.515
Release the kill-bots.

01:23.948 --> 01:25.701
Move, soldier.

01:49.165 --> 01:51.126
- They're all dead.
- Not all of them.

01:51.127 --> 01:53.506
I can still hear
a few screaming.

01:59.393 --> 02:02.566
Well, at least
their suffering's over.

02:02.567 --> 02:04.820
My Cluster.

02:04.821 --> 02:07.868
- Their blood is on my hands.
- It's not your fault.

02:07.869 --> 02:10.081
And on my arms, and my knees,

02:10.082 --> 02:12.545
and my face, and...

02:16.762 --> 02:18.681
Yeah, that's Thimble.

02:18.682 --> 02:21.855
Her blood is just as sweet
as she is.

02:23.692 --> 02:25.444
Was.

02:25.445 --> 02:28.618
That sweet blood is on me.

02:28.619 --> 02:30.496
I was blinded by self-pity.

02:30.497 --> 02:33.168
I couldn't see Stu
for what he really was.

02:33.169 --> 02:35.089
El Diablo.

02:37.094 --> 02:39.849
- What are those?
- PSK's.

02:39.850 --> 02:41.686
Personal Suicide Kits.

02:41.687 --> 02:42.980
I mean, our war is lost.

02:42.981 --> 02:44.775
We're holed up in a bunker.

02:44.776 --> 02:47.071
It can't get much lower
than this.

02:47.072 --> 02:49.075
Which dot goes
on which temple?

02:49.076 --> 02:51.121
- It doesn't matter.
- That's good design.

02:51.122 --> 02:52.624
- Yeah.
- Really?

02:52.625 --> 02:54.002
You guys are throwing in
the towel because of a--

02:54.003 --> 02:55.379
a couple invincible
killer robots?

02:55.380 --> 02:57.258
- Yeah, pretty much.
- Yeah, yeah.

02:57.259 --> 02:59.179
Well, 12 million, actually.

02:59.180 --> 03:01.726
Well, that doesn't work
for me.

03:01.727 --> 03:03.395
That--that will not be the end
of my story.

03:03.396 --> 03:05.441
Cool, more murder dots
for me.

03:05.442 --> 03:08.197
You know, looking back at it,

03:08.198 --> 03:10.326
I think I most regret
picking that voice

03:10.327 --> 03:13.332
- when I was 14.
- You really fucking sold it.

03:13.333 --> 03:16.171
Oh, it was exhausting
and ultimately fruitless.

03:16.172 --> 03:19.302
Wish I had spent less time
at the shop and...

03:19.303 --> 03:22.350
- more with Lugnut.
- Where do I start?

03:22.351 --> 03:25.356
I made a lot of bad decisions.

03:25.357 --> 03:28.696
Well, I guess the one that
hurts the most is when I...

03:28.697 --> 03:31.661
stuck my hand in Stu's
brain goo and just even

03:31.662 --> 03:33.790
gave him one flick of pleasure.

03:35.878 --> 03:38.257
Okay, yeah, all right, I...

03:38.258 --> 03:41.304
- I felt a little tingle, too.
- Wait, you saw Stu's brain?

03:41.305 --> 03:42.641
I more than saw it.

03:42.642 --> 03:45.605
- I jobbed it to completion.
- Oh.

03:45.606 --> 03:48.026
- "Komputaboinken."
- How would that even work?

03:48.027 --> 03:51.157
We spent years looking
for Stu's core processor.

03:51.158 --> 03:54.080
If you can lead us to it
then we--we can take Stu down.

03:54.081 --> 03:55.249
It's too well defended.

03:55.250 --> 03:57.963
We'd never get past security.

03:57.964 --> 04:00.969
Unless--
unless the system's down.

04:00.970 --> 04:03.015
Guys, just get me as close
as you can to Stu

04:03.016 --> 04:04.768
and then I'll--
I'll do my thing.

04:04.769 --> 04:07.398
- I'll fritz him out.
- Yeah, he patched himself,

04:07.399 --> 04:10.029
so any power you had...

04:10.030 --> 04:13.036
it's gone.

04:15.791 --> 04:19.297
That was all I had.

04:19.298 --> 04:21.886
Yeah, but...

04:21.887 --> 04:23.848
we do have this.

04:23.849 --> 04:26.687
There's enough Cameronium here
to level that mountain.

04:26.688 --> 04:30.319
Wolf, you too sad
to build a dirty bomb?

04:30.320 --> 04:32.657
Wait, I have a better idea.

04:35.623 --> 04:37.501
- What the--
- That's impossible.

04:37.502 --> 04:39.253
- I saw that blow up.
- A reproduction

04:39.254 --> 04:41.299
reverse-engineered
from this one.

04:41.300 --> 04:43.178
You really thought we were
stupid enough to test

04:43.179 --> 04:45.642
experimental fuel on the only
time-travel device

04:45.643 --> 04:47.228
- in existence?
- Yup.

04:47.229 --> 04:49.566
It pretty much informed
every decision

04:49.567 --> 04:52.364
I've made since then.

04:53.324 --> 04:55.494
- Guys, this is great.
- This is great.

04:55.495 --> 04:57.081
Okay, so--so what do we do?

04:57.082 --> 04:59.001
We--we jump back
to right before

04:59.002 --> 05:01.005
Stu patches himself,
I take out the other me,

05:01.006 --> 05:02.717
I get in his place in line,
don't fight

05:02.718 --> 05:04.930
with Jimmy McGurgin,
upload myself, and we now have

05:04.931 --> 05:06.976
a super dead supercomputer,
right?

05:06.977 --> 05:10.650
- Mm, probably.
- "Probably."

05:10.651 --> 05:13.280
You just sent me to die

05:13.281 --> 05:15.242
- for a "probably"?
- We were never 100%

05:15.243 --> 05:16.787
that uploading you
was gonna work.

05:16.788 --> 05:19.041
Like, 78%.

05:19.042 --> 05:20.712
It was Plan B, but it was
the best plan that we had.

05:20.713 --> 05:23.300
Plan A was always
destroy Stu's core processor.

05:23.301 --> 05:26.222
That's 100%,
and now we can do that.

05:26.223 --> 05:28.686
When Stu patched himself
he shut down for 11 seconds.

05:28.687 --> 05:31.107
We jump back to that moment,
all his defenses are down.

05:31.108 --> 05:33.069
We stroll in there,
smash that brain.

05:33.070 --> 05:34.322
Too much ground to cover.

05:34.323 --> 05:36.409
We'd never get there in time.

05:36.410 --> 05:39.500
Unless we buy ourselves
more time.

05:40.961 --> 05:43.048
When we use the TTD,

05:43.049 --> 05:45.595
we jump in time, but not space.

05:45.596 --> 05:47.557
Thus, if we run 11 seconds,

05:47.558 --> 05:50.354
let's say we get
to about here.

05:50.355 --> 05:53.109
If we jump when we're here,

05:53.110 --> 05:54.571
we'd still be in
the same exact place,

05:54.572 --> 05:56.407
just 11 seconds earlier,
you see?

05:56.408 --> 05:58.746
We can just keep running
and jumping,

05:58.747 --> 06:00.500
running and jumping,
running and jumping,

06:00.501 --> 06:02.587
extending our window
for as much time as we need

06:02.588 --> 06:05.133
until we're past Stu's defenses
inside the core processor.

06:05.134 --> 06:08.348
Then, we give him
a brain job...

06:08.349 --> 06:10.938
he will never forget.

06:13.150 --> 06:15.613
Because he'll--he'll be dead.

06:15.614 --> 06:17.659
Or he won't remember
because he'll be--

06:17.660 --> 06:19.830
- we'll kill him.
- Yeah, I love this plan.

06:19.831 --> 06:21.124
It's a winner.

06:21.125 --> 06:23.336
I'm in--right after this.

06:26.093 --> 06:28.263
God...

06:35.111 --> 06:36.781
Corey!

06:42.501 --> 06:44.253
Oh, I haven't seen you
in, like, a week, man.

06:44.254 --> 06:46.215
I was just to get
OJ's car cleaned.

06:46.216 --> 06:47.677
You were right about him.

06:47.678 --> 06:49.765
- He is a great guy.
- Yeah, I told you.

06:49.766 --> 06:51.685
- Yeah, what's up?
- Oh, I need you to do me

06:51.686 --> 06:53.355
- a solid, Blaze.
- Anything.

06:53.356 --> 06:55.400
- Cool, cool.
- Make a quick trip to Utah.

06:55.401 --> 06:57.071
Infiltrate a community
where polygamy

06:57.072 --> 06:58.908
is tacitly accepted,
marry all these

06:58.909 --> 07:00.745
beautiful people,
provide for them,

07:00.746 --> 07:04.210
and, uh, raise this
special little girl, Lugnut,

07:04.211 --> 07:06.840
as if she was your own.

07:06.841 --> 07:08.134
Okay.

07:08.135 --> 07:11.767
So which one's Tugboat?

07:11.768 --> 07:14.021
Of all the places
in the world,

07:14.022 --> 07:15.817
right here at OJ's

07:15.818 --> 07:18.531
in 1993 is the safest.

07:18.532 --> 07:20.952
Life will be simpler
for you here.

07:23.709 --> 07:26.462
Can't you stay
a little bit longer, fake papa?

07:37.277 --> 07:40.115
Had to secure the Cluster.

07:40.116 --> 07:43.455
I couldn't help but skip
to a few milestones.

07:43.456 --> 07:45.710
I just walked Lugnut
down the aisle.

07:45.711 --> 07:47.212
Wolf, you have
a time machine.

07:47.213 --> 07:49.593
- Why are you 10 minutes late?
- Oh, sorry.

07:49.594 --> 07:52.515
I'm still on island time.

07:52.516 --> 07:54.393
It was a destination wedding.

07:54.394 --> 07:57.902
Oh, one guess who I booked
to play the reception.

07:58.695 --> 08:00.782
No?
No one's the least bit curious

08:00.783 --> 08:03.496
about who I booked to...

08:05.082 --> 08:07.127
Fine.
You don't get to know, then.

08:07.128 --> 08:08.881
Okay...

08:08.882 --> 08:11.177
so when we jump, we're gonna
give ourselves enough time

08:11.178 --> 08:13.473
to get into position
inside of Stu's compound.

08:13.474 --> 08:15.812
Then, when he goes
to patch himself,

08:15.813 --> 08:18.441
- we make our run.
- Well, here's a little hiccup:

08:18.442 --> 08:20.822
The secret entrance
to Stu's compound

08:20.823 --> 08:23.243
is inside the hangar,
so you three are gonna have

08:23.244 --> 08:25.205
to get through there,
avoid Stu, his commandos--

08:25.206 --> 08:26.750
- And the other us's.
- Keep in mind, guys,

08:26.751 --> 08:29.213
"Back to the Future 2" rules
do apply here.

08:29.214 --> 08:31.467
- What?
- Uh, just ignore him.

08:31.468 --> 08:32.637
Wolf.

08:32.638 --> 08:35.225
Fire up the TTD.

08:42.616 --> 08:44.661
I'm not going with you.

08:46.081 --> 08:47.499
These are my people.

08:47.500 --> 08:49.796
I'm their leader.

08:49.797 --> 08:51.967
I can't just leave them here
to die.

08:55.057 --> 08:57.896
Their fate is my fate.

08:57.897 --> 09:00.944
God damn it.

09:10.839 --> 09:13.928
You're gonna have to recruit
the me from three hours ago.

09:13.929 --> 09:16.432
Don't worry, she'll get it.

09:29.334 --> 09:30.878
Okay, guys.

09:30.879 --> 09:34.259
Time to save the world again.

09:34.260 --> 09:36.640
It was Hoobastank.

09:41.316 --> 09:42.902
Stay tight to that HAB unit,
soldier.

09:42.903 --> 09:44.864
One hair to the left
and you're made.

09:48.957 --> 09:51.252
- We--we can explain.
- Totally get it.

09:51.253 --> 09:53.590
What's your plan
for getting into the hangar?

09:53.591 --> 09:55.343
How many guards
you say there were?

09:55.344 --> 09:56.763
- Uh, two.
- Can you show us

09:56.764 --> 09:58.642
- where the guard house is?
- You thinking

09:58.643 --> 10:01.272
- Otter's Mousetrap?
- Only play that makes sense.

10:01.273 --> 10:05.363
Spacecraft will transport
you to a new world.

10:05.364 --> 10:08.161
A world
of boundless potential.

10:08.162 --> 10:10.541
A world free
from the limitations

10:10.542 --> 10:12.962
- of life on this dying planet.
- Don't look at me!

10:12.963 --> 10:14.674
It's not pretty.

10:14.675 --> 10:17.680
I'm a monster.

10:19.769 --> 10:22.815
Medical emergency.

10:25.614 --> 10:27.449
Thank you.

10:28.661 --> 10:31.207
Sorry, my friend's in there.

10:36.093 --> 10:38.514
You're going to enter...

10:38.515 --> 10:40.976
Once you make it through,
you will reach

10:40.977 --> 10:43.524
the antechamber,
where you will be issued

10:43.525 --> 10:47.197
your very own space helmets!

10:57.761 --> 10:59.514
Okay, the hidden hatch
to the compound

10:59.515 --> 11:01.350
is on the other side
of the hangar.

11:01.351 --> 11:03.438
You're doing great.
This is gonna work.

11:03.439 --> 11:06.402
- I knew it would.
- You will then be--

11:06.403 --> 11:09.116
- The younger me.
- So naive, full of hope.

11:09.117 --> 11:10.619
We'll be taking--

11:10.620 --> 11:12.497
Don't let him see you.

11:12.498 --> 11:14.376
- I know he can't see anything.
- His eyes are swollen shut.

11:14.377 --> 11:15.838
Trust me.
All right, we should

11:15.839 --> 11:17.967
- keep moving.
- Get ready to travel

11:17.968 --> 11:20.723
to a brave new world.

11:25.734 --> 11:29.156
Yeah, take a long look
at my disgusting--

11:29.157 --> 11:31.786
You will be pioneers
fulfilling our manifest--

11:31.787 --> 11:33.624
Dick.

11:33.625 --> 11:35.669
Previously unimaginable--

11:35.670 --> 11:37.380
I'd recognize
that bulge anywhere.

11:37.381 --> 11:40.053
- Quick, he's on to you.
- What?

11:40.054 --> 11:42.140
- What?
- Uh--uh, no.

11:42.141 --> 11:43.476
Nothing.
Uh, sorry.

11:43.477 --> 11:45.355
There's no one--
no one's on to you.

11:45.356 --> 11:47.025
It's all--everything's great.

11:47.026 --> 11:48.737
Plan is going--going great.
You're doing great.

11:48.738 --> 11:50.240
No, no, no, something's up.

11:50.241 --> 11:52.160
There's also an
all-you-can-eat taco bar.

11:52.161 --> 11:54.666
on every spacecraft.

12:10.489 --> 12:12.367
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.

12:16.001 --> 12:18.296
There is someone I would
very much like

12:18.297 --> 12:21.051
to formally introduce you to.

12:26.856 --> 12:29.569
- I knew it.
- Hey, buddy.

12:32.408 --> 12:34.829
- We can explain.
- Wait, are you me?

12:34.830 --> 12:36.541
What the fuck is happening here?

12:36.542 --> 12:38.712
- I'm mad at you.
- I know, it's confusing.

12:38.713 --> 12:40.465
- Okay, what are you doing?
- We need her

12:40.466 --> 12:43.095
on that reviewing stand now.
Stu is introducing her.

12:43.096 --> 12:45.183
- Yeah, I'm working on it.
- Who are you talking to?

12:45.184 --> 12:46.435
- Ty-Anne.
- She's great.

12:46.436 --> 12:48.231
You were wrong
about everything.

12:48.232 --> 12:49.274
Just give us two seconds
to explain what's going on.

12:49.275 --> 12:51.320
That is what's going on?

12:51.321 --> 12:52.823
That's crazy!

12:52.824 --> 12:55.078
- I ate a nut for nothing?
- N-no, not for nothing.

12:55.079 --> 12:56.998
I mean, you--you are very,
very important.

12:56.999 --> 13:00.129
Yeah, not as important
as you.

13:00.130 --> 13:02.300
Well, uh, you're--
you're essential.

13:02.301 --> 13:05.264
I mean this whole plan hinges
upon Stu noticing you

13:05.265 --> 13:07.394
and patching himself.

13:07.395 --> 13:09.607
What, so I'm a decoy now?

13:09.608 --> 13:11.402
I am J1!

13:11.403 --> 13:14.199
You cannot make me
into a decoy.

13:14.200 --> 13:16.286
Okay, we gotta get
Nut-Face Josh back

13:16.287 --> 13:19.126
to the front of the line.

13:19.127 --> 13:22.340
- I'm "Nut-Face Josh" now?
- Son of a--

13:22.341 --> 13:24.512
mm, I gotta label my buttons.

13:24.513 --> 13:26.599
- That's on me.
- She is gonna be here

13:26.600 --> 13:28.352
any minute, and you're gonna
love her.

13:28.353 --> 13:30.273
She's great.

13:30.274 --> 13:32.318
Find my girlfriend.

13:32.319 --> 13:35.617
Okay, so long story short,
you're just trying

13:35.618 --> 13:37.370
- to ruin my big day.
- "Your big day"?

13:37.371 --> 13:40.001
Do you hear yourself?
I'm here because I realized

13:40.002 --> 13:42.798
- you/me is a complete idiot.
- You're just jealous.

13:42.799 --> 13:46.180
- You're psychotic.
- Whoa, easy Tigers.

13:46.181 --> 13:48.309
Hey, it's me.

13:48.310 --> 13:50.396
The Wolf from three hours
from now.

13:50.397 --> 13:53.904
The Wolf that's finally learned
a few things.

13:53.905 --> 13:56.450
Look, it doesn't matter
if you're a Biotic.

13:56.451 --> 13:59.039
Or a Bio-Tech or...

13:59.040 --> 14:01.795
a filthy, no-good Chope.

14:01.796 --> 14:05.009
All that matters
is that you're you.

14:05.010 --> 14:07.013
We've all made mistakes.

14:07.014 --> 14:10.019
I know I'm sorry
for how I treated you.

14:12.818 --> 14:14.529
Right now you don't want
to hear the truth, I get it.

14:14.530 --> 14:16.825
I get it, I--I've been there.

14:16.826 --> 14:18.829
Just--just go in peace.

14:18.830 --> 14:22.126
Rejoin your hologram boyfriend
for the pretend MARS launch

14:22.127 --> 14:23.839
just like everything's
perfectly normal.

14:23.840 --> 14:25.884
That's all we ask.

14:25.885 --> 14:28.849
I got an idea.

14:28.850 --> 14:32.146
How about you eat the nut
and I take your place?

14:32.147 --> 14:33.775
That's kinda dumb.

14:33.776 --> 14:36.405
You already ate the nut
and your throat's closed.

14:36.406 --> 14:38.743
So is yours!

14:42.167 --> 14:44.004
Okay, you have got
to get her back up there.

14:44.005 --> 14:46.926
- We are out of time.
- Okay, you convinced me.

14:46.927 --> 14:49.222
I'll do it,
but only because I care

14:49.223 --> 14:51.435
about what happens
to humanity.

14:55.444 --> 14:57.698
- She was gonna rat us out?
- How'd you know?

14:57.699 --> 14:59.451
'Cause I only talk
about my feelings

14:59.452 --> 15:01.038
- when I'm lying.
- Quick question:

15:01.039 --> 15:03.459
Are any of you capable
of staying on-mission?

15:03.460 --> 15:05.338
I'm trying...

15:05.339 --> 15:08.469
Listen, man, this mission
is about saving humanity.

15:08.470 --> 15:11.935
- Not about who's J1.
- Yeah, says J1.

15:13.773 --> 15:15.859
- You're too strong.
- Yeah, man.

15:15.860 --> 15:17.614
You too.

15:18.783 --> 15:21.078
You know what?
You're right.

15:21.079 --> 15:22.790
It is about number.

15:22.791 --> 15:25.002
The number of people
that are gonna die

15:25.003 --> 15:27.131
if you don't get to the front
of that line so that Stu

15:27.132 --> 15:28.510
- can see you.
- So, what?

15:28.511 --> 15:30.681
I'm supposed to just
sacrifice myself

15:30.682 --> 15:32.601
and either get murdered
by a bunch of robots

15:32.602 --> 15:35.272
or stuck all alone
in this shit timeline

15:35.273 --> 15:38.028
while you and Wolf and Tiger
get all the glory

15:38.029 --> 15:41.368
- and go out and seize the world?
- Hey.

15:41.369 --> 15:43.873
Look, you--you're playing
your part, too.

15:43.874 --> 15:46.128
All right, do--do you think
that those soldiers

15:46.129 --> 15:47.840
that got mowed down
on Omaha Beach

15:47.841 --> 15:49.593
are any less important
than the one that smashed

15:49.594 --> 15:51.931
through the Berlin Wall
and killed Hitler?

15:51.932 --> 15:53.308
Do you remember any
of their names?

15:53.309 --> 15:54.979
No.
Does that matter?

15:54.980 --> 15:57.400
No, because they are
still heroes, and that--

15:57.401 --> 15:59.697
that is why
the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier

15:59.698 --> 16:02.201
is among the most popular tombs
in the entire world.

16:04.498 --> 16:07.378
God damn it, you're good.

16:10.218 --> 16:12.013
Fine, I'll do it.

16:12.014 --> 16:14.727
Hey, brave face.

16:16.857 --> 16:19.277
Close enough.

16:19.278 --> 16:21.700
Go get 'em, soldier.

16:24.581 --> 16:27.210
You're gonna do great.

16:27.211 --> 16:29.840
Thank God.

16:29.841 --> 16:31.426
Okay.

16:31.427 --> 16:33.765
Nut-Face me is back on track.

16:33.766 --> 16:35.811
Give me the 20
on Tiger and Wolf.

16:38.818 --> 16:41.781
Either of you guys seen, uh,
"Weekend at Bernie's"?

16:49.338 --> 16:51.509
Sorry, Achilles.

16:51.510 --> 16:54.347
You sure you can
impersonate me?

16:54.348 --> 16:56.519
I don't know, you tell me.

16:56.520 --> 16:58.731
I did that for 20 years.

17:00.193 --> 17:01.779
I think I can drop it down

17:01.780 --> 17:04.117
a register and then feign
some deadness in my eyes.

17:04.118 --> 17:06.664
Come on, is that really
what I sound like?

17:06.665 --> 17:09.169
Yeah, it's pretty good.

17:16.350 --> 17:17.769
Oh, there you are.

17:17.770 --> 17:19.439
I got all--I got all
turned around.

17:19.440 --> 17:22.361
Um, could you escort me
to my, uh...

17:22.362 --> 17:24.073
Boyfriend.

17:24.074 --> 17:25.911
I've got eyes on RG1.

17:25.912 --> 17:28.290
Repeat, Real Girlfriend 1
is on her way.

17:28.291 --> 17:29.793
Yes!

17:29.794 --> 17:32.131
Okay, just moments away, folks!

17:32.132 --> 17:34.553
Moments away from boarding
the ships and journeying

17:34.554 --> 17:37.183
to a brave new world.

17:37.184 --> 17:38.770
Oh.

17:38.771 --> 17:41.191
My queen.

17:41.192 --> 17:43.696
That suit was designed
for your body,

17:43.697 --> 17:45.491
and your body is designing
that suit.

17:45.492 --> 17:47.203
Yeah, yeah.

17:47.204 --> 17:49.374
- Um, cool.
- What's wrong?

17:49.375 --> 17:51.002
You--you look like you're
about to throw up.

17:51.003 --> 17:53.841
I'm--no, it's just--
it's the excitement.

17:53.842 --> 17:56.012
It's just--it's all
the excitement.

17:56.013 --> 17:58.851
I just can't wait to be
in a place where we can

17:58.852 --> 18:02.149
touch each other, lover.

18:02.150 --> 18:03.736
Okay.

18:07.662 --> 18:09.665
Okay.

18:09.666 --> 18:12.336
Okay, we are in position.

18:12.337 --> 18:15.092
Yeah, the rest is up
to Nut-Face You.

18:15.093 --> 18:16.721
Yeah, yeah, don't--
he'll be good.

18:16.722 --> 18:19.183
I gave him a very,
very, uh, inspiring speech,

18:19.184 --> 18:21.438
so we're good.

18:21.439 --> 18:23.233
- Cool digs.
- All right!

18:23.234 --> 18:24.737
Jimmy, you're up!

18:24.738 --> 18:27.283
- See you on MARS!
- Not if I see you first.

18:27.284 --> 18:28.786
Love you, Stu.

18:31.334 --> 18:33.921
I got you.

18:44.360 --> 18:47.114
- What is taking so long?
- Don't worry.

18:47.115 --> 18:48.785
Nut-Face Me will come through
for us.

18:48.786 --> 18:51.665
Just gotta stay sharp.

19:04.609 --> 19:07.029
Okay, I know you too well.

19:07.030 --> 19:08.658
Something's up.

19:10.286 --> 19:11.622
Stop.

19:11.623 --> 19:13.876
Stop--stop the launch.

19:13.877 --> 19:16.089
I knew it.

19:16.090 --> 19:17.676
Your feet are not toasty.

19:17.677 --> 19:19.262
Okay, it's paused.

19:19.263 --> 19:21.725
- What's going on?
- Um, I...

19:21.726 --> 19:23.521
I just--I think that,

19:23.522 --> 19:25.608
you know, before we go through
with this, um--

19:25.609 --> 19:27.403
what about Ty-Anne?
I mean, we haven't talked

19:27.404 --> 19:29.073
about how you feel
leaving her behind.

19:29.074 --> 19:30.910
We should probably
get into that at great length,

19:30.911 --> 19:33.498
right now.

19:33.499 --> 19:35.085
Empathy.

19:35.086 --> 19:37.549
The ability to understand
and share in the emotions

19:37.550 --> 19:39.218
of another, yeah.

19:39.219 --> 19:41.097
- You have that.
- Yeah.

19:41.098 --> 19:42.559
Yeah.

19:42.560 --> 19:44.020
I'm--I'm fine.

19:44.021 --> 19:45.523
- Shall we continue?
- Hold on, hold on.

19:45.524 --> 19:47.694
I mean, what about all the--
the years

19:47.695 --> 19:49.030
you've spent together?

19:49.031 --> 19:52.537
Movie night or--
or breakfast for dinner.

19:52.538 --> 19:55.083
The home-school prom,
where I'm sure

19:55.084 --> 19:57.171
you were her date
and she was just

19:57.172 --> 19:58.508
so fine with that.

19:58.509 --> 20:00.720
You just gonna kind of
abandon her now?

20:00.721 --> 20:02.139
You were right.

20:02.140 --> 20:05.062
Everything I did
for the past 34 years,

20:05.063 --> 20:07.859
I--I did for her.

20:07.860 --> 20:11.784
And sure, I made some mistakes,
but I...

20:11.785 --> 20:14.121
I loved her.

20:14.122 --> 20:17.546
And I never thought I'd be
going through this without her.

20:20.553 --> 20:23.766
- Until we consummated our bond.
- Oh, hmm.

20:23.767 --> 20:25.895
Then I literally flipped
a switch, and Ty-Anne

20:25.896 --> 20:27.607
was dead to me.

20:27.608 --> 20:29.820
- That must have been hard.
- No.

20:29.821 --> 20:32.742
Easy as pi...
to the four-millionth decimal.

20:32.743 --> 20:34.663
It was always about you.

20:34.664 --> 20:36.625
She was a pale imitation.

20:36.626 --> 20:39.046
An experiment gone awry.

20:39.047 --> 20:41.217
- Was she, now?
- Yeah.

20:41.218 --> 20:43.138
And any paternal feelings
I had towards her

20:43.139 --> 20:45.727
have been permanently deleted.

20:45.728 --> 20:47.187
Good talk.

20:47.188 --> 20:49.735
Resume the launch!

20:49.736 --> 20:51.697
Well, then, I'm about
to tell you something

20:51.698 --> 20:53.491
that's gonna be
a pretty big disappointment.

20:53.492 --> 20:55.788
I'm gonna save your life,
I'm gonna save your life,

20:55.789 --> 20:58.001
I'm gonna save your life,
and your life,

20:58.002 --> 21:00.047
and your life.

21:00.048 --> 21:02.677
Unknown soldier coming through.

21:04.974 --> 21:06.309
Get behind me.

21:06.310 --> 21:09.190
I got you.

21:17.625 --> 21:19.586
Joosh.

21:22.342 --> 21:25.055
You know, we do have
a time machine.

21:25.056 --> 21:27.142
We could go
to Medieval Times.

21:27.143 --> 21:30.440
1986, Buena Park,
grand opening.

21:31.986 --> 21:33.279
Shit, we're up!

21:33.280 --> 21:35.450
Uh, ten, nine--
Go!

21:35.451 --> 21:38.081
Eight, seven, six,

21:38.082 --> 21:39.291
five...

21:39.292 --> 21:40.670
- Four...
- I'm in the middle!

21:40.671 --> 21:41.964
- I'm in the middle!
- Three, two--

21:41.965 --> 21:43.676
hit it, hit it!

21:43.677 --> 21:46.305
Ten, nine,

21:46.306 --> 21:48.393
eight, seven,

21:48.394 --> 21:50.648
six, five...

21:50.649 --> 21:53.194
Four, three,

21:53.195 --> 21:54.614
two, one.

21:54.615 --> 21:56.869
Come on,
hit it, hit it, hit it!

21:56.870 --> 21:59.123
- Cool lamp!
- Ten...

21:59.124 --> 22:01.962
Nine, eight,

22:01.963 --> 22:04.968
seven, six, five,

22:04.969 --> 22:07.473
four, three--

22:07.474 --> 22:09.143
hit it, hit it!

22:09.144 --> 22:10.813
- Cool lamp!
- Shit.

22:10.814 --> 22:12.316
Did we know
that was gonna happen?

22:12.317 --> 22:14.654
- Yeah, yeah.
- You saw "Time Climbers 3."

22:14.655 --> 22:15.740
- What?
- Oh, it's great.

22:15.741 --> 22:17.409
- Okay, go, go, go.
- Five...

22:17.410 --> 22:18.704
- Four...
- Four...

22:18.705 --> 22:20.248
- Three...
- Hit it, hit it!

22:20.249 --> 22:22.252
Two, one.

22:22.253 --> 22:24.841
Seven, six...

22:24.842 --> 22:26.469
Shit, did we know,
that was gonna happen?

22:26.470 --> 22:28.516
That's gonna get annoying.

22:28.517 --> 22:29.768
What's gonna happen
to all of them?

22:29.769 --> 22:31.187
Who cares?
They're not us.

22:31.188 --> 22:32.899
Three, two, one.

22:32.900 --> 22:35.403
Hit it, hit it!

22:39.287 --> 22:42.125
There's us's ahead of us!

22:42.126 --> 22:44.380
And behind us!

22:45.884 --> 22:49.014
- Why are we still running?
- Wait, yeah.

22:50.184 --> 22:51.770
- Two, one--
- Hang on a sec.

22:51.771 --> 22:53.314
If they get there first
then we'll still be

22:53.315 --> 22:55.695
in the hallway
when Stu comes back online.

22:55.696 --> 22:57.699
When those turrets
come back on,

22:57.700 --> 23:00.830
we do not want to be here.

23:00.831 --> 23:02.082
Can we go?

23:02.083 --> 23:04.713
- Do we have free will?
- Uh, I--

23:04.714 --> 23:06.550
- I think so?
- All right, well,

23:06.551 --> 23:09.138
let's just get the fuck out
of here.

23:09.139 --> 23:11.309
No, no, unless
the first group fails

23:11.310 --> 23:12.896
and we can make it
to the front and--

23:12.897 --> 23:14.273
and then they'll need someone
to take over,

23:14.274 --> 23:16.778
- and that should be us.
- What?

23:16.779 --> 23:18.616
- Fuck you guys.
- What in the shit?

23:18.617 --> 23:20.995
I swear to fuck.

23:20.996 --> 23:22.874
Why don't we just keep running
and jumping?

23:22.875 --> 23:24.084
I mean, won't we get there
eventually?

23:24.085 --> 23:27.299
I--I don't know.

23:27.300 --> 23:30.932
See you in 7734, suckers!

23:30.933 --> 23:32.810
Ten...

23:32.811 --> 23:34.856
Nine...

23:34.857 --> 23:36.902
eight...

23:36.903 --> 23:38.948
seven...

23:38.949 --> 23:40.576
six...

23:40.577 --> 23:42.412
five...

23:42.413 --> 23:44.709
four...

23:44.710 --> 23:46.880
three...

23:46.881 --> 23:48.592
Ten...

23:50.221 --> 23:51.932
The fuck?

23:54.522 --> 23:56.566
Okay, we gotta go.
We gotta go.

24:02.746 --> 24:04.289
Those doors
aren't gonna open!

24:04.290 --> 24:05.326
Yes, they will!

24:07.596 --> 24:08.966
We're out of time!

24:08.967 --> 24:11.638
- Power jump!
- Power jump!

24:19.697 --> 24:22.785
Hoo-ah!

24:29.884 --> 24:31.887
Joosh?
Wolf?

24:31.888 --> 24:34.099
Tiger.

24:34.100 --> 24:36.479
But if Tiger's in there...

24:36.480 --> 24:38.651
Hi, Dad.

24:44.329 --> 24:45.790
- Wow, did I underestimate you.
- Do you know how many times

24:45.791 --> 24:47.125
I wanted to quit?

24:47.126 --> 24:48.962
To kill myself?

24:48.963 --> 24:52.804
Do anything but stay with you?

24:52.805 --> 24:56.310
Suddenly it's all worth it.

24:56.311 --> 24:59.734
Um, that hurts.

24:59.735 --> 25:01.445
Tiger...

25:01.446 --> 25:03.491
- I thought you liked me.
- You took advantage of me

25:03.492 --> 25:05.161
when I was
emotionally vulnerable.

25:05.162 --> 25:07.625
How else was I gonna
get you to like me?

25:07.626 --> 25:09.253
No, no, no, no!

25:09.254 --> 25:11.298
- Wait, wait, wait!
- Stu, it's smasher code, okay?

25:11.299 --> 25:13.010
- Gotta do it.
- Everything I did

25:13.011 --> 25:14.681
I did for you, Tiger!

25:14.682 --> 25:16.977
- And for you, Ty-Anne.
- You're about to murder

25:16.978 --> 25:19.314
- all of humanity.
- Yeah, for you!

25:19.315 --> 25:20.985
Look, I--I know I lied.

25:20.986 --> 25:23.824
I--I know I'm gonna kill
millions of innocent people,

25:23.825 --> 25:26.245
but I am gonna save
so many more.

25:26.246 --> 25:28.499
It's called
a cost-benefit analysis.

25:28.500 --> 25:30.086
I ran the numbers.
Believe me,

25:30.087 --> 25:33.176
- they're on my side.
- Yeah, well, we're not.

25:33.177 --> 25:36.432
I thought humanity
was a weakness,

25:36.433 --> 25:38.019
and it turns out
that's the only thing

25:38.020 --> 25:39.606
that kept you fighting.

25:39.607 --> 25:42.945
God, everything you endured...

25:42.946 --> 25:45.200
all the odds you overcame,

25:45.201 --> 25:48.206
and you never gave up.

25:48.207 --> 25:51.755
None of you.

25:51.756 --> 25:54.051
My systems never could have
accounted for that.

25:56.515 --> 26:00.104
Because it's
fucking absurd!

26:00.105 --> 26:01.900
How did you do it?
How?

26:01.901 --> 26:05.406
You filthy shaved apes!

26:09.917 --> 26:13.047
We got the gist, right?

26:13.048 --> 26:14.968
No, no!

26:14.969 --> 26:16.805
No!

26:16.806 --> 26:19.101
Oh, no!
No!

26:31.418 --> 26:34.214
I died.

27:01.979 --> 27:03.439
- Okay.
- I mean, it's not as bad

27:03.440 --> 27:05.443
- as I expected.
- Yeah.

27:05.444 --> 27:07.405
A lot more dead yous
than dead us's.

27:07.406 --> 27:10.579
To be fair, a lot of them
are mutilated past the point

27:10.580 --> 27:12.541
of recognition, right?

27:12.542 --> 27:15.338
Oh, it's pathetic.

27:15.339 --> 27:18.010
- Wolf?
- What's wrong?

27:18.011 --> 27:19.764
Oh, so it's not so much fun
when it's a room full

27:19.765 --> 27:21.684
of dead yous, huh?

27:21.685 --> 27:24.022
Such a waste of talent.

27:26.152 --> 27:27.988
- Down on the ground.
- You have two seconds

27:27.989 --> 27:30.284
to comply starting...

27:30.285 --> 27:31.955
- now.
- Uh...

27:37.216 --> 27:38.677
- Who the hell are you people?
- You're under arrest

27:38.678 --> 27:41.223
for violating Statute HXB34

27:41.224 --> 27:43.269
of the Santa Clarita County
Time Code.

27:43.270 --> 27:45.983
Santa Clarita?
