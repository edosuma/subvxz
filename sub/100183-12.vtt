<i> Previously, on</i> 
"Black Lightning"...

00:02.068 --> 00:04.003
The Markovians
want to capture

00:04.091 --> 00:06.223
or kill as many metas
as possible.

00:06.286 --> 00:09.268
This occupation won't end until
they stabilize the meta gene itself.

00:09.355 --> 00:13.272
And once she does,
we will acquire that information

00:13.359 --> 00:17.510
and use it to stabilize
our own army of metas.

00:17.597 --> 00:19.345
They need Tobias
for the cure.

00:19.432 --> 00:20.546
I'll get him out.

00:20.633 --> 00:21.777
I'm with you.

00:21.865 --> 00:23.548
He should be
here by now.

00:23.636 --> 00:25.236
You're not that smart
after all.

00:26.306 --> 00:28.306
Always so damn tricky.

00:29.261 --> 00:30.519
Outstanding.

00:35.048 --> 00:36.829
<i>Speaking other language...</i>

00:36.916 --> 00:39.131
I'm rescinding the immunity
for the Pierce family.

00:39.218 --> 00:40.387
Kill the Pierces.

00:41.448 --> 00:42.529
Khalil?

00:42.617 --> 00:45.255
Jennifer Pierce,
you are a pain in the ass.

00:45.343 --> 00:46.730
Khalil, stop.

00:47.459 --> 00:48.740
Khalil, are you okay?

00:48.828 --> 00:50.176
He's still alive.

00:51.497 --> 00:52.979
- Who's Jen?
- That's me.

00:53.067 --> 00:54.152
He loves you.

01:18.691 --> 01:20.573
An old colleague of mine,

01:20.660 --> 01:23.342
Dr. Lynn Stewart,
will be arriving soon.

01:23.429 --> 01:25.011
<i>Colonel Mosin
wants her to create</i>

01:25.098 --> 01:28.180
<i>the meta stabilization cure

01:28.267 --> 01:31.017
<i>Unfortunately,
if Dr. Stewart is successful,</i>

01:31.104 --> 01:35.006
<i>my usefulness to Mosin
will vanish and I'll be...</i>

01:35.942 --> 01:36.942
<i>Dead.</i>

01:40.780 --> 01:42.929
But to keep things
light and cheery,

01:43.016 --> 01:45.031
and since Dr. Stewart
will be reluctant

01:45.118 --> 01:46.699
to share her formula,

01:46.786 --> 01:47.934
I'll be forced to engage

01:48.021 --> 01:51.237
in various bonding rituals
to gain her trust.

01:51.324 --> 01:54.140
<i>Human connection
is such a puzzling subject,</i>

01:54.227 --> 01:57.043
<i>so I did my research</i>

01:57.130 --> 01:59.797
<i>and I created

<i>Oh, correction.</i>

02:07.507 --> 02:09.822
<i>...Lynn and I</i>

02:09.908 --> 02:12.725
<i>are destined to be besties.</i>

02:12.812 --> 02:15.828
Bitch! I'm going to kill
you this time!

02:15.915 --> 02:17.897
You're the reason
they brought me here.

02:27.260 --> 02:29.226
I had nothing to do with it.

02:41.207 --> 02:44.824
You lying little bitch! - Surely
you can see I am also a prisoner here.

02:44.911 --> 02:46.325
I'm not on the
Markovian's side.

02:46.412 --> 02:48.027
In fact,
I've been trying to help you.

02:48.114 --> 02:48.928
Didn't you get my message?

02:49.015 --> 02:50.596
- Shut up.
- I knew it.

02:50.683 --> 02:53.199
Because of the data
I embedded in Cyclotronic,

02:53.286 --> 02:55.935
you were able to create
the meta stabilization formula.

02:56.022 --> 02:59.038
Your message contained a virus
that killed several metas.

02:59.125 --> 03:00.172
A minor oversight.

03:00.259 --> 03:02.108
You just remember
who you have to thank

03:02.195 --> 03:04.276
for creating the greatest
medical breakthrough

03:04.363 --> 03:05.945
in the history of mankind.

03:06.032 --> 03:07.013
Me!

03:07.100 --> 03:09.166
You are quite welcome,
Dr. Stewar...

03:09.868 --> 03:11.254
I mean Lynn.

03:18.909 --> 03:22.811
Dr. Stewart,
I am Colonel Yuri Mosin.

03:23.577 --> 03:25.159
I know that you have developed

03:25.247 --> 03:29.262
a meta stabilization
serum in America.

03:29.363 --> 03:31.637
Now that you are
a guest of Markovia,

03:31.724 --> 03:33.736
you will prepare it
for us here.

03:33.824 --> 03:35.315
I don't know what
you're talking about. There's...

03:38.131 --> 03:40.160
We both know
that you are lying,

03:40.248 --> 03:42.831
but that is to be expected

03:43.069 --> 03:45.955
from someone
who is a drug addict.

03:46.043 --> 03:47.219
What?

03:47.306 --> 03:51.308
I know that you have heard
horrible things about Markovians.

03:51.577 --> 03:56.465
But Odell is the devil
on this Earth.

03:56.848 --> 04:00.082
You think it was your idea
to try Green Light?

04:00.453 --> 04:03.223
Odell conditioned you.

04:03.689 --> 04:07.173
The ASA sprayed your wine
glass with Green Light

04:07.260 --> 04:10.443
and they put subliminal
messages on your tablet

04:10.530 --> 04:11.877
so that you would get hooked.

04:11.964 --> 04:13.496
You're lying!

04:14.333 --> 04:17.613
I had human intelligence
inside the ASA.

04:17.926 --> 04:20.103
Perhaps you know Nurse Allen.

04:23.457 --> 04:27.293
I need your brain
in optimum condition.

04:53.051 --> 04:54.238
Who the hell are you?

04:54.326 --> 04:56.322
And what do you mean he told you
he loves me? He's unconscious.

04:56.409 --> 04:58.135
I... I... I ta...

04:58.223 --> 05:00.911
- Spit it out!
- Easy, Jen. Easy.

05:01.647 --> 05:03.229
This is TC.

05:03.316 --> 05:05.873
He's a meta-human who can
communicate with machines.

05:05.961 --> 05:07.066
Khalil is not a machine.

05:07.153 --> 05:08.267
He kinda is.

05:08.354 --> 05:10.636
He does have a quantum chip
in his brain.

05:10.723 --> 05:11.757
Super advanced...

05:11.844 --> 05:13.381
If you don't watch what you
say, I'm really gonna...

05:13.468 --> 05:14.576
Jen.

05:15.361 --> 05:16.408
Relax.

05:16.495 --> 05:17.576
You all want to
give up on Khalil,

05:17.663 --> 05:19.145
but I'm telling you
he's still in there.

05:19.232 --> 05:20.613
We don't know that for sure.

05:20.700 --> 05:22.581
Your mother
thought the same thing.

05:22.668 --> 05:25.041
She's been trying to save Khalil
ever since we found him in the Pit.

05:25.128 --> 05:26.961
Hold up. Mom knew, too?

05:28.279 --> 05:29.655
So everybody in my family

05:29.742 --> 05:31.404
knew Khalil
was alive but me.

05:33.512 --> 05:34.860
Okay.

05:34.947 --> 05:37.163
So there's a chip in him.
Why don't we just take it out?

05:37.250 --> 05:39.014
You can't.

05:39.185 --> 05:41.634
The chip is connected
to Khalil's brain.

05:41.721 --> 05:43.254
Removing it would kill him.

05:48.045 --> 05:49.076
Come on, you look like

05:49.164 --> 05:50.357
you're about to pass out.
Let's go get some air.

05:50.444 --> 05:51.777
No, Anissa, leave me alone.

05:53.699 --> 05:56.115
If we can't remove the chip,
what else can we do?

05:56.202 --> 05:57.716
I'm not sure yet.

05:57.803 --> 06:00.951
It's like TC said,
the chip is a complex piece of technology.

06:01.817 --> 06:03.840
So TC is gonna need
to use his powers

06:03.928 --> 06:05.867
to go inside and see
what we're dealing with.

06:07.380 --> 06:09.404
Look, I'm sorry
I snapped at you, all right.

06:09.787 --> 06:11.630
My entire family
covered this up,

06:11.717 --> 06:13.357
so it's a lot to process.

06:14.147 --> 06:15.534
My bad
for almost lighting you up.

06:15.621 --> 06:16.982
Go ahead, do your thing.

06:38.514 --> 06:41.282
So now there are two outsiders
in the sanctum.

06:43.282 --> 06:45.123
Are you sure about this?

06:45.418 --> 06:47.769
I don't know much about
the kid with long hair,

06:47.857 --> 06:49.240
but TC's solid.

06:50.944 --> 06:53.436
You think TC's powers
can help Khalil?

06:54.627 --> 06:56.818
If Jen has to lose
that boy all over again...

06:56.906 --> 06:59.545
I think if anyone
can help him, he can.

07:08.092 --> 07:09.888
Your mother needs our help.
We gotta go.

07:09.975 --> 07:11.865
- What's wrong?
- I can't go into it now,

07:11.953 --> 07:13.436
we just gotta go.

07:21.020 --> 07:22.020
Lynn?

07:22.829 --> 07:24.261
Lynn, I got your message.

07:25.157 --> 07:26.316
Mom.

07:28.194 --> 07:29.511
Mom.

07:32.498 --> 07:33.931
I sent the message.

07:36.930 --> 07:38.830
My name
is Sergeant Gardner Grayle.

07:40.172 --> 07:42.539
Lynn's been kidnapped
by the Markovians.

07:47.660 --> 07:48.964
You did what?

07:49.067 --> 07:50.763
Now why would you break
Tobias out of the Pit?

07:50.850 --> 07:53.238
Lynn said it was the only way
to stop the ASA

07:53.326 --> 07:54.466
from weaponizing those kids.

07:54.553 --> 07:55.942
That's the craziest thing
I've ever heard.

07:56.029 --> 07:59.279
Look, I don't quite understand
the science mumbo jumbo,

07:59.367 --> 08:02.349
but there is a substance
that Tobias' body produces

08:02.437 --> 08:04.576
that is key to making
the stabilization serum.

08:04.664 --> 08:06.254
So you're saying,
without Tobias, there is...

08:06.341 --> 08:08.207
ASA's plan
is dead in the water.

08:08.510 --> 08:09.510
Hmm.

08:10.703 --> 08:12.318
And why should we trust you?

08:12.405 --> 08:14.171
You seem to be
playing both sides.

08:16.675 --> 08:18.308
I know who you both are.

08:19.111 --> 08:20.526
You're two powerful meta-humans

08:20.613 --> 08:23.514
that could squash me like a bug
without breaking a sweat.

08:24.417 --> 08:26.183
It's a huge risk
for me to be here.

08:27.253 --> 08:28.967
But that's how far
I'm willing to go

08:29.054 --> 08:31.321
to set things right
for Lynn,

08:32.057 --> 08:33.490
for all those kids,

08:34.293 --> 08:35.519
and for Freeland.

08:40.633 --> 08:42.198
Well, lucky for you,
Sergeant Grayle,

08:43.436 --> 08:45.335
I've always believed
in second chances.

08:47.072 --> 08:50.022
All right, look,
how do we get my mom back?

08:50.109 --> 08:52.958
Does the ASA know where the
Markovians are keeping Lynn?

08:53.045 --> 08:54.560
Major Grey
has the best people on it.

08:54.647 --> 08:57.029
Since Markovia has meta-humans,

08:57.116 --> 08:59.565
I expect Major Grey will want
Black Lightning's help

08:59.652 --> 09:01.834
in reacquiring Lynn.

09:01.921 --> 09:04.970
She will need to make
that request in person

09:05.057 --> 09:07.706
at a place
of Black Lightning's choosing.

09:07.794 --> 09:08.909
Understood.

09:09.925 --> 09:11.491
I'll see what I can do
to arrange it.

09:20.052 --> 09:21.417
I think it's a trap.

09:21.807 --> 09:22.839
Yup.

09:24.740 --> 09:26.073
Okay, look, Anissa...

09:30.404 --> 09:32.737
Something else you need to
know about your mom.

09:38.365 --> 09:41.394
I always say, you can't trust a big
lip, barrel chest, nappy headed,

09:41.527 --> 09:44.261
bug eyed, slue-footed negro
as far as you can throw him.

09:45.764 --> 09:46.862
You know...

09:49.662 --> 09:53.323
I can't stand
a self-hating black man.

09:58.844 --> 10:00.244
But then again,

10:01.326 --> 10:02.916
you ain't that black.

10:13.859 --> 10:15.558
You should just take the pill.

10:16.362 --> 10:18.143
How long since your last fix?

10:18.230 --> 10:19.596
It doesn't matter.

10:20.399 --> 10:21.706
Nothing does.

10:23.873 --> 10:26.138
You know what
would be nice, my friend?

10:26.226 --> 10:29.597
If before your withdrawal
symptoms begin to incapacitate you

10:29.685 --> 10:32.370
and you begin
drooling on the floor,

10:32.458 --> 10:35.559
would you be so kind
as to share the formula?

10:37.497 --> 10:39.456
You have something
to take notes?

10:42.954 --> 10:45.870
The formula is one cup flour...

10:48.411 --> 10:49.878
One egg...

10:51.409 --> 10:53.635
- Half cup of brown sugar.
- What is this?

11:00.573 --> 11:04.408
My aunt's peanut butter
cookie recipe.

11:05.945 --> 11:08.827
Whether I help you
with the formula or not,

11:08.914 --> 11:10.464
I'm dead either way.

11:11.584 --> 11:13.605
And I would rather die

11:14.020 --> 11:16.573
than help Mosin
weaponize those metas.

11:23.318 --> 11:25.237
Khalil,
I know you can hear me.

11:26.530 --> 11:28.972
Just hang in there,
okay? Please.

11:31.275 --> 11:32.753
You good?

11:37.476 --> 11:39.417
Before my mom died,

11:39.731 --> 11:42.855
I used to say goodbye to her
every single day

11:43.415 --> 11:45.862
because I didn't know
if that was gonna be her last.

11:49.659 --> 11:51.253
I know that was hard.

11:57.641 --> 11:59.789
This chip is bad, man.

11:59.985 --> 12:03.175
It's a hybrid of carbon nanotubes
and biological material.

12:03.263 --> 12:05.683
It's faster than anything
I've ever seen before.

12:09.675 --> 12:10.956
I've got it.

12:13.312 --> 12:14.784
Move aside.

12:16.301 --> 12:17.831
I've found
the root directory file

12:17.919 --> 12:20.206
for the Painkiller
operating system.

12:22.386 --> 12:24.069
Uncle Gambi,
can you translate, please?

12:24.156 --> 12:26.405
Think of Khalil's brain
like a computer

12:26.492 --> 12:28.840
and the Painkiller program
like the operating system

12:28.927 --> 12:30.242
that enables
the computer to function.

12:30.329 --> 12:31.533
Why don't we
just press the "off" button

12:31.620 --> 12:32.660
on the Painkiller program.

12:32.747 --> 12:35.463
That program is the only thing
running Khalil's cerebrum.

12:35.551 --> 12:38.633
It controls his memories,
language, emotion, reasoning.

12:38.843 --> 12:40.258
If we were to
shut it down now...

12:40.346 --> 12:41.737
Khalil would be brain dead.

12:43.342 --> 12:45.417
TC's trying to find
another option.

12:46.312 --> 12:48.808
I'm VRing into the chip
inside Khalil.

12:52.261 --> 12:53.861
It's a long, dark hallway.

12:55.421 --> 12:56.792
<i> Doors on each side.</i>

12:58.190 --> 12:59.933
<i>Like in an apartment.</i>

13:23.536 --> 13:24.815
Damn.

13:35.011 --> 13:36.230
The Painkiller system

13:36.318 --> 13:38.831
treated TC like a virus
and forced him out.

13:40.238 --> 13:42.787
I know where TC was
when he went in.

13:42.874 --> 13:45.081
It sounded like Khalil's
old apartment building.

13:46.671 --> 13:49.120
He must've gotten close
to the Khalil we know,

13:49.247 --> 13:51.162
otherwise the Painkiller system
wouldn't have been

13:51.249 --> 13:52.330
so bothered by the intrusion.

13:52.417 --> 13:54.065
Oh, God.
How do we get rid of him?

13:54.253 --> 13:55.612
Firewall.

13:57.756 --> 13:59.737
That's a good idea, kid.

14:00.358 --> 14:02.649
A firewall
would create a barrier

14:02.737 --> 14:05.636
between the Painkiller operating
system and Khalil's brain.

14:05.724 --> 14:07.445
But we'd still need a way
to push Painkiller

14:07.532 --> 14:09.698
behind the firewall
and trap him.

14:11.370 --> 14:12.745
Electric current.

14:20.111 --> 14:23.146
Man, I can't believe
Mom's been taking Green Light.

14:24.916 --> 14:28.099
She claims she removed
the addictive properties.

14:28.186 --> 14:29.919
Not based on
what I saw, though.

14:30.855 --> 14:32.622
When did you find all this out?

14:33.839 --> 14:35.362
I caught her taking it
right before

14:35.450 --> 14:38.394
we moved the kids from the
detainment center to Garfield.

14:38.894 --> 14:39.907
Wait, hold up.

14:39.995 --> 14:41.779
You discovered
Mom was taking drugs

14:41.866 --> 14:44.089
and you still
came with the Resistance?

14:44.378 --> 14:46.884
Dad, the Resistance would've
managed just fine without you.

14:46.971 --> 14:48.720
I just don't...
Your priority was to make sure

14:48.807 --> 14:50.054
that she was taken care of.

14:50.141 --> 14:52.857
Why did you not stay behind
and look after her?

14:52.944 --> 14:54.959
Henderson called me, told me
the kids were in trouble.

14:55.046 --> 14:56.861
Your mom stormed out.

14:56.948 --> 15:01.306
Look, Anissa, this... this thing
going on with your mom

15:01.394 --> 15:04.569
is not going to solve itself
in a moment, or a day.

15:04.656 --> 15:06.037
It's gonna take time to heal.

15:06.124 --> 15:09.640
I thought I had that time
to help her work through it

15:09.727 --> 15:10.975
and now this.

15:11.281 --> 15:13.782
It's not a thing, Dad.

15:15.480 --> 15:17.136
This is an illness.

15:18.476 --> 15:19.737
I know.

15:21.606 --> 15:23.026
I know.

15:24.843 --> 15:28.136
Why do you think this is your
problem to solve on your own?

15:28.292 --> 15:30.524
We'll deal with mom's addiction
together, okay?

15:30.612 --> 15:31.987
As a family.

15:33.112 --> 15:36.667
You know, in hindsight,
there were so many signs.

15:36.754 --> 15:38.436
I should have known...

15:38.585 --> 15:40.245
No, no, it's not your fault.

15:41.926 --> 15:43.659
But look...

15:44.362 --> 15:46.597
We gotta focus
on how to bring Mom back.

15:51.805 --> 15:53.073
Okay.

15:53.338 --> 15:54.720
Wait for my signal.

15:54.808 --> 15:56.230
Yeah, all right.

16:06.351 --> 16:07.714
Hey.

16:12.380 --> 16:14.446
Now, what the hell
are you doing here?

16:20.532 --> 16:21.898
Don't bother.

16:23.368 --> 16:24.800
I'll just beat it out of you.

16:27.877 --> 16:29.300
Now!

16:33.435 --> 16:34.808
Keep firing!

16:50.828 --> 16:52.175
Yeah.

17:03.350 --> 17:05.116
We got him behind the firewall!

17:12.617 --> 17:14.031
No!

17:14.117 --> 17:17.550
- Brains over brawn, bitch.

17:23.861 --> 17:26.544
We found looped security
footage of Tobias' cell

17:26.631 --> 17:29.448
and believe the Markovians
had someone inside the Pit.

17:30.535 --> 17:33.019
A male nurse
has conveniently gone MIA.

17:33.147 --> 17:34.947
Do you know
where Lynn's being held?

17:35.355 --> 17:36.598
Not yet.

17:36.686 --> 17:38.702
When you do,
let me know, I'll handle it.

17:38.855 --> 17:40.024
Meeting over.

17:40.111 --> 17:41.597
Hold on.

17:41.879 --> 17:44.980
There's no way you're going on
a mission to Markovia all alone.

17:45.199 --> 17:48.082
You might crush it with the
thugs on the streets of Freeland,

17:48.286 --> 17:50.964
but a foreign invasion
is way over your head.

17:51.456 --> 17:52.904
Well, yeah.

17:52.991 --> 17:55.367
Kind of especially against
a country full of metas.

17:55.455 --> 17:57.128
Listen to your daughter.

17:57.648 --> 17:59.043
We need to build
a team on this one.

17:59.130 --> 18:00.311
Whoa. Whoa. We?

18:00.398 --> 18:01.846
Oh, let me guess,

18:01.933 --> 18:04.015
you want some of your people
on this team.

18:04.102 --> 18:05.102
Of course.

18:05.516 --> 18:06.891
If we combine our resources,

18:06.979 --> 18:09.753
we stand the best chance of
bringing your wife back home

18:09.841 --> 18:11.222
and preventing
the Markovians from...

18:11.309 --> 18:13.758
Yeah, creating a meta army.
Yeah, yeah.

18:13.845 --> 18:15.760
After everything
the ASA has put me through,

18:15.847 --> 18:17.985
you have the nerve
to walk in this house,

18:18.102 --> 18:19.597
and suggest
that we work together?

18:19.684 --> 18:20.698
You must be crazy.

18:20.785 --> 18:22.352
Whoa, Dad.
Let's think about this.

18:22.520 --> 18:25.461
I can't hop on my motorcycle
and ride over to Markovia.

18:25.563 --> 18:27.238
It's way too far
for you to fly.

18:27.325 --> 18:29.006
We're gonna need
intel and communication.

18:29.141 --> 18:31.375
Let's think about this.

18:36.699 --> 18:37.977
Fine.

18:38.536 --> 18:39.985
One condition.

18:40.305 --> 18:45.390
Everyone I bring on this mission
is off-limits to the ASA forever.

18:45.478 --> 18:48.360
Their information
wiped from your files.

18:54.819 --> 18:56.133
Agreed.

19:06.759 --> 19:08.774
Shouldn't dude be
waking up or something?

19:09.789 --> 19:11.343
I don't know.

19:11.539 --> 19:15.446
TC said we should just wait,
see if his system reboots.

19:20.500 --> 19:22.563
Jennifer?

19:23.370 --> 19:24.891
I need to speak with you.

19:26.276 --> 19:27.485
Excuse me.

19:31.445 --> 19:33.008
Your mother...

19:36.273 --> 19:37.789
The Markovians...

19:39.813 --> 19:43.141
Kidnapped your mother
just outside the Pit.

19:45.731 --> 19:46.979
Where did they take her?

19:47.066 --> 19:50.133
We're narrowing in
on some possible locations.

19:50.688 --> 19:52.784
Anissa and I are putting
together an extraction team,

19:52.871 --> 19:54.936
so I'll keep you posted.

19:55.024 --> 19:56.858
Uh-uh. You don't
need to do that.

19:56.946 --> 19:57.891
You know
I'm coming with you.

19:57.979 --> 19:59.882
Jen, we have no idea
what we could be walking into...

19:59.969 --> 20:01.789
Which is why you need me.

20:02.063 --> 20:04.170
So I'm coming with you.
And so is he.

20:04.258 --> 20:05.914
- What?
- Coming where?

20:06.914 --> 20:08.139
Markovia.

20:08.227 --> 20:10.545
They kidnapped my mom
and that's where Jace is.

20:10.633 --> 20:14.047
Jen, I might be okay with you
coming, but... - I...

20:17.364 --> 20:19.532
Trust me, Dad, Brandon
can take care of himself.

20:19.856 --> 20:21.897
And he's got my back.

20:21.985 --> 20:24.816
Look, Mr. Pierce,
no disrespect,

20:25.196 --> 20:28.055
but I'm either going with you
or by myself.

20:28.860 --> 20:30.656
Dr. Jace killed my mom.

20:30.875 --> 20:33.305
So, if that's where she is,
then that's where I need to be.

20:37.352 --> 20:38.562
After everything
that's happened,

20:38.649 --> 20:40.098
how could you
possibly work with them?

20:40.185 --> 20:42.125
Because it's Lynn, Gambi.

20:43.537 --> 20:46.238
Because getting her back
is the only thing that matters.

20:48.569 --> 20:49.985
So, when do we leave?

20:52.030 --> 20:53.712
Well, actually,
I thought you could just

20:53.954 --> 20:55.781
monitor things from here.

20:55.969 --> 20:57.300
You're joking, right?

20:57.865 --> 20:59.272
You don't know Markovia.

20:59.360 --> 21:00.686
I've had business there.

21:00.774 --> 21:02.959
Believe me,
you're going to want me there.

21:03.047 --> 21:04.990
What... Business?

21:05.243 --> 21:08.102
<i>Speaking in Markovian...</i>

21:08.360 --> 21:10.477
I have many stories, my friend.

21:11.390 --> 21:13.399
Most of which
I'd rather forget.

21:15.111 --> 21:16.672
Pack a bag.

21:18.891 --> 21:20.672
This is
about my family.

21:20.760 --> 21:22.709
This is about my family.

21:22.797 --> 21:24.476
We have to
handle this on our own.

21:24.563 --> 21:26.712
Anissa, I'm not a child.

21:26.799 --> 21:29.548
Grace, sometimes you are.

21:29.688 --> 21:31.373
- Oh, low blow.
- I'm just saying.

21:31.461 --> 21:34.287
I've managed to survive
most people's worst nightmares.

21:34.375 --> 21:36.507
Besides, I'm pretty sure the
one and only time we fought,

21:36.594 --> 21:37.491
you got your ass kicked.

21:37.579 --> 21:39.558
Oh, woman, please.

21:39.688 --> 21:42.170
Please, do not get too far
ahead of yourself, okay?

21:42.258 --> 21:44.624
The last time we fought,
I didn't wanna beat down an old man.

21:44.711 --> 21:46.139
I didn't even use my powers.

21:46.227 --> 21:48.588
This conversation
is over and done.

21:48.676 --> 21:50.125
You're not going.

21:55.594 --> 21:57.881
Oh, what the hell
is wrong with you?

21:57.969 --> 21:59.967
No blood, no powers?

22:00.055 --> 22:02.414
Okay. You just make sure you
leave the leopard out of this.

22:02.501 --> 22:05.329
What, is Thunder afraid
of a little pussycat?

22:46.511 --> 22:48.461
- Huh?
- Yeah.

22:49.047 --> 22:50.313
Come on.

22:57.990 --> 23:02.329
Look, all I'm trying to say
is I love you

23:02.735 --> 23:04.507
and I would be devastated
if something were to

23:04.594 --> 23:06.264
happen to you because of me.

23:06.352 --> 23:07.679
This is my fight.

23:07.993 --> 23:09.998
Your fight is my fight,
babe.

23:10.086 --> 23:13.518
That's very nice of you to say,
but this is very dangerous.

23:13.782 --> 23:17.875
People might die and I don't...
I don't want that to be you.

23:20.016 --> 23:21.516
It won't be me.

23:22.763 --> 23:24.118
I'm going.

23:28.558 --> 23:29.781
Okay.

23:30.265 --> 23:32.015
And I thought you said,
"No powers."

23:33.789 --> 23:36.024
- Oh.
- Yeah, okay.

23:42.868 --> 23:46.532
Dr. Jace.
Why am I not surprised?

23:47.047 --> 23:50.121
I assure you, I'm every bit
the prisoner that you are.

23:50.422 --> 23:52.390
I'm merely doing
Dr. Stewart a favor

23:52.477 --> 23:54.359
and extracting
your bone marrow.

23:54.610 --> 23:57.529
Bitch, you've never done
anyone a favor in your life.

23:57.766 --> 23:59.264
You're merely a cockroach,

23:59.352 --> 24:01.022
doing whatever it takes
to survive.

24:01.110 --> 24:02.709
Well, I'd suggest
you do the same.

24:02.797 --> 24:04.502
What are they gonna do?

24:04.796 --> 24:06.303
If they want
stable metas around here,

24:06.391 --> 24:07.842
the Markovians
aren't going to touch

24:07.930 --> 24:10.039
a hair
on my chinny, chin, chin.

24:10.172 --> 24:12.811
This isn't Agent Odell and the ASA.

24:13.047 --> 24:15.480
No, but they do know my value.

24:15.664 --> 24:17.415
But you, on the other hand,

24:17.657 --> 24:19.751
now that Dr. Stewart is here,

24:20.000 --> 24:22.639
you're beginning to look
awfully expendable.

24:25.143 --> 24:28.561
Your arrogance is off the
charts as usual, Tobias.

24:28.649 --> 24:30.735
How safe you think you are.

24:31.735 --> 24:33.898
But because we're old friends,

24:33.986 --> 24:35.934
I'm gonna let you in
on a little secret.

24:36.021 --> 24:38.770
Colonel Mosin is making plans

24:39.091 --> 24:40.624
to lobotomize you.

24:50.631 --> 24:52.000
Vitals still good?

24:52.761 --> 24:53.891
Yes.

25:09.928 --> 25:11.407
The chip's working perfectly.

25:17.797 --> 25:19.625
Even her response time
has improved.

25:29.045 --> 25:30.922
Have you programmed
the kill order?

25:35.496 --> 25:38.602
I don't appreciate having to
give an order more than once.

25:39.574 --> 25:41.281
If we can't
reacquire this asset,

25:41.369 --> 25:43.402
we have to deny it
from the Markovians.

26:17.402 --> 26:18.969
Here, have a seat

26:19.057 --> 26:20.872
before you fall flat
on your ass.

26:20.960 --> 26:22.308
Careful, or someone
might mistake you

26:22.395 --> 26:23.766
for having compassion.

26:23.854 --> 26:25.867
No, I don't foresee
that being a problem.

26:27.707 --> 26:29.856
Actually, I prefer you
on the Glimmer.

26:29.983 --> 26:31.889
That obsessive need
for answers.

26:31.977 --> 26:33.433
It's not unlike
how I see the world.

26:33.609 --> 26:34.734
I am nothing like you.

26:34.822 --> 26:37.237
Honestly, you may be
the only person I've ever met

26:37.325 --> 26:38.524
as smart as me.

26:41.628 --> 26:43.194
I know I'm not...

26:44.086 --> 26:46.156
easy to work with,

26:46.630 --> 26:48.797
but I really am
trying to help you.

26:50.457 --> 26:51.805
All right.

26:54.154 --> 26:57.121
I need medication to help me
deal with withdrawal.

26:58.507 --> 27:01.055
My hands aren't
steady enough to finish it.

27:04.283 --> 27:06.098
Lynn, this is the formula
for methadone.

27:06.186 --> 27:08.152
It won't do anything
for a Green Light derivative.

27:08.240 --> 27:09.285
You're not thinking straight.

27:09.373 --> 27:10.281
No, you... you're wrong!

27:10.369 --> 27:12.017
You know I'm right.

27:12.244 --> 27:14.477
It's the Glimmer
or you'll probably die.

27:16.853 --> 27:19.031
I... I can't die in here.

27:50.622 --> 27:52.237
Any progress?

27:52.347 --> 27:54.414
I've successfully
earned her trust.

27:54.535 --> 27:58.453
Trust does not strengthen
my numbers, does it?

27:58.711 --> 28:00.055
Besides Gravedigger,

28:00.158 --> 28:02.844
how many metas are stable enough
to fight?

28:02.981 --> 28:04.289
None, I'm afraid.

28:04.594 --> 28:07.566
If they exceed
50 or 60 percent output,

28:07.653 --> 28:10.070
they'll experience
sudden death.

28:10.296 --> 28:13.705
I need
that stabilization serum.

28:13.910 --> 28:15.409
And you'll have it.

28:16.796 --> 28:18.076
Soon.

28:18.164 --> 28:19.648
I better,

28:20.086 --> 28:24.283
or else you'll end up being
the subject of the experiments,

28:24.370 --> 28:26.871
and not the doctor.

28:39.085 --> 28:40.711
Peter Esposito,

28:41.383 --> 28:43.422
AKA Peter Gambi,

28:45.200 --> 28:47.258
AKA The Tailor.

28:48.728 --> 28:50.977
You look pretty good
for a dead man.

28:51.252 --> 28:52.453
Thank you, Major.

28:57.270 --> 29:00.653
As agreed,
all members of my team

29:00.740 --> 29:03.189
will be removed
from the ASA system,

29:03.276 --> 29:05.591
and will receive
full pardons and/or immunity,

29:05.756 --> 29:08.223
including Gambi.

29:14.038 --> 29:16.220
All right, everyone,
I need your full attention.

29:16.542 --> 29:17.859
Gather around.

29:22.492 --> 29:24.709
As you know,
I've assembled you here for a reason.

29:24.797 --> 29:26.099
I didn't come here for you.

29:26.187 --> 29:27.947
Yeah, me neither.

29:28.034 --> 29:29.875
Nobody's here
for you, actually.

29:29.978 --> 29:32.529
- I don't like working with the ASA.
- Guys, guys.

29:32.617 --> 29:34.553
All right, that's enough.

29:34.640 --> 29:37.969
Listen up.
We're going on to foreign soil

29:38.176 --> 29:41.461
to engage a ruthless enemy
who knows we're coming.

29:41.714 --> 29:44.172
We're gonna be outnumbered
and outgunned,

29:44.538 --> 29:48.016
so the ASA support is our best
chance of getting in and out alive.

29:50.250 --> 29:51.883
Look, we got
a lot to do, all right?

29:52.185 --> 29:54.039
In a short time.

29:54.964 --> 29:56.764
So let's get to work.

30:03.640 --> 30:04.821
I thought you said

30:04.909 --> 30:06.756
once we locked Painkiller
behind the firewall,

30:06.844 --> 30:08.327
Khalil would gain back
control of his brain.

30:08.414 --> 30:10.129
In theory, he should have.

30:10.216 --> 30:12.131
It doesn't make sense.

30:12.218 --> 30:13.750
Even a machine
this sophisticated...

30:13.838 --> 30:16.133
- TC, he's not a machine.
- I know.

30:16.722 --> 30:19.004
But tech this advanced still
needs an operating system.

30:19.092 --> 30:21.523
What if Painkiller got out
from behind the firewall?

30:22.727 --> 30:23.986
Maybe it wasn't strong enough.

30:24.074 --> 30:26.484
That would explain why Khalil
hasn't regained consciousness.

30:26.572 --> 30:28.445
Why don't you go back in there
and find out?

30:29.328 --> 30:30.787
Whether it's Painkiller or not,

30:30.875 --> 30:33.137
we still need to
identify the problem, TC.

30:39.191 --> 30:40.652
All right, fine.

31:02.435 --> 31:03.435
You.

31:05.355 --> 31:06.754
You did this to me.

31:21.680 --> 31:22.869
Hello?

31:24.670 --> 31:26.002
Is anybody here?

31:35.234 --> 31:37.301
Oh. Hi.

31:37.922 --> 31:38.922
Hey.

31:39.472 --> 31:40.828
I know this looks weird,

31:40.916 --> 31:43.369
but I kind of, sort of
need you to come with me.

31:44.565 --> 31:45.994
How did you...

31:48.091 --> 31:49.873
It doesn't matter.

31:50.016 --> 31:51.330
I... I can't. I've tried.

31:51.418 --> 31:53.919
You... you actually can.
Um...

31:55.111 --> 31:58.088
If you want. Leave, that is.

32:02.161 --> 32:03.676
Look, man,
I don't know who you are,

32:03.763 --> 32:05.503
or how you got into my bedroom,
but if he finds us...

32:05.590 --> 32:07.767
Well. This actually isn't your...

32:09.101 --> 32:11.119
I mean, it's sort of,
kind of is...

32:11.437 --> 32:14.407
But it's sort of,
kind of not your bedroom.

32:14.495 --> 32:15.783
Then what is it?

32:17.383 --> 32:18.797
Tell me.

32:19.072 --> 32:21.798
It's a figurative construct
of your imagination,

32:22.220 --> 32:25.283
some type of projected memory
from your subconscious.

32:26.519 --> 32:28.377
Or more likely, I'm just dead.

32:31.200 --> 32:32.548
You should go.

32:38.231 --> 32:41.599
The Painkiller OS
isn't the problem.

32:43.169 --> 32:44.483
It's Khalil.

32:44.570 --> 32:46.318
He created this safe harbor

32:46.420 --> 32:49.069
inside of what he thinks
is his bedroom.

32:49.287 --> 32:50.620
Now he won't come out.

32:51.377 --> 32:52.391
But if he's in there,

32:52.478 --> 32:53.626
it'll at least
keep him alive, right?

32:53.713 --> 32:55.481
Unfortunately, no.

32:56.182 --> 32:58.182
Unless Khalil reclaims
control of his brain,

32:58.270 --> 32:59.732
his most basic body functions,

32:59.819 --> 33:01.734
including breathing,
will soon stop working.

33:01.821 --> 33:03.302
Okay, you know what?

33:03.389 --> 33:05.408
TC, you need to
go back in there, okay?

33:05.496 --> 33:06.572
Do whatever you have to.

33:06.659 --> 33:08.244
Tell him I'm here.
Tell him I love him.

33:08.332 --> 33:10.105
I don't care what you tell him,
just get him out here.

33:10.192 --> 33:12.504
Hey, hey, I've tried.

33:12.920 --> 33:16.336
But talking to people
isn't exactly my strong suit.

33:16.502 --> 33:18.074
Why can't Jen do it?

33:19.238 --> 33:21.177
She's already zapped the dude's
brain with electricity, right?

33:21.264 --> 33:22.693
Yes.
It's not that simple.

33:22.793 --> 33:26.191
For her to do this, she would have
to channel herself into pure energy.

33:26.279 --> 33:27.593
All I know is,

33:27.809 --> 33:30.426
I've seen her make bullets
go through her body.

33:32.089 --> 33:33.572
It sounded
like pure energy to me.

33:33.660 --> 33:34.965
Is that true, Jen?

33:35.053 --> 33:37.213
Have you learned to control
your powers to that extent?

33:37.363 --> 33:38.907
Yeah. If I concentrate.

33:38.995 --> 33:40.294
Then Brandon's right.

33:40.892 --> 33:41.918
As pure energy,

33:42.021 --> 33:44.004
you could become a current
directly into the chip.

33:44.196 --> 33:46.212
And I can guide
that current to Khalil.

33:46.299 --> 33:47.680
All right, cool, let's do it.

33:47.767 --> 33:49.548
Whoa, not so fast.
Not so fast, Jen.

33:49.635 --> 33:51.050
There's a...
There's a danger here.

33:51.137 --> 33:54.353
You see, TC's not actually in
there, he's just virtual.

33:54.440 --> 33:56.989
But if you become energy
and go inside,

33:57.076 --> 33:58.858
you're actually
inside Khalil's mind.

33:58.945 --> 34:00.567
And if he shuts down
with you in there...

34:00.655 --> 34:01.613
Then you're dead, too.

34:04.951 --> 34:06.199
It's too risky, Jen.

34:06.387 --> 34:08.754
I won't allow you to put yourself
into that kind of danger.

34:08.842 --> 34:11.242
- Look, Uncle Gambi...
- Listen to me, Jen.

34:12.545 --> 34:14.315
The realization
of the things he's done

34:14.404 --> 34:15.964
would depress anybody.

34:16.929 --> 34:18.362
He killed his own mother.

34:19.831 --> 34:20.935
What?

34:21.634 --> 34:23.458
Odell put that chip in his head

34:23.599 --> 34:25.781
and programmed him
to take out his own mom.

34:26.072 --> 34:27.485
So you're saying he's suicidal?

34:27.724 --> 34:29.221
He very well could be.

34:29.308 --> 34:31.422
Uncle Gambi, I know
you're worried about me

34:31.510 --> 34:33.726
and I appreciate it, but I can

34:34.029 --> 34:35.880
and I will take care of myself.

34:36.282 --> 34:38.581
If I see any sign
there's no hope, I'll get out.

34:39.871 --> 34:41.958
Khalil would do
the same thing for me.

34:56.931 --> 34:58.598
So, you're dead, too, huh?

34:59.872 --> 35:01.238
I'm not dead, Khalil.

35:02.403 --> 35:03.669
And neither are you.

35:05.678 --> 35:06.910
Not yet.

35:08.848 --> 35:12.779
But Tobias,
he ripped my spine out.

35:13.758 --> 35:16.466
Yeah,
I thought that killed you, too,

35:16.677 --> 35:18.522
but apparently,
the ASA saved you.

35:20.544 --> 35:22.232
Like they did
with my legs, huh?

35:22.846 --> 35:24.334
That's right.

35:24.619 --> 35:26.478
Except this time
they put a chip in your brain

35:26.566 --> 35:28.419
with some sort of
operating system.

35:31.137 --> 35:32.287
So...

35:34.073 --> 35:35.773
None of this is real.

35:36.246 --> 35:37.594
Look, Khalil.

35:37.974 --> 35:39.209
Khalil, look at me.

35:40.980 --> 35:42.446
All of this is real.

35:43.413 --> 35:44.760
Thing is...

35:45.177 --> 35:47.966
It may not seem like it,
but this place is a prison.

35:48.387 --> 35:51.943
If you don't come with me right
now, you will die.

35:52.158 --> 35:53.891
Maybe I'm supposed to.

35:56.062 --> 35:57.355
Did you ever think of that?

35:57.443 --> 35:58.951
I thought you had.

36:00.566 --> 36:02.222
Now that I know
you're still alive,

36:02.310 --> 36:04.334
I'm not sure my heart
could take losing you again.

36:06.438 --> 36:08.438
So, please.

36:10.376 --> 36:11.834
Take my hand.

36:12.845 --> 36:14.146
It's okay.

36:24.690 --> 36:25.896
Let's go.

36:29.933 --> 36:31.107
Come on.

36:41.514 --> 36:43.229
Come on. Come on,
come on, come on.

36:43.317 --> 36:44.883
It's okay. It's okay.

36:45.660 --> 36:47.727
Come on, go.

36:49.281 --> 36:52.185
It's okay. It's okay. Come on.

36:58.500 --> 37:00.662
<i>Where the hell do you think
you're going?</i>

37:03.393 --> 37:05.460
<i>Get your ass back over here.</i>

37:06.992 --> 37:09.240
Hey, if we stay here...

37:09.467 --> 37:11.582
Khalil, just come
with me, okay?

37:11.670 --> 37:12.718
Don't listen to him.

37:12.805 --> 37:14.154
Please!

37:19.821 --> 37:21.955
<i>Without me,
you're nothing but a victim.</i>

37:24.150 --> 37:26.177
<i>What, you want to get shot?</i>

37:26.429 --> 37:28.723
<i>Have your spine
ripped out again?</i>

37:38.353 --> 37:39.552
<i>You're soft.</i>

38:03.189 --> 38:05.787
- You're nothing without me.
- Uh-oh.

38:05.875 --> 38:07.208
Jen...

38:09.311 --> 38:11.388
Tell me that I didn't kill my...

38:11.497 --> 38:13.027
No, you didn't, Khalil.

38:13.115 --> 38:14.714
You didn't do
any of those things, okay?

38:14.802 --> 38:16.021
He did.

38:24.043 --> 38:25.991
He's me.

38:26.078 --> 38:28.127
Hey, it's now or never.

38:28.214 --> 38:30.865
Khalil, listen,
you gotta come with me.

38:31.588 --> 38:33.488
Khalil, just come
with me, please.

38:34.086 --> 38:35.544
<i>Don't do it.</i>

38:36.760 --> 38:38.685
You won't survive without me.

38:39.364 --> 38:40.635
Khalil,
listen to me!

38:40.723 --> 38:41.573
You know it.

38:41.660 --> 38:42.941
Khalil, please
don't make me go through

38:43.028 --> 38:44.786
losing you all over again!

38:46.790 --> 38:50.092
Khalil! Khalil,
you can't die in here.

38:52.108 --> 38:54.301
But it's time for you
to make a choice.

38:55.453 --> 38:56.953
Gotta make a choice.

39:10.885 --> 39:12.651
Hey!

39:14.260 --> 39:15.474
You always listen to her!

39:15.561 --> 39:17.142
Hey, come back!

39:17.229 --> 39:18.443
One step, then another.

39:18.530 --> 39:19.778
You got it. Come on. Come on.

39:38.317 --> 39:41.112
You should've just left
me there to die alone.

39:43.063 --> 39:44.144
Just relax.

39:44.232 --> 39:46.448
Remember not
to touch his bare skin, Jen.

39:46.625 --> 39:47.799
Especially his hands.

39:47.887 --> 39:51.203
The ASA elevated the toxin
levels in your bloodstream,

39:51.306 --> 39:54.656
essentially creating
a poison touch.

39:54.743 --> 39:56.892
This poison can be delivered
at varying increments,

39:56.980 --> 40:00.487
ranging from stun,
to paralysis, to death.

40:02.612 --> 40:03.792
How did I know this?

40:03.880 --> 40:05.964
It's because the ASA...

40:06.472 --> 40:08.220
They programmed you
with a database

40:08.347 --> 40:10.792
of knowledge, skills
and abilities.

40:10.880 --> 40:12.962
Not only fighting and weapons,

40:13.185 --> 40:17.236
but a bunch of random things like
anatomy, philosophy, biomechanics...

40:17.323 --> 40:20.657
Wait, wait, wait.
They... programmed me?

40:21.417 --> 40:22.741
What? Like a computer?

40:22.828 --> 40:26.063
They programmed a chip,
inside your brain.

40:27.589 --> 40:28.758
Can you get it out?

40:28.846 --> 40:30.055
Not without killing you.

40:30.143 --> 40:33.337
We have the Painkiller
operating system firewalled.

40:34.839 --> 40:37.370
For now... - But it's
always gonna be inside you.

40:41.814 --> 40:43.428
But it's okay, Khalil,

40:43.620 --> 40:45.821
- because together we...
- Stop it!

40:45.909 --> 40:48.190
Just stop. Please.

40:53.727 --> 40:54.793
Jen, we...

40:58.297 --> 40:59.888
We can't be together.

41:01.533 --> 41:04.368
I mean, there's a monster
inside of me. I'm...

41:05.637 --> 41:06.856
Khalil.

41:09.900 --> 41:11.661
I'm literally poison.
