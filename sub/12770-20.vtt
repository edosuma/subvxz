AND IF WE DO NEED YOU,
WE'LL COME GET YOU?

07:30.917 --> 07:32.208
(elevator bell dings)

07:32.250 --> 07:36.709
(indistinct conversations
continue)

07:36.750 --> 07:38.709
HOW ARE YOU FEELING?

07:38.750 --> 07:40.750
TIRED.

07:40.792 --> 07:42.041
HUGE.

07:42.083 --> 07:44.542
WELL, YOUR WEIGHT GAIN
IS RIGHT WHERE IT SHOULD BE

07:44.583 --> 07:46.083
FOR THE THIRD TRIMESTER.

07:46.125 --> 07:48.542
ANY PROBLEMS,
ANY G.I. OR G.U. COMPLAINTS?

07:48.583 --> 07:50.959
NO,
EVERYTHING FEELS NORMAL...

07:51.000 --> 07:53.083
WHICH JUST SEEMS CRUEL.

07:54.500 --> 07:55.667
SHOULD I...

07:55.709 --> 07:57.041
(sighs)

07:57.083 --> 07:58.500
IS THERE ANYTHING
I SHOULD BE DOING

07:58.542 --> 08:02.125
TO HELP MY BABY REACH
THE OPTIMAL BIRTH WEIGHT...

08:02.166 --> 08:03.375
FOR THE TRANSPLANTS?

08:03.417 --> 08:04.583
WELL, YOU'RE DOING IT.

08:04.625 --> 08:06.041
YOU'RE RESTING.
YOU'RE EATING RIGHT.

08:06.083 --> 08:07.750
IF YOU KEEP TAKING CARE
OF YOURSELF,

08:07.792 --> 08:12.166
THIS, UH, THIS BABY WILL BE
ABLE TO HELP A LOT OF OTHERS.

08:13.875 --> 08:16.125
AND WHEN IT'S TIME FOR ME
TO DELIVER?

08:16.166 --> 08:18.125
WELL, MY HOPE IS THAT YOU'LL
DELIVER NATURALLY AT TERM,

08:18.166 --> 08:21.041
BUT SOMETIMES WOMEN
CARRYING ANENCEPHALIC BABIES

08:21.083 --> 08:23.041
DON'T ALWAYS GET
THE SIGNAL FROM THEIR BODIES

08:23.083 --> 08:24.208
TO GO INTO LABOR.

08:24.250 --> 08:26.500
IF THAT HAPPENS,
I'LL INDUCE,

08:26.542 --> 08:27.709
ONCE THE BABY IS BORN,
I'LL--

08:27.750 --> 08:29.041
I'LL HAVE YOU SIGN
THE CONSENT FORMS,

08:29.083 --> 08:32.542
AND THEN THE TRANSPLANT TEAM
WILL TAKE OVER.

08:33.875 --> 08:36.959
EVERYBODY AT THE PRACTICE
IS LOOKING AT ME NOW, YOU KNOW?

08:37.000 --> 08:39.333
LIKE THEY'RE AFRAID TO
SAY ANYTHING TO THE CRAZY LADY

08:39.375 --> 08:41.583
WHO'S CARRYING A BABY
WITH NO BRAIN TO TERM.

08:41.625 --> 08:44.041
I'M SURE THEY ALL WANT
TO SUPPORT YOU.

08:44.083 --> 08:46.792
MAYBE IF YOU LET THEM KNOW
WHAT THE PLAN IS, THAT...

08:46.834 --> 08:48.583
NO.

08:48.625 --> 08:49.834
I JUST...

08:49.875 --> 08:53.208
I CAN'T HANDLE TALKING ABOUT
THIS WITH ANYONE BUT YOU.

08:54.583 --> 08:55.792
OKAY?

08:55.834 --> 08:58.041
OKAY.

09:06.709 --> 09:08.041
HEY.
HEY.

09:08.083 --> 09:10.000
THANK YOU FOR WATCHING HENRY.

09:10.041 --> 09:11.875
I-I REALLY APPRECIATE IT.

09:11.917 --> 09:13.166
YEAH, NO PROBLEM.
WAS HE FUSSY?

09:13.208 --> 09:14.792
NO, IT WAS FINE.

09:14.834 --> 09:17.083
(laughs) DID HE DO THAT THING
WHERE HE STRETCHES

09:17.125 --> 09:19.625
AND HE LOOKS LIKE
A RELAXED OLD MAN?

09:19.667 --> 09:22.083
YOU KNOW, HONESTLY,
I DIDN'T NOTICE.

09:22.125 --> 09:25.041
YOU DID... OFFER
TO WATCH HIM, SAM.

09:25.083 --> 09:26.709
YEAH.

09:26.750 --> 09:29.375
WELL, YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE IF IT
WAS JUST GONNA PISS YOU OFF.

09:29.417 --> 09:31.041
(keys jangle)

09:31.083 --> 09:33.000
SORRY FOR THE INCONVENIENCE.

09:35.041 --> 09:36.709
(sighs)

09:36.750 --> 09:39.875
YOU KNOW YOUR PARENTS ARE JUST
LOOKING OUT FOR YOU, RIGHT?

09:39.917 --> 09:42.625
BY FOLLOWING ME
EVERYWHERE I GO?

09:42.667 --> 09:44.041
THAT'S WHAT PARENTS
ARE SUPPOSED TO DO.

09:44.083 --> 09:46.041
ALL RIGHT.
YOUR EARS LOOK GOOD.

09:46.083 --> 09:47.583
YOUR GLANDS ARE OKAY.

09:47.625 --> 09:49.208
OPEN YOUR MOUTH
AND SAY "AHH."

09:49.250 --> 09:50.458
AHH.

09:50.500 --> 09:51.750
YOU'RE 10 YEARS OLD.

09:51.792 --> 09:54.709
THAT MEANS THEY GOT, LIKE,
EIGHT MORE YEARS TO HASSLE YOU.

09:56.583 --> 09:58.625
ALL RIGHT, NO FEVER,
NO SWELLING, NO REDNESS.

09:58.667 --> 10:00.917
IF I DIDN'T KNOW BETTER,
I WOULD THINK MAYBE

10:00.959 --> 10:03.417
SOMEBODY WANTS
TO DITCH SCHOOL TODAY.

10:03.458 --> 10:05.709
YOU GOT A BIG TEST
OR SOMETHING?

10:05.750 --> 10:06.917
HEY.

10:06.959 --> 10:09.041
YOU'VE BEEN COMING TO ME
SINCE YOU WERE 2 YEARS OLD.

10:09.083 --> 10:11.041
YOU KNOW YOU CAN
TELL ME ANYTHING.

10:14.333 --> 10:16.542
THEY WON'T LISTEN TO ME,
DR. FREEDMAN.

10:16.583 --> 10:18.875
I KEEP TELLING THEM,
BUT THEY DON'T BELIEVE ME.

10:18.917 --> 10:20.959
WHAT DON'T THEY BELIEVE?

10:22.625 --> 10:24.083
HEY.

10:24.125 --> 10:26.625
I CAN'T HELP YOU UNLESS YOU
TELL ME WHAT'S GOING ON.

10:28.333 --> 10:31.333
I'M A BOY.

10:39.917 --> 10:41.041
OF COURSE MELODY'S PARENTS
WON'T LISTEN.

10:41.083 --> 10:42.709
WHO WANTS TO HEAR THAT?

10:42.750 --> 10:44.041
LOOK, PARENTING AIN'T EASY,
ALL RIGHT? THAT'S THE JOB.

10:44.083 --> 10:46.166
IT'S--IT'S HOW YOU HANDLE IT
THAT'S THE ISSUE.

10:46.208 --> 10:48.125
WELL, DENYING MELODY'S FEELINGS
ISN'T THE ANSWER.

10:48.166 --> 10:49.792
I MEAN, SHE SAYS SHE'S ALWAYS
KNOWN SHE WAS A BOY.

10:49.834 --> 10:51.250
EVEN AS A TODDLER,
SHE FELT LIKE

10:51.291 --> 10:52.500
SHE WAS TRAPPED
IN A GIRL'S BODY.

10:52.542 --> 10:54.875
SHE USED TO LINE UP TO--
TO GO TO THE BOYS' BATHROOM.

10:54.917 --> 10:56.166
SHE WANTED TO PLAY
ON THE BOYS' SPORTS TEAMS.

10:56.208 --> 10:57.917
WELL, ISN'T THAT JUST
BEING A TOMBOY?

10:57.959 --> 10:59.500
COULD BE G.I.D.
(Amelia) SHE'S 10.

10:59.542 --> 11:01.417
YOU CAN'T DIAGNOSE GENDER
IDENTITY DISORDER IN A KID.

11:01.458 --> 11:03.959
HER PREFRONTAL CORTEX
ISN'T FULLY DEVELOPED.

11:04.000 --> 11:05.500
WELL, THAT DOESN'T MEAN
SHE DOESN'T KNOW HOW SHE FEELS.

11:05.542 --> 11:07.542
NO, BUT IT MIGHT MEAN SHE
DOESN'T REALLY UNDERSTAND IT.

11:07.583 --> 11:10.709
LOOK, WHEN MAYA WAS 8, SHE SAID
SHE WANTED TO BE A FIREMAN.

11:10.750 --> 11:12.333
SHE GREW OUT OF IT.

11:12.375 --> 11:14.000
AND MELODY PROBABLY WILL, TOO.

11:14.041 --> 11:16.000
AS SOON AS SHE HITS PUBERTY,
THE HORMONES WILL KICK IN,

11:16.041 --> 11:17.291
SHE'LL START TO DEVELOP,

11:17.333 --> 11:18.542
AND SHE'LL WANT TO BE
AROUND BOYS.

11:18.583 --> 11:19.792
SHE WON'T WANT TO BE ONE.

11:19.834 --> 11:21.083
WELL, IT'S A LITTLE BIT
MORE COMPLICATED THAN THAT.

11:21.125 --> 11:23.208
KIDS WITH G.I.D. EXPERIENCE
A DISCONNECT BETWEEN

11:23.250 --> 11:24.709
THEIR SEX, WHICH IS ANATOMY,
AND THEIR GENDER,

11:24.750 --> 11:26.583
WHICH IS EMOTIONS, BEHAVIORS,
AND EVERYTHING ELSE.

11:26.625 --> 11:28.125
AND THE LONGER THEY'RE FORCED
TO LIVE WITH THE WRONG GENDER,

11:28.166 --> 11:29.667
THE MORE DAMAGE IS DONE.

11:29.709 --> 11:31.125
AND THE SOONER THEY CAN
INTEGRATE THEIR EXTERNAL BODY

11:31.166 --> 11:33.375
WITH THEIR INTERNAL IMAGE
OF THEMSELVES,

11:33.417 --> 11:34.583
THE BETTER THEY DO.

11:34.625 --> 11:36.417
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT MELODY
DRESSING UP LIKE A BOY?

11:36.458 --> 11:37.959
FOR A START.

11:38.000 --> 11:39.959
WELL, IT'S ONE THING IF THEY
ALLOW HER TO DO THAT AT HOME,

11:40.000 --> 11:41.583
BUT ONCE SHE STEPS FOOT
IN SCHOOL,

11:41.625 --> 11:42.792
I MEAN, SHE'S GONNA
OPEN HERSELF UP TO RIDICULE,

11:42.834 --> 11:44.208
POSSIBLY BULLYING--

11:44.250 --> 11:45.458
OKAY, SO WE'RE SAYING
SHE'S SCREWED EITHER WAY?

11:45.500 --> 11:46.458
I MEAN,
SHE LIVES LIKE A BOY

11:46.500 --> 11:47.875
AND SHE RISKS GETTING

11:47.917 --> 11:49.041
THE CRAP KICKED OUT OF HER
AT SCHOOL EVERY DAY,

11:49.083 --> 11:50.667
OR SHE LIVES LIKE A GIRL
AND HAS TO FACE

11:50.709 --> 11:52.667
THE ANGST AND DEPRESSION OF
BEING CAUGHT IN THE WRONG BODY?

11:52.709 --> 11:54.166
(Violet) WELL, IT'S--
IT'S NOT JUST DEPRESSION.

11:54.208 --> 11:56.542
I MEAN, KIDS WITH TRUE G.I.D.
OFTEN HURT THEMSELVES.

11:56.583 --> 11:58.041
THEY CUT THEMSELVES,
THEY DO DRUGS,

11:58.083 --> 11:59.667
SUICIDE RATE IS FIVE TIMES
THE NATIONAL AVERAGE.

11:59.709 --> 12:03.375
OKAY, WELL, THAT MEANS...
YOU HAVE TO TALK TO HER

12:03.417 --> 12:05.208
AND MAKE A DIAGNOSIS.

12:05.250 --> 12:06.458
AND IF IT IS G.I.D.,

12:06.500 --> 12:07.834
WE NEED TO EXPLAIN IT
TO THE PARENTS.

12:07.875 --> 12:10.291
WELL, THAT'S ASSUMING
THEY'LL LISTEN.

12:10.333 --> 12:12.041
(Addison) WELL,

12:12.083 --> 12:13.625
I JUST CAN'T HELP THINKING

12:13.667 --> 12:16.041
THAT WHILE I AM OBSESSING OVER
WHETHER OR NOT MY NANNY

12:16.083 --> 12:17.625
CAN WORK LONGER HOURS,

12:17.667 --> 12:21.500
THIS MOTHER IS TRYING
TO KEEP HER KID ALIVE.

12:21.542 --> 12:24.375
YOU HAVE
RICH WHITE LADY GUILT.

12:24.417 --> 12:26.625
YES. NO.

12:26.667 --> 12:28.667
I--COME ON, VIOLET.
I HAVE A MIXED-RACE BABY.

12:28.709 --> 12:31.041
I ADOPTED HIM FROM A WOMAN
WITH LIMITED OPTIONS.

12:31.083 --> 12:32.458
IT'S NOT LIKE I DON'T GET IT.
I KNOW.

12:32.500 --> 12:34.041
BUT IT'S HARD.

12:34.083 --> 12:36.500
YOU HAVE $10,000 WORTH OF
BABY CLOTHES IN HENRY'S CLOSET,

12:36.542 --> 12:39.083
AND YOU HAVE NO WAY TO HELP THIS
WOMAN WHO'S ACTUALLY DESPERATE.

12:39.125 --> 12:41.041
(sighs) YES.

12:41.083 --> 12:42.667
AND YOU'RE
NOT COMFORTABLE INDUCING?

12:42.709 --> 12:44.041
I DON'T KNOW.

12:44.083 --> 12:45.542
IT'S NOT IDEAL, BUT I MEAN,

12:45.583 --> 12:47.542
THEN NEITHER IS BRINGING
THE BABY BACK TO EL SALVADOR.

12:47.583 --> 12:49.041
AND WHEN DID CHARLOTTE SAY
IMMIGRATION IS COMING?

12:49.083 --> 12:50.417
UH, THE NEXT 24 HOURS.

12:50.458 --> 12:51.875
OH, I'M SO SORRY.

12:51.917 --> 12:53.709
YEAH.

12:53.750 --> 12:57.417
WELL, YOU CAN ALWAYS TAKE
PETE'S STRATEGY

12:57.458 --> 12:59.041
AND DO NOTHING UNTIL
IT BLOWS UP IN YOUR FACE.

12:59.083 --> 13:00.333
WHAT BLEW UP IN YOUR FACE?

13:00.375 --> 13:01.542
NOTHING. NOTHING YET.

13:01.583 --> 13:03.542
NO, HE JUST WANTS TO, UH,
DO THE WHOLE,

13:03.583 --> 13:05.083
YOU KNOW,
"PUT DOWN THE BAGGAGE THING,"

13:05.125 --> 13:06.625
AND, UH, I AM WARY.

13:06.667 --> 13:08.875
OKAY, WHAT EXACTLY DOES THAT
MEAN, PUT DOWN THE BAGGAGE?

13:08.917 --> 13:11.041
IT MEANS HE WANTS TO GO
TO DINNER INSTEAD OF THERAPY.

13:11.083 --> 13:12.959
ARE THE TWO
MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE?

13:13.000 --> 13:14.917
TO HIM THEY ARE.

13:14.959 --> 13:16.458
I--LOOK, I...

13:16.500 --> 13:17.667
I DON'T FEEL LIKE
I CAN SAY NO.

13:17.709 --> 13:19.041
I DON'T EVEN WANT TO SAY NO,

13:19.083 --> 13:20.709
I JUST--I WANT US TO WORK,

13:20.750 --> 13:23.041
AND I DON'T THINK THAT WE CAN
GET THERE ON OUR OWN ANYMORE

13:23.083 --> 13:25.250
BUT... (sighs)

13:25.291 --> 13:28.583
BUT MAYBE I CAN USE THE DINNER
TO CONVINCE HIM TO...

13:28.625 --> 13:31.917
GO BACK TO THERAPY.

13:31.959 --> 13:34.291
(laughs)

13:34.333 --> 13:37.291
(people speaking indistinctly)

13:37.333 --> 13:38.750
(knocks on doorjamb)

13:38.792 --> 13:40.000
HEY, ANY CHANCE YOU COULD PICK
UP MASON AFTER SCHOOL TODAY?

13:40.041 --> 13:41.250
SURE.

13:41.291 --> 13:42.875
I HAVE THIS, UH, PATIENT--
MELODY, 10-YEAR-OLD GIRL

13:42.917 --> 13:44.166
WHO THINKS
SHE'S A LITTLE BOY.

13:44.208 --> 13:46.542
VIOLET AND I ARE GONNA GO OVER
AND TALK TO THE PARENTS.

13:46.583 --> 13:48.917
I CANNOT IMAGINE
DEALING WITH THAT AS A PARENT.

13:48.959 --> 13:50.583
YEAH, WELL, I WOULDN'T KNOW
ABOUT THAT.

13:50.625 --> 13:53.041
OH, COME ON, CHARLOTTE.
I APOLOGIZED FOR SAYING THAT.

13:53.083 --> 13:54.750
NO, YOU'VE BEEN TALKING TO ME
LIKE YOU'VE APOLOGIZED.

13:54.792 --> 13:56.417
YOU'VE BEEN SAYING
THE THINGS PEOPLE SAY

13:56.458 --> 13:57.625
AFTER THEY'VE APOLOGIZED.

13:57.667 --> 14:00.250
BUT THE ACTUAL APOLOGY,
I NEVER HEARD THAT.

14:00.291 --> 14:02.041
GOD, PLEASE DON'T DO THIS.

14:02.083 --> 14:03.291
MY SON
IS BARELY TALKING TO ME.

14:03.333 --> 14:04.625
HE DOESN'T LISTEN
TO A WORD I SAY.

14:04.667 --> 14:06.125
HE ONLY RESPONDS TO YOU.
I'M A LITTLE PISSED OFF.

14:06.166 --> 14:08.083
THERE'S ONLY CHILD
IN OUR FAMILY, COOPER.

14:08.125 --> 14:10.792
SO GROW UP
AND GET OVER IT.

14:12.041 --> 14:13.750
(sighs)

14:15.792 --> 14:18.166
(people speaking indistinctly)

14:18.208 --> 14:19.750
I'M WORRIED ABOUT AMELIA.

14:19.792 --> 14:21.542
SHE'S NOT SEEING ME
FOR PRENATAL CARE.

14:21.583 --> 14:23.542
I DON'T EVEN KNOW IF SHE'S
GETTING ANY MEDICAL ATTENTION--

14:23.583 --> 14:25.667
I'VE GOT IT COVERED.

14:25.709 --> 14:27.583
OH, SO YOU'RE HER O.B.?

14:27.625 --> 14:29.250
I'VE GOT IT COVERED,
ADDISON.

14:29.291 --> 14:30.792
THAT'S IT?

14:30.834 --> 14:32.750
YOU'RE NOT GONNA TELL ME
HOW SHE'S DOING PHYSICALLY,

14:32.792 --> 14:33.709
EMOTIONALLY--

14:33.750 --> 14:35.333
I AM NOT DISCUSSING THIS
WITH YOU.

14:35.375 --> 14:37.000
OKAY, LOOK, I RESPECT THAT.
I DO. I DO.

14:37.041 --> 14:38.542
I MEAN, AMELIA'S MADE IT
VERY CLEAR

14:38.583 --> 14:40.542
THAT SHE DOESN'T WANT MY HELP,
BUT I JUST--I LOVE HER,

14:40.583 --> 14:42.041
AND I-I WANT HER TO KNOW
THAT IF SHE NEEDS ME--

14:42.083 --> 14:44.583
IF YOU WANT TO TELL AMELIA
SOMETHING, TELL HER YOURSELF.

14:44.625 --> 14:46.000
I'M NOT GETTING
IN THE MIDDLE OF IT.

14:51.667 --> 14:54.417
(indistinct conversations)

14:54.458 --> 14:55.709
¿USTED HA VISITADO
A SANTA ANA?

14:55.750 --> 14:58.041
HACE MUCHOS ANOS.

14:58.083 --> 14:59.083
HEY.

14:59.125 --> 15:01.000
HEY.
HOW ARE YOU FEELING?

15:01.041 --> 15:04.041
FINE. BUT I'M RUNNING
OUT OF TIME.

15:04.083 --> 15:05.667
REINA WAS JUST TELLING ME ABOUT
THE VILLAGE WHERE SHE'S FROM.

15:05.709 --> 15:07.834
I HELPED SET UP A CLINIC
IN THAT AREA YEARS AGO.

15:07.875 --> 15:10.667
I KNOW THIS CLINIC,
BUT IT'S JUST A BUILDING NOW.

15:10.709 --> 15:12.625
WHEN I WAS LITTLE,
THE DOCTORS LEFT,

15:12.667 --> 15:14.875
AND IT WAS HARD FOR US
TO GET ANY MEDICINES.

15:14.917 --> 15:16.208
WAIT. WHAT?

15:16.250 --> 15:18.041
I SPENT A YEAR DOWN THERE.
WE MADE SO MUCH PROGRESS.

15:18.083 --> 15:19.625
BUT THE CRIME
AND THE POVERTY

15:19.667 --> 15:21.083
AND THE HURRICANES--

15:21.125 --> 15:23.625
YOU COULD NOT
DO ANYTHING ABOUT THAT.

15:23.667 --> 15:24.959
NO ONE CAN.

15:25.000 --> 15:26.667
IF I COULD MAKE A LIFE
FOR MY BABY AT HOME,

15:26.709 --> 15:28.500
I WOULD NOT HAVE COME HERE.

15:28.542 --> 15:30.041
BUT I CAN'T.

15:30.083 --> 15:31.417
NO, I KNOW, REINA,

15:31.458 --> 15:34.041
AND I CAN'T IMAGINE HOW HARD
THIS IS FOR YOU, TRULY.

15:34.083 --> 15:36.500
BUT I DO NEED YOU TO UNDERSTAND
THE RISKS YOUR BABY WOULD FACE

15:36.542 --> 15:37.709
IF YOU HAD HIM NOW.

15:37.750 --> 15:40.125
I DO. I PROMISE YOU.

15:40.166 --> 15:43.250
BUT I WANT YOU
TO UNDERSTAND THE RISK

15:43.291 --> 15:45.083
IF I DON'T HAVE HIM NOW.

15:56.458 --> 15:58.083
HEY.

15:58.125 --> 15:59.291
YOU ALL RIGHT?

15:59.333 --> 16:02.041
OOH. I AM TRYING SO HARD
NOT TO BE ANGRY RIGHT NOW.

16:02.083 --> 16:03.333
UH-OH. ADDISON?

16:03.375 --> 16:04.875
HUH. WHO ELSE?

16:04.917 --> 16:06.041
WHAT NOW?

16:06.083 --> 16:07.083
SHE DROPS BY THIS MORNING,

16:07.125 --> 16:08.959
ASKS ME IF I CAN
LOOK AFTER HENRY.

16:09.000 --> 16:10.041
REALLY?

16:10.083 --> 16:11.375
YEAH, MAN.

16:11.417 --> 16:13.583
I MEAN, SHE DIDN'T
"ASK ME" ASK ME,

16:13.625 --> 16:15.041
BUT, YOU KNOW,
THE NANNY WAS LATE,

16:15.083 --> 16:16.583
SHE COULDN'T FIND
ANYBODY ELSE TO COVER.

16:16.625 --> 16:18.750
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED
TO SAY, NO?

16:18.792 --> 16:20.709
IT'S JUST LIKE
WHEN YOU WERE TOGETHER.

16:20.750 --> 16:22.041
Y--

16:22.083 --> 16:23.583
THAT'S NOT FUNNY, MAN.

16:23.625 --> 16:25.750
I MEAN, I SHOULDN'T EVEN
BE AN OPTION, RIGHT?

16:25.792 --> 16:27.041
I'M THE EX.

16:27.083 --> 16:28.917
(sighs)

16:28.959 --> 16:30.083
THAT HENRY IS
A CUTE LITTLE BABY, THOUGH.

16:30.125 --> 16:32.542
AND WE CIRCLE BACK.

16:32.583 --> 16:35.333
YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU'RE RIGHT.

16:36.542 --> 16:37.709
SHE WANTED THAT BABY.

16:37.750 --> 16:40.041
SHE SHOULD HANDLE HIM
ON HER OWN.

16:40.083 --> 16:42.208
HEY... STOP TRYING
TO BE THE BAD GUY.

16:42.250 --> 16:44.583
IT'S NOT REALLY YOU.

16:52.083 --> 16:53.125
HEY.

16:53.166 --> 16:54.375
HEY.

16:54.417 --> 16:57.083
REINA REALLY PUT US
ON THE SPOT EARLIER, HUH?

16:57.125 --> 16:58.291
YEAH, WELL, I GET IT.

16:58.333 --> 17:00.375
YOU KNOW, SHE'S A MOTHER
ADVOCATING FOR HER CHILD.

17:00.417 --> 17:02.166
OH, IT'S SO FRUSTRATING.

17:02.208 --> 17:03.625
YOU KNOW, WE OPENED A CLINIC
NEAR WHERE REINA LIVED

17:03.667 --> 17:05.208
IN SANTA ANA.

17:05.250 --> 17:06.583
WE STAFFED IT,
WE TRAINED PEOPLE,

17:06.625 --> 17:08.166
AND IN A REGION THAT'S
THAT DEPRIVED,

17:08.208 --> 17:10.417
EVEN THE SLIGHTEST CHANGES
MAKE A HUGE DIFFERENCE.

17:10.458 --> 17:12.417
YOU KNOW, A LITTLE ACCESS
TO PREVENTATIVE CARE

17:12.458 --> 17:14.166
AND MEDICINE, IT'S...
I KNOW.

17:14.208 --> 17:17.041
I LEFT THERE THINKING THAT
THE PROBLEM WAS SOLVED.

17:17.083 --> 17:19.375
IS THERE ANY CHANCE THAT
REINA WOULD WANT TO STAY HERE,

17:19.417 --> 17:21.583
FIGHT THE DEPORTATION,
TRY TO MAKE A LIFE?

17:21.625 --> 17:23.041
I ASKED HER THAT.
SHE SAID SHE TRIED.

17:23.083 --> 17:24.375
SHE TRAVELED ALL THE WAY
UP THROUGH MEXICO,

17:24.417 --> 17:25.667
SHE SNUCK ACROSS THE BORDER,

17:25.709 --> 17:26.959
IMMEDIATELY APPLIED
FOR ASYLUM,

17:27.000 --> 17:28.208
BUT SHE LOST HER HEARING
AND HER APPEAL.

17:28.250 --> 17:29.667
SO SHE'S OUT OF OPTIONS.

17:29.709 --> 17:31.250
WHAT IF WE SPONSOR HER,

17:31.291 --> 17:33.542
AND DO WHATEVER IT TAKES,
GET HER A JOB?

17:33.583 --> 17:35.417
THAT'S NOT REALLY THE WAY
THE PROCESS WORKS.

17:35.458 --> 17:37.500
I JUST... I DON'T KNOW.

17:37.542 --> 17:39.625
IF I INDUCE HER, THEN I'M
GONNA FEEL RESPONSIBLE FOR

17:39.667 --> 17:41.625
A WOMAN LEAVING HER BABY.

17:41.667 --> 17:43.500
THIS IS NOT ON YOU,
ADDISON.

17:50.458 --> 17:51.834
PHYSICALLY,
MELODY IS FINE.

17:51.875 --> 17:53.041
SHE HAS NO INFECTIONS.

17:53.083 --> 17:54.083
HER BLOOD WORK CAME BACK
TOTALLY NORMAL.

17:54.125 --> 17:56.583
BUT EMOTIONALLY,
I AM A LITTLE CONCERNED,

17:56.625 --> 17:59.041
WHICH IS WHY I ASKED DR. TURNER
TO JOIN US.

17:59.083 --> 18:01.291
WE MAY HAVE NOTICED
SOME THINGS ABOUT YOUR DAUGHTER

18:01.333 --> 18:02.500
THAT MIGHT BE
A LITTLE CONCERNING

18:02.542 --> 18:03.792
OR HARD TO UNDERSTAND--

18:03.834 --> 18:05.291
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

18:05.333 --> 18:07.917
WE UNDERSTAND HER JUST FINE.

18:09.333 --> 18:12.041
WELL, MELODY FEELS LIKE
SHE'S A BOY

18:12.083 --> 18:13.750
TRAPPED IN A GIRL'S BODY.

18:13.792 --> 18:15.041
NOT THAT AGAIN.

18:15.083 --> 18:16.834
NO, MELODY'S
ALWAYS LOVED MAKE-BELIEVE.

18:16.875 --> 18:18.917
FROM THE TIME SHE WAS LITTLE,
SHE WOULD ALWAYS DO THESE PLAYS

18:18.959 --> 18:20.291
WHERE SHE WAS THE COWBOY,
THE COWGIRL, THE HORSE.

18:20.333 --> 18:22.291
SHE'D DRESS UP,
DO DIFFERENT VOICES.

18:22.333 --> 18:24.500
I'M NOT SURE
IF THIS IS MAKE-BELIEVE.

18:24.542 --> 18:27.250
SH-SHE MAY HAVE SOMETHING
CALLED G.I.D.--

18:27.291 --> 18:29.083
GENDER IDENTITY DISORDER.

18:29.125 --> 18:32.125
OR SHE'S JUST CONFUSED,
GOING THROUGH A STAGE.

18:32.166 --> 18:34.041
MAYBE. MAYBE.

18:34.083 --> 18:36.041
I-I WON'T REALLY KNOW UNTIL I
HAVE A CHANCE TO SPEAK WITH HER

18:36.083 --> 18:38.041
AND TO DO THAT,
I NEED YOUR PERMISSION.

18:38.083 --> 18:41.500
WELL, IF SHE DOES HAVE
THIS G.I.D...

18:41.542 --> 18:44.208
IS THERE ANYTHING
YOU CAN DO TO CURE IT?

18:44.250 --> 18:46.709
WELL, THAT WOULDN'T REALLY
BE OUR APPROACH TO THIS.

18:46.750 --> 18:50.542
THERAPY WOULD BE MORE ABOUT
HELPING MELODY ADJUST

18:50.583 --> 18:51.750
TO HER NEW REALITY.

18:51.792 --> 18:53.291
(Cooper)
AND IN ADDITION TO THERAPY,

18:53.333 --> 18:55.041
THERE ARE HORMONE-BLOCKING DRUGS
THAT COULD

18:55.083 --> 18:56.917
STAVE OFF PUBERTY FOR HER

18:56.959 --> 18:58.917
SO THAT SHE WOULD HAVE SOME TIME
TO DEAL WITH THESE ISSUES.

18:58.959 --> 19:00.250
WELL, DR. FREEDMAN, THAT--

19:00.291 --> 19:02.125
(Pam)
THIS IS A JOKE, RIGHT?

19:02.166 --> 19:04.375
YOU WANT US TO STOP
OUR DAUGHTER FROM GROWING UP

19:04.417 --> 19:06.166
BECAUSE SHE TOLD YOU
SOME RIDICULOUS STORY

19:06.208 --> 19:08.041
ABOUT BEING A BOY?
I KNOW THIS IS A LOT
TO TAKE IN.

19:08.083 --> 19:09.542
I WON'T LISTEN
TO ANY MORE OF THIS.

19:09.583 --> 19:13.333
YOU HAVE TO LEAVE
RIGHT NOW.

19:17.417 --> 19:19.583
AND STAY THE HELL AWAY
FROM OUR DAUGHTER.

NO, HE IS IN PAIN,
AND HE'S TAKING IT OUT ON YOU.

OKAY, CHARLOTTE, PLEASE DON'T
LECTURE ME ABOUT CHILDREN, OKAY?

21:25.542 --> 21:27.250

OTHER PEOPLE'S CHILDREN,
TEN MINUTES AT A TIME,

21:29.750 --> 21:31.291
WHEN THEY NEED YOUR HELP.

21:31.333 --> 21:34.125
THIS IS YOUR KID.
IT'S DIFFERENT.

21:34.166 --> 21:35.959
AND NOW YOU'RE THE EXPERT?

21:36.000 --> 21:38.375
I KNOW THAT SOMETIMES KIDS
CAN BE A ROYAL PAIN IN THE ASS

21:38.417 --> 21:41.041
AND IT'S THE JOB OF THE PARENT
TO LOVE THEM ANYWAY.

21:41.083 --> 21:43.750
YOU'RE NOT GONNA FIX MASON.

I'M FINE.

22:19.083 --> 22:21.291
HEY, PETE.
WHERE WERE YOU LAST NIGHT?

22:21.333 --> 22:22.792
YOU CUT OUT EARLY.

22:22.834 --> 22:24.041
DINNER.

22:24.083 --> 22:25.333
BUSINESS OR PLEASURE?

22:25.375 --> 22:26.709
UH, VIOLET.

22:26.750 --> 22:30.083
OH, SO, UH, YOU TWO
ARE DOING ALL RIGHT?

22:30.125 --> 22:31.291
I THINK WE'RE BETTER
THAN ALL RIGHT.

22:31.333 --> 22:33.041
I THINK MAYBE
WE'RE BACK.

22:33.083 --> 22:34.333
WHO'S BACK?

22:34.375 --> 22:35.333
PETE AND VIOLET.

22:35.375 --> 22:36.834
WHAT?
HOW'D THAT HAPPEN?

22:36.875 --> 22:39.583
LAST NIGHT WE WENT OUT
AND JUST...

22:41.083 --> 22:43.458
LOOK, THERE'S A TIME TO TALK
AND THERE'S A TIME TO...

22:43.500 --> 22:44.750
NOT TALK.

22:44.792 --> 22:46.333
ENOUGH SAID.

22:46.375 --> 22:48.125
YEAH, BUT THIS IS VIOLET,
THOUGH. SHE'S ALL ABOUT TALK.

22:48.166 --> 22:49.542
SOMETIMES.

22:49.583 --> 22:51.625
ALL RIGHT, LOOK, I'M--I'M NOT
ROOTING AGAINST YOU,

22:51.667 --> 22:54.041
AND I HOPE THAT YOU GET
EVERYTHING OUT OF THIS

22:54.083 --> 22:55.792
THAT YOU WANT,
BUT IN MY EXPERIENCE,

22:55.834 --> 22:57.792
YOU KNOW, YOU CAN USE SEX
TO GET BACK,

22:57.834 --> 23:00.041
BUT ONCE YOU'RE THERE, YOU END
UP HAVING THE SAME PROBLEMS

23:00.083 --> 23:01.458
YOU LEFT BEHIND
THE FIRST TIME.

23:01.500 --> 23:03.041
YOU'RE JUST BITTER
'CAUSE YOU WOUND UP

23:03.083 --> 23:04.041
WATCHING ADDISON'S BABY.

23:04.083 --> 23:06.041
WHAT? REALLY?

23:06.083 --> 23:07.125
I HAD NO CHOICE.

23:07.166 --> 23:08.625
LOOK,
YOU TWO ARE BIG BOYS,

23:08.667 --> 23:10.041
YOU CAN MAKE
YOUR OWN DECISIONS, BUT ME,

23:10.083 --> 23:13.208
I NEVER GO BACK
TO THE SAME WELL TWICE.

23:18.458 --> 23:21.458
(people speaking indistinctly)

23:25.917 --> 23:28.375
IMMIGRATION CAME
TO THE HOSPITAL FOR HER?

23:28.417 --> 23:30.583
THEY HAVE A REMOVAL ORDER
AND WANT TO TAKE HER RIGHT NOW.

23:30.625 --> 23:32.083
SAID THEY HAVE
THEIR OWN MEDICAL FACILITY

23:32.125 --> 23:33.375
AND CAN HANDLE EVERYTHING.

23:33.417 --> 23:34.583
CHARLOTTE--

23:34.625 --> 23:36.041
(lowered voice)
I AM REPEATING NOT AGREEING.

23:36.083 --> 23:37.458
(sighs)

23:37.500 --> 23:39.375
ADDISON, YOU KNOW THE OFFICIAL
POSITION OF THIS HOSPITAL

23:39.417 --> 23:40.875
IS THAT YOU CAN'T INDUCE
A WOMAN EARLY

23:40.917 --> 23:42.041
WITHOUT MEDICAL INDICATION.

23:42.083 --> 23:43.458
I KNOW. I KNOW.
WHAT'S YOUR POSITION?

23:43.500 --> 23:46.041
I THINK THAT NO MATTER
WHAT OUR LAWYERS,

23:46.083 --> 23:48.041
OR THOSE AGENTS,
OR ANYONE ELSE SAYS,

23:48.083 --> 23:49.333
YOU ARE HER DOCTOR.

23:49.375 --> 23:53.083
(woman speaking indistinctly
over p.a.)

23:55.333 --> 23:58.041
REINA, I'M GOING TO BREAK
YOUR WATER.

23:58.083 --> 24:00.583
AND THEN I'M GONNA PUT YOU
ON AN OXYTOCIN I.V.

24:00.625 --> 24:01.917
THAT WILL START YOUR LABOR.

24:01.959 --> 24:03.959
IT MAY TAKE A COUPLE OF HOURS,

24:04.000 --> 24:07.250
BUT BY THE END OF THE DAY,
YOUR SON WILL BE BORN.

24:07.291 --> 24:08.458
YOU READY?

24:08.500 --> 24:10.000
I'M READY.

24:14.333 --> 24:17.333
(people speaking indistinctly)

24:19.542 --> 24:22.458
HE KICKED.

24:22.500 --> 24:24.333
MY BABY, HE, UM, HE KICKED
LIKE ANY OTHER BABY,

24:24.375 --> 24:26.000
LIKE A NORMAL BABY.

24:26.041 --> 24:28.792
UH, MAYBE--MAYBE WE SHOULD
DO SOME MORE TESTS

24:28.834 --> 24:30.375
OR, UH,
A SECOND ULTRASOUND?

24:30.417 --> 24:33.041
WHY DON'T YOU, UH,
WHY DON'T YOU HAVE A SEAT?

24:33.083 --> 24:35.667
DON'T LOOK AT ME LIKE THAT.
I KNOW WHAT I FELT.

24:35.709 --> 24:37.333
MY BABY...

24:37.375 --> 24:38.792
(sighs)

24:40.291 --> 24:41.709
(exhales) OH, MY GOD.

24:41.750 --> 24:45.500
I AM A CRAZY PERSON.

24:47.375 --> 24:50.625
I'M A NEUROSURGEON.
I KNOW WHAT IS GOING ON.

24:52.083 --> 24:54.083
IT JUST FELT SO REAL.

24:54.125 --> 24:57.000
IT IS REAL.

24:57.041 --> 24:58.959
YOUR BABY IS REAL.

25:01.458 --> 25:03.500
I'VE BEEN FOCUSING SO HARD
ON THE END GOAL,

25:03.542 --> 25:05.041
I JUST--I HAVEN'T...

25:05.083 --> 25:10.709
STOPPED TO THINK ABOUT
WHAT IT WOULD BE LIKE...

25:10.750 --> 25:14.834
WHAT IT WOULD FEEL LIKE WHEN HE
STARTED MOVING INSIDE ME.

25:25.667 --> 25:27.583
DO YOU FEEL THAT?

25:29.250 --> 25:31.041
YES.

25:31.083 --> 25:32.458
I DO.

25:34.667 --> 25:37.792
THAT'S MY SON.

25:43.208 --> 25:45.166
HOW DID SHE GET HERE?

25:45.208 --> 25:46.417
SHE TOOK THE BUS.

25:46.458 --> 25:47.375
AND HER PARENTS?

25:47.417 --> 25:48.625
THEY THINK SHE'S AT SCHOOL.

25:48.667 --> 25:49.875
WE NEED TO CALL THEM.

25:49.917 --> 25:51.208
I KNOW.

25:53.083 --> 25:54.125
WHAT IF WE WAITED A LITTLE WHILE
BEFORE WE CALLED 'EM?

25:54.166 --> 25:55.417
COOPER.

25:55.458 --> 25:56.625
IT WOULD GIVE YOU A CHANCE
TO BE WITH MEL ALONE,

25:56.667 --> 25:58.208
MAKE A REAL DIAGNOSIS.

25:58.250 --> 25:59.500
I NEED
HER PARENTS' PERMISSION.

25:59.542 --> 26:00.542
WELL, YOU'RE NOT GONNA
GET IT, VIOLET.

26:00.583 --> 26:01.792
I MEAN, YOU WERE THERE.

26:01.834 --> 26:03.041
THEY WON'T BELIEVE US
OR HER.

26:03.083 --> 26:06.041
WELL, TALKING TO MELODY
BEHIND THEIR BACKS

26:06.083 --> 26:07.917
IS ONLY GONNA ADDRESS
HALF THE PROBLEM,

26:07.959 --> 26:09.375
AND IT MIGHT MAKE THINGS MORE
DIFFICULT FOR MELODY AT HOME.

26:09.417 --> 26:11.709
WELL, IT'S BETTER
THAN NOTHING.

26:11.750 --> 26:13.291
MELODY IS NOT MASON.

26:13.333 --> 26:15.000
WHAT IS THAT
SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

26:15.041 --> 26:16.583
I THINK YOU ARE FRUSTRATED
THAT YOU CAN'T HELP MASON

26:16.625 --> 26:18.041
WITH HIS GRIEVING,

26:18.083 --> 26:19.667
AND SO YOU'RE PUSHING TOO HARD
TO SAVE MELODY.

26:19.709 --> 26:21.625
COME ON.
HORMONE-BLOCKING DRUGS?

26:21.667 --> 26:23.417
IT'S A REAL OPTION.
IT'S WAY DOWN THE LINE,
COOPER,

26:23.458 --> 26:25.375
AND IT'S NOT
THE FIRST THING YOU SAY

26:25.417 --> 26:27.208
TO TWO TERRIFIED PARENTS
WHO ARE AFRAID TO ADMIT

26:27.250 --> 26:28.458
THAT THEIR DAUGHTER--

26:28.500 --> 26:29.667
OKAY, I GET THAT, VIOLET,
BUT THESE PEOPLE

26:29.709 --> 26:31.375
HAVE TURNED THEIR BACKS
ON THEIR DAUGHTER,

26:31.417 --> 26:33.458
AND THE MORE THEY IGNORE
HOW SHE FEELS,

26:33.500 --> 26:36.417
THE MORE
SHE'S GONNA WITHDRAW.

26:36.458 --> 26:38.291
WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING.

26:46.125 --> 26:47.667
MY MOM AND DAD WERE FIGHTING
ABOUT ME LAST NIGHT.

26:47.709 --> 26:50.291
HE SAID HE WANTED TO KNOW ABOUT
THE PILLS THAT COULD HELP ME.

26:50.333 --> 26:52.458
BUT SHE WOULDN'T LISTEN.

26:52.500 --> 26:54.875
THEN SHE STARTED YELLING.

26:54.917 --> 26:56.500
(sighs)

26:56.542 --> 26:59.667
SO IF I TAKE THE PILLS,

26:59.709 --> 27:01.375
WILL I BECOME A BOY?

27:01.417 --> 27:03.041
WELL, IT'S NOT
THAT SIMPLE, MEL.

27:03.083 --> 27:05.500
THE DRUGS WON'T TURN YOU
INTO ANYTHING.

27:05.542 --> 27:08.291
BUT THEY WILL STOP YOU
FROM MATURING INTO A WOMAN

27:08.333 --> 27:11.291
UNTIL YOU DECIDE
WHO YOU ARE.

27:11.333 --> 27:12.500
I KNOW WHO I AM.

27:12.542 --> 27:14.458
I-I KNOW YOU THINK YOU DO,

27:14.500 --> 27:16.875
BUT SOMETIMES,
THINGS CAN BE CONFUSING.

27:16.917 --> 27:18.959
I'M NOT CONFUSED.

27:19.000 --> 27:21.542
DURING THE DAY,
I HAVE TO BE A GIRL.

27:23.208 --> 27:24.458
BUT AT NIGHT,

27:24.500 --> 27:27.750
WHEN I CLOSE MY EYES
AND I DREAM...

27:29.500 --> 27:31.792
I'M A BOY...

27:31.834 --> 27:33.667
DOING BOY THINGS.

27:33.709 --> 27:35.709
(voice breaking)
AND THEN WHEN I WAKE UP,

27:35.750 --> 27:40.041
FOR A SECOND, I'M STILL A BOY.

27:40.083 --> 27:41.792
BUT THEN MY MOM COMES IN

27:41.834 --> 27:44.166
AND LAYS OUT CLOTHES
FOR THE DAY.

27:44.208 --> 27:47.125
IT'S USUALLY A DRESS
OR GLITTERY SHOES.

27:47.166 --> 27:50.166
IT'S ALWAYS THE SAME.

27:50.208 --> 27:52.375
I REFUSE TO WEAR IT,

27:52.417 --> 27:54.291
SHE GETS MAD,

27:54.333 --> 27:57.291
AND WE FIGHT,
AND I LOSE TV.

27:57.333 --> 28:02.041
SHE DOESN'T UNDERSTAND
HOW IT MAKES ME FEEL.

28:02.083 --> 28:04.333
HOW DOES IT MAKE YOU FEEL?

28:04.375 --> 28:06.417
WEARING GIRL CLOTHES,

28:06.458 --> 28:08.917
ACTING LIKE A GIRL
AT SCHOOL...

28:08.959 --> 28:10.625
(cries)

28:10.667 --> 28:12.375
I HATE IT.

28:12.417 --> 28:14.250
IT'S LIKE...

28:14.291 --> 28:18.458
I'M PRETENDING ALL THE TIME

28:18.500 --> 28:21.041
AND I CAN'T STOP.

28:21.083 --> 28:22.834
NO ONE WILL LET ME.

28:22.875 --> 28:25.875
(cries)

28:27.458 --> 28:29.583
IT'S OKAY TO CRY,
MELODY.

28:29.625 --> 28:32.542
EVEN BOYS CRY SOMETIMES.

28:32.583 --> 28:35.458
(sobs)

28:35.500 --> 28:38.041
(door opens)

28:38.083 --> 28:40.041
I'M SORRY.
ARE WE INTERRUPTING?

28:40.083 --> 28:41.834
UH, COULD YOU JUST
GIVE US A SECOND?

28:41.875 --> 28:44.792
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?

28:44.834 --> 28:47.041
NOTHING.
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?

28:47.083 --> 28:49.208
MY MOM DIED.

28:49.250 --> 28:52.333
I'M A BOY
AND NOBODY BELIEVES ME.

28:54.875 --> 28:56.417
YOU WANT TO COME PLAY?

29:09.250 --> 29:11.041
(indistinct conversations)

29:11.083 --> 29:12.667
(people speaking indistinctly)

29:12.709 --> 29:14.291
HEY.
DO YOU HAVE A SECOND?

29:14.333 --> 29:15.834
I HAVE A DELIVERY.
CAN IT WAIT?

29:15.875 --> 29:17.083
OH, YEAH, YEAH.
IT'S NOTHING REALLY.

29:17.125 --> 29:18.834
I JUST... YEAH, IT'S--
IT'S NOTHING.

29:18.875 --> 29:20.333
ALL RIGHT. OUT WITH IT.

29:20.375 --> 29:23.041
UH, I THINK PETE AND I,
WE DID A BAD THING.

29:23.083 --> 29:24.500
A BAD THING LIKE?

29:24.542 --> 29:25.458
WE HAD SEX.

29:25.500 --> 29:27.041
OOH,
THAT'S AN INTERESTING WAY

29:27.083 --> 29:29.041
OF CONVINCING HIM
TO GO BACK TO THERAPY.

29:29.083 --> 29:31.125
NO, I KNOW, BUT, YOU KNOW,
MAYBE IT'S A START.

29:31.166 --> 29:32.417
A START TOWARD?

29:32.458 --> 29:33.709
TRYING TO FIX THINGS
PETE'S WAY.

29:33.750 --> 29:35.917
ACTING FROM WHAT I FEEL
INSTEAD OF WHAT I THINK.

29:35.959 --> 29:37.041
CAN YOU DO THAT?

29:37.083 --> 29:38.208
I CAN TRY.

29:38.250 --> 29:39.417
SHOULD YOU DO THAT?

29:39.458 --> 29:41.041
MAYBE NOT. (chuckles)

29:41.083 --> 29:42.834
I DID SAY IT WAS A BAD THING,
DIDN'T I? (laughs)

29:42.875 --> 29:44.041
(laughs) OH.

29:44.083 --> 29:45.333
IT'S SO MUCH EASIER
TELLING OTHER PEOPLE

29:45.375 --> 29:47.333
WHAT TO DO
WITH THEIR LIVES.

29:47.375 --> 29:49.041
SHE'S DILATED,
PLUS-2 STATION.

29:49.083 --> 29:51.041
I JUST NEED A BIG PUSH.

29:51.083 --> 29:52.417
(groans) I'M TRYING.

29:52.458 --> 29:54.291
YOU'RE DOING GREAT.
JUST BEAR DOWN.

29:54.333 --> 29:55.542
COME ON.
(grunts)

29:55.583 --> 29:56.500
OKAY, I'VE GOT THE HEAD.
ALMOST THERE.

29:56.542 --> 29:57.959
(whimpers)

29:58.000 --> 30:00.083
(baby crying)
IS HE HERE?

30:00.125 --> 30:02.083
HE'S HERE.

30:02.125 --> 30:03.500
(continues crying)

30:03.542 --> 30:06.375
IS HE OKAY?
IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

30:06.417 --> 30:08.250
HE'S FINE.

30:08.291 --> 30:10.041
HE'S A HEALTHY,
BEAUTIFUL BOY.

30:10.083 --> 30:11.250
(crying)

30:11.291 --> 30:12.500
HE'S AMAZING.

30:12.542 --> 30:16.750
(continues crying)

30:16.792 --> 30:19.041
YOU WANT TO HOLD HIM?

30:19.083 --> 30:23.000
(continues crying)
FOR AS LONG AS I CAN.

30:23.041 --> 30:24.250
(fussing)

30:24.291 --> 30:28.041
(laughs)
TE QUIERO, CIELITO.

30:28.083 --> 30:30.417
(crying)

30:30.458 --> 30:31.917
(woman speaks indistinctly)

30:31.959 --> 30:33.417
EVERYTHING OKAY?

30:33.458 --> 30:35.291
GREAT.

30:35.333 --> 30:38.041
THE IMMIGRATION GUY
IS STILL HANGING AROUND?

30:38.083 --> 30:42.458
YOU DON'T FEEL LIKE SHE'S READY
TO BE MOVED YET, DO YOU?

30:45.583 --> 30:47.917
NOT TODAY.

30:47.959 --> 30:49.500
I'LL LET HIM KNOW.

30:49.542 --> 30:51.166
(people speak indistinctly)

30:51.208 --> 30:53.000
THANK YOU.

30:53.041 --> 30:54.542
I'M GONNA GIVE YOU TWO
SOME TIME.

30:54.583 --> 30:56.959
THANK YOU SO MUCH,
DR. MONTGOMERY.

30:59.083 --> 31:00.250
(laughs)

31:02.917 --> 31:04.667
(people speak indistinctly)

31:04.709 --> 31:06.458
REINA, ARE YOU SURE
YOU WANT TO LEAVE HIM HERE?

31:06.500 --> 31:07.750
I MEAN--

31:07.792 --> 31:09.041
AT HOME, I HAVE NO ONE.

31:09.083 --> 31:11.166
MY PARENTS ARE DEAD,

31:11.208 --> 31:13.542
AND MY BROTHER, HE LEFT HOME
A LONG TIME AGO.

31:13.583 --> 31:15.750
AND THE BABY'S FATHER IS...

31:15.792 --> 31:18.792
HE DISAPPEARED.

31:18.834 --> 31:21.375
IF I COULD GO BACK...

31:21.417 --> 31:23.750
I LOVE MY BABY, BUT...

31:23.792 --> 31:26.333
I WOULD DO MY LIFE
DIFFERENTLY.

31:26.375 --> 31:28.417
BUT THAT IS NOT POSSIBLE,

31:28.458 --> 31:32.041
SO... FOR ME,
NO LOOKING BACK.

31:32.083 --> 31:36.000
(cooing)

31:39.709 --> 31:42.291
(children laughing)

31:42.333 --> 31:46.000
(Mason and Melody
speaking indistinctly)

31:48.458 --> 31:49.834
HEY.

31:49.875 --> 31:51.041
(Melody laughs)

31:51.083 --> 31:52.250
YES!

31:52.291 --> 31:54.917
DOES MELODY KNOW
YOU CALLED HER PARENTS?

31:54.959 --> 31:56.834
I COULDN'T BRING MYSELF
TO TELL HER.

31:56.875 --> 31:58.083
COOPER.

31:58.125 --> 31:59.291
I DIDN'T WANT TO RISK
HER RUNNING AWAY AGAIN.

31:59.333 --> 32:01.542
NO! SO CLOSE.
(elevator bell dings)

32:01.583 --> 32:03.375
OKAY, SHOWTIME.

32:03.417 --> 32:05.250
A SECOND CHANCE.
FINE.

32:05.291 --> 32:06.709
(Pam) WE'RE HERE
TO SEE DR. FREEDMAN.

32:06.750 --> 32:08.041
(Cooper) HI.

32:08.083 --> 32:09.542
WHERE IS SHE?

32:09.583 --> 32:10.500
SHE'S, UH, PLAYING.

32:10.542 --> 32:11.750
SHE'S OKAY?

32:11.792 --> 32:13.291
SHE'S FINE. SHE'S FINE.

32:13.333 --> 32:15.041
GOOD, BECAUSE SHE AND I
ARE GONNA HAVE A LITTLE TALK.

32:15.083 --> 32:17.500
Y-YOU KNOW, YOU CANNOT
BERATE YOUR DAUGHTER INTO

32:17.542 --> 32:19.041
CHANGING HER MIND.

32:19.083 --> 32:20.333
THE ONLY THING YOU CAN DO
IS SUPPORT HER

32:20.375 --> 32:22.333
AND HELP HER NAVIGATE
THESE FEELINGS.

32:22.375 --> 32:23.875
SHE'S JUST A CHILD.

32:23.917 --> 32:25.125
WHO FEELS THAT SHE'S
TRAPPED IN THE WRONG BODY.

32:25.166 --> 32:26.625
AND I KNOW THAT SOUNDS
CRAZY TO YOU,

32:26.667 --> 32:28.333
BUT I HAVE SPOKEN TO HER,

32:28.375 --> 32:30.625
AND SHE--WELL, SHE CAME
TO US FOR HELP, AND I--

32:30.667 --> 32:32.458
AND I COULDN'T
NOT TALK TO HER.

32:32.500 --> 32:34.208
I JUST--I JUST COULDN'T.
BUT THE IMPORTANT THING IS,

32:34.250 --> 32:36.709
NOW I BELIEVE THAT--
THAT SHE'S NOT CONFUSED

32:36.750 --> 32:38.083
AND THAT
SHE'S NOT IMAGINING THIS.

32:38.125 --> 32:40.041
WELL, WHAT ARE WE
SUPPOSED TO DO?

32:40.083 --> 32:41.250
DON'T ENCOURAGE THEM
MICHAEL.

32:41.291 --> 32:42.959
WELL, WHAT IF THEY'RE RIGHT?

32:43.000 --> 32:44.250
WE NEED TO HELP HER.

32:44.291 --> 32:45.542
I DON'T HAVE TO LISTEN
TO THIS ANYMORE.

32:45.583 --> 32:47.041
WHERE IS SHE?

32:47.083 --> 32:49.959
SHE'S IN HERE.

32:53.041 --> 32:55.291
MEL.

32:55.333 --> 32:57.333
MELODY,
WE'RE GOING HOME.

32:57.375 --> 32:59.542
BUT I-I-I DON'T WANT TO.

32:59.583 --> 33:01.166
I DON'T CARE
WHAT YOU WANT.

33:01.208 --> 33:02.125
DON'T YELL AT HER.

33:02.166 --> 33:03.542
(Cooper) UH, MASE.

33:03.583 --> 33:04.792
WHO IS THIS?

33:04.834 --> 33:06.959
TH-THIS IS MY SON.
(Violet) AND HE'S RIGHT.

33:07.000 --> 33:09.834
NOTHING'S GONNA BE SOLVED
BY YELLING.

33:11.208 --> 33:12.458
DAD, DO SOMETHING.

33:12.500 --> 33:13.709
COME ON!

33:13.750 --> 33:15.000
PAM, PAM, PAM.

33:15.041 --> 33:16.500
OW!

33:16.542 --> 33:18.041
I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU'RE ANGRY
AND FRUSTRATED AND SCARED.

33:18.083 --> 33:20.083
MELODY IS NOT HAPPY, AND YOU
DON'T KNOW HOW TO HELP HER.

33:20.125 --> 33:21.792
BUT WE DO.
WE CAN HELP, OKAY?

33:21.834 --> 33:23.041
WE DON'T HAVE TO LISTEN
TO YOU.

33:23.083 --> 33:24.083
NO, YOU HAVE TO LISTEN
TO MELODY.

33:24.125 --> 33:25.750
(Cooper)
YOUR JOB IS TO PROTECT HER

33:25.792 --> 33:28.583
AND LOVE HER AND HELP HER,
NO MATTER WHAT.

33:28.625 --> 33:30.500
BUT FIRST...

33:30.542 --> 33:32.333
YOU HAVE TO TRY
TO UNDERSTAND HER.

33:32.375 --> 33:35.041
DON'T YOU TELL ME
HOW TO RAISE MY DAUGHTER.

33:35.083 --> 33:36.041
YOU'RE HURTING ME!

33:36.083 --> 33:37.291
PAM.

33:37.333 --> 33:41.083
(crying)

33:41.125 --> 33:43.583
(crying)
THIS IS MY LITTLE GIRL.

33:43.625 --> 33:46.000
DO YOU HEAR ME?
SHE'S MY LITTLE GIRL!

33:46.041 --> 33:48.333
(continues crying)

33:48.375 --> 33:50.583
DON'T CRY, MOMMY.

33:55.458 --> 33:57.458
YOU DON'T
HAVE TO DO THIS ALONE.

33:57.500 --> 34:00.875
WE CAN HELP YOU TWO UNDERSTAND
WHAT'S GOING ON WITH MELODY

34:00.917 --> 34:03.458
AND--AND HELP HER TRANSITION
TO BE THE PERSON

34:03.500 --> 34:04.834
THAT SHE IS INSIDE.

34:04.875 --> 34:08.125
(continues crying)

34:08.166 --> 34:09.792
SHE'S RIGHT.

34:09.834 --> 34:11.333
(sniffles)

34:11.375 --> 34:12.875
SHE'S RIGHT.

34:16.291 --> 34:19.041
(footsteps approach)

34:19.083 --> 34:22.208
VIOLET, OH, I HAVE
AN AMAZING IDEA.

34:22.250 --> 34:23.709
A-ACT-ACTUALLY, I--

34:23.750 --> 34:27.083
NO, NO, NO. REMEMBER THAT PLACE
IN CARMEL THAT YOU LOVE

34:27.125 --> 34:28.250
WITH THE CABINS?

34:28.291 --> 34:30.375
LET'S DRIVE UP THERE
WITH LUCAS THIS WEEKEND.

34:30.417 --> 34:32.208
JUST THE THREE OF US.
WE WOULD LOVE IT--

34:32.250 --> 34:34.417
PETE, NO, NO, PETE, PETE--
WE COULD SPEND
SOME TIME TOGETHER--

34:34.458 --> 34:36.291
NO, WE'RE--
WE'RE NOT GONNA DO THAT.

34:36.333 --> 34:39.375
I MEAN, WHAT WE'VE BEEN
TRYING TO DO HERE,

34:39.417 --> 34:41.417
THIS WHOLE
"PUT DOWN THE BAGGAGE

34:41.458 --> 34:43.625
AND HAVE FUN AND BE US AGAIN,"
IT'S--

34:43.667 --> 34:45.500
IT'S--IT'S SEDUCTIVE

34:45.542 --> 34:48.250
AND I CAN'T SAY
I HAVEN'T...

34:48.291 --> 34:49.458
I HAVEN'T LOVED IT.

34:49.500 --> 34:51.917
BUT GOING FORWARD,
IT'S NOT GONNA BE ENOUGH.

34:51.959 --> 34:55.291
YOU KNOW, HAVING SEX
AND TALKING ABOUT STARTING OVER,

34:55.333 --> 34:57.333
IT'S JUST NOT GONNA BE--
IT'S NOT GONNA FIX

34:57.375 --> 35:00.166
WHATEVER'S FUNDAMENTALLY
WRONG WITH OUR RELATIONSHIP.

35:00.208 --> 35:01.625
VIOLET, WHY DO WE HAVE TO
KEEP LOOKING BACK?

35:01.667 --> 35:03.542
CAN'T WE JUST DEAL WITH
THE NOW?

35:03.583 --> 35:06.417
BECAUSE WE DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT HAPPENED... PETE.

35:06.458 --> 35:09.417
WE--WE HAVE TO GO BACK
AND FIGURE THAT OUT.

35:09.458 --> 35:11.333
AND WE HAD JUST STARTED
TO SCRATCH THE SURFACE

35:11.375 --> 35:14.250
AND... (sighs)

35:14.291 --> 35:16.333
YOU NEED TO DO THE WORK.

35:16.375 --> 35:18.875
WE...

35:18.917 --> 35:22.667
WE NEED TO DO THE WORK.

35:28.583 --> 35:30.083
I THOUGHT YOU UNDERSTOOD.

35:30.125 --> 35:31.542
I DO. I DO UNDERSTAND.

35:31.583 --> 35:34.250
AND IF YOU WERE TO TELL ME THAT
YOU WANTED TO LEAVE YOUR BABY

35:34.291 --> 35:35.709
BECAUSE YOU WEREN'T EMOTIONALLY
PREPARED TO RAISE HIM,

35:35.750 --> 35:37.166
I WOULD BE THE FIRST ONE

35:37.208 --> 35:38.375
SAYING THAT YOU'RE DOING
THE RIGHT THING,

35:38.417 --> 35:40.041
BUT YOU DO WANT TO RAISE HIM.

35:40.083 --> 35:42.000
AND EVEN THOUGH I ADMIRE

35:42.041 --> 35:44.041
YOUR WILLINGNESS
TO SACRIFICE SO THAT

35:44.083 --> 35:45.250
HE HAS A BETTER CHANCE
AT LIFE THAN YOU HAD,

35:45.291 --> 35:48.041
I JUST--I FEEL LIKE
THERE HAS TO BE

35:48.083 --> 35:49.166
A BETTER WAY.

35:49.208 --> 35:50.375
THERE IS NO OTHER WAY.

35:50.417 --> 35:52.750
WHAT--WHAT IF YOU
WENT BACK TEMPORARILY,

35:52.792 --> 35:54.041
AND THEN YOU REAPPLIED FOR--

35:54.083 --> 35:56.333
IT WOULD TAKE YEARS
IF IT EVER HAPPENED.

35:56.375 --> 35:57.542
WHAT IF I WENT WITH YOU?

35:57.583 --> 35:59.125
WHAT? PETE.

35:59.166 --> 36:02.375
I--I'VE SPENT TIME THERE.
I KNOW MY WAY AROUND.

36:02.417 --> 36:05.417
I COULD HELP YOU AND THE BABY
GET SETTLED, MAKE A LIFE.

36:05.458 --> 36:06.792
IT WOULD...

36:06.834 --> 36:08.375
HOW COULD YOU DO THAT?

36:08.417 --> 36:10.375
YOU HAVE A FAMILY

36:10.417 --> 36:12.041
AND YOUR LIFE IS HERE.

36:13.792 --> 36:15.041
WELL, THERE'S NO OTHER WAY,
IS THERE?

36:24.583 --> 36:27.625
(knock on door)

36:37.250 --> 36:39.417
HI.
HEY.

36:39.458 --> 36:41.041
WHAT'S GOING ON?

36:41.083 --> 36:45.041
UM, I'M...

36:45.083 --> 36:47.166
I'M GONNA LEAVE
FOR A WHILE.

36:47.208 --> 36:49.375
WHAT?

36:49.417 --> 36:51.208
WH-WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

36:51.250 --> 36:53.792
EL SALVADOR. THERE'S A CLINIC
THERE I USED TO WORK--

36:53.834 --> 36:55.250
WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

36:55.291 --> 36:58.041
I WANT TO FIX IT.
I-I FEEL LIKE--

36:58.083 --> 37:00.875
YOU SHOULD FEEL LIKE YOU HAVE
SOMETHING TO FIX RIGHT HERE--

37:00.917 --> 37:03.667
US, OUR MARRIAGE.

37:03.709 --> 37:06.041
I'M STANDING
RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOU, PETE.

37:06.083 --> 37:08.166
YOUR SON IS SLEEPING
RIGHT UPSTAIRS.

37:08.208 --> 37:11.083
YOU CAN'T JUST RUN AWAY.

37:11.125 --> 37:14.041
PLEASE.

37:14.083 --> 37:16.333
PLEASE DO NOT DO THIS.

37:18.750 --> 37:22.041
(people speaking indistinctly)

37:22.083 --> 37:23.709
HEY, HEY, AMELIA.

37:23.750 --> 37:25.875
LOOK, I KNOW YOU HATE ME,

37:25.917 --> 37:27.875
BUT... THIS ISN'T THE END
OF THE ROAD FOR US.

37:27.917 --> 37:30.000
WE'RE FAMILY AND WE ALWAYS
WILL BE. I JUST...

37:30.041 --> 37:32.417
I JUST NEED YOU TO KNOW,
I THINK...

37:32.458 --> 37:34.041
YOU'RE AMAZING.

37:34.083 --> 37:35.417
YOU'RE STRONGER
THAN I COULD EVER BE.

37:35.458 --> 37:38.458
I DON'T KNOW HOW
YOU'RE GETTING THROUGH THIS.

37:38.500 --> 37:41.041
AND I'M HERE FOR YOU
FOR WHATEVER YOU NEED,

37:41.083 --> 37:44.208
EVEN IF WHAT YOU NEED
IS SOMEONE TO HATE.

37:44.250 --> 37:46.000
DR. MONTGOMERY,
WE NEED YOU RIGHT AWAY.

37:53.166 --> 37:54.709
WHAT HAPPENED?

37:54.750 --> 37:56.542
I CAME IN TO TAKE REINA
AND THE BABY BACK TO THE ROOM,

37:56.583 --> 37:57.834
BUT THEY WERE GONE.

37:57.875 --> 37:59.750
WE SEARCHED THE WHOLE WARD,
BUT...

37:59.792 --> 38:01.375
IF SHE CUT OFF THE TAGS
OR TRIED TO TAKE HIM OUT,

38:01.417 --> 38:02.834
THE ALARMS WOULD'VE SOUNDED,
AND THERE'S NOTHING.

38:02.875 --> 38:05.542
WELL, SHE'S NOT STEALING.
IT'S HER BABY.

38:05.583 --> 38:08.542
BUT SHE SHOULDN'T BE
LEAVING YET, SHOULD SHE?

38:08.583 --> 38:10.083
SHE'S THE MOTHER.

38:10.125 --> 38:12.291
IT'S HER CHOICE.

38:19.709 --> 38:21.041
(man speaks indistinctly on TV)

38:21.083 --> 38:22.750
(man) DOCTOR, QUINT'S MAP.

38:22.792 --> 38:24.125
HOW DID YOU
COME BY IT, LAD?

38:24.166 --> 38:26.750
WHY HE GAVE IT TO ME, SIR,
WHEN HE SENT ME FOR HELP.

38:26.792 --> 38:28.083
HE SAID THAT WE'D SHARE.

38:28.125 --> 38:30.125
(lock clicks)
SHARE WHAT?

38:30.166 --> 38:32.458
YOU DON'T KNOW?
PIRATE TREASURE, MAN.

38:32.500 --> 38:34.917
IT'S GOLD.

38:34.959 --> 38:36.875
(man speaking indistinctly)

38:36.917 --> 38:38.250
HEY, FELLAS.

38:38.291 --> 38:39.166
(Cooper) HEY.
HI.

38:39.208 --> 38:41.250
(speaks indistinctly)

38:41.291 --> 38:42.542
YOU WANT TO JOIN US?

38:42.583 --> 38:45.083
IT'S OKAY.
YOU TWO LOOK COMFORTABLE.

38:45.125 --> 38:46.667
COME ON. COME WATCH.

38:46.709 --> 38:48.166
(man speaking indistinctly)

38:48.208 --> 38:50.083
WELL, ALL RIGHT THEN.

38:50.125 --> 38:54.208
MASTER ROLAND,
YOU'RE A TRUMP, YOUNG HAWKINS.

38:54.250 --> 38:56.834
MARK MY WORDS,
YOU WILL SHARE.

38:56.875 --> 39:01.417
(man speaking indistinctly)

39:01.458 --> 39:04.500
(lowered voice)
I REALLY AM SORRY.

39:04.542 --> 39:06.208
I KNOW.

39:06.250 --> 39:09.250
(man speaking indistinctly)

39:13.208 --> 39:15.750
HEY, GUYS.
SORRY I'M A LITTLE LATE.

39:15.792 --> 39:19.166
HOPE I DIDN'T MISS BATH TIME.

39:19.208 --> 39:20.375
KEISHA?

39:20.417 --> 39:22.041
HENRY?

39:22.083 --> 39:24.041

39:24.083 --> 39:26.792

39:28.083 --> 39:31.834

39:33.500 --> 39:35.792
