24:41.606 --> 24:43.691
I've got
the whole day planned, okay?

24:43.691 --> 24:45.151
Oh, you're making the plans
today, are you?

24:45.151 --> 24:47.612
First, we're gonna look
at apartments.

24:47.612 --> 24:50.448
Then, the Kasselton Mall.

24:51.115 --> 24:52.491
Excuse you.

24:52.867 --> 24:55.912
Step three better be "Get to
school before homeroom bell."

24:55.912 --> 24:57.371
But Mom...

24:57.371 --> 24:59.582
Besides, I have errands
to run...

24:59.582 --> 25:01.292
Errands? What errands?

25:02.376 --> 25:04.128
Literally every errand.

25:04.128 --> 25:07.089
Your mama has to start feeling
like your mama again.

25:07.506 --> 25:11.219
I have to do groceries,
buy some clothes,

25:11.219 --> 25:14.847
fix my eyebrows, get a pedicure
if there's time.

25:14.847 --> 25:17.767
Come on, that's nothing.
I can get a pedicure with you.

25:17.767 --> 25:19.977
And then I have to be back
at the center at two thirty.

25:19.977 --> 25:22.313
I'm coming with you.
I'll do my homework in the car.

25:24.732 --> 25:26.901
I know you're worried about me
being alone.

25:26.901 --> 25:28.361
No, no, no.

25:29.487 --> 25:32.990
Mickey, look at me.

25:32.990 --> 25:34.867
I am fine.

25:34.867 --> 25:36.118
You know why?

25:37.245 --> 25:39.247
Because I get to be
with my son again.

27:03.289 --> 27:04.874
I miss him too.

27:13.341 --> 27:14.175
Look at me.

27:16.594 --> 27:21.140
This is the price we pay
when we love others...

27:21.140 --> 27:26.729
You get the wonder, the joy,
all the good times

27:26.729 --> 27:28.522
the memories
you'll never forget.

27:31.692 --> 27:33.986
But you get the tears
at the end, too.

27:36.614 --> 27:38.282
But he was worth it, right?

27:41.118 --> 27:42.411
Talk to me.

27:45.581 --> 27:49.919
No, you got enough
on your mind.

27:49.919 --> 27:51.754
No, sweetheart. I'm your mom.

27:51.754 --> 27:52.713
Talk to me.

27:57.259 --> 27:59.470
I feel so guilty.

27:59.470 --> 28:01.347
What are you talking about?

28:01.347 --> 28:05.601
If you and Dad hadn't moved
back to the States...

28:05.601 --> 28:07.061
No, Mickey.
You can't think like that.

28:07.061 --> 28:08.813
Life doesn't work that way.

28:08.813 --> 28:10.981
But we had this awesome life.

28:11.399 --> 28:12.775
We helped people...

28:12.775 --> 28:13.901
Yes, I know.

28:13.901 --> 28:16.070
And your dad and I made
a decision

28:16.070 --> 28:18.906
about what was best
for our family.

28:18.906 --> 28:21.075
And he wouldn't want you
to blame yourself.

28:23.536 --> 28:26.872
Yes, I know.

28:29.500 --> 28:30.960
Now get to class.

28:39.301 --> 28:40.845
Save your appetite.

28:40.845 --> 28:43.180
I'll have a surprise for you
when you get home.

28:43.848 --> 28:45.474
You're making sancocho?

28:46.142 --> 28:47.309
Of course!

28:47.309 --> 28:48.811
Yes! Wow!
