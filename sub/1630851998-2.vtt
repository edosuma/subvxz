WEBVTT

00:10.444 --> 00:13.914
- Everybody be dead,
if it wasn't for you.

00:15.416 --> 00:17.351
- This is a little outside
of what we do.

00:17.351 --> 00:18.486
- Thanks Mitch.

00:18.486 --> 00:19.887
- We're gonna need Kyle.

00:19.887 --> 00:21.855
- Your brothers are involved,
I'm sure.

00:21.855 --> 00:23.291
- What aren't they involved in?

00:23.291 --> 00:25.859
- Go straight to the office
and into the safe, yeah?

00:25.859 --> 00:28.829
- Two hundred grand
in the ground.

00:28.829 --> 00:31.299
- You owe me two dances.
- Okay.

00:35.269 --> 00:37.105
- Open the safe.

00:39.840 --> 00:42.776
- What happened?
- I need to talk to ya.

00:42.776 --> 00:44.878
- And who has the money?
- The police.

00:44.878 --> 00:47.881
- And that's going to be
a problem for you.

00:47.881 --> 00:50.017
- Son of a bitch, fuck off.

00:50.017 --> 00:51.819
Don't ever threaten me again.

00:52.120 --> 00:54.822
- Mitch, I know why he did it.

00:54.822 --> 00:56.390
But for the life of me,

00:56.390 --> 00:59.593
I'll never understand
why you do it.

00:59.593 --> 01:00.961
- I was hoping
you could help me

01:00.961 --> 01:03.864
with my daughter,
she's in real trouble.

01:03.864 --> 01:05.866
- What's her name?

02:20.841 --> 02:22.643
- Thank you.

02:24.945 --> 02:27.215
- So, is Mike
keeping the office?

02:27.215 --> 02:28.782
- Oh, probably.

02:28.782 --> 02:30.651
- Is he keeping, who's that,
that secretary,

02:30.651 --> 02:32.653
what was her name?
- Rebecca, you know her name.

02:32.653 --> 02:34.755
Jesus.
- Rebecca, oh, dios mio.

02:34.755 --> 02:36.457
- You know what dios mio means?

02:36.457 --> 02:40.093
- Yeah, oh my god, I think.

02:40.093 --> 02:42.863
- I remember when Jimmy
worked patrol and we were,

02:42.863 --> 02:44.832
we were busting a house
that were making

02:44.832 --> 02:46.367
Social Security cards
in the fruit streets.

02:46.367 --> 02:47.601
You remember that?

02:47.601 --> 02:49.837
- The Hondurans.
- The Hondurans.

02:49.837 --> 02:51.572
And I'm reading rights
to these guys

02:51.572 --> 02:54.208
and every fucking time
I finished a sentence,

02:54.208 --> 02:56.677
they all look over at Jimmy.

02:56.677 --> 02:58.779
And finally the captain says
Jimmy, just explain it to 'em.

02:58.779 --> 03:00.448
Please, they don't understand.

03:00.448 --> 03:01.782
Jimmy, yes sir.

03:01.782 --> 03:04.618
Real loud.
Real slow.

03:04.618 --> 03:09.056
You, have, the right,

03:09.056 --> 03:11.525
to remain, silent.

03:11.525 --> 03:12.793
- They all turned
their fucking heads

03:12.793 --> 03:14.428
and look at you at you
at the same fucking time.

03:20.668 --> 03:24.538
Kyle, I'm sorry, man.

03:24.538 --> 03:26.340
- Hey what,
you expect me to believe

03:26.340 --> 03:29.743
everyone's talking about
what a great guy Mitch was?

03:29.743 --> 03:32.780
Naw, they're talking about their
fucking mortgage rate,

03:32.780 --> 03:34.748
when Kingstown's gonna get
a country club.

03:34.748 --> 03:36.750
- Everybody misses everybody.
Everybody.

03:36.750 --> 03:39.720
I mean, how many of these
fucking things we been to?

03:39.720 --> 03:42.590
This isn't where you miss a guy.

03:42.590 --> 03:44.492
You gotta do it on your own.

03:44.492 --> 03:46.594
- Yeah.

03:48.896 --> 03:51.899
- Hey Mike.
- Hey fellas.

03:53.534 --> 03:56.770
- You gonna keep it going?
- I don't know.

03:56.770 --> 04:00.374
Ah, gotta tie up
some loose ends either way.

04:00.374 --> 04:01.909
May as well get started.

04:01.909 --> 04:04.978
- God, I've known him
since I was uh,

04:04.978 --> 04:07.481
shit, we went to
grade school together.

04:07.481 --> 04:10.884
- Hmm.
- I'm real sorry, Mike.

04:11.552 --> 04:12.620
I'm real sorry.

04:12.620 --> 04:14.855
- Everything about this
is sorry.

04:14.855 --> 04:17.858
Let's go on the porch.
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

04:27.635 --> 04:30.103
- All right,
so what the fuck happened?

04:30.103 --> 04:34.408
- Uh, Sam's story is
the guy attacked him.

04:34.408 --> 04:38.712
I mean, Sam's face is a wreck,
so maybe it's true.

04:38.712 --> 04:41.815
Guy's on a ventilator,
it was a whole team effort.

04:41.815 --> 04:44.718
Whole place was on lockdown
for, for fuckin' ever.

04:44.718 --> 04:46.820
The world won't miss
that piece of shit, okay?

04:46.820 --> 04:48.489
- Yeah, well,
the Crips are gonna miss him.

04:48.489 --> 04:49.723
- I don't know what to say,

04:49.723 --> 04:52.926
he's not my nephew,
I just tried to help out.

04:52.926 --> 04:55.696
- They're gonna play
that letter, Ed.

04:55.696 --> 04:57.665
They're gonna
fucking play the letter.

04:57.665 --> 04:59.600
If they don't try to hit him
on the outside.

04:59.600 --> 05:02.770
- Yeah, well, uh...

05:02.770 --> 05:05.773
Let 'em know at this point,

05:05.773 --> 05:08.709
however far they wanna take it,
we'll take it further.

05:08.709 --> 05:10.511
It may not be wise,
but Sam handled himself

05:10.511 --> 05:12.045
like a fucking man.
- No, it's not.

05:12.045 --> 05:13.647
Leave the gangster shit
to the gangsters, okay?

05:13.647 --> 05:15.349
They're not trying to
pull pensions,

05:15.349 --> 05:16.584
or put kids through college.

05:16.584 --> 05:18.686
- Well, what do you want us
to do, Mike?

05:18.686 --> 05:21.254
Ask our union rep
if we can have some hush money

05:21.254 --> 05:23.824
from the memorial fund?
- No, you're gonna be smart, Ed.

05:23.824 --> 05:26.594
Move some chess pieces around,
all right?

05:26.594 --> 05:28.195
Quinton still running C-block?
- Yep.

05:28.195 --> 05:30.831
- Who's got B?
- Uh, two brothers.

05:30.831 --> 05:33.266
It's a Lawrence
and a T-dog or some shit.

05:33.266 --> 05:34.402
- Fine, separate 'em.

05:34.402 --> 05:35.569
- P-dawg.
- Who cares?

05:35.569 --> 05:37.838
Transfer the weaker one,
put him in AdSeg.

05:37.838 --> 05:39.206
- You think that'll
make things better?

05:39.206 --> 05:42.843
- Well, with new leaders
slinging in the yard, right?

05:42.843 --> 05:44.678
Bloods will see an opportunity.

05:44.678 --> 05:46.680
And they'll tie
with the Mexicans.

05:46.680 --> 05:47.981
Crips might lose the yard.

05:47.981 --> 05:49.417
- Mm, Mitch wouldn't do it
that way, Mike.

05:49.417 --> 05:50.718
It's a big fucking risk.

05:50.718 --> 05:52.586
- Might be short-sighted,
but there is no risk.

05:52.586 --> 05:54.187
We got no choice, okay?

05:54.187 --> 05:56.624
Every once in a while,
it's nice to remind them,

05:56.624 --> 05:58.626
they're the fucking prisoners.

05:58.626 --> 06:01.128
Not us.

06:01.128 --> 06:02.763
- Yeah.

08:16.263 --> 08:19.032
I don't feel sad.

08:21.501 --> 08:23.503
And I don't know why.

08:24.471 --> 08:26.840
I just...

08:26.840 --> 08:30.277
I loved him,
but I don't feel sad.

08:32.212 --> 08:35.983
- You don't have to feel
anything, there's no rules.

08:37.651 --> 08:40.654
- I know what you're thinking,

08:40.654 --> 08:43.824
you know,
this could happen to me.

08:43.824 --> 08:46.894
- It could.

08:49.362 --> 08:51.832
- I can't change the way
things are done here.

08:51.832 --> 08:54.034
- I'm not asking you to, I...

08:54.034 --> 08:56.403
I'm not asking you
to do anything.

08:59.973 --> 09:01.374
- Thank you.

09:03.644 --> 09:06.046
Thank you.

09:08.749 --> 09:11.919
- Except...

09:11.919 --> 09:16.924
- Hey, don't waste
a moment of us, huh.

09:16.924 --> 09:20.260
Because Mitch
is how fast it happens.

10:20.988 --> 10:23.523
- Ugh, we got a word for this.

10:23.523 --> 10:24.758
- Oh yeah?
What's that?

10:24.758 --> 10:26.226
- Arson.

10:26.226 --> 10:28.929
Insurance company's
gonna love you.

10:28.929 --> 10:30.831
- Yeah.

10:31.164 --> 10:33.333
Well, that's the least
of my worries.

10:33.333 --> 10:35.669
- What were you thinkin', Mike?

10:35.669 --> 10:38.071
- How else do you get a stain
out of a carpet?

10:38.071 --> 10:40.140
- A fucking carpet steamer.

10:40.140 --> 10:42.976
- Yeah? Well...
- You okay?

10:42.976 --> 10:45.612
- Yeah, it's no big deal.
- Okay.

10:45.612 --> 10:47.280
Oh my God.

10:48.949 --> 10:51.919
How'd it happen?

10:51.919 --> 10:53.987
- I'm ju--I'm tired
of talkin' about it.

10:53.987 --> 10:56.223
Can we go?

11:17.477 --> 11:20.447
- Cookin' school is
lookin' pretty good, isn't it?

11:22.049 --> 11:24.852
- Sounds silly when you say it.

11:25.618 --> 11:29.322
- Silly is setting your office
on fire to clean it,

11:29.322 --> 11:33.026
rather than move
to a new office.

11:34.294 --> 11:37.464
I mean, you see
the metaphor here right?

11:37.464 --> 11:40.133
I mean, you're not married,
you...

11:40.133 --> 11:43.003
You got nothing tying you down.

11:43.003 --> 11:45.773
Don't owe anybody anything.

11:48.675 --> 11:51.945
There's not one reason
for you to take this on.

11:51.945 --> 11:55.048
- Just tyin' up
some loose ends.

11:55.048 --> 11:57.650
There's a lot of 'em.

11:59.219 --> 12:02.622
- Don't let weeks become years,
Mike.

12:02.622 --> 12:06.093
You won't get 'em back.

12:10.397 --> 12:12.199
- I get you.

12:33.553 --> 12:34.988
- Look, y-you gotta
understand here,

12:34.988 --> 12:38.125
this isn't something
that I can help you with.

12:38.125 --> 12:40.393
They moved him to another cell
closer to the chamber,

12:40.393 --> 12:41.829
there's video surveillance,

12:41.829 --> 12:43.230
they've assigned a guard
to watch him,

12:43.230 --> 12:46.099
until they remove him
for execution, okay?

12:46.099 --> 12:49.336
You're better off
just talking to his attorneys.

12:49.736 --> 12:52.305
- There's no more appeals.

12:52.305 --> 12:54.875
Nothing they can do.

12:54.875 --> 12:56.844
Tomorrow night,
we're supposed to sit there,

12:56.844 --> 12:59.246
right beside them.

12:59.246 --> 13:02.282
And my momma gotta watch
her baby put down like a dog.

13:02.282 --> 13:05.285
- And them, is the family
of the child that he killed,

13:05.285 --> 13:09.122
when he decided to spray
a bus stop with bullets.

13:12.192 --> 13:14.327
Look...

13:14.828 --> 13:16.763
I know your mother
loves her son,

13:16.763 --> 13:18.165
and it's gonna break her,

13:18.165 --> 13:19.232
but this is happening.

13:19.232 --> 13:21.701
There's nothing
anybody can do about it.

13:21.701 --> 13:24.537
Best thing you can do,

13:24.537 --> 13:26.739
look your brother in the eye,

13:26.739 --> 13:29.142
let your smile be
the last thing he sees, okay?

13:30.177 --> 13:33.113
- That's it.

13:39.519 --> 13:42.155
- How can there be nothing?

13:42.155 --> 13:44.057
I don't understand.

13:44.057 --> 13:46.193
I don't understand nothing.

13:46.193 --> 13:48.761
- You will tomorrow.

13:57.204 --> 13:58.638
- Yep?

13:58.638 --> 14:01.274
- Yo,
sorry about your brother man.

14:01.274 --> 14:04.311
I feel for you,
everybody gonna miss him.

14:04.311 --> 14:06.679
- Yeah, thank you.

14:06.679 --> 14:07.981
- How you holdin' up?

14:07.981 --> 14:09.682
You gonna take some time?

14:09.682 --> 14:11.885
- No, no, no, I'm good.

14:11.885 --> 14:15.022
- Yeah, that's good to hear,
you backstabbin' motherfucker.

14:15.022 --> 14:16.756
Pull me off the fucking yard,
huh?

14:16.756 --> 14:18.591
You tryin' to get me killed
motherfucker?

14:18.591 --> 14:20.493
- I'm on my fuckin' way.

14:32.139 --> 14:33.873
- Okay...

14:36.944 --> 14:39.246
Guys,
if someone breaks in here

14:39.246 --> 14:42.049
and cuts open the safe
in the next few weeks,

14:42.049 --> 14:43.150
I'll walk through
your front door

14:43.150 --> 14:45.385
and kill you
in your own kitchen.

14:47.454 --> 14:49.289
It's lookin' good.

14:54.995 --> 14:57.164
- Hey, here come that fool now.

14:58.631 --> 15:00.367
Shit, shit, shit.
- Go, go, go.

15:04.537 --> 15:06.073
- What the fuck, man...

15:08.175 --> 15:09.242
Shit.

15:10.043 --> 15:11.878
Ah, fuck...
Oh my God.

15:11.878 --> 15:14.881
Aw fudge, oh shit man,
you're fucking crazy.

15:14.881 --> 15:16.383
I was just tryin'
to have a conversation.

15:16.383 --> 15:18.151
- You startin' to see
the way we do things now?

15:18.151 --> 15:19.752
- Fucking easy with that
Peckerwood justice, man.

15:19.752 --> 15:21.354
We good.
- No, we're not good.

15:21.354 --> 15:22.355
You hooked a decent kid.

15:22.355 --> 15:24.291
Your boy fucked with him,
your boy lost.

15:24.291 --> 15:26.893
So, it's over, okay?
So I want that letter

15:26.893 --> 15:30.030
on my fucking desk, today.
All right?

15:30.030 --> 15:33.200
Or there's no going back to
the good old days, you and me.

15:33.200 --> 15:36.803
They want their boy,
give him back.

15:36.803 --> 15:38.205
You get the yard back.

15:38.205 --> 15:40.107
- Aight, shit, get that
fucking gun off me, man.

15:40.107 --> 15:43.310
Letter's right there, damn.

15:44.377 --> 15:45.945
- You've had it
this whole fucking time?

15:45.945 --> 15:47.647
- Fuck you, Mike!

15:47.647 --> 15:49.049
Look at my shit,

15:49.049 --> 15:50.883
you gonna fuck my shit up
for that motherfucker?

15:50.883 --> 15:54.854
Aw man, lookit this shit,
lookit this shit, fuck it.

15:55.522 --> 15:58.125
Here, spring my boys.

16:03.396 --> 16:05.332
- Hey, it's me.

16:05.332 --> 16:06.866
We're good.

16:06.866 --> 16:08.701
Wanna put the guys
back where they were?

16:08.701 --> 16:10.437
Thank you.

16:11.971 --> 16:13.973
Too easy, Bunny.

16:14.707 --> 16:16.509
- Tell me this, Mike.

16:16.509 --> 16:18.045
Where you at?

16:18.045 --> 16:20.747
Huh?
I'm fuckin' serious, Mike.

16:20.747 --> 16:22.415
Where you at?
You a friend of me?

16:22.415 --> 16:23.483
Or you a friend of them?

16:23.483 --> 16:24.617
- Oh wait, I'm your...

16:24.617 --> 16:26.619
I'm your friend now?

16:26.619 --> 16:28.188
Is that what I am?
I'm your friend?

16:28.188 --> 16:31.824
- No less a friend
then they are, man.

16:31.824 --> 16:34.694
- Then you're no
friend at all, right?

17:00.953 --> 17:03.290
- You wanna feed 'em,
just feed 'em, not kill 'em?

17:03.290 --> 17:04.791
- Just feed 'em.

17:04.791 --> 17:07.794
- That's not a great idea, Mike.

17:07.794 --> 17:10.097
- Look, it's not a big bear,

17:10.097 --> 17:11.898
it's just like--
it's the size of a dog.

17:11.898 --> 17:13.800
- Now, it's not a big bear now.

17:13.800 --> 17:15.135
But you feed this thing
for a few months,

17:15.135 --> 17:17.170
it'll be a big bear
that's not scared of you.

17:17.170 --> 17:19.772
And thinks your cabin's
a fucking diner.

17:19.772 --> 17:21.341
- Yeah, understood.

17:21.341 --> 17:23.243
What does it,
what does it uh, like to eat?

17:23.243 --> 17:25.612
- Anything man,
it's a fuckin' bear.

17:25.612 --> 17:27.114
They like what we like.

17:27.114 --> 17:30.783
Bagels, grease,
like bacon grease.

17:30.783 --> 17:33.720
Dog food,
fiends for marshmallows.

17:33.720 --> 17:34.954
I just hope mama-bear
don't show up

17:34.954 --> 17:36.956
to see where baby's
gettin' his treats.

17:36.956 --> 17:38.658
- Now, can you kill it
with a pistol?

17:38.658 --> 17:40.093
- What caliber?
- A .40.

17:40.093 --> 17:42.395
- Nope, but you'd sure
piss it off.

17:42.395 --> 17:45.165
- Mm-hmm, what about
with one of these things?

17:49.469 --> 17:51.238
Yeah.

17:52.939 --> 17:55.742
Yeah, it works.
Look at that.

17:56.075 --> 17:58.678
Okay, yeah.

18:22.235 --> 18:24.137
- Knock, knock.
- Yeah.

18:24.137 --> 18:25.972
- Uh, the grease
from your fryer,

18:25.972 --> 18:27.674
what do you do with it?

18:27.674 --> 18:28.941
- Throw it out.

18:28.941 --> 18:30.710
- Can I have it?

18:30.710 --> 18:33.213
- The grease?
- Yeah.

18:33.213 --> 18:35.148
- Sure.
- What about the uh,

18:35.148 --> 18:37.617
those fries come in bags?

18:37.617 --> 18:39.352
- Forty-pound bags.

19:46.353 --> 19:47.987
- Hey.

19:47.987 --> 19:49.822
Get outta here.

19:54.761 --> 19:56.763
It's not for you.

19:56.763 --> 19:58.231
All right.

19:58.665 --> 19:59.732
Get outta here.

19:59.732 --> 20:02.435
Go, get out.

21:01.160 --> 21:03.262
- Morning.
- Yep.

21:03.262 --> 21:05.432
- Special Agent Aldrich,
this is Special Agent Perry.

21:05.432 --> 21:06.999
You mind if we have a chat?

21:08.568 --> 21:09.902
- All right.

21:09.902 --> 21:11.871
Wanna come up?
- Thank you.

21:16.108 --> 21:18.210
- Okay.

21:20.480 --> 21:23.583
- Sorry to hear
about your brother.

21:23.583 --> 21:26.719
- Thank you.

21:26.719 --> 21:29.155
- Do you have any idea
why he was targeted?

21:29.155 --> 21:31.791
- He wasn't targeted,
he was robbed.

21:31.791 --> 21:32.892
- Do you know the connection

21:32.892 --> 21:34.894
between your brother
and Vera Sunter?

21:34.894 --> 21:37.664
- The woman who was slain
by Mr. Ramos.

21:37.664 --> 21:39.966
- Yeah, didn't you guys
bother reading his file?

21:39.966 --> 21:42.001
- We just wanted
to hear it from you.

21:44.070 --> 21:45.472
- Okay.

21:48.040 --> 21:51.478
Mitch helped arrange the
surrender of Milo Sunter

21:51.478 --> 21:53.880
after an armored car heist.

21:53.880 --> 21:55.948
- In which
two armed guards were killed.

21:55.948 --> 21:59.452
- Correct, yes.
And then part of that deal,

21:59.452 --> 22:02.555
Milo was able to keep and hide,

22:02.555 --> 22:03.890
a portion of what he stole

22:03.890 --> 22:06.125
to be returned to him
upon his release.

22:06.125 --> 22:07.794
- He was sentenced to life,
correct?

22:07.794 --> 22:09.061
- Correct.

22:09.061 --> 22:10.563
- So, you hid
the money for him?

22:10.563 --> 22:11.898
- No.
- Was Mitch's murder

22:11.898 --> 22:13.600
about somebody
trying to get the money?

22:13.600 --> 22:15.902
- Yeah.
- Where is this money now?

22:15.902 --> 22:18.505
- I'm--for the love of God.

22:18.505 --> 22:20.039
All this is in the paper,
you guys.

22:20.039 --> 22:20.973
Why are you
asking me questions,

22:20.973 --> 22:22.909
you know the answer to?

22:22.909 --> 22:24.611
- We had an arrangement
with your brother.

22:24.611 --> 22:26.178
- Ah...
- We're here to decide

22:26.178 --> 22:28.448
if we should make
that same arrangement with you.

22:28.448 --> 22:31.951
- Your brother received $2500
a month as a paid informant.

22:31.951 --> 22:33.753
Are you aware of this?
- I am aware.

22:33.753 --> 22:35.321
- Care to tell us anything
about the altercation

22:35.321 --> 22:37.924
you were involved in
yesterday at the Commons?

22:37.924 --> 22:40.126
- What altercation was that?
- The one where you

22:40.126 --> 22:43.329
detonated a concussion grenade
and brandished a firearm.

22:43.329 --> 22:44.997
- I have a CCO.

22:44.997 --> 22:48.901
- Hmm, yeah, a convicted felon
with a concealed carry permit.

22:48.901 --> 22:51.638
I hope you can appreciate the
magnitude of corruption

22:51.638 --> 22:53.606
that went into
making that all happen.

22:53.606 --> 22:54.874
- I do.

22:54.874 --> 22:57.209
- What do you know
about Deverin Washington?

22:57.209 --> 22:58.978
- Bunny.

22:58.978 --> 23:01.380
Yeah,
he's a fuckin' drug dealer.

23:01.380 --> 23:02.582
What else do you wanna know?

23:02.582 --> 23:03.950
He runs the Crips, not a set,

23:03.950 --> 23:05.485
he runs the whole
God damn thing, right?

23:05.485 --> 23:08.555
He sits in his front yard,
sells drugs, all day, every day.

23:08.555 --> 23:11.223
He's got a cooler with eight
pounds of crack and meth in it.

23:11.223 --> 23:14.360
So, you can go arrest him
anytime you want.

23:14.627 --> 23:16.162
- If you would be interested,

23:16.162 --> 23:21.367
in being a paid informant.
- Yes! Fuck, gimme the paper.

23:21.367 --> 23:22.969
All right, thank you.

23:22.969 --> 23:26.205
- Initial by the--
- Yeah, yeah, Mm-hmm...

23:28.641 --> 23:31.077
Okay, got a check?

23:31.077 --> 23:34.814
- Sign that you've received it.
- All right, here ya go.

23:35.214 --> 23:37.183
Thank you.
- Now, what I would

23:37.183 --> 23:39.285
like you to do--
- Look, this is how it goes.

23:39.285 --> 23:42.188
I don't do stings,
I don't wear a fucking wire,

23:42.188 --> 23:43.956
and if someone asks me
if I'm on your payroll,

23:43.956 --> 23:45.792
I tell 'em the truth, okay?

23:45.792 --> 23:47.527
What I do here
and what I do

23:47.527 --> 23:49.496
with other people here,

23:49.496 --> 23:50.997
stays here.

23:50.997 --> 23:53.265
So, if I bend a rule with a cop

23:53.265 --> 23:55.735
to prevent a woman
from becoming a widow,

23:55.735 --> 23:58.070
don't run that cop
up a flagpole.

23:58.070 --> 24:01.073
You wanna know who's
running what, anytime, where?

24:01.073 --> 24:04.143
Come to me,
but do not fucking use me.

24:04.143 --> 24:06.646
For anything,
I have broken many a law

24:06.646 --> 24:08.114
with feds standing
right next to me.

24:08.114 --> 24:10.416
So, if you're here
for some sort of civic cleanup,

24:10.416 --> 24:13.252
just know, you have a lot of
sweeping in your house too.

24:13.252 --> 24:15.021
Okay?

24:15.421 --> 24:17.089
- Fair enough.

24:17.089 --> 24:18.491
- Great.

24:18.491 --> 24:20.426
Get the fuck outta my office.

24:21.761 --> 24:24.631
- We'll be in touch.

24:24.631 --> 24:26.332
- No doubt.

24:36.843 --> 24:38.310
- You make coffee?

24:38.310 --> 24:40.479
- Yeah.

24:41.681 --> 24:43.783
- Do you want some?

24:43.783 --> 24:45.484
- Mm-hmm.

25:00.900 --> 25:04.203
- So, we still in business?

25:10.176 --> 25:13.045
- What else am I gonna do?

25:16.849 --> 25:18.718
- Right.

25:18.718 --> 25:22.221
Yep?
- Hey buddy, we need a favor.

25:22.221 --> 25:24.323
What are you gonna do
with Mitch's Caddy?

25:36.035 --> 25:38.004
Mike, thanks for doing this.

25:38.004 --> 25:39.939
You know everybody, right?
- Yeah.

25:39.939 --> 25:41.841
- Radio.
- Got it.

25:41.841 --> 25:43.475
- Hey, you didn't wanna
bring the Lincoln?

25:43.475 --> 25:45.277
- No, he told me
to bring the Caddy.

25:45.277 --> 25:47.847
- Caddy's fuckin' 40 years old,
Lincoln's way newer.

25:47.847 --> 25:49.849
- That's somethin' poetic
about it, right?

25:49.849 --> 25:51.283
- Well, for the record,
let me just say

25:51.283 --> 25:53.419
how fuckin' ridiculous this is,
all right.

25:53.419 --> 25:54.987
- For the record,
let me just say

25:54.987 --> 25:56.388
that this guy is movin'
a fuckin' ton of meth.

25:56.388 --> 25:57.957
And he is the top,
he is not a runner,

25:57.957 --> 25:59.158
he's the fuckin' cook

25:59.158 --> 26:01.127
and he's squeaky fuckin' clean,
this guy.

26:01.127 --> 26:03.863
Guy's like Mr. Magoo,
he's smart.

26:03.863 --> 26:05.998
Us, we knocked out
his fuckin' taillight,

26:05.998 --> 26:07.867
this fucker calls AAA,
has them come fix it

26:07.867 --> 26:10.402
in the parking lot at Costco,
he's good.

26:10.402 --> 26:12.471
- All right, well I don't got
all fucking day.

26:12.471 --> 26:14.607
Let's do this.
- Let's saddle up, let's go.

26:14.607 --> 26:16.242
- I'm ridin' with Mike.

26:16.242 --> 26:17.777
- Kyle, you think
Mr. Magoo's attorney's

26:17.777 --> 26:20.212
not gonna figure that out?
You ride with me, let's go.

26:20.212 --> 26:23.683
Come on, come on, you're hurtin'
my feelings, let's go.

26:47.539 --> 26:50.476
- KYLE: Mike, turn right
at York, he's in a gray Subaru.

27:12.564 --> 27:14.300
- Oh shit.

27:16.936 --> 27:18.304
- All right, Mike.
He should be at

27:18.304 --> 27:20.606
the intersection of York
and 23rd in about 60 seconds.

27:20.606 --> 27:22.641
- Hell, that's 10 blocks away.
I'm at a light.

27:22.641 --> 27:25.277
- You're good Mike,
you can make it in 45 seconds.

27:29.148 --> 27:31.017
- All right, I'm moving.
- Thirty seconds.

27:31.017 --> 27:34.453
- Shit, there's too much
traffic, hang on.

27:35.587 --> 27:37.223
All right, you got it.

27:39.591 --> 27:41.227
- Fifteen seconds.

27:44.063 --> 27:46.632
- I don't see him.
- He'll be there.

27:49.068 --> 27:51.670
- Shit, I'm through.
I didn't see him.

27:51.670 --> 27:53.205
Look, I don't see him.

28:07.486 --> 28:09.455
- 24th Street, fuckface.
- Oops.

28:09.455 --> 28:11.223
Lookit, the impact
knocked the crystal

28:11.223 --> 28:13.325
all over the God damned street,
it's a great bust, Mike.

28:13.325 --> 28:14.727
You gotta look on
the bright side here.

28:14.727 --> 28:16.095
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Ha!

28:16.095 --> 28:18.865
- Until the fucker
sues me all over the place.

28:18.865 --> 28:20.232
- This car's a fucking tank,
Mike.

28:20.232 --> 28:21.934
You can drive that shit home,
brother.

28:21.934 --> 28:23.335
- Yeah, right.
- Mike.

28:23.335 --> 28:25.404
Mike, this kind of thing,
in time, is gonna be funny.

28:25.404 --> 28:27.139
I swear to God.
I swear to God.

28:27.139 --> 28:28.808
Skedaddle, let's get him.

28:28.808 --> 28:30.810
Let's go, let's get him out.

28:30.810 --> 28:34.013
- Hey man, thanks,
the way you handled that shit

28:34.013 --> 28:35.281
the other day.
Means a lot, thank you.

28:35.281 --> 28:38.484
- It's my pleasure, brother.
- Yeah.

28:39.651 --> 28:42.388
- All right, let's get him,
get him outta there.

28:42.855 --> 28:45.191
- Look at this fucker.

28:54.600 --> 28:56.869
- GUARD: Walk towards me
until I say stop.

28:58.104 --> 28:59.671
Stop.

28:59.671 --> 29:01.340
Remove your jacket.

29:02.474 --> 29:04.710
Have a seat,
remove your shoes.

29:14.553 --> 29:15.888
Stand.

29:17.356 --> 29:19.758
Get dressed,
stand over there.

30:00.366 --> 30:03.502
- He did this to you?

30:04.370 --> 30:06.605
- He said if you
ever threaten him again--

30:06.605 --> 30:09.041
- Yeah, I'm sure.

30:09.041 --> 30:10.943
- He doesn't have the balls.

30:10.943 --> 30:13.913
- He's different
than his brother.

30:13.913 --> 30:17.283
More like us.

30:17.283 --> 30:19.485
He needs to go back out there,

30:19.485 --> 30:23.222
some other things to move, now.

30:24.790 --> 30:27.593
Don't threaten him again.

30:28.060 --> 30:31.497
And send someone else.

30:31.497 --> 30:33.165
- Who?

30:33.165 --> 30:35.935
- Someone like Vera.

30:35.935 --> 30:38.770
That's the way with this one.

30:42.174 --> 30:44.877
Where's Iris?

30:44.877 --> 30:46.913
- New York.

30:46.913 --> 30:48.780
- Send her.

31:00.859 --> 31:02.328
- Mike, who--

31:02.328 --> 31:04.897
Oh my God, your face.

31:04.897 --> 31:07.233
- Oh yeah,
it has that effect on people.

31:07.233 --> 31:08.935
- Are you up
to seeing somebody?

31:08.935 --> 31:11.837
- Not really, but...

31:11.837 --> 31:15.874
- You need anything?
- Naw, I'm fine, just...

31:19.145 --> 31:21.447
- Is it okay?
- Yeah, come in, have a seat.

31:25.952 --> 31:28.054
Yeah, it's uh,
I had an accident.

31:28.054 --> 31:30.656
- I'm sorry.
- Yeah.

31:30.656 --> 31:32.624
So, what can I do for you?

31:32.624 --> 31:35.761
- In the waiting room
at the prison, everyone talks.

31:35.761 --> 31:38.230
And they talk about you.

31:38.230 --> 31:40.266
They say you did this
and can do that.

31:40.266 --> 31:42.468
And if something
can't be done there

31:42.468 --> 31:45.404
you can do it from here.

31:45.404 --> 31:48.807
A woman told me,
for $500 you give advice

31:48.807 --> 31:53.145
on what to do.
For more you get involved.

31:53.145 --> 31:55.214
But, how much more, it depends.
- Yeah, look,

31:55.214 --> 31:58.284
there's nothing I can do
to help your brother.

31:58.284 --> 32:00.719
And there's no way
for me to get involved

32:00.719 --> 32:03.822
for any amount of money.

32:03.822 --> 32:06.692
- But you can advise.

32:06.692 --> 32:10.963
My father would say, you fear
what you do not understand.

32:10.963 --> 32:13.799
And to understand this,

32:13.799 --> 32:16.335
maybe we can survive it.

32:20.172 --> 32:22.841
- You're gonna survive it.

32:22.841 --> 32:24.043
But nothing any of us do,

32:24.043 --> 32:27.746
is gonna help
your brother survive.

32:27.746 --> 32:31.183
- Will you be there
with us tonight?

32:31.183 --> 32:34.486
Can I hire you to do that?

32:39.558 --> 32:41.560
- Yeah.

32:42.428 --> 32:44.330
Yeah, I can do that.

33:16.795 --> 33:20.032
- I know what you're thinkin'.

33:20.032 --> 33:23.469
- God, you're beautiful.

33:28.107 --> 33:30.276
- You're beautiful.

33:33.845 --> 33:36.415
Look at you.

33:39.751 --> 33:41.653
Baby.

33:42.421 --> 33:45.357
I gotta go.

34:04.776 --> 34:07.213
- JOSEPH: Come to Kingstown.
- Why?

34:07.213 --> 34:10.149
- Because I told you to.

35:00.098 --> 35:02.434
- Sit down on the right.

35:02.434 --> 35:04.236
- Hey,
w-what are you doing here?

35:04.236 --> 35:06.338
- Hey, what are you doing here?

35:06.338 --> 35:08.274
- Motherfucker
murdered my niece.

35:08.274 --> 35:09.708
- Sorry to hear that.

35:09.708 --> 35:11.243
- You here for him?

35:11.243 --> 35:13.044
- I'm here to explain
the process to his mother,

35:13.044 --> 35:15.181
I've never met him.

35:15.181 --> 35:17.416
- This fool gonna
feel anything?

35:17.416 --> 35:20.152
- Suffering's in the mind,
he's been doing that for years.

35:22.087 --> 35:25.157
- I want him to feel it.

35:25.157 --> 35:26.792
- Well, today's your lucky day.

35:26.792 --> 35:28.927
- GUARD: Please be seated.

35:29.528 --> 35:31.863
The seat you choose now,
is the seat you must remain in

35:31.863 --> 35:34.600
until the end
of the proceedings.

35:34.600 --> 35:36.235
Do not stand up.

35:36.235 --> 35:38.637
Do not approach the glass.

35:38.637 --> 35:41.340
Only address members
of your own party.

35:41.340 --> 35:44.710
Do not speak above a whisper.

35:44.710 --> 35:48.680
To do any of these things, is a
violation of state code 442-48,

35:48.680 --> 35:51.082
which is punishable
by up to six months in prison

35:51.082 --> 35:53.852
and a fine of up to $1000.

35:53.852 --> 35:56.288
If you need to be excused,
raise your hand and wait for

35:56.288 --> 36:00.091
a corrections officer to
escort you from the premises.

36:00.091 --> 36:02.561
Any questions?

36:16.875 --> 36:21.213
- The warden's going to read the
sentence to the gallery.

36:21.213 --> 36:23.815
- Who's the gallery?

36:23.815 --> 36:26.051
- That would be us.

36:38.964 --> 36:40.699
- Juan Jesus Garcia,
having been found

36:40.699 --> 36:42.901
guilty of capital murder,

36:42.901 --> 36:47.473
has been sentenced to death
by lethal injection.

36:47.473 --> 36:49.875
Please bring in the condemned.

37:10.929 --> 37:12.230
- Juan Jesus Garcia,

37:12.230 --> 37:15.767
you have been sentenced,
by a jury of your peers,

37:15.767 --> 37:18.470
to a sentence of death.

37:18.470 --> 37:21.607
Before that sentence commences,

37:21.607 --> 37:25.877
you may address the gallery
if you have any last words.

37:32.050 --> 37:33.952
- Listen to me,

37:33.952 --> 37:36.488
he's already gone,
this isn't him.

37:36.488 --> 37:39.791
You understand?
Just find the strength.

37:39.791 --> 37:42.361
Look him in the eye.

37:42.361 --> 37:44.863
Remember the best of him.

38:09.154 --> 38:09.988
- Quiet in front.

38:17.162 --> 38:20.432
- Do you have anything
you want to say?

38:24.169 --> 38:26.271
- Mama...

38:35.381 --> 38:38.917
To you, for the girl...

38:40.318 --> 38:42.621
I'm sorry.

38:50.095 --> 38:52.931
Fuck it.
Kill me.

38:53.432 --> 38:55.901
- Would you like
last rites performed?

38:57.636 --> 38:59.505
- Si...

39:54.493 --> 39:57.996
- Okay, the doctors
are starting an IV,

39:57.996 --> 40:00.599
to administer the...

40:00.599 --> 40:04.335
medication.

40:10.241 --> 40:12.978
- Then the warden will wait for
a phone call from the governor

40:12.978 --> 40:15.046
for a stay of execution.

40:16.648 --> 40:20.118
But,
don't tell your mother that.

41:13.104 --> 41:15.541
- Tell your mom to look down.

41:22.047 --> 41:26.084
- I want you to repeat
exactly what I say.

41:26.084 --> 41:28.887
He's asleep.

41:31.557 --> 41:34.392
- There's no pain.

41:37.529 --> 41:39.898
- There's no pain.

41:43.368 --> 41:45.303
- No pain.

42:31.683 --> 42:34.552
- Please rise
and exit the door you came in.

42:43.194 --> 42:44.596
- Damn Mike.

42:44.596 --> 42:45.964
You coulda warned me.

42:45.964 --> 42:49.267
- Yeah, how do you prepare
for something like that?

43:05.483 --> 43:07.653
- I'll be outside.

44:44.415 --> 44:47.552
- Yeah, that's what the fuck
I'm talkin' about right here.

44:47.552 --> 44:49.855
How come none of y'all
never bought me no chair?

44:49.855 --> 44:50.922
- I don't know.

44:50.922 --> 44:54.492
- Hey.
- What's good, baby?

44:54.893 --> 44:56.594
Yeah.

44:56.594 --> 44:59.330
Shit, matching colors too?
Man, God damn.

44:59.330 --> 45:00.698
- I don't suppose
you got something to drink

45:00.698 --> 45:03.234
in those coolers.
- Naw, not in this cooler, man.

45:03.234 --> 45:06.237
Hey, V, Trel,
get us a couple of beers, man.

45:06.805 --> 45:09.607
Ugh.

45:11.576 --> 45:13.278
- Thanks.

45:17.582 --> 45:19.450
- Where you been?

45:22.020 --> 45:25.090
- You know that Scorpion
that uh, shot that little girl?

45:25.090 --> 45:27.725
In that drive-by
over by the Titan?

45:29.394 --> 45:31.596
He was executed tonight.

45:31.596 --> 45:34.665
- Shit.

45:34.665 --> 45:36.134
Why were you there?

45:36.134 --> 45:38.469
- That's a long story.

45:38.469 --> 45:41.639
Fuck.
- I ain't never seen one, man.

45:41.639 --> 45:43.241
Not in no prison.

45:43.241 --> 45:46.344
Shit, I guess
there's worse ways to go.

45:46.344 --> 45:48.413
- Oh, I don't know
about that buddy.

45:53.118 --> 45:55.253
- You ever wonder?

45:55.686 --> 45:57.288
Like...

45:58.356 --> 46:00.892
There's all these fools,
right...

46:00.892 --> 46:04.830
They worried about
they kid got a B in science.

46:04.830 --> 46:09.000
Uh, the tranny in the van's
gotta be serviced.

46:09.000 --> 46:10.535
Where we gonna
spend Christmas at?

46:10.535 --> 46:14.239
The lake house or Grandma's?
Shit...

46:15.206 --> 46:17.642
You know, I'm 37 years old.

46:17.642 --> 46:20.711
I ain't never celebrated
Christmas in my life.

46:22.948 --> 46:26.084
You're born, you suffer,
you die.

46:26.084 --> 46:28.586
And young at that.

46:28.586 --> 46:32.023
Let me let you in
on a little secret, Mike.

46:32.023 --> 46:34.025
You're no different.

46:34.025 --> 46:37.795
You're just as far under the bus
as the rest of us, bro.

46:37.795 --> 46:41.199
And we all be leavin'
the same way.

46:41.199 --> 46:43.501
Once you've been
in the jaws of the beast,

46:45.536 --> 46:48.907
some day he gonna
finish his meal.

46:51.742 --> 46:53.945
- You remember uh,
when you're a little kid.

46:56.114 --> 46:58.850
And you used to think that,
you know,

46:58.850 --> 47:00.318
that maybe you could do
something in life

47:00.318 --> 47:03.354
that makes you happy.

47:03.354 --> 47:05.690
And then you figure out

47:05.690 --> 47:09.160
that there's no such thing
as happy.

47:09.160 --> 47:11.129
- That's what
I'm talkin' about.

47:11.129 --> 47:13.231
I knew this shit was it.

47:13.231 --> 47:14.799
Always.

47:14.799 --> 47:18.503
- Been readin' online

47:18.503 --> 47:20.705
about this school
they have in Wyoming.

47:20.705 --> 47:22.473
- Hmm.

47:22.473 --> 47:24.442
- And there they teach you
how to do this uh,

47:24.442 --> 47:26.244
this camp cooking.
- Word.

47:26.244 --> 47:28.213
- You know,
cookin' on this open fire,

47:28.213 --> 47:31.016
like you're all outside,

47:31.016 --> 47:32.650
everybody lives in a tent.

47:32.650 --> 47:36.121
Kind of cook food for a bunch
of different people, you know?

47:36.121 --> 47:37.455
- What kind of food?

47:37.455 --> 47:42.994
- Uh, like steaks and stews,
biscuits...

47:42.994 --> 47:46.431
- Yo, when I was like nine,

47:46.431 --> 47:49.634
I spent two weeks in Alabama
with my grandmama, right?

47:49.634 --> 47:52.470
She cooked everything outside.

47:52.470 --> 47:56.074
Sourdough biscuits, gravy...

47:56.074 --> 47:57.943
- No shit.
- Yeah.

47:59.844 --> 48:02.313
- She teach you how to do it?
- Naw,

48:02.313 --> 48:04.449
but I seen it though, man.

48:04.449 --> 48:08.286
She'd uh, she'd keep the starter
in the icebox right,

48:08.286 --> 48:10.588
pull off a piece.

48:10.588 --> 48:15.860
Then she'd cover the bottom of
the Dutch oven in bacon grease.

48:15.860 --> 48:19.897
That's the trick to that shit,
man.

48:21.432 --> 48:24.402
Bacon grease
in the bottom of the pan.

48:25.971 --> 48:28.006
Yeah.

49:00.838 --> 49:03.874
- Next time on
"Mayor of Kingstown"...

49:03.874 --> 49:05.643
- Gentlemen,
this is a capital case.

49:05.643 --> 49:08.379
- Better yet, this maggot
doesn't make it to court.

49:08.379 --> 49:09.914
- Guys, do you know
what you're asking?

49:09.914 --> 49:11.282
- I'm not asking anything.

49:12.583 --> 49:14.419
You are.

49:14.419 --> 49:17.188
- We all know
this won't be free for anybody.

49:17.188 --> 49:19.024
- This is a deal
with the Devil.

49:19.024 --> 49:20.925
- Just, put it together Mike.

49:20.925 --> 49:22.860
- There are no good cops now.

49:22.860 --> 49:24.595
- This levy gotta break,

49:24.595 --> 49:27.032
sometimes you just gotta
make that dam bust open.
