00:01.154 --> 00:02.303
Previously on "The Path"...

00:02.304 --> 00:04.323
What about the guy who did this to me?

00:04.324 --> 00:07.273
Fucking animal has got my daughter.

00:07.274 --> 00:09.243
When I was 11, my dad told me

00:09.244 --> 00:12.113
that his friend was coming over
and I should do what he said,

00:12.114 --> 00:14.123
otherwise I'd get hit.

00:14.124 --> 00:17.243
- You believe in the movement.
- No, I believe in you.

00:17.244 --> 00:19.193
Love Sean. You're beautiful together.

00:19.194 --> 00:22.113
They killed my husband
when he tried to leave.

00:22.114 --> 00:24.173
I looked up what happened to Jason,

00:24.174 --> 00:25.253
and he took his own life.

00:25.254 --> 00:27.183
You take Freddie out of here,

00:27.184 --> 00:29.123
and he will have a needle
in his arm within 24 hours.

00:29.124 --> 00:30.263
Silas will meet you at the airport.

00:30.264 --> 00:32.302
He's gonna help you
to get Freddie better.

00:32.304 --> 00:34.283
So, are you allowed to go to parties?

00:34.284 --> 00:37.163
- There's one tomorrow.
- I don't think I'm allowed.

00:37.164 --> 00:40.113
- You actually came.
- Yeah.

00:40.114 --> 00:43.163
I'd like to be your guide, Eddie.

00:43.164 --> 00:45.133
You want me to do 7R?

00:45.134 --> 00:47.203
You just want me to dig?

00:47.204 --> 00:48.294
Dig until you find something.

02:19.254 --> 02:22.234
What is it? What do you see?

02:31.294 --> 02:33.134
Found something, didn't you?

02:58.214 --> 03:01.223
- What's going on?
- Hawk's not here.

03:01.224 --> 03:03.183
What do you mean he's not there?

03:03.184 --> 03:05.293
I mean he's not here. He
didn't sleep in his bed.

03:05.294 --> 03:07.263
I-I don't know where he is.

03:07.264 --> 03:10.223
Okay. Okay, I'll be right home.

03:22.214 --> 03:23.313
Ashley.

03:23.314 --> 03:26.213
Ashley, come on, wake up. We slept.

03:26.214 --> 03:29.103
I have to go. My parents
are gonna kill me.

03:29.104 --> 03:31.103
Hey, maybe they're not up yet.

03:31.104 --> 03:33.324
Oh, I'm so dead.

03:53.304 --> 03:55.283
Mm.

03:55.284 --> 03:57.153
Morning.

03:57.154 --> 04:00.134
Mm, morning.

04:31.304 --> 04:33.323
Um...

04:33.324 --> 04:37.143
we don't have to if you don't want to.

04:37.144 --> 04:40.104
We can wait.

04:42.154 --> 04:45.314
I don't want to wait.

05:44.294 --> 05:46.113
Hey, here he is!

05:46.114 --> 05:48.173
- Hey.
- Oh!

05:48.174 --> 05:49.333
Where you been?

05:49.334 --> 05:52.163
- Where were you?
- What's everyone doing here?

05:52.164 --> 05:53.323
Wondering where the hell you've been.

05:53.324 --> 05:55.223
Just be honest with us, kid.

05:55.224 --> 05:57.173
Can we talk about this alone?

05:57.174 --> 05:58.273
No, you're gonna answer to all of us.

05:58.274 --> 06:00.323
You put us all through
hell this morning.

06:00.324 --> 06:03.153
Well?

06:03.154 --> 06:05.163
Hawk?

06:05.164 --> 06:07.203
He's been seeing a girl.

06:07.204 --> 06:08.263
- What?
- Joy!

06:08.264 --> 06:10.113
Shut up!

06:10.114 --> 06:12.143
Mom, please, can we have some privacy?

06:12.144 --> 06:14.253
- What girl?
- An IS girl from school.

06:14.254 --> 06:16.323
I saw them coming out of
Matthew's Diner together.

06:16.324 --> 06:18.323
- You're a jerk, Joy.
- Don't you call Joy a jerk.

06:18.324 --> 06:20.323
She's trying to help
you. She's being honest.

06:20.324 --> 06:23.103
- She's not helping me.
- Look, he can be realigned.

06:23.104 --> 06:24.263
This happened with
Robert's girl, remember?

06:24.264 --> 06:26.203
Not everyone can be realigned, Nicole.

06:26.204 --> 06:29.303
I know Steve said 16,
but this is too dangerous.

06:29.304 --> 06:31.303
You need to deal with this, Sarah.

06:31.304 --> 06:33.313
- I know I do, Mom.
- No, you don't know.

06:33.314 --> 06:35.303
You don't know what it's
like to lose a child.

06:35.304 --> 06:37.163
All right, I understand

06:37.164 --> 06:38.313
that this is very personal for everyone,

06:38.314 --> 06:41.163
but I think Sarah and I
should take it from here.

06:41.164 --> 06:44.123
Hawk, go up to your room,
and we'll handle this later.

06:44.124 --> 06:45.263
Is it true?

06:45.264 --> 06:47.333
Is that where you were, with an IS?

06:47.334 --> 06:49.183
Hawk!

06:49.184 --> 06:51.333
How long have you known about this?

06:51.334 --> 06:53.284
How did this happen?

07:05.314 --> 07:09.223
Look, you want to put her in here?

07:09.224 --> 07:12.333
- It's gonna be okay, baby.
- Uh-huh.

07:15.334 --> 07:18.113
What are you doing?

07:18.114 --> 07:19.193
We drove the car in.

07:19.194 --> 07:21.153
I know. I got work to do.

07:21.154 --> 07:22.333
I'll just be gone a couple hours.

07:22.334 --> 07:25.133
After that?

07:25.134 --> 07:27.283
Yeah, and then I'll come right home.

07:27.284 --> 07:29.243
It's just tests, Jocey.

07:29.244 --> 07:31.283
The doctor said the results
won't even be back today.

07:31.284 --> 07:33.153
But I'm shook up.

07:33.154 --> 07:36.113
Yeah, so am I, but I
still got to go to work.

07:36.114 --> 07:38.303
Hey, I love you, Butterball.

07:38.304 --> 07:41.133
Hmm? Mwah. I'll see you in a bit.

07:41.134 --> 07:43.273
You have a good mimi, okay?

07:43.274 --> 07:45.293
I love you too.

07:45.294 --> 07:47.293
Be back soon.

07:47.294 --> 07:49.274
I promise.

07:57.144 --> 07:59.243
Hey, here you go.

07:59.244 --> 08:02.234
All right.

08:09.184 --> 08:11.243
- John.
- Where are they?

08:11.244 --> 08:14.173
What are you talking
about? What's going on?

08:14.174 --> 08:15.283
I've been in London on business.

08:15.284 --> 08:18.213
I come home, and my
wife and son are gone.

08:18.214 --> 08:22.193
You and your people took them
somewhere to feed them drugs

08:22.194 --> 08:24.103
and your mystic bullshit.

08:24.104 --> 08:26.143
Mr. Ridge, I have no
idea where your family is.

08:26.144 --> 08:28.244
I'll tell you where
they are, Bum-Fuck Peru.

08:31.144 --> 08:34.313
Well, if they are, um, I
promise I did not sign off

08:34.313 --> 08:36.283
on any of my people
taking them anywhere.

08:36.284 --> 08:38.102
Seems to me you don't have

08:38.104 --> 08:40.123
much control over your people, then.

08:40.124 --> 08:42.123
I'd imagine that's something
someone in charge of a cult

08:42.124 --> 08:43.232
might decide to prioritize.

08:43.234 --> 08:44.303
I will get to the bottom of it, John.

08:44.304 --> 08:47.194
- I promise you.
- You bet you will.

09:09.234 --> 09:11.233
Who is it?

09:11.234 --> 09:14.214
Agent Abraham Gaines, FBI.

09:18.194 --> 09:19.224
Alison Kemp?

09:22.284 --> 09:25.113
Found you through your Website.

09:25.114 --> 09:27.334
I'm looking into the Meyerist Movement.

09:34.214 --> 09:36.134
I'm glad somebody finally is.

09:40.194 --> 09:42.333
Hey, listen...

09:42.334 --> 09:47.153
I'm sorry, but, uh, if you think
that they killed your husband

09:47.154 --> 09:49.173
and that they are trying to kill you,

09:49.174 --> 09:53.103
why are you staying so
close to their campus?

09:53.104 --> 09:55.163
I want them to own up to what they did.

09:55.164 --> 09:57.313
I want answers.

09:57.314 --> 09:59.163
And how are you so certain

09:59.164 --> 10:00.283
your husband didn't kill himself?

10:00.284 --> 10:02.113
I read the police report.

10:02.114 --> 10:03.223
That he jumped off of a mountain

10:03.224 --> 10:05.263
he climbed a million times before

10:05.264 --> 10:08.183
in the middle of the day and nobody saw?

10:08.184 --> 10:10.303
Yeah, that's fucking bullshit.

10:12.174 --> 10:14.303
And the morning that he jumped,

10:14.304 --> 10:16.303
he called me.

10:16.304 --> 10:20.133
He told me he was having doubts.

10:20.134 --> 10:21.333
Doubts?

10:21.334 --> 10:23.293
They had him on some secret mission,

10:23.294 --> 10:26.123
flying him to Peru every other week.

10:26.124 --> 10:28.263
And he never told you
what that mission was?

10:28.264 --> 10:30.193
That morning he said,
"This is the last time."

10:30.194 --> 10:31.333
"This is the last time."

10:31.334 --> 10:33.223
Was that it?

10:33.224 --> 10:36.183
I said, "You're gone so much,"

10:36.184 --> 10:39.173
and he said, "This is the last time."

10:39.174 --> 10:41.303
It was the way he said it...

10:41.304 --> 10:43.323
with such conviction.

10:43.324 --> 10:45.233
It scared me.

10:45.234 --> 10:48.123
You know, someone who was
depressed might say that,

10:48.124 --> 10:49.253
who was gonna commit suicide.

10:49.254 --> 10:51.203
Why are you even here
if you don't give a shit

10:51.204 --> 10:52.253
about what I have to say?

10:52.254 --> 10:54.143
I give a shit, Alison.

10:54.144 --> 10:55.283
I'm just trying to
get the bigger picture.

10:55.284 --> 10:57.273
All Jason wanted to do
was something meaningful

10:57.274 --> 11:01.113
with his life, and now he's dead.

11:01.114 --> 11:05.223
And they... they all get
to go on with their lives...

11:05.224 --> 11:09.143
Steve Meyer, Cal Roberts,

11:09.144 --> 11:12.213
the fucking cops in Peru,
the cops in San Diego.

11:12.214 --> 11:14.243
It's fucking bullshit!

11:14.244 --> 11:16.273
Yeah.

11:16.274 --> 11:21.233
Hey, I appreciate you talking to me.

11:21.234 --> 11:23.223
Wait, wait, wait.

11:23.224 --> 11:25.223
- How can you protect me?
- Excuse me?

11:25.224 --> 11:27.153
You're with the fucking FBI.

11:27.154 --> 11:29.193
You know, you might
want to get out of here

11:29.194 --> 11:31.103
and start a new life.

11:31.104 --> 11:33.233
Let us figure out what happened.

12:12.124 --> 12:14.313
I think we should pull him
out of school on Monday.

12:14.314 --> 12:16.153
Look, let's just...

12:16.154 --> 12:17.283
Can we just slow down for a second?

12:17.284 --> 12:19.213
Our son spent the night with a girl

12:19.214 --> 12:21.213
that we didn't even know
about, an IS girl, all right?

12:21.214 --> 12:23.293
He's been lying to us for...
for who knows how long.

12:23.294 --> 12:25.303
- God, I'm starving.
- Are you listening?

12:25.304 --> 12:27.283
Do you have any idea
how serious this is?

12:27.284 --> 12:29.163
Yes, I do.

12:29.164 --> 12:32.244
I'm just... I can't think until I eat.

12:39.144 --> 12:40.323
I'm freaking out.

12:40.324 --> 12:42.183
I know.

12:42.184 --> 12:43.263
None for me.

12:43.264 --> 12:44.303
7R... no caffeine.

12:44.304 --> 12:46.133
I thought we were close.

12:46.134 --> 12:47.243
I thought Hawk told me everything.

12:47.244 --> 12:49.143
Look, you are close.

12:49.144 --> 12:51.153
Who knows how long this
has been going on, you know?

12:51.154 --> 12:53.133
It might just be hormones.

12:53.134 --> 12:55.273
The fact that it is
going on makes me sick.

12:55.274 --> 12:58.123
Well, I mean, he's a teenager.

12:58.124 --> 13:00.303
Okay, I understand that
this is terrifying for you

13:00.304 --> 13:02.123
because of Tessa, but it's...

13:02.124 --> 13:03.313
This has nothing to do with Tessa.

13:03.314 --> 13:05.223
He's nothing like her.

13:05.224 --> 13:08.303
I just remember pushing
and pushing my folks,

13:08.304 --> 13:10.313
and the best thing they
did was not push back, so...

13:10.314 --> 13:12.273
Yeah, well, from what you told me,

13:12.274 --> 13:14.273
their lack of intervention
didn't work out so well for you,

13:14.274 --> 13:17.164
especially not your brother.

13:18.294 --> 13:20.104
Wow.

13:22.304 --> 13:24.124
That was out of line.

13:28.244 --> 13:31.243
I'm sorry.

13:31.244 --> 13:34.143
I can't lose him.

13:34.144 --> 13:36.253
Look, that is why

13:36.254 --> 13:39.273
we need to think this through, okay?

13:39.274 --> 13:42.293
- I don't want to push him away.
- So you're saying do nothing?

13:42.294 --> 13:44.183
No, I'm not saying we don't do anything.

13:44.184 --> 13:46.233
I'm saying we just let
him stew up in his room

13:46.234 --> 13:48.153
for a little bit, and
then we sit him down...

13:49.264 --> 13:51.133
Who's that?

13:51.134 --> 13:52.333
Okay, and then we have a talk,

13:52.334 --> 13:55.243
hear the whole story, hear
what he has to say for himself,

13:55.244 --> 13:58.304
and then you and I will
handle this together.

14:05.214 --> 14:06.293
Cal.

14:06.294 --> 14:08.323
Where are Freddie and Kerry Ridge?

14:08.324 --> 14:10.233
- In Cusco with Silas.
- Sarah...

14:10.234 --> 14:12.143
They're exactly where
they should be, Cal.

14:12.144 --> 14:13.203
I don't care where they should be.

14:13.204 --> 14:14.243
That boy was gonna end up dead.

14:14.244 --> 14:15.313
I ordered you not to do that.

14:15.314 --> 14:17.183
You might be okay with him dying

14:17.184 --> 14:19.173
with a needle in his arm, but I am not.

14:19.174 --> 14:21.283
You have no idea how
stupid a call that was.

14:21.284 --> 14:25.313
I think it's time for you to leave, Cal.

14:25.314 --> 14:28.233
Did I not make myself clear?

14:28.234 --> 14:30.153
This is my house.

14:30.154 --> 14:32.163
You don't talk to my
wife like that in my house

14:32.164 --> 14:34.243
or anywhere else, for that matter.

14:34.244 --> 14:37.333
Okay, yeah, you're right. I apologize.

14:37.334 --> 14:41.224
But you did mess this
up, Sarah. You really did.

15:04.144 --> 15:05.293
This is Silas. Send a pigeon.

15:07.214 --> 15:09.283
Silas, this is Cal. Call
me back A-S-A-fucking-P.

15:09.284 --> 15:11.283
I don't care what Sarah told you.

15:11.284 --> 15:13.264
Do not give Freddie Ridge the medicine.

15:30.304 --> 15:32.323
We did it...

15:32.324 --> 15:34.283
Sean and I, this morning.

15:34.284 --> 15:36.253
- Uh, this isn't a good time.
- But we had sex.

15:36.254 --> 15:38.173
You know, I understood what the "it" was

15:38.174 --> 15:39.263
you were referring to.

15:39.264 --> 15:41.223
Uh, hi.

15:41.224 --> 15:43.213
Yeah, I'd like to reserve
your first available flight

15:43.214 --> 15:46.163
from New York to Cusco,
Peru, departing Newark.

15:46.164 --> 15:49.133
Immediately.

15:49.134 --> 15:51.133
No, no, "first available" means

15:51.134 --> 15:52.203
I need it much sooner than that.

15:52.204 --> 15:53.223
What about, uh,

15:53.224 --> 15:54.253
uh, Newark to Phoenix,

15:54.254 --> 15:56.303
Phoenix...

15:56.304 --> 15:59.303
This is actually... this is
the worst possible time, Mary.

15:59.304 --> 16:01.163
Why don't you tell me?

16:01.164 --> 16:04.113
What is the fastest way I can get there?

16:04.114 --> 16:07.293
Please, close the door.

16:07.294 --> 16:09.233
No, no, you know what?

16:09.234 --> 16:11.213
No, that is not fast enough.

16:11.214 --> 16:14.144
Fuck!

17:14.263 --> 17:18.153
Hawk, it's important to us that you know

17:18.154 --> 17:19.203
that we're not mad.

17:19.204 --> 17:20.272
I'm mad.

17:20.273 --> 17:22.262
I'm furious.

17:22.263 --> 17:24.183
Well, we are not any more mad

17:24.184 --> 17:26.173
than we have every right to be.

17:26.174 --> 17:27.303
These people, this girl...

17:27.304 --> 17:30.163
she will try to destroy
everything good about you.

17:30.164 --> 17:31.223
Do you understand that?

17:31.224 --> 17:32.333
They're bringing The Future.

17:32.334 --> 17:34.313
- Sarah.
- No.

17:34.314 --> 17:37.253
This is all they care about...
themselves, the moment.

17:37.254 --> 17:39.193
Look, I'm sorry. I'll Offset.

17:39.194 --> 17:41.193
You can't just Offset and
go through the motions.

17:41.194 --> 17:42.313
You have to truly understand...

17:42.314 --> 17:44.143
Who is this girl?

17:44.144 --> 17:46.103
She's just a girl.

17:46.104 --> 17:47.263
Okay, what's her name?

17:47.264 --> 17:50.173
- Why does that matter?
- Ashley.

17:50.174 --> 17:52.193
Her name is Ashley.

17:52.194 --> 17:56.104
All right, well, how long
have you been seeing Ashley?

17:57.284 --> 17:59.334
A few weeks, maybe a month.

18:03.204 --> 18:04.283
Are you having sex?

18:04.284 --> 18:06.123
No.

18:06.124 --> 18:09.233
She invited me to a party,

18:09.234 --> 18:11.313
and I went, and we fell
asleep in the grass.

18:11.314 --> 18:13.274
Good.

18:18.194 --> 18:22.103
He will leave school on
Monday just like he wanted.

18:22.104 --> 18:24.143
He'll almost be 16.

18:24.144 --> 18:25.253
You can take your vows early.

18:25.254 --> 18:28.103
Sarah, I think we should...

18:28.104 --> 18:30.213
I don't want to leave school...

18:30.214 --> 18:33.123
at least not right now.

18:33.124 --> 18:34.263
Sarah.

18:34.264 --> 18:38.174
You will leave school when
you are 16, regardless.

18:46.324 --> 18:49.224
I'm... I'm sorry, Dad.

18:52.324 --> 18:56.153
Look, I just hope...

18:56.154 --> 18:59.263
that, uh, with all this stuff...

18:59.264 --> 19:02.253
all this stuff that's
been going on lately,

19:02.254 --> 19:04.243
all the stuff that I did...

19:04.244 --> 19:09.123
I just hope you're not making
these decisions because of...

19:09.124 --> 19:12.243
because of that, because of me.

19:12.244 --> 19:14.303
No.

19:14.304 --> 19:18.113
It doesn't have anything to do with you.

19:18.114 --> 19:20.203
Okay, good.

19:20.204 --> 19:25.104
I was always taught to
believe the IS were bad.

19:28.144 --> 19:31.213
Ashley doesn't seem...

19:31.214 --> 19:33.194
bad.

19:37.264 --> 19:39.324
Is she bad?

19:48.254 --> 19:52.163
She doesn't know what she is yet.

19:52.164 --> 19:56.293
Okay, she's, um...

19:56.294 --> 19:58.153
she's an Ignorant,

19:58.154 --> 20:00.313
and Ignorants either bring The Future,

20:00.314 --> 20:04.154
or they find The Light.

20:09.164 --> 20:12.113
Hold up, let me...
let me see March again,

20:12.114 --> 20:14.263
the joint ones... the Chase accounts.

20:14.264 --> 20:16.223
Chase. Jason and Alison Kemp.

20:16.224 --> 20:19.163
That's the solo account.
I need the joint one.

20:19.164 --> 20:21.113
Come on, man, open that back up.

20:21.114 --> 20:22.163
Goddamn.

20:22.164 --> 20:24.303
- March.
- All right, man, Jesus.

20:24.304 --> 20:28.103
All right, now the Delta
page. The other Delta page.

20:28.104 --> 20:30.133
- Seriously, man, are you okay?
- Yes, I'm okay.

20:30.134 --> 20:32.123
Beth said you had to take
your kid to the hospital.

20:32.124 --> 20:33.253
Is that what she said?

20:33.254 --> 20:35.163
'Cause she's not supposed to give out

20:35.164 --> 20:36.263
- my personal information.
- No, don't be mad.

20:36.264 --> 20:38.183
She's the best secretary we've had.

20:38.184 --> 20:40.303
I'm just saying, if you
need to talk, my priest is...

20:40.304 --> 20:42.183
Your priest?

20:42.184 --> 20:44.193
You knew I converted.

20:44.194 --> 20:46.143
Uh, yeah, yeah, I heard.

20:46.144 --> 20:48.204
Your fiancée, right?

20:50.114 --> 20:51.163
Check it out.

20:51.164 --> 20:52.323
Lima, Lima, Lima.

20:52.324 --> 20:54.243
That's a lot of Limas.

20:54.244 --> 20:57.103
That sure is, and that's
within a two-week span.

20:57.104 --> 20:58.183
That's just in March.

20:58.184 --> 21:00.143
It's 11 Limas in 3 months.

21:00.144 --> 21:02.143
In his final 3 months.

21:02.144 --> 21:04.283
Open up our backlog
and add all the Limas.

21:04.284 --> 21:07.323
Shit, that's a lot of moving around.

21:07.324 --> 21:09.133
With his checking accounts

21:09.134 --> 21:10.233
inflating and deflating radically

21:10.234 --> 21:12.113
over that same period of time.

21:12.114 --> 21:14.163
Feels like trafficking
to me, doesn't it?

21:14.164 --> 21:16.123
Feels exactly like trafficking.

21:16.124 --> 21:17.223
Huh.

21:17.224 --> 21:18.313
I'm just saying,

21:18.314 --> 21:20.313
my priest is really great to talk to,

21:20.314 --> 21:23.153
and, you know, he doesn't care

21:23.154 --> 21:25.294
if you're not, you know, Catholic.

21:47.244 --> 21:48.274
Sarah.

21:57.124 --> 21:59.334
Sorry, sorry. I didn't
mean to disturb you.

22:02.204 --> 22:04.283
Looks like you're deep.

22:04.284 --> 22:07.243
I am.

22:07.244 --> 22:08.314
I was.

22:10.284 --> 22:14.333
Um, I just...

22:14.334 --> 22:19.113
wanted to apologize for yesterday.

22:19.114 --> 22:20.323
I was angry.

22:20.324 --> 22:23.143
I-I-I
am angry,

22:23.144 --> 22:26.283
but you deserve more
respect than I gave you.

22:26.284 --> 22:29.174
I shouldn't have
shouted at you like that.

22:35.214 --> 22:38.163
You okay?

22:38.164 --> 22:41.173
No.

22:41.174 --> 22:43.303
What is it, if I may?

22:43.304 --> 22:46.104
Hawk...

22:48.164 --> 22:50.104
And an IS girl.

22:52.294 --> 22:54.323
He says he doesn't want to leave school.

22:54.324 --> 22:59.153
It's exactly what had
happened with Tessa.

22:59.154 --> 23:00.193
You remember?

23:00.194 --> 23:03.113
She was almost 16,

23:03.114 --> 23:05.114
ready to take her vows.

23:10.234 --> 23:12.294
What if he leaves us?

23:14.324 --> 23:17.283
I mean, what if he...

23:17.284 --> 23:19.264
he chooses to be Ignorant?

23:21.154 --> 23:24.224
The Garden without Hawk...

23:40.124 --> 23:42.204
Let me pray with you...

23:44.284 --> 23:46.304
For Hawk.

24:17.274 --> 24:21.253
7, 15, 12, 32, 54,

24:21.254 --> 24:24.133
76, 94, 115.

24:24.134 --> 24:25.163
First combination backwards.

24:25.164 --> 24:28.193
115, 94, 76,

24:28.194 --> 24:31.293
54, 30, uh...

24:31.294 --> 24:34.123
30-something. Shit.

24:34.124 --> 24:36.303
Once you know the
words, the code forwards,

24:36.304 --> 24:40.243
backwards, in detail, it's
in every cell of your body.

24:40.244 --> 24:43.143
You live with the doors unlocked.

24:43.144 --> 24:49.273
7, 15, 12, 32, 54, 76.

24:49.274 --> 24:52.153
76, 76... fuck!

24:52.154 --> 24:54.303
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck. Fuck!

24:54.304 --> 24:57.133
Fuck, 76... shit, man.

24:57.134 --> 25:00.103
Um, 94.

25:00.104 --> 25:02.133
Uh, fuck me.

25:02.134 --> 25:04.153
Point is to free yourself

25:04.154 --> 25:06.163
of delusion, not turn
you into a drunken sailor.

25:06.164 --> 25:08.193
- Let's take a break.
- I don't need a break.

25:08.194 --> 25:10.153
- Let's just keep going.
- No, no, break.

25:10.154 --> 25:12.323
Seriously, it's okay. It's okay.

25:17.154 --> 25:21.103
I know it seems impenetrable,
but, uh, one day...

25:21.104 --> 25:23.133
It'll happen.

25:23.134 --> 25:24.274
You'll know it.

25:26.324 --> 25:30.173
You'll understand what it is
to live with the words embedded

25:30.174 --> 25:33.133
and that glorious sense
of freedom you feel

25:33.134 --> 25:36.133
when those doors are unchained.

25:36.134 --> 25:37.253
Hmm?

25:37.254 --> 25:40.234
Yeah.

25:46.144 --> 25:50.204
So may I ask what you found in the hole?

25:53.314 --> 25:56.253
Um...

25:56.254 --> 25:59.313
nothing.

25:59.314 --> 26:01.303
Well, I don't believe that for a second.

26:01.304 --> 26:04.163
What'd you find?

26:04.164 --> 26:06.114
You mean when I dug a long time ago?

26:08.194 --> 26:12.203
Well, I, um...

26:12.204 --> 26:15.113
I had a vision...

26:15.114 --> 26:17.154
that I was...

26:20.114 --> 26:23.173
A no one...

26:23.174 --> 26:25.204
a nothing.

26:27.254 --> 26:29.243
I guess that's a fear
a lot of people have...

26:29.244 --> 26:32.183
that their lives are
totally unimportant.

26:32.184 --> 26:33.243
You know what?

26:33.244 --> 26:36.103
I actually do not have that fear.

26:36.104 --> 26:39.213
No, I know you don't.

26:39.214 --> 26:42.223
I've always envied that about you.

26:42.224 --> 26:45.173
Oh, yeah? You envy something about me?

26:45.174 --> 26:46.313
Yeah.

26:46.314 --> 26:49.273
I do, Eddie.

26:49.274 --> 26:51.144
More than one thing.

26:55.324 --> 26:58.103
Your turn. What'd you find?

26:58.104 --> 27:00.323
Actually, I, uh...

27:00.324 --> 27:03.283
I saw you, Cal.

27:03.284 --> 27:04.333
Me?

27:04.334 --> 27:06.273
Yeah.

27:06.274 --> 27:09.183
What was I doing?

27:09.184 --> 27:13.253
You were yelling at my wife...

27:13.254 --> 27:16.113
about Freddie Ridge,

27:16.114 --> 27:18.203
and then it happened a few hours later,

27:18.204 --> 27:21.194
which was kind of weird.

27:25.184 --> 27:26.283
I am sorry about that.

27:26.284 --> 27:29.163
I shouldn't have behaved that way.

27:29.164 --> 27:32.283
I was... I was pretty pissed, though.

27:32.284 --> 27:36.223
Yeah, but still, you're
supposed to have self-control.

27:36.224 --> 27:40.243
I mean, 10R.

27:44.154 --> 27:47.283
Well, luckily, Sarah
and I have talked since.

27:47.284 --> 27:49.223
You have?

27:49.224 --> 27:51.333
- Did you apologize?
- I did.

27:51.334 --> 27:54.143
I mean, if I had any idea

27:54.144 --> 27:56.243
what was happening in
your house with Hawk,

27:56.244 --> 27:57.263
I-I would never.

27:57.264 --> 28:00.203
Mm.

28:00.204 --> 28:02.293
Luckily we prayed about it...

28:02.294 --> 28:04.264
together.

28:07.124 --> 28:10.123
That's good.

28:10.124 --> 28:11.264
Thank you.

28:14.294 --> 28:17.293
You know what? I, uh... I get it.

28:17.294 --> 28:19.183
I do.

28:19.184 --> 28:22.163
I mean, you're in a
bureaucratic position.

28:22.164 --> 28:24.203
Ridge could be a big donor.

28:24.204 --> 28:27.293
It's no surprise you
were a little rattled.

28:27.294 --> 28:30.193
I mean, someone around here
has to worry about money.

28:30.194 --> 28:32.234
Mm.

28:38.224 --> 28:41.104
- Mary, are you in there?
- What?

28:43.114 --> 28:44.113
What are you doing?

28:44.114 --> 28:45.233
- Going.
- Where?

28:45.234 --> 28:47.323
I don't know yet. Somewhere new.

28:47.324 --> 28:49.333
- D.C., maybe.
- Why?

28:49.334 --> 28:52.183
- Doesn't matter.
- It does.

28:52.184 --> 28:54.163
It should.

28:54.164 --> 28:57.283
Was it because we...
because of the other day?

28:57.284 --> 28:59.213
Did I make you feel like
you had to do something

28:59.214 --> 29:01.123
you didn't want to?

29:01.124 --> 29:03.263
It has nothing to do with
you or us or the other day.

29:03.264 --> 29:06.323
I just... I don't belong here.

29:06.324 --> 29:08.203
Yes, you do.

29:08.204 --> 29:10.163
No, I don't. I'm not...

29:10.164 --> 29:11.273
What?

29:11.274 --> 29:13.283
Like you. Like them.

29:13.284 --> 29:16.193
I'm not like them either.

29:16.194 --> 29:19.163
We're just all different
with all different stories

29:19.164 --> 29:21.243
looking for a better world,

29:21.244 --> 29:23.333
'cause the world out there, it's...

29:23.334 --> 29:26.113
I mean, it's all the same.

29:26.114 --> 29:27.183
You go to sleep. You wake up.

29:27.184 --> 29:29.223
You have a day, a nice enough day.

29:29.224 --> 29:31.303
You go to sleep, wake up, same thing,

29:31.304 --> 29:34.133
and then with no warning, the next day

29:34.134 --> 29:37.133
someone shoots your sister
right in front of you

29:37.134 --> 29:39.223
and four of your friends...

29:39.224 --> 29:42.173
third period, Mr.
Reimers' biology class,

29:42.174 --> 29:45.293
because of the color of their skin.

29:45.294 --> 29:47.173
"Aunt Jemima bitch"...

29:47.174 --> 29:48.323
That was the last thing
that Sheila ever heard,

29:48.324 --> 29:51.143
and that, that is the rest of the world.

29:51.144 --> 29:52.243
It is all the same.

29:52.244 --> 29:54.293
It feeds on lies and hate,

29:54.294 --> 29:56.313
but here there is not that world.

29:56.314 --> 29:59.253
Here there is only this world,

29:59.254 --> 30:03.104
and I want you in it with me.

30:08.274 --> 30:11.163
I understand, Dr. Woodruff.

30:11.164 --> 30:13.123
You'll talk us through
it on Monday, all right.

30:13.124 --> 30:16.253
Excuse me, Abe.

30:16.254 --> 30:18.193
No, no, no.

30:18.194 --> 30:22.283
I promise we won't do
any online research, okay?

30:22.284 --> 30:25.103
All right, thanks. Yeah?

30:25.104 --> 30:27.183
There's a Mr. Cox waiting for you.

30:27.184 --> 30:28.273
Hey.

30:28.274 --> 30:30.303
Mr. Cox, I told you
to wait in reception.

30:30.304 --> 30:33.284
Beth, Beth, it's... it's okay.

30:35.314 --> 30:37.223
Mr. Cox.

30:37.224 --> 30:40.253
Hey, I, uh, was near here

30:40.254 --> 30:42.133
getting my prescription re-upped.

30:42.134 --> 30:44.273
Thought I'd swing by, touch base,

30:44.274 --> 30:48.123
'cause I'm really
concerned about my daughter.

30:48.124 --> 30:49.273
What's the latest?

30:49.274 --> 30:52.193
We have a full-fledged
investigation going on.

30:52.194 --> 30:54.163
Yeah.

30:54.164 --> 30:56.183
Yeah, well, where are
the loonies that took her?

30:56.184 --> 30:58.253
I mean, where is their bunker

30:58.254 --> 31:02.163
or their circus tents or whatever?

31:02.164 --> 31:04.223
We're working day and night.

31:04.224 --> 31:06.183
I promise you that.

31:06.184 --> 31:09.293
What do you know so far?

31:09.294 --> 31:14.163
We know a hell of a lot more
than we knew a few days ago,

31:14.164 --> 31:18.213
and when we're ready to
act on it, I promise you,

31:18.214 --> 31:21.193
you will be the first person I call.

31:21.194 --> 31:22.224
Please.

31:51.294 --> 31:53.273
How was your day?

31:53.274 --> 31:56.104
I didn't see her, if
that's what you're asking.

32:02.104 --> 32:03.253
I don't want to do this, Mom.

32:03.254 --> 32:07.124
I want to tell you a story.

32:17.214 --> 32:21.223
Close your eyes.

32:21.224 --> 32:23.313
I was six weeks pregnant

32:23.314 --> 32:27.103
when I had a feeling
something was wrong.

32:27.104 --> 32:31.213
I was about to go to Peru,
so I went to the doctor.

32:31.214 --> 32:33.313
There was no heartbeat.

32:33.314 --> 32:35.294
I'd lost the baby.

32:38.244 --> 32:40.213
I was devastated.

32:43.194 --> 32:46.294
I had to wait for the baby
to miscarry, so I went...

32:48.214 --> 32:50.244
I went to Peru.

I won't lose you again.

34:44.254 --> 34:47.324
- Hey.
- Hey.

34:49.313 --> 34:51.263
What's going on?

34:51.264 --> 34:53.213
Nothing.

34:53.214 --> 34:55.143
Well, you're avoiding me.

34:55.143 --> 34:57.253
I just... I-I've been thinking a lot,

34:57.254 --> 35:01.114
and I-I don't want to
hang out anymore with you.

35:04.264 --> 35:05.323
Wait. You don't...

35:05.324 --> 35:09.233
Wait, Hawk. What are you doing?

35:09.234 --> 35:11.203
You have to tell me why you
don't want to see me anymore.

35:11.204 --> 35:14.233
What, is it because of
your parents, your religion?

35:14.234 --> 35:16.133
'Cause if it is, you're an idiot.

35:16.134 --> 35:17.233
A religion that tells you

35:17.234 --> 35:19.113
who you can and can't like is stupid,

35:19.114 --> 35:20.253
and I know that you like me, Hawk.

35:20.254 --> 35:22.134
I know you do.

35:35.324 --> 35:38.334
So I'm thinking about doing it.

35:40.324 --> 35:43.253
You know, 1R or whatever.

35:43.254 --> 35:45.183
You know, first rung.

35:45.184 --> 35:47.143
Okay.

35:47.144 --> 35:49.303
So what do I have to do?

35:49.304 --> 35:51.284
I have to give you money or what?

35:53.214 --> 35:56.273
You're not hungry?

35:56.274 --> 35:59.113
Yeah.

35:59.114 --> 36:03.103
No, I-I just... I...

36:03.104 --> 36:07.163
I don't have a appetite
for some reason, you know.

36:07.164 --> 36:10.263
What's going on, Sam?

36:10.264 --> 36:12.123
Nothing.

36:12.124 --> 36:15.113
Nothing much, I just...

36:15.114 --> 36:17.203
you know, just having these thoughts.

36:17.204 --> 36:21.203
You know, just feeling, um...

36:21.204 --> 36:23.103
feeling at sea.

36:23.104 --> 36:25.123
So I thought if I get
on The Ladder, you know,

36:25.124 --> 36:26.303
I'd just... it would...

36:26.304 --> 36:29.143
Well, any idea what's
making you feel that way?

36:29.144 --> 36:30.223
It's my daughter.

36:30.224 --> 36:32.133
Little girl?

36:32.134 --> 36:33.303
Yeah.

36:33.304 --> 36:36.143
What is it?

36:36.144 --> 36:37.183
She's sick.

36:37.184 --> 36:41.283
Patent ductus arteriosus.

36:41.284 --> 36:45.273
It's like, a vessel is supposed to close

36:45.274 --> 36:50.173
after birth, and Lucy's didn't.

36:50.174 --> 36:54.233
So it's putting a strain on her lungs.

36:54.234 --> 36:59.113
She's wheezing a lot, and, um...

36:59.114 --> 37:01.243
She's so very uncomfortable.

37:01.244 --> 37:05.133
I don't know how much longer...

37:05.134 --> 37:08.243
The doctor's gonna talk
us through it next week.

37:08.244 --> 37:10.293
Hey, but I've been online, man, and...

37:10.294 --> 37:14.103
and she might have to have
open-heart fucking surgery,

37:14.104 --> 37:16.123
and I don't know if
I can take that shit.

37:19.204 --> 37:21.233
Look...

37:21.234 --> 37:23.103
Hey.

37:23.104 --> 37:25.113
You don't know anything yet, right?

37:25.114 --> 37:26.163
Yeah, I...

37:26.164 --> 37:29.113
I mean, you don't know shit.

37:29.114 --> 37:30.323
I mean, don't get me wrong.

37:30.324 --> 37:33.273
I'd be fucking terrified, too,
but this is the worst part...

37:33.274 --> 37:35.223
I mean, not knowing.

37:35.224 --> 37:39.123
I mean, not knowing is, uh... it's fear.

37:39.124 --> 37:42.213
You know, it's... it's an abyss.

37:42.214 --> 37:44.313
So don't get caught
up in it, Sam, and...

37:44.314 --> 37:46.253
'cause it will destroy you.

37:46.254 --> 37:49.143
I mean, fear is worse

37:49.144 --> 37:52.153
than the worst thing happening.

37:52.154 --> 37:56.283
So, yeah, I mean,
getting on The Ladder...

37:56.284 --> 37:58.233
might help,

37:58.234 --> 38:02.254
but it's not gonna change
whether your kid is sick or not.

38:35.164 --> 38:37.284
You're home early.

38:40.144 --> 38:43.123
I was thinking I'd plant
trees for my Offset.

38:43.124 --> 38:45.274
That's a great idea.

38:49.124 --> 38:51.313
I'm sorry, Mom.

38:51.314 --> 38:53.303
I am.

38:53.304 --> 38:56.284
I know it must be hard.

39:14.334 --> 39:16.173
Peru.

39:16.174 --> 39:18.183
Your wife and son are in Peru.

39:18.184 --> 39:20.113
Tell me something I don't already know.

39:20.114 --> 39:22.113
Look, I didn't condone this happening,

39:22.114 --> 39:24.213
but your son is over 18,

39:24.214 --> 39:26.173
and he and your wife made a decision.

39:26.174 --> 39:27.263
My son's a fucking junkie,

39:27.264 --> 39:30.253
and my wife is a desperate woman,

39:30.254 --> 39:32.173
but then you know that.

39:32.174 --> 39:34.134
You prey on people like that.

39:36.174 --> 39:40.103
You asked us for help,
and my colleague made

39:40.104 --> 39:42.123
the recommendation she
thought best for your son.

39:42.124 --> 39:43.153
Your colleague?

39:43.154 --> 39:45.183
Are you a lawyer or something?

39:45.184 --> 39:47.183
You own a brokerage
house? Your colleague?

39:47.184 --> 39:49.123
You mean your follower,

39:49.124 --> 39:52.133
your disciple, your brainwashed weirdo?

39:52.134 --> 39:56.253
My colleague is
anything but brainwashed,

39:56.254 --> 39:59.213
and, in fact, no, she
went against my orders

39:59.214 --> 40:02.223
because... because she actually...

40:02.224 --> 40:04.223
she actually gives a shit, all right?

40:04.224 --> 40:07.193
And she believes that someone
as fucked up as your son

40:07.194 --> 40:10.213
is capable of real
change and transformation.

40:10.214 --> 40:12.223
My colleague...

40:12.224 --> 40:14.323
is a fucking angel,

40:14.324 --> 40:17.243
and you are lucky your
son crossed paths with her.

40:17.244 --> 40:19.214
Get the fuck out of my house!

40:24.124 --> 40:27.323
I predict that when they
come back in a few days,

40:27.324 --> 40:32.133
they'll be better off
than when they left...
