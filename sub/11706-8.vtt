WEBVTT

00:02.335 --> 00:03.628
{\an8}- I HAD A REASON TO [bleep] ON
YOU IN MIAMI.

00:03.711 --> 00:04.754
{\an8}REALIZE THAT.

00:04.838 --> 00:06.256
{\an8}SO KNOW WE'RE DONE.
LEAVE IT AT THAT.

00:06.339 --> 00:08.258
{\an8}I [bleep] UP
SIX MONTHS AGO,

00:08.341 --> 00:09.426
{\an8}AND I'M DONE PAYING FOR IT.

00:09.509 --> 00:11.094
{\an8}WATCH HOW [bleep]
STUPID I GET.

00:11.177 --> 00:12.721
{\an8}I GOT THE SMUSH ROOM TONIGHT!

00:12.804 --> 00:14.723
{\an8}- HE WANTS TO PLAY THAT
DIRTY GAME WITH YOU,

00:14.806 --> 00:16.725
{\an8}WE CAN PLAY IT
TEN TIMES AS HARD.

00:16.808 --> 00:19.811
{\an8}- I'M GOING TO GET RON BACK
THE BEST WAY I KNOW HOW.

00:19.894 --> 00:23.231
{\an8}I NEED A [bleep] HOT GUY
RIGHT NOW!

00:23.314 --> 00:25.775
{\an8}- SHE ACTUALLY HAD THE BALLS
TO DANCE WITH ANOTHER GUY.

00:25.859 --> 00:27.902
{\an8}I WANNA [bleep]
WRING YOUR NECK RIGHT NOW.

00:27.986 --> 00:31.740
{\an8}- EVERYTHING IS BROKEN
AND RUINED.

00:31.823 --> 00:32.866
{\an8}I JUST NEEDED
TO GET OUT OF HERE.

00:32.949 --> 00:35.034
{\an8}- WHEN ARE YOU LEAVING?
- LIKE NOW.

00:43.168 --> 00:44.627
{\an8}- LOOK WHAT WE DO
TO EACH OTHER.

00:49.466 --> 00:51.468
{\an8}I CAN'T DO THIS ANYMORE.

00:51.551 --> 00:54.471
{\an8}- LOOK, IF YOU WANNA GO HOME,
I'M GONNA LET YOU GO.

00:54.554 --> 00:57.056
{\an8}AS MUCH AS IT
[bleep] KILLS ME...

01:00.143 --> 01:03.146
{\an8}- I NEED TO GO HOME
AND SEE MY FAMILY

01:03.229 --> 01:05.648
{\an8}AND GET OUT OF THIS RELATIONSHIP
THAT I'VE BEEN IN.

01:05.732 --> 01:06.858
{\an8}I NEED TO GET OUT OF IT.

01:16.701 --> 01:17.160
{\an8}- [bleep], BRO.

01:20.663 --> 01:22.457
{\an8}I'M STILL SHOCKED
THAT SAM ACTUALLY IS LEAVING.

01:22.540 --> 01:27.128
{\an8}YOU KNOW WHAT, I NEVER THOUGHT
THAT SHE'D ACTUALLY LEAVE.

01:27.212 --> 01:29.506
{\an8}I DON'T KNOW HOW TO PICK MYSELF
UP FROM THE HOLE THAT I'VE...

01:29.589 --> 01:32.133
{\an8}DUG MYSELF INTO.

01:37.096 --> 01:40.141
{\an8}I'VE [bleep] MYSELF
IN SO MANY WAYS.

01:40.225 --> 01:42.227
{\an8}I CAN'T EVEN LOOK AT MYSELF
IN THE MIRROR AT THIS POINT.

01:45.522 --> 01:46.856
{\an8}- COME ON, BIG DOG.

01:46.940 --> 01:49.192
{\an8}LET ME CHILL WITH YOU.

01:49.275 --> 01:51.361
{\an8}I'M GONNA CHILL WITH YOU,
BIG DOG.

01:51.444 --> 01:52.529
{\an8}- [sobbing]
- IT'S GOOD.

01:52.612 --> 01:53.780
{\an8}IT'S GOOD TO [bleep]
CRY, DOG.

01:53.863 --> 01:54.614
{\an8}YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
IT'S ALL GOOD.

01:54.697 --> 01:56.115
{\an8}YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

01:56.199 --> 01:57.367
{\an8}THINK ABOUT WHAT'S
GOING ON IN YOUR LIFE.

01:57.450 --> 01:58.868
{\an8}YOU GOT A LOT
OF GOOD THINGS, MAN.

01:58.952 --> 02:00.620
{\an8}- SHE WAS A GOOD THING,
THOUGH, BRO.

02:00.703 --> 02:02.205
{\an8}- I KNOW SHE'S
A GOOD THING, TOO,

02:02.288 --> 02:03.248
{\an8}BUT IT WORKS OUT, MAN.

02:03.331 --> 02:05.458
{\an8}YOU'LL BE ALL RIGHT.
I GOT YOUR BACK.

02:05.542 --> 02:07.210
{\an8}HERE, WALK AROUND.

02:07.293 --> 02:08.877
{\an8}YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?
WALK AROUND.

02:08.961 --> 02:10.880
{\an8}YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
JUST DO SOMETHING.

02:10.964 --> 02:12.549
{\an8}SOME DAYS,
I'M UNCLE SITUATION.

02:12.632 --> 02:14.634
{\an8}OTHER DAYS,
I'M DR. SITUATION.

02:14.717 --> 02:16.177

{\an8}A PRETTY DEEP DUDE.

02:21.391 --> 02:23.393
{\an8}YOU DO RONNIE.
YOU TAKE CARE OF RONNIE.

02:23.476 --> 02:25.645
{\an8}YOU GO TO THE GYM.
LISTEN TO MUSIC, VIBE OUT.

02:25.728 --> 02:27.146
{\an8}YOU KNOW, THAT'S WHAT
WE'RE GONNA DO.

02:27.230 --> 02:28.356
{\an8}I'M GOOD AS HELL WHEN IT COMES
TO RELATIONSHIPS, MAN.

02:28.439 --> 02:32.819
{\an8}- LISTENING TO MIKE ABOUT
RELATIONSHIP PROBLEMS

02:32.902 --> 02:35.321
{\an8}IS LIKE LISTENING TO A SAILOR
ABOUT FLYING A PLANE.

02:35.405 --> 02:36.990
{\an8}- LIFE GOES ON, MAN,
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

02:37.073 --> 02:40.076
{\an8}NO MATTER WHAT.
TIME KEEPS TICKING.

02:40.159 --> 02:42.662
{\an8}AND IF YOU DON'T KEEP GOING,
YOU GET LEFT BEHIND.

02:42.745 --> 02:44.038
{\an8}YOU KNOW, IF IT'S MEANT TO BE,
IT'S MEANT TO BE.

02:44.122 --> 02:46.541
{\an8}LIFE'S NOT COOKIE CUTTER.

02:46.624 --> 02:49.669
{\an8}I'D RATHER DIE STANDING
THAN LIVE ON MY KNEES.

02:49.752 --> 02:51.921
{\an8}YOU KNOW?
THAT'S A [bleep] GOOD ONE.

02:52.005 --> 02:54.883
{\an8}[laughing]
THAT'S A GOOD ONE.

02:54.966 --> 02:56.593
{\an8}I MEAN, WHAT AM I GONNA
SAY TO HIM, YOU KNOW?

02:56.676 --> 02:59.262
{\an8}I COULD JUST TELL HIM TO PUT ON
A LITTLE MICHAEL BOLTON.

02:59.345 --> 03:01.347
{\an8}HERE. COME ON, YOU'RE
GONNA BE ALL RIGHT.

03:01.431 --> 03:02.682
{\an8}A LITTLE
FETAL POSITION ACTION.

03:02.765 --> 03:04.434
{\an8}[bleep], HE'LL BE OKAY.

03:04.517 --> 03:07.145
{\an8}BUT SAM'S NOT COMING BACK
THIS SUMMER.

03:24.704 --> 03:27.457
{\an8}- I MISSED YOU.

03:27.540 --> 03:30.960
{\an8}I HAVE NEVER BEEN SO HURT
IN MY ENTIRE LIFE.

03:31.044 --> 03:33.463
{\an8}I'M DESTROYED RIGHT NOW,
AND THE BEST THING FOR ME TO DO

03:33.546 --> 03:35.214
{\an8}IS, YOU KNOW, GO HOME
AND HUG MY MOM.

03:35.298 --> 03:37.926
{\an8}AND JUST SIT DOWN IN,
LIKE, A QUIET HOUSE

03:38.009 --> 03:39.177
{\an8}AND JUST FEEL BETTER
ABOUT MYSELF.

03:39.260 --> 03:41.471
{\an8}- PRETTY MUCH, I GOT
IN A FIGHT WITH RON,

03:41.554 --> 03:44.432
{\an8}AND ALL MY STUFF
WAS DESTROYED.

03:44.515 --> 03:45.808
{\an8}- WHAT DO YOU MEAN, DESTROYED?
WHAT KIND OF A FIGHT?

03:45.892 --> 03:47.018
{\an8}- LIKE, MY GLASSES ARE BROKE.

03:47.101 --> 03:48.811
{\an8}ALL--SUNGLASSES RUINED.

03:48.895 --> 03:50.104

{\an8}- OH, I'M NOT LIKING THAT

03:58.529 --> 03:59.822
{\an8}- I HAVE NO GLASSES
RIGHT NOW.

03:59.906 --> 04:01.658
{\an8}MENTALLY, LIKE, I FEEL
LIKE I'VE BEEN ABUSED.

04:01.741 --> 04:04.243
{\an8}- AND I'M GONNA HAVE THREE GIRLS

IN MIAMI!

04:11.250 --> 04:12.669
{\an8}- I'M NOT HEALTHY,
AND THAT'S WHY I'M HERE.

04:12.752 --> 04:14.295
{\an8}- NO, YOU'RE NOT, AND--

04:14.379 --> 04:16.339
{\an8}YOU'RE NOT HEALTHY, AND THAT'S
NOT A HEALTHY RELATIONSHIP.

04:16.422 --> 04:17.923
{\an8}LOVING SOMEBODY, YOU DON'T

04:18.007 --> 04:19.175
{\an8}THAT'S RIGHT.

04:19.257 --> 04:22.929
{\an8}- THERE'S NO HAPPINESS
THAT'S NOT MEANT TO BE.

16:22.731 --> 16:23.732
{\an8}- HEY, IF HE'S CRYING
IN THE CORNER,

16:23.816 --> 16:26.276
{\an8}THAT PRETTY MUCH
IS GONNA BE

16:26.360 --> 16:27.569
{\an8}OUR [bleep] BLOCK
THE WHOLE NIGHT.

16:27.653 --> 16:29.530
{\an8}- WE DON'T HAVE SINGLE RONNIE
RIGHT NOW.

16:29.613 --> 16:31.073
{\an8}- SO WE LOST BOTH.
- YEAH.

16:31.156 --> 16:32.741
{\an8}- SO THERE'S NO POINT.
- THAT'S THE WAY I LOOK AT IT.

16:32.825 --> 16:34.743
{\an8}- RON IS JUST REALLY
[bleep] UP RIGHT NOW.

16:34.827 --> 16:36.120
{\an8}AND WE NEEDED
TO COME TOGETHER

16:36.203 --> 16:39.039

{\an8}- HE'S HURTING.

16:49.007 --> 16:51.135
{\an8}HE SHOULD FEEL
LIKE SHE'S GONE.

16:51.218 --> 16:54.638
{\an8}- WE DECIDED TO MOVE
SAM'S STUFF DOWN TO OUR ROOM,

16:54.722 --> 16:56.598

TO SEE ALL HER [bleep]

16:56.682 --> 16:58.308

{\an8}AND I CAN'T DO IT,
'CAUSE SHE'S NOT IN THE HOUSE,

17:31.717 --> 17:34.303
{\an8}AND I DON'T WANT TO CALL HER,
SO...I SEND HER FLOWERS,

17:34.386 --> 17:35.679

17:45.898 --> 17:47.316
{\an8}- ALL THREE.

17:47.399 --> 17:48.859

17:57.868 --> 17:59.036
{\an8}THE KEYS ARE RIGHT THERE.

17:59.119 --> 18:02.706
{\an8}- THE BOYS HAVE TO PHYSICALLY
TAKE RONNIE

18:02.790 --> 18:04.333
{\an8}AND MOVE HIM
OUT OF THE HOUSE

18:04.416 --> 18:06.502
{\an8}SO THE GIRLS
CAN DO THEIR THING.

18:10.506 --> 18:11.799

18:11.882 --> 18:13.383
{\an8}- WHERE CAN WE STORE IT?

18:13.467 --> 18:16.929
{\an8}- WE DECIDE TO MOVE SAM'S STUFF

18:17.012 --> 18:17.888
{\an8}BECAUSE, IF SHE COMES BACK,

18:17.971 --> 18:20.724

18:53.298 --> 18:55.008
{\an8}AT THIS PARTICULAR TIME,
I'M HOLDING UP RONNIE,

{\an8}- I GOTTA GET
MY EYEBROWS DONE, MAN.

{\an8}IT'S A PROCESS TO BE

19:02.641 --> 19:03.767
{\an8}NOT EVERYBODY CAN DO IT.

{\an8}WE PLAN ON TAKING
AS LONG AS WE CAN

19:10.774 --> 19:12.568
{\an8}JUST TO KEEP RONNIE
OUT OF THE HOUSE.

{\an8}AND THEN SUBMARINE.

19:17.781 --> 19:20.033
{\an8}AFTER THE SUBMARINE,
THERE'S THE TANK.

19:20.117 --> 19:21.368
{\an8}- THEN THERE'S THE SCUD,
RIGHT?

19:21.451 --> 19:22.744
{\an8}- AND THEN, AFTER THE TANK,
IT'S THE A-BOMB.

19:25.831 --> 19:27.583
{\an8}- WHEN HE ASKS WHERE
DID ALL HER STUFF GO,

19:27.666 --> 19:28.125
{\an8}SHOULD WE JUST SAY...

19:28.208 --> 19:30.419
{\an8}- I DON'T KNOW.

19:30.502 --> 19:31.503
{\an8}THAT'S WHY I WANT TO HURRY,

19:31.587 --> 19:34.506
{\an8}BECAUSE THEY'RE GONNA
BE HOME SOON.

19:42.180 --> 19:44.182

20:07.831 --> 20:09.541

20:18.550 --> 20:19.968
{\an8}- UH, WHEN I GET BACK
FROM MY HAIRCUT,

20:20.052 --> 20:21.219

{\an8}I'M LIKE, "[bleep],

20:31.313 --> 20:34.942
{\an8}SHE FORGOT
THE REST OF HER STUFF.

20:35.025 --> 20:36.777
{\an8}THAT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.

20:36.860 --> 20:38.654
{\an8}EITHER SHE CAME HOME
WHILE NOBODY WAS HOME

20:38.737 --> 20:41.073
{\an8}AND GOT HER STUFF
AND SHE'S NOT COMING BACK,

20:41.156 --> 20:42.658

38:07.076 --> 38:09.870
{\an8}- I THINK MIKE WILL TRY
TO LOOK FOR LEFTOVERS.

38:09.954 --> 38:11.580
{\an8}I THINK HE'S REALLY WAITING
FOR ME TO ASK HIM,

38:11.664 --> 38:13.124
{\an8}"HERE, MIKE, YOU WANNA
GIVE HER A GO?"

38:13.207 --> 38:14.041
{\an8}[laughs] YOU KNOW.

38:14.125 --> 38:15.126
{\an8}- HAVE YOUR GIRL TAKE A BITE.

38:15.209 --> 38:16.377
{\an8}- [laughing] NO!

38:16.460 --> 38:17.712
{\an8}- JUST ONE FULL BITE

38:17.795 --> 38:18.838
{\an8}ONE FULL BITE AND I'LL LEAVE,

38:18.921 --> 38:20.047
{\an8}TAKE A BIG JOINT.

38:20.131 --> 38:21.048
{\an8}THERE WE GO.

38:22.633 --> 38:24.385
{\an8}- LITTLE PICKLE.
I'LL LEAVE IN A SEC.

38:24.468 --> 38:25.386
{\an8}TAKE MORE PICKLE.

38:25.469 --> 38:26.012
{\an8}THERE YOU GO, BIG DOG.

38:31.767 --> 38:33.936
{\an8}- OH.

38:42.820 --> 38:45.364
{\an8}- YOU OKAY?

38:45.448 --> 38:47.992
{\an8}I FEEL BAD FOR RONNIE,
'CAUSE YOU COULD TELL

38:48.075 --> 38:49.785
{\an8}HE'S, LIKE, DISTRAUGHT.

38:49.869 --> 38:52.663
{\an8}I DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE
GONNA BE LIKE THIS.

38:52.747 --> 38:54.373
{\an8}I'M GONNA TELL YOU.

38:54.457 --> 38:55.041
{\an8}WE MOVED HER STUFF.

38:55.124 --> 38:57.335
{\an8}HER STUFF IS DOWNSTAIRS.

38:57.418 --> 38:59.003
{\an8}I REALLY DO LIKE RONNIE
AS A PERSON.

38:59.086 --> 39:01.213
{\an8}AND I FELT BAD LYING TO HIM.

39:01.297 --> 39:03.591
{\an8}I FELT BAD KIND OF
BETRAYING HIM.

39:03.674 --> 39:05.051
{\an8}WE FIGURED,
"YOU KNOW WHAT?

39:05.134 --> 39:08.095
{\an8}"LET'S JUST BRING HER STUFF
DOWNSTAIRS BECAUSE..."

39:08.179 --> 39:09.430
{\an8}- I'M GLAD
YOU'RE HONEST WITH ME.

39:09.513 --> 39:10.973
{\an8}I APPRECIATE IT.
I REALLY DO.

39:11.057 --> 39:12.433
{\an8}THAT--LIKE...

39:12.516 --> 39:13.726
{\an8}I'M LIKE,
"THANK YOU, DEENA.

39:13.809 --> 39:15.311
{\an8}YOU DON'T EVEN
KNOW ME THAT WELL,"

39:15.394 --> 39:17.146
{\an8}I WAS LIKE, "AND I KNOW THESE
GIRLS IN THIS HOUSE FOR A YEAR.

39:17.229 --> 39:18.731
{\an8}AND THEY WON'T
SAY ANYTHING."

39:18.814 --> 39:20.107
{\an8}I REALIZE THE ONLY REASON
I WAS HERE IS 'CAUSE OF HER.

39:20.191 --> 39:23.611
{\an8}- SHE FEELS...EMBARRASSED.

39:23.694 --> 39:24.612
{\an8}- SHE'S CRUSHED.
SHE'S DESTROYED.

39:24.695 --> 39:25.738
{\an8}- CRUSHED.
- I'M EMBARRASSED TOO.

39:25.821 --> 39:27.615
{\an8}I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHY
I'M STILL HERE.

39:27.698 --> 39:29.867
{\an8}WITH NOTHING TO...
- DON'T CRY.

39:29.950 --> 39:32.161
{\an8}- I'M NOT, BUT...
- OKAY.

39:36.207 --> 39:39.877
{\an8}- I'M NOT GONNA MAKE MYSELF
BETTER HERE.

39:39.960 --> 39:42.630
{\an8}- YOU THINK YOU'RE GONNA
LEAVE ALSO?

39:42.713 --> 39:46.634
{\an8}THE LAST THING I WANT
IS FOR BOTH OF YOU TO LEAVE.

39:46.717 --> 39:48.302
{\an8}- I CAN PUT UP A FRONT.

39:48.385 --> 39:51.222
{\an8}GO OUT, DRINK
AS MUCH AS I WANT.

39:51.305 --> 39:53.724
{\an8}I'M JUST GONNA DESTROY MYSELF
MORE AND MORE.

39:53.808 --> 39:56.644
{\an8}I'M EMBARRASSED
OF MY ACTIONS.

39:56.727 --> 39:58.270
{\an8}AND AT THIS POINT,
I JUST WANT TO GO HOME.

39:58.354 --> 40:00.147
{\an8}- DON'T LEAVE, THOUGH.

40:00.231 --> 40:01.482
{\an8}DON'T BE STUPID.

40:01.565 --> 40:03.400
{\an8}- I KNOW WHAT'S BEST FOR ME.

40:03.484 --> 40:04.819
{\an8}JUST LIKE THAT'S WHAT
SHE NEEDED,

40:04.902 --> 40:07.321
{\an8}AND THAT'S WHAT I NEED.

40:07.404 --> 40:09.990
{\an8}THIS IS NOT WORTH IT
WITHOUT HER.
