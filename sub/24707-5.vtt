WEBVTT

00:17.559 --> 00:19.519
Let the traffic through.
Let the traffic through.

00:19.644 --> 00:22.272
What do we got?
- DOA is Anthony Garret.

00:22.439 --> 00:24.149
Neighborhood skell. He was half a pimp.

00:24.315 --> 00:26.735
Street name was Tricky.
Got any witnesses?

00:27.068 --> 00:29.320
Neighbor who called it in heard shots.
Went over to the window.

00:29.446 --> 00:30.989
Saw a white guy run
out of the Laundromat.

00:31.114 --> 00:33.199
Then she said a minute later,
this girl comes out.

00:33.491 --> 00:36.661
Looks like she's sleepwalking.
We picked her up a couple blocks away.

00:36.995 --> 00:39.330
- Says she didn't see a thing.
- Did she give you her name?

00:40.040 --> 00:41.082
Holly Snyder.

00:41.458 --> 00:42.667
All right. Andy.

00:43.626 --> 00:46.546
This girl looks like the one, uh,
that stood up in the ATM case.

00:49.257 --> 00:50.508
Let's take a look over here.

00:53.720 --> 00:56.598
Hey, Holly.
- Yeah? What?

00:57.098 --> 01:00.435
- Detective Sipowicz. You remember me?
- Hi.

01:00.935 --> 01:03.271
- What happened here?
- I don't know.

01:03.438 --> 01:06.274
Some guy got shot, Holly.
You were seen leaving.

01:06.900 --> 01:08.318
I didn't kill anybody.

01:08.693 --> 01:11.654
- I think you know what happened.
- I don't know what happened.

01:13.782 --> 01:15.200
Okay. Come on with us.

01:15.366 --> 01:16.951
I don't know what happened. All right.
Yeah, all right.

01:17.035 --> 01:18.078
You don't know what happened.

01:18.203 --> 01:20.413
- Let's go to the station house.
- Can I get my laundry?

01:21.081 --> 01:23.166
- Where is it?
- One of these dryers.

01:23.166 --> 01:24.667
Looks like he's been
living on the street.

01:29.923 --> 01:32.217
So who's the girl?
She helped us out before.

01:32.217 --> 01:36.304
Her uncle was pulling robbery-assaults
at some ATM machines.

01:36.679 --> 01:38.932
Turns out the guy was raping her
since she was 12.

01:39.140 --> 01:40.767
She was the one that gave him up.

01:44.771 --> 01:46.064
Guess they're not there.

01:51.402 --> 01:56.241
- Holly, these them?
- Yeah. There they are.

01:59.619 --> 02:01.538
She's screwed up now.
Oh, yeah.

02:01.663 --> 02:03.123
Would you get the Crime Scene guys
in here?

02:03.498 --> 02:04.958
Look at all the blood.

02:09.087 --> 02:11.256
Come on. Let's go.

03:30.084 --> 03:32.462
Can I get a drink? A soda or somethin'?

03:32.670 --> 03:34.380
Yeah. We're gonna
take care of that for you.

03:34.964 --> 03:39.135
- Diane. Wanna run the interview with Andy?
- Yeah. Thanks.

03:39.594 --> 03:41.137
Oh, Detective Sipowicz!

03:42.305 --> 03:43.348
Now?

03:44.766 --> 03:47.977
- I'm talkin' to somebody. Maybe later.
- Okay.

03:51.439 --> 03:52.941
Hey, Bob.
- What's doing, James.

03:55.068 --> 03:56.611
How's it going?
Hey.

03:56.986 --> 03:59.155
Ronnie Drucker.
I'm assigned here startin' today.

03:59.322 --> 04:01.991
- Name's Martinez. Nice to meet you.
- Where's your PAA?

04:02.200 --> 04:03.701
Donna? She's out today.

04:04.077 --> 04:05.870
- Ah, I hear she's a babe.
- Yeah.

04:06.496 --> 04:08.831
Bobby, this is Ronnie Drucker.
He just transferred into the squad.

04:08.915 --> 04:09.999
- How's it going, Ronnie?
- How's it going?

04:10.083 --> 04:11.918
- Where you coming in from?
- Vice. Public Morals.

04:12.418 --> 04:15.129
- You know Rick Girelli?
- Since before the flood.

04:15.338 --> 04:17.465
Yeah. He's getting on in years there, huh?

04:17.674 --> 04:19.217
- Yeah.
- The lieutenant's in there

04:19.217 --> 04:20.718
- with the zone commander.
- Yeah?

04:21.052 --> 04:23.221
Maybe gettin' the lowdown
on my impending doom.

04:23.346 --> 04:25.932
What do you mean?
- There's a big IAB bug

04:26.057 --> 04:27.850
- crawling up my shorts.
- Oh, yeah?

04:28.101 --> 04:31.354
Nothin' you guys need to worry about.
Before those humps land me,

04:31.980 --> 04:33.231
I'm landin' on this island.

04:34.440 --> 04:38.027
Undamaged in tropical storm Marilyn.
Little huts on the beach.

04:38.403 --> 04:41.155
Bring you a pie, some drinks
right to your towel.

04:41.823 --> 04:43.491
That sounds good. Yeah.

04:43.783 --> 04:46.786
What's he going down for?
- He's in bed with a Colombian woman.

04:47.203 --> 04:49.539
Washes coke money,
and they think she moves weight.

04:50.331 --> 04:51.582
Left his wife over her.

04:51.833 --> 04:53.543
The department wanted him
out of Public Morals...

04:53.793 --> 04:54.836
before they took him down.

04:55.044 --> 04:57.839
They want you to let him catch,
and you treat him like a normal transfer.

04:58.339 --> 04:59.590
They don't think he knows he's hot?

04:59.757 --> 05:04.137
Arthur, I'm just a messenger.
The chief of "D"s laid him on me.

05:04.345 --> 05:05.722
You're the man. I'm comin' to for help.

05:11.853 --> 05:15.023
Lieutenant, just don't put him
on somethin' that's gonna take long.

05:17.775 --> 05:19.402
You're Drucker?
Yes, sir.

05:19.652 --> 05:22.363
Yeah, okay. Uh, Arthur Fancy.
Our PAA's out sick.

05:22.572 --> 05:24.282
Why don't you take her desk for now?

05:25.533 --> 05:26.534
Am I catchin'?

05:26.951 --> 05:29.495
- You're a detective, right?
- What time is it?

05:36.961 --> 05:39.047
- Big cloud over this guy's head.
- Yeah, he was telling me.

05:39.255 --> 05:42.216
Yeah, they want him catching cases.
You keep an eye on him?

05:42.967 --> 05:44.886
- Come on.
- Yeah, okay.

05:45.053 --> 05:46.054
Thanks.

06:00.318 --> 06:03.029
I was doing my laundry.
I got busy doing something,

06:03.029 --> 06:04.405
and I didn't see what happened.

06:04.614 --> 06:07.075
- So you didn't know Tricky?
- I knew who he was.

06:07.241 --> 06:08.534
I didn't know him personally.

06:08.701 --> 06:10.912
Do you date guys, Holly?
Is that how you earn your money?

06:11.162 --> 06:13.498
- You mean, am I a prostitute?
- Are you?

06:13.831 --> 06:16.125
Andy?

06:24.342 --> 06:26.886
Someone just dropped a dime
on that Laundromat homicide.

06:26.886 --> 06:28.721
He said the guy you were looking for
was named Howie.

06:29.138 --> 06:31.474
"Howie shot Tricky in the Laundromat.
Howie pulled the trigger."

06:31.474 --> 06:33.559
- He hung up the phone.
- All right. Thanks, James.

06:34.143 --> 06:36.145
- Yeah, no problem.
- Listen, James.

06:36.229 --> 06:37.397
Yeah?

06:38.523 --> 06:41.192
- Upstairs John been cuttin' your hair?
- Yeah, twice now.

06:41.818 --> 06:43.945
- So you're, uh, pleased with it?
- Oh, yeah.

06:44.070 --> 06:46.489
- And the price is right too.
- Yeah, he said he don't charge.

06:47.073 --> 06:49.409
So he just... he just gives you a haircut?

06:49.992 --> 06:52.662
Oh, yeah, yeah.
That little room off Anti-crime.

06:52.829 --> 06:54.372
- Yeah.
- I think he does a nice job.

06:54.497 --> 06:56.916
Yeah, yeah. Your hair looks good.
All right, thanks.

06:57.041 --> 06:58.209
Okay.

07:03.798 --> 07:07.510
Holly says she does date guys,
but she wasn't working for Tricky.

07:08.803 --> 07:10.930
You got men's clothing
in your wash, Holly.

07:11.889 --> 07:14.016
- Whose clothes is that?
- I don't know.

07:15.101 --> 07:18.187
Was it Howie's? Hmm?
Was Howie in the Laundromat?

07:20.398 --> 07:22.483
Holly, we're gonna grab Howie up,

07:22.608 --> 07:24.944
and we're either gonna charge
both of you on this homicide,

07:25.069 --> 07:26.654
or you're gonna help us on what happened.

07:27.321 --> 07:29.323
- Jerry's our friend.
- Jerry?

07:29.407 --> 07:31.492
And they had made a bet,
and they had a disagreement.

07:31.617 --> 07:34.579
- Then Jerry left.
- Jerry and Tricky had a disagreement?

07:34.871 --> 07:36.706
- Howie and Jerry.
- What was it about?

07:37.582 --> 07:39.000
Nothing. It was stupid.

07:40.209 --> 07:41.711
So then Jerry left.

07:42.628 --> 07:44.964
And then I guess Tricky walked
by the Laundromat,

07:45.506 --> 07:47.675
and saw us in there,
and he must've come in blasting.

07:49.260 --> 07:50.386
Jerry and Howie had a fight,

07:50.470 --> 07:52.138
but Jerry don't have nothin' to do
with the shooting?

07:52.472 --> 07:54.432
- Right.
- Jerry had already left.

07:54.724 --> 07:57.059
But Tricky comes in blastin'.
Why was he blastin'?

07:57.602 --> 08:02.482
Howie had sold him some junk allegedly,
and it was allegedly weak junk.

08:02.690 --> 08:06.444
And Tricky was telling all kinds of people
Howie's a dead man, and he had a gun.

08:06.736 --> 08:10.031
And Howie heard it from so many people,
finally, he got his own gun.

08:10.740 --> 08:11.991
And that's what must've happened.

08:13.284 --> 08:15.745
You're saying that Tricky came
to kill Howie,

08:15.870 --> 08:17.079
but Howie killed him instead?

08:17.497 --> 08:20.208
- He must've.
- Is that what you saw, Holly?

08:20.333 --> 08:22.585
- I guess.
- You did or you didn't, Holly?

08:25.004 --> 08:28.132
I was sick. I went in the bathroom
to get sick when Tricky was coming in.

08:28.591 --> 08:30.927
So you didn't see the shooting,
but you heard it?

08:32.053 --> 08:34.847
- Where's Howie cop?
- I don't want to get him involved.

08:35.014 --> 08:36.682
It's already happened. Howie's involved.

08:36.933 --> 08:39.852
Holly, we need you
to pick out Howie for us.

08:44.315 --> 08:45.483
When'd you fix last?

08:49.946 --> 08:53.157
He cops outside
that Greek place on Seventh.

08:54.408 --> 08:55.910
All right. Let's go find him.

08:57.912 --> 08:58.955
Come on.

09:07.046 --> 09:08.714
She gave up a guy.
We're gonna go pick him up.

09:08.881 --> 09:11.676
All right. Andy, this is Ronnie Drucker.
He just transferred in.

09:11.926 --> 09:13.344
- Andy Sipowicz.
- Hey.

09:13.594 --> 09:15.680
How's it goin'?
We're gonna go pick up a skell.

09:15.846 --> 09:19.642
- You got 'em here too, huh?
- I'm supposed to talk to a detective?

09:20.017 --> 09:21.519
- Um...
- I'm up.

09:21.811 --> 09:23.396
You mind if I sit in with you on this?

09:23.980 --> 09:26.315
- Not if that's what the boss wants.
- James, Greg.

09:26.566 --> 09:28.442
- You wanna help us grab a scab?
- Yeah, sure.

09:29.110 --> 09:30.403
I'm gonna work this with Ronnie.

09:30.570 --> 09:34.490
- Detective Drucker. Detective Simone.
- Hey.

09:34.657 --> 09:37.159
The guy we wanna make a complaint about,
his name is Markham.

09:37.660 --> 09:39.287
He tried to molest my son Tommy.

09:39.453 --> 09:41.956
- Let's talk in the interview room.
- It's right down here to the right.

09:51.632 --> 09:53.384
Yeah. Just...
- Sit here, Tommy.

09:56.178 --> 09:58.347
Got some fresh kicks there, Tommy.

09:58.973 --> 10:02.935
The guy's name is Louis Markham.
418 11th Street, 4-C.

10:04.437 --> 10:05.521
Tell him about the robe.

10:06.647 --> 10:08.649
He opened his robe
when I was in his apartment,

10:08.983 --> 10:10.359
and he was touching his privates.

10:10.818 --> 10:12.361
How'd you come to be in there, Tommy?

10:12.528 --> 10:15.573
Tommy picks up Markham's mail
because the old man's got a bad back.

10:15.698 --> 10:18.075
- He did it every day.
- Mr. Gennero, let your son tell us.

10:19.243 --> 10:22.079
I've been picking his mail up
for about a year and a half now, I guess.

10:22.330 --> 10:25.124
And has that happened before,
what you said your neighbor did?

10:25.458 --> 10:28.586
- No, I don't think so.
- I got a serious mind to take after this

10:28.753 --> 10:29.879
- fag with a ball bat!
- Hey!

10:37.470 --> 10:40.598
When you say he was touchin' his privates,

10:40.806 --> 10:43.100
you mean, like, he was playing
with himself, Tommy?

10:43.225 --> 10:44.602
You know that expression?

10:45.853 --> 10:49.065
He showed his thing, and then I ran out.
Did he try to touch you?

10:49.815 --> 10:52.652
- No.
- Did he ask you to do anything?

10:57.031 --> 10:58.115
No. He just showed his thing.

10:58.449 --> 10:59.867
How long were you
in the apartment?

10:59.992 --> 11:01.160
Not very long.

11:01.827 --> 11:05.539
Tommy, could this have been,
like, an accident,

11:05.831 --> 11:07.875
you know, where his robe just popped open?

11:08.000 --> 11:10.086
How could it be an accident?
The guy shows his joint

11:10.294 --> 11:11.420
and plays with himself.

11:11.754 --> 11:13.631
He didn't say that
he was playing with himself.

11:13.964 --> 11:17.426
- Oh, yeah. I can see where this is goin'.
- I don't think it was an accident.

11:19.387 --> 11:21.514
Was he playing with himself, Tommy?

11:21.639 --> 11:24.725
Because that makes it
a whole different situation.

11:29.271 --> 11:30.398
No.

11:33.776 --> 11:36.112
Okay. There's a bench right outside.

11:36.404 --> 11:38.406
You wanna go take a seat
while we talk to your dad?

11:38.531 --> 11:39.949
- Okay.
- Okay.

11:40.950 --> 11:43.536
Hey, thanks for coming in, Tommy.
I know you didn't like talking about this.

11:48.624 --> 11:50.042
What are you gonna do about this guy?

11:50.209 --> 11:53.337
Well, what your son just told us
isn't grounds for an arrest, Mr. Gennero.

11:53.504 --> 11:54.505
What's that pervert gotta do,

11:54.505 --> 11:56.215
lay hands on my kid before
you guys do somethin'?

11:56.507 --> 11:58.050
It's not clear what went on
in that apartment.

11:58.134 --> 11:59.176
And I think you realize that.

11:59.343 --> 12:02.555
We can talk to this guy Markham,
let him know we're aware of the situation.

12:02.763 --> 12:05.641
- Think he's gonna confess?
- I'm telling you what we can do.

12:08.811 --> 12:11.605
Sometimes, just knowing that the police
are aware, that has an effect.

12:11.981 --> 12:14.442
What he oughta do is get out.
Let him go molest some other kid.

12:14.567 --> 12:17.987
- All right. Thanks for coming in.
- You'll talk to this pervert now?

12:18.237 --> 12:20.030
Yeah. That's the plan.

12:20.114 --> 12:22.241
Take your son home, Mr. Gennero.
This is a tough thing for him.

12:27.204 --> 12:28.622
What a hump. Hmm.

12:29.123 --> 12:30.124
You got the pedigree?

12:30.583 --> 12:31.959
You wanna answer the beeper
before we go?

12:32.251 --> 12:36.130
Ah, she don't put a 911 in it,
she's just callin' to piss in my ear.

12:37.214 --> 12:39.258
It's my girlfriend...
the broad that's gonna ruin me.

12:48.434 --> 12:50.394
We sit much longer,
they're gonna know the corner's up.

12:50.853 --> 12:52.897
He cops around one every day.

12:56.901 --> 12:58.360
You never got on your bus?

12:59.570 --> 13:02.907
I got on. I met Howie in Raleigh-Durham.

13:03.699 --> 13:05.451
After a while, we came back here.

13:15.669 --> 13:17.421
- That's him.
- Which?

13:17.671 --> 13:20.549
In the leather jacket.
The guy in the light-colored cap,

13:20.716 --> 13:23.177
and black leather jacket.
He's coming at ya. Take him.

13:36.273 --> 13:37.650
Hey, come here.

13:49.745 --> 13:50.913
Chill! Chill!

13:50.913 --> 13:53.040
- I ain't holding, man!
- Yeah? How about laundry, Howie?

13:53.207 --> 13:55.209
- You doing any laundry?
- I don't know what you're talking about.

13:55.209 --> 13:57.837
I'm talking about you doing laundry
for the first time in six months.

13:57.962 --> 14:00.756
- Some guy winds up dead.
- I didn't have nothing to do with that.

14:00.881 --> 14:03.217
Oh, there's a fresh concept, Howie.
You weren't involved.

14:03.384 --> 14:05.177
I wanna hear all about it
down at the station house.

14:05.261 --> 14:06.971
We'll transport him. Let's go, man.

14:21.902 --> 14:24.446
There she goes. 911.

14:28.492 --> 14:29.994
Colombian bombshell.

14:33.747 --> 14:36.625
Who's there?
- New York City detectives.

14:39.420 --> 14:43.632
- What do you want? What's it about?
- Can we talk to you inside, Mr. Markham?

14:43.841 --> 14:47.011
- I don't know what it's about.
- Can we come inside, sir?

14:55.185 --> 14:58.022
Mr. Markham, we received
a sexual complaint

14:58.272 --> 15:00.566
concerning you
and the boy who delivers your mail.

15:00.983 --> 15:03.068
- What?
- Your neighbor's son, Tommy Gennero,

15:03.193 --> 15:06.530
- he says you exposed your privates to him.
- I didn't do anything to that boy.

15:07.197 --> 15:10.826
- Him and his father filed a complaint.
- This is sickening. It's psychotic!

15:10.910 --> 15:14.622
So you deny the allegations?
- Yes. I'd never do something like that.

15:17.666 --> 15:21.128
Okay. That makes this
an uncorroborated situation.

15:21.253 --> 15:23.547
So we won't be goin'
with the formal charges.

15:23.714 --> 15:27.301
But I want you to know that we're aware
with this situation, Mr. Markham.

15:27.426 --> 15:28.552
We got a case open on it.

15:28.677 --> 15:32.056
And you wanna stay out
of contact with this boy.

15:32.264 --> 15:34.350
- Oh, my God.
- It's just a good idea,

15:34.350 --> 15:35.976
Mr. Markham, whatever went on here.

15:36.226 --> 15:39.063
That boy likes me.
I've only been friendly to him.

15:39.521 --> 15:42.524
Don't you talk about friendly,
you sick son of a bitch!

15:42.650 --> 15:44.777
- Get out of here, Mr. Gennero.
- I know what you are,

15:44.777 --> 15:46.153
and everyone else is gonna know!

15:46.362 --> 15:48.489
- You oughta get your sick ass out!
- You get out!

15:48.614 --> 15:51.784
- All of you get out!
- Go make a pass at somebody else's kid!

15:52.660 --> 15:54.203
I'd never hurt a child.

15:57.998 --> 16:02.252
Just, uh, keep your robe closed,
all right? And get your own mail.

16:04.546 --> 16:06.298
This is a two-way street here,
Mr. Gennero.

16:06.465 --> 16:07.466
Meaning what?

16:07.591 --> 16:09.593
Beeps me 911 again.
I gotta see what's going on.

16:09.677 --> 16:11.387
It means you leave that man alone too.

16:11.553 --> 16:13.681
He shows his joint to my kid,
and you threaten me?

16:13.806 --> 16:16.558
Look, this man doesn't get around so good.
It won't be hard staying away from him.

16:16.725 --> 16:18.435
He should get out!
- Did you hear what I just said to you?

16:18.519 --> 16:22.064
Yeah, I heard what you said.
Thanks for your tremendous help!

16:23.607 --> 16:24.984
You mind taking a ride?

16:25.401 --> 16:27.403
Well, you don't wanna give her a call,
see what's goin' on?

16:27.569 --> 16:29.113
I'd feel better going up there.

16:53.387 --> 16:54.722
My girlfriend's out of her mind.

16:56.223 --> 16:58.308
Is that why we drove up here
to check on her mental state?

16:58.684 --> 17:00.686
She's hearing clicks
on the phone.

17:00.894 --> 17:02.563
- She thinks it's bugged.
- Is it?

17:03.188 --> 17:06.400
IAB scummers.
I oughta throw a rock at 'em.

17:07.818 --> 17:09.778
Well, why would they wanna
bug a beauty parlor, I wonder?

17:09.987 --> 17:12.072
Because they figure
she's into other things.

17:12.364 --> 17:14.908
Listen, Drucker, I'm sorry that you got
all these problems, okay?

17:15.117 --> 17:17.202
But I'm not too thrilled about getting
dragged down here, all right?

17:17.411 --> 17:18.620
That's an IAB tail over there,

17:18.746 --> 17:20.789
and they're seeing
me comin' out of the precinct too.

17:21.206 --> 17:22.458
She runs an after-hours joint.

17:22.583 --> 17:25.002
It gives bartenders a chance
to catch a drink after work.

17:25.127 --> 17:26.962
- So big deal.
- Maybe lets a couple of dope dealers

17:27.046 --> 17:29.757
- hang out in there?
- See, that's racial prejudice on your part

17:29.882 --> 17:31.717
just 'cause she's Colombian.

17:31.884 --> 17:34.720
- Drucker, don't even go there.
- All right.

17:35.304 --> 17:38.265
I don't care who your girl is
or where she's from.

17:38.599 --> 17:41.060
You're dragging me down to some hot spot
at the ass end of the Bronx

17:41.185 --> 17:43.353
over here with an IAB tail.
You're gonna put me in the jackpot.

17:43.520 --> 17:44.688
I'm sorry.

17:44.980 --> 17:47.900
She dials a 911 on my beeper.
I thought they were dropping a hammer.

17:48.108 --> 17:51.195
- Keep me out of your business.
- All right. All right.

17:58.160 --> 18:02.498
Here's what I got, Howie.
I got Holly puts you in the Laundromat.

18:02.998 --> 18:06.251
I got a lady across the street
hears a gunshot from the Laundromat.

18:06.543 --> 18:08.712
Crosses her apartment.
Sees you runnin' out.

18:09.129 --> 18:11.757
Now, those two witnesses, my job's over.

18:11.965 --> 18:14.343
The DA'll go to bat.
I ain't going down for this.

18:14.551 --> 18:17.221
I didn't shoot nobody.
You want a guy named...

18:17.554 --> 18:20.599
Jerry Smithers, Smithson,
something like that.

18:20.724 --> 18:24.478
Mm-mmm. That's a loser, Howie.
Don't give me Jerry. Jerry was gone.

18:24.895 --> 18:25.979
Yeah, well, Jerry came back.

18:27.106 --> 18:28.148
Jerry came back?

18:28.357 --> 18:30.234
Tricky came in... the guy that got smoked.

18:30.484 --> 18:33.487
- Dead Tricky, right.
- Well, he came in all pissed off at me...

18:33.654 --> 18:36.365
about some little misunderstanding
we had a couple weeks ago.

18:36.365 --> 18:39.201
- When you sold him the bad dope?
- Yeah, but I didn't know it was a beat.

18:39.535 --> 18:41.703
So I explained that to him.
We were gettin' it straight.

18:41.829 --> 18:43.372
Did you find 12 dollars on him?

18:45.916 --> 18:46.959
Tell me your side.

18:47.209 --> 18:50.170
I gave him 12 bucks to start making
the money part all good.

18:50.337 --> 18:52.631
- And then Jerry comes in with a gun.
- Why?

18:52.965 --> 18:55.509
'Cause he's an asshole.
He's a crackhead. He was all tweaked out.

18:55.968 --> 18:57.010
He capped Tricky.

18:57.219 --> 18:58.929
Holly said you and Jerry
were having a beef.

18:59.096 --> 19:00.931
Was he going for you?

19:01.473 --> 19:03.559
He could've been. You know,
I don't know whether he was looking

19:03.559 --> 19:05.686
to smoke me, Tricky or what.

19:06.186 --> 19:07.980
And Holly's in the bathroom?
Puking.

19:08.522 --> 19:11.942
- Did she see Jerry come back?
- Nah. She probably didn't see him.

19:12.151 --> 19:14.278
But that's what happened,
I swear to God.

19:15.779 --> 19:18.949
If I spend time on this, Howie,
and I find that you're pulling my pud,

19:19.074 --> 19:20.868
I'm comin' back here
and I'm gonna give you a smack

19:20.868 --> 19:23.996
and I'm gonna hurt you with the DA.
Now, is this a straight story?

19:24.163 --> 19:26.915
Absolutely. Absolutely straight.

19:27.249 --> 19:29.585
- All right. Give me an address.
- Come on.

19:29.585 --> 19:30.878
The guy'll know it came from me.

19:32.337 --> 19:35.716
Yeah,
he might think ill of you, Howie.

19:36.008 --> 19:38.468
Of course, he did try
to murder you already.

19:40.846 --> 19:43.265
908 14th, 3-A.

19:44.099 --> 19:45.893
Jerry Smith-something.

20:00.282 --> 20:03.744
- Howie go?
- No. Howie gave us Jerry.

20:03.911 --> 20:05.120
He give us a place to look?

20:05.412 --> 20:08.290
I gotta talk to this girl.
Then we'll grab the guy up.

20:11.418 --> 20:13.045
I'll do the file.
Yeah, great.

20:13.045 --> 20:14.296
How's it goin'?

20:23.597 --> 20:25.015
I want off this guy, Lieu.

20:25.265 --> 20:27.476
- What happened?
- I just... I don't wanna work with him.

20:27.976 --> 20:30.604
He puts me at a wrong spot,
on duty, out of command.

20:30.771 --> 20:33.857
- Out of command where?
- His "goom" beeps him a 911.

20:34.107 --> 20:36.652
We ride over to the Bronx.
They got IAB set up on her place.

20:36.902 --> 20:38.987
I mean, I know this guy two hours.
I'll take care of this.

20:39.446 --> 20:41.573
Don't hurt him, Lieu.
Just take me off him.

20:41.823 --> 20:43.992
I'm not gonna hurt the guy, Bobby.
I'm gonna sit him down.

20:57.881 --> 21:00.092
Hey, John.
- Oh, ready, Detective?

21:00.425 --> 21:02.594
I gotta talk to someone
and pick somebody up.

21:02.803 --> 21:04.638
Would you consider a possibility?

21:05.138 --> 21:07.224
- Just put it in your hopper.
- What?

21:09.101 --> 21:12.020
Shorter, more layered,
and blocked at the nape.

21:12.521 --> 21:15.816
- I just want a regular haircut, John.
- That would be a regular haircut...

21:16.400 --> 21:19.319
- with the line raised in back.
- I wouldn't be interested in that.

21:20.404 --> 21:21.613
Fine. No problem.

21:24.408 --> 21:26.952
- Just holler when you're ready.
- Yeah, I'll find you.

21:29.538 --> 21:30.831
Give me a second here.

21:35.252 --> 21:38.380
- How you holdin' up?
- Pretty achy.

21:40.132 --> 21:42.634
Holly, could this Jerry have come back
to that Laundromat...

21:42.926 --> 21:44.052
after Tricky came in?

21:44.219 --> 21:47.180
- I didn't see him come back.
- How long were you in the bathroom?

21:47.389 --> 21:50.392
A few minutes.
I guess he could've come back.

21:50.684 --> 21:52.352
That's what Howie's saying happened.

21:53.145 --> 21:55.522
Jerry came back to shoot him.
He shot Tricky instead.

21:56.231 --> 21:57.941
I know Jerry was pissed off at Howie.

21:58.275 --> 22:00.610
And you were in the bathroom long enough,
Jerry might've come back in.

22:01.361 --> 22:04.156
- Do you know where Jerry lives?
- Somewhere on 14th.

22:04.781 --> 22:08.577
- 908 14th. That's what Howie said.
- Sounds right.

22:14.833 --> 22:16.460
You take any aspirins or anything?

22:17.586 --> 22:18.879
Would they give me some?

22:20.255 --> 22:21.340
Yeah, they'll bring you some in.

22:33.060 --> 22:34.895
Here's the five on that dicky waver, Lieu.

22:35.145 --> 22:36.605
You're not gonna be catching anymore.

22:38.899 --> 22:41.526
- What's the problem?
- Other than the ones you brought with you?

22:42.110 --> 22:44.946
Why? The bosses are ready
to pull the plug on me?

22:45.072 --> 22:47.574
- They want a stationary target?
- Just do what I tell you to.

22:47.824 --> 22:50.452
- Work your tours at your desk.
- Or did Simone pitch a beef?

22:50.660 --> 22:53.705
Conversation's over, Drucker.
Work at your desk.

22:56.500 --> 22:58.085
As long as I'm promoted to flowerpot,

22:58.585 --> 23:00.629
can I take some lost time,
go see my family?

23:00.837 --> 23:05.300
- Where were you just now?
- In the Bronx. My family's on Long Island.

23:06.343 --> 23:08.470
Yeah. Go see your family.

23:10.055 --> 23:16.311
15th Squad. Yeah, this is Fancy.

23:19.773 --> 23:22.484
What, do you get a gold star up here
when you rat a guy out?

23:23.527 --> 23:24.694
Nobody ratted you out, Ronnie.

23:26.279 --> 23:27.781
I just didn't wanna work with you.

23:28.115 --> 23:31.034
Oh. And you figured the boss would
take that as a big endorsement?

23:31.993 --> 23:32.994
Wait a minute.

23:33.078 --> 23:35.622
First, you do some half-ass interview
wanting to get to the Bronx.

23:35.789 --> 23:37.833
No, no, no, no. There was nothing more
I could do on that case.

23:37.958 --> 23:39.709
We don't know who's zooming who,
do we, Ronnie?

23:40.377 --> 23:43.463
We don't know if the old guy was lying,
or Gennero was looking to hurt him.

23:43.547 --> 23:46.258
Then we ride up to the Bronx,
and you don't think twice

23:46.383 --> 23:48.260
about puttin' me in front
of IAB's headlights?

23:48.427 --> 23:50.053
I mean, did you save my life,
and I don't remember?

23:50.387 --> 23:51.930
Is that why it's okay
for you to jam me up?

23:52.055 --> 23:53.473
Hey, Ronnie, you want
that brochure back?

23:54.808 --> 23:57.853
No, you keep it.
In a couple days, you get a Polaroid.

23:58.311 --> 24:02.441
Me, right on that beach.
I did what I could on that case.

24:03.358 --> 24:04.776
I was okay at the job.

24:04.943 --> 24:07.529
I guess if I knew you better,
that'd strike me as sad.

24:16.121 --> 24:17.664
I don't think that place
looks so great, huh?

24:17.914 --> 24:19.624
I don't think he does either, James.

24:36.433 --> 24:38.477
DOA 816 11th street.

24:39.227 --> 24:41.438
11th? Who's the DOA?

24:41.938 --> 24:44.900
A guy named Markham.
Found him hanging in his apartment.

25:12.177 --> 25:13.303
Hey, what happened here?

25:13.470 --> 25:15.263
Looks like he tied an electrical cord
to the knob,

25:15.430 --> 25:16.723
ran it over the top of the door.

25:18.725 --> 25:20.560
- Did he leave a note?
- No. Uh-uh.

25:20.810 --> 25:21.895
That's his son in the kitchen.

25:22.062 --> 25:24.731
He's the one who found him.
Uh, Walter Markham.

25:25.023 --> 25:26.483
Get him down, huh?
- Yeah.

25:30.362 --> 25:34.199
Mr. Markham? I'm Detective Simone.

25:34.866 --> 25:38.370
- I'm sorry for your loss.
- I guess I shouldn't be surprised.

25:39.037 --> 25:40.747
Had your father tried
something like this before?

25:42.165 --> 25:45.585
He'd been depressed, though.
He was getting treated for it.

25:45.919 --> 25:46.962
Was that, like, chronic,

25:46.962 --> 25:49.005
or was there something specific
that had gotten him down?

25:49.172 --> 25:52.342
He broke his back in 1991.
Fell down a flight of stairs.

25:52.509 --> 25:55.136
- He had a lot of problems from it.
- Physical problems too?

25:55.845 --> 25:56.930
He was in a lot of pain,

25:56.930 --> 26:00.892
and he had some
sexual difficulties from it.

26:01.017 --> 26:04.646
He was seeing a woman from Albany,
but that ended after the accident.

26:05.480 --> 26:07.566
- Your dad was impotent?
- Yes.

26:09.651 --> 26:10.652
Why is that important?

26:12.779 --> 26:14.573
All right, Mr. Markham.
Let us square our part away

26:14.823 --> 26:16.866
as quick as we can
and let you take care of your dad.

26:17.784 --> 26:19.244
Again, I'm sorry for your loss, sir.

26:27.836 --> 26:29.963
- MALE VOICE 1: I got him. I got him.
- MALE VOICE 2: All right.

26:30.672 --> 26:32.090
- MALE VOICE 2: Easy.
- MALE VOICE 1: Yeah.

26:37.846 --> 26:40.599
What happened in there?
- What do you mean, Mr. Gennero?

26:41.224 --> 26:44.185
- Did he leave a note or anything?
- Come here.

26:47.439 --> 26:49.482
- What's that to you?
- Hey, the guy killed himself.

26:49.608 --> 26:51.443
He was a pervert wacko.
Mm-hmm.

26:51.568 --> 26:52.819
You got a guilty conscience?

26:52.944 --> 26:54.821
You worried about what he might've written
on that note?

26:54.946 --> 26:57.157
I got no guilty conscience.
Maybe he had the guilty conscience.

26:57.157 --> 26:59.659
You know, I'm getting a real bad feeling
off you, Mr. Gennero.

27:02.787 --> 27:05.081
- Hey, Tommy.
- Get back upstairs.

27:06.291 --> 27:08.793
What's the matter? You don't want me
talking to your boy? Why's that?

27:08.918 --> 27:12.672
You watch your tone of voice.
Tommy, get back upstairs.

27:15.050 --> 27:17.177
That old man,
he was impotent, Mr. Gennero.

27:17.344 --> 27:19.971
- He couldn't make advances on anybody.
- My kid told me what happened.

27:20.138 --> 27:24.059
Oh, yeah? Did he? Or did you tell him
and then make him lie,

27:24.225 --> 27:25.977
and then maybe
throw in some new sneakers?

27:26.227 --> 27:28.897
You're crazy!
- What the hell's going on here? Huh?

27:29.648 --> 27:31.733
Is there some kind of rent bounty
on that old man's place?

27:31.858 --> 27:33.276
You lookin' to earn off of that man?

27:33.401 --> 27:35.403
- You keep away from me.
- I'm gonna keep away from you,

27:35.570 --> 27:37.781
'cause if I leaned on your boy,
and found out that

27:37.781 --> 27:40.033
you did file some kind of false report,
you know what I could do?

27:40.033 --> 27:42.994
I could maybe get you a 50-dollar fine.
But let me tell you something Mr. Gennero.

27:43.203 --> 27:45.789
If you used your boy
to drive that old man over the edge,

27:45.914 --> 27:48.750
if you made him lie so that you could work
some kind of angle,

27:49.668 --> 27:54.130
you ruined your boy's life,
and I hope you burn in hell.

28:13.191 --> 28:14.776
I got about ten minutes.

28:16.152 --> 28:17.237
Let's do it.

28:22.200 --> 28:24.619
Try to relax, Detective.
I did this all the time in the 27.

28:24.703 --> 28:25.912
I never got a single complaint.

28:25.912 --> 28:28.915
We're printing a guy, I wanna let him stew
a little bit before the interview.

28:30.125 --> 28:32.502
That, uh, layer or whatever
you're talking about...

28:32.669 --> 28:34.838
- Uh-huh.
- That, uh, "nape at the block" thing.

28:35.171 --> 28:36.798
- We're not doing' that, right?
- No.

28:37.048 --> 28:38.967
I'll bring in a magazine
and show you what I had in mind.

28:38.967 --> 28:40.510
Good. Let me take a look at that.

28:40.760 --> 28:42.303
There's a photo piece about
the head of Revlon.

28:42.429 --> 28:44.347
- He has exactly your baldness pattern.
- Hmm.

28:45.056 --> 28:46.641
Detective, I hope that you will credit me

28:46.725 --> 28:49.102
with a constructive reason
for bringing something up.

28:49.477 --> 28:51.563
- About what?
- For whatever reason,

28:51.771 --> 28:53.189
our paths have crossed
on several occasions,

28:53.273 --> 28:54.983
and I'd like to feel
we have a certain simpatico.

28:55.150 --> 28:56.651
To a point. Uh-huh.

28:57.360 --> 29:01.448
At any rate, some gossip
has been circulating about the...

29:01.990 --> 29:04.367
sexual orientation of a female detective
in your squad.

29:05.160 --> 29:07.203
If it's accurate, I'm active
in an organization

29:07.287 --> 29:10.415
which could help her with various
workplace transitions and adjustments.

29:10.582 --> 29:13.084
But, uh, of course, I'm reluctant
to bring up to her,

29:13.168 --> 29:14.711
"A tale told round the campfire,"
so to speak.

29:15.044 --> 29:17.839
- You heard Lesniak's a dyke.
- I heard she's gay, yes.

29:18.047 --> 29:21.593
And, uh, I'd like very much to reach out
to her but only if it's appropriate.

29:21.801 --> 29:23.553
Well, she said it to Detective Martinez.

29:23.678 --> 29:25.597
I don't know if she submitted
any exhibits.

29:25.847 --> 29:28.183
And Detective Martinez
told it to you directly?

29:28.308 --> 29:29.642
Correct. Yes.

29:29.726 --> 29:31.227
Hey, John.

29:31.519 --> 29:33.897
- Oh, hi, Detective.
- We got that guy printed, Andy.

29:33.897 --> 29:36.524
- Yeah. How do I stand?
- Well, your hair is even.

29:36.608 --> 29:38.359
So it's more or less
a natural stopping place.

29:38.443 --> 29:39.527
Thanks. Thanks a lot.

29:39.652 --> 29:41.529
Uh, I'll bring in a photo
of that haircut for you.

29:41.821 --> 29:44.532
Yeah, yeah. Maybe we'll take a shot
at that "block at the nape" thing.

29:44.824 --> 29:46.785
And, uh, thank you
for your guidance in that other matter.

29:46.910 --> 29:49.162
Yeah, no problem.
On your hair, Andy,

29:49.329 --> 29:51.873
I thought you came to a natural
stopping place several years ago.

29:51.998 --> 29:53.333
Yeah, very funny.

29:58.379 --> 29:59.547
Hey.

30:02.759 --> 30:06.387
How do you wanna go to jail, Jerry?
You wanna go inside with a big rep?

30:07.222 --> 30:10.892
Cold-blooded assassin?
Maybe some mafia hitman?

30:11.100 --> 30:12.602
Give me a break! Mafia hitman?

30:13.102 --> 30:15.146
He's just telling you
how the DA can go with this, Jerry.

30:15.730 --> 30:18.900
He can go with cold-blooded assassin
'cause you went back and got your gun.

30:19.025 --> 30:20.902
I didn't even shoot who I was shooting at.

30:20.902 --> 30:23.530
- How's that a cold-blooded assassin?
- So this got out of hand?

30:24.030 --> 30:26.574
In other words, this, uh, Anthony Garret,

30:26.866 --> 30:28.952
- you weren't after him at all?
- That's what I'm saying.

30:29.118 --> 30:32.288
You had no premeditation?
- I was shooting at the other guy!

30:32.914 --> 30:34.874
Oh, that's not exactly
a cold-blooded assassination.

30:35.333 --> 30:37.877
My only point, you know,
he went back and got his gun.

30:38.044 --> 30:40.004
Uh, that's the appearance
they're gonna get.

30:40.171 --> 30:42.382
Yeah.
- Listen. Listen to this.

30:42.757 --> 30:45.343
The guy sells beat dope. He's a welsher.

30:45.510 --> 30:47.303
- Tricky?
- No, no.

30:47.929 --> 30:50.765
Howie loses ten bucks to me,
and then welshes right in my face.

30:50.974 --> 30:52.684
You two had a bet?

30:53.142 --> 30:55.478
She didn't last four minutes,
and he won't pay the money.

30:55.854 --> 30:58.189
I mean, she's supposed to stay in there
for, like, 15 minutes, right?

30:58.398 --> 31:00.525
I mean, whatever the length
of 20 cents is.

31:00.984 --> 31:02.902
She only lasts, like,
about three or four minutes.

31:03.069 --> 31:05.029
- Who's this?
- The blonde... Doris.

31:05.530 --> 31:07.282
- Holly?
- Holly. Yeah.

31:07.699 --> 31:09.409
You know he made her get
in that dryer?

31:09.409 --> 31:11.536
You think that's fun for her?
I mean, those things are hot,

31:11.536 --> 31:12.912
and you get dizzy.

31:13.580 --> 31:17.041
- I knew she couldn't stay in there.
- So you bet against a full cycle.

31:17.250 --> 31:19.627
The guy's an asshole.
She didn't last five minutes.

31:19.919 --> 31:22.797
- And he beat you on the bet.
- Whoa, whoa. He didn't beat me.

31:23.089 --> 31:27.218
I beat him. She lasts about three minutes,
and then he welshes.

31:27.385 --> 31:29.137
Yeah. He welshed on the bet.

31:29.596 --> 31:31.723
I was on my way to Huron
when I saw Tricky.

31:31.973 --> 31:33.391
That's the rooming house, the Huron?

31:34.142 --> 31:37.020
He was after Howie for, like, two weeks
after burning on some smack.

31:37.186 --> 31:38.897
I mean, that's more proof
of what the guy's like.

31:39.230 --> 31:41.858
- He sells bad smack.
- So I told him where he was.

31:42.358 --> 31:43.693
You told Tricky where Howie was?

31:43.943 --> 31:46.029
Then I went back
to see what happened.

31:46.195 --> 31:47.989
And this was after you got your own gun?

31:48.156 --> 31:51.618
And Tricky had his own gun,
and I figured he was gonna shoot him.

31:51.784 --> 31:52.785
That he'd shoot Howie?

31:53.161 --> 31:55.705
But he was in there
like a pussy. He wasn't doing anything.

31:56.289 --> 31:57.665
But you took care of that, right, Jerry?

31:58.416 --> 32:00.585
You think this is the first time
that guy welshes on me?

32:00.793 --> 32:05.465
- That's like the fifth or sixth time.
- No. Well, you were provoked.

32:07.050 --> 32:10.011
Yeah. Provoked.

32:11.888 --> 32:13.806
I mean, what's the point?
No way you're gonna make him

32:13.890 --> 32:16.267
- responsible for the suicide.
- There's no case.

32:16.684 --> 32:18.895
Come down on the kid so you can
charge the asshole father

32:18.895 --> 32:20.688
with a false report? It's nuts.

32:25.526 --> 32:28.321
- We ran through that interview.
- I never saw you run through an interview.

32:28.696 --> 32:31.574
We ran through that one.
It was the last thing that old man needed.

32:31.783 --> 32:34.243
- It was Drucker's interview.
- Yeah.

32:34.369 --> 32:36.871
After you.

32:37.246 --> 32:39.791
- How's it going, Bobby?
- Careful, or I'll tell you.

32:43.378 --> 32:45.004
Monkey's coming
off your back, Arthur.

32:45.922 --> 32:50.468
IAB tail made Drucker emptying
his safe deposit box a couple hours ago.

32:50.635 --> 32:51.678
He's ready to book.

32:51.678 --> 32:53.346
- They're ready to move on him.
- They tell you when?

32:53.513 --> 32:57.517
They don't set their watches with me,
Arthur. My impression? Pretty quick.

32:59.435 --> 33:03.439
Downside, they wanna make the collar here.

33:16.285 --> 33:19.122
I got a couple things upstairs.
Then you're going to Central Booking.

33:19.497 --> 33:21.541
You want something?
Some cigarettes.

33:22.250 --> 33:24.669
Kool kings.
I'll send 'em in.

33:24.919 --> 33:27.005
Who's that? That lousy aim Jerry?

33:27.213 --> 33:29.173
Oh, there's the voice that ruined my life!

33:29.382 --> 33:31.634
Shut up over there. You got
your own problems, Jerry.

33:31.718 --> 33:32.719
Is he getting out?

33:32.844 --> 33:35.263
He's getting out, isn't he?
Welshes on a bet,

33:35.596 --> 33:37.306
sells beat dope, and I'm going away?

33:37.390 --> 33:40.560
Yeah, we're harder on murder
than we are on bad debts.

33:41.436 --> 33:44.188
Hey, if they don't have
any Kools, get me any menthol.

33:44.355 --> 33:46.941
Yo, Detective, sir.
What?

33:47.358 --> 33:50.653
- Uh, when am I gettin' out?
- In a little while.

33:50.778 --> 33:51.821
Tonight?
- Yeah.

33:52.280 --> 33:54.615
Hey, is Holly around,
or is she on the other side?

34:03.624 --> 34:05.626
The girl that you put
in that dryer, Howie?

34:06.210 --> 34:08.379
Made bets on her like
you were flipping a coin?

34:08.504 --> 34:10.423
And then he welshed!
- Shut up!

34:12.759 --> 34:14.093
You wanna do yourself some good?

34:15.470 --> 34:17.889
- Yeah.
- You stay away from her.

34:19.182 --> 34:20.224
All right. Bet.

34:20.433 --> 34:22.393
And when I get out,
I'm gonna make some changes.

34:22.477 --> 34:26.230
So you ain't gotta hit me with a bus.
All those changes, Howie,

34:27.231 --> 34:29.525
you try real hard about Holly.

34:40.453 --> 34:43.039
Like monkeys in a zoo.

34:43.164 --> 34:45.917
All they needed was a bag of peanuts.
Who was that?

34:46.209 --> 34:49.670
- The skells from that Laundromat homicide.
- How's the girl?

34:49.796 --> 34:51.714
I'm gonna cut her loose.
You got any aspirin?

34:51.923 --> 34:53.049
Yeah, in there.

35:00.098 --> 35:02.475
Fancy says the rat squad's
coming for this guy.

35:03.476 --> 35:05.228
- Coming here?
- That's what Fancy says.

35:16.280 --> 35:19.826
- Was there a note?
- No, they didn't find one.

35:21.035 --> 35:22.453
I can't believe the guy killed himself.

35:23.371 --> 35:24.413
Yep.

35:26.040 --> 35:29.627
- Son says he was depressed.
- He say if he was a dicky waver?

35:30.711 --> 35:32.046
That story was bogus.

35:32.797 --> 35:34.799
The old man got his back broke
in an accident.

35:34.966 --> 35:36.551
He had nerve damage. Couldn't get it up.

35:36.801 --> 35:40.638
The guy had to be on the five-yard line
to kill himself over a false complaint.

35:40.805 --> 35:42.682
Yeah, well, this report
put him in the end zone.

35:44.016 --> 35:47.645
Uh-uh. Uh-uh. My wife just put me through
that same hoop.

35:47.812 --> 35:50.398
I'm not beatin' myself up 'cause someone
else can't deal with their situation.

35:50.606 --> 35:52.692
Okay, Drucker.
Separated seven months.

35:52.692 --> 35:54.902
I tell her over and over how it is.
She won't face it.

35:55.069 --> 35:57.071
Tried to give her money,
explain what's gonna happen.

35:57.155 --> 35:58.156
She don't wanna listen.

35:58.322 --> 36:00.783
The two of you probably had
ten, 15 years together, right?

36:00.950 --> 36:04.996
- Maybe a few kids?
- You leave my kids out of this.

36:05.997 --> 36:07.373
I was trying to square her financially.

36:07.498 --> 36:09.584
With your girlfriend's
freshly laundered coke money?

36:09.709 --> 36:11.169
Last I looked, it spends.

36:11.294 --> 36:13.504
And your wife wouldn't take it.
Imagine that.

36:14.338 --> 36:15.590
You listen to me.

36:15.715 --> 36:18.676
I'm gonna do what I'm gonna do.
I'm gonna be on that island...

36:18.885 --> 36:20.261
whether she took the money or not.

36:20.970 --> 36:23.139
Only difference now is, she's not gonna
be able to pay her bills.

36:23.306 --> 36:26.601
She's gonna sit, being the victim,
and the girls don't get taken care of.

36:26.601 --> 36:29.520
- Who you talking to, Ronnie?
- I got a right to be happy.

36:31.314 --> 36:33.649
My mistake is hanging around.
I should've left three months ago.

36:43.326 --> 36:44.660
15th Squad.

36:46.329 --> 36:49.290
Yeah. Just a minute. It's for you.

36:50.333 --> 36:51.334
Two.

36:53.127 --> 36:54.295
Yeah, Drucker.

36:55.630 --> 36:56.672
Hello?

36:59.634 --> 37:00.760
Nobody there.

37:18.527 --> 37:21.656
- Someone cuts hair in there.
- One of the civilian aides.

37:22.490 --> 37:24.075
Howie's gonna be on the street, Holly.

37:24.742 --> 37:28.162
- You wanna take that into account.
- He might be pissed off.

37:28.454 --> 37:30.748
He's just a good guy to stay away from.

37:41.300 --> 37:42.551
Any shot you can kick?

37:44.053 --> 37:45.721
I tried a couple times.

37:47.098 --> 37:48.975
I don't have much stick-to-itiveness.

37:50.893 --> 37:52.937
When you helped us before,
that took some moxie,

37:53.145 --> 37:55.189
and you said things were okay
if no one touched you.

37:55.398 --> 37:56.649
I remember you saying that.

37:56.899 --> 37:58.943
And now, you make your livin'
lettin' people get over you.

37:59.068 --> 38:03.447
- They stuff you in a dryer.
- He told you about that?

38:04.782 --> 38:06.284
Maybe that's why
you're gettin' loaded.

38:06.784 --> 38:08.369
You don't like how you're living, huh?

38:12.123 --> 38:16.794
That, what your uncle
did to you... that leaves marks.

38:17.420 --> 38:20.756
If you get help with that,
maybe you can help yourself with the dope.

38:22.925 --> 38:24.552
I guess I must not want it.

38:25.344 --> 38:26.554
Now, you listen to me.

38:27.596 --> 38:29.181
I made a few calls.

38:31.976 --> 38:34.895
If you reach out, those people know
you might be calling.

38:35.146 --> 38:36.814
Okay, thanks.

38:38.190 --> 38:41.610
You're a young person, Holly.
Nothing's over yet.

38:44.613 --> 38:49.577
- I need to go wash my face again.
- Yeah, sure. Go ahead.

38:54.206 --> 38:56.417
Stay in touch if you feel like it, huh?

39:07.428 --> 39:09.055
Detective.
Hi, John.

39:09.180 --> 39:11.349
- You just coming in?
- Yeah, I'm on late tour.

39:11.640 --> 39:12.933
We miss you downstairs.

39:13.100 --> 39:15.478
Well, at least I'm still
in the same neighborhood. Um...

39:15.811 --> 39:17.563
Do you have
another minute for me?

39:17.855 --> 39:19.690
Uh, sure.

39:25.196 --> 39:26.405
I'm in GOAL.

39:26.739 --> 39:29.658
- The Gay Action League.
- Yeah, close enough.

39:29.825 --> 39:32.328
And I just wanted to let you know,
if you have any reason

39:32.453 --> 39:34.413
to come to the meetings
or you need any information,

39:34.497 --> 39:35.539
I'd be delighted to help.

39:35.873 --> 39:38.918
- Thanks, but I don't need that.
- All right.

39:39.835 --> 39:42.797
- You know, people spread rumors.
- Well, sure, um...

39:44.924 --> 39:46.592
The way it came to me,
you said it yourself.

39:47.093 --> 39:49.762
I said it in a particular situation.
It isn't true.

39:51.222 --> 39:52.890
Do you mind telling me
what the situation was?

39:53.933 --> 39:55.935
Someone wouldn't hear
that I didn't want to go out with him,

39:55.935 --> 39:59.230
- and I ran out of other things to say.
- So you said you were gay?

39:59.688 --> 40:01.399
So I finally said I was gay.

40:03.067 --> 40:07.488
Anyway, this is a list of our meetings.
If you have any interest...

40:08.239 --> 40:10.866
I guess gay people
have problems hearing things too.

40:11.409 --> 40:14.537
I heard you, Detective. It's just a list.

40:34.765 --> 40:38.894
Drucker, let's get this done,
okay? I need your gun.

40:39.812 --> 40:40.813
Uh-uh.

40:41.313 --> 40:44.024
Ronnie, you're under arrest.
It's done. Give me your gun.

40:44.692 --> 40:46.277
No. Uh-uh.

40:47.486 --> 40:50.072
Ronnie, take it easy.
You got IAB all over you.

40:50.531 --> 40:51.866
- I'm gettin' out of here.
- No, no, you're not.

40:52.450 --> 40:54.910
- I'm not? The hell I'm not!
- Gun!

40:56.370 --> 40:59.540
- Don't be stupid!
- I'm not stupid. I know where I'm going.

40:59.665 --> 41:01.625
You don't make the stairs!
This ends one way!

41:01.709 --> 41:03.961
Ronnie, he's right. You wanna walk out
of here, just drop the gun. All right?

41:04.295 --> 41:06.589
I'm going to Barbados.
Just stand the hell back.

41:06.797 --> 41:09.300
- Come on, Ronnie. Stop talking crazy.
- Put your weapon down!

41:09.300 --> 41:11.719
- I got a right to be happy.
- Give it up, Ronnie!

41:13.429 --> 41:14.847
Don't move!

41:32.239 --> 41:34.617
- You had to do that in here?
- Don't start that crap.

41:35.201 --> 41:37.870
We're wrong if we collar you
at home. We're wrong if we do it in court.

41:38.037 --> 41:39.955
We're wrong if we do it in public.
You tell me where we're supposed to do it.

41:40.039 --> 41:41.582
- Hey!
- Let it go, Bobby.

41:41.707 --> 41:43.209
I'm calling an ambulance.

41:43.918 --> 41:45.002
Doesn't need an ambulance.

41:46.504 --> 41:48.547
We need an ambulance,
15th Squad.

41:49.298 --> 41:50.883
Get me something
to put these in.

41:54.136 --> 41:55.763
They never think
it's gonna happen.

41:56.180 --> 41:57.765
They always think that they got more time.

41:57.973 --> 41:59.683
Oh, yeah. You should be a shrink, Martens.

42:00.476 --> 42:02.311
You ever figured maybe part
of them don't want to go?

42:32.925 --> 42:35.427
Tell Frankie that floor needs
to be cleaned and disinfected.

42:35.511 --> 42:37.012
He's just waitin'
on Crime Scene to finish up.

42:37.137 --> 42:38.681
Yeah, they're bringing him down
in a minute.

42:38.806 --> 42:41.517
What the hell they doing up there, Lieu?
They figure they're solving a mystery?

42:41.517 --> 42:44.853
- They just wrapped it up.
- They could've given him a chance.

42:45.187 --> 42:48.148
He's upstairs to make the phone call
to tell them the situation.

42:48.274 --> 42:51.026
- Was this guy ever a good cop?
- Couldn't really tell.

42:51.193 --> 42:55.197
Yeah. All I know,
he wound up throwin' shots in the squad.

43:00.869 --> 43:02.871
- Is the press outside?
- Yeah, there's a lot of press.

43:02.997 --> 43:05.791
Hold that gurney in here.
Bring the ambulance around.

43:06.792 --> 43:10.254
15 Base to Central "K."
<i>Go ahead, 15 Base.</i>

43:10.379 --> 43:13.257
- Tell the bus to pull around...
- Girlfriend had him half crazy, huh?

43:14.383 --> 43:17.511
I'll tell ya. You show me
any broad walking forward,

43:17.636 --> 43:19.013
I'll show you what rules the world.

43:19.013 --> 43:21.557
You know, he never said he was taking
the girlfriend with him.

43:21.974 --> 43:23.642
Maybe she didn't even know
where he was going.

43:23.851 --> 43:25.686
Maybe she was just workin' him
for protection.

43:25.811 --> 43:28.314
Maybe he thought he was taking her,
and she'd have stood him up.

43:28.480 --> 43:31.400
Anyway, I wasn't that eager
to get to know him better.
