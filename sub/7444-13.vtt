00:06.101 --> 00:08.057
It's a jungle out there.

00:16.381 --> 00:18.531
It's a jungle out there.

00:37.021 --> 00:39.012
It's a jungle out there.

01:40.981 --> 01:43.449
Police! Don't move!
Police! Get down!

01:46.301 --> 01:47.986
Tell your mate Carl Williams

01:48.021 --> 01:49.501
that we're shutting down
all his cookhouses.

01:49.536 --> 01:51.146
Tell that fat prick
I'm not gonna stop

01:51.181 --> 01:53.341
until he's begging for change
outside of Flinders Street Station.

01:53.376 --> 01:55.411
You got that?

01:57.101 --> 01:58.906
Fuck that
fucking Steve Owen.

01:58.941 --> 02:01.266
You gotta do something
about him, Carl.

02:01.301 --> 02:04.611
And fuck you too, you little
fucking faggot. Get out!

02:06.101 --> 02:08.061
Talking about my
fucking lifestyle here.

02:08.096 --> 02:09.906
Message to you, Owen.

02:09.941 --> 02:13.461
You better keep your door locked,
'cause I'm coming for you, prick.

02:13.496 --> 02:16.533
I'm gonna chop you up.
Chop, chop, chop, chop, chop.

02:18.301 --> 02:21.341
Gonna chop up your girlfriend too,
while I'm at it.

02:21.376 --> 02:23.556
If Steve Owen comes looking for me,

02:23.591 --> 02:25.737
there's a gun under the pillow.

02:33.021 --> 02:36.181
If you don't talk to us,
someone else will get in first.

02:36.216 --> 02:38.638
I don't dog. Never have, never will.

02:38.673 --> 02:41.026
We know
you've got information.

02:41.061 --> 02:45.901
So why don't you stop wasting
our time, and spit it out?

02:45.936 --> 02:48.461
If you help us get certain
people off the streets,

02:48.496 --> 02:50.438
you'll be doing yourself a huge favour.

02:50.473 --> 02:52.346
I wouldn't leave it too long,

02:52.381 --> 02:54.741
'cause someone else will jump
into the queue ahead of you.

02:54.776 --> 02:58.131
I'll just take a moment
to remind you of your priors.

02:59.221 --> 03:02.346
Rape, assault with intent...

03:02.381 --> 03:04.666
Message to you, Owen.

03:04.701 --> 03:07.821
You'd better keep your door locked,
'cause I'm coming for you, prick.

03:07.856 --> 03:10.460
I'm gonna chop you up.
Chop, chop, chop, chop, chop.

03:12.261 --> 03:14.461
Gonna chop up your girlfriend too,
while I'm at it.

03:17.341 --> 03:18.979
Hey.

03:20.581 --> 03:22.014
Hey.

03:23.901 --> 03:25.666
What?

03:25.701 --> 03:28.421
Carl Williams has made
death threats against me...

03:28.456 --> 03:30.186
<i>... and you.</i>

03:30.221 --> 03:33.261
He knows about me?
No, he didn't mention you by name.

03:33.296 --> 03:36.301
Well, does he know where we live?
No. I don't think so...

03:36.336 --> 03:38.118
I don't think he's serious.
Typical Carl bull...

03:38.153 --> 03:39.866
You don't think he knows,
but you're not sure?

03:39.901 --> 03:42.021
I don't think we have anything
to worry about, realistically.

03:42.056 --> 03:44.638
He kills people, Steve.
That's what you told me.

03:44.673 --> 03:47.221
He grabs handfuls of cash
out of his money sack

03:47.256 --> 03:48.706
and then gives it to murderers...

03:48.741 --> 03:51.961
That's why I think it's best
if you move home with your parents.

03:51.996 --> 03:55.181
What? No. I want to be with you.
Susan, this is not a bloody debate.

03:55.216 --> 03:57.341
You go home, you pack your things,
you leave tonight.

03:57.376 --> 03:59.730
Until this thing is over.

04:01.621 --> 04:03.386
What a fucking mess.

04:03.421 --> 04:06.652
That's just vandalism, that is.
Phew.

04:09.941 --> 04:12.581
How many kitchens have they
closed down now, Carl?

04:12.616 --> 04:14.541
When we've done Condello,

04:14.576 --> 04:16.178
we do Owen.

04:22.021 --> 04:23.946
Who's gonna put
their hand up for that?

04:23.981 --> 04:27.261
Carl, Steve Owen is a jack.
I know he's a jack, Michael.

04:27.296 --> 04:31.261
He's after me. Been coming
after me for nine years.

04:31.296 --> 04:33.106
We kill Owen,

04:33.141 --> 04:35.894
we put evidence on him proving
he's corrupt, Purana collapses.

04:36.981 --> 04:40.146
When do we do Condello?

04:40.181 --> 04:43.066
As soon as I get the cash together.

04:43.101 --> 04:47.541
May 2004,
the Carlton Crew was all but wiped out.

04:47.576 --> 04:50.026
Carl had murdered
or ordered the murders

04:50.061 --> 04:52.421
of both Moran boys,
as well as their dad, Lewis.

04:52.456 --> 04:55.378
Elder statesman
Graham Kinniburgh was dead,

04:55.413 --> 04:58.266
and the boss, Mick Gatto,
he was in jail.

04:58.301 --> 05:01.666
Which only left the money man,
Mario Condello.

05:01.701 --> 05:06.221
He was the last man standing
between Carl and a complete victory.

05:06.256 --> 05:09.896
And he was starting to feel
distinctly nervous.

05:20.821 --> 05:22.937
Don't be gentle.

05:56.901 --> 05:58.866
"I'm gonna chop you up, Owen."

05:58.901 --> 06:01.101
I am worried about it,
and so should you be.

06:01.136 --> 06:02.546
Yeah. Look, it's just hot air, boss.

06:02.581 --> 06:04.786
Just means we're getting to him.
Means I'm getting to him.

06:04.821 --> 06:07.221
It's grounds for taking him off
the street. You're aware of that?

06:07.256 --> 06:11.737
We're ahead of the game for once.
Let's not let it slip now.

06:12.941 --> 06:15.541
Promise me you'll upgrade your
domestic security arrangements.

06:15.576 --> 06:17.826
No worries.

06:17.861 --> 06:19.906
Listen, um, I was thinking,

06:19.941 --> 06:24.101
maybe it's a good idea to get
someone inside the Condello camp.

06:30.621 --> 06:32.426
G'day, Tibor.

06:32.461 --> 06:35.981
Detectives Lowe and McManus,
Brunswick detectives.

06:36.016 --> 06:38.078
Mind if we take
a look over the car?

06:38.113 --> 06:40.087
Well, as a matter
of fact, I bloody do.

06:40.122 --> 06:42.061
Got a warrant?
Don't need one.

06:42.096 --> 06:43.506
Under the Firearms Act,

06:43.541 --> 06:45.706
Drugs, Poisons and
Controlled Substances Act,

06:45.741 --> 06:48.541
and the Control of Weapons Act,
we're entitled to search,

06:48.576 --> 06:50.078
provided we've got
reasonable suspicion

06:50.113 --> 06:51.546
you're carrying prohibited articles.

06:51.581 --> 06:53.781
And we're very suspicious,
let me tell you.

06:53.816 --> 06:56.249
Step back, mate.

07:05.581 --> 07:07.721
Oh, shit.

07:07.756 --> 07:09.748
15 years.

07:09.783 --> 07:11.706
Bloody hell.

07:11.741 --> 07:13.777
How would your family
cope with that?

07:17.021 --> 07:19.826
What if I told you
I could make it all go away?

07:19.861 --> 07:23.741
I could write what they call
a 'letter of comfort' to the DPP

07:23.776 --> 07:26.461
asking him not to proceed
with the charges.

07:26.496 --> 07:28.866
Oh, I see.

07:28.901 --> 07:32.421
This is gonna cost me money.
No. I don't want money.

07:32.456 --> 07:35.413
I want you to tell me
something I don't know.

07:45.061 --> 07:48.221
Mario's looking for someone
to knock Carl Williams.

07:48.256 --> 07:50.706
Give me a name.

07:50.741 --> 07:53.226
He hasn't found anybody yet.

07:53.261 --> 07:55.501
Tell me about this writing thing.
No, hang on.

07:55.536 --> 07:57.261
You gotta give me something solid -

07:57.296 --> 07:59.746
a name, a how, a where.

07:59.781 --> 08:01.706
What, so you can be there to stop it?

08:01.741 --> 08:04.501
Get yourself a nice, juicy arrest?
Get your face on television?

08:04.536 --> 08:06.898
There are blokes out there
trying to kill him, Tibor.

08:06.933 --> 08:09.261
I'm trying to get him
off the street, save his life.

08:09.296 --> 08:10.933
I'm actually doing your job for you.

08:15.861 --> 08:18.306
Alright.

08:18.341 --> 08:21.492
What if I put my hand up
for it, told him I'd do it?

08:26.501 --> 08:29.777
Would he believe you?
He trusts me.

08:32.461 --> 08:36.480
Well, you'd have to wear a wire,
record the conversation.

08:36.515 --> 08:40.500
A wire? Mario catches me
with a fucking wire, I'm dead.

08:41.701 --> 08:44.461
But I reckon
it's better than 15 years.

08:44.496 --> 08:47.186
Meanwhile,
I had my own job to do.

08:47.221 --> 08:51.533
I had to find someone with the guts
to testify against Carl Williams.

08:56.141 --> 08:59.417
You sure that's a good idea?
Just don't tell Garry.

09:05.701 --> 09:07.692
This is Senior Detective Carpenter.

09:12.101 --> 09:13.681
What are their names?

09:13.716 --> 09:15.388
How have you been?

09:15.423 --> 09:17.026
Do you need anything?

09:17.061 --> 09:19.441
10 minutes alone with
your puppies would be nice.

09:19.476 --> 09:21.821
Keep that up and I'll bounce
your head off the wall.

09:21.856 --> 09:23.986
The best legal advice money can buy.

09:24.021 --> 09:25.666
Isn't that what
your friend promised you?

09:25.701 --> 09:30.146
I didn't see any QCs' names
in the visitors' book.

09:30.181 --> 09:33.201
Now, we know you were only the driver
in the Michael Marshall murder.

09:33.236 --> 09:36.221
The other guy was the shooter.
And we know you were paid for the hit.

09:36.256 --> 09:39.138
All we want to know is who paid you.

09:39.173 --> 09:41.986
Just two words, that's all we need,

09:42.021 --> 09:44.701
and your future's looking
a whole heap brighter.

09:44.736 --> 09:46.626
Dogs don't last five minutes.

09:46.661 --> 09:48.461
We'll put you into witness security.

09:53.501 --> 09:55.181
So tell me, honey.
Yeah?

09:55.216 --> 09:56.918
What's your cup size?

09:56.953 --> 09:58.621
Oh, you fucking grub.

09:58.656 --> 10:00.339
C.

10:02.301 --> 10:04.178
What's yours?

10:23.621 --> 10:25.186
What did he say?

10:25.221 --> 10:27.421
He refused to actually say
the words 'Carl Williams',

10:27.456 --> 10:28.946
but there's no doubt.

10:28.981 --> 10:30.866
It's gonna be tough
getting the creep to testify.

10:30.901 --> 10:33.541
I don't mind working on him.
Dave and I can handle it.

10:33.576 --> 10:36.214
Yep.
OK. Done.

10:39.341 --> 10:39.626
Now, by law,

10:39.661 --> 10:40.786
Now, by law,

10:40.821 --> 10:44.101
you're required to turn the unit
on and off yourself, like so.

10:44.136 --> 10:45.986
This goes in your pocket, alright?

10:46.021 --> 10:48.346
And keep it on your person
at all time.

10:48.381 --> 10:51.981
But don't rush it. Just wait
for the right moment, OK?

10:52.016 --> 10:53.506
The right moment?

10:53.541 --> 10:54.986
Look, you've got two tasks -

10:55.021 --> 10:59.021
one, convince him
you're the right man for the job, OK?

10:59.056 --> 11:00.932
And two...

11:02.301 --> 11:04.581
<i>... he has to pay for it up-front.</i>

11:04.616 --> 11:06.826
Otherwise it's just talk.

11:06.861 --> 11:09.346
You've got no right offering
something you can't deliver.

11:09.381 --> 11:12.061
Got him between a rock and
a hard place. Now we're in business.

11:12.096 --> 11:13.586
You cannot usurp the DPP.

11:13.621 --> 11:16.781
All you can do is ask him to
consider how helpful a man has been.

11:16.816 --> 11:19.941
I know what you're trying to do...
It's a means to an end, alright?

11:19.976 --> 11:21.586
The end never justifies
the means, Steve.

11:21.621 --> 11:24.141
The process has to be lawful
and correct the whole time,

11:24.176 --> 11:26.661
otherwise you just jeopardise
everyone else's hard work.

11:26.696 --> 11:28.261
You shouldn't need
to be reminded of that.

11:28.296 --> 11:30.466
I'm trying to save a man's life, OK?

11:30.501 --> 11:33.181
For Christ's sake, boss,
I just want to stop this fucking war.

11:33.216 --> 11:35.146
Don't use that language to me.

11:35.181 --> 11:37.775
There's a right way
to do things and a wrong way.

12:26.981 --> 12:29.861
Jesus was a man of peace, right?

12:29.896 --> 12:31.306
He was.

12:31.341 --> 12:33.571
Why do you ask?
You thinking of joining up?

12:35.581 --> 12:38.146
Unlike me, I mean.

12:38.181 --> 12:40.541
I'm a man of war, Mario,

12:40.576 --> 12:42.452
a man of violence.

12:47.021 --> 12:50.457
Been thinking about
your problem - Carl Williams.

12:54.341 --> 12:56.941
You want someone to off the fat boy,

12:56.976 --> 13:00.181
I'm ready to step up.

13:03.781 --> 13:06.106
You?

13:06.141 --> 13:08.177
Who can you trust?

13:18.821 --> 13:21.778
You ever
killed a man before?

13:21.813 --> 13:24.736
Gotta start somewhere.

13:34.261 --> 13:36.456
It'd be an honour to do him for you.

13:55.221 --> 13:57.052
OK.

14:01.341 --> 14:04.001
50 for the job,

14:04.036 --> 14:06.626
20 to start.

14:06.661 --> 14:08.946
Forget it, Mario.

14:08.981 --> 14:13.181
I've done my research.
I know what the market rate is.

14:13.216 --> 14:15.575
150 G's,

14:15.610 --> 14:17.935
50 to start.

14:25.381 --> 14:28.426
150...

14:28.461 --> 14:30.213
<i>... it is.</i>

14:43.821 --> 14:46.386
This is crap. Can't hear a thing.

14:46.421 --> 14:49.541
He agreed on a fee.
He gave me the green light.

14:49.576 --> 14:51.106
Nah, doesn't matter.

14:51.141 --> 14:53.741
You've got to get him
to hand over serious cash.

14:53.776 --> 14:56.341
Listen, these Carlton boys,
they never pay up.

14:56.376 --> 14:58.618
And if they do,
they're never on time.

14:58.653 --> 15:00.861
If he wants Williams dead, he'll pay.

15:00.896 --> 15:03.541
Now, you think about it, Tibor.

15:03.576 --> 15:06.101
15 years.

15:11.221 --> 15:12.654
Mmm.

15:17.061 --> 15:19.319
Hah. Having fun?

15:19.354 --> 15:21.578
Take five, Bunny.

15:26.381 --> 15:29.721
How could you not believe

15:29.756 --> 15:33.061
in a good and benevolent God?

15:33.096 --> 15:34.892
Unbelievable.

15:43.581 --> 15:46.501
Listen, I've been thinking.

15:46.536 --> 15:48.571
Hmm?

15:50.981 --> 15:54.186
I'll need a disguise.
What?

15:54.221 --> 15:56.266
When I do the hit,
I'll need a disguise.

15:56.301 --> 15:59.501
What are you, an international man
of mystery now, huh?

15:59.536 --> 16:02.538
I've got nothing
to hide under, Mario.

16:05.741 --> 16:07.901
And I want to leave
the country straightaway.

16:07.936 --> 16:09.466
I'll need a passport.

16:09.501 --> 16:12.561
Go to the post office.
Get an application form.

16:12.596 --> 16:15.208
In another name.
Costs money - 20-odd grand.

16:15.243 --> 16:17.821
I'll add it to the balance
when you deliver.

16:17.856 --> 16:19.459
I'd really like it now, Mario.

16:21.701 --> 16:24.466
I'm a little short this week.

16:24.501 --> 16:28.255
You get the document.
I'll pay you back.

16:31.581 --> 16:35.130
You mean to tell me you haven't
got 20 grand in the case?

16:37.061 --> 16:38.841
So you don't think
I'm good for this?

16:38.876 --> 16:40.586
That's not what I said.
Nah, hang on.

16:40.621 --> 16:44.181
Wait. You don't think
that I'm good for this?

16:44.216 --> 16:46.706
Huh?

16:46.741 --> 16:49.494
Fuck... you.

16:54.581 --> 16:56.146
I want
six months living expenses,

16:56.181 --> 17:00.141
plus a university degree in
some kind of computer engineering

17:00.176 --> 17:02.861
and a matching resume
with bona fide referees.

17:02.896 --> 17:04.986
Honours degrees,
international prizes...

17:05.021 --> 17:07.941
Reality check, mate.
You're between a rock and a hard place.

17:07.976 --> 17:09.665
You're not getting out of jail.

17:09.701 --> 17:11.546
DPP's not throwing away
a murder charge.

17:11.580 --> 17:14.820
The best thing you can hope for
is a reduction in your sentence.

17:14.856 --> 17:16.746
How much?

17:16.781 --> 17:18.226
Depends how good your info is

17:18.261 --> 17:20.421
and how charitable the judge
is feeling on the day,

17:20.455 --> 17:22.580
but you're looking at
12 on the bottom, maybe 14.

17:22.616 --> 17:24.826
Maybe I don't know anything.
Exactly.

17:24.861 --> 17:27.580
Anyone can write 'CW'
on a table, can't they?

17:27.616 --> 17:29.014
Does not mean a thing.

17:30.301 --> 17:32.106
If you don't help yourself,

17:32.141 --> 17:34.141
you'll never breathe free air again.

17:34.176 --> 17:35.986
Why carry the can on your own?

17:36.021 --> 17:38.261
It wasn't your idea
to kill anyone, was it?

17:38.296 --> 17:40.466
You could chop years
off your sentence.

17:40.501 --> 17:43.201
I like it in here just fine.
Bullshit you do.

17:43.236 --> 17:45.901
Three square meals a day,
plenty of exercise,

17:45.936 --> 17:48.058
telly, no bills to pay -

17:48.093 --> 17:49.956
it's fucking paradise.

17:49.991 --> 17:51.819
If you change your mind...

17:57.741 --> 17:59.386
You know,

17:59.421 --> 18:02.333
I'd have thought your mum might
like to see you free again one day.

18:07.661 --> 18:10.261
I'm a man of war, Mario,

18:10.296 --> 18:12.186
a man of violence.

18:12.221 --> 18:14.661
I want to leave the country
straight afterwards.

18:14.696 --> 18:17.106
Costs money - 20-odd grand.

18:17.141 --> 18:20.656
You mean to tell me you haven't
got 20 grand in the suitcase?

18:21.781 --> 18:24.534
You want someone to off the fat boy.
Who can you trust?

18:26.581 --> 18:29.141
Who can you trust? Who can you trust?

18:29.176 --> 18:31.701
Who can you trust?
Who can you trust?

18:35.861 --> 18:37.772
# Ah, yeah

18:42.181 --> 18:45.014
# Well, come on

18:49.741 --> 18:53.081
# Well, every time that I see you

18:53.116 --> 18:56.088
# It leaves me feeling, oh, so blue

18:56.123 --> 18:59.572
# Knowing that you
used to be all mine

18:59.607 --> 19:03.021
# Still got my friends
and I got some time

19:03.056 --> 19:05.341
# Driving round your neighbourhood

19:05.376 --> 19:07.158
# I'll burn it up

19:07.193 --> 19:08.906
# You know I should

19:08.941 --> 19:11.694
# Burn it up
Burn it up... #

19:13.301 --> 19:14.814
Hey.

19:18.021 --> 19:22.101
Michael.
What's the big emergency?

19:22.136 --> 19:24.854
Condello, mate. It's on.

19:26.981 --> 19:29.370
Whoo-hoo!
Hah-hah-hah!

19:33.181 --> 19:34.614
Yeah.

19:37.261 --> 19:38.786
What's the plan?

19:38.821 --> 19:42.501
Condello, he walks his dog
every morning through the cemetery.

19:42.536 --> 19:43.946
Now...

19:43.981 --> 19:48.221
<i>... when that little pooch
stops for a popper -</i>

19:48.256 --> 19:49.458
bang!

19:49.493 --> 19:50.626
Simple.

19:50.661 --> 19:53.861
Good doggy. Bang!

19:58.741 --> 20:00.174
Let's go.

20:03.861 --> 20:05.266
I thought Mario Condello

20:05.301 --> 20:07.266
had moved into
an apartment in the CBD.

20:07.301 --> 20:09.641
He has. He goes home at
the weekends to visit the family.

20:09.676 --> 20:11.981
If we let Michael Thorneycroft
and this other bloke...

20:12.016 --> 20:13.426
What's his name?
Sean Sonnet.

20:13.461 --> 20:16.441
If we let them run, we might get
fat boy on conspiracy to murder.

20:16.476 --> 20:19.421
The only way we'll get that to stick
is to catch them in the act.

20:19.456 --> 20:21.341
I realise that, Garry.
You have to prove intent.

20:21.376 --> 20:23.106
Garry, I was in school that day too.

20:23.141 --> 20:25.201
We're gonna need
24-hour surveillance, OK?

20:25.236 --> 20:27.226
We need LDs, Tls,
trackers in the cars...

20:27.261 --> 20:30.890
Got it. But just don't lose them.
Don't drop the ball now.

20:43.221 --> 20:45.177
What's the matter?
Where's my gun?

20:46.661 --> 20:48.106
What do you mean?

20:48.141 --> 20:51.258
The gun that I keep in here
to protect myself, Tibor.

20:58.421 --> 21:00.226
What are you doing?

21:00.261 --> 21:01.826
No, the question is
what are you doing?

21:01.861 --> 21:04.706
Or more to the point,
who are you doing it for?

21:04.741 --> 21:07.861
You working for Williams, huh?
You taking money from Carl?

21:07.896 --> 21:09.918
Why would I take money
off somebody who was...

21:09.953 --> 21:11.941
To off me - what else?
I know how your mind works.

21:11.976 --> 21:13.506
You take money from Carl
to knock me,

21:13.541 --> 21:15.741
then get a deposit
out of me to knock him.

21:15.776 --> 21:17.186
You think I'd doublecross you?

21:17.221 --> 21:19.661
It's beautiful if it works,
isn't it, just beautiful.

21:19.696 --> 21:21.701
With all the crap
I go through for you,

21:21.736 --> 21:23.638
you insult my integrity?

21:23.673 --> 21:25.847
You fucking Italian ingrate!

21:25.882 --> 21:27.986
You tell me...
Put it away!

21:28.021 --> 21:31.421
Tell me you're not working for Williams.
I want to hear it!

21:31.456 --> 21:35.209
I... want to hear it.

21:37.821 --> 21:40.893
I am not working for the fat boy.

21:42.501 --> 21:44.181
Now just calm down, Mario,

21:44.216 --> 21:46.026
and listen to me.

21:46.061 --> 21:49.478
My job is to protect your life.

21:49.513 --> 21:52.896
And you have my word on that.

21:59.701 --> 22:01.301
Oh, what?
I can't do it.

22:01.336 --> 22:03.417
Yes, you bloody can.

22:05.701 --> 22:07.461
Are you scared or something?

22:07.496 --> 22:09.666
Yeah.

22:09.701 --> 22:12.061
But you wouldn't get it.
Try me.

22:12.096 --> 22:14.421
Forcing me to dog on the bloke.

22:14.456 --> 22:15.866
He's a mate.

22:15.901 --> 22:17.901
Tibor, I'm not gonna force you
to do anything, alright?

22:17.936 --> 22:19.346
I can't.

22:19.381 --> 22:22.781
What I am asking you to do
is to help us.

22:22.816 --> 22:24.386
And why should I?

22:24.421 --> 22:27.936
Because we should stop this thing
before someone else gets killed.

22:33.341 --> 22:34.946
It's the right thing to do.

22:34.981 --> 22:37.621
You think he might go feral, knock
Williams, take the money and scram?

22:37.656 --> 22:40.101
I wanna know what he's doing
every minute. I don't trust him.

22:40.136 --> 22:42.266
Exactly. Now, this is
a monster you created.

22:42.301 --> 22:44.541
Oh, for Christ's sake. Get real.
Don't talk to me like...

22:44.576 --> 22:45.986
S'cuse me, skipper.

22:46.021 --> 22:47.546
Time for the happy snaps.
Now?!

22:47.581 --> 22:51.221
Right, if we have to do it,
let's do it right. Jackets and ties.

22:51.256 --> 22:54.861
Let's look like professionals
even if we don't always act like one.

22:54.896 --> 22:56.866
Come on, bit of a smile, eh?

22:56.901 --> 22:59.261
There we go, good.
Say cheese, Purana!

22:59.296 --> 23:01.666
Cheese, Purana!
Nice one.

23:01.701 --> 23:03.941
Even bigger. Come on,
bit of ham with that cheese.

23:03.976 --> 23:06.621
One, two, three.
Hey!

23:06.656 --> 23:08.106
Lovely.

23:08.141 --> 23:09.654
Garry?

23:11.941 --> 23:13.626
You OK?

23:13.661 --> 23:16.255
I was, um...

23:21.701 --> 23:23.866
Yeah,
but I'm only asking for 30 grand.

23:23.901 --> 23:26.341
It's a fucking emergency, Carl.
Can't afford it this month.

23:26.376 --> 23:27.786
You've got a shitload here.

23:27.821 --> 23:30.680
I already told you
I can't afford it this month.

23:30.715 --> 23:33.539
The fucking jewellery
won't be on special forever.

23:37.261 --> 23:38.706
Nah.

23:38.741 --> 23:40.226
Hi, mate.

23:40.261 --> 23:44.661
Hey, um... what's in the bag?

23:44.696 --> 23:46.458
100 G's.

23:50.181 --> 23:51.978
Huh.
We're on.

23:53.101 --> 23:55.535
Once the job's done,
you get 200 more.

24:00.181 --> 24:02.346
Mate,

24:02.381 --> 24:05.061
I'm not gonna use you
in the actual hit.

24:05.096 --> 24:06.706
Eh?

24:06.741 --> 24:08.386
Why not?

24:08.421 --> 24:10.106
I can't rely on you.

24:10.141 --> 24:12.781
If you're not stoned, you're asleep.

24:12.816 --> 24:15.458
If you're not asleep, you're stoned.

24:15.493 --> 24:18.101
Sometimes he's asleep AND stoned.

24:18.136 --> 24:20.026
Fuck off!

24:20.061 --> 24:22.141
I want you to source the gun car.

24:22.176 --> 24:25.611
So I'm the vehicle guy?

24:27.261 --> 24:28.694
Cool.

25:00.061 --> 25:02.861
Michael Thorneycroft
just stole a Ford Telstar.

25:02.896 --> 25:05.746
Garry? Game on, mate.

25:05.781 --> 25:07.821
I'm afraid Mr Butterworth's
not available at the moment.

25:07.856 --> 25:09.254
Can I take a message?

25:12.701 --> 25:15.613
Yep, OK. No, I'll get him to call you
as soon as possible.

25:17.261 --> 25:19.181
I want the surveillance team
in on that car.

25:19.216 --> 25:21.066
I want to know where it is
at all times,

25:21.101 --> 25:23.501
who's in it, what they say,
and I don't want any mistakes.

25:31.461 --> 25:34.377
Have we established where Mario's
staying tonight - home or away?

25:34.412 --> 25:37.293
The city apartment. I don't reckon
they'll strike till dawn anyway.

25:38.621 --> 25:40.866
Garry, tucker's up!

25:40.901 --> 25:42.801
Maybe he doesn't like Thai food?

25:42.836 --> 25:44.701
He's not a bloody retard, Todd.

25:44.736 --> 25:46.146
Oi. Oi.

25:46.181 --> 25:47.694
Here you go.

25:49.981 --> 25:52.141
Boss, chow's up.

25:52.176 --> 25:54.266
Boss? JESUS!

25:54.301 --> 25:57.134
C'mon, get in here!
Get a bloody ambulance!

27:06.501 --> 27:09.413
Just been
having a blub in the ladies'.

27:15.541 --> 27:19.216
You know, when they do
the final body count...

27:21.781 --> 27:23.214
...they're not gonna include him.

27:24.261 --> 27:26.146
They should.

27:26.181 --> 27:28.217
This job killed him.

27:29.261 --> 27:31.297
Unless it was the shortbread.

27:42.101 --> 27:44.620
I was gonna have a talk to him
later on too,

27:44.655 --> 27:47.139
just to, you know...
just clear the air.

27:48.901 --> 27:50.459
What about?

27:56.821 --> 28:00.061
Yeah, I might... just head home
for an hour.

28:00.096 --> 28:01.296
See the kids.

28:01.331 --> 28:02.496
Yeah. Course.

28:04.541 --> 28:05.974
OK.

28:28.901 --> 28:30.586
Hello?

28:30.621 --> 28:32.541
It's me.

28:32.576 --> 28:34.426
Hey.

28:34.461 --> 28:37.301
I haven't heard from you in a while.

28:37.336 --> 28:39.826
Yeah, sorry. I've just, um...

28:39.861 --> 28:42.941
Well, it's just been
kinda crazy at work.

28:42.976 --> 28:45.375
Is everything OK?

28:47.381 --> 28:49.736
I just... needed to hear your voice.

28:56.021 --> 28:57.454
Babe.

29:03.421 --> 29:06.021
Just remember, Gregg, do everything
like I said and we'll be cool.

29:06.056 --> 29:08.694
Relax, Seany. I'm cool.
I'm 50 grand cool.

29:09.901 --> 29:11.346
Seany? Seany.

29:11.381 --> 29:13.941
Please, mate. Jesus Christ.

29:20.261 --> 29:22.981
Mobile 1 to Mobile 2.
Come in. Gregg here.

29:25.541 --> 29:28.260
Mobile 1 to Mobile 2,
what the fuck's going on?

29:32.941 --> 29:37.181
Oi. Didn't you hear me?
You're Mobile 2, dickhead.

29:37.216 --> 29:39.946
Flat battery.
You got jumper leads?

29:39.981 --> 29:42.221
What idiot boosts a unit
with a flat battery?

29:42.256 --> 29:44.586
Michael Thorneycroft.

29:44.621 --> 29:47.781
Gregg, have you got jumper leads?
No, I don't, Seany.

29:47.816 --> 29:49.981
Fuck!

29:52.221 --> 29:53.666
What's happened?

29:53.701 --> 29:55.666
Someone's jump-started the Telstar.

29:55.701 --> 29:59.171
Sounds like Sean Sonnet and
a new guy - Gregg someone.

30:07.981 --> 30:10.941
Right. This is the Telstar.
This is Mario's place in Brighton.

30:10.976 --> 30:12.746
This is his apartment in the city.

30:12.781 --> 30:14.306
Somewhere between here
and these two locations,

30:14.341 --> 30:16.546
we're gonna have to stop them
with guns in their hands.

30:16.581 --> 30:18.941
They might have changed their plans.
We gotta cover ALL bases.

30:18.976 --> 30:21.154
Crazy Eyes wants another chat.

30:21.189 --> 30:23.332
Do it, yep. Take Dave. Go.

30:27.421 --> 30:30.621
There. They're going south,
to Brighton. I'm going out there.

30:30.656 --> 30:32.341
Jeremy, get your crew, mate.
We're going.

30:32.376 --> 30:34.541
Let's go.
Where to?

30:34.576 --> 30:35.986
Home. Brighton.

30:36.021 --> 30:38.226
Dog's booked in
for vaccinations this morning.

30:38.261 --> 30:40.901
Listen, my advice would be
to stay put for a couple of days.

30:40.936 --> 30:42.661
Just cancel the vet.

30:42.696 --> 30:44.935
Mario...

30:44.970 --> 30:47.174
Listen, I...

30:48.221 --> 30:50.106
Call it a premonition, OK?

30:50.141 --> 30:55.135
But... I had a really bad dream
about you last night.

30:57.261 --> 31:01.777
Just... just stay put
for a couple of days.

31:07.581 --> 31:09.586
You're with Derryn Hinch.

31:09.621 --> 31:12.981
We've all heard about the spate of
gangland murders in recent years.

31:13.016 --> 31:15.741
We've seen the gangsters' funerals
on television -

31:15.776 --> 31:18.478
those offensive,
ostentatious festivals

31:18.513 --> 31:21.287
of muscle, phoney emotions
and bad taste.

31:21.322 --> 31:24.026
Well, yesterday we lost
one of the good guys.

31:24.061 --> 31:27.901
Detective Inspector Garry Butterworth
of the Purana Taskforce

31:27.936 --> 31:29.786
died suddenly last night.

31:29.821 --> 31:32.761
Typically, he was at his desk
when he died,

31:32.796 --> 31:35.666
doing the job
that he'd dedicated his life to.

31:35.701 --> 31:40.901
Garry Butterworth joined
the police force as a cadet in 1978.

31:40.936 --> 31:44.341
He worked the tough streets
of Brunswick and St Kilda

31:44.376 --> 31:46.506
as a uniformed copper.

31:46.541 --> 31:49.421
His skills as an investigator
were soon recognised

31:49.456 --> 31:52.538
and Garry rose through
the ranks of Homicide

31:52.573 --> 31:55.621
where his professionalism
and his tenacity,

31:55.656 --> 31:58.781
thoroughness and absolute integrity

31:58.816 --> 32:00.537
became watchwords.

32:00.572 --> 32:02.259
He'll be sadly missed.

32:07.701 --> 32:09.586
They've stopped outside
Brighton Cemetery.

32:09.621 --> 32:12.398
Steve, can you confirm
that Condello is in town?

32:12.433 --> 32:15.176
Yeah, boss.
Give me a sec, I'll call him.

32:17.381 --> 32:21.221
Tibor, you need to tell us
what's going on, mate.

32:21.256 --> 32:22.859
Call me back.

32:32.261 --> 32:33.694
Right, we're in position.

32:40.421 --> 32:42.093
We're in position now.

32:49.461 --> 32:50.946
Who paid you for the hit?

32:50.981 --> 32:53.381
I can't talk
while Carl's still out and about.

32:53.416 --> 32:55.306
I open my mouth,
he'll come after me.

32:55.341 --> 32:58.219
There are guys in here
who'll stab you for a packet of Twisties.

32:59.261 --> 33:00.826
You lock him up first,
then I'll talk.

33:00.861 --> 33:03.011
How can we lock him up
without your evidence?

33:09.581 --> 33:11.621
I was the driver
for the Marshall job.

33:11.656 --> 33:14.666
And I did the Jason job.

33:14.701 --> 33:16.466
Drove the shooter to the car park,

33:16.501 --> 33:19.781
dropped him off where we saw Jason
and Pat getting back in the van.

33:19.816 --> 33:22.998
Picked him up after
on the other side of the creek.

33:23.033 --> 33:26.181
Oh, incidentally,
Pat Barbaro was Jason's fault.

33:26.216 --> 33:28.061
That prick shouldn't have ducked.

33:28.096 --> 33:29.586
Who paid you for the hit?

33:29.621 --> 33:33.661
Come on, just give us a name
and we'll look after you.

33:33.696 --> 33:35.541
Nice decoy, eh?
Sweet.

33:35.576 --> 33:36.986
Couple of lilies.

33:37.021 --> 33:41.101
Him? Him, that bloke over there,
the woggy looking bloke?

33:41.136 --> 33:42.586
Nah, that's not him.

33:42.621 --> 33:45.581
Gee, there's a lot of people around.
Fuckin' too many people around.

33:45.616 --> 33:47.346
Not gonna be able to do this.

33:47.381 --> 33:49.576
We're gonna have to hang about,
get up close to him.

33:51.821 --> 33:53.346
Is that him?

33:53.381 --> 33:56.799
Well, you're looking for a bloke
with a dog, right?

33:56.834 --> 34:00.218
Well, bloke, dog - snap.
Let's go. Come on, mate.

34:21.981 --> 34:23.466
20,000, you said.

34:23.501 --> 34:26.174
For a passport, yeah, 20.

34:28.501 --> 34:30.266
40,000.

34:30.301 --> 34:33.661
Two passports -
one for you, one for me.

34:33.696 --> 34:35.266
For you?

34:35.301 --> 34:39.746
Once the job's done,
I leave the country too.

34:39.781 --> 34:44.696
We meet up overseas and I pay you
the full amount... personally.

34:46.781 --> 34:52.094
Now, you prove to me
you're a man of violence.

35:06.621 --> 35:09.101
Steve, shut these clowns down
before they shoot somebody.

35:09.136 --> 35:11.181
Not yet, boss.
Steve, don't muck about.

35:11.216 --> 35:12.666
Shut the bastards down.

35:12.701 --> 35:14.498
Sorry, missed that, boss.
You're breaking up.

35:17.501 --> 35:20.698
Jesus, they've got the wrong guy.
Steve, they've got the wrong guy!

35:31.181 --> 35:33.426
Mr Khan! G'day, Mr Khan!

35:33.461 --> 35:36.341
What a coincidence seeing you here,
Mr Khan. Mr Imran Khan!

35:36.376 --> 35:38.861
Sorry, you've mistaken me
for someone else.

35:38.896 --> 35:41.466
You've mistaken me for someone...

35:41.501 --> 35:43.617
My name is Mr Abbas.
I know, mate. I know.

35:46.461 --> 35:48.266
Steve, how much intent do you need?

35:48.301 --> 35:50.098
Well, have they mentioned
Carl by name yet?

35:51.141 --> 35:53.181
Well, no, we're still up
shit creek, aren't we?

35:53.216 --> 35:55.261
Forget it, Steve.
Shut the bastards down!

35:55.296 --> 35:57.775
Shit!

36:01.061 --> 36:03.381
Hey, Seany, you nearly popped
the wrong bloke, mate.

36:03.416 --> 36:05.981
You're in this too, mate.
Don't you forget it.

36:06.016 --> 36:07.414
Not as much as you, mate.

36:13.981 --> 36:17.417
Get down! On the ground.
Face down. On the ground.

36:20.461 --> 36:23.066
Who's paying you?
WHO'S PAYING YOU?!

36:23.101 --> 36:26.317
Who's behind it? It was a kill,
wasn't it? Tell me who paid you!

36:26.352 --> 36:29.533
Say his name! Say his name,
you bastard! Say his bloody name!

36:31.861 --> 36:33.089
Argh!

36:35.061 --> 36:37.291
All we wanna know
is who paid you.

36:45.821 --> 36:49.177
Carl Williams gave us
150 grand for the job.

36:51.581 --> 36:54.573
I got 25 for Mark.
Mark?

36:55.741 --> 36:58.741
Mark Moran, C-cup.
Who do you fuckin' think?

36:58.776 --> 37:01.106
I drove. Carl was the shooter.

37:01.141 --> 37:03.478
After he did it,
I raced him across town to a pub

37:03.513 --> 37:05.816
so he could get his fat face
on closed-circuit TV.

37:06.941 --> 37:10.281
But no way
am I getting in a witness box

37:10.316 --> 37:13.621
till Carl's locked up
nice and tight.

37:13.656 --> 37:15.213
You got that?

37:26.741 --> 37:28.618
I thought you'd done a runner on me.

37:29.981 --> 37:31.653
I did.

37:34.261 --> 37:36.491
Good quality this time.

37:37.981 --> 37:41.610
$40,000 for two forged passports
for him and me.

37:43.621 --> 37:45.657
So why'd you come back?

37:48.141 --> 37:50.496
It was the right thing to do.

37:55.781 --> 37:58.426
Hey, thanks for coming in.

37:58.461 --> 38:01.026
Can you deliver a letter for me?

38:01.061 --> 38:03.575
I don't want it going
through the prison office.

38:06.221 --> 38:08.610
Director of Public Prosecutions.

38:10.381 --> 38:12.178
Do you wanna do a deal?

38:14.061 --> 38:17.133
You prepared
to testify against Carl?

38:19.901 --> 38:22.461
He promised me the best lawyers
in town, didn't he?

38:22.496 --> 38:25.466
You reckon I've seen
one of the bastards?

38:25.501 --> 38:29.460
I'm gonna do a deal...
before someone else beats me to it.

38:30.501 --> 38:33.421
You gotta promise me
one thing though.

38:33.456 --> 38:36.341
Promise me
you'll take care of me mum.

38:36.376 --> 38:38.741
Keep her safe.

38:38.776 --> 38:40.174
Sure.

38:41.341 --> 38:44.811
Onya, Jacqui. Thanks.

38:52.301 --> 38:54.735
Garry should be doing this.

38:56.341 --> 38:58.457
Detective Sergeant Owen...

39:00.421 --> 39:02.341
<i>... go get the fat boy.</i>

39:04.581 --> 39:08.146
# Say goodbye... #

39:08.181 --> 39:12.461
Coat buttoned up.
Purana tie knotted sharply, boss.

39:12.496 --> 39:16.077
# And we'll steal

39:16.112 --> 39:19.658
# A lover's song

39:21.101 --> 39:25.066
# How it breaks

39:25.101 --> 39:30.776
# My heart to leave you

39:30.811 --> 39:36.452
# Now the carnival has gone

39:38.101 --> 39:42.581
# Oh, my love, the dawn is... #

39:42.616 --> 39:46.298
Hey, Carl.
Yeah?

39:46.333 --> 39:49.892
# And my tears

39:49.927 --> 39:53.451
# Are falling rain

39:54.501 --> 40:01.771
# For the carnival is over

40:03.021 --> 40:09.176
# We may never meet again

40:11.461 --> 40:14.466
# Like a drum

40:14.501 --> 40:18.501
# My heart was beating

40:18.536 --> 40:22.758
# And your kiss

40:22.793 --> 40:26.981
# Was sweet as wine

40:27.016 --> 40:30.666
# But the joys

40:30.701 --> 40:32.266
# Of love are fleeting... #

40:32.301 --> 40:36.421
Carl Williams,
I'm arresting you for murder.

40:36.456 --> 40:41.541
# For Pierrot and Columbine... #

40:44.101 --> 40:48.781
That's how the gangland war
ended, on a cold day in June 2004,

40:48.816 --> 40:52.261
when Steve Owen
finally shut down Carl Williams.

40:52.296 --> 40:55.238
# This will be

40:55.273 --> 40:58.146
# Our last goodbye

40:58.181 --> 41:00.820
# Though the carnival... #

41:02.741 --> 41:06.861
Carl Williams was convicted
of Michael Marshall's murder in 2006.

41:06.896 --> 41:09.106
In February 2007,

41:09.141 --> 41:12.581
he pleaded guilty to murdering
Jason Moran, Lewis Moran,

41:12.616 --> 41:15.078
another drug dealer
called Mark Mallia

41:15.113 --> 41:17.506
and conspiring
to murder Mario Condello.

41:17.541 --> 41:21.557
He's currently serving
a minimum of 35 years.

41:21.592 --> 41:25.574
In March 2007,
he and Roberta were divorced.

41:27.021 --> 41:30.941
A week into Mario Condello's trial
for conspiring to murder Carl,

41:30.976 --> 41:34.021
he was shot dead by persons unknown.

41:34.056 --> 41:36.378
His file is still open.

41:36.413 --> 41:38.666
Tony Mokbel fled Australia

41:38.701 --> 41:41.641
in the middle of his trial
for cocaine trafficking.

41:41.676 --> 41:44.546
In his absence,
he was sentenced to nine years.

41:44.581 --> 41:49.211
Early in 2007, Danielle McGuire
gave birth to his daughter, Renata.

41:50.261 --> 41:54.301
Today Mick Gatto is a director
of a construction crane company.

41:54.336 --> 41:57.577
He also runs a mediation
and arbitration business.

42:00.261 --> 42:04.573
And as for us, the work
at the Purana Taskforce goes on.
