WEBVTT

00:02.520 --> 00:04.640
-Fa! Fa! Fa!
-How much did that cost?

00:04.720 --> 00:05.720
-Three hundred.
-Nice.

00:05.800 --> 00:06.840
-Is that yours?
-Yep.

00:06.920 --> 00:08.600
-Got it on eBay. 75.
-Gigantic.

00:08.680 --> 00:10.200
-Looking at your knives?
-Hey, Colin.

00:10.280 --> 00:11.920
-All right, Colin?
-I've got a nice one.

00:12.000 --> 00:13.360
-Wow, it's a Gurkha.
-[Colin] Mm.

00:13.440 --> 00:16.520
It's a vintage. Look at the notches
on that. Seen some action, this one has.

00:16.600 --> 00:18.720
-[laughs]
-Right, are we ready to go?

00:18.800 --> 00:21.040
-[Colin] He's not here yet, is he?
-Uh, who do you mean?

00:21.120 --> 00:24.240
[laughs] Yeah, yeah. I told that prick
to make sure he was here at eight sharp.

00:24.320 --> 00:26.720
-Should I give Ray Purchase a call?
-Good idea.

00:27.680 --> 00:28.680
Bingo!

00:30.240 --> 00:33.400
Been trying to pick this pencil up
in my mouth for the last 15 minutes.

00:33.480 --> 00:34.480
Are we good to go?

00:35.240 --> 00:38.280
Hi, Steven. This is Clem H. Fandango.
Can you hear me?

00:38.360 --> 00:42.960
Yeah, I can hear... Whoa, whoa.
Did you just say Clem H. Fandango?

00:43.040 --> 00:44.480
So, you've added an "H" to your name?

00:45.280 --> 00:47.240
You don't think
you were enough of a prat already?

00:47.320 --> 00:49.640
It was Equity's idea.
They told me to change my name,

00:49.720 --> 00:54.120
as there's another actor already,
apparently called Clem Fandango.

00:54.640 --> 00:55.680
But you're not an actor.

00:56.200 --> 00:58.000
Sorry, gonna have to
get this done quickly.

00:58.080 --> 01:00.920
-Colin needs to edit everything by midday.
-You all right, buddy?

01:01.360 --> 01:04.200
I'm Colin Skittles
from Swing Out Spritzer.

01:04.280 --> 01:07.240
Now, there's a certain way
we'd like you to perform the VO.

01:10.680 --> 01:14.800
If you like, buddy,
I can run through it first, as a guide.

01:17.440 --> 01:18.440
Well, go on then.

01:19.120 --> 01:20.120
Brill.

01:21.120 --> 01:24.440
[camp] Hey, guys!
Don't lose your cool this summer.

01:24.520 --> 01:26.520
Be as cool as ice

01:26.600 --> 01:29.560
and enjoy a tall glass of
Tawny Owl Ice Tea.

01:29.640 --> 01:31.040
Terwit-terwoo!

01:31.120 --> 01:32.520
Terwit-terwoo!

01:41.480 --> 01:45.240
[mimics Colin] Hey, guys!
Don't lose your cool this summer.

01:45.320 --> 01:47.160
Be as cool as ice

01:47.240 --> 01:51.680
and enjoy a tall glass of
Tawny Owl Ice Tea.

01:51.760 --> 01:53.280
Terwit-terwoo!

01:53.360 --> 01:55.920
Terwit-terwoo!

01:56.080 --> 01:57.560
All right, buddy?

02:24.440 --> 02:25.920
Brigadoon.

02:26.000 --> 02:29.280
Really? I can't remember
the last musical I saw.

02:29.360 --> 02:32.120
-Cats?
-Cats,  yes! On Drury Lane.

02:32.200 --> 02:35.080
And if I recall, I was so drunk,

02:35.160 --> 02:37.960
I collapsed in my seat
whilst sitting down.

02:38.480 --> 02:42.360
Well, at least you didn't get up and
join in, like Michael Barrymore used to!

02:42.440 --> 02:44.280
He did, didn't he? [laughs]

02:45.320 --> 02:47.120
Talking of theaters, if I were you, Toast,

02:47.200 --> 02:49.360
I'd avoid going past the Garrick,
for a week or two.

02:49.440 --> 02:51.880
Is Ray Purchase dropping his slacks again?

02:51.960 --> 02:54.120
No! They're putting on
a production of  The Graduate.

02:54.200 --> 02:56.880
That, um, ex of yours is playing the lead.

02:56.960 --> 02:59.880
-Who? Maggie Philbin?
-Lorna Wynde.

03:01.600 --> 03:04.800
-[echoes] Lorna Wynde?
-[echoes] Lorna Wynde.

03:05.960 --> 03:09.800
I always thought she was quite pretty
in that over-the-top American way.

03:09.880 --> 03:13.920
You did that awful daytime soap
together in LA.

03:14.000 --> 03:16.120
She had that thing, do you remember,
on close-ups?

03:16.200 --> 03:20.720
She went all cross-eyed whenever her face
came within three feet of a camera.

03:20.800 --> 03:25.120
Really affected her career in television.
That's why she's doing theater these days.

03:25.200 --> 03:27.000
-Lorna Wynde.
-Please, Jane.

03:27.080 --> 03:30.480
Lorna Wynde! She promised
to move back to London with you,

03:30.560 --> 03:32.400
but she didn't show up at the airport.

03:32.480 --> 03:35.600
You were so heartbroken,
you couldn't speak for three weeks.

03:35.680 --> 03:37.480
You were in a terrible state.

03:37.560 --> 03:40.880
You cried so hard,
you followed through in Oddbins.

03:40.960 --> 03:42.880
All right, Jane!

03:42.960 --> 03:45.480
Please! Please stop saying--

03:45.560 --> 03:47.760
Lorna Wynde? Stop saying Lorna Wynde.

03:47.840 --> 03:49.000
-[echoes] Lorna Wynde.
-Yes!

03:49.080 --> 03:51.120
More importantly,
where are we going for lunch?

03:51.200 --> 03:52.400
We'll have to get a wriggle on.

03:52.480 --> 03:55.840
I'm off to Scotland
to visit Tilda Swinton. Ha! Tilda.

03:55.920 --> 03:59.280
Mad as a bag of monkeys,
but tremendous fun.

03:59.360 --> 04:02.080
I'm sorry, Jane.
I've... suddenly lost my appetite.

04:02.800 --> 04:04.720
I'd rather go home,
if it's all the same with you?

04:07.040 --> 04:08.520
Careful, Toast.

04:11.680 --> 04:15.760
The second Jane said she was back in town,
I felt physically sick.

04:15.840 --> 04:17.760
Like I was right there,
back at the airport.

04:17.839 --> 04:20.480
-Right.
-The anguish pulls hard on one, Ed.

04:21.240 --> 04:23.200
Like an anchor, made of white gold.

04:23.280 --> 04:25.920
-Mm.
-My stomach feels like lead.

04:26.000 --> 04:27.400
I've not eaten all day.

04:27.480 --> 04:31.360
Not even been able to go to the toilet
which, as you know, is very unlike me.

04:31.440 --> 04:32.760
[Ed clears throat]

04:33.800 --> 04:35.760
Thanks for the sympathetic ear.

04:35.840 --> 04:39.440
Does a chap good to unload, as it were.

04:40.800 --> 04:42.000
Sorry, I wasn't listening.

04:42.560 --> 04:44.200
What the hell's with the knives?

04:44.280 --> 04:46.400
Jane was waving
one of those around earlier

04:46.480 --> 04:48.440
and those clowns in the studio.

04:48.520 --> 04:50.000
Oh, everyone has knives these days.

04:50.760 --> 04:52.920
Ever since those Tottenham riots.

04:53.000 --> 04:55.240
People need to protect themselves
and their property.

04:55.320 --> 04:57.120
-I haven't got one.
-Maybe you should get one.

04:57.800 --> 05:00.200
By the way, Toast.
I need to talk to you about something.

05:00.280 --> 05:02.120
We're going to have a guest staying here.

05:02.200 --> 05:03.240
Who? Peter Powell?

05:03.680 --> 05:06.000
-No, my niece. Honeysuckle.
-[grunts]

05:06.080 --> 05:07.800
She hasn't been feeling herself lately.

05:07.880 --> 05:10.000
Her mum reckons
she's got a gluten allergy.

05:10.080 --> 05:12.440
Anyway, she's come down to London
to visit a homeopath.

05:12.520 --> 05:14.440
-[laughs]
-She needs somewhere to stay.

05:14.520 --> 05:16.320
What the hell is a homeopath?

05:16.400 --> 05:18.480
Someone who specializes
in alternative medicine.

05:18.560 --> 05:20.360
Ooh! What, like a witch doctor?

05:20.440 --> 05:23.040
I'm pretty skeptical myself,
about this whole homeopathy lark.

05:23.120 --> 05:26.080
Anyway, she's tried everything else,
poor dear, and it hasn't worked.

05:26.160 --> 05:28.160
Anyway, she'll need to sleep
in your bedroom.

05:29.120 --> 05:30.640
Well, where the hell am I gonna go?

05:30.720 --> 05:32.520
Well, presumably on the sofa here.

05:32.600 --> 05:33.920
Is there a sofa here?

05:34.680 --> 05:36.360
-Yeah.
-[snorts]

05:39.080 --> 05:40.720
-Mm, there she is.
-[knocking at door]

05:40.800 --> 05:43.000
-[Ed] Sorry, Toast.
-[gasps]

05:43.080 --> 05:45.360
Just showing Honeysuckle her room.

05:45.960 --> 05:47.320
Steven Toast...

05:47.400 --> 05:49.240
-My niece, Honeysuckle.
-Hello.

05:49.320 --> 05:50.840
[demonic voice] Fuck off and die!

05:52.360 --> 05:53.880
I beg your pardon?

05:53.960 --> 05:57.240
[laughs] Apologies, Toast.
It's the allergy.

05:57.320 --> 05:59.640
Honeysuckle suffered
a negative reaction to something.

05:59.720 --> 06:01.400
I'm so sorry, Mr. Toast.

06:01.480 --> 06:04.200
Like my uncle said,
I haven't been feeling myself lately.

06:04.280 --> 06:06.800
[The Exorcist  style music]

06:06.880 --> 06:10.280
Mm... Hm...

06:10.360 --> 06:11.840
[sighs]

06:11.920 --> 06:13.520
[door opens]

06:16.320 --> 06:17.240
-Oi!
-[yells]

06:17.320 --> 06:20.080
[demonic voice] There's no fucking toilet
paper in the bathroom!

06:20.640 --> 06:23.640
Th... There's some kitchen roll
under the sink!

06:23.720 --> 06:26.280
-[Honeysuckle growls]
-[wails]

06:28.840 --> 06:30.080
What the hell?

06:31.040 --> 06:32.640
Ah. Going somewhere, Toast?

06:32.720 --> 06:35.200
Yeah. I'm gonna move out
for a few days, Ed.

06:35.280 --> 06:37.640
Yes, may be best.
Honeysuckle's a bit of a handful.

06:37.720 --> 06:40.440
The sooner we get her sorted out
with this homeopathy, the better.

06:40.520 --> 06:42.120
-Yes.
-Where are you going?

06:42.200 --> 06:46.000
Um... Francis Bacon has a spare room.
He owes me a few favors.

06:46.080 --> 06:49.120
-Francis Bacon? I thought he was dead.
-Why does everyone say that?

07:00.080 --> 07:05.400
Oh, God! [sobs]

07:09.360 --> 07:11.400
Toast? Is that you?

07:12.160 --> 07:14.080
-Lorna.
-Oh, Toast.

07:14.160 --> 07:16.680
I recognized the streak in your hair
from across the way.

07:16.760 --> 07:19.160
[laughs] That streak.

07:19.240 --> 07:21.920
-Didn't you fall out of a tree?
-Yeah, I fell out of a tree.

07:22.000 --> 07:23.360
I knew I'd see you again.

07:25.120 --> 07:27.920
-Wait, are you crying?
-Crying? Me? Nah.

07:28.000 --> 07:30.400
Toast, I owe you an explanation.

07:30.480 --> 07:34.480
No, you don't.
I can't even remember what happened.

07:34.560 --> 07:36.760
We both know that's not true, Steven.

07:36.840 --> 07:39.800
I bounced back and was fine
within a couple of hours.

07:39.880 --> 07:43.480
If you don't mind,
I'm late for a luncheon.

07:43.560 --> 07:49.040
Oh, Toast. You always were
a lousy poker player. Coffee? My treat?

07:49.120 --> 07:50.200
[sighs]

07:51.440 --> 07:53.400
It is a nice day.

07:53.480 --> 07:56.560
We could get some ice cream. Yes.

07:59.880 --> 08:01.640
Do you have any cigarettes?

08:01.720 --> 08:04.560
You always did like a cigarette
after ice cream.

08:04.640 --> 08:09.040
I don't have any, but somebody left a pipe
in the drawer, next to the Bible.

08:10.320 --> 08:11.640
[Toast] Is that your knife?

08:11.720 --> 08:14.760
Yeah. Everybody told me to bring one
if I was coming to London,

08:14.840 --> 08:18.080
-because of the Tottenham siege.
-Tottenham riots.

08:19.120 --> 08:22.320
You know, I never thought
I'd see you again.

08:22.400 --> 08:24.000
I was in a real bad place.

08:24.080 --> 08:27.320
You ripped me in half, woman.
In bloody half!

08:28.720 --> 08:30.680
I was in a dreadful state.

08:30.760 --> 08:32.440
I know, I heard.

08:32.520 --> 08:35.600
Apparently, you cried so hard,
you followed through in Oddbins.

08:35.679 --> 08:36.760
Yes, I did.

08:39.880 --> 08:43.559
-Shall we? For old times' sake?
-What?

08:43.640 --> 08:46.920
-You know.
-[both laugh]

08:47.000 --> 08:48.840
[Toast laughs] Abraham Lincoln.

08:48.920 --> 08:51.240
Forgotten you'd mastered him.
You do him so well.

08:51.320 --> 08:52.920
Do Bruce Forsyth.

08:53.000 --> 08:55.280
Bruce is easy.
You've just gotta get the chin right.

09:06.160 --> 09:08.480
Oh, this is so much fun.
Let me take a selfie.

09:08.560 --> 09:11.760
-A what?
-A picture. Of us back together.

09:11.840 --> 09:12.840
[camera clicks]

09:12.920 --> 09:15.480
I'm really sorry
I ran out on you, Steven Toast.

09:15.560 --> 09:17.320
-I wanna make it up.
-Leave it, Lorna.

09:17.400 --> 09:20.400
Your backside's writing checks
your mouth just cannot cash.

09:20.480 --> 09:23.440
You must have been real upset
to have followed through in Oddbins.

09:23.520 --> 09:25.480
Didn't I just read
they were facing liquidation?

09:25.560 --> 09:27.560
Hm. They weren't the only ones.

09:27.640 --> 09:29.200
[laughs]

09:29.280 --> 09:31.720
At least you haven't lost
your sense of humor.

09:31.800 --> 09:38.600
Lorna, you're once, twice,
three times a lady.

09:38.680 --> 09:41.320
And I've only ever said that
to six other people before.

09:42.160 --> 09:44.560
You sound like your character
from our show.

09:44.640 --> 09:46.400
I watched an episode of that
the other day.

09:46.480 --> 09:48.920
Really? [laughs] How did it look?

09:49.000 --> 09:50.080
Damn good.

09:50.360 --> 09:53.600
Look, Principal, I don't think
I can goddamn do this anymore.

09:53.680 --> 09:56.680
There's only so many times
I can watch you throw a flush

09:56.760 --> 09:58.480
while I end up with a deuce.

09:58.600 --> 10:00.760
I'm sure I don't know
what you mean, Professor.

10:00.840 --> 10:01.880
Christ to hell.

10:01.960 --> 10:05.880
I'm sick of being just another British
stud you figure you can take off the shelf

10:05.960 --> 10:08.080
whenever there's an itch
that needs a-scratchin'.

10:08.160 --> 10:11.520
-I'm sorry?
-Spare me the Girl Guide routine.

10:11.600 --> 10:14.120
You're just using me
to make your husband jealous.

10:14.200 --> 10:16.600
Keep going, Professor.
I love it when you're angry.

10:21.280 --> 10:22.760
[Toast] I'm goddamn serious.

10:22.840 --> 10:25.040
Don't treat me like
a major league son of a bitch!

10:25.120 --> 10:28.600
Go ahead, do it.
Would it make you feel more like a man?

10:28.680 --> 10:30.440
-[growls] Yes!
-[exhales] Get out!

10:30.520 --> 10:35.240
Oh, I'm leaving. But I'll be back in
the morning for my share of the business.

10:35.320 --> 10:36.960
And the baby!

10:39.640 --> 10:40.800
[sighs]

10:42.760 --> 10:44.680
Sometimes it's hard to let go of the past.

10:44.760 --> 10:47.600
-I'm off to see Francis Bacon.
-Isn't he dead?

10:47.680 --> 10:49.680
Why does everyone say that?

10:50.560 --> 10:53.640
-Honey, you can always stay here with me.
-[coughs]

10:53.720 --> 10:55.920
[thinks]
My God, she is fucking beautiful,

10:56.000 --> 11:01.160
but I know we can never get back together.
If I don't leave now, I'll never leave.

11:01.240 --> 11:02.680
I'd better say that out loud.

11:02.760 --> 11:05.480
If I don't leave now,
I'll never leave. Bye!

Not turning up to my opening with
George from ASDA on my arm. [chuckles]

11:26.640 --> 11:29.840
We'll go to Turnbull's
off St James's. My treat.

11:29.920 --> 11:33.600
Ah, and I've ordered us
a nice bottle of bubbly.

11:33.680 --> 11:36.720
Yes... Yes, I'm raising a glass now.

11:36.800 --> 11:38.920
To us! [chuckles]

11:39.000 --> 11:43.000
-[buzzer]
-Hmm. Come up, dear. It's open!

11:43.080 --> 11:45.040

-[door closes]

11:49.000 --> 11:51.400
Toast! How are you?

11:51.480 --> 11:53.720
I was just ordering
some printer ink cartridges.

11:53.800 --> 11:54.880
I'll call you back.

11:56.160 --> 11:57.960
You look very depressed, Toast.

11:58.040 --> 12:00.000
Where have you been? The Old Kent Road?

12:00.920 --> 12:03.920
I'm sorry, Bacon. I need somewhere
to stay for a day or two.

12:04.000 --> 12:06.720
Oh... Something happen between you and Ed?

12:06.800 --> 12:08.360
He's an odd fish, isn't he?

12:08.440 --> 12:10.200
I see you've been painting
your father again.

12:10.280 --> 12:13.640
Hm? Oh, yes. [laughs] Grr.

12:13.720 --> 12:16.920
I'm in a quandary. Lorna's back.

12:17.000 --> 12:18.440
The American with the dicky eye?

12:18.520 --> 12:20.160
Only when she does close-ups.

12:20.240 --> 12:22.800
I remember the mess
she made of you last time.

12:22.880 --> 12:25.560
Didn't you cry so hard
you shat yourself in your room?

12:25.640 --> 12:29.640
No, I shut myself in my room.
I shat myself in Oddbins.

12:29.720 --> 12:30.880
Oh, yes, that's right.

12:30.960 --> 12:33.000
Didn't I just read
they're facing liquidation?

12:34.200 --> 12:37.280
They weren't the only ones. [laughs]

12:37.360 --> 12:40.080
I'd stick to drama, Toast.

12:40.160 --> 12:43.880
But... You did love her, didn't you?

12:43.960 --> 12:46.360
I did. I still do.

12:46.440 --> 12:47.840
Oh.

12:49.240 --> 12:53.920
I don't mean to impose, Bacon, but...
I really don't have anywhere else to go.

Go to Lorna.

-[horse neighs]

15:14.640 --> 15:17.640
That was definitely the best sex
I've ever had without getting an erection.

15:17.720 --> 15:19.200
What's that all about?

15:19.280 --> 15:20.720
It's 'cause I'm so in love with you.

15:20.800 --> 15:24.160
I can only normally achieve an erection
with people I have zero respect for.

15:24.240 --> 15:25.240
[gasps]

15:27.640 --> 15:29.320
-[Lorna] There he is.
-[Toast] There he is.

15:29.400 --> 15:30.400
[camera clicks]

15:30.480 --> 15:33.840
Hey, I'm gonna go round to Ed's
and pick up the rest of my belongings,

15:33.920 --> 15:35.360
but I'll be straight back.

15:35.440 --> 15:38.320
Perfect. Oh, there's one thing though,
Toast, before you go.

15:38.400 --> 15:42.080
I'm not even sure if it's worth
mentioning, but, um... it may be relevant.

15:42.160 --> 15:44.720
-What is it?
-I'm married.

15:46.320 --> 15:47.680
-You're married?
-Yeah.

15:47.760 --> 15:50.000
Although, my husband
pays me so little attention,

15:50.080 --> 15:52.920
he may have actually
forgotten about it, so...

15:53.000 --> 15:54.280
You're married to someone else?

15:54.360 --> 15:57.120
I think you should meet him
and explain the situation.

15:57.200 --> 15:59.360
It would be so much better
coming from you.

15:59.440 --> 16:01.720
Tell him that my marriage to him is over.

16:01.800 --> 16:05.160
He's recording in London at the moment.
You could go to his studio.

16:05.240 --> 16:07.760
He's not one of those chaps
with his bare backside hanging out,

16:07.840 --> 16:09.720
carrying industrial tape and drugs, is he?

16:09.800 --> 16:11.360
No, he's not a fucking...

16:11.440 --> 16:14.720
He's not a roadie, Toast.
He's a rock musician.

16:14.800 --> 16:16.360
This could be our second chance.

16:16.440 --> 16:17.840
You know what? You're right.

16:19.280 --> 16:22.240
I don't care that you're married
to someone else. It's you I love,

16:22.320 --> 16:25.480
and after years of being dealt the deuce,

16:25.560 --> 16:28.240
I finally feel like I'm holding a flush.

16:34.200 --> 16:36.200
-[demonic laughter]
-Whoa.

16:37.400 --> 16:38.840
-Ed?
-[Ed] I'm down here!

16:38.920 --> 16:41.280
-Under the table!
-What the hell are you doing down there?

16:41.360 --> 16:42.880
Hiding from Honeysuckle.

16:42.960 --> 16:45.560
I just came to say goodbye, Ed.
I'm moving in with Lorna.

16:45.640 --> 16:46.800
Oh, don't leave me!

16:46.880 --> 16:51.560
I have to. I need to move on.
I know it's the right thing to do. I...

16:51.640 --> 16:54.400
-What's wrong, Toast?
-Nothing. No, I uh...

16:55.080 --> 16:56.640
[groans]

17:00.120 --> 17:02.320
[gasps] Oh, my God!

17:04.200 --> 17:06.000
[Toast] Come on. We don't have much time.

17:06.079 --> 17:07.880
Our flight to Hawaii leaves in an hour.

17:07.960 --> 17:09.240
[sobs]

17:09.319 --> 17:13.040
You said you hated your husband. That you
wanted him dead. And that you love me.

17:13.119 --> 17:14.319
[sobs]

17:14.400 --> 17:15.880
[Toast] You do love me, don't you?

17:17.119 --> 17:19.119
Don't tell me I've got this badly wrong.

17:19.200 --> 17:21.160
[sobs hysterically]

17:21.240 --> 17:22.839
I'll bring the car out front.

17:24.440 --> 17:25.920
See you in a minute.

17:27.560 --> 17:31.840
No-o-o-o! [sobs]

17:33.840 --> 17:36.520
[Ed] You're not having second thoughts
about you and Lorna, are you?

17:36.600 --> 17:38.760
Course I'm not.
What the hell's with all the knives?

17:38.840 --> 17:40.920
It's part of my father's collection.
Do you want one?

17:41.000 --> 17:42.800
Why not? Everyone else seems to have one.

17:42.880 --> 17:44.880
I hope that homeopath gets here soon!

17:44.960 --> 17:47.400
-[glass shatters]
-[evil laugh]

18:03.600 --> 18:05.760
-[loud music]
-[man] Hey! Stop, stop.

18:05.840 --> 18:07.360
Guys?

18:07.440 --> 18:11.640
It's too loud. Though something's
been on my mind for the last few days.

18:11.720 --> 18:13.760
What is it, Josh?

18:13.840 --> 18:16.320
I think we should scrap
these electric instruments

18:16.400 --> 18:18.840
and just play wooden ones.

18:19.760 --> 18:22.800
We're about to begin an arena tour.
How are they gonna hear us?

18:22.880 --> 18:26.680
I wanna cancel those venues
and just play churches.

18:26.760 --> 18:29.840
-What the fuck?
-You know, I'm getting just a little sick

18:29.920 --> 18:31.680
of the amount of bad language

18:31.760 --> 18:34.520
and the unprotected sex
that I see on these arena tours.

18:34.600 --> 18:36.040
-[laughs]
-[Josh] No, I'm serious.

18:36.120 --> 18:39.200
You think I'm kidding?
I dare you to test me.

18:39.720 --> 18:41.560
I will strangle you with the hands

18:41.640 --> 18:43.600
-that the good Lord gave me--
-[phone vibrates]

18:51.200 --> 18:52.520
What the hell is that?

18:56.160 --> 18:58.000
OK, Lorna. I'm gonna go in there,

18:58.080 --> 19:00.200
sort the rock man out, once and for all.

19:00.280 --> 19:03.160
-Then we can start our new life together.
-[gasps]

19:08.280 --> 19:09.320
Good luck.

19:09.400 --> 19:13.040
-[song finishes]
-Isn't that beautiful?

19:14.360 --> 19:16.840
Which one of you cocksuckers
is Lorna Wynde's husband?

19:17.800 --> 19:19.680
-That'd be me.
-Yeah?

19:19.760 --> 19:21.720
Well, she's in love with me
and she's leaving you

19:21.800 --> 19:23.240
and your marriage is over.

19:23.320 --> 19:26.080
So, you'd better deal with that like a man
and step aside.

19:26.160 --> 19:27.440
What did you just say?

19:28.240 --> 19:29.400
What, are you fucking deaf?

19:31.640 --> 19:34.560
Whoa! [yells]
Oh, shit his nose has come off!

19:34.640 --> 19:36.320
-Oh!
-[Toast] It's all right, I've got it.

19:36.400 --> 19:38.360
-[Josh groans]
-Oh, my God!

19:38.440 --> 19:41.240
-His beautiful nose!
-Yeah, no, it's fine.

19:41.320 --> 19:44.800
-He just walked into the blade.
-No, no, no!

19:44.880 --> 19:48.480
Lorna, we need to go. I arranged for us
to look at a flat at 5:30.

19:48.560 --> 19:49.960
Look what you've done!

19:50.040 --> 19:52.480
I didn't do anything!
Like I said, he walked into the blade!

19:52.560 --> 19:54.320
Oh, darling!

19:54.400 --> 19:58.360
I'm sorry I've been neglecting you.
I wanna renew our marriage vows

19:58.440 --> 19:59.800
and I wanna live a holy life.

19:59.880 --> 20:02.200
[Lorna] I'm sorry too, honey.

20:02.280 --> 20:05.120
I sent you those selfies of me and Toast
to make you jealous.

20:05.200 --> 20:09.480
Just so you pay me a little
more attention. It's you I love, not him.

20:09.560 --> 20:13.720
No way him. He's a fucking loser asshole!

20:14.560 --> 20:16.680
-Oh, my God!
-What a fool I've been.

20:16.760 --> 20:19.560
[thinks]  She's obviously still in love
with the rock man.

20:19.640 --> 20:22.960
All this to make him jealous.
Just like that two-bit soap we were in.

20:23.040 --> 20:26.600
I thought I'd been dealt a flush,
but I've ended up with another deuce.

20:26.680 --> 20:28.320
I'd better say that out loud.

20:28.400 --> 20:31.760
I thought I'd been dealt a flush,
but I've ended up with another deuce.

20:31.840 --> 20:33.600
Can somebody call an ambulance?

20:34.080 --> 20:35.280
Oh, God! [sobs]

20:36.320 --> 20:38.160
What shall I do about the flat?

20:39.920 --> 20:45.680
[groaning sounds]

20:45.760 --> 20:47.760
Ed, is that you? I'm coming in!

20:47.840 --> 20:50.200
Don't, Toast! Please don't come in!

20:50.280 --> 20:51.480
I'm coming in.

20:53.920 --> 20:56.000
What the hell are you two up to, Ed?

20:56.080 --> 20:59.080
[demonic voice] Hey, cocksucker.
Wanna see something cool?

20:59.160 --> 21:01.360
-What?
-[Honeysuckle growls]

21:01.440 --> 21:05.080
[thunder]

21:05.160 --> 21:06.280
Dear God!

21:06.360 --> 21:07.560
[growls]

21:07.640 --> 21:10.760
The good news is that Alan
the homeopath is on his way.

21:12.280 --> 21:14.720
-[man] Is the girl in there?
-Is that you, Alan?

21:14.800 --> 21:17.280
-[Alan] Of course it's me!
-[growls and snarls]

21:21.240 --> 21:22.760
[Toast] What are you gonna do, Alan?

21:23.960 --> 21:25.240
What am I gonna do?

21:25.840 --> 21:29.840
I'm a fucking homeopath, aren't I?
I'm gonna do it the natural way.

21:30.960 --> 21:33.000
[growls]

21:35.800 --> 21:39.120
Fu-u-uck off!

21:42.440 --> 21:44.000
That should do it.

21:44.080 --> 21:46.200
Well, I must say, I'm very impressed.

21:46.680 --> 21:48.920
[Ed] This homeopathy lark
seems to have done the trick.

21:49.560 --> 21:52.320
I don't know much about it,
but there's clearly a marked improvement.

21:52.800 --> 21:56.840
You see, a lot of people,
they look down their nose at homeopathy.

21:56.920 --> 21:58.280
They think it's a scam.

21:59.360 --> 22:02.240
But that's because they don't know
what the fuck they're talking about.

22:03.520 --> 22:07.600
Well, it's clearly very effective,
and not the complete bullshit I'd assumed.

22:08.440 --> 22:11.000
Ah, so, everything back to normal.

22:11.840 --> 22:15.440
So, Toast, how did the confrontation
with Lorna's husband go?

22:15.520 --> 22:21.280
[sighs] Turns out Lorna was using me
just to make her husband jealous.

22:21.360 --> 22:24.320
She's still very much in love
with the rock man.

22:24.400 --> 22:25.840
We won't be moving in together.

22:25.920 --> 22:27.920
Ah, shame.

22:28.880 --> 22:32.680
Then there was an altercation
and his nose got cut off.

22:34.800 --> 22:36.320
Are you all right, son?

22:37.400 --> 22:39.920
He'll be fine. As I said...

22:40.000 --> 22:42.000
