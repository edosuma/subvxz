WEBVTT

00:01.919 --> 00:03.218
(sighs)
Look, I can't believe this, man.

00:03.254 --> 00:05.387
Who would've ever thought
my wife

00:05.423 --> 00:07.823
would have an affair
with my barber?

00:10.828 --> 00:12.628
I mean, come on, man,
not my mailman,

00:12.663 --> 00:17.132
not my garbageman,
but my hair confidant.

00:17.168 --> 00:20.335
Look, this is what happened--
like six weeks ago, right,

00:20.371 --> 00:22.171
I was sitting in a chair
getting my hair cut,

00:22.206 --> 00:25.641
and she walked in and-and
they made this eye contact.

00:25.676 --> 00:27.443
And I can't really describe it,
you know,

00:27.478 --> 00:29.244
but, you know, I tried to turn
my head to see it,

00:29.280 --> 00:32.047
but he was holding it,
he's pretty strong.

00:33.884 --> 00:36.018
So, look, I confronted her,
right?

00:37.388 --> 00:39.988
And I was right.

00:40.024 --> 00:42.591
They're not together,
but we split.

00:42.626 --> 00:44.093
Yeah, she took the kids
to Cleveland

00:44.128 --> 00:46.829
to stay by some family.

00:46.864 --> 00:50.499
(sighs) Now, look, I could fight
for custody, you know.

00:50.534 --> 00:52.034
But that's such
a difficult thing to do.

00:52.069 --> 00:53.802
I've seen friends do it,

00:53.838 --> 00:56.672
and they treated their kids
like furniture.

00:56.707 --> 00:58.874
Which she also took, by the way.

01:00.845 --> 01:02.845
(sighs)

01:02.880 --> 01:04.880
Man, I won't lie, man,
it's just,

01:04.915 --> 01:06.348
it's hard coming home
to an empty house

01:06.383 --> 01:08.050
with nobody to greet you,
you know.

01:08.085 --> 01:10.319
And now my Wi-Fi not working.

01:11.989 --> 01:14.490
Which is why I called
your customer service number.

01:20.564 --> 01:22.865
You know, ever since the
separation, man, you know,

01:22.900 --> 01:25.033
me and the kids FaceTime
every day.

01:25.069 --> 01:26.802
(sighs)
You know what's crazy?

01:26.837 --> 01:29.138
Nowadays, there's no reason
to be a deadbeat dad.

01:29.173 --> 01:30.672
If you don't want
to see your kids now,

01:30.708 --> 01:33.075
you just don't want to see
your damn kids.

01:33.110 --> 01:34.843
Okay, hold on.

01:34.879 --> 01:36.879
Got you, brother.

01:36.914 --> 01:38.914
That back in there.

01:40.217 --> 01:42.217
Oh-ho-ho.

01:45.523 --> 01:47.656
That worked.
(chuckles)

01:47.691 --> 01:50.092
And, yes, I will take
your customer service

01:50.127 --> 01:52.361
satisfaction survey.

02:03.107 --> 02:04.873
(chuckles)
Getting all big and stuff.

02:04.909 --> 02:07.776
Look, I know it's only been six
days, but you look big to me.

02:07.812 --> 02:10.379
-(knock on door)
-It's open.

02:10.414 --> 02:12.014
Now, look, I've been up
all night and all day

02:12.049 --> 02:13.215
building furniture for you guys

02:13.250 --> 02:14.917
when you come visit here
next time.

02:14.952 --> 02:16.718
I mean, it's so much furniture
put together--

02:16.754 --> 02:18.787
tables, chairs, everything.
(laughs)

02:18.823 --> 02:21.757
Oh, oh, your godmother's here.
Say-say hi to the kids.

02:21.792 --> 02:25.194
-Hey, babies.
Furniture looks great.
-(laughing)

02:25.229 --> 02:27.796
Told you.

02:27.832 --> 02:30.199
Look, here, man, I love y'all

02:30.234 --> 02:31.767
and I will talk
to y'all later, okay?

02:31.802 --> 02:33.936
A'ight. Bye.

02:33.971 --> 02:35.537
-(chuckles)
-Bro.

02:35.573 --> 02:39.374
Now, I was expecting
this to be sad, but damn.

02:39.410 --> 02:42.744
This looks like a place
where they bag heroin.

02:42.780 --> 02:44.446
(sighs)

02:44.481 --> 02:46.248
Brittany, you're supposed
to be my best friend, okay?

02:46.283 --> 02:47.816
-Cut me some slack, all right?
-(scoffs)

02:47.852 --> 02:50.152
Why don't you show me
some love and compassion?

02:50.187 --> 02:52.154
Listen, people who love you
got to tell you the truth.

02:52.189 --> 02:55.524
And the truth is,
it smells in here.

02:56.594 --> 02:58.227
No, it don't smell in here.

02:58.262 --> 03:01.396
It's just the Oodles of Noodles.

03:01.432 --> 03:04.433
Rel, it is 9:00 in the morning.
Give the day a chance.

03:07.371 --> 03:09.338
I am. That's why I started
with Oodles of Noodles.

03:09.373 --> 03:10.906
I feel great.

03:10.941 --> 03:13.008
You can't possibly feel great.

03:13.043 --> 03:14.776
You're the most sensitive
person I know.

03:14.812 --> 03:17.079
You cried at the end
of<i> Back to the Future.</i>

03:17.114 --> 03:20.682
Look, I thought Doc Brown
was dead, okay?

03:20.718 --> 03:22.985
And look, look, I know things
look rough right now,

03:23.020 --> 03:24.853
but, you know, shibbity dobos,

03:24.889 --> 03:27.589
I mean, my future looking
bright, you know what I mean?

03:27.625 --> 03:29.258
Look, I'm-a go to church, right?

03:29.293 --> 03:30.759
I'm-a come back here,
I'm-a build this furniture up

03:30.794 --> 03:32.427
and, you know, maybe
I'll start dating again.

03:32.463 --> 03:33.829
You know, get me
a new soul mate.

03:33.864 --> 03:37.032
A new soul mate?

03:37.067 --> 03:40.202
That's a Disney Princess-ass
goal.

03:41.639 --> 03:43.372
Just slow it down.
Take it in.

03:43.407 --> 03:44.973
Just slow it down. Slow it down.

03:45.009 --> 03:47.209
No, no, no, I'm not slowing
nothing down, okay?

03:47.244 --> 03:49.111
Let me tell you a story.

03:49.146 --> 03:51.380
For the first 30 years of my
life, I would not eat pastrami

03:51.415 --> 03:52.981
'cause the name "pastrami"
gave me the creeps.

03:53.017 --> 03:56.451
Yes, but then one day
I tried it by accident

03:56.487 --> 03:58.053
and I end up loving it.

03:58.088 --> 03:59.721
(sighs)
And I could never get back

03:59.757 --> 04:02.190
those 30 pastrami-less years.

04:02.226 --> 04:05.027
Look, if pastrami has taught me
one thing, okay,

04:05.062 --> 04:06.728
it's to get out there and try.

04:06.764 --> 04:10.465
Okay, you know pastrami
is not a philosopher, right?

04:10.501 --> 04:12.901
It's just meat.

04:12.937 --> 04:15.837
Look, okay, if you really feel
like you're ready

04:15.873 --> 04:19.207
to get back out there again,
I mean, I could probably

04:19.243 --> 04:20.976
hook you up with my girl Monica.

04:21.011 --> 04:24.212
Yeah, I'm-a give you that,
you know. (laughs)

04:24.248 --> 04:26.248
-Your girl Monica? (chuckles)
-Yeah.

04:26.283 --> 04:29.284
No, I'm good.

04:35.526 --> 04:37.292
What's wrong with Monica?

04:38.362 --> 04:40.362
Monica...

04:42.299 --> 04:45.367
I mean, she wears loose boots.

04:45.402 --> 04:46.902
Loose boots?

04:46.937 --> 04:48.670
Yes, yes, loose boots.

04:48.706 --> 04:52.207
Her boot is too wide for her
little-ass ankle. It just...

04:52.242 --> 04:55.043
Feet be sliding back and forth
in the boot.

04:55.079 --> 04:58.513
Stuff be falling all in it
and everything.

04:58.549 --> 05:00.615
And, look, as a nurse,
I really think it's unsafe

05:00.651 --> 05:02.851
for her to wear that boot.

05:02.886 --> 05:06.688
Are you saying you won't date
an awesome woman

05:06.724 --> 05:10.625
because
of her boot circumference?

05:10.661 --> 05:12.627
Yes, that's exactly
what I'm saying.

05:12.663 --> 05:14.262
Oh, my God.

05:14.298 --> 05:16.198
Yo, big bro.

05:16.233 --> 05:18.133
Nat, your brother's insane.

05:18.168 --> 05:20.302
He refuses to go out
with my girl Monica.

05:20.337 --> 05:22.437
Wait, Loose Boots Monica?

05:26.143 --> 05:28.377
Hell no.

05:28.412 --> 05:30.379
(laughs)

05:30.414 --> 05:32.414
Listen, I ain't gonna let
my friend be judged

05:32.449 --> 05:35.417
by a guy who just got
out of jail for selling crack.

05:35.452 --> 05:38.420
I'm tired of people calling me
a crack dealer.

05:38.455 --> 05:40.555
It was Ecstasy.

05:40.591 --> 05:43.558
I'm a changed man.
Look, I stopped selling.

05:43.594 --> 05:45.293
I even joined Oprah's Book Club.

05:48.165 --> 05:50.098
A'ight, let me
holla at you, okay?

05:50.134 --> 05:51.233
When we get to the church,

05:51.268 --> 05:52.734
you cannot tell Dad
about the barber.

05:52.770 --> 05:54.269
I'm your little brother, man.

05:54.304 --> 05:55.971
Why would I tell Dad anything?

05:56.006 --> 05:57.272
Look at me.

05:57.307 --> 05:59.374
You know I got you.

06:02.212 --> 06:04.946
Rel, you know I said I got you?
I don't got you.

06:04.982 --> 06:06.081
I told Dad yesterday.

06:06.116 --> 06:10.185
Your wife and your barber?

06:12.790 --> 06:15.190
-Look, Dad...
-Oh, don't "Look, Dad" me.

06:15.225 --> 06:17.459
All that money I spent on you
for glasses as a child,

06:17.494 --> 06:19.094
you didn't see this coming?

06:19.129 --> 06:20.495
You might as well be blind, Rel.

06:20.531 --> 06:22.164
Hey, hey, hey, shh, shh.
Keep it down, Dad.

06:22.199 --> 06:23.465
I don't want everybody
in my business like that.

06:23.500 --> 06:25.000
You think I want
everybody to know?

06:25.035 --> 06:26.435
You think I'm gonna
go out and tell the world

06:26.470 --> 06:28.403
that I raised a son
with no ding-a-ling?

06:30.174 --> 06:32.174
It's a dark, dark day, Rel.

06:32.209 --> 06:33.842
You should be feeling
all kinds of stuff:

06:33.877 --> 06:37.145
pain that-that your family is
gone and your life is ruined,

06:37.181 --> 06:40.382
anger at your barber
and your shortcoming as a man--

06:40.417 --> 06:42.517
now, go on,
this ain't about you--

06:42.553 --> 06:44.386
and most of all, shame--

06:44.421 --> 06:46.621
deep, dark, horrible shame, man.

06:46.657 --> 06:47.989
This is worse than the day
I found out

06:48.025 --> 06:49.191
that Nat was a crack dealer.

06:49.226 --> 06:51.827
-It was Ecstasy...
-Same thing!

06:55.232 --> 06:57.399
Look, hey, I'm sorry, Nat.
I'm sorry.

06:57.434 --> 06:59.201
I'm sor-- that was cold.
I'm sorry.

06:59.236 --> 07:02.270
All right? Ecstasy is different.

07:03.907 --> 07:06.074
Rel, look, you gave me
two beautiful grandchildren,

07:06.110 --> 07:07.509
so, look, man, obviously,

07:07.544 --> 07:08.543
you're working
with something down there.

07:08.579 --> 07:09.978
You know, I'm just...

07:10.013 --> 07:12.848
Look, ever since
your mother passed away,

07:12.883 --> 07:14.850
I just, I just have
a lot of anger in me, man.

07:14.885 --> 07:17.252
I just, I just took it out
on you guys and I'm sorry.

07:17.287 --> 07:20.222
Look, I don't care if you deal
crack to everybody in Chicago

07:20.257 --> 07:21.890
and your wives
sleep with everybody.

07:21.925 --> 07:25.227
I want you to know I love you.
You know that, right?

07:25.262 --> 07:26.661
Yeah, we know.

07:26.697 --> 07:28.096
-We love you, too, Dad.
-All right.

07:28.132 --> 07:29.865
And love, love is understanding.

07:29.900 --> 07:31.533
That's why I want you
to understand why I got to sit

07:31.568 --> 07:33.935
far, far away from y'all today.

07:33.971 --> 07:36.438
I got friends in there.
I can't walk in there like this.

07:37.875 --> 07:39.674
See you inside.

07:39.710 --> 07:42.043
Uh-uh, don't follow me.
Give me five seconds.

07:43.480 --> 07:45.447
(organ music playing)

07:45.482 --> 07:48.283
Understand that God has a
blueprint for all of our lives,

07:48.318 --> 07:51.019
but the end of the day, to only
make that blueprint happen,

07:51.054 --> 07:52.754
you got to have faith.

07:52.789 --> 07:55.690
Man, you got to have faith.

07:55.726 --> 07:57.959
(sighs)
Now, listen, look, look.

07:57.995 --> 07:59.961
You may be embarrassed, right?

07:59.997 --> 08:03.198
And-and your life may be
in shambles, right?

08:03.233 --> 08:06.034
And-and you, you may feel alone

08:06.069 --> 08:08.770
because your-your wife
left you and took the kids,

08:08.805 --> 08:11.072
and now you're sitting there
eating Oodles of Noodles

08:11.108 --> 08:12.941
all by yourself.

08:12.976 --> 08:15.744
And all that sodium
is in your body.

08:18.282 --> 08:20.248
-He's not talking
about me, right?
-Oh, no. No.

08:20.284 --> 08:22.284
And your brother out here
telling everybody

08:22.319 --> 08:24.286
all your business.

08:24.321 --> 08:27.756
The man just got out of jail.
Probably a snitch.

08:30.260 --> 08:32.994
And your daddy,
he is not even talking to you.

08:33.030 --> 08:34.896
He's not talking
because he's embarrassed.

08:34.932 --> 08:36.298
He don't even want
to sit near you.

08:36.333 --> 08:38.133
He don't even want
to see your face.

08:38.168 --> 08:40.135
That hurts!

08:40.170 --> 08:42.270
All I'm saying is...

08:42.306 --> 08:45.307
Brother Rel, look here, man.
We're praying for you, brother.

08:45.342 --> 08:48.143
We know what you got going on.
Look, everything I just said.

08:48.178 --> 08:49.311
I know y'all was trying
to figure out

08:49.346 --> 08:50.512
who I was talking about.

08:50.547 --> 08:52.447
It's Brother Rel. It's him.

08:52.482 --> 08:54.015
It's all his life.

08:54.051 --> 08:55.817
But we love you anyway.

08:55.852 --> 08:57.419
And that's why
we gonna envelop him.

08:57.454 --> 08:58.820
Everybody stand up,
put your hands towards him.

08:58.855 --> 09:00.855
Right now.

09:00.891 --> 09:03.858
Envelop him.
Man, envelop him right now.

09:03.894 --> 09:05.627
(indistinct chatter)

09:09.166 --> 09:11.700
-Rel....
-Ah.

09:18.709 --> 09:21.009
Hey, guys, you have to pay.

09:21.044 --> 09:22.677
Ain't nobody paying
until the swelling

09:22.713 --> 09:25.313
in your hand go down,
Carl Winslow.

09:25.349 --> 09:26.815
Fat hand-having ass.

09:26.850 --> 09:29.150
Jimmy Dean sausage
hand-having ass.

09:29.186 --> 09:30.552
Breakfast hand-having ass.

09:30.587 --> 09:32.153
What the hell wrong with you?

09:32.189 --> 09:34.956
I'm just playing with this fool.
Give me some.

09:34.992 --> 09:36.658
The truth. I'm the truth.

09:36.693 --> 09:39.394
Who done left
their grown-ass baby on the bus?

09:39.429 --> 09:40.962
(laughter)

09:40.998 --> 09:42.564
Ex-Excuse me?
Look-look, I don't know

09:42.599 --> 09:44.366
if you know me,
but I'm a tax-paying citizen.

09:44.401 --> 09:46.067
Man, nobody want
to hear all that.

09:46.103 --> 09:47.969
You gonna get your Martin
Luther King "I Had a Dream"

09:48.005 --> 09:51.139
suit-wearing ass--
boy, your casket show up.

09:51.174 --> 09:54.409
You're dead. Okay, boy?
Who at your funeral? Nobody.

09:54.444 --> 09:57.312
-Stupid-ass boy...
-Hey, hey, chill, chill. Okay?

09:57.347 --> 09:59.014
My brother's going through
a tough time right now.

09:59.049 --> 10:01.316
Relax.

10:01.351 --> 10:05.420
Hmm. You do look
kind of familiar, man.

10:05.455 --> 10:06.721
I can't believe
we've been up here

10:06.757 --> 10:09.024
grilling you this whole time.

10:09.059 --> 10:13.094
Ain't you the guy whose wife
slept with his barber?

10:16.033 --> 10:19.401
(laughter)

10:19.436 --> 10:22.370
Oh! Lord have mercy...

10:24.274 --> 10:26.875
You ain't gonna never gonna get
your hair cut again, man.

10:26.910 --> 10:29.411
It's looking rough for you, boy.
It's looking rough.

10:29.446 --> 10:31.346
Look, hey. All right?

10:31.381 --> 10:32.781
There's nothing wrong
with the way I look, okay?

10:32.816 --> 10:35.350
And... right now
I'm in between barbers.

10:35.385 --> 10:36.685
(laughter)

10:36.720 --> 10:38.753
Your wife is, too.

10:38.789 --> 10:40.488
(laughs)

10:43.226 --> 10:45.393
What are you doing?

10:45.429 --> 10:48.263
I'm sorry, man,
he funny as hell. (laughs)

10:48.298 --> 10:50.932
Hey, hey. Look at his shoes.

10:57.240 --> 10:59.207
Look, I got to turn
this thing around, okay?

10:59.242 --> 11:01.576
This is how people's reputations
get destroyed.

11:01.611 --> 11:03.511
I refuse to end up
like Roach Girl.

11:03.547 --> 11:06.881
Relax. You are not gonna
end up like Roach Girl.

11:06.917 --> 11:08.483
Wait, who's Roach Girl?

11:08.518 --> 11:10.485
-You want me to... okay.
-Yeah, you got this.

11:10.520 --> 11:12.020
So, Roach Girl is this girl

11:12.055 --> 11:13.655
me and Brittany went
to school with. Okay?

11:13.690 --> 11:15.924
One day a roach crawled
out her book bag, right?

11:15.959 --> 11:18.093
Now, look, ain't nobody
judging her,

11:18.128 --> 11:20.995
'cause we all had roaches.

11:21.031 --> 11:22.764
But our roaches knew better
than to come out our book bags.

11:22.799 --> 11:24.032
(laughs)

11:25.969 --> 11:27.602
But the crazy thing is,
too, like,

11:27.637 --> 11:29.371
she's a successful
civil rights attorney, right?

11:29.406 --> 11:32.440
But the neighborhood still
call her Roach Girl.

11:32.476 --> 11:34.075
And look, I seen her last month.

11:34.111 --> 11:35.844
She tried to give me
one of those business cards.

11:35.879 --> 11:39.280
She reached in her purse,
and I was like, "Oh, nah."

11:40.951 --> 11:43.551
"I don't want that roach card."

11:43.587 --> 11:45.787
And she understood.

11:45.822 --> 11:47.856
This is what you should do:

11:47.891 --> 11:49.924
hook up with someone
the barber's seeing.

11:49.960 --> 11:52.260
That way, everyone will know
about it, and then boom.

11:52.295 --> 11:53.962
Got your reputation back.

11:53.997 --> 11:55.964
Well, you blew your chance
at that, mister,

11:55.999 --> 11:58.032
because you know
who the barber really likes

11:58.068 --> 11:59.467
and has been pursuing
for months?

11:59.503 --> 12:01.970
My girl Loose Boots Monica.

12:02.005 --> 12:04.639
-(laughs)
-What? Loose--
don't call her that.

12:04.674 --> 12:07.475
Should be just Monica,
'cause she's a sweetheart.

12:09.913 --> 12:11.246
Talking about her boots
like that.

12:11.281 --> 12:12.881
No, you should hook us up.

12:12.916 --> 12:14.315
You know, the whole
loose boot thing I was talking

12:14.351 --> 12:16.151
about earlier,
I was just joking. (laughs)

12:16.186 --> 12:18.153
No, you wasn't. You told me
people with loose boots are full

12:18.188 --> 12:21.489
of disease and shouldn't be
allowed in restaurants.

12:21.525 --> 12:23.925
(scoffs)

12:25.529 --> 12:27.429
Look-look, Brittany, look,
I can bring Monica here, right?

12:27.464 --> 12:29.063
They got a steppers' night here.

12:29.099 --> 12:30.899
I'll have her here,
we'll have a great time.

12:30.934 --> 12:33.001
I'm telling you,
I wouldn't even be using her.

12:33.036 --> 12:34.035
Of course you are.

12:35.338 --> 12:37.071
But that's what
human interaction is, Rel.

12:37.107 --> 12:38.506
You know what I'm saying?
Everybody uses everybody.

12:38.542 --> 12:40.475
That's how we get by.
Check this out.

12:40.510 --> 12:43.311
A child uses a mother
for food and shelter, right?

12:43.346 --> 12:45.580
And the mother uses the child
for love and fulfillment.

12:45.615 --> 12:47.482
Now, we use people
so people feel of use.

12:47.517 --> 12:48.950
You see what I'm saying?

12:51.688 --> 12:53.922
Man, they need to have you start
speaking at college graduations

12:53.957 --> 12:55.123
-or something, man.
-(laughs)

12:55.158 --> 12:57.125
Straight up.
(laughs)

12:57.160 --> 12:59.761
Man, I am so proud of you.

12:59.796 --> 13:03.064
You went to jail kind of slow,
but you came out really wise.

13:05.869 --> 13:08.703
I guess the system does work,
man, look at you.

13:08.738 --> 13:10.939
Now, look, now, you heard that.

13:10.974 --> 13:13.775
Using people could be
used for good, you know?

13:13.810 --> 13:15.977
So how about it?
Hook your boy up.

13:16.012 --> 13:18.980
(sighs)
No.

13:21.184 --> 13:22.784
-Nat.
-Hey. Jaymo.

13:22.819 --> 13:24.352
-What up, boy?
-(laughs) Boy.

13:24.387 --> 13:25.954
Wait a minute, hey,
man, you invited him?

13:25.989 --> 13:28.156
-Yeah, he cool as hell.
-Hey, man,

13:28.191 --> 13:30.058
I'm sorry
about what happened earlier.

13:30.093 --> 13:31.693
I just ran into Roach Girl,

13:31.728 --> 13:34.229
and she said your wife
took your kids, too? Damn.

13:37.334 --> 13:39.901
So you just all alone?
Nobody to talk to?

13:39.936 --> 13:42.871
Nobody to come save you
if you start choking?

13:45.175 --> 13:46.674
You know, if I was you,
I would've killed myself

13:46.710 --> 13:48.276
three days ago.

13:50.380 --> 13:53.047
Anyhoo, I need a drink.

13:59.222 --> 14:03.024
(crying):
You heard that man. Please.

14:03.059 --> 14:05.059
(music playing)

14:14.471 --> 14:16.070
(music stops)

14:16.106 --> 14:17.705
(whoops)

14:17.741 --> 14:19.340
I am having so much fun.

14:19.376 --> 14:21.609
You are a really good stepper.

14:21.645 --> 14:25.413
-You damn right I am.
-(both laugh)

14:25.448 --> 14:27.715
Rel, I love those Jordans.

14:27.751 --> 14:30.051
Oh, thanks, uh,
well, I like your, um...

14:31.988 --> 14:33.421
(music playing)

14:35.625 --> 14:38.893
(chuckles)
I like your glasses.

14:38.929 --> 14:42.263
-Oh!
-You are truly a blind dime.

14:42.299 --> 14:44.065
A blind dime?

14:44.100 --> 14:45.800
You don't know
what a blind dime is?

14:45.835 --> 14:50.605
Come here. A blind dime is
a beautiful woman with glasses.

14:50.640 --> 14:54.709
Oh. Well,
you a blind dime yourself.

14:54.744 --> 14:56.311
Girl, you better
stop playing with me.

14:56.346 --> 14:58.313
-(both laugh)
-Calling me cute and stuff.

14:58.348 --> 14:59.981
-Go to that dance floor.
-Oh.

15:00.016 --> 15:01.416
Your fine self. Look at you.

15:01.451 --> 15:02.750
(laughs)

15:05.155 --> 15:06.254
What you want to drink?

15:06.289 --> 15:07.255
You know who that is, right?

15:07.290 --> 15:08.256
That's Frank the barber's girl.

15:08.291 --> 15:10.158
She's with me and she likes me.

15:10.193 --> 15:11.159
Tell everybody.

15:11.194 --> 15:12.794
Okay.

15:12.829 --> 15:15.330
But what you want to drink?

15:15.365 --> 15:16.598
Check you later.

15:17.834 --> 15:20.435
-Hey, you.
-(laughs): Ah...

15:20.470 --> 15:22.637
Hey, y'all know
who that is, right?

15:22.672 --> 15:24.906
That's Frank the barber girl,
and she's with me.

15:24.941 --> 15:26.140
Tell your family.

15:30.480 --> 15:31.846
Is that Frank the barber's girl?

15:31.881 --> 15:33.081
You damn straight it is.

15:33.116 --> 15:35.016
Ooh, you wild as hell, Rel.

15:35.051 --> 15:37.485
And you know it. Ah, ah, ah.

15:37.520 --> 15:40.254
(laughs)

15:40.290 --> 15:43.091
Did he just say you're here
with Frank the barber's girl?

15:43.126 --> 15:45.627
No, I didn't hear anything
like that. (chuckles)

15:45.662 --> 15:48.129
All right, we got a shout-out
for my man, Rel.

15:48.164 --> 15:49.964
He's with Frank
the barber's girl.

15:50.000 --> 15:53.201
-(crowd cheering)
-I see you, playboy.

15:53.236 --> 15:55.303
And to celebrate
the momentous occasion,

15:55.338 --> 15:57.839
a special love mix
for the new couple.

15:57.874 --> 16:02.343
-(romantic music plays)
-Rel, come here.

16:02.379 --> 16:03.978
I am not Frank
the barber's girl.

16:04.014 --> 16:06.714
We just went out a couple
of times. Why do you care?

16:06.750 --> 16:09.283
Okay, funny story, right?

16:09.319 --> 16:11.152
So Frank had sex with my wife,
right, so...

16:11.187 --> 16:13.488
Mm, you just trying
to have revenge sex with me

16:13.523 --> 16:15.189
to get back at your barber?

16:15.225 --> 16:17.692
Okay, you figured
that out quick.

16:18.928 --> 16:20.795
Look, it-it doesn't have to be
revenge sex, right?

16:20.830 --> 16:21.963
It could be, um,

16:21.998 --> 16:26.501
"two people with glasses
who like each other" sex.

16:26.536 --> 16:29.370
You think that I'm just
gonna let you use me?

16:29.406 --> 16:31.906
First of all,
I am a strong, independent,

16:31.941 --> 16:34.475
successful black woman,
and I'm not gonna let any man--

16:34.511 --> 16:36.911
I don't care who you are--
disrespect me.

16:39.683 --> 16:41.049
And I'm gonna tell you this:

16:41.084 --> 16:44.352
if you ever disrespect me again,
I'm gonna call my cousin

16:44.387 --> 16:46.454
and have him shoot up
your daddy's house.

16:50.694 --> 16:53.094
All right, we got another
shout-out to my man, Rel.

16:53.129 --> 16:55.430
He just blew it
with Frank the barber's girl.

16:55.465 --> 16:57.498
But it's all good, y'all,

16:57.534 --> 17:00.068
'cause we got drink specials.
Come on, let's party.

17:00.103 --> 17:01.536
(cheering)

17:06.976 --> 17:10.678
You told a DJ to shout out

17:10.714 --> 17:12.847
that you were with
Frank the barber's girl?

17:12.882 --> 17:14.215
And then asked her

17:14.250 --> 17:16.751
to have some weird
glasses revenge sex,

17:16.786 --> 17:18.619
-or whatever the hell that is.
-B-But...

17:20.056 --> 17:22.623
Okay, I didn't say anything
about her boots,

17:22.659 --> 17:24.859
and believe me,
they was loose as hell.

17:24.894 --> 17:27.962
Rel, listen, everyone
knows about the barber,

17:27.997 --> 17:31.299
and whatever respect you
had left is gone. You know why?

17:31.334 --> 17:33.701
Because you chose to handle this
like a child.

17:33.737 --> 17:35.603
You're right, all right? I...

17:35.638 --> 17:37.772
Yo, if I'm gonna clear my name
in the streets,

17:37.807 --> 17:39.907
I'm gonna have to deal
with Frank directly.

17:39.943 --> 17:41.876
That's what I'm talking about,
big bro.

17:41.911 --> 17:43.177
Prison yard rules.

17:44.848 --> 17:47.548
Somebody disrespect you,
walk up to 'em,

17:47.584 --> 17:48.883
stare at 'em just like this,

17:48.918 --> 17:51.886
put your hand on their shoulder,
and shank 'em.

17:51.921 --> 17:53.154
What?

17:53.189 --> 17:57.925
Boy, get your ass over here.

17:57.961 --> 18:01.329
You can't just go around
shanking people in regular life.

18:02.332 --> 18:03.731
It ain't even about that.

18:03.767 --> 18:05.967
Look, the way we were raised,
you're not gonna let another man

18:06.002 --> 18:08.503
disrespect you
and not say nothing.

18:08.538 --> 18:11.105
And he did the ultimate
disrespect, bro. (scoffs)

18:13.777 --> 18:15.777
You know something--
somewhere I got to be.

18:15.812 --> 18:19.347
Bro, you don't have anything
to prove to anybody.

18:22.652 --> 18:24.185
You do realize that you just

18:24.220 --> 18:25.987
might've got your brother
killed, right?

18:26.022 --> 18:29.857
Yeah, that's-that's just
starting to set in now.

18:39.135 --> 18:40.968
Hey, yo, Frank.

18:41.004 --> 18:42.670
Oh, what up, Rel?

18:42.705 --> 18:44.672
I was wondering when you was
coming back to get a cut.

18:44.707 --> 18:46.774
I didn't come here
to get no cut.

18:46.810 --> 18:48.810
I came here to kick your ass.

18:50.814 --> 18:52.446
Why?

18:52.482 --> 18:54.482
What you mean why?
You slept with my wife.

18:54.517 --> 18:58.519
Damn. So you know about that.

18:58.555 --> 18:59.987
Man, everybody knows about it.

19:00.023 --> 19:01.455
Hey, bro, that was
my wife, okay?

19:01.491 --> 19:03.291
I lost my family,
and it's all your fault.

19:03.326 --> 19:05.793
Come on, man. So now you're
saying it was all my fault?

19:05.829 --> 19:07.795
Yes, it was all of your fault.

19:07.831 --> 19:09.363
So you putting this all on me?

19:09.399 --> 19:12.400
Brother, are you deaf?

19:12.435 --> 19:14.335
Okay, yes.
Who else would I put it on?

19:14.370 --> 19:15.536
You.

19:15.572 --> 19:17.572
Me?

19:17.607 --> 19:21.309
Look, Rel, you trying to tell me
that you was this great husband?

19:21.344 --> 19:23.477
Shannon said that you
never even listened to her.

19:23.513 --> 19:26.147
-You never even asked her
about her dreams...
-Okay, loo-loo-loo-look.

19:26.182 --> 19:28.683
You don't know
nothing about us, okay?

19:28.718 --> 19:30.985
-Okay, you don't know nothing
about our marriage.
-Oh, I don't?

19:31.020 --> 19:33.187
One time, you missed
her birthday dinner

19:33.223 --> 19:37.425
because you got arrested
for a fight with a Uber driver

19:37.460 --> 19:39.760
'cause he wouldn't
let you play your music.

19:39.796 --> 19:41.762
Okay, then why'd he have
an auxiliary cord,

19:41.798 --> 19:45.600
you know what I mean?

19:45.635 --> 19:50.438
Look, man, I know your wife
physically just left,

19:50.473 --> 19:52.840
but emotionally
she'd been gone for years.

19:52.876 --> 19:54.542
Okay, look, bruh, I know
what you're doing, okay?

19:54.577 --> 19:56.110
Okay, you trying
to flip the script on me,

19:56.145 --> 19:57.945
but you don't know
anything, okay?

19:57.981 --> 19:59.947
We fell in love. We had kids.

19:59.983 --> 20:02.583
We got a house together.
We were good.

20:02.619 --> 20:05.286
Come on, man. She said
she couldn't even remember

20:05.321 --> 20:07.121
the last time
you two laughed together.

20:07.156 --> 20:11.192
She said the bond
that you used to have was gone.

20:11.227 --> 20:13.527
How could you have not seen?

20:13.563 --> 20:15.263
Maybe I did! Okay?

20:19.002 --> 20:21.002
Maybe I didn't want
to believe it was over.

20:23.806 --> 20:26.607
Look, man, I know I wasn't...

20:26.643 --> 20:29.477
wasn't a perfect husband...

20:29.512 --> 20:31.946
and I wasn't always there
when she needed me to be.

20:34.584 --> 20:37.184
Just thought she'd always be
there no matter what.

20:39.956 --> 20:43.758
But I took advantage
of that and...

20:43.793 --> 20:47.261
(sighs) honestly,
I got what I deserve.

20:51.834 --> 20:55.369
You know, I've slept
with a lot of guys' wives.

20:59.108 --> 21:02.076
But you, brother,

21:02.111 --> 21:04.111
you are, by far,
the most mature about it.

21:08.885 --> 21:12.687
You know that's no consolation
at all, Frank, right?

21:15.191 --> 21:18.025
Rel, I'm proud of you, son.
I love you.

21:18.061 --> 21:19.994
You know, when your mother
first passed away,

21:20.029 --> 21:21.529
I was kind of lonely
in that house by myself,

21:21.564 --> 21:22.797
and you're gonna have moments

21:22.832 --> 21:24.298
where you just call out
to somebody

21:24.334 --> 21:25.499
and there's nobody there.

21:25.535 --> 21:26.968
I just want you to know,

21:27.003 --> 21:28.970
that never goes away.

21:30.974 --> 21:32.707
Look, I'm sorry, I'm sorry,
I was trying to say

21:32.742 --> 21:34.976
something inspirational, but,
you know, it went where it went.

21:36.980 --> 21:40.047
-But you're gonna be fine.
-BRITTANY: I got to go.

21:40.083 --> 21:43.718
-Where you going?
-The hospital.

21:43.753 --> 21:45.219
Look, I hate to admit this,

21:45.254 --> 21:46.988
but you're gonna find out
about it anyway.

21:47.023 --> 21:49.457
I got a text that Monica
tripped in her loose boots

21:49.492 --> 21:50.958
and broke her ankle.

21:50.994 --> 21:52.760
(laughter)

21:54.764 --> 21:57.832
-Bye. Bye.
-(whooping)

21:57.867 --> 22:01.802
I say, boys, don't date
no girls with loose boots.

22:01.838 --> 22:03.671
That's a tragedy
waiting to happen.

22:03.706 --> 22:05.706
"Oh, God!"

22:07.110 --> 22:10.978
(phone buzzing)

22:11.014 --> 22:12.646
(chuckles)

22:12.682 --> 22:14.415
Little people calling.

22:15.852 --> 22:17.551
Hey, what's up?

22:17.587 --> 22:19.587
Hey, look, I can't wait
till y'all to get here.

22:19.622 --> 22:21.655
I just finished your rooms up,
and they look amazing.

22:21.691 --> 22:23.691
Now, look, both of your rooms
are Black Panther themed.

22:23.726 --> 22:25.726
You know, there was a sale
on Black Panther stuff.

22:25.762 --> 22:29.030
You know they made
a billion dollars, right?

22:30.800 --> 22:34.368
Also on the prayer list,
we got Sister Monica Lewis,

22:34.404 --> 22:36.370
who's one of our new members.

22:36.406 --> 22:40.241
Apparently, uh,
this is very disturbing,

22:40.276 --> 22:42.443
but she suffered an accident
while walking

22:42.478 --> 22:46.080
in her loose boots. Amen.

22:46.115 --> 22:51.018
And she shattered--
not just broke, shattered--

22:51.054 --> 22:54.288
both of her ankles.

22:54.323 --> 22:56.590
Lord Jesus, what we gonna do?

22:56.626 --> 22:56.724
