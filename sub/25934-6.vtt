00:00.800 --> 00:02.839
GARETH: Not terrorists, Angela.

00:02.839 --> 00:06.439
Turds and cleaning fluids
in a lethal combination.

00:06.439 --> 00:08.680
Not a terrorist attack, you say.

00:08.680 --> 00:11.039
No. No worries on that front.

00:11.039 --> 00:12.519
I mean, the Government
wants to do something

00:12.519 --> 00:16.959
about reforming mental health,
and I want you to be part of it.

00:16.959 --> 00:20.479
- (GUNSHOT)
- (SCREAMS)

00:20.479 --> 00:23.360
Are you telling me that there is not
a single account in this place

00:23.360 --> 00:25.119
- that you can open for me?
- No, sir.

00:25.119 --> 00:27.680
OK, what about your
Tiny Tycoon Super Saver?

00:27.680 --> 00:29.439
I wouldn't want to be seen
coming here all the time,

00:29.439 --> 00:32.519
so perhaps we could meet for a coffee?

00:32.519 --> 00:34.479
Roy. Hey, haven't seen you in a while.

00:34.479 --> 00:36.360
Yeah, I know, mate. Look, I'm sorry.

00:36.360 --> 00:38.920
There's just not the same call
for lip-readers.

00:38.920 --> 00:40.439
It's a bit of a shame, but there you go.

00:40.439 --> 00:42.920
Let hell rain down!

00:45.119 --> 00:46.680
Dad promised it to me!

00:46.680 --> 00:47.759
Bullshit, he did!

00:47.759 --> 00:49.759
A summons, who is it? Oh, let me guess.

00:49.759 --> 00:52.560
- Penelope...
- Penelope Evans. Yes, yes.

00:52.560 --> 00:56.959
Uh... can we expect to see more of
you around these parts?

00:56.959 --> 00:59.959
Well, there's no shortage of people
with personal problems.

01:00.759 --> 01:06.800
You know, Penny, I do so miss
the old courtroom.

01:48.959 --> 01:50.959
GARETH: Thank you very much,
ladies and gentlemen,

01:50.959 --> 01:52.839
members of the press,
for your attendance.

01:52.839 --> 01:56.879
Now, I have just returned from
a brief visit with His Excellency

01:56.879 --> 01:58.959
the Governor-General of Australia,

01:58.959 --> 02:01.920
where he commissioned me
to form a new government

02:01.920 --> 02:05.079
as a result of last night's ballot

02:05.079 --> 02:08.319
for the leadership of the
Federal Liberal Party.

02:08.319 --> 02:12.119
Now, at this point, I would like to
pay a heartfelt and sincere tribute

02:12.119 --> 02:16.239
to former Prime Minister Greg
Peters' bold 21 weeks in office.

02:16.239 --> 02:17.360
Well done, Greg.

02:17.360 --> 02:21.839
But I must also say to you,
firmly and sincerely,

02:21.839 --> 02:26.360
that I believe now is the time
for the great ship Australia

02:26.360 --> 02:29.479
to be steered back to a true
and steady course,

02:29.479 --> 02:31.039
for this is truly not the time...

02:31.039 --> 02:32.159
Oh, God.

02:32.159 --> 02:34.360
...for sectional or marginal interests.

02:34.360 --> 02:39.400
We are one nation.
We are one united Australia.

WOMAN: Click on this link if you
want to learn more, Senator Greene.

02:47.839 --> 02:49.839
Ooh, Senator Greene.

02:49.839 --> 02:52.280
You know my name.

02:55.159 --> 02:57.560
Ah, good morning, Glenda.

02:57.560 --> 02:59.959
Enjoying your BuzzStay?

02:59.959 --> 03:02.439
Oh. Oh, shit.

03:02.439 --> 03:03.519
Oh... what?

03:03.519 --> 03:06.360
No, no, I just... I meant to close this,

03:06.360 --> 03:09.400
but I clicked on the link instead of...

03:09.400 --> 03:10.680
I meant to close something.

03:10.680 --> 03:12.680
No, no, no. It's fine, I think.

03:12.680 --> 03:14.360
That's fine, that's fine.

03:14.360 --> 03:15.839
Uh, now. Cup of coffee.

03:15.839 --> 03:17.159
Um... how did you sleep?

03:17.159 --> 03:20.000
I had sweet dreams,
if that's what you meant.

03:20.000 --> 03:24.079
Yeah, no, I pretty much just meant,
"How did you sleep?"

03:24.079 --> 03:25.800
How was... how was the snooze?

03:25.800 --> 03:27.639
Bed comfy?

03:27.639 --> 03:30.479
Comfortable, but a tad lonely.

03:30.479 --> 03:32.800
Well, yeah, oh, well.

03:32.800 --> 03:37.400
Can we talk about our feelings?
There's no point bottling them up.

03:37.400 --> 03:41.720
Oh, well, I'm... I'm a bit of a fan
of the bottle-up, actually.

03:41.720 --> 03:44.720
They're all saying that's...
that's the way to go these days.

03:44.720 --> 03:49.200
My wife's a shrink, and she says
bottling up is very underrated.

03:49.200 --> 03:53.639
Um... she's a big fan of the
bottle-up, as was Freud, apparently.

03:53.639 --> 03:56.680
I'm sure we'll work it out.
Look, Glenda, I've, um...

03:56.680 --> 04:01.119
I've just come out of a complicated,
long-term relationship, so...

04:01.119 --> 04:03.560
I'm not talking about
a relationship, Cleaver.

04:03.560 --> 04:05.800
I'm talking about intercourse.

04:05.800 --> 04:07.280
Intercourse.

04:07.280 --> 04:09.479
Sexual intercourse.

04:09.479 --> 04:12.439
Yes, yes, I... Yes, that's...

04:12.439 --> 04:14.200
Yeah. Can we...?

04:14.200 --> 04:16.680
- (GURGLING)
- I've... What's that noise?

04:16.680 --> 04:20.479
Will you just excuse me for
a moment, please, Glenda?

04:20.479 --> 04:21.920
(GURGLING)

04:21.920 --> 04:25.319
Oh, holy mother. How is that possible?

04:28.720 --> 04:30.519
Oh, no!

04:30.519 --> 04:34.920
Oh, fuck, don't... No, no, no, no!

04:34.920 --> 04:36.680
Oh, no, no, no, no!

04:36.680 --> 04:39.479
Oh, God! Fuck.

04:39.479 --> 04:45.479
Cleaver! (SCREAMS)

04:47.839 --> 04:49.400
- Cleaver.
- Yes?

04:49.400 --> 04:51.079
Hey, Cleaver, Cleaver.

04:51.079 --> 04:53.920
Yeah, yeah. Oh, God. Yes.
I'm scared, Cleaver.

04:53.920 --> 04:55.920
- Will you come with me?
- Look, uh...

04:55.920 --> 04:57.720
Glenda, there's nothing I'd like more,

04:57.720 --> 04:59.319
but I've really got to do a
spot of cleaning here,

04:59.319 --> 05:02.159
and I've got to get up to Sydney
for this charity speech thingy.

05:02.159 --> 05:05.280
- Ugh...
- Please be back by Friday.

05:05.280 --> 05:07.680
I'll make it a night you'll never forget.

05:07.680 --> 05:09.560
Oh... Does she need oxygen?

05:09.560 --> 05:10.839
Ugh...

05:12.039 --> 05:14.600
(MOANS)

05:28.720 --> 05:30.879
The old girl alright?

05:30.879 --> 05:32.800
Yeah, yeah, she'll be fine.

05:32.800 --> 05:36.439
Mate, how is it possible
that something like that

05:36.439 --> 05:38.479
can come out of someone as thin as that?

05:38.479 --> 05:40.680
I mean, that's got to be
double her body weight.

05:40.680 --> 05:44.800
Have you ever, ever seen a poo
that size before?

05:44.800 --> 05:47.639
Oh, yeah. A few.

05:47.639 --> 05:50.200
The thin ones, you know,
they're deceptive, they're...

05:50.200 --> 05:53.839
(SIGHS) They're really the ones
you got to worry about, mate.

05:53.839 --> 05:56.600
- They bottle it all up.
- Do they?

05:56.600 --> 05:58.079
Yeah, the fatties are more evenly spread.

05:58.079 --> 05:59.400
I had no idea.

05:59.400 --> 06:01.800
Oh, that's just science, mate.

06:01.800 --> 06:05.360
- Oh, bloody hell. It's you.
- What?

06:05.360 --> 06:07.239
You're the senator
that stands for nothing.

06:07.239 --> 06:09.119
Oh, yes, yes, yeah.

06:09.759 --> 06:12.519
I've done a bit of work
at parliament myself.

06:13.079 --> 06:15.319
Well, you've done more than I have, then.

06:15.319 --> 06:17.479
The old parliament,
the one under the tarp.

06:17.479 --> 06:20.000
I was probably the last bloke
in there, actually.

06:20.000 --> 06:23.600
- Right, you were in there on the day?
- Few days later.

06:23.600 --> 06:27.439
They sent a plumber into a building

06:27.439 --> 06:30.400
that had been attacked by terrorists
with toxic gas?

06:30.400 --> 06:31.600
Why?

06:32.039 --> 06:34.920
Just had to iron out a few details.

06:34.920 --> 06:36.639
What, toilet details?

06:36.639 --> 06:38.479
I don't just work on toilets, mate.

06:38.479 --> 06:40.400
I mean, why do people think
that we just work on toilets?

06:40.400 --> 06:43.400
- That pisses me off.
- No. No offence.

06:43.400 --> 06:47.600
But... so, sorry, they sent you in
after they put the tarp on?

06:48.479 --> 06:50.200
Yeah, it's, you know...

06:50.200 --> 06:53.959
Well, no, I don't know. Why?
What were you doing in there, mate?

06:53.959 --> 06:55.239
I mean...

06:55.239 --> 06:57.560
You know, the thing was meant to be
a toxic wasteland.

06:57.560 --> 07:00.319
Mate, do me a favour, alright?

07:00.319 --> 07:04.600
This conversation, it never happened.

07:04.600 --> 07:06.639
I'll give you 15% off.

07:06.639 --> 07:08.959
- What?
- We done, bro?

07:08.959 --> 07:11.360
- Yeah.
- Does that include GST?

07:11.360 --> 07:13.800
You're going to need a pretty
heavy-hitting cleaner though, mate.

07:13.800 --> 07:15.439
- (HORN HONKS)
- Oh, yes, of course.

07:17.800 --> 07:20.079
Uh, so 15% off, yeah?

07:20.079 --> 07:23.479
- Cash or card?
- Uh, well, let me just...

07:23.479 --> 07:25.839
Cleaver, you need to be in Sydney
at 12:00.

07:25.839 --> 07:27.959
- You're not even dressed.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. I know, mate.

07:27.959 --> 07:29.879
But look, there is a situation in there

07:29.879 --> 07:31.439
that you can't even imagine, and...

07:31.439 --> 07:32.959
Come on.

07:33.439 --> 07:34.839
Well, how much is this?

07:34.839 --> 07:37.400
- How much is it, mate?
- $850.

07:37.400 --> 07:40.280
$850? Fuck!

07:40.280 --> 07:41.839
But then there's the 15% off.

07:41.839 --> 07:44.920
No, that includes the 15% off. And GST.

07:44.920 --> 07:46.600
Are you kidding me?

07:46.600 --> 07:49.519
My father always told me
I should be a plumber.

07:49.519 --> 07:51.239
Very well.

07:52.560 --> 07:55.720
But I would appreciate a favour today.

07:55.720 --> 07:57.360
(MEOW)

07:57.360 --> 08:03.400
My cat is not well, as you know,
and it's causing me despair.

08:33.360 --> 08:35.680
Why are you answering your car phone?

08:35.680 --> 08:39.119
Uh, well, mate, a bit of
a complicated situation.

08:39.119 --> 08:41.400
Word is you've had, uh,
quite the morning.

08:41.400 --> 08:43.639
Yes, you could say that.

08:43.639 --> 08:46.119
- Plumbing problems.
- Uh, yes.

08:46.119 --> 08:48.879
How do you know about
my plumbing problem?

08:48.879 --> 08:50.000
We're the government.

08:50.000 --> 08:53.479
Look, I was calling 'cause I was
wondering if you needed any help.

08:53.479 --> 08:55.600
You are a valued crossbencher.

08:55.600 --> 08:58.200
Oh, well, you could pay the bill, mate.

08:58.200 --> 08:59.839
That's not going to happen.

08:59.839 --> 09:01.879
OK, then, there's nothing you can do.

09:01.879 --> 09:05.639
Well, we do have a list of
recommended plumbers.

09:05.639 --> 09:06.920
They'll give you 15% off.

09:06.920 --> 09:10.119
Yes, I know. My chief of staff
got a name off that list.

09:10.119 --> 09:12.680
Excellent. Who was it, by the way?

09:12.680 --> 09:16.519
I don't know, some plumber. Jake.

09:16.519 --> 09:19.639
Ah, Jake. And, uh, yeah,
his brother Gordy.

09:19.639 --> 09:22.400
- Yeah, that's right.
- Yeah, good blokes.

09:22.400 --> 09:24.720
- Chatty.
- Well, I suppose so.

09:24.720 --> 09:29.319
You do know that they signed a
nondisclosure agreement with the

09:29.319 --> 09:32.079
Commonwealth about anything
they hear or see in the house.

09:32.079 --> 09:36.959
I hope they weren't too indiscreet,
didn't compromise you at all.

09:36.959 --> 09:43.239
Uh, well, mate, I was just busy
deshitifying myself, so, uh, no.

09:43.239 --> 09:45.079
OK, mate. Well, that's good. Good.

09:45.079 --> 09:47.239
We'll talk soon, eh?

09:47.239 --> 09:50.119
Strange times.

09:51.280 --> 09:54.839
You remember Brian Oakley,
the Defence Minister,

09:54.839 --> 09:58.159
didn't die that day
because of poison gas.

09:58.159 --> 10:00.479
We both know he died on the job
with the Education Minister.

10:00.479 --> 10:02.519
Yes, he died on the job, yes.

10:02.519 --> 10:04.519
So what's that got to do with plumbing?

10:04.519 --> 10:06.759
You tell me.

10:06.759 --> 10:09.119
No. No, mate. You tell me.

You're a driver, you know
a shitload more than I do.

10:12.280 --> 10:14.560

what I think you're thinking.

What are you thinking
I'm thinking you're thinking?

10:19.239 --> 10:21.360
I'm thinking that you're thinking
that... Oh, Christ.

10:21.360 --> 10:23.519
Is this what we've come to?
I'm thinking...

10:24.079 --> 10:27.479
Hmph, I'm thinking that for
economic reasons,

10:27.479 --> 10:30.119
and in the best interests of our nation,

10:30.119 --> 10:33.759
that we consolidate our list of
contractors to this place.

10:33.759 --> 10:38.159
And I'm thinking, in general terms,
about tradespeople, sparkies,

10:38.159 --> 10:41.759
chippies, and in particular,
I'm thinking about plumbers.

10:42.360 --> 10:44.119
Really?

10:44.519 --> 10:46.800
So this is what you're talking about?

10:47.519 --> 10:50.280
Serious consolidation?

10:52.519 --> 10:55.360
Consolidation with extreme prejudice.

10:57.039 --> 11:01.000
Look. I know we're talking
about us going to prison, OK?

11:01.000 --> 11:03.439
We've spent millions
covering up a non-event.

11:03.439 --> 11:05.920
We've bought the biggest bloody tarp
in the world.

11:05.920 --> 11:08.159
I mean, it is a literal cover-up.

11:08.159 --> 11:10.959
It's corruption on a massive scale.

11:10.959 --> 11:17.400
Then consolidation with extreme
prejudice vis-a-vis these plumbers.

11:19.119 --> 11:21.039
That's about our only option, Joe.

Yeah.

12:15.680 --> 12:18.800
Senator Greene, I'm Nadia Vargas.
I am delighted to meet you.

12:18.800 --> 12:21.479
I'm delighted to meet you too, Nadia.

12:21.479 --> 12:23.000
- (PHONE RINGS)
- Oh, sorry.

12:23.000 --> 12:24.439
I'll just get that, hang on.

12:24.439 --> 12:27.000
I'm sorry, what is she...
What's she do...

12:27.000 --> 12:28.400
What's she got in her ear?

12:28.400 --> 12:30.159
Maria Creche, good afternoon.
How may I help your little ones?

12:30.159 --> 12:32.360
Oh, Maria Creche. Maria Creche.

12:34.000 --> 12:35.879
What's she saying? Can you...

12:35.879 --> 12:37.800
She said you're meant to be
seeing your constituents.

12:37.800 --> 12:39.600
OK, can you just translate this for her?

12:40.239 --> 12:45.879
Oh, loathsome mother, Senator Greene
would love to see his constituents,

12:45.879 --> 12:49.400
but he can't find them
under all the Lego and Beanie Boos.

12:52.319 --> 12:54.159
Ah.

12:55.879 --> 12:58.239
100,000.

12:59.759 --> 13:03.720
100,000 what?
Freckles? Barbara Cartland novels?

13:03.720 --> 13:07.879
I will settle the defamation suit
for 100,000.

13:07.879 --> 13:11.680
Oh. Let me get my chequebook out.

13:18.720 --> 13:23.280
(VIDEO PLAYS) "Penny Evans, which
is not her original name, by the way,

13:23.280 --> 13:25.039
"is beyond delusional.

13:25.039 --> 13:28.560
"She is actually a straight up
and down liar.

13:28.560 --> 13:32.200
"She's been lying to all of us,
her constituents in particular,

"for years now.

she bangs on about all the time,

"and married frequently."

13:53.839 --> 13:56.839
So. Well, you're a so-called lawyer.

13:57.400 --> 13:59.560
What part of that's not defamatory?

14:01.000 --> 14:05.560
Well, none of it is defamatory, ah,
because all of it is nice.

14:05.560 --> 14:07.239
Yes, but none of it's true.

14:07.239 --> 14:09.720
Yes, but you told me it was true,
didn't you?

14:09.720 --> 14:11.400
Ooh, have you got evidence of that?

14:11.800 --> 14:16.720
I will settle, under confidential
terms, for $100,000.

14:18.560 --> 14:22.800
You lied to me. I'm going to court.

14:23.519 --> 14:28.159
Alright. Well, this is written
confirmation of my offer,

14:28.159 --> 14:31.720
which I will tend as evidence
in court if you decline.

14:31.720 --> 14:35.159
Should you do so, and I succeed,
which I will,

14:35.159 --> 14:38.959
my lawyers reckon I'll get about
$1 million in damages

14:38.959 --> 14:41.759
and another $500,000 or $600,000
in costs,

14:41.759 --> 14:45.519
because I was prepared to settle
and not waste the court's time.

14:45.519 --> 14:48.639
I don't have a hundred grand, Penny.

14:48.639 --> 14:50.360
Why are you doing this?

14:50.360 --> 14:51.720
Look, Cleaver, it's not for the money.

14:51.720 --> 14:53.600
I just think it's an insult
to this country

14:53.600 --> 14:54.720
that you hold the office you do.

14:54.720 --> 14:58.479
I want you gone, and if I have
to bankrupt you to do it, I will.

14:58.959 --> 15:01.039
Then my party can have two seats
in the Senate.

15:01.039 --> 15:03.920
OK, fine. I'll see you in court.

15:03.920 --> 15:05.239
Bye-bye now.

15:11.519 --> 15:13.400
Nicole!

15:16.119 --> 15:17.639
I think I need Roy.

15:17.639 --> 15:21.200
Uh, well, you owe him $500,
so he won't take our calls.

15:21.200 --> 15:25.000
Have you opened your Tiny Tycoon
Super Saver account yet?

15:25.000 --> 15:28.319
Oh. Now, here's the thing about that.

15:28.600 --> 15:34.119
I may have opened a website
that I shouldn't have opened.

15:34.119 --> 15:36.119
And it looked very authentic,
a sort of banking thing.

15:36.119 --> 15:37.600
They knew my name.

15:37.600 --> 15:40.000
You clicked on a bullshit site.
So what? Have you been skimmed?

15:40.000 --> 15:44.239
Well, it looked really legit,
you know, and, um...

15:44.239 --> 15:50.720
But... but... but the problem is that
I still don't seem to have an account

15:50.720 --> 15:54.079
and the people in finance are saying
that they have put all my pay

15:54.079 --> 15:56.400
- into this account...
- Well, OK.

15:56.400 --> 15:58.079
...that I don't seem to be able
to access.

15:58.079 --> 15:59.879
Why would they do that?

15:59.879 --> 16:02.959
Well, because, um, according to them,

16:02.959 --> 16:07.039
I may have given authorisation
to this web page.

16:07.039 --> 16:08.639
Can I just murder you now?

16:08.639 --> 16:14.079
Because there would not be a jury in
all the land that would convict me.

16:14.479 --> 16:16.560
I still need Roy in here.

16:16.560 --> 16:18.920
Well, you can't have Roy
because you owe him $500.

16:18.920 --> 16:21.400
- Jakub!
- He... (SIGHS)

16:22.959 --> 16:26.879
How would you feel, my friend,
if I said to you,

16:26.879 --> 16:31.639
big slap-up Polish feast
at our joint tonight?

16:31.639 --> 16:33.839
OK, there is no "our joint", Cleaver.

16:33.839 --> 16:37.360
And you can't keep staying at
my place when you're in Sydney.

16:37.360 --> 16:39.560
Could you get Roy on the phone, please?

16:41.879 --> 16:45.600
Mate, I need $500, just quietly.

16:45.600 --> 16:48.800
And I'm looking at another
ten points, Cleaver.

16:48.800 --> 16:52.360
Yeah, I don't know what that means,
mate. But, no problem.

17:05.759 --> 17:07.560
- (KNOCK ON DOOR)
- Yes?

17:08.280 --> 17:10.519
Oh, Cal. Right on time.

17:10.519 --> 17:13.720
Yes, I'll keep this short, Ms Greene.

17:13.720 --> 17:16.079
There's no need.
We have an hour set aside.

17:16.079 --> 17:19.720
I am appalled that the Health
Minister is recklessly spending

17:19.720 --> 17:22.519
this vast sum of money
on women's mental health.

17:22.519 --> 17:24.159
OK.

17:24.159 --> 17:25.959
You'll be out of here in a week.

17:25.959 --> 17:27.400
OK.

17:29.560 --> 17:30.959
Cal?

17:31.360 --> 17:33.319
Did you and your brother ever get on?

17:34.839 --> 17:36.319
My half-brother, you mean?

17:36.319 --> 17:40.119
Yeah, Joe. Did you ever get on?

17:40.119 --> 17:44.519
Dad had a painting that never got
mentioned in his will.

17:44.519 --> 17:47.119
And Dad always promised it to me,

17:47.119 --> 17:50.239
but Joe said that Dad had promised
it to him, which is bullshit!

17:50.239 --> 17:53.560
I mean, Joe didn't even like
farm animals.

17:53.560 --> 17:56.079
That was just something that me
and Dad bonded over.

17:56.079 --> 17:59.360
WOMAN: The thing is, I'm not
a particularly healthy person.

17:59.360 --> 18:02.479
I do run, which is good for weight
and good for general health.

18:02.479 --> 18:08.000
But, I don't... I do secretly drink,
secretly smoke.

18:08.000 --> 18:10.159
It's the stress.

18:10.159 --> 18:16.200
I, um... I only ever really wanted
to play football.

18:16.200 --> 18:18.079
Be kept on the team.

18:18.079 --> 18:20.959
But I...

18:20.959 --> 18:24.360
...I didn't do any better
than 16B's at school.

18:24.360 --> 18:27.680
It's purely emotional.
50 bucks maybe. But he took it!

18:27.680 --> 18:29.720
- So you sued him?
- Of course.

18:29.720 --> 18:31.079
What choice did I have?

18:31.079 --> 18:34.079
Right, so this legal battle that's
been going over this $50 painting.

18:34.079 --> 18:36.479
- It's been going for...
- Seven years.

18:36.479 --> 18:38.920
Cost me upwards of five mill so far.

18:38.920 --> 18:44.800
Nobody knows this, but,
I've only got seven toes.

18:45.560 --> 18:48.920
From birth, it's just a gene thing.

18:48.920 --> 18:53.159
My dad only had five. (WEEPS)

18:53.159 --> 18:56.400
(SOBS) Mummy, Mum.

18:56.400 --> 19:01.400
My mum used to joke about what a
great halfback she would've made.

19:02.239 --> 19:09.039
But then I realised
she was... a socialist...

19:10.280 --> 19:13.879
...and she'd kept it hidden
from us for years.

19:14.400 --> 19:18.600
So I've been doing, well,
I've been doing a fair bit of coke.

19:18.600 --> 19:22.720
Going to clubs and doing a bit of
swinging, which is OK.

19:22.720 --> 19:28.439
So I've got this Healthy Oz
campaign launch next week

19:28.439 --> 19:30.560
and the closer I get to the launch,

19:30.560 --> 19:33.680
the more I just want to get
completely fucked up.

19:33.680 --> 19:35.400
Yeah, but it's not about the money.

19:35.400 --> 19:36.839
But that's actually one of the reasons

19:36.839 --> 19:38.959
your wife is pissed off with you,
isn't it?

19:38.959 --> 19:40.959
- You've had to move house recently.
- Yeah, yeah.

19:40.959 --> 19:44.079
Can we not talk about Jane today?
Can we save it for next week?

19:44.079 --> 19:45.959
Yep, of course.

19:45.959 --> 19:47.879
She scares me.

19:50.360 --> 19:54.959
(SOBS)

19:54.959 --> 19:57.200
- (KNOCK ON DOOR)
- Shit!

19:57.200 --> 19:59.600
It's OK, it's OK. Just check my shoes.

19:59.600 --> 20:01.920
Check my shoes, check my shoes. Coming.

20:04.119 --> 20:10.159
I find this very helpful, Wendy.
Thank you for finding the time.

20:10.159 --> 20:13.039
But no-one needs to know about this,
right?

20:13.039 --> 20:18.680
Absolutely not. And thank you
for the 400K a year, Gareth.

20:20.439 --> 20:23.959
(MARIA HUMS TO HERSELF)

- NADIA: Two.

20:33.680 --> 20:34.759
Oh. Two please.

20:34.759 --> 20:37.639
Stop trying to fatten me up, please.
Stop. Too many.

20:40.920 --> 20:43.239
What brings you to Sydney, Nadia?

20:45.400 --> 20:47.800
(LAUGHTER)

20:47.800 --> 20:50.560
Just a holiday. See the family.

20:50.560 --> 20:52.920
Lydia is a headhunter in
advertising. She's a bigwig.

20:52.920 --> 20:54.680
- Right.
- Modest.

20:54.680 --> 20:56.079
- Oh, really?
- Yes, really.

20:56.079 --> 20:57.319
Very interesting.

20:57.319 --> 21:00.639
You didn't, uh,
mention that you had a sister.

21:00.639 --> 21:01.920
- Really?
- Mm.

21:04.360 --> 21:08.800
(LAUGHTER)

21:08.800 --> 21:11.920
I think it's sweet of you
to include Jakub.

21:11.920 --> 21:15.600
Oh, well, we include Jakub
in everything we do. Don't we, mate?

21:15.600 --> 21:17.360
No. Not in everything we do.

21:17.360 --> 21:21.720
No, not in every thing.
That'd be, a bit, you know,

21:21.720 --> 21:26.280
if there's a good time to be had,
Jakub's there at the top of the list.

21:31.439 --> 21:33.239
(LAUGHTER)

21:34.639 --> 21:36.400
Roy wants cash, by the way.

21:36.400 --> 21:38.439
Oh, God.

21:49.280 --> 21:51.159
Nature calls.

21:54.400 --> 21:57.239
Actually, nature's calling me too.

21:57.239 --> 21:59.119
Oh, nature's having a busy night.

22:38.039 --> 22:41.920
Uh, I'm afraid I must go, Senator.

22:41.920 --> 22:44.119
- MARIA: Really? Oh!
- Bye, mate.

22:48.879 --> 22:50.200
NICOLE: Mama.

22:53.400 --> 22:54.920
I mean, this is delicious.

22:54.920 --> 22:57.400
Ah, you know, you Poles, with your food.

22:57.839 --> 22:59.159
What?

22:59.159 --> 23:02.439
Good... good on you.
Good on... good for you.

23:07.479 --> 23:10.720
That was fantastic.

23:11.159 --> 23:13.600
Really fantastic.

23:17.720 --> 23:21.200
So, Jakub is what? Your strategist?

23:21.200 --> 23:24.280
Jakub? No. No, he's my driver.

23:24.280 --> 23:26.280
Seems very smart.

23:26.280 --> 23:29.400
Well, yeah, I mean,
he's a smart enough guy.

23:29.400 --> 23:33.439
You have to be quite smart to be the
driver for a senator, 'cause I'm...

23:33.439 --> 23:34.759
I liked his suit.

23:35.039 --> 23:36.839
- His suit?
- Mm-hm.

23:37.720 --> 23:40.759
Yeah, I mean, you know,
he's quite a well-dressed guy.

23:40.759 --> 23:42.839
He's quite a clever guy,
I will grant you that.

23:42.839 --> 23:45.720
But you know, the suit, obviously
that's a part of his uniform,

23:45.720 --> 23:47.119
his driver's uniform.

23:47.119 --> 23:49.759
Goes with the job that I gave him.

23:49.759 --> 23:51.839
He has four homes.

23:51.839 --> 23:53.720
What the fuck?

23:53.720 --> 23:55.920
All without mortgages.
How does a driver do that?

23:55.920 --> 23:58.319
Jesus, I have no idea.

23:58.319 --> 24:00.759
I like to help him out with his finances.

24:00.759 --> 24:04.039
You know, 'cause he's a mate
and he's got a wife and...

24:04.039 --> 24:05.560
And two girlfriends.

24:06.319 --> 24:08.639
He was very upfront with me. I like that.

24:08.639 --> 24:10.039
Yeah.

24:10.720 --> 24:17.039
Yes, I've got a... I've got an
ex-wife and a son and a grand...

24:17.479 --> 24:21.360
...piano, because I love to play.

24:21.360 --> 24:23.079
I'm sure they're just chatting.

24:30.439 --> 24:32.200
Well, that was your mistake, Mama.

24:32.200 --> 24:34.959
- What happened to Jakub?
- I don't know. I don't know.

24:43.200 --> 24:45.039
Oh, she's your darling, Mama?

24:45.039 --> 24:47.119
We're both your darlings, Mum.
We're both your daughters!

24:47.119 --> 24:52.239
You are not a Vargas!
You are not your father's daughter.

24:53.959 --> 24:56.800
Jakub has had a vasectomy.
I find that very attractive.

24:56.800 --> 24:58.920
Wow, you really...

24:58.920 --> 25:00.600
What are you doing?

25:00.600 --> 25:02.600
Just touching your shoulder...
on the shoulder.

25:02.600 --> 25:04.839
- Well, please don't.
- OK.

25:04.839 --> 25:06.800
(SOUND OF ARGUMENT)

25:09.360 --> 25:11.879
- Mama, what's the problem?
- She just told me I'm not a Vargas.

25:11.879 --> 25:14.200
- She told you?
- What? You're not a virus?

25:14.200 --> 25:17.200
No, I'm... I'm not a Vargas.
I'm not my father's daughter.

25:17.200 --> 25:19.039
How's that even scientifically possible?

25:19.039 --> 25:20.839
- Why did you tell her?
- I'm a Plimpton.

25:20.839 --> 25:21.879
What's the difference?

25:21.879 --> 25:24.200
- What's the diff? What's the diff?

25:24.200 --> 25:27.759
- You are a...
- Fuck you, Cleaver!

25:51.680 --> 25:55.280
You just... you fucked my boss
within 30 seconds of meeting him.

25:55.280 --> 25:58.479
I didn't want to fuck your boss,
I really wanted to fuck his driver.

25:58.479 --> 26:00.759
He already has a wife and two
girlfriends. That's enough.

26:02.400 --> 26:04.519
Oh, to you, Mama! To you!

26:04.519 --> 26:06.800
My whole life I'm a Vargas.
Turns out I'm a Plimpton.

26:06.800 --> 26:08.200
Why did you tell her?

26:08.200 --> 26:09.519
She knew?!

26:09.519 --> 26:11.400
- What's a Plimpton?
- Shut up!

26:11.400 --> 26:12.680
- What?
- Shut up!

26:12.680 --> 26:14.839
So this is why you've always had
more affection for her, Mama?

26:16.319 --> 26:17.920
That is horseshit, Nic.

26:17.920 --> 26:19.079
We both knew Mum slept round.

26:19.079 --> 26:21.360
- How dare you?
- What?

26:21.360 --> 26:23.200
I didn't know that actually, Nadia.
Thank you.

26:23.200 --> 26:25.759
Nic, I don't even know if I'm a Vargas.

26:25.759 --> 26:27.600
- You are a Vargas!
- Says who, Mama?

26:27.600 --> 26:31.200
Who... who... who was the Plimpton?

26:31.200 --> 26:32.800
(MARIA WEEPS)

26:32.800 --> 26:34.560
Mama, who was the Plimpton?

26:35.319 --> 26:36.519
Mama! Mama!

26:38.039 --> 26:40.239
His name was George.

26:40.680 --> 26:43.039
I met him in New York at a boxing game...

26:44.519 --> 26:46.519
...when I was visiting Uncle Lech.

26:46.519 --> 26:48.720
- George Plimpton?
- What does it matter?

26:48.720 --> 26:50.879
Not THE George Plimpton!

26:50.879 --> 26:53.039
- What do you mean "the"?
- Well, he liked boxing.

26:53.039 --> 26:54.360
He liked boxing, yes?

26:54.360 --> 26:58.759
Yeah, he knew some guys,
but he was no boxer himself.

26:58.759 --> 27:00.319
He just wrote about it.

27:00.319 --> 27:02.519
George Plimpton?!

27:02.519 --> 27:04.079
I mean, the man's a...

27:04.079 --> 27:08.039
He's one of my all-time heroes.
He was unbelievable journalist.

27:08.039 --> 27:10.280
He's a pal of Muhammad Ali.

27:10.280 --> 27:12.560
He covered the Rumble in the Jungle.

27:12.560 --> 27:15.720
He founded the Paris Review.

27:15.720 --> 27:19.159
Yeah, he was in Africa for a week or two.

27:19.159 --> 27:21.759
I remember that other fellow
you mentioned.

27:21.759 --> 27:23.280
Which other fellow?

27:23.280 --> 27:25.759
- The black one.
- What, Muhammad Ali?

27:25.759 --> 27:27.360
Well, if that was his name.

27:27.360 --> 27:29.519
There was a meeting.
Yeah, I met him with George.

27:29.519 --> 27:33.759
So you... you... you had dinner
with Muhammad Ali

27:33.759 --> 27:36.280
and you had sex with George Plimpton?

27:36.280 --> 27:37.680
Oh, yes, that's George.

27:39.119 --> 27:40.920
That's George!

27:43.319 --> 27:45.239
Oh, my God.

27:45.560 --> 27:47.519
Daddy.

27:47.920 --> 27:50.280
- I'm a lawyer. A big lawyer.
- CAL: Yeah.

27:50.280 --> 27:52.280
A man known to be savage.

27:52.280 --> 27:55.959
To have no conscience.
My wife knows I have no conscience.

27:55.959 --> 27:58.360
My two-year-old looks at me
like I have no conscience.

27:58.360 --> 28:00.319
But, Cal, it's been five years.

28:00.319 --> 28:02.920
You've put three of my kids through
school with what you've spent

28:02.920 --> 28:05.479
trying to get this shitty little
painting back from your brother.

28:05.479 --> 28:07.000
He's my half-brother,

28:07.000 --> 28:09.560
and my father wanted me to have
that painting, Francis.

28:09.560 --> 28:12.159
He told me so on his death bed,
and that fuckwit...

28:12.159 --> 28:13.759
Cal, it's your word
against your brother's.

28:13.759 --> 28:14.920
Half-brother.

28:14.920 --> 28:16.280
Cal, we have no proof! You understand?

28:16.280 --> 28:18.079
- It's beautiful!
- No, it isn't.

28:19.519 --> 28:20.959
It's an abomination.

28:22.639 --> 28:26.280
In all my years as a lawyer
I have never said this,

28:26.280 --> 28:28.839
but you have to stop this now.

28:29.560 --> 28:32.600
I actually don't want to take
any more of your money.

28:33.959 --> 28:36.079
It's keeping me up at night, man.

28:37.400 --> 28:42.200
The painting is worth nothing,
and it's insane what you've spent.

28:46.439 --> 28:48.680
Very well, Francis.

28:49.200 --> 28:51.600
Let's consider the matter terminated.

29:03.680 --> 29:04.759
Morning, folks.

29:06.000 --> 29:07.600
Where's Nadia?

29:07.600 --> 29:10.800
- Melbourne.
- Oh, that's right, yeah.

29:13.800 --> 29:16.959
(WISTFUL MUSIC)

29:30.920 --> 29:32.879
(MARIA SIGHS)

29:34.600 --> 29:37.759
Oh. I'm gonna go and have a shower.

29:47.079 --> 29:49.439
Morning. Morning, Prime Minister.

29:49.439 --> 29:52.800
You, you, you, you.
I know you. We've met before.

29:52.800 --> 29:54.759
You're very familiar.

29:54.759 --> 29:57.039
Yes, Melissa Partridge.

29:57.039 --> 30:00.119
We met in Sydney a few years ago
at a couple of functions.

30:00.119 --> 30:01.519
I work for Cleaver Greene.

30:01.519 --> 30:04.039
Oh, God. Love a duck. You poor thing.

30:04.039 --> 30:06.200
Well, good luck with all of that.

30:06.200 --> 30:08.600
It's very nice to see you again, Melissa.

30:08.600 --> 30:10.839
Thank you, Prime Minister.

30:11.400 --> 30:14.519
Shit! Missy! Missy!

30:16.200 --> 30:18.280
Missy? Missy?

30:18.280 --> 30:21.039
How are you, Fluffy?

30:21.039 --> 30:24.519
Oh, Christ alive. (CLEARS THROAT)

30:27.319 --> 30:30.600
Melissa, through here.

30:31.800 --> 30:34.039
No interruptions, people.

30:37.959 --> 30:40.639
Have a seat. Just...

30:44.479 --> 30:47.239
Right, well, first thing. Eh...

30:49.920 --> 30:54.439
Thank you for not putting me
in your book... which I enjoyed.

30:54.439 --> 30:58.360
And the movie, which... (LAUGHS) Oh, God.

30:58.360 --> 31:01.039
Listen, there's not going
to be a sequel, is there?

31:01.039 --> 31:02.360
No.

31:03.720 --> 31:05.479
Thank Christ for that.

31:05.479 --> 31:10.720
So, you and Greene, you're not together?

31:10.720 --> 31:12.119
No.

31:12.119 --> 31:15.239
Well, not that Greene.

31:17.000 --> 31:21.119
Actually, I've had his grandchild.

31:23.639 --> 31:29.079
(LAUGHS)

31:29.079 --> 31:34.119
That's... (LAUGHS)

31:35.119 --> 31:36.959
I'm sorry.

31:37.360 --> 31:39.879
So what is it you do for him?
You do media, do ya?

31:39.879 --> 31:41.319
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

31:45.360 --> 31:48.360
- Come and do it for me.
- What?

31:48.360 --> 31:50.280
Come work for me. The Prime Minister.

31:50.280 --> 31:53.720
You know you don't need
to buy my silence, Gareth.

31:53.720 --> 31:54.839
I won't tell anyone.

31:54.839 --> 31:56.680
I know that.

31:56.680 --> 32:02.800
But I need... I need someone who can
tell a story people want to hear.

32:02.800 --> 32:04.439
I have a baby.

32:04.479 --> 32:06.479
Well, not that story, please.

32:06.479 --> 32:09.079
So what sort of job are you
offering me exactly?

32:10.439 --> 32:12.119
Well, I don't know.

32:12.119 --> 32:16.360
You could... you could pick your own
title, except Prime Minister,

32:16.360 --> 32:17.720
because that is well and truly taken.

32:17.720 --> 32:21.239
But, you know, you could be the...

32:22.239 --> 32:25.959
...the acceptable face of
Australian politics.

32:26.600 --> 32:28.079
Prodigal daughter.

32:32.959 --> 32:39.000
So ex-hooker, ex-drug addict, mother
of a child to an ex-client's son.

32:39.000 --> 32:41.039
Yes, yes, yes!

32:41.039 --> 32:44.959
That is the CV the right
really needs now.

32:44.959 --> 32:46.119
(LAUGHS)

32:47.319 --> 32:49.959
What about those stories
about you and Caitlin?

32:49.959 --> 32:51.400
Are they true?

32:51.400 --> 32:52.920
Oh, who cares? They don't have to be.

32:52.920 --> 32:55.280
There are other stories because...

32:57.439 --> 32:59.800
...I'm a man of many appetites.

33:00.920 --> 33:02.400
I know.

33:06.239 --> 33:08.039
Oh, come on. Come on.

33:08.639 --> 33:10.079
We'll start from page one.

33:12.119 --> 33:15.119
And after taking Greene down
once and for all

33:15.119 --> 33:17.560
but, you know, I think I think Penny
Evans has got that one covered.

33:17.560 --> 33:19.920
Oh, don't take down Cleaver, Gareth.

33:21.159 --> 33:23.119
I wouldn't like that.

33:25.360 --> 33:28.600
DAVID POTTER: It appears,
Mr President, that a blue tarp

33:28.600 --> 33:32.079
is our new national symbol.

33:32.079 --> 33:37.479
A giant blue tarp entirely encasing
Parliament House,

33:37.479 --> 33:42.519
the international symbol that is the
wreckage that is this government.

33:43.079 --> 33:45.200
Have you seen the memes, Mr President?

33:45.519 --> 33:50.720
The world is laughing at us from
Washington DC to London to Beijing,

33:50.720 --> 33:53.639
Minsk, Phnom Penh.

33:53.639 --> 33:56.280
And it wasn't so bloody pathetic
it really would be funny.

33:56.280 --> 33:57.319
It really would.

33:57.319 --> 33:58.879
Senator Potter is warned!

33:58.879 --> 34:00.319
I apologise, Mr President.

34:00.319 --> 34:03.479
You know what? I think we should
change the flag, I really do.

34:03.479 --> 34:06.000
Some people think our flag
should be green and gold.

34:06.000 --> 34:08.239
Other people think that maybe
it should be an ice-cream,

34:08.239 --> 34:12.119
perhaps an Eskimo Pie
or a Golden Gaytime.

34:12.119 --> 34:15.479
But I think a flag
made out of blue plastic

34:15.479 --> 34:18.800
would be a very fitting symbol
of this government.

34:18.800 --> 34:21.680
After all, it is the colour of their ties

34:21.680 --> 34:23.239
and blue is the colour of their eyes

34:23.239 --> 34:27.400
and it is most definitely
the colour of their lies.

34:27.400 --> 34:29.600
Not only that,
you can also wrap yourself up in it

34:29.600 --> 34:32.920
and the entire world can piss
all over you all it wants,

34:32.920 --> 34:35.239
and you can still pretend you're damp,

34:35.239 --> 34:38.039
even when you're up to your neck in shit.

34:38.039 --> 34:40.439
Senator Potter will remove himself
from the chamber

34:40.439 --> 34:42.319
for the rest of the day!

34:42.319 --> 34:48.039
- (APPLAUSE)
- Order! Order!

34:48.039 --> 34:51.839
Order! Order!

34:51.839 --> 34:54.800
POTTER ON VIDEO: "Have you seen
the memes, Mr President?

34:54.800 --> 34:56.920
"The world is laughing at us..."
Look at that.

34:56.920 --> 34:59.720
He's trying to be me. What a dickhead!

34:59.720 --> 35:01.639
That's me.

35:01.639 --> 35:04.119
I mean, he's... he's channelling me.

35:04.119 --> 35:06.959
"If it wasn't so bloody pathetic,
it really would be funny."

35:06.959 --> 35:10.839
She's... she's teaching...
she's teaching him to be me.

35:10.839 --> 35:13.839
I mean, that's all we need, a couple
of hundred mes in the country.

35:13.839 --> 35:15.159
Cleave.

35:15.759 --> 35:18.000
- Roy.
- Jury?

35:18.000 --> 35:19.920
Yes. Yes, mate. Thank you. Yes.

35:19.920 --> 35:22.360
Nicole said you had my money.

35:22.360 --> 35:25.360
Yes. Yeah, talk to him.

35:26.839 --> 35:28.319
Him.

35:33.839 --> 35:35.400
Oh!

35:36.879 --> 35:40.519
What? Somebody doesn't appear
to have representation.

35:40.519 --> 35:44.439
Thought you were gonna have some
fancypants team of lawyers here.

35:45.400 --> 35:47.000
If we're gonna be mano a mano,

35:47.000 --> 35:49.920
this thing is gonna be over
in a nanosecond, OK.

35:49.920 --> 35:52.720
I'll give you 500 bucks
and we walk out of here now.

35:54.239 --> 35:55.519
For the public.

35:55.519 --> 35:58.560
I don't want it to look like I've
got legal representation, Cleaver,

35:58.560 --> 36:00.920
but... I never walk alone.

36:04.239 --> 36:08.600
Right. Rightio, then.

36:14.039 --> 36:15.519
OK.

36:20.600 --> 36:24.639
"Penny Evans, which is not her
original name, by the way,

36:24.639 --> 36:26.159
"is beyond delusional.

36:26.159 --> 36:29.920
"She is actually
a straight up and down liar.

36:29.920 --> 36:31.959
"She's been lying to all of us,

36:31.959 --> 36:34.680
"her constituents in particular,
for years now.

36:34.680 --> 36:39.239
"Her modest farming family that she
bangs on about all the time

36:39.239 --> 36:41.800
"turns out to have been one of
Australia's biggest

36:41.800 --> 36:43.600
"agricultural concerns."

36:44.680 --> 36:46.720
Senator Evans.

36:52.839 --> 36:56.200
Your Honour, I apologise,
but as you can see,

36:56.200 --> 36:57.639
I am not in a financial position

36:57.639 --> 37:00.560
to be able to afford
expensive legal counsel.

37:00.560 --> 37:03.360
Some friends and supporters
have come to my aid,

37:03.360 --> 37:06.000
and to them I say I'm truly grateful.

37:06.000 --> 37:08.039
Um... (NERVOUS LAUGH)

37:08.039 --> 37:12.680
It... it's daunting for me as a
wool classer from South Australia

37:12.680 --> 37:18.159
to have to combat an experienced QC
like Cleaver Greene.

37:18.159 --> 37:20.200
Well, Senator Greene is not a QC.

37:20.200 --> 37:22.239
He is not even a member of the Bar.

37:22.239 --> 37:24.720
Oh. Oh, I apologise, Your Honour.

37:24.720 --> 37:26.239
Oh, yes. I see.

37:26.239 --> 37:30.639
He was disbarred for disparaging
and disrespecting the bench

37:30.639 --> 37:32.839
when he was found guilty of murder.

37:32.839 --> 37:34.439
Your Honour...

37:34.439 --> 37:36.280
No, the defendant
was eventually acquitted

37:36.280 --> 37:38.319
of conspiracy to commit murder.

37:38.319 --> 37:39.879
Oh. I am sorry, Your Honour.

37:39.879 --> 37:43.519
I must have misheard. It was
conspiracy to commit murder.

37:43.519 --> 37:45.720
Acquitted on appeal, Senator.

37:45.720 --> 37:49.600
Oh, yes, appeal.
Acquitted on appeal of murder.

37:49.600 --> 37:52.360
Conspiracy to commit murder, Senator.

37:52.360 --> 37:54.119
Yes, I apologise again. Of course.

37:54.119 --> 37:59.600
It was conspiracy to commit... murder.

37:59.600 --> 38:01.319
- Murder!
- CLEAVER: Oh!

38:01.319 --> 38:03.360
(GASPS) Oh! Oh! Ooh!

38:03.360 --> 38:05.479
Are you OK, Senator Evans?

38:05.479 --> 38:07.319
Yes, I'm fine.

38:07.319 --> 38:11.159
Your Honour, I'm sorry,
it's just some shoulder pain

38:11.159 --> 38:13.479
from a would-be assassin's bullet.

38:13.479 --> 38:17.159
Someone was hired to kill me by an enemy.

38:17.159 --> 38:19.759
Are you fuck... kidding me.

38:19.759 --> 38:21.800
I beg your pardon, Senator Greene?

38:21.800 --> 38:26.600
Your Honour, I... I would be
the first person...

38:26.600 --> 38:29.119
Well, I'm probably not the first,

38:29.119 --> 38:32.560
but I would certainly be in
a group of Australians

38:32.560 --> 38:36.039
who would deplore what has happened
to Senator Evans and her shoulder,

38:36.039 --> 38:37.879
and I'm sure that she's not accusing me

38:37.879 --> 38:41.280
of being involved in this shooting,

38:41.280 --> 38:46.479
given that I was standing next to her
at the time in a zebra suit.

38:46.479 --> 38:47.639
(LAUGHTER)

38:47.639 --> 38:51.879
But, Your Honour, could we please
move on to the substance of these

38:51.879 --> 38:54.560
spurious defamation proceedings?

38:55.639 --> 38:58.759
Actually, Your Honour,
I think it was Senator Greene

38:58.759 --> 39:01.839
who commissioned and paid for
my assassination attempt.

39:01.839 --> 39:03.239
Are you kidding me?

39:03.239 --> 39:05.639
Your Honour, could we please
not allow her

39:05.639 --> 39:09.400
to turn this into a criminal circus?

39:09.400 --> 39:12.600
This, after all,
is... is... is a civil circus.

39:12.600 --> 39:16.000
Well, I think he tried to kill me.

39:16.000 --> 39:18.839
Isn't that material to this case
in some way?

39:18.839 --> 39:21.079
Oh, man, she is a piece of work,
Your Honour.

39:21.079 --> 39:23.319
I offered him $100,000
to make this go away.

39:23.319 --> 39:24.720
Are you kidding me?

39:24.720 --> 39:27.879
Your Honour, she asked me for a
hundred grand to make this go away.

39:27.879 --> 39:31.079
Well, I don't think we should be
wasting any of more of your time,

39:31.079 --> 39:34.879
Your Honour, on quibbling about who
asked for or who offered $100,000.

39:34.879 --> 39:36.639
Oh, on the contrary, Your Honour.

39:36.639 --> 39:39.560
I think it's highly material
to this case that we examine who,

39:39.560 --> 39:43.280
who offered who and who asked who
for a hundred thousand

39:43.280 --> 39:49.079
because she asked me for $100,000
to make this thing disappear.

39:49.079 --> 39:50.839
And you refused the offer?

39:50.839 --> 39:52.159
Of course I did, Your Honour.

39:52.159 --> 39:55.000
You do realise the liability of
costs you have just admitted,

39:55.000 --> 39:56.280
Senator Greene.

39:56.280 --> 40:00.239
They will be substantial in the
event you fail in these proceedings.

40:00.239 --> 40:02.400
Of course, Your Honour.

40:04.119 --> 40:06.079
Senator Evans.

40:08.759 --> 40:10.200
You're fucked.

40:10.200 --> 40:15.479
Being just a wool classer, I have
no expertise in these matters.

40:15.479 --> 40:18.479
But I think... I believe
the expert evidence before us

40:18.479 --> 40:21.920
that confirms that the bullet
that shot me was fired

40:21.920 --> 40:24.200
from a Bling 4 bolt-action rifle.

40:24.200 --> 40:25.680
Your Honour, I'm sorry,

40:25.680 --> 40:30.400
but I fail to see what any of this
has to do with the case at hand.

40:30.400 --> 40:33.119
I would request that Your Honour
instruct the plaintiff

40:33.119 --> 40:35.680
to continue with the defamation case

40:35.680 --> 40:39.560
that is currently being ventilated
in this courtroom.

40:39.560 --> 40:40.680
I am, Your Honour.

40:41.639 --> 40:46.639
The jury has seen the footage, which
was broadcast across the country,

40:46.639 --> 40:50.600
in which I was called a liar
and lies were told about me,

40:50.600 --> 40:55.439
arguably destroying my electoral base.

40:55.439 --> 40:57.479
My case is done,

40:57.479 --> 41:01.360
apart from any further investigation
into the person

41:01.360 --> 41:03.439
who ordered my assassination.

41:03.439 --> 41:04.519
Thank you.

41:04.519 --> 41:07.479
It would seem it's time to open
your case, Senator Greene.

41:07.479 --> 41:09.519
Thank you, Your Honour.

41:09.519 --> 41:13.600
Your Honour, the plaintiff asked me
to have a drink with her

41:13.600 --> 41:16.200
on the night in question, which I did,

41:16.200 --> 41:18.920
and she told me a story,
which I believed,

41:18.920 --> 41:23.879
about her antecedents, which I then
went on to repeat on air.

41:23.879 --> 41:27.759
- That's a lie!
- The plaintiff will resume her seat.

41:27.759 --> 41:31.039
- Proceed, Senator Greene.
- Thank you, Your Honour.

41:31.039 --> 41:36.119
Now, the plaintiff told me this story
to trap me into these circumstances,

41:36.119 --> 41:40.239
which she claims are defamatory.

41:40.239 --> 41:44.159
Now, I have variously called
the plaintiff smart,

41:44.159 --> 41:47.920
well-educated, and from a good family.

41:47.920 --> 41:53.079
Is that, ladies and gentlemen, where
we are now in the world of politics?

41:53.079 --> 41:56.439
That you cannot be seen to be
a cut above?

41:56.439 --> 41:58.720
Because if that is the case,

41:58.720 --> 42:03.680
then we are in a serious and tragic
race for the bottom.

42:03.680 --> 42:05.759
Now, ladies and gentlemen of the jury,

42:05.759 --> 42:07.319
this is, in the final analysis,

42:07.319 --> 42:11.039
quite simply a case of her word
against mine,

42:11.039 --> 42:14.879
and my word is the truth.

42:14.879 --> 42:17.079
Thank you, Your Honour.

42:25.079 --> 42:26.720
- So?
- The jury hate you.

42:27.360 --> 42:29.600
I saw one say to another...

42:31.000 --> 42:33.920
..."He tried to kill her.
Don't believe a word he says."

42:37.920 --> 42:40.479
Nicole, would you excuse
for a moment, please?

42:55.360 --> 42:59.239
There's only one choice available
to the Senator at this point.

42:59.239 --> 43:00.800
Which is?

43:00.800 --> 43:03.119
You tell him, Senator.
I'm just the driver.

43:03.119 --> 43:05.239
I need to be shot, Roy.

43:06.720 --> 43:09.720
We need to create the illusion
that there's a madman out there.

43:09.720 --> 43:11.879
Well, not an illusion. There clearly is.

43:11.879 --> 43:13.720
Well, yes, there is.
I mean, I didn't shoot her.

43:13.720 --> 43:15.759
There is a madman out there.

43:15.759 --> 43:19.720
What we need to do is
balance the argument.

43:19.720 --> 43:22.360
There clearly are crazy people out there

43:22.360 --> 43:25.000
who want to kill politicians
on both sides.

43:25.000 --> 43:26.280
Well, in your case on no side.

43:26.280 --> 43:30.319
The whole issue of me
trying to murder Penny

43:30.319 --> 43:32.720
needs to be wiped off the table, OK?

43:32.720 --> 43:34.560
So we need a shooting, Roy.

43:34.560 --> 43:39.159
Obviously not fatal, but something
a little more serious than Penny's.

43:39.159 --> 43:41.879
I mean, that's how she's winning in
there, mate, with all these morons.

43:41.879 --> 43:43.360
It's this sympathy bullshit.

43:43.360 --> 43:48.920
So I need something
a little worse than hers.

43:48.920 --> 43:50.560
You want me to hire a shooter?

43:50.560 --> 43:55.039
Yes, yes, but just to be clear,
not fatal, OK?

43:55.039 --> 43:59.800
Not fatal, just badly wounded is
what Jakub and I were thinking.

43:59.800 --> 44:02.920
I'm just a driver. I'm just a lip-reader.

44:02.920 --> 44:07.959
Roy, we both know that you've hired
shooters in the past.

44:07.959 --> 44:09.759
Ages ago, Cleave.

44:09.759 --> 44:12.439
Fuck! Gotta be three years.

44:12.439 --> 44:15.000
You defended a dozen of them.
You pick one.

44:15.000 --> 44:18.119
Senator, I know someone
who'll do it for ten.

44:18.119 --> 44:20.560
- Ten?
- He's a marksman.

44:20.560 --> 44:23.280
Actually an Olympian. He won't miss.

44:23.280 --> 44:25.200
I can get it done for six and a half.

44:25.200 --> 44:28.800
- An Olympian?
- No, but Commonwealth Games.

44:28.800 --> 44:30.639
Senator, you wanna risk?

44:30.639 --> 44:33.920
Oh, mate. No, no, I'm sorry.
Commonwealth Games.

44:33.920 --> 44:36.119
I mean, you wouldn't understand
'cause you're a Pole.

44:36.119 --> 44:39.600
But we hold the Commonwealth Games
in very high regard out here.

44:39.600 --> 44:41.759
Don't we, Roy?

44:41.759 --> 44:47.839
So, Roy, to be clear, not fatal.

44:47.839 --> 44:51.000
OK? Not fatal.
Just a flesh wound, alright?

44:51.000 --> 44:54.920
So I'm thinking, you know,
shoulder or rump, OK?

44:54.920 --> 44:57.239
And we can just
wipe this shit off the table

44:57.239 --> 45:00.920
because she is just a lying fraud, OK?

45:00.920 --> 45:04.439
And he's gonna sort you out
with the six and a half.

45:04.439 --> 45:06.239
You sure you wanna go cheap on this?

45:06.239 --> 45:10.000
Mate, I'm being fiscally responsible.

45:10.639 --> 45:12.560
As you wish, Senator.

45:12.560 --> 45:19.560
Oh, and Roy, whoever does this has to
use a Bling 4 bolt-action rifle, OK?

45:19.560 --> 45:20.879
Same as Penny's.

45:20.879 --> 45:23.600
That may cost a little bit extra.

45:23.600 --> 45:25.560
That would be right. Roy, Roy...

45:28.200 --> 45:31.519
...I'm not gonna end up with a bullet
in my brain, am I, mate?

45:31.519 --> 45:32.560
No. Trust me.

45:32.560 --> 45:35.159
In any case, I know the right surgeon.

45:35.159 --> 45:37.119
- You like these?
- Oh, my God. They look much better.

45:37.119 --> 45:39.600
A square frame.
Mm. I thought they... (LAUGHS)

45:39.600 --> 45:41.639
- No, so much better. It's incredible.
- No, no, no.

45:41.639 --> 45:46.439
I felt like... like it was
the first time...

45:47.400 --> 45:49.759
...I'd felt free since I was
seven years old.

45:51.639 --> 45:53.479
You set me free.

45:56.360 --> 45:57.959
Thank you.

45:59.039 --> 46:00.519
You're welcome.

46:02.560 --> 46:05.360
(SIGHS) It's getting late.

46:06.879 --> 46:10.680
You... wanna get a drink? Are you hungry?

46:11.239 --> 46:13.920
I mean, I'm not paying for this session.

46:13.920 --> 46:16.639
The government is,
so technically I'm not your patient.

46:16.639 --> 46:19.079
- No, I'd love to get a drink.
- Great.

46:19.079 --> 46:20.239
It's not really a comedy,

46:20.239 --> 46:23.720
but I am pleased to say I managed to
get through two seasons of The Crown

46:23.720 --> 46:26.920
with my republican ideals fully intact.

46:26.920 --> 46:29.439
I'm quite keen on the royals
at the moment, actually.

46:29.439 --> 46:31.039
- Really?
- Mm.

46:32.600 --> 46:33.839
Anyway... I don't think so.

46:33.839 --> 46:35.920
- Have you seen Friday Night Lights?
- No. What's that?

46:35.920 --> 46:37.119
It's the best series ever made.

46:37.920 --> 46:40.119
I get the feeling that that's not
a new series, though.

46:40.119 --> 46:41.280
- Have you not seen that?
- No.

46:41.280 --> 46:43.519
- Oh, my God!
- Who's in that?

46:43.519 --> 46:46.079
- Connie Britton.
- Mm-hm.

46:46.079 --> 46:49.360
- And, ah... Coach.
- And Coach?

46:49.360 --> 46:52.280
And Coach. Connie Britton and Coach.

46:56.280 --> 46:57.920
- Night.
- Night. Night.

46:57.920 --> 46:59.519
Hey...

47:00.039 --> 47:03.119
Why did you kick me out of that
meeting with Roy and Jakub today?

47:03.119 --> 47:05.200
'Cause it was... it was nothing.

47:05.200 --> 47:06.959
It wasn't very important.

47:06.959 --> 47:09.560
Oh, my God.
You're planning something stupid.

47:09.560 --> 47:11.319
What? Why would you... why would you
assume that?

47:11.319 --> 47:12.720
Because I bloody know you.

47:12.720 --> 47:16.039
It was a strategy meeting, right?

47:16.039 --> 47:18.400
Right, with your driver
and your lip-reader

47:18.400 --> 47:20.079
but not your chief of staff.

47:20.079 --> 47:24.319
Look, you need to get some shuteye,
I think,

47:24.319 --> 47:29.000
'cause you're looking
very... sleepyheaded,

47:29.000 --> 47:32.319
and snoozy, Nadia.

47:33.360 --> 47:34.560
Nadia?

47:35.400 --> 47:37.920
- What?
- You just called me Nadia.

47:38.319 --> 47:40.759
- I didn't.
- You just called me Nadia.

47:40.759 --> 47:42.319
I did not.

47:42.319 --> 47:48.039
I said sleepyheaded tonight, goodnight.

47:48.720 --> 47:50.159
Right?

47:50.759 --> 47:56.119
So... fuckety night, crazy lady.

48:12.439 --> 48:16.720
(COOL MUSIC)

48:52.680 --> 48:54.079
(GUNSHOT)

48:54.079 --> 48:55.959
(SCREAMS)

48:57.200 --> 49:01.039
It's barely a nick.
It's fuckin' hopeless!

49:01.039 --> 49:03.680
I've done more damage
trimmin' my fuckin' nasal hair.

49:03.680 --> 49:06.600
- This is a disaster!
- Yeah, well, I didn't wanna hurt ya.

49:06.600 --> 49:09.360
Mate, the whole point of the exercise
was to hurt me, yes?

49:09.360 --> 49:14.839
Remember? Shoot him in a soft fleshy
part, notably, you know, the arse.

49:14.839 --> 49:18.959
Fuck, I... and I'm sorry, Roy.
Commonwealth Games?

49:18.959 --> 49:21.439
This man was never in the
Commonwealth Games.

49:21.439 --> 49:23.239
- Yeah, I was.
- What, for shooting?

49:23.239 --> 49:24.720
- Yeah, I was.
- Bullshit!

49:24.720 --> 49:26.639
- I was!
- Well, I'm never watching them again.

49:26.639 --> 49:29.159
Oh, great!

49:29.920 --> 49:31.000
Look at this!

49:31.360 --> 49:34.639
That's how I'm supposed to look.
Why does she look like the victim?

49:34.639 --> 49:35.959
Because you pushed me over.

49:35.959 --> 49:38.720
Yeah, tryin' to save your life. Come on!

49:38.720 --> 49:40.519
All you had to do was just
keep walking, Cleave.

49:40.519 --> 49:43.000
Sudden hits movements during a hit,
not very useful, mate.

49:43.000 --> 49:45.680
- Down to you, Cleave.
- Oh, like everything else, mate.

49:45.680 --> 49:48.560
But it's fine. You don't have to be
hurt to appear injured.

49:48.560 --> 49:51.039
I'll get my friend.
It'll cost you another five.

49:51.039 --> 49:53.400
Oh, another five?
So are you counting this, Roy?

49:53.400 --> 49:54.519
That's 10 now.

49:54.519 --> 49:58.639
Commonwealth Games my arse,
and why are you doing hits?

49:58.639 --> 50:01.879
I thought you had your fancypants
restaurant chain with Kirsty?

50:01.879 --> 50:04.639
Yeah. Can we just not talk about
Kirsty please, Cleave?

50:04.639 --> 50:06.119
Ooh! I see!

50:06.119 --> 50:10.639
But, for another five, I reckon
I could solve all your problems.

50:10.639 --> 50:13.039
Another five, huh?

50:13.039 --> 50:14.200
I know who shot Penny Evans.

50:14.200 --> 50:16.519
- What?
- Well, I was offered the job,

50:16.519 --> 50:18.839
but I was busy so I just referred it
to a mate of mine.

50:18.839 --> 50:20.920
And? She ordered it herself.

50:20.920 --> 50:22.879
I knew it.

50:22.879 --> 50:25.119
I fuckin' knew it!

50:25.119 --> 50:27.200
Unbelievable!

50:27.200 --> 50:32.280
What kind of a scumbag
orders a hit on themselves?

50:40.560 --> 50:41.800
(SNEEZES)

50:43.039 --> 50:45.439
REPORTER: Senator... Senator Greene...

50:47.119 --> 50:49.680
Are they any closer to...

50:49.680 --> 50:53.680
- Senator, just a few words.
- Do you know the sniper?

50:53.680 --> 50:58.319
Any ideas on the sniper, Senator?

51:06.879 --> 51:08.400
Oh.

51:08.400 --> 51:09.680
How you doing, Cleaver?

51:09.680 --> 51:11.360
Glad you pulled through.

51:15.639 --> 51:17.800
I want you to withdraw this action

51:17.800 --> 51:21.280
and resign from Parliament this
afternoon for health reasons.

51:21.280 --> 51:22.920
(LAUGHS)

51:24.839 --> 51:26.519
Have a look.

51:30.879 --> 51:33.720
That's the name of the fellow
who shot you.

51:34.119 --> 51:37.039
And I know who organised it, so...

51:37.959 --> 51:40.920
...walk away or it's prison.

51:52.680 --> 51:55.680
After advice from my doctors,

51:55.680 --> 51:58.759
it has become apparent,
following my shooting,

51:58.759 --> 52:04.400
the stress of these proceedings and
my relentless work as a senator

52:04.400 --> 52:09.200
has absolutely taken its toll on me
and affected my health very badly.

52:09.200 --> 52:12.039
As such, I will be withdrawing.

52:12.039 --> 52:14.560
I have withdrawn the proceedings
against Senator Greene,

52:14.560 --> 52:17.800
and I will be informing the
President of the Senate

52:17.800 --> 52:20.639
that I resign my seat immediately.

52:28.759 --> 52:30.680
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

52:38.759 --> 52:40.000
What do you want?

52:42.119 --> 52:44.519
I'm withdrawing my claim on the painting.

52:45.639 --> 52:47.639
Nope. Seriously.

52:48.319 --> 52:50.800
Look, Jay, we're both here now.

52:50.800 --> 52:54.319
And there is serious stuff
to be done and, quite frankly,

52:54.319 --> 52:57.319
we've both been behaving like
a pair of spoilt brats for years.

52:57.319 --> 52:59.319
I mean, God knows how much have we spent

52:59.319 --> 53:02.239
trying to own a painting
that we both know to be crap?

53:02.759 --> 53:04.920
I know, but Dad said...

53:04.920 --> 53:07.119
No, don't go there.

53:08.759 --> 53:13.280
Look, we need to rebuild
our relationship.

53:13.959 --> 53:17.479
Not just for you and me,
but for the nation.

53:17.959 --> 53:22.159
I mean, the party's all at sea
without us, if we're divided.

53:23.639 --> 53:27.800
Well, God knows, I don't wanna spend
any more money on lawyers.

53:27.800 --> 53:29.039
No.

53:31.680 --> 53:33.239
So...

53:35.000 --> 53:36.600
...you get the painting.

53:43.680 --> 53:46.959
It really is a piece of shit,
isn't it? (LAUGHS) I mean.

53:46.959 --> 53:48.879
I mean, look at it. God!

53:48.879 --> 53:51.319
Are we morons or what?

53:51.319 --> 53:53.439
I mean, how much have we spent on
this bit of kindling?

53:53.439 --> 53:54.519
10 mill?

53:54.519 --> 53:58.000
Mate, we are two pricks
forever linked by a third prick.

53:58.000 --> 53:59.560
(BOTH LAUGH)

53:59.560 --> 54:03.560
Here's to a nest of pricks.
Here's to a nest of pricks, mate.

54:09.079 --> 54:11.879
I can't tell you how happy
this makes me, Cal.

54:13.039 --> 54:15.079
Oh, it's alright, mate.

54:15.079 --> 54:17.920
Bulldog. (CHUCKLES)

54:17.920 --> 54:20.000
We're together again.

54:21.800 --> 54:24.639
And, mate, you and I are unstoppable.

54:29.959 --> 54:32.000
I... I love you, Jay.

54:33.400 --> 54:35.519
I love you, too, Piggy. Come here.

54:39.200 --> 54:41.280
Oh, God!

54:41.280 --> 54:43.079
Can you get me a tissue, please, mate?

54:43.079 --> 54:45.519
It's embarrassing.

55:01.119 --> 55:03.319
Piggy! You little arse wipe!

55:35.200 --> 55:38.639
I knew you'd be back before I left.

55:38.639 --> 55:41.680
(RAUNCHY MUSIC)

55:52.839 --> 55:56.360
For God's sake, officer. Do your
bloody job and arrest this man!

55:56.360 --> 56:00.280
Are you gonna pour, Caitlin Farquhart?

56:00.280 --> 56:02.879
- No. No using the toilet.
- Thank you.

56:04.600 --> 56:08.000
If I can't convince the Chinese
to remain neutral, God forbid.

56:08.000 --> 56:09.839
You look absolutely radiant.

56:09.839 --> 56:11.360
Get me a drink, Cal.

56:11.360 --> 56:13.800
And you've created
an international incident.

56:13.800 --> 56:15.639
What in Christ's name
did you say to them?!

56:15.639 --> 56:17.280
- Liars.
- You appear on their website.

56:17.280 --> 56:19.039
- All of them, liars. Fake news.
- There is footage.

56:19.039 --> 56:21.759
- Just drive, Cleaver!
- Oh, fine! Oh, God!
