01:17.917 --> 01:20.652
They say as soon as you have
to cut down on your drinking

01:20.720 --> 01:22.387
you have a drinking problem.

01:25.691 --> 01:27.759
My mind is a jumble.

01:27.827 --> 01:29.828
I can't organize my thoughts

01:29.895 --> 01:32.497
and typing feels like work.

01:34.533 --> 01:36.901
I've never written more than 250 words,

01:36.969 --> 01:38.737
not even in High School...

01:38.804 --> 01:41.706
Five paragraphs, 50 words apiece.

01:41.774 --> 01:43.742
God, I was lazy.

01:45.611 --> 01:47.412
I should've finished High School.

01:47.480 --> 01:49.547
Everything could have been different.

02:04.664 --> 02:06.464
Are you okay, sir?

02:59.351 --> 03:01.086
Summer's coming.

03:01.153 --> 03:03.254
I smelled it.

03:03.322 --> 03:05.957
I kind of thought I smelled corn,
which is impossible.

03:07.860 --> 03:09.494
There it was again.

03:10.796 --> 03:12.063
Perfume.

03:26.011 --> 03:27.946
Morning, Miss Blankenship.

03:28.013 --> 03:29.848
How was your surgery?

03:29.915 --> 03:31.683
It was a nightmare...

03:31.751 --> 03:33.752
The ether and the blindness...

03:33.819 --> 03:35.286
And then I got the goggles.

03:35.354 --> 03:36.955
So everything's good?

03:37.022 --> 03:39.257
I'll tell you... I was blind

03:39.325 --> 03:41.926
- and now I see.
- Well, good.

03:41.994 --> 03:43.928
- If you need more time...
- I'm fine, Roger.

03:45.531 --> 03:46.931
I'm kidding around here.

03:48.100 --> 03:49.467
My book's at home.

03:49.535 --> 03:52.137
Can you give me the number
for a Bethany van Nuys?

03:57.843 --> 03:59.344
May... Maybe lift it up and drop it down.

04:00.780 --> 04:02.881
I'm stronger than you,
but I'm not that strong.

04:02.948 --> 04:04.949
Stop, stop....

04:05.017 --> 04:07.285
- He's right.
- I feel like Margaret Mead.

04:07.353 --> 04:09.387
You know what, Harry?
I think this is a show.

04:09.455 --> 04:11.356
Okay, we're gonna do it.

04:11.423 --> 04:12.857
Harry, get out of the way.

04:19.964 --> 04:22.065
What is going on out here?

04:22.134 --> 04:24.068
I'll be honest, I don't know.

04:24.136 --> 04:26.037
I got blockaded on my way
back from the men's room.

04:26.105 --> 04:27.939
Thank you, gentlemen....

04:28.007 --> 04:30.909
- Everyone back to work.
- It took my watch.

04:30.976 --> 04:33.344
- What?
- Ken was buying a Clark bar...

04:33.412 --> 04:34.681
But it ate my change, and since

04:34.682 --> 04:36.114
Danny's not here, we went to Peggy.

04:36.182 --> 04:38.183
But it turns out Joey's
got the smallest hands.

04:38.250 --> 04:39.651
No, I said I had done it before.

04:39.718 --> 04:41.820
Why don't you put another
dime in the machine

04:41.887 --> 04:43.655
- and pull again?
- Do you really think we didn't try that?

04:43.722 --> 04:45.023
- This thing is a bandit.
- Yeah.

04:45.090 --> 04:46.457
Cut it out!

04:46.525 --> 04:48.026
Don't make me come out here again.

04:48.093 --> 04:49.661
Sorry, mom.

04:49.728 --> 04:51.329
Pardon?

04:51.397 --> 04:53.364
Okay. Hey, it's over.

04:53.432 --> 04:55.133
I'm trying to get my watch.
What am I supposed to do?

04:55.201 --> 04:58.036
Call the complaint number.
Have an adult solve this problem.

04:58.103 --> 04:59.771
What is going on out here?

04:59.839 --> 05:01.739
I was in the midst of an extremely
important telephone call.

05:01.807 --> 05:04.242
Joan was just handing out demerits...

05:04.310 --> 05:06.945
Joey, in my office.

05:07.012 --> 05:08.913
- Oh.
- Go easy on him.

05:08.981 --> 05:11.549
A private spanking... Just like my dream.

05:11.617 --> 05:13.618
When did we get a vending machine?

05:17.890 --> 05:20.358
I know you're a freelancer and
you spend time in other offices,

05:20.426 --> 05:22.727
but you should know this
behavior is not tolerated here.

05:22.795 --> 05:24.762
- Yes, ma'am.
- I should let you know

05:24.830 --> 05:26.331
there's a problem now between us.

05:26.398 --> 05:27.665
Why are you always on my case?

05:27.733 --> 05:29.901
Because you are particularly disrespectful.

05:29.969 --> 05:32.170
No, I'm not. Stan's worse.

05:32.238 --> 05:35.206
Maybe he's better at his job.

05:37.209 --> 05:38.776
I'm glad you're amused.

05:38.844 --> 05:41.379
You're so arrogant.

05:41.447 --> 05:43.982
Me? What do you do around here

05:44.049 --> 05:45.984
besides walking around like
you're trying to get raped?

05:46.051 --> 05:47.952
Excuse me?

05:48.020 --> 05:49.954
I'm not some young girl off the bus.

05:50.022 --> 05:51.322
I don't need some
madam from a Shanghai

05:51.323 --> 05:52.390
whorehouse to show me the ropes.

05:58.697 --> 06:00.598
Oh, I'm sorry.
I didn't know you were in here.

06:00.666 --> 06:03.001
Where the hell else would I be?
This is my office.

06:03.068 --> 06:05.470
And you all better stop
cutting through here.

06:05.537 --> 06:07.105
It's not a thoroughfare.

06:07.172 --> 06:09.741
Take the extra steps. You could use them.

06:11.076 --> 06:12.477
You're right.

06:13.879 --> 06:17.282
Go ahead. I'm leaving anyway.

06:17.349 --> 06:18.650
I'm sorry.

06:29.628 --> 06:31.162
Oh no.

06:34.166 --> 06:35.967
Oh, Miss Blankenship, good to see you.

06:36.035 --> 06:38.469
I mean, nice to see you.
I mean, welcome back.

06:38.537 --> 06:42.006
- Let me help you with those.
- Finally, someone offers.

06:42.074 --> 06:46.377
I told you I can see with the glasses.

06:46.445 --> 06:49.914
- I'm out of cigarettes.
- I've got your liquor.

06:49.982 --> 06:52.417
I only have two hands.

06:52.484 --> 06:56.587
- I'm set.
- And then you're not.

06:56.655 --> 06:58.256
Take those back to the storeroom,

06:58.324 --> 07:00.258
and while you're there
get me some cigarettes.

07:00.326 --> 07:02.160
Your wife called earlier.

07:02.227 --> 07:05.596
- She's not my wife.
- Mrs. Francis said to remind you

07:05.664 --> 07:08.366
that you can't have the kids this weekend.
It's very complicated.

07:08.434 --> 07:10.034
It's Bobby's birthday party Sunday.

07:10.102 --> 07:11.803
It's gene's birthday.

07:11.870 --> 07:14.472
Did you want me to buy him or her a gift?

07:15.674 --> 07:16.741
No.

07:37.129 --> 07:38.997
What a pleasant surprise.

07:54.413 --> 07:56.381
You don't mind that I'm home early, do you?

07:56.448 --> 07:58.416
You said you didn't want watch me pack.

07:58.484 --> 08:00.952
You don't even want to say goodbye.

08:01.020 --> 08:02.653
I don't.

08:04.256 --> 08:06.858
Joanie, it's basic training.
I'll be back.

08:06.925 --> 08:09.694
You said they use live ammunition.

08:12.264 --> 08:15.700
Come on. Come in here.

08:23.809 --> 08:25.877
Greg, that doesn't make everything better.

08:25.944 --> 08:28.513
- It makes it worse.
- It's eight weeks.

08:28.580 --> 08:30.148
I'm gonna come back in uniform.

08:30.215 --> 08:31.549
You know you'll like that.

08:33.852 --> 08:36.721
What am I gonna do?
Who am I gonna talk to?

08:36.789 --> 08:40.191
Well, you'll talk to your friends at work.

08:51.804 --> 08:54.906
Is this the way you want
to spend this time, crying?

09:04.817 --> 09:07.752
- I can't.
- Mmm, sure you can.

09:07.820 --> 09:11.289
Just pretend we're in some midtown hotel

09:11.356 --> 09:14.692
and we both snuck away for the afternoon.

09:38.283 --> 09:40.818
More and more every day about Vietnam.

09:40.886 --> 09:43.654
I hope it's not another Korea.

09:45.090 --> 09:46.624
I sound like a little girl,

09:46.692 --> 09:48.192
writing down what happened today.

09:52.564 --> 09:55.099
Sunday is gene's birthday party.

09:55.167 --> 09:58.136
I know I can't go.

09:58.203 --> 10:00.104
I keep thinking about him.

10:01.740 --> 10:04.108
He was conceived in a moment of desperation

10:04.176 --> 10:06.644
and born into a mess.

10:23.778 --> 10:25.278
A list of things I'd like to do.

10:25.297 --> 10:27.165
One,

10:27.232 --> 10:29.300
climb mount Kilimanjaro...

10:29.368 --> 10:32.136
Go anywhere in Africa, actually;

10:32.204 --> 10:35.406
two, gain a modicum

10:35.474 --> 10:37.074
of control over the way I feel.

10:39.444 --> 10:41.045
I want to wake up

10:42.447 --> 10:44.115
and I want to be that man.

10:50.422 --> 10:52.256
Could you get that to el jefe?

10:55.360 --> 10:59.197
So mountain dew... everything
kind of fell apart there.

10:59.264 --> 11:02.166
- They don't like the work.
- Too bad.

11:02.234 --> 11:04.168
Well, somebody showed a
couple of bottlers the work

11:04.236 --> 11:06.771
and they don't like witches brewing things.

11:06.838 --> 11:08.906
They don't like the occult in general.

11:08.974 --> 11:11.709
And you told them it's their
hillbilly working a still?

11:11.777 --> 11:13.611
I did, but the fact remains

11:13.679 --> 11:15.379
that in the world of sodie pop

11:15.447 --> 11:17.682
Pepsi is the tail and the
bottlers are the dog.

11:17.749 --> 11:19.016
They just want us to change the drawing.

11:20.953 --> 11:22.587
Except it's damaged goods.

11:22.654 --> 11:24.055
They're never gonna want
to see that board again.

11:24.122 --> 11:26.657
- Start over.
- I did it with Joey.

11:26.725 --> 11:28.326
Do you want Stan to take over?

11:28.393 --> 11:31.162
You're spreading me awful thin.

11:31.230 --> 11:32.830
Do you want me to tell
Joan to figure it out?

11:32.898 --> 11:35.766
"It"? You don't even know what "it" is.

11:35.834 --> 11:38.002
Miss Blankenship, get Joan in here.

11:38.070 --> 11:39.937
She startles when you do that.

11:40.005 --> 11:43.975
I had an uncle who was blind.

11:44.042 --> 11:46.744
She's not blind. She's recovering
from cataract surgery.

12:15.641 --> 12:18.843
He would come in the room
and he would say...

12:23.081 --> 12:25.916
- What can I do for you?
- A redo on mountain dew.

12:25.984 --> 12:28.719
I want to make Joey full
time for a couple of weeks.

12:28.787 --> 12:32.390
I'd have to double-check
on his availability,

12:32.457 --> 12:34.158
but are you sure he's the right fit?

12:34.226 --> 12:37.595
- He did the first round.
- And we're redoing it.

12:37.663 --> 12:39.463
It's more complicated than that.

12:41.600 --> 12:43.685
Well, this may not be the time or

12:43.686 --> 12:45.770
the place to bring this up but...

12:45.837 --> 12:48.339
- What now?
- I've been hearing complaints about him.

12:48.407 --> 12:52.209
- Really?
- He's not a gentleman with the girls.

12:52.277 --> 12:55.112
Okay. One juicy story?

12:55.180 --> 12:57.348
I'll protect those concerned

12:57.416 --> 12:59.917
but it involves an extremely blue joke.

12:59.985 --> 13:02.620
- When?
- It doesn't matter.

13:02.688 --> 13:05.255
Fine, you can tell it to me later.
Boys will be boys.

13:05.323 --> 13:06.524
Of course,

13:06.591 --> 13:09.727
but I'm going to call in other books.
There's too much to do.

13:12.658 --> 13:15.458
I know the joke.
This guy balls are so big...

13:15.967 --> 13:17.702
- Are we done?
- Sure.

13:23.608 --> 13:26.477
Can you tell Ray Charles to
come in here and clean this up?

13:29.114 --> 13:30.981
And as soon as you get to Hollywood,

13:31.049 --> 13:32.750
you find out that that myth is...

13:32.818 --> 13:34.585
Well, it had some truth to it.

13:34.653 --> 13:36.287
There is instant fame.

13:36.355 --> 13:38.456
What's this have to do with "Peyton place"?

13:38.523 --> 13:40.324
Well, we went down to the set

13:40.392 --> 13:42.860
and Ryan was doing this scene
against another rival...

13:42.928 --> 13:45.629
I can't tell you who...
And the guy was awful.

13:45.697 --> 13:48.165
I start to hear him talk
about a young fresh face,

13:48.233 --> 13:49.800
wholesome but a little mischievous.

13:49.868 --> 13:51.702
Am I crazy?

13:51.770 --> 13:54.605
I don't understand.
You want to be an actor?

13:54.673 --> 13:57.708
Does that sound like me? That's you.
You could do it.

13:57.776 --> 14:00.077
I know the right people...
Maybe not the big screen,

14:00.145 --> 14:01.812
but the small screen definitely.

14:01.880 --> 14:03.848
I'm kind of down to earth.

14:03.915 --> 14:07.685
You're so handsome.
I showed them a picture.

14:07.753 --> 14:09.987
How'd you get a picture?

14:10.055 --> 14:11.617
I sent one of those polaroids from the

14:11.618 --> 14:13.057
Christmas party to Bernie Kowalski.

14:13.125 --> 14:15.526
Mr. Crane, I hate to interrupt you,

14:15.594 --> 14:18.429
but I have Peggy Olson out
here looking for Mr. Baird.

14:20.499 --> 14:22.933
Well, thank you for thinking of me.

14:23.001 --> 14:24.702
You're too modest, you know that?

14:28.707 --> 14:30.040
What were you doing in there?

14:30.108 --> 14:32.009
Everyplace I've worked
there's always some old fairy

14:32.077 --> 14:33.778
who comes onto me,
but that was the weirdest by far.

14:33.845 --> 14:35.813
Yes, everybody wants you, Joey.

14:35.881 --> 14:38.516
- It happens a lot.
- What did you do to Joan?

14:38.583 --> 14:41.218
- I told her off.
- Well, you shouldn't have.

14:41.286 --> 14:43.026
- She's important around here.
- Let me

14:43.027 --> 14:44.722
tell you something about the big ragu.

14:44.790 --> 14:48.025
We're creative, and she's
an overblown secretary.

14:48.093 --> 14:49.693
Fine, don't listen to me.

14:49.761 --> 14:51.629
There's a Joan in every company.

14:51.696 --> 14:53.464
My mother was a Joan,

14:53.532 --> 14:55.366
always telling everybody what to do.

14:55.434 --> 14:56.854
She even wore a pen around her neck

14:56.855 --> 14:58.235
so people would stare at her tits.

14:58.303 --> 15:02.206
She's not your mother, and she
and Lane basically run this place.

15:02.274 --> 15:04.775
Okay, message received.

15:06.278 --> 15:08.679
Ugh, is it time to go yet?

15:18.312 --> 15:20.180
Glad you could make it.

15:20.247 --> 15:22.582
Well, we were on our way
to the theater anyway.

15:22.650 --> 15:25.618
Ralph Stuben, this is my wife Betty.

15:25.686 --> 15:28.154
- Pleased to meet you.
- I hope you don't mind.

15:28.222 --> 15:30.390
The Congressman wanted
me to do this immediately

15:30.457 --> 15:32.292
and he didn't want me
to do it over the phone.

15:32.359 --> 15:34.227
She doesn't mind,

15:34.295 --> 15:36.262
and she's very discreet.

15:36.330 --> 15:38.331
That's the curse of a political wife...

15:38.399 --> 15:39.725
That and having to eat dinner with

15:39.726 --> 15:40.934
a lot of people you don't know.

15:41.001 --> 15:43.336
Betty's no stranger to public service.

15:43.404 --> 15:44.944
So what show did you see?

15:44.945 --> 15:46.439
Why don't we get a drink at the bar?

15:49.510 --> 15:51.344
It'll only be a minute.

15:54.982 --> 15:56.149
Thank you.

15:59.153 --> 16:03.656
So are you a Felix or an Oscar?

16:03.724 --> 16:05.825
Like most men I'd rather be an Oscar,

16:05.893 --> 16:08.027
but I'm probably a Felix....

16:09.763 --> 16:12.131
Every date feels like
a first date with you.

16:12.199 --> 16:14.133
Is that good or bad?

16:14.201 --> 16:16.769
It's just I know you must
be seeing someone else.

16:16.837 --> 16:19.172
And don't say no, because
it'll just hurt me more.

16:20.574 --> 16:23.710
Look, I'm here with you right now.

16:23.777 --> 16:25.845
We're on a date

16:25.913 --> 16:28.047
and I thought we were
getting to know each other.

16:28.115 --> 16:29.649
It doesn't just accumulate.

16:29.717 --> 16:32.952
It takes intense, prolonged contact.

16:34.822 --> 16:36.789
Don't you want to be close with anyone?

16:38.092 --> 16:39.626
I do.

16:41.395 --> 16:43.663
I know we're from different generations

16:43.731 --> 16:46.599
but I'm going to need more from you.

16:46.667 --> 16:49.035
We are from different generations,

16:49.103 --> 16:50.970
because I don't remember
women pushing this hard.

16:52.339 --> 16:53.973
And I'm not seeing anyone.

16:54.041 --> 16:55.908
I'm working.

16:55.976 --> 16:58.311
All the time.

16:58.379 --> 16:59.712
Well, I get excited when you call

16:59.780 --> 17:02.015
and then I don't hear from you.

17:02.082 --> 17:03.759
We don't have to get married for me

17:03.760 --> 17:05.484
to show you off at the country club.

17:05.551 --> 17:08.253
Don.

17:08.321 --> 17:09.922
How are you?

17:11.392 --> 17:13.259
I'm fine, Henry.

17:13.327 --> 17:16.429
Henry, Betty, this is Miss van Nuys.

17:16.497 --> 17:19.499
- Bethany.
- Enjoy your dinner.

17:26.640 --> 17:29.075
My goodness, what was that?

17:29.143 --> 17:32.145
Well, that was actually my ex-wife

17:32.212 --> 17:35.148
and her husband

17:35.215 --> 17:37.550
and some slob who's about to have
the worst dinner of his life.

17:37.618 --> 17:39.552
What? Her?

17:52.700 --> 17:55.435
Well, first of all, my official
capacity if anyone asks...

17:55.502 --> 17:56.803
I'm here to thank you for securing

17:56.870 --> 17:59.172
the Governor's endorsement
for Congressman Lindsay.

17:59.239 --> 18:01.674
That's no small feat, I'm sure.

18:01.742 --> 18:04.043
Well, rocky only hates him
because he's handsome.

18:04.111 --> 18:06.846
Well, not to worry.

18:06.914 --> 18:08.348
Lindsay just wants to be Mayor.

18:08.415 --> 18:10.683
Any talk of the White House is fiction.

18:10.751 --> 18:13.386
Huh. I guess he hasn't
seen the cover of "Life."

18:15.522 --> 18:16.556
Okay.

18:16.623 --> 18:19.759
Hypothetically,

18:19.827 --> 18:22.328
the Congressman is putting
together a team with his eye on '72

18:22.396 --> 18:27.033
and well, it would be built...

18:27.101 --> 18:29.969
If it were going to be built... Around you.

18:32.840 --> 18:35.308
And yes, he doesn't want
rocky to have you either.

18:39.413 --> 18:41.781
Elizabeth, do you know what you want?

18:41.849 --> 18:43.883
Honey, this part is almost over.

18:43.951 --> 18:45.985
I'm sorry, you'll have to excuse me.

18:50.891 --> 18:53.559
One drink and she gets flushed.

18:53.627 --> 18:56.362
Yeah, my wife has the other problem.

19:04.705 --> 19:06.739
- Are you okay in there, ma'am?
- Yes, I'm fine.

19:11.111 --> 19:13.880
- You dropped your purse.
- I'll take it.

19:35.869 --> 19:37.804
What did you want me to do,
put you in a cab?

19:37.871 --> 19:39.972
That wouldn't be right.

19:40.040 --> 19:42.041
I can't believe you made me
sit there and look at them.

19:42.109 --> 19:43.976
Nobody said you had to look at them.

19:44.044 --> 19:47.246
You need a drink?
Well, what are you, a wino?

19:47.314 --> 19:50.450
You need a drink? That is not
something you're allowed to say.

19:50.517 --> 19:52.819
Oh, now you decide what
I can and can't say?

19:52.886 --> 19:55.288
I was in a marriage like that before.

19:55.355 --> 19:57.924
You're gonna run into him.
It's a small town.

19:57.991 --> 20:01.327
- I hate him.
- Hate's a strong word, Betty.

20:01.395 --> 20:03.296
I hate Nazis.

20:03.363 --> 20:05.231
I have an ex-wife. She bothers me.

20:05.299 --> 20:07.500
I don't like seeing her. I don't hate her.

20:07.568 --> 20:09.602
- You're a saint.
- I'm an adult.

20:09.670 --> 20:12.638
It was upsetting.
Can't you let me have that?

20:12.706 --> 20:15.074
Not when it ruins the whole evening.

20:15.142 --> 20:17.877
This man is asking me to
take Lindsay all the way.

20:17.945 --> 20:21.214
That could happen.
Don Draper doesn't have a say.

20:21.281 --> 20:25.651
- You're right. Who cares about him?
- You do.

20:25.719 --> 20:27.587
He's taking up too much space in your life,

20:27.654 --> 20:29.889
maybe in your heart.

20:29.957 --> 20:32.358
That's ridiculous.

20:32.426 --> 20:35.027
Look,

20:36.330 --> 20:37.797
maybe we rushed into this.

20:37.865 --> 20:39.198
"We"?

20:39.266 --> 20:41.667
I was six months pregnant when we met.

20:43.470 --> 20:45.872
- Pull over.
- Are you kidding me?

20:45.939 --> 20:48.007
Let me out, Henry.

20:48.075 --> 20:50.142
No, you know what? Let me out at the house,

20:50.210 --> 20:52.545
because you don't want
to live there anyway.

20:52.613 --> 20:56.849
You can stay at a hotel or
wherever you were when I met you.

20:56.917 --> 20:59.986
In your mansion with your servants.

21:00.053 --> 21:01.954
Shut up, Betty. You're drunk.

21:25.846 --> 21:27.713
What are you doing?

21:27.781 --> 21:29.749
Making you comfortable.

21:44.498 --> 21:46.465
She's a sweet girl

21:46.533 --> 21:49.068
and she wants me to know her,

21:49.136 --> 21:50.970
but I already do.

21:53.807 --> 21:55.775
People tell you who they are,
but we ignore it

21:55.842 --> 21:58.978
because we want them to
be who we want them to be.

22:05.819 --> 22:07.787
To be continued.

22:13.493 --> 22:15.294
I bet she was thinking
of that line all night.

22:18.865 --> 22:20.600
I looked up at the Barbizon

22:20.667 --> 22:22.401
and I thought of all the women in there...

22:22.469 --> 22:24.837
One in every room...

22:24.905 --> 22:27.340
Touching themselves to sleep.

22:30.978 --> 22:32.712
Waverly and 6th.

22:36.183 --> 22:37.783
I like sleeping alone,

22:37.851 --> 22:40.086
stretching out like a skydiver,

22:41.421 --> 22:43.255
cool patches to roll onto.

22:44.558 --> 22:46.025
I just appreciate it more.

22:50.475 --> 22:53.911
No. No! I'm talking now!

22:54.637 --> 22:58.140
I don't care where you go and
I don't care what you do!

22:58.208 --> 23:00.776
So in order...

23:00.844 --> 23:03.779
Would you let me talk? I want my key back,

23:03.847 --> 23:06.849
I don't want to see your shorts on my floor

23:06.916 --> 23:08.117
and I don't want you complaining

23:08.184 --> 23:09.618
that I don't cook 'cause I don't cook!

23:11.821 --> 23:14.523
You know what, David?
Go sitting in the ocean!

23:14.591 --> 23:15.824
Good morning.

23:21.064 --> 23:22.765
Are you leaving already?

23:27.037 --> 23:29.772
Were you going to say goodbye?

23:29.839 --> 23:32.174
I thought you could use the sleep.

23:34.844 --> 23:36.512
I'm sorry, Henry.

23:38.948 --> 23:40.649
Come over here.

23:52.962 --> 23:55.697
I don't want to have to
defend myself all the time.

23:55.765 --> 23:57.866
All the time?

23:57.934 --> 24:00.335
Henry, I'm really sorry.

24:01.938 --> 24:03.672
I know.

24:03.740 --> 24:05.741
Get some sleep.

24:09.279 --> 24:10.979
Carla took the kids to school.

24:12.549 --> 24:15.584
Henry, he was the only
man I'd ever been with.

24:18.955 --> 24:20.489
I'll call you later.

25:10.373 --> 25:12.157
It tastes good, because it still

25:12.158 --> 25:14.109
basically tastes like mountain dew.

25:14.177 --> 25:17.279
And it's very simple to make.
I call it jet fuel.

25:17.347 --> 25:20.482
Rocket fuel, and I like the
simplicity of the idea.

25:20.550 --> 25:23.685
- Young people, hillbillies.
- Xerox crapped out again.

25:23.753 --> 25:25.254
I think I killed it.

25:27.690 --> 25:30.092
I'll run this specimen over to the lab.

25:30.160 --> 25:31.560
It's delicious.

25:34.063 --> 25:37.166
Ah. You're a haircut, you know that?

25:37.233 --> 25:38.901
You need three ingredients for a cocktail.

25:38.968 --> 25:41.236
Vodka and mountain dew is an emergency.

25:47.377 --> 25:49.511
Don wants our freelance
art director Joey Baird

25:49.579 --> 25:51.246
put on full time for the next three weeks.

25:51.314 --> 25:53.115
None of my business I suppose.

26:00.356 --> 26:02.791
I really think this vending
machine is a troublemaker.

26:02.859 --> 26:05.227
I think it's been a great success.

26:05.295 --> 26:07.229
Revenue is climbing.

26:07.297 --> 26:11.033
I was gonna suggest we
get a sandwich machine.

26:11.100 --> 26:12.601
We'd probably get 40% of the work force

26:12.602 --> 26:14.102
keeping busy through lunch.

26:14.170 --> 26:16.538
Or we'd end up with a
bunch of fat secretaries

26:16.606 --> 26:18.273
who think the whole afternoon is lunchtime,

26:18.341 --> 26:20.642
because there's always another
sandwich around the corner.

26:20.710 --> 26:23.178
There have been a lot of complaints.

26:24.614 --> 26:26.215
Did you tell them to call the number?

26:29.352 --> 26:31.553
What do you think they're doing
in there... Lane and Joan?

26:31.621 --> 26:34.590
It's an unholy alliance.

26:34.657 --> 26:36.325
I know exactly what they're doing in there.

26:37.827 --> 26:41.396
Joan's on the desk, boobs on the blotter.

26:41.464 --> 26:44.433
Lane's behind her, 
probably has a bowler hat.

26:44.500 --> 26:45.667
Am I wrong?

26:45.735 --> 26:47.603
Hey, don't do that.

26:47.670 --> 26:49.538
I'm not doing anything. Joan's doing it.

26:53.209 --> 26:55.077
Mountain dew-dah.

26:55.144 --> 26:58.313
Give me three cocktails with at
least three ingredients each.

26:58.381 --> 27:00.249
Peggy Olson,

27:00.316 --> 27:03.252
pioneering the science of wet blanketry.

27:03.319 --> 27:05.120
You love her.

27:10.059 --> 27:11.927
Holy Francis calling.

27:23.940 --> 27:27.075
- This is Don.
- Hello, Don. Henry Francis.

27:27.143 --> 27:28.477
Sorry to bother you at work.

27:28.544 --> 27:30.512
I assume it's important.

27:30.580 --> 27:32.447
It is but not dire.

27:34.450 --> 27:38.053
Okay. What can I do for you?

27:38.121 --> 27:40.856
I bought a boat and I...

27:40.923 --> 27:42.324
Well, I'd like to put it in the garage

27:42.392 --> 27:44.226
and I don't have the clearance
with your things there.

27:45.395 --> 27:46.928
No, of course.

27:46.996 --> 27:49.331
I can probably have some movers take them,

27:49.399 --> 27:51.933
put them in storage somewhere.
I can take it off the rent.

27:52.001 --> 27:54.069
No. No, that's okay.

27:54.137 --> 27:55.704
I should probably come and get them myself.

27:57.907 --> 28:00.008
Gene's birthday party's on Sunday.

28:01.177 --> 28:02.544
I know.

28:02.612 --> 28:05.013
So I think Saturday
would be best, don't you?

28:08.217 --> 28:10.385
I see.

28:10.453 --> 28:12.287
The boat's coming next week so...

28:12.355 --> 28:14.056
Fine.

28:14.123 --> 28:15.590
I'll come at noon.

28:26.202 --> 28:27.969
Miss Blankenship, can I get some coffee?

28:33.887 --> 28:36.188
I just lost 30 cents in the machine.

28:36.256 --> 28:37.984
How is that possible?

28:37.985 --> 28:39.952
Well, I wanted a pack of life savers

28:40.020 --> 28:41.754
so I put in a nickel and it didn't work.

28:41.822 --> 28:43.923
So I looked in my purse and
all I had was a quarter,

28:43.991 --> 28:45.124
so then I lost a quarter too.

28:45.192 --> 28:47.293
Was the exact-change light on?

28:47.361 --> 28:49.395
I started with the exact change.

28:49.463 --> 28:51.898
Oh, Peggy, it's a nickel.

28:51.965 --> 28:54.734
I'm not calling that number.
No one ever answers.

28:54.802 --> 28:56.335
I can't believe you.

28:56.403 --> 28:59.071
Fine, then give me some life savers.

29:12.986 --> 29:16.322
- Who did that?
- Did what?

29:16.390 --> 29:18.825
That pornographic drawing.

29:18.892 --> 29:22.428
It's a very brave person

29:22.496 --> 29:24.163
that does something anonymously.

29:24.231 --> 29:25.965
It's a very brave person who does that.

29:26.033 --> 29:28.167
It's still illegal in many States you know.

29:35.209 --> 29:38.945
I can't wait until next year
when all of you are in Vietnam.

29:39.012 --> 29:41.047
You will be pining for the day

29:41.114 --> 29:43.082
when someone was trying
to make your life easier.

29:43.150 --> 29:45.785
And when you're over there,

29:45.853 --> 29:48.387
you're in the jungle and
they're shooting at you,

29:48.455 --> 29:52.158
remember you're not dying for me,
because I never liked you.

29:59.333 --> 30:01.634
- Joan.
- Don't worry. I'm not going home.

30:03.470 --> 30:05.371
Jesus. Scorched earth.

30:05.439 --> 30:07.607
- What's wrong with her?
- I told you not to do that.

30:07.674 --> 30:09.609
- Come on, Peggy.
- It's a joke.

30:13.714 --> 30:15.748
She's still patting around
for the buzzer. I'm sorry.

30:15.816 --> 30:18.117
What do you want?

30:22.289 --> 30:23.923
Joey taped it to Joan's window.

30:23.991 --> 30:27.393
- Really?
- Yes, and it's disrespectful to Joan

30:27.461 --> 30:29.362
and it's disrespectful to me.

30:29.429 --> 30:31.864
Narrative, forced perspective...
Are you sure Joey did this?

30:31.932 --> 30:34.634
Yes, I told him not to.

30:34.701 --> 30:36.836
Well, I wouldn't tolerate
that if I were you.

30:36.904 --> 30:38.704
But you have no problem with it?

30:38.772 --> 30:41.207
I didn't say that.

30:41.275 --> 30:43.142
Look, Peggy, just go fire him.

30:43.210 --> 30:45.478
Me?

30:45.546 --> 30:47.947
I thought you would go out
there and yell at him.

30:48.015 --> 30:50.049
Yell at him, fire him. Look, believe me...

30:50.117 --> 30:51.584
You do not want me involved in this.

30:51.652 --> 30:53.519
People will think you're a tattletale.

30:53.587 --> 30:55.955
Dr. Miller has arrived.

30:57.157 --> 30:59.258
Send her in.

30:59.326 --> 31:02.461
You want some respect?
Go out there and get it for yourself.

31:03.697 --> 31:06.566
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Have a seat.

31:10.637 --> 31:12.705
Is everything all right?

31:12.773 --> 31:14.040
Yes.

31:18.712 --> 31:20.346
Joey, can I speak to you for a minute?

31:20.414 --> 31:21.747
- You want one?
- No.

31:32.926 --> 31:34.560
I'm sorry, okay?

31:34.628 --> 31:37.430
Good. Now go apologize.

31:37.497 --> 31:39.031
What? Then she'll know I did it.

31:39.099 --> 31:41.267
You did do it. I told you not to.

31:41.335 --> 31:42.902
Come on. It's funny.

31:42.970 --> 31:44.870
Really? Would you show it to Lane?

31:44.938 --> 31:46.205
He would think it's funny.

31:46.273 --> 31:48.240
What if it were Don on his knees?

31:48.677 --> 31:51.811
See? This is why I don't like working
with women. You have no sense of humor.

31:53.113 --> 31:54.780
You're fired.

31:56.617 --> 31:58.417
All right, all right.
I see the nostrils are flared.

31:58.485 --> 32:01.120
- I'll go apologize.
- No, get your things.

32:01.188 --> 32:03.022
- Are you serious?
- I am.

32:04.491 --> 32:06.425
We'll see what Don has to say about that.

32:06.493 --> 32:08.361
Don doesn't even know who you are.

32:10.397 --> 32:12.398
I'm sorry it didn't work out.

32:12.466 --> 32:15.334
Hang on. Come on. This is crazy.

32:15.402 --> 32:17.269
It's just a job, Joey.
You'll get another one.

32:24.211 --> 32:26.345
Well, I was wrong about you.

32:40.761 --> 32:42.194
What's going on?

32:42.262 --> 32:44.363
Watch out, fellas. The fun's over.

32:44.431 --> 32:47.333
- What?
- That's all, folks.

32:47.401 --> 32:49.835
- Are you serious?
- A little bug bit me.

32:49.903 --> 32:51.871
Well, I'll give you a call.
We'll have a drink.

32:55.509 --> 32:57.977
Stan, throw Vick Chemical
on the back burner.

32:58.045 --> 32:59.845
You're on mountain dew.

33:04.851 --> 33:06.919
You know, these guys may be embarrassed

33:06.987 --> 33:09.388
by having some professional
tell them what to do.

33:09.456 --> 33:11.490
He'll take advice from another man.

33:11.558 --> 33:14.627
Not if he knows more.

33:14.695 --> 33:17.363
You know I'm right about auto parts.
I used to sell cars.

33:17.431 --> 33:20.132
Yes, but we still have to do it.

33:22.035 --> 33:23.836
God, this is boring.

33:23.904 --> 33:27.907
I think I'm hungry. Do you want to eat?

33:27.974 --> 33:30.509
- You mean order in?
- I don't know.

33:30.577 --> 33:31.977
You seem kind of dressed up.

33:33.346 --> 33:35.214
We could take Fillmore
parts with us if you want.

33:37.452 --> 33:41.887
Just to clarify...
You'd like to have dinner with me?

33:45.592 --> 33:46.992
Yes.

33:48.995 --> 33:51.530
You asked me out the first
time I came in here.

33:51.598 --> 33:53.866
Why would it be different for me now?

33:55.969 --> 33:58.137
It just felt like the timing is right.

34:01.274 --> 34:03.309
So why don't we do that?

34:03.376 --> 34:05.344
You could ask me out for dinner

34:05.412 --> 34:07.880
at some future date instead of...
I don't know...

34:07.948 --> 34:10.248
Tacking it onto a workday
like an afterthought...

34:12.219 --> 34:13.985
I could do that.

34:15.388 --> 34:17.389
Saturday night far enough in the future?

34:18.824 --> 34:21.092
Not normally, but you're in luck.

34:22.295 --> 34:24.096
Good.

34:24.164 --> 34:25.598
Okay then.

34:27.333 --> 34:28.868
I've got enough to go on here.

34:28.935 --> 34:30.569
Okay.

34:30.637 --> 34:32.204
- Good night.
- Good night.

34:40.655 --> 34:41.922
It's Francine.

34:41.989 --> 34:43.223
Come in.

34:45.426 --> 34:47.928
Whoa. I'm all bitten up.

34:48.210 --> 34:50.813
This is my potato salad bowl,
but this one's yours.

34:50.880 --> 34:53.149
Well, thank you.

34:53.216 --> 34:55.016
Henry was going to pick one
up on his way home from work,

34:55.085 --> 34:56.686
but he's been so busy.

34:56.753 --> 34:59.355
Oh, Betty, he's very ambitious.

35:00.557 --> 35:01.957
He's mad at me.

35:02.025 --> 35:03.826
Why would that be so?

35:05.195 --> 35:08.397
Oh God, if I can make it
through this weekend...

35:08.465 --> 35:10.399
It's a two-year-old's birthday party,

35:10.467 --> 35:13.703
you'll have help, and no one cares.

35:15.238 --> 35:16.605
Oh.

35:17.974 --> 35:19.475
Is he coming?

35:21.745 --> 35:23.746
I told him about it.

35:23.814 --> 35:25.781
Now I can only hope he
won't show up and ruin it.

35:25.849 --> 35:27.616
Well, he won't.

35:27.684 --> 35:29.552
We ran into him in the city...

35:29.619 --> 35:31.654
On a date.

35:31.722 --> 35:34.657
Bethany van Nuys...
She was all of 15.

35:36.860 --> 35:38.928
I misbehaved.

35:38.995 --> 35:42.198
Henry didn't understand it for some reason.

35:42.265 --> 35:44.400
Why do you let him bother you?

35:44.468 --> 35:47.169
We see him walking out with
the kids some weekends.

35:47.237 --> 35:50.606
- Carlton calls him "that sad bastard."
- That's an act.

35:50.674 --> 35:53.075
He's living the life, let me tell you.

35:53.143 --> 35:56.378
He doesn't get to have
this family and that.

35:56.446 --> 35:58.714
Oh, Betty.

35:58.782 --> 36:01.083
You have terrible luck with entertaining.

36:09.459 --> 36:10.860
Just be careful.

36:10.927 --> 36:12.895
Don has nothing to lose,

36:12.963 --> 36:14.897
and you have everything.

36:31.648 --> 36:35.184
I don't know if you heard,
but I fired Joey.

36:35.252 --> 36:38.454
I did. Good for you.

36:40.357 --> 36:42.391
Excuse me?

36:42.459 --> 36:44.593
Now everybody in the office will know

36:44.661 --> 36:46.247
that you solved my problem and that you

36:46.248 --> 36:47.630
must be really important, I guess.

36:49.866 --> 36:52.835
What's wrong with you? I defended you.

36:52.903 --> 36:54.870
You defended yourself.

36:54.938 --> 36:56.372
Fine.

36:58.041 --> 37:00.042
That cartoon was disgusting.

37:00.110 --> 37:01.644
I had already handled it

37:01.711 --> 37:03.445
and if I had wanted to go further,

37:03.513 --> 37:06.182
one dinner with Mr. Kreutzer
from Sugarberry ham

37:06.249 --> 37:08.684
and Joey would've been off it
and out of my hair.

37:08.752 --> 37:10.953
So? It's the same result.

37:12.322 --> 37:14.123
You want to be a big shot.

37:14.191 --> 37:17.493
Well, no matter how powerful
we get around here,

37:17.561 --> 37:19.962
they can still just draw a cartoon.

37:20.030 --> 37:21.954
So all you've done is proved to them

37:21.955 --> 37:26.666
that I'm a meaningless secretary
and you're another humorless bitch.

37:29.539 --> 37:32.174
Have a nice weekend. Good night, Peggy.

37:41.084 --> 37:43.018
When a man walks into a room,

37:43.086 --> 37:45.187
he brings his whole life with him.

37:55.632 --> 37:58.133
He has a million reasons
for being anywhere.

37:58.201 --> 37:59.802
Just ask him.

38:04.474 --> 38:07.042
If you listen, he'll tell you
how he got there,

38:12.115 --> 38:14.149
how he forgot where he was going

38:14.217 --> 38:16.352
and then he woke up.

38:18.588 --> 38:21.490
If you listen, he'll tell you

38:21.558 --> 38:23.425
about the time he thought he was an angel

38:25.095 --> 38:26.829
or dreamt of being perfect.

38:30.133 --> 38:32.635
And then he'll smile with wisdom,

38:32.702 --> 38:34.370
content that he'd realized

38:34.437 --> 38:36.472
the world isn't perfect.

38:40.043 --> 38:43.412
We're flawed because we want so much more.

38:59.996 --> 39:01.964
We're ruined

39:02.032 --> 39:03.699
because we get these things

39:03.767 --> 39:05.834
and wish for what we had.

39:18.715 --> 39:21.684
- You smell nice.
- So do you,

39:21.751 --> 39:24.553
like chlorine.

39:24.621 --> 39:27.056
I've been swimming.

39:27.123 --> 39:28.791
Does it feel like summer?

39:28.858 --> 39:31.226
It clears my head.

39:31.294 --> 39:34.530
- For the creative process?
- For something.

39:35.899 --> 39:38.367
I've been a little out of sorts lately.

39:41.104 --> 39:43.072
It's an effort to get in the water,

39:43.139 --> 39:45.474
but when you do you're weightless
and you don't even sweat.

39:46.810 --> 39:48.544
And in the end,

39:48.611 --> 39:50.579
you're wrung out.

39:54.217 --> 39:57.219
I've been looking forward to this.

39:57.287 --> 39:59.488
It's very hard to get a reservation here.

39:59.556 --> 40:04.026
You should've called me. I know a guy.

40:04.094 --> 40:06.028
Really?

40:06.096 --> 40:08.030
Who's your guy?

40:08.098 --> 40:09.798
My father.

40:11.634 --> 40:14.670
A lot of people who supply restaurants

40:14.738 --> 40:16.739
know a lot of the same
people who know my father.

40:19.175 --> 40:20.642
Like...?

40:21.945 --> 40:24.513
Not my father, just his friends.

40:24.581 --> 40:26.315
He owns a candy store

40:28.184 --> 40:30.652
and there are certain responsibilities

40:30.720 --> 40:32.755
that go along with that.

40:32.822 --> 40:34.923
Interesting.

40:36.493 --> 40:37.793
What's he like?

40:39.629 --> 40:42.731
He's a handsome two-bit gangster like you.

40:45.468 --> 40:47.102
Two glasses of chianti.

40:52.776 --> 40:55.944
When I'm out of sorts,
I look at the calendar.

40:56.012 --> 40:59.548
There's usually something
significant on the horizon.

41:01.651 --> 41:03.752
I never noticed that.

41:07.757 --> 41:09.691
It's my two-year-old's birthday,

41:11.261 --> 41:12.761
but I'm not going.

41:14.731 --> 41:16.265
Why not?

41:18.101 --> 41:20.069
Because I'm not welcome there.

41:22.005 --> 41:24.640
He thinks that man's his father.

41:27.877 --> 41:29.244
Maybe that's okay.

41:30.547 --> 41:31.980
All he knows of the world

41:32.048 --> 41:33.482
is what you show him.

41:48.998 --> 41:50.799
Oh, that's nice.

41:59.976 --> 42:02.611
I know I've sometimes
behaved to the contrary,

42:02.679 --> 42:04.580
but I do admire your work.

42:04.647 --> 42:06.915
That's nice to hear.

42:06.983 --> 42:10.252
So tell me a trade secret.

42:11.988 --> 42:13.989
How do you get them to do
what you want them to do?

42:17.627 --> 42:20.329
Aesop has a fable about
the wind and the sun.

42:21.764 --> 42:24.633
The wind and the sun had this competition

42:24.701 --> 42:26.668
to see if they could get
a traveler's coat off.

42:26.736 --> 42:29.938
So the wind blows fiercely on him,

42:30.006 --> 42:33.542
but the traveler just
pulls his coat tighter.

42:33.610 --> 42:36.211
But the sun shines down on him,

42:36.279 --> 42:38.013
warmer and warmer,

42:38.081 --> 42:40.616
and the traveler just

42:40.683 --> 42:42.217
takes it off.

42:43.486 --> 42:45.220
And the moral is?

42:46.856 --> 42:50.225
Kindness, gentleness and persuasion win

42:50.293 --> 42:52.194
where force fails.

42:54.264 --> 42:57.299
You know, Aesop did that
in probably 10 lines.

42:57.367 --> 43:00.202
He's very economical.

43:00.270 --> 43:02.504
So what you're saying is you want my coat.

43:20.990 --> 43:23.225
72nd and Broadway.

43:23.293 --> 43:24.927
Thank you.

43:54.924 --> 43:56.658
Where do you live?

43:56.726 --> 43:58.760
Only around the corner.

43:58.828 --> 44:00.629
Really?

44:02.832 --> 44:04.132
Yes.

44:05.668 --> 44:07.569
But I'm just going
to take you to your door.

44:10.406 --> 44:12.507
And why is that?

44:15.912 --> 44:18.180
Because that's as far as I can go right now

44:19.582 --> 44:20.949
and I'm not ready to say good night.

44:24.320 --> 44:26.054
That's not what I expected.

45:40.897 --> 45:43.231
- Hello, Francine.
- Hello, Don.

45:43.299 --> 45:44.299
Daddy!

45:48.004 --> 45:50.172
What's he doing here?

45:51.341 --> 45:52.574
It's okay.

46:02.819 --> 46:05.220
Here you go. Say hi to daddy.

46:05.288 --> 46:06.888
Happy Birthday.

46:12.762 --> 46:14.629
We have everything.
