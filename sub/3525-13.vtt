You were right. Forensics has signed off
on him. The body can be released.

01:50.535 --> 01:53.200
Why don't you wait
till they fix him up over there?

01:53.300 --> 01:56.800
I promised our mother
I'd see him like we knew him, Jimmy,

01:56.900 --> 01:59.700
before they put on all that pancake and shit.

02:21.200 --> 02:24.800
Your funeral director's car is here.
I'll go down and meet them.

02:31.900 --> 02:34.100
John, how long I gotta wait?

02:34.200 --> 02:36.500
Tony Soprano left to his own device

02:36.600 --> 02:39.600
is never gonna give up
that fuckin' animal Blundetto.

02:40.700 --> 02:42.900
- Philly...
- An eye for an eye?

02:56.600 --> 02:58.200
This is kinda fun.

02:58.300 --> 03:03.100
But, if I was you, I'd dump this job.

03:03.200 --> 03:05.300
I'd go to Italy.

03:08.500 --> 03:11.200
This is no way for a caretaker to live.

03:12.600 --> 03:15.365
Well, a few things have to settle down first.

03:15.400 --> 03:18.100
My cousin'll send the funds
to go through Canada.

03:18.135 --> 03:20.600
Italy. Wow. Nice cousin.

03:31.600 --> 03:34.100
Oh, hey, thanks for that massage.

03:34.200 --> 03:37.000
My toe doesn't hurt hardly at all now.

03:42.500 --> 03:43.700
Watch the windows.

03:47.000 --> 03:48.665
Excuse me.

03:48.700 --> 03:51.365
How ya doing? You're Joanne, right?

03:51.400 --> 03:54.200
- Who are you?
- Well, we're friends of your son's.

03:54.600 --> 03:56.800
My son doesn't live with me.

03:56.900 --> 04:00.100
We're... from Alcoholics Anonymous.

04:00.135 --> 04:01.700
What's your name?

04:01.800 --> 04:03.800
Well, we're anonymous.

04:03.835 --> 04:05.800
I see his car's out front.

04:05.900 --> 04:08.300
He went to California or Vegas, I don't know.

04:08.400 --> 04:11.465
California or Vegas. When did he leave?

04:11.500 --> 04:14.600
- I'm sorry, I have to go to work.
- Where the fuck is he?

04:14.700 --> 04:18.399
- Leave me alone.
- I had a brother your son's age.

04:18.435 --> 04:20.565
Please let go of my hand.

04:20.600 --> 04:22.765
Where the fuck is he, you fuckin' cunt?

04:22.800 --> 04:26.200
I'll take that Discman and I'll ram it up your box.

04:26.235 --> 04:28.200
Philly, please!

04:29.400 --> 04:31.700
It's the guy's mother, Phil.

04:31.735 --> 04:33.200
It's the guy's mother.

04:39.100 --> 04:40.965
Those jocks are juicers.

04:41.000 --> 04:43.800
- They'll do it for the free brew.
- You're still here?

04:43.835 --> 04:46.600
I'm driving to school,
I don't have to leave as early.

04:46.700 --> 04:48.465
He'll bring some cool people.

04:48.500 --> 04:51.065
- What are you doing up?
- Snowblower.

04:51.100 --> 04:54.500
Seems to me you are not
sleeping that well, period.

04:55.800 --> 04:57.200
Look at you.

04:57.300 --> 05:00.400
I told AJ to fix this leak while
I was still at my mother's.

05:04.000 --> 05:05.500
What's going on with him?

05:05.600 --> 05:08.600
Every time I go by the room he's on the bed
on the phone.

05:08.635 --> 05:10.400
I am so sick of nagging him.

05:10.500 --> 05:15.600
And if he thinks he's gonna get into East
Stroudsburg State, he is sadly mistaken.

05:20.500 --> 05:23.700
Look at this kid out there, the gardener's son.

05:23.800 --> 05:27.400
- Can't ask this one to take out the trash.
- Poverty is a great motivator.

05:33.500 --> 05:36.400
- You think we gave AJ too much?
- Then you look at Meadow.

05:36.435 --> 05:38.900
Same house, everything. She's doing great.

05:38.935 --> 05:40.465
She takes after you maybe.

05:40.500 --> 05:42.500
Don't do that. He's my son too.

05:45.600 --> 05:49.200
I got that appointment with his coach today.
Maybe he's got a clue.

05:49.235 --> 05:52.000
- Hello?
- In here, Dad.

05:53.100 --> 05:57.365
Hey, there's my little amaretto cookie.

05:57.400 --> 06:00.100
Clear a place so we can take a look at these.

06:00.135 --> 06:02.000
Only preliminary drawings.

06:02.100 --> 06:04.165
I've got scones if anybody wants.

06:04.200 --> 06:07.000
Take a look at the house
your mother's gonna build!

06:07.035 --> 06:08.765
And Grandpa, of course.

06:08.800 --> 06:14.100
Tony, Ignatz is responsible for those Normandy
chateaux up on Tisch Drive.

06:14.200 --> 06:18.100
Wow, look at that entry. What is that,
like three storeys high?

06:40.100 --> 06:42.400
- T?
- Christopher, hi, it's Carmela.

06:42.435 --> 06:44.365
- Is Adriana there?
- No.

06:44.400 --> 06:47.900
I was just wondering what was going on.
I stopped by Fortunoff's.

06:47.935 --> 06:51.500
She was supposed to get back to them about
her china pattern

06:51.600 --> 06:54.900
and she hasn't returned their calls.
Is everything all right?

06:57.200 --> 06:59.650
- We broke up.
- What?

06:59.685 --> 07:02.100
Why? What happened?

07:02.600 --> 07:04.765
Nothing. She left. Broke my heart.

07:04.800 --> 07:07.400
Moved out a couple of days ago,
I haven't seen her.

07:07.500 --> 07:10.265
Oh, no, that's terrible. Are you all right?

07:10.300 --> 07:13.800
She stiffed me on the club,
never showed up for work.

07:13.835 --> 07:16.300
Oh, my God! Is there anything I can do?

07:18.200 --> 07:20.365
Well, look, I gotta go.

07:20.400 --> 07:22.700
- Somebody's waiting.
- I am devastated.

07:22.735 --> 07:25.000
I want to reach her. Is there a number?

07:25.035 --> 07:27.265
Not that I know of.

07:27.300 --> 07:30.100
Chris, listen, there's other fish in the sea.

07:31.900 --> 07:33.900
I know. Thanks.

07:59.100 --> 08:02.900
Tony Soprano and Vito Spatafore
talking about the bus station project.

08:02.935 --> 08:04.800
Adriana La Cerva. The way we make it

08:04.900 --> 08:07.400
she's either taken off or maybe gotten clipped.

08:07.435 --> 08:10.200
- You hear anything?
- Clipped, why?

08:11.700 --> 08:15.100
- Stepping out on her boyfriend.
- I heard she took off.

08:15.135 --> 08:18.500
- Any idea where?
- How should I know? He's a dope addict!

08:18.535 --> 08:20.700
Did I already give you that?

08:22.100 --> 08:26.000
- If you hear anything let me know.
- Say hello to Ike and the guys.

08:31.600 --> 08:34.600
T's held up. He said to start without him.

08:34.700 --> 08:37.500
- All right?
- Yeah.

08:38.500 --> 08:40.500
What can we say about this guy?

08:40.600 --> 08:43.299
The ancient Romans had a word for it...

08:43.335 --> 08:44.800
Asshole.

08:47.400 --> 08:50.600
In all candour though, we love you, Raymond.

08:57.700 --> 08:59.700
Take that away. He ain't coming.

08:59.800 --> 09:02.150
- Who, Chris?
- South with the geese.

09:02.185 --> 09:04.642
Christopher is the logical sacrifice bunt.

09:04.677 --> 09:07.088
- The dead brother.
- I'm his brother-in-law.

09:07.123 --> 09:09.500
Think New York is really gonna
come after you?

09:09.600 --> 09:11.765
The fuck do I know?

09:11.800 --> 09:14.900
If you're them, you want somebody
close to Tony as possible.

09:15.000 --> 09:17.465
And who knows him better and longer?

09:17.500 --> 09:20.650
Johnny's gonna
put a financial squeeze on all of us.

09:20.685 --> 09:23.800
I'm already getting
fucked with by Johnny's people.

09:23.900 --> 09:26.500
- It's not good.
- All due respect,

09:26.600 --> 09:29.600
I'm willing to die for a good cause.

09:29.635 --> 09:32.600
- But this is bullshit.
- There he is!

09:33.000 --> 09:34.500
Sit down.

09:38.200 --> 09:39.965
What's going on?

09:40.000 --> 09:42.600
Vito misto, how are ya?

09:43.600 --> 09:46.400
- Happy birthday, Ray.
- Thanks for coming, Tone.

09:46.435 --> 09:49.600
I brought these plus... that's a good one.

09:51.600 --> 09:53.965
I serve it at my house. It's from Avellino.

09:54.000 --> 09:58.000
My grandfather said that some
of my ancestors were winemakers.

09:58.035 --> 10:00.500
- What the fuck do I know?
- Thanks, Tone.

10:00.535 --> 10:02.500
That's gonna be a treasure.

10:02.535 --> 10:04.600
Yeah, well, whatever.

10:06.200 --> 10:08.900
Larry!
What the fuck are you doing here?

10:09.000 --> 10:11.550
- You're under house arrest.
- Fuck them.

10:11.585 --> 10:14.065
I ever see that prison doctor, I'm gonna say,

10:14.100 --> 10:17.900
"Did they ever show you these in medical
school? They're called balls. "

10:18.700 --> 10:20.300
Good for you!

10:22.600 --> 10:24.400
Listen, I can't stay.

10:25.000 --> 10:27.450
I got a meeting I gotta go to.

10:27.485 --> 10:29.900
I got something I wanna say.

10:30.900 --> 10:35.400
My cousin Anthony
went into business for himself.

10:35.500 --> 10:37.200
We all know this.

10:37.700 --> 10:39.800
In a way for which there is no excuse.

10:40.900 --> 10:43.200
He's got a problem with rage.

10:44.200 --> 10:48.100
He disappointed me, Anthony, in ways
that I can't even begin to tell you.

10:49.700 --> 10:51.900
And he put us all at risk.

10:51.935 --> 10:53.900
Irregardless,

10:55.000 --> 10:59.000
it's been made clear to me
that if they put their hands on him,

10:59.100 --> 11:01.100
he will not be dealt with quick.

11:02.000 --> 11:04.200
We're talking torture.

11:05.500 --> 11:10.000
For that reason, even if
I knew where my cousin was and I do not,

11:10.035 --> 11:11.900
I would not deliver him up to them.

11:13.300 --> 11:15.365
I am offering him the same protection

11:15.400 --> 11:19.700
that I would offer any of you
in similar circumstances.

11:19.800 --> 11:23.300
I know what you're gonna say.
"Hey, I would never do what he did. "

11:23.400 --> 11:26.200
God bless, I hope not. But we are a family.

11:27.400 --> 11:31.100
And even in this fucked-up day
and age that means something.

11:31.200 --> 11:34.200
So we are gonna deal
with this as a family, together.

11:34.300 --> 11:36.100
No matter how it affects anybody

11:36.200 --> 11:40.100
personal safety-wise,
financially-wise, whatever.

11:46.400 --> 11:50.500
I see that my nephew isn't here
and it's important he lam it now.

11:50.600 --> 11:54.100
It's my desire that you circle
the wagons, you support him.

11:56.500 --> 11:59.000
Until and as such...

12:09.000 --> 12:11.900
Raymond. I'm sorry I can't stay.

12:13.000 --> 12:14.900
Happy birthday, huh?

12:15.000 --> 12:17.900
- Thanks.
- Gentlemen, enjoy your dinner.

12:18.000 --> 12:19.500
See ya, T.

12:25.800 --> 12:28.300
Thank you. That was great.

12:32.200 --> 12:35.500
- Thought you had Raymond's birthday dinner.
- I left early.

12:35.600 --> 12:37.600
It's nice you're home.

12:38.900 --> 12:41.000
There's chicken parm.

12:43.300 --> 12:45.700
Was Christopher there?

12:48.400 --> 12:49.465
No.

12:49.500 --> 12:52.000
Did you know that him and Adriana broke up?

12:53.000 --> 12:54.800
This kid, that's his trouble.

12:54.900 --> 12:57.165
He keeps it all bottled up.

12:57.200 --> 13:00.300
Then they wonder why they
get chemical dependencies.

13:11.100 --> 13:13.800
Do you think there was somebody else?

13:15.100 --> 13:19.200
There was this one night, it was way back,
movie night with the girls.

13:19.235 --> 13:22.517
Adriana was upset and wanted to get
something off her chest.

13:22.552 --> 13:25.800
Then she ran out crying.
I'll bet she was seeing somebody.

13:28.000 --> 13:30.200
You never know about people.

13:31.800 --> 13:33.865
His plans were often startling,

13:33.900 --> 13:38.000
instinctive, spontaneous,
and not infrequently, obscure.

13:39.100 --> 13:42.800
His men idolised him
and had boundless faith in him.

13:44.400 --> 13:49.200
After being promoted in 1916,
he joyfully returned home on leave

13:49.235 --> 13:51.900
to marry his sweetheart, Lucie Maria Mollin.

13:53.900 --> 13:57.250
She would be the love of his life to its end.

13:57.285 --> 14:00.600
Rommel saw the huge assault on France
forming,

14:00.635 --> 14:03.617
and he saw that a new armoured weapon...

14:03.652 --> 14:06.600
I still love this old house so much.

14:07.500 --> 14:10.800
I should do half so good with my stupid project.

14:12.000 --> 14:16.200
...almost precisely what he had done
as a lieutenant during WWI.

14:19.000 --> 14:21.500
I'm sorry, did you wanna be alone?

14:21.535 --> 14:23.665
No.

14:23.700 --> 14:26.000
...blitzkrieg in its truest form.

14:27.000 --> 14:28.400
It was Rommel...

14:51.300 --> 14:55.600
He had what the Germans call
Fingerspitzengefühl,

14:56.500 --> 15:02.000
which is a sixth sense of sizing up a
situation.

15:23.700 --> 15:26.750
- Claude Rains.
- Thanks for doing this.

15:26.785 --> 15:29.800
About 1500 there. Should tide you over.

15:29.835 --> 15:31.700
- Hey, Sil.
- Hey, kid.

15:31.800 --> 15:33.800
You want something? Fries?

15:34.800 --> 15:38.100
- It's fuckin' something, this situation.
- Right.

15:38.200 --> 15:41.000
I can't even get down
to Milt's, fence some jewellery.

15:41.035 --> 15:43.800
Everybody with eyes in the back of their head.

15:43.900 --> 15:46.200
- I was Tony's driver.
- It's amazing.

15:46.235 --> 15:48.065
You want me to be honest?

15:48.100 --> 15:52.600
The favouritism Tony still shows for our fuckin'
cousin, after what he's done?

15:52.635 --> 15:54.900
What does Tony B have on this guy?

15:55.000 --> 15:57.400
I might take a bullet for this skeeve.

15:57.435 --> 15:59.800
After all your uncle's done for you?

15:59.835 --> 16:01.700
I need to get into specifics?

16:17.300 --> 16:19.300
You said you went home.

16:23.400 --> 16:26.800
Just heard her old man died. I'll give her a call.

16:36.300 --> 16:39.400
Actually, I've been hanging around on purpose.

16:39.435 --> 16:41.300
I gotta talk to you, Tone.

16:42.300 --> 16:44.200
About what?

16:46.000 --> 16:50.100
- I've been your consigliere for years.
- Don't go into a fuckin' preamble.

16:50.135 --> 16:54.200
- Tell me what's on your mind.
- You got some unhappy people out there.

16:54.235 --> 16:57.265
- No shit.
- Not just the young guys.

16:57.300 --> 16:59.865
Guys that've been
with you since the beginning.

16:59.900 --> 17:02.900
Before the beginning.
Guys who worked for your father.

17:03.000 --> 17:05.599
- Fuckin' Paulie, right?
- I'm not saying nothing.

17:05.700 --> 17:07.200
Goddamn him.

17:07.300 --> 17:09.800
These guys, would do whatever you ordered.

17:12.200 --> 17:15.900
- Except in this case.
- Don't say it like that.

17:16.000 --> 17:18.464
Forget that Tony Blundetto's my cousin.

17:18.500 --> 17:21.200
I give him up, we can give
the whole fuckin' thing up.

17:21.800 --> 17:24.700
Here's where the conversation gets difficult.

17:24.734 --> 17:27.000
- Go.
- All due respect.

17:28.400 --> 17:31.100
You were ready to hand him your cousin
a week ago.

17:31.200 --> 17:36.100
It's not about standing with the guys
or upholding some rules. Not really.

17:36.135 --> 17:37.700
Then what's it all about?

17:37.800 --> 17:39.365
Why don't you illuminate me?

17:39.400 --> 17:43.200
It's about you don't wanna eat shit from John.

17:43.235 --> 17:44.800
You don't wanna bow down.

17:44.900 --> 17:47.100
You told him to go fuck himself.

17:47.200 --> 17:48.965
Which, to be honest,

17:49.000 --> 17:51.600
wasn't exactly appropriate, considering.

17:51.700 --> 17:53.865
- Oh, is that right?
- All due respect.

17:53.900 --> 17:56.700
What the fuck do you know
what goes on in my head?

17:56.735 --> 17:58.765
I've known you since you were a kid.

17:58.800 --> 18:03.000
Frankly, you got a problem with authority.

18:06.700 --> 18:08.665
This attitude of yours,

18:08.700 --> 18:11.600
it's a lot of what's made you an effective leader.

18:11.635 --> 18:15.465
But we all got flaws. Even you.

18:15.500 --> 18:18.800
Seven deadly sins and yours is pride.

18:25.700 --> 18:30.700
All due respect. You got no fuckin' idea
what it's like to be number one.

18:30.800 --> 18:35.600
Every decision you make affects every facet of
every other fuckin' thing.

18:35.635 --> 18:37.965
It's too much to deal with almost.

18:38.000 --> 18:41.200
And in the end,
you're completely alone with it all.

18:46.700 --> 18:48.700
I'm sorry you feel that way.

18:48.800 --> 18:51.365
This is the course I've chosen,

18:51.400 --> 18:55.300
and those of you that are not with me on it,
well, that makes me sad.

18:55.400 --> 18:57.200
And it'll be dealt with in time.

19:14.800 --> 19:16.900
You need me for anything else?

20:09.400 --> 20:11.800
- Benny, right?
- How ya doing, Mr Leotardo?

20:11.900 --> 20:16.300
I'm sitting listening to WFAN and I go,
isn't that the kid that used to drive for Tony?

20:16.400 --> 20:19.600
- I'm on my way to the hospital.
- Well, that's up to you.

20:19.635 --> 20:21.600
No, I mean my mom, she...

20:21.700 --> 20:23.800
- Where's his friend?
- What friend?

20:23.835 --> 20:25.500
Don't fuck with me, kid!

20:25.535 --> 20:27.100
Don't fuck with me!

20:40.500 --> 20:43.500
- Where's Blundetto?
- I don't know!

20:49.900 --> 20:51.900
It's a start.

21:12.300 --> 21:16.000
- Jesus.
- He has a fractured skull.

21:20.300 --> 21:23.600
- Is he talking at all?
- A little.

21:31.200 --> 21:33.900
Listen, Ben, I want you to know that...

21:35.000 --> 21:38.500
...it'll be taken care of through
the plumber's union health plan.

21:43.800 --> 21:46.100
You know what? We were talking here.

21:46.200 --> 21:48.665
It's time for you to get your own customers.

21:48.700 --> 21:51.700
You're getting a little too old
to be beating people up.

21:58.300 --> 22:00.300
- Where's Larry?
- He's staying home.

22:00.400 --> 22:02.465
He's the boy's godfather. He called me.

22:02.500 --> 22:06.100
- Said he was gonna be with the kid.
- House arrest.

22:11.000 --> 22:13.000
All right.

22:19.900 --> 22:23.265
- This is fucked up.
- What do ya wanna do about it?

22:23.300 --> 22:26.800
What do I wanna do? I want that man there
to do something about it.

22:26.900 --> 22:29.200
I want him to give us the OK
to go to Brooklyn,

22:29.235 --> 22:31.365
clean some timepieces over there.

22:31.400 --> 22:34.865
Tony Blundetto whacked
the brother of a captain.

22:34.900 --> 22:38.400
If Tony tried to strike at them again,
we should take him out.

22:44.500 --> 22:47.700
Look, just give me that first one,
the Oregonian.

22:47.735 --> 22:50.500
$39.95.

22:52.900 --> 22:55.100
You're sending a fruit basket to the kid.

22:55.200 --> 22:57.400
- He'll appreciate it.
- It's for Mel.

22:57.435 --> 22:59.365
The poor guy had a stroke.

22:59.400 --> 23:02.800
- He's younger than me.
- Melvoin?

23:02.835 --> 23:04.600
Jesus Christ, that's terrible.

23:04.700 --> 23:08.200
That's why I asked you to come over.
His speech...

23:08.235 --> 23:11.700
He'll sound a little suonato,
probably forever.

23:11.735 --> 23:15.500
But get this, nine months, maybe a year,

23:15.535 --> 23:18.267
till he can work a full schedule.

23:18.302 --> 23:21.000
They'll have to postpone my retrial.

23:21.100 --> 23:23.165
No shit?

23:23.200 --> 23:28.100
The question is, should I use the stall,
but then get a lawyer who's more with it?

23:31.000 --> 23:33.600
You heard about this thing with Phil and John?

23:35.500 --> 23:39.500
- Bobby said something about this.
- That you're losing money, probably.

23:39.535 --> 23:43.000
- I am? How much?
- I don't know, you gotta talk to him.

23:45.000 --> 23:46.700
Does John do your collections?

23:53.500 --> 23:56.400
Look, Uncle Jun', what do you think?

23:56.500 --> 23:59.200
Phil beat one of my guys
to within an inch of his life.

23:59.235 --> 24:01.717
Next time he'll kill somebody.

24:01.752 --> 24:04.200
What can I do? It's my cousin.

24:07.800 --> 24:10.400
Did I give them
the office address or the home?

24:14.100 --> 24:16.065
- I'm talking to you.
- He had a stroke.

24:16.100 --> 24:19.600
You want it to go to the wrong place?
It's fruit, it'll rot.

24:20.500 --> 24:24.200
I pinned myself into a corner here,
and I don't see a way out.

24:24.300 --> 24:26.850
But he wasn't made, right?

24:26.885 --> 24:29.400
The kid... Phil's son.

24:35.200 --> 24:37.200
It's OK, forget it.

24:38.400 --> 24:41.200
I'm sorry.
I'm fuckin' nonplussed with all this news.

24:41.235 --> 24:43.400
Frankly, I don't know.

24:43.500 --> 24:46.100
You're going a little squirrelly in this house.

24:46.200 --> 24:49.400
- Tell Phil.
- Tell Phil what?

24:54.900 --> 24:57.000
Where you going?

24:58.200 --> 25:02.500
- You wanted to confer with me?
- Nah, it's not important.

25:06.000 --> 25:08.700
Make sure you eat a lunch today.

25:24.100 --> 25:25.700
Poor fuckin' Feech La Manna.

25:25.800 --> 25:28.265
Tony sent the wrong ex-con back to jail.

25:28.300 --> 25:33.500
You realise I had an entire container of
imported provolone coming in Saturday?

25:33.535 --> 25:35.765
And fuckin' Phil and them put it on a truck,

25:35.800 --> 25:39.500
took it to Westchester instead of Rahway
where we always split the loads.

25:39.535 --> 25:41.767
Jesus. That shit is liquid gold.

25:41.802 --> 25:43.965
Tony knows what has to be done.

25:44.000 --> 25:46.900
Tell John where to find Blundetto.
He just won't do it.

25:47.000 --> 25:48.900
As if he even knows where Tony B is.

25:49.000 --> 25:51.500
Give me a fuckin' break. Of course he knows.

25:51.535 --> 25:53.965
- It's Christopher I feel for.
- Please!

25:54.000 --> 25:56.800
Let me tell ya something.
Soprano is very adroit

25:56.900 --> 25:59.500
at keeping his family outta the frying pan.

25:59.535 --> 26:01.800
Both cousins. The rest of us...

26:03.600 --> 26:06.600
How's life now that you're back home?

26:14.500 --> 26:17.200
I had a dream a couple of weeks ago.

26:18.200 --> 26:21.000
Before I moved back, a recurring dream.

26:21.035 --> 26:23.800
I see my old coach from high school.

26:23.835 --> 26:26.000
What happens?

26:30.000 --> 26:33.500
He told me back then, this guy, he said...

26:36.100 --> 26:39.600
- he said that I was special.
- You never told me this.

26:39.700 --> 26:41.365
Why now?

26:41.400 --> 26:44.900
Does everything
I drag in here gotta be a dead dog?

26:46.600 --> 26:49.000
I went to see my son's football coach.

26:50.200 --> 26:56.300
See, he was starting my boy and now...
the coach is going to this other kid more.

26:56.335 --> 26:58.465
What's the reason?

26:58.500 --> 27:01.400
Well, AJ's just devoting
more energy to academics.

27:01.435 --> 27:04.000
He's determined to get into a good school.

27:07.700 --> 27:11.100
How's things on other fronts?

27:11.135 --> 27:13.200
Your cousin?

27:15.700 --> 27:19.700
Well, you touched
on something there that's not so good.

27:19.800 --> 27:23.200
- What's the problem?
- I really can't talk to you about it.

27:23.300 --> 27:26.350
This is very difficult for me, treating you,

27:26.385 --> 27:29.400
when so much of your life is closed off.

27:29.435 --> 27:31.100
How many times can I say this?

27:31.200 --> 27:33.400
Look, I'm not trying to be difficult here.

27:33.500 --> 27:35.665
It's just that it affects me tremendously,

27:35.700 --> 27:39.100
this trouble he's gotten himself into,
so I'm upset!

27:39.135 --> 27:41.000
Well...

27:42.100 --> 27:45.900
- And I care about him so much.
- You care about him so much?

27:45.935 --> 27:49.200
We spent hours getting to the realisation

27:49.300 --> 27:53.500
that your feelings for your cousin stem
from guilt and shame.

27:53.535 --> 27:56.200
Do you remember that? Do you care?

27:56.300 --> 27:58.400
It's just that it doesn't matter now...

27:58.500 --> 28:02.900
It's just that here we are, as always,
back at square one,

28:02.935 --> 28:06.167
with you going into high-sentimentality mode.

28:06.202 --> 28:09.400
Sentimentality mode?
We were children together!

28:10.100 --> 28:13.100
Look, it's a lot like with your son.

28:13.200 --> 28:15.865
Here's what I bet the coach didn't tell you.

28:15.900 --> 28:22.100
What you wanted to hear most
is that your son is special too.

28:25.000 --> 28:28.200
What I'm saying is, whatever you wanna do,

28:28.300 --> 28:33.600
vis-à-vis your cousin, your son, whoever,
own your feelings!

28:37.700 --> 28:42.500
- I'm very confused.
- But... we can't talk about it.

28:44.700 --> 28:46.300
It's my mess.

28:49.700 --> 28:52.600
All my choices were wrong.

28:56.100 --> 28:58.500
- How much?
- It's five bucks.

29:03.700 --> 29:05.500
Your cup's your admission pass.

29:11.500 --> 29:15.200
- Where are they from?
- Montville.

29:15.300 --> 29:16.900
They gotta go.

29:16.935 --> 29:19.365
Totally.

29:19.400 --> 29:21.365
- Hello?
- Chiara!

29:21.400 --> 29:24.100
No, you gotta come up Greenbrook Road.

29:26.100 --> 29:29.000
Patrick said to tell you some people have
bogus cups.

29:29.035 --> 29:31.900
They brought them with them
to get out of paying.

29:36.000 --> 29:39.500
- Hey, man, let me see your cup.
- It's in the Athletic Department.

29:39.600 --> 29:42.700
We're getting ripped off.
This isn't downloading music.

29:42.735 --> 29:45.500
That beer is our property unless you pay for it.

29:47.100 --> 29:49.000
Fucking manners!

30:33.000 --> 30:34.800
Speak.

30:37.200 --> 30:38.700
Hello.

31:04.000 --> 31:06.600
- Who is it?
- Open this door!

31:10.300 --> 31:12.465
I wanna talk to you.

31:12.500 --> 31:14.800
I hear you got some beefs.

31:17.100 --> 31:19.400
Do you wanna phone everybody?

31:26.300 --> 31:28.800
What the fuck?

31:28.900 --> 31:34.100
I know you said you wanted it burnt, T,
but the picture moved me.

31:35.000 --> 31:37.400
Cos you knew it cost me an arm and a leg.

31:37.435 --> 31:39.800
It's museum-quality work, I admit that.

31:39.900 --> 31:43.000
But I told the guys a chance to hang
a picture of you on my wall?

31:43.035 --> 31:44.900
I rescued it from the flames.

31:45.000 --> 31:46.700
What's with the hat and shit?

31:47.100 --> 31:50.500
Don't give me "huh".
You know what it does to me?

31:50.600 --> 31:54.300
- To be reminded of that fuckin' horse?
- I'm sorry, T.

31:54.400 --> 31:58.400
But you never come here no more.
I didn't figure there'd be a problem.

32:03.800 --> 32:07.700
I never come here no more
cos they're watching all our houses.

32:07.735 --> 32:10.800
- It's no good for us to visit.
- I know.

32:16.300 --> 32:18.500
Do you and your whores get a big laugh?

32:18.600 --> 32:20.800
- That's no joke.
- Then what is it?

32:20.900 --> 32:24.400
That's no joke! That cost me a lotta
money to get the retouching done.

32:24.435 --> 32:28.100
What the fuck did you do it for?
And don't bullshit me, Paulie.

32:28.135 --> 32:32.000
Part of it was to fix some fire damage
on the guy's feet.

32:32.035 --> 32:34.317
But while I was at it, I also thought,

32:34.352 --> 32:36.600
I don't have a modern look in here,

32:36.700 --> 32:40.065
so go with something more traditional,

32:40.100 --> 32:42.465
that catches more of what you're all about.

32:42.500 --> 32:46.300
- A goddamn lawn jockey?
- That's not a lawn jockey.

32:46.335 --> 32:48.100
That's a general.

32:49.900 --> 32:51.700
What general? Who?

32:51.800 --> 32:55.600
It's not a real general from history, it's you.

33:09.400 --> 33:11.400
What the fuck.

36:03.100 --> 36:04.300
Speak.

36:05.400 --> 36:09.300
He's at 146, Route 9A, Kinderhook.

36:56.000 --> 36:58.200
- Skip.
- How's it going?

37:09.900 --> 37:12.000
We got you your bialys and coffee.

37:17.600 --> 37:21.100
Johnny Sack called for you.
Called a couple of times.

37:21.135 --> 37:23.300
He seemed upset about something.

37:35.400 --> 37:38.900
- Good bialy.
- Any time, boss.

38:00.600 --> 38:02.700
Catch ya later.

38:07.000 --> 38:09.200
Take it easy, Tone.

38:22.600 --> 38:25.050
- What?
- It didn't solve a thing.

38:25.085 --> 38:27.465
- It's over, John.
- The fuck it is!

38:27.500 --> 38:30.765
- He's beside himself now.
- The best thing for him,

38:30.800 --> 38:36.000
for you, for all of us, is to put this thing behind
us and get back to business.

38:37.100 --> 38:41.000
- How is that supposed to happen?
- It's something we gotta talk about.

38:41.100 --> 38:43.500
As a first step, I'd consider giving Phil

38:43.600 --> 38:47.900
a quarter of my points in the Bloomfield
operation, which my cousin was running.

38:50.300 --> 38:53.000
I'm at Columbia Pres all day,
my yearly physical.

38:53.100 --> 38:55.665
An hour already, I'm waiting for this doctor.

38:55.700 --> 38:59.500
Then I got bone density tests, lipids.
Come into the city tonight.

38:59.600 --> 39:03.300
No offence, John, but I got
an IQ of 136. It's been tested.

39:06.700 --> 39:09.400
All right. Tomorrow morning then,
my house, 6:30.

39:09.435 --> 39:12.100
- What?
- I'm on a 9.00 a. m. flight to Miami.

39:12.200 --> 39:15.065
I have to get things in line there.

39:15.100 --> 39:18.700
You think I'm gonna give you
ammazzo with Ginny upstairs?

39:22.800 --> 39:26.900
- If you don't hear from me, I'll be there.
- Tony, you and you alone.

39:26.935 --> 39:29.400
I'm not having Phil, nobody.

39:35.600 --> 39:38.800
- Who is it?
- It's me.

39:59.100 --> 40:02.400
You need to go up to the farm
and pick up your cousin.

40:05.100 --> 40:07.800
I need you to go up there now, this morning.

40:07.835 --> 40:10.600
It may be over, but watch your back.

40:12.700 --> 40:15.200
Take him off the premises, obviously.

40:17.000 --> 40:19.300
He should be buried.

40:20.400 --> 40:23.300
It should be you that does it.

40:23.335 --> 40:25.400
You got it.

40:30.900 --> 40:35.300
We never got
a chance to talk in detail about Adriana.

40:36.300 --> 40:37.900
I know.

40:51.300 --> 40:53.100
If you let something slip,

40:54.400 --> 40:56.300
if she saw anything...

40:57.600 --> 41:01.200
There was a couple of times
I had her with me picking up collections.

41:01.300 --> 41:03.100
Esplanade.

41:05.500 --> 41:08.300
The cigarettes...
she was always nosing around.

41:11.900 --> 41:15.100
Did you ever say anything
about Ralph or the Bevelaqua kid?

41:15.135 --> 41:16.700
- No.
- Would you remember?

41:16.735 --> 41:18.400
I swear on my life.

41:35.000 --> 41:39.500
- You won't find any of that.
- I'm reading, I'm lifting weights.

41:41.700 --> 41:45.700
I know what you think but you'll see.
I'm gonna prove myself to you.

41:45.735 --> 41:48.700
I only chipped that once, on the day with her.

41:58.200 --> 42:02.100
She was willing to rat me out
because she couldn't do five fuckin' years?

42:02.135 --> 42:04.500
- I thought she loved me.
- She's a cunt.

42:06.300 --> 42:09.100
Does no good to think about that now.

42:14.500 --> 42:16.100
All right.

42:36.200 --> 42:38.200
He does like her.

42:38.300 --> 42:40.100
Cos he told me.

42:43.600 --> 42:46.600
- I have heard you talking all night.
- Could you knock?

42:46.635 --> 42:49.065
You said you'd finish your application.

42:49.100 --> 42:52.800
You're gonna stroke out if you
can't find a way to control yourself.

42:52.900 --> 42:55.500
- I know.
- Hang that phone up.

42:57.600 --> 42:59.500
Call me back later?

43:01.100 --> 43:03.665
I don't know what to say, you know?

43:03.700 --> 43:06.900
If applications are late,
you are cooked. It's that simple.

43:06.935 --> 43:09.600
I know this because I have
raised you from day one,

43:09.635 --> 43:11.665
you won't like working at McDonald's.

43:11.700 --> 43:14.365
- Could you up the drama a little?
- You know what?

43:14.400 --> 43:17.600
I don't like the sarcasm,
and I don't want you around here

43:17.700 --> 43:19.765
next year sponging off of us, so fine.

43:19.800 --> 43:22.700
No allowance
until those applications are done.

43:22.735 --> 43:25.500
That's not even practical and you know it.

43:25.600 --> 43:28.900
- What's the matter?
- He hasn't done his applications.

43:28.935 --> 43:31.500
- He isn't getting allowance.
- No allowance.

43:31.600 --> 43:34.300
- I have $300 of my own money.
- How?

43:34.335 --> 43:36.365
Me and Matt put on a party.

43:36.400 --> 43:40.600
$5 a person. We made 600 bucks
after expenses.

43:40.700 --> 43:42.565
- What expenses?
- The band.

43:42.600 --> 43:45.565
Is that why you've been on the phone
for two weeks?

43:45.600 --> 43:49.900
It may interest you to know
people said it was the best party all year.

43:49.935 --> 43:53.400
- There was drinking?
- We just let people into Matt's house.

43:53.435 --> 43:57.100
What they brought with them
was not under our control.

43:57.200 --> 43:59.900
Do your applications. Now.

44:12.400 --> 44:15.400
- What?
- You know, it's interesting.

44:15.500 --> 44:18.300
I was talking to his college advisor...

44:18.400 --> 44:19.665
Who, Wegler?

44:19.700 --> 44:23.100
No, AJ got switched around. Miss Merrow.

44:23.135 --> 44:26.465
She mentioned that AJ talked to her once

44:26.500 --> 44:30.500
about what might be good schools
to study event planning.

44:32.000 --> 44:34.100
Event planning?

44:38.300 --> 44:40.850
What the hell is it?

44:40.885 --> 44:43.400
I am not really sure.

44:47.000 --> 44:50.365
- Gay, isn't it?
- I don't know.

44:50.400 --> 44:53.000
I know you're around a lot of wealthy people.

44:54.600 --> 44:57.200
He watches that DVD over and over again.

44:57.300 --> 45:00.100
The one with Mike Myers about...
What's his name?

45:00.200 --> 45:04.200
- Steve Rubell, the Studio 54 guy?
- Oh, Jesus.

45:11.300 --> 45:13.100
Yeah, but I mean, you know, it...

45:18.000 --> 45:20.400
Well, I guess, you know...

45:21.300 --> 45:24.500
I don't know.

45:24.600 --> 45:26.900
He's fired up about something at least.

46:03.700 --> 46:05.400
So? Go ahead.

46:07.000 --> 46:11.100
Phil has to know that punishment has been
meted out and that's all there is.

46:11.135 --> 46:13.700
And that what we are here for, in the end,

46:13.800 --> 46:20.500
is to put food on the table for our families,
our sons, the future.

46:20.600 --> 46:24.000
- That's what's important.
- He doesn't accept that.

46:24.035 --> 46:25.865
His family's smaller by one.

46:25.900 --> 46:29.100
Well, then, my friend,
it's up to you to make him accept it.

46:29.200 --> 46:31.065
- Me?
- Let's talk, John,

46:31.100 --> 46:33.865
about the 500-pound elephant in the room.

46:33.900 --> 46:38.400
You started this cycle of bloodshed when you
whacked the girl Carmine used to fuck.

46:38.435 --> 46:40.500
Lorraine Calluzzo was not a girl,

46:40.600 --> 46:43.400
and what kind of a man
bangs his second cousin?

46:43.500 --> 46:45.800
What are you, the frigging cardinal?

46:47.700 --> 46:50.365
You wanna shut down
our joint construction jobs?

46:50.400 --> 46:54.365
Eat K-rations? Fine. You want Phil
to put one in one of my guys?

46:54.400 --> 46:58.500
That's gonna go a long way to making you
the rich prick that you want to be.

46:58.535 --> 47:01.967
- What do you suggest?
- Whatever his legitimate sorrow,

47:02.002 --> 47:05.400
he's got a price.
He wants to provide for his family.

47:06.200 --> 47:08.265
- And?
- And what?

47:08.300 --> 47:10.565
Meet his price, and that's it.

47:10.600 --> 47:13.400
- I don't wanna hear nothing else.
- Oh, you don't?

47:13.435 --> 47:17.300
I've paid enough, John. I've paid a lot.

47:28.700 --> 47:30.600
Maybe I could sell it.

47:31.500 --> 47:34.700
Truth is we've had discussions.
I gave him the sports book.

47:34.800 --> 47:37.200
Why didn't you say that, you cheap fuck?

47:37.300 --> 47:40.200
Cos I don't like it.
He's gonna want consigliere or...

47:40.300 --> 47:42.900
Let's not go backwards now.

47:48.700 --> 47:51.465
These people you run into
who wanna be boss, huh?

47:51.500 --> 47:55.500
- They should know.
- I told you. You don't listen, you nut.

47:59.700 --> 48:02.700
It's good... seeing you again.

48:03.800 --> 48:06.800
I still look forward
to working with you, John. I mean that.

48:06.900 --> 48:09.700
- You want a coffee?
- Oh, I don't know.

48:15.200 --> 48:17.400
Fuckin' Christ!

48:34.700 --> 48:36.500
FBI, open up!

48:41.200 --> 48:42.900
Oh, my God!

48:52.700 --> 48:54.700
I'm the gardener.

50:02.600 --> 50:04.200
Absolutely, put him on.

50:06.200 --> 50:10.400
The Feds just hit Johnny Sack.
You heard anything?

50:10.500 --> 50:13.300
I had Gendler on my cell phone
all the way over here.

50:13.335 --> 50:15.265
Jimmy Petrille was a collaborator.

50:15.300 --> 50:18.500
They took down
the whole Petrille crew plus Johnny.

50:18.600 --> 50:21.500
Would've reached Carmine Senior
if he hadn't died.

50:21.535 --> 50:24.600
Jimmy Petrille? He's a sweet old guy.

50:24.700 --> 50:27.500
He gave them gambling,
homicides, trafficking...

50:27.535 --> 50:29.165
18 fuckin' years' worth.

50:29.200 --> 50:31.300
It's a major kreplach, my friend.

50:31.400 --> 50:34.050
- I was fuckin' there.
- What, where?

50:34.085 --> 50:36.542
Johnny's house. My car's in the driveway.

50:36.577 --> 50:38.965
I'm walking three miles towards my house.

50:39.000 --> 50:42.700
No law against parking your car
unless it's in front of a hydrant.

50:43.500 --> 50:46.500
- I'm not laughing, Neil.
- No, of course not.

50:47.700 --> 50:51.400
Anyway, you weren't named
in the indictment, obviously.

50:51.435 --> 50:53.865
It's Brooklyn. They weren't coming for you.

50:53.900 --> 50:58.300
So frankly, were I you,
I might actually consider laughing.

50:58.400 --> 51:01.000
Or rub a hunchback's hump. Or something.

51:03.900 --> 51:06.400
- Yeah.
- Be of good cheer.

51:07.300 --> 51:09.200
Call you when I hear more.

52:50.800 --> 52:54.400
What happened to you?
And your shoes are soaking wet.

55:06.800 --> 55:07.800
English

55:08.305 --> 55:14.629
