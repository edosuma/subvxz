ALL OVER THE SPORTS SECTION
COUPLE MONTHS AGO.

05:34.200 --> 05:36.133
GOT FIRED AS THE DOCTOR
FOR THE COUGARS.

05:36.133 --> 05:38.567
HE MUST HAVE LANDED
ON HIS FEET.

05:38.567 --> 05:41.400

05:41.400 --> 05:44.534

05:44.534 --> 05:46.834
WHAT'S THE TIMELINE?

05:46.834 --> 05:48.200
HE DID HIS ROUNDS
AT LENOX HILL,

05:48.200 --> 05:50.100
THEN HE CAUGHT THE 11:00
SERVICES AT ST. EDGAR'S.

05:50.100 --> 05:53.000
GOT HOME BY 12:40, 12:45.

05:53.000 --> 05:55.767
THERE'S ANOTHER BLOODY
FOOTPRINT HERE.

05:55.767 --> 05:58.634
THE KILLER WORE BOOTS.

05:58.634 --> 06:04.300
 <i>THE TREAD LOOKS LIKE</i>
 <i>MOTORCYCLE BOOTS.</i>

06:04.300 --> 06:06.701

06:06.701 --> 06:10.133

BUT I-I COULDN'T.

06:10.133 --> 06:12.367
CAN YOU DESCRIBE HIM?

06:12.367 --> 06:14.667
UH, HE WAS WEARING
A SKI MASK,

06:14.667 --> 06:17.968
BUT HE WAS, UH, TALL,
MAYBE SIX FEET.

06:17.968 --> 06:19.934
ANYTHING ELSE?

06:19.934 --> 06:23.734
HIS EYES.

06:23.734 --> 06:26.734
I WAS LOOKING RIGHT
INTO THEM WHEN HE HIT ME,

06:26.734 --> 06:31.334
AND I THOUGHT
HE WAS GONNA KILL ME.

06:31.334 --> 06:34.434
THEY WERE BLUE-GRAY.

06:37.734 --> 06:40.300
YOU WERE EXPECTING SOMEONE?

06:40.300 --> 06:42.267
NO.

06:44.567 --> 06:47.801
NO, I WAS ALONE
ALL MORNING.

CHECK YOU AT THE HOSPITAL.

A MATINEE WITH THE DOCTOR

07:03.400 --> 07:07.801
OR SHE WAS ENTERTAINING,
AS MY MOM WOULD SAY.

07:07.801 --> 07:11.267
CHECK THE BEDDING

ADDICTED TO PAINKILLERS."

DISHING THE DIRT THESE DAYS.

WHAT'S THE OTHER ONE?

07:25.167 --> 07:26.200
THE GUY GETS FIRED,

07:26.200 --> 07:28.501
MAYBE HE'S SUPPLEMENTING
HIS INCOME.

07:30.400 --> 07:33.167
YOU LOOK RESTED.
HOPE YOU HAD A GOOD TIME.

07:33.167 --> 07:34.667
WHAT HAVE YOU GOT?

07:34.667 --> 07:37.634
WE HAVE A MURDER STAGED
TO LOOK LIKE A HOME INVASION.

07:37.634 --> 07:38.801
THAT'S FRESH.

07:38.801 --> 07:41.300
THE KILLER TOOK SOME
RARE COINS AND JEWELRY.

07:41.300 --> 07:43.634
THE CANVASS FOUND THEM
IN A DRAIN NEAR THE HOUSE.

07:43.634 --> 07:45.167
WE'RE LOOKING AT THIS.

07:45.167 --> 07:47.868
IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN
A PAYBACK KILLING.

07:47.868 --> 07:49.167
THE VICTIM

07:49.167 --> 07:51.968
HAD THAT AND
THE NUMBER OF <i>THE LEDGER</i>

07:51.968 --> 07:53.100
 <i>ON HIS SPEED DIAL.</i>

07:53.100 --> 07:55.400
DR. CONLON WAS,
UNTIL RECENTLY,

07:55.400 --> 07:57.234
A TEAM DOCTOR
FOR THE COUGARS.

07:57.234 --> 07:59.400
CLEON LEWIS WAS
THEIR STAR RUNNING BACK.

07:59.400 --> 08:02.267
 <i>THE LEDGER'S</i> NOT ADMITTING
ANYTHING, BUT WE THINK

08:02.267 --> 08:06.534
THEY MIGHT HAVE BOUGHT
THE MEDICAL RECORDS FROM CONLON.

08:06.534 --> 08:08.534
WHAT ABOUT LEADS
FROM THE CANVASS?

08:08.534 --> 08:10.901
A WOMAN
TAKING OUT THE TRASH

08:10.901 --> 08:12.534
SAW SOMEONE
PEEL OUT OF THE ALLEY

08:12.534 --> 08:15.267
ON A BLACK MOTORCYCLE,
BLACK HELMET, GLOVES.

08:15.267 --> 08:17.934
GREAT. BATMAN.

08:17.934 --> 08:22.200
ACTUALLY, BATMAN
WAS A VIGILANTE, SIR.

08:24.834 --> 08:27.467
[chuckles]

08:27.467 --> 08:30.801
THAT DOUCHE-BAG HAD NO RIGHT
SELLING MY "STORY"

08:30.801 --> 08:32.133
JUST 'CAUSE HIS ASS
GOT FIRED.

08:32.133 --> 08:33.868
WHEN'S THE LAST TIME
YOU SAW DR. CONLON?

08:33.868 --> 08:35.833
DAY BEFORE YESTERDAY.

08:35.833 --> 08:37.933
AND I GOT IN HIS FACE.

08:37.933 --> 08:39.634
SEE, I KNOW
HE WAS BEHIND IT.

08:39.634 --> 08:41.033
HE DENIED IT?

08:41.033 --> 08:43.501
 <i>A GUY LIKE THAT'S</i>
 <i>NOT ABOUT TO SACK UP.</i>

08:43.501 --> 08:46.234
WHICH MADE YOU ANGRIER.
 <i>HEY!</i>

08:46.234 --> 08:49.000
CONLON WAS SPREADING LIES
ABOUT BE BEING ADDICTED.

08:49.000 --> 08:51.467
BUT WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM
DON'T HELP MY CASE.

08:51.467 --> 08:53.334
IT ACTUALLY MESSES ME UP.

08:53.334 --> 08:56.634
YOU SEE, I GOT A LAWYER,
AND WE'RE SUING CONLON.

08:56.634 --> 08:59.367
NOT GONNA GET MY MONEY
OFF A MAN IF I OFF HIM.

08:59.367 --> 09:00.534
YOU FEEL ME?

09:03.300 --> 09:06.834
HE PRESENTED IT AS LOGIC,
BUT STILL, IT'S AN EXCUSE.

09:06.834 --> 09:09.934
HE COULD HAVE LOST HIS TEMPER,
DIDN'T STOP TO THINK.

09:09.934 --> 09:12.667
YEAH. I WOULDN'T SAY
HE WAS IN THE CLEAR.

09:12.667 --> 09:14.334
SHALL WE SEE
HOW FAR THE DOCTOR

09:14.334 --> 09:16.501
SPREAD HIS PARTICULAR
BRAND OF JOY?

09:16.501 --> 09:19.300
YEAH. THE LAST PEOPLE
TO SEE HIM WERE IN CHURCH.

09:19.300 --> 09:22.367
SO DR. CONLON
ATTENDED SERVICES REGULARLY.

09:22.367 --> 09:24.567
WAS HE INVOLVED
IN ANY CHURCH ACTIVITIES?

09:24.567 --> 09:26.734
WE COULD COUNT ON HIM
FOR OUR CHARITY DRIVES.

09:26.734 --> 09:28.601
THIS IS
A WELL-TO-DO CONGREGATION.

09:28.601 --> 09:31.100
[phone rings]
MANY OF HIS BEST PATIENTS
WERE ALSO INVOLVED.

09:31.100 --> 09:33.767
EXCUSE ME.

09:36.200 --> 09:38.334
I'M GLAD MAJOR CASE
IS HANDLING THIS.

09:38.334 --> 09:40.067
YOU'LL APPRECIATE
OUR NEED FOR DISCRETION.

09:40.067 --> 09:42.133
AND DR. CONLON,

09:42.133 --> 09:46.334
HE WAS HERE AT THE SERVICE
SHORTLY BEFORE HIS DEATH.

09:46.334 --> 09:47.701
YES, I REMEMBER
GREETING HIM.

09:47.701 --> 09:49.734
HIS WIFE CALLED HERE
AFTER SERVICES,

09:49.734 --> 09:51.367
WANTED HIM HOME FOR LUNCH.

09:51.367 --> 09:53.634
IT'S STRANGE SHE WOULDN'T HAVE
CALLED HIM ON HIS CELL PHONE.

09:53.634 --> 09:55.567
CELL PHONES ARE A NO-NO
IN OUR CHURCH.

09:55.567 --> 09:58.434
NOW WHAT TIME WAS--
OF COURSE THEY ARE.

09:58.434 --> 10:01.834
THAT CALL WAS AT NOON?

10:01.834 --> 10:05.100
I TALKED TO HER AT 12:15.
IT'S LOGGED.

10:05.100 --> 10:09.467
IS CARRIE'S CALL
SOMEHOW IMPORTANT?

10:09.467 --> 10:13.300
THAT MORNING? I DIDN'T CALL
AT 12:15 OR ANY OTHER TIME.

10:13.300 --> 10:15.467
THE CHURCH SECRETARY SAYS
ONE THING AND YOU SAY ANOTHER.

10:15.467 --> 10:17.100
I MEAN,
WHO ARE WE TO BELIEVE?

10:17.100 --> 10:20.000
I DIDN'T CALL HER.

10:20.000 --> 10:21.400
I SWEAR.

10:21.400 --> 10:23.434
WELL, MAYBE SHE'S TELLING
THE TRUTH.

10:23.434 --> 10:26.567
MAYBE THERE'S A REASON WHY SHE
DIDN'T WANT HER HUSBAND HOME.

10:26.567 --> 10:29.667
 <i>(Eames)</i>
 <i>YEAH, RIGHT.</i>

10:29.667 --> 10:31.868
WHO WERE YOU WITH?

10:33.901 --> 10:35.567
NO ONE.

10:35.567 --> 10:38.901
DNA RESULTS WILL PUT SOMEONE
ELSE IN THAT BED.

10:38.901 --> 10:40.734
I DON'T HAVE A LOVER.

 <i>(Goren)</i>

10:47.534 --> 10:49.334
KILLERS USUALLY
DON'T LEAVE WITNESSES.

10:49.334 --> 10:53.234
SO WHAT HAPPENED?

10:53.234 --> 10:55.400
YOUR HUSBAND CAME HOME
AND FOUND YOU WITH SOMEONE?

10:55.400 --> 10:57.234
I WAS ALONE.

10:57.234 --> 11:00.100
AFTER HE TAPED ME UP,
HE WAITED FOR MY HUSBAND.

11:00.100 --> 11:02.067
OH, SO YOU HIRED THE GUY.

11:02.067 --> 11:06.400
NO. THAT'S CRAZY.

11:06.400 --> 11:08.300

I SHOULD NOT BE TALKING
TO YOU.

11:16.534 --> 11:19.467
HE TAPED ME UP,
HE HIT ME,

11:19.467 --> 11:21.367
AND YOU THINK
THAT I KILLED RYAN.

11:21.367 --> 11:25.400
UM, I-I NEED TO CALL
A LAWYER.

11:25.400 --> 11:27.367
 <i>I'M NOT TALKING</i>
 <i>TO YOU ANYMORE.</i>

11:33.501 --> 11:35.667

DEAR FRIEND,

11:38.167 --> 11:41.300
FELLOW CONGREGANT.

11:41.300 --> 11:46.367
WE CAN'T KNOW GOD'S REASON
FOR CALLING RYAN TO HIS GLORY,

11:46.367 --> 11:48.634
SO WE CAN ONLY SAY GOOD-BYE.

11:48.634 --> 11:52.400
GO WITH GOD.

11:52.400 --> 11:55.968
CARRIE. RYAN'S PRAYER BOOK?

12:08.934 --> 12:14.167
I USED TO THINK,
TO WONDER,

12:14.167 --> 12:16.000
WHY CAN'T HE JUST DIE?

12:16.000 --> 12:17.467
PLEASE,
DON'T DO THIS, CARRIE.

12:17.467 --> 12:19.767
IT'S TRUE.
WHEN HE WAS MEAN.

12:19.767 --> 12:24.133
BUT NOW, IT'S LIKE
I MADE IT HAPPEN.

12:24.133 --> 12:26.767
DO YOU THINK HE KNEW
HOW I REALLY FELT?

13:05.934 --> 13:08.567
DETECTIVES, THIS IS
HARDLY THE TIME.

13:08.567 --> 13:10.534

THEIR RESPECTS.

COULD BE FOR A MOTORCYCLE.

YEAH, THE BLUE ISN'T SHINY
LIKE THE BLACK.

13:52.868 --> 13:56.133
IT'S STICKY. ADHESIVE.

13:56.133 --> 13:58.601
PUT ELECTRICAL TAPE
ON THOSE BLUE FLAMES,

13:58.601 --> 14:00.968
AND THE BIKE IS SOLID BLACK.

14:00.968 --> 14:03.601
THAT'S MY BIKE.

14:03.601 --> 14:04.467
IT'S NICE, MAN.

14:04.467 --> 14:06.934

14:19.868 --> 14:23.000

14:23.000 --> 14:25.033

 <i>ANY WAY YOU CAN</i>
 <i>MAKE US CERTAIN OF THAT?</i>

14:25.033 --> 14:26.834

GET TO TOUCH ME, UNDERSTAND?

14:30.000 --> 14:31.334
ALL RIGHT,
WE'LL JUST TALK DOWNTOWN.

14:31.334 --> 14:33.834
OKAY, KEVIN, WE'RE GONNA
HIRE YOU AN ATTORNEY.

14:33.834 --> 14:35.467

14:36.467 --> 14:38.701
YOU'RE WRONG

14:45.834 --> 14:48.067
MR. PAXTON.

14:48.067 --> 14:50.901
ISN'T YOUR LEGAL NAME
MICKLER?

14:50.901 --> 14:53.033
YOUR FOSTER PARENTS

14:53.033 --> 14:55.167
THE MICKLERS DIDN'T DESERVE
THE GRIEF THAT I GAVE THEM,

DESERVE THEIR NAME,

DRUG ARRESTS.

14:58.067 --> 14:59.467
I'D AGREE WITH YOU
ON THAT.

14:59.467 --> 15:02.100
YOUR JUVIE
PROBATION REPORT

15:02.100 --> 15:04.801

A LOT OF BAD CHOICES.

SUNDAY MORNING,

15:17.367 --> 15:21.634
YOU WERE SCHEDULED TO ASSIST
AT AN 11:00 SERVICE.

15:25.267 --> 15:27.767
A GREAT SERMON.

15:27.767 --> 15:30.801
UM, I'VE BEEN READING IT.

15:30.801 --> 15:32.467
IT WAS ABOUT
THE DEFINITION OF LOVE.

15:32.467 --> 15:34.734
I HEARD IT.

15:34.734 --> 15:36.734
I TRADED WITH ANOTHER GUY

15:36.734 --> 15:39.334
AND I DID
THE EARLY SERVICE INSTEAD.

15:39.334 --> 15:42.901
YOU NEED THE MORNING FREE.
FOR WHAT?

15:42.901 --> 15:45.367
SERVICE TO GOD ISN'T RESTRICTED
TO THE CHURCH.

15:45.367 --> 15:48.267
I HAD SOME OLD CLOTHES,
THINGS I DON'T WEAR ANYMORE.

15:48.267 --> 15:50.634
UH, I DROPPED THEM
AT A HOMELESS SHELTER.

15:50.634 --> 15:54.834
BLOODY BOOT PRINTS MATCHING
THE SIZE OF BOOTS YOU WEAR

15:54.834 --> 15:56.000
WERE FOUND AT THE CONLONS'.

15:56.000 --> 16:01.133
NO, I WENT TO THE--

16:10.467 --> 16:13.501
THAT'S RIGHT.
THE HOMELESS PEOPLE.

16:16.300 --> 16:18.634
I BELIEVE THAT YOU
WENT TO THE SHELTER.

16:18.634 --> 16:22.868
THAT'S THE TRUE PART
OF YOUR LIE.

16:22.868 --> 16:27.734
 <i>BUT YOU WENT</i>
 <i>AFTER THE KILLING</i>

16:27.734 --> 16:30.801

I WANTED IT.

17:17.534 --> 17:20.934
BEING ALONE, SEEING YOU
ANYTIME I WANTED.

17:20.934 --> 17:24.634
BUT THIS--

17:24.634 --> 17:27.300
THIS JUST FEELS WEIRD.

17:32.167 --> 17:34.734
THAT WHAT WE DID
WAS VERY, VERY WRONG.

17:42.934 --> 17:45.634
SO--SO WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

17:47.968 --> 17:49.434
ARE YOU BACKING AWAY

17:49.434 --> 17:50.434
NO.

NO, THAT CAME OUT WRONG.

I'M--I'M SORRY.

17:54.767 --> 17:58.767

17:58.767 --> 18:01.100
I NEED YOU TO LISTEN

18:02.767 --> 18:06.367
I NEED YOUR TENDERNESS TOO.

18:08.367 --> 18:09.567

NOT UNUSUAL THAT THE WIFE

18:37.701 --> 18:38.734
 <i>(Ross)</i>
 <i>IT'S A LITTLE NEAT.</i>

THEY DON'T HAVE TO HIRE
A HIT MAN.

18:41.767 --> 18:44.767

THE DIRTIEST LAWYER IN TOWN.

18:44.767 --> 18:47.267

18:47.267 --> 18:49.901

HE HAVE GOTTEN OUT OF THIS?

18:52.100 --> 18:54.801
KEVIN PAXTON'S
AT THE RECTORY.

18:54.801 --> 18:58.467
HE'S YOUNG,
HE'S NOT UNATTRACTIVE.

18:58.467 --> 19:00.434
SO IT WASN'T SOME DEEP,
SPIRITUAL BOND.

19:00.434 --> 19:02.901
DR. CONLON
DOESN'T SEEM THE TYPE

19:02.901 --> 19:06.033
WHO'D BE OBLIVIOUS
TO HIS WIFE'S AFFAIR.

19:06.033 --> 19:08.200
I FINALLY GOT A HOLD
OF HIS NURSE.

19:08.200 --> 19:10.200
SHE DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT CARRIE WAS UP TO,

19:10.200 --> 19:13.334
BUT SHE SAID THE DOCTOR
WAS A TOTAL GLAND.

19:13.334 --> 19:14.701
HE HIT ON EVERYONE.

19:14.701 --> 19:18.200
SO IF CARRIE WAS HURT
BY HIS BEHAVIOR

19:18.200 --> 19:20.834
OR NEEDY--

19:20.834 --> 19:25.701
IT'S FAIRLY OBVIOUS
WHO SHE'D TURN TO.

19:25.701 --> 19:29.067
A LINEUP. DO YOU KNOW WHAT
THAT MEANS? 'CAUSE I DO.

19:29.067 --> 19:31.000

THE BEST LAWYER.

19:31.000 --> 19:32.334

AND A SILENT PRAYER,

19:32.334 --> 19:33.334

POLICE TERMS.

19:39.100 --> 19:41.133

19:41.133 --> 19:43.334
I'M SORRY.

19:45.634 --> 19:47.801

AND NOW I'M NOT UNDERAGE.

19:50.667 --> 19:51.934

RYAN CONLON FOR HER.

21:18.100 --> 21:21.033

WHY WOULD HE DO THAT?

21:21.033 --> 21:23.400
YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY.

ANYTHING YET.

WHO ARE DOING WELL.

24:21.300 --> 24:23.067
SUICIDE.

24:23.067 --> 24:26.501
IT'S A HARD CHOICE FOR
SOMEONE WHO'S TRULY DEVOUT.

24:26.501 --> 24:31.000
I HAVE NO REASON TO RULE THIS
AS ANYTHING BUT SUICIDE.

24:33.634 --> 24:36.901
WYLER'S WAY OF MAKING
HIS SERMONS RELATABLE.

24:36.901 --> 24:39.334
HE ALWAYS PUTS IN A STORY
ABOUT HIMSELF.

24:39.334 --> 24:42.300
YEAH, BUT SOMETIMES
IT'S WHAT HE DOESN'T SAY.

24:42.300 --> 24:45.167
THIS ONE ON ADULTERY.

24:45.167 --> 24:47.400
THERE'S NOTHING PERSONAL
IN IT, YOU KNOW?

24:47.400 --> 24:51.434
IN FACT, HE BARELY TOUCHES
ON THE SUBJECT.

24:51.434 --> 24:53.767
HE MAKES IT A LESSON
IN FORGIVENESS.

24:53.767 --> 24:58.467
KEVIN PAXTON, HE HEARD
THESE SERMONS EVERY SUNDAY.

24:58.467 --> 25:02.234
THEY COULD HAVE BEEN
A BIG INFLUENCE IN HIS LIFE.

25:02.234 --> 25:05.868
AND HE DIDN'T BUY THE REVEREND'S
LESSON IN FORGIVENESS.

25:09.200 --> 25:10.567
I'M SORRY.

25:10.567 --> 25:12.701
I WAS TRYING TO CONTACT
THE OTHER ACOLYTES,

25:12.701 --> 25:14.100
KEVIN'S FRIENDS.

25:14.100 --> 25:17.100
YOU HAD HOPES FOR HIM.

25:17.100 --> 25:19.834
HEY, I'VE BEEN READING
YOUR SERMONS.

25:19.834 --> 25:22.968
THEY'RE FASCINATING,
BY THE WAY.

25:22.968 --> 25:24.300
OH. YEAH.

25:24.300 --> 25:25.400
TRUDY TOLD ME
THAT YOU'D ASKED

25:25.400 --> 25:27.167
THAT THE WHOLE YEAR
BE SENT TO YOUR OFFICE.

25:27.167 --> 25:29.400
YOU HAVE
A VERY METHODICAL APPROACH.

25:29.400 --> 25:32.701
YOU SEEM TO HIT EVERY ONE
OF THE SEVEN DEADLY SINS

25:32.701 --> 25:35.234
BUT SOMEHOW YOU MANAGE
TO KEEP IT FRESH.

25:35.234 --> 25:39.133
WELL, YOU FALL INTO A RUT,
THE CONGREGATION FALLS ASLEEP.

25:39.133 --> 25:42.801
I'M TRYING TO THINK
OF YOUR SERMON ON ADULTERY.

25:45.133 --> 25:48.534
DO YOU THINK ADULTERY
IS ONE OF THE LESSER SINS?

25:51.133 --> 25:52.667
[laughs lightly]

25:52.667 --> 25:55.501
SIN IS SIN, DETECTIVE.

25:55.501 --> 25:57.534
LOOK, WE'RE--WE'RE, UH,

25:57.534 --> 25:59.801
WE'RE DEALING
WITH LOSS RIGHT NOW.

25:59.801 --> 26:02.267
I'M NOT REALLY UP TO
A THEOLOGICAL DEBATE WITH YOU,

26:02.267 --> 26:03.300
IF YOU DON'T MIND.

26:03.300 --> 26:05.133
KEVIN.

26:05.133 --> 26:07.701
DO YOU KNOW WHAT MADE HIM
DESPONDENT AND SUICIDAL?

26:09.767 --> 26:11.200
WELL, I THINK
THAT'S A QUESTION

26:11.200 --> 26:14.434
YOU MIGHT BETTER
ASK YOURSELF.

26:14.434 --> 26:17.100
I HAVE.

26:17.100 --> 26:18.968
NOW I'M ASKING YOU.

26:18.968 --> 26:23.033
I BELIEVE WE ALL HAD
A HAND IN FAILING HIM.

26:23.033 --> 26:26.434
I'M EVEN MORE INCLINED NOW
TO GO WITH MY MOTIVE,

26:26.434 --> 26:30.133
THE ONE THAT YOU AVOID
IN YOUR SERMONS.

26:30.133 --> 26:32.334
THAT HE WAS HAVING SEX
WITH MRS. CONLON.

26:32.334 --> 26:36.033
NO, HE WASN'T. NO.

26:36.033 --> 26:37.901
YOU'RE WRONG.

26:40.501 --> 26:41.801
WELL, SOMEONE WAS.

26:41.801 --> 26:43.567
SOMEBODY WAS THERE
THAT MORNING.

26:43.567 --> 26:46.167
DOCTOR LEFT FOR THE HOSPITAL
AT 5:00 A.M.

26:46.167 --> 26:47.167
YOU AN EARLY RISER?

26:47.167 --> 26:50.200
YES, I AM, AT TIMES.

26:50.200 --> 26:54.033
I JUST REMEMBERED
YOUR SERMON.

26:59.367 --> 27:01.901
WOULD YOU MIND GIVING US
A SAMPLE OF YOUR DNA?

27:01.901 --> 27:03.334
YOU MIGHT AS WELL PROVE NOW

27:03.334 --> 27:04.968
THAT YOU'RE NOT THE ONE THAT
HAD SEX WITH MRS. CONLON.

27:07.067 --> 27:08.968
FINE, I'LL COMPLY
WITH YOUR REQUEST

27:08.968 --> 27:10.234
WHEN YOU HAVE A COURT ORDER.

27:10.234 --> 27:12.200
ARE YOU SATISFIED?

27:12.200 --> 27:13.200
YES, I AM.

27:13.200 --> 27:15.634
THAT'S WHAT I NEEDED.

27:22.334 --> 27:24.133
DID YOU RETURN
THE BISHOP'S CALL?

27:24.133 --> 27:25.801
NO, I DIDN'T.
NOT YET.

27:25.801 --> 27:27.968
SMART MOVE.

27:27.968 --> 27:29.367
AVOIDANCE IS ALWAYS
PERCEIVED AS STRENGTH.

27:29.367 --> 27:30.667
YOU KNOW WHAT?

27:30.667 --> 27:32.634
YOU'RE SO FULL OF ADVICE,
WHY DON'T YOU HANDLE IT?

27:32.634 --> 27:34.400
JUST HANDLE IT, ALLISON.
HANDLE IT.

27:34.400 --> 27:36.000
HMM?

27:36.000 --> 27:38.567
TELL HIM WE KNEW
ABOUT KEVIN'S RAP SHEET.

27:38.567 --> 27:40.601
THOUGHT WE'D MAKE HIM
AN ACOLYTE ANYWAY

27:40.601 --> 27:42.601
BECAUSE HE'S A BRIGHT,
SHINING EXAMPLE

27:42.601 --> 27:43.834
OF THE POWER OF FAITH.

27:43.834 --> 27:47.367
WE BOTH KNOW YOU ARE FAR
FROM BLAMELESS IN THIS.

27:52.801 --> 27:55.934

27:55.934 --> 27:57.834

28:22.467 --> 28:24.801
SHE'S CUTE.

28:24.801 --> 28:27.501
THE ACADEMIC BACKGROUND
ON MRS. WYLER?

28:27.501 --> 28:28.701
I FIGURED HER

28:28.701 --> 28:30.000
FOR A DEGREE IN SOCIAL WORK.

28:30.000 --> 28:32.767
TURNS OUT
SHE'S A SPEECH THERAPIST.

28:32.767 --> 28:37.667
A MASTER'S IN
SPEECH LANGUAGE PATHOLOGY.

28:37.667 --> 28:40.734
YOU KNOW, I REMEMBER
ODD SPEECH CHARACTERISTICS

28:40.734 --> 28:44.167
IN PAXTON'S INTERVIEW.

28:44.167 --> 28:46.200
YEAH.

28:46.200 --> 28:50.067
CERTAIN WORDS
HE ALMOST STAMMERED.

28:50.067 --> 28:53.000
LET'S READ IT OVER.

28:54.200 --> 28:56.868
CAPTAIN, THIS STATEMENT--

28:56.868 --> 28:57.934
JUST A SEC.

28:57.934 --> 29:00.300
JUST--

29:00.300 --> 29:01.601
YEAH.

29:01.601 --> 29:04.000
UH, YOU KNOW,

29:04.000 --> 29:06.367
WHEN I NOTICED KEVIN PAXTON'S
DISLIKE FOR DR. CONLON,

29:06.367 --> 29:08.701
IT MADE ME OVERLOOK
SOME THINGS.

29:08.701 --> 29:10.100
HIS--HIS STATEMENT.

29:10.100 --> 29:12.534
READ THIS RIGHT HERE.

29:12.534 --> 29:15.467
 <i>(Ross)</i>
 <i>UH, "I HAD SOME CLOTHES</i>

29:15.467 --> 29:18.200
 <i>"TO DONATE FOR THE--</i>
 <i>YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT,</i>

29:18.200 --> 29:19.200
THE HOMELESS PEOPLE."

29:19.200 --> 29:20.200
HARD TO CRAM IT ALL IN THERE.

29:20.200 --> 29:21.200
SOME PEOPLE TALK LIKE THAT.

29:21.200 --> 29:22.801
YEAH, BUT NOT HIM,
NOT USUALLY.

29:22.801 --> 29:25.334
HE USES THE PHRASE
UNDER STRESS.

29:25.334 --> 29:27.033
UM...

29:27.033 --> 29:29.334
HE USES THE PHRASE
AS A STOP,

29:29.334 --> 29:33.000
YOU KNOW, TO KEEP
FROM STUTTERING.

29:33.000 --> 29:35.567
HE WOULD HAVE LEARNED THAT
IN SPEECH THERAPY.

29:37.100 --> 29:39.501
SO BEING INTERVIEWED
STRESSES HIM OUT.

29:39.501 --> 29:41.334
I DON'T GET
THE SIGNIFICANCE.

29:41.334 --> 29:42.968
WELL, THE REVEREND'S WIFE,
MRS. WYLER,

29:42.968 --> 29:45.467
WAS A SPEECH THERAPIST.

29:47.567 --> 29:49.234
LOYAL AND DEEPLY INDEBTED
TO THE PERSON

29:49.234 --> 29:50.367
WHO TAUGHT HIM HOW TO SPEAK.

29:53.901 --> 29:56.501
ALISON WYLER
MENTORED KEVIN PAXTON

29:56.501 --> 29:57.767
WHEN HE WAS 14

29:57.767 --> 29:59.133
AND HELPED HIM GET RID
OF A STUTTER.

29:59.133 --> 30:01.934
 <i>(Goren)</i>
 <i>SO ALISON BRINGS HIM</i>

30:01.934 --> 30:03.200
INTO THE FAMILY,

30:03.200 --> 30:04.601
THE FIRST
THAT HE'S EVER HAD,

30:04.601 --> 30:06.334
AND THEN THE AFFAIR
BETWEEN REVEREND WYLER

30:06.334 --> 30:09.767
AND CARRIE CONLON THREATENS
TO TEAR IT APART.

30:09.767 --> 30:12.334
TAKE THE REVEREND
OUT OF HIS COMFORT ZONE.

30:12.334 --> 30:14.467
SEE WHAT JOGS LOOSE.

30:17.434 --> 30:19.901
HMM. TRAGIC.

30:19.901 --> 30:20.968
TRAGIC.

30:20.968 --> 30:22.234
WHY ARE WE DOING THIS?

30:22.234 --> 30:24.267
WE THINK HE KILLED
DR. CONLON

30:24.267 --> 30:26.968
AS A WAY
OF PROTECTING YOU.

30:26.968 --> 30:29.000
PROTECTING ME?

30:29.000 --> 30:31.934
WELL, A SEX SCANDAL
WOULD RUIN YOUR MINISTRY.

30:31.934 --> 30:33.367
DR. CONLON FINDS OUT

30:33.367 --> 30:34.901
YOU WERE SLEEPING WITH
HIS WIFE, THREATENS--

30:34.901 --> 30:35.901
WE'VE BEEN
THROUGH THIS BEFORE.

30:35.901 --> 30:38.434
CARRIE AND I
WERE NOT INVOLVED.

30:41.434 --> 30:45.200
YOUR REPUTATION
AS A MAN OF GOD

30:45.200 --> 30:46.400
 <i>IS WORTH THIS--</i>

 <i>KEVIN PAXTON'S LIFE.</i>

30:58.000 --> 31:00.167
LOOK...

31:00.167 --> 31:03.634
I HONESTLY DIDN'T THINK
IT WAS CONNECTED,

31:03.634 --> 31:08.367
RYAN CONLON'S DEATH
WITH CARRIE AND I.

31:08.367 --> 31:12.667
ABOUT SIX MONTHS AGO,
SHE CAME TO ME FOR COUNSELING

31:12.667 --> 31:14.033
FOR HER MARRIAGE.

31:14.033 --> 31:17.400
AND I KNOW HOW THAT SOUNDS,

31:17.400 --> 31:21.100
BUT AT THE TIME, I THOUGHT
WE WERE VERY GOOD FOR EACH OTHER

31:21.100 --> 31:25.000
AND WE DIDN'T HURT ANYBODY.

31:25.000 --> 31:27.267
THAT'S THE USUAL LIE,
ISN'T IT?

31:27.267 --> 31:29.767
CARRIE CALLED ME LAST NIGHT
AND LEFT ME A VOICEMAIL.

31:29.767 --> 31:32.133
YOU SHOULD HEAR IT.

PLAY THEM.

32:29.701 --> 32:31.501
I WANT TO HEAR THEM.

32:40.968 --> 32:44.100
TO ME, IT SOUNDS
EXACTLY LIKE HER.

32:44.100 --> 32:48.434
WELL, YOU HAVE
TO LISTEN CLOSELY.

32:48.434 --> 32:50.367
THERE ARE
SUBTLE DIFFERENCES.

32:50.367 --> 32:53.467
AND IT'S NOT
HER PERSONALITY TYPE.

32:53.467 --> 32:55.868
LIKE SAYING,
"THE ULTIMATE SACRIFICE."

32:55.868 --> 32:58.334
IT'S TOO THEATRICAL
FOR CARRIE.

32:58.334 --> 33:01.667
YEAH, AND CARRIE,
SHE USES HER SEXUALITY

33:01.667 --> 33:03.467
FOR LEVERAGE, NOT GUILT.

33:03.467 --> 33:07.334
LIKE SAYING,
"YOU DON'T APPRECIATE ME."

33:07.334 --> 33:10.133
THAT'S NOT CARRIE.

A MOTIVE?

33:15.501 --> 33:17.534

33:17.534 --> 33:20.234
I IMAGINE IT HELPS
IMITATING VOICES.

33:20.234 --> 33:22.601
SPECTROGRAPHIC ANALYSIS
COULD ELIMINATE CARRIE,

33:22.601 --> 33:24.100
BUT THEN HOW DO YOU
GET ALISON?

33:24.100 --> 33:27.934
CONVENIENTLY FOR HER,
KEVIN PAXTON IS DEAD.

33:27.934 --> 33:29.434
YEP.

33:29.434 --> 33:32.434
AND SHE COULD ACTUALLY
GET AWAY WITH IT.

33:36.534 --> 33:39.434
CAN'T FAULT ALISON
AS AN ENTHUSIASTIC MENTOR,

33:39.434 --> 33:41.667
BUT HER STYLE DIDN'T
QUITE MESH WITH OURS.

33:41.667 --> 33:43.067
SHE WAS FIRED?

33:43.067 --> 33:45.467
SHE BECAME TOO ATTACHED
TO THE BOYS,

33:45.467 --> 33:48.200
AND THEY BECAME
TOO ATTACHED TO HER.

33:48.200 --> 33:50.234
SHE ONLY MENTORED BOYS?

33:50.234 --> 33:51.667
WELL, AT THAT AGE,
FIVE TIMES AS MANY BOYS

33:51.667 --> 33:53.200
HAVE STUTTERS AS GIRLS.

33:53.200 --> 33:56.400
AT WHAT POINT DID HER CLOSENESS
WITH THESE KIDS

33:56.400 --> 33:57.534
BECOME A PROBLEM?

33:57.534 --> 34:01.400
IT WAS BECOMING
A PERSONALITY CULT.

34:01.400 --> 34:03.267
THEY IDOLIZED HER.

34:03.267 --> 34:05.100
SOME OF THE FOSTER PARENTS
COMPLAINED

34:05.100 --> 34:07.067
THAT SHE WAS UNDERMINING
THEIR AUTHORITY.

34:07.067 --> 34:09.766
AT THAT AGE, BOYS, 13, 14,

34:09.766 --> 34:12.167
THEY'RE VERY IMPRESSIONABLE.

34:12.167 --> 34:14.434
YEAH. WELL, IT'S LIKE A FANTASY
GIRLFRIEND, YOU KNOW.

34:14.434 --> 34:17.266
MORE GLAMOROUS THAN GIRLS
THEIR OWN AGE.

34:19.000 --> 34:22.300
NEED...

34:22.300 --> 34:26.067
MUST NOT BE CONFUSED
WITH LOVE.

34:26.067 --> 34:28.234
NEED CAN BE TWISTED

34:28.234 --> 34:29.801
AND PERVERSE

34:29.801 --> 34:32.701
AND DANGEROUS.

34:32.701 --> 34:35.067
IN KEVIN'S LIFE,
IT WAS NEED,

34:35.067 --> 34:37.167
NOT LOVE,

34:37.167 --> 34:41.000
THAT LED HIM
TO UNCONSCIONABLE SINS.

34:43.534 --> 34:45.000
WE CAN ONLY PRAY

34:45.000 --> 34:48.734
 <i>THAT GOD FORGIVES HIM.</i>

34:57.534 --> 35:00.634
WHY DOES ALISON ACT
WHEN SHE ACTED?

35:00.634 --> 35:03.701
WHAT PROMPTED HER TO
SOLICIT MURDER AT THIS TIME?

35:03.701 --> 35:04.968

HAVE BEEN WORRIED

ABOUT DR. CONLON'S NEED
FOR RESOURCES.

35:07.033 --> 35:10.334
SOMETHING LIKE
THE CLEON LEWIS SCANDAL

35:10.334 --> 35:11.834
BLOWING BACK ON THE CHURCH.

35:11.834 --> 35:14.033
AN ADULTEROUS
UPPER EAST SIDE MINISTER?

35:14.033 --> 35:15.734
THAT'S A HEADLINE.

35:15.734 --> 35:17.400
OKAY, SAY THAT'S MOTIVE.

35:17.400 --> 35:19.734
HOW DOES ALISON
PAY KEVIN FOR MURDER?

35:19.734 --> 35:21.000
SEX?

35:21.000 --> 35:25.767
WHO KNOWS HOW FAR
SHE TOOK IT WITH KEVIN.

35:25.767 --> 35:30.133
SO WE HAVE DECENT CONJECTURE,
BUT NO EVIDENCE.

35:34.400 --> 35:36.801
I'M GLAD YOU CALLED ME
ABOUT HIS THINGS.

35:36.801 --> 35:39.400
YOU'VE BEEN VERY COOPERATIVE.
WE APPRECIATE IT.

35:39.400 --> 35:41.267
WILL THIS TAKE LONG?

35:41.267 --> 35:42.834
THE INTERMENT
IS THIS AFTERNOON.

35:42.834 --> 35:44.534
I'D LIKE HIM TO BE BURIED
WITH HIS MEMENTOS.

35:44.534 --> 35:46.534
WELL, WE'RE ALMOST DONE.

35:46.534 --> 35:48.400
THE ONLY THING THAT, UH,

35:48.400 --> 35:49.801
WE HAVEN'T FOUND IS EVIDENCE

35:49.801 --> 35:51.234
THAT CARRIE CONLON
SOLICITED HIM

35:51.234 --> 35:52.400
TO COMMIT MURDER.

35:52.400 --> 35:53.567
THERE YOU GO.

35:53.567 --> 35:56.734
WHAT ABOUT WHAT SHE SAID
TO DAN ON THE PHONE?

35:56.734 --> 35:58.734
UH, WELL,

35:58.734 --> 36:01.901
 <i>CARRIE CLAIMS</i>
 <i>SHE NEVER MADE THAT CALL.</i>

36:01.901 --> 36:05.534
YOU HAVE
THE PHONE MESSAGE.

36:05.534 --> 36:07.133
IT'S NOT ENOUGH.
SHE NEVER MENTIONED KEVIN.

36:07.133 --> 36:09.934
 <i>(Goren)</i>
 <i>WE CAN SEE</i>
 <i>HOW SHE COULD EASILY</i>

36:09.934 --> 36:11.067
MANIPULATE.

36:11.067 --> 36:13.501
I MEAN, JUST ON HER--

36:13.501 --> 36:16.267
JUST A PURELY
PHYSICAL LEVEL, I MEAN.

36:16.267 --> 36:18.634
SLEEPING WITH HER
WAS HIS DREAM.

36:18.634 --> 36:21.834
 <i>AND I'M SAYING THIS</i>
 <i>NOT IN JUDGMENT,</i>

36:21.834 --> 36:24.767
BUT WE KNOW THAT OTHERS
SHARED THAT DREAM.

36:24.767 --> 36:28.901
NO. KEVIN WASN'T
TAKEN WITH HER.

36:28.901 --> 36:30.868
HIS IDEAL WAS SOMEONE
QUITE DIFFERENT.

36:30.868 --> 36:32.934
MY GOD, OF COURSE.

36:32.934 --> 36:36.767
HE HAD FEELINGS FOR YOU
BEFORE HE JOINED THE CHURCH,

36:36.767 --> 36:37.801
BACK WHEN
YOU WERE HIS MENTOR.

36:37.801 --> 36:40.133
NOT SEXUAL FEELINGS.

36:40.133 --> 36:42.534
KEVIN WAS ATTRACTED
TO SOMETHING MORE PROFOUND.

36:42.534 --> 36:45.000
TEENAGE BOY?

36:45.000 --> 36:46.501
[chuckles]

36:46.501 --> 36:47.634
NO.

36:47.634 --> 36:49.601
WE HEARD THAT THE BOYS
THAT YOU MENTORED

36:49.601 --> 36:51.434
WERE IN LOVE WITH YOU.

36:51.434 --> 36:53.868
PLEASE. FROM THOSE GOSSIPS
IN CHILDREN'S SERVICES?

36:53.868 --> 36:55.634
ALL THAT POWER
OVER OTHERS.

36:55.634 --> 36:59.934
YOU KNOW, I WAS
LOOKING THROUGH THIS.

36:59.934 --> 37:01.367
I NOTICED SOMETHING
THAT KEVIN WROTE

37:01.367 --> 37:03.734
AT THE END
OF HIS DAILY PRAYERS.

37:03.734 --> 37:05.501
IT WAS A PLEA.

37:05.501 --> 37:07.667
"HEAVENLY FATHER,
GIVE ME THE STRENGTH

37:07.667 --> 37:10.934
TO MAKE THE ULTIMATE SACRIFICE
FOR YOUR MINISTRY."

37:10.934 --> 37:12.234
 <i>(Eames)</i>
 <i>"ULTIMATE SACRIFICE"?</i>

37:12.234 --> 37:14.000
YEAH.

37:14.000 --> 37:16.434
WELL, THERE'S A CONNECTION.

37:16.434 --> 37:17.601
WHAT ARE THE CHANCES

37:17.601 --> 37:19.167
TWO PEOPLE WOULD COME UP
WITH THAT PHRASE?

37:19.167 --> 37:21.501
CARRIE CONLON
DESCRIBED IN HER VOICEMAIL

37:21.501 --> 37:24.167
THE MURDER AS
AN "ULTIMATE SACRIFICE."

37:24.167 --> 37:27.033
SO THERE'S YOUR PROOF,
YOUR LINK TO CARRIE.

37:27.033 --> 37:28.033
YEAH. IT WON'T WORK.

37:28.033 --> 37:30.033
IT'S NOT CARRIE
ON THAT VOICEMAIL.

37:30.033 --> 37:32.400
IT'S YOU.

37:32.400 --> 37:34.767
THAT'S ABSURD.

37:34.767 --> 37:36.667
YOU'RE A VERY GOOD MIMIC.

37:39.834 --> 37:43.100
THIS IS A VOICEMAIL GRAPH.

37:43.100 --> 37:47.634
THIS IS CARRIE.
THAT'S YOU.

37:47.634 --> 37:50.367
I MEAN, YOU DIDN'T
GET EVERYTHING RIGHT.

37:50.367 --> 37:53.000
I MEAN, TONE, PITCH,
EVERYTHING WAS THERE.

37:53.000 --> 37:55.300
EXCEPT FOR THE, UM,

37:55.300 --> 37:56.734
THE BREATH.

37:56.734 --> 37:59.567
WHERE YOU BREATHE
WHEN YOU SPEAK.

37:59.567 --> 38:01.133
THAT CAN'T BE ALTERED.

38:01.133 --> 38:02.501
IT'S CONNECTED
TO YOUR NERVOUS SYSTEM.

38:02.501 --> 38:03.434
DO YOU WANNA--

38:05.167 --> 38:07.167
THIS IS CARRIE.

38:07.167 --> 38:09.934
 <i>(Carrie)</i>
 <i>YOU NEVER THANKED ME</i>
 <i>FOR YOUR BIRTHDAY PRESENT.</i>

38:09.934 --> 38:14.067
 <i>I MADE THE ULTIMATE SACRIFICE</i>
 <i>FOR YOU, FOR US,</i>

38:14.067 --> 38:15.701
 <i>AND NOW YOU'RE PULLING AWAY</i>
 <i>FROM ME.</i>

38:15.701 --> 38:17.300
 <i>IT'S NOT FAIR.</i>

38:17.300 --> 38:19.634
AND THIS IS YOU.

38:19.634 --> 38:22.300
 <i>(Alison)</i>
 <i>YOU NEVER THANKED ME</i>
 <i>FOR YOUR BIRTHDAY PRESENT.</i>

38:22.300 --> 38:26.300

 <i>AND NOW YOU'RE PULLING AWAY</i>
 <i>FROM ME.</i>

38:28.901 --> 38:30.434
 <i>IT'S NOT FAIR.</i>

38:32.267 --> 38:35.167
CATCH THE DIFFERENCE
IN THE BREATHS?

38:35.167 --> 38:38.467
 <i>(Eames)</i>
 <i>20 WORDS WITH THE SAME</i>

38:38.467 --> 38:41.934

A VOICEPRINT I.D.

38:41.934 --> 38:43.200
WE CAN PROVE THIS WAS YOU.

38:43.200 --> 38:45.567
ALL YOU CAN PROVE
IS THAT IT WASN'T CARRIE.

38:45.567 --> 38:48.367
I'M A TRAINED SPEECH THERAPIST.
I CAN READ A VOICEPRINT.

38:48.367 --> 38:50.734
YOU READY TO BET YOUR LIFE
ON IT?

38:50.734 --> 38:52.801
YOU'VE GONE TO GREAT LENGTHS
TO HURT MY MINISTRY.

38:52.801 --> 38:54.033
YOU'RE NOT THE FIRST.

38:54.033 --> 38:56.200
AND YOU WILL NOT SUCCEED,
EITHER.

38:58.334 --> 39:00.200
YOU MEAN CARRIE.

39:02.400 --> 39:04.667
SHE DISTRACTED MY HUSBAND
FROM HIS PURPOSE.

39:04.667 --> 39:06.667
 <i>SHE'S TRASH.</i>

39:06.667 --> 39:08.567
 <i>(Eames)</i>
 <i>YOUR HUSBAND DIDN'T SEE IT</i>
 <i>THAT WAY.</i>

39:08.567 --> 39:10.133
 <i>(Alison)</i>
 <i>HE WAS BLINDED BY HER.</i>

39:10.133 --> 39:12.267
ONCE DAN SAW HER DIMINISHED
AND RIGHTLY ACCUSED,

39:12.267 --> 39:13.434
I KNEW HE'D REJECT HER.

39:13.434 --> 39:16.067
SO DR. CONLON PAID
THE ULTIMATE PRICE.

39:16.067 --> 39:18.634
RYAN CONLON LIVED
BY EXPOSING PEOPLE.

39:18.634 --> 39:20.834
HE COULD HAVE TURNED
OUR PARISHIONERS AGAINST US.

39:20.834 --> 39:22.067
POOR KEVIN.

39:22.067 --> 39:24.767
HE WAS COLLATERAL DAMAGE
TO YOUR SENSE OF GREATER GOOD.

39:26.300 --> 39:29.667
I CARED ABOUT KEVIN.
I DID.

39:29.667 --> 39:32.534
 <i>BUT HIS DEATH RESTS</i>
 <i>ON YOUR CONSCIENCE,</i>

39:32.534 --> 39:35.167
NOT ON MINE.

39:35.167 --> 39:38.434
YOU'LL NEVER CONVICT ME
IN COURT.

39:38.434 --> 39:41.501
YOUR FINAL JUDGMENT WILL--

39:41.501 --> 39:44.067
WELL, IT WON'T
TAKE PLACE IN COURT.

39:51.067 --> 39:54.634
THEN YOU KNOW MY SACRIFICE
HAD NO BOUNDS.

39:54.634 --> 39:57.133
WHAT I DID WAS FOR US,
FOR ALL THAT WE BUILT.

39:57.133 --> 40:00.667
DOES THAT MAKE IT RIGHT?

40:00.667 --> 40:02.634
DO YOU HEAR YOURSELF,
ALISON?

40:02.634 --> 40:03.734
WE'VE BROUGHT
THE WORD OF GOD

40:03.734 --> 40:06.033
TO THE MOST IMPORTANT PEOPLE
IN THIS CITY.

40:06.033 --> 40:07.868
I PRESERVED OUR GOOD WORK.

40:07.868 --> 40:09.434
TELL ME YOU UNDERSTAND THAT.

40:09.434 --> 40:14.834
YES, I UNDERSTAND.
