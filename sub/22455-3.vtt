00:02.650 --> 00:06.087
<i>I'm not sick but I'm not well</i>

00:06.131 --> 00:09.123
<i>And I'm so hot</i>

00:09.171 --> 00:13.688
<i>Cos I'm in hell</i>

00:20.133 --> 00:21.612
God, you're great.

00:21.653 --> 00:24.043
Thanks, Jez. You're great, too.

00:25.054 --> 00:27.852
Sometimes, I'd like to die and climb inside you.

00:28.854 --> 00:30.368
OK.

00:30.415 --> 00:34.124
'Was that too much? No. Go on, ask her.'

00:35.736 --> 00:40.173
Nancy, I was wondering
whether you'd consider being, maybe,

00:40.216 --> 00:44.972
my proper, you know,
just-you-and-me, girlfriend.

00:46.417 --> 00:52.209
Wow. Um... I don't know.
I mean, that's really nice, Jeremy, but...

00:52.258 --> 00:53.692
'There's always a "but".'

00:53.739 --> 00:55.695
We're so different.

00:55.739 --> 00:59.699
I've got my religion, my yogacize, my charity stuff.

00:59.740 --> 01:03.289
I just... don't know where you'd fit in as a
boyfriend.

01:03.340 --> 01:07.095
But I really like you
and we have a great time together.

01:07.141 --> 01:10.531
Well, I really like you too,
and we do have a good time together, but...

01:10.581 --> 01:11.571
'That's the second "but".'

01:11.622 --> 01:13.817
What about all the other stuff?

01:13.862 --> 01:14.897
Other stuff?

01:14.942 --> 01:18.982
Look, obviously, God wanted us to enjoy ourselves.

01:19.023 --> 01:23.222
I mean, that's why he invented
pills, clubs, lube and hardcore.

01:23.264 --> 01:26.813
But he also wanted us to give something back.

01:26.864 --> 01:30.574
And that's why he created
the homeless, the lepers and the oil spills.

01:30.625 --> 01:32.900
'God, suck up to God.'

01:32.945 --> 01:37.144
Nancy, listen.
The only reason that I don't go to church

01:37.186 --> 01:41.100
is that, for me, everything's a church.

01:41.147 --> 01:44.184
This room is my church.

01:44.227 --> 01:47.140
The hall is my church.

01:47.188 --> 01:51.500
Costcutter's is a bloody cathedral.

01:52.589 --> 01:55.228
That's really nice, Jeremy.

01:55.269 --> 01:58.501
It's just not true, is it?

02:02.350 --> 02:05.866
'End of quarter sales push.
Pulling an all-nighter.

02:05.911 --> 02:08.630
'One of the few in my Spitfire.

02:08.670 --> 02:13.507
'Who am I kidding? I probably would have
crashed my training plane in the Phony War.'

02:14.792 --> 02:18.945
'Uh-oh, bollocks! Giggling, sharing.

02:18.993 --> 02:21.712
'Shall I intervene? No.

02:21.753 --> 02:26.032
'It's fine. It's totally fine. Que sera, sera,

02:26.074 --> 02:28.464
'whatever will be, will be.

02:28.515 --> 02:30.904
'The future's not ours to see.

02:30.955 --> 02:33.549
'lf she fucks him, I'll kill myself.'

02:35.116 --> 02:36.549
All right there, mate?

02:36.596 --> 02:37.267
Hi.

02:37.316 --> 02:39.671
Hobnobs. Thought you might like some, mate.

02:39.716 --> 02:43.073
You know, pulling an all-nighter,
we're all in it together, mate.

02:43.117 --> 02:43.674
Right.

02:43.717 --> 02:44.991
'Hope this works.'

02:45.037 --> 02:47.552
Well, that's nice.

02:49.878 --> 02:51.152
Do you want to come in?

02:51.198 --> 02:53.759
'Mate! The magic code word.

02:53.799 --> 02:57.713
'Instant rapport
with taxi drivers, builders and garage men.'

02:57.760 --> 03:00.797
Blimey, mate. Look at all these TVs.

03:00.840 --> 03:03.070
You can see it all from in here, can't you?

03:03.120 --> 03:06.079
Yep. So, er, what's your name, pal?

03:06.121 --> 03:08.396
'Pal? Is he a pal person? '

03:08.441 --> 03:10.398
Mark, pal.

03:10.442 --> 03:14.401
Ah, Terry. Mark here's brought us some biscuits.

03:14.442 --> 03:15.318
Cheers, mate.

03:15.362 --> 03:17.797
'Now we're back to mate! This is a nightmare.'

03:17.843 --> 03:20.516
No problem, mate, pal.

03:20.563 --> 03:25.240
So, I bet I can see my... mates from up here, yeah?

03:25.284 --> 03:30.803
Oh, yeah, look, there they are. Laughing away
like a pair of bloody idiots at absolutely nothing.

03:30.845 --> 03:33.120
Your mate's getting fresh, is he?

03:33.165 --> 03:35.680
'Oh, God! Oh, God! No! '

03:35.726 --> 03:38.035
Hey, Tel. Get me a tape.

03:38.086 --> 03:40.885
'Don't tape it, stop it! Charge up your tasers.'

03:40.927 --> 03:43.521
Ooh, look at that!

03:43.567 --> 03:45.798
That... is...

03:45.848 --> 03:47.679
hilarious.

03:47.728 --> 03:50.401
- Tell you what, he can give her one from me!
- And me.

03:50.448 --> 03:52.917
Ha-ha. Brilliant.

03:54.009 --> 03:57.923
'God, I'm good.
It's a Saturday night and I'm doing good.

03:57.970 --> 04:02.248
'Come on, give us a smile!
You don't know I'm here with an ulterior motive! '

04:02.290 --> 04:04.202
- Jeremy!
- Nancy!

04:04.251 --> 04:06.606
Since when were you involved with street work?

04:06.651 --> 04:11.009
Since forever. Bloody hell, this is amazing!
I had no idea you were into this stuff, too!

04:11.052 --> 04:13.646
Really? I'm pretty sure I mentioned it.

04:13.692 --> 04:17.732
No, I don't think you did,
because if you had, I'd have mentioned it too.

04:17.773 --> 04:18.762
Right.

04:18.813 --> 04:23.683
Yeah, I love hobos. Always have, always will.
And they're a great bunch, the Jesus Cave Crew.

04:23.734 --> 04:28.763
Yeah... Although, don't you think sometimes
they can be a bit patronising?

04:28.815 --> 04:34.732
Like, "Sorry we're out of soup and bread, but this
is lucky, we have lots of wine and tiny wafers!"

04:34.776 --> 04:36.573
Yeah, that is so whack!

04:36.616 --> 04:41.293
I mean Jesus fed a multitude of followers
with just five loaves and two fishes.

04:41.337 --> 04:43.487
Matthew, chapter 14.

04:43.537 --> 04:45.415
Nancy! >

04:48.258 --> 04:49.373
See ya later, honey.

04:49.418 --> 04:51.375
Later, baby!

04:51.419 --> 04:55.571
'Mmm, I'll probably get to bone her later.'
Cheer up, Beardie! Everything's coming up roses!

04:58.260 --> 05:00.899
Another cup of tea, girlfriend?

05:00.940 --> 05:03.011
I'm good, thanks.

05:03.821 --> 05:04.936
Boyfriend.

05:05.661 --> 05:10.975
Ah! This is the worst bit.
I hate this bit. This is the worst bit.

05:11.022 --> 05:14.299
Come on, mate. There's no point torturing
yourself.

05:14.343 --> 05:16.254
It's not torture, it's research!

05:16.303 --> 05:20.741
Besides, I can torture myself if I want to.
What are you going to do? Call Amnesty?

05:20.784 --> 05:25.619
See? That! That's the push!
She can't get away. He's some sort of animal.

05:25.664 --> 05:29.897
- Did you see the push, Jeremy?
- Yeah, sure, that looked terrible.

05:29.945 --> 05:34.542
Looks like a one-off, though, doesn't it?
A crazy flash in the pan. Don't you think?

05:34.586 --> 05:37.544
Nancy, you're her friend. Give me your analysis.

05:37.586 --> 05:41.466
I mean, did she tell you what happened... after?

05:41.507 --> 05:44.466
Apparently,
he took her to the bathroom for a little bit of...

05:46.108 --> 05:48.303
but Sophie was totally not into it.
- Oh.

05:48.348 --> 05:52.137
So they went back to his place,
they made out for hours and she jerked him off.

05:52.189 --> 05:53.258
Oh.

05:53.309 --> 05:56.746
But then he went away and he hasn't called
and she's really pissed off about it.

05:56.790 --> 05:58.621
Oh!

05:58.670 --> 06:00.467
Brilliant.

06:01.991 --> 06:06.223
And our ambition should be to kill clients.
I mean actually kill them.

06:06.271 --> 06:09.389
With our levels of service. So they're dead.

06:09.432 --> 06:14.143
'She's not going to smile, Jeff.
You can't laugh at someone you don't trust.

06:14.193 --> 06:18.505
'It's like Mum singing the lumberjack song
after she had her affair.'

06:18.553 --> 06:22.103
So, Aberdeen. I need a couple
of experienced credit managers up there

06:22.154 --> 06:25.032
for ten days on-site personnel training.

06:25.074 --> 06:27.543
I was thinking Sophie and Jeff.

06:27.595 --> 06:33.193
'No, no, no! Ten days!
He can wheedle his way back in in ten days! '

06:33.236 --> 06:37.594
So, unless anyone else has any thoughts,
let's wrap up and have a couple of frapuccinos.

06:37.637 --> 06:40.709
- Yes, I have a thought.
- Uh-huh.

06:40.757 --> 06:43.989
I very much don't think it's a good idea.

06:44.038 --> 06:46.916
Oh, OK. And why is that?

06:48.158 --> 06:50.832
It's just a hunch, OK?

06:50.879 --> 06:52.756
And I always trust my hunches.

06:52.799 --> 06:55.712
Thanks, Columbo.

06:55.760 --> 06:59.196
And, plus, Jeff doesn't have much experience.

06:59.240 --> 07:03.234
The 2003 Scottish Consumer Directive,
for example.

07:03.281 --> 07:04.839
I really don't think that affects us, Alan.

07:04.881 --> 07:08.192
Oh, it doesn't affect us
that during the first phone contact

07:08.242 --> 07:12.201
we're obliged to set out, without abbreviation,
the terms of a standard repayment plan?

07:12.242 --> 07:17.715
'I've shot you, Jeff, with a bullet
made of Scottish finance regulations! '

07:17.763 --> 07:22.042
So, Mark, would you be prepared to go up there
with Sophie if that's the way things panned out?

07:22.084 --> 07:26.715
Yeah, Alan, I suppose I could... probably make that.

07:26.765 --> 07:30.839
'Even if I have to cut off all my limbs
and crawl to Aberdeen on my tongue.'

07:30.886 --> 07:34.196
I can't believe he's wormed his way back in.

07:34.246 --> 07:38.718
Yeah. Well, his mum was really ill, apparently.
That's why he didn't call Sophie.

07:38.767 --> 07:41.156
Bastard! Perfect alibi.

07:41.207 --> 07:45.121
Still, thanks for that heads up on the date, mate.
Great to be able to monitor.

07:45.168 --> 07:49.003
And if anyone asks,
we're just having a lovely innocent picnic!

07:49.049 --> 07:53.679
Oops. Looks like he's having
a bit of trouble with the Humpty.

07:53.729 --> 07:55.766
Keeps rolling on out.

07:55.810 --> 07:57.687
Brilliant.

07:57.730 --> 08:02.566
Although, apparently, she finds that amusing.
They're laughing, Jez!

08:02.611 --> 08:04.203
They're having a good time!

08:04.251 --> 08:07.801
'Got to stop it.
Throw a snack. Hit him on the head.

08:07.852 --> 08:12.927
'No. Get them to film it.
Build up a library of taped evidence.

08:12.973 --> 08:16.204
'Right, evidence that I'm an obsessive voyeur.'

08:17.933 --> 08:20.402
Bad news, bad news, bad news.

08:20.454 --> 08:22.490
Jesus, Jeremy, one bus crash!

08:22.534 --> 08:27.051
What about all the buses
that made it safely to their destination?

08:27.095 --> 08:30.725
Yeah. Yeah, this is such bullshit.

08:30.776 --> 08:33.495
Yes, I suppose the news
should be a dispassionate list

08:33.535 --> 08:36.210
of all the events
that have occurred during the day

08:36.256 --> 08:40.375
That would be good.
Except, of course, it would take for ever!

08:40.417 --> 08:43.251
'... promised firm action
to move on nuisance drinkers from... '

08:43.298 --> 08:46.734
That's... That's... That's our picnic!

08:46.778 --> 08:48.656
You can't see the Kettle Chips.

08:48.699 --> 08:51.930
Ha-ha-ha! Bloody hell!

08:51.979 --> 08:54.619
Whose business is it where you do your drinking?

08:54.660 --> 08:56.491
I wasn't drinking, I was having a picnic!

09:00.141 --> 09:01.859
Hello?

09:01.901 --> 09:04.369
Mum, we were having a picnic.

09:04.421 --> 09:07.937
Tell Dad it was a picnic. You can't see the crisps!

09:07.982 --> 09:10.735
We had three different flavours of crisps!

09:10.782 --> 09:13.741
Explain to him. And Scotch eggs!

09:13.783 --> 09:18.619
Yeah, no, really, I'm... I'm fine.
Listen, I've got to go.

09:19.864 --> 09:21.183
Cock knobs!

09:21.224 --> 09:24.934
Mark, don't worry.
These things, they happen for a reason.

09:24.985 --> 09:28.580
It might not seem like there's a plan,
but there is a plan.

09:28.625 --> 09:31.060
Oh, right. You believe in a god, do you?

09:31.106 --> 09:35.065
Yes, I do.
And you might find it a comfort at a time when...

09:35.106 --> 09:38.861
No, there's no evidence for God,
whereas Ofcom has published guidelines.

09:38.907 --> 09:41.820
So does God. It's called the Bible.

09:41.868 --> 09:46.020
Oh, yes, the Bible. And I wonder
what the Bible's view is on you doing it

09:46.068 --> 09:48.139
in the shower and the garden centre

09:48.189 --> 09:51.499
and up the bum.
I mean, that's all right, is it, that's in the Bible?

09:51.549 --> 09:53.859
<i>Or do you think maybe that's not in the Bible?</i>

09:53.910 --> 09:55.025
Mark!

09:56.150 --> 09:58.459
I'm sure it is in the Bible, somewhere.

09:58.510 --> 10:02.504
Probably in Corinthians.
There's a load of weird shit in there.

10:04.711 --> 10:09.308
'Are they staring?
They're all staring at the drunk off the news.

10:09.352 --> 10:12.584
'Yeah, well, fuck them!
Me and Sophie are going to Aberdeen.

10:12.633 --> 10:14.863
'I'll make everything all right in Aberdeen.

10:14.913 --> 10:19.146
'They're probably not even staring.
Just being paranoid, as usual.

10:19.194 --> 10:20.263
'Oh, fuck! '

10:22.194 --> 10:25.312
All right. Ha-ha Very funny

10:25.355 --> 10:28.950
Yeah, I can take a joke as well as anyone else,

10:28.995 --> 10:34.354
but, if there are any more jokes,
I'm taking it to a fucking industrial tribunal, OK?

10:34.396 --> 10:36.786
Mark. Can I have a word?

10:37.837 --> 10:41.467
Let me explain. It was a picnic.
I'm currently speaking to Ofcom.

10:41.518 --> 10:44.476
- Right.
- I mean, we had three flavours of crisps.

10:44.518 --> 10:47.875
- Sure.
- Good. Well, I'm glad you understand.

10:47.919 --> 10:50.274
Oh, I understand. Totally.

10:51.679 --> 10:53.989
Mark, listen. I've been there.

10:54.040 --> 10:57.396
I've been to the bottom of the bottle
and back to the top.

10:57.440 --> 10:58.509
No, Alan, I...

10:58.560 --> 11:04.033
We're kindred spirits, Mark.
Like George W or Alastair Campbell.

11:04.081 --> 11:06.596
We want it all and we want it now.

11:06.642 --> 11:10.636
And if we're not hitting our targets,
we're hitting the bottle. Right?

11:10.683 --> 11:12.878
Alan, I'm not an alcoholic.

11:12.923 --> 11:18.874
Sure. Sure you're not.
That's what I told myself every day for 15 years.

11:18.924 --> 11:23.316
But until you face your demons
and put the plug in the jug,

11:23.365 --> 11:28.234
how can I trust you to be my main man
in the office, let alone Frankfurt or Aberdeen?

11:28.285 --> 11:31.915
'I've got to go to Aberdeen.
I've got the Rough Guide!

11:31.966 --> 11:35.676
'I could always sell it on eBay.
No, I've got to go to Aberdeen with Sophie! '

11:38.847 --> 11:41.237
Have you found it yet? >

11:41.288 --> 11:42.437
Found what?

11:42.488 --> 11:46.528
The bit... You know,
the bit where it says it's OK to do it up the bum.

11:46.569 --> 11:49.686
I'm not looking for that. I'm just reading.

11:49.729 --> 11:52.881
OK. Sorry. Sorry.

11:54.850 --> 11:57.523
Listen, Jez...

11:57.570 --> 11:59.846
I want to ask you something,

11:59.891 --> 12:02.803
if we can do something very special.

12:04.252 --> 12:07.642
'So glad I didn't rub one out in the shower.'

12:07.692 --> 12:11.242
I think it's time we break the last taboo.

12:11.293 --> 12:15.252
Brilliant. It's not going to hurt, is it? What is it?

12:15.293 --> 12:17.364
Is it in the ear?

12:17.414 --> 12:21.805
Listen. Now,
we've done it round every which way there is.

12:21.854 --> 12:25.848
<i>I'm just wondering
if we shouldn't try not doing it.</i>

12:27.135 --> 12:28.535
Not doing it?

12:28.576 --> 12:30.965
Yeah. Wouldn't that be amazing?

12:31.016 --> 12:34.851
'No. Not amazing. Wrong. Think, brain.'

12:34.897 --> 12:36.774
Yeah.

12:37.977 --> 12:43.257
Or, I tell you what, go the other way.
Do a John and Yoko.

12:43.298 --> 12:48.896
Never stop doing it or get out of bed, until
all the injustice in the world is totally sorted.

12:48.939 --> 12:53.172
Jeremy, I really want to give this a go.
It's a real deal-breaker for me.

12:54.060 --> 12:56.654
Well, then. Let's give it a go.

12:58.061 --> 13:01.895
This isn't anything to do with what Mark said, is
it?

13:01.941 --> 13:03.660
No, of course not.

13:03.702 --> 13:06.819
Because you know he's just the ghost at the feast,
don't you?

13:07.622 --> 13:10.262
I'm so glad you understand.

13:10.303 --> 13:12.021
You're great, Jez.

13:12.063 --> 13:14.452
'This is fine. We don't need sex. We can talk.

13:14.503 --> 13:18.622
'Maybe I can get her to talk dirty
while I pull myself off.'

13:21.945 --> 13:23.697
Hello.

13:23.745 --> 13:25.861
My... My name's Mark...

13:25.905 --> 13:27.897
and...

13:27.946 --> 13:30.506
I'm an alcoholic.

13:32.666 --> 13:35.545
Uh... So, I'm a...

13:35.587 --> 13:39.057
lager drinker, mainly.

13:39.108 --> 13:44.466
I think I had my first one when I was about 14.

13:44.508 --> 13:46.943
Hofmeister.

13:46.989 --> 13:51.029
You remember? The bear with the porkpie hat.

13:51.070 --> 13:52.981
Yeah.

13:53.030 --> 13:54.986
'Surely, that's enough.'

13:55.030 --> 13:56.429
Let it out.

13:56.470 --> 13:58.746
Yeah, so...

14:00.311 --> 14:02.906
Lately, it's got really bad.

14:05.512 --> 14:07.980
I've been on the...

14:08.032 --> 14:09.944
rum and Coke.

14:11.753 --> 14:13.505
'More? '

14:13.553 --> 14:16.273
And vodka and gin.

14:16.314 --> 14:20.626
All mixed up.
It's not even a proper cocktail. It's just made-up.

14:20.675 --> 14:24.145
And I just drink that and stay at home.

14:26.275 --> 14:28.710
And eat oven chips...

14:29.756 --> 14:32.111
out of the bag, frozen...

14:35.477 --> 14:38.788
until I throw up on myself.

14:41.838 --> 14:44.592
That's how pissed I've been.

14:45.719 --> 14:47.391
Thanks.

14:47.439 --> 14:51.274
'God, they'll believe anything!
All you've got to do is turn up and moan.'

14:51.320 --> 14:53.197
<i>Thank you, Mark.</i>

14:53.240 --> 14:56.870
'What's so great about sex, anyway?
It's all in the mind.

14:56.921 --> 15:01.551
'Her soft skin is just a big bag full of
kidneys and mucus and half-digested bits of pie.

15:01.601 --> 15:07.871
'I bet she's got really nice kidneys.
Oh, yeah, I'd fuck those kidneys real good.

15:07.922 --> 15:10.756
'She looks fine. Why am I not fine and she's fine?

15:10.803 --> 15:16.003
'She's probably getting some somewhere.
Maybe she's doing it with him.'

15:16.044 --> 15:18.000
Excuse me, is there a soup without meat?

15:18.044 --> 15:22.914
Listen, mate. Beggars can't be choosers, all right?

15:22.965 --> 15:25.604
'Oh, right! Now, they're laughing.

15:25.645 --> 15:29.161
'What's so bloody hilarious?
That's it, that is the fucking limit! '

15:29.206 --> 15:31.674
Hi. What's so funny? What's the big joke?

15:31.726 --> 15:35.356
Hey Jez. Shouldn't you be sorting out the queue?

15:35.407 --> 15:36.362
Why, what are you doing that's so important?

15:36.407 --> 15:40.720
Oh, I was just helping Nim fill out
some benefit forms. They're a real pain.

15:40.768 --> 15:43.282
I'm gonna go and do the soup.

15:44.769 --> 15:47.886
I know your game.
I know what you're up to, Nim.

15:47.929 --> 15:49.044
What?

15:49.089 --> 15:51.888
Oh, sure, yeah,
you need help filling your forms in

15:51.930 --> 15:57.801
"Ooh, please, Missus, I've been on the streets
for so long I've forgotten how to use a pen."

15:57.851 --> 16:00.206
She offered and I just said yes.

16:00.251 --> 16:03.005
Why do you even need them at all?

16:04.652 --> 16:08.123
"Oh, my forms! My precious forms!"

16:08.173 --> 16:12.689
I've got my eye on you, mate.

16:15.854 --> 16:18.493
'It's fine, there's nothing to worry about.

16:18.694 --> 16:22.131
'She's not fucking anyone.
We're just sitting watching TV.

16:25.255 --> 16:27.212
'That's bad body language.

16:27.256 --> 16:30.931
'She hasn't mentioned that homeless guy once.
Probably wants me to forget all about him.

16:30.976 --> 16:33.127
'That's it, she's off! She's leaving me. Fuck! '

16:33.177 --> 16:35.008
Where are you going?

16:35.057 --> 16:38.209
- I just wanted some more juice. You want some?
- Sure.

16:38.258 --> 16:43.538
<i>'Relax, play it cool. She loves me.
She's not just here cos she hasn't got a TV.'</i>

16:45.939 --> 16:49.853
Oh, listen, Jez. I forgot to mention,
Nim's going to be moving into my flat.

16:49.900 --> 16:52.698
What the fuck? Nim, the homeless guy?

16:52.740 --> 16:54.935
Just until he gets his own hostel place.

16:54.980 --> 16:58.212
Jesus, Jez! Nothing's gonna happen!

16:58.261 --> 17:02.414
He's homeless, Jez. He sleeps rough every night.

17:02.462 --> 17:04.851
Exactly. He's fine! It's what he does.

17:04.902 --> 17:10.057
He probably loves it, the rolling hills, the heather.
Don't fence him in.

17:10.103 --> 17:11.741
It's only until they sort out his claim.

17:11.782 --> 17:16.414
Look, this is ridiculous.
We've got this massive sofa. Nim should stay here.

17:16.464 --> 17:20.856
Yeah, it'll be a laugh. I love the homeless.
One of my own would be amazing.

17:20.905 --> 17:25.900
I could look after him.
Not like a Tamagotchi. Better.

17:25.945 --> 17:28.699
I'm fine, Dad. Please. >

17:28.746 --> 17:31.341
There's no need to come and stay. >

17:31.387 --> 17:37.338
I know it was on the news, but you know what the
news is like these days. They just make it all up.

17:37.388 --> 17:41.825
No, no, no. OK. But please don't use that voice. >

17:41.868 --> 17:44.781
All right. See you at the station. >

17:49.710 --> 17:51.940
- Hello.
- Hello.

17:54.871 --> 18:00.104
Jez, there's someone I don't know
sitting on the sofa eating my Sara Lee.

18:00.151 --> 18:04.748
He's a good friend of mine called Nim
who happens to be homeless.

18:04.792 --> 18:07.261
He's not staying here, is he?

18:07.313 --> 18:12.752
Oh, right, I take it you'd prefer to see him out
on the street? You know, brush "them" away.

18:12.794 --> 18:14.705
Hose them down, put them into camps.
Is that the idea?

18:14.754 --> 18:17.143
No, of course it isn't.

18:17.194 --> 18:20.232
Yes, he's going to stay here,
unless you want him to freeze to death,

18:20.275 --> 18:22.948
or is that exactly what you want?

18:22.995 --> 18:26.306
No!
Look, he must have some benefits or something?

18:26.356 --> 18:31.795
As a matter of fact, he doesn't.
Some bloody guy ripped up his forms, apparently.

18:31.837 --> 18:33.634
Why on earth would they do that?

18:33.677 --> 18:39.071
I don't know, Mark.
I guess that's just the way life is on the streets.

18:40.478 --> 18:43.630
Listen, Nim, I feel awful,

18:43.679 --> 18:46.557
but, the thing is, my dad's coming to stay

18:46.599 --> 18:51.037
and he considers
Sir David Frost to be something of a hippy.

18:51.080 --> 18:53.230
So you're going to have to leave.

18:53.280 --> 18:57.035
I'm sorry. I wouldn't normally do this.

18:57.081 --> 19:01.917
I mean, I have a standing order
to the Royal National Lifeboat Institute.

19:01.962 --> 19:04.476
That's the kind of guy I am.

19:04.522 --> 19:08.152
Maybe you can take some comfort from that?

19:13.364 --> 19:16.674
'God, she's gorgeous! This is killing me.

19:16.724 --> 19:20.843
'Maybe I can rub myself against her,
say I'm doing "an experiment".

19:20.885 --> 19:24.720
'No, too pathetic. OK. Here goes.'

19:24.766 --> 19:27.405
<i>'The nuclear option. The ultimate.'</i>

19:29.246 --> 19:32.205
So, Nancy. I just wanted to say

19:32.247 --> 19:35.364
how much I'm enjoying not having sex with you.

19:35.407 --> 19:36.727
Really?

19:36.768 --> 19:37.837
Yeah.

19:37.888 --> 19:40.118
'Come on, Jez. Death or glory! '

19:40.168 --> 19:45.368
In fact, I was going to propose
that we should probably never have sex again.

19:45.409 --> 19:48.800
I mean, all that humping and pumping...

19:48.850 --> 19:51.364
We could take all that wasted energy

19:51.410 --> 19:55.609
and try and accomplish
so many more important things.

19:55.651 --> 19:58.927
Well, yeah... I mean, that's great, Jez,

19:58.971 --> 20:03.841
but I really wanted this to bring us,
you know, closer together.

20:03.892 --> 20:08.409
Oh, but it has. I feel incredibly close to you...

20:09.493 --> 20:12.804
without any pressure to be sexual.

20:14.494 --> 20:16.405
I mean, these.

20:16.454 --> 20:21.575
I mean, they're just a pair of human breasts,
for Christ's sakes.

20:21.615 --> 20:24.289
Now I can finally appreciate your whole body

20:24.336 --> 20:28.773
without any stupid sexual desire.

20:28.816 --> 20:32.605
Well, yeah... I mean, celibacy, that's great,

20:32.657 --> 20:37.015
but maybe it's all just a bit of naughty Nancy.

20:37.058 --> 20:39.208
Nancy can't have fun.

20:39.258 --> 20:44.174
Nancy must be punished.
Maybe I should just say "Fuck you, Mom!"

20:44.219 --> 20:46.449
'Oh, yeah! Take that, God!

20:46.499 --> 20:49.458
'Shove this up your toga, you big beardie killjoy! '

20:54.421 --> 20:56.457
Hey, where's Nim?

20:56.501 --> 20:57.490
Oh, Nim's gone.

20:57.541 --> 20:58.656
Where?

20:58.702 --> 21:00.499
He's fine. Mark chucked him out.

21:00.542 --> 21:04.217
Jesus, Jeremy! Poor Nim! Where exactly is Nim?

21:04.262 --> 21:08.654
Oh, Nim, Nim, Nim, Nim, Nim... fucking Nim!

21:08.703 --> 21:12.902
Look, if you love Nim so much,
why don't you go and find him and screw him!

21:12.944 --> 21:14.662
OK. Fine.

21:14.704 --> 21:16.821
I will go and try and find Nim.

21:16.865 --> 21:20.414
You know, just to make sure he's not,
like, I don't know, dead or something!

21:20.465 --> 21:22.536
Oh, Nancy, I'm sorry.

21:22.586 --> 21:24.941
I didn't mean it. Come back!

21:26.866 --> 21:30.143
Oh, please? I'm dying here.

21:30.187 --> 21:32.701
Just... touch it!

21:32.747 --> 21:34.704
Blow on it!

21:34.748 --> 21:37.421
You can use a tea towel.

21:40.869 --> 21:45.181
Soph, I just wanted to say, if we do end up
going up the Highlands together

21:45.229 --> 21:49.462
I not only expect,
but will insist on separate rooms because...

21:49.510 --> 21:52.628
- Mark?
- Alan!

21:54.471 --> 21:58.181
It's not what it looks like! It's only a pint.

21:58.232 --> 22:02.066
Only a p! It's never only a pint.

22:02.112 --> 22:05.344
I didn't even want it. Sophie bought it for me.
I asked for a Coke.

22:05.393 --> 22:06.542
No, you didn't.

22:06.593 --> 22:10.348
You know what I'm hearing, Mark? "Poor me!"

22:10.394 --> 22:13.192
"Poor me. Pour me another drink."

22:13.234 --> 22:14.872
No. Alan!

22:14.914 --> 22:19.113
This is bullshit, Mark! And you can forget
about the two weeks in Aberdeen.

22:19.155 --> 22:21.794
Two words. Mini. Bar.

22:24.396 --> 22:29.346
'Ugh! Kaliber! Of course, Kaliber!
Why didn't I say it was Kaliber?

22:29.397 --> 22:31.706
'Kaliber would have made everything all right.'

22:35.678 --> 22:39.591
'OK, I'm going to Aberdeen. I'm going, Jeff.

22:39.638 --> 22:43.678
'In a canoe made of your skin,
wearing your nuts as earrings.'

22:43.719 --> 22:48.191
- All right, Jeff?
- All right, Mark.

22:48.240 --> 22:52.712
So, say, tell you what, Jeff.
I had a great shag last night.

22:52.761 --> 22:54.638
Oh. Really?

22:54.681 --> 22:56.831
Yeah. With your mum.

22:56.881 --> 22:58.440
What?

22:58.482 --> 23:01.474
Yeah, really doing it, we were.

23:01.522 --> 23:05.755
Mate, I know you're pissed off about me
going to Aberdeen with Soph and everything,

23:05.803 --> 23:07.919
but you need to chill, OK?

23:07.963 --> 23:12.355
- You need to chill right out, otherwise...
- What's gonna happen, you homo?!

23:12.404 --> 23:13.996
Mark.

23:14.044 --> 23:19.722
Stolen any good cars lately, Mr Scouser?
Where's your native wit now, ey, Mr Stupid?

23:19.765 --> 23:20.754
Watch it, mate.

23:20.805 --> 23:25.755
Come on, Jeff. Let's get down to it, shall we?
Come on, you stupid stinking chicken fucker.

23:28.487 --> 23:33.801
Ooh, those chickens really love it
when that big rooster Jeff comes a-calling.

23:33.848 --> 23:35.566
Argh!

23:35.608 --> 23:38.361
'He's bloody broken my beautiful nose! '

23:41.129 --> 23:45.760
That should be more than enough for Personnel
to go on, don't you think? Goodbye, Jeff!

23:45.810 --> 23:46.526
What, mate?

23:46.570 --> 23:48.959
Where's the other one?

23:49.010 --> 23:51.684
You're not the one I bought the lager for.

23:51.731 --> 23:53.642
Laurie knocks off at six.

23:53.851 --> 23:58.846
But he was supposed to tape
me and Jeff in the room. He must have taped it.

23:58.892 --> 24:00.644
Oh, shit!

24:00.692 --> 24:04.766
Look, mate, pal. You've got to do me a favour.

24:05.853 --> 24:07.127
Hey, Jeff.

24:07.173 --> 24:09.165
What now, Mark?

24:09.214 --> 24:12.126
Yeah, so, like I was saying. Your mum.

24:12.174 --> 24:14.483
I had sex with her.

24:14.534 --> 24:15.888
Mark, why are you doing this to yourself?

24:15.935 --> 24:17.687
Yeah, and it was great.

24:17.735 --> 24:20.203
Mark, go home.

24:20.255 --> 24:22.645
Come on, you big pussy!

24:23.736 --> 24:28.208
Look, you've obviously got
a lot of serious... stuff going on

24:28.257 --> 24:30.088
and I'm not going to make it any worse.

24:30.137 --> 24:32.606
Come on, dick cheese!

24:32.658 --> 24:35.491
Piss teeth! Fish lips! Come on!

24:35.538 --> 24:41.375
Have another crack at me, Jeff!
Go on, I'll fight back this time! Hit me, Jeff!

24:41.419 --> 24:47.017
'It's OK. I'll get him at the bus stop.
There's CCTV at the bus stop.'
