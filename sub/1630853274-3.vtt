WEBVTT

00:04.091 --> 00:06.397
President Nixon asked for me.

00:06.528 --> 00:08.965
We got a kinda
special opportunity for you.

00:09.096 --> 00:11.576
Now, there's a CIA reject
named Howard Hunt

00:11.707 --> 00:15.102
currently graduating
from rooting out leaks

00:15.232 --> 00:16.799
to, uh,
rat-fuckin' the Democrats.

00:16.929 --> 00:20.411
We must become snakes.

00:21.543 --> 00:22.587
I don't think I can make it
to see you this weekend.

00:22.718 --> 00:24.372
I'll talk to you soon.

00:24.459 --> 00:27.940
Winnie, I decided long ago
that I will say how I feel,

00:28.071 --> 00:29.290
and if that does not conform

00:29.420 --> 00:31.422
to the president's message,
so be it.

00:31.509 --> 00:33.033
You reading poetry now?

00:33.163 --> 00:34.556
I'm in a bit
of a wistful mood, I guess,

00:34.686 --> 00:36.993
thinking about a-a boy
I once knew.

00:37.124 --> 00:39.517
And once in a while,
you still wonder

00:39.604 --> 00:40.779
what it might have been like

00:40.910 --> 00:43.695
if you had stayed
in Pine Bluff.

00:43.826 --> 00:46.002
Mr. McCord, my family and I,
we are traveling out

00:46.089 --> 00:48.091
to California for a fundraiser.

00:48.222 --> 00:49.919
I was wondering if you would
like to accompany us there.

00:50.050 --> 00:51.834
I would love to, Mrs. Mitchell,

00:51.964 --> 00:54.793
but the campaign
does have me very busy.

00:54.924 --> 00:58.275
It seems there was a mix-up
at the Watergate!

00:58.406 --> 00:59.624
-The lobby.
-Get out now.

00:59.711 --> 01:02.105
A-a door
was taped incorrectly.

01:02.236 --> 01:04.412
McCord did not get away.

01:04.542 --> 01:06.109
You really think
that when Martha sees his face

01:06.240 --> 01:07.806
in the newspaper,
she won't call

01:07.937 --> 01:08.981
one of her journalist friends?

01:09.112 --> 01:10.374
Where is everyone?

01:10.505 --> 01:11.897
Mr. Mitchell had to fly
to Washington.

01:11.984 --> 01:13.551
His instructions
were to have you wait here.

01:13.638 --> 01:14.987
This is ridiculous.
I am calling my husband.

01:17.816 --> 01:19.122
You are not in charge here.

01:19.253 --> 01:20.776
-Do you understand me?
-Mm-hmm.

01:27.826 --> 01:30.264
Martha, what'd they
do to you, sweetheart?

01:32.440 --> 01:34.006
If you don't tell me
what them girls did,

01:34.094 --> 01:35.182
I can't do a thing
to help you.

01:36.661 --> 01:38.098
They told me I was trash.

01:40.012 --> 01:42.363
Mm-hmm. Why'd they say that?

01:46.062 --> 01:47.107
Junebug.

01:50.066 --> 01:51.633
They said my daddy runs around.

01:53.939 --> 01:55.724
You believe 'em?

01:59.162 --> 02:00.859
Hmm.

02:00.990 --> 02:04.254
Then you tried to run off,
and...

02:04.385 --> 02:05.342
they chase you down.

02:06.996 --> 02:08.128
Beat you up.

02:10.652 --> 02:11.957
They spat on me.

02:16.484 --> 02:17.876
My poor little girl.

02:23.012 --> 02:24.187
Hey, I want to show you
something.

02:26.929 --> 02:29.671
When your
great-great-grandfather

02:29.801 --> 02:31.281
left England
for South Carolina,

02:31.368 --> 02:34.371
he was given this timepiece

02:34.502 --> 02:37.635
as a traveling gift
from his cousin.

02:40.160 --> 02:41.465
Now, you know
who his cousin was?

02:45.382 --> 02:48.429
King George III of England.

02:51.040 --> 02:53.303
From your
great-great-grandfather

02:53.434 --> 02:54.957
to your grandfather

02:55.087 --> 02:57.612
to you and me,

02:57.699 --> 03:00.615
the Bealls are descended
from nobility.

03:02.617 --> 03:03.792
Hmm?

03:03.922 --> 03:06.534
That makes you a princess,

03:06.664 --> 03:09.014
your mother a queen,

03:09.145 --> 03:11.930
and me?

03:12.061 --> 03:13.193
A king.

03:15.934 --> 03:17.849
So next time
somebody tries to treat you

03:17.980 --> 03:19.808
like you're nothing,

03:19.938 --> 03:21.331
you fight back.

03:23.115 --> 03:26.031
'Cause your blood,
it's worth fighting for.

03:27.990 --> 03:30.384
Yes, sir.

03:30.514 --> 03:32.734
Oh, and one more thing.

03:32.864 --> 03:36.085
Any of them girls ever tries
to touch you again,

03:36.216 --> 03:38.261
take one of their fingers.

03:38.348 --> 03:42.309
Pull it back... 'til it pops.

03:44.180 --> 03:47.705
They'll likely
pee themselves...

03:47.836 --> 03:49.403
or run away.

04:35.449 --> 04:36.276
Hello?

04:37.886 --> 04:40.497
She's doing just fine.

04:40.584 --> 04:43.848
I'm keeping her away
from phones and newspapers.

04:43.979 --> 04:47.069
No, Steve's out sick,
but Barry's here with me.

04:47.199 --> 04:48.897
Of course.
Oh, she's very comfortable.

04:49.027 --> 04:49.811
Thank you.

05:11.789 --> 05:12.399
Excuse me.

05:14.183 --> 05:17.404
-Miss? Excuse me.

05:17.491 --> 05:19.362
Mrs. Mitchell, is everything
all right in there?

05:19.493 --> 05:20.668
Excuse me.

05:20.798 --> 05:22.539
-Ma'am?

05:25.803 --> 05:27.457
Mrs. Mitchell, unlock the door.

05:27.588 --> 05:29.590
My God. Excuse me!

05:29.720 --> 05:30.678
-Mrs. Mitchell...
-Hola!

05:30.808 --> 05:32.070
...if you don't unlock
this door,

05:32.201 --> 05:33.115
I'll have no choice
but to break it down.

05:33.202 --> 05:34.725
Miss, I need h--

05:38.425 --> 05:39.991
No, no, no!

05:40.122 --> 05:41.253
-Ma'am?

05:46.433 --> 05:48.609
What in heaven's name
are you doing?

05:48.739 --> 05:50.959
-Why didn't you answer me?

05:51.089 --> 05:53.875
Because I'm not
a trained parakeet.

05:53.962 --> 05:55.790
But if you're gonna
keep me caged up like one,

05:55.920 --> 05:57.182
the least you could do
is get me something to eat.

06:02.144 --> 06:03.363
I'll send someone out.

06:41.923 --> 06:43.533
Don't let him push you around.

06:43.664 --> 06:45.840
You got this.

06:45.970 --> 06:48.451
-You're an animal.

06:48.582 --> 06:51.541
You're a fuckin' animal.
It's fuck or get fucked.

06:51.672 --> 06:53.543
Hey, Dean, where's
that coffee at, sweetheart?

06:53.674 --> 06:55.545
Yup, yup.
One pot of hot joe coming up.

06:58.330 --> 06:59.506
All right.

07:05.816 --> 07:07.122
Took you long enough.

07:07.252 --> 07:08.428
You know you're supposed
to brew the coffee,

07:08.558 --> 07:09.777
not fuck it, right?

07:11.692 --> 07:14.956
Goddamn cocksucking thing.

07:15.086 --> 07:16.174
Something the matter, sir?

07:16.305 --> 07:17.741
Yeah, it's these
goddamn pipe stems.

07:17.872 --> 07:19.961
I never know
which one goes with which.

07:20.091 --> 07:22.224
Martha's got a whole system,
and--

07:22.354 --> 07:24.095
God damn it.

07:24.226 --> 07:26.620
How's she doing
in California, sir?

07:26.750 --> 07:27.534
I'm sure she's having

07:27.664 --> 07:29.405
a little party down there.

07:29.536 --> 07:32.321
So here's where we're at.

07:32.452 --> 07:36.847
We got five little Indians
under arrest at Metro booking.

07:36.978 --> 07:38.632
That includes
McCord and the Cubans, right?

07:38.762 --> 07:40.329
Bingo was his name-o.

07:40.460 --> 07:42.505
Now, miraculously,
Liddy and Hunt

07:42.636 --> 07:44.072
managed to avoid capture

07:44.202 --> 07:45.334
without falling
into an open sewer,

07:45.465 --> 07:47.728
so we're aces on that front.

07:47.858 --> 07:51.558
And they covered their tracks,
mostly.

07:51.688 --> 07:53.516
Mostly?

07:53.647 --> 07:57.302
Well, there is still the small,
uh, issue of Hunt's safe.

07:57.389 --> 08:00.871
-Wh--you had a safe?
-Yeah.

08:01.002 --> 08:03.134
Yeah, in my office at the
White House, I had a safe.

08:03.265 --> 08:05.702
You were, uh, conducting, uh,

08:05.789 --> 08:07.312
criminal operations
on behalf of the president

08:07.399 --> 08:09.401
and somebody gave you an office
at the White House?

08:09.532 --> 08:11.621
Yeah. Wasn't a big office.

08:11.752 --> 08:13.405
Well, what's in it, the safe?

08:13.536 --> 08:14.276
Well, let's just say
there's some--

08:14.406 --> 08:17.061
you know, some highly...

08:17.192 --> 08:19.411
secretive documents
I r-really wouldn't want,

08:19.542 --> 08:22.458
uh, the light of day to see,
know what I mean?

08:22.589 --> 08:23.938
What do you mean by that?
Can you elaborate?

08:24.068 --> 08:25.330
All right, all right,
so you just need

08:25.461 --> 08:27.071
to give us the combination.

08:27.202 --> 08:27.985
-Then we can get somebody...
-Can't. Can't.

08:28.116 --> 08:29.378
...to go over there,
empty it out.

08:29.509 --> 08:30.684
Can't.
Don't know the combination.

08:30.814 --> 08:32.120
How do you not know
the combination?

08:32.207 --> 08:34.122
Because I forgot it.

08:34.252 --> 08:35.732
-Oh, you forgot it?
-Yes, I forgot it.

08:35.863 --> 08:37.125
I don't have a good memory
when it comes to combinations

08:37.255 --> 08:38.953
or, you know, those things.

08:39.083 --> 08:40.084
Fuck! I mean what the fuck?

08:40.215 --> 08:41.259
Calm down.

08:41.390 --> 08:42.739
We'll just handle it
another way.

08:42.870 --> 08:44.480
It's, like,
two-two-five-six-six or--

08:44.611 --> 08:46.221
Two-two-five.

08:46.351 --> 08:48.179
No. That's not it.
That's my daughter's birthday.

08:48.310 --> 08:49.006
You don't want that.

08:50.965 --> 08:52.096
Okay. Can't we just--can't we
just blow it up?

08:52.227 --> 08:53.620
How hard is it
to blow up a safe?

08:53.750 --> 08:55.535
Uh, if I may interject
as a-a small point, sir,

08:55.622 --> 08:56.492
this is all beginning
to sound a lot

08:56.579 --> 08:58.233
like destruction of evidence.

08:58.320 --> 08:59.451
One-six-one-zero-eight-three.

08:59.539 --> 09:01.279
You're making it sound
so serious.

09:01.410 --> 09:03.499
No, no.
That's the golden ratio.

09:03.630 --> 09:05.022
-Uh, d--
-The golden ratio?

09:05.153 --> 09:06.807
Don't we have guys who can--
who can take care

09:06.937 --> 09:08.983
of this kind of stuff,
you know--

09:09.113 --> 09:11.942
-What? Crime guys?
-You're looking at 'em.

09:12.029 --> 09:15.163
Oh, I know.
It's seven-six-six-four-four.

09:15.293 --> 09:16.817
Seven-seven-six-four-four.

09:16.947 --> 09:19.167
No, no. That's D-Day.
That's not it.

09:19.297 --> 09:21.212
I don't know what the--
I don't know.

09:21.343 --> 09:22.823
All right, this is bullshit.
Hunt should just do it.

09:22.953 --> 09:24.128
It's his safe, for Pete's sake.

09:24.259 --> 09:25.216
No. Fuck no.

09:25.347 --> 09:26.435
I don't want that dipshit

09:26.566 --> 09:27.958
or his psychotic friend

09:28.089 --> 09:30.221
anywhere near
the White House ever again.

09:30.308 --> 09:31.745
No offense, son.

09:31.875 --> 09:33.660
No. God no. None taken, sir.

09:33.790 --> 09:35.575
Well, we've gotta stop
farting around here,

09:35.705 --> 09:37.402
fellas, and get real.

09:37.489 --> 09:39.666
Unless we want to be
on the business end

09:39.796 --> 09:41.537
of an investigative committee
before Christmas,

09:41.668 --> 09:43.583
one of us has to get
that goddamn safe

09:43.713 --> 09:44.714
out of the White House.

10:00.034 --> 10:02.253
Oh, no, no, no.
No, I couldn't do it.

10:02.384 --> 10:04.604
I-I'm-I'm too close
to the president.

10:29.977 --> 10:31.543
Here's the file,
Agent Lano.

10:38.246 --> 10:39.377
Special Agent Lano.

10:39.508 --> 10:40.291
Yeah?

10:42.772 --> 10:45.166
Ah, gracias, amigo.

10:45.253 --> 10:46.341
Appreciate it, bud.

10:51.433 --> 10:53.261
He's a big guy, isn't he?

10:53.348 --> 10:54.349
What?

10:54.436 --> 10:55.742
He's a big guy.

10:55.872 --> 10:57.657
Yeah. He's, uh, very solid.

10:59.963 --> 11:02.618
-So you want to go in or--
-Yeah, I plan to.

11:02.749 --> 11:05.403
Just, uh, waiting on the agent
on assignment.

11:05.490 --> 11:06.578
He's running a little late.

11:13.585 --> 11:14.717
You're the agent?

11:14.848 --> 11:17.502
-That's right.
-Oh, fuck. Fuck.

11:17.633 --> 11:20.288
I'm sorry.
Uh, this isn't because you're--

11:20.418 --> 11:22.377
No, of-of course not.
Please keep it.

11:22.507 --> 11:24.553
-You sure?
-I insist.

11:24.684 --> 11:26.947
I'm sorry, yeah, ma--
uh, it makes sense

11:27.077 --> 11:31.038
because we're dealing
with a Cuban burglar,

11:31.168 --> 11:32.735
so they would send a,
you know--

11:37.044 --> 11:39.437
-Mm-hmm.
-What's your name again?

11:39.524 --> 11:41.744
Agent Paul Magallanes, sir,
reporting for duty.

11:42.397 --> 11:44.573
-"Maggy-anus"?
-Magallanes.

11:44.704 --> 11:46.706
"Maga-yah-nez, yah-nez."

11:46.793 --> 11:48.708
-Magallanes.
-Say it slow.

11:48.838 --> 11:50.361
You can just call me Paul.

11:50.492 --> 11:51.885
-Paul.
-Yes.

11:52.015 --> 11:54.539
Angelo Lano.
Pleasure to meet you.

11:54.670 --> 11:55.845
I didn't know they sent feds

11:55.976 --> 11:58.282
to investigate
routine burglaries.

11:58.413 --> 11:59.501
I'm afraid
it's standard procedure

11:59.631 --> 12:01.503
when foreign nationals
are involved.

12:01.633 --> 12:03.026
Cigarette, Mr. McCord?

12:03.157 --> 12:04.027
No, thanks.

12:04.158 --> 12:05.855
Now, Mr. McCord,

12:05.942 --> 12:08.205
you said in your statement
that you personally hired

12:08.336 --> 12:12.079
the Cubans--Gonzalez, Martinez,
Sturgis, Barker--

12:12.209 --> 12:15.299
to help you rob DNC
headquarters at the Watergate.

12:16.300 --> 12:18.085
It says here that you were
the only contact

12:18.215 --> 12:19.826
for these guys in D.C.

12:19.956 --> 12:22.393
Is-is that--is that correct?

12:22.524 --> 12:24.265
If that's what I said.

12:24.395 --> 12:26.658
It's funny, because...

12:26.789 --> 12:30.053
Barker gave us
this address book,

12:30.140 --> 12:32.664
and a name--
got a lot of names in here,

12:32.795 --> 12:34.579
but one of 'em that stood out,
right here.

12:36.538 --> 12:37.800
HH.

12:37.931 --> 12:39.628
That's a D.C. number.

12:39.759 --> 12:41.282
Recently disconnected.

12:41.369 --> 12:42.718
Ring a bell?

12:42.849 --> 12:44.502
It's like I said.

12:44.633 --> 12:46.548
The whole thing
was my planning,

12:46.678 --> 12:49.159
my execution, my guys.

12:49.290 --> 12:51.901
If you want any more, I'm gonna
need my lawyer present.

12:52.032 --> 12:52.728
All right.

12:54.643 --> 12:55.949
Here's the thing, Mr. McCord.

12:57.515 --> 12:58.995
I think you're full of shit.

12:59.126 --> 13:01.258
I don't think this was
a simple break-in.

13:01.389 --> 13:02.782
I don't think you're nearly
the B&E mastermind

13:02.912 --> 13:04.044
that you claim to be,

13:04.174 --> 13:06.873
especially after hearing
from the Cubans.

13:07.003 --> 13:08.875
The Cubans?

13:08.962 --> 13:10.224
They kept asking
what kind of idiota

13:10.354 --> 13:12.748
tapes a door latch side to side

13:12.879 --> 13:14.228
when everybody knows
you do it vertical

13:14.358 --> 13:16.012
so nobody can see
the tape sticking out.

13:16.143 --> 13:17.144
Well, that's bullshit.

13:19.233 --> 13:22.149
The tape can slip
if it's vertical.

13:26.022 --> 13:27.458
All right.

13:27.545 --> 13:29.199
Listen, amigo,
vertical, sideways,

13:29.330 --> 13:30.940
it doesn't matter to me.

13:31.071 --> 13:32.376
I'm not here to debate
the tape thing with you,

13:32.507 --> 13:34.161
all right?

13:34.291 --> 13:36.598
I am gonna tell you,
you say you were in charge.

13:36.728 --> 13:37.860
The Cubans don't sound like

13:37.947 --> 13:39.470
they respect
their superior too much.

13:39.557 --> 13:42.212
They don't respect me. Ha!

13:42.343 --> 13:45.346
That's a laugh.
Lie down with dogs, I guess.

13:45.433 --> 13:46.913
Lie down with dogs.

13:48.653 --> 13:51.004
You're saying the Cubans...
are dogs.

13:53.223 --> 13:55.356
I'm not sure.
You tell me, amigo.

13:57.227 --> 13:58.881
That racist piece of shit.

13:59.012 --> 14:01.057
He wouldn't hire those Cubans
to paint his goddamn house.

14:01.188 --> 14:02.885
I don't see him being
in charge of this, do you?

14:02.972 --> 14:03.886
Whatever it is, these guys

14:03.973 --> 14:05.714
are five steps ahead of us.

14:05.845 --> 14:07.150
Maybe they're CIA.

14:07.281 --> 14:08.848
Maybe it's like those bombings
in New York,

14:08.978 --> 14:10.240
like, an anti-Castro thing.

14:10.371 --> 14:13.026
Big bankroll. Dry runs.
Lookouts.

14:14.549 --> 14:16.725
-Lookouts?
-Worth a shot.

14:22.513 --> 14:23.775
Lunch is served.

14:40.618 --> 14:42.490
Your foie gras, madam.

14:54.328 --> 14:55.851
Thought you were hungry.

14:55.982 --> 14:57.635
Seems to have faded.

15:02.075 --> 15:03.119
Nice watch.

15:05.382 --> 15:06.644
It's a family heirloom.

15:06.775 --> 15:08.255
Was a gift
from the king of England.

15:08.385 --> 15:10.083
No kidding.

15:10.213 --> 15:12.476
My father gave it to me.

15:12.607 --> 15:14.652
Passed away when I was young.

15:14.783 --> 15:15.740
Sorry to hear that.

15:20.702 --> 15:22.486
Why you doing this?

15:22.617 --> 15:24.836
-Doing what?
-Keeping me here,

15:24.924 --> 15:27.187
participating in this
callous enterprise.

15:27.317 --> 15:30.016
You don't seem like a sadist
or a psychopath.

15:30.146 --> 15:31.495
That's sweet of you to say.

15:33.062 --> 15:34.281
What would your wife say

15:34.411 --> 15:35.456
if she knew you were
holding me prisoner?

15:37.066 --> 15:38.850
Probably tell me
to be home by dinner.

15:40.548 --> 15:41.810
Well, that's very sad.

15:47.598 --> 15:49.339
I sleep fine at night, lady,

15:49.470 --> 15:50.732
because I know my place

15:50.862 --> 15:52.429
in this whole
messy enterprise of ours.

15:52.560 --> 15:54.692
People like you?

15:54.823 --> 15:57.869
Oh, you have the luxury of
pretending you're above it all.

15:58.000 --> 16:02.091
It's other people who have to
sacrifice for Nixon's vision,

16:02.222 --> 16:03.484
but when it's your turn
to pitch in,

16:03.614 --> 16:05.529
when the gun's turned on you,

16:05.660 --> 16:07.140
it's suddenly a tragedy.

16:09.620 --> 16:12.493
You're very cruel, aren't you?

16:12.623 --> 16:13.668
And you're a hypocrite.

16:17.628 --> 16:18.803
Spare a cigarette?

16:21.893 --> 16:22.982
They're not menthol.

16:24.853 --> 16:26.376
Beggars can't be choosers.

16:37.431 --> 16:38.475
Thank you.

16:40.086 --> 16:40.825
You're welcome.

16:46.918 --> 16:48.181
Barry!

16:48.311 --> 16:49.921
Barry, get a doctor
up here now!

16:51.575 --> 16:53.621
It's only a second-degree burn,

16:53.751 --> 16:55.797
so it should heal up soon.

16:55.927 --> 16:58.060
You're lucky that, uh,

16:58.191 --> 16:59.888
your friend was here
to help you.

17:00.019 --> 17:02.282
No, please.
You need to help me.

17:02.412 --> 17:04.980
The-the situation
is not as it appears.

17:05.111 --> 17:07.678
I know all about
your situation.

17:07.765 --> 17:09.550
It's nothing to be
embarrassed about.

17:09.637 --> 17:13.075
A lot of women your age
suffer from paranoid episodes.

17:13.162 --> 17:15.121
No, no, no.
You don't understand.

17:17.166 --> 17:18.907
I'm being held against my will.

17:19.038 --> 17:21.562
They've cut the cord
on my phone.

17:21.692 --> 17:23.912
Maybe a little time away
from your telephone

17:24.043 --> 17:25.870
would do you good,
Mrs. Mitchell.

17:26.001 --> 17:29.396
Maybe that's just
what you need right now.

17:35.924 --> 17:37.708
Yes.

17:37.839 --> 17:39.406
That's right. Thank you.

17:44.628 --> 17:48.719
Could you, uh, get me a glass
of water before you go?

17:48.806 --> 17:50.895
-Oh, absolutely.
-Thank you.

17:54.203 --> 17:55.117
How is she?

17:55.204 --> 17:56.814
Her delusions will pass.

17:56.945 --> 17:59.382
Until then, be sure
to keep an eye on her.

17:59.469 --> 18:00.731
Don't worry.
I'll take good care of her.

18:07.564 --> 18:08.652
I can't believe they trusted
Hunt with an office,

18:08.739 --> 18:09.871
let alone a safe.

18:10.001 --> 18:11.786
Fucking Mitchell.

18:12.613 --> 18:15.268
-I know why he's doing this.
-Hmm.

18:15.355 --> 18:16.095
He's jealous
the president likes me.

18:17.618 --> 18:19.707
Wants to keep Nixon
all for himself.

18:19.837 --> 18:21.665
You're talking about him
like he's David Cassidy.

18:21.752 --> 18:22.884
-John Dean's office.

18:23.014 --> 18:24.799
Check the handle.
The GSA cracked it.

18:24.886 --> 18:27.454
-They cracked it?

18:27.584 --> 18:29.195
Mr. Dean, I have
your mechanic on the line.

18:29.325 --> 18:30.413
Oh, great.

18:31.632 --> 18:33.503
This is John Dean.

18:33.590 --> 18:35.114
Uh-huh.

18:35.244 --> 18:36.506
The transmission? Really?

18:36.637 --> 18:38.421
Well, uh,
when can I get her in?

18:38.552 --> 18:40.206
What? Next month?

18:40.293 --> 18:44.210
Well, can't I pay
a-a rush fee or something?

18:44.340 --> 18:46.342
Ugh. Fine.

18:48.083 --> 18:49.302
Oh, God damn it.

18:51.217 --> 18:52.870
Fucking Porsche.

18:53.001 --> 18:54.872
I finally talked Mo
into coming back to D.C.,

18:55.003 --> 18:57.136
and she's just been sitting
around my house waiting for me.

18:57.266 --> 18:59.573
Well, I hate to make things
worse for you here, boss,

18:59.703 --> 19:01.140
but I think possession
of this safe alone

19:01.270 --> 19:02.532
is grounds for treason.

19:02.663 --> 19:05.187
I mean, this appears
to be a CIA cable

19:05.318 --> 19:07.058
directly implicating Kennedy
in the Bay of Pigs.

19:07.189 --> 19:09.017
What? Give me that.

19:09.148 --> 19:11.585
-Mr. Dean's office.

19:11.672 --> 19:14.805
Here's a proposal to firebomb
the Brookings Institution.

19:14.936 --> 19:16.590
-What?
-Zany.

19:16.720 --> 19:18.200
Oh!

19:18.287 --> 19:19.375
Not to mention
this little number.

19:19.462 --> 19:20.898
Boom!

19:20.985 --> 19:21.769
Jesus. Put that away.

19:25.599 --> 19:28.036
What the hell?

19:28.167 --> 19:31.300
So Hunt just had this stuff
lying around the office?

19:31.387 --> 19:32.780
But why?

19:32.867 --> 19:33.955
Because he's
the personification

19:34.085 --> 19:35.435
of the rotten core

19:35.565 --> 19:36.914
at the center
of the national myth?

19:37.045 --> 19:37.872
If I get caught
with this stuff,

19:38.002 --> 19:38.873
I could go to prison for years.

19:39.003 --> 19:40.179
Oh, decades, probably.

19:42.572 --> 19:44.487
I swear to God,
John Mitchell's out to get me.

19:44.574 --> 19:46.141
Whoa.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

19:46.228 --> 19:48.970
You're looking at this
all wrong, okay?

19:49.100 --> 19:50.972
This is how you get in
with the president,

19:51.102 --> 19:53.279
okay, because if you take care
of this for him,

19:53.409 --> 19:56.064
he'll know he can trust you,
and he'll owe you one.

19:56.195 --> 19:58.284
So here's what you're gonna do.

19:58.371 --> 19:59.720
You're gonna have a nice night
out with your lady friend,

19:59.850 --> 20:01.939
and then you're gonna find
a big, empty field.

20:02.070 --> 20:03.245
You're gonna burn
all of this shit,

20:03.332 --> 20:04.681
and you're gonna
throw this gun in a lake.

20:04.768 --> 20:07.771
Yeah. Okay.

20:07.902 --> 20:09.773
Okay. Send my best to Mo.

20:31.795 --> 20:33.536
Aw, fuck.

20:35.669 --> 20:37.192
God.

20:48.682 --> 20:49.987
Fuck.

21:04.350 --> 21:05.699
Oh, God. Fuck!

21:07.875 --> 21:08.789
Fuck!

21:11.182 --> 21:12.401
Fuck.

21:12.532 --> 21:13.446
Okay.

21:15.970 --> 21:16.971
Ugh!

21:19.626 --> 21:21.628
-Ugh!

21:21.758 --> 21:23.325
Oh, fuck!

21:34.293 --> 21:36.730
Fuck. Fuck.

21:38.427 --> 21:39.646
-Hey, son.

21:42.170 --> 21:43.998
Son, what the heck
you doing on my property?

21:46.130 --> 21:47.697
You trying to start
a fire out here?

21:47.828 --> 21:49.873
No, no. No.

21:50.004 --> 21:52.746
No, I had car trouble,
and, uh...

21:52.876 --> 21:54.748
and I got lost
and then came out here.

21:54.878 --> 21:56.097
You know,
thought I'd have a-a cigarette,

21:56.227 --> 21:58.229
and-and, uh,

21:58.360 --> 22:00.710
I had...

22:00.841 --> 22:02.059
gasoline.

22:07.935 --> 22:09.806
Oh, fuck.

22:09.937 --> 22:10.720
What the--

22:22.645 --> 22:24.212
Oh, fuck.

23:43.422 --> 23:45.162
Okay. You love Christmas.

23:50.341 --> 23:52.256
-Oh, boy.

24:07.228 --> 24:09.143
Hmm.

24:19.588 --> 24:21.198
Well, this is it.

24:21.329 --> 24:24.375
Okay, son. You take it easy.

24:24.506 --> 24:27.074
Thank you, sir.
I really do appreciate this.

24:27.161 --> 24:29.032
You're very welcome.
See you in the morning.

24:35.125 --> 24:36.605
Where were you?
Who was that?

24:36.692 --> 24:38.477
Hey.

24:38.607 --> 24:41.262
I had a little car trouble,

24:41.392 --> 24:44.091
and this kind gentleman
helped me out.

24:44.178 --> 24:46.006
I'm...

24:46.093 --> 24:48.661
I'm gonna have that fucking
Porsche towed back here.

24:48.791 --> 24:50.053
I'm gonna sell it for scrap.

24:52.795 --> 24:54.144
Let's get you in the shower.

24:54.275 --> 24:55.929
You smell like gasoline.

24:56.059 --> 24:57.278
Did you get
some writing done?

24:57.365 --> 24:59.149
Oh, I almost did,
and then I found

24:59.236 --> 25:00.934
this "Fuck Communism" sign.

25:01.064 --> 25:02.370
Oh, yeah,
that's pretty neat, isn't it?

25:02.501 --> 25:03.980
You like that? I had that
specially commissioned.

25:04.111 --> 25:05.068
I do like it.

27:27.341 --> 27:28.516
All right, well,
then what would you call it?

27:28.647 --> 27:31.214
-Well, it's Nixon shock.

27:31.345 --> 27:33.652
So, Winnie, what's it like
on the Martha Mitchell beat?

27:33.782 --> 27:36.132
Oh, she's really not that bad

27:36.263 --> 27:37.612
once you get to know her,
honestly.

27:37.743 --> 27:39.745
She's a retrograde
segregationist.

27:39.875 --> 27:41.442
If you ask me,
she has blood on her hands.

27:41.572 --> 27:43.226
Exactly, ugh.

27:43.357 --> 27:44.967
I think there's a difference

27:45.054 --> 27:47.448
between being mildly complicit
and being responsible

27:47.578 --> 27:50.016
for the sum evil
of the modern Republican Party.

27:50.146 --> 27:52.409
"Mildly complicit." Oh, dear.

27:54.194 --> 27:56.457
-You need another drink?

27:58.285 --> 28:00.200
No.

28:00.330 --> 28:02.593
Utter her name three times,
and she will appear.

28:02.724 --> 28:04.421
-Okay.

28:04.552 --> 28:06.597
Martha, Martha, Martha!

28:09.122 --> 28:10.950
McLendon residence.

28:11.080 --> 28:12.342
Oh, Winnie.
Thank God you answered.

28:12.473 --> 28:13.474
Martha.

28:15.694 --> 28:18.305
Um, can I call you back later?

28:18.392 --> 28:19.785
I'm-I'm in the middle
of something.

28:19.872 --> 28:21.612
No, no, no, no.
I have no time. I have no time.

28:21.700 --> 28:22.483
I ha--I don't know
what's happening here,

28:22.613 --> 28:23.876
but I'm being held prisoner.

28:24.006 --> 28:25.355
They're holding me here.
They're keeping me here.

28:25.486 --> 28:26.617
Who's keeping you where?

28:26.748 --> 28:28.271
It's got something to do

28:28.402 --> 28:29.664
with this Watergate break-in.
McCord was there.

28:29.795 --> 28:30.621
Read something
about it in the paper.

28:30.752 --> 28:32.493
I don't know what it is,
but just--

28:32.623 --> 28:34.277
Okay, Martha, can you
just slow down, all right?

28:34.408 --> 28:36.453
Start at--start the beginning.
What's happening?

28:36.540 --> 28:38.542
-I j--
-Martha?

28:38.629 --> 28:40.109
-Oh, God.
-Can you hear me?

28:40.240 --> 28:42.068
Get away from me. Winnie?

28:42.155 --> 28:43.678
-Hello!
-Get away from me.

28:43.809 --> 28:45.419
-Hand me the phone.
-I--

28:45.506 --> 28:46.855
-Get away from me!
-Martha!

28:46.986 --> 28:48.117
No! Please get away from me!

28:48.248 --> 28:50.206
-No!
-Ma--

28:53.122 --> 28:54.602
-Barry! Get her!

28:56.256 --> 28:58.867
-Mrs. Mitchell--

28:58.998 --> 29:01.000
-No! No! Let me go!
-Calm down.

29:01.130 --> 29:03.350
Get off of me! Leave me alone!

29:03.437 --> 29:05.831
-Get off me!

29:05.961 --> 29:07.049
Mrs. Mitchell,
calm down!

29:23.936 --> 29:25.546
Mrs. Mitchell.

29:25.676 --> 29:29.724
You're okay. You're okay.

29:29.855 --> 29:31.944
Give me your hand.

29:32.074 --> 29:34.424
-Let me help you.

29:34.555 --> 29:36.122
Here, here. It's okay.

29:36.252 --> 29:36.992
It's okay.
I'm not gonna hurt you.

29:37.123 --> 29:37.906
Give me your hand.

29:42.693 --> 29:45.435
-Ah! God damn it!

29:45.566 --> 29:48.438
You broke my fucking finger,
you bitch!

29:53.748 --> 29:55.315
Get my bag. It's there.

29:55.445 --> 29:57.621
Don't fucking move.

29:57.708 --> 30:00.233
Please!
Please don't hurt me anymore.

30:00.320 --> 30:03.149
Please. Please.

30:03.279 --> 30:06.892
I'm sorry. Please.

30:07.022 --> 30:08.763
I promise I'll be quiet.
Please. I'm sorry.

30:08.850 --> 30:10.765
I'm sorry. I'll be quiet.

30:12.593 --> 30:14.290
Hurry up.

30:16.727 --> 30:17.990
Please don't. Please--

30:39.620 --> 30:44.451
Oh, fuck. Oh, God. Yeah.

30:44.581 --> 30:46.714
-John.
-Almost. I'm just--oh, God.

30:46.801 --> 30:47.671
Fuck.

30:52.415 --> 30:53.547
-Uh...
-Yeah?

30:53.677 --> 30:54.940
-...necklace.
-Oh, sorry.

30:55.070 --> 30:56.463
-It's just--
-That's okay.

30:56.593 --> 30:57.943
No, wait.

30:58.073 --> 30:59.814
I can--I-I can get it back.

30:59.945 --> 31:01.424
It's--oh, shit.
Is it out? Fuck.

31:01.555 --> 31:03.078
We can just--it's-it's--

31:03.209 --> 31:04.340
Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.

31:04.471 --> 31:06.777
Oh, my God. Jesus Christ.

31:06.908 --> 31:08.257
-Ugh.
-It's okay.

31:11.086 --> 31:14.307
Every woman dreams of a man
who'll go for a full hour...

31:14.437 --> 31:15.786
and a half.

31:15.917 --> 31:16.787
I'm sorry.

31:17.658 --> 31:18.572
Oh fuck.

31:21.880 --> 31:22.837
I'm gonna go
make myself a drink.

31:22.924 --> 31:24.491
No.

31:24.621 --> 31:25.666
I need to get
some writing done.

31:25.796 --> 31:27.059
-Wait. No.
-You know what? I know.

31:27.189 --> 31:29.539
I know what's
going on here, okay?

31:29.626 --> 31:32.107
It's clearly--you-you-you
stood me up last week,

31:32.238 --> 31:33.717
and you begged me
to come to D.C., and now...

31:33.848 --> 31:36.329
The president had urgent
business. I told you that.

31:36.459 --> 31:37.939
...when I'm actually here,
your mind is somewhere else.

31:38.026 --> 31:40.246
I mean, you made me
take a cab home after dinner

31:40.376 --> 31:41.769
so you could get back
to work, John.

31:41.900 --> 31:43.162
Mo, this is not about you.

31:43.292 --> 31:44.076
That's exactly
what I'm saying.

31:44.163 --> 31:45.338
I know what it feels like

31:45.468 --> 31:46.687
when a man loses interest.

31:46.817 --> 31:48.036
What? No.

31:48.167 --> 31:50.082
This is not me
losing interest.

31:52.998 --> 31:54.956
It's absolutely fine
if you're over it.

31:55.087 --> 31:56.784
I've got other friends in town,
and I-I'm just--

31:56.915 --> 31:57.698
-Wait.
-I'm gonna--

31:57.828 --> 31:59.308
I'm just gonna go out.

31:59.439 --> 32:00.614
Wait.
I don't want you to go out.

32:00.744 --> 32:02.485
How did going out
even come into it?

32:02.572 --> 32:04.574
I would just rather not
do this if it's not real,

32:04.661 --> 32:06.837
-so let's just call it.
-No.

32:06.968 --> 32:08.578
This was fun, this was a fling,
and now it's over.

32:08.709 --> 32:10.363
That's--there's nothing wrong
with that.

32:10.493 --> 32:12.147
I love spending time with you.

32:12.234 --> 32:13.409
You know how many people
I love spending time with?

32:13.540 --> 32:15.411
No people. Zero.

32:15.542 --> 32:17.805
I--look. I know you--yeah.

32:17.936 --> 32:19.589
You're right. I am distracted.

32:19.676 --> 32:21.461
I--there's a lot going on,
and, uh, you know

32:21.591 --> 32:24.377
the-the fucking Porsche shit,
and Dickie Moore

32:24.464 --> 32:26.248
-got in my head today, and--
-What?

32:26.379 --> 32:27.858
Why are you listening
to Dickie Moore?

32:27.989 --> 32:30.470
-He's angling for your job.

32:30.600 --> 32:33.690
You are here now with me.
Can you be here with me?

32:33.821 --> 32:35.475
-Yes.
-I mean, John, please?

32:35.605 --> 32:36.519
I'm sorry. Yes.

32:36.650 --> 32:37.607
-Come on.
-Of course.

32:47.139 --> 32:48.053
Wait, y-you don't think
he's actually

32:48.183 --> 32:49.010
angling for my job, do you?

32:49.141 --> 32:50.403
-Goodbye.
-Wait. What?

32:50.533 --> 32:52.318
You know what?
Why don't you just go

32:52.448 --> 32:54.233
and take care
of whatever this is

32:54.320 --> 32:56.322
that's going on
that you need to take care of?

32:57.366 --> 32:58.933
And hey, don't bother me
until you're ready

32:59.064 --> 33:00.239
to look me in the eye
when you fuck me.

33:00.369 --> 33:01.370
Hey. What?

33:04.373 --> 33:06.941
I made eye contact!

33:08.856 --> 33:10.379
Fuck you.

33:20.911 --> 33:21.782
All right, we got it from here.

33:21.869 --> 33:22.435
-Yup.
-Thank you.

33:48.591 --> 33:49.940
-Hey, Ang?
-Hmm?

33:52.334 --> 33:53.248
Perfect vantage point.

34:09.047 --> 34:12.224
Lakeview Country Club, $6.36.

34:14.704 --> 34:15.836
E. Howard Hunt.

34:18.012 --> 34:19.666
HH.

34:20.710 --> 34:23.409
Uh, let's see.
I got bad eyes here.

34:24.671 --> 34:26.542
Yeah.

34:26.673 --> 34:28.936
Yeah, that certainly does
look like my signature.

34:29.067 --> 34:31.591
So you would say
it's within possibility

34:31.721 --> 34:33.767
that that check belongs
to you, right, Mr. Hunt?

34:35.769 --> 34:37.075
Uh, sorry.
Don't get the relevance.

34:37.205 --> 34:38.902
Well, we sat down

34:38.989 --> 34:40.295
with one of the burglars
this morning,

34:40.426 --> 34:42.515
a Mr. James McCord.

34:42.645 --> 34:43.385
Don't know him.
Never heard of him.

34:43.516 --> 34:44.169
-Never?
-Nope.

34:44.299 --> 34:45.866
Mm.

34:45.996 --> 34:47.607
He was surprisingly candid
about his...

34:47.694 --> 34:49.304
leadership role
in the break-in.

34:49.391 --> 34:51.001
Oh, yeah? Well, that's great.

34:51.132 --> 34:52.873
Then you would get some
information, no doubt, right?

34:53.003 --> 34:55.223
A guy like that with his,

34:55.354 --> 34:57.791
shall we say,
retrograde racial outlook?

34:57.921 --> 34:58.792
There's no way he would have
ever thought

34:58.922 --> 35:00.098
to hire those Cubans.

35:02.012 --> 35:04.319
You got the B team
in with you today.

35:04.450 --> 35:07.279
You know what?

35:07.366 --> 35:09.107
I actually thought
the same thing,

35:09.237 --> 35:11.805
but then I figured,
hey, Italians need work too.

35:11.935 --> 35:14.242
-Terrific.

35:14.373 --> 35:17.289
Anyway, we inferred
that there were

35:17.419 --> 35:19.291
more people involved
in the break-in.

35:19.421 --> 35:22.511
Operational specialists
above McCord's pay grade.

35:22.642 --> 35:24.557
-Pardon me?
-We're talking about lookouts.

35:24.644 --> 35:25.819
Which led us
to the Howard Johnson's

35:25.949 --> 35:27.429
across the street.

35:27.560 --> 35:29.344
Perfect sight line
down to the Watergate.

35:29.431 --> 35:30.998
Front desk clerk
showed us to a room

35:31.129 --> 35:33.131
belonging to a bunch of guys
who checked out in a hurry.

35:33.261 --> 35:34.741
Guess what we found
in the trash can.

35:34.828 --> 35:36.308
Trash.

35:36.438 --> 35:38.527
Found this check
made out by you.

35:38.658 --> 35:40.225
I can't explain that.

35:41.182 --> 35:43.097
It would suggest that
you were across the street

35:43.228 --> 35:44.272
from the Watergate at the time
of the break-in, would it not?

35:44.403 --> 35:46.013
Why would it suggest that?

35:46.144 --> 35:47.754
You can make all the
suggestions you want, but--

35:47.884 --> 35:48.798
-It doesn't?
-No.

35:48.929 --> 35:50.235
-No?
-This?

35:50.322 --> 35:52.367
This is circumstantial.
This means nothing.

35:52.454 --> 35:54.021
So that check
just walked itself in?

35:54.152 --> 35:55.849
-What the fuck?
You could have planted it.

35:55.979 --> 35:57.285
Who-who knows? I don't know.

35:57.416 --> 35:58.417
Are these your kids?

35:58.547 --> 36:00.767
Those are my children, yes.

36:00.897 --> 36:01.942
-All of them?
-All of them.

36:02.072 --> 36:03.552
I--we made them all.

36:03.639 --> 36:06.207
-Both of us. Together.

36:06.338 --> 36:08.166
So what'd you-what'd you
have to eat that night?

36:08.253 --> 36:09.602
-Spaghetti.
-What kind of sauce?

36:09.732 --> 36:11.038
Oh, I know
what he's talking about.

36:11.125 --> 36:12.953
What?

36:13.040 --> 36:14.215
He wants me to admit
to my secret ingredient.

36:14.346 --> 36:16.086
Smoked "pah-pri-kah."

36:16.217 --> 36:18.001
-Oh, for fuck's sake.
-Excuse me?

36:18.088 --> 36:19.351
Hey, hey, hey, hey
With the language.

36:19.438 --> 36:20.874
Mr. Hunt, you were there.

36:21.004 --> 36:22.484
You left your check
at the scene.

36:22.615 --> 36:24.051
Guys, this is
completely circumstantial.

36:24.182 --> 36:25.922
You-you see--
you see these trash cans?

36:26.053 --> 36:28.186
Are you really gonna tell me
that the smoldering trash cans

36:28.316 --> 36:30.492
you got out there, that's not
a textbook evidence fire?

36:30.623 --> 36:32.233
The kids wanted s'mores.

36:32.364 --> 36:33.800
The kids are making
s'mores, for God's sake.

36:33.930 --> 36:36.150
-They're making s'mores.
-In a trash can fire?

36:36.281 --> 36:37.543
Do you have any other
questions for us?

36:37.673 --> 36:38.892
I do have a question.

36:39.022 --> 36:40.241
Can you point me towards,
uh, the restroom, please?

36:40.372 --> 36:41.721
Oh, certainly.

36:41.851 --> 36:42.809
It's just, uh--
it's just down the hallway.

36:42.896 --> 36:44.463
-Okay.
-To your left.

36:44.593 --> 36:46.769
Paprika.
Uh, "pah-pri-kah."

36:46.900 --> 36:47.857
I've never heard it like that.

36:47.988 --> 36:49.424
Don't get lost.

36:49.511 --> 36:50.686
It's a beautiful house.

36:50.817 --> 36:51.861
Thank you.

36:53.428 --> 36:54.560
Oh, these are cute pictures.

36:56.257 --> 36:58.868
All right, let's, um--

36:58.955 --> 37:00.522
let's go over this
one more time.

37:00.609 --> 37:03.221
-You were CIA.
-I was.

37:03.351 --> 37:05.005
And you're telling me that
it would be a stretch to say

37:05.135 --> 37:06.180
that you might have met
these Cubans

37:06.311 --> 37:07.573
sometime around
the Bay of Pigs?

37:07.703 --> 37:09.618
The Bay of what?

37:13.927 --> 37:14.797
Got you.

37:18.061 --> 37:19.498
Thank you so much.

37:19.628 --> 37:20.368
Oh, anything we can do to help.

37:20.499 --> 37:22.022
You're welcome.

37:22.109 --> 37:23.589
-Take care.
-Stop by anytime.

37:23.719 --> 37:24.807
Why are you rushing us out?

37:24.938 --> 37:25.895
I was just getting
my flow in there.

37:26.026 --> 37:27.593
-Liddy.
-What?

37:27.680 --> 37:29.812
-Gordon Liddy.
-Liddy.

37:29.943 --> 37:31.727
You don't know Liddy?
He's-he's a legend.

37:31.814 --> 37:33.512
He's a legendary agent.

37:33.642 --> 37:35.253
Didn't he fire
a nine-millimeter

37:35.383 --> 37:37.298
-in a courtroom once?
-Yes, yes. He's fucking insane.

37:37.429 --> 37:39.039
-Okay, what about him?
-Mm.

37:39.169 --> 37:42.608
Complex mission.
Huge room service bill.

37:42.738 --> 37:44.697
Wait, you're saying Liddy
might be our man on this?

37:48.918 --> 37:50.920
I saw a fucking picture
of him and Hunt in the hallway.

38:20.123 --> 38:23.692
-Shit. Shit, shit, shit! God!

38:23.823 --> 38:25.433
Mr. Liddy?
Need some help in there?

38:25.564 --> 38:27.609
Nope. No, no.
Don't come in here, Judy.

38:27.740 --> 38:30.351
No, no, no, no, no, no!
Not-not--

38:36.444 --> 38:37.880
Thought I told you
never to come in here.

38:38.011 --> 38:39.447
I'm sorry, Mr. Liddy.

38:39.578 --> 38:40.796
Uh, there are two men here
to see you,

38:40.927 --> 38:42.668
uh, from the FBI.

38:45.627 --> 38:46.976
Okay.

39:00.381 --> 39:02.644
Hey, Angelo,

39:02.775 --> 39:05.125
you remember back at Metro,
we were saying

39:05.255 --> 39:07.301
how this has to be
a professional operation,

39:07.432 --> 39:10.304
that these guys gotta be
five steps ahead of us?

39:10.435 --> 39:11.261
Yeah.

39:12.872 --> 39:13.916
What if we're wrong?

39:17.572 --> 39:19.052
What if they're just morons?

39:24.187 --> 39:26.320
Salutations, gentlemen.

39:26.451 --> 39:27.626
I'm G. Gordon Liddy.

39:51.606 --> 39:52.520
Ma'am?

39:57.046 --> 39:58.396
You sure you want to do this?

40:00.485 --> 40:01.660
We-we can turn around
right now.

40:01.790 --> 40:02.748
There ain't no shame in it.

40:06.099 --> 40:08.014
No. I want to see.

40:34.823 --> 40:36.956
Well, well, least
he wasn't on the streets.

40:40.655 --> 40:43.397
It's, uh, in there.

40:43.484 --> 40:45.965
That's-that's where he died.

41:03.199 --> 41:06.420
I knew your daddy mostly
through the penal system.

41:06.551 --> 41:09.423
George, he wasn't a--
wasn't a bad man.

41:09.554 --> 41:10.859
Sense he felt
he was misrepresented

41:10.990 --> 41:13.688
by-by his own actions.

41:22.871 --> 41:25.700
That is a mighty fine watch.

41:25.831 --> 41:27.180
Your daddy
carried that proudly.

41:29.269 --> 41:32.359
I got the--I got the same one.

41:34.317 --> 41:37.103
Dunlaps' bargain bin.

41:37.233 --> 41:39.627
You believe that? Years back.

41:41.890 --> 41:42.935
Damn thing's
still ticking, though.

41:44.893 --> 41:46.199
Keeps on ticking.

41:50.333 --> 41:52.640
I'm afraid you're mistaken.

41:52.771 --> 41:54.729
You never knew my father.

41:54.860 --> 41:56.383
You knew some other man.

42:01.127 --> 42:02.302
Mom.

42:04.130 --> 42:05.348
It's me.

42:16.708 --> 42:18.274
It's all right.

42:18.405 --> 42:20.102
Dad's here.

42:20.233 --> 42:21.626
He-he came back to get us.

42:47.173 --> 42:48.566
Hello, bubby.

42:58.663 --> 43:00.142
Room for two out here?

43:08.977 --> 43:11.197
I want you to know
that I fired those bastards,

43:11.327 --> 43:13.242
both of them,
Peter and what's-his-name.

43:15.680 --> 43:17.769
I told them to look out
for you.

43:18.465 --> 43:20.641
For a few days. That's all.

43:21.773 --> 43:24.602
They had no right roughing
you up the way they did.

43:32.914 --> 43:34.786
If I could go back in time...

43:59.027 --> 44:00.376
Is this the way you want it?

44:16.915 --> 44:18.133
When you get back
to the White House,

44:18.264 --> 44:20.483
give Dick regards for me.

44:20.614 --> 44:22.311
I'm not going back
to the White House.

44:23.312 --> 44:24.879
When I heard what they did
to you out here,

44:24.966 --> 44:26.533
I submitted my resignation.

44:27.882 --> 44:29.231
Should be on the news soon.

44:29.362 --> 44:31.581
I think Dick's processing it.

44:31.669 --> 44:33.888
I know it's hard to believe...

44:35.281 --> 44:37.196
...but I've always tried to be
a good husband to you, Martha.

45:13.841 --> 45:15.887
Yeah, you can
tell your guy to leave.

45:16.017 --> 45:18.324
She's running like a champ.

45:18.454 --> 45:20.718
Just needed a little clean-out
on the intake, that's all.

45:20.848 --> 45:22.241
My guy said
it would take weeks

45:22.371 --> 45:23.677
to fix the transmission.

45:23.808 --> 45:25.331
Ah, not that complicated.

45:26.767 --> 45:28.943
Same Kraut that made this car

45:29.074 --> 45:31.554
did them VWs for Hitler.

45:31.685 --> 45:35.515
Nazis tended to keep things
pretty simple.

45:37.517 --> 45:40.302
The magic
ain't in the car, son.

45:40.433 --> 45:41.521
Mm.

45:41.651 --> 45:43.436
It's in the name.

45:43.523 --> 45:45.699
Porsche.

45:45.830 --> 45:47.745
Right name can move mountains.

45:54.882 --> 45:57.493
-Can I use your phone?
-Well, sure.

46:04.109 --> 46:05.675
God.

46:13.292 --> 46:14.554
Darn it.

46:18.906 --> 46:22.083
Honey, I think there's
someone here to see you.

46:22.214 --> 46:24.259
Yes. I can see that.

46:30.396 --> 46:32.311
Mmm.

46:32.398 --> 46:33.921
Wow.

46:34.008 --> 46:35.270
That is a tasty burger.

46:37.490 --> 46:39.187
Well, thank you for meeting me
at-at such short notice,

46:39.318 --> 46:40.710
uh, Director Gray, sir.

46:40.841 --> 46:42.277
I-I-I know things
have been very busy

46:42.408 --> 46:44.584
over at the, uh,
bureau since you took over.

46:44.714 --> 46:46.064
To tell you the truth,

46:46.151 --> 46:48.414
I normally wouldn't
take this meeting...

46:48.544 --> 46:49.589
but your man said
it had something to do

46:49.719 --> 46:50.982
with the president.

46:53.549 --> 46:54.812
Well, you see, sir, uh...

46:56.465 --> 46:58.859
...this box

46:58.990 --> 47:01.601
contains
highly sensitive material

47:01.731 --> 47:03.603
that could be very damaging
to the president

47:03.733 --> 47:05.083
if it were to get out.

47:07.520 --> 47:09.957
And...

47:10.088 --> 47:12.612
I have been instructed
to get rid of it.

47:18.357 --> 47:19.227
I see.

47:21.316 --> 47:24.450
And, well, to be honest
with you, sir,

47:24.537 --> 47:25.930
I-I just want to do
the right thing here,

47:26.060 --> 47:27.801
and-and, uh,

47:27.932 --> 47:30.238
that is why I-I cannot do

47:30.369 --> 47:33.807
as I have been
instructed to do.

47:35.853 --> 47:36.854
Why is that?

47:38.812 --> 47:39.682
I'm...

47:42.685 --> 47:46.167
...I'm just too close
to the president, you know?

47:46.298 --> 47:48.648
I'm-I'm in the Oval
three times a week.

47:48.778 --> 47:50.041
I know his kids,
for Pete's sake--

47:50.171 --> 47:52.347
Tricia
and-and-and the other one--

47:52.478 --> 47:55.785
and, you know, I-I just can't
run the risk of this

47:55.916 --> 47:57.613
blowing back on Dick, you know.

47:57.744 --> 47:59.485
And that's why when I--when I
raised these very concerns

47:59.615 --> 48:03.141
to him personally yesterday,

48:03.271 --> 48:07.580
he decided that it shouldn't
be me that handles it.

48:12.541 --> 48:13.586
It should be you.

48:19.244 --> 48:21.420
Are you telling me

48:21.507 --> 48:24.684
that the president asked for me
to do this...

48:24.771 --> 48:25.728
personally?

48:27.643 --> 48:30.124
Dick and I feel
that this way, uh,

48:30.255 --> 48:31.473
if there's ever a question,
you know,

48:31.604 --> 48:33.388
the administration
can honestly say

48:33.519 --> 48:36.696
that we handed the information
over to the FBI

48:36.826 --> 48:39.917
to be handled... by you.

48:46.836 --> 48:49.361
Is the president...

48:49.491 --> 48:51.102
mad at me?

48:51.232 --> 48:53.278
Did I cross him in some way?

48:53.408 --> 48:56.542
Oh, no. No, no, no, no.
Gosh, no, no, no. No.

48:56.672 --> 48:57.717
You're looking at this
all wrong, Pat.

48:57.847 --> 48:59.023
Uh, may I call you Pat? No?

49:01.242 --> 49:03.897
Don't think of this as a--
as a punishment.

49:04.028 --> 49:06.378
Think of this as...
an opportunity.

49:10.686 --> 49:12.688
Dick'll owe you one for this.

49:12.819 --> 49:13.733
So will I.

49:17.911 --> 49:19.217
So like a real meeting?

49:19.347 --> 49:20.870
Not just a handshake
and a hand job?

49:20.958 --> 49:24.091
No, Rose Mary specifically
said, "Clear the whole hour."

49:24.222 --> 49:25.788
President really wants
to get to know me.

49:25.919 --> 49:27.573
-Look out, Strom Thurmond.

49:27.703 --> 49:29.357
There's a new
swinging dick in town.

49:29.488 --> 49:33.013
-You hear that?

49:33.144 --> 49:35.059
-Oh, Jesus Christ.
-Is that--

49:35.189 --> 49:35.929
What the fuck's he doing here?

49:36.060 --> 49:36.886
I don't know.

49:38.584 --> 49:39.977
All right.
Let me deal with this.

49:49.203 --> 49:51.118
What the hell are you doing?

49:51.249 --> 49:53.555
Do you know what could happen
if we're seen together?

49:53.642 --> 49:54.774
I came in
through the service entrance.

49:54.904 --> 49:56.732
Took evasive measures.

49:56.863 --> 49:58.865
I had a newspaper which I used
to partially cover my face.

50:01.172 --> 50:03.304
So, how have you been?

50:03.391 --> 50:05.002
-How have I been?
-Yeah.

50:05.132 --> 50:06.133
I've been trying to clear up
your fucking mess.

50:06.264 --> 50:07.613
That's how I've been.

50:07.743 --> 50:09.615
No, I mean how have you been
personally?

50:09.745 --> 50:11.530
I, uh, heard you
and that platinum blonde number

50:11.660 --> 50:14.141
-are on the rocks.
-What?

50:14.228 --> 50:15.621
How do you know about that?

50:15.751 --> 50:17.536
These things travel.
I'm so sorry.

50:17.666 --> 50:20.060
She seemed like a profoundly
decent young woman.

50:20.191 --> 50:22.236
Ingeniously healthy bust,
as well.

50:22.367 --> 50:24.934
Gordon, I do not want to talk
about this with you, okay?

50:32.725 --> 50:34.683
-Hello.
-Hi.

50:34.814 --> 50:37.164
-Lo siento.I-I'll leave.
-No, no, no. Está bien.

50:37.295 --> 50:39.906
-Está bien.
-Gracias.

50:40.037 --> 50:41.212
Oh, for Christ's sake.

50:45.303 --> 50:46.043
All right,
will you please just tell me

50:46.130 --> 50:48.088
why the fuck you're here?

50:48.219 --> 50:50.525
First, I need to know
that I'm correct in assuming

50:50.656 --> 50:51.918
that you're
the damage control officer

50:52.005 --> 50:52.919
of this Watergate problem.

50:53.746 --> 50:55.182
Excuse me?

50:55.313 --> 50:56.618
I need to know how much
you need to know.

50:56.749 --> 50:58.142
And if you're
the damage control officer,

50:58.272 --> 50:59.578
then you need to know it all.
Do you follow?

50:59.708 --> 51:01.623
Yes. Fine. What's wrong?

51:06.367 --> 51:09.153
A couple of FBI agents
paid me a visit the other day.

51:09.283 --> 51:10.980
I managed to stave them off,
but it's only a matter of time

51:11.111 --> 51:13.026
before they bring me in,
Hunt too.

51:13.592 --> 51:15.159
The bureau's handled.

51:15.289 --> 51:16.638
Handled?

51:16.769 --> 51:18.075
Pat Gray.

51:20.381 --> 51:21.730
Pat Gray is feeding me
their reports, okay?

51:21.817 --> 51:23.080
You satisfied?

51:23.210 --> 51:24.733
Oh, director of the FBI.
Very impressive.

51:24.864 --> 51:25.865
How did you manage that?

51:25.995 --> 51:27.606
I managed.

51:27.693 --> 51:29.260
Seems I underestimated you,
Dean.

51:33.873 --> 51:35.657
Con permiso.

51:35.788 --> 51:36.832
Sí, sí. Naturalmente.

51:38.791 --> 51:40.662
As for my men
who've already been arrested,

51:40.793 --> 51:43.317
they're soldiers;
they won't talk.

51:43.448 --> 51:45.885
But it's imperative
that we post bail and soon.

51:46.015 --> 51:47.626
-Of course. Of course.
-There's just one more thing.

51:49.976 --> 51:51.020
La luz.

51:56.548 --> 51:59.116
I need you to know
that I meant what I said

51:59.246 --> 52:00.595
about taking
full responsibility

52:00.726 --> 52:01.640
for what's transpired.

52:03.424 --> 52:04.686
I am prepared to suffer

52:04.773 --> 52:07.472
the necessary consequences
of my actions.

52:08.037 --> 52:09.604
Right, sure. I appreciate that.

52:09.735 --> 52:11.737
For instance,

52:11.867 --> 52:14.087
if I were to go out
for a jog one morning,

52:14.218 --> 52:16.698
much like this one,

52:16.829 --> 52:20.006
and if, on that jog, I were
to be shot through the forehead

52:20.093 --> 52:23.575
with a high-caliber bullet
from a sniper's rifle,

52:23.705 --> 52:25.359
I would happily accept
that outcome.

52:26.534 --> 52:30.147
Uh, uh, well, that's, um...

52:30.277 --> 52:32.105
that's certainly
very thoughtful of you, Gordon.

52:32.236 --> 52:34.977
Uh, I-I-I don't think
we're quite there yet.

52:35.064 --> 52:36.544
I know, but if it were
to come to that--

52:36.675 --> 52:39.156
-Well, I don't think it will.
-But if it were...

52:39.286 --> 52:42.333
if it were,

52:42.463 --> 52:44.813
you should know that I'm ready

52:44.944 --> 52:47.294
to make an offering

52:47.425 --> 52:48.904
of myself...

52:51.951 --> 52:54.040
...for the kingdom.

53:06.400 --> 53:08.315
-You all right?
-Mm-hmm.

53:09.925 --> 53:14.321
It's just some...
chemical vapors.

53:17.019 --> 53:18.673
These are dark days, compadre,

53:18.804 --> 53:20.240
but we'll get through them
one way or another.

53:24.418 --> 53:27.900
I'm proud to take my orders
from you from now on.

53:29.031 --> 53:31.033
-Wh-what did you say?
-You hadn't heard?

53:31.120 --> 53:33.166
Nixon fired Mitchell.

53:33.297 --> 53:35.081
That loudmouth bitch wife
of his

53:35.168 --> 53:36.648
was becoming too much
of a liability.

53:38.650 --> 53:40.217
You're at the center
of this now.

54:24.043 --> 54:26.741
-Hey, pal.
-Daddy, you're home.

54:26.828 --> 54:28.526
All right, don't get up.

54:28.656 --> 54:29.962
I'm just coming in
to say good night.

54:33.705 --> 54:36.490
-Put your hands up!

54:36.621 --> 54:38.840
What happened to your finger?

54:38.971 --> 54:40.189
Oh, Daddy had
a little accident.

54:42.061 --> 54:43.280
You know what?

54:43.845 --> 54:47.545
I brought you... a present.

54:49.677 --> 54:51.636
Whoa.

54:51.766 --> 54:54.029
See this watch?

54:54.160 --> 54:55.814
Do you know
who it once belonged to?

55:11.656 --> 55:13.179
We could get
a place in the country.

55:15.268 --> 55:16.574
Maybe even in Pine Bluff.

55:20.534 --> 55:22.493
Your daddy always wanted
a ranch, isn't that right?

55:26.758 --> 55:27.846
Said he was a king.

55:29.238 --> 55:29.978
What's that, honey?

55:31.632 --> 55:32.894
Nothin'.
