00:12.095 --> 00:14.056
<i>I hated being Fatty Patty.</i>

00:14.223 --> 00:16.725
<i>But it was a cakewalk compared to this.</i>

00:17.184 --> 00:19.937
Murderer!

00:24.566 --> 00:27.319
<i>Dixie was dead, and I was responsible.</i>

00:28.111 --> 00:29.821
You didn't kill Dixie.

00:30.531 --> 00:31.532
We did.

00:32.406 --> 00:36.078
I'm deep inside you.

00:41.416 --> 00:44.086
<i>I hadn't heard anything
about what happened to Dixie.</i>

00:44.169 --> 00:46.672
<i>But if she was dead and I was responsible,</i>

00:46.922 --> 00:48.924
<i>it was my worse nightmare come true.</i>

00:49.091 --> 00:52.386
<i>Maybe I wasn't lucky that my pregnancy
scare turned out to be a teratoma.</i>

00:53.178 --> 00:55.347
<i>Maybe there was evil deep inside of me.</i>

00:56.390 --> 00:58.392
You okay? I heard you screaming.

00:58.642 --> 00:59.560
Yeah.

01:00.143 --> 01:01.895
Yeah, I had a nightmare

01:01.979 --> 01:04.105
about Dixie being dead...

01:04.897 --> 01:07.526
and my teratoma being alive.

01:07.609 --> 01:08.569
Oh, honey.

01:09.152 --> 01:10.946
Of course you're having nightmares, okay?

01:11.029 --> 01:12.322
You've been traumatized.

01:12.864 --> 01:13.782
Come on.

01:13.907 --> 01:16.910
You saw Dixie get taken away
in an ambulance,

01:17.035 --> 01:18.370
you got questioned by the cops.

01:18.453 --> 01:21.248
But they all agreed it was an accident.
Everything's gonna be fine.

01:21.331 --> 01:22.499
Not if Dixie dies.

01:22.874 --> 01:24.084
Oh, she won't, baby.

01:24.251 --> 01:25.836
The bad ones live forever.

01:28.630 --> 01:29.464
Did you know?

01:30.215 --> 01:32.384
That I could have been a twin?

01:34.553 --> 01:35.470
Not exactly.

01:37.014 --> 01:37.931
When I was pregnant,

01:38.015 --> 01:41.435
I had a very vivid dream
that you were a twin,

01:41.935 --> 01:44.938
but I forgot all about it until yesterday.

01:45.230 --> 01:46.231
That's crazy.

01:46.356 --> 01:47.941
Not as crazy as you eating your sister.

01:50.110 --> 01:51.445
Too soon.

01:56.450 --> 01:57.284
Pastor Mike.

01:58.118 --> 02:00.454
If he's calling this early,
it can't be good.

02:12.174 --> 02:13.884
Bob, what are you...?

02:13.967 --> 02:16.637
Shh. Just go with it.

02:19.931 --> 02:21.183
Now that I have you,

02:21.808 --> 02:23.268
I'll never let you go.

02:23.977 --> 02:25.896
I'm deep inside of you.

02:31.693 --> 02:34.696
<i>I did not want Bob Barnard
deep inside me.</i>

02:35.155 --> 02:36.323
<i>I wanted him out.</i>

02:37.032 --> 02:38.867
<i>I felt guilty about our kiss,</i>

02:39.284 --> 02:41.578
<i>like I had to confess.</i>

02:46.333 --> 02:47.459
Is everything okay?

02:48.377 --> 02:49.503
<i>Not exactly.</i>

02:57.177 --> 02:59.429
You think Patty has a demon inside of her?

02:59.513 --> 03:02.849
My guess is it's the soul
of the twin she consumed.

03:02.933 --> 03:05.268
Most likely,
it's furious it never got born.

03:05.686 --> 03:07.854
You need to take this seriously, Bob.

03:07.938 --> 03:11.733
Patty's teratoma made her throw
Dixie Sinclair off the Ween-Mobile.

03:12.609 --> 03:15.445
You just said teratoma and Ween-Mobile
in the same sentence,

03:15.529 --> 03:17.864
so it's hard to take you seriously.

03:17.948 --> 03:20.534
Besides, Dixie made Patty push her.

03:20.617 --> 03:21.618
Look at her neck.

03:22.160 --> 03:26.164
Oh, and also, demons do not exist.

03:26.248 --> 03:27.416
They certainly do.

03:28.041 --> 03:31.795
And if Patty doesn't get hers removed,
I'm gonna have to strip her of her crown.

03:32.546 --> 03:33.463
Removed?

03:33.672 --> 03:35.006
Like, you mean, surgically?

03:35.090 --> 03:36.591
Absolutely not.

03:36.883 --> 03:38.385
She would miss regionals.

03:39.010 --> 03:40.262
There's another solution.

03:40.345 --> 03:41.471
One that's non-surgical

03:42.139 --> 03:44.808
and significantly more unorthodox.

03:45.225 --> 03:46.309
I'm listening.

03:49.813 --> 03:50.897
An exorcism.

03:52.149 --> 03:53.734
What, you mean like the movie?

03:53.817 --> 03:55.527
I know an expert in Atlanta who does them.

03:57.404 --> 03:58.238
Father Schwartz.

03:58.905 --> 04:01.658
- Schwartz?
- He converted. He's a Jew for Jesus.

04:01.742 --> 04:03.618
Of course he is.

04:03.702 --> 04:04.703
This is insane!

04:05.662 --> 04:07.122
Patty is not possessed.

04:07.247 --> 04:12.085
And if you try and take away her crown
because she didn't have an exorcism,

04:12.961 --> 04:14.045
I will go to the press,

04:14.421 --> 04:16.714
and you will look like
a religious nut case.

04:17.007 --> 04:17.966
Bye-bye, pageant.

04:18.507 --> 04:19.634
Bye-bye, job.

04:23.096 --> 04:26.099
See? Crisis averted.
You get to keep your crown.

04:26.183 --> 04:28.351
But what about my immortal soul?

04:29.019 --> 04:32.522
You're not actually buying into all that
demon nonsense, are you?

04:32.689 --> 04:33.565
Think about it.

04:33.648 --> 04:35.609
It would explain a lot of my behavior.

04:35.692 --> 04:37.986
So would borderline personality disorder.

04:38.820 --> 04:39.780
I'm just saying.

04:40.781 --> 04:43.450
I've always felt this darkness
inside of me.

04:43.533 --> 04:45.911
That doesn't mean you have a demon.

04:45.994 --> 04:47.496
It'd be a relief if I did.

04:47.871 --> 04:51.291
Then it would mean it's not my fault
for being the way that I am.

04:52.000 --> 04:55.378
Then maybe if I got rid of it,
I could be, like, a normal teenager.

04:55.462 --> 04:59.299
Enough. We have real problems.
Like your image.

04:59.382 --> 05:01.218
You threw Dixie off a food truck.

05:01.301 --> 05:02.969
No brawler's ever gonna win regionals.

05:03.386 --> 05:05.096
I hadn't even thought about that.

05:05.180 --> 05:07.098
- I was more worried that I killed her.
- See?

05:07.182 --> 05:08.558
You don't have a demon.

05:08.642 --> 05:10.685
Otherwise you wouldn't be worried
about Dixie.

05:10.894 --> 05:13.188
Listen. Go to school,

05:13.271 --> 05:15.857
see what you can find out
about Dixie's condition.

05:15.941 --> 05:18.985
In the meantime, I'll create a narrative
about your little...

05:19.569 --> 05:20.695
punch 'n munch.

05:29.538 --> 05:30.705
<i>The good news was,</i>

05:31.122 --> 05:33.250
<i>there was no shrine
in front of Dixie's locker.</i>

05:33.959 --> 05:36.378
<i>Bad news was,
everyone was staring at me.</i>

05:36.461 --> 05:38.171
<i>Maybe I did have an image problem.</i>

05:38.255 --> 05:39.714
What is everybody looking at?

05:40.549 --> 05:41.466
You've gone viral.

05:46.429 --> 05:47.514
Oh, my God.

05:48.014 --> 05:50.183
Do you think
the regionals judges have seen this?

05:50.267 --> 05:51.309
Everyone's seen it.

05:56.648 --> 05:57.524
Look at me.

05:58.191 --> 05:59.526
I'm pure evil.

06:00.443 --> 06:02.028
You're just defending yourself.

06:02.112 --> 06:03.321
I mean, look at her.

06:03.530 --> 06:04.948
She's banana-pants.

06:05.115 --> 06:07.450
Choi told me she has all sorts
of mental disorders.

06:07.534 --> 06:09.661
She told him all about them
when they were banging.

06:09.828 --> 06:11.788
Well, none of that matters if she dies.

06:12.122 --> 06:14.207
I heard she's alive, but on life support.

06:14.374 --> 06:16.668
But Choi heard that
she flew down to Mexico

06:16.751 --> 06:18.461
for some state-of-the-art surgery.

06:19.421 --> 06:22.007
- Do my eyes look red to you?
- That's the lighting.

06:22.090 --> 06:23.049
Or the demon.

06:23.466 --> 06:24.301
Excuse me.

06:25.093 --> 06:26.803
Didn't your dad tell you
to stay away from me?

06:26.887 --> 06:28.805
He told me all about you being possessed.

06:29.014 --> 06:30.390
I'm glad you're not getting the exorcism.

06:31.182 --> 06:32.267
Did he say "exorcism"?

06:34.603 --> 06:36.187
Okay, listen.

06:36.271 --> 06:38.899
This is gonna sound completely batshit,

06:38.982 --> 06:42.402
but Pastor Mike thinks that my teratoma
might be an evil presence.

06:42.694 --> 06:43.570
Like a demon.

06:45.614 --> 06:47.741
Nonnie, you've known me my whole life.

06:48.241 --> 06:50.702
You think it's possible
I could have a demon inside me?

06:51.786 --> 06:55.123
Hmm. Hmm.

06:56.499 --> 06:57.584
Hmm.

06:58.001 --> 07:00.879
- Wow, you think I'm on team Satan.
- No.

07:01.713 --> 07:03.840
- Actual demons aren't real, so...
- They are.

07:04.382 --> 07:07.260
I've lived all over the world.
I've seen some things.

07:08.595 --> 07:09.846
I gotta get to class.

07:12.265 --> 07:14.184
- What do you mean?
- When I lived in Brazil,

07:14.351 --> 07:16.061
I spent some time with a <i> pajé </i> there.

07:16.144 --> 07:17.187
A shaman.

07:17.771 --> 07:20.899
He believed in all this stuff.
Demons, evil spirits...

07:21.441 --> 07:23.944
- Bullshit.
- Said there was power in the dark.

07:24.653 --> 07:25.528
What do you mean?

07:25.946 --> 07:26.863
Let's find out.

07:27.739 --> 07:28.907
We should summon your demon.

07:28.990 --> 07:31.743
- Summon my demon? Right.
- Seriously.

07:32.077 --> 07:33.411
We should have a séance tonight.

07:34.537 --> 07:36.539
What makes you think I want
to do anything with you?

07:36.831 --> 07:38.917
After you tried to manipulate me

07:39.000 --> 07:42.963
into almost marrying you and having a baby
just to avoid going to military school?

07:43.046 --> 07:45.382
You really think
I'd commit to raising a child

07:45.507 --> 07:47.008
just to avoid military school?

07:47.092 --> 07:50.261
I've no idea what you would do.
You are full of surprises.

07:50.345 --> 07:51.471
I'm trying to help you.

07:51.554 --> 07:53.431
Yeah? Why?

07:55.266 --> 07:56.309
Because I love you.

07:58.812 --> 08:00.397
I'm sorry I didn't say it back.

08:00.814 --> 08:03.191
Please, give me another chance.

08:03.566 --> 08:06.027
<i>I wasn't desperate enough
to believe that he loved me.</i>

08:06.111 --> 08:08.405
<i>But I was desperate enough
to let him help me.</i>

08:15.078 --> 08:17.205
<i>I already had enough problems.</i>

08:17.664 --> 08:20.875
<i>Now I had to deal with a viral
vampire bitch fight?</i>

08:29.384 --> 08:32.345
<i>I could e-mail my friends
at the </i> Masonville Gazette.

08:32.429 --> 08:34.054
<i>Help to spin Patty's narrative.</i>

08:34.264 --> 08:37.433
<i>It was a hell of a lot easier
than dealing with my own story.</i>

08:55.285 --> 08:56.369
Hey, Bob.

08:56.661 --> 08:57.954
How's Dixie?

08:58.538 --> 08:59.414
With Regina.

08:59.914 --> 09:02.500
She got out of jail
on compassionate release.

09:03.585 --> 09:05.378
We need to talk about our kiss.

09:06.046 --> 09:08.423
Never happened.
My word against yours.

09:08.506 --> 09:10.175
I meant what I said, Bob.

09:11.301 --> 09:12.635
I'm in love with you.

09:12.719 --> 09:13.845
Stop saying that!

09:13.928 --> 09:15.013
I can't stop.

09:15.096 --> 09:16.765
It's been bottled up for so long,

09:16.848 --> 09:18.725
now that I said it out loud,
I can't stop.

09:18.808 --> 09:20.643
I love you.
I love you, I love you, I love you.

09:20.852 --> 09:22.896
Why do you keep stabbing me in the back?

09:23.104 --> 09:25.023
I'm just pulling on your pigtails

09:25.106 --> 09:26.858
'cause I couldn't tell you how I feel.

09:26.941 --> 09:30.153
Sleeping with Stella Rose was just pulling
at my pigtails?

09:30.236 --> 09:32.572
Now that I did
to try and feel closer to you.

09:33.948 --> 09:36.993
Hey, years of pining away
makes you do some crazy things.

09:37.494 --> 09:38.870
What about Etta Mae?

09:41.039 --> 09:42.874
I needed things to look a certain way,

09:43.291 --> 09:45.293
so I got married to a doctor.

09:45.877 --> 09:50.298
A beautiful, strong, sexy,
successful woman who's never around.

09:50.381 --> 09:52.342
- Does she know? About your...?
- No.

09:52.425 --> 09:55.220
But her schedule gives me freedom
to do what I need to do.

09:55.303 --> 09:56.846
You mean, sleep with other men!

09:56.930 --> 10:00.058
Bob, in my heart,
I always wanted to be with you.

10:00.517 --> 10:02.852
But I never thought it could be mutual.

10:04.145 --> 10:05.438
Until you kissed me back.

10:05.897 --> 10:08.274
I did not kiss you back.

10:08.358 --> 10:10.235
I was pushing you away with my lips.

10:10.318 --> 10:13.363
You didn't feel like a man
who didn't wanna be kissed.

10:13.446 --> 10:17.867
Maybe that's the reason why you've been
so passionately hateful towards me.

10:17.951 --> 10:20.995
You've been covering up
that you're madly in love with me.

10:22.622 --> 10:23.915
That's not true!

10:24.207 --> 10:26.459
- Passion's passion, Bob.
- I'm not gay!

10:26.543 --> 10:28.336
Just stay open, Bob.

10:28.419 --> 10:29.754
I love women!

10:29.838 --> 10:32.549
Tell yourself you're bisexual.
We all go through that phase.

10:32.632 --> 10:36.219
Bisexuals are like demons or aliens.
They don't exist.

10:36.302 --> 10:39.639
Totally agree. Bi is just a stop
on the train to Gayville.

10:39.722 --> 10:41.099
Chug-a-chug-a-choo-choo!

10:41.182 --> 10:42.142
Back off!

10:43.768 --> 10:45.812
This is harassment.
You are my boss.

10:46.146 --> 10:47.355
Just think of us as partners.

10:47.647 --> 10:50.400
Stop making it sound so gay!

10:50.900 --> 10:53.862
You know what they say about people
who are homophobic, Bob?

10:54.320 --> 10:55.738
They say they're in denial.

10:58.366 --> 10:59.284
Get out!

11:00.910 --> 11:01.995
I have work to do.

11:12.172 --> 11:14.174
You're right. We both cheated.

11:14.299 --> 11:15.341
We're even.

11:15.425 --> 11:16.759
Let's have make-up sex.

11:16.843 --> 11:20.763
Because I am a heterosexual man
with heterosexual man needs.

11:20.847 --> 11:25.268
Bob, I love that you wanna work it out,
but sex is not gonna solve our issues.

11:25.351 --> 11:27.187
I am pretty sure
it is going to solve my issue.

11:27.270 --> 11:30.231
Bob, we need counseling.

11:30.773 --> 11:34.319
My friend Gayle from WMBS
is a licensed family therapist,

11:34.402 --> 11:36.154
and her husband Mike is a pastor.

11:36.237 --> 11:40.283
- Together, they do spiritual couples...
- I know Pastor Mike.

11:40.658 --> 11:41.868
He is a lunatic.

11:42.285 --> 11:45.246
I don't wanna talk to him
about our personal problems.

11:45.371 --> 11:47.540
Bob, just stay open.

11:47.832 --> 11:49.834
<i>Why did everyone keep saying that?</i>

11:49.918 --> 11:50.752
But...

11:51.294 --> 11:54.422
make-up sex is so much... cheaper.

11:55.006 --> 11:56.549
Okay. Okay, you know what?

11:56.633 --> 11:58.635
Therapy first, sex later.

11:58.718 --> 12:00.386
I'm gonna call her right now

12:00.470 --> 12:03.348
and see if they are available
to squeeze us in tonight.

12:17.028 --> 12:19.155
The spirit board is a gateway

12:19.614 --> 12:21.824
to contact beings on the other side.

12:24.160 --> 12:26.162
Sorry I'm late.
We were having a discussion.

12:26.829 --> 12:28.957
About one of us trying
to blow off our date tonight.

12:29.040 --> 12:30.708
A séance can be a date.

12:31.167 --> 12:32.627
Nonnie, could I talk to you?

12:35.880 --> 12:37.298
Did you have to bring Dee?

12:37.799 --> 12:40.426
Having a demon is kind of private.

12:40.510 --> 12:42.095
Maybe you should just be grateful

12:42.178 --> 12:43.930
you have a bestie
that always shows up for you,

12:44.180 --> 12:46.474
and that her girlfriend is willing
to give up her alone time

12:46.557 --> 12:47.934
to co-sign that bullshit.

12:48.017 --> 12:49.727
Maybe you should
just mind your own business.

12:49.811 --> 12:51.980
Maybe we should start the séance?

12:59.404 --> 13:02.699
We've gathered tonight
to find out if Patty Bladell

13:02.949 --> 13:04.409
is inhabited by a demon.

13:06.995 --> 13:07.870
Is she?

13:08.496 --> 13:12.417
<i>I didn't know who he was talking
to or how they would even talk back.</i>

13:16.462 --> 13:17.297
Yes?

13:20.300 --> 13:21.134
Dee pushed it.

13:22.260 --> 13:24.887
That's the spirits giving you
their answer, demon girl.

13:25.138 --> 13:26.014
Mystery solved.

13:26.806 --> 13:29.225
You ready to go?
We can still make bingo at Purr Party.

13:29.309 --> 13:30.310
Cut the shit.

13:31.436 --> 13:32.478
This is serious.

13:39.902 --> 13:41.404
Are there any spirits present?

13:41.487 --> 13:42.905
<i>It couldn't happen again.</i>

13:48.745 --> 13:49.579
Yes.

13:53.583 --> 13:56.294
Is this my unborn sister?

13:59.005 --> 14:00.006
No.

14:01.341 --> 14:03.009
Then who is it?

14:06.346 --> 14:07.221
H...

14:08.765 --> 14:09.640
I...

14:10.308 --> 14:11.142
F...

14:13.227 --> 14:14.062
A...

14:14.979 --> 14:16.022
T...

14:16.564 --> 14:17.398
T...

14:18.191 --> 14:19.025
Y.

14:19.525 --> 14:20.985
"Hi, Fatty"?

14:22.403 --> 14:23.363
Who is this?

14:26.074 --> 14:26.949
J?

14:29.619 --> 14:30.495
John?

14:32.872 --> 14:33.790
Homeless guy.

14:34.916 --> 14:36.000
Who's John the homeless guy?

14:37.335 --> 14:39.879
It's the guy who broke my jaw.
He's the reason I got skinny.

14:43.049 --> 14:44.300
K...

14:45.093 --> 14:46.010
I...

14:47.678 --> 14:48.513
L...

14:49.806 --> 14:50.640
L...

14:52.809 --> 14:53.810
E...

14:54.769 --> 14:55.603
R?

14:55.686 --> 14:58.189
Then why is he calling you a killer?

15:01.442 --> 15:02.443
Because...

15:03.277 --> 15:04.112
I...

15:04.862 --> 15:05.696
Killed him?

15:06.322 --> 15:09.951
I didn't. I just wished he was dead.

15:10.159 --> 15:12.161
And then he had a heart attack and died.

15:12.829 --> 15:14.038
Oh, you definitely have a demon.

15:15.832 --> 15:16.666
Yes?

15:18.292 --> 15:19.252
Okay, séance over.

15:21.254 --> 15:22.171
Yes!

15:26.384 --> 15:27.385
Don't freak out.

15:27.802 --> 15:30.012
Easy for you to say.
You don't have a demon.

15:30.346 --> 15:32.098
There's something seriously wrong with me.

15:32.265 --> 15:34.559
What if everything
you think is wrong with you

15:34.725 --> 15:36.018
is actually right?

15:37.812 --> 15:38.855
Look, I love you.

15:39.647 --> 15:40.523
I do.

15:40.731 --> 15:43.985
All that rage and power and fire.

15:44.694 --> 15:45.736
It's amazing.

15:46.404 --> 15:48.781
And what if this thing inside you
is the source of all of that?

15:48.865 --> 15:50.992
What if it makes you who you are?

15:51.951 --> 15:52.994
Don't get rid of it.

15:53.494 --> 15:54.495
Embrace it.

15:54.912 --> 15:56.873
But it makes me do terrible things,

15:56.956 --> 15:58.958
like rage-kill a homeless guy,

15:59.041 --> 16:01.002
- or throw Dixie off the Ween-Mobile.
- That's because

16:01.085 --> 16:02.920
you haven't learned to control it.

16:03.588 --> 16:04.839
I bet if you did,

16:05.047 --> 16:06.632
you could make it work for you.

16:07.091 --> 16:09.010
For me? How?

16:09.343 --> 16:11.012
You want revenge on your bullies?

16:11.637 --> 16:12.930
You wanna win regionals?

16:13.473 --> 16:14.599
Miss American Lady?

16:15.057 --> 16:18.519
Who better to help you than
a pissed off spirit from beyond the grave?

16:22.440 --> 16:24.400
Okay, if there is...

16:25.234 --> 16:28.196
...even a .01% chance

16:28.279 --> 16:30.740
that this could work,

16:33.159 --> 16:34.660
I'd be a moron not to at least try.

16:35.119 --> 16:36.287
This is what I'm saying.

16:36.496 --> 16:37.914
I wouldn't even know where to begin.

16:38.498 --> 16:41.667
What? Do you just Google,
"How do you control a demon?"

16:44.086 --> 16:45.796
Shut up! This is a thing?

16:46.130 --> 16:47.882
It says we need to find out its name.

16:49.133 --> 16:50.551
We could ask the spirit board.

16:51.344 --> 16:52.178
No way.

16:52.678 --> 16:55.056
No demon worth their horns
is gonna give up their name

16:55.139 --> 16:56.891
if they know it will give me
control over them.

17:00.144 --> 17:02.021
If the demon really is my twin sister,

17:02.688 --> 17:03.814
maybe my mom can help.

17:04.482 --> 17:07.401
She had a dream about twins.
Maybe it had a name...

17:11.071 --> 17:14.742
<i>Bob Barnard was wrong.
I didn't have a gay bone in my body.</i>

17:14.867 --> 17:17.036
Lemon zest tea, anyone?

17:17.537 --> 17:18.913
No, we're fine, thank you.

17:18.996 --> 17:21.915
<i>I was willing to do whatever it took
to make my marriage work,</i>

17:21.999 --> 17:24.460
<i>including facing this awkward situation.</i>

17:24.919 --> 17:28.005
Pastor Mike, I do hope
that there are no hard feelings

17:28.381 --> 17:30.216
about our meeting this morning with Patty.

17:30.508 --> 17:32.468
Well, I wish the outcome
had been different,

17:32.552 --> 17:36.764
but I respect that you are here trying
to exorcise your own demons.

17:37.890 --> 17:40.309
We thought we'd do a role-playing exercise

17:40.518 --> 17:43.187
to help you understand
each other's point of view.

17:43.437 --> 17:46.399
- Coralee, you play Bob, okay?
- Oh.

17:46.482 --> 17:48.442
And really get inside his head, okay?

17:48.526 --> 17:50.987
And try to express his reasons

17:51.070 --> 17:52.863
for going outside your marriage.

17:52.989 --> 17:54.282
Okay, okay.

17:58.119 --> 18:01.080
Coralee, everything that you found

18:01.163 --> 18:03.291
annoying about me, she supported.

18:03.374 --> 18:05.876
Like pageants and hair and makeup,

18:05.960 --> 18:08.421
- and my caboodle.
- I don't walk like that.

18:09.422 --> 18:11.465
And I don't do that fruity thing
with my hand.

18:11.549 --> 18:14.927
Bob, this is about listening
to what she is saying.

18:15.011 --> 18:18.764
You two need to listen
and express how you feel.

18:18.848 --> 18:21.183
You say X, it makes me feel Y.

18:23.728 --> 18:25.062
When you say I'm gay,

18:25.229 --> 18:27.440
I feel like you don't see I'm not gay.

18:37.033 --> 18:38.242
What are you doing?

18:40.077 --> 18:41.203
Counting my savings.

18:41.746 --> 18:44.957
Your 18th birthday is coming up,
and I wanna plan something special.

18:47.084 --> 18:49.337
Super weird that
I almost shared a birthday.

18:50.963 --> 18:51.797
Yeah.

18:55.051 --> 18:58.512
You know that dream you had,
that you were pregnant with twins?

18:59.472 --> 19:01.140
Do you remember if you picked out names?

19:01.974 --> 19:02.975
I don't remember. Why?

19:05.478 --> 19:06.312
I don't know.

19:06.812 --> 19:10.608
I was thinking we could write her name
on my birthday cake. Like a memorial.

19:11.901 --> 19:13.361
That's sweet.

19:13.653 --> 19:14.862
And a little creepy.

19:16.197 --> 19:18.574
You know I used to write down
my dreams in my old journal,

19:18.658 --> 19:20.785
and I found it right before your baptism.

19:21.077 --> 19:22.036
Let's take a look.

19:25.164 --> 19:26.040
All right.

19:27.249 --> 19:29.335
I bet we can find something in here.

19:31.128 --> 19:31.962
Who's the hottie?

19:35.591 --> 19:36.425
Gordy.

19:36.926 --> 19:38.761
It's my mom's old boyfriend.

19:39.470 --> 19:40.471
All right.

19:40.721 --> 19:43.724
Sex dream, sex dream, sex dream.

19:44.225 --> 19:46.060
Dream I went to school and almost had sex.

19:46.435 --> 19:47.353
Sex dream.

19:48.312 --> 19:50.731
Oh... lookee there.

19:51.273 --> 19:52.775
One of them was named Patty.

19:54.151 --> 19:55.403
And the other one?

19:57.113 --> 19:57.947
Kitty.

19:58.322 --> 20:00.157
Kitty, great.

20:00.658 --> 20:02.410
Thanks, Mom.

20:11.419 --> 20:12.294
Hmm.

20:18.718 --> 20:21.554
Kitty? That's a weird name for a baby.

20:21.762 --> 20:25.349
Yeah, it's a weird name
for a demon, too, but it's all we got.

20:27.685 --> 20:31.856
So, Google says once you know the name,
you need to integrate the demon,

20:32.106 --> 20:33.399
so you can join forces.

20:34.692 --> 20:37.737
And this doesn't sound crazy to you?
When you say it out loud?

20:38.070 --> 20:40.072
You know that Brazilian shaman
I told you about?

20:40.573 --> 20:42.450
He said he could expel a demon

20:42.533 --> 20:46.078
by writing its name on a piece of paper
and throwing it into a fire.

20:46.871 --> 20:49.415
Okay, so how am I supposed
to integrate a demon?

20:49.498 --> 20:51.208
Write its name on a piece of paper
and eat it?

20:52.710 --> 20:53.753
Makes sense to me.

20:54.879 --> 20:58.382
Okay, I can't believe that writing "Kitty"

20:58.466 --> 21:01.343
on a piece of paper and eating it
can fix me.

21:01.802 --> 21:02.678
It's crazy.

21:03.012 --> 21:06.098
Not any crazier than believing
that pageants can fix you.

21:06.807 --> 21:09.143
At least this isn't something
outside yourself.

21:10.019 --> 21:11.604
What's the worst that can happen?

21:11.979 --> 21:13.189
You eat some paper?

21:14.148 --> 21:15.274
But if it works...

21:16.108 --> 21:18.068
I could have everything I ever wanted.

21:43.928 --> 21:45.679
- Now what?
- We wait.

21:46.764 --> 21:48.766
If magic starts happening, then boom.

21:49.099 --> 21:51.560
Kitty's your bitch.

21:52.978 --> 21:53.854
It's Bob.

21:54.438 --> 21:56.690
"Good news, I fixed your image problem."

21:57.358 --> 21:58.275
There's a link.

21:59.568 --> 22:02.822
"Crazy pageant runner-up
attacks reigning Miss Magic." Jesus.

22:02.905 --> 22:04.281
"Bites her like a vampire."

22:05.366 --> 22:08.494
Oh! Oh, my God!

22:09.078 --> 22:10.246
It worked.

22:11.831 --> 22:13.040
Kitty's my bitch.

22:15.459 --> 22:17.086
Guess Kitty's working for me, too.

22:17.878 --> 22:20.548
So does this mean we're okay?

22:21.841 --> 22:26.428
It means I might possibly consider...

22:27.096 --> 22:29.849
us maybe being okay.

22:32.393 --> 22:34.395
<i>Except my victory was short-lived.</i>

22:34.562 --> 22:37.773
<i>That afternoon, Herman Choi
canceled my sponsorship.</i>

22:38.482 --> 22:40.609
But the fight was Dixie's fault.

22:40.693 --> 22:45.281
- The <i> Masonville Gazette </i> agrees.
- I don't care if Wolf Blitzer agrees.

22:45.364 --> 22:48.284
Our image as a family establishment
has suffered.

22:48.409 --> 22:50.286
Now nobody's eating my wieners.

22:50.953 --> 22:55.207
No wieners, no money.
No money, no sponsorship.

22:59.336 --> 23:01.046
Hey, is this the site
of the Vampire Bitch Fight?

23:01.380 --> 23:02.214
No.

23:04.884 --> 23:06.260
Yes, it is.

23:08.512 --> 23:10.139
- I'm the bitch.
- Whoo!

23:10.222 --> 23:13.726
- What are you doing?
- Drumming up business.

23:14.101 --> 23:16.103
I'm the Wiener Taco spokesperson.

23:16.186 --> 23:18.480
- Would you like a selfie with me?
- Hell yeah!

23:18.772 --> 23:21.150
Your video is the best thing
since "Pen-Pineapple-Apple-Pen."

23:22.234 --> 23:23.277
- Come on.
- Okay.

23:23.944 --> 23:26.280
- Say "Wien-ing."
- Wien-ing!

23:29.450 --> 23:31.619
<i>Maybe Kitty was helping me after all.</i>

23:33.162 --> 23:36.624
<i>Three weeks later,
Wiener Taco was the Masonville hot spot...</i>

23:41.170 --> 23:43.005
<i>I was a true believer...</i>

23:43.589 --> 23:45.758
<i>and I had never felt so empowered.</i>

23:46.759 --> 23:49.470
<i>Herman Choi had doubled down
on my sponsorship.</i>

23:49.553 --> 23:52.640
<i>My mom was making tips hand over fist,</i>

23:52.723 --> 23:54.934
<i>and I had become a local celebrity.</i>

23:55.351 --> 23:57.895
Hey, can you sign our swag?

23:58.228 --> 23:59.855
- Yeah, what do you want?
- One of those.

23:59.939 --> 24:01.315
- Two of those.
- That one.

24:01.649 --> 24:04.026
- Congratulations on viral infamy, Patty.
- Yeah.

24:04.109 --> 24:05.319
And thank you for taking out Dixie.

24:05.402 --> 24:08.614
She was a first-class ass-hat,
and she got what she deserved.

24:10.783 --> 24:12.826
Do you know what she got, exactly?

24:12.910 --> 24:14.161
I still haven't heard.

24:14.244 --> 24:16.288
I heard that she's being trained
to use an exo-suit.

24:16.372 --> 24:18.916
No, no, I heard she's being weaponized
by the military.

24:18.999 --> 24:21.293
- No way.
- Hey, guys, who cares? Okay?

24:21.377 --> 24:23.504
Dixie's gone now, thanks to you.

24:23.587 --> 24:25.547
I can't... I mean, right here, okay?

24:32.680 --> 24:34.390
Okay, thank you.
Thank you so much.

24:34.473 --> 24:35.599
Bye, you guys.

24:37.184 --> 24:40.312
<i>Except Dixie's demise wasn't thanks to me.</i>

24:40.646 --> 24:42.481
<i>It was thanks to Kitty.</i>

24:45.609 --> 24:48.278
<i>So much good had come
from what happened to Dixie,</i>

24:48.362 --> 24:50.406
<i>I didn't really feel bad about it anymore.</i>

24:50.864 --> 24:54.201
- Hi.
<i>- It was almost as if she never existed.</i>

25:04.128 --> 25:07.548
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

25:08.757 --> 25:11.677
Patty, I am so happy to see you.

25:12.219 --> 25:13.137
You are?

25:13.470 --> 25:15.931
I want you to know
there are no hard feelings.

25:16.098 --> 25:19.143
Even though she's paralyzed
from the waist down

25:19.476 --> 25:21.520
and will likely never walk again.

25:22.813 --> 25:26.942
I have no one to blame but myself.
I attacked you.

25:27.651 --> 25:29.153
And I am sorry.

25:29.987 --> 25:32.114
But I'm not sorry it happened.

25:32.990 --> 25:35.993
Because I lost the use of my legs,

25:36.660 --> 25:39.496
I've gained the use of my heart.

25:39.830 --> 25:41.123
<i>And just like that,</i>

25:41.206 --> 25:44.626
<i>Dixie went from being despised
to being loved.</i>

25:44.710 --> 25:46.712
<i>Did that mean people hated me?</i>

25:46.795 --> 25:51.592
Dixie even suggested we have a special
anti-bullying assembly tomorrow.

25:51.675 --> 25:54.470
So you girls can both apologize
to each other

25:54.553 --> 25:56.597
in front of the whole school.

25:57.014 --> 25:59.433
Principal Martin thinks
it's an excellent idea.

26:01.143 --> 26:03.103
Oh, hey, Brick.

26:07.983 --> 26:09.985
Hey. You okay?

26:10.569 --> 26:13.530
No. I have to apologize to Dixie?

26:13.989 --> 26:15.240
Why should I? She attacked me.

26:16.325 --> 26:17.993
Because it's the right thing to do.

26:19.578 --> 26:20.746
Screw what's right.

26:20.829 --> 26:22.206
There's power in what's wrong.

26:22.581 --> 26:23.415
Right, Patty?

26:25.334 --> 26:27.669
- What does that mean?
- Never mind.

26:28.087 --> 26:28.962
You wouldn't understand.

26:29.046 --> 26:30.589
Patty has an evil spirit inside of her,

26:30.672 --> 26:32.716
and we're using it
to manifest whatever we want.

26:34.551 --> 26:36.970
Look, I know it sounds crazy...

26:37.054 --> 26:39.223
He's brainwashing you,
just like he did to Magnolia.

26:39.306 --> 26:40.641
See? Patty's right.

26:41.100 --> 26:42.184
You don't understand.

26:46.313 --> 26:47.147
What?

26:48.023 --> 26:51.068
<i>For the last three weeks,
I had been avoiding Barnard</i>

26:51.151 --> 26:53.153
<i>and keeping my attention on Coralee.</i>

26:53.403 --> 26:57.491
I don't understand how fighting
is gonna lead to intimacy.

26:57.574 --> 26:59.827
Oh, don't worry about it.
Mike and I are gonna show you.

27:00.702 --> 27:02.162
I'll pick a trigger topic.

27:03.622 --> 27:04.456
Our son.

27:05.082 --> 27:05.916
Well...

27:06.750 --> 27:08.544
I'd actually rather not discuss Christian.

27:08.627 --> 27:11.630
When you threaten to send Christian
to military school

27:11.713 --> 27:14.466
and don't follow through,
he knows he can manipulate you.

27:14.550 --> 27:18.929
I hear you, and I feel that
sending Christian away

27:19.012 --> 27:21.723
will only isolate him
and make his problems worse.

27:21.807 --> 27:24.434
Worse? We had to leave Brazil
because of him.

27:24.518 --> 27:26.145
- Wait, why'd you have to leave...?
- You know what's worse?

27:26.228 --> 27:28.105
A mother trying to send her own son
to jail.

27:28.188 --> 27:30.065
It is completely inappropriate.

27:30.149 --> 27:33.277
Oh, that's completely inappropriate?
You know what's inappropriate?

27:33.652 --> 27:34.903
- You're inappropriate.
- You're inappropriate.

27:34.987 --> 27:37.197
No, you know
what I'm talking about when I...

27:38.448 --> 27:39.283
Oh.

27:43.537 --> 27:47.124
Ahem.

27:47.708 --> 27:48.792
Okay.

27:54.173 --> 27:55.424
I'm so thirsty.

27:57.384 --> 27:58.343
Is there...

28:00.345 --> 28:01.180
water?

28:02.389 --> 28:03.640
It's in the kitchen.

28:03.724 --> 28:07.144
Thank you so much. Honey.

28:10.606 --> 28:12.566
See? Make-up sex. It works.

28:12.774 --> 28:14.568
Okay, but I think you have to fight first.

28:15.152 --> 28:16.987
You want to fight? 'Cause we can fight.

28:17.362 --> 28:20.616
Starting with the fact that you slept with
the massage therapist to get back at me.

28:20.866 --> 28:24.119
No. That's not why I did it.
I did it because I wanted to.

28:26.955 --> 28:29.041
Bob, up until recently,

28:29.416 --> 28:33.420
okay, you and I hadn't spent more than
a few days apart for the last 20 years.

28:33.795 --> 28:35.547
Okay? So when I was on my own,

28:36.215 --> 28:41.762
I realized that in all that time,
I never stopped to consider what I wanted.

28:42.930 --> 28:44.181
What do you mean?

28:44.264 --> 28:47.768
You wanted to get out of the trailer park,
be a Southern socialite.

28:47.851 --> 28:49.770
- I helped you do that.
- I know, I know.

28:49.853 --> 28:52.940
But once you made me over,
then I became your creation,

28:53.023 --> 28:55.442
and I've been on autopilot ever since.

28:55.525 --> 28:56.777
That doesn't justify sleeping...

28:56.860 --> 28:59.863
No, I know that,
but it made me realize that...

29:00.697 --> 29:04.159
Bob, I've gotta stop playing dress-up

29:04.493 --> 29:06.203
and be who I am.

29:06.578 --> 29:08.914
You know, but the only trouble is,

29:09.831 --> 29:12.042
I've been role-playing for so long,

29:12.125 --> 29:13.919
I don't even know who that is.

29:16.964 --> 29:17.798
Okay.

29:19.174 --> 29:20.384
So I've been thinking...

29:22.135 --> 29:24.513
you know, with WMBS.

29:26.139 --> 29:27.599
I wanna start working.

29:28.558 --> 29:30.727
- Maybe be a mompreneur.
- What the hell?

29:30.811 --> 29:32.104
This is what I do.

29:32.187 --> 29:35.524
I can help you be the best "you"
you can be.

29:38.527 --> 29:40.070
Thank you, but I...

29:42.197 --> 29:44.241
I think I need to do this on my own.

29:46.451 --> 29:47.995
You mean, without me?

29:49.621 --> 29:50.998
No, Bob, not forever.

29:52.791 --> 29:55.877
I just need some space to figure this out.

29:58.046 --> 30:00.007
Can you love me enough to give me that?

30:06.888 --> 30:08.682
It's so fucking inappropriate.

30:08.807 --> 30:10.934
Who are you, and why are you
making out in my kitchen?

30:12.811 --> 30:15.230
Excuse us.

30:16.982 --> 30:19.568
I'm Pastor Mike Keene,

30:19.943 --> 30:22.112
and this is my wife Gayle.

30:22.195 --> 30:23.488
And we are friends of your parents.

30:23.864 --> 30:26.408
Keene? Are you Christian's parents?

30:27.034 --> 30:29.036
Well, yes. You know our son?

30:29.786 --> 30:32.456
Christian's dad's a pastor. Classic.

30:32.539 --> 30:33.749
Let me ask you something.

30:33.832 --> 30:37.294
What would Jesus say
about your son practicing black magic?

30:45.135 --> 30:46.470
This assembly is bullshit.

30:46.803 --> 30:49.306
I got bullied for years.
Nobody did anything about it.

30:49.890 --> 30:51.475
You should invoke the wrath of Kitty,

30:52.142 --> 30:53.143
make them all pay.

30:53.602 --> 30:56.438
Maybe you need to eat her name
every time you wanna call on her.

30:58.815 --> 30:59.649
Dad?

31:00.484 --> 31:02.611
Sorry, he said it was an emergency.

31:02.694 --> 31:05.113
I know you two have been
practicing the black arts.

31:05.197 --> 31:07.741
- Wait, what?
- I can't believe you're doing this again.

31:07.824 --> 31:08.867
And with her?

31:09.409 --> 31:11.536
I told you to stay away.

31:11.995 --> 31:14.748
As long as you live under my roof,
you'll do as you're told.

31:14.831 --> 31:16.083
Car, now!

31:20.170 --> 31:22.506
I'm confused. The black arts?

31:22.589 --> 31:24.674
He thinks my teratoma's a demon,

31:24.883 --> 31:26.635
and he wants me to get an exorcism.

31:27.052 --> 31:30.222
- Yeah, get the fuck out of my house.
- Don't dismiss this, Angie.

31:31.264 --> 31:33.850
Do you know if there's any darkness
in your lineage?

31:37.062 --> 31:38.063
I mean it, Patty.

31:38.730 --> 31:41.983
The demon seduces you,
makes you think you're in charge,

31:42.067 --> 31:43.985
but eventually, it takes over.

31:44.569 --> 31:46.029
And people around you will get hurt.

31:47.614 --> 31:48.740
Get the exorcism...

31:49.741 --> 31:50.659
before it's too late.

31:57.707 --> 31:58.583
Patty...

31:59.584 --> 32:01.711
every 17-year-old goes through this.

32:01.795 --> 32:03.922
You watch <i> The Craft,</i>
you get a spirit board,

32:04.005 --> 32:05.841
you take your shot at casting spells.

32:05.924 --> 32:06.925
It doesn't mean it's real.

32:08.176 --> 32:10.262
Except, what if it is?

32:11.555 --> 32:12.389
Patty...

32:16.768 --> 32:19.271
the only real demons are the ones
from our past.

33:11.823 --> 33:15.494
Armstrong, I know you told my dad
Patty and I were doing black magic.

33:15.702 --> 33:16.536
So?

33:16.620 --> 33:19.122
Stop trying to keep me and Patty apart.

33:19.539 --> 33:20.749
She chose the better man.

33:21.291 --> 33:22.501
- Wrong.
- Wanna prove it?

33:23.877 --> 33:26.546
- Hey!
- Really? Stop it!

33:26.630 --> 33:30.175
You're going to fight
at an anti-bullying assembly?

33:30.300 --> 33:32.886
Take your seats. Now!

33:36.139 --> 33:42.771
Welcome to Masonville High's
first annual anti-bullying assembly.

33:43.563 --> 33:46.525
As you know,
there's a Category 4 storm on the way,

33:46.608 --> 33:49.277
so we will be having
an early dismissal today.

33:49.361 --> 33:51.446
I know, I know.

33:52.656 --> 33:54.324
<i>I wanted to believe Christian.</i>

33:54.407 --> 33:56.993
<i>That I was magical, powerful.</i>

33:57.077 --> 34:00.330
<i>But then why did I have to apologize
in front of the whole school?</i>

34:00.539 --> 34:03.708
<i>I was the victim, not Dixie Sinclair.</i>

34:04.876 --> 34:05.835
Hey.

34:06.920 --> 34:09.047
Thanks for coming.
My mom had to work.

34:09.130 --> 34:10.674
I've always got your back.

34:11.174 --> 34:13.342
Which is why we should talk
about Christian.

34:13.885 --> 34:15.804
I heard a weird thing
about him last night.

34:15.887 --> 34:18.139
Patty Bladell, join us, please.

34:21.810 --> 34:22.851
Tell me later.

34:24.228 --> 34:27.482
<i>If Kitty was real,
I needed her now more than ever.</i>

34:28.858 --> 34:29.985
Patty Bladell.

34:37.033 --> 34:41.788
Bullying has become the scourge
of our school.

34:42.621 --> 34:46.333
Some of our students have learned
the dire consequences of fighting.

34:46.668 --> 34:49.004
One, obviously more than the other.

34:50.505 --> 34:53.632
And now I give you the amazing...

34:54.384 --> 34:56.052
Dixie Sinclair.

35:00.515 --> 35:03.602
<i>I couldn't believe
people were cheering for Dixie.</i>

35:03.685 --> 35:05.770
<i>Even the principal was taking sides.</i>

35:07.814 --> 35:12.527
I once read that the weak
can never forgive...

35:13.653 --> 35:16.948
because forgiveness
is only for the strong.

35:18.408 --> 35:19.784
As the victim...

35:20.702 --> 35:21.536
We love you, Dixie!

35:22.078 --> 35:22.954
It's okay.

35:24.039 --> 35:25.373
As the victim...

35:25.707 --> 35:28.251
- <i>Victim? Dixie wasn't a victim.</i>
- of this tragedy...

35:28.543 --> 35:30.629
<i>She made fun of me when I was fat.</i>

35:30.837 --> 35:32.589
<i>She lied about being molested.</i>

35:32.714 --> 35:34.633
<i>She was always a lying bitch.</i>

35:34.716 --> 35:36.843
<i>Just now she was a bitch on wheels.</i>

35:37.719 --> 35:38.553
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

35:39.763 --> 35:41.681
<i>What if she was lying right now?</i>

35:42.182 --> 35:44.267
<i>What if that was why
she didn't press charges</i>

35:44.351 --> 35:46.394
<i>and wouldn't let anyone come see her?</i>

35:46.561 --> 35:48.229
<i>Could she be making it all up?</i>

35:48.647 --> 35:50.899
<i>The neck brace, the wheelchair,</i>

35:50.982 --> 35:52.192
<i>the change of heart?</i>

35:52.776 --> 35:54.986
<i>It was the only thing that made sense.</i>

35:55.528 --> 35:58.490
<i>- I couldn't believe everyone fell for it.</i>
- Look inside yourself...

35:58.865 --> 36:02.285
Dixie Sinclair is not the victim here.
Okay? I am.

36:02.369 --> 36:03.286
Uh-oh.

36:03.370 --> 36:05.789
When I was bullied for being fat,

36:05.872 --> 36:07.874
did anyone apologize to me?

36:08.291 --> 36:09.125
No.

36:09.334 --> 36:12.504
Because nobody cares about bullying.

36:13.296 --> 36:16.132
Not unless you're pretty
or rich or special.

36:16.216 --> 36:19.886
But if you're fat
or ugly or just uncool...

36:20.595 --> 36:22.472
you just let them suffer.

36:23.723 --> 36:25.892
For years, just like I did.

36:27.519 --> 36:29.521
Dixie Sinclair is full of shit.

36:29.771 --> 36:32.941
Just like everyone else in this town.
You're all fakes.

36:33.024 --> 36:34.776
And Dixie is the biggest fake of all!

36:35.568 --> 36:39.280
You're gonna pay for that!

36:39.364 --> 36:41.825
Oh, Mama! Oh, my baby!

36:41.908 --> 36:44.869
<i>Oh, my God.
She was telling the truth.</i>

36:45.036 --> 36:48.331
<i>Which meant I had just made things
so much worse.</i>

36:49.541 --> 36:50.750
Oh, my God, look at her!

36:50.834 --> 36:52.335
<i>Kitty was real all right...</i>

36:53.044 --> 36:55.255
<i>and she completely fucked me over.</i>

36:57.382 --> 36:59.008
<i>I was totally freaked out.</i>

36:59.342 --> 37:01.344
<i>I knew there was only one thing
left to do.</i>

37:01.428 --> 37:03.471
How could you? Are you insane?

37:03.638 --> 37:05.348
It wasn't me. It was my demon.

37:06.057 --> 37:08.226
- I'm sorry.
- I'm telling you, I'm possessed.

37:08.601 --> 37:11.146
Pastor Mike said people around me
were going to get hurt,

37:11.229 --> 37:12.731
and now it's happening.

37:13.273 --> 37:14.858
I need an exorcism.

37:15.483 --> 37:17.736
You don't need an exorcism.
You need therapy.

37:18.111 --> 37:18.987
Are you okay?

37:19.070 --> 37:23.116
That was, like, the worst thing I ever saw
anyone do to anyone, ever.

37:23.533 --> 37:25.285
See? I'm calling Pastor Mike.

37:25.827 --> 37:26.828
Hopefully he can get a hold

37:26.911 --> 37:28.163
of Father Schwartz
and we can do the exorcism.

37:28.621 --> 37:31.791
I'm sorry, did she say "exorcism"
and "Father Schwartz"?

37:32.167 --> 37:34.210
Explain it to him
and then meet me in the science lab.

37:34.294 --> 37:35.920
It's the most remote classroom in school.

37:38.298 --> 37:41.801
<i>I didn't believe in demons,
but I did believe in Patty.</i>

37:41.885 --> 37:45.180
<i>So if this is what it took
to get her over the hump to regionals,</i>

37:45.263 --> 37:47.390
<i>I was willing to play along.</i>

37:51.811 --> 37:55.774
We could clear one of the lab tables
and have Patty lay on it.

37:56.524 --> 37:59.444
Does she need to lay down?
Can a person have an exorcism sitting up?

37:59.527 --> 38:01.237
Maybe this is a bad idea.

38:02.322 --> 38:03.990
Patty, my dad called me.

38:04.073 --> 38:05.742
Said he's coming here to do an exorcism?

38:05.825 --> 38:08.620
- That's crazy.
- Exactly. Listen to your boyfriend.

38:08.703 --> 38:11.748
This demon is our thing.
You can't get rid of it.

38:12.248 --> 38:13.708
On second thought, don't.

38:17.212 --> 38:19.923
I thought you were going to
embrace yourself fully.

38:20.673 --> 38:22.801
So you could love yourself
like I love you.

38:22.884 --> 38:24.344
- I want it out.
- No.

38:25.303 --> 38:27.514
- You can't.
- Why are you being so controlling?

38:29.182 --> 38:31.017
I'm scared if you get rid of Kitty...

38:31.851 --> 38:33.061
you'll get rid of me, too.

38:38.775 --> 38:40.610
- Pastor Mike.
- <i>Yeah, I'm on my way,</i>

38:40.693 --> 38:43.321
<i>but the storm may keep Father Schwartz
from getting there.</i>

38:43.404 --> 38:45.824
- Well, then who will do my exorcism?
- <i>I will.</i>

38:46.616 --> 38:49.619
But you've never done one before.
I don't want a rookie exorcist.

38:49.702 --> 38:53.998
<i>Don't worry. Faith can overcome any demon,
no matter how strong.</i>

38:54.082 --> 38:56.417
<i>Oh, God!</i>

38:57.418 --> 38:58.878
- Dad!
- Pastor Mike.

38:59.546 --> 39:00.713
Pastor Mike!

39:01.881 --> 39:04.884
You gotta go.
Call your mom, make sure your dad's okay.

39:05.176 --> 39:07.720
- I want to stay with Patty.
- Why? The accident was my fault.

39:07.804 --> 39:10.223
My demon is trying to keep itself
from being exorcised.

39:10.306 --> 39:12.642
It's the storm. The roads are slick.

39:12.725 --> 39:15.019
Christian, please,
go take care of your family.

39:15.103 --> 39:16.771
It's not like there's anything
I can do about it.

39:16.855 --> 39:18.356
Christian, go!

39:19.983 --> 39:21.359
I have to get this thing out of me.

39:21.693 --> 39:24.153
Okay? Pastor Mike's not coming
and neither is Father Schwartz.

39:24.445 --> 39:26.364
- You have to do it.
- Me? No.

39:26.447 --> 39:27.824
What about Nonnie or Choi?

39:27.907 --> 39:28.783
- No way.
- Don't look at me.

39:29.868 --> 39:32.161
You've seen <i> The Exorcist, </i> right?
And we have Google.

39:32.245 --> 39:33.663
Patty, this is insane.

39:33.746 --> 39:35.373
I thought you said you had my back.

39:38.835 --> 39:39.961
<i>She was desperate,</i>

39:40.044 --> 39:43.715
<i>and the longer I stayed with Patty,
the longer I stayed away from Barnard.</i>

39:43.923 --> 39:46.134
<i>Besides, I knew how to play a role.</i>

39:46.217 --> 39:49.429
Choi. Get to the Drama Department.
They never throw anything away.

39:49.846 --> 39:52.307
I did a production
of <i>The Thorn Birds</i> in the '80s.

39:52.390 --> 39:53.224
It was amazing.

39:53.433 --> 39:55.018
Get me my priest costume!

39:59.063 --> 40:02.108
Signs of possession include a foul odor,

40:02.567 --> 40:05.153
vomiting, repeated pleas to stop...

40:05.236 --> 40:08.114
- She doesn't have any of those symptoms.
- It says we should tie her down.

40:08.197 --> 40:10.033
- Don't tie me down.
- Okay, there's one.

40:10.366 --> 40:11.576
I found your costume.

40:12.243 --> 40:14.287
And I got some other stuff, too.

40:15.330 --> 40:19.375
Candles, crosses,
incense, a plastic sword...

40:20.126 --> 40:23.004
holy water. Well, bottled water.

40:23.588 --> 40:25.506
Hey, look. It still fits.

40:28.259 --> 40:31.679
<i>Compared to my own problems,
an exorcism seemed simple.</i>

40:31.763 --> 40:36.684
In the name of the Father, the Son
and the Holy Spirit, I bless this water.

40:36.768 --> 40:40.855
May it heal and sanctify
all it touches. Amen.

40:41.147 --> 40:42.065
- Amen.
- Amen.

40:45.151 --> 40:46.819
- Seriously?
- Sorry.

40:47.737 --> 40:49.113
Okay, repeat after me.

40:49.197 --> 40:50.740
Lord have mercy.

40:50.907 --> 40:52.033
- Lord have mercy.
- Lord have mercy.

40:52.116 --> 40:53.910
Christ have mercy.

40:53.993 --> 40:55.703
- Christ have mercy.
- Christ have mercy.

40:55.787 --> 40:56.829
Lord have mercy.

40:56.913 --> 40:58.039
- Lord have mercy.
- Lord have mercy.

40:58.122 --> 41:00.667
Okay, this goes on for a while.
Let's just cut to the chase.

41:00.750 --> 41:03.252
Depart, then, O impious one.

41:03.544 --> 41:05.380
Depart, accursed one.

41:05.463 --> 41:07.757
Depart with all your deceit,

41:07.840 --> 41:11.970
for God has willed
that man should be his temple.

41:17.016 --> 41:18.893
I smell a foul odor.

41:19.727 --> 41:21.104
I think the demon's here.

41:21.187 --> 41:23.690
That's me. Too many Leaner Wieners.

41:24.607 --> 41:26.234
No more soy for Choi.

41:26.693 --> 41:28.569
Guys, let's stay focused here.

41:28.653 --> 41:31.948
As humble servants of God,
we cast you out. Repeat.

41:32.031 --> 41:34.909
As humble servants of God,
we cast you out.

41:34.993 --> 41:37.996
As humble servants of God,
we cast you out.

41:38.329 --> 41:40.623
As humble servants of...

41:42.375 --> 41:44.252
We're all gonna die!

41:44.877 --> 41:48.589
I don't feel good.
I've been eating a lot of paper.

41:48.881 --> 41:50.967
- Patty, what's happening?
- I think I'm gonna be sick.

41:51.342 --> 41:52.802
- Can you untape me?
- No, no, don't!

41:52.969 --> 41:54.929
It could be the demon trying to resist...

41:55.013 --> 41:57.181
Oh, great, now you got me buying
into all this.

41:57.265 --> 41:58.224
Let me up!

42:02.729 --> 42:05.898
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

42:06.190 --> 42:08.026
I cast you out, demon!

42:08.985 --> 42:10.695
The power of Christ compels you!

42:10.778 --> 42:12.864
The power of Christ compels you!

42:12.947 --> 42:14.949
The power of Christ compels you!

42:21.622 --> 42:23.666
Is the demon gone?

42:35.720 --> 42:36.846
Shalom.

42:37.555 --> 42:38.848
What'd I miss?

42:38.931 --> 42:41.350
Let me guess. Father Schwartz?

42:41.768 --> 42:42.935
In the flesh.

42:43.186 --> 42:46.022
I... think I cast out the demon.

42:47.231 --> 42:50.359
Oy! Everybody's an exorcist.

42:51.402 --> 42:52.445
But you never know.

42:53.863 --> 42:56.324
So let's have a quick look-see, shall we?

43:02.163 --> 43:04.832
Hmm. Open, please.

43:07.752 --> 43:08.878
No, no demon.

43:10.046 --> 43:11.464
So, I did it.

43:12.048 --> 43:13.174
I'm an exorcist?

43:13.257 --> 43:15.468
There probably never was a demon
in the first place.

43:15.551 --> 43:19.722
Wait, are you saying
there's no such thing as demons?

43:20.139 --> 43:22.767
No, demons are real,
but they're very rare.

43:23.309 --> 43:25.394
In my entire career, I have had maybe...

43:26.229 --> 43:28.815
three cases of authentic possessions.

43:29.357 --> 43:32.819
How could there not be a demon?
The spirit board said...

43:32.902 --> 43:35.947
"The spirit board said." Whatever it said,
it was your subconscious talking.

43:36.030 --> 43:38.741
But I dumped a paralyzed girl out
of a wheelchair.

43:38.825 --> 43:40.993
Then that,<i> bubela, </i> is on you.

43:42.245 --> 43:44.872
I know it's a bitter pill to swallow,

43:45.039 --> 43:46.749
that there's no one else to blame,

43:47.333 --> 43:49.544
but sometimes the truth hurts.

43:49.961 --> 43:53.589
Most of the time, when someone
thinks they have a demon...

43:54.590 --> 43:56.634
they're just fighting against a part
of themselves...

43:57.760 --> 43:59.095
they refuse to accept.

44:01.722 --> 44:02.765
You understand?

44:06.519 --> 44:10.773
<i>If Father Schwartz had said demons
were real, maybe bisexuals were, too.</i>

44:11.357 --> 44:14.610
<i>Maybe there was a part of myself
I had refused to accept.</i>

44:32.837 --> 44:34.005
I love my wife.
