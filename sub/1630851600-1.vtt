02:30.877 --> 02:33.113
This is my daughter.

02:33.147 --> 02:34.548
Hey. Hey.

02:34.582 --> 02:36.183
Just give me a second, okay?

02:36.217 --> 02:38.185
You have any shop experience?

02:38.219 --> 02:40.288
Uh, yes, sir.

02:40.321 --> 02:42.088
Antonio leblanc.

02:42.122 --> 02:44.090
How you get a last name
like that?

02:44.124 --> 02:45.393
I was adopted.

02:45.426 --> 02:47.295
- Hey.
- Where you from?

02:47.328 --> 02:49.597
Uh, I'm from about an hour
north of Baton Rouge.

02:49.630 --> 02:52.433
You know, small town
called St. francisville.

02:52.466 --> 02:54.901
And where you from? Like, born?

02:54.934 --> 02:58.239
I see what you mean.
Uh, I was born in Korea.

02:58.272 --> 03:00.907
- Leblanc.
- Yes, sir.

03:00.940 --> 03:02.176
Yeah, I mean...

03:02.209 --> 03:04.211
I...

03:05.111 --> 03:07.315
Says here you have two felonies.

03:07.348 --> 03:11.017
Uh, y-yeah, but they were
for nonviolent crimes.

03:11.051 --> 03:13.187
You know,
I wouldn't hurt nobody.

03:13.220 --> 03:15.222
What'd you steal?

03:15.256 --> 03:17.591
Um...

03:17.625 --> 03:19.859
You know,
I can fix just about anything.

03:19.893 --> 03:21.861
You know, I can fix
motorcycles, you know, cars.

03:21.895 --> 03:24.231
- Hell, I can fix a lawn...
- What'd you steal?

03:24.265 --> 03:27.635
Motorcycles.
You know, but that was...

03:27.668 --> 03:28.968
A long time ago.

03:29.002 --> 03:30.070
You know, I could...

03:30.103 --> 03:31.938
If you give me a chance,

03:31.971 --> 03:34.974
you know, I could be
a real asset to your workplace.

03:35.008 --> 03:37.211
I don't think so.

03:38.978 --> 03:41.215
Sir, you got kids?

03:41.248 --> 03:43.250
I've got a couple.

03:43.284 --> 03:44.652
Um...

03:44.685 --> 03:47.488
I got this baby on the way,

03:47.521 --> 03:50.191
and I'm just looking
for another job.

03:52.025 --> 03:53.627
Where you work at now?

03:53.661 --> 03:56.062
Tattoo parlor.

03:56.930 --> 03:59.400
I think you're better off there.

04:01.369 --> 04:03.404
Can't help you.

04:05.406 --> 04:07.974
Okay. Thank you.

04:08.007 --> 04:10.411
Come on, let's go.

04:33.567 --> 04:35.001
Keep up! Come on!

04:35.034 --> 04:37.971
Baby, you're gonna need
to sign up first.

04:38.004 --> 04:39.306
You need to come back!

04:44.978 --> 04:47.113
She looks healthy.

04:47.148 --> 04:48.682
"She"?

04:48.716 --> 04:50.718
Yeah, it's a girl.

04:53.721 --> 04:56.157
- Okay, we can wipe off the gel.
- Wait.

04:56.190 --> 04:59.593
Can we hold a minute?
My husband's almost here.

05:01.529 --> 05:03.173
- Jessie, what's the room number?
- How would I know?

05:03.197 --> 05:05.166
- I wrote it on your hand!
- Oh.

05:05.199 --> 05:07.435
- Uh, 67!
- Okay, come on.

05:07.468 --> 05:10.404
- Two doors down, baby girl!
- We found it!

05:10.438 --> 05:12.706
He's here.

05:18.379 --> 05:20.013
It's a girl.

05:27.588 --> 05:29.190
<i>Fear tonight</i>

05:29.223 --> 05:31.592
after what was the largest
workplace immigration raid

05:31.625 --> 05:33.661
in a single state
in U.S. history.

05:33.694 --> 05:35.129
Some undocumented immigrants

05:35.162 --> 05:37.063
in Mississippi locked themselves

05:37.096 --> 05:38.265
in their homes today...

05:38.299 --> 05:40.434
Forgot your last name?

05:40.468 --> 05:42.136
Hmm?

05:42.169 --> 05:45.272
Looks like you're having
a hard time there.

05:46.774 --> 05:49.477
Yeah.

05:49.510 --> 05:51.978
I can't read.

05:58.519 --> 06:01.455
Dad, help. It's stuck.

06:04.358 --> 06:06.760
- Come on.
- You're gonna break it!

06:06.794 --> 06:09.196
Here, let me help.

06:18.172 --> 06:20.174
She did it!

06:20.207 --> 06:22.376
You want those chips that bad?

06:22.409 --> 06:23.644
Hey, what you say?

06:23.677 --> 06:25.145
Thank you.

06:25.179 --> 06:26.647
You're welcome.

06:26.680 --> 06:28.349
You look like my daddy.

06:29.316 --> 06:31.652
- Uh, yes, I do.
- Hey.

06:31.685 --> 06:33.119
That ain't polite to say.

06:33.153 --> 06:34.588
I like your hair.

06:34.622 --> 06:37.056
- Thank you.
- We're having a baby. It's a girl.

06:37.090 --> 06:38.659
Well, congratulations.

06:38.692 --> 06:41.529
- You'll have a baby sister.
- Well, you gonna

06:41.562 --> 06:43.397
tell her where we live now?

06:43.430 --> 06:45.064
Okay. Come on.

06:45.098 --> 06:47.268
It's time to go. Well, uh,

06:47.301 --> 06:48.845
- thank you. What's-what's your name?
- Uh,

06:48.869 --> 06:50.638
- Parker.
- Parker? Antonio.

06:50.671 --> 06:52.640
Nice to meet you.

06:52.673 --> 06:55.242
Come on.

06:56.710 --> 07:00.714
You want me to come
and help out for a few days?

07:00.748 --> 07:03.751
Yeah. Yeah, that would be nice.

07:03.784 --> 07:06.186
Okay.

07:06.220 --> 07:08.188
- Yeah.
- Where you going, mawmaw?

07:08.222 --> 07:11.659
Oh, it's time
for me to go home, sweetie.

07:11.692 --> 07:14.060
Mwah.

07:50.831 --> 07:52.733
What time is it?

07:52.766 --> 07:55.169
It's early. Go back to sleep.

07:55.202 --> 07:57.371
No.

07:57.404 --> 08:00.174
- I have to get Jessie ready.
- No, shh.

08:00.207 --> 08:02.576
- I got it, I got it. I got it.
- Okay.

08:02.610 --> 08:04.588
- I got it. You, you need to rest.
- I'm gonna get up.

08:04.612 --> 08:06.623
- I'm gonna get up.
- No, you gotta get... stay down.

08:06.647 --> 08:08.882
- Stay down.
- Okay.

08:08.916 --> 08:11.652
I got Jessie fed.
I'll get her to school.

08:11.685 --> 08:13.921
- Are you sure?
- Yeah. I'm sure.

08:13.954 --> 08:16.457
- Okay, I got it.
- Okay.

08:16.490 --> 08:18.258
Okay?

08:18.826 --> 08:21.195
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay.

08:21.228 --> 08:23.497
Thank you.

08:26.266 --> 08:30.137
Hey, get dressed.
I'm driving today.

08:38.278 --> 08:40.614
I saw you smoking.

08:44.685 --> 08:47.521
Is that what you're wearing
to school today?

08:47.554 --> 08:49.456
Yeah. Why?

08:50.324 --> 08:51.759
Oh, nothing. It's a good choice.

08:51.792 --> 08:53.227
Come on, let's go.

08:53.260 --> 08:55.195
We're gonna be late.

08:58.599 --> 08:59.933
What's wrong?

08:59.967 --> 09:02.336
I just want to spend
one last day with you

09:02.369 --> 09:04.672
before things change.

09:04.705 --> 09:07.675
- What you mean?
- You know.

09:07.708 --> 09:08.942
Once the baby gets here,

09:08.976 --> 09:10.911
you're gonna pay
less attention to me.

09:10.944 --> 09:13.280
That's not true.
Who told you that?

09:13.313 --> 09:15.282
It's okay. She'll be your kid.

09:15.315 --> 09:16.793
- Hey.
- You're supposed to love her more.

09:16.817 --> 09:20.254
- Hey, hey, stop right there.
- You'll leave me like ace did.

09:28.529 --> 09:29.963
I'm-a love you all the same.

09:29.997 --> 09:33.200
Okay? I ain't going nowhere.
You hear me?

09:35.703 --> 09:37.738
We'll see.

09:41.742 --> 09:44.778
Stay right here.

09:51.452 --> 09:55.322
All right, we're not going
to school today.

09:55.355 --> 09:58.625
<i>Get on.</i>

09:58.659 --> 09:59.993
I'm too short.

10:00.027 --> 10:01.628
Well, you're gonna need to grow,

10:01.662 --> 10:04.598
because I can't be
picking you up all the time.

10:04.631 --> 10:06.433
I'm gonna grow.

10:06.467 --> 10:08.402
I'm gonna grow taller than you.

10:08.435 --> 10:11.672
Then I'm gonna get a motorcycle
that you can't get on.

10:11.705 --> 10:14.575
Oh, yeah?
Well, we'll see about that.

10:34.094 --> 10:35.896
Who be paying $600

10:35.929 --> 10:37.498
on some goddamn shoes?

10:37.531 --> 10:39.375
I mean, what kind of fucking
diamonds they got in 'em?

10:39.399 --> 10:40.777
Don't make no sense, man.
She's the one

10:40.801 --> 10:42.779
that should be paying me,
not the other way around.

10:42.803 --> 10:44.505
- He's talking so much.
- Hear me out, bro.

10:44.538 --> 10:46.774
I been eating
all this nasty-ass healthy food

10:46.807 --> 10:49.376
for about a month now,
and then on top of that,

10:49.409 --> 10:51.512
on top of that,
I been working out

10:51.545 --> 10:52.922
- every other day.
- You want to try?

10:52.946 --> 10:54.414
I ain't missed a day yet.

10:54.448 --> 10:56.650
I mean, shit, look at me.
I mean, I know I look

10:56.683 --> 10:58.919
chiseled like a Greek god, bro.
You can't tell me

10:58.952 --> 11:00.430
- no different.
- You skipped a couple days, merk.

11:00.454 --> 11:01.989
Ain't that some bullshit.

11:02.022 --> 11:03.957
Whoa, man!

11:03.991 --> 11:05.793
Come on, man.
What the fuck you doing?

11:05.826 --> 11:07.461
Hey, man, chill.
I wasn't gonna let her.

11:07.494 --> 11:08.805
- Somebody find a goddamn babysitter.
- Hey.

11:08.829 --> 11:10.764
- Just let the girl tattoo you.
- What?

11:10.798 --> 11:12.542
- All right, you done. Get the hell out of here.
- Shit.

11:12.566 --> 11:13.943
- Get your whining ass out the chair.
- Well,

11:13.967 --> 11:15.578
you come sit right here
and let her tattoo you,

11:15.602 --> 11:17.080
- goddamn it.
- You want to do one on me?

11:17.104 --> 11:18.581
- Let me see this shit.
- Look at it, bro.

11:18.605 --> 11:20.641
- Really? - Yeah.
- Shit look dope, huh?

11:20.674 --> 11:22.509
That look like a dog
took a shit on your back.

11:22.543 --> 11:24.487
- That's what it looks like.
- Fuck you, bro. All day,

11:24.511 --> 11:25.722
- you've been giving me shit.
- Why is you putting that on?

11:25.746 --> 11:27.124
What you mean?
You want to see me naked?

11:27.148 --> 11:28.749
You got to clean it and wrap it.

11:28.782 --> 11:30.760
If you knew what I was dealing
with on a regular day...

11:30.784 --> 11:32.562
- Put it on my hand right here.
- That's why I don't want

11:32.586 --> 11:34.097
- to shake your hand, merk.
- I don't want to shake

11:34.121 --> 11:36.790
- your raggedy hand, either.
- You know I can get shut down

11:36.824 --> 11:38.358
- for this shit.
- Hey, chill out, man.

11:38.392 --> 11:39.960
They're having a parent-child

11:39.993 --> 11:41.495
bonding moment.
Don't mess that up.

11:41.528 --> 11:43.030
How would you know what that is?

11:43.063 --> 11:44.374
Your mama done dropped you
on your head.

11:44.398 --> 11:45.632
Ooh, watch it,

11:45.666 --> 11:47.501
sweetheart.
I'll come back by tomorrow

11:47.534 --> 11:48.969
and shut this whole place down.

11:49.002 --> 11:50.914
You better have papers
for Rodrigo's ass over here,

11:50.938 --> 11:52.606
- 'cause I'll deport him, too.
- Bitch,

11:52.639 --> 11:55.442
I was born here,
old ugly-ass motherfucker.

11:55.475 --> 11:57.711
Shut the fuck up, you
meth head-looking motherfucker.

11:57.744 --> 12:00.480
- Ooh.
- Please, stupid motherfucker.

12:00.514 --> 12:02.449
- Good job.
- Antonio,

12:02.482 --> 12:04.051
you wanted to talk?

12:04.084 --> 12:05.519
Yes, ma'am.

12:05.552 --> 12:07.554
Hey, stay right here, okay?

12:08.655 --> 12:10.891
- What you need?
- You know, I'm having

12:10.924 --> 12:12.993
a baby soon, and, uh,
you know, I was just wondering

12:13.026 --> 12:15.796
if maybe, you know, you could
float me some clients.

12:15.829 --> 12:18.465
I'm... I'm just
a little tight on cash.

12:18.498 --> 12:19.733
How can you ask me for favors

12:19.766 --> 12:21.768
when you haven't paid
your station fees?

12:22.769 --> 12:24.172
Yeah. Okay.

12:24.205 --> 12:25.572
I'm working on it.

12:25.606 --> 12:28.575
- Is that it?
- Yes, ma'am.

12:29.143 --> 12:30.644
What's that thing do?

12:30.677 --> 12:32.913
Oh, this? This so the bad guys
can't hurt me.

12:32.946 --> 12:34.148
You see,

12:34.182 --> 12:37.151
we got a lot of bad people
in this country.

12:37.185 --> 12:39.653
So, my job

12:39.686 --> 12:41.521
is to find them
and kick 'em out.

12:41.555 --> 12:43.123
Why would you tell her that?

12:43.157 --> 12:44.491
She asked me a question.

12:44.524 --> 12:46.059
The only bad guy in here
is you, merk.

12:46.093 --> 12:47.628
Rent-a-cop-looking-ass
motherfucker.

12:47.661 --> 12:49.496
- Yeah, merk!
- Yeah, merk.

12:49.529 --> 12:51.608
- You have bad tattoos.
- You're supposed to be on my side.

12:51.632 --> 12:53.033
Stay out,
deporting motherfucker.

12:53.066 --> 12:54.811
Shit, I'm going to work right
now. I'm done with y'all.

12:54.835 --> 12:56.970
- How's your mom been, Jess?
- She's good.

12:57.004 --> 12:59.439
How come
you don't visit anymore?

12:59.473 --> 13:01.608
You got to ask your mama that.

13:04.077 --> 13:05.179
What is this place?

13:05.213 --> 13:06.480
Where we going?

13:06.513 --> 13:08.782
Uh, it's my secret spot.

13:08.815 --> 13:10.584
- Really?
- Yeah.

13:10.617 --> 13:12.586
Not even your mama know.

13:12.619 --> 13:14.222
Really?

13:14.255 --> 13:15.856
See?

13:15.889 --> 13:17.958
- Look at this.
- Hey.

13:20.961 --> 13:24.097
- Can I go in?
- You want to swim with the gators?

13:24.132 --> 13:26.099
- Yeah.
- I mean, if you think you brave.

13:30.837 --> 13:32.906
Which rock?

13:35.176 --> 13:37.678
- Seriously.
- You trying to skip a rock?

13:37.711 --> 13:39.713
There's no skipping right there.

13:39.746 --> 13:41.158
That just went
straight to the bottom.

13:41.182 --> 13:43.951
Yeah.

13:43.984 --> 13:46.053
Hey, Jessie.

13:46.086 --> 13:48.455
Can I ask you a question?

13:49.190 --> 13:50.958
What you said this morning,

13:50.991 --> 13:53.493
was that a blue thought
or a true thought?

13:53.527 --> 13:54.962
What you mean?

13:54.995 --> 13:58.699
Well, was you saying that
because you was sad,

13:58.732 --> 14:00.968
or you really think that's true?

14:04.738 --> 14:07.040
'Cause, you know,
the real truth is,

14:07.074 --> 14:09.476
I chose you and your mama.

14:11.145 --> 14:12.913
Jessie,

14:12.946 --> 14:15.216
why you call me dad?

14:15.249 --> 14:17.985
- Hmm?
- Because you're my dad.

14:18.018 --> 14:19.987
Because you chose me.

14:20.020 --> 14:21.922
Just like I choose you.

14:21.955 --> 14:23.991
Then why

14:24.024 --> 14:26.893
did you cry at the hospital
when you saw the sonogram?

14:26.927 --> 14:28.595
You never cry for me.

14:28.628 --> 14:30.697
I cry for you all the time.

14:30.731 --> 14:31.832
When?

14:31.865 --> 14:35.303
Like when I see
the way you dance.

14:35.336 --> 14:37.004
When I see the way you run.

14:37.037 --> 14:38.605
Not funny.

14:38.638 --> 14:40.117
When I see how your face
look like in the morning.

14:40.141 --> 14:43.110
When I smell your stinky breath.

14:43.144 --> 14:44.278
- When...
- I brush my teeth!

14:44.312 --> 14:46.646
- Least my head's not small.
- You say

14:46.680 --> 14:48.149
- my head's small?
- No. Don't.

14:48.182 --> 14:49.959
- Oh, you gonna have to pay for that.
- No, I didn't. No.

14:49.983 --> 14:51.594
- You're gonna have to pay for that.
- No, don't! Don't!

14:51.618 --> 14:53.154
You gonna have to pay for that.

14:53.187 --> 14:54.897
- You gonna have to pay for that.
- No, I didn't say that.

14:54.921 --> 14:57.991
One. Two.

14:58.025 --> 15:00.727
- I'm kidding. I'm not gonna do that.
- Obviously.

15:00.761 --> 15:02.163
Where'd the cow go
on a vacation?

15:02.196 --> 15:03.563
Where'd the cow go on vacation?

15:03.597 --> 15:05.299
- Moo York.
- Moo York?

15:05.333 --> 15:07.168
Okay, that was a pretty good one.

15:07.201 --> 15:09.036
Ha! Wait, what?

15:09.069 --> 15:10.338
Hey, be careful. Don't...

15:10.371 --> 15:12.773
Don't... I got you!

15:12.806 --> 15:14.074
You know what this is?

15:14.107 --> 15:15.609
That's Spanish moss.

15:15.642 --> 15:17.911
Oh. Hey!

15:17.944 --> 15:21.249
- Stop tricking me.
- I'm not tricking you.

15:39.966 --> 15:42.903
<i>Take this. This is yours.</i>

15:44.704 --> 15:46.940
Hey, don't tell your mama.

15:46.973 --> 15:48.376
- Okay?
- Okay.

15:52.012 --> 15:53.381
What?

15:53.414 --> 15:56.616
- I believe you now.
- Believe what?

15:56.650 --> 15:58.819
That you're gonna
love us the same.

15:58.852 --> 16:00.620
There's a fly on your face.

16:00.654 --> 16:02.956
Come on, let's go.

16:04.991 --> 16:06.327
<i>How about this one</i>

16:06.360 --> 16:08.162
- right here?
- Beautiful.

16:08.196 --> 16:09.397
Here, put it on my ear.

16:09.430 --> 16:11.399
- Okay.
- You gonna put it on my ear?

16:13.066 --> 16:15.102
- And I'll give you one.
- How I look?

16:15.136 --> 16:17.904
- It looks good.
- Okay.

16:19.005 --> 16:21.708
Hey, now we all have flowers.

16:59.180 --> 17:01.748
Gonna eat it?

17:01.781 --> 17:03.683
- Come on.
- Eat what?

17:09.021 --> 17:13.059
Hey, I was thinking
of going back to work.

17:14.060 --> 17:15.694
Just part-time.

17:22.801 --> 17:24.771
- Hey.
- All right, Kathy,

17:24.804 --> 17:26.839
you need to let me see my daughter.

17:26.873 --> 17:28.909
I told you, she's been sick.

17:28.942 --> 17:30.444
She can't be sick every weekend.

17:30.478 --> 17:33.046
Well, she said she wants
to stay home this weekend.

17:33.079 --> 17:34.781
Kathy, you listen to me

17:34.814 --> 17:35.992
right now. You are gonna let me

17:36.016 --> 17:37.784
see her on Saturday.

17:37.817 --> 17:40.053
- No, ace. I mean it.
- You're trying to keep me

17:40.086 --> 17:41.864
from seeing my daughter,
that's what you're doing.

17:41.888 --> 17:43.457
- No, I'm not.
- Yes, you are.

17:43.491 --> 17:45.259
- Yes, you are.
- Hey, you turned

17:45.293 --> 17:47.461
your back on us. You left us.

17:47.495 --> 17:49.463
You gonna
hold that on me forever?

17:49.497 --> 17:51.332
You don't get a say
in this anymore.

17:51.365 --> 17:53.900
Finished?

17:53.934 --> 17:55.735
- Yeah.
- Don't. Don't you dare

17:55.769 --> 17:57.037
try and put this on him.

17:57.070 --> 17:59.072
He's always been there
for me and Jessie.

17:59.105 --> 18:01.741
No, you can't just call
whenever you want.

18:46.052 --> 18:48.054
Hey.

18:53.059 --> 18:55.795
Everything all right
with Jessie today?

19:04.305 --> 19:05.872
You're doing good.

19:09.243 --> 19:12.946
She told me you were looking
for another job.

19:13.581 --> 19:15.982
Mm.

19:24.057 --> 19:25.159
Hey.

19:26.327 --> 19:29.163
Don't worry.

19:29.196 --> 19:31.332
It'll come.

19:32.300 --> 19:34.468
Okay?

19:38.539 --> 19:42.443
You stay right, and...

19:42.476 --> 19:44.478
Things will work out.

19:44.512 --> 19:46.147
Okay?

19:47.148 --> 19:48.449
I promise.

19:57.558 --> 19:59.260
Hey. You think, uh,

19:59.293 --> 20:02.929
Jessie should spend more time
with ace?

20:04.097 --> 20:07.033
Where's this coming from?

20:07.901 --> 20:10.070
You know, I just think
that maybe...

20:10.103 --> 20:13.174
She need to spend more time
with her daddy.

20:13.207 --> 20:15.008
You're her daddy.

20:15.041 --> 20:17.977
I know.

20:20.147 --> 20:23.451
I mean, I've tried.

20:24.418 --> 20:27.355
I can't make her.

20:27.388 --> 20:30.358
She doesn't want to.

20:37.698 --> 20:41.034
You ever think
about how ace feel?

20:43.404 --> 20:46.474
Not even on my best day.

20:48.142 --> 20:51.178
They barely knew each other.

20:58.985 --> 21:00.287
Kathy.

21:00.321 --> 21:01.689
What's all this? Huh?

21:01.722 --> 21:03.357
Just stuff she wants.

21:03.391 --> 21:04.592
Put it back.

21:04.625 --> 21:06.926
We don't need any of this.

21:06.960 --> 21:08.596
I can do that.

21:08.629 --> 21:10.398
No problem.

21:10.431 --> 21:11.399
Bye.

21:11.432 --> 21:12.999
Who is that?

21:13.032 --> 21:15.403
Rhonda's just asking
if I can cover her for a day.

21:15.436 --> 21:16.570
Why is she asking you?

21:16.604 --> 21:18.172
"Win a trip to Hawaii"?

21:22.041 --> 21:24.145
Can I have some tapioca pudding?

21:24.178 --> 21:25.146
"Can I have

21:25.179 --> 21:28.114
"some tapioca pudding," what?

21:28.149 --> 21:30.984
Can I have
some tapioca pudding, please?

21:31.619 --> 21:33.187
No.

21:33.220 --> 21:35.656
Now put it back, okay?

21:35.689 --> 21:36.657
Here.

21:36.690 --> 21:38.159
Jessie, now hurry up.

21:38.192 --> 21:40.227
We've got to pick stuff up
from grandma's.

21:45.599 --> 21:47.577
Hey. Hey, you get the picture
I sent you last night?

21:47.601 --> 21:49.170
- Picture? Picture of what?
- Yeah.

21:49.203 --> 21:51.971
Of the sausage.
So, it's a kind of andouille.

21:52.005 --> 21:53.674
Yeah, some new cajun shit.

21:53.707 --> 21:55.509
I picked it up at winn-Dixie.

21:55.543 --> 21:57.010
Look at that.

21:57.043 --> 21:58.588
Why are you showing me
a picture of that?

21:58.612 --> 22:00.724
Huh? You got to order this shit
online, it's so fucking good.

22:00.748 --> 22:02.416
- You get your sausage online?
- Huh?

22:02.450 --> 22:04.685
Yeah, well, when it's premium
sausage like this, I do.

22:04.718 --> 22:06.320
Yes. That's for sure.

22:06.353 --> 22:10.089
Hey. Hey,
why don't we go on a trip?

22:11.325 --> 22:13.394
Why don't we decide what
we're gonna buy for dinner?

22:13.427 --> 22:16.363
No, I'm serious. We never been
on a family vacation, okay?

22:16.397 --> 22:17.631
I'd love that.

22:17.665 --> 22:19.667
But... we can't afford it.

22:19.700 --> 22:22.203
- Chips, chips, chips...
- Yes, we can. - With what money?

22:22.236 --> 22:24.305
I'll sell my bike.

22:24.338 --> 22:26.340
Okay.

22:29.075 --> 22:30.377
<i>Okay, excuse me, folks.</i>

22:30.411 --> 22:32.446
We're on duty.
We're gonna need some service.

22:32.480 --> 22:36.484
Uh, hey, you guys have any
of the premium sausages?

22:36.517 --> 22:37.718
Hey, where you want to go?

22:37.751 --> 22:39.487
- Just stop. Just stop.
- Hawaii!

22:39.520 --> 22:43.089
Just... you don't think I want
to be the fun parent, too, huh?

22:43.122 --> 22:44.225
Let's go to Hawaii.

22:44.258 --> 22:46.427
Hey, what you need
to go to Hawaii?

22:46.460 --> 22:49.497
- I might need some sunscreen and bathing suits.
- Stop it.

22:49.530 --> 22:50.731
Bathing suit. What else?

22:50.764 --> 22:52.132
Some cheetos.

22:52.166 --> 22:53.400
Cheetos?

22:53.434 --> 22:55.469
Hey! I'm done, okay?

22:55.503 --> 22:57.046
Let me show you a picture.
Something like that.

22:57.070 --> 22:58.372
I asked you a question.

22:58.405 --> 23:00.441
Did-did you take Jessie
to school yesterday?

23:00.474 --> 23:03.310
'Cause I got a call saying
she never showed up.

23:03.344 --> 23:06.079
We needed to spend
some time together, okay?

23:06.112 --> 23:08.415
We needed to spend
some time together.

23:08.449 --> 23:10.251
You need to be her parent,
not her friend.

23:10.284 --> 23:11.828
I mean, of course
I want you to spend time

23:11.852 --> 23:13.254
- with her, but...
- Kathy?

23:20.361 --> 23:23.062
She don't look that sick to me.

23:23.697 --> 23:24.732
Hey, baby.

23:24.765 --> 23:25.833
Hey, darling.

23:25.866 --> 23:27.501
Hey, where you going?

23:27.535 --> 23:28.678
- Where you going, baby?
- What's going on here?

23:28.702 --> 23:29.837
- Huh?
- It's okay.

23:29.870 --> 23:32.105
What's going on here?

23:32.139 --> 23:33.641
Hey, isn't that your kid?

23:33.674 --> 23:35.276
Y... nah, it's okay, Denny.

23:35.309 --> 23:37.311
Oh. You the guy who
won't let him see his child.

23:37.344 --> 23:39.146
- Den, just go wait in the car.
- No, no, no.

23:39.179 --> 23:40.357
- Let's figure this out.
- Just go wait in the car, Denny.

23:40.381 --> 23:42.182
We all here.
Let's figure this out.

23:42.216 --> 23:43.693
Why don't you go wait
in the car while we talk, okay?

23:43.717 --> 23:46.487
What'd you say to me? Listen,
I'm an officer of the law.

23:46.520 --> 23:48.398
- You don't tell me what to do.
- Why don't you go wait

23:48.422 --> 23:50.200
- in the car. We talking, okay?
- Okay, you will address me

23:50.224 --> 23:51.401
- as "sir." We can talk.
- We talking. Okay? We talking.

23:51.425 --> 23:53.193
- But you will address me as "sir."
- Okay?

23:53.227 --> 23:55.272
- Okay, okay, let's, let's go.
- "Sir." Let's try it.

23:55.296 --> 23:56.830
- "Sir."
- come on. Let's go.

23:56.864 --> 23:59.175
- And did I say you could leave?
- Bye, baby. Bye, sweetie.

23:59.199 --> 24:01.302
- Don't you walk away from me.
- Bye, honey.

24:01.335 --> 24:03.280
Hey, look, you don't walk away
from an officer of the law.

24:03.304 --> 24:04.838
- Denny. Denny, let's go.
- Stop. Stop!

24:04.872 --> 24:06.440
I'm-a tell you one last time!

24:06.473 --> 24:07.717
- Okay, that's it.
- Jesus fucking Christ, Denny.

24:07.741 --> 24:09.510
Put your arms behind your back.

24:09.543 --> 24:11.712
Stop!

24:11.745 --> 24:14.848
- Let him go!
- Don't hurt him! - Do not resist!

24:14.882 --> 24:16.717
- Ace! Ace, get him off of him!
- No...!

24:16.750 --> 24:19.253
Jesus fucking Christ, Denny.

24:19.286 --> 24:21.488
- No! Don't hurt him!
- Fuck you!

24:21.522 --> 24:24.291
- No! Stop!
- It's okay.

24:24.325 --> 24:25.869
- Daddy!
- Give me your hands. Give me your hand.

24:25.893 --> 24:28.729
- No, daddy! - Get on your knees!
- Ace, what the fuck?!

24:28.762 --> 24:30.197
Do something!

24:30.230 --> 24:31.632
No! Stop!

24:31.665 --> 24:33.634
Don't hurt him!

24:33.667 --> 24:35.402
No!

24:35.436 --> 24:37.504
Stop!

25:27.621 --> 25:29.423
It's okay. It's okay.

25:29.456 --> 25:32.693
Go back to your mama. Okay?

25:55.683 --> 25:57.251
<i>I posted bail.</i>

25:57.284 --> 25:58.686
He should have been out by now.

25:58.719 --> 26:00.487
I'm sorry. It looks
like something came up.

26:00.521 --> 26:02.423
It's just gonna take
a little longer to process.

26:02.456 --> 26:03.833
- Just have a wait.
- What do you mean?

26:03.857 --> 26:05.392
H-How long is this gonna take?

26:05.426 --> 26:07.828
You're just gonna have to wait.
I'm sorry.

26:07.861 --> 26:09.430
Miss?

26:10.864 --> 26:13.400
Miss.

26:13.434 --> 26:17.404
Can you please help me?
I have a little girl here.

26:20.007 --> 26:21.709
Okay. Just give me a second.

26:21.742 --> 26:23.711
I'll try to find out.

26:24.712 --> 26:26.714
Thank you.

26:30.517 --> 26:32.319
Kathy,

26:32.352 --> 26:33.954
I'm gonna take Jessie
to my house.

26:33.987 --> 26:36.356
She should wait here, with me.

26:36.390 --> 26:38.425
This is no place for children.

26:38.459 --> 26:41.462
No, mom, we're gonna wait here
for Antonio.

26:44.732 --> 26:45.999
Okay.

26:46.033 --> 26:47.968
So, it looks
like he's not here anymore.

26:48.001 --> 26:50.003
Ice took him.

26:50.037 --> 26:51.638
- What?
- Yeah.

26:51.672 --> 26:54.608
Immigration and customs
enforcement has him now.

28:01.441 --> 28:04.411
I really wish y'all
would have come to me sooner.

28:04.444 --> 28:06.446
Once a judge makes the decision,

28:06.480 --> 28:07.781
it's hard to get it overturned.

28:07.815 --> 28:11.084
I just don't understand
how they can deport him.

28:11.118 --> 28:13.787
He was adopted.

28:14.621 --> 28:16.557
When'd you come to this country?

28:16.590 --> 28:17.591
1988.

28:17.624 --> 28:19.993
Well, there was a bill
that was passed in 2000

28:20.027 --> 28:23.630
that grants, uh,
citizenship to adoptees,

28:23.664 --> 28:27.000
but it only protects kids
who were adopted after 2000.

28:27.034 --> 28:29.503
Looks like maybe your parents...

28:29.536 --> 28:31.705
They're not my parents.

28:31.738 --> 28:34.741
Well,
whoever had custody of you,

28:34.775 --> 28:37.444
looks like they didn't follow
the proper procedure

28:37.477 --> 28:39.147
to change your status.

28:39.180 --> 28:40.981
How's that his fault?

28:41.014 --> 28:42.816
I'm not saying it's his fault.

28:42.850 --> 28:48.121
It's a loophole dhs is using
to deport people.

28:48.156 --> 28:50.123
You also have a criminal record.

28:50.158 --> 28:51.391
They dropped the charges.

28:51.425 --> 28:52.860
No charges were filed.

28:52.893 --> 28:55.762
No, from before.

28:55.796 --> 28:56.563
He has a past record.

28:56.597 --> 28:59.833
Ice is targeting people
like you,

28:59.867 --> 29:01.735
adopted or not.

29:02.803 --> 29:04.404
- Where were you born?
- Korea.

29:04.438 --> 29:05.739
We're married.

29:05.772 --> 29:07.541
Doesn't that Grant him
citizenship?

29:07.574 --> 29:08.809
Even if you're married,

29:08.842 --> 29:10.577
the proper steps
would've needed to be taken

29:10.611 --> 29:12.646
for him to get a green card
or naturalized.

29:12.679 --> 29:14.414
I don't... I don't...
I don't understand.

29:14.448 --> 29:16.750
Can't we do something
about this?

29:16.783 --> 29:18.752
H-He has two kids.

29:18.785 --> 29:21.021
I mean, listen to him.
Look at him.

29:21.054 --> 29:22.856
- He's American.
- It doesn't matter

29:22.890 --> 29:23.991
what he look like.

29:24.024 --> 29:25.559
It's immigration policy.

29:25.592 --> 29:26.994
I was brought here
when I was three.

29:27.027 --> 29:28.896
I've been here
for over 30 years.

29:28.929 --> 29:31.199
Well, sometimes with
these international adoptions

29:31.232 --> 29:32.866
in the '80s, the...

29:32.900 --> 29:34.878
- The proper paperwork wasn't filed.
- Yeah, but, like...

29:34.902 --> 29:37.804
Like I said, I've been here
for over 30 years.

29:37.838 --> 29:40.174
Okay? Can't you
just tell them that-that...

29:40.208 --> 29:42.542
That I was...
I was adopted by white people.

29:44.945 --> 29:47.014
I understand your frustration.

29:47.047 --> 29:49.150
I really do, but...

29:49.183 --> 29:50.684
That's not how it works.

29:50.717 --> 29:52.186
Now, here are your options.

29:52.220 --> 29:53.453
You can...

29:53.487 --> 29:55.789
Depart voluntarily...

29:55.822 --> 29:56.723
No, fuck that.

29:56.757 --> 30:01.061
And have a chance
of receiving status.

30:01.094 --> 30:03.530
Or you can stay and appeal.

30:03.563 --> 30:04.932
But if you do that

30:04.965 --> 30:07.534
and the judge
don't rule in your favor,

30:07.567 --> 30:11.438
you forfeit any opportunity
to return to this country.

30:12.072 --> 30:13.607
What does that mean?

30:13.640 --> 30:16.543
It means,
if he fights and loses,

30:16.576 --> 30:18.745
he can never come back.

30:34.295 --> 30:36.496
I'm not leaving my family.

30:36.530 --> 30:37.764
At this stage,

30:37.798 --> 30:40.000
we don't have a lot of options.

30:40.968 --> 30:42.569
But let me see

30:42.602 --> 30:45.772
what I can do to get you back
in front of a judge.

30:46.773 --> 30:49.643
So, I need to talk to you
about my retainer fee.

30:49.676 --> 30:52.946
Now, I usually charge $5,000
to start.

30:53.847 --> 30:56.750
And then,
depending on how the case goes,

30:56.783 --> 31:00.754
we can talk about that
at a later time.

31:04.158 --> 31:06.727
You have a right to be here.

31:06.760 --> 31:08.996
You won't have to leave
'cause they made a mistake.

31:09.029 --> 31:11.132
It's not your fault. Okay?

31:11.165 --> 31:12.866
We're gonna figure this out.

31:12.899 --> 31:14.244
I'm gonna borrow some money
from my mom.

31:14.268 --> 31:15.769
- Hey, don't do that.
- Why not?

31:15.802 --> 31:17.604
We already borrowed money
for the bond.

31:17.637 --> 31:19.140
How are we gonna pay
for the lawyer?

31:19.173 --> 31:21.275
I'll talk to Ms. Jacci, okay?
Don't worry about it.

31:21.309 --> 31:23.177
Give me the keys.

31:30.817 --> 31:33.587
<i>We barely have enough money.</i>

31:33.620 --> 31:34.797
I can't support two babies
on my own.

31:34.821 --> 31:36.757
Kathy, you're not responsible
for him.

31:36.790 --> 31:38.759
Yes, I am! This isn't right,

31:38.792 --> 31:40.161
what's happening to him.

31:40.194 --> 31:41.928
This is all too much for you.

31:41.962 --> 31:43.630
Well,
they're trying to deport him.

31:43.663 --> 31:44.907
- He's American.
- No, he's not, Kathy.

31:44.931 --> 31:46.933
- He's not American.
- What do you mean?

31:46.967 --> 31:48.035
You know he was adopted.

31:56.009 --> 31:58.612
Hey, baby girl.

32:00.947 --> 32:02.783
Are you okay?

32:02.816 --> 32:04.084
I'm okay.

32:04.117 --> 32:06.119
You?

32:06.154 --> 32:07.687
I'm good.

32:09.656 --> 32:12.059
Are you getting kicked out?

32:16.930 --> 32:18.299
Nah, baby girl.

32:18.332 --> 32:21.068
I ain't going nowhere.

32:38.051 --> 32:39.253
Tattoo!

32:39.287 --> 32:42.589
Tattoo!
Who want a New Orleans tattoo?

32:46.993 --> 32:49.130
See you tonight.

32:51.399 --> 32:54.202
Oh. Oh, baby.

33:01.741 --> 33:02.976
Tattoo! Tattoo!

33:03.009 --> 33:04.245
Who want a tattoo?!

33:04.278 --> 33:05.779
I live on the other side
of the river.

33:05.812 --> 33:06.923
I'm just trying
to make some money.

33:06.947 --> 33:08.682
- Hey, you want a tattoo?
- No, bro.

33:08.715 --> 33:11.852
- No, thank you.
- Who wants a tattoo?!

33:12.453 --> 33:15.055
Y'all want a tattoo?

33:15.088 --> 33:16.923
Hey, who want a tattoo?

33:16.957 --> 33:19.759
Hey. Antonio?

33:22.062 --> 33:24.332
Oh, yeah.
At the hospital. Right?

33:24.365 --> 33:26.766
- Yeah. How are your girls?
- H-Hey.

33:26.800 --> 33:28.034
Excuse me. Hey. Hey.

33:28.068 --> 33:30.003
Tattoo. Yeah,
y'all want some tattoos?

33:30.036 --> 33:32.140
Y'all look like you're in love. Sir.

33:32.173 --> 33:34.708
Tattoo. You want a tattoo?
Come on, man.

33:34.741 --> 33:36.177
Hey. Hey, come on, man.

33:36.210 --> 33:38.745
How-how about I put
a nice eagle on your back.

33:38.778 --> 33:40.181
- Okay?
- I don't need it.

33:40.214 --> 33:41.991
- Come on. You know, you could get a tattoo...
- No.

33:42.015 --> 33:43.460
Come back to the quarter,
get yourself a nice date.

33:43.484 --> 33:45.353
Hey, come on.
I'll do it for cheap.

33:45.386 --> 33:47.388
Hey! I'll do it for cheap!

33:47.421 --> 33:50.023
I'll have a tattoo!

33:53.059 --> 33:55.095
You for real?

33:56.364 --> 33:58.399
You gonna give me
a tattoo or not?

33:58.432 --> 34:00.368
Uh... okay.

34:00.401 --> 34:02.903
Um, but how'd you get here?

34:02.936 --> 34:05.273
Uh, bus.

34:05.306 --> 34:08.108
You scared of motorcycles?

34:09.243 --> 34:11.179
No.

34:11.212 --> 34:12.978
Okay. Well, you know...

34:13.013 --> 34:15.183
Yeah, I only got one helmet
for now, but, uh,

34:15.216 --> 34:19.286
you know, y-you could wear mine
and then I could...

34:30.464 --> 34:31.399
Here.

34:31.431 --> 34:33.733
Yeah, you take this.

34:33.766 --> 34:36.304
Stevie. Put that down, huh?

34:36.337 --> 34:37.971
All right, guys. Come on.

34:38.004 --> 34:41.107
Put the balls away.
Time for lunch.

34:41.141 --> 34:42.842
Good job. Good hustle.

34:42.876 --> 34:45.812
<i>It ain't right,
how Kathy treats you.</i>

34:45.844 --> 34:48.482
I didn't ask for your help.

34:48.516 --> 34:51.117
I was just trying to help you,
trying to put him in his place.

34:51.152 --> 34:53.353
I don't solve my problems
like you, Denny.

34:53.387 --> 34:55.356
Okay?

34:55.389 --> 34:58.159
That's our difference.

35:01.795 --> 35:03.364
Well, because of what I did,

35:03.397 --> 35:06.866
you're probably gonna get to
see your daughter all the time.

35:08.068 --> 35:10.070
What you mean?

35:11.172 --> 35:13.307
He's getting deported.

35:16.310 --> 35:18.246
Yeah, he's a fucking illegal.

35:22.882 --> 35:24.285
Kathy! Kathy. Kathy, you're not

35:24.318 --> 35:26.062
- taking my daughter. Kathy.
- I'll be right back.

35:26.086 --> 35:27.921
No, no, no, no.
You can't come in here.

35:27.954 --> 35:29.466
Are you gonna touch me like...?
Take your hands off me.

35:29.490 --> 35:31.401
- What are you doing here?
- Oh, you gonna deal with me, huh?

35:31.425 --> 35:33.170
- Yeah, I'm gonna deal with you.
- Kathy, I told you all I want

35:33.194 --> 35:35.004
- to do is talk to her.
- Shut up and stop talking.

35:35.028 --> 35:36.406
That's all I want. What makes
that so difficult, huh?

35:36.430 --> 35:37.541
You can't come to my work
and do this.

35:37.565 --> 35:38.575
I can't? It's been three months.

35:38.599 --> 35:40.033
Three fucking months, Kathy.

35:40.066 --> 35:41.901
- It's bullshit.
- I'm not forcing her.

35:41.935 --> 35:43.347
You can't just decide if you
want to be part of her life...

35:43.371 --> 35:44.581
It don't matter! It don't matter

35:44.605 --> 35:46.407
whether...
I-If she wants to or not.

35:46.440 --> 35:49.042
You need to let me
see my daughter.

35:49.075 --> 35:52.012
It's not my fault she doesn't
want to spend time with you.

35:52.045 --> 35:53.856
- That's the situation you created.
- It's my right.

35:53.880 --> 35:55.416
- You weren't around.
- It's my right.

35:55.449 --> 35:59.085
She don't know you.

35:59.119 --> 36:01.888
Get out.

36:01.921 --> 36:06.227
You better not think of
leaving this country with her.

36:08.362 --> 36:11.232
We're not going anywhere.

36:11.265 --> 36:16.102
You're the one
who created this mess.

36:16.137 --> 36:18.004
I'll go back to court
if I have to.

36:18.038 --> 36:19.939
Oh, look, you need to get out.

36:19.973 --> 36:22.008
- You need to get out!
- All right?

36:22.042 --> 36:23.611
- You need to get out of here!
- Okay?

36:23.644 --> 36:26.213
- Get out of here.
- Okay.

36:53.607 --> 36:57.077
- Want to get started?
- Mm-hmm.

36:58.111 --> 37:01.981
Okay. So what you want?

37:02.015 --> 37:04.918
You want a dolphin?

37:04.951 --> 37:07.087
You want a Rose? You want...

37:07.120 --> 37:08.955
"Thug life" on your stomach?

37:08.988 --> 37:10.558
What you want?

37:10.591 --> 37:12.593
I want a Fleur-de-lis.

37:12.626 --> 37:15.463
Oh, fuck, you serious?

37:15.496 --> 37:18.098
Why? What's wrong with that?

37:18.132 --> 37:20.009
Oh, there's nothing wrong
with it. It's just, you know,

37:20.033 --> 37:21.502
you from New Orleans.

37:21.535 --> 37:24.104
It's like getting a palm tree
if you're from California.

37:24.138 --> 37:26.474
Well, that's what I want.

37:27.641 --> 37:30.244
Okay. Where you want it?

37:30.277 --> 37:32.513
Um, on my wrist.

37:32.546 --> 37:35.449
- Right here?
- Mm-hmm.

37:35.483 --> 37:39.052
Okay. Yes, ma'am.

38:03.711 --> 38:05.979
You ready?

38:08.982 --> 38:11.519
Okay.

38:16.590 --> 38:18.024
Oh...

38:19.727 --> 38:23.197
- You okay?
- Yeah.

38:25.199 --> 38:27.701
So, why a Fleur-de-lis?

38:27.735 --> 38:30.571
Um, it's my favorite flower.

38:30.604 --> 38:34.007
Do you know what kind
of flower it is?

38:34.040 --> 38:36.210
Never thought about it.

38:37.278 --> 38:39.413
Thought it was cliché.

38:43.717 --> 38:46.454
You born here?

38:46.487 --> 38:48.988
- No, Vietnam.
- Mm.

38:49.022 --> 38:51.492
Where's that?

38:55.262 --> 38:58.199
I'm kidding. I see y'all around.

39:03.204 --> 39:06.039
You remember anything?

39:06.072 --> 39:09.510
Um, I remember the Fleur-de-lis.

39:09.543 --> 39:11.712
Oh, they got that over there?

39:11.745 --> 39:15.382
- Mm-hmm.
- Hmm.

39:15.416 --> 39:18.385
For your information,
a Fleur-de-lis

39:18.419 --> 39:20.521
is a water Lily.

39:20.554 --> 39:25.426
I used to look at them in
the delta next to my village.

39:25.459 --> 39:29.163
I told myself
if I ever get a tattoo,

39:29.196 --> 39:32.999
that's what I would get...
A Fleur-de-lis.

39:40.508 --> 39:42.676
So why now?

39:42.710 --> 39:44.311
'Cause I'm dying.

39:50.484 --> 39:55.121
What? You thought
I was wearing this wig for fun?

40:05.866 --> 40:07.768
How much I owe you?

40:07.801 --> 40:10.271
It's on me.

40:10.304 --> 40:12.773
What? No, no, no, no.
I want to pay for this.

40:12.806 --> 40:14.575
Here, take it.

40:15.576 --> 40:17.711
No, you know, I ain't gonna
take your money.

40:17.745 --> 40:19.346
Put it back.

40:19.380 --> 40:21.815
You can't offer a service
and not take the money.

40:21.849 --> 40:23.817
We can stand here
and argue all day.

40:23.851 --> 40:26.052
But I ain't gonna
take your money.

40:32.793 --> 40:35.362
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

40:38.365 --> 40:41.067
Do you have a business card?

40:47.341 --> 40:49.843
I get together with my family
once a month

40:49.877 --> 40:52.346
for a big cookout.
You're gonna come and eat.

40:52.379 --> 40:55.182
Bring your family, too.

40:55.215 --> 40:58.285
Don't even think about not
showing up when I call you.

40:58.319 --> 41:01.488
- I'm serious.
- Yes, ma'am.

41:22.643 --> 41:24.878
Yeah!

- I don't think I could...
- I'm getting deported.

41:45.566 --> 41:48.369
You know, I need money

41:48.402 --> 41:50.237
Fuck.

41:52.406 --> 41:56.677
Hey, come on. We gonna
figure something out, bro.

42:35.315 --> 42:36.626
Hey, hey, hey. Calm down.
What? What did you do?

42:36.650 --> 42:39.420
What's going on?
Why's her hair look like that?

42:39.453 --> 42:41.297
She said she wanted to have
the same hair color as you.

42:41.321 --> 42:43.600
- I hate it!
- Why is it bleeding down her face like that?

42:43.624 --> 42:46.493
She did that all on her own. Okay.

42:46.527 --> 42:48.395
Calm down, okay?

42:48.429 --> 42:50.597
We're gonna wash it now.

42:50.631 --> 42:52.599
It's okay. It's okay.

42:53.734 --> 42:56.303
Come here, baby. Come here,
come here, come here.

42:56.336 --> 42:58.706
Hey, Jessie,
it don't look that bad.

42:58.739 --> 43:00.941
- Yes, it does!
- Jessie, it don't look that bad.

43:00.974 --> 43:02.776
That's what I've
been saying, okay?

43:02.810 --> 43:04.778
- It looks interesting.
- Hey.

43:04.812 --> 43:06.880
Hey. Jessie.

43:06.914 --> 43:10.250
Hey. Hey.

43:10.284 --> 43:12.586
Hey. It look like, um,

43:12.619 --> 43:14.722
it look like one of them
movie stars.

43:14.755 --> 43:17.291
- Yeah, you do.
- Really?

43:17.324 --> 43:20.494
Like, uh, uh...

43:20.527 --> 43:23.430
- Who?
- Uh, well, what's her name?

43:23.464 --> 43:25.332
- Uh, Kim...
- Kim?

43:25.365 --> 43:28.502
- Kim.
- Do you know Kim?

43:28.535 --> 43:31.605
Kardashian?

43:31.638 --> 43:33.574
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

43:33.607 --> 43:36.610
- Yeah!
- You totally do. Look at you.

43:36.643 --> 43:38.321
- Kim Kardashian, that's the one.
- Look at you.

43:38.345 --> 43:40.581
- You look like her.
- You're so pretty.

43:40.614 --> 43:42.282
Only a confident person

43:42.316 --> 43:44.551
can have a hair color like that.

43:44.585 --> 43:47.688
I mean, I wish I could
change my hair like that.

43:50.924 --> 43:52.893
- Oh, come on.
- Okay.

43:52.926 --> 43:54.828
- No, I-I take that back.
- Uh-huh.

43:54.862 --> 43:58.365
- Hmm.
- Oh.

43:58.398 --> 44:00.501
I mean, I didn't mean
right... hey.

44:00.534 --> 44:02.402
Come on, don't walk at me
like that.

44:02.436 --> 44:04.071
Don't walk at me like that.

44:04.104 --> 44:05.572
Don't...

44:07.407 --> 44:08.776
Oh, no! Hey, hey.

44:08.809 --> 44:10.911
Come on, have some mercy, okay?

44:10.944 --> 44:13.046
How about let's change it
to black?

44:13.080 --> 44:14.681
- Okay?
- It already is black.

44:14.715 --> 44:17.518
- We're not going to do that.
- How about, uh...

44:17.551 --> 44:19.353
Come on, help me out here.

44:19.386 --> 44:21.989
Daddy needs to keep
his promise now.

44:22.022 --> 44:25.325
- Okay.
- Yeah. I think...

44:25.359 --> 44:28.662
What are we gonna do? Jessie?

44:28.695 --> 44:30.697
What color?

44:32.099 --> 44:33.901
That one?

44:33.934 --> 44:35.536
- Oh, come on.
- Perfect.

44:35.569 --> 44:38.372
- Get that in there, okay? Both... yeah.
- Oh, it's a lot.

44:38.405 --> 44:39.873
- Oh, man.
- Okay.

44:39.907 --> 44:42.075
Use both of your hands
and just get in there.

44:42.109 --> 44:43.677
This is like spreading
with butter.

44:52.153 --> 44:53.687
I like that.

45:14.074 --> 45:15.375
You like your new hair?

45:15.409 --> 45:18.612
- I feel so confident.
- Oh.

45:33.126 --> 45:35.963
You know I'd go to the moon
with you, right?

45:40.534 --> 45:42.803
I ain't scared.

46:26.813 --> 46:29.650
<i>Man, I want to see the pyramids</i>

46:29.683 --> 46:30.793
and shit.
Cave drawings and shit.

46:30.817 --> 46:32.452
Fuck your pyramids, bro.

46:32.486 --> 46:33.930
- Hey, fuck you, man!
- Man, if I'm on vacation,

46:33.954 --> 46:35.498
I ain't trying to see
no fucking pyramids,

46:35.522 --> 46:36.766
riding around in the Van
and shit, bro.

46:36.790 --> 46:38.534
- What the fuck you trying to do?
- Trying to be on

46:38.558 --> 46:40.794
a motherfucking beach sipping
a motherfucking Mai Tai.

46:40.827 --> 46:42.805
Fuck that Mai Tai. You don't
even know what the fuck

46:42.829 --> 46:44.540
a Mai Tai is. Always talking
about a damn Mai Tai.

46:44.564 --> 46:45.909
Don't worry
about it, motherfucker.

46:45.933 --> 46:47.477
I just want to drink the shit,
how about that?

46:47.501 --> 46:49.102
Yo, Antonio!
You know the drill, bro.

46:49.137 --> 46:51.080
For every bike you get, I give
you a thousand dollars.

46:51.104 --> 46:53.674
But if you get any ducatis,
I'll give you two grand.

46:53.707 --> 46:55.943
- Fuck, it's hot!
- Man, y'all need to shut the fuck up,

46:55.976 --> 46:57.687
'cause ain't nobody going
nowhere if y'all don't

46:57.711 --> 46:59.751
- get the job done right.
- Man, fuck you, too, bro!

46:59.780 --> 47:01.548
Mal, bruh,
if you're gonna go somewhere,

47:01.581 --> 47:03.151
you could see some shit, man.

47:03.184 --> 47:04.685
Get some fucking culture!

47:04.718 --> 47:06.095
Expand that little pea-sized
brain of yours.

47:06.119 --> 47:07.821
I am gonna see some shit, bro!

47:07.854 --> 47:09.523
Some big-ass booties

47:09.556 --> 47:10.891
in bikinis right in front of me

47:10.924 --> 47:12.759
on the fucking beach,
with my Mai Tai!

47:12.793 --> 47:14.570
- And all you gonna do is fucking look...
- What the fuck

47:14.594 --> 47:16.563
y'all need to go that far
to see that shit for?

47:16.596 --> 47:18.865
Man, you can see that shit
at Rick's on bourbon,

47:18.899 --> 47:20.234
you dumb-ass basic bitch.

47:20.268 --> 47:22.170
- Tell him.
- Come on, man, we got work to do.

47:22.203 --> 47:23.837
Y'all basic, man. Fuck y'all.

47:23.870 --> 47:27.208
- Fuck all y'all, man.
- With your goofy ass.

47:27.241 --> 47:29.643
Antonio.

47:29.676 --> 47:31.245
Where would you go?

47:31.279 --> 47:34.614
I'd stay the fuck right here.

47:38.752 --> 47:40.954
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go!

47:40.988 --> 47:42.723
Come on, baby!

48:12.919 --> 48:15.223
Antonio!

48:16.790 --> 48:18.658
- Let's go, let's go, let's go!
- Come on, man.

48:18.692 --> 48:20.027
Leave it, leave it, man,
leave it.

48:20.060 --> 48:22.263
Go, let's roll, let's go,
let's roll, let's go,

48:22.296 --> 48:24.298
let's roll, let's go,
let's roll!

48:28.602 --> 48:29.803
What are you doing?! Come on!

48:29.836 --> 48:31.638
- Hurry your ass up!
- Come on!

48:31.671 --> 48:33.307
- Come on!
- Come on!

48:33.341 --> 48:35.809
Come on, man,
drop the fucking bike!

48:35.842 --> 48:38.578
Antonio! The police
coming, man...

48:38.612 --> 48:39.646
I need one more bike!

48:39.679 --> 48:40.814
- Fuck!
- Come on!

48:40.847 --> 48:44.117
- Hold on!
- I'm not leaving him.

48:44.152 --> 48:45.652
Fuck, fuck, fuck!

49:02.035 --> 49:04.604
Police! Freeze! Nopd!

49:04.638 --> 49:07.074
- Come out!
- You're surrounded!

49:59.893 --> 50:01.761
Yo! You break that shit,
you buying it!

50:01.795 --> 50:03.273
- I ain't buying...
- Man, you buying that shit.

50:03.297 --> 50:06.967
Antonio, you nearly got arrested, jefe.

50:08.835 --> 50:11.139
What, you making love
to that motherfucker?

50:11.172 --> 50:13.039
Hurry up, man, shit!

50:13.073 --> 50:15.313
- Let's move, let's move.
- Let's go, let's go, let's go!

51:34.255 --> 51:35.822
<i>I'm in the process</i>

51:35.855 --> 51:37.891
<i>of trying to get you
a merits hearing.</i>

51:37.924 --> 51:40.361
But I want us to start
preparing ahead of time,

51:40.394 --> 51:42.996
just in case we're granted one.

51:43.029 --> 51:44.508
Now, there's some things
that are gonna help

51:44.532 --> 51:46.167
with the hearing,

51:46.200 --> 51:48.145
things that make a great case
for your need to stay.

51:48.169 --> 51:51.905
All right? Do you have
any ailing relatives

51:51.938 --> 51:54.508
- that require your assistance?
- Uh, no.

51:54.542 --> 51:57.378
How about children
under the age of 18

51:57.411 --> 52:00.548
that would be left alone here
if you were to depart?

52:00.581 --> 52:04.084
Uh, yeah, yeah.
I got a-a stepdaughter

52:04.117 --> 52:06.287
and I got a daughter on the way.

52:06.320 --> 52:08.522
But would they be left alone?

52:08.556 --> 52:10.558
Uh, no.

52:10.591 --> 52:15.095
Okay, um, it looks
like you work.

52:15.129 --> 52:16.130
Yeah.

52:16.163 --> 52:18.165
So you're not the sole provider.

52:18.199 --> 52:20.167
Uh, no. We both work.

52:20.201 --> 52:21.935
Oh. Okay.

52:21.968 --> 52:26.006
And you, um, didn't come here
as a refugee,

52:26.039 --> 52:30.177
so there's no threat
of violence in your homeland.

52:30.211 --> 52:33.414
So that doesn't apply.

52:33.447 --> 52:35.149
Okay.

52:35.182 --> 52:37.251
It looks like our
best bet here is, uh,

52:37.285 --> 52:42.856
to try to prove that you are
a valued member of society.

52:42.889 --> 52:46.026
Which is going to be
quite a challenge

52:46.059 --> 52:47.461
because of your criminal record,

52:47.495 --> 52:49.530
but at this point,
it's-it's all...

52:49.563 --> 52:51.165
It's the only option we have.

52:51.198 --> 52:53.167
Now, we're gonna need a lot
of support here.

52:53.200 --> 52:57.070
All right? Friends, family,
uh, parents.

52:57.103 --> 53:00.274
Uh, members of your church
if you attend one.

53:00.308 --> 53:03.109
Anybody that can paint
a picture for the judge

53:03.144 --> 53:07.080
that you're a positive part
of this community.

53:07.113 --> 53:10.050
Yeah, we can get
some people together.

53:10.083 --> 53:14.954
Good. Um, how about
your adoptive parents, Antonio?

53:14.988 --> 53:17.391
They passed away.

53:17.425 --> 53:18.892
Oh, okay.

53:18.925 --> 53:21.529
Any other family members
from your parents' side?

53:21.562 --> 53:26.167
- Uh, aunt, uncle, grandparent?
- Uh, no.

53:26.200 --> 53:29.603
Okay, so we'll just
have to go with what we got.

53:29.637 --> 53:33.507
Were you able to put together
the retainer fee?

53:33.541 --> 53:35.609
So, uh, we were...

53:35.643 --> 53:37.345
Uh, yeah, uh...

53:37.378 --> 53:40.214
I was able to get an advance
from work.

53:52.526 --> 53:55.196
- Man, how you did that shit?
- Man, I told you, man.

53:55.229 --> 53:56.664
Ain't no way
that's the same bike.

53:56.697 --> 53:58.175
You must've did some voodoo
to this shit.

53:58.199 --> 53:59.509
What the fuck you think
I do here, merk?

53:59.533 --> 54:00.634
I thought you just swept,

54:00.668 --> 54:02.102
I didn't know you worked on 'em.

54:02.136 --> 54:03.504
And you got to pay
for this shit.

54:03.537 --> 54:05.415
- Pay for it?
- This ain't no charity shop, merk.

54:05.439 --> 54:07.217
If you're gonna charge me
for it, you could've cleaned

54:07.241 --> 54:09.051
- the motherfucker first.
- Hey, hey, shut that bike off!

54:09.075 --> 54:10.644
I'll impound that shit so fast.

54:10.678 --> 54:12.146
Get over here.

54:12.179 --> 54:13.323
Can I help you officers
with something?

54:13.347 --> 54:15.115
Shut the fuck up.

54:15.149 --> 54:16.983
What the fuck you doing here?

54:17.016 --> 54:21.087
You illegal motherfucker,
ain't they kick you out yet?

54:21.121 --> 54:22.998
- You got a problem, bro?
- Who the fuck are you?

54:23.022 --> 54:24.434
- Ice, bitch. Who are you?
- I don't give a fuck.

54:24.458 --> 54:26.403
I should write you a ticket
for disturbing the peace.

54:26.427 --> 54:27.671
- Write me a ticket? That's cute.
- Yes, sir.

54:27.695 --> 54:28.696
Just like that coconut

54:28.729 --> 54:30.164
you're walking around with.

54:30.197 --> 54:31.399
Yeah, I'm real cute, ain't I?

54:31.432 --> 54:32.700
You guys hear anything about

54:32.733 --> 54:34.402
a dealership getting hit
a few days ago?

54:34.435 --> 54:36.146
- No, sir, we don't know...
- What'd I fucking tell you?

54:36.170 --> 54:38.539
Keep your mouth shut.

54:38.572 --> 54:41.542
I'm talking
to this motherfucker.

54:41.575 --> 54:43.411
You're still getting deported?

54:43.444 --> 54:45.246
- Getting what?
- Oh, shit.

54:45.279 --> 54:49.015
You didn't even know your own
friend was getting deported.

54:49.048 --> 54:51.352
Damn, they must be training you
good over at ice.

54:51.385 --> 54:53.421
Hmm?

54:53.454 --> 54:57.023
If you do get deported,
Jessie stays here.

54:57.056 --> 54:59.034
Now, I don't give a shit
what you do with your own kid.

54:59.058 --> 55:02.396
But Jessie stays here.

55:05.733 --> 55:08.235
I know you stole those bikes.

55:12.339 --> 55:14.007
Come on, Denny, let's go.

55:14.040 --> 55:16.943
I still owe you a good beating.

55:58.319 --> 55:59.353
You all came.

56:23.076 --> 56:25.779
This is it.

56:33.821 --> 56:36.790
Uh, where's your restroom?

56:36.824 --> 56:40.461
It's in the hallway,
to the right.

56:40.494 --> 56:41.729
Thanks for inviting us.

56:41.762 --> 56:43.163
We're happy to have you.

56:43.197 --> 56:45.064
Oh, is that,

56:45.098 --> 56:46.667
- is that soup?
- That's soup.

56:46.700 --> 56:48.802
- Right.
- That's pineapple soup.

56:48.836 --> 56:51.138
- Pineapple soup?
- Pineapple soup.

56:51.171 --> 56:54.642
With okra and fish sauce.

56:54.675 --> 56:55.776
The okra I know.

57:35.683 --> 57:38.686
That's my mom.

57:38.719 --> 57:40.688
- There?
- Mm-hmm.

57:40.721 --> 57:42.656
Who's this?

57:42.690 --> 57:45.159
My older brother.

57:50.531 --> 57:54.735
Lilies were my mom's
favorite flowers.

57:54.768 --> 57:56.870
When we escaped from Vietnam,

57:56.904 --> 58:00.608
our dad decided to split us up
on two boats.

58:00.641 --> 58:03.510
They didn't make it.

58:05.412 --> 58:08.382
We came to the U.S. as refugees.

58:13.387 --> 58:16.457
Why'd your dad split y'all up?

58:19.460 --> 58:23.163
Better chance that
half of us live.

58:33.507 --> 58:35.342
I like your hair.

58:40.481 --> 58:43.651
You ever eat this stuff before?

58:43.684 --> 58:45.419
Mm-mm.

59:56.690 --> 59:58.225
Mmm.

01:00:03.330 --> 01:00:05.499
It's really good.

01:00:05.532 --> 01:00:07.634
It's really good.

01:00:21.548 --> 01:00:24.418
My dad says you have
a kind face.

01:00:27.888 --> 01:00:29.957
Good, good.

01:00:29.990 --> 01:00:32.559
Good.

01:00:33.527 --> 01:00:36.396
Good. Good.

01:01:08.562 --> 01:01:11.698
Being here make me feel
like I'm somewhere else.

01:01:13.500 --> 01:01:16.804
Like I'm in Asia or something.

01:01:23.844 --> 01:01:25.679
Kathy used to always ask me

01:01:25.712 --> 01:01:30.484
if I remember my time
before I came to the U.S.

01:01:31.152 --> 01:01:33.554
I told her no.

01:01:36.157 --> 01:01:39.426
But that was a lie.

01:01:39.459 --> 01:01:42.462
I remember my mom.

01:01:45.499 --> 01:01:47.868
You remind me of her.

01:02:17.497 --> 01:02:18.999
What?

01:02:19.032 --> 01:02:21.068
Come up and sing a song.

01:02:24.671 --> 01:02:27.175
What do you guys know?

01:02:27.208 --> 01:02:28.775

understand what you're saying,

- but I'm trying to help you.
- Uh-huh.

01:05:06.367 --> 01:05:08.902
Just... you have to hold
on to this, okay,

01:05:08.935 --> 01:05:11.004
in order for me
to help you walk.

01:05:12.806 --> 01:05:14.083
I'm trying to help you.
I'm trying to help you.

01:05:14.107 --> 01:05:15.909
Uh-huh.

01:05:35.762 --> 01:05:38.865
Antonio, I know that you, um,

01:05:38.899 --> 01:05:41.235
you said that your adoptive
parents were not around,

01:05:41.269 --> 01:05:43.804
but I did some digging
into your records

01:05:43.837 --> 01:05:47.107
and found out that your
foster mother is still alive.

01:05:49.009 --> 01:05:53.880
You need to tell susanne
to come to the hearing.

01:06:04.658 --> 01:06:06.035
I told her the hearing
was next week,

01:06:06.059 --> 01:06:08.829
but I couldn't get her to agree
over the phone.

01:06:08.862 --> 01:06:12.933
She said she wants you to come
in person and talk to her.

01:06:15.369 --> 01:06:17.704
Yeah, of course. We'll go today.

01:06:17.737 --> 01:06:20.707
Good.
She's about two hours away.

01:06:20.740 --> 01:06:23.944
- In St. francisville.
- I can't do that.

01:06:25.946 --> 01:06:29.683
Look, it's all I could do
to convince the judge

01:06:29.716 --> 01:06:31.952
to get you another hearing.

01:06:31.985 --> 01:06:34.198
- This is your last chance.
- No, she don't need to be there.

01:06:34.222 --> 01:06:36.266
What are you talking about?
We need everyone we can get.

01:06:36.290 --> 01:06:38.859
We need her to come, Antonio.

01:06:38.892 --> 01:06:40.127
You're running out of choices.

01:06:40.161 --> 01:06:41.295
Well, what about merk, hmm?

01:06:41.329 --> 01:06:42.406
I got a friend, he work for ice.

01:06:42.430 --> 01:06:43.797
What about, what about merk?

01:06:43.830 --> 01:06:45.699
- That's not enough.
- He's enough!

01:06:45.732 --> 01:06:47.135
He's not, he's-he's not enough.

01:06:47.168 --> 01:06:49.078
We need to send the strongest
messaging to the judge...

01:06:49.102 --> 01:06:50.980
- Fuck messaging. No, fuck that!
- Do you want to keep

01:06:51.004 --> 01:06:52.349
- our family together or not?
- No, I don't want her there!

01:06:52.373 --> 01:06:53.973
- We need this.
- I don't want her there!

01:07:00.381 --> 01:07:02.350
The people that you have coming

01:07:02.383 --> 01:07:04.084
are your friends.

01:07:04.117 --> 01:07:06.154
Susanne is your parent.

01:07:06.187 --> 01:07:07.754
She ain't my fucking parent.

01:07:07.787 --> 01:07:09.832
Yeah, that's right, because
you told me she was dead.

01:07:09.856 --> 01:07:12.160
Okay, come on, guys, look, look.

01:07:12.193 --> 01:07:14.228
I know this is hard.

01:07:14.262 --> 01:07:17.298
I've done a lot of these cases,
and it brings up the past.

01:07:17.331 --> 01:07:19.966
It's painful.

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:22.903
You need to tell her to come
to the hearing.

01:07:25.439 --> 01:07:28.942
No, fuck that. I won't do it.

01:07:33.514 --> 01:07:35.815
How come you didn't tell me?

01:07:37.418 --> 01:07:38.952
Hey!

01:07:38.985 --> 01:07:42.722
Antonio, I'm talking to you!

01:07:42.756 --> 01:07:45.025
Were you ever gonna tell me?!

01:07:49.163 --> 01:07:50.464
You have to talk to her.

01:07:50.498 --> 01:07:51.778
If you want to stay,
you have to.

01:08:07.847 --> 01:08:09.383
Hey! Wait a minute.

01:08:09.417 --> 01:08:11.361
- You got my money?
- I don't got the money, Ms. Jacci.

01:08:11.385 --> 01:08:12.786
You better have my money.

01:08:12.819 --> 01:08:13.996
I don't got the money,
Ms. Jacci! Okay?

01:08:14.020 --> 01:08:15.499
Let me get you straight.
No money, no job.

01:08:15.523 --> 01:08:17.325
I don't got the money.
No job? Okay.

01:08:17.358 --> 01:08:19.502
- Pick up this shit and get out.
- Okay, I'll pack my shit

01:08:19.527 --> 01:08:21.162
and I'll leave.

01:08:53.960 --> 01:08:56.095
What you doing here?

01:09:00.066 --> 01:09:03.136
I came here for another tattoo.

01:09:06.038 --> 01:09:08.175
What you think this is, huh?

01:09:08.209 --> 01:09:10.910
Free therapy?

01:09:10.944 --> 01:09:14.848
You think getting a tattoo
gonna save your life?

01:09:20.520 --> 01:09:22.055
Leave.

01:09:35.636 --> 01:09:37.904
Hey, Jessie.

01:09:37.937 --> 01:09:39.573
Hey, Jessie. Hey.

01:09:39.607 --> 01:09:41.309
Hey, d... hey. Hey.

01:09:41.341 --> 01:09:42.917
Hey, where you... hey, hey,
where you going?

01:09:42.942 --> 01:09:44.911
Where you going?
I ain't gonna hurt you.

01:09:44.944 --> 01:09:48.448
I ain't gonna hurt you.
I'm your daddy, okay?

01:09:48.482 --> 01:09:50.884
How you doing? How was school?

01:09:57.358 --> 01:09:59.193
Listen, I need, I need
to tell you something.

01:09:59.226 --> 01:10:02.196
Okay? I need you to listen,
really hear me. Okay?

01:10:03.664 --> 01:10:07.100
I know I messed up.

01:10:07.134 --> 01:10:12.473
And I-I know I-I shouldn't
have left y'all.

01:10:12.506 --> 01:10:14.908
And I'm really sorry.

01:10:18.078 --> 01:10:19.879
Okay?

01:10:19.913 --> 01:10:21.515
But I'm gonna make up for it.

01:10:21.549 --> 01:10:23.950
Okay? I promise.

01:10:32.660 --> 01:10:35.028
Jessie.

01:10:35.995 --> 01:10:38.165
Come here. Hey.

01:10:38.199 --> 01:10:39.433
You okay?

01:10:39.467 --> 01:10:42.636
You know, at some point, we're
gonna have to figure this out.

01:10:42.670 --> 01:10:45.105
You can't keep her
from me forever.

01:10:48.309 --> 01:10:52.246
If Antonio gets deported,
I'm filing for custody.

01:10:52.279 --> 01:10:53.919
And there's no way no judge
is gonna think

01:10:53.947 --> 01:10:55.516
you taking her is a good idea.

01:10:55.549 --> 01:10:57.917
And what if I do, huh?

01:10:57.951 --> 01:11:00.187
What if I do take her?

01:11:01.555 --> 01:11:04.392
You know he's been stealing
motorcycles again, right?

01:11:08.262 --> 01:11:10.029
Let's go.

01:12:05.586 --> 01:12:07.086
Hey.

01:12:11.492 --> 01:12:12.660
Hi, Jessie.

01:12:12.693 --> 01:12:14.495
Hi, dad.

01:12:21.802 --> 01:12:24.205
I got you some flowers.

01:12:36.250 --> 01:12:38.752
Y'all ain't gonna talk to me?

01:12:38.786 --> 01:12:41.020
Kathy?

01:12:41.054 --> 01:12:42.121
Who is that?

01:12:42.156 --> 01:12:44.492
It's my mom.

01:12:44.525 --> 01:12:47.495
- What is she doing here?
- What do you mean?

01:12:47.528 --> 01:12:49.530
Kathy.

01:12:50.464 --> 01:12:53.400
I'm gonna get
a few things together.

01:12:56.136 --> 01:12:57.481
- Okay.
- What's she talking about?

01:12:57.505 --> 01:13:00.106
- We're done.
- Hey, what's she talking about?

01:13:00.140 --> 01:13:02.376
Come here.

01:13:19.293 --> 01:13:20.594
Yeah.

01:13:22.830 --> 01:13:25.833
Is there anything
you want to tell me?

01:13:29.703 --> 01:13:31.205
What you mean?

01:13:35.175 --> 01:13:37.311
Okay.

01:13:40.147 --> 01:13:43.284
It's okay. It's okay.

01:13:43.317 --> 01:13:46.587
You, you can talk to me.

01:13:46.620 --> 01:13:48.087
- Yeah, I know...
- Yeah.

01:13:48.121 --> 01:13:50.190
- Yeah, I know that.
- I love you.

01:13:50.224 --> 01:13:52.326
- I love you, too.
- Yeah.

01:14:00.301 --> 01:14:03.170
Have you been meeting up with q?

01:14:07.341 --> 01:14:10.611
No. No.

01:14:15.182 --> 01:14:17.585
No, Kathy. Hey.

01:14:17.618 --> 01:14:20.387
Hey. What's going on?

01:14:20.421 --> 01:14:23.257
- Hey, Kathy, what's going...
- You're a fucking liar!

01:14:23.290 --> 01:14:26.427
Fucking... fucking lying to me.

01:14:30.297 --> 01:14:32.733
Hey.

01:14:32.766 --> 01:14:34.234
You think I'm fucking stupid?

01:14:34.268 --> 01:14:37.771
I-I knew jacci didn't
give you that money.

01:14:37.805 --> 01:14:39.406
Hey, come on.
Hey, let me talk to you.

01:14:39.440 --> 01:14:41.308
- Don't touch me.
- No. Hey. No. Hey, Kathy,

01:14:41.342 --> 01:14:43.444
let me, let-let me,
let me talk to you for...

01:14:43.477 --> 01:14:46.513
- I'm done! I am done.
- For one second.

01:14:50.584 --> 01:14:52.886
How was I supposed to get
that kind of money, okay?

01:14:52.920 --> 01:14:54.588
What was I supposed to do?

01:14:54.622 --> 01:14:56.232
Yeah, I'm trying to keep
the family together.

01:14:56.256 --> 01:14:57.758
No, you're not.

01:14:57.791 --> 01:15:00.894
We needed a lawyer, so I got
the goddamn money, Kathy.

01:15:00.928 --> 01:15:04.198
You think I care
about the money?!

01:15:04.231 --> 01:15:07.167
I would g... I would go
with you to...

01:15:07.201 --> 01:15:10.838
To anywhere if you had tried.

01:15:10.871 --> 01:15:15.709
But you... you won't even
talk to your mom.

01:15:15.743 --> 01:15:17.778
That's crazy.

01:15:17.811 --> 01:15:19.546
Do you see how crazy that is?

01:15:19.580 --> 01:15:21.649
You won't even talk to her
to stay here,

01:15:21.682 --> 01:15:23.784
but you think stealing
is the right way?

01:15:23.817 --> 01:15:24.894
You don't know what you saying.

01:15:24.918 --> 01:15:26.453
- Yes, I do.
- No, you don't.

01:15:26.487 --> 01:15:27.931
- Yes, I do.
- You don't know what you saying, no.

01:15:27.955 --> 01:15:30.357
It's simple.
You won't even talk to your mom

01:15:30.391 --> 01:15:33.594
and ask her to come so you can
be with your family.

01:15:38.866 --> 01:15:41.502
How come you never told me?

01:15:44.405 --> 01:15:46.607
How are we married
when I don't even know

01:15:46.640 --> 01:15:48.742
that your mom's alive?

01:15:51.845 --> 01:15:54.615
- I don't know you.
- Yeah.

01:15:54.648 --> 01:15:56.517
Yeah, you don't know me.

01:15:56.550 --> 01:15:58.852
Okay?

01:15:58.886 --> 01:16:02.489
You don't know nothing
about that. Okay?

01:16:02.523 --> 01:16:04.558
Okay, you don't,
you don't want to know

01:16:04.591 --> 01:16:05.935
that the people
who brought me here...

01:16:05.959 --> 01:16:07.361
You don't want to know

01:16:07.394 --> 01:16:08.829
that the people
who brought me here

01:16:08.862 --> 01:16:10.497
gave me up
after six months, okay?

01:16:10.531 --> 01:16:12.766
You don't want to know
that I went from foster home

01:16:12.800 --> 01:16:14.468
to foster home and-and when I...

01:16:14.501 --> 01:16:15.845
- You never told me that.
- I know, and when I

01:16:15.869 --> 01:16:18.706
finally thought I ended up
with some parents, okay,

01:16:18.739 --> 01:16:22.776
that man beat the shit
out of me every goddamn day

01:16:22.810 --> 01:16:25.312
and she didn't do shit about it!

01:16:25.345 --> 01:16:27.514
And you want me to go
back there and beg her.

01:16:27.548 --> 01:16:28.849
No, you want me to go back...

01:16:28.882 --> 01:16:30.584
She ain't gonna help me, okay?!

01:16:30.617 --> 01:16:33.754
If she didn't help me before,
she ain't gonna help me now!

01:16:33.787 --> 01:16:36.557
- It's time to go, Kathy.
- Dawn!

01:16:37.725 --> 01:16:40.694
Get the fuck out my house.

01:16:42.362 --> 01:16:43.797
Come on, Kathy.

01:16:43.831 --> 01:16:46.333
You need to leave.

01:17:00.080 --> 01:17:02.816
Well, you never told me.

01:17:24.671 --> 01:17:26.807
Get in the car, baby.

01:17:32.412 --> 01:17:34.748
Coming, daddy?

01:17:34.782 --> 01:17:36.683
Nah, baby girl.

01:17:36.717 --> 01:17:38.418
Go with your mama.

01:17:38.452 --> 01:17:40.487
Jessie, let's go.

01:17:49.763 --> 01:17:51.064
You done fixing that man?

01:17:51.098 --> 01:17:52.866
Just go.

01:19:52.052 --> 01:19:54.021
When did Henry die?

01:19:56.089 --> 01:19:59.826
About ten years ago,
give or take.

01:20:09.536 --> 01:20:12.873
I'm here to ask you, uh,

01:20:12.906 --> 01:20:15.976
if you'll come to
a merits hearing for me.

01:20:18.078 --> 01:20:19.980
They're trying to deport me.

01:20:24.218 --> 01:20:26.853
Will you come?

01:20:29.890 --> 01:20:31.725
Susanne?

01:20:33.093 --> 01:20:35.095
You just have to show up

01:20:35.128 --> 01:20:37.731
and talk to the judge,
that's it.

01:20:42.803 --> 01:20:44.771
Susanne.

01:20:46.006 --> 01:20:50.010
I am just asking you
for this one thing.

01:20:54.614 --> 01:20:56.616
Will you come?

01:21:06.660 --> 01:21:10.030
Why'd you have me come
all the way over here?

01:21:15.102 --> 01:21:17.037
I don't know.

01:21:25.279 --> 01:21:27.047
Okay.

01:21:33.053 --> 01:21:34.955
You want to know why I left?

01:21:39.793 --> 01:21:43.730
'Cause when we
used to get beat up together,

01:21:43.764 --> 01:21:46.867
I always tried to protect you.

01:21:51.339 --> 01:21:55.008
And that day I asked you
to leave with me,

01:21:55.042 --> 01:21:56.943
you stayed.

01:22:03.317 --> 01:22:05.186
You never chose me.

01:22:05.219 --> 01:22:07.854
Susanne, you never chose me.

01:22:12.959 --> 01:22:14.795
That's all I wanted.

01:22:49.397 --> 01:22:50.997
You okay?

01:22:51.031 --> 01:22:52.400
Your body holding up?

01:22:52.433 --> 01:22:53.934
Uh-huh.

01:23:04.811 --> 01:23:08.282
Your dad don't mind
I'm doing this?

01:23:08.316 --> 01:23:10.717
He's just happy that I'm happy.

01:23:15.021 --> 01:23:18.024
You think he'd mind
if I ask him something?

01:23:19.327 --> 01:23:22.662
He doesn't mind.

01:23:22.696 --> 01:23:24.298
Can you ask him if he regrets

01:23:24.332 --> 01:23:26.134
splitting y'all up on two boats?

01:23:37.245 --> 01:23:38.979
Never.

01:24:02.236 --> 01:24:06.039
Do you know why I like
the Fleur-de-lis, Antonio?

01:24:07.807 --> 01:24:11.077
Because water lilies look
like they have no roots.

01:24:11.111 --> 01:24:12.979
But they do.

01:24:13.013 --> 01:24:16.883
They can't survive without them.

01:24:21.155 --> 01:24:22.689
Hmm.

01:24:28.028 --> 01:24:30.431
When I was 12...

01:24:30.464 --> 01:24:33.099
Henry, my dad...

01:24:34.100 --> 01:24:37.837
He told me I got a letter
from my real mama.

01:24:37.871 --> 01:24:39.407
At first, I didn't believe him

01:24:39.440 --> 01:24:43.277
because why would she send me
a letter after all that time?

01:24:47.248 --> 01:24:49.983
He kept talking about it.

01:24:50.016 --> 01:24:51.885
Every day.

01:24:54.988 --> 01:24:58.024
He asked me if I wanted
to see it; I told him no.

01:24:59.527 --> 01:25:02.062
But when I finally asked
if I could...

01:25:06.133 --> 01:25:08.169
He told me he threw it away.

01:25:10.304 --> 01:25:12.240
Like it was nothing.

01:25:17.877 --> 01:25:19.746
But then I found it.

01:25:22.283 --> 01:25:24.884
What did it say?

01:25:24.918 --> 01:25:27.053
It was written
in broken English,

01:25:27.087 --> 01:25:29.323
so it was hard to read, but...

01:25:30.424 --> 01:25:33.026
It said she tried
to drown me.

01:25:35.829 --> 01:25:37.897
She held me under that water.

01:25:42.035 --> 01:25:45.172
I guess she couldn't go through
with it, so she gave me up.

01:25:47.007 --> 01:25:50.076
She kept me as long
as she could.

01:26:13.601 --> 01:26:15.603
It's okay.

01:26:15.636 --> 01:26:17.937
You have to put it on.

01:26:17.971 --> 01:26:19.939
Just for a little bit.

01:26:21.609 --> 01:26:23.377
Okay.

01:26:47.934 --> 01:26:50.870
Faster.

01:28:18.659 --> 01:28:20.494
This is your daughter.

01:29:07.741 --> 01:29:09.510
Hey, Jessie.

01:29:11.412 --> 01:29:13.347
Come here, it's okay.

01:29:14.482 --> 01:29:16.150
Come here.

01:29:35.436 --> 01:29:37.671
I talked to susanne.

01:29:37.705 --> 01:29:39.773
My mom.

01:29:39.807 --> 01:29:42.409
You did?

01:29:45.679 --> 01:29:48.349
She ain't coming.

01:31:34.822 --> 01:31:35.923
That's it?

01:31:35.956 --> 01:31:38.392
You three?

01:31:42.830 --> 01:31:44.698
Where's Antonio?

01:31:51.839 --> 01:31:54.375
What are you doing here?

01:31:54.408 --> 01:31:57.678
If Antonio stays, Jessie stays.

01:32:07.421 --> 01:32:08.422
Thank you.

01:32:37.818 --> 01:32:39.620
All rise.

01:32:39.653 --> 01:32:40.854
Court is now in session.

01:32:40.888 --> 01:32:43.590
The honorable judge Adams
presides.

01:32:49.329 --> 01:32:50.431
<i>You didn't think</i>

01:32:50.464 --> 01:32:52.232
I was gonna pay you back,
did you?!

01:33:35.743 --> 01:33:37.277
Don't you dare.

01:33:39.913 --> 01:33:41.749
Come on.

01:33:41.782 --> 01:33:43.784
Let's go to your room.

01:34:08.609 --> 01:34:10.644
I got to go.

01:34:10.677 --> 01:34:11.945
Got to go.

01:37:46.960 --> 01:37:48.061
Hey.

01:37:48.095 --> 01:37:50.497
You drive.

01:37:51.765 --> 01:37:53.900
<i>I'm gonna take
all that leftover shit...</i>

01:37:53.934 --> 01:37:54.901
<i>Fat, lard,</i>

01:37:54.935 --> 01:37:56.204
dick, ears...

01:37:56.237 --> 01:37:57.838
From all different animals,

01:37:57.871 --> 01:38:00.607
and I'm gonna stuff it
in goddamn intestines.

01:38:00.640 --> 01:38:02.009
That's how they make sausage?

01:38:02.042 --> 01:38:04.611
Huh? I can't believe
I've been eating that shit.

01:38:04.644 --> 01:38:06.780
Now, when I eat it,
all I can think about is...

01:38:06.813 --> 01:38:09.649
Denny, can you shut
the fuck up?!

01:38:09.683 --> 01:38:13.820
For just one goddamn minute
in your fucking life!

01:38:14.621 --> 01:38:15.555
All right. Jesus.

01:38:15.589 --> 01:38:17.090
I was just sharing.

01:38:18.658 --> 01:38:21.561
You're welcome, by the way.

01:38:21.595 --> 01:38:22.562
What you mean?

01:38:22.596 --> 01:38:24.831
I took care of him.

01:38:24.865 --> 01:38:26.600
Took care of... what you mean?

01:38:26.633 --> 01:38:27.777
- What you talking about?
- I told you.

01:38:27.801 --> 01:38:29.603
I told you I'd take care of him.

01:38:29.636 --> 01:38:32.005
Me and a few friends,
we found him at a diner.

01:38:32.039 --> 01:38:34.308
So we picked him up,
took him out to the woods,

01:38:34.342 --> 01:38:35.876
beat the shit out of him.

01:38:35.909 --> 01:38:38.045
I thought we killed him.
You should've seen him.

01:38:38.078 --> 01:38:39.679
He kept going, like, uh...

01:38:39.713 --> 01:38:41.648
"No, no, please stop it.

01:38:41.681 --> 01:38:42.883
"I have to go to court.

01:38:42.916 --> 01:38:44.818
Please, please.
Let me go to court."

01:38:44.851 --> 01:38:47.754
I'm like, "nah,
you ain't going to court."

01:38:47.788 --> 01:38:50.123
Actually, it's kind of funny
when you think about it,

01:38:50.158 --> 01:38:51.792
because...

01:38:51.825 --> 01:38:53.660
We're always trying
to put 'em in court, huh?

01:38:55.028 --> 01:38:56.063
Hmm.

01:39:01.302 --> 01:39:03.970
- Oh, Denny.
- What?

01:39:05.206 --> 01:39:07.208
I'd like to shake your hand.

01:39:07.241 --> 01:39:09.343
- All right.
- Yeah.

01:39:09.377 --> 01:39:10.311
Huh.

01:39:10.344 --> 01:39:11.645
There we go.

01:39:11.678 --> 01:39:13.347
What are you...? Hey. Come on.

01:39:13.381 --> 01:39:14.781
What is this?

01:39:14.815 --> 01:39:16.616
Ace, come on.
Stop being silly, now.

01:39:16.650 --> 01:39:17.994
- We got to go to work.
- Look at me.

01:39:18.018 --> 01:39:18.685
What?

01:39:18.718 --> 01:39:20.887
You're going to fucking jail.

01:39:20.921 --> 01:39:22.223
What?

01:39:22.256 --> 01:39:24.825
What? Hey. Hey.

01:39:24.858 --> 01:39:26.927
Hey, you better think
about what you're doing!

01:39:26.960 --> 01:39:28.695
We're supposed
to stick together!

01:39:28.728 --> 01:39:30.364
You just fucked up, ace!

01:39:30.398 --> 01:39:32.833
Fucking sh...
Oh, this motherfucker.

01:39:32.866 --> 01:39:36.103
He better be bluffing,
his ungrateful ass.

01:39:46.113 --> 01:39:47.948
What the fuck?!

01:39:47.981 --> 01:39:49.683
You know what the hell
you did to us?!

01:39:49.716 --> 01:39:51.718
- What? No. What'd I do?
- Huh?!

01:39:51.751 --> 01:39:54.121
- Say something, you piece of shit!
- Fuck!

01:39:54.155 --> 01:39:55.389
Fuck!

01:39:55.423 --> 01:39:58.992
Stupid fucking ass!

01:40:00.694 --> 01:40:03.663
You don't know
what you did to us!

01:40:14.908 --> 01:40:17.211
Hey, Kathy, it's okay.

01:40:17.245 --> 01:40:18.446
It's okay.

01:40:18.479 --> 01:40:21.681
It's okay. It's okay.

01:40:21.715 --> 01:40:24.152
Fuck.

01:40:27.854 --> 01:40:29.122
<i>My brother.</i>

01:40:29.956 --> 01:40:31.892
Take care of yourself, man.

01:40:31.925 --> 01:40:33.026
I will.

01:41:12.366 --> 01:41:13.934
<i>Last time I saw my mom,</i>

01:41:13.967 --> 01:41:17.138
<i>she didn't want to let me go.</i>

01:41:17.171 --> 01:41:19.340
<i>She held me tight.</i>

01:41:19.373 --> 01:41:22.176
<i>That's what I remember.</i>

01:41:23.444 --> 01:41:25.313
<i>We always want the best thing</i>

01:41:25.346 --> 01:41:28.048
<i>for our families, Antonio.</i>

01:41:29.849 --> 01:41:33.720
It just don't always turn out
the way we thought.

01:42:25.273 --> 01:42:26.973
Good morning, bro.

01:42:27.007 --> 01:42:28.942
Look, man, I know you're busy,
but I need to know

01:42:28.975 --> 01:42:31.545
if an Antonio leblanc
checked in today.

01:42:31.579 --> 01:42:33.281
Hold on.

01:42:35.316 --> 01:42:37.050
Yeah, he's here.

01:42:37.083 --> 01:42:39.153
Can you tell me
who's escorting him?

01:42:49.062 --> 01:42:51.898
It look different
in the morning.

01:42:53.501 --> 01:42:56.237
I see why you like it out here.

01:42:56.270 --> 01:42:58.306
It's beautiful.

01:43:05.513 --> 01:43:07.914
If you run...

01:43:11.485 --> 01:43:13.920
I won't catch you.

01:44:01.635 --> 01:44:04.405
- Love you, brother.
- Okay.

01:44:47.348 --> 01:44:49.283
Miss, you're gonna follow me.
Ma'am. Ma'am.

01:44:49.316 --> 01:44:51.716
- Ma'am, you have to follow me, okay?
- No. You can't. Can't.

01:45:07.033 --> 01:45:08.436
- They gone, ace.

01:45:08.469 --> 01:45:11.172

01:45:11.205 --> 01:45:12.616
- Yeah. Yeah, they're all...
- Where'd they go?

01:45:12.640 --> 01:45:14.049
- They all gone to the airport.
- Shit.

01:45:14.073 --> 01:45:15.509
- You might catch them.
- Shit.

01:45:17.478 --> 01:45:20.448
Come on, Jessie. Come here.

01:45:21.415 --> 01:45:24.117
Hurry up.

What are you doing here?

01:45:44.405 --> 01:45:46.440
We're going with you.

01:45:56.417 --> 01:45:59.018
Sir, you can't leave
your car there.

01:45:59.052 --> 01:46:01.388

01:46:03.157 --> 01:46:05.091
Okay. Come on. Come on, come on.

Oh, excuse you.

01:46:46.667 --> 01:46:48.602
Stop! Jessie!

01:46:49.336 --> 01:46:51.405
- Oh, my god.

01:46:51.438 --> 01:46:52.606
Hey, buddy.

01:46:52.640 --> 01:46:54.608
Excuse me. Jessie!

01:47:09.857 --> 01:47:12.660
I just want to say goodbye
to my daughter.

01:47:16.564 --> 01:47:19.567
Okay. Okay.

01:47:20.601 --> 01:47:22.570
Say goodbye to ace.

01:47:23.571 --> 01:47:25.205
Hey.

01:47:28.475 --> 01:47:31.679
I don't know when
I'm gonna see you again.

01:47:33.914 --> 01:47:36.317
Can I have a hug?

01:47:37.685 --> 01:47:40.086
Yeah?

01:47:43.357 --> 01:47:46.092
I'll see you, baby, okay?

01:47:59.306 --> 01:48:02.108
I'm sorry, baby.

01:48:03.444 --> 01:48:05.512
I'm sorry.

I'll go first.

01:48:43.751 --> 01:48:45.929
I'll get everything set up,
and y'all meet me there later.

01:48:45.953 --> 01:48:47.888
Don't-don't do this.
