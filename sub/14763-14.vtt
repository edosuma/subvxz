Friday, what's next

00:36.037 --> 00:39.004
Whoa. Sorry, Black Widow.
Didn't mean to sneak up.

00:39.006 --> 00:41.240
Just seeing if you wanted
a night off.

00:41.242 --> 00:43.175
Downtime? Tried it.

00:43.177 --> 00:45.611
Hated it. Sorry, Hulk.

00:46.913 --> 00:49.114
I'll stick to my calendar,
thank you.

00:50.683 --> 00:51.917
FRIDAY: <i> Stingers calibrated.</i>

00:51.919 --> 00:53.986
Anyway, this is fun.

00:55.221 --> 00:56.855
Yeah, okay.

00:56.857 --> 00:59.525
Maybe a little downtime
would be all right.

00:59.527 --> 01:01.226
Let's hit the town.

01:01.228 --> 01:02.928

Not literally.
Aw.

01:13.873 --> 01:16.909
You should've
brought a jacket.
Kidding?

01:16.911 --> 01:20.012
This is the only time of year
the city reminds me of home.

01:20.014 --> 01:22.381
Huh. What was
that childhood like?

01:22.383 --> 01:25.250
I can't remember
much before...

01:25.252 --> 01:26.718
The Red Room?

01:26.720 --> 01:28.554
Before you became
Black Widow?

01:28.556 --> 01:31.623
Don't really want
to talk about it.

01:31.625 --> 01:34.026
Should've seen Banner
in high school.

01:34.028 --> 01:35.194
Nerd?

01:35.196 --> 01:37.129
Wish I'd gone
to the reunion.

01:37.131 --> 01:39.531
Wouldn't laugh

That was fun.

02:07.128 --> 02:08.994
And I needed it.

02:12.165 --> 02:14.233

We should take care of that

(STOMACH GROWLING)

02:18.772 --> 02:21.240

How many you want?

One.
One?

02:23.010 --> 02:24.910
Yeah. One cart.

Hmm.

02:33.419 --> 02:35.020
Huh? (SCREAMS)

Hulk!

Iron Man, Captain America.

03:21.368 --> 03:22.834
<i>Hydra's got Hulk!</i>

03:22.836 --> 03:24.369
Got it. Locking down
your coordinates.

03:24.371 --> 03:26.071
Be there in five.
<i>Don't have five minutes.</i>

03:26.073 --> 03:27.406
Going radio silent.

03:28.308 --> 03:29.374
Ping me.

Huh?

(SIGHS)

03:59.439 --> 04:03.075
YELENA: Baron Strucker.
The final piece to your plan.

04:03.077 --> 04:04.743
Excellent, young one.

04:04.745 --> 04:06.945
You are proving your worth.

04:06.947 --> 04:09.014
Slowly, of course.

04:09.016 --> 04:10.849
This was nothing.

04:10.851 --> 04:13.118
I'm capable of so much more.

04:13.120 --> 04:15.387
If you would just...
Finally,

04:15.389 --> 04:16.588
I have the Hulk.

04:16.589 --> 04:18.257
With him under my control,

04:18.259 --> 04:20.358
no one will be able
to stop me.

04:20.361 --> 04:21.793
Except me.

04:21.795 --> 04:24.363
Your attitude has
outgrown your skill.

04:24.365 --> 04:27.199
You don't even know the value
of what you brought me.

04:27.201 --> 04:29.568
With Arnim Zola's
lost program,

04:29.570 --> 04:31.970
which I've upgraded
significantly,

04:31.972 --> 04:34.106
controlling the power
of the Hulk,

04:34.108 --> 04:36.708
I have the strongest
weapon in the world.

04:36.710 --> 04:40.646
Yes. Of course, Baron.
(GROANS)

04:40.648 --> 04:42.848
Prep the body
for conversion.

04:44.050 --> 04:45.617
Oh, my dear girl.

04:45.619 --> 04:47.419
Prove yourself worthy,

04:47.421 --> 04:49.655
and I will treat you thusly.

05:07.740 --> 05:10.809
Care to take a look
at the future of Hydra?

05:10.811 --> 05:13.979
All my work is about
to come to fruition.

05:13.981 --> 05:17.482
And all that's left
to do is watch.

05:17.484 --> 05:19.751
You've been doing
nothing but watching

05:19.753 --> 05:21.253
for some time.

05:21.255 --> 05:22.921
If you wish
to throw a tantrum,

05:22.923 --> 05:26.258
I can replace you
with someone quieter.

05:26.260 --> 05:28.627
You think that is
your greatest creation.

05:28.629 --> 05:31.363
I alone took down
your unstoppable Hulk.

All I needed to hear.

05:35.001 --> 05:37.336
(GRUNTING)

05:37.338 --> 05:39.338
You brought back
a stray with you.

05:39.340 --> 05:42.474

this one simple thing right.

05:42.476 --> 05:43.975
(GROWLS)

05:43.977 --> 05:46.311
You're so desperate
to prove yourself.

05:46.313 --> 05:50.082
Fine. The opportunity
has come to you.

05:53.953 --> 05:55.821
What are you up to?

05:55.823 --> 05:58.223
(CHUCKLES)
Black Widow,

05:58.225 --> 06:00.625
you don't notice
a sister in arms?

06:00.627 --> 06:04.563
Your step, hers.
Your attack, her counter.

06:04.565 --> 06:08.500
Until I captured the Hulk,
she was my greatest asset.

06:08.502 --> 06:11.236
What is this, Strucker?
Who is she?

06:11.238 --> 06:12.904
Natasha Romanoff,

06:12.906 --> 06:15.006
allow me to introduce

06:15.008 --> 06:16.708
Yelena Belova,

06:16.710 --> 06:18.410
the new Black Widow.

06:18.412 --> 06:22.080
But I destroyed
the Red Room program.

06:22.082 --> 06:24.383
And I brought it back.

06:52.780 --> 06:55.380
Version 2.0,

06:57.384 --> 07:01.520
brawn, stealth
and power that only...

07:07.126 --> 07:08.593
BLACK WIDOW:
So that's your plan?

07:08.595 --> 07:10.929
Turn Hulk into
something like me?

07:10.931 --> 07:12.397
Into a Widow?

07:12.399 --> 07:13.932
Not quite.

07:13.934 --> 07:16.735
The raw destructive force
of the Hulk

07:16.737 --> 07:20.138
transformed into a ruthless
Hydra soldier.

07:20.140 --> 07:21.606
Turn it off.

07:21.608 --> 07:26.278
(LAUGHS)
There is no turning it off.
Not now.

07:26.280 --> 07:30.315
Hulk will be my most
powerful recruit yet.
(STRUGGLING)

07:31.584 --> 07:34.252

I wasn't really planning
on a trip to Siberia.

08:07.321 --> 08:09.120
You know, they have
perfectly good frozen tundra

08:09.122 --> 08:10.422
in North America.

08:10.424 --> 08:13.091
You're too late.
(GRUNTS)

08:13.093 --> 08:14.960
Stand down, Strucker.

08:14.962 --> 08:16.695
Surrender to them,

08:16.697 --> 08:18.497
I know when
you're outmatched.

08:18.499 --> 08:19.931
But I have her.

08:19.933 --> 08:22.334
You have nothing.

08:22.336 --> 08:24.002
You may be well trained,

But you don't stand a chance
going against another Widow.

11:11.772 --> 11:13.838
You turned
on your own kind.

11:13.840 --> 11:17.008
You don't deserve
to be a Widow.

11:17.010 --> 11:19.878
Destroy the Deep Forest
Hydra Facility.

11:19.880 --> 11:21.846
Spare no one.

11:21.848 --> 11:22.714
No, Hulk!

11:27.119 --> 11:29.487
Why would you destroy
your own facility?

11:29.489 --> 11:32.057
A Widow destroys
from within.

11:32.059 --> 11:34.693
With the Winter Hulk
as my personal weapon,

11:34.695 --> 11:36.961
now I am the new

(BOTH GRUNTING)

11:42.401 --> 11:44.736
Welcome back.
Sorry, it took a minute.

You know Hydra.
You take one down,
two more come back.

11:48.141 --> 11:49.374
Where's the big guy?

IRON MAN: Yeah, okay.

Hulk is in there.

12:03.423 --> 12:05.890
You won't be able

12:05.892 --> 12:07.592
You'll never know.

12:07.594 --> 12:11.329

Sure thing. (GRUNTS)

12:36.255 --> 12:37.889
No.

12:37.891 --> 12:40.058
What would your family
think of you now?

12:40.060 --> 12:41.926
You don't know
anything about them.

12:41.928 --> 12:44.095
I know that you're in
way over your head.

12:44.097 --> 12:46.865
What did they call you,
by the way? Lenochka?

12:46.867 --> 12:48.767
Don't use that name.

12:48.769 --> 12:50.769
What did Strucker
tell you?

12:50.771 --> 12:52.303
That you had to
give up everything,

12:52.305 --> 12:54.405
even your childhood nickname?

12:54.407 --> 12:56.941
It was worth it
to be the new Widow.

12:56.943 --> 12:58.910
The only Widow.

12:58.912 --> 13:00.945
(BOTH GRUNTING)

13:00.947 --> 13:03.148
You don't have to be
what the program made you.

13:03.150 --> 13:04.649
(LAUGHS)

13:04.651 --> 13:06.818
What choice
do I have now?

13:10.890 --> 13:12.490
And despite
what you think,

13:12.492 --> 13:14.726
you don't have
a choice either.

13:16.996 --> 13:18.062
(BEEPS)

13:27.940 --> 13:30.141
No.

13:30.143 --> 13:32.477
IRON MAN: I'm not detecting
any heat signatures.

13:32.479 --> 13:35.280
It's like Hulk
disappeared
into thin air.

13:35.282 --> 13:38.583
I'd say he jumped from here,
but the impressions
aren't deep enough.

13:38.585 --> 13:39.984
I don't like this.

13:39.986 --> 13:41.820
I know
the Winter Soldier program

13:41.822 --> 13:44.589
and how dangerous
it can turn any individual.

13:44.591 --> 13:47.592
Can't imagine that
focus and stealth
with someone like Hulk.

13:47.594 --> 13:50.028
The day Hulk
sneaks up on us

13:50.030 --> 13:52.163
is the day
I turn in this armor.

13:52.865 --> 13:54.499
Look out.

13:55.601 --> 13:56.835
(BOTH GRUNT)

13:58.337 --> 14:00.905
Not sure you want
to give up that armor now.

14:15.221 --> 14:16.855
(GRUNTS)

14:19.959 --> 14:21.960
Long-range attacks.
Don't get in close.

14:26.398 --> 14:28.867
(GRUNTING)

14:28.869 --> 14:31.069
IRON MAN: He's already got
that long-range thing down.

14:31.071 --> 14:33.638
Don't worry.
Backup is coming.

14:34.673 --> 14:36.374
All right, big guy.

14:36.376 --> 14:37.775
Let's dance.
(GRUNTING)

14:41.413 --> 14:42.914
(BONES CRACKING)
(GROANING)

14:46.018 --> 14:46.985
Let Cap go.

14:48.721 --> 14:51.022
My Hulkbuster's ready
to dish it out.

14:51.024 --> 14:52.357
Come get some.

14:52.359 --> 14:53.925
(GRUNTS)

14:56.595 --> 14:58.162
What have you done?

15:04.937 --> 15:09.040
YELENA: Ever wonder
what became of the washouts
from the Red Room?

15:09.042 --> 15:11.042
Strucker's technology.

15:11.044 --> 15:14.012
My Winter Soldier army.

15:14.014 --> 15:16.281
Destroy Natasha Romanoff,

15:16.283 --> 15:18.850
the old Black Widow.

15:22.521 --> 15:25.924
I must admit, Romanoff,
you have a great gift.

15:25.926 --> 15:27.959
Smart. Fearless.

15:27.961 --> 15:29.394
Powerful, even.

15:29.396 --> 15:31.596
And yet,
you squander it all

15:31.598 --> 15:34.632
by working
for spoiled children.

15:34.634 --> 15:37.735
And the zombie Widow Soldiers
you created of your classmates

15:37.737 --> 15:39.804
is a marked improvement?

15:39.806 --> 15:41.272
(GRUNTING)

15:49.548 --> 15:52.317
This is why you
calibrate your stingers.

15:58.824 --> 16:01.159
And bring extra ammo.

16:01.161 --> 16:02.660
(GRUNTING)

16:05.331 --> 16:09.634
(CHUCKLES)
I will never make the mistake
of following as you have.

16:09.636 --> 16:13.071
A Widow leads.
You're right.

16:14.173 --> 16:15.306
(GRUNTING)

16:18.010 --> 16:19.310
(BEEPS)
(GASPS)

16:20.412 --> 16:22.180
Time for bed.

16:23.816 --> 16:25.817
Enough distractions.

16:25.819 --> 16:27.952
You want to see
if you're better
than me?

16:27.954 --> 16:29.420
Let's find out.

16:48.941 --> 16:50.108
What does he need
a knife for?

16:51.377 --> 16:54.178
(GRUNTS)
Oh, that.

17:00.052 --> 17:03.054
Come on. We've got to keep him
from getting to that base.

17:19.070 --> 17:20.637
(GRUNTS)

17:29.848 --> 17:32.083
IRON MAN: Come on.
Didn't even slow him down.

17:36.055 --> 17:37.722
(GRUNTING)

17:46.165 --> 17:47.498
(BOTH GRUNTING)

17:57.076 --> 17:58.743
(PANTING)

18:00.212 --> 18:01.913
Show yourself.

18:01.915 --> 18:03.681
Hiding doesn't suit you.

18:03.683 --> 18:05.783
BLACK WIDOW:
Yelena...

18:05.785 --> 18:07.552
You may have been
the top of your class,

18:07.554 --> 18:10.221
but a Widow never stops
learning and adapting.

18:10.223 --> 18:13.191
And fighting!
(GRUNTS)

18:13.193 --> 18:15.293
There's room
for two of us.

18:15.295 --> 18:16.861
There's room
for all of us.

18:16.863 --> 18:18.663
I don't share!

18:19.231 --> 18:21.099
(GROANS)

18:21.101 --> 18:23.634
Nowhere left to run.

18:23.636 --> 18:25.203
Who said I was running?

18:27.806 --> 18:29.707
Just needed to reload.

18:31.310 --> 18:33.211
(BOTH GRUNTING)

18:35.547 --> 18:37.281
Why bother with me?

18:37.283 --> 18:39.817
Isn't that what you want?

18:39.819 --> 18:42.720
What is it?
Your memories.

18:42.722 --> 18:45.556
Your childhood
before the Red Room.

18:45.558 --> 18:48.326
Everything you could
ever wish to know

18:48.328 --> 18:51.295
about Natasha Romanoff.

18:51.297 --> 18:52.396
You're lying.

18:52.398 --> 18:54.098
Am I?

18:54.100 --> 18:56.167
Want to find out
who you are?

18:56.169 --> 19:00.238
How to break free from being
someone else's creation?

19:00.240 --> 19:02.306
This is your chance.

19:03.242 --> 19:04.442
That's the past.

19:04.444 --> 19:06.177
This is now.

19:06.179 --> 19:08.146
I'm happy with who I am.

19:08.148 --> 19:10.081
Want a chance
at the same?

19:10.083 --> 19:12.450
(LAUGHING)

19:12.452 --> 19:14.519
You can't help me.

19:14.521 --> 19:16.787
I'm made to destroy.

19:16.789 --> 19:19.023
Not while I have you.

19:19.025 --> 19:21.826
You never had me.

19:21.828 --> 19:24.862
See? I can learn after all.

19:24.864 --> 19:26.097
(GRUNTS)

19:38.544 --> 19:39.844
(GROANS)

19:43.682 --> 19:44.749
(GRUNTS)

19:50.155 --> 19:51.222
(GROANING)

19:56.628 --> 19:58.029
IRON MAN: Cap!

20:04.836 --> 20:06.070
BLACK WIDOW:
Hulk!

20:06.838 --> 20:08.072
Listen to me.

20:08.074 --> 20:10.107
You can still override
their control.

20:15.547 --> 20:17.248
You decide who you are...

20:17.250 --> 20:19.684
(GROWLING)
...what you can be,
not them.

20:19.686 --> 20:21.452
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

20:23.322 --> 20:25.256
(GRUNTS)

20:25.258 --> 20:27.391
This isn't you, Hulk.

20:27.393 --> 20:30.394
You're an Avenger.

20:30.396 --> 20:32.096
(GROWLING)

20:36.001 --> 20:37.668
(GROANING)

20:46.278 --> 20:48.412
(SCREAMING)

20:53.919 --> 20:55.319
(EXHALES)

20:56.388 --> 20:58.889
(SNORING)

20:58.891 --> 21:01.759
I never thought
I'd be so happy
to hear that snoring.

21:05.864 --> 21:07.531
Love snow days.

21:07.533 --> 21:11.769
Yeah, it used to remind me
of something from long ago.

21:11.771 --> 21:14.305
But today, it reminds me
of what I have now.

21:14.307 --> 21:15.640
What's this?

21:15.642 --> 21:17.808
Strucker's remote
that turned you.

21:18.977 --> 21:21.612
You could've used this
the whole time?

21:21.614 --> 21:24.882
I thought you should be
the one to choose
your own fate.

21:26.084 --> 21:29.487
(GRUNTS)
Like my life
the way it is.

21:29.489 --> 21:31.122
So do I.
