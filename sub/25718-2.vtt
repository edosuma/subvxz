00:54.179 --> 00:55.221
Kang Mi-rae.

01:11.112 --> 01:12.030
By any chance,

01:13.948 --> 01:15.825
did you go to Jaryong Middle School?

01:17.118 --> 01:17.952
What?

01:21.164 --> 01:23.792
<i>What should I do?</i>

01:27.629 --> 01:28.588
Forget it.

01:29.297 --> 01:31.758
You have the same name
as a girl I used to know.

01:43.228 --> 01:44.229
<i>I knew it.</i>

01:45.396 --> 01:47.232
<i>He is that Do Kyung-seok.</i>

01:53.613 --> 01:57.117
<i>There are those blessed ones</i>
<i>who turn any streets into their runway.</i>

01:57.700 --> 02:00.912
<i>The most handsome guy at</i>
<i>Jaryong Middle School, Do Kyung-seok.</i>

02:02.580 --> 02:04.707
<i>Even when he was just walking</i>

02:06.042 --> 02:08.336
<i>or participating in an earthquake drill,</i>

02:13.299 --> 02:15.593
<i>and even when he broke his arm.</i>

02:17.595 --> 02:19.722
<i>The world practically revolved around him.</i>

02:25.103 --> 02:28.189
<i>And the most legendary one of all was</i>

02:31.192 --> 02:34.154
<i>Do Kyung-seok walking in the rain.</i>

02:42.662 --> 02:45.165
<i>Then one day, he transferred</i>
<i>to a different school,</i>

02:45.790 --> 02:48.293
<i>but everyone at my school knew him.</i>

03:14.861 --> 03:16.738
<i>But I don't know you.</i>

03:18.406 --> 03:20.074
<i>I'll pretend I don't know you.</i>

03:35.256 --> 03:38.468
Oh, my goodness. He's grown up
into a fine, good-looking guy.

03:39.469 --> 03:42.597
Do you still see my old face
from how I look now?

03:42.680 --> 03:44.974
I can tell at a glance
that this girl is Sua.

03:45.058 --> 03:47.977
She must be much prettier in person.

03:49.979 --> 03:51.814
He won't ask me again, right?

03:51.898 --> 03:53.816
Will I tell a lie?

03:53.900 --> 03:57.278
I'll end up making a fool of myself
if someone else went to our school.

03:58.279 --> 04:01.407
I must say, you're on par with her.
You're pretty too.

04:03.701 --> 04:08.122
Hey, are you listening?
I'm asking you what I should do.

04:08.206 --> 04:11.709
Hey, he won't recognize you.
Even your dad couldn't.

04:11.793 --> 04:13.836
How will Do Kyung-seok
recognize you?

04:14.504 --> 04:17.130
He probably just wanted
to strike up a conversation.

04:18.007 --> 04:18.841
Hey, wait.

04:20.218 --> 04:21.844
What if he's interested in you?

04:21.928 --> 04:24.555
-Hey, what are you talking about?
-By the way,

04:25.056 --> 04:27.183
did something happen with him back then?

04:27.809 --> 04:29.227
How does he remember you?

04:30.478 --> 04:31.854
Oh!

05:04.804 --> 05:06.848
He was the same as everyone else.

05:08.850 --> 05:10.351
<i>Attention, please.</i>

05:10.435 --> 05:14.063
<i>Patient Lee Hyun-joo,</i>
<i>please come to the ICU.</i>

05:14.188 --> 05:17.191
-Can you tell me where Seo Yoo-jin is?
-Okay, let me check.

05:18.109 --> 05:20.361
My goodness.

05:20.445 --> 05:22.322
What did he throw at you?

05:22.405 --> 05:24.449
Why did he do this?

05:24.532 --> 05:26.868
Does it hurt a lot?
Kiss it better for you?

05:26.951 --> 05:28.077
Yes.

05:29.037 --> 05:30.747
-Here?
-No, it's here.

05:34.167 --> 05:35.918
Yoo-jin, does it feel better now?

05:36.002 --> 05:37.503
Of course.

05:38.004 --> 05:39.547
Gosh, I'm so upset.

05:40.131 --> 05:41.716
Hey, Kyung-seok, you're here.

05:42.508 --> 05:45.636
Hey, can you take her home? It's too late.

05:46.888 --> 05:48.056
Did you get kicked out?

05:49.140 --> 05:50.308
He got kicked out?

05:50.767 --> 05:51.768
Why?

05:52.435 --> 05:53.603
What's he saying?

05:53.686 --> 05:56.522
I told my dad that
I'm going to start my own business.

05:57.315 --> 05:58.274
What about the money?

05:58.941 --> 06:01.069
What? What business?

06:02.987 --> 06:03.905
A pub.

06:03.988 --> 06:05.865
You're going to start a pub?

06:07.408 --> 06:11.037
My goodness.
Then what about your dad's inheritance?

06:11.120 --> 06:12.538
I won't be getting anything.

06:13.164 --> 06:17.460
I'll let you drink free beer every day.

06:18.002 --> 06:20.713
Yoo-jin, I wasn't just
fooling around with you.

06:20.797 --> 06:22.548
I was even thinking to marry you.

06:24.008 --> 06:26.469
I can't believe
you're proposing to me right now.

06:26.552 --> 06:29.305
Stop right there.
The guy should be the one to propose.

06:29.389 --> 06:33.017
But this was not what I was expecting.
We can't see each other anymore.

06:33.101 --> 06:34.560
Ah-reum.

06:36.979 --> 06:38.064
Ah-reum.

06:39.023 --> 06:41.859
Ah-reum, wait. Please hear me out.

06:42.777 --> 06:43.903
-Taxi.
-Ah-reum.

06:44.904 --> 06:45.822
Let me go.

06:45.905 --> 06:48.282
Were you dating me
because of my family's money?

06:49.117 --> 06:50.952
You lost my trust.

06:51.536 --> 06:53.413
I didn't know you were this reckless.

06:53.496 --> 06:57.208
It's not because I'm materialistic.
It's because you're irresponsible.

07:03.089 --> 07:04.424
Hey, Ah-reum.

07:09.804 --> 07:12.306
You're completely fine.
Why were you lying in bed?

07:12.390 --> 07:15.393
You lost my trust.

07:18.688 --> 07:21.649
How can you make a joke
when I just had my heart broken?

07:22.024 --> 07:23.151
Then...

07:26.195 --> 07:28.489
Will I kiss it better for you?

07:28.573 --> 07:30.241
Gosh.

07:30.450 --> 07:31.284
Let's go.

07:33.661 --> 07:37.874
Hey, Kyung-seok. Kyung-seok!
Wait for me.

07:41.127 --> 07:43.838
She'd always tell me
that she doesn't want to go home.

07:43.921 --> 07:47.967
And every morning, she'd say,
"Yoo-jin, I dreamt of you last night."

07:50.845 --> 07:52.805
I can't believe
I'm still so bad with women.

07:53.431 --> 07:55.475
How many more women do I need to date?

07:56.517 --> 07:58.227
I guess I should date a bit more.

07:58.978 --> 08:02.148
Isn't it too early
to be thinking about dating other women?

08:03.232 --> 08:04.192
Where are we going?

08:04.692 --> 08:05.943
To your school.

08:07.403 --> 08:08.362
Let's go.

08:12.950 --> 08:14.494
When did you buy this place?

08:15.161 --> 08:17.788
The remodeling will begin
starting tomorrow.

08:18.664 --> 08:19.624
Hey.

08:20.833 --> 08:21.709
Drink up.

08:23.044 --> 08:25.004
Congratulations on entering university.

08:27.507 --> 08:28.549
Oh, that's bitter.

08:32.178 --> 08:35.472
It's okay with your dad? Isn't he
upset that you chose chemistry?

08:36.097 --> 08:37.099
Of course he's upset.

08:37.183 --> 08:38.851
Then why did you choose it?

08:39.977 --> 08:40.852
I don't know.

08:41.770 --> 08:44.941
I chose this major
because he kept telling me not to.

08:48.402 --> 08:50.571
Are you curious about your mom?

08:53.115 --> 08:54.617
Let's not talk about the dead.

08:58.162 --> 08:59.747
She's dead to me.

09:12.343 --> 09:17.807
My goodness gracious.

09:18.182 --> 09:19.308
Are you Mi-rae?

09:20.560 --> 09:22.228
Gosh, stop it.

09:22.770 --> 09:24.939
Hello. Have you been doing well?

09:25.022 --> 09:28.234
Yes, we've been doing well.

09:28.317 --> 09:30.486
-Have you been well?
-Yes.

09:30.570 --> 09:33.614
I think Hyun-jung should get something
done as well.

09:33.698 --> 09:34.824
Stop talking nonsense.

09:36.075 --> 09:39.328
I'll be off now. I'll see you guys later.

09:39.412 --> 09:40.246
Okay.

09:40.329 --> 09:42.748
-See you later.
-Bye. See you.

09:42.832 --> 09:44.500
-Bye.
-Bye.

09:45.167 --> 09:48.045
My gosh, she looks pretty
from the back as well.

09:49.297 --> 09:50.923
-I'll see you later.
-Okay.

09:54.343 --> 09:56.178
She has some guts.

09:56.262 --> 09:59.640
How could she get plastic surgery done
without telling her dad?

10:00.141 --> 10:03.352
You better not do anything behind my back.

10:10.568 --> 10:12.278
It's too loud.

10:16.198 --> 10:18.409
Who attends entrance ceremonies
these days?

10:20.703 --> 10:24.665
If I take photos with Kyung-seok, people
will comment on how different we look.

10:26.542 --> 10:28.419
My gosh, what was that? My goodness.

10:35.009 --> 10:36.719
I'd like to report an accident.

10:37.261 --> 10:39.513
No, I'm fine.

10:39.597 --> 10:42.433
But I'm not sure about the people
inside the car.

10:44.101 --> 10:45.311
Please make it quick.

10:45.394 --> 10:48.105
I can't afford to be late
to my deliveries.

10:48.689 --> 10:51.317
There's no need for that.
You must've been surprised.

10:51.901 --> 10:53.736
-Pardon?
-You can just go.

10:54.612 --> 10:56.822
-But still...
-It's okay.

10:56.906 --> 10:59.533
"Tell people how nice I am."

10:59.825 --> 11:01.702
"Take a good look at my face."

11:01.786 --> 11:03.788
"I'm Congressman Do Sang-won."

11:05.164 --> 11:05.998
Thank you.

11:06.832 --> 11:07.750
Keep working hard.

11:08.334 --> 11:09.585
-Thank you.
-No problem.

11:14.340 --> 11:15.841
Nice shot.

11:17.510 --> 11:18.552
Let's go.

11:36.445 --> 11:38.364
I'm near your school.
I'm almost there.

11:38.447 --> 11:42.284
Mom, when did Dad receive
his medical checkup?

11:42.827 --> 11:45.204
How's his blood pressure? Is it normal?

11:45.287 --> 11:48.457
Don't worry.
Where are you?

11:53.796 --> 11:57.091
What are you talking about?
What do you mean you can't find Dad?

12:02.596 --> 12:05.057
Excuse me, are you a student here?

12:06.100 --> 12:07.101
Pardon?

12:07.601 --> 12:10.646
I'm here for
my daughter's entrance ceremony.

12:11.230 --> 12:13.816
Is there a nice restaurant nearby?

12:13.899 --> 12:15.443
A place where girls like to go.

12:20.364 --> 12:22.825
Huh? Wait a minute.

12:25.494 --> 12:28.080
You're the girl I talked to last time.
Right?

12:30.708 --> 12:32.626
I'm Mi-rae's dad. She majors in chemistry.

12:32.710 --> 12:35.629
We talked on the phone
because you answered Mi-rae's phone.

12:37.214 --> 12:38.090
Yes.

12:40.342 --> 12:41.719
That was me.

12:41.802 --> 12:44.388
See? I knew it.
Yes, I remember your voice now.

12:44.972 --> 12:49.018
I was so surprised
because you sound just like my daughter.

12:51.187 --> 12:52.563
What a coincidence.

13:05.159 --> 13:06.827
Dad.

13:10.956 --> 13:12.541
Dad, I'm Mi-rae.

13:13.334 --> 13:14.376
What?

13:16.295 --> 13:19.256
Dad, I'm... I'm Mi-rae.

13:20.925 --> 13:22.092
It's me, Mi-rae.

13:25.471 --> 13:27.598
I'm your daughter, Mi-rae.

13:32.061 --> 13:35.314
What...

13:36.482 --> 13:37.316
Dad.

13:41.946 --> 13:45.658
Mi... Mi-rae...

13:46.617 --> 13:48.077
I'm sorry Dad.

13:48.619 --> 13:51.747
I had to keep it a secret
because you were so against it.

13:59.088 --> 14:01.632
Honey. Tae-sik.

14:10.766 --> 14:12.768
Dad.

14:12.852 --> 14:15.604
Honey.

14:16.105 --> 14:17.064
Honey.

14:25.114 --> 14:26.156
Dad.

14:30.995 --> 14:32.496
Dad.

14:33.956 --> 14:36.083
Dad.

14:39.587 --> 14:41.297
Dad.

14:42.590 --> 14:43.757
I'm sorry.

14:53.767 --> 14:55.769
I don't know you, miss.

15:16.457 --> 15:21.170
Nice. That looks great, Mr. Congressman.
I'll take a picture now, then. 1, 2, 3.

15:21.295 --> 15:23.672
Great. Kyung-hee, stand a little closer.

15:23.756 --> 15:27.468
All right, one more shot. 1, 2, 3!

15:27.551 --> 15:30.429
Oh, you look dashing, sir.
I really mean it.

15:30.512 --> 15:33.891
Yes. Kyung-hee, stand in the middle.
Here we go. 1, 2...

15:37.478 --> 15:38.479
Hello?

15:43.233 --> 15:44.360
Yes, hold on.

15:46.862 --> 15:49.698
She's been appointed
as the CEO of Kelun Korea.

15:52.534 --> 15:53.869
Talk about it another time.

15:54.787 --> 15:56.497
Can you at least gain some weight?

15:58.832 --> 16:01.210
My dear son,
we have to take a photo together.

16:01.293 --> 16:03.545
-Look at the camera.
-I love you.

16:04.213 --> 16:06.799
All right, I'll take another photo.

16:06.882 --> 16:09.218
My, I can't get over
how dashing you look, sir.

16:09.301 --> 16:11.887
All right. Oh, it was my face. There.

16:22.189 --> 16:23.273
Don't worry.

16:23.857 --> 16:27.361
I'll have a talk with your dad
when I get home. Okay?

16:43.377 --> 16:44.670
Hurry up!

16:45.379 --> 16:47.464
-Hurry. Come on!
-My goodness.

16:47.756 --> 16:50.009
Why? What is going on?

16:52.136 --> 16:53.429
Mi-rae, you're here too.

16:54.471 --> 16:55.806
Ta-da.

16:55.889 --> 16:57.808
Whose camera is it?
Did you buy it?

16:57.891 --> 16:59.518
No, I borrowed it.

16:59.768 --> 17:02.771
We should take some photos together
now that I own this taxi.

17:02.855 --> 17:05.441
I no longer have to share it
with other drivers,

17:05.523 --> 17:08.109
so I want to hang a photo of Mi-rae
inside my taxi.

17:08.944 --> 17:12.781
Mi-rae, come stand here.
I'll take a pretty photo of you.

17:14.116 --> 17:17.618
Dad. Can you not take a photo of me?

17:20.372 --> 17:22.958
I want to hang your photo inside my taxi.

17:23.041 --> 17:26.295
Seeing your face will keep me
energized throughout the day.

17:28.130 --> 17:30.007
It's my wish.

17:33.343 --> 17:34.428
All right, then.

17:35.971 --> 17:37.723
-Come on.
-Come stand here.

17:38.223 --> 17:40.851
Not there. You should stand right here.

17:40.934 --> 17:43.020
-We're ready!
-Here we go.

17:44.188 --> 17:48.776
Honey, get out of the frame. Come on.
I'll take a photo of Mi-rae first.

17:50.360 --> 17:52.488
All right. Mi-rae, smile.

17:52.571 --> 17:54.156
-Give me a pretty smile.
-Smile.

17:54.239 --> 17:56.700
1, 2, 3.

17:58.202 --> 17:59.703
All right. One more time.

17:59.787 --> 18:03.999
Okay, here we go. 1, 2, 3.

18:31.693 --> 18:32.778
Isn't that Mi-rae?

18:33.612 --> 18:35.781
-Hello.
-Hi.

18:36.115 --> 18:38.117
Are you two in this class too?

18:38.242 --> 18:39.493
-You too?
-Yes.

18:39.576 --> 18:41.328
That's great. Let's sit together.

18:42.121 --> 18:45.958
We studied so hard to get into university,
and we now have to study more.

18:46.166 --> 18:48.669
Are we writing up reports now?

18:48.752 --> 18:51.338
I didn't know
when I was registering for my courses,

18:51.421 --> 18:53.924
but it really hit me
on the day of my first class.

18:58.220 --> 18:59.972
Mi-rae! Hi.

19:00.722 --> 19:04.059
-Mi-rae is here.
-Mi-rae.

19:05.519 --> 19:08.480
-Hi, Mi-rae.
-Hi.

19:08.564 --> 19:10.607
-Sua!
-Sua!

19:10.691 --> 19:12.276
-Hyun Sua is here.
-Hi.

19:12.359 --> 19:13.277
Hi.

19:13.360 --> 19:15.863
Hello.
Hi. Hi, Mi-rae.

19:16.363 --> 19:18.448
-Hi, Sua.
-How have you been?

19:19.032 --> 19:20.951
-Good.
-I'll see you later.

19:22.452 --> 19:24.621
-Jung-hyun.
-Hey, you.

19:24.705 --> 19:27.791
-She's like a celebrity in our department.
-I know, right?

19:27.916 --> 19:29.626
Sua is making my life difficult.

19:29.710 --> 19:32.296
Why do guys keep asking me
to set them up with her?

19:32.379 --> 19:33.463
Mi-rae.

19:36.675 --> 19:37.759
Hello.

19:38.635 --> 19:41.805
-Sit here. I saved this seat for you.
-Pardon me?

20:01.867 --> 20:03.744
Are you taking General Chemistry too?

20:03.827 --> 20:06.955
No, I got an A in this class
in my first year.

20:07.539 --> 20:09.041
Oh, I see.

20:10.459 --> 20:12.044
Then what are you doing here?

20:12.127 --> 20:14.546
What do you think? I came to see you.

20:16.673 --> 20:18.383
What on earth is he doing here?

20:18.467 --> 20:20.177
Does he have to retake this class?

20:20.260 --> 20:22.804
It looks like
he's trying to hit on Mi-rae.

20:23.388 --> 20:27.476
Right, when Mi-rae walked in earlier,
I could see how much she stands out.

20:27.809 --> 20:28.644
Really?

20:30.229 --> 20:32.314
But as soon as Sua walked in...

20:32.773 --> 20:34.942
What? Did you call me?

20:35.400 --> 20:37.361
No, no. I didn't call you.

20:38.445 --> 20:40.614
I'm such an idiot.

20:40.697 --> 20:44.368
I wanted to call you but I realized
that I never asked your number.

20:46.495 --> 20:47.663
I see.

20:47.746 --> 20:50.332
What's up?
Did the entrance ceremony go well?

20:51.541 --> 20:52.376
Yes.

20:52.459 --> 20:55.587
If there's anything you don't understand,
feel free to ask me.

20:55.671 --> 20:57.589
I got an A in General Chemistry.

20:58.840 --> 21:02.219
Also, I have all the exam notes
for this class.

21:02.302 --> 21:04.554
This professor's exams are the same
every year.

21:04.638 --> 21:06.640
Do you know what I mean by "exam notes"?

21:06.723 --> 21:10.269
It seems like you can only see Mi-rae.
We'll need them, too.

21:10.352 --> 21:13.981
Figure it our yourself.
Mi-rae and I have a special relationship.

21:14.856 --> 21:15.691
Me?

21:15.774 --> 21:17.651
We did couple drinking.
Didn't we?

21:21.071 --> 21:24.116
Oh, shall we have lunch together
at the cafeteria?

21:24.199 --> 21:25.284
Sorry?

21:25.367 --> 21:28.412
Today's menu looks amazing.
Girls, you'd better not come.

21:37.587 --> 21:39.047
Mi-rae, let's sit over there.

21:52.519 --> 21:54.646
This is on me, so eat everything you want.

21:55.564 --> 21:56.440
Thank you.

22:01.236 --> 22:03.739
How is it?
The food at our cafeteria is quite good.

22:04.239 --> 22:06.241
-Yes, it's good.
-Good.

22:16.293 --> 22:17.419
You know...

22:19.171 --> 22:21.131
I asked you if I can like you.

22:22.299 --> 22:24.509
I think you've had enough time to ponder.

22:26.511 --> 22:28.930
Should we not talk about it at school?

22:29.014 --> 22:31.850
Shall we go to a nice bar in the evening?

22:34.436 --> 22:36.980
-Do you want some water?
-No, it's okay.

22:37.064 --> 22:39.191
-I'll use the restroom quickly.
-All right.

22:42.402 --> 22:44.780
Gosh, why is she acting all naive?

22:49.659 --> 22:51.078
Hello, Chan-woo.

22:51.661 --> 22:52.662
Sua.

22:54.790 --> 22:58.585
You're in the same General Chemistry class
with us, right?

22:59.503 --> 23:03.173
Oh, I'm not actually in the class.
I just stopped by to see you guys.

23:03.256 --> 23:07.636
I was wondering
why you were retaking a first-year course.

23:08.261 --> 23:09.805
Oh, were you curious?

23:11.348 --> 23:13.517
-Have a seat. We can chat.
-Sure.

23:17.229 --> 23:21.274
Isn't somebody else sitting here?

23:21.358 --> 23:24.361
-It's Mi-rae. She went to the restroom.
-I see.

23:26.363 --> 23:29.366
Chan-woo, you like Mi-rae, don't you?

23:29.449 --> 23:34.454
Well, I think all of you are adorable.
That includes you.

23:34.579 --> 23:37.874
Just talk casually to me.
You don't need to be so polite.

23:39.376 --> 23:43.213
I think you and Mi-rae
will make a cute couple.

23:44.756 --> 23:47.008
Well, we're not there yet.

23:48.510 --> 23:50.137
I'll be cheering for you.

23:51.430 --> 23:52.931
Although I'm a little sad.

23:54.433 --> 23:55.308
What do you mean?

23:57.102 --> 24:00.105
Nothing. Never mind.
I should get going now.

24:00.313 --> 24:01.481
Hey, wait.

24:02.482 --> 24:05.360
What did you mean by that?
Why are you sad?

24:05.444 --> 24:06.611
Well...

24:06.736 --> 24:08.029
Oh, sorry.

24:12.325 --> 24:13.577
I can sit here, right?

24:14.703 --> 24:18.373
Hey, how could you ignore
all of my messages for three days?

24:18.748 --> 24:20.000
I guess you've been busy.

24:20.083 --> 24:21.543
I don't check my phone often.

24:21.668 --> 24:24.337
Goodness,
that's why you don't have a girlfriend.

24:25.630 --> 24:26.506
Come on, tell me.

24:27.549 --> 24:29.217
To tell you the truth,

24:29.885 --> 24:34.306
I was quite smitten by you
at the freshmen orientation.

24:35.223 --> 24:36.433
What? Me?

24:37.100 --> 24:39.186
Don't take it too seriously though.

24:39.269 --> 24:42.939
I'm over you now,
so you don't need to care too much. Okay?

24:43.398 --> 24:44.483
No, wait.

24:52.240 --> 24:53.200
Gosh.

24:54.159 --> 24:55.202
I can't believe...

24:59.873 --> 25:01.041
I'm sorry.

25:02.042 --> 25:04.836
I just want to think of you as my senior.

25:09.216 --> 25:11.885
I just want to think of you as my senior.

25:13.053 --> 25:16.223
I just want to think of you
as my senior...

25:21.019 --> 25:23.271
-Chan-woo.
-Hey, Mi-rae.

25:23.355 --> 25:25.565
Let's just be friends. Okay?

25:26.483 --> 25:27.400
Pardon?

25:27.484 --> 25:30.946
What I said to you was a mistake.

25:31.696 --> 25:35.325
I think I was confused.
I actually like someone else.

25:35.408 --> 25:37.369
I'm sorry for making things complicated.

25:37.827 --> 25:40.455
I'm sorry.
You understand what I'm saying, right?

25:40.705 --> 25:44.000
I'm sorry if you took it seriously.
Is everything okay?

25:44.084 --> 25:45.627
You can finish your meal.

26:01.685 --> 26:03.853
Sorry, my mistake.

26:05.021 --> 26:06.856
Is it you again, you jerk?

26:09.734 --> 26:11.152
What did you just say?

26:11.736 --> 26:12.779
"Mistake"?

26:14.614 --> 26:15.574
Do you want to die?

26:16.449 --> 26:18.451
Huh? My gosh.

26:19.953 --> 26:21.288
This is a mistake as well.

26:26.209 --> 26:27.294
You must want to die.

26:29.337 --> 26:30.213
I'm done eating.

26:30.755 --> 26:33.258
You must be crazy for a beating. Hey!

26:38.179 --> 26:40.181
-What's wrong with him?
-My gosh.

26:41.975 --> 26:44.561
You little jerk.
I'm going to kill you.

26:47.689 --> 26:49.774
-Chan-woo.
-What are you doing?

26:49.858 --> 26:51.860
Are you taking his side? Move!

27:20.597 --> 27:22.432
Chan-woo, what are you doing?

27:22.515 --> 27:24.851
-Let go of me!
-Everyone's staring.

27:24.934 --> 27:28.104
-What's his problem?
-My gosh.

27:28.188 --> 27:31.483
-Why is he always causing trouble?
-Let me go.

27:32.067 --> 27:33.943
You better consider yourself lucky.

27:34.027 --> 27:36.404
I'm going to kill you
the next time I see you. Okay?

27:37.530 --> 27:39.407
Why is he always causing trouble?

27:39.866 --> 27:42.410
What a joke. Isn't he the jerk
from chemistry?

27:42.494 --> 27:44.621
-What was that?
-Oh, gosh.

27:45.163 --> 27:46.206
Are you okay?

27:55.548 --> 27:58.343
My gosh. I'm sorry.

28:17.278 --> 28:19.239
They were fighting like crazy.

28:20.782 --> 28:22.784
Do you know what Chan-woo's nickname is?

28:25.078 --> 28:27.497
It's SOJ. It stands for son of a jerk.

28:30.583 --> 28:32.585
You need to be careful of guys like him.

28:32.919 --> 28:35.797
Sua, you better watch out as well.

28:36.840 --> 28:37.757
Okay.

28:40.635 --> 28:41.970
What? Oh, okay.

28:43.263 --> 28:44.681
Oh, well...

28:44.889 --> 28:47.809
What do you think about having chicken
and beer after class?

28:48.309 --> 28:49.436
Are you up for it?

28:52.063 --> 28:56.317
Well, I'm up for it if Sua is.

28:58.236 --> 28:59.654
My gosh.

29:06.161 --> 29:08.246
Sorry, my mistake.

29:10.373 --> 29:11.624
How cute.

29:16.129 --> 29:16.963
What?

29:17.046 --> 29:20.300
She thinks you're cute.

29:22.719 --> 29:25.263
Sua, there you are.

29:26.181 --> 29:28.057
-Hello.
-Hi.

29:29.058 --> 29:31.811
Can we talk outside in private?

29:33.104 --> 29:33.938
Sure.

29:34.606 --> 29:35.982
I'll wait for you outside.

29:46.659 --> 29:50.121
What I'm about to tell you comes from
the bottom of my heart.

29:50.205 --> 29:51.498
So please hear me out.

29:53.082 --> 29:54.542
-Okay.
-Right.

29:54.918 --> 30:00.173
Guys always have their own ideal type
of girl in mind.

30:00.757 --> 30:01.883
The same goes for me.

30:01.966 --> 30:05.970
When I first saw you,
my heart almost dropped to the ground.

30:06.387 --> 30:09.557
I'll be straightforward with you.
You're my ideal type of girl.

30:10.433 --> 30:14.687
You're the only one I was interested in
ever since the freshmen welcoming party.

30:15.355 --> 30:16.856
You might not believe me,

30:18.483 --> 30:21.778
but I tend to get really shy
around the person I like.

30:21.861 --> 30:26.282
But now that
I know you feel the same way about me,

30:26.366 --> 30:29.577
I was wondering
if you'd like to start going out with me.

30:29.661 --> 30:32.455
Then what about Mi-rae?

30:33.623 --> 30:35.959
I was nice to her
because she was in my team,

30:36.042 --> 30:38.169
and she did good in the talent show.

30:38.253 --> 30:40.046
You were the only girl I liked.

30:42.465 --> 30:43.466
Sua.

30:46.553 --> 30:50.348
I'm really grateful
that you think of me that way.

30:50.557 --> 30:51.391
Okay.

30:51.683 --> 30:54.310
But can you give me some time
to think about it?

30:55.436 --> 30:57.605
Yes, of course. You should think about it.

30:57.689 --> 31:00.817
Although it won't be a problem
since we both like each other.

31:00.900 --> 31:03.403
Anyway, well...

31:04.153 --> 31:07.323
I'll wait for your call.

31:09.450 --> 31:10.368
Bye.

31:15.498 --> 31:16.416
Sua.

31:20.253 --> 31:21.254
Did anything happen?

31:21.838 --> 31:23.756
What? What do you mean?

31:24.632 --> 31:27.218
Is Chan-woo hitting on you?

31:28.595 --> 31:29.762
No.

31:30.597 --> 31:33.182
He just said
what all the other seniors said to me.

31:33.349 --> 31:35.977
He told me to let him know
if I need any help.

31:36.686 --> 31:40.773
Who else said that to you?
Jung-hwan? Jin-wook?

31:46.237 --> 31:48.448
I can't believe he made a fool out of me.

31:49.365 --> 31:51.826
Do I still seem like a joke to everyone?

31:53.119 --> 31:57.040
Remember when I asked you
if it'd be okay for me to like you?

31:57.123 --> 31:59.459
-Chan-woo.
-Hey, Mi-rae.

31:59.542 --> 32:02.462
What I said to you was a mistake.

32:03.671 --> 32:07.425
I think I was confused.
I actually like someone else.

32:35.203 --> 32:36.037
Are you okay?

32:44.253 --> 32:45.129
Are you okay?

32:48.341 --> 32:50.551
I was looking for you
because I was worried.

32:51.386 --> 32:54.764
I heard Chan-woo and Kyung-seok
had a fight at the cafeteria.

32:55.974 --> 32:58.643
I heard Chan-woo even pushed you.

32:59.978 --> 33:01.396
Did you get hurt?

33:02.855 --> 33:03.982
No.

33:05.483 --> 33:06.776
What happened?

33:07.735 --> 33:10.738
I thought things were going well
between you and Chan-woo.

33:15.118 --> 33:16.619
What's going on?

33:17.787 --> 33:18.871
I don't know.

33:19.539 --> 33:22.208
He asked me to go out,
but then said it was a mistake.

33:23.042 --> 33:26.879
Is that why Kyung-seok got mad
and fought with him?

33:27.505 --> 33:31.050
No, they fought
because Kyung-seok made Chan-woo trip.

33:32.010 --> 33:33.261
I see.

33:35.847 --> 33:36.848
Do you...

33:38.725 --> 33:40.685
have a crush on Chan-woo?

33:41.269 --> 33:42.145
No.

33:44.105 --> 33:45.273
Not at all.

33:45.356 --> 33:48.484
I'm so relieved that
he doesn't actually have feelings for me.

33:48.609 --> 33:51.654
Yes, don't let it bother you.

33:52.238 --> 33:56.993
Have you heard?
Chan-woo's nickname is SOJ. Son of Jerk.

33:57.076 --> 34:00.788
He should behave himself as a senior.
Why does he have to bother freshmen?

34:00.872 --> 34:02.623
He's so annoying.

34:06.794 --> 34:09.047
Just forget about it.
Don't take it to heart.

34:09.255 --> 34:10.465
You have me, you know.

34:11.215 --> 34:13.926
<i>I have you?</i>

34:14.510 --> 34:16.429
We'll be late for our class. Let's go.

34:18.097 --> 34:19.223
Okay.

34:20.933 --> 34:24.103
If he bothers my friend again,
I'll teach him a serious lesson.

34:24.187 --> 34:25.813
<i>"My friend"?</i>

34:25.938 --> 34:28.274
Friends must help each other.
Aren't I right?

34:29.108 --> 34:31.152
Yes, thanks.

34:31.902 --> 34:35.989
You just smiled. Do you feel better now?

34:39.534 --> 34:40.911
<i>She's an angel.</i>

34:42.830 --> 34:45.458
Yes, I'm totally fine now.

34:47.210 --> 34:50.797
Hello, I'm Yeon Woo-young.
I'll be helping you with your experiments.

34:55.760 --> 34:58.763
First, I'll explain
how the experiments will work.

34:58.846 --> 35:00.890
After that, you'll split up into teams.

35:02.141 --> 35:04.811
-We're sorry.
-We're sorry.

35:06.521 --> 35:11.651
You'll do all experiments in teams.
Each team will consist of 5 to 6 students.

35:11.734 --> 35:14.654
You'll be graded as teams,
so please help each other out.

35:15.446 --> 35:18.282
Let's split you into teams.
We'll do a random draw.

35:18.908 --> 35:21.911
I can't believe we have to do
team experiments in this class.

35:21.994 --> 35:25.414
Gosh, I really hope I can team up
with someone I know.

35:25.498 --> 35:27.500
-I heard this is hard.
-Somebody I know.

35:28.209 --> 35:31.129
Someone I know, please.

35:33.422 --> 35:34.298
Team 3

35:36.884 --> 35:38.511
Mi-rae, are you in Team One?

35:39.095 --> 35:40.346
No, Team Three.

35:40.888 --> 35:42.473
Won-ho, are you in Team Three?

35:42.598 --> 35:45.643
I was worried. Thank goodness
one teammate is someone I know.

35:45.726 --> 35:47.895
Gosh, you idiot.

35:49.272 --> 35:51.649
I hope there's a pretty girl in our team.

35:53.442 --> 35:55.903
Hey, Won-ho. Are both of you in this team?

35:56.487 --> 35:58.656
-What are you doing here?
-What?

35:58.739 --> 36:01.576
I was hoping a pretty girl would join us.
Why you?

36:01.659 --> 36:03.578
-Are you dumb?
-Whatever, Ji-hyo.

36:03.661 --> 36:07.373
You're the type to go off the grid
when we have a group assignment.

36:07.456 --> 36:08.875
Shall I teach you a lesson?

36:08.958 --> 36:10.084
I want to live.

36:12.086 --> 36:15.548
I bet Won-ho will enlist in the army
after getting dumped by a girl.

36:16.507 --> 36:19.719
You'll be a total outcast
when you join the military, you idiot.

36:19.802 --> 36:21.721
-Totally.
-Okay.

36:23.514 --> 36:24.849
Are you in Team Three too?

36:25.391 --> 36:26.767
-Yes.
-Me too.

36:27.560 --> 36:29.020
We're in the same team, then.

36:29.103 --> 36:30.271
-Really?
-Yes.

36:32.648 --> 36:35.568
Is Sua the last one to join our team?

36:35.693 --> 36:36.694
Is this Team Three?

36:40.656 --> 36:44.952
This is amazing. All the celebrities
of the first year are in our team.

36:45.536 --> 36:46.704
-"Celebrities"?
-Yes.

36:46.787 --> 36:49.081
You and Kyung-seok are very famous.

36:51.083 --> 36:52.627
So is Mi-rae.

36:56.547 --> 36:59.091
Each team leader
needs to guide the team members

36:59.175 --> 37:00.927
and make sure to submit the reports.

37:01.969 --> 37:04.180
What should we do?
Are there any volunteers?

37:07.266 --> 37:08.851
How about Mi-rae?

37:09.393 --> 37:10.228
Me?

37:11.103 --> 37:14.398
She seems very mature,
so I think she'll be a great team leader.

37:16.484 --> 37:17.735
I'm not sure.

37:18.277 --> 37:19.403
I'll just do it.

37:24.075 --> 37:25.618
Then I'll be our note taker.

37:29.372 --> 37:31.082
Do we need a manager?

37:36.671 --> 37:39.340
It's that girl,
the celebrity of Hankook University.

37:40.174 --> 37:41.384
She's really pretty.

37:41.759 --> 37:42.969
She's already so famous.

37:43.052 --> 37:45.638
Guys at other schools
are asking me about Hyun Sua.

37:46.347 --> 37:47.765
-Hyun Sua?
-Yes.

37:50.351 --> 37:51.185
I see.

38:06.325 --> 38:07.785
I like soda too.

38:09.412 --> 38:13.541
What are you good-looking people
doing here? Are you two dating already?

38:13.624 --> 38:16.335
Please stop.
He hates hearing things like that.

38:16.419 --> 38:19.714
Sua, what guy wouldn't want to date you?

38:26.846 --> 38:28.055
Can you give me that?

38:29.765 --> 38:30.975
Buy one with your money.

38:33.728 --> 38:35.646
I was just kidding.

38:37.773 --> 38:41.152
They're just standing, and yet
it looks like a scene from a movie.

38:41.235 --> 38:43.571
They're making our school
look like a film set.

38:43.654 --> 38:45.531
It'll be crazy
if they actually date.

38:45.614 --> 38:46.824
Right?

38:47.325 --> 38:48.492
Yes, totally.

38:51.454 --> 38:53.664
-Thanks for the drink.
-Mi-rae.

39:00.379 --> 39:01.714
Let's have a quick talk.

39:05.634 --> 39:08.471
What's going on?
A secret chat between just you and him?

39:09.263 --> 39:10.890
We don't have any secrets.

39:11.640 --> 39:12.516
Go on.

39:14.226 --> 39:15.144
Okay.

39:18.647 --> 39:20.983
What's going on?
What could it be about?

39:22.526 --> 39:23.694
I'm not sure.

39:26.030 --> 39:28.324
-This is yours, right?
-Yes.

39:29.617 --> 39:32.411
-It was on the cafeteria floor.
-I see.

39:35.414 --> 39:36.248
What?

39:36.332 --> 39:39.126
Are you really not Mi-rae
from Jaryong Middle School?

39:41.796 --> 39:42.755
The bus stop.

39:44.590 --> 39:45.424
Pomelo.

39:57.103 --> 39:58.020
Don't tell anyone.

39:58.604 --> 40:00.898
-About what?
-What I used to look like.

40:03.526 --> 40:04.527
Keep it to yourself.

40:10.991 --> 40:11.992
Kyung-seok.

40:13.452 --> 40:14.453
Do Kyung-seok.

40:16.163 --> 40:17.289
See you.

40:36.517 --> 40:37.351
Hey.

40:39.395 --> 40:40.813
Are you wearing perfume?

40:40.896 --> 40:42.898
KANG MI-RAE

40:46.402 --> 40:49.029
Yes. Am I not even allowed
to wear perfume?

41:18.517 --> 41:21.854
<i>Will my undergraduate years end up</i>
<i>turning into another disaster?</i>

41:24.607 --> 41:26.150
<i>Pomelo.</i>

41:27.026 --> 41:31.238
<i>By the way,</i>
<i>how does he remember my perfume?</i>

41:42.833 --> 41:46.378
There will be a freshman week party here.
For your department.

41:47.338 --> 41:48.547
I have so much to do.

41:55.304 --> 41:56.305
Help me put this up.

41:57.681 --> 41:59.600
I haven't found a part-timer yet.

42:01.560 --> 42:04.396
Kyung-seok, please?

42:08.734 --> 42:10.402
Kyung-seok, help me with this.

42:15.241 --> 42:17.368
I must say, you're such a nice guy.

42:17.701 --> 42:18.619
Shut it.

42:19.203 --> 42:20.913
Although you're very rude to me.

42:22.081 --> 42:23.749
I mean, you're nice. So nice.

42:28.796 --> 42:31.799
By the way, who's that girl?
No way.

42:32.341 --> 42:34.009
Are you interested in girls now?

42:34.843 --> 42:37.972
Or was she hitting on you? Tell me.

42:40.933 --> 42:42.184
Don't tell anyone.

42:43.352 --> 42:44.812
What I used to look like.

42:47.189 --> 42:48.482
Keep it to yourself.

42:52.027 --> 42:54.405
-Are you an idiot or what?
-Hey.

42:54.488 --> 42:58.367
That totally startled me. How could you...
You're not nice at all.

42:59.326 --> 43:01.120
I take back what I said earlier.

43:05.082 --> 43:06.250
Shall I...

43:07.376 --> 43:09.670
just not go to the freshman week party?

43:09.920 --> 43:14.258
Don't you worry.
He doesn't even care about you.

43:15.217 --> 43:16.802
I mean, don't you know him?

43:18.846 --> 43:20.681
But still, I'll be so uncomfortable.

43:22.891 --> 43:23.809
Hey.

43:24.935 --> 43:28.981
It's not like you spent all that money
and risked your life to get the surgery

43:29.064 --> 43:30.899
so that you can keep avoiding people.

43:35.321 --> 43:36.488
Right.

43:37.197 --> 43:40.701
Or should I go ask him
for a favor in person?

43:41.785 --> 43:45.205
How about you get close with him
and make him on our side?

43:47.875 --> 43:51.128
It'll be more of a hassle
if things go worse.

43:52.171 --> 43:54.381
Let's wait and see for now.

43:54.465 --> 43:57.134
It's because you're anxious.

43:59.219 --> 44:00.512
Still,

44:01.972 --> 44:06.769
I have a friend in my department who'll
take my side if something happens to me.

44:07.519 --> 44:08.562
Who is that?

44:10.689 --> 44:11.607
Hyun Sua.

44:15.027 --> 44:16.612
Have you become close with her?

44:17.613 --> 44:18.447
Yes.

44:36.131 --> 44:38.342
I'm telling you, he's interested in you.

44:38.467 --> 44:40.886
-No way.
-This is really frustrating.

44:41.595 --> 44:44.598
He should've returned the perfume
to you when we were there.

44:44.682 --> 44:46.141
Why did he call you outside?

44:46.225 --> 44:48.227
That's really not it.

45:06.870 --> 45:09.123
-Mi-rae.
-Hi.

45:09.206 --> 45:10.374
Hi, Mi-rae.

45:10.457 --> 45:13.210
-Hello.
-Hi.

45:14.336 --> 45:16.171
What is Kyung-seok doing over there?

45:16.255 --> 45:18.632
The owner here is his close friend.

45:18.716 --> 45:20.968
-Is that right?
-Hello.

45:21.552 --> 45:22.469
-Hello.
-Hello.

45:23.137 --> 45:24.304
This is on the house.

45:25.723 --> 45:28.225
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

45:29.852 --> 45:32.396
Welcome to the start
of the freshman week party!

45:32.896 --> 45:35.315
-Hello.
-Welcome.

45:35.399 --> 45:37.735
-Hi.
-Hello.

45:42.573 --> 45:44.575
I care more about face than body figure.

45:44.658 --> 45:48.120
It's a no for me if she's ugly
no matter how nice her figure is.

45:48.203 --> 45:49.955
Face can be fixed.

45:50.789 --> 45:54.793
Whatever. Sua. What do you care the most
when it comes to men?

45:55.252 --> 45:56.670
Well...

45:57.963 --> 46:00.966
I think personality matters the most.

46:05.429 --> 46:07.556
-Great.
-What are you doing? Sit down.

46:08.807 --> 46:09.683
What's that?

46:09.767 --> 46:12.060
All the seniors are gathered around Sua.

46:14.938 --> 46:17.441
How about we play the image game?

46:17.524 --> 46:20.277
-Sure, that sounds fun.
-Let's play the image game.

46:20.360 --> 46:22.362
-I'll go first. Let's go this way.
-Okay.

46:23.197 --> 46:25.491
I'll start with a weak question.

46:26.074 --> 46:29.745
Who do you think was most delinquent
in high school?

46:30.287 --> 46:31.872
1, 2, 3.

46:32.790 --> 46:34.458
Mi-rae has got all the votes.

46:36.084 --> 46:37.169
It's not true though.

46:37.252 --> 46:38.587
-Bottoms up.
-Bottoms up.

46:40.714 --> 46:44.384
It's my turn.
Who do you think dated the most among us?

46:44.885 --> 46:46.428
1, 2, 3.

46:48.764 --> 46:51.433
It's me again?
I've never dated anyone.

46:51.517 --> 46:54.228
-Alcohol is drinking me.
-I am drinking alcohol.

46:54.311 --> 46:55.187
-Kang!
-Kang!

46:55.771 --> 46:56.814
-Mi!
-Mi!

46:57.105 --> 46:58.106
-Rae!
-Rae!

46:58.482 --> 46:59.983
-Bottoms up!
-Bottoms up!

47:01.693 --> 47:03.862
She's so cool. Mi-rae's good at drinking.

47:05.531 --> 47:08.242
-Hey, it's your turn.
-Oh, right.

47:09.827 --> 47:11.036
-What should I do?
-Gosh.

47:11.119 --> 47:12.704
Hold on.

47:14.498 --> 47:15.415
Are you okay?

47:16.124 --> 47:17.042
Yes.

47:18.961 --> 47:20.337
Well, I don't know.

47:21.463 --> 47:22.965
Oh, okay.

47:23.048 --> 47:26.051
Who do you think
kissed the earliest among us?

47:26.134 --> 47:28.720
-You mean, kiss? Not a peck?
-Kiss.

47:28.804 --> 47:30.639
1, 2, 3.

47:33.058 --> 47:34.017
Kyung-seok, it's you.

47:34.101 --> 47:35.519
-Wait, hold on.
-What?

47:35.602 --> 47:36.979
Who voted for him?

47:37.396 --> 47:39.064
1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

47:39.147 --> 47:41.483
Who voted for Mi-rae?
1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

47:41.567 --> 47:43.694
It's half and half.
A couple drinking?

47:43.819 --> 47:44.820
-Will do.
-Will do.

47:45.445 --> 47:49.491
-Couple drinking.
-Couple drinking.

47:49.575 --> 47:51.159
We'll just drink separately.

47:51.952 --> 47:54.079
Yes, she's drinking
three times in a row.

47:54.830 --> 47:56.164
I'll drink two shots then.

47:56.248 --> 47:57.875
Wow.

48:01.211 --> 48:03.255
He's really good at drinking.

48:03.338 --> 48:04.172
Oh, Kyung-seok.

48:04.256 --> 48:06.008
-Give me that.
-What?

48:09.428 --> 48:10.262
Thank you.

48:10.345 --> 48:13.140
Shouldn't he make a wish for this favor?

48:14.308 --> 48:15.475
Great!

48:15.559 --> 48:17.895
I think they really have something.

48:17.978 --> 48:19.146
I guess so.

48:21.732 --> 48:23.358
He's cool.

48:25.652 --> 48:26.862
It's my turn now, right?

48:27.696 --> 48:32.451
Who do you think got the most professions
from the opposite sex?

48:34.161 --> 48:35.913
1, 2, 3.

48:38.040 --> 48:42.044
Me? No, that never happened for me.

48:42.127 --> 48:45.130
Come on. It's the image game,
not truth or dare.

48:48.842 --> 48:50.302
-Drink!
-Drink it.

48:50.469 --> 48:51.929
I drank a lot already though.

48:54.139 --> 48:57.142
-Drink.
-Drink it.

48:58.977 --> 49:00.479
Goodness.

49:00.562 --> 49:02.773
Is he out of his mind?

49:04.024 --> 49:05.651
Are you really going to do it?

49:07.778 --> 49:11.740
Sua, can you stand up for a second?

49:13.325 --> 49:14.534
Why?

49:18.830 --> 49:21.875
Freshman Week Party
for Chemistry Department

49:23.335 --> 49:27.589
Actually, I wasn't thinking of expressing
my feelings for you this soon.

49:28.382 --> 49:30.801
But there were just too many guys
going for you,

49:30.884 --> 49:33.345
so I thought
I should make you mine quickly.

49:34.930 --> 49:37.307
-It's crazy.
-Goodness.

49:37.391 --> 49:38.684
It's too corny.

49:41.436 --> 49:44.189
I like you.
Would you like to go out with me?

49:49.361 --> 49:50.487
What a man.

49:53.448 --> 49:54.491
Great.

49:58.954 --> 49:59.955
I...

50:00.455 --> 50:04.459
I never imagined
you'd think of me this way.

50:06.503 --> 50:11.174
But I don't think I'm ready
to go out with someone yet.

50:13.051 --> 50:13.885
I'm sorry.

50:17.264 --> 50:18.473
Still,

50:19.641 --> 50:23.812
we're good friends to each other.
We'll stay the same, right?

50:24.646 --> 50:25.564
Right?

50:27.566 --> 50:30.610
Of course, we're all friends.

50:31.820 --> 50:34.239
Right?
Let's go take some fresh air.

50:34.322 --> 50:38.535
Gosh, that idiot doesn't know
who she likes.

50:38.618 --> 50:40.537
-Hope you become closer.
-Be friends.

50:40.996 --> 50:42.247
Just be friends.

50:49.504 --> 50:50.422
Goodness.

50:50.505 --> 50:51.673
Are you having fun?

50:51.757 --> 50:53.759
-Hello.
-Hello.

51:06.229 --> 51:08.273
Face the reality.

51:08.356 --> 51:10.233
I told you not to do it.

51:10.734 --> 51:13.528
You think it makes sense
to profess to a girl

51:13.612 --> 51:16.031
without giving her any gift
in such a generation?

51:16.531 --> 51:20.577
Or prepare some balloons and flowers
and try again.

51:21.036 --> 51:22.871
I'll help you out.

51:27.042 --> 51:29.628
-Do you remember my name?
-Of course, I remember it.

51:29.711 --> 51:32.798
Because your voice sounded nice
when you introduced yourself.

51:32.881 --> 51:35.342
How about fried chicken
and beer after class?

51:36.885 --> 51:41.223
Well, I'm up for it if Sua is.

51:43.850 --> 51:44.893
How cute.

51:47.312 --> 51:48.146
What?

51:49.022 --> 51:51.024
You cute boy.

51:53.568 --> 51:54.402
Okay?

51:59.533 --> 52:00.492
Okay.

52:01.827 --> 52:03.203
"Okay."

52:06.414 --> 52:09.626
It'll be awesome
if they become a campus couple. Right?

52:10.377 --> 52:11.461
I guess so.

52:13.505 --> 52:15.507
It was a joke.

52:18.385 --> 52:20.679
Thanks for the drink.

52:23.890 --> 52:25.600
Kyung-seok, that...

52:33.650 --> 52:34.484
Sua.

52:35.527 --> 52:38.989
you must be surprised a lot.
There are those strong-headed punks.

52:39.072 --> 52:42.117
If it's uncomfortable, you may go first.
I'll take you home.

52:42.617 --> 52:44.578
No, I'm all right.

52:45.245 --> 52:46.246
Really?

52:47.706 --> 52:50.584
How dare he try to hit on you, seriously?

52:51.877 --> 52:52.794
I can't believe it.

52:53.628 --> 52:57.007
Then again, being pretty
is a headache indeed.

52:57.090 --> 53:01.720
I know. Sua's face looks like
it has been sculpted.

53:02.304 --> 53:04.973
What? I didn't do
any plastic surgery though.

53:08.518 --> 53:10.312
Mi-rae is pretty like a doll.

53:10.937 --> 53:13.315
Her face and body figure.

53:17.861 --> 53:20.155
-Right.
-Mi-rae's pretty.

53:20.238 --> 53:21.198
That's right.

53:22.782 --> 53:24.993
Mi-rae didn't do
any plastic surgery either.

53:36.880 --> 53:39.507
Hey. You think it's funny?

53:41.509 --> 53:42.385
What do you mean?

53:44.554 --> 53:45.597
Is it fun?

53:45.680 --> 53:48.683
You mean, the freshman week party?

53:49.643 --> 53:50.977
Of course, it's fun.

53:51.061 --> 53:54.314
The party?
I'm talking about your ridiculous act.

54:00.195 --> 54:03.198
I don't understand what you're saying.

54:03.281 --> 54:04.991
You're pretending like you don't.

54:15.627 --> 54:17.379
Sua, are you crying?

54:17.462 --> 54:19.673
-Why this punk...
-Don't cry.

54:20.423 --> 54:22.467
-Why are you crying?
-What's wrong with you?

54:22.550 --> 54:24.219
-Apologize right now.
-Apologize.

54:24.970 --> 54:26.054
Kyung-seok!

54:32.269 --> 54:33.311
I'm sorry.

54:34.813 --> 54:36.356
I guess I did something wrong.

54:36.439 --> 54:38.108
You did nothing wrong.

54:38.191 --> 54:39.859
Apologize to her, punk!

54:39.943 --> 54:43.196
Don't cry, Sua.
I guess he's mistaken.

54:48.535 --> 54:49.452
Sua.

54:54.958 --> 54:57.002
Hey, what's wrong with you?

54:58.003 --> 55:00.755
Are you a fool or an idiot?

55:05.427 --> 55:08.221
Why does that jerk behave
so rudely like that?

55:08.346 --> 55:09.973
Let's not swear.

55:10.056 --> 55:11.808
Can't you see the situation?

55:11.933 --> 55:15.186
Are you taking his side because
he's handsome? Stop adding to it!

55:15.270 --> 55:18.231
The girls aren't saying anything
about his terrible manner.

55:18.315 --> 55:20.358
They're crazy about handsome looks.

55:20.442 --> 55:24.946
You're crazy about pretty girls too.
You guys got so hyper when Sua came here.

55:25.030 --> 55:27.532
Are you mad
that you're not a match to Sua?

55:27.615 --> 55:28.450
What?

55:28.533 --> 55:31.661
-Hey, don't bother them.
-Did you talk about me just now?

55:31.745 --> 55:34.372
Girls need to serve military
and fix their attitudes.

55:34.456 --> 55:37.667
Why are you bringing up military?
You haven't even served yet!

55:38.335 --> 55:40.295
-I'm going to!
-Why don't you go now?

55:40.378 --> 55:42.505
Did I enter an elementary school or what?

55:43.131 --> 55:45.050
What's wrong? What happened?

55:45.800 --> 55:48.636
Some girl was putting up a show. See you.

55:49.304 --> 55:50.638
Hey, Kyung-seok!

55:54.726 --> 55:56.561
I need to talk to you for a second.

56:05.445 --> 56:06.780
What's wrong with him?

56:13.912 --> 56:15.080
Sua.

56:22.587 --> 56:24.589
I really didn't know. I'm sorry.

56:25.173 --> 56:27.509
No, it's okay.

56:28.927 --> 56:30.678
I should've told you first.

56:31.596 --> 56:34.099
I know it's hard to tell
that kind of story first.

56:37.769 --> 56:40.063
Why am I so slow-witted?

56:41.022 --> 56:42.899
Sua. Are you okay?

56:52.784 --> 56:55.036
Don't think about running away
like a coward.

56:57.997 --> 57:02.669
The loser will give up on Sua like a man.
Understand?

57:07.549 --> 57:09.092
Do you feel better now?

57:11.928 --> 57:13.138
Yes, thank you.

57:13.888 --> 57:16.683
Don't mention it.
I'm glad you feel better.

57:18.935 --> 57:21.646
By the way, have you thought about it?

57:23.314 --> 57:25.859
About our relationship.

57:28.027 --> 57:31.156
Yes, I've given it some thought,

57:32.407 --> 57:36.828
but I don't think
you and I can be together.

57:37.662 --> 57:38.496
Why?

57:38.621 --> 57:42.459
I think it'll be better for us
to stay as friends.

57:42.542 --> 57:44.002
Why do we have to?

57:44.085 --> 57:48.214
Is it uncomfortable to go out
with a senior? Let's make it a secret.

57:48.798 --> 57:51.759
That's not the reason.

57:52.677 --> 57:53.511
Then what is it?

57:54.429 --> 57:55.722
What's the reason?

57:55.805 --> 57:59.309
You said you liked me too.
Did I misunderstand?

58:00.477 --> 58:02.020
That's not it.

58:04.189 --> 58:05.857
I'm friends with Mi-rae.

58:06.399 --> 58:07.233
What?

58:07.817 --> 58:11.112
How can I go out with my friend's crush?

58:12.238 --> 58:14.240
Sua, that's...

58:14.324 --> 58:15.867
I told you. That's not it.

58:15.950 --> 58:18.036
I'm sorry. I'll go first.

58:18.703 --> 58:21.331
Sua, hold on. Sua.

58:22.040 --> 58:22.957
Sua.

58:24.375 --> 58:25.668
That's not...

58:37.347 --> 58:38.640
Hey, calm down.

58:45.480 --> 58:47.524
It's your turn. Drink it.

58:48.650 --> 58:50.568
Are you giving up because you might lose?

58:52.946 --> 58:55.990
Then give up on Sua.
Don't change words later.

58:56.491 --> 58:59.661
Give up on what?
Is she an object or what?

58:59.744 --> 59:00.662
What did you say?

59:01.246 --> 59:04.123
You got rejected simply because
you were not good enough.

59:04.207 --> 59:07.001
-What, you punk?
-Calm down.

59:08.086 --> 59:09.921
What do you know about Sua?

59:11.339 --> 59:14.676
If you play with Sua, depending on
that handsome face of yours,

59:16.052 --> 59:18.054
I won't let it slide.

59:19.681 --> 59:20.515
Understand?

59:31.150 --> 59:33.736
You're too drunk. Let's hurry and go.

59:35.863 --> 59:37.699
-Can I really go?
-Yes.

59:37.782 --> 59:38.950
It's really fine.

59:40.577 --> 59:42.453
It seems like
it will end soon though.

59:42.537 --> 59:46.541
No, it might last for a long time
this way. You must be tired, so go.

59:46.624 --> 59:47.875
Right, go home.

59:47.959 --> 59:49.002
Still...

59:49.085 --> 59:51.254
-Hurry and go.
-It's okay, so go.

59:55.800 --> 59:57.552
Then I'll go first.

59:57.635 --> 59:59.721
-Okay, bye.
-Bye.

1:00:00.221 --> 1:00:01.264
Bye.

1:00:18.948 --> 1:00:21.075
Do you like me?

1:00:21.618 --> 1:00:22.452
What?

1:00:22.535 --> 1:00:25.288
Do you like me?
Do you want to go out with me?

1:00:25.747 --> 1:00:26.581
No.

1:00:29.083 --> 1:00:32.587
Then did you babble on to Sua
to stab me in the back?

1:00:32.670 --> 1:00:33.588
What?

1:00:33.671 --> 1:00:36.382
She says she can't go out with me
because you like me.

1:00:37.967 --> 1:00:40.928
Who said that?
Because I've never said such a thing.

1:00:41.012 --> 1:00:45.475
Then go tell her directly yourself that
you don't care if she goes out with me.

1:00:46.851 --> 1:00:48.478
Why should I do that?

1:00:48.978 --> 1:00:51.272
Hey, stop right there.

1:00:52.857 --> 1:00:53.983
What are you doing?

1:00:55.360 --> 1:00:56.194
Are you crazy?

1:00:57.528 --> 1:00:59.989
-What did I do?
-What did you do?

1:01:00.365 --> 1:01:01.908
You flirted with me first.

1:01:01.991 --> 1:01:04.285
How dare you act like
you don't know, wench?

1:01:04.369 --> 1:01:07.288
Did you think things would work out
for real?

1:01:07.372 --> 1:01:09.666
People like you are everywhere in Gangnam.

1:01:11.834 --> 1:01:14.045
Gosh, you plastic monster.

1:01:22.345 --> 1:01:26.557
How dare you swear at me?
What did I do so wrong?

1:01:27.100 --> 1:01:29.102
What did I do?

1:01:30.061 --> 1:01:32.021
Why that crazy... Do you want to die?

1:01:32.605 --> 1:01:34.440
That crazy witch. Hey!

1:01:37.443 --> 1:01:39.779
<i>People like you are everywhere in Gangnam.</i>

1:01:40.405 --> 1:01:43.449
<i>Gosh, you plastic monster.</i>

1:01:52.375 --> 1:01:54.836
Hey, gosh.

1:02:24.991 --> 1:02:27.869
Aren't you curious
what Mi-rae looked like in the past?

1:02:27.952 --> 1:02:30.288
Mi-rae and Kyung-seok
went to the same school.

1:02:30.371 --> 1:02:32.749
It's nothing to hide.
Why didn't they tell us?

1:02:32.832 --> 1:02:34.625
Maybe he liked her.

1:02:34.709 --> 1:02:38.045
If I didn't know, why should I ask her
about it when she didn't?

1:02:38.129 --> 1:02:39.756
You don't look that thoughtless.

1:02:39.839 --> 1:02:41.299
He gathered all the freshmen.

1:02:41.382 --> 1:02:44.635
Tell Kyung-seok and Kyung-hee
that their mom wants to see them.

1:02:44.719 --> 1:02:47.138
All the girls can leave
except for Kang Mi-rae.

1:02:48.389 --> 1:02:49.807
Mi-rae.

1:02:49.891 --> 1:02:50.808
Let's go.

1:02:50.892 --> 1:02:52.435
What are you doing right now?
