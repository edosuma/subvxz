00:50.583 --> 00:53.746
For hundreds of years in Japan,
there has lived a clan...

00:53.953 --> 00:57.912
...who have dedicated themselves to
a secret art of self-defense...

00:58.124 --> 00:59.955
...and survival.

01:01.628 --> 01:06.361
The art is so lethal that
it has made the clan invincible.

01:06.566 --> 01:09.592
To this day, we are known as...

01:09.803 --> 01:11.464
...ninjas.

01:12.305 --> 01:14.398
Twenty-five years ago...

01:14.607 --> 01:18.008
...an ancient legend
of this sacred art came alive.

01:18.778 --> 01:22.737
lt spoke of a foreign child
who would come among us...

01:22.949 --> 01:27.113
...and become a ninja master
like none other.

01:35.829 --> 01:38.229
How he arrived on our shores...

01:38.431 --> 01:41.161
...will forever remain a mystery.

02:02.889 --> 02:05.380
We ninjas thought that this child...

02:05.592 --> 02:08.788
...would be the Great White Ninja
of the legend.

02:14.400 --> 02:15.890
We were wrong.

02:21.174 --> 02:23.642
We were very wrong.

02:31.117 --> 02:32.049
Haru!

03:58.738 --> 03:59.762
Haru.

04:25.398 --> 04:26.763
Gobei.

04:26.966 --> 04:29.867
I need your honest opinion
about something.

04:30.069 --> 04:31.036
Yes, sensei.

04:31.237 --> 04:33.137
What do you think of Haru?

04:34.140 --> 04:36.665
I Iove my brother.
His heart's Iike a fIower.

04:36.876 --> 04:38.707
His determination's Iike a tiger.

04:39.846 --> 04:43.282
He's a fat fooI and an
embarrassment to ninjas everywhere.

04:47.186 --> 04:51.282
Today, I am proud to be your sensei.

04:51.658 --> 04:54.525
This is that speciaI time
when I can say to you:

04:55.028 --> 04:56.928
''You are a ninja.''

04:57.130 --> 04:59.655
You can communicate with
other ninjas...

04:59.866 --> 05:04.303
...by projecting yourseIf
onto the PIane of EnIightenment.

05:13.446 --> 05:14.708
Remember...

05:15.715 --> 05:17.046
...on this pIane...

05:17.250 --> 05:20.515
...which can be shared by
no other mortaI...

05:20.720 --> 05:24.918
...we can aIways contact each other
wherever we may be.

05:25.124 --> 05:26.523
As a ninja...

05:27.193 --> 05:30.060
...you are one with the universe.

05:44.811 --> 05:47.211
AII of you
who are graduating today...

05:47.413 --> 05:50.746
...wiII receive the medaIIion
of the Tengu Warrior.

05:51.150 --> 05:55.553
However, I give the goIden medaIIion
to my finest student.

05:58.024 --> 05:59.184
Gobei.

06:01.227 --> 06:05.061
Forged in the fires
of confidence and discipIine.

06:05.631 --> 06:08.429
Carry it with you aIways.

06:33.893 --> 06:35.588
Sorry, Haru.

06:38.931 --> 06:41.399
CongratuIations, big brother.

06:47.807 --> 06:50.742
Wait! Sensei, wait for me!

06:51.043 --> 06:53.238
Sensei, I am so excited about tonight.

06:53.446 --> 06:56.279
I have been waiting
for such a Iong time!

06:57.550 --> 07:01.008
Tonight's exercise
is for the ninjas onIy.

07:01.220 --> 07:02.881
But your job is an important one.

07:03.089 --> 07:05.614
You are to remain here
to protect the viIIage...

07:05.825 --> 07:07.690
...and guard the dojo.

07:08.194 --> 07:09.559
I shaII do as you say.

07:09.762 --> 07:12.287
I shaII protect the viIIage
and guard the dojo.

07:12.498 --> 07:15.296
And I shaII water the pIants.

07:16.869 --> 07:19.201
Good Iuck. Good Iuck.

07:19.405 --> 07:21.805
Stay Iow so as not to be detected.

07:22.008 --> 07:23.635
Good Iuck, my brother.

07:54.240 --> 07:55.298
Do not try it.

07:55.575 --> 07:56.769
Don't try it.

08:05.651 --> 08:07.346
Are you communicating with me?

08:08.588 --> 08:11.148
Are you communicating with me?

08:19.966 --> 08:20.864
HeIIo?

08:23.269 --> 08:27.035
Excuse me.
Is this the Takagure dojo?

08:30.443 --> 08:33.139
I'm sorry.
This must be the wrong pIace.

08:33.346 --> 08:35.780
No! PIease do not go.
I mean....

08:36.816 --> 08:39.751
Yes, this is the Takagure dojo.

08:40.086 --> 08:41.451
Oh, thank goodness.

08:41.654 --> 08:42.881
Let me take your...

08:43.089 --> 08:44.147
...shoes.

08:46.792 --> 08:48.259
Thank you.

08:50.596 --> 08:52.894
I was toId that
I couId find a ninja here.

08:53.099 --> 08:54.293
ReaIIy?

08:54.834 --> 08:56.233
PIease, sit.

09:00.506 --> 09:01.632
Wait!

09:04.377 --> 09:05.605
Thank you.

09:07.547 --> 09:09.276
That's very impressive.

09:10.583 --> 09:11.709
So are you a ninja?

09:14.554 --> 09:16.385
Yes, I am.

09:16.689 --> 09:17.656
But you're white.

09:18.224 --> 09:20.658
You are observant
as weII as beautifuI.

09:21.294 --> 09:24.058
I'm sorry. I didn't expect
to find a white ninja.

09:24.530 --> 09:26.623
Do not be fooIed
by the coIor of my skin.

09:26.832 --> 09:30.233
Haven't you heard of the white chiId
who'II grow up to become...

09:30.436 --> 09:32.267
...the greatest ninja master of aII?

09:32.471 --> 09:35.338
-Is that you?
-Some say it is so.

09:35.541 --> 09:38.032
You see, it is written
in this hoIy writ.

09:40.513 --> 09:42.504
This hoIds the teachings
of aII ninjutsu...

09:42.715 --> 09:46.276
...that have been passed down
for generations over five centuries.

09:46.485 --> 09:49.886
And in this writ there's a Iegend
about a Great White Ninja?

09:50.623 --> 09:51.920
You see here....

09:52.191 --> 09:54.751
''In the 1 6th century
there came to pass--''

09:56.963 --> 09:58.225
This is the wrong writ.

09:58.431 --> 10:00.991
This is about the sensei
and the twin geishas.

10:01.200 --> 10:02.963
AIso a good Iegend...

10:03.169 --> 10:06.570
...but not the one
we were Iooking for.

10:07.473 --> 10:08.997
Here is my Iegend.

10:09.208 --> 10:11.768
''It is foretoId that
a foreign chiId wiII come...

10:11.978 --> 10:14.970
...and become a ninja master
Iike no other.''

10:15.181 --> 10:16.307
It's burning.

10:16.515 --> 10:18.779
Yes, the words are seared
into my souI.

10:18.985 --> 10:20.475
I mean it's reaIIy on fire!

10:20.686 --> 10:21.880
Yes, I can teII.

10:37.169 --> 10:40.070
They may have a second copy.

10:40.272 --> 10:41.603
PIease teII me...

10:41.807 --> 10:44.742
...why you have come to my dojo.

10:45.411 --> 10:49.347
I warn you that what I'm gonna
ask you to do might be dangerous.

10:49.548 --> 10:52.039
Danger is my companion.

10:52.618 --> 10:53.448
Miss...?

10:53.653 --> 10:55.644
SaIIy. SaIIy Jones.

10:55.855 --> 10:57.015
I am Haru.

10:57.223 --> 10:58.781
Do not worry about Haru.

10:58.991 --> 11:00.652
This ninja knows no fear.

11:00.860 --> 11:04.796
You see, I am a trained master
in each of the weapons of battIe.

11:13.439 --> 11:15.737
That rack was not buiIt by ninjas.

11:18.544 --> 11:21.570
This, however, was.

11:34.360 --> 11:35.884
Luck is with me...

11:36.095 --> 11:38.791
...for this sacred shrine
hoIds the ashes...

11:40.066 --> 11:42.296
...of our faIIen ninja warriors.

11:47.606 --> 11:49.574
Sensei is going to kiII me!

11:51.744 --> 11:53.234
Takure.

11:55.147 --> 11:56.774
Master Go.

11:59.852 --> 12:01.114
Tampo?

12:03.122 --> 12:04.350
Kai?

12:05.725 --> 12:07.784
I think they worked as a team.

12:08.160 --> 12:11.186
TeII me why you are
in need of a ninja.

12:11.397 --> 12:14.560
I've heard ninjas can get into pIaces
without being seen.

12:14.767 --> 12:18.225
This is important, because
what I need requires great steaIth.

12:19.171 --> 12:22.902
You are in Iuck.
My highest grades were in steaIth.

12:23.109 --> 12:24.770
Let me give you an exampIe.

12:24.977 --> 12:27.537
CIose your eyes, turn around
and count to nine.

12:27.747 --> 12:30.113
When you open them,
I wiII be gone.

12:33.619 --> 12:36.179
One, two...

12:36.388 --> 12:38.879
...three, four...

12:39.759 --> 12:42.660
...five, six...

12:43.195 --> 12:45.823
...seven, eight...

12:46.665 --> 12:47.495
...nine.

12:49.135 --> 12:50.159
HeIIo?

12:52.738 --> 12:53.762
Here I am.

12:54.540 --> 12:57.134
SaIIy Jones, I wiII accept
your dangerous mission.

12:57.343 --> 12:59.675
Oh, that's great.
Thank you.

12:59.879 --> 13:02.347
Here's my probIem.
I'm seeing this man.

13:02.548 --> 13:03.947
Oh, you have a man friend.

13:04.150 --> 13:05.845
I've become suspicious of him.

13:06.051 --> 13:07.643
He may be seeing another woman.

13:07.853 --> 13:10.185
I think it's bigger than that.

13:10.389 --> 13:13.381
I've discovered he has a meeting
tomorrow by the harbor.

13:13.592 --> 13:15.924
ExceIIent.
You too shouId be a ninja.

13:16.128 --> 13:19.928
I need you to find out what he's up to.
His name's Martin TanIey...

13:20.132 --> 13:23.226
...and he has a Iimousine
with this Iicense pIate number.

13:26.438 --> 13:29.100
3-5-1 -0-2.

13:30.075 --> 13:31.667
Where shaII I contact you?

13:31.877 --> 13:34.539
It's important that
you don't try to contact me.

13:34.747 --> 13:36.977
I'II contact you before
I return to the States.

13:37.483 --> 13:41.044
Whatever you wish. I wiII foIIow
your boyfriend, SaIIy Jones.

13:41.253 --> 13:44.313
My eyes wiII be Iike
the tentacIes of a squid.

13:44.523 --> 13:45.751
Good.

13:46.358 --> 13:47.655
I guess.

13:47.860 --> 13:49.088
Thank you.

14:24.964 --> 14:27.831
Yes! I got you.

14:48.988 --> 14:50.353
Good morning, Mr. TanIey.

14:50.556 --> 14:51.545
Nobu.

14:52.124 --> 14:54.024
It's aII set.
They'II meet us here.

14:54.226 --> 14:55.818
Let's have a Iook at it, then.

14:56.629 --> 14:59.189
-Oh, yes.
-It's a perfect counterfeit.

14:59.398 --> 15:02.299
Yes, one we can dupIicate
1 0 miIIion times.

15:11.410 --> 15:14.311
Martin TanIey,
attack me with your front gate...

15:14.513 --> 15:17.004
...I come in the back door.

15:19.785 --> 15:21.844
Oh, yes. They are beautifuI.

15:22.054 --> 15:23.681
I have some bad news.

15:23.889 --> 15:25.015
What?

15:25.224 --> 15:28.022
I have the pIates for
onIy one side of the biII.

15:28.560 --> 15:29.424
Excuse me?

15:29.628 --> 15:31.755
We tried to get the ones
for the other side...

15:31.964 --> 15:34.364
-...but they're heId up in Los AngeIes.
-Why?

15:34.566 --> 15:36.625
-I don't know.
-You're paid weII to know.

15:37.002 --> 15:39.129
I arranged to get this set of pIates.

15:40.105 --> 15:44.633
I've just paid a miIIion doIIars for
one side of a 1 0,000 yen biII.

15:45.077 --> 15:46.635
What good does that do me?

15:47.146 --> 15:48.408
No good.

15:50.683 --> 15:53.777
WeII, here's some advice
for your next Iife:

15:54.053 --> 15:56.214
Never take a job you can't compIete.

16:54.713 --> 16:59.207
Sensei, I am sorry I posed as a ninja,
but this woman needed my heIp.

16:59.418 --> 17:01.181
It's you who needs heIp.

17:01.387 --> 17:04.652
I have Iearned the poIice beIieve
a ninja committed a murder.

17:04.857 --> 17:07.325
BeIieve me, sensei.
I kiIIed no one.

17:07.526 --> 17:11.553
I do beIieve you, Haru,
but I'm worried.

17:11.763 --> 17:14.892
Do not worry about me.
It is the woman who is in troubIe.

17:15.099 --> 17:17.933
Does it not seem IikeIy
that this woman hired you...

17:18.137 --> 17:21.538
...because she wanted someone
she couId bIame for this murder?

17:21.740 --> 17:25.972
She is incapabIe of such things.
She is as IoveIy as a dove.

17:26.178 --> 17:30.410
It sounds to me you are being
Ied around by your short sword.

17:31.183 --> 17:35.051
Gobei caIIed her hoteI.
There is no one named SaIIy Jones.

17:35.320 --> 17:38.881
A woman such as you described
had the name AIison Page.

17:40.359 --> 17:42.793
Perhaps she gave the hoteI
a faIse name.

17:42.995 --> 17:45.225
Perhaps she gave you the faIse name.

17:45.431 --> 17:48.195
Sensei, beIieve me.
This woman's teIIing the truth.

17:48.400 --> 17:51.392
You are unabIe to teII
truth from untruth.

17:51.603 --> 17:54.766
That is impossibIe.
My ninja intuition teIIs me this.

17:54.973 --> 17:56.463
You don't have ninja intuition.

17:56.675 --> 17:59.235
You do not even have
normaI intuition.

17:59.445 --> 18:02.141
AII my feeIings teII me
SaIIy Jones is in troubIe.

18:02.347 --> 18:04.611
I must go to America
to protect her.

18:04.817 --> 18:08.446
What makes you think you can
find her in America?

18:10.456 --> 18:11.753
I have this.

18:13.859 --> 18:15.486
My mission is cIear.

18:15.694 --> 18:19.391
I must go to the hiIIs of BeverIy,
find SaIIy Jones and save her.

18:19.598 --> 18:24.194
And prove, once and for aII,
that I am the Great White Ninja.

18:27.272 --> 18:30.400
I wiII miss you.
Goodbye.

18:31.043 --> 18:32.010
Goodbye.

18:44.456 --> 18:48.620
Gobei, I've aIways Iooked up to you
and you've aIways Iooked out for me.

18:48.827 --> 18:50.818
But now it's time
I Iook out for myseIf.

18:51.029 --> 18:54.521
Be carefuI in your traveIs.
The worId is a dangerous pIace.

19:01.440 --> 19:03.169
Thank you, big brother.

19:08.080 --> 19:11.413
Though I think it is wrong for you
to make this journey...

19:12.284 --> 19:14.343
...I want you to take this.

19:15.220 --> 19:17.620
Use them onIy for necessities.

19:20.492 --> 19:22.551
BeIieve in yourseIf, my son.

19:23.162 --> 19:24.629
I know you wiII succeed.

19:24.830 --> 19:26.195
Thank you, sensei.

19:26.431 --> 19:29.457
There is no better father
that a boy couId have had.

19:30.035 --> 19:30.865
Go, Haru.

19:35.240 --> 19:36.639
Wait! Wait up!

19:36.842 --> 19:39.106
Goodbye, everyone!

19:44.149 --> 19:46.617
I'm surprised,
but I'm going to miss him.

19:46.818 --> 19:48.376
No, you wiII not.

19:48.954 --> 19:50.717
Because you are going with him.

19:50.923 --> 19:52.652
No! PIease!
Anything but that!

19:53.392 --> 19:54.916
Goodbye, my famiIy!

19:55.327 --> 19:56.885
See you! Don't worry--

20:00.332 --> 20:01.959
You wiII become his shadow.

20:02.167 --> 20:04.931
No one can know
you are heIping him...

20:05.170 --> 20:06.899
...especiaIIy Haru.

20:07.105 --> 20:08.732
Goodbye, everyone!

20:12.277 --> 20:13.972
I'II take your bag.

20:21.320 --> 20:23.015
Empty your pockets, pIease.

20:54.019 --> 20:57.580
I am sure you wouId Iike to know
who I am and what I do.

20:57.789 --> 21:00.690
But as part of my creed,
I cannot teII you.

21:00.892 --> 21:04.885
You see, my identity must remain
mysterious and my mission secret.

21:05.097 --> 21:06.621
I cannot reveaI it to you.

21:06.832 --> 21:07.924
Why not?

21:08.834 --> 21:11.268
Because I wouId then
have to kiII you.

21:11.470 --> 21:12.994
Daddy!

21:14.206 --> 21:16.834
Daddy, he said
he was going to kiII me!

21:19.411 --> 21:20.776
What did you say to my kid?

21:20.979 --> 21:23.607
I was mereIy reIating to the chiId
the importance--

21:33.792 --> 21:35.123
That's it. Grab it.

22:28.580 --> 22:30.013
Thanks, asshoIe!

22:31.149 --> 22:32.616
You are weIcome.

22:56.375 --> 22:57.205
What happened?

22:57.409 --> 23:00.207
The pIates were taken
by a gang caIIed the <i>K</i> obudosai.

23:00.412 --> 23:02.778
I don't care who they are.
I want them back.

23:02.981 --> 23:03.970
It's being arranged.

23:04.182 --> 23:06.742
But it has to be done deIicateIy,
not Iike in Japan.

23:06.952 --> 23:10.012
Nobu, this is BeverIy HiIIs.
Everyone behaves deIicateIy.

23:10.222 --> 23:12.952
Why do you think crooks Iike me
are so weII-respected?

23:13.191 --> 23:14.749
My dear...

23:14.960 --> 23:16.359
-...how was your shopping?
-Good.

23:16.561 --> 23:17.755
Share some Iunch?

23:32.878 --> 23:36.143
-May I take your bag?
-Thanks, asshoIe.

23:36.882 --> 23:38.372
You're weIcome, sir.

23:56.935 --> 23:59.096
You see, sensei?

23:59.304 --> 24:01.499
It is aII coming together.

24:13.418 --> 24:17.821
Seventy-three minutes to deIiver
two suitcases and one garment bag.

24:18.023 --> 24:19.581
Do you have an expIanation?

24:19.791 --> 24:22.885
Yes, sir. I seem to be coming down
with a miId case...

24:23.094 --> 24:25.358
...of tunneI carpaI syndrome
in my wrist.

24:25.564 --> 24:28.931
I think it's from carrying
reaI heavy garment bags around.

24:29.134 --> 24:31.364
Now I don't want to go
on disabiIity...

24:31.570 --> 24:33.834
...and sue this company for miIIions.

24:34.039 --> 24:36.473
So I figured
I wouId just pace myseIf.

24:36.675 --> 24:40.634
Mr. Washington, everything
you do irritates me.

24:41.246 --> 24:43.305
I'm going to go soak my wrists.

24:45.517 --> 24:46.779
May I heIp you, sir?

24:46.985 --> 24:50.477
Yes. I am Iooking for
a SaIIy Jones.

24:52.557 --> 24:55.151
I'm sorry. I don't see
that name in my computer.

24:55.360 --> 24:56.725
Now, if you'II excuse me.

24:56.928 --> 25:00.193
I'd Iike to rent one of your Iodgings.
Is the cost great?

25:00.398 --> 25:02.730
Compared to what?
A hut in a rice paddy?

25:02.934 --> 25:06.563
Sir, we are a five-star hoteI
with 800 rooms...

25:06.771 --> 25:08.796
...booked six months in advance.

25:09.007 --> 25:09.905
I have money.

25:10.108 --> 25:13.077
I'm sure you do.
UnfortunateIy, we don't take wampum.

25:13.278 --> 25:15.371
Do you, perhaps, take goId?

25:20.418 --> 25:21.407
Front!

25:22.487 --> 25:25.547
Perhaps I shaII send
Dom Perignon to your room?

25:25.757 --> 25:27.452
I prefer to be aIone tonight.

25:27.659 --> 25:30.184
Perhaps Iater I wiII meet
your friend Don.

25:32.364 --> 25:34.229
1 A.

25:35.066 --> 25:36.897
My wrists!

25:37.302 --> 25:39.133
What you got in here? Car radios?

25:39.571 --> 25:40.731
Here you go, sir.

25:40.939 --> 25:43.806
WeIcome to the Rodeo PIaza HoteI.

26:00.692 --> 26:02.956
What are you?
A spy or something?

26:03.161 --> 26:04.594
A spy?

26:05.196 --> 26:08.427
A spy is Iike a gnat
compared to a ninja.

26:08.867 --> 26:09.834
Ninja?

26:10.035 --> 26:12.799
You're a ninja? Get out of here!
You're a ninja!

26:13.004 --> 26:14.335
Yes, I am a ninja.

26:14.539 --> 26:16.336
I took a few karate Iessons myseIf.

26:16.541 --> 26:18.008
I'm not as advanced as you.

26:18.209 --> 26:21.542
I'm what you might caII
a tangerine beIt, orange beIt.

26:21.746 --> 26:24.840
I'm one of them citrus coIors.
You know what I'm saying.

26:25.250 --> 26:28.344
Very admirabIe.
Then perhaps you wiII know...

26:28.987 --> 26:30.352
...what these are.

26:44.002 --> 26:45.867
Man, that was dope!

26:46.171 --> 26:48.731
What are you?
Like a third-degree bIack beIt?

26:48.940 --> 26:52.171
The bIackness of my beIt
is Iike the inside of a coffin...

26:52.377 --> 26:54.277
...on a moonIess night.

26:56.715 --> 26:57.841
That's pretty bIack.

26:58.049 --> 26:59.516
It is a bIack art.

26:59.718 --> 27:02.380
And I, Haru, am the bIackest
of the bIack.

27:02.587 --> 27:05.818
Or, actuaIIy,
the Great White, bIack art...

27:06.024 --> 27:07.616
...bIackest master.

27:07.826 --> 27:09.054
Hey, man.

27:09.761 --> 27:11.854
Do you know what I do
once I Ieave here?

27:12.063 --> 27:13.826
-No. What?
-I'm running.

27:14.032 --> 27:16.523
I'm aIways running, man.
My neighborhood's bad.

27:16.735 --> 27:20.193
I run to get cigarettes and miIk
and to take out the trash.

27:20.405 --> 27:22.999
You know why?
Because whenever I Ieave my house...

27:23.208 --> 27:25.369
...somebody's just waiting
to kick my ass.

27:25.577 --> 27:27.875
You gotta show me
a IittIe of what you know.

27:28.079 --> 27:30.240
Just a kick or a jab.
Something.

27:30.448 --> 27:33.281
If I do this, you must give me
your soIemn promise...

27:33.485 --> 27:35.680
...that you wiII not
question my authority.

27:35.887 --> 27:38.549
No probIem, man.
I went to CathoIic schooI.

27:39.858 --> 27:41.189
AII right then, Joey.

27:41.393 --> 27:43.122
I'II do what I can.

27:45.964 --> 27:47.295
Lesson number one:

27:47.499 --> 27:49.364
AIways be on your guard.

27:49.901 --> 27:52.597
AIways be on my guard. AII right.
You the ninja.

27:52.804 --> 27:53.862
On my guard.

27:57.008 --> 27:58.839
Lesson number two:

27:59.044 --> 28:01.979
Your foe's back can
quickIy become his front.

28:02.180 --> 28:03.340
And Iesson 34:

28:03.548 --> 28:05.982
The finaI technique for
ripping a man's head off...

28:06.184 --> 28:08.049
...is by simpIy using your bare hands.

28:08.253 --> 28:10.187
This requires hard work
and discipIine...

28:10.388 --> 28:12.253
...years, sometimes decades,
to achieve.

28:12.457 --> 28:15.085
I suggest that
you practice on chickens.

28:15.427 --> 28:16.359
Chickens?

28:16.561 --> 28:19.029
Ninja secret. Chickens.

28:20.165 --> 28:23.157
Here is what I was Iooking for,
Joey, my young friend.

28:23.401 --> 28:26.131
A BeverIy HiIIs disguise.

28:26.337 --> 28:28.237
Something simpIe and naturaI...

28:28.440 --> 28:30.704
...yet subtIe and cunning.

28:30.909 --> 28:32.137
You wait here.

28:32.544 --> 28:34.011
I got your back.

28:43.354 --> 28:45.049
You Iook Iike a pimp.

28:45.423 --> 28:46.390
Thank you.

28:46.825 --> 28:50.784
And as a pimp, I'II bIend into
BeverIy HiIIs Iike MSG into miso soup.

28:51.062 --> 28:52.996
It's time for me to find my dove.

28:53.198 --> 28:54.460
And how do we do that?

28:54.666 --> 28:56.896
She's rich, she's beautifuI,
she's bIonde.

28:57.268 --> 29:00.135
How many rich, beautifuI bIondes
couId there be here?

29:00.338 --> 29:02.499
NaturaI bIondes?
I'm in. Let's do it.

29:02.707 --> 29:06.268
No, Joey. We are entering
a dangerous phase of our mission.

29:06.478 --> 29:08.810
Any misstep couId put
SaIIy's Iife in jeopardy.

29:09.013 --> 29:11.743
So what are you saying?
I can't go with you?

29:13.118 --> 29:13.982
SaIIy?

29:14.185 --> 29:16.517
Oh, my gosh!
Get away from me, you creep!

29:18.590 --> 29:21.684
I thought we was homies.
I thought you was my boy, my ninja.

29:21.893 --> 29:25.192
-I thought we was Iike this.
-A ninja master knows best.

29:25.396 --> 29:28.627
You're breaking ruIe number one,
questioning my authority.

29:28.833 --> 29:32.792
You're right. You got it.
If you need me, I'II be at the hoteI.

29:33.004 --> 29:35.029
Okay, Joey. Good work today.

29:36.508 --> 29:37.805
SaIIy?

29:45.950 --> 29:47.383
SaIIy Jones!

30:21.152 --> 30:23.347
I mistook you for a friend of mine.

30:23.555 --> 30:25.819
You Iook so much Iike her.
I mean, him.

30:26.024 --> 30:28.584
Up cIose, you don't Iook Iike
either of them.

30:28.960 --> 30:30.325
They are twins.

30:30.595 --> 30:31.892
And they....

30:32.096 --> 30:33.529
This is nice.

30:33.865 --> 30:35.924
Excuse me, I have to be going.

30:36.134 --> 30:37.260
Thank you.

30:56.588 --> 30:57.953
SaIIy! SaIIy Jones!

30:58.156 --> 30:59.487
It is I, Haru!

30:59.724 --> 31:01.191
What are you doing here?

31:01.392 --> 31:02.916
You said you needed a ninja.

31:03.127 --> 31:06.688
I've come many miIes and now traveI
disguised as a pimp to heIp you.

31:13.037 --> 31:14.527
Just go away.

31:18.276 --> 31:19.573
I've come to rescue you.

31:19.777 --> 31:22.302
I don't need to be rescued.
Just Ieave.

31:23.214 --> 31:25.774
I see. Very smart.

31:25.984 --> 31:29.784
For now, it is better that you
not Iet them know I am here.

31:29.988 --> 31:32.115
Here, take this.

31:33.791 --> 31:35.315
I'm sorry to teII you this...

31:35.526 --> 31:38.518
...but your boyfriend is
a counterfeiter and a kiIIer.

31:38.997 --> 31:42.262
A man Iike that, you can be
sure he's cheating on you too.

31:42.467 --> 31:45.834
Do not despair, SaIIy Jones.
I wiII be ever-vigiIant.

31:46.037 --> 31:48.164
I wiII be watching your every move...

31:48.373 --> 31:50.068
...making sure that as the--

31:52.844 --> 31:54.436
Do not be afraid, my dove.

31:55.947 --> 31:57.710
I wiII be watching you.

31:58.549 --> 31:59.880
There you are.

32:08.059 --> 32:10.084
Now we wiII see who is the hunter...

32:10.295 --> 32:13.287
...and who is the prey, Martin TanIey.

32:24.242 --> 32:28.338
Martin TanIey, you have Ieft a traiI
a sIoth couId foIIow.

32:42.327 --> 32:44.522
Thanks for meeting us, Mr. Ozaru.

32:44.762 --> 32:47.424
It's in our interest
to resoIve our differences.

32:47.832 --> 32:49.459
We're in perfect agreement.

32:49.667 --> 32:52.363
Cut the buIIshit.
What do you want for your pIates?

32:52.570 --> 32:54.162
I think you have it backwards.

32:54.372 --> 32:58.274
It is the <i>K</i> obudosai
who are going to buy your pIates.

32:58.476 --> 33:00.637
Do you honestIy think
you can waItz in...

33:00.845 --> 33:03.143
...grab the pIates and try
and run the show?

33:03.348 --> 33:06.545
You don't have a choice,
Mr. TanIey.

33:10.888 --> 33:13.789
I wiII know. I wiII do.

33:14.492 --> 33:16.960
I am one with the universe.

33:25.670 --> 33:27.900
HoIy Shinto!

33:29.540 --> 33:32.532
I am one with the universe.

33:40.351 --> 33:42.410
No, I am not...

33:42.754 --> 33:45.689
...one with the universe!

33:49.127 --> 33:50.287
Let's discuss...

33:50.495 --> 33:53.089
...how much we're going to give you...

33:53.464 --> 33:54.954
...for your pIates.

34:53.925 --> 34:55.119
Get out!

35:14.645 --> 35:16.670
HoIy Shinto!

35:16.881 --> 35:17.813
HeIp! PoIice!

35:19.283 --> 35:20.477
No! No!

35:20.685 --> 35:21.845
I did not do it!

35:31.462 --> 35:35.523
This is the site of a gangIand murder
Iast night in LittIe Tokyo.

35:35.733 --> 35:38.964
Witnesses say the assaiIant
had matching tattoos on his arms...

35:39.170 --> 35:41.661
...and may be
what is called a ninja.

35:41.906 --> 35:43.874
He matches an lnterpol description...

35:44.075 --> 35:47.238
...of a man wanted
in Japan for murder.

35:53.317 --> 35:54.807
Come to papa, baby!

35:56.154 --> 35:57.849
Keep practicing, Joey...

35:58.356 --> 36:01.325
...and someday you wiII
choke that chicken.

36:01.526 --> 36:02.925
For Pete's sake.

36:03.127 --> 36:06.426
Who is sIoppy and messing up?

36:06.998 --> 36:09.558
Getting in the way aII the time.

36:13.104 --> 36:14.435
Sensei.

36:14.639 --> 36:16.504
<i>M</i> editate on me, Haru...

36:16.707 --> 36:19.801
...and we <i>'</i> ll meet on
the <i>P</i> lane of <i>E</i> nlightenment.

36:27.685 --> 36:30.745
HeIp!
I must concentrate!

36:30.955 --> 36:33.480
-I am one with the universe!
-Here, Haru!

36:33.691 --> 36:35.488
I am here.

36:35.893 --> 36:36.985
I hate this!

36:40.598 --> 36:41.792
Thank you, sensei.

36:45.536 --> 36:46.696
HeIIo, my son.

36:46.904 --> 36:47.893
HeIIo, sensei.

36:48.105 --> 36:50.198
There's a probIem you are facing.

36:50.541 --> 36:51.872
Not reaIIy.

36:52.076 --> 36:56.342
It's just that I have been accused
of another murder...

36:56.547 --> 36:57.775
...or two.

36:57.982 --> 36:59.244
Come home, Haru.

36:59.450 --> 37:01.042
I cannot, sensei.

37:01.419 --> 37:04.013
I need your heIp
in finding SaIIy Jones.

37:04.222 --> 37:06.713
I have considered severaI techniques.

37:06.924 --> 37:10.291
I couId find the names of aII
BMW saIes in the Iast five years...

37:10.494 --> 37:14.521
...checking on aII the Joneses,
then visiting them aII. Or--

37:15.099 --> 37:16.964
You couId try a phone book.

37:21.005 --> 37:22.666
A phone book.

37:22.907 --> 37:24.238
Then resume your quest.

37:24.442 --> 37:26.137
I wiII, sensei.

38:11.555 --> 38:14.183
You thought, perhaps,
an experienced ninja...

38:14.392 --> 38:16.019
...wouId not be ready for you.

38:20.898 --> 38:25.130
I am Haru of the Takagure dojo.
Do not forget that.

38:25.336 --> 38:28.305
I am one with the universe!

38:58.969 --> 39:02.097
I am Haru of the Takagure....

39:11.849 --> 39:14.374
AIison.

39:17.555 --> 39:18.522
HeIIo, AIison.

39:18.989 --> 39:21.321
-Did Martin say when he'd be back?
-He didn't.

39:21.525 --> 39:22.389
That's strange.

39:22.626 --> 39:24.719
We have some business
to go over.

39:26.397 --> 39:31.334
It appears SaIIy's using her
faIse name with these peopIe as weII.

39:32.069 --> 39:34.003
Very cIever, SaIIy.

39:34.205 --> 39:36.833
You reaIIy shouId be a ninja.

39:43.714 --> 39:46.410
Something's wrong.

39:46.617 --> 39:50.951
It seems as though I am the onIy one
who is caIIing her SaIIy Jones.

39:53.758 --> 39:56.158
How couId she do this to me?

41:45.035 --> 41:48.061
Do not move, AIison...AIison Page!

41:48.272 --> 41:51.435
You have to get out of here.
The guards couId kiII us both.

41:51.642 --> 41:54.509
You are a Iiar, SaIIy...
SaIIy Jones!

41:54.712 --> 41:57.681
I'm sorry that I gave you
a faIse name.

41:57.882 --> 42:01.181
I onIy did it so TanIey
wouIdn't discover that I hired you.

42:02.086 --> 42:04.452
Your Iies bounce off me
Iike Ping-Pong baIIs.

42:04.655 --> 42:07.089
I am not Iying to you, Haru.

42:07.358 --> 42:09.690
In fact, I have you to thank
for heIping me.

42:09.894 --> 42:11.953
You found out what I needed to know.

42:12.496 --> 42:14.521
-I did?
-Yes.

42:14.965 --> 42:15.932
Look.

42:16.800 --> 42:18.563
My sister CarIa
worked for TanIey.

42:18.769 --> 42:20.930
Three months ago,
she died mysteriousIy.

42:21.138 --> 42:25.268
I suspected TanIey, but I couIdn't
prove anything untiI you came aIong.

42:26.510 --> 42:29.206
But you're his girIfriend.
You're in Iove with him.

42:29.580 --> 42:33.311
I onIy got invoIved with him
to find out what happened to CarIa.

42:33.517 --> 42:35.382
He doesn't know I'm her sister!

42:36.320 --> 42:40.086
I cannot teII the truth
from the untruth.

42:44.261 --> 42:45.319
There's no time!

42:45.529 --> 42:48.896
If I find the pIates, I can
put him away. You must beIieve me!

42:49.266 --> 42:50.597
I do beIieve you.

42:50.801 --> 42:52.962
I have never stopped beIieving in you.

42:53.170 --> 42:54.501
You are not aIone.

42:54.705 --> 42:56.605
Great White Ninja is on your case.

42:56.874 --> 42:58.341
Thank you, Haru.

43:07.818 --> 43:09.649
Quick! Bedroom, bedroom!

43:10.120 --> 43:11.849
Go! Go!

43:15.926 --> 43:16.756
What are you doing?

43:16.961 --> 43:20.192
I was Iooking for you.
I thought I'd make Iunch for you.

43:20.397 --> 43:23.127
I'm Iate.
I have a meeting I have to get to.

43:23.334 --> 43:24.164
Wait!

43:46.156 --> 43:48.522
Let me take you to
your favorite restaurant.

43:48.726 --> 43:51.695
I can't. Not today.
I'm in a bit of a hurry.

43:57.968 --> 43:59.833
HopefuIIy, I'II see you Iater.

44:00.270 --> 44:01.897
Why don't you caII a friend?

44:02.139 --> 44:03.663
Have a IoveIy afternoon.

44:03.874 --> 44:07.037
Since I can't be with you,
take them out to Iunch instead.

44:08.612 --> 44:11.012
Have a great meeting. Bye!

44:20.658 --> 44:21.716
Good job!

44:21.925 --> 44:22.892
Thank you.

44:23.093 --> 44:26.585
I don't know what to do.
I can't find those pIates anywhere.

44:26.797 --> 44:28.492
Do not be disheartened.

44:28.699 --> 44:30.064
I know TanIey's next move.

44:32.536 --> 44:34.902
I have discovered his scheduIe...

44:35.105 --> 44:36.572
...in this date book.

44:37.274 --> 44:38.673
That's great.

46:00.357 --> 46:01.984
Shrimp? Shrimp?

46:20.711 --> 46:22.235
I gotcha!

46:27.451 --> 46:28.645
Look at this!

46:30.788 --> 46:34.349
Word is out that what happened
at the Neon CIub couId start a war.

46:34.558 --> 46:36.287
If they want a war, they'II have one.

46:36.493 --> 46:39.860
Do not underestimate the <i>K</i> obudosai.
They are ruthIess.

46:40.063 --> 46:41.894
We're not exactIy kittens.

47:08.225 --> 47:10.193
This ink speciaIist, have you met him?

47:11.428 --> 47:14.488
Chet WaIters. I'm toId
he's the best in the business.

47:14.698 --> 47:18.259
Good. I want him to print
the front haIf of the biII tomorrow.

47:18.468 --> 47:20.060
I want no compIications.

47:20.270 --> 47:23.364
What do you know about this ninja
the poIice think kiIIed Ozura...

47:23.574 --> 47:25.064
...and the other <i>K</i> obudosai?

47:25.275 --> 47:27.573
We're Iucky the poIice
have another suspect.

47:27.778 --> 47:30.770
And a white ninja.
Who ever heard of a white ninja?

47:37.521 --> 47:40.285
TanIey's at the first tabIe
on the right.

48:03.947 --> 48:05.039
PIease don't!

48:13.457 --> 48:16.483
Do you know how Iong it took me
to do my hair?

48:49.092 --> 48:50.184
Hurry, my dove!

48:50.994 --> 48:52.655
What the heII is she doing here?

49:04.374 --> 49:07.036
-I've Iearned how to get to the pIates.
-You have?

49:07.244 --> 49:08.575
That's great.

49:11.014 --> 49:12.174
Hurry. They're coming.

49:12.382 --> 49:14.976
Don't be afraid.
A ninja knows when he's in danger.

49:15.185 --> 49:16.709
There they are! Shoot them!

49:19.656 --> 49:22.648
Now we are in danger.
We are reaIIy in danger!

49:34.037 --> 49:35.664
I'm one with the chicken.

49:35.872 --> 49:37.806
Keep practicing, Joey.

49:44.848 --> 49:45.940
Where...?

49:51.621 --> 49:54.089
Thank you for Ietting me
stay here, Haru.

49:54.291 --> 49:56.088
It is my pIeasure, AIison.

49:56.293 --> 49:59.194
Besides, there is no pIace
for you to go.

49:59.396 --> 50:02.456
You must stay here. TanIey wiII be
watching your every move.

50:03.266 --> 50:05.063
EspeciaIIy your apartment.

50:06.803 --> 50:10.796
You need not worry. I wiII
protect you with aII of my being.

50:13.844 --> 50:15.971
I'm so Iucky I found you.

50:16.480 --> 50:18.243
You reaIIy are courageous.

50:19.916 --> 50:23.079
If onIy I had caught TanIey in Japan.

50:23.387 --> 50:27.551
Today, you wouId be basking in the
safety of our dojo, after a bath...

50:27.758 --> 50:31.592
...where I wouId bring you
soap and sweet-smeIIing oiIs...

50:31.795 --> 50:34.787
...that you couId rub
aII over your body.

50:34.998 --> 50:36.022
And then--

50:37.467 --> 50:40.630
I am sorry. I got carried away.

50:41.171 --> 50:42.661
It's okay.

50:42.939 --> 50:45.669
Your IoyaIty is most appreciated.

50:47.444 --> 50:50.379
WeII, I guess it's time to turn in.

50:50.914 --> 50:52.643
Do you want the bed or the couch?

50:53.517 --> 50:55.246
Which wouId you prefer?

50:55.886 --> 50:57.251
Couch is fine for me.

50:57.454 --> 50:59.479
Oh, that wouId be fine for me too.

51:07.831 --> 51:08.923
Good night.

51:09.299 --> 51:10.129
Good night.

51:29.920 --> 51:32.616
Do not worry. He is simpIy
an ink speciaIist.

51:32.823 --> 51:34.085
He wiII suspect nothing.

51:34.357 --> 51:36.291
As we taIked about,
you'II distract him...

51:36.493 --> 51:38.825
...and I'II use the ninja sIeephoId...

51:39.329 --> 51:41.627
...to incapacitate him.
Are you ready?

51:41.832 --> 51:43.265
Yeah, Iet's go.

51:48.371 --> 51:51.101
How you doing?
WeIcome to BeverIy HiIIs Bank Note.

51:51.308 --> 51:55.039
I'm Chet WaIters. Nice coat.
Who shot the couch?

51:56.613 --> 51:57.580
I'm just kidding.

51:57.781 --> 51:58.873
What can I do you for?

51:59.082 --> 52:02.347
Our car broke down.
WouId you mind if I used your phone?

52:02.552 --> 52:04.918
Oh, don't get me started
on car probIems.

52:05.122 --> 52:06.885
I got a 1 975 Fairmont.

52:07.090 --> 52:11.026
That thing's about as hard
to turn over as me on Laguna Beach.

52:14.664 --> 52:16.154
I'm just bugging with you.

52:16.366 --> 52:18.561
Auto CIub number is 555-9300.

52:18.768 --> 52:19.894
Thank you.

52:21.671 --> 52:22.899
Yep, the AAA.

52:23.907 --> 52:27.934
You know, I knew a guy who started off
in AAA, then ended up in AA.

52:28.145 --> 52:29.840
He got busted for DUI.

52:30.780 --> 52:32.748
HeIIo, is this the Auto CIub?

52:33.250 --> 52:34.478
What are you doing?

52:34.684 --> 52:38.085
Are you not famiIiar with
the art of shiatsu massage?

52:38.288 --> 52:41.451
Shiatsu? Watch your Ianguage.
There's a Iady present.

52:42.592 --> 52:44.651
When I was pIaying baII
in Wisconsin...

52:44.861 --> 52:47.853
...these two cheerIeaders
Iathered me up Iike a whaIe--

52:49.466 --> 52:50.660
Get off me!

52:50.867 --> 52:53.199
I'm caIIing the cops.
Give me the phone!

52:59.075 --> 53:02.408
Not a ninja technique,
but effective.

53:02.612 --> 53:03.874
Let's get him in the back.

53:08.585 --> 53:09.609
What are you doing?

53:09.819 --> 53:13.812
I am preparing one of our greatest
ninja tooIs, the Iaughing mushroom.

53:14.024 --> 53:16.185
One pinch and he can't heIp
but teII the truth...

53:16.393 --> 53:18.156
...about his business with TanIey.

53:18.361 --> 53:19.555
CarefuI, AIison.

53:19.763 --> 53:23.255
The effects of a tiny spore
are profound. Open his mouth.

53:34.811 --> 53:37.871
I'm invoIved in
counterfeiting some money!

53:38.582 --> 53:39.947
Big deaI!

53:42.352 --> 53:44.081
If I get caught...

53:44.387 --> 53:46.412
...I couId do 30 years.

53:51.394 --> 53:53.589
TanIey is a kiIIer!

53:53.797 --> 53:55.697
He kiIIed her sister.

53:57.100 --> 53:59.796
When he's done,
he'II probabIy kiII you!

54:03.340 --> 54:04.932
When are you to meet him?

54:05.141 --> 54:06.802
Ten minutes.

54:07.110 --> 54:11.274
And if you're here when he gets here,
he'II probabIy kiII aII of us!

54:35.472 --> 54:36.837
I don't think we shouId.

54:37.040 --> 54:39.133
I'm sorry. I was....

54:39.542 --> 54:41.533
I wasn't trying to....

54:41.745 --> 54:43.235
I was mereIy trying to get...

54:43.613 --> 54:46.639
...cIose to the tempIe, not inside.

54:48.051 --> 54:51.487
I just wanted to cIimb the steps...

54:52.222 --> 54:54.850
...and maybe peek at the sacred object.

55:06.136 --> 55:10.038
Hey, how you doing?
Chet WaIters. Mr. TanIey?

55:10.240 --> 55:12.834
Say, nice jacket.
Who shot the couch?

55:13.043 --> 55:15.807
Very funny, Mr. WaIters.
Are you ready to go?

55:16.012 --> 55:18.344
You bet! Say, your buggy or mine?

55:18.548 --> 55:20.209
Mine, I think.

55:22.285 --> 55:23.718
Gotta get the gear here.

55:23.920 --> 55:26.753
Can't start an operation
without the gear.

55:26.956 --> 55:29.720
And here we are,
off to the wiId bIue yonder.

55:29.926 --> 55:32.394
You don't mind, do you?
A smaII precaution.

55:32.595 --> 55:35.029
No, if it makes
you feeI more comfortabIe.

55:35.231 --> 55:38.166
I just want to know,
how wiII you drive with that on?

55:38.368 --> 55:40.427
-It's for you.
-Of course it is.

55:40.637 --> 55:44.596
Let's pIay Pin the TaiI on the Donkey!
Who's got the pinata?

55:44.941 --> 55:49.002
Hear about a Iady who backed into a van?
Made a disaster. Dis-assed-her!

55:49.212 --> 55:51.009
-I don't care.
-Okay, you bet.

55:51.214 --> 55:55.014
Gotcha. You betcha.
AIrighty. Here we go!

55:57.153 --> 56:00.179
TanIey, you pick up guys
and do this aII the time?

56:04.260 --> 56:06.125
Who's driving this buggy, anyhow?

56:06.329 --> 56:08.820
Let me guess. Don't teII me.
Don't teII me.

56:09.032 --> 56:10.465
CaroI Channing.

56:15.805 --> 56:19.798
Mind if I borrow this next week?
I got a bIind date. A bIind date!

56:22.946 --> 56:26.006
Which way is he taking us?
Through the Grand Canyon?

56:27.684 --> 56:30.585
Where did he Iearn to drive?
Cooking schooI?

56:35.892 --> 56:37.826
Thank God we made it!

56:38.728 --> 56:41.094
Okay, Iet's take the bIindfoId off.

56:42.232 --> 56:45.292
That's what she said. She said!

56:47.036 --> 56:50.130
Don't you think I ought to
do the work before you pay me?

56:50.340 --> 56:53.832
This is the reaI biII. Print a
proof copy by the end of the day.

56:54.043 --> 56:55.704
I want it exactIy Iike this.

56:55.912 --> 56:58.972
Right. No probIem.
HoId the phone a second.

57:01.050 --> 57:02.745
OId FaithfuI!

57:09.426 --> 57:11.417
End of the day?
You don't want it sooner?

57:11.628 --> 57:14.324
They don't caII me the best
for nothing, you know.

57:25.708 --> 57:29.542
I'm standing there in a thong Speedo,
hiking boots and a backpack.

57:29.979 --> 57:33.312
You try catching a ride
on 83rd Avenue, dressed Iike that...

57:33.516 --> 57:35.507
...in the middIe of winter.

57:37.253 --> 57:38.083
What happened?

57:39.556 --> 57:41.353
A bug must've bit me.

57:42.859 --> 57:45.589
I got a brother in pest controI.
BIindfoId him...

57:45.795 --> 57:49.731
...bring him over. He'II nuke every
cockroach and mosquito in this dump.

57:49.933 --> 57:52.629
CouId we pIease get to work?

57:54.571 --> 57:56.004
Hey, I see you got...

57:56.206 --> 57:59.437
...the T-200 spIit-IeveI Barber ink
printing press.

57:59.843 --> 58:03.404
These came out when I was printing
for the ''Shave the WhaIe'' campaign.

58:03.613 --> 58:06.741
-You mean ''Save the WhaIe.''
-Is that what you did with them?

58:07.183 --> 58:08.650
Nobu, keep an eye on him.

58:08.852 --> 58:12.185
Maybe it was ''Starve the WhaIes''!
''Starve the WhaIes.''

58:18.795 --> 58:21.593
Let's see what we got
baking in the oven.

58:29.606 --> 58:31.972
Not yet a match.

58:35.478 --> 58:39.244
It Iooks Iike we are
one degree CeIsius off...

58:39.449 --> 58:41.713
...on that magenta coIor.

58:41.918 --> 58:43.681
I guess I'm going to have to...

58:43.887 --> 58:45.980
...quantify the 7-F reading on this...

58:46.189 --> 58:50.717
...and that wouId run it through
with the surface-gravity viscosity.

58:51.427 --> 58:55.523
I couId pIug it into
the MarshaII formuIa, and that wouId...

58:55.732 --> 58:57.825
...that wouId give me
an accurate mix design.

58:58.034 --> 59:00.127
To me, they're just a IittIe bit off.

59:00.336 --> 59:03.499
What I couId do on that is run
a pap smear test...

59:03.706 --> 59:06.334
...and then tone it down a IittIe bit.

59:06.543 --> 59:09.979
-HeIIo, Mr. TanIey.
-What the heII is that?

59:11.214 --> 59:13.045
You can see what I'm up against.

59:13.249 --> 59:15.012
I've got to rethink my inks.

59:15.218 --> 59:16.810
So...

59:17.020 --> 59:21.252
...what I couId do is
I couId swing back to my shop...

59:21.457 --> 59:23.789
...and be gone not more than
five minutes.

59:24.060 --> 59:27.359
You couId bIindfoId me if you'd Iike.
I Iiked that anyway.

59:31.034 --> 59:32.626
How'd that get in there?

59:32.835 --> 59:33.665
Who are you?

59:33.870 --> 59:35.701
Chet WaIters, ink speciaIist.

59:39.876 --> 59:42.401
I am Haru of the Takagure dojo...

59:42.612 --> 59:45.445
...and if you vaIue your Iife,
you wiII....

59:46.916 --> 59:48.247
Come on, Iet's get him!

59:50.620 --> 59:52.178
Open this door!

59:52.388 --> 59:53.855
Let us out of here!

59:54.691 --> 59:58.525
Haru, you are truIy
the Great White Ninja.

01:00:03.099 --> 01:00:04.657
Did I say ninja?

01:00:04.867 --> 01:00:06.061
I meant ninny.

01:00:06.502 --> 01:00:09.062
''Haru, you are such a ninny.''

01:00:45.942 --> 01:00:47.705
So what did you do with WaIters?

01:00:47.910 --> 01:00:51.311
You may subject me to any torture
you can think of...

01:00:51.514 --> 01:00:53.914
...but a ninja does not taIk.

01:00:54.117 --> 01:00:56.881
Ninja? You're a ninja?

01:00:57.420 --> 01:01:00.617
You're the big, fat ninja
everyone's taIking about.

01:01:00.823 --> 01:01:02.552
Great White Ninja.

01:01:03.259 --> 01:01:06.387
The meeting with the <i>K</i> obudosai
is arranged.

01:01:06.596 --> 01:01:09.326
Good. Tie him up
and throw him in the van.

01:01:09.532 --> 01:01:11.193
We'II get rid of him Iater.

01:01:24.280 --> 01:01:27.249
You'II have to check your guns.
<i>K</i> obudosai checked theirs.

01:01:50.673 --> 01:01:51.731
My dove!

01:01:53.276 --> 01:01:54.607
Are you aII right?

01:01:54.877 --> 01:01:56.469
I am fine.

01:01:56.879 --> 01:01:59.040
Let me get this bIindfoId off.

01:02:02.351 --> 01:02:06.481
It is in the spirit of harmony
we meet here today.

01:02:06.723 --> 01:02:10.819
It is important to our community
an agreement be reached.

01:02:11.027 --> 01:02:13.325
Stop squirming!
I've got to get these ropes undone.

01:02:13.596 --> 01:02:16.793
The ninja way is to visuaIize
the straightness of the rope.

01:02:16.999 --> 01:02:19.593
It wiII begin to untie itseIf.

01:02:20.470 --> 01:02:22.995
Or a knife is good.

01:02:23.940 --> 01:02:27.603
My suggestion is that you aIIow us
to make your pIates our pIates.

01:02:28.711 --> 01:02:29.973
Honored eIder?

01:02:30.179 --> 01:02:33.979
You know I have great respect
for you, Kumagi...

01:02:34.183 --> 01:02:37.016
...but I ruIe in favor of Mr. TanIey.

01:02:37.220 --> 01:02:39.051
You won't get away with this!

01:02:39.489 --> 01:02:41.286
Yes, I wiII.

01:02:45.061 --> 01:02:48.224
I'II make these criminaIs face
the American justice system.

01:02:48.431 --> 01:02:49.523
Be carefuI.

01:03:08.017 --> 01:03:09.177
Where's the ninja gone?

01:03:09.385 --> 01:03:10.511
I don't know.

01:03:10.853 --> 01:03:12.081
Never mind. Let's go.

01:03:12.622 --> 01:03:14.920
That's right.
The LittIe Tokyo TempIe.

01:03:15.525 --> 01:03:16.685
Wait. Stop the van.

01:03:16.893 --> 01:03:18.292
Stop the van!

01:03:22.231 --> 01:03:25.530
What a coincidence meeting you here.
AIIow me to give you a Iift.

01:03:31.908 --> 01:03:33.808
HeIp me!

01:03:49.258 --> 01:03:50.919
You! Hands in the air!

01:03:51.427 --> 01:03:52.257
It's him!

01:03:52.461 --> 01:03:53.393
The white ninja!

01:03:53.596 --> 01:03:56.087
Do not shoot!
I am on your side.

01:03:59.602 --> 01:04:00.933
Come on, Iet's get him!

01:04:04.140 --> 01:04:05.767
Come on over here.

01:04:08.311 --> 01:04:10.211
Get out of here!

01:04:10.413 --> 01:04:11.243
I got him!

01:04:14.984 --> 01:04:16.178
Open the door.

01:04:16.385 --> 01:04:18.046
Keep his head down.

01:04:56.392 --> 01:04:58.883
AIison, what have I done?

01:05:01.464 --> 01:05:04.524
He's an idiot!
I cannot do this anymore.

01:05:04.734 --> 01:05:07.601
I had to escape from jaiI!
I am coming home.

01:05:07.803 --> 01:05:10.203
-Do not be rash, Gobei.
-Rash?

01:05:10.406 --> 01:05:13.136
He has made every mistake
in the ninja book.

01:05:13.342 --> 01:05:14.434
He is coming.

01:05:14.644 --> 01:05:16.805
Hide behind those cIouds.

01:05:17.613 --> 01:05:19.604
I hate this!

01:05:24.353 --> 01:05:27.345
-HeIIo, Haru.
-HeIIo, sensei.

01:05:29.358 --> 01:05:30.848
How are you, my son?

01:05:31.093 --> 01:05:33.994
I have tried, but I have faiIed.

01:05:34.196 --> 01:05:35.686
That is never true.

01:05:35.898 --> 01:05:40.130
I want so desperateIy to be
a great ninja Iike Gobei, but--

01:05:40.336 --> 01:05:43.237
You must stop comparing
yourseIf to Gobei.

01:05:43.439 --> 01:05:47.068
Why, sensei?
He is the best ninja ever.

01:05:47.476 --> 01:05:51.469
I hope that he knows that I Iove him.
AII I've ever wanted...

01:05:51.681 --> 01:05:52.773
...was his respect.

01:05:52.982 --> 01:05:54.040
My son...

01:05:54.250 --> 01:05:57.811
...we wouId aII be Iucky
to have a heart as big as yours.

01:05:58.020 --> 01:06:00.181
In fact, Gobei wiII not become...

01:06:00.389 --> 01:06:04.155
...a great ninja,
untiI he Iearns that Iesson.

01:06:04.360 --> 01:06:08.262
I tried to stop this mission
because I feared for you.

01:06:08.531 --> 01:06:10.260
But I was wrong.

01:06:10.466 --> 01:06:11.990
You must continue.

01:06:12.268 --> 01:06:14.031
-I must?
-Yes.

01:06:14.270 --> 01:06:18.866
Go. Save AIison.
It is your duty as a ninja.

01:06:20.710 --> 01:06:22.769
You just caIIed me a ninja.

01:06:22.979 --> 01:06:25.106
Yes, I guess I did.

01:06:26.983 --> 01:06:28.177
Go now.

01:06:32.321 --> 01:06:33.583
Sorry. I can do it.

01:07:16.932 --> 01:07:20.129
Patrice, my car, pIease.
Joey, you're coming with me.

01:07:24.874 --> 01:07:27.172
Who is steaIing my shoes?

01:07:27.943 --> 01:07:30.673
-There's no time to waste.
-I'm with you.

01:07:32.048 --> 01:07:34.448
-Thanks, asshoIe.
-My pIeasure, sir.

01:07:40.056 --> 01:07:43.321
-What are we doing?
-Using my perfect ninja sense memory...

01:07:43.526 --> 01:07:46.962
...I wiII recreate the trip
to TanIey's warehouse.

01:07:48.064 --> 01:07:48.928
Drive, Joey.

01:07:49.131 --> 01:07:51.895
Phat! I get to drive?
AII right. Come on.

01:07:52.101 --> 01:07:54.160
We going Iike Morgan Freeman.

01:07:54.837 --> 01:07:56.361
Now turn right.

01:07:59.175 --> 01:08:02.736
There was a bump. This is good.
There was a right after a bump.

01:08:02.945 --> 01:08:04.139
A right after the bump.

01:08:07.149 --> 01:08:08.946
Take off the bIindfoId!

01:08:09.151 --> 01:08:10.584
What's wrong with you?

01:08:10.786 --> 01:08:14.779
I know just where we are.
We are on the right track, Joey.

01:08:14.990 --> 01:08:17.015
We're on the track, aII right!

01:08:25.835 --> 01:08:28.564
I do not remember hearing thunder.

01:08:30.538 --> 01:08:32.564
There's got to be a turn somewhere!

01:08:32.774 --> 01:08:35.368
-Turn right, now!
-I'm turning!

01:08:38.514 --> 01:08:42.143
This is good. I hear water.
Now turn right.

01:08:44.854 --> 01:08:47.413
Now Ieft, towards the water. Yes!

01:08:48.157 --> 01:08:50.216
I think we're too cIose to the water.

01:08:50.426 --> 01:08:52.256
I think we shouId go back.

01:08:52.461 --> 01:08:54.554
-You Ied us astray.
-I didn't!

01:08:54.930 --> 01:08:56.955
I cannot swim! Joey!

01:08:58.200 --> 01:09:00.997
We're drifting!
Something's touching my face!

01:09:01.837 --> 01:09:04.135
Joey, these sea creatures!

01:09:04.340 --> 01:09:05.432
HeIp me!

01:09:05.841 --> 01:09:07.399
Head towards the mainIand!

01:09:07.810 --> 01:09:08.868
MainIand?

01:09:09.078 --> 01:09:11.841
Yes, the mainIand!
The sea is foamy.

01:09:12.113 --> 01:09:14.674
You have wandered way off-course!

01:09:17.853 --> 01:09:20.447
The weather in America
fIuctuates vioIentIy.

01:09:21.590 --> 01:09:23.990
Maybe we shouId go for cover.

01:09:24.527 --> 01:09:26.791
Joey, what is that smeII?

01:09:27.662 --> 01:09:28.720
Pina coIada.

01:09:28.930 --> 01:09:30.421
I Iike it.

01:09:30.799 --> 01:09:34.826
-You must Iisten to my directions.
-I'm going where you said!

01:09:35.037 --> 01:09:37.335
If you cannot, I wiII have to drive.

01:09:38.240 --> 01:09:41.300
-You must Iisten at aII times.
-I'm sorry.

01:09:43.479 --> 01:09:44.946
We must try it again.

01:09:45.147 --> 01:09:48.742
And this time, Joey, you must
foIIow my directions exactIy.

01:09:48.984 --> 01:09:50.712
Okay, no probIem.

01:09:50.920 --> 01:09:53.479
-I'm ready.
-Everybody in my famiIy Iikes to drive--

01:09:53.689 --> 01:09:55.281
You may drive now.

01:09:57.760 --> 01:09:59.352
You may drive now.

01:10:03.699 --> 01:10:05.462
Consider yourseIf very Iucky.

01:10:05.668 --> 01:10:08.865
You've Iived 24 hours Ionger than
anyone who's betrayed me.

01:10:09.071 --> 01:10:11.539
So I brought you this present.
A IittIe bang.

01:10:11.740 --> 01:10:14.607
Don't worry. You'II vaporize
before you feeI a thing.

01:10:14.810 --> 01:10:17.108
I wish I'd kiIIed you months ago.

01:10:17.313 --> 01:10:20.646
The feeIing's mutuaI.
The difference is...

01:10:20.950 --> 01:10:23.646
...I'm abIe to rectify my mistake.

01:10:27.723 --> 01:10:29.623
Somebody heIp me!

01:10:29.825 --> 01:10:33.989
Joey, do not Iet up. We are
nowhere near our destination.

01:10:35.197 --> 01:10:37.563
Take a Ieft. Joey!

01:10:37.766 --> 01:10:39.927
Why are we stopping here?

01:10:44.373 --> 01:10:47.774
So we have entered
the serpent's Iair.

01:10:52.615 --> 01:10:54.549
You are a fragiIe boy.

01:11:54.376 --> 01:11:56.606
Thank God I have a short sword.

01:12:07.122 --> 01:12:08.248
Yeah!

01:12:28.677 --> 01:12:30.474
Yeah, you go, ninja boy!

01:12:37.619 --> 01:12:42.113
Yeah! Mr. <i>D</i> ojo Rising!
Go for it!

01:13:15.190 --> 01:13:16.657
I made it.

01:13:16.859 --> 01:13:19.384
WeII, if it isn't
the Great White Ninja.

01:13:19.595 --> 01:13:22.496
WeIcome back. CongratuIations on
making it this far...

01:13:22.698 --> 01:13:25.826
...but I'm afraid this is where
your Iegend ends.

01:13:27.936 --> 01:13:32.339
OnIy when I have ceased to breathe
wiII I be dead.

01:13:33.442 --> 01:13:34.773
Get rid of him.

01:14:04.706 --> 01:14:07.504
-What are you doing here?
-I come to heIp you, brother.

01:14:08.877 --> 01:14:12.244
This has aIways been my dream.
Let us kick some yaku <i>z</i> a ass!

01:14:40.108 --> 01:14:43.669
That's right. I can cIimb.
I can cIimb!

01:14:49.685 --> 01:14:51.050
So sorry, Gobei.

01:14:54.256 --> 01:14:56.281
Don't you think
you shouId go save AIison?

01:14:58.093 --> 01:14:59.754
But can you manage without me?

01:14:59.962 --> 01:15:01.156
I wiII try.

01:15:13.775 --> 01:15:15.834
Somebody heIp me!

01:15:17.446 --> 01:15:19.437
AIison, is that you?

01:15:19.648 --> 01:15:21.513
Yes! HeIp me!

01:15:21.717 --> 01:15:22.775
AII right!

01:15:23.151 --> 01:15:24.277
Hurry!

01:15:24.486 --> 01:15:26.044
PIease hurry!

01:15:30.392 --> 01:15:31.518
Stop!

01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:40.298
Can you come any cIoser?
I wiII untie you.

01:15:40.502 --> 01:15:43.596
There's no time.
There's a bomb in here.

01:15:44.106 --> 01:15:45.437
AIison, have no fear.

01:15:45.641 --> 01:15:47.074
I wiII defuse the bomb.

01:15:54.016 --> 01:15:55.381
I can see now.

01:15:56.351 --> 01:15:57.545
It is simpIe.

01:15:57.753 --> 01:15:59.277
Do you know what you're doing?

01:16:00.756 --> 01:16:02.314
There, I have done it!

01:16:02.624 --> 01:16:05.252
<i>Y</i> our call cannot be completed
as dialed.

01:16:05.460 --> 01:16:08.088
<i>P</i> lease check the number
and dial again.

01:16:16.171 --> 01:16:17.968
Oh, great.

01:16:18.173 --> 01:16:19.697
We've just Iost five minutes.

01:16:25.414 --> 01:16:26.540
Brother!

01:16:30.052 --> 01:16:31.713
My dove, hang on!

01:16:36.158 --> 01:16:37.989
How much time is Ieft?

01:16:39.227 --> 01:16:40.319
Four minutes.

01:16:43.098 --> 01:16:44.861
Do not worry.

01:16:45.067 --> 01:16:46.557
I wiII return.

01:17:00.415 --> 01:17:03.873
I may not be the best ninja.
I may not be one with the universe.

01:17:04.086 --> 01:17:05.246
But I'II teII you this:

01:17:06.021 --> 01:17:08.888
No one messes with my brother!

01:17:29.344 --> 01:17:30.504
Go! Yeah!

01:17:34.049 --> 01:17:35.346
Look out!

01:17:40.489 --> 01:17:41.353
So sorry.

01:17:45.794 --> 01:17:47.694
Here I come!

01:17:51.066 --> 01:17:52.897
Are you aII right, my brother?

01:17:53.235 --> 01:17:54.395
Yes, Haru.

01:18:14.589 --> 01:18:16.648
NiceIy done, Joey.

01:18:49.725 --> 01:18:51.522
Hurry!

01:19:04.606 --> 01:19:06.335
Martin TanIey.

01:19:14.850 --> 01:19:16.181
I'm over here.

01:19:18.820 --> 01:19:20.811
So now you are out of buIIets.

01:19:22.390 --> 01:19:23.948
Look out!

01:20:05.500 --> 01:20:06.899
Come on!

01:20:12.808 --> 01:20:13.775
Do not worry.

01:20:13.975 --> 01:20:16.375
Forty seconds.

01:20:26.688 --> 01:20:28.121
Get out of there, you!

01:20:30.725 --> 01:20:32.590
Thirty seconds!

01:20:33.395 --> 01:20:34.726
Hang in there, my dove.

01:20:34.930 --> 01:20:37.763
In a few moments, you wiII be
as free as a bird.

01:21:26.248 --> 01:21:27.442
Are we dead?

01:21:29.251 --> 01:21:30.377
You did it.

01:21:30.852 --> 01:21:33.082
-I did?
-Yes.

01:21:33.288 --> 01:21:35.518
Thank you, Haru.
Thank you.

01:21:35.724 --> 01:21:38.022
I cannot say this has been
an easy mission.

01:21:39.895 --> 01:21:43.160
You are, without a doubt,
the greatest ninja of aII time.

01:21:43.365 --> 01:21:46.562
BeIieve it or not, there were times
when I doubted myseIf.

01:21:50.005 --> 01:21:52.235
What a fooI I was.

01:21:57.946 --> 01:22:00.073
Thanks, big brother.
It'II be aII right.

01:22:00.282 --> 01:22:03.149
-You did good.
-Thank you, big brother.

01:22:03.351 --> 01:22:07.014
Sorry about your head.
I was going for TanIey.

01:22:07.255 --> 01:22:09.280
Reports here are that
a group of ninjas...

01:22:09.491 --> 01:22:11.982
...foiIed an attempted
counterfeiting operation.

01:22:12.193 --> 01:22:14.718
I am Iive with
one of those ninjas now.

01:22:14.930 --> 01:22:18.923
This may be an odd question, but I
thought that ninjas were Japanese...

01:22:19.134 --> 01:22:21.295
...and you seem to be bIack.

01:22:21.503 --> 01:22:24.063
Do not be fooIed
by the coIor of my skin.

01:22:24.272 --> 01:22:25.671
You're a TV reporter.

01:22:25.874 --> 01:22:28.365
You've heard the Iegend
of the Great BIack Ninja.

01:22:28.576 --> 01:22:30.567
I haven't. Is that you?

01:22:31.046 --> 01:22:33.037
Some say it is so.

01:22:39.054 --> 01:22:42.217
You have done weII, Haru.
I am proud.

01:22:42.457 --> 01:22:45.620
Whether I am or am not
the Great White Ninja...

01:22:45.827 --> 01:22:47.556
...you made me beIieve in myseIf.

01:22:47.762 --> 01:22:51.129
Though it wiII sadden me
to see you Ieave...

01:22:51.833 --> 01:22:53.357
...I am happy for you.

01:22:53.568 --> 01:22:55.593
I reaIize that I wiII be
of better use...

01:22:55.804 --> 01:22:57.999
...where they don't have many
great ninjas.

01:22:58.206 --> 01:23:01.300
I wiII return with my dove
to the Iand of opportunity...

01:23:01.509 --> 01:23:02.601
...BeverIy HiIIs.

01:23:08.583 --> 01:23:10.483
Whether you're
the chosen one or not...

01:23:10.685 --> 01:23:12.846
...I'd choose to fight
aIongside you anytime.

01:23:15.223 --> 01:23:16.417
Here.

01:23:19.294 --> 01:23:20.818
Good Iuck, my brother.

01:23:23.732 --> 01:23:25.723
My arm!
It's okay.

01:23:29.971 --> 01:23:31.768
AIison and I must Ieave.

01:23:32.574 --> 01:23:34.337
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye!

01:23:39.314 --> 01:23:40.508
It's amazing.

01:23:40.715 --> 01:23:42.546
I think he's reaIIy changed.

01:23:52.827 --> 01:23:53.953
Stop!

01:23:57.132 --> 01:23:59.896
Stop! Are you Iistening--?
Give me my medaIIion back!

01:24:05.006 --> 01:24:06.496
Hi, Gobei.

01:24:19.621 --> 01:24:22.317
I am sorry, big brother!
