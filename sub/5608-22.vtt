00:04.323 --> 00:05.456
JAMIE:
Hey.

00:05.458 --> 00:07.024
Russell.

00:07.026 --> 00:08.192
What do you got?

00:08.194 --> 00:09.326
Okay, there's been a series of
armed robberies

00:09.328 --> 00:10.561
in this neighborhood.

00:10.563 --> 00:13.063
And those two fit the
description to a tee.

00:13.065 --> 00:14.031
These guys?

00:14.033 --> 00:16.000
RUSSELL:
Yeah.

00:16.001 --> 00:17.535
Let's go.
Set?

00:17.537 --> 00:18.736
Yup.
Set.

00:24.544 --> 00:26.677
Hey, get your hands
out of your pockets!

00:26.679 --> 00:28.279
Go, go, go! Let's go!

00:28.281 --> 00:29.013
Hey! Police!

00:29.015 --> 00:30.781
JAMIE: Hey!
JANKO: Stop!

00:31.517 --> 00:32.448
(man grunts)

00:32.451 --> 00:33.918
JANKO:
Stop running!

00:34.954 --> 00:36.353
JAMIE:
Stop! Police!

00:36.355 --> 00:38.155
Watch it! Move it!
(people yelling, shouting)

00:38.758 --> 00:40.190
Aah!
Move it!

00:40.192 --> 00:42.726
Aah... (grunts)

00:44.063 --> 00:46.330
JAMIE:
Police!

00:51.671 --> 00:52.870
JAMIE:
Hands behind your back.

00:52.872 --> 00:54.104
Yeah.

00:54.106 --> 00:56.407
Stay in the car.
Stay in the car!

00:56.409 --> 00:57.775
Stop! Police!

00:57.777 --> 00:58.876
Stop!

00:58.878 --> 01:01.145
Oh, what do we have here?

01:01.147 --> 01:03.814
Huh. Okay.

01:03.816 --> 01:05.316
Look at this.

01:05.318 --> 01:06.483
Looks like you're going to jail.

01:06.485 --> 01:07.918
(distant gunshot)

01:09.655 --> 01:10.921
Call it in!

01:12.000 --> 01:18.074
Advertise your product or brand here

01:22.101 --> 01:23.133
Russell!

01:23.135 --> 01:24.568
Russell, what happened?

01:24.570 --> 01:25.903
He refused to give up the knife.

01:25.905 --> 01:28.739
Th-Th-Then he started
coming toward me.

01:28.741 --> 01:29.940
Put your gun away.

01:29.942 --> 01:31.942
Hey, back up please.
Do me a favor, back up.

01:31.944 --> 01:33.143
WOMAN: You didn't even
give him a chance!

01:33.145 --> 01:35.479
(crowd clamoring)

01:35.481 --> 01:37.881
MAN:
You didn't have to shoot him!

01:37.883 --> 01:39.016
(crowd continues yelling)

01:39.018 --> 01:40.784
He had his hands up, man!

01:40.786 --> 01:42.519
You didn't have to shoot him!

01:43.623 --> 01:44.688
I had no choice.

01:44.690 --> 01:46.890
Hey, hey, look,
I swear to God, man.

01:46.892 --> 01:48.292
I had no choice.

01:48.294 --> 01:50.194
Don't say anything else, okay?

01:51.864 --> 01:53.297
(all yelling)

01:53.299 --> 01:54.298
Stop talking.

01:54.300 --> 01:55.666
(siren wailing)

01:55.668 --> 01:57.801
He's just a kid! A kid!

01:57.803 --> 01:59.770
MAN:
...he's dead!

01:59.772 --> 02:00.738
(clamor continues)

02:00.740 --> 02:02.239
Okay, everybody
please step back.

02:02.241 --> 02:03.507
Give us some room.

02:03.509 --> 02:05.042
Please step back.

02:08.481 --> 02:11.014
(panting, running footsteps
on body-camera video)

02:11.017 --> 02:12.016
RUSSELL: Hey!

02:12.018 --> 02:13.717
Hey, put that down!

02:13.719 --> 02:15.285
MAN: <i>No hice nada.</i>

02:15.287 --> 02:17.054
Put the- put the knife down!
<i>No hice nada!</i>

02:17.056 --> 02:19.823
<i>No hice nada.</i>
<i>No hice nada.</i>

02:19.825 --> 02:22.192
I said put it down!
<i>No hice nada.</i>

02:23.796 --> 02:25.696
(turns off video)

02:25.698 --> 02:27.431
How old was the kid?

02:27.433 --> 02:28.799
Seventeen.

02:28.801 --> 02:30.501
(inhales)
Seventeen.

02:30.503 --> 02:33.504
With items stolen
in an armed robbery

02:33.506 --> 02:35.973
that triggered the incident
on his person.

02:35.975 --> 02:38.142
So?

02:38.144 --> 02:39.543
That's now a capital offense?

02:39.545 --> 02:40.844
So, he's not just a kid,

02:40.846 --> 02:43.213
he's an armed felon
confronting one of my officers.

02:43.215 --> 02:44.715
Who brought a knife
to a gunfight.

02:44.717 --> 02:46.917
That's just a saying, Mr. Mayor.

02:46.919 --> 02:49.019
You're three times as likely
to die from a stabbing

02:49.021 --> 02:50.154
as you are a gunshot.

02:50.156 --> 02:52.690
Frank, what the hell
was your guy thinking,

02:52.692 --> 02:53.891
just blowing him away?

02:53.893 --> 02:56.493
He was thinking
what he was trained to think.

02:56.495 --> 02:59.163
The suspect repeatedly
ignored commands

02:59.165 --> 03:00.831
to throw down the weapon.

03:00.833 --> 03:01.832
His hands were in the air.

03:01.834 --> 03:02.933
And one of them held a knife.

03:02.935 --> 03:05.169
Look, there's no guarantee
a cop with a gun

03:05.171 --> 03:08.005
can stop a dedicated attacker
with a knife

03:08.007 --> 03:09.239
from twice that distance.

03:09.241 --> 03:10.274
That's not the point.

03:10.276 --> 03:11.608
It's exactly the point.

03:11.610 --> 03:13.277
He could've backed away.

03:13.279 --> 03:14.511
And let the perp flee
into the population,

03:14.513 --> 03:16.847
armed with a knife,
with nothing to lose?

03:16.849 --> 03:17.815
That's your advice?

03:17.817 --> 03:19.583
So, execution?

03:19.585 --> 03:21.285
That's the only other option?

03:23.789 --> 03:26.423
You really gonna
call this an execution?

03:27.693 --> 03:30.928
Maybe you need to think
about that for a second.

03:30.930 --> 03:33.931
And Frank, you really think
I'll be the only one?

03:33.933 --> 03:35.999
What do you think the people's
takeaway's gonna be here?

03:36.001 --> 03:37.034
Throw that cop a parade?

03:37.036 --> 03:39.236
Of course not,
but the fact remains,

03:39.238 --> 03:42.673
my officer reacted
as he was trained to.

03:42.675 --> 03:45.909
Listen, I didn't realize that
the Academy offered classes

03:45.911 --> 03:47.344
in killing teenagers.

03:47.346 --> 03:49.446
That's a cheap shot,
Mr. Mayor.

03:49.448 --> 03:50.681
Yes, it is,
to a bad shooting, Frank.

03:50.683 --> 03:51.682
Get used to them.

03:51.684 --> 03:53.217
You want to honor your office,

03:53.219 --> 03:55.452
help the public to understand.

03:55.454 --> 03:58.555
Frank, my office is the mayor.

03:58.557 --> 03:59.590
Of the people.

03:59.592 --> 04:02.159
Not PR for the NYPD.

04:02.161 --> 04:03.894
Execution?

04:03.896 --> 04:06.029
Listen, that's not my word.

04:06.031 --> 04:07.431
I will not say that.

04:07.433 --> 04:08.799
But I will make
a statement, Frank,

04:08.801 --> 04:10.000
and you're not gonna like it.

04:10.002 --> 04:11.668
Because it would be premature.

04:11.670 --> 04:13.704
No, Frank, because these
pictures tell a story

04:13.706 --> 04:14.872
that any fool could see.

04:14.874 --> 04:16.673
And I cannot wait
for the result--

04:16.675 --> 04:18.041
Oh, sure you can.

04:18.043 --> 04:20.209
Listen, I can't wait for the
results of an investigation

04:20.212 --> 04:22.112
not to express the outrage
that's happened here.

04:22.113 --> 04:24.615
By any measure of
responsibility,

04:24.617 --> 04:26.583
you should wait.

04:26.585 --> 04:28.719
But if you won't...

04:28.721 --> 04:31.989
please make damn sure
you do not condemn my officer

04:31.991 --> 04:34.324
for doing his job.

04:35.294 --> 04:37.761
And that is an order,
Commissioner?

04:39.565 --> 04:40.998

05:19.085 --> 05:21.853
The video clearly contradicts
eyewitness accounts.

05:21.855 --> 05:24.056
Perez did advance
on Officer Russell.

05:24.058 --> 05:25.490
Russell also provided

05:25.492 --> 05:28.160
repeated warnings
before he fired.

05:28.162 --> 05:30.295
So it appears to be
justified use of force.

05:30.297 --> 05:32.064
But if this video
hits the Internet--

05:32.066 --> 05:33.832
a 17 year old with

05:33.834 --> 05:36.334
Get a judge to issue
a protective order

05:36.336 --> 05:37.602
to seal the video.

Already on it.

You wanted to see me?

05:40.540 --> 05:42.711
Erin's presenting
the Perez shooting

05:42.712 --> 05:43.803
to the grand jury.

05:43.903 --> 05:45.436
You'll be sitting
second chair, Marta.

05:45.438 --> 05:49.340
Will we be charging Officer
Russell prior to his appearance?

05:49.342 --> 05:50.475
Facts don't support it.

05:50.477 --> 05:52.420
EGAN: Not to mention
that charging him

05:52.421 --> 05:53.644
would cause serious tension

05:53.645 --> 05:55.478
between our office and the NYPD.

05:55.893 --> 05:59.261
Is that a relevant concern?

05:59.263 --> 06:00.529
If your job is convicting

06:00.531 --> 06:01.931
criminal defendants
in this city,

06:01.933 --> 06:03.466
it's highly relevant.

06:03.468 --> 06:05.267
EGAN: This is why God
made grand juries, Marta.

06:05.269 --> 06:13.187
Lay out the facts,
let them make the call.

06:13.189 --> 06:15.155
Sarge said things are getting
pretty ugly out there.

06:15.157 --> 06:17.091
We'll have to watch
our backs for a while.

06:17.093 --> 06:18.092
They're suspending

06:18.094 --> 06:20.427
auxiliary patrol, no more
one-man foot posts.

06:20.429 --> 06:22.296
Yeah, just till this thing
blows over.

06:22.298 --> 06:23.864
I feel really bad for Russell.

06:23.866 --> 06:27.201
Some idiot on TV is already
calling him a rogue cop.

06:27.203 --> 06:28.168
People got agendas.

06:28.170 --> 06:29.670
Got nothing to do
with the truth.

06:29.672 --> 06:30.671
Yeah.

06:30.673 --> 06:32.272
Hey, Hayes.

06:32.274 --> 06:33.273
How you guys doing?

06:33.275 --> 06:35.075
Hanging in there.
You talk to Eric?

06:35.077 --> 06:36.744
Yeah, he's pretty stressed out.

06:36.746 --> 06:37.978
Feels real bad about the kid.

06:37.980 --> 06:39.480
Send him our best.

06:39.482 --> 06:41.081
You guys talk to
shooting team investigators?

06:41.083 --> 06:42.282
Yeah, we gave our statements.

06:42.284 --> 06:44.451
Well, I know you stood up
for Russell.

06:44.453 --> 06:45.619
We were taking down
the other perp,

06:45.621 --> 06:46.687
so we didn't see the shooting.

06:46.689 --> 06:48.555
So you played it like that?

06:48.557 --> 06:50.924
He was wearing a body camera.

06:50.926 --> 06:52.326
The incident's on tape.

06:52.328 --> 06:53.560
Even if it wasn't,
we wouldn't be doing Eric

06:53.562 --> 06:55.529
any favors playing fast
and loose with the truth.

06:55.531 --> 06:57.498
He needed you guys
to have his back.

06:57.500 --> 06:59.333
We did.

06:59.335 --> 07:00.834
Whether you get that or not.

07:00.836 --> 07:02.870
(scoffs)

07:05.574 --> 07:07.908
Guess those agendas
go both ways.

07:14.283 --> 07:17.117
ERIN:
Officer Russell,

07:17.119 --> 07:18.852
did Mr. Perez have
the knife in his hand

07:18.854 --> 07:19.920
when you were chasing him?

07:19.922 --> 07:21.655
No.

07:21.657 --> 07:23.590
He pulled the knife
out of his pocket

07:23.592 --> 07:24.792
after he stopped running.

07:24.794 --> 07:26.527
Your body-cam video

07:26.529 --> 07:28.362
shows Mr. Perez
with his hands in the air.

07:28.364 --> 07:30.297
Why did you find it
necessary to fire?

07:30.299 --> 07:32.533
He still had the knife.

07:32.535 --> 07:34.268
He continued to advance on me.

07:34.270 --> 07:35.502
I ordered him to stop.

07:35.504 --> 07:36.503
Did you consider
falling back

07:36.505 --> 07:38.505
to wait for other officers?

07:38.507 --> 07:40.007
RUSSELL:
I couldn't take that chance.

07:40.009 --> 07:42.843
I feared for the lives of the
bystanders in the vicinity.

07:42.845 --> 07:45.679
Did you fear for
your own life as well?

07:46.949 --> 07:48.882
Yes.

07:48.884 --> 07:50.184
Officer Russell,

07:50.186 --> 07:53.020
would you like to make any
further statements at this time?

07:54.457 --> 07:56.323
I just want to say...

07:56.325 --> 07:58.559
I did my job...

07:58.561 --> 08:00.994
as I was trained to do it.

08:00.996 --> 08:02.596
And I'd do it again.

08:02.598 --> 08:05.399
But the last thing
I ever wanted to do

08:05.401 --> 08:06.733
was shoot that kid.

08:18.614 --> 08:21.014
Yeah.

08:21.016 --> 08:23.150
Thanks for the heads up, John.

08:24.286 --> 08:25.986
My source says the grand jury

08:25.988 --> 08:28.522
declined to indict
Officer Russell.

08:28.524 --> 08:31.191
Well, that's huge, boss!

08:31.193 --> 08:32.726
Your source at the DA's Office?

08:32.727 --> 08:35.462
Are you kidding?
Not a chance.

08:35.464 --> 08:36.964
Well, at least that's good news.

08:36.966 --> 08:38.599
Well, in five minutes,

08:38.601 --> 08:39.566
it'll be old news.

08:39.568 --> 08:40.701
Well, all due respect, boss,

08:40.703 --> 08:42.269
you ever savor the moment?

08:42.270 --> 08:44.838
Not when what's
just around the corner.

08:44.840 --> 08:45.806
Game plan's in place.

08:45.808 --> 08:47.107
All precincts are on high alert.

08:47.109 --> 08:49.209
There's gonna be a lot
of anger out there, Sid.

08:49.211 --> 08:51.378
I don't want any
unnecessary confrontations.

08:51.380 --> 08:53.447
Understood.
But if it gets hot...

08:53.449 --> 08:55.716
Throw water on it, not gasoline.

08:56.719 --> 08:59.086
Somebody leaked the body-cam
of the Perez shooting.

09:01.757 --> 09:04.124
Who?
I don't know.

09:04.126 --> 09:05.792
It went viral in 20 minutes.

09:07.396 --> 09:09.396
Here he goes.

09:09.398 --> 09:11.098
What do you think
he's gonna say?

09:11.100 --> 09:12.900
I got a hunch.

09:12.902 --> 09:14.801
The NYPD officer who shot and
killed Diego Perez

09:14.803 --> 09:16.803
has been exonerated
by a grand jury.

09:16.805 --> 09:19.106
However, the body-cam video
of the incident

09:19.108 --> 09:21.475
raises serious questions
about the use of force

09:21.477 --> 09:23.977
by the NYPD, in this case...

09:23.979 --> 09:26.213
Talk about gasoline on the fire.

09:26.215 --> 09:27.948
POOLE: ...questions that go
above and beyond the purview

09:27.950 --> 09:29.683
of a single grand jury panel.

09:29.685 --> 09:32.686
So I am ordering a full
and independent investigation

09:32.688 --> 09:35.489
of this matter,
effective immediately.

09:36.292 --> 09:37.624
GARRETT:
Son of a bitch.

09:38.327 --> 09:39.760
What are you gonna do, Frank?

09:41.030 --> 09:43.697
What I'm paid to do: my job.

09:45.234 --> 09:47.134
(sighs)

09:49.772 --> 09:51.805
I can't believe that body-cam
video's on the Internet.

09:51.807 --> 09:53.473
As if things weren't tense
enough already.

09:53.475 --> 09:55.375
You got to figure people
are gonna see that

09:55.377 --> 09:56.643
and they're gonna
realize that Russell...

09:56.645 --> 09:58.045
he didn't have
a choice, right?

09:58.047 --> 09:59.246
I think people are gonna see

09:59.248 --> 10:00.647
what they want to see, Eddie.

10:00.649 --> 10:01.848
(radio beeps)

10:01.850 --> 10:03.283
HAYES (over radio):
12 Frank, show us responding

10:03.285 --> 10:05.452
to the commercial alarm
at 1813 Green.

10:06.755 --> 10:08.956
Uh, Central, we're a few blocks
away from that commercial alarm.

10:08.958 --> 10:10.524
Show us on the back.

10:10.526 --> 10:12.259
(over radio):
We're good, 12 David.

10:12.261 --> 10:13.594
We got this.

10:14.763 --> 10:17.331
Orders are no calls
without backup, 12 Frank.

10:17.333 --> 10:19.266
(gunshot over radio)
PARTNER: Mark! Aah!

10:19.268 --> 10:21.001
Mark, units!
Mark, Mark!

10:21.003 --> 10:23.136
(siren wailing)
Hey, Hayes, you guys all right?

10:23.138 --> 10:24.705
12 Frank, I got an officer down!

10:24.707 --> 10:25.973
Officer shot at his location!

10:25.975 --> 10:28.141
Well, hang on, Hayes,
we're coming!

10:33.048 --> 10:34.514
Eyes open, keep your eyes open.
Breathe.

10:34.516 --> 10:35.582
Mark, come on.
(groaning)

10:35.584 --> 10:36.550
Hang in there.

10:36.552 --> 10:37.684
Hayes!

10:37.686 --> 10:38.685
Hayes!

10:38.687 --> 10:39.987
JANKO:
What happened?

10:39.989 --> 10:41.788
Hey. Guy came out of nowhere.
Shot through the window.

10:41.790 --> 10:43.423
We never had a chance
to see who it was.

10:43.425 --> 10:44.691
Come on, keep pr--
keep pressure on it.

10:44.693 --> 10:46.126
Help is on the way, brother.
It's on the way, buddy.

10:46.128 --> 10:47.127
Help is on the way.
Keep your eyes open.

10:47.129 --> 10:48.362
Anybody see anybody?

10:48.364 --> 10:50.564
You see a shooter?
You see anything?

10:50.566 --> 10:52.165
Anybody see which way
the shooter went?

10:52.167 --> 10:53.867
Hey, hey, anybody see anything?

10:53.869 --> 10:55.002
You guys see a shooter?

10:55.004 --> 10:56.436
Come on, come on.

10:56.438 --> 10:57.337
Anybody see anything?
Hey, come on!

10:57.339 --> 10:58.438
Somebody talk to me!

11:01.610 --> 11:03.710
Anybody see a shooter?

11:03.712 --> 11:05.545
Anybody see which way he went?

11:12.801 --> 11:14.034
As you were.

11:14.036 --> 11:16.755
And make sure we have someone
assigned to his family.

11:16.756 --> 11:18.088
Of course.

11:18.090 --> 11:19.824
(reporters clamoring)

11:19.826 --> 11:21.892
(sighs heavily)

11:21.894 --> 11:23.527
(clamor continues)

11:23.529 --> 11:26.192
(clears throat)
Let's just stick to the facts.

11:26.193 --> 11:27.693
Thanks for the tip.

11:27.695 --> 11:28.694
(reporters clamoring)

11:28.696 --> 11:30.863
We only have time
for a few questions.

11:30.865 --> 11:32.264
What's the condition
of the wounded officer?

11:32.266 --> 11:34.700
Officer Hayes had surgery
to remove a bullet

11:34.702 --> 11:36.335
next to his spine.

11:36.337 --> 11:38.170
Was this an act of
revenge against the NYPD

11:38.172 --> 11:39.705
in the wake of
the Perez decision?

11:39.707 --> 11:41.073
Well, it's an
ongoing investigation,

11:41.075 --> 11:44.576
but it certainly appears that
Officer Hayes and his partner

11:44.578 --> 11:46.879
were targeted because
they were police officers.

11:46.881 --> 11:48.013
(reporters yelling)

11:48.015 --> 11:50.182
Some believe that the
reason that your officer

11:50.184 --> 11:51.950
was not indicted
for killing Diego Perez,

11:51.952 --> 11:53.619
is because he was
wearing a badge.

11:55.256 --> 11:58.390
Officer Russell did his duty
protecting lives.

11:58.392 --> 11:59.958
That's what
the grand jury found.

11:59.960 --> 12:02.628
Will the NYPD be reviewing
its use of force policies?

12:02.630 --> 12:03.996
No.

12:03.998 --> 12:06.732
Has the source of the leaked
body-cam video been identified?

12:06.734 --> 12:09.134
Not yet, but clearly,
we are looking for someone

12:09.136 --> 12:12.037
with access to the system
and an ax to grind.

12:12.039 --> 12:13.238
Namely?
(reporters clamoring)

12:13.240 --> 12:14.673
Namely, I don't know, Helen.

12:16.410 --> 12:19.645
But the mayor did call for
an independent investigation

12:19.647 --> 12:22.948
into the Perez shooting,
and you can be damn sure

12:22.950 --> 12:25.517
we will have our own
independent investigation

12:25.519 --> 12:28.487
to find out who
is responsible for the leak.

12:28.489 --> 12:30.255
That's all the time
we have for now.

12:30.257 --> 12:32.691
(reporters clamoring)

12:34.795 --> 12:37.296
(heart monitor beeping steadily)

12:37.298 --> 12:38.263
Hey, Eric.

12:38.265 --> 12:39.698
Guys.

12:40.434 --> 12:41.500
Hey.

12:41.502 --> 12:42.868
You know, everyone's
pulling for you

12:42.870 --> 12:44.770
back at the house.
Anything you need?

12:44.772 --> 12:47.406
I'm okay.

12:47.408 --> 12:49.208
I know you guys think
I was out of line

12:49.210 --> 12:50.676
about you covering for Russell

12:50.678 --> 12:51.910
with IAB.

12:51.912 --> 12:54.480
Hang on, I never asked for
anyone to cover for me.

12:54.482 --> 12:55.514
Hey...

12:55.516 --> 12:57.549
No, listen,
none of that matters now.

12:57.551 --> 12:59.451
Yeah, it does.

12:59.453 --> 13:01.120
Eric's my best friend,

13:01.122 --> 13:02.488
but it's more than that.

13:02.490 --> 13:04.756
It's war on the streets:
us against them.

13:04.758 --> 13:05.757
Yeah, well, there's a right way

13:05.759 --> 13:07.259
and a wrong way to fight it.

13:07.261 --> 13:08.827
It's not about right and wrong,

13:08.829 --> 13:11.363
it's about life and death.

13:11.365 --> 13:15.234
If cops don't stand up
for cops... cops lose.

13:16.804 --> 13:19.438
Like I did.

13:26.947 --> 13:28.046
Plan on spending the night?

13:28.048 --> 13:29.114
(sighs)

13:29.116 --> 13:30.215
I can't believe someone

13:30.217 --> 13:33.051
would try to kill
a police officer like that.

13:33.053 --> 13:35.554
Well, when a kid like Diego
Perez gets killed by a cop,

13:35.556 --> 13:36.922
especially these days,

13:36.924 --> 13:38.557
you can bet all hell's
gonna break loose.

13:38.559 --> 13:40.626
I just keep thinking that maybe
it wouldn't have happened,

13:40.628 --> 13:41.793
if we would've charged
Officer Russell

13:41.795 --> 13:44.496
before we took him
to the grand jury.

13:44.498 --> 13:46.565
Well, you can't charge people
on public opinion,

13:46.567 --> 13:48.800
or what might keep the peace.

13:48.802 --> 13:50.169
We presented the facts.

13:50.171 --> 13:52.171
Perez's family claimed
that he didn't speak English

13:52.173 --> 13:54.339
well enough to understand
Officer Russell's commands,

13:54.341 --> 13:56.642
but we didn't present that
to the grand jury.

13:56.644 --> 13:59.044
That's because
we interviewed others,

13:59.046 --> 14:01.213
including Perez's accomplice,

14:01.215 --> 14:03.015
who said his English was fluent.

14:03.017 --> 14:06.051
And he did respond to Officer
Russell's command to halt.

14:06.053 --> 14:09.188
I'm just saying that maybe
if we would've, you know,

14:09.190 --> 14:11.657
presented them with
a more complete picture...

14:11.659 --> 14:13.258
We gave the grand jury
what they needed

14:13.260 --> 14:14.960
to make a decision
on an indictment.

14:15.996 --> 14:19.665
I know you may feel responsible
for what happened

14:19.667 --> 14:21.967
to Officer Hayes,
but you're not.

14:21.969 --> 14:24.670
Sometimes cases blow up.

14:24.672 --> 14:28.006
But that doesn't mean
you didn't do your job.

14:33.647 --> 14:35.380
(indistinct police radio
communication)

14:35.382 --> 14:36.448
How we doing?
Hey.

14:36.450 --> 14:37.649
Uh, good.

14:37.651 --> 14:39.551
Guys found a .38 in an alley
a couple blocks from here,

14:39.553 --> 14:41.353
but it's not the gun
used in the Hayes shooting.

14:41.355 --> 14:42.354
Nice neighborhood.

14:42.356 --> 14:43.355
Any physical evidence?

14:43.357 --> 14:45.123
Not yet, but we got
all hands down here.

14:45.125 --> 14:46.558
How about witnesses?

14:46.560 --> 14:48.227
We're not getting much
cooperation from the community.

14:48.229 --> 14:49.895
Well, this street was
crowded when this went down.

14:49.897 --> 14:52.097
Someone must've seen something.

14:52.099 --> 14:53.165
Folks in this neighborhood

14:53.167 --> 14:54.466
don't like cops
under normal circumstances.

14:54.468 --> 14:55.834
Well, these ain't
normal circumstances.

14:55.836 --> 14:57.469
Keep us updated,
and you guys be careful.

14:57.471 --> 14:59.738
All right, shooter
must've come this way,

14:59.740 --> 15:00.939
ran up on the car here,

15:00.941 --> 15:04.243
blasted Hayes right through
the window here.

15:04.245 --> 15:05.677
Took off that way.

15:05.679 --> 15:08.247
So when the shooter
stopped to take aim,

15:08.249 --> 15:09.915
that's our best bet
at an I.D.

15:09.917 --> 15:11.550
Yeah. Let's take a walk.

15:13.587 --> 15:14.553
Hey!

15:14.555 --> 15:15.754
You own this newsstand?

15:15.756 --> 15:16.855
Yeah.

15:16.857 --> 15:18.056
You working here
last night?

15:18.058 --> 15:19.091
I don't see nothing.

15:19.093 --> 15:20.892
You know it was a cop
that got shot, right?

15:20.894 --> 15:22.828
I mind my own business.

15:22.830 --> 15:24.396
What's your name,
Mr. Mind Your Own Business?

15:24.398 --> 15:26.265
Hector Castillo.

15:26.267 --> 15:27.232
Hector Castillo,

15:27.234 --> 15:28.433
you realize without the police

15:28.435 --> 15:30.302
looking out for people like you
in the community,

15:30.304 --> 15:31.770
you wouldn't even
have a business here,

15:31.772 --> 15:32.771
Mr. Castillo, right?

15:32.773 --> 15:34.506
Like I say,
I don't see nothing.

15:34.508 --> 15:35.474
Yeah.

15:35.476 --> 15:37.409
Okay.
You know that woman over there?

15:39.113 --> 15:41.546
(sighs)
Yeah, it's my daughter.

15:41.548 --> 15:43.382
All right, have a nice day.

15:45.452 --> 15:46.518
What's your name?

15:46.520 --> 15:49.021
Gabby.

15:49.023 --> 15:51.490
Gabby, were you
working here last night?

15:51.492 --> 15:52.624
She wasn't here last night.

15:52.626 --> 15:53.792
I thought you said
you mind your own business!

15:53.794 --> 15:55.560
And we got work to do!

15:59.800 --> 16:01.667
Cop gets shot
in the street like this

16:01.669 --> 16:03.602
and nobody sees a damn thing.

16:05.806 --> 16:08.974
Nothing bad, or nothing at all?

16:08.976 --> 16:10.509
About Officer Russell?

16:10.511 --> 16:12.044
Well, people are talking
about him, obviously,

16:12.046 --> 16:13.712
but it's just in
regards to the incident.

16:13.714 --> 16:14.680
What's this all about?

16:14.682 --> 16:16.014
Between us?

16:16.016 --> 16:17.883
Of course.

16:17.885 --> 16:21.253
The mayor's conducting some kind
of independent investigation.

16:21.255 --> 16:22.721
I expect they're
turning over rocks

16:22.723 --> 16:26.391
to see if they can gerrymander
some other plan of attack.

16:26.393 --> 16:28.994
Or just good old
character assassination?

16:28.996 --> 16:30.829
Or both.

16:30.831 --> 16:32.397
Don't know.

16:32.399 --> 16:34.433
Can you keep your ears open?

16:34.435 --> 16:36.768
See who they're talking to,
what their angle is?

16:36.770 --> 16:38.904
Much as I can.

16:38.906 --> 16:40.305
(knocking on door)

16:47.781 --> 16:48.980
Hey.

16:48.982 --> 16:50.449
You want me to wait?

16:53.921 --> 16:54.886
I'm just going.

16:54.888 --> 16:56.521
See you both on Sunday.

16:58.525 --> 17:00.225
(door closes)

17:00.227 --> 17:02.327
I really shouldn't be here, Dad.

17:02.329 --> 17:03.662
Why not?
You're my daughter.

17:03.664 --> 17:06.798
Whose office is in the chain
of custody of the leaked video.

17:06.800 --> 17:08.032
Did you leak it?

17:08.035 --> 17:09.434
No.

17:09.435 --> 17:10.402
Well, then we're good.

17:10.404 --> 17:12.104
And since you came up
the back way,

17:12.106 --> 17:13.171
no one's the wiser.

17:13.173 --> 17:15.272
What can I do for you?

17:18.244 --> 17:21.246
I think they mayor
may be behind the leak.

17:21.248 --> 17:22.914
Yeah, I think the press
has picked up on that.

17:22.915 --> 17:25.784
Yeah, well, what do <i>you</i> think?

17:25.786 --> 17:27.219
I think he's a sitting mayor

17:27.221 --> 17:30.288
and you're taking a huge risk
by publicly inferring that.

17:30.290 --> 17:32.324
Do you think the mayor
ordered the leak?

17:32.326 --> 17:34.393
To what end?

17:34.395 --> 17:36.561
To marginalize my department.

17:36.563 --> 17:38.563
And your office.

17:38.565 --> 17:40.098
To effectively pronounce

17:40.100 --> 17:42.234
that we cannot be trusted
in a matter like this,

17:42.236 --> 17:43.602
only he can.

17:43.604 --> 17:45.570
The mayor is not
the only one upset

17:45.572 --> 17:47.205
about this shooting, you know.

17:47.207 --> 17:48.907
But he had access and motive.

17:48.909 --> 17:52.110
That is a very serious
charge, Dad.

17:52.112 --> 17:54.546
Well...

17:54.548 --> 17:57.315
now I need evidence
to back it up.

17:57.317 --> 18:01.386
The DA has assigned
a team of investigators

18:01.388 --> 18:02.721
to trace that leak.

18:02.723 --> 18:04.022
I am not part of it.

18:04.024 --> 18:05.891
I understand.

18:05.893 --> 18:08.994
But I also understand
the reach of City Hall.

18:08.996 --> 18:12.697
You want me to monitor
the investigation

18:12.699 --> 18:15.567
and report back to you?

18:15.569 --> 18:16.768
That would be a no.

18:16.770 --> 18:18.170
(taps desk)

18:18.172 --> 18:20.439
I'm asking you
to help me find the truth.

18:20.441 --> 18:22.374
Oh, well,
when you put it that way,

18:22.376 --> 18:23.542
the answer is still no,

18:23.544 --> 18:26.278
as you know it has to be.

18:29.583 --> 18:31.783
I ask you to respect that.

18:32.920 --> 18:35.987
(door opens)
(sighs)

18:35.989 --> 18:38.056
(door closes)

18:42.696 --> 18:43.762
What do we got?

18:43.764 --> 18:45.530
Suspect wearing clothes
Hayes described.

18:45.532 --> 18:46.932
It may be our cop shooter.

18:46.934 --> 18:48.066
Male wearing a
purple track jacket

18:48.068 --> 18:49.267
entering this building.

18:49.269 --> 18:50.869
All right, you two go this way
through the lobby,

18:50.871 --> 18:53.305
I'm gonna go this way in case
he makes a break for it.

18:57.611 --> 18:58.810
Hey... Hey!

19:03.250 --> 19:04.449
Stop!

19:07.354 --> 19:09.321
Police!

19:09.323 --> 19:11.490
Stop! Police!

19:11.492 --> 19:13.658
Police!

19:17.764 --> 19:19.731
Put your hands on the back
of your head right now.

19:19.733 --> 19:21.132
Turn around, get on the ground,

19:21.134 --> 19:23.735
and put your hands on the back
of your head right now!

19:23.737 --> 19:26.605
I said put your hands
on the back of your head!

19:33.514 --> 19:35.146
Okay.

19:35.148 --> 19:36.982
My hands are up.

19:36.984 --> 19:39.818
You got not witnesses.

19:39.820 --> 19:41.386
So go ahead.

19:41.388 --> 19:43.088
Kill me.

19:43.090 --> 19:44.789
You gonna test me?

19:44.791 --> 19:46.091
Come on.

19:47.461 --> 19:48.827
Kill me.

19:50.631 --> 19:53.164
Kill me like
you killed that kid.

19:55.736 --> 19:57.335
Well, I suppose I could.

19:59.473 --> 20:01.973
Do it.

20:01.975 --> 20:04.776
But then I'd be saving you...
from a life in prison.

20:04.778 --> 20:05.844
Do it. Do it!

20:05.846 --> 20:08.346
You're under arrest,
you son of a bitch.

20:08.348 --> 20:10.382
(handcuffs clicking)
Come on!

20:10.384 --> 20:11.750
Come on.

20:21.807 --> 20:23.941
You're in a lot
of trouble, Santana.

20:25.945 --> 20:27.477
I got nothing to say to you.

20:27.479 --> 20:29.413
You don't like
cops much, do you?

20:29.415 --> 20:31.448
Unlock these chains,

20:31.450 --> 20:33.150
and I'll show you how much.

20:33.152 --> 20:35.652
Trust me, there's nothing
I'd like to do more

20:35.654 --> 20:37.721
than take those off
and kick your ass.

20:37.723 --> 20:38.689
(snorts)

20:38.691 --> 20:40.057
DANNY:
But business before pleasure.

20:40.059 --> 20:42.092
Some scumbag matching
your description

20:42.094 --> 20:43.393
shot a cop in your neighborhood.

20:43.395 --> 20:45.028
Don't know nothing about that.

20:45.030 --> 20:47.931
We're gonna stay here
until you give it up, Miguel.

20:47.933 --> 20:49.766
I didn't shoot no cop.

20:49.768 --> 20:51.368
Then why'd you run
when you saw us?

20:51.370 --> 20:54.371
Maybe you haven't heard, hmm?

20:54.373 --> 20:56.740
Cops like to shoot guys
who look like me

20:56.742 --> 20:58.542
for no good reason.

20:58.544 --> 21:00.010
You've got a sheet
a mile long:

21:00.012 --> 21:00.978
assault, armed robbery,

21:00.980 --> 21:02.012
Mm-hmm. Right.
selling guns.

21:02.014 --> 21:04.348
Which doesn't prove
a damn thing.

21:04.350 --> 21:06.984
You got nothing.

21:06.986 --> 21:09.052
And you know it.

21:10.155 --> 21:11.989
Hey...

21:11.991 --> 21:13.390
DANNY:
you were pissed off

21:13.392 --> 21:14.992
when Diego Perez was killed.
Yeah.

21:14.994 --> 21:16.927
But I wasn't surprised.

21:16.929 --> 21:18.128
But you wanted payback.

21:18.130 --> 21:19.463
So you decided to take out

21:19.465 --> 21:20.931
a cop and try and get even.

21:20.933 --> 21:23.834
The cop didn't die.

21:23.836 --> 21:24.868
That ain't even.

21:24.870 --> 21:27.537
Yeah, but you wanted
to be a hero.

21:27.539 --> 21:30.507
You wanted to be a big,
bad man in the neighborhood.

21:30.509 --> 21:32.442
Well, now's your chance
to tell the whole world

21:32.444 --> 21:34.344
about what you did.

21:34.346 --> 21:35.579
Start talking.

21:41.954 --> 21:43.754
I want a lawyer.

21:45.524 --> 21:48.325
You're gonna need one.

21:48.327 --> 21:49.426
Call his lawyer.

21:49.428 --> 21:50.627
Yeah.

21:52.998 --> 21:54.931
Watch him.

21:54.933 --> 21:57.300
That son of a bitch
is lucky you're watching.

21:57.302 --> 22:00.237
Unfortunately, all you've got
is resisting arrest.

22:00.239 --> 22:01.238
Even that's a stretch.

22:01.240 --> 22:02.372
What are you talking about?

22:02.374 --> 22:03.707
He fits the description

22:03.709 --> 22:05.909
that Officer Hayes
gave of the shooter.

22:05.911 --> 22:07.811
A matching garment
is not a positive I.D.

22:07.813 --> 22:09.379
You have the gun
that was used to shoot Hayes?

22:09.381 --> 22:10.547
Well, not yet.

22:10.549 --> 22:12.282
Any witnesses?

22:12.284 --> 22:14.351
No! No one's talking yet.

22:14.353 --> 22:15.585
(sighs)

22:15.587 --> 22:18.588
I want to nail the guy who shot
Hayes as much as you do.

22:18.590 --> 22:20.123
Wow, could've fooled me.

22:20.125 --> 22:21.692
The public is angry

22:21.694 --> 22:23.560
that the grand jury
refused to indict

22:23.562 --> 22:26.163
Officer Russell
for shooting Perez.

22:26.165 --> 22:28.331
What the hell does one case
have to do with the other one?

22:28.333 --> 22:29.533
Everything.

22:29.535 --> 22:32.402
They saw a cop shoot a
kid with his hands raised.

22:32.404 --> 22:33.737
Regardless of the facts,

22:33.739 --> 22:36.073
a lot of people do not
consider that justice.

22:36.075 --> 22:37.574
Well, that's their problem.

22:37.576 --> 22:38.442
Actually, it's ours.

22:38.444 --> 22:40.510
How?
If we charge Santana

22:40.512 --> 22:42.279
on questionable evidence,

22:42.281 --> 22:45.348
an already volatile situation
is gonna get a lot worse.

22:45.350 --> 22:46.717
This son of a bitch, Santana,

22:46.719 --> 22:49.219
shot a cop at point-blank range!

22:49.221 --> 22:50.253
Maybe.

22:50.255 --> 22:52.289
But in the wake
of the Perez verdict,

22:52.291 --> 22:54.157
the DA will not charge Santana

22:54.159 --> 22:56.126
unless you have him
dead to rights.

22:56.128 --> 22:58.061
I'm sorry.

23:01.233 --> 23:02.699
JAMIE:
Hey, Eric.

23:02.701 --> 23:03.700
How you doing?

23:03.702 --> 23:05.235
Hanging in.

23:05.237 --> 23:06.837
Word on the street is you're
transferring to Staten Island?

23:06.839 --> 23:09.706
Somebody posted
my home address online.

23:09.708 --> 23:11.775
My wife and kids
have gotten threats.

23:11.777 --> 23:13.477
You're gonna be missed
around here, Eric.

23:13.479 --> 23:16.646
I-I can't get that kid's face
out of my head, you know?

23:16.648 --> 23:18.515
Diego Perez screwed up,

23:18.517 --> 23:19.750
got himself killed.

23:19.752 --> 23:21.585
That's on him, not you.

23:21.587 --> 23:23.120
Yeah.

23:23.122 --> 23:25.388
But I'm the one
that has to live with it.

23:33.465 --> 23:35.932
So how's the case against
the guy who shot our cop?

23:35.934 --> 23:37.934
Not good enough
for the DA's Office.

23:37.936 --> 23:39.870
You know it's not, Danny.

23:39.872 --> 23:41.738
You know we could use
a little support, Erin.

23:41.740 --> 23:43.540
Looking for love
in the wrong place.

23:43.542 --> 23:44.708
We're doing our job.

23:44.710 --> 23:47.010
Yeah, well, Russell and Hayes
were doing just that,

23:47.012 --> 23:49.479
their jobs, and now they're
looking at losing those jobs.

23:49.481 --> 23:51.481
HENRY: Santana has to pay
for shooting a cop.

23:51.483 --> 23:54.785
All hands should be
on that deck.

23:54.787 --> 23:56.386
Okay, but that's not
the way it works,

23:56.388 --> 23:57.587
and you all know that.

23:57.589 --> 23:59.589
Search of his apartment
came up empty.

23:59.591 --> 24:01.725
The guy's good at
covering his tracks.

24:01.727 --> 24:03.226
That's because a snake
never leaves tracks.

24:03.228 --> 24:04.327
Actually, they do.

24:04.329 --> 24:05.462
What?

24:05.464 --> 24:07.097
Just sayin'.
Well, don't.

24:07.900 --> 24:09.833
Look, charging Santana

24:09.835 --> 24:11.635
with just
circumstantial evidence,

24:11.637 --> 24:14.237
in the wake of the kid
with the knife being killed,

24:14.239 --> 24:15.906
could push the city
over the edge.

24:15.908 --> 24:16.873
We all get that.

24:16.875 --> 24:18.308
Thank you.

24:18.310 --> 24:20.744
But you start letting the court
of public opinion hold sway...

24:20.746 --> 24:21.978
We're not...
You're pretty much

24:21.980 --> 24:23.980
telling justice to take a hike.

24:23.982 --> 24:25.882
That is not what is happening.

24:25.884 --> 24:28.919
The standards for evidence
have not been met.

24:28.921 --> 24:29.820
JACK: Here's what I just
don't understand

24:29.822 --> 24:30.987
about this whole thing:

24:30.989 --> 24:34.291
The tape clearly shows Perez
coming up to a cop

24:34.293 --> 24:35.325
with a knife out.

24:35.327 --> 24:36.526
What did he think would happen?

24:36.528 --> 24:37.794
Exactly right.

24:37.796 --> 24:38.829
Really?

24:38.831 --> 24:40.697
Nicky, please.

24:40.699 --> 24:42.299
You got another opinion, Nicky?

24:42.301 --> 24:44.467
Look, I'm not saying that Diego
Perez didn't make a mistake.

24:44.469 --> 24:46.036
He made a lot of mistakes.

24:46.038 --> 24:47.270
Yeah, armed robbery,
for starters.

24:47.272 --> 24:49.139
NICKY:
Okay, yes,

24:49.141 --> 24:51.641
but at some point there has to
be alternative to deadly force.

24:51.643 --> 24:53.743
You can't give
someone a death sentence

24:53.745 --> 24:55.245
for stealing a watch
or an iPhone.

24:55.247 --> 24:56.279
DANNY:
You're right.

24:56.281 --> 24:58.181
You are, you're
absolutely right.

24:58.183 --> 24:59.616
Officer Russell

24:59.618 --> 25:01.484
should've taken
the one and a half seconds

25:01.486 --> 25:03.787
that stood between
a knife and his throat,

25:03.789 --> 25:06.056
and asked this
Diego Perez character,

25:06.058 --> 25:07.057
"Hey, how you feeling?"

25:07.059 --> 25:09.292
LINDA: That is not what
Nicky is saying.

25:09.294 --> 25:10.694
It just seems
It is what she's saying.

25:10.696 --> 25:12.696
like these things happen
way too often.

25:12.698 --> 25:13.763
Thank you.

25:13.765 --> 25:15.699
Like cops getting shot
for doing their job?

25:15.701 --> 25:16.967
Thank you.

25:16.969 --> 25:18.101
From where I sit,

25:18.103 --> 25:21.838
Officer Russell
did the right thing.

25:21.840 --> 25:24.441
The problem is
somewhere along the line

25:24.443 --> 25:28.778
the trust between the cops
and the public broke down.

25:28.780 --> 25:32.382
And there's plenty of blame
to go around.

25:32.384 --> 25:35.085
But until both sides start
working

25:35.087 --> 25:37.354
to restore that trust...

25:37.356 --> 25:39.489
neither side's gonna be safe.

26:02.481 --> 26:04.581
Nicky doesn't mean
any disrespect,

26:04.583 --> 26:05.582
she's just...

26:05.584 --> 26:06.883
Young.

26:09.321 --> 26:12.222
After one year of college,
apparently all-knowing.

26:13.191 --> 26:15.859
I seem to remember
somebody else like that.

26:15.861 --> 26:17.901
I know, Jamie was really
full of himself, wasn't he?

26:22.167 --> 26:23.333
Listen, Dad, I just
heard from...

26:23.335 --> 26:25.001
Before you start...

26:25.003 --> 26:25.969
I'm sorry.

26:25.971 --> 26:27.904
I should not have
asked you to come up

26:27.906 --> 26:30.640
and put you in the spot.

26:30.642 --> 26:32.709
That's true.

26:34.746 --> 26:37.881
And I shouldn't be
saying this to you:

26:37.883 --> 26:39.983
The leak did not come
from the Mayor's Office.

26:39.985 --> 26:43.253
(sighs)

26:43.255 --> 26:46.122
Have you identified
the individual responsible?

26:46.124 --> 26:48.024
Not yet.

26:48.026 --> 26:49.693
Our people are
questioning all personnel

26:49.695 --> 26:52.562
who had hands-on access
to the tape.

26:56.234 --> 26:57.867
And they're 100% sure?

26:57.869 --> 26:59.903
We've identified the server
that was used

26:59.905 --> 27:01.438
to disseminate the video.

27:01.440 --> 27:02.706
It came from the courthouse

27:02.708 --> 27:04.641
where the grand jury
was empaneled.

27:04.643 --> 27:07.777
I see.

27:13.418 --> 27:15.585
Guess I need to
talk to the mayor.

27:28.767 --> 27:30.800
Sunday night at the office.

27:30.802 --> 27:32.235
It's the city
that never sleeps, Frank.

27:32.237 --> 27:33.370
Haven't you heard?

27:34.973 --> 27:36.106
The district attorney confirmed

27:36.108 --> 27:39.042
that the leak did not
come from here.

27:39.044 --> 27:41.177
Sorry to disappoint you.

27:41.179 --> 27:45.448
I may have implied that it
was you that released the tape.

27:45.450 --> 27:47.751
<i>May</i> have, Frank?

27:47.753 --> 27:50.453
You flat-out said it
in a room full of reporters.

27:50.455 --> 27:52.489
I apologize. I was wrong.

27:52.491 --> 27:54.224
And I fully understand

27:54.226 --> 27:58.128
if you feel I can no longer
serve as your commissioner.

28:01.767 --> 28:04.034
Frank, you know,
the surgeon who operated

28:04.036 --> 28:06.803
on Officer Hayes,

28:06.805 --> 28:09.806
operated on me when I was shot.

28:09.808 --> 28:11.007
Saved my life.

28:11.009 --> 28:12.976
But everything changed.

28:12.978 --> 28:15.278
And now Officer Hayes faces
some of the same realities.

28:15.280 --> 28:18.181
His career with
the NYPD is over.

28:18.183 --> 28:21.785
The Department,
his union will take care of him

28:21.787 --> 28:23.119
for the rest of his life.

28:23.121 --> 28:26.389
But he will never re-gain
what he lost, Frank.

28:26.391 --> 28:29.159
When I think that my comments
could've contributed

28:29.161 --> 28:31.628
to this attack...

28:31.630 --> 28:33.630
could've contributed to someone

28:33.632 --> 28:37.000
experiencing the same kind of
pain I lived through...

28:37.002 --> 28:41.204
The attack on Officer Hayes
could've happened,

28:41.206 --> 28:43.006
whether you spoke out or not.

28:43.008 --> 28:46.242
Yeah, but I did
speak out, Frank.

28:46.244 --> 28:47.444
Partly because I was angry,

28:47.446 --> 28:49.379
and also so my enemies
wouldn't attack me.

28:49.381 --> 28:52.782
I never considered
the damage I could cause.

28:52.784 --> 28:55.952
You couldn't know
what would happen, Mr. Mayor.

28:55.954 --> 28:58.354
Frank, when I took this job,
I made a promise to myself

28:58.356 --> 29:00.590
to never put politics
above my responsibility

29:00.592 --> 29:02.625
to the people of this city.

29:02.627 --> 29:04.160
I broke that promise.

29:06.832 --> 29:09.065
I don't want you
to step down, Frank,

29:09.067 --> 29:12.202
because the next mayor
is gonna need your help.

29:15.373 --> 29:17.774
I've decided to resign.

29:29.741 --> 29:30.741
DANNY: You sure?

29:31.162 --> 29:33.095
Every single thing?

29:34.097 --> 29:35.964
All right.

29:35.966 --> 29:37.165
Yeah, thanks.

29:37.968 --> 29:39.067
Crime lab?

29:39.069 --> 29:40.101
Yep.

29:40.103 --> 29:41.303
Had them run everything we found

29:41.305 --> 29:43.438
in Santana's apartment
for glass shards.

29:43.440 --> 29:45.073
Blowback from the windshield
of Hayes' RMP.

29:45.075 --> 29:46.841
That's smart, Danny.

29:46.843 --> 29:48.743
Yeah, but unfortunately,
we came up empty.

29:48.745 --> 29:49.945
DA's not gonna charge him

29:49.947 --> 29:51.213
for resisting arrest,

29:51.215 --> 29:53.848
so Santana walks in a few hours,
and we got nothin'.

29:53.850 --> 29:55.550
Even if we put Santana
back on the street,

29:55.552 --> 29:57.652
the investigation isn't over.

29:57.654 --> 29:58.887
Eventually,
we're gonna nail him.

29:58.889 --> 30:00.021
Yeah, but by that time,

30:00.023 --> 30:02.324
he'll be banging mojitos
in Santo Domingo.

30:04.261 --> 30:05.660
What's that?

30:05.662 --> 30:07.529
TARU dug up a new piece
of surveillance tape

30:07.531 --> 30:08.964
from a taco joint
down the street

30:08.966 --> 30:10.198
from where Hayes was shot.

30:10.200 --> 30:11.566
Great, let's take a look at it

30:11.568 --> 30:13.802
and come up with more nothing.

30:19.042 --> 30:20.375
(Danny sighs heavily)

30:21.211 --> 30:22.210
Same as the other tape,

30:22.212 --> 30:24.246
there's nothing
we can I.D. Santana.

30:24.248 --> 30:25.747
Okay, okay, but hold on,
right there.

30:25.749 --> 30:27.115
Back it up a little bit.

30:30.254 --> 30:32.053
Can you zoom in?

30:35.292 --> 30:36.424
It's Gabby Castillo.

30:36.426 --> 30:37.993
That's the girl we talked
to at the newsstand.

30:37.995 --> 30:39.794
That's the girl we're
gonna talk to again.

30:41.498 --> 30:43.965
You work full-time in your
father's newsstand, Gabby?

30:43.967 --> 30:46.968
No, I take nursing
classes up at Hunter.

30:46.970 --> 30:48.803
It's a good school.
Look...

30:48.805 --> 30:52.240
I told you guys,
I didn't see that cop get shot.

30:52.242 --> 30:54.276
We know what you told us.

30:54.278 --> 30:55.777
And we also know

30:55.779 --> 30:57.345
what we see,

30:57.347 --> 30:59.914
and right here, I see you,

30:59.916 --> 31:01.883
staring right
at our shooter,

31:01.885 --> 31:03.852
just after he shot

31:03.854 --> 31:05.587
Officer Hayes.

31:05.589 --> 31:08.089
It happened really fast.

31:08.091 --> 31:09.391
And I was scared.

31:09.393 --> 31:10.859
Imagine how Officer Hayes felt.

31:10.861 --> 31:12.994
You guys don't understand.

31:12.996 --> 31:14.796
Try us.

31:14.798 --> 31:17.632
People in my neighborhood,
they don't trust the police.

31:17.634 --> 31:18.733
Like your father.

31:18.735 --> 31:20.368
If he knew I was here,

31:20.370 --> 31:22.404
he'd be really mad, yeah.

31:22.406 --> 31:23.972
Did your father

31:23.974 --> 31:25.540
raise you to tell the truth?

31:25.542 --> 31:27.175
It's not that simple.

31:27.177 --> 31:28.543
If I cooperate

31:28.545 --> 31:31.179
with you guys and
people find out...

31:31.181 --> 31:32.747
We can protect you.

31:32.749 --> 31:34.582
I'm not worried about myself.

31:34.584 --> 31:36.318
Then who are you worried about?

31:38.355 --> 31:41.156
My father came
here with nothing.

31:41.158 --> 31:43.258
He built his business
from nothing.

31:43.260 --> 31:45.260
If people think I snitched,

31:45.262 --> 31:47.796
they'll come after him.

31:49.800 --> 31:50.865
You know the shooter.

31:50.867 --> 31:53.435
This guy is gonna
shoot someone again.

31:53.437 --> 31:55.370
He will.

31:55.372 --> 31:57.806
Just you being here puts
you in danger with him.

31:57.808 --> 32:00.275
You want to protect yourself,
you want to protect your family,

32:00.277 --> 32:02.243
then you got to stop this guy.

32:02.245 --> 32:04.145
I'm gonna ask you again:

32:04.147 --> 32:07.248
Do you see the man
who shot Officer Hayes?

32:20.497 --> 32:22.664
Okay.

32:36.813 --> 32:37.879
What's going on?

32:37.881 --> 32:41.449
We traced the release
of the body-cam video

32:41.451 --> 32:43.518
to a server from
the courthouse.

32:43.520 --> 32:45.687
Do you know who leaked it?

32:45.689 --> 32:48.790
I think you owe us
all an explanation.

32:48.792 --> 32:51.259
When you released
a sealed piece

32:51.261 --> 32:53.228
of evidence, you betrayed this

32:53.230 --> 32:56.364
entire office, and damaged
the reputations of everyone

32:56.366 --> 32:57.432
who works here.

32:57.434 --> 32:59.033
I grew up in the neighborhood

32:59.035 --> 33:01.202
that Diego Perez was killed.

33:01.204 --> 33:03.571
Okay? I represented
those people

33:03.573 --> 33:04.572
as a Legal Aid attorney.

33:04.574 --> 33:06.641
They had a right
to see that video.

33:06.643 --> 33:08.576
They had a right
to decide for themselves

33:08.578 --> 33:10.478
if Officer Russell's
actions were justified.

33:10.480 --> 33:12.247
That was the judge's call,
not yours.

33:12.249 --> 33:13.415
(sighs)

33:13.417 --> 33:15.850
Our presentation to the
grand jury was one-sided,

33:15.852 --> 33:19.387
obviously representing the
pro-police bias of this office.

33:19.389 --> 33:20.955
We presented the facts

33:20.957 --> 33:23.391
and the grand jury
rendered its decision.

33:23.393 --> 33:24.959
You know damn well

33:24.961 --> 33:27.262
grand juries rarely
indict officers

33:27.264 --> 33:28.797
in line-of-duty shootings.

33:28.799 --> 33:30.665
Maybe that should change.

33:30.667 --> 33:32.367
That's a political argument.

33:33.336 --> 33:34.636
And you having a Hispanic

33:34.638 --> 33:37.238
ADA to sit second chair
in the death

33:37.240 --> 33:39.674
of a Hispanic victim
wasn't political?

33:39.676 --> 33:42.010
Prosecutors, defense attorneys,

33:42.012 --> 33:44.646
even defendants,
use ethnicity and gender

33:44.648 --> 33:46.748
to influence juries every

33:46.750 --> 33:48.516
single day--
that is the system.

33:48.518 --> 33:49.918
That's the way it works.

33:49.920 --> 33:52.454
You broke the law.

33:52.456 --> 33:54.956
Your employment
is terminated,

33:54.958 --> 33:56.491
effective immediately,

33:56.493 --> 33:59.360
and the DA will
personally pursue

33:59.362 --> 34:00.829
your disbarment.

34:00.831 --> 34:02.297
The judge has
issued a subpoena

34:02.299 --> 34:03.898
for you to appear.

34:03.900 --> 34:08.203
You will likely be charged
with criminal contempt.

34:08.938 --> 34:10.205
WOMAN:
Oh...

34:19.549 --> 34:23.985
I am sorry about what
happened with Officer Hayes.

34:25.889 --> 34:28.356
But I don't regret what I did.

34:30.060 --> 34:31.826
That's even worse.

34:58.154 --> 35:00.188
Frank.
Mr. Mayor,

35:00.190 --> 35:02.824
I wanted to come up personally
to tell you we just got

35:02.826 --> 35:05.159
a positive I.D.
on Miguel Santana

35:05.161 --> 35:07.128
for the shooting
of Officer Hayes.

35:07.130 --> 35:08.930
(sighs)
Has the DA brought charges?

35:08.932 --> 35:11.065
Attempted murder
of a police officer.

35:11.067 --> 35:13.034
It'll be announced
this afternoon.

35:13.036 --> 35:14.335
Well, if you're
worried about me

35:14.337 --> 35:15.937
holding a press conference...
I'm not.

35:17.307 --> 35:18.806
You think I've
given short shrift

35:18.808 --> 35:20.608
to the interests of the NYPD.

35:20.610 --> 35:22.377
At times.

35:22.379 --> 35:25.847
As I know I've thought, "Screw
city hall," a dozen times a day.

35:25.849 --> 35:29.217
Frank, I will not be
your boss much longer.

35:29.219 --> 35:31.753
Now's your chance.

35:31.755 --> 35:33.221
Tell me what you really think.

35:35.025 --> 35:37.292
Okay, I will.

35:37.294 --> 35:39.694
I don't think you
should step down.

35:39.696 --> 35:40.929
You're the only guy
at the One PP

35:40.931 --> 35:42.363
that feels that way.
Well...

35:42.365 --> 35:44.866
luckily, I'm the only
vote that matters.

35:44.868 --> 35:46.901
Look, your comments

35:46.903 --> 35:51.139
after the grand jury decision
were unfortunate, but...

35:51.141 --> 35:54.242
they weren't responsible
for getting Officer Hayes shot.

35:54.244 --> 35:56.277
How can you be sure?
Chronic offender like

35:56.279 --> 35:58.880
Miguel Santana doesn't
take his marching orders

35:58.882 --> 35:59.948
from the Mayor's Office.

35:59.950 --> 36:01.983
The death of Diego Perez

36:01.985 --> 36:03.718
was a time bomb,

36:03.720 --> 36:06.020
and that body-cam video

36:06.022 --> 36:08.556
going viral flicked the switch.

36:08.558 --> 36:10.291
Well, my comments
certainly didn't help.

36:10.293 --> 36:12.360
And in the wake of
that boy's death,

36:12.362 --> 36:16.197
my officers,
including Officer Hayes,

36:16.199 --> 36:18.566
they knew they were targets...

36:18.568 --> 36:20.735
but they still
manned their posts.

36:22.072 --> 36:24.806
They did not walk away.

36:24.808 --> 36:27.175
You think I'm taking
the easy way out.

36:28.445 --> 36:32.547
Oh... there's nothing
easy about your job.

36:32.549 --> 36:35.583
You do your best and a hundred
voices claim they could

36:35.585 --> 36:38.720
do it better, and at times,

36:38.722 --> 36:41.022
I have been one of those voices.

36:41.024 --> 36:43.625
And at times, the loudest.

36:44.494 --> 36:46.561
Look, you're gonna
do what you want,

36:46.563 --> 36:48.830
but you're a good man

36:48.832 --> 36:50.264
and a good mayor.

36:50.266 --> 36:53.267
(inhales, exhales)

36:53.269 --> 36:54.969
Thank you, Frank.

37:00.477 --> 37:04.479
But when the DA charges
Santana, there's gonna be

37:04.481 --> 37:06.748
a public outcry about
the double standard

37:06.750 --> 37:09.283
between police officers
and ordinary citizens.

37:09.285 --> 37:11.185
I know that.

37:11.187 --> 37:14.322
And after shooting off my mouth
the way I did, Frank...

37:16.393 --> 37:18.259
I just don't think
I'm the guy anymore

37:18.261 --> 37:20.662
to talk this city off the ledge.

37:22.198 --> 37:26.200
Actually, it makes you
exactly the right guy.

37:46.656 --> 37:48.089
Thought you could use one.

37:48.091 --> 37:50.124
You thought right.

37:50.126 --> 37:51.659
What time's the mayor come on?

37:51.661 --> 37:52.894
Ah, we got a couple minutes.

37:52.896 --> 37:53.861
DANNY:
Hopefully, he won't

37:53.863 --> 37:55.563
trash us like
he did last time.

37:55.565 --> 37:57.298
And what are
you doing here?

37:57.300 --> 37:59.734
I just came by to make sure
you didn't put a foot

37:59.736 --> 38:00.968
through the TV screen.

38:00.970 --> 38:03.771
Well, if it isn't his foot,
it'll be mine.

38:03.773 --> 38:04.806
I'm sure.

38:04.808 --> 38:05.740
I'm gonna grab a beer.

38:05.742 --> 38:06.974
(chuckles)

38:06.976 --> 38:08.976
Hey, make it two.

38:09.846 --> 38:10.845
Well!

38:10.847 --> 38:11.846
Hey!

38:11.848 --> 38:13.881
What do you think
he's gonna say?

38:14.984 --> 38:16.384
I have no idea.

38:16.386 --> 38:19.153
Pops off again, it'll be my
precinct that pays the price.

38:19.155 --> 38:21.923
You guys did a hell of a job
holding the fort down there.

38:21.925 --> 38:24.058
Amen to that.

38:24.060 --> 38:25.760
Thanks.

38:26.763 --> 38:29.564
What's up with all the cars
in the driveway?

38:32.035 --> 38:33.534
Okay.
What's this,

38:33.536 --> 38:36.204
a secret meeting of
the Reagan Boys Club?

38:36.206 --> 38:38.339
Oh, luckily,
you're a charter member.

38:39.476 --> 38:40.608
It's time.

38:43.113 --> 38:44.378
Here we go.
(sighs)

38:49.519 --> 38:51.219
Here, I got it on mute.

38:53.356 --> 38:54.856
POOLE:
Miguel Santana has been charged

38:54.858 --> 38:57.291
in the shooting of
NYPD Officer Mark Hayes.

38:57.293 --> 38:59.761
Now I know some of you
have expressed anger...

38:59.763 --> 39:01.462
because no charges were brought

39:01.464 --> 39:03.164
in the shooting death
of Diego Perez.

39:03.166 --> 39:05.566
I expressed, publicly,

39:05.568 --> 39:08.002
my own anger when that decision

39:08.004 --> 39:10.371
was handed down
from the grand jury.

39:10.373 --> 39:13.007
That was a mistake

39:13.009 --> 39:14.408
and I regret it.

39:15.779 --> 39:16.878
I'll be damned.

39:16.880 --> 39:19.013
POOLE: The death of Diego
Perez was a tragedy,

39:19.015 --> 39:20.948
but it was a tragedy
of his own making.

39:20.950 --> 39:23.718
The shooting death
of Officer Hayes

39:23.720 --> 39:25.820
was a cowardly act of vengeance.

39:25.822 --> 39:26.854
If Mr. Santana

39:26.856 --> 39:28.856
is guilty, then Mr. Santana

39:28.858 --> 39:30.758
deserves to be punished.

39:30.760 --> 39:33.828
But there's been enough
violence, and as your mayor,

39:33.830 --> 39:37.131
I urge everyone to remain calm

39:37.133 --> 39:39.033
and let our system work.

39:39.035 --> 39:41.135
Hmm!

39:41.137 --> 39:43.271
TV ANCHORMAN:
Mayor Poole commenting on the

39:43.273 --> 39:45.273
two shootings that have
triggered unrest in the city

39:45.275 --> 39:46.707
over the past few days.

39:46.709 --> 39:48.309
Not every day you see
a politician admit

39:48.311 --> 39:49.811
that he screwed up.
Would've been better

39:49.813 --> 39:52.380
if he'd kept his yap shut
in the first place, but...

39:52.382 --> 39:53.748
I'm not sure
you're qualified

39:53.750 --> 39:55.583
to preach about
self-restraint.

39:55.585 --> 39:57.018
Oh-ho.
She got you there.

39:57.020 --> 39:58.052
DANNY:
Well, if someone

39:58.054 --> 40:00.721
who worked for me
released the video,

40:00.723 --> 40:02.657
I probably wouldn't be
talking smack right now.

40:02.659 --> 40:05.393
Man made a mistake,
owned up to it.

40:05.395 --> 40:06.561
Took a lot of guts.

40:06.563 --> 40:08.095
JAMIE:
Almost makes me wonder

40:08.097 --> 40:09.864
if he got some
good career advice.

40:09.866 --> 40:12.633
Maybe from a certain PC?

40:15.505 --> 40:18.206
The last couple of days
could've been a whole lot worse

40:18.208 --> 40:20.908
without all the people
in this room.

40:23.012 --> 40:24.912
Hear, hear.

40:26.950 --> 40:29.717
Maybe I don't say it enough.

40:29.719 --> 40:31.786
I'm proud of you.

40:41.698 --> 40:44.265
I'm just sayin'.
