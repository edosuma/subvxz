00:02.403 --> 00:03.404
DADDY!

00:03.404 --> 00:05.136
(Emily) WHEN I WAS A CHILD,

00:05.136 --> 00:06.177
MY FATHER WAS FRAMED FOR
A CRIME HE DIDN'T COMMIT.

00:06.177 --> 00:07.038
YOU'RE MAKING A MISTAKE!
 DADDY!

00:07.038 --> 00:08.039
AMANDA!

00:08.039 --> 00:09.310
AMANDA CLARKE
NO LONGER EXISTS.

00:09.310 --> 00:12.012
BEFORE HE DIED,
HE LEFT A ROAD MAP FOR REVENGE

00:12.012 --> 00:14.485
THAT LED ME TO THE PEOPLE
WHO DESTROYED OUR LIVES.

00:14.485 --> 00:16.317
(Nolan) LYDIA DAVIS
IS ON TO YOU.

00:16.317 --> 00:18.049
WE HAVE TO GET OUR HANDS
ON THAT PHOTOGRAPH.

00:18.049 --> 00:19.190
(Declan) YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT IT TOOK FOR JACK

00:19.190 --> 00:20.291
TO PUT HIMSELF OUT THERE
FOR YOU.

00:20.291 --> 00:21.622
YOU LET HIM THINK
HE HAD A SHOT.

00:21.622 --> 00:23.794
CONRAD.

00:23.794 --> 00:25.156
(buzzer sounds)

00:25.156 --> 00:26.297
AMANDA CLARKE.

00:26.297 --> 00:27.328
SOME GUY NAMED FRANK
FIGURED OUT WE SWITCHED NAMES.

00:27.328 --> 00:28.399
WHERE IS HE?

00:28.399 --> 00:30.161
DON'T WORRY.
I TOOK CARE OF HIM.

00:31.532 --> 00:33.204
(Emily) THERE'S AN OLD SAYING

00:33.204 --> 00:35.066
ABOUT THOSE
WHO CANNOT REMEMBER THE PAST

00:35.066 --> 00:36.467
BEING CONDEMNED TO REPEAT IT.

00:36.467 --> 00:39.039
BUT THOSE OF US WHO REFUSE
TO FORGET THE PAST

00:39.039 --> 00:40.811
ARE CONDEMNED TO RELIVE IT.

00:40.811 --> 00:42.813
YOU'RE MAD AT ME,
AREN'T YOU?

00:42.813 --> 00:45.516
I'M A LOT OF THINGS
RIGHT NOW.

00:47.047 --> 00:48.579
THE GUY HAD IT OUT FOR YOU.

00:48.579 --> 00:49.580
I WAS PROTECTING YOU.

00:49.580 --> 00:51.222
YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO KILL HIM.

00:51.222 --> 00:54.125
THERE ARE OTHER WAYS
TO HANDLE THE SITUATION.

00:57.528 --> 01:00.161
I WAS EXPECTING
A BIT MORE GRATITUDE.

01:04.334 --> 01:07.138
(indistinct shouting)

01:07.138 --> 01:09.200
(both grunting)

01:09.200 --> 01:10.241
HAD ENOUGH?!

01:10.241 --> 01:11.272

01:17.848 --> 01:19.650

01:19.650 --> 01:21.152

01:21.152 --> 01:22.353
YOU FIGHT DIRTY.

OR WAS HE TOO BUSY
BLOWING UP PLANES?
 (grunts)

01:26.587 --> 01:28.659
I'M SORRY.

01:28.659 --> 01:30.591
I KNOW YOU WERE JUST
LOOKING OUT FOR ME.

01:30.591 --> 01:33.764
IT'S JUST A LOT TO PROCESS
AT 4:30 IN THE MORNING.

01:36.467 --> 01:38.269
THANK YOU.

01:45.776 --> 01:48.779
ED, OPEN UP.
I NEED TO TALK TO NOLAN.

01:50.381 --> 01:52.313
MR. ROSS IS ASLEEP.

01:52.313 --> 01:54.385
NO, HE ISN'T.

01:54.385 --> 01:56.247
HOW COULD HE BE? (chuckles)

01:56.247 --> 01:57.718
NEED ME TO STICK AROUND,
BOSS?

01:57.718 --> 02:01.392
NO. SHE'S DELIVERING
HER DAILY DOSE OF FRESH HELL

02:01.392 --> 02:02.593
EARLIER THAN USUAL.

02:02.593 --> 02:04.725
THANKS, ED. (sighs)

02:04.725 --> 02:07.127
IT'S THE CRACK OF YAK, EM.
SPIT IT OUT.

02:07.127 --> 02:09.460
I NEED YOU TO KEEP AN EYE
ON SOMEBODY FOR ME.

02:09.460 --> 02:12.303
OH, LITTLE OLD
FOR A BABYSITTER, NO?

02:12.303 --> 02:15.166
YOU'RE FUNNY. COOL HOUSE.

02:15.166 --> 02:17.168
THANKS.

02:17.168 --> 02:18.569
DOES MISS MANNERS
HAVE A NAME?

02:18.569 --> 02:20.411
THE LESS YOU KNOW,
THE BETTER.

02:20.411 --> 02:22.773
DO NOT LET HER
OUT OF YOUR SIGHT.

02:22.773 --> 02:24.375
DO YOU UNDERSTAND ME?
(sighs)

02:24.375 --> 02:27.278
I'LL BE BACK AS SOON AS I CAN.
YOU'LL BE SAFE HERE, OKAY?

02:27.278 --> 02:28.679
(blows kiss)

02:40.391 --> 02:42.263
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

02:42.263 --> 02:43.764
THE HEADACHE IS BETTER,

02:43.764 --> 02:45.766
BUT MY VISION'S
STILL BLURRED.

02:45.766 --> 02:48.299
STILL NO MEMORY ABOUT
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?

02:48.299 --> 02:50.170
WHOLE CHUNKS OF TIME

02:50.170 --> 02:51.302
SEEM TO BE MISSING.

02:51.302 --> 02:53.304
WELL, LET'S GET
YOUR BODY HEALED.

02:53.304 --> 02:55.276
IN MY EXPERIENCE,
THE MIND WILL FOLLOW.

02:56.747 --> 02:59.210

03:02.713 --> 03:05.185
LYDIA? IT'S VICTORIA.

03:05.185 --> 03:07.318
I KNOW WHO YOU ARE.

03:08.519 --> 03:10.391
I JUST DON'T KNOW
WHY YOU'RE HERE.

03:10.391 --> 03:12.923
I DON'T KNOW WHY I'M HERE.

03:12.923 --> 03:14.325
(people speaking indistinctly)

03:14.325 --> 03:15.866
WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED
TO ME?

03:15.866 --> 03:18.969
WELL, YOU JUST HAD
A NASTY FALL, SO...

03:18.969 --> 03:20.831
(woman)
MS. DAVIS NEEDS TO REST NOW,

03:20.831 --> 03:22.333
SO IF YOU TWO
WOULD FOLLOW ME.

03:22.333 --> 03:25.436
(woman speaking indistinctly
over p.a.)

03:28.409 --> 03:30.841
SHE HAS NO RECOLLECTION
OF HER FALL WHATSOEVER?

03:30.841 --> 03:33.213
WELL, MS. DAVIS SUSTAINED
A VERY SERIOUS BRAIN INJURY.

03:33.213 --> 03:34.845
IT'S POSSIBLE

03:34.845 --> 03:36.847
THE MEMORIES ASSOCIATED
WITH HER SUICIDE ATTEMPT

03:36.847 --> 03:38.449
ARE SIMPLY BEING SUPPRESSED.

03:38.449 --> 03:41.752
SO THERE'S STILL A POSSIBILITY
THEY COULD ALL COME BACK?

03:41.752 --> 03:44.325
OR JUST PIECES
OR NOT AT ALL.

03:44.325 --> 03:45.926
RIGHT NOW,
SHE NEEDS TIME TO HEAL

03:45.926 --> 03:47.798
AND EMOTIONAL SUPPORT,

03:47.798 --> 03:49.600
FAMILIAR SURROUNDINGS,

03:49.600 --> 03:53.604
UH, FRIENDS LIKE
THE TWO OF YOU.

03:53.604 --> 03:55.636
AND GIVEN THE PROPER CARE,
THERE'S NO REASON

03:55.636 --> 03:56.807
TO EXPECT ANYTHING OTHER

03:56.807 --> 03:59.270
THAN A FULL MENTAL
AND PHYSICAL RECOVERY.

04:08.979 --> 04:10.951
OH, IT'S A MIRACLE.

04:10.951 --> 04:12.683
WE NEED TO GET

17:39.429 --> 17:41.491
RIGHT. UH, WELL...

17:41.491 --> 17:44.334
THIS IS EMILY.

17:46.096 --> 17:47.297
LISTEN, IF YOU SEE NOLAN
BEFORE I DO,

17:47.297 --> 17:48.368
COULD YOU TELL HIM
TO POP BY THE BAR?

17:48.368 --> 17:51.301
I OWE HIM AN A--AN APOLOGY.

17:51.301 --> 17:52.342
YEAH, SURE.

17:52.342 --> 17:55.175
THANKS.

17:55.175 --> 17:57.207
WELL... IT WAS NICE
TO MEET YOU.

17:57.207 --> 17:59.709
LIKEWISE. (giggles)

17:59.709 --> 18:01.080
WHOEVER YOU ARE.

18:01.080 --> 18:02.452
(laughs)

18:07.817 --> 18:10.490
I BROUGHT YOU SOME CLOTHES.

18:10.490 --> 18:12.091
THANKS.

18:12.091 --> 18:15.495
SO THAT'S
THE FAMOUS JACK PORTER.

18:15.495 --> 18:17.327
ALL THE STORIES YOU TOLD ME
ABOUT HIM IN JUVIE,

18:17.327 --> 18:18.728
I FEEL LIKE...
(inhales sharply)

18:18.728 --> 18:19.869
I ALREADY KNOW HIM.

18:19.869 --> 18:22.202
GET INSIDE.
THIS ISN'T A GAME.

18:22.202 --> 18:24.674
I NEVER SAID IT WAS.

18:24.674 --> 18:26.176
AND IN CASE YOU FORGOT,

18:26.176 --> 18:27.677
I DON'T LIKE PEOPLE
TELLING ME WHAT TO DO.

18:30.180 --> 18:31.881
YOU'RE RIGHT.

18:31.881 --> 18:33.313
I'M SORRY.

18:33.313 --> 18:35.245
(inhales sharply)
LUCKY FOR YOU...

18:35.245 --> 18:37.387
(high-pitched voice)
I'M IN A GOOD MOOD.

18:46.726 --> 18:48.158
I'M GONNA TAKE CARE OF YOU--

18:48.158 --> 18:49.159
SET UP A BANK ACCOUNT
WITH MONTHLY DEPOSITS

18:49.159 --> 18:50.460
AND GET YOU A NEW IDENTITY

18:50.460 --> 18:53.163
SO YOU NEVER HAVE TO BE TIED
TO THE NAME AMANDA CLARKE AGAIN.

18:53.163 --> 18:55.705
BUT I LIKE
BEING AMANDA CLARKE.

18:55.705 --> 18:56.906
(clicking keyboard keys)

18:56.906 --> 18:58.438
IT'S OUR CONNECTION.

19:00.670 --> 19:04.244
YOU AND I
WILL ALWAYS BE CONNECTED.

19:04.244 --> 19:07.277
THEN WHY DO YOU WANT
TO SHIP ME OFF?

19:07.277 --> 19:10.420
(sighs) BECAUSE IT'S NOT
SAFE FOR YOU HERE.

19:10.420 --> 19:15.185
I COULDN'T LIVE WITH MYSELF
IF SOMETHING HAPPENED TO YOU.

19:15.185 --> 19:16.556
YOU CAN STAY
IN MY APARTMENT IN PARIS

19:16.556 --> 19:18.258
UNTIL I FIGURE OUT
THE LOGISTICS.

19:18.258 --> 19:20.460
YOU'LL LOVE IT THERE.

19:20.460 --> 19:23.193
YOU KNOW I'D DO THIS
FOR YOU ANYWAY,

19:23.193 --> 19:24.934
EVEN WITHOUT THE MONEY.

19:26.736 --> 19:29.899
YOU'RE THE CLOSEST THING
I EVER HAD TO A SISTER.

19:31.170 --> 19:32.602
ME, TOO.

19:35.445 --> 19:37.277
(Warden Stiles)
YOU ARE JUST ABOUT

19:37.277 --> 19:39.249
ONE BAD DAY AWAY
FROM SPENDING YOUR LIFE

19:39.249 --> 19:40.780
IN A PLACE LIKE THIS.

19:40.780 --> 19:42.482
WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE?

19:42.482 --> 19:46.216
I'M DAVID CLARKE'S DAUGHTER.

19:46.216 --> 19:48.187
I'M IN JAIL
NO MATTER WHERE I GO.

19:48.187 --> 19:50.490
SO YOU GOT A BAD DEAL.

19:50.490 --> 19:53.293
BUT YOU GOT SOMETHING ELSE
GOING FOR YOU.

19:53.293 --> 19:54.424
YOU'RE SMARTER
THAN MOST OF THESE GIRLS,

19:54.424 --> 19:57.196
ESPECIALLY EMILY THORNE.

19:57.196 --> 19:58.398
(buzzer sounds)

19:58.398 --> 20:00.800
(people speaking indistinctly)

20:00.800 --> 20:02.232
SCREW HER.

20:02.232 --> 20:03.673
OH, YOU WANT TO GO UP AGAINST
THE WHOLE WORLD?

20:03.673 --> 20:05.435
THAT'S YOUR BUSINESS.

20:05.435 --> 20:07.437
BUT VIOLENCE IS
A SHORTSIGHTED SOLUTION

20:07.437 --> 20:09.839
WHEN IT REALLY COMES
TO HANDLING YOUR ENEMIES.

20:09.839 --> 20:11.941
THERE'S BETTER WAYS
TO GO ABOUT IT.

20:11.941 --> 20:13.313
SMARTER WAYS.

20:13.313 --> 20:14.814
LIKE WHAT?

20:14.814 --> 20:18.217
I'M THINKING THAT ALL
EMILY'S REALLY LOOKING FOR

20:18.217 --> 20:20.219
IS A FRIEND.

20:20.219 --> 20:22.221
YOU GET HER TRUST,

20:22.221 --> 20:23.993
AND YOU'LL HAVE HER WORK

20:23.993 --> 20:25.995
FOR YOU
INSTEAD OF AGAINST YOU.

20:25.995 --> 20:27.997
OR YOU CAN GO ABOUT
THE REST OF YOUR LIFE

20:27.997 --> 20:32.402
WITH A BUSTED LIP
AND A BLOODY NOSE.

20:32.402 --> 20:34.734
UNDERSTAND WHAT I'M SAYING?

20:37.367 --> 20:39.008
(Victoria)
LET'S GET YOU UNPACKED, LYDIA.

20:39.008 --> 20:41.971
YOU MIGHT BE STAYING
A WHILE.

20:44.574 --> 20:46.616
DO YOU REMEMBER
THE GIRLS' TRIP

20:46.616 --> 20:49.248
WE TOOK TO POSITANO
LAST WINTER?

20:49.248 --> 20:52.251
I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM
REMEMBERING LAST WINTER.

20:52.251 --> 20:55.785
IT'S THE PAST FEW WEEKS
THAT ARE GONE.

20:55.785 --> 20:57.757
SO YOU DON'T REMEMBER
HOW I FOUND OUT

20:57.757 --> 21:00.259
ABOUT YOUR RELATIONSHIP
WITH CONRAD

21:00.259 --> 21:02.462
AT MY MEMORIAL DAY PARTY?

21:02.462 --> 21:04.664
VICTORIA...

21:05.735 --> 21:09.339
DO YOU RECOGNIZE THIS?

21:09.339 --> 21:11.371
"LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,

21:11.371 --> 21:13.002
"EVERYONE HERE TONIGHT
IS A VICTIM--

21:13.002 --> 21:15.274
"A VICTIM OF FRAUD
AND DECEIT.

21:15.274 --> 21:17.307
"THE RUTHLESS MONSTERS
RESPONSIBLE--

21:17.307 --> 21:20.279
VICTORIA AND CONRAD GRAYSON."

21:20.279 --> 21:21.511
I WROTE THIS?

21:21.511 --> 21:22.652
AND YOU WERE
PREPARED TO READ IT

21:22.652 --> 21:23.853
AT THE OPEN ARMS BENEFIT

21:23.853 --> 21:25.855
THE NIGHT THAT YOU
FELL OVER YOUR BALCONY.

21:25.855 --> 21:27.056
(sighs)

21:27.056 --> 21:28.418
WHY WOULD I?

21:28.418 --> 21:29.919
WELL, THE IMPORTANT THING

21:29.919 --> 21:32.762
IS THAT YOU DIDN'T
GO THROUGH WITH IT.

21:32.762 --> 21:34.023
HEY, ASH. HOW'S IT GOING?

21:34.023 --> 21:37.427
APPARENTLY, VICTORIA MISTOOK
MY PARTY PLANNING EXPERIENCE

21:37.427 --> 21:39.369
FOR AN INTERNSHIP AT U-HAUL.

21:39.369 --> 21:40.530
OH, HERE.
LET ME HELP YOU.

21:40.530 --> 21:42.332
THANK YOU,
BUT I DON'T NEED HELP.

21:42.332 --> 21:44.033
I NEED A NEW JOB.

21:44.033 --> 21:45.375
I THOUGHT
THAT WORKING FOR VICTORIA

21:45.375 --> 21:46.536
WAS WHAT YOU ALWAYS WANTED.

21:46.536 --> 21:48.037
NO, A LIFE LIKE YOURS
IS WHAT I ALWAYS WANTED.

21:48.037 --> 21:49.839
THIS IS JUST EMBARRASSING.

21:49.839 --> 21:52.942
NOT THAT
YOU WOULD UNDERSTAND.

22:00.550 --> 22:01.851
THIS IS ALMOST
THE LAST OF IT.

22:01.851 --> 22:04.053
ASHLEY, WOULD YOU
GIVE US A MOMENT, PLEASE?

22:04.053 --> 22:06.856
WITH PLEASURE.

22:10.560 --> 22:12.061
HELLO, VICTORIA.

22:12.061 --> 22:13.062
HELLO, LYDIA.

22:13.062 --> 22:14.434
I WENT THROUGH THE HOUSE
TO MAKE SURE

22:14.434 --> 22:16.706
THERE WERE NO KEEPSAKES
THAT STILL BELONGED TO YOU.

22:16.706 --> 22:18.107
BUT, UM...

22:18.107 --> 22:20.410
IF YOU'RE MISSING ANYTHING,
JUST LET ME KNOW.

22:20.410 --> 22:21.911
I'LL HAVE
ANOTHER LOOK AROUND.

22:21.911 --> 22:23.413
THAT'S VERY SWEET OF YOU.

22:23.413 --> 22:24.944
WELL,
I WANT LYDIA TO REMEMBER

22:24.944 --> 22:27.547
ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING
THAT SHE'S FORGOTTEN.

22:27.547 --> 22:29.649
OH, WELL, THAT'S ALL
ANY OF US COULD WANT.

22:29.649 --> 22:31.481
(chuckles)

22:31.481 --> 22:33.823
YOU'RE LUCKY TO HAVE
A FRIEND LIKE VICTORIA.

22:33.823 --> 22:35.525
GET WELL SOON.

22:39.128 --> 22:40.960
WHAT IS IT?

22:40.960 --> 22:42.832
THERE'S A PHOTOGRAPH.

22:42.832 --> 22:44.133
OF WHOM?

22:44.133 --> 22:45.395
THE TWO OF US.

22:45.395 --> 22:48.137
IT'S FROM
YOUR NEW YEAR'S PARTY IN 2003.

22:48.137 --> 22:49.639
SHE'S THERE.

22:49.639 --> 22:51.000
EMILY?

22:51.000 --> 22:52.542
OH, NO.
THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

22:52.542 --> 22:55.144
NO ONE KNEW ANYTHING ABOUT
THIS GIRL UNTIL THIS SUMMER.

22:55.144 --> 22:57.647
THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT SHE
DIDN'T KNOW WHO WE WERE.

22:57.647 --> 23:00.810
IF YOU FIND THE PICTURE,
I CAN PROVE IT.

23:04.414 --> 23:05.915
HEY.

23:05.915 --> 23:08.157
I CAN'T STAND THAT WOMAN.

23:08.157 --> 23:11.020
(sighs)
WHAT'D SHE DO NOW?

23:11.020 --> 23:13.523
IT'S NOT WHAT SHE'S DONE.
IT'S WHO SHE IS.

23:13.523 --> 23:16.125
PEOPLE LIKE US ARE DISPOSABLE
TO PEOPLE LIKE THEM.

23:16.125 --> 23:17.827
NO KIDDING.

23:17.827 --> 23:19.899
I'VE BUSTED MY ASS TO TRY
TO GET IN GOOD WITH CONRAD,

23:19.899 --> 23:21.531
AND ALL THAT FLIES
RIGHT OUT THE WINDOW

23:21.531 --> 23:23.603
THE MINUTE THE PRODIGAL SON
WALTZES BACK IN.

23:23.603 --> 23:25.575
MM. DON'T EVEN GET ME
STARTED ON EMILY.

23:25.575 --> 23:26.876
HMM.

23:26.876 --> 23:29.539
YOU KNOW SHE'S THE WORST
OF THEM ALL, RIGHT?

23:29.539 --> 23:31.180
I MEAN, AT LEAST VICTORIA
WILL LOOK YOU IN THE EYE

23:31.180 --> 23:33.082
AND TELL YOU
YOU'RE NOT GOOD ENOUGH.

23:33.082 --> 23:35.485
BUT EMILY WILL JUST
THINK IT

23:35.485 --> 23:38.748
AND HIDE BEHIND THAT
CONDESCENDING SMILE OF HERS.

23:38.748 --> 23:40.419
OUR PROBLEM IS,

23:40.419 --> 23:43.893
WE'VE BEEN PLAYING
WAY TOO NICE.

23:43.893 --> 23:46.055
I'LL CHEERS TO THAT.

23:46.055 --> 23:47.527
CHEERS.

23:49.599 --> 23:51.461
(Ed) HEY, BOSS.
 HMM?

23:51.461 --> 23:54.864
LOOKS LIKE YOUR GUY
GOT HIS HEAD BASHED IN.

23:54.864 --> 23:57.467
WHAT GUY?

23:57.467 --> 23:58.838
FRANK?

23:58.838 --> 24:00.570
HOLY...

24:01.871 --> 24:04.213
(exhales)

24:07.146 --> 24:10.480
SO THE POLICE THINK
THAT FRANK

24:10.480 --> 24:12.482
WAS A VICTIM OF
ROBBERY-CARJACKING.

24:12.482 --> 24:13.653
WELL, MAYBE THAT'S EXACTLY

24:13.653 --> 24:15.184
WHAT THE MURDERER
WANTS THEM TO THINK.

24:15.184 --> 24:17.887
WELL, IT DIDN'T SOUND
PREMEDITATED.

24:17.887 --> 24:20.189
THEY SAY HE WAS IN
A ROUGH PART OF TOWN,

24:20.189 --> 24:21.661
FLUSH WITH CASH,

24:21.661 --> 24:22.892
PROBABLY FROM
THE SEVERANCE CHECK.

24:22.892 --> 24:24.534
FRANK CALLED ME
THE NIGHT HE DIED.

24:24.534 --> 24:26.195
AND THE LAST THING HE SAID
WAS THAT EMILY THORNE

24:26.195 --> 24:28.237
IS NOT WHO SHE CLAIMS
TO BE.

24:28.237 --> 24:30.500
WELL, WHAT COULD SHE POSSIBLY
HAVE TO DO WITH ANY OF THIS?

24:30.500 --> 24:32.542
I HAD HIM INVESTIGATE HER.

24:32.542 --> 24:34.243
I THINK HE STUMBLED
ONTO SOMETHING.

24:34.243 --> 24:36.075
AND SHE KILLED HIM?

24:36.075 --> 24:39.208
I THINK MAYBE YOUR IMAGINATION
IS GETTING THE BETTER OF YOU.

24:39.208 --> 24:43.482
THAT WOMAN IS DATING
OUR SON.

24:43.482 --> 24:44.483
(cell phone beeps)

24:44.483 --> 24:46.556
I'M NOT GOING TO TAKE
THAT CHANCE.

24:46.556 --> 24:48.017
WHO ARE YOU CALLING?

24:48.017 --> 24:49.619
THE POLICE.

24:51.521 --> 24:53.262
LET'S PLAY A GAME

24:53.262 --> 24:55.865
OF 20 QUESTIONS.

24:57.166 --> 24:59.929
I DON'T LIKE GAMES.

25:01.531 --> 25:03.102
SURE YOU DO.

25:03.102 --> 25:05.134
YOU EVER HEARD OF A GUY

25:05.134 --> 25:08.237
NAMED FRANK STEVENS?

25:08.237 --> 25:10.540
SORRY.

25:10.540 --> 25:12.281
HERE'S A CLUE--

25:12.281 --> 25:13.683
HE'S DEAD.

25:16.245 --> 25:17.947
(scoffs)

25:17.947 --> 25:21.190
THESE ARE BLOOD STAINS
ON YOUR CLOTHES.

25:34.864 --> 25:37.036
WHO THE HELL ARE YOU?

25:46.015 --> 25:47.176
WHAT'S GOING ON?

25:47.176 --> 25:48.578
THIS WASN'T PART OF THE PLAN.

25:48.578 --> 25:51.020
YEAH, NEITHER WAS AIDING
AND ABETTING YOUR EVIL TWIN.

25:51.020 --> 25:53.282
YOU'VE GOT SOME EXPLAINING
TO DO.

25:54.854 --> 25:56.225
WHAT DID YOU TELL HIM?

25:56.225 --> 25:57.857
HE FIGURED
MOST OF IT OUT HIMSELF.

25:57.857 --> 25:59.028
HE'S SMART.

25:59.028 --> 26:00.189
SOMETHING
YOU'VE CLEARLY FORGOTTEN.

26:00.189 --> 26:02.592
I DO A LOT OF
QUESTIONABLE THINGS, EMS,

26:02.592 --> 26:04.193
BUT HARBORING
CAPITAL MURDERERS--

26:04.193 --> 26:05.294
NOT ONE OF THEM.

26:05.294 --> 26:07.196
(scoffs) IT'S NOT LIKE
THE GUY WAS A CHOIR BOY.

26:07.196 --> 26:08.638
HE TRACKED ME DOWN.

26:08.638 --> 26:10.139
SHE WOULD'VE DONE
THE EXACT SAME THING--

26:10.139 --> 26:11.871
LA, LA, LA, LA, LA, LA,
LA, LA, LA, LA, LA.

26:11.871 --> 26:13.673
LOOK, I'M NOT BUILT
FOR PRISON TIME.

26:13.673 --> 26:15.645
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO
WHEN THE COPS COME?
 GIVE THEM MY ALIBI.

26:15.645 --> 26:16.646
WHAT ABOUT HER?

26:16.646 --> 26:17.807
(exhales)

26:17.807 --> 26:19.909
AMANDA'S ON A FLIGHT
TO PARIS TONIGHT.

26:23.112 --> 26:25.114
I NEED YOU TO DISABLE
THE GPS IN THIS

26:25.114 --> 26:27.016
SO I CAN TURN IT ON
WITHOUT SENDING A SIGNAL.

26:27.016 --> 26:29.188
I HAVE TO ERASE WHAT'S ON IT
BEFORE I GET RID OF IT.

26:29.188 --> 26:30.720
TELL ME THAT'S NOT
FRANK'S PHONE.

26:30.720 --> 26:32.992
YOU ALREADY KNOW
THE ANSWER TO THAT.

26:32.992 --> 26:36.065
THISIS ONLY TO SAVE
MY OWN ASS.

26:36.065 --> 26:38.267
HAPPY TRAILS, AMANDA.

26:41.330 --> 26:44.133
NEVER MIND HIM.

26:44.133 --> 26:46.706
COME ON. LET ME
TAKE YOU TO THE AIRPORT.

26:48.978 --> 26:50.609
KARA WILKINS?

26:50.609 --> 26:53.713
THAT'S MY MOTHER'S NAME.

26:53.713 --> 26:56.345
I THOUGHT IT WAS APPROPRIATE.

26:56.345 --> 26:59.148
YOU KNOW I'VE NEVER EVEN
LEFT THE STATES?

26:59.148 --> 27:00.920
NOT EVEN CANADA
OR MEXICO.

27:00.920 --> 27:03.052
AND NOW YOU CAN GO
WHEREVER YOU WANT.

27:03.052 --> 27:04.954
IT DOESN'T EVEN NEED
TO BE PARIS.

27:04.954 --> 27:06.926
COME WITH ME.

27:10.199 --> 27:12.702
I WISH I COULD.

27:20.069 --> 27:23.072
(footsteps approaching)

27:24.714 --> 27:25.875
DAD.

27:25.875 --> 27:28.147
HEY, CHARLIE.

27:28.147 --> 27:29.979
YOU'RE A WELCOME SIGHT.

27:29.979 --> 27:32.081

WHERE WERE YOU ON THE NIGHT
THAT FRANK DIED?

37:31.880 --> 37:34.723
YOU REALLY THINK I'M CAPABLE
OF COLD-BLOODED MURDER?

37:34.723 --> 37:36.355
I THINK
IT'S BEEN ESTABLISHED

37:36.355 --> 37:37.986
THAT YOU'RE
CAPABLE OF ANYTHING.

37:37.986 --> 37:40.959
YEAH, AND FRANK PROVED HIMSELF
MORE LOYAL TO YOU THAN TO ME.

37:40.959 --> 37:44.633
AND HE EVEN SO MUCH AS ADMITTED
TRYING TO KILL LYDIA FOR YOU.

37:44.633 --> 37:46.795
AND YOU PRACTICALLY REJOICED
WHEN YOU FOUND OUT HE WAS DEAD.

37:46.795 --> 37:48.867
YOU KNEW HE HAD FEELINGS
FOR ME,

37:48.867 --> 37:50.899
AND YOU WERE TERRIFIED
THAT THEY MIGHT BE MUTUAL.

37:50.899 --> 37:53.472
DON'T FLATTER YOURSELF.

37:53.472 --> 37:55.874

LYDIA,

38:17.666 --> 38:20.068
ARE YOU AWAKE?

38:39.348 --> 38:40.819
(door closes)

38:53.832 --> 38:55.904

38:55.904 --> 38:57.806

39:14.923 --> 39:15.984
(chuckles)

39:15.984 --> 39:17.856
I CHANGED A FEW THINGS

39:17.856 --> 39:19.888
WHEN I FOUND OUT
THAT MY DAD DIED.

39:19.888 --> 39:21.930
I HEARD.

39:21.930 --> 39:23.392

WHAT PEOPLE THINK?

39:45.514 --> 39:48.957

PRETENDED TO BE IN THERE.

39:48.957 --> 39:50.659
