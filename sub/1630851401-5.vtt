WEBVTT

00:26.640 --> 00:28.480
Wanna tell me what's happening?

00:29.360 --> 00:30.720
Ragna is our voice.

00:30.800 --> 00:33.800
Explain to me what she's doing
in the fucking trunk of a car.

00:36.680 --> 00:37.480
What's that?

00:37.560 --> 00:41.360
A photograph taken by a speed
control camera on our way here.

00:42.360 --> 00:45.320
How do you know that?
This could be old. From anywhere.

00:45.400 --> 00:48.400
I have a source at the very top
of the Innenministerium.

00:48.480 --> 00:49.840
The Scorpio.

00:49.920 --> 00:51.880
So I know it was taken
on the way here.

00:51.960 --> 00:54.800
That's why we're going to find out
who's leaking information.

00:54.880 --> 00:57.440
-But Ragna...
-Ragna was the last one to join us.

00:57.520 --> 00:59.520
Only an idiot wouldn't suspect her.

01:00.680 --> 01:03.000
Or someone who can
no longer see clearly.

01:11.720 --> 01:14.200
Your catholic god
needs your confession.

01:14.280 --> 01:16.920
As you said, faith is never enough.

01:33.120 --> 01:34.320
Jan?

01:34.400 --> 01:35.400
Untie him.

01:38.400 --> 01:39.600
Everybody listen.

01:40.200 --> 01:41.800
Come closer, please.

01:42.800 --> 01:47.400
You all have been carefully selected
and trained for a very long time.

01:48.360 --> 01:51.840
Everyone agreed on waiting
for our moment to come.

01:51.920 --> 01:55.200
To fulfill our duty for our country,
even to give our life for it.

01:56.640 --> 02:00.600
Everyone...
except the rat among us.

02:08.280 --> 02:10.560
The police has my photograph.

02:10.640 --> 02:14.840
And a name only very few of you
know me by.

02:22.960 --> 02:25.240
She was the last one to join us.

02:28.080 --> 02:32.200
Chris was responsible for our safety
while I was gone.

02:33.960 --> 02:35.560
And you, my dear Daniel...

02:37.920 --> 02:39.960
You controlled our accounts.

02:41.560 --> 02:44.640
Since the cyber currency
also has been compromised,

02:44.720 --> 02:47.440
I'd kindly ask you to join them.

02:47.520 --> 02:49.960
-What?
-He's not a traitor.

02:50.040 --> 02:52.240
All the better.
Then he has nothing to fear.

02:52.320 --> 02:53.960
I didn't do anything.

04:02.440 --> 04:05.800
Turns out he wasn't as innocent
as we thought, though.

04:05.880 --> 04:08.720
They found evidence on his phone
connecting him to the cell,

04:08.800 --> 04:10.200
but still...

04:10.280 --> 04:12.200
he was a child.

04:12.280 --> 04:14.760
Anyway, you got my message?

04:14.840 --> 04:17.320
Yes. You found the name Brehme

04:17.400 --> 04:20.520
in a case about
financing right-wing propaganda.

04:20.600 --> 04:21.960
Do you know who he is?

04:22.040 --> 04:25.440
No, not yet.
But we are looking into it.

04:25.520 --> 04:27.720
Have you had contact with your agent?

04:28.640 --> 04:32.480
No. We're tracking the IP of
the last communication as we speak.

04:34.000 --> 04:36.480
You'll meet Asgeir later today then.
Good.

04:39.320 --> 04:41.280
-Hi.
-Hi.

04:44.960 --> 04:45.840
So?

04:48.080 --> 04:49.800
Furia is in Germany.

04:51.920 --> 04:52.920
Shit.

04:57.840 --> 04:59.520
What does Berlin say?

05:01.440 --> 05:04.000
You think we have
jurisdictional challenges.

05:04.080 --> 05:08.600
In Germany they have 16 states, all
arguing over who gets to know more.

05:08.680 --> 05:11.640
The guy who had
your job over there...

05:11.720 --> 05:14.560
had to resign
because of right-wing sympathies.

05:14.640 --> 05:16.080
Have you informed them?

05:19.240 --> 05:20.840
You must inform them, Inger.

05:20.920 --> 05:24.320
I have made contact unofficially with
the best I know over there.

05:24.400 --> 05:26.480
-Someone we both can trust.
-Ok.

05:28.000 --> 05:29.480
Then what's your plan?

05:30.760 --> 05:33.920
Inger, you drag me into your mess,
I have to know what your plan is.

05:35.160 --> 05:37.920
We work through my contact
until Furia is located.

05:38.000 --> 05:40.840
We keep her identity secret,
until she points us to Cato.

05:40.920 --> 05:43.920
Then my contact sends in her cavalry.

05:44.000 --> 05:45.720
Who's your contact?

05:45.800 --> 05:47.160
Kathi Falke.

05:47.720 --> 05:49.080
Never heard of her.

05:50.040 --> 05:53.400
I worked with her four years ago
when she was state prosecutor.

05:53.480 --> 05:54.760
I trust her completely.

05:58.600 --> 05:59.880
There's one more thing.

06:00.680 --> 06:01.680
What's that?

06:02.760 --> 06:03.800
I have to...

06:04.720 --> 06:08.280
I need you to get in touch with
the Americans and EST.

06:08.360 --> 06:13.000
Get me all intelligence on
a Russian mob leader, Ziminov.

06:13.080 --> 06:16.280
-Why? Isn't that the guy who...
-Yes.

06:16.360 --> 06:18.000
I need everything they have on him.

06:18.080 --> 06:21.360
-They never caught him, why risk...
-Because I need it.

06:21.920 --> 06:24.760
You really don't want to
know any more this point.

06:47.840 --> 06:48.840
You too.

08:12.960 --> 08:13.920
Hi.

08:14.000 --> 08:17.080
You didn't answer the phone.
Is everything okay?

08:17.160 --> 08:19.600
Everything's fine.
Kirsten made a delicious breakfast.

08:19.680 --> 08:22.960
Things are great.
She's happy and smiling. All is well.

08:26.040 --> 08:26.840
1 NEW MESSAGE

08:26.920 --> 08:28.920
MEET KATHI AT CAFÉ FAUST AT 1700
INGER

08:29.560 --> 08:31.520
You're not gonna be late for school?

08:32.480 --> 08:34.320
Asgeir, relax. It's going great.

08:38.560 --> 08:41.040
The x-rays didn't really scare Chris.

08:41.800 --> 08:43.120
It didn't make him talk.

08:43.200 --> 08:46.120
Then we just have to question him
a little less subtly.

08:48.840 --> 08:52.440
I suggest you become a part of them.

08:56.960 --> 08:58.880
And stir the shit a little, yeah?

08:58.960 --> 09:01.280
-One hit.
-Where?

09:07.480 --> 09:08.720
Shit!

09:08.800 --> 09:09.800
Show me.

09:13.160 --> 09:14.160
Yes.

09:35.680 --> 09:37.160
What are you doing here?

09:38.880 --> 09:40.240
I want to know how you are.

09:41.360 --> 09:42.160
Good.

09:42.240 --> 09:45.240
Because of the dead boy.
I know you take this very seriously.

09:46.040 --> 09:47.720
How else should I take this?

09:48.600 --> 09:51.680
I just want you to know...
I'm here.

09:51.760 --> 09:53.720
Yes, I can see that.
Thank you, Ruben.

09:54.240 --> 09:56.440
I'm in a hurry.

10:01.200 --> 10:03.120
How did you even get in here?

10:03.200 --> 10:06.240
I don't have a key,
if that's what you mean.

10:06.320 --> 10:08.480
Ms. Wilberg was on her way out
with her dog.

10:11.240 --> 10:15.160
Tell me, why do you never
answer when I call you?

10:15.240 --> 10:17.200
-Must I?
-Yes. You must.

10:17.280 --> 10:19.040
When we have the same employer.

10:22.320 --> 10:25.080
We want to get along with each other.

10:25.160 --> 10:27.760
Or do you want stress
in your private life?

10:27.840 --> 10:30.840
I thought you don't have time for
private life, it slows you down.

10:30.920 --> 10:32.840
Did you take notes,
or does it still hurt?

10:32.920 --> 10:34.920
-What a shitty line.
-I'm sorry.

10:35.000 --> 10:36.880
Ok, so what?
What do you want?

10:37.800 --> 10:41.560
The headline "Dead Muslim Child" will
continue to be the top media topic.

10:41.640 --> 10:45.000
Understandable. People don't want
children killed in police operations,

10:45.080 --> 10:46.520
no matter where they come from.

10:47.720 --> 10:50.040
Did you get up on the wrong
side of the bed today?

10:50.880 --> 10:52.600
We need to prepare a statement.

10:52.680 --> 10:54.160
No, you need to do it.

10:54.240 --> 10:55.800
It would help if your people

10:55.880 --> 10:59.280
released a few more details about
the terrorist attack that was foiled.

10:59.360 --> 11:01.080
You arrested Islamists.

11:01.160 --> 11:04.600
Two terrorists. That's the story.
That's the truth we prefer.

11:04.680 --> 11:06.400
"The truth we prefer"?

11:06.960 --> 11:09.000
Well, call it a political signal.

11:09.080 --> 11:11.400
I don't have time for
your beauty pageant.

11:11.480 --> 11:14.640
That "beauty pageant"
is the federal election.

11:14.720 --> 11:16.640
If the NAD really wins the election,

11:16.720 --> 11:20.120
-you will have a lot of time.
-What's that supposed to mean?

11:20.200 --> 11:23.680
Come on. People are afraid of
an Islamist terrorist attack.

11:23.760 --> 11:25.520
And we just prevented one.

11:25.600 --> 11:27.720
We need to demonstrate
our successes now.

11:27.800 --> 11:30.760
Otherwise we risk losing votes.
We need to win this election.

11:30.840 --> 11:33.200
Ok. You make sure that Hardenberg
is in good shape.

11:33.280 --> 11:35.000
I'll take care of counter-terrorism.

11:35.080 --> 11:38.320
As long as we don't know what this
Islamist terrorist cell is all about,

11:38.400 --> 11:40.880
we'll continue to say that
we are still investigating.

11:42.120 --> 11:43.680
-I have to go.
-Kathi.

11:57.400 --> 11:58.960
-Who are you?
-Who are you?

11:59.040 --> 12:00.920
-I'm not telling you shit!
-He's right.

12:01.800 --> 12:03.920
Who are you? Tell us who you are!

12:04.000 --> 12:07.440
You shouldn't worry about me.
One of you guys fucked something up.

12:07.520 --> 12:09.000
That's why you're here.

12:11.040 --> 12:13.360
I told you before, leave me alone!

12:14.080 --> 12:15.320
Go in there!

12:22.040 --> 12:24.440
Chris, you should start
confessing now!

12:26.480 --> 12:27.880
Am I in here

12:27.960 --> 12:31.680
because I did all the work for you
that you then gave the cops?

12:31.760 --> 12:33.160
-Or are you a cop?
-No.

12:33.240 --> 12:34.520
Chris, are you a cop?

12:35.280 --> 12:36.520
Are you scared of me?

12:37.520 --> 12:39.600
-Are you scared of me?
-Stop it!

12:39.680 --> 12:40.480
Where were you

12:40.560 --> 12:43.000
-the night before last?
-I was at home! At home!

12:43.080 --> 12:44.760
With your wife? Was it good?

12:48.680 --> 12:49.680
You're lying.

12:50.840 --> 12:52.840
You've always been a liar, Chris.

12:52.920 --> 12:56.440
You know, I was with your wife.
And it was good. Very good.

13:00.520 --> 13:03.280
You shouldn't worry too much
about such little things now.

13:04.080 --> 13:06.920
You have other problems now.
Do you understand that?

13:17.840 --> 13:18.840
Morning.

13:21.600 --> 13:23.600
Sorry I'm late. Good morning.

13:23.680 --> 13:24.680
Morning.

13:25.240 --> 13:28.240
They want to make a PR campaign
out of the Safar brothers.

13:28.320 --> 13:30.920
Really? When I worked
in Verfassungsschutz,

13:31.000 --> 13:33.040
this would never have happened.

13:33.120 --> 13:36.040
-There was no Twitter then either.
-Right.

13:37.360 --> 13:39.320
-What did he say exactly?
-Who?

13:39.400 --> 13:41.520
Your ex. The master of mass media!

13:42.160 --> 13:46.880
He wants us to publish details from
the investigation. What is this?

13:47.640 --> 13:49.480
That's the bad news of the day.

13:49.560 --> 13:53.000
We have now fully evaluated
the Safar brothers' phones.

13:53.080 --> 13:54.880
The list of people we've identified

13:54.960 --> 13:56.920
as part of the brothers'
terrorist network.

14:00.600 --> 14:02.560
That's twelve men all over Germany.

14:04.800 --> 14:08.400
So we have a terrorist network
that stretches across Germany,

14:08.480 --> 14:11.600
and is in possession of explosives,
and we had no idea about it?

14:12.640 --> 14:13.920
That is correct.

14:14.000 --> 14:17.520
And we don't know when and where
there'd be an attack. How can it be?

14:17.600 --> 14:18.880
We don't know yet.

14:18.960 --> 14:21.440
The Safar brothers have been
questioned for hours,

14:21.520 --> 14:23.680
but nothing has come up yet.

14:23.760 --> 14:25.200
Then we have to talk to them.

14:26.600 --> 14:28.720
Sorry, Helmut.
We'll come back to you...

14:28.800 --> 14:32.120
Excuse me,
I only have one short thing.

14:32.200 --> 14:33.800
-Have you found your informant?
-No.

14:33.880 --> 14:36.480
But we were able look more closely
at the cryptocurrency.

14:36.560 --> 14:40.040
We have several leads to
financial institutions in Frankfurt,

14:40.120 --> 14:42.560
but we are certain that
the money is coming from here.

14:43.880 --> 14:45.400
-A Russian company?
-Yes.

14:45.480 --> 14:50.560
A Russian oligarch with ties
to Putin and the Russian mafia.

14:50.640 --> 14:51.920
His name is Ziminov.

14:52.000 --> 14:54.680
He was also involved in Brexit
and in the last US elections.

14:54.760 --> 14:57.200
He'll be arrested
the minute he steps onto US soil.

14:57.280 --> 15:01.080
And now this organization has
its eyes on our upcoming election.

15:01.160 --> 15:04.200
They finance the NAD and want
Rudolf Hensel as Chancellor.

15:04.280 --> 15:05.800
They're destabilizing Europe,

15:05.880 --> 15:09.240
and are financing even more
radical right-wing extremist groups,

15:09.320 --> 15:11.480
including the one
our informant has infiltrated.

15:11.560 --> 15:13.360
And... can we go to the next one?

15:13.440 --> 15:17.000
This is... Vito Morelli.

15:17.080 --> 15:18.360
A private banker

15:18.440 --> 15:21.800
who is responsible for the crypto
transactions here in Germany.

15:21.880 --> 15:23.640
-Is he under surveillance?
-Yes.

15:23.720 --> 15:25.120
But he suspects something.

15:25.200 --> 15:27.320
He's closing up shop.
Covering his tracks.

15:27.920 --> 15:32.040
But he may lead us to the group,
and my undercover agent.

15:32.120 --> 15:33.440
Then have him arrested.

15:35.800 --> 15:37.080
On what grounds?

15:38.240 --> 15:41.080
National security charges.
Question him.

15:42.320 --> 15:44.400
Excuse me. We're in the middle
of a meeting.

15:44.480 --> 15:45.960
I know. Sorry.

15:47.160 --> 15:50.360
The minister is about to meet
the press. Any new findings?

15:50.920 --> 15:52.840
In the last 35 minutes?

15:55.240 --> 15:56.680
-Eva?
-Ruben.

15:56.760 --> 16:00.560
When, and only when,
I'm at least 90% certain

16:00.640 --> 16:02.960
that we can verify
what the target was,

16:03.040 --> 16:04.400
I'll come running to my boss.

16:04.480 --> 16:07.600
-Who would immediately report...
-Can I speak to you? Now!

16:11.720 --> 16:13.280
You think that's funny?

16:16.360 --> 16:19.040
How dare you barge into my meeting?

16:19.120 --> 16:22.040
-Hardenberg needs something now.
-Fine. He can have this.

16:22.120 --> 16:24.080
"The investigation is still ongoing."

16:25.600 --> 16:26.600
Ok.

16:27.160 --> 16:29.720
If so, you can tell him yourself.

16:40.160 --> 16:41.760
What is going on?

16:41.840 --> 16:42.800
Hey!

16:52.520 --> 16:54.080
Hi Sigrid! Is everything ok?

16:55.960 --> 16:58.960
-Are you ok?
<i>-Yeah. I'm fine.</i>

17:02.440 --> 17:03.640
Am I interrupting?

17:03.720 --> 17:08.240
No, no. I told you, you can always
call me about anything. What is it?

17:10.480 --> 17:11.960
How is the...

17:13.360 --> 17:14.640
<i>climbing going?</i>

17:17.520 --> 17:18.880
It's going...

17:20.040 --> 17:20.960
really well.

17:21.040 --> 17:22.040
We...

17:22.600 --> 17:27.200
We took a 9-rope long route.

17:27.800 --> 17:32.000
At the hardest part it was 7B+.
So it was tough.

17:33.680 --> 17:35.320
But, yeah...

17:35.880 --> 17:39.720
You know we,
your father and I, always...

17:41.960 --> 17:43.840
dreamt of doing that route.

17:45.560 --> 17:46.960
So it was nice.

17:48.640 --> 17:50.080
I miss him.

17:52.400 --> 17:56.040
You have to remember that Bjørn
always wanted you to be happy.

17:57.480 --> 17:58.800
<i>I know.</i>

18:01.600 --> 18:02.920
How is Ragna?

18:06.600 --> 18:08.120
Ragna is fine.

18:22.880 --> 18:23.880
Minister...

18:26.000 --> 18:27.760
The fact that Ruben
brought you in here

18:27.840 --> 18:32.560
probably means that you're not ready
to reveal any investigation results.

18:32.640 --> 18:36.400
That's your right, and probably meant
as a virtuous gesture,

18:36.480 --> 18:38.200
but the truth is, it's just stupid.

18:38.280 --> 18:41.000
Minister, the investigation
is still in full swing.

18:41.080 --> 18:44.080
As is the upcoming election.

18:45.000 --> 18:47.360
What will my two opponents do?

18:48.360 --> 18:49.360
Show her.

18:53.400 --> 18:55.560
Amira Hamad visited
the scene this morning.

18:55.640 --> 18:59.120
<i>...the scene of the crime</i>
<i>and found moving and consoling words</i>

18:59.200 --> 19:01.160
<i>for the relatives of</i>
<i>the boy who was killed.</i>

19:01.240 --> 19:05.120
<i>-It was an emotional performance...</i>
-Amira Hamad visited the scene.

19:08.000 --> 19:09.920
That damned witch.

19:11.040 --> 19:15.280
She is a woman. And she is from
an immigrant background.

19:15.360 --> 19:17.320
She won't wait for our investigation.

19:17.400 --> 19:21.320
No, she goes straight to the victims
and puts everything on one card.

19:21.400 --> 19:23.920
She offers her condolences
to the dead boy's mother.

19:24.000 --> 19:26.840
Rudolf Hensel also knows how
to make the most out of this.

19:26.920 --> 19:27.760
Why?

19:27.840 --> 19:31.360
They know the election will be over
before you finish your investigation.

19:31.440 --> 19:33.480
Then it doesn't matter
what comes out of it.

19:33.560 --> 19:36.360
After the election,
the truth just doesn't matter.

19:36.440 --> 19:37.840
The truth always matters.

19:40.280 --> 19:41.720
No, that's right.

19:42.280 --> 19:46.440
You can then speak to Rudolf Hensel's
Nazi minister about the truth.

19:55.120 --> 19:56.520
She's not saying anything?

19:59.480 --> 20:00.560
That's tough.

20:06.680 --> 20:07.680
Let's go!

20:08.240 --> 20:10.120
-What is this?
-Come on.

20:15.760 --> 20:17.160
Good afternoon.

20:17.240 --> 20:20.400
As you know, police special forces

20:20.480 --> 20:23.400
fired two shots
at a fugitive yesterday

20:23.480 --> 20:25.760
during a house search in Neukölln.

20:25.840 --> 20:27.720
The investigation is still ongoing,

20:27.800 --> 20:30.840
and the arrested persons are
being questioned at the moment.

20:30.920 --> 20:33.280
There is no need to worry.

20:33.360 --> 20:37.480
Minister, one question. You can
understand why the public is worried?

20:37.560 --> 20:40.800
People have a right to
their feelings. Also fear.

20:40.880 --> 20:44.560
That was not my question.
Are the people in Germany safe?

20:46.200 --> 20:50.000
Let me put it in a way
ordinary people will understand.

20:50.080 --> 20:55.400
Security is something that we should
all take for granted in Germany.

20:55.480 --> 20:57.840
Excuse me, a child was killed.

20:58.360 --> 21:00.680
Yes, a Muslim boy got killed,

21:00.760 --> 21:03.600
because he was evading
the reach of our operational forces.

21:03.680 --> 21:05.640
Our officers had to weigh up and act.

21:06.360 --> 21:09.000
Of course we mourn
the death of this boy,

21:09.080 --> 21:12.120
it affects us very much,
but this is also the result of...

21:12.800 --> 21:15.760
the fight against
international terrorism.

21:15.840 --> 21:18.880
Sources say you had information
about an imminent attack.

21:18.960 --> 21:20.320
What do you say?

21:21.520 --> 21:24.360
I can't comment on the investigation.
I'm sure you understand.

21:24.440 --> 21:26.840
The NAD leader, Rudolf Hensel,

21:26.920 --> 21:30.320
just gave a statement claiming
you're lying about the attack.

21:34.880 --> 21:37.320
He provided a police report showing

21:37.400 --> 21:40.680
that the arrested Safar brothers
were suspects of rape

21:40.760 --> 21:43.040
15 months ago in Stuttgart.

21:44.200 --> 21:47.720
But due to bad police work,
both were released.

21:49.960 --> 21:52.200
-What is this?
-LKA haven't reported this to us,

21:52.280 --> 21:54.520
-but obviously leaked it.
-Themselves.

21:58.360 --> 22:00.560
-We have a problem.
-Yes, we just heard.

22:00.640 --> 22:03.240
We will find out why we weren't
given this information.

22:03.320 --> 22:04.320
I know why.

22:04.400 --> 22:06.960
I stepped on their toes
yesterday in that damn meeting.

22:07.040 --> 22:08.240
When is the report from?

22:08.320 --> 22:11.560
You know what? We'll do it again.
We'll talk to the brothers ourselves.

22:18.800 --> 22:19.800
Daniel.

22:23.160 --> 22:24.960
Daniel! Hey!

22:26.440 --> 22:27.680
Why are you here?

22:28.600 --> 22:30.760
-Are you guilty of anything?
-Nothing.

22:33.200 --> 22:36.120
I've always been loyal.
What about you?

22:38.720 --> 22:40.000
Something is going on.

22:40.600 --> 22:42.600
Are you afraid
your friend will betray you?

22:42.680 --> 22:44.400
One tip and you're screwed.

22:47.120 --> 22:49.240
Or do you think your friend
will vouch for you?

22:52.040 --> 22:53.440
Are you two really...

22:55.800 --> 22:57.680
Close? Daniel?

22:58.680 --> 22:59.600
Hm?

23:00.480 --> 23:02.600
Danni? Huh?

23:06.120 --> 23:07.120
Where are you from?

23:10.520 --> 23:11.520
Who are you?

23:15.400 --> 23:17.040
You're the storyteller, right?

23:18.520 --> 23:19.320
Furia.

23:20.880 --> 23:21.880
The legend maker.

23:30.000 --> 23:31.760
It's a pretty good cover, actually.

23:32.720 --> 23:34.800
Playing with words. Gaining trust.

23:35.680 --> 23:38.600
While feeding the police with intel.
Am I right?

23:38.680 --> 23:40.040
I just have a question.

23:40.120 --> 23:42.920
You've called all three of us rats.

23:43.000 --> 23:45.080
I mean, that's very unlikely.

23:45.640 --> 23:46.800
Three rats.

23:47.560 --> 23:50.240
You were thrown in here to
make a fuss, isn't that so?

23:50.880 --> 23:52.280
Are you spying on us?

23:57.920 --> 23:59.200
Is he bothering you?

23:59.800 --> 24:01.720
My apologies. Come with me.

24:18.560 --> 24:20.080
Why can't Ole be here?

24:23.320 --> 24:25.360
My people did some research.

24:27.400 --> 24:30.160
Your stories... from Sweden.

24:30.240 --> 24:31.680
Remember? Gothenburg?

24:33.120 --> 24:34.120
Yeah.

24:36.400 --> 24:37.760
Do you know these men?

24:49.960 --> 24:52.240
They're Swedish. Brothers, I think.

24:52.320 --> 24:55.480
How do they fit into your story
about Gothenburg?

24:57.800 --> 24:58.920
They don't.

25:00.640 --> 25:03.280
They're just a part of the scene
down there.

25:05.680 --> 25:06.560
Ok.

25:07.560 --> 25:08.400
Let's call them.

25:26.680 --> 25:28.000
Hello, Sweden.

25:28.080 --> 25:30.000
<i>Hey. Is she there now?</i>

25:30.080 --> 25:31.080
Hang on.

25:32.480 --> 25:35.800
Could you please tell me how you met?

25:35.880 --> 25:36.920
If it's her.

25:37.000 --> 25:38.640
<i>I can't really see her.</i>

25:38.720 --> 25:40.360
Yeah. Please turn around.

25:42.280 --> 25:43.240
<i>Yeah, it's her.</i>

25:44.400 --> 25:45.960
<i>It's definitely her.</i>

25:47.200 --> 25:48.840
<i>She almost killed my brother.</i>

25:49.400 --> 25:53.840
Wasn't this right after her boyfriend
nearly got beaten to death?

25:53.920 --> 25:57.800
<i>I don't know about her boyfriend.</i>
<i>I mean, this was without a boyfriend.</i>

25:57.880 --> 26:00.560
<i>But she beat up Gustav. It was her.</i>

26:00.640 --> 26:02.240
<i>And then she disappeared.</i>

26:02.960 --> 26:04.720
You really wanna talk about this?

26:08.000 --> 26:11.920
Well, I don't talk about it,
because it's a bloody embarrassment.

26:12.000 --> 26:15.440
That you guys say you fight for
our culture and our values.

26:16.160 --> 26:19.160
And you say that Muslim
and African men mistreat their women.

26:20.040 --> 26:21.880
Why don't you tell him the truth?

26:22.760 --> 26:25.160
How you and your brother
tried to rape me.

26:25.240 --> 26:28.520
Of course you didn't press charges
because you know you'd lose.

26:28.600 --> 26:30.680
You should be glad
that the police saved you

26:30.760 --> 26:33.400
<i>-and I didn't kill you.</i>
<i>-I don't know what fucked you up,</i>

26:33.480 --> 26:35.640
<i>but we didn't try to rape you!</i>
<i>You lying bitch!</i>

26:47.280 --> 26:48.800
I had my reasons...

26:50.480 --> 26:52.120
why I left Sweden.

26:55.120 --> 26:57.360
First I met those Muslim men.

26:57.440 --> 27:01.840
And then I met those fuckers who
pride themselves with white culture.

27:01.920 --> 27:04.040
And then they try to rape women.

27:06.840 --> 27:07.840
Fuck them.

27:25.000 --> 27:26.760
Those guys...

27:27.960 --> 27:30.760
with their boots and flags...

27:31.600 --> 27:32.880
and...

27:32.960 --> 27:35.520
stupid tattoos and swastikas...

27:37.520 --> 27:39.080
They're not us.

27:40.880 --> 27:44.360
They have no sense of what
identitarians should be.

27:44.440 --> 27:48.000
They have no goal of involving
everyday men and women in the f...

27:48.080 --> 27:49.840
in the threats facing our future.

27:53.480 --> 27:56.840
And if you keep
questioning my motives

27:56.920 --> 27:59.640
and you choose to side with
those fuckers...

28:01.480 --> 28:03.680
Well... then we're all fucked.

28:05.640 --> 28:06.680
You know what?

28:09.440 --> 28:15.440
You're probably being tracked by the
Swedish secret police as we speak.

28:15.520 --> 28:19.040
They are stupid swastika bearers.
Don't you think they're monitored?

28:21.040 --> 28:22.640
It's untraceable.

28:22.720 --> 28:24.840
They think we called from Hungary.

28:29.360 --> 28:30.360
Stay calm.

28:36.240 --> 28:38.960
Interrogators have been
talking to the brothers for hours,

28:39.040 --> 28:40.720
but it's like talking to
a brick wall.

28:41.280 --> 28:44.320
They act like innocent lambs.
They know nothing.

28:44.400 --> 28:47.160
And now you come here
to show us how it's done, right?

28:47.240 --> 28:48.920
I probably won't get anywhere either,

28:49.000 --> 28:51.960
but I would like to get an
impression, if you don't mind.

28:52.040 --> 28:53.640
No, please.

28:53.720 --> 28:56.960
And I assume we'll get the
transcripts from those interrogations

28:57.040 --> 28:59.560
before anyone in the NAD
can read them.

28:59.640 --> 29:00.720
Of course.

29:00.800 --> 29:02.800
I would like to speak to
Hamid Safar first.

29:05.560 --> 29:06.560
Hello.

29:07.440 --> 29:10.000
-Hello.
-Who are you?

29:10.080 --> 29:11.720
I only have one quick question.

29:12.320 --> 29:17.080
My file says that your daughter
is suffering from severe asthma.

29:17.160 --> 29:19.040
She is six years old.

29:20.160 --> 29:23.160
<i>Are you sure that after your</i>
<i>deportation back to Iraq...</i>

29:23.240 --> 29:25.120
<i>-Objection!</i>
-...sufficient medical care

29:25.200 --> 29:26.240
will be ensured?

29:27.120 --> 29:29.480
What is this? Are you threatening me?

29:29.560 --> 29:31.880
-I'm protesting this threat.
-Who are you?

29:31.960 --> 29:36.120
I might be able to help your daughter
if you tell me what your targets are.

29:36.720 --> 29:38.560
<i>What kind of targets?</i>

29:38.640 --> 29:40.200
<i>We're not terrorists.</i>

29:41.280 --> 29:43.840
Then why are you
in contact with this man?

29:47.280 --> 29:51.680
This is not me, this is my brother.
My brother met this guy, not me.

29:51.760 --> 29:54.600
<i>Listen. They'll deport you.</i>
<i>And your daughter too.</i>

29:56.080 --> 29:58.200
Just because of
the rape in Stuttgart alone.

29:58.280 --> 30:00.400
-You don't have to...
-I haven't raped anyone.

30:00.480 --> 30:02.240
<i>That was my brother.</i>

30:17.040 --> 30:19.280
Calm down, we'll find a solution.

30:19.360 --> 30:22.360
You are in contact with
all these people.

30:24.080 --> 30:26.120
All of these men
are being arrested right now.

30:26.200 --> 30:27.960
In Hamburg, Frankfurt, Munich...

30:28.040 --> 30:30.080
But you know better than I do.

30:30.160 --> 30:31.600
You heard your brother.

30:31.680 --> 30:33.480
He'll testify against you
for the rape.

30:33.560 --> 30:36.480
To save himself and his daughter
from deportation.

30:36.560 --> 30:39.240
<i>If I can get details on</i>
<i>all the targets,</i>

30:39.320 --> 30:42.680
if you give full information
about all these men,

30:42.760 --> 30:46.400
and if the missing C4 turns up,
then maybe I can help you a little.

30:50.440 --> 30:52.680
I need more time on Daniel.

30:54.240 --> 30:55.240
Thanks.

30:56.600 --> 30:58.040
But Chris is lying.

31:00.280 --> 31:02.320
To his wife at least.
I don't trust that.

31:05.960 --> 31:07.560
What about the girl?

31:09.560 --> 31:11.520
Hard to say, but Chris knows more.

31:12.080 --> 31:14.560
Ok, you try to get Ragna talking,
and I'll try Chris.

31:16.040 --> 31:17.160
I'm doing my best.

31:17.240 --> 31:19.440
Hurry up. I need results.

31:25.640 --> 31:26.920
My patience is limited.

31:30.560 --> 31:32.000
Put away the cup!

31:38.760 --> 31:42.400
I'm about to start torturing
all of you.

31:43.840 --> 31:45.160
Don't look at me like that.

31:45.240 --> 31:48.320
You were Chris' right-hand man.
Everything he knows, you know.

31:48.400 --> 31:50.360
Come up with something good.

31:53.200 --> 31:55.080
Maybe you're the little birdie.

31:55.160 --> 31:56.440
Tweet, tweet.

32:08.960 --> 32:10.320
Chris. Come.

32:12.800 --> 32:14.600
I... I have to pee.

32:15.520 --> 32:17.320
Ok. You too.

32:29.120 --> 32:32.480
Listen. We don't have much time.
I know you're undercover.

32:34.240 --> 32:35.200
Sure.

32:40.600 --> 32:42.440
Sit down.
Stay away from the cameras.

32:42.520 --> 32:44.440
We don't have time for this.
Sit down.

32:46.040 --> 32:48.400
The crypto lead
that bothers Brehme...

32:49.320 --> 32:51.520
One of the reasons
he thinks there is a snitch.

32:51.600 --> 32:52.960
The leak came from me.

32:54.400 --> 32:57.480
But the other reason, the picture,
definitely didn't.

32:58.200 --> 32:59.800
It's not coming from those guys.

32:59.880 --> 33:02.360
If they were German police,
I would have known by now.

33:03.000 --> 33:04.760
So that only leaves you.

33:07.800 --> 33:08.680
You're bluffing.

33:10.600 --> 33:12.360
I was recruited by the military.

33:12.440 --> 33:14.880
I was trained and asked to
create a racist scandal,

33:14.960 --> 33:16.960
I beat an Afghani soldier
almost to death.

33:18.480 --> 33:21.240
At least that's what
my friends and relatives think.

33:21.320 --> 33:24.320
I've been in this cell
for almost four years.

33:28.240 --> 33:29.840
And this is your dilemma now.

33:29.920 --> 33:33.200
If you don't believe me,
you should tell them, but now.

33:41.360 --> 33:44.200
Listen.
If it's me who gets busted first...

33:44.280 --> 33:45.760
make sure I die.

33:45.840 --> 33:48.360
I know what they do to snitches.
Help me.

34:14.360 --> 34:16.400
Hey. Kathi?

34:16.480 --> 34:17.480
Yes.

34:19.080 --> 34:21.480
-Asgeir. Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

34:22.120 --> 34:23.880
You want anything?

34:24.440 --> 34:26.080
I'll have the same.

34:26.160 --> 34:28.000
Excuse me. One more coffee, please.

34:28.080 --> 34:29.400
-Sure.
-Thank you.

34:32.560 --> 34:34.240
This feels like a weird blind date.

34:36.840 --> 34:40.320
Inger doesn't know that this has
become Berlin's most infamous

34:40.400 --> 34:41.960
singles cafe, so...

34:43.080 --> 34:46.200
Ok, I get it. I guess that's a...

34:46.280 --> 34:49.400
That's a good thing
for a lonely tourist.

34:51.440 --> 34:53.960
But you have a friend
traveling to Berlin, no?

34:55.160 --> 34:56.320
Yes.

34:56.400 --> 34:57.840
Yes, I do.

34:57.920 --> 34:59.040
There you go.

34:59.680 --> 35:01.160
-Thank you.
-Enjoy.

35:02.680 --> 35:03.680
Well...

35:05.480 --> 35:08.480
I have a friend who works
in the same business as your friend.

35:10.800 --> 35:13.800
So maybe they should know about
each other so no one gets hurt.

35:24.280 --> 35:26.360
He works in Russian financing.

35:30.400 --> 35:33.040
-Really?
-Yeah. The cryptocurrency.

35:40.440 --> 35:42.360
That's interesting.

35:48.280 --> 35:50.040
I'd like to know more about that.

35:50.120 --> 35:51.360
I'll do my best.

35:52.760 --> 35:54.160
But...

35:54.240 --> 35:55.600
I need your help too.

35:57.040 --> 36:00.600
The thing is, I lost contact.
I can't reach him at the moment.

36:03.000 --> 36:05.240
It seems like we have
the same problem.

36:11.560 --> 36:13.600
This is the banker.

36:14.240 --> 36:16.040
Won't speak without his lawyer.

36:16.600 --> 36:20.280
-What happened to his arm?
-He tried to flee when we came.

36:20.360 --> 36:21.760
And you broke his arm?

36:21.840 --> 36:23.480
He dislocated his shoulder.

36:23.560 --> 36:25.280
-What?
-I'm not kidding.

36:25.360 --> 36:27.440
When he threw the briefcase
out of the window.

36:40.520 --> 36:41.880
We'll take the laptop.

36:48.680 --> 36:50.080
And?

36:50.160 --> 36:51.920
We're trying to get in right now.

36:54.800 --> 36:56.800
-Coffee?
-Yes, sure.

36:58.760 --> 37:00.320
We almost have it.

37:10.520 --> 37:11.480
Three.

37:13.760 --> 37:14.680
Two.

37:17.920 --> 37:18.720
One.

37:24.840 --> 37:26.440
What? What just happened?

37:27.440 --> 37:28.600
That's not possible.

37:28.680 --> 37:30.080
What's going on?

37:31.120 --> 37:34.040
Complete shutdown.
That's never happened.

37:37.960 --> 37:39.680
But we're in now, right?

37:41.280 --> 37:42.360
But there is nothing.

37:44.640 --> 37:47.200
It's wiped clean.
They must have had a burner program.

37:47.280 --> 37:49.920
But how did they know we were
entering if we were offline?

37:50.000 --> 37:53.680
Please shut down all your systems.
Turn everything off for a moment.

37:55.760 --> 37:58.800
Could everything on the computer
have been deleted from the inside?

37:58.880 --> 38:00.680
What? What do you mean?

38:00.760 --> 38:02.920
Who knows the identity of our agents?

38:03.680 --> 38:06.440
A couple of people on my team.
And our leadership, of course.

38:09.960 --> 38:10.920
Our computer.

38:11.000 --> 38:12.920
Morelli wanted us to
hook up the computer.

38:13.000 --> 38:14.480
You need to find your agent.

38:30.720 --> 38:32.000
I'm losing patience.

38:33.520 --> 38:35.120
What about Chris?

38:36.320 --> 38:37.480
Not guilty.

38:38.480 --> 38:40.120
The snitch is still here.

38:41.080 --> 38:42.360
In this room.

38:48.160 --> 38:49.120
Daniel, come.

38:49.920 --> 38:52.000
No. No, please. No.

38:53.160 --> 38:55.520
No, stop. Let me go! Help!

38:55.600 --> 38:58.440
Please don't. No!

38:58.520 --> 38:59.760
Help!

38:59.840 --> 39:00.840
Help!

39:17.400 --> 39:18.400
Listen...

39:19.000 --> 39:21.720
It's very obvious.
They're gonna kill one of us.

39:21.800 --> 39:24.160
And they'll do whatever
hellish thing they planned.

39:24.240 --> 39:26.400
They've planned it for years,
I know it now.

39:28.880 --> 39:32.520
I thought I worked on finances
for alt-right digital propaganda.

39:33.240 --> 39:36.200
But I've just seen the financial
structure of this whole operation

39:36.280 --> 39:40.320
and this is about
a big fucking terror attack.

39:40.400 --> 39:43.600
I thought there were only three
programmers, but there are many more.

39:47.600 --> 39:49.480
I'm not saying I believe you.

39:52.800 --> 39:53.840
What's the target?

39:53.920 --> 39:55.400
I don't know.

39:58.520 --> 39:59.880
There are circles.

39:59.960 --> 40:01.280
And sub-groups.

40:01.360 --> 40:04.400
I didn't even know about any
physical attack until yesterday.

40:04.480 --> 40:07.120
I'm into online operations.
I feed fear.

40:07.200 --> 40:09.440
But you, you have to be very careful.

40:10.720 --> 40:14.320
Their leaks amongst them are meant to
protect us, and I don't know who.

40:14.400 --> 40:17.120
I heard Brehme saying something
about "our Scorpio".

40:19.120 --> 40:20.920
But I don't know what it means.

40:25.200 --> 40:26.200
Listen.

40:26.880 --> 40:30.160
We have to promise each other
that none of us get tortured.

40:32.320 --> 40:33.840
Promise me this.

40:34.680 --> 40:37.680
Don't let me be tortured.
I will do the same thing for you.

40:49.240 --> 40:50.240
Good.

40:51.240 --> 40:54.600
<i>I've already asked nicely,</i>
<i>if you're going to talk, talk to me.</i>

40:55.480 --> 40:59.640
Look at him. He's so confident.
He knows we fell for his Trojan.

40:59.720 --> 41:02.400
That's not possible.
Our system is completely sealed off.

41:02.480 --> 41:05.240
<i>Ask your client:</i>
<i>Why did you flee if you are innocent?</i>

41:06.480 --> 41:07.960
Unless we have a mole.

41:08.520 --> 41:12.400
<i>Then I'll ask him again myself:</i>
<i>Why did you flee if you are innocent?</i>

41:14.240 --> 41:15.200
Vanessa...

41:15.840 --> 41:19.280
Ask him about his contacts in Russia.
Tell him that we're investigating him

41:19.360 --> 41:21.360
<i>for endangering national security.</i>

41:24.360 --> 41:27.320
You already know that laundering
money from Russia is a felony.

41:28.040 --> 41:30.360
And election meddling
threatens national security...

41:30.440 --> 41:32.120
Please excuse me for a moment.

41:40.880 --> 41:43.800
Do you see me well?

41:43.880 --> 41:46.280
<i>Yes? Do you hear me too?</i>

41:47.240 --> 41:48.840
<i>Well, then, listen to me.</i>

41:49.880 --> 41:55.560
<i>My client won't say a word until you</i>
<i>present evidence of wrongdoing.</i>

41:56.120 --> 41:59.720
<i>If you're lucky,</i>
<i>we won't make a big deal out of this.</i>

42:00.400 --> 42:03.600
<i>But you can't hide behind windows</i>

42:03.680 --> 42:06.840
<i>and hollow phrases</i>
<i>like "national security".</i>

42:06.920 --> 42:09.560
<i>This is illegal seizure,</i>

42:09.640 --> 42:13.600
<i>illegal detention,</i>
<i>and an illegal interrogation.</i>

42:14.160 --> 42:17.040
<i>You will let my client go now.</i>

42:18.800 --> 42:20.280
<i>But...</i>

42:21.840 --> 42:23.720
We need to check out this lawyer.

42:24.280 --> 42:25.960
He's not just a normal lawyer.

42:31.360 --> 42:32.960
What the hell are you doing?

42:33.040 --> 42:35.000
Ole. What does it look like?

42:35.080 --> 42:36.080
Is Ragna ok?

42:38.240 --> 42:39.240
Ok, stop.

42:40.160 --> 42:41.160
Untie him.

42:42.200 --> 42:43.240
The Scorpio.

42:43.320 --> 42:44.760
I asked you a question.

42:44.840 --> 42:45.760
Yes. Come with me.

42:45.840 --> 42:49.480
I hear you.
But now I know who the traitor is.

42:50.720 --> 42:51.720
Who is it?

42:58.120 --> 43:01.160
-Ragna...
-No, there's no fucking way!

43:01.240 --> 43:02.640
...is not the one.

43:02.720 --> 43:03.920
Fuck you!

43:04.000 --> 43:07.640
Fuck us. I wanted to see your face.
How attached you were.

43:10.040 --> 43:11.240
How much does he know?

43:11.840 --> 43:15.840
He knows only about the financial
side of our propaganda work.

43:15.920 --> 43:18.640
He's been working on
digital platforms only.

43:19.600 --> 43:21.640
And buying marketing for crypto.

43:23.360 --> 43:26.200
Nothing about the Berlin operation.
Let's print that.

43:30.560 --> 43:31.720
-Brehme.
-Yeah?

43:33.160 --> 43:36.320
Don't ever fucking play me like that
again. Do you understand me?

43:37.960 --> 43:41.800
I don't have time for you
questioning my methods now.

43:43.080 --> 43:45.840
They arrested
one of our bankers today.

43:45.920 --> 43:49.240
If we get problems with the Russians,
we're really in deep shit.

43:57.560 --> 43:59.200
Dismissed. Get the fuck out.

44:00.680 --> 44:01.680
Come.

44:07.040 --> 44:08.280
PERSONNEL SHEET

44:15.800 --> 44:18.240
Jan, you are a dead man.

44:18.320 --> 44:21.320
Almost. First I'll find out
what you've told them.

44:21.400 --> 44:24.760
And you will tell me, trust me.
I'll take my time.

44:24.840 --> 44:26.800
You're just as dead as I am.

44:32.640 --> 44:34.040
You better go, this will...

44:34.120 --> 44:36.200
-You're a fucking cop?
-Get out.

44:36.280 --> 44:38.960
-Traitor. Why don't you...
-Get the fuck out.

44:40.600 --> 44:41.760
-Shit!
-Whoa!

45:05.640 --> 45:08.800
