00:13.041 --> 00:15.500

- No.

00:15.542 --> 00:16.542
- Taco season?

00:16.583 --> 00:18.709

But this year

00:29.333 --> 00:31.083

00:31.125 --> 00:32.250

00:32.291 --> 00:33.792

Perhaps a bar graph,

00:38.041 --> 00:40.709
a histogram,

00:40.750 --> 00:43.333
or, dare I say it,

00:40.750 --> 00:43.333
a scatterplot.

00:43.375 --> 00:44.375

00:54.542 --> 00:56.125

The first question will be...

07:41.500 --> 07:43.041
Mae.

07:43.083 --> 07:45.667
- My question is for Dawn.

07:45.709 --> 07:48.959
I think you're awesome,

07:45.709 --> 07:48.959
and I'm gonna vote for you.

My question is

08:00.125 --> 08:02.750

08:02.792 --> 08:03.917

08:06.542 --> 08:08.959

08:06.542 --> 08:08.959
so vote for me,

08:09.000 --> 08:13.083

08:09.000 --> 08:13.083
instead of this.

08:13.125 --> 08:15.917
[applause]

08:15.959 --> 08:18.667
- Actually, I meant

08:15.959 --> 08:18.667
the bathroom at home.

08:18.709 --> 08:22.417
Is your toothbrush the green one

08:18.709 --> 08:22.417
or the yellow one?

08:22.458 --> 08:24.458
Because I've been using both.

08:24.500 --> 08:27.125

Dawn, would you

08:27.166 --> 08:29.125
like to address

08:29.166 --> 08:31.500
the toilet tissue issue?

08:31.542 --> 08:33.959

09:38.333 --> 09:40.083
