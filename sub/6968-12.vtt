WEBVTT

00:03.754 --> 00:06.798
Blood everywhere.
Whoever killed her is a psycho.

00:06.924 --> 00:10.177
- Murder weapon?
- Seven stores in town carry strop razors.

00:10.302 --> 00:13.222
- Have somebody check 'em out.
- What about the press?

00:13.347 --> 00:16.391
Just the basics.
No mention of this "sister" thing.

00:16.517 --> 00:18.227
OK.

00:18.310 --> 00:21.647
Rubin, I need your final report.
Call me as soon as you hear.

00:21.772 --> 00:25.484
- That's all I can tell you.
- Can you give us a name?

00:25.609 --> 00:27.486
Yeah, I'll talk to you.

00:29.905 --> 00:33.325
We're doing the best we can.
We'll inform you...

00:38.914 --> 00:40.958
Brian, I need a minute.

00:41.083 --> 00:43.710
I'm working on a homicide investigation.

00:43.836 --> 00:45.546
Come on.

00:46.672 --> 00:48.549
You didn't show last night.

00:49.800 --> 00:51.718
This what you wanna talk about?

00:51.844 --> 00:54.513
I made dinner.

00:55.514 --> 00:57.266
What?

00:57.307 --> 00:59.852
Sorry. Coroner's on one.

01:00.853 --> 01:02.855
Yeah, what have you got, Rubin?

01:07.860 --> 01:09.695
Uh-huh.

01:11.000 --> 01:17.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:18.287 --> 01:20.747
Uh... Hang on a second, will you, Rubin?

01:32.426 --> 01:35.888
- This address, ten o'clock tonight.
- Where's this?

01:37.890 --> 01:41.018
- A motel?
- It's a place we can talk.

03:49.567 --> 03:51.611
<font color="#00FF00">X-Files</font> Season 2
Episode 12 - Aubrey

04:35.567 --> 04:37.611
Any cavities?

04:38.028 --> 04:40.697
I brush after every meal.

04:40.781 --> 04:42.824
Would you say they match?

04:46.370 --> 04:51.959
Well, there's a filling on the occlusal surface
of the upper left bicuspid, here and here.

04:53.752 --> 04:58.131
And he's congenitally missing
a lower left bicuspid, here and here.

04:58.215 --> 05:00.676
Yeah, I'd say they're definitely a match.

05:00.759 --> 05:04.096
- Who do they belong to?
- Special Agent Sam Chaney.

05:04.513 --> 05:07.766
- That name sounds familiar.
- Chaney's a legend.

05:07.850 --> 05:11.311
40 years before the Bureau
profiled violent criminals...

05:11.395 --> 05:15.190
...Chaney and his partner,
Tim Ledbetter, investigated...

05:15.274 --> 05:19.278
...what were then called "stranger killings",
now called "serial murders".

05:19.361 --> 05:23.448
They disappeared while investigating
murders in Aubrey, Missouri, in 1942.

05:23.532 --> 05:28.579
Chaney's body was only found two days ago
by a local detective, BJ Morrow, a woman.

05:28.745 --> 05:30.414
Why the interest in this case?

05:30.497 --> 05:35.335
At the time, Chaney's and Ledbetter's ideas
weren't very well received by their peers.

05:35.419 --> 05:39.256
Using psychology to solve a crime
was something like, um...

05:39.339 --> 05:41.842
- Believing in the paranormal?
- Exactly.

05:41.967 --> 05:43.927
But there's another mystery.

05:44.845 --> 05:45.846
Which is?

05:45.929 --> 05:51.143
Why would this policewoman suddenly drive
her car into a field the size of Rhode Island...

05:51.226 --> 05:55.981
...and, for no reason, dig up the bones
of a man who's been missing for 50 years?

05:56.106 --> 06:00.819
- Unless a neon sign said "Dig here"!
- I guess that's why we're going to Aubrey.

06:00.903 --> 06:05.449
Yes. And also, I've always
been intrigued by women named BJ.

06:14.249 --> 06:17.920
Detective Morrow,
exactly how did you discover the remains?

06:18.003 --> 06:20.088
I saw a dog digging in the ground.

06:20.172 --> 06:23.217
I proceeded to investigate
and found the grave site.

06:23.300 --> 06:28.222
The initial police report states that
you couldn't explain your actions at the time.

06:28.305 --> 06:31.558
It was late.
I was a bit shocked by my discovery.

06:31.642 --> 06:36.230
I'm afraid I didn't clearly articulate
what happened for my initial report.

06:37.105 --> 06:39.691
Why were you in the woods at that hour?

06:39.775 --> 06:42.986
My vehicle was experiencing engine failure.

06:44.029 --> 06:46.114
You left your car...

06:46.198 --> 06:48.033
Over there, sir.

06:48.867 --> 06:52.371
Would you say that's, uh... 400 or 500 yards?

06:54.748 --> 06:55.874
Yes, sir.

06:55.958 --> 07:00.420
So from that distance you could see
a dog digging in this field at night?

07:01.380 --> 07:06.176
She took a short cut through the woods to
reach a phone. The path led her to the field.

07:06.260 --> 07:11.306
The report says she phoned from the Motel
Black up the road. That's not a very short cut.

07:11.390 --> 07:15.435
You seem more interested
in how the missing agent was found...

07:15.519 --> 07:18.146
...than in how he got here in the first place.

07:18.230 --> 07:22.734
- You don't, uh... suspect her, do you?
- No, no. Not at all.

07:22.818 --> 07:26.989
- I'd just like to ask you a few more questions.
- All right.

07:28.031 --> 07:29.950
Have you ever, um...

07:30.033 --> 07:33.036
Have you ever had
any clairvoyant experiences?

07:33.120 --> 07:37.249
Premonitions, visions,
precognitive dreams, things like that?

07:37.374 --> 07:39.835
What the hell kind of question is that?

07:40.878 --> 07:42.838
- Dreams?
- Yeah.

07:42.921 --> 07:46.091
Agent Mulder, I don't mean to be rude,
but we have a lot to do.

07:46.633 --> 07:51.430
If you have any more questions specific
to your investigation of this crime...

07:51.513 --> 07:53.724
...please feel free to call. Come on, BJ.

08:02.107 --> 08:04.318
What do you think?

08:14.369 --> 08:16.330
These bones are in good condition.

08:16.413 --> 08:19.708
The field may have been tilled
soon after Chaney was buried.

08:19.791 --> 08:25.047
There are small cuts on the top three ribs.
I don't think they were made by an animal.

08:25.130 --> 08:30.594
Listen to this. "One must wonder how these
monsters are created." Chaney wrote this.

08:30.677 --> 08:34.972
"Did their home life mould them
into creatures that must maim and kill?"

08:35.057 --> 08:37.226
"Or are they demons from birth?"

08:37.308 --> 08:40.145
That's poetic, but it doesn't help us much.

08:40.229 --> 08:43.315
What did he say about the 1942 homicides?

08:43.398 --> 08:47.110
The press called the murderer
"the Slash Killer".

08:47.236 --> 08:51.156
His three victims
were all young women aged 25 to 30.

08:51.281 --> 08:54.493
He disabled them with a blow to the head.

08:56.245 --> 09:01.708
He'd carve the word "sister" on their chests
and paint it on the wall with their blood.

09:02.918 --> 09:05.003
The victims bled to death and...

09:05.087 --> 09:07.172
...the murderer was never found.

09:08.090 --> 09:09.675
Mulder...

09:09.758 --> 09:12.553
...these cuts on the ribs
could've been made by a razor.

09:13.762 --> 09:16.557
- Can you make out a word?
- No.

09:16.640 --> 09:21.144
But we might be able to if we can find
somebody in Aubrey with a digital scanner.

09:22.479 --> 09:27.025
I've scanned the crime photo and ribcage
images and modemed them to Quantico.

09:27.109 --> 09:29.278
It'll be a few seconds before hook-up.

09:29.403 --> 09:32.698
I checked with the mechanic.
BJ's car was just tuned.

09:32.781 --> 09:36.159
She lied about experiencing engine failure.

09:36.243 --> 09:39.955
I don't think BJ was in the woods
because of engine failure.

09:40.038 --> 09:42.082
What are you talking about?

09:42.165 --> 09:44.543
The Motel Black is a perfect meeting place.

09:44.668 --> 09:48.046
- Away from town, away from his wife.
- What do you mean?

09:48.130 --> 09:51.300
It's obvious BJ and Tillman
are having an affair.

09:51.884 --> 09:53.343
How do you know?

09:53.427 --> 09:55.929
- A woman senses these things.
- Oh...

09:57.806 --> 10:00.309
The image on the right is Chaney's ribcage.

10:00.392 --> 10:05.147
The left one was extrapolated from the crime
photo of the Slash Killer's last victim.

10:05.230 --> 10:10.944
Now I need to enlarge the victim's ribcage
in order to allow for gender difference.

10:15.657 --> 10:18.285
And now... we can compare them.

10:23.040 --> 10:26.001
Could he have carved out another word
on his ribcage?

10:33.425 --> 10:36.261
I'm searching for
any matching pattern of cuts.

10:36.345 --> 10:38.347
Agent Mulder?

10:38.430 --> 10:41.433
Have you made any progress
in the investigation?

10:41.517 --> 10:43.101
Uh, we may have.

10:43.185 --> 10:47.314
Agent Chaney might have been
a victim of the killer he was trying to catch.

10:47.397 --> 10:51.527
We're trying to determine if the cuts
on his ribcage spell out a word.

10:59.868 --> 11:01.995
Are you all right?

11:02.079 --> 11:04.289
I'm sorry. Something...

11:06.291 --> 11:09.419
I'm not feel... Excuse me.

11:23.308 --> 11:25.102
Feeling better?

11:26.103 --> 11:28.313
I'm fine now.

11:34.778 --> 11:37.072
Things must be difficult for you now.

11:37.155 --> 11:43.787
I've had feelings for people I've worked with.
Interoffice relationships can be complicated.

11:44.496 --> 11:47.249
Especially when he's married.

11:51.295 --> 11:53.380
You're pregnant, aren't you?

12:01.471 --> 12:03.557
Does it show?

12:05.058 --> 12:06.852
No, not yet.

12:10.355 --> 12:13.358
Now I know why my mother
only had one child.

12:13.442 --> 12:17.279
She told me about the nausea,
but not about the nightmares.

12:17.404 --> 12:19.114
Nightmares?

12:19.239 --> 12:21.241
It's always the same.

12:21.325 --> 12:23.493
I'm in a house.

12:23.577 --> 12:29.166
It feels familiar. There's a woman
that's been hurt. There's a mirror.

12:29.249 --> 12:31.376
I see a man's reflection.

12:31.752 --> 12:35.047
I recognise his face, but I don't know him.

12:35.130 --> 12:38.383
What I remember most is the blood.
There's a lot of blood.

12:39.259 --> 12:41.428
Have you talked to anyone about this?

12:41.512 --> 12:46.725
I'm sure it's something about the pregnancy.
If anyone else knew I was pregnant...

12:47.976 --> 12:50.270
Brian would kill me if I told anyone.

12:50.354 --> 12:52.272
What are you going to do?

12:52.356 --> 12:54.483
I don't know.

13:03.450 --> 13:07.246
Well, BJ's pregnant. And Tillman's the father.

13:08.997 --> 13:14.753
Um, I've approximated the pattern of the cuts
to match up with the letters.

13:16.088 --> 13:19.258
There's a 93% chance that this is the letter R.

13:20.425 --> 13:23.303
And if you lower the probability to 79%...

13:23.762 --> 13:26.390
...you get the letters I, E and R.

13:28.767 --> 13:31.895
It could be a word,
or it could just be random slashes.

13:31.979 --> 13:35.858
If we exhumed a victim
of the Slash Killer, we could do a CT scan...

13:35.941 --> 13:39.152
...to determine if the cuts
were made by the same instrument.

13:39.236 --> 13:43.073
That means getting a court order.
That could take two days.

13:43.156 --> 13:46.451
- Maybe we could find a relative who could...
- Brother.

13:47.786 --> 13:49.329
Excuse me?

13:49.413 --> 13:51.415
I know what it says.

13:51.915 --> 13:54.209
On the ribcage, it spells "brother".

14:04.303 --> 14:05.929
You're right.

14:06.430 --> 14:08.056
BJ?

14:09.308 --> 14:10.934
Brian.

14:13.103 --> 14:15.063
What's goin' on here, BJ?

14:15.147 --> 14:19.109
- Nothing.
- Really? Then where'd you get these?

14:20.027 --> 14:24.114
These are crime-scene photos.
They were sealed. No one had access to 'em.

14:24.198 --> 14:26.325
You're wrong. Those were shot in 1942.

14:26.408 --> 14:29.578
These are from a homicide
that occurred three days ago.

14:29.661 --> 14:33.707
No, they're from a case that Ledbetter
and Chaney investigated in 1942...

14:33.832 --> 14:35.667
...before they disappeared.

14:50.432 --> 14:53.185
Three days ago,
a young woman was murdered.

14:53.268 --> 14:57.314
The word "sister" was carved
into her chest and painted on the wall.

14:57.397 --> 15:01.068
Only myself, the coroner
and one of my men knew about this.

15:03.695 --> 15:07.199
Excuse me, sir. We just got a call.
There's been another one.

15:18.502 --> 15:20.379
Watch your step, sir.

15:25.050 --> 15:27.344
The victim's name is Verna Johnson.

15:37.187 --> 15:39.022
Oh, my God.

15:40.065 --> 15:43.235
- BJ?
- It's her.

15:46.780 --> 15:49.032
It's the woman in my dream.

15:55.289 --> 15:57.666
Ow!

15:57.749 --> 16:00.043
Oh, you'll be all right.

16:01.753 --> 16:03.463
Honey, you're fine.

16:03.547 --> 16:05.549
The mothering instinct.

16:06.884 --> 16:09.303
I've been feeling it a lot lately.

16:10.262 --> 16:13.682
I used to hate it
when my mother hovered over me.

16:13.765 --> 16:16.018
I swore I'd never be like her.

16:16.518 --> 16:19.855
I think we all feel that way
at one time or another.

16:21.315 --> 16:23.066
My father was a cop.

16:23.150 --> 16:25.235
A good cop.

16:25.319 --> 16:27.738
That's all I ever wanted to be.

16:28.238 --> 16:33.702
He'd say what we're doing here is nonsense.
That you can't solve a crime from a dream.

16:33.785 --> 16:39.374
I've often felt that dreams are answers to
questions we haven't figured out how to ask.

16:41.251 --> 16:43.629
You said you were in a familiar house?

16:44.171 --> 16:46.298
There's a woman that's been hurt.

16:46.381 --> 16:50.928
I look in a mirror and I see a man's reflection.

16:51.011 --> 16:52.846
What does he look like?

16:52.971 --> 16:56.433
He's... got a rash on his face.

16:57.059 --> 16:59.019
And his eyes are...

16:59.895 --> 17:01.897
...intense.

17:02.397 --> 17:04.398
Do you remember anything else?

17:06.568 --> 17:11.281
There's this strange picture
on the wall behind him.

17:11.365 --> 17:16.286
It's a building like the...
Washington Monument, but different.

17:16.369 --> 17:17.871
And there's a...

17:18.288 --> 17:21.165
...a big circular thing beside it.

17:21.250 --> 17:23.961
- Do you think you could draw it?
- Sure.

17:33.136 --> 17:35.514
It looked something like this.

17:36.765 --> 17:38.767
What do you think it is?

17:40.018 --> 17:44.022
Could be the Trylon and the Perisphere.
Ever been to New York City?

17:44.106 --> 17:45.274
No, never.

17:45.357 --> 17:49.361
You can get pictures of these
on postcards all over Times Square.

17:49.444 --> 17:52.322
These were symbols of the 1939 World's Fair.

17:52.447 --> 17:55.325
Do you know why
they might have been in your dream?

17:55.450 --> 17:57.744
No idea at all.

18:16.263 --> 18:17.973
Good night.

18:20.267 --> 18:22.352
You're here kind of late.

18:26.899 --> 18:31.361
- What are you looking for?
- I just wanted to check on somethin'.

18:35.240 --> 18:37.951
I don't get it. That book's from the 1940s.

18:43.123 --> 18:45.459
Can we talk?

18:46.960 --> 18:49.796
You know, I'm willing to go with you...

18:50.964 --> 18:53.258
...for the appointment.

18:53.342 --> 18:55.636
I'm not so sure it's what I wanna do.

18:56.762 --> 19:00.307
I thought we agreed
that it was the best thing for both of us.

19:07.773 --> 19:11.360
- I changed my mind.
- What do you mean, you changed...

19:11.485 --> 19:16.448
You can't just change your mind.
This isn't your decision. It's our decision.

19:17.157 --> 19:19.243
BJ?

19:27.334 --> 19:29.419
It's him.

19:30.963 --> 19:33.090
Brian...

19:34.091 --> 19:36.176
I have to go.

19:40.222 --> 19:43.851
This is the man
BJ claims to have seen in her dream.

19:43.976 --> 19:47.145
Harry Cokely.
He lives in Gainesville, Nebraska...

19:47.229 --> 19:51.233
...since his release from McCallister
Penitentiary on December 5, 1993.

19:52.317 --> 19:56.238
He was convicted in 1945
for rape and attempted murder.

19:56.321 --> 20:00.325
Cokely carved "sister" on the chest
of his victim, Linda Thibedeaux...

20:00.409 --> 20:02.995
...before she could escape and get help.

20:03.078 --> 20:06.415
And the police never connected it
to the 1942 homicides?

20:08.208 --> 20:09.251
No.

20:09.334 --> 20:14.715
I don't wanna jump to any rash conclusions,
but I'd say he's definitely our prime suspect.

20:14.798 --> 20:18.218
Mulder, the man we're talking about
is 77 years old.

20:18.302 --> 20:22.055
George Foreman
won the heavyweight crown at 45.

20:22.139 --> 20:24.516
Some people are late bloomers.

20:24.975 --> 20:28.937
Anyway, this still doesn't explain
BJ's connection to all this.

20:29.021 --> 20:31.481
What if it's cryptomnesia?

20:31.773 --> 20:34.484
- Consciously forgotten information?
- Yeah.

20:34.568 --> 20:36.904
BJ's father was a policeman in the area.

20:37.029 --> 20:42.242
Maybe she heard him discuss the 1942 case
when she was young or saw Cokely's picture.

20:42.326 --> 20:46.705
That doesn't explain why she unearthed
the grave of an FBI agent.

20:46.788 --> 20:51.001
What if the recent murders triggered
what had been buried in her mind?

20:51.084 --> 20:54.963
Some connection she'd unconsciously made
that no one else had.

20:55.047 --> 20:57.007
- A hunch?
- Something like that.

20:57.090 --> 21:01.386
- That's a pretty extreme hunch.
- You've had some pretty extreme hunches.

21:01.470 --> 21:03.138
I never have.

21:37.881 --> 21:39.925
Harry Cokely?

21:42.970 --> 21:45.013
- Yeah.
- I'm Special Agent Mulder.

21:45.138 --> 21:49.685
This is Special Agent Scully. We're with
the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

21:49.768 --> 21:51.770
May we come in?

22:05.284 --> 22:10.539
Mr Cokely, our records show that in 1942
you lived in Terrance, Nebraska...

22:10.664 --> 22:13.709
...an hour's drive away from Aubrey, Missouri.

22:13.792 --> 22:16.920
During that time, three women
were murdered in Aubrey.

22:17.004 --> 22:19.965
Their assailant mutilated their bodies
with a razor...

22:20.048 --> 22:25.179
...in the same manner that you slashed
Mrs Linda Thibedeaux's body in 1945.

22:26.138 --> 22:28.682
I don't remember much about that.

22:29.057 --> 22:32.186
Well, I'm sure Mrs Thibedeaux
will never forget it.

22:36.607 --> 22:39.401
The doctors said I was sick back then.

22:41.153 --> 22:43.113
They gave me some pills.

22:44.114 --> 22:47.409
I served my time and... now I'm better.

22:48.702 --> 22:51.413
What kind of pills?

22:52.623 --> 22:54.708
Red and white ones, little sister.

22:55.167 --> 22:57.753
Do you recognise this man?

22:57.878 --> 22:59.963
His name's Chaney.

23:03.467 --> 23:04.676
No.

23:05.052 --> 23:08.764
He was an FBI agent
who was also murdered in Aubrey in 1942.

23:08.847 --> 23:12.726
Can you tell me where you were
about 8.35pm two nights ago, Mr Cokely?

23:14.019 --> 23:18.023
- Sittin' right where I am now.
- Do you have a witness to testify to that?

23:19.816 --> 23:22.027
Are you blind?

23:22.110 --> 23:25.155
I can't leave the house
without this damn thing.

23:25.239 --> 23:29.910
I sit right here in front of that TV
24 hours a day.

23:30.035 --> 23:35.541
On the night you're talkin' about, I was
sittin' here watchin' a show about a lost dog.

23:35.624 --> 23:39.503
- And after that, a show about...
- That won't be necessary.

23:40.045 --> 23:41.672
Good.

23:41.964 --> 23:46.844
Now, are you about finished with me,
little sister?

23:49.012 --> 23:51.056
For now.

24:28.177 --> 24:29.720
Aargh!

26:09.903 --> 26:13.240
I saw it was a woman.
She seemed to be in trouble but...

26:13.323 --> 26:17.828
...when I opened the door, she barged in
and came running down the stairs.

26:17.911 --> 26:19.913
So I called the police.

26:19.997 --> 26:22.040
He's here!

26:22.165 --> 26:23.917
He's here!

26:24.001 --> 26:26.253
BJ... What happened?

26:27.129 --> 26:29.173
- Oh, my God.
- He's here!

26:29.298 --> 26:32.801
Oh, my God. I'm taking her to the hospital.

27:06.084 --> 27:07.586
Thank you.

27:10.881 --> 27:13.008
I thought you might need these.

27:19.097 --> 27:20.724
Thanks.

27:21.308 --> 27:23.393
You hurt yourself.

27:24.978 --> 27:27.105
Can you tell us what happened, BJ?

27:28.732 --> 27:31.401
Cokely. He was in the room.

27:31.443 --> 27:33.820
- Cokely attacked you?
- Yes.

27:33.904 --> 27:36.281
He must have done this while I was asleep.

27:36.365 --> 27:39.785
- You're sure it was him?
- I know it was him.

27:39.868 --> 27:43.747
I saw his reflection in the mirror.
He looked just like his picture.

27:45.749 --> 27:48.418
- Like his mug shot?
- Yes.

27:49.253 --> 27:53.632
- That's the picture of a young man.
- But it was Cokely. I swear it was him.

27:54.716 --> 27:57.302
Well, I'll have Tillman pick him up.

28:01.807 --> 28:03.809
Where were you last night?

28:05.143 --> 28:07.104
Honolulu.

28:09.189 --> 28:12.526
You were in Aubrey, weren't you?

28:17.906 --> 28:20.742
How'd you get
into Detective Morrow's house?

28:20.826 --> 28:25.247
It's all I can do to get to the bathroom,
you damn fool!

28:25.330 --> 28:30.377
- The victim has identified you, Mr Cokely.
- I've already paid for my crime.

28:30.460 --> 28:33.005
Well, I'm gonna see that you pay more.

28:33.422 --> 28:35.632
I never touched that woman!

28:37.301 --> 28:41.096
And I'm not answerin' any more questions
without a lawyer.

28:43.140 --> 28:45.225
Get me a lawyer.

28:50.939 --> 28:52.733
Mulder?

28:52.816 --> 28:54.568
It's open.

28:54.651 --> 29:00.115
I have the results from the genetic testing of
the blood found under Verna Johnson's nails.

29:00.199 --> 29:02.284
They checked it against Cokely's.

29:02.409 --> 29:05.370
The PGM subtype matches.
The DQ Alpha and D1S80, too.

29:05.495 --> 29:09.291
- It's Cokely's blood?
- The results strongly suggest that.

29:09.374 --> 29:13.795
Imagine the strength of his psychosis,
driving him to murder after 50 years.

29:13.879 --> 29:18.175
- But for some reason he let BJ live.
- Well, she's not the first.

29:18.258 --> 29:22.304
Mrs Thibedeaux also survived his attack
back in 1945.

29:22.429 --> 29:25.682
I think it's time we paid a visit
to Mrs Thibedeaux.

29:36.818 --> 29:39.947
That was taken three weeks
before it happened.

29:43.116 --> 29:45.661
I haven't had a picture taken since.

29:48.163 --> 29:50.457
Is this your husband?

29:50.541 --> 29:53.710
That's Martin. He was a good man.

29:54.419 --> 29:56.255
He passed last June.

29:56.380 --> 29:59.675
If it hadn't been for him,
I never would have survived.

29:59.758 --> 30:01.718
I know this goes back a long way...

30:01.802 --> 30:05.681
...but could you tell us what happened
the night Cokely attacked you?

30:05.764 --> 30:07.683
It happened...

30:07.766 --> 30:09.476
...up there on the landing.

30:12.187 --> 30:16.233
I remember how the light from the window...

30:16.900 --> 30:18.986
...bounced off the razor.

30:19.695 --> 30:22.155
It had an ivory handle.

30:22.656 --> 30:24.658
He kept sayin'...

30:24.908 --> 30:29.788
..."Someone's gotta take the blame,
little sister, and it isn't gonna be me."

30:30.873 --> 30:35.252
They tried to explain at the trial
how his father used to beat him...

30:35.335 --> 30:40.924
...and how he was the only son
in a family of five daughters.

30:41.008 --> 30:44.845
And how he was brutally punished
for everything wrong that happened.

30:46.096 --> 30:47.973
But if you ask me...

30:48.557 --> 30:50.976
...that man was born evil.

30:52.019 --> 30:54.188
No children?

30:54.271 --> 30:56.690
No. None.

30:56.815 --> 31:02.029
Our records show that you recuperated
from your injuries within two months.

31:02.112 --> 31:05.407
But nine months later,
you checked back into the hospital.

31:05.908 --> 31:08.202
Well, I had complications.

31:10.412 --> 31:12.414
What happened to the child?

31:18.045 --> 31:19.588
Cokely's child.

31:21.798 --> 31:25.886
Martin used to say... not to blame the child.

31:26.011 --> 31:30.265
That it was just a little thing, an innocent.

31:31.934 --> 31:35.020
But it was the spawn of evil.

31:35.187 --> 31:38.941
I couldn't keep it in this house...

31:39.024 --> 31:40.984
...the memory of him.

31:44.821 --> 31:46.865
Mrs Thibedeaux?

31:49.076 --> 31:53.288
I gave the baby to an adoption agency.

31:54.039 --> 31:57.334
Baby... He'd be almost 50 now.

32:04.716 --> 32:09.054
This is the address of the adoption agency.

32:10.013 --> 32:12.099
If you do find him...

32:13.851 --> 32:15.936
No. No, never mind.

32:19.773 --> 32:25.153
The bones BJ found under the house
belonged to Chaney's partner, Ledbetter.

32:25.237 --> 32:27.364
Cokely rented the house in 1942.

32:27.447 --> 32:32.411
Detectives at the scene found an old razor
under the house. They're trying to lift prints.

32:32.494 --> 32:36.164
Cokely's been released,
but I think we have enough to nail him.

32:37.499 --> 32:39.585
Something just doesn't track.

32:39.668 --> 32:42.796
The night she was attacked,
BJ said she saw a younger man.

32:42.880 --> 32:47.009
You know her state of mind that night.
She could have been mistaken.

32:47.092 --> 32:51.263
Well, maybe she did see a younger man.
Young Cokely. Cokely's grandson.

32:51.930 --> 32:54.016
Cokely's grandson attacked BJ?

32:54.099 --> 32:57.769
It would make sense.
Genetic traits often skip a generation.

32:57.853 --> 33:01.732
That would explain the blood
under Verna Johnson's fingernails.

33:01.815 --> 33:04.651
PGM subtypes are similar among relatives.

33:04.776 --> 33:08.071
Did Danny call back
with the adoption records yet?

33:08.155 --> 33:13.493
I doubt Mendel had serial killers in mind
when he developed his theory on genetics.

33:14.661 --> 33:18.040
You know, when I was a kid,
I would have nightmares.

33:18.123 --> 33:23.462
I'd wake up in the night thinkin'
I was the only person left in the world.

33:23.545 --> 33:25.672
Then I would hear this.

33:26.715 --> 33:30.427
- What?
- My dad would be in the study eating these.

33:31.970 --> 33:34.181
Danny Valadeo? It's Agent Scully.

33:34.306 --> 33:36.642
What does that have to do with Cokely?

33:36.767 --> 33:41.104
On a cellular level, we're the sum total
of all our ancestors' biological matter.

33:41.188 --> 33:44.733
But what if more than biological traits
get passed down?

33:44.816 --> 33:49.196
What if I like sunflower seeds because
I'm genetically predisposed to liking them?

33:49.238 --> 33:54.368
Children aren't born liking sunflower seeds.
Behaviour patterns are taught.

33:54.451 --> 33:56.787
We hear of twins, separated at birth...

33:56.870 --> 34:01.041
...who end up in the same occupation,
each naming their child Waldo.

34:01.124 --> 34:02.125
Waldo?

34:02.209 --> 34:06.505
Jung wrote about the collective unconscious.
It's genetic memory.

34:07.548 --> 34:09.507
Yeah, Danny.

34:11.260 --> 34:14.513
Yeah. Thanks. I'll tell him.

34:15.389 --> 34:17.975
Danny tracked down Mrs Thibedeaux's son.

34:18.100 --> 34:20.686
He was a policeman
named Raymond Morrow.

34:21.478 --> 34:23.605
That's BJ's father.

34:23.688 --> 34:27.442
- BJ is Cokely's granddaughter.
- She's responsible for the murders.

34:27.525 --> 34:30.571
- Mulder...
- Get your coat. Let's go.

34:30.987 --> 34:36.243
- Wait. You think BJ's capable of murder?
- No, but Cokely is. BJ has become him.

34:36.326 --> 34:41.081
- That's outrageous!
- I think Cokely's memories, compulsions...

34:41.164 --> 34:44.877
...have been passed on genetically to BJ,
driving her to kill.

34:44.960 --> 34:49.130
So BJ's nightmares are real? She's killing
women and carving "sister" on them?

34:49.214 --> 34:50.882
Yes.

34:51.300 --> 34:55.387
- Then explain the cuts on her own chest.
- I can't. Maybe she did it herself.

34:55.469 --> 34:59.099
Maybe it's a weird stigmata.
Whatever it is, BJ's not herself.

35:00.475 --> 35:02.603
- Where to?
- To warn Mrs Thibedeaux.

35:02.686 --> 35:08.108
If BJ has become Cokely in the way I mean,
she may try to finish what Cokely started.

35:52.236 --> 35:53.820
Stop it!

35:54.196 --> 35:59.785
- Somebody's gotta take the blame, sister.
- No! No, no! You're not him! You can't be!

36:02.204 --> 36:04.623
And it's not gonna be me!

36:07.334 --> 36:09.962
I'm not afraid to use this.

36:13.131 --> 36:15.676
You have his eyes.

36:16.969 --> 36:18.720
You're...

36:18.846 --> 36:20.264
...him!

36:25.811 --> 36:26.895
No.

36:31.984 --> 36:33.777
You're my grandchild.

36:38.448 --> 36:41.034
- You know what you're doing?!
- Shut up!

36:48.917 --> 36:51.378
He's done this to both of us.

36:55.174 --> 36:56.425
No!

36:56.925 --> 36:59.469
You don't know what you're doing!

37:00.429 --> 37:02.723
He's the one to blame!

37:06.310 --> 37:08.312
Argh!

37:16.361 --> 37:18.739
Mrs Thibedeaux? Mrs Thibedeaux!

37:18.864 --> 37:20.616
Mulder...

37:21.533 --> 37:23.410
Mrs Thibedeaux!

37:24.286 --> 37:25.954
What happened?

37:26.038 --> 37:29.041
She had a razor. She tried to kill me.

37:29.124 --> 37:31.168
But something stopped her.

37:31.251 --> 37:33.754
- Where did she go?
- I don't know.

37:34.254 --> 37:37.090
- Can you stand?
- Yeah, I think so.

37:37.174 --> 37:40.052
- Let me help you up the stairs.
- Thank you.

37:40.135 --> 37:43.805
This is Agent Mulder. I need an ambulance
to 238 North 54th Street.

37:43.889 --> 37:46.350
I also need an APB on BJ Morrow.

37:46.725 --> 37:51.146
Yes, that's Detective Morrow. She should
be considered armed and dangerous.

37:51.230 --> 37:53.023
BJ's going after Tillman.

37:53.106 --> 37:57.236
The first murder occurred after BJ got
pregnant. She wants someone to blame.

37:57.319 --> 38:01.156
- I think that's Tillman.
- I don't think so. I think it'll be Cokely.

38:01.573 --> 38:04.243
- Why?
- She must know Cokely's her grandfather.

38:04.326 --> 38:06.703
If she wants someone to blame, it'll be him.

38:06.787 --> 38:10.707
Cokely's not answering his phone.
I'm goin' over there.

38:19.091 --> 38:21.009
She had a reason.

38:21.093 --> 38:23.637
- We've gotta talk.
- We're getting a statement.

38:23.720 --> 38:26.265
- You've accused BJ of murder?
- Let's go outside.

38:26.348 --> 38:29.351
- No. Here, now!
- Have you seen Detective Morrow?

38:29.434 --> 38:34.189
No! But I don't care what you've accused
her of. She could not hurt anybody.

38:34.273 --> 38:37.276
Detective Morrow
attacked this woman with a razor.

38:37.401 --> 38:40.571
- Come on! I do not believe that!
- It's true.

38:41.405 --> 38:43.490
It happened.

38:45.367 --> 38:48.996
I only acted like any husband
who didn't want to see his home broken up.

38:49.079 --> 38:52.124
- What home?
- Remember the home I promised you?

39:49.640 --> 39:51.308
Who's there?

40:13.330 --> 40:14.915
Cokely?

40:20.212 --> 40:22.214
Who's there?

40:28.554 --> 40:30.222
No.

40:34.852 --> 40:38.814
How does it feel to be
on the other side of the razor, brother?

40:38.939 --> 40:42.442
Shut up!

40:49.908 --> 40:52.327
No... No!

40:54.872 --> 40:56.874
Please, no!

40:57.708 --> 41:02.504
You know the rules.
This doesn't stop till you're dead.

41:16.351 --> 41:17.853
Cokely!

41:26.403 --> 41:28.030
Cokely?

42:00.854 --> 42:03.065
No, don't. BJ.

42:06.026 --> 42:07.027
Don't.

42:08.153 --> 42:09.238
Don't.

42:13.200 --> 42:14.826
No!

42:14.910 --> 42:17.120
This time you'll stay dead!

42:18.247 --> 42:20.207
- Freeze!
- BJ!

42:20.874 --> 42:23.877
- What are you doin'?
- Let him go.

42:25.420 --> 42:27.464
Let him go, BJ!

42:29.049 --> 42:31.051
I'm not BJ.

42:32.135 --> 42:34.179
Yes, you are.

42:59.872 --> 43:01.707
He's dead.

43:11.216 --> 43:12.342
Come on.

43:25.230 --> 43:28.817
It's all right. It's gonna be all right.
It's gonna be OK.

43:32.029 --> 43:35.741
We are continuing
with genetic testing on Detective Morrow.

43:35.824 --> 43:41.330
Evidence suggests the presence of a mutator
gene that has activated dormant genes.

43:41.413 --> 43:44.708
But the results so far are inconclusive.

43:47.961 --> 43:52.966
Detective Morrow has not demonstrated
any further physiological changes.

43:53.050 --> 43:56.887
Extensive blood work and
psychological testing has been conducted...

43:57.012 --> 44:02.392
...to determine whether the pregnancy could
have been a catalyst for the transformation.

44:03.310 --> 44:06.730
We have yet to determine
the effects on the foetus.

44:07.231 --> 44:11.151
Amniocentesis results
show no genetic abnormalities.

44:11.235 --> 44:15.364
Chromosome testing has determined
the child's sex to be male.

44:16.281 --> 44:19.117
BJ is on her second week of suicide watch...

44:19.201 --> 44:22.371
...after an unsuccessful attempt
to abort her son.

44:22.996 --> 44:26.375
Lieutenant Tillman
has petitioned to adopt the child...

44:26.458 --> 44:29.753
...and the case
will soon be presented to the courts.

44:33.053 --> 44:38.180
