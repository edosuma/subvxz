[DJ] <i>If I could do something different,</i>
<i>I'd come back to high school, man.</i>

00:16.140 --> 00:18.893
<i>I mean, I had a whole bunch</i>
<i>of Division I offers.</i>

00:19.519 --> 00:23.022
<i>So, if I would've came to class</i>
<i>instead of skipping class...</i>

00:24.023 --> 00:26.192
{\an8}nothing would have stopped me then, but...

00:27.318 --> 00:29.320
{\an8}I messed up. I dug a hole.

00:29.404 --> 00:31.114
{\an8}Gotta climb out of it.

00:31.197 --> 00:33.742
Ain't how you fall,
it's how you get up, man.

00:35.535 --> 00:38.121
Ain't how you fall,
it's how you get up, you know?

00:39.289 --> 00:40.915
You can't change the past.

00:41.708 --> 00:43.001
[chuckles]

00:44.878 --> 00:46.713
[Daniel] <i>Brings back</i>
<i>a lot of memories, man.</i>

00:47.380 --> 00:49.090
Lot of good games
played on this field out here.

00:49.174 --> 00:51.176
-Lot of real good games.
-That's when the game was live, though,

00:51.259 --> 00:52.260
when I was a little boy.

00:52.343 --> 00:54.512
Everybody was out here.
The whole hood was out here, then.

00:54.596 --> 00:57.348
I'm talking about the whole hood
was out here. Everybody.

00:58.224 --> 01:00.268
[Daniel] This where it went down at.
Right here, man.

01:01.436 --> 01:03.938
[DJ] A hundred touchdowns,
ran on this field.

01:08.860 --> 01:10.487
[Daniel] You only get
one shot at life, man.

01:10.570 --> 01:13.406
[stutters] Ain't no rewinding back time.
Ain't no do-overs.

01:13.490 --> 01:14.991
You get one shot at it, man.

01:15.909 --> 01:17.911
It's about the choices you make.

01:18.953 --> 01:20.830
You're makin' the right ones, son.

01:22.957 --> 01:25.293
[marching band playing]

01:53.822 --> 01:56.032

[DJ] <i>This right here</i>
<i>is Martin Luther King Jr. street.</i>

02:25.937 --> 02:30.150
This street has been the most
famous street growing up, you know?

02:31.192 --> 02:33.069
I mean,
everything went down on this street.

02:33.153 --> 02:37.866
Every Friday night... I heard gunshots,
seen people pull out guns, shoot.

02:37.949 --> 02:41.828
I mean... And I'm walking
the same street every day.

02:43.705 --> 02:46.166
[Napoleon Harris] <i>Majority of the</i>
<i>young men that stay in this community,</i>

02:46.249 --> 02:48.501
<i>that don't go off to college</i>
<i>or to the military,</i>

02:48.585 --> 02:50.795
<i>some way,</i>
<i>they end up in the penal system.</i>

02:50.879 --> 02:54.424
{\an8}There are so many young, young men
that had an opportunity

02:54.507 --> 02:56.676
{\an8}to make it out of, uh, Haines City.

02:56.759 --> 02:58.261
{\an8}<i>Shykeem Pitts.</i>

02:59.178 --> 03:00.346
{\an8}<i>Very talented young man.</i>

03:00.430 --> 03:02.473
<i>Very, very respectful.</i>

03:02.557 --> 03:04.517
But got into an incident

03:04.601 --> 03:06.936
that stopped him
from going to Marshall University.

03:07.020 --> 03:10.440
<i>So being that that was a problem,</i>
<i>he moved back home.</i>

03:10.523 --> 03:14.485
And when he moved back home,
he became one of the guys on the corner.

03:14.569 --> 03:17.155
And being that he became
one of the guys on the corner,

03:17.238 --> 03:19.699
he met fate,
and fate being death.

03:20.783 --> 03:23.119
[DJ] <i>He was a big legend</i>
<i>around here, you know.</i>

03:23.202 --> 03:25.830
Everybody respected him.
Everybody loved him.

03:25.914 --> 03:29.042
The guy was funny, great, loving.

03:29.125 --> 03:32.378
Cared for anybody, man.
Would do anything for anybody, man.

03:32.462 --> 03:33.504
He was a great guy.

03:33.588 --> 03:35.089
{\an8}<i>Great football player.</i>

03:35.173 --> 03:36.549
{\an8}<i>Somebody I always looked up to.</i>

03:36.633 --> 03:37.842
{\an8}<i>I seen him do moves in Little League</i>

03:37.926 --> 03:40.970
{\an8}<i>that, man, I've been</i>
<i>copying since his days,</i>

03:41.054 --> 03:42.680
{\an8}like me jumping over people.

03:42.764 --> 03:44.891
{\an8}<i>That ain't coming from me first.</i>
<i>It came from Shykeem.</i>

03:44.974 --> 03:47.727
{\an8}<i>I've seen him jump over a guy</i>
<i>in Little League and I just thought,</i>

03:47.810 --> 03:49.437
"Man, that guy..." [exhales]

03:50.396 --> 03:52.774
And now, ever since then,
I've just been looking up to that guy.

03:52.857 --> 03:54.734
Looking up to that guy and then...

03:55.193 --> 03:58.029
For him to like...
[stutters] He's gone.

03:58.780 --> 04:00.990
<i>At a early age, you know.</i>

04:01.074 --> 04:04.577
<i>I took it kinda hard because,</i>
<i>you know, that's somebody I looked up to.</i>

04:04.661 --> 04:08.498
And just... It just made me realize
that life is real, you know.

04:08.581 --> 04:11.960
It just showed me life is real
and there's something I gotta do.

04:12.043 --> 04:13.461
Something I gotta do.

04:13.544 --> 04:16.505
Football is something I gotta do
to get up out...

04:16.589 --> 04:18.048
get up out of here.

04:18.132 --> 04:20.677
This my home,
but it's something I gotta do.

04:47.287 --> 04:49.455
[Wagner] <i>Y'all are fixin' to have</i>
<i>to get out when DJ gets in here,</i>

04:49.539 --> 04:50.915
so you better hurry up and finish.

04:51.833 --> 04:53.751
'Cause you don't wanna hear
what I'm about to say.

04:53.835 --> 04:55.336
[player 1] I'mma laugh.
[player 2] I wanna hear it.

04:55.420 --> 04:57.130
[Wagner] <i>I think he has me blocked.</i>

04:57.213 --> 04:58.548
'Cause when I call,
it goes straight to voicemail.

04:58.631 --> 05:00.466
When Kate calls him, it rings.

05:00.550 --> 05:02.093
[player 1]
You're not gonna find him, bro.

05:02.176 --> 05:04.595
If his phone's going to voicemail,
it's over with.

05:04.679 --> 05:05.722
[player 2 chuckles]

05:05.805 --> 05:07.682
[Wagner] DJ, come in here.

05:07.765 --> 05:11.060
I have to talk to you
about your academics. Period.

05:11.144 --> 05:12.103
[DJ] We'll talk later.

05:12.186 --> 05:14.480
No. We're not talking later.
We're talking now.

05:14.564 --> 05:15.940
[DJ] Then send me home.

05:18.318 --> 05:20.445
DJ. Come on.

05:22.572 --> 05:24.615
[DJ] Leave me alone.
Fuck this shit.

05:24.699 --> 05:27.660
[Wagner] What are you talking about?
Come in my office.

05:31.372 --> 05:32.623
Stop.

05:33.541 --> 05:36.085
There's no reason, come on.

05:36.169 --> 05:37.295
Come on.

05:38.337 --> 05:41.007
No reason.

05:49.974 --> 05:51.142
All right, look.

05:54.812 --> 05:57.315
This is the last grade report I got.

06:01.360 --> 06:02.695
Look at me.

06:03.613 --> 06:06.199
This is a very real situation

06:06.282 --> 06:09.035
that we have to figure out
how to deal with.

06:10.745 --> 06:12.789
You cannot run from this.

06:17.043 --> 06:19.796
If you run and you quit...

06:20.755 --> 06:22.256
what are you gonna do?

06:23.966 --> 06:26.469
Think about it.
Where are you gonna go?

06:30.807 --> 06:34.977
Are you afraid of putting forth effort
and then still failing?

06:37.522 --> 06:39.107
Something like that.

06:41.109 --> 06:43.444
Have you tried to put forth effort?

06:45.446 --> 06:48.491
I mean, honestly,
like, the other day,

06:48.574 --> 06:51.160
when you were typing the English essay
in there with Miss--

06:51.244 --> 06:53.538
When we had you in the computer lab
and you were typing the essay,

06:53.621 --> 06:55.998
did you try that day?

06:56.082 --> 06:57.291
[DJ sighs]

06:57.375 --> 06:58.668
I think you tried.

07:00.128 --> 07:01.170
Didn't you?

07:01.254 --> 07:02.505
[DJ] Why do you say that?

07:02.588 --> 07:04.006
[Wagner] Because it was a good essay.

07:05.049 --> 07:06.551
I think when you try...

07:07.468 --> 07:09.095
it scares you a little bit.

07:10.763 --> 07:13.141
Because then
you're gonna get your hopes up.

07:13.224 --> 07:14.517
[cell phone beeps and vibrates]

07:14.600 --> 07:16.394
That maybe you can do it.

07:17.311 --> 07:20.815
And then when you get your hopes up...

07:22.859 --> 07:24.318
and you're excited about it,

07:24.402 --> 07:26.112
and you're excited
about the possibility,

07:26.195 --> 07:27.905
what happens if you're disappointed?

07:31.325 --> 07:33.202
And you don't think you can handle that.

07:33.286 --> 07:35.621
You don't think
you can handle that disappointment.

07:35.705 --> 07:39.083
So the alternative to that is,
"Well, I just won't try.

07:41.544 --> 07:44.964
And then I just know I won't make it
and then I won't be disappointed."

07:47.216 --> 07:48.926
-[sighs]
-Is that what we're doin'?

07:55.016 --> 07:56.517
Am I right?

07:56.601 --> 07:57.768
[chuckles]

07:59.187 --> 08:01.147
Something like that.

08:05.359 --> 08:07.320
DJ, you have to care.

08:19.957 --> 08:22.335
[DJ] <i>Everybody loves Miss Wagner.</i>

08:22.418 --> 08:24.962
<i>It's pretty much like a big family</i>
<i>and she's like the mother.</i>

08:25.046 --> 08:27.256
<i>She also cares a lot, you know.</i>

08:27.340 --> 08:30.092
But, at the same time, you can't tell
if somebody cares about you,

08:30.176 --> 08:31.511
if they really care.

08:31.594 --> 08:32.929
I know football is a business.

08:33.011 --> 08:34.679
It's their job to have me stay here.

08:34.764 --> 08:36.224
[stutters] I don't know
if they really care or not,

08:36.307 --> 08:40.311
<i>but it's a game you have to play</i>
<i>to get where you wanna go.</i>

08:41.187 --> 08:43.688
<i>Number one stress on my mind</i>
<i>is making it.</i>

08:43.773 --> 08:46.526
<i>Making it to the league</i>
<i>and making it in life.</i>

08:46.609 --> 08:47.902
<i>It came in high school.</i>

08:47.985 --> 08:50.112
"Okay, man, you can make it to the NFL,
you can make it to the--"

08:50.196 --> 08:53.449
I'm like, "Okay."
I ain't take it serious,

08:53.533 --> 08:56.410
but after a while, enough people
were telling me the same thing.

08:56.494 --> 08:59.247
<i>"You can make it to the NFL.</i>
<i>You can make it to the NFL."</i>

08:59.330 --> 09:01.791
<i>I mean, people say that all the time</i>
<i>from back home.</i>

09:01.874 --> 09:04.377
<i>It puts a lot of pressure on me</i>
<i>'cause, like, if I quit,</i>

09:04.460 --> 09:06.921
then I know I go back home.

09:07.004 --> 09:09.382
Everybody, everybody...

09:09.465 --> 09:11.050
talking, talk, talk, talk.

09:12.051 --> 09:13.219
Mmm-mmm.

09:23.688 --> 09:26.023
[Wood] <i>Then he promoted Mordecai</i>
<i>into that same seat.</i>

09:26.107 --> 09:29.860
Mordecai then sends out a decree
that saved all the Jewish people.

09:29.944 --> 09:31.612
Point to the story is this.

09:32.738 --> 09:34.907
How do you know you're not here
for such a time as this?

09:34.991 --> 09:37.159
How do you know you're not here
for such a time as this?

09:37.243 --> 09:38.744
What's my job here?
Don't know.

09:38.828 --> 09:41.706
Maybe my job is to talk to you
a little bit every week about the Bible.

09:41.789 --> 09:44.166
Maybe my job is to try
to set a good example for you.

09:44.250 --> 09:46.252
Maybe my job's
more than just calling plays.

09:46.335 --> 09:48.671
Maybe your job's more than
just coming to football practice.

09:48.754 --> 09:51.340
Maybe it's a lot of going to class
and doing other things as well.

09:52.341 --> 09:55.636
But how do you know that you weren't
called here for such a time as this?

09:55.720 --> 09:57.805
We have a chance,
right now, this week,

09:57.888 --> 10:00.600
to play for our seventh
North Division title.

10:00.683 --> 10:02.643
That's how big this game is.

10:02.727 --> 10:04.729
It's right in front of you
to do what you want to do.

10:04.812 --> 10:06.731
It's right in front of you
to accomplish the goals

10:06.814 --> 10:07.857
that you came here to accomplish.

10:07.940 --> 10:09.525
You wanted to win championships?

10:09.609 --> 10:11.152
You're in a position to do that now.

10:13.404 --> 10:14.405
[Clifton Collins] <i>This week, guys,</i>

10:14.488 --> 10:17.241
{\an8}we got a good fucking football team
coming in to whoop your ass.

10:17.325 --> 10:19.160
{\an8}They're ranked ahead of us.
They undefeated.

10:19.243 --> 10:23.164
<i>Probably gonna end up facing these guys</i>
<i>somewhere again in a championship.</i>

10:24.290 --> 10:27.418
[Williams] <i>All your dreams</i>
<i>that we had at the beginning of the season</i>

10:27.501 --> 10:31.005
can still possibly come true
if you do your job.

10:31.088 --> 10:33.549
[Lesley] <i>Big-time players</i>
<i>make big-time plays in big-time games.</i>

10:33.633 --> 10:34.759
<i>That's just the way it is.</i>

10:34.842 --> 10:36.135
<i>And we'll have to make some plays.</i>

10:36.218 --> 10:38.054
It's the best offense we've faced by far.

10:38.137 --> 10:39.680
Probably will be the best one you'll face.

10:39.764 --> 10:41.474
[Williams] <i>Do y'all know</i>
<i>if y'all win this game,</i>

10:41.557 --> 10:43.643
you gonna host two games
in the playoffs?

10:43.726 --> 10:45.061
Does that mean anything to y'all?

10:45.144 --> 10:46.854
-[player] Fuckin' right.
-Okay.

10:46.979 --> 10:47.980
[player] Ain't gotta go nowhere.

10:48.064 --> 10:49.190
-[players laugh]
-All right. You right.

10:55.363 --> 10:56.739
[Wyatt] <i>Oh, yeah,</i>
<i>can't wait for the game.</i>

10:56.822 --> 10:58.240
<i>That's the biggest game of the year.</i>

10:58.324 --> 10:59.325
You know, we got a lot to prove.

10:59.408 --> 11:02.036
They, uh...
Some people got 'em ranked number one

11:02.119 --> 11:05.039
and they talkin' a lot
so it's gonna be a fun one.

11:05.122 --> 11:06.666
<i>It's the kind you like to play.</i>

11:08.250 --> 11:10.044
<i>If we don't play really good,</i>
<i>we'll get beat.</i>

11:10.127 --> 11:11.545
<i>They got one of the best</i>
<i>running backs in the state.</i>

11:11.629 --> 11:15.132
[Lesley] That's probably the best player
overall in the league.

11:15.216 --> 11:16.217
It's you and him.

11:16.300 --> 11:19.637
We gotta make tackles, guys.
Gotta make tackles.

11:19.720 --> 11:21.972
Against the toughest
son of a bitch to tackle.

11:22.056 --> 11:24.475
He's fast as a motherfucker, too.

11:24.558 --> 11:26.644
They was trying to compare him
to me last year.

11:26.727 --> 11:28.813
{\an8}Effort, guys. Effort.

11:28.896 --> 11:32.191
{\an8}We can't sit back and just think
that it's gonna fall into our lap.

11:32.274 --> 11:33.734
<i>We gotta go make it happen.</i>

11:33.818 --> 11:34.985
[Collins] <i>Guys, we gotta work.</i>

11:35.069 --> 11:36.695
<i>When we do that, guys, we're good.</i>

11:42.827 --> 11:44.036
<i>Come on. Come on, Ollie.</i>
<i>Come on, Ollie.</i>

11:44.120 --> 11:45.663
<i>I need you to work.</i>
<i>Come on. Come on.</i>

11:45.746 --> 11:46.956
-Come on! All the way up.
-[grunting]

11:47.039 --> 11:48.666
Come on, man.
Stop bullshittin'.

11:48.749 --> 11:52.253
[Lesley] <i>Gotta have 110%</i>
<i>of everything you do this week.</i>

11:52.336 --> 11:55.047
Okay, if you need extra motivation
for this game,

11:55.131 --> 11:56.424
guys, this ain't the sport for you.

11:56.507 --> 11:58.384
<i>-These are the ones you live for, okay?</i>
-[panting]

11:58.467 --> 12:00.803
<i>These are the ones you ask for,</i>
<i>these are the ones you want.</i>

12:00.886 --> 12:02.555
[Collins] <i>Take pride in it, guys.</i>

12:02.638 --> 12:04.390
<i>Give a shit about it.</i>
<i>Care about it.</i>

12:04.473 --> 12:06.225
<i>If you do that,</i>
<i>everything gonna be fine.</i>

12:06.976 --> 12:09.061
But you gotta fucking care about it.

12:11.522 --> 12:12.773
[players chuckle]

12:14.692 --> 12:16.235
[Marcel] This is good shit
by Ollie, right here, Coach.

12:16.318 --> 12:18.028
-Boom!
-[Williams] Running to the ball,

12:18.112 --> 12:20.281
that's a good job.
Good play right there, Ollie.

12:20.364 --> 12:21.740
Appreciate it, Coach.

12:21.824 --> 12:23.033
You're showing your hands,
you're staying low,

12:23.117 --> 12:24.702
ball come in side to side,

12:24.785 --> 12:26.620
you shrug, release, and make a play.

12:26.704 --> 12:31.292
You can play this game, Ollie,
but you gotta do it consistently.

12:31.375 --> 12:33.085
<i>Ollie missed three games</i>

12:33.169 --> 12:35.504
and for him,
missing those three games, you know...

12:35.588 --> 12:37.339
of course,
he would get a little frustrated

12:37.423 --> 12:39.508
'cause he feel like
time is running out on him.

12:39.592 --> 12:42.761
[stutters] <i>He wanted to sign.</i>
<i>He wanted to go Division I.</i>

12:42.845 --> 12:45.723
<i>Anytime you miss three games</i>
<i>out of the nine-game season,</i>

12:45.806 --> 12:47.057
<i>there's not much for him out there.</i>

12:47.141 --> 12:48.851
<i>There's not...</i>
[stutters] <i>That's three games</i>

12:48.934 --> 12:51.479
<i>that people are not able</i>
<i>to evaluate you, you know.</i>

12:51.562 --> 12:53.647
So we just try to reiterate to 'em, man,

12:53.731 --> 12:55.274
the best situation for them to do...

12:55.357 --> 12:56.358
[Lesley] Last set!

12:56.442 --> 12:57.943
[Williams] <i>...is stick it out, you know.</i>

12:58.027 --> 13:01.780
<i>And hopefully playing really, really well</i>
<i>toward the last couple of ball games.</i>

13:04.617 --> 13:06.452
[Wagner stuttering] <i>Ollie,</i>
<i>we are reading this story.</i>

13:06.535 --> 13:07.578
[Ollie] <i>I'm not.</i>
[Wagner] <i>Yes, you are.</i>

13:07.661 --> 13:08.913
<i>You don't have class till 9:30.</i>

13:08.996 --> 13:11.624
-It's 8:52.
-Man, you know how long that story is?

13:11.707 --> 13:14.001
[Wagner] I'm gonna read it so fast,
I'm gonna make it so interesting.

13:14.084 --> 13:15.836
I'll even do, like, voices.

13:15.920 --> 13:17.922
-Like voice-overs.
-Please, please, please don't.

13:18.005 --> 13:19.965
-Like I do when I read to my child.
-[chuckles]

13:20.049 --> 13:21.383
[Ollie] I say, we'll come back later
or something.

13:21.467 --> 13:22.760
[CJ] When's the ceremony?

13:22.843 --> 13:23.969
[Wagner] December 11th.

13:24.970 --> 13:26.514
Classes end on Thursday,
the ceremony is on--

13:26.597 --> 13:28.724
-Ronald Ollie, get back in here.
-[players chuckling]

13:29.725 --> 13:31.060
[player] No.

13:31.143 --> 13:33.604
-You too big to be sneaking off.
-You're too big to be sneaking around.

13:33.729 --> 13:35.105
-[player] Can I go?
-[players talking indistinctly]

13:35.189 --> 13:37.775
-You hit everybody. [laughing]
-[players laughing]

13:37.858 --> 13:39.026
Boom! Boom! Boom!

13:39.109 --> 13:40.402
[Wagner] Jay, close the door.

13:40.486 --> 13:43.656
This will never happen.
Close the door, please.

13:43.739 --> 13:45.658
Jay Johnson, stay.
We're reading this story.

13:45.741 --> 13:46.951
-Give me that phone.
-[Jay stuttering]

13:47.034 --> 13:48.911
[Wagner] Close the door.

13:48.994 --> 13:50.621
All right. He out.

13:50.704 --> 13:52.122
[Wagner] All right, we're ready?

13:52.206 --> 13:53.999
[reading] "Morning of June 27th

13:54.083 --> 13:56.919
was clear and sunny
with fresh warmth of a full summer day.

13:57.002 --> 13:58.337
People of the village... "

13:58.420 --> 13:59.880
"Village," keyword.

13:59.964 --> 14:01.840
"...began to gather in the square.

14:01.924 --> 14:05.427
The women, wearing
faded house dresses and sweaters,

14:05.511 --> 14:07.012
came shortly after the men.

14:07.096 --> 14:09.390
They greeted one another,
exchanged bits of gossip

14:09.473 --> 14:11.976
as they went to join their husbands.

14:12.059 --> 14:13.936
Soon the women
standing by their husbands..."

14:14.019 --> 14:17.606
<i>You know, our teachers</i>
<i>are very aware of the importance</i>

14:17.690 --> 14:19.400
of, you know, these guys passing

14:19.483 --> 14:22.319
and passing with
the highest grade they can get and...

14:22.403 --> 14:24.071
I mean, they're aware of that.

14:24.154 --> 14:26.782
But nobody's giving it away.

14:26.866 --> 14:27.867
[chuckles]

14:27.950 --> 14:29.201
I don't want 'em to give it away.

14:29.285 --> 14:32.162
<i>But they know, his teachers know</i>
<i>that he's, you know,</i>

14:32.246 --> 14:33.539
<i>good and got opportunities</i>

14:33.622 --> 14:35.833
<i>and he's got an opportunity</i>
<i>to better his life.</i>

14:35.916 --> 14:37.710
[stammers] <i>But at the end of the day,</i>

14:37.793 --> 14:40.546
the part of you being on time
and going and sitting there

14:40.629 --> 14:42.548
and halfway acting interested?

14:42.631 --> 14:45.676
That you can do.
Anybody can do that.

14:47.094 --> 14:48.470
Anybody can do that.

14:49.430 --> 14:51.056
And you do that

14:51.140 --> 14:54.810
and you're setting yourself up for,
you know, at least a chance.

14:55.769 --> 14:59.189
What three examples are you
thinking about using for your irony pair?

14:59.273 --> 15:00.274
Oh, uh...

15:00.357 --> 15:04.069
I don't know. I had lost my other sheet,
the one I had highlighted all the...

15:04.153 --> 15:05.988
All right, so just
make yourself little notes.

15:06.071 --> 15:08.449
Irony. All right?

15:08.532 --> 15:11.869
What else did we talk about in class
that was ironic?

15:11.952 --> 15:14.747
How should a husband feel toward his wife?

15:14.830 --> 15:17.541
[stammers] He shouldn't wanna lose
or kill her or something.

15:17.625 --> 15:19.293
-Right.
-Yeah.

15:19.376 --> 15:23.547
I mean, if somebody messes
with your wife, when you get one...

15:23.631 --> 15:24.673
[chuckles]

15:24.757 --> 15:26.842
-Yeah.
-...you'll try to protect her.

15:26.926 --> 15:28.510
-[Ollie mumbles] Yeah, right.
-All right.

15:28.594 --> 15:32.723
So those are some of the ironies
that we talked about in class.

15:32.806 --> 15:33.807
So...

15:42.942 --> 15:43.984
[Collins] <i>All right, man.</i>

15:44.068 --> 15:46.153
<i>Mmm, shit, you gotta get your education,</i>
<i>then reality'll set in.</i>

15:46.236 --> 15:47.279
[players talking indistinctly]

15:47.363 --> 15:50.449
You ain't got that many years of football.
Ain't nobody out here got no...

15:50.532 --> 15:52.201
[coach] Darnall.

15:52.284 --> 15:54.078
[coach] Like 20, at least 15 years.

15:54.161 --> 15:56.288
[player 1] I said 15, yeah.
[player 2] Fifteen.

15:56.372 --> 15:58.290
[player 3] Fifteen, if you great.
[player 4] If you great.

15:58.374 --> 16:01.627
That's, yeah,
that's hall-of-fame status.

16:01.710 --> 16:04.505
[CJ] For the league... The average time
in the league is like three years, bro.

16:04.588 --> 16:06.757
-Mmm-mmm, nah, it's less than that.
-[CJ] Well, it was three years.

16:06.840 --> 16:08.550
It was, this last...
It's, like, one-point...

16:08.634 --> 16:09.718
-A half a year.
-[CJ] Oh.

16:09.802 --> 16:10.803
Year and a half.

16:11.929 --> 16:13.305
Lot of guys get a chance.

16:13.389 --> 16:14.723
That's the good thing about JUCO.

16:14.807 --> 16:17.643
[stutters] It can make you or break you.

16:18.352 --> 16:21.105
[Wood] There's my guy. I've been waiting
on it. I can breathe.

16:21.188 --> 16:22.189
[Ollie] Coach Collins, listen.

16:22.272 --> 16:23.607
-I'm listening.
-I love you, bro.

16:23.691 --> 16:25.401
-I love you, too. Now get in.
-[grunts]

16:25.484 --> 16:27.653
Come on, Coach, don't just...

16:27.736 --> 16:29.071
[groans] I'm in, I'm in, I'm in, I'm in.

16:29.154 --> 16:30.614
-You going in? You going in?
-I'm in, I'm in, I'm in.

16:30.698 --> 16:33.409
I'm in, I'm in, I'm in,
I'm in, I'm in, I'm in.

16:33.492 --> 16:34.618
-[Wood] Put him in there.
-[Ollie grunting]

16:34.702 --> 16:35.703
[player] Ollie's gonna do
a good job, huh?

16:35.786 --> 16:37.788
-All right, Ollie? There.
-[groans]

16:37.871 --> 16:39.415
[Wood] Sit down in it, dog!
[Collins] Ollie.

16:39.498 --> 16:40.791
[player] Go run a lap, then do it.

16:40.874 --> 16:42.251
Yeah, I'mma run a lap.
Lemme go run a lap.

16:42.334 --> 16:45.129
Ollie, Ollie... No, we don't want you...
We ran enough in the summers.

16:45.212 --> 16:46.255
Hell yeah, we did.

16:46.338 --> 16:48.048
-[Collins] Okay. Watch your mouth, okay?
-[groaning]

16:48.132 --> 16:49.133
[Wood and players laughing]

16:49.216 --> 16:51.093
Oh, no. Coach Collins,
Coach Collins, bro!

16:51.176 --> 16:52.177
[yelling] Coach Collins!

16:52.261 --> 16:53.971
[screaming]

16:57.891 --> 16:59.935
-[player 2] Hey, shut up, man.
-[players laughing]

17:01.979 --> 17:03.522
[laughing]

17:05.023 --> 17:06.775
[laughing]

17:10.779 --> 17:12.031
[Buddy] <i>I'm embarrassed.</i>

17:12.114 --> 17:13.781
<i>But when punches were thrown,</i>

17:13.866 --> 17:15.701
<i>-I should've done something else.</i>
-[indistinct yelling]

17:15.784 --> 17:20.414
And sometimes, I've found that
I like to blow things up

17:20.497 --> 17:22.915
instead of trying to dismantle it.

17:23.000 --> 17:28.672
And instead of sitting back
and trying to... assess the situation,

17:28.756 --> 17:29.923
I just blew up.

17:30.007 --> 17:32.718
<i>And got mad.</i>

17:32.801 --> 17:34.219
<i>Um, everybody wants to...</i>

17:34.303 --> 17:36.055
<i>wants to change for good.</i>

17:36.138 --> 17:38.891
<i>I've done a lot of soul searching,</i>
<i>a lot of praying.</i>

17:38.974 --> 17:40.184
<i>I've tried reading more.</i>

17:40.267 --> 17:42.519
I've tried doing a little bit more of, uh,

17:42.603 --> 17:45.773
making sure that, um,
I try to work on my temper,

17:45.856 --> 17:48.817
work on being calm,
as you can see.

17:48.901 --> 17:52.780
And, um, I had an opportunity
to read this quote.

17:52.863 --> 17:54.531
And it was by the Dalai Lama.

17:54.615 --> 17:58.368
"Don't let someone else's misbehavior
affect your peace of mind."

17:58.452 --> 18:02.790
And that, to me,
has meant a tremendous amount.

18:02.873 --> 18:05.918
[Wood] Guys, I'd like to introduce you to
our new head coach, Coach Buddy Stephens.

18:06.001 --> 18:07.503
-He'll be taking over.
-Thank you very much. Thank you.

18:07.586 --> 18:09.171
-[players cheering]
-Thank you very much. Thank you.

18:09.254 --> 18:10.756
[Wood] Kind of mixed,
kind of mixed.

18:10.839 --> 18:12.674
[Buddy] All right.
All right.

18:12.758 --> 18:15.177
I am so proud of the way
you've played the last two weeks,

18:15.260 --> 18:16.804
we're moving forward.

18:16.887 --> 18:18.263
But we're gonna move forward
as a team now.

18:18.347 --> 18:23.143
From here on, this week on,
we gotta all be in.

18:23.227 --> 18:26.063
Coleman, Tillman, Ollie, Andry,
played your butt off.

18:26.146 --> 18:27.189
Played your butt off.

18:27.272 --> 18:30.275
The whole defensive line
played well all night long.

18:30.359 --> 18:34.321
[stutters] I will win championships
with guys like that.

18:34.404 --> 18:36.824
I will win championships
with unselfish guys

18:36.907 --> 18:39.827
that have one goal in mind,
that is to win a championship

18:39.910 --> 18:41.829
and to know that that championship

18:41.912 --> 18:44.456
will help them get the scholarships
that they need.

18:44.540 --> 18:46.583
This team's a dominant-ass team now.

18:46.667 --> 18:48.502
This is a dominant team.

18:48.585 --> 18:51.213
We'll have all hands on board this week.

18:51.296 --> 18:53.590
-DJ's laying down the law again this week.
-[players] Hey!

18:53.674 --> 18:55.592
[Buddy] You know what I'm saying?
He's gonna lay down the law.

18:55.676 --> 18:56.677
And let me tell you something,

18:56.760 --> 18:59.555
when we just start doing our thing,
they can't stop us.

19:19.950 --> 19:21.702
-[music playing over headphones]
-[indistinct chatter]

19:26.790 --> 19:28.792
-You ready?
-Hell yeah.

19:28.876 --> 19:30.460
Ready?

19:30.544 --> 19:32.004
-Am I?
-Oof.

19:32.087 --> 19:33.672
My first year of Little League, bro,

19:33.755 --> 19:36.884
I had fractured my bone on my foot.
I was out for six weeks.

19:36.967 --> 19:38.468
First play back,
60-yard touchdown.

19:38.552 --> 19:41.680
Sprayed on they ass.
[chuckles] Sprayed.

19:41.763 --> 19:44.766
-That's too long, dawg.
-Sprayed, man.

19:44.850 --> 19:47.686
Everybody keep sayin', first play.
I don't know about first play.

19:47.811 --> 19:50.898
But I know I'm gonna spray some of mine.
I'm gonna spray on some shit.

19:51.857 --> 19:53.609
You wearin' a knee brace?

19:53.692 --> 19:54.735
[Buddy] <i>You got an opportunity tonight,</i>

19:54.818 --> 19:57.654
to go out and shut a lot of people up.
You understand?

19:57.738 --> 20:00.449
You go out and you do what we do
and you play free, all right?

20:00.532 --> 20:02.576
You play relaxed,
you play our football

20:02.659 --> 20:04.286
and you get after their rear-end,
you understand?

20:04.369 --> 20:05.370
-[players] Yes, sir.
-Our father...

20:05.454 --> 20:07.039

-I wasn't gonna miss the second one!

28:25.412 --> 28:27.330
Hey, hey, hey, hey, sit down, sit down.
Get off your feet.

28:27.414 --> 28:29.040
Hey, come here, Ollie,
come here and sit your--

28:29.124 --> 28:30.458
[Ollie] Whoo!

28:31.459 --> 28:32.627
Whoo!

28:33.962 --> 28:38.216
In front of my fucking brother, man.
That's what the fuck I'm talking about.

28:38.299 --> 28:39.300
The fuck, bro.

28:39.384 --> 28:40.385
[Williams] Hey, come on,
sit down, man.

28:40.468 --> 28:42.637
Calm down,
you exerting all your damn energy.

28:42.721 --> 28:45.640
[announcer 1] <i>Boy, I'll tell you what,</i>
<i>Ollie is just a force in the middle</i>

28:45.724 --> 28:47.517
<i>and boy, they can cause trouble.</i>

28:47.600 --> 28:50.478
[announcer 1] <i>Spotted the football</i>
<i>on the 39-yard line of the Rangers.</i>

28:50.562 --> 28:53.815
<i>Roberts, plenty of time to pass</i>

28:53.898 --> 28:55.191

28:55.275 --> 28:57.110
[announcer 1] <i>Bounces to the outside,</i>

<i>Fifteen, ten, five, touchdown, EMCC!</i>

29:03.950 --> 29:05.660
Hold up!

29:07.036 --> 29:10.165
[announcer 1] <i>And that's what happens</i>
<i>when you have a quarterback that has...</i>

29:10.248 --> 29:13.418
<i>had as many carries</i>
<i>as Wyatt Roberts has in this game.</i>

29:13.501 --> 29:15.920
<i>He's done it on scrambles,</i>
<i>he's done it on designed runs.</i>

29:16.421 --> 29:18.131
<i>Snap by Minshew, inside hand-off,</i>

29:18.214 --> 29:20.341
<i>fumbles the football</i>
<i>around the 16-yard line</i>

29:20.425 --> 29:22.469
<i>and EMCC says they have it</i>
<i>and they do.</i>

29:23.428 --> 29:26.389
<i>EMCC has a first down,</i>
<i>3:00 to go from the 16-yard line.</i>

29:26.473 --> 29:28.141
Attaboy, Ollie!

[announcer 1 chuckling]
<i>It is Ronald Ollie.</i>

29:35.398 --> 29:38.902
<i>He has had a whale of a third quarter.</i>
<i>An interception and a fumble recovery.</i>

29:38.985 --> 29:40.361
[announcer 2] <i>Boy, Ronald Ollie</i>

29:40.445 --> 29:44.574

<i>dominant defensive performer.</i>

29:44.657 --> 29:45.742
I'm so proud of you.

29:46.659 --> 29:48.953
But just... just every game.

29:49.037 --> 29:51.998
And you'll dominate every game,
as long as you play this game.

29:52.081 --> 29:54.167
You got me?
Just play like that all the time,

29:54.250 --> 29:55.752
not just in the big game.

29:55.835 --> 29:59.172
Just make that habit
and you'll name wherever you wanna go.

29:59.255 --> 30:00.340
-All right. Got you.
-You got me?

30:00.423 --> 30:02.425
-Appreciate it.

32:48.675 --> 32:52.303
[Pellegrin] <i>Northwest is a good team,</i>

32:52.387 --> 32:53.596

32:53.680 --> 32:55.598
<i>And so we jumped from eight to three,</i>

32:55.682 --> 32:59.102
<i>after defeating the number four team</i>
<i>in the country, uh, convincingly.</i>

32:59.227 --> 33:01.646
Everything just started falling
East Mississippi's way

33:01.729 --> 33:03.606
to climb right back to the top.

33:03.690 --> 33:04.983
<i>You're looking at a team that's third,</i>

33:05.066 --> 33:08.277
<i>trying to get into the top two to play</i>
<i>for a National Championship.</i>

33:08.361 --> 33:11.781
<i>Finish your season off beating everybody</i>
<i>in the state playoffs</i>

33:11.864 --> 33:13.616
{\an8}and winning the state championship,

33:13.700 --> 33:15.702
{\an8}you're feeling optimistic that
one of those top two teams

33:15.785 --> 33:18.997
{\an8}are gonna lose in theirs and
you're gonna get right back to one or two.

33:19.998 --> 33:23.543
Always great to have, uh,
an ice cream sandwich. You want one?

33:26.587 --> 33:29.215
[Marcel] <i>I got an offer letter yesterday.</i>
<i>Two of them.</i>

33:29.298 --> 33:32.218
I have a lot of offers,
small schools, like, FCS--

33:32.301 --> 33:34.846
Why would you not, at this point,
entertain all offers?

33:35.596 --> 33:38.057
{\an8}'Cause they would try to force
their will on you.

33:38.141 --> 33:40.226
{\an8}Like, "Come to our school," like,

33:40.309 --> 33:41.769
"You have no other choice
but to come to our school."

33:41.853 --> 33:43.896
-[Kevin West] What's up, big guy?
-Hello, Coach. How you been?

33:43.980 --> 33:46.024
-Good, man. How are you, man?
-I'm good. Real good.

33:46.107 --> 33:47.817
All right, this is the deal.
I've talked to you before.

33:47.900 --> 33:49.193
-Yeah.
-We like you a bunch.

33:49.277 --> 33:50.486
Uh, I think you can play for us.

33:50.570 --> 33:53.364
Biggest thing is this, you've got
some work you gotta do academically.

33:53.448 --> 33:55.825
{\an8}'Cause end of the day,
it's an institution of academics,

33:55.908 --> 33:57.368
{\an8}and end of the day,
you gotta get that done

33:57.452 --> 33:58.661
{\an8}before you can even get on the field.

33:58.745 --> 34:00.663
-[Marcel] Right.
-We're gonna get you a great education,

34:00.747 --> 34:02.623
you know, so at the end of the day, uh,

34:02.707 --> 34:05.001
there should be no doubt that
Southeastern Louisiana loves you.

34:05.084 --> 34:06.794
Oh, yeah, no doubt.
I know that for a fact.

34:06.878 --> 34:08.504
[Kevin] I've given you a date to come.

34:08.588 --> 34:09.922
You couldn't take the date to come.

34:10.005 --> 34:11.924
What else can I do but get you a date,

34:12.007 --> 34:15.344
like I've already done
and you still haven't come.

34:15.428 --> 34:17.889
So, we've shown you we wanted you.

34:17.972 --> 34:21.391
So what do we gotta do to be
the first ones in your life? What--

34:21.476 --> 34:24.853
I say... I want my number.

34:24.978 --> 34:26.063
[Kevin] You want your number?

34:26.147 --> 34:27.607
[Marcel] Number was the biggest thing.

34:27.690 --> 34:29.275
Having a number,
well, that's not a hard thing.

34:29.358 --> 34:31.110
-If you earn it, that ain't a hard thing.
-Yeah.

34:31.194 --> 34:32.862
[Kevin] All right, you know,
what else, what else?

34:32.945 --> 34:34.614
Is that it? Just your number?

34:34.697 --> 34:35.907
-We got cameras.
-[clears throat] What's that?

34:35.989 --> 34:37.033
We got cameras.

34:37.116 --> 34:38.534
-[Kevin] I got you.
-[both chuckle]

34:38.618 --> 34:41.411
Well, uh, if it's against the NCAA rules,
we're not going to do it,

34:41.496 --> 34:42.746
-I can tell you that right now.
-Right now, yeah.

34:42.830 --> 34:44.623
I can tell you that,
that ain't gonna happen.

34:44.706 --> 34:47.877
Whether it's cameras or not, I mean,
if it's against anything the NCAA says

34:47.960 --> 34:50.588
we're not supposed to do,
I don't care if cameras are here or not,

34:50.670 --> 34:51.714
we're not gonna do it.

34:51.797 --> 34:53.800
We're gonna follow the NCAA rules
at Southeastern Louisiana.

34:53.882 --> 34:55.510
-[Marcel] Yes, sir.
-I can promise you that.

35:07.271 --> 35:10.650
...and Davis. [sighs]

35:10.733 --> 35:13.111
That's been, like, three days.

35:23.496 --> 35:24.622

Wyatt is... is a tremendous leader.

35:28.709 --> 35:30.628
-So you're playing guard right now?
-Yes, sir. I'm guard.

35:30.711 --> 35:31.712
Okay. You playing center?

35:31.796 --> 35:36.134
Practice, he'll show up, game film,
he'll show up. It's just attitude. Um...

35:36.217 --> 35:37.260
Gotcha.

35:37.343 --> 35:39.846
Yeah, I just wanted to put
a face with some names though.

35:39.929 --> 35:42.223
All right, so you know,
gotta give y'all a shout,

35:42.306 --> 35:44.183

I'm 6'1". All right. 6'2"? Yeah?

35:47.603 --> 35:48.688

35:50.064 --> 35:51.190
[Williams] He's 6'2".

35:51.274 --> 35:53.109
You see right there with his hands,
see how he's not moving--

35:53.192 --> 35:55.361
Yeah, but he can move his feet though.

35:55.444 --> 35:57.446
He goes to class, you gotta
drag his butt to class?

35:57.530 --> 35:58.614
Mmm-hmm. No, he goes to class.

35:58.698 --> 36:01.033
Six one and a half and 295.

36:01.117 --> 36:02.910
Two ninety-five.
Both of y'all 295?

36:02.994 --> 36:04.912
He's not very strong.
All right, I'll be honest with you,

36:04.996 --> 36:06.914
he's not very strong in his upper body.

36:06.998 --> 36:08.416
-What up, Coach?
-What's up, baby?

36:08.499 --> 36:09.667
-How you doin'?
-I'm doin' well. How are you?

36:09.750 --> 36:10.960
-You know how we feel about you.
-Yes.

36:11.043 --> 36:13.921
And, uh, we really are excited about you
and the possibilities, you know.

36:14.005 --> 36:15.548
-Yes, sir.
-We hope it work out.

36:15.631 --> 36:19.510
DJ Law, is he gonna
actually make it? A 2,5.

36:19.594 --> 36:22.597
[Wagner] It'll come down
to that last grade being put in.

36:22.680 --> 36:24.599
You know, he has some family issues and--

36:24.682 --> 36:26.684
-Like what?
-Uh, just with his son.

36:26.767 --> 36:29.061
You know, baby mama
just gettin' in his head kinda deal.

36:29.145 --> 36:30.438

36:43.284 --> 36:44.285
[Wyatt] It's nothin'.

36:44.368 --> 36:46.662
That's like Ohio even sending me
all this stuff for what?

36:46.746 --> 36:48.414
Killin' trees, man.

36:48.497 --> 36:51.083
Keep sending me this,
I ain't goin' to your school.

36:52.627 --> 36:55.046
I go to school, and get
an education over there. [chuckles]

36:55.129 --> 36:56.422
[indistinct chatter]

37:01.469 --> 37:02.720
[player] North, north, north, north.

37:03.763 --> 37:07.183
[Buddy] Fling it, let's go.
Get it off. Throw it.

37:08.184 --> 37:09.352
Atta baby.

37:09.435 --> 37:10.937

37:12.980 --> 37:14.815
[John] Right away, right away.
South. South.

37:15.733 --> 37:17.902
[Buddy] You ever notice
when J-five gets scared,

37:17.985 --> 37:19.862
he just, like, eases up off the ball?

37:19.946 --> 37:21.364
And the nose goes down.

37:21.447 --> 37:22.865
[Wyatt stuttering]
Yeah, when he doubtin' it?

37:22.949 --> 37:23.991
[Buddy] Yeah.

37:24.951 --> 37:26.702
And when he's confident,
he just unleashes it.

37:27.620 --> 37:30.665
Yeah, but... he's gotta get confident.

37:30.748 --> 37:32.833
[music continues]

37:33.918 --> 37:36.963
With his speed, he can be a quarterback
just about anywhere he wanted to be,

37:37.046 --> 37:38.172
but he just...

37:38.256 --> 37:41.175
Everything with his feet,
everything below his waist is...

37:41.259 --> 37:43.511
You know, you never know when it's--
where it's gonna go.

37:43.594 --> 37:45.680
-Yeah.
-He's gotta get consistent with it.

37:45.763 --> 37:47.682
-Hey, J-five.
-Yes, sir.

37:47.765 --> 37:48.933
[Buddy] I saw the arm action,

37:49.016 --> 37:51.477
you were like a pitcher that was
trying to slow down his release,

37:51.560 --> 37:52.853
and the arm, everything was... [grunts]

37:52.937 --> 37:55.106
and then the arm kinda
slowed down a little bit to...

37:55.189 --> 37:58.234
to guide the ball.
To hell with that, throw that damn thing.

37:58.317 --> 37:59.443
-I got you.
-[Buddy stuttering]

37:59.527 --> 38:00.987
Don't ever second guess that.

38:01.070 --> 38:02.363
-[John] All right.
-Just throw the shit out of it.

38:02.446 --> 38:03.823
-[John] I got you.
-Make them catch it.

38:03.906 --> 38:05.074
[John] Got ya.

38:12.873 --> 38:13.874
[John chuckles]

38:14.792 --> 38:17.086
[Wagner] Hey, J-five.
You didn't even speak when you came in.

38:17.169 --> 38:21.048
What happened to
your niceness and the hugs?

38:26.846 --> 38:28.973
Where's the game at on Thursday?

38:29.056 --> 38:32.601
[Wagner] Delta. It's so far,
we always just whoop their ass.

38:32.685 --> 38:33.769
[Wagner clears throat]

38:33.853 --> 38:35.438
[John] How many hours away?

38:35.521 --> 38:36.647
[Wagner] Four.

38:36.731 --> 38:37.773
[John] What the fuck?

38:37.857 --> 38:39.317
[John sighs]

38:43.529 --> 38:45.531
[Wagner] <i>I mean, he's... he's pissed.</i>

38:45.614 --> 38:49.660
He didn't transfer from Florida State
to here to sit on the bench, so...

38:49.744 --> 38:52.371
<i>I just know that, like,</i>
<i>when a transfer comes in,</i>

38:52.455 --> 38:55.875
<i>especially a quarterback like that,</i>
<i>they expect to start right off the bat,</i>

38:55.958 --> 38:58.252
<i>and play and then go back to that level.</i>

38:58.336 --> 39:01.464
<i>I mean, that's just what we've done.</i>

39:01.547 --> 39:04.258
You know, and John,
it's a little bit different situation

39:04.342 --> 39:06.927
'cause he's not playing
and he doesn't have stats and he...

39:07.011 --> 39:10.014
I mean, and the season's almost over,
so it's like...

39:10.097 --> 39:12.683
[grunts] you know,
you're runnin' out of time.

39:12.767 --> 39:14.101
<i>He should play Thursday.</i>

39:14.226 --> 39:16.520
<i>Hopefully, they will take Wyatt out</i>

39:16.604 --> 39:19.273
<i>and let him play</i>
<i>at least the whole second half</i>

39:19.357 --> 39:22.234
because we're gonna be
annihilating this team.

39:22.318 --> 39:23.402
[John] <i>Hey, 33, 33.</i>

39:23.486 --> 39:26.697
[Wagner] <i>He just wants to be out there</i>
<i>and he said that Auburn was comin'.</i>

39:26.781 --> 39:30.117
<i>I mean, if he doesn't get to play,</i>
<i>I just almost hope that they don't come,</i>

39:30.201 --> 39:32.703
<i>because it will absolutely crush that kid.</i>

39:32.787 --> 39:34.955
<i>That they're on the sidelines</i>
<i>and he's not out there.</i>

39:35.039 --> 39:36.665
[Lesley] Up field, slam it down that way.

39:36.749 --> 39:37.875
[Buddy] There you go.

39:37.958 --> 39:41.212
What? You're not gonna play when
the biggest school come watch us play?

39:41.295 --> 39:42.713
You not gonna play when Auburn come?

39:42.797 --> 39:46.425
[John clicks tongue] Man, I gotta play.
They coming to watch me, so I gotta play.

39:46.509 --> 39:49.345
Ain't no questions asked, I'm playing.

39:50.513 --> 39:51.639
[Buddy] <i>Last ball game of the year.</i>

39:51.722 --> 39:54.350
<i>We're looking to, uh, finish strong.</i>

39:54.433 --> 39:58.729
<i>Go into a playoff game and, uh,</i>
<i>try to work for a National Championship.</i>

39:58.813 --> 40:00.981
Every year we play Mississippi Delta,

40:01.065 --> 40:03.401
there's always some type of, uh,

40:03.484 --> 40:05.861
there's some type of something
that happens.

40:05.945 --> 40:08.614
Hey, your guy hit my guy ten yards
over on the white.

40:08.697 --> 40:09.698
{\an8}[Buddy] I'm sorry.

40:09.782 --> 40:11.575
{\an8}Why, Buddy?
You ran the damn score up

40:11.659 --> 40:13.661
blocking punts and onside--
That's all right.

40:13.744 --> 40:15.246
[indistinct bickering]

40:15.329 --> 40:17.998
[Buddy] Okay, all right, all right.
Hey, no, no, no. I don't wanna hear it.

40:18.082 --> 40:19.500
That's right. Walk off.

40:19.583 --> 40:22.002
Yeah, we told the guys what to expect.

40:22.086 --> 40:24.964
We told them that, you know,
this team has nothing to lose.

40:25.047 --> 40:26.465
<i>People are gonna talk smack.</i>

40:26.549 --> 40:29.051
<i>People are gonna say things,</i>
<i>they may even do things</i>

40:29.135 --> 40:30.928
<i>to try to get you outta your game.</i>

40:31.011 --> 40:32.721
[Wood] When I score,
I can't talk a lot of trash.

40:32.805 --> 40:34.140
When I make a big play, a big conversion,

40:34.223 --> 40:36.892
I can't take it away from us
with doing something stupid.

40:36.976 --> 40:38.018
Like, you'll watch this first play

40:38.102 --> 40:39.645
and they're gonna
cheap shot him across the field,

40:39.728 --> 40:42.022
you see his mouthpiece get knocked out
and everything like that.

40:42.106 --> 40:44.817
You turn and say something to the guy
and the referee is all over you.

40:44.900 --> 40:48.195
We're... we're marked now and
believe me we're gonna be marked,

40:48.279 --> 40:49.822
and with the stuff that's going on

40:49.905 --> 40:51.574
and Coach Stephens' deal
and all that kind of stuff,

40:51.657 --> 40:55.911
they're looking to try to get stuff so
we gotta be ultra-clean in how we play it.

40:55.995 --> 40:57.788
I don't mean not be nasty.

40:57.872 --> 41:00.875
I don't-- I'm not saying that,
you gotta play the game in a nasty manner,

41:00.958 --> 41:02.543
but I gotta be smart about what I do.

41:02.626 --> 41:05.045
You better come with an attitude
and get ready to play, all right?

41:05.129 --> 41:06.338
Every single play you watch,

41:06.422 --> 41:08.549
they're chipping these guys
at the very end of the play.

41:08.632 --> 41:11.218
The play might be over and they're
still nudging 'em just to bully 'em.

41:11.302 --> 41:13.137
All right?
'Cause that's the way they play.

41:13.220 --> 41:14.930
They wanna come out here
and beat the shit out of you.

41:15.014 --> 41:18.934
What are you gonna do about it?
You're just gonna roll over? Come on, man.

41:21.145 --> 41:24.732
[Buddy] <i>Don't let the little things</i>
<i>get to you, okay?</i>

41:24.815 --> 41:27.318
<i>Is what's goin' on sometimes</i>
<i>on a field fair?</i>

41:27.401 --> 41:29.361
Hell no. There ain't fair.
Life ain't fair.

41:29.445 --> 41:31.947
Football ain't fair, it ain't fair
that you got all this talent

41:32.031 --> 41:33.491
and beating the hell outta people,
that ain't fair.

41:33.574 --> 41:35.367
It ain't fair that some of you are here

41:35.451 --> 41:37.620
and not at the big-time...
at a big-time school.

41:37.703 --> 41:40.706
Some of you will be, it's not fair that
some of you won't get that chance.

41:40.789 --> 41:44.126
It's not fair that somebody has an injury
or somebody doesn't have a chance

41:44.210 --> 41:46.170
to play in every game.
That's not fair.

41:46.253 --> 41:47.296
Ain't no fair.

41:47.379 --> 41:49.757
There's just us going out there
and beating the hell out of people.

41:49.840 --> 41:51.342
That's it. That's it.

41:51.425 --> 41:54.261
Don't worry about what happens.
Don't worry about the little words.

41:54.345 --> 41:56.514
Just stay focused.

42:04.813 --> 42:07.733
It's game day, it's game day,
it's game day!

42:31.465 --> 42:33.050
[indistinct chatter]

42:38.973 --> 42:40.432
{\an8}[player 1] It's on now.
[player 2] That's right, man.

42:40.516 --> 42:41.559
{\an8}[player 3] It been on.

42:41.642 --> 42:42.685
{\an8}-Fuck all that dumb shit.
-[player 4] Mmm-hmm.

42:42.810 --> 42:44.186
Y'all hit my man in the face.

42:44.270 --> 42:46.397
It gonna cost one of y'all,
now I'm telling you, now.

42:46.480 --> 42:48.023
That's not sportsmanship, bro.

42:48.107 --> 42:49.149
-Come on.
-I got him, I got him.

42:49.233 --> 42:50.776
Turn around, turn around
and look the other way for me.

42:50.859 --> 42:53.696
[Buddy stutters] <i>One of their wide</i>
<i>receivers punched one of our managers.</i>

42:53.779 --> 42:54.780
<i>And laid him open.</i>
<i>He's in there now.</i>

42:54.863 --> 42:56.532
-[referee] Just now?
-He's in there now.

42:56.615 --> 42:57.908
-Out there?
-Oh, yeah. Five stitches.

42:57.992 --> 42:59.952
[trainer] All right, this is going to go
over your head, okay?

43:00.035 --> 43:01.829
{\an8}[Buddy] <i>He went over and picked up a ball.</i>

43:01.912 --> 43:05.416
{\an8}<i>One guy hit him. He pushed him back.</i>
<i>And two jumped on him.</i>

43:05.499 --> 43:07.835
<i>After that... punched him in the eye.</i>

43:07.918 --> 43:10.129
<i>He's gonna need about</i>
<i>five or six stitches on it.</i>

43:11.213 --> 43:13.090
[Wood] <i>That's absolutely</i>
<i>the craziest thing I've ever seen.</i>

43:13.173 --> 43:14.883
Wow. Hit him.
Non-padded kid.

43:14.967 --> 43:17.636
We've already talked to our guys
about trying to play between the rules.

43:17.720 --> 43:18.721
It's gonna be a spirited deal, now.

43:18.804 --> 43:21.056
[stuttering] I can't believe that.

43:21.140 --> 43:22.433
[Buddy] Don't worry
about what they're saying.

43:22.516 --> 43:23.684
Don't worry about what they're doing.

43:23.767 --> 43:26.478
If some extra-curricular activity happens,
back off,

43:26.562 --> 43:30.816
'cause I promise you, we're gonna score
as absolute much as we can score tonight.

43:30.899 --> 43:31.900
[grunting]

43:31.984 --> 43:34.445
[player] They just trying to get us
out of our mind.

43:34.528 --> 43:37.156
[DJ] They really just fixin' to make us
go harder than we ever went.

43:38.157 --> 43:39.867
[Trickett] No, don't do anything stupid
that'll get you...

43:39.950 --> 43:41.619
-I'mma try not to, God damn it.
-...out of next game, man.

43:41.702 --> 43:42.870
[CJ] <i>I was here by myself, bro.</i>

43:42.953 --> 43:44.455
They ain't do shit.
They ain't say a thing.

43:44.538 --> 43:47.333
[player] Man, stop peeking over here, man.
We know y'all scared, man.

43:47.416 --> 43:48.417
None of that, none of that.

43:48.500 --> 43:50.294
-[whistle blows]
-[Buddy] Hey, shut up. Shut up.

43:50.377 --> 43:52.338
Hey, shut up!

43:52.421 --> 43:56.675
Do all our talkin' in about...
about 45. Don't worry about it.

43:56.759 --> 43:59.553
[Trickett] Man, y'all better be the most
savage motherfuckers out here tonight.

43:59.637 --> 44:01.096
-If I was on, I'd kill someone.
-[whistle blows]

44:01.180 --> 44:03.265
[chuckling]
Ooh, I wish I was fucking playing.

44:03.349 --> 44:05.267
I'd be talking so much shit.

44:05.351 --> 44:06.310
[Buddy] Just keep it--

44:06.393 --> 44:07.645
I just don't want anybody
thrown out, either side.

44:07.728 --> 44:08.854
I just want to keep it calmed down.

44:08.979 --> 44:10.189
And if one of mine needs to come over here

44:10.272 --> 44:11.732
and sit for the rest of the game,
let me know.

44:11.815 --> 44:13.942
-Yes.
-I mean, I don't need no instigators.

44:14.026 --> 44:15.152
I need smart people.

44:15.235 --> 44:17.363
[players chanting]

44:27.706 --> 44:28.874
Let's go!

44:28.957 --> 44:29.958
[Buddy] That's it.

44:30.042 --> 44:32.336
[Wood] Do what you do now.
Have fun, get after them suckers.

44:32.419 --> 44:33.629
They want a street fight,
we'll get it, let's go.

44:33.712 --> 44:35.381
Dear God, thank you for these guys,
the way they've worked.

44:35.464 --> 44:36.632
Thank you for all of our blessings.

44:36.715 --> 44:38.342
Help us to play this game
in a violent and vicious manner

44:38.425 --> 44:39.635
and play it the way
it's supposed to be played.

44:39.718 --> 44:41.929
[player] Family on me, family on three!
One, two, three!

44:42.012 --> 44:43.514
[players] Family!

44:43.597 --> 44:47.101
[Lesley] <i>Guys,</i>
<i>this is what they did to one of ours.</i>

44:47.184 --> 44:49.269
That's all I'm saying.
If that don't piss you off,

44:49.353 --> 44:51.105
then you ain't got a goddamn heart.

44:51.188 --> 44:53.440
You goddamn sure
ain't got love for one another.

44:53.524 --> 44:56.068
In between the whistles
that are blown tonight,

44:56.151 --> 44:59.321
you fuck somebody up. For me.

45:00.114 --> 45:05.285
Understand, guys, please.
You cannot throw a punch.

45:05.369 --> 45:10.582
But in between every whistle
that you are on that football field,

45:10.666 --> 45:13.377
you fuck somebody up.

45:13.460 --> 45:14.711
<i>You goddamn understand me?</i>

45:14.795 --> 45:17.464
[players] <i>Yes, sir!</i>
[Lesley] <i>Every fucking play!</i>

45:17.548 --> 45:20.217
[clicks tongue] They already know
they was gonna lose but now they finna'...

45:20.300 --> 45:21.635
Man, I'm hitting everything movin'.

45:21.718 --> 45:23.053
-Man, look at Coach Lashlee.
-Linemen, centers...

45:23.137 --> 45:24.263
Everything. I'm hitting everything.

45:24.346 --> 45:26.306
-[stutters] And there go Coach Lashlee.
-Huh?

45:26.390 --> 45:28.016
Coach Lashlee.
Right behind us, cus.

45:28.100 --> 45:29.101
Who?

45:29.184 --> 45:30.352
Coach Lashlee from Auburn.

45:30.436 --> 45:32.396
{\an8}-You should beat them.
-Hmm.

45:32.479 --> 45:34.022
{\an8}And then it'll be Gulf Coast or who?

45:34.106 --> 45:35.232
{\an8}Or Northwest.

45:35.691 --> 45:37.526
And we've already beaten Northwest once.

45:37.609 --> 45:39.027
Hey, we about to tee-off on them, bro.

45:39.111 --> 45:41.321
I'mma tag off on somebody.
I'mma cut a nigga or something.

45:41.405 --> 45:42.573
[Buddy] <i>I don't care who you are.</i>

45:42.656 --> 45:45.617
You don't put yourself
in a position to hurt this team,

45:45.701 --> 45:48.120
by getting kicked out
or having a personal foul.

45:48.203 --> 45:50.831
You take...
Hey, you just whip their ass!

45:50.914 --> 45:53.041
That's it. You understand?

45:53.125 --> 45:55.961
You give them a stone-cold ass-whippin'!

45:56.879 --> 45:59.006
Now get your asses in here
and everybody touch somebody.

46:00.007 --> 46:03.594
Hey, guys. Great season.
Let's finish it up hard. You got me?

46:03.677 --> 46:06.680
Finish it up hard.
Hurt 'em, hard.

46:06.763 --> 46:07.848
-Our Father...
-[all] Who art in Heaven,

46:07.931 --> 46:08.932
hallowed be thy name...

[announcer 1] <i>Roberts awaiting</i>
