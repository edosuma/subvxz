WEBVTT

03:18.203 --> 03:20.973
- Olly olly oxen free!

03:21.009 --> 03:22.667
One, two, three, home!
I won!

03:22.702 --> 03:24.373
- I saw you, Henry James.

03:24.408 --> 03:26.539
- No, you didn't!
- Yes, I did!

03:26.574 --> 03:28.779
- No, I...
- Yes, I did!

03:59.208 --> 04:01.506
Danny. Gun.

04:07.318 --> 04:08.687
- You can't catch me!

04:36.377 --> 04:37.615
Shoot him.

05:14.556 --> 05:16.888
-- Get away from the wood.
- Go wash up for lunch.

05:18.751 --> 05:20.922
- Wait for me, boys!

05:26.993 --> 05:29.502
- That roast beef
smells good, Ma.

05:31.671 --> 05:34.606
That bullock sure picked
the wrong yard to walk into.

05:40.176 --> 05:41.778
Inside.

06:29.522 --> 06:31.630
Whoa!

06:50.444 --> 06:52.552
Hello?

07:04.264 --> 07:05.966
I'm Sergeant Nate Clintoff.

07:06.001 --> 07:09.734
This is my wife, Louisa.

07:11.039 --> 07:12.303
We're headed to Everton.

07:12.338 --> 07:13.867
You're a little off the track.

07:13.902 --> 07:16.167
Couldn't help
but smell your roast.

07:16.203 --> 07:18.710
- Excuse
my husband's manner's, Mrs...

07:19.509 --> 07:22.275
Johnson. Mrs Joe Johnson.

07:22.310 --> 07:24.951
- We've been travelling
for some time, Mrs Johnson.

07:24.986 --> 07:27.185
Up from Melbourne.

07:27.221 --> 07:28.717
Out from London, actually.

07:28.753 --> 07:32.592
It's been a long nine
and a half weeks.

07:32.627 --> 07:36.788
Crossing the river further south
we had some trouble.

07:36.823 --> 07:38.321
Lost all our provisions.

07:38.356 --> 07:41.658
- And, well, the smell
of your cooking.

07:41.694 --> 07:43.295
The aroma.

07:44.865 --> 07:46.898
We feel terrible in asking.

07:46.934 --> 07:48.842
We can see you don't have much.

07:48.877 --> 07:50.409
We make do.

07:50.444 --> 07:52.909
Nate Clintoff,
you are not helping.

07:58.285 --> 08:00.210
-- Um...

08:00.245 --> 08:01.615
-- If we might...

08:01.650 --> 08:03.046
..join you for your meal.

08:03.081 --> 08:05.924
We'd share a plate between us.

08:05.959 --> 08:08.788
We won't intrude at your table.
We'd be forever indebted to you.

08:08.823 --> 08:11.395
- Horse dead in the yard.

08:11.430 --> 08:13.831
Not long butchered a bullock.

08:15.070 --> 08:16.695
Eugh!

08:16.730 --> 08:18.866
It's a war injury.

08:18.901 --> 08:22.369
It plays up every now and again.

08:28.911 --> 08:31.083
Did your Da do that to you,
Mister?

08:31.119 --> 08:32.583
Mind your business.

08:32.618 --> 08:37.387
Er, no, no.
In Her Majesty's service.

08:37.422 --> 08:39.291
- Master...
- Danny.

08:39.326 --> 08:41.052
- Transvaal Rebellion.

08:41.088 --> 08:42.930
Fighting the Boers
in South Africa.

08:42.965 --> 08:44.089
Louisa, please.

08:44.124 --> 08:45.463
- Twelve years
behind a desk

08:45.499 --> 08:47.125
was enough
for Sergeant Clintoff.

08:47.160 --> 08:48.498
I thought we could do with
a change,

08:48.534 --> 08:50.035
a challenge and some fresh air.

08:50.071 --> 08:52.630
So, here we are.

08:52.666 --> 08:53.965
Australia!

08:54.000 --> 08:55.537
To police a town in the bush.

08:55.572 --> 08:56.906
- I'm goin' out...

08:56.941 --> 08:58.571
I've always lived in a big city
called London.

08:58.607 --> 09:00.374
- Me too!

09:00.409 --> 09:02.072
London?

09:02.107 --> 09:04.748
- Oh my gosh, how blessed!

09:04.784 --> 09:07.721
Yes, London. It's the capital
city of England.

09:07.756 --> 09:10.986
- And you're gonna be the
boss of the Everton outpost?

09:11.022 --> 09:14.284
Well, Everton's becoming a town

09:14.320 --> 09:16.957
and I'm here to uphold
Her Majesty's law

09:16.992 --> 09:19.924
and administer
the new legislations.

09:19.960 --> 09:22.130
Just in time for the Sale.

09:22.728 --> 09:23.793
Yes.

09:25.132 --> 09:27.032
They wanted us here
a little earlier

09:27.068 --> 09:29.409
to settle in before
the big day

09:29.444 --> 09:32.910
but we got caught
crossing the river.

09:33.511 --> 09:36.175
Deeper than I thought.

09:36.210 --> 09:38.584
Sheep be down from
the high country soon.

09:38.619 --> 09:41.287
That's where my husband is.
He's a drover.

09:41.322 --> 09:43.690
He's been away three months.

09:45.253 --> 09:46.885
Nate and I have hardly left
each other's sides

09:46.920 --> 09:48.428
since we were married.

09:48.463 --> 09:51.229
Can't imagine
what it must be like.

09:51.264 --> 09:52.598
Must be wonderful

09:52.634 --> 09:54.833
when he finally does come home
to the family.

09:58.005 --> 10:02.071
I love watching my Joe cantering
across the flats, coming home.

10:02.107 --> 10:05.171
Sun setting behind him,
children running to greet him.

10:05.206 --> 10:07.912
Waving his hat with joy
on seeing them.

10:15.621 --> 10:17.883
- To Everton, you say?
- Yes.

10:17.918 --> 10:20.793
Sergeant, Mrs Clintoff,

10:21.658 --> 10:24.289
I have a favour to ask.

10:24.324 --> 10:27.267
- It's too heavy for you.

10:27.302 --> 10:28.460
- I'm alright.
- Good boy.

10:29.669 --> 10:31.271
It's very nice
of the McGuinnesses

10:31.306 --> 10:32.771
to take the children for you.

10:32.807 --> 10:35.203
Since Joe Junior's birth.
Novelty for the children.

10:35.239 --> 10:38.311
Miss Shirley enjoys it,
having no children of her own.

10:38.347 --> 10:40.507
Gives me time to prepare. Rest.

10:40.542 --> 10:42.043
Rest?

10:42.079 --> 10:45.551
I hope to start my own business.
I'm a writer.

10:45.586 --> 10:48.413
Thinking a monthly
journal for women.

10:48.449 --> 10:50.420
And I'm just so looking forward
to the challenges

10:50.456 --> 10:51.957
of life on the land.

10:51.992 --> 10:54.160
I wish you all the very best
with that then, Mrs Clintoff.

10:54.195 --> 10:55.762
Louisa, please.

10:56.595 --> 10:58.158
Thank you again, Mrs Johnson.

10:58.193 --> 10:59.930
It was so lovely to meet you
and your...

10:59.965 --> 11:01.524
- ..beautiful children.

11:01.560 --> 11:03.198
-- I'm gonna win!
-- No, you won't!

11:06.134 --> 11:08.407
- There they are.
Up you hop.

11:08.442 --> 11:09.975
- Help me in please, Mister.

11:10.010 --> 11:12.036
- Good luck with your
birth. Looks like any day now.

11:12.072 --> 11:13.571
- I want to sit there.

11:13.607 --> 11:15.738
The baby's delivery should be
straightforward enough.

11:15.774 --> 11:18.574
If you're ever in town,
perhaps we could get together.

11:18.610 --> 11:20.215
Not much of a town there yet,
Mrs Clintoff.

11:20.250 --> 11:23.286
Still a fair distance.
My Joe brings the supplies home.

11:23.322 --> 11:24.648
Oh, I see.

11:25.689 --> 11:27.420
Excuse me.

11:30.158 --> 11:32.227
- Thank you,
Sergeant Clintoff.

11:33.532 --> 11:34.700
You should get going

11:34.735 --> 11:36.528
if you wish to make Everton
by nightfall.

11:38.237 --> 11:39.630
We do.

11:39.665 --> 11:41.333
- Well, let's make haste
to the McGuinnesses.

11:41.368 --> 11:44.343
They hold the keys
to our humble new abode.

11:44.378 --> 11:45.743
I can show you the way.

11:45.778 --> 11:47.639
Oh, why, thank you,
Master Danny.

11:47.674 --> 11:49.847
We are very grateful to have
you as our travel companion.

11:49.882 --> 11:51.547
Joe Junior, you shouldn't
have done that!

11:51.582 --> 11:53.276
I want my doll.

11:53.311 --> 11:55.086
- Oh, please, let me.

11:55.121 --> 11:58.952
Thank you again, Mrs Johnson.
We're truly indebted to you.

11:58.987 --> 12:02.222
Now, who does this belong to?

12:02.257 --> 12:05.632
-- I want my dolly.
- Oh. There you are.

12:05.667 --> 12:07.763
Play nicely. We have
a long ride ahead of us.

12:07.799 --> 12:09.469
Get a good trade with the meat.

12:09.504 --> 12:10.966
Donkey or horse,
either will do.

12:11.001 --> 12:15.069
- Yes, Ma.
- Flour. Rice. Sugar, tea.

12:15.104 --> 12:17.808
- And bullets. We're low.
- Yes, Ma.

12:17.843 --> 12:19.075
And get some of
Miss Shirley's cakes

12:19.110 --> 12:21.044
and sweets into your skinny
malinky long legs.

12:21.080 --> 12:22.939
And then straight home, son.
I'll need your help.

12:22.974 --> 12:24.576
Yes, Ma.

12:31.655 --> 12:32.925
Always with you.

12:39.327 --> 12:41.626
-- You right?
-- Thank you.

12:43.162 --> 12:44.362
- No fightin'.

12:44.397 --> 12:46.163
You hear me?
Joe Junior, Henry James.

12:46.198 --> 12:48.231
- Yes, Ma.
- Yes, Ma.

12:48.266 --> 12:49.342
Look after ya sister.

12:49.377 --> 12:50.572
- Yes, Ma.
- Yes, Ma.

12:50.607 --> 12:51.903
I love yous.

12:51.938 --> 12:53.239
I love you.

12:53.274 --> 12:54.480
- Be good
for the McGuinnesses.

12:54.515 --> 12:56.074
Good luck with the baby, Ma.

12:56.109 --> 12:58.911
You hear me? I love yous.

12:58.946 --> 13:01.454
Love you! Bye, Ma!

13:01.489 --> 13:02.685
- Love you.
- Love you.

13:02.721 --> 13:04.050
- Yah!

13:04.086 --> 13:05.923
- Thank you, Mrs Clintoff.

13:05.958 --> 13:08.318
- Take care, Mrs Johnson.
-- Will do.

13:08.354 --> 13:10.396
- Good luck, Ma.
-- Bye!

13:10.431 --> 13:11.559
- Love you!
- Bye!

13:11.594 --> 13:12.862
Bye Ma!

13:12.898 --> 13:15.325
- See you tomorrow!
- Love you!

13:15.361 --> 13:17.164
- I'll eat some cake
for you.

14:12.491 --> 14:15.095
Yeah, go on.

14:15.130 --> 14:16.493
Go on.

14:18.628 --> 14:20.197
Go on.

14:26.331 --> 14:28.370
She's lucky we found her.

14:29.204 --> 14:30.871
Hasn't lost too much condition.

14:30.907 --> 14:32.145
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

14:33.711 --> 14:35.676
Head up. Go on!

14:35.711 --> 14:37.340
Come on.

14:37.375 --> 14:38.779
Get up. Steady on, girl.

14:41.949 --> 14:43.113
Get around.

14:44.159 --> 14:45.519
Go on.

14:47.525 --> 14:48.987
Hey!

15:14.079 --> 15:15.583
Ooh.

15:15.619 --> 15:16.649
Oh!

15:28.995 --> 15:30.795
Ooh.

16:23.250 --> 16:24.986
Please, my children!

16:54.149 --> 16:57.255
Oh, good God. A foot.

18:17.966 --> 18:22.141
- Mr Edwards, we will do all
we can to bring those to justice

18:22.177 --> 18:24.909
for the brutal murders
of your wife and children.

18:24.944 --> 18:26.871
We hope you don't leave us.

18:26.907 --> 18:30.409
Certainly, Father,
but I have other priorities now.

18:30.444 --> 18:32.182
Is this correct, Mr Edwards?

18:32.217 --> 18:35.155
No, the Black's nose
was more refined.

18:37.286 --> 18:39.117
Get this body onto the wagon.

18:39.152 --> 18:40.287
Thinner.

18:40.322 --> 18:43.163
And his brow was a heavier brow.

18:51.331 --> 18:52.733
Trooper Leslie.

18:55.437 --> 18:59.179
Mrs Joe Johnson, further south.

19:00.407 --> 19:02.105
I'm worried about her.

19:02.140 --> 19:06.678
She's alone, vulnerable
and in a delicate condition.

19:06.714 --> 19:08.779
Nothing delicate
about our mountain women.

19:08.814 --> 19:11.121
I beg your pardon,
Father McGuinness?

19:11.156 --> 19:13.384
Molly Johnson grew up
out here.

19:13.420 --> 19:15.220
She knows the ways.

19:15.256 --> 19:17.396
Crack shot, too.

19:17.432 --> 19:21.498
Trust me, your attention needs
to be on finding the murderer.

19:23.470 --> 19:26.597
I wish not for any other woman
or child be harmed, Father.

19:26.632 --> 19:28.373
It's my duty to see to that.

19:31.277 --> 19:33.072
Quickest way to the Johnson's
from here.

19:33.107 --> 19:34.214
Um...

19:35.750 --> 19:37.181
Over that hill there,

19:37.216 --> 19:39.247
and down the range
on the other side

19:39.282 --> 19:41.450
which I would not recommend.

19:41.486 --> 19:43.922
A local mountain man
wouldn't attempt it, Sir.

19:43.958 --> 19:46.485
I'd take the main thoroughfare.

19:46.521 --> 19:48.987
Come on!

21:01.396 --> 21:03.699
You up for a good night?

21:06.464 --> 21:07.703
Oh, good.

21:08.733 --> 21:10.772
Ah, not so bad. And you?

21:11.340 --> 21:13.241
- Fortunes told!

21:13.276 --> 21:16.577
Happy endings guaranteed!

21:16.612 --> 21:18.447
Pick a fighter.
Give us your name.

21:18.482 --> 21:20.577
Fair fights.
The winner takes all.

21:20.612 --> 21:22.553
Roll up! Roll up!

21:24.149 --> 21:28.590
Roll up, roll up!
Roll up, roll up! Have a bet!

21:39.138 --> 21:41.000
"Bodies, one Trooper Phillips,

21:41.035 --> 21:44.170
"one native policeman
Dempsey Buckskin, found dead.

21:44.205 --> 21:45.339
"Stop.

21:45.374 --> 21:47.304
"Three weeks back. Stop.

21:47.339 --> 21:51.207
"North of Victorian border.
Stop. Moving native prisoner.

21:51.242 --> 21:56.015
"Black tracker notes
the prisoner killed them."

21:56.051 --> 21:59.359
That's six people dead,
including the Edwards family.

22:01.154 --> 22:03.460
What would make him
come back up into the mountains?

22:03.495 --> 22:06.928
Probably a Ngarigo man, Sir.
Or Walgalu.

22:06.964 --> 22:09.633
- Tribes local to the area.
- Thank you, I've been briefed.

22:11.830 --> 22:14.835
I'd advise a raiding party, Sir.

22:14.870 --> 22:16.974
Mr Jonathan Edwards might not be
a man of the land

22:17.010 --> 22:18.542
like his forebears.

22:18.578 --> 22:20.474
His business is mainly
in Melbourne these days...

22:20.509 --> 22:22.075
I did question the man, Trooper.

22:22.111 --> 22:24.612
But it's our local wool he's
using to build his empire, Sir,

22:24.648 --> 22:26.413
which the locals are
very grateful for.

22:26.448 --> 22:28.013
- Get to your point.

22:28.049 --> 22:31.257
If we don't organise
a raiding party, they will.

22:31.292 --> 22:33.585
And they won't spare the gins
or children.

22:39.534 --> 22:42.766
We will spare the women
and children. That's an order.

22:42.802 --> 22:47.296
Sir. If I may suggest, bring
troopers from Jarren's Outpost.

22:47.331 --> 22:49.406
It's the most southern to
the Victorian border.

22:49.442 --> 22:51.003
- Sweeping the area
as they come.

22:51.038 --> 22:53.510
And can take in the Johnson's
property as well.

22:53.545 --> 22:55.070
But I'm hoping that
the man of the house

22:55.106 --> 22:56.877
gets his supplies
and heads home.

22:56.913 --> 22:59.276
Then our responsibility
to Molly Johnson is over.

23:00.444 --> 23:02.681
Or you could take a little ride
out there yourself.

23:02.716 --> 23:05.583
Not my strong suit, Sir. Riding.

23:05.618 --> 23:07.321
I've been briefed.

23:07.356 --> 23:08.786
Man Oi!

23:08.821 --> 23:10.660
Watch your mouth, ya mongrel!

23:10.696 --> 23:12.524
- There'll be mayhem
before the sun's down.

23:12.560 --> 23:13.994
You'll need me here.

23:15.366 --> 23:17.429
What's the outpost to the north?

23:17.465 --> 23:19.028
Milbaral, Sir.

23:19.064 --> 23:20.997
Send a telegram
to both outposts,

23:21.033 --> 23:22.398
seeing if they can
spare some men

23:22.433 --> 23:24.472
and when they think they might
be able to move out.

23:24.508 --> 23:26.545
Immediately would be preferred.

23:36.047 --> 23:38.920
-- These up?
- Yes, Sir.

23:40.358 --> 23:42.693
- Eugh!

23:46.892 --> 23:49.227
We're even, now get goin'.

23:49.794 --> 23:51.196
Food, Missus.

23:52.331 --> 23:55.508
Been running for days,
carrying this wound. This.

23:57.704 --> 23:59.004
I heard you coming.

23:59.039 --> 24:01.143
Laid down there,
hoping you wouldn't shoot.

24:01.179 --> 24:02.515
You schooled?

24:02.550 --> 24:05.416
Muloga Mission. Father
Matthew's wife and daughter.

24:05.451 --> 24:07.916
Educated Black.
A danger in itself.

24:10.685 --> 24:12.650
Bury your baby girl, Missus.

24:12.685 --> 24:14.087
Least I can do.

24:17.630 --> 24:20.593
I can fell a tree for you.
Stack the wood heap.

24:20.628 --> 24:21.996
Level the ground there.

24:22.031 --> 24:23.936
I reckon you don't want
the snakes getting in under.

24:23.971 --> 24:25.032
And the collar?

24:28.041 --> 24:30.103
My crime, Missus?

24:30.935 --> 24:33.238
Existing whilst Black.

24:38.214 --> 24:40.011
Yadaka.

24:40.046 --> 24:43.116
Of the Guugu Yimithirr
adopted Ngarigo.

24:47.627 --> 24:50.157
One night. Fell a tree,
and you need to be gone.

24:50.193 --> 24:51.660
Two.

24:51.696 --> 24:54.329
Full moon then.
Good to walk by, Missus.

24:54.365 --> 24:55.866
My Joe be home soon.

24:55.901 --> 24:58.695
He's a drover, bringing sheep
down from the high country.

24:58.731 --> 25:00.936
Your children?

25:01.901 --> 25:03.466
What do you know of my children?

25:03.502 --> 25:05.477
I noticed the little stretcher
beds by the wall, Missus.

25:05.512 --> 25:08.545
- They're none of your business.
- Yes, boss.

25:08.581 --> 25:10.380
He's the boss.
I'm just a drover's wife.

25:10.415 --> 25:11.876
But cross me and I'll kill ya.

25:11.912 --> 25:13.384
I'll shoot you where you stand,

25:13.420 --> 25:15.184
and I'll bury you
where you fall.

25:15.219 --> 25:17.220
Yes, Missus.

25:17.255 --> 25:19.317
Thank you, Missus.

25:21.688 --> 25:23.662
Bury that deep.

26:24.287 --> 26:26.417
Missus?

27:03.825 --> 27:06.493
So you are always with her.

27:06.529 --> 27:08.899
A gin showed me.

27:10.328 --> 27:14.531
She helped me bury my firstborn,
Jack.

27:16.167 --> 27:18.876
She helped me bury my Da, too.

27:21.413 --> 27:23.749
Cried a river, she did.

27:25.586 --> 27:28.578
Howled like the wailing
winds in a storm.

27:31.523 --> 27:33.858
It's not like she knew him.

28:47.861 --> 28:50.693
I'll get my hat.

28:59.203 --> 29:00.572
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

29:00.608 --> 29:01.906
Ma!

29:01.942 --> 29:03.611
Danny, it's alright.

29:03.646 --> 29:05.114
- Ma!
- Danny!

29:27.440 --> 29:29.133
- Sergeant Clintoff!

29:29.168 --> 29:32.169
Ah, Henry James. Joe Junior.

29:32.205 --> 29:35.373
Don't you both look, er, smart.

29:35.409 --> 29:38.917
Henry James, Joe Junior,
I told you not to run!

29:39.815 --> 29:41.551
Afternoon, Miss Shirley.

29:41.586 --> 29:43.351
Enjoying the festivities?

29:43.387 --> 29:44.956
No.

29:46.326 --> 29:47.783
Father McGuinness?

29:47.818 --> 29:50.261
My brother is still with
Mr Edwards and the undertaker,

29:50.296 --> 29:51.756
bless them.

29:51.791 --> 29:53.027
Louisa?

29:53.062 --> 29:55.195
- Ah, she's not
feeling her best.

29:55.230 --> 29:58.332
At home. Bed rest
with her notepad and pen.

29:58.833 --> 30:00.365
And miss all this?

30:00.400 --> 30:02.506
I wasn't expecting all this,
to be honest,

30:02.542 --> 30:04.875
but she's really not well.

30:04.910 --> 30:07.569
There is an influenza about,
a nasty one.

30:07.605 --> 30:09.640
She needs to be careful.
Give her my best.

30:11.044 --> 30:12.576
You know, Sergeant,

30:12.612 --> 30:16.350
if we're to have a decent,
godly, law-abiding town,

30:16.386 --> 30:18.889
this sort of nonsense needs to
be brought under control.

30:18.924 --> 30:21.316
- Oi! You can't handle
two of our women.

30:21.351 --> 30:22.793
- I'll do my best!

30:22.829 --> 30:24.787
- Enough!
Come, children.

30:36.504 --> 30:38.501
-- There. Have a good day.
-- Thank you.

30:38.537 --> 30:41.076
- Afternoon.
Sergeant Nate Clintoff.

30:41.111 --> 30:42.912
I wonder if I might ask you
a few questions.

30:42.948 --> 30:45.049
-- Mmm.
- Have you seen this man?

30:46.081 --> 30:47.645
Wonder if you've seen this man.

30:48.820 --> 30:50.747
- Shoot the bastard if I do.

30:50.783 --> 30:52.886
- Do you know Joe Johnson?
- Name doesn't ring a bell.

30:52.921 --> 30:53.959
- The drover?
- No.

30:55.495 --> 30:57.257
- Seen this man?

30:57.292 --> 31:00.429
- No. Can't say I have.
Sorry about that.

31:00.465 --> 31:01.901
Thank you.

31:02.799 --> 31:05.003
Sergeant Nate Clintoff?

31:05.700 --> 31:07.533
Sir?

31:09.337 --> 31:12.840
Alfred Eisenmangher.
District Court Judge.

31:12.875 --> 31:15.780
A pleasure, Your Honour.

31:15.816 --> 31:17.848
A little more
than you bargained for.

31:17.883 --> 31:20.050
They did say a big day
for the Sale.

31:20.085 --> 31:23.054
Walking straight into
a murder investigation.

31:24.151 --> 31:27.126
Children, for goodness' sake.

31:27.161 --> 31:31.263
We make an example of anyone who
commits murder from here on in.

31:31.299 --> 31:32.660
Understood, Sir.

31:32.696 --> 31:34.659
Walk with me.

31:35.964 --> 31:38.961
We must be diligent.

31:38.996 --> 31:42.205
The Edwards are a prominent
family here in the high country.

31:43.040 --> 31:45.202
They've been here since
the 1820s.

31:45.237 --> 31:47.343
Our founding fathers.

31:47.379 --> 31:51.007
It's their money progressing
Everton to further development.

31:52.650 --> 31:54.512
If Edwards leaves

31:54.547 --> 31:58.989
his money goes with him,
and the town folds.

31:59.025 --> 32:02.823
And my retirement plan
falls over.

32:02.858 --> 32:04.260
As we speak, Sir,

32:04.295 --> 32:06.090
waiting on word from outposts
to the north and south

32:06.126 --> 32:07.255
for trooper support.

32:07.291 --> 32:08.432
- Hm-mm.

32:11.967 --> 32:13.501
Welcome to Everton.

32:13.536 --> 32:16.868
If you make it past Sunday,
I'll officially swear you in.

32:20.241 --> 32:22.204
- Good day.

32:29.383 --> 32:31.782
- Mm-hm.

32:36.992 --> 32:38.530
Afternoon, gentlemen.

32:38.565 --> 32:40.662
Sergeant Nate Clintoff.

32:40.698 --> 32:42.697
Martha Murray.

32:42.733 --> 32:44.526
Marti preferred.

32:44.561 --> 32:48.632
Um, I'm looking for Joe Johnson.

32:48.668 --> 32:51.970
Joe Johnson.

32:52.005 --> 32:53.406
Parsen, eh?

32:53.442 --> 32:56.372
- He's in Robert Parsen's team.
- Parsen's.

32:56.407 --> 32:58.045
Joe Johnson's yaraman.

33:02.819 --> 33:05.154
There's his horse.

33:05.190 --> 33:06.990
She's keen to get home,
by the look of her.

33:07.026 --> 33:08.894
- I was hoping
Mr Johnson was too.

33:08.929 --> 33:10.590
- Well, a man's
gotta have a fight,

33:10.626 --> 33:12.724
a feed and a fuck before facing
the family, Sergeant.

33:15.028 --> 33:16.800
My pardon.

33:16.835 --> 33:18.327
Was it his family murdered?

33:18.362 --> 33:19.597
Word's out, then?

33:19.632 --> 33:21.171
- Oh, word travels fast
around here,

33:21.206 --> 33:23.240
considering the distance
it takes to get anywhere.

33:23.275 --> 33:26.142
-- Don't know 'im, boss.
- It wasn't his family,

33:26.178 --> 33:27.879
but it was in the proximity
of his property

33:27.914 --> 33:29.410
so just bringing it
to his attention

33:29.446 --> 33:31.708
the urgency to get home
to his wife and children.

33:31.744 --> 33:33.350
- Get out of it, McPharlen.
Leave her alone.

33:33.385 --> 33:35.921
Well, it looks like you're
in luck. There's Parsen's team.

33:35.956 --> 33:37.617
- Got a meeting
with a blackfella.

33:37.652 --> 33:40.950
- Up at the boxing tent.
- You gonna have a go, Parsen?

33:40.985 --> 33:45.290
- Thank you, I could use some.
- You'll be right, mate.

33:45.325 --> 33:47.066
Show 'em what you're made of.

33:51.302 --> 33:54.839
- Very fine cooks.
Best feed around here.

33:54.875 --> 33:56.466
- Maurice,
what do we think?

33:56.502 --> 33:57.973
-- It's gone.
- Sorry?

33:58.008 --> 33:59.373
My wallet has gone. Sergeant!

33:59.408 --> 34:01.736
- Sergeant, I've been robbed!
- Excuse me!

34:01.772 --> 34:03.607
That bloody drunken rogue
swaggy!

34:03.642 --> 34:05.845
- He went that way!
- Go, man, go!

34:05.880 --> 34:08.285
Ugh! Egh!

34:14.926 --> 34:16.821
- Go on, get up! Get up!

34:18.796 --> 34:20.330
Let's get him.

34:24.463 --> 34:27.473
Go on! That's it.
Come on!

34:30.174 --> 34:32.903
- Knock him out.
Knock him out!

34:34.208 --> 34:36.445
Hit him! Hit him hard!

34:42.617 --> 34:45.322
Smash him in the head.
Smash him in the head!

34:45.922 --> 34:47.159
Get the bastard.

34:59.739 --> 35:01.602
Good stuff, Sergeant.

35:05.704 --> 35:08.237
-- Yeah. Yeah.

35:08.272 --> 35:09.577
Not bad.

35:10.945 --> 35:12.107
Trooper.

35:15.755 --> 35:17.321
- Back to business.

36:57.285 --> 36:59.255
I don't think I am.

36:59.290 --> 37:01.789
Where's your boots?
You lose 'em?

37:01.825 --> 37:03.089
No.

37:03.125 --> 37:04.362
Where's yours?

37:05.792 --> 37:08.691
Got none. What do you do
when the snow falls?

37:08.726 --> 37:11.637
You ask a lot of questions.

37:11.672 --> 37:12.995
Ma says that too.

37:13.030 --> 37:14.867
But if you don't ask,
you don't know, eh?

37:16.439 --> 37:18.205
You answer all the questions
you ask?

37:18.240 --> 37:19.976
Yes, Sir. I like talking.

37:20.011 --> 37:21.445
We make up stories, too.

37:22.916 --> 37:26.049
I tamed a bear in rough seas.

37:26.085 --> 37:28.546
Taught six horses how to dance.

37:28.582 --> 37:32.291
Fed a tiger with my bare hands.

37:32.326 --> 37:36.152
And once I was a clown
called Tippo in the circus.

37:37.362 --> 37:39.829
I'm twelve now,
but that's a good story.

37:39.864 --> 37:41.095
Twelve, huh?

37:41.130 --> 37:42.796
Three months back.

37:44.366 --> 37:46.170
You're ready for Men's Business.

37:46.205 --> 37:48.667
Is that the same
Men's Business my Da

37:48.703 --> 37:50.771
does with the whore
woman to the west?

37:52.842 --> 37:56.241
That's what Ma calls her.
I think that's her last name.

37:59.050 --> 38:00.284
No, this Men's Business

38:00.319 --> 38:02.344
is different from
your Da's Men's Business.

38:02.379 --> 38:05.088
But one day you'll be interested
in his Men's Business too.

38:05.124 --> 38:08.417
So, what's your Men's Business?

38:08.452 --> 38:11.763
Your responsibilities to your
Ma, your brothers, your sister.

38:11.798 --> 38:14.124
The chores you do.

38:15.325 --> 38:17.800
Special lessons learnt about
the animals, the land,

38:17.836 --> 38:19.701
the stars.

38:20.665 --> 38:23.166
The final ask would be

38:24.008 --> 38:26.169
your first kill.

38:31.611 --> 38:35.244
Kill swiftly. No suffering.

38:35.279 --> 38:40.050
Extend your arm behind you,
level with your shoulder.

38:40.085 --> 38:43.252
One action, straight through.
Shoulder and hip.

39:08.813 --> 39:10.421
So our feet don't get cold,

39:10.456 --> 39:12.588
when we see the first mist
rise in the valley,

39:12.624 --> 39:15.493
we head down the mountain
and north for the winter.

39:15.529 --> 39:17.891
We've had the first mist.
What are you still doing here?

39:17.926 --> 39:21.158
It's not for want of trying,
Danny, let me tell you.

39:24.471 --> 39:27.304
I'm supposed to be getting
Da's boots this winter.

39:27.339 --> 39:29.265
I'll have to chock the heel,
though.

39:31.902 --> 39:34.476
From when Da was a little fella.

39:34.511 --> 39:38.379
His Da broke it.
Didn't fix it right.

39:38.414 --> 39:40.075
But I'm too quick for my Da.

39:40.111 --> 39:41.882
He whipped his belt at me,
buckle end.

39:49.425 --> 39:52.359
He didn't mean it. He was drunk.

39:52.394 --> 39:54.532
He does silly things.

39:59.834 --> 40:02.407
It's not what you wear
on your feet, Danny.

40:02.443 --> 40:05.774
It's how you carry yourself
makes a decent man.

40:15.813 --> 40:18.413
Come on. Have a throw.

40:25.328 --> 40:27.427
Arm extended behind you.

40:27.462 --> 40:28.962
Level with your shoulder.

40:35.533 --> 40:37.399
Alright.

40:38.375 --> 40:39.874
One action, straight through.

40:45.248 --> 40:47.244
Shoulder and hip.

40:50.482 --> 40:52.414
Good.

41:05.972 --> 41:08.265
Bless you. Come.

41:34.992 --> 41:37.327
Must keep the filing even.

41:38.734 --> 41:41.496
Craftsmanship and patience,
Danny.

41:44.202 --> 41:45.902
That song you were singing
this morning.

41:45.938 --> 41:47.975
Your Granddey's favourite, hey?

41:48.011 --> 41:50.612
- Sang it while he worked,
sang it while he ate.

41:50.648 --> 41:53.081
Sang it in his sleep.
Speaking of, bed.

41:53.117 --> 41:54.946
- Oh!

41:54.982 --> 41:56.585
Son, you have to be up
at sparrow's fart

41:56.620 --> 41:58.480
to collect your brothers
and sister.

41:59.493 --> 42:01.892
I was hoping I could help Yadaka
finish the wood.

42:01.927 --> 42:03.628
Daniel!

42:16.066 --> 42:18.905
A story, please, Ma! Please?

42:18.941 --> 42:22.444
The bullock one.
Yadaka might want to hear it.

42:22.479 --> 42:24.372
No, Yadaka, you tell your story,

42:24.407 --> 42:26.541
about the clown called
Tippo in the circus.

42:32.158 --> 42:33.949
Fillis Circus, Missus.

42:33.984 --> 42:36.451
South African circus.

42:36.487 --> 42:39.427
I was good with the children
that came to watch.

42:39.462 --> 42:41.763
Started in my homelands.

42:41.798 --> 42:45.599
Land of the coloured sands
and rainforest.

42:45.635 --> 42:48.406
They abandoned me in Melbourne.

42:48.441 --> 42:51.236
I was arrested
for being destitute.

42:52.271 --> 42:55.207
Father Matthews procured
my release from jail.

42:56.545 --> 42:58.339
He gave me a white name.

42:58.375 --> 43:00.551
- A white name?
- But I don't use it.

43:00.586 --> 43:04.613
Taught me to read, write,
and play the tuba.

43:04.649 --> 43:06.253
Mmm.

43:06.288 --> 43:11.055
- About ten days back now,
Ma went to put the broom away.

43:11.091 --> 43:13.330
She hears this snortin'
and gruntin.'

43:13.366 --> 43:15.994
The others are out back,
playing.

43:16.029 --> 43:18.931
Ma goes to the door.
Cracks it open.

43:18.966 --> 43:21.539
There's this big
bloody wild bullock,

43:21.574 --> 43:23.072
horns the width
of a grown man's arm span.

43:23.107 --> 43:25.701
Brrrrrr!

43:25.736 --> 43:27.811
Ay! Ah!

43:27.846 --> 43:30.413
My brothers and sister
start to move around front.

43:30.449 --> 43:32.244
The bullock looks over at them.

43:34.748 --> 43:36.410
- I give Ma the gun.

43:36.446 --> 43:38.580
She uses the door frame
as her guide.

43:39.424 --> 43:40.919
- Bang!

43:40.955 --> 43:43.126
Shot him
straight between the eyes.

43:43.161 --> 43:44.487
- What?

43:45.792 --> 43:47.357
What'd you just say?

43:47.393 --> 43:49.866
How you shot the bullock
straight between the eyes.

43:56.536 --> 43:58.270
Ma?

43:59.871 --> 44:01.878
Goodnight, son.

44:03.281 --> 44:05.145
Night, Yadaka.

44:22.636 --> 44:25.198
- The last few days
are catching up on me.

45:43.313 --> 45:45.443
No!

45:47.045 --> 45:49.821
Missus, it's me. It's me!

45:52.956 --> 45:54.884
Found this tucked underneath
the workbench.

45:54.920 --> 45:56.751
Give it here.

45:57.691 --> 45:59.226
Goodnight.

47:22.207 --> 47:24.377
No throwing it at your brothers.

47:26.311 --> 47:28.084
-- Danny.

47:31.949 --> 47:34.024
Danny.

47:58.316 --> 48:00.149
Come on.

48:52.562 --> 48:54.900
-- Bless you.

48:54.936 --> 48:58.073
Thank you.

48:58.109 --> 49:01.936
As I was saying,
I wonder what Mrs Johnson's had?

49:03.310 --> 49:05.882
A new baby,
wouldn't it be wonderful?

49:05.917 --> 49:08.418
Little baby to 'goo'
and 'gah' over.

49:08.454 --> 49:10.752
You promised.

49:10.787 --> 49:13.318
I'm worried about you.

49:13.353 --> 49:15.950
- I'll send for a doctor.

49:20.397 --> 49:23.026
I would love to go up there
and see her and the new...

49:23.062 --> 49:24.595
How thoughtless.

49:24.631 --> 49:27.301
We should have offered
to take the children back.

49:27.336 --> 49:29.474
I can't get out to see her
regarding business,

49:29.509 --> 49:31.832
let alone for leisure.

49:31.867 --> 49:33.840
Certainly not with you
as sick as you are.

49:33.875 --> 49:34.936
- Mmm.
- Mmm.

49:35.814 --> 49:37.477
I hope she's alright out there.

49:38.609 --> 49:40.783
Any advancements
on the murder case?

49:40.818 --> 49:43.481
Ahh, once reinforcements arrive,

49:43.516 --> 49:45.648
we'll head back out
to the Edwards' property

49:45.684 --> 49:48.158
for a thorough search
and we'll go from there.

49:49.857 --> 49:51.689
What's this?

49:59.065 --> 50:01.204
Oh, good Lord.

50:03.238 --> 50:05.341
- That's the perfect gift.
- Mmm.

50:05.377 --> 50:08.439
Papa told me to give it to you
the day after your first day.

50:08.474 --> 50:10.246
He said you would
appreciate it more.

50:11.482 --> 50:12.875
- Oh.

50:12.910 --> 50:14.850
How'd you keep it hidden?

50:14.885 --> 50:16.415
Well, the real question is,

50:16.451 --> 50:19.147
how did I keep it dry
in that blasted river?

50:24.661 --> 50:26.154
- Mmm.

50:26.190 --> 50:27.956
Thank you.

50:30.563 --> 50:33.703
Uh, could you fix
Trooper Leslie a plate?

50:33.739 --> 50:35.638
He's been there all night.

50:35.673 --> 50:37.870
Yes, of course.

50:37.905 --> 50:39.902
But first...

50:48.411 --> 50:50.583
Well, well, well.

50:51.650 --> 50:53.920
First published female
writer in Everton.

50:55.158 --> 50:56.926
Which is named after
Evelyn Edwards.

50:56.962 --> 50:58.361
How's that for
some local trivia?

50:58.397 --> 50:59.521
Mmm.

50:59.557 --> 51:02.694
Founding family, arrived 1820s.

51:02.730 --> 51:06.260
Folklore has it, Charles Edwards
fathered a Black child.

51:06.296 --> 51:08.336
Whitest...

51:08.372 --> 51:10.905
Whitest 'something' around,
something like that.

51:10.940 --> 51:13.369
- What?

51:13.404 --> 51:15.211
Um, well, may one ask,

51:15.246 --> 51:17.739
under what guise did this
conversation take place?

51:17.774 --> 51:20.074
Well, Miss Shirley
called it history.

51:24.916 --> 51:29.193
'Battered Wives - Is it
purely a husband's right?'

51:32.165 --> 51:35.298
It's a serious topic
to introduce yourself with.

51:37.663 --> 51:40.563
Well I'm very serious about
this, Nate.

51:40.599 --> 51:43.908
My sister remained silent
and died.

51:43.943 --> 51:47.206
City life, bush,
or mountain country,

51:47.241 --> 51:49.405
we need to give it a voice.

51:49.440 --> 51:51.413
It needs legislation.

51:56.420 --> 51:59.586
You look very handsome in
your hat, Sergeant Clintoff.

52:23.873 --> 52:26.448
- This is a first.
- New legislation.

52:34.859 --> 52:36.759
Joe Johnson head home?

52:36.794 --> 52:38.592
Was he in town?

52:38.627 --> 52:40.426
Well, his horse was tethered
to a tree in the yard.

52:40.461 --> 52:41.858
- So I am assuming.
- Mc- No.

52:41.893 --> 52:44.134
We found his horse running
with some brumbies.

52:44.170 --> 52:45.836
- We're headin' out there
later today,

52:45.871 --> 52:47.330
see if me old mate's alright.

52:47.366 --> 52:49.668
Take his horse back.

52:49.703 --> 52:51.833
First time in eight years
he's missed the drove.

52:51.869 --> 52:54.839
First time. Eight years.
Missed the drove.

52:58.112 --> 52:59.976
Why you askin'?

53:02.414 --> 53:03.445
Thank you, gentlemen.

53:05.857 --> 53:08.149
Gentlemen's a bit much.

53:08.760 --> 53:10.756
But gidday to ya.

53:14.864 --> 53:16.025
Good luck.

53:30.076 --> 53:31.777
Sir?

54:16.353 --> 54:18.362
Louisa?

54:23.668 --> 54:25.336
Darling?

54:28.103 --> 54:31.199
Nate.

54:33.106 --> 54:34.242
Hmmm?

54:34.278 --> 54:35.678
I'm heading out
to the Johnson's.

54:35.713 --> 54:36.941
Hmmm...

54:37.748 --> 54:39.449
Louisa?

55:10.311 --> 55:12.449
I'll fix your hair.

56:28.819 --> 56:30.989
Your features are quite fine.

56:32.359 --> 56:33.797
White father.

56:33.833 --> 56:35.290
You know him?

56:36.335 --> 56:38.997
I don't think my mother
even knew him.

56:42.666 --> 56:44.366
You got family?

56:44.402 --> 56:47.007
You?

56:47.042 --> 56:48.908
I did.

56:52.482 --> 56:55.310
Black shining skin
in full moonlight.

56:58.486 --> 57:02.185
And when she danced, smooth.

57:03.318 --> 57:06.288
Like shallow running water
over river rocks.

57:08.331 --> 57:11.363
I found my wife and my children,

57:11.399 --> 57:15.002
all the old people,

57:15.037 --> 57:17.398
dead.

57:20.111 --> 57:22.436
Reading the tracks.

57:23.544 --> 57:26.374
My family forced into the river.

57:27.415 --> 57:29.718
The water slowing them.

57:32.324 --> 57:35.119
They were fired upon,
from both banks.

57:38.159 --> 57:40.322
Murdered.

57:42.693 --> 57:45.159
Tribe put me out.

57:45.194 --> 57:47.197
I wouldn't go with them
for payback.

57:49.372 --> 57:52.172
I knew nothing would come of it.

57:52.208 --> 57:54.340
Too many whites.

57:54.375 --> 57:56.811
Too many guns now.

58:05.453 --> 58:07.855
I didn't know my Ma.

58:08.985 --> 58:11.628
She died giving birth to me.

58:14.129 --> 58:16.626
Molly.

58:16.661 --> 58:19.328
Pet name to Mary.

58:27.506 --> 58:29.041
It is you.

58:30.448 --> 58:33.382
That Ngarigo woman
that helped you.

58:33.418 --> 58:37.412
Ginny May.
She's my adopted mother.

58:37.447 --> 58:39.821
On the night you were born,
she held you in her arms

58:39.856 --> 58:42.890
while your father cried over
your dead mother's body.

58:42.925 --> 58:46.325
Gins help white women
in childbirth all the time.

58:46.361 --> 58:47.692
She's helped me.

58:47.727 --> 58:49.290
Ginny May kept the story alive

58:49.325 --> 58:51.965
of her sister's love
for a man of wrong skin.

58:52.828 --> 58:54.866
Black Mary.

58:54.901 --> 58:57.365
Fire red hair,
"whitest gin around."

58:57.400 --> 58:59.542
That's what the district folk
would call her.

58:59.577 --> 59:02.410
Black Mary worked as a cook
for some drovers

59:02.445 --> 59:04.978
and your Da was one of them.

59:06.743 --> 59:08.347
Your mother.

59:08.382 --> 59:09.884
She's Black.

59:12.090 --> 59:13.989
You are done here.

59:14.024 --> 59:17.719
Ginny May knew that Black Mary's
love for the Scotsman was real,

59:17.755 --> 59:19.628
and his for her.

59:19.663 --> 59:21.694
Your mother and father
kept to themselves

59:21.730 --> 59:23.198
'cause no-one
would accept them.

59:23.234 --> 59:25.128
Their love was deep

59:25.163 --> 59:27.402
as the highest peak
to the lowest valley

59:27.438 --> 59:29.532
and as wild as the Snowy River.

59:29.567 --> 59:31.198
Stop!

59:31.234 --> 59:33.168
- Black Mary's
your mother.

59:33.204 --> 59:36.105
Ngarigo, your family.
No shame in that.

59:36.140 --> 59:38.347
You take your filthy
talking mouth

59:38.383 --> 59:41.246
and you get the fuck off
my land.

59:41.282 --> 59:43.115
Go!

59:47.483 --> 59:49.957
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

59:51.520 --> 59:53.194
- Whoa, whoa. Steady, girl.

59:53.230 --> 59:54.390
Steady on now.

59:55.490 --> 59:57.793
I heard yelling.
Is everything alright here?

59:57.828 --> 1:00:00.161
Yes, thank you.

1:00:00.197 --> 1:00:02.596
Missus,
I'll attend to my duties.

1:00:03.240 --> 1:00:05.269
Don't you move!

1:00:06.409 --> 1:00:09.405
Good Lord. It is you.

1:00:10.380 --> 1:00:11.881
In the Queen's name,

1:00:11.916 --> 1:00:15.312
I arrest you for the murder
of Mrs Edwards and her children.

1:00:16.553 --> 1:00:18.117
And you, Mrs Johnson, I'll need

1:00:18.152 --> 1:00:20.422
you to accompany me
to the lock-up for questioning.

1:00:20.457 --> 1:00:21.923
I didn't know he killed any...

1:00:21.958 --> 1:00:24.051
- Regarding the
whereabouts of your husband.

1:00:24.086 --> 1:00:26.022
He didn't make the drove.

1:00:26.058 --> 1:00:28.356
His fellow workers
found his horse.

1:00:28.391 --> 1:00:31.534
Now put down the gun,
Mrs Johnson, please.

1:00:31.569 --> 1:00:33.368
But my children
will be home soon.

1:00:33.403 --> 1:00:34.868
Stay down. I will shoot.

1:00:34.903 --> 1:00:36.473
- I can't go with you.
My children.

1:00:36.509 --> 1:00:38.005
I'm under strict orders
to bring you in.

1:00:38.041 --> 1:00:40.203
- If I come with you...
-- Mrs Johnson, please.

1:00:40.239 --> 1:00:41.574
- Take me, boss.
- What'll happen to my children?

1:00:41.609 --> 1:00:42.677
- Down.
- Take me.

1:00:42.712 --> 1:00:44.406
- Quiet!
- My children will be home soon.

1:00:44.442 --> 1:00:46.209
- Put the gun down!
-- I'm your concern.

1:00:46.244 --> 1:00:47.878
- Take me, boss.
- I will shoot! Mrs Johnson!

1:00:47.913 --> 1:00:49.376
What will happen to my children?

1:00:49.411 --> 1:00:50.547
-- Take me.
- Shut up, woman!

1:01:18.810 --> 1:01:21.312
Bury him deep.

1:01:30.321 --> 1:01:31.922
I've always thought that.

1:01:31.957 --> 1:01:34.498
Well, assumed it, actually.

1:01:34.533 --> 1:01:37.860
Molly Johnson's mother.
Black Mary.

1:01:37.896 --> 1:01:39.835
Whitest gin around.

1:01:39.870 --> 1:01:43.031
That's what the district folk
would call her.

1:01:43.066 --> 1:01:45.105
I remember the talk well.

1:01:46.202 --> 1:01:49.712
Cocksure woman. Spoke well.

1:01:49.747 --> 1:01:54.384
Held her head high.
Eyeballed her superiors.

1:01:54.419 --> 1:01:57.111
The audacity of the heathen.

1:01:57.146 --> 1:01:58.920
Mixed blood, you see.

1:01:58.956 --> 1:02:01.858
She thought it gave her
some sort of superiority.

1:02:02.855 --> 1:02:05.786
Men were infatuated.

1:02:05.821 --> 1:02:10.424
Rumour has it, Black Mary is
an offspring of Charles Edwards.

1:02:10.459 --> 1:02:12.361
FATHER Mc-
Now, now, sister.

1:02:12.396 --> 1:02:14.729
"If any man among you
seem to be religious

1:02:14.764 --> 1:02:18.199
"and bridleth not his tongue
but deceiveth his own heart,

1:02:18.234 --> 1:02:20.244
"this man's religion is vain."

1:02:20.279 --> 1:02:22.778
- James 1, Verse 26.

1:02:22.813 --> 1:02:25.376
Forgive me, dear brother,
for I have sinned.

1:02:27.117 --> 1:02:31.151
Octoroons is what I would call
Molly Johnson's children.

1:02:32.119 --> 1:02:36.189
Just a touch of the tar brush,
but enough.

1:02:42.224 --> 1:02:44.128
For their protection,

1:02:44.163 --> 1:02:47.035
the children's removal
is authorised.

1:02:52.737 --> 1:02:54.537
Ohhh.

1:04:50.192 --> 1:04:53.623
- I should be leaving, Missus.
- You should.

1:04:57.633 --> 1:04:59.233
Come with me.

1:05:16.221 --> 1:05:17.779
Molly.

1:05:22.185 --> 1:05:25.027
There's a cave.

1:05:25.062 --> 1:05:29.032
North-east, two and a half days'
walk from here.

1:05:30.695 --> 1:05:34.433
You'll come to the great
waterhole. Keep to the right.

1:05:35.865 --> 1:05:38.932
You'll hit Snowgum Alley.
Keep the range on your left.

1:05:40.274 --> 1:05:43.437
As it thickens,
there's a cluster of rocks

1:05:43.473 --> 1:05:46.379
that looks like a...a fortress.

1:05:48.144 --> 1:05:50.586
It's there.

1:05:50.621 --> 1:05:54.755
Food, shelter, blankets.

1:05:54.791 --> 1:05:57.789
And in the spring, people.

1:05:57.824 --> 1:06:00.327
Your people.

1:06:02.897 --> 1:06:05.464
That's where I'm heading.

1:06:07.231 --> 1:06:09.270
I'll fix you some food.

1:06:19.647 --> 1:06:21.150
Nate.

1:06:22.147 --> 1:06:25.382
Did you believe her?

1:06:25.417 --> 1:06:28.190
I'm fine, thank you
for your concern.

1:06:34.663 --> 1:06:36.660
I'm sorry.

1:06:41.398 --> 1:06:43.535
Who were you referring to?

1:06:44.443 --> 1:06:46.332
Doesn't matter.

1:06:46.368 --> 1:06:47.534
Well, it must.

1:06:47.569 --> 1:06:49.341
You, standing at the window

1:06:49.376 --> 1:06:52.082
at this ridiculous hour
of the morning.

1:06:57.148 --> 1:06:59.683
Molly Johnson.

1:07:02.590 --> 1:07:06.762
Her husband, waving his hat,
with joy at seeing the children.

1:07:06.797 --> 1:07:09.462
Somehow it didn't ring true.

1:07:09.497 --> 1:07:12.663
The look on her children's faces
gave it away as well.

1:07:36.618 --> 1:07:38.289
You will be my saving grace

1:07:38.325 --> 1:07:40.526
if I can blame you
for all of this.

1:07:41.290 --> 1:07:43.056
The Trooper.

1:07:43.797 --> 1:07:45.234
My Joe.

1:07:47.405 --> 1:07:50.666
I'm sorry, but my children need
me. They need their mother.

1:07:50.701 --> 1:07:52.703
I'd never just kill
for the sake of it,

1:07:52.738 --> 1:07:55.678
but fight for my children,
fight for my life, I will.

1:07:55.713 --> 1:07:57.609
Make no excuses for it.

1:08:00.586 --> 1:08:03.043
That's what you did?

1:08:09.621 --> 1:08:12.789
He's buried there,
under the wood heap.

1:08:12.824 --> 1:08:16.460
His grave, shallow.
That's why the mound was there.

1:08:16.495 --> 1:08:18.630
The children were going to be
up soon.

1:08:19.565 --> 1:08:22.062
Just stacked
the last of the wood on top.

1:08:25.334 --> 1:08:27.510
Take them.

1:08:27.546 --> 1:08:29.740
For your safety.

1:08:30.978 --> 1:08:33.546
You're a good man.

1:08:37.447 --> 1:08:39.151
- She killed him.

1:08:39.187 --> 1:08:42.058
Why would you say such a thing?

1:08:42.093 --> 1:08:45.954
There was a smell around
the wood heap, so...

1:08:48.325 --> 1:08:50.662
Bittersweet smell.

1:08:52.561 --> 1:08:55.229
I've smelt it before.

1:08:55.264 --> 1:08:57.735
In war.

1:09:00.340 --> 1:09:02.773
I smelt it again,
at the Edwards'.

1:09:03.873 --> 1:09:06.779
Maybe Mrs Johnson
was protecting herself.

1:09:06.814 --> 1:09:08.779
Louisa.

1:09:10.355 --> 1:09:14.115
I know at the core of your
plight is your sister's death.

1:09:14.150 --> 1:09:17.552
But you can't pollute every man
and wife's marital dispute

1:09:17.587 --> 1:09:19.686
with your own biased perception.

1:09:19.721 --> 1:09:21.496
The boy related your injury

1:09:21.532 --> 1:09:24.894
to the normalcy of violence
inflicted upon one by a father.

1:09:26.035 --> 1:09:27.995
Why would one say such a thing

1:09:28.030 --> 1:09:30.838
if they had not a story
of their own to compare?

1:09:30.874 --> 1:09:33.606
This land needs law.

1:09:34.713 --> 1:09:36.936
Not a moral compass.

1:09:36.971 --> 1:09:38.848
Whilst hunting savages
in this land,

1:09:38.883 --> 1:09:41.108
please do not turn into one.

1:10:14.317 --> 1:10:17.744
Can I call on Danny,
say in six months' time?

1:10:17.779 --> 1:10:21.322
Please, it's too dangerous.

1:10:21.358 --> 1:10:24.261
Take him on his first kill,
with his spear.

1:10:25.291 --> 1:10:27.055
Thinking Men's Business.

1:10:28.062 --> 1:10:29.827
I promised him.

1:10:36.440 --> 1:10:40.043
And if I can take you
and your daughter on a walk

1:10:40.078 --> 1:10:42.807
where the Snowy
starts to widen...

1:10:44.611 --> 1:10:47.882
..there's these
beautiful wildflowers.

1:10:47.918 --> 1:10:50.353
Be blooming by then.

1:11:08.665 --> 1:11:10.701
Don't move, ya black bastard.

1:11:10.736 --> 1:11:12.903
I'll put a bullet
through your fuckin' head.

1:11:15.008 --> 1:11:16.546
Sit.

1:11:16.581 --> 1:11:18.271
Move!

1:11:25.923 --> 1:11:27.819
State your business.

1:11:29.321 --> 1:11:31.555
I drive with Joe.

1:11:31.591 --> 1:11:33.291
Except this drove
he didn't show.

1:11:33.327 --> 1:11:34.821
First time in eight years.

1:11:34.856 --> 1:11:36.592
And I felt obliged to drop by

1:11:36.628 --> 1:11:38.133
and see if me old mate's
alright.

1:11:38.169 --> 1:11:39.859
And on hearing
what I just heard,

1:11:39.895 --> 1:11:41.996
I'm more than a little worried.

1:11:42.032 --> 1:11:45.406
- No need to be, Mr...
- Parsen. Robert Parsen.

1:11:45.441 --> 1:11:47.540
No need for your concern,
Mr Robert Parsen.

1:11:47.576 --> 1:11:50.913
Who the fuck did you kill
to get them clothes?

1:11:50.948 --> 1:11:52.206
- Here.

1:11:53.417 --> 1:11:56.045
You dare look a white
man in the eye, jacky?

1:11:58.314 --> 1:12:03.386
I find your facial expression
inappropriate for a nigger.

1:12:03.422 --> 1:12:04.955
- Eugh!

1:12:06.296 --> 1:12:07.961
You wearing Joe's boots,
ya bastard!

1:12:07.997 --> 1:12:10.024
- No, wait!

1:12:10.059 --> 1:12:12.430
I gave them to him for some work
he had done.

1:12:12.465 --> 1:12:13.961
You got no shame, ya harlot!

1:12:13.996 --> 1:12:16.666
- I beg your pardon?
- You heard me.

1:12:16.702 --> 1:12:19.467
Now where's my mate?
Where's Joe?

1:12:19.503 --> 1:12:21.740
Gone. Left me.

1:12:21.776 --> 1:12:25.380
All alone with the children.
No food, no nothing.

1:12:25.415 --> 1:12:27.709
And my wee one dead,
dead from all the worry.

1:12:27.744 --> 1:12:29.516
And this man offered to help

1:12:29.551 --> 1:12:32.254
and for his time,
I gave him Joe's boots.

1:12:32.289 --> 1:12:34.149
What the fuck's Joe got
on his feet?

1:12:34.184 --> 1:12:36.922
I found him in a compromising
position with a whore.

1:12:36.957 --> 1:12:41.092
Riding him, she was, and it
wasn't fuckin' side saddle.

1:12:44.528 --> 1:12:46.099
Good for him.

1:12:46.135 --> 1:12:48.504
- Eugh!

1:12:59.982 --> 1:13:01.781
- No!

1:13:04.152 --> 1:13:05.620
Here, leave it!

1:13:15.326 --> 1:13:16.829
Fuck.

1:13:26.372 --> 1:13:28.236
Mc- Joe!

1:13:29.237 --> 1:13:31.712
Where the hell are ya,
ya useless bastard?

1:13:32.611 --> 1:13:34.578
What the fuck happened here?

1:13:34.613 --> 1:13:36.886
Rope up this Black bastard.

1:13:47.522 --> 1:13:53.102
Mc- Well, well, well.
Looky, looky here.

1:13:53.137 --> 1:13:54.894
- What took you so long?

1:13:54.929 --> 1:13:56.704
I had to take a shit.

1:14:16.460 --> 1:14:19.357
Mc- Hey.
These are Joe's boots.

1:14:19.392 --> 1:14:20.754
- Leave it.

1:14:23.832 --> 1:14:27.033
This hard-headed
bastard's still alive.

1:14:30.842 --> 1:14:33.741
Oh, hello.

1:14:37.876 --> 1:14:39.749
- Argh!
- Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1:14:39.784 --> 1:14:41.043
Hoo-hoo!

1:14:41.078 --> 1:14:44.246
Put it down. Or I'll put
a hole through ya.

1:14:48.752 --> 1:14:51.125
Are you gonna shoot her?

1:14:51.160 --> 1:14:52.826
Depends on her.

1:14:58.696 --> 1:15:00.570
Eugh!

1:15:05.871 --> 1:15:08.571
Please, my children.
My children!

1:15:08.606 --> 1:15:09.645
- Eugh!

1:16:42.402 --> 1:16:44.432
Ma, it's me.

1:18:23.866 --> 1:18:25.599
He dead, Ma?

1:18:27.677 --> 1:18:31.209
Two of your Da's mates
stopped by.

1:18:32.273 --> 1:18:34.443
They brought word about your Da.

1:18:35.411 --> 1:18:38.348
On the drove,
up in the high country.

1:18:39.950 --> 1:18:42.552
Your Da's horse slipped.

1:18:42.587 --> 1:18:44.083
Stop, Ma.

1:18:44.118 --> 1:18:45.792
Hitting his head.

1:18:45.828 --> 1:18:48.327
Dead. Something like that.
That'll do.

1:18:48.362 --> 1:18:49.494
No, Ma!

1:18:49.530 --> 1:18:51.196
It has to be.

1:18:52.565 --> 1:18:54.199
I know, Ma!

1:18:55.272 --> 1:18:57.400
Know what, son?

1:19:00.435 --> 1:19:03.373
Not a very happy night
for my birthday.

1:19:44.414 --> 1:19:48.121
Shaming me manhood
in front of a whore!

1:19:50.254 --> 1:19:52.493
Joe, please.

1:19:52.528 --> 1:19:53.962
Think of the children.

1:19:55.958 --> 1:19:57.022
Shoot him.

1:20:38.033 --> 1:20:40.074
Our secret.

1:20:43.807 --> 1:20:45.981
Danny?

1:20:50.652 --> 1:20:53.120
Where are the others?

1:20:55.349 --> 1:20:58.452
Did you say something?

1:20:58.487 --> 1:21:00.820
Where are your brothers
and sister?

1:21:01.530 --> 1:21:04.000
Miss Shirley.

1:21:04.035 --> 1:21:08.102
Miss Shirley told that judge
fella. Called us Octoroons.

1:21:10.572 --> 1:21:12.942
What's that, Ma?

1:21:17.481 --> 1:21:20.378
Come on. Get your coat.

1:21:49.312 --> 1:21:50.872
Come.

1:21:50.907 --> 1:21:52.410
Candle.

1:22:39.395 --> 1:22:42.257
You have been very good to me
and my children over the years

1:22:42.292 --> 1:22:44.425
and for that I am very grateful.

1:22:44.461 --> 1:22:46.263
But damn you to hell
for thinking

1:22:46.298 --> 1:22:48.334
you know what's best
for my children.

1:23:57.171 --> 1:24:00.868
I'm taking your gun
or the boy dies.

1:24:20.823 --> 1:24:23.891
Where are you two off to
on this fine morning?

1:24:29.330 --> 1:24:31.063
Well, huh?

1:24:33.735 --> 1:24:35.234
- I'm talkin' to ya, woman.

1:24:35.269 --> 1:24:36.442
Eugh!

1:24:37.813 --> 1:24:39.772
Tell him to put it down.

1:24:39.808 --> 1:24:42.415
-- Danny, please.
- On the ground.

1:24:43.115 --> 1:24:44.752
Please don't hurt my son.

1:24:44.788 --> 1:24:46.452
Well, that depends on him.

1:24:49.121 --> 1:24:51.787
Danny, put it down.

1:24:54.192 --> 1:24:56.297
Danny, put it down.

1:25:03.034 --> 1:25:04.404
Put it down.

1:25:08.174 --> 1:25:10.238
I'll do whatever you want.

1:25:10.274 --> 1:25:12.040
But please let my...

1:25:12.076 --> 1:25:14.381
my son go.

1:25:14.949 --> 1:25:16.342
-- Ma!
- Eugh!

1:25:24.758 --> 1:25:26.190
Danny.

1:25:26.225 --> 1:25:30.666
I'll meet you there. Remember?

1:25:30.701 --> 1:25:35.570
The cave we spoke about?
