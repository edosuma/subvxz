WEBVTT

00:00.292 --> 00:04.094
Welcome to the ceremonial
lighting of the first burner.

00:04.096 --> 00:05.896
Come on, Susan!

00:05.898 --> 00:07.397
There it is!
(Cece gasps)
Aah!

00:07.399 --> 00:09.766
Thanksgiving!
It is 7:00 a.m.

00:09.768 --> 00:11.134
I've actually been up
for two hours.

00:11.136 --> 00:13.337
Let's do this!
Perfect Thanksgiving!

00:13.339 --> 00:14.938
Reagan's coming today,
and I want everything

00:14.940 --> 00:17.240
to be great
for<i> the</i> guest of honor.

00:17.242 --> 00:18.809
Oh,<i> the... the</i> guest
of honor?

00:18.811 --> 00:19.843
Yeah, the guest
of honor.

00:19.845 --> 00:21.745
I guess my dad spending
Thanksgiving with me

00:21.747 --> 00:23.513
for the first time ever
is a non-event.

00:23.515 --> 00:26.083
Ooh. Is he bringing
his new squoosh?
Hmm?

00:26.085 --> 00:27.784
Is that a thing
people say?
No.

00:27.786 --> 00:31.288
Uh-uh.
Well, his<i> squoosh </i>
has a name, and it's Ann Kim.

00:31.290 --> 00:32.689
She's probably gonna want
to spend some time

00:32.691 --> 00:34.291
with you ladies, too,
because you know

00:34.293 --> 00:35.959
how fathers and sons
can be on Thanksgiving.

00:35.961 --> 00:38.428
Drinking beer,
watching the game,

00:38.430 --> 00:39.930
hugging each other in a way

00:39.932 --> 00:41.999
that suggests, "I forgive you
for every-- for everything."

00:42.001 --> 00:44.101
Okay, look, I know
you're excited, but maybe

00:44.103 --> 00:45.769
don't put so much
pressure on it, you know?

00:45.771 --> 00:48.005
I mean, we all... we
all know who your dad is.

00:48.007 --> 00:50.140
Who he was.
Who he was, though.

00:50.142 --> 00:51.341
Just don't expect too much.

00:51.343 --> 00:52.609
Just be happy that
he's coming at all.

00:52.611 --> 00:53.610
So what time's Robby coming?

00:53.612 --> 00:54.811
He's not coming.

00:54.813 --> 00:56.213
He is going to visit his folks.

00:56.215 --> 00:57.447
What's your guys' deal now?

00:57.449 --> 00:58.782
Are you actually together,

00:58.784 --> 01:00.317
or are you just
nursing him back to health

01:00.319 --> 01:02.152
'cause you broke his entire
body and face?

01:02.154 --> 01:05.555
We are not together, but I don't
think Robby understands that.

01:05.557 --> 01:06.857
I wonder why, Jess.

01:06.859 --> 01:08.792
You only hang out with him 24/7.

01:08.794 --> 01:11.294
¶ Come on, baby,
make it hurt so... ¶

01:11.296 --> 01:13.196
(screaming)

01:13.198 --> 01:14.698
I feel mean telling him
we're not dating

01:14.700 --> 01:16.066
when he's in this state.

01:16.068 --> 01:17.667
CECE:
It is a lot

01:17.669 --> 01:19.636
meaner to lead him on, okay?

01:19.638 --> 01:20.904
You got to drop the hammer.

01:20.906 --> 01:22.239
I know. You're right.

01:22.241 --> 01:23.640
I'll do it
next time I see him.

01:23.642 --> 01:24.808
I'm just dreading it.

01:24.810 --> 01:26.209
He's such a good egg.

01:26.211 --> 01:28.378
I mean, with his dad khakis

01:28.380 --> 01:30.981
and his glasses
and his... his...

01:30.983 --> 01:32.749
his sweet little change purse.

01:32.751 --> 01:33.750
You know what?

01:33.752 --> 01:36.086
That's it. He's too nice.

01:36.088 --> 01:37.854
There's just no oomph.
Yeah.

01:37.856 --> 01:39.890
It's non-negotiable.
You got to have the oomph.

01:39.892 --> 01:43.026
Yeah,<i> oomph</i> was all Cece and
I had when we started oomphing.

01:43.028 --> 01:44.194
Oh, "oomph" is sex.

01:44.196 --> 01:46.029
Why say that stupid word?
Just say "sex."

01:46.031 --> 01:47.864
Oh, because
it's more than that, Nick.

01:47.866 --> 01:49.733
It's fire. It's passion.

01:49.735 --> 01:51.401
It's ha-cha-cha-cha-cha,
cha-cha-cha-cha-cha.
Mm.

01:51.403 --> 01:52.903
JESS:
And there's no ha-cha-cha

01:52.905 --> 01:54.771
with Robby. He's too nice.
WINSTON:
Well, look,

01:54.773 --> 01:57.240
Jess, do what you got to,
but I love that guy.

01:57.242 --> 01:58.875
Robby was there for me

01:58.877 --> 02:01.344
when I got hurt
in the line of duty.

02:01.346 --> 02:03.280
(groaning)
SCHMIDT:
Winston,

02:03.282 --> 02:05.916
you sprained your ankle
running for a bagel.

02:05.918 --> 02:08.351
Yeah. I was at
work, though.
Running for a bagel.

02:08.353 --> 02:10.720
Look, Robby's the only one
who understands my pain.

02:10.722 --> 02:13.090
Well, nothing makes me happier
than cooking for ten hours

02:13.092 --> 02:15.725
and eating in under 25 minutes.
Chant me in.

02:15.727 --> 02:17.727
ALL (chanting):
Stuff that bird!

02:17.729 --> 02:20.931
Stuff that bird!
Stuff that bird!

02:20.933 --> 02:23.366
Guess who's too
injured to fly?

02:23.368 --> 02:24.901
Is it you?

02:24.903 --> 02:26.970
¶ ¶

02:28.707 --> 02:30.373
JESS:<i> Don't get me wrong.</i>
<i> I mean, I feel,</i>

02:30.375 --> 02:31.441
I feel like I'm holding

02:31.443 --> 02:33.143
the long end of the wishbone
right now, but,

02:33.145 --> 02:35.912
um, why wouldn't
they let you on the plane?

02:35.914 --> 02:37.380
There was a fit issue.

02:37.382 --> 02:38.715
(groans)
I'm sorry. All right.

02:38.717 --> 02:39.916
I'm so sorry.
(screams)
Oh! Oh!

02:39.918 --> 02:41.151
Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.
Whoa. Whoa.

02:41.153 --> 02:42.819
(screams) No, no, no,
it's fine.
Oh! Oh!

02:42.821 --> 02:44.387
Well, at least you had the fun

02:44.389 --> 02:46.756
of going to the airport
on Thanksgiving.

02:46.758 --> 02:49.259
And I get to hang out with you.
(indistinct chatter on TV)

02:49.261 --> 02:51.828
Yay! And boo! Because

02:51.830 --> 02:54.297
I already have plans
with a 15-pound cutie.

02:54.299 --> 02:56.666
(laughs)
I'm talking about the turkey.
(laughs)

02:56.668 --> 02:59.069
Listen, I'm gonna plant you
in front of the parade,

02:59.071 --> 03:02.105
and you're gonna yell out
what balloons go by!

03:02.107 --> 03:04.141
Okay. Okay.
MAN (on TV):
The start of the parade just...

03:04.143 --> 03:06.643
(laughs)
With the speed?!

03:06.645 --> 03:07.777
He like Mayweather
with the knife!

03:07.779 --> 03:09.112
CECE:
Okay, what is going on?

03:09.114 --> 03:11.314
Because you don't even use
a knife to eat a steak?

03:11.316 --> 03:13.917
Well, my girl is coming.
Of course my hands are dancing.

03:13.919 --> 03:16.686
These knives are a part of me
like that, uh, scissor hand guy.

03:16.688 --> 03:18.688
What is his name again?
Is it Rick Snip?

03:18.690 --> 03:21.525
Did you drop the hammer?
I have<i> not</i> dropped the hammer.

03:21.527 --> 03:23.026
Snoopy! Saw Snoopy.

03:23.028 --> 03:24.995
Okay, no. You-you
got to end this.

03:24.997 --> 03:27.364
ROBBY:
False alarm. It's just John
Stamos on a Greek yogurt float.

03:27.366 --> 03:28.765
Drop the hammer now?

03:28.767 --> 03:30.367
He can't even tell
the difference

03:30.369 --> 03:31.935
between John Stamos and Snoopy.

03:31.937 --> 03:33.803
You can't break a man's heart
on a holiday.

03:33.805 --> 03:35.872
I'm telling you,
it happened to me once,

03:35.874 --> 03:38.542
and that pain-- it comes back
year after year after year.

03:38.544 --> 03:40.010
You don't want to do that
to him, I'm telling you.

03:40.012 --> 03:41.444
That's why I'm always a hot mess

03:41.446 --> 03:42.979
on take-your-daughter-to-work
day.

03:42.981 --> 03:44.014
ROBBY:
Uh-oh.

03:44.016 --> 03:45.382
It's the senior citizens choir.

03:45.384 --> 03:46.483
Get the tissues!

03:46.485 --> 03:47.651
WINSTON:
Look, I'll tell you what, Jess.

03:47.653 --> 03:49.152
I'll keep him busy for the day.

03:49.154 --> 03:50.453
You can destroy him tomorrow.

03:50.455 --> 03:51.721
Thank you, Winston.
You know what?

03:51.723 --> 03:53.690
Next
take-your-daughter-to-work-day

03:53.692 --> 03:56.159
is gonna be take-Winston-out-
for-spaghetti day.

03:56.161 --> 03:58.461
I would enjoy that.

03:58.463 --> 04:00.297
I would enjoy that for real.

04:00.299 --> 04:01.498
(knocking)

04:01.500 --> 04:03.667
Ooh, it's my daddy!

04:03.669 --> 04:05.402
It's my daddy!

04:05.404 --> 04:07.003
Gobble, gobble.

04:07.005 --> 04:09.906
Happy Thanksgiving, son.

04:09.908 --> 04:11.808
I hope you're ready, 'cause I
have a full day planned for us.

04:11.810 --> 04:13.710
First up is a game
of American football

04:13.712 --> 04:15.579
featuring the
Cowboys of Dallas.

04:15.581 --> 04:17.681
(crying)

04:17.683 --> 04:19.916
I'm sorry.

04:19.918 --> 04:21.885
It's our first
Thanksgiving together.

04:21.887 --> 04:23.920
Look, I've been crying
all morning, too.

04:23.922 --> 04:25.689
It's... This is a good thing.

04:25.691 --> 04:28.658
Ann Kim broke up with me.

04:28.660 --> 04:29.693
Oh, no.

04:29.695 --> 04:31.394
Excuse me.

04:31.396 --> 04:32.662
Da...

04:32.664 --> 04:33.697
JESS:
Gavin!

04:33.699 --> 04:35.699
Happy Thanksgiving.

04:35.700 --> 04:37.700
NICK: Hey, Gavin.
It just got a whole lot happier.

04:37.703 --> 04:39.302
Excuse me.

04:40.672 --> 04:42.239
Daddy?

04:42.241 --> 04:45.242
You remember when you
tongue-kissed that guy?

04:49.715 --> 04:52.215
MAN (on TV):
Now this marching band has
traveled 1,500 miles...

04:52.217 --> 04:54.084
What you taking?
Little boy blues?

04:54.086 --> 04:55.885
Yeah, I've been there.

04:55.887 --> 04:57.053
How many miggies
you working with?

04:57.055 --> 04:58.922
Yeah, my pharmacist
bumped me up to nine.

04:58.924 --> 05:02.692
1,400. Yeah.
I have to take 18 pills an hour

05:02.694 --> 05:04.961
in a very specific order,
and they virtually assured me

05:04.963 --> 05:06.796
that I will be
addicted to them.

05:06.798 --> 05:09.766
Hey.
Hey.

05:09.768 --> 05:11.468
Hey, what happened
to Rick Snip?

05:11.470 --> 05:14.204
Uh, gone and, uh...
(sniffles, sighs)

05:14.206 --> 05:16.106
...these tears-- honestly,
they're from the onions.

05:16.108 --> 05:17.741
They're not from Reagan bailing.

05:17.743 --> 05:19.943
Oh, no.
Reagan's not coming?

05:19.945 --> 05:22.712
No. She just called. Uh,
her boss sent her to Omaha,

05:22.714 --> 05:24.547
so she can't make
it, but it's fine.

05:24.549 --> 05:26.950
Oh, I'm sorry, Nick.

05:26.952 --> 05:29.452
I also wear a slow-release
opium patch on my spine.

05:29.454 --> 05:31.087
(laughs)

05:31.089 --> 05:32.555
Hey, I ever told you the story

05:32.557 --> 05:33.923
of how I got injured
in the first place?
Yes.

05:33.925 --> 05:35.725
One may<i> think</i> that it started

05:35.727 --> 05:38.561
because of a lack
of bagels, but no.

05:38.563 --> 05:41.164
It started with a surplus of

05:41.166 --> 05:42.565
cream cheese.
Of cream cheese.

05:42.567 --> 05:44.768
Yes, yes, you're familiar
with such happening.

05:44.770 --> 05:46.970
You know what? I think
Jess told me to help her...
No, no, no, no. You're good.

05:46.972 --> 05:49.172
Uh, lock you up.
(laughs)

05:49.174 --> 05:50.774
I'm sure she's bummed, too.

05:50.776 --> 05:51.675
How long is she gonna be there?

05:51.677 --> 05:53.310
No idea. I didn't ask.

05:53.312 --> 05:54.844
I just said,
"Happy Thanksgiving."

05:58.150 --> 06:00.684
(sizzling)

06:00.686 --> 06:03.086
(whooshing)

06:04.022 --> 06:05.488
And then I hung up.

06:05.490 --> 06:07.090
Okay, you're gonna have
to leave the kitchen.

06:07.092 --> 06:08.758
The whole sad-guy, whiskey,
flame combination

06:08.760 --> 06:11.094
is starting to worry me.
Let me know when

06:11.096 --> 06:13.763
my whiskey boils down to
a crystal so I can eat it.

06:15.834 --> 06:18.201
Hey, Dad,
are you okay in there?

06:18.203 --> 06:19.636
Did you fall in?

06:19.638 --> 06:21.037
That's a dad joke
that I would've assumed

06:21.039 --> 06:23.173
I would have heard you make
had you been around more.

06:23.175 --> 06:25.442
GAVIN:
I want you to know I'm
not using the bathroom.

06:25.444 --> 06:26.776
I'm just sitting here.

06:26.778 --> 06:29.779
Hey, Dad, you know what's
a great cure for heartache?

06:29.781 --> 06:31.514
A little father-and-son time.

06:31.516 --> 06:35.018
You know, we could have
a catch, whittle a stick.

06:35.020 --> 06:37.220
Why don't you just
come out?
(door squeaks open)

06:37.222 --> 06:39.856
I'm sorry, son.
You're right.

06:39.858 --> 06:41.791
Today is about family.

06:41.793 --> 06:42.992
Yeah.
Yeah. Exactly.

06:42.994 --> 06:44.794
There's my favorite
whiskey glass.

06:44.796 --> 06:47.364
Aah. Who wants to get wasted?

06:47.366 --> 06:49.232
Me. so badly.

06:49.234 --> 06:51.234
Ugh. I'm so sorry, babe.

06:51.236 --> 06:52.802
Yeah. No. I'm-I'm fine.

06:52.804 --> 06:56.306
Look, we don't wear sweaters
and roll around in the leaves,

06:56.308 --> 06:57.907
but there are other ways
for us to bond.

06:57.909 --> 07:00.977
If he wants to drink, then,
you know what? I'm gonna drink.

07:00.979 --> 07:03.580
I'm gonna get sloppy
with my poppy.

07:03.582 --> 07:05.815
Nick. Papa!
Wait for me.

07:05.817 --> 07:07.684
Just need to
get my bitters kit.

07:07.686 --> 07:09.252
Ooh, actually,
can you just make sure

07:09.254 --> 07:10.820
that there's a garbage can
next to the bed?

07:10.822 --> 07:14.324
Because... I can't hang.

07:14.326 --> 07:15.925
(television playing nearby)

07:15.927 --> 07:17.527
Robby!

07:17.529 --> 07:19.696
What are you doing here
with me and not with Winston?

07:19.698 --> 07:20.997
I like Winston, but he's been

07:20.999 --> 07:22.699
telling this bagel story
for ten minutes.

07:22.701 --> 07:24.534
I haven't even met
all the main characters yet.

07:24.536 --> 07:26.102
Plus, I have a little
surprise for you.

07:26.104 --> 07:27.737
To make up for this morning,

07:27.739 --> 07:30.173
the airline gave me
two free tickets

07:30.175 --> 07:32.675
to anywhere
in the contiguous 48 states.

07:32.677 --> 07:34.077
Oh. Ha.

07:34.079 --> 07:35.945
Well, I'd love to, you know,
plan our future,

07:35.947 --> 07:37.847
but we're eating
in under four hours,

07:37.849 --> 07:39.249
and so I have
to put you to work.

07:39.251 --> 07:41.184
Okay, you just, crouton.
Oh.

07:41.186 --> 07:42.752
All right. Keep croutonning.

07:42.754 --> 07:45.622
Okay, I'm not that
close to the table.

07:46.925 --> 07:48.024
(clank)
Darn it.

07:48.026 --> 07:49.759
I was just
in the bathroom

07:49.761 --> 07:52.362
with my husband
and his father.
ROBBY: Nothing but net.

07:52.364 --> 07:54.030
Are you also having
a good Thanksgiving?
Hey, Jess.

07:54.032 --> 07:55.799
Check this out.

07:55.801 --> 07:57.100
Did that go in?

07:57.102 --> 07:59.369
Robby got plane tickets,
Swish.

07:59.371 --> 08:01.137
and he wants to whisk my away,
Nothing but bowl.

08:01.139 --> 08:04.741
once he gets better,
which could be months from now.

08:04.743 --> 08:06.543
Jess, I'm looking up
some hotels right now.

08:06.545 --> 08:07.777
Twin bed's okay, right?

08:08.880 --> 08:10.747
Hammer time?

08:10.749 --> 08:12.782
Hammer time.

08:15.220 --> 08:17.120
Cheers.
Yes, sir.

08:17.122 --> 08:18.755
Ah.

08:18.757 --> 08:19.923
This is the dream.

08:19.925 --> 08:23.827
A boy, his dad, his best
friend sharing a drink.

08:23.829 --> 08:25.795
Don't tell Mom, right?

08:25.797 --> 08:27.430
(laughing):
I'm just kidding.

08:27.432 --> 08:28.765
I know you and Mom haven't
spoken in 30 years,

08:28.767 --> 08:30.233
including my wedding.

08:30.235 --> 08:31.835
You know what's stupid?

08:31.837 --> 08:33.837
There's a part of me
that actually thought

08:33.839 --> 08:35.805
I might have a wedding
with Ann Kim someday.

08:35.807 --> 08:37.841
I don't think that's
stupid at all, Dad.

08:37.843 --> 08:39.442
I think that's beautiful.

08:39.444 --> 08:41.277
You know, you opened up
your heart to Ann Kim

08:41.279 --> 08:42.812
and that's brave.

08:42.814 --> 08:44.681
Maybe she was just scared.
You know women.

08:44.683 --> 08:45.682
They're a mystery.

08:45.684 --> 08:47.083
Yeah, sometimes
they just go to Omaha

08:47.085 --> 08:48.518
and you don't know when
they're gonna come back.

08:48.520 --> 08:49.686
Or if they're coming back.

08:49.688 --> 08:51.521
How do you even know
she's in Omaha?

08:51.523 --> 08:53.556
Oh, because, uh,
she said she was.

08:54.793 --> 08:56.826
Nothing means anything.

08:56.828 --> 08:58.294
Nothing means anything.

08:58.296 --> 09:01.197
Nothing... means anything.
At least you're young, Nick.

09:01.199 --> 09:02.298
You got a rocking bod

09:02.300 --> 09:03.867
with kickass buns.

09:03.869 --> 09:05.201
You're not gonna
have any problems.

09:05.203 --> 09:07.704
Who's gonna want
an old guy like me?

09:07.706 --> 09:10.306
I've got garbage buns.

09:10.308 --> 09:12.642
What? Are you out of your mind?
Dad, you've got fantastic buns.

09:12.644 --> 09:14.611
You think?
I'm telling you, you've
got nothing to worry about.

09:14.613 --> 09:16.313
Nick, stand up,
put your buns

09:16.314 --> 09:18.014
next to each
other, so-- here.
What is happening here?

09:18.016 --> 09:19.516
I'm not doing anybody
any favors today.

09:19.518 --> 09:20.717
I'm a bummer.

09:20.719 --> 09:22.118
Probably the best thing
I could do

09:22.120 --> 09:24.020
would be to head home.
See you later, man,
nice to see you again.

09:24.022 --> 09:27.857
Dad, stay. Look, you're
gonna land on your feet.

09:27.859 --> 09:29.993
I've see-- I've seen
all kinds of women

09:29.995 --> 09:31.494
throw themselves at you.

09:31.496 --> 09:34.831
Lifeguards and teachers,
lens crafters.

09:34.833 --> 09:36.299
Remember when you had your
tongue in Jess' mouth?

09:36.301 --> 09:39.369
She tasted like licorice--
sweet but with a bite.

09:39.371 --> 09:40.703
Not-- you're not
helping, Nick.

09:40.705 --> 09:42.305
Actually, you know what? Can I
see you in the hallway, please?

09:42.307 --> 09:43.873
Why?

09:43.875 --> 09:45.408
(groans)

09:49.848 --> 09:51.814
Nick, we have got to
go to Ann Kim's house

09:51.816 --> 09:53.917
and convince her to give
my dad a second chance.

09:53.919 --> 09:55.585
It's the only way
he's gonna stay.

09:55.587 --> 09:56.719
She's not gonna come.
She's a snake.

09:56.721 --> 09:57.854
All women are snakes.

09:57.856 --> 09:59.355
I understand that you're
spinning out about Reagan.

09:59.357 --> 10:01.491
I'm spinning out about Reagan.

10:01.493 --> 10:03.226
I get it. But you
have to help me

10:03.228 --> 10:05.061
save my Thanksgiving
with my dad.

10:05.063 --> 10:06.829
You're right. I'm so sorry.

10:06.831 --> 10:07.897
We can pull this off.

10:07.899 --> 10:09.732
If we get her to
take him back...

10:09.734 --> 10:11.701
Then we'd be heroes.
That's right.

10:11.703 --> 10:13.069
(both laughing)

10:13.071 --> 10:15.705
Look at that, Mom,
I'm gonna be a hero.

10:15.707 --> 10:18.041
Why are you looking up?
Your mother is still alive.

10:18.043 --> 10:19.075
I'm looking at Chicago.

10:19.077 --> 10:20.610
You think Chicago is up?

10:20.612 --> 10:22.211
It's north.

10:22.213 --> 10:24.447
Robby, you're a great guy,

10:24.449 --> 10:27.517
but nothing is ever
gonna happen between us.

10:27.519 --> 10:29.285
However,
someday you're gonna open

10:29.287 --> 10:31.387
a really wonderful
bed and breakfast.

10:31.389 --> 10:32.589
That was pretty good.
I mean, right?

10:32.591 --> 10:33.790
Can you imagine the wine

10:33.792 --> 10:35.091
and cheese hour he would put on?

10:35.093 --> 10:37.860
Stuff the toga with hot coals,
we're going out.
What? Wait.

10:37.862 --> 10:40.730
Have a place setting at
the table for Ann Kim,

10:40.732 --> 10:42.899
but don't seat her
next to my dad.

10:42.901 --> 10:44.901
I want all the
couples split up.

10:44.903 --> 10:46.436
Everybody gets to talk
that way, but, uh...

10:46.438 --> 10:47.971
And then put me
next to Nick.
Yeah.

10:47.973 --> 10:49.539
And then my dad
next to me as well.

10:49.541 --> 10:51.441
So I'm sandwiched
between Nick and my dad.

10:51.443 --> 10:53.142
You guys can't leave.
We need you here.

10:53.144 --> 10:54.377
Well, I need
a happy daddy.

10:54.379 --> 10:55.745
He needs a happy daddy.

10:55.747 --> 10:57.647
If they never come back,
the last words I'll have heard

10:57.649 --> 11:00.483
my husband say are
"happy daddy."

11:00.485 --> 11:02.685
Okay, good luck.

11:05.790 --> 11:08.291
Oh, smells great.

11:08.293 --> 11:10.760
That's just my famous gravy.
(chuckles)

11:10.762 --> 11:13.229
The trick is, um,
a pinch of brown sugar

11:13.231 --> 11:15.498
and then a couple more
handfuls of brown sugar.

11:15.500 --> 11:17.567
Actually, uh, just a
lot of brown sugar.

11:17.569 --> 11:20.570
Ann Kim loves gravy.

11:20.572 --> 11:22.639
Big dogs, small horses,

11:22.641 --> 11:25.241
the smell of rain,
and gasoline.

11:25.243 --> 11:26.676
(sobbing)

11:26.678 --> 11:29.012
Oh, Gavin.

11:29.014 --> 11:31.347
You're a handsome

11:31.349 --> 11:32.915
and passionate

11:32.917 --> 11:34.450
and charismatic man.

11:34.452 --> 11:36.786
You and me.

11:36.788 --> 11:38.287
We really had something.

11:38.289 --> 11:40.089
What do you say we
give it another shot?

11:40.091 --> 11:43.459
Let's just drive
and drive and drive.

11:43.461 --> 11:45.662
I know what I'm not
thankful for this year.

11:45.664 --> 11:48.297
This. This is it.

11:48.299 --> 11:50.299
Robby, this is not
what it looks...
Don't say anything.

11:50.301 --> 11:51.868
I-I don't even know
where to begin,

11:51.870 --> 11:52.835
so I'll just start by saying

11:52.837 --> 11:55.038
that is smells
delicious in here.

11:55.040 --> 11:56.673
I'm gonna leave.

11:56.675 --> 11:58.207
(groans)

11:58.209 --> 12:00.376
Just...

12:02.480 --> 12:03.846
Hold on a second.

12:07.218 --> 12:08.885
(clattering)
(groans)

12:13.224 --> 12:14.691
Hey, Ann Kim,
show your face.

12:14.693 --> 12:16.192
You cold-hearted zombie.

12:16.194 --> 12:17.193
Who's down there?

12:17.195 --> 12:18.661
It's Gavin's son.

12:18.663 --> 12:20.163
I don't know if you
remember this, but we went on

12:20.165 --> 12:21.698
a double date once.
My wife got terribly ill

12:21.700 --> 12:23.299
from some truffle oil.

12:23.301 --> 12:25.034
Rich foods don't
agree with her.

12:25.036 --> 12:26.335
Did Gavin send you?
No, no, no.

12:26.337 --> 12:27.737
He doesn't even know
that I'm here.

12:27.739 --> 12:30.473
Look, Ann Kim,
he's heartbroken.

12:30.475 --> 12:32.709
You opened up something
inside of him,

12:32.711 --> 12:34.544
and you turned him
into the man

12:34.546 --> 12:36.646
that I always knew
that he could be.

12:36.648 --> 12:38.881
And darn it,
I'm just a kid

12:38.883 --> 12:42.185
(sighing):
hoping for
a Thanksgiving miracle.

12:42.187 --> 12:43.686
Why don't you give him
a second chance

12:43.688 --> 12:45.354
and come back with us,

12:45.356 --> 12:48.357
and let's all give
thanks together.

12:48.359 --> 12:50.927
Great speech.

12:50.929 --> 12:53.429
Yeah, it really was
a great speech, man.
Thanks.

12:53.431 --> 12:56.065
Did you do it with the five
other women he's dating?

12:56.067 --> 12:57.667
What?

12:57.669 --> 12:59.035
That's why he always
refers to me

12:59.037 --> 13:01.003
by my first and last name,

13:01.005 --> 13:02.905
because he's dating two Anns.

13:04.375 --> 13:06.075
This is worse than
my Reagan thing.

13:06.077 --> 13:07.844
I can't believe
that I spent all day

13:07.846 --> 13:11.047
feeling sorry
for that son of a bitch.

13:11.049 --> 13:13.216
I guess I'm the son of a bitch.

13:13.218 --> 13:14.717
Leave or I'm hitting
the sprinklers.

13:14.719 --> 13:17.754
Ann Kim, please, give me
a minute to process this.

13:17.756 --> 13:19.789
Sprinklers!
That was not a minute!

13:19.791 --> 13:21.390
Sprinklers!
That was not a minute!

13:21.392 --> 13:22.725
No!

13:22.727 --> 13:23.926
(knocking on door)

13:25.130 --> 13:26.696
Hello, Jessica.

13:26.698 --> 13:30.199
If you're here to hurt Robby,
then you're here to hurt me.

13:30.201 --> 13:31.801
And if you hurt me,

13:31.803 --> 13:33.436
then I'm gonna hurt Robby.

13:33.438 --> 13:34.704
Wait a minute. No.
If you're here...

13:34.706 --> 13:37.306
If you don't get
out of your room,

13:37.308 --> 13:39.275
I'm gonna bleach all
your bird shirts.

13:39.277 --> 13:41.410
Robby, I got to go.

13:41.412 --> 13:42.879
That's a wise choice.

13:42.881 --> 13:44.881
(sighs)

13:45.917 --> 13:49.252
Robby, I need you to know
that there is...

13:49.254 --> 13:52.789
(exhales)
nothing going on
between me and Gavin,

13:52.791 --> 13:53.923
except for an

13:53.925 --> 13:55.925
icy awkwardness
that will continue

13:55.927 --> 13:58.227
until one or both
of us is dead.

13:58.229 --> 14:00.830
Oh, thank God.
(laughs)

14:00.832 --> 14:03.599
I mean, I was sitting
here thinking, really?

14:03.601 --> 14:04.967
Schmidt's dad.

14:04.969 --> 14:06.903
I know. That'd be crazy, right?
Although I totally get it.

14:06.905 --> 14:09.305
I mean... (exhales)
he's got that rakish charm.

14:09.307 --> 14:11.340
And that voice. Oh, my God.

14:11.342 --> 14:13.676
Great buns and...
Robby, stop. There's more.

14:13.678 --> 14:16.779
Oh, boy.

14:16.781 --> 14:18.214
I think I know
where this is going.

14:19.083 --> 14:20.483
Let me guess.

14:20.485 --> 14:23.519
You see me as more of a friend.

14:23.521 --> 14:26.289
Well, I didn't want to talk
about it on Thanksgiving.

14:26.291 --> 14:29.292
But you brought the tickets
and...

14:29.294 --> 14:30.860
Jess, it's okay.
I get it, you know?

14:30.862 --> 14:32.495
There has to be that, um...

14:32.497 --> 14:33.529
Oomph?

14:33.531 --> 14:35.031
Yeah. I was gonna say "yowza,"

14:35.033 --> 14:39.001
but, uh, oomph. You can't
force the oomph, you know?

14:39.003 --> 14:42.104
I'll take my mom to Phoenix.
She's nuts about Phoenix.

14:46.144 --> 14:47.810
SCHMIDT:
Well, congrats, Dad!

14:47.812 --> 14:50.680
Holiday's over!
You ruined another Thanksgiving!

14:50.682 --> 14:52.715
I can't believe
that you're seeing<i> six</i> women.

14:52.717 --> 14:53.883
What's going on?

14:53.885 --> 14:55.284
How do you run a vineyard?

14:55.286 --> 14:57.053
Not well. I'm seeing six women.

14:57.055 --> 14:58.054
He tried to make it seven.

14:58.056 --> 14:59.889
I caught him making
a move on Jess.

14:59.891 --> 15:02.692
Again?
Why is my father so sexual?

15:02.694 --> 15:04.827
Why is he asking
Chicago?
Good question.

15:04.829 --> 15:05.828
You know what, Gavin,
if this is who you really are,

15:05.830 --> 15:07.663
then you can forget
about Thanksgiving

15:07.665 --> 15:09.365
and all the holidays
and all the non-holidays.

15:09.367 --> 15:11.567
Pretty much what I'm talking
about is every day.

15:11.569 --> 15:12.835
Hey, hey, hey, guys,

15:12.837 --> 15:14.203
let's remember the
reason for the season.

15:14.205 --> 15:15.204
We're all
very thankful.

15:15.206 --> 15:16.138
GAVIN:
Jess,

15:16.140 --> 15:17.356
I am so sorry.

15:17.357 --> 15:18.573
I had no idea you
two were together.

15:18.576 --> 15:20.109
I thought you were his
physical therapist.

15:20.912 --> 15:22.295
Physical therapist?

15:22.296 --> 15:23.679
Aren't you a physical
therapist or something?

15:23.681 --> 15:27.283
You think she's a... Jess is
a top-notch vice principal.

15:28.052 --> 15:29.685
(grunts)

15:29.687 --> 15:31.821
JESS:
Oh, Robby...

15:31.823 --> 15:33.756
Robby, no.
Don't stand.

15:33.758 --> 15:35.691
Your-your knee.
I don't give

15:35.693 --> 15:37.493
a flying care about that.

15:37.495 --> 15:39.562
I stand up
when I stand up for people.

15:39.564 --> 15:40.863
I think you're
getting roid rage.

15:40.865 --> 15:41.998
I didn't take any steroids
today,

15:42.000 --> 15:43.900
because the TSA took 'em
this morning.

15:43.902 --> 15:47.403
Now, what you're seeing
is pure, unfiltered Robby,

15:47.405 --> 15:48.804
straight from the tap.

15:49.874 --> 15:51.841
Get him, Robby.
You-you tried
to make Jess

15:51.843 --> 15:53.075
the seventh woman you're dating,

15:53.077 --> 15:54.777
and you don't even know
the first thing about her.

15:54.779 --> 15:56.679
I mean, did-did you know
that when she was six

15:56.681 --> 15:57.847
she tried to eat a lightning bug

15:57.849 --> 15:59.782
so that her heart would glow
like E.T.?

15:59.784 --> 16:02.118
Did you know that she tried
to give herself

16:02.120 --> 16:05.187
Lyme disease out of solidarity
to her fourth grade classmate?

16:05.189 --> 16:09.191
Or-or that she never lets any
of her electronics go below 25%,

16:09.193 --> 16:12.428
just in case someone else
needs to use them? I mean,

16:12.430 --> 16:13.262
did you know...

16:13.264 --> 16:14.697
did you know
that she's terrified

16:14.699 --> 16:15.531
of the large bubbles

16:15.533 --> 16:17.566
in the bubble wrap

16:17.568 --> 16:18.901
but she loves the
little tiny ones?

16:18.903 --> 16:20.903
It's so cute, man.

16:20.905 --> 16:22.571
It would be one thing
if you actually

16:22.573 --> 16:25.041
had feelings for Jess... I'm...
Oh!

16:25.043 --> 16:25.875
I'm...
Whoa.
Whoa,

16:25.877 --> 16:26.876
whoa, whoa.
Oh.

16:26.878 --> 16:29.045
Thank you. But you don't.

16:29.047 --> 16:30.046
Y-You're
just desperate

16:30.048 --> 16:31.447
and lonely and you're trying

16:31.449 --> 16:32.715
to use her, and I...

16:32.717 --> 16:34.116
Oh, it's happening again.
Oh.

16:34.118 --> 16:34.951
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Whoa, Robby!

16:34.953 --> 16:36.085
Oh, oh.

16:36.087 --> 16:36.986
Thank you.

16:37.755 --> 16:38.921
You can't use Jess,

16:38.923 --> 16:40.990
because she is a dream girl.

16:43.294 --> 16:44.493
Here's the last thing I'll say

16:44.495 --> 16:45.995
before I leave.

16:45.997 --> 16:48.764
Jess, I know
it's not me, but...

16:48.766 --> 16:50.132
(sighs)

16:50.134 --> 16:53.970
...you deserve somebody
who knows how special you are.

16:55.673 --> 16:57.740
Um, I'm going. I'm going.

16:57.742 --> 16:58.841
Don't go, Robby.

16:58.843 --> 17:00.409
I'm not going out.
I'm-I'm going down!

17:00.411 --> 17:02.445
(gasping, shouting)

17:02.447 --> 17:04.613
Robby, no!
Turkey! Turkey's down!

17:04.615 --> 17:05.648
Robby! Robby!
Turkey's down!

17:05.650 --> 17:08.150
SCHMIDT: Oh, God!
Relax!
(grunting)

17:08.152 --> 17:09.785
CECE: Just... Okay.
It still looks good!
The turkey

17:09.787 --> 17:11.354
still looks good.
(screaming)
(sizzling)

17:11.356 --> 17:13.956
Wait, what are you...
It is hot! My skin!

17:13.958 --> 17:15.591
It's burning my skin!
The hell you doing?!

17:15.593 --> 17:17.059
It was hot! It was hot!

17:17.060 --> 17:18.526
Now I got to eat
a dirty turkey!
What's wrong with you?

17:18.529 --> 17:19.929
GAVIN:
This is all my fault.

17:19.931 --> 17:20.763
You know I throw hot things!
I'm so sorry.

17:20.765 --> 17:21.931
It was fine!
Turkey's

17:21.933 --> 17:22.965
expensive!
Any more?

17:22.967 --> 17:23.833
This isn't on me!
Furguson

17:23.835 --> 17:25.267
don't eat turkey
from the ground!

17:25.269 --> 17:26.936
NICK: Oh, no. I'm not taking
the fall for this one.

17:26.938 --> 17:28.838
It's all on you!
I'm not taking the...

17:28.840 --> 17:31.607
Hey! Can we not yell
at each other on Thanksgiving?!

17:32.543 --> 17:35.511
I recognize
that I, too, am yelling.

17:35.513 --> 17:37.446
And I'm-I'm sorry, Robby.

17:37.448 --> 17:39.015
Wait.

17:39.017 --> 17:41.684
(elevator doors shut)
(sighs)

17:42.453 --> 17:44.387
Great, he's gone.

17:45.790 --> 17:47.790
(sighs)
I was just starting to feel it.

17:47.792 --> 17:48.724
Go.
Yeah,

17:48.726 --> 17:49.625
Jess, go.

17:49.627 --> 17:50.960
Go.
Go!

17:50.962 --> 17:52.428
Go after him.
Save us some floor turkey.

17:59.137 --> 18:01.670
Hey. Look,

18:01.672 --> 18:04.206
I know you had high hopes
for Thanksgiving with your dad.

18:04.208 --> 18:05.541
You called it.

18:05.543 --> 18:07.076
The guy is who he is.

18:07.078 --> 18:08.744
You know, maybe you
just need to drop this idea

18:08.746 --> 18:10.780
that he'll ever be
the bigger man.

18:11.849 --> 18:13.582
I think that needs
to be you, babe.

18:13.584 --> 18:15.117
You're the bigger man.

18:18.222 --> 18:21.223
Son, I know
you're probably tired

18:21.225 --> 18:22.825
of hearing both these statements

18:22.827 --> 18:24.994
and not likely to believe
either, but...

18:24.996 --> 18:27.663
I'm leaving and I'm sorry.

18:31.702 --> 18:34.637
Dad, I said... I said
a lot of things earlier.

18:36.841 --> 18:40.476
I don't want you out of my life.

18:42.346 --> 18:44.346
I was waiting for you to be
someone who you're not,

18:44.348 --> 18:46.682
but...

18:46.684 --> 18:49.251
I know who you are
and I still love you.

18:50.254 --> 18:52.455
But you-you need to listen
to me,

18:52.457 --> 18:55.091
son to father,
get a therapist.

18:55.093 --> 18:56.892
Oh, I have a therapist.
A better one.

18:56.894 --> 18:59.295
Okay.
And I shouldn't have

18:59.297 --> 19:01.630
to say this but one
that you're not sleeping with.

19:04.569 --> 19:06.902
Okay.

19:06.904 --> 19:10.139
Wait! Robby!
Robby, don't go.

19:10.141 --> 19:12.741
I tried to Irish good-bye, but,
uh, I'm moving a little slow.

19:12.743 --> 19:15.878
When you were in there and you
were saying all those things,

19:15.880 --> 19:18.114
I realize I don't
even really know you.

19:18.116 --> 19:20.116
And I want to get to know you.

19:20.118 --> 19:21.984
Jess, it's okay. I-I don't want
you to force something

19:21.986 --> 19:22.985
that's not there.

19:22.987 --> 19:24.887
I felt it.

19:28.126 --> 19:29.391
You felt the oomph?

19:29.393 --> 19:31.160
Yes. I...
(sighs)

19:31.162 --> 19:32.428
I'm sorry
I'm being

19:32.430 --> 19:33.596
so confusing.

19:33.598 --> 19:35.331
I-I think
I'm as bad at Thanksgiving

19:35.333 --> 19:37.566
as I am at starting
new relationships.

19:37.568 --> 19:38.467
Yeah, you're pretty bad.

19:38.469 --> 19:39.468
Robby,

19:39.470 --> 19:43.305
will you go
on another date with me?

19:44.575 --> 19:47.910
¶ Come on, baby,
make it hurt so good. ¶

19:47.912 --> 19:48.978
(chuckles)

19:50.114 --> 19:52.148
Hell yeah, I'll go
on another date with you.

19:52.150 --> 19:53.048
Hmm.

19:54.152 --> 19:56.919
I did already tell my mom
about Phoenix though.

19:56.921 --> 19:59.088
I hope that's okay.
Oh, of course.

19:59.090 --> 20:03.159
I apologize in advance for
the state of our main course.

20:04.095 --> 20:07.630
¶ ¶

20:07.632 --> 20:10.166
Dad, would you like
to do the honors?

20:10.168 --> 20:12.601
I think the man of the house
traditionally does that.

20:12.603 --> 20:13.702
¶ I am a house ¶

20:13.704 --> 20:14.603
Aw.

20:14.605 --> 20:16.505
¶ Out of twigs and stones ¶

20:16.507 --> 20:18.007
I'm the m... I'm
the man of the house.

20:18.009 --> 20:19.608
Would you look
at that?

20:19.610 --> 20:20.943
(phone buzzes, chimes)
Oh, it's Reagan.

20:20.945 --> 20:23.279
Oh, whoa. You know, I've
always wanted to do this.

20:23.281 --> 20:24.847
Uh, read out loud.

20:24.849 --> 20:27.516
FEMALE VOICE:
In Omaha. Heart emoji.

20:27.518 --> 20:29.618
Smiling pile of poo emoji.

20:29.620 --> 20:33.322
I want my tongue emoji
on your monkey emoji.

20:33.324 --> 20:35.324
Eh, come on, that's a little
private. S-Sorry about that.

20:35.326 --> 20:36.792
She wants to tongue your monkey?

20:36.794 --> 20:37.893
What's your monkey?

20:37.895 --> 20:38.794
Smiling pile of poo?

20:38.796 --> 20:39.795
JESS:
Oh, my God,

20:39.797 --> 20:42.064
Schmidt and Cece
will be in a new home

20:42.066 --> 20:43.499
next year.
Next year
it's at our place.

20:43.501 --> 20:46.101
Happy last loft Thanksgiving,
everyone.

20:47.538 --> 20:48.804
¶ Give and give ¶

20:48.806 --> 20:49.972
They weren't always perfect,

20:49.974 --> 20:51.907
but they were memorable.

20:51.909 --> 20:53.142
Cheers.
Cheers.
Cheers.

20:53.144 --> 20:53.976
Hey. (whoops)
Hey.

20:53.978 --> 20:55.077
CECE: Mmm. Remember

20:55.079 --> 20:56.378
when you fell
down that hole?

20:56.380 --> 20:57.379
Oh, and Schmidt
cooked the meal

20:57.381 --> 20:58.814
in our dead
neighbor's kitchen.

20:58.816 --> 20:59.748
(laughing):
Ms. Beverly.

20:59.750 --> 21:00.716
Mmm!

21:00.718 --> 21:02.418
Remember when we had sex
with strangers?

21:02.420 --> 21:03.552
JESS: That's a
misrepresentation

21:03.554 --> 21:04.920
of what happened.

21:04.922 --> 21:06.922
Remember when your parents
made it in the bathroom?

21:06.924 --> 21:09.925
Or last Thanksgiving, when
we all accidentally took peyote

21:09.927 --> 21:12.027
and, Winston, you wouldn't
let us break the wishbone.

21:12.029 --> 21:14.697
Break the bone, lose the wish.
That's not true!

21:14.699 --> 21:16.999
That's not how it works.
That is not how it works.
