00:01.401 --> 00:02.769
<i>Previously, on "Being Mary Jane..."</i>

00:02.836 --> 00:05.905
Congratulations on the win.
The interview was flawless.

00:05.972 --> 00:09.642
Your victory motivated me
to stop futzing around with my contract.

00:09.709 --> 00:12.345
My agent and I had to leave
a little money on the table,

00:12.412 --> 00:15.248
but what's a few dollars
against the security

00:15.315 --> 00:16.616
of a five-year contract?

00:16.916 --> 00:18.218
So it's done?

00:18.284 --> 00:20.453
What if I decided not to move on?

00:22.055 --> 00:23.590
What if we tried to be...

00:23.656 --> 00:26.393
- Monogamous?
- I couldn't hit a changeup before too.

00:26.459 --> 00:28.595
Karen and I
want to have a child together.

00:28.661 --> 00:30.163
Will you be the sperm donor?

00:35.635 --> 00:37.937
- This is a first.
- What is?

00:38.671 --> 00:41.241
You haven't cracked a joke
since we left the restaurant.

00:42.108 --> 00:45.812
I'm still trying to process
the enormity of Zoe's request.

00:46.546 --> 00:47.547
Her request?

00:47.981 --> 00:48.948
Lee...

00:50.683 --> 00:53.019
A request is "Hand me the remote"
or "Pass the salt".

00:53.086 --> 00:54.954
That wasn't a request.

00:55.021 --> 00:56.723
How would you categorize it?

00:56.790 --> 01:00.393
Your baby mama,
who cheated on you with a man,

01:00.460 --> 01:04.264
wants your sperm to conceive
a love child with her lesbian lover.

01:05.432 --> 01:06.800
That defies categorization.

01:07.834 --> 01:08.802
Yeah.

01:10.303 --> 01:12.839
I could always expect the unexpected
with Zoe.

01:16.209 --> 01:17.210
Man...

01:19.579 --> 01:21.981
She's gonna have this baby
with or without me.

01:22.949 --> 01:23.917
That bothers you?

01:24.717 --> 01:26.519
My kids, particularly Katherine,

01:27.187 --> 01:29.456
they've been begging
for a sibling for years.

01:32.392 --> 01:33.426
We...

01:34.661 --> 01:36.963
We were talking about trying
for another one

01:38.431 --> 01:39.499
when Zoe cheated,

01:40.633 --> 01:42.302
and now after all these years,

01:42.769 --> 01:44.938
my kids finally get what they wanted,

01:45.004 --> 01:46.773
and the only way I can be a part of it

01:48.041 --> 01:49.075
is if I say yes.

01:50.743 --> 01:53.213
So you feel left out?

01:53.680 --> 01:56.382
I know if I say yes,
you'll have a strong opinion about it.

01:58.084 --> 01:59.919
I wasn't expecting that reaction.

02:01.988 --> 02:03.022
Me neither.

02:08.027 --> 02:10.830
I just got to go
and clear my head for a minute.

02:12.298 --> 02:13.266
It's okay.

02:18.505 --> 02:19.472
It's okay.

02:35.922 --> 02:36.956
Kara?

02:38.992 --> 02:40.360
God, are you kidding me?

02:41.895 --> 02:42.896
Orlando?

02:43.730 --> 02:45.965
Orlando? What are you doing?

02:46.866 --> 02:48.935
I have to get up in a few hours for work.

02:49.002 --> 02:50.937
Baby, you are so amazing.

02:51.504 --> 02:55.375
You came here in the middle of the night
to tell me that?

02:55.808 --> 02:56.876
No, no, baby.

02:56.943 --> 03:00.179
I've been out on the town
drinking and chatting up the ladies,

03:00.246 --> 03:02.048
- but here I am.
- Here you are.

03:03.416 --> 03:04.851
We're in a relationship.

03:06.119 --> 03:08.922
- I'm being monogamous.
- What? Oh, God, all right.

03:08.988 --> 03:11.591
I feel like I hit
the game-winning home run.

03:11.658 --> 03:14.327
- Not tonight, not tonight.
- He rounds first.

03:14.394 --> 03:16.763
Orlando, you need to go home. My God!

03:16.829 --> 03:20.700
- Listen to me, crazy boy!
- And the crowd goes wild. We want Lagos!

03:20.767 --> 03:23.069
It's only been a few days.
Don't hurt your shoulder

03:23.136 --> 03:27.073
- patting yourself on the back, okay?
- A few days is a long time for me.

03:27.840 --> 03:29.976
Yes, it is, baby. Let's get you to bed.

03:31.578 --> 03:32.612
My God.

03:41.254 --> 03:43.122
Hey, are you ready for the meeting?

03:43.556 --> 03:46.426
- Late night?
- My God, you have no idea.

03:46.960 --> 03:48.094
I have something for you.

03:49.562 --> 03:52.599
Also, you didn't tell me,
is Lee gonna do it or what?

03:52.665 --> 03:54.033
- Give Zoe his sperm?
- Yeah.

03:54.500 --> 03:57.470
You know,
he's so reasonable he just might.

03:57.770 --> 03:58.972
And how do you feel?

03:59.372 --> 04:00.540
Honestly, I'm annoyed.

04:01.307 --> 04:04.510
I decide to have the family talk with him
and this happens.

04:04.577 --> 04:07.513
You could still have the talk.
He's such a reasonable guy.

04:08.014 --> 04:11.184
Everything is great at work.
I want the rest of my life in order too.

04:11.818 --> 04:14.520
It's not just about getting your life
in order.

04:14.587 --> 04:17.223
- It's about your future with Lee.
- I know.

04:17.290 --> 04:21.060
I finally find a guy
that's capable of loving me. I'm aware.

04:21.327 --> 04:24.931
That's huge, okay? I want to make sure
that your head is straight.

04:24.998 --> 04:26.132
- It is!
- Okay.

04:26.432 --> 04:27.667
- Don't worry.
- All right.

04:28.401 --> 04:30.770
Hey, Justin, the self-driving car?
It's a go.

04:31.104 --> 04:33.606
- We'll have it on air tomorrow.
- I got a better idea.

04:34.140 --> 04:36.476
- Tell me what it is then.
- No, follow my lead.

04:37.076 --> 04:40.380
<i>Last week, "Great Day USA"
correspondent Mary Jane Paul</i>

04:40.446 --> 04:44.684
<i>broke an incredible story exposing
Supreme Court nominee Perry McAlister's</i>

04:44.751 --> 04:48.187
<i>racial bias during his years
as a prosecutor.</i>

04:48.254 --> 04:50.757
<i>Paul's brilliant work
as a journalist stopped</i>

04:50.823 --> 04:54.093
<i>McAlister's inevitable march
to the nation's highest court.</i>

04:54.427 --> 04:55.561
Yes!

04:56.396 --> 04:57.563
Well done, Mary Jane.

04:57.630 --> 05:00.533
If that story doesn't get you a Peabody,
nothing will.

05:00.600 --> 05:02.902
Just call her Woodward and Bernstein
from now on.

05:02.969 --> 05:05.638
No, it was Justin's source.
He deserves the credit.

05:06.105 --> 05:07.473
I just have one question.

05:07.807 --> 05:08.875
What comes next?

05:09.809 --> 05:12.045
My next story idea is, well...

05:12.111 --> 05:16.249
It's so good I'm gonna let
my producer, Justin, pitch it.

05:18.084 --> 05:21.954
What we want to do is a follow-up
to the internet bullying story

05:22.021 --> 05:24.290
that we did last year on Liz Turnow.

05:24.357 --> 05:27.627
It's an important social issue
that continues to be a problem,

05:27.927 --> 05:29.962
not only in schools but, as we showed,

05:30.029 --> 05:31.497
in the workplace as well.

05:32.065 --> 05:33.332
Remind me of the details.

05:33.700 --> 05:36.302
Liz Turnow lived in Silicon Valley...

05:36.369 --> 05:40.473
And her personal texts were hacked
and emailed to an online gossip site.

05:40.807 --> 05:43.743
She lost her job
and any semblance of a normal life.

05:43.810 --> 05:46.345
I did the Liz Turnow segment last year.

05:46.412 --> 05:50.083
And I personally flew to San Jose
to convince her to tell her story.

05:50.516 --> 05:53.786
If you had asked me about Liz,
you would know we keep in contact.

05:55.288 --> 05:59.058
What we want to do is a profile
on where she is now, one year later.

05:59.492 --> 06:00.526
What do you think?

06:04.430 --> 06:05.565
Are you asking me?

06:05.631 --> 06:06.666
No, Kara.

06:09.769 --> 06:13.473
Well, considering the political climate
right now

06:13.539 --> 06:15.942
and the impact that social media's had

06:16.008 --> 06:17.877
on the presidential election,

06:17.944 --> 06:20.246
I think that it's all very relevant.

06:20.313 --> 06:21.914
Didn't Liz leave the country?

06:21.981 --> 06:24.784
Yes, she has rebuilt her life
in the Virgin Islands,

06:24.851 --> 06:27.754
so if anyone's going
to interview Liz again,

06:27.820 --> 06:28.788
it will be me.

06:29.322 --> 06:30.823
Got it. This one's Ronda's.

06:30.890 --> 06:32.558
Kara, you'll produce with her.

06:33.226 --> 06:34.227
Okay?

06:44.804 --> 06:46.572
That was your better idea?

06:47.173 --> 06:49.275
A follow-up to an old Ronda story?

06:49.709 --> 06:52.078
I hoped Ronda'd take it, and she did.

06:52.145 --> 06:54.113
What's going on in your brain?

06:54.180 --> 06:56.682
If Ronda goes to the Virgin Islands,
then what?

06:58.017 --> 07:00.453
- Garrett will need a sub to fill in.
- Exactly.

07:00.920 --> 07:02.155
I'll get you in that chair.

07:08.494 --> 07:12.398
Everyone knows you broke
the McAlister story, even the higher-ups.

07:12.465 --> 07:13.866
Come on, ride this wave.

07:13.933 --> 07:16.002
You don't mind me taking the credit?

07:16.068 --> 07:17.470
Maybe I'm just a nice guy.

07:19.505 --> 07:22.175
Look, if you're sitting
in that anchor chair,

07:22.809 --> 07:25.278
I'm the one who got you there.
It's a win-win.

07:25.344 --> 07:28.981
But we all know Ronda just signed
her new five-year contract.

07:29.048 --> 07:31.350
Yes. The next step is for you to fill in.

07:32.185 --> 07:33.319
Garrett loves you.

07:34.187 --> 07:36.956
Show him you can get up there
and shine next to Aaron.

07:37.223 --> 07:39.091
But I'll need Aaron's support.

07:39.926 --> 07:41.694
- Of course.
- There's one problem.

07:42.094 --> 07:45.398
Every correspondent's gonna try
to test drive Ronda's seat.

07:45.665 --> 07:46.632
Yeah.

07:47.200 --> 07:48.301
Can you take them?

07:50.503 --> 07:51.470
I have an idea.

07:55.741 --> 07:56.709
Hey, Kara.

08:03.282 --> 08:05.551
So what's with you and Justin
in the meeting?

08:05.618 --> 08:08.921
When you and Ronda are out of town
on the Liz Turnow segment,

08:09.755 --> 08:11.557
he thinks I should fill in, you know?

08:12.325 --> 08:14.026
Ride the wave of the McAlister story.

08:14.360 --> 08:16.529
I hate to say that I agree with him.

08:18.030 --> 08:19.498
But I'll ask you one question.

08:20.433 --> 08:21.467
What's his angle?

08:22.235 --> 08:25.271
- No angle.
- Suddenly Justin Talbot's a choirboy?

08:25.338 --> 08:26.839
Maybe I got him all wrong.

08:28.140 --> 08:31.577
Come on, Mary Jane,
you are buying his bullshit.

08:32.178 --> 08:34.747
He is exactly
that smooth-talking black man

08:34.814 --> 08:37.216
that you've fallen prey to in the past.

08:37.283 --> 08:39.218
I appreciate you having my back, Kara.

08:39.585 --> 08:40.586
You know I do.

08:40.987 --> 08:42.889
I'm just glad
Justin's no longer an enemy.

08:44.056 --> 08:46.058
Kara, I need you in the control room. Now.

08:47.193 --> 08:49.862
- I'll be right there.
- You should see this too, Mary Jane.

08:58.938 --> 09:00.139
Roll the clip, please.

09:02.808 --> 09:05.177
<i>You think it won't affect your work,
but it does...</i>

09:05.611 --> 09:08.581
<i>You've had your share of problems
with that.</i>

09:08.648 --> 09:11.117
<i>Not so much anymore.
I've been a good boy lately.</i>

09:12.385 --> 09:13.819
<i>What sparked the change?</i>

09:13.886 --> 09:15.488
<i>Some of it's just maturity.</i>

09:15.554 --> 09:17.623
<i>I'm not as young as I was, and...</i>

09:18.357 --> 09:19.859
<i>I'm also in a relationship now.</i>

09:20.293 --> 09:21.794
<i>A monogamous relationship.</i>

09:21.861 --> 09:23.829
<i>You've been linked to some big names.</i>

09:23.896 --> 09:25.731
<i>She's not a celebrity. She's a...</i>

09:27.133 --> 09:28.601
<i>I've said too much.</i>

09:28.668 --> 09:30.536
<i>No, no, come back here.</i>

09:31.170 --> 09:32.471
<i>Tell us who she is.</i>

09:33.639 --> 09:34.874
<i>All I can say is</i>

09:36.742 --> 09:39.011
<i>she's the most gorgeous,
intelligent woman I know.</i>

09:39.812 --> 09:43.516
<i>Well, I do follow you on Instagram,
and I've seen some pictures of you</i>

09:43.582 --> 09:47.253
<i>with a gorgeous, intelligent producer
from the morning news.</i>

09:48.487 --> 09:49.422
<i>Could this be her?</i>

09:50.122 --> 09:51.090
<i>Am I right?</i>

09:51.924 --> 09:53.259
<i>Kara Lynch, right?</i>

09:53.559 --> 09:55.127
<i>Yeah, you got me.</i>

09:56.295 --> 09:58.297
<i>That's my baby, Kara Lynch.</i>

10:02.201 --> 10:05.738
I know you wanted to keep it a secret,
but we all knew it.

10:05.805 --> 10:06.806
- No!
- Yes, Kara.

10:07.239 --> 10:09.608
Come here. I'm so happy for you.

10:11.544 --> 10:13.879
He really seems like such a great guy.

10:16.749 --> 10:17.750
Aaron?

10:18.017 --> 10:19.018
- Hey.
- Hey.

10:19.585 --> 10:22.054
I know you must decide
who'll sit next to you,

10:22.121 --> 10:25.358
and I considered everything
from bribery to baking you a cake

10:25.424 --> 10:27.760
- to get you to choose me.
- Bribery, really?

10:27.827 --> 10:28.794
Yes.

10:30.663 --> 10:31.664
Look.

10:32.198 --> 10:34.967
I could ask for this opportunity
based on merit alone,

10:36.068 --> 10:37.336
but none of that matters.

10:37.603 --> 10:40.406
What matters is who you choose
to sit next to you.

10:40.740 --> 10:44.677
Do you really think viewers
will get excited about Natalie or Sylvia?

10:45.044 --> 10:46.245
Come on.

10:46.312 --> 10:50.716
Or will we get more eyes watching
with a fresher choice like me?

10:51.050 --> 10:52.418
What do you want to show?

10:55.621 --> 10:57.757
I do appreciate your candor, Mary Jane.

10:59.992 --> 11:02.161
- But I have a question.
- Shoot. Anything.

11:02.795 --> 11:04.997
It's 4-1 on goal, five seconds left.

11:05.064 --> 11:06.499
You're down by three points.

11:07.566 --> 11:09.735
Do you kick the field goal
and go for the tie?

11:10.136 --> 11:11.337
Or for the touchdown?

11:13.939 --> 11:16.809
I think what the Seahawks taught us
in that Superbowl,

11:17.943 --> 11:20.713
is you go beast mode,
and run it up for the touchdown.

11:21.047 --> 11:22.048
No hesitation.

11:35.828 --> 11:37.830
Going for the win can be aggressive.

11:37.897 --> 11:39.065
I know it's bold, but...

11:39.131 --> 11:42.068
You've changed.
Aaron might find that threatening.

11:42.334 --> 11:43.335
I'm changed?

11:44.403 --> 11:47.039
You're no longer just reading copy.

11:47.506 --> 11:50.176
When you look in the camera,
you're in the zone.

11:50.242 --> 11:54.080
You're Jordan taking the last shot.
This is Ali versus Frazier now.

11:54.146 --> 11:56.916
That is quite the compliment.

11:58.184 --> 12:01.053
But must everything be a sports analogy
these days?

12:01.120 --> 12:02.321
You started it.

12:02.388 --> 12:04.457
Mary Jane,
would you join me in my office?

12:04.523 --> 12:05.825
- Of course.
- Wonderful.

12:12.998 --> 12:15.301
- Join me for a cup?
- I'm fine, thanks.

12:15.367 --> 12:17.069
No, darling, I insist.

12:17.436 --> 12:20.406
This is imported
from a Kenyan coffee farm

12:20.473 --> 12:22.041
that my foundation sponsors.

12:30.149 --> 12:32.618
- One lump or two?
- Black for me, please.

12:32.685 --> 12:33.686
Dear.

12:34.286 --> 12:36.255
You have to have a little sugar.

12:40.025 --> 12:41.327
It softens the bitterness.

12:49.401 --> 12:50.503
Here you go, dear.

12:57.510 --> 12:59.712
Since the ink has dried on my contract,

12:59.778 --> 13:02.915
there is no reason
to depend on the suits anymore.

13:03.582 --> 13:05.151
We're smarter than that, right?

13:05.518 --> 13:06.485
Absolutely.

13:10.656 --> 13:11.624
This is exquisite.

13:11.891 --> 13:12.992
I knew you'd like it.

13:15.461 --> 13:18.063
You know, one of the privileges
of this job

13:18.130 --> 13:21.834
is being able to whisper
into Aaron's ear about who'll replace me.

13:23.869 --> 13:26.405
He likes to make a big show
of announcing his choice,

13:26.839 --> 13:30.042
and he even uses it to get sexual favors
from time to time.

13:30.509 --> 13:33.379
But really, I tell him who it's gonna be,
and he listens.

13:34.780 --> 13:37.216
Obviously you made sure
I wasn't his choice.

13:38.551 --> 13:39.852
I told him to choose Natalie.

13:41.086 --> 13:42.221
Of course you did.

13:42.288 --> 13:43.522
Believe it or not,

13:45.958 --> 13:48.761
I did it for your own good.

13:50.963 --> 13:52.665
If you really believe that,

13:54.266 --> 13:56.068
you're more out of touch than I thought.

14:02.141 --> 14:03.175
Afternoon.

14:15.221 --> 14:16.422
Natalie, wait up.

14:17.122 --> 14:18.824
Congratulations.

14:18.891 --> 14:21.227
Way to go,
snagging the fill-in anchor spot.

14:21.493 --> 14:24.296
Told you, sleeping with Aaron
was my insurance policy.

14:24.363 --> 14:26.932
My fake orgasm performance
should win me an Oscar.

14:27.199 --> 14:28.601
Shivers and all.

14:28.667 --> 14:30.669
Props to you for thinking ahead, girl.

14:31.770 --> 14:33.072
- But...
- What?

14:34.773 --> 14:35.808
Sylvia?

14:36.909 --> 14:39.044
You know she's the news director's niece, right?

14:41.614 --> 14:43.515
He is such a brown-noser. I knew it.

14:44.083 --> 14:45.517
Maybe they're just friends.

14:46.518 --> 14:48.554
Aaron said he despised
short hair on women.

14:53.726 --> 14:55.361
Mary Jane, look at this.

14:55.661 --> 14:57.329
No, no, you look at this.

14:59.965 --> 15:02.234
Why is Natalie all up in Aaron's face?

15:02.301 --> 15:04.703
She just figured out
Aaron is sleeping with Sylvia.

15:06.438 --> 15:08.807
- She didn't know that?
- Apparently not.

15:08.874 --> 15:12.544
But she is giving Aaron reason
to rethink his choice in co-anchor.

15:13.979 --> 15:16.248
She's gonna have other opportunities. Stop.

15:17.216 --> 15:18.317
God.

15:18.384 --> 15:20.586
- What?
- It's Lee again.

15:20.653 --> 15:23.589
Well, answer it.
Maybe he's decided about Zoe.

15:23.656 --> 15:25.157
That's what I'm afraid of. No.

15:27.092 --> 15:29.461
I'll deal with it later.
Now show me that.

15:29.528 --> 15:31.530
It's much better on the big screen.

15:31.597 --> 15:33.632
You are not gonna believe this shit.

15:36.368 --> 15:37.436
Yeah.

15:37.503 --> 15:39.772
"New York baseball star Orlando Lagos

15:39.838 --> 15:42.908
has put his legendary womanizing days
behind him

15:43.275 --> 15:46.312
for a hot, mature beauty
with brains to go with the looks.

15:46.378 --> 15:48.881
Just days after going public
with his new relationship

15:48.947 --> 15:50.916
with 'Great Day USA' producer Kara Lynch,

15:51.183 --> 15:54.920
the famed second baseman was seen
out and about with his new lady love."

15:56.155 --> 15:57.790
- There's a video!
- Yeah, yeah.

15:57.856 --> 15:59.024
Yeah.

15:59.091 --> 16:00.326
Yeah, look at this.

16:01.960 --> 16:02.995
You look hot.

16:03.696 --> 16:05.064
Can you believe this shit?

16:05.864 --> 16:08.600
Why are you so upset?
You've never looked hotter.

16:08.667 --> 16:11.370
- They called you MILF of the month.
- Great!

16:11.437 --> 16:14.707
Now my name gets added
to an illustrious list of exes,

16:14.773 --> 16:17.109
including singers, sitcom actresses,

16:17.176 --> 16:19.111
and, wait for it, a porn star.

16:19.178 --> 16:21.280
God, he's been around. Get over it.

16:22.181 --> 16:24.350
It's one of the cons
of dating a celebrity.

16:24.416 --> 16:26.685
It's not like
you're some Sunday school virgin.

16:27.219 --> 16:29.655
Wait a minute.
Now I'm supposed to compete

16:29.722 --> 16:32.558
with 20-year-old beanpoles
with boob implants?

16:32.624 --> 16:34.259
Honey, there is no competition.

16:35.327 --> 16:36.729
You won. He wants you.

16:37.696 --> 16:40.632
I don‘t like my business being public.
I don't like it.

16:41.133 --> 16:42.401
Cry me a river.

16:42.468 --> 16:45.070
Do you know how many women
would give their left leg

16:45.137 --> 16:47.339
to have a man like Orlando
publicly claim them?

16:47.740 --> 16:50.175
It's not like you're some ordinary skank

16:50.242 --> 16:53.545
who's got to take secrets selfies
with him while he sleeps.

16:53.612 --> 16:54.646
You're his lady.

16:57.916 --> 16:59.651
Looks like your guided missile just hit.

17:01.987 --> 17:06.024
Did your nasty-ass new producer
put you up to this little skit?

17:06.692 --> 17:08.327
No, it was my idea.

17:08.594 --> 17:10.396
What? Really?

17:10.963 --> 17:14.199
I did the same at SNC with Luke Ryan,
and you didn't mind.

17:14.633 --> 17:17.770
Plant the seed of doubt
and throw them off their game, right?

17:19.037 --> 17:22.574
I thought this Mary Jane
was about doing things differently.

17:22.875 --> 17:25.444
Look, I think
I deserve a little leeway here.

17:25.878 --> 17:28.080
When I took this job,
I was led to believe

17:28.147 --> 17:29.681
that I would fill Ronda's spot.

17:30.115 --> 17:31.216
That hasn't happened.

17:32.050 --> 17:34.253
- I was lied to.
- Okay, just do me a favor.

17:34.319 --> 17:37.256
Don't let Justin's skanky-ass ways
rub off on you.

17:37.322 --> 17:39.324
I can't believe
I'm hearing this from you.

17:40.025 --> 17:41.560
- You're jealous.
- What?

17:41.627 --> 17:43.061
Why would I be jealous?

17:43.128 --> 17:45.697
Because none of our plans are working.

17:45.998 --> 17:47.533
- And Justin's are.
- Whatever.

17:48.834 --> 17:49.902
Thank you.

17:51.136 --> 17:52.905
- Come on.
- What? What's wrong?

17:53.739 --> 17:54.740
Lee's here.

17:56.275 --> 17:57.309
Boy...

18:00.078 --> 18:03.348
- Did you see Aaron storm out?
- Maybe Natalie's out as co-anchor.

18:03.415 --> 18:04.716
It's a strong possibility.

18:05.417 --> 18:08.287
This is exactly why I don't date anyone
in the office.

18:08.353 --> 18:09.721
I'll be prepared.

18:10.823 --> 18:11.890
- Hey.
- Hey.

18:13.025 --> 18:14.960
- Bad time?
- No, no.

18:15.861 --> 18:19.765
Justin, this is my boyfriend, Lee.
Lee, this is my producer, Justin Talbot.

18:19.832 --> 18:22.768
- Nice to meet you. Heard a lot about you.
- Yeah, same.

18:23.836 --> 18:25.037
You work in construction?

18:25.671 --> 18:27.105
No, comedian, but close.

18:29.374 --> 18:31.276
- I'll catch up with you later.
- Okay.

18:32.478 --> 18:33.512
Justin.

18:34.213 --> 18:35.848
- He's not what I imagined.
- No?

18:36.215 --> 18:38.684
No, I thought
he'd be some fire-breathing exec.

18:39.818 --> 18:41.553
I thought you hated each other.

18:41.620 --> 18:43.889
No, I told you I think I won him over.

18:43.956 --> 18:45.991
But you didn't come to talk about him.

18:46.058 --> 18:48.727
- You didn't answer my texts.
- I've been preoccupied.

18:49.728 --> 18:50.929
With work?

18:50.996 --> 18:53.532
With waiting to from Aaron
if I'm subbing for Ronda.

18:54.433 --> 18:57.736
I've been doing that a lot lately,
waiting for men to decide.

18:58.937 --> 19:00.105
I probably deserve that.

19:00.772 --> 19:02.007
So have you decided?

19:04.576 --> 19:05.677
I'll tell Zoe no.

19:07.012 --> 19:08.914
You sure? 'Cause you seemed torn.

19:08.981 --> 19:11.116
No, no, I really wasn't.

19:11.817 --> 19:14.686
Having a baby with her
when I'm with you, that's not okay.

19:14.753 --> 19:17.055
If you knew that,
why did you ask for space?

19:17.890 --> 19:20.192
I needed time to mourn
what could have been,

19:20.259 --> 19:22.895
but now it's time to focus
on what can be, on the future.

19:23.896 --> 19:25.030
I love you, Mary Jane.

19:26.765 --> 19:27.900
I love you too.

19:38.176 --> 19:39.678
I don't want to keep you turning.

19:39.978 --> 19:41.346
But now you know my answer.

19:41.647 --> 19:43.415
Now I'll go and tell Zoe the good news.

19:44.182 --> 19:45.617
- Wish me luck.
- Good luck.

19:51.690 --> 19:54.593
Listen, Max, I know you follow Orlando
on social media,

19:54.660 --> 19:57.029
and I wanted to make sure
everything's okay.

19:57.095 --> 19:59.231
<i>- You're kidding me, right?
- No! I'm not.</i>

19:59.298 --> 20:02.367
And I‘m not trying to baby you.
I just know how kids can be.

20:02.434 --> 20:05.604
<i>You don't need to worry.
I'm getting all kind of props.</i>

20:05.671 --> 20:08.073
<i>All the girls want to talk to me now.</i>

20:08.140 --> 20:09.741
<i>I'm popular all of a sudden.</i>

20:09.808 --> 20:13.645
Listen, I don't want you to think
that all this attention is cool

20:13.712 --> 20:15.047
or anything, okay?

20:15.113 --> 20:17.215
Celebrity has its bad side too.

20:17.282 --> 20:20.252
<i>Orlando made it clear
he doesn't think it's cool either.</i>

20:20.319 --> 20:21.386
He did?

20:21.453 --> 20:24.256
<i>We texted, and he said all that stuff
is superficial.</i>

20:24.323 --> 20:28.794
<i>- It's not what really matters.
- Okay. Did he say what really matters?</i>

20:29.294 --> 20:30.662
<i>Yeah, how you treat people.</i>

20:32.864 --> 20:34.399
Well, get ready for bed.

20:34.466 --> 20:36.635
I'll call when I'm back
from the Virgin Islands.

20:36.702 --> 20:39.137
<i>- It'll be in and out.
- That's what she said.</i>

20:39.204 --> 20:40.339
That's not funny.

20:40.405 --> 20:41.506
<i>I love you, mom.</i>

20:41.573 --> 20:43.308
I love you too, baby. I love you.

20:44.042 --> 20:45.110
Goodnight.

20:47.045 --> 20:49.314
My God, you are too much.

20:51.917 --> 20:52.985
Thank you.

20:55.053 --> 20:57.422
Get that stupid smug look off your face.

20:57.489 --> 20:59.091
You don't like what I said to him?

20:59.358 --> 21:01.827
- No, I like what you said to my son.
- You do.

21:01.893 --> 21:02.861
It was good.

21:03.195 --> 21:04.296
It's not that.

21:04.563 --> 21:07.633
It's a little weird
hearing that my kid's Q-Rating shot up

21:07.699 --> 21:10.102
because his mother's dating
a star athlete.

21:11.103 --> 21:14.272
Well, your Q-Rating
is gonna shoot up too,

21:14.740 --> 21:16.608
- MILF of the week.
- Okay. Stop.

21:16.675 --> 21:19.211
I don't give a damn
about a Q-Rating, Orlando.

21:19.277 --> 21:21.513
I like my private life to be private.

21:22.080 --> 21:24.082
- I mean it.
- I know. I'm sorry.

21:25.717 --> 21:27.219
The attention will subside.

21:28.053 --> 21:31.490
People will get bored and move on
to some other celebrity couple.

21:32.057 --> 21:33.358
- Yeah?
- Promise.

21:40.799 --> 21:42.167
About that quick in and out...

21:46.638 --> 21:47.773
- Kara.
- Yeah?

21:48.106 --> 21:50.108
How are your poker-playing skills?

21:51.610 --> 21:52.944
Great. Why do you ask?

21:53.011 --> 21:55.947
I don't know if you're aware.
I host a monthly poker game.

21:56.014 --> 21:58.283
Yes. I've heard rumors about that.

21:58.350 --> 22:00.152
Would you join us this month?

22:00.218 --> 22:03.021
It's just a few industry friends,
mostly guys.

22:03.088 --> 22:04.823
Mattie Lauer, Brian Williams...

22:04.890 --> 22:06.024
Alec Baldwin?

22:06.391 --> 22:07.859
Not lately.

22:08.527 --> 22:10.495
Then I'm not really interested in...

22:12.330 --> 22:14.966
I'm just kidding.
Of course, I would love that.

22:15.033 --> 22:18.036
- Great. I'll send you over the details.
- Okay. Thanks.

22:19.771 --> 22:20.806
God.

22:21.440 --> 22:22.607
My God.

22:22.674 --> 22:23.709
What was that?

22:25.844 --> 22:29.381
Garrett just invited me
to his monthly poker game.

22:30.215 --> 22:32.951
The secret monthly game
that's so hard to get into?

22:33.452 --> 22:34.419
Yeah.

22:35.020 --> 22:38.457
It's a perk of dating a celebrity athlete
you can get down with.

22:39.624 --> 22:40.659
I'm saying.

22:41.626 --> 22:43.762
Justin, did you catch last night's game?

22:44.229 --> 22:45.630
I knew you'd rub it in.

22:47.566 --> 22:49.301
Well, first order of business.

22:49.367 --> 22:50.869
Aaron has some news. Aaron?

22:51.503 --> 22:54.973
I wanted you to know that I've chosen
our esteemed correspondent

22:55.040 --> 22:57.008
to fill in for Ronda while she's out.

22:59.044 --> 23:00.178
Mary Jane Paul.

23:08.053 --> 23:10.555
Congratulations, Mary Jane.
Good luck in the chair.

23:18.396 --> 23:20.766
If I get to be as big a bitch as Ronda,

23:21.500 --> 23:23.168
- you'll kill me, right?
- Yeah.

23:23.702 --> 23:25.003
But that's not important.

23:25.504 --> 23:28.673
What matters is it's happening.
You'll be in that chair.

23:28.740 --> 23:29.908
Yeah, just for a day.

23:30.475 --> 23:31.610
That's huge!

23:32.444 --> 23:33.612
And...

23:33.678 --> 23:36.648
Your boyfriend is not having a baby
with his ex, so...

23:37.816 --> 23:39.684
That alone is reason to celebrate.

23:39.751 --> 23:41.953
- Absolutely.
- Sad but true.

23:43.889 --> 23:46.558
Now you can talk to him
about you getting his sperm.

23:46.892 --> 23:47.993
I know, right?

23:48.059 --> 23:49.494
But I can't help but think,

23:49.861 --> 23:51.696
what if he says no to my ass too?

23:51.763 --> 23:53.965
Like, "No sperm for any of you bitches!"

23:54.332 --> 23:56.835
Mama, listen to me. No. Listen to me.

23:56.902 --> 23:58.804
If you truly want to have a baby,

23:58.870 --> 24:01.807
you have to have that talk
with him now, Mary Jane.

24:01.873 --> 24:04.075
- Your clock is ticking.
- I know. I know.

24:04.543 --> 24:06.678
Tonight he's with Zoe and the kids.

24:06.945 --> 24:10.549
Then you can stay with me
and finish off this bottle of wine!

24:10.615 --> 24:12.184
- Yes!
- Can I?

24:12.250 --> 24:13.552
What about Orlando?

24:16.254 --> 24:17.355
God, what now?

24:18.490 --> 24:22.294
I just can't seem to shake this feeling
that that boy, he is just...

24:23.061 --> 24:24.129
He's too young.

24:24.996 --> 24:26.798
And he's just way too famous.

24:26.865 --> 24:29.267
Bitch, those aren't problems.
Those are perks.

24:29.801 --> 24:30.836
But how long?

24:31.570 --> 24:34.005
It's not like we are gonna
grow old together,

24:34.072 --> 24:35.707
- so what's the point?
- Kara.

24:36.174 --> 24:38.510
- Can we have a no bullshit conversation?
- Yes.

24:38.977 --> 24:41.680
For weeks, I have listened to you
make excuses about him.

24:42.080 --> 24:44.316
"He's too young. He's too famous.

24:44.382 --> 24:46.718
He's too rich. He's too monogamous."

24:46.785 --> 24:48.820
Next you're gonna say
the sex was too good.

24:49.821 --> 24:51.790
I have created a little monster.

24:52.057 --> 24:55.460
You're the only one reaping the benefits
of his new bedroom skills.

24:55.527 --> 24:56.862
What's the problem?

24:56.928 --> 25:00.632
Sex is not the only thing
that makes a good relationship, okay?

25:00.699 --> 25:02.334
What's the real problem here?

25:03.435 --> 25:05.637
Don't say your kids, they love Orlando.

25:05.704 --> 25:08.073
I don't know. It just doesn't feel right.

25:08.139 --> 25:09.741
I can't explain it.

25:09.808 --> 25:12.744
How much time do I waste with him
before we split up

25:12.811 --> 25:14.846
and he moves on to the next Kardashian

25:14.913 --> 25:17.249
and I watch that shit all over the news?

25:17.315 --> 25:19.117
Like I don't have enough on my plate.

25:19.417 --> 25:20.418
Screw that.

25:21.219 --> 25:24.322
Orlando hasn't done one damn thing
to make you feel this way.

25:25.891 --> 25:28.927
These reasons you're coming up with
are in your head, you know?

25:30.729 --> 25:31.897
That's fire. Pack it.

25:33.765 --> 25:34.799
You're afraid.

25:35.567 --> 25:37.435
- Afraid of what?
- Getting hurt.

25:37.502 --> 25:39.204
- No, I'm not.
- You're afraid. Yes.

25:39.771 --> 25:40.839
You are.

25:41.706 --> 25:45.110
Think of how many times you told me
not to let fear ruin a relationship.

25:45.744 --> 25:47.946
You have a very good thing
going with Orlando.

25:50.148 --> 25:51.650
I don't wanna be played with.

25:52.317 --> 25:56.688
I don't wanna look like some stupid-ass,
ignorant schoolgirl falling in love.

25:56.755 --> 25:58.690
- I don't wanna go...
- Baby.

25:59.024 --> 26:00.859
- I don't want it, you know?
- Baby.

26:03.495 --> 26:04.896
It's too late. You are.

26:12.270 --> 26:15.307
Everyone in the studio
is buzzing about you right now.

26:15.373 --> 26:17.876
I know. It's weird.
Everyone's being so nice.

26:18.176 --> 26:21.279
- Treating me like the star.
- Get used to it, all right?

26:21.613 --> 26:23.848
If you nail this, it's a matter of time.

26:24.149 --> 26:25.450
Let's not push it.

26:25.517 --> 26:29.087
Only you stand between yourself
and that permanent anchor chair.

26:29.788 --> 26:30.789
All right?

26:32.524 --> 26:33.692
It's your opportunity.

26:34.225 --> 26:35.260
Own it.

26:38.330 --> 26:41.266
You are craftier
than I thought, Mary Jane.

26:41.933 --> 26:43.368
Because I got Aaron to choose me?

26:44.369 --> 26:46.237
I tried to save you from yourself.

26:46.738 --> 26:48.106
I don't think so.

26:48.173 --> 26:50.141
He picked me because he thinks I'm ready.

26:50.642 --> 26:51.776
That may be true.

26:52.510 --> 26:54.813
But live television
is an unpredictable thing.

26:55.380 --> 26:58.483
Aaron's choice, the correspondent
that you replaced,

26:58.550 --> 27:00.685
she did so poorly it was her last day.

27:01.486 --> 27:03.355
Surely it's not gonna be your fate,

27:03.421 --> 27:04.889
but with the morning news

27:05.523 --> 27:07.158
you never know what could happen.

27:15.100 --> 27:16.768
Good morning. I'm Mary Jane Paul.

27:17.135 --> 27:19.070
With Saint Patrick's Day so close,

27:19.137 --> 27:22.874
we have got some wonderful ways
for you to celebrate the...

27:25.210 --> 27:26.244
What is it?

27:30.949 --> 27:34.552
Along with tips for this weekend's
upcoming Daylight Savings Time.

27:34.886 --> 27:36.354
How'd you like to lose an hour

27:36.654 --> 27:39.257
without losing an hour
of precious sleep time?

27:39.924 --> 27:42.560
All of these stories
and a whole bunch of others stuff

27:42.627 --> 27:44.729
that I have no idea
what I'm talking about.

27:45.463 --> 27:47.265
Come on, come on, come on.

27:57.609 --> 27:59.010
Hey, I know it's late,

27:59.411 --> 28:02.147
I don't know if it's the excitement
of going on air

28:02.213 --> 28:03.715
or Ronda trying to screw me,

28:03.782 --> 28:06.918
but I'm off my game, and...

28:08.286 --> 28:09.687
Can you come help me?

28:10.055 --> 28:11.056
Please?

28:18.963 --> 28:21.766
Thank you for coming down
to the studio this late.

28:21.833 --> 28:24.602
I am... choking.

28:24.669 --> 28:27.305
Okay, I'm here to help.
It was my idea, remember?

28:28.606 --> 28:29.607
Let's get started.

28:30.175 --> 28:32.110
Good morning. I'm Mary Jane Paul.

28:32.477 --> 28:34.245
With Saint Patrick's Day so close

28:34.312 --> 28:37.248
here are some wonderful ways
to celebrate the occasion.

28:37.315 --> 28:38.416
Right there.

28:40.618 --> 28:41.686
It was a short pause.

28:42.220 --> 28:43.755
You'll move on to a new subject

28:44.055 --> 28:46.224
and, it might feel nitpicky,

28:47.192 --> 28:50.495
but if one breath is too long,
one pause brushed over,

28:50.562 --> 28:52.430
it can affect the entire segment.

28:53.098 --> 28:54.732
So again from there.

28:56.768 --> 28:59.003
And just ahead of Daylight Savings Time,

28:59.070 --> 29:02.841
we'll show you how to lose an hour
without losing valuable sleep time

29:02.907 --> 29:04.742
as we spring forward this Sunday.

29:05.043 --> 29:07.011
These stories and more coming your way,

29:07.078 --> 29:08.246
on "Great Day USA."

29:08.580 --> 29:10.515
Great. Freeze. Very good.

29:10.949 --> 29:13.318
I'm just gonna make
one slight adjustment.

29:19.157 --> 29:20.325
Never let your chin

29:20.859 --> 29:22.327
fall below the camera lens.

29:24.362 --> 29:25.396
Okay?

29:29.134 --> 29:30.201
Go again.

29:33.471 --> 29:36.608
These stories and more coming your way
on "Great Day USA."

29:40.612 --> 29:41.646
Perfect.

29:44.649 --> 29:45.717
You got this.

29:48.920 --> 29:51.055
Go home, get a few hours of sleep.

29:51.890 --> 29:53.091
You got a big day ahead.

30:07.138 --> 30:08.173
Well?

30:08.640 --> 30:09.674
You like?

30:09.974 --> 30:13.211
It's a little different
than what I'm used to, but I like it.

30:20.285 --> 30:22.487
You and Justin seem awfully chummy.

30:23.655 --> 30:25.957
You fell under the spell
of those baby blues?

30:26.024 --> 30:27.992
He's a great producer, Ty, that's all.

30:29.194 --> 30:30.161
Okay.

30:30.962 --> 30:32.030
Aaron!

30:32.664 --> 30:34.098
Mary Jane, how we doing?

30:34.165 --> 30:35.767
- Fantastic.
- Glad to hear it.

30:36.234 --> 30:37.969
- On the floor in five.
- Absolutely.

30:38.937 --> 30:39.971
Jeez.

30:42.740 --> 30:44.242
<i>- Kara.
- You in your office?</i>

30:44.309 --> 30:47.378
<i>- I'm going to the studio.
- Ronda left the hotel this morning.</i>

30:47.679 --> 30:49.581
<i>Early. Didn't say one word to me.</i>

30:49.647 --> 30:51.049
<i>Heard anything from Garrett?</i>

30:51.549 --> 30:52.750
No, why?

30:52.817 --> 30:54.986
<i>I don't know. I got a bad feeling.</i>

30:55.887 --> 30:57.222
That's so not like her.

31:01.159 --> 31:02.860
My God!

31:02.927 --> 31:04.028
<i>What's happening?</i>

31:04.095 --> 31:07.432
That sneaky heifer just walked in
and brought Liz Turnow with her.

31:08.066 --> 31:09.100
Damn it!

31:10.668 --> 31:11.703
Let's just say it.

31:12.837 --> 31:13.905
Bitch is good.

31:15.106 --> 31:17.575
I have to admit
she played this like a master.

31:18.443 --> 31:21.980
After the lowest point in your life,
dealing with harassment,

31:22.046 --> 31:24.983
dealing with the loss of your job,
of your fiancé,

31:25.049 --> 31:26.784
it sounds like things changed.

31:27.185 --> 31:28.253
They have.

31:28.620 --> 31:31.322
But, at the time,
I thought those internet trolls

31:31.389 --> 31:32.790
had destroyed my life.

31:33.124 --> 31:34.559
Then everything changed.

31:34.926 --> 31:36.361
What brought on the change?

31:37.095 --> 31:40.031
It started by coming on
to your show last year.

31:40.598 --> 31:42.834
With the support that I received,

31:42.900 --> 31:46.871
I found my true calling as a yoga
and meditation teacher,

31:47.338 --> 31:49.207
and opened a studio in Saint Thomas.

31:49.474 --> 31:50.742
And thanks to you.

31:51.109 --> 31:52.410
Thank you so much.

31:52.477 --> 31:54.612
Don't worry. There'll be a next time.

31:55.013 --> 31:57.949
<i>And after, what was the reaction after</i>

31:58.016 --> 32:00.218
<i>the first interview that we did?</i>

32:00.285 --> 32:02.353
<i>I was so surprised. I was in a low...</i>

32:05.089 --> 32:06.157
Shit!

32:09.193 --> 32:11.529
A tantrum isn't gonna solve anything.

32:12.397 --> 32:15.533
You gotta go back there
and look Ronda right in her eye...

32:15.600 --> 32:17.869
You can't be serious. You cannot!

32:17.935 --> 32:19.337
Don't give her...

32:19.404 --> 32:21.773
Enough telling me
what to do and how to do it.

32:21.839 --> 32:23.841
- It's over. You failed.
- No.

32:23.908 --> 32:24.909
No! I do not fail.

32:25.243 --> 32:27.912
Okay? I don't fail.
Quitters fail. Cowards fail.

32:27.979 --> 32:30.114
I do not fail. I‘m not gonna start now.

32:31.883 --> 32:33.618
I understand that you are pissed

32:33.685 --> 32:37.155
about all the broken promises,
from Garrett to Ronda to even Kara,

32:37.221 --> 32:38.556
but remember this.

32:38.623 --> 32:41.392
I am the one
that brought you to this point.

32:41.459 --> 32:42.694
Me, not them.

32:42.760 --> 32:44.929
This is a setback, not a failure.

32:47.632 --> 32:49.334
I just wish somebody would say it.

33:00.478 --> 33:01.679
Say what?

33:03.881 --> 33:05.416
It'll never happen for me.

33:05.983 --> 33:08.186
Ronda's too good. I can't beat her.

33:08.252 --> 33:09.587
No. You can.

33:12.023 --> 33:13.057
And you will.

33:16.094 --> 33:17.195
Cause you're better.

33:20.665 --> 33:21.799
Listen to me.

33:23.701 --> 33:24.869
You gotta trust me.

33:27.572 --> 33:29.307
You will be the anchor of this show.

33:56.167 --> 33:58.002
Garrett's probably looking for us.

33:58.069 --> 34:00.671
I'll let them know you're almost ready.

34:02.373 --> 34:03.408
Okay.

35:08.573 --> 35:09.674
I'm a MILF.

35:28.092 --> 35:29.494
I missed you so much, baby.

35:30.061 --> 35:32.864
Orlando, I was only gone for 24 hours.

35:33.531 --> 35:35.166
- Please.
- Very long 24 hours.

35:39.337 --> 35:40.471
What's the matter?

35:42.373 --> 35:45.376
Are you still upset over that website?
Just ignore it.

35:47.278 --> 35:48.579
No, it's not that.

35:50.781 --> 35:53.751
The reason for coming to New York
was to focus on work.

35:53.818 --> 35:56.487
I want to be the first Latina
executive producer

35:56.821 --> 35:59.490
- in morning news history.
- I want that for you too.

36:00.358 --> 36:03.227
But with our relationship
being so open, Orlando,

36:03.628 --> 36:06.464
and your public life,
it's just too much for me.

36:06.531 --> 36:09.066
It's becoming harder and harder
to do this.

36:09.133 --> 36:10.201
How so?

36:10.701 --> 36:12.937
Your boss is inviting you
to poker games now.

36:13.004 --> 36:14.171
Exactly, so...

36:16.040 --> 36:18.209
I've accomplished everything I need.

36:19.310 --> 36:20.645
We don't need this.

36:21.379 --> 36:22.346
What?

36:26.951 --> 36:28.052
This relationship.

36:28.920 --> 36:29.887
So...

36:31.455 --> 36:34.125
You got what you need,
and now you're done?

36:35.092 --> 36:37.328
- This was a business arrangement.
- Bullshit!

36:37.595 --> 36:38.596
Excuse me?

36:41.666 --> 36:45.336
- Are you making all this up?
- No, I'm being very serious right now.

36:45.403 --> 36:46.537
It's time to call it.

36:48.172 --> 36:49.540
You have feelings for me.

36:50.174 --> 36:51.342
Say no and I'll go.

36:51.409 --> 36:52.476
Orlando, please.

36:53.811 --> 36:54.946
See?

36:55.012 --> 36:56.013
I know you do.

36:56.948 --> 36:58.749
I've never said this to anyone, Kara.

37:00.718 --> 37:01.819
I love you.

37:04.188 --> 37:05.389
Say you don't love me.

37:36.287 --> 37:38.222
If you let me go, I'm not coming back.

38:13.224 --> 38:14.325
Here you are.

38:14.392 --> 38:16.827
I took the liberty of ordering
some room service

38:17.161 --> 38:18.863
and copious amounts of alcohol.

38:22.166 --> 38:23.200
Are you okay?

38:24.402 --> 38:25.369
No.

38:25.803 --> 38:26.771
I'm not.

38:30.074 --> 38:33.110
Ronda effing Sales got my ass again.

38:34.945 --> 38:38.582
She borrowed a billionaire's jet
and flew her vindictive ass to New York

38:38.649 --> 38:40.584
just in time to boot me from the desk.

38:41.619 --> 38:43.654
- I'm sorry.
- No, it's okay.

38:44.522 --> 38:47.491
I had a moment, but I'm over it.
I'm relieved, actually.

38:47.558 --> 38:50.661
Now I can focus
on being the best correspondent I can be.

38:51.128 --> 38:52.263
What? Just like that?

38:53.330 --> 38:54.432
Just like that.

38:54.498 --> 38:55.533
No.

38:55.599 --> 38:56.667
Come on.

38:58.703 --> 39:01.906
Sorry, I've had a hell of a day.

39:03.040 --> 39:06.744
I can't help but feel I'm more
than a little bit responsible for that.

39:08.345 --> 39:10.281
Zoe's request threw me for a loop,

39:10.581 --> 39:12.950
but I realized I was...

39:14.251 --> 39:16.053
I was overlooking something important.

39:17.621 --> 39:18.656
And what's that?

39:19.657 --> 39:21.826
Exactly where you stand with having kids.

39:21.892 --> 39:23.294
Let me stop you right there.

39:24.361 --> 39:25.763
Full disclosure.

39:27.531 --> 39:30.601
My uterus provides
a hostile environment for reproduction.

39:31.535 --> 39:33.704
- But I love your uterus.
- I know you do.

39:35.072 --> 39:37.374
But baby, at my age,
I'm gonna need some help.

39:39.510 --> 39:40.478
Look.

39:42.079 --> 39:43.114
That there

39:43.914 --> 39:45.049
is New York City.

39:45.783 --> 39:48.486
Some of the best fertility doctors
in the world

39:49.153 --> 39:50.187
are right here.

39:52.323 --> 39:53.657
You don't mind the whole

39:54.925 --> 39:56.527
jerking off in a cup thing?

39:57.795 --> 39:58.863
I love you, MJ.

40:01.565 --> 40:02.733
I want you to be happy.

40:06.270 --> 40:07.371
Besides,

40:07.438 --> 40:09.073
I've jerked off in worse places.

40:11.609 --> 40:12.743
I love you.

40:14.445 --> 40:15.479
Love you too.
