00:08.717 --> 00:10.718
Previously on Nurse Jackie...

00:12.429 --> 00:13.429
Fuck.

00:13.514 --> 00:15.473
The diocese is deconsecrating this chapel.

00:15.557 --> 00:16.808
They're taking my statues.

00:16.892 --> 00:18.643
This is the one that matters the most to me.

00:18.727 --> 00:19.727
We're stealing her.

00:20.354 --> 00:21.896
-You have a bunion.
-No, l don't.

00:22.064 --> 00:23.856
Your mother and l are getting a divorce.

00:25.067 --> 00:26.901
He's handling this better than l thought.

00:30.906 --> 00:32.156
l just love being with you.

00:34.410 --> 00:35.910
-Where is Kevin?
-Relax.

00:36.036 --> 00:37.286
l told him l'd watch the kids

00:37.371 --> 00:39.372
so he could get his ass
to an Al-Anon meeting.

00:39.456 --> 00:41.457
He doesn't talk about it
and that fucks him up.

00:42.084 --> 00:43.376
Why are you texting Tunie?

00:43.460 --> 00:44.669
She texted me first.

00:44.753 --> 00:46.170
This is my sister-in-law, Eddie.

00:46.255 --> 00:48.548
And you're telling me this why?

00:48.632 --> 00:50.925
'Cause l don't wanna see you get sucked in.

00:51.051 --> 00:52.677
How much you got?

00:53.595 --> 00:54.846
Two hundred bucks.

00:57.891 --> 00:59.100
l'm rooting for you.

02:11.715 --> 02:14.342
Oh, my God. Dad. Dad.

02:15.427 --> 02:20.556
When you google Lucifer,
you get 42 million results in 0.1 seconds.

02:22.100 --> 02:23.100
Homework.

02:23.185 --> 02:25.812
Forty-two million? How do you pick?

02:26.939 --> 02:30.024
l go by pictures of paintings or whatever.

02:30.567 --> 02:34.821
He was God's favorite, but he tried
to make his throne higher than God's,

02:34.905 --> 02:36.364
which was, you know, greedy.

02:36.907 --> 02:39.033
So that's why God cast him out.

02:39.117 --> 02:43.913
But he didn't care. He still wanted to
be God, so he made himself god of hell.

02:43.997 --> 02:45.373
And then they all lived happily ever after.

02:45.457 --> 02:48.626
Grace, honey, go sit over there with Tunie
and Fi, please. l'll be there in a second.

02:48.710 --> 02:50.461
No, l got it. l got it. Go sit.

02:52.881 --> 02:54.298
The devil, really?

02:57.344 --> 02:59.136
Oh, God, look at that.

02:59.513 --> 03:03.516
"Lucifer, fallen angel, Satan, devil,
Justin Bieber."

03:05.018 --> 03:06.602
l smell a week of nightmares.

03:06.687 --> 03:09.480
Very grateful for Justin Bieber
right about now.

03:09.565 --> 03:11.941
Yeah, that might have been Tunie.

03:12.401 --> 03:14.819
Seriously, Fi,
let's say you wake up in a jail cell,

03:14.903 --> 03:18.030
like in Miami or something,
and you only get one phone call,

03:18.115 --> 03:19.490
and this goes for you, too, Grace.

03:19.575 --> 03:20.825
You've already got them in jail?

03:20.909 --> 03:22.869
Yeah, but don't worry about it.
l'm bailing them out.

03:22.953 --> 03:25.872
Anyway,
they're only gonna give you one call.

03:25.956 --> 03:27.582
Use it on me.

03:27.749 --> 03:30.835
l'm that call.
l will do everything in my power to fix it.

03:30.919 --> 03:32.003
Yes, that is a wonderful plan,

03:32.087 --> 03:34.922
except for the fact that your Aunt Tunie
is probably already in the next cell.

03:35.090 --> 03:37.008
So good luck with that.

03:39.344 --> 03:41.220
l can say whatever the hell l want!

03:41.305 --> 03:42.638
Why don't you shut up?

03:43.807 --> 03:46.684
What did l tell you? Get out of my bar.

03:46.768 --> 03:48.769
lt's okay, guys. lt's okay.

04:02.868 --> 04:05.828
l wasn't gonna hit them.
l was just trying to scare them.

04:06.705 --> 04:08.456
You think it worked?

04:10.042 --> 04:12.209
That was pretty brave of your dad.

04:12.294 --> 04:15.755
Yeah, you guys are lucky.
l mean, he'll protect you.

04:16.131 --> 04:17.924
Your dad is a badass.

04:20.802 --> 04:21.969
Sorry.

04:38.320 --> 04:39.654
l miss you.

05:20.362 --> 05:21.404
Hey.

05:21.822 --> 05:23.447
Coffee. My hero.

05:24.032 --> 05:26.701
-Thank you.
-l'm gonna get the girls up.

05:37.713 --> 05:40.423
-Mom.
-Fiona.

05:40.882 --> 05:43.259
-Hey.
-Gracie.

05:43.552 --> 05:46.178
Yeah, yeah, l get it. You love us the same.

05:46.263 --> 05:48.806
You don't have to make such
a big deal out of everything.

05:48.890 --> 05:52.727
Well, that's too bad 'cause l was gonna
make a big deal about breakfast,

05:52.811 --> 05:55.396
you know, make you whatever you want.
But if you don't care...

05:55.480 --> 05:57.106
-We care.
-l care.

05:57.566 --> 06:01.152
All right, let's go. What are you thinking?

06:01.236 --> 06:02.611
-Waffles.
-Pancakes.

06:02.696 --> 06:05.573
Well, l'll make one or the other.
l can't make them both.

06:05.657 --> 06:07.992
-So what are you thinking?
-Waffles.

06:08.076 --> 06:09.118
All right.

06:27.554 --> 06:30.931
Lily Chung is on her way to DC
to schmooze with the Obama people

06:31.016 --> 06:34.560
and l'm stuck on a curb
watching pirates gut my chapel.

06:35.729 --> 06:36.937
Pirates!

06:38.273 --> 06:39.940
Anything l can do?

06:41.109 --> 06:43.360
Everybody gripes about not enough help,

06:43.445 --> 06:46.155
so l scoured the budget and hired a temp.

06:46.281 --> 06:47.948
His name is Kelly.

06:48.366 --> 06:50.034
Don't eat him alive.

06:50.577 --> 06:52.328
What if l get hungry?

06:52.412 --> 06:53.996
Resist the urge.

06:57.042 --> 06:59.585
-You coming?
-l'll be there in a sec.

07:17.020 --> 07:18.979
-Hey, Jackie.
-Morning.

07:19.606 --> 07:21.398
-You got a sec?
-Sure.

07:26.363 --> 07:28.906
l don't really know how to say this.

07:30.033 --> 07:33.202
There's been a little bit of momentum
between me and Tunie,

07:33.495 --> 07:37.498
and Kevin really wants me
to ask her out, so...

07:39.376 --> 07:40.751
Weird.

07:41.169 --> 07:43.838
-You're asking for my permission?
-No.

07:44.131 --> 07:46.215
-Because you're a big boy.
-Right.

07:46.800 --> 07:49.343
No, it's more like a heads-up situation.

07:50.345 --> 07:51.554
Got it.

07:53.014 --> 07:54.014
l thought a lot about it.

07:54.099 --> 07:56.851
l think l'm gonna take her over to
the Museum of Natural History.

07:59.980 --> 08:01.689
She will love that.

08:08.697 --> 08:10.990
Lower East Side robbery,
25-year-old female,

08:11.074 --> 08:12.867
innocent bystander,
caught a bullet in the arm.

08:12.951 --> 08:14.451
BP is stable. Pulse is good.

08:14.536 --> 08:16.370
You better not have left my dog there.
Where's my dog?

08:16.454 --> 08:19.623
Thirty-five-year-old male, first on the scene,
found down, difficulty breathing.

08:19.708 --> 08:22.168
BP started out at 1 60/1 00,
but he's good now.

08:22.252 --> 08:24.837
What do you mean good?
l got trampled.

08:24.963 --> 08:27.506
-Dude, your foot.
-Blew out my Achilles. Epic.

08:27.591 --> 08:30.509
-That's rough, bro.
-Trampled here. Come on.

08:31.887 --> 08:33.304
Hey, can l have the gunshot?

08:33.388 --> 08:34.847
Mind your own business, Dr. Cooper.

08:34.973 --> 08:36.640
Easy, bossy. You're not chief yet.

08:37.058 --> 08:38.559
Hi, honey. l'm Jackie.

08:38.977 --> 08:43.898
Hey, everything all right? My name's Kelly.
You're at All Saints. You're gonna be okay.

08:43.982 --> 08:46.150
Just hold on for a sec. You're gonna be fine.

08:48.153 --> 08:50.571
You, go and assist Dr. Cooper.

08:51.114 --> 08:52.323
Got it.

08:54.743 --> 08:56.952
-You hanging in there?
-Where's my dog?

08:57.037 --> 08:58.120
Can you wiggle your fingers?

08:58.246 --> 09:01.749
One minute he's up. The next minute,
l'm like, "Where the fuck did he go?"

09:01.833 --> 09:05.586
Everybody's running for cover and Ryan's
getting jostled like Raggedy fucking Ann.

09:05.670 --> 09:07.338
Jostled? l got pummeled.

09:07.797 --> 09:10.799
Probably got boot marks
and internal bleeding.

09:11.384 --> 09:12.843
l think l need morphine, Doc.

09:13.136 --> 09:15.262
-l don't see any boot marks.
-Shut up.

09:15.347 --> 09:18.349
-Calm down, Ryan.
-All non-essential persons out now.

09:18.433 --> 09:20.851
-Everyone, out.
-Waiting room, guys.

09:22.103 --> 09:24.730
Seriously, Doc,
l need something for the pain.

09:24.856 --> 09:26.523
lt's fucking killing me here.

09:26.650 --> 09:29.652
-On a scale from one to 1 0? Eleven.
-l got you.

09:30.028 --> 09:31.737
Let's throw a little morphine his way.

09:33.240 --> 09:35.157
Mia, can you tell me where your pain is?

09:36.618 --> 09:38.535
Feels like l got punched. lt's fine.

09:38.620 --> 09:42.957
But l am gonna go apeshit if someone
doesn't tell me where my dog is, truly.

09:43.083 --> 09:46.001
Awesome dog. She's in my rig. lt's all good.

09:47.045 --> 09:50.422
Found this on the gurney.
Went right through her arm.

09:52.092 --> 09:53.300
You always smell so nice.

09:55.804 --> 09:57.221
Yeah, l'm out.

09:57.305 --> 10:00.474
Kelly, that's a girl's name.
Bet they gave you shit growing up.

10:00.558 --> 10:03.477
Well, they might have given it,
but l never took it, that's for sure.

10:03.687 --> 10:08.399
l feel you. l'm the same way, man.
The same way for sure.

10:09.025 --> 10:11.026
Fuck, l think l broke a rib.

10:11.111 --> 10:13.487
Let's get some films on him
and check it out.

10:13.571 --> 10:16.156
-Kelly's gonna call x-ray.
-We go first.

10:16.283 --> 10:18.325
l need to rule out
remaining bullet fragments.

10:18.410 --> 10:20.703
-Pain, one to 1 0?
-Two.

10:21.246 --> 10:24.081
-Don't let him leave with my dog.
-l won't.

10:28.295 --> 10:30.838
-That better not be a dog.
-lt's not.

10:45.395 --> 10:48.314
Actually, l'm a little bit allergic to dogs.

10:48.440 --> 10:50.774
You've got a wall full of Zyrtec.

10:51.860 --> 10:53.902
Deep breaths, deep breaths.

10:55.113 --> 10:58.282
l was doing so good.
And then, pow! Divorce.

10:58.616 --> 11:02.369
Pow! l wanna be chief. Pow! l wreck my foot.

11:04.831 --> 11:07.750
-What did l ever do?
-Short list or long list?

11:07.876 --> 11:10.336
l'm gonna ignore you right now
until l feel safe.

11:12.005 --> 11:15.466
My tic is back.
l came this close to grabbing Akalitus' tit.

11:15.550 --> 11:17.926
Fucking Akalitus. She knew, too.

11:18.136 --> 11:19.219
Fuck.

11:19.888 --> 11:24.224
lf l wasn't using my hand to lean
on this crutch... l mean, l can't even...

11:24.309 --> 11:27.519
So you're using the crutch as a crutch?

11:27.604 --> 11:29.146
Yes. Yes, l am.

11:37.739 --> 11:40.908
Okay. Okay, l feel safe now.

11:44.704 --> 11:47.915
So here's the thing, l'm gonna need
a little extra TLC on the floor today.

12:03.681 --> 12:05.599
l believe in you, Coop.

12:08.978 --> 12:10.771
That was from love, right?

12:14.067 --> 12:15.442
-Please?
-No.

12:16.236 --> 12:19.571
l don't believe for a minute
that you're a nurse.

12:19.781 --> 12:21.865
l'll answer whatever l can.

12:22.409 --> 12:24.618
You'll do nothing of the kind.

12:25.120 --> 12:31.333
She looks like someone
who gives eardrops to old cats.

12:31.835 --> 12:37.381
That is the same getup
they wear in the veterinary offices.

12:40.718 --> 12:43.554
-Hi, guys.
-What have you done to your hair?

12:43.638 --> 12:46.056
-Mom.
-This is Tottie.

12:46.516 --> 12:50.853
She's 95 and she had an incident
at Jersey Boys. That's all l could get.

12:51.271 --> 12:53.564
She had heart palpitations and chest pain.

12:53.648 --> 12:55.732
Well, it's a bizarre show.

12:55.817 --> 12:58.402
No, it's not. lt's a wonderful show.

12:58.486 --> 12:59.820
l loved it.

13:00.113 --> 13:02.614
-People like it.
-People are idiots.

13:04.617 --> 13:05.659
Were you with her at the time?

13:06.077 --> 13:09.496
No. l got a call from a nurse's aide
from St. Albans.

13:11.666 --> 13:13.250
What have we here?

13:13.543 --> 13:17.713
Finally, a woman
who's not wearing trousers.

13:21.426 --> 13:22.759
All yours.

13:28.308 --> 13:29.641
Oh, my God, he's in your chair.

13:29.726 --> 13:31.268
lt's Haiti, man, all right?

13:31.352 --> 13:33.061
And they got nothing.
And when l say nothing,

13:33.146 --> 13:35.564
l mean, like,
l'm using a shoelace to tie off a gusher

13:35.648 --> 13:38.942
and grabbing fucking dish soap from
the rubble to wash out a wound.

13:39.027 --> 13:40.194
And that's on a good day.

13:40.278 --> 13:41.945
l will take him out back and school him.

13:42.113 --> 13:44.907
Look, here's the truth,
you gotta take your skills and travel,

13:44.991 --> 13:48.243
even if it's to another hospital.
These nurses that stay in one place,

13:48.328 --> 13:51.497
it's deadly, man.
l mean, they're off their game.

13:55.168 --> 13:56.210
Were you sitting here?

13:57.045 --> 13:58.545
lt's her desk!

13:59.756 --> 14:03.050
My mistake.
Didn't know you all had assigned desks.

14:03.718 --> 14:04.968
We don't.

14:06.221 --> 14:08.430
Squatter's rights. l respect that.
That shit is real.

14:09.974 --> 14:11.308
Hey...

14:12.894 --> 14:14.937
Sorry if l muscled in on your gunshot.

14:16.105 --> 14:18.857
ln trauma? Your gunshot?

14:20.026 --> 14:21.610
l didn't notice.

14:31.579 --> 14:32.829
Snap.

14:33.081 --> 14:34.706
No, we don't say that anymore.

14:34.791 --> 14:36.792
-For real.
-That either.

14:39.462 --> 14:41.380
You okay? You tolerating the pain okay?

14:41.464 --> 14:43.173
Yeah, no, it's fine.

14:43.258 --> 14:45.509
Can you do me favor, though?
Can you call my sister?

14:45.593 --> 14:49.763
She works at Blue Ribbon on Sullivan.
l need her to come get my dog.

14:50.139 --> 14:51.682
-What's your sister's name?
-Hayley.

14:51.766 --> 14:53.141
You got it.

14:55.311 --> 14:58.355
Quick question. And tell me the truth,
not that you wouldn't tell me the truth.

14:58.439 --> 15:00.274
-Thor.
-What do you think of Kelly?

15:01.484 --> 15:03.443
-l think he's great.
-l am so relieved.

15:04.195 --> 15:05.988
l think he's amazing.

15:06.614 --> 15:08.740
-Blood sugar?
-Why? Do l seem light-headed?

15:08.908 --> 15:10.200
A tiny bit.

15:15.039 --> 15:17.040
Looks good. No fractures.

15:17.458 --> 15:19.334
-You go to med school?
-No.

15:19.460 --> 15:22.963
Yeah, well, no offense.
l'd rather have the doc's opinion here.

15:23.172 --> 15:24.881
Yo, Kel, l got it.

15:32.890 --> 15:35.892
Well, you got the wind knocked out of you,
that's for sure,

15:36.811 --> 15:38.729
but the ribs look good. Nice and clean.

15:38.813 --> 15:42.691
No. l mean, l heard a crack. Plus, l felt it.

15:43.443 --> 15:45.402
l mean something definitely popped.

15:46.029 --> 15:47.821
l know my body, man.

15:48.448 --> 15:50.032
Hey, what happened to your foot?

15:50.116 --> 15:52.284
My grandmother had one of those
after bunion surgery.

15:52.660 --> 15:55.412
This? No, please.

15:56.414 --> 15:58.206
Trashed my Achilles playing hoops.

15:58.499 --> 16:01.668
Massive, as in,
it's a miracle l still have a foot.

16:02.795 --> 16:04.254
Bunion.

16:04.547 --> 16:05.589
No.

16:06.674 --> 16:09.801
Jeez, that must've killed.

16:09.969 --> 16:13.305
Dude, you have no idea.

16:15.099 --> 16:19.394
We're out of ideas. lf she's thrown
out of St. Albans, she'll end up with me.

16:19.479 --> 16:22.564
My wife will leave. She's 45. She'll do it.

16:22.899 --> 16:25.359
Let's not catastrophize. There are options.

16:25.443 --> 16:26.943
And they've tried them all.

16:27.028 --> 16:31.031
Xanax, Valium, b-cog, art therapy.

16:31.240 --> 16:34.868
Good Lord! Art therapy?

16:37.997 --> 16:40.207
Could you give us a moment?

16:49.008 --> 16:50.425
Wow, you were hungry.

16:50.885 --> 16:53.178
You want me to get you another pudding?
l can totally score more.

16:53.262 --> 16:55.889
No, but you know what would be great?

16:56.849 --> 17:02.062
You know that guy that brought me in,
cute with a beard? He took care of my dog.

17:03.564 --> 17:06.066
-Will you give this to him?
-You mean Lenny?

17:06.901 --> 17:09.236
You want me to thank him for you?

17:10.405 --> 17:12.447
l kinda wanna ask him out.

17:17.578 --> 17:18.578
Yes.

17:20.331 --> 17:21.873
That's a seven?

17:24.377 --> 17:25.585
Will do.

17:29.424 --> 17:31.675
So, Tottie, one last question,

17:33.594 --> 17:37.764
do you now or have you ever
had a problem with alcohol?

17:37.890 --> 17:40.267
Yes, prohibition.

17:41.310 --> 17:44.396
Yes, it was a dark time
in your country's history. l'd have fled.

17:45.022 --> 17:48.567
Are you ever able to enjoy
a cocktail at St. Albans?

17:48.776 --> 17:53.780
No.
They give us fruit juice during happy hour.

17:54.282 --> 17:56.283
lt's humiliating.

17:56.909 --> 18:01.246
My husband and l used to travel a lot.

18:03.624 --> 18:06.960
Every day at 5:00

18:07.879 --> 18:09.880
we'd have a little sherry.

18:11.132 --> 18:13.633
We had such a good time.

18:17.472 --> 18:22.058
How would you feel about
a glass of sherry a day, doctor's orders?

18:23.311 --> 18:24.936
l'd be delighted.

18:25.813 --> 18:28.815
Just a reminder,
Percocet for the gunshot in four.

18:29.817 --> 18:31.568
That awful hair.

18:31.652 --> 18:34.029
Hey, no hooch for you if you can't behave.

18:37.950 --> 18:41.578
l wish it were broken 'cause, you know,
l went through something.

18:42.455 --> 18:44.956
And no one can see the pain l'm in.

18:45.374 --> 18:47.709
That whole shaking it off thing,
what is that?

18:48.419 --> 18:51.087
My parents are getting divorced.
l can barely get out of bed in the morning.

18:51.172 --> 18:52.631
That's rough, man.

18:54.383 --> 18:57.427
You remember when you were a kid
you could whimper a little?

18:57.512 --> 19:00.263
-Your old man, he'd just...
-No old man. Two moms.

19:00.348 --> 19:02.599
Nowjust one. lt's not even the one l like.

19:02.683 --> 19:04.768
And no one around here even gives a shit.

19:04.852 --> 19:07.729
Hey, l give a shit.

19:08.356 --> 19:09.856
Pain is pain.

19:13.236 --> 19:16.488
l don't know, there might be
a hairline fracture in there somewhere.

19:17.323 --> 19:19.324
-Right?
-Tell you what,

19:20.243 --> 19:23.787
l'm gonna tell your friends out there
that you broke all your ribs

19:23.871 --> 19:25.580
and that you're lucky to be alive.

19:26.874 --> 19:28.291
Fuck, man.

19:30.378 --> 19:31.711
You're gonna make me cry.

19:33.881 --> 19:36.341
l used to work with this kid in the Bronx
who went off a roof.

19:36.425 --> 19:38.927
-l do some work up there with at-risk teens.
-That's cool.

19:39.262 --> 19:42.264
l'm trying to get my sobriety back.
lt ain't easy.

19:42.390 --> 19:45.183
Keep coming back. lt works if you work it.

19:45.351 --> 19:46.935
l hear you, man.

19:49.230 --> 19:51.690
Sam, take them to the waiting room.

19:52.233 --> 19:54.234
-Now, please.
-l'm on it.

19:57.613 --> 19:59.322
You gonna let her talk to you like that?

20:00.867 --> 20:03.201
lt's just the way she talks, bro.

20:09.458 --> 20:11.084
Here he is.

20:11.961 --> 20:13.003
-The nerd.
-The nerd.

20:13.087 --> 20:14.462
-Crap.
-Really?

20:14.547 --> 20:16.214
Nerds end up rich.

20:16.424 --> 20:18.008
l wish Dad was a nerd.

20:18.092 --> 20:19.801
Your dad is a nerd.

20:20.928 --> 20:22.095
Hello?

20:22.388 --> 20:24.306
-Hey, Jackie.
-You know where Kevin is?

20:24.390 --> 20:26.600
-Tried his cell, he's not picking up.
-He's at a softball game.

20:26.684 --> 20:29.603
And FYl, he is in an awesome mood.

20:29.770 --> 20:31.187
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

20:32.565 --> 20:35.859
Don't ask me how, but he found out
you're going to those meetings.

20:36.110 --> 20:37.360
He's like a new guy.

20:37.445 --> 20:40.280
Well, what can l say?
lt works if you work it, right?

20:40.364 --> 20:42.782
All right, l'll see you later. Bye.

20:47.955 --> 20:49.247
-Hi.
-Hey.

20:50.666 --> 20:54.586
Why am l here? Percocet. O'Hara's gunshot.

20:54.962 --> 20:58.131
Kelly picked it up, then came back,
swapped it out for Motrin.

20:58.466 --> 21:00.508
The patient was tolerating the pain.

21:01.302 --> 21:05.055
Score another one for the female
of the species. You guys are rockin' it.

21:05.806 --> 21:06.806
Okay.

21:25.159 --> 21:26.409
You okay?

21:30.081 --> 21:31.873
Please don't go out with Tunie.

21:54.522 --> 21:55.689
Bingo.

22:10.037 --> 22:11.329
You okay?

22:14.041 --> 22:15.125
No.

22:16.585 --> 22:18.837
You know, Kevin's being a dick.

22:20.047 --> 22:21.756
But what are you gonna do?

22:26.345 --> 22:27.846
We could talk.

22:29.348 --> 22:30.432
Yeah?

22:32.226 --> 22:33.727
lf you'd like.

22:35.771 --> 22:37.564
That would be great.

22:52.038 --> 22:54.873
-Advice, please.
-Only if it's about a patient.

22:54.957 --> 22:56.750
Naturally. Strictly professional.

22:56.834 --> 23:00.545
Your patient has requested
that l give her number to Lenny.

23:01.839 --> 23:05.050
Okay, not so strictly.
But come on, you're you.

23:06.844 --> 23:08.720
Well, let's see. lf it were me...

23:08.804 --> 23:09.929
This is amazing. Keep going.

23:10.056 --> 23:13.099
l'd burn it and throw the ashes to the wind.

23:16.604 --> 23:18.396
Do you like living in a hotel?

23:19.231 --> 23:20.982
Actually, no. l'm looking to buy a place.

23:21.067 --> 23:25.361
Shut up! 'Cause l'm moving to the city.
What neighborhood? We could be neighbs.

23:25.446 --> 23:27.447
l'll keep you in the loop.

23:28.908 --> 23:31.493
Like you could ever afford to live
in the same neighborhood as her.

23:31.660 --> 23:33.244
She's rich, dude.

23:33.329 --> 23:35.288
How do you know l'm not?

23:39.251 --> 23:41.878
l'm not rich, but that was rude of him.

23:41.962 --> 23:43.963
Okay, that is no.

23:51.180 --> 23:53.098
The eagle flies at dawn.

23:53.474 --> 23:54.808
Excuse me?

23:55.476 --> 23:58.061
No, l was just... Spy talk?

24:01.482 --> 24:03.983
Look, l don't know what his deal is,

24:04.151 --> 24:05.568
but Kelly keeps taking your desk.

24:05.653 --> 24:07.821
And l have told him
on more than one occasion, that it is your...

24:07.905 --> 24:11.282
Zoey, it's okay. Go easy on him. He's new.
lt's fine.

24:15.621 --> 24:16.830
Give me what the lady had.

24:21.585 --> 24:23.711
No. Got any Sour Patch Kids?

24:38.811 --> 24:40.019
Boober.

24:41.063 --> 24:42.480
Want a bite?

24:49.864 --> 24:51.447
This is for you.

24:52.366 --> 24:54.033
Do what you want.

25:02.001 --> 25:03.001
What?

25:03.878 --> 25:06.004
There was a number on there.

25:06.380 --> 25:08.131
-Was it yours?
-No.

25:12.219 --> 25:14.929
Like l have time for anyone except you.

25:28.694 --> 25:30.695
lt's fucking sad in here.

25:36.911 --> 25:40.288
l wrote a prescription for six ounces
of sherry, to be taken once a day.

25:40.372 --> 25:42.165
Can you fill it?

25:42.333 --> 25:43.374
No.

25:45.753 --> 25:49.714
But l have Jameson.

25:53.802 --> 25:56.512
Last call for all that is good and holy.

25:58.265 --> 25:59.766
That ain't me.

26:04.605 --> 26:07.857
-Love you. See you. Cheers.
-See you later, Jackie.

26:35.511 --> 26:40.306
Hey, just wanted to say thanks
for a great first day.

26:41.267 --> 26:43.226
-See you.
-Yeah, see you.

26:46.313 --> 26:49.065
Don't tell me you were nice to the new guy.

26:49.149 --> 26:52.610
l don't know.
You looked like you could use a miracle.

27:04.206 --> 27:06.749
Here you go, lady. You gotta sign it.

27:08.377 --> 27:10.670
Say goodbye to your saints.

27:11.672 --> 27:12.839
Never.
