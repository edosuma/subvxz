A little.

How'd you find out where I live?

00:48.256 --> 00:50.091
I have my ways.

00:51.718 --> 00:54.179
I looked up your address

02:24.811 --> 02:26.855
for more than a century,
the world has

02:26.938 --> 02:30.149
welcomed in the New Year
with the annual Rose Parade.

02:30.233 --> 02:33.278
Magnificent floral floats,

02:33.361 --> 02:36.072
melodious marching bands,

02:36.155 --> 02:38.700
expert equestrians
and the reigning centerpiece

02:38.783 --> 02:42.912
of the festivities, the Rose
Queen and her Royal Court,

02:42.996 --> 02:45.915
a holiday tradition for
hundreds of millions

02:45.999 --> 02:47.417
of people worldwide.

02:47.500 --> 02:48.293
So, please...

02:48.376 --> 02:51.462
{\an3}Where did they learn
to wave like that?

Oh, it's all in the wrist.

Hello.

02:54.966 --> 02:55.967
{\an3}(chuckles)

02:56.050 --> 02:59.053
Hi. I'm Leslie Sumner.

02:59.137 --> 03:00.430
It's my privilege
to be here today

03:00.513 --> 03:02.432
representing
the Tournament of Roses.

03:02.515 --> 03:04.809
Some of you might remember me
when I attended C.U.

03:04.893 --> 03:06.936
and was president
of the Alpha Omega sorority.

03:07.020 --> 03:09.731
(cheering, applause)

03:09.814 --> 03:12.108
Well, here I am, living proof
that when you graduate

03:12.191 --> 03:13.610
from college, you might
actually get a job.

03:13.693 --> 03:15.278
(laughter)

03:15.361 --> 03:17.071
As assistant director
of public relations

03:17.155 --> 03:19.449
for the Tournament of Roses,
I thought it might be fun

03:19.532 --> 03:21.284
to come back here
and encourage C.U. women

03:21.367 --> 03:23.119
to try out for the Royal Court.

03:23.202 --> 03:24.954
{\an1}(whispering):
Sounds fun.

03:25.038 --> 03:27.248
Donna, you are such
a sucker for tiaras.

03:27.332 --> 03:28.917
{\an5}LESLIE:
...even the tryouts
are an event.

03:29.000 --> 03:31.628
And you and an escort
receive tickets

03:31.711 --> 03:34.130
to one of the most terrific
parties of the year,

03:34.213 --> 03:35.298
the Royal Ball,
(door opens)

03:35.381 --> 03:37.300
featuring fabulous
big band music

03:37.383 --> 03:38.217
and dancing all night long.

03:38.301 --> 03:41.137
The selection process
for the Rose Queen

03:41.220 --> 03:42.805
{\an6}has become
an enormous challenge,
(clears throat)

03:42.889 --> 03:43.806
with over 700...

03:43.890 --> 03:46.809
{\an3}Harmless tradition or
sexist institution?

03:46.893 --> 03:48.269
What do you think?

03:48.353 --> 03:49.604
I think anything that's
lasted a hundred years

03:49.687 --> 03:51.272
can't be all bad.

03:51.356 --> 03:52.315
{\an1}What are you
doing here, anyway?

03:52.398 --> 03:54.525
Leslie Sumner's an old friend.

03:54.609 --> 03:57.445
I thought I'd check it out,
maybe write a column.

03:57.528 --> 03:58.279
{\an1}Fine.

03:58.363 --> 04:00.073
I can run it
opposite my editorial,

04:00.156 --> 04:01.783
if it's halfway literate.

04:01.866 --> 04:04.160
Let me guess your lead.

04:04.243 --> 04:07.372
"The Tournament of Roses Royal
Court is just another excuse

04:07.455 --> 04:10.500
to have women
parading around like morons."

04:10.583 --> 04:11.501
{\an1}Not bad.

04:11.584 --> 04:12.543
Mind if I steal that?

04:12.627 --> 04:14.879
{\an3}Be my guest.
Hmm.

04:14.963 --> 04:16.005
What's your lead gonna be?

04:16.089 --> 04:17.423
I love a parade.

04:17.507 --> 04:19.634
(clears throat)

04:24.430 --> 04:26.516
{\an1}Hi, Ray.

04:26.599 --> 04:27.517
{\an1}Hi, Donna.

04:27.600 --> 04:28.351
Hi.
Hey.

04:28.434 --> 04:30.311
Jessica, right?
You remembered.

04:30.395 --> 04:32.522
Now, how could I forget
a face as cute as yours?

04:32.605 --> 04:34.190
Thanks.

04:34.274 --> 04:36.150
{\an3}So, how come you're
not in school?

04:36.234 --> 04:37.777
I kind of have a cold.

04:37.860 --> 04:40.655
See, my left nose is stuffed up,
and that's why I'm here

04:40.738 --> 04:43.116
hanging out and helping my dad
run the company.

04:44.450 --> 04:45.952
Want some?

04:46.035 --> 04:47.203
Uh, no thanks.

04:47.286 --> 04:48.329
{\an1}KORMAN:
Jessie, where's Christina?

04:48.413 --> 04:50.456
Oh, she went to smoke
a cigarette down in the garage.

04:50.540 --> 04:51.416
Great.

04:51.499 --> 04:52.583
Hi, Mr. Korman.

04:52.667 --> 04:53.710
Donna, Ray, didn't Christina
call you

04:53.793 --> 04:54.877
to cancel?
I can't see you today.

04:54.961 --> 04:56.045
Oh.

04:56.129 --> 04:57.046
{\an1}KORMAN:
Don't worry.

04:57.130 --> 04:58.715
We'll reschedule.

04:58.798 --> 04:59.716
Has my Jessica been

04:59.799 --> 05:00.883
taking good
care of you?

05:00.967 --> 05:02.719
Oh, yeah.
I haven't been offered

05:02.802 --> 05:05.263
apple juice in a box
with a little straw in years.

05:05.346 --> 05:06.431
I think you should put her
on the payroll.

05:06.514 --> 05:07.765
I told you, Daddy.

05:07.849 --> 05:09.142
{\an3}Oh, now I'm
in trouble.

05:09.225 --> 05:11.102
Uh, Mr. Korman,
I brought you a tape.

05:11.185 --> 05:13.312
Uh, just leave it.
I'll get to it soon.

05:16.441 --> 05:18.359
I'll listen to it.

05:18.443 --> 05:20.862
Thanks, sweetheart.

05:22.488 --> 05:24.198
Think you have a fan.

05:25.450 --> 05:27.326
(chuckles)

05:33.374 --> 05:35.752
{\an3}"I'm a sensitive,
gentle, caring person.

05:35.835 --> 05:38.129
{\an4}"For me,
honesty is everything.
(typing)

05:38.212 --> 05:39.422
"I have to be
friends first,

05:39.505 --> 05:40.923
and that takes time."

05:41.007 --> 05:41.924
What are you doing?

05:42.008 --> 05:42.925
(beep)

05:43.009 --> 05:44.093
Trolling the C.U. love lines.

05:44.177 --> 05:46.888
{\an1}Shouldn't you be doing your
homework for your math tutor?

05:46.971 --> 05:48.723
{\an3}Hey, I get enough of
that from Clare, okay?

05:48.806 --> 05:49.724
{\an3}Back off.

05:49.807 --> 05:50.933
Besides, I got a hot one here.

05:51.017 --> 05:51.934
{\an1}Steve,
I don't want

05:52.018 --> 05:53.311
to step on your toes,

05:53.394 --> 05:54.562
or anything else
for that matter,

05:54.645 --> 05:55.938
but, uh, why don't you just

05:56.022 --> 05:57.607
get a dirty magazine
like normal people?

05:57.690 --> 06:00.610
Besides-- "sensitive,
gentle, caring"?

06:00.693 --> 06:02.320
Ever hear of
truth in advertising?

06:02.403 --> 06:04.781
Well, yeah, but you get
more honey with flies.

06:04.864 --> 06:05.865
(chuckles)

06:07.867 --> 06:09.619
Can't argue
with logic like that.

06:09.702 --> 06:11.412
Okay, stand back.
Here comes her reply.

06:11.496 --> 06:13.915
{\an3}"Dear
Tenderheart..."

06:13.998 --> 06:15.500
{\an1}Tenderheart?
What is he, the king

06:15.583 --> 06:16.959
{\an1}of some country
I never heard of?

06:17.043 --> 06:18.002
{\an3}Actually, he's
a Care Bear.

06:18.086 --> 06:19.295
Sneaky, huh?

06:19.378 --> 06:21.005
Gets them right in the G-spot.

06:23.049 --> 06:24.675
Uh...

06:24.759 --> 06:26.302
"It's so hard to meet guys

06:26.385 --> 06:28.763
{\an3}"like you, with such
a sensitive soul.

06:28.846 --> 06:30.348
{\an1}"You really are
an exception.

06:30.431 --> 06:32.141
"I-I'd like to get
to know you better.

06:32.225 --> 06:33.684
E-mail me. Love, Cuddles."

06:33.768 --> 06:35.311
Are you really serious
about this?

06:35.394 --> 06:36.979
Hey, hey, don't knock it.

06:37.063 --> 06:38.773
One of my KEG pledges
met his girlfriend this way.

06:38.856 --> 06:40.316
And she's a knockout.

06:40.399 --> 06:41.859
Beats the hell
out of a blind date.

06:41.943 --> 06:42.860
Want to try?

06:42.944 --> 06:43.778
(chuckles):
No, thanks.

06:43.861 --> 06:45.988
{\an1}I got my hands full
with Ms. Susan Keats.

06:46.072 --> 06:47.865
{\an1}Oh, yeah?
A little newsroom necking?

06:47.949 --> 06:49.325
{\an3}Not quite.

06:49.408 --> 06:51.160
{\an3}I haven't found her
defrost button quite yet.

06:51.244 --> 06:52.829
Well, tell her
what Tenderheart would say.

06:52.912 --> 06:54.163
And what's that, Steve?

06:54.247 --> 06:56.833
Love makes me cry.

06:56.916 --> 06:59.585
And use a little lip.

07:01.587 --> 07:02.964
Like that?

07:03.047 --> 07:04.799
It gets them.

07:08.803 --> 07:11.639
(Sheila humming tune)

07:18.479 --> 07:20.648
Ma, would you play
a card already?

07:20.731 --> 07:21.649
I'm going nuts here.

07:21.732 --> 07:23.693
Oh. Okay.

07:27.446 --> 07:30.366
Oh!

07:30.449 --> 07:31.367
Gin.

07:31.450 --> 07:33.244
(both chuckle)

07:33.327 --> 07:34.537
All right, that's it,
you got me.

07:34.620 --> 07:35.538
I'm out of here.

07:35.621 --> 07:36.914
Oh, one more hand.

07:36.998 --> 07:38.124
I'm all cleaned out.

07:38.207 --> 07:39.375
Oh, come on.

07:39.458 --> 07:41.836
It's my first night
in my new apartment.

07:41.919 --> 07:42.920
Keep me company.

07:43.004 --> 07:44.422
Ma, I've been
keeping you company

07:44.505 --> 07:45.590
for, like, three hours now.

07:45.673 --> 07:47.175
I got to go home and study.

07:47.258 --> 07:48.968
I told you to bring your books.
I could've helped you.

07:50.428 --> 07:53.014
You know, I'm a cum laude.

07:53.097 --> 07:55.850
Look, I told you,
I-I got to go home.

07:55.933 --> 07:57.852
Just one more hand.

07:57.935 --> 08:00.605
Please?

08:03.983 --> 08:05.359
All right, fine. One more.

08:05.443 --> 08:08.237
{\an3}That's it.

08:08.321 --> 08:10.031
(sighs)

08:12.658 --> 08:14.202
{\an3}Hey, Nat.

08:14.285 --> 08:15.411
Huh?

08:15.494 --> 08:17.788
{\an3}If "X" squared
is 81,

08:17.872 --> 08:19.874
what's seven times "X"?

08:19.957 --> 08:21.417
Sixty-three.

08:21.500 --> 08:22.793
How'd he do that?

08:22.877 --> 08:25.213
{\an3}It's nine times
seven, Steve.

08:25.296 --> 08:27.131
{\an3}Will you quit giving him
the answers, Willie?

08:27.215 --> 08:28.382
Why?

08:28.466 --> 08:30.134
Because it's called cheating.

08:30.218 --> 08:32.385
And that's how you got into
this trouble to begin with.

08:32.470 --> 08:34.179
{\an3}(sneers)

08:34.263 --> 08:35.556
{\an3}Hello.

08:35.640 --> 08:36.557
Homework, please.

08:36.640 --> 08:38.517
{\an1}(chuckles)

08:38.601 --> 08:40.602
(clears throat)

08:43.313 --> 08:44.607
{\an3}(chuckles)

08:44.690 --> 08:47.068
{\an3}Two problems
out of 30.

08:47.151 --> 08:48.069
Twenty-eight?

08:48.152 --> 08:49.070
Good.

08:49.153 --> 08:51.614
You can subtract.

08:51.697 --> 08:53.533
Steve, I told you
to show your work.

08:53.616 --> 08:54.450
Clare, what do you care?

08:54.533 --> 08:55.451
You're still getting paid.

08:55.534 --> 08:57.495
Let me ask you something.

08:57.578 --> 08:59.956
If you don't do the work,
who gets hurt, you or me?

09:00.039 --> 09:01.624
Oh, I'm sorry, Miss Arnold.

09:01.707 --> 09:03.334
I thought this was
a victimless crime.

09:03.417 --> 09:05.628
You know what? I hope you
look good in a paper hat.

09:05.711 --> 09:07.380
Give me that, all right?

09:07.463 --> 09:08.381
I'll do it.

09:08.464 --> 09:11.467
{\an3}From now on, if you
don't do your homework,

09:11.550 --> 09:12.343
you pay double.

09:12.426 --> 09:14.303
{\an3}See ya.

09:14.387 --> 09:15.638
If she hits me one more time...

09:15.721 --> 09:17.348
{\an4}(sighs):
Hi, guys.
Hey.

09:17.431 --> 09:18.349
{\an3}Hi.
Hey.

09:18.432 --> 09:19.308
So what's
the verdict?

09:19.392 --> 09:21.435
Are you gonna throw
your tiara in the ring?

09:21.519 --> 09:22.812
Yeah, I'm in.

09:22.895 --> 09:24.272
{\an3}Me, too.

09:24.355 --> 09:26.315
{\an3}I figure we owe it to
Leslie to at least show up.

09:26.399 --> 09:28.484
{\an1}Well, luckily,
I don't know Leslie.

09:28.567 --> 09:30.611
{\an3}Hey, if I can do
it, you can do it.

09:30.695 --> 09:32.154
{\an3}Besides, we're just
doing it to go

09:32.238 --> 09:33.948
to the Tournament of
Roses party, right?

09:34.031 --> 09:35.449
Yeah, I guess.

09:35.533 --> 09:37.201
But when I was eight years old,

09:37.285 --> 09:39.453
Cindy Walsh and my mother
entered Brenda and I

09:39.537 --> 09:40.830
in the Little Miss
Minneapolis pageant.

09:40.913 --> 09:42.373
You're kidding.

09:42.456 --> 09:44.041
{\an4}VALERIE:
Yeah, we didn't
make it to the finals,

09:44.125 --> 09:45.835
but at least Brenda
didn't throw up on a judge.

09:45.918 --> 09:47.169
{\an3}(laughs)

09:47.253 --> 09:48.671
{\an1}All right,
Valerie's excused.

09:48.754 --> 09:50.006
{\an1}Thank you.

09:50.089 --> 09:51.841
{\an3}Oh, I'm pretty
sure that I'm not

09:51.924 --> 09:53.467
gonna get Colin to
go to this thing.

09:53.551 --> 09:54.552
How come?

09:54.635 --> 09:55.678
{\an3}He's a
workaholic.

09:55.761 --> 09:57.138
Once he starts a project,

09:57.221 --> 09:58.514
he won't leave
until it's finished.

09:58.597 --> 10:00.182
Well, I'm paying for the mural.

10:00.266 --> 10:01.350
I'll give him the night off.

10:01.434 --> 10:03.394
Valerie, please,
just stay out of it.

10:03.477 --> 10:05.187
He'll think
that I put you up to it,

10:05.271 --> 10:06.522
and then he'll be furious at me.

10:06.605 --> 10:08.107
Nah, leave it to me.

10:08.190 --> 10:09.066
I'll get to him.

10:09.150 --> 10:11.902
{\an3}All right.

10:22.830 --> 10:23.748
Hey, Michelangelo.

10:23.831 --> 10:26.375
How's it going?

10:26.459 --> 10:27.877
Well, it's, uh, not quite

10:27.960 --> 10:29.754
{\an1}the finger of God
touching the hand of man,

10:29.837 --> 10:32.048
but it's definitely a start.

10:32.131 --> 10:34.216
Do you need any help?

10:34.300 --> 10:35.926
Actually, that'd be great, yeah.

10:40.806 --> 10:43.601
Take this end all the
way down over there.

10:45.603 --> 10:46.520
Like this?

10:46.604 --> 10:47.772
Yeah.

10:47.855 --> 10:48.773
Just follow the edge.

10:48.856 --> 10:50.941
{\an3}You got it?

10:51.025 --> 10:51.942
(chuckles):
Yeah.

10:52.026 --> 10:53.527
Now, start pressing it down

10:53.611 --> 10:55.154
and, uh, work your way
up toward me.

11:02.495 --> 11:03.537
(laughs):
How am I doing?

11:03.621 --> 11:06.374
{\an3}Perfect.
Perfect.

11:06.457 --> 11:07.917
So you got plans
for the weekend?

11:08.000 --> 11:09.168
Are you kidding?

11:09.251 --> 11:10.795
If I don't start
building up some momentum,

11:10.878 --> 11:11.921
I'll forget why I'm here.

11:12.004 --> 11:14.757
Well, um...

11:14.840 --> 11:16.217
I don't have any plans either.

11:16.300 --> 11:17.301
{\an1}So, uh,

11:17.385 --> 11:21.055
if you need any help,
I'll be around all weekend.

11:21.138 --> 11:22.431
Thanks.

11:22.515 --> 11:24.475
I may take you up on that.

11:24.558 --> 11:26.018
Let's not tell Kelly.

11:35.486 --> 11:37.321
Donna, you think coral
is too light for fall?

11:37.405 --> 11:38.948
Definitely.

11:39.031 --> 11:40.783
Yeah, just do French.

11:40.866 --> 11:43.786
That's always safe.

11:43.869 --> 11:46.080
{\an3}You know, if I
didn't bribe you

11:46.163 --> 11:48.374
{\an3}with a manicure once a
week, I'd never see you.

11:48.457 --> 11:50.793
Well, you'll never guess
what I'm doing this afternoon.

11:52.837 --> 11:54.505
What?

11:54.588 --> 11:57.508
I'm going to the first tryouts
for the Rose Court.

11:57.591 --> 12:01.137
The Tournament of Roses
Royal Court?

12:01.220 --> 12:03.431
Mom, how many others are there?

12:03.514 --> 12:05.391
Well, for someone

12:05.474 --> 12:08.310
who has as much homework
as you say you have

12:08.394 --> 12:09.812
that sounds pretty frivolous.

12:09.895 --> 12:14.150
What was being a debutante about
last year?

12:14.233 --> 12:15.443
{\an1}Academic
enrichment?

12:15.526 --> 12:17.027
No, that was different.

12:17.111 --> 12:19.780
If you'd have been serious about
fulfilling your obligations,

12:19.864 --> 12:21.323
{\an3}you would have taken
yourself out of school

12:21.407 --> 12:22.533
for a semester.

12:22.616 --> 12:24.785
Besides, a debutante
does not compete.

12:24.869 --> 12:26.120
What's wrong with competition?

12:26.203 --> 12:28.122
Honey, I'm just...

12:28.205 --> 12:30.499
{\an3}I'm just looking out
for your feelings.

12:30.583 --> 12:32.626
{\an3}I don't want you to
be disappointed.

12:35.379 --> 12:37.339
I am so sick of this.

12:37.423 --> 12:39.175
{\an1}You know
I'm never good enough,

12:39.258 --> 12:40.384
I'm never pretty enough for you.

12:40.468 --> 12:43.179
I mean, how could I possibly
get chosen for anything, right?

12:43.262 --> 12:44.430
Donna, I never said that.

12:46.432 --> 12:48.559
Fine, you do
whatever you want to do.

12:48.642 --> 12:50.644
Don't listen to your mother.

12:50.728 --> 12:54.482
I just don't understand you
that's all.

12:54.565 --> 12:56.317
I thought you'd get
a big kick out of this.

12:56.400 --> 12:58.402
Well, I guess
that makes two of us.

12:58.486 --> 13:00.529
'Cause I don't understand you,
either.

13:11.248 --> 13:12.583
Hi.

13:12.666 --> 13:14.126
{\an3}What's with
the helmet?

13:14.210 --> 13:16.337
I didn't know you
had a motorcycle.

13:16.420 --> 13:18.088
{\an1}I didn't know
you had a surfboard.

13:18.172 --> 13:19.423
Did you go out today?

13:19.507 --> 13:20.716
{\an1}Nah. It's flat.
No waves.

13:20.799 --> 13:22.760
So c'mon, let's go.

13:22.843 --> 13:24.512
I can't. I have school.

13:24.595 --> 13:26.305
To hell with school.

13:48.285 --> 13:50.246
{\an6}DONNA:
Hey, Val, you
decided to come.

13:50.329 --> 13:51.413
Hi, guys.

13:51.497 --> 13:52.248
What are you
doing here?

13:52.331 --> 13:53.332
{\an3}Well, I had to see
this for myself.

13:53.415 --> 13:56.085
{\an1}Besides, you said it was
the party of the year, right?

13:56.168 --> 13:58.087
Hey, the more
the merrier.

13:58.170 --> 13:59.672
{\an1}I don't know how merry
it's gonna be.

13:59.755 --> 14:01.423
{\an1}You're the only one
who has a date, Donna.

14:01.507 --> 14:04.426
Listen, Kel, I'm really sorry
about the Colin thing.

14:04.510 --> 14:07.054
I tried to convince him to take
the night off and go.

14:07.137 --> 14:08.222
What the hell.

14:08.305 --> 14:10.599
How hard can it be to find
a couple of guys in tuxedos

14:10.683 --> 14:12.101
who want to come
to a free party?

14:12.184 --> 14:14.270
{\an1}Ladies...

14:14.353 --> 14:15.604
Ladies, may I have
your attention, please?

14:15.688 --> 14:17.606
{\an1}Thank you.

14:17.690 --> 14:19.608
{\an1}Each of you have
been given a number

14:19.692 --> 14:22.611
and from now on, throughout
the entire selection process,

14:22.695 --> 14:25.489
that is how the judges
will know you.

14:25.573 --> 14:27.366
So, when the group is called
with your number in it,

14:27.449 --> 14:28.909
it will be time for your review

14:28.993 --> 14:30.286
in front of the selection
committee.

14:30.369 --> 14:32.663
And now, for anybody
who is interested,

14:32.746 --> 14:34.331
uh, while you wait,

14:34.415 --> 14:36.542
I will be leading a tour
through the Tournament House.

14:40.796 --> 14:42.172
Good afternoon.

14:42.256 --> 14:43.465
I'm number 263.

14:43.549 --> 14:44.633
I live in San Marino

14:44.717 --> 14:46.635
{\an3}and I'm very pleased
to meet you all.

14:47.845 --> 14:49.471
{\an1}Thank you.

14:49.555 --> 14:50.764
Why doesn't she
just tell them

14:50.848 --> 14:52.308
{\an3}what they really
want to hear.

14:52.391 --> 14:54.310
{\an3}Hi, my measurements
are...

14:54.393 --> 14:56.312
You know, Susan,

14:56.395 --> 14:58.981
{\an1}no one is insulting
these women,

14:59.064 --> 15:00.941
or embarrassing them,
or humiliating them.

15:01.025 --> 15:02.818
{\an1}This is an American
tradition.

15:02.901 --> 15:04.445
So were minstrel shows,

15:04.528 --> 15:06.363
{\an3}but you don't exactly see men
running around in blackface

15:06.447 --> 15:09.325
{\an3}getting down on one knee and
singing "Mammy" anymore.

15:09.408 --> 15:10.868
{\an1}You probably don't
like football, either.

15:10.951 --> 15:13.495
Too violent.

15:13.579 --> 15:14.496
What about cheerleaders?

15:14.580 --> 15:16.290
Too cheerful.

15:16.373 --> 15:17.708
{\an1}You know
what your problem is?

15:17.791 --> 15:19.168
No. Why don't
you tell me.

15:19.251 --> 15:20.294
You criticize

15:20.377 --> 15:22.171
just for the sake
of being critical.

15:22.254 --> 15:24.381
{\an1}It's elitist,
not to mention unattractive.

15:24.465 --> 15:25.633
Well, as an elitist,

15:25.716 --> 15:27.676
{\an3}do you know what I have
to say to that?

15:27.760 --> 15:29.386
What?

15:30.429 --> 15:32.431
I'm rubber, you're glue.

15:33.682 --> 15:35.934
And names will never hurt me.

15:49.031 --> 15:51.200
That's Bruno,

15:51.283 --> 15:52.951
{\an1}think we can
lose him?

15:53.035 --> 15:55.746
Yeah, hang on.

16:16.141 --> 16:18.060
The Tournament House was
originally

16:18.143 --> 16:19.895
the Pasadena home
of the Wrigley family,

16:19.978 --> 16:21.522
{\an1}this is...

16:21.605 --> 16:23.357
{\an3}Donna, you grew up in a
house just like this.

16:23.440 --> 16:24.400
I know.

16:24.483 --> 16:26.402
{\an1}I think we had the same
wallpaper.

16:26.485 --> 16:29.405
{\an3}This house is a little
too conservative for me.

16:29.488 --> 16:32.408
{\an1}When you sign on
to the Rose Court,

16:32.491 --> 16:35.077
{\an1}I guarantee you get a chastity
belt with the roses.

16:35.160 --> 16:35.911
Clare!

16:35.994 --> 16:36.912
And over here,

16:36.995 --> 16:39.206
{\an1}in this case, are some
of the tiaras that were worn

16:39.289 --> 16:40.708
{\an3}by the Rose Queen
throughout the years.

16:40.791 --> 16:42.418
Oh, look at these.

16:42.501 --> 16:43.460
They're beautiful.

16:43.544 --> 16:45.754
{\an3}I used to make tiaras like
these for my dolls.

16:45.838 --> 16:47.381
You're kidding, right?

16:47.464 --> 16:50.759
Oh, you didn't grow up
in Southern California.

16:50.843 --> 16:52.803
The Rose Queen was
a very big deal.

16:52.886 --> 16:54.596
My Barbie won every year.

16:54.680 --> 16:57.015
So did mine.

16:58.684 --> 17:01.603
And this,
this is the rose garden,

17:01.687 --> 17:05.733
where hundreds of varieties of
roses are cultivated every year.

17:08.861 --> 17:10.820
Well, I have to admit,

17:10.904 --> 17:13.115
this is really beautiful.

17:13.198 --> 17:15.451
Can you imagine actually getting
picked to be in the Rose Court

17:15.534 --> 17:17.661
and getting to ride in that
parade on New Year's Day?

17:17.744 --> 17:18.619
Donna, you're not

17:18.704 --> 17:20.622
{\an1}actually getting serious
about this, are you?

17:20.705 --> 17:21.790
Why shouldn't I?

17:21.874 --> 17:23.625
I mean, I have just
as good a chance

17:23.709 --> 17:25.502
{\an4}as anyone else here.
VALERIE:
Wake up, Donna.

17:25.586 --> 17:27.796
There's a thousand girls here
and only seven slots.

17:27.880 --> 17:28.964
I know.

17:29.048 --> 17:30.299
But I can dream, can't I?

17:30.382 --> 17:32.176
{\an3}CLARE:
No offense, Don.

17:32.259 --> 17:34.428
{\an3}But to me it sounds more
like a nightmare.

17:34.511 --> 17:35.304
That's because

17:35.387 --> 17:37.639
{\an1}you're not Felice Martin's
little daughter.

17:37.723 --> 17:40.309
{\an1}Donna was born
to be a Rose Princess.

17:40.392 --> 17:42.311
{\an1}VALERIE:
Well, I'm finished.

17:42.394 --> 17:44.563
{\an1}I'm outta here,
guys.

17:46.565 --> 17:49.276
{\an6}Well, if it isn't my
favorite wannabe
princesses.

17:49.359 --> 17:50.152
Hey, Brandon.

17:50.235 --> 17:51.195
{\an1}So you're gonna
put my name in the paper?

17:51.278 --> 17:53.614
{\an3}You're a number now, Donna,
don't you forget it.

17:53.697 --> 17:54.865
You know, Susan,

17:54.948 --> 17:57.493
{\an1}they don't give them numbers
to dehumanize them.

17:57.576 --> 17:59.828
{\an1}They merely do it
to prevent favoritism

17:59.912 --> 18:02.039
{\an1}or nepotism
or any other ism.

18:02.122 --> 18:03.123
{\an1}DONNA:
That's right.

18:03.207 --> 18:04.666
Number 675
and proud of it.

18:04.750 --> 18:06.335
Where's Valerie?

18:06.418 --> 18:07.336
She's already finished.

18:07.419 --> 18:09.505
LESLIE:
Number 674!

18:09.588 --> 18:12.174
Oh, ooh, I'm next,
I'm next.

18:12.257 --> 18:13.467
{\an3}Good luck.

18:13.550 --> 18:14.843
{\an3}Thank you.
Stand up.

18:14.927 --> 18:16.053
You, too.

18:21.600 --> 18:23.352
Hi.

18:23.435 --> 18:25.062
I'm number 675.

18:25.145 --> 18:27.856
{\an1}I'm a native
of Southern California.

18:27.940 --> 18:31.860
And I'm a Liberal Arts major
at California University;

18:31.944 --> 18:35.364
and I have seen every
single Rose Parade

18:35.447 --> 18:37.199
ever since I can remember.

18:37.282 --> 18:39.326
It's a great tradition

18:39.409 --> 18:42.579
and I would be honored
to be part of it.

18:42.663 --> 18:45.040
Thank you, 675.

18:45.124 --> 18:46.208
You're very lovely.

18:46.291 --> 18:48.293
Thank you.

18:52.631 --> 18:54.716
{\an1}Oh, I think so.
Yeah.

19:10.941 --> 19:12.901
{\an3}Wow. That was
some ride.

19:12.985 --> 19:15.112
{\an3}Do you think we
lost Bruno?

19:15.195 --> 19:16.905
I think we lost Bruno.

19:16.989 --> 19:20.576
{\an3}You know, that was my first
time on a motorcycle.

19:20.659 --> 19:22.494
So, what'd you think?

19:23.495 --> 19:26.415
I thought, it was...

19:26.498 --> 19:29.251
sexy.

19:29.334 --> 19:31.044
I want to drive it.

19:31.128 --> 19:33.380
Oh, be careful.

19:33.463 --> 19:34.464
{\an3}Relax.

19:34.548 --> 19:36.091
I'll be fine.

19:36.174 --> 19:38.302
Are you sure?

19:38.385 --> 19:40.929
Okay, which one's the gas?

19:41.013 --> 19:44.099
{\an1}Okay, this is the gas
right here.

19:44.182 --> 19:46.768
What else do I
need to know?

19:46.852 --> 19:48.770
That's your clutch.

19:48.854 --> 19:50.272
This is a gear shift.

19:50.355 --> 19:51.940
And that's a brake.

19:52.024 --> 19:54.276
{\an3}Do I need to, uh, turn
the key to start it?

19:54.359 --> 19:56.028
Turn a key? No.

19:56.111 --> 19:58.071
{\an5}This one you gotta
kick start.
You mean

19:58.155 --> 19:59.615
like this?

20:00.365 --> 20:03.493
{\an1}Uh, yeah,
like that.

20:03.577 --> 20:05.495
{\an1}Hey...

20:05.579 --> 20:07.456
(tires screeching)

20:28.143 --> 20:30.020
I lied.

20:30.103 --> 20:31.480
Yeah.

20:31.563 --> 20:35.150
{\an1}Where did you ever learn
to ride like that?

20:35.233 --> 20:38.528
Well, my father always
wanted a son.

20:38.612 --> 20:40.530
Well...

20:40.614 --> 20:43.533
personally speaking,

20:43.617 --> 20:45.619
I'm very glad that, uh,

20:45.702 --> 20:48.121
{\an1}your father didn't get
what he wanted.

21:06.431 --> 21:09.434
{\an3}Boy, I thought you were
never gonna do that.

21:41.800 --> 21:43.719
{\an1}Hey, you.

21:43.802 --> 21:45.387
{\an3}Hi.

21:45.470 --> 21:47.723
When are you gonna take a break
and give me a kiss?

21:47.806 --> 21:49.725
Am I glad to see you.
Hmm.

21:49.808 --> 21:51.727
You know in New York,

21:51.810 --> 21:53.770
{\an3}you got time off
for good behavior.

21:53.854 --> 21:55.230
You got that wrong.

21:55.313 --> 21:57.399
{\an1}I took time off
for bad behavior with you.

21:57.482 --> 21:59.776
Any chance I could get some more
of that?

21:59.860 --> 22:01.570
I like it when you're bad.

22:04.489 --> 22:06.408
{\an3}You know,

22:06.491 --> 22:09.745
I don't have to go to this
ball thing tomorrow night.

22:09.828 --> 22:12.789
{\an3}I could stay here
and help you,

22:12.873 --> 22:14.875
and kiss you and...

22:14.958 --> 22:16.960
{\an3}help you,
and kiss you.

22:19.004 --> 22:20.922
{\an1}Problem is, when I'm kissing,
I'm not painting.

22:21.006 --> 22:23.592
Tell you what.

22:23.675 --> 22:25.927
{\an1}Go to the party,
have a great time,

22:26.011 --> 22:27.554
{\an1}and, uh,
we'll hook up later.

22:27.637 --> 22:30.474
All right, but I would've loved
to see you in your tux.

22:30.557 --> 22:32.059
I'll wear it to bed.

22:32.142 --> 22:34.061
You got a deal.

22:34.144 --> 22:36.021
{\an3}It's okay, my brother
will take me.

22:36.104 --> 22:37.731
He'll do anything for me.

22:37.814 --> 22:39.441
No way, I'm not wearing a tux.

22:39.524 --> 22:40.650
David, come on.

22:40.734 --> 22:42.277
{\an1}Everybody's going
to be there.

22:42.360 --> 22:43.445
I mean, it'll be great.

22:43.528 --> 22:46.114
It'll be music
and food and girls.

22:46.198 --> 22:47.616
Lots of girls.

22:47.699 --> 22:50.410
{\an1}Probably, like,
a thousand girls.

22:50.494 --> 22:51.286
And they'll all be gorgeous.

22:51.369 --> 22:53.580
And they'll all have dates.

22:53.663 --> 22:57.084
Well, at least one of them will
be there with her stepbrother.

22:58.085 --> 22:59.920
{\an1}NAT:
Hey, David?

23:00.003 --> 23:01.546
You got a phone call.
It's your mother.

23:01.630 --> 23:03.298
(sighs)

23:03.381 --> 23:05.008
How'd she track me down here?

23:05.092 --> 23:06.093
{\an3}Oh.

23:06.176 --> 23:07.260
Uh, Kelly,
I forgot to tell you,

23:07.344 --> 23:09.638
I'm supposed to play cards
with my mom tomorrow night.

23:09.721 --> 23:12.432
Oh, well, at least
that's an acceptable excuse.

23:12.516 --> 23:15.227
{\an3}No, actually,
you're the excuse.

23:15.310 --> 23:16.645
I'd much rather wear a tux

23:16.728 --> 23:18.772
than, uh, play another hand
of gin with my mom.

23:18.855 --> 23:21.108
(lively chatter
and laughter)

23:22.067 --> 23:23.819
Hello.

23:25.904 --> 23:27.280
{\an1}(sighs)

23:27.364 --> 23:28.490
Wrong, wrong, wrong.

23:28.573 --> 23:30.408
{\an1}Clare, if you gave me
a multiple choice,

23:30.492 --> 23:32.452
{\an1}at least I'd have
half a chance.

23:32.536 --> 23:34.287
Steve, I don't think
you get it, okay?

23:34.371 --> 23:35.831
You see, math is the one subject

23:35.914 --> 23:38.208
where you kind of can't
take the easy way out.

23:38.291 --> 23:39.459
{\an1}Oh, yeah?

23:39.543 --> 23:41.419
Then why did they invent
calculators, huh?

23:41.503 --> 23:43.588
I'm starting
to feel really sorry for you,

23:43.672 --> 23:46.341
so I'm going to ask you
an easy question, okay?

23:46.424 --> 23:47.843
{\an3}If I have

23:47.926 --> 23:50.345
two tickets to a Royal Ball,

23:50.428 --> 23:52.514
but I'm only using one,

23:52.597 --> 23:54.349
how many do
I have left?

23:54.432 --> 23:55.559
Uh, one ticket.

23:55.642 --> 23:57.811
Yay! You got it right.
Congratulations.

23:57.894 --> 24:00.397
Great. So what do I win?

24:00.480 --> 24:02.774
A date with me.

24:06.444 --> 24:09.197
(crickets chirping)

24:13.451 --> 24:15.620
All right, man,
move your feet.

24:18.123 --> 24:20.208
If your mom could
only see you now.

24:20.292 --> 24:21.918
{\an3}Yeah.

24:22.002 --> 24:24.379
{\an3}So, what's this
Marchette kid like anyway?

24:24.462 --> 24:26.214
She's all right.

24:26.298 --> 24:27.549
She's cute as hell.

24:27.632 --> 24:28.592
Is she?

24:28.675 --> 24:30.468
Like you hadn't noticed.

24:30.552 --> 24:32.512
I don't want to talk
about Tony Marchette

24:32.596 --> 24:34.389
or his daughter, all right?

24:34.472 --> 24:36.016
Oh, that's a change.

24:36.099 --> 24:37.434
What's going on?

24:37.517 --> 24:38.560
{\an3}You falling
for her?

24:38.643 --> 24:41.021
So?

24:41.104 --> 24:42.230
(laughs)

24:42.314 --> 24:44.232
Like I didn't see
that one coming.

24:44.316 --> 24:45.442
Don't worry about it.

24:45.525 --> 24:46.568
I know what I'm doing.

24:46.651 --> 24:48.195
Then would you mind telling me?

24:51.281 --> 24:52.657
What's this?

24:52.741 --> 24:55.410
{\an1}It's the key
to a safety deposit box.

24:55.493 --> 24:56.536
There's some stuff in there.

24:56.620 --> 24:59.456
Anything happens to me,
you, uh, get it to the FBI.

24:59.539 --> 25:02.083
Fine. Just don't ask me
to write your eulogy.

25:02.167 --> 25:04.085
Hey, I don't plan on dying.

25:04.169 --> 25:05.587
(laughs)

25:05.670 --> 25:07.130
Neither did your father, Dylan,

25:07.214 --> 25:08.924
but if the government
couldn't protect Jack,

25:09.007 --> 25:11.092
what makes you think
you can protect yourself?

25:11.176 --> 25:13.386
Jack knew the odds, so do I.

25:13.470 --> 25:15.555
Just watch your back.

25:16.890 --> 25:17.933
{\an1}STEVE:
Brandon, get in here.

25:18.016 --> 25:19.935
I got an emergency.

25:20.018 --> 25:22.062
{\an3}(sighs)

25:22.145 --> 25:23.355
{\an1}Steve, what's
the matter?

25:23.438 --> 25:26.608
I'm in live chat, and no matter
what key I hit, nothing happens.

25:26.691 --> 25:28.443
I'm locked out.
It's broken or something.

25:28.526 --> 25:29.986
{\an1}Steve, you unplugged
the keyboard, that's all.

25:30.070 --> 25:31.238
{\an1}Ah.
There you go.

25:31.321 --> 25:32.447
Thank you very much.

25:32.530 --> 25:33.615
What are you
doing, Steve,

25:33.698 --> 25:35.492
{\an5}hacking into the
National Security
Network in there?

25:35.575 --> 25:37.118
{\an1}It's-It's nothing,
really.

25:37.202 --> 25:39.079
Why don't you guys go back
to doing what you were doing?

25:39.162 --> 25:41.248
No, no, no. What the...
What the hell is that?

25:41.331 --> 25:42.791
{\an1}Steve? "Dear...
Dear Cuddles...?"

25:42.874 --> 25:44.793
Cyber sex, the last frontier.

25:44.876 --> 25:46.920
{\an6}DYLAN:
Ooh, Steve, I
knew you were

25:47.003 --> 25:48.463
{\an3}computer illiterate,
I did not know

25:48.546 --> 25:50.298
{\an3}you were desperate,
however. Look...

25:50.382 --> 25:52.425
Why don't you just blow in,
okay?

25:52.509 --> 25:54.427
I'm leaving.

25:54.511 --> 25:55.595
Probably a good move.

25:55.679 --> 25:57.764
See you, Dylan.

25:57.847 --> 26:01.017
{\an1}So, uh, how's it going
there, Tenderheart?

26:01.101 --> 26:02.477
I'm meeting Cuddles
tomorrow night. Mm!

26:02.560 --> 26:04.980
I thought you were going
to the ball with Clare.

26:05.063 --> 26:07.649
{\an3}Well, I am, but after the
ball, I'll ditch the witch,

26:07.732 --> 26:10.277
{\an3}cut her broom in half
so she can't follow me,

26:10.360 --> 26:12.821
{\an3}and then I'll have a date
with my digital dream girl.

26:12.904 --> 26:14.322
Sounds like a plan.

26:14.406 --> 26:15.615
{\an3}Oh, this is
serious, man.

26:15.699 --> 26:16.825
This is serious.

26:16.908 --> 26:18.201
This girl's fantastic.

26:18.285 --> 26:20.537
{\an3}She's fun, she's
sexy, she's sensitive,

26:20.620 --> 26:23.415
and unless she looks like
a hockey stick with hair,

26:23.498 --> 26:24.833
I'm off the market.

26:24.916 --> 26:26.626
{\an1}Well, I wish you luck,
my friend.

26:26.710 --> 26:28.295
Thanks, pal.

26:28.378 --> 26:30.046
(keyboard keys clacking)

26:30.130 --> 26:32.340
(crowd chatter)

26:32.424 --> 26:34.467
{\an3}And unless anybody else
has anything else,

26:34.551 --> 26:35.719
{\an3}that's all
she wrote.

26:35.802 --> 26:37.137
{\an3}Great. Get
out of here.

26:37.220 --> 26:38.513
{\an5}See you tomorrow.
WOMAN:
Okay.

26:38.596 --> 26:40.348
{\an3}Same bat time,
same bat channel.

26:40.432 --> 26:41.349
Great meeting, boss.

26:41.433 --> 26:42.559
Very informative.

26:42.642 --> 26:43.852
You were listening?

26:43.935 --> 26:45.729
I could have sworn
I saw you doodling.

26:45.812 --> 26:47.689
{\an3}Well, it wasn't
that good.

26:47.772 --> 26:50.358
{\an1}That's the first honest thing
you've said since we met.

26:50.442 --> 26:52.527
You know, I was thinking, since
we're both covering the ball,

26:52.610 --> 26:54.529
{\an3}maybe you and I
should go together.

26:54.612 --> 26:55.989
I suppose we could do that.

26:56.072 --> 26:57.407
(laughs)

26:57.490 --> 26:59.743
{\an1}What's the matter,
couldn't get a date?

26:59.826 --> 27:01.661
{\an5}(both laugh)
I'll let that
one slide.

27:01.745 --> 27:03.413
{\an3}I'll pick you
up around 8:00?

27:03.496 --> 27:05.498
I said I'd go with you.

27:05.582 --> 27:07.417
I didn't mean in the same car.

27:07.500 --> 27:09.169
I'll meet you there.

27:09.252 --> 27:11.046
I'm sure you'll recognize me.

27:11.129 --> 27:13.798
Yeah, you'll be the one
with the great attitude.

27:16.217 --> 27:18.887
KELLY:
<i>Donna, this is fantastic.</i>

27:18.970 --> 27:20.680
Why aren't you
more excited?

27:20.764 --> 27:22.098
{\an3}Who would
have thought?

27:22.182 --> 27:24.100
You made the cut!

27:24.184 --> 27:25.393
Certainly not my mother.

27:25.477 --> 27:27.520
{\an1}She didn't even want me
to try out.

27:27.604 --> 27:30.565
Why is she such a downer?

27:32.609 --> 27:33.443
You know, Kel,

27:33.526 --> 27:37.364
{\an1}every time I try anything,
she puts it down.

27:37.447 --> 27:39.407
{\an1}How come she can
make me feel so horrible?

27:39.491 --> 27:41.284
Because she's your mother.

27:41.368 --> 27:42.660
It comes with the territory.

27:44.579 --> 27:46.664
{\an1}You know, I really
want to do this.

27:46.748 --> 27:49.084
{\an1}I mean, I know
you guys aren't into it,

27:49.167 --> 27:51.086
but I just... I think it's fun.

27:51.169 --> 27:52.295
You know what, Donna?

27:52.379 --> 27:54.422
{\an3}That is what makes
the world go around.

27:54.506 --> 27:56.257
{\an3}Don't worry about what
other people think.

27:56.341 --> 27:57.592
{\an3}Go for it.

27:57.675 --> 27:59.260
We're behind you 100%.

27:59.344 --> 28:00.470
Thank you.

28:00.553 --> 28:01.304
You're welcome.

28:01.388 --> 28:03.431
{\an6}DAVID:
All right, guys,
I'm all set.

28:03.515 --> 28:04.432
Come on in.

28:04.516 --> 28:06.559
{\an1}(hums)

28:09.145 --> 28:11.189
(sniffling)

28:13.525 --> 28:16.319
(sighs)

28:16.403 --> 28:17.987
Don't even think it.

28:18.071 --> 28:20.949
Well, maybe the party
has a beach theme.

28:21.032 --> 28:23.284
{\an3}(laughing):
Oh, no. Take those off.

28:23.368 --> 28:25.161
I'm just kidding. It's a joke.

28:25.245 --> 28:27.622
Uh, plaid is not funny.

28:27.705 --> 28:29.833
{\an1}RAY:
Anyone home?

28:29.916 --> 28:31.501
Uh, yeah, we're back here.

28:31.584 --> 28:34.087
Come on, I'll teach you
how to tie that bowtie.

28:52.063 --> 28:53.273
You knew about this party.

28:53.356 --> 28:56.943
I know, but Jerry Korman made me
an offer that I can't refuse.

28:57.026 --> 28:58.319
What offer?

28:58.403 --> 29:00.613
Remember my little fan?

Jessica?

29:02.240 --> 29:04.033

29:04.117 --> 29:06.327

what she wanted,

29:06.411 --> 29:08.329
she said... me.

29:08.413 --> 29:09.581
You?

29:09.664 --> 29:11.332
{\an3}I either headline
her birthday party,

29:43.114 --> 29:45.825
Well, I told you
I'd hang out and help you.

41:12.970 --> 41:14.388
{\an3}she's sitting
over there.

41:26.984 --> 41:28.527
Say it isn't so.

41:28.611 --> 41:30.446
(laughs)

41:31.489 --> 41:33.240
(laughs)

41:33.324 --> 41:35.242
Cuddles!

41:37.828 --> 41:39.079
Tenderheart?

41:39.163 --> 41:41.415
I can't believe
this is happening to me.

41:41.498 --> 41:43.751
Oh, God, this is a nightmare.

41:43.834 --> 41:46.212
And to think I was ready
to give up my freedom for you.

41:46.295 --> 41:48.547
Uh, you're not the only one
that's disappointed here,

41:48.631 --> 41:50.257
okay, Steve?

41:50.341 --> 41:51.383
Mr. Sensitive,

41:51.467 --> 41:53.594
Mr. "Love Makes Me Cry."

41:53.677 --> 41:55.387
Oh, please, I thought
I was coming here

41:55.471 --> 41:57.431
to meet Mother Teresa
in Claudia Schiffer's body.

41:57.514 --> 41:58.891
So I stretched the truth a bit.

41:58.974 --> 42:00.768
"A bit"?

42:00.851 --> 42:02.436
Stuff it, all right?

42:02.519 --> 42:03.437
Well, I didn't lie
about everything.

42:03.520 --> 42:05.272
I am free tonight.

42:05.356 --> 42:06.982
Me, too.

42:07.066 --> 42:10.486
I had a, um, a date,
but I-I ditched him.

42:12.529 --> 42:13.906
Can I buy you a cup of coffee?

42:13.989 --> 42:15.282
{\an3}Cuddles.

42:15.366 --> 42:17.034
Yeah.

42:18.285 --> 42:20.579
Why not?

42:20.663 --> 42:22.748
Tenderheart.

42:24.375 --> 42:25.834
(both laugh)

42:29.338 --> 42:32.007
{\an3}I really appreciate you coming
to visit my mom with me.

42:32.091 --> 42:33.759
Hey, no problem.

42:33.842 --> 42:35.970
{\an1}I know what it's like
to worry about a parent.

42:41.308 --> 42:43.477
{\an1}Oh, no.

42:43.560 --> 42:44.979
I don't have
a good feeling about this.

42:45.062 --> 42:46.105
This is my mom's apartment.

42:50.859 --> 42:53.362
(indistinct radio transmission)

42:53.445 --> 42:56.490
Excuse me, Officer?

42:56.573 --> 42:58.492
Officer, please.

42:58.576 --> 43:00.786
Excuse me.
I need to get by.

43:00.869 --> 43:02.663
{\an1}What happened?
Stand back, sir.

43:02.746 --> 43:04.331
No-no-no-- my mom lives
in this building.

43:04.415 --> 43:06.500
I'm sorry sir.
That's her, that's her.

43:06.583 --> 43:07.418
That's my mom!
Excuse me.

43:07.501 --> 43:09.169
Excuse me, that's my mom.
What happened?

43:09.253 --> 43:10.170
Sorry, kid, attempted suicide.

43:10.254 --> 43:12.172
{\an3}What?!
David, just go.

43:12.256 --> 43:13.507
{\an3}Go, go, go!
Can I go with her?

43:13.590 --> 43:15.342
Yeah, sure. Hop in.

43:20.097 --> 43:22.099
(siren wails)

43:28.772 --> 43:30.816
