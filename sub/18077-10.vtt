In 1972,
a crack commando unit...

00:35.716 --> 00:37.479
was sent to prison
by a military court...

00:37.551 --> 00:38.950
for a crime
they didn't commit.

00:39.019 --> 00:40.213
These men promptly escaped...

00:40.287 --> 00:41.879
from a maximum-security
stockade...

00:41.955 --> 00:43.513
to the Los Angeles

some unfinished work
to be done.

03:22.249 --> 03:24.547
We just finished working
10 straight hours.

03:25.051 --> 03:27.815
Company rule says

more than 10 hours.

we change the rules.

there won't be a trace...

05:34.714 --> 05:36.341

05:36.816 --> 05:38.977
Kalish was

06:37.577 --> 06:42.037
Mr. Lee said
that you were
extremely cautious.

06:43.383 --> 06:46.409
But let me assure you,
we do not work
for the military...

06:46.486 --> 06:48.613
and we are sincere...

06:48.955 --> 06:51.480
in our plea for help
from the A-Team.

06:53.993 --> 06:55.790
As l told Mr. Lee...

06:56.863 --> 06:58.922
our oil company
is engaged...

06:58.998 --> 07:02.058
in a joint venture
with the government
of San Marcos...

07:02.135 --> 07:04.535
to build
a hydraulic power plant.

07:04.938 --> 07:06.269
And when
it's completed...

07:06.339 --> 07:09.900
it will provide more than
half of the electrical power
to South America.

07:09.976 --> 07:11.375
Now we currently...

07:11.478 --> 07:15.005
employ over
600 workers
on the project.

07:15.148 --> 07:19.141
We have erected
a temporary city
on the site...

07:19.285 --> 07:21.185
to house those workers.

07:22.122 --> 07:24.556
lt's locally known
as Rivertown...

07:25.024 --> 07:28.084
due to its close proximity
to the Rio Blanco.

07:28.361 --> 07:30.261
The problem is
in the past year...

07:30.330 --> 07:35.290
over 20 men have been lost
to industrial accidents
and explosions...

07:36.536 --> 07:39.004
and their bodies
have never been recovered.

07:39.072 --> 07:41.404
Now part of our contract
with the government
of San Marcos...

07:41.474 --> 07:44.068
is to provide
the security for Rivertown.

07:44.144 --> 07:45.702
Now it's a monumental job...

07:45.779 --> 07:47.838
and that's why we've
sent for the A-Team.

07:48.214 --> 07:50.148

you need them bad.

07:53.019 --> 07:54.509
Why are you
telling me all this?

07:54.621 --> 07:57.317

to go in...

you're at a 1 40,
you're in big trouble.

happened to the other sheriff
they sent to Rivertown?

09:23.409 --> 09:26.105

as they say.

''Sounds like a challenge.''

to pay our fee.

this trick before.

your burger...

then take Face's burger.

10:21.301 --> 10:24.793

is the one that got
the sleeping powder in it.

13:51.310 --> 13:52.607
(Boyle)
The old check
and raise you.

13:52.678 --> 13:54.270
We got a sandbagger
over here, guys.

All right, l call you.
l call you.

13:58.317 --> 13:59.443
There you go.

13:59.585 --> 14:00.813
(man #1)
l'm in.

14:00.887 --> 14:03.378
(Flint)
Aren't you gonna call
on a pair of deuces?

14:03.456 --> 14:04.980
(Boyle)
Well, l don't wanna
rush you, pal.

14:05.057 --> 14:07.890
l got three ducks here,
three deuces.

14:08.161 --> 14:09.287
(Boyle)
Boyle wins again, huh?

14:09.362 --> 14:10.351
[gun fires]

14:13.232 --> 14:14.324
Who the hell are you?

14:14.400 --> 14:15.628
l'm the new sheriff.

14:15.701 --> 14:17.498
My name is Hannibal Smith.

14:17.637 --> 14:19.036
But you can call me ''sir.''

14:19.105 --> 14:21.096
You know who l am?
Yeah, your name's Boyle.

14:21.174 --> 14:23.665
You're the main pig slop
around here.

14:24.210 --> 14:26.735
There'll be no more gambling.

14:31.584 --> 14:34.178
You and l
better have a talk, mister.

14:35.087 --> 14:36.076
Sure.

14:50.369 --> 14:53.099
There seems to be
some misunderstanding, Smith.

14:53.639 --> 14:57.166
You see,
well, l run this town.

14:57.243 --> 14:59.108
The workers
listen to me and...

14:59.445 --> 15:02.209
well, they're happy
and everything runs
real smooth.

15:02.281 --> 15:04.715
Now, as for
the sheriffs around here,
well...

15:12.091 --> 15:15.583
l take care of them,
and they look the other way.

15:15.661 --> 15:19.256
Wrong.
l run the town.

15:19.632 --> 15:20.963
No gambling.

15:22.101 --> 15:23.864
No drinking
before shift...

15:23.936 --> 15:25.494
and l never look
the other way.

15:27.940 --> 15:30.431
lt's unfortunate
that we don't see
eye to eye.

15:33.179 --> 15:34.806
Hey, where
do you think you're--

15:52.932 --> 15:54.456
[screaming]

15:59.739 --> 16:01.934
Freeze!
Peace Officers!

16:02.008 --> 16:03.236
Nicely put.

16:08.414 --> 16:10.405
Now, l'm gonna
put your boys away...

16:10.716 --> 16:12.775
for simple assault,
overnight.

16:13.219 --> 16:15.312
Next time,
it'll be six months...

16:15.788 --> 16:18.018
for assault
on a police officer.

16:19.959 --> 16:22.985
Sheriff's office is open
24 hours a day.

16:24.830 --> 16:26.422
Stop in anytime.

[[[Murdock humming

[imitating Jack Webb

lt's early in the AM.

16:43.015 --> 16:44.243
The city was quiet.

16:44.317 --> 16:46.410
Officer Baracus and l
had been assigned to patrol.

16:46.485 --> 16:48.043
The city was at peace
with itself...

16:48.120 --> 16:49.712
but it wasn't going to be
that way for long.

16:49.789 --> 16:52.485

that's when l go to work.

16:53.726 --> 16:54.886
You ought to

talk to yourself
like some kind of fool?

16:57.229 --> 16:58.628
l'm not talking
to myself.

16:58.698 --> 17:01.531
When you talk to yourself,
you're alone.
No one hears you.

17:01.600 --> 17:02.624
You happen to be
with me.

17:02.702 --> 17:05.034
You hear me,
therefore, l am not
talking to myself.

17:05.104 --> 17:07.698
[glass shattering]
Talk to me. Talk sense,
so l can talk back.

17:07.807 --> 17:10.275
Not all this jibber jabber,
like breaking the peace
and all that.

17:10.343 --> 17:12.277
Okay, okay, fine,

17:14.046 --> 17:15.377

B.A., you okay?

17:49.749 --> 17:51.216
Yeah, man.
Did you see who it was?

17:51.283 --> 17:53.148
Yeah, it looked like
one of Boyle's men to me.

No! Call the colonel.

Murdock, you're sure
this was one of Boyle's men?

18:04.930 --> 18:07.194
Absolutely.
lt was that guy, Lupis.

He's about 6'3'',
built like a bathtub.

18:10.970 --> 18:12.403

wanna rob here?

18:12.471 --> 18:14.496
Nobody leaves
anything valuable
in the locker.

18:14.573 --> 18:19.101
Nothing but old clothes,
letters from home
and nothing of value.

18:19.712 --> 18:21.407
''Mr. Craig Monroe.''

18:22.047 --> 18:23.241
Then we can find him.

18:23.315 --> 18:24.714
Find out what's going on.

18:24.784 --> 18:27.514

for you to do.

You want me
to pick up who?

18:50.943 --> 18:53.810
Lupis. He works for Boyle.
We saw him yesterday.

18:53.879 --> 18:56.712
Oh, yeah. That's the big one,
about 6'4'', built like
a chest of drawers?

18:56.782 --> 18:59.410
Yeah, that's the guy, guy.
And you be careful.
He almost killed B.A.

18:59.485 --> 19:01.544
He's at least 6'5'',
240.

19:01.620 --> 19:02.609
Now...

19:03.989 --> 19:05.581
l'm gonna
check out his office.

19:05.658 --> 19:09.253
You check out his house.
lf the guy Lupis shows,

Wait, the guy's 6'6'',
250 pounds...

and you want me to bag him.

Sure.

Well, you don't care
how l go about it,
do you, Colonel?

19:18.737 --> 19:22.264
No. Use alacrity.

No sign of him or Lupis.

What about you?

20:05.518 --> 20:06.610
No, Boyle's not home.

At least, not after
l picked it.

God, there's
someone coming.

Not unless he enters
his own place
through a window.

20:19.498 --> 20:21.022
lt might be
your guy, Lupis.

20:21.667 --> 20:23.897
Wrap him up, and l'll meet you
at the sheriff's office.

20:23.969 --> 20:26.802

before you'll....

What?

No, know what?

This Craig Monroe was killed
in a cave-in last week.

of their engineers.

doing on the work site?

And he was killed
in a tunnel...

21:28.200 --> 21:30.031
that had been closed
for two months.

21:30.102 --> 21:32.297
Are you talking
about Craig Monroe?

You better
take it easy here.
lt's....

21:35.541 --> 21:37.566
What happened?
Who hit me?

21:37.710 --> 21:39.644
You didn't see him?

21:40.045 --> 21:42.206
No, l don't remember.

21:42.281 --> 21:43.509
(Nikki)
What am l doing here?

21:43.582 --> 21:45.982
Well, you're in jail.

21:46.051 --> 21:47.348
Burglary's
a tough business...

21:47.419 --> 21:50.047
or do you always
make your entrances...

21:50.122 --> 21:52.056
through a window
like Supergirl?

21:52.124 --> 21:54.684
l'd like to hear
what you know
about Craig Monroe.

21:55.995 --> 21:57.622
Craig was my brother.

21:59.865 --> 22:02.663
Well, would you know
why your boyfriend...

22:02.735 --> 22:06.034
or one of his cronies
would want to go through
your brother's belongings?

22:06.105 --> 22:07.094
My....

22:08.240 --> 22:10.333
Oh, you mean
that pig, Boyle?

22:10.409 --> 22:14.573
That's a nice way to talk
about somebody whose house
you were found breaking into.

22:15.547 --> 22:18.311
Hey, man, how do we know
she's who she says she is?

22:18.384 --> 22:21.376
You're right. We ought to
put on the heat. You wanna
play good cop-bad cop?

22:21.453 --> 22:22.920
You wanna be
the good cop?

22:22.988 --> 22:25.183
B.A., it's time for
the Main Street patrol.

22:25.257 --> 22:26.884
Take Murdock
and stay on the radio.

22:26.959 --> 22:28.927
lf you got any problems,
call us.

22:31.397 --> 22:32.887
That bottom letter's
from me.

22:32.965 --> 22:35.024
lt's from me to Craig.
lt's the last one l wrote him.

22:35.100 --> 22:36.465
On the second page
you can see...

22:36.535 --> 22:39.060
that l wrote and said
that l'd be coming down here
to visit him...

22:39.138 --> 22:41.106
and that Dad
would be feeling better.

22:43.709 --> 22:46.837
Okay, you're his sister.
You wrote the letter.

22:47.146 --> 22:50.707
But what were you doing
snooping around Boyle's house?

22:52.551 --> 22:53.848
Well, after Craig
had been killed...

22:53.919 --> 22:56.251
l went to someone
l knew at Amco Oil.

22:56.522 --> 22:58.683
They sort of checked out
the records for me.

22:58.791 --> 23:01.089
He told me that there had been
two bad accidents down here...

23:01.160 --> 23:02.320
in the last couple
of months...

23:02.394 --> 23:05.386
so l decided
to come down here and see
what was really going on.

23:06.198 --> 23:07.495
Craig was an engineer.

23:08.100 --> 23:10.261
He never would have been
in that construction dig.

23:12.838 --> 23:14.772
l knew that Boyle
ran this place...

23:15.507 --> 23:19.603
and then l noticed a gold ring
that Boyle wears
on his little finger.

23:19.678 --> 23:21.407
Well, that was
my brother's ring.

23:21.480 --> 23:22.947
So, l decided
to play up to Boyle...

23:23.015 --> 23:24.482
and see what more
l could find out.

23:24.550 --> 23:26.745
Well, you played up
to him very nicely.

23:26.819 --> 23:28.719
You don't think
l really enjoyed that,
do you?

23:28.787 --> 23:32.553
No, but l'm sure he did.
You were all over him
like a wet burnoose.

23:33.759 --> 23:35.590
Well, l didn't
find out much.

23:35.661 --> 23:38.425
Except that l do know
that he comes to the tavern
every night.

23:38.497 --> 23:40.465
And about three times a week,
around 10:00...

23:40.532 --> 23:42.466
he leaves
and doesn't come back
until morning.

23:42.534 --> 23:44.024
So l decided
to snoop around his place...

23:44.103 --> 23:45.695
and see if l could
find out anything more...

23:45.771 --> 23:48.069
that would tell me
why Craig was in that tunnel.

23:48.140 --> 23:50.768
One of Boyle's men
was going through
your brother's possessions...

23:50.843 --> 23:52.140
in the locker.

23:53.445 --> 23:55.106
Now, we've been
through it...

23:55.280 --> 23:56.941
but maybe you could
go through his stuff...

23:57.015 --> 23:58.846
and find something
we missed.

23:58.917 --> 24:00.782
Now, whatever Boyle is up to,
it has to be more...

24:00.853 --> 24:03.321
than just ripping off lockers
and cheating at cards.

24:03.388 --> 24:04.412
Bet on it.

24:13.799 --> 24:15.130
[metal clinking]

24:18.403 --> 24:19.631
Wait here.

24:27.913 --> 24:29.244
[speaking Spanish]

24:31.984 --> 24:33.747
Things seem
to be shaping up.

24:35.988 --> 24:37.979
Two days l have been
waiting for you.

24:38.056 --> 24:39.921
Two days
without a word!

24:39.992 --> 24:41.289
Where are
the extra men
l need?

24:41.360 --> 24:42.588
(Boyle)
l told you before.

24:42.661 --> 24:44.720
There's a new sheriff
and his men
l have to deal with.

24:44.797 --> 24:47.698
You told me you could
take care of anyone
the American pigs sent down.

24:47.766 --> 24:49.529
l can.
All l need is time.

24:49.601 --> 24:52.331
Time?
l do not have time.

24:52.404 --> 24:55.032
The men, they do not
work fast enough.

24:55.541 --> 24:58.408
And the missile?
The missile is
just not completed!

24:58.944 --> 25:01.777
And l must attack
the presidential palace
in two days.

25:02.114 --> 25:03.513
l need 10 more men...

25:03.582 --> 25:06.278
and among them,
at least three
must be machinists.

25:06.351 --> 25:09.650
And l need another
explosives expert.

25:09.755 --> 25:10.915
l brought you Monroe.

25:10.989 --> 25:13.583
(Boyle)
Now he has four years training
in the United States Army.

25:13.659 --> 25:18.096
He knows more about explosives
and guidance missile designs
than any man l have.

25:18.630 --> 25:20.427
He has been doing
a good job...

25:20.732 --> 25:24.065
but he gets weaker
every day. l do not know
how long he will hang on.

25:24.136 --> 25:26.263
Well, l don't have
another man
with his background.

25:26.338 --> 25:28.306
So, you'd better
keep him alive.

25:30.909 --> 25:32.638
l brought
his medication.

25:32.711 --> 25:34.372
Here, this stuff
should do it.

25:37.282 --> 25:38.909
Craig's medication.

25:39.151 --> 25:40.413
What medication?

25:40.485 --> 25:42.146
Craig was
a borderline diabetic...

25:42.221 --> 25:43.688
and he had to take a pill
every morning.

25:43.755 --> 25:44.813
They're gone.

25:44.890 --> 25:47.859
Well, as in-house
medical advisor of this group,
l can assure you...

25:47.926 --> 25:51.225
that diabetic medication
isn't exactly in demand
on the street.

25:51.296 --> 25:53.230
Why would they
wanna take
his medication?

25:55.200 --> 25:56.690
To give it to him?

25:58.103 --> 26:00.333
Are you saying that Craig
could still be alive?

26:00.706 --> 26:04.642
l'm just trying to figure out
a reason to go and take
his particular medication.

26:04.710 --> 26:06.837
l mean, if they had
a legitimate need...

26:06.912 --> 26:09.107
they'd go to the infirmary
and get it right away.

26:09.181 --> 26:11.843
You're saying
the cave-in
was just a phony.

26:11.917 --> 26:14.044
A smoke screen
to spirit Craig away.

26:14.119 --> 26:15.108
Could be.

26:16.255 --> 26:17.847
Could very well be.

26:18.857 --> 26:20.119
[explosion]

26:24.763 --> 26:25.991
You'd better stay here.

26:26.064 --> 26:27.497
l'm--
No, no, just stay.

26:29.067 --> 26:30.329
[siren blaring]

26:34.239 --> 26:35.467
(Hannibal)
What happened?

26:35.540 --> 26:37.007
A cave-in down
in shaft number six.

26:37.075 --> 26:38.201
Anybody in there?

26:38.277 --> 26:39.938
Reeves, Gunderson,
maybe a half dozen more.

26:40.012 --> 26:42.003
They're all gone.
Look, l don't even know
why the hell...

26:42.080 --> 26:43.172
we were working
this shaft.

26:43.248 --> 26:45.978
Did this shaft close down
like number eight?

26:46.051 --> 26:48.144
Yeah, we just opened it up
again this morning.

26:48.220 --> 26:49.687
Who gave the orders
to open it up?

26:49.788 --> 26:50.846
l did.

26:52.157 --> 26:53.624
Guess l messed up.

27:02.968 --> 27:06.699
According to the company,
two of those guys who died
in that cave-in...

27:06.772 --> 27:08.672
were electrical technicians.

27:08.740 --> 27:10.230
l still don't understand...

27:10.309 --> 27:12.903
what electrical technicians
were doing
in that kind of mineshaft.

27:12.978 --> 27:14.673
Neither do l,
Murdock.

27:15.113 --> 27:17.104
(Hannibal)
We'd learn a lot
if we can just find out...

27:17.182 --> 27:19.150
where Boyle
disappears to?

27:19.518 --> 27:22.976
B.A., could you
cook up something we could
follow this scuzzbucket with?

27:23.055 --> 27:25.250
No problem,
but where we gonna
plant it?

27:25.357 --> 27:28.815
We got to get it on him
and make sure it stays there
until he makes another trip.

27:28.894 --> 27:31.692
You could plant it
on his clothes somewhere.

27:31.763 --> 27:34.493
No, Murdock, you change
your clothes every day.

27:34.566 --> 27:36.591
l do, but it didn't smell
like he did.

27:36.668 --> 27:38.295
No, B.A.'s right.

27:38.537 --> 27:41.631
Once we plant it on him,
we got to be sure
it stays on him.

27:41.974 --> 27:45.637
Now, what would he have
that he would keep on him
all the time?

27:46.211 --> 27:47.508
His lighter!

27:47.579 --> 27:49.547
His cigarette lighter,
he always has that with him.

27:49.614 --> 27:52.515
The only time he even takes it
out of his pocket
is when he plays cards.

27:52.584 --> 27:54.074
Yeah, he uses it
to cheat.

27:54.152 --> 27:55.779
How do you cheat
at cards using a lighter?

27:55.854 --> 27:58.482
lt's one of the oldest tricks
in the book.
lt's called a shiner.

27:58.557 --> 28:01.355
See, he uses
the polished surface
of the lighter as a mirror...

28:01.426 --> 28:03.018
and then he deals
over the top of it.

28:03.095 --> 28:05.029
He can tell all the cards
that everybody's got.

28:05.097 --> 28:07.327
B.A., how small a transmitter
could you make for us?

28:07.399 --> 28:10.926
About the size of a button.
lt'd fit right into
the lighter.

28:11.003 --> 28:12.595
That's gonna be
impossible.

28:12.838 --> 28:15.170
Look, l told you,
he never lets that lighter
leave his sight.

28:15.240 --> 28:17.902
The only time he
takes it out of his pocket
is when he plays cards...

28:17.976 --> 28:19.534
and then it stays
right on the table.

28:19.611 --> 28:22.444
Well, it wouldn't
if somebody tipped
the table over.

28:22.514 --> 28:24.311
But you told them
not to play cards anymore.

28:24.383 --> 28:26.943
My dear, a leopard
can't change his spots.

28:27.019 --> 28:29.783
And a poker player
cannot stop playing poker.

28:30.288 --> 28:31.619
[[[music playing]

28:35.627 --> 28:36.651
[sneezes]

28:36.728 --> 28:38.423
Murdock?
l'm sorry.

28:38.530 --> 28:40.088
l think we better make
that entrance again.

28:40.165 --> 28:41.689
Look, Murdock,
l think they recognize us...

28:41.767 --> 28:44.031
as the guys who shut down
their playground...

28:44.102 --> 28:46.935
so you better
watch my back.

28:47.005 --> 28:48.529
Who's gonna
watch mine?

28:52.744 --> 28:56.077
Face, your back,
it's looking good.

29:02.421 --> 29:03.854
Tender...

29:04.256 --> 29:07.225
give me milk.

29:21.373 --> 29:22.863
[cans crushing]

29:33.852 --> 29:35.513
l'll call
your $10...

29:35.887 --> 29:37.821
and raise you $15.

29:38.356 --> 29:40.586
Well, now,
isn't this nice?

29:41.426 --> 29:42.688
Who's winning?

29:52.370 --> 29:54.099
lt was just
a friendly game.

29:54.406 --> 29:56.067
We weren't using
any money.

29:56.675 --> 29:57.903
Oh, thanks.

29:58.443 --> 30:00.843
Well, this is just
a friendly roust.

30:00.912 --> 30:03.005
We're not using
any money, either.

30:06.017 --> 30:08.679
Don't drain your brain
getting any ideas, sugar.

30:09.020 --> 30:10.282
Right! Now, spread them.

30:10.355 --> 30:12.118
Up against the wall,
come on.

30:13.859 --> 30:16.384
l told your sheriff,
you're gonna push me too far.

30:17.195 --> 30:18.492
Let me tell you
something, sport...

30:18.563 --> 30:21.794
if our sheriff ever decided
to push you
as far as he can...

30:21.867 --> 30:24.461
you'd drop off the edge
and no one would
hear you scream.

30:24.703 --> 30:26.000
You know...

30:26.138 --> 30:27.935
you really
should find...

30:28.039 --> 30:30.701
better specimens
to kill your time with.

30:30.775 --> 30:33.767
Why don't you mosey,
so l don't have to
watch my language?

30:34.446 --> 30:35.743
Attagirl.

30:36.081 --> 30:39.642
All right, Murdock,
read these Cro-Magnons
the riot act.

30:41.920 --> 30:43.888
What we have
here, fellas...

30:43.955 --> 30:46.446
is a failure
to communicate.

30:47.392 --> 30:49.758
(Murdock)
As gambling, that's right,
brothers and sisters.

30:49.828 --> 30:53.059
Gambling is the root
of all evil.

30:53.165 --> 30:56.965
lt is the mother of all
sinful invention.

30:57.202 --> 30:58.464
Who? Who?

30:58.603 --> 31:02.596
Who is the first cousin
to the gambler in us all?

31:02.674 --> 31:04.301
lt is the drinker
in us all.

31:04.376 --> 31:06.173
That's right,
brothers and sisters...

31:06.311 --> 31:09.007
B-O-W-Z, booze!

31:09.080 --> 31:11.412
l was just about
to get to smoking.

31:12.417 --> 31:14.715
You guys are real tough
wearing those badges.

31:14.786 --> 31:16.754
Well, we like
to think so.

31:17.556 --> 31:20.047
l did not say
the sermon was over.

31:20.125 --> 31:22.150
l ain't even passed
the basket yet.

31:23.261 --> 31:25.252
lt's over as far as
l'm concerned.

31:26.364 --> 31:28.389
You guys are treading
in white water.

31:28.533 --> 31:31.024
Oh, come on, let's just go
before they lock you up.

31:32.204 --> 31:34.104
You wanna lock me up?
Go ahead.

31:34.239 --> 31:37.072
Otherwise, l'm gonna go
and do as l please.

31:53.491 --> 31:54.719
[beeping]

31:56.394 --> 31:58.089
Now l got to tell you,
you were pretty good...

31:58.163 --> 32:00.563
at getting that lighter
back into Boyle's pocket.

32:00.865 --> 32:03.333
Just pretty good?
Oh, come on, l thought
l was terrific.

32:03.468 --> 32:05.459
At least, as good
as you were
at getting it out.

32:05.537 --> 32:07.971
Well, we're not
on an even keel.

32:08.039 --> 32:11.406
l mean, you have certain
built-in distractions.

32:12.010 --> 32:13.978
Which is not to say
l'm unimpressed.

32:15.046 --> 32:16.377
Neither am l.

32:18.850 --> 32:20.283
Hey, man,
Boyle's on the move.

32:20.352 --> 32:21.341
Let's go.

33:09.734 --> 33:11.895
A cave?
What's he doing
in a cave?

33:11.970 --> 33:13.130
lt makes
sense to me.

33:13.204 --> 33:15.604
Most of the slimes l know
hang out in caves.

33:43.134 --> 33:46.433
He's on the move again.
Looks like he headed
toward Rivertown.

33:46.504 --> 33:47.994
[transmitter beeping]

33:48.206 --> 33:49.434
Okay.

33:49.908 --> 33:52.206
Let's see
what's so interesting
about this cave.

33:52.377 --> 33:53.901
Let's get
to the jeep, B.A.

33:57.582 --> 34:00.710
(Face)
Boy, oh, boy, l sure hope
there aren't bats in here.

34:00.785 --> 34:02.116
(Murdock)
You mean
flying mammals?

34:02.187 --> 34:03.415
Yeah.
(Hannibal)
Shh.

34:04.122 --> 34:05.111
Listen.

34:06.257 --> 34:08.020
(Face)
Sounds like machinery.

34:08.493 --> 34:11.893
[Hannibal whispering]
Okay, very quietly now.
Come on.

34:16.301 --> 34:17.768
[water dripping]

34:18.703 --> 34:19.897
[machinery whirring]

34:22.440 --> 34:24.135
l don't believe this.

34:31.181 --> 34:32.945
The missing men.

34:33.051 --> 34:35.781
(Hannibal)
That missile is very similar
to our X-1 2.

34:35.853 --> 34:37.617
Yeah, you could blow up
a tank with that thing.

34:37.688 --> 34:38.713
[footsteps approaching]

34:38.790 --> 34:40.087
(Boyle)
That's correct.

34:41.192 --> 34:43.989
All right,
put your weapons
down here.

34:49.067 --> 34:52.525
l'd like you to meet
my friend, Capt. Cordoba.

34:53.705 --> 34:57.937
You know, your moves
aren't any better
than my lady friend over here.

35:00.678 --> 35:02.373
And he sent
that homing device...

35:02.447 --> 35:05.678
back to Rivertown
with one of my men,
it made you think l left.

35:05.750 --> 35:08.275
You're not the only one
that can play
a good con game.

35:09.254 --> 35:12.519
Nikki, you wanted to meet
your brother, huh, sweetheart?

35:16.461 --> 35:17.723
Craig!

35:18.329 --> 35:19.387
Nikki!

35:20.098 --> 35:22.032
An ambitious project,
Cordoba.

35:22.100 --> 35:25.092
When you have a small army,
you must carry a big stick.

35:25.170 --> 35:27.661
And in this case,
a missile.

35:27.739 --> 35:31.175
l will be able to secure
the presidential palace
within a couple of minutes.

35:31.242 --> 35:32.800
With an army
as small as mine.

35:34.012 --> 35:36.310
The presidential security
suspects nothing.

35:36.381 --> 35:37.848
No ammo depots
have been hit...

35:37.916 --> 35:40.214
nothing traceable has been
smuggled into the country.

35:40.285 --> 35:43.083
The element of surprise
is the key.

35:43.154 --> 35:45.645
And you've been supplying
the work force, right, Boyle?

35:45.857 --> 35:46.983
lt's nice.

35:47.058 --> 35:48.457
What do you
get out of it?

35:48.526 --> 35:52.087
As soon as Cordoba takes over
the presidential palace...

35:52.363 --> 35:53.455
he'll be
running the country...

35:53.531 --> 35:56.591
and l'm sure he'll find
something interesting
for me to do.

35:57.969 --> 35:58.958
Move!

36:24.696 --> 36:26.323
Well, excuse us,
gentlemen.

36:26.464 --> 36:30.264
We no longer need you,
the men, nor the machine shop.

36:54.359 --> 36:55.519

36:56.861 --> 36:59.386
Face? Murdock?
See how bad it is?

36:59.464 --> 37:01.193
(Murdock)
You got it!
(Face)
Right.

37:01.399 --> 37:03.731
Hey, B.A., let's
see what we got in here?

37:06.437 --> 37:07.927
(Face)
l'll be darned.

37:09.140 --> 37:10.937
(Murdock)
We're never gonna
get out of here.

37:12.911 --> 37:14.936
We need a bulldozer
to get through there.

37:15.013 --> 37:17.277
Yeah, it's just our luck.
l don't see any.

37:17.348 --> 37:18.542
l'd better go enlighten
the colonel.

37:18.616 --> 37:20.743
All right. They don't
wanna see this.
l'm gonna put it out.

37:20.818 --> 37:21.807
All right.

37:25.256 --> 37:27.520
l can't get it out!
(Face)
Come on, Murdock!

37:27.592 --> 37:30.823
Wait a minute.
l'll be there.

37:40.471 --> 37:42.496
Well, Cordoba,
l won't be needing this.

37:42.774 --> 37:44.071
Keep it, Boyle.

37:44.142 --> 37:48.738
We need your expertise.
Besides, your adventurous self
will enjoy the attack.

37:49.581 --> 37:50.878
Thought you'd never ask.

37:50.949 --> 37:51.938
Good!

37:54.152 --> 37:55.449
Well,
what's the story?

37:55.520 --> 37:56.953
Well, did you
ever hear of King Tut?

37:57.021 --> 37:59.046
We ain't ever getting
out of there, Colonel.

37:59.257 --> 38:02.351
Hey, man, the first time ever
we have guns and ammo.

38:02.427 --> 38:03.587
(B.A.)
And can't get out
of here.

38:03.661 --> 38:05.492
Well, the lights seem
to be staying on.

38:05.563 --> 38:07.463
That means the exhaust fans
are working, too.

38:07.532 --> 38:09.830
Oh, really? Hey, Face,
you got a cigar?

38:09.901 --> 38:12.665
When's the last time
l didn't have
a cigar for you?

38:13.571 --> 38:16.870
Okay, now,
this is the plan.

40:05.917 --> 40:07.350
All right, Murdock.

40:22.633 --> 40:24.032
l like it.

40:42.386 --> 40:44.013
Good work, B.A.

40:55.733 --> 40:57.291
l don't believe it.
We did it!

40:57.368 --> 40:58.562
All right!

41:09.147 --> 41:10.614
Come on, Face!

41:46.984 --> 41:48.918
We go in right after
the launch, huh?

41:48.986 --> 41:51.511
President Ortega is in
for a big surprise, no?

41:51.589 --> 41:52.851
[Cordoba laughing]

41:52.924 --> 41:54.084
Ready, Murdock?

41:54.158 --> 41:55.147
Quick!

42:03.568 --> 42:04.899
[explosions]

42:19.116 --> 42:21.710
You, to the jeep!
Charge them!

42:29.527 --> 42:33.657
Hannibal, we need
more potato sticks!
Got a fly on our tail.

43:18.809 --> 43:22.370
Give yourself up, gentlemen!
You do not have a chance!

43:22.480 --> 43:23.913
Throw out your weapons!

43:23.981 --> 43:26.848
You want
our weapons? Okay.

43:26.918 --> 43:29.148
Here, here's
the bullets first.

43:40.898 --> 43:43.298
(Face)
lt's Craig and the workers
from the mine.

43:43.734 --> 43:45.031
All right!

44:45.196 --> 44:48.791
Sheriffs of Rivertown,
l'm gonna miss this job.

44:48.866 --> 44:51.926
Hey, if it weren't
for you guys, there wouldn't
even be a Rivertown.

44:52.003 --> 44:54.198
Yeah, there wouldn't be
a Craig Monroe, either.

44:55.272 --> 44:58.241
So, if you ever come
to Oklahoma, you should
look us up.

44:58.542 --> 45:01.170
l'll fix you one
of my special
home-cooked meals.

45:01.479 --> 45:02.605
Just...

45:02.880 --> 45:05.713
do me a favor
and promise
not to make any fists.

45:05.783 --> 45:07.114
Yeah, well,
actually...

45:07.184 --> 45:10.779
fighting's not really
my strong suit.
l'm much more...

45:10.855 --> 45:13.847
adept at romantic endeavors.

45:16.227 --> 45:17.285
[groaning]

45:18.796 --> 45:21.060
lf you don't wanna
miss the plane,
you better get a move on.

45:21.132 --> 45:22.121
Yeah.

45:26.504 --> 45:27.869
You ready, sis?

45:29.507 --> 45:30.496
Yeah.

45:33.277 --> 45:34.301
Thanks again.

45:34.378 --> 45:35.367
(Hannibal)
Good luck.

45:36.147 --> 45:37.614
Adios, amigos.

45:44.255 --> 45:46.416
Speaking of planes,
Hannibal....

45:47.558 --> 45:50.049
(Face)
Now, wait. What?

45:53.297 --> 45:56.357
Oh, B.A., you're not mad
just because...

45:56.434 --> 45:58.902
[stuttering]
we flew you down here?

45:58.969 --> 46:00.493
Now, wait a minute,
wait a minute!

46:00.571 --> 46:02.471
Remember your oath
as a deputy...

46:02.540 --> 46:04.269
not to hurt
other deputies.

46:04.341 --> 46:06.639
l see three badges
on the table.

46:06.710 --> 46:10.441
That means you are civilians.
l still got my badge.

46:10.514 --> 46:13.449
And as the official
law officer of Rivertown...

46:13.517 --> 46:15.951
l'm giving you guys
two days in jail.

46:19.190 --> 46:20.623
l love it...

46:21.258 --> 46:23.021
when a plan comes together.

46:24.305 --> 46:30.603
