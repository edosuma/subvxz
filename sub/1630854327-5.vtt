is no Chicago,

04:24.031 --> 04:26.834
Oh,
it's so good to see you.

04:26.834 --> 04:29.269
So, how long has this clinic
been open?

04:29.269 --> 04:30.738
45 years.

04:30.738 --> 04:32.906
Last year, we provided
more than 2,000 patients

04:32.906 --> 04:35.008
with birth control,
prenatal care,

04:35.008 --> 04:37.277

STD testing,

04:37.277 --> 04:39.447

Hm?

04:40.581 --> 04:42.616
Come on.
Look outside, guys.

04:42.616 --> 04:44.084
Let me at least
crack a joke.

04:44.084 --> 04:46.286
Well, it seems like
there's plenty of demand.

04:46.286 --> 04:49.022
Yeah, we added a construction
trailer when Roe was overturned,

04:49.022 --> 04:51.792
and I moved our staff offices
and break room

04:51.792 --> 04:54.662
so we could convert more space
for these exam rooms.

04:54.662 --> 04:56.163
Smart.
Okay.

04:56.163 --> 04:59.600
Cynthia also somehow fit
a full-size couch

04:59.600 --> 05:01.335
in our dorm room,
and a mini fridge.

05:01.335 --> 05:03.371
Yeah, well,
I can figure out space,

05:03.371 --> 05:05.473
but without volunteers
like you,

05:05.473 --> 05:09.142
coming from Seattle and Spokane,
I'd be sunk.

05:09.142 --> 05:10.811
Alright.
Put us to work.

05:10.811 --> 05:14.147
Okay, these are the patients
who are ready to be seen.

05:14.147 --> 05:16.216
These are the patients
who have not been seen.

05:16.216 --> 05:18.386
It's a low-tech operation,

05:18.386 --> 05:19.787
but somehow it gets
the job done.

05:19.787 --> 05:21.054
Okay.
Okay.

05:21.054 --> 05:22.456
Have fun!

05:22.456 --> 05:24.458

the family reunion is happening?

05:30.898 --> 05:33.467

I mean my #workfamily.

05:33.467 --> 05:35.803
You want a photo?
Let's get one.
I don't, actually.

05:35.803 --> 05:37.905
Good morning, Tom.
I see you haven't changed.

05:37.905 --> 05:40.374
Well, you might want to stop
by ophthalmology, seventh floor,

05:40.374 --> 05:42.576
east wing, because I've toned
the glutes and the abs.

05:42.576 --> 05:44.412
Wow.
No, Bostonians
are noticing.

05:44.412 --> 05:45.646
I haven't heard that.

05:45.646 --> 05:46.880
Catherine, you look
radiant as ever.

05:46.880 --> 05:48.081
Shall we?

05:48.081 --> 05:49.316
Where are you two going?

05:49.316 --> 05:50.384
We got a little project.

05:50.384 --> 05:51.652
You want to elaborate?

05:51.652 --> 05:53.086
Oh, it's not
your business.

05:53.086 --> 05:55.723
Well, I run the foundation,
so actually it is.

05:55.723 --> 05:58.826

05:58.826 --> 05:59.860

06:02.830 --> 06:04.998

06:04.998 --> 06:06.834
Oh! Hey.

06:06.834 --> 06:08.536
Hi.
Hey. What's going on?

06:08.536 --> 06:09.837
Tell me everything.

06:09.837 --> 06:11.371
Can we go up to your office

06:11.371 --> 06:14.442
so that I can have
my nervous breakdown in private?

06:22.916 --> 06:25.853
Okay, Jessica, uh, do you
have enough prenatal vitamins?

06:25.853 --> 06:27.187
They're still free.

06:27.187 --> 06:28.456
I could use more. Okay.

06:29.790 --> 06:31.692
Okay, come back
in two weeks, yeah?

06:31.692 --> 06:33.026
Um, great.

06:33.026 --> 06:34.294
I made all my appointments
weeks ago.

06:34.294 --> 06:35.228
It's too hard to get
in here otherwise.

06:35.228 --> 06:36.564
Alright, take good care.

06:36.564 --> 06:38.632
I loved my "measure and listen"
appointments

06:38.632 --> 06:39.900
when I was pregnant
with Tuck.

06:39.900 --> 06:41.769
My favorite part
about being an OB.

06:41.769 --> 06:43.437
Mm-hmm.
So, what have you had so far?

06:43.437 --> 06:46.440
Um, I did consults
with six women

06:46.440 --> 06:48.442
who wanted
medication abortions.

06:48.442 --> 06:51.612
I gave pills to five.
Did someone need a D&C?

06:51.612 --> 06:53.614
They changed their mind.

06:53.614 --> 06:55.683
We are making progress. Mm.

06:59.419 --> 07:03.423
Progress is neither
swift nor easy.

07:03.423 --> 07:05.292
Marie Curie.

07:05.292 --> 07:07.127
First woman to win
the Nobel Prize.

07:07.127 --> 07:10.063
Think she knew what
she was talking about. Mm.

07:10.063 --> 07:11.665

07:11.665 --> 07:13.400
Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah, I got him,

07:34.955 --> 07:36.657
No. You?

07:38.391 --> 07:40.127

07:51.539 --> 07:53.674
Wow.
He's Lincoln's.

07:53.674 --> 07:55.375
And Shepherd's.
We know what's up.

07:55.375 --> 07:57.477
I'm just dropping
him off at daycare.

07:57.477 --> 07:59.880
Shepherd had an emergency
and needed a favor.

07:59.880 --> 08:01.982
Wonder what other kinds
of favors he does for her.

08:01.982 --> 08:03.050
What's that?

08:04.351 --> 08:05.886
You going to the
lunch-and-learn today?

08:05.886 --> 08:07.120
Dad-o.

08:07.120 --> 08:09.156

08:09.156 --> 08:10.724
No, no, no.

08:10.724 --> 08:12.392
It's h-his dino.

08:12.392 --> 08:15.495
He-- He--
He can't say "dino."

08:17.631 --> 08:19.800
Alright.
Isn't the daycare
two floors up?

08:19.800 --> 08:22.636
Uh, stairs are
good exercise.

08:28.809 --> 08:30.644
I miss paper.

08:30.644 --> 08:32.179
Same.

08:32.179 --> 08:34.682
Except, at least with e-records,
I can read my own notes.

08:36.483 --> 08:39.920
I've got a 39-year-old with a
cesarean-scar ectopic pregnancy.

08:39.920 --> 08:41.655
C-section scar?

08:41.655 --> 08:45.325
Yes, the fetus can attach
to the scar on the uterine wall.

08:45.325 --> 08:47.094
Her OB found it
on an ultrasound this morning.

08:47.094 --> 08:49.396
He wouldn't remove it.
They're in Idaho.

08:49.396 --> 08:51.765
It's a life-threatening case,
so there should be an exception.

08:51.765 --> 08:54.768
There's cardiac activity.
He didn't want to take the risk.

08:54.768 --> 08:56.604
The law is confusing.

08:56.604 --> 08:58.772
Nobody wants to be the first one
to lose their license

08:58.772 --> 09:00.440
or be charged
with a felony.

09:00.440 --> 09:02.442
Alright. I'll see her.
Which room?

09:02.442 --> 09:04.077
Across the border
in Moscow.

09:05.646 --> 09:07.347
She called from the OB's
parking lot.

09:07.347 --> 09:10.217
Also, her car won't start.

09:10.217 --> 09:11.885
You wanted to help.

09:11.885 --> 09:13.754
I'll get the keys.

09:17.090 --> 09:19.059
What do you mean
"panic attacks"?

09:19.059 --> 09:22.596
You know, she gets dizzy,
her body shakes,

09:22.596 --> 09:24.197
she has trouble breathing.

09:24.197 --> 09:26.366
How often
is this happening?

09:26.366 --> 09:27.635
Often enough.

09:27.635 --> 09:29.436
I mean, her grades
are slipping.

09:29.436 --> 09:31.138
She can't relate
to her friends.

09:31.138 --> 09:32.640
Because she's scared
of Alzheimer's?

09:34.608 --> 09:37.044
I-I mean,
she's very bright,

09:37.044 --> 09:40.313
and she's under-stimulated
at school, and her mind

09:40.313 --> 09:43.583
goes in 17 different directions
at one time.

09:43.583 --> 09:47.420
And she's very aware that Ellis
died of early-onset Alzheimer's.

09:47.420 --> 09:49.657
And so of course
her mind goes there.

09:49.657 --> 09:52.760
She's afraid that I will get it,
that Maggie will get it.

09:52.760 --> 09:54.227
Alright.
So, how you handling it all?

09:54.227 --> 09:55.395
Therapy or...

09:55.395 --> 09:56.830
We go to therapy
once a week.

09:56.830 --> 09:58.666
But it's not enough.

09:58.666 --> 10:01.068
I mean, she has severe anxiety,
and I completely missed it.

10:01.068 --> 10:03.503
She was always
my cheerful child.

10:03.503 --> 10:05.005
I never had to worry
about her.

10:05.005 --> 10:06.173
Right.
So you didn't.

10:08.241 --> 10:10.010
I just want to help her.

10:10.010 --> 10:11.945
I just want
to comfort her.

10:11.945 --> 10:14.281
I don't know what to do.
I am so exhausted.

10:14.281 --> 10:16.917
I stay up every night,
just reading

10:16.917 --> 10:20.253
pages and pages and pages
about Alzheimer's, thinking,

10:20.253 --> 10:22.422
"Oh, if I cure Alzheimer's,
I can help Zola."

10:22.422 --> 10:23.623
Ridiculous.

10:23.623 --> 10:25.192
Makes absolutely
no sense.

10:25.192 --> 10:30.163
It's ridiculous, I know, but
I just feel powerless and...

10:31.164 --> 10:32.666
...I hate that feeling.

10:32.666 --> 10:34.868
What if it wasn't
ridiculous?

10:34.868 --> 10:36.169
What?

10:36.169 --> 10:38.505
What if you try to cure
Alzheimer's?

10:42.843 --> 10:45.345
Henry.

10:45.345 --> 10:48.048
Baseball emoji,
smiley face, sunflower.

10:48.048 --> 10:50.350
I'm going to interpret that
as affection.

10:50.350 --> 10:52.319
Wait 'til he's a teenager

10:52.319 --> 10:53.486
and you just get letters--

10:53.486 --> 10:55.488
B-R-B...
Mm.

10:55.488 --> 10:58.391
...I-D-K, and
the enigmatic K-K.

10:58.391 --> 11:00.193
Why the two K's?

11:00.193 --> 11:01.561
Tuck claims
it's more respectful.

11:01.561 --> 11:02.896
But, you know,
what do I know?

11:02.896 --> 11:04.732
I'm just his chauffeur.

11:04.732 --> 11:07.067
Speaking of which,
I-I can take over driving.

11:07.067 --> 11:08.235
I like to drive.

11:08.235 --> 11:10.738
It's 20 minutes
to Moscow.

11:10.738 --> 11:14.742
Never thought I'd have to drive
across state lines

11:14.742 --> 11:16.476
to pick up a patient.

11:16.476 --> 11:19.312
Hm.
Feels like
we're on the lam.

11:19.312 --> 11:21.648
The medical
Thelma and Louise.

11:21.648 --> 11:23.250
Didn't they drive
off a cliff?

11:23.250 --> 11:24.818
Bonnie and Clyde.

11:24.818 --> 11:25.886
Shot to death.

11:25.886 --> 11:29.723
Bailey and Addison?

11:29.723 --> 11:32.392
American heroes.

11:36.396 --> 11:39.733
Is it okay if Kyle
picks her up after five?

11:39.733 --> 11:41.601
I really appreciate it.

11:41.601 --> 11:42.903
No, no, no, no.

11:42.903 --> 11:44.204
I'll be fine.

11:44.204 --> 11:46.874
Yeah.
You're doing plenty.

11:46.874 --> 11:48.075
Oh, uh, they're here.

11:48.075 --> 11:49.409
I gotta go.
Susan?

11:49.409 --> 11:50.944
Dr. Montgomery?
Yes. That's me.

11:50.944 --> 11:53.280
Thanks so much
for the ride.

11:53.280 --> 11:55.783
I didn't realize the clinic was
such a full-service operation.

11:55.783 --> 11:58.085
Well, Dr. Bailey
is also a surgeon.

11:58.085 --> 12:00.120
Yeah, this is just
our side hustle.

12:00.120 --> 12:02.289
Water?
Ah, yes. Thank you.

12:02.289 --> 12:04.624
Seat belts.

12:04.624 --> 12:06.626
Are you sure no one needs
an assist in the O.R.?

12:06.626 --> 12:08.295
Or... pit?

12:08.295 --> 12:11.464
The square knot is
the foundation for all knots.

12:11.464 --> 12:14.167
15 minutes a day
is a good investment in time.

12:15.502 --> 12:18.138
Damn it. Too loose. Ahhhh.

12:18.138 --> 12:20.607
Yeah,
your guy's still bleeding.

12:20.607 --> 12:21.809
Oh, I hope
that's not his face.

12:21.809 --> 12:23.310
Or his liver.
Or his heart.

12:23.310 --> 12:25.445
9-1-1.

12:25.445 --> 12:28.048
Oh, God forbid it's someone
who needs stitches.
Something good?

12:28.048 --> 12:29.449
I-I don't know yet.
The pit?

12:31.218 --> 12:33.720
Uh, yeah,
something like that.

12:33.720 --> 12:37.390
You sure your son
hasn't got us figured out?

12:37.390 --> 12:39.893
Did he seem
suspicious of you?
How could he not be?

12:39.893 --> 12:42.062
I'm a Greek sculptor's dream,
and you're only human.

12:42.062 --> 12:43.396
Oh, please. No.

12:43.396 --> 12:44.965
Sneaking around
with the boss's mom

12:44.965 --> 12:46.800
is not gonna help
my performance review.

12:46.800 --> 12:48.168
This is between
you and me.

12:48.168 --> 12:50.003
Don't let Jackson
get all up in your head.

12:50.003 --> 12:53.140
Oh, so, what you're saying is
we're gonna have to kill him.

12:53.140 --> 12:54.407
Be serious, Tom.

12:54.407 --> 12:55.909
Okay, fine.
I'll kill him myself.

12:55.909 --> 12:58.278
But you-- you got to deal
with your husband.

12:58.278 --> 13:02.449
Tom, could you just please
tell me about my scans?

13:03.984 --> 13:06.119
It's not the news
we wanted.

13:06.119 --> 13:08.288
So, the tumor is bigger?

13:08.288 --> 13:09.522
Two millimeters.

13:09.522 --> 13:11.458
Two millimeters?
That's nothing.

13:11.458 --> 13:13.994
It's not "nothing."
It's growing.

13:15.328 --> 13:17.865
How you feeling?
The same.

13:17.865 --> 13:19.499
Mostly well.
Occasional pain.

13:19.499 --> 13:21.801
Two millimeters
isn't worth this conversation.

13:21.801 --> 13:24.137
Catherine, two months ago,
we did a scan

13:24.137 --> 13:26.139
and we noted
your tumor had grown.

13:26.139 --> 13:27.941
And?

13:27.941 --> 13:29.642
And you said if it grew further,
you'd consider more treatment.

13:29.642 --> 13:31.478
I know what I said.
And it grew.

13:31.478 --> 13:33.013
Two millimeters.

13:33.013 --> 13:34.814
Your son thinks you're still
in remission.

13:34.814 --> 13:38.151
It's two millimeters!
It's not remission.

13:38.151 --> 13:39.786
You need more treatment.

13:39.786 --> 13:42.122
And you need to talk
to your husband and your son

13:42.122 --> 13:43.723
and let them know
what's going on.

13:43.723 --> 13:46.226
And you need to remember that
my name is on this building.

13:46.226 --> 13:49.396
So I'll be the one
to decide what I need.

14:00.707 --> 14:02.142
I-I got a text about
Scout Lincoln.

14:02.142 --> 14:03.843
Something about an accident?
Is he okay?

14:03.843 --> 14:05.178
He's fine.
He's just wet.

14:05.178 --> 14:06.679
Oh.

14:06.679 --> 14:08.181
We used his backup clothes
last week,

14:08.181 --> 14:10.017
and we never got new ones. Okay...

14:10.017 --> 14:12.019
We tried his parents,
but they're both in surgery.

14:12.019 --> 14:13.853
We had your information
from this morning.

14:13.853 --> 14:15.422
What?
So I'm supposed to...

14:15.422 --> 14:17.857
A few parents have found clothes
at the gift shop.

14:17.857 --> 14:20.360
I'm sure you don't want him
to be uncomfortable.

14:25.465 --> 14:27.434
Tina's bringing Emily
home with Colette,

14:27.434 --> 14:29.569
so you can pick her up there
after work.

14:29.569 --> 14:31.939
I canceled
the piano lesson,

14:31.939 --> 14:35.242
and can you pick up fruit snacks
and Pirate's Booty?

14:35.242 --> 14:37.110
It's our week to bring
the snacks to soccer.

14:37.110 --> 14:39.079
Martha said she'll come get me
when I'm done.

14:39.079 --> 14:40.413
I'll be fine.

14:40.413 --> 14:42.149
Love you, too. Bye.

14:43.283 --> 14:46.019
What'd I do
with my keys?

14:46.019 --> 14:47.787
I had them when you
picked me up, right?

14:47.787 --> 14:49.422
I'm sorry.
I don't remember.

14:49.422 --> 14:50.590
Don't be.

14:50.590 --> 14:52.459
I'm usually ready
for anything,

14:52.459 --> 14:55.963
but ectopic pregnancy
wasn't on my calendar.

14:55.963 --> 14:57.197
It kinda threw me.

14:57.197 --> 14:58.831
Totally understandable.

15:02.769 --> 15:04.237
Bracelets.

15:04.237 --> 15:05.572
My daughter makes them.

15:05.572 --> 15:07.074
Take one. Heck...

15:07.074 --> 15:09.242
Take two, please.
Aww!

15:09.242 --> 15:12.579
She's made enough for everyone
this side of the Mississippi.

15:12.579 --> 15:15.748
But it keeps her busy when I'm
trying to get ready for work.

15:15.748 --> 15:17.750
We get it.
We have kids.

15:17.750 --> 15:18.785
How old's your daughter?

15:18.785 --> 15:20.087
Five.
Aww.

15:20.087 --> 15:22.422
She turns six next week.

15:22.422 --> 15:23.790
Ooh, sweet. Ahh.

15:23.790 --> 15:26.393
She only asked for, um,
one present--

15:26.393 --> 15:28.728
a sister.

15:28.728 --> 15:31.064
She's been calling
the baby Sundae

15:31.064 --> 15:33.133
'cause she loves ice cream.

15:34.601 --> 15:37.037
I can still get pregnant
after this, right?

15:38.371 --> 15:42.509
It's hard for me to know without
doing further imaging tests.

15:42.509 --> 15:44.377
But it is possible.

15:46.046 --> 15:47.614
Ohh!

15:50.017 --> 15:52.319
Dr. Montgomery?

15:52.319 --> 15:53.686
This is bad, right?

15:55.522 --> 15:57.991
Ahh! Ahh! Ah!

16:00.127 --> 16:03.630
IDH inhibitors, CDK inhibitors,
immune checkpoint inhibitors--

16:03.630 --> 16:05.465
Please.
I'm not one for inhibition.

16:05.465 --> 16:07.134
And historically I've
been grateful for that.

16:07.134 --> 16:08.468
But these trials
have really--

16:08.468 --> 16:09.802
I've already done
one of these.

16:09.802 --> 16:11.638
And it helped.
It helped.

16:11.638 --> 16:13.873
But it made me feel
like absolute hell.

16:13.873 --> 16:16.143
I said I would consider
more treatment.

16:16.143 --> 16:17.810
I did.
It's not what I want.

16:17.810 --> 16:19.812
Okay, so don't do it for you,
hmm? Do it for me.

16:19.812 --> 16:21.481
If you think about it,
you really owe me one.

16:21.481 --> 16:23.816
I'm getting help, if that
makes you feel any better.

16:23.816 --> 16:26.319
Mm?
I met a medicine man
in Bali.

16:26.319 --> 16:28.121
I met a shaman
in Peru.

16:28.121 --> 16:31.391
I learned all about energy
medicine and frequency medicine,

16:31.391 --> 16:34.294
medicines that don't make me
feel like I'm suffering.

16:34.294 --> 16:35.962
T-That's because
they don't work.

16:35.962 --> 16:37.630
According to you.

16:37.630 --> 16:39.966
I have an acupuncturist
who's done more for my pain

16:39.966 --> 16:41.634
than any pill
you ever prescribed.

16:41.634 --> 16:44.137
And studies show that Reiki
will reduce pain

16:44.137 --> 16:46.639
and it can improve
post-op recovery.

16:46.639 --> 16:49.142
Catherine, please--
Tom, Tom, Tom.

16:49.142 --> 16:51.811
I know you mean well.

16:51.811 --> 16:54.214
And you've been
carrying my secret.

16:55.682 --> 16:57.250
But this is <i>my</i> cancer.

16:57.250 --> 16:58.651
Mm.

16:58.651 --> 17:01.554
This is my choice.

17:03.323 --> 17:04.991
Ah. Got it.

17:04.991 --> 17:06.993
This group of neuroscientists
from Brussels--

17:06.993 --> 17:09.696
they applied for a grant
to expand their research

17:09.696 --> 17:12.031
on the connection
between Alzheimer's and--

17:12.031 --> 17:15.102
Gut microbial composition.
I've read studies on it.

17:15.102 --> 17:18.004
There are also some
that link gut integrity

17:18.004 --> 17:20.507
with brain plaque production
and neuro-inflammation.

17:20.507 --> 17:22.942
I-I saw this all in
the Parkinson's research.

17:22.942 --> 17:24.711
Of course.

17:24.711 --> 17:26.279
You already know more than the
group who applied for the grant.

17:26.279 --> 17:29.048
It's your areas of specialty--
gut and brain.

17:29.048 --> 17:30.617
Yeah.
It's all theoretical.

17:30.617 --> 17:32.119
Like you didn't just do
a record-breaking study

17:32.119 --> 17:33.620
on Parkinson's
based on something that was

17:33.620 --> 17:34.787
initially theoretical?

17:34.787 --> 17:36.556
Come on.
You should do this.

17:36.556 --> 17:37.957
We could help fund it.

17:37.957 --> 17:40.227
And we got facilities,
equipment, tech.

17:40.227 --> 17:41.461
We have this
amazing partnership

17:41.461 --> 17:43.029
with MIT's brain science program.

17:43.029 --> 17:44.464
They could be a resource.

17:44.464 --> 17:46.799
You should just fund
the people from Brussels.

17:46.799 --> 17:48.568
They're not you!

17:48.568 --> 17:49.969
Meredith Grey studying the
disease that killed her mother?

17:49.969 --> 17:52.038
That's a story
that would get funding,

17:52.038 --> 17:53.706
and funding
is what cures diseases.

17:53.706 --> 17:55.142
This is exciting.

17:55.142 --> 17:57.210
What's-- What's going on?
Where'd you go?

17:57.210 --> 17:58.945
Zola was miserable
this morning.

17:58.945 --> 18:03.150
And I could never move to Boston
if she didn't want to.

18:03.150 --> 18:05.885
I mean, she's been
through so much.

18:05.885 --> 18:07.720
So much trauma.

18:07.720 --> 18:10.790
She lost her birth family,
her birth country,

18:10.790 --> 18:14.427
her father died,
I almost died.

18:14.427 --> 18:16.896
You know, all of
that stuff is--

18:16.896 --> 18:20.300
is just now coming
to the surface.

18:20.300 --> 18:23.170
I really need
to focus on her.

18:23.170 --> 18:24.671
Okay.
I hear you.

18:24.671 --> 18:26.606
I love you both.

18:26.606 --> 18:28.808
Not exactly gonna give up
on this entirely, okay?

18:28.808 --> 18:30.109
Not just yet.

18:30.109 --> 18:31.978
When did you become
so relentless?

18:31.978 --> 18:33.946
When I took this job.

18:36.683 --> 18:38.318
<i>9-1-1.
What's your emergency?</i>

18:38.318 --> 18:40.253
Yes, this is
Dr. Miranda Bailey.

18:40.253 --> 18:42.622
I have
a 39-year-old female

18:42.622 --> 18:44.624
with a ruptured
ectopic pregnancy

18:44.624 --> 18:46.426
on a cesarean scar.

18:46.426 --> 18:49.429
She's alert and oriented,
but hemorrhaging.

18:49.429 --> 18:52.465
Pulse is weak.
Abdomen is rigid and distended.

18:52.465 --> 18:56.369
We are in a blue Grey-Sloan van
on Highway 270.

18:56.369 --> 18:57.704
Can you send an ambulance?

18:57.704 --> 18:59.206
<i>On its way.</i>
Thank you.

18:59.206 --> 19:00.307
How's it going
back there?

19:00.307 --> 19:01.974
We're okay.

19:01.974 --> 19:04.477
Doing okay, Susan.

19:04.477 --> 19:05.478
What are you looking for?

19:05.478 --> 19:07.146
Uterine balloon tamponade?

19:07.146 --> 19:08.481
Not gonna find one
in there.

19:08.481 --> 19:10.149
My OB just said
I was okay.

19:10.149 --> 19:11.651
Well, it's difficult
to predict

19:11.651 --> 19:14.787
if or when an ectopic pregnancy
will rupture, Susan.

19:14.787 --> 19:16.122
This looks like
a lot of blood.

19:16.122 --> 19:17.457
Is-- Is this
a lot of blood?

19:17.457 --> 19:19.726
The pregnancy invaded
the muscle layers

19:19.726 --> 19:22.229
and likely tore open
the uterine incision,

19:22.229 --> 19:23.963
which is why we have to--
Ha!

19:23.963 --> 19:25.632
What is that?
A Foley catheter.

19:25.632 --> 19:28.635
If I insert this into
your vagina and inflate it,

19:28.635 --> 19:31.238
the pressure against your uterus
will slow the bleeding.

19:31.238 --> 19:32.639
Is that okay?
Is it safe?

19:32.639 --> 19:34.341
It's safer than letting you
keep bleeding.

19:34.341 --> 19:35.675
Y-Yeah.
Okay, do it.

19:35.675 --> 19:37.344
Just-- ohh!--
make it stop.

19:37.344 --> 19:38.345
Okay. I'm inserting it.

19:38.345 --> 19:39.479
Okay.
Try to hold still.

19:39.479 --> 19:41.248
Bailey,
no sudden moves.

19:41.248 --> 19:43.816
Could I have prevented this
if I didn't get the C-section?

19:43.816 --> 19:46.753
You didn't do anything wrong.
C-sections are safe.

19:46.753 --> 19:50.189
This kind of ectopic pregnancy
is extremely rare.

19:50.189 --> 19:51.524
You doing okay?
Uh-huh.

19:51.524 --> 19:53.526
Okay, I'm gonna inflate
the balloon now.

19:53.526 --> 19:55.695
You're gonna feel
a little bit of pressure.

19:55.695 --> 19:57.430
Hold still.
You got it.

19:59.098 --> 20:00.400
Okay.

20:00.400 --> 20:02.101
That should buy us
a little bit of time.

20:03.102 --> 20:04.737
And how much time?

20:07.907 --> 20:09.409
It's okay.

20:17.116 --> 20:19.952
Do you want a bag?
No, I'm good.

20:19.952 --> 20:21.288
Oh, good luck with that.
I asked Schmitt for a day off.

20:21.288 --> 20:22.855
He looked at me like
I killed his dog.

20:22.855 --> 20:24.190
Uh, a bag, bag-- I need a bag.
Oh, hey, Skywalker!

20:24.190 --> 20:26.626
Hey.
W-What are you, uh, doing here?

20:26.626 --> 20:28.361
Getting snacks.

20:28.361 --> 20:30.930
Apparently the vending machine
is too lowbrow for Dr. Kwan.

20:30.930 --> 20:33.032
Yogurt-covered pretzels?
I need brain food.

20:33.032 --> 20:34.467
Cashews and almonds.

20:34.467 --> 20:37.036
Ah, is that what powers
that ego?

20:37.036 --> 20:38.204
What are you doing?

20:38.204 --> 20:40.139
Uh, s-same.
$32.75.

20:40.139 --> 20:41.574
Wow.
That is a lot of snacks.

20:41.574 --> 20:43.610
I, uh... Geez.

20:43.610 --> 20:45.278
I forgot my wallet
in my locker.

20:45.278 --> 20:49.148
I'll spot you,
but I get your next appy.

20:49.148 --> 20:51.951
Hey, that's my--
Ooh, ooh, ooh.

20:51.951 --> 20:53.586
Wow.

20:53.586 --> 20:56.456
I may be wrong, but I think
these are a little too small.

20:56.456 --> 20:58.291
They're not for me.
They're for the--

20:58.291 --> 20:59.926
Let me guess.

20:59.926 --> 21:01.594
Daddy Daycare?

21:01.594 --> 21:03.963
Oh, Schmitt.
Oh, Schmitt.

21:06.265 --> 21:07.667
It's okay.

21:07.667 --> 21:10.136
I'll let him know that
you have child care issues.

21:12.672 --> 21:15.274
Should I get
another bag, or...

21:16.643 --> 21:18.445
Yeah, and you were
interested in neuro,

21:18.445 --> 21:20.146
and you set that aside
for Derek.

21:20.146 --> 21:22.815
Oh, it was a bit more
complicated than that.

21:22.815 --> 21:25.084
Like how hard it was to choose
general surgery

21:25.084 --> 21:26.486
because of Ellis?

21:26.486 --> 21:28.321
I wish I could make one decision
in my life

21:28.321 --> 21:30.357
where people didn't bring
Ellis into it.

21:30.357 --> 21:32.158
A couple years ago,

21:32.158 --> 21:34.861
I actually got to spend
some time with my father.

21:34.861 --> 21:37.664
Realized my entire life
he had loomed so large.

21:37.664 --> 21:39.999
He was this...
mountain of a man.

21:39.999 --> 21:42.168
And I spend some time with him,
I realize he's just some guy.

21:42.168 --> 21:45.372
With wasted potential
and regrets and flaws.

21:45.372 --> 21:46.773
You didn't want to be
like him.

21:46.773 --> 21:48.641
The scary part is,
I wasn't that different.

21:48.641 --> 21:50.510
I mean, I was living
in cruise control, you know?

21:50.510 --> 21:52.712
I wasn't fulfilling
my potential.

21:52.712 --> 21:54.981
Feeling that similarity
to him was painful.

21:54.981 --> 21:56.315
But it also
propelled me forward.

21:56.315 --> 21:57.684
I mean,
I'm happier here,

21:57.684 --> 21:59.819
doing something
I'm passionate about.

21:59.819 --> 22:01.354
Maybe it's not an accident
that you're up all night

22:01.354 --> 22:03.122
researching Alzheimer's.

22:03.122 --> 22:05.057
Or you're feeling so much pain
about Zola.

22:05.057 --> 22:08.227
Maybe it's all these pieces
of your life coming together.

22:08.227 --> 22:10.229
I kinda think you're having
a breakthrough

22:10.229 --> 22:12.365
rather than a breakdown.

22:12.365 --> 22:13.533
Relentless.
No.

22:13.533 --> 22:15.968
I'm just being a friend, alright?

22:15.968 --> 22:18.304
I've seen you push through
so many things before

22:18.304 --> 22:19.739
and ignore them.

22:19.739 --> 22:20.973
I'm just saying that
this might be something

22:20.973 --> 22:22.409
you don't want
to push through.

22:22.409 --> 22:25.812
I think you should let it
help you grow.

22:25.812 --> 22:28.648
Once upon a time,
I did want to cure Alzheimer's.

22:28.648 --> 22:30.650
Exactly.
But what if it fails?

22:30.650 --> 22:32.819
Oh, it's probably gonna fail. Right.

22:32.819 --> 22:34.654
But, I mean, you could
definitely move the needle.

22:34.654 --> 22:36.322
That means something.

22:36.322 --> 22:37.824
Zola sees that her mom
is doing everything she can

22:37.824 --> 22:39.492
to cure Alzheimer's.

22:39.492 --> 22:41.160
I mean,
that's pretty amazing.

22:46.533 --> 22:49.035
Do you see an accident?

22:49.035 --> 22:50.369
An ambulance?

22:50.369 --> 22:52.271
No. Nothing.

22:52.271 --> 22:53.740
How much longer will
the catheter hold?

22:53.740 --> 22:55.708
Not sure.

22:55.708 --> 22:57.243
Susan?

22:57.243 --> 22:58.911
Susan,
stay with me, hey?

22:58.911 --> 23:00.212
Okay?
Talk to me.

23:00.212 --> 23:01.748
Tell me, um--

23:01.748 --> 23:03.950
Tell me about
Emily's birthday party.

23:03.950 --> 23:06.218
It's a spa party.

23:06.218 --> 23:08.387
I don't know where
she got the idea.

23:08.387 --> 23:10.623
But her teenaged cousins
are coming to--

23:10.623 --> 23:12.291
to paint
the kids' nails.

23:12.291 --> 23:15.695
And she--
she wants a coffee cake.

23:15.695 --> 23:17.697
Like the kind from school.

23:17.697 --> 23:22.134
Ah.
I-- I haven't baked it yet.

23:22.134 --> 23:24.471
I need to be okay.

23:24.471 --> 23:26.939
I need to bake her cake.

23:26.939 --> 23:30.142
I want to see her
turn six.

23:30.142 --> 23:33.613
I want to see
her lose her front teeth

23:33.613 --> 23:36.483
and learn how to read.

23:36.483 --> 23:40.653
I-- I want to teach her
how to drive

23:40.653 --> 23:43.790
and send her off to prom.

23:43.790 --> 23:46.793
I want to drop her off
at college

23:46.793 --> 23:51.964
and miss her every day
'til she comes home for summer.

23:51.964 --> 23:54.634
I-- I want to--

23:54.634 --> 23:57.637
I want to-- want to watch
her f-fall in love.

23:57.637 --> 24:04.110
I w-- I want to see her
start her first real job.

24:04.110 --> 24:07.079
I want to be there
for all of it.

24:07.079 --> 24:08.681
Okay?

24:11.684 --> 24:14.987
I'm not ready to go.
I'm not...

24:16.623 --> 24:19.158
Susan?

24:19.158 --> 24:20.727
Susan!

24:22.061 --> 24:23.663
What?
I can't feel a pulse.

24:23.663 --> 24:25.197
I'm starting CPR.

24:25.197 --> 24:27.133
I'm pulling over.

24:27.133 --> 24:30.369
<i>9-1-1.
What's your emergency?</i>

24:30.369 --> 24:32.539
<i>This is Dr. Miranda Bailey
calling again</i>

24:32.539 --> 24:34.273
<i>about a patient hemorrhaging</i>

24:34.273 --> 24:36.943
<i>from a ruptured ectopic
pregnancy on Highway 270.</i>

24:36.943 --> 24:39.311
<i>She's coding.
We're starting CPR.</i>

24:39.311 --> 24:41.280
<i>We need immediate help!</i>

24:41.280 --> 24:44.116
<i>We dispatched an ambulance, but
there's a significant accident.</i>

24:44.116 --> 24:46.218
<i>Road is stopped
in both directions.</i>

24:46.218 --> 24:49.021
<i>Hopefully we'll be there soon.</i>

Herbal tea.
No caffeine.

26:26.753 --> 26:29.055
Ah, I meant consistently lying
to your friends and family.

26:29.055 --> 26:32.224
Tom, I thought we were done
with this conversation.

26:32.224 --> 26:34.593
Well, persistence
is part of my charm.

26:34.593 --> 26:37.263
Y-You can't fault me
for trying.

26:37.263 --> 26:40.266
My friend's life
is at stake.

26:40.266 --> 26:43.169
I spent the last
six months traveling abroad.

26:43.169 --> 26:45.672
And everywhere I went,
all I thought was,

26:45.672 --> 26:48.675
"Thank God
I'm not in an oncology ward."

26:48.675 --> 26:51.010
If I stay the course
without chemo,

26:51.010 --> 26:53.680
I'll have a few
good years left.

26:53.680 --> 26:56.615
I want to spend them living.

26:56.615 --> 26:58.651
If the cancer gets
more aggressive,

26:58.651 --> 27:00.619
if there's some promising
new option,

27:00.619 --> 27:03.622
maybe
I'll change my mind.

27:03.622 --> 27:05.124
But if I'm gonna be stuck
in a hospital,

27:05.124 --> 27:08.627
I want it to be as a doctor,
not as a patient.

27:08.627 --> 27:10.797
At some point,

27:10.797 --> 27:12.799
everyone's gonna know
you lied, hmm?

27:12.799 --> 27:14.867
How-- How about we just
let Jackson in on it--

27:14.867 --> 27:16.602
No.
Okay, Richard?

27:16.602 --> 27:20.306
Tom, this conversation with you
is exhausting enough.

27:20.306 --> 27:22.641
I'm not gonna have it
with anyone else.

27:22.641 --> 27:26.478
I am lying to protect my privacy
and to protect my peace.

27:26.478 --> 27:28.047
I'm happy
with this decision.

27:30.182 --> 27:31.718
You know what?
I'm not even gonna ask. Oh.

27:31.718 --> 27:33.219
Nothing to know.

27:33.219 --> 27:34.987
How about if you're ready to go?
Can I ask that?

27:34.987 --> 27:36.723
What, you--
you cutting out early?
Harriet has ballet.

27:36.723 --> 27:38.190
I told her she could just wait
for the recital, but--

27:38.190 --> 27:39.959
Wait?
Child, please.

27:39.959 --> 27:41.293
I'm here.
Let's go.

27:41.293 --> 27:43.562
I don't want
to miss anything.

27:51.037 --> 27:53.539
Dr. Kwan,
have you seen Adams?

27:53.539 --> 27:56.308
Uh, last I saw him,
he was at the gift shop...

27:56.308 --> 27:58.010
buying clothes
for your son.

27:59.578 --> 28:01.814
Don't worry.
Your secret's safe.

28:01.814 --> 28:03.716
Oh. You know?

28:03.716 --> 28:06.485
About you two?
It's pretty obvious.

28:06.485 --> 28:09.655
Is it?
Yeah, when you see
you together.

28:09.655 --> 28:11.323
You know, it might be
less obvious

28:11.323 --> 28:14.660
if you gave the rest of us
some more neuro cases.

28:14.660 --> 28:18.697
Do you have a special interest
in neuro, Dr. Kwan?

28:20.900 --> 28:22.201
I have a special interest
in gaining

28:22.201 --> 28:23.535
as much experience
as I can

28:23.535 --> 28:25.437
before I declare an area
of special interest.

28:25.437 --> 28:27.874
I also have
steady hands.

28:27.874 --> 28:29.708
And many skills
in other areas

28:29.708 --> 28:31.944
if your interests are... expansive.

28:33.545 --> 28:35.882
You think I'm playing favorites

34:02.674 --> 34:04.543
don't blow my cover

34:04.543 --> 34:06.178
And you've refused

34:06.178 --> 34:08.714
So...

34:08.714 --> 34:10.782
that makes it okay
to tell people

34:10.782 --> 34:12.451

together?

34:12.451 --> 34:14.453
I didn't tell
anybody anything.

34:14.453 --> 34:16.788
It is not my job to correct
people's misconceptions.

34:16.788 --> 34:19.291
Yes, it is.
You are an intern.

34:19.291 --> 34:20.726

34:26.798 --> 34:29.034

everyone's always assumed

34:29.034 --> 34:32.304
I only get anywhere because
of my family connections.

34:32.304 --> 34:33.972
And all my life,

34:33.972 --> 34:36.808
I've been my family's
biggest disappointment.

34:36.808 --> 34:38.310

I haven't lived up

34:38.310 --> 34:39.878
to anybody's expectations
as a Shepherd.

34:39.878 --> 34:42.448
So I thought I'd see
what happens when I'm not one.

34:42.448 --> 34:44.883
But now, thanks to your lack
of discretion,

34:44.883 --> 34:46.218
everyone believes
we're connected,

34:46.218 --> 34:47.819
just in
a-a different way--

34:47.819 --> 34:49.455
a way that is
admittedly disturbing,

34:49.455 --> 34:51.790
but for this
particular purpose,

34:51.790 --> 34:53.425
better.

34:55.361 --> 34:57.263

told them, I will.

35:17.783 --> 35:19.685
So, when does
the clinic open?

35:19.685 --> 35:21.520
A couple of days.

35:21.520 --> 35:25.324

35:43.642 --> 35:46.044

35:46.044 --> 35:48.214

35:52.984 --> 35:56.888

35:56.888 --> 35:59.358

35:59.358 --> 36:01.193

abortion bans.

36:01.193 --> 36:03.562
They're expecting
up to 14,000 women

36:03.562 --> 36:05.631
to cross state lines
for care.

36:05.631 --> 36:06.998

36:06.998 --> 36:09.635
'Cause I thought about
doing it, too.

36:09.635 --> 36:14.139

36:33.692 --> 36:35.527

the right supplies.

36:46.772 --> 36:48.440

36:48.440 --> 36:50.108
No. Okay.

36:50.108 --> 36:51.610

the fire department

36:51.610 --> 36:56.014
that he needed this O.R.
on wheels, but it...

36:56.014 --> 36:57.783

sidelined it.

36:57.783 --> 36:59.951
