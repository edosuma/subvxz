<i>Previously on</i> The Affair...

00:08.566 --> 00:09.832
- Is this your daughter?
- Yeah.

00:09.867 --> 00:11.734
Everybody says she looks
like Alison,

00:11.736 --> 00:13.235
<i>but to me, she looks
like her daddy.</i>

00:13.237 --> 00:15.171
You know what?
She does to me too.

00:15.206 --> 00:16.872
<i>I saw Scotty this morning.</i>

00:16.908 --> 00:18.340
<i>He had some plan about
buying The Lobster Roll</i>

00:18.376 --> 00:19.909
and wanted me to go in
with him.

00:19.961 --> 00:21.160
I mean, it's not like

00:21.212 --> 00:23.078
The Lobster Roll's
even for sale.

00:23.114 --> 00:24.580
<i>Well, no, it's...
it's in foreclosure.</i>

00:24.632 --> 00:26.081
<i>Really?</i>

00:26.083 --> 00:27.516
<i>So what's going on, Alison?</i>

00:27.552 --> 00:28.851
- I bought this place.
- I heard.

00:28.886 --> 00:31.053
- With Cole.
- As business partners.

00:31.088 --> 00:33.355
How does this work?
You gonna move back out here?

00:33.391 --> 00:34.890
You taking Joanie
with you?

00:34.926 --> 00:37.126
I just hoped we could
figure it out together.

00:37.161 --> 00:38.294
<i>This was my idea.</i>

00:38.329 --> 00:39.845
I-I told you about this.

00:39.897 --> 00:41.463
I told you <i>both</i> about this.

00:41.499 --> 00:43.432
- You're a fucking junkie!
- God damn it, Cole!

00:43.484 --> 00:44.934
I could tell you something

00:44.986 --> 00:47.403
that would blow up
your entire fucking life.

00:47.438 --> 00:48.904
Cut me in!

00:51.909 --> 00:52.942
Scotty.

00:52.944 --> 00:54.743
I will bring you in.
I promise.

00:54.779 --> 00:57.313
You just got to go someplace
that's gonna give you some help.

00:57.348 --> 00:58.914
Ladies and gents,
it's time to talk

00:58.950 --> 01:00.316
about that night.

01:00.351 --> 01:02.117
Look, I didn't kill
Scott Lockhart.

01:02.119 --> 01:04.420
I guess we got to find out
who did.

You're here early.

04:05.803 --> 04:06.885
No traffic.

04:06.937 --> 04:07.770
Mm.

04:10.141 --> 04:11.440
You need more time?
I can wait.

04:11.475 --> 04:13.509
No, no.
I finished.

04:13.544 --> 04:15.010
How are you doing?

04:15.045 --> 04:16.978
I'm fine.
How are you?

04:17.031 --> 04:18.613
Yeah, I'm great.

04:18.649 --> 04:19.615
How's Joanie?

04:19.649 --> 04:21.950
She's good.
Misses you.

04:21.986 --> 04:22.985
I know.

04:23.037 --> 04:24.820
I miss her too.

04:24.872 --> 04:26.822
Okay, let's go.

04:39.003 --> 04:41.537
So this is where
you've been living?

04:41.572 --> 04:44.506
Yeah, what do you think?

04:46.510 --> 04:48.811
It's the size of a closet.

04:48.846 --> 04:51.146
Yep, I know,

04:51.182 --> 04:52.848
but it's only
three days a week,

04:52.850 --> 04:54.349
and I like living above
the restaurant.

04:54.351 --> 04:56.351
It means
I can get more done.

04:56.353 --> 04:58.270
Maximize my time
out here.

04:58.322 --> 05:00.856
I got us a room
at The End tonight.

05:00.908 --> 05:03.492
You didn't have to do that.
We could just stay here.

05:03.527 --> 05:05.027
I know, but I, uh,

05:05.079 --> 05:08.363
thought it might be
a nice treat for us.

05:08.415 --> 05:10.833
Yeah, you're right.
It is.

05:10.868 --> 05:12.167
Thank you.

05:17.041 --> 05:18.791
So how was your week?

05:18.843 --> 05:21.510
Oh, it was good.
I filed a bunch of chapters.

05:21.545 --> 05:22.878
Harry liked them.

05:22.930 --> 05:24.880
Oh, you did?
That's great.

05:24.882 --> 05:26.348
Congratulations.

05:26.383 --> 05:27.466
Yeah.

05:27.518 --> 05:29.218
Maybe he'll get off my case now.

05:29.220 --> 05:31.520
Let me finish it at my own pace,
you know?

05:31.555 --> 05:33.605
No, I'm really happy
for you.

05:37.778 --> 05:39.862
I'm thinking of going to France

05:39.897 --> 05:42.397
sometime in the fall.

05:42.449 --> 05:44.700
Oh, yeah?

05:44.735 --> 05:46.368
Yeah.

05:46.403 --> 05:48.904
I just can't keep writing
in a vacuum.

05:48.906 --> 05:51.240
You know, I need to do
some on-the-ground research,

05:51.242 --> 05:53.325
see the battlegrounds,
the archives.

05:53.377 --> 05:55.661
Yeah, no, totally.
I get it.

05:58.082 --> 06:00.916
Well, I thought
maybe you could come with me.

06:00.918 --> 06:02.885
Uh, well, what about Joanie?

06:02.920 --> 06:07.005
Well, she can come too.
She's portable.

06:07.057 --> 06:10.676
Yeah, yeah, maybe.

06:10.728 --> 06:12.511
Come on.
It'd be an adventure.

06:12.563 --> 06:13.562
Just the three of us.

06:13.597 --> 06:15.063
No, I'll... I'll, uh...

06:15.099 --> 06:17.432
I'll... I'll think about it.

06:17.484 --> 06:20.018
I promise.

06:39.790 --> 06:41.456
Wow.

06:41.458 --> 06:42.491
Look at you.

06:43.594 --> 06:44.927
Do you like it?

06:45.963 --> 06:47.379
Is it new?

06:47.431 --> 06:49.998
Uh, no,
it's old, actually.

06:50.034 --> 06:52.434
I left it
at Cherry's house years ago.

06:52.469 --> 06:53.719
She just
gave it back to me.

06:55.189 --> 06:57.639
Uh, look, I have to check in
on things downstairs.

06:57.641 --> 06:59.308
Do you want to come with me?

06:59.310 --> 07:01.226
You know, the ceremony
doesn't start until five.

07:01.278 --> 07:02.444
No, no, I'll come with you.

07:02.479 --> 07:03.645
Maybe I can help...

07:03.647 --> 07:05.347
lifting things,
whatever.

07:06.483 --> 07:09.318
Hey, um...

07:10.621 --> 07:12.654
Look, thank you
for being here.

07:12.656 --> 07:15.324
I know it can't
be easy on you.

07:18.212 --> 07:19.578
I'm proud of you.

07:19.630 --> 07:20.796
You are?

07:20.831 --> 07:22.698
Restaurant looks great.

07:22.733 --> 07:24.833
It's gonna be a big success,
and you deserve it.

07:24.835 --> 07:27.970
You worked your ass off

this place.

10:15.639 --> 10:18.640

11:45.095 --> 11:46.928
and bring strength
to your commitment

11:46.930 --> 11:50.515
and bless you with the glorious
power of his love.

11:50.567 --> 11:53.185
And now, with the power
invested in me

11:53.237 --> 11:55.937
and with the church
as our witness,

11:55.989 --> 11:59.357
I now pronounce you
man and wife.

12:14.458 --> 12:15.840
Hey.

12:18.929 --> 12:20.512
I've been looking for you.

12:23.467 --> 12:25.133
What's going on, Alison?

12:25.185 --> 12:26.885
Are you really that upset
Cole's getting remarried?

12:26.937 --> 12:29.471
No, no, course not.

12:29.473 --> 12:31.606
It's got nothing to do
with that.

12:31.642 --> 12:34.059
So what's happening?

12:34.111 --> 12:37.145
Uh...

12:37.197 --> 12:38.780
...I have to tell you
something.

12:38.815 --> 12:41.650
Can you just sit down,
please?

12:41.702 --> 12:43.451
Okay, now you're scaring me.

12:46.039 --> 12:49.491
Are you sick
or something?

12:49.493 --> 12:51.243
I don't know
how to say this, Noah.

12:51.295 --> 12:53.328
I...

12:53.330 --> 12:56.298
Tell me what it is.

13:01.338 --> 13:03.672
I don't know
who Joanie's father is.

13:07.394 --> 13:10.645
What?
Wha... I-I don't understand.

13:10.681 --> 13:13.648
I, um...

13:13.684 --> 13:16.651
I slept with Cole

13:16.687 --> 13:19.237
right around the time
I got pregnant.

13:22.409 --> 13:24.192
You slept with Cole?

13:24.244 --> 13:26.778
It was when you were in the city
dealing with Martin,

13:26.830 --> 13:29.998
and I know that doesn't
make it okay, but...

13:32.419 --> 13:35.704
I didn't know if you
were ever gonna come back,

13:35.706 --> 13:38.623
and Yvonne and Robert
didn't want me there,

13:38.675 --> 13:40.125
so I-I came back to Montauk.

13:40.177 --> 13:41.960
I-I came back home and...

13:42.012 --> 13:44.963
So wait, you're telling me
Cole is Joanie's father?

13:45.015 --> 13:47.215
No, I...

13:47.267 --> 13:50.385
Look, I-I can find out
if you want me to.

13:50.387 --> 13:52.721
It's just, you're...

13:52.723 --> 13:54.556
you're such a wonderful...

13:54.558 --> 13:56.308
You...

13:56.360 --> 13:58.693
you care so much about her,
and I...

14:00.530 --> 14:03.231
I don't want to lie
anymore.

14:03.233 --> 14:06.234
We've had so many secrets
between us, and...

14:06.236 --> 14:10.238
...I am so tired
of keeping mine.

14:10.240 --> 14:11.873
I'm sorry. I...

14:11.908 --> 14:14.242
Look, I love you.
Please.

14:25.389 --> 14:28.173
So how long have you
been fucking him?

14:28.225 --> 14:30.425
No, it was just that once.
I swear.

14:30.427 --> 14:32.260
That why you bought
The Lobster Roll together?

14:32.262 --> 14:33.511
No, no.

14:33.563 --> 14:34.763
It wasn't like that.

14:34.765 --> 14:36.681
It happened years ago.

14:36.733 --> 14:38.233
Why didn't you tell me
when it happened?

14:38.268 --> 14:40.068
I-I don't know.
I don't know.

14:40.103 --> 14:42.103
You were so preoccupied
with Martin.

14:42.139 --> 14:43.238
Oh, don't blame my son.

14:43.273 --> 14:44.439
No, I-I'm not doing that.

14:44.491 --> 14:45.690
I... yeah,
I should have told you.

14:45.742 --> 14:47.442
I know that.
I was stupid.

14:47.494 --> 14:50.528
I was selfish.
I...

14:50.580 --> 14:52.747
What else
haven't you told me?

14:52.783 --> 14:55.050
Nothing.

14:55.085 --> 14:56.084
I promise,
that's it.

14:56.119 --> 14:57.252
Yeah, why should
I believe you?

14:57.287 --> 14:58.253
Why should I believe
a fucking word

14:58.288 --> 14:59.788
that comes out of your mouth?

15:06.129 --> 15:08.263
Please.

15:08.298 --> 15:09.798
Please, Noah,

15:09.800 --> 15:10.932
forgive me, please.

15:10.967 --> 15:14.436
I never cheated on you.

15:14.471 --> 15:17.639
I came close.

15:17.691 --> 15:20.108
I never did.

15:25.699 --> 15:30.235
I had this stupid idea...

15:30.287 --> 15:33.488
...that you and I could make
a new start together

15:33.540 --> 15:38.493
and all the pain
we caused everybody else,

15:38.545 --> 15:40.295
it was for a reason because

15:40.330 --> 15:43.798
we were meant to be together.

15:43.834 --> 15:46.835
You were my one true love.

15:48.338 --> 15:50.004
I knew it was naive

15:50.006 --> 15:52.474
and people thought I was crazy,

15:52.509 --> 15:56.344
but I just didn't want to be
one of those suckers who gets...

15:56.396 --> 15:58.179
...trapped
in a miserable marriage

15:58.181 --> 16:00.515
and they're too...

16:00.517 --> 16:02.767
...fucking terrified to leave

16:02.819 --> 16:05.353
or they're drinking too much
or leaving a...

16:05.355 --> 16:07.522
leading a double life.

16:10.527 --> 16:12.360
I wanted to be brave
and make a choice

16:12.362 --> 16:14.696
and be happy.

16:17.834 --> 16:19.334
And yes, it was hard,

16:19.369 --> 16:21.453
and yes,

16:21.505 --> 16:25.006
I hurt people,

16:25.041 --> 16:27.542
people I really love.

16:31.214 --> 16:34.516
I never thought
it would be all...

16:34.551 --> 16:36.100
...pointless.

16:37.387 --> 16:40.388
Wait.
It's not pointless.

16:40.390 --> 16:41.556
Isn't it?

16:41.558 --> 16:43.358
Look, I...
I made a mistake.

16:43.393 --> 16:45.193
Maybe.

16:45.228 --> 16:46.661
Maybe <i>this</i> was the mistake.

16:46.696 --> 16:48.163
No, please,
don't say that.

16:48.198 --> 16:49.697
Maybe nothing's a mistake.

16:49.733 --> 16:51.366
Maybe it's all
just fucking meaningless,

16:51.401 --> 16:53.868
all these decisions that
we make ourselves sick over

16:53.904 --> 16:56.988
and these choices we think
are <i>so</i> important.

17:07.917 --> 17:12.753
Well, don't take this
the wrong way, but...

17:12.756 --> 17:15.924
...I never want
to see you again.

17:50.627 --> 17:53.761
What the fuck?

17:53.797 --> 17:54.762
I'm leaving.

17:54.798 --> 17:55.964
Oh, no, you're not.

17:55.966 --> 17:57.098
Helen, give me those keys.

17:57.133 --> 17:58.383
No, I saw what you just drank.

17:58.435 --> 18:00.134
Helen, give me
those fucking keys!

18:00.136 --> 18:01.135
Shh!

18:06.693 --> 18:08.443
Let's get out of here.

18:35.171 --> 18:37.438
Can I tell you
something awful?

18:37.474 --> 18:40.541
Please do.

18:40.577 --> 18:43.728
I never even
wanted Joanie.

18:46.566 --> 18:48.016
I was furious
with Alison

18:48.068 --> 18:49.767
when she told me
she was pregnant.

18:49.819 --> 18:53.354
I thought she had done it
deliberately to trap me,

18:53.406 --> 18:56.407
make sure I could never
go back to you.

18:59.863 --> 19:03.615
Were you even thinking
about going back to me?

19:03.667 --> 19:05.867
I always think about it,
Helen.

19:10.924 --> 19:14.459
Being back here
is so fucking strange.

19:14.511 --> 19:16.294
I was driving out here
this morning

19:16.346 --> 19:18.713
past the farm stands
and the windmills,

19:18.715 --> 19:22.016
and I felt the children
in the...

19:22.052 --> 19:25.219
behind me in the car.

19:25.271 --> 19:27.355
I felt you
sitting next to me.

19:27.390 --> 19:29.641
Even felt that pit
in my stomach

19:29.693 --> 19:32.393
I used to get when
we visited your parents.

19:32.395 --> 19:34.862
Had to remind myself
that wasn't my life anymore

19:34.898 --> 19:37.482
and to force myself
to remember Alison

19:37.534 --> 19:39.400
and Joanie and...

19:41.121 --> 19:43.154
It's like the last three years
never happened.

19:43.206 --> 19:44.822
They just evaporated.

19:51.247 --> 19:53.164
Sometimes I wake up
and I forget

19:53.216 --> 19:57.251
the past 25 years
ever happened.

19:57.253 --> 19:58.670
Are you trying
to cheer me up,

19:58.722 --> 20:01.089
or are you trying
to finish me off?

20:01.141 --> 20:02.674
I-I...

20:02.726 --> 20:05.560
I'm not sure yet.

20:05.595 --> 20:07.762
How's Vik?

20:07.764 --> 20:09.931
He's good.

20:09.933 --> 20:12.734
He just got a major job offer
in L.A.,

20:12.769 --> 20:14.185
at the Children's Hospital
there.

20:14.237 --> 20:16.437
- He gonna take it?
- I don't know.

20:16.489 --> 20:21.075
I think he is waiting
for me to...

20:21.111 --> 20:23.111
...tell him not to.

20:23.113 --> 20:24.112
And will you?

20:24.114 --> 20:25.363
I don't know.

20:27.617 --> 20:30.785
Noah,
I have no fucking clue.

20:30.837 --> 20:32.537
God, you'd have thought

20:32.589 --> 20:33.921
we'd be better
at this by now.

20:33.957 --> 20:35.206
What do you mean?

20:35.258 --> 20:36.624
Well, we're not
exactly young.

20:36.676 --> 20:38.042
I'd have thought
by this age,

20:38.094 --> 20:40.545
we might have figured
more things out.

20:40.597 --> 20:42.046
- You know, be more in control.
- Yeah.

20:42.098 --> 20:45.299
It does seem to be a sort
of never-ending shit show,

20:45.351 --> 20:46.551
doesn't it?

20:46.603 --> 20:48.886
Yeah.

20:48.938 --> 20:50.271
Mm.

20:53.276 --> 20:54.976
What are you doing?

20:54.978 --> 20:57.729
Can't keep talking about this.
I'll kill myself.

21:18.668 --> 21:20.918
Whoo!

21:26.976 --> 21:27.925
Aah!

21:39.022 --> 21:41.739
That's not conspicuous
at all.

21:43.359 --> 21:45.026
Keys...

21:45.028 --> 21:46.360
Do you have the keys?

21:46.362 --> 21:48.362
Where are your keys?

21:48.414 --> 21:49.864
Look, you drive.

21:49.916 --> 21:51.699
I can't drive.

21:51.751 --> 21:53.284
- You drive.
- I can't. I'm drunk.

21:53.336 --> 21:54.285
<i>I'm</i> drunk.

21:54.337 --> 21:56.454

21:56.506 --> 21:58.539

- Okay, okay.

21:58.591 --> 22:00.007

where are you staying?

22:00.043 --> 22:01.542

25:14.237 --> 25:15.603
Jeez!
Fuck!

25:15.638 --> 25:17.238
Fuck.
Pull over.

25:17.290 --> 25:18.906
- It was a deer.
- Pull over!

25:18.908 --> 25:20.541
- It was a deer.
- Helen, it wasn't a deer!

25:20.576 --> 25:21.375
Pull the fuck over,
Helen!

25:21.411 --> 25:22.743
It was a deer.

25:24.047 --> 25:25.079
- It was a deer.
- Fuck!

25:25.131 --> 25:27.715
It was a deer!

25:27.750 --> 25:28.582

- It's not a deer.

25:28.584 --> 25:30.217
Noah.
Noah!

Oh, fuck!

26:01.000 --> 26:03.617
Oh, God.

26:06.789 --> 26:07.788
Oh, f...

26:54.003 --> 26:57.505
Listen, I want you
to go inside.

26:57.540 --> 26:59.974
Take a shower
and go to bed, okay?

27:02.178 --> 27:04.678
Just forget this ever happened.

27:09.318 --> 27:12.720
Tell your mom you took
a cab home tonight

27:12.755 --> 27:16.490
and you never saw me.

27:19.829 --> 27:21.695
Okay?

27:25.601 --> 27:28.302
What are you gonna do?

27:37.079 --> 27:39.580
I'll figure it out.

27:43.419 --> 27:46.320
But I don't want you involved.

28:04.040 --> 28:05.840
I love you.

28:57.593 --> 28:59.593
Where'd he find it?

28:59.629 --> 29:02.663
At the scene of the crime.

29:02.698 --> 29:03.998
What does it prove?

29:04.033 --> 29:05.266
It doesn't prove anything.

29:05.301 --> 29:07.735
It suggests
that she was there.

29:10.439 --> 29:12.406
And this came
from Jeffries today?

29:12.441 --> 29:14.909
He presented it to
the prosecution this morning.

29:14.944 --> 29:17.061
Why?
W-why did he go back there?

29:17.113 --> 29:18.395
I don't know.

29:18.447 --> 29:19.647
Said he had
lingering suspicions.

29:19.699 --> 29:20.748
Couldn't sleep.

29:20.783 --> 29:22.149
About Alison?

29:22.201 --> 29:24.151
I did some research
a few weeks back,

29:24.203 --> 29:27.238
and something came up which
I was hoping, I was praying

29:27.290 --> 29:29.156
I wouldn't have to share
with you,

29:29.158 --> 29:32.243
but it doesn't look like
we have that option anymore.

29:34.630 --> 29:36.914
What is this?

29:39.335 --> 29:41.252
It's a DNA report.

29:41.304 --> 29:44.438
I had a sample
of Joanie's DNA analyzed.

29:44.473 --> 29:46.640
You're not her father.

29:46.676 --> 29:49.043
I'm sorry to have
to tell you that.

29:53.516 --> 29:55.849
I know that, Jon.

29:55.851 --> 29:56.850
What?

29:56.902 --> 29:58.953
Y-you...
you know?

29:58.988 --> 30:00.104
Why is this relevant?

30:03.659 --> 30:06.493
Well, uh...

30:06.529 --> 30:08.495
...I also have a video
of an altercation

30:08.531 --> 30:11.498
between Scotty and Alison
taken outside The Lobster Roll

30:11.534 --> 30:13.567
the night that Scott
was killed.

30:13.602 --> 30:15.703
I have phone records
wherein it shows

30:15.755 --> 30:17.705
he called her multiple times
in the months

30:17.757 --> 30:20.507
leading up to his death.

30:20.543 --> 30:22.793
I suspected that, perhaps,

30:22.845 --> 30:24.511
Scott was Joanie's father.

30:24.547 --> 30:25.879
Obviously, since
the report came back,

30:25.881 --> 30:27.214
I realized that isn't true.

30:27.266 --> 30:29.049
No. It's Cole.

30:31.721 --> 30:33.988
Right.

30:34.023 --> 30:37.057
Just what the test indicated.

30:38.394 --> 30:40.561
So I started to formulate
a hypothesis.

30:40.613 --> 30:45.566
Maybe Scott knew
Cole was Joanie's father.

30:45.568 --> 30:47.067
Maybe he was
blackmailing her.

30:47.119 --> 30:49.069
Maybe she killed him
to keep him quiet.

30:49.121 --> 30:51.572
Come on, Jon,
that... that's...

30:51.574 --> 30:52.906
that's ridiculous.

30:52.958 --> 30:54.541
Not to me.

30:54.577 --> 30:57.077
I can now put her
at the site

30:57.079 --> 30:59.079
on the night
of the accident.

30:59.081 --> 31:01.582
Hey, for all we know,
they got into another fight.

31:01.584 --> 31:03.684
She pushed him in front
of an oncoming car.

31:03.719 --> 31:04.668
I don't know.

31:04.720 --> 31:06.220
The point is
that I believe

31:06.255 --> 31:08.422
we have enough evidence now

31:08.424 --> 31:10.257
to build reasonable doubt
in the jurors' minds,

31:10.259 --> 31:11.425
enough to hang 'em

31:11.477 --> 31:15.062
or maybe even
to get you off entirely.

31:15.097 --> 31:18.065
By turning the blame
on Alison?

31:18.100 --> 31:21.685
Noah, look, I have been
doing this a long time,

31:21.737 --> 31:23.737
and I usually can feel

31:23.773 --> 31:26.607
which way a jury is leaning
in my bones.

31:26.659 --> 31:30.411
I do not have a good feeling
about this.

31:30.446 --> 31:31.912
We're running out of time.

31:31.947 --> 31:33.947
This is my Hail Mary pass.

31:33.999 --> 31:35.949
I have to put Detective Jeffries
on the stand.

31:36.001 --> 31:37.918
Now, what I'm asking you

31:37.953 --> 31:40.721
is, do I have your permission
to do that?

31:51.800 --> 31:55.136
_

31:56.839 --> 31:58.338
No, that's too much.

31:58.374 --> 31:59.807
I can get them from Danny
for two bucks less.

31:59.809 --> 32:00.808
Not for hard backs.

32:00.810 --> 32:02.142
I don't need
hard backs.

32:02.144 --> 32:03.310
Thought you said
this was a wedding.

32:03.312 --> 32:04.395
No, we're making salad.

32:04.447 --> 32:06.063
I need soft shells and culls.

32:06.115 --> 32:07.898
Listen, you said wedding.

32:07.950 --> 32:08.899
I thought you were doing
something special.

32:08.951 --> 32:09.817
Excuse me.

32:09.819 --> 32:11.235
Okay, Paulie,
how about

32:11.287 --> 32:12.486
you lose the attitude

32:12.538 --> 32:14.421
and you just give them to me
for eight?

32:14.457 --> 32:16.924
You insane?
Eleven.

32:16.959 --> 32:17.991
No way.
Eleven?

32:17.993 --> 32:19.626
I can just go
to the wholesaler.

32:19.662 --> 32:21.628
I know for a fact that Sysco
gives them to Danny for seven,

32:21.664 --> 32:22.663
so eight is a good deal.

32:22.665 --> 32:24.331
Not for these puppies.

32:24.383 --> 32:26.166
These are from my secret place.
They're sweeter.

32:26.168 --> 32:27.968
Your "secret place"?

32:28.003 --> 32:30.087
Fine.
You don't believe me?

32:30.139 --> 32:31.338
Go to Danny,

32:31.340 --> 32:33.090
<i>if</i> the DEC hasn't shut him down

32:33.142 --> 32:34.675
for selling undersized bugs.

32:34.727 --> 32:36.844
You'll be lucky to get
a half a pound off him,

32:36.846 --> 32:40.013
but hey, knock yourself out,
sweetheart.

32:40.065 --> 32:42.599
Okay, nine is my final offer.

32:42.651 --> 32:44.351
Make it ten,
you got a deal.

32:48.023 --> 32:49.990
Fine, ten.

32:50.025 --> 32:51.859
Good to have you back,
Bailey.

32:55.247 --> 32:56.697
Ugh.

32:56.699 --> 33:00.200
Who's the douche bag
in the Bimmer?

33:07.593 --> 33:08.959
When's
the actual opening?

33:09.011 --> 33:11.044
Uh, next week.

33:11.046 --> 33:12.546
You guys ready?

33:12.548 --> 33:14.965
Yeah, I think so.

33:15.017 --> 33:16.383
Who's gonna
look after the place

33:16.385 --> 33:20.804
when you come back
to the city?

33:20.856 --> 33:23.357
Uh, Luisa.

33:23.392 --> 33:27.194
Really?
They're not taking a honeymoon?

33:27.229 --> 33:28.729
Actually, they've, uh...

33:28.781 --> 33:32.366
they've asked me to stay on
a little longer.

33:32.401 --> 33:34.034
What?

33:34.069 --> 33:36.236
Well, just until they get back
from their honeymoon.

33:36.238 --> 33:39.072
- How long is that?
- Uh, a few weeks.

33:39.074 --> 33:41.008
A few weeks?

33:41.043 --> 33:43.160
Um, look,

33:43.212 --> 33:46.747
I've been meaning
to ask you, um...

33:46.799 --> 33:49.333
...Cole and I have an idea

33:49.385 --> 33:52.853
that maybe we can keep
the restaurant open all year.

33:52.888 --> 33:54.755
Uh, not full-time,
of course,

33:54.757 --> 33:58.592
just Thursday to Sunday.

33:58.594 --> 34:01.261
Okay.

34:01.263 --> 34:02.963
What do you think of that?

34:02.998 --> 34:05.349
Well, as long as you're just
a silent investor,

34:05.401 --> 34:07.935
it makes no difference to me.

34:09.237 --> 34:10.187
That was the agreement,
Alison.

34:10.239 --> 34:11.572
Yeah, I know.

34:11.607 --> 34:12.773
Y-you work out here
during the summer.

34:12.824 --> 34:15.074
- In the fall...
- I know.

34:15.110 --> 34:17.543
This was never supposed to turn
into a full-time gig.

34:17.580 --> 34:20.214
I know.

34:23.118 --> 34:26.786
So what are you trying
to tell me?

34:28.791 --> 34:31.091
Um...

34:31.126 --> 34:33.293
...I like it.

34:33.295 --> 34:35.262
What, you like being away
from us for half the week?

34:35.297 --> 34:36.964
Wait, no, I...

34:36.966 --> 34:38.799
I like the work.

34:38.801 --> 34:40.551
I booked a trip to Europe
in the fall.

34:40.603 --> 34:41.400
Remember?

34:41.437 --> 34:42.386
Yeah, I know,

34:42.438 --> 34:43.637
and it's fine.

34:43.688 --> 34:45.222
You can go,

34:45.274 --> 34:47.074
and I'll just bring Joanie
out here with me

34:47.109 --> 34:49.342
and Gigi too, and...

34:49.378 --> 34:50.811
You know, you'd be free

34:50.813 --> 34:52.478
to do all the writing
you want, you...

34:54.617 --> 34:55.899
Uh, who is it?

34:55.951 --> 34:59.486
Luisa.

34:59.488 --> 35:01.822
Look, let's talk
about this tonight.

35:01.874 --> 35:03.624
Can we?

35:03.659 --> 35:05.259
W-we can leave as soon
as the ceremony is over

35:05.294 --> 35:06.460
and we can go back
to the hotel.

35:06.495 --> 35:07.578
- Yeah, fine, whatever.
- No.

35:07.630 --> 35:10.130
Look, we can...

35:12.735 --> 35:15.252
- I'm looking for Alison.
- She's right there.

35:15.304 --> 35:17.170
Hey.
Did I interrupt something?

35:17.172 --> 35:19.606
No, no, it's fine.

35:19.642 --> 35:21.174
Is it still okay
for me to change here?

35:21.226 --> 35:22.676
No, of course.
Come in.

35:22.678 --> 35:25.262
Put your stuff down here.

35:30.569 --> 35:32.185
Today's gonna be wonderful,
I promise.

35:32.237 --> 35:33.904
Thank you.

35:38.193 --> 35:41.111
<i>Testing.
One, two, three.</i>

35:41.163 --> 35:42.996
<i>Testing.</i>

35:43.032 --> 35:46.450
<i>One, two, three.</i>

35:49.254 --> 35:51.872
<i>Marco?</i>

35:51.874 --> 35:53.874
<i>Marco?</i>

35:53.926 --> 35:56.043
Polo!

36:02.618 --> 36:04.651
I feel kind of hot

36:04.687 --> 36:07.421
and itchy, like, uh...
I don't know.

36:07.456 --> 36:10.157
Maybe you're having cold feet?

36:10.192 --> 36:11.725
No, no.
No, no.

36:11.760 --> 36:13.310
This... this feels physical,

36:13.362 --> 36:16.196
like I'm coming down
with something.

36:16.231 --> 36:17.564
Nope.
Feel fine to me.

36:17.566 --> 36:19.232
No, look.

36:19.284 --> 36:20.150
- Ah.
- Is it red?

36:20.202 --> 36:21.568
No.

36:21.620 --> 36:23.487
Are you sure?
'Cause it feels pretty sore.

36:23.539 --> 36:27.240
Y-yeah, I think
you'll feel fine tomorrow.

36:28.544 --> 36:30.077
Is her family here yet?

36:30.129 --> 36:32.412
- Yeah, some of them.
- Yeah.

36:32.414 --> 36:34.414
There's a lot of them.

36:34.466 --> 36:37.501
And they expect to spend
a lot of time with us.

36:37.553 --> 36:40.087
Well, then it's good you're here
and not back in the city.

36:40.089 --> 36:42.506
You know, she can be
a little irrational.

36:42.558 --> 36:44.007
Not a little irrational.
I mean...

36:44.059 --> 36:45.759
you know, most of the time,
we're good,

36:45.811 --> 36:47.060
I understand where
she's coming from,

36:47.096 --> 36:48.679
but sometimes she is
legitimately crazy.

36:48.731 --> 36:49.930
- What, Luisa?
- Yeah.

36:49.932 --> 36:51.398
I find that hard to imagine.
Why...

36:51.433 --> 36:52.766
No, she says
she's affected by

36:52.818 --> 36:53.934
the cycles of the moon,
which I thought

36:53.936 --> 36:55.852
was bullshit,
but she's right.

36:55.904 --> 36:57.604
I mean, every full moon,
she's like...

36:57.656 --> 37:00.857
she's completely emotional;
she makes no sense.

37:00.909 --> 37:03.744
Okay, well, that's only
a few days a month.

37:11.286 --> 37:13.537
She can't have kids.

37:15.591 --> 37:17.257
Did you know that?

37:19.678 --> 37:21.628
No.

37:21.630 --> 37:23.964
I didn't.

37:23.966 --> 37:26.266
Yeah.

37:31.940 --> 37:33.306
Well,

37:33.358 --> 37:37.411
you have... you have talked
about it, right?

37:37.446 --> 37:39.896
Not really.
No.

37:39.948 --> 37:41.615
We talked...

37:41.650 --> 37:42.816
...around it.

37:42.818 --> 37:45.285
You know, maybe...

37:45.320 --> 37:46.920
...adopt in a couple years,

37:46.955 --> 37:48.488
which...

37:48.490 --> 37:51.458
...I said I was cool with,
but...

37:55.130 --> 37:56.630
I think I always thought

37:56.665 --> 37:59.499
I was gonna get to be
a father again...

38:01.053 --> 38:03.336
...and I'd get another shot
to be a dad

38:03.338 --> 38:06.673
and not fuck it up this time,

38:06.708 --> 38:10.477
to be more...

38:10.512 --> 38:13.013
...careful.

38:26.195 --> 38:28.195
Cole, I...

38:28.247 --> 38:30.831
Do you love her?

38:30.866 --> 38:32.299
- Yes.
- Are you sure?

38:32.334 --> 38:34.117
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, yeah.

38:36.255 --> 38:40.624
I mean, I was sure
once before too.

38:40.676 --> 38:42.175
Yeah, well...

38:42.211 --> 38:44.294
...you and I were so young,

38:44.346 --> 38:46.480
and we didn't know
what we were doing.

38:48.617 --> 38:52.853
And then we were dealt
the world's worst hand and...

38:52.888 --> 38:55.055
...we folded.

38:57.392 --> 39:00.560
But this is not
the same thing.

39:00.562 --> 39:01.895
You're a man now.

39:01.897 --> 39:03.029
You know what you want,

39:03.065 --> 39:05.232
and you know
how to protect it.

39:05.284 --> 39:08.735
Y-you can wait five, ten,
20 years

39:08.737 --> 39:10.036
for the perfect girl
to come along

39:10.072 --> 39:12.739
to give you the perfect child,
but...

39:12.791 --> 39:15.742
...what if she never shows up?

39:17.579 --> 39:22.499
This is your chance
to be happy again, Cole.

39:22.551 --> 39:24.084
You should take it.

39:39.234 --> 39:41.768
Beautiful.

39:41.820 --> 39:44.437
Beautiful.
You look great.

39:44.439 --> 39:46.356
All right, can we get
a little happy one?

39:46.408 --> 39:47.941
Oh, that's good.
That's great.

39:47.943 --> 39:50.043
That's... yep.

39:50.078 --> 39:52.696
All right, let's have the
wedding party come in over here.

39:52.748 --> 39:54.414
Come on in, ladies.

39:57.286 --> 39:58.919
All the family.

40:03.792 --> 40:06.226
All right, guys,
let's get a photo of everyone.

40:06.261 --> 40:08.461

40:53.392 --> 40:56.309
- Look, it's Scott.
- Oh!

40:56.345 --> 40:58.278
Hey, what's up, man?

41:07.489 --> 41:09.189
Hey.

41:09.191 --> 41:11.441
I know you're busy,
but can we talk for a second?

41:11.493 --> 41:14.110
Uh, yeah, yeah, of course.

41:14.162 --> 41:17.163

Listen, I've been, uh...

41:28.427 --> 41:30.293
I've been thinking
about it, and, uh,

41:30.345 --> 41:33.046
this isn't gonna work
for me.

41:33.048 --> 41:34.631
Wh... what isn't gonna work?

41:34.683 --> 41:36.383
You staying out here
and commuting to the city.

41:36.385 --> 41:38.685
It's just... I...

41:38.720 --> 41:41.521
That wasn't the deal,
Alison.

41:41.556 --> 41:43.690
You were coming out here
till Labor Day,

41:43.725 --> 41:45.392
helping fix the place up,
and then come home.

41:45.444 --> 41:46.893
- Yeah, I know.
- That was the deal.

41:46.945 --> 41:50.363
- Yeah, I know.
- Well, I want you to come home.

41:50.399 --> 41:53.233
I want to raise
Joanie together.

41:53.235 --> 41:55.535
I want to get married.

41:55.570 --> 41:57.404
- Do you?
- Yeah.

41:57.456 --> 41:58.905
Of course, don't you?

41:58.957 --> 42:02.075
I...

42:02.077 --> 42:04.711
Come on, Alison.

42:04.746 --> 42:06.579
I love you.

42:06.581 --> 42:08.415
You love me.
We got a kid together.

42:08.417 --> 42:11.251
Let's stop making things
so difficult for ourselves.

42:11.303 --> 42:14.754
Let's get married
and settle down,

42:14.806 --> 42:18.425
be happy, be normal,
raise a family.

42:18.427 --> 42:21.227
Isn't that what you want?

42:21.263 --> 42:24.764
Yeah, of course I do.

42:30.272 --> 42:32.939
Hey, look at this.

42:32.941 --> 42:36.076
Joanie, this morning.

43:00.202 --> 43:04.270
Luisa, I promise
I will be faithful to you

43:04.306 --> 43:07.006
with my body
and with my heart.

43:07.042 --> 43:08.975
I will stay open to you,

43:09.010 --> 43:11.511
and I will bring you
into my confidence.

43:11.546 --> 43:13.813
I promise I will never
make an important decision

43:13.815 --> 43:16.483
without consulting you first.

43:16.535 --> 43:18.918
I want you to trust me
above all others,

43:18.954 --> 43:22.255
and I want to be worthy
of your trust.

43:22.290 --> 43:23.790
I will support your dreams,

43:23.825 --> 43:25.925
and I will give you
the space and the freedom

43:25.961 --> 43:28.094
to turn them into reality.

43:28.130 --> 43:30.964
And I promise to show you
each day how lucky I am

43:30.999 --> 43:33.199
to have you in my life.

43:33.235 --> 43:35.752
Cole, I promise to seek

43:35.804 --> 43:37.604
a deep understanding
of your wishes,

43:37.639 --> 43:39.839
your desires,
and your dreams.

43:39.891 --> 43:43.009
I promise to be there
for whenever you need me.

43:43.061 --> 43:45.145
I promise to keep
our lives exciting,

43:45.180 --> 43:47.597
passionate,
and full of adventure.

44:41.236 --> 44:44.537
Scott?
Hey.

44:44.573 --> 44:46.739
Can I get you anything?
A soda?

44:46.741 --> 44:49.075
Alison Bailey,

44:49.127 --> 44:51.411
you are a sight
for sore eyes.

44:52.714 --> 44:54.497
God, can I get a hug?

44:54.549 --> 44:55.715
Yeah.

44:55.750 --> 44:56.749
Mm.

44:58.920 --> 45:00.553
Wow, you look great.

45:00.589 --> 45:03.756
Oh, come on, now,
you... really,

45:03.758 --> 45:06.426
you... you look terrific.

45:06.478 --> 45:09.395
Thank you.
That's so sweet of you.

45:09.431 --> 45:12.432
I'm actually glad that I
caught you alone for a second.

45:12.434 --> 45:15.351
I, um...

45:15.403 --> 45:19.439
I-I owe you an apology,

45:19.491 --> 45:22.192
like, a big one.

45:22.244 --> 45:25.195
My behavior the last time
we were together,

45:25.247 --> 45:28.081
it was, uh...

45:28.116 --> 45:30.450
it was inexcusable.

45:30.485 --> 45:34.454
I-I was...
I was out of my mind.

45:34.506 --> 45:38.958
So I-I hope you can
understand that

45:38.960 --> 45:42.095
and can maybe forgive me,

45:42.130 --> 45:44.547
'cause I'm...

45:44.599 --> 45:47.767
I'm really sorry.

45:52.641 --> 45:55.308
Yeah, of course, Scott.

45:55.360 --> 45:57.477
Come here.

45:57.529 --> 45:59.479
- Thank you, thank you.
- Mm.

45:59.531 --> 46:00.580
Thank you.

46:03.151 --> 46:05.318
Oh, man, I got to tell you.

46:05.320 --> 46:07.620
Rehab was... was rough.

46:07.656 --> 46:08.655
Yeah, I bet, wow.

46:08.657 --> 46:10.590
Yeah, I mean, the whole thing,

46:10.625 --> 46:14.494
it was the pain,
the sweating, the itching,

46:14.496 --> 46:16.996
countless hours
just laying in bed

46:16.998 --> 46:19.582
staring at the ceiling
and just thinking

46:19.634 --> 46:21.417
that the world
was gonna end,

46:21.469 --> 46:24.837
and I don't think that
I could've gotten through

46:24.889 --> 46:28.141
all that if it weren't
for this place.

46:29.811 --> 46:31.144
This place?

46:31.179 --> 46:33.313
Yeah, it was like
this beacon of hope

46:33.348 --> 46:34.597
throughout
that whole process.

46:34.649 --> 46:36.649
Hey, what's going on
over here?

46:36.685 --> 46:39.936
There he is,
the man of the hour.

46:41.072 --> 46:43.022
Oh, congratulations again, man.

46:43.024 --> 46:44.157
Thank you.

46:44.192 --> 46:46.359
Your... your vows were just
awesome.

46:46.361 --> 46:48.611
I may have even teared up
a little bit.

46:51.032 --> 46:52.615
Everything okay?

46:52.667 --> 46:56.002
Yeah, he was just saying
how important this place was

46:56.037 --> 46:57.620
during rehab.

46:59.257 --> 47:00.456
Oh, yeah?

47:00.508 --> 47:03.209
Yeah, man, really,
I was just...

47:03.211 --> 47:05.545
I was trying
to say thank you.

47:05.547 --> 47:08.348
I... knowing that you guys
believed in me

47:08.383 --> 47:11.184
and wanting to make me
a partner when I got clean,

47:11.219 --> 47:13.853
it... it... it saved me.

47:13.888 --> 47:15.305
- Oh.
- I mean, it saved my life.

47:15.357 --> 47:19.726
No, no, no, seriously,
you guys saved my life.

47:19.728 --> 47:21.394
We're just happy
that you're better.

47:21.446 --> 47:23.363
You gave us a hell
of a scare there, Scott.

47:23.398 --> 47:24.814
No, I know I did, and...

47:24.866 --> 47:27.483
and I'm gonna go back
for another month

47:27.535 --> 47:30.069
and, you know,
dot my Is, cross my Ts,

47:30.121 --> 47:31.838
make sure that
I'm free and clear,

47:31.873 --> 47:35.408
but I want you guys to know
that I am fully available

47:35.460 --> 47:37.076
for... for whatever you need.

47:37.128 --> 47:39.746
I-I can call in to meetings.
You can send me figures.

47:39.798 --> 47:40.913
Whatever you...

47:40.965 --> 47:43.166
I mean,
we got that covered.

47:43.218 --> 47:44.751
Right?
I mean, we'll be fine.

47:44.803 --> 47:46.252
I think the best thing that you
can do is go back there,

47:46.304 --> 47:48.504
take as much time as you need,
get healthy,

47:48.556 --> 47:50.757
and then, you know,
when you come out for good,

47:50.759 --> 47:53.760
then we can discuss
our arrangement here.

47:56.598 --> 48:00.266
Arrangement?

48:00.318 --> 48:03.102
What do you mean by that?

48:05.407 --> 48:06.906
You know, Scott,
I don't think this

48:06.941 --> 48:08.608
is the most appropriate place
for this...

48:08.660 --> 48:09.776
No, no, no, no, no,
you're right.

48:09.828 --> 48:10.777
You're totally right.

48:10.829 --> 48:13.446
But, um...

48:13.498 --> 48:16.416
...the... the deal is still
in place, right?

48:16.451 --> 48:19.752
I mean, we, uh... we just got
to hammer out the details,

48:19.788 --> 48:23.956
but I'm still a partner
in this, correct?

48:23.958 --> 48:25.591
What the fuck did you think
was gonna happen, Scott?

48:25.627 --> 48:27.043
You're gonna go to rehab
for three months

48:27.095 --> 48:28.127
and then you just walk back
into our lives

48:28.129 --> 48:29.629
and everything's forgiven?

48:29.681 --> 48:30.797
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
wait a second here.

48:30.799 --> 48:31.964
Cole...

48:32.016 --> 48:33.132
I am just going off
of what you said.

48:33.134 --> 48:34.467
You said that if
I went to rehab,

48:34.519 --> 48:36.102
if I did...
if I did the work...

48:36.137 --> 48:38.771
And got yourself clean,
really clean, for good.

48:38.807 --> 48:39.972
Cole, I am clean.

48:40.024 --> 48:41.474
Good, then do it
for six months.

48:41.526 --> 48:43.393
Do it for a year.
Then we can talk.

48:43.445 --> 48:44.811
No, no, no, no.
That was not our deal.

48:44.863 --> 48:46.562
Shut the fuck up
about this deal

48:46.614 --> 48:48.648
like we were in a lawyer's
office signing papers.

48:48.650 --> 48:50.483
For fuck's sake, Scott,
you were drunk.

48:50.485 --> 48:52.235
You were high as a kite.

48:52.287 --> 48:54.153
I was trying to save your life,
get you to rehab.

48:54.155 --> 48:56.489
Cole.

48:56.541 --> 49:00.159
Don't ruin this
fucking day for me, okay?

49:55.450 --> 49:57.884
He just got scared.

49:57.919 --> 50:00.052
Scared of what?

50:00.104 --> 50:01.687
He doesn't handle
surprises well.

50:01.723 --> 50:04.557
He needs everything
to be in his control.

50:04.592 --> 50:08.311
Yeah, Ali, I've noticed that.

50:08.363 --> 50:11.397
Look, I think there's something
about what's happening to you

50:11.449 --> 50:14.367
that reminds him
of what happened to your dad.

50:21.125 --> 50:24.243
What, the failing
at everything?

50:28.416 --> 50:31.000

She's fine.

50:45.149 --> 50:46.599
Did you tell Cole yet?

50:46.651 --> 50:50.019
'Cause, you know,
she's a Lockhart, right?

50:50.071 --> 50:51.938
God, my mother didn't think
that it would be possible.

50:51.940 --> 50:53.239
Okay, good night, Scotty.

50:53.274 --> 50:56.409
Someone is going
to tell him, Ali,

50:56.444 --> 50:59.445
and it's either
you or me.

50:59.497 --> 51:01.447

That's our baby.

51:24.355 --> 51:26.305
You look a little pale.

51:28.359 --> 51:29.442
I'm fine.

51:40.705 --> 51:42.989
Hey, hey.

51:43.041 --> 51:44.407
This is Alison.
This is my girl.

51:44.459 --> 51:45.408
- Hi.
- Hi.

51:45.460 --> 51:47.159
Guess what they told me.

51:47.161 --> 51:49.662
There's a <i>Descent</i> tour
in Montauk right now.

51:49.664 --> 51:50.997
A tour?

51:50.999 --> 51:52.665
Yeah, of all the places

the docks, the ranch,

51:55.470 --> 51:56.669
this restaurant.

51:56.671 --> 51:57.970
Oh, you're kidding.

51:58.006 --> 51:59.505
No, I'm not.
Isn't it wild?

52:01.509 --> 52:05.845

52:39.113 --> 52:40.813

57:03.694 --> 57:05.861
Fancy meeting you here.

57:12.203 --> 57:13.619
What are you doing here?

57:13.654 --> 57:15.120
Well,

57:15.156 --> 57:19.325
I can't exactly
go back to rehab now, can I?

57:19.377 --> 57:21.961
So I thought I'd go
over to The End

57:21.996 --> 57:24.413
and see if I could get
my job back,

57:24.465 --> 57:27.166
but then I realized
that I'm inebriated,

57:27.218 --> 57:28.751
so...

57:28.803 --> 57:30.836
...um, I thought
I'd sleep it off

57:30.888 --> 57:33.339
in this here rowboat.

57:36.344 --> 57:38.844
Would you care to join me?

57:38.896 --> 57:41.647
No, Scotty.

57:43.401 --> 57:46.285
How about you cut me in?

57:46.320 --> 57:48.938
You just cut me in.

57:48.990 --> 57:52.524
I mean, you do own
half the place, right?

57:52.526 --> 57:55.327
So you could... you really
could do that

57:55.363 --> 57:56.996
if you wanted to, huh?

57:57.031 --> 57:59.698
And, uh... oh, I got an idea.

57:59.700 --> 58:01.283
Tell you what.

58:01.335 --> 58:05.621
You do this for me,
and I will just forget

58:05.673 --> 58:09.341
that I ever saw
your daughter.

58:09.377 --> 58:10.876
Yeah, how does that sound?

58:10.928 --> 58:12.461
Yeah, okay, Scotty,
you're really drunk.

58:12.513 --> 58:14.129
So how about I call you a cab?

58:14.181 --> 58:18.751
Why don't you just
answer the questions?

58:18.786 --> 58:21.420
Just answer the questions.

58:24.025 --> 58:25.557
I'll think about it.

58:28.396 --> 58:31.030
Are you just saying that?

58:32.633 --> 58:34.400
Yes.

59:01.762 --> 59:05.397

59:14.825 --> 59:17.810

59:17.845 --> 59:21.480

to sleep in the rowboat.

59:26.454 --> 59:30.289

Come on, Ali.

59:38.699 --> 59:41.216

in this town, why not me?

59:41.268 --> 59:42.217
