WEBVTT

00:00.160 --> 00:02.958
Their closeness stems
from a tragic bond.

00:03.080 --> 00:06.675
Both Joe and Jill's mothers
were killed by poachers
12 years ago in the Pangani Forest.

00:06.800 --> 00:10.873
- Bloody hell, that's him!
- They both became orphans
on the same night.

00:11.000 --> 00:13.639
That's the little fella
who bit your finger off!

00:17.240 --> 00:19.071
I'm always amazed how,

00:21.160 --> 00:26.678
if you wait long enough, the opportunity
for justice finally comes.

00:28.000 --> 00:30.594
Garth, book us two tickets
to America.

00:30.720 --> 00:34.076
We are going to pay a visit
to this incredible animal.

00:34.200 --> 00:38.591
I think I know how to convince
his current owners to part with him.

00:43.960 --> 00:46.428
Now, this fellow is
one of only 300 wild yaks...

00:46.560 --> 00:48.357
remaining on the planet.

00:48.480 --> 00:52.996
Now, you may ask: Why should we care
if this subspecies of yak survives?

00:53.120 --> 00:54.917
- But if we don't protect--
- Excuse me.

00:55.040 --> 00:57.110
- Can we see Joe?

00:57.240 --> 00:59.993
Yes, you can certainly
all see Joe for the mere price of...

01:00.120 --> 01:03.078
a diamond circle benefactor ticket
to tomorrow night's benefit.

01:03.200 --> 01:04.997
But, you know,
this is for a good cause.

01:05.120 --> 01:07.554
It's for the preservation
of an endangered species.

01:09.000 --> 01:15.074

01:54.440 --> 01:56.795
You remember, don't you?

02:07.440 --> 02:11.068
- This is what you call
a good meal in a fine restaurant?

02:11.200 --> 02:13.395
Yeah.

02:13.520 --> 02:17.308
It's my favourite restaurant
'cause they let you take off your shoes.

02:21.760 --> 02:24.991
My granddad used to bring me
fishing down here when I was a kid.

02:26.080 --> 02:28.594
Wow. The Pacific Ocean.

02:31.720 --> 02:33.790
That's nice. Live music.

02:33.920 --> 02:35.751
I hired him special.

02:37.240 --> 02:39.708
Ten minutes ago.
You wanna dance?

02:39.840 --> 02:43.719
What?
So, this is a date, or something?

02:43.840 --> 02:46.752
Not that I'd know.
I've never been on one before.

02:46.880 --> 02:49.678
Yeah, well, I guess most guys
are afraid of a girl's father.

02:49.800 --> 02:52.951
I can just see a guy telling Joe
he's gonna get you home by midnight.

02:53.080 --> 02:57.676
Well, nobody's ever had to tell Joe
what time they'll have me home by.

03:02.560 --> 03:04.312
What's it like?

03:04.440 --> 03:05.953
"lt"?

03:06.080 --> 03:10.710
Yeah. This whole dating,
dancing, love thing.

03:10.840 --> 03:13.593
Well, it's...

03:13.720 --> 03:16.473
kind of like being bit
by a Makiki spider.

03:19.680 --> 03:21.591
And how's that?

03:21.720 --> 03:24.473
- You get kind of a fever.
- Fever?

03:24.600 --> 03:26.397
Ah. And then?

03:26.520 --> 03:30.035
And then you--
you find yourself saying things.

03:30.160 --> 03:31.957
Lots of things.

03:32.080 --> 03:33.911
What kind of things?

03:34.040 --> 03:35.837
Things like--

03:41.880 --> 03:43.677
- What is it?

03:43.800 --> 03:45.756
I'm sorry.
It's this thing.

03:47.520 --> 03:49.511
We gotta go.

04:01.880 --> 04:03.677
I don't understand
this animal.

04:03.800 --> 04:06.678
- He's got everything he wants.
Why can't he just relax?
- Harry, stop. Oh.

04:06.800 --> 04:08.597
He's ripping out saplings,
bam, bam, bam!

04:08.720 --> 04:10.517
- Taking out irrigation pipe.
- Really? Oh.

04:10.640 --> 04:12.437
One big yank,
here comes the flood.

04:12.560 --> 04:15.313
- What happened? What's wrong with him?
- We don't know. Jill, do you?

04:15.440 --> 04:17.635
- Is he okay?

04:17.760 --> 04:20.478
- Can you get in there
and calm him down...
- Joe?

04:20.600 --> 04:22.397
before he relandscapes
the habitat?

04:31.720 --> 04:34.075
Joe, it's okay.

04:42.560 --> 04:44.391
It's okay.

06:14.080 --> 06:16.435
- Impossible.
- Please.

06:16.560 --> 06:18.676
I wouldn't be asking you
to postpone the benefit...

06:18.800 --> 06:21.075
unless I thought there was
something really wrong with Joe.

06:21.200 --> 06:23.236
And I do.

06:23.360 --> 06:27.751
From what I hear, you sang him to sleep
last night like a baby.

06:27.880 --> 06:30.155
What's really wrong
about that?

06:30.280 --> 06:34.956
Mr Baker, I swear to you,
Joe is still not himself.

06:35.080 --> 06:36.957
He's nervous and agitated,

06:37.080 --> 06:39.594
and he shouldn't be exposed
to a crowd of strangers right now.

06:39.720 --> 06:42.393
If you can just delay the party
just a few more--

06:42.520 --> 06:44.511
- It's too late, Jill.
- No!

06:47.600 --> 06:51.229
- It's too soon.
- Miss Young,
let me give you some advice:

06:51.360 --> 06:53.999
Stop worrying about Joe,

06:54.120 --> 06:57.396
and start worrying about what
you will wear to the party tonight.

07:14.360 --> 07:17.636
- Cecily?

07:17.760 --> 07:19.716
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- No, my fault.

07:19.840 --> 07:23.469
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

07:23.600 --> 07:25.352
It's just--

07:27.320 --> 07:30.596
- What?
- You must be Jill Young.

07:30.720 --> 07:32.597
Yes?

07:32.720 --> 07:36.235
And you look just like her.

07:38.080 --> 07:40.355
- Who?
- Your mother.

07:45.440 --> 07:48.716
- You knew my mother?
- Yes.

07:48.840 --> 07:51.832
I'm an old friend
of your mother's.

07:51.960 --> 07:55.714
I knew her when she was, uh,
only a little older than you.

07:55.840 --> 07:58.308
- And you were just a tiny thing.
- Oh.

07:59.440 --> 08:03.911
- What an incredible woman she was.
- Yeah.

08:04.040 --> 08:06.270
I'm sorry.
I'm Andre Strasser.

08:06.400 --> 08:10.439
I've come here
to talk with your Mr Baker.

08:10.560 --> 08:14.030
- Actually, I'm here for Joe.
- Joe?

08:14.160 --> 08:16.390
And, in a way,
for your mother too.

08:16.520 --> 08:18.317
I believe she would agree with me.

08:18.440 --> 08:21.193
A magnificent wild animal
like Joe needs more space,

08:21.320 --> 08:24.039
Iike the Raja Preserve
I run in Botswana.

08:24.160 --> 08:26.435
Raja Preserve?

08:26.560 --> 08:29.074
It's 20,000 acres there...

08:29.200 --> 08:32.158
where the animals
are free to run.

08:32.280 --> 08:37.433
Here it's such a shame to see Joe
living in a man-made habitat...

08:37.559 --> 08:40.393
and being used as
an attraction to raise money.

08:41.679 --> 08:43.989
But I upset you.

08:44.120 --> 08:45.917
- No.
- Please.

08:46.040 --> 08:48.634
I only mean to offer
an alternative.

08:51.000 --> 08:54.436
Anyway, here is my card.

08:54.560 --> 08:57.313
I'll be attending
the event tonight.

08:57.440 --> 08:59.556
Maybe we can talk more
about this matter then.

08:59.680 --> 09:01.910
I look forward to it.

09:03.240 --> 09:05.071
Yeah. Bye.

09:15.120 --> 09:17.873
Boy, I can't believe
all the V.I.P.s here tonight.

09:18.000 --> 09:20.833
Ooh, don't you clean up nice?

09:20.960 --> 09:23.997
- Cecily, you look ravishing.
- Thank you.

09:24.120 --> 09:27.635
Harry, you got a little, um,
cocktail sauce on your shirt there.

09:27.760 --> 09:30.718
Oh, great.
Now I look ridiculous.

09:30.840 --> 09:34.719
No, you look fine.
They look ridiculous.

09:34.840 --> 09:36.956
- Uh-huh.
- Yeah, well, she doesn't.

09:48.120 --> 09:50.634
I picked out the dress.
Aren't I smart?

09:50.760 --> 09:52.751
Brilliant.

09:54.080 --> 09:56.150
Harry, you're dripping again.

09:56.280 --> 09:58.635
Oh, look at me.
I'm a mess here.

09:58.760 --> 10:00.557
You know, I have to give
a speech tonight.

10:00.680 --> 10:02.511
You think anyone'll notice?

10:02.640 --> 10:04.790
No.

10:05.880 --> 10:07.757
Hi.

10:07.880 --> 10:10.758
I feel so stupid
in this dress.

10:10.880 --> 10:12.677
You look anything but stupid.

10:12.800 --> 10:14.597
Come on,
let's get a drink.

10:15.840 --> 10:17.796
She reminds me of somebody,

10:17.920 --> 10:20.309
but...
I can't think who it is.

10:20.440 --> 10:22.795
You, when we first met.

10:24.000 --> 10:25.956
Why are they staring at me?

10:26.080 --> 10:30.517
They're not staring at you, they're
staring at, uh, that banana tower.

10:31.840 --> 10:33.637
- Very funny.

10:34.720 --> 10:36.517
Come on.

10:39.800 --> 10:42.872
It's nice to see you all.
Good evening.

10:43.000 --> 10:45.275
- Quite a turnout.
- All the better.

10:45.400 --> 10:47.789
Ladies and gentlemen,
would you please take your seats?

10:47.920 --> 10:51.071
Please. Can I have
your attention, please?

10:51.200 --> 10:53.873
Can I have your attention, please?

10:54.000 --> 10:56.992
- Take your seats.
- Ooh, I'm sorry. Oh.

10:57.120 --> 10:59.395
Excuse me, sir, you, uh,
dropped your, uh--

10:59.520 --> 11:01.590
- Key chain.
- Ah, of course.

11:01.720 --> 11:04.553
Garth, you would lose your head
if it wasn't screwed on.

11:05.720 --> 11:07.711
- Nice party, huh?

11:07.840 --> 11:10.638
Just take your seats.
- Where do we think he's from?

11:10.760 --> 11:14.196
- I don't know.
- I'm Elliot Baker.

11:14.320 --> 11:17.153
The world was once
a garden teeming with life.

11:17.280 --> 11:21.159
A wondrous place to contemplate
creation in all its--

11:40.920 --> 11:43.718
- So, you haven't forgotten me?
Can I have your attention?

11:43.840 --> 11:45.796
As you can hear, the secret...

11:45.920 --> 11:48.195
- announced itself loud and clear.
- Good.

11:48.320 --> 11:50.629
Have you forgotten this?

12:04.120 --> 12:06.680
How much do you think he's worth,
couple of million?

12:06.800 --> 12:11.157
After we sell him off,
piece by piece,

12:11.280 --> 12:13.396
who knows how much we'll make?

12:15.440 --> 12:18.512
- Ah, that got you going.

12:18.640 --> 12:21.473
Now be a good boy
and frighten the ladies.

12:21.600 --> 12:25.195
Can I have your attention?
Our guest seems to be telling you...

12:25.320 --> 12:28.596
- that I'm talking too long.
- Okay, let's go.
We've done our job here.

12:28.720 --> 12:32.076
I'd like to bring up to the podium
the director of our conservancy--

12:34.400 --> 12:39.394
Well, I suppose there's no need
to add to that introduction.

12:39.520 --> 12:41.590
Here's Dr Harry Ruben!

12:46.400 --> 12:49.551
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

12:49.680 --> 12:51.636
In the time it took you
to drive here tonight,

12:51.760 --> 12:55.514
three species have disappeared
from the Earth.

12:55.640 --> 12:59.076
Extinct. Never to be replaced.

13:00.440 --> 13:02.749
We here at the conservancy
say this is a tragedy--

13:05.040 --> 13:08.032
Well, uh, obviously Joe agrees.

13:08.160 --> 13:11.038
- There's something wrong.
- But, um,

13:11.160 --> 13:14.755
tonight, instead of focusing
on what we've lost,

13:14.880 --> 13:17.713
we'd like to introduce you
to something that we've found.

13:17.840 --> 13:22.118
Ladies and gentlemen, behind
this curtain is the newest member...

13:22.240 --> 13:25.312
of the California Animal Conservancy.

13:25.440 --> 13:29.149
We are very happy and proud
to introduce to you,

13:29.280 --> 13:32.317
- Mighty Joe--

13:40.160 --> 13:42.037
- Joe?

13:44.160 --> 13:45.957
It's okay.

13:47.440 --> 13:50.352
Come on, Joe.

13:53.920 --> 13:56.878
No! Joe!

14:13.840 --> 14:15.717
My God, what's wrong with him?

14:15.840 --> 14:18.070
He's out of control!
I'm going for the tranq gun!

14:18.200 --> 14:20.350
No, Gregg!
I'll stop him!

14:29.360 --> 14:32.079
- Oh, my God!

14:33.120 --> 14:34.997
Move!

14:45.520 --> 14:48.353
Oh, God.

15:12.800 --> 15:14.916
The gorilla
literally crashed the party.

15:15.040 --> 15:16.996
Officials here at the conservancy
are saying...

15:17.120 --> 15:19.873
they don't know what caused
the animal's rampage.

15:20.000 --> 15:22.036
More than a dozen people
were injured.

15:22.160 --> 15:24.390
Eight of them remain
hospitalized today.

15:24.520 --> 15:26.590
In fact, three lawsuits
have been filed so far,

15:26.720 --> 15:30.918
and word has it the city's
attorney is calling for
the animal to be put to sleep.

15:31.040 --> 15:34.032
Standing with me is the conservancy
board's chairman, Elliot Baker.

15:34.160 --> 15:38.278
Exactly what is being done to assure
the public that Joe won't attack again?

15:38.400 --> 15:42.439
Joe has been transferred to a special
steel-reinforced concrete bunker.

15:42.560 --> 15:44.357
But what about
when you let him out?

15:44.480 --> 15:47.199
That won't be happening any time soon.

15:47.320 --> 15:50.198
In fact, I want to make it clear
that we will be doing...

15:50.320 --> 15:53.551
anything necessary to ensure
the safety of the public.

15:53.680 --> 15:56.672
With the number of
lawsuits the conservancy is now facing,

15:56.800 --> 15:59.553
will you shut down the facility
to the public?

16:01.760 --> 16:03.591
Joe.

16:07.320 --> 16:09.675
I'm right here. Okay?

16:14.000 --> 16:16.036
I knew there was
something wrong with him.

16:16.160 --> 16:18.469
What do you think
happened out there?

16:20.040 --> 16:23.396
Joe would have never hurt
those people unprovoked.

16:23.520 --> 16:25.351
Something must've got to him.

16:30.360 --> 16:32.157
- Jill?

16:33.640 --> 16:36.438
Could l, um, talk to you for a second?

16:53.640 --> 16:56.438
Well, this wasn't
in the brochure, was it?

17:04.160 --> 17:06.913
I promised you wouldn't be
put in a cage.

17:09.440 --> 17:12.079
I'm sorry, Joe.

17:51.880 --> 17:54.917
Then the city attorney
talked to Baker.

17:55.040 --> 17:57.634
- I had nothing to do with this.
- With what?

17:57.760 --> 18:01.070
Joe's gonna have to stay in here
until they decide
what they're gonna do with him.

18:01.200 --> 18:02.997
- In here?
- Yeah.

18:03.120 --> 18:04.917
Harry, look at him.

18:05.040 --> 18:06.837
He's depressed.
He won't eat.

18:06.960 --> 18:10.316
If he stays in here,
he'll die within days.

18:10.440 --> 18:12.431
There is nothing we can do.

18:12.560 --> 18:15.074
Either you tell them you're getting
Joe out of here, or I will.

18:15.200 --> 18:17.714
This is way beyond
you and me.

18:17.840 --> 18:19.910
Joe freaked out on some
very influential people.

18:20.040 --> 18:21.951
Now he's a public relations nightmare.

18:22.080 --> 18:25.197
No zoo will take
a 2,000-pound killer gorilla!

18:25.320 --> 18:27.436
- He's not a killer!
- Okay, okay.

18:27.560 --> 18:29.835
But unless you can write a cheque
for millions of dollars...

18:29.960 --> 18:31.871
and find him
a big backyard somewhere,

18:32.000 --> 18:33.877
then Joe's got nowhere to go.

18:34.000 --> 18:36.389
I'm sorry.

18:37.520 --> 18:40.193
Harry.

18:40.320 --> 18:43.471
You're not gonna do anything?

19:08.000 --> 19:09.752
I need your help.

19:15.040 --> 19:16.837
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

19:16.960 --> 19:19.713
- You can't go in there.
- It's okay. We're here
to give Joe more sedatives.

19:19.840 --> 19:21.637
Wha-- I, uh--

19:21.760 --> 19:24.513
Unless you want him
to get frisky on your shift,

19:24.640 --> 19:27.950
I suggest you let us get on with our job
so you can get on with yours.

19:42.640 --> 19:44.198
Come on, Joe.

19:44.320 --> 19:45.878
We're leaving.

19:46.000 --> 19:47.228
- Yeah.

19:47.360 --> 19:49.794
Let's get you out of here.

19:51.040 --> 19:53.235
- What the hell are you doin'?

19:55.120 --> 19:58.749
The gorilla needs medication,
and I've gotta take him
over to the clinic for that.

19:58.880 --> 20:02.190
- Who says?
- Doctor's orders, and I'm the doctor.

20:02.320 --> 20:05.198
Yeah, well, uh,
I take my orders from Mr Baker,

20:05.320 --> 20:08.073
so, uh, put him back
in his cage now.

20:08.200 --> 20:10.270
- Easy, Joe, easy.

20:12.320 --> 20:15.596
Officer, you don't want to point
that thing at him, believe me.

20:22.400 --> 20:24.118
He didn't believe you.

20:37.000 --> 20:39.798
Okay, come on!
Bring him out!

20:47.360 --> 20:50.193
Come on, big guy.
Come on.

21:01.600 --> 21:04.353
Come on, Joe.
Into the truck.

21:04.480 --> 21:06.789
That's it.

21:09.280 --> 21:11.111
Okay.

21:13.200 --> 21:14.997
Thanks.

21:23.520 --> 21:26.318
I am gonna miss
those big ol' brown eyes.

21:28.640 --> 21:30.437
You be good, Joe.

21:30.560 --> 21:32.869
Goodbye, Joe.

21:33.000 --> 21:36.231
I was just starting to get
the hang of hide-and-seek.

21:38.280 --> 21:43.513
I, uh, I think you should be
all right up here at the gate.

21:43.640 --> 21:47.872
Someone, uh, just called the guard away.
Urgent business.

21:49.280 --> 21:51.589
You came through for us, Harry.

21:54.200 --> 21:56.794
- Thank you.
- Good luck.

22:01.800 --> 22:05.031
You be sure to write us
as soon as you get Joe settled, okay?

22:05.160 --> 22:07.435
I promise.

22:08.680 --> 22:10.716
Okay. You're all set.

22:10.840 --> 22:12.990
So, you're gonna...

22:13.120 --> 22:15.680
come to the airport,
or--

22:15.800 --> 22:18.553
No, I'm gonna hang back and make sure
nobody notices Joe's gone,

22:18.680 --> 22:21.433
give you guys a chance
to make a run for it.

22:21.560 --> 22:23.551
Okay.

22:23.680 --> 22:27.673
If you're ever in Botswana and
feel like taking me out for a
good meal at a fine restaurant--

22:27.800 --> 22:31.759
That is, if you're not too afraid
to let Joe know what time you'll be--

22:41.560 --> 22:45.109
Jill, we should go now.
The plane is waiting.

22:46.880 --> 22:48.950
Come.
Let's go.

22:49.080 --> 22:51.674
- Gotta go.
- Yeah.

23:05.880 --> 23:08.872
- Hello.
- Hi.

23:14.560 --> 23:16.357
Don't worry, Jill.

23:16.480 --> 23:19.074
Soon Joe will be
back home again.

23:27.880 --> 23:29.677
So, what do you think?

23:29.800 --> 23:32.553
How many minutes before the whole world
knows he's missing?

23:32.680 --> 23:34.477
- Five.
- Hmph.

23:34.600 --> 23:39.435
- How many minutes before
we're both looking through the want ads?
- Six.

23:40.840 --> 23:42.637
What are you guys doin' here?

23:42.760 --> 23:44.478
What are you guys
doin' here?

23:44.600 --> 23:47.194
Baker wants us to clean up
the tent A.S.A.P.

23:47.320 --> 23:50.596
Yeah, you should see some of the stuff
we found in the post-party melee.

23:50.720 --> 23:53.473
We've got the fun job of figuring out
who all this stuff belongs to.

23:53.600 --> 23:55.830
Somebody's head
is very cold right now.

23:55.960 --> 23:59.396
- Look at this. What is this thing?

24:00.600 --> 24:02.397
Where did you find this?

24:02.520 --> 24:05.592
- By the habitat.
We gotta find those two guys.
- What two guys?

24:05.720 --> 24:08.837
What, that-- that one guy,
he was, what, Lithuanian.

24:08.960 --> 24:11.269
Yeah, Russian.
Eastern European.

24:11.400 --> 24:14.153
- Is everything okay?
- That thing's used by poachers!

24:20.760 --> 24:22.876
- Please, be careful.

24:23.000 --> 24:25.275
Always worrying, huh?

24:25.400 --> 24:27.868
Your mother was a worrier too.

24:28.000 --> 24:30.833
Always worrying
about the gorillas.

24:32.880 --> 24:35.553
It made her a lot of enemies.

24:35.680 --> 24:37.591
It led to tragedy.

24:38.680 --> 24:40.511
My mother was brave.

24:41.560 --> 24:43.391
So are you, my dear.

24:51.800 --> 24:54.633
What? It's not pretty.
I know.

24:55.760 --> 24:57.557
I'm sorry.

24:57.680 --> 24:59.477
How did it happen?

25:02.840 --> 25:05.513
Well, you could say
I had an encounter...

25:05.640 --> 25:07.437
with a monster.

25:08.520 --> 25:10.078
Monstrule.

25:12.120 --> 25:13.553
"Monstrule."

25:13.680 --> 25:15.875
Oh! That little demon...

25:16.000 --> 25:18.230
took off my thumb
and trigger finger!

25:18.360 --> 25:21.796
Monstrule! Monstrule!

25:37.800 --> 25:39.279
Come on, come on!

25:55.320 --> 25:57.629
Murderer! Aaah!

26:02.120 --> 26:03.838
- Jeez!

26:09.160 --> 26:11.435
Joe! Get out!

26:11.560 --> 26:13.391
Keep driving!

26:16.120 --> 26:18.475
Jill! Are you okay?

26:19.880 --> 26:22.553
What did I do? Those are
the guys who killed my mother.

26:22.680 --> 26:24.910
We gotta go!
Joe's in trouble!

26:26.280 --> 26:28.271
Whoa!

26:29.691 --> 26:33.047
Get out of the way!
Get out of the way!
Come on, let's go!

26:35.331 --> 26:37.083
Come on, move it!
Move it!

26:38.800 --> 26:39.800
- Ohh!
- Ohh!

26:50.251 --> 26:52.481
- Whoa! Look!
- Can you see it?

26:55.091 --> 26:57.889
What? Come on.
Nobody's seen an accident? What?

27:12.931 --> 27:15.764
- Oh, my God.

27:20.531 --> 27:22.328
Phat!

27:22.451 --> 27:24.885
Come on. Come on!

27:25.011 --> 27:28.242
- Will you just go!

27:50.771 --> 27:52.568
- Come on.
- Wait.

27:52.691 --> 27:54.602
The police will be here
any second.

27:54.731 --> 27:57.199
We have to get away from here.

28:01.251 --> 28:03.287
Ape! Oh, my God!

28:24.371 --> 28:26.726
Far out!

28:28.691 --> 28:30.329
- All right!

28:42.691 --> 28:44.886
- Turn it off!

28:57.931 --> 29:00.729
Go, Lisa, go!
Hurry!

29:00.851 --> 29:02.250
- Aaah!

29:07.371 --> 29:10.124
- Oh... my God.

29:10.251 --> 29:13.129
- Oh, my God. Shut up!

29:13.251 --> 29:15.890
- What are you laughing at?
- That was so cool!

29:16.011 --> 29:17.808
- Cool?
- He almost squashed us!

29:17.931 --> 29:20.570
That was not funny at all!

29:41.411 --> 29:43.242
- Yeah!
- Go, Joe! Yeah!

29:58.611 --> 30:01.683
- All right!
- Go, Joe!

30:13.731 --> 30:15.767
Oh, no.

30:15.891 --> 30:17.688
He's not here.

30:17.811 --> 30:19.722
- Couldn't have gotten far.
- Come on, girls.

30:19.851 --> 30:23.127
- Come on. This way.
- Let's go.

30:26.731 --> 30:29.882
Copy that.
Our orders are shoot to kill.
He's extremely dangerous.

30:30.011 --> 30:32.844
Shoot to kill? He's not dangerous.
You're dangerous!

30:32.971 --> 30:34.768
It's okay, Officer.
She didn't mean it.

30:34.891 --> 30:37.928
-I meant it! They're going to shoot him.
-Not if we find him first.

30:38.051 --> 30:39.882
- What's that?

30:42.051 --> 30:43.848
That's it.
We'll follow that helicopter.

30:43.971 --> 30:45.689
- What?
- Come on!

31:11.971 --> 31:15.281
I'm already 20 minutes late.
Who's gonna pay for this?

31:17.091 --> 31:20.561
What are you doing?
We can't go after the gorilla now.

31:21.691 --> 31:23.363
We need a car.

31:23.491 --> 31:25.607
What is your supervisor's name?

31:25.731 --> 31:28.848
- Would you please
step out of the vehicle.
- What's the problem?

31:29.891 --> 31:32.849
Fifth time this year.
Hey. Hey!

31:32.971 --> 31:34.768
Hey, I'm goin'!
I'm goin'!

31:34.891 --> 31:37.644
-You don't have to be so pushy about it!

31:37.771 --> 31:40.331
Hello?
County Animal Control?

31:40.451 --> 31:43.204
- You're not gonna believe this.
- Honey, look at the birdbath.

31:43.331 --> 31:45.561
Yes! Yes, it was
a gorilla, a big one!

31:45.691 --> 31:47.488
- Did you guys see it?

31:47.611 --> 31:50.967
Andy, come on, sweetheart.
No, no. It's a gorilla, honey.

32:19.011 --> 32:22.287
SWAT One, SWAT One, this is Police 2-4.
We've found him.

32:44.611 --> 32:47.842
Yeah, Police 2-4,
SWAT One's on the scene.

32:49.491 --> 32:52.324
He's goin' in the brush.
Don't lose him.

33:27.311 --> 33:29.267
Where'd he go?

33:32.351 --> 33:35.184
- He must have gone under that overpass.
- Well, cut him off.

33:40.351 --> 33:42.228
Bring 'er down.

33:55.551 --> 33:57.428
Must've gone up
that access ramp.

33:58.671 --> 34:00.866
Let's go find 'im.
Let's go.

34:41.071 --> 34:43.266
Where's he headed?

34:44.591 --> 34:47.059
Look.
He thinks it's my flashlight.

34:47.190 --> 34:50.945
He's going towards the light.
He thinks I'm calling him. That's it!

35:19.551 --> 35:22.270
- Daddy!
- Hi, Mommy!

35:22.391 --> 35:26.145
- Mom, I don't think you
should go on this ride.
- Why?

35:26.271 --> 35:29.581
- Because you threw up last time.
- What if I promise
to throw up over the side?

35:29.711 --> 35:31.508
I should go on this by myself.

35:31.631 --> 35:34.384
Okay. I'll get us
some cotton candy.

35:34.511 --> 35:36.945
- Okay.
- And no rocking, Jason!

35:37.071 --> 35:39.187
- Okay.
- Have a good time.

35:42.831 --> 35:45.584
All you gotta do is
hit the pig on the bottom!

35:45.711 --> 35:48.020
That's all you gotta do!

36:15.031 --> 36:18.546
Oh, my-- Honey, come on.
Come on with Mommy. Give Mommy a break.

36:18.671 --> 36:20.866
- No, Mommy, let's stay!
- No, honey!

36:20.991 --> 36:23.221
Please!

36:49.551 --> 36:51.269
Come on, let's stop it!

36:51.391 --> 36:54.110
Come on, kids, outta there.
There's a wild animal loose.

36:54.231 --> 36:56.028
- Find your parents. Go! Go!
- Whoa!

36:56.151 --> 36:59.268
- See that thing?

37:00.671 --> 37:02.468
Yow!

37:05.071 --> 37:07.665
- Holy--

37:19.871 --> 37:21.429
Come on.

37:24.671 --> 37:26.468
There she is.

37:26.591 --> 37:28.821
Just what exactly
are you aiming at?

37:31.151 --> 37:33.665
No! You can't do that.

37:33.791 --> 37:36.783
If that girl starts telling people
who we really are,

37:36.911 --> 37:40.381
our whole cover operation
will be blown.

37:40.511 --> 37:42.308
She's not an animal.

37:42.431 --> 37:44.706
- She's a human being.
- Joe!

37:46.551 --> 37:48.303
Let's go this way.

37:55.151 --> 37:57.346
That was very stupid, Garth.

37:57.471 --> 37:59.905
- What was that?
- I don't know. Come on.

38:01.151 --> 38:03.984
Fire!

38:04.111 --> 38:05.783
Fire!

38:05.911 --> 38:08.186
- Go on! Find Joe!
- Joe!

38:14.651 --> 38:18.803
The fire's spreading fast.
Keep this wheel moving.
We'll get 'em out on the run.

38:18.931 --> 38:21.764
Come on, you guys.
All right. That's it.

38:23.971 --> 38:26.166
Okay, come on.

38:26.291 --> 38:28.122
Oh, my God.

38:30.011 --> 38:32.366
Keep running! Hurry!

38:32.491 --> 38:34.482
Move it!

38:42.971 --> 38:44.484
Mommy!

38:48.611 --> 38:51.523
Okay, we got everybody off! Thanks!

39:02.491 --> 39:04.288
It's an ape!

39:04.411 --> 39:06.208
Jason!

39:07.691 --> 39:09.170
Jason!

39:42.091 --> 39:44.844
Joe!

39:49.131 --> 39:50.928
Goodbye, Jill.

39:51.051 --> 39:54.123
Meet your mother...
in hell.

39:55.211 --> 39:56.849
Goodbye.

40:19.331 --> 40:21.799
Bring the marksmen
up here now!

40:56.131 --> 40:58.725
- We need paramedics. Over.

40:58.851 --> 41:00.409
Jill!

41:00.531 --> 41:03.603
Strasser was here. Joe just killed him.
We gotta get out of here now.

41:03.731 --> 41:05.608
It's too late.

41:05.731 --> 41:08.165
No. We gotta stop 'em.
Come on!

41:08.291 --> 41:11.761
- Mom! Mom!

41:11.891 --> 41:15.042
- Evacuate the area! Get out of the way!
- Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

41:15.171 --> 41:17.002
- He's not dangerous!
- Get out of here!

41:20.331 --> 41:21.969
Mom!

41:24.771 --> 41:27.046
Mommy, help me.

41:47.371 --> 41:49.282
Joe?

41:52.371 --> 41:54.805
- Joe!
- Fire upon my command!

41:58.731 --> 42:00.847
Ready!

42:00.971 --> 42:03.531
Officer, I can't find my son,

42:03.651 --> 42:07.041
and I never saw him
get off the Ferris wheel.

42:07.171 --> 42:08.809
Look!

42:08.931 --> 42:10.762
Oh, my God!

42:12.291 --> 42:14.759
- Jason!
- Mommy.

42:14.891 --> 42:16.961
Mommy!

42:24.811 --> 42:28.247
He's gonna try and save him.
Don't shoot!

42:35.491 --> 42:37.800
Hold your fire!

42:52.451 --> 42:54.726
Come on, Joe.

42:54.851 --> 42:57.843
- Get the trucks in place.

43:09.091 --> 43:11.366
Help, please!

43:12.451 --> 43:13.850
He's gonna be okay.

43:18.131 --> 43:20.725
- Mom.
- Hang on.

43:36.131 --> 43:38.645
- He's got him.

43:39.971 --> 43:42.963
- Oh, no! Jason!

43:51.491 --> 43:53.959
Come on, Joe.

43:56.091 --> 43:59.049
Oh, my God, it's gonna tip!
It's gonna tilt!

43:59.171 --> 44:01.002
- Everybody get back! Run!
- Joe!

44:01.131 --> 44:04.009
- No! No!
- Joe!

44:44.451 --> 44:46.919
Oh, please!
Oh, baby!

44:48.251 --> 44:49.923
- Joe!
- Easy does it.

44:50.051 --> 44:51.848
Open your eyes.
Come on, big guy.

44:51.971 --> 44:54.610
- Come on. Oh, yeah, honey.
- Mommy!

44:54.731 --> 44:57.006
- Ohh. I'm here.
- Come on, big guy.

44:57.131 --> 45:00.601
- Open your eyes.
- Oh, I'm so sorry.

45:00.731 --> 45:02.687
Come on, Joe!

45:02.811 --> 45:07.009
Joe?
No. No. No.

45:07.131 --> 45:10.726
- Mommy, is he gonna be okay?
- I don't know, honey.

45:10.851 --> 45:13.081
No. No!

45:13.211 --> 45:14.883
Joe!

45:17.211 --> 45:19.327
Keep these people back!

45:19.451 --> 45:22.409
- Back it up!

45:22.531 --> 45:24.362
No.

45:25.771 --> 45:27.568
No!

45:34.651 --> 45:37.609
Don't leave me, big guy.

46:30.211 --> 46:32.486
Joe?

46:37.051 --> 46:39.804
- Joe?

46:39.931 --> 46:42.684
- He's alive!
- He's alive?

46:42.811 --> 46:44.802
- Joe!
- He's alive!

46:48.011 --> 46:50.047
- Joe.
- He's alive!

46:50.171 --> 46:54.084
You big palooka.
That's no way to ride a Ferris wheel.

46:54.211 --> 46:56.122
Joe!
Big guy, you scared me.

46:56.251 --> 46:59.721
We gotta get him outta here,
get him somewhere safe.

47:01.611 --> 47:03.408
Somewhere safe?

47:05.451 --> 47:08.204
Somewhere safe means
a new home for Joe.

47:08.331 --> 47:11.084
Where are we gonna get
that kind of money?

47:11.211 --> 47:13.805
I've got some money for Joe.

47:25.451 --> 47:28.284
Here. For Joe.

47:28.411 --> 47:31.483
- Folks, let's help him out.
- Thank you.

47:31.611 --> 47:34.364
Thank you.

47:34.491 --> 47:36.641
Thank you.

47:41.171 --> 47:42.968
Dear Cecily,

47:43.091 --> 47:47.369
I promised to write you when Joe
was settled, and now I finally can.

47:47.491 --> 47:50.244
With all the contributions
people sent in for Joe,

47:50.371 --> 47:54.887
we were able to buy a beautiful land
preserve that's even big enough for him.

47:57.411 --> 48:00.209
Tome fahura!

48:00.331 --> 48:03.801
We dedicated
the Joe Young Wildlife Park today,

48:03.931 --> 48:07.162
and it was one of
the happiest days of my life.

48:11.771 --> 48:13.568
At last...

48:13.691 --> 48:16.285
I have kept my promise
to my mother.

48:19.131 --> 48:22.680
The people here are saying N'Gai Zamu
the sacred guardian...

48:22.811 --> 48:25.484
- has returned to protect the mountains.

48:25.611 --> 48:29.968
Other people still say
N'Gai Zamu is just a legend.

48:30.091 --> 48:33.288
I say legends live forever.
