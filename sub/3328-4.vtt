00:01.730 --> 00:04.221
(grunting)

00:09.670 --> 00:12.434
(breathing hard)

00:12.480 --> 00:14.129
HOLMES:
So did you learn
anything, Watson?

00:14.180 --> 00:15.135
WATSON :
Yeah.

00:15.180 --> 00:16.545
That you
fight dirty.

00:16.580 --> 00:18.468
I fight
without mercy.

00:18.510 --> 00:19.670
A habit you
should develop

00:19.720 --> 00:21.142
if you hope
to defend yourself

00:21.180 --> 00:22.681
against bigger,
stronger opponents.

00:22.720 --> 00:25.416
Which may occur,
unless we limit ourselves

00:25.450 --> 00:27.680
to investigating crimes
committed by small children

00:27.720 --> 00:29.688
or large house cats.

00:29.730 --> 00:32.255
(phone ringing)

00:37.200 --> 00:38.758
Hello, Mistress.

00:40.540 --> 00:41.734
What?

00:43.770 --> 00:45.431
Hang up and
dial 911.

00:45.470 --> 00:47.176
Ask that Captain
Thomas Gregson

00:48.410 --> 00:50.207
I'll be there
shortly.

00:50.250 --> 00:51.478
Yes.

00:51.510 --> 00:53.740
Okay.
Hurry along, Watson.

00:53.780 --> 00:55.771
Dead body awaits.

00:57.220 --> 00:59.188
Call came in
around 10:30.

00:59.220 --> 01:01.188
New client looking
for light CP

01:01.220 --> 01:03.222
and a little OTK.
Excuse me?

01:03.260 --> 01:04.818
CP, corporal punishment.

01:04.860 --> 01:07.226
OTK, over-the-knee spanking.

01:07.260 --> 01:08.852
MISTRESS:
He said the door
would be unlocked.

01:08.900 --> 01:10.765
I walked in,
and there he was.

01:10.800 --> 01:12.688
Uh, he was like this
when you got here?

01:12.740 --> 01:14.367
He had on the mask.

01:14.400 --> 01:16.504
I gave him a few commands;
he didn't respond.

01:16.540 --> 01:17.837
At first,
I thought he was stubborn.

01:17.870 --> 01:19.406
Some slaves
are like that.

01:19.440 --> 01:20.600
Then I whacked him

01:20.640 --> 01:22.403
with this.
Still nothing.

01:22.450 --> 01:24.600
I took off the mask
and saw that he...

01:24.650 --> 01:25.844
he was dead.

01:25.880 --> 01:28.747
And that's when
you called Holmes.

01:28.780 --> 01:31.647
And you two know
each other how?

01:31.690 --> 01:33.317
Mistress Felicia
and I got chatting

01:33.360 --> 01:34.509
over an exhibition

01:34.560 --> 01:36.380
of torture devices
throughout history.

01:36.430 --> 01:37.727
Realized we had
a few friends
In common.

01:39.560 --> 01:41.255
We stayed in touch.

01:41.300 --> 01:44.895
Okay. Our, uh, victim's
name is Titus Delancey.

01:44.930 --> 01:46.363
Apparently,
he lives here,

01:46.400 --> 01:48.334
and according to this,
he's the CEO

01:48.370 --> 01:50.907
of APMG Financial
Consulting.

01:50.940 --> 01:52.601
That'll pay for a few spankings.

01:52.640 --> 01:56.349
Ms., uh, Felicia,
this is Detective Bell.

01:56.380 --> 01:58.598
He'll be taking
your statement.

02:00.480 --> 02:02.744
Beyond
Mistress Felicia's

02:02.790 --> 02:04.542
impending arrival
causing this guy

02:04.590 --> 02:07.354
to get so excited
that he had
a heart attack,

02:07.390 --> 02:08.880
I don't think
she killed him.

02:08.920 --> 02:11.627
Statistically speaking,
it would fit.

02:11.660 --> 02:12.922
Cardiac arrest,
most common cause of death

02:12.960 --> 02:15.394
for men over 50.

02:15.430 --> 02:17.660
Hmm.

02:17.700 --> 02:18.826
There's no talcum powder.

02:18.870 --> 02:20.633
Excuse me?

02:20.670 --> 02:21.898
Putting on a latex
garment like this

02:21.940 --> 02:23.498
_ is a bit like _
putting on a SWImSUIt

02:23.540 --> 02:26.270
that's two sizes too small
and already wet.

02:26.310 --> 02:29.575
Talcum powder is
generally de rigueur.

02:29.610 --> 02:31.407
While a man of
Mr. Delancey's girth

02:31.450 --> 02:33.270
would not have been able
to put on this sunt

02:33.320 --> 02:34.673
without an assist.

02:34.720 --> 02:36.711
So you're saying someone
helped him into it.

02:37.990 --> 02:39.855
Note the blue line

02:39.890 --> 02:41.585
around his lips.

02:44.990 --> 02:46.321
Oh...

02:46.360 --> 02:48.828
It's methemoglobinemia.

02:48.860 --> 02:51.328
His blood cells
stopped holding oxygen.

02:51.370 --> 02:53.964
It's usually a sign of

02:54.000 --> 02:55.865
nitroglycerin overdose.

02:55.900 --> 02:57.663
Nitroglycerin is prescribed
for heart problems.

02:57.710 --> 03:00.702
If he was on it,
he may have overmedicated.

03:00.740 --> 03:02.799
Well, if he's got meds,
they're probably upstairs.

03:02.850 --> 03:04.272
Prescription or not,

03:04.310 --> 03:07.211
accidentaloverdose
is unlikely.

03:07.250 --> 03:08.615
A lethal dose for
a man of his Size

03:08.650 --> 03:10.288
would be, what,
eight to ten tablets?

03:10.320 --> 03:11.912
That's a lot_ to consume
by mistake.

03:13.320 --> 03:14.514
(sniffs)

03:14.560 --> 03:15.709
Bourbon.

03:15.760 --> 03:17.387
Perfect vehicle
for masking

03:17.430 --> 03:19.227
nitroglycerin's odor.

03:20.730 --> 03:21.697
GREGSON:
Hey.

03:21.730 --> 03:22.822
That could be evidence.

03:22.870 --> 03:24.826
Yes, yes,
yes, yes.

03:24.870 --> 03:26.690
I've left
plenty of liquid

03:26.740 --> 03:27.934
for the lab
to analyze.

03:29.310 --> 03:30.959
I'm quite confident
they will confirm

03:31.010 --> 03:33.331
my findings.
What findings?

03:34.910 --> 03:36.901
Fire in the hole.

03:38.480 --> 03:41.244
Nitroglycerin, definitely.

03:41.280 --> 03:42.611
That man was poisoned.

03:49.060 --> 03:50.459
(whip cracks)

03:54.830 --> 03:56.388
WATSON: _'Cause when
your night ends

03:56.430 --> 03:57.397
with a dead guy
in a gimp suit,

03:57.430 --> 03:58.624
why not start
your morning

03:58.670 --> 04:00.433
with a live one
holding a bullwhip?

04:00.470 --> 04:02.961
A thank-you gift from Mistress
Felicia for assisting her.

04:05.710 --> 04:07.405
When I wasn't _
practicmg this morning,

04:07.440 --> 04:09.340
I was pushing forward
with our case.

04:09.380 --> 04:11.473
Detective Bell has spoken
with Titus Delancey's wife.

04:11.510 --> 04:13.341
She and her two sons
are preparing

04:14.850 --> 04:16.408
the family's vacation
home in Bedford.

04:16.450 --> 04:18.839
She swears that to the
best of her knowledge,

04:18.890 --> 04:21.609
her husband was
not into S&M.

04:21.660 --> 04:22.888
Uh... may I?

04:22.930 --> 04:24.557
Yes. Please.

04:24.590 --> 04:25.750
She's probably
telling the truth.

04:25.790 --> 04:27.451
I mean, we were
all over that house

04:27.500 --> 04:28.626
and there were
no other Signs

04:28.660 --> 04:29.866
of bondage gear
anywhere.

04:29.900 --> 04:31.492
Which leads me
to believe

04:31.530 --> 04:32.690
that the suit which
Mr. Delancey was found in

04:32.740 --> 04:35.300
was brought there
by the poisoner.

04:35.340 --> 04:36.898
And, most likely,
recently purchased,

04:36.940 --> 04:38.760
given the shininess
of the latex.

04:38.810 --> 04:40.038
So you think

04:40.080 --> 04:42.742
that after the killer
poisoned Titus Delancey,

04:42.780 --> 04:45.749
he shoved him into
a brand-new latex suit

04:45.780 --> 04:47.042
and left him to be found
by a dominatrix?

04:47.080 --> 04:49.787
He didn't just want
Delancey dead,

04:49.820 --> 04:51.310
he wanted him humiliated.

04:51.350 --> 04:52.658
A distinct possibility.

04:52.690 --> 04:54.885
And _answers are
Within our grasp.

04:54.920 --> 04:56.785
I have learned that
that particular brand of suit

04:56.830 --> 04:59.799
is only sold in two sex shops
in Manhattan.

04:59.830 --> 05:01.024
Happily for us,

05:01.060 --> 05:03.392
though sadly for
submissives of size,

05:03.430 --> 05:05.398
one_of those stores carries
nothing bigger than a large,

05:05.430 --> 05:07.739
which means
our victim's XXL suit

05:07.770 --> 05:09.601
was purchased at an
establishment called

05:09.640 --> 05:11.403
The Pleasure Parlor.

05:11.440 --> 05:13.829
Mm. I guess I know where we'll
be heading this morning.

05:15.710 --> 05:17.405
Excuse me.

05:17.450 --> 05:19.543
Detective Bell,
NYPD.

05:19.580 --> 05:20.717
My colleagues and I
are investigating

05:20.750 --> 05:22.069
the murder of a man

05:22.120 --> 05:24.418
found in a black latex
body suit, size double-XL.

05:24.450 --> 05:25.587
We believe it was
purchased here.

05:25.620 --> 05:27.087
We were hoping
you could give us

05:27.120 --> 05:28.883
the names of customers who
bought one in the past month.

05:28.920 --> 05:30.820
Sure.
Happy to help.

05:30.860 --> 05:32.828
Just as soon as you come
back with a subpoena.

05:32.860 --> 05:34.452
You heard the part
about this being

05:34.500 --> 05:35.990
a murder investigation,
right?

05:36.030 --> 05:37.463
You job is
to solve crimes.

05:37.500 --> 05:39.491
Mine is to protect
my customers' privacy

05:39.540 --> 05:40.768
from a police force

05:40.800 --> 05:43.132
eager to demonize
the sexually adventurous.

05:43.170 --> 05:44.967
No, I suppose we shouldn't be
surprised to find you

05:45.010 --> 05:46.830
on a moral high horse.
You are wearing chaps.

05:46.880 --> 05:47.972
WATSON:
Excuse me.

05:48.010 --> 05:49.477
Is this your only
rack of latex suits?

05:49.510 --> 05:50.647
Yes.

05:50.680 --> 05:52.102
Oh. We gotta figure

05:52.150 --> 05:53.708
that the killer touched
all of these

05:53.750 --> 05:55.445
to find the right size,
so since we can't

05:55.480 --> 05:57.448
get his name, we can at least
get his fingerprints.

05:57.490 --> 05:58.843
We should just take the whole
rack down to the station,

05:58.890 --> 06:00.016
dust for prints.

06:00.060 --> 06:01.652
Excellent plan.

06:01.690 --> 06:03.055
That's thousands
of dollars of merchandise.

06:03.090 --> 06:04.728
You know you need
a subpoena

06:04.760 --> 06:06.899
for those,
too, right?
I do.

06:06.930 --> 06:08.090
You guys call
the captain.

06:08.130 --> 06:10.690
I'll wait here
for the subpoena,

06:10.730 --> 06:12.061
wearing my badge,

06:12.100 --> 06:13.499
greeting customers.

06:15.500 --> 06:17.036
(door opens,
bell on door jingles)

06:18.440 --> 06:20.169
(door closes, bell jingles)

06:20.210 --> 06:22.007
The only extra,
extra large sale

06:22.040 --> 06:24.543
this month was
last night.

06:24.580 --> 06:25.740
About 9:30.

06:25.780 --> 06:27.077
I was here.

06:27.120 --> 06:28.815
Guy definitely wasn't
shopping for himself.

06:28.850 --> 06:30.511
He was a medium
at most.

06:30.550 --> 06:31.881
Okay, we're gonna
need his name.

06:31.920 --> 06:32.887
I don't have it.

06:32.920 --> 06:34.114
He paid cash.

06:35.560 --> 06:38.984
But he got it
from that ATM.

06:42.060 --> 06:43.789
BELL:
In case you're unsure what

06:43.830 --> 06:45.627
you're looking at,
Mr. Jefferies, that's you,

06:45.670 --> 06:47.661
at 9:38 last night.

06:47.700 --> 06:48.860
And unless
your apartment

06:48.900 --> 06:50.606
looks just like
a sex shop,

06:50.640 --> 06:51.800
you were not,

06:51.840 --> 06:53.000
as you claimed
a few minutes ago,

06:53.040 --> 06:54.530
home watching TV.

06:54.580 --> 06:55.729
I went for
a walk.

06:55.780 --> 06:57.475
I forgot that I
stopped in there.

06:57.510 --> 07:00.445
Apparently, that's not
all you forgot.

07:00.480 --> 07:02.482
You bought a fetish suit

07:02.520 --> 07:04.909
and shoved your boss
into it.

07:04.950 --> 07:07.657
Probably right after
you poisoned him.

07:07.690 --> 07:10.181
No, I did not,
I did not... poison Titus.

07:10.230 --> 07:12.084
I already told you that.

07:12.130 --> 07:13.757
BELL:
Hey. You're in a lot of
trouble, Mr. Jefferies.

07:13.800 --> 07:16.564
We can't help you if
you don't level with us.

07:19.540 --> 07:20.666
Okay.

07:20.700 --> 07:22.190
I did buy the fetish suit.

07:22.240 --> 07:23.707
And I did put Titus in it.

07:25.140 --> 07:26.778
Titus and I were supposed
to have dinner last night.

07:26.810 --> 07:28.801
I arrived at his house
around 8:45.

07:28.840 --> 07:30.046
When he didn't
answer the door,

07:30.080 --> 07:31.047
I went around back.

07:31.080 --> 07:32.775
The patio door
was open,

07:32.820 --> 07:34.640
and I saw Titus
in the living room,
lying on the floor.

07:34.680 --> 07:36.682
I went in, and when I got there,
he was already dead.

07:36.720 --> 07:37.948
No pulse, no breathing.

07:37.990 --> 07:40.185
I just assumed he'd
had a heart attack.

07:40.220 --> 07:41.687
I swear to you,

07:41.720 --> 07:43.529
I didn't know
he had been poisoned

07:43.560 --> 07:44.982
until I heard about it
this morning on the news.

07:45.030 --> 07:49.126
You're head of acquisitions
at APMG, correct?

07:49.160 --> 07:52.220
So with Titus gone,

07:52.270 --> 07:54.966
I'm sure you're
in the running for CEO?

07:55.000 --> 07:56.228
Yes, I am.

07:56.270 --> 07:57.669
But I didn't need
for Titus to die

07:57.710 --> 07:58.836
in order for
that to happen.

07:58.870 --> 08:01.009
A few weeks ago,
when Titus announced

08:01.040 --> 08:03.008
that he was retiring
at the end of the year,

08:03.050 --> 08:04.938
I was already on
the short list to replace him.

08:04.980 --> 08:06.641
Then why put
the suit on him?

08:06.680 --> 08:08.511
Why call
the dominatrix?

08:10.150 --> 08:13.608
Okay, Titus's contract
guaranteed him

08:13.660 --> 08:16.959
a huge retirement payout.

08:16.990 --> 08:19.720
$125 million lump sum.
If he dies,

08:19.760 --> 08:21.728
that money goes
to his family.

08:21.760 --> 08:25.127
His contract also
contained a morals clause.

08:25.170 --> 08:26.865
So you dressed him up
in bondage gear,

08:26.900 --> 08:28.731
set him up
with a dominatrix,

08:28.770 --> 08:30.738
all so that
the company could save

08:30.770 --> 08:32.977
giving him a retirement bonus?

08:33.010 --> 08:36.605
That's $125 million extra

08:36.650 --> 08:38.606
in our coffers.

08:38.650 --> 08:39.810
The year-end bonuses

08:39.850 --> 08:41.841
would have
been huge.

08:41.880 --> 08:43.711
Guys, okay,
if the charge here

08:43.750 --> 08:45.809
is that I am
a greedy jerk

08:45.850 --> 08:48.159
with really
questionable judgment,

08:48.190 --> 08:49.623
then I'm guilty.

08:49.660 --> 08:51.628
But I swear to you,
I'm not a murderer.

08:51.660 --> 08:53.548
I just got off the phone
with the lab.

08:53.600 --> 08:54.794
They confirm the nitroglycerin

08:54.830 --> 08:56.024
in Titus Delancey's glass

08:56.060 --> 08:58.699
but said the bottle
of bourbon was clean.

08:58.730 --> 09:00.061
Which means w_hoever
p0isoned him

09:00.100 --> 09:01.738
was in the room
when he poured his drink.

09:01.770 --> 09:04.102
The security guard
at APMG

09:04.140 --> 09:06.301
puts Jefferies at the office
till about 8:00 p.m.,

09:06.340 --> 09:09.104
which according to the ME.
is when Delancey died.

09:09.140 --> 09:10.869
So Mr. Jefferies
used his boss's corpse

09:10.910 --> 09:12.241
as a dress-up doll

09:12.280 --> 09:14.168
but didn't kill him.

09:14.220 --> 09:15.710
Our poisoner is still at large.

09:15.750 --> 09:18.287
(phone beeps)

09:18.320 --> 09:20.754
I asked Delancey's wife
to let me know

09:20.790 --> 09:22.189
when she and the boys
got back to Riverdale.

09:22.220 --> 09:23.585
She says she'll be there in 20.

09:23.630 --> 09:26.087
GREGSON:
All right.

09:27.360 --> 09:30.124
I talked to Titus
yesterday afternoon.

09:30.170 --> 09:32.638
He-he didn't mention
any plans for the evening.

09:32.670 --> 09:34.934
And you and the boys
stayed overnight in Bedford.

09:34.970 --> 09:36.665
Yes.

09:36.710 --> 09:38.166
We have a house there.

09:38.210 --> 09:40.269
It was the nanny's night off.

09:40.310 --> 09:41.868
So the three of us

09:41.910 --> 09:43.775
just had a quiet evening
at home.

09:43.810 --> 09:45.607
Mrs. Delancey,

09:45.650 --> 09:47.015
can you think
ofanyone

09:47.050 --> 09:48.347
that might have wanted
to harm your husband?

09:48.380 --> 09:52.680
I can't think of anyone
specific.

09:52.720 --> 09:55.814
But Titus was
a very successful man.

09:55.860 --> 09:58.249
That's not easy to pull off
without making some enemies.

10:01.000 --> 10:02.888
Those poor boys.

10:02.930 --> 10:05.967
They've been through this
once already.

10:06.000 --> 10:08.036
Their mother died
of cancer five years ago.

10:08.070 --> 10:09.662
(door opens)
When did you

10:09.710 --> 10:10.699
and Mr. Delancey
get married?

10:10.740 --> 10:11.832
About three years ago.

10:11.870 --> 10:12.973
WOMAN:
Peri?

10:13.010 --> 10:14.034
Oh, God.
I got here

10:14.080 --> 10:15.035
as quickly as I could.

10:15.080 --> 10:16.331
I'm so sorry.

10:16.380 --> 10:18.109
How are the boys?

10:18.150 --> 10:19.378
Struggling.

10:19.410 --> 10:21.173
Zack, especially.

10:21.220 --> 10:23.643
This is
our nanny,

10:23.690 --> 10:25.089
Anne Barker.

10:25.120 --> 10:26.712
Uh, this is
Captain Gregson.

10:26.760 --> 10:28.250
He and his
colleagues

10:28.290 --> 10:29.826
are here investigating
what happened.

10:29.860 --> 10:31.088
Oh. Anne.

10:31.130 --> 10:32.051
Barker?
Yes.

10:32.090 --> 10:33.057
Yes.
Sherlock Holmes.

10:33.100 --> 10:34.351
Nice to
meet you.

10:34.400 --> 10:36.721
I'm gonna check
on the boys, okay?

10:36.770 --> 10:38.067
What's wrong?

10:38.100 --> 10:40.364
Uh, a moment
outside, please.

10:40.400 --> 10:42.061
Excuse us.

10:42.100 --> 10:44.637
(birds twittering)

10:50.010 --> 10:51.944
Do you remember
the Abigail Spencer case,

10:51.980 --> 10:53.140
in the early '905?

10:53.180 --> 10:54.818
15-year-old Michigan girl.

10:54.850 --> 10:56.681
She was accused of fatally
poisoning her father.

10:56.720 --> 10:58.813
Yeah.
It was all over the papers.

10:58.850 --> 10:59.817
Yeah.

10:59.860 --> 11:01.009
Well, that also involved

11:01.060 --> 11:02.755
a nitroglycerin overdose.

11:02.790 --> 11:04.326
I followed the trial
qUIte closely.

11:04.360 --> 11:05.884
I was fascinated by it.

11:05.930 --> 11:07.989
I was 15 years old myself
at the time.

11:09.200 --> 11:11.361
She was acquitted, right?

11:11.400 --> 11:13.789
Yep, many people continued

11:13.840 --> 11:16.809
to believe that she had,
indeed, killed her father.

11:16.840 --> 11:18.034
She was scrutinized
by the media,

11:18.070 --> 11:19.435
she was harassed, so one day,

11:19.470 --> 11:21.370
she just packed up her stuff,
disappeared.

11:21.410 --> 11:23.298
Presumably to start anew

11:23.350 --> 11:24.772
somewhere else.

11:24.810 --> 11:26.368
Never heard from again.

11:28.150 --> 11:30.186
The woman we just met,
the nanny.

11:30.220 --> 11:33.212
She was introduced
as Anne Barker,

11:33.260 --> 11:35.353
but I'm quite certain
that her real name

11:35.390 --> 11:37.278
is Abigail Spencer.

11:43.970 --> 11:45.824
Uh, for the record, your current
legal name is Anne Barker,

11:45.870 --> 11:49.260
but you were born
Abigail Spencer, correct?

11:49.300 --> 11:52.736
Yes, I was born Abigail Spencer.

11:52.780 --> 11:54.475
And back in 1991,

11:54.510 --> 11:57.070
you were accused of murdering
your father with nitroglycerine.

11:57.110 --> 11:58.372
Accused and acquitted.

11:58.410 --> 12:00.947
Lot of people thought
you got away with murder.

12:00.980 --> 12:02.208
Really? I had no idea.

12:02.250 --> 12:04.810
Certainly not why
I changed my name.

12:07.160 --> 12:10.129
Look, my dad was not a nice man,

12:10.160 --> 12:11.980
okay?

12:12.030 --> 12:13.827
He was cruel,
and he beat me.

12:13.860 --> 12:15.851
So when he died,
I didn't weep or wail

12:15.900 --> 12:17.891
or do any of those things

12:17.930 --> 12:20.160
teenage girls apparently do
when their dad dies.

12:20.200 --> 12:22.862
So everyone assumed
that I killed him.

12:22.910 --> 12:25.265
Let's talk about Titus Delancey.

12:25.310 --> 12:27.403
Okay.
Are you aware he was poisoned?

12:27.440 --> 12:28.976
Yes, and to answer
your next question,

12:29.010 --> 12:30.204
no, I didn't kill him.

12:30.250 --> 12:31.945
Then why are you
sounding so defensive?

12:31.980 --> 12:33.914
Because I'm being interrogated
by the police.

12:33.950 --> 12:36.168
So I feel like being defensive
is sort of a natural reaction.

12:36.220 --> 12:38.347
You don't find it
the least bit coincidental

12:38.390 --> 12:41.780
that he was killed
with the exact poison

12:41.820 --> 12:43.959
that killed your father?

12:43.990 --> 12:45.321
No, I find it
extremely coincidental,

12:45.360 --> 12:46.952
but I didn't do it.

12:47.000 --> 12:48.353
Any idea who did?

12:48.400 --> 12:50.220
I have no idea, okay?

12:50.270 --> 12:51.794
I'm the nanny.

12:51.830 --> 12:53.331
He and I weren't close.

12:53.370 --> 12:55.065
We didn't spend a lot
of time together.

12:55.100 --> 12:57.364
Where were you last night?

12:57.410 --> 12:58.832
(sighs)

12:58.870 --> 13:00.337
Home alone.

13:00.380 --> 13:02.371
That's a lousy alibi, Abigail.

13:02.410 --> 13:03.843
Yeah, well, if I knew
I needed one,

13:03.880 --> 13:05.973
I would've
invited somebody over.

13:06.010 --> 13:08.149
I keep to myself.

13:08.180 --> 13:10.080
I have ever since
the trial.

13:10.120 --> 13:12.987
Lost every friend you ever had,
didn't you?

13:13.020 --> 13:16.478
The ones who thought
I was guilty were afraid of me.

13:16.520 --> 13:19.250
And the ones who
knew I was innocent

13:19.290 --> 13:20.826
couldn't be around me

13:20.860 --> 13:23.397
without being in every paper
in the country.

13:23.430 --> 13:25.569
The media ruined my life,

13:25.600 --> 13:28.433
and now it's about to happen
all over again,

13:28.470 --> 13:30.131
thanks to you.

13:30.170 --> 13:32.229
After I ran away,

13:32.270 --> 13:33.305
I got plastic surgery.

13:33.340 --> 13:34.409
No one has recognized me

13:34.440 --> 13:36.101
in 19 years.

13:36.140 --> 13:38.005
How did you do it?

13:38.050 --> 13:39.847
Your voice.

13:39.880 --> 13:42.314
I just recognized it
from the media coverage.

13:42.350 --> 13:44.341
(sighs)

13:46.590 --> 13:48.114
Look,

13:48.160 --> 13:50.287
I know you can't prove

13:50.330 --> 13:53.128
that I had anything to do
with Mr. Delancey's death.

13:53.160 --> 13:55.299
If you could've, you would've
arrested me back at the house.

13:55.330 --> 13:58.163
So, if you don't have
any more questions,

13:58.200 --> 14:00.031
I would like to leave please.

14:00.070 --> 14:01.935
I've spent enough of my life

14:01.970 --> 14:04.063
being accused
of things I didn't do.

14:11.410 --> 14:13.571
Doesn't feel right,
letting her go.

14:13.620 --> 14:15.315
I mean, you talk
about a solid suspect.

14:15.350 --> 14:17.045
She was right; we don't
have enough evidence

14:17.090 --> 14:19.046
to hold her yet.

14:19.090 --> 14:21.650
I don't believe she did it.

14:21.690 --> 14:23.282
You're the one
who pointed her out.

14:23.330 --> 14:24.979
Her presence
at the Delancey home

14:25.030 --> 14:26.383
was too remarkable to ignore,

14:26.430 --> 14:28.455
but her haptics suggest
she's telling the truth.

14:28.500 --> 14:31.060
Titus Delancey was killed
with nitroglycerine.

14:31.100 --> 14:33.091
So was her dad;
that can't be a coincidence.

14:33.140 --> 14:34.596
I agree,

14:34.640 --> 14:37.006
but I think the similarities
are qUIte deliberate,

14:37.040 --> 14:38.928
and I think
whoever poisoned Mr. Delancey

14:38.970 --> 14:40.403
intends to frame Ms. Spencer.

14:40.440 --> 14:42.305
That would mean
the killer knew who she was.

14:42.340 --> 14:45.343
She said no one had
recognized her in 19 years.

14:45.380 --> 14:47.348
As far as she knows.

14:51.390 --> 14:53.153
So you want to
tell me how you knew

14:53.190 --> 14:54.612
about her tattoo?

14:54.660 --> 14:56.548
Beg your pardon?

14:56.590 --> 14:58.455
Abigail's tattoo.

14:58.490 --> 15:00.253
When you recognized
her today,

15:00.300 --> 15:02.097
you said it was
because of her voice,

15:02.130 --> 15:05.190
but I think it was
something more than that.

15:05.230 --> 15:07.460
You fixated on the tattoo
on her wrist.

15:07.500 --> 15:10.037
At first I thought
you remembered it

15:10.070 --> 15:12.971
from a picture that was taken
during her trial, but then,

15:13.010 --> 15:14.204
when I looked back at coverage,

15:14.240 --> 15:16.174
Abigail did not have a tattoo.

15:16.210 --> 15:17.700
So how could you
have recognized it?

15:17.750 --> 15:19.604
Impressive, Watson.

15:19.650 --> 15:21.242
Quite impressive.

15:21.280 --> 15:23.111
You know,

15:23.150 --> 15:25.084
the truth is
that Abigail Spencer and I

15:25.120 --> 15:26.985
are old acquaintances,

15:27.020 --> 15:29.079
after a fashion.

15:29.120 --> 15:31.623
By the time I was 15,

15:31.660 --> 15:34.220
I was fascinated by murder
and all things...

15:34.260 --> 15:35.488
criminal.

15:35.530 --> 15:37.191
Abigail was so beautiful,

15:37.230 --> 15:39.266
and her father's fortune so vast

15:39.300 --> 15:42.337
that the UK tabloids actually
deigned to cover the case.

15:42.370 --> 15:44.133
Over time, they lost interest.

15:44.170 --> 15:45.728
I did not.

15:45.770 --> 15:48.204
I became fascinated
by the question of her guilt.

15:48.240 --> 15:50.743
So I wrote to her.

15:50.780 --> 15:53.749
A letter comprised
of very direct questions

15:53.780 --> 15:57.147
about her life
and her father's death.

15:57.190 --> 15:58.418
Hmm.

15:58.450 --> 15:59.678
So she wrote back.

15:59.720 --> 16:02.484
Yeah, we corresponded
throughout the trial

16:02.520 --> 16:04.624
and for a while afterwards.

16:04.660 --> 16:06.423
In one of her later missives,

16:06.460 --> 16:08.428
she mentioned that she wanted
to get a tattoo

16:08.460 --> 16:10.325
of a phoenix on her wrist.

16:10.370 --> 16:12.326
A symbol of her rebirth

16:14.070 --> 16:16.163
Why didn't she recognize
your name today?

16:16.200 --> 16:18.703
I mean, Sherlock Holmes
is pretty hard to forget.

16:18.740 --> 16:20.230
In my teenage years,

16:20.280 --> 16:23.044
I was a lot less self-assured
than I am today.

16:23.080 --> 16:25.173
I yearned
for a more typical name.

16:25.210 --> 16:27.041
So for a while,
I attempted to be known

16:27.080 --> 16:28.741
as Sean Holmes.

16:28.780 --> 16:30.179
Didn't stick,

16:30.220 --> 16:32.188
but Sean
and Abigail's correspondence

16:32.220 --> 16:35.519
became a very real window
into the criminal mind.

16:35.560 --> 16:37.323
Are you saying
that she confessed

16:37.360 --> 16:38.725
to killing her father to you?

16:38.760 --> 16:41.194
She never
directly addressed the issue.

16:41.230 --> 16:44.119
Without knowing,
she revealed details,

16:44.170 --> 16:46.195
which I believe,
filled in the holes

16:46.230 --> 16:47.538
in the case against her.

16:47.570 --> 16:49.128
As for her relationship
with her father,

16:49.170 --> 16:52.139
well, she shared some things

16:52.170 --> 16:54.400
which must have been
quite humiliating for her.

16:54.440 --> 16:55.805
She left me in little doubt

16:55.840 --> 16:57.808
that he was, indeed,
physically abusive

16:57.850 --> 17:01.741
and that she was responsible
for his death.

17:01.780 --> 17:03.611
Wow.

17:03.650 --> 17:05.618
Sounds like
she really opened up to you.

17:05.650 --> 17:07.584
She was an excellent
research subject.

17:07.620 --> 17:09.383
She was very forthcoming,

17:09.420 --> 17:12.082
attributable primarily
to her isolation at the time,

17:12.130 --> 17:15.793
and my promise that
whatever she shared with me

17:15.830 --> 17:17.422
would be kept
in the strictest confidence.

17:17.470 --> 17:19.461
That doesn't sound
like you at all.

17:19.500 --> 17:21.434
I mean, not telling anyone

17:21.470 --> 17:23.267
that you'd figured out
that she was guilty?

17:23.310 --> 17:24.800
Trial was over.

17:24.840 --> 17:27.536
Double jeopardy protected her
from a second,

17:27.580 --> 17:30.105
and I was quite confident
that although she had killed,

17:30.150 --> 17:32.277
she was not a killer.

17:32.310 --> 17:34.210
She posed no threat
to anyone other than her father.

17:34.250 --> 17:36.775
Titus Delancey
might disagree.

17:36.820 --> 17:39.186
Well, as I told you, I don't
believe Abigail's responsible.

17:39.220 --> 17:41.780
You think she's being framed,
but how can you be so sure?

17:41.820 --> 17:44.584
You are relying on a judgment
you made when you were 15.

17:44.630 --> 17:46.120
Well, when I made it
is irrelevant.

17:46.160 --> 17:47.696
What matters is I was right.

17:47.730 --> 17:49.425
I believe

17:49.460 --> 17:51.428
that when I have identified
the person

17:51.470 --> 17:54.359
who has uncovered Abigail's
secret, we'll have our killer.

17:54.400 --> 17:56.436
(indistinct chatter)

17:56.470 --> 17:57.767
(doorbell rings)

17:57.810 --> 18:00.608
(gasps)

18:00.640 --> 18:02.471
I don't know who let you in,

18:02.510 --> 18:04.569
but you're not allowed
to be up here.

18:04.610 --> 18:06.271
My name is Sherlock Holmes.

18:06.310 --> 18:08.244
I work with the police.

18:08.280 --> 18:09.542
We met yesterday.

18:09.580 --> 18:11.116
Well, unless you have a warrant,

18:11.150 --> 18:12.640
I don't want to talk
to you, either.

18:12.690 --> 18:14.157
You used
to know me.

18:14.190 --> 18:16.249
By another name.

18:16.290 --> 18:18.383
Sean Holmes.

18:18.430 --> 18:20.455
(gasps)

18:20.500 --> 18:23.492
I don't understand.

18:23.530 --> 18:25.361
You could have told me
yesterday.

18:25.400 --> 18:28.494
Well, I confess to being
a little thrown when I saw you.

18:28.540 --> 18:30.735
Also, I didn't know how

18:30.770 --> 18:34.501
to explain our relationship
to my colleagues.

18:36.840 --> 18:38.603
I never thought
this would happen.

18:38.650 --> 18:40.208
(sighs)

18:40.250 --> 18:41.774
I never thought
I would meet you.

18:41.820 --> 18:43.685
(sighs)
I used

18:43.720 --> 18:45.915
to look forward to receiving
your letters so much.

18:45.950 --> 18:47.611
And I yours.

18:47.660 --> 18:50.788
Peri fired me.

18:50.830 --> 18:53.526
I didn't even get to say
good-bye to Graham or Zack.

18:53.560 --> 18:56.449
I'm sure you've seen my friends
who are outside the building.

18:57.970 --> 18:59.494
You could have pulled me aside
yesterday.

18:59.530 --> 19:01.168
You could have kept this
between us.

19:02.300 --> 19:04.905
I'm sorry... for any turmoil

19:04.940 --> 19:07.170
I have caused you.

19:07.210 --> 19:09.531
(sniffles)

19:09.580 --> 19:12.799
I supposed
I should apologize, too.

19:14.580 --> 19:17.219
I'm the one who stopped writing.

19:17.250 --> 19:19.616
I'm the one who disappeared
without saying good-bye.

19:19.650 --> 19:21.914
I understood.

19:21.960 --> 19:25.179
You needed
to leave Abigail behind.

19:25.230 --> 19:27.721
So the phoenix might rise.

19:31.700 --> 19:35.488
I came here today because
I-I don't believe

19:35.540 --> 19:37.508
that you killed
Titus Delancey.

19:37.540 --> 19:39.201
_ Nor do I think
it's a c0inCIdence

19:39.240 --> 19:40.639
that he was poisoned

19:40.680 --> 19:42.739
with the same agent
used to kill your father.

19:42.780 --> 19:44.407
_ Ithi_nk someone
is taking advantage

19:44.450 --> 19:47.510
of your proximity to the man
to get away with murder.

19:47.550 --> 19:49.472
You think
someone's setting me up?

19:49.520 --> 19:51.511
Has anyone
you know asked

19:51.550 --> 19:52.881
any prying questions,

19:52.920 --> 19:54.956
taken an excessive interest
in your past?

19:54.990 --> 19:55.957
No one.

19:55.990 --> 19:58.379
Something? Anything?

19:58.430 --> 20:00.227
(sighs)

20:00.260 --> 20:02.854
Last month,
I was running errands for Peri,

20:02.900 --> 20:05.494
and I kept seeing
the same brown sedan

20:05.530 --> 20:06.861
in the review
mi_rror.
Followmg you?

20:06.900 --> 20:09.539
I don't know.
I-I took down...

20:09.570 --> 20:12.403
the license plate number
in my phone

20:12.440 --> 20:15.603
just in case
it ever happened again, but...

20:15.640 --> 20:17.949
it never did.

20:22.420 --> 20:24.741
(keypad keys clicking)

20:29.790 --> 20:32.350
I should pass this along
to my colleagues.

20:36.600 --> 20:38.864
That's it?

20:38.900 --> 20:41.892
You show up after all these
years, and then you just leave?

20:41.940 --> 20:43.567
This might be important.

20:43.610 --> 20:46.306
I don't have anyone
I can talk to.

20:46.340 --> 20:49.332
I can't leave
my apartment

20:49.380 --> 20:52.372
without the press
eating me alive.

20:52.410 --> 20:54.913
The letters that you used
to write me

20:54.950 --> 20:57.418
got me through times like these,
and now you're here...

20:57.450 --> 20:59.611
in person.

21:01.960 --> 21:04.485
(quietly):
I'm afraid.

21:05.960 --> 21:09.293
And I could really use
a friend right now.

21:12.370 --> 21:13.496
:::,?:;::§ :2

21:13.540 --> 21:15.428
So, we got a hit
on that license plate

21:15.470 --> 21:17.358
Holmes gave us.
Abigail was being tailed

21:17.410 --> 21:19.366
by a private investigator
out of Trenton.

21:19.410 --> 21:20.707
We just talked to the guy.

21:20.740 --> 21:22.628
Turns out he was hired
by none other

21:22.680 --> 21:24.898
than Peri Delancey,
our victim's wife.

21:24.950 --> 21:27.839
GREGSON:
And according to the
PI, Peri was hoping

21:27.880 --> 21:29.438
Titus was _
haVIng an affair.

21:29.480 --> 21:30.913
It seems that in her prenup,

21:30.950 --> 21:33.453
she was limited
to a very small amount

21:33.490 --> 21:34.912
in the_ event
of a divorce,

21:34.960 --> 21:36.587
unless she caught
him cheating.

21:36.620 --> 21:38.383
So, she has the
PI check out

21:38.430 --> 21:39.988
all the women in
her husband's life.

21:40.030 --> 21:41.395
Including Abigail.

21:41.430 --> 21:42.727
Yeah, and the thing is,

21:42.760 --> 21:44.068
Titus wasn't sleeping
with anyone,

21:44.100 --> 21:46.318
which put a damper
on Peri's divorce plans,

21:46.370 --> 21:47.689
but, in the process,

21:47.740 --> 21:49.731
the PI uncovered
Abigail's true identity.

21:49.770 --> 21:50.964
Investigator turned over

21:51.010 --> 21:53.069
his report a full
two weeks ago.

21:53.110 --> 21:56.079
She doesn't tell anyone,
she doesn't fire Abigail.

21:56.110 --> 21:58.578
She just keeps letting
a suspected poisoner

21:58.610 --> 22:00.419
make sandwiches
for her stepkids.

22:00.450 --> 22:02.077
BELL:
Peri told us she was

22:02.120 --> 22:04.338
at the Bedford house
with the boys the other night,

22:04.390 --> 22:05.789
but once we spoke to them
on their own,

22:05.820 --> 22:07.515
they said they were
watching TV in their rooms.

22:07.560 --> 22:09.482
It wouldn't have been hard
for her to sneak out,

22:09.520 --> 22:11.488
poison Titus, and make it back
before anyone noticed.

22:11.530 --> 22:14.021
So it looks like
Sherlock was right;

22:14.060 --> 22:16.824
Abigail was being framed.

22:16.860 --> 22:19.567
My client is ready
to make a statement.

22:21.570 --> 22:24.664
The night Titus died,
I met Dr. Phillip Malone

22:24.710 --> 22:27.634
at the Campbell Bar
in Mount Kisco as 7:00 pm.

22:27.680 --> 22:28.806
Several members

22:28.840 --> 22:30.808
of the staff can conﬁrm
that I was there

22:30.850 --> 22:32.909
most of the evening.
You and Dr. Malone

22:32.950 --> 22:35.373
having an affair?
Because if that's
the case, you didn't

22:35.420 --> 22:36.773
need to bring
a lawyer with you.

22:36.820 --> 22:38.048
That's not it.

22:38.090 --> 22:39.648
As you would
eventually discover,

22:39.690 --> 22:41.112
Dr. Malone has a prior arrest

22:41.160 --> 22:43.788
for illegal distribution
of prescription meds.

22:43.830 --> 22:47.527
My client is happy
to testify against Dr. Malone

22:47.560 --> 22:49.528
if you'll agree not to bring
charges against her

22:49.560 --> 22:50.720
in the death of her husband.

22:50.770 --> 22:52.795
Well, if your client
has a solid alibi,

22:52.830 --> 22:54.536
what would we
charge her with?

22:54.570 --> 22:57.937
We'd like to avoid
an attempted murder charge.

22:57.970 --> 23:01.474
Mrs. Delancey, what medication

23:01.510 --> 23:03.808
did you purchase
from Dr. Malone?

23:03.850 --> 23:06.569
Nitroglycerin.

23:06.610 --> 23:08.976
Which you were planning
to use to kill your husband.

23:09.020 --> 23:13.684
I was... considering it.

23:13.720 --> 23:17.759
I figured if I went through
with it, I could call in

23:17.790 --> 23:20.588
an anonymous tip,
tell the police about
who Anne really was,

23:20.630 --> 23:21.949
and she'd get the blame.

23:22.000 --> 23:23.695
But to be clear...

23:23.730 --> 23:26.824
it was just something
I thought about.

23:26.870 --> 23:31.000
I don't think I ever could
have actually hurt Titus.

23:31.040 --> 23:32.860
So your client's
statement is

23:32.910 --> 23:34.673
that she couldn't
have killed her husband

23:34.710 --> 23:37.907
because she was too busy
planning to kill her husband?

23:47.990 --> 23:49.514
First time in my career

23:49.560 --> 23:51.187
someone's alibi for murder
has been

23:51.230 --> 23:53.619
that they were busy planning
the same murder.

23:53.660 --> 23:55.890
If it weren't so frustrating,

23:55.930 --> 23:56.897
it would be interesting.

23:56.930 --> 23:57.965
Yeah, well, it worked out
for Peri Delancey.

23:58.000 --> 24:01.163
Six months on drug charges
beats life in prison.

24:01.200 --> 24:04.533
Why did you add a photograph
of the two Delancey kids?

24:04.570 --> 24:05.764
Only one of them

24:05.810 --> 24:07.903
is a suspect.

24:07.940 --> 24:10.647
A short while ago,
I obtained a copy

24:10.680 --> 24:12.944
of Mr. Delancey's estate plan.

24:12.980 --> 24:15.744
Now that he's dead, a large part
of his fortune goes into trusts

24:15.780 --> 24:18.681
for his sons;
millions of dollars

24:18.720 --> 24:21.086
they will be able
to access as soon
as they're 18.

24:21.120 --> 24:23.088
That's only one year away
for Graham.

24:23.120 --> 24:25.588
Also, the young man no longer
has an alibi.

24:25.630 --> 24:27.120
Peri Delancey has admitted

24:27.160 --> 24:29.048
she wasn't actually with
the boys that evening.

24:29.100 --> 24:31.227
So Graham himself could
easily have snuck back home.

24:31.270 --> 24:32.965
There's no evidence that he knew

24:33.000 --> 24:34.934
about Abigail's history
as a poisoner.

24:34.970 --> 24:38.531
The very topic I plan to discuss
when I confront him tomorrow.

24:38.570 --> 24:40.879
Isn't tomorrow Titus Delancey's
memorial service?

24:40.910 --> 24:42.730
Precisely.

24:42.780 --> 24:44.202
You heard what
you just said, right?

24:44.250 --> 24:46.002
You're planning
to harass a teenage boy

24:46.050 --> 24:48.109
while he's mourning
his father?

24:48.150 --> 24:50.687
If he's the poisoner, he won't
really be mourning, will he?

24:50.720 --> 24:52.813
You know, the police think
Abigail is their best suspect?

24:52.850 --> 24:56.809
I do. As I told you,
I do not share their suspicions.

24:56.860 --> 24:58.680
That's because you were
in love with her.

24:58.730 --> 24:59.879
What?!
Back when you were

24:59.930 --> 25:02.023
a kid when you were writing her,
you fell in love with her.

25:02.060 --> 25:03.721
You spent almost three hours
at her house today.

25:03.770 --> 25:05.692
And in spite of what happened
with Peri Delancey,

25:05.730 --> 25:08.096
no one thinks she's being framed
except for you.

25:12.070 --> 25:13.833
I was quite young

25:13.880 --> 25:17.179
when my father shipped me off
to boarding school, right?

25:17.210 --> 25:20.919
I struggled. I was different
from my classmates.

25:20.950 --> 25:24.078
I was, uh, well, I was more
intelligent. H was brash.

25:24.120 --> 25:26.645
So they tormented me
mercilessly.

25:26.690 --> 25:29.318
Yes, I remember you saying once
that you had been bullied,

25:29.360 --> 25:31.624
_ but I wasn't sure
if you were telling the truth.

25:31.660 --> 25:33.924
It happened. I overcame it.

25:33.960 --> 25:36.224
It was a different
time back then.

25:36.260 --> 25:38.592
There was no such thing
as harassment via text

25:38.630 --> 25:40.666
or circulation of cruel
cell phone Videos.

25:40.700 --> 25:43.931
No, my bullies had one tool
at their disposal: violence.

25:43.970 --> 25:45.938
So I was beaten.

25:45.970 --> 25:49.178
Fairly savagely
and with great frequency.

25:49.210 --> 25:51.644
That's when you started
writing Abigail.
Mm.

25:51.680 --> 25:53.910
She was being abused
and so were you.

25:53.950 --> 25:55.178
Uh, I meant what I said before.

25:55.220 --> 25:57.586
My-my interest in her
was academic.

25:57.620 --> 26:00.612
She was to be a subject
of study, nothing more.

26:02.220 --> 26:04.927
I confess,
as our correspondence continued,

26:04.960 --> 26:08.794
I grew more anticipatory
of her letters.

26:08.830 --> 26:11.719
They were a welcome distraction
from my life.

26:11.770 --> 26:14.591
They were an oasis from school.

26:14.640 --> 26:16.267
Well, it certainly sounds like
you had feelings for her.

26:16.300 --> 26:18.268
Perhaps but...

26:18.310 --> 26:20.232
nothing so mundane as love.

26:22.980 --> 26:25.175
I was adrift back then.
I had-had no purpose.

26:25.210 --> 26:28.043
My so-called peers made me feel
that that might always be...

26:28.080 --> 26:29.638
the case.

26:29.680 --> 26:33.684
Abigail, she gave me a gift.

26:33.720 --> 26:37.929
A view inside a mind capable
of murder.

26:37.960 --> 26:40.349
So she was your first.

26:40.390 --> 26:43.769
Killer, yeah.

26:43.800 --> 26:46.792
Without intending
to, she...

26:46.830 --> 26:49.367
she helped me understand
who I was and...

26:49.400 --> 26:52.938
and what I might do
with my life.

26:54.940 --> 26:57.875
You never told her you thought
she was guilty, did you?

26:59.110 --> 27:01.840
I didn't want her
to stop writing.

27:01.880 --> 27:03.643
I didn't think

27:03.690 --> 27:05.112
she'd be a threat
to anyone else.

27:05.150 --> 27:07.243
There was no point.

27:07.290 --> 27:09.850
I get that.

27:09.890 --> 27:12.029
But if she killed
Titus Delancey,

27:12.060 --> 27:13.721
then she's got...
Then she'll be
handed over

27:13.760 --> 27:15.398
to the police
and she'll be punished.

27:15.430 --> 27:20.163
But for now, I'd like to try
to help her.

27:25.440 --> 27:27.135
WATSON:
Graham.

27:27.170 --> 27:29.172
Hi.

27:29.210 --> 27:31.269
I'm Joan. This is Sherlock.
We met the other day.

27:31.310 --> 27:33.175
Yeah, you're the people
that took Anne away.

27:33.210 --> 27:36.316
Of course I remember you.

27:36.350 --> 27:39.410
How are you and, uh,
Zack holding up?

27:39.450 --> 27:41.452
The past two days,
our dad was murdered,

27:41.490 --> 27:44.755
our nanny was accused of the
crime and our stepmom confessed

27:44.790 --> 27:46.428
to thinking
about killing him.

27:46.460 --> 27:48.826
We're great.

27:48.860 --> 27:51.988
I know
it's a lot.

27:53.070 --> 27:55.334
Zack's pretty mixed up.

27:55.370 --> 27:57.190
Especially about Peri.

27:57.240 --> 27:59.435
He liked her a lot more
than I did.

27:59.470 --> 28:01.438
But our Aunt Susan's here now.

28:01.480 --> 28:03.698
She's-she's great.
She's taking care of us.

28:05.410 --> 28:07.446
Were you aware
that your father's will

28:07.480 --> 28:10.711
leaves you and your brother
a substantial amount of money?

28:10.750 --> 28:13.287
Yeah, I guess. Never
really thought about it.

28:13.320 --> 28:15.811
Why?
Financial gain
has motivated

28:15.860 --> 28:17.851
many a murderous endeavor.

28:21.030 --> 28:23.225
Wait a second, are you saying
you think I killed my dad?

28:23.260 --> 28:25.228
Your stepmother's confession
has weakened

28:25.270 --> 28:26.498
your alibi.

28:26.530 --> 28:28.760
We know that she
left your home

28:28.800 --> 28:30.939
in Bedford the night
of the murder.

28:30.970 --> 28:33.063
Your brother was in_ his
room watching teleVI5ion.

28:33.110 --> 28:34.737
It would've been easy
enough for you...

28:34.780 --> 28:37.499
No! No way.

28:37.540 --> 28:40.373
Everyone knows it was Anne or
Abigail, whatever her name is.

28:40.410 --> 28:42.275
She did it.
It's all in the papers.

28:42.320 --> 28:43.787
Do you have any notion as to why

28:43.820 --> 28:45.447
she would've murdered
your... father?

28:45.490 --> 28:47.481
Unlike you,
she had nothing to gain.

28:47.520 --> 28:49.317
No, but she and my dad
had issues.

28:49.360 --> 28:51.225
We haven't heard that
from anyone else.

28:51.260 --> 28:54.229
All I know is they got in a
big argument just last week.

28:54.260 --> 28:55.750
And I can prove it.

28:55.800 --> 28:57.495
Zack had learned
this new parkour move

28:57.530 --> 28:59.498
and he wanted me to film him.
Then I realized my dad was

28:59.530 --> 29:03.830
going off on Abigail
in the hallway. I got
it all on my phone.

29:10.110 --> 29:11.975
(indistinct arguing)

29:17.850 --> 29:19.386
Where did you get this?

29:19.420 --> 29:21.285
Graham.

29:21.320 --> 29:22.958
Police technicians

29:22.990 --> 29:24.821
were able to enhance
the audio

29:24.860 --> 29:27.124
so we could discern some
of what Titus was saying.

29:27.160 --> 29:29.128
As far as we can make out,

29:29.160 --> 29:31.264
someone had attempted
to access his tablet

29:31.300 --> 29:33.837
without his permission
and he was upset about it.

29:33.870 --> 29:36.361
He was crazy that day.

29:36.400 --> 29:38.368
He thought I'd tried to
steal it or something.

29:38.410 --> 29:40.230
Had you?
No.

29:40.270 --> 29:42.534
Of course not.

29:42.580 --> 29:44.275
You should know that,
as we speak,

29:44.310 --> 29:46.847
the police are attempting
to locate his tablet

29:46.880 --> 29:48.370
at the Delancey home.

29:48.420 --> 29:50.274
They're hopeful
that it will shed some light

29:50.320 --> 29:52.538
on the investigation.
Why would it?

29:52.590 --> 29:56.151
It's been theorized that...
Titus uncovered your secret,

29:56.190 --> 29:58.283
that he had evidence
of it on his tablet

29:58.330 --> 30:00.355
and his aim was using that
against you.

30:02.060 --> 30:04.597
You're a_ beautiful woman.
He was in a bad marriage.

30:04.630 --> 30:08.293
Perhaps he prevailed on you
for other services.

30:08.340 --> 30:10.296
That's not true.

30:10.340 --> 30:13.002
Mm? It was rather a heated
argument. And frankly, I'm...

30:13.040 --> 30:15.429
curious as to why you never
mentioned it before.

30:15.480 --> 30:17.300
I forgot about
it. He...

30:17.340 --> 30:20.468
Titus apologized. He
said he o-overreacted.

30:20.510 --> 30:23.115
It wasn't
a big deal.

30:26.620 --> 30:29.350
You-you understand
that I'm trying to help you,

30:29.390 --> 30:32.188
and I can't do that
unless you're completely
honest with me.

30:32.230 --> 30:33.322
Of course I'm being honest.

30:33.360 --> 30:34.918
I've always been
honest with you.

30:34.960 --> 30:37.929
Well, we both know
that's not true.

30:37.970 --> 30:40.530
What are you
talking about?

30:42.670 --> 30:47.039
I know that you poisoned
your father, Abigail.

30:47.070 --> 30:49.504
Why are you saying that?

30:49.540 --> 30:52.100
You said that
you believed me.

30:52.150 --> 30:54.072
I avoided the subject
whenever possible.

30:54.120 --> 30:55.644
Not all the time.

30:55.680 --> 30:57.341
You said you
believed me.

30:57.380 --> 31:00.087
In a letter dated
September '91,

31:00.120 --> 31:02.259
you mentioned the passing
of a beloved neighbor,

31:02.290 --> 31:04.258
heart condition.
You often ran errands for her.

31:04.290 --> 31:06.588
She was the unwitting supplier
of the nitroglycerin

31:06.630 --> 31:09.622
that you used to poison
your father, was she not?

31:11.630 --> 31:14.394
January '92, you wrote
that you were with a classmate

31:14.440 --> 31:16.192
at the time of his death, but...

31:16.240 --> 31:18.333
at trial you said
that you went to the store.

31:18.370 --> 31:21.168
Shall I go on? Because I can.

31:24.450 --> 31:26.543
I know the truth, Abigail.

31:26.580 --> 31:29.242
I've known for 22 years.

31:31.990 --> 31:34.083
Get out.

31:35.120 --> 31:37.156
Abigail...
Get out.

31:40.630 --> 31:43.019
(sighs)

31:49.470 --> 31:52.166
Hey. The guys
are striking out here.

31:52.210 --> 31:54.428
I mean, there's no sign
of Delancey's tablet.

31:54.480 --> 31:55.504
What about you?

31:55.540 --> 31:57.098
I don't know.

31:57.140 --> 31:58.641
I might have something.

31:58.680 --> 32:02.116
Looks like someone tried
to pry this drawer open.

32:02.150 --> 32:03.640
Other than you.
(chuckles)

32:03.680 --> 32:05.386
Give me some credit.
I used to be a surgeon.

32:05.420 --> 32:09.311
I would never leave
a mess_ like this.
(clicks)

32:12.530 --> 32:15.693
Well, why would someone
lock an empty drawer?

32:15.730 --> 32:17.425
Habit.

32:20.170 --> 32:21.535
(sighs)

32:21.570 --> 32:23.299
(drawer shuts)

32:23.340 --> 32:26.559
Well, we know from the video
that he was angry

32:26.610 --> 32:28.305
because he thought that Abigail

32:28.340 --> 32:30.171
had gotten ahold
of his tablet.

32:30.210 --> 32:32.701
Right? So if this
is where he kept it

32:32.750 --> 32:34.445
and if there was
sen5itive information

32:34.480 --> 32:36.277
about her past on it,

32:36.320 --> 32:38.413
maybe these scratches
made him suspicious.

32:38.450 --> 32:40.589
You know, my ex used to keep
her tablet in a case

32:40.620 --> 32:42.315
that looked just like a book.

32:42.360 --> 32:44.555
Maybe it's on one
of these shelves.

32:44.590 --> 32:47.286
(sighs)

32:59.770 --> 33:02.079
There are_five air vents
in this room.

33:02.110 --> 33:04.476
And the capital of Michigan
is Lansing.

33:04.510 --> 33:06.705
You know you're starting
to sound like your partner.

33:08.180 --> 33:10.068
(knocking)

33:10.120 --> 33:11.109
Well, don't you think it's odd?

33:11.150 --> 33:12.219
I mean...

33:12.250 --> 33:14.389
the room is not that big, right?

33:14.420 --> 33:16.615
There's usually one vent
for intake, and then...

33:16.660 --> 33:17.786
(knocking)

33:17.820 --> 33:20.357
...maybe one or two
to blow cold air.

33:20.390 --> 33:21.391
(knocking)

33:22.430 --> 33:23.749
Five is definitely overkill.

33:23.800 --> 33:24.789
How do you know that?

33:24.830 --> 33:27.390
My uncle was a contractor.

33:31.210 --> 33:33.405
Hey, check this out.

33:33.440 --> 33:34.771
This isn't a vent.

33:34.810 --> 33:37.335
It's just supposed
to look like one.

33:46.590 --> 33:47.648
(phone rings)

33:47.690 --> 33:50.056
Watson, I'm on route.

33:50.090 --> 33:52.058
I will be
at the Delancey home shortly.

33:52.090 --> 33:53.728
You can turn around.
We found the tablet.

33:53.760 --> 33:55.648
Was there evidence
he knew about Abigail?

33:55.700 --> 33:58.419
No.

33:58.470 --> 34:00.119
But I think you were
right last night.

34:00.170 --> 34:02.138
I think maybe Graham
did kill his father.

34:02.170 --> 34:03.535
What did you find?

34:03.570 --> 34:07.233
Videos of Titus with Graham.

34:07.270 --> 34:09.773
He was sexually abusing him.

34:14.350 --> 34:15.339
(door opens)

34:15.380 --> 34:17.541
Ms. Moore?
Tom Gregson.

34:17.580 --> 34:20.083
Appreciate you bringing
your nephew in to talk to us.

34:20.120 --> 34:21.758
Marsha Whitman, I
represent the family.

34:21.790 --> 34:23.485
How do you do?
This is Ms. Watson, Mr. Holmes.

34:23.520 --> 34:25.078
They consult
for the department.

34:25.130 --> 34:26.154
They're the ones
who harassed Graham

34:26.190 --> 34:27.623
after the service
yesterday.

34:27.660 --> 34:29.855
We, uh, apologize
for any violation of decorum,

34:29.900 --> 34:31.697
but as it turns out,

34:31.730 --> 34:33.129
it was absolutely necessary.

34:33.170 --> 34:34.489
If we hadn't spoken,

34:34.540 --> 34:36.360
we may very well have
never learned the truth.

34:38.910 --> 34:42.402
You recognize that, right?

34:45.280 --> 34:47.339
It's my dad's.
Where'd you get that?

34:47.380 --> 34:48.711
It was hidden
in your father's office.

34:48.750 --> 34:51.389
You tried to take it out
of his desk last week,

34:51.420 --> 34:52.887
not Abigail.

34:52.920 --> 34:55.480
GREGSON:
Maybe you were thinking
about turning him in.

34:55.520 --> 34:57.659
Or maybe you were thinking
about stopping him

34:57.690 --> 34:59.487
from hurting your
little brother, too?

34:59.530 --> 35:01.157
What do you mean
"hurting"?

35:01.200 --> 35:03.498
Graham, what's he
talking about?

35:03.530 --> 35:05.259
Nothing.

35:05.300 --> 35:06.722
It's okay, Graham,
you can tell us the truth now.

35:06.770 --> 35:07.828
I don't understand.

35:07.870 --> 35:09.599
Are they saying that...?

35:09.640 --> 35:11.164
Are they saying

35:11.210 --> 35:12.165
your father...?
I don't want to talk...

35:12.210 --> 35:13.563
with you about this.

35:13.610 --> 35:15.339
Graham?
No!

35:15.380 --> 35:16.369
I want you to leave.

35:16.410 --> 35:17.377
Both of you, now.

35:17.410 --> 35:18.570
I can't allow
you to...

35:18.610 --> 35:19.577
I don't care!

35:19.610 --> 35:21.214
Just leave now!

35:21.250 --> 35:23.241
Mr. Delancey is 17.

35:23.280 --> 35:27.614
He is within his rights
to talk to us alone.

35:40.230 --> 35:41.492
(door closes)

35:41.540 --> 35:43.496
What's on there
doesn't prove anything.

35:43.540 --> 35:47.237
What it proves is that
your dad was a monster.

35:47.270 --> 35:49.636
And it certainly suggests

35:49.680 --> 35:51.807
that you have a very
understandable motive

35:51.850 --> 35:53.602
for wanting him dead.

35:53.650 --> 35:55.515
You knew about
Abigail's past.

35:55.550 --> 35:57.472
That's why you used
nitroglycerin.

35:57.520 --> 35:59.784
That's not true.

36:01.690 --> 36:04.386
This is a report prepared
for your stepmother

36:04.430 --> 36:05.749
by a private investigator
she'd hired

36:05.790 --> 36:07.781
to look into your father.

36:09.800 --> 36:11.267
These are your fingerprints.

36:13.500 --> 36:14.967
Abigail's whole story
is in that file.

36:15.000 --> 36:17.867
A story which
independently inspired you

36:17.900 --> 36:20.266
and your stepmother
to conceive

36:20.310 --> 36:22.369
the same plan.

36:22.410 --> 36:24.549
It seems that killing your
father and framing Abigail

36:24.580 --> 36:27.606
was an idea whose time had come.

36:27.650 --> 36:28.912
Hmm?

36:28.950 --> 36:31.384
Only you beat Peri
to the punch.

36:31.420 --> 36:34.287
You procured some nitroglycerin
illegally online,

36:34.320 --> 36:36.356
ifI had to guess.

36:36.390 --> 36:39.223
A few tablets in your father's
bourbon and...

36:39.260 --> 36:40.488
it was done.

36:40.530 --> 36:42.521
I doubt very much
that you relish

36:42.560 --> 36:45.267
what your plan means
for Abigail.

36:45.300 --> 36:46.699
But...

36:46.730 --> 36:49.631
compared to the hell
that your life had become?

36:49.670 --> 36:51.467
To the idea
that your secret would get out?

36:51.510 --> 36:54.604
To the idea that it could happen
all over again to Zack?

36:55.840 --> 36:56.807
It must've felt like

36:56.840 --> 36:58.376
you had little choice.

37:01.920 --> 37:05.549
Excuse me. I'm looking
for Graham Delancey.

37:05.590 --> 37:07.512
His little brother just
called me in tears,

37:07.550 --> 37:09.859
saying the police came
and took him away.
Yeah, Graham is in

37:09.890 --> 37:11.687
with the captain
right now.
Why?

37:11.730 --> 37:13.527
BELL:
I'm afraid I really
can't discuss...

37:13.560 --> 37:16.393
You. You saw Graham
almost every day.

37:16.430 --> 37:18.921
Did you have any idea
what was going on?

37:18.970 --> 37:20.426
Miss Moore, please.

37:20.470 --> 37:22.791
Wait, what are you
talking about?

37:22.840 --> 37:25.729
HOLMES:
I didn't mourn your father's
death, not for a moment.

37:25.770 --> 37:28.273
But Abigail loves you.

37:28.310 --> 37:30.938
Like you were one of her own.

37:30.980 --> 37:33.801
And I know
you care about her.

37:33.850 --> 37:36.341
If you stay silent,

37:36.380 --> 37:38.689
she'll go to prison.

37:38.720 --> 37:40.745
Does she really
deserve that

37:40.790 --> 37:42.485
for something
that she didn't do?

37:42.520 --> 37:44.852
WATSON:
Graham, you can help her.

37:46.030 --> 37:47.725
And we can help you.

37:47.760 --> 37:51.366
You just need
to tell us the truth.

37:51.400 --> 37:52.697
WHITMAN:
I need a few minutes

37:52.730 --> 37:55.039
alone with my
client. Now.

37:58.610 --> 37:59.861
(Gregson sighs)

37:59.910 --> 38:01.434
What the hell is going on?

38:01.480 --> 38:03.334
_ _ BELL: _
Abigail Spencer came in.

38:03.380 --> 38:06.042
She ran into Graham's aunt
and lawyer in the hall...

38:06.080 --> 38:08.640
And they told Abigail
about Graham's father.

38:08.680 --> 38:10.045
Next thing I
know, Abigail

38:10.080 --> 38:11.684
wants to make
a confe55ion.

38:11.720 --> 38:13.415
She says she's the one
who poisoned Titus Delancey.

38:13.450 --> 38:14.781
Crawford and Gleason

38:14.820 --> 38:16.583
are in interrogation
talking to her now.

38:16.620 --> 38:17.780
She say why she did it?

38:17.820 --> 38:19.378
According to her,

38:19.430 --> 38:21.057
_Titus uncovered her
real identity a few weeks ago.

38:21.090 --> 38:24.423
He was using it to try
to extort sexual favors.

38:28.970 --> 38:31.461
(sighs)

38:36.380 --> 38:38.701
(sighs heavily)

38:40.780 --> 38:44.409
The district attorney will not
pursue a case against Graham

38:44.450 --> 38:46.338
without a confession.

38:46.390 --> 38:48.017
Which he is unlikely to give us

38:48.050 --> 38:50.985
now that you have confessed
to killing his father.

38:53.060 --> 38:55.551
Why did you do it?

38:55.600 --> 38:58.023
Kill Titus?
I already explained that.

38:58.060 --> 39:00.961
No, why did you confess to
a murder that you didn't commit?

39:01.000 --> 39:02.968
I am a murderer.

39:03.000 --> 39:04.900
You said so yourself.

39:04.940 --> 39:06.498
You were right.

39:06.540 --> 39:09.429
Graham poisoned his father.

39:09.480 --> 39:11.948
You and I both know that.

39:13.980 --> 39:17.040
Graham is an amazing kid,

39:17.080 --> 39:19.878
and he has his whole life
ahead of him.

39:19.920 --> 39:22.718
He shouldn't be in prison.

39:22.760 --> 39:26.548
There's no doubt in my mind
that I did the right thing.

39:26.590 --> 39:28.899
By killing Titus Delancey.

39:28.930 --> 39:31.728
You know, you don't even need
to do this.

39:33.100 --> 39:35.568
We have proof
of what Titus did to Graham.

39:35.600 --> 39:37.989
He committed murder under
mitigating Circumstances.

39:39.910 --> 39:42.799
It's unlikely he will serve more
than 18 months.

39:42.840 --> 39:45.149
18 months.

39:46.510 --> 39:48.569
That's about the amount of time

39:48.620 --> 39:50.713
you and I wrote letters
to each other.

39:50.750 --> 39:54.550
Felt like a lifetime,
didn't it?

39:55.960 --> 39:57.450
Especially when you're branded

39:57.490 --> 39:59.788
the kid who killed your dad.

39:59.830 --> 40:02.048
And Graham deserves better
than that.

40:02.100 --> 40:04.762
(whispers):
You're innocent.

40:04.800 --> 40:06.529
No.

40:06.570 --> 40:08.435
Innocent?

40:08.470 --> 40:11.598
He was being brutalized
right in front of me,

40:11.640 --> 40:13.938
and I should have seen it,

40:13.970 --> 40:15.938
and I should have stopped it.

40:18.550 --> 40:20.871
Soonen

40:23.020 --> 40:25.716
Titus got what's coming to him.

40:25.750 --> 40:28.412
And now, so am I.

40:30.890 --> 40:34.087
Finally.

40:34.130 --> 40:36.655
(sighs)

40:41.600 --> 40:44.706
Thank you for agreeing
to speak with me.

40:44.740 --> 40:47.538
My school is near here.

40:47.570 --> 40:51.108
My aunt thought it was too soon
for me to go back, but...

40:51.140 --> 40:53.574
I don't know.

40:53.610 --> 40:55.475
I'm tired of being at home.

40:55.520 --> 40:59.809
Abigail's confession aside,
you and I both know the truth.

41:01.150 --> 41:03.880
I'm gonna be watching you.

41:03.920 --> 41:07.219
And if you resort to those...

41:07.260 --> 41:11.196
extreme tactics
again in the future,

41:15.870 --> 41:17.497
Is that clear?

41:22.980 --> 41:27.098
Have you spoken with anyone
about what happened to you?

41:28.880 --> 41:31.849
My Aunt Susan tried to ask me
some questions last night,

41:31.890 --> 41:34.211
but...

41:34.250 --> 41:37.014
It happened. It's over.

41:37.060 --> 41:38.857
Talking about it
won't change anything.

41:38.890 --> 41:41.654
You're wrong.

41:43.200 --> 41:45.566
I have never known a betrayal

41:45.600 --> 41:48.194
as—as profound as what
you've experienced.

41:49.640 --> 41:51.733
But I do know

41:51.770 --> 41:53.909
that being victimized is...

41:53.940 --> 41:56.238
is corrosive.

41:56.280 --> 41:59.977
And sometimes,
talking about it...

42:00.010 --> 42:03.070
that can help.

42:05.750 --> 42:08.082
So you ever want to...

42:08.120 --> 42:10.657
talk about it

42:10.690 --> 42:14.729
with someone who knows the story
in its entirety...

42:18.800 --> 42:20.859
...I'm at your disposal.

42:29.680 --> 42:32.001
