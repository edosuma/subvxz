14:03.710 --> 14:05.210
I have a selective memory.

14:07.247 --> 14:09.547
It's all rainbows and whales
I thought out here.

14:11.318 --> 14:16.855
This is the worst weather,
king crab weather
I ever seen in 25 years.

14:16.956 --> 14:19.958
Mother nature's
not being nice.

14:19.960 --> 14:23.261

This might seem crazy,
but it just might work.

We're going fishing.

14:47.220 --> 14:49.153
We're going fishing.

14:49.255 --> 14:50.555

[francis speaking]

15:31.231 --> 15:33.498
[cameron] I'm devastated.

15:33.500 --> 15:35.233
Completely devastated.

15:41.708 --> 15:45.009
I feel like I've got
an ice pick

[crewman 6]
I just don't know,

15:56.022 --> 16:00.825
Wind's like
185 miles over the ocean.

16:00.827 --> 16:04.796
To hover over
a pitching vessel
and drop a guy down

16:04.798 --> 16:08.099
And pick two guys up,
there's no way.

16:09.302 --> 16:13.504
This is not like, "come on.
Let's go, drop a guy down"

16:13.506 --> 16:15.406

Oh, there they are

Francis is in good hands.

we are headed back to dutch.

24:37.610 --> 24:39.410

24:46.953 --> 24:49.954
[rip] he's going
to get checked out
immediately by the medic

24:51.424 --> 24:54.425
And that's all we can do.

24:56.829 --> 24:57.928
[johnathan] they got him.

24:57.930 --> 24:59.263
They [bleep] got him.

25:00.533 --> 25:02.399
Wow!

25:02.401 --> 25:03.801
That was stressful.

25:05.137 --> 25:06.237
Those guys...

25:07.240 --> 25:08.539
The best of the best.

25:08.541 --> 25:10.641
At least it's going
to give this guy
a chance to live.

25:11.944 --> 25:15.446
Hopefully,
they can get him to safety,
stabilize him.

25:15.515 --> 25:17.214
I hope that guy is okay.

He's not out of the woods yet.

25:25.424 --> 25:27.358
[mike] 4,000 miles northwest.

25:34.000 --> 25:36.000
[bill] it looks a lot like
dutch harbor.

25:38.404 --> 25:41.338
[landon] they call this
the northern paris.

25:41.407 --> 25:43.607
[bill] paris in the north.

25:43.609 --> 25:45.109
I wonder
if people don't bathe.

25:46.245 --> 25:47.411
Yeah, let's do this.

25:49.081 --> 25:50.614
Oh, my god.

25:58.624 --> 26:02.259
And I know taking this trip
and taking this risk
to come over here,

26:02.361 --> 26:05.262
It's pretty bizarre,
and it's a, it's a reach,

26:05.298 --> 26:09.600
But any crab you put
on the market,
it's going to be valuable.

26:09.602 --> 26:11.735
Prices are going to soar.

26:11.837 --> 26:13.504
So, what's that shipyard
bill coming to?

26:13.506 --> 26:14.705
Oh, man.

26:14.773 --> 26:17.841

or four hundred
thousand bucks.

[bill] actually,
I'm headed down to the boat.

what I'm getting into here.

27:08.227 --> 27:11.328

so it's a house-forward.

I'm going to need
a cigarette when this is over.

28:04.216 --> 28:05.949
It's a wee one.

28:05.951 --> 28:08.619
[landon] we could probably fit
a few of those
on the summer bay.

28:11.223 --> 28:12.956
[bill] hey, capitan.

28:14.627 --> 28:15.826
How are you?

28:15.828 --> 28:17.127
[tobias] I'm good.
How are you, sir?

28:17.129 --> 28:18.262
You're tobias?

28:18.363 --> 28:20.564
-Captain bill?
-Yeah. Pleasure.

28:20.632 --> 28:22.299
-So this is it, huh?
-Yeah.

28:23.536 --> 28:24.935
How many pots do you haul?

28:24.937 --> 28:26.804
[tobias] normally,
I haul about 30 a day.

28:26.806 --> 28:29.406
[bill] because I really hope
we can run more gear,
you know?

28:29.408 --> 28:31.809
You see the way
it goes in alaska,
we run a lot of gear.

28:31.811 --> 28:33.711
I could take
more at one time,

28:33.713 --> 28:36.013
Less trips for
re-arranging moving gear.

28:36.015 --> 28:37.181
Yeah.

28:37.183 --> 28:39.216
-[bill] you're willing to
try it?
-Yeah, of course.

28:39.218 --> 28:40.617
I am open to improvement.

28:40.619 --> 28:41.919
Yeah.

28:41.921 --> 28:42.953
You got a plotter?

28:43.055 --> 28:44.488
[tobias] I got a plotter
I can show you.

28:44.490 --> 28:45.756
Show me
where you're fishing, man.

28:45.858 --> 28:47.524
Show me
where we're fishing,
maybe, huh?

28:47.526 --> 28:48.659
[tobias] yeah.

28:50.429 --> 28:53.330
So I think we put
the initial set up
shallower.

A lot of pressure.

42:28.914 --> 42:31.748
<i> It's just a shame</i>
<i> we had to lose</i>
<i> the coffee machine.</i>

42:31.816 --> 42:35.018
This is the first time
I've ever stopped
drinking coffee.

42:35.020 --> 42:38.955
[mike] <i> ...Captain sig</i>
<i> has a latte on his mind.</i>

42:39.024 --> 42:43.526
Normally, that would be
the comfort I go to,
and I'm not doing it.

42:43.528 --> 42:45.762
<i> Oh, we're gonna fix it.</i>

42:45.830 --> 42:47.363

That's a big one.
That's a big one.

43:11.122 --> 43:13.423
Oh, [bleep].
Look out. Look out.

43:13.425 --> 43:15.758
[freddy] whoa! Hang on...

Wow!

43:28.206 --> 43:29.405
Oh, god.

43:29.407 --> 43:32.508
That was a 65 plus knot
gust.

43:32.510 --> 43:34.177
[deckhands cheering]

43:37.349 --> 43:40.216
If that's the game
we're going to play the game,
we'll play the game.

43:40.218 --> 43:41.551
Onto the next spot.

43:41.653 --> 43:43.553
[indistinct cheering
and shouting]

43:50.161 --> 43:51.227
Crab fest.

43:51.229 --> 43:52.428
That's a good pot.

43:53.632 --> 43:55.965
Wow! Wow!

43:56.034 --> 43:57.433
[laughs].

43:59.104 --> 44:01.838
32. 32.

44:01.939 --> 44:03.206
Wow!

44:03.208 --> 44:06.009
<i> Yeah, baby.</i>
<i> Now we're making it big.</i>

44:06.011 --> 44:08.111
It all comes together,
you know?

44:08.113 --> 44:10.380
When you got a due,
you got to work hard.

44:10.382 --> 44:13.449
<i> We came out here,</i>
<i> we took a risk,</i>
<i> and it's paying off.</i>

44:17.956 --> 44:20.323

<i> But so far we're not coming </i>

44:26.998 --> 44:29.165
I'm getting a little nervous
about the whole thing here.

What do we got?

44:45.617 --> 44:47.717
[deckhand cheering]

44:49.354 --> 44:51.054
We got crabs.

44:52.223 --> 44:53.322
Yeah!

44:53.324 --> 44:55.958
Shut the [bleep].

44:55.994 --> 44:58.628
It's a big crab...

44:58.630 --> 45:02.465
[sig] <i> six crabs in nine,</i>
<i> ten hours</i>
<i> is a really good sign.</i>

45:02.533 --> 45:06.836
<i> We've been traveling</i>
<i> for miles,</i>
<i> so to see sign of life</i>

45:06.938 --> 45:08.538
Means that it can be done.

45:08.639 --> 45:11.107
It means that there is life.

45:11.109 --> 45:15.111
[mike] <i> captain sig</i>

45:15.113 --> 45:17.714
<i> To get a taste</i>
<i> of red king crab.</i>

45:19.250 --> 45:22.719
[sig] I would like to compare
what's going on in the fjords.

45:22.721 --> 45:24.954
We're going to find out
soon enough.

45:32.597 --> 45:34.630
[bill] <i> you know,</i>
<i> that's gorgeous</i>
<i> to get out of here today.</i>

45:36.234 --> 45:37.533
We got all the gear on board.

45:37.635 --> 45:40.636
We got fuel, we got bait,
we got provisions,
we got water.

45:40.705 --> 45:41.738
Bill, you're ready?

45:41.806 --> 45:43.005
-[bill] you ready?
-Yeah.

45:43.007 --> 45:45.108

46:15.306 --> 46:16.706
<i> Okay. Great. How is he?</i>

46:19.043 --> 46:21.210
All right. So you think
he's going to be okay?

46:27.852 --> 46:29.118
<i> I can't thank you enough</i>
<i> for calling.</i>

46:29.120 --> 46:31.654
That's great news.
Thank you very much.

46:31.723 --> 46:33.356
Right, I appreciate it.

46:36.161 --> 46:38.661
[rip on radio] <i> hey, guys,</i>
<i> I just talked</i>

46:38.763 --> 46:41.264
<i> And he's going to be okay.</i>

46:41.332 --> 46:42.498
He's going to be fine. So...

[crewmen cheering]

46:43.601 --> 46:44.600
Yeah, that's good news.

46:44.602 --> 46:45.902
[crewman 6] <i> yeah, baby!</i>

46:49.808 --> 46:50.973
[rip]
<i> when francis got injured,</i>

46:50.975 --> 46:53.609
<i> My heart freakin'</i>
<i> dropped through my stomach.</i>

46:53.611 --> 46:54.877
It was...

46:56.414 --> 46:58.748
Terrible.

46:58.783 --> 47:02.051
We had a tough winter
the winter before,
and now I have this happen.

47:02.053 --> 47:04.220
It's like [bleep], seriously?

47:04.222 --> 47:06.055
Really?
This is happening again?

47:08.059 --> 47:12.728
<i> We made a commitment</i>
<i> when we started this</i>
<i> and we're going to keep goin</i>

47:12.730 --> 47:15.431
I mean, that's what we do.
We never give up
over here, ever.

47:16.801 --> 47:19.101
It looks like francis
won't make it back
for this trip.

47:19.103 --> 47:22.605
<i> So, we just have</i>
<i> to get francis's replacement</i>

47:22.607 --> 47:26.609
It's just so intensive,
and if we're getting the crab,
we're going to need him.

47:28.046 --> 47:29.812
<i> We got to go make some money</i>

47:31.516 --> 47:33.416
<i> We have to,</i>
<i> we don't really have</i>
<i> any choice.</i>
