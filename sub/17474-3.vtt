<i>Previously on</i> "Smash".

00:04.695 --> 00:06.515
Go get me a Marilyn.

00:07.924 --> 00:09.624
This girl feels like Marilyn.

00:09.644 --> 00:10.844
You have to do another callback?

00:10.850 --> 00:12.070
It's Ivy's spark.

00:12.224 --> 00:15.806
<i>Marilyn</i> the musical?
No one is gonna buy it.

00:15.857 --> 00:18.309
We know what kind
of money you make.

00:18.360 --> 00:19.426
You're a waitress.

00:19.461 --> 00:22.196
I think she's a star.

00:22.230 --> 00:24.765
- I want to go back to work.
- And what about the adoption?

00:24.799 --> 00:28.669
You got it. You're Marilyn.

00:30.118 --> 00:32.118

00:45.487 --> 00:48.455
That was incredible.

00:48.490 --> 00:50.758
It was lovely.

00:58.333 --> 01:01.869
Tom hasn't sent you a copy
of the new song yet, has he?

01:01.903 --> 01:03.404
I don't think
it's finished.

01:03.438 --> 01:05.939
Great.

01:05.974 --> 01:07.875
Three weeks
till we start rehearsing,

01:07.909 --> 01:12.446
we've only got eight songs
and half the book.

01:12.480 --> 01:16.216
You know, Derek, I've been
reading a lot about Marilyn,

01:16.251 --> 01:18.752
and watching the DVDs,

01:18.787 --> 01:22.756
and I'd really like it if...

01:22.791 --> 01:25.426
I'd really like
to get together sometime

01:25.460 --> 01:28.929
and just work on her.

01:28.963 --> 01:32.933
Well, that's what
we're doing, darling.

01:37.372 --> 01:38.972
It's a joke.

01:40.208 --> 01:42.943
Of course we can do that.

01:42.977 --> 01:46.013
I'll have my assistant call you.
We'll put it in the book.

01:46.047 --> 01:47.314
'Kay?

01:47.349 --> 01:50.317
'Kay.

01:51.453 --> 01:53.153
So, let me
get this right.

01:53.187 --> 01:55.522
You got the part,
you get to play Marilyn,

01:55.557 --> 01:57.524
you're sleeping
with the evil director,

01:57.542 --> 01:59.493
- who's a total fox.
- He's not evil.

01:59.527 --> 02:02.028
He may or may not be evil,
but he's definitely a fox.

02:02.047 --> 02:03.964
And the problem is...

02:03.998 --> 02:05.999
Okay, I'm just
gonna say it.

02:06.033 --> 02:08.634
Do you think he gave me the part
because I slept with him?

02:08.669 --> 02:11.055
- I can't imagine that it hurt.
- I'm serious.

02:11.089 --> 02:13.941
For heaven's sakes, Ivy,
enjoy the sex,

02:13.975 --> 02:15.676
and don't think about it.

02:15.710 --> 02:20.314
You got the part.
You got the part.

02:23.151 --> 02:25.452
- They're beautiful pieces.
- Yes.

02:25.487 --> 02:27.187
If you sell them
on consignment,

02:27.222 --> 02:30.290
you make considerably more.

02:30.325 --> 02:32.126
I think I'll just
let them go.

02:32.160 --> 02:35.162
Okay.

02:38.333 --> 02:39.500
Those are fun.

02:39.534 --> 02:42.736
They were inspired by a pair Marilyn
Monroe wore in <i>Seven year itch.</i>

02:42.771 --> 02:45.473
I can see that.

02:47.092 --> 02:50.310
- 50 bucks.
- They're just knockoffs.

02:50.345 --> 02:52.513
I'll take 'em.

02:58.119 --> 03:01.305
- Hi.
- Karen, hi. Thanks for coming.

03:01.356 --> 03:03.390
Hey, another one of these,
please, for her.

03:03.425 --> 03:06.360
No, please.
Just a club soda.

03:06.394 --> 03:10.197
So, I wanted to talk to you
about what happened.

03:10.231 --> 03:12.900
I know what happened.
I didn't get the part.

03:12.934 --> 03:14.568
Look, the script and the songs
aren't even finished yet.

03:14.602 --> 03:16.203
There's a lot of changes
coming fast.

03:16.237 --> 03:19.239
We just needed someone
with more experience with that.

03:19.274 --> 03:20.874
Well, she's lucky.

03:20.909 --> 03:22.876
It's a great part,
and the songs are amazing.

03:25.079 --> 03:27.347
So, how do you feel
about being in the ensemble?

03:27.382 --> 03:29.616
Well, it's a terrific
opportunity.

03:29.651 --> 03:32.336
Well done. Very polite.

03:32.387 --> 03:34.021
Well, what am I
supposed to say, I'm pissed?

03:34.055 --> 03:35.622
Yeah, you should be.

03:35.657 --> 03:38.509
You got way too much talent
to be in the ensemble.

03:38.560 --> 03:40.527
Then why did you
put me there?

03:40.562 --> 03:42.563
Listen. Life is long.

03:42.597 --> 03:45.432
Theater is longer.

03:45.467 --> 03:49.135
It could take five years
for <i>Mariynl</i> to get to the stage,

03:49.154 --> 03:50.871
and a lot can happen
in five years.

03:50.905 --> 03:53.240
There you are.

03:53.274 --> 03:55.025
Dev.
What are you doing here?

03:55.076 --> 03:56.743
Well, you said you were having
drinks with the great director,

03:56.778 --> 03:57.744
I wanted to meet him.

03:57.779 --> 04:01.548
Sorry to crash.

04:03.017 --> 04:04.885
Dev. Dev sundaram.

04:04.919 --> 04:06.152
Derek Wills.

04:06.171 --> 04:07.888
Karen's told me
a lot about you.

04:07.922 --> 04:09.089
I imagine so.

04:09.123 --> 04:10.390
Pleased to meet you.

04:10.425 --> 04:12.459
Are you from, uh,
South London?

04:12.494 --> 04:13.760
Well done.

04:13.795 --> 04:15.379
I could hear it
in the O's.

04:15.430 --> 04:18.398
I'd forgotten
this game.

04:18.433 --> 04:19.399
University?

04:19.434 --> 04:20.666
Oxford, you?

04:20.702 --> 04:22.236
The other place.

04:22.270 --> 04:24.738
- I expect you got a first.
- I did, actually.

04:24.772 --> 04:26.890
That's a lot
of pressure.

04:26.941 --> 04:28.242
Sorry?

04:28.276 --> 04:30.077
Mum and dad
just off the boat,

04:30.111 --> 04:33.280
all that hope wrapped up
in little, old you.

04:33.314 --> 04:34.898
Congratulations.

04:34.949 --> 04:36.516
- I'm third generation.
- Of course.

04:36.534 --> 04:39.319
I should have heard it
in the O's.

04:42.957 --> 04:44.524
I just don't know
what you were doing there.

04:44.542 --> 04:45.959
You said the guy was a jerk,
he is a jerk.

04:45.994 --> 04:47.794
He's a jerk
who is now my boss,

04:47.829 --> 04:49.029
and I can take care
of myself.

04:49.047 --> 04:50.330
I know you can.

04:50.364 --> 04:52.833
"Oxford."
"The other place."

04:52.867 --> 04:54.501
What is the other place?
Cambridge.

04:54.536 --> 04:55.919
Of course!
I can hear it in the "O" s.

04:55.970 --> 04:57.704
We're Brits.

04:57.739 --> 04:59.806
That's what we do to establish
our place in the pack.

04:59.841 --> 05:01.508
So who won?

05:01.543 --> 05:03.343
Well, I got to go home
with the girl, didn't I?

05:03.377 --> 05:04.811
That display
was not for me.

05:04.846 --> 05:06.847
No, you're right.

05:06.881 --> 05:08.282
Got something much better
I want to show off to you.

05:08.316 --> 05:10.050
Well, I'm looking
forward to it,

05:10.084 --> 05:11.552
because all that British ranting
about what school you went to

05:11.586 --> 05:13.787
left me pretty unimpressed.

05:13.821 --> 05:17.824
How's this?-

05:17.859 --> 05:19.560
What movie
are we doing now?

05:19.594 --> 05:24.531
<i>Gone with the wind,</i> baby.

05:41.309 --> 05:43.444
How many more do I need to see?

05:43.505 --> 05:45.406
My eyes are
about to start bleeding.

05:45.440 --> 05:47.474
We can take a five
and start talking offers.

05:47.509 --> 05:48.826
Yeah, that sounds
brilliant.

05:48.877 --> 05:50.210
Okay.

05:50.245 --> 05:52.146
These are our top picks

05:52.180 --> 05:57.084
for DiMaggio,
Arthur Miller, and JFK.

05:57.118 --> 05:59.386
And I just got a call
from the agent.

05:59.421 --> 06:01.689
Michael Swift is available,

06:01.723 --> 06:03.757
if you're interested in making
him an offer for DiMaggio.

06:03.791 --> 06:07.328
He did a show
with you, right?

06:07.362 --> 06:08.329
Yes.

06:08.363 --> 06:09.563
Well, he's terrific.

06:11.182 --> 06:13.000
Well, is he...
Is he right for this?

06:13.034 --> 06:14.668
I've never seen him.

06:14.703 --> 06:18.772
Well, he's doing
that Bruno Mars show at La Mama.

06:18.806 --> 06:20.607
Well,
let's check him out tonight.

06:20.642 --> 06:25.012
<i> Yes, I would die
for you, baby </i>

06:25.046 --> 06:27.581
<i> easy come, easy go</i>

06:27.615 --> 06:29.383
<i> that's just
how you live </i>

06:29.417 --> 06:32.052
<i> oh, take, take,
take it all </i>

06:32.087 --> 06:33.537
<i> but you never give</i>

06:33.588 --> 06:36.757
<i> should've known
you was trouble </i>

06:36.791 --> 06:38.042
<i> from the first kiss</i>

06:38.093 --> 06:40.878
<i> had your eyes wide open</i>

06:40.929 --> 06:42.846
<i> why were they open?</i>

06:42.881 --> 06:44.398
<i> Gave you all I had</i>

06:44.432 --> 06:46.467
<i> and you tsed it
in the trash </i>

06:46.501 --> 06:51.188
<i> you tossed it in the trash,
yes, you did </i>

06:51.222 --> 06:53.690
<i> to give me all your love</i>

06:53.725 --> 06:56.193
<i> is all I ever asked</i>

06:56.227 --> 06:58.612
<i> 'cause what you
don't understand </i>

06:58.646 --> 07:03.083
<i> is I'd catch
a grenade for ya </i>

07:03.118 --> 07:07.388
<i> throw my hand
on a blade for ya </i>

07:07.422 --> 07:12.092
<i> I'd jump in front
of a train for ya </i>

07:12.127 --> 07:16.563
<i> you know I'd do
anything for ya </i>

07:16.598 --> 07:17.915
<i> oh</i>

07:17.966 --> 07:21.835
<i> I would go through
all this pain </i>

07:21.869 --> 07:25.472
<i> take a bullet
straight through my brain </i>

07:25.507 --> 07:29.676
<i> yes, I would die
for you, baby </i>

07:29.711 --> 07:33.063
<i> but you won't
do the same </i>

07:33.098 --> 07:36.784
Okay, he's sensational,
but is he interested?

07:36.818 --> 07:40.421
Well, apparently,
he's a huge baseball fan.

07:40.455 --> 07:42.856
Is that the same thing
as a "yes"?

07:42.891 --> 07:44.074
Jerry, hello.

07:44.109 --> 07:47.694
Derek. Great to see you.

07:47.729 --> 07:49.997
Eileen, hi.

07:50.031 --> 07:52.766
Hello, Jerry.

07:52.801 --> 07:56.203
Listen, uh, Derek,
I'm glad I bumped into you.

07:56.237 --> 07:57.604
You have to give me
one more chance

07:57.639 --> 07:59.640
to tempt you back
to <i>My fair lady.</i>

07:59.674 --> 08:01.809
Yeah, maybe we can talk about
that in the morning, Jerry.

08:01.843 --> 08:05.479
We could be going
by the end of the month.

08:05.513 --> 08:09.149
You look beautiful, Eileen.

08:09.184 --> 08:11.351
Nice earrings.

08:11.386 --> 08:14.288
Very quaint.

08:14.322 --> 08:17.391
Who gave 'em to ya?

08:19.594 --> 08:23.330
I'm sorry, I don't know
why that keeps happening.

08:23.364 --> 08:25.833
I'm such a klutz.

08:25.867 --> 08:28.168
- Should we get some menus?
- Sure.

08:29.937 --> 08:31.338
Well.

08:31.372 --> 08:33.373
In this business,
any job is a good one.

08:33.408 --> 08:36.710
Only don't call it the "chorus,"
it's the "ensemble."

08:36.744 --> 08:38.412
Although, if you ask me,

08:38.446 --> 08:39.962
that's like calling garbage men
"sanitation workers."

08:41.716 --> 08:43.799
It's a great project,
and the music is incredible.

08:43.835 --> 08:45.002
When does it start?

08:45.053 --> 08:46.320
Well,
it's a workshop,

08:46.354 --> 08:47.921
so they haven't finished
casting it

08:47.956 --> 08:50.474
or even writing it,
so their dates are flexible.

08:50.508 --> 08:54.394
- It's one of those.
- Wait, one of what?

08:54.429 --> 08:59.233
Just you end up missing a lot
of shifts with those things.

08:59.267 --> 09:01.318
And you know they pay
next to nothing, right?

09:01.352 --> 09:03.704
And you're already
taking this weekend off?

09:03.738 --> 09:05.739
I'm going to Iowa
for a baby shower.

09:05.773 --> 09:07.524
Yeah.

09:07.575 --> 09:09.193
If you're gonna keep doing
a lot of those workshops,

09:09.244 --> 09:11.245
that's the kind of thing
that goes out the window.

09:22.090 --> 09:25.225
Doesn't it want to be
a little more ballad-y?

09:25.260 --> 09:29.096
I like the Sinatra
swing idea.

09:29.130 --> 09:30.514
I just think it...
I think it needs more heart.

09:30.548 --> 09:34.301
I think
it sounds amazing.

09:34.335 --> 09:36.803
Thank you, Ellis.

09:36.837 --> 09:39.189
Here,
let me do that for you.

09:39.224 --> 09:40.440
I know, I know, I'm going.

09:40.475 --> 09:43.644
I have to get
the dry-cleaning.

09:43.678 --> 09:45.245
And you have to be
at the dentist at 4:00.

09:45.280 --> 09:46.747
- No, no, no!
- You're doing it.

09:46.781 --> 09:48.782
I'm getting
my teeth cleaned.

09:48.816 --> 09:51.485
"No, no, no."

09:51.519 --> 09:53.453
I like him.
Why do you not like him?

09:53.488 --> 09:55.822
I don't have to
like everybody.

09:55.857 --> 09:58.325
- You don't like Derek.
- Do you like Derek?

09:58.359 --> 10:01.411
I do, actually.

10:01.462 --> 10:03.297
You like Derek.

10:03.331 --> 10:05.566
I think he's talented.

10:05.600 --> 10:07.167
You know what?

10:07.201 --> 10:10.070
Those two tigers that ended up eating
siegfried and Roy were talented too.

10:10.104 --> 10:11.572
That's ridiculous.

10:11.606 --> 10:12.673
It's not ridiculous,
it's true.

10:12.707 --> 10:13.807
That was a tragedy.

10:13.841 --> 10:15.175
That's my point.

10:17.979 --> 10:20.764
Mr. and Mrs. Smith.

10:20.815 --> 10:22.349
That's all
Joe and Marilyn wanted.

10:22.383 --> 10:24.484
They just wanted to be
a normal couple.

10:24.519 --> 10:25.986
That's not
all they wanted.

10:26.020 --> 10:28.755
At this moment,
in this song, it is.

10:28.790 --> 10:31.658
Speaking of Joe, Eileen
and Derek apparently went to see

10:31.693 --> 10:33.327
Michael at that Bruno Mars thing
down at La Mama.

10:33.361 --> 10:35.195
They loved him.

10:35.229 --> 10:37.664
Well, if he's doing

10:37.699 --> 10:40.033
that Bruno Mars thing
down at LA mama,

10:40.068 --> 10:42.369
how's he available
for the workshop?

10:42.403 --> 10:44.254
It's closing on Sunday.

10:44.289 --> 10:45.872
I heard it was extending.

10:45.906 --> 10:47.708
Not according to
the agent.

10:47.742 --> 10:50.043
The agent.
Now that's a reliable source.

10:50.077 --> 10:52.012
Why would he tell us
his client was available

10:52.046 --> 10:53.513
if he wasn't?

10:53.548 --> 10:55.132
I just don't
want you to get

10:55.183 --> 10:56.683
your heart set on someone
who isn't available.

10:56.718 --> 10:58.602
And I'm not sure
he's right.

10:58.636 --> 11:02.522
Are you kidding?
He's perfect.

11:02.557 --> 11:05.993
You know, I don't love
DiMaggio as a character.

11:06.027 --> 11:08.195
Maybe we don't need him.

11:08.229 --> 11:11.531
Great idea.

11:11.566 --> 11:13.634
Let's do <i>Marilyn the musical</i>
without Joe DiMaggio.

11:13.668 --> 11:15.168
Hey, here's an idea.

11:15.203 --> 11:17.204
Let's skip Arthur Miller too.
And JFK.

11:17.238 --> 11:21.308
Let's do it
without men altogether.

11:21.342 --> 11:24.544
Chugga, chugga,
chugga, chugga...

11:24.579 --> 11:25.746
No, don't do it.

11:29.584 --> 11:31.218
That's a good one.

11:31.252 --> 11:32.319
I have to go on the bridge.
All right, here we go.

11:32.353 --> 11:36.023
Do it again.

11:36.057 --> 11:37.090
I know,
I like this game too.

11:37.124 --> 11:38.592
When does it start?

11:38.626 --> 11:41.495
Three weeks.
It's just a workshop.

11:41.529 --> 11:44.765
It's Marilyn Monroe
and Joe DiMaggio.

11:44.799 --> 11:46.266
And they just offered it
to you, right?

11:46.300 --> 11:48.101
It's a straight offer.

11:48.135 --> 11:50.170
Yeah, my agent's
working on it.

11:50.204 --> 11:52.873
But, you know, it pays,
like, 200 a week.

11:52.907 --> 11:55.342
Artie'd have to go
into full-time day care.

11:55.376 --> 11:57.744
It's Joe DiMaggio, honey.

11:57.779 --> 11:59.696
And Julia Houston
and Tom Levitt are writing it?

11:59.747 --> 12:01.081
Yeah.

12:01.115 --> 12:02.699
You told me you liked
working with them.

12:02.750 --> 12:04.584
I loved it.

12:04.619 --> 12:06.853
So, if you have any questions,
why don't you just call them?

12:06.888 --> 12:09.039
If I call, it's sort of
like saying yes.

12:09.090 --> 12:10.424
And that's
a problem because...

12:10.458 --> 12:13.260
Maybe I should
keep myself open for once.

12:13.294 --> 12:15.545
There's a lot going on
in television.

12:15.596 --> 12:18.131
So, you're gonna pass
on playing Joe DiMaggio

12:18.165 --> 12:22.636
for something that might
turn up in television?

12:22.670 --> 12:25.939
Daddy's crazy.

12:25.973 --> 12:26.940
- Want dinner?
- Yeah.

12:26.974 --> 12:27.941
- Pizza?
- Yeah, pizza.

12:27.975 --> 12:29.526
You want pizza?

12:29.560 --> 12:32.896
I'm so tired of revivals.
Aren't you?

12:32.947 --> 12:34.898
What are the specs?

12:34.949 --> 12:38.385
Well, it's not
going to be cheap.

12:38.419 --> 12:41.054
But given that we're
taking on Marilyn Monroe,

12:41.089 --> 12:42.489
you wouldn't
expect it to be.

12:42.523 --> 12:44.057
And what's
Jerry's involvement,

12:44.092 --> 12:46.426
now that the two of you
are split up?

12:46.461 --> 12:49.463
Jerry has no involvement.

12:49.497 --> 12:51.398
Really?

12:51.432 --> 12:52.716
You think that you can raise
all this money yourself?

12:52.750 --> 12:56.403
I'm producing it myself.

12:56.437 --> 12:57.671
Which you've
never done before.

12:57.705 --> 13:00.240
And all your assets
are in escrow.

13:01.843 --> 13:04.344
It's only a workshop.
All I need is 200,000.

13:04.378 --> 13:06.680
Good!

13:08.549 --> 13:10.984
I can never figure out
what to pack for three days.

13:11.018 --> 13:12.986
Maybe I should
just stay home.

13:13.020 --> 13:14.755
You've been looking forward
to this for months.

13:14.789 --> 13:17.357
Let's be real. Baby showers
are not that much fun.

13:17.391 --> 13:19.359
She's your best friend.

13:19.393 --> 13:22.028
And she's holding
a baby shower in a karaoke bar.

13:22.063 --> 13:23.296
I think that
sounds like fun.

13:26.234 --> 13:27.834
I'm worried about money.

13:27.869 --> 13:30.003
If I go, I'll miss
four shifts at work.

13:30.037 --> 13:34.007
The workshop starts,
I'll miss even more.

13:34.041 --> 13:38.545
Karen, if you don't
want to go, then don't go.

13:38.579 --> 13:42.516
But you can't not go
because of money.

13:42.550 --> 13:45.519
I can cover us.

13:45.553 --> 13:48.054
I don't know
if I'm ready for that.

13:48.089 --> 13:50.390
Well, you don't have to
decide this second.

13:50.424 --> 13:54.127
Go home. Have a good time.
Then we can talk about it.

13:54.162 --> 13:56.363
You've already
paid for the plane ticket.

13:56.397 --> 13:57.964
And besides,
the entire state of Iowa

13:57.999 --> 13:59.866
would be crushed
if you don't show up.

14:01.652 --> 14:03.670
That's true.

14:03.704 --> 14:05.956
Come on,
let's get you packed.

14:05.990 --> 14:09.042
How'd you get
that job anyway?

14:09.076 --> 14:10.477
I mean, you walk
into New York,

14:10.511 --> 14:12.629
and Tom Levitt hires you
to be his assistant?

14:12.663 --> 14:13.914
He's huge.

14:13.948 --> 14:16.249
My mom knew
his brother in college.

14:17.885 --> 14:19.886
Slept with his brother
in college.

14:19.921 --> 14:22.255
- Are they paying you?
- Of course they're paying me.

14:22.290 --> 14:23.757
Tom pays me.

14:23.791 --> 14:25.158
I don't mean
paying you to get coffee,

14:25.193 --> 14:27.160
paying you for the idea.

14:27.195 --> 14:28.728
They should
pay you for that.

14:28.763 --> 14:30.497
I don't get paid for that.

14:30.531 --> 14:33.667
It's your idea.

14:33.701 --> 14:35.569
No, I'm good.

14:42.543 --> 14:44.711
What did they want?

14:44.745 --> 14:47.781
Joe and Marilyn.
What did they yearn for?

14:47.815 --> 14:52.035
They didn't want
publicists around all the time.

14:52.086 --> 14:53.787
They got tired of the phones
ringing all the time.

14:53.821 --> 14:55.872
What did they want?

14:55.923 --> 14:58.959
A nice, little house.

14:58.993 --> 15:01.928
A home-cooked meal.

15:01.963 --> 15:04.130
DiMaggio loved
his sister's meatballs.

15:04.165 --> 15:05.632
That's not
what they wanted.

15:05.666 --> 15:07.767
It is, actually.

15:07.802 --> 15:09.369
They also wanted
the phones to stop ringing,

15:09.403 --> 15:10.804
and their stupid publicists
to leave them alone.

15:10.838 --> 15:15.191
They wanted
a simple life together

15:15.226 --> 15:20.213
that was uncomplicated.

15:20.248 --> 15:23.783
Marriage is a good thing.

15:25.286 --> 15:26.987
"Marriage is a good thing."

15:27.021 --> 15:31.992
Who's arguing with you?

15:32.026 --> 15:35.595
"Marriage is
a good thing."

15:35.630 --> 15:36.897
What are you looking for?

15:36.931 --> 15:38.632
My... my notebook.

15:38.666 --> 15:40.300
I want to see what I put down
for the first draft.

15:40.334 --> 15:41.434
Where's my bag?

15:41.469 --> 15:44.137
It's in the kitchen.

15:44.171 --> 15:46.056
I had Ellis
call Eileen's office.

15:46.090 --> 15:47.807
They made an offer
to Michael.

15:47.842 --> 15:49.342
I'm telling you, Tom,
it's a long shot.

15:49.376 --> 15:52.378
He's not gonna do it.

16:21.590 --> 16:24.508
There she is.

16:24.543 --> 16:27.178
- What happened to the beard?
- Your mom hated it.

16:28.930 --> 16:31.232
Look at you.
You need help, mom?

16:31.266 --> 16:33.551
Let me get that, honey.
Y-you go on in.

16:33.602 --> 16:34.568
Okay.

16:36.638 --> 16:37.972
Bring half
of New York with ya?

16:46.398 --> 16:49.283
She didn't
get that big part.

16:49.317 --> 16:52.386
She give you any details?
What happened?

16:52.420 --> 16:55.089
You know, I can hear you.

17:01.079 --> 17:04.164
Your... your mom
was just filling me in.

17:04.198 --> 17:06.099
I'm fine, daddy.

17:06.134 --> 17:09.169
I didn't get the lead, but it
was a total long shot anyway.

17:09.204 --> 17:11.805
I'm gonna be in the ensemble.
I'm so excited.

17:11.839 --> 17:13.641
It's a workshop, so I'm...

17:13.675 --> 17:15.309
I'm getting in
on the ground floor,

17:15.343 --> 17:17.511
and the people
who are writing it

17:17.546 --> 17:19.413
are, like,
the top New York composers.

17:19.446 --> 17:22.148
It's... it's totally
a huge opportunity.

17:22.183 --> 17:25.819
So, what does
this workshop pay?

17:25.854 --> 17:27.521
200 a week.

17:27.555 --> 17:30.991
Will they hold your job
for you while you do it?

17:31.026 --> 17:33.327
Roger!

17:33.361 --> 17:35.629
I got it, mom. Thanks.

17:35.664 --> 17:37.281
Daddy...

17:37.332 --> 17:39.600
I'm really glad to be here.

17:39.634 --> 17:41.702
And tomorrow I'm going
to marlena's baby shower

17:41.736 --> 17:44.371
and for two days, I'm not gonna
even think about Broadway.

17:50.712 --> 17:52.212
Bye, guys.
We'll be at vintage.

17:52.246 --> 17:53.280
Bye, Luce.

17:53.315 --> 17:54.265
It hasn't been that long.

17:54.299 --> 17:55.716
It's been three days.

17:55.750 --> 17:57.017
Three days isn't long.

17:57.052 --> 17:58.218
Yeah,
if you're in high school,

17:58.253 --> 17:59.353
and your boyfriend
is an idiot.

17:59.387 --> 18:00.938
The theater
is high school,

18:00.972 --> 18:02.139
and directors are the biggest
idiots out there.

18:02.190 --> 18:03.807
Right.

18:03.858 --> 18:05.392
Are you two trying to make me
feel better or worse?

18:05.427 --> 18:06.961
Look, why don't you
just call him?

18:06.995 --> 18:08.662
Because I don't
want to be pushy.

18:08.697 --> 18:10.481
Every time Marilyn tried
to be pushy, it backfired.

18:10.532 --> 18:13.484
Marilyn was famous
for knowing how to dial a phone.

18:13.535 --> 18:15.502
What do you think it means
that we never go to his place?

18:15.537 --> 18:16.670
Why don't you ask him?

18:16.705 --> 18:18.505
Why don't you
just call Derek?

18:18.540 --> 18:21.408
I'm getting a call?
What for?

18:21.443 --> 18:23.010
You've already
got the part.

18:23.044 --> 18:24.645
Derek,
what're you doing here?

18:24.679 --> 18:25.746
Well, that's nice,
I can go.

18:25.780 --> 18:27.381
- No, no, no.
- See ya, Ivy.

18:27.415 --> 18:28.882
We're outta here.

18:33.355 --> 18:35.022
I saw the show tonight.

18:35.056 --> 18:36.490
You were terrific.

18:36.524 --> 18:39.026
I look like a duck
in that costume.

18:40.962 --> 18:43.347
A very fetching duck.

18:56.611 --> 18:59.246
What's that?

18:59.280 --> 19:02.016
Julia's notebook.

19:02.050 --> 19:05.185
Julia's notebook?
What are you doing with it?

19:05.220 --> 19:06.720
I took it.

19:06.755 --> 19:08.288
You took it?

19:08.323 --> 19:09.723
Well,
you gave me the idea.

19:09.758 --> 19:11.625
I did not.

19:11.660 --> 19:12.860
Okay, you said
they should be paying me,

19:12.894 --> 19:14.895
and they should.

19:14.929 --> 19:16.230
And they're not.

19:16.264 --> 19:18.632
That Julia
has it in for me.

19:18.667 --> 19:20.300
Seriously, she's a problem,

19:20.335 --> 19:22.903
and I'm not just gonna
lie down for it.

19:22.937 --> 19:24.738
I'm allowed
to defend myself, right?

19:24.773 --> 19:28.392
By stealing from her?

19:28.443 --> 19:30.027
I'm gonna give it back.

19:30.061 --> 19:31.712
I never said I wasn't
gonna give it back,

19:31.746 --> 19:35.032
I just want to see
if there's anything interesting.

19:35.066 --> 19:36.216
Is there?

19:36.251 --> 19:39.053
Mostly song lyrics,
but...

19:39.087 --> 19:40.387
Hang on.

19:40.422 --> 19:42.790
What?

19:43.825 --> 19:45.459
I wanna see it.

19:45.493 --> 19:46.460
You little spy.

19:46.494 --> 19:48.829
I'm a spy now.

19:48.863 --> 19:50.464
You're a secret agent.

19:50.498 --> 19:53.500
That's right I am.

19:56.271 --> 19:59.373
- He's so beautiful.
- I know.

20:03.278 --> 20:06.580
I just want to be
a great father.

20:06.614 --> 20:10.918
Theater's
so irresponsible, and...

20:10.952 --> 20:15.689
I need to support us.
I need to support him.

20:15.724 --> 20:20.027
You need to be
the best man that you can be.

20:22.130 --> 20:27.101
I think that Artie would love to
see his dad play Joe DiMaggio.

20:27.135 --> 20:32.106
Even for $200 a week.

20:47.255 --> 20:50.457
Michael.

20:50.492 --> 20:52.359
Julia, hi.

20:52.393 --> 20:53.694
I didn't expect
to see you here.

20:53.728 --> 20:57.564
Likewise.

20:57.599 --> 21:01.835
I wanted to talk Eileen
through the new outline.

21:01.870 --> 21:02.836
She's not in yet.

21:04.439 --> 21:07.207
Would you mind
giving this to her, please?

21:07.242 --> 21:09.510
I'll put it
right on her desk.

21:09.544 --> 21:11.144
Thanks.

21:14.448 --> 21:16.250
Show's great.

21:16.284 --> 21:18.418
Well, it's not really
a show yet.

21:18.453 --> 21:20.521
It's just a concept
and a few songs.

21:20.555 --> 21:21.922
It's more than that.

21:21.956 --> 21:24.525
I think what you have
is terrific.

21:24.559 --> 21:26.593
I'm in.

21:27.796 --> 21:31.231
That's great.

21:31.266 --> 21:32.933
When we didn't
hear from you right away,

21:32.967 --> 21:35.169
I-I-I thought
that you might pass.

21:35.203 --> 21:40.324
Yeah, I thought
I might too.

21:40.358 --> 21:42.276
How's Frank?

21:42.310 --> 21:44.211
- He's great.
- And Leo?

21:44.245 --> 21:46.346
He's great too.

21:47.715 --> 21:50.684
- I got married.
- I heard. Yeah.

21:50.718 --> 21:52.786
I have a kid.

21:52.821 --> 21:55.422
That's...

21:55.456 --> 21:57.457
That's great.

22:07.235 --> 22:12.222
You smell good.

22:15.577 --> 22:17.578
See you in rehearsal.

22:17.612 --> 22:19.613
Yeah.

22:31.670 --> 22:34.022
- Excuse me, Mrs. Rand.
- Yes.

22:34.056 --> 22:38.176
A gentleman at the bar
sent this over for you.

22:42.976 --> 22:44.409
Someone at the bar
sent me this?

22:44.444 --> 22:49.181
And he also thought
you would like this.

22:49.215 --> 22:51.316
It's a Manhattan.

22:54.621 --> 22:56.488
It's for throwing.

22:56.523 --> 22:58.490
I'm meeting someone,
Jerry.

22:58.525 --> 22:59.792
Manny Azenberg.

22:59.826 --> 23:01.360
I bumped into him
this afternoon.

23:01.394 --> 23:02.795
He told me you were
having dinner

23:02.829 --> 23:05.631
to talk about
this "Marilyn" thing.

23:05.665 --> 23:07.099
I said there had to be
some mistake,

23:07.133 --> 23:09.368
because you and I
were having dinner.

23:09.402 --> 23:11.537
For goodness sake.

23:11.571 --> 23:14.673
Eileen.
Have dinner with me.

23:14.707 --> 23:16.542
I'm not having dinner
with you.

23:16.576 --> 23:19.278
- You're divorcing me.
- You're divorcing me.

23:19.312 --> 23:20.712
Yes, I am.
Go back to your blondes.

23:20.747 --> 23:21.880
They're boring.

23:21.915 --> 23:24.183
They all blend together.

23:24.217 --> 23:27.953
You never do.

23:27.987 --> 23:30.656
You like the earrings?

23:30.690 --> 23:34.226
They're lovely.
You have exquisite taste.

23:34.260 --> 23:36.061
When you weren't
cheating on me,

23:36.095 --> 23:39.298
it was one of the things
I really enjoyed about you.

23:39.332 --> 23:44.303
I saw them in the window
of a little boutique in Soho.

23:46.005 --> 23:50.008
They look so much like you.

23:50.043 --> 23:52.344
Come here.

23:52.378 --> 23:53.478
- Don't even...
- Come here.

23:53.513 --> 23:57.416
Try touching me.

23:57.450 --> 23:59.668
Fine.

23:59.719 --> 24:04.089
Look, Manny is, in fact,
interested in <i>Marilyn.</i>

24:04.123 --> 24:06.024
He's ready to come in.

24:06.059 --> 24:08.660
He hasn't even seen the specs.

24:08.695 --> 24:11.263
I was gonna walk him
through them tonight.

24:11.297 --> 24:13.665
Eileen, I talked to him.
He's in.

24:13.700 --> 24:15.167
For crying out loud.

24:15.201 --> 24:16.902
What do you think
you're doing?

24:16.936 --> 24:19.371
I think I'm helping you
get your musical produced.

24:19.405 --> 24:20.739
That's what I thought
you thought you were doing,

24:20.773 --> 24:22.174
but you know what?

24:22.208 --> 24:23.525
That's not
what you're doing.

24:23.576 --> 24:26.211
One of the last great
theater producers

24:26.246 --> 24:29.281
has signed on
to your little... musical.

24:29.315 --> 24:30.682
Because of me.

24:30.717 --> 24:33.418
You know those earrings
you made fun of?

24:33.453 --> 24:34.853
Well, clearly you thought

24:34.888 --> 24:36.889
someone else
had bought them for me.

24:36.923 --> 24:38.457
And that's what
pissed you off.

24:38.491 --> 24:40.225
And that's what this
is all about.

24:40.260 --> 24:43.362
Come on.

24:43.396 --> 24:47.366
I bought them myself,
Jerry.

24:47.400 --> 24:49.401
I bought those earrings
for myself.

24:49.435 --> 24:51.436
And you know what?

24:51.471 --> 24:56.475
This is my musical,
and I am producing it by myself.

25:07.906 --> 25:10.657
This is great. I didn't even
know it was back here.

25:10.692 --> 25:12.943
And the food is amazing.

25:12.977 --> 25:14.578
So, how are things
at <i>Heaven on earth?</i>

25:14.612 --> 25:16.446
Fine. Terrific.

25:16.481 --> 25:18.682
It's such a fun show
to do every night.

25:18.716 --> 25:20.250
I know your contract
is coming up.

25:20.285 --> 25:22.169
Well, yeah.

25:22.203 --> 25:23.921
Unfortunately, I don't have
a clue about the running costs,

25:23.955 --> 25:25.022
so I don't know what
they're gonna be offering

25:25.056 --> 25:26.423
by way of a bump.

25:26.457 --> 25:28.058
But I know everyone
wants you to stay,

25:28.092 --> 25:29.593
and hopes you will stay.

25:29.627 --> 25:31.528
I-I don't need a...

25:31.563 --> 25:34.298
That's not why
I asked you to lunch.

25:34.332 --> 25:35.432
It's not?

25:35.466 --> 25:36.967
No.

25:37.001 --> 25:40.637
Actually, I was...

25:40.671 --> 25:45.642
I was asking you on a date.

25:45.676 --> 25:47.811
A date.

25:47.845 --> 25:49.913
Yes.

25:49.948 --> 25:51.748
I was feeling
kind of shy about it.

25:51.783 --> 25:53.066
But Ivy...

25:53.117 --> 25:54.651
You know, she told me
to go for it.

25:54.686 --> 25:56.620
And I thought, "why not?"

25:56.654 --> 25:58.088
She's dating Derek Wills.

25:58.122 --> 26:01.074
Why shouldn't I...

26:01.125 --> 26:05.295
Ivy is dating
Derek Wills?

26:05.330 --> 26:08.031
It's not actually
a secret.

26:08.066 --> 26:10.767
They're having sex
in the dressing room.

26:13.104 --> 26:15.072
Really?

26:15.106 --> 26:16.556
It is completely unethical.

26:16.591 --> 26:18.008
People have sex
all the time, Tom.

26:18.042 --> 26:19.743
It is hardly
considered unethical.

26:19.777 --> 26:21.511
He is taking
advantage of her.

26:21.545 --> 26:22.679
Maybe Ivy's
taking advantage of him.

26:22.714 --> 26:24.181
She did get the part.

26:24.215 --> 26:26.733
She got the part
because she was fantastic.

26:26.768 --> 26:28.785
And sleeping with the director
probably didn't hurt either.

26:28.820 --> 26:30.821
That's ridiculous.

26:30.855 --> 26:32.923
And by the way,
it proves my point.

26:32.957 --> 26:34.157
I don't think it does.

26:34.192 --> 26:36.076
It's show business.

26:36.110 --> 26:38.195
In shows, people...

26:38.229 --> 26:41.632
They sleep together.
It happens. It just happens.

26:41.666 --> 26:43.867
So, you don't care.

26:43.901 --> 26:44.968
Of course I care.

26:45.003 --> 26:46.970
I guess I just don't judge.

26:47.005 --> 26:50.090
Well... I do!

26:50.124 --> 26:52.843
Come on.
Don't walk away.

26:52.877 --> 26:55.095
Come on! Tom!

26:55.129 --> 26:58.181
- Hi.
- Ellis...

26:58.216 --> 26:59.383
I didn't know
that you were here.

26:59.417 --> 27:01.385
I was just
straightening up.

27:01.419 --> 27:03.353
He sounds really upset.

27:03.388 --> 27:05.222
- Yes, he is. Excuse me.
- Can I just... I'm sorry.

27:05.256 --> 27:07.024
What is it?

27:07.058 --> 27:08.358
I just feel like
maybe you should

27:08.393 --> 27:11.128
give him a little space
right now.

27:11.162 --> 27:13.664
Well, I think that
I don't need Tom's assistant

27:13.698 --> 27:16.166
explaining to me
how to handle him.

27:16.200 --> 27:19.069
You know what?
I'm gonna get you a cup of tea.

27:19.103 --> 27:21.571
No, I don't need you
to make me a cup of tea.

27:21.606 --> 27:23.156
What I really need...

27:23.207 --> 27:25.075
Actually,
you know what I need?

27:25.109 --> 27:28.545
Is for you to go.

27:28.579 --> 27:29.546
Can you go?

27:29.580 --> 27:31.314
Tom is upset,

27:31.349 --> 27:34.351
and he and I have a few things
that we need to work out,

27:34.385 --> 27:37.187
and we're gonna
need privacy to do it.

27:37.221 --> 27:40.090
But I don't work for you.
I work for Tom.

27:40.124 --> 27:41.992
You can't actually just order me
to leave his apartment

27:42.026 --> 27:44.728
because I don't
work for you.

27:44.762 --> 27:46.163
Listen...

27:46.197 --> 27:47.831
You should be careful
about what you say next.

27:47.865 --> 27:52.152
You have a real problem
with your temper, you know that?

27:52.186 --> 27:55.238
I fired you once.
I can do it again.

27:55.273 --> 27:57.207
You can sure try.

27:57.241 --> 27:59.109
And then we'll see
if it sticks,

27:59.143 --> 28:00.610
because it kinda didn't
the last time.

28:00.645 --> 28:03.113
Did it?

28:03.147 --> 28:06.016
I'm really glad
we cleared the air.

28:06.050 --> 28:07.000
And you know what?

28:07.034 --> 28:09.252
I found your notebook.

28:09.287 --> 28:11.204
It was underneath Tom's mail,
and he looked all over for it.

28:11.255 --> 28:15.759
And I knew you were
really worried about it, so...

28:15.793 --> 28:17.728
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

28:21.006 --> 28:22.106
- My God, there she is.
- My God!

28:22.140 --> 28:23.390
Hi!

28:23.425 --> 28:25.342
Karen Cartwright,
Broadway baby!

28:25.376 --> 28:26.343
Excuse me.

28:27.979 --> 28:29.396
Sorry.

28:29.431 --> 28:30.981
- Hi!
- Hi! Thank you.

28:31.016 --> 28:33.767
Baby. My baby.

28:33.819 --> 28:35.686
- Hi.
- Amy. You look so pretty.

28:35.720 --> 28:37.154
My gosh.

28:37.189 --> 28:39.790
That was a fast one
you pulled on me, Manny.

28:39.825 --> 28:42.059
Standing me up yesterday.

28:42.093 --> 28:44.962
Jerry wants something,
he can be pretty persuasive.

28:44.996 --> 28:49.700
Yes, well, we're here now.
Let me run you through this.

28:49.734 --> 28:52.303
Our Marilyn is a terrific
musical theater actress

28:52.337 --> 28:54.839
by the name of Ivy Lynn.

28:54.873 --> 28:57.474
She's a completely
thrilling talent.

28:57.509 --> 29:00.044
- She did a year in <i>wicked.</i>
- Yeah.

29:00.078 --> 29:04.014
I heard you're going to
do this without a star.

29:04.049 --> 29:05.983
Well, I'm glad to hear
people are talking about us.

29:06.017 --> 29:07.551
Who'd you hear
that from, Manny?

29:07.586 --> 29:11.388
Who do you think?

29:11.423 --> 29:12.723
Let me run you
through this.

29:12.757 --> 29:14.692
Jerry already did.

29:14.726 --> 29:15.960
Jerry isn't
producing this with me.

29:15.994 --> 29:17.228
Well, when he is,
let me know.

29:17.262 --> 29:20.231
No disrespect, Eileen.

29:20.265 --> 29:22.066
But I'm just
more comfortable

29:22.100 --> 29:25.736
dealing with him
on the business side.

29:25.770 --> 29:27.671
He wants to support you?

29:27.706 --> 29:29.740
Your boyfriend
sounds awesome.

29:29.774 --> 29:32.009
He is awesome, but I don't
want him supporting me.

29:32.043 --> 29:34.511
You know,
feminism's overrated.

29:34.546 --> 29:36.714
- What does that mean?
- It means don't be an idiot.

29:36.748 --> 29:39.416
It is awesome your boyfriend
wants to support you.

29:39.451 --> 29:42.152
And half our class
is already married.

29:42.187 --> 29:43.187
It's a pretty good deal.

29:43.221 --> 29:48.092
This is adorable!

29:48.126 --> 29:50.861
My God,
the baby's gonna love this.

29:50.896 --> 29:51.996
It's for you, actually.

29:52.030 --> 29:54.098
Really? For me?

29:54.132 --> 29:55.766
You're having a baby.
It's a big commitment.

29:55.800 --> 29:57.735
You're gonna
need a friend, so you...

29:57.769 --> 29:59.370
Hug him, and call me.

30:00.872 --> 30:02.189
You know nothing
about having babies,

30:02.240 --> 30:04.325
and you're gonna be
totally useless.

30:04.359 --> 30:06.193
That's true.

30:06.244 --> 30:08.946
Time for some karaoke!

30:08.980 --> 30:10.614
Hey, Broadway!

30:10.649 --> 30:12.449
- No.
- You wanna give me a present?

30:12.484 --> 30:13.617
Get up there and sing.

30:13.651 --> 30:14.618
Come on,
come on, come on.

30:14.652 --> 30:16.170
I just gave you a present.

30:16.204 --> 30:17.955
- You always...
- Come on. Hurry, hurry.

30:17.989 --> 30:19.790
Do I even get to pick
my own song this time?

30:19.824 --> 30:20.925
It's my shower,
you sing my song.

30:20.959 --> 30:22.626
- No.
- Yes!

30:22.660 --> 30:24.962
Great. Like I've never
sung this one before.

30:24.996 --> 30:26.297
I love when you
sing this song.

30:27.549 --> 30:29.934
- Can I eat that?
- Thanks.

30:29.968 --> 30:31.602
<i> Well, I ain't never</i>

30:31.636 --> 30:32.970
Yes!-

30:33.004 --> 30:35.272
<i> Been the Barbie doll type</i>
Yeah!

30:35.307 --> 30:37.474
<i> No, I can't swig</i>

30:37.508 --> 30:38.976
<i> that chic champagne</i>

30:39.010 --> 30:40.978

30:43.681 --> 30:46.450

Come on!

31:37.402 --> 31:40.454
Get up here, you guys!

31:42.740 --> 31:45.459
<i> Hey, I'm a redneck woman</i>

31:45.510 --> 31:48.612
<i> I ain't
no high-class broad </i>

31:48.646 --> 31:50.764

31:50.799 --> 31:53.517
<i> and I say, "hey, y'all,"

32:12.654 --> 32:15.372
<i> from the redneck girls

32:15.407 --> 32:16.990
Hell yeah!

32:17.042 --> 32:19.209
<i> I said hell yeah</i>
 Hell yeah!

32:19.244 --> 32:22.629
<i>  I said hell yeah...</i>
- Hell yeah!

32:22.664 --> 32:25.632
<i> Yeah...</i>

32:25.667 --> 32:29.136
<i> Oh, yes...</i>

32:31.456 --> 32:33.173
Thank you.

32:33.224 --> 32:35.893
All right.
All right, who's next?

32:43.368 --> 32:47.237
Derek, can I...

32:47.272 --> 32:49.106
Can I ask you a question?

32:49.140 --> 32:52.943
Sure.

32:52.977 --> 32:55.112
Why don't we ever
go to your place?

32:55.146 --> 32:58.282
Oh, God.

32:58.316 --> 33:00.084
What?

33:00.118 --> 33:03.087
It's ridiculous,
really.

33:04.722 --> 33:07.391
My neighbors
on the floor below, um,

33:07.425 --> 33:10.861
they've just
installed a new stove.

33:10.895 --> 33:12.196
- Stove.
- Yeah.

33:12.230 --> 33:14.064
You know,
one of those giant things.

33:14.099 --> 33:15.799
You know,
it takes up half a room.

33:15.834 --> 33:19.069
It's so big, it has to have
entirely new gas pipes,

33:19.104 --> 33:21.238
so they've turned off the gas,
and now they've broken the gas,

33:21.272 --> 33:23.140
and now I have no gas.

33:25.143 --> 33:26.777
You can laugh.

33:26.811 --> 33:28.712
But the whole building's
a wreck.

33:28.746 --> 33:30.781
My kitchen's a disaster area.
I can't even boil an egg.

33:30.815 --> 33:32.816
- No...
- It's not funny.

33:32.851 --> 33:36.420
No, no, I just...

33:36.454 --> 33:40.491
I thought you didn't want me
in your home or something.

33:40.525 --> 33:44.895
Darling.

33:44.929 --> 33:48.932
I want you everywhere.

33:54.973 --> 33:59.977
So, no worries,
all right?

34:17.795 --> 34:20.797
<i> nothing
can beat the view </i>

34:20.831 --> 34:22.179
<i> when as far...</i>

34:22.179 --> 34:24.534
<i> as the eye can see</i>

34:24.569 --> 34:26.003
<i> there's...</i>

34:26.036 --> 34:27.938
<i> No one but Mr.</i>

34:27.972 --> 34:30.841
<i> No one but Mrs.</i>

34:30.875 --> 34:34.460
<i> Smith and...</i>

34:34.512 --> 34:37.514
I'm sorry
we got into a fight.

34:37.549 --> 34:40.551
Me too.

34:44.722 --> 34:45.789
I've got to
tell you something.

34:45.822 --> 34:47.474
No, it's okay.

34:47.525 --> 34:49.560
I know I'm uptight about Derek,
and I need to relax.

34:49.594 --> 34:51.645
No. Well, yes.
That's true.

34:51.696 --> 34:53.397
But I've got to tell you
something else.

34:53.431 --> 34:56.065
Just the history with him
is so terrible, and I just...

34:56.100 --> 34:57.484
I love Ivy so much...

34:57.535 --> 34:59.136
I had an affair
with Michael swift.

34:59.170 --> 35:00.871
Five years ago.

35:00.905 --> 35:03.640
When we were
working <i>ready money.</i>

35:03.675 --> 35:08.378
I...We...

35:08.413 --> 35:11.415
Had a really...

35:11.449 --> 35:13.650
And it lasted for a while.

35:13.685 --> 35:18.655
And it was really...

35:18.690 --> 35:20.490
And I didn't tell you.

35:20.525 --> 35:22.526
And I didn't tell anyone,
actually.

35:22.560 --> 35:25.312
- Frank doesn't know?
- No one knows.

35:25.346 --> 35:26.930
Never should've happened.

35:26.965 --> 35:29.900
How did it happen?

35:29.934 --> 35:32.402
Michael is just...

35:32.437 --> 35:35.739
He was so good in our show.

35:35.773 --> 35:38.041
And you know
what a huge turn-on that is,

35:38.076 --> 35:41.345
when someone is just
so great in your show.

35:41.379 --> 35:42.746
Yes.

35:42.780 --> 35:45.716
That's all it was.
It was just...

35:45.750 --> 35:46.750
A show crush.

35:46.784 --> 35:48.952
But then...

35:48.987 --> 35:52.055
I was down at city hall,

35:52.090 --> 35:54.374
and I was gonna walk home

35:54.425 --> 35:57.794
over the Brooklyn bridge,

35:57.829 --> 35:59.696
and we bumped
into each other.

36:37.251 --> 36:40.470
- The Brooklyn bridge.
- Right.

36:40.505 --> 36:42.756
Right?
Sweetie.

36:42.807 --> 36:45.509
God.

36:45.543 --> 36:47.260
It's over.

36:47.312 --> 36:49.846
It's been over for a while.

36:49.881 --> 36:53.183
I just...

36:53.217 --> 36:56.453
Need to help me
not go back there.

36:56.487 --> 36:59.072
- And...

36:59.107 --> 37:02.360
No one else can know.

37:25.340 --> 37:27.074
Girls are coming
to pick you up?

37:27.108 --> 37:28.509
Yeah, they're taking me
to the airport.

37:28.543 --> 37:31.078
Listen, uh, Karen.

37:31.112 --> 37:32.963
- Dad, I...
- I wanted to talk to...

37:32.998 --> 37:33.964
- Now, hear me out.
- No, you hear me out.

37:33.999 --> 37:36.984
I'm fine.

37:37.018 --> 37:40.220
I'm great.

37:40.255 --> 37:42.890
Do you know that even being
in the chorus of a workshop

37:42.924 --> 37:46.093
is so much bigger than so many
people ever get to do?

37:46.127 --> 37:50.164
This is good,
what's happening to me.

37:50.198 --> 37:52.700
It's good.

37:52.734 --> 37:55.135
I'm good.

37:58.473 --> 38:01.275
I know, I...

38:01.309 --> 38:03.410
I just, uh...

38:03.445 --> 38:07.281
Want to give you this.

38:09.534 --> 38:11.919
- Dad, I...
- I'm your dad.

38:11.953 --> 38:13.520
I got... I gotta help out.

38:13.555 --> 38:16.823
Once in a while,
you gotta let me,

38:26.885 --> 38:29.269
You smell like smoke.
Why do you smell like smoke?

38:29.304 --> 38:30.871
I don't know.

38:30.905 --> 38:32.873
He missed church
this morning, too.

38:32.907 --> 38:35.309
Apparently,
he was out late last night.

38:38.847 --> 38:40.748
You were there?

38:40.782 --> 38:42.733
Well, I didn't
want to miss my chance to...

38:44.119 --> 38:45.986
I haven't heard you sing
in so long.

38:46.020 --> 38:47.654
You're really good.

38:48.957 --> 38:50.708
Come on, Broadway baby!

38:50.742 --> 38:52.426
Got to get you back
to the big time.

38:52.460 --> 38:53.460
- Yeah.
- -hoo!

38:53.495 --> 38:57.164
Okay.

38:57.198 --> 38:59.466
Thanks.

38:59.501 --> 39:01.001
Go on. Go.

39:01.035 --> 39:02.219
- By mom.
- Love you.

39:02.253 --> 39:05.072
I love you too.
