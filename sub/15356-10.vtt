00:56.590 --> 00:59.139
Grandma!

00:59.140 --> 01:00.980
I'm Prosecutor Kim Young Joo.

01:05.530 --> 01:08.629
Stealing meal money from the poor...
Serves him right.

01:08.630 --> 01:11.499
They say 2 police officers were killed too.

01:11.500 --> 01:14.360
What crime did they commit to deserve that?

01:52.290 --> 01:53.949
Get ready to tail Lee Yoon Sung immediately.

01:53.950 --> 01:55.580
He just walked out.

02:28.760 --> 02:31.359
Huh?
This is...

02:31.360 --> 02:32.789
This is Steve Lee's house.

02:32.790 --> 02:34.720
Are you sure you followed him well?

02:35.100 --> 02:36.429
I did.

02:36.430 --> 02:39.790
I didn't take my eyes off him, even ignoring
the traffic lights to follow him.

02:45.250 --> 02:48.370
Why in the world did you kill them?
Why?!

02:50.680 --> 02:52.759
Because that is my method of punishment.

02:52.760 --> 02:55.489
Does that include killing two innocent
police officers?

02:55.490 --> 02:58.619
This way will only result in
blood for blood revenge.

02:58.620 --> 03:00.430
In my ears, all I hear every day

03:00.431 --> 03:04.430
is the wailing of 20 people dying off
the shores of Nampo.

03:04.470 --> 03:08.499
Not once in 28 years,
have I slept peacefully lying down.

03:08.500 --> 03:11.579
There is just one reason
for which I continue living.

03:11.580 --> 03:13.999
What my comrades experienced
in the cold ocean at night,

03:14.000 --> 03:15.799
gruesomely shot dead by their own side,

03:15.800 --> 03:18.430
their pain, their rage, their betrayal...

03:19.710 --> 03:22.640
Those bastards must experience the same.

03:23.320 --> 03:24.889
Those bastards deserve to die.

03:24.890 --> 03:27.069
Who is that revenge for?

03:27.070 --> 03:27.959
What?

03:27.960 --> 03:30.170
I'm suddenly curious.

03:30.920 --> 03:34.339
Whether this is revenge on behalf of your
dead comrades betrayed by the motherland,

03:34.340 --> 03:35.699
or...

03:35.700 --> 03:40.060
self-torture driven by your guilt
of being the lone survivor.

03:42.100 --> 03:44.130
You still don't understand?

03:44.440 --> 03:49.209
The policemen you killed tonight had
families they were supposed to go home to.

03:49.210 --> 03:51.570
This is no longer revenge.

03:51.660 --> 03:53.740
It's just murder.

03:53.880 --> 03:56.670
If you end up in a face-off with me,

03:57.510 --> 04:00.239
you could die by my hands.

04:00.240 --> 04:02.360
I won't avoid it.

04:02.860 --> 04:05.760
Because I'm the only one who can stop you.

04:06.210 --> 04:08.560
I'm going to risk my life to stop you.

04:24.040 --> 04:27.610
What's this?
Did you follow me?

04:28.090 --> 04:30.539
Steve Lee... I thought you said
you didn't know him.

04:30.540 --> 04:31.950
Ah...

04:32.430 --> 04:35.309
Ah, I didn't.

04:35.310 --> 04:37.799
I was introduced to him today
by a classmate from MIT.

04:37.800 --> 04:40.639
He told me that the deer antler business was
promising so I should consider investing.

04:40.640 --> 04:44.760
Money's not to leave idle, but to roll out,
my father told me.

04:46.660 --> 04:49.130
So, you met him for the first time today.

04:49.680 --> 04:54.039
No matter how you explain, I'm not
dismissing you as a City Hunter suspect.

04:54.040 --> 04:57.110
City Hunter?
Me?

05:01.680 --> 05:03.589
You're heading for big trouble.

05:03.590 --> 05:06.180
You're the one heading for big trouble.

05:06.330 --> 05:08.419
On the day Lee Kyung Wan was delivered
to the Prosecutor's Office,

05:08.420 --> 05:10.069
the day Seo Yong Hak was targeted
by a sniper,

05:10.070 --> 05:11.109
the National Convention,

05:11.110 --> 05:12.739
the kidnapping case of Seo Yong Hak,

05:12.740 --> 05:13.869
the debate broadcast,

05:13.870 --> 05:15.826
where were you?

05:16.707 --> 05:18.291
Shall I tell you?

05:20.270 --> 05:21.099
<i>What?</i>

05:21.100 --> 05:23.389
Lee Yoon Sung's alibis turned out
to be perfect?

05:23.390 --> 05:26.259
We pulled Lee Yoon Sung's credit card
transactions and confirmed it.

05:26.260 --> 05:30.150
At the times they were authorized,
in the hotels he mentioned,

05:30.185 --> 05:33.979
he was captured on the CCTV in the elevators
going up to the guest rooms...

05:33.980 --> 05:36.570
Each time with another woman on his arm.

05:36.960 --> 05:38.959
He's really got some skills.

05:38.960 --> 05:42.819
Only on the night that Seo Yong Hak
was missed by the sniper,

05:42.820 --> 05:45.129
have we not confirmed his alibi.

05:45.130 --> 05:47.159
What about when he came back down?
Did you find that out?

05:47.160 --> 05:50.179
Prosecutor, we don't know
if he was there for an hour or a whole day.

05:50.180 --> 05:51.839
So how would we know
which surveillance video to search?

05:51.840 --> 05:53.199
And it's not like the hotels just have
1 or 2 elevators.

05:53.200 --> 05:55.239
They all have at least 6.

05:55.240 --> 05:56.199
What about the checkout time?

05:56.200 --> 05:58.600
Well, the woman could have checked them out.

06:00.250 --> 06:02.359
Should I check all the CCTV?

06:02.360 --> 06:04.020
Of course!

06:04.650 --> 06:07.110
I can forget about going home
for a few days.

06:08.090 --> 06:09.520
Just a second.

06:10.040 --> 06:13.069
The Ritz Hotel
that Lee Yoon Sung stayed at is here.

06:13.070 --> 06:14.639
The Plaza Hotel is here.

06:14.640 --> 06:18.020
The Kingdom Hotel is here
and the Marina Hotel is here.

06:18.030 --> 06:19.989
He was all over Seoul.

06:19.990 --> 06:21.270
Wait.

06:21.560 --> 06:24.619
The convention center where Seo Yong Hak
was almost kidnapped

06:24.620 --> 06:26.069
was here, right?

06:26.070 --> 06:26.849
Yes.

06:26.850 --> 06:29.750
And Lee Yoon Sung was at the Ritz Hotel
that day, here.

06:30.430 --> 06:33.320
That's only 7 or 8 minutes by car.

06:34.590 --> 06:37.869
The Kingdom Hotel
is really close to the SBS studios.

06:37.870 --> 06:39.089
The Marina Hotel

06:39.090 --> 06:43.130
is 4 blocks from Lee Kyun Wan's
book launching event.

06:44.000 --> 06:48.799
For an alibi, he checks into nearby hotels
with a woman and establishes his location.

06:48.800 --> 06:52.580
If Lee Yoon Sung is the City Hunter,
then he's a precise and calculating guy.

06:53.770 --> 06:55.289
Let's do a DNA comparison.

06:55.290 --> 06:57.079
I think we can get our evidence that way.

06:57.080 --> 06:59.559
Is there any way we can obtain
Lee Yoon Sung's blood sample or hair?

06:59.560 --> 07:01.512
Shall we ask the Red Cross

07:01.547 --> 07:03.069
and send a bloodmobile to the
Presidential Security Service?

07:03.070 --> 07:04.439
So they'll all donate blood?

07:04.440 --> 07:07.410
No, if Lee Yoon Sung refuses,
they can't force him to give blood.

07:08.240 --> 07:10.110
Can't you think of a good way?

07:14.690 --> 07:16.299
He killed 2 police officers?!

07:16.300 --> 07:17.529
The boss?

07:17.530 --> 07:21.740
Father seems like a runaway train
with broken brakes.

07:22.220 --> 07:25.250
For certain, he'll kill Kim Jong Shik
as soon as he returns to the country.

07:25.500 --> 07:28.860
What are we going to do with the boss?
He wasn't this bad.

07:29.050 --> 07:32.600
A broken runaway train can only be stopped
when it crashes.

07:32.610 --> 07:34.439
All I can do is make it crash.

07:34.440 --> 07:35.789
Then, what if you die?

07:35.790 --> 07:37.119
I'm prepared for that.

07:37.120 --> 07:41.379
Yoon Sung, Yoon Sung, what if...
we forget about all of this,

07:41.380 --> 07:43.489
go into the mountains and live quietly?

07:43.490 --> 07:44.860
No.

07:45.720 --> 07:49.140
Too many people have become miserable
because of those men.

07:49.550 --> 07:52.410
They must certainly pay the price.

07:52.520 --> 07:53.849
Right, you're right.

07:53.850 --> 07:57.059
It's too unfair for them to live
without a peep, right?

07:57.060 --> 07:58.046
But the problem is...

07:58.047 --> 08:01.339
Prosecutor Kim Young Joo
caught on something and is following me.

08:01.340 --> 08:02.640
What?

08:02.730 --> 08:05.580
He saw me coming out of Father's house,

08:05.590 --> 08:11.250
and he has the blood I shed
at the convention and the broadcast station.

08:11.480 --> 08:13.299
What did you do wrong?

08:13.300 --> 08:14.739
Putting it bluntly,
he couldn't catch the guys.

08:14.740 --> 08:17.349
We just caught the guys he couldn't
and handed them all over!

08:17.350 --> 08:19.960
He should be grateful instead.

08:20.030 --> 08:22.449
Don't you ever shed blood near him,
not even a nosebleed.

08:22.450 --> 08:24.790
Don't do anything risky, got it?

08:25.310 --> 08:27.760
Geez, this is really...

08:32.360 --> 08:33.729
<i>The so-called City Hunter,</i>

08:33.730 --> 08:35.929
<i>possibly frustrated that the
Assemblyman Lee Kyung Wan case</i>

08:35.929 --> 08:37.818
<i>was being poorly handled
by the Prosecutors Office</i>

08:37.820 --> 08:40.409
<i>is a suspect in the murder
of 2 police officers and Lee Kyung Wan</i>

08:40.409 --> 08:43.259
<i>in an effort to intervene directly.</i>

08:43.260 --> 08:44.569
<i>The Prosecutor's Office has not yet made</i>

08:44.570 --> 08:46.369
<i>any clear announcements
regarding the investigation,</i>

08:46.370 --> 08:48.800
<i>and there appears to be keen interest
in the case.</i>

09:14.560 --> 09:19.000
No... There's no way Lee Yoon Sung
could have done that.

09:19.520 --> 09:20.969
Absolutely not.

09:20.970 --> 09:22.860
Absolutely, absolutely not.

09:39.610 --> 09:41.880
It's the ahjumeoni from Madis.

09:45.980 --> 09:48.160
This man is...

09:51.750 --> 09:55.560
You seem young, but you're a doctor?

09:55.960 --> 09:59.080
Whoever your parents are,
they must be very proud of you.

09:59.170 --> 10:01.510
It's going to swell,
aren't you going to eat it?

10:03.470 --> 10:05.109
I lost my appetite.

10:05.110 --> 10:07.740
I don't have a mom to talk rudely to.

10:07.990 --> 10:10.899
I didn't have a mom to raise me,
that's why I'm like this, okay?!

10:10.900 --> 10:13.110
I don't have a mother.

10:16.570 --> 10:18.320
I don't even know her face.

10:29.850 --> 10:31.959
Because of 10 million won,

10:31.960 --> 10:34.340
students are taking leave or dropping out.

10:36.000 --> 10:39.480
And Myung Mun University
has more than 500 billion in reserves?

10:42.400 --> 10:44.930
What in the world are they doing
with all that money stored up?

10:51.220 --> 10:52.870
Are things going well?

10:52.900 --> 10:54.470
Oh, Ahjussi!

10:54.620 --> 10:57.279
What? It's been here for a couple days.
Let me drink it.

10:57.280 --> 10:58.960
You can't.

10:59.260 --> 11:01.799
You know I'm a patient.

11:01.800 --> 11:03.439
My goodness, Huay Ni...

11:03.440 --> 11:05.949
I would never begrudge Yoon Sung
any medicine, but he...

11:05.950 --> 11:07.819
he thinks that drink is too precious for me.

11:07.820 --> 11:09.669
Okay, all right. I'll buy you some.
100 bottles.

11:09.670 --> 11:11.520
100 bottles will do, right?

11:11.770 --> 11:15.099
But, don't ever touch this one.
Please.

11:15.100 --> 11:16.390
Why not?

11:17.390 --> 11:18.739
Somebody bought it for me.

11:18.740 --> 11:19.949
Who?

11:19.950 --> 11:21.350
Na Na?

11:22.590 --> 11:23.579
No.

11:23.580 --> 11:25.650
It is Na Na!

11:26.790 --> 11:28.830
- It is Na Na.
- Oh!

11:29.950 --> 11:31.159
Geez.

11:31.160 --> 11:33.040
Really, you can't.

11:35.320 --> 11:37.099
Two little lovebirds...

11:37.100 --> 11:38.540
I'm going to drink it.

11:44.530 --> 11:47.780
How did you get the bruise on your arm?

11:48.680 --> 11:51.150
I didn't know I had one.

11:51.430 --> 11:55.470
I was changing into a short-sleeve shirt
and noticed it.

12:00.250 --> 12:03.190
You don't have anyone attending you?

12:05.040 --> 12:07.219
That's correct, I don't.
I'm alone.

12:07.220 --> 12:10.219
Do you have any siblings or children?

12:10.220 --> 12:11.670
No.

12:12.950 --> 12:14.899
Your spleen felt swollen to the touch,

12:14.900 --> 12:17.570
and your blood test results have come out.

12:17.710 --> 12:19.289
It's not good news.

12:19.290 --> 12:21.779
You should be admitted right away.

12:21.780 --> 12:24.649
We'll get a hospital room ready immediately.

12:24.650 --> 12:26.990
A hospital room?

12:28.880 --> 12:30.990
It's leukemia.

12:32.220 --> 12:34.609
To find out if it's myelogenous
or lymphocytic,

12:34.610 --> 12:37.550
we'll have to take some more tests.

12:42.110 --> 12:43.779
You should register to be admitted.

12:43.780 --> 12:46.039
You'll need to start chemotherapy
right away.

12:46.040 --> 12:48.259
If it's myelogenous, then we need
to find a bone marrow match,

12:48.260 --> 12:50.900
and you should get a bone marrow transplant
as soon as possible.

12:52.780 --> 12:56.439
This is so sudden.

12:56.440 --> 12:57.669
It's urgent that you get treated.

12:57.670 --> 12:59.279
Let's hurry this process.

12:59.280 --> 13:01.669
Now then, Dr. Kim, help her out.

13:01.670 --> 13:03.470
Ah, wait...

13:04.580 --> 13:07.239
I wasn't able to close up my shop
before I came.

13:07.240 --> 13:12.190
Let me go and get my shop organized,
and then I'll come back.

13:12.320 --> 13:14.449
Then, go ahead and get that done.

13:14.450 --> 13:17.210
But, you must come in.

13:18.290 --> 13:19.980
Doctor.

13:21.590 --> 13:24.860
Leukemia isn't...

13:25.610 --> 13:28.100
hereditary, is it?

13:28.340 --> 13:29.900
It's not, right?

13:50.990 --> 13:52.620
Leukemia?

13:55.960 --> 13:58.960
I thought it only happens to other people.

14:35.000 --> 14:38.270
I've been living just waiting for the day
I meet you again.

14:43.070 --> 14:45.070
Will I be able to live

14:47.880 --> 14:50.740
to see you?

15:07.750 --> 15:09.800
I miss you.

15:10.820 --> 15:12.870
I miss you, Baby.

15:15.880 --> 15:17.860
I miss you.

15:44.600 --> 15:48.040
Give me one kiwi juice
and one orange juice, please.

15:51.910 --> 15:53.800
It's 12,000 won.

15:55.610 --> 15:57.850
I came because of Kim Jong Shik.

15:59.010 --> 16:01.170
I came because of Kim Jong Shik.

16:08.980 --> 16:10.510
Welcome...

16:14.280 --> 16:16.879
Just give me the best tasting coffee,

16:16.880 --> 16:18.770
and see me for a moment.

16:20.800 --> 16:22.049
Excuse me.

16:22.050 --> 16:23.779
If you're done ordering, why don't you move?

16:23.780 --> 16:26.000
Guest, be careful!

16:27.590 --> 16:30.329
You can't hit someone so hard.

16:30.330 --> 16:33.410
Ah, yes.
I'm sorry.

16:36.030 --> 16:38.440
This was in my baggage.

16:38.540 --> 16:39.910
Who is he?

16:41.750 --> 16:45.030
The person who caused my parents' accident.

16:45.290 --> 16:49.069
I gathered these to see
if a re-investigation is possible.

16:49.070 --> 16:50.159
A re-investigation?

16:50.160 --> 16:55.580
My father turned from victim to guilty party
overnight.

16:56.090 --> 16:59.250
There was a man named Bae Man Deok
who was an eyewitness,

16:59.360 --> 17:02.030
but he suddenly changed his story.

17:02.630 --> 17:04.539
I tried to find him later,

17:04.540 --> 17:08.520
but his citizen registry was deleted,
so I couldn't find him.

17:08.710 --> 17:11.628
But, a few days ago,
I saw him at a karaoke bar.

17:11.630 --> 17:14.369
I saw him unexpectedly and I chased him.

17:15.650 --> 17:18.390
But, that day,
the Da Hye video scandal broke.

17:19.680 --> 17:21.420
At a karaoke bar?

17:21.569 --> 17:23.049
What does he look like?

17:23.050 --> 17:26.730
He's bald, but has curly hair on the sides.

17:32.170 --> 17:34.269
Are you sure you weren't mistaken?

17:34.270 --> 17:35.739
I'm certain.

17:35.740 --> 17:39.440
Kim Jong Shik paid off that eyewitness
and changed the back story.

17:40.040 --> 17:42.710
He's a real bad man, that Kim Jong Shik.

17:43.320 --> 17:47.059
Then, what would you like to happen
to Kim Jong Shik?

17:47.060 --> 17:50.690
Nothing like dying or being killed.

17:52.410 --> 17:54.449
I'd like it
if the City Hunter would catch him...

17:54.450 --> 17:57.629
and deliver him to Prosecutor Kim Young Joo.

17:57.630 --> 18:01.670
I want it exposed
that he's not someone to respect.

18:02.290 --> 18:05.880
I'd like it if his hidden character
was revealed.

18:06.050 --> 18:07.299
Hidden character?

18:07.300 --> 18:10.240
I found out a lot about him
as I looked into him.

18:10.250 --> 18:13.910
That foundation...
holds a lot of corruption.

18:20.960 --> 18:23.060
City Hunter...

18:24.710 --> 18:28.610
wouldn't be someone
who would kill just anybody, right?

18:29.690 --> 18:31.250
How would I know?

18:31.870 --> 18:34.460
I believe he wouldn't.

18:35.110 --> 18:37.910
Then, you're probably right.
I'm going.

18:38.440 --> 18:41.910
Wait, Lee Yoon Sung.
Just a second...

19:25.050 --> 19:27.230
Ahjussi, you're Bae Man Deok, aren't you?!

19:28.550 --> 19:29.859
What happened?

19:29.860 --> 19:33.170
Why did you keep asking me
to watch over Na Na?!

19:34.460 --> 19:36.670
What in the world happened back then?

19:36.880 --> 19:39.430
Talk now and don't leave out a thing!

19:40.990 --> 19:46.369
Uh... uh, Yoon Sung, I'll tell you.

19:46.370 --> 19:48.710
I'll tell you everything.

20:56.520 --> 21:00.170
Mom! Mom!

21:00.670 --> 21:03.299
Who cares about this stupid little thing?!

21:03.300 --> 21:05.379
Mom, don't leave me.

21:05.380 --> 21:07.180
Mom!

21:46.320 --> 21:49.180
So, you're the eyewitness in this case?

21:49.510 --> 21:50.559
Yes.

21:50.560 --> 21:52.849
I'll get straight to the point.

21:52.850 --> 21:54.649
I think you'll have to change
your testimony.

21:54.650 --> 21:57.010
Change my testimony?

21:57.580 --> 22:02.510
I saw your car come and kill those people.
How can I change my testimony?

22:03.180 --> 22:07.079
I heard you received probation for gambling.

22:07.080 --> 22:10.939
What would happen if you were
to have been gambling that day?

22:10.940 --> 22:18.900
Gambling? I was at a friend's father's
70th birthday that day.

22:21.950 --> 22:25.789
I'm a man who could make it so that
you were at a gambling establishment.

22:25.790 --> 22:27.449
- Excuse me?
- If that happens,

22:27.450 --> 22:31.400
since you were on probation,
I suppose you'll be serving time in prison.

22:34.040 --> 22:36.449
The other party
is lying in a vegetative state.

22:36.450 --> 22:38.710
What's there to worry about?

22:38.960 --> 22:40.799
Let's change that testimony.

22:40.800 --> 22:42.430
I will compensate you.

22:42.480 --> 22:45.490
Enough to live off
for the rest of your life...

22:50.000 --> 22:51.255
<i>I seem like a fool, don't I?</i>

22:52.720 --> 22:54.639
Even though I felt like dying,

22:54.640 --> 22:57.190
I didn't have the courage to die.

22:57.670 --> 23:02.030
And when I think of Na Na,
living doesn't seem like living.

23:02.320 --> 23:03.949
It's all for the best.

23:03.950 --> 23:07.500
It's best that you know, Yoon Sung.
I feel better.

23:07.850 --> 23:09.969
Yoon Sung, I will...

23:09.970 --> 23:12.719
work hard to help you find out
about Kim Jong Shik.

23:12.720 --> 23:14.920
After I work hard to help you,

23:15.810 --> 23:17.390
I'll turn myself in.

23:17.810 --> 23:21.120
I'll turn myself in and pay for my crime,
Yoon Sung.

23:22.020 --> 23:24.980
I'm really sorry I wasn't able to tell you.

23:27.160 --> 23:29.810
So, Kim Jong Shik
is that sort of bastard, is he?

23:38.410 --> 23:39.569
<i>Kim Na Na.</i>

23:39.570 --> 23:41.059
<i>The personnel committee has decided.</i>

23:41.060 --> 23:43.459
During the attempted shooting
and attempted kidnapping of Seo Yong Hak,

23:43.460 --> 23:45.889
you managed the situation skillfully
and they recognize that.

23:45.890 --> 23:48.100
So, they've decided you will not be fired.

23:48.130 --> 23:50.209
- Excuse me?
- However...

23:50.210 --> 23:51.069
However?

23:51.070 --> 23:53.029
Don't even dream of guarding
a prominent figure.

23:53.030 --> 23:54.840
Just stay on Da Hye.

23:55.410 --> 23:58.070
And the 6 month salary reduction
is still going to be enforced.

23:58.430 --> 24:01.930
Yes, Sir.
Thank you. Thank you.

24:06.920 --> 24:09.110
That's great!

24:09.950 --> 24:12.539
I think I'm happier now
than when I first got the job.

24:12.540 --> 24:14.399
Since I'm in such a good mood, I'll buy you
ddeokbuki* (*rice noodles in spicy sauce).

24:14.400 --> 24:16.839
Of course!
If they fire a 4th degree Judo Black Belt,

24:16.840 --> 24:19.299
who's going to train the
National Communications Network Team?

24:19.300 --> 24:20.629
Of course, of course.

24:20.630 --> 24:22.600
Let's go eat ddeokbuki.

24:23.090 --> 24:24.909
Bodyguard Kim Na Na,
you're pretty impressive.

24:24.910 --> 24:27.369
You've been put on disciplinary probation
twice and not fired.

24:27.370 --> 24:31.670
It's a good thing I performed well twice
before the probation issues.

24:32.090 --> 24:33.790
Thanks to someone.

24:35.920 --> 24:38.139
Now then, let's start the training.

24:38.140 --> 24:41.760
It's not easy to find
such good-looking drillmasters.

24:43.570 --> 24:44.639
You call this training?

24:44.640 --> 24:46.769
Frankly, this is just tossing us around
to relieve your stress.

24:46.770 --> 24:48.740
Stress?

24:49.650 --> 24:51.079
Bodyguard Kim Na Na,

24:51.080 --> 24:56.180
the National Communications Network Team
seems to want some proper training today.

24:56.580 --> 24:58.950
That's not what I meant.

25:01.200 --> 25:02.579
What?

25:02.580 --> 25:04.190
Be reasonable.

25:11.250 --> 25:12.860
I'm sorry.

25:12.970 --> 25:16.320
Oh, I see...
So you think you've learned, is that it?

25:23.290 --> 25:24.859
Looking up close,

25:24.860 --> 25:27.450
I see you have really nice skin.

25:29.900 --> 25:32.800
Really, why are you like this to me?!

25:44.360 --> 25:46.030
Aren't you going to train me?

25:49.850 --> 25:51.700
Aren't you?

26:19.640 --> 26:21.170
I've learned.

26:45.800 --> 26:47.160
Here.

26:48.730 --> 26:50.270
There you go.

26:51.950 --> 26:54.670
Didn't you say we should at least
greet each other?

26:54.930 --> 26:59.200
I wasn't fired. Congratulate me.
For old times' sake...

27:01.400 --> 27:03.790
Ah, that's right.
My coffee secret...

27:04.050 --> 27:06.279
I wasn't going to teach you,

27:06.280 --> 27:07.859
but I'll be generous.

27:07.860 --> 27:10.389
In the break room cupboard,
there's coffee mix.

27:10.390 --> 27:15.060
If you use 2 of those and make ice coffee,
it's really good.

27:16.730 --> 27:19.980
So, even without me, enjoy tasty coffee.

27:20.630 --> 27:22.289
The amount of water is really important.

27:22.290 --> 27:24.099
You see the line on this cup?

27:24.100 --> 27:26.190
- If it goes over...
- Move it!

27:27.790 --> 27:29.440
Is this a greeting?

27:29.630 --> 27:31.580
Don't you have any pride?

27:32.350 --> 27:34.220
Why are you throwing yourself at me?

27:35.850 --> 27:37.820
Because I like you.

27:42.160 --> 27:43.640
Kim Na Na...

27:43.740 --> 27:47.180
Even though you always do as you like
and say obnoxious things...

27:47.540 --> 27:49.470
I like you.

27:53.960 --> 27:55.870
Didn't I tell you to forget about me?

27:56.000 --> 27:58.620
That night I just felt like kissing you.

27:59.120 --> 28:01.079
If every woman I kissed once
threw themselves at me...

28:01.080 --> 28:04.079
They'd fill Jamsil Stadium
and have to take a number and wait?

28:04.080 --> 28:06.090
I told you, you weren't my type.

28:06.100 --> 28:06.879
Your entire house...

28:06.880 --> 28:09.450
You'll wallpaper with mirrors?

28:10.170 --> 28:13.079
I know I'm not your type.

28:13.080 --> 28:15.770
You're not my type either.

28:16.900 --> 28:18.484
But...

28:19.121 --> 28:21.160
I still like you.

28:21.820 --> 28:25.330
I keep wanting to see you.

28:25.550 --> 28:27.380
You've gone crazy.

28:27.570 --> 28:31.820
I... know I'm pretty pathetic right now,

28:32.160 --> 28:36.520
but I want to be true to my feelings.

28:36.960 --> 28:38.999
I guess
I shouldn't even act like I know you.

28:39.000 --> 28:40.670
Pitiful.

28:51.740 --> 28:55.120
No.
You did good, Kim Na Na.

28:55.750 --> 28:59.236
Because liking someone is a good thing.

29:42.340 --> 29:43.409
You broke up with that woman, didn't you?

29:43.410 --> 29:45.010
You fought, didn't you?

29:48.630 --> 29:50.849
Dating a woman...

29:50.850 --> 29:53.629
You fight, you get along, you break up,
you get back together.

29:53.630 --> 29:55.490
I know how mil-dang...

29:56.180 --> 29:57.629
Well, that's a Korean style romance,

29:57.630 --> 30:00.080
short for milda* (*pushing)
and dag-gida* (*pulling).

30:00.770 --> 30:03.250
I'm an expert on that matter.

30:04.110 --> 30:08.800
I can tutor you sometime,
so you can take notes.

30:09.700 --> 30:11.910
You must have a lot of free time.

30:13.640 --> 30:16.270
Don't they do re-organizations
in the Presidential Security Service?

30:17.050 --> 30:19.960
Or not, if you don't want.

30:23.220 --> 30:25.870
Was the tuna sashimi I bought him
that time bad?

30:26.610 --> 30:28.310
He's brutal.

30:33.310 --> 30:36.299
It really was a good idea to come.

30:36.300 --> 30:38.909
I guess going to college is this great.

30:38.910 --> 30:41.089
I better study hard.

30:41.090 --> 30:42.339
You think you could go?

30:42.340 --> 30:44.639
Why not?
My grades have gone up a lot.

30:44.640 --> 30:47.470
What are you talking about?
They've gone up a fraction.

30:52.920 --> 30:55.999
Teacher! What are you looking at?
Just look at me. Just me!

30:56.000 --> 30:59.359
Hey, Kiddo Da Hae,
why should I just look at you?

30:59.360 --> 31:01.250
If you're going to keep acting this way,
then let's go.

31:01.360 --> 31:02.739
I don't want to.
I'm not going.

31:02.740 --> 31:05.680
You won't let me look at women.
This is total torture.

31:07.130 --> 31:09.760
Let go, will you?
Aren't you even hot?

31:10.020 --> 31:12.600
It's hot!
Why don't we have some ice coffee?

31:15.450 --> 31:16.790
What is this?

31:19.630 --> 31:24.029
Chairman Kim Jong Shik,
fulfill your half-price tuition promise!

31:24.030 --> 31:26.759
Fulfill! Fulfill!

31:26.760 --> 31:31.909
And the school, if you make a promise
of half-price tuition, keep it.

31:31.910 --> 31:35.550
We entered this school,
trusting that promise!

31:35.850 --> 31:37.439
[We're so tired and hungry, we can't study!]

31:38.340 --> 31:43.160
We're so tired and hungry, we can't study!

31:43.580 --> 31:48.579
If there is a future for us, young people
in Korea,

31:48.580 --> 31:51.100
try telling us there is.

31:51.250 --> 31:52.979
If we bear with the hardship,

31:52.980 --> 31:55.019
will there be joy
at the end of our troubles?

31:55.020 --> 31:57.520
Try telling us there will be!

31:58.520 --> 32:00.339
"We have no future"?

32:00.340 --> 32:02.689
Make do with triangle kimbap*? (*rice
wrapped in seaweed, shaped as a triangle)

32:02.690 --> 32:05.359
You can't study if you're hungry.

32:05.360 --> 32:06.879
Is it really that bad?

32:06.880 --> 32:08.559
It's bad.

32:08.560 --> 32:10.629
If it's 10 million won per semester,

32:10.630 --> 32:12.129
then a year is 20 million.

32:12.130 --> 32:13.979
They also have to be sent
for English lessons.

32:13.980 --> 32:15.769
And they'll have to have
some spending money.

32:15.770 --> 32:18.550
And if they're from the country, there are
transportation and living expenses.

32:18.570 --> 32:20.569
It's not easy to send kids off to college.

32:20.570 --> 32:23.810
They're basically saying, if you don't
have money, don't go to college.

32:24.250 --> 32:26.529
It was really hard for me to go too.

32:26.530 --> 32:29.580
Then, they're telling the people
to continue living their lives in poverty.

32:34.100 --> 32:35.839
I said clean this up.

32:35.840 --> 32:37.459
That's your job.

32:37.460 --> 32:40.189
Student, aren't you a little harsh
with your words?

32:40.190 --> 32:43.020
I didn't clean it up because
I didn't know you were finished eating.

32:43.470 --> 32:45.289
What is she saying?

32:45.290 --> 32:47.179
If I tell you to clean it up,
you should clean it up.

32:47.180 --> 32:49.990
How dare a loser like you talk back to me?!

32:51.780 --> 32:53.079
Look.

32:53.080 --> 32:55.189
Who's calling whom a loser?

32:55.190 --> 32:56.700
Who are you?

32:56.990 --> 32:59.739
You clean up what you play with.

32:59.740 --> 33:02.070
We learn that in kindergarten.

33:02.410 --> 33:03.629
Didn't you go to kindergarten?

33:03.630 --> 33:04.409
What?!

33:04.410 --> 33:07.479
Trying to stake your claims,
acting like you're thinking of your parents,

33:07.480 --> 33:10.229
protesting loudly in school
to lower tuition.

33:10.230 --> 33:12.249
And in reality,
you can't even throw away your own trash?

33:12.250 --> 33:15.269
What kind of world rotates around just you?

33:15.270 --> 33:16.289
What is he saying?

33:16.290 --> 33:19.289
If your character amounts to that,
paying an expensive tuition,

33:19.290 --> 33:22.070
you'll probably turn into total trash
if tuition is cut in half.

33:22.370 --> 33:24.670
I think you need an expensive education.

33:24.940 --> 33:30.429
Drink this, and throw it away yourself.

33:30.430 --> 33:32.330
[English Studies '09, Kim Hye Ji]

34:22.409 --> 34:23.668
It looks tasty.

34:23.670 --> 34:25.370
Where is he?

34:25.969 --> 34:27.978
Ahjussi, is that all my stuff?

34:27.980 --> 34:29.768
You didn't leave anything?

34:29.770 --> 34:32.429
Yeah, why?
Is something missing?

34:33.179 --> 34:34.560
No.

34:35.110 --> 34:36.159
Let's eat.

34:36.159 --> 34:39.610
Half-meat, half-noodle japchae*
that you like. (*stir-fried clear noodles)

34:50.280 --> 34:52.870
How is it so good, even if I made it?

34:57.170 --> 35:00.240
Since you made such a big fuss
about japchae with just meat...

35:00.830 --> 35:02.479
Try some.

35:02.480 --> 35:04.709
But I can't guarantee the taste.

35:04.710 --> 35:08.190
Even though you always do as you like
and say obnoxious things...

35:08.510 --> 35:10.510
I like you.

35:13.200 --> 35:15.200
I'm going out for a bit.

35:15.320 --> 35:16.539
Where are you going?

35:16.540 --> 35:17.859
I'll be a little late.

35:17.860 --> 35:20.409
I'm not even completely healthy, Yoon Sung.

35:20.410 --> 35:22.100
Yoon Sung!

35:23.660 --> 35:25.550
Oh, my...

35:30.230 --> 35:33.290
After exercising for the first time
in a while, I'm hungry.

35:33.430 --> 35:36.270
The Presidential Security
is really perfect for me.

35:49.690 --> 35:51.471
<i>I need a designated driver.</i>

36:09.651 --> 36:13.449
<i>This sense of excitement</i>

36:13.450 --> 36:17.182
<i>For the first time, I feel this way</i>

36:17.183 --> 36:20.851
<i>As if a spell was cast on me</i>

36:20.852 --> 36:24.689
<i>Every time I see you,</i>

36:24.690 --> 36:32.229
<i>Carefully, I want to tell you,</i>

36:32.264 --> 36:35.937
<i>Oh, I'm your lovely girl,</i>

36:35.938 --> 36:41.573
<i>While in your embrace</i>

36:41.574 --> 36:45.320
<i>Hello, hello, you shiny boy</i>

36:45.321 --> 36:52.650
<i>Cupid's arrow
shot straight through my heart</i>

36:53.760 --> 36:55.690
I'm here.

36:56.562 --> 37:00.441
<i>You got my heart!</i>

37:14.230 --> 37:15.409
You know since you've been there.

37:15.410 --> 37:17.950
The Ecstasy Hotel at the Dosan intersection.

37:19.930 --> 37:22.080
What are you doing?
Aren't we going?

37:22.610 --> 37:24.010
Yes.

37:29.300 --> 37:31.300
<i>That's a sweet smell.</i>

37:32.660 --> 37:35.210
Why did you open that button?

37:35.250 --> 37:36.702
I thought you might be hot.

37:36.703 --> 37:39.680
Why? Are you curious
about the color of my lingerie?

37:44.830 --> 37:47.029
Hey...
My ears hurt.

37:47.030 --> 37:48.850
Your ears hurt?

37:50.280 --> 37:52.259
You have so much appeal.

37:52.260 --> 37:56.009
I find short, slow-witted, sloppy,

37:56.010 --> 37:59.920
naive girls with no experience
totally unappealing.

37:59.930 --> 38:02.249
If you're even just a little bit nice
to naive girls,

38:02.250 --> 38:05.420
they overreact, thinking you like them,
and I can't stand that.

38:18.900 --> 38:19.600
Hey!

38:19.601 --> 38:21.129
Contain yourselves for just 2 minutes.

38:21.130 --> 38:22.719
In 2 minutes, we'll be at the hotel.

38:22.720 --> 38:24.039
Hey, are you not going to drive?!

38:24.040 --> 38:25.469
What's with this woman?

38:25.470 --> 38:28.739
Do you realize this sort of behavior
in a car is a misdemeanor?

38:28.740 --> 38:32.489
So then, do you want me
to drive straight to the police station?

38:32.490 --> 38:35.360
Hey, Button Unni...
Get out.

38:39.650 --> 38:41.200
Get out.

38:43.070 --> 38:44.749
What is with this woman?!

38:44.750 --> 38:47.119
I'll catch you a taxi, so get out.

38:47.120 --> 38:49.170
Seriously!

38:57.550 --> 38:59.340
Move out!

39:02.170 --> 39:03.459
What do you think you're doing?

39:03.460 --> 39:05.249
That's what I want to ask.

39:05.250 --> 39:06.349
Are you jealous right now?

39:06.350 --> 39:07.949
No.

39:07.950 --> 39:10.859
That woman isn't worth being jealous over.

39:10.860 --> 39:13.409
If you're doing this to push me away,

39:13.410 --> 39:14.879
you don't need to bother.

39:14.880 --> 39:16.759
My feelings are mine.

39:16.760 --> 39:19.440
I've never forced them on you.

39:21.850 --> 39:24.449
If you still feel you have to push me away,

39:24.450 --> 39:27.239
then meet and date a woman
I can acknowledge.

39:27.240 --> 39:29.950
Then, I'll be properly jealous.

39:30.420 --> 39:34.929
Don't waste precious time
and spend money uselessly like this.

39:34.930 --> 39:37.219
Calling me to be your designated driver
when you haven't even been drinking,

39:37.220 --> 39:39.200
don't do it anymore.

39:39.880 --> 39:44.970
Your parents wouldn't like you
acting like this.

39:53.910 --> 39:57.350
It was dropped on the floor at home,
under the dresser.

40:16.730 --> 40:18.823
<i>If you're doing this to push me away,</i>

40:19.180 --> 40:21.229
you don't need to bother.

40:21.230 --> 40:23.129
My feelings are mine.

40:23.130 --> 40:25.205
I've never forced them on you.

40:36.480 --> 40:38.130
Kim Na Na...

40:39.980 --> 40:41.870
Don't like me.

40:43.540 --> 40:45.600
You have to be happy.

40:48.190 --> 40:51.429
2 police officers... and Lee Kyung Wan.

40:51.430 --> 40:54.360
He killed them with one stroke of the knife
with no hesitation.

40:54.560 --> 40:55.729
He's a master butcher.

40:55.730 --> 40:58.599
There were no finger prints
in the hospital room,

40:58.600 --> 41:00.489
other than that of the medical team.

41:00.490 --> 41:03.699
The CCTV at the hospital were sprayed
so there's no video.

41:03.700 --> 41:06.109
That's the same method as when
Seo Yong Hak was targeted by the sniper.

41:06.110 --> 41:08.260
And right next to me at the time

41:08.620 --> 41:10.139
was Lee Yoon Sung.

41:10.140 --> 41:12.469
It seems there's something there.

41:12.470 --> 41:14.959
Investigator Jang Pil Jae,
start tailing Lee Yoon Sung right now.

41:14.960 --> 41:16.749
And report immediately
if there's anything strange.

41:16.750 --> 41:18.030
Yes, Sir.

41:38.690 --> 41:40.400
<i>Ahjumeoni.</i>

41:41.590 --> 41:45.889
Oh, come and sit.

41:45.890 --> 41:48.279
I was passing by and the melons looked good
so I bought some.

41:48.280 --> 41:49.879
It was only 5000 won for this much.

41:49.880 --> 41:51.600
Please keep and eat it.

41:52.060 --> 41:55.609
How can I eat all this?
I'm alone, you know.

41:55.610 --> 41:57.199
You take some too.

41:57.200 --> 41:59.330
I'm alone now too...

42:01.040 --> 42:03.289
You know my father is in the hospital.

42:03.290 --> 42:06.410
Your father must wake up.

42:06.480 --> 42:08.740
It has already been 10 years.

42:10.790 --> 42:12.859
But, Ahjumeoni...

42:12.860 --> 42:15.760
Do you really have no family?

42:15.990 --> 42:17.960
No children?

42:18.610 --> 42:23.600
Oh... I told you I don't.

42:24.140 --> 42:26.139
Ah, Na Na, what would you like to eat?

42:26.140 --> 42:27.720
Ddeokbuki?

42:27.850 --> 42:30.439
I'll make it for you.
Wait just a bit.

42:30.440 --> 42:31.760
Okay.

42:35.880 --> 42:37.520
Ahjumeoni!

42:38.290 --> 42:41.100
Ahjumeoni, Ahjumeoni!

42:41.330 --> 42:42.549
What do I do?

42:42.550 --> 42:44.630
Ahjumeoni, are you all right?

42:48.090 --> 42:49.629
You know Myung Mun Foundation?

42:49.630 --> 42:51.069
- Yeah?
- Last year...

42:51.070 --> 42:55.040
they shot the entire school operating
capital into some fund and lost half of it.

42:56.060 --> 42:56.909
The school?

42:56.910 --> 42:59.279
To deal with that,
they reduced scholarships.

42:59.280 --> 43:01.279
And to reduce scholarships,
they changed regulations.

43:01.280 --> 43:02.789
This was some mess.

43:02.790 --> 43:05.100
Isn't this school audited?

43:07.900 --> 43:08.769
A call's coming in.

43:08.820 --> 43:10.529
[Kim Na Na]

43:10.580 --> 43:12.589
It's Na Na.
Answer it.

43:12.590 --> 43:14.380
I don't need to answer it.

43:17.990 --> 43:21.930
Answer it!
Something might have happened to Na Na.

43:26.570 --> 43:27.469
Hello?

43:27.470 --> 43:31.330
Lee Yoon Sung,
Madis ahjumeoni has collapsed.

43:31.520 --> 43:34.960
I'm at the Seoul Hospital emergency room.
Come quickly.

43:35.010 --> 43:36.539
Why should I?

43:36.540 --> 43:39.950
Because she's your mother.

44:02.190 --> 44:03.646
Aish! Seriously...

44:35.290 --> 44:37.970
Oh?
Lee Yoon Sung.

44:41.610 --> 44:43.589
He has come, her guardian.

44:43.590 --> 44:44.759
Who's a guardian?

44:44.760 --> 44:46.639
- He's her son.
- Hey.

44:46.640 --> 44:50.900
Patient Lee Kyung Hee's test results
have come out.

44:50.990 --> 44:53.760
It's myelogenous leukemia.

44:54.300 --> 44:57.509
I told her she had to be admitted,
but she left anyway.

44:57.510 --> 45:00.270
Now, her condition has worsened a lot.

45:00.330 --> 45:02.949
She will need chemotherapy right away.

45:02.950 --> 45:06.069
And since the chances of matching
bone marrow are higher in family members,

45:06.070 --> 45:09.300
please tell her family to be tested.

45:27.340 --> 45:30.880
Ahjumeoni has no family.

45:32.070 --> 45:34.840
I don't know what the situation is,

45:35.630 --> 45:38.099
but you're her son.

45:38.100 --> 45:39.709
Get tested.

45:39.710 --> 45:41.500
Why should I?!

45:44.110 --> 45:48.400
Didn't she abandon me?
Now she needs a bone marrow match son?

45:49.810 --> 45:54.650
Ahjumeoni abandoned you?

45:55.910 --> 45:59.010
Is that why you said you had no mother?

46:06.220 --> 46:09.069
Still, you longed to see her.

46:09.070 --> 46:11.679
That's why you held onto that picture.

46:11.680 --> 46:13.499
If you hate her, say you hate her.

46:13.600 --> 46:15.159
If you resent her, say you resent her.

46:15.260 --> 46:17.359
If you miss her, say you miss her.

46:17.360 --> 46:19.110
Tell her.

46:20.290 --> 46:25.110
You have a mother to say those things to.

46:28.570 --> 46:31.879
Well, if you really don't want to,

46:31.880 --> 46:33.779
you can just watch her die.

46:33.780 --> 46:35.080
What?

46:36.690 --> 46:38.590
You know you can't.

46:38.680 --> 46:43.470
So, let's hurry and fill out the paperwork
and get her treated. Okay?

46:52.850 --> 46:56.070
Put her in a private room,
the best available.

47:06.140 --> 47:08.000
Yes, it's me, Prosecutor.

47:14.850 --> 47:16.480
It's me.

47:16.570 --> 47:22.050
Lee Yoon Sung is checking on a woman
named Lee Kyung Hee.

47:22.110 --> 47:23.149
What?

47:23.150 --> 47:24.960
Lee Kyung Hee?

47:25.270 --> 47:26.629
What, leukemia?

47:26.630 --> 47:30.380
Kim Young Joo has smelled something.

47:30.450 --> 47:33.209
His investigator has been following.

47:33.210 --> 47:37.250
It's suspicious that he would register
a woman he has no connection to.

47:39.110 --> 47:41.079
But, if she's possibly family...

47:41.080 --> 47:42.990
Since it's leukemia...

47:43.910 --> 47:45.609
Wouldn't he get a blood test?

47:45.610 --> 47:47.890
Soft-hearted Punk...

47:48.170 --> 47:51.999
Yoon Sung may think of trying to save her
himself and get a blood test.

47:52.000 --> 47:53.009
Stop him, no matter what.

47:53.010 --> 47:54.739
Get his blood, no matter what.

47:54.740 --> 47:56.260
No matter what!

48:00.510 --> 48:02.480
He must be stopped.

48:03.160 --> 48:04.829
This is the best opportunity.

48:04.830 --> 48:08.779
I'm not in a financial position
to stay at the hospital and get treated.

48:08.780 --> 48:10.739
You know that.

48:10.740 --> 48:12.960
Let's think about this.

48:14.010 --> 48:15.679
If you think about it,

48:15.680 --> 48:18.110
then does your financial position change?

48:21.710 --> 48:24.819
Speak gently, would you?
She's sick.

48:24.820 --> 48:28.469
I don't want to trouble anyone.

48:28.470 --> 48:30.680
Then, be healthy.

48:30.790 --> 48:33.560
If you collapse again
and get carted in again by someone else,

48:33.690 --> 48:35.620
isn't that being a nuisance?

48:37.760 --> 48:40.689
I understand you have no family.
So, why don't you just listen.

48:40.690 --> 48:42.689
Lee Yoon Sung!

48:42.690 --> 48:44.569
If we just let you go home,

48:44.570 --> 48:46.900
do you think our consciences
would be at ease?

48:47.570 --> 48:51.320
Just stay in the hospital and get treated.

49:08.540 --> 49:10.769
Lee Yoon Sung might speak in that manner,

49:10.770 --> 49:13.010
but he's not a bad person.

49:14.200 --> 49:18.460
That young doctor's name is Lee Yoon Sung?

49:18.580 --> 49:19.900
Yes.

49:41.680 --> 49:43.360
Aish!

49:45.190 --> 49:46.540
Yoon Sung.

49:47.920 --> 49:50.160
Calm down.

49:50.510 --> 49:52.209
Does this make any sense?

49:52.210 --> 49:54.809
Didn't she abandon me
so she could have a good life on her own?

49:54.810 --> 49:57.230
Then she should be living well!

49:57.380 --> 49:59.229
But why is she sick?!

49:59.230 --> 50:00.849
Why is she sick in front of me?!

50:00.850 --> 50:02.439
Right, right, you're right.

50:02.440 --> 50:04.969
Cry, cry.
Shout, shout, shout.

50:04.970 --> 50:06.730
She's really bad.

50:07.900 --> 50:09.850
She's a bad person.

50:10.580 --> 50:12.530
Oh, my...

50:18.370 --> 50:20.760
<i>The patient has no family?</i>

50:20.950 --> 50:22.840
Aren't you her son?

50:23.170 --> 50:26.130
I'm not.
There was a misunderstanding.

50:26.210 --> 50:28.959
Oh, then this is a big problem.

50:28.960 --> 50:33.740
Patient Lee Kyung Hee needs chemotherapy
and a bone marrow transplant.

50:33.780 --> 50:37.890
Since she has no family,
we have no choice but to find a donor match.

50:38.440 --> 50:41.869
If you can't find one, then what happens?

50:41.870 --> 50:43.399
In the worst case,

50:43.400 --> 50:47.850
the patient can die,
waiting for a bone marrow match.

50:48.010 --> 50:51.420
The patient's condition is bad,
so it's urgent.

50:51.580 --> 50:52.980
Then...

50:54.430 --> 50:56.639
Could I possibly be a donor?

50:56.640 --> 50:59.289
Even outside the family,
if your bone marrow matches...

50:59.290 --> 51:04.050
For now, let's do a simple blood test
to see if your genes are compatible.

51:04.070 --> 51:05.339
A blood test?

51:05.510 --> 51:09.360
[Treatment Room]

51:09.400 --> 51:12.689
The lab for blood draws
is just around the corner.

51:12.690 --> 51:13.970
Okay.

51:36.220 --> 51:37.520
The boss...

51:38.090 --> 51:39.600
What do I do?

51:39.630 --> 51:42.230
So, you're going to get a blood test.

51:43.080 --> 51:44.229
Even though she abandoned you,

51:44.230 --> 51:47.329
now that your mother has leukemia,
have you gotten soft-hearted?

51:47.360 --> 51:49.329
Are you intending to be a bone marrow donor?

51:49.330 --> 51:51.029
If it's necessary,
there's no reason I couldn't.

51:51.030 --> 51:52.619
Says who?!

51:52.620 --> 51:56.139
Until the revenge is complete, not a
hair on your head nor a drop of your blood

51:56.140 --> 51:58.759
is up to you to use without my permission.

51:58.760 --> 52:00.629
Even if she's a mother who abandoned me,

52:00.630 --> 52:02.580
a mother is a mother.

52:03.240 --> 52:04.839
If she dies like this,

52:04.840 --> 52:07.030
I can't even hate her as much as I want.

52:07.690 --> 52:10.810
So, you'll save her so you can hate her.

52:12.580 --> 52:14.649
The moment you give your blood,

52:14.650 --> 52:16.829
your identity will be exposed.

52:16.830 --> 52:18.619
Then our revenge is over.

52:18.620 --> 52:20.909
It's just a blood test.

52:20.910 --> 52:22.699
How would my identity be exposed?

52:22.700 --> 52:24.899
Are you saying you didn't know that

52:24.900 --> 52:27.299
Prosecutor Kim Young Joo has been
tailing you?

52:27.300 --> 52:30.630
The investigator even followed you
to the hospital.

52:34.070 --> 52:35.380
Huh?

52:37.480 --> 52:39.699
Is anyone there?
Please open the door.

52:39.700 --> 52:40.849
Huh?

52:40.850 --> 52:42.249
<i>Isn't anyone there?</i>

52:42.250 --> 52:44.009
Huh?
This isn't good.

52:44.010 --> 52:46.270
Oh!
Hello?

52:49.360 --> 52:51.930
[Cleaning in Progress]

52:54.360 --> 52:56.999
Prosecutor Kim Young Joo
has followed you here.

52:57.000 --> 53:00.650
Do you think he won't be able to figure out
that Lee Kyung Hee is your mother?

53:01.100 --> 53:04.290
Yet, you still want to save your mother?

53:06.400 --> 53:08.210
I'm warning you.

53:08.220 --> 53:10.050
Your life...

53:10.460 --> 53:13.160
depends on your decision.

53:32.370 --> 53:33.929
Yoon Sung, Yoon Sung.

53:33.930 --> 53:35.259
The boss was here, wasn't he?

53:35.260 --> 53:36.620
What did he say?

53:36.860 --> 53:38.319
He said not to get a blood test.

53:38.320 --> 53:42.389
Right...
Are you going to?

53:42.390 --> 53:44.409
They could find a match even without you.

53:44.410 --> 53:46.589
They said if they can't find one right away,
she'll die.

53:46.590 --> 53:50.499
Still, you can't die because of this!

53:50.500 --> 53:52.010
It's all right.

53:54.030 --> 53:56.260
The boss told you no, didn't he?

54:39.880 --> 54:41.570
<i>Where is he?</i>

54:47.100 --> 54:47.939
Prosecutor.

54:47.940 --> 54:49.149
What in the world happened?

54:49.150 --> 54:50.609
What about Lee Yoon Sung?

54:50.610 --> 54:52.250
I don't know.

55:23.960 --> 55:26.949
Someone might misunderstand
and think that you like me.

55:26.950 --> 55:28.579
You can put away that worry.

55:28.580 --> 55:30.379
I'm completely healthy.

55:30.380 --> 55:33.189
Then, shouldn't you take a number and wait?

55:33.190 --> 55:35.119
There are lots of people waiting for me.

55:35.120 --> 55:39.110
Ah...
What I need is your blood.

55:39.410 --> 55:40.689
Ah...

55:40.690 --> 55:42.979
Are you playing vampire this time?

55:42.980 --> 55:45.300
That sounds like a lot of fun.

55:46.100 --> 55:47.799
Excuse me.

55:47.800 --> 55:49.889
I'm Prosecutor Kim Young Joo from
the Seoul Special Investigations Bureau.

55:49.890 --> 55:51.869
I have a letter requesting cooperation.

55:51.870 --> 55:53.979
The blood you just drew from Lee Yoon Sung,

55:53.980 --> 55:56.129
could you release it to us, please?

55:56.130 --> 55:58.000
Just a moment.

55:58.350 --> 56:00.410
Would that be okay?

56:01.590 --> 56:03.400
Of course.

56:08.180 --> 56:09.700
Thank you.

56:17.190 --> 56:19.829
I'm going to take this to the NFS*
(*National Forensic Service).

56:19.830 --> 56:21.109
You tail Lee Yoon Sung.

56:21.110 --> 56:22.600
All right.

56:45.770 --> 56:47.200
Oh, my gosh!

56:47.820 --> 56:49.629
Investigator Jang Pil Jae.

56:49.630 --> 56:51.199
What are you doing here?

56:51.200 --> 56:52.619
Hello!

56:52.620 --> 56:54.129
Where's Prosecutor Kim Young Joo?

56:54.130 --> 56:56.100
Ah, well...

56:56.380 --> 57:00.759
I asked him to look into a re-investigation,
and I found the witness.

57:00.760 --> 57:01.509
Later, I'll...

57:01.510 --> 57:04.379
Oh! Can't you just give me
his phone number?

57:04.380 --> 57:05.579
I'm a little busy.
Later, I'll...

57:05.580 --> 57:09.620
This is really important to me.
Please, please.

57:10.080 --> 57:11.980
You're going to tell me, right?

57:12.280 --> 57:14.400
Investigator Jang Pil Jae...

57:19.150 --> 57:20.790
What is it, Investigator Jang?

57:21.190 --> 57:22.139
What?

57:22.140 --> 57:23.930
You lost Lee Yoon Sung?

57:24.070 --> 57:25.499
Just in case,

57:25.500 --> 57:27.980
send more officers to the NFS.

58:07.960 --> 58:10.740
A person has died.

58:10.850 --> 58:16.803
<i>We have to determine
if it's suicide or homicide.</i>

58:41.090 --> 58:44.370
- Oh!
- Why is he so heavy?

59:05.780 --> 59:07.670
One, two...

59:08.030 --> 59:10.570
Oh, he's heavy.

59:10.880 --> 59:13.270
One, two, that's it.

59:46.410 --> 59:50.089
So, do they think we're idle here?

59:50.090 --> 59:52.649
Are we the Public Prosecutor's on-call team?

59:52.650 --> 59:54.639
We have mountains of blood to examine.

59:54.640 --> 59:56.099
If they bring us this one measly vile,

59:56.100 --> 59:57.949
and ask us to compare it
with that last sample,

59:57.950 --> 59:59.549
does the answer come out instantly?!

59:59.550 --> 01:00:01.349
That prosecutor, I'm going to...

01:00:01.350 --> 01:00:03.539
Sunbaenim*, please hold back.
(*senior)

01:00:03.540 --> 01:00:06.889
Let's bear it and just get it done.

01:00:06.890 --> 01:00:09.659
No!
We're no scabs.

01:00:09.660 --> 01:00:11.579
I'm going to teach them a lesson.

01:00:11.580 --> 01:00:12.940
Move!

01:00:13.990 --> 01:00:16.560
Who's Prosecutor Kim Young Joo?!

01:00:17.070 --> 01:00:18.479
Ah, yes.

01:00:18.480 --> 01:00:19.980
That's me.

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.429
Prosecutor Kim Young Joo?

01:00:24.430 --> 01:00:28.889
I'm sorry. It's such an urgent case
that I had to come suddenly.

01:00:28.890 --> 01:00:32.710
It must have been urgent for you
to come directly yourself.

01:00:33.320 --> 01:00:36.199
As soon as possible?

01:00:36.400 --> 01:00:37.959
As soon as possible?

01:00:37.960 --> 01:00:40.150
Yes, please.

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:43.599
We'll put everything else aside
and examine it for you.

01:00:43.600 --> 01:00:45.019
I'll wait here.

01:00:45.020 --> 01:00:47.600
Then wait just a little bit.

01:01:23.640 --> 01:01:25.360
Oh...

01:01:25.400 --> 01:01:28.109
Oh my, oh my. Oh, my goodness...

01:01:28.110 --> 01:01:30.330
He's exactly my type.

01:01:30.810 --> 01:01:32.910
Have you seen such a pretty prosecutor?

01:01:33.390 --> 01:01:37.680
Such shining eyes, that statuesque face...

01:01:38.570 --> 01:01:43.039
A body with not an ounce of fat,
like a statue of David...

01:01:43.040 --> 01:01:45.260
Oh, I swear!

01:01:45.340 --> 01:01:46.750
Ah!

01:01:47.830 --> 01:01:49.609
As soon as we finish
what we have in process,

01:01:49.610 --> 01:01:52.199
let's do the pretty prosecutor's job. Hmm?

01:01:52.200 --> 01:01:54.729
Oh...!
I swear!

01:01:54.730 --> 01:01:55.819
The analysis is done here.

01:01:55.820 --> 01:01:56.709
We can put that in now.

01:01:56.710 --> 01:01:59.480
Oh, all right.
I'll bring it over.

01:02:01.760 --> 01:02:03.509
Is it still going to be long?

01:02:03.510 --> 01:02:05.799
Oh, you must be bored waiting.

01:02:05.800 --> 01:02:07.549
Would you like to get some coffee with me?

01:02:07.550 --> 01:02:08.669
Could I?

01:02:08.670 --> 01:02:10.710
Yes.
Let me just put this in first.
