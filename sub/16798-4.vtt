00:58.081 --> 01:00.524
This morning's bombing in Rome

01:00.525 --> 01:02.592
is more than just a brutal attack

01:02.593 --> 01:05.361
on one of the most beautiful
cities in the world.

01:05.363 --> 01:06.963
This is a threat which will be answered.

01:08.165 --> 01:09.766
Governor, Governor, you've
said that as president,

01:09.767 --> 01:11.911
you would increase surveillance
of Muslim Americans...

01:11.912 --> 01:12.625
Whoa, whoa.

01:12.626 --> 01:14.982
First of all, no group has
claimed responsibility yet

01:14.983 --> 01:16.049
for the bombing

01:16.050 --> 01:17.984
at Stazione Triumfale in Rome.

01:17.985 --> 01:20.787
And I would never suggest
infringing on the rights

01:20.788 --> 01:22.571
- of America citizens, ever.
- Yeah?

01:22.572 --> 01:24.291
He doesn't suggest it.

01:24.292 --> 01:25.692
He wants to legislate it.

01:25.693 --> 01:28.061
But if an attack does occur...

01:28.062 --> 01:29.429
Nice suit, though.

01:29.430 --> 01:31.598
His staff's definitely working overtime.

01:31.599 --> 01:33.433
They've pulled him
off the campaign trail

01:33.434 --> 01:34.834
so he can keep running around

01:34.835 --> 01:37.536
showing off his new global concern.

01:38.505 --> 01:41.541
No mention of the bombing
in Angola, I notice.

01:41.542 --> 01:43.977
Twice as many dead as in Rome.

01:43.978 --> 01:46.079
But if the press doesn't mention it,

01:46.080 --> 01:47.514
why should he?

01:49.884 --> 01:51.351
Of course, this means that I have

01:51.352 --> 01:54.154
to pull Conrad off the trail, too.

01:54.155 --> 01:56.790
Right after that China
speech last week got us

01:56.791 --> 01:58.158
a two point bump in the polls.

01:58.159 --> 02:00.460
But we still have an election

02:00.461 --> 02:02.195
to pull out of thin air.

02:02.196 --> 02:03.997
I thought it was...

02:03.998 --> 02:07.567
less than a total long
shot, which... I took

02:07.568 --> 02:11.104
to be boundless
optimism coming from you.

02:11.105 --> 02:13.940
New York Times is about to endorse us,

02:13.941 --> 02:15.742
which should reassure the centrists.

02:15.743 --> 02:18.978
And we are making progress
getting those sore loser laws

02:18.979 --> 02:20.313
changed to get him

02:20.314 --> 02:22.649
on the ballot in the states
we missed in the primaries.

02:22.650 --> 02:24.951
I'm sensing an Eeyore footnote.

02:24.952 --> 02:26.953
Minnesota and Ohio

02:26.954 --> 02:28.121
are holdouts.

02:28.122 --> 02:30.824
If we don't get Dalton on
the ballot in those two,

02:30.825 --> 02:33.660
we have no hope of
keeping Evans or Reynolds

02:33.661 --> 02:35.695
from getting to 270, at which point,

02:35.696 --> 02:37.197
it's game over.

02:37.198 --> 02:39.766
We've got the team on Minnesota,

02:39.767 --> 02:41.501
but I need your help.

02:41.502 --> 02:43.543
- I can't campaign, you know...
- With Ohio, it's...

02:43.544 --> 02:45.247
- I can't campaign!
- it's not campaigning!

02:45.248 --> 02:47.307
We-we just need somebody high profile

02:47.308 --> 02:49.676
to take Dalton's place in
an NFL pre-game interview.

02:49.677 --> 02:53.146
Slip in something about
getting on the ballot,

02:53.147 --> 02:55.782
and go have dinner with
some state senators.

02:55.783 --> 02:58.718
How is wining and dining state senators

02:58.719 --> 03:01.340
- not campaigning?
- Because I have a room full of lawyers,

03:01.341 --> 03:02.989
telling me that isn't!

03:02.990 --> 03:04.691
We are in this

03:04.692 --> 03:07.227
ridiculous situation 'cause of your idea

03:07.228 --> 03:09.295
to turn our backs on the party

03:09.296 --> 03:11.597
and do an independent run.

03:22.976 --> 03:25.278
Be right back.

03:25.279 --> 03:26.982
Assistant Secretary
Thompson, I am so sorry

03:26.983 --> 03:29.349
I didn't reach you before
you came all the way up here.

03:29.350 --> 03:32.085
The attack in Rome
has completely hijacked

03:32.086 --> 03:33.620
her schedule...

03:33.621 --> 03:35.288
That was an unfortunate verb choice.

03:35.289 --> 03:36.185
She's not in?

03:36.186 --> 03:37.786
Emergency conference at the White House.

03:37.810 --> 03:39.626
But I will give that

03:39.627 --> 03:41.995
- to her as soon as she returns.
- Excuse me.

03:41.996 --> 03:43.830
Hi, Louise, what are we cancelling?

03:43.831 --> 03:46.565
Yeah, that should be fine, um...

03:47.700 --> 03:50.402
...Yes.

03:52.138 --> 03:53.939
I'll have to double-check that.

03:57.210 --> 03:58.878
Death toll now at 42,

03:58.879 --> 04:00.547
with more injured in
a suicide bombing...

04:00.548 --> 04:03.983
Hizb Al-Shahid just took
credit for the bombing in Rome.

04:03.984 --> 04:06.386
I heard. Do we believe it?

04:06.387 --> 04:08.455
Well, the sources seem credible.

04:08.456 --> 04:11.224
So, now they're moving
from Algeria into Europe.

04:11.225 --> 04:13.259
DEA came through with some Intel

04:13.260 --> 04:15.068
on sales of antiquities
from North Africa.

04:15.069 --> 04:16.870
See if any of these look
like they were looted

04:16.870 --> 04:18.014
from St. Gabriel's Monastery

04:18.015 --> 04:19.065
before HS blew it up.

04:19.065 --> 04:22.067
Stones from the tomb of the
Christian woman in Tipaza.

04:22.069 --> 04:23.603
Not too far from the monastery.

04:23.604 --> 04:25.505
Stones, though; very hard
to prove authenticity.

04:25.506 --> 04:26.906
What's this one?

04:26.907 --> 04:30.844
"Reliquary of St. Augustine
from the Basilica in Annaba"

04:30.845 --> 04:32.612
Looks like St. Augustine
has the same taste

04:32.613 --> 04:34.013
as a Corsican drug lord.

04:34.014 --> 04:34.881
Trust me,

04:34.882 --> 04:36.783
this is not St. Augustine style.

04:36.784 --> 04:38.818
This is the Colonial
French feeling guilty.

04:38.819 --> 04:40.753
See, when France took over Algeria,

04:40.754 --> 04:42.922
they felt bad because none
of Augustine's remains were

04:42.923 --> 04:45.381
in Annaba, his hometown,
so they made this reliquary

04:45.382 --> 04:47.861
to return his arm bone to the basilica.

04:47.862 --> 04:49.162
Where's Annaba?

04:49.163 --> 04:51.664
Northeastern Algeria.

04:51.665 --> 04:55.134
Part of the ancient
city of Hippo Regius.

04:55.135 --> 04:56.970
Maybe HS sacked that place, too?

04:56.971 --> 04:58.972
There's plenty there worth looting.

04:58.973 --> 05:01.708
But I didn't think they'd
gotten that far north.

05:01.709 --> 05:04.878
Just like we didn't
think they were in Rome.

05:04.879 --> 05:06.045
Let's check with DEA.

05:06.046 --> 05:07.980
See if we can trace
this back to the seller.

05:08.397 --> 05:09.448
Susan.

05:10.683 --> 05:12.751
I'm sorry to disrupt your
schedule, Madam Secretary.

05:12.752 --> 05:13.553
N-No, no, no.

05:13.554 --> 05:15.221
I'm-I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

05:15.222 --> 05:18.391
The...fallout from Rome

05:18.392 --> 05:21.194
has been getting all the attention.

05:21.195 --> 05:23.229
- You know how that goes.
- I do.

05:23.230 --> 05:25.698
So...

05:25.699 --> 05:28.701
The bombing in Luanda,
that was a travesty.

05:28.702 --> 05:30.403
How's Kalanga?

05:30.404 --> 05:33.339
She's injured, but alive, thank God.

05:33.340 --> 05:35.475
A separatist group is taking credit.

05:35.476 --> 05:37.277
I-I'm really sorry

05:37.278 --> 05:39.045
that I haven't been able to respond,

05:39.046 --> 05:42.615
but I'll issue a
statement condemning the...

05:42.616 --> 05:46.252
the group's actions in
the... strongest terms.

05:46.253 --> 05:49.455
With all respect, Madam
Secretary, the situation

05:49.456 --> 05:52.792
in Angola has gone well beyond
a statement of condemnation.

05:52.793 --> 05:54.926
Which is why I'm here.

05:57.664 --> 05:59.132
A memo of dissent?

05:59.133 --> 06:02.302
Signed by your entire
African Affairs Bureau.

06:02.303 --> 06:03.937
Specifically objecting

06:03.938 --> 06:05.338
to our policies in Angola.

06:05.339 --> 06:08.007
For 30 years, President
Bestilo has enjoyed

06:08.008 --> 06:10.777
generous trade agreements
with the United States,

06:10.778 --> 06:12.245
a wealth of subsidies,

06:12.246 --> 06:14.614
and a blind eye to his
increasing corruption

06:14.615 --> 06:16.282
- and cronyism.
- Are you suggesting

06:16.283 --> 06:18.384
that President Bestilo
was behind the attack?

06:18.385 --> 06:20.119
I'm saying that this administration's

06:20.120 --> 06:22.155
deafening silence after an attack

06:22.156 --> 06:25.258
that killed twice as many
people as that bombing in Rome...

06:25.259 --> 06:26.659
It's just the latest example

06:26.660 --> 06:27.760
of ongoing indifference.

06:27.761 --> 06:29.662
So, dissent memo?

06:29.663 --> 06:32.432
Bestilo put a ban on all
public assembly this morning,

06:32.433 --> 06:33.933
supposedly to protect the people.

06:33.934 --> 06:36.769
But it is obvious he's
using this bombing as a cover

06:36.770 --> 06:38.071
to silence his opponent.

06:38.072 --> 06:41.074
The people want Kalanga and he knows it.

06:41.075 --> 06:42.675
He's stealing this election.

06:42.676 --> 06:44.844
I can't ask my staff
to stand by silently

06:44.845 --> 06:46.879
while the administration does nothing.

06:46.880 --> 06:49.315
I will do everything in my power

06:49.316 --> 06:53.052
- to make our deep displeasure known.
- No.

06:53.053 --> 06:54.821
Not another "urge,

06:54.822 --> 06:56.623
encourage, concern" phone call.

06:56.624 --> 06:59.292
This needs action, Elizabeth.

06:59.293 --> 07:01.160
If Bestilo is allowed to snuff out

07:01.161 --> 07:03.129
a once-in-a-generation candidate,

07:03.130 --> 07:04.430
and the rest of the world shrugs

07:04.431 --> 07:07.367
'cause nobody went to
Luanda on a honeymoon,

07:07.368 --> 07:10.368
that's an African story
I'm tired of telling.

07:12.038 --> 07:13.172
We've got some

07:13.173 --> 07:16.275
changes to note in the
secretary's schedule.

07:16.276 --> 07:19.512
The Emissions and
Deforestation Conference

07:19.513 --> 07:21.180
will be postponed.

07:21.181 --> 07:23.016
Thank you. And we've added

07:23.017 --> 07:25.251
the NFL Diplomacy Initiative

07:25.252 --> 07:27.387
in Cleveland, ma'am.

07:28.722 --> 07:32.191
Yeah, the... president is stepping off

07:32.192 --> 07:33.326
the campaign trail.

07:33.327 --> 07:34.427
I'm just gonna fill in.

07:34.428 --> 07:36.162
As in, campaigning?

07:36.163 --> 07:38.264
No, no. It-it's just a little...

07:38.265 --> 07:40.700
pre-game interview about...

07:40.701 --> 07:42.435
football and diplomacy.

07:42.436 --> 07:44.504
Yeah.

07:44.505 --> 07:46.606
Well, Russell Jackson
insists it's legal.

07:46.607 --> 07:47.507
Hey, wait.

07:47.508 --> 07:48.775
Who's doing the interview?

07:48.776 --> 07:49.976
James Brown.

07:50.811 --> 07:52.578
- I thought he was dead.
- No.

07:52.579 --> 07:54.213
That would be, fellow diplomat

07:54.214 --> 07:56.749
and ambassador of soul, James Brown.

07:56.750 --> 07:57.750
This would be

07:57.751 --> 08:01.120
CBS Sportscaster James Brown. J.B.!

08:01.121 --> 08:02.555
And what exactly

08:02.556 --> 08:05.892
is it that Russell Jackson
would like you to say?

08:05.893 --> 08:07.093
Legally.

08:07.094 --> 08:09.762
...I think the
non-campaigning version

08:09.763 --> 08:14.801
of "Please put President
Dalton on the ballot in Ohio."

08:14.802 --> 08:16.202
Hey! What about this?

08:16.203 --> 08:18.771
Um, Dalton's not on the ballot because

08:18.772 --> 08:20.006
of the sore loser law, right?

08:20.007 --> 08:21.741
Just recently,

08:21.742 --> 08:23.558
the NFL changed the extra point rule...

08:23.559 --> 08:24.744
Yeah, too many kickers

08:24.745 --> 08:27.113
were making it, so they moved
it back to the 15 yard line.

08:27.114 --> 08:29.482
Right, and just as the
NFL can change the rules,

08:29.483 --> 08:31.684
to make the game fair and competitive...

08:31.685 --> 08:33.885
So Ohio can reexamine its policy

08:33.886 --> 08:35.388
in this historically unprecedented

08:35.389 --> 08:36.289
third party run.

08:36.289 --> 08:37.712
- Yes!
- That's good.

08:37.714 --> 08:38.524
I like that.

08:38.525 --> 08:40.827
I like that......
G-Give more of those.

08:40.828 --> 08:42.160
Okay, moving on.

08:42.162 --> 08:46.365
Yes, sorry. We need to talk
about the bombing in Angola.

08:46.366 --> 08:47.834
It's awful.

08:47.835 --> 08:49.135
Kalanga survive?

08:49.136 --> 08:50.870
Yeah, with injuries.

08:50.871 --> 08:52.972
83 others were not as lucky.

08:52.973 --> 08:57.310
But President Bestilo
is using the attack

08:57.311 --> 08:59.912
to suppress his opponent,
and this morning,

08:59.913 --> 09:02.148
I received a dissent memo

09:02.149 --> 09:04.484
from the Bureau of African Affairs,

09:04.485 --> 09:06.853
urging a stronger response.

09:06.854 --> 09:07.954
Um, can I see it?

09:07.955 --> 09:09.856
It's an understandable

09:09.857 --> 09:12.325
frustration at our ongoing cooperation

09:12.326 --> 09:15.094
with an increasingly corrupt regime.

09:15.095 --> 09:18.264
What I need... are some possible

09:18.265 --> 09:21.868
sanctions I can threaten

09:21.869 --> 09:23.903
to get President
Bestilo to toe the line.

09:23.904 --> 09:26.305
- Cut off aide?
- Or agricultural imports.

09:26.306 --> 09:28.556
I mean, they get a ton of
poultry and grain from us.

09:28.557 --> 09:29.275
Not sure

09:29.276 --> 09:31.139
how American farmers are
gonna feel about that.

09:31.140 --> 09:33.546
Not as bad as the Angolans if
we cut off their food supply.

09:33.547 --> 09:35.981
- We'll draw up some talking points.
- Thank you.

09:37.316 --> 09:39.585
Hey!

09:39.586 --> 09:41.320
Louise said I could catch you.

09:41.321 --> 09:42.288
Um, could we just

09:42.289 --> 09:44.056
slow this down to a jog, please?

09:44.057 --> 09:45.291
We need to talk about Angola.

09:45.292 --> 09:46.359
Why?

09:46.360 --> 09:47.627
The bomb there yesterday.

09:47.628 --> 09:48.895
I don't know if you heard,

09:48.896 --> 09:50.263
more dead than in Rome.

09:50.264 --> 09:51.030
Yeah?

09:51.031 --> 09:52.365
Could you do me a favor,

09:52.366 --> 09:55.101
and just pretend to listen to me?

09:55.102 --> 09:58.271
Because I just got a dissent memo

09:58.272 --> 10:00.673
from my entire African Affairs Bureau,

10:00.674 --> 10:02.375
convinced that this administration

10:02.376 --> 10:03.676
doesn't know or care

10:03.677 --> 10:06.746
that Angola's presidential
election is being stolen

10:06.747 --> 10:08.610
- in broad daylight.
- I'm a little preoccupied

10:08.611 --> 10:10.183
with another election at the moment.

10:10.184 --> 10:11.651
Why are we still talking about this?

10:11.652 --> 10:14.720
Because I want to
remind President Bestilo

10:14.721 --> 10:16.522
that he is running a democracy.

10:16.523 --> 10:18.925
So, I would like to threaten

10:18.926 --> 10:20.626
to cut our agricultural

10:20.627 --> 10:22.728
exports and I just want to make sure

10:22.729 --> 10:25.552
that I'm not lighting
anybody's hair on fire.

10:25.553 --> 10:27.233
- Do whatever you need to do.
- Okay.

10:27.234 --> 10:28.167
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

10:28.168 --> 10:29.302
Wait, what?!

10:29.303 --> 10:31.137
You can't do that!

10:31.138 --> 10:32.238
Why?

10:32.239 --> 10:33.773
Were you not listening this morning?

10:33.774 --> 10:36.475
We have two major agricultural states...

10:36.476 --> 10:39.011
Ohio, Minnesota... where
we're fighting for our lives.

10:39.012 --> 10:41.347
Y-Y-You expect me to tell them

10:41.348 --> 10:42.715
t-t-that we're just cutting off

10:42.716 --> 10:44.744
their, what, fifth biggest importer

10:44.745 --> 10:46.285
of poultry in the world?

10:46.286 --> 10:48.721
I knew you listen to me!

10:48.722 --> 10:50.256
Give me a week to get this resolved.

10:50.257 --> 10:52.558
Then you can turn all
the screws you want.

10:52.559 --> 10:53.993
I don't have a week.

10:53.994 --> 10:55.628
The election is in four days.

10:55.629 --> 10:58.264
And if Bestilo wins another term,

10:58.265 --> 11:00.333
that's one more African nation we lose

11:00.334 --> 11:01.968
to an autocratic leader.

11:01.969 --> 11:05.004
Here's a novel idea: stick
to the Prime Directive.

11:05.005 --> 11:06.906
Let democracy take its course...

11:06.907 --> 11:08.507
without U.S. interference.

11:08.508 --> 11:09.809
Really?

11:09.810 --> 11:12.545
A Star Trek reference?

11:12.546 --> 11:17.450
I deeply appreciate your
compassion, Madam Secretary,

11:17.451 --> 11:19.552
But Angola is strong.

11:19.553 --> 11:21.320
We will endure.

11:21.321 --> 11:23.389
I'm sure you will, Mr. President.

11:23.390 --> 11:26.125
However, I am concerned that your ban

11:26.126 --> 11:27.994
on public gatherings may interfere

11:27.995 --> 11:29.595
with the democratic process.

11:29.596 --> 11:31.464
It is for the safety of my people.

11:31.465 --> 11:34.100
I refuse to make them a target again.

11:34.101 --> 11:35.604
Yes, but, Mr. President...

11:35.605 --> 11:37.837
"Damiano," please.

11:37.838 --> 11:40.006
I just want to remind you

11:40.007 --> 11:43.209
that in order to continue
our support of Angola,

11:43.210 --> 11:46.412
we need to know that you will
support the will of the people.

11:46.413 --> 11:50.116
I find these conversations so inspiring.

11:50.117 --> 11:52.418
Thank you, Madam Secretary.

11:52.419 --> 11:55.721
Good luck with your own election.

11:55.722 --> 11:59.324
It seems you're going to need it.

12:01.794 --> 12:05.731
Urge, encourage... and concern.

12:05.732 --> 12:07.066
Did I leave something out?

12:07.067 --> 12:09.634
Mollify and assuage?

12:11.604 --> 12:15.041
Are you kidding me? Who
wrote these talking points?

12:15.042 --> 12:17.777
The Browns have got way bigger problems

12:17.778 --> 12:20.746
thank finding a go-to
receiver on third down.

12:20.747 --> 12:22.748
Can I just say how adorable it is

12:22.749 --> 12:25.184
that this is the most opinionated

12:25.185 --> 12:28.955
you've been about my job in, like, ever?

12:28.956 --> 12:31.724
Well, it's better than
reading that FBI report.

12:31.725 --> 12:34.060
I mean, 58 pages to say

12:34.061 --> 12:36.462
they still can't find
whoever's hacking our house

12:36.463 --> 12:38.531
and stalking our entire family?

12:38.532 --> 12:39.932
Yes, I know, I know.

12:39.933 --> 12:42.468
On the other hand, no new incidents.

12:42.469 --> 12:46.038
See? Staying positive,
trusting the system.

12:46.039 --> 12:48.374
Well, you're doing better than I am.

12:48.375 --> 12:50.109
You have a rough day?

12:52.813 --> 12:56.882
I got a dissent memo on Angola.

12:56.883 --> 12:59.919
Is that like when a
student files an appeal

12:59.920 --> 13:01.354
'cause they don't like their grade?

13:01.355 --> 13:03.689
It's an anonymous communication channel

13:03.690 --> 13:05.491
to allow anyone at the State Department

13:05.492 --> 13:07.460
to formally oppose foreign policy

13:07.461 --> 13:08.794
they don't agree with.

13:08.795 --> 13:12.430
So... I got the bad grade.

13:13.199 --> 13:15.067
That attack in Luanda was rough.

13:15.068 --> 13:17.770
Okay, can you just tell me that

13:17.771 --> 13:20.673
I do a great job at other things.

13:20.674 --> 13:23.409
- I... Right now, I just need to hear...
- Hey, hey, hey.

13:23.410 --> 13:24.977
Come on, come on.

13:24.978 --> 13:27.279
You are the very best student

13:27.280 --> 13:30.249
in the whole State Department.

13:30.250 --> 13:31.550
And you know...

13:31.551 --> 13:34.553
what I give to my best students.

13:34.554 --> 13:35.788
- Wait...
- What?

13:35.789 --> 13:37.723
God!

13:37.724 --> 13:38.858
- No, no, no, no.
- No, no, no.

13:38.859 --> 13:40.482
It's not... It was getting weird anyway.

13:40.483 --> 13:41.761
I just wanted to tell you

13:41.762 --> 13:43.145
that Jareth is coming for a visit.

13:43.146 --> 13:45.131
Well, that's great.
When does he get here?

13:45.132 --> 13:46.999
Wednesday, actually. Kinda last-minute.

13:47.000 --> 13:49.502
Well, I'll say, but
what a great surprise.

13:49.503 --> 13:51.104
Yeah, it's... it's
okay if he stays here?

13:51.105 --> 13:52.472
- Yeah, of course.
- Yes. Sure.

13:52.473 --> 13:53.806
Okay, thank you.

13:53.807 --> 13:55.230
- Yes! I'm so excited.
- Yay.

13:55.231 --> 13:58.010
Sweetie, that's great. So are we!

14:00.580 --> 14:02.715
It's okay that he stays here, right?

14:02.716 --> 14:03.849
Of course, I love that kid.

14:03.850 --> 14:05.518
No, I mean, you know,

14:05.519 --> 14:07.186
she's got that tiny little twin bed

14:07.187 --> 14:08.587
with the girly bedspread.

14:08.588 --> 14:10.097
You think that'd be comfortable?

14:10.098 --> 14:11.651
Well, I think they'll get comfortable.

14:11.652 --> 14:13.426
Really?

14:13.427 --> 14:15.914
Well, I remember we got
pretty comfortable with your...

14:15.915 --> 14:19.298
Okay, but we didn't have
Will in the next room

14:19.299 --> 14:21.033
with a very thin wall.

14:21.034 --> 14:24.202
- God, Jason.
- Yeah.

14:26.872 --> 14:28.415
- Will you say something to her?
- Yes.

14:28.416 --> 14:30.849
- I do, I will, I'll talk to her, yeah.
- Just to be quiet.

14:31.644 --> 14:33.045
Yes, Daisy, what's up?

14:33.046 --> 14:34.480
Ma'am, I just got a heads up

14:34.481 --> 14:35.581
from a guy at the Post.

14:35.582 --> 14:37.083
They have a copy of the dissent memo,

14:37.084 --> 14:38.784
and they're about to run it.

14:38.785 --> 14:40.986
Well, that's a disaster.

14:40.987 --> 14:42.488
Did he...

14:42.489 --> 14:43.823
Did he say how he got it?

14:43.824 --> 14:45.257
I couldn't get it out of him,

14:45.258 --> 14:47.693
and it's too late to kill it... I tried.

14:47.694 --> 14:49.628
Okay, well, I want
to know who leaked it,

14:49.629 --> 14:51.132
so you do whatever you have to, okay?

14:51.133 --> 14:52.231
Yes, ma'am.

14:52.232 --> 14:53.766
And, listen, for what it's worth,

14:53.767 --> 14:55.734
the news cycle is still
on the attack in Rome.

14:55.735 --> 14:56.902
We might be okay.

14:56.903 --> 14:58.938
Thanks, Daisy.

14:58.939 --> 15:02.240
What the hell is this
about a dissent memo?

15:18.389 --> 15:20.951
Now, tell me Madam Secretary,
when are we going to see

15:20.952 --> 15:23.753
NFL football in, say, France?

15:23.754 --> 15:27.924
Well, that... that's a...
that's a tricky question.

15:27.925 --> 15:30.827
I think, every
country loves its game

15:30.828 --> 15:33.263
just as much as we love ours.

15:33.264 --> 15:35.065
And change is hard.

15:35.066 --> 15:39.002
1906, football fans were scandalized

15:39.003 --> 15:40.570
by the invention of the forward pass,

15:40.571 --> 15:41.705
and now it's a definitive

15:41.706 --> 15:43.907
signature of the game.

15:43.908 --> 15:45.675
So rules do need to evolve.

15:45.676 --> 15:47.544
Now, President Dalton is looking to make

15:47.545 --> 15:50.447
a few changed in the upcoming
election, too, isn't that right?

15:50.448 --> 15:53.483
Well, I'm... I'm happy
that you brought that up.

15:53.484 --> 15:56.052
...because as much
as President Dalton is

15:56.053 --> 15:59.322
supported and trusted
by the American people,

15:59.323 --> 16:01.858
certain rules will need
to evolve to accommodate

16:01.859 --> 16:04.294
this historic third-party run.

16:04.295 --> 16:05.862
Well, with that being said,

16:05.863 --> 16:07.166
we're gonna take a little break,

16:07.167 --> 16:09.733
but, Secretary McCord, thank you again

16:09.734 --> 16:11.398
- for taking the time.
- It's my pleasure.

16:11.399 --> 16:12.985
Go, Browns!

16:15.338 --> 16:16.722
Is that Russell Jackson?

16:16.723 --> 16:19.809
Julius! Well, look at us.

16:19.810 --> 16:22.779
Even without the
support of our key donor,

16:22.780 --> 16:24.914
we somehow manage to stay in the game.

16:24.915 --> 16:26.716
I love it when he stays in sales mode.

16:28.252 --> 16:30.320
Madam Secretary, I
wanted to introduce you

16:30.321 --> 16:31.354
to a friend of mine.

16:31.355 --> 16:33.490
Secretary McCord,
Scott Goodman, KronicDM.

16:33.491 --> 16:37.327
My son loves your messaging app.

16:37.328 --> 16:40.130
He thinks I don't know
what the name means.

16:40.131 --> 16:42.098
Mom's hip.

16:42.099 --> 16:43.733
Well, I'm glad he's hooked in.

16:43.734 --> 16:45.669
I was wondering, could I grab a minute?

16:45.670 --> 16:47.971
Sure.

16:47.972 --> 16:50.273
How's it going with Sam Evans?

16:50.274 --> 16:51.374
You ready to admit

16:51.375 --> 16:53.743
you backed the wrong horse?

16:53.744 --> 16:56.178
Let's just say I haven't
placed any bets yet.

16:57.380 --> 16:59.549
I saw that story about your staff

16:59.550 --> 17:01.418
throwing a flags on the play in Africa.

17:01.419 --> 17:03.353
The dissent memo, yes.

17:03.354 --> 17:06.056
Yeah, I gotta tell you,
from a tech point of view,

17:06.057 --> 17:07.790
we're pretty frustrated, too.

17:07.791 --> 17:09.159
We're trying to get KronicDM going

17:09.160 --> 17:10.160
in Southern Africa,

17:10.161 --> 17:12.561
but these countries are killing us

17:12.563 --> 17:14.097
with these OTT taxes.

17:14.098 --> 17:16.866
A fee to use their
telecom services, right?

17:16.867 --> 17:18.702
- Over-the-top tax?
- Yes, even the name...

17:18.703 --> 17:19.903
"over-the-top"

17:19.904 --> 17:21.304
Most Africans aren't online.

17:21.305 --> 17:22.528
They just... they have phones.

17:22.529 --> 17:24.307
So we're how they're staying connected,

17:24.308 --> 17:27.277
but these state-owned telecom services

17:27.278 --> 17:29.546
are strangling us with these fees.

17:29.547 --> 17:33.249
To be fair, your app is

17:33.250 --> 17:35.618
using their services, right?

17:35.619 --> 17:37.387
So shouldn't they ask
you to help pay for it?

17:37.388 --> 17:39.155
Come on, Secretary.

17:39.156 --> 17:41.358
I mean, they could privatize telecom,

17:41.359 --> 17:42.822
and the whole economy would benefit.

17:42.823 --> 17:44.527
But then they wouldn't
be able to monitor

17:44.528 --> 17:46.296
everything that their
citizens are saying,

17:46.297 --> 17:47.831
or turn it off whenever they want to.

17:47.832 --> 17:49.532
I mean, state-owned telecom, it's bad

17:49.533 --> 17:51.368
for democracy, and
it's bad for business.

17:51.369 --> 17:54.604
I understand your frustration,

17:54.605 --> 17:57.140
but the thing about
emerging economies, Scott,

17:57.141 --> 17:58.441
is that they have to be allowed

17:58.442 --> 18:01.277
to do just that... emerge.

18:01.278 --> 18:03.146
It's... it's a process.

18:03.147 --> 18:04.914
If I wanted to, right now,

18:04.915 --> 18:06.816
I could cut a deal with one country

18:06.817 --> 18:08.151
and piggyback one network

18:08.152 --> 18:10.186
across most of Southern Africa for free,

18:10.187 --> 18:11.070
the way it should be.

18:11.071 --> 18:13.385
But I'm not doing that
'cause I'm hoping my elected

18:13.386 --> 18:15.346
- officials are gonna do their job...
- Appointed.

18:15.347 --> 18:17.290
I'm afraid that's all the
time the secretary has.

18:17.291 --> 18:19.598
Gosh, Scott, too
bad. Thanks so much.

18:22.365 --> 18:25.135
I haven't been mansplained that hard

18:25.136 --> 18:27.337
since Craig Sterling was in office.

18:27.338 --> 18:29.005
Good job on the interview.

18:29.006 --> 18:30.473
Too bad it won't save us.

18:30.474 --> 18:31.608
What do you mean?

18:31.609 --> 18:33.710
We just got word the
Times is holding back

18:33.711 --> 18:35.078
on the endorsement.

18:35.079 --> 18:36.546
They want to let this dissent memo

18:36.547 --> 18:38.348
play out first.

18:38.349 --> 18:41.884
Just long enough so it
won't do us any good.

18:44.821 --> 18:46.790
Hey, you want some of this?

18:46.791 --> 18:48.591
I don't even know what it is.

18:48.592 --> 18:50.927
- It's mushroom soufflÃ©.
- Don't you want to heat that up?

18:50.928 --> 18:54.596
No, I'm barely tasting it anyway.

18:55.865 --> 18:58.768
So, Jareth tomorrow. That's exciting.

18:58.769 --> 19:01.137
Yep.

19:01.138 --> 19:03.740
You know, Dad and I are really happy

19:03.741 --> 19:05.074
that he's gonna stay with us,

19:05.075 --> 19:08.745
but maybe we should just
talk about one thing.

19:08.746 --> 19:10.347
What, the fact that
if we move to England

19:10.348 --> 19:11.615
I might end up killing myself?

19:11.616 --> 19:14.049
What?

19:14.884 --> 19:15.885
Yeah.

19:15.886 --> 19:17.854
Sweetheart...

19:17.855 --> 19:20.422
what happened?

19:22.058 --> 19:23.526
The whole summer was awful.

19:23.527 --> 19:27.397
His friends, his family.

19:27.398 --> 19:29.032
The stupid weather.

19:29.033 --> 19:31.801
Wait, you-you've been
home almost a month.

19:31.802 --> 19:33.769
Why didn't you say something?

19:34.504 --> 19:35.839
Denial?

19:35.840 --> 19:37.273
I don't know.

19:37.274 --> 19:39.375
It was embarrassing. I mean...

19:39.376 --> 19:41.211
- you guys were so happy for me.
- Well...

19:41.212 --> 19:45.248
And it was supposed to be
the best summer of my life.

19:45.249 --> 19:48.284
Instead, I turned into this total baby.

19:48.285 --> 19:51.020
Leaving dinner parties
to go cry in the bathroom.

19:51.021 --> 19:54.824
Well, a little culture
shock is to be expected.

19:54.825 --> 19:57.126
It was more like culture electrocution.

19:57.127 --> 20:00.763
Well, how's Jareth?

20:00.764 --> 20:01.865
That was the worst part.

20:01.866 --> 20:05.935
He was kind of a totally
different person, too.

20:05.936 --> 20:08.738
I mean, like snobby,

20:08.739 --> 20:12.609
and he cared what
school everybody went to.

20:12.610 --> 20:14.043
He was, like, turning away from me

20:14.044 --> 20:15.345
if I made the wrong joke.

20:15.346 --> 20:18.047
Sounds like you guys definitely have

20:18.048 --> 20:19.182
some stuff to talk about.

20:19.183 --> 20:21.851
I don't want you to
think he's a bad person.

20:21.852 --> 20:25.088
He's just...

20:25.089 --> 20:27.724
British, it turns out.

20:27.725 --> 20:30.293
Now, but, Stevie, you have
to be straight with him.

20:30.294 --> 20:32.896
You can't pretend you're
fine when you're not.

20:32.897 --> 20:34.330
That's not how marriage works.

20:34.331 --> 20:36.799
I know.

20:36.800 --> 20:41.336
I just... I don't know
how he's gonna take it.

20:48.478 --> 20:50.513
All right, here's the part

20:50.514 --> 20:53.716
of the DEA surveillance footage we need.

20:53.717 --> 20:55.300
Here she is coming into the guy's house

20:55.301 --> 20:57.820
to make the sale.

20:57.821 --> 20:59.177
It's the same person.

20:59.178 --> 21:01.081
What's an antiquities
expert at a history museum

21:01.082 --> 21:04.661
doing selling stolen treasures
to Corsican drug lords?

21:04.662 --> 21:07.230
There's nothing in her
background to support it.

21:07.231 --> 21:09.132
I don't know. Maybe she needs the money.

21:09.133 --> 21:10.396
Maybe she just likes gangsters.

21:10.397 --> 21:12.402
The only thing we really need to know

21:12.403 --> 21:15.038
is where she got the reliquary.

21:15.039 --> 21:18.107
We can bring her in, but she
can't know what we're up to.

21:18.108 --> 21:19.669
Maybe we could use French intelligence.

21:19.670 --> 21:21.653
I'm sure they'd be interested
in what she's doing.

21:21.654 --> 21:22.345
Not yet.

21:22.346 --> 21:24.247
You bring her in quietly,

21:24.248 --> 21:25.615
find out what she knows,

21:25.616 --> 21:29.217
and take it from there.

21:30.353 --> 21:31.254
Morning.

21:31.255 --> 21:32.789
- Morning. - Morning.
- Morning

21:32.790 --> 21:36.125
Marcia Forman is having a field
day with this dissent memo.

21:36.126 --> 21:37.594
Marcia Forman is an unhappy woman

21:37.595 --> 21:39.796
desperately trying to
make herself relevant.

21:39.797 --> 21:41.264
Aren't we all?

21:41.265 --> 21:43.132
Except I'm not a woman.

21:43.133 --> 21:46.636
Sorry. finishing my
first round of interviews.

21:46.637 --> 21:47.493
Any leads?

21:47.494 --> 21:49.372
I talked to most of the
mid-level Africa desk.

21:49.373 --> 21:51.407
They're in full denial mode.

21:51.408 --> 21:54.143
But I have IT doing an
e-mail search for terms

21:54.144 --> 21:56.247
that might indicate a grudge
against the White House.

21:56.248 --> 21:58.314
Dalton/idiot, McCord/idiot,

21:58.315 --> 21:59.582
- Ouch.
- Dalton/traitor...

21:59.583 --> 22:01.451
Daisy, keep at it. Thank you.

22:01.452 --> 22:03.920
All right, where are we
on the sanctions on Angola?

22:03.921 --> 22:06.122
- Anybody...
- Excuse me, Madam Secretary.

22:06.123 --> 22:07.457
I'm sorry to interrupt,

22:07.458 --> 22:10.727
but I'm having a little
trouble getting my work done

22:10.728 --> 22:13.089
while my entire staff is being
rounded up for interrogation.

22:13.090 --> 22:15.633
- It was an investigation.
- We have to look into the memo leak.

22:15.634 --> 22:17.033
It's been very destabilizing.

22:17.034 --> 22:18.701
Not to mention criminal.

22:18.702 --> 22:20.436
Fine.

22:20.437 --> 22:21.471
I leaked it.

22:21.472 --> 22:23.206
You want to arrest somebody,

22:23.207 --> 22:24.207
arrest me.

22:24.208 --> 22:26.141
Okay, come on.

22:28.926 --> 22:31.481
I am sorry for questioning
your staff, but...

22:31.482 --> 22:33.583
Bestilo's put her under house arrest.

22:33.584 --> 22:34.751
Kalanga.

22:34.752 --> 22:36.419
Really?

22:36.420 --> 22:38.788
- When?
- This morning, to protect her security.

22:38.789 --> 22:40.356
And I would love to see this office

22:40.357 --> 22:42.291
take half as much interest

22:42.292 --> 22:45.428
in a supposedly democratic
ally openly stealing an election

22:45.429 --> 22:47.330
as you have shown in
one leaked document.

22:47.331 --> 22:50.967
Hey, Susan, you got to stop
accusing me of not caring.

22:50.968 --> 22:52.635
There are parameters and you know that.

22:52.636 --> 22:54.837
When was the last time you
set foot in Southern Africa?

22:54.838 --> 22:57.006
- I...
- But you find time to go to NFL games,

22:57.007 --> 23:00.743
and... I'm so sorry.

23:00.744 --> 23:01.811
I... You know what?

23:01.812 --> 23:03.012
I-I just give up.

23:03.013 --> 23:04.647
I'd rather work in the private sector

23:04.648 --> 23:05.951
and actually get something done.

23:05.952 --> 23:08.184
- Susan...
- Thank you for taking a chance on me.

23:08.185 --> 23:11.988
Madam Secretary, you can
consider this my resignation.

23:31.138 --> 23:33.440
Can we talk about this?

23:33.441 --> 23:34.452
Yes.

23:34.453 --> 23:37.088
I'd appreciate it if you
let me turn myself in.

23:37.089 --> 23:39.823
I'd rather my staff not
see me led out by security.

23:39.824 --> 23:42.392
I know you didn't leak that memo.

23:42.393 --> 23:44.463
That's not what my memoir will say.

23:44.464 --> 23:46.327
And if you think I'm
gonna inform on anybody...

23:46.328 --> 23:49.564
No, I don't actually care who leaked it.

23:49.565 --> 23:52.467
I just don't want to lose you.

23:52.468 --> 23:54.936
But you have to understand.

23:54.937 --> 23:57.939
I-I'm playing ten
dimensional chess here.

23:57.940 --> 24:01.643
If I could've threatened to
cut off agricultural imports

24:01.644 --> 24:04.412
and sanction oil when I called Bestilo,

24:04.413 --> 24:06.713
I would've done it.

24:08.350 --> 24:10.425
But we are having an election of our own

24:10.426 --> 24:13.028
and, like it or not, we
all serve at the pleasure.

24:13.029 --> 24:14.293
And this is exactly the problem

24:14.294 --> 24:15.570
with our approach in Africa.

24:15.571 --> 24:19.003
We go in with our studies,
and our expertise, and our aid,

24:19.004 --> 24:20.705
and we don't even know
what we don't know.

24:20.706 --> 24:23.308
Bestilo doesn't care
if his people starve.

24:23.309 --> 24:25.410
So, if you really want
to get him where he lives,

24:25.411 --> 24:27.445
you don't read reports.

24:27.446 --> 24:29.480
You talk to people who know him.

24:30.215 --> 24:32.850
You're right.

24:35.754 --> 24:38.021
So how do we get him where he lives?

24:40.392 --> 24:42.360
Putting your opponent under house arrest

24:42.361 --> 24:44.062
is clearly meant to protect

24:44.063 --> 24:47.732
your own security, Mr.
President, not Kalanga's.

24:47.733 --> 24:49.367
I do not wish to run against a martyr.

24:49.368 --> 24:51.569
But as always, Madam Secretary,

24:51.570 --> 24:53.738
I appreciate your opinion.

24:53.739 --> 24:56.174
It is the United States' opinion.

24:56.175 --> 25:00.445
Therefore, we're demanding
the release of Bertilde Kalanga

25:00.446 --> 25:01.813
within two hours.

25:01.814 --> 25:05.550
If you do not comply, I'm
prepared to impose a travel ban

25:05.551 --> 25:09.087
on all Angolan citizens
into the United States.

25:09.088 --> 25:12.457
It would be a shame if
Amalia Salessu were unable

25:12.458 --> 25:15.492
to finish her sophomore
year at Stanford.

25:17.128 --> 25:18.181
But, of course,

25:18.182 --> 25:20.031
if she's no longer attending school

25:20.032 --> 25:20.949
out of the country,

25:20.950 --> 25:24.402
maybe she can get to know
her half-sister better.

25:24.403 --> 25:28.206
Unless, of course, your daughter Lauana

25:28.207 --> 25:30.909
doesn't know she has a half-sister.

25:30.910 --> 25:35.680
I have to wonder, Elizabeth,
at President Dalton's boldness

25:35.681 --> 25:37.336
in dictating the election procedures

25:37.337 --> 25:39.172
of a small African nation

25:39.173 --> 25:41.040
when he himself seems
to be making up the rules

25:41.041 --> 25:42.130
as he goes along.

25:42.131 --> 25:45.604
You have enjoyed many years of
generous support and aid from us

25:45.605 --> 25:47.480
with little accountability.

25:47.481 --> 25:49.982
But accountability comes

25:49.983 --> 25:51.784
in many forms, Damiano.

25:51.785 --> 25:56.389
I regret my years of loyalty
mean so little to you.

25:56.390 --> 25:59.158
Our warm relations can be restored

25:59.159 --> 26:02.395
if you agree to free Bertilde Kalanga

26:02.396 --> 26:03.696
and allow your people

26:03.697 --> 26:08.768
a free and fair election.

26:08.769 --> 26:10.770
As your own president follows

26:10.771 --> 26:13.972
the dictates of democracy, so shall I.

26:15.843 --> 26:17.944
That seemed a little ominous.

26:17.945 --> 26:21.447
Trust me, that's as close to a
checkmate as you're gonna get.

26:21.448 --> 26:22.615
He's shaking.

26:22.616 --> 26:25.985
Well, let's see if an
illegitimate daughter

26:25.986 --> 26:27.752
will have any effect.

26:33.526 --> 26:34.443
Brilliant.

26:34.444 --> 26:35.806
Finally come round to real tea.

26:36.412 --> 26:37.679
Trying.

26:37.680 --> 26:39.348
Kind of makes my teeth squeak.

26:39.349 --> 26:42.451
Well, that's because it's
actual tea, not colored water.

26:42.452 --> 26:44.319
Leave the bag in, woman.

26:44.320 --> 26:45.820
Have I taught you nothing?

26:46.555 --> 26:48.923
I am incorrigible.

26:51.159 --> 26:53.895
I, I heard you
say that to your mother

26:53.896 --> 26:57.032
when you thought I was out of the room.

26:57.033 --> 27:00.035
...dear.

27:00.036 --> 27:03.238
Of course, I-I had made
the scandalous error

27:03.239 --> 27:05.741
of pouring the milk after the tea.

27:05.742 --> 27:07.042
I'm sorry I said that.

27:07.043 --> 27:08.744
I don't think that.

27:08.745 --> 27:11.013
I actually find you quite corrigible.

27:11.014 --> 27:15.384
The whole summer, um, I-I felt like...

27:15.385 --> 27:16.918
the idiot American girl

27:16.919 --> 27:19.988
who doesn't know how to drink tea

27:19.989 --> 27:23.125
and doesn't have the right shoes.

27:23.126 --> 27:24.429
That's not how I see you at all.

27:24.430 --> 27:27.362
Why would anyone pour
the milk before the tea?

27:27.363 --> 27:28.630
It doesn't make any sense,

27:28.631 --> 27:30.666
you can't tell how strong it is.

27:30.667 --> 27:31.733
I looked it up.

27:31.734 --> 27:33.201
George Orwell is with me on this.

27:33.202 --> 27:34.770
God, I hate England.

27:34.771 --> 27:35.904
I'm right there with you.

27:35.905 --> 27:38.940
It brings out the absolute worst in me.

27:38.941 --> 27:41.710
I'm sorry.

27:41.711 --> 27:44.012
Honestly, I mean, the
thought of going back there

27:44.013 --> 27:47.047
kind of gives me a panic attack.

27:47.816 --> 27:49.984
Well, then let's not.

27:50.719 --> 27:52.187
Really?

27:52.188 --> 27:53.889
I'm miserable without you.

27:53.890 --> 27:54.890
I love the States.

27:54.891 --> 27:56.925
You love the States.

27:56.926 --> 27:59.226
Let's live in the States.

28:01.296 --> 28:03.065
But what about your fellowship?

28:03.066 --> 28:06.535
Please, if a cat can be both
alive and dead simultaneously,

28:06.536 --> 28:08.570
I'm sure I can find another fellowship

28:08.571 --> 28:10.939
in theoretical physics.

28:10.940 --> 28:12.803
Probably only makes sense
to another physicist.

28:12.804 --> 28:14.476
Um, the important thing

28:14.477 --> 28:17.112
is that we are our best
selves to each other.

28:17.113 --> 28:19.413
Always.

28:22.250 --> 28:24.286
All right.

28:24.287 --> 28:26.054
Keep talking physics to me.

28:26.055 --> 28:27.155
Yeah?

28:27.156 --> 28:29.123
No, don't.

28:32.683 --> 28:33.995
We get the archeologist?

28:33.996 --> 28:37.731
We just brought her in,
but she's not talking yet.

29:34.356 --> 29:36.156
Ask her about the statues.

29:47.969 --> 29:49.604
Those are the St. Gabriel statues.

29:49.605 --> 29:51.373
She's dealing with Hizb Al-Shahid.

29:51.374 --> 29:53.875
And the best part is,
they haven't seen her.

29:53.876 --> 29:56.812
Right, so, we pick her up, we
let her think she's being held

29:56.813 --> 29:57.859
by French intelligence.

29:57.860 --> 29:59.748
We'll find an agent
who can pass for her,

29:59.749 --> 30:01.933
set up a meeting to buy one
of these statues, and boom,

30:01.934 --> 30:04.486
we have a direct line to
Hizb Al-Shahid in Algeria.

30:04.487 --> 30:07.255
Except these guys go through couriers

30:07.256 --> 30:08.690
because they can't meet with women.

30:08.691 --> 30:12.227
So, all we have to do is find an agent

30:12.228 --> 30:13.695
who looks like this archaeologist,

30:13.696 --> 30:14.763
who speaks perfect French,

30:14.764 --> 30:17.186
and then somehow
convince these extremists

30:17.187 --> 30:18.867
that they should violate their religion

30:18.868 --> 30:21.403
and meet her face-to-face
so she can set up the op.

30:21.404 --> 30:24.906
But, yeah, once we do all that,

30:24.907 --> 30:26.674
it's like you said, "Boom."

30:37.063 --> 30:38.376
Good morning, Madam Secretary.

30:38.399 --> 30:40.067
Not while I'm still reading

30:40.068 --> 30:41.635
about the dissent memo.

30:41.636 --> 30:43.437
We just got word that Bertilde Kalanga

30:43.438 --> 30:45.539
was released from
house arrest in Angola.

30:45.540 --> 30:46.707
Hope that helps.

30:46.708 --> 30:47.941
It does.

30:47.942 --> 30:48.976
When do the polls open?

30:48.977 --> 30:50.143
About 16 hours.

30:50.144 --> 30:51.745
Assistant Secretary
Thompson is here,

30:51.746 --> 30:53.981
presumably to share the
diplomatic equivalent

30:53.982 --> 30:54.982
of a high five.

30:54.983 --> 30:56.750
Susan, I just heard.

30:56.751 --> 30:58.285
Bestilo released Kalanga.

30:58.286 --> 31:01.687
He also shut down all
Internet service in Angola.

31:02.689 --> 31:05.559
He cannot stop suppressing
freedom of speech, can he?

31:05.560 --> 31:07.027
It's worse than that.

31:07.028 --> 31:09.131
I just got word from the
embassy, military and police

31:09.132 --> 31:11.565
are surrounding poll
stations as we speak.

31:11.566 --> 31:13.533
What is he doing?

31:13.534 --> 31:16.436
Suppressing voters with
no way for anyone to see

31:16.437 --> 31:18.238
what he's up to until it's too late.

31:18.239 --> 31:19.973
Won't the press expose him?

31:19.974 --> 31:22.075
- No, they do whatever he tells
them to do. - He controls it.

31:22.076 --> 31:23.710
But he can't control social media.

31:23.711 --> 31:25.679
If the people show each
other what he's doing,

31:25.680 --> 31:27.381
he knows they'll rise up.

31:27.382 --> 31:29.916
Same reason Mubarak shut down
Internet during the Arab Spring.

31:29.917 --> 31:31.385
Said it was for maintenance.

31:31.386 --> 31:33.420
Maintenance of the status quo.

31:35.223 --> 31:38.091
I thought we were
getting through to him.

31:38.092 --> 31:39.926
We should initiate a travel ban.

31:39.927 --> 31:41.895
Threaten to cut off food,
even if we can't do it.

31:41.896 --> 31:44.931
No, we-we can't make threats
if we we're not willing

31:44.932 --> 31:48.001
to follow through on them.

31:48.002 --> 31:49.803
It's like you said,

31:49.804 --> 31:51.805
what does he care if his people starve?

31:51.806 --> 31:54.775
Unfortunately, this is the
position we've put Angolans in

31:54.776 --> 31:57.144
by making them dependent
on our food supply.

31:57.145 --> 32:00.981
What about U.N. forces?

32:00.982 --> 32:04.351
Hang on.

32:04.352 --> 32:05.819
You're absolutely right.

32:05.820 --> 32:08.388
Subsidized agriculture
was the wrong idea.

32:08.389 --> 32:11.858
We have to let them harvest
their own crops, right?

32:11.859 --> 32:14.728
Blake!

32:14.729 --> 32:16.263
Who did you say sent you?

32:16.264 --> 32:19.366
I represent a buyer from
Bastia, Lucas HervÃ©.

32:19.367 --> 32:20.734
Why doesn't he come himself?

32:20.735 --> 32:22.769
He's a businessman. He
needs to be discreet.

32:22.770 --> 32:26.106
So he sends an archaeologist
who deals in the black market?

32:26.107 --> 32:27.441
You're pretty high risk.

32:27.442 --> 32:29.976
I have connections to
passionate collectors

32:29.977 --> 32:31.311
from many different worlds.

32:31.312 --> 32:34.446
Did the reliquary contain
the relics of St. Augustine?

32:35.415 --> 32:37.784
It was only the outside
the buyer was interested in.

32:37.785 --> 32:39.186
Sounds like you're covering.

32:39.187 --> 32:41.488
That's something an
archaeologist would know.

32:41.489 --> 32:45.058
But not something that
HS would care about.

32:45.059 --> 32:46.526
Where are you from?

32:46.527 --> 32:47.694
Paris.

32:47.695 --> 32:49.029
18th arrondissement.

32:49.030 --> 32:50.963
Then why does your
accent sound southern?

32:51.698 --> 32:53.433
My mother is from Marseille.

32:53.434 --> 32:55.102
I spent my summers there growing up.

32:55.103 --> 32:56.436
I lived with my grandmother.

32:56.437 --> 32:58.638
You just gave us three
ways to pull you apart

32:58.639 --> 33:00.173
when you just needed to give us one.

33:01.876 --> 33:03.610
Of course.

33:03.611 --> 33:04.778
Ask me again.

33:04.779 --> 33:07.547
I think we got enough.

33:07.548 --> 33:09.249
Great work, Cecile.

33:09.250 --> 33:10.716
Very impressive.

33:14.921 --> 33:17.590
Thanks for coming in.

33:22.296 --> 33:24.564
Well, she looks like our archaeologist.

33:24.565 --> 33:26.266
Her French is perfect.

33:26.267 --> 33:27.501
She's too green.

33:27.502 --> 33:30.070
I know from when
Elizabeth was starting out,

33:30.071 --> 33:32.111
you want an agent with
something to prove.

33:32.112 --> 33:32.739
She can do it.

33:32.740 --> 33:34.574
She'll be sitting face-to-face

33:34.575 --> 33:36.432
with members of Hizb Al-Shahid.

33:36.433 --> 33:37.976
It's too important to go with an agent

33:37.977 --> 33:40.013
because she reminds you of your wife.

33:40.014 --> 33:42.648
It's too important not to.

33:43.450 --> 33:45.118
Of course.

33:45.119 --> 33:47.454
Yes, I promise.

33:47.455 --> 33:49.790
Okay, Mum. Yeah, bye, bye, bye, bye.

33:49.791 --> 33:51.391
Hey, I think I found a really cool place

33:51.415 --> 33:52.359
in Kingsman Park.

33:52.360 --> 33:54.661
Sorry, I'm completely
late for my interview.

33:54.662 --> 33:57.497
And this public transport
app is utter rubbish.

33:57.498 --> 33:59.933
- Sorry, um...
- Bad phone call?

33:59.934 --> 34:02.469
Yeah. Apparently my father is flummoxed

34:02.470 --> 34:04.237
that I've thrown away my career,

34:04.238 --> 34:05.572
and he's decided to cut me off.

34:05.573 --> 34:07.207
Not that I mind that too much.

34:07.208 --> 34:08.440
I've always hated the way he dangles

34:08.442 --> 34:10.025
the inheritance to keep us all in line.

34:10.025 --> 34:12.344
Quite happy to step out of
that mini colonialist drama.

34:12.346 --> 34:14.650
How do you not know where
George Washington University is?

34:14.650 --> 34:16.983
I'm confused... I thought
your parents were academics.

34:16.984 --> 34:18.367
Yeah, well, they can afford to be,

34:18.368 --> 34:20.520
thanks to Mum's title and all that.

34:20.521 --> 34:22.489
Your mother has a title?

34:22.489 --> 34:25.025
Yes. Lady Sutherland.

34:25.025 --> 34:26.927
Dad just married in,
but it doesn't stop him

34:26.928 --> 34:29.081
from using it for all it's worth.

34:29.496 --> 34:32.431
I'm sorry, how did I
not know any of this?

34:32.433 --> 34:33.801
Could it be the accent?

34:33.802 --> 34:35.634
I actually worked really hard on it.

34:36.043 --> 34:37.504
Okay, look, you'd have hated it.

34:37.505 --> 34:38.772
The country manor in the Cotswolds

34:38.773 --> 34:40.841
is basically just a farm
with glowering portraits.

34:40.842 --> 34:42.763
The chateau in Provence
is a little bit more fun,

34:42.764 --> 34:44.748
but I think my sister will
have us over for visits

34:44.748 --> 34:46.179
so she can just lord it over me.

34:46.179 --> 34:48.547
- I have to go. I really have to go.
- Jareth, stop.

34:51.117 --> 34:54.721
Is your father right?

34:54.722 --> 34:56.422
Is this a huge mistake?

34:56.424 --> 34:58.091
It's too late now.
The Brexit vote is in,

34:58.092 --> 34:59.292
and there's no turning back.

34:59.293 --> 35:01.261
- So I'll talk to you later. Mwah!
- Wh...

35:01.262 --> 35:02.708
I really have to go.

35:02.709 --> 35:06.374
Scott, thank you so
much for taking the time.

35:07.168 --> 35:09.169
Where you calling me from, 2012?

35:09.170 --> 35:10.804
Super Mario had more pixels.

35:10.805 --> 35:12.229
You guys gotta let me help you out.

35:13.941 --> 35:16.943
Well, I'm... I'm glad
you're in a charitable mood

35:16.944 --> 35:20.128
because I've got a... a proposition.

35:21.115 --> 35:23.817
Do you remember saying
that if you wanted to,

35:23.818 --> 35:26.611
you could extend free Internet access

35:26.612 --> 35:29.456
to all of Southern Africa?

35:29.457 --> 35:31.625
By piggybacking off one network, yeah.

35:31.626 --> 35:33.393
I might have overstated the reach.

35:33.394 --> 35:35.495
If I can make a deal with Zambia,

35:35.496 --> 35:38.498
do you think you could
set up a makeshift network

35:38.499 --> 35:40.400
in Angola in...

35:40.401 --> 35:42.202
Well, in the next 12 hours?

35:42.203 --> 35:44.371
Well, I assume this
is a tax-free situation

35:44.372 --> 35:46.332
we're talking about... no OTTs.

35:46.333 --> 35:49.175
Well... that's the thing.

35:49.176 --> 35:52.579
Um, this network you're setting up

35:52.580 --> 35:55.081
will only exist for 24 hours.

35:55.082 --> 35:58.585
Just enough time for Angola
to elect its next president

35:58.586 --> 36:00.654
in a free and fair election.

36:00.655 --> 36:06.092
After that, you'd have to pay
whatever taxes Angola wants.

36:06.093 --> 36:08.128
But if the people's

36:08.129 --> 36:09.963
candidate wins, I'm pretty sure

36:09.964 --> 36:11.898
we can discourage state-run telecoms

36:11.899 --> 36:13.233
- Here you go.
- all together.

36:13.234 --> 36:14.534
Well, I like the sound of that.

36:14.535 --> 36:16.903
Good, because you'll
be helping me do that

36:16.904 --> 36:18.138
by sending in a team

36:18.139 --> 36:19.773
to train Angolans to build

36:19.774 --> 36:23.977
their own private telecom
networks... for free.

36:23.978 --> 36:25.445
The way it should be.

36:25.446 --> 36:28.014
However, I-I do have to tell you that

36:28.015 --> 36:30.517
if Bertilde Kalanga doesn't win today,

36:30.518 --> 36:32.385
then, well, both of us are probably

36:32.386 --> 36:34.054
never gonna work in Angola again.

36:37.091 --> 36:38.625
Why would I agree to this?

36:38.626 --> 36:41.828
Because you want to build democracy.

36:41.829 --> 36:45.231
And because, if your company, KronicDM,

36:45.232 --> 36:48.568
is the force behind an
Internet-led revolution

36:48.569 --> 36:51.838
that leads Angola to
expose a corrupt regime

36:51.839 --> 36:53.640
and elect its first female president,

36:53.641 --> 36:59.245
that's gonna make a really
kickass Super Bowl commercial.

37:08.706 --> 37:12.140
Yup. Ballot-stuffing in Benguela.

37:12.141 --> 37:13.876
I've got it on a live feed.

37:13.877 --> 37:15.345
I've got somebody facing down a line

37:15.346 --> 37:17.547
of military trucks trying
to block the poll access.

37:17.548 --> 37:19.682
Yeah, and a bunch of people joining him.

37:19.683 --> 37:22.018
It's like a flash mob
without all the dancing.

37:22.019 --> 37:25.254
Well, the news cycle has
shifted from the leaked memo.

37:25.255 --> 37:27.156
Thank you, KronicDM.

37:27.157 --> 37:28.925
Thank the Angolans.

37:28.926 --> 37:31.461
They're the ones putting their
lives at risk to expose him.

37:31.462 --> 37:32.462
Yes.

37:32.463 --> 37:33.830
All right, that was the embassy.

37:33.831 --> 37:36.699
So far, everything seems calm in Luanda.

37:36.700 --> 37:38.403
Let's hope the eyes
of the world are enough

37:38.404 --> 37:40.336
to keep Bestilo from lashing out.

37:42.581 --> 37:43.373
Hey, Dad.

37:43.374 --> 37:45.908
Hey. Where's Jareth?

37:45.909 --> 37:47.276
He's out with friends.

37:47.277 --> 37:48.945
I was at the library.

37:48.946 --> 37:50.713
Want to watch the
Angolan election with me?

37:50.714 --> 37:52.815
- First woman president.
- Kalanga won?

37:52.816 --> 37:54.650
Not yet. Here. It's vegan.

37:54.651 --> 37:58.321
Mom told me about the whole
"I hate England" crisis.

37:58.322 --> 38:00.656
Yeah, well, it's been replaced

38:00.657 --> 38:04.327
by the "Jareth is losing
out on his inheritance

38:04.328 --> 38:05.928
if he stays here" crisis.

38:05.929 --> 38:07.330
- They're disinheriting him?
- Yeah.

38:07.331 --> 38:09.031
Wow, that's extreme.

38:09.032 --> 38:10.933
It also might be because
he's marrying someone

38:10.934 --> 38:12.335
who doesn't know how to pour tea,

38:12.336 --> 38:13.703
but I didn't ask.

38:13.704 --> 38:16.139
Well, even if they cut
him off, they're still

38:16.140 --> 38:17.106
gonna be your in-laws,

38:17.107 --> 38:19.809
so you guys gotta work that out.

38:19.810 --> 38:21.077
How is Jareth doing?

38:21.078 --> 38:23.413
Great. Supposedly.

38:23.414 --> 38:25.114
Couldn't be happier

38:25.115 --> 38:27.517
about being liberated from the tyranny

38:27.518 --> 38:30.086
of title and property.

38:30.087 --> 38:32.388
But he's conflicted.

38:32.389 --> 38:33.890
I know he is.

38:33.891 --> 38:36.525
Especially about leaving Oxford.

38:46.068 --> 38:50.138
Isn't this where you give me
the wise counsel of experience?

38:51.374 --> 38:54.343
Sorry, I got nothin'
except welcome to marriage.

38:54.344 --> 38:58.080
Huge, important life decisions...

38:58.081 --> 38:59.549
with unexpected consequences,

38:59.550 --> 39:02.284
all taken on a leap of faith.

39:03.152 --> 39:06.956
What if we stay, and
he ends up resenting me

39:06.957 --> 39:08.391
for losing everything?

39:08.392 --> 39:09.926
Honey, he will.

39:09.927 --> 39:12.795
A-at some point.

39:12.796 --> 39:16.264
And you guys will work through it.

39:19.470 --> 39:20.736
Or not.

39:20.737 --> 39:23.004
That can happen, too.

39:24.841 --> 39:27.443
That's it?

39:27.444 --> 39:29.011
What about the, you know,

39:29.012 --> 39:32.215
if you love each other, you
can make it through anything?

39:32.216 --> 39:33.649
You know what my dad said to me

39:33.650 --> 39:35.618
the night before I got married?

39:35.619 --> 39:37.720
"Marriage is the nicest way

39:37.721 --> 39:41.257
to confront your own
inadequacies on a daily basis"

39:41.258 --> 39:44.060
You should write that in a song.

39:44.061 --> 39:49.364
It's also the greatest
journey you'll ever go on.

39:50.700 --> 39:54.436
And you get to go on it
with your best friend.

39:59.375 --> 40:02.478
When are they gonna call this?

40:02.479 --> 40:05.281
I definitely don't have
time for Bush v. Gore.

40:05.282 --> 40:07.027
My wife's gonna kill me as it is.

40:07.028 --> 40:09.051
If they haven't called
it, he hasn't stolen it.

40:09.052 --> 40:12.021
Well, still no word from the embassy,

40:12.022 --> 40:14.757
but the Bureau of African Affairs

40:14.758 --> 40:16.325
sent over doughnuts.

40:16.326 --> 40:17.627
Suck-ups!

40:17.628 --> 40:19.462
Well, I am not above
a suck-up doughnut.

40:19.463 --> 40:20.830
Glazed.

40:24.267 --> 40:27.169
Sorry about the investigation.

40:27.170 --> 40:29.529
Are you offering me my
own department's doughnut

40:29.530 --> 40:30.206
as an apology?

40:30.207 --> 40:31.422
Yep.

40:31.423 --> 40:33.776
Let's just say it's more of
a thank you than an apology.

40:33.777 --> 40:37.280
Releasing the dissent
memo, whoever released it...

40:37.281 --> 40:38.714
I'm sorry it was necessary.

40:38.715 --> 40:41.784
They haven't wrapped this thing up yet?

40:41.785 --> 40:43.019
Still waiting.

40:43.020 --> 40:45.621
May I interest you in a doughnut?

40:45.622 --> 40:48.357
No, thanks.

40:48.358 --> 40:51.479
- Where's the, Secretary?
- We did it!

40:51.480 --> 40:52.895
- Kalanga won!
- Yes, we did it!

40:52.896 --> 40:55.231
Look at that!

40:55.232 --> 40:57.133
And you didn't even
have to use agriculture.

40:57.134 --> 41:00.069
All I had to do was
work with the people.

41:00.070 --> 41:01.774
I'd like to see the New York Times

41:01.775 --> 41:03.022
hold out on us now.

41:03.023 --> 41:06.008
Russ, don't be so sentimental!

41:06.009 --> 41:10.012
Just stopped by to let you know
we're on the ballot in Ohio.

41:10.013 --> 41:11.447
Not that you're campaigning.

41:11.448 --> 41:13.115
This day is full of wonders.

41:13.116 --> 41:15.651
True that.

41:15.652 --> 41:17.720
Actually, I'll...

41:17.721 --> 41:19.422
I'll have a sprinkles.

41:19.423 --> 41:21.357
You should fly in for the inauguration.

41:21.358 --> 41:22.858
It's good optics.

41:22.859 --> 41:25.428
Um, I may fit that in my schedule.

41:25.429 --> 41:27.997
Will you join me?

41:27.998 --> 41:30.433
Hey, guys, check it out.

41:33.770 --> 41:35.371
Wow.

42:19.281 --> 42:20.950
It's taking too long.

42:20.951 --> 42:23.585
We should have put a wire on her.

42:28.858 --> 42:30.492
That's her.

42:31.427 --> 42:33.729
She's alone. That's good.

42:33.730 --> 42:34.964
Cecile, all clear?

42:34.965 --> 42:37.166
They bought it.

42:37.167 --> 42:38.630
And they're going to let me appraise

42:38.631 --> 42:39.735
the statues in Algeria.

42:39.736 --> 42:42.004
We meet sometime next week.

42:42.005 --> 42:43.139
That's fantastic.

42:43.140 --> 42:45.707
Good work. Get back to base.

42:52.335 --> 42:54.192
Did we set a pick-up?

43:00.489 --> 43:02.558
This is Black Dog Station.

43:02.559 --> 43:05.041
Who the hell just took our agent?

43:05.042 --> 43:12.437
