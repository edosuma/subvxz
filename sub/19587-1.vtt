00:24.633 --> 00:27.300
Get that boy
off your teat, Gladys.

00:27.367 --> 00:29.467
He's too old to be coddled...

00:29.533 --> 00:32.267
And what's he gonna
get from you, tell me that?

00:32.333 --> 00:34.233
Sitting around drinking
all day.

00:35.333 --> 00:37.733
That ain't gonna get him
no place.

00:37.800 --> 00:39.633
Why don't you get a job?

00:39.700 --> 00:41.633
You know my back's out.

00:41.700 --> 00:43.700
And Elvis ain't getting
C's and D's

00:43.767 --> 00:46.567
'cause I'm sucking on a beer
now and again...

00:52.800 --> 00:55.133
That song, pun'kin.

00:55.200 --> 00:57.200
That's grown folk's music.

00:57.267 --> 00:59.100
You shouldn't be listening.

00:59.167 --> 01:01.567
Ain't nothing' but a diddly
ol' song, Momma.

01:05.267 --> 01:10.700
"For God is the King
of all the Earth,
sing praises with a psalm!"

01:19.067 --> 01:20.667
You wanna help the boy?

01:20.733 --> 01:25.067
Wash that grease
outta his hair
and get him a damn haircut.

01:25.133 --> 01:27.300
Tell him to put down
that guitar.

01:27.367 --> 01:29.733
Then maybe he'll
get some friends
'sides his mama.

01:29.800 --> 01:31.633
Where you off to?

01:31.700 --> 01:34.367
Just gimme half the attention
you give him.

01:34.433 --> 01:37.100

02:58.733 --> 03:01.967
And this is how
they all hopped on it.

03:02.067 --> 03:04.300
What are we going
to do if we run out
of gas here?

03:04.367 --> 03:07.400
Well,
they have cars, Becks!

03:07.467 --> 03:09.500
I'm pretty sure they have
gas stations.

03:09.567 --> 03:14.333
So you're just going
to leave us in the car
while you go in and get gas?

03:14.400 --> 03:17.667
Told you we should
have filled up back
at the Flying A.

03:18.800 --> 03:20.567

Huh!

03:26.333 --> 03:28.533
Sam,
why are we stopping?

03:37.433 --> 03:39.500
Sam, why are we stopping?

03:41.333 --> 03:43.700
Oh, you can stay
in the car, baby.

03:46.200 --> 03:47.667
Hey, hun, look!

03:48.800 --> 03:49.867

03:50.900 --> 03:52.700
-Some kin of yours?
-Mmm!

03:53.933 --> 03:55.433
Ain't no telling.

03:55.500 --> 03:57.067
Cashbox just done
a big write-up on him.
Whoo-whee!

03:57.133 --> 03:59.133
When he jumps on a record,
boy, you get outta the way.

03:59.200 --> 04:00.467

Man, someone's just
washed out his drawers.
Must be the weekend.

04:27.933 --> 04:29.867
I'll tell you what,
I sure hope "Dudz does it",

04:29.933 --> 04:33.167
'cause they've got some
competition, baby. Yeah!

04:33.233 --> 04:34.533
Fug detergent!

Well, "If Dudz won't do it,
then fug it."

05:11.367 --> 05:12.533
-That there's my wife...
-Phillips!

05:12.600 --> 05:15.067
Dear God, man,
I knew I liked you, huh?

05:15.133 --> 05:16.767
Do you reckon we're related?

05:16.833 --> 05:19.700
Hell, I got kissing cousins
all across north Alabama.

05:24.933 --> 05:28.067

05:58.467 --> 05:59.833
Uh, no, no, no, no!

05:59.900 --> 06:02.167
No, don't be scared,

06:46.633 --> 06:48.467
This is the colored
part of town.

06:48.533 --> 06:50.067
We shouldn't be here.

06:52.667 --> 06:55.067
-Would you listen to that?
-Elvis!

06:55.067 --> 06:56.467
Wow, Trix.

06:56.533 --> 06:58.967
Now, ain't that
the most beautiful thing
you ever heard?

06:59.067 --> 07:00.167
No.

07:00.233 --> 07:01.900
We shouldn't be here.

07:01.967 --> 07:05.667
Oh, but, listen.
They got the...
They got the feeling on in.

means to me, don't you, hun?

07:23.267 --> 07:24.833
Of course.

change would be good for you,

07:28.067 --> 07:29.900
"As long as
it isn't too stressful."

07:29.967 --> 07:32.600
Aw, Lord Almighty, I'm fine.

07:32.667 --> 07:37.467
Now, who wouldn't go
stone crazy reading dumb old
commercials day in, day out?

07:37.533 --> 07:40.500
I just want the Sam Phillips
I married.

07:40.567 --> 07:42.067
I want him back.

07:42.067 --> 07:43.633
And you have him.

07:47.067 --> 07:50.500
This is what I was put on
this Earth to do, Becks,

07:50.567 --> 07:53.233
and I know you came here
to help me do it.

07:53.300 --> 07:55.767
I just want you to know
it's gonna be all right.

08:02.600 --> 08:04.667
Marion!

08:04.733 --> 08:06.833
I swear, I thought
Marion had...

08:09.267 --> 08:10.700
Oh!

08:10.767 --> 08:14.567
Sam, we sunk
every penny into this.

08:17.067 --> 08:18.133
Marion!

08:19.367 --> 08:20.733
Coming!

08:23.900 --> 08:25.600
Deliveries were late.

08:25.667 --> 08:28.533
Half this stuff
just came today.

08:28.600 --> 08:32.600
And those microphones
you wanted are gonna be
another two days, at least.

08:33.767 --> 08:35.500
Well, cancel the session.

08:35.567 --> 08:36.933
Well, we can't do that.

08:37.067 --> 08:38.433
We're cutting shows
for the Skunk Meadow Boys,

08:38.500 --> 08:41.367
and they're sponsored
by Arkansas Rural Electric.

08:41.433 --> 08:44.167
We'll blow our reputation
before we start.

08:44.233 --> 08:45.467
Man!

08:45.533 --> 08:47.267
Plus, I took a deposit
and we've spent it.

08:47.333 --> 08:49.800
Well, what are we doing
just standing around?

08:49.867 --> 08:52.667
We gotta turn this place
into a recording studio!

08:53.367 --> 08:55.200
You're right.

08:55.267 --> 08:56.300
Hold on one second.

09:12.067 --> 09:13.067
Yeah.

hang our first hit record.

09:35.633 --> 09:37.567
They bought it off
from the bank.

09:37.633 --> 09:39.300
What do you mean, bought it?

09:39.367 --> 09:41.467
There weren't meant to be
no colored here.

09:41.533 --> 09:43.433
You damn well know that.

09:43.500 --> 09:46.100
You could have bought it.
It's been on offer
for two years near about.

09:46.167 --> 09:48.667
I ain't got no 2,000 dollars.
But that ain't the point!

09:48.733 --> 09:50.267
Well, I dunno what to
tell you.

09:50.333 --> 09:52.700
The bank don't see
black and white
so much as green.

09:53.667 --> 09:55.133
Hey!

09:55.200 --> 09:56.833
Daddy, come on.

09:56.900 --> 09:58.400
Them folks got every right
to make a living same
as anyone.

09:58.467 --> 10:02.100
You ain't got a goddamn
lick of sense, J.R.

10:02.167 --> 10:04.367
Once a bunch of niggers
comes in,
then 'fore you know it,

10:04.433 --> 10:06.167
this place is gonna be worth
less every year.

10:06.233 --> 10:09.067
It ain't worth less 'cause
you got negroes moving in.

10:09.133 --> 10:11.767
It's 'cause
the land is played out.

10:11.833 --> 10:14.567
-If Jack was alive...
-He'd be living
any place but here,

10:14.633 --> 10:16.500
I'd bet you that!

10:16.567 --> 10:18.467
He'd still be living
if you'd been with him
as you was supposed to be,

10:18.533 --> 10:20.967
instead of fishing'
and lollygagging' around.

10:25.367 --> 10:26.400
Ray!

10:27.800 --> 10:29.400
I don't wanna call
the law on you!

Just quit it now.

10:32.000 --> 10:34.033
I tell you, the wrong one
got killed.

10:34.100 --> 10:36.400
Ray. Just quit it now.

and you'll drop right
in the Pacific Ocean.

11:17.533 --> 11:19.967
All the way that way,
and you'll drop
into the Atlantic.

11:22.400 --> 11:24.167
Ever wonder what's 'tween
here and there?

11:28.200 --> 11:30.733
You sound like you've been
reading that...

11:30.800 --> 11:32.433
What's that thing
everyone's been reading?

11:33.500 --> 11:34.900
On the Road?

11:34.967 --> 11:37.900
-I read a little of it.
-I heard it's dirty.

11:37.967 --> 11:39.300
Maybe I should've
stuck with it.

11:42.233 --> 11:44.633
All right, east or west, babe?
Where we going?

11:44.700 --> 11:46.433
-How 'bout home?
-Home?

11:47.367 --> 11:48.867
How 'bout New York?

11:48.933 --> 11:50.767
How 'bout Hollywood?

11:50.833 --> 11:53.067
There's a big old world
out there, Trix.

11:53.100 --> 11:55.167
There's, there's nothing
here in Memphis.

11:55.233 --> 11:57.133
It's a good place
to raise a family.

11:59.100 --> 12:01.100
-Well, ain't you coming?
-You get back here!

12:01.167 --> 12:02.433
Your daddy's gonna be
mad at you.

12:02.500 --> 12:03.700
Oh, he don't care
nothin' about me.

12:03.767 --> 12:06.067
Well, your mama does.

12:22.833 --> 12:24.500
Hell, this is never
gonna work.

12:40.067 --> 12:43.333
"Our dungy Earth alike feeds
man as beast.

12:43.400 --> 12:46.267
"The nobleness of life
is to do thus."

12:47.900 --> 12:49.833
-Hmm!
-All right.

12:49.900 --> 12:53.700
I have no idea what the hell
you said, but, all right!
I think we got it!

12:53.767 --> 12:55.233
Oh, Sam!

12:59.467 --> 13:02.233
Howdy, we're

13:05.533 --> 13:10.167
Man, Clem, did we have us
a session last night.

13:10.233 --> 13:12.133
-Just now got through.
-Yeah.

13:12.200 --> 13:13.600
Now I hope you boys ain't
that crazy

13:13.667 --> 13:16.767
or I'm gonna have to tack on
a hefty clean-up charge.

13:16.833 --> 13:19.900
If you're hosing' down,
old Wichita here
could use a bath.

13:19.967 --> 13:22.333
-Wichita!
-Yeah.

13:22.400 --> 13:24.900
Well, uh, now you boys set up.

13:24.967 --> 13:26.167
All right.

13:33.800 --> 13:37.200
Hey, now, boys,
don't rush them verses
and hold back a bit.

13:37.267 --> 13:38.900
Wanna give it
a while with the chorus.

13:38.967 --> 13:41.100
Hope I patched
those cables right.

13:41.167 --> 13:42.400
Didn't you test the board?

13:42.467 --> 13:43.567
No time.

13:45.133 --> 13:46.400
You boys sitting all ready?

13:46.467 --> 13:47.533
Oh, we was born ready!

is it today, cuz?

28:19.800 --> 28:21.900
-Sunday all day.
-Sunday. Bath day.

28:21.967 --> 28:23.333
Well, that's a good deal.

28:23.400 --> 28:26.233
So how's that, uh,
studio of yours shaping up?

28:26.300 --> 28:30.967
Well, to tell you the truth,
I'm recording piss-poor
hillbilly bands and funerals.

28:31.800 --> 28:33.067
Man!

28:34.967 --> 28:38.733
Now what makes a cat like
Mr. Sam Phillips here come
all the way to Memphis?

28:38.800 --> 28:40.833
I wanna make music, man.

28:40.900 --> 28:42.933
Man, Memphis got everything.

28:43.067 --> 28:46.267
Hillbilly, big old orchestras
at the Peabody, blues straight
up from the Delta.

28:46.333 --> 28:48.300
Dear, God!
You like our colored
Rhythm 'n' Blues!

28:48.367 --> 28:51.133
No, man, the way I see it,
music ain't got no color.

28:51.200 --> 28:53.100
You open your soul to it,
and it'll...

28:53.167 --> 28:56.400
It'll make you feel like
your walking down Beale Street
on a Saturday night.

28:56.467 --> 28:57.700
Exactly, man!

28:57.767 --> 28:59.500
Man, good music is gonna find
good people.

28:59.567 --> 29:02.633
Now, I believe that
in my heart and soul.

29:02.700 --> 29:05.067
I'll tell you
what I really wanna do, man.

29:05.067 --> 29:09.233
I wanna find me songs
that I can feed to one of them
big old record companies, huh?

29:09.300 --> 29:10.667
Well, I got me a song.

29:10.733 --> 29:12.267
Yeah, it's called
Get off the Turntable, Mable.

29:12.333 --> 29:14.933
You're Too Old to Be
Running Around.

29:15.067 --> 29:17.067
What do you think
of that there, Sam?

29:17.133 --> 29:20.500
Man, I think people are gonna
be stacked up clear 'cross
Arkansas to buy it, man.

29:22.167 --> 29:23.467
Friends and neighbors,
little rabbit twisters,

29:23.533 --> 29:25.133
we've been talking

29:25.200 --> 29:27.367
Memphis Recording Service.
Go on down, see Sam.

29:27.433 --> 29:29.700

29:49.233 --> 29:51.200
So maybe I could
put you with him.

29:51.267 --> 29:55.367
He's all the time bitchin'
'bout having to record

He's got two or three records

33:04.067 --> 33:06.167
So you'll record
B.B. King for him.

33:17.267 --> 33:18.833

for setting it up,

33:18.900 --> 33:20.900

studio time money.

I can pitch to Bihari.
