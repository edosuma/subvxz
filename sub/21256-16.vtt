00:01.416 --> 00:04.006
You'd have a better change
of getting into the university

00:04.014 --> 00:05.781
if you chose a less competitive major.

00:05.816 --> 00:07.116
The point is to just get in,

00:07.151 --> 00:09.285
<i>and then, you could
always transfer into art.</i>

00:09.320 --> 00:11.760
JUDE: <i>Speaking of Mom, can we
visit her grave on Mother's Day?</i>

00:11.789 --> 00:12.921
Hey, Dad.

00:12.957 --> 00:15.169
I'm Natalie. Would you guys
like to come over for dinner?

00:15.193 --> 00:16.193
Sure.

00:16.227 --> 00:17.460
We alter some of your cells,

00:17.495 --> 00:19.573
then re-insert them into your
body to attack the cancer.

00:19.597 --> 00:20.796
- How you doing?
- Good.

00:20.831 --> 00:21.863
It seems like it.

00:21.899 --> 00:23.298
It's a meditation retreat.

00:23.333 --> 00:25.133
No excuses for not going.

00:25.228 --> 00:26.394
EMMA: <i>Drew shut down STEAM,</i>

00:26.429 --> 00:28.363
cause you crashed our drone in a tree?

00:28.398 --> 00:30.632
We're gonna keep doing STEAM off campus.

00:30.668 --> 00:32.901
We'll let you know
when and where... not.

00:32.936 --> 00:34.269
You don't have time for me,

00:34.304 --> 00:36.271
<i>but you have time to be
a roller derby manager.</i>

00:36.306 --> 00:37.805
Why not give it a try myself?

00:37.840 --> 00:39.006
MARIANA: <i>Is Tess gay?</i>

00:39.042 --> 00:40.520
Is that why she made
Logan's dad move out?

00:40.544 --> 00:41.976
TESS: <i>If you hurt him,</i>

00:42.011 --> 00:43.310
I tell you I will make sure

00:43.311 --> 00:45.146
that he doesn't want
anything to do with you.

01:16.645 --> 01:18.412
Now that you're almost a senior,

01:18.447 --> 01:19.613
I just wanted to check in,

01:19.648 --> 01:21.781
and see where your head
is at about college.

01:21.817 --> 01:25.251
Okay, well, here's my list.

01:25.286 --> 01:27.520
All top-ten in all of their categories,

01:27.555 --> 01:29.522
and top 25 over all.

01:29.557 --> 01:31.791
Yeah, these are great schools.

01:31.827 --> 01:34.928
Have you considered any
less competitive options?

01:34.963 --> 01:36.329
In addition to these?

01:37.365 --> 01:39.599
Less, um...

01:39.634 --> 01:42.335
No, I mean, well, my GPA is a 4.2,

01:42.370 --> 01:44.237
and I got a 1360 on my PSATs.

01:44.272 --> 01:45.882
Well, that can be said
about most of the students

01:45.906 --> 01:47.106
that apply to these schools.

01:47.141 --> 01:49.242
And less than 10% actually get in.

01:50.845 --> 01:52.712
Okay, but...

01:52.747 --> 01:55.013
I doubt any of those 10%

01:55.049 --> 01:56.549
are on a kick-ass roller derby team.

01:56.584 --> 02:00.052
Although, I... I haven't
quite made it on the team yet.

02:00.087 --> 02:01.164
Tryouts are this afternoon,

02:01.188 --> 02:03.555
but I'm pretty confident I'll make it.

02:03.590 --> 02:04.890
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

02:04.925 --> 02:06.959
Um, what happened with STEAM?

02:06.994 --> 02:08.227
Why'd you drop out of that?

02:09.363 --> 02:11.029
I... I didn't drop out.

02:11.065 --> 02:13.665
I... I'm just, you know, mixing it up.

02:13.700 --> 02:16.033
Colleges want to see
you stick with something.

02:16.069 --> 02:18.403
They wanna know what
you're passionate about.

02:18.438 --> 02:21.373
And there's a real need for a
diverse perspective in STEAM.

02:21.408 --> 02:22.707
If you focus on that,

02:22.743 --> 02:24.320
that could be the thing
that sets you apart.

02:24.344 --> 02:26.010
Puts you in that top 10%.

04:29.732 --> 04:31.599

04:31.634 --> 04:33.300
I expect everyone to be here.

04:33.335 --> 04:35.202
Either to defend the spot you have,

04:35.237 --> 04:37.304
or try your luck in another position.

04:37.339 --> 04:38.906

Great job, everyone.

(CHEERS)

04:44.146 --> 04:45.745
You should totally go out for jammer.

04:45.781 --> 04:46.880
You're super tough.

04:46.916 --> 04:48.315
Oh, thanks, I might.

04:50.485 --> 04:53.220
Wait, I... I thought
you wanted to block.

04:53.255 --> 04:55.688
Jammer sounds like fun, too. Why?

04:55.724 --> 04:57.690
Well, I mean, it's just...

04:57.726 --> 04:59.058
there are two spots,

04:59.093 --> 05:01.038
and Poppy and I have been
working really hard for them.

05:01.062 --> 05:02.562
Yeah.

05:02.597 --> 05:04.564
Totally cool. Blocker it is.

05:04.599 --> 05:07.266
- Congratulations.
- Yeah, you were awesome!

get some pizza to celebrate.

05:12.774 --> 05:14.441
- MARIANA: Cool.
- I wish I could.

05:14.476 --> 05:15.641
I got to work on my robot.

05:15.676 --> 05:16.775
For what?

05:16.811 --> 05:20.246
This STEAM internship over the summer.

05:20.281 --> 05:21.613
It's for the Bandt Foundation.

05:22.616 --> 05:23.649
It's super competitive.

05:23.684 --> 05:26.518
They only accept 25 students
all over the country.

05:26.554 --> 05:28.087
Do you really wanna spend

05:28.122 --> 05:30.022
the entire summer in LA, though?

05:30.058 --> 05:32.624
In Venice Beach, and uh, yeah.

05:32.660 --> 05:34.259
If I get into this program,

05:34.294 --> 05:36.094
I can pretty much go
to any college I want.

05:38.265 --> 05:39.505
When do I get to see your 'bot?

05:40.434 --> 05:42.267
- Tomorrow after school.
- Okay.

05:42.302 --> 05:45.136
Ladies, let's get
measurements for your jerseys.

05:48.976 --> 05:51.409
Hey, uh, do you think
you could work with me

05:51.445 --> 05:52.743
on my jammer tryout?

05:52.779 --> 05:55.546
Yeah, sure, but you and Mariana
are the best contenders we got.

05:55.582 --> 05:58.483
Yeah, I just I want it so much,

05:58.518 --> 06:01.286
and Ximena's not convinced
that I'm jammer material,

06:01.321 --> 06:03.788
so I really got to kill it.

06:03.823 --> 06:05.055
Okay, I'll work with you,

06:05.091 --> 06:06.757
but don't worry. You got this.

06:14.100 --> 06:15.299
Going somewhere?

06:15.334 --> 06:16.667
Uh, yeah.

06:16.703 --> 06:18.302
Grace and I got a gig opening

06:18.337 --> 06:20.705
for Someone's Little Sister
at one of their shows.

06:20.740 --> 06:23.207
and since Grace's mom
is gonna be out of town,

06:23.242 --> 06:24.419
we're just gonna spend the weekend

06:24.443 --> 06:25.443
working on our set.

06:26.445 --> 06:28.078
"Working on your set."

06:28.114 --> 06:30.381
Is that what the kids
are calling it these days?

06:30.416 --> 06:32.483
No, seriously, this is...

06:32.518 --> 06:34.151
super important to her.

06:34.186 --> 06:35.919
It's something she's
always wanted to do.

06:38.690 --> 06:42.091
So when will you find out
if the gene therapy worked?

06:42.127 --> 06:44.360
Uh, a few weeks.

06:44.396 --> 06:47.731
But you know, she's feeling
really good right now.

06:47.766 --> 06:49.399
- Good.
- Yeah.

06:56.141 --> 06:57.806
Hey.

06:57.842 --> 07:00.276
Are we gonna, uh...

07:00.311 --> 07:02.211
Are you gonna drive us
to dinner tomorrow night?

07:03.248 --> 07:05.648
With Donald and his...

07:05.683 --> 07:06.782
Natalie?

07:06.817 --> 07:09.318
Alright, um...

07:09.354 --> 07:12.555
Listen, is it cool if
you just go without me?

07:13.558 --> 07:14.757
What? Why?

07:14.792 --> 07:16.825
I... I have a lot of homework and stuff.

07:16.861 --> 07:18.027
Come on, Callie.

07:18.062 --> 07:20.429
I really want to go, and...

07:20.464 --> 07:22.330
it'll be weird if I'm alone.

07:25.069 --> 07:26.268
Please?

07:31.675 --> 07:33.442
Whatcha reading?

07:33.477 --> 07:35.143
The news.

07:35.179 --> 07:37.379
Everything's so bleak.

07:37.414 --> 07:38.980
It's like the damn world is ending.

07:39.015 --> 07:41.283
Well, it's not a good idea
to read this stuff before bed.

07:41.318 --> 07:42.584
Hey.

07:42.619 --> 07:45.219
Better to do something
like, you know, this.

07:45.254 --> 07:46.721
- Hmm.
- (KISS)

07:47.958 --> 07:49.924
Or a little of this.

07:51.595 --> 07:55.196
- Or this.
- Stop, stop. I'm just not in the mood, love.

07:59.435 --> 08:00.568
Okay.

08:03.672 --> 08:06.940
So, have you thought any more about

08:06.976 --> 08:08.875
going on that couple's
retreat your mom gave us?

08:08.911 --> 08:11.878
- She did pay for it.
- (SCOFFS) Seriously?

08:11.914 --> 08:13.925
It's just gonna be a bunch
of old hippies running around

08:13.949 --> 08:15.116
doing breathing circles,

08:15.151 --> 08:16.417
and naked hikes.

08:16.452 --> 08:18.619
Or it's time away.

08:18.654 --> 08:20.553
Just the two of us.

08:20.589 --> 08:21.622
I looked it up online,

08:21.657 --> 08:23.289
and the grounds are absolutely gorgeous.

08:23.325 --> 08:25.003
And we don't have to do
anything we don't wanna do.

08:25.027 --> 08:26.994
What? So we go, and
we don't participate?

08:27.029 --> 08:28.461
Now we're the weirdos.

08:28.497 --> 08:31.364
Don't worry about it.
I will talk to my mom.

08:31.399 --> 08:32.943
Tell that we're just...
we're not interested,

08:32.967 --> 08:35.368
and tell her that she should
try to get money back, you know?

09:13.474 --> 09:16.408
Bad news. My ghost is back.

09:16.443 --> 09:18.143
(LAUGHS)

09:26.050 --> 09:29.905
So, I've had this ghost off
and on since I was a kid,

09:29.950 --> 09:31.816
and he's not, like, always around,

09:31.852 --> 09:32.951
but he's back now.

09:35.789 --> 09:37.321
You think I'm nuts, right?

09:37.357 --> 09:38.689
No, no, I...

09:39.726 --> 09:41.159
A little, but...

09:41.194 --> 09:44.929
I'm sorry. The last thing I
wanna do is ruin this weekend.

09:44.965 --> 09:47.999
So, can you, uh... see it?

09:48.034 --> 09:50.201
No. No, he... he's more of a presence.

09:50.237 --> 09:51.802
He? Oh, so it's a he.

09:51.837 --> 09:53.571
- I'm pretty sure. Yeah.
- Hmm.

09:53.606 --> 09:56.206
Well, is he friendly like Casper?

09:56.242 --> 09:57.408
(SNICKERS)

09:59.211 --> 10:02.880
You know what? I probably
shouldn't have said anything. I'm...

10:02.915 --> 10:04.348
Let's just practice. Forget it.

10:04.384 --> 10:05.816
What? Grace, look. I wasn't...

10:05.851 --> 10:08.085
No, it's fine. Just forget it.

- Hi!
- This is really nice.

10:24.836 --> 10:26.969
- Thank you! Thank you.
- Yeah, this is...

10:27.005 --> 10:28.938
- all Natalie here.
- Oh, come on, you helped!

10:28.973 --> 10:30.652
No, I know, but it's your
place, I don't live here.

10:30.676 --> 10:31.775
Yeah, although you should.

10:31.810 --> 10:33.730
Considering you're here
practically all the time.

10:36.080 --> 10:38.147
Dinner is almost ready.

10:38.183 --> 10:40.583

- Oh, thanks. Caleb!

- Nice to meet you.

10:47.792 --> 10:49.192
- Hi.
- Hey.

11:07.345 --> 11:09.578
Your shoes were in the
middle of the foyer again.

11:09.613 --> 11:10.946
Someone could trip over them...

11:10.981 --> 11:12.214
like me, just now.

11:12.249 --> 11:13.882
- (SHOES CLATTER)

STEAM internship in Venice Beach

11:17.988 --> 11:19.454
if I get accepted?

11:19.489 --> 11:22.068
Yeah, I don't see why not as long
as it doesn't cost a ton of money.

11:22.092 --> 11:23.491
All expenses paid.

11:23.526 --> 11:25.994
Well, hell, sign me up.

11:26.029 --> 11:28.763
Oh, by the way, Logan's
coming over later to study.

11:28.798 --> 11:31.499
Wait, you did not talk to
him about Tess, did you?

11:31.534 --> 11:32.633
Oh, no.

11:32.669 --> 11:34.309
Definitely not after
what Tess said to me.

11:35.204 --> 11:36.437
What did Tess say to you?

11:37.940 --> 11:39.707
Well, she, uh...

11:39.743 --> 11:41.476
sorta, kinda threatened

11:41.511 --> 11:44.011
to forbid Logan from seeing
me if I said anything.

11:48.885 --> 11:51.952
Donald has told us
so much about you two.

11:51.988 --> 11:54.388
Oh, yeah? Like what?

11:54.423 --> 11:58.792
I... mostly things, uh,
from when you were little.

11:58.827 --> 12:00.727
Um...

12:00.763 --> 12:02.096
What are you up to now?

12:03.199 --> 12:05.164
Not much.

12:05.200 --> 12:07.667
- He's a gamer.
- What's that?

12:08.804 --> 12:12.406
This company pays him to
play their video games.

12:12.441 --> 12:13.774
Oh, that's cool!

12:13.809 --> 12:15.609
They pay you to do that?

12:15.644 --> 12:17.110
Uh, yeah.

12:17.145 --> 12:19.846
- Wow!
- Uh, you game at all?

12:19.882 --> 12:22.548
Not really. I'm mostly into sports.

12:22.583 --> 12:24.483
Baseball, basketball, soccer.

12:24.519 --> 12:26.953
- DONALD: Yeah, he's a really great athlete.
- NATALIE: Yeah!

12:26.988 --> 12:28.687
Sometimes I feel like
more of a chauffeur,

12:28.723 --> 12:30.935
because I'm just driving him
around to all of his events,

12:30.959 --> 12:32.758
but Donald helps out a lot.

12:35.897 --> 12:39.031
And you, you're a...
you're a senior, right?

12:39.066 --> 12:41.333
Where you thinking about next year?

12:41.368 --> 12:43.803
Oh, well, I applied to a few colleges.

12:43.838 --> 12:46.104
- Mm. Which ones?
- Cool.

12:47.107 --> 12:48.407
Sonoma State,

12:48.443 --> 12:49.675
Portland State...

12:49.710 --> 12:53.211
And UCSD. The art program.

12:53.247 --> 12:55.047
Great. You hear back from any?

12:56.050 --> 12:57.549
I got into Portland.

12:57.584 --> 12:59.784
- Cool!
- Congratulations!

12:59.820 --> 13:02.154
UCSD's her first choice though.

13:02.189 --> 13:03.989
She's an amazing artist.

13:04.024 --> 13:05.690
- NATALIE: Mm.
- That's cool.

13:05.725 --> 13:09.461
I like to draw, but I'm not that good.

13:09.496 --> 13:11.228
That's not true, you got the um...

13:11.264 --> 13:13.443
- Your blue ribbon.
- The ribbon at the contest at school.

13:13.467 --> 13:14.499
Honorable mention.

13:14.534 --> 13:17.635
Yeah, well it's... it's
not nothing. I mean, it...

13:23.510 --> 13:24.943
So where's your dad?

13:26.379 --> 13:31.915
Um, Caleb's father and I
divorced when he was very little.

13:31.951 --> 13:34.085
He's not really into being a dad.

13:34.120 --> 13:36.820
Yeah, that sucks when that happens.

13:48.669 --> 13:50.225
It is one thing if she
doesn't want to tell Dean,

13:50.226 --> 13:51.390
but to threaten Mariana?

13:51.398 --> 13:52.597
I don't like it either.

13:52.632 --> 13:54.565
Well, I'm going over there...

13:54.601 --> 13:56.100
Lena, please.

13:56.135 --> 13:59.303
Why are you so obsessed with
the Bayfield's personal business?

13:59.338 --> 14:02.272
- (DOOR CLOSES)
- Um, so you didn't bring any books...

14:02.308 --> 14:04.008
to a study date.

14:04.043 --> 14:06.611
Well, I figured you got the
study part down and, um...

14:06.646 --> 14:07.979
I got the date part.

14:08.014 --> 14:09.413
Mm.

14:11.783 --> 14:15.352
I am not obsessed, I have tried
very hard to stay out of this.

14:15.387 --> 14:18.288
But Tess keeps dragging this
whole family into it and I...

14:18.324 --> 14:19.889
You are letting yourself be dragged.

14:19.925 --> 14:21.225
No, I am not!

14:21.260 --> 14:23.727
Why does it bother you so much
that Tess might be a lesbian?

14:28.433 --> 14:30.734
It's got a lot of crazy rules
and characters and stuff,

14:30.769 --> 14:32.769
but once you figure
it out, it's super fun.

14:32.804 --> 14:36.840
So, you and that guy are...
I've heard of gamers before,

14:36.875 --> 14:38.608
but you're "gay-mers"?

14:38.644 --> 14:42.178
Yeah. My dad didn't tell you I was gay?

14:42.213 --> 14:44.447
No, but it's cool.

14:45.783 --> 14:49.585
We went to Hawaii over
Christmas. You ever been?

14:53.158 --> 14:55.758
I thought we could
have dessert out here.

14:55.793 --> 14:57.293
Such a lovely night.

14:57.328 --> 14:59.895
- Can I help?
- No. No, I've got it covered.

14:59.930 --> 15:02.665
- You guys visit, I'll bring it out.
- Great. Thank you.

15:07.772 --> 15:09.571
- She's nice.
- Yeah.

15:09.606 --> 15:11.707
Yeah, she's a good... good person.

15:11.742 --> 15:13.508
How long have you been seeing her?

15:14.545 --> 15:16.010
About a year, I guess.

15:17.247 --> 15:19.514
Sounds like she wants
you to move in here.

15:19.550 --> 15:20.982
Yep.

15:23.053 --> 15:26.087
I notice you're not wearing
your mom's locket, huh?

15:26.122 --> 15:29.191
Oh, yeah. Um, took it off.

15:29.226 --> 15:31.326
My friend gave me this.

15:31.361 --> 15:32.827
It's pretty.

15:34.130 --> 15:38.733
All right, so tell me all about
art school. You must be excited.

15:41.470 --> 15:43.537
- What?
- I didn't get in.

15:44.640 --> 15:46.974
Um, but I haven't told anyone yet.

15:47.010 --> 15:49.976
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- No, it's fine. I didn't think I would.

15:50.012 --> 15:53.347
Oh, still you... you
must be disappointed.

15:53.382 --> 15:54.981
Well, yeah, but...

15:56.118 --> 15:59.620
Yeah, I try not to
want anything too much.

16:01.790 --> 16:04.491
It's okay, you know. I
can go to Portland State.

16:04.527 --> 16:05.892
You know?

16:05.928 --> 16:08.729
They don't have an art
program like UCSD's but...

16:08.764 --> 16:12.132
Well, how do you feel
about going out of state?

16:12.167 --> 16:13.499
Fine.

16:13.535 --> 16:16.103
I hear Portland's
supposed to be a cool town.

16:16.138 --> 16:17.303
So...

16:17.339 --> 16:19.072
at least I got in somewhere.

I think it's too sentimental.

Maybe it needs more

16:54.041 --> 16:55.574
No, I... I don't think so.

16:55.609 --> 16:57.041
You know, maybe our whole set does.

16:57.077 --> 16:58.577
We should just start over.

16:58.612 --> 16:59.940
I mean, how many
chances are we gonna get

16:59.941 --> 17:01.625
to actually open up for a legit band?

17:01.649 --> 17:04.848
Uh, I don't think we have enough
time to write a whole new set.

17:04.885 --> 17:08.987

Well, I mean that part is true.

17:22.169 --> 17:24.367
But it's not you being terrible. Okay?

17:33.379 --> 17:34.645
What?

17:34.681 --> 17:36.514
I feel like the ghost is watching.

17:36.549 --> 17:38.849
Well, maybe that's his thing.

17:38.884 --> 17:42.019
Yeah, you know what?

wasting our alone time and why?

nothing supernatural about it.

understand then just...

like, nervous about the gig?

18:19.190 --> 18:21.991
Is that why you're
sabotaging everything?

18:22.026 --> 18:23.804
I mean, why did this ghost
suddenly come back now?

18:23.828 --> 18:24.994
I don't know!

18:36.507 --> 18:38.507
That's allowed.

18:38.542 --> 18:42.344
I'm scared because I only
feel him when I'm sick.

18:45.182 --> 18:46.982
What if I'm still sick?

18:53.557 --> 18:56.020
So the first time I sensed him,

18:56.316 --> 19:00.518
I was nine when I went to the
hospital for the first time.

19:00.553 --> 19:02.854
And then he came back the
second time when I was thirteen.

19:02.889 --> 19:06.157
And last week when
they put the T cells in.

19:07.227 --> 19:11.129
And what does it feel
like, this, uh... presence?

19:12.365 --> 19:14.132
It's kind of like a heaviness.

19:15.635 --> 19:19.036
But he's never come home with me before

19:19.071 --> 19:22.039
and that's why I'm freaking
out. I mean, maybe... maybe...

19:22.074 --> 19:25.075
maybe the treatment isn't working.
Maybe he knows I'm still sick.

19:26.246 --> 19:29.813
Or maybe he knows you
aren't sick anymore.

19:29.849 --> 19:33.450
Otherwise he'd just wait for you
to get back to the hospital, right?

19:34.453 --> 19:36.654
Suddenly you're an
expert in ghost rules?

19:36.689 --> 19:38.122
Well, maybe he followed you home

19:38.157 --> 19:41.091
because he knows that you're never
gonna go back to the hospital.

19:41.127 --> 19:44.194
Okay, so he's just gonna
hang around here from now on?

19:45.730 --> 19:47.964
No, but I mean, what if he's, you know,

19:47.999 --> 19:51.868
ready to move on but
he needs you to help.

19:51.903 --> 19:55.071
You know, like help him go
to the light or whatever.

19:56.175 --> 19:58.608
I thought you didn't believe in ghosts.

19:58.644 --> 20:01.510
Just because I can't feel him
doesn't mean he's not here.

20:05.416 --> 20:06.716
Okay.

20:06.751 --> 20:09.418
Well, then if that's the case,

20:09.453 --> 20:10.987
what do we do?

20:12.557 --> 20:15.992
We help him, right?

20:17.995 --> 20:19.461
Yeah.

20:25.469 --> 20:27.236
So we're done talking about this?

20:27.271 --> 20:29.275
You know what? There's
nothing to talk about.

20:29.276 --> 20:30.772

or a unicorn, I just wish...

- Good job.

20:39.116 --> 20:41.216
Thanks to you, Logan now
knows his mom is a lesbian.

20:42.352 --> 20:44.352
- Oh, no.
- I told you he was coming over.

20:44.387 --> 20:45.987
You couldn't have kept your voices down?

20:46.023 --> 20:48.223
He looked like he just
got punched in the stomach

20:48.258 --> 20:49.768
and then he told me
he needed to go home.

20:49.792 --> 20:52.553
It would have been so much better
if I just told him like I wanted to.

21:03.440 --> 21:05.506
Hey, what are you...

21:05.542 --> 21:07.141
I was looking for Jesus.

21:07.176 --> 21:09.243
Are... are you applying to this?

21:09.278 --> 21:12.213
Well, I was thinking about it.

21:12.248 --> 21:15.549
Well... you can't.

21:16.552 --> 21:18.986
Why not? I mean, what if we both get it?

21:19.021 --> 21:21.133
How cool would it be to spend
the whole summer together in L.A.?

21:21.157 --> 21:23.306
Yeah, I told you it's one of the most

21:23.307 --> 21:25.892
competitive high school
internships in the country.

21:25.927 --> 21:27.310
There's no way that
they're going to accept

21:27.311 --> 21:28.840
two students from the same city,

21:28.864 --> 21:30.530
let alone the same high school.

21:30.566 --> 21:32.335
Well, our college counselor said

21:32.336 --> 21:33.900
I needed more STEAM stuff on my résumé.

21:33.935 --> 21:35.602
Then come back to STEAM club.

21:35.638 --> 21:37.537
You don't have to
apply for my internship.

21:37.573 --> 21:40.240
Oh, you mean the STEAM club that
you basically kicked me out of?

21:40.275 --> 21:42.275
That is not exactly how that went down.

21:42.310 --> 21:44.521
Sorry, and by the way, since
when is this your internship?

21:44.545 --> 21:46.479
Because I'm the one
who told you about it.

21:46.514 --> 21:47.814
This is my thing.

21:47.849 --> 21:49.382
Okay, well derby's my thing

21:49.417 --> 21:51.262
and I didn't have a problem
with you joining that.

21:51.286 --> 21:52.485
This is different.

21:52.520 --> 21:55.454
Okay, well I'm sorry but it's
not fair for you to tell me

21:55.490 --> 21:57.200
I can't apply to something
just because you are.

21:57.224 --> 21:58.591
Hey.

21:58.626 --> 22:00.660
What happened to you today?

22:00.695 --> 22:02.261
Um...

22:02.297 --> 22:04.730
You were supposed to come
over to look at my robot?

22:04.766 --> 22:07.700
Oh. Damn it. Um...

22:07.735 --> 22:08.970
I'm sorry. I was...

22:08.971 --> 22:11.870
I was helping Poppy get
ready for her jammer tryout.

22:11.906 --> 22:13.906
I totally spaced.

22:13.941 --> 22:16.175
Yeah, well I needed your help today too

22:16.210 --> 22:17.754
but I guess I'm not a priority anymore.

22:17.778 --> 22:18.811
Got it.

22:26.987 --> 22:29.921
- How are your moms?
- Good. They're good.

want anything too much.

a family and you got one.

22:46.472 --> 22:47.872
Yeah.

22:47.907 --> 22:52.910
Yeah. I know your... your
mom dying so suddenly,

22:52.946 --> 22:57.048
to be blindsided by that,
you want to protect yourself.

didn't get in to art school?

23:04.790 --> 23:06.156
Think...

23:08.461 --> 23:13.330
maybe I didn't let myself want it enough

23:13.366 --> 23:16.667
and maybe they sensed that.

23:18.871 --> 23:21.972
Even though you did.

23:22.007 --> 23:26.035

No. No, he's nowhere in the house.

goodbye? That's so rude!

All this time, I just assumed
that Donald didn't reach out to us

24:47.646 --> 24:49.145
because he was too depressed

24:49.153 --> 24:51.541
or something about what he did to Mom.

24:51.576 --> 24:55.211
It turns out he was just
too busy with his new family.

24:55.247 --> 24:59.215
Yeah, Donald should have
reached out to us. Absolutely.

25:13.731 --> 25:16.098
- Jude, come on. I...
- You're going to Portland.

25:17.501 --> 25:19.301

36:29.501 --> 36:32.302
I mean, after everything that
she's been through with her parents,

36:32.337 --> 36:34.271
she needed this.

36:34.306 --> 36:35.772
What about what I need?

36:35.807 --> 36:37.474
What, you need to be jammer?

36:39.077 --> 36:40.409
No.

36:47.852 --> 36:49.418
I don't want to be jammer.

36:49.453 --> 36:50.519
Why not?

36:50.554 --> 36:51.988
I want Poppy to have it.

36:52.023 --> 36:54.790
She's not gonna want
something she didn't earn.

36:54.825 --> 36:56.492
That's not how this team works.

36:56.527 --> 36:59.395
Okay, we compete against
ourselves, not each other.

36:59.430 --> 37:01.764
We empower our sister to do her best,

37:01.799 --> 37:04.132
even if her best is better than ours,

37:04.168 --> 37:06.302
because we're badasses here.

37:06.337 --> 37:08.370
You have nothing to feel bad about.

37:11.474 --> 37:12.874
I'm sorry.

37:14.077 --> 37:15.410
Don't be.

37:16.680 --> 37:17.979
You earned it.

37:23.653 --> 37:25.420
Apply for the internship.

37:25.455 --> 37:27.055
It's cool.

37:32.662 --> 37:35.396
Helen! Hi.

37:36.399 --> 37:37.432
Do you have a minute?

37:37.467 --> 37:38.800
Yeah, of course.

37:38.835 --> 37:42.169
So I got my rejection letter.

37:42.205 --> 37:43.938
Yes, I'm sorry it didn't work out.

37:43.973 --> 37:46.707
Yeah, I want to appeal the decision.

37:46.742 --> 37:48.309
That's something I can do, right?

37:48.344 --> 37:51.378
Yeah, but you should know that
very few appeals are successful.

37:51.413 --> 37:55.316
Okay, I want to try.

37:55.351 --> 37:59.353
Yeah, I realized that in my
application and my portfolio,

37:59.388 --> 38:03.022
I was holding back a little.

38:03.058 --> 38:06.131
I just don't think that
I showed just how much

38:06.132 --> 38:09.430
I really want to be
a part of this program

38:09.465 --> 38:11.998
and I'd love another
chance to prove that.

38:12.033 --> 38:15.268
Well, I have seen you struggle
to put yourself out there.

38:15.303 --> 38:17.636
And I promise I am working on that.

38:17.672 --> 38:19.072
But can I be frank with you?

38:20.075 --> 38:21.875
Sure.

38:21.910 --> 38:22.910
The reason you didn't
get in to the program

38:22.915 --> 38:26.059
wasn't because you
didn't want it enough.

38:26.081 --> 38:29.349
And it definitely wasn't
because you lack the talent.

38:29.384 --> 38:34.420
It's because the passion, the fire
I see you have for helping Ximena,

38:34.455 --> 38:35.815
that's what's missing in your art.

38:36.758 --> 38:38.090
But I can fix that, right?

38:38.125 --> 38:40.760
Maybe, or maybe you shouldn't fix it.

38:40.795 --> 38:43.629
Maybe you should go where
the fire is already stoked.

38:44.932 --> 38:46.465
What do you mean?

38:46.501 --> 38:50.535
I mean... maybe art
isn't your true calling.

39:03.384 --> 39:05.050
(KNOCKING)

39:06.853 --> 39:08.152
Is Stef here?

39:08.187 --> 39:09.788
(SIGHS) Why?

39:09.823 --> 39:11.623
Because my son is very upset

39:11.658 --> 39:12.891
and I need to speak with her.

39:12.926 --> 39:14.392
No.

39:14.428 --> 39:15.727
Excuse me?

39:15.762 --> 39:18.173
You're not talking to my wife,
you're not talking to my daughter,

39:18.197 --> 39:20.565
or anyone else who you're
trying to drag into your mess.

39:20.600 --> 39:24.135
You need to keep your business
on your side of the fence.

39:24.170 --> 39:27.939
And if you want to come out,
you need to do that by yourself.

39:27.974 --> 39:30.241
We have got...

39:30.276 --> 39:33.978
(SIGHS) our own problems
to deal with in this house.

39:34.013 --> 39:35.712
So just please leave us alone.

39:37.317 --> 39:40.551
Yeah, okay. Sorry.

39:53.298 --> 39:55.131
<i>♪ Yeah, that's my love ♪</i>

39:57.970 --> 40:00.270
(LENA BREATHES SHAKILY)

40:01.906 --> 40:03.906

40:07.579 --> 40:10.613
<i>♪ Does she know everything I say ♪</i>

40:10.648 --> 40:14.350
You have... you have feelings for her?

40:15.753 --> 40:17.052
No.

40:18.889 --> 40:20.789
I don't, I have...

40:23.426 --> 40:26.260
I have feelings about her...

40:27.865 --> 40:29.130
about me.

40:30.133 --> 40:32.233
What about? What... what about?

40:32.268 --> 40:34.669
About everything. My life.

40:36.373 --> 40:39.740
(SIGHS) Are you not happy with our life?

40:39.775 --> 40:40.941
That's not it.

40:45.281 --> 40:47.248
I'm unhappy with me.

40:50.586 --> 40:51.919
Let's just go away.

40:51.954 --> 40:54.555
Let's do the couples thing, the
retreat that my mother got us.

40:55.558 --> 40:56.790
(SIGHS)

40:57.894 --> 40:59.092
Please?
