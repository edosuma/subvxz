- WEDNESDAY.

01:13.874 --> 01:15.343
- AND THE HOT LATINO?

01:15.376 --> 01:16.877
- THURSDAY.
- WELL, OLE, TEDDY.

01:16.910 --> 01:19.180
YOU ARE OUT OF CONTROL.

01:19.213 --> 01:21.449
- GOOD EVENING, TWATS.

01:21.482 --> 01:22.850
- WOULD YOU
KINDLY REFRAIN

01:22.883 --> 01:24.585
FROM USING DEROGATORY
REFERENCES TO WOMEN

01:24.618 --> 01:26.487
SINCE THEY REPRESENT
HALF OF MY FAN-BASE?

01:26.520 --> 01:28.656
- HAVE ANY HERMAPHRODITES?

01:28.689 --> 01:30.724
- I DON'T THINK SO.
- GOOD.

01:30.758 --> 01:32.493
GO FUCK YOURSELF.
- [chuckles]

01:32.526 --> 01:34.195
- ANYBODY HERE WORTH DOING?

01:34.228 --> 01:35.863
- NO, SORRY, BRI.
ALREADY DONE THEM.

01:35.896 --> 01:38.132
- OH, WE WERE UP TO FRIDAY.

01:38.166 --> 01:40.201
- OH, UH, THERE'S FRIDAY
OVER THERE.

01:40.234 --> 01:41.535
THE BOSSY BOTTOM
OVER THERE.

01:41.569 --> 01:43.237
- HE'S A BOTTOM?
- YEAH.

01:43.271 --> 01:44.905
YOU SHOULD HEAR HIM
SING NATURAL WOMAN.

01:44.938 --> 01:46.340
BETTER THAN ARETHA,
I MIGHT ADD.

01:46.374 --> 01:47.741
- YOU'VE GOT TO GAG THEM FIRST,

01:47.775 --> 01:49.877
THEN FUCK 'EM.

01:49.910 --> 01:52.546
YOU STILL HAVE MUCH TO LEARN,
THEODORE.

01:52.580 --> 01:54.282
- OH MY GOD.
WHO'S THAT?

01:54.315 --> 02:02.256
*

02:10.664 --> 02:14.402
- I DON'T KNOW, BUT I BELIEVE
I HAVE SUNDAY FREE.

02:14.435 --> 02:16.370
- COUNT ON STAYING HOME

02:16.404 --> 02:19.207
AND TRIMMING YOUR PUBES.

02:23.277 --> 02:25.413
- I'LL LET HIM
HAVE THIS ONE.

02:25.446 --> 02:28.649

03:28.376 --> 03:31.345
[men moaning]

03:48.362 --> 03:51.265
- WOW! RAGE AND J.T. ARE FINALLY
TYING THE KNOT.

03:51.299 --> 03:52.500
- IT'S ABOUT TIME,
WOULDN'T YOU SAY?

03:52.533 --> 03:53.934
- DID THEY GO
TO TORONTO?

03:53.967 --> 03:56.504
- NO. MASSACHUPITER.
IT'S A PLANET.

03:56.537 --> 03:57.938
- UNLIKE PENNSYLVANIA,

03:57.971 --> 03:59.507
IT'S LEGAL FOR GAYS
TO GET MARRIED THERE.

03:59.540 --> 04:00.874
- AHA!

04:00.908 --> 04:01.942
SO, WHERE DO WE BUY
OUR ROCKET SHIP TICKETS

04:01.975 --> 04:03.344
AND ZOOM OFF?

04:03.377 --> 04:04.612
- HUH. I WISH!

04:04.645 --> 04:05.746
- WELL, UNTIL WE CAN,

04:05.779 --> 04:07.381
WE'LL JUST LIVE
VICARIOUSLY

04:07.415 --> 04:09.383
THROUGH OUR
INTREPID SUPERHEROES.

04:09.417 --> 04:11.652
- LET'S HOPE THAT
5,000 READERS--

04:11.685 --> 04:13.053
OH, WHAT THE HELL,
MAKE IT 10--

04:13.086 --> 04:14.888
AGREE WITH YOU.

04:14.922 --> 04:16.357
- I'LL GET THESE
OUT OF YOUR WAY.

04:16.390 --> 04:18.058
- YOU COMING TO
OUR HOUSEWARMING?

04:18.091 --> 04:19.660
- I WOULDN'T MISS IT.

04:19.693 --> 04:22.396
- IT'S GOING TO BE
A BAD-ASS BLOW-OUT.

04:22.430 --> 04:23.497
- WHAT DO YOU SAY
WE START EARLY?

04:23.531 --> 04:26.467
- MM.
- MM-HMM.

04:29.537 --> 04:31.639
[door closes]

04:31.672 --> 04:33.374
HERE HE IS.

04:33.407 --> 04:35.576
- OUR WAYWARD SON.

04:35.609 --> 04:36.577
- COOL COVER.

04:36.610 --> 04:38.045
- WHERE'VE YOU BEEN?

04:38.078 --> 04:39.580
- I THOUGHT YOU WERE GOING
TO BE HOME BY 6:00.

04:39.613 --> 04:41.081
- I WAS PRACTICING WITH
MY DEBATING PARTNER.

04:41.114 --> 04:42.916
- [chuckles] WHENEVER I USED
TO TELL MY PARENTS THAT,

04:42.950 --> 04:44.652
I WAS USUALLY
GETTING STONED.

04:44.685 --> 04:46.787
- WHEN'S THE BIG EVENT?

04:46.820 --> 04:48.055
- UH, TOMORROW AFTERNOON.

04:48.088 --> 04:49.690
IT'S IN FRONT OF
THE WHOLE SCHOOL.

04:49.723 --> 04:50.991
- WHAT'S THE TOPIC?

04:51.024 --> 04:52.092
- CAPITAL PUNISHMENT.

04:52.125 --> 04:53.527
I'M ALL FOR IT.

04:53.561 --> 04:56.530
I SAY FRY
THE MOTHERFUCKERS.

04:56.564 --> 04:58.532
- NOW YOU SEE WHY
WE'RE SO PROUD.

04:58.566 --> 05:00.000
- [laughs]

05:00.033 --> 05:01.702
- NOW, WHAT I'M
ABOUT TO SHOW YOU

05:01.735 --> 05:03.070
MAY FRIGHTEN
SMALL CHILDREN,

05:03.103 --> 05:04.938
SO PARENTS MAY WANT THEM
TO LEAVE THE ROOM.

05:04.972 --> 05:07.107
[chuckles]
SCARY, HUH?

05:07.140 --> 05:10.411
IT'S WHAT I CALL
THE "COMB-OVER"

05:10.444 --> 05:11.879
LIKE WALLY'S HERE.

05:11.912 --> 05:14.548
BUT SEE HOW MUCH HOTTER
WALLY LOOKS

05:14.582 --> 05:16.850
WHEN HE EMBRACES
HIS BALDNESS.

05:16.884 --> 05:19.086
WH--WHY, WALLACE,

05:19.119 --> 05:20.688
IS THAT A HICKEY?

05:20.721 --> 05:23.090
GO FOR IT, TIGER.
[growls, laughs]

05:23.123 --> 05:26.093
ALL RIGHT. THOSE ARE MY
HAIR DOs AND DON'Ts.

05:26.126 --> 05:27.961
NEXT WEEK, HOME WAXING.

05:27.995 --> 05:29.563
AND I'M NOT TALKING
ABOUT THE KITCHEN FLOOR.

05:29.597 --> 05:33.734
OKAY, EVERYBODY,
BE FABULOUS!

05:33.767 --> 05:36.136
- THANKS, QUEER GUY.
THAT'S IT FOR TONIGHT.

05:36.169 --> 05:39.573
HOPEFULLY,
WE'LL BE "HAIR" TOMORROW.

05:39.607 --> 05:42.443
- MAY ALL YOUR NEWS
BE GOOD NEWS.

05:42.476 --> 05:44.445
- AND WE'RE OUT.

05:44.478 --> 05:46.514
- THANK YOU SO MUCH.

05:46.547 --> 05:48.616
- THAT WAS FABULOUS!
- AW.

05:48.649 --> 05:49.717
- SEE? YOU'VE EVEN
GOT ME DOING IT.

05:49.750 --> 05:51.118
- SORRY, DON.

05:51.151 --> 05:52.486
- SORRY? SINCE YOU'VE BEEN
ON THE AIR,

05:52.520 --> 05:53.854
THE RATINGS HAVE
GONE UP TWO POINTS.

05:53.887 --> 05:55.989
NOW EVERYBODY WANTS
THE QUEER PERSPECTIVE.

05:56.023 --> 05:59.126
CHANNEL NINE HAS EVEN HIRED
A TRANNY WEATHER, UH, PERSON.

05:59.159 --> 06:01.762
- WELL, LET'S JUST HOPE
HE-SHE CAN DECIDE

06:01.795 --> 06:03.664
IF IT'S GOING TO BE
RAINY OR FAIR.

06:03.697 --> 06:04.932
- EITHER WAY, YOUR FANS
ARE GOING TO BE

06:04.965 --> 06:06.133
LINED UP AROUND THE BLOCK
TO SEE YOU

06:06.166 --> 06:07.501
TOMORROW AT HOFFMAN'S.

06:07.535 --> 06:09.002
- SO MANY IN NEED,
SO LITTLE TIME.

06:09.036 --> 06:12.640
- AND WAIT TILL
YOU READ YOUR...FAN MAIL.

06:12.673 --> 06:14.875
- FAN MAIL? FOR ME?

06:14.908 --> 06:19.379
- EVEN PEOPLE
WHO HATE FAGS LOVE YOU.

06:21.915 --> 06:24.818
- HERE YOU GO, HON.
- OH.

06:24.852 --> 06:27.054
OH, THANK YOU, CARL,
BUT...

06:27.087 --> 06:31.792
HONESTLY, I DON'T THINK
I COULD KEEP IT DOWN.

06:31.825 --> 06:33.661
- ARE YOU STILL HURTING?
- [whimpers]

06:33.694 --> 06:36.196
- POOR BABY.

06:36.229 --> 06:38.499
DID YOU TAKE WHAT
DR. MACGRATH PRESCRIBED?

06:38.532 --> 06:39.767
- THAT QUACK?

06:39.800 --> 06:40.934
HE OUGHT TO BE
SPLIT AND QUARTERED

06:40.968 --> 06:42.836
AND SERVED WITH
ORANGE SAUCE.

06:42.870 --> 06:46.807
OH, HONEY...

06:46.840 --> 06:48.576
I MEAN, THERE ARE
ALL THESE NEW DISEASES.

06:48.609 --> 06:52.112
YOU KNOW, DAMN DOCTORS
CAN'T KEEP UP WITH IT.

06:52.145 --> 06:53.714
HMM.

06:53.747 --> 06:56.584
WHAT IF IT'S MAD COW
OR THAT BIRD FLU?

06:56.617 --> 06:57.951
COME TO THINK OF IT,

06:57.985 --> 06:59.520
A PIGEON SHIT ON MY SHOULDER
THE OTHER DAY.

06:59.553 --> 07:00.788
I'VE GOT TO REMEMBER
TO TELL THAT

07:00.821 --> 07:02.723
TO THE NEW DOCTOR.
- NEW DOCTOR?

07:02.756 --> 07:05.993
- I'M GETTING
A SECOND OPINION.

07:06.026 --> 07:07.828
ACTUALLY, IT'S MORE
LIKE A FOURTH.

07:07.861 --> 07:09.830
- OKAY, THAT'S IT.

07:12.633 --> 07:14.868
- WHO'RE YOU CALLING?
- THE STATION.

07:14.902 --> 07:17.070
- I'M GOING TO TAKE YOU.
- CARL, PLEASE, NO.

07:17.104 --> 07:19.206
IT'LL JUST MAKE IT WORSE,
ALL RIGHT?

07:19.239 --> 07:21.208
THINKING THAT I'M KEEPING
YOU FROM WORK.

07:21.241 --> 07:23.143
- [sighs]

07:28.148 --> 07:31.218
- YOU GO SOLVE A MURDER OR TWO.

07:31.251 --> 07:32.620
- I WISH
I COULD SOLVE THIS.

07:32.653 --> 07:36.724
- GENTLY, GENTLY.

07:36.757 --> 07:38.959
- LOOK, PROMISE YOU'LL CALL ME

07:38.992 --> 07:40.861
AS SOON AS YOU HEAR
WHAT THE DOCTOR SAYS.

07:40.894 --> 07:42.930
- I PROMISE.

07:46.867 --> 07:47.968
OOH!

07:48.001 --> 07:49.903
[gasps]

07:49.937 --> 07:52.906
IT'S OKAY, HONEY.

07:57.177 --> 07:59.580
- I'LL BE AT HOFFMAN'S
DEPARTMENT STORE

07:59.613 --> 08:01.048
TODAY FROM 1:00 TO 3:00,

08:01.081 --> 08:02.516
SIGNING AUTOGRAPHS,

08:02.550 --> 08:05.986
GIVING TIPS ON HOW
TO BE FABULOUS.

08:06.019 --> 08:09.256
BE SURE TO STOP BY.

08:09.289 --> 08:10.658
OH, TEDDY, I FEEL AS IF

08:10.691 --> 08:12.860
I'VE FINALLY FOUND
MY CALLING,

08:12.893 --> 08:14.528
THAT GOD HAS APPOINTED ME
FROM ABOVE

08:14.562 --> 08:16.630
TO DO HIS WORK BELOW.

08:16.664 --> 08:20.868
- SAINT EMMETT, PATRON SAINT
OF THE FASHION IMPOVERISHED,

08:20.901 --> 08:23.036
THE STYLE DEPRIVED.
- YOU LAUGH,

08:23.070 --> 08:25.773
BUT THERE IS SOMETHING
ALMOST HOLY

08:25.806 --> 08:27.641
ABOUT SAVING THE THOUSANDS
OF WALKING DISASTERS

08:27.675 --> 08:29.910
IN THIS TOWN.

08:29.943 --> 08:32.913
OF WHICH HE IS
DEFINITELY NOT ONE.

08:38.218 --> 08:39.753
BELIEVE THAT GUY?

08:39.787 --> 08:42.623
WALKED RIGHT BY,
DIDN'T EVEN RECOGNIZE ME.

08:42.656 --> 08:44.625
- BUT I RECOGNIZE HIM.

08:44.658 --> 08:47.227
- IS HE SOMEONE?

08:47.260 --> 08:49.563
- OH, HE'S SOMEONE,
ALL RIGHT.

08:53.200 --> 08:54.968
PRIDE 2002.

08:55.002 --> 08:56.303
WE HAD AMAZING SEX.

08:56.336 --> 08:58.105
AT LEAST, I THOUGHT SO.

08:58.138 --> 09:01.642
THEN THE NEXT DAY,
MET HIM AT WOODY'S.

09:01.675 --> 09:04.645
HE TOLD ME ONCE A YEAR
HE FINDS SOME LOSER GUY.

09:04.678 --> 09:07.648
- LIKE YOU,
AND I GIVE HIM A BREAK.

09:07.681 --> 09:10.651
I GIVE HIM--
I GIVE HIM ME.

09:10.684 --> 09:12.786
THE FUCK OF HIS LIFE.

09:12.820 --> 09:14.955
YOU KNOW,
SOMETHING HE CAN REMEMBER.

09:14.988 --> 09:16.824
IT'S LIKE A SOUVENIR.

09:16.857 --> 09:20.227
IT'S MY WAY OF GIVING BACK
TO THE COMMUNITY.

09:20.260 --> 09:22.329
- TEDDY, THAT WAS EONS AGO.

09:22.362 --> 09:23.697
LOOK AT YOU NOW,
THIN, GORGEOUS,

09:23.731 --> 09:25.933
GUYS FALLING ALL OVER YOU.

09:25.966 --> 09:27.200
- IT WAS THE SINGLE MOST
HUMILIATING EXPERIENCE

09:27.234 --> 09:28.201
OF MY LIFE.

09:28.235 --> 09:31.204
EVERYBODY CALLED ME...

09:31.238 --> 09:34.074
"AUNT PITY FUCK."

09:34.107 --> 09:36.343
- WELL, AS PAINFUL AS
IT MAY HAVE BEEN,

09:36.376 --> 09:39.780
YOU JUST HAVE
TO LET IT GO.

09:47.254 --> 09:50.590
- OR GET EVEN.

09:52.760 --> 09:54.695
- I'M NOT GONNA
MAKE HIM NERVOUS.

09:54.728 --> 09:57.998
I'LL SIT IN THE BACK.
HE WON'T EVEN KNOW I'M THERE.

09:58.031 --> 09:59.967
WELL, I-I JUST WANT
TO SEE HIM IN ACTION.

10:00.000 --> 10:02.102
WE'LL STOP BY
THE STORE AFTERWARDS.

10:02.135 --> 10:07.407
I'LL TAKE YOU BOTH
TO DINNER.

10:07.440 --> 10:10.110
LOVE!

10:10.143 --> 10:12.713
OH, GOD.

10:12.746 --> 10:14.848
CALLIE?

10:14.882 --> 10:16.149
IT'S BEN.

10:16.183 --> 10:18.385
- MR. BRUCKNER. I KNOW.
HUNTER'S DAD.

10:18.418 --> 10:20.287
- HEY, I CAME TO WATCH HIM
DEBATE.

10:20.320 --> 10:22.890
WHICH WAY IS
THE AUDITORIUM?

10:22.923 --> 10:25.726
- AS YOU GO IN,
IT'S ON THE RIGHT.

10:25.759 --> 10:26.727
- AH.

10:26.760 --> 10:28.929
[both laugh]

10:28.962 --> 10:31.732
- BUT I DON'T THINK
THERE'S A DEBATE.

10:31.765 --> 10:35.135
THEY'RE--THEY'VE GOT
A CHORUS PRACTICE.

10:35.168 --> 10:37.037
- WELL, YOU SURE?

10:41.041 --> 10:43.677
- IS HUNTER OKAY?

10:43.711 --> 10:47.014
HE HASN'T BEEN IN SCHOOL
ALL WEEK.

10:47.047 --> 10:48.415
- OH, HE'S FINE.

10:48.448 --> 10:53.721
I-I GUESS I MUST'VE
MISUNDERSTOOD HIM.

10:58.926 --> 11:00.961
- THIS PINK STRIPED SHIRT

11:00.994 --> 11:03.230
WILL LOOK FAB
UNDER THIS JACKET.

11:03.263 --> 11:05.766
AND OH, OH, OH.

11:05.799 --> 11:09.169
AND SEE HOW THIS TIE
REALLY MAKES IT POP?

11:09.202 --> 11:11.438
- FRANKLY, I DON'T CARE
WHAT CLOTHES IRWIN WEARS.

11:11.471 --> 11:13.774
HE TOOK YOUR ADVICE FROM THE
OTHER NIGHT AND SHAVED HIS HEAD,

11:13.807 --> 11:16.176
YOU KNOW,
EMBRACED HIS BALDNESS?

11:16.209 --> 11:17.978
NOW I BARELY LET HIM
OUT OF THE BEDROOM.

11:18.011 --> 11:20.313
- I CAN'T TELL YOU

11:20.347 --> 11:21.915
HOW MUCH IT WARMS MY HEART
TO KNOW

11:21.949 --> 11:23.817
I'M KEEPING HETEROS HORNY.

11:28.088 --> 11:30.057
- YOU ARE A SUPERSTAR!

11:30.090 --> 11:32.459
- MWAH. LOOK AT THIS CROWD.

11:40.834 --> 11:42.102
I CAN'T TELL YOU
WHAT IT MEANS

11:42.135 --> 11:43.804
THAT YOU'D SHOW
UP TO SUPPORT ME.

11:43.837 --> 11:45.505
- WELL, I NEEDED SOCKS.

11:45.538 --> 11:47.274
- DON'T PAY ANY ATTENTION
TO HIM.

11:47.307 --> 11:48.876
- HE'S AS PROUD OF YOU
AS WE ARE. AREN'T YOU?

11:48.909 --> 11:50.744
- [scoffs]

11:50.778 --> 11:52.079
YEAH, IT'S AN HONOR
TO COUNT AMONG

11:52.112 --> 11:53.346
OUR CLOSE, PERSONAL FRIENDS

11:53.380 --> 11:56.149
TELEVISION'S LATEST
GAY EUNUCH.

11:56.183 --> 11:57.751
- EXCUSE ME?

11:57.785 --> 12:01.488
- YOU KNOW,
AS IN NON-SEXUAL,

12:01.521 --> 12:03.957
NON-THREATENING,

12:03.991 --> 12:06.159
BALL-LESS.

12:06.193 --> 12:09.229
YOU DO HOMAGE TO A LONG
AND ILLUSTRIOUS LINE

12:09.262 --> 12:10.964
OF LOVABLE,
LAUGHABLE CLOWNS

12:10.998 --> 12:12.866
WHO'VE COME
BEFORE YOU.

12:12.900 --> 12:17.170
WHY, JUST LOOK AT
ALL THESE PEOPLE!

12:17.204 --> 12:18.839
- THEY'RE MY FANS.

12:18.872 --> 12:19.973
THEY ADORE ME.

12:20.007 --> 12:23.376
- BECAUSE YOU'RE SO CUTE.

12:23.410 --> 12:25.779
BUT DO YOU THINK
THEY'D STILL ADORE YOU

12:25.813 --> 12:29.917
IF THEY KNEW YOU TOOK IT
UP THE ASS AND LIKED IT?

12:29.950 --> 12:31.919
- LIKE I SAID, BRIAN,

12:31.952 --> 12:33.253
I CAN'T TELL YOU
WHAT IT MEANS

12:33.286 --> 12:36.857

12:41.361 --> 12:43.130
YOU'RE SO CUTE!

12:43.163 --> 12:44.464

12:44.497 --> 12:47.901
- MA'AM. MA'AM,
STEP BACK, PLEASE.

12:50.603 --> 12:52.472
- HE'S BEEN LYING TO US?

12:52.505 --> 12:55.075
- I'M SURE THERE'S A REASON.

12:55.108 --> 12:56.543
I DIDN'T SAY
A GOOD REASON.

12:56.576 --> 12:58.278
- BUT I THOUGHT
HE TRUSTED US,

12:58.311 --> 13:00.280
THAT, YOU KNOW,
HE TOLD US EVERYTHING.

13:00.313 --> 13:02.349
- DID YOU TELL YOUR MOTHER
EVERYTHING WHEN YOU WERE 17?

13:02.382 --> 13:03.884
- I DIDN'T HAVE TO.

13:03.917 --> 13:05.819
THERE WERE HIDDEN MONITORS
IN EVERY ROOM.

13:05.853 --> 13:07.220
SHE HAD A HOMING DEVICE
IMPLANTED

13:07.254 --> 13:09.089
IN MY BRAIN SOON
AFTER BIRTH.

13:09.122 --> 13:11.291
IT'S THE ONLY EXPLANATION
HOW SHE AUTOMATICALLY KNEW.

13:11.324 --> 13:13.026
- HERE HE--
HERE HE COMES.

13:13.060 --> 13:15.428
NOW, LET'S TRY NOT TO LET
OUR EMOTIONS RUN AMOK.

13:15.462 --> 13:17.064
- WELL, THAT'S EASY
FOR YOU TO SAY.

13:17.097 --> 13:20.067
YOU COME FROM A LONG LINE
OF REPRESSED ALCOHOLICS.

13:20.100 --> 13:21.334
- SORRY I'M LATE.

13:21.368 --> 13:22.903
I WAS IN DEBATE CLUB.

13:22.936 --> 13:24.437
THIS WEEK'S TOPIC IS...

13:24.471 --> 13:28.341
- SECRETS AND LIES?

13:28.375 --> 13:31.511
WE KNOW YOU HAVEN'T BEEN
IN SCHOOL ALL WEEK.

13:35.382 --> 13:37.184
[door closes]

13:37.217 --> 13:38.485
- BETTER.

13:41.254 --> 13:42.856
- WOULD YOU JUST LEAVE ME
THE FUCK ALONE?

13:42.890 --> 13:43.991
I TOLD YOU I DON'T WANT TO
TALK ABOUT IT.

13:44.024 --> 13:46.526
- WE HAVE TO TALK ABOUT IT.

13:46.559 --> 13:48.128
- WE WANT TO HELP YOU.

13:48.161 --> 13:49.863
- YOU CAN'T HELP ME.
NOBODY CAN HELP ME.

13:49.897 --> 13:50.964
IT'S TOO LATE.

13:50.998 --> 13:52.332
- IT'S NEVER TOO LATE.

13:52.365 --> 13:54.234
- LOOK, I KNOW IT'S BEEN
A TOUGH FEW WEEKS.

13:54.267 --> 13:56.369
- TRY YEARS.

13:56.403 --> 13:59.106
- OKAY. OKAY, BUT THERE'S
GOT TO BE A SOLUTION.

13:59.139 --> 14:01.041
- I CAN'T GO BACK
TO THAT SCHOOL.

14:01.074 --> 14:02.075
EVERYBODY JUST STARES AT ME

14:02.109 --> 14:03.410
LIKE
I'M A PIECE OF SHIT,

14:03.443 --> 14:04.511
AND WHEN THEY DO,
THAT'S HOW I FEEL.

14:04.544 --> 14:07.080
- YOU'RE NOT A PIECE OF SHIT.

14:07.114 --> 14:09.249
YOU'RE A BRAVE, SMART,
FUNNY, WONDERFUL PERSON.

14:09.282 --> 14:11.618
- AND YOU'RE OUR SON.
- AND WE LOVE YOU.

14:11.651 --> 14:13.086
- AND YOU DON'T
HAVE TO LIE TO US.

14:13.120 --> 14:15.488
WE KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE GOING THROUGH.

14:15.522 --> 14:18.258
- YOU HAVE NO IDEA.

14:21.028 --> 14:22.029
[door closes]

14:22.062 --> 14:27.667
- HOW ABOUT A BARBECUE GRILL?

14:27.700 --> 14:29.369
OR MAYBE FIREPLACE TOOLS.

14:29.402 --> 14:30.637
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

14:30.670 --> 14:32.239
- I THINK IF YOU
DON'T STOP TALKING

14:32.272 --> 14:33.974
ABOUT THEIR
GODDAMN HOUSEWARMING GIFT,

14:34.007 --> 14:38.278
I'M GOING TO BURN THEIR
FUCKING PLACE DOWN.

14:38.311 --> 14:41.114
ANOTHER ROUND.
- WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM?

14:41.148 --> 14:42.249
- I HAVE NO PROBLEM.

14:42.282 --> 14:44.684
I AM PROBLEM-LESS.

14:44.717 --> 14:46.586
A PROBLEM-FREE ZONE.

14:46.619 --> 14:49.189
- THEN HELP ME PICK
SOMETHING OUT.

14:49.222 --> 14:51.324
- [sighs]

14:55.695 --> 14:57.998
- A HANDS-FREE TOILET.

14:58.031 --> 15:00.267
"SENSES YOU ARE THERE
AND AUTOMATICALLY FLUSHES."

15:00.300 --> 15:02.269
- YEAH.

15:02.302 --> 15:04.671
300 BUCKS DOWN THE CRAPPER.

15:04.704 --> 15:07.140
- ARE YOU GOING TO TELL ME
WHAT'S WRONG?

15:07.174 --> 15:08.341
- NO.

15:08.375 --> 15:10.377
- FINE.

15:20.320 --> 15:21.354
- [clicks tongue]

15:21.388 --> 15:23.690
ANYWAY...

15:23.723 --> 15:26.293
YOU WOULDN'T UNDERSTAND.

15:26.326 --> 15:30.163
- I'LL SHOW YOU
MY S.A.T. SCORES.

15:30.197 --> 15:31.464
- YOU'RE TOO YOUNG.

15:31.498 --> 15:33.300
- COMPARED TO WHO?

15:33.333 --> 15:38.705
- WHOM.
- YOU?

15:38.738 --> 15:41.108
- THAT HOT GUY, I FOLLOWED
INTO THE BACK ROOM

15:41.141 --> 15:42.342
THE OTHER NIGHT?

15:42.375 --> 15:44.711
- WHAT ABOUT HIM?

15:44.744 --> 15:50.183
- WHEN I WENT
FOR HIS COCK...

15:50.217 --> 15:52.185
NEVER MIND.

15:52.219 --> 15:56.223
- WOULD YOU JUST SAY IT?

15:56.256 --> 15:58.058
- MY HAND.

15:58.091 --> 16:01.228
- "YOUR HAND"?

16:01.261 --> 16:06.399
WHAT?

16:06.433 --> 16:09.469
[scoffs]

16:09.502 --> 16:10.770
IF IT'S ANY COMFORT,
YOU'RE STILL

16:10.803 --> 16:14.341
THE HOTTEST GUY
IN PITTSBURGH.

16:14.374 --> 16:15.608

NOW HELP ME OUT HERE.

16:15.642 --> 16:17.244
WE CAN'T SHOW UP
WITHOUT A GIFT.

16:17.277 --> 16:19.246
- I'M NOT GOING TO
THEIR FUCKING PARTY.

16:19.279 --> 16:20.747
- WHY NOT?

16:20.780 --> 16:25.485
- BECAUSE I'M GOING
TO A FUCKING PARTY.

WAXING HIS BACK

16:43.270 --> 16:44.371
FOR AN UPCOMING SEGMENT.

16:44.404 --> 16:46.406
- CHRIST.

16:46.439 --> 16:48.308
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
PRACTICING SOMETHING ELSE.

16:48.341 --> 16:49.542
- OKAY, THAT'S IT.

16:49.576 --> 16:51.144
I-I-I'VE HAD IT.

16:51.178 --> 16:53.046
- YOU'RE ONLY HALF-WAXED.
- YEAH.

16:53.080 --> 16:57.584
AND IF YOU GO DOWN ANY FURTHER,
I'LL BE HALF-ASSED.

16:57.617 --> 16:58.785
- HOW ABOUT YOU, DEB?

16:58.818 --> 17:01.488
WANT ME TO GIVE YOU
A LANDING STRIP?

17:01.521 --> 17:05.125
- THANKS, BUT I PREFER TO
KEEP THE ENTIRE AIRPORT.

17:05.158 --> 17:06.526

17:06.559 --> 17:07.694
- NO.

17:07.727 --> 17:11.664
DAMN IT.

17:11.698 --> 17:13.166
- WHAT'D
THE NEW DOCTOR SAY?

17:13.200 --> 17:14.601

17:16.103 --> 17:18.671
WISE ASS.

17:18.705 --> 17:20.407
MAYBE THIS'LL BRING DOWN
MY FEVER.

17:20.440 --> 17:23.176
- YOU JUST SAID YOU DON'T
HAVE A FEVER.

17:23.210 --> 17:25.078
- THAT'S WHAT
THE THERMOMETER SAID.

17:25.112 --> 17:28.047
I KNOW I'M BURNING UP.

17:36.189 --> 17:37.724

THINK I'M PHYSICALLY
ATTRACTIVE?

17:39.659 --> 17:42.362
YOU KNOW, SEXY?

17:42.395 --> 17:44.564
- WELL, KEEPING IN MIND

17:44.597 --> 17:47.500
THAT I'M A HETEROSEXUAL
WOMAN OF A CERTAIN AGE,

17:47.534 --> 17:50.170

18:15.395 --> 18:18.131
MOST VIEWERS DON'T WANT TO
THINK ABOUT GAYS HAVING SEX.

OF TWO GUYS KISSING,

IT JUST MAKES THEM
UNCOMFORTABLE.

THAT ONCE A WOMAN REACHES
THE AGE OF 35,

SHE'S ALL BUT INVISIBLE
TO MOST MEN.

20:02.535 --> 20:06.373

VISIBLE AGAIN.

THINK THAT THEY CAN BE.

22:35.488 --> 22:36.989
- OY, THINGS AREN'T
QUITE THE SAME

22:37.023 --> 22:38.591
AROUND HERE SINCE YOU LEFT.

22:38.625 --> 22:40.593
- OY, SO I NOTICE.

22:40.627 --> 22:42.629
- EXCUSE ME, MISS?

22:42.662 --> 22:44.030
- KIKI, THIS IS COLD.

22:44.063 --> 22:45.498
- OH, I DON'T KNOW.
- CAN I GET THAT COFFEE?

22:45.532 --> 22:46.733
- THE WAY I'VE BEEN
FEELING LATELY,

22:46.766 --> 22:49.469
I BARELY HAD THE ENERGY
TO CRAWL HERE.

22:49.502 --> 22:51.471
- HAVE YOU BEEN TO SEE A--
- FIVE OF 'EM.

22:51.504 --> 22:53.039
ALL CLAIM TO HAVE DEGREES.

22:53.072 --> 22:55.007
NOT ONE OF THEM SAYS
THEY CAN TELL ME WHAT'S WRONG.

22:55.041 --> 22:56.609
- HEY! CAN WE GET A MENU?

22:56.643 --> 22:58.010
- I-I ASKED FOR CREAM.

22:58.044 --> 22:59.946
- WHERE'S MY FUCKING LUNCH?

22:59.979 --> 23:01.648
- [rings bell]
YOUR FOOD IS UP.

23:01.681 --> 23:03.483
- [groans]

23:03.516 --> 23:05.752
I'M A TRANNY ON THE VERGE
OF A NERVOUS BREAKDOWN.

23:05.785 --> 23:07.019
[hyperventilating]

23:07.053 --> 23:08.955
SIT DOWN,
CALM YOUR NERVES.

23:08.988 --> 23:11.491
- I--

23:11.524 --> 23:13.793
*

23:13.826 --> 23:15.495
THAT'S THE FISH AND CHIPS
WITH SLAW

23:15.528 --> 23:16.796
AND THE TURKEY BURGER
WITH THE FRIES.

23:16.829 --> 23:17.897
HERE ARE YOUR MENUS.

23:17.930 --> 23:20.500
SPECIALS ARE ON THE BOARD.

23:20.533 --> 23:22.835
2%. IT'S BETTER FOR YOU
THAN CREAM.

23:22.869 --> 23:26.939
*

23:30.877 --> 23:33.045
- DEB, I THINK I KNOW
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU.

23:33.079 --> 23:34.781
- YEAH?

23:34.814 --> 23:37.850
- B.F.M.

23:37.884 --> 23:42.121
- "B.F.M"?

23:42.154 --> 23:44.991
SOUNDS SERIOUS.

23:45.024 --> 23:46.593
WHAT IS IT?

23:46.626 --> 23:51.864
- "BORED OUT OF
YOUR FUCKING MIND".

23:51.898 --> 23:53.132
[baby fusses]

23:53.165 --> 23:54.834
- HMM.

23:56.035 --> 23:57.937
- LISTEN UP, STRAIGHT BOYS.

23:57.970 --> 23:59.806
TAKE A TIP FROM
THE QUEER GUY.

23:59.839 --> 24:03.075
WEARING THESE WILL NOT GET
YOU WHERE YOU WANT TO GO,

24:03.109 --> 24:05.011
COMPRENEZ-VOUS?

24:05.044 --> 24:06.813
THESE, HOWEVER,

24:06.846 --> 24:09.215
WILL DEFINITELY GENERATE
A LITTLE FRICTION.

24:09.248 --> 24:12.685
I KNOW BECAUSE THEY HAPPEN
TO BE MY VERY OWN PAIR.

24:12.719 --> 24:16.088
THEY SET OFF
YOUR NICE, TIGHT...

24:16.122 --> 24:17.624
"ASS-SETS,"

24:17.657 --> 24:21.894
AND, UH, NOTICE
THE POUCH IN THE CROTCH.

24:21.928 --> 24:24.497
IF YOU NEED A LITTLE HELP,
YOU CAN STUFF A SOCK

24:24.531 --> 24:26.833
OR HAMSTER IN THERE.
[chuckles]

24:26.866 --> 24:28.234
I CERTAINLY DON'T NEED
THE CAVALRY

24:28.267 --> 24:29.602
TO COME TO MY RESCUE.

24:29.636 --> 24:31.838
MY CUP IS FILLED
TO THE RIM,

24:31.871 --> 24:34.741
WHICH LEADS US
TO ANOTHER TOPIC,

24:34.774 --> 24:36.175
BUT NOT TONIGHT.

24:36.208 --> 24:37.910
I'M THE QUEER GUY.

24:37.944 --> 24:41.047
BE FABULOUS!

24:41.080 --> 24:43.983
[upbeat music]

24:44.016 --> 24:47.987
- THANK YOU, QUEER GUY,
FOR THAT "BRIEF" REPORT.

24:48.020 --> 24:50.022
THAT'S THE NEWS.
WE'LL BE BACK AT 11:00.

24:50.056 --> 24:51.758
- WE'RE OUT.

24:54.026 --> 24:55.728
- I THOUGHT YOU TOLD ME

24:55.762 --> 24:57.864
YOU WERE GOING TO TALK
ABOUT HAIR-WAXING.

24:57.897 --> 24:59.165
- WELL, WAXING IS VITAL,

24:59.198 --> 25:00.767
BUT IT'S NOT SEXY.

25:00.800 --> 25:03.302
- SEXY?
WHO WANTS SEXY?

25:03.335 --> 25:05.271
- DON, YOU'VE ONLY BEEN
MARRIED A FEW WEEKS

25:05.304 --> 25:07.006
AND ALREADY YOU CAN
MAKE A STATEMENT LIKE THAT?

25:07.039 --> 25:08.541
YOU MAY NEED COUNSELING.

25:08.575 --> 25:12.679
- AND YOU MAY NEED
UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE.

25:12.712 --> 25:13.746
- WHAT?

25:13.780 --> 25:14.914
- DON'T EVER

25:14.947 --> 25:19.151
SHOW US YOUR...SHORTS AGAIN.

25:19.185 --> 25:20.820
- IT'S JUST UNDERWEAR.

25:20.853 --> 25:22.188
- WELL, YOU DON'T HAVE
TO AIR THEM IN PUBLIC.

25:22.221 --> 25:25.992
AND NO ONE WANTS TO KNOW
THAT YOU HAVE A TIGHT...

25:27.927 --> 25:29.161
- ASS?

25:29.195 --> 25:31.297
- OR A BIG...
- DICK?

25:31.330 --> 25:33.232
- AND THAT YOU...
- FUCK?

25:33.265 --> 25:35.768
WELL, HERE'S A PIECE
OF NEWS FOR YOU.

25:35.802 --> 25:37.236
I DO!
- WELL, FROM NOW ON,

25:37.269 --> 25:38.838
STICK TO COOKING AND FLOWERS

25:38.871 --> 25:40.773
AND TURNING STRAIGHT GUYS
INTO METROSEXUALS,

25:40.807 --> 25:45.344
AND LEAVE YOUR SEX LIFE
OFF-SCREEN!

25:45.377 --> 25:47.146
GET MCGREGOR
ON THE PHONE, NOW.

25:50.282 --> 25:51.651
- JUST TURN OFF
THE BACK LIGHTS.

25:51.684 --> 25:53.252
YEAH. DO THAT.

25:55.387 --> 25:57.189
- YOU CAN STAY FOR
AT LEAST AN HOUR.

25:57.223 --> 25:59.358
- I TOLD YOU I'M MAKING
A SPECIAL GUEST APPEARANCE,

25:59.391 --> 26:01.628
THEN I'M OUT OF HERE.
- IT'S FOR MICHAEL.

26:01.661 --> 26:03.930
- HE SHOULD UNDERSTAND BETTER
THAN ANYONE,

26:03.963 --> 26:05.131
THE FIRST RULE OF GOING
TO A SEX PARTY

26:05.164 --> 26:06.332
IS DON'T COME LATE.

26:06.365 --> 26:07.834
OTHERWISE,
YOU MAY NOT COME AT ALL.

26:07.867 --> 26:09.201
- WELL, THAT CERTAINLY
GIVES NEW MEANING

26:09.235 --> 26:11.838
TO THE EARLY BIRD
CATCHES THE WORM.

26:11.871 --> 26:13.606
- HI!

26:13.640 --> 26:16.142
I'M GLAD YOU COULD COME.

26:16.175 --> 26:18.077
- IT'S ALL I'VE
BEEN LIVING FOR.

26:18.110 --> 26:22.281
- HAPPY HOUSEWARMING.

26:22.314 --> 26:24.350
- IS IT A HARNESS AND PADDLE
TO GO WITH THE SLING?

26:24.383 --> 26:26.185
- NO. I PICKED
THIS ONE OUT.

26:29.121 --> 26:30.823
- YOU GUYS HAVE DONE
A GREAT JOB.

26:30.857 --> 26:32.091
- OH, WE'RE NOT THROUGH.

26:32.124 --> 26:33.292
TRUST ME,
YOU'RE NEVER THROUGH.

26:33.325 --> 26:35.762
[laughing]
- ALL IT TAKES IS TIME.

26:35.795 --> 26:36.763
- AND MONEY.

26:36.796 --> 26:38.364
- YEAH, TELL ME ABOUT IT.

26:38.397 --> 26:41.300
OKAY, UH, SAY
SOMETHING FOR POSTERITY.

26:41.333 --> 26:42.969
- I'M FUCKING STARVING.

26:43.002 --> 26:45.972
- [laughs]
- OH. SHIT.

26:46.005 --> 26:47.173
- IT'S OKAY, DEB.

26:47.206 --> 26:48.975
I WANTED SOMETHING
FOR POSTERITY.

26:49.008 --> 26:51.110
- UM...
[clears throat]

26:51.143 --> 26:52.244
POSTERITY.

26:52.278 --> 26:55.381
UH, LET'S SEE.

26:55.414 --> 26:57.850
I'M VERY PROUD
OF YOU BOTH,

26:57.884 --> 27:01.688
AND I WISH YOU ALL THE HEALTH
AND HAPPINESS IN THE WORLD

27:01.721 --> 27:04.323
IN YOUR BEAUTIFUL
NEW HOME.

27:04.356 --> 27:05.892
HOW'S THAT?

27:05.925 --> 27:09.328
- PERFECT.

27:09.361 --> 27:10.897
IT'S AMAZING WHAT
THE GAYS HAVE DONE

27:10.930 --> 27:12.398
WITH THIS NEIGHBORHOOD.

27:12.431 --> 27:14.433
IT USED TO BE ALL WHOREHOUSES
AND BOOKIE JOINTS.

27:14.466 --> 27:17.003
- I KNOW. I USED TO HANG
OUT HERE ALL THE TIME.

27:17.036 --> 27:18.204
- REALLY?
[doorbell rings]

27:18.237 --> 27:20.406
- WHEN I WAS A BEAT COP.

27:20.439 --> 27:23.309
- I'LL GET IT.

27:25.211 --> 27:26.178
- HI.

27:26.212 --> 27:27.179
- COME ON IN.

27:27.213 --> 27:29.749
HEY, HONEYBUN.

27:29.782 --> 27:31.417

27:31.450 --> 27:34.020
EVEN THOUGH--
I MEAN...

27:34.053 --> 27:38.324
- WELL, WE'RE STILL FAMILY,
AREN'T WE?

27:38.357 --> 27:39.826
- HAPPY NEW HOUSE.
[chuckles]

27:39.859 --> 27:40.927
- THANKS.

27:40.960 --> 27:41.928
YOU MIND
IF I SHOW HER OFF?

27:41.961 --> 27:45.898
- BE MY GUEST.

27:45.932 --> 27:48.801
HEY, EVERYONE, MEET
MY BEAUTIFUL DAUGHTER.

27:48.835 --> 27:51.203
[all exclaiming]

27:51.237 --> 27:53.239
- HEY.
- HI, BABE.

27:53.272 --> 27:55.374
- HEY, LOOK WHO IT IS.
- SHE'S CUTE.

27:55.407 --> 27:57.209
- I KNOW!

27:57.243 --> 27:59.712
- FIRST I'M GOING TO GIVE HIM
THE FUCKING OF HIS LIFE,

27:59.746 --> 28:01.247
THEN I'M GOING TO GIVE HIM
THE MIND-FUCKING OF HIS LIFE.

28:01.280 --> 28:03.315
I'M GOING TO SAY, "ONCE
I WAS YOUR PITY-FUCK,

28:03.349 --> 28:07.053
BUT TONIGHT YOU'RE MINE,
YOU ARROGANT ASSHOLE."

28:07.086 --> 28:08.721
- SPEAKING OF WHICH...

28:08.755 --> 28:10.322
- AREN'T YOU TWO AUNTIES
GOING TO GO

28:10.356 --> 28:14.827
"OOH" AND "AHH"
OVER THE BABY?

28:14.861 --> 28:18.197
I CAUGHT YOUR UNDERPANTS
ON THE NEWS THE OTHER NIGHT.

28:18.230 --> 28:20.199
YOU SAVING YOUR DICK
FOR SWEEPS?

28:20.232 --> 28:23.369
- MY PRODUCER HAPPENED TO THINK
IT WAS A TERRIFIC SEGMENT.

28:23.402 --> 28:25.104
YEAH, HE SAID
IT WAS ABOUT TIME

28:25.137 --> 28:28.074
WE SAW GAY PEOPLE AS FULL,
SEXUALISED HUMAN BEINGS,

28:28.107 --> 28:32.979
NOT JUST STEREOTYPIC
EUNUCHS AND CLOWNS.

28:33.012 --> 28:36.048
NOW IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME.

28:43.122 --> 28:45.157
- OUR DAUGHTER'S A HIT.
- HMM.

28:45.191 --> 28:48.360
I'D SAY SO.

28:48.394 --> 28:49.962
- GLAD YOU CAME.

28:49.996 --> 28:51.831
- MM.

28:51.864 --> 28:55.835
IF FOR NO OTHER REASON,
I'M STARVING.

28:55.868 --> 28:59.972
- IT MAKES ME THINK
OF OUR HOUSEWARMING.

29:00.006 --> 29:02.374
- IF ANYONE NEEDS PROOF
THAT TOILETS

29:02.408 --> 29:04.143
ARE CONTROLLED
BY COSMIC FORCES...

29:04.176 --> 29:05.544
- WHY ELSE WOULD
THEY BREAK DOWN

29:05.577 --> 29:07.313
TEN MINUTES BEFORE
THE GUESTS SHOWED UP?

29:07.346 --> 29:09.315
- A HUNDRED DYKES PEEING
IN THE BACKYARD.

29:09.348 --> 29:12.985
- THE BUSHES IN THE BUSHES.

29:13.019 --> 29:18.324
[both giggling]

29:18.357 --> 29:19.859
[clinking]

29:19.892 --> 29:21.027
- EVERYBODY.

29:21.060 --> 29:23.262
- CAN WE HAVE
YOUR ATTENTION?

29:23.295 --> 29:26.999
WE'D JUST LIKE TO
WELCOME ALL OF YOU

29:27.033 --> 29:28.400
TO OUR NEW HOME.

29:28.434 --> 29:30.469
- BEAUTIFUL NEW HOME.

29:30.502 --> 29:32.071
- AND WE LOOK FORWARD
TO SHARING

29:32.104 --> 29:35.074
MANY HAPPY FAMILY OCCASIONS
HERE TOGETHER.

29:35.107 --> 29:37.276
[cheers and applause]

29:37.309 --> 29:39.879
- HAPPY FAMILY OCCASIONS.

29:39.912 --> 29:44.016
- WE ALSO HAVE ANOTHER REASON
TO CELEBRATE TONIGHT.

29:44.050 --> 29:47.887
RAGE AND J.T.
ARE GETTING MARRIED.

29:47.920 --> 29:50.356
- IT'S ABOUT TIME THOSE
TWO SUPERHEROES SETTLED DOWN!

29:50.389 --> 29:53.025
- WHEN DO THEY START RAISING
A SUPER FAMILY?

29:53.059 --> 29:54.093
- THAT'S NEXT.

29:54.126 --> 29:55.427
- GOT A COPY FOR EVERYONE.

29:55.461 --> 29:58.965
OUR LITTLE HOUSEWARMING
GIFT TO YOU.

29:58.998 --> 30:01.100
HERE YOU GO, BRIAN.

30:01.133 --> 30:04.070
[overlapping chatter]

30:06.138 --> 30:07.806
HERE YOU ARE.
- YOU LIKE IT?

30:10.276 --> 30:12.044
- REMINDS ME OF
THIS NORMAN ROCKWELL

30:12.078 --> 30:14.313
I SAW IN THE DOCTOR'S OFFICE
WHEN I WAS A KID.

30:14.346 --> 30:18.050
A LITTLE GIRL AND BOY DRESSED
AS A BRIDE AND GROOM

30:18.084 --> 30:21.854
AND THEIR ADORABLE PUPPY
TUGGING ON THE BRIDAL GOWN.

30:21.888 --> 30:23.355
JUST THEN THE NURSE
CAME IN AND STABBED ME

30:23.389 --> 30:25.124
IN THE FINGER FOR BLOOD.

30:25.157 --> 30:27.927
- AND YOU'VE HAD AN AVERSION
TO MARRIAGE EVER SINCE?

30:27.960 --> 30:31.197
WELL, I HAPPEN TO THINK
IT'S A DAMN GOOD STORY.

30:31.230 --> 30:33.365
JUST BECAUSE IT DOESN'T AGREE
WITH YOUR ANTI-FAMILY VALUES

30:33.399 --> 30:37.069
IS NO REASON TO DUMP ON IT.

30:37.103 --> 30:39.038
- OKAY.

30:47.279 --> 30:49.148
- LET'S GET
THE WHOLE FAMILY.

30:49.181 --> 30:50.516
HOW DO YOU WORK
THIS THING?

30:50.549 --> 30:52.351
- GOOD IDEA.
I'LL--I'LL GET J.R.

30:52.384 --> 30:54.853
YOU GET HUNTER.
- OKAY.

30:57.656 --> 30:59.091
HEY, PAL,
WE'RE TAKING A VIDEO

30:59.125 --> 31:00.159

31:00.192 --> 31:02.094

31:02.128 --> 31:04.163

31:08.200 --> 31:09.168
[door closes]

31:09.201 --> 31:13.639

31:13.672 --> 31:18.044

32:03.990 --> 32:07.960
[men moaning, chuckling]

32:07.994 --> 32:10.262
- OH, YEAH.

32:12.731 --> 32:15.434
- THAT'LL BE $5.25.

32:15.467 --> 32:17.603
THANKS.

32:17.636 --> 32:20.439
ANOTHER SATISFIED
CUSTOMER.

32:20.472 --> 32:22.441
- YOU KNOW, YOU SAY THAT
EVERY TIME YOU SELL ONE.

32:22.474 --> 32:24.510
- I DO?
WELL, IT MUST BE TRUE.

32:24.543 --> 32:27.113
WE'VE SOLD 536 COPIES
ON THE WEBSITE

32:27.146 --> 32:28.580
AND ALMOST 200 HERE
IN THE STORE.

32:28.614 --> 32:30.316
- THOSE ARE ALL
WE HAVE LEFT.

32:30.349 --> 32:33.452
- EVERYBODY LOVES THAT
J.T. FINALLY GOT HIS MAN.

32:33.485 --> 32:35.654
- YEAH, EVERYONE
BUT YOU-KNOW-WHO.

32:35.687 --> 32:39.325
- YEAH, I DO KNOW WHO.

32:39.358 --> 32:41.760
WELL, WHAT DID YOU EXPECT?

32:41.793 --> 32:44.230
- WHAT DID I EXPECT?

32:44.263 --> 32:48.234
THAT LIFE MIGHT IMITATE ART?

32:48.267 --> 32:51.203
I'VE HEARD IT'S BEEN KNOWN
TO HAPPEN.

32:51.237 --> 32:53.072
AW, HOW COULD
I HAVE BEEN SUCKERED

32:53.105 --> 32:54.106
INTO MY OWN FANTASY?

32:54.140 --> 32:56.742
TALK ABOUT PATHETIC.

32:56.775 --> 32:58.610
NOBODY ON EARTH KNOWS
BETTER THAN I DO

32:58.644 --> 33:00.146
THAT UNLESS HE WERE
GENETICALLY ALTERED

33:00.179 --> 33:01.513
BY SOME NUCLEAR MISHAP,

33:01.547 --> 33:03.749
THAT COULD NEVER HAPPEN.

33:03.782 --> 33:05.617
- NOT A BAD STORY.

33:05.651 --> 33:08.154
- MM.
BUT THAT'S ALL IT IS.

33:08.187 --> 33:09.488
IT'S A STORY.

33:09.521 --> 33:11.223
[door bells jangle]

33:11.257 --> 33:16.362
- DO YOU HAVE
THE NEW ISSUE OF RAGE?

33:16.395 --> 33:18.397
THIS IS TOTALLY AWESOME.

33:21.400 --> 33:23.602
- ANOTHER SATISFIED CUSTOMER.

33:25.271 --> 33:27.273
- [groans]

33:29.275 --> 33:33.145
WELL, I THINK THE HOUSE
HAS BEEN OFFICIALLY WARMED,

33:33.179 --> 33:36.348
WOULDN'T YOU SAY?

33:37.716 --> 33:39.251
GREAT PARTY, HUH?

33:39.285 --> 33:41.420
EVERYBODY SEEMED
TO HAVE A GOOD TIME.

33:43.689 --> 33:46.125
- YEAH.

33:46.158 --> 33:48.827
IF YOU CALL MELANIE AND LINDSAY
DECLARING A CEASE-FIRE,

33:48.860 --> 33:52.064
BRIAN LEAVING TO GO
TO A SEX PARTY,

33:52.098 --> 33:54.166
AND YOU AND MICHAEL STICKING
THAT FUCKING CAMERA

33:54.200 --> 33:56.268
IN MY FACE PRETENDING
WE'RE THIS HAPPY FAMILY

33:56.302 --> 33:57.403
HAVING A "GOOD TIME."

33:57.436 --> 34:01.173
- WE'RE NOT PRETENDING.
WE ARE.

34:05.511 --> 34:08.414
YOU'RE GOING TO GET
THROUGH THIS.

34:08.447 --> 34:11.217
I PROMISE.

34:11.250 --> 34:14.720
- FUCK YOUR FALSE HOPE.

34:14.753 --> 34:18.190
THE WORLD'S
A STINKING SHITHOLE.

34:20.459 --> 34:23.329
- [sighs]

34:23.362 --> 34:25.597
I DON'T THINK SARTRE
COULD HAVE SAID IT ANY BETTER.

34:25.631 --> 34:28.200
- WHO?

34:29.868 --> 34:33.839
- LISTEN, I-I FOUND
A GREAT CHARTER SCHOOL.

34:33.872 --> 34:35.607
THEY HAVE
A WAITING LIST A MILE LONG,

34:35.641 --> 34:37.376
BUT ONE OF THE PROFESSORS
IN MY DEPARTMENT

34:37.409 --> 34:38.844
IS ON THE BOARD, SO I WAS
ABLE TO PULL A FEW STRINGS--

34:38.877 --> 34:41.580
- WHY EVEN BOTHER, HUH?

34:41.613 --> 34:42.781
THEY'LL JUST FIND
OUT THERE TOO,

34:42.814 --> 34:47.186
AND THEN IT WILL
START ALL OVER AGAIN.

34:47.219 --> 34:51.390
SO WHAT'S THE POINT OF MY GOING
TO ANOTHER FUCKING SCHOOL?

34:59.431 --> 35:01.099
- [sighs]

35:03.769 --> 35:06.738
- I HAVEN'T BEEN HERE
SINCE YOU LEFT.

35:06.772 --> 35:08.874
SOMEHOW IT'S NOT THE SAME.

35:08.907 --> 35:10.476
- YEAH.

35:10.509 --> 35:14.213
NEITHER AM I.

35:14.246 --> 35:16.348
CARL...

35:16.382 --> 35:21.820
HONEY, I FOUND OUT
WHAT'S WRONG WITH ME.

35:21.853 --> 35:24.623
- I JUST WANT YOU
TO KNOW...

35:24.656 --> 35:29.161
THAT WHATEVER IT IS...

35:29.195 --> 35:30.762
I'M IN THIS
FOR THE LONG HAUL.

35:30.796 --> 35:34.666
I'LL STAND BY YOU.
I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

35:34.700 --> 35:36.402
- I KNOW THAT,
SWEETHEART.

35:36.435 --> 35:37.669
THAT'S WHY
I LOVE YOU.

35:37.703 --> 35:40.172
- OKAY. TELL ME.

35:40.206 --> 35:44.510
NO, WAIT. WAIT.

35:44.543 --> 35:46.312
OKAY. TELL ME.

35:46.345 --> 35:48.514
- FIRST OF ALL,

35:48.547 --> 35:49.781
IT'S NOT A PHYSICAL THING.

35:49.815 --> 35:51.917
- OH!

35:51.950 --> 35:54.386
OOH.

35:54.420 --> 35:56.522
THAT'S A RELIEF.
- YEAH.

35:56.555 --> 36:00.259
- THEN WHAT?

36:00.292 --> 36:04.530
- IT'S HARD TO EXPLAIN.

36:04.563 --> 36:08.267
EVER SINCE I LEFT HERE,
I'VE FELT LOST.

36:08.300 --> 36:09.668
I HAVE NO PLACE TO GO,

36:09.701 --> 36:11.537
I GOT NOTHING TO DO
BUT SIT AT HOME

36:11.570 --> 36:14.440
AND BUY A LOT OF SHIT
THAT I DON'T WANT OFF THE TV.

36:14.473 --> 36:16.808
- THAT'S WHAT A LADY
OF LEISURE'S SUPPOSED TO DO.

36:16.842 --> 36:19.711
I MEAN, YOU KNOW, RELAX.
ENJOY YOURSELF.

36:19.745 --> 36:22.981
BE GLAD YOU
DON'T HAVE TO WORK.

36:23.014 --> 36:25.417
- IT'S FUNNY, I NEVER THOUGHT
OF IT AS WORK.

36:25.451 --> 36:29.755
- ALL THOSE LONG, HARD HOURS
ON YOUR FEET?

36:29.788 --> 36:30.989
JUGGLING PLATES?

36:31.022 --> 36:34.593
- TO ME, IT WAS MORE
LIKE A DANCE.

36:34.626 --> 36:37.429
AND I WAS
THE PRIMA BALLERINA.

36:37.463 --> 36:38.697
- THIS IS NOT EXACTLY

36:38.730 --> 36:43.502
THE ROYAL BALLET
OF PITTSBURGH.

36:43.535 --> 36:46.372
- BUT IT'S MY JOB.

36:46.405 --> 36:49.007
NO, IT'S MORE THAN A JOB.

36:49.040 --> 36:53.345
IT'S WHO I AM.

36:53.379 --> 36:56.348
AND I WANT IT BACK.

36:56.382 --> 36:58.917
- [sighs]

36:58.950 --> 37:01.487
I-I WAS JUST...

37:01.520 --> 37:03.989
TRYING TO MAKE IT
EASIER ON YOU, HONEY.

37:04.022 --> 37:08.527
BUT IF THIS'LL MAKE
YOU HAPPY...

37:08.560 --> 37:10.362
[laughs]

37:10.396 --> 37:12.030
LIKE I SAID,

37:12.063 --> 37:14.333
I'LL STAND BY YOU.

37:14.366 --> 37:17.603
I'M NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

37:17.636 --> 37:21.273
- THANK YOU, CARL.

37:23.375 --> 37:24.910
NOW, YOU'RE SURE
YOU'RE OKAY WITH THIS?

37:24.943 --> 37:26.745
- [scoffs]

37:26.778 --> 37:28.647
100% SURE.

37:28.680 --> 37:30.382
- GOOD...

37:30.416 --> 37:32.818
'CAUSE MY SHIFT STARTED
FIVE MINUTES AGO.

37:32.851 --> 37:35.887
- [laughs]

37:35.921 --> 37:37.623
SO...

37:37.656 --> 37:38.624
WHAT'LL IT BE?

37:38.657 --> 37:41.293
[both laughing]

37:41.327 --> 37:45.431
[both groaning, grunting]

37:51.537 --> 37:54.473
- [chuckling]

37:58.076 --> 38:00.679
WHOO!

38:00.712 --> 38:01.680
THAT WAS HOT!

38:01.713 --> 38:04.082
[groans]

38:04.115 --> 38:05.517
- THINK SO?

38:05.551 --> 38:07.719
- [panting]
YEAH...

38:09.955 --> 38:13.392
YOU KNOW,
I'VE BEEN HERE BEFORE.

38:13.425 --> 38:15.594
- OH?

38:15.627 --> 38:17.095
- I MEAN
IN THIS BUILDING.

38:17.128 --> 38:20.732
FUCKED SOME POOR LOSER.

38:20.766 --> 38:22.601
- YEAH, WELL...

38:22.634 --> 38:24.436
THE PLACE IS CRAWLING
WITH THEM.

38:24.470 --> 38:25.671
BELIEVE ME, I KNOW.

38:25.704 --> 38:27.806
- [laughs]

38:27.839 --> 38:30.942
ONE OF MY PITY FUCKS.

38:30.976 --> 38:32.411
- YEAH, SPEAKING
OF PITY FUCKS--

38:32.444 --> 38:33.845
- YOU KNOW,

38:33.879 --> 38:36.415
WHEN WE FIRST HOOKED UP
AT THE GYM,

38:36.448 --> 38:37.416
I WASN'T SURE.

38:37.449 --> 38:38.950
- THAT I WAS YOUR TYPE?

38:38.984 --> 38:42.721
- THAT YOU'D BE SO HOT.

38:42.754 --> 38:46.124
BUT, MAN, ARE YOU EVER.

38:46.157 --> 38:47.959
LOOK.

38:47.993 --> 38:51.763
I'M STILL HARD.

38:51.797 --> 38:55.701
YOU UP FOR ANOTHER ROUND?

38:55.734 --> 38:57.903
- ACTUALLY THERE'S SOMETHING
I WANT TO SAY TO YOU.

38:57.936 --> 39:00.939
- THAT YOU WANT TO ROLL ME
OVER AND FUCK ME AGAIN?

39:05.076 --> 39:08.880
- WHAT I WANT TO--

39:08.914 --> 39:12.150
WHAT I WANT TO SAY TO--
TO YOU...

39:12.183 --> 39:16.722
IS, UH...

39:16.755 --> 39:19.090
ROLL OVER.

39:22.160 --> 39:23.895
- OH, YEAH.

39:25.564 --> 39:27.766
- MICHAEL, WE CAN'T FORCE HIM
TO GO TO SCHOOL.

39:27.799 --> 39:29.468
- OF COURSE WE CAN.
WE'RE HIS PARENTS.

39:29.501 --> 39:30.802
HELL, HE'S ONLY 17.

39:30.836 --> 39:32.471
- YOU CAN QUIT SCHOOL
WHEN YOU'RE 16.

39:32.504 --> 39:34.139
BESIDES, IF WE PRESSURE HIM,

39:34.172 --> 39:35.907
WE'LL ONLY PUSH HIM AWAY MORE.

39:35.941 --> 39:37.609
- HE'S GOT TO FINISH
HIGH SCHOOL,

39:37.643 --> 39:38.777
SO HE CAN GO TO COLLEGE

39:38.810 --> 39:40.512
AND BECOME
A DOCTOR AND A LAWYER

39:40.546 --> 39:42.814
AND PRESIDENT OF
THE UNITED STATES.

39:45.817 --> 39:47.486
WHAT WAS THAT FOR?
- THE ETERNAL OPTIMIST.

39:47.519 --> 39:49.020
THAT'S WHY I LOVE YOU.

39:49.054 --> 39:51.523
NOW, LET'S JUST GIVE HIM
SOME TIME AND SOME SPACE,

39:51.557 --> 39:54.660
AND HOPEFULLY HE'LL COME
TO THE RIGHT DECISION.

40:01.533 --> 40:05.571
- OH. HEY, I WAS JUST ABOUT
TO CALL YOU FOR DINNER.

40:05.604 --> 40:07.072
JUST BECAUSE I SAID
WE'RE HAVING SLOPPY JOES

40:07.105 --> 40:08.774
DOESN'T MEAN WE'RE GOING
TO GO CAMPING.

40:08.807 --> 40:09.908
- GOING SOMEWHERE?

40:09.941 --> 40:11.777
- YEAH.

40:11.810 --> 40:12.844
- WELL, EAT FIRST

40:12.878 --> 40:14.680
AND DON'T BE OUT TOO LATE.

40:14.713 --> 40:18.517
- I MEAN I'M LEAVING.

40:18.550 --> 40:20.018
FOR GOOD.

40:23.489 --> 40:24.790
- WH--WHAT DO YOU
MEAN YOU'RE--

40:24.823 --> 40:27.225
- I CAN'T STAY HERE
ANYMORE, OKAY?

40:27.258 --> 40:29.194
- NO, IT'S NOT OKAY.

40:29.227 --> 40:32.564
NOW PUT YOUR THINGS AWAY
AND SIT DOWN AND EAT,

40:32.598 --> 40:34.533
AND AFTERWARDS
WE'LL DISCUSS THIS.

40:34.566 --> 40:37.068
- WE'VE ALREADY DISCUSSED IT.
THERE'S NOTHING LEFT TO SAY.

40:37.102 --> 40:38.670
- WELL, I SAID YOU'RE
NOT GOING ANYWHERE,

40:38.704 --> 40:39.938
AND THAT'S FINAL!
- HEY, MICHAEL, MICHAEL.

40:39.971 --> 40:41.607
- WHAT?
HE CAN'T JUST LEAVE!

40:41.640 --> 40:43.475
WE'RE HIS PARENTS,
FOR CHRIST'S SAKES,

40:43.509 --> 40:45.577
WHETHER HE LIKES IT OR NOT.
WE'RE HIS LEGAL GUARDIANS.

40:45.611 --> 40:46.945
WHAT WE SAY GOES.
- HUNTER, HUNTER,

40:46.978 --> 40:48.847
NOTHING IS GOING TO BE SOLVED
BY RUNNING AWAY.

40:48.880 --> 40:51.149
- I DON'T BELONG HERE!
I DON'T BELONG IN THIS HOUSE,

40:51.182 --> 40:53.619
I DON'T BELONG AT THAT SCHOOL.
AND I DON'T BELONG WITH YOU!

40:53.652 --> 40:55.554
- OF COURSE YOU BELONG
WITH US.

40:55.587 --> 40:58.089
- I'LL ONLY GO ON
CAUSING YOU PROBLEMS,

40:58.123 --> 40:59.491
EMBARRASSING YOU.

40:59.525 --> 41:00.959
- YOU DON'T EMBARRASS US.

41:00.992 --> 41:02.027
WE'RE PROUD OF YOU.

41:02.060 --> 41:03.562
- THIS I-IS NOT
THE DEBATE TEAM.

41:03.595 --> 41:05.030
THERE'S NO ARGUMENT HERE,

41:05.063 --> 41:09.134
EXCEPT DO YOU WANT APPLESAUCE
OR CANNED PEACHES?

41:09.167 --> 41:11.036
HUNTER!

41:11.069 --> 41:14.139
I DON'T CARE IF I HAVE TO LOCK
YOU IN YOUR FUCKING ROOM.

41:19.611 --> 41:21.146
- WHERE'RE YOU GOING TO GO?
- I DON'T KNOW.

41:21.179 --> 41:22.714
- DO YOU HAVE ANY MONEY?

41:22.748 --> 41:24.583
- WHAT YOU AND MICHAEL GAVE ME
FOR MY BIRTHDAY.

41:24.616 --> 41:26.017
- NO PLAN, NO MONEY.
PERFECT.

41:26.051 --> 41:27.653
HOW DO YOU INTEND
TO SUPPORT YOURSELF?

41:27.686 --> 41:28.720
- I'LL THINK OF SOMETHING.

41:28.754 --> 41:31.857
- I BET YOU WILL.

41:31.890 --> 41:34.726
- HEY. HEY.

41:34.760 --> 41:38.664
IF YOU NEED MORE, CALL US.

41:38.697 --> 41:40.799
- WHAT THE FUCK
ARE YOU DOING?

41:49.174 --> 41:51.076
HUNTER, WAIT.

41:55.781 --> 41:58.717
JUST PUT IT IN YOUR SHOE,
SOMEPLACE SAFE.

42:08.827 --> 42:09.928
[door closes]

42:15.601 --> 42:17.302
- HOT OR NOT?

42:17.335 --> 42:18.937
- IT'S HOT.

42:22.340 --> 42:25.543
- NOW, THAT'S WHAT I CALL
A RESOUNDING APPROVAL.

42:28.680 --> 42:30.181
- BY THE WAY, WE SOLD
OUT EVERY LAST COPY

42:30.215 --> 42:32.317
OF THE MARRIAGE ISSUE,

42:32.350 --> 42:36.722
AND WE GOT ORDERS
FOR OVER 300 MORE.

42:36.755 --> 42:38.256
- IF NOT HAVING ANY BALLS

42:38.289 --> 42:42.794
IS WHAT IT TAKES TO BE
A GAY SUPERHERO THESE DAYS,

42:42.828 --> 42:47.866
I'D WARN RAGE TO GET
THE HELL OUT OF GAYOPOLIS.

42:47.899 --> 42:50.068
- YOU KNOW, IF YOU DIDN'T
STAY OUT ALL NIGHT FUCKING,

42:50.101 --> 42:51.937
MAYBE YOU WOULDN'T
BE SO CRANKY.

42:51.970 --> 42:53.338
- WHO SAID I WAS FUCKING?

42:53.371 --> 42:54.940
- YOU?

42:54.973 --> 42:59.845
I'M SURE THERE MUST
HAVE BEEN SOMEONE.

42:59.878 --> 43:01.212
- YEAH.

43:01.246 --> 43:03.682
AND SOMEBODY
ELSE GOT HIM.

43:03.715 --> 43:06.885
- FINALLY,
SOME COMPETITION.

43:14.325 --> 43:17.162
- I DON'T THINK
YOU GET IT.

43:17.195 --> 43:19.765
- WHAT? THAT SOMEONE
REJECTED YOU?

43:19.798 --> 43:22.033
GOT THE PRIME
PIECE OF MEAT?

43:22.067 --> 43:24.335
IT HAPPENS TO EVERYONE.

43:27.405 --> 43:29.708
- ONE LITTLE GESTURE.

43:29.741 --> 43:33.645
EASILY OVERLOOKED.

43:33.679 --> 43:35.914
[grunts]
BUT THE MEANING IS CLEAR.

43:35.947 --> 43:41.119
IT'S STARTED.

43:41.152 --> 43:44.155
IT'S BEGUN.

43:49.427 --> 43:51.697
[clattering]

43:55.300 --> 43:57.368
[clears throat]

43:59.838 --> 44:01.907
HOW ABOUT THIS ONE?

44:12.784 --> 44:14.753
- YOU KNOW,

44:14.786 --> 44:16.287
WHEN I WAS IN L.A.,
FUCKING AROUND,

44:16.321 --> 44:18.023
IT WAS FUN AND ALL.

44:18.056 --> 44:21.059
BUT WHEN
I CAME BACK HERE

44:21.092 --> 44:22.894
AND YOU SAID
THE OFFER STILL STANDS

44:22.928 --> 44:27.465
AND TO PUT MY STUFF
IN THE DRAWER...

44:27.498 --> 44:30.035
I WAS HOPING IT MEANT

44:30.068 --> 44:35.206
WE WERE FINALLY GOING
TO BE A REAL COUPLE,

44:35.240 --> 44:37.375
LIKE MICHAEL AND BEN.

44:37.408 --> 44:41.312
ONE DAY WE MIGHT HAVE
THE THINGS THEY HAVE.

44:41.346 --> 44:44.349
A HOUSE...

44:44.382 --> 44:46.718
MAYBE EVEN A FAMILY.

44:59.297 --> 45:02.801
- HOW'S THIS?

45:21.419 --> 45:23.121
HOT.

45:25.991 --> 45:30.095
*

45:30.128 --> 45:33.364
* I CAN'T THINK STRAIGHT

45:33.398 --> 45:37.435
* HELP ME NOW
BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE *

45:37.468 --> 45:41.306
* NOW WHAT DO I CARE?

45:41.339 --> 45:44.509
* 'CAUSE
WE'RE GOING NOWHERE *
