WEBVTT

00:18.885 --> 00:21.520
I do.
I do?

00:21.522 --> 00:23.322
I thought this whole marriage
thing was just gonna be

00:23.324 --> 00:25.791
an absolute disaster,
but it's surprisingly

00:25.793 --> 00:27.059
tolerable.
Whoa!

00:27.061 --> 00:28.794
(both scream)

00:34.834 --> 00:37.202
Hello?

00:37.204 --> 00:39.705
Hello in there?

00:48.681 --> 00:49.815
Are you okay?

00:49.817 --> 00:52.051
Uh...
CAROL:
Phil!

00:52.053 --> 00:54.053
Wait, is there
someone else in your car?

00:54.055 --> 00:55.554
CAROL: Can't get
my seatbelt off.

00:55.556 --> 00:57.322
Oh... (chuckles)
She's fine.
(Carol screams)

00:57.324 --> 00:58.724
Oh, my God!

00:58.726 --> 01:00.859
Oh, yeah, uh, Carol,
get out of that truck.

01:00.861 --> 01:03.228
(laughing):
There's another person on Earth!

01:03.230 --> 01:04.496
(whoops)
Yeah, I know.

01:04.498 --> 01:06.031
I know, I know,
I know, I know.

01:06.033 --> 01:07.933
Are you okay?
I just, uh,

01:07.935 --> 01:09.268
banged my knee, I think.

01:09.270 --> 01:10.836
Well, here,
put your arm around me.

01:10.838 --> 01:13.038
Come on, we got to get
away from this car.

01:13.040 --> 01:14.440
CAROL: I can't
believe you're here.

01:14.442 --> 01:15.941
Phil, can you
believe it?

01:15.943 --> 01:17.342
There's another person!

01:17.344 --> 01:19.211
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

01:19.213 --> 01:20.446
Come on, let's
get in my car.

01:20.448 --> 01:21.847
Shotgun!

01:27.020 --> 01:28.187
Wh...

01:28.189 --> 01:29.588
Phil?

01:29.590 --> 01:31.390
I called it!

01:31.392 --> 01:33.659
We'll just go over here.
It's fine.

01:41.701 --> 01:43.035
Hey, how you doing back there?

01:43.037 --> 01:44.870
Oh, I'm great.
Would you believe

01:44.872 --> 01:46.705
this is my first ride
in a limousine?

01:46.707 --> 01:48.073
I feel like

01:48.075 --> 01:50.042
Imelda Marcos back here.

01:50.044 --> 01:51.743
I'm Carol, by the way.
That's Phil.

01:51.745 --> 01:53.112
Hi.

01:53.114 --> 01:54.446
I'm Melissa.

01:54.448 --> 01:56.081
What brings you to Arizona?

01:56.083 --> 01:58.383
Oh, you know,
the unbearable heat,

01:58.385 --> 02:00.119
lack of water.

02:00.121 --> 02:02.421
(laughs)
CAROL: See, that's
the exact reason why

02:02.423 --> 02:03.789
I wouldn't want to come, but...

02:03.791 --> 02:05.891
No, I saw these
billboards that said

02:05.893 --> 02:07.326
"Alive in Tucson," so I decided

02:07.328 --> 02:09.161
to give it a shot.
Those are Phil's.

02:09.163 --> 02:10.429
Oh, yeah? You did those?

02:10.431 --> 02:12.331
That was a really
smart idea.

02:12.333 --> 02:15.100
Mm. I mean... whatever.
(laughs)

02:15.102 --> 02:17.069
I wish you would have put
your address on them, though.

02:17.071 --> 02:20.072
I've been here two weeks,
just driving around.

02:20.074 --> 02:23.108
Wait, y-you've
been here for two weeks?

02:23.110 --> 02:26.311
So you were here before me?
That's funny.

02:26.313 --> 02:28.614
Yeah, Phil, you should've
put your address

02:28.616 --> 02:29.681
on the sign.

02:29.683 --> 02:32.317
Yup. Should've done that.

02:32.319 --> 02:33.619
That's okay, though.

02:33.621 --> 02:36.121
Couple days here,
couple days there.

02:36.123 --> 02:38.157
What would have
really been different?

02:38.159 --> 02:39.858
Yeah.

02:39.860 --> 02:42.194
Except you could have been
a guest at our wedding.

02:42.196 --> 02:44.163
Oh, you... you guys are married?

02:44.165 --> 02:46.298
I mean...
Yup. Tied the knot.

02:46.300 --> 02:47.699
(clicks tongue)
Well, wait,

02:47.701 --> 02:49.635
you've known each other,
like, a week, right?

02:49.637 --> 02:51.170
Yeah.
Wow.

02:51.172 --> 02:53.539
Yeah.
You guys don't
mess around.

02:53.541 --> 02:55.007
Yes, we do.
(laughs)

02:55.009 --> 02:56.141
Carol...

02:56.143 --> 02:57.643
We had a awkward
patch at first,

02:57.645 --> 02:59.978
but, oh, we have been really

02:59.980 --> 03:02.181
jelling lately.
It's not uncommon

03:02.183 --> 03:05.517
for us to finish each other's...

03:05.519 --> 03:07.319
That's a cool function.

03:07.321 --> 03:09.188
So when Carol says marriage...

03:09.190 --> 03:10.289
...sentences!

03:10.291 --> 03:11.690
The-the little window went up.

03:11.692 --> 03:13.192
Did you guys
see that? Ha.

03:13.194 --> 03:14.893
Yeah, we're literally
in the honeymoon phase.

03:14.895 --> 03:16.395
We're trying to have

03:16.397 --> 03:18.997
a baby, so you know what
that means-- nonstop...

03:18.999 --> 03:21.066
Oop. The window's
going up again.

03:21.068 --> 03:22.334
Wait, am I pushing

03:22.336 --> 03:24.970
<i>the window? I'm not pushing it.</i>

03:25.805 --> 03:29.041
So, uh, this is Chez Phil.

03:29.043 --> 03:31.243
Wow.

03:32.412 --> 03:34.580
Holy crap,
is that <i>Water Lilies?</i>

03:34.582 --> 03:36.682
Yup.
It's stolen.

03:36.684 --> 03:38.483
Phil stole

03:38.485 --> 03:39.585
all of this.

03:39.587 --> 03:41.553
Well, is it
really stealing

03:41.555 --> 03:44.656
if there are no people left?
That's what I said.

03:44.658 --> 03:46.925
Well, I could really use
some rest. Where should I stay?

03:46.927 --> 03:48.427
Well, you should probably
stay right here, right?

03:48.429 --> 03:50.195
You know, it's probably
good to have

03:50.197 --> 03:51.496
somebody watching over you
in case

03:51.498 --> 03:53.031
you got a concussion
or something.

03:53.033 --> 03:54.499
I-I don't have a concussion.

03:54.501 --> 03:55.867
(chuckles)
That's what people always say

03:55.869 --> 03:57.336
when they got a little
concush brewing.

03:57.338 --> 03:59.071
I definitely don't have one.
Think about it.

03:59.073 --> 04:00.505
(clears throat)

04:00.507 --> 04:03.342
S-So can I just
take any house? Or...

04:03.344 --> 04:05.043
Well, this one's Phil's.

04:05.045 --> 04:08.447
And mine's the one across
the street with the broken door.

04:08.449 --> 04:09.881
(laughs)
Because...

04:09.883 --> 04:11.183
Phil broke it.

04:11.185 --> 04:13.619
I'm gonna fix your door, Carol.
(laughs)

04:13.621 --> 04:17.422
Well, he's not very handy,
so I'm not gonna hold my breast.

04:17.424 --> 04:19.057
Breath.

04:19.059 --> 04:21.526
Why would I hold my breath?
I would die.

04:21.528 --> 04:23.095
Carol, why would you
hold your breast?

04:23.097 --> 04:24.596
Oh. No...
It's "holding your
breath" because

04:24.598 --> 04:26.265
there's danger if you
hold your breath.

04:26.267 --> 04:27.699
I wouldn't.
That's what I'm saying.

04:27.701 --> 04:30.535
So the house with
the broken door is yours.

04:30.537 --> 04:31.703
Yeah.

04:31.705 --> 04:34.306
But every other one
is available.

04:34.308 --> 04:35.641
I would avoid the white one,

04:35.643 --> 04:37.309
because Phil uses the pool
as a toilet.

04:37.311 --> 04:40.479
Carol...
What? It's the truth.

04:40.481 --> 04:43.148
You know... she just
got here. It's...

04:43.150 --> 04:45.384
But the toilet pool's
the first thing you showed <i>me.</i>

04:45.386 --> 04:47.319
But... Yeah, but you don't have
to tell her,

04:47.321 --> 04:49.087
you know, the...
Okay, I'm sorry.

04:49.089 --> 04:52.391
I shouldn't have put Phil's
business out on the streets.

04:52.393 --> 04:53.592
But don't go swimming in there.

04:53.594 --> 04:55.494
I'll try to resist the urge.

04:55.496 --> 04:57.829
Yeah.
Thanks. Okay.

04:57.831 --> 04:59.931
You go have yourself
a good snooze, okay?

04:59.933 --> 05:01.166
And when you wake up,

05:01.168 --> 05:02.901
why don't you
drop by for dinner?

05:02.903 --> 05:04.336
(gasps)
Dinner's a great idea.

05:04.338 --> 05:06.772
Oh, yeah.
You come, too, Carol, sure.

05:06.774 --> 05:09.474
I still can't believe this.
This is...

05:09.476 --> 05:11.943
Never thought
I'd see people again.

05:11.945 --> 05:13.745
And you two sure are...

05:15.415 --> 05:17.349
you know... people.

05:17.351 --> 05:18.617
Come here.

05:18.619 --> 05:20.652
Oh.

05:20.654 --> 05:22.921
Hey, I want to
get in on this.

05:22.923 --> 05:25.390
(laughs): Okay.
Mm.

05:26.659 --> 05:28.093
Mm.

05:31.030 --> 05:33.498
Okay, that's my limit, probably.

05:33.500 --> 05:35.000
Okay.
All right.

05:35.002 --> 05:37.202
Thanks.

05:38.271 --> 05:41.173
She's nice.
I like her. Yeah.

05:42.608 --> 05:44.810
And voilà. There you have it.

05:44.812 --> 05:47.446
The world-famous
Pilbasian casserole.

05:47.448 --> 05:48.980
So what-what's in that?

05:48.982 --> 05:51.183
Well, you got your raisin balls,
canned tomato sauce,

05:51.185 --> 05:52.851
mint chutney and then

05:52.853 --> 05:54.853
potato chips for mouth feel.

05:54.855 --> 05:56.321
You want to try some?

05:56.323 --> 05:58.323
Yes.

05:58.325 --> 06:02.127
Okay. Let's get all that
tomato sauce and then...

06:02.129 --> 06:03.962
Mmm.

06:03.964 --> 06:05.831
It's a juicy one.

06:05.833 --> 06:07.966
Mm.
Mm.

06:09.635 --> 06:10.836
Mmm.

06:10.838 --> 06:12.704
Uh-huh. I knew
you'd love it.

06:12.706 --> 06:14.206
Mm-hmm.

06:14.208 --> 06:15.574
(laughs)

06:15.576 --> 06:18.677
Phil, what's taking
you so long?!

06:18.679 --> 06:19.911
PHIL:
Be right down.

06:19.913 --> 06:21.580
He's probably
deciding

06:21.582 --> 06:24.249
between his cargo shorts
and his sweatpants.

06:25.084 --> 06:26.518
I'm predicting cargo shorts.

06:26.520 --> 06:27.986
But you never
know with Phil.

06:27.988 --> 06:30.088
Could be sweatpants, too.
I don't know.

06:30.090 --> 06:32.391
PHIL:
Hello, ladies.

06:39.098 --> 06:42.367
Phil Miller.
What's gotten into you?

06:42.369 --> 06:43.935
I don't know what
you're talking about, Carol.

06:43.937 --> 06:47.038
Just coming down
for dinner, as I do.

06:47.040 --> 06:48.440
So you got rid of the beard.

06:48.442 --> 06:49.708
Yes, I did.

06:49.710 --> 06:51.376
Thought that was
kind of cool.

06:51.378 --> 06:53.211
You did? Oh.

06:53.213 --> 06:54.880
CAROL:
Yeah, your chin is

06:54.882 --> 06:58.049
too pointy; you just need
something to smooth it out.

06:58.051 --> 07:00.285
And you feel the same...
way about that?

07:00.287 --> 07:01.520
MELISSA:
Yeah, you look smaller.

07:01.522 --> 07:03.054
Weaker.

07:03.056 --> 07:04.856
M'kay. (chuckles)

07:04.858 --> 07:06.224
Who do you look like?

07:06.226 --> 07:07.692
Quentin Tarantino.

07:07.694 --> 07:10.462
Uh, okay, yeah, yeah.
I don't see that, but...

07:10.464 --> 07:12.597
k.d. lang, isn't it?
Oh, k.d...
It's k.d. lang.

07:12.599 --> 07:15.434
k.d. lang, the-the
female country singer?

07:15.436 --> 07:16.802
Mm-hmm.
Yeah.

07:16.804 --> 07:18.737
Well, I like it.
(chuckles)

07:18.739 --> 07:20.539
Well, you don't
have to look at it.

07:20.541 --> 07:22.441
I guess I don't.

07:22.443 --> 07:24.509
Uh, shall we eat?

07:29.415 --> 07:31.349
(smooth jazz playing quietly)

07:35.154 --> 07:37.422
So, uh... tell us
more about yourself.

07:37.424 --> 07:38.924
Who is Melissa...

07:38.926 --> 07:40.325
What's your last name?

07:40.327 --> 07:42.761
Shart.
Sharp?

07:42.763 --> 07:44.129
Shart.

07:44.131 --> 07:45.330
Shart.

07:46.799 --> 07:48.166
Beautiful name.

07:48.168 --> 07:49.768
So who is

07:49.770 --> 07:52.737
Melissa Shart?
What makes her tick?

07:52.739 --> 07:54.473
Well, I grew up in Akron.

07:54.475 --> 07:56.107
Ohio.
Yes.

07:56.109 --> 07:57.309
Yup.

07:57.311 --> 07:58.510
And then went to UNLV.

07:58.512 --> 08:00.312
Go, Runnin' Rebels. (chuckles)

08:00.314 --> 08:02.614
Yeah, that's the mascot.

08:02.616 --> 08:05.817
I know it well.
I know it well.

08:05.819 --> 08:07.652
Our mascot was St. Peter.

08:08.521 --> 08:10.522
I went to a Catholic university.

08:11.357 --> 08:13.525
He was fierce.

08:13.527 --> 08:15.126
Mm-hmm.

08:15.128 --> 08:16.862
Go on. Go on.

08:16.864 --> 08:18.763
Well, I was a real estate agent.

08:19.665 --> 08:21.032
So if you're looking to move,

08:21.034 --> 08:22.834
right now is a buyer's market.

08:22.836 --> 08:24.336
(laughs)

08:24.338 --> 08:25.670
That's very funny.

08:25.672 --> 08:27.038
That's a good joke.
(laughs)

08:27.040 --> 08:29.140
No, but it's been weird.
It's been hard.

08:29.142 --> 08:31.443
No, no, no. I know.
We shouldn't joke about that.

08:31.445 --> 08:32.511
But we have to laugh about it.

08:32.513 --> 08:33.845
Best medicine. Got to laugh.

08:33.847 --> 08:35.013
Got to joke about it.

08:35.015 --> 08:36.681
Yeah.
Yeah. Hey,

08:36.683 --> 08:39.317
I-I just want to apologize
for smashing up your limo.

08:39.319 --> 08:41.720
I feel just awful about that.

08:41.722 --> 08:44.055
Oh, don't even worry about it.
I don't care about that thing.

08:44.057 --> 08:47.325
You sure?
Now, if it had been my old VW
Bug, we would've had a problem.

08:47.327 --> 08:49.127
Wait, you used to have a VW Bug?

08:49.129 --> 08:51.029
Yeah.
I used to have a VW Bug!

08:51.031 --> 08:53.131
You did?
Yeah, I did. (laughs)

08:53.133 --> 08:54.699
That's such a fun thing
to have in common.

08:54.701 --> 08:56.835
MELISSA: Yeah.
Couple of Bug owners here.

08:56.837 --> 08:58.303
Yeah.

08:58.305 --> 08:59.337
Which one did you have?

08:59.339 --> 09:01.740
(laughs)

09:03.175 --> 09:04.910
Okay, well, full disclosure,

09:04.912 --> 09:06.912
it was actually
my buddy's sister's Bug.

09:07.914 --> 09:09.648
And it was a... a Jetta.

09:09.650 --> 09:12.083
But, uh, God, I logged
some serious hours in there.

09:12.085 --> 09:13.818
Love those things.

09:14.720 --> 09:17.322
Great cars.
Yeah.

09:17.324 --> 09:20.258
So, uh, Melissa,

09:20.260 --> 09:23.361
were you married
in the old world?

09:23.363 --> 09:26.765
Yes, I was married once,
to a jerk named Greg.

09:26.767 --> 09:29.501
Cheated on me with a cop.

09:29.503 --> 09:32.037
Friggin' cheaters.

09:32.039 --> 09:33.772
I'm so sorry
you went through that.

09:33.774 --> 09:35.240
No, it was all for the best.

09:35.242 --> 09:36.541
Yeah.
He wasn't my type anyway.

09:36.543 --> 09:38.843
And what is your type?

09:38.845 --> 09:41.947
Just a man's man. A provider.

09:41.949 --> 09:45.083
Duly noted.

09:45.085 --> 09:47.252
Um...
Oh, uh,

09:47.254 --> 09:48.954
for... Carol, you know?

09:48.956 --> 09:51.957
Trying to make myself
a better husband for that woman.

09:51.959 --> 09:53.525
MELISSA:
And you should.

09:53.527 --> 09:55.360
'Cause, Carol, you seem
like a really great lady.

09:55.362 --> 09:57.762
Thank you.

09:57.764 --> 09:59.864
Well, and I-I think
Greg's crazy,

09:59.866 --> 10:02.367
because you, Melissa,
are a catch.

10:02.369 --> 10:04.436
Like, a Moby Dick-sized catch.

10:04.438 --> 10:06.438
Moby Dick?

10:06.440 --> 10:07.973
Try Moby Double Dick.

10:07.975 --> 10:09.874
Well, I'm gonna get to bed.

10:09.876 --> 10:11.810
Thank you.

10:11.812 --> 10:14.446
Dinner was... Thank you.

10:14.448 --> 10:16.247
Walk you home?
I'm good.

10:16.249 --> 10:17.382
How about another group hug?

10:17.384 --> 10:19.217
Rain check.
(laughs)

10:19.219 --> 10:21.052
Well, I'm gonna collect.

10:21.054 --> 10:22.988
Believe you me.

10:22.990 --> 10:25.724
Like a tax man
collecting hug tax.

10:25.726 --> 10:27.392
I will collect.

10:28.661 --> 10:30.829
So, you ready to
take the train

10:30.831 --> 10:33.164
to repopulation
station?

10:33.166 --> 10:35.967
Without your beard,
you're like a whole new man.

10:35.969 --> 10:38.503
It's like I'm cheating
on my husband.

10:38.505 --> 10:40.805
Which I would never, ever do.

10:40.807 --> 10:43.008
Yeah, uh, look,
I'm sorry, Carol,

10:43.010 --> 10:44.676
I-I really don't
feel like it tonight.

10:44.678 --> 10:47.078
I think I ate something
that didn't agree with me.

10:47.080 --> 10:48.847
Oh.

10:50.249 --> 10:51.816
Is it diarrhea?

10:51.818 --> 10:54.152
Carol, can we please not talk
about this?

10:54.154 --> 10:56.354
Phil, I'm your wife,
and I want you to know

10:56.356 --> 10:59.424
that you can always tell me
about your diarrhea.

10:59.426 --> 11:01.159
Carol...
You can,

11:01.161 --> 11:02.927
and I'll tell you
if I ever have it.

11:02.929 --> 11:03.962
It's part of the deal.

11:03.964 --> 11:05.764
It's why people get married.

11:05.766 --> 11:07.999
So they can tell each other
stuff like that.

11:08.001 --> 11:10.001
Carol, look, I don't
have diarrhea, okay?

11:10.003 --> 11:12.537
My stomach is
just upset.

11:12.539 --> 11:14.272
But I promise you,
as your husband,

11:14.274 --> 11:16.007
the moment I have diarrhea,

11:16.009 --> 11:19.044
I will march on over to your
house and tell you all about it.

11:19.046 --> 11:21.112
And I look forward
to hearing about yours.

11:21.114 --> 11:22.681
Promise?

11:22.683 --> 11:23.815
I promise.

11:23.817 --> 11:25.517
(quietly):
Okay.

11:27.186 --> 11:28.520
Hey, Phil?

11:28.522 --> 11:30.321
What?

11:30.323 --> 11:32.957
Are you attracted to Melissa?

11:33.793 --> 11:36.027
Honestly?

11:37.530 --> 11:39.798
No.

11:43.569 --> 11:45.804
Okay.

11:45.806 --> 11:47.505
(kissing)

11:47.507 --> 11:49.474
(snoring)

11:49.476 --> 11:51.176
(knocking on door)

11:51.178 --> 11:52.811
MELISSA (whispers):
Phil!

11:54.046 --> 11:55.547
Come here.

11:56.415 --> 11:58.616
I want to show you something.

12:02.822 --> 12:04.522
(giggles)

12:04.524 --> 12:06.324
(echoes):
This way.

12:08.094 --> 12:10.328
♪

12:10.830 --> 12:13.431
(giggles)

12:22.074 --> 12:24.209
Hi, Phil. Guess what I have?

12:24.211 --> 12:25.677
Starts with a "D."

12:25.679 --> 12:27.278
(laughing, toilet flushing)
<i>Diarrhea.</i>

12:27.280 --> 12:29.581
(Phil screaming)
<i>Diarrhea, diarrhea, diarrhea!</i>

12:29.583 --> 12:31.082
(screams)

12:32.418 --> 12:34.252
(whimpers)

12:38.257 --> 12:39.524
(Phil panting)

12:39.526 --> 12:41.493
PHIL:
Come in.

12:43.028 --> 12:44.662
Oh, hey, Melissa.

12:45.931 --> 12:47.599
What can I do you for?

12:47.601 --> 12:48.900
Can you come with me?

12:48.902 --> 12:50.401
Yeah, hang on one sec.

12:50.403 --> 12:52.604
(grunts)
Almost done with my set.

12:52.606 --> 12:54.873
Got to get those reps in. Ha.

12:54.875 --> 12:57.208
(straining):
391...

12:57.210 --> 12:59.744
392...

12:59.746 --> 13:00.879
three-ninety...

13:00.881 --> 13:03.314
(grunt) ...three.

13:03.316 --> 13:04.549
(groans)

13:04.551 --> 13:06.918
393-- that's my number.

13:06.920 --> 13:08.453
Let's do it.

13:13.058 --> 13:14.626
Phil, what is this?

13:14.628 --> 13:16.127
I don't know.

13:16.129 --> 13:18.396
Must be from
the Volkswagen fairy.

13:19.598 --> 13:20.899
No biggie.

13:20.901 --> 13:22.400
You know, I felt bad
about the limo,

13:22.402 --> 13:23.735
and so I made right.

13:23.737 --> 13:24.936
That's how I do.

13:24.938 --> 13:27.071
I'm a provider like that.

13:27.073 --> 13:28.940
You really didn't
have to do that.

13:28.942 --> 13:30.642
I don't do things
'cause I have to.

13:30.644 --> 13:31.943
CAROL:
Phil!

13:31.945 --> 13:33.645
Can I see you for a second?!

13:33.647 --> 13:35.079
Sure, Carol!

13:35.081 --> 13:36.614
Anything for you!

13:36.616 --> 13:38.283
So devoted to her.

13:38.285 --> 13:41.753
Phil!
I said I'm coming, Carol!

13:44.423 --> 13:45.957
You shouted?

13:45.959 --> 13:47.525
You bought Melissa a car?

13:47.527 --> 13:49.828
Yeah, Carol.
I smashed up her limo.

13:49.830 --> 13:51.696
So you have all the time
to do that,

13:51.698 --> 13:54.933
but you couldn't take the time
to fix my door?

13:54.935 --> 13:57.602
Carol, this door is broken
in a way that cannot be fixed.

13:57.604 --> 13:59.671
Okay, it was broken
from the start,

13:59.673 --> 14:02.473
so maybe it's time
to think about moving on.

14:02.475 --> 14:05.610
Phil, when something's broken,
you don't just throw it away.

14:05.612 --> 14:07.378
Okay, you work on it
and you fix it.

14:07.380 --> 14:09.480
Fine, Carol.

14:09.482 --> 14:10.815
I'll fix the stupid door.

14:10.817 --> 14:12.383
Fine. Fine!
Fine.

14:12.385 --> 14:14.519
Fine! Fine!
Fine! Fine!

14:14.521 --> 14:15.720
(yells)

14:20.559 --> 14:23.361
Locked in a pretty serious
battle with Carol's door.

14:23.363 --> 14:25.496
Gonna pop down
to the hardware store,

14:25.498 --> 14:26.898
uh, pick up some supplies,

14:26.900 --> 14:28.900
gonna get some two by's,
some four by's,

14:28.902 --> 14:30.368
nails for sure,

14:30.370 --> 14:32.570
a Wilson Phillips head
screwdriver...
A what?

14:32.572 --> 14:34.906
A Wilson Phillips head
screwdriver.

14:34.908 --> 14:36.608
You mean a Phillips head
screwdriver.

14:37.509 --> 14:39.177
Wilson Phillips was a band.

14:39.179 --> 14:40.478
(laughs)

14:40.480 --> 14:42.547
They named a band
after a screwdriver.

14:42.549 --> 14:43.882
Cool. Well, uh,

14:43.884 --> 14:45.250
catch you on the flippity.

14:47.019 --> 14:49.754
Pick up a shirt
while you're at it.

14:50.689 --> 14:52.824
CAROL:
<i>Yeah, so,</i>

14:52.826 --> 14:54.759
that's the wedding scrapbook.

14:54.761 --> 14:57.061
Wish there were
actual pictures.

14:57.063 --> 14:58.763
But... (chuckles)

14:58.765 --> 15:01.266
I like the illustrations.
Thank you.

15:01.268 --> 15:04.168
Yeah, I took a class from
a police sketch artist once.

15:04.170 --> 15:08.206
His drawings led to the capture
of the Green River killer.

15:08.208 --> 15:11.009
Well, it really shows.

15:12.678 --> 15:14.212
Hey, I was wondering,
why don't you and Phil

15:14.214 --> 15:15.780
live in the same house?

15:15.782 --> 15:18.116
He likes to have
a little buffer.

15:18.118 --> 15:20.885
But why? You're his wife.

15:20.887 --> 15:23.187
Well, to be honest,

15:23.189 --> 15:25.924
we only got married
to repopulate.

15:25.926 --> 15:28.059
I didn't want bastard children.

15:28.061 --> 15:30.395
And I got to give him credit.

15:30.397 --> 15:31.930
I mean, he could've walked away.

15:31.932 --> 15:35.099
Most men would probably think
I was crazy for wanting

15:35.101 --> 15:36.434
to be married.

15:36.436 --> 15:38.937
Do you think I'm crazy?

15:38.939 --> 15:40.805
Carol, no.

15:40.807 --> 15:42.774
Do you know how I've spent
the last year of my life?

15:42.776 --> 15:44.375
I've been driving

15:44.377 --> 15:46.878
around the country,
going to different coffee shops.

15:46.880 --> 15:49.547
Just sitting there,
reading old magazines

15:49.549 --> 15:52.283
with my little cup,
and I'd write my name on it

15:52.285 --> 15:54.152
and misspell it.

15:54.154 --> 15:56.621
Just to feel normal.

15:56.623 --> 15:59.557
Well, I'll go have coffee
with you.

15:59.559 --> 16:01.526
I'd like that.

16:03.329 --> 16:05.496
Wh... Is that me?

16:05.498 --> 16:07.298
Yeah.

16:07.300 --> 16:08.933
I just got here yesterday.

16:08.935 --> 16:11.169
Oh, yeah, that's one thing
they teach you in the class.

16:11.171 --> 16:15.073
You have to sketch fast
or the killer could kill again.

16:15.075 --> 16:16.274
Right.

16:16.276 --> 16:17.909
Yeah.

16:17.911 --> 16:19.978
(hammering in distance)

16:24.783 --> 16:25.750
How's it coming?

16:25.752 --> 16:27.185
Oh, hey!

16:27.187 --> 16:29.187
It's going insanely
good. It...

16:29.189 --> 16:31.022
(laughs):
Insanely good.

16:31.024 --> 16:32.590
Yeah, looks like it.

16:32.592 --> 16:34.158
Well, there's an easy fix
for that.

16:34.160 --> 16:36.127
You know, you just
throw a little

16:36.129 --> 16:37.462
nail in there, like so.

16:37.464 --> 16:40.298
(laughs nervously)

16:40.300 --> 16:42.200
I got my thumb there.

16:42.202 --> 16:43.501
Are you okay?

16:43.503 --> 16:45.670
No, I'm good. I'm good.
I'm doing great.

16:45.672 --> 16:48.172
(laughs)
And how are you doing?

16:48.174 --> 16:50.641
I was just wanting to invite
you and Carol over later,

16:50.643 --> 16:52.110
if you're free.

16:52.112 --> 16:53.611
I hooked up my fridge
to a little generator

16:53.613 --> 16:54.946
and have some beers chilling.

16:54.948 --> 16:56.614
(laughs)
Well, that'd be great.

16:56.616 --> 16:58.883
Uh, you know, I'll definitely
pass that on to Carol.

16:59.852 --> 17:02.153
(stifled grunting)

17:02.155 --> 17:04.355
(yells)

17:09.661 --> 17:11.896
It's too bad Carol
couldn't come.

17:11.898 --> 17:14.799
Yeah. Diarrhea.

17:14.801 --> 17:17.301
She takes a lot of chances
in the kitchen.

17:17.303 --> 17:19.804
But, uh, don't mention it
to her, okay?

17:19.806 --> 17:22.607
She gets real embarrassed.

17:24.476 --> 17:27.078
Can I confess something to you?

17:27.080 --> 17:29.080
Yeah, of course.

17:29.082 --> 17:34.018
When I first met you guys,
I liked Carol immediately,

17:34.020 --> 17:36.154
but I was a little...

17:37.423 --> 17:39.624
...unclear on you.

17:40.492 --> 17:42.527
Un-Unclear in what way?

17:42.529 --> 17:46.597
There was a weird...
weird energy at first.

17:46.599 --> 17:48.032
(gasps)
What?

17:48.034 --> 17:49.267
(laughs)

17:49.269 --> 17:51.602
That's, uh, crazy. What?

17:51.604 --> 17:53.004
But then I talked to Carol

17:53.006 --> 17:54.272
and she told me more about
your situation,

17:54.274 --> 17:55.873
and I realized, I might've...

17:55.875 --> 17:58.042
you know, just...

17:58.044 --> 18:00.912
misjudged you, so-so I'm sorry.

18:00.914 --> 18:03.181
Yeah, you misjudged me,
'cause I'm not... (chuckles)

18:03.183 --> 18:05.450
That's weird, you were
unclear on that, but...

18:05.452 --> 18:06.551
I said I was sorry.

18:06.553 --> 18:07.718
No, no, no, no, no, no.

18:07.720 --> 18:09.253
I'm saying
thanks for saying it.

18:09.255 --> 18:12.190
It takes a big person
to be so... to say sorry

18:12.192 --> 18:13.925
and that was...
that's a cool gesture

18:13.927 --> 18:16.194
and, you know, especially
when you're wrong like that.

18:16.196 --> 18:17.562
Um, so...

18:17.564 --> 18:18.930
Hey, cheers to that, though.

18:18.932 --> 18:21.132
I'm so happy
that you misjudged me

18:21.134 --> 18:23.101
and think I'm great.

18:23.103 --> 18:25.169
(chuckles nervously)

18:27.706 --> 18:30.208
Oh, I need to get another beer.
You want another beer?

18:30.210 --> 18:33.244
Well, pretty tipsy already,
but why not?

18:33.246 --> 18:34.612
(laughs)
One more beer.

18:34.614 --> 18:36.547
One more
won't kill me.

18:38.150 --> 18:39.750
(sighs):
God.

18:39.752 --> 18:42.086
Two years.

18:42.088 --> 18:43.554
Such a long time.

18:43.556 --> 18:45.990
Yeah.

18:45.992 --> 18:47.758
I get so lonely, you know.

18:47.760 --> 18:50.061
Yeah?

18:50.063 --> 18:52.964
I guess it's just that I'm--
and I really hate this word,

18:52.966 --> 18:55.633
but there's no other way
to say it-- I'm horny.

18:58.670 --> 19:00.338
I'm so horny, Phil.

19:01.140 --> 19:02.607
Hmm?

19:02.609 --> 19:04.308
I mean, after something
like this happens,

19:04.310 --> 19:06.444
you realize how necessary
it is to be...

19:06.446 --> 19:08.613
you know, just touched

19:08.615 --> 19:11.582
and held and kissed.

19:11.584 --> 19:13.784
I would saw off my right arm
to make out

19:13.786 --> 19:15.153
with a dude.

19:15.155 --> 19:16.787
I would, too. I would, too.
It's natural.

19:16.789 --> 19:19.323
You know, that's why
I'm so happy for you and Carol.

19:19.325 --> 19:20.992
(stammering):
No, but...

19:20.994 --> 19:22.326
I mean, I know that it's not
perfect between you guys,

19:22.328 --> 19:23.761
but at least
you have each other.

19:23.763 --> 19:25.096
Yeah, but, I mean...

19:25.098 --> 19:26.998
And I respect that.

19:27.000 --> 19:29.834
But, God, I just want
to get laid.

19:29.836 --> 19:32.036
(sighs)

19:32.038 --> 19:33.371
Sorry, that was inappropriate.

19:33.373 --> 19:34.839
No, no, no, no.

19:34.841 --> 19:36.474
I shouldn't be talking
to a married man like that.

19:36.476 --> 19:38.676
No, no, no, no, no. Don't beat
yourself up about that.

19:38.678 --> 19:40.811
It's just my luck, the only man
left on the face of the Earth,

19:40.813 --> 19:41.812
and he's married.

19:41.814 --> 19:45.049
He doesn't have to be.

19:45.051 --> 19:47.051
What?

19:47.053 --> 19:48.386
(chuckles nervously)

19:48.388 --> 19:50.621
I got to go have a
quick talk with Carol,

19:50.623 --> 19:52.223
and I will be right back.

19:52.225 --> 19:53.558
(laughs)

19:54.326 --> 19:56.527
Carol!

19:57.296 --> 19:58.729
Coming in!

19:58.731 --> 20:00.264
(grunting)

20:04.536 --> 20:06.003
Carol.
Hi, Phil.

20:06.005 --> 20:07.338
I have something
really important

20:07.340 --> 20:08.739
I need to talk to you about.

20:08.741 --> 20:10.141
Okay, hold on just...
just putting

20:10.143 --> 20:11.709
the finishing touches
on this project.

20:11.711 --> 20:15.046
I really need to talk to you
about this marriage.

20:15.048 --> 20:16.347
And... done.

20:16.349 --> 20:18.015
I think you're really
gonna like it.

20:18.017 --> 20:19.250
It's for my door.

20:19.252 --> 20:20.685
Oh, no.

20:20.687 --> 20:22.987
Home of Carol Pilbasian-Miller.

20:23.822 --> 20:25.523
Look, Phil,

20:25.525 --> 20:30.695
I know it can be an annoying job
at times to fix the door,

20:30.697 --> 20:32.663
but I thought this could help.

20:32.665 --> 20:34.765
It's just a reminder
that I'm rooting for you

20:34.767 --> 20:38.603
and I believe in you,
'cause I'm your wife.

20:38.605 --> 20:41.005
And I know

20:41.007 --> 20:43.341
fixing the door may take time,

20:43.343 --> 20:46.944
but I believe that one day
you will fix it

20:46.946 --> 20:49.914
and that door will be
magnificent.

20:51.583 --> 20:53.584
(sighs)

20:53.586 --> 20:57.088
Um, wh-what did you want
to talk about?

21:00.425 --> 21:03.094
I have diarrhea.

21:04.229 --> 21:06.097
Thank you.

21:06.099 --> 21:08.566
Yup.

21:08.568 --> 21:11.202
Phil, you know the door
symbolizes our marriage.

21:11.204 --> 21:14.071
I know, Carol. I know.
