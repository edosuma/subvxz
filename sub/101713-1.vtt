<i>"Where dips
the rocky highland</i>

01:15.639 --> 01:18.174

01:18.207 --> 01:20.677

02:06.523 --> 02:09.860
<i>I'll never forget
The summer I was eight years old.</i>

02:12.462 --> 02:16.298
<i>It was a summer of tea parties
and sword fights.</i>

02:18.234 --> 02:22.739
<i>Of longing to grow up
and fearing to grow old.</i>

02:22.773 --> 02:25.809
<i>Of wishing things
could stay the same forever.</i>

02:30.346 --> 02:33.315
<i>That was the summer
we found the boat.</i>

02:34.651 --> 02:37.788
I scalp rodent enemy.

02:37.821 --> 02:40.222
I avenge brave chief.

02:40.256 --> 02:42.459
- Let him go.
- Try and make me.

02:43.794 --> 02:45.462
I'll get you!

02:45.495 --> 02:46.897
Tiger Lily, come on.

02:47.998 --> 02:49.533
Wait for me!

03:03.847 --> 03:05.982
I am Pan,
God of the woodlands,

03:06.016 --> 03:07.818
and these are my woods.

03:07.851 --> 03:09.453
You're no Pan.

03:16.392 --> 03:17.928
Take that!

03:17.961 --> 03:20.664
Surrender
the Indian princess now,

03:20.697 --> 03:24.034
or say goodbye to the hostage,
Chief Witchataw.

03:24.067 --> 03:25.602
Never!

03:45.489 --> 03:46.490
Oh!

03:50.427 --> 03:51.393
I'll get it.

03:51.428 --> 03:54.030
Mama said we're not supposed
to go over the wall.

03:54.064 --> 03:57.567
Blimey.
Come and take a look at this.

04:10.346 --> 04:11.948
Who do you think it belongs to?

04:12.916 --> 04:14.451
Finders keepers.

04:15.118 --> 04:16.653
It's ours now.

04:21.525 --> 04:23.994
She just needs
a bit of fixing up.

04:24.027 --> 04:27.363
Just imagine.
The three of us, mateys at sea.

04:27.396 --> 04:30.700
Braving the elements to discover
uncharted territories.

04:35.739 --> 04:37.841
Where to next, Captain?

04:37.874 --> 04:40.577
But, David,
what if we get lost?

04:40.610 --> 04:42.679
Well, that's the whole point,
isn't it?

04:42.712 --> 04:46.817
We'll be the Lost Boys
of the wild. And girls.

04:46.850 --> 04:51.421
Peter, I almost forgot.
I found this in the woods.

04:51.454 --> 04:55.391
Do you reckon it's special?
To the Indians?

04:55.425 --> 04:56.760
It's an eagle feather.

05:01.131 --> 05:02.599
I'd better wash up.

05:44.574 --> 05:48.612
Hurry along, you two.
Did you not see the time?

05:48.645 --> 05:50.914
Oh dear, oh dear.
I shall be too late.

05:50.947 --> 05:54.985
Hush, don't tease him.
He almost lost his scalp today.

05:55.018 --> 05:58.955
Would you ever get a move on?
Go on, get in with you.

05:58.989 --> 06:02.826
Did you forget your Aunt
Eleanor's coming for dinner?

06:02.859 --> 06:04.961
Oh, you'll be the death of me,
the pair of you.

06:04.995 --> 06:06.096
Mmm.

06:07.831 --> 06:09.699
Who are these dirty vagabonds

06:09.733 --> 06:12.669
and what have they done
with my children?

06:12.702 --> 06:15.105
- Where's Peter?
- He went to speak with Father.

06:15.138 --> 06:17.974
Upstairs, both of you.

06:18.008 --> 06:19.876
Yes, but this one I keep.

06:19.910 --> 06:21.444
- Get yourselves cleaned up.
- Come, talk to me.

06:21.478 --> 06:22.846
I have something for you.

06:25.782 --> 06:29.152
The tinker was in this morning,
mending the pots,

06:29.185 --> 06:32.923
and when he was done, he found
he had some extra copper,

06:32.956 --> 06:37.527
and with it he agreed
to fashion you a small present.

06:38.228 --> 06:39.796
Would you like to see it?

06:44.734 --> 06:47.504
- It's just a bell.
- Oh!

06:47.537 --> 06:49.906
She didn't mean it, I promise.

06:51.241 --> 06:52.776
No, no, it's alright.

07:15.165 --> 07:16.967
- Let me guess.
- Oh!

07:17.000 --> 07:19.002
- Peter.
- <i>The Golden Hind?</i>

07:19.736 --> 07:22.272
You gave me a fright.

07:22.305 --> 07:25.976
It's not suppertime
already, is it?

07:26.009 --> 07:29.946
- Is it for old Mr. Brown?
- Right you are.

07:29.980 --> 07:32.215
<i>The Golden Hind.</i>

07:32.248 --> 07:38.722
The first ship to sail
all the way around the globe.

07:38.755 --> 07:43.727
Imagine what it must be like
to see the whole world.

07:43.760 --> 07:47.564
To sail the Indian Ocean
and the Pacific

07:47.597 --> 07:51.735
and maybe even discover
new lands.

07:53.136 --> 07:56.740
Ah... The things
she must have seen.

07:59.609 --> 08:02.212
When the first baby laughed...

08:02.245 --> 08:04.014
...for the first time,

08:04.047 --> 08:08.118
its laugh broke
into a thousand pieces

08:08.151 --> 08:10.954
and they all went
skipping about,

08:12.222 --> 08:17.627
and that was the beginning
of the fairies.

08:17.660 --> 08:22.098
You see, fairies are far
too magical for the human eye.

08:22.132 --> 08:28.071
So when we look at them,
they take the form of bells.

08:28.104 --> 08:32.842
Every child has a fairy
born just for them.

08:34.144 --> 08:36.679
And this...

08:36.713 --> 08:39.082
...tinker's bell
was born for you.

08:47.223 --> 08:51.061
Tinker Bell.
It's wonderful to meet you.

08:58.168 --> 08:59.335
What's this?

09:04.140 --> 09:05.308
"Dear Mr. Littleton,

09:05.341 --> 09:06.943
"it is my duty to inform you

09:06.976 --> 09:09.813
"that your son Peter
is currently failing...

09:11.415 --> 09:13.083
"All his subjects."

09:14.717 --> 09:16.886
- Peter.
- I know what she thinks.

09:16.920 --> 09:19.656
I may not be David,
but I'm not a duffer.

09:19.689 --> 09:23.093
Peter, who said anything
about David?

09:23.126 --> 09:24.961
If you were a duffer,
would you be able to recite

09:24.994 --> 09:26.963
a complete index
of British naval vessels

09:26.996 --> 09:29.199
from the last decade
in under five minutes?

09:29.232 --> 09:31.234
Would you be able to construct

09:31.267 --> 09:35.839
a fully functioning
model galleon in a bottle?

09:35.872 --> 09:37.907
Unlike your siblings,
I might add.

09:38.808 --> 09:40.043
Eh?

09:40.076 --> 09:41.344
I'm not in trouble, then?

09:42.912 --> 09:44.214
Of course you're in trouble.

09:50.186 --> 09:55.358
Look, you've got to try, Peter.

09:57.894 --> 09:59.129
For me?

10:04.134 --> 10:05.402
Come here.

10:38.402 --> 10:40.236
Careful, darling.

10:46.142 --> 10:47.377
Last one.

10:48.845 --> 10:50.313
Beware of the queen of hearts.

10:59.756 --> 11:01.090
Easy does it.

11:04.894 --> 11:06.463
Well done.

11:06.497 --> 11:08.965
- Bravo.
- Bravo. Come on, darling.

11:08.998 --> 11:10.833
Let's keep going.

11:10.867 --> 11:14.804
This silly game has become
something of a family sport.

11:14.837 --> 11:15.972
Our record is four decks,

11:16.005 --> 11:19.242
but Jack thinks
we can do it in five.

11:19.275 --> 11:22.178
You know, I'm...
I'm slightly shocked,

11:22.212 --> 11:25.482
you allow him to have cards
in the house at all.

11:31.387 --> 11:35.124
Red Queen captures White Queen.

11:38.294 --> 11:40.464
- Alice, Jack.
- Coming!

11:40.497 --> 11:43.032
All right, almost done,
almost done.

11:43.066 --> 11:44.200
All right.

11:49.473 --> 11:50.907
There you are.

11:56.012 --> 11:58.781
Mmm. Don't you look handsome.

12:03.353 --> 12:08.958
Not nearly as handsome
as you are beautiful, my queen.

12:22.138 --> 12:23.039
Mmm.

12:23.072 --> 12:26.276
My sis... My sister
is in the other room...

12:26.309 --> 12:27.977
My sister's in the other room.

12:31.114 --> 12:32.882
Rose?

12:39.188 --> 12:41.525
- Oh, yeah.
- She's in rare form tonight.

12:41.558 --> 12:43.159
Uh-oh.

12:53.404 --> 12:57.441
David. What do you think
about dancing lessons?

12:57.474 --> 13:01.210
One must have lessons if one
hopes to ever attend a ball.

13:01.244 --> 13:05.248
I don't think that's quite where
David's interests lie, Eleanor.

13:06.883 --> 13:08.851
Mama, I wanted to ask if you...

13:08.885 --> 13:11.622
Alice.
Speak when you're spoken to.

13:11.655 --> 13:14.390
Really, child.

13:15.325 --> 13:18.928
But if everybody
obeyed that rule

13:18.961 --> 13:22.298
and you only spoke
when you were spoken to,

13:22.332 --> 13:25.134
and the other person
always waited for you to begin,

13:25.168 --> 13:28.338
nobody would ever say anything.

13:28.371 --> 13:30.541
The Red Queen
does not tolerate disobedience.

13:30.574 --> 13:32.241
Off with your head.

13:32.275 --> 13:34.877
Alice, what was it
you wanted to ask?

13:34.911 --> 13:38.114
A pardon
from the White Queen.

13:38.147 --> 13:40.617
I wondered if you might help me
with a sewing project.

13:40.651 --> 13:45.221
Ah, now, good girl. Sewing is
very becoming to a young lady.

13:45.254 --> 13:47.624
I need to mend
my white rabbit's waistcoat.

13:47.658 --> 13:49.092
It was torn this afternoon

13:49.125 --> 13:51.495
when he was taken hostage
by Indian warriors.

13:51.528 --> 13:54.397
Hmm. Poor thing.
Of course I'll help you.

13:55.398 --> 13:56.633
Good heavens, Rose,

13:56.667 --> 13:58.968
the girl's fingernails
are gnawed to the quick,

13:59.001 --> 14:01.304
and what's left of them
is black with dirt.

14:01.337 --> 14:03.607
She was
playing outside, Ellie.

14:03.640 --> 14:06.610
- It's what children do.
- No, it's what boys do.

14:06.643 --> 14:09.680
It's quite a different matter
with girls.

14:09.713 --> 14:13.249
For heaven's sake, this is not
a way to raise a daughter.

14:13.282 --> 14:16.119
Which you would know from your wealth
of experience raising children?

14:23.993 --> 14:25.027
It's brilliant.

14:25.061 --> 14:27.296
Well, children,
I have some very exciting news.

14:27.330 --> 14:28.965
- David has been...
- No...

14:28.998 --> 14:33.670
David has been accepted
to Bristlemoss School.

14:33.704 --> 14:37.206
He starts the new term
in a month's time.

14:37.240 --> 14:38.509
Bristlemoss School?

14:38.542 --> 14:40.209
Does that mean
you're moving away?

14:40.243 --> 14:42.613
Now, children, let's not
get ahead of ourselves.

14:42.646 --> 14:46.015
Your aunt really shouldn't have
told you about this

14:46.048 --> 14:48.084
before discussing it
with your mother and me.

14:48.117 --> 14:51.254
There's quite a few details
yet to iron out.

14:51.287 --> 14:54.357
No, I have discussed it,
with Rose.

14:56.025 --> 14:58.995
I was going to speak to you.
I just haven't had the chance.

15:05.368 --> 15:07.738
William and I
will fund David's tuition.

15:07.771 --> 15:10.106
Everything has been arranged.

15:13.075 --> 15:15.412
You agreed to this?

15:15.446 --> 15:18.582
I don't see why we must
make things harder on ourselves.

15:18.615 --> 15:20.049
Jack.

15:21.317 --> 15:23.921
- Rose, darling, let him go.
- Jack.

15:31.495 --> 15:32.596
Do you know?

15:32.629 --> 15:34.263
Boys who are away from home

15:34.297 --> 15:37.568
still get presents
for their birthday.

15:37.601 --> 15:41.605
My hat, you'll still make it
for me, won't you?

15:42.271 --> 15:43.407
Of course.

15:56.620 --> 15:58.187
It's an eagle feather.

15:59.322 --> 16:01.658
The most sacred
of all Indian symbols.

16:01.692 --> 16:03.727
What does it stand for?

16:03.760 --> 16:06.597
- Courage.
- Courage.

16:06.630 --> 16:11.502
Well, we can all use a little
extra courage now and then.

16:13.336 --> 16:17.273
<i>The Golden Key.</i> Again.

16:17.306 --> 16:18.775
It's my favorite.

16:18.809 --> 16:20.611
Oh, I know.

16:26.683 --> 16:28.752
We need to check
for the monsters.

16:35.324 --> 16:36.793
Found one.

16:40.731 --> 16:43.399
- Good night, my loves.
- Good night.

17:00.684 --> 17:03.085
I don't want you to go away.

17:06.423 --> 17:09.058
How about I leave my shadow behind while I'm gone?

17:10.827 --> 17:13.329
He's sillier than I am,

17:13.362 --> 17:16.098
so you'll have to keep him
out of trouble.

17:16.132 --> 17:17.568
- Deal?
- Yeah.

17:18.200 --> 17:20.571
Not me. Him.

17:22.506 --> 17:23.574
Deal.

17:31.915 --> 17:34.685
Do people really forget
how to dream when they grow up?

17:34.718 --> 17:37.186
Aunt Eleanor certainly has.

17:37.219 --> 17:38.789
But have Mother and Father?

17:39.656 --> 17:40.891
Why not?

17:40.924 --> 17:43.627
I reckon some people
have extra dream dust

17:43.660 --> 17:45.562
that can travel
out of the nursery windows

17:45.596 --> 17:47.864
and be absorbed by grown-ups.

17:47.898 --> 17:51.435
Should we open the window, then?
Just to be sure?

17:52.201 --> 17:53.336
Great idea.

18:32.308 --> 18:34.578
I saw the letter
from your teacher.

18:36.780 --> 18:38.180
You're not to go outside today

18:38.214 --> 18:39.716
until you've finished
your arithmetic.

18:41.485 --> 18:42.619
All right?

18:49.993 --> 18:51.628
- Morning.
- Morning.

18:58.702 --> 19:00.771
- What's that?
- Uh...

19:01.872 --> 19:03.740
List of supplies.

19:03.774 --> 19:07.778
- For old Mr. Brown's replica?
- That's exactly right.

19:07.811 --> 19:09.980
I'm going into London today
to get them.

19:10.013 --> 19:12.281
I might also catch
an old friend.

19:15.018 --> 19:16.486
Will you be long?

19:20.256 --> 19:21.458
No.

19:23.560 --> 19:24.928
Toodle-oo, Peter.

19:40.744 --> 19:44.313
Dishes and arithmetic.
What a dreadful day.

19:47.349 --> 19:49.519
Why are you so good at this?

19:53.657 --> 19:55.224
I can't do this.

19:57.393 --> 19:59.663
No. That was nothing.

20:00.997 --> 20:02.833
Oh, you've won.

20:04.801 --> 20:06.536
Can we go and play
hide-and-seek now?

20:15.545 --> 20:16.947
<i>The bustle of London</i>

20:16.980 --> 20:19.716
<i>held an edge of mystery
in our minds.</i>

20:21.017 --> 20:24.020
<i>We knew our father
had a life before us,</i>

20:24.054 --> 20:26.923
<i>but what that life
had actually been...</i>

20:28.592 --> 20:30.627
<i>We could scarcely imagine.</i>

20:32.462 --> 20:33.864
Have you seen your dad?

20:35.397 --> 20:36.600
No.

20:37.601 --> 20:38.835
The boss?

20:38.869 --> 20:41.303
Uh, I've needed to stay away.

20:41.905 --> 20:43.907
How is he?

20:43.940 --> 20:45.942
He's still the boss, isn't he?

20:47.444 --> 20:51.581
Have you ever thought of coming
by, for old times' sake?

20:53.583 --> 20:55.317
We both know I can't.

20:59.089 --> 21:00.791
How's the rest of your family?

21:00.824 --> 21:04.961
My eldest son will soon be
leaving for Bristlemoss.

21:04.995 --> 21:08.932
Oh. Will you look at that?
You must be proud.

21:10.967 --> 21:13.637
Yeah. Suppose I am.

21:14.938 --> 21:18.742
My own boy, Bristlemoss.

21:18.775 --> 21:20.376
Who'd have thought it, eh?

21:21.945 --> 21:24.781
I should get him something.

21:24.815 --> 21:27.851
The boy deserves a gift
for an accomplishment like that,

21:27.884 --> 21:29.385
doesn't he?

21:33.790 --> 21:35.692
I found you.

21:35.725 --> 21:37.794
You hardly gave me a challenge.

22:04.855 --> 22:07.657
- Let me help.
- I don't need your help.

22:07.691 --> 22:09.159
Mama will let you play
once you're done.

22:09.192 --> 22:10.660
Leave me alone.

22:12.062 --> 22:15.599
You were never planning on repairing
that boat with me, were you?

22:15.632 --> 22:17.133
Of course I was.
I didn't know I'd get...

22:17.167 --> 22:19.402
It doesn't matter.

22:19.436 --> 22:22.005
Go to your stupid school.

22:22.038 --> 22:24.174
You're just like
all the rest of them.

22:24.207 --> 22:26.076
But not me.

22:26.109 --> 22:28.612
No one will catch me
and make me a man.

22:32.048 --> 22:33.416
Hard at work?

22:34.851 --> 22:37.354
Uh, I just wanted to...

22:38.922 --> 22:40.090
David?

22:46.062 --> 22:48.131
For the man of the moment.

22:50.734 --> 22:52.068
Well, open it.

22:55.939 --> 22:57.841
It's just like...

22:57.874 --> 23:00.677
The one my father
gave to me, yes.

23:01.778 --> 23:03.813
You never met your grandfather.

23:03.847 --> 23:05.849
Um, he...

23:06.583 --> 23:09.586
Had high hopes for me.

23:09.619 --> 23:13.089
I'm afraid I never quite fulfilled them.

23:14.224 --> 23:18.461
But I want you to know
I'm proud of you, David.

23:30.607 --> 23:32.809
All right, I'll let you
get back to it.

23:37.814 --> 23:39.849
Give me that.

23:39.883 --> 23:42.652
We'll still have time
for adventures before I leave.

23:42.686 --> 23:44.821
What are you doing?

24:10.814 --> 24:13.717
Pirates.
This could be dangerous.

24:15.919 --> 24:17.887
You can retreat if you want.

24:17.921 --> 24:20.557
Go back if you want,
Bristlemoss boy.

24:21.257 --> 24:22.659
I'm not scared.

24:22.692 --> 24:23.927
Neither am I.

24:26.029 --> 24:28.631
One... Two...

24:29.032 --> 24:30.200
Three.

24:36.906 --> 24:38.641
I know you're here!

24:40.076 --> 24:41.711
Come out and fight!

24:42.579 --> 24:43.713
Come here!

24:43.747 --> 24:45.849
I'll fight all the pirates
in the sea.

24:50.887 --> 24:51.888
Yah!

24:53.189 --> 24:54.758
Behind you!

25:03.299 --> 25:04.667
Up above!

25:07.337 --> 25:08.905
Well done, David!

25:09.973 --> 25:13.610
Yay!

25:13.643 --> 25:15.311
Whoo!

25:32.362 --> 25:33.997
David!

25:54.050 --> 25:55.251
Argh!

27:21.938 --> 27:23.806
I miss David.

27:40.957 --> 27:42.959
- Did you see that?
- What?

27:43.326 --> 27:44.994
That's it.

27:45.028 --> 27:48.231
We were playing hide-and-seek
and now he wants me to find him.

27:48.264 --> 27:49.433
Alice.

27:51.367 --> 27:52.835
He's gone.

27:54.070 --> 27:56.039
He's gone,
and it's because of me.

27:56.072 --> 27:57.740
Peter, please.

28:52.395 --> 28:54.565
<i>You can retreat
if you want.</i>

28:54.598 --> 28:57.400
<i>Go back if you want,
Bristlemoss boy.</i>

29:03.574 --> 29:05.275
No, Alice.

29:10.947 --> 29:12.215
Mama?

29:12.949 --> 29:14.250
Go and play.

29:18.955 --> 29:21.090
What are you doing?

29:21.124 --> 29:24.461
Making a hat for David,
as I promised.

29:30.199 --> 29:31.834
Did you hear that, Tink?

29:31.868 --> 29:35.572
She's making him a hat.
He will come back.

29:39.175 --> 29:40.843
There we are.

29:40.877 --> 29:43.012
Why isn't Mama tucking us in?

29:43.447 --> 29:45.582
I want Mama.

29:45.616 --> 29:47.418
Your mother needs her rest.

29:56.259 --> 29:59.195
Come on, then.
Let's read a story.

29:59.228 --> 30:03.066
Goody! Tell us the story
about the orphanage.

30:04.501 --> 30:05.935
Let's see.

30:07.404 --> 30:09.972
I think this is the right one.

30:12.208 --> 30:14.277
"Long ago,

30:14.310 --> 30:17.280
<i>"in a faraway land,</i>

30:17.313 --> 30:20.316
<i>"there was an orphanage.</i>

30:20.350 --> 30:23.620
<i>"By day, the children did
as they were told.</i>

30:24.588 --> 30:26.856
<i>"They studied hard.</i>

30:27.957 --> 30:30.494
<i>"They worked hard.</i>

30:32.496 --> 30:37.266
<i>"And they never, ever
played games.</i>

30:41.705 --> 30:43.407
<i>"But at night,</i>

30:44.941 --> 30:47.176
<i>"when they were left alone,</i>

30:47.210 --> 30:52.181
<i>"their golden dream dust
would fill the room</i>

30:52.215 --> 30:55.985
<i>"and take them far, far away,</i>

30:57.019 --> 30:58.555
<i>"and no matter how he tried,</i>

30:58.589 --> 31:00.557
<i>"their keeper
couldn't stop them</i>

31:00.591 --> 31:04.360
<i>"from escaping
into their dreams."</i>

31:04.394 --> 31:06.463
<i>'Cause being a grown-up,</i>

31:06.497 --> 31:09.232
<i>he had forgotten
how to dream long ago.</i>

31:12.403 --> 31:15.938
Peter, whatever's the matter
with you?

31:15.972 --> 31:20.343
I think I'm getting too old
for bedtime stories, that's all.

31:21.177 --> 31:22.378
Good night.

31:24.548 --> 31:26.282
Off to bed.

31:51.007 --> 31:52.108
Peter.

32:20.069 --> 32:22.606
<i>I don't want you
to go away.</i>

32:44.193 --> 32:46.730
<i>No one will catch me
and make me a man.</i>

33:30.172 --> 33:32.576
<i>We'll be
the Lost Boys of the wild.</i>

33:39.382 --> 33:41.250
Catch us if you can!

33:44.287 --> 33:45.822
Wait for me!

33:47.624 --> 33:51.394
You'll never catch us!
We're the Lost Boys of the wild!

33:52.529 --> 33:54.196
Wait!

34:05.676 --> 34:07.109
Hello?

34:09.312 --> 34:10.814
Hello?

34:16.887 --> 34:18.455
Rose?

34:25.729 --> 34:27.196
Mmm.

34:33.437 --> 34:34.738
Rose?

35:26.355 --> 35:27.591
Charlie.

35:28.692 --> 35:31.461
Oh, Jack,
I'm sorry about your son.

35:31.495 --> 35:32.696
Deal me in.

35:36.867 --> 35:38.468
I said deal me in.

35:41.638 --> 35:42.873
Give me your cards.

35:44.541 --> 35:45.776
You too.

36:18.442 --> 36:22.311
Well, you certainly
seem to be enjoying yourself.

36:24.648 --> 36:26.850
What makes you think
you can come in here

36:26.883 --> 36:28.885
and play these tables, hmm?

36:28.919 --> 36:30.721
My debts were cleared away
years ago.

36:30.754 --> 36:31.955
Is that so?

36:33.457 --> 36:35.826
Just had a bad run,
fellas.

36:35.859 --> 36:38.360
My luck is bound to turn
in good time.

36:39.930 --> 36:43.433
Look, all right.

36:43.467 --> 36:47.604
Give this to that boss of yours.

36:51.875 --> 36:54.444
Tell him he knows
I'm good for it, all right?

36:58.849 --> 37:00.851
I'm sure he's gonna love this.

37:04.921 --> 37:06.223
Rose?

37:07.924 --> 37:10.494
Rose?

37:10.527 --> 37:12.996
Rose,
haven't you heard a word I've said?

37:19.335 --> 37:20.537
Actually...

37:23.473 --> 37:26.810
I'd like you to come and stay
with William and me for a while.

37:26.843 --> 37:28.945
Why are you doing this
to yourself?

37:28.979 --> 37:31.014
I just don't understand.

37:33.650 --> 37:36.318
Until you're a mother,
you never will.

37:38.855 --> 37:40.023
I see.

37:43.560 --> 37:44.828
Never mind.

37:46.129 --> 37:48.598
<i>My mother seemed to be lost.</i>

37:50.834 --> 37:52.769
<i>I couldn't reach her.</i>

37:54.738 --> 37:57.607
<i>So I reached for a heart
I could touch instead.</i>

37:57.641 --> 37:59.676
Would you like some tea?

38:02.445 --> 38:05.081
We would be ever so grateful
for the company.

38:11.855 --> 38:13.089
Thank you.

38:22.899 --> 38:24.768
Oh. Uh.

38:54.097 --> 38:56.666
Would you like to see
a real teahouse?

39:18.788 --> 39:21.591
Mmm.
Thank you so much.

39:40.543 --> 39:41.978
Are you enjoying yourself?

39:44.514 --> 39:45.782
Ah, you have a...

39:47.617 --> 39:49.753
Yes, a little bit
of cream just...

39:51.154 --> 39:52.889
A little bit lower.

39:56.860 --> 39:58.662
Almost gone.

40:00.630 --> 40:02.432
Ah! Isn't this nice?

40:04.134 --> 40:07.904
It's a shame we haven't spent
much time together before.

40:07.938 --> 40:10.607
You really are a lovely girl.

40:10.640 --> 40:13.076
I'm not a girl. I'm a lady.

40:13.109 --> 40:15.512
Then I think you should know,

40:15.545 --> 40:18.915
a lady never rests her elbows
on the table.

40:23.153 --> 40:28.458
A lady also only crosses
her legs at the ankles.

40:33.196 --> 40:34.931
Oh, you poor thing.

40:34.965 --> 40:37.801
You just want to be brought up
in a civilized manner.

40:37.834 --> 40:39.235
Is that not so?

40:41.104 --> 40:45.141
You need my help, and my help
is what you're going to get.

40:45.175 --> 40:48.611
A lady should never gnaw
on her fingernails.

40:48.645 --> 40:51.848
It is a disgusting habit
of the lower class.

40:51.881 --> 40:56.152
And just because your father
is from that class,

40:56.186 --> 40:59.823
it does not mean
that you have to be too.

40:59.856 --> 41:02.258
We will make a lady of you yet.

41:10.600 --> 41:12.135
It's perfect.

41:13.737 --> 41:15.939
It was the last thing
I promised him.

41:17.107 --> 41:18.241
I know.

41:28.051 --> 41:29.586
I have news.

41:38.762 --> 41:42.165
Peter, that is wonderful.

41:42.198 --> 41:43.566
Oh, my.

41:43.600 --> 41:45.235
I want to take David's place,

41:46.736 --> 41:48.038
at Bristlemoss.

41:48.938 --> 41:50.840
I can make you proud too.

41:51.941 --> 41:55.578
Peter, you've always
made us proud.

42:00.216 --> 42:01.851
- Stay back.
- No, no, no.

42:01.885 --> 42:04.154
I told you
to pay your debt, Littleton!

42:07.323 --> 42:08.825
Everyone all right?

42:22.338 --> 42:24.707
Rose, I can explain.

42:24.741 --> 42:26.209
We need to send for the police.

42:26.242 --> 42:28.845
No, no. He's got the police
in his pocket.

42:28.878 --> 42:31.881
Why? Why?
After all these years?

42:31.915 --> 42:34.851
- You know what he's like.
- I'll pay it off.

42:34.884 --> 42:37.220
Once I finish <i>The Golden Hind</i>
for Mr. Brown,

42:37.253 --> 42:39.956
we'll have enough
to pay off my debt.

42:39.989 --> 42:41.958
- Rose...
- Finish it, then.

42:41.991 --> 42:44.194
- Rose. Rose.
- Finish it. Hannah.

42:46.329 --> 42:47.964
Children.

43:02.045 --> 43:03.346
What are you doing?

43:08.084 --> 43:09.786
Alice, go back to sleep.

43:11.287 --> 43:12.789
Peter.

43:21.264 --> 43:24.167
What happened tonight,
the trouble Father's in,

43:25.802 --> 43:28.304
it never would have happened
if David were here.

43:30.240 --> 43:33.676
And if it had, he wouldn't have
stood by and watched.

43:37.113 --> 43:38.281
Wait.

43:40.283 --> 43:41.951
I want to help.

44:17.020 --> 44:19.022
Alice, get down.

44:37.307 --> 44:39.342
Evening, sweetheart.

44:39.375 --> 44:41.244
Can you spare any pennies?

44:42.145 --> 44:44.481
Oh, I've had enough
of this.

44:44.515 --> 44:46.249
I'm going for an ale.

44:51.488 --> 44:54.958
Oh, no, no, no.
I don't take any myself.

45:04.300 --> 45:06.302
- Oi! Watch it!
- Go, go, go!

45:06.336 --> 45:09.806
- Oi!
- Oi!

45:09.839 --> 45:12.175
- Out of the way!
- Hurry up! He's coming!

45:13.109 --> 45:14.944
Hurry up! Come on!

45:17.847 --> 45:21.150
Get back here!
You dirty little vermin!

45:21.184 --> 45:23.853
- Run! Go!
- Move, you sop!

45:25.288 --> 45:28.091
Wait till I get my hands on you,
you rats!

45:31.027 --> 45:33.296
Hurry up!
Get out of the way!

45:33.329 --> 45:35.832
D'you hear me?
You little scum!

45:43.607 --> 45:45.208
Alice, go!

45:46.042 --> 45:47.877
You little toerag!

45:58.221 --> 46:02.392
If I get my hands on you...
I'm gonna kill you!

46:06.996 --> 46:08.532
Why are you following us?

46:08.565 --> 46:10.534
'Cause of you we lost the loot.

46:10.567 --> 46:11.934
You mean this?

46:18.274 --> 46:21.244
Would you happen to know the way
to the pawn shop?

46:35.391 --> 46:37.528
This is where we leave you.

46:37.561 --> 46:39.028
You're not coming?

46:39.062 --> 46:40.464
We've got business at the Row.

46:49.906 --> 46:51.442
How can we repay you?

47:03.654 --> 47:05.121
Hello?

47:39.021 --> 47:40.289
Is anyone there?

47:40.323 --> 47:42.358
Children, children!

47:42.392 --> 47:46.195
Games and games,
and what are your names, hmm?

47:46.229 --> 47:48.297
- Peter.
- Peter...

47:48.331 --> 47:49.966
- Little...
- Pan.

47:50.967 --> 47:54.137
Peter Pan and Tiger Lily.

47:54.170 --> 47:57.106
Can you answer me a riddle?

47:57.140 --> 47:59.443
- I love riddles.
- She loves riddles.

48:00.243 --> 48:04.113
How is a raven like...

48:05.114 --> 48:07.451
A writing desk? Hmm?

48:07.484 --> 48:09.686
How is a raven
like a writing desk?

48:09.720 --> 48:11.655
How much will you give me
for this?

48:22.599 --> 48:25.636
Must you sell it?

48:29.205 --> 48:33.042
Hmm! Let us all move
one pace on.

49:02.271 --> 49:03.407
Thank you.

49:22.124 --> 49:23.993
Alice, look.

50:37.568 --> 50:39.368
What do you have for me?

51:02.492 --> 51:04.260
Have you guessed
the riddle yet?

51:04.293 --> 51:06.597
No. What's the answer?

51:06.630 --> 51:09.098
I haven't
the slightest idea.

51:09.700 --> 51:11.367
Ooh. May I?

51:11.400 --> 51:14.404
Your hair wants cutting.

51:14.438 --> 51:15.539
Father!

51:21.645 --> 51:23.547
We've got guests.

51:23.580 --> 51:27.383
Customers, yes, yes, we know.

51:28.585 --> 51:31.320
What are your names, then?

51:31.354 --> 51:33.890
- Peter Pan.
- I'm Tiger Lily.

51:34.591 --> 51:35.726
Indeed.

51:39.863 --> 51:41.465
And you can call me...

51:43.867 --> 51:44.868
CJ.

51:53.710 --> 51:56.178
It's quite
an extraordinary piece.

51:57.781 --> 51:59.716
And the inscription is...

52:01.317 --> 52:02.351
Somewhat...

52:05.354 --> 52:06.690
Personal.

52:06.723 --> 52:09.158
It was a gift from our father.

52:11.995 --> 52:13.697
Complicated, aren't they?

52:19.536 --> 52:21.203
Fathers.

52:27.678 --> 52:29.746
Are you sure you're
willing to part with him?

52:30.981 --> 52:32.181
What?

52:37.587 --> 52:42.258
I said are you sure you're
willing to part with it?

52:42.291 --> 52:43.694
We need to sell it.

52:55.539 --> 52:56.840
Well, then,

53:00.677 --> 53:02.311
let's do business.

53:09.920 --> 53:12.756
We did it. We really did it.

53:14.591 --> 53:17.494
I can't wait to see Papa's face
in the morning.

54:35.438 --> 54:37.073
<i>I've often
wondered when it was</i>

54:37.107 --> 54:40.677
<i>that my brother and I
were set on different paths.</i>

54:43.880 --> 54:46.449
<i>We were wounded
by the same hurts.</i>

54:48.451 --> 54:50.352
Alice, wake up.

54:52.989 --> 54:55.559
<i>Soothed by the same lullabies.</i>

54:58.495 --> 55:01.464
<i>Was there a single moment
when we diverged?</i>

55:27.190 --> 55:29.059
You're standing
on my foot!

55:39.703 --> 55:43.372
The Lost Boys at your service.
We want you to come with us.

56:08.531 --> 56:09.900
Where did you get this?

57:10.660 --> 57:13.063
Alice, what are you doing?

57:14.064 --> 57:16.633
I told you always to knock.

57:16.666 --> 57:18.034
I'm sorry, Mama.

57:19.736 --> 57:21.471
What does your potion do?

57:22.572 --> 57:26.576
Never you mind.
This is not for children.

57:26.609 --> 57:29.245
It is not ever for children.

57:29.279 --> 57:32.749
I'm not a child.
I'm a young lady.

57:32.782 --> 57:35.952
I know all about
how a lady acts.

57:35.986 --> 57:39.923
For instance, nail biting
is unacceptable for a lady.

57:39.956 --> 57:42.625
It's a disgusting habit
of the lower class.

57:42.659 --> 57:43.626
The lower class?

57:43.660 --> 57:46.096
Just because Father
is of that class does not...

57:47.998 --> 57:51.134
Don't you ever speak
of your father that way. Ever!

57:54.704 --> 57:55.939
Go to your room.

58:11.087 --> 58:13.690
<i>Take me away from here,
Tinker Bell.</i>

58:15.225 --> 58:17.660
I know you're a real fairy.

58:17.694 --> 58:19.729
You can show yourself to me.

58:20.130 --> 58:21.631
It's safe.

58:33.009 --> 58:34.878
<i>Tink, please.</i>

58:47.791 --> 58:48.958
Tink?

58:57.967 --> 58:59.836
I'm so sorry, Tink.

59:01.771 --> 59:03.239
<i>Mr. Littleton, sir.</i>

59:03.273 --> 59:05.108
Oh, thank you, Wells.

59:06.376 --> 59:09.779
Jack, good to see you.

59:09.813 --> 59:11.681
Mr. Brown.

59:11.714 --> 59:17.353
Uh, please, can I interest you
in some mock turtle soup?

59:17.387 --> 59:19.222
Oh, no. No, thank you, sir.

59:19.255 --> 59:21.291
No. Wise man.

59:22.358 --> 59:24.928
What can I do for you?

59:24.961 --> 59:27.363
Well, I know it took longer
than we discussed,

59:27.397 --> 59:32.268
but the replica you commissioned
has been completed, sir.

59:35.772 --> 59:39.809
Oh, that is exquisite.

59:39.843 --> 59:43.079
Your work never ceases
to impress, Jack.

59:43.113 --> 59:46.149
But this particular replica

59:46.182 --> 59:49.819
was meant as a birthday gift
for my grandson.

59:50.454 --> 59:51.988
Shall I inscribe it, sir?

59:52.021 --> 59:56.025
His birthday
was over a week ago.

59:56.059 --> 59:59.395
I heard word of what happened
to your son. I'm so sorry.

59:59.430 --> 1:00:04.234
I sent Wells to inquire,
but you were never at home.

1:00:04.267 --> 1:00:08.037
You see, I had no choice
but to hire...

1:00:09.139 --> 1:00:11.674
Another craftsman
to do the job.

1:00:13.477 --> 1:00:16.045
I'm sure you can understand.

1:00:24.220 --> 1:00:25.321
Yes.

1:00:28.291 --> 1:00:30.960
Yes, of course.

1:00:33.830 --> 1:00:35.832
Thank you, sir.

1:00:51.482 --> 1:00:52.782
Yes?

1:01:10.833 --> 1:01:14.003
I'm sorry for what I said.

1:01:36.259 --> 1:01:37.794
I slapped Alice.

1:01:39.862 --> 1:01:41.397
Rose, how could you?

1:01:41.432 --> 1:01:44.300
The way she looked at me, Ellie.

1:01:48.838 --> 1:01:51.040
I just haven't
been myself since...

1:01:54.445 --> 1:01:55.512
I just...

1:01:55.546 --> 1:01:58.482
I just wanted to hold onto him,
just a little longer.

1:02:03.152 --> 1:02:09.526
Now there's everything
with Jack.

1:02:09.560 --> 1:02:12.895
What about Jack?
What's happened?

1:02:15.064 --> 1:02:17.501
Noth...
I shouldn't have mentioned...

1:02:18.602 --> 1:02:20.803
I just...

1:02:20.837 --> 1:02:23.574
For God's sake, Rose,
stop biting your nails.

1:02:23.607 --> 1:02:25.842
I haven't seen you bite your
nails since you were a girl.

1:02:25.875 --> 1:02:27.478
It's the most disgusting
habit of the lower class

1:02:27.511 --> 1:02:28.878
and you know that.

1:02:32.015 --> 1:02:34.884
And just because Jack
is of that class,

1:02:34.917 --> 1:02:36.853
it doesn't mean we have to be.

1:02:38.855 --> 1:02:41.391
Is that what you said
to my daughter?

1:02:43.893 --> 1:02:45.828
He's her father, Ellie.

1:02:45.862 --> 1:02:48.565
Rose, listen to me,
you have to understand...

1:02:48.599 --> 1:02:49.899
Rose.

1:03:19.463 --> 1:03:21.598
I knew he'd leave me a clue.

1:03:46.089 --> 1:03:48.625
All children have been
to Neverland.

1:03:48.659 --> 1:03:51.327
But most of them
lose their Neverlands forever

1:03:51.361 --> 1:03:54.631
when they get all...
All growed up.

1:03:54.665 --> 1:03:57.434
Their heads get filled
with all kinds of muck.

1:03:57.468 --> 1:03:58.968
Like neckties.

1:03:59.570 --> 1:04:02.105
And taxidermies.

1:04:02.138 --> 1:04:05.341
- Most children?
- Most, but not all.

1:04:05.375 --> 1:04:07.578
Have you ever heard
of dream dust?

1:04:07.611 --> 1:04:09.145
<i>Dream dust?</i>

1:04:28.030 --> 1:04:32.669
<i>Dream dust is the stuff
that makes us remember.</i>

1:04:32.703 --> 1:04:35.938
<i>It's the reason you can
build sandcastles in the sky.</i>

1:04:49.385 --> 1:04:52.456
<i>Or take a voyage
to the moon.</i>

1:04:52.489 --> 1:04:54.123
<i>All right.</i>

1:04:54.157 --> 1:04:56.392
But what does that
have to do with me?

1:04:56.427 --> 1:05:00.431
You have more dream dust
than anyone we've ever seen.

1:05:01.498 --> 1:05:03.734
You never have to grow up.

1:05:03.767 --> 1:05:07.003
Come to Neverland with us, Pan,
and be a boy forever.

1:05:07.036 --> 1:05:08.971
I have to grow up, Nibs.

1:05:10.206 --> 1:05:15.044
My family, all their
expectations lie in me now.

1:05:15.077 --> 1:05:19.182
Don't you see? It isn't
their expectations inside you.

1:05:19.215 --> 1:05:20.651
It's their dreams.

1:06:27.149 --> 1:06:28.785
<i>What does your potion do?</i>

1:06:35.859 --> 1:06:39.530
Please, potion,
take me away from here.

1:06:40.329 --> 1:06:41.732
Make me disappear.

1:07:24.206 --> 1:07:25.274
Papa?

1:07:45.796 --> 1:07:47.564
Here.

1:07:47.598 --> 1:07:50.467
You can use it
to pay off those men.

1:07:55.171 --> 1:07:56.707
How did you get this?

1:08:00.209 --> 1:08:02.479
This is not your burden to bear.

1:08:02.512 --> 1:08:05.281
Peter, you're...
You're not to worry.

1:08:05.314 --> 1:08:08.752
Don't you understand?
Everything's all right now.

1:08:10.887 --> 1:08:13.757
That's what you needed,
and I got it for you.

1:08:17.761 --> 1:08:19.463
Where did you get this?

1:08:20.530 --> 1:08:22.264
No.

1:08:26.470 --> 1:08:29.773
Where did you get this?
Answer me!

1:08:31.808 --> 1:08:32.809
Peter.

1:08:34.210 --> 1:08:35.378
Peter.

1:08:45.622 --> 1:08:46.790
Peter!

1:08:48.625 --> 1:08:49.793
Peter?

1:08:51.628 --> 1:08:53.597
Let me take care of this.

1:08:55.465 --> 1:08:57.434
This is my problem,
not yours.

1:08:59.002 --> 1:09:00.403
Peter.

1:09:04.775 --> 1:09:05.942
Peter.

1:09:08.979 --> 1:09:10.346
Peter?

1:09:20.791 --> 1:09:22.693
If you're here, come out.

1:09:26.328 --> 1:09:28.330
I want to come with you.

1:09:28.364 --> 1:09:32.502
<i>The bond between
my brothers was deep and true.</i>

1:09:36.506 --> 1:09:38.975
<i>But not all brothers
are as lucky,</i>

1:09:40.844 --> 1:09:43.714
<i>and when fathers
divide their sons...</i>

1:09:44.448 --> 1:09:45.849
Hello, Father.

1:09:45.882 --> 1:09:48.552
<i>...it can
all go terribly wrong.</i>

1:09:48.585 --> 1:09:49.619
My boy!

1:09:52.856 --> 1:09:54.424
Oh!

1:09:54.458 --> 1:09:56.560
James, look here.

1:09:58.662 --> 1:10:02.364
This is my son Jack,

1:10:02.398 --> 1:10:04.534
home from university.

1:10:05.469 --> 1:10:07.537
Tell Margaret to come down...

1:10:08.605 --> 1:10:10.306
And put the kettle on.

1:10:10.339 --> 1:10:11.942
- Come, come, come.
- I'm alright. I'm alright.

1:10:11.975 --> 1:10:14.310
Sit. Sit.

1:10:14.343 --> 1:10:17.246
- He's a bit slow.
- Enough!

1:10:21.084 --> 1:10:23.285
I don't have the money, James.

1:10:25.422 --> 1:10:26.656
I need more time.

1:10:28.625 --> 1:10:31.661
After 12 years,
that's all you have to say?

1:10:34.731 --> 1:10:37.601
Have a drink
with your brother, Jack.

1:10:37.634 --> 1:10:39.401
We'll discuss business later.

1:10:42.472 --> 1:10:43.673
Bottoms up.

1:10:50.514 --> 1:10:54.383
Your leftover brats,
they're wilier than I expected,

1:10:54.417 --> 1:10:56.486
for two pampered little toffs.

1:10:57.921 --> 1:11:01.357
They showed up.
Can you imagine?

1:11:01.390 --> 1:11:06.429
Two little mice traipsing
into the mouth of a crocodile.

1:11:06.463 --> 1:11:08.364
And you were gentle with 'em.

1:11:09.365 --> 1:11:10.467
I appreciate that.

1:11:10.500 --> 1:11:12.569
They're my flesh and blood,
Jack.

1:11:12.602 --> 1:11:15.739
Not all of us
betray our families.

1:11:15.772 --> 1:11:20.309
Plus, they came
bearing treasures

1:11:21.411 --> 1:11:22.679
from a long forgotten past.

1:11:23.547 --> 1:11:24.815
"To our son, with pride."

1:11:27.050 --> 1:11:28.652
Touching as ever.

1:11:30.587 --> 1:11:33.790
So, right back where we began.

1:11:37.527 --> 1:11:39.696
I was a lost man, Father.

1:11:40.664 --> 1:11:43.767
I had to get away. I had to.

1:11:43.800 --> 1:11:46.603
And yet
here you are again.

1:11:46.636 --> 1:11:49.338
Perhaps this is where
you always belonged.

1:11:51.942 --> 1:11:53.543
I'm nothing like you.

1:11:54.811 --> 1:11:56.980
Father.

1:11:59.883 --> 1:12:01.618
Go lay down, Father.

1:12:02.953 --> 1:12:05.555
Yes. I'll go lay down.

1:12:13.029 --> 1:12:17.167
I'll get you
the money soon, all right?

1:12:17.200 --> 1:12:19.401
The rules never really
did apply to you,

1:12:19.436 --> 1:12:21.805
- did they, little Jack?
- I just need some more time.

1:12:21.838 --> 1:12:23.907
Always an arrogant
little snob.

1:12:23.940 --> 1:12:28.478
I lost my son, James.
I lost my son.

1:12:28.511 --> 1:12:29.713
Please.

1:12:32.949 --> 1:12:34.117
Please.

1:12:35.652 --> 1:12:37.420
I'm still your brother.

1:12:41.124 --> 1:12:43.960
Well, then, brother...

1:12:47.230 --> 1:12:49.099
For once in your life,

1:12:51.801 --> 1:12:53.603
you shall pay your debt.

1:13:04.514 --> 1:13:05.715
<i>Rose!</i>

1:13:07.484 --> 1:13:09.419
He crushed my hand.

1:13:13.256 --> 1:13:16.026
All I did was
ask for more time.

1:13:19.529 --> 1:13:20.830
I'll kill him.

1:13:22.098 --> 1:13:23.566
I'll kill him.

1:13:25.669 --> 1:13:28.538
Off with his head.

1:13:28.571 --> 1:13:32.575
<i>Don't you ever speak
of your father that way, ever!</i>

1:13:34.177 --> 1:13:35.512
Darling?

1:13:37.180 --> 1:13:38.581
Alice?

1:13:39.749 --> 1:13:40.850
Leave me alone.

1:13:42.018 --> 1:13:43.954
We need
to get a doctor.

1:13:43.987 --> 1:13:45.722
I'll get the doctor.

1:13:49.025 --> 1:13:50.060
Peter.

1:13:51.661 --> 1:13:54.030
We've always been alike.

1:13:54.064 --> 1:13:57.534
A little bit lighter
than the world will allow.

1:13:57.567 --> 1:13:59.736
Don't let life drag you down.

1:14:01.638 --> 1:14:06.009
You just keep floating above it,
long as you can.

1:14:06.042 --> 1:14:07.243
You promise?

1:14:08.745 --> 1:14:12.615
Peter... You promise?

1:14:17.120 --> 1:14:18.588
I promise.

1:14:31.968 --> 1:14:33.770
She's upstairs.

1:14:42.946 --> 1:14:44.280
Leave me alone.

1:14:46.716 --> 1:14:48.651
My mother's not in here.

1:14:49.586 --> 1:14:51.254
I didn't come for your mother.

1:14:52.622 --> 1:14:53.923
I came for you.

1:14:55.358 --> 1:14:56.693
Look.

1:15:11.341 --> 1:15:12.776
Rose, darling, how's Jack?

1:15:12.809 --> 1:15:15.779
They took
his hand, Eleanor.

1:15:16.679 --> 1:15:18.648
He's a craftsman.
He can't work.

1:15:18.681 --> 1:15:20.750
I want you to know
that William and I

1:15:20.784 --> 1:15:23.053
will do anything we can
to help you

1:15:23.086 --> 1:15:25.722
until Jack
is back on his feet again.

1:15:26.189 --> 1:15:27.724
Under one condition.

1:15:28.792 --> 1:15:31.227
Alice comes with me.

1:15:35.865 --> 1:15:37.067
Get out.

1:15:37.100 --> 1:15:38.935
I'll raise her properly, Rose,

1:15:38.968 --> 1:15:42.872
see that she's well-groomed
and well married.

1:15:42.906 --> 1:15:44.674
Leave my house.

1:15:46.843 --> 1:15:48.244
Even if I do,

1:15:49.779 --> 1:15:52.715
I can't promise
that she'll stay away from me.

1:15:52.749 --> 1:15:55.885
You see, darling,
it was Alice that suggested it.

1:15:59.856 --> 1:16:00.957
Leave.

1:16:02.659 --> 1:16:04.961
- Get out, Eleanor.
- Rose.

1:16:04.994 --> 1:16:06.296
Get out.

1:16:07.697 --> 1:16:09.799
It's for the best.

1:16:09.833 --> 1:16:12.035
You will see
it's for the best.

1:16:22.345 --> 1:16:24.247
What's that?

1:16:30.687 --> 1:16:33.790
I thought you might like
to have your things up here.

1:16:37.428 --> 1:16:38.895
Here, let me help.

1:16:38.928 --> 1:16:41.064
No, no, no. Peter.

1:16:49.939 --> 1:16:51.174
It's over now.

1:16:52.208 --> 1:16:54.978
No one
is going to bother us now.

1:16:55.011 --> 1:16:56.980
Not my brother, not anyone.

1:16:59.315 --> 1:17:00.350
It's over.

1:17:01.751 --> 1:17:02.919
It's over.

1:17:16.799 --> 1:17:18.935
CJ did that to Father, Alice.

1:17:18.968 --> 1:17:20.770
- He's our uncle.
- What?

1:17:20.803 --> 1:17:22.705
CJ's our uncle.

1:17:23.973 --> 1:17:26.075
Our own family did this to us.

1:17:26.109 --> 1:17:27.810
Let go of me.

1:17:29.179 --> 1:17:30.947
He's going to pay,

1:17:32.015 --> 1:17:33.883
and I know how, too.

1:17:37.220 --> 1:17:39.423
No, Peter, you can't.

1:17:39.456 --> 1:17:41.791
They'll come after you.

1:17:41.824 --> 1:17:46.296
Which is why I won't be able
to come back. Not ever.

1:17:48.031 --> 1:17:49.699
Come with me.

1:18:00.143 --> 1:18:02.011
I'm going to live
with Aunt Eleanor.

1:18:02.045 --> 1:18:03.313
Aunt Eleanor?

1:18:04.814 --> 1:18:07.150
She'll turn you into a lady.

1:18:07.183 --> 1:18:10.353
You won't be able to play
or make up stories.

1:18:10.386 --> 1:18:12.855
It's time for me to grow up.

1:18:19.463 --> 1:18:25.068
And this tinker's bell
was born for you.

1:19:24.994 --> 1:19:27.830
<i>The Red Queen does not
tolerate disobedience.</i>

1:19:27.864 --> 1:19:29.332
<i>Off with your head.</i>

1:19:30.567 --> 1:19:33.537
<i>We will make a lady
of you yet.</i>

1:19:38.941 --> 1:19:40.009
Alice!

1:19:46.650 --> 1:19:48.985
It's not time to grow up, Alice.

1:19:51.455 --> 1:19:53.156
It never is.

1:19:55.024 --> 1:19:56.427
Peter?

1:19:57.428 --> 1:19:58.895
You'll see.

1:20:12.975 --> 1:20:15.011
<i>I shall be too late.</i>

1:20:32.929 --> 1:20:36.265
<i>Long ago, in a faraway land,</i>

1:20:38.569 --> 1:20:40.437
<i>there was a family.</i>

1:20:42.271 --> 1:20:45.409
<i>By day, the children did
as they were told,</i>

1:20:50.681 --> 1:20:54.618
<i>and in the innermost places
of their hearts,</i>

1:20:54.651 --> 1:20:58.087
<i>they worried about
what it might mean to grow up.</i>

1:21:14.270 --> 1:21:19.275
<i>But at night, when their
hearts lay still and sleeping,</i>

1:21:21.310 --> 1:21:24.448
<i>their golden dream dust
filled the room</i>

1:21:25.416 --> 1:21:28.985
<i>and took them far, far away.</i>

1:22:02.486 --> 1:22:04.020
Come home.

1:22:30.481 --> 1:22:32.649
Catch me if you can.

1:24:04.140 --> 1:24:07.276
<i>I was
only a visitor in Wonderland.</i>

1:24:09.913 --> 1:24:12.482
<i>Take care of Peter, Tink.</i>

1:24:14.183 --> 1:24:17.554
<i>But Peter
was born to be Pan.</i>

1:24:29.633 --> 1:24:31.568
It's brilliant.

1:24:47.851 --> 1:24:50.152
Oh, my baby.

1:24:59.195 --> 1:25:01.465
- I love you.
- I love you too.

1:25:38.267 --> 1:25:41.404
<i>We always knew
when he'd been to visit...</i>

1:25:43.974 --> 1:25:47.276
<i>Because he'd leave us
a piece of his adventures.</i>

1:26:03.359 --> 1:26:04.594
Rose?

1:26:07.030 --> 1:26:08.665
<i>The world fresh</i>

1:26:08.699 --> 1:26:12.201
<i>and full of possibilities
once again.</i>

1:26:20.010 --> 1:26:23.980
"For he comes, human child

1:26:24.014 --> 1:26:26.516
"To the woods and waters wild

1:26:27.349 --> 1:26:30.587
"With a faery, hand in hand

1:26:30.620 --> 1:26:34.791
"for the world's more full of
weeping than he can understand."

1:26:44.634 --> 1:26:46.870
Mama, what's wrong?

1:26:52.943 --> 1:26:54.444
Nothing, Wendy.

1:26:56.079 --> 1:26:57.614
Nothing at all.

1:27:00.382 --> 1:27:01.885
You look lovely, Alice.

1:27:31.915 --> 1:27:34.818
<i>I don't remember
the way to the rabbit hole,</i>

1:27:37.654 --> 1:27:40.757
<i>or the smell
of Neverland's shores...</i>

1:27:57.007 --> 1:27:59.442
<i>But because of my brothers,</i>

1:28:02.712 --> 1:28:05.448
<i>I haven't forgotten
how to dream.</i>
