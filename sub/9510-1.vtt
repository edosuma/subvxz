00:58.893 --> 00:59.957
Moron.

01:00.057 --> 01:01.682
Putz. Where are they biting?

01:01.782 --> 01:04.599
Pop says that he spotted
Catfish Hunter at Indian Slough.

01:04.699 --> 01:08.083
Catfish Hunter? Maybe this
is the year we catch him.

01:08.213 --> 01:11.039
Where do you get that "we" crap?
Got a mouse in your pocket?

01:11.139 --> 01:12.479
That fish belongs to me.

01:12.579 --> 01:15.565
I'll let you visit him when
he's mounted on my wall.

01:15.853 --> 01:17.053
Honey?

01:17.453 --> 01:19.330
You forgot your Thermos.

01:19.693 --> 01:20.762
Hi, Ariel.

01:27.373 --> 01:28.647
See you later.

01:33.733 --> 01:35.246
That's my fish.

02:06.493 --> 02:07.557
That's it.

02:07.657 --> 02:10.610
Come on, just one good bite...

02:12.133 --> 02:13.407
I got you!

02:20.893 --> 02:22.292
Oh, damn.

02:30.213 --> 02:32.517
Hey, dickhead!

02:32.617 --> 02:35.810
Turn that radio down.
You're scaring all the fish away.

02:41.253 --> 02:43.483
Turn the damn radio down, will you?

02:46.013 --> 02:47.969
Who put a bug up your ass?

02:48.893 --> 02:49.962
I saw him.

02:50.813 --> 02:51.957
Catfish Hunter?

02:52.057 --> 02:56.171
After I dropped anchor, he stuck
his head up over by that log.

02:56.333 --> 02:59.564
He looked at me, smiled,
and swam down into the mud.

02:59.773 --> 03:00.842
He smiled?

03:03.173 --> 03:05.607
Holy moly. How big is he this year?

03:05.773 --> 03:09.679
He's as big as a Buick. I would've
had him if you hadn't shown up.

03:09.779 --> 03:12.412
You couldn't catch
crabs from a $10 hooker.

03:12.573 --> 03:14.529
How is your sister, by the way?

03:19.053 --> 03:21.203
I saw Sven down at the dam.

03:21.573 --> 03:23.361
He's says there's a rumor...

03:23.461 --> 03:26.809
that Rick Ragetti's cousin's
coming to buy Chuck's Bait.

03:26.973 --> 03:28.770
An Italian running Chuck's?

03:29.253 --> 03:32.563
We'll have the first mob-run
bait shop in Wabasha.

03:39.853 --> 03:41.040
What're you doing?

03:41.140 --> 03:42.486
I was here first.

03:43.053 --> 03:47.438
I got just as much right
to be here as you do.

03:47.538 --> 03:50.172
You got bad luck.
I don't want you infecting my spot.

03:52.213 --> 03:53.719
Find your own fishing hole.

03:53.819 --> 03:57.001
You got a fart in your brain or something?

03:57.101 --> 03:58.845
And turn that down!

04:00.213 --> 04:01.240
Where you going?

04:01.340 --> 04:02.561
Not far.

04:08.213 --> 04:11.967
What's the matter with that guy?
Getting goofier every year.

04:16.452 --> 04:20.526
You don't have the balls
to take me on anymore!

04:21.012 --> 04:22.918
Ariel's had you neutered!

04:23.018 --> 04:24.924
Let's see what you're made of...

04:27.493 --> 04:29.404
Let that be a lesson to you.

04:29.733 --> 04:31.052
You putz!

04:34.893 --> 04:38.044
All right, you chicken-livered schmeer.

04:42.213 --> 04:43.532
Get out!

04:49.533 --> 04:51.046
Isn't it beautiful?

04:53.693 --> 04:55.126
The lava lamp?

04:56.733 --> 04:58.086
The angel.

04:58.493 --> 05:00.882
Ariel says he watches over the house.

05:01.773 --> 05:06.403
Don't get too used to him. Our house
will be ready soon, then we're out of here.

05:08.253 --> 05:09.925
How long have you been up?

05:10.933 --> 05:12.207
For a while.

05:14.813 --> 05:16.485
What have you been doing?

05:16.613 --> 05:18.046
Watching you.

05:25.573 --> 05:26.797
I'm up!

05:26.897 --> 05:28.451
Yes, you are.

05:28.733 --> 05:29.927
Morning.

05:30.693 --> 05:33.685
Go downstairs.
I'll be right out to make you breakfast.

05:35.493 --> 05:36.687
She hates me.

05:37.493 --> 05:41.088
She doesn't hate you.
She just doesn't like you very much.

05:42.613 --> 05:45.969
I thought I'd check out some reception
halls for the wedding.

05:48.373 --> 05:51.119
I talked to Pop.
He's already booked a place.

05:51.219 --> 05:52.248
He did?

05:52.773 --> 05:53.967
That's great.

05:54.213 --> 05:55.682
Did he get the Radisson?

05:55.782 --> 05:56.782
No.

05:57.253 --> 05:58.520
The Pepin Dance Hall?

05:58.620 --> 06:00.888
That would've been great. But no.

06:02.493 --> 06:04.006
The Majestic Ballroom?

06:04.533 --> 06:05.761
Not even close.

06:06.013 --> 06:07.162
What's left?

06:08.413 --> 06:09.812
Slippery's Tavern.

06:17.173 --> 06:18.237
You're serious.

06:18.337 --> 06:19.882
I know it's not what we wanted.

06:19.982 --> 06:24.162
It's my dream to have it in a bar
with peanut shells on the floor.

06:24.262 --> 06:25.759
It's a tavern.

06:25.859 --> 06:26.922
It's a bar.

06:28.653 --> 06:30.957
I'll call him to cancel. We'll find a place.

06:31.057 --> 06:32.080
Forget it.

06:32.180 --> 06:33.367
Are you sure?

06:33.493 --> 06:35.840
It was my idea to let them
help plan the wedding.

06:35.940 --> 06:37.439
I got to tell you...

06:37.539 --> 06:39.039
it was a great idea.

06:39.139 --> 06:41.363
It's nice to see them get along.

06:41.533 --> 06:43.444
Amazing how well they're getting along.

06:55.453 --> 06:56.480
- Ha!
- Remember "ha"?

06:56.580 --> 07:00.442
You didn't win, I quit.
I got better things to do.

07:00.542 --> 07:01.720
Really? What?

07:01.820 --> 07:04.559
We got a wedding to plan. Remember?

07:04.659 --> 07:05.972
How can I forget?

07:08.013 --> 07:09.200
See you later.

07:09.300 --> 07:10.521
See you later.

07:25.893 --> 07:26.928
Hey, Pop.

07:28.373 --> 07:29.368
He's here.

07:29.468 --> 07:30.842
Catfish Hunter?

07:30.942 --> 07:32.730
He's by the sandbar.

07:32.933 --> 07:36.130
You know the damn fish
is older than I am?

07:36.293 --> 07:37.328
Thanks.

07:41.053 --> 07:42.320
What is this?

07:42.420 --> 07:43.759
That's light beer.

07:43.859 --> 07:48.131
I weight 90 goddamn pounds and
you bring me this slopping foam?

07:48.333 --> 07:52.121
Ariel's got me on a diet because
my cholesterol's too high.

07:52.453 --> 07:54.171
Let me tell you something.

07:54.773 --> 07:58.288
Last Thursday I turned 95 years old.

07:59.133 --> 08:02.330
And I never exercised a day in my life.

08:03.493 --> 08:05.797
Every morning, I wake up...

08:05.897 --> 08:07.690
and I smoke a cigarette.

08:08.053 --> 08:11.682
And then I eat five strips of bacon.

08:11.973 --> 08:15.161
And for lunch I eat a bacon sandwich.

08:15.261 --> 08:17.398
And for a midday snack...

08:17.498 --> 08:18.642
Bacon.

08:18.773 --> 08:21.128
A whole damn plate.

08:21.453 --> 08:24.251
And I usually drink my dinner.

08:24.973 --> 08:28.409
Now, according to all of
them flat-belly experts...

08:28.613 --> 08:32.288
I should've took a dirt
nap, like, 30 years ago.

08:32.493 --> 08:36.725
But each year comes and goes
and I'm still here.

08:37.493 --> 08:39.159
And they keep dying.

08:39.259 --> 08:40.481
You know?

08:40.933 --> 08:42.650
Sometimes I wonder...

08:43.373 --> 08:45.045
if God forgot about me.

08:45.853 --> 08:47.969
It just goes to show you, huh?

08:49.653 --> 08:50.653
What?

08:52.893 --> 08:54.442
Goes to show you what?

08:54.542 --> 08:56.837
What the hell are you talking about?

08:56.937 --> 08:59.759
You said you drink beer, you eat bacon...

08:59.859 --> 09:03.041
and you smoke cigarettes,
and you outlive the experts.

09:03.141 --> 09:04.141
Yeah?

09:04.333 --> 09:05.999
I thought maybe there's a moral.

09:06.099 --> 09:07.998
No, there ain't no moral.

09:08.098 --> 09:10.653
I just like that story.

09:11.893 --> 09:13.246
That's all.

09:16.453 --> 09:18.364
I like that story.

09:23.653 --> 09:25.319
Good afternoon.

09:25.419 --> 09:27.449
It's good to see you, too.

09:27.613 --> 09:30.002
Aren't you beautiful today?

09:31.333 --> 09:32.925
Are you thirsty?

09:33.733 --> 09:35.564
There we go. Drink up.

09:37.173 --> 09:38.322
Drink up.

09:39.213 --> 09:40.612
That's right.

09:41.253 --> 09:44.450
There we go. There we go. Drink up.

09:47.853 --> 09:50.321
Isn't it a glorious afternoon?

09:50.653 --> 09:51.972
It's not bad.

09:52.613 --> 09:54.242
You okay? Feeling all right?

09:54.342 --> 09:55.846
Splendid. Why?

09:56.253 --> 09:59.211
I couldn't help noticing
you were talking to flowers.

09:59.613 --> 10:03.367
Plants and flowers are
living organisms and...

10:03.653 --> 10:07.248
they respond to voice and touch
like any other creature would.

10:07.813 --> 10:09.522
You should try it yourself.

10:09.622 --> 10:13.447
I got a cactus in my bathroom,
but we got nothing to say.

10:16.613 --> 10:18.082
I better get going.

10:18.182 --> 10:19.242
See you.

10:23.253 --> 10:26.290
I'm cooking Cantonese tonight.
Why don't you join us?

10:27.693 --> 10:30.287
Well, I already made other plans.

10:30.893 --> 10:32.282
Are you sure?

10:32.382 --> 10:33.772
Thanks, anyway.

10:33.933 --> 10:35.252
Appreciate it.

10:44.893 --> 10:48.681
<i>What happens when Bonnie and Clyde</i>
<i>turn out to be Bonnie and Bonnie?</i>

10:49.093 --> 10:51.318
<i>"Lesbian Bandits," next on</i> Geraldo.

10:51.418 --> 10:53.760
Lesbians. Yummy.

10:53.860 --> 10:56.242
Wait, it's stuck. Would you...

10:56.893 --> 10:58.565
Yeah, but I like those.

11:00.013 --> 11:01.287
Can I do this?

11:04.373 --> 11:05.931
You must wait.

11:07.573 --> 11:09.484
Why don't we put everything in?

11:10.173 --> 11:11.845
Throw it all in there.

11:15.373 --> 11:17.518
I need to borrow a Phillips screwdriver.

11:17.618 --> 11:20.605
Hi, Jacob. You been here long?

11:21.013 --> 11:22.207
Phillips...

11:22.453 --> 11:24.880
Isn't it time you started dating again?

11:24.980 --> 11:26.088
Who with?

11:26.253 --> 11:29.563
Florence Gilbert, for example,
thinks you're quite a catch.

11:29.773 --> 11:32.048
She looks like Ernest Borgnine.

11:32.533 --> 11:33.800
Is that so bad?

11:33.900 --> 11:35.117
What about Jane Clark?

11:35.217 --> 11:36.959
"Jane of the Jungle."

11:37.059 --> 11:41.444
Got more body hair than I do. She's
a fur bearing mammal, for God's sake.

11:42.053 --> 11:43.399
Doris Zabrinski?

11:43.499 --> 11:46.291
I know she's a little heavy
but she loves to fish.

11:46.613 --> 11:48.205
Doris Zabrinski...

11:48.893 --> 11:50.000
is dead.

11:50.100 --> 11:51.200
She is?

11:51.300 --> 11:55.684
She choked to death on a stack
of pancakes two weeks ago...

11:55.853 --> 11:58.367
at the Lions Club charity breakfast.

12:00.133 --> 12:02.693
I think it's how she
would have wanted to go.

12:05.253 --> 12:06.447
Listen to me...

12:06.853 --> 12:10.641
you can't sit around waiting
for another Ariel to walk into your life.

12:14.253 --> 12:15.891
Thanks for the Phillips.

12:20.093 --> 12:21.088
What?

12:21.188 --> 12:23.129
Remember when you were a kid...

12:23.653 --> 12:26.850
your mother baked that
rhubarb pie for my birthday?

12:28.693 --> 12:30.322
She swelled up like a balloon.

12:30.422 --> 12:31.846
Broke out in hives.

12:32.333 --> 12:34.403
She didn't know she was allergic.

12:34.773 --> 12:35.842
She knew.

12:36.053 --> 12:39.125
She baked it anyway because
she knew it was my favorite.

12:40.253 --> 12:41.679
Why'd you think of that?

12:41.779 --> 12:42.967
I don't know.

12:43.693 --> 12:46.207
I think about things like that all the time.

12:53.413 --> 12:54.637
Are you all right?

12:54.737 --> 12:56.878
Get out and let me watch my program.

12:56.978 --> 12:58.442
Close the door when you go.

12:58.542 --> 13:00.842
I don't want mosquitoes in here.

13:01.333 --> 13:04.803
They're crazy about my
macaroni and cheese dish.

13:51.013 --> 13:52.213
Hello?

14:05.493 --> 14:07.165
Anybody here?

14:16.133 --> 14:17.851
Hey, wait a second!

14:18.253 --> 14:20.323
My name is Max Goldman.

14:21.493 --> 14:24.326
Relax! Would you relax!

14:30.813 --> 14:33.000
Mama, what are you doing?

14:33.100 --> 14:34.599
I'm going to whack him!

14:34.699 --> 14:37.759
- Put that down!
- He try to steal the <i>vino rosso!</i>

14:37.859 --> 14:39.889
You think everyone's doing that!

14:40.213 --> 14:41.208
They are!

14:41.308 --> 14:42.602
This is a small town.

14:42.702 --> 14:44.888
You can trust people here.

14:45.733 --> 14:47.291
Like Antonio?

14:47.733 --> 14:50.531
Next time he touch <i>vino...</i>

14:50.693 --> 14:53.571
I whack his head like a melon!

14:53.813 --> 14:55.087
Holy moly.

14:56.293 --> 14:57.521
I'm so sorry.

14:58.613 --> 15:01.525
My mother is a little bit
too protective of the wine.

15:02.613 --> 15:04.444
So I noticed.

15:05.573 --> 15:08.133
She crushed the grapes herself in Palermo.

15:08.373 --> 15:11.922
It's a rare vintage with a unique bouquet.

15:12.253 --> 15:16.080
Is that a nice way of saying that
the wine smells like her feet?

15:16.180 --> 15:17.180
No.

15:19.693 --> 15:23.447
My name's Max Goldman.
I live in the area here.

15:23.813 --> 15:26.407
Maria Sophia Coletta Ragetti.

15:27.573 --> 15:29.052
That's quite a name.

15:32.853 --> 15:35.003
You're Spaghetti Ragetti's cousin!

15:35.453 --> 15:36.806
Why so surprised?

15:37.213 --> 15:38.487
Holy moly.

15:39.533 --> 15:43.367
I thought... I was expecting
someone that looked like Rick.

15:43.693 --> 15:44.720
How's that?

15:44.820 --> 15:47.122
You know, fat, hairy, homely.

15:47.493 --> 15:49.051
But you're not so fat.

15:49.373 --> 15:51.284
You're a smooth talker.

15:51.773 --> 15:54.526
There's more where that
came from, Miss Ragetti.

15:56.373 --> 15:59.410
When is the bait shop
gonna be back in business?

15:59.933 --> 16:01.207
Bait shop?

16:01.733 --> 16:02.927
What's that?

16:03.053 --> 16:05.248
That's what we call it in Minnesota.

16:05.373 --> 16:06.806
What do you call it?

16:06.973 --> 16:09.806
We call it, I think, <i>ristorante.</i>

16:10.573 --> 16:11.926
<i>Ristorante.</i>

16:13.693 --> 16:16.605
You mean you're going
to turn this into a restaurant?

16:18.293 --> 16:20.002
No, you can't be serious.

16:20.102 --> 16:21.162
Why not?

16:21.733 --> 16:24.761
There's going to be a lot of
noise here, people coming.

16:24.861 --> 16:26.491
Driving with cars.

16:26.613 --> 16:28.205
You'll scare the fish.

16:28.373 --> 16:32.082
This is the land of 10,000 lakes.
Go find another one.

16:32.613 --> 16:35.002
You're wasting your time, I'm telling you.

16:35.253 --> 16:38.281
People are not going to come
down here for Italian...

16:38.381 --> 16:40.933
when we got a Chuck E. Cheese in town.

16:41.093 --> 16:43.482
Listen, I don't know this Cheese person.

16:43.733 --> 16:47.282
But Ragetti's will be a
romantic lakefront <i>ristorante.</i>

16:47.413 --> 16:49.404
It will be special, classy...

16:49.573 --> 16:52.565
somewhere you would never go.

16:54.573 --> 16:55.919
You can say that again.

16:56.019 --> 16:59.201
<i>Via!</i> There's so much to do before
the opening of my <i>ristorante.</i>

16:59.301 --> 17:00.521
Bait shop.

17:00.693 --> 17:01.757
<i>Ristorante.</i>

17:01.857 --> 17:03.047
Bait-a shoppie.

17:15.893 --> 17:17.884
You should've let me whack him.

17:24.413 --> 17:25.641
I'm done.

17:26.413 --> 17:28.797
Pop, I wish you'd try the low-fat bacon.

17:28.897 --> 17:32.640
You can wish in one hand,
and crap in the other...

17:32.740 --> 17:34.878
and see which is filled first.

17:34.978 --> 17:37.965
This wagon's got to get filled first.
I'll be back.

17:39.693 --> 17:41.721
Pick me up a pack of Camels.

17:41.821 --> 17:43.610
All right, you got it.

17:55.813 --> 17:57.610
You need a hand with that?

17:57.813 --> 17:59.963
My name's Gustafson.

18:02.213 --> 18:04.363
Francesca Ragetti.

18:05.133 --> 18:06.442
Italian girl.

18:06.542 --> 18:08.678
Why don't you come back to my place?

18:08.778 --> 18:11.082
I'll show you my cannelloni.

18:20.293 --> 18:21.288
How you doing?

18:21.388 --> 18:22.383
Fine.

18:28.693 --> 18:29.693
Ox!

18:33.973 --> 18:34.973
Nag!

18:38.013 --> 18:39.077
Hey, moron.

18:39.177 --> 18:41.600
Putz. Where you been?
I've been looking for you.

18:41.700 --> 18:42.917
What's so important?

18:43.017 --> 18:44.017
That.

18:52.693 --> 18:54.721
Jeez Louise, who is that?

18:54.821 --> 18:56.718
That's Spaghetti Ragetti's cousin.

18:56.818 --> 18:59.038
You mean she's going
to run the bait shop?

18:59.138 --> 19:00.566
<i>Ristorante.</i>

19:01.413 --> 19:05.804
Forget about leaving your boat there.
It's all private property.

19:06.293 --> 19:09.279
Chuck'd be spinning in his
grave if he knew about this.

19:09.379 --> 19:10.517
You can say that again.

19:10.617 --> 19:12.917
I guess there's nothing much we can do.

19:13.017 --> 19:15.971
You're just going to stand
there and let this happen?

19:16.693 --> 19:20.759
I've been fishing that spot ever since
I'm 5 years old. It's all I got left.

19:20.859 --> 19:22.519
What can I do about it?

19:22.619 --> 19:24.604
We must come up with a plan.

19:24.813 --> 19:28.010
We must find a way to put
the kibosh on all this mess.

19:30.813 --> 19:32.362
It's okay!

19:32.462 --> 19:33.932
I'm a doctor!

19:35.013 --> 19:37.919
Sounds like Dad's using his "free exam"
trick again.

19:38.019 --> 19:40.083
You got to stick with what works.

19:40.973 --> 19:44.677
Ask Jacob if he can pull some
strings with the city council.

19:44.777 --> 19:48.477
Find out what day this
<i>ristorante</i> has its health inspection.

19:48.577 --> 19:50.131
I think I got an idea.

19:53.133 --> 19:54.442
Good thinking.

19:54.542 --> 19:55.542
Dad!

19:57.453 --> 20:00.570
Max is right. Our fishing
spot'll be totally ruined.

20:00.693 --> 20:02.598
They may as well drain the lake.

20:02.698 --> 20:03.837
Stop moving.

20:03.937 --> 20:08.370
You know the sign she put up?
"Parking for restaurant customers only."

20:08.613 --> 20:10.365
Just a little while longer.

20:10.613 --> 20:13.120
Maybe the kitchen'll have a big grease fire.

20:13.220 --> 20:15.090
A guy can dream, can't he?

20:15.653 --> 20:19.282
You got to let this thing go, honey.
Let it go.

20:19.493 --> 20:22.610
Chuck is gone, the bait shop
is gone, things move on.

20:23.093 --> 20:24.924
I suggest you do the same.

20:27.853 --> 20:29.081
Stop fidgeting.

20:29.813 --> 20:32.879
I don't know why the hell I ever
let you talk me into doing this.

20:32.979 --> 20:35.719
If Max could see me now,
I'd never live it down.

20:35.819 --> 20:38.719
Would you relax?
We're the only ones here.

20:38.819 --> 20:41.088
No one's here but you and me.

20:54.413 --> 20:56.290
What a putz.

20:57.093 --> 20:59.653
Will you look at that poor man?

21:03.213 --> 21:05.842
And then the mama bear said:

21:05.942 --> 21:09.369
"Somebody's been
sleeping in my bed, too."

21:09.573 --> 21:11.957
And finally, the baby bear...

21:12.057 --> 21:15.321
looked and said, " Somebody's
been sleeping in my bed...

21:15.421 --> 21:17.881
"and the bastard's still there."

21:19.133 --> 21:23.570
But Goldilocks had a Remington
semi-automatic...

21:24.333 --> 21:26.797
with a scope and a hair trigger.

21:26.897 --> 21:29.009
That's not the way it goes.

21:29.253 --> 21:30.652
That was the end...

21:32.053 --> 21:34.408
of the three bears.

21:35.013 --> 21:36.605
Sing me a lullaby.

21:38.293 --> 21:39.612
It's too late.

21:39.893 --> 21:41.293
Please?

22:58.693 --> 23:00.251
Good night, sweet pea.

23:01.733 --> 23:03.007
Good night.

23:04.653 --> 23:06.052
Happy dreams.

23:19.413 --> 23:23.292
That leaves Uncle Willy
sitting next to the plant lady.

23:23.533 --> 23:25.997
I'm not sticking the plant lady next to him.

23:26.097 --> 23:27.200
Why not?

23:27.300 --> 23:30.808
Because he's a groper.
He'll be all over her.

23:31.093 --> 23:34.478
He's not a groper.
He's a touchy-feely person.

23:34.578 --> 23:37.362
He's not going to be touchy-feely
with the plant lady.

23:37.462 --> 23:40.721
She's not a close friend. We don't
know her name. "The plant lady."

23:40.821 --> 23:41.821
What the hell is that?

23:41.933 --> 23:43.961
That doesn't mean
she's not important to me.

23:44.061 --> 23:45.061
Fine.

23:45.173 --> 23:46.173
Good.

23:47.013 --> 23:49.481
Honey, don't put the quarter
in your mouth.

23:49.653 --> 23:51.086
You're not my daddy.

23:51.773 --> 23:53.040
What have you got there?

23:53.140 --> 23:54.639
A bacon sandwich.

23:54.739 --> 23:56.564
What are you doing?

23:57.013 --> 23:59.129
Finishing the seating arrangement.

23:59.293 --> 24:02.199
Don't bother.
Max and I already have a plan.

24:02.299 --> 24:04.932
You guys have done
way too much already.

24:06.013 --> 24:07.412
Hello, children.

24:08.413 --> 24:09.440
Moron.

24:09.540 --> 24:10.540
Putz.

24:11.213 --> 24:12.413
You...

24:12.773 --> 24:13.800
find the rat?

24:13.900 --> 24:15.958
No, but Allie said we can borrow Sparky.

24:16.058 --> 24:17.566
What if he gets away?

24:17.933 --> 24:19.161
I made a leash.

24:20.413 --> 24:21.607
Good thinking.

24:22.093 --> 24:23.765
What do you guys want with Sparky?

24:24.013 --> 24:25.008
Wait.

24:25.108 --> 24:26.606
I don't want to know.

24:27.093 --> 24:28.280
It's men talk.

24:28.380 --> 24:29.647
See you later.

24:30.493 --> 24:31.972
Where's the quarter?

24:36.013 --> 24:37.562
Did you swallow a quarter?

24:37.662 --> 24:38.840
I'll call the doctor.

24:38.940 --> 24:40.077
Relax.

24:40.177 --> 24:42.360
Kids swallow quarters all the time.

24:42.460 --> 24:43.480
Really?

24:43.580 --> 24:47.486
Sure. If she craps out
two dimes and a nickel...

24:47.653 --> 24:49.803
then you can start worrying, huh?

24:51.653 --> 24:52.722
Come here.

24:59.213 --> 25:02.011
...personally clean every little corner.

25:02.373 --> 25:03.601
Just look.

25:03.893 --> 25:05.042
Like a mirror.

25:05.733 --> 25:09.123
Miss Ragetti, everything appears
to be up to our standards.

25:09.293 --> 25:10.639
I'm very glad.

25:10.739 --> 25:13.691
Of course, appearances can be deceiving.

25:13.813 --> 25:15.007
We'll see.

25:17.293 --> 25:18.517
What do you think? Now?

25:18.617 --> 25:20.082
Unleash the beast.

25:20.182 --> 25:23.802
You'll wear a hair net
when you're cooking?

25:24.453 --> 25:25.568
Say yes.

25:29.893 --> 25:31.117
What did she say?

25:31.217 --> 25:33.932
She said, "Yes, sir, of course."

25:36.573 --> 25:38.239
Everything seems to be in order.

25:38.339 --> 25:39.440
Act rabid.

25:39.540 --> 25:40.531
Be rabid.

25:40.631 --> 25:42.331
Good luck to you, schmuck.

25:48.013 --> 25:49.008
What?

25:49.108 --> 25:50.242
It's a rat!

25:50.413 --> 25:52.051
A rat? Here?

25:52.173 --> 25:53.811
Vermin infestation!

25:54.013 --> 25:55.120
I'm writing you up.

25:55.220 --> 25:56.220
Wait.

25:59.613 --> 26:01.569
It's not a rat, it's a...

26:02.453 --> 26:03.852
It's a guinea pig.

26:05.413 --> 26:06.600
It's a guinea pig.

26:06.700 --> 26:10.078
What are the chances that a guinea
pig would run through here...

26:10.178 --> 26:11.845
on an inspection day?

26:14.653 --> 26:18.441
Well, lately, I must say that
the chances are pretty good.

26:22.773 --> 26:23.773
Ox.

26:23.933 --> 26:24.933
Nag.

26:26.533 --> 26:28.119
I don't think we've met.

26:28.219 --> 26:29.566
I'm Maria Ragetti.

26:29.693 --> 26:31.809
John Gustafson.

26:33.453 --> 26:35.842
You like Italian, Mr. Gustafson?

26:36.133 --> 26:38.328
Yeah, I guess so. Why?

26:40.133 --> 26:41.486
<i>Buon appetito!</i>

26:47.253 --> 26:49.244
<i>Arrivederci,</i> boys.

26:57.493 --> 27:00.132
Should we ask her for some garlic bread?

28:08.213 --> 28:09.885
How could I be so wrong?

28:10.213 --> 28:11.879
You have a gift.

28:11.979 --> 28:14.123
Not one customer all day.

28:14.653 --> 28:16.530
I mean, besides him.

28:18.453 --> 28:20.683
More <i>vino, seÃ±orita!</i>

28:21.693 --> 28:22.757
You go.

28:22.857 --> 28:24.491
It's your turn.

28:25.893 --> 28:27.645
I put his bib on.

28:33.053 --> 28:34.930
What's the matter, beautiful?

28:35.053 --> 28:36.964
You're meaner than a dog...

28:37.173 --> 28:38.686
shitting tacks.

28:38.973 --> 28:42.170
We put everything into this place.

28:42.333 --> 28:44.847
We could've retired in Hawaii.

28:45.013 --> 28:46.924
I have been to Hawaii.

28:47.133 --> 28:48.400
Which island?

28:48.500 --> 28:50.211
Come-on-l-want-to-lay-you.

28:51.133 --> 28:52.964
I find you disgusting.

28:53.653 --> 28:55.928
Just as long as you find me.

28:57.773 --> 29:00.526
You want to join me, Ms. Ragetti?

29:04.093 --> 29:05.412
What the hell.

29:05.613 --> 29:07.046
That a girl.

29:12.173 --> 29:14.767
Ding, dong, the witch is dead.

29:15.933 --> 29:17.482
Here's to us.

29:17.582 --> 29:19.079
And to those like us.

29:19.179 --> 29:21.243
Yeah, there's damn few of us left.

29:21.533 --> 29:23.205
That's a damn good thing.

29:24.573 --> 29:25.767
To Chuck.

29:26.533 --> 29:29.001
May his bait shop never die.

29:48.613 --> 29:49.762
Get dressed.

29:49.893 --> 29:51.485
We go to town.

30:47.173 --> 30:49.050
Praise the Lord.

30:52.093 --> 30:53.765
Holy moly.

30:54.813 --> 30:56.405
Is this seat taken?

31:03.933 --> 31:05.252
Beware.

31:05.493 --> 31:08.087
The devil is a beautiful lady in a red dress.

31:08.253 --> 31:10.680
Can I get you something, ma'am?

31:10.780 --> 31:13.077
Yes, please. It's so hot in here.

31:13.177 --> 31:14.237
Maybe some...

31:14.337 --> 31:15.962
ice water will cool me down.

31:16.062 --> 31:17.168
Yes, ma'am.

31:21.653 --> 31:23.159
I've been thinking...

31:23.259 --> 31:25.962
it's such a shame we
got off on the wrong foot.

31:26.062 --> 31:27.160
It's a shame.

31:27.260 --> 31:30.768
I'll bet if we give it
another chance, we could...

31:31.453 --> 31:32.762
become good friends.

31:32.862 --> 31:33.917
Friends?

31:34.017 --> 31:35.287
Or maybe...

31:35.413 --> 31:37.483
even more than friends.

31:40.533 --> 31:43.093
Go easy. Go easy, baby.

31:46.853 --> 31:48.881
This feels so much better.

31:48.981 --> 31:50.326
So nice.

31:51.573 --> 31:53.006
So cool.

31:54.813 --> 31:56.007
So nice.

31:58.333 --> 31:59.766
How do you feel?

32:00.013 --> 32:01.918
Friendly, friendly.

32:02.018 --> 32:03.918
I wish I could feel like you do...

32:04.018 --> 32:07.688
but this silly feud of
ours has got me so upset.

32:07.973 --> 32:09.486
What silly feud?

32:10.653 --> 32:13.326
It's a tiny little <i>ristorante.</i>

32:13.653 --> 32:15.601
You will never even know...

32:15.701 --> 32:16.967
it's there.

32:17.453 --> 32:18.959
<i>Ristorante...</i>

32:19.059 --> 32:20.253
never!

32:20.813 --> 32:22.565
You are a stubborn man.

32:23.213 --> 32:26.241
Ragetti's will be a very great success!

32:26.341 --> 32:27.397
You shall see!

32:27.497 --> 32:29.370
Not in my lifetime!

32:32.013 --> 32:34.083
You evil temptress!

32:41.173 --> 32:42.492
Maria Ragetti?

32:43.293 --> 32:44.965
How do you know who I am?

32:45.773 --> 32:48.679
You do sort of stand
out in a town like this.

32:48.779 --> 32:50.764
I don't usually dress like this.

32:51.773 --> 32:53.684
You look very nice.

32:54.173 --> 32:55.925
I look like...

32:56.413 --> 32:57.528
a slut.

32:57.893 --> 32:59.451
But a nice slut.

33:00.453 --> 33:03.763
I want to introduce myself.
My name is Ariel Gustafson.

33:03.933 --> 33:08.643
I want to say how sorry I am for what
Max and John are putting you through.

33:09.133 --> 33:12.125
You know how some people have
trouble saying goodbye?

33:12.533 --> 33:15.206
Believe me, it has nothing to do with you.

33:16.373 --> 33:19.092
Why do you say such
nice things? You don't know me.

33:19.733 --> 33:22.884
Because I know what it's like
to be the new kid in town.

33:28.013 --> 33:29.642
Here comes another one.

33:29.742 --> 33:30.877
Hello, boys.

33:30.977 --> 33:32.486
Honey, how was class?

33:33.773 --> 33:36.120
You two must be happy with yourselves.

33:36.220 --> 33:39.011
I just ran into Maria and she's in tears.

33:39.173 --> 33:41.121
She thinks everyone hates her.

33:41.221 --> 33:42.277
She's right.

33:42.377 --> 33:45.481
John, I want you to go right
down to Ragetti's and apologize.

33:45.581 --> 33:46.637
For what?

33:46.737 --> 33:48.042
We tried to explain to her.

33:48.142 --> 33:49.639
She should've listened to us.

33:49.739 --> 33:51.644
I'll meet you at home, honey.

33:57.573 --> 34:01.958
I always knew you were on a short leash,
but not that you were on a choke collar.

34:02.058 --> 34:05.250
Nobody's in charge at
my house except me.

34:05.733 --> 34:07.958
That's the way to talk, Gustafson.

34:08.058 --> 34:10.681
I'm going home and get this
matter straightened out.

34:10.782 --> 34:13.360
You're the man of the house,
the king of the castle.

34:13.460 --> 34:14.886
Max, top her off?

34:15.813 --> 34:17.292
Long live the king!

34:21.293 --> 34:22.646
She threw me out.

34:23.132 --> 34:25.437
- Come on, just for tonight.
- Forget it.

34:25.536 --> 34:26.922
You won't know I'm here!

34:27.022 --> 34:28.366
You won't be here.

34:33.172 --> 34:34.172
What?

34:34.293 --> 34:35.646
I'm cold.

34:38.933 --> 34:41.322
Here's some matches. Set yourself on fire.

34:59.653 --> 35:02.963
You got three TVs on.
You're not looking at any of them.

35:21.893 --> 35:23.042
What a pig.

35:23.853 --> 35:27.641
That's my tuna on rye.
I've been looking all over for that.

35:28.013 --> 35:29.207
Where did you find it?

35:29.333 --> 35:30.812
Would you like half?

35:46.613 --> 35:48.365
This milk has chunks in it.

35:48.733 --> 35:50.132
What's your point?

36:00.893 --> 36:02.212
What am I doing?

36:02.893 --> 36:04.080
Next door...

36:04.180 --> 36:06.562
I've got a beautiful wife, my own bed...

36:06.733 --> 36:10.198
and a refrigerator full
of food that hasn't expired.

36:10.298 --> 36:11.357
What're you saying?

36:11.457 --> 36:14.490
I'm going down to
Ragetti's to apologize to Maria.

36:14.693 --> 36:17.491
You traitor! You Benedict Arnold!

36:19.333 --> 36:20.360
Finally.

36:20.460 --> 36:22.523
Never thought he'd last this long.

36:29.173 --> 36:30.572
Smells all right.

36:32.733 --> 36:35.167
Why, all of a sudden, this change of heart?

36:35.293 --> 36:37.090
I had a guilty conscience.

36:38.813 --> 36:41.122
Ariel kicked me out of the house.

36:41.733 --> 36:43.405
I knew I liked your wife.

36:44.573 --> 36:45.847
What about Max?

36:46.213 --> 36:50.119
Oh, my God, forget it. Max is much
too hardheaded to ever say he's sorry.

36:50.219 --> 36:51.277
He's proud.

36:51.377 --> 36:52.370
Of what?

36:52.470 --> 36:55.439
I don't know. He has a strong
character, and I admire that.

36:55.539 --> 36:56.886
You admire Max?

36:57.293 --> 36:59.284
You really are from out of town.

37:02.813 --> 37:05.442
Be careful. The grappa is very strong.

37:05.542 --> 37:09.572
You are speaking to a Gustafson.
I can hold my liquor. And this stuff, too.

37:12.173 --> 37:13.519
How long have you been married?

37:13.619 --> 37:16.801
Six months next week. How about you?

37:16.901 --> 37:18.037
I'm divorced.

37:18.137 --> 37:19.320
I'm sorry.

37:19.420 --> 37:20.641
Antonio was...

37:23.373 --> 37:24.719
That sounds bad.

37:24.819 --> 37:26.087
It ain't good.

37:26.533 --> 37:27.966
Oh, jeez.

37:28.333 --> 37:29.607
Enough of that.

37:29.733 --> 37:31.451
I don't want to bore you.

37:49.253 --> 37:51.084
Good night, Ariel.

38:27.093 --> 38:28.679
Hey, Jacob. How are you?

38:28.779 --> 38:30.411
Thanks for the Phillips.

38:31.533 --> 38:32.602
Listen...

38:33.333 --> 38:36.052
Melanie and I wanted to
thank you and John...

38:36.453 --> 38:39.359
Melanie and I just wanted
you and John to know...

38:39.459 --> 38:42.721
how much we appreciate all the help
you've given us with the wedding.

38:42.821 --> 38:44.531
No need to thank me.

38:45.453 --> 38:46.681
Yes, but...

38:47.133 --> 38:50.842
Nothing would make us happier
than to see you tying the knot.

38:51.093 --> 38:52.242
Thanks.

38:52.933 --> 38:56.289
And it means a great deal
to me to be a part of it.

38:57.053 --> 38:58.805
I'm proud of you.

39:01.053 --> 39:02.884
Studying up on your Italian?

39:03.853 --> 39:05.482
Thinking of wooing Maria?

39:05.582 --> 39:09.009
No, I'm going to curse at her in
her own language, that's all.

39:10.413 --> 39:12.369
I think she's a lesbian anyway.

39:12.493 --> 39:14.202
You've never even seen a lesbian.

39:14.302 --> 39:16.887
I did, too. Saw them on <i>Geraldo.</i>

39:17.013 --> 39:19.722
Say what you will. I think
you got the hots for her.

39:19.822 --> 39:24.045
Not in a million years. She's
just a pigheaded Italian witch...

39:24.173 --> 39:26.892
with piss and vinegar
running through her veins.

39:30.093 --> 39:31.321
He's in love.

39:49.973 --> 39:51.240
Where're you off to?

39:51.340 --> 39:55.485
Sven saw Catfish Hunter at Indian Slough.
Thought I'd go look.

39:57.053 --> 39:58.486
Where's Tweedledum?

40:05.333 --> 40:06.839
I don't know.

40:06.939 --> 40:09.845
You don't know? He didn't
spend the night here?

40:10.053 --> 40:14.126
No. Last night he said he was going
to Ragetti's to apologize to Maria.

40:17.333 --> 40:19.722
You mean to tell me he didn't come home?

40:31.253 --> 40:32.642
He's alive.

40:32.742 --> 40:34.000
Take these.

40:34.100 --> 40:35.562
What happened?

40:35.662 --> 40:36.717
You passed out.

40:36.817 --> 40:39.043
I didn't think you should drive home.

40:39.493 --> 40:42.530
I feel like a polka band
is playing in my head.

40:42.773 --> 40:44.684
You'll feel better after a hot shower.

40:47.893 --> 40:49.804
But I don't really need a hot shower.

40:54.013 --> 40:55.402
What if he had an accident?

40:55.502 --> 40:58.521
The only accident he's going
to have is when I see him.

40:58.621 --> 41:01.279
I'm sure there's a logical
explanation for all this.

41:01.379 --> 41:04.082
It must be nice, living in never-never land.

41:04.182 --> 41:07.848
Maybe I'll visit you sometime
when I need a break from reality.

41:11.213 --> 41:12.328
Step on it.

41:30.413 --> 41:32.529
He's going to explain everything...

41:32.653 --> 41:34.484
and I'll listen carefully...

41:34.933 --> 41:36.242
then I'll kill him.

41:36.342 --> 41:38.289
I'm sure there's a logical explanation.

41:40.933 --> 41:42.242
Where is he?

41:42.342 --> 41:46.000
- We know he's in here! Where is he?
- Don't deny it!

41:46.100 --> 41:47.642
You don't understand.

41:47.742 --> 41:49.239
I want to talk to him now.

41:49.339 --> 41:50.971
Well, let me explain!

41:54.373 --> 41:55.762
What's going on here?

41:55.862 --> 41:57.077
Nothing happened.

41:57.177 --> 41:58.360
Where's John?

41:58.460 --> 41:59.806
Wait a minute!

42:10.813 --> 42:12.531
How could you?

42:12.733 --> 42:15.042
This isn't what it looks like.

42:15.853 --> 42:18.078
Gustafson, you're doing it again!

42:18.178 --> 42:19.440
What are you talking about?

42:19.540 --> 42:22.093
First it was May! Then it was Ariel!

42:22.413 --> 42:24.042
And now it's Maria!

42:24.142 --> 42:26.842
Watch that damn thing.
You said you hated Maria.

42:26.942 --> 42:28.402
That's not the point!

42:28.502 --> 42:30.797
You're the one who said
I should apologize.

42:30.897 --> 42:33.522
Apologize, yes. Not sleep with her.

42:33.622 --> 42:34.922
There is a difference.

42:35.022 --> 42:36.838
You think we had sex?

42:36.938 --> 42:39.200
You sure weren't having sex with me.

42:39.300 --> 42:42.721
Why should I have sex with you?
You said you hated me!

42:42.821 --> 42:45.841
He said I hated you!
I never said I hated you!

42:45.941 --> 42:48.919
Actually, I've grown quite fond of you!

42:49.019 --> 42:53.052
So now I'm supposed to have
sex with you instead of him!

42:53.853 --> 42:55.998
So you admit you slept with my husband!

42:56.098 --> 42:58.049
Nobody slept with anybody.

42:59.773 --> 43:01.729
Speak for yourself.

43:13.093 --> 43:14.918
I had too much to drink last night.

43:15.018 --> 43:16.924
Sure. Blame it on the booze.

43:17.053 --> 43:20.119
You think that's an acceptable
excuse for what you did?

43:20.219 --> 43:21.805
Are you gonna let me finish?

43:24.173 --> 43:28.000
I know my Maria. She don't want
nothing to do with that man.

43:28.100 --> 43:29.482
How do you know?

43:29.582 --> 43:30.801
Because!

43:31.693 --> 43:34.207
She wants that man!

43:41.093 --> 43:42.093
Me?

43:43.013 --> 43:44.651
What do you want with me?

43:49.173 --> 43:50.642
What does that mean?

43:50.742 --> 43:53.770
"I'd rather kiss a dead moose's butt!"

43:57.253 --> 43:58.766
So, I'll call you?

44:09.133 --> 44:10.805
Three tiers like this.

44:11.773 --> 44:16.238
The lemon cake with the white frosting
and the yellow flowers. You like?

44:16.338 --> 44:17.440
Perfect.

44:17.540 --> 44:18.720
It's exactly what we wanted.

44:18.820 --> 44:19.920
And now...

44:20.020 --> 44:21.801
for the big surprise.

44:21.901 --> 44:23.037
What surprise?

44:23.137 --> 44:24.400
We don't want surprises.

44:24.500 --> 44:26.882
John thought of this one all by himself.

44:27.653 --> 44:29.291
The groom goes here.

44:30.333 --> 44:31.732
And the bride...

44:32.173 --> 44:33.925
goes on top, like this.

44:34.373 --> 44:36.284
And then this goes here.

44:38.733 --> 44:41.761
And then on top of the
cake, in the frosting...

44:41.861 --> 44:43.127
we spell out:

44:43.253 --> 44:46.928
"Melanie has landed
herself another husband."

44:50.493 --> 44:51.846
This is not good.

44:52.813 --> 44:55.103
<i>Maria</i>

44:55.203 --> 44:59.132
<i>I just met a girl named Maria</i>

44:59.293 --> 45:01.853
<i>And suddenly I see</i>

45:02.013 --> 45:03.562
<i>She's not the bitch</i>

45:03.662 --> 45:05.803
<i>I thought she'd be</i>

45:29.813 --> 45:30.813
Ox.

45:30.933 --> 45:31.933
Nag.

45:32.453 --> 45:34.728
I didn't know you were a fisherman.

45:34.933 --> 45:37.163
There's a lot you don't know about me.

45:38.213 --> 45:39.532
Any luck?

45:48.893 --> 45:50.406
Holy moly!

45:52.933 --> 45:55.925
I showed you mine,
now you show me yours.

45:56.893 --> 45:58.292
You mean the fish.

46:02.493 --> 46:04.688
It ain't the size that matters.

46:05.893 --> 46:08.123
Are we still talking about your fish?

46:10.813 --> 46:12.132
Very funny.

46:12.973 --> 46:14.197
You know...

46:14.297 --> 46:16.124
I've lived here all my life.

46:16.333 --> 46:20.645
Nobody knows about this place any
more than I do. I know everything.

46:21.333 --> 46:23.608
I could take you around sometime...

46:23.933 --> 46:25.969
if you would like it.

46:26.373 --> 46:27.959
Are you asking me on a date?

46:28.059 --> 46:29.645
Hell, no.

46:30.533 --> 46:33.366
But if I were, and I'm not,
what would you say?

46:34.213 --> 46:37.598
If I were to accept, and
I'm not saying I would...

46:37.698 --> 46:39.604
Because I haven't asked you.

46:40.573 --> 46:42.325
I would say...

46:43.453 --> 46:44.886
What would you say?

46:46.333 --> 46:47.360
Maybe.

46:47.460 --> 46:49.967
Maybe? What kind of
an answer is "Maybe"?

46:50.213 --> 46:51.805
Maybe's maybe.

46:52.933 --> 46:55.970
Then maybe I'll stop by at 7:00 tonight.

46:56.213 --> 46:59.205
Maybe I'll cook something
nice for you in the kitchen.

46:59.573 --> 47:01.159
I'll see you then.

47:01.259 --> 47:02.453
Maybe.

47:10.853 --> 47:12.081
Whatever that means.

47:12.853 --> 47:14.286
What do you think?

47:18.893 --> 47:21.088
Does it make me look fat?

47:21.693 --> 47:25.041
You should be so picky.
He's got the face of a mackerel.

47:25.141 --> 47:28.330
Antonio had the face of an
angel and look where it got me.

47:28.573 --> 47:32.009
How many times do you have
to get your heart broken?

47:32.293 --> 47:35.330
Max is different, Mama.
He makes me laugh.

47:35.653 --> 47:38.117
I don't like this. Not one bit.

47:38.217 --> 47:41.321
But it's just a date. I'm not marrying him.

47:41.421 --> 47:42.557
Not yet.

47:42.657 --> 47:43.802
"Not yet."

47:45.693 --> 47:48.002
Are you sure you like the white better?

47:51.533 --> 47:53.205
Definitely the blue.

47:56.413 --> 47:57.759
I'm a little nervous.

47:57.859 --> 47:58.968
Oh, come on.

48:00.013 --> 48:02.208
Just be yourself. You'll be fine.

48:04.693 --> 48:08.440
Why don't you pick up a bottle of wine
on the way? She'll appreciate it.

48:08.540 --> 48:09.733
Check.

48:10.133 --> 48:13.358
And don't forget. Compliment
her on how great she looks.

48:13.458 --> 48:16.365
- Already got that covered.
- Let me hear it.

48:21.613 --> 48:24.332
There may be lots of fish in the sea...

48:24.853 --> 48:28.766
but you're the only one I would
like to mount over my fireplace.

48:31.653 --> 48:33.484
That's not... bad.

48:34.133 --> 48:36.560
You notice the sexual innuendo?

48:36.660 --> 48:37.853
I did.

48:38.653 --> 48:40.362
Subliminal messages.

48:40.462 --> 48:44.359
It's how you get people to do what
you want without them knowing it.

48:44.459 --> 48:46.518
- Where'd you learn that?
<i>- Geraldo.</i>

48:46.618 --> 48:47.887
Oh, boy.

48:50.613 --> 48:52.126
Very nice.

48:52.653 --> 48:57.480
I went to Nate's Auto Body Shop.
Had all the seats refinished.

48:57.580 --> 48:59.689
It's authentic imitation leather.

49:02.253 --> 49:05.450
Go get them, tiger.
You got nothing to worry about.

49:13.133 --> 49:14.725
He's doomed.

49:48.493 --> 49:51.053
There are many fish in the sea, Maria...

49:51.493 --> 49:55.281
but you're the only one
I want to mount over my fireplace.

49:56.053 --> 49:57.850
You're the only one...

50:08.853 --> 50:10.366
Holy moly.

50:12.853 --> 50:14.605
Good evening, Maria.

50:14.853 --> 50:16.081
Good evening.

50:16.973 --> 50:18.406
You look nice.

50:18.533 --> 50:19.761
Thank you.

50:23.493 --> 50:25.165
I just want to say...

50:25.853 --> 50:27.730
What I'm trying to say is...

50:28.013 --> 50:30.573
There are many women
floating in the river...

50:31.013 --> 50:33.440
but you're the only one I want to stuff...

50:33.540 --> 50:34.966
and stick over...

50:35.253 --> 50:36.360
on my wall...

50:36.460 --> 50:38.091
over the fireplace.

50:39.653 --> 50:41.405
Thank you so much.

50:43.693 --> 50:45.411
Would you like to come in?

50:46.293 --> 50:47.362
Please.

50:49.773 --> 50:51.331
I didn't say it right.

50:54.053 --> 50:57.443
I've never seen wine that
comes from a box before.

50:57.693 --> 50:59.322
It's pretty fancy, huh?

50:59.422 --> 51:01.483
Look, it's even got it's own tap.

51:02.173 --> 51:04.164
Look at this. Here. You got it?

51:07.053 --> 51:09.089
- It's real wine.
- That's great.

51:12.533 --> 51:14.763
So, how do you like the old place?

51:15.733 --> 51:17.086
It's changed.

51:17.773 --> 51:19.918
Is that good or bad?

51:20.018 --> 51:21.287
It's the worst.

51:21.533 --> 51:22.640
I hate change.

51:22.740 --> 51:23.740
Why?

51:23.973 --> 51:26.282
Things never change for the better.

51:26.493 --> 51:28.688
Change brought me here to Wabasha.

51:30.013 --> 51:32.447
Are you saying you wish I hadn't come?

51:34.533 --> 51:36.444
Is that a trick question?

51:37.893 --> 51:39.326
You see?

51:39.813 --> 51:41.362
Now the weather has changed.

51:41.462 --> 51:43.489
So much for dining al fresco.

51:44.733 --> 51:46.291
Holy moly.

51:51.413 --> 51:52.971
I'm all wet.

51:55.773 --> 51:57.729
It's really coming down.

51:58.693 --> 52:01.651
You know, the night
crawlers'll be out soon.

52:02.013 --> 52:03.651
What's a night crawler?

52:05.093 --> 52:06.811
What are you, a communist?

52:08.133 --> 52:10.522
Night crawler's the king of all worms.

52:10.773 --> 52:14.121
They come out at night,
after the rain, to lay out on the grass.

52:14.221 --> 52:15.771
Breathe the night air.

52:16.413 --> 52:20.761
This restaurant is sitting on top of
one of the biggest and best worm beds...

52:20.861 --> 52:22.525
in all of Wabasha County.

52:23.733 --> 52:25.644
You can imagine my excitement.

52:29.853 --> 52:34.131
Honey, stop worrying.
Max will be just fine.

52:34.813 --> 52:36.246
I hope so.

52:37.493 --> 52:40.053
I may have given him
some bad advice earlier.

52:40.893 --> 52:42.212
What'd you say?

52:42.653 --> 52:43.972
I told him...

52:45.453 --> 52:46.966
I told him...

52:47.213 --> 52:48.566
to just be himself.

52:49.293 --> 52:50.487
You said what?

52:50.933 --> 52:54.760
Don't shine the light on them.
They zip back into their holes.

52:54.860 --> 52:56.040
So I should...

52:56.140 --> 52:57.160
Like this?

52:57.260 --> 52:58.599
Up, down. Yeah.

52:58.699 --> 52:59.960
You know...

53:00.060 --> 53:02.357
that worms have both...

53:02.457 --> 53:05.439
male and female sexual organs?

53:05.539 --> 53:07.800
No, I didn't know that.

53:07.900 --> 53:08.957
It's true.

53:09.057 --> 53:11.517
You know a lot about worms, Max.

53:11.617 --> 53:13.561
I don't know that much.

53:13.661 --> 53:14.840
You do.

53:14.940 --> 53:17.208
Every once in a while I pick up a tip.

53:17.813 --> 53:19.326
That's it. Good.

53:19.773 --> 53:21.001
There's one.

53:21.933 --> 53:23.082
There.

53:23.453 --> 53:25.205
Quietly now.

53:25.373 --> 53:27.443
- What should I do?
- Tiptoe over.

53:29.053 --> 53:32.481
And then suddenly,
reach down and grab him.

53:32.581 --> 53:35.133
When you get near him, grab him.

53:40.733 --> 53:42.246
You all right, Maria?

53:43.293 --> 53:46.721
You scared every worm away
for a radius of five miles.

53:46.821 --> 53:48.041
I'm sorry.

53:54.133 --> 53:55.133
What?

53:55.453 --> 53:58.013
You have a very beautiful smile.

54:03.253 --> 54:05.528
Would it be all right if I kissed you?

54:07.053 --> 54:08.053
Yes.

54:19.813 --> 54:22.805
I haven't been with a man for a long time.

54:23.893 --> 54:25.246
Me neither.

54:25.413 --> 54:26.926
Be gentle.

54:39.333 --> 54:41.210
<i>Mamma mia.</i>

54:41.493 --> 54:43.131
Holy moly.

55:27.453 --> 55:29.002
Morning, Mr. Gustafson.

55:29.102 --> 55:30.526
I don't believe it.

55:31.573 --> 55:33.484
You and that beautiful lady?

55:33.813 --> 55:36.479
I am the thief of hearts.
I am the gangster of love.

55:36.579 --> 55:40.088
Tell me, was it more
of a holdup than a stickup?

55:40.413 --> 55:41.802
Never mind that.

55:41.902 --> 55:46.598
Even your infantile penis jokes seem
charming and witty this morning.

55:46.698 --> 55:50.288
Okay, Lothario, we got to get to
the Oktoberfest to meet the kids.

55:55.133 --> 55:58.170
I think I liked you better
before you were getting any.

56:17.173 --> 56:18.322
Hi, dear.

56:20.693 --> 56:21.880
What's going on?

56:21.980 --> 56:23.479
We got a surprise for you.

56:23.579 --> 56:25.079
No more surprises.

56:25.179 --> 56:26.765
Attention!

56:28.973 --> 56:31.203
In just eight days...

56:31.733 --> 56:36.204
these two happy kids
will be husband and wife!

56:40.493 --> 56:42.079
My dear friends...

56:42.179 --> 56:43.686
Max and John...

56:44.373 --> 56:45.965
have asked me...

56:46.213 --> 56:47.532
Handsome Hans...

56:47.973 --> 56:50.282
to be their music man!

56:53.373 --> 56:57.525
Let's celebrate the young lovers'
nuptials with the <i>Chicken Polka!</i>

57:04.253 --> 57:06.369
Come on, you're going to love this.

57:09.493 --> 57:11.245
I'm in the Twilight Zone.

57:13.093 --> 57:15.482
Another one of your father's great ideas.

57:15.733 --> 57:17.718
Your father booked our reception hall.

57:17.818 --> 57:20.719
Handsome Hans will fit right in
at Slippery's Bar.

57:20.819 --> 57:22.212
It's a tavern.

57:25.453 --> 57:26.677
This is a mistake.

57:26.777 --> 57:29.040
Right. We'll get a DJ. This is crazy.

57:29.140 --> 57:30.771
That's not what I meant.

57:36.773 --> 57:40.482
I want to get married.
If you're not sure, tell me.

57:41.173 --> 57:43.164
I'm just not sure.

57:44.733 --> 57:46.246
You tell me this now?

57:46.933 --> 57:48.562
We're a week away from the wedding.

57:48.662 --> 57:49.797
Jacob, I love you.

57:49.897 --> 57:51.319
You just don't want to marry me.

57:51.419 --> 57:52.637
No, that's not it!

57:52.737 --> 57:54.724
I think we should take our time.

57:55.053 --> 57:58.932
I've been taking my time. How does
waiting since the second grade grab you?

57:59.773 --> 58:01.286
Stop it!

58:04.573 --> 58:07.041
It's like you are already married.

58:10.653 --> 58:11.802
Polka!

58:14.013 --> 58:15.048
Honey.

58:18.133 --> 58:19.559
I know what I'm talking about.

58:19.659 --> 58:22.850
Really? Then how come you're
the one that's divorced?

58:34.773 --> 58:35.888
Honey?

58:36.133 --> 58:37.400
The wedding's off.

58:37.500 --> 58:38.637
What do you mean?

58:38.737 --> 58:41.037
We already paid for everything!

58:41.137 --> 58:42.197
Honey?

58:42.297 --> 58:43.487
What happened?

58:46.493 --> 58:48.643
What happened? I'll tell you.

58:48.973 --> 58:50.761
Your daughter got cold feet.

58:50.861 --> 58:53.120
My ass. Your son insulted her.

58:53.220 --> 58:56.561
Everything he said was true.
Maybe she can't handle the truth!

58:56.661 --> 58:58.761
She can't? What is the truth, Max?

58:58.861 --> 59:01.280
Her first marriage was a flop.

59:01.380 --> 59:03.321
That was Mike's fault. You know that.

59:03.421 --> 59:06.681
She couldn't keep Mike happy.
How can she keep Jacob happy?

59:06.781 --> 59:08.411
That's a lousy thing...

59:08.733 --> 59:12.437
My daughter wouldn't marry your son
if he was the last man in Wabasha.

59:12.537 --> 59:15.721
Fine with me. I was against
the whole thing from the start.

59:15.821 --> 59:17.037
That goes double for me.

59:17.137 --> 59:18.160
Then it's off!

59:18.260 --> 59:19.839
Everything is off!

59:19.939 --> 59:22.493
The wedding is off and
the friendship is off.

59:23.333 --> 59:25.642
And the gloves are off.

59:28.533 --> 59:30.444
Let the games begin.

59:31.173 --> 59:32.280
Come on, baby.

59:32.380 --> 59:33.567
Come to Papa.

59:35.253 --> 59:37.369
Yes, that a boy.

59:37.653 --> 59:39.166
That's it.

59:50.653 --> 59:52.564
What the hell is...

59:57.293 --> 59:59.682
Oh, damn you, Goldman!

01:00:09.853 --> 01:00:11.445
What a putz.

01:00:26.533 --> 01:00:27.886
Here's your card.

01:00:28.053 --> 01:00:30.123
- That's it for you?
- That'll do it.

01:00:30.933 --> 01:00:32.077
Have a nice day.

01:00:32.177 --> 01:00:33.811
Thanks. Same to you.

01:01:15.967 --> 01:01:17.446
You dance very well.

01:01:18.127 --> 01:01:19.321
Thank you.

01:01:21.807 --> 01:01:24.924
I got this for you. Hope you don't mind.

01:01:29.127 --> 01:01:30.958
It's a cubic zirconia.

01:01:31.407 --> 01:01:34.153
Got it from the Home Shopping Network.

01:01:34.253 --> 01:01:35.993
It's so beautiful.

01:01:36.093 --> 01:01:37.361
Let me help you.

01:01:39.407 --> 01:01:42.285
See how it looks? Just put that like that.

01:01:45.247 --> 01:01:46.885
You don't like it?

01:01:47.167 --> 01:01:49.471
No, it's beautiful. It's just...

01:01:49.571 --> 01:01:50.682
Just what?

01:01:51.087 --> 01:01:52.600
I don't know.

01:01:52.847 --> 01:01:54.758
Things are moving so fast.

01:01:54.927 --> 01:01:56.236
What's wrong with fast?

01:01:56.336 --> 01:01:57.551
I like fast.

01:01:57.651 --> 01:02:01.481
I didn't plan on meeting somebody
like you when I came to Wabasha.

01:02:02.287 --> 01:02:04.874
But you're happy, huh?

01:02:04.974 --> 01:02:07.322
Yes. But that is what worries me.

01:02:07.527 --> 01:02:08.751
What do you mean?

01:02:08.851 --> 01:02:10.997
I don't know what I'm talking about.

01:02:12.687 --> 01:02:13.881
It's beautiful.

01:02:14.927 --> 01:02:16.071
Thank you.

01:02:16.171 --> 01:02:17.520
Thank you, Max.

01:02:32.567 --> 01:02:35.127
Okay, Slick, sharpen those claws.

01:03:01.047 --> 01:03:02.446
Get out of there.

01:03:09.087 --> 01:03:10.600
Holy moly.

01:03:13.247 --> 01:03:14.274
You just...

01:03:14.374 --> 01:03:17.484
kissed your ninth life goodbye, Slick!

01:03:20.047 --> 01:03:22.038
This one is very sweet.

01:03:22.207 --> 01:03:25.244
That one, with the big tongue
and brown eyes, is great.

01:03:26.247 --> 01:03:27.391
This one?

01:03:27.491 --> 01:03:28.514
This one?

01:03:28.614 --> 01:03:29.960
Yes. One eye.

01:03:30.127 --> 01:03:31.122
No nuts.

01:03:31.222 --> 01:03:33.721
You mean Lucky. You don't want him.

01:03:34.647 --> 01:03:35.875
I'll take him.

01:03:36.167 --> 01:03:37.566
Here, Lucky.

01:03:41.247 --> 01:03:42.282
He's cute.

01:03:47.967 --> 01:03:50.435
Good morning, Slick.

01:03:50.847 --> 01:03:52.396
What a nice kitty cat.

01:03:52.496 --> 01:03:53.920
Yes, you are.

01:03:54.327 --> 01:03:57.478
And I see you've crapped
on my newspaper again.

01:03:58.327 --> 01:04:02.240
Would you like to make a
new friend this morning?

01:04:02.567 --> 01:04:03.562
Lucky!

01:04:03.662 --> 01:04:04.875
Kill Slick!

01:04:06.007 --> 01:04:07.151
Lucky!

01:04:07.251 --> 01:04:08.566
Kill Slick!

01:04:56.687 --> 01:04:58.439
Everything's under control.

01:05:02.687 --> 01:05:04.635
How do you like that, you putz?

01:05:04.735 --> 01:05:06.160
Why you dirty...

01:05:10.087 --> 01:05:11.151
I'll kill you.

01:05:11.251 --> 01:05:13.754
You ruined my refinished seats.

01:05:13.854 --> 01:05:17.275
You broadcast my naked
ass to half of Wabasha!

01:05:17.375 --> 01:05:19.917
Big deal! Take that, you vandal!

01:05:20.017 --> 01:05:21.476
You nearly killed my cat!

01:05:21.576 --> 01:05:25.321
That mangy animal's been
crapping on my paper for years!

01:05:27.407 --> 01:05:28.920
Give me that pole!

01:05:29.287 --> 01:05:30.959
That pole?

01:05:39.327 --> 01:05:40.555
That's it.

01:05:41.207 --> 01:05:43.394
If my dog was as ugly as you...

01:05:43.494 --> 01:05:46.763
I'd shave his ass and
teach him to walk backwards!

01:05:50.047 --> 01:05:51.995
That trick doesn't work with me.

01:05:52.095 --> 01:05:54.637
Time out. Where are you going?

01:05:54.737 --> 01:05:58.322
Home. You can call me when
this stupid war is over!

01:05:59.047 --> 01:06:00.480
She left me.

01:06:01.007 --> 01:06:02.486
Are you surprised?

01:06:09.647 --> 01:06:10.647
<i>There we are.</i>

01:06:11.567 --> 01:06:13.917
<i>So good.</i>

01:06:14.017 --> 01:06:14.742
<i>Now...</i>

01:06:14.842 --> 01:06:15.886
<i>you put in...</i>

01:06:16.207 --> 01:06:18.038
<i>just a pinch of salt.</i>

01:06:18.847 --> 01:06:19.847
Damn.

01:06:20.087 --> 01:06:21.151
<i>Not too much.</i>

01:06:21.251 --> 01:06:22.999
Now you tell me.

01:06:23.487 --> 01:06:24.796
<i>Not too salty.</i>

01:06:24.896 --> 01:06:25.886
Shut up.

01:06:25.986 --> 01:06:28.117
<i>There we are. Add some garnish here.</i>

01:06:28.927 --> 01:06:30.593
<i>Time to look at the birds.</i>

01:06:30.693 --> 01:06:32.359
The bird.

01:06:33.087 --> 01:06:34.087
Fire!

01:06:37.007 --> 01:06:38.007
Fire!

01:06:38.207 --> 01:06:39.959
I got a fire here!

01:06:41.887 --> 01:06:46.642
<i>Absolutely perfect. Anybody</i>
<i>can make these. It's simple.</i>

01:06:47.447 --> 01:06:48.836
What're you doing?

01:06:48.936 --> 01:06:51.072
I'm trying to cook a gourmet dinner...

01:06:51.172 --> 01:06:52.566
for Maria.

01:06:56.287 --> 01:06:58.953
- Look at this.
- She'll be impressed.

01:06:59.053 --> 01:07:00.560
Tell her it's Cajun.

01:07:02.247 --> 01:07:04.044
And what do you call this?

01:07:04.367 --> 01:07:05.554
Haven't decided.

01:07:05.654 --> 01:07:08.207
But I'm leaning toward "Mystery Stew."

01:07:08.447 --> 01:07:09.721
Is that right?

01:07:10.407 --> 01:07:12.957
Not to be a pessimist,
but maybe you need a backup plan.

01:07:13.057 --> 01:07:14.685
What else can you make?

01:07:14.887 --> 01:07:16.878
- Jelly sandwiches.
- Get cracking.

01:07:17.127 --> 01:07:19.916
I used to love jelly
sandwiches with peanut butter.

01:07:20.016 --> 01:07:21.998
So did you, when you were a kid.

01:07:26.367 --> 01:07:28.432
Go over and tell her you're sorry.

01:07:28.532 --> 01:07:32.202
I tried to. She won't even talk to me.
Not that I blame her.

01:07:37.407 --> 01:07:40.956
You spend too much time
with this Max Goldman.

01:07:41.247 --> 01:07:43.363
I like him, Mama. A lot.

01:07:43.487 --> 01:07:45.914
He'll break your heart, like the others.

01:07:46.014 --> 01:07:48.391
No, this time it's different.

01:07:48.491 --> 01:07:51.595
You said Fernando was different,
and look what happened.

01:07:51.695 --> 01:07:53.475
I was a girl, Mama!

01:07:53.575 --> 01:07:56.604
And then there was Eduardo, the drunk.

01:07:56.887 --> 01:07:58.559
That was a long time ago.

01:07:58.767 --> 01:08:01.795
Marcello, the womanizer,
was not that long ago.

01:08:01.895 --> 01:08:02.994
I'm not listening.

01:08:03.094 --> 01:08:05.716
And next came Carlo, the con man.

01:08:05.816 --> 01:08:07.675
- Are you finished?
- I wish!

01:08:07.775 --> 01:08:10.201
But then I would be forgetting Antonio!

01:08:11.447 --> 01:08:14.193
All five I warn you against...

01:08:14.293 --> 01:08:17.715
and all five you marry!

01:08:17.814 --> 01:08:19.684
You are a good girl...

01:08:19.886 --> 01:08:21.792
but you are cursed in love.

01:08:21.892 --> 01:08:23.206
That isn't true.

01:08:23.327 --> 01:08:25.841
For once, Maria, listen to your mama.

01:08:27.846 --> 01:08:29.837
Do you care for him?

01:08:31.407 --> 01:08:32.407
Yes.

01:08:33.727 --> 01:08:35.479
Then leave him be.

01:09:54.487 --> 01:09:57.595
I've really done it this time.
I've really screwed up.

01:09:57.695 --> 01:10:00.247
Jake and Melanie
have called off the marriage.

01:10:00.407 --> 01:10:03.797
Jake moved in with Max, Max
and I are at it again and...

01:10:04.767 --> 01:10:09.045
Ariel's moved back into her house
with Melanie. What am I going to do?

01:10:38.207 --> 01:10:40.516
Looks like God remembered you.

01:11:43.927 --> 01:11:45.326
I'm sorry.

01:12:16.167 --> 01:12:17.354
Hey, moron.

01:12:17.454 --> 01:12:18.880
Hello, putz.

01:12:19.887 --> 01:12:21.276
Mind if I join you?

01:12:21.376 --> 01:12:22.766
No, help yourself.

01:12:26.127 --> 01:12:28.960
I knew your old man longer
than I knew my own.

01:12:30.767 --> 01:12:32.672
He was always fond of you.

01:12:32.772 --> 01:12:34.120
He was a good man.

01:12:34.367 --> 01:12:35.516
The best.

01:12:36.207 --> 01:12:39.882
You know I didn't mean
what I said about Melanie the other day.

01:12:40.047 --> 01:12:42.436
You know how I really feel about Jacob.

01:12:43.487 --> 01:12:44.966
He's a good boy.

01:12:46.447 --> 01:12:48.722
I just don't want him to be lonely.

01:12:49.007 --> 01:12:50.440
He deserves better.

01:12:50.647 --> 01:12:52.080
He deserves Melanie.

01:12:58.767 --> 01:13:00.564
What do you want to do?

01:13:02.567 --> 01:13:03.711
Wanna get drunk?

01:13:03.811 --> 01:13:04.811
Yeah.

01:13:21.607 --> 01:13:23.512
Come on, Grandpa John, hurry.

01:13:23.612 --> 01:13:27.274
I'm coming. But you already
got enough candy in this bag...

01:13:27.374 --> 01:13:29.235
to give the neighborhood cavities.

01:13:29.335 --> 01:13:32.792
<i>What'll you do to ensure six months</i>
<i>from now you feel happier...</i>

01:13:32.892 --> 01:13:34.957
<i>and more loved than you do today?</i>

01:13:36.007 --> 01:13:38.557
<i>The truth is, if you don't do something...</i>

01:13:38.657 --> 01:13:40.478
<i>nothing in life will change.</i>

01:13:49.087 --> 01:13:51.396
<i>Stop the insanity!</i>

01:14:17.487 --> 01:14:18.993
What are you feeding him?

01:14:19.093 --> 01:14:20.566
Hormel chili.

01:14:22.807 --> 01:14:24.286
He likes it.

01:14:26.167 --> 01:14:27.520
Trick or treat.

01:14:28.167 --> 01:14:31.955
Trick or treat, I forgot. Just plain forgot.

01:14:32.927 --> 01:14:34.433
Hiya, kids.

01:14:34.533 --> 01:14:35.634
Here's your coaster.

01:14:35.734 --> 01:14:37.276
And there's a stapler for you.

01:14:37.376 --> 01:14:39.597
Open your bag. That's it. Good shot.

01:14:39.807 --> 01:14:41.126
Happy Halloween.

01:14:42.007 --> 01:14:43.274
Hi, Uncle Max.

01:14:43.374 --> 01:14:44.554
Who's that? Allie?

01:14:44.654 --> 01:14:45.645
Hi, Allie.

01:14:45.745 --> 01:14:48.161
Is Allie here? Look at you.

01:14:48.367 --> 01:14:50.756
Let me hear a polar bear growl.

01:14:53.727 --> 01:14:55.877
Happy Halloween there, putzo.

01:14:56.567 --> 01:14:57.876
How'd you know it's me?

01:14:57.976 --> 01:15:01.960
You wear the same costume every
Christmas or whatever this...

01:15:02.607 --> 01:15:03.676
Halloween.

01:15:05.327 --> 01:15:07.363
Hey, you. How's your mom doing?

01:15:07.567 --> 01:15:09.205
Okay. Want to come over?

01:15:09.367 --> 01:15:12.006
Yeah, you want to go over and just say hi?

01:15:13.327 --> 01:15:16.285
She'd probably throw me
out the moment she saw me.

01:15:21.927 --> 01:15:24.157
Max, I think I got an idea.

01:15:29.207 --> 01:15:30.234
Trick or treat!

01:15:30.334 --> 01:15:31.646
Hey, you!

01:15:33.807 --> 01:15:35.074
How did we do tonight?

01:15:35.174 --> 01:15:38.762
Uncle Max gave me a can opener
and a bunch of laundry detergent.

01:15:39.247 --> 01:15:40.647
He did?

01:15:42.407 --> 01:15:43.760
Yes, he did.

01:15:47.287 --> 01:15:48.845
I'm going to bed.

01:15:48.967 --> 01:15:51.401
Don't you want to watch the scary movie?

01:15:51.527 --> 01:15:54.644
I said, I'm going to bed!

01:15:55.687 --> 01:15:57.439
What has gotten into her?

01:16:03.527 --> 01:16:04.801
You look great.

01:16:08.567 --> 01:16:10.558
You look ridiculous.

01:16:16.367 --> 01:16:18.244
Needed to see you again...

01:16:21.447 --> 01:16:24.316
to tell you how sorry
I was for the way I acted.

01:16:24.416 --> 01:16:28.116
I just thought I couldn't be
happy unless we were married...

01:16:28.647 --> 01:16:30.126
and I realize now...

01:16:31.647 --> 01:16:33.717
I just want you in my life.

01:16:34.687 --> 01:16:36.166
That's all I want.

01:16:37.567 --> 01:16:39.558
And if we ever do get married...

01:16:40.367 --> 01:16:41.641
I promise...

01:16:43.447 --> 01:16:46.166
we'll use a professional
wedding coordinator.

01:16:50.527 --> 01:16:52.245
You look terrific.

01:17:03.847 --> 01:17:05.193
They're watching us.

01:17:05.293 --> 01:17:06.394
No, they're not.

01:17:06.494 --> 01:17:09.001
No, they're not. Yes, they are.

01:17:16.607 --> 01:17:18.518
Let's celebrate. Beers are on me.

01:17:18.687 --> 01:17:22.282
I'd love to, but I've got someone
very special waiting for me.

01:17:24.887 --> 01:17:27.793
If you had half a brain, you
could have the same thing.

01:17:27.893 --> 01:17:29.320
She dumped me.

01:17:30.527 --> 01:17:34.520
Would you park that stupid
pride of yours just once?

01:17:35.807 --> 01:17:38.037
You might surprise yourself.

01:17:47.527 --> 01:17:49.324
I must speak to Maria!

01:17:52.887 --> 01:17:54.276
Put down that bat.

01:17:54.376 --> 01:17:55.996
She don't want to see you.

01:17:56.096 --> 01:17:58.965
I ain't leaving here until I see Maria!

01:17:59.487 --> 01:18:00.602
At last...

01:18:00.767 --> 01:18:02.564
I get to whack him!

01:18:03.087 --> 01:18:04.998
Mama, please. Please.

01:18:09.887 --> 01:18:11.878
Maria, we need to talk.

01:18:12.887 --> 01:18:14.436
There's nothing to talk about.

01:18:14.536 --> 01:18:19.123
At least give me an explanation.
I think I deserve that much.

01:18:20.047 --> 01:18:21.446
Yes, you're right.

01:18:23.807 --> 01:18:25.525
I must tell you something.

01:18:27.647 --> 01:18:29.399
I have been married before.

01:18:30.047 --> 01:18:32.117
To Antonio, I know.

01:18:32.727 --> 01:18:34.524
But also to Fernando.

01:18:35.367 --> 01:18:36.516
And Carlo.

01:18:37.727 --> 01:18:39.285
And Eduardo.

01:18:40.687 --> 01:18:42.279
And Marcello.

01:18:48.607 --> 01:18:50.040
Holy moly.

01:18:51.167 --> 01:18:53.476
You've been married five times?

01:18:54.207 --> 01:18:55.879
So, now you understand?

01:18:56.767 --> 01:18:58.280
Mother is right.

01:18:59.167 --> 01:19:01.237
I'm cursed in love.

01:19:05.567 --> 01:19:07.080
Wait! Wait!

01:19:07.567 --> 01:19:09.398
Will you wait, please?

01:19:13.367 --> 01:19:16.439
I don't know what happened
with those other guys, but...

01:19:16.647 --> 01:19:18.763
let me tell you something about me.

01:19:22.807 --> 01:19:25.560
I know I'm no great prize, but I'm loyal...

01:19:26.247 --> 01:19:27.521
I'm honest...

01:19:27.847 --> 01:19:30.486
and I know how to treat a lady.

01:19:32.607 --> 01:19:36.043
Anybody says any different doesn't
know her ass from her elbow.

01:19:39.487 --> 01:19:43.314
Look, I got a week's worth
of leftovers at the house...

01:19:43.414 --> 01:19:48.162
so if you care to join me for some
Mystery Stew and jelly sandwiches...

01:19:48.567 --> 01:19:50.876
I would be indeed honored.

01:19:53.447 --> 01:19:55.403
That sounds wonderful.

01:19:59.047 --> 01:20:02.005
You must really like jelly sandwiches.

01:20:21.607 --> 01:20:23.325
<i>TrÃ¨s magnifique,</i> Max.

01:20:23.967 --> 01:20:25.082
Thank you.

01:20:25.487 --> 01:20:27.275
We're running a bit behind.

01:20:27.375 --> 01:20:28.800
Meet you at church.

01:20:28.967 --> 01:20:30.195
Don't be late!

01:20:41.647 --> 01:20:43.399
Isn't that Sven over there?

01:20:59.567 --> 01:21:01.472
You look like you've seen a ghost.

01:21:01.572 --> 01:21:03.956
Biggest fish I ever seen.

01:21:04.647 --> 01:21:06.319
Catfish Hunter, yeah.

01:21:09.087 --> 01:21:10.311
I fought the beast...

01:21:10.411 --> 01:21:11.551
for an hour...

01:21:11.651 --> 01:21:13.000
and I had him.

01:21:13.167 --> 01:21:15.232
Right up into the boat.

01:21:15.332 --> 01:21:16.521
And then...

01:21:17.887 --> 01:21:19.031
he smiled.

01:21:19.131 --> 01:21:20.436
- Smiled?
- See?

01:21:20.536 --> 01:21:21.873
He bit the pole in half.

01:21:21.973 --> 01:21:23.559
Holy moly.

01:21:23.887 --> 01:21:26.596
I moved my hand at the last moment.

01:21:26.696 --> 01:21:27.836
Judas Priest.

01:21:29.327 --> 01:21:30.646
That was the...

01:21:31.127 --> 01:21:33.561
biggest damn fish that...

01:21:34.687 --> 01:21:35.881
I ever seen.

01:21:40.207 --> 01:21:42.243
Don't even think of it.

01:21:42.407 --> 01:21:45.558
My boat is beached not more
than 100 yards from here.

01:21:45.727 --> 01:21:50.323
We'll give it 10 minutes. After that,
we pull anchor, go to the church.

01:21:50.927 --> 01:21:53.316
What if today is the day,
and we miss him?

01:21:53.767 --> 01:21:55.433
Someone else could catch him...

01:21:55.533 --> 01:21:58.360
some stranger with our fish
mounted on his wall.

01:21:59.207 --> 01:22:01.721
It's too horrible to think about.

01:22:25.327 --> 01:22:26.673
Let's go.

01:22:26.773 --> 01:22:29.795
What do you mean?
We've still got more time.

01:22:29.895 --> 01:22:32.953
That fish'll be halfway to
Red Wing by now. Let's go.

01:22:33.053 --> 01:22:34.111
Five more minutes.

01:22:34.211 --> 01:22:35.204
We'll be late!

01:22:35.304 --> 01:22:39.326
Weddings never start on time!
What's wrong? Why are you worried?

01:22:43.327 --> 01:22:44.594
I'm going.

01:22:44.694 --> 01:22:47.274
You must swim back. Where're you going?

01:22:47.374 --> 01:22:49.155
Don't touch my motor!

01:22:49.255 --> 01:22:53.001
Will you sit down, John,
for crying out loud!

01:22:53.127 --> 01:22:54.480
Five more minutes!

01:22:54.607 --> 01:22:56.395
Sit down and shut up.

01:22:56.495 --> 01:22:58.000
- Moron.
- Putz.

01:23:00.047 --> 01:23:02.163
Holy Jesus, Max.

01:23:04.327 --> 01:23:05.601
Look, look.

01:23:10.607 --> 01:23:11.881
Easy, easy.

01:23:15.727 --> 01:23:16.921
Don't worry.

01:23:21.487 --> 01:23:22.840
Look at him go.

01:23:24.887 --> 01:23:26.525
Now he'll stop.

01:23:27.447 --> 01:23:28.511
And now...

01:23:28.611 --> 01:23:29.926
I'm going to...

01:23:32.207 --> 01:23:34.516
That's Catfish Hunter. It's got to be.

01:23:37.447 --> 01:23:39.076
I think I pissed him off!

01:23:39.176 --> 01:23:42.204
Hang on, Max, I think
we're going for a ride.

01:23:53.607 --> 01:23:54.634
Hang on.

01:23:54.734 --> 01:23:56.604
I can't believe it's a fish.

01:23:57.007 --> 01:23:58.476
Maybe it's not a fish!

01:23:58.576 --> 01:24:01.400
Maybe it's something from outer space!

01:24:01.847 --> 01:24:02.991
Keep the tip up!

01:24:03.091 --> 01:24:05.157
- The tip is up.
- Tighten the drag!

01:24:06.287 --> 01:24:09.324
He better be dead. That's
the only excuse I'll accept.

01:24:09.767 --> 01:24:10.762
Work him!

01:24:10.862 --> 01:24:12.396
I'm working him, dummy.

01:24:12.496 --> 01:24:15.313
Pump him! Tip up!

01:24:15.413 --> 01:24:17.125
The tip is up, you idiot!

01:24:17.527 --> 01:24:21.042
You're right, it's not an important day.
No reason to be here.

01:24:21.367 --> 01:24:22.595
Hang on.

01:24:26.047 --> 01:24:27.154
Drop the anchor.

01:24:27.254 --> 01:24:28.913
You cut the anchor, putz!

01:24:29.013 --> 01:24:30.636
Then grab the net.

01:24:30.736 --> 01:24:34.032
You cut the net, too, you dickhead.
Here. Look.

01:24:34.132 --> 01:24:36.836
Forget the net!
Just give me a hand, will you?

01:24:36.936 --> 01:24:40.355
The only thing you ever caught
in your life was a virus.

01:24:40.455 --> 01:24:42.352
Put your gloves on.

01:24:42.452 --> 01:24:45.723
I'll show you how to do it.
Here's the way you do it.

01:24:46.047 --> 01:24:47.241
Now, watch.

01:24:49.087 --> 01:24:50.406
Grab him!

01:24:52.807 --> 01:24:54.445
Crime in Italy.

01:24:57.127 --> 01:24:59.235
Holy moly! My God!

01:24:59.335 --> 01:25:00.594
Look at this thing.

01:25:00.694 --> 01:25:02.316
Holy moly!

01:25:02.416 --> 01:25:03.965
Get his tail.

01:25:04.127 --> 01:25:05.394
I got it.

01:25:05.494 --> 01:25:06.494
Now!

01:25:22.087 --> 01:25:24.999
Is that the most beautiful
thing you've ever seen?

01:25:25.327 --> 01:25:27.238
If I die today...

01:25:27.607 --> 01:25:29.432
I die a happy man.

01:25:29.532 --> 01:25:31.757
You die today, I'm taking your motor.

01:25:42.527 --> 01:25:44.040
Let's let him go.

01:25:44.727 --> 01:25:46.712
Are you out of your mind?

01:25:46.812 --> 01:25:49.873
Dad tried to catch that fish for 20 years.

01:25:49.973 --> 01:25:52.845
Catfish Hunter deserves to
be in the lake with Pop.

01:25:55.727 --> 01:25:58.685
Gustafson, you are one sick bastard.

01:25:59.967 --> 01:26:01.480
Good boy.

01:26:06.407 --> 01:26:08.637
Goodbye, Catfish.

01:26:22.527 --> 01:26:23.836
The wedding!

01:26:23.936 --> 01:26:25.201
What time is it?

01:26:30.487 --> 01:26:32.159
We got another wedding at 3:00.

01:26:32.287 --> 01:26:34.403
We'll make it by then. 3:00?

01:26:40.207 --> 01:26:41.640
Don't sing that.

01:26:44.767 --> 01:26:46.086
Move it!

01:26:47.407 --> 01:26:48.920
What're you doing?

01:26:53.487 --> 01:26:55.312
Okay, just a little bit longer.

01:26:55.412 --> 01:26:57.116
- Just a bit longer.
- I'm done.

01:26:57.216 --> 01:27:00.352
I've played, now. How long have I played?

01:27:00.452 --> 01:27:02.831
Stay here. Just keep playing.

01:27:02.931 --> 01:27:04.883
I'll play one more time.

01:27:10.647 --> 01:27:11.875
Wedding!

01:27:37.527 --> 01:27:38.671
We're here!

01:27:38.771 --> 01:27:39.771
Wait!

01:27:41.727 --> 01:27:43.080
We're here!

01:27:44.287 --> 01:27:45.633
Wait, we're here!

01:27:45.733 --> 01:27:47.046
We're here!

01:27:47.407 --> 01:27:48.674
Why the boots?

01:27:48.774 --> 01:27:50.156
I'll explain later.

01:27:50.256 --> 01:27:53.637
Explain now. Where have you been?
I've held this up for hours.

01:28:11.367 --> 01:28:12.676
See what we missed?

01:28:12.776 --> 01:28:14.485
Thank God we eloped.

01:28:41.607 --> 01:28:43.006
You got the ring?

01:29:04.367 --> 01:29:07.723
My son-in-law has got
the face of a mackerel.

01:29:11.167 --> 01:29:12.167
Ox.

01:29:12.607 --> 01:29:13.607
Nag.

01:29:14.287 --> 01:29:15.836
We are gathered here today...

01:29:15.936 --> 01:29:17.795
to join Maxwell Goldman...

01:29:17.895 --> 01:29:20.553
and Maria Sophia Coletta Ragetti...

01:29:20.653 --> 01:29:22.000
in holy matrimony.

01:29:38.607 --> 01:29:40.316
Be sure to watch Lucky for us.

01:29:40.416 --> 01:29:42.711
I'll miss that ugly mug of his.

01:29:42.811 --> 01:29:45.357
Don't worry, you'll see
him before you know it.

01:29:45.457 --> 01:29:47.272
I'll miss your ugly mug, too.

01:29:47.372 --> 01:29:49.039
God bless you, sir.

01:29:49.527 --> 01:29:51.358
Let go of my hand. I'm busy.

01:30:20.647 --> 01:30:22.196
What's that smell?

01:30:22.296 --> 01:30:23.686
What smell?

01:30:35.727 --> 01:30:37.319
What a moron.

01:30:51.247 --> 01:30:53.631
What do you say we go back to my place...

01:30:53.731 --> 01:30:58.198
and I'll show you
my spicy, peppy pepperoni?

01:30:59.207 --> 01:31:01.960
What do you say we go
back to my house...

01:31:02.407 --> 01:31:06.639
and I'll show you my man-sized manicotti?

01:31:07.167 --> 01:31:08.231
Beautiful.

01:31:08.331 --> 01:31:09.993
I'm the gangster of love.

01:31:10.093 --> 01:31:12.999
I am the Lothario of hearts.

01:31:14.207 --> 01:31:15.431
I don't know where I am.

01:31:15.531 --> 01:31:17.119
Get in the car, Max.

01:31:17.727 --> 01:31:20.605
I can't. I farted and I'm afraid to move.

01:31:22.967 --> 01:31:24.633
What the hell is her name?

01:31:24.733 --> 01:31:25.842
Ariel?

01:31:26.127 --> 01:31:27.596
What's her name again?

01:31:27.696 --> 01:31:28.756
Maria.

01:31:29.407 --> 01:31:30.681
She left me.

01:31:30.807 --> 01:31:34.117
You're surprised?
You don't even know her name.

01:31:36.967 --> 01:31:38.400
Hey, dickhead!

01:31:38.567 --> 01:31:39.636
I'm stuck.

01:31:41.647 --> 01:31:43.116
I've been to Hawaii.

01:31:43.216 --> 01:31:44.474
Which island?

01:31:44.574 --> 01:31:46.603
L-kinda-like-to-poke-you.

01:31:46.967 --> 01:31:48.436
You-like-a-licky-dicky.

01:31:48.536 --> 01:31:50.245
I'm-a-kinda-kinky.

01:31:50.367 --> 01:31:51.713
Want-a-peek-a-pee-pee?

01:31:51.813 --> 01:31:54.879
Some stranger could catch our fish.

01:31:55.207 --> 01:31:57.511
Some schmuck with his fish...

01:31:57.611 --> 01:32:00.963
and my fish and your
fish up on the... wall...

01:32:05.927 --> 01:32:07.838
Get another actor. Please.

01:32:08.007 --> 01:32:10.965
She's nothing but a
pigheaded Italian with...

01:32:13.047 --> 01:32:15.916
Go one more from the top, and a
little bit more out of breath.

01:32:16.016 --> 01:32:18.152
If I was more out of breath, I'd be dead.

01:32:18.252 --> 01:32:19.753
You're still a putz.

01:32:19.853 --> 01:32:21.075
That's my line!

01:32:21.207 --> 01:32:23.721
You will never even know it's there.

01:32:26.807 --> 01:32:27.956
I love you.

01:32:32.247 --> 01:32:33.600
He's a criminal.

01:32:37.087 --> 01:32:38.645
Should the veil be up?

01:32:43.327 --> 01:32:44.327
Ox!

01:32:44.447 --> 01:32:45.953
Jesus Christ!

01:32:46.053 --> 01:32:48.845
Why the... don't you
look where you're going?

01:32:49.567 --> 01:32:54.436
Why don't you come to my place?
I'll show you my beefy bologna.

01:32:56.607 --> 01:32:59.644
How would you like my bony macaroni?

01:33:00.167 --> 01:33:02.237
Or my fatty Alfredo?

01:33:02.367 --> 01:33:05.837
Or my hard salami? I got them all.
