WEBVTT

00:01.323 --> 00:03.673
It's alright.

00:05.545 --> 00:06.981
Morgan sent me.

00:07.112 --> 00:08.896
I'm supposed to turn off
the beacon on the roof tonight.

00:09.027 --> 00:11.507
Clear out the walkers so they
can get Grace and the baby out.

00:11.638 --> 00:13.683
There's only one way things
are gonna change,

00:13.814 --> 00:15.816
and that's if I can
get in Strand's ear.

00:15.946 --> 00:18.297
He needs me. More than
he needs you.

00:18.427 --> 00:20.516
Charlie stays with me,
under my care.

00:20.647 --> 00:22.736
That's the deal.

00:22.866 --> 00:25.521
I need to talk to Victor.
Tell him I want to make a deal.

00:25.652 --> 00:27.175
Why would he want to
make a deal with you?

00:27.306 --> 00:28.829
Because I can help
save his Tower.

00:41.581 --> 00:43.365
Victor, we need to talk.

00:43.496 --> 00:45.541
And I'll be straight with you.

00:45.672 --> 00:48.240
I've got some concerns about
how you're running this place.

00:56.683 --> 01:00.121
If there's one thing I know
from my days as a cop,

01:00.252 --> 01:02.254
you're only as good
as your partner.

01:17.704 --> 01:19.227
I think you deserve a partner

01:19.358 --> 01:21.055
to help remind you
which way is up.

01:21.186 --> 01:24.928
No! No!

01:25.059 --> 01:28.715
No!
Please, please.

01:28.845 --> 01:31.935
I didn't do anything.

01:32.066 --> 01:34.199
We found a walkie
in your mattress.

01:34.329 --> 01:36.766
But that doesn't mean --

01:42.946 --> 01:45.601
You built this place
using your instincts.

01:54.219 --> 01:55.959
Well, I've got
a few of my own.

01:56.090 --> 01:57.309
I'm willing
to share them

01:57.439 --> 02:00.355
if you're willing
to listen.

02:00.486 --> 02:01.574
Well?

02:01.704 --> 02:03.184
It's never
gonna work, John.

02:03.315 --> 02:05.012
Why not?

02:05.143 --> 02:07.797
Because the only voice Victor
Strand listens to is his own.

02:07.928 --> 02:10.409
And he has a yes-man like Howard
who won't question him.

02:10.539 --> 02:12.585
That's exactly
why he likes him.

02:12.715 --> 02:14.891
Well, what he likes
and what he needs

02:15.022 --> 02:15.979
are two
different things.

02:16.110 --> 02:18.156
What does that mean,
John?

02:19.940 --> 02:21.985
Things are starting
to go sideways here.

02:22.116 --> 02:24.074
He's paranoid.

02:24.205 --> 02:26.599
Every since Morgan poisoned him,
he's got it in his head

02:26.729 --> 02:28.775
that there's some kind
of resistance inside the Tower.

02:28.905 --> 02:31.647
That's why he's cracking down
on walkies.

02:31.778 --> 02:33.301
June?

02:35.390 --> 02:37.087
I'll be right in.

02:41.135 --> 02:42.832
Her skin,
are those --?

02:42.963 --> 02:45.226
It's radiation burns.

02:45.357 --> 02:46.619
How's she doing?

02:48.795 --> 02:50.100
Nothing can be done?

02:50.231 --> 02:52.320
Not with
her level of exposure.

02:56.846 --> 02:58.326
All I can do
is keep her comfortable

02:58.457 --> 03:01.024
for whatever time
she has left.

03:01.155 --> 03:03.462
I should go,
John.

03:03.592 --> 03:04.811
What happened
to Charlie

03:04.941 --> 03:07.248
doesn't have to happen
to anyone else.

03:07.379 --> 03:08.902
I can get through
to Strand.

03:09.032 --> 03:11.078
I just need
the right opportunity.

03:13.036 --> 03:15.996
You think
you can change Victor?

03:16.126 --> 03:19.260
What makes you think
Victorwon't change you?That's not gonna happen.

03:19.391 --> 03:22.176
That's exactly what happened
to your son.

03:22.307 --> 03:24.004
He was trying to beat Ginny
at her own game,

03:24.134 --> 03:26.746
and it destroyed him.

03:26.876 --> 03:28.835
Don't make
that same mistake.

03:31.446 --> 03:33.405
Anything in here?

03:33.535 --> 03:34.928
It's clean.

03:35.058 --> 03:36.495
We found
another walkie.

03:36.625 --> 03:37.844
Where?

03:37.974 --> 03:39.498
Who had one?

03:39.628 --> 03:41.978
Howard.

03:48.333 --> 03:50.552
What?

03:50.683 --> 03:52.859
I told you
I needed the right opportunity

03:52.989 --> 03:55.296
to get to Strand.

03:55.427 --> 03:57.429
I think
I just found it.

04:11.007 --> 04:12.444
Come in.

04:18.450 --> 04:21.453
What can I do
for you, John?

04:21.583 --> 04:23.977
I'll be straight
with you, Victor.

04:24.107 --> 04:26.893
I've got some concerns about
how you're running this place.

04:48.480 --> 04:50.612
No!
No, wait!

04:50.743 --> 04:53.006
It wasn't mine,
I swear!

04:53.136 --> 04:55.400
And yet it was found
in your room!

04:55.530 --> 04:57.358
Victor,
you know me!
Do I?

04:57.489 --> 04:59.447
I've been by your side
since the beginning.

04:59.578 --> 05:00.796
Why would I
throw that all away?

05:00.927 --> 05:02.494
Your family,
your son.

05:02.624 --> 05:05.018
Perhaps you've joined the chorus
of dissenters from within.

05:05.148 --> 05:07.194
No, this place
is everything to me.

05:07.325 --> 05:08.369
You know the rules,
Howard.

05:08.500 --> 05:10.806
I didn't do this!

05:10.937 --> 05:14.157
I need people I can trust,
now more than ever.

05:14.288 --> 05:16.159
You no longer fit
that description, old friend.

05:16.290 --> 05:19.206
Wait, no!
Victor, please!

05:19.337 --> 05:22.557
Someone planted the walkie
so you'd doubt me.

05:31.349 --> 05:33.612
It worked.

05:33.742 --> 05:35.265
Regardless of
how it got there,

05:35.396 --> 05:38.356
I can't believe a word you say
until I have proof.

05:41.489 --> 05:43.796
And you're
gonna get it for me.

05:47.321 --> 05:49.541
Answer it.

05:52.979 --> 05:54.763
Yeah?

05:54.894 --> 05:56.809
When?

05:56.939 --> 05:58.593
Are you sure?

06:02.336 --> 06:04.599
We got a problem.

06:06.384 --> 06:07.689
What do you mean,
she's missing?

06:07.820 --> 06:09.691
Infants don't just vanish
into thin air.

06:09.822 --> 06:12.215
She wasn't in her crib
when I came to check on her.

06:12.346 --> 06:14.435
I'll find her.

06:14.566 --> 06:16.437
Victor, please,
let me do this.

06:16.568 --> 06:19.527
I told you,
I don't trust you.

06:19.658 --> 06:22.138
Then let me show you
you still can.

06:22.269 --> 06:24.880
Put whatever rangers
you want on me,

06:25.011 --> 06:26.708
make sure
I'm not hiding anything.

06:31.452 --> 06:33.759
Retrieve her by sunrise

06:33.889 --> 06:36.283
or I'll finish
what we started on the roof.

06:38.981 --> 06:40.853
I will find her.

06:44.987 --> 06:47.163
John, a word.

06:47.294 --> 06:49.688
I'd like for you
to find that baby.

06:49.818 --> 06:52.386
But you
just told Howard --Howard may be stalling.

06:52.517 --> 06:54.823
As such, I'd rather
hedge my bets.

06:54.954 --> 06:56.259
You're betting
on me?

06:56.390 --> 06:59.393
I've seen the Dorie spirit
in action.

06:59.524 --> 07:02.178
I once saw your son build a raft
from a broke-down truck

07:02.309 --> 07:04.485
just to get back
to June.

07:04.616 --> 07:06.182
He cared
about the right things.

07:06.313 --> 07:08.141
As do you.

07:08.271 --> 07:09.925
Which is,
I assume,

07:10.056 --> 07:11.971
why you came to me
and spoke of your desire

07:12.101 --> 07:15.148
to recalibrate
things here.

07:15.278 --> 07:16.845
Too many people
are getting hurt

07:16.976 --> 07:19.718
that don't need to.

07:19.848 --> 07:22.721
This Tower is bigger
than the both of us.

07:22.851 --> 07:24.549
It is my future.

07:24.679 --> 07:26.420
It is the way
I'll be remembered,

07:26.551 --> 07:27.943
my legacy.

07:28.074 --> 07:29.510
That may well be,

07:29.641 --> 07:31.904
but take it from me,
Victor --

07:32.034 --> 07:35.690
legacy can slip away
if you're not careful.

07:39.215 --> 07:40.695
How so?

07:40.826 --> 07:42.175
Well, let's just say
I know what it's like

07:42.305 --> 07:45.352
to do the wrong thing
for the right reason.

07:45.483 --> 07:47.093
It doesn't end well.

07:50.270 --> 07:51.967
I'm willing to listen.

07:52.098 --> 07:55.536
But first, I need to know
that you can deliver.

07:55.667 --> 07:56.581
Succeeding
where Howard fails

07:56.711 --> 07:59.148
will do wonders
for your prospects here.

08:02.064 --> 08:03.892
Good luck, John.

08:08.723 --> 08:10.333
I don't know anything.

08:10.464 --> 08:12.205
You're Mo's nanny.

08:12.335 --> 08:14.033
She's your responsibility.

08:14.163 --> 08:16.557
John,
what is this?

08:16.688 --> 08:18.733
If I knew where she was,
I'd tell you.

08:18.864 --> 08:20.692
I didn't take her.
You have to let me help.

08:20.822 --> 08:22.215
We need
to find her.

08:22.345 --> 08:24.260
You think I can
keep a baby secret?

08:24.391 --> 08:26.088
You think I want
that kind of heat?

08:26.219 --> 08:28.917
The baby went missing shortly
after you showed up here.

08:29.048 --> 08:31.616
Of course I'd be
the first person he'd suspect.

08:31.746 --> 08:33.226
Why would I put her in danger
like that?

08:33.356 --> 08:35.968
Because you don't want her
to grow up here.

08:36.098 --> 08:39.493
Because you're angry
about what happened with Ali.

08:39.624 --> 08:41.016
Aren't you?

08:41.147 --> 08:42.452
That's not
what this is about.

08:42.583 --> 08:43.584
Then what is
this about?

08:43.715 --> 08:45.194
Making sure
that baby is safe.

08:47.109 --> 08:51.026
Something that will
never happen here.

08:53.202 --> 08:55.814
Do you know something,
June?

08:55.944 --> 08:57.337
Do you know
where Mo is?

08:58.947 --> 09:02.255
We both want
the same things, John.

09:02.385 --> 09:04.692
And the only way
that is going to happen...

09:09.784 --> 09:12.047
...is if
we take out Strand.

09:14.441 --> 09:16.574
And what does that
have to do with Mo?

09:23.581 --> 09:25.408
Morgan and the others
are not gonna make their move

09:25.539 --> 09:28.063
as long as the baby
is in this Tower.

09:28.194 --> 09:30.326
And Strand knows that.

09:30.457 --> 09:32.415
He loses her,

09:32.546 --> 09:36.115
he loses
all his leverage.

09:36.245 --> 09:37.638
You're gonna
sneak her out.

09:37.769 --> 09:38.900
I didn't say that.

09:39.031 --> 09:40.510
Strand was right.

09:40.641 --> 09:42.643
The resistance is real,
and you're part of it.

09:42.774 --> 09:44.253
The less you know,
the better.

09:44.384 --> 09:46.429
Don't give me that.

09:46.560 --> 09:47.866
Talk to me,
June.

09:47.996 --> 09:49.519
Maybe I can help.

09:51.609 --> 09:53.698
You really want
to help?

09:53.828 --> 09:56.265
Keep Howard distracted.

09:56.396 --> 09:59.007
I'll do the rest.

09:59.138 --> 10:00.313
He's not part of this?

10:00.443 --> 10:01.444
The walkie
in his room?

10:01.575 --> 10:02.663
That wasn't me.

10:02.794 --> 10:05.448
You'd tell me
if it was?

10:05.579 --> 10:07.581
I have to go,
John.

10:19.593 --> 10:21.464
Don't touch that.

10:29.211 --> 10:31.518
Quite the collection
you've got here, Howard.

10:31.649 --> 10:32.519
Look,
I don't got time for this.

10:32.650 --> 10:34.782
I have to find
that baby.

10:37.219 --> 10:38.481
Yeah,
so do I.

10:38.612 --> 10:41.528
Victor asked me
to look, too.

10:44.836 --> 10:47.403
He didn't mention that
to me.

10:47.534 --> 10:48.796
Can you blame him

10:48.927 --> 10:50.493
after that walkie
turned up in here?

10:50.624 --> 10:52.539
It wasn't mine!

10:52.670 --> 10:53.888
Whoever put it here,

10:54.019 --> 10:56.282
they are getting
exactly what they want.

10:56.412 --> 10:58.937
Oh, I believe you.

10:59.067 --> 11:01.156
But you understand why
I also have to question you,

11:01.287 --> 11:03.202
just like I would
anybody else.

11:12.298 --> 11:13.734
Drink?

11:17.085 --> 11:20.262
Ah, I don't touch
the stuff anymore.

11:20.393 --> 11:22.612
Suit yourself.

11:27.966 --> 11:29.402
So what is it
you want to know?

11:32.361 --> 11:34.755
What I heard
up on the roof --

11:34.886 --> 11:36.017
There's a great deal

11:36.148 --> 11:39.325
I don't know
about you, Howard.

11:39.455 --> 11:40.674
Like what?

11:40.805 --> 11:42.110
Well,
for starters,

11:42.241 --> 11:44.373
you never struck me
as a family man.

11:44.504 --> 11:46.506
Why not?

11:46.636 --> 11:47.986
Oh,
let's just call it

11:48.116 --> 11:50.771
a general lack of compassion
and restraint.

11:50.902 --> 11:52.164
Mm.

11:52.294 --> 11:55.428
And this coming from a man
who abandoned his own son.

11:55.558 --> 11:58.692
We're not talking about me
right now.

11:58.823 --> 12:01.651
Strand mentioned
a wife, a son.

12:04.393 --> 12:06.091
That them?

12:09.355 --> 12:10.791
Where are they?

12:15.535 --> 12:17.363
I don't know.

12:17.493 --> 12:19.800
Get split up
after the bomb?

12:19.931 --> 12:21.367
My wife left me

12:21.497 --> 12:24.674
before the world did what it did
the first time.

12:24.805 --> 12:26.720
She took
our son with her.

12:26.851 --> 12:30.245
Why?

12:30.376 --> 12:31.812
You ever hear
of the Travis Letter?

12:33.727 --> 12:36.469
William Barrett Travis,
1836.

12:36.599 --> 12:39.646
On the second day
of the siege of the Alamo,

12:39.777 --> 12:43.041
he writes a letter
asking for reinforcements.

12:43.171 --> 12:46.609
He signs it
"victory or death."

12:46.740 --> 12:48.307
What's that got to do
with your family?

12:48.437 --> 12:50.309
The Travis Letter is one of
the most famous documents

12:50.439 --> 12:52.311
in the history
of Texas.

12:52.441 --> 12:55.227
What people didn't know was that
there was more to it,

12:55.357 --> 12:58.491
an addendum that
I personally discovered.

12:58.621 --> 13:01.973
It made me the toast
of the historical community.

13:02.103 --> 13:05.498
I traveled all over,
giving lectures,

13:05.628 --> 13:08.849
months and months away
from Matin and his mom.

13:08.980 --> 13:11.678
Sounds like
quite the achievement.

13:11.809 --> 13:13.723
I forged it.

13:16.204 --> 13:18.685
Suddenly, all those papers
that had been praising me

13:18.816 --> 13:22.645
were smearing
my name.

13:22.776 --> 13:24.909
One day,
I come home,

13:25.039 --> 13:29.435
my wife's at the door,
bags packed.

13:29.565 --> 13:31.480
All over the letter?

13:31.611 --> 13:33.656
She said I was more concerned
with making history

13:33.787 --> 13:35.093
than I was with...

13:35.223 --> 13:37.878
making a life
for her and my son.

13:40.663 --> 13:43.666
But this place...

13:43.797 --> 13:47.061
I have
made history here.

13:47.192 --> 13:48.846
My wife and boy
are out there somewhere,

13:48.976 --> 13:50.325
and if
they find it,

13:50.456 --> 13:52.893
they'll see that this history
can be their life.

13:55.504 --> 13:58.943
So what you call a lack
of compassion and restraint,

13:59.073 --> 14:01.293
I call
building a legacy.

14:04.209 --> 14:05.514
What?

14:07.734 --> 14:10.128
We've covered
a five-mile radius.

14:10.258 --> 14:12.478
The baby
is not out there.

14:12.608 --> 14:14.132
Maybe you didn't
search hard enough.The storm's
getting bad, Howard.

14:14.262 --> 14:16.003
Then we'll keep
searching inside.

14:16.134 --> 14:19.050
We've already
combed the place.Then comb again.

14:21.052 --> 14:23.097
Are we done here?

14:29.277 --> 14:32.628
Those people you've thrown
off the roof.

14:32.759 --> 14:35.327
How do they fit
into that legacy?

14:37.459 --> 14:41.202
Look, I'm not proud
of everything I've done here,

14:41.333 --> 14:43.944
but if it all leads to my family
finding this place,

14:44.075 --> 14:46.729
then it will have been
worth it.

14:46.860 --> 14:49.167
And if
they don't find it?

14:49.297 --> 14:52.170
I don't like to think
about that

14:52.300 --> 14:54.694
because then that would mean
everything I've done...

14:54.824 --> 14:56.522
has been for nothing.

15:08.273 --> 15:09.883
June.

15:10.014 --> 15:11.580
John.

15:15.758 --> 15:18.413
How did you know?Your boots.

15:18.544 --> 15:21.373
The ground down here
gets muddy when it rains.

15:35.604 --> 15:36.562
How'd you hide her?

15:36.692 --> 15:38.781
Does it matter?

15:42.829 --> 15:44.483
What's this?

15:44.613 --> 15:46.572
For protection, in case I ran
into trouble with the moat.

15:46.702 --> 15:48.791
You actually think
that would have protected you?

15:48.922 --> 15:51.011
It's worked before.

15:51.142 --> 15:53.796
That woman,
the wrestler?

15:53.927 --> 15:55.102
You think
you could do the same.

15:55.233 --> 15:56.190
Well, hopefully,
I won't have to,

15:56.321 --> 15:58.584
but if
that's what it takes.

16:00.499 --> 16:02.370
The tunnel's flooding.

16:02.501 --> 16:04.764
That's why this needs
to happen now.

16:04.894 --> 16:06.896
It's not safe.

16:07.027 --> 16:08.942
Morgan is posted up
about a half a mile away.

16:09.073 --> 16:11.597
He's ready to take her
as soon as we get her out.

16:11.727 --> 16:13.773
June!

16:18.082 --> 16:19.431
John, I can't!

16:23.957 --> 16:25.437
I need help
with this gate!

16:25.567 --> 16:27.613
I'm coming!

16:31.095 --> 16:33.445
John, hurry!

16:57.773 --> 17:00.080
We just need to get
to the elevator.

17:00.211 --> 17:01.995
What are you
talking about?

17:02.126 --> 17:03.997
I'm sorry, June, but I can't
let you leave with her.

17:04.128 --> 17:05.564
I'm gonna cement
my legacy,

17:05.694 --> 17:06.826
and you're
gonna help me.

17:20.883 --> 17:23.930
Dorie Sr.: We have to get moving
before more come washing in.

17:24.061 --> 17:25.758
My gun's over there,
by the tunnel.

17:25.888 --> 17:27.281
If I can get to it, we can
clear a path to the elevator.

17:27.412 --> 17:29.109
I thought you came down here
to help me.

17:31.807 --> 17:34.114
I came to help her.

17:34.245 --> 17:36.203
Why are you
doing this?

17:43.819 --> 17:46.039
What's that?

17:46.170 --> 17:48.433
It's just a song
John used to like.

17:48.563 --> 17:50.652
Shh.

17:55.744 --> 17:57.529
You want to do for her
what you couldn't do for him.

17:59.705 --> 18:02.273
I lost a child, too,
John.

18:02.403 --> 18:04.579
I get it.

18:04.710 --> 18:07.016
We need to give Mo
her best chance.

18:07.147 --> 18:11.064
She has it here, now,
with Victor,

18:11.195 --> 18:14.241
which is why I have to get her
up there before Howard does.

18:14.372 --> 18:16.156
John, have you been
drinking again?

18:16.287 --> 18:17.592
Why the hell
would you ask me that?

18:17.723 --> 18:19.594
Because you're not making
any sense.

18:19.725 --> 18:21.988
Strand is not
going to listen to you.He will.

18:22.119 --> 18:23.990
He has to.
Why?

18:24.121 --> 18:25.818
Because I set this all
in motion!

18:25.948 --> 18:27.994
What are you
talking about?

18:28.125 --> 18:29.952
The walkie.

18:30.083 --> 18:32.259
I planted it
in Howard's room.

18:33.913 --> 18:35.306
I knew it was the only way
I was gonna get Strand

18:35.436 --> 18:37.308
to listen to me
over Howard.

18:40.311 --> 18:42.965
You're doing it again.What?

18:43.096 --> 18:46.404
The same thing you did
when you planted that purse

18:46.534 --> 18:49.885
to make sure
that Teddy went to jail.

18:50.016 --> 18:51.670
John,
it destroyed your life.

18:51.800 --> 18:53.062
It destroyed you.

18:53.193 --> 18:54.629
Please don't make
that same mistake twice.

18:54.760 --> 18:56.457
This is different.
How?

18:56.588 --> 18:58.067
Because the last time
I did the wrong thing

18:58.198 --> 19:01.114
for the right reason,
I abandoned my son.

19:01.245 --> 19:03.421
I won't do that
to her.

19:03.551 --> 19:04.813
Won't have
what happened to John,

19:04.944 --> 19:06.772
what's happening
to Charlie...

19:06.902 --> 19:09.035
won't happen to her.

19:09.166 --> 19:11.211
I'll make this place

19:11.342 --> 19:12.604
the world I should have made
for my boy.

19:12.734 --> 19:14.432
You can still
do that.

19:14.562 --> 19:16.216
We can
change things here,

19:16.347 --> 19:19.176
but not while Strand
is in charge.

19:19.306 --> 19:22.266
What you want --
I can't risk it.

19:22.396 --> 19:24.355
Why not?

19:24.485 --> 19:27.706
You can't answer me
because you know I'm right.

19:31.623 --> 19:33.320
We've got to move.

19:39.196 --> 19:41.720
I'm gonna go
for the gun.

19:41.850 --> 19:44.940
You guard her
with your life.

19:45.071 --> 19:46.942
What are you
gonna do?

19:47.073 --> 19:50.337
Get through them,
same way Mickey did.

19:57.823 --> 19:59.651
Go!

20:04.960 --> 20:06.048
John!

20:06.179 --> 20:08.094
We're not
gonna make it.

20:08.225 --> 20:09.530
The tunnel!

20:09.661 --> 20:11.489
Take her
before more come!
I can't!

20:11.619 --> 20:13.752
You have to,
John!

20:13.882 --> 20:15.449
You want to secure
your legacy,

20:15.580 --> 20:16.624
you want
to help Mo?

20:16.755 --> 20:18.800
This is how.

20:18.931 --> 20:21.281
Go!

20:21.412 --> 20:23.327
Go!
John, go!

20:31.378 --> 20:33.293
Get out of here!
Take the baby!

20:37.863 --> 20:39.865
I only
have one left.

20:39.995 --> 20:41.519
You don't need it.
The tunnel.

20:41.649 --> 20:43.477
I'm not leaving.

20:47.133 --> 20:48.700
We gotta get back.

20:54.445 --> 20:57.099
You had a way out!

20:57.230 --> 20:59.798
Still do.

20:59.928 --> 21:01.539
Call them.
Who?

21:01.669 --> 21:03.976
Whoever helped you plan
this little escape.

21:04.106 --> 21:05.412
Get them down here
to help us.

21:05.543 --> 21:07.675
If they get caught,
Strand will kill them.

21:07.806 --> 21:09.198
Call them!

21:09.329 --> 21:11.375
Why don't you want her to leave?
What are you so afraid of?

21:11.505 --> 21:13.290
Because she'll die
outside these walls.

21:13.420 --> 21:14.682
Not if
we're careful.

21:14.813 --> 21:17.337
That won't matter.
Why not?

21:17.468 --> 21:19.774
Because it didn't
for Charlie.

21:19.905 --> 21:23.561
Because it didn't
for me.I don't understand.

21:30.350 --> 21:32.352
I don't have
much time, June.

21:57.551 --> 22:00.032
Grace...

22:00.162 --> 22:02.513
I need some help.

22:10.085 --> 22:11.957
Grace should have been here
by now.

22:12.087 --> 22:14.394
Why didn't you
tell me sooner?

22:14.525 --> 22:16.657
Would it have made
any difference?

22:16.788 --> 22:18.703
How did it happen?

22:18.833 --> 22:20.922
Bringing Charlie back
from that building.

22:21.053 --> 22:24.099
I must have got exposed
to the same thing she did.

22:24.230 --> 22:25.753
I was careful.

22:25.884 --> 22:27.407
I was quick.

22:27.538 --> 22:30.192
It still got me.

22:30.323 --> 22:31.585
Like it or not,

22:31.716 --> 22:33.892
this is the only place
she'll be safe.

22:34.022 --> 22:35.459
I don't have
much time left.

22:35.589 --> 22:37.504
You don't know that.

22:39.985 --> 22:42.814
I thought John was gonna be
my legacy, and now --

22:44.555 --> 22:46.339
I can't lose
another child.

22:46.470 --> 22:48.863
I can't
have that be

22:48.994 --> 22:52.127
the last thing I do
in this life.

22:52.258 --> 22:54.434
You and Grace, you'll be able
to keep her safe in here.

22:54.565 --> 22:56.871
You'll be able
to control Strand.

23:02.007 --> 23:03.225
Victor.

23:03.356 --> 23:04.488
Caught Grace
in the elevator

23:04.618 --> 23:07.142
on the way down here.

23:07.273 --> 23:09.318
She wouldn't say why.

23:11.233 --> 23:14.323
Seems to me we've identified
the resistance.

23:16.848 --> 23:18.937
It's exactly
who we thought.

23:19.067 --> 23:21.853
It's not
what it looks like.

23:21.983 --> 23:23.594
Oh, I'm sure.

23:41.176 --> 23:43.396
Hmm.

23:56.627 --> 23:58.542
Told you
I'd find her.

23:58.672 --> 24:00.935
You didn't find her.

24:01.066 --> 24:02.502
He did.

24:14.471 --> 24:16.647
I got you.

24:33.881 --> 24:35.230
What we're
building here

24:35.361 --> 24:37.537
is no less
than a civilization,

24:37.668 --> 24:39.321
and no civilization
can stand

24:39.452 --> 24:41.149
without
a unified people.

24:41.280 --> 24:42.542
I've been fighting
by your side

24:42.673 --> 24:44.718
since the beginning,
Victor.

24:44.849 --> 24:46.938
And you, John?

24:47.068 --> 24:48.330
Do you believe
in this place?

24:48.461 --> 24:50.419
I believe in
what it can be.

24:50.550 --> 24:52.596
I believe it's the best way
for that child to survive.

24:52.726 --> 24:53.771
He's lying to you.

24:53.901 --> 24:55.773
He was trying
to help her escape.

24:55.903 --> 24:57.688
Shut up.

24:57.818 --> 25:00.342
You said
you believed in this place.

25:00.473 --> 25:01.953
Show me.

25:02.083 --> 25:05.434
How?

25:05.565 --> 25:07.132
Push him
over the edge.

25:07.262 --> 25:09.438
What?
You heard me.

25:09.569 --> 25:11.005
We had a deal,
Victor.

25:11.136 --> 25:14.443
I said I'd spare you
if you found the baby.

25:14.574 --> 25:16.750
You didn't.After everything
I've done!

25:16.881 --> 25:18.404
The moment
we found that walkie,

25:18.535 --> 25:21.015
any faith
I had in you eroded.

25:21.146 --> 25:22.843
It wasn't mine!

25:22.974 --> 25:24.584
He's right.

25:24.715 --> 25:26.630
He doesn't
deserve this, Victor.

25:26.760 --> 25:29.415
Why is that?

25:29.546 --> 25:31.983
Because I planted
that walkie.

25:33.941 --> 25:35.769
You see, Victor?

25:38.076 --> 25:41.253
Wait.

25:41.383 --> 25:44.778
You framed Howard in order
to gain audience with me?

25:49.043 --> 25:50.131
Wow.

25:50.262 --> 25:52.612
Oh.

25:52.743 --> 25:55.746
I underestimated you,
John.

25:55.876 --> 25:58.792
You don't do something like that
unless you're invested.

25:58.923 --> 26:00.620
Come on!
You can't be serious?

26:00.751 --> 26:02.404
I'm still
gonna need you to do

26:02.535 --> 26:05.277
that other thing
I asked.

26:05.407 --> 26:06.974
I won't do that.

26:07.105 --> 26:09.411
You will do it, unless you
want me to bring June up here.

26:09.542 --> 26:11.631
No.
Or Grace.

26:17.419 --> 26:18.595
John, no,
my family.

26:18.725 --> 26:20.422
I'm sorry,
but you did the same

26:20.553 --> 26:22.337
to others
for far less.

26:22.468 --> 26:24.122
Please! No, John!
Wait, no!

26:24.252 --> 26:25.384
John, no!

26:34.436 --> 26:37.875
I wouldn't worry
about him too much.

26:38.005 --> 26:41.313
His family was never gonna
find this place.

26:41.443 --> 26:43.794
Why not?Because they're dead.

26:43.924 --> 26:46.231
Our scouts found them
months ago.

26:46.361 --> 26:48.581
They'd been turned for
a long time, so it seems.

26:48.712 --> 26:51.802
You knew his wife and son
were dead and you said nothing?

26:51.932 --> 26:54.065
Why would I?

26:54.195 --> 26:56.371
It's what drove him
to help me

26:56.502 --> 26:58.678
build this place
to what it's become.

26:58.809 --> 27:00.985
Everyone needs something
to drive them, John.

27:07.513 --> 27:09.384
His apartment
is all yours.

27:09.515 --> 27:11.169
You can
move in immediately.

27:11.299 --> 27:13.954
Consider it
a signing bonus.

27:14.085 --> 27:15.956
What is it
that you said?

27:16.087 --> 27:19.307
You're only as good
as your partner.

27:19.438 --> 27:22.789
Well, here's to
a great partnership, my friend.

29:07.807 --> 29:09.896
I thought you were
off the sauce.

29:13.726 --> 29:15.032
I was.

29:15.162 --> 29:18.818
Well, far be it
from me to judge.

29:18.949 --> 29:21.038
Pour me one,
would you?

29:21.168 --> 29:22.648
Come on, baby.

29:43.756 --> 29:45.671
To our future.

29:53.200 --> 29:55.724
Feel free to junk
all this stuff.

30:01.339 --> 30:03.950
Howard certainly has no use
for them anymore.

30:16.136 --> 30:18.051
Hm.

30:33.850 --> 30:35.634
Why so loud?

30:35.764 --> 30:38.289
So we're not overheard.

30:38.419 --> 30:41.466
I don't want what happened today
to happen ever again.

30:44.382 --> 30:46.036
Things need to change.

30:49.517 --> 30:52.694
Are you ready to listen
to those ideas I mentioned?

30:52.825 --> 30:55.088
I have
some ideas of my own.

30:58.265 --> 31:01.181
I know that Grace was in
on what happened today,

31:01.312 --> 31:03.662
as was June.

31:03.792 --> 31:06.186
I'm going to remand Mo

31:06.317 --> 31:10.887
to my sole custody
permanently.

31:11.017 --> 31:13.324
How exactly
does that work?

31:13.454 --> 31:15.848
Mo will be raised
in the penthouse by me,

31:15.979 --> 31:20.331
without any
outside interference.

31:20.461 --> 31:22.507
You can't keep her away
from her mother.

31:22.637 --> 31:26.380
Her mother is dead.

31:26.511 --> 31:29.209
Grace is a stand-in.

31:32.734 --> 31:36.651
So how do I fit
into all this?

31:36.782 --> 31:38.131
You do whatever it is
you need to do

31:38.262 --> 31:40.699
to ensure that no one
takes that baby.

31:46.313 --> 31:48.881
That baby is never going to
give you what you want.

31:50.883 --> 31:53.233
And what is that?

31:53.364 --> 31:54.713
To love you.

31:54.843 --> 31:56.584
To look up
to you.

31:56.715 --> 32:00.197
And the more you want it,
the more you fight for it,

32:00.327 --> 32:02.199
the more you'll end up
driving her away.

32:05.680 --> 32:07.204
And remind me,

32:07.334 --> 32:10.642
what happened
to your son, John?

32:10.772 --> 32:13.384
Why do you think I'm trying
to get through to you here?

32:16.126 --> 32:18.998
If you really want her
to love you,

32:19.129 --> 32:21.566
then let me help you
change how you do things here.

32:24.351 --> 32:27.137
When I want your counsel,
I'll ask.

32:33.795 --> 32:36.363
You were never going to listen
to what I had to say, were you?

32:36.494 --> 32:38.322
As I told you before,

32:38.452 --> 32:41.586
everyone needs something
to drive them, John.

32:41.716 --> 32:43.849
What you did today

32:43.980 --> 32:47.287
will echo
long into the future.

32:47.418 --> 32:49.811
It will outlive you.

32:49.942 --> 32:51.944
It will be
your legacy.

33:00.822 --> 33:02.955
No, it won't.

33:03.086 --> 33:06.524
This place
isn't my legacy.

33:06.654 --> 33:08.265
She is.

33:15.750 --> 33:17.839
Morgan,
do you copy?

33:17.970 --> 33:20.277
Hey, Mr. Dorie.
That you?

33:20.407 --> 33:21.887
Are you still
close by?

33:22.018 --> 33:25.108
Just beyond the wall,
why?

33:25.238 --> 33:27.197
Stay where you are.

33:41.211 --> 33:43.256
I'm bringing her
to you.

34:00.404 --> 34:02.971
You don't
have to do this, John.

34:03.102 --> 34:05.235
I can do it.
I can take her.

34:05.365 --> 34:06.845
I can do this.

34:06.975 --> 34:09.413
I want
to do this.

34:09.543 --> 34:12.938
Should we do
the thing?What thing?

34:13.069 --> 34:15.767
You know, pull in a skinbag
and gut him up,

34:15.897 --> 34:17.682
spread the nasty
to throw them off the scent.

34:17.812 --> 34:19.553
We don't have time,

34:19.684 --> 34:22.252
and it wouldn't be safe
for Mo.

34:22.382 --> 34:23.644
I got this.

34:23.775 --> 34:25.385
You got some brass cojones,
my friend.

34:25.516 --> 34:27.126
It's not about me.

34:29.911 --> 34:33.480
Be brave,
my little girl, okay?

34:33.611 --> 34:35.961
Be brave.

34:36.092 --> 34:37.484
It's okay.

34:37.615 --> 34:40.966
It's okay.

34:41.097 --> 34:43.229
Be brave.

34:53.457 --> 34:55.720
You don't stop 'til
you get to Morgan, okay?

34:58.549 --> 35:01.160
A lot of things I got wrong
in this life.

35:01.291 --> 35:04.163
This won't
be one of them.

35:04.294 --> 35:06.383
You need to go, John.

35:10.343 --> 35:13.433
It's never too late.

35:13.564 --> 35:15.392
Thanks for helping me
remember that, June.

35:28.448 --> 35:31.625
Oh, wait.

35:31.756 --> 35:33.932
She likes it
when I sing to her.

35:34.062 --> 35:36.761
It soothes her.

35:36.891 --> 35:39.111
John was the same way.

35:42.158 --> 35:43.507
What'd you sing to him?

35:46.901 --> 35:47.815
Victor.

35:47.946 --> 35:50.122
Hey, Victor.

35:50.253 --> 35:52.037
Hey.

35:52.168 --> 35:53.343
Where is he?

35:53.473 --> 35:55.997
Where's the baby?

35:56.128 --> 35:57.782
Take the edge off.

36:03.570 --> 36:05.006
The rangers are combing
the Tower.

36:05.137 --> 36:08.009
They'll find her.

36:08.140 --> 36:09.489
The tunnel's flooded.

36:09.620 --> 36:11.056
There's no
other way out.

36:17.497 --> 36:19.369
There's one.

36:34.993 --> 36:39.171
Dorie Sr.:

37:03.978 --> 37:05.458
Victor.

37:10.115 --> 37:12.596
What do you
want to do?

37:12.726 --> 37:14.946
You know, I thought
I found a new partner.

37:15.076 --> 37:17.078
He said he wanted
to make this place better.

37:17.209 --> 37:18.341
He disappointed me.

37:18.471 --> 37:20.081
That's what people do.

37:20.212 --> 37:22.780
You still looking?

37:22.910 --> 37:24.216
For what?

37:24.347 --> 37:26.827
A partner.

37:30.004 --> 37:31.876
There's an old antennae
in storage.

37:32.006 --> 37:33.312
Bring it to me.

37:33.443 --> 37:34.618
Antennae?

37:42.669 --> 37:47.239
Dorie Sr.:

38:47.647 --> 38:49.519
Mr. Dorie.

38:52.304 --> 38:54.393
I got you.
I got you.

38:54.524 --> 38:55.742
Hey,
you're good.

38:55.873 --> 38:57.744
You're good.

39:00.225 --> 39:02.183
We need to move.
I can't.

39:02.314 --> 39:03.750
Why not?

39:03.881 --> 39:06.753
What is --

39:06.884 --> 39:09.887
Oh, my God.

39:15.371 --> 39:17.198
I'll buy you
some time.

39:17.329 --> 39:19.200
I'm sorry.

39:19.331 --> 39:20.419
You take care of her,
Morgan!

39:20.550 --> 39:22.769
I will.

39:22.900 --> 39:25.076
And thanks,
John.

39:25.206 --> 39:29.863
Dorie Sr.:

39:49.405 --> 39:53.017
Is it ready?

39:53.147 --> 39:54.932
It's done.

39:55.062 --> 39:56.803
Give me that walkie.

40:01.460 --> 40:04.115
You may have won
the battle today, Morgan,

40:04.245 --> 40:05.769
but the war
is just beginning.

40:05.899 --> 40:08.293
I have people here
that you care about.

40:08.424 --> 40:10.643
June, Grace,

40:10.774 --> 40:14.255
and if you take
a step into this place,

40:14.386 --> 40:16.388
I will kill them.

40:23.395 --> 40:24.831
As for
the rest of you,

40:24.962 --> 40:27.486
you know
who you are.

40:27.617 --> 40:30.707
The offer to join me
still stands.

40:30.837 --> 40:32.709
I need
good people here

40:32.839 --> 40:35.059
to help me secure
the future of this place.

40:38.192 --> 40:39.759
If you're listening...

40:39.890 --> 40:42.196
you know
where to find me.

40:47.767 --> 40:52.598
Dorie Sr.:

41:09.746 --> 41:11.965
The Tower's unguarded
at least until dawn.

41:12.096 --> 41:13.227
We're not ready.
Why?

41:14.490 --> 41:15.447
You think
we're gonna lose.

41:15.578 --> 41:17.362
We're outmanned
and outgunned.

41:18.668 --> 41:20.974
It's starting to
leak radiation.

41:21.105 --> 41:23.107
I got a plan.
Trust me.

41:28.460 --> 41:29.461
What the hell?

41:41.778 --> 41:44.476
You were never going to listen
to what I had to say, were you?

41:44.607 --> 41:48.001
As I told you before,
everyone needs something

41:48.132 --> 41:49.568
to drive them, John.

41:49.699 --> 41:54.878
What you did today
will echo long into the future.

41:55.008 --> 41:58.359
There's a few reasons why
Dorie Sr. makes his move now.

41:58.490 --> 42:01.406
You know, the biggest one is,
as we learn later

42:01.537 --> 42:04.061
in the episode, Dorie Sr.
has been exposed

42:04.191 --> 42:07.499
to radiation poisoning,
and he's got a very limited

42:07.630 --> 42:09.022
amount of time left.

42:09.153 --> 42:11.024
There's also the fact that he's
looking at Charlie,

42:11.155 --> 42:13.940
with her radiation poisoning
there in that early scene

42:14.071 --> 42:17.030
with June, and we just see this
weighing on him.

42:17.161 --> 42:19.467
He's going to have to make some
changes here in the Tower,

42:19.598 --> 42:23.428
because he also sees Strand
going down this bad path,

42:23.559 --> 42:25.430
giving into his worst impulses.

42:25.561 --> 42:28.825
And so Dorie Sr. now feels like,
"I've got to get in his ear

42:28.955 --> 42:31.958
and change the way he does
things before it's too late."

42:33.569 --> 42:35.962
Great deal I don't know
about you, Howard.

42:36.093 --> 42:38.225
I think Dorie Sr.'s perception
of Howard

42:38.356 --> 42:40.401
changes as the episode goes on.

42:40.532 --> 42:42.882
At the beginning of the episode,
I think he sees him

42:43.013 --> 42:46.930
as someone who, as he says,
lacks compassion and restraint.

42:47.060 --> 42:49.715
That he's just this ultimate
Strand loyalist.

42:49.846 --> 42:53.980
My wife left me before the world
did what it did the first time.

42:54.111 --> 42:55.982
She took our son with her.

42:56.113 --> 42:57.984
As he gets to know him
a little better,

42:58.115 --> 43:00.987
he realizes that he's not
that different,

43:01.118 --> 43:04.600
and that Howard is ultimately
driven by this need

43:04.730 --> 43:06.906
to make a place for his family,

43:07.037 --> 43:09.126
that he believes
is still out there,

43:09.256 --> 43:12.042
and that this is going to make
everything he's done worth it.

43:12.172 --> 43:14.479
No! No, wait!

43:14.610 --> 43:16.481
It wasn't mine! I swear!

43:16.612 --> 43:17.482
You know the rules,
Howard!

43:17.613 --> 43:19.658
I didn't do this!

43:19.789 --> 43:21.791
I need people
I can trust,

43:21.921 --> 43:24.010
now more than ever.

43:24.141 --> 43:26.752
I think the rule about
no walkies in the Tower

43:26.883 --> 43:30.321
just is another example
of Strand's increasing paranoia,

43:30.451 --> 43:33.977
and him locking things down,
you know, ruling this place

43:34.107 --> 43:38.198
with an iron fist because he has
grown more and more concerned

43:38.329 --> 43:41.898
about enemies forming against
him from the inside.

43:42.028 --> 43:45.379
He really is backed into
a corner, and he's acting

43:45.510 --> 43:47.686
in an extreme, extreme way.

43:47.817 --> 43:49.775
The moment we found
that walkie,

43:49.906 --> 43:52.256
any faith I had in you
eroded.

43:52.386 --> 43:54.084
It wasn't mine!

43:54.214 --> 43:55.694
He's right!

43:55.825 --> 43:57.827
He doesn't deserve this,
Victor.

43:57.957 --> 44:00.307
Why is that?

44:00.438 --> 44:04.224
Because I planted
that walkie.

44:04.355 --> 44:07.140
John planting the walkie is very
much a move Victor Strand

44:07.271 --> 44:10.100
himself would have done,
so I think he probably senses

44:10.230 --> 44:13.016
a bit of a kindred spirit there,
and also,

44:13.146 --> 44:14.713
as he says,
"You wouldn't have done that

44:14.844 --> 44:16.193
unless you were invested."

44:18.195 --> 44:20.110
This was all sort
of a test,

44:20.240 --> 44:22.634
and John has passed
the test.

44:22.765 --> 44:24.897
And then ultimately,
there is one more piece

44:25.028 --> 44:27.639
of that test that Strand needs
to see.

44:27.770 --> 44:29.380
No, John!
Wait, no!

44:29.510 --> 44:33.079
John! No!

44:33.210 --> 44:34.733
The gut punch
that comes from that,

44:34.864 --> 44:37.083
aside from having to kill
Howard,

44:37.214 --> 44:39.259
is the reveal that Strand gives
him right after that,

44:39.390 --> 44:40.870
which is...

44:41.000 --> 44:43.568
His family was never
going to find this place.

44:43.699 --> 44:45.570
Why not?
Because they're dead.

44:45.701 --> 44:47.398
And Dorie Sr. realizes
in that moment,

44:47.528 --> 44:50.401
that is exactly what Strand
has done to him --

44:50.531 --> 44:55.014
he has dangled this carrot of
getting into the inner sanctum,

44:55.145 --> 44:58.539
having Strand as an audience,
to motivate John

44:58.670 --> 45:00.063
to do what he wants.

45:00.193 --> 45:03.370
And that's why when we find
Dorie again, it causes him

45:03.501 --> 45:05.242
to do the thing he hasn't done
in so long,

45:05.372 --> 45:07.200
which is pick up the bottle
again.

45:11.117 --> 45:12.379
I'm going to make
this place the world

45:12.510 --> 45:13.511
I should have made
for my boy.

45:13.641 --> 45:15.426
You could still do that.

45:15.556 --> 45:16.775
We can change things here,

45:16.906 --> 45:19.430
but not while
Strand is in charge.

45:19.560 --> 45:23.608
I think when John looks at Mo,
he's not just seeing Mo,

45:23.739 --> 45:27.351
he's seeing John Dorie Jr.,
he's seeing Charlie,

45:27.481 --> 45:29.701
he's seeing, you know,
these young kids

45:29.832 --> 45:33.357
that he feels responsible for
not being able to help.

45:37.143 --> 45:39.276
He realizes that he's going to
have to take

45:39.406 --> 45:42.235
a really desperate action to
make sure that baby Mo

45:42.366 --> 45:44.803
has the life that he wanted for
her, and he realizes that

45:44.934 --> 45:47.719
that life can't happen
in the Tower.

45:52.419 --> 45:56.380
It's so hard to watch
this episode and say goodbye

45:56.510 --> 45:58.034
to Keith Carradine.

45:58.164 --> 46:02.603
He is this character.
He's got so much gravitas

46:02.734 --> 46:04.605
and strength.

46:04.736 --> 46:07.043
There are a lot of things
I got wrong in this life.

46:07.173 --> 46:09.045
This won't be one of them.

46:09.175 --> 46:11.917
He just brings something
that no one else

46:12.048 --> 46:13.701
could have brought
to this role.

46:13.832 --> 46:17.053
We were such big fans of his
from his, you know, very,

46:17.183 --> 46:19.533
you know, long
and impressive body of work,

46:19.664 --> 46:21.492
bringing him into the show.

46:21.622 --> 46:24.190
And what we always like to say
is that when characters die

46:24.321 --> 46:26.062
or when we say goodbye
to characters,

46:26.192 --> 46:28.934
we want it to hurt.
We want it to be impactful

46:29.065 --> 46:30.414
because that means
that you cared.

46:31.981 --> 46:33.852
We need to move.I can't.

46:33.983 --> 46:36.202
Why not?

46:37.595 --> 46:39.771
Let me see.

46:39.902 --> 46:41.033
Oh, my --

46:41.164 --> 46:43.470
And this episode is just
so painful to watch.

46:43.601 --> 46:47.344
His final sacrifice, you know,
both painful and beautiful,

46:47.474 --> 46:49.650
just is a real testament to
Keith's incredible work

46:49.781 --> 46:52.305
as an actor and what he brought
to this role,

46:52.436 --> 46:55.482
and we're very, very grateful
to have had the chance

46:55.613 --> 46:57.093
to work with him.
