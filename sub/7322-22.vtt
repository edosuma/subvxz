09:42.953 --> 09:45.956
(Alex) YOU PAGED SURGERY?
HAYLEY MAY, 16, DIAGNOSED
PARANOID SCHIZOPHRENIC.

09:45.956 --> 09:48.789
TRIED TO CLAW HER EYES OUT.
I NEED YOU TO CLEAR HER

09:48.789 --> 09:52.092
BEFORE I CAN TAKE HER
UP TO PSYCH.
SHE TRIED
TO CLAW HER EYES OUT?

09:52.092 --> 09:54.965
WE TRY TO KEEP HER SAFE.
SHE'S ON EVERY MED IN THE BOOK.

09:54.965 --> 09:57.898
BUT SHE DOESN'T EAT,
SHE DOESN'T SLEEP.

09:57.898 --> 10:00.070
THE SLIGHTEST THING
SETS HER OFF, TALKING EVEN,

10:00.070 --> 10:02.933
SO WE'RE HAVING HER COMMITTED.
WE EXPLAINED TO HER

10:02.933 --> 10:05.375
THAT THEY WERE COMING
TO GET HER TO TRY AND HELP.

10:05.375 --> 10:08.238
WE TURNED OUR BACK FOR A MINUTE,
JUST FOR ONE MINUTE--

10:08.238 --> 10:10.110
(instruments clatter)
OH, MY GOD.

10:10.110 --> 10:12.142
HAYLEY--
THAT'S LORAZEPAM IN THERE.

10:12.142 --> 10:15.115
(voice breaking) I'LL DO IT.
I SWEAR TO GOD, I'LL DO IT.
NO, BABY, PLEASE DON'T.

10:15.115 --> 10:17.748
YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME.
NOBODY DOES.

10:17.748 --> 10:19.890
SO NOW, I SWEAR TO GOD,
I'LL STAB MYSELF.

10:19.890 --> 10:22.022
HAYLEY, I'M DR. KAREV.
ALEX.

10:22.022 --> 10:25.125
I NEED YOU TO PUT THAT DOWN.
IT'LL KILL ME, RIGHT?

10:25.125 --> 10:28.829
IF I STUCK THIS IN MY HEART,
IT WOULD KILL ME, RIGHT?
YOU DON'T WANT
TO DO THAT, HAYLEY.

10:28.829 --> 10:31.131
'CAUSE THERE'S DRUGS IN HERE,
I WOULD DIE, RIGHT?

10:31.131 --> 10:33.403
TRUST ME.

10:33.403 --> 10:35.065
I CAN HELP YOU.

10:35.065 --> 10:37.738
I'M NOT CRAZY.

10:37.738 --> 10:41.141
I KNOW.
I-I... I BELIEVE YOU.

10:41.141 --> 10:43.143
EVERYONE OUTSIDE
THINKS YOU'RE CRAZY,

10:43.143 --> 10:45.045
BUT SOMETHING'S
GOING ON INSIDE,

10:45.045 --> 10:47.177
AND NONE OF US UNDERSTAND.

10:47.177 --> 10:49.179
SO WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT
WHAT THAT IS,

10:49.179 --> 10:53.183
AND THE ONLY WAY WE CAN DO THAT
IS IF YOU PUT THAT DOWN

10:53.183 --> 10:56.286
AND LET ME RUN SOME TESTS.
OKAY?

10:56.286 --> 10:59.429
YOU PROMISE?

10:59.429 --> 11:02.292
YES.

11:06.366 --> 11:11.041
JUST PUT IT DOWN.

11:11.041 --> 11:13.103
IT'S GONNA BE OKAY.

11:13.103 --> 11:15.305

11:21.151 --> 11:25.285

SOME TESTS ON HAYLEY.

11:44.935 --> 11:47.407
MORE TESTS? LOOK, WE--
WE'VE BEEN TO DOCTORS, OKAY?

11:47.407 --> 11:49.880
HAYLEY IS SCHIZOPHRENIC.
SHE WAS DIAGNOSED MONTHS AGO.

11:49.880 --> 11:51.882
KEN'S FATHER
WAS SCHIZOPHRENIC.

11:51.882 --> 11:54.214
HE KILLED HIMSELF
WHEN KEN WAS 8.
(Alex) LOOK, DR. SHEPHERD,

11:54.214 --> 11:57.217
IT'S JUST A FEW MORE TESTS,
AND--AND SHE WANTS THEM.

11:57.217 --> 12:00.851
MR. AND MRS. MAY, BELIEVE ME,
I UNDERSTAND YOUR FRUSTRATION.

12:00.851 --> 12:03.193

SOMETHING WAS MISSED.

12:03.193 --> 12:06.326
HONEY, PLEASE.

12:06.326 --> 12:08.128
FINE.
OKAY?

12:08.128 --> 12:09.830

AMBER AND TRISH.

12:19.239 --> 12:22.272

AMBER COLLIER, 28,

12:27.117 --> 12:28.949
PRESENTS STATUS POST-M.V.C.

12:28.949 --> 12:30.951
AMBER WAS IN A CAR
WHEN IT FLIPPED

12:30.951 --> 12:33.954
AND SHE WAS PINNED UNDER IT
WHILE IT BURNED.

12:33.954 --> 12:36.957
DRIVING WHILE TEXTING.
WE STRONGLY RECOMMEND IT.
(Mark) DR. AVERY,

12:36.957 --> 12:38.258
WILL YOU PLEASE EXPLAIN

12:38.258 --> 12:40.260
HOW WE'RE GONNA USE
A TISSUE EXPANDER?

12:40.260 --> 12:43.193
WE STRETCH HEALTHY TISSUE BY
INJECTING SALINE INTO A BALLOON

12:43.193 --> 12:44.494
PLACED UNDER THE SKULL.

12:44.494 --> 12:46.496
AND TODAY WE'LL REMOVE
THAT BURNED AREA

12:46.496 --> 12:48.939
AND COVER IT WITH NEW TISSUE.
YOU PROMISE THAT AFTERWARDS,

12:48.939 --> 12:51.001
IT WON'T LOOK LIKE
A COMB-OVER, RIGHT?

12:51.001 --> 12:53.804
I WILL DO MY BEST.

12:53.804 --> 12:56.276
DR. SLOAN, DR. BAILEY.

YOUR FINGERS LOOKED LIKE THIS?

THEY ALWAYS LOOK PRETTY BAD.

13:04.214 --> 13:06.887

MY SURGERY, RIGHT?

13:06.887 --> 13:10.560
WE'LL KNOW MORE AFTER WE GET
SOME FILMS ON THE FINGERS.

13:10.560 --> 13:14.024
Y-YOU'RE BUMMED OUT ABOUT
GETTING A COUPLE OF X-RAYS?

13:14.024 --> 13:16.927
YOU GOT A TWIN SISTER
GROWING OUT OF YOUR HEAD.

13:16.927 --> 13:19.029
THAT'S WHAT YOU SHOULD BE
BUMMED ABOUT.

13:19.029 --> 13:20.370

MY WIFE'S MAID OF HONOR.

13:33.513 --> 13:36.016

WRITE HER EVENTUALLY

"I COULDN'T STAND UP
IN YOUR WEDDING

13:46.927 --> 13:48.929
THERE WAS A PARTY.

13:48.929 --> 13:54.004
I-I-I REMEMBER, THE SKY
WAS SO CLEAR THAT NIGHT,

13:54.004 --> 13:56.306

13:56.306 --> 13:58.008

13:59.970 --> 14:03.243
HAPPENED.

YEAH, IRENE AND I WERE WAITING
FOR OUR WEDDING NIGHTS.

14:19.159 --> 14:22.162
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MY LIFE,
I FELT COMPLETE.

14:27.367 --> 14:30.300
I WANTED TO CALL OFF
THE ENGAGEMENT.

14:30.300 --> 14:33.273
WOULD'VE BEEN
A TERRIBLE SCANDAL.

14:33.273 --> 14:36.306
AND--AND IT WOULD'VE RUINED
MY FRIENDSHIP WITH IRENE.

14:36.306 --> 14:37.607
A--BUT OF COURSE,

14:37.607 --> 14:39.609

WAS RUINED ANYWAY.

14:39.609 --> 14:41.311

14:41.311 --> 14:45.085

ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND...

14:45.085 --> 14:47.187

14:47.187 --> 14:49.960
I MARRIED IRENE.

30:34.203 --> 30:37.006
AND I'M SO ANGRY
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED TO ME,

30:37.006 --> 30:40.409
THAT I CAN'T DRIVE MY CAR.

30:40.409 --> 30:42.541
FOR HOURS, I JUST SIT THERE.

30:42.541 --> 30:45.274
DOES THAT
EVER HAPPEN TO YOU...

30:45.274 --> 30:47.576
(voice breaks) THAT YOU'RE
SO ANGRY YOU CAN'T BREATHE?

30:47.576 --> 30:50.579
(normal voice) BECAUSE I DO.
BUT I CAN'T TELL YOU THAT

30:50.579 --> 30:56.585
BECAUSE I'M AFRAID I'M BEING...
WEAK OR UNGRATEFUL.

30:56.585 --> 31:01.360
PLEASE.
YOU ARE MY BEST FRIEND.

31:01.360 --> 31:03.362
HORRIBLE THINGS
HAVE HAPPENED TO US.

31:03.362 --> 31:07.266
CAN WE JUST BE REAL
WITH EACH OTHER FOR ONCE?

31:07.266 --> 31:09.138
(sighs)

31:15.144 --> 31:18.277
I CAN'T WATCH
ROMANTIC COMEDIES ANYMORE

31:18.277 --> 31:22.351
BECAUSE... I JUST WANT
TO YELL AT THE WOMEN,

31:22.351 --> 31:26.315
"YOU CAN'T FIND MR. RIGHT?
THAT'S YOUR BIGGEST PROBLEM?

31:26.315 --> 31:28.317
"WELL, TRY HAVING MOST OF
YOUR FACE BURNED OFF,

31:28.317 --> 31:30.019
"YOU STUPID, BITCH.

31:30.019 --> 31:33.522
SEE WHAT A FREAKIN'
PRETTY WOMAN YOU ARE THEN."

31:35.494 --> 31:36.665
(laughs)

31:36.665 --> 31:40.269
(laughs) I DON'T KNOW.

31:40.269 --> 31:42.471
THANK YOU.
OH, NO.

31:42.471 --> 31:44.934
OH. (laughs)

31:48.978 --> 31:50.479
CRISTINA LOVES YOU,

31:50.479 --> 31:52.481
AND I WANT TO,
BUT I CAN'T

31:52.481 --> 31:54.984
BECAUSE I WANT TO PUNCH YOU
IN THE FACE RIGHT NOW.

31:54.984 --> 31:57.316
I KNOW YOU TRIED
TO HAVE TEDDY FIRED.

31:57.316 --> 31:59.318
AND I BELIEVE
IT'S BECAUSE YOU LOVE HER.

31:59.318 --> 32:02.521
AND IF YOU CARE ABOUT CRISTINA
AT ALL, YOU WILL TELL HER.

32:02.521 --> 32:05.524
IF YOU'RE ACTUALLY THE GOOD GUY
THAT SHE THINKS YOU ARE,

32:05.524 --> 32:07.226
YOU WILL TELL HER.

32:07.226 --> 32:09.959
AND IF YOU DON'T,
THEN I'LL KNOW

32:09.959 --> 32:13.332
AND YOU'LL KNOW
THAT YOU ARE NOT THAT GUY.

32:24.673 --> 32:26.275
(exhales deeply)

32:26.275 --> 32:28.547
LOOK, TEDDY...

32:28.547 --> 32:31.120
I WANTED TO SAY THAT--

32:31.120 --> 32:33.452
LOOK, I SHOULD'VE KNOCKED.
IT'S--IT'S THAT SIMPLE.

32:33.452 --> 32:35.454
AND IT'S THAT OVER.

32:38.127 --> 32:40.559
TALK TO HER.
I JUST DID.
SHE DOESN'T WANT TO.

32:40.559 --> 32:43.192
NO, I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT TEDDY.
I'M TALKING ABOUT LEXIE.

32:43.192 --> 32:44.493
YOU STILL LOVE LEXIE,

32:44.493 --> 32:47.436
AND SLEEPING AROUND
ISN'T GONNA FIX THAT.

32:47.436 --> 32:49.438
AND THE REASONS
THAT YOU BROKE UP--

32:49.438 --> 32:51.540
LITTLE SLOAN AND THE BABY--
THEY'RE NOT REASONS ANYMORE.

32:51.540 --> 32:54.373
SHE'S WITH KAREV.
YEAH, WELL,
BETTY MARRIED MIKE,

32:54.373 --> 32:57.046
BUT SHE NEVER GOT OVER HENRY.

32:57.046 --> 32:58.207
WHAT?

32:58.207 --> 33:00.409
LOOK, YOU DON'T WANT
50 YEARS TO GO BY

33:00.409 --> 33:03.212
AND THEN REALIZE THAT YOU LET
THE LOVE OF YOUR LIFE GET AWAY.

33:03.212 --> 33:05.214
SO GO. TRY.

33:05.214 --> 33:07.986
YOU GONNA TRY AGAIN
WITH ROBBINS?

33:07.986 --> 33:10.319
(sighs)

33:10.319 --> 33:12.161
WHY NOT?

33:12.161 --> 33:15.394
BECAUSE MY REASONS
ARE STILL REASONS.

33:21.770 --> 33:23.772
LOOK, I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

33:23.772 --> 33:26.635
YOU TOLD SHEPHERD TO HIRE
DR. EVANS OVER TEDDY?

33:26.635 --> 33:28.577
WHEN I ASKED YOU
TO GO TO BAT FOR HER,

33:28.577 --> 33:31.380
YOU SAID THAT YOU DID, SO...

33:31.380 --> 33:32.581
(sighs)

33:34.483 --> 33:36.685
MEREDITH SAID...

33:38.687 --> 33:41.650
OWEN, WHAT'S GOING ON
BETWEEN YOU AND TEDDY?

33:41.650 --> 33:46.055
OH, NOTHING.
NOTHING IS--GOD.

33:46.055 --> 33:48.327
YOU WANT ME TO GET BETTER.

33:48.327 --> 33:51.029
I WANT ME TO GET BETTER.
AND I HAVE BEEN WORKING.

33:51.029 --> 33:53.031
I HAVE BEEN WORKING
WITH DR. WYATT

33:53.031 --> 33:55.033
TO ELIMINATE MY TRIGGERS--

33:55.033 --> 33:57.035
OKAY, SO--SO--
SO TEDDY'S A TRIGGER?

33:57.035 --> 33:59.408
TEDDY--I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TEDDY IS.

33:59.408 --> 34:02.571
TEDDY--SHE TRIGGERS ME,
SHE CONFUSES ME.

34:02.571 --> 34:05.074
I-I-I DON'T KNOW.
OKAY, WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT?

34:05.074 --> 34:09.318
"I DON'T KNOW" IS NOT
WORKING FOR ME RIGHT NOW.
I DON'T KNOW
IS ALL I'VE GOT.

34:09.318 --> 34:12.151
I SHOULDN'T HAVE TO
EXPLAIN MYSELF TO--
OH?

34:12.151 --> 34:14.323
(exhales deeply)
CRISTINA...

34:16.525 --> 34:21.130
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I FEEL FOR TEDDY.

34:21.130 --> 34:22.431
I DON'T KNOW

34:22.431 --> 34:24.433
BECAUSE SHE'S ALL WRAPPED UP
WITH EVERYTHING ELSE--

34:24.433 --> 34:27.436
WITH MEN BEING BLOWN APART
IN FRONT OF ME, WITH BETH.

34:27.436 --> 34:30.299
SO IT'S COMPLICATED AND IT IS
SCREWING WITH MY HEAD.

34:30.299 --> 34:33.142
THAT'S THE TRUTH. I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I FEEL FOR HER.

34:33.142 --> 34:35.144
BUT I DO KNOW
WHAT I FEEL FOR YOU.

34:35.144 --> 34:38.477
SO, YES, I TOLD SHEPHERD
TO HIRE THE OTHER GUY.

34:38.477 --> 34:40.779
AND I SHOULDN'T HAVE TO
EXPLAIN MYSELF...
HOW--OH.

34:40.779 --> 34:43.482
SO I CAN GET MYSELF BETTER.
HOW COULD YOU
HAVE DONE THAT TO--

34:43.482 --> 34:45.554
I SHOULDN'T HAVE TO EXPLAIN
MYSELF TO YOU

34:45.554 --> 34:48.287
AND I DAMN WELL DO NOT
HAVE TO EXPLAIN MYSELF

34:48.287 --> 34:50.289
TO MEREDITH GREY.

34:50.289 --> 34:52.591
(pager beeps)

34:52.591 --> 34:55.164
(beep)

34:58.797 --> 35:01.500
IT'S, UH...

35:01.500 --> 35:03.502
IT'S HENRY STAMM.

35:07.506 --> 35:11.180
(monitor beeping erratically)
HE WAS TALKING TO ME,

35:11.180 --> 35:13.282
AND THEN HE COULDN'T BREATHE.
ARTERIAL FLUTTER AGAIN.

35:13.282 --> 35:15.444
CRISTINA,
GET HER OUT OF HERE.
MA'AM, I NEED TO MOVE YOU.

35:15.444 --> 35:18.547
(Betty)
NO, I'M NOT LEAVING HIM.
SYSTOLIC'S 80.
WE'RE GONNA NEED TO CARDIOVERT.

35:18.547 --> 35:21.220
(Teddy) MM-HMM.
CHARGE PADDLES TO 100.

35:21.220 --> 35:23.622
(woman) CHARGING.
YOU WANT TO HELP HIM?
LET GO OF HIS HAND.

35:23.622 --> 35:25.624
OH, GOD.
(defibrillator whines,
paddles thunk)

35:33.262 --> 35:37.236
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

35:37.236 --> 35:40.369
HELLO. YOUR HEART RHYTHM
WAS IRREGULAR AGAIN.

35:40.369 --> 35:42.771
WE WERE ABLE
TO CONTROL IT FOR NOW,

35:42.771 --> 35:44.773
BUT WE'RE GONNA NEED
TO INSERT A PACEMAKER

35:44.773 --> 35:47.316
BEFORE YOU GO HOME.
YOU'RE GONNA BE OKAY.

35:47.316 --> 35:49.618
I'VE CALLED A COLLEAGUE
AT YOUR HOSPITAL AT HOME,

35:49.618 --> 35:52.421
AND HE'LL SEE YOU
ONCE WE CLEAR YOU TO TRAVEL.

35:52.421 --> 35:55.524
THANK YOU.
(sighs)

35:55.524 --> 35:57.386
YOU STAYED?

35:57.386 --> 35:59.428
YOU CAN'T DO THAT AGAIN.

35:59.428 --> 36:02.591
IF I'M GONNA MOVE
HALFWAY ACROSS THE COUNTRY

36:02.591 --> 36:04.763
TO SHACK UP WITH YOU...

36:04.763 --> 36:08.297
(voice breaking)
YOU CAN'T DO THAT AGAIN.
REALLY?

36:08.297 --> 36:10.599
(sniffles) YOU...
YOU MAKE ME FEEL

36:10.599 --> 36:12.941
LIKE THE PRETTIEST GIRL
AT THE PARTY.

36:12.941 --> 36:16.375
WHEN YOU LOOK AT ME,
I BECOME A YOUNG GIRL AGAIN.

36:16.375 --> 36:19.878
AND I NEVER STOPPED MISSING YOU,
AND I NEVER STOPPED WONDERING.

36:19.878 --> 36:22.251
I DID THE RIGHT THING ONCE.

36:22.251 --> 36:24.513
NOW I'D LIKE TO DO
THE WRONG THING

36:24.513 --> 36:27.386
AND SEE HOW THAT GOES.

36:28.757 --> 36:32.791
HOW LONG DO YOU NEED ME
TO WAIT BEFORE I PROPOSE?

36:32.791 --> 36:35.794
(beeping continues)

36:41.470 --> 36:42.431
CRISTINA--

36:42.431 --> 36:43.972
DON'T.

36:46.435 --> 36:50.479
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

36:50.479 --> 36:51.780
SHE'S STARTING TO WAKE UP.

36:51.780 --> 36:53.782
REMEMBER, WE'RE GONNA
TAKE IT SLOWLY

36:53.782 --> 36:55.484
AND SEE HOW IT GOES.

36:55.484 --> 36:58.517
THERE'S NO GUARANTEE
THAT THE SURGERY WORKED.

36:58.517 --> 37:01.850
(beeping continues)

37:01.850 --> 37:03.522
(exhales)

37:03.522 --> 37:06.595
HOW YOU DOING, HAYLEY?

37:06.595 --> 37:08.727
(whispers) I'M GOOD.

37:16.805 --> 37:18.467
I'M GOOD.

37:23.011 --> 37:26.345
I'M GOOD.

37:26.345 --> 37:29.948
OH, MY GOD.
I'M GOOD.

37:29.948 --> 37:32.551
I'M GOOD!

37:32.551 --> 37:35.554
ASK MOST PEOPLE
WHAT THEY WANT OUT OF LIFE,

37:35.554 --> 37:38.256
AND THE ANSWER'S SIMPLE...

37:38.256 --> 37:40.489
TO BE HAPPY.

37:42.331 --> 37:44.463
MAYBE IT'S
THIS EXPECTATION, THOUGH,

37:44.463 --> 37:47.035
THE WANTING TO BE HAPPY...

37:47.035 --> 37:50.439
THAT JUST KEEPS US
FROM EVER GETTING THERE.

37:50.439 --> 37:52.441
I NEED TO TALK TO YOU.

37:52.441 --> 37:53.702
HEY, I GET IT.

37:53.702 --> 37:55.704
YOU WANT TO SEE
OTHER PEOPLE.

37:55.704 --> 37:57.676
SO GO. BE FREE.

37:57.676 --> 37:59.678
GET CHEEKY WITH LIZ.

37:59.678 --> 38:01.750
LIZ IS THE MEANEST NURSE
ON THE FLOOR.

38:01.750 --> 38:04.453
SHE MAKES EVERYBODY
IN MY DEPARTMENT'S LIFE HELL.

38:04.453 --> 38:06.054
BUT SHE LIKES ME.

38:06.054 --> 38:08.587
SHE DOESN'T SCHEDULE ME
FOR WORK ON TUESDAY MORNINGS

38:08.587 --> 38:10.559
BECAUSE SHE KNOWS
THAT'S WHEN I PLAY GOLF.

38:10.559 --> 38:13.061
SHE DOESN'T PUT ME IN THE O.R.
WITH HENDRICKS BECAUSE SHE KNOWS

38:13.061 --> 38:15.764
I CAN'T STAND THE WAY HE TALKS
TO HIMSELF WHEN HE OPERATES.

38:15.764 --> 38:17.766
AND SHE DOES THESE FAVORS FOR ME
BECAUSE I FLIRT WITH HER.

38:17.766 --> 38:20.329
FLIRTING MAKES MY JOB EASIER.

38:20.329 --> 38:23.332
AND WHAT YOU SAW BACK THERE,
THAT--THAT MIDDLE NAME STUFF?

38:23.332 --> 38:26.735
THAT'S BAD FLIRTING,
LAZY FLIRTING.

38:26.735 --> 38:30.439
FOR YOU,
WHO I ACTUALLY LIKE...

38:30.439 --> 38:33.542
I BREAK OUT MY GOOD FLIRTING,
MY A-GAME...

38:33.542 --> 38:35.784
BECAUSE I MEAN IT.

38:35.784 --> 38:37.786
ARE YOU HEARING ME, MIRANDA?

38:37.786 --> 38:40.819
I... I MEAN IT.

38:43.992 --> 38:45.994
(voice breaking)
I HAVE A CHILD...

38:45.994 --> 38:47.956
AND A FULL-TIME JOB.

38:47.956 --> 38:51.430
AND I'M GOING THROUGH
A SAD...

38:51.430 --> 38:55.033
EXHAUSTING, STRESSFUL,
TIME-CONSUMING DIVORCE.

38:55.033 --> 38:57.035
I DON'T HAVE TIME FOR GAMES.

38:57.035 --> 38:59.568

YOU UNDERSTAND THAT, RIGHT?

38:59.568 --> 39:01.069
I DO.

39:01.069 --> 39:03.642
I DO, AND I'M NOT--
