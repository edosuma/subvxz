WEBVTT

00:02.576 --> 00:04.309
And, uh, one last
signature here.

00:06.646 --> 00:08.379
Congratulations.

00:08.381 --> 00:11.014
We are official part
owners of the bar!

00:11.016 --> 00:12.815
Ah! SCHMIDT: Yes!

00:12.817 --> 00:14.216
Sir, we won't
let you down.

00:14.218 --> 00:15.684
I'm just a notary.

00:15.686 --> 00:17.185
Hey, the note... arize.

00:17.187 --> 00:19.086
All right, we're not gonna
let you down.

00:21.023 --> 00:24.090
It's gonna be a little weird,
you know, me working for you.

00:24.092 --> 00:25.658
No, no, babe. We're
gonna keep it separate.

00:25.660 --> 00:27.226
Ass-Strat's my day job.

00:27.228 --> 00:28.427
I'm more of a
"show up late night

00:28.429 --> 00:30.061
with my Argentinian friends"
type of owner.

00:30.063 --> 00:33.264
Nick's in charge. He's got it.
Okay.

00:33.266 --> 00:34.598
Look, it's all about finesse.
Watch.

00:34.600 --> 00:36.199
The trick is,
is you get super close,

00:36.201 --> 00:37.667
but then you pull back.

00:37.669 --> 00:39.502
Watch how Daddy does it.

00:39.504 --> 00:41.103
Oh, no!

00:41.105 --> 00:42.938
(Javier laughs) NICK: Thank you
for the back pat. I needed that.

00:42.940 --> 00:44.439
What?

00:44.441 --> 00:45.873
You have to have beer
on the bar,  Uh-huh.

00:45.875 --> 00:47.074
because that's
what makes it stick.

00:47.076 --> 00:48.608
So now I can do it
a billion times on it.

00:48.610 --> 00:50.209
Don't count that first one.

00:50.211 --> 00:51.710
Don't count that first one.
Okay. Hey.

00:51.712 --> 00:53.244
Look at that.
What a game, right?

00:53.246 --> 00:55.079
Screw the boss?
Oh, wait. That's you.

00:55.081 --> 00:57.181
It's up to you
to take charge now.

00:57.183 --> 00:59.216
Oh, yeah,
'cause I'm the manager.

00:59.218 --> 01:01.251
What you need to do
is set a meeting.

01:01.253 --> 01:04.120
Establish yourself
as a leader.

01:04.122 --> 01:06.422
Within every man
there is a man... ager.

01:06.424 --> 01:08.257
What's-what's
going on there?

01:08.259 --> 01:09.524
What do you mean?

01:09.526 --> 01:11.692
Your rib cage has give.

01:11.694 --> 01:13.226
You know, KC still hasn't
texted me back.

01:13.228 --> 01:15.294
I've been on five dates
with her-- five dates,

01:15.296 --> 01:16.528
and I still don't
know where I stand.

01:16.530 --> 01:18.630
New relationships are so hard!

01:18.632 --> 01:20.632
They take so much work.

01:20.634 --> 01:22.300
So much work. It's like...

01:22.302 --> 01:25.636
it's like making a risotto;
a risotto in your heart.

01:25.638 --> 01:27.471
Mm.
Hmm.

01:27.473 --> 01:29.639
Aw. What's that for?

01:29.641 --> 01:31.307
Just 'cause.

01:31.309 --> 01:33.275
Aw.
Mmm.

01:33.277 --> 01:35.277
How great is that?

01:35.279 --> 01:36.911
So great.  JESS:
So comfy, so warm.

01:36.913 --> 01:38.445
Like a port in the storm.

01:38.447 --> 01:40.947
I just want to skip
all the first dates,

01:40.949 --> 01:42.248
and just get to this.

01:42.250 --> 01:43.649
Mm-hmm. You're gonna
get there, okay?

01:43.651 --> 01:46.118
You just got to...
got to keep yourself open.

01:46.120 --> 01:48.954
Wasn't Sadie gonna hook you up
with, uh, that guy?

01:48.956 --> 01:52.290
Oh, yeah, Fred. He invited me
to watch a movie-- at his house.

01:52.292 --> 01:53.724
During the day.

01:53.726 --> 01:55.258
Doesn't that make it sound like

01:55.260 --> 01:56.892
he's a boy
who's allergic to everything?

01:56.894 --> 01:58.326
You're looking
for something wrong.

01:58.328 --> 02:00.094
I got to say, she's right.
Mm-hmm.

02:00.096 --> 02:02.963
And besides, what if he's
got a dope-ass home theater?

02:03.932 --> 02:06.098
Damn!

02:06.100 --> 02:08.600
This is a dope-ass
home theater.

02:08.602 --> 02:09.901
(laughs)

02:09.903 --> 02:12.270
I'm gonna hit the
bathroom real quick.

02:12.272 --> 02:14.939
Okay. Well, hurry back before
previews begin. (laughs)

02:14.941 --> 02:17.942
That was a joke, 'cause I feel
like I'm in a real theater here.

02:17.944 --> 02:19.777
I mean, this is amazing.
Thank you.

02:19.779 --> 02:21.345
Thank you for inviting me.

02:23.282 --> 02:26.149
Oh, that was fast.
Hi. Didn't mean to startle.

02:26.151 --> 02:27.517
Just wanted to
know if you wanted

02:27.519 --> 02:28.784
some snacks
during the movie.

02:28.786 --> 02:30.752
I've just made a fresh
pot of coffee.

02:30.754 --> 02:33.154
We're Flip and Nancy.

02:33.156 --> 02:35.289
Fred's parents.
Mm.

02:35.291 --> 02:38.125
Oh! (chuckles)

02:38.127 --> 02:40.327
Fred lives with his parents.

02:40.329 --> 02:42.295
Now I see
where he gets his looks.

02:42.297 --> 02:44.964
And his house. (chuckles)

02:44.966 --> 02:46.665
♪ ♪

02:48.635 --> 02:50.134
Guys, seriously.

02:50.136 --> 02:51.702
I'm... I'm not hungry.

02:51.704 --> 02:54.137
You can't watch the movie
on an empty stomach.

02:54.139 --> 02:56.005
Hey, cool your jets until
you have some of our coffee.

02:56.007 --> 02:57.706
Beans are from Portland.

02:57.708 --> 03:00.141
Oh, that's funny. (chuckles)
I'm from Portland.

03:00.143 --> 03:02.376
Do you know my last book signing
was at Powell's Books?

03:02.378 --> 03:03.944
Oh, no way.
You're-you're a writer?

03:03.946 --> 03:06.012
Well, I'm just a fool
with a few stories.

03:06.014 --> 03:07.947
Oh, you're just
being modest.

03:07.949 --> 03:10.282
And you are being lovely. Oh.

03:11.785 --> 03:13.551
(giggles)

03:13.553 --> 03:15.519
You guys are so sweet together.

03:15.521 --> 03:17.521
That's because we're still
on our honeymoon.

03:17.523 --> 03:19.389
35 wonderful years
of marriage.

03:19.391 --> 03:21.224
Feels like two to me. Oh.

03:21.226 --> 03:23.192
NANCY: Feels like one.
FLIP: Like we just met.

03:23.194 --> 03:25.060
CECE:
<i> Nick, what are we doing here?</i>

03:25.062 --> 03:26.828
(laughter)

03:26.830 --> 03:28.396
(both clear throats)

03:28.398 --> 03:30.030
Each-each of you know me.

03:30.032 --> 03:31.364
Yeah.

03:31.366 --> 03:34.166
If you don't,
my name is Nicholas Miller.

03:34.168 --> 03:35.534
I'm an American
from Chicago.

03:35.536 --> 03:39.037
I'm your new boss,
so you'll do what I say.

03:39.039 --> 03:41.539
When the cave people
went to the cave bar,

03:41.541 --> 03:43.741
and they asked
for a drink on the rocks,

03:43.743 --> 03:45.642
they actually meant it.
(laughs)

03:45.644 --> 03:47.710
Now that we're all laughing...

03:51.248 --> 03:53.614
It says, "Wait for laughs."

03:55.250 --> 03:57.984
(sighs) I...

03:57.986 --> 03:59.652
Anybody have any questions?

03:59.654 --> 04:00.753
I have a question.

04:00.755 --> 04:01.553
Please. Anything.

04:01.555 --> 04:02.987
Your mother.

04:02.989 --> 04:05.823
(laughter)

04:05.825 --> 04:07.658
Your mother. I love it.

04:07.660 --> 04:09.092
Thank you
for breaking the ice.

04:09.094 --> 04:10.359
I know!
(laughter)

04:10.361 --> 04:12.694
I must look so stupid!

04:12.696 --> 04:15.196
"Hey, get over here.
I got a meeting."

04:15.198 --> 04:17.064
What an idiot, huh?

04:18.233 --> 04:19.365
It was that bad, huh?

04:19.367 --> 04:20.866
No,<i> Birdman</i> was bad.

04:20.868 --> 04:23.001
This... this was a disaster.

04:23.003 --> 04:25.570
I'm here to help you, okay?
Look, I have over nearly

04:25.572 --> 04:27.204
ten years of experience
in the corporate world.

04:27.206 --> 04:28.371
What's "over nearly ten"?

04:28.373 --> 04:30.206
"Nearly ten" would be
eight or nine years.

04:30.208 --> 04:31.874
I have... I have
over nine years.

04:31.876 --> 04:33.775
That's different, yeah.

04:33.777 --> 04:35.610
Got you a tie.
Corporate 101.

04:35.612 --> 04:37.878
Dress better than
your employees.

04:37.880 --> 04:39.379
Reminds them that
they're inferior.

04:39.381 --> 04:41.581
I'd wear a tie,
but only on my butt,

04:41.583 --> 04:43.049
like it were a tail.

04:43.051 --> 04:45.451
A tail tie.

04:45.453 --> 04:47.586
Furguson, you have a knot!

04:47.588 --> 04:49.287
That salt water in here?

04:49.289 --> 04:51.222
You been hanging
down at the wharf again?

04:51.224 --> 04:52.890
Guess what.

04:52.892 --> 04:55.425
I took a chance with that
guy Fred, and I'm in love.

04:55.427 --> 04:56.459
That's incredible.

04:56.461 --> 04:58.427
With his parents,
but I'm in love!

04:58.429 --> 05:01.863
Furguson, clear my schedule.

05:02.432 --> 05:04.665
I need a word with your sister.

05:09.938 --> 05:11.304
When Nancy was in Zimbabwe
building clean water systems,

05:11.306 --> 05:13.306
Flip dropped everything to go
over there and be with her,

05:13.308 --> 05:14.273
and they put Fred
in tribal school.

05:14.275 --> 05:15.907
You seem like you're on cocaine.

05:15.909 --> 05:18.476
Yeah, right. Flip and
Nancy and I hate drugs.

05:18.478 --> 05:20.277
Okay, yeah, great.
What do you like about Fred?

05:20.279 --> 05:22.245
Well, I didn't really
get any time with him,

05:22.247 --> 05:24.447
'cause Flip and Nancy
wanted to watch the sunset.

05:24.449 --> 05:26.248
Hey, do not talk to me
like I'm some bastard

05:26.250 --> 05:27.482
who doesn't enjoy a good sunset.

05:27.484 --> 05:30.485
But if you really want
to be in a relationship...

05:30.487 --> 05:33.621
Then I have to get to know
Fred. Ha! You know what?

05:33.623 --> 05:36.423
Tomorrow, I'm gonna just crack
him open like a cold beer.

05:36.425 --> 05:38.057
You know what's a good date?
Hmm?

05:38.059 --> 05:40.225
Errands and a smoothie.

05:41.261 --> 05:42.693
Okay, everyone,
listen up.

05:44.630 --> 05:46.429
Here are your
new uniforms.

05:46.431 --> 05:48.464
Oh, you got to be kidding.

05:48.466 --> 05:50.265
(Cece groans) Save your
groans for<i> Birdman!</i>

05:50.267 --> 05:53.268
From now on, we will
measure drinks.

05:53.270 --> 05:54.469
Oh, man.

05:54.471 --> 05:56.270
And we have a new
one-napkin policy.

05:56.272 --> 05:57.271
Just one napkin?

05:57.273 --> 05:59.473
Questions at
the end, please.

05:59.475 --> 06:02.309
Should somebody ask you
for a second napkin,

06:02.311 --> 06:04.277
you just say,
"Are you sure?"

06:04.279 --> 06:07.179
Nine times out of ten, they'll
just back off and say, "Thanks."

06:07.181 --> 06:09.147
Now please go try
on your new polos.

06:09.149 --> 06:11.516
(all groaning, murmuring)

06:11.518 --> 06:13.084
Can I have a word with you?

06:13.086 --> 06:14.318
Hey, Schmidt,
everything you just said

06:14.320 --> 06:16.520
makes me want to give you
a wedgie in front of the others.

06:16.522 --> 06:20.323
You need to rule with
an iron fist. No mercy.

06:20.325 --> 06:22.758
You're not suggesting
Cobra Kai rules?

06:22.760 --> 06:25.994
I'm not doing it!
They're my friends!

06:25.996 --> 06:28.329
Your<i> friends</i> are
gonna lose their jobs

06:28.331 --> 06:30.364
if this bar goes under.

06:33.135 --> 06:34.334
Ooh!

06:34.336 --> 06:36.502
I never thought
I would say this, but...

06:36.504 --> 06:37.603
give me the tie.

06:37.605 --> 06:40.305
Now we're talking.

06:40.307 --> 06:41.339
No mercy.

06:41.341 --> 06:43.607
Corporate leader is born.

06:45.177 --> 06:47.210
Don't-don't put it
around your head.

06:47.212 --> 06:50.379
Well, hello to you. Hi.
Hi!

06:50.381 --> 06:52.547
Fred'll be right down.
You know, Nan and I are just

06:52.549 --> 06:54.615
packing up some books and paints
for a park day!

06:54.617 --> 06:56.149
A park day?!

06:56.151 --> 06:58.184
Yes, it's from when we
used to live in Paris.

06:58.186 --> 06:59.552
You should come!

06:59.554 --> 07:01.220
Well, look, um,

07:01.222 --> 07:02.554
I would love to, uh,

07:02.556 --> 07:04.689
but, um, I have to, uh,

07:04.691 --> 07:07.224
spend a little one-on-one time
with, uh, this one.

07:07.226 --> 07:09.459
When can chill with my parents.
Okay.

07:09.461 --> 07:10.693
Yes!
Oh! Great!

07:10.695 --> 07:12.094
Here's some paint.
Coffee?

07:13.397 --> 07:15.463
I feel like
a car rental agent.

07:15.465 --> 07:17.565
Yeah, well, you look
like a prince.

07:17.567 --> 07:20.200
Now, go. Go be a boss.

07:20.202 --> 07:21.267
Hey, Cece.

07:22.403 --> 07:24.703
Um, we measure our drinks now.

07:24.705 --> 07:25.837
Am I right?

07:25.839 --> 07:28.573
So, uh, do as I say.

07:28.575 --> 07:31.208
(laughs)
Of course. Use the thing.

07:31.210 --> 07:32.809
Sorry, just, you know,
it's important.

07:32.811 --> 07:35.578
You know, with the...
consist...

07:35.580 --> 07:38.814
Is this the exact thing that
you wanted to have happen?

07:38.816 --> 07:41.649
I wouldn't want to get
anything on my new uniform.

07:43.586 --> 07:45.218
That's, like, six shots.

07:45.220 --> 07:47.053
So you have to charge...

07:47.055 --> 07:48.387
That was some sass.

07:48.389 --> 07:50.589
You're at a real
crossroads here.

07:50.591 --> 07:52.390
This is a big
moment for you.

07:52.392 --> 07:55.059
There is no fear
in this dojo!

07:55.061 --> 07:57.428
NICK:
Hey, Javier?

07:57.430 --> 07:58.595
Where's-where's your shirt?

07:58.597 --> 08:00.163
Oh, it's so crazy, Nick.

08:00.165 --> 08:02.431
Someone broke into
my house last night

08:02.433 --> 08:04.232
and stole that ugly shirt.

08:04.234 --> 08:05.399
(chuckles):
Yeah...

08:07.202 --> 08:09.435
I don't believe that.

08:09.437 --> 08:10.869
Oh, it's boxy on me, dude.

08:10.871 --> 08:14.606
As your boss... Javier,
I need you to put your shirt on.

08:14.608 --> 08:17.041
I need<i> you</i> to put it
on... your mother.

08:17.043 --> 08:18.442
(chuckles)

08:18.444 --> 08:19.609
Hey, no mother jokes.

08:19.611 --> 08:21.744
Javier, do not slide that
right now, okay?

08:21.746 --> 08:23.512
I mean it. Do not...

08:24.248 --> 08:26.514
You're fired.

08:27.183 --> 08:29.316
What?
Whoa, what?

08:31.687 --> 08:33.253
You changed, man.

08:33.255 --> 08:36.856
That is some Jeffrey
Tambor stuff, dude.

08:36.858 --> 08:38.457
Javier, wait.

08:38.459 --> 08:39.958
I-It's...
Look, I wouldn't get...

08:39.960 --> 08:41.759
Wait, wait, whoa, whoa, whoa.

08:41.761 --> 08:44.394
You just fired Javier?

08:44.396 --> 08:45.762
You are out of
control, Miller.

08:45.764 --> 08:47.063
I'm not gonna
take it anymore,

08:47.065 --> 08:48.064
and you guys
shouldn't, either.

08:48.066 --> 08:49.432
Okay, let's
show management

08:49.434 --> 08:52.768
exactly what we think of
their policies. Let's walk!

08:52.770 --> 08:54.469
I'm sorry, bae, you're gonna
have to keep it separate.

08:54.471 --> 08:55.636
Totally get it. Love you, bae.

08:55.638 --> 08:57.503
All right. Let's go.

09:00.407 --> 09:02.440
That was bad.

09:02.442 --> 09:05.476
But can we just take a
moment to appreciate Cece?

09:05.478 --> 09:07.411
I mean, the effect that
she has on people--

09:07.413 --> 09:08.445
it's really incredible.

09:08.447 --> 09:10.647
I can't believe...
she's marrying me.

09:10.649 --> 09:14.083
I mean... like,<i> what?</i>

09:14.085 --> 09:16.318
Boy, Furguson,
this knot is getting worse.

09:16.320 --> 09:17.485
(chuckles)

09:17.487 --> 09:18.986
We are in a hairy situation,
my friend.

09:18.988 --> 09:21.922
(forced laughter)

09:21.924 --> 09:23.623
JESS (laughing):
I know! Really!

09:23.625 --> 09:24.657
Oh, it's just,
it's just you!

09:24.659 --> 09:25.658
(laughter)

09:25.660 --> 09:27.459
JESS:
Hey, Winston.

09:27.461 --> 09:29.093
This is Nancy and Flip and, um...
Hi!

09:29.095 --> 09:31.295
And, uh, we just went
to the park, and we had

09:31.297 --> 09:33.463
a great park day, and we're
gonna have Nice to see you.

09:33.465 --> 09:35.097
some, uh, wine before dinner.

09:35.099 --> 09:36.131
Oh. And it's gonna be awesome.

09:36.133 --> 09:37.432
Oh, you should
join us.

09:37.434 --> 09:38.767
Oh. Yeah.
Yeah, come on!

09:38.768 --> 09:40.101
JESS: You should join us.
FLIP: A little sip.

09:40.103 --> 09:41.502
You should.  JESS:
Oh, yeah, for sure.

09:41.504 --> 09:42.636
Definitely join us.
Join us.

09:42.638 --> 09:44.571
Jess, a moment?

09:44.573 --> 09:45.738
Jess, what the hell
are you doing?

09:45.740 --> 09:47.506
They're just the most
amazing people I've ever met.

09:47.508 --> 09:49.074
What happened to the
one-on-one with Fred?

09:49.076 --> 09:51.676
He's just so quiet;
I can't get a read on him.

09:51.678 --> 09:53.944
Jess... if you want
a comfy, old relationship,

09:53.946 --> 09:55.512
you got to start somewhere.

09:55.514 --> 09:59.248
All right? Go spend five
minutes alone with him,<i> now.</i>

09:59.250 --> 10:00.916
Go get some cheese for the wine.

10:00.918 --> 10:02.350
Chevre is always nice.

10:02.352 --> 10:04.685
But I wouldn't dare tell
you how to buy cheese.

10:04.687 --> 10:07.320
You're being so assertive right
now. It's almost attractive.

10:07.322 --> 10:09.889
Hey, not now. Not the time.

10:14.595 --> 10:17.128
You know...

10:17.130 --> 10:20.531
I can be shy sometimes, too.

10:20.533 --> 10:22.299
You don't have
to be shy.

10:22.301 --> 10:26.435
Seriously, I-I'd really
like to get to know you.

10:27.504 --> 10:29.370
Really?

10:31.140 --> 10:33.473
Here's something that I learned
from our relationship.

10:33.475 --> 10:36.609
When you feel
a knot...

10:36.611 --> 10:38.277
you take a deep breath

10:38.279 --> 10:40.712
and you stare
at it and face it

10:40.714 --> 10:43.548
without fear
or judgment.

10:43.550 --> 10:46.684
I don't think that it's Furgy's
knot that's bothering you.

10:46.686 --> 10:48.385
Ooh.

10:48.387 --> 10:50.120
I think that the knot
that's bothering you

10:50.122 --> 10:51.521
is right there.

10:51.523 --> 10:52.855
(sighs)

10:52.857 --> 10:55.557
Uh, wow, I, um...

10:55.559 --> 10:57.859
I don't know
where I stand with my girl,

10:57.861 --> 11:00.695
and I can't talk to her,
because I am ashamed.

11:00.697 --> 11:01.862
Aw... Did he just
say "ashamed"?

11:01.864 --> 11:03.563
Yeah, that's what I said.
Ashamed...

11:03.565 --> 11:05.531
of being beautiful?
Of being a man?

11:05.533 --> 11:07.499
Of being passionate?

11:07.501 --> 11:09.868
Ha! Then I'm ashamed, too.

11:09.870 --> 11:11.502
I say to you...

11:11.504 --> 11:12.736
let her in.

11:12.738 --> 11:13.570
(quietly):
Yes.

11:13.572 --> 11:15.138
All together now.

11:15.140 --> 11:17.907
On the count of three? Oh.
Let her in.

11:17.909 --> 11:18.741
Let her in.
No counting.

11:18.743 --> 11:19.742
Okay, just go.

11:19.744 --> 11:21.210
FRED:
What a wonderful cheese store.

11:21.212 --> 11:22.578
They had so many options.

11:22.580 --> 11:24.413
That's good,
'cause I love cheese.

11:24.415 --> 11:25.981
All kinds of cheese.

11:25.983 --> 11:27.983
Orange cheese, pizza cheese.

11:27.985 --> 11:30.185
I love all parts of pizzas,
especially the dough.

11:30.187 --> 11:33.354
Once I asked for a ball of
dough, and they gave it to me,

11:33.356 --> 11:35.656
and I took it to a park
and ate it.

11:35.658 --> 11:36.990
I'm so glad
you opened up.

11:36.992 --> 11:39.392
But then I realized
I needed some sauce...

11:39.394 --> 11:40.726
(laughter)

11:40.728 --> 11:43.395
People always make fun
of my eyes,

11:43.397 --> 11:45.397
but I guess they're...
Oh-ho! Good!

11:45.399 --> 11:46.931
Winston, can I
have a moment?

11:46.933 --> 11:48.632
(quietly):
Uh, yeah.

11:49.568 --> 11:52.035
I love Flip and Nan.
I hate Fred.

11:52.037 --> 11:53.269
No!
I know!

11:57.574 --> 11:58.739
So Fred's not shy,
he just sucks.

11:58.741 --> 12:00.240
When I asked him

12:00.242 --> 12:02.675
what his favorite hobby was,
he said, "Towels."

12:02.677 --> 12:05.744
I got to break up with that
human pile of saltine dust.

12:05.746 --> 12:07.378
I love Flip!
I mean, Flip taught me

12:07.380 --> 12:08.746
how to be vulnerable
with KC, you know?

12:08.748 --> 12:10.013
Yeah.
Nancy ear-candled me.

12:10.015 --> 12:12.181
I can hear for miles.

12:12.183 --> 12:13.749
Their relationship's
just such an inspiration,

12:13.751 --> 12:16.051
and I want to be around it,
but what can we do?

12:16.053 --> 12:17.585
We ditch Fred.
Forget about that dude.

12:17.587 --> 12:19.219
We establish
our own relationships

12:19.221 --> 12:20.787
with Flip and Nancy.

12:20.789 --> 12:23.222
Boom. Make future plans
with just them.

12:23.224 --> 12:24.790
"Future plans" is redundant,

12:24.792 --> 12:26.758
but other than that, I am on board!
Okay.

12:26.760 --> 12:29.193
Now, I'm gonna need some
alone time with Flip and Nancy.

12:29.195 --> 12:30.427
Can you stall Fred?

12:30.429 --> 12:31.594
Can I stall Fred?

12:31.596 --> 12:33.362
Of course I can stall Fred.

12:33.364 --> 12:35.597
I would do anything.
I love Flip and Nancy.

12:35.599 --> 12:37.599
Me, too! Are we totally crazy?

12:37.601 --> 12:39.067
Maybe! I don't even care!

12:39.069 --> 12:41.469
I don't even care, either.
Hmm.

12:41.471 --> 12:42.937
That's a vodka soda, I think.
(customers clamoring)

12:42.939 --> 12:44.571
Uh, it's close enough.

12:44.573 --> 12:46.739
I hear you! I'm getting to you!
Stop yelling at me!

12:46.741 --> 12:48.640
Shut up! I don't understand
what Cece's doing here.

12:48.642 --> 12:50.608
She led the walk-out.
If she's gonna be here,

12:50.610 --> 12:51.609
can she at least help us?!

12:51.611 --> 12:53.377
I am not gonna scab.

12:53.379 --> 12:54.778
Sorry, bae, I cannot scab,

12:54.780 --> 12:56.713
but I'm here for you
as your fiancée.

12:56.715 --> 12:58.748
You are my rock right now.
Do you need anything?

12:58.750 --> 13:00.382
No, I'm good, babe.
Okay, just let me know

13:00.384 --> 13:01.883
if you do. We are screwed!
MAN: Hey!

13:01.885 --> 13:04.452
Shut up! I'm trying my hardest!

13:04.454 --> 13:05.786
I shouldn't have fired Javier.

13:05.788 --> 13:07.654
I got to apologize.
This is all my fault.

13:07.656 --> 13:09.722
Obviously, this is your fault--
everybody knows that--

13:09.724 --> 13:10.823
but a boss never apologizes.

13:10.825 --> 13:12.057
It shows weakness.

13:12.059 --> 13:13.725
I feel like if Javier came back,

13:13.727 --> 13:15.426
the rest of the staff
would come back.

13:15.428 --> 13:17.294
That's a great idea.
I just said that.

13:17.296 --> 13:18.662
Such a great idea.

13:18.664 --> 13:21.798
Well, then give me one,
because I said it first.

13:21.800 --> 13:23.800
If you're giving it
for that idea,

13:23.802 --> 13:25.968
if it's about that idea,
then I deserve one.

13:25.970 --> 13:27.803
But I don't want one.

13:27.805 --> 13:28.637
And I felt left out.

13:28.639 --> 13:29.638
(clamoring continues)

13:29.640 --> 13:31.606
Shut up!

13:31.608 --> 13:33.674
Well, I wonder
what's taking them.

13:33.676 --> 13:36.243
Probably just the traff.
You know, the old 'ic.

13:36.245 --> 13:37.644
(both laugh)

13:37.646 --> 13:39.312
"The old 'ic."

13:39.314 --> 13:40.780
Anyway, I was thinking,
um, is there anything

13:40.782 --> 13:42.681
you guys like to do that
Fred doesn't like to do?

13:42.683 --> 13:44.816
'Cause I-I kind of...
I kind of just want

13:44.818 --> 13:46.818
to hang out with you
guys and not Fred.

13:47.821 --> 13:49.854
Hmm.

13:49.856 --> 13:52.323
Thank you for doing this,
by the way. This is great.

13:52.325 --> 13:53.490
Slow night.

13:53.492 --> 13:54.924
Just been
driving around,

13:54.926 --> 13:56.792
mouthing along
to hip-hop songs.

13:56.794 --> 13:59.127
Miss Officer, can we go?
I'm very hungry,

13:59.129 --> 14:00.828
and my possible
girlfriend and parents

14:00.830 --> 14:02.796
are waiting for us to order,
and it feels like

14:02.798 --> 14:04.130
you've done
over a million tests.

14:04.132 --> 14:05.998
That's what
I been saying!

14:06.000 --> 14:07.499
Where is the justice?

14:07.501 --> 14:09.434
You can go when
I tell you to go.

14:09.436 --> 14:11.636
Now, for your
next test...

14:11.638 --> 14:13.871
I want you to pretend
you're about to break-dance,

14:13.873 --> 14:16.273
but do not actually
break-dance.

14:16.275 --> 14:18.441
Break-dance-- that's it.
(Fred grumbling)

14:18.443 --> 14:19.442
I didn't mean...

14:19.444 --> 14:20.943
Buddy, I'm talk...

14:20.945 --> 14:22.511
Why would he take that
upon him...

14:22.513 --> 14:23.478
Don't ask.

14:23.480 --> 14:25.079
ALY:
I mean, whatever.

14:28.717 --> 14:30.216
Man, he's dumb!

14:30.218 --> 14:32.284
Give us more hands.

14:34.121 --> 14:35.720
Do it more animated.

14:35.722 --> 14:38.723
But less alive.

14:38.725 --> 14:40.057
That's pretty good.

14:40.059 --> 14:41.491
ALY:
Keep all of that,

14:41.493 --> 14:43.960
but pretend
you're underwater.

14:43.962 --> 14:45.695
Deeper.

14:46.864 --> 14:48.730
Deeper.

14:48.732 --> 14:50.498
Okay, Jess, uh,
what's going on here?

14:50.500 --> 14:51.499
Spill it.

14:51.501 --> 14:53.901
Well... (groans)

14:53.903 --> 14:56.370
it's just, you guys
are so amazing.

14:56.372 --> 14:57.971
And it's really rough out there,

14:57.973 --> 14:59.906
and it's nice to be
around something so great.

14:59.908 --> 15:03.175
And I-I'm not really
a love match with your son,

15:03.177 --> 15:08.512
but I think I might be in love
with you guys.

15:08.514 --> 15:09.913
(chuckles)

15:09.915 --> 15:12.382
Jess, we-we are glad
that you think that

15:12.384 --> 15:14.550
we're amazing.
Yes, we are.

15:14.552 --> 15:15.918
And we think that
you're amazing.

15:15.920 --> 15:18.320
Yes, we do.

15:18.322 --> 15:23.324
And, um... we know that
Fred isn't the best.

15:23.326 --> 15:24.758
We live with him.

15:24.760 --> 15:27.594
You know,
he can be so boring.

15:27.596 --> 15:30.597
I-It's like the apple
fell so far from the tree,

15:30.599 --> 15:32.098
it fell in a truck
Oh.

15:32.100 --> 15:33.866
and then disappeared
across state lines.

15:33.868 --> 15:36.368
(chuckles)
You guys are very honest.

15:36.370 --> 15:39.838
Did Fred ever tell you
that he loves model trains?

15:39.840 --> 15:42.607
Oh, those model trains.

15:42.609 --> 15:43.741
But he's your son.

15:43.743 --> 15:46.076
And we love him.
Deeply.

15:46.078 --> 15:50.713
And that's why we want
to make a deal with you.

15:50.715 --> 15:54.183
NANCY: You and Fred
equals you and us.

16:00.023 --> 16:01.555
Wow. L-Lovely home.

16:01.557 --> 16:02.756
Look, Javier,

16:02.758 --> 16:05.759
we've-we've come to give you
an incredible opportunity:

16:05.761 --> 16:08.862
for you to apologize
and get your job back.

16:08.864 --> 16:10.830
So, what do you say?

16:11.866 --> 16:13.098
(chuckles):
Okay, uh, well, Javier,

16:13.100 --> 16:15.100
let me tell you something.
Uh, I've been

16:15.102 --> 16:17.202
in the business world for
just shy of half of two decades,

16:17.204 --> 16:18.870
and I can tell you that
an opportunity like this

16:18.872 --> 16:21.606
does not come along
often, so...

16:22.542 --> 16:23.807
Your boss is extending his hand.

16:23.809 --> 16:25.141
Schmidt, stop.

16:25.143 --> 16:27.209
Look, Javier, I'm sorry.
I messed up.

16:27.211 --> 16:28.210
Nick, don't apologize.

16:28.212 --> 16:29.611
NICK: I've never
been a boss before,

16:29.613 --> 16:31.312
and it's weird, man.

16:31.314 --> 16:33.314
You're my friend, Javier.

16:33.316 --> 16:35.149
Remember when your
cousin was in town

16:35.151 --> 16:37.151
and-and my cousin was in town
and we kissed

16:37.153 --> 16:40.821
each other's cousins and...
then we peed on the ice maker?

16:40.823 --> 16:42.756
Yes. I remember that fondly.

16:42.758 --> 16:43.923
So rough.

16:43.925 --> 16:46.625
Look, we both chose
the bar over other stuff.

16:46.627 --> 16:50.061
I-I could've been a lawyer,
and-and you were a dentist.

16:50.063 --> 16:51.429
Were you really?
You were gonna be a dentist?

16:51.431 --> 16:52.897
Endodontist.

16:52.899 --> 16:54.431
Look, it's my job
to keep the bar open,

16:54.433 --> 16:57.901
but I still want it to be
a great place to work.

16:57.903 --> 17:00.270
If you come back,
that'll be my top priority.

17:00.272 --> 17:01.638
That and getting

17:01.640 --> 17:03.006
your old skanky cousin
back in town,

17:03.008 --> 17:05.008
so I could make out with her.

17:05.010 --> 17:08.011
And my skanky cousin
back in town,

17:08.013 --> 17:09.946
so you could make out with her.

17:09.948 --> 17:11.814
So what do you say?

17:11.816 --> 17:13.215
I say...

17:14.985 --> 17:16.284
...your mother.

17:16.286 --> 17:17.285
(chuckles)

17:17.287 --> 17:19.353
Your mother.
Your mother.

17:19.355 --> 17:20.587
Your mother!
Your mother!

17:20.589 --> 17:22.355
No, your mother!
(laughing)

17:22.357 --> 17:23.989
Ah, you son of a bitch.
I love you, man. Oh.

17:23.991 --> 17:25.590
You're the best, Nick.

17:25.592 --> 17:27.091
Yeah, you guys! Let's do it!
My hand...

17:27.093 --> 17:29.993
Next hand in, right? N...

17:29.995 --> 17:31.627
Okay, so you're saying
that if I date Fred

17:31.629 --> 17:34.096
that we can all
keep hanging out together.

17:34.098 --> 17:39.033
Yes. We don't want you to
lose us or for us to lose you.

17:39.035 --> 17:42.703
You're the child that
we always wanted to have.

17:42.705 --> 17:45.639
Imagine us as
grandparents.

17:45.641 --> 17:46.840
You think I haven't already?

17:46.842 --> 17:48.374
You'll learn to love Fred.

17:48.376 --> 17:49.875
And even better,

17:49.877 --> 17:51.877
you'll never have to go
on a first date again.

17:51.879 --> 17:53.879
Yeah. That sounds really good.

17:53.881 --> 17:56.047
There's no rush.
I mean, why don't

17:56.049 --> 17:59.016
we go up to the Vermont
house in the next few weeks

17:59.018 --> 18:00.884
and all be together?

18:00.886 --> 18:02.285
Vermont house?
Oh, yeah.

18:02.287 --> 18:03.686
It's an 18th century
farmhouse

18:03.688 --> 18:05.054
that we kind of
refurbished.

18:05.056 --> 18:06.822
Gah. Oh.

18:06.824 --> 18:09.891
We send romantic notes
on the clothesline.

18:09.893 --> 18:11.058
Oh, my geez.

18:11.060 --> 18:14.027
And a loom in the barn.

18:14.029 --> 18:15.628
(chuckles)
Poof.

18:15.630 --> 18:17.663
Hey, there!
Hi!

18:17.665 --> 18:19.231
(chuckling)

18:19.233 --> 18:20.732
WINSTON:
Right over here, buddy.

18:20.734 --> 18:22.633
I am terribly
sorry, you guys.

18:22.635 --> 18:24.635
We got held up
by an overzealous cop.

18:24.637 --> 18:26.637
Well, now, Fred, uh,
Jess was just saying

18:26.639 --> 18:28.338
how much she likes
model trains, right, Jess?

18:28.340 --> 18:31.040
FRED:
I didn't know you were

18:31.042 --> 18:32.074
a railie.

18:32.076 --> 18:33.708
That's so great.

18:33.710 --> 18:36.043
What's your gauge?
Are you a G gauge?

18:36.045 --> 18:39.212
Uh, G scale, gauge one?
HO scale? TT scale?

18:39.214 --> 18:41.347
Probably not
a tabletop girl, right?

18:41.349 --> 18:44.249
Do you do it costumed?
Or do you just do it leisurely?

18:44.251 --> 18:45.917
I deal mostly
with the, uh,

18:45.919 --> 18:48.519
transitional era,
post-Industrial Revolution.

18:48.521 --> 18:50.754
(groans)
I collect a lot of open-air

18:50.756 --> 18:52.088
coal engines.

18:52.090 --> 18:54.857
I'm the president of my
module group, actually.

18:54.859 --> 18:56.925
We use horn hook couplers,
so I'm kind of

18:56.927 --> 18:59.160
one of the best at
scenery building.

18:59.162 --> 19:02.663
Uh, just finished
this beautiful sanitation depot,

19:02.665 --> 19:04.097
made completely
out of balsa.

19:04.099 --> 19:06.866
I also was the first
to implement

19:06.868 --> 19:10.102
wire-framed humans, so that
the people are poseable.

19:10.104 --> 19:11.770
Station agent

19:11.772 --> 19:13.772
is now...
now he can bend his arm

19:13.774 --> 19:16.541
to say hello
as the train passes.

19:16.543 --> 19:19.043
There's one little girl
I use-- I call her Sally.

19:19.045 --> 19:21.678
I'm also quite good
at flocking snow,

19:21.680 --> 19:24.380
so I'm very popular
around the holidays.

19:24.382 --> 19:27.750
Ah! Stop! Please stop. I just,
uh... I ca... I can't do this.

19:27.752 --> 19:29.752
I can't believe I was even
considering doing this.

19:29.754 --> 19:31.553
I can't just settle
down to settle down.

19:31.555 --> 19:34.122
I really, really want you to
consider what you're giving up.

19:34.124 --> 19:38.092
Yeah, Terry Gross owns the
house next to us in Vermont.

19:38.094 --> 19:40.060
Oh, my God. Do you run into her
at syrup festivals?

19:40.062 --> 19:41.728
FRED:
We had a horse.

19:41.730 --> 19:43.129
Until it ran away.

19:43.131 --> 19:44.530
Its name was Daniel.

19:44.532 --> 19:46.198
Daniel Boulevard.

19:46.200 --> 19:48.133
I got to pick the last name,

19:48.135 --> 19:49.934
and I named him while
we were in the car.

19:49.936 --> 19:50.935
I have to go!

19:50.937 --> 19:52.069
Let's go.
Hey, listen,

19:52.071 --> 19:53.570
Jess and I really aren't
that close.

19:53.572 --> 19:56.205
I'm all about horses.
JESS: We're going!

19:56.207 --> 19:58.106
SCHMIDT:<i> You know what, Nick,</i>
<i> you were right.</i>

19:58.108 --> 19:59.907
A bar isn't just a place
of business.

19:59.909 --> 20:02.042
It's a place for people.
Mm.

20:02.044 --> 20:04.044
Which is something
I truly hate about it.

20:04.046 --> 20:05.545
Bunch of
bottom-feeders here.

20:05.547 --> 20:07.980
Chum at the bottom
of the ocean. Yuck.

20:07.982 --> 20:09.982
I know. And that's why,
as a manager,

20:09.984 --> 20:11.950
I'm thinking I have to fire you.

20:11.952 --> 20:14.986
Maybe you should fire me.
What do you think?

20:14.988 --> 20:17.121
You save enough money,
buy me out one day,

20:17.123 --> 20:19.790
you run this place
on your own.

20:19.792 --> 20:20.957
You really think I could?

20:20.959 --> 20:22.591
Yeah, definitely.

20:22.593 --> 20:24.392
I mean, your dumb bitch
of a mother sure could.

20:24.394 --> 20:25.960
What?

20:25.962 --> 20:28.128
Your-your mother, who, uh,

20:28.130 --> 20:30.630
we're referring to in this
circumstance as a dumb bitch.

20:30.632 --> 20:32.498
I think she could probably...
Wait, what?

20:32.500 --> 20:34.066
Come on. That's what you
and Javier do, right?

20:34.068 --> 20:35.434
C... Your... Uh, your mother,

20:35.436 --> 20:37.235
who, uh, you know,
is a dumb... is a dumb...

20:37.237 --> 20:39.003
Is that not...
is that not how the joke goes?

20:39.005 --> 20:40.070
(chuckles):
I know.

20:40.072 --> 20:41.237
Thanks, man.
Thank you.

20:41.239 --> 20:42.638
Um, can I have another napkin?

20:42.640 --> 20:45.073
Are you sure?
Uh, yeah, I don't need one.

20:47.010 --> 20:48.242
You know, look,
I know they turned out

20:48.244 --> 20:49.243
super weird and kind of like

20:49.245 --> 20:50.744
rich pimps, but...

20:50.746 --> 20:52.145
I just kind of miss 'em,
you know?

20:52.147 --> 20:55.148
I'm glad they were weird.
Kind of snapped me out of it.

20:55.150 --> 20:56.249
I was about
one park day away

20:56.251 --> 20:59.252
from a Vermont
model train-themed wedding.

20:59.254 --> 21:01.254
Yo, Nick,
you like my shirt?

21:01.256 --> 21:02.822
It look like I'm naked.

21:02.824 --> 21:03.989
Very cool, man.
(laughs)

21:03.991 --> 21:05.824
Right.
Come here, man.

21:05.826 --> 21:07.325
Hey, get out of here.
I'll catch up later.

21:07.327 --> 21:09.093
Boss man's got to go over the books.
Okay.

21:09.095 --> 21:11.428
Good to have you back, man.

21:14.766 --> 21:17.366
Oh, this is very terrible.

21:17.368 --> 21:19.000
♪ ♪

21:19.002 --> 21:20.267
I don't believe you.

21:23.171 --> 21:24.436
Can you put, like,

21:24.438 --> 21:25.537
a jazz spin on that?

21:29.008 --> 21:30.340
Look like an acorn.

21:30.342 --> 21:32.141
Start spinning.

21:32.143 --> 21:33.609
That's actually
pretty good.

21:33.611 --> 21:35.844
WINSTON: I just feel really
bad for Flip and Nancy.

21:35.846 --> 21:38.880
ALY:
<i> Shut up about Flip and Nancy.</i>
