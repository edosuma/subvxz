00:21.789 --> 00:26.227
(ominous electronic

(ominous electronic

00:45.479 --> 00:49.417
(ominous electronic music fades)

00:49.550 --> 00:50.684
- He's doin' it again, Mom.

00:50.818 --> 00:53.754
- (scoffs) Jonah, Jonah!

00:54.988 --> 00:56.424
Put it away, sweetheart.

00:56.557 --> 00:58.359
- Nobody can see it.
- That's not the point.

00:58.492 --> 00:59.660
Just put it in the
clip where it belongs,

00:59.793 --> 01:00.828
and stop fidgeting.

01:01.729 --> 01:02.696
We're almost there.

01:04.165 --> 01:07.435
And you, phone!

01:07.568 --> 01:08.902
God, please tell me
you don't act like this

01:09.036 --> 01:10.338
when I'm not around.

01:10.471 --> 01:12.740
- Oh, don't worry, I keep
these backseat bitches in line.

01:12.873 --> 01:15.109
- You know all about being
a backseat bitch, don't you?

01:15.243 --> 01:16.710
- (scoffs) Fuck you.

01:16.844 --> 01:19.147
- Language, Becca,
guys, knock it off!

01:21.315 --> 01:23.984
It was a mistake
bringing all of you.

01:24.118 --> 01:26.554
I wish I just brought
Eddie or Duke instead.

01:26.687 --> 01:29.123
- Oh, no, we'll lock
it up, Mom, okay?

01:29.257 --> 01:30.658
Sorry.

01:30.791 --> 01:32.726
- [Isa] He's still
listenin' to something.

01:32.860 --> 01:34.328
- That's how he preps.

01:34.462 --> 01:37.030
Let him listen to it,
it's not bothering you.

01:38.166 --> 01:39.733
- What did I just say?

01:41.235 --> 01:43.404
Take them out, Cain.

01:43.537 --> 01:45.906
(Cain sighing)

01:46.574 --> 01:48.276
- So how many we expectin'?

01:48.409 --> 01:49.977
- [Isa] You really don't
listen to me, do you?

01:50.110 --> 01:51.312
- I just did, didn't I?

01:51.445 --> 01:54.582
- 10, maybe more, that's
why I want us all there.

01:55.383 --> 01:57.385
- You should've brought
the M60 for this, Mom.

01:57.518 --> 01:59.220
Mow all the motherfuckers down.

01:59.353 --> 02:00.854
- Yeah, is that right?

02:00.988 --> 02:02.856
You gonna carry that
all by yourself?

02:04.458 --> 02:06.527
- If I couldn't, who
could, right, Cain?

02:06.660 --> 02:08.796
- Get your fucking
hands off me, dickhole.

02:08.929 --> 02:10.964
- That's it, get out!

02:11.899 --> 02:13.667
You're driving me crazy
today, you know that, right?

02:13.801 --> 02:14.535
- [Becca] What about the job?

02:14.668 --> 02:15.603
They already paid half up front.

02:15.736 --> 02:16.604
- What the hell do I care?

02:16.737 --> 02:17.905
I'll give the money back.

02:19.006 --> 02:20.508
Because what I'm
looking at right now,

02:20.641 --> 02:22.476
are my three kids who'd
rather act like idiots,

02:22.610 --> 02:23.811
instead of trained
professionals.

02:23.944 --> 02:26.113
- One of them isn't acting.

02:26.247 --> 02:28.316
- I'm sorry, okay?

02:28.449 --> 02:30.684
- Yeah, I'm sorry.

02:30.818 --> 02:32.152
- I'm not.

02:32.286 --> 02:33.621
I'm just wonderin', are these
guys gonna be armed, yeah?

02:33.754 --> 02:35.323
I mean, they're probably gonna
have a stash of some sort?

02:35.456 --> 02:37.725
- We went over this
at the house, yes.

02:37.858 --> 02:39.059
- All right, then.

02:39.193 --> 02:40.761
Won't you give Jonah the
M4, Becca can have the MP5,

02:40.894 --> 02:41.962
Ma, you rock what you rock,

02:42.095 --> 02:44.031
and we just sweep the
motherfuckers dry.

02:44.164 --> 02:46.800
How's that for being
focused, ladies?

02:47.935 --> 02:50.671
- Let's light 'em up.
I can fuck with that.

02:55.443 --> 02:58.646
(vehicle approaching)

03:02.650 --> 03:04.652
(vehicle stopping)

03:04.785 --> 03:06.220
- Okay, we're here.

03:06.920 --> 03:08.522
Roddy's gonna pick up
the car and torch it,

03:08.656 --> 03:11.024
and Zane's gonna meet us
down on 6th, questions?

03:11.158 --> 03:12.693
- How do we know which
car he's gonna be in?

03:12.826 --> 03:15.062
- (chuckles) You'll
know it's Zane.

03:15.195 --> 03:17.231
Okay, pop the trunk and suit up.

03:17.365 --> 03:19.233
I'm gonna do a
last minute casing.

03:19.367 --> 03:22.603
And kids, shit
acting is not family.

03:24.872 --> 03:28.509
(tense instrumental music)

03:33.681 --> 03:38.151
(tense instrumental
music continues)

03:40.087 --> 03:41.555
(tense instrumental
music continues)

03:41.689 --> 03:42.923
- Are we doing
this or what, lady?

03:43.056 --> 03:44.858
- She never
disappoints, does she?

03:44.992 --> 03:46.860
- [Jonah] Fuck that
M60, you feel me?

03:48.529 --> 03:50.197
- She knows how to pack
it in, I'll give her that.

03:50.331 --> 03:52.300
- What was all that
directing bullshit

03:52.433 --> 03:53.601
you were saying to Mom?

03:53.734 --> 03:55.569
Trying to win some brownie
points or something?

03:55.703 --> 03:57.004
- Just trying to
help you two out,

03:57.137 --> 03:58.439
guide you two along.

03:58.572 --> 04:01.074
- You knew what I like,
I ain't complainin'.

04:01.208 --> 04:04.278
- You might what
trigger-happy boy wants to do.

04:04.412 --> 04:06.780
Grab your little
piece, and let's go.

04:07.948 --> 04:09.483
- Ho ass bitch.

04:13.554 --> 04:16.957
(tense instrumental
music continues)

04:17.090 --> 04:20.227

05:01.569 --> 05:06.006
(intense electronic

05:08.509 --> 05:11.278
- Come on, we late,
we late, let's go,

05:11.412 --> 05:13.213
let's go, ladies.

05:13.347 --> 05:16.650
Hurry that shit up, we
got a drop tommorow.

05:21.555 --> 05:25.993
(intense electronic

05:42.009 --> 05:43.276
Bro, we got four.

05:43.411 --> 05:45.345
Let's go, let's go, let's
go, come on now, we gotta go!

05:45.479 --> 05:46.680
Bro, what you doin', man?

05:46.814 --> 05:48.248
We gotta go.

05:48.382 --> 05:52.185
Let's go, let's go.

(Caine farting)

06:38.398 --> 06:41.101
(guns rustling)

06:44.237 --> 06:45.205
- Let's go.

06:47.508 --> 06:52.212
(intense electronic music)
(guns firing)

06:52.813 --> 06:55.549
(people yelling)

06:56.650 --> 06:58.719
- [Thug] Shoot
that motherfucker!

06:58.852 --> 07:03.123
(guns continue firing)
(man yelling)

07:03.256 --> 07:06.393
(intense electronic
music continues)

07:06.527 --> 07:07.961
- Come on, bitch.

07:09.697 --> 07:11.131
- [Thug] Come on!

07:14.034 --> 07:18.472
(intense electronic
music continues)

07:23.176 --> 07:25.679
(man yelling)

07:30.918 --> 07:35.322
(intense electronic
music continues)

07:38.258 --> 07:39.126
- Come on.
- Shit.

07:39.259 --> 07:40.260
- [Thug] Let's get out of here.

07:40.393 --> 07:41.729
How much time we got?

07:41.862 --> 07:45.533
(people faintly yelling)

07:49.537 --> 07:52.139
(vent humming)

07:58.579 --> 08:01.849
(vent continues humming)

08:01.982 --> 08:05.018
(footsteps tapping)

08:05.919 --> 08:07.054
- My kids are gonna kill you.

08:07.187 --> 08:09.422
- Shut up!
- Shut the fuck up.

08:09.557 --> 08:11.191
- Shut up, bitch.
- Drop your weapon.

08:11.324 --> 08:12.993
- Drop the fucking gun, now.

08:13.126 --> 08:14.361
- Drop the fucking guns!

08:14.494 --> 08:17.297
- Drop your weapons, I'll
drop you right fucking now!

08:17.430 --> 08:18.498
- Mom!
- Drop your weapons.

08:18.632 --> 08:22.870
(everyone chattering)
- Shoot him!

08:23.003 --> 08:24.371
Just shoot him!

08:24.672 --> 08:27.775
- You, got three
seconds, three, two...

08:28.976 --> 08:32.045
- My kids are gonna kill you.
- Shut up, bitch!

08:32.179 --> 08:33.881
- Nobody calls Ma
a bitch but me.

08:35.716 --> 08:38.118
- Cain, oh, Cain,

08:38.251 --> 08:40.353
I don't know what happened.
- You okay?

08:40.487 --> 08:41.188
- Let's get her to the car.

08:41.321 --> 08:42.389
- Let's go.

08:42.522 --> 08:43.824
- Grab it, grab it, grab it.
- I got it.

08:43.957 --> 08:45.092
- [Jonah] Grab your gun.

08:46.927 --> 08:49.129
Come on, let's go, let's go.
- Hurry.

08:49.262 --> 08:50.397
- What the hell happened?
- Let's go.

08:50.530 --> 08:51.498
- I don't know.

08:51.632 --> 08:52.666
- Where is he?

08:55.703 --> 08:59.039
Get the door, get the door!
- Get the pass.

09:03.611 --> 09:04.511
- [Zane] What the fuck happened?

09:04.645 --> 09:06.580
- [Cane] We don't know.

09:06.714 --> 09:10.350
(intense electronic music)

09:12.986 --> 09:15.222
- What the fuck happened?
- We don't know!

09:15.355 --> 09:17.057
- She just collapsed,
nobody got hit.

09:17.190 --> 09:17.691
It was going fine in there-

09:17.825 --> 09:19.126
- It's not fine!

09:19.259 --> 09:20.661
If this genius just showed
up when he was supposed to.

09:20.794 --> 09:22.362
- [Cain] Again, bitch.

09:22.495 --> 09:23.897
- Shut up, the both of you!

09:24.031 --> 09:25.699
- We gotta take
her to a hospital!

09:25.833 --> 09:27.567
This has never happened to her.

09:27.701 --> 09:30.437
- What, are you out
of your fuckin' mind?

09:30.570 --> 09:32.205
- Have you noticed anything
over the past few days?

09:32.339 --> 09:34.541
You're the one spending all
the fucking time with her.

09:34.675 --> 09:36.109
- What the fuck does that mean?

09:36.243 --> 09:37.811
- I think you know exactly
what it means, cougar hunter.

09:37.945 --> 09:40.748
- Fucking little shit!
- Get off me.

09:40.881 --> 09:41.749
- Watch the road!

09:41.882 --> 09:43.350
- All three of you little shits,

09:43.483 --> 09:44.117
you treat your mom
like she's some kinda

09:44.251 --> 09:46.053
personal cash vendor.

09:46.186 --> 09:47.287
- We earn our fuckin' keep.

09:47.420 --> 09:48.722
Why the fuck are you
still hangin' around?

09:48.856 --> 09:50.457
Oh, it better be fucking loaded.

09:52.726 --> 09:54.227
Don't fucking try me,
Zane, I don't need a reason

09:54.361 --> 09:55.495
to pull this fuckin' trigger.

09:58.331 --> 09:59.266
- I'm gonna remember this.

09:59.399 --> 10:01.134
- I hope you do.

10:01.268 --> 10:02.670
- Please stop fighting.

10:05.038 --> 10:06.473
- [Zane] What do
you want me to do?

10:08.141 --> 10:13.480
- Zane. Jesus, take us home.

10:16.583 --> 10:17.685
- You got it.

10:19.252 --> 10:21.722
(Isa crying)

10:26.259 --> 10:29.229
(object shuffling)

10:30.864 --> 10:33.533
(Becca sighing)

10:38.471 --> 10:40.774
(no audio)

10:43.977 --> 10:49.016
(clothes rustling)
(Becca slurping)

10:51.919 --> 10:54.621
(Caine sighing)

10:58.491 --> 11:00.193
- Get any sleep?

11:00.327 --> 11:03.831
(Becca sighing)

11:03.964 --> 11:05.733
I guess that makes two of us.

11:07.634 --> 11:10.137
- Did you come in
to see her at all?

11:10.270 --> 11:12.172
You that much of
a selfish prick?

11:17.978 --> 11:19.212
- Not that you'd believe me,

11:19.346 --> 11:22.883
but I don't like
seeing Mom like that.

11:25.719 --> 11:26.754
I don't think I've ever

11:26.887 --> 11:30.523
seen her like that,
it fucked with me.

11:32.993 --> 11:34.327
- Yeah, I haven't either.

11:35.228 --> 11:37.731
- When was the last time
she even had a cold?

11:37.865 --> 11:39.332
Nothing could knock
her out like that.

11:39.466 --> 11:42.002
That's what I don't get.

11:42.135 --> 11:46.239
- Yeah. I was thinking
the same thing.

11:46.373 --> 11:47.741
It doesn't make any sense.

11:53.313 --> 11:54.848
- It's just not her.

11:56.649 --> 11:58.385
She's done sweeps 10
times more intense

11:58.518 --> 11:59.586
than that and still made it home

11:59.719 --> 12:01.889
in time to cook our
ungrateful asses dinner.

12:04.324 --> 12:05.392
You remember that?

12:10.163 --> 12:12.599
- Jonah's practically been
by her side all night.

12:13.433 --> 12:15.235
He's always been a mama's boy.

12:15.368 --> 12:19.206
- Yeah, he's a good
kid, means well.

12:19.339 --> 12:21.074
Not like assholes like us.

12:26.579 --> 12:27.881
What about lover boy?

12:28.015 --> 12:29.582
- Oh, don't call him that.

12:29.716 --> 12:31.751
- He's such a rat fuck.

12:31.885 --> 12:34.687
- He only comes around when
it's sexually expedient.

12:34.822 --> 12:36.423
- Or financially.

12:36.556 --> 12:38.425
- What?

12:38.558 --> 12:39.893
- Nothing.

12:42.529 --> 12:43.430
- Thought you really wanted

12:43.563 --> 12:45.065
to do him in when
he was driving.

12:46.099 --> 12:50.203
- I did, you have no idea.

12:53.974 --> 12:56.910
- She's awake, and wants
to talk to all of us.

12:57.044 --> 12:58.245
- Let's go, that's good news.

12:58.378 --> 13:01.448
- No. She said all of us.

13:03.516 --> 13:05.485
- [Becca] I'll
call Zane as well.

13:05.618 --> 13:07.821
- Just tell him to
hurry his ass up.

13:07.955 --> 13:11.758
(ominous instrumental music)

13:14.727 --> 13:17.430
(ominous instrumental
music continues)

13:17.564 --> 13:19.299
- I can't explain this.

13:19.432 --> 13:21.568
It's not a heart
attack, not a stroke.

13:22.669 --> 13:23.703
I think we just gotta wait for

13:23.837 --> 13:25.038
the blood results to come back.

13:26.406 --> 13:28.341
In the meantime, get some rest.

13:28.475 --> 13:30.510
And then hit me up
if you need anything.

13:31.678 --> 13:34.614
- You're a rockstar, Kenny,
you always have been.

13:39.286 --> 13:42.089
- I've never seen anything
drop you like this before,

13:42.222 --> 13:43.924
and I'm gonna work my
ass off to figure out

13:44.057 --> 13:45.158
what it is.

13:45.292 --> 13:46.526
- Kenny, really, I could
get out of bed right now.

13:46.659 --> 13:48.028
I feel so much better.

13:48.161 --> 13:52.465
- Stop. I'm going to figure it
out so you can kick its ass,

13:52.599 --> 13:54.334
and then get back up, all right?

13:54.467 --> 13:56.369
- Yeah.
- Take of yourself, all right?

13:56.503 --> 13:57.837
- Thanks.

13:57.971 --> 13:59.439
- Thanks.
- All right.

14:04.644 --> 14:08.181
- I can't believe he
didn't find anything.

14:09.983 --> 14:12.152
- Regardless of what
Kenny finds out is wrong,

14:13.153 --> 14:16.456
I wanted you all here
because you're what's

14:16.589 --> 14:18.191
most important to me.

14:19.826 --> 14:22.195
I really thought I could
go on a few more years,

14:23.330 --> 14:25.265
but what happened, has
me rethinking everything.

14:25.398 --> 14:26.666
- Mom, it wasn't
even that serious-

14:26.799 --> 14:29.036
- Just let me finish.
- Shut up.

14:30.370 --> 14:34.741
- I think it was
a sign, I'm out.

14:34.874 --> 14:36.176
- What do you mean you're out?

14:36.309 --> 14:37.978
You're gonna kick this and
you're gonna bounce back.

14:38.111 --> 14:39.412
You can't make a decision
like that after one day.

14:39.546 --> 14:41.014
- It hasn't been just one day.

14:41.148 --> 14:42.082
I've been talking
to Zane about this.

14:42.215 --> 14:43.683
- You had something
to do with this?

14:43.816 --> 14:46.886
- Cain, stop it.

14:47.020 --> 14:50.190
- Yeah, listen to your
little bro, and chill out.

14:52.960 --> 14:54.727
- Don't take this out on Zane.

14:55.628 --> 14:56.796
This was my decision.

14:56.930 --> 14:58.131
He was just someone
I could talk to,

14:58.265 --> 14:59.632
and bounce ideas off of.

14:59.766 --> 15:00.833
'Cause God knows none of you

15:00.968 --> 15:02.435
have been around
here much lately.

15:02.569 --> 15:06.073
- Mom, we can't
do it without you.

15:06.206 --> 15:08.775
You organize
literally everything.

15:10.410 --> 15:12.579
- Yeah, well, you know,
I'm more than willing

15:12.712 --> 15:16.416
to take the load off
while she gets better.

15:16.549 --> 15:17.951
- No, the fuck you will.

15:18.751 --> 15:20.653
- What did you say?
- You seem to have

15:20.787 --> 15:23.690
a hearing problem, why don't
I correct your ass, don't ya?

15:23.823 --> 15:25.792
- Okay, both of you just stop.

15:25.925 --> 15:27.627
This is how it's gonna go.

15:28.928 --> 15:32.399
I'm not picking you,
Cain, or any of you.

15:32.532 --> 15:34.234
I'm freezing everything.

15:34.367 --> 15:35.768
Clients owed are gonna
get their money back,

15:35.902 --> 15:37.404
and they'll have
to go elsewhere.

15:37.537 --> 15:39.139
And no hits are gonna be put in.

15:40.107 --> 15:44.611
And that bible stays
right next to me.

15:44.744 --> 15:48.448
- Honey, we stop now
we lose everything.

15:48.581 --> 15:50.483
- Well, maybe we
should lose everything.

15:51.451 --> 15:54.654
I know you all have enough
10 times over to get by.

15:54.787 --> 15:57.557
For some of you, it's just
recreational at this point.

15:59.326 --> 16:01.494
And judging from what
happened yesterday,

16:02.895 --> 16:04.831
you all screwed up in my book.

16:04.964 --> 16:05.732
- What are you talking about?

16:05.865 --> 16:06.666
- Don't even pretend to act like

16:06.799 --> 16:08.201
you don't know what happened.

16:08.335 --> 16:10.270
You showing up late
almost got us all killed.

16:10.403 --> 16:11.138
- Ma, I-

16:11.271 --> 16:12.272
- Oh, don't Ma me!

16:14.441 --> 16:16.843
I built this business up myself.

16:16.976 --> 16:18.578
You think your father helped?

16:18.711 --> 16:20.313
The man was weak.

16:20.447 --> 16:21.648
You know the story.

16:21.781 --> 16:22.682
- You're right.

16:23.750 --> 16:25.118
Whatever you wanna
do, I'm okay with it.

16:25.252 --> 16:27.454
- Thank you.
- Me too, Mom.

16:27.587 --> 16:29.889
- Thanks. Cain?

16:35.262 --> 16:37.330
- And where the hell
did you go last night?

16:37.464 --> 16:38.465
- What?

16:38.598 --> 16:40.800
- Becca said you left?
- 'Cause you did.

16:40.933 --> 16:44.337
- I left to go outside with
my gun and stand guard.

16:44.471 --> 16:46.406
- You're a lying piece of shit.

16:53.146 --> 16:54.881
- I don't know who to believe.

16:56.516 --> 16:58.451
- Listen, listen, we
should talk about this,

16:58.585 --> 16:59.952
one-on-one, okay?

17:02.355 --> 17:05.458
Maybe you need to settle down,
so you can think clearly.

17:05.592 --> 17:07.394
- Okay, my mind is clear.

17:07.527 --> 17:09.996
This is how it's gonna
go, until I say different.

17:10.130 --> 17:11.564
- You hear that, lover boy?

17:11.698 --> 17:13.266
Looks like we won't be
seeing you around as often

17:13.400 --> 17:14.101
as you'd like.

17:14.234 --> 17:17.370
- Cain, could you stop?

17:17.504 --> 17:18.738
- Don't worry about it.

17:20.207 --> 17:23.210
Let your big bro
process his feelings.

17:26.313 --> 17:27.414
Maybe you're right.

17:27.547 --> 17:32.051
Maybe we all just need to
take a break, calm down,

17:32.185 --> 17:34.421
and we can figure everything
out when we're clear.

17:36.323 --> 17:39.926
- Zane, I just need
you and everyone else

17:40.059 --> 17:42.028
to just cool it for awhile.

17:42.162 --> 17:44.431
No picking up side jobs
related to this either.

17:44.564 --> 17:46.966
We just have to go radio
silent and off the map.

17:47.100 --> 17:49.736
But after that, I am
gonna pick who leads.

17:49.869 --> 17:54.874
I promise, if it makes
you feel any better,

17:56.676 --> 18:00.580
they're in this room,
we all know that.

18:01.114 --> 18:04.050
- They? Cause I'm a he.

18:07.354 --> 18:09.956
(both moaning)

18:17.029 --> 18:18.565
Feel better, baby.

18:21.534 --> 18:22.935
- Zane, Zane.
- Hm?

18:26.539 --> 18:30.677
- I'd love to, but I
can't, I've gotta get home.

18:34.247 --> 18:36.949
(door creaking)

18:39.352 --> 18:41.053
- Mom, what the fuck was that?

18:44.491 --> 18:46.259
- Stop pushing him away.

18:46.393 --> 18:48.695
You can't treat him like that.

18:48.828 --> 18:50.563
He's gone now, probably
because of you guys-

18:50.697 --> 18:51.664
- He's a piece of shit snake.

18:51.798 --> 18:52.799
- Okay, don't
start that with me.

18:52.932 --> 18:55.067
Our problem is because of you.

18:55.202 --> 18:56.936
So just stay out of my business.

19:00.840 --> 19:03.476
(Zane huffing)

19:06.112 --> 19:08.581
(hand pounding)

19:08.715 --> 19:12.118
(Zane huffing)

19:14.454 --> 19:16.989
(gun cocking)

19:21.428 --> 19:24.197
(feet pattering)

19:27.434 --> 19:29.836
- I think she'll be
quick with the next move.

19:29.969 --> 19:31.504
She doesn't sandbag anything.

19:33.506 --> 19:36.175
- Looks like I'm gonna be
seeing a lot more of you guys.

19:39.279 --> 19:41.147
It's always great
catching up, Jonah.

19:45.818 --> 19:49.722
Becca, good seeing you.
- Thanks.

19:52.592 --> 19:54.894
- Now the strong, silent type.

19:56.263 --> 19:57.997
Any parting words for me?

19:59.466 --> 20:01.568
'Cause I'm all ears.

20:06.539 --> 20:08.841
- Whatever you
were thinking, no.

20:11.378 --> 20:13.613
You were never
really good at it.

20:14.847 --> 20:17.417
Things didn't work out
between you and my mom, boo.

20:19.218 --> 20:20.387
You need to walk away.

20:20.520 --> 20:22.289
- [Becca] Cain, I
think he gets it.

20:23.690 --> 20:28.395
- No, it's okay, I like to
hear you speak your mind.

20:28.528 --> 20:30.363
Reminds me that
he still has one.

20:31.831 --> 20:33.466
Besides, maybe you're right.

20:33.600 --> 20:36.636
Maybe I didn't think this whole
thing all the way through.

20:38.905 --> 20:40.707
But that's the fun
sometimes, isn't it?

20:42.809 --> 20:47.580
- Know this, I don't
care what my mom says,

20:47.714 --> 20:49.749
I don't wanna see your
ass around here anymore.

20:51.518 --> 20:54.854
- You ain't just gonna see my
ass, you'll see my balls too.

20:55.588 --> 20:59.025
- Don't be surprised when I
shove it right back up your ass.

21:00.059 --> 21:02.261
- As long as you show
up on time, big boy.

21:02.395 --> 21:04.897
- Somebody's gotta be here
to take out the trash.

21:08.234 --> 21:09.736
- Take it easy, kid.

21:11.538 --> 21:12.905
You kiss your mom
with that mouth?

21:13.039 --> 21:15.542
- I guess you know
what it tastes like.

21:20.880 --> 21:22.315
- I don't like him either,

21:22.449 --> 21:24.351
but those stupid threats
aren't gonna phase him.

21:24.484 --> 21:26.218
He's gonna do whatever he wants.

21:26.353 --> 21:28.788
- Yeah, would you cool
it the fuck off, man.

21:28.921 --> 21:31.090
Both of you shit on
him way too much.

21:32.925 --> 21:34.661
He cares about her
like we all do.

21:35.428 --> 21:37.597
- You're really that
dumb, aren't you?

21:40.800 --> 21:41.901
You two have fun.

21:45.605 --> 21:47.507
- Don't listen to him.

21:47.640 --> 21:49.442
- We gotta watch those two.

21:49.576 --> 21:51.511
I'm telling you, for Mom's sake.

21:53.446 --> 21:54.481
- Cain respects Mom.

21:55.682 --> 21:58.250
And Zane, he's not gonna
try anything after all that.

21:59.318 --> 22:00.953
- I hope you're right.

22:06.192 --> 22:08.661
(feet pattering)

22:14.266 --> 22:16.636
(car beeping)

22:20.139 --> 22:24.477
- We have a problem.

22:24.611 --> 22:28.314
- With Isa?
- That bitch Cain?

22:30.950 --> 22:32.018
- With everyone.

22:38.057 --> 22:41.428
(calm electronic music)

22:47.500 --> 22:51.704
(calm electronic
music continues)

22:56.242 --> 23:00.480
(calm electronic
music continues)

23:04.851 --> 23:09.556
(calm electronic
music continues)

23:09.689 --> 23:11.223
(calm electronic
music continues)

23:11.357 --> 23:12.391
- [Mickey] Whoo-wee!

23:13.826 --> 23:17.430
Girl, you look like
that J. Johansson,

23:17.564 --> 23:19.866
from the "Justice
League," the Widow.

23:19.999 --> 23:22.201
Come here, spin me in your web.

23:22.334 --> 23:24.804
Yo, what is happening, man?

23:24.937 --> 23:26.238
How you doing?

23:26.372 --> 23:28.941
- It's been awhile,
Mickey, what's going on?

23:29.075 --> 23:31.511
- You know, killing
motherfuckers

23:31.644 --> 23:33.780
for a living every single day.

23:37.684 --> 23:40.920
Hey, look, he's back here,
but can I get you anything?

23:41.053 --> 23:42.388
You know we got everything.

23:43.623 --> 23:45.558
- Nah, I'm good for now, man.

23:47.059 --> 23:47.927
- All right.

23:49.929 --> 23:52.264
Oh, I see you're
taking it all in.

23:52.398 --> 23:58.237
Yeah. Zane's been redecorating.
Upgrading, if you will.

23:58.905 --> 24:00.406
Murder money, baby.

24:02.341 --> 24:05.311
- Hey, look who
decided to show up.

24:05.444 --> 24:07.614
Where you been,
you goofy bastard?

24:08.781 --> 24:12.084
- Been busy taking
care of my mom.

24:12.218 --> 24:13.686
You guys should know that.

24:14.987 --> 24:18.290
- Yeah, look man, we're
sorry to hear about that.

24:18.424 --> 24:21.260
Your mom, though,
she's a tough broad.

24:21.393 --> 24:25.097
- Real tough, like bullets
bouncing off her tough.

24:25.231 --> 24:26.966
- Pew-Pew.

24:27.099 --> 24:29.468
- Then why haven't you
stopped by to see her?

24:29.602 --> 24:32.471
She got Zane in on this
and then you guys followed.

24:32.605 --> 24:35.575
You owe her everything.

24:35.708 --> 24:36.776
- Owe her?

24:37.744 --> 24:39.445
Look here, little man.

24:40.079 --> 24:44.350
I'll fucking kill you,
know where you're at.

24:45.618 --> 24:47.620
You come around here
again acting crazy,

24:47.754 --> 24:49.121
I'll fucking kill you.

24:49.255 --> 24:55.494
- Oh, oh, ain't a job,
ain't a job, okay?

24:56.062 --> 25:01.200
Chill. Look, we're family, okay?

25:01.768 --> 25:03.536
You hurt, we hurt.

25:04.336 --> 25:06.372
We're here to have a good time.

25:06.505 --> 25:08.274
Let's have a good time.

25:14.213 --> 25:16.816
- Look, Mickey, any other time,

25:16.949 --> 25:18.585
you know I wouldn't
be like this.

25:18.718 --> 25:19.986
But Zane called me over to talk,

25:20.119 --> 25:21.353
and I just wanna talk to him.

25:22.254 --> 25:23.990
My mind's on other
shit right now.

25:25.024 --> 25:26.726
Show me where he's at.

25:27.560 --> 25:28.427
- All right, all
right, follow me.

25:35.301 --> 25:37.236
Yeah, man, don't
worry about Franklin.

25:38.170 --> 25:39.806
His big, Dwayne
Johnson looking ass

25:39.939 --> 25:42.675
just mad he ain't getting
no coochie tonight.

25:43.643 --> 25:45.845
- [Jonah] Looks like
he's doing just fine.

25:45.978 --> 25:48.380
- Yeah, right until I
come scoop the bitch up.

25:54.053 --> 25:56.522
- Jonah, Jonah, Jonah.

25:56.656 --> 25:57.990
There you are.

25:58.124 --> 26:00.392
You've been avoiding us.

26:00.526 --> 26:01.628
- What are you talking about?

26:01.761 --> 26:03.429
- Yeah, why haven't
you been doing jobs

26:03.562 --> 26:05.431
with us anymore, huh?

26:05.564 --> 26:07.333
You problem?

26:07.466 --> 26:10.069
- Everyone knows you're the
best straight shooter around.

26:12.171 --> 26:14.206
- Thanks, Jonah.

26:14.340 --> 26:16.408
Looks like you won't be
needing this anymore.

26:21.580 --> 26:23.415
- Give me the fucking gun.

26:23.549 --> 26:28.020
- Ooh, sexy.

26:32.959 --> 26:36.729
- And it's heavy.
(girls laughing)

26:36.863 --> 26:39.131
- Yeah, this might
do some damage.

26:39.265 --> 26:42.769
- Don't be so nervous, handsome.

26:42.902 --> 26:45.304
- That's the smartest
thing you've ever done.

26:47.206 --> 26:52.578
- Yeah, just relax.
- We don't bite.

26:52.712 --> 26:55.982
- Unless you want us to.
(girls laughing)

26:57.049 --> 27:00.653
- Ladies, ladies,
let the man see Zane.

27:00.787 --> 27:04.423
(faint instrumental music)

27:08.094 --> 27:09.128
- If you were as good with a gun

27:09.261 --> 27:10.196
as you are with that little toy,

27:10.329 --> 27:11.931
maybe my mom could
have used you.

27:12.064 --> 27:14.133
- [Johnny] Oh, she did, you
should ask her about it.

27:14.266 --> 27:16.669
- Yo, chill.

27:16.803 --> 27:18.104
- You should fuck
off and walk away.

27:18.237 --> 27:21.040
- She loved my yo-yo.
- Oh, my God.

27:21.173 --> 27:22.474
- She showed me some
of her tricks too.

27:22.608 --> 27:24.043
- I'll show you
some fucking tricks.

27:25.144 --> 27:26.345
You're fucking lucky
you piece of shit!

27:26.478 --> 27:28.280
- [Franklin] You stay here.

27:29.581 --> 27:30.649
- I'll take him back.

27:30.783 --> 27:32.985
- Thank you, thank you.
- Come on, man.

27:36.455 --> 27:38.891
(Zane snorting)

27:41.828 --> 27:43.930
- Oh, Jonah, hey!

27:44.063 --> 27:45.031
Thanks for coming.

27:45.164 --> 27:46.966
- You wanted to talk to me?

27:47.099 --> 27:49.869
- Talk? (laughs)

27:50.002 --> 27:51.403
Hey, why didn't you
offer him something?

27:51.537 --> 27:52.204
What do you want, kid?

27:52.338 --> 27:53.305
We got everything.

27:53.439 --> 27:55.141
- He said he didn't
want nothing.

27:55.274 --> 27:57.609
- (laughs) What, are you
turning me down already?

27:57.744 --> 27:59.311
That's not like you.

27:59.445 --> 28:00.612
- Maybe I'm not in
a celebrating mood,

28:00.747 --> 28:02.849
unlike you assholes.

28:02.982 --> 28:05.251
You forget about what
happened to my mom?

28:05.384 --> 28:07.319
You're acting like
it's business as usual.

28:09.321 --> 28:10.589
I didn't come here to party.

28:11.457 --> 28:14.126
So spit it the fuck
out what you want.

28:16.695 --> 28:19.565
- Whoo.
- Whoo.

28:19.698 --> 28:22.902
- Looks like somebody
finally grew a pair of balls.

28:25.805 --> 28:28.841
- And they dropped
today, God damn.

28:28.975 --> 28:32.745
- Hey, Jonah, did I introduce
you to my little baby sister,

28:32.879 --> 28:34.180
here, Sonya?

28:35.247 --> 28:36.282
- We've met.

28:36.415 --> 28:37.716
How are you, sweetheart?

28:37.850 --> 28:40.086
- Yeah, we've met.

28:41.687 --> 28:43.689
- Please give your
mom my regards.

28:43.823 --> 28:47.559
We never really hung out
too much, but Zane raves

28:47.693 --> 28:48.360
about her.

28:48.494 --> 28:49.561
- Does he?

28:49.695 --> 28:51.898
Sure has a funny
way of showing it.

28:52.164 --> 28:55.301
- Come on now, we only
got room for one prick

28:55.434 --> 28:57.569
in this family.
- You mean you?

28:58.805 --> 29:01.240
- (laughs) I told you,
he's good, isn't he?

29:02.308 --> 29:05.444
No, I meant that fuck nuts
brother of yours, Cain.

29:06.745 --> 29:10.316
Besides, we're not family yet.

29:10.449 --> 29:12.451
Speaking of which,

29:12.584 --> 29:14.420
why don't you give me
and little fast-talker

29:14.553 --> 29:16.122
over here some privacy?

29:16.255 --> 29:17.556
We'll have a little chat.

29:25.297 --> 29:28.334
Hey, see this?

29:28.467 --> 29:30.803
I don't like drinking alone,
so don't make me drink alone.

29:30.937 --> 29:32.371
- Fuck it, I'm already here.

29:35.842 --> 29:38.077
- (laughs) And he's back,
ladies and gentlemen,

29:38.210 --> 29:39.578
just like that.

29:39.711 --> 29:42.114
I was getting so worried there
you were getting soft on me.

29:43.782 --> 29:45.117
- What do you expect, man?

29:45.517 --> 29:47.219
- (laughs) I'm just kidding!

29:51.757 --> 29:52.791
- You haven't visited my mom,

29:52.925 --> 29:54.493
ever since she put
everything on hold.

29:54.626 --> 29:55.694
- Hm.

29:56.929 --> 29:58.998
- My brother and sister
are barely talking to me.

29:59.131 --> 30:00.732
I feel like I'm the
only one trying to

30:00.867 --> 30:03.269
make peace with everybody.

30:04.603 --> 30:07.239
- Why do you think
I called you here?

30:07.373 --> 30:09.141
- Who the fuck knows?

30:09.275 --> 30:10.642
You tell me.

30:10.776 --> 30:19.451
- Well, the fact is you are
one trustworthy motherfucker,

30:19.585 --> 30:22.321
(glass tapping)

30:22.454 --> 30:23.689
you always have been.

30:24.991 --> 30:31.130
- Yeah, and it cost
me being alienated

30:31.263 --> 30:32.364
from the rest of my family.

30:32.498 --> 30:34.666
- That's not really
your fault, exactly.

30:35.601 --> 30:38.804
Granted, those shit head
siblings of yours really do

30:38.938 --> 30:41.640
not appreciate you,
but your mother?

30:43.209 --> 30:45.511
She cares about you
more than anything.

30:47.013 --> 30:48.547
She knows you've been
there for her every beat.

30:48.680 --> 30:50.983
Shit, since she's been sick
you've been spending more

30:51.117 --> 30:52.518
time with her than I have.

30:52.651 --> 30:55.321
You're making me look like
a bad boyfriend over here!

30:59.625 --> 31:01.727
- What do you want from me?

31:02.861 --> 31:03.562
- What do I want?

31:03.695 --> 31:07.466
I want you.

31:09.335 --> 31:12.071
You're mother trusts
you more than anybody.

31:12.204 --> 31:14.573
If you pin me to
be next in line,

31:16.042 --> 31:18.244
I'm gonna make sure
you're appreciated.

31:18.877 --> 31:22.881
- So all this shit
was a fucking pitch?

31:23.015 --> 31:24.850
What the fuck do you think I am?

31:24.984 --> 31:27.186
My mom said she'd
make a decision.

31:28.054 --> 31:31.890
- And she chooses those two
shit head siblings of yours,

31:32.024 --> 31:33.659
what does that say about you?

31:33.792 --> 31:35.461
You think they give
a fuck about you?

31:36.328 --> 31:38.597
All they wanna do is scold you,

31:38.730 --> 31:41.900
tell you what to do, (whines).

31:42.768 --> 31:43.936
And me?

31:44.070 --> 31:47.373
When I'm the fucking
boss, no strings attached,

31:47.506 --> 31:49.241
you get anything you want.

31:49.375 --> 31:50.776
Teamwork.

31:50.909 --> 31:52.711
Quid pro quo, (speaks
in foreign language)?

31:57.016 --> 31:58.150
- I don't know, man.

32:01.687 --> 32:03.789
That's family we're
talking about.

32:03.922 --> 32:04.957
- Yeah, you're right.

32:05.091 --> 32:06.725
'Cause family is a
very special thing,

32:06.858 --> 32:08.094
it's a very fragile thing.

32:08.227 --> 32:08.894
You know why?

32:09.028 --> 32:10.362
'Cause it always changes,

32:10.496 --> 32:12.064
it's not always about blood,

32:12.198 --> 32:17.903
it's about protection, it's
about trust, you feel me?

32:19.038 --> 32:20.639
- I have to think about this.

32:22.441 --> 32:23.542
- Okay, okay, wait, wait, wait.

32:23.675 --> 32:27.746
You think, think very
hard, long and hard.

32:27.879 --> 32:35.754
But before you do that, there's
something I want us to do.

32:35.887 --> 32:40.292
(ominous instrumental music)

32:40.426 --> 32:42.294
Take a little ride.

32:42.728 --> 32:46.598
(laughs) You're gonna
love this, I promise.

32:48.134 --> 32:50.469
- You still haven't told
me where we're going.

32:51.103 --> 32:52.838
- Don't get all
serious on me now.

32:52.971 --> 32:54.673
Come on, it'll be a
quickie, it's gonna be fun.

32:54.806 --> 32:57.076
- You could at least
tell me what we're doing.

32:57.209 --> 32:58.477
- Look in the glove box.

33:01.347 --> 33:03.615
- Open up the glove box.

33:03.749 --> 33:05.217
- Why?

33:05.351 --> 33:08.154
- It's not gonna bite you,
just fucking open it up.

33:12.224 --> 33:13.825
- What, the gun?

33:14.793 --> 33:16.995
- Yeah, how does
it make you feel?

33:20.099 --> 33:21.400
- I have enough already.

33:24.070 --> 33:27.106
- Yeah, well you know a
gun is kinda like a cock.

33:27.239 --> 33:29.608
You don't take it out
unless you're gonna use it.

33:31.143 --> 33:33.145
- What do you want me to do?

33:33.279 --> 33:35.481
You know my mom
froze everything.

33:35.614 --> 33:38.217
We're not allowed to do
shit until she tells us to.

33:38.350 --> 33:41.353
- It has nothing to do with
that, it's its own thing.

33:41.487 --> 33:43.989
Only side gig,
there's no conflict.

33:52.298 --> 33:54.166
- Come on, man don't
be such a pussy.

33:54.300 --> 33:55.967
You can grab the gun.

33:56.502 --> 33:58.537
You're gonna have to
use it pretty soon.

34:01.707 --> 34:03.375
Fine, you know what then?

34:04.643 --> 34:07.779
You don't wanna grab the gun,
just grab under the seat.

34:07.913 --> 34:09.348
- Seriously?

34:09.481 --> 34:11.583
- Yeah, just grab under the
seat, I'm not fucking with you.

34:15.854 --> 34:17.456
- What the fuck is this?

34:17.589 --> 34:19.525
Cut the bullshit, what
are you trying to do?

34:21.360 --> 34:22.294
- It's 10K.

34:24.029 --> 34:26.198
It's half of what I'm
getting for this job,

34:26.332 --> 34:28.400
and it's all going to
you right fucking now.

34:29.535 --> 34:31.137
That's what I'm talking about.

34:32.971 --> 34:34.240
- What do I have to do?

34:34.873 --> 34:36.575
You know what, don't
even answer that.

34:36.708 --> 34:38.910
Just pull over and
I'll take an Uber back.

34:40.812 --> 34:42.881
Nobody gives anyone
a half gig's pay

34:43.014 --> 34:44.783
for not even setting
it up or anything.

34:44.916 --> 34:46.518
That's not how it works.

34:46.652 --> 34:47.886
- It does with us.

34:48.019 --> 34:49.054
Don't you get it?

34:49.188 --> 34:50.822
It's no more of this
backseat bullshit.

34:50.956 --> 34:53.559
This is teamwork I'm
talking about here.

34:53.692 --> 34:55.093
Come on.

34:55.227 --> 34:57.329
You take a gig, you
get paid for that gig,

34:57.463 --> 34:58.397
you get your fair share.

34:58.530 --> 35:00.232
That's what I'm talking about.

35:00.366 --> 35:01.467
You know what?

35:01.600 --> 35:04.270
Fuck it, I'll fucking
do the job myself, okay?

35:05.237 --> 35:07.373
Just be ready to rock
and roll when I come out.

35:07.506 --> 35:08.940
Take that money and
stuff it in your

35:09.074 --> 35:11.477
pants right now for
all I fucking care.

35:11.610 --> 35:13.812
It's like I said, we're
in this all or nothing.

35:13.945 --> 35:14.946
You know what I want.

35:15.080 --> 35:16.482
- Now I know you're
fucking with me.

35:18.950 --> 35:20.152
- Well, maybe next time,

35:20.286 --> 35:22.488
you'll actually wanna go
inside, and get some action.

35:22.621 --> 35:25.023
Maybe next time,
I'll get you an M60

35:25.157 --> 35:26.625
like you've been dreaming about.

35:26.758 --> 35:28.260
Get some high end gigs.

35:34.266 --> 35:35.634
Just get in the driver's seat.

35:35.767 --> 35:42.441
Be ready to rock and
roll, okay, okay?

35:43.875 --> 35:44.976
- [Jonah] I know, man.

35:45.877 --> 35:47.413
- [Zane] Keep the engine warm.

35:53.352 --> 35:56.988
(intense electronic music)

36:02.027 --> 36:06.498
(intense electronic
music continues)

36:11.303 --> 36:13.339
- Come on, motherfucker.

36:16.141 --> 36:19.110
- [Zane] Did anybody
order a pizza?

36:25.050 --> 36:28.587
(intense electronic
music continues)

36:28.720 --> 36:33.759
(gun firing)
(Zane cheering)

36:36.662 --> 36:39.865
(Zane laughing)
- Whoo!

36:39.998 --> 36:42.568
- Go, go, go, go, go, go!

36:42.701 --> 36:45.036
(laughs) Whoo!

36:45.170 --> 36:46.705
See what we fucking did?

36:46.838 --> 36:48.707
We did that, yeah.

36:48.840 --> 36:50.642
- You gonna tell me where
the fuck to go or what?

36:50.776 --> 36:52.544
- Keep going straight,
keep going straight.

36:52.678 --> 36:53.412
Wait, no, no, no.

36:53.545 --> 36:54.680
Slow down, slow down, slow down.

36:54.813 --> 36:56.181
You don't wanna make
too much attention.

36:56.315 --> 36:58.016
You've done this before, right?

36:58.149 --> 36:59.451
All right, make a left.

37:03.021 --> 37:04.590
- [Jonah] How many you take out?

37:04.723 --> 37:07.259
- Enough. (laughs)

37:07.393 --> 37:10.061
You should've seen the looks
on their fucking faces.

37:10.195 --> 37:11.763
- I don't get all this.

37:11.897 --> 37:13.064
Who paid you to do this?

37:13.198 --> 37:14.900
- It's my own side
thing, all right?

37:15.033 --> 37:16.001
It has nothing to
do with your mom.

37:16.134 --> 37:16.902
Don't worry about it.

37:17.035 --> 37:18.404
This is between us.

37:19.905 --> 37:21.340
That's okay, isn't it?

37:21.473 --> 37:23.342
- I still don't get this.

37:23.475 --> 37:24.543
If you're getting
all these jobs,

37:24.676 --> 37:26.211
why does it even fucking matter

37:26.345 --> 37:28.780
that you have my mom's business?

37:28.914 --> 37:30.949
- Do you like how much
money you just made?

37:32.618 --> 37:35.787
Fuck this, smell this?

37:35.921 --> 37:37.456
I love the smell of that.

37:37.589 --> 37:38.390
You like that?

37:38.524 --> 37:40.359
- Yeah, it's a shitload.

37:40.492 --> 37:42.361
- Do you know who
won't give you this?

37:42.494 --> 37:45.731
Your fucking brother
and your sister.

37:45.864 --> 37:49.968
It's like I always say, family
is not just about blood.

37:51.202 --> 37:53.905
(Zane laughing)

37:55.607 --> 37:59.110
(Zane sniffing)

37:59.244 --> 38:02.013
Just go straight
and do another left.

38:04.316 --> 38:05.183
Whoo!

38:08.487 --> 38:09.521
You love this, don't you?

38:09.655 --> 38:11.323
This is what I fucking live for!

38:13.525 --> 38:16.294
(cars whooshing)

38:22.033 --> 38:25.571
(cars continue whooshing)

38:27.105 --> 38:29.808
(guns rustling)

38:35.781 --> 38:39.317
(cars continue whooshing)

38:44.656 --> 38:48.193
(cars continue whooshing)

38:53.665 --> 38:57.202
(cars continue whooshing)

39:00.839 --> 39:03.875
(crickets chirping)

39:07.679 --> 39:10.549
(car approaching)

39:16.455 --> 39:19.224
(car stopping)

39:20.291 --> 39:23.161
(buckle rustling)

39:28.634 --> 39:31.503
(Jonah breathing)

39:32.971 --> 39:35.574
(bag rustling)

39:38.877 --> 39:41.680
(money rustling)

39:47.853 --> 39:50.489
(bag rustling)

39:53.459 --> 39:54.760
- Fuck.

40:00.766 --> 40:03.635
(Jonah breathing)

40:08.073 --> 40:10.942
(Jonah breathing)

40:17.849 --> 40:20.886
(crickets chirping)

40:23.421 --> 40:25.390
- What the fuck are you doing?

40:25.524 --> 40:27.258
- What the hell are you doing
all night with Zane, huh?

40:27.392 --> 40:28.894
Let me guess, partying it up?

40:29.027 --> 40:31.396
Getting all coked up, you
plotting fucking snake?

40:31.530 --> 40:33.499
- You don't know what the
fuck you're talking about.

40:33.632 --> 40:34.800
- Then enlighten me,

40:34.933 --> 40:36.434
'cause I can think of
only two fucking reasons

40:36.568 --> 40:37.335
why you're out with Zane.
- What?

40:37.469 --> 40:38.403
- You're getting coked up,

40:38.537 --> 40:40.639
or he's trying to
recruit your ass.

40:40.772 --> 40:42.440
- Get a fucking life.

40:42.574 --> 40:44.242
What I do shouldn't concern you.

40:44.375 --> 40:46.144
- It does when it concerns Mom.

40:47.546 --> 40:48.547
- What are you
even talking about?

40:48.680 --> 40:49.881
- Stop playing stupid, Jonah.

40:50.015 --> 40:51.416
You know Zane wants it all,

40:51.550 --> 40:53.652
and he's probably playing
your ass to get it.

40:53.785 --> 40:58.223
- Just fuck off and
go home, we're done.

40:58.356 --> 41:00.792
- Don't turn your back
on me, I'm not done.

41:00.926 --> 41:04.029
(men grunting)

41:04.162 --> 41:06.865
(Jonah gasping)

41:09.100 --> 41:11.036
- [Jonah] Give it to me.

41:11.169 --> 41:13.204
- What do we have here?

41:13.338 --> 41:14.640
A little payday
for a job tonight?

41:16.508 --> 41:17.976
You're a fucking snake.

41:19.110 --> 41:21.580
- Hand it the fuck over.

41:23.081 --> 41:24.583
- You gonna shoot me, Jonah?

41:27.252 --> 41:28.820
Well then do it, boo.

41:33.525 --> 41:35.727
Pull the trigger,
Jonah, do it.

41:38.597 --> 41:41.967
(whistles)
Nobody home.

41:45.436 --> 41:46.672
Pull the trigger, Jonah!

41:53.812 --> 41:55.647
That's why you'll never
leave this family.

41:57.115 --> 41:59.985
Enjoy your money, snake.

42:01.152 --> 42:03.889
- Don't fucking come back,
asshole.

42:08.059 --> 42:09.895
Piece of shit.

42:10.361 --> 42:14.165
(ominous instrumental music)

42:17.903 --> 42:20.806
(bottle rustling)

42:26.444 --> 42:29.214
(feet pattering)

42:34.986 --> 42:37.255
(no audio)

42:44.362 --> 42:46.632
(no audio)

42:53.839 --> 42:55.073
(bottle clanking)

42:55.206 --> 42:58.576
(ominous instrumental music)

43:00.679 --> 43:05.216
(punches thudding)
(glass breaking)

43:05.583 --> 43:07.385
- Listen up, motherfucker.

43:08.386 --> 43:10.321
I'm gonna keep this real simple.

43:11.189 --> 43:15.994
We see you around Jonah again,
we are going to kill you.

43:16.394 --> 43:17.963
We don't care what it's for.

43:18.830 --> 43:19.665
He doesn't want you around.

43:19.798 --> 43:21.499
He doesn't need around.

43:23.168 --> 43:24.703
We're his family now.

43:24.836 --> 43:28.139
- You hear that, motherfucker?
- Are we clear?

43:29.107 --> 43:30.441
- It might be more helpful

43:30.575 --> 43:33.544
if you guys play a game
of charades for me.

43:34.780 --> 43:36.281
Okay.

43:37.683 --> 43:39.350
Which one of you pussies
is holding my hair?

43:39.484 --> 43:42.153
I've had bitches pull
harder than that.

43:43.221 --> 43:44.923
- You motherfucking bitch!

43:45.056 --> 43:46.424
Do you hear him talking?

43:48.459 --> 43:50.729
- Are we clear?

43:51.797 --> 43:55.100
- There's only one thing
I'm not clear about.

43:55.233 --> 43:56.601
I just wanna know
who's gonna be sucking

43:56.735 --> 43:58.569
who's dick when
you're done with me.

44:01.039 --> 44:02.473
(punch thudding)

44:08.213 --> 44:10.615
(object slapping)

44:12.250 --> 44:14.352
(object thudding)

44:21.526 --> 44:24.295
- I'm just trying to teach
you a useful skill, Rebecca.

44:28.734 --> 44:31.202
(ominous instrumental music)

44:31.336 --> 44:33.004
Do it again.

44:34.105 --> 44:36.174
Just think of someone you hate.

44:36.307 --> 44:38.143
I like to think of your father.

44:43.381 --> 44:46.317
- What are you thinking
about, Mom, honestly?

44:46.451 --> 44:49.487
We're all splintered,
Cain's M.I.A.

44:49.620 --> 44:50.989
Your boy is nowhere.

44:51.122 --> 44:52.190
Even Jonah's quiet.

44:53.892 --> 44:54.893
Why do you think that is?

44:55.026 --> 44:57.963
- I have no idea.
Why don't you tell me?

45:01.532 --> 45:04.035
- You know what I always
admired about you?

45:04.169 --> 45:05.403
How smart you are.

45:06.204 --> 45:07.172
How you always know
what job to give

45:07.305 --> 45:08.639
the right person and everything.

45:10.141 --> 45:13.511
I'm telling yo, Zane's
giving you tunnel vision.

45:15.914 --> 45:17.615
- Excuse me?

45:17.749 --> 45:19.684
- I can't believe
how blind you are.

45:19.818 --> 45:21.552
You don't even see
what's happening.

45:23.989 --> 45:29.160
- Obviously not, so go
for it, enlighten me.

45:31.797 --> 45:33.698
- We all want to take over
for different reasons,

45:33.832 --> 45:36.334
but Zane is the only one
you cannot give it to.

45:38.569 --> 45:40.538
I know you care about
him, but he's not family.

45:41.406 --> 45:42.841
And he has other motives.

45:43.741 --> 45:47.078
- Is that so, and what are they?

45:48.513 --> 45:50.415
- You know, I don't even
care who gets it between us.

45:50.548 --> 45:52.984
But not Zane, mom,
fuck, not Zane.

45:53.118 --> 45:55.653
Jonah, at least he's loyal.

45:55.787 --> 45:58.389
- So, Jonah you trust right?

45:58.523 --> 46:00.058
- I think I'd say that, yeah.

46:01.192 --> 46:02.393
- Read it.

46:02.527 --> 46:04.595
- What is this?
- Just read it.

46:09.034 --> 46:10.135
- When did he send this?

46:10.268 --> 46:11.536
- [Isa] Just scroll
up, Becca, last night.

46:20.946 --> 46:22.447
- What are you gonna do?

46:22.580 --> 46:25.416
- Jonah's out, he wants Zane.

46:26.818 --> 46:28.920
Seems pretty straightforward.

46:29.054 --> 46:31.056
- Zane's fucking with his head.

46:31.189 --> 46:32.057
He got to him.

46:32.190 --> 46:33.558
He doesn't want this.

46:33.691 --> 46:35.660
- Well, one minute
he's trustworthy.

46:35.793 --> 46:37.495
And the next, you
don't believe him.

46:38.729 --> 46:40.598
Which is it, sweetheart?

46:42.433 --> 46:46.771
- What about me or Cain even?

46:49.574 --> 46:50.708
- What about you?

46:51.742 --> 46:53.211
- [Becca] Don't we get a say?

46:55.413 --> 46:58.283
- How often did you visit
me when I was recovering?

46:59.517 --> 47:01.286
Wanna take a guess?

47:03.288 --> 47:04.990
And how often was Jonah there?

47:06.491 --> 47:08.626
- What about Zane, was
he a frequent visitor?

47:08.759 --> 47:09.961
I don't wanna play
that bullshit game.

47:10.095 --> 47:12.130
- Okay, that may be the case,

47:12.263 --> 47:14.499
but the one person
who was there,

47:15.400 --> 47:16.834
the person that you,
yourself,

47:16.968 --> 47:19.837
said was the most trustworthy,
he told me who he wants,

47:21.039 --> 47:24.642
and it's not you, or Cain.

47:28.779 --> 47:30.415
Funny, isn't it?

47:32.483 --> 47:34.152
- You're making the
biggest mistake,

47:34.285 --> 47:35.853
and you don't even see it.

47:35.987 --> 47:38.523
That empire you spent
30 years building,

47:38.656 --> 47:40.125
you're just opening the gates,

47:40.258 --> 47:41.626
and letting the enemy
come in and just take

47:41.759 --> 47:42.827
whatever they want.

47:43.995 --> 47:46.231
Well done, Mom.
(hand slapping)

47:46.797 --> 47:47.598
- Get out.

47:47.732 --> 47:51.336
(ominous instrumental music)

47:55.873 --> 48:00.378
(ominous instrumental
music continues)

48:00.511 --> 48:03.314
(both sniffing)

48:03.448 --> 48:05.984
- Fuck, man.
(both cheering)

48:06.117 --> 48:07.852
- Good shit.

48:07.986 --> 48:11.722
Whoo, told ya,
best shit there is.

48:12.991 --> 48:14.993
- Better every fucking time.

48:16.995 --> 48:19.230
- Up my game, man, up my game.

48:19.364 --> 48:23.268
(soft instrumental music)

48:23.401 --> 48:25.636
- Were you guys good to
suck each other's dicks?

48:25.770 --> 48:27.272
Why didn't you save me some?

48:28.806 --> 48:32.477
- Sweet baby, Sonya, there is
more than enough to go around.

48:32.610 --> 48:35.346
- All I'm saying, is don't
start the party without me.

48:35.480 --> 48:37.082
I like to pace myself.

48:38.216 --> 48:39.684
- She really does.

48:40.851 --> 48:42.287
- She does?

48:47.658 --> 48:50.261
- You're making all kind
of gains, aren't ya?

48:50.695 --> 48:53.264
- You're the one you said,
"Keep it in the family."

48:54.966 --> 48:57.435
- He's a funny one, isn't he?

48:57.568 --> 48:59.737
He's a funny duck. (quacks)

48:59.870 --> 49:02.440
- Yeah?
(Zane quacking)

49:09.214 --> 49:11.116
- You wanna grab that for me?

49:14.452 --> 49:16.254
- Here, let me hold
it for you baby.

49:16.387 --> 49:17.722
- Yeah?

49:22.460 --> 49:24.829
- Fuck, where do you
get this shit, man?

49:26.464 --> 49:28.633
- Your mother introduced
me to all the suppliers,

49:28.766 --> 49:30.201
all the stash.

49:30.335 --> 49:32.303
How's is she feeling,
is she getting better?

49:32.937 --> 49:35.206
- What the fuck
did you just say?

49:35.340 --> 49:36.774
Why don't you go
ask her yourself?

49:36.907 --> 49:40.345
I'm already doing everything
you fucking want me to.

49:40.478 --> 49:42.080
Stop killing my buzz.

49:42.213 --> 49:44.149
We don't need to
talk about this shit.

49:46.217 --> 49:47.618
- Okay, man.

49:47.752 --> 49:49.620
- Turn that shit up.

49:49.754 --> 49:51.622
- You got it, we got shit to do-

49:51.756 --> 49:52.823
- Turn the shit up, man!

49:52.957 --> 49:55.393
- I'm turning it up, look.

49:55.526 --> 49:56.994
I wanna get the
ball rolling here.

49:57.128 --> 49:58.963
We got some business
to attend to.

49:59.097 --> 50:03.234
(soft instrumental
music continues)

50:03.368 --> 50:05.403
He got moves, huh?

50:05.536 --> 50:07.205
You been teaching
him a thing or two?

50:07.338 --> 50:09.440
(both cheering)

50:12.277 --> 50:17.182
All right, Jonah and the whale!

50:17.848 --> 50:19.317
- You gotta have some other
shit around here, man.

50:19.450 --> 50:21.186
What are you hiding
from me here?

50:25.723 --> 50:27.158
- No, no, no, no, no
don't touch those.

50:27.292 --> 50:29.394
You don't want
those, give 'em back.

50:29.527 --> 50:30.995
- Why is that?

50:31.129 --> 50:33.898
- They'll fuck you up slowly,
and not in a good way.

50:38.002 --> 50:39.237
- Then why do you have 'em?

50:40.838 --> 50:44.509
- Because I'm not in
a good way. (laughs)

50:44.642 --> 50:46.344
These are downers, you idiot.

50:46.477 --> 50:47.478
You want uppers.

50:47.612 --> 50:50.681
You wanna celebrate, elevate.

50:50.815 --> 50:52.683
- What are we
celebrating this time?

50:53.651 --> 50:56.254
- Us, family.

50:58.256 --> 51:01.226
- Family?
- Family.

51:02.527 --> 51:06.297
(ominous instrumental music)

51:10.735 --> 51:13.438
(door knocking)

51:18.543 --> 51:23.181
(ominous instrumental
music continues)

51:33.958 --> 51:35.793
- What the fuck?

51:36.561 --> 51:38.296
- It's not as bad as it looks.

51:38.429 --> 51:40.331
- Well it couldn't
be much worse.

51:40.465 --> 51:42.200
Get your sorry
fucking ass in here,

51:42.333 --> 51:44.235
before your neighbors
think I did it to you.

51:44.369 --> 51:45.736
- You got what I want or not?

51:45.870 --> 51:47.705
- Yeah it's over there.

51:47.838 --> 51:52.277
Come on, shut the door after
you, shut the fucking door.

51:52.410 --> 51:54.044
- Can I come in first?

51:55.413 --> 51:56.981
You want me to lock
it too, princess?

51:57.815 --> 51:58.949
Happy?

52:00.785 --> 52:01.919
- Are you happy?

52:05.723 --> 52:07.124
You know, your mom,

52:07.258 --> 52:08.793
she left a lot of
us out in the cold

52:08.926 --> 52:11.462
with her hiatus bullshit.

52:13.464 --> 52:15.900
- You can't find any other jobs?

52:16.033 --> 52:19.003
- Kid has feet in
a lot of things.

52:19.136 --> 52:22.273
Just getting this shit
was near impossible.

52:23.308 --> 52:26.677
Now, they're all clean,

52:27.878 --> 52:31.349
virtually, totally untraceable.

52:32.683 --> 52:36.821
Now, which one do you want?

52:39.590 --> 52:41.459
- [Caine] All of them.

52:44.094 --> 52:49.133
(ominous instrumental
music continues)

52:49.434 --> 52:51.001
- [Roddy] You could
walk into city hall,

52:51.135 --> 52:52.970
shoot the fuck out of the
place, and those dumb shits

52:53.103 --> 52:55.873
would not know who to trace.

52:59.644 --> 53:04.682
Tell me you're not using
these guns for jobs.

53:07.285 --> 53:08.653
Dude, look, I don't

53:08.786 --> 53:12.757
like him either
but he rolls deep,

53:12.890 --> 53:14.392
do not do this.

53:15.693 --> 53:17.495
- I know what I'm up against.

53:17.628 --> 53:20.498
- Yeah? If you know
what you're up against,

53:20.631 --> 53:23.468
you'll know to just
leave it the fuck alone.

53:23.601 --> 53:25.870
He's got it, uour
mother is recovering.

53:26.003 --> 53:28.506
Your sister and your brother
are fine now just leave it

53:28.639 --> 53:29.907
the fuck alone.

53:30.040 --> 53:34.612
- You want the money or not?
- Yeah.

53:35.513 --> 53:37.548
- Then keep your fucking
opinions to yourself,

53:37.682 --> 53:38.916
and give me the fucking guns.

53:39.049 --> 53:40.084
I didn't come here
for a pep talk,

53:40.217 --> 53:41.752
I came here to do business.

53:41.886 --> 53:45.590
- Look, I don't wanna watch
you do something stupid.

53:45.723 --> 53:48.726
Your mother has made her choice.

53:48.859 --> 53:50.495
I know it sucks, I
don't like it either.

53:50.628 --> 53:53.998
- Then why didn't you
say anything, huh?

53:55.165 --> 53:58.068
I know you hate Zane
just as much as I do.

53:58.202 --> 53:59.370
You've known my
mom for 30 years,

53:59.504 --> 54:01.105
30 fucking years, Roddy.

54:03.007 --> 54:05.310
You stood on the sideline
like a little bitch.

54:06.577 --> 54:11.115
- You know, you've always
had a big mouth kid.

54:11.248 --> 54:13.117
Let me tell you something,

54:13.250 --> 54:16.086
I'm not your brother,
and I'm not your sister.

54:16.220 --> 54:19.089
I don't take that shit from you,

54:19.223 --> 54:21.759
because I will make
what they did to you

54:21.892 --> 54:24.929
look like a fucking cakewalk.

54:26.997 --> 54:28.566
- They already took my brother.

54:29.934 --> 54:30.901
And Becca's out.

54:32.269 --> 54:34.772
And Ma, you know when
she makes a choice,

54:34.905 --> 54:37.308
she becomes a stubborn bitch.

54:38.643 --> 54:40.345
Doesn't change her mind.

54:40.478 --> 54:43.247
The little fucker took what
left I had and ran with it.

54:46.083 --> 54:46.951
This,

54:51.556 --> 54:53.758
this is all I know, Roddy.

54:55.426 --> 54:57.395
And I'm not gonna bend
a fucking knee to him,

54:57.528 --> 54:58.596
and I know you aren't either,

54:58.729 --> 55:00.331
qnd that's why we're doing this.

55:01.866 --> 55:05.936
- I'm asking you take your
stuff and get out now.

55:08.406 --> 55:12.877
I'll keep this, I'll help
you get into your car.

55:13.010 --> 55:15.312
- You don't get it, do you?

55:16.180 --> 55:18.483
When I said, "We're doing this,"

55:19.917 --> 55:22.953
I meant we are doing this.

55:24.589 --> 55:26.190
How long has it been, Roddy?

55:28.058 --> 55:29.527
- What are you talking about?

55:31.295 --> 55:34.098
- You know, I remember
hearing it on the news.

55:34.231 --> 55:37.468
I knew something didn't add up.

55:37.602 --> 55:39.404
I know him well too.

55:39.537 --> 55:42.573
If Zane would have been doing
his fucking job that day,

55:42.707 --> 55:44.709
shit would have gone
down differently.

55:46.343 --> 55:49.580
Maybe, if Sabina-

55:49.714 --> 55:52.149
- No, no, no, no.

55:52.282 --> 55:55.853
You never say that word to me.

55:57.321 --> 56:00.458
You're just a fucking
snake like Zane,

56:00.591 --> 56:02.593
except you try to
hide it better,

56:03.761 --> 56:05.530
'cause you know I have
a love for your mother,

56:05.663 --> 56:09.400
and this family, but you're
still a fucking snake.

56:10.735 --> 56:15.339
You use my own blood,
and what happened,

56:15.473 --> 56:19.209
to get me to work with you.

56:19.343 --> 56:22.913
I should just fucking do you
right now, you son of a bitch.

56:23.047 --> 56:26.350
It might stop a lot of
shit that's gonna go down.

56:28.152 --> 56:30.254
- I'd be the happiest boy
in the world right now,

56:30.387 --> 56:34.425
if you pulled that trigger,
but you ain't gonna.

56:36.060 --> 56:37.161
- Getting rid of you?

56:37.294 --> 56:41.966
Oh, that would be
so fucking easy.

56:45.035 --> 56:45.903
- Nate.

56:49.406 --> 56:50.941
That's what I thought.

56:52.176 --> 56:54.211
You ain't gonna,
because of my family.

56:55.813 --> 57:00.384
(ominous instrumental
music continues)

57:02.052 --> 57:05.022
We both know I'm a prick,
that doesn't change anything.

57:06.390 --> 57:07.625
There are lines you don't cross.

57:07.758 --> 57:09.627
You know it and I know it.

57:10.427 --> 57:12.162
Zane doesn't give a fuck.

57:13.097 --> 57:14.499
He'll take any part
of our families,

57:14.632 --> 57:16.667
and use them as pawns in
his little fucking games.

57:16.801 --> 57:17.802
He's already torn yours apart,

57:17.935 --> 57:18.903
and now he's working on mine,

57:19.036 --> 57:20.437
and I can't let that happen.

57:20.571 --> 57:21.772
I know there are times
where it looks like,

57:21.906 --> 57:23.608
I don't give a fuck.

57:24.441 --> 57:27.878
I do half-assed jobs, I show
up late, I rib on Jonah.

57:29.547 --> 57:32.750
But I'd never turn my
back on them, ever!

57:34.719 --> 57:36.954
Because that's my
fucking family.

57:39.356 --> 57:40.791
Now I can't prove it,

57:41.792 --> 57:44.962
but it sure as hell ain't a
coincidence that Zane shows up,

57:45.095 --> 57:47.097
and people start
dying left and right,

57:47.231 --> 57:49.634
and all of a sudden, he
starts rising to the top.

57:51.135 --> 57:52.970
I fucking need you, Roddy.

57:55.973 --> 57:59.744
You can't let this scumbag
end my family, you just can't.

58:05.082 --> 58:07.451
- We're done, now.

58:08.285 --> 58:12.890
(ominous instrumental
music continues)

58:17.327 --> 58:21.966
(ominous instrumental
music continues)

58:26.671 --> 58:31.308
(ominous instrumental
music continues)

58:32.777 --> 58:35.512
- I want you to think about
every job that you've done,

58:36.914 --> 58:39.283
every single time that
you've worked with Zane,

58:41.118 --> 58:42.687
just really think about it,

58:44.354 --> 58:45.856
and then you tell
me whether or not

58:45.990 --> 58:47.524
you think I'm lying about him.

58:54.164 --> 58:56.767
(door slamming)

58:56.901 --> 58:59.704
(feet pattering)

59:03.173 --> 59:05.643
(gun firing)

59:07.945 --> 59:09.714
- No, no, no, please.

59:12.516 --> 59:14.118
Please, ah, no, no.

59:15.586 --> 59:17.021
(gun firing)

59:17.154 --> 59:20.124
- (laughs) Nicely done.

59:21.325 --> 59:23.861
- [Jonah] You're
not so bad yourself.

59:23.994 --> 59:26.631
(phone ringing)

59:28.332 --> 59:29.199
- Shit.

59:30.635 --> 59:33.437
Yo. No, no, no, perfect timing.

59:33.570 --> 59:35.840
Yeah, just come up to the
door, and I'll let you in.

59:35.973 --> 59:38.175
Do the secret knock, all right.

59:39.509 --> 59:40.745
- Who the hell was that?

59:40.878 --> 59:41.746
- That's the last
piece of the puzzle.

59:41.879 --> 59:43.180
- Coming here?

59:43.313 --> 59:44.815
You couldn't have
picked a better spot?

59:44.949 --> 59:45.916
- It's the perfect spot.

59:46.050 --> 59:47.384
5-0 doesn't know we're here.

59:47.517 --> 59:48.986
Nobody knows we're here.

59:49.119 --> 59:52.089
These guys certainly don't
know we're fucking here.

59:52.222 --> 59:54.659
- Still, man, I don't
like dicking around after-

59:54.792 --> 59:56.326
- Hey, relax, it'll be quick.

59:56.460 --> 59:58.095
Plus, you already know this guy.

01:00:00.097 --> 01:00:02.900
(feet pattering)

01:00:05.402 --> 01:00:07.204
- What the fuck, man.

01:00:11.008 --> 01:00:13.778
(feet pattering)

01:00:17.314 --> 01:00:20.851
(feet continue pattering)

01:00:26.490 --> 01:00:29.459
(clothes rustling)

01:00:33.731 --> 01:00:37.067
(feet pattering)

01:00:37.201 --> 01:00:39.403
- (laughs) Looks
like we're getting

01:00:39.536 --> 01:00:42.306
the band back together.
- Roddy?

01:00:44.141 --> 01:00:46.476
- Well, it looks
like you two boys

01:00:46.610 --> 01:00:48.512
are having way too much fun.

01:00:49.613 --> 01:00:51.148
- What are you doing here?

01:00:51.281 --> 01:00:52.717
- I was invited.

01:00:52.850 --> 01:00:54.618
- Yeah, I figured we
can't complete our team

01:00:54.752 --> 01:00:58.555
without our MVP clean-up
man on the crew.

01:00:58.689 --> 01:01:00.357
- Where have you been, man?

01:01:00.490 --> 01:01:02.793
- I've been keeping my head
down like everyone else.

01:01:02.927 --> 01:01:04.128
- It's about to
get a lot busier,

01:01:04.261 --> 01:01:06.463
because we gotta
talk some business.

01:01:06.596 --> 01:01:08.799
- Why did you bring me here,

01:01:08.933 --> 01:01:10.600
to just go up there,

01:01:10.735 --> 01:01:13.037
and clean up that
mess, seriously?

01:01:14.404 --> 01:01:15.840
- Think bigger.

01:01:17.274 --> 01:01:19.844
- OH you mean you've
got lots of rooms

01:01:19.977 --> 01:01:21.879
up there with lots of
bodies and I'm gonna

01:01:22.012 --> 01:01:23.580
clean up all of them?

01:01:24.481 --> 01:01:27.417
- I'm talking about doing
this full time again,

01:01:27.551 --> 01:01:28.552
going all in.

01:01:30.020 --> 01:01:32.189
You think the last 30 years
have been good to you?

01:01:32.322 --> 01:01:33.891
You ain't seen nothing yet.

01:01:36.193 --> 01:01:37.394
- Does Isa want this?

01:01:38.763 --> 01:01:40.330
- We all want this.

01:01:40.464 --> 01:01:42.132
- Who the fuck is we?

01:01:42.266 --> 01:01:47.004
- Her boy, for one,
herself, another.

01:01:47.137 --> 01:01:49.673
And I figure a ringing
endorsement from the living

01:01:49.807 --> 01:01:54.378
legend himself, could
only seal the deal.

01:01:54.511 --> 01:01:55.946
- Oh, right.

01:01:56.080 --> 01:02:00.517
You know, you two were
doing so well without me.

01:02:00.650 --> 01:02:02.686
What happened?

01:02:02.820 --> 01:02:05.555
Don't tell me, of course.

01:02:06.490 --> 01:02:09.927
You need that last endorsement.

01:02:10.060 --> 01:02:13.697
Then you'll get
it, the holy bible.

01:02:15.199 --> 01:02:18.402
- I thought you said
she gave you the bible.

01:02:18.535 --> 01:02:20.871
- Basically, she already did.

01:02:21.005 --> 01:02:22.372
We're all good.

01:02:22.506 --> 01:02:25.042
All I'm doing here
is making sure anyone

01:02:25.175 --> 01:02:28.478
who has been loyal
is paid there due.

01:02:31.515 --> 01:02:36.020
- Zane, out of all
your wondrous talents,

01:02:36.987 --> 01:02:40.757
listening to you
trying to convince me,

01:02:40.891 --> 01:02:45.930
is like listening to
a sloppy-assed old
used car salesman

01:02:46.931 --> 01:02:48.398
try to sell me something.

01:02:49.433 --> 01:02:52.569
- You know I just did
15 people upstairs,

01:02:52.702 --> 01:02:55.906
so pardon me if I'm not
speaking eloquently right now.

01:02:56.040 --> 01:03:00.144
- Oh, I'm sorry, oh, did
I upset the little boy?

01:03:00.277 --> 01:03:03.147
- Come on you're a fucking
numbers guy anyway.

01:03:03.280 --> 01:03:05.315
Right, fuck my wordage.

01:03:05.449 --> 01:03:07.751
Tell him, Jonah.

01:03:07.885 --> 01:03:10.587
I've upped everybody
who's been loyal to Isa

01:03:10.720 --> 01:03:12.789
who is now loyal to me.

01:03:12.923 --> 01:03:16.660
- Is this right, Zane's
looking after you?

01:03:16.793 --> 01:03:20.597
(ominous instrumental music)

01:03:21.465 --> 01:03:23.333
- Yeah.

01:03:25.402 --> 01:03:26.603
- You haven't seen
much of your family,

01:03:26.736 --> 01:03:28.272
since your mother
got ill, have you?

01:03:31.608 --> 01:03:33.110
- What are you talking about?

01:03:34.478 --> 01:03:36.013
I'm with family right now.

01:03:37.948 --> 01:03:39.049
- My boy.

01:03:40.217 --> 01:03:42.752
- I guess you want me to
work for you exclusively,

01:03:43.921 --> 01:03:47.324
so that I will give this
wonderful endorsement.

01:03:47.457 --> 01:03:49.326
- She sees you give
me the thumbs up,

01:03:49.459 --> 01:03:50.928
she gives me the
rest of the numbers.

01:03:51.061 --> 01:03:52.362
That's all I need.

01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:57.367
- You know what?

01:03:59.336 --> 01:04:01.005
I need time to digest this.

01:04:01.138 --> 01:04:02.973
It's just too much information.

01:04:04.508 --> 01:04:07.677
I'll clean up the room upstairs
for you like I said I would.

01:04:08.545 --> 01:04:10.347
- Don't you wanna
hear the numbers?

01:04:11.448 --> 01:04:14.118
- I'm sure you'll pay
me what it's worth.

01:04:14.251 --> 01:04:16.186
Look, I got a lot of shit
in the truck I've gotta

01:04:16.320 --> 01:04:18.455
bring in here so I'm gonna
go out and get it, all right?

01:04:18.588 --> 01:04:21.058
- Hey, you're
doing a good thing.

01:04:21.191 --> 01:04:22.059
It's a good call.

01:04:22.993 --> 01:04:24.628
You're on the right team again.

01:04:26.030 --> 01:04:31.068
- Yeah, I'll be back.

01:04:34.538 --> 01:04:37.541
(Zane laughing)

01:04:37.674 --> 01:04:38.608
- We're good to go.

01:04:38.742 --> 01:04:40.244
We're golden, you see that?

01:04:40.377 --> 01:04:42.879
He's in, right?

01:04:43.013 --> 01:04:46.350
- Yeah. I think he's
gonna endorse you.

01:04:47.217 --> 01:04:50.387
- (laughs) We're gonna
celebrate tonight.

01:04:50.520 --> 01:04:51.888
We're gonna have a party.

01:04:52.022 --> 01:04:54.891
My sister is in my
house waiting for you.

01:04:56.393 --> 01:04:58.528
- That sounds great.

01:04:58.662 --> 01:05:00.064
But I think I'm a bit tired.

01:05:00.197 --> 01:05:02.232
I'm probably just
gonna go back home

01:05:02.366 --> 01:05:04.068
and pass the fuck out, okay?

01:05:04.901 --> 01:05:07.637
- Well, hey, look, if
you change your mind,

01:05:07.771 --> 01:05:09.706
we'll be going all night.

01:05:12.709 --> 01:05:17.714
- Yeah? You gonna finally
invite my mom over too?

01:05:19.984 --> 01:05:21.051
- What's the matter?

01:05:22.019 --> 01:05:24.788
You're getting a little
testy there, aren't ya?

01:05:24.921 --> 01:05:26.690
- Nah, I'm just a little
out of it right now.

01:05:26.823 --> 01:05:31.561
I'm sorry, we'll talk
later, all right?

01:05:36.200 --> 01:05:40.004
(ominous instrumental
music continues)

01:05:40.137 --> 01:05:42.139
- Well, that was interesting.

01:05:43.740 --> 01:05:46.543
(birds chirping)

01:05:52.949 --> 01:05:55.652
(door slamming)

01:05:58.188 --> 01:05:59.789
- Well if you're
going to stand there,

01:05:59.923 --> 01:06:02.959
and stare, do you want to
help me while you're doing it?

01:06:05.562 --> 01:06:08.198
- Yeah, sorry.

01:06:08.332 --> 01:06:11.635
- So you and Zane, eh?

01:06:11.768 --> 01:06:14.338
- I haven't thought it
would happen either.

01:06:14.471 --> 01:06:15.305
Didn't think he'd want
me as his right-hand

01:06:15.439 --> 01:06:16.840
man out of everybody.

01:06:18.142 --> 01:06:20.144
- You ever thought
to ask yourself why?

01:06:22.279 --> 01:06:24.448
- It's going good so far.

01:06:25.382 --> 01:06:28.018
He's taking good care of
me. Better than I ever was.

01:06:30.487 --> 01:06:33.123
- So Zane's now your family?

01:06:37.461 --> 01:06:38.462
He's looking after you?

01:06:38.595 --> 01:06:40.364
- You know what I mean.

01:06:40.497 --> 01:06:41.731
- No, I don't.

01:06:43.467 --> 01:06:46.536
- Look, you and I don't
know each other very well,

01:06:46.670 --> 01:06:48.138
with you mostly
taking care of all the

01:06:48.272 --> 01:06:50.607
shit after-the-fact,
but let me fill you in,

01:06:50.740 --> 01:06:54.478
my brother, my sister, they
don't give a fuck about me,

01:06:56.246 --> 01:06:57.114
they never did.

01:06:58.282 --> 01:07:03.087
So yeah, it feels good
for a change to finally

01:07:03.220 --> 01:07:04.688
have somebody who puts me out

01:07:04.821 --> 01:07:09.093
on the line for
nothing in return.

01:07:09.226 --> 01:07:10.894
- Nothing in return, eh?

01:07:11.861 --> 01:07:15.099
You know, he gets
a lot in return.

01:07:15.232 --> 01:07:18.202
If you can convince
me to roll over,

01:07:18.335 --> 01:07:23.373
and go to Isa and tell her
that he's the one. (laughs)

01:07:24.808 --> 01:07:26.042
- Whatever, man.

01:07:26.843 --> 01:07:28.578
You do whatever
the fuck you want.

01:07:29.679 --> 01:07:31.148
Zane's offering you gold,

01:07:31.281 --> 01:07:33.250
and you'd be a dumb
fuck for not taking it.

01:07:35.552 --> 01:07:37.221
- Seen your brother lately?

01:07:39.389 --> 01:07:40.590
- What did you say?

01:07:42.826 --> 01:07:47.697
- It's a simple question,
have you seen Cain lately?

01:07:49.233 --> 01:07:51.401
- Not since the
prick ambushed me.

01:07:52.369 --> 01:07:54.371
- Well I guess he
learned his lesson then.

01:07:54.504 --> 01:07:56.440
Did you happen to
see him after that?

01:07:56.573 --> 01:07:58.041
- No.

01:07:58.175 --> 01:07:59.709
- So he hasn't tried to
hit you up for anything?

01:07:59.843 --> 01:08:02.112
- No, he hasn't.

01:08:03.713 --> 01:08:05.115
What the fuck's your point?

01:08:06.250 --> 01:08:07.317
- He's alert.

01:08:07.451 --> 01:08:08.885
He knows what's going on.

01:08:09.018 --> 01:08:12.055
He knows not to fuck
with people in power.

01:08:14.724 --> 01:08:16.726
I gotta go.

01:08:16.860 --> 01:08:17.861
The boss wants me.

01:08:17.994 --> 01:08:19.263
I've gotta do things for him.

01:08:20.530 --> 01:08:25.402
You, take care of yourself.

01:08:29.038 --> 01:08:31.741
- Fuck.

01:08:31.875 --> 01:08:34.644
(birds chirping)

01:08:37.647 --> 01:08:40.450
(cars whooshing)

01:08:42.652 --> 01:08:45.189
(car beeping)

01:08:46.890 --> 01:08:49.659
(engine revving)

01:08:52.996 --> 01:08:55.699
(car whooshing)

01:09:00.970 --> 01:09:03.139
- That for me.

01:09:07.811 --> 01:09:10.980
Mm.

01:09:11.114 --> 01:09:14.518
That's good.
(phone ringing)

01:09:15.719 --> 01:09:16.986
Jonah?

01:09:17.120 --> 01:09:17.954
- Hey, Kenny.

01:09:18.087 --> 01:09:19.155
Sorry, I got held up.

01:09:19.289 --> 01:09:20.324
What's up with Isa?

01:09:21.225 --> 01:09:22.859
- I got the test results back.

01:09:23.827 --> 01:09:28.332
It was negative, there's
nothing wrong with her, yeah.

01:09:28.465 --> 01:09:32.035
Whoever did it, it
was intentional.

01:09:32.168 --> 01:09:33.303
No accident.

01:09:34.238 --> 01:09:39.243
It had to be someone close to
her, someone in the circle.

01:09:40.644 --> 01:09:42.078
I know.

01:09:42.212 --> 01:09:44.214
The best action now is
to keep getting her rest,

01:09:44.348 --> 01:09:47.217
and to keep me posted. Let me
know if she needs anything.

01:09:48.785 --> 01:09:51.488
(Jonah panting)

01:09:54.891 --> 01:09:57.861
(car beeping)

01:09:57.994 --> 01:10:00.730
(door slamming)

01:10:00.864 --> 01:10:02.599
- [Franklin] Take
in the nose, like,

01:10:02.732 --> 01:10:05.235
what's up with that shit?

01:10:05.369 --> 01:10:07.070
Hey, let's go.
- Hey.

01:10:07.203 --> 01:10:08.472
- What's up,
brother, what's good?

01:10:08.605 --> 01:10:09.873
- Hey.
- Y'all ready?

01:10:10.006 --> 01:10:12.242
Aye, let's do a
big one right here.

01:10:12.376 --> 01:10:13.810
Let's get it.
- Cheers.

01:10:13.943 --> 01:10:15.812
- [Franklin] Even
though we did that.

01:10:16.846 --> 01:10:19.249
- So why's your brother
hanging out with Jonah so much?

01:10:19.383 --> 01:10:20.984
- Yeah, don't tell
me you both actually

01:10:21.117 --> 01:10:22.986
like doing jobs with him.

01:10:23.119 --> 01:10:24.854
- I told y'all not
to say anything.

01:10:25.722 --> 01:10:28.325
- Why don't you two mind
your own fucking business?

01:10:29.225 --> 01:10:30.760
Don't forget where you are.

01:10:32.496 --> 01:10:34.664
- Don't make us throw
y'all asses out of here,

01:10:34.798 --> 01:10:36.266
saying some shit like that.

01:10:40.870 --> 01:10:42.406
- Time to bounce.

01:10:44.374 --> 01:10:45.442
Did you hear me?

01:10:45.575 --> 01:10:47.977
I said get the fuck out of here!

01:10:48.111 --> 01:10:50.547
Take your girlfriends,
find a nice view,

01:10:50.680 --> 01:10:52.716
maybe roll down a fucking hill!

01:10:52.849 --> 01:10:54.384
Get some grass stains.

01:10:54.518 --> 01:10:56.152
Go!
- Yo, what happened?

01:10:56.286 --> 01:10:57.621
- Do we really gotta go though?

01:10:57.754 --> 01:11:01.491
We just ordered hot wings.
- Hot wings?

01:11:01.625 --> 01:11:02.792
I wanna be alone!

01:11:04.528 --> 01:11:06.596
Don't sit, stand, and then walk.

01:11:06.730 --> 01:11:08.298
- Come on, y'all.

01:11:08.432 --> 01:11:11.034
- Get the fuck out, go, go!

01:11:16.873 --> 01:11:17.907
Fuck.

01:11:19.175 --> 01:11:20.944
- You gonna kick me out too?

01:11:22.111 --> 01:11:23.913
- Fucking wish I could.

01:11:27.684 --> 01:11:29.986
This has nothing to
do with that old fuck.

01:11:32.389 --> 01:11:33.557
- Where's Jonah?

01:11:34.391 --> 01:11:36.493
- He decided to
take the night off.

01:11:37.761 --> 01:11:39.596
- That doesn't sound like him.

01:11:39.729 --> 01:11:42.298
- Everybody's acting a
little odd around here.

01:11:48.438 --> 01:11:53.477
- Okay, what's going
on, hmm, what is it?

01:11:54.277 --> 01:11:56.012
- I lose him, I lose everything.

01:11:58.247 --> 01:11:59.983
- What are you
talking about, huh?

01:12:01.150 --> 01:12:04.454
What is it?
- Nothing, nothing.

01:12:04.588 --> 01:12:06.122
Just thinking out loud, okay?

01:12:10.960 --> 01:12:13.830
- You told me once we had
him, the rest would follow.

01:12:13.963 --> 01:12:17.934
So what the fuck do I need
to do to unfuck this, huh?

01:12:18.067 --> 01:12:18.935
Tell me!

01:12:20.504 --> 01:12:22.205
- Keep your legs open.

01:12:22.338 --> 01:12:23.540
- Fuck you.

01:12:23.673 --> 01:12:25.875
- You little fucking shit.

01:12:27.577 --> 01:12:28.845
- How dare you.

01:12:30.279 --> 01:12:35.318
Look, I just know how
close we are to this.

01:12:35.519 --> 01:12:40.023
And I know how hard you've
been busting your ass.

01:12:40.156 --> 01:12:43.393
We just can't give up
right now, we can't.

01:12:44.694 --> 01:12:45.562
- I know.

01:12:46.663 --> 01:12:49.065
- Okay, then what
are you gonna do?

01:12:49.198 --> 01:12:50.734
I need to know the plan.
- Shut up!

01:12:56.005 --> 01:12:57.741
- Here, let me-
- I got it!

01:13:04.247 --> 01:13:06.049
- Are those Tic Tacs?

01:13:08.384 --> 01:13:13.423
- He knows.
(ominous instrumental music)

01:13:16.025 --> 01:13:18.728
(guns rustling)

01:13:19.963 --> 01:13:22.666
(Becca sighing)

01:13:26.169 --> 01:13:29.072
(guns rustling)

01:13:29.205 --> 01:13:30.173
- I'm helping you out,

01:13:30.306 --> 01:13:33.342
but then you're on your own.

01:13:39.415 --> 01:13:41.117
Cain, do you hear me?

01:13:43.419 --> 01:13:44.387
You're going solo.

01:13:47.691 --> 01:13:50.393
(guns rustling)

01:13:53.763 --> 01:13:56.566
(birds chirping)

01:14:02.539 --> 01:14:06.576
(birds continue chirping)

01:14:06.710 --> 01:14:09.412
(car whooshing)

01:14:13.249 --> 01:14:18.287
(door slamming)
(intense instrumental music)

01:14:20.423 --> 01:14:25.461
(door knocking)
(people faintly speaking)

01:14:25.795 --> 01:14:26.896
- Mom you there?
- Jonah, what are you-

01:14:27.030 --> 01:14:28.632
- Come on, open up!

01:14:30.734 --> 01:14:33.837
- Oh my, God, Jonah, it's
two o'clock in the morning.

01:14:33.970 --> 01:14:35.271
Can't this wait?

01:14:35.404 --> 01:14:37.006
- You weren't picking
up your phone.

01:14:37.140 --> 01:14:38.274
We need to talk now.

01:14:38.407 --> 01:14:40.009
There's something
you need to know.

01:14:41.477 --> 01:14:42.846
- Sweetie, now's
just not a good time.

01:14:42.979 --> 01:14:44.681
- No it can't wait, Mom.

01:14:45.782 --> 01:14:47.316
- You doing okay, babe?
- Yeah.

01:14:47.450 --> 01:14:51.287
Uh, just trying to figure
out what's going on.

01:14:51.420 --> 01:14:52.355
- What is going on,
what is going on?

01:14:54.691 --> 01:14:56.159
- [Isa] Knock it off.

01:14:56.292 --> 01:14:59.128
- What is going on Jonah?

01:14:59.262 --> 01:15:00.496
Jonah!

01:15:00.630 --> 01:15:02.566
- What are you doing here?

01:15:02.699 --> 01:15:04.067
- Why are you here?

01:15:04.200 --> 01:15:05.468
Yes, that's a very
good question.

01:15:05.602 --> 01:15:07.336
He, uh, he surprised
me and stopped

01:15:07.470 --> 01:15:09.839
by, and by the way,
it's about time,

01:15:09.973 --> 01:15:11.875
because if it had
been one more day,

01:15:12.008 --> 01:15:14.077
I would have had you...

01:15:14.210 --> 01:15:17.581
(Isa laughing)
(Zane murmuring)

01:15:17.714 --> 01:15:19.348
- Stop it.
- I've been so busy, baby.

01:15:19.482 --> 01:15:21.217
I've been so busy.

01:15:21.350 --> 01:15:23.519
I just had to make the
time and finally come

01:15:23.653 --> 01:15:25.354
and do what's right.

01:15:27.824 --> 01:15:31.861
- Okay, knock it off my
son is right here, stop.

01:15:33.029 --> 01:15:34.197
- Enough about us.

01:15:35.932 --> 01:15:38.167
What are you doing here?

01:15:38.301 --> 01:15:41.170
You got any news
to share with us?

01:15:42.471 --> 01:15:44.674
- I guess not, we can
talk about it tomorrow.

01:15:44.808 --> 01:15:47.376
- Jonah, you look
like you're in shock.

01:15:47.510 --> 01:15:51.047
I know this is confusing,
and believe me, I was ready

01:15:51.180 --> 01:15:52.716
to break up with
this son of a bitch.

01:15:52.849 --> 01:15:54.383
- Who are you calling bitch?

01:15:54.517 --> 01:15:58.087
Who are you calling bitch?
- Oh, stop it.

01:16:00.857 --> 01:16:03.627
He came over tonight,
and I don't know.

01:16:05.595 --> 01:16:07.130
We just worked everything out.

01:16:08.264 --> 01:16:10.533
- I'm sorry for
coming over so late.

01:16:10.667 --> 01:16:12.301
There are still things we
need to talk about, Mom,

01:16:12.435 --> 01:16:16.205
that I think you would
want to know, alone.

01:16:17.874 --> 01:16:19.408
- Okay, Jonah.

01:16:19.542 --> 01:16:21.577
I'm running around like
crazy tomorrow morning,

01:16:21.711 --> 01:16:24.113
but how about you come over

01:16:24.247 --> 01:16:26.515
before I go over to
Zane's, does that work?

01:16:27.851 --> 01:16:29.352
- What's going down tomorrow?

01:16:30.153 --> 01:16:31.755
- Oh I didn't tell him.
- You didn't tell him?

01:16:31.888 --> 01:16:32.689
- No, I didn't.

01:16:32.822 --> 01:16:34.523
Do you want to tell him?

01:16:34.658 --> 01:16:35.859
- Yeah, maybe I
should break the news.

01:16:35.992 --> 01:16:37.526
- Okay.

01:16:37.661 --> 01:16:40.563
- We're gathering together
in a holy union of sorts.

01:16:41.597 --> 01:16:44.133
A proverbial passing
of the bible.

01:16:46.369 --> 01:16:47.370
- Is that true, Mom?

01:16:48.404 --> 01:16:51.240
- Yeah. We finally
made a decision.

01:16:52.108 --> 01:16:53.609
I don't know.

01:16:53.743 --> 01:16:54.744
He told me how he's
taking you under his wing,

01:16:54.878 --> 01:16:57.613
and you're like a son to him.

01:16:57.747 --> 01:17:00.817
It just feels right.

01:17:01.818 --> 01:17:05.288
So tomorrow, I'm gonna
give him the business,

01:17:05.421 --> 01:17:06.923
and we're gonna
have a little party

01:17:07.056 --> 01:17:08.591
at his house to celebrate.

01:17:08.725 --> 01:17:09.592
- At his house?

01:17:11.594 --> 01:17:14.030
Why don't we have it
here, at your place?

01:17:14.163 --> 01:17:19.202
I think it's more fitting,
and Zane is such a gentleman.

01:17:20.403 --> 01:17:22.105
I'm sure he'll be okay with it.

01:17:22.238 --> 01:17:23.940
- [Isa] That could be good
too, what do you think, honey?

01:17:24.073 --> 01:17:26.776
- We'll have a real celebration.

01:17:27.877 --> 01:17:29.078
- Okay, honey.

01:17:30.413 --> 01:17:32.782
- My sister's setting up
all the chairs at my house.

01:17:32.916 --> 01:17:36.485
- It makes so much more
sense to have it here.

01:17:36.619 --> 01:17:40.423
I can even bring him
little present tomorrow.

01:17:41.825 --> 01:17:43.793
We gotta have all eyes on Zane.

01:17:43.927 --> 01:17:44.794
- Okay.

01:17:46.429 --> 01:17:48.097
- You deserve it after all.

01:17:49.398 --> 01:17:50.800
- Jonah, I think
it's a great idea.

01:17:50.934 --> 01:17:52.836
I love the sight of you.

01:17:52.969 --> 01:17:54.337
Sweetheart, just go
home and get some rest.

01:17:54.470 --> 01:17:55.171
I'll see you tomorrow, okay?

01:17:55.304 --> 01:17:56.172
- Mom.

01:17:57.707 --> 01:18:00.009
Zane taught me a whole lot,

01:18:01.544 --> 01:18:04.413
and it really opened my eyes,

01:18:05.281 --> 01:18:10.053
but, remember, don't pass
the bible off tomorrow,

01:18:10.186 --> 01:18:11.654
until I get here.

01:18:11.788 --> 01:18:15.691
I want to be here when
it all unfolds in person.

01:18:18.694 --> 01:18:20.997
So promise me, Mom.

01:18:21.130 --> 01:18:22.531
- Honey, I promise.

01:18:22.665 --> 01:18:24.734
I don't know why you're
acting like this.

01:18:25.568 --> 01:18:27.670
Honey, it's awesome.

01:18:27.804 --> 01:18:29.672
Don't worry about
anything, Jonah.

01:18:29.806 --> 01:18:31.540
- No matter what, I'll be here.

01:18:31.674 --> 01:18:33.376
I don't want to miss it.

01:18:34.343 --> 01:18:36.813
- Stop worrying about
everything, it's okay.

01:18:38.314 --> 01:18:39.849
- We're a family.

01:18:39.983 --> 01:18:43.086
- Aw, yeah, we are.

01:18:44.687 --> 01:18:47.824
Jonah, I know a mother's not
supposed to have favorites,

01:18:47.957 --> 01:18:50.359
but you've always been mine.

01:18:50.493 --> 01:18:51.594
I love you, baby.

01:18:51.727 --> 01:18:53.863
- Love you too, Mom.
- Okay.

01:18:53.997 --> 01:18:55.731
(both laughing)

01:18:55.865 --> 01:18:57.066
See you tomorrow.

01:18:57.200 --> 01:18:59.402
Come on, let's go to sleep.
- Night.

01:18:59.535 --> 01:19:01.370
- Family.

01:19:01.504 --> 01:19:04.107
- [Jonah] Family, motherfucker.

01:19:07.777 --> 01:19:08.744
- Bring it.

01:19:09.879 --> 01:19:10.814
- I know.

01:19:10.947 --> 01:19:14.750
(ominous instrumental music)

01:19:21.224 --> 01:19:25.829
(ominous instrumental
music continues)

01:19:26.930 --> 01:19:30.633
(upbeat instrumental music)

01:19:33.937 --> 01:19:38.975
(people chattering)
(people laughing)

01:19:43.012 --> 01:19:46.782
(upbeat instrumental
music continues)

01:19:46.916 --> 01:19:49.752
(people cheering)

01:19:55.691 --> 01:20:00.196
(upbeat instrumental
music continues)

01:20:04.733 --> 01:20:09.205
(upbeat instrumental
music continues)

01:20:13.176 --> 01:20:17.713
(upbeat instrumental
music continues)

01:20:17.847 --> 01:20:19.548
- Big man.

01:20:19.682 --> 01:20:21.885
So what's this I hear about
you getting cozy with Jonah?

01:20:22.018 --> 01:20:23.386
- None of your business.

01:20:23.519 --> 01:20:25.688
- What you asking us
some shit like that for?

01:20:25.821 --> 01:20:29.292
- I don't mean no disrespect
that's just what I heard.

01:20:29.425 --> 01:20:30.526
- Wrong question.
- Man, get you're ass

01:20:30.659 --> 01:20:32.328
out of here.

01:20:33.462 --> 01:20:35.598
What you still doing
standing there?

01:20:36.499 --> 01:20:38.167
Get outta here.
- Ladies.

01:20:39.335 --> 01:20:41.204
- Can you believe
this motherfucker?

01:20:44.140 --> 01:20:46.209
- Hey can we get
on with this shit?

01:20:46.342 --> 01:20:47.310
- I told you nothing happens,

01:20:47.443 --> 01:20:49.178
until the little prick shows up.

01:20:49.312 --> 01:20:52.381
- I still want to gouge that
motherfucker's eyes out.

01:20:52.515 --> 01:20:54.817
- Yeah, well, you
may get your chance.

01:20:54.951 --> 01:20:57.020
For now, just stay calm.

01:20:57.153 --> 01:20:58.521
Ignore everybody here.

01:20:59.622 --> 01:21:00.623
I think he's bluffing.

01:21:00.756 --> 01:21:02.191
- And what if he's not?

01:21:06.362 --> 01:21:07.430
- We got it anyway.

01:21:08.531 --> 01:21:09.398
- Got what?

01:21:10.666 --> 01:21:12.035
- Chicken wings.

01:21:12.168 --> 01:21:13.269
Get ready.

01:21:16.872 --> 01:21:17.907
- It's time to eat.

01:21:19.542 --> 01:21:21.844
- Isa.
- Oh, Ken, you came.

01:21:22.645 --> 01:21:24.013
- How are you feeling?

01:21:24.147 --> 01:21:25.514
- Honestly? Better than ever.

01:21:25.648 --> 01:21:27.216
- That makes me feel so good.

01:21:27.350 --> 01:21:29.718
Listen, is there some place you,

01:21:29.852 --> 01:21:31.587
and I can talk in private?

01:21:33.322 --> 01:21:35.258
- Well, we can
talk in the house.

01:21:35.391 --> 01:21:37.426
What is it, is it about work?

01:21:37.560 --> 01:21:39.028
- It's business-related.

01:21:39.162 --> 01:21:40.496
I just have something
to talk to you about.

01:21:40.629 --> 01:21:42.098
It's really-

01:21:42.231 --> 01:21:43.599
- May I have this dance?

01:21:43.732 --> 01:21:44.533
- I don't hear any music.

01:21:44.667 --> 01:21:45.734
- Well, let's make some.

01:21:45.868 --> 01:21:47.270
(Isa laughing)

01:21:47.403 --> 01:21:48.904
- You see why I like
him, this man's nice.

01:21:49.038 --> 01:21:50.073
- So romantic.

01:21:50.206 --> 01:21:52.375
- [Isa] He is romantic.

01:21:53.509 --> 01:21:55.111
- What's up, Doc?
- Zane.

01:21:55.244 --> 01:21:56.912
- [Zane] Thanks for coming.

01:21:57.046 --> 01:21:59.915
- I wouldn't miss a
moment like this, would I?

01:22:00.049 --> 01:22:05.088
I've known you guys, well Isa,
for a very, very long time

01:22:07.290 --> 01:22:08.824
- Okay, what did
you want to say,

01:22:08.958 --> 01:22:10.326
before the man of the hour
rudely interrupted us?

01:22:10.459 --> 01:22:11.560
- Oh you're blaming me now?

01:22:11.694 --> 01:22:13.496
- I blame you for everything.

01:22:13.629 --> 01:22:15.564
Everything that happens you're
gonna be in trouble for it.

01:22:15.698 --> 01:22:16.499
(all laughing)

01:22:16.632 --> 01:22:17.666
- What did I get into?

01:22:18.901 --> 01:22:20.970
- Okay, but really,
what is it Kenny?

01:22:23.306 --> 01:22:24.807
- Yeah, I think your
mouth was moving,

01:22:24.940 --> 01:22:26.742
and something was trying
to come out but I don't

01:22:26.875 --> 01:22:28.311
know what it was.

01:22:32.615 --> 01:22:35.151
(both laughing)

01:22:35.284 --> 01:22:36.952
- I just wanted to
check in on you.

01:22:37.086 --> 01:22:38.487
Yeah, that's all.

01:22:38.621 --> 01:22:39.722
And I can see you're
perfectly back to normal.

01:22:39.855 --> 01:22:41.490
Right?
- Yes, I feel great.

01:22:41.624 --> 01:22:43.292
- Great, it's okay.

01:22:44.527 --> 01:22:45.894
I don't know why I
made such a big deal

01:22:46.029 --> 01:22:47.296
out of saying that.

01:22:47.430 --> 01:22:50.066
(all laughing)

01:22:50.199 --> 01:22:51.000
Oh, man.

01:22:51.934 --> 01:22:53.402
- I don't know what's going on.

01:22:53.536 --> 01:22:57.306
- [Kenny] Oh, I'm so glad
you're feeling better.

01:22:57.440 --> 01:22:59.242
- Oh, look who it is.

01:23:00.476 --> 01:23:02.078
- Oh, Jonah, dear.

01:23:02.211 --> 01:23:03.312
Oh, go get him, okay?

01:23:03.446 --> 01:23:04.847
- It's almost time.
- Yeah.

01:23:10.519 --> 01:23:13.222
(Zane scoffing)

01:23:13.356 --> 01:23:15.291
- I don't know why
he's acting like that.

01:23:15.424 --> 01:23:16.725
He's acting a little crazy.

01:23:16.859 --> 01:23:18.027
He must just be
nervous or something.

01:23:18.161 --> 01:23:19.828
- Must be, yeah.

01:23:19.962 --> 01:23:20.829
- Excuse me.

01:23:24.600 --> 01:23:25.468
- I bet.

01:23:27.470 --> 01:23:32.475
- Jonah, there he
is, glad you made it.

01:23:35.344 --> 01:23:37.913
- I've got nothing
to say to you.

01:23:38.047 --> 01:23:39.648
- Fair enough.

01:23:39.782 --> 01:23:42.985
Whatever it is you're
thinking about doing, don't.

01:23:44.520 --> 01:23:47.690
It's not worth it, son.

01:23:52.295 --> 01:23:55.964
Whatever you think you
know, you don't know shit.

01:23:57.966 --> 01:24:00.035
It's a mistake.

01:24:00.169 --> 01:24:02.371
You know what we
do with mistakes?

01:24:02.505 --> 01:24:04.640
We make mistakes,
and we move on.

01:24:05.974 --> 01:24:09.044
(laughs) Look at your mother.

01:24:10.513 --> 01:24:14.883
She's happy, I'm
happy, end of story.

01:24:19.388 --> 01:24:21.890
- You can't take back
what you've already done.

01:24:29.265 --> 01:24:32.535
- Hey, baby, where
you been, huh?

01:24:32.668 --> 01:24:35.438
- Do you think I'm stupid?
- What?

01:24:35.571 --> 01:24:37.706
- You were in on
it the whole time.

01:24:39.575 --> 01:24:41.844
- I don't know what
you're talking about.

01:24:42.878 --> 01:24:45.281
- And you weren't even
that good of a fuck.

01:24:47.049 --> 01:24:49.585
Stay the hell away
from me and my family.

01:24:50.886 --> 01:24:53.922
(people chattering)

01:24:59.395 --> 01:25:00.796
(people continue chattering)

01:25:00.929 --> 01:25:02.798
- Everybody gather.

01:25:02.931 --> 01:25:05.033
I know this was
very short notice

01:25:05.168 --> 01:25:07.102
so a lot of people
couldn't make it.

01:25:07.236 --> 01:25:08.204
Thank you to those
who showed up.

01:25:08.337 --> 01:25:10.606
It shows a lot of respect.

01:25:10.739 --> 01:25:12.408
Now if only you
could have showed

01:25:12.541 --> 01:25:13.842
up to your jobs on time when
I was actually doing this.

01:25:13.976 --> 01:25:17.246
(everyone laughing)

01:25:17.380 --> 01:25:20.783
About a month ago, I
came to the realization

01:25:20.916 --> 01:25:22.818
it was time to pass the torch,

01:25:24.119 --> 01:25:27.022
and I can't think of anyone
more deserving than Zane.

01:25:28.123 --> 01:25:30.125
He walked into my life
a couple years ago,

01:25:30.259 --> 01:25:32.361
and proved to me that not
all men deserve a bullet

01:25:32.495 --> 01:25:34.463
between the eyes.
(everyone laughing)

01:25:34.597 --> 01:25:35.964
Come up here, baby.

01:25:40.236 --> 01:25:42.838
I'm not just giving
you my contacts today.

01:25:43.772 --> 01:25:47.075
I'm giving you my
trust and my blessings,

01:25:48.911 --> 01:25:50.679
because I love you.

01:25:50.813 --> 01:25:51.947
- I love you.

01:25:55.218 --> 01:25:56.185
- [Crowd] Aw.

01:25:56.319 --> 01:25:59.121
(crowd cheering)

01:26:01.457 --> 01:26:03.326
- [Zane] What the fuck is that?

01:26:03.459 --> 01:26:05.027
- That's what got you sick, Mom.

01:26:06.094 --> 01:26:07.796
Only it was meant to kill you,

01:26:07.930 --> 01:26:10.533
and the guy right next to
you is the one who did it.

01:26:12.901 --> 01:26:15.904
- See this is why
bars card minors.

01:26:16.038 --> 01:26:18.374
Maybe you should lay
off the adult beverages.

01:26:18.507 --> 01:26:20.543
Mickey, Franklin, why
don't you take Jonah

01:26:20.676 --> 01:26:21.844
out front and give
him some fresh air?

01:26:21.977 --> 01:26:23.879
- Don't you touch my son.

01:26:24.012 --> 01:26:27.816
(intense instrumental music)

01:26:33.489 --> 01:26:34.523
- Is this true?

01:26:35.658 --> 01:26:36.525
- No.

01:26:37.660 --> 01:26:38.894
Come on, they're
on fucking drugs.

01:26:39.027 --> 01:26:41.029
They're out of
their fucking minds.

01:26:42.531 --> 01:26:45.000
- You know, I knew you'd
say something like that.

01:26:45.133 --> 01:26:46.902
So don't even take
my word for it.

01:26:47.035 --> 01:26:48.003
Ask Kenny.

01:26:49.037 --> 01:26:50.373
Kenny, was that the
drug that was used

01:26:50.506 --> 01:26:52.241
to try to take out my mom?

01:26:58.046 --> 01:26:58.914
- It was.

01:27:01.317 --> 01:27:02.751
- Come on, you gonna believe

01:27:02.885 --> 01:27:05.354
some fucking pill-popping
doctor feel-good, huh?

01:27:06.555 --> 01:27:07.256
They're framing me!

01:27:07.390 --> 01:27:08.324
They're jealous.

01:27:08.457 --> 01:27:10.058
This is envy.

01:27:10.192 --> 01:27:13.028
- All you ever wanted, was
to take over the business.

01:27:13.161 --> 01:27:14.763
That was your plan
the whole time.

01:27:14.897 --> 01:27:17.400
You tried to flip the
switch, and it almost worked.

01:27:18.934 --> 01:27:20.569
And then you tried to use me.

01:27:22.170 --> 01:27:23.872
You even had your
own sister fuck me

01:27:24.006 --> 01:27:26.542
to try to get me to endorse you.

01:27:26.675 --> 01:27:30.045
It was a good fucking
try, I'll give you that.

01:27:30.178 --> 01:27:34.383
But you're not family, and
you never fucking will be.

01:27:38.354 --> 01:27:41.123
I'll let my mom decide what
she's gonna do with you now,

01:27:42.124 --> 01:27:44.126
but you're not getting
shit she's built.

01:27:46.128 --> 01:27:47.062
You're finished.

01:27:48.263 --> 01:27:50.533
- Honey, listen to
me, this isn't true.

01:27:50.666 --> 01:27:53.101
I would never do this,
you gotta believe me.

01:27:53.235 --> 01:27:55.037
Please, you're my wife.

01:27:55.170 --> 01:27:56.639
I would never do this.

01:27:56.772 --> 01:28:00.208
- I'm not your fucking
wife, you bastard!

01:28:00.343 --> 01:28:03.045
Get the fuck out of my house!

01:28:05.848 --> 01:28:08.884
- You're fucking
crazy, all of you!

01:28:09.017 --> 01:28:11.454
You don't even know
what you're losing.

01:28:15.791 --> 01:28:17.593
- Get the fuck out of here.

01:28:18.927 --> 01:28:22.431
- When I said to
drop it, I meant it.

01:28:24.733 --> 01:28:26.134
Kill 'em all!
- Fuck.

01:28:26.268 --> 01:28:31.306
(people screaming)
(guns firing)

01:28:33.642 --> 01:28:38.614

(intense instrumental music)

01:28:58.634 --> 01:29:01.937
- Please get up,
please get up, please!

01:29:08.143 --> 01:29:12.781
(intense instrumental
music continues)

01:29:15.918 --> 01:29:18.220
- Mom!
(guns firing)

01:29:18.353 --> 01:29:19.354
- No!

01:29:19.488 --> 01:29:20.789
Die, bitch.

01:29:20.923 --> 01:29:23.358
(gun firing)

01:29:26.529 --> 01:29:28.697
Oh, God, Jonah.

01:29:28.831 --> 01:29:30.866
(intense instrumental music)

01:29:30.999 --> 01:29:33.035
- [Zane] Motherfuckers.

01:29:33.168 --> 01:29:38.206
(guns firing)
(Zane groaning)

01:29:40.576 --> 01:29:44.179

(Caine screaming)

01:29:44.312 --> 01:29:49.284

01:30:02.798 --> 01:30:03.666
- Okay.

01:30:05.801 --> 01:30:07.335
It's gonna be okay.

01:30:07.470 --> 01:30:08.937
Can you hear me?

01:30:09.071 --> 01:30:10.338
Jonah?

01:30:10.473 --> 01:30:12.240
Just hold on a little bit.

01:30:12.374 --> 01:30:14.109
Oh, Jonah, please hold on.

01:30:17.646 --> 01:30:20.348
Oh, God, no!

01:30:22.685 --> 01:30:24.487
My baby.

01:30:25.688 --> 01:30:30.659
My little baby.

01:30:30.793 --> 01:30:33.829
Oh, my baby.

01:30:35.030 --> 01:30:37.500
Oh, God, no.

01:30:39.902 --> 01:30:43.672

(intense instrumental music)

01:31:14.136 --> 01:31:15.237
- Any last words?

01:31:16.204 --> 01:31:17.305
- Nice tux.

01:31:19.041 --> 01:31:20.008
- Save it.

01:31:22.645 --> 01:31:23.779
It's a rental.

01:31:29.351 --> 01:31:31.153
- Don't do it.

01:31:31.286 --> 01:31:35.490
- Isa, help me.

01:31:36.525 --> 01:31:37.993
- I don't think so.

01:31:38.126 --> 01:31:40.328
- I wasn't trying to kill you.

01:31:40.462 --> 01:31:41.864
- What did you want?

01:31:41.997 --> 01:31:47.836
- I just wanted you to need me.

01:31:47.970 --> 01:31:49.471
- Oh fuck off.

01:31:49.605 --> 01:31:51.373
Rot in hell, baby.

01:31:52.841 --> 01:31:54.977
- No.

(soft instrumental

01:33:08.383 --> 01:33:12.755
So many times you weren't
there when I needed you.

But you're here when
I needed you the most.

01:33:17.392 --> 01:33:18.260
