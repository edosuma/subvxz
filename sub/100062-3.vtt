WEBVTT

00:02.524 --> 00:04.613
And then I moved to Ohio --

00:04.656 --> 00:06.310
Akron, Ohio,
rubber capital of the world.

00:06.354 --> 00:08.834
He's at the 20-minute mark.
Louis, make it stop.

00:08.878 --> 00:10.488
Never. I'm riveted.
What a life.

00:10.532 --> 00:12.621
Marvin:
And it was there that I adopted

00:12.664 --> 00:15.841
a little pet alligator
I nicknamed Rocky.

00:17.321 --> 00:18.931
His given name was Rico.

00:18.975 --> 00:20.498
Rocky, baby!Rocky.

00:20.542 --> 00:22.283
All teeth and all love.

00:23.501 --> 00:26.069
That's my best Navy buddy,
Clyde Roses.

00:26.113 --> 00:27.244
He followed me
out to the Rust Belt.

00:27.288 --> 00:30.291
We worked the line
at the GM plant together.

00:30.334 --> 00:31.857
And if anybody
needs auto parts,

00:31.901 --> 00:33.207
I have a scrapyard
in Pine Hills.

00:34.251 --> 00:36.297
You got a spoiler
for a station wagon?

00:36.340 --> 00:38.429
Spoiler alert --
I do.

00:38.473 --> 00:40.692
Now, uh,
before we call it a night,

00:40.736 --> 00:42.433
there is
one more thing --

00:42.477 --> 00:44.435
your retirement present.Ohh.

00:45.741 --> 00:48.657
You're getting me my very ownflagpole for the yard?

00:48.700 --> 00:50.311
Oh, honey,it's the perfect gift.

00:50.354 --> 00:51.486
Thank you, thank you.

00:53.923 --> 00:55.881
Grandma: Wait.

00:55.925 --> 00:58.232
I have an announcement.

00:58.275 --> 01:00.712
Grandma, if you fart right now,
it'd be the perfect joke.

01:10.940 --> 01:13.160
Retire from what?

01:13.203 --> 01:15.249
--Captions by VITAC--

01:15.292 --> 01:16.467
♪ Fresh off the boat

01:16.511 --> 01:18.252
♪ I'm gettin' mine
everywhere I go ♪

01:18.295 --> 01:20.558
♪ If you don't know, homey,
now you know ♪

01:20.602 --> 01:21.951
♪ Fresh off the boat

01:21.994 --> 01:24.388
♪ Homey, you don't know
where I come from ♪

01:24.432 --> 01:25.476
♪ But I know where I'm goin'

01:25.520 --> 01:28.349
♪ I'm fresh off the boat

01:30.786 --> 01:32.179
I'm just
gonna say it.

01:32.222 --> 01:34.311
Does anyone know
what Grandma's retiring from?

01:34.355 --> 01:35.312
No idea.

01:35.356 --> 01:37.184
I am so happy
you brought that up.

01:37.227 --> 01:39.751
I was standing there last nightthinking, "What on Earth?"

01:41.188 --> 01:43.973
I have made a list of
my preferred retirement gifts.

01:45.192 --> 01:46.932
Any one will do.

01:46.976 --> 01:48.151
Just a gift?
No party?

01:48.195 --> 01:51.372
The answers you seek
are on the list.

01:53.591 --> 01:55.593
Drum kit? Hot tub?

01:55.637 --> 01:57.769
Trip to Jamaica for one?

01:57.813 --> 01:58.988
She wouldn't
like Jamaica.

01:59.031 --> 02:00.729
The post-colonial povertywould bum her out.

02:00.772 --> 02:02.296
Kid gets
one Bob Marley CD.

02:03.340 --> 02:04.994
This list is crazy.

02:05.995 --> 02:08.040
Because she expects me
to dismiss it.

02:08.084 --> 02:10.826
She wants a retirement party,
but she's too proud to ask.

02:10.869 --> 02:12.958
Or she's just using
that retirement

02:13.002 --> 02:14.525
as an excuse
to get a gift.

02:14.569 --> 02:16.179
Well, can I afford
to take the chance?

02:16.223 --> 02:18.268
I don't give her this party,
and then she'll seek revenge,

02:18.312 --> 02:19.748
and I just don't have
the time for that.

02:19.791 --> 02:20.966
Totally get it.

02:21.010 --> 02:22.751
It's a lotta work,
but I'm happy to do it.

02:22.794 --> 02:24.405
She deserves
to be celebrated.

02:26.102 --> 02:28.060
Can someone
agree with me?

02:28.104 --> 02:29.540
Sure.Yep.What a woman.
No.

02:35.242 --> 02:38.462
I know I seemed to be
my usual fun self at breakfast,

02:38.506 --> 02:40.856
but underneath that mirth,
I'm full of fear.

02:40.899 --> 02:42.336
Why?We have a problem.

02:42.379 --> 02:44.251
At Marvin's party
last night,

02:44.294 --> 02:46.470
I overheard him gossiping
about his patients.

02:46.514 --> 02:47.384
About a month ago,

02:47.428 --> 02:49.560
I was at his office
for a dental procedure.

02:53.260 --> 02:54.826
What's so funny?

02:54.870 --> 02:56.306
Oh, nothing.

02:56.350 --> 02:58.439
You just told us a funny secretwhile you were under the gas.

02:58.482 --> 03:01.268
Don't worry.
I won't tell anybody.

03:01.311 --> 03:03.618
Dentist-Patient
confidentiality.

03:07.056 --> 03:08.100
Marvin retiring means

03:08.144 --> 03:10.451
that the Dentist-Patient
confidentiality is over.

03:10.494 --> 03:13.062
That's why he's blabbing
about his ex-patients.

03:13.105 --> 03:15.586
He can freely tell my secret
with no consequences.

03:15.630 --> 03:16.674
But, Evan, it's you.

03:16.718 --> 03:19.242
If you have any secrets,they're baby secrets.

03:19.286 --> 03:20.896
Like you befriended
a ladybug

03:20.939 --> 03:23.072
and thenaccidentally stepped on it.

03:23.115 --> 03:25.248
R.I.P., Spottypants.

03:25.292 --> 03:27.511
But I do have
a big boy secret.

03:27.555 --> 03:29.078
And it could hurt us all.

03:29.121 --> 03:30.384
Marvin operated
on my teeth

03:30.427 --> 03:33.169
the day after
the best day of our lives.

03:34.344 --> 03:35.302
No.
Yep.

03:35.345 --> 03:38.043
I might've told him
about "Reggie."

03:39.175 --> 03:41.090
Reggie?Reggie.

03:44.354 --> 03:46.487
Congrats, Jenny!

03:46.530 --> 03:50.360
It's amazing, you put in
all those years, doing...

03:50.404 --> 03:51.840
what you did.

03:51.883 --> 03:53.276
No longer, though.

03:53.320 --> 03:56.888
Yeah -- Yeah, you did
a great job at that -- the job.

03:59.108 --> 04:00.283
Okay.
Okay.

04:00.327 --> 04:01.676
Hey, Carol-Joan,

04:01.719 --> 04:03.286
those lip injections
are looking good.

04:04.331 --> 04:06.724
I only did it
to be a better whistler.

04:08.204 --> 04:11.294
You were right.
He's a blabber box.

04:11.338 --> 04:12.556
Uh, hello.

04:12.600 --> 04:14.341
I want to thank you all

04:14.384 --> 04:16.343
for joining us to celebrate
my mother's retirement.

04:17.561 --> 04:20.172
Now, if you could all turn
your attention to the screen,

04:20.216 --> 04:22.131
I put together
a little retrospective.

04:26.353 --> 04:28.703
♪ You're simply the best

04:31.358 --> 04:34.491
♪ Better than all the rest

04:35.971 --> 04:39.888
♪ Better than anyone

04:39.931 --> 04:42.151
♪ Anyone I ever met

04:42.194 --> 04:44.893
♪ You're simply the best

04:47.461 --> 04:49.767
I had to imagine myself
while I was singing that

04:49.811 --> 04:51.334
for it to feel real.

04:51.378 --> 04:55.338
Uh, Ma,you simply are the best.

04:55.382 --> 04:58.385
Uh, and now thatyou're retiring from, uh...

04:59.473 --> 05:00.561
Uh...

05:00.604 --> 05:01.997
y-you'll have time

05:02.040 --> 05:05.000
to, uh, make new memorieswith all of us.

05:07.785 --> 05:10.005
Um, now, is there anythingyou'd like to say to everyone?

05:10.048 --> 05:12.486
I love you all.

05:12.529 --> 05:15.402
Now I'm ready for my gift.

05:17.621 --> 05:19.580
Oh. Uh, well...

05:19.623 --> 05:21.364
Uh...

05:21.408 --> 05:22.931
The partyis kind of the gift.

05:22.974 --> 05:24.585
Oh.

05:24.628 --> 05:27.414
Then it was not necessary.

05:27.457 --> 05:29.372
You should have just
bought me a hot tub.

05:29.416 --> 05:30.591
Um...

05:30.634 --> 05:33.158
I'm sorry this nice partyisn't enough for you,

05:33.202 --> 05:35.030
but a hot tubis just impractical.

05:35.073 --> 05:36.597
It's a big responsibility.

05:36.640 --> 05:39.382
Who'd wash it?Who'd pay for its utility bills?

05:39.426 --> 05:41.950
Who'd, uh, take care of itwhen we're out of town?

05:41.993 --> 05:44.256
Uh, maybe we start you
with a foot bath.

05:44.300 --> 05:46.955
Maybe you start me
with a hot tub.

05:48.652 --> 05:50.828
Trent, the room is dying.
Give me "Rolling on the River."

05:50.872 --> 05:52.439
It's called "Proud Mary."

05:52.482 --> 05:54.441
And it's in D major,so good luck.

05:58.836 --> 06:01.491
I still can't believe
you told Marvin about Reggie.

06:01.535 --> 06:02.753
Hey, lay off!

06:02.797 --> 06:05.060
I didn't even wantanything to do with "Reggie."

06:05.103 --> 06:06.844
It was your guys' idea,and you pressured me to go.

06:06.888 --> 06:08.063
Really?

06:08.106 --> 06:10.282
So, you didn't want
to cut piano class,

06:10.326 --> 06:12.981
drive across state lines
to meet Reginald VelJohnson,

06:13.024 --> 06:14.417
AKA Carl Winslow,

06:14.461 --> 06:16.593
read his memoir at
the Georgia Tech Student Union?

06:16.637 --> 06:18.203
Please!

06:18.247 --> 06:21.511
Guys, it doesn't matter who's
to blame. We're all guilty.

06:21.555 --> 06:24.514
Well, Evan ratted on us,
so he should take the heat

06:24.558 --> 06:26.821
and tell Mom and Dad
he did it by himself.

06:26.864 --> 06:28.518
Whoa, whoa!
That's crazy!

06:28.562 --> 06:30.607
We don't even knowif I told him anything.

06:30.651 --> 06:33.480
Why don't we just ask Marvin
if he knows?

06:33.523 --> 06:35.438
Dummy,
if he didn't know,

06:35.482 --> 06:37.353
we'd be telling him our secretby asking.

06:38.441 --> 06:40.661
Public schoolsare failing our children.

06:40.704 --> 06:42.576
The only way to make sure
Marvin stays quiet

06:42.619 --> 06:45.100
is to find out a secret
about himto use against him.

06:45.143 --> 06:47.668
Shut those loose lips
with leverage.

06:47.711 --> 06:49.234
If anyone knows a secret
about Marvin,

06:49.278 --> 06:51.019
it's got to be
his old Navy buddy.

06:53.891 --> 06:56.111
This is a punch cardfor Chubby Burger.

06:56.154 --> 06:57.242
Oh, whoops.

06:57.286 --> 06:59.288
I'm so close to a free egg.

07:01.856 --> 07:04.249
This cuff link!Why won't it come out?!

07:04.293 --> 07:06.600
Louis, you know you shouldn't
undress when you're upset.

07:06.643 --> 07:08.253
Remember when
you tore your pants

07:08.297 --> 07:10.299
after watching
"Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo"?

07:10.342 --> 07:11.909
Why is Schneider
wasting our time?

07:11.953 --> 07:14.695
Just make the movie versionof the "Makin' Copies" guy!

07:15.739 --> 07:16.871
I just can't believemy mom tonight.

07:16.914 --> 07:18.829
Louis, so she didn't like
your party.

07:18.873 --> 07:20.309
Why are you so upset?

07:20.352 --> 07:22.703
It's not just tonight.She does this all the time.

07:22.746 --> 07:25.140
I do everything for her,but do I ever get a thank-you?

07:25.183 --> 07:26.489
One thank-you?

07:26.533 --> 07:28.360
How can she be
so ungrateful?

07:28.404 --> 07:29.840
It's frustrating.
I know.

07:29.884 --> 07:32.277
Mother-son relationships
are complicated.

07:32.321 --> 07:34.062
Remember last week
with Evan?

07:34.105 --> 07:37.500
I justbought this soy milk,
and you leave it out to spoil?

07:37.544 --> 07:38.632
I'm sorry, Mommy.

07:39.981 --> 07:41.635
I know
we have car insurance,

07:41.678 --> 07:45.116
but do we have
mailbox and tree insurance?

07:46.117 --> 07:48.293
It's all about
perspective.

07:48.337 --> 07:50.600
Compared to perfection,
Evan messed up.

07:50.644 --> 07:52.515
Compared to Eddie,
Evan is a saint.

07:52.559 --> 07:54.735
Wait. That's it.

07:54.778 --> 07:56.911
My mom has her own Eddie.

07:58.913 --> 08:00.741
Gene!

08:00.784 --> 08:02.743
I'll invite my jackass brotherover to visit,

08:02.786 --> 08:03.918
and he'll annoy Mom
so much,

08:03.961 --> 08:05.528
she'll see how good she has itwith me!

08:05.572 --> 08:06.747
No, Louis!

08:06.790 --> 08:07.748
His voice is too loud

08:07.791 --> 08:09.663
and his clothes
are too colorful.

08:09.706 --> 08:11.752
And his cologne.
He's tough on all the senses.

08:11.795 --> 08:13.971
Exactly. I'll tellhim Mom's retiring,and he'll rush out here.

08:14.015 --> 08:15.756
Oh, God.

08:15.799 --> 08:18.323
Hurricane Geneis coming to Orlando.

08:23.024 --> 08:24.808
Hello, brother.

08:28.986 --> 08:31.772
Your face is like
a sunrise in my heart.

08:41.738 --> 08:44.654
Each leaf in this tea
has a story.

08:46.830 --> 08:49.659
Gene, you seem
a little different.

08:49.703 --> 08:51.574
Not just seem.

08:51.618 --> 08:53.402
I am.

08:53.445 --> 08:55.404
You see, I had
a near-death experience.

08:55.447 --> 08:57.449
Oh, no!
What happened?

08:57.493 --> 08:59.451
I was at
the Singapore zoo.

08:59.495 --> 09:03.368
I climbed on the railings
to make faces at the lions.

09:03.412 --> 09:04.674
Then I fell in the pit.

09:04.718 --> 09:06.371
What?!

09:06.415 --> 09:08.460
As that lioness
was clawing my chest,

09:08.504 --> 09:10.680
I realized
life is precious

09:10.724 --> 09:12.813
and we must value
every moment

09:12.856 --> 09:14.249
while we have
on this Earth.

09:14.292 --> 09:15.946
He's not a hurricane.

09:15.990 --> 09:18.035
He's a warm breeze
on a hot summer day.

09:18.079 --> 09:19.602
This is great.

09:19.646 --> 09:21.822
This new Geneis more annoying than ever.

09:21.865 --> 09:24.868
So, Gene, you came here
for my retirement.

09:24.912 --> 09:26.217
Did you bring me a gift?

09:26.261 --> 09:27.218
I did, Mother.

09:28.437 --> 09:30.613
I brought youa deep hug of gratitude.

09:30.657 --> 09:33.268
O-O-Oh, no -- no --
no, thank you.

09:33.311 --> 09:36.445
Does anybody know
how to give a gift anymore?

09:39.274 --> 09:40.754
What's wrong
with our mother?

09:40.797 --> 09:42.451
Well, you may not
realize this,

09:42.494 --> 09:44.409
because you visit
once every 10 years,

09:44.453 --> 09:46.455
but our aging mother
can be difficult.

09:46.498 --> 09:48.196
Jessica: She's been like thisall the time,

09:48.239 --> 09:50.633
and it's been "Steady Louis"taking care of everything

09:50.677 --> 09:51.808
while you've been
in Taiwan.

09:51.852 --> 09:53.636
You're right.
I haven't been here.

09:53.680 --> 09:56.900
But now it's my turn
to share the load with Mom.

09:56.944 --> 09:58.685
Suddenly you care
about doing your share?

09:58.728 --> 09:59.990
I do.

10:00.034 --> 10:01.818
Okay, sure.

10:01.862 --> 10:05.039
Uh, well, Mom has
a full plate of errands today

10:05.082 --> 10:06.518
that I'd help her with,

10:06.562 --> 10:08.999
but, um, why don't you go ahead
and take over for me?

10:09.043 --> 10:11.654
Oh, I'd love to.
It'd be great fun.

10:11.698 --> 10:13.656
Right. That's our mom --
a pleasure.

10:18.052 --> 10:19.531
You.

10:19.575 --> 10:22.317
Just...you.

10:24.362 --> 10:25.886
Eddie: So, Clyde,
we're here because

10:25.929 --> 10:28.453
we were thinking of doinga retirement roast for Marvin.

10:28.497 --> 10:29.890
Ohh!

10:29.933 --> 10:32.022
We need some funny stories
of him when he was younger.

10:33.328 --> 10:35.547
Well, funny stories and Ol' Marvgo hand in hand,

10:35.591 --> 10:37.811
like, uh --
like plums and hot sauce.

10:37.854 --> 10:41.075
In '68, Marv and I
were driving across country,

10:41.118 --> 10:44.469
took a stop in New Orleans,
met some swamp ladies.

10:44.513 --> 10:46.646
Well, we had
a few drinks and --

10:47.908 --> 10:49.823
I can't finish
this story.

10:51.346 --> 10:54.741
Okay, how about a story
from when you were in the Navy?

10:54.784 --> 10:56.481
Once, we stopped
this mysterious boat

10:56.525 --> 10:58.309
that had crossed
into American waters.

10:58.353 --> 11:00.747
Marv and I kicked down
the doors to the bridge,

11:00.790 --> 11:04.315
and we were confronted
by these -- these two...

11:04.359 --> 11:05.795
sea ladies.

11:05.839 --> 11:07.928
So, we had
a few drinks and --

11:10.321 --> 11:11.714
I can't finish
this story, either.

11:11.758 --> 11:13.498
Well, are there any stories
you can tell us

11:13.542 --> 11:14.674
without drinks or ladies?

11:16.414 --> 11:17.502
Here it is, boys.

11:17.546 --> 11:19.069
Marvin?

11:19.113 --> 11:21.942
Marvin is my best buddy.
We're like brothers.

11:21.985 --> 11:24.945
And brothers don't
talk out of school
about their secrets.

11:24.988 --> 11:26.381
I'm sorry
I can't be more helpful.

11:26.424 --> 11:28.731
I got to go, uh,
fire up the magnet.

11:30.820 --> 11:31.995
Move some cars.

11:32.039 --> 11:34.302
Come on.

11:34.345 --> 11:35.738
Yeah, come on.

11:37.914 --> 11:40.743
Gene and Mom have been
doing errands for a long time.

11:40.787 --> 11:41.744
That's a goodthing.

11:41.788 --> 11:43.746
They probably got in a fightat the salon

11:43.790 --> 11:44.747
and one of them
is arrested.

11:44.791 --> 11:45.879
Or dead.

11:47.881 --> 11:48.838
Damn it.

11:48.882 --> 11:49.752
Gene: Hey!

11:49.796 --> 11:52.015
Sorry to
take so long.

11:52.059 --> 11:53.887
Her nail guy
is very chatty,

11:53.930 --> 11:56.803
and I loved
every minute of it.

11:56.846 --> 11:57.934
I believe in him.

11:57.978 --> 12:00.545
I think he hasdesigned
a better energy drink.

12:00.589 --> 12:02.634
The trick is
getting it into stores.

12:02.678 --> 12:04.854
Anyway, Ma,
I'm gonna get you some water.

12:13.210 --> 12:14.168
You don't?

12:14.211 --> 12:15.735
That's never
crossed my mind at all.

12:23.830 --> 12:26.354
Uh, that means
so much, Ma.

12:26.397 --> 12:27.442
Thanks.

12:30.097 --> 12:31.359
Wow.

12:31.402 --> 12:34.144
This new, extra-annoying Genetotally did the trick.

12:34.188 --> 12:36.190
She's nevertreated you like that.

12:36.233 --> 12:37.234
I know.

12:37.278 --> 12:38.932
I'm pretty emotional
on the inside right now,

12:38.975 --> 12:40.585
but I don't want to cry
in front of you.

12:40.629 --> 12:42.979
Don't. Bottle it upand save it for the shower.

12:44.024 --> 12:45.982
Wasn't that
amazing?

12:46.026 --> 12:47.636
Um, what are you
talking about?

12:47.679 --> 12:48.855
When I arrived,

12:48.898 --> 12:51.814
I sensed there was tension
between you and Mom.

12:51.858 --> 12:53.816
You glowed
with resentment.

12:53.860 --> 12:55.383
So I talked to her
about it,

12:55.426 --> 12:57.951
and I got her to empathize
with the burden you feel.

12:57.994 --> 13:00.605
You're saying
you somehow got our mother

13:00.649 --> 13:01.955
to feel empathy for me?

13:01.998 --> 13:04.871
The woman who thinks Lex Luthoris the hero of "Superman"?

13:04.914 --> 13:05.959
I did.

13:06.002 --> 13:08.483
Well, I don't know
what to say.

13:08.526 --> 13:10.006
I appreciate
you doing that.

13:10.050 --> 13:12.835
Look, I couldn't have
fallen in that lion pit
and changed my life

13:12.879 --> 13:14.663
if you weren't here
taking care of Mom,

13:14.706 --> 13:16.708
so it was --
it was the least I could do.

13:18.101 --> 13:19.494
Thanks, Gene.

13:20.887 --> 13:22.976
Whoo! She's firing up
the jets!

13:24.020 --> 13:25.761
Jets?

13:26.893 --> 13:28.242
Isn't she beautiful?

13:28.285 --> 13:30.287
Same-day delivery.

13:30.331 --> 13:32.072
You bought her
a hot tub?

13:32.115 --> 13:33.856
I taught her
to value you more,

13:33.900 --> 13:36.685
and as a reward
for learning her lesson,

13:36.728 --> 13:38.078
I got her a gift.

13:38.121 --> 13:39.993
So you didn't
teach her anything.

13:40.036 --> 13:42.125
You just bought her off!

13:45.476 --> 13:48.305
Oh, yes, I rememberthe day you came in well.

13:48.349 --> 13:50.090
You werea real Chatty Cathy.

13:50.133 --> 13:51.004
Nice job, bro.

13:51.047 --> 13:52.744
What did I say,
exactly?

13:52.788 --> 13:55.312
Well, it wasn't so much whatyou said.

13:55.356 --> 13:56.313
It's how you said it.

13:56.357 --> 13:58.011
Little secret.

13:58.054 --> 14:01.710
Your eyebrows
look like birds.

14:03.146 --> 14:05.670
So I wasn't
making any sense?

14:05.714 --> 14:07.672
No, you just kept lookingat your reflection

14:07.716 --> 14:10.240
in my tiny mirror and saying,"Peep these cheeks!"

14:10.284 --> 14:11.459
That's amazing!

14:11.502 --> 14:13.765
Oh, and youwerethe opposite of Evan

14:13.809 --> 14:15.115
when you were there.

14:15.158 --> 14:16.246
Come again, Queenie?

14:16.290 --> 14:20.729
This is a secret,
but I love Garth Brooks.

14:20.772 --> 14:24.124
And Shania impresses me
very much.

14:24.167 --> 14:26.126
Oh, and me and my brothers
drove to Georgia

14:26.169 --> 14:28.911
to meet
Reginald VelJohnson.

14:28.955 --> 14:31.131
It wasn't my fault!
It was the gas!

14:31.174 --> 14:32.523
They gave me
a man's dosage

14:32.567 --> 14:33.916
even though
I'm still a little boy!

14:33.960 --> 14:37.006
Is Georgia beautiful?I hear it's beautiful.

14:43.186 --> 14:45.058
I feel like we're in
a giant bowl of noodles.

14:45.101 --> 14:47.147
You ever wonder
what it would be like

14:47.190 --> 14:49.714
if we spent our life
as a noodle?

14:49.758 --> 14:51.151
That's enough, Gene.

14:51.194 --> 14:53.936
Okay, everybody out! This tub isgoing back where it came from!

14:53.980 --> 14:56.069
Whoa, boss.You said this is a job for
two?

14:56.112 --> 14:57.070
I dunno.

14:57.113 --> 14:59.072
We're gonna
drain it first.

14:59.115 --> 15:01.074
Jessica,
what are you doing?

15:01.117 --> 15:02.336
Your mother said

15:02.379 --> 15:04.512
she'd take care of the tub
and pay the utilities,

15:04.555 --> 15:06.514
so why say no
to a free hot tub?

15:06.557 --> 15:07.776
And you believe her?

15:07.819 --> 15:08.995
Gene: Don't worry.

15:09.038 --> 15:10.735
If Mom
can't make payments,

15:10.779 --> 15:12.999
then Steady Gene
can handle it.

15:13.042 --> 15:14.957
Steady Gene?

15:15.001 --> 15:16.045
Hilarious.

15:16.089 --> 15:17.568
Here's what's actuallygonna happen.

15:17.612 --> 15:20.093
In about a week or two, Mom willforget to pay the utilities,

15:20.136 --> 15:21.355
Gene will be long gone,

15:21.398 --> 15:23.531
and it'll all fall on me,just like it always does.

15:23.574 --> 15:25.750
You have
that little faith in me?

15:25.794 --> 15:28.405
The one thing I have faith inis that you'll always screw up.

15:28.449 --> 15:31.104
I even brought you here toscrew up and make me look good,

15:31.147 --> 15:32.844
and you somehowscrewed that up, too.

15:32.888 --> 15:34.977
I'm not a screw-up
anymore.

15:35.021 --> 15:36.544
I've changed.

15:36.587 --> 15:38.241
But clearly, youhaven't.

15:38.285 --> 15:40.200
Once a martyr,
always a martyr.

15:42.811 --> 15:45.379
I'm not ready to show
my lion scars to anyone.

15:45.422 --> 15:50.427
But my emotionalscars
for being your brother?

15:50.471 --> 15:54.083
Well, that is right out there
for all to witness!

15:57.826 --> 15:59.001
Not to invite myself in,

15:59.045 --> 16:01.177
but have you ever seena redhead in a hot tub?

16:01.221 --> 16:03.005
It's like
a lobster in a pot.

16:03.049 --> 16:04.876
It's sort of
my party trick.

16:09.272 --> 16:11.057
Gene's locked himself
in our bedroom.

16:11.100 --> 16:13.233
He says he's meditating,
but I can hear him crying.

16:13.276 --> 16:14.886
Why can't anything
be easy?

16:14.930 --> 16:16.453
Can you believe this?

16:16.497 --> 16:18.890
Gene was right.
You're a martyr.

16:18.934 --> 16:20.153
What are you
talking about?

16:20.196 --> 16:21.893
You goteverything you wanted.

16:21.937 --> 16:23.460
A helpful Gene,a respectful Grandma,

16:23.504 --> 16:24.809
even a new hot tub.

16:24.853 --> 16:27.247
Yet you're still acting likeit's some kind of a burden.

16:27.290 --> 16:30.076
"I'm Louis.
Woe is me. Poor me.

16:30.119 --> 16:32.165
I marriedtotally out of my league."

16:32.208 --> 16:35.081
I guess I got so used to
fixing my family's problems

16:35.124 --> 16:37.126
that I didn't believe
that they could change.

16:37.170 --> 16:39.041
Well, of course not.You're terrible with change.

16:39.085 --> 16:40.608
What do you mean?

16:40.651 --> 16:43.393
When Emery tried to quitvolleyball, you stalked him.

16:43.437 --> 16:46.266
When Eddie had to learn howto drive, you pushed him so hard

16:46.309 --> 16:47.832
that he ran overa child on a scooter.

16:47.876 --> 16:50.270
When Gene arrived and your rolewith Grandma changed,

16:50.313 --> 16:51.271
here we are.

16:51.314 --> 16:52.272
I could go on.

16:52.315 --> 16:53.447
No, no, I get it.

16:53.490 --> 16:54.883
It's hard for me.

16:54.926 --> 16:58.887
You see Marvin's stupidnew flagpole in his yard?

16:58.930 --> 17:00.280
That's you.

17:00.323 --> 17:02.108
The steady pole
in the ground.

17:02.151 --> 17:04.632
Everyone else around youis like the flag,

17:04.675 --> 17:07.156
changing direction
as the wind shifts.

17:07.200 --> 17:08.157
But not you.

17:08.201 --> 17:09.898
You're keeping everythingin place.

17:09.941 --> 17:11.073
But the pole
gets no attention.

17:11.117 --> 17:14.076
We salute the flag
but not the pole.

17:14.120 --> 17:16.209
It might help you outevery once in a while

17:16.252 --> 17:17.297
if you were the flag.

17:18.341 --> 17:19.299
I think you're right.

17:19.342 --> 17:20.648
And beautiful metaphor.

17:20.691 --> 17:21.692
Thank you.

17:21.736 --> 17:24.130
You know,I hated that stupid flagpole,

17:24.173 --> 17:25.957
but suddenly,
it's useful to me.

17:26.001 --> 17:27.307
Marvin's gonna blow

17:27.350 --> 17:30.745
when Grandma tries todry her panties on that thing.

17:33.574 --> 17:35.097
I'm sorry, guys.

17:35.141 --> 17:37.534
I just don't trust myselfto keep that secret.

17:37.578 --> 17:39.101
Please,
Uncle Marvin?

17:39.145 --> 17:40.885
No way, José Canseco.

17:40.929 --> 17:42.539
I've spent
the last 40 years

17:42.583 --> 17:44.106
talking to patients
all day long,

17:44.150 --> 17:45.716
and now
I've got no outlet.

17:45.760 --> 17:46.891
And I'm a chatterbox.

17:46.935 --> 17:48.241
I mean, the minuteI run into somebody,

17:48.284 --> 17:50.330
I start chattering --
like a box.

17:50.373 --> 17:51.505
But you're a Navy man.

17:51.548 --> 17:53.159
Shouldn't you be able
to control yourself?

17:53.202 --> 17:57.337
Hey, us Navy guys are in controlon the ocean.

17:57.380 --> 17:58.947
But we're on land,
little buddies.

17:58.990 --> 18:00.296
All bets are off.

18:00.340 --> 18:02.124
Sea legs, land lips.

18:03.952 --> 18:05.954
Oh, by the way,
Queenie says "Hi."

18:05.997 --> 18:06.911
Wait.

18:06.955 --> 18:08.087
You talked to Queenie?

18:09.436 --> 18:10.393
Is that a threat?

18:10.437 --> 18:11.481
D--

18:11.525 --> 18:13.396
Did she tell you about...

18:13.440 --> 18:14.397
Angela?

18:15.181 --> 18:16.138
Angela?

18:17.748 --> 18:19.968
You don't know about Angela,do you?

18:20.011 --> 18:21.491
No.
But now we do.

18:21.535 --> 18:23.928
Just the lip leverage
we were looking for.

18:23.972 --> 18:25.713
How could you do this
to Honey?

18:25.756 --> 18:26.714
Who is she?

18:26.757 --> 18:29.151
No, Angela's the nameof my boat.

18:29.195 --> 18:31.371
I've been keeping her a secretfor years

18:31.414 --> 18:33.721
because Honey thought thata boat was a bad investment.

18:33.764 --> 18:36.245
But what about the boat
you got for retirement?

18:36.289 --> 18:37.725
Well,
it's the same boat.

18:37.768 --> 18:39.161
I gave old Angela
a wax job

18:39.205 --> 18:41.250
and then I pretendedthat I bought a new one.

18:42.295 --> 18:43.165
So please
don't tell Honey.

18:43.209 --> 18:46.212
How about we'll keep your secretif you keep ours?

18:46.255 --> 18:47.387
Yeah, that's a deal.

18:47.430 --> 18:48.736
We're brothers now,

18:48.779 --> 18:51.608
bound foreverby our shared secrets.

18:51.652 --> 18:53.567
I might even throw ina few weekend boat rides.

18:53.610 --> 18:55.438
My only rule --

18:55.482 --> 18:57.832
never, ever touch
the harpoon gun.

18:57.875 --> 19:00.400
It's for that seagullthat stole my hat.

19:04.578 --> 19:06.275
Louis: Hey, brother.

19:06.319 --> 19:07.537
♪ Yeah

19:07.581 --> 19:09.017
What are you doing?

19:09.060 --> 19:11.019
Trying to be
more like you.

19:11.062 --> 19:12.194
Oh.

19:12.238 --> 19:13.761
Because Hurricane Gene
is the kind of guy

19:13.804 --> 19:15.415
to put a hot tub
in a living room.

19:15.458 --> 19:16.416
"Clever."

19:16.459 --> 19:18.244
I'm trying to change,like you did.

19:18.287 --> 19:21.290
And the change I need is to bea little more unpredictable.

19:22.248 --> 19:23.292
But the carpets...

19:23.336 --> 19:24.380
I'm extremely worriedabout the carpets,

19:24.424 --> 19:25.599
but I'm letting that go.

19:25.642 --> 19:26.817
Can you hop in?

19:26.861 --> 19:28.602
I have a lotof apologizing to do,

19:28.645 --> 19:31.082
and we do our bestbrother-to-brother talks

19:31.126 --> 19:32.214
in hot water.

19:32.258 --> 19:34.651
Like in the hot springs
with Dad.

19:35.609 --> 19:38.264
I'm, uh,sorry about earlier.

19:38.307 --> 19:42.224
When you took over my roleof helping Ma, I struggled.

19:42.268 --> 19:43.399
But I am thankful

19:43.443 --> 19:45.445
for you teaching herto appreciate me.

19:45.488 --> 19:48.883
Boy, our family
didn't make it easy on you.

19:50.276 --> 19:51.407
And Hurricane Gene
wasn't easy on anyone.

19:51.451 --> 19:53.279
You, my wife...

19:53.322 --> 19:55.455
Oh, I'm sureshe's loving the new you.

19:55.498 --> 19:56.630
Wouldn't know.

19:56.673 --> 19:58.240
She left me, Louis.

19:58.284 --> 19:59.372
What?!

19:59.415 --> 20:00.677
When did that happen?

20:00.721 --> 20:01.809
It was recently --

20:01.852 --> 20:03.898
Actually, it was
over two years ago.

20:03.941 --> 20:07.423
But I was too ashamed
to talk about it to you or Mom.

20:07.467 --> 20:09.382
Wow.
I'm so sorry, Gene.

20:09.425 --> 20:10.513
It's okay.

20:10.557 --> 20:11.906
I'm actually better

20:11.949 --> 20:13.908
'cause it made me
look myself in the mirror

20:13.951 --> 20:15.823
and make some changes.

20:15.866 --> 20:18.304
Wait, so you didn'tfall into a lion pit?

20:18.347 --> 20:19.392
Oh, no, no, I did.

20:19.435 --> 20:21.916
It was an unrelated incident.
I'm super clumsy.

20:21.959 --> 20:24.135
Seriously,
just being here with you

20:24.179 --> 20:25.354
really made me
feel better.

20:25.398 --> 20:27.400
I mean, it always does.

20:27.443 --> 20:29.924
I didn't come here
just for Mom's retirement.

20:29.967 --> 20:32.840
Well, you're welcome hereanytime.

20:34.537 --> 20:36.931
Actually,
what is Mom retiring from?

20:37.975 --> 20:39.063
No idea.

20:39.107 --> 20:40.326
Okay.

20:45.505 --> 20:46.636
Okay, everybody's got it?

20:46.680 --> 20:48.856
Arms up.

20:48.899 --> 20:50.640
Five, six, seven, eight.

21:26.372 --> 21:27.982
Think that's a good idea.

21:28.025 --> 21:29.331
Hmm.
