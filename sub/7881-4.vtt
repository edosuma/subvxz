00:31.792 --> 00:34.250
Radishes are looking healthy.

00:34.291 --> 00:37.750
Strawberries have their seeds
on the outside. That's good.

00:37.792 --> 00:40.000
Zucchini
appropriately phallic...

00:40.041 --> 00:42.709
inducing slight feelings
of inadequacy.

00:42.750 --> 00:45.959
What the...! These tomatoes
are mired in the dirt!

00:45.959 --> 00:47.959
They're-they're in danger
of getting ground rot!

00:48.000 --> 00:49.250
They look okay to me.

00:49.291 --> 00:51.583
The day "okay" is good enough
for this garden club

00:51.625 --> 00:54.000
is the day I resign
as its president!

00:54.041 --> 00:55.625
We're co-presidents, Steve.

00:55.667 --> 00:57.333
Then start
acting like it!

00:57.375 --> 00:59.667
Oh, what nice
tomatoes.

00:59.709 --> 01:01.709
No, Mom, they're not.

01:02.750 --> 01:04.125
What are you doing here?

01:04.166 --> 01:06.583
You're making me look uncool
in front of the garden club!

01:06.625 --> 01:09.834
Gardening? Steve, that's
one of my four things!

01:09.875 --> 01:13.083
And you and I haven't
really done anything
together in a while.

01:13.125 --> 01:15.667
Can I join?
Gardening is
about creating

01:15.709 --> 01:18.083
something from nothing
and watching it grow.

01:18.125 --> 01:20.291
What would you know
about that, Mother?

01:21.500 --> 01:22.417
Pfft!

01:22.458 --> 01:23.917
Anyway...

01:24.000 --> 01:26.917
if we intend to have
gazpacho for Arbor Day,

01:26.959 --> 01:28.917
we're gonna need
a tomato cage, stat.

01:28.959 --> 01:30.750
To the gardening store!

01:30.792 --> 01:32.542
Ooh, maybe I
could drive you.

01:33.875 --> 01:36.291
We could play
car bingo!

01:36.333 --> 01:38.625
I'll let you smoke!

01:40.834 --> 01:42.583
I got to say,
I'm all a-tither

01:42.625 --> 01:45.125
for our big
performance.
I know, right?

01:45.166 --> 01:47.750
Russian balalaika trios
are gonna be the next big thing,

01:47.792 --> 01:50.583
and we'll be at the forefront,
raking in the rubles.

01:50.625 --> 01:52.166
Then where's our audience?

01:52.208 --> 01:54.291
Relax. People will show.

01:54.333 --> 01:56.375
I mean, we're the only
game in town, right?

01:56.417 --> 01:58.959
I mean, it's not like there's
anyone else in Langley Falls
working their asses off

01:59.000 --> 02:02.834
to keep alive the
orchestral folk traditions
of tsarist Russia!

02:04.083 --> 02:06.750
Just made my own sandwich
for the first time.

02:06.792 --> 02:08.834
Awful. Just awful.

02:08.875 --> 02:10.166
Mm. Mm.

02:10.208 --> 02:11.875
Oh, oh, oh, God.

02:13.250 --> 02:14.583
What's your drama, Mama?

02:14.625 --> 02:17.375
Steve doesn't want anything
to do with me anymore.

02:17.417 --> 02:19.792
We used to have
so much in common,

02:19.834 --> 02:22.208
but now...
Oh, it's all
perfectly natural.

02:22.250 --> 02:25.417
Steve is becoming a man,
and one aspect of being a man

02:25.458 --> 02:27.625
is having absolutely
no interest in women.

02:27.667 --> 02:29.500
I suppose
you're right.

02:29.542 --> 02:31.917
Of course I'm right--
because I'm a man.

02:31.959 --> 02:33.208
A man, Francine.

02:33.250 --> 02:35.083
From my head down
to my low-hanging...

02:40.166 --> 02:41.917
Ooh!

02:41.959 --> 02:44.125
Stan! Are you okay?

02:46.709 --> 02:50.375
This is
some thick-ass gauge wire.

02:50.417 --> 02:51.458
We're buying it.

02:51.458 --> 02:52.709
Barry, hand over
the money.

02:52.750 --> 02:54.041
I don't have
any money.

02:54.083 --> 02:55.542
But you're
the treasurer.

02:55.583 --> 02:58.083
We-we gave you all
of our club funds to manage.

02:58.125 --> 03:01.000
I spent it all
on dance moves!

03:02.041 --> 03:03.875
Jealous?

03:03.917 --> 03:05.041
A little.

03:05.083 --> 03:07.041
Aw, great.

03:07.083 --> 03:08.875
Well, we need this cage.

03:08.917 --> 03:12.417
So I guess we have no choice
but to steal it.

03:17.000 --> 03:21.250
Okay, so Toshi's in,
I'm in. You guys in?

03:21.291 --> 03:23.834
Okay, but how
are we gonna do it?

03:31.417 --> 03:33.083
That was awesome!

03:33.125 --> 03:35.417
What a rush!
I'm shaking.

03:35.458 --> 03:37.458
I want to rip something off!

03:37.500 --> 03:38.542
No, me!

03:38.583 --> 03:40.125
In time, fellows.

03:40.166 --> 03:41.583
But you're
just beginners,

03:41.625 --> 03:44.125
so we need to find a place
that's easy to steal from.

03:51.291 --> 03:52.166
I don't get it.

03:52.208 --> 03:53.417
Why didn't people come?

03:53.458 --> 03:55.917
We had 45 maybes
on our Evites.

03:55.959 --> 03:57.709
Hayley, "maybe" means no.

03:57.750 --> 04:00.583
The only place that
"maybe" means maybe is sex.

04:00.625 --> 04:01.792
Maybe.

04:05.000 --> 04:06.417
Okay, I'll bite.

04:06.458 --> 04:08.709
What's up with
the gyroscope
on his junk?

04:08.750 --> 04:10.667
Stan was... injured

04:10.709 --> 04:13.750
and went into a rare
condition known as...

04:13.792 --> 04:16.417
"testicular
retreat syndrome."

04:16.458 --> 04:19.667
His, um... nuggs
were so traumatized,

04:19.709 --> 04:22.375
they ran up into
his body to heal.

04:22.417 --> 04:24.166
What? Will he be okay?

04:24.208 --> 04:25.750
We don't know yet.

04:25.792 --> 04:27.834
They might drop down
again someday,

04:27.875 --> 04:30.417
but the doctors say
there's a good chance

04:30.458 --> 04:32.583
they'll just
die up there,

04:32.625 --> 04:36.041
like a gut-torn rabbit
in a wooded thicket.

04:36.083 --> 04:37.667
Wait, hold on a second.
I'm confused.

04:37.709 --> 04:41.041
Why the hell didn't
you dicks show up to our
balalaika concert?!

04:41.083 --> 04:42.583
I've got
bigger problems right now

04:42.625 --> 04:44.709
than supporting
your commie music!

04:47.083 --> 04:49.208
Stop! So what if I sound
a little feminine?

04:49.250 --> 04:52.166
Stop laughing and treat me
with the respect I deserve!

04:54.000 --> 04:55.625
My voice is not that...

04:56.875 --> 04:58.542
...not that high.

04:59.834 --> 05:01.458
It's a little higher
than usual.

05:08.750 --> 05:11.709
And that, Mr. Baby,
is why I vastly prefer

05:11.750 --> 05:15.000
a good round of marbles to
these confounded video games.

05:15.041 --> 05:17.959
Back in my day,
all we had to have fun

05:18.000 --> 05:20.834
was sleepy hobos and fire ants.

05:23.166 --> 05:25.417
Well, thanks for
the trip down memory lane,

05:25.458 --> 05:29.083
but there's a can outside,
and it's not gonna kick itself.

05:34.667 --> 05:36.125
Hold it right
there, son.

05:36.166 --> 05:37.750
Abort! Abort!

05:38.834 --> 05:40.917
What's in your
pocket there?

05:42.250 --> 05:44.709
And how about
your other pocket?

05:47.208 --> 05:49.709
I-I'm in a gardening club!

05:51.959 --> 05:54.417
There, there, sweetie.

Wh-What did they say?

06:04.458 --> 06:05.542
It's no use.

06:05.583 --> 06:07.458
There's no talking
sense into them...

06:07.500 --> 06:08.625

Jawohl. I lost my testes
when I became a fish.

06:18.625 --> 06:20.875
But being a fish isn't all bad.

Thank you for letting
Steve off with just
a warning, Mr. Baby.

06:58.750 --> 07:01.875
Well, you're lucky I'm just
a mom-and-pop operation.

07:01.917 --> 07:04.417
Technically,
just a pop operation,

07:04.458 --> 07:06.542
since the woman
I share my bed with

07:06.583 --> 07:09.125
is not the mother
of my children,

07:09.166 --> 07:13.208
but a toothless candy whore

07:13.250 --> 07:14.834
But the bigger
corporate stores

07:14.875 --> 07:16.709
won't be so forgiving

I haven't gotten
caught in 20 years.

08:20.750 --> 08:23.375

these treasures.

08:24.250 --> 08:26.333

From here on, consider
this balalaika trio kaputsky!

11:04.375 --> 11:06.250
Fine!

11:06.291 --> 11:08.875
Nothing will unite
us ever again!

11:08.917 --> 11:11.125
Presents!

11:13.000 --> 11:16.125
Hayley, this megaphone is
the absolute top-of-the-line.

11:16.166 --> 11:18.083
Certain to make you
the most annoying person

11:18.125 --> 11:19.709
at your next Occupy rally.

11:19.750 --> 11:21.834
Thanks, Dingus!

11:21.875 --> 11:25.083
Roger, I found you
this limited-edition

11:25.125 --> 11:28.083
porcelain doll
of JonBenet Ramsey...

11:28.125 --> 11:30.917
as an angel.

11:30.959 --> 11:33.875
Are you implying that there was
any version of her that wasn't?

11:33.917 --> 11:37.208
Oh, God, I love her so much!

11:37.250 --> 11:40.417
Klaus, we got you
a Tiffany fishbowl.

11:40.458 --> 11:41.792
It's just like
your regular fishbowl,

11:41.834 --> 11:43.750
except it's expensive
for some reason.

11:43.792 --> 11:46.959
Whatever, as long as I have
the blue box to show the girls!

11:47.000 --> 11:49.834
And finally, for Stan,

11:49.875 --> 11:52.750
a custom Rolex with
a special display

11:52.792 --> 11:56.667
that counts down the minutes
until Rachel Maddow's death!

12:02.375 --> 12:04.583
How did I pay for all this?

12:05.500 --> 12:08.000
Well... money, of course.

12:10.208 --> 12:11.667
Oh, who are
we kidding?!

12:11.709 --> 12:13.417
We lifted it!
We pinched it!

12:13.458 --> 12:15.583
We gave it the
old Zazzoo!

12:15.625 --> 12:17.834
I'm assuming
from context

12:17.875 --> 12:20.000
that old Zazzoo
also means stealing.

12:20.041 --> 12:21.709
Yes.

12:21.750 --> 12:23.959
I can't believe
what I'm hearing!

12:24.000 --> 12:26.000
Shoplifting?
Seriously, guys?

12:26.041 --> 12:27.333
For shame!

12:29.792 --> 12:32.000
Francine, what are we teaching
our children

12:32.041 --> 12:33.333
and aliens and fish?

12:33.375 --> 12:35.875
I may not have the authority
around here I once had,

12:35.917 --> 12:37.709
but damn it,
I still know what's right!

12:37.750 --> 12:40.333
I'm sorry, but Rachel Maddow's
death will just have

12:40.375 --> 12:42.458
to come
as a pleasant surprise to me.

12:42.500 --> 12:44.750
Promise me you two
will never steal again.

12:44.792 --> 12:47.875
Okay, Dad. I promise
we'll never shoplift again.

12:47.917 --> 12:49.417
Will we, Mom?

12:49.458 --> 12:50.625
Okay.

12:51.709 --> 12:52.917
Are we
done here?

12:52.959 --> 12:54.583
'Cause we were in the
middle of a storm-off.

12:54.625 --> 12:57.208
Our balalaika
trio is finished!

13:00.875 --> 13:02.458
Dad, are you bathing?

13:02.500 --> 13:05.000
'Cause it-it smells
like you're...

13:05.041 --> 13:06.250
not bathing.

13:10.375 --> 13:12.625
Well, this is still fun.

13:12.667 --> 13:16.166
I mean, we're
hanging out.

13:16.250 --> 13:18.917
Um, we don't have to
hang out at the mall.

13:18.959 --> 13:20.500
We could always
get a motorcycle

13:20.542 --> 13:23.500
with a sidecar
and find lost dogs!

13:23.542 --> 13:25.291
Yeah. See you later, Mom.

13:25.333 --> 13:27.834
Wait! What if we
shoplift again?

13:27.875 --> 13:28.959
What?

13:29.000 --> 13:31.667
I mean... we can't
go out like this.

13:31.709 --> 13:33.583
We got to have
one final heist.

13:33.625 --> 13:35.291
But we promised Dad.

13:35.333 --> 13:37.709
Look, this isn't just any heist.

13:37.750 --> 13:41.792
I'm talking
about hitting The Gash.

13:43.250 --> 13:44.750
The Gash?!

13:44.792 --> 13:46.500
You mean I'm finally ready?

13:46.542 --> 13:47.834
No, Steve.

13:47.875 --> 13:49.959
We're ready.

13:50.000 --> 13:51.542
Yeah, you're ready!

13:51.583 --> 13:53.625
I'm liking
that confidence!

13:53.667 --> 13:55.750
Anyway, what's next?

13:55.792 --> 13:57.458
Where we going?

13:58.917 --> 14:01.375
Okay, I'll create
a distraction

14:01.417 --> 14:04.000
while you run a
reverse snatch-and-grab

14:04.041 --> 14:05.667
down the cardigan table.

14:05.709 --> 14:08.125
Meet at the
fountain at 2:00.

14:08.166 --> 14:09.291
Got it.

14:10.875 --> 14:12.333
Excuse me.

14:12.375 --> 14:15.792
I think there's something
wrong with this changing room.

14:17.417 --> 14:19.458
Oh, she is good.

14:26.417 --> 14:27.917
Huh.

14:27.959 --> 14:31.750
Excuse me. Have you seen
my beautiful boy?

14:33.291 --> 14:34.625
Yeah, he was here.

14:34.667 --> 14:37.291
But our Loss Prevention
Unit has him now.

14:42.083 --> 14:43.250
Aah!

14:43.291 --> 14:44.667
Hi there, shoplifter!

14:44.709 --> 14:46.208
Welcome to The Gash...

14:46.250 --> 14:47.208
sweatshop!

14:58.125 --> 14:59.417
Excuse me, miss?

14:59.458 --> 15:00.834
Hi. How can I help you today?

15:00.875 --> 15:03.875
I was just wondering, who's
my union representative?

15:03.917 --> 15:05.875
Okay. Oh.

15:05.917 --> 15:07.583
Anything else
I can help you with?

15:07.625 --> 15:08.875
No, thanks.

15:08.917 --> 15:11.917
Okay, well, my name's Harper
if you need anything.

15:13.542 --> 15:14.917
How long have
you been here?

15:14.959 --> 15:16.500
20 years.

15:16.542 --> 15:19.625
Oh, my God, I just realized
I can't take it anymore!

15:24.166 --> 15:26.709
No! Not the sweater fold!

15:34.083 --> 15:36.250
Stan!

15:36.291 --> 15:38.000
I'm sorry. I ran
all the way home

15:38.041 --> 15:40.250
because I forgot
I had my car with me.

15:40.291 --> 15:45.083
The Gash's Loss Prevention Unit
caught Steve shoplifting!

15:45.125 --> 15:47.250
You guys were
shoplifting again?

15:47.291 --> 15:48.542
Skip the lecture.

15:48.583 --> 15:51.041
When people get caught
shoplifting from The Gash,

15:51.083 --> 15:53.917
they're never
heard from again.

15:53.959 --> 15:55.417
Well, I wish
I could help you,

15:55.458 --> 15:57.625
but I am powerless
without my nuggs.

15:57.667 --> 15:59.667
Only you can save our son.

15:59.709 --> 16:01.917
You're the man
of the house now.

16:08.875 --> 16:10.166
Good-bye, Stan.

16:11.500 --> 16:14.041
Do whatever it takes
to get Steve back.

as a quartet.

17:51.166 --> 17:52.542
How about
it, Daddy?

17:52.583 --> 17:54.417
I suppose
I could give it a try.

17:54.458 --> 17:55.375
Yay!

17:55.417 --> 17:57.125
Yes!
Yeah, it'll be fun, right?

17:57.166 --> 17:58.542
I mean, this could be
just what I need

17:58.583 --> 17:59.917
to get me out
of this living room.

17:59.959 --> 18:02.291
And back into life.

18:02.333 --> 18:03.375
My boys just dropped!

18:03.417 --> 18:04.583
No, no. No!

18:04.625 --> 18:06.583
Thank God.
I'm back to normal.

18:06.625 --> 18:07.792
I don't have to settle

18:07.834 --> 18:09.875
for a life of singing
with you idiots after all.

♪ Swing low,
sweet chariot... ♪

18:17.500 --> 18:18.792
Ah, to hell

18:23.333 --> 18:24.709
Hello.

18:24.750 --> 18:27.458
Welcome to The Gash's
infamous third-world sweatshop.

18:27.500 --> 18:28.667
Hola.

18:28.709 --> 18:31.875
I'm an inspector from...
the government.

18:31.917 --> 18:36.041
We have concerns your sweatshop
isn't cruel enough.

18:36.083 --> 18:37.458
Ridiculous!

18:37.500 --> 18:40.917
As you can see, our facility
is exceptionally cruel.

18:40.959 --> 18:41.959
Our workers may pray

18:42.000 --> 18:44.375
for freedom,
but they hope for death.

18:44.417 --> 18:46.834
Oh, what a pretty coat!

18:46.875 --> 18:47.959
What's your name?

18:48.000 --> 18:50.333
Worker 39872.

18:50.375 --> 18:52.667
But I used
to be called Matilda.

18:52.709 --> 18:54.750
I don't like the spunk
in this one.

18:54.792 --> 18:57.250
Seems like she still
has some will to live.

18:57.291 --> 18:59.041
I'll interview her alone.

19:00.959 --> 19:02.875
Okay, Matilda, here's the deal.

19:02.917 --> 19:04.583
I'm not really an inspector.

19:04.625 --> 19:06.458
I'm a shoplifter,
just like you.

19:06.500 --> 19:07.917
Are-are you the one?

19:07.959 --> 19:10.125
The savior foretold
in our legends

19:10.166 --> 19:11.959
come to free us
from our bondage?

19:12.000 --> 19:13.667
Huh? No.

19:13.709 --> 19:15.667
Oh. That sucks.

19:15.709 --> 19:17.875
Have you seen this kid
around here?

19:17.917 --> 19:19.250
Well, I don't know him,

19:19.291 --> 19:23.208
but, uh, the latest batch of
arrivals ended up in Zone Q.

19:23.250 --> 19:25.667
Wait! If-if you're getting
out of here,

19:25.709 --> 19:27.375
could you take me with you?

19:28.333 --> 19:30.875
You have my
word, Matilda.

19:39.792 --> 19:41.417
Steve?!

19:42.375 --> 19:44.125
Floobity-floobity!

19:45.667 --> 19:46.750
Mom?!

19:46.792 --> 19:47.875
Steve!

19:48.667 --> 19:49.583
Let's get out of here.

19:49.625 --> 19:51.166
What about my sensor tag?

19:51.208 --> 19:52.792
You'll never get me
through those gates.

19:54.583 --> 19:56.000
Whoa. How'd you do that?

19:56.041 --> 19:57.750
This is me we're
talking about.

19:57.792 --> 20:01.375
The woman who once crotchwalked
an oven out of a Sears.

20:01.417 --> 20:02.750
Crotchwalked?

20:03.417 --> 20:04.375
Oh, dear.

20:07.917 --> 20:09.000
Thanks for the access.

20:09.041 --> 20:11.875
I'll be sure to give
a favorable report.

20:11.917 --> 20:13.583
Thank you,
and may I just say,

20:13.625 --> 20:15.500
you look in no way
suspicious to me.

20:17.917 --> 20:19.542
Aah!

20:19.583 --> 20:20.875
Just send me
back to work.

20:20.917 --> 20:22.375
I can't be
all up in that.

20:22.417 --> 20:24.542
She's trying
to liberate a shoplifter!

20:24.583 --> 20:25.750
Seize them!

20:25.792 --> 20:28.375
I'm really
sorry, Mom.

20:28.417 --> 20:29.542
I blew it
for both of us.

20:29.583 --> 20:31.625
You didn't blow
anything, sweetie.

20:31.667 --> 20:36.166
I've still got one last
shoplifting trick up my sleeve.

20:40.750 --> 20:42.709
Not really
a shoplifting trick

20:42.750 --> 20:44.917
so much as one
of Dad's grenades, Mom.

20:44.959 --> 20:46.959
Hey, it worked
at Macy's!

20:56.125 --> 20:57.458
Matilda!

21:15.917 --> 21:18.083
Bitch.

21:29.917 --> 21:31.500
Bye! Have a beautiful time.
