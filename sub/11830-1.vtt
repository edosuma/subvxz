through a series

23:08.737 --> 23:11.440
Last time I was
going through a divorce.
Yes.

23:11.507 --> 23:15.511
Because your wife
finally had it when, in front
of your own grandchildren,

23:15.579 --> 23:18.181
you exposed yourself
to Goofy at Disneyland.

23:18.247 --> 23:20.216
I thought it was Pluto.

23:25.655 --> 23:28.658
Look at me,
Mr. Holsten.

23:28.725 --> 23:31.996
Do I look amused?

23:32.062 --> 23:35.132
I have a lot of clients,
and some of 'em are good people.

23:35.199 --> 23:38.035
And they count on me
to give them
effective representation.

23:38.102 --> 23:40.405
To do that,
I need my credibility...

23:40.471 --> 23:43.308
so that when I look
a judge or a probation officer
in the eye...

23:43.374 --> 23:47.646
and say that
it won't happen again,
I gotta believe that it won't.

23:47.713 --> 23:49.715
Is this going
to happen again?

23:53.118 --> 23:55.621
Look at me.

23:58.590 --> 24:02.061
Will... this...
happen again?

24:05.031 --> 24:06.899
I don't know.

24:12.605 --> 24:14.807
Okay.

24:14.874 --> 24:17.244
Uh,

24:17.310 --> 24:19.880
we gotta
get you some help.

24:19.947 --> 24:22.515
I'm sorry
for all the animosity.

24:22.583 --> 24:26.186
Mr. Ray has become
very frustrated.
You needn't apologize.

24:26.253 --> 24:31.192
In your type of practice,
you're dealing with, uh,
an element.

24:31.259 --> 24:34.262
You just try to be
the best lawyer you can
and navigate your clientele...

24:34.328 --> 24:36.798
through a process
which is foreign to them.

24:38.366 --> 24:40.334
That your case
is unwinnable...

24:40.401 --> 24:43.872
no doubt compounds
the frustration,
both his and yours.

24:43.938 --> 24:47.976
W-Well, uh, I-- I don't think
it's unwinnable.

24:48.043 --> 24:49.979
[ Chuckles ]
Lindsay, you're butting heads...

24:50.045 --> 24:52.047
with a billion-dollar
tobacco company.

24:55.350 --> 24:58.721
I'm gonna tell you something
off the record.

24:58.788 --> 25:02.358
Friend to friend, okay?
Okay.

25:02.425 --> 25:06.862
Our defense strategy is not
just to prevail on the merits
of the individual case,

25:06.930 --> 25:10.066
but to do so in such a manner
as to give pause...

25:10.133 --> 25:13.904
to any future plaintiff,
if you follow me.

25:13.970 --> 25:16.006
- I don't.
- I'm sure you do.

25:16.072 --> 25:19.543
I should also tell you
that Michaels,
on principle alone,

25:19.610 --> 25:22.513
refuses to pay anything.

25:22.579 --> 25:24.315
The precedent is
just too dangerous.

25:24.381 --> 25:28.185
Well, then I guess
we have nothing to discuss.

25:28.252 --> 25:30.087
No, no. Not so fast.

25:30.154 --> 25:33.591
I'm quite mindful
that spending dollars...

25:33.658 --> 25:38.029
to defend against
nickels and dimes
defies economic logic.

25:38.096 --> 25:41.633
No, what I would like
to do here...

25:41.699 --> 25:43.535
is book the bet,
if you will.

25:43.601 --> 25:47.472
I beg your pardon?
You give me a release,
I won't even file it.

25:47.540 --> 25:52.778
I'll put it in my desk drawer.
I give you 18,000
from Finley, not Michaels.

25:52.845 --> 25:55.214
It comes from Finley Hogue.

25:55.281 --> 25:58.251
We recoup from Michaels later,
billing it under legal fees.

25:59.819 --> 26:02.521
But i-is that even legal?

26:02.589 --> 26:05.291
Yes.
And who does it hurt?

26:05.358 --> 26:08.127
Your client gets money
otherwise he wouldn't see,

26:08.194 --> 26:11.831
and my client makes the case
go away for far less cost...

26:11.898 --> 26:13.867
with no precedent
to worry about.

26:16.837 --> 26:19.273
Eighteen is kind of low.
[ Chuckling ]
Well,

26:19.339 --> 26:21.241
that's all I'm gonna offer.

26:21.308 --> 26:25.112
And that's
considerably more than nothing,
which is the only alternative.

26:25.179 --> 26:29.117
I'll have to think about it.
Well, all right.
Fine. Fine.

26:32.753 --> 26:35.857
Lindsay?

26:35.924 --> 26:38.960
What are you doing?
I'm sorry?

26:39.027 --> 26:43.131
Bobby Donnell is
a good practitioner,
don't misunderstand me,

26:43.199 --> 26:45.401
but that's what he is,
a practitioner.

26:45.467 --> 26:48.604
You studied to be a lawyer.

26:48.670 --> 26:51.207
I-- I don't mean
to speak out of turn.

26:51.273 --> 26:54.276
It's just,
I should hate to see you
waste your gift.

26:54.343 --> 26:57.246
And you do have a gift.

27:00.016 --> 27:02.919
I'll review your offer
with my client
and get back to you.

27:04.687 --> 27:06.790
Thank you.

27:09.192 --> 27:12.430
[ Judge ]
Do you want to run
that by me one more time?

27:12.496 --> 27:15.933
I want to say in my summation
that she was offered four months
and turned it down.

27:15.999 --> 27:18.102
He's on something.
I also want
the jury to know...

27:18.169 --> 27:20.438
that a conviction means
an automatic 15 years.

27:20.504 --> 27:23.875
I see. Any particular reason
why the rules of evidence
shouldn't apply to you?

27:23.942 --> 27:26.110
Sometimes the rules
pervert things.

27:26.177 --> 27:29.113
If plea bargain offers
become admissible,
D.A.'s won't make them.

27:29.180 --> 27:31.583
She was good enough
to offer you four months.

27:31.650 --> 27:34.553
Do you want to shove that
back down her throat?
The jury should know...

27:34.619 --> 27:37.722
that Rachel had the integrity
to turn down four months--
Don't point your finger.

27:37.789 --> 27:41.026
and that a conviction puts her
away until she is 30 years old!
They won't know that!

27:41.093 --> 27:43.362
- What kind of fairness is this?
I don't understand!
- They won't know it!

27:43.428 --> 27:46.031
You're putting the system
before a person's life here!

27:46.098 --> 27:49.068
Damn right I am!
That's why I wear the robe.

27:49.134 --> 27:51.837
[ Sighs ]
Okay. Suppose it just slips out.

27:51.904 --> 27:55.075
I'm doing my closing,
stream-of-consciousness kind of
thing, and it just comes out.

27:55.141 --> 27:57.077
Let me make this
easy for you.

27:57.143 --> 28:01.915
Breathe so much as a word about
that 10 or four month offer--
Now you're pointing.

28:01.982 --> 28:04.217
I'm the judge!
I get to point!

28:04.284 --> 28:07.020
So much as suggest anything
about a plea bargain,

28:07.087 --> 28:10.391
even hint at what the prison
term will be, you not only
buy yourself a mistrial...

28:10.457 --> 28:13.861
but also a jail cell
of your very own.

28:15.596 --> 28:18.232
Do you hear me, counsel?

28:18.299 --> 28:20.868
Don't test me.

28:29.077 --> 28:31.613
Sticking together.
No, no, no.

29:02.346 --> 29:05.983

I'm going over my closing.

29:06.050 --> 29:09.620
- Don't you ever go home?
- No. Do you?

29:12.623 --> 29:14.392
How'd it go with Emerson Ray?

29:14.459 --> 29:18.229
Oh, fine. They want--
Eh, it's going fine.

29:21.132 --> 29:24.435
Can I ask you something?
Hmm.

29:24.502 --> 29:26.772
Do you have a girlfriend?

29:26.838 --> 29:28.874
What?

29:28.940 --> 29:31.177
No, I-- I don't mean for me.
I just--

29:31.243 --> 29:33.112
Well--

29:33.179 --> 29:36.048
Sometimes I get
insecure that, you know,

29:36.115 --> 29:38.650
in, like,
seven or eight years or so,

29:38.717 --> 29:42.522
I'll be alone,
pacing my office at night,
talking to myself and that--

29:44.557 --> 29:47.994
Oh, I didn't mean that
the way it came out.
I really didn't.

29:49.262 --> 29:53.366
Yeah. You're worried that, uh,
you'll wind up like me?

29:53.433 --> 29:56.069
No. N-N-N-N-No. No, no.
I just meant that--

29:56.136 --> 29:59.139
Not that it's any
of your business, but, uh,

30:01.775 --> 30:03.777
I, um-- um--

30:03.844 --> 30:06.880
I'm in between relationships.

30:06.947 --> 30:11.019
And the reason
that I'm in my office
talking to myself is,

30:11.085 --> 30:16.625
if I don't give the closing
of my life tomorrow,

30:16.691 --> 30:20.395
a 17-year-old girl
loses hers.

30:25.667 --> 30:28.270
Probably forever.

30:31.941 --> 30:34.477

the way it came out.

afraid of getting nothing.

31:37.944 --> 31:40.547
Eighteen is low,
even for nuisance.

31:40.614 --> 31:43.517
Here's the thing.
Their lawyer used to be
one of my law professors.

31:43.583 --> 31:47.321
He told me off the record
Michaels refuses
to offer anything. It's policy.

31:47.387 --> 31:49.356
But I think because
of our relationship,

31:49.423 --> 31:52.159
he's willing
to throw me 18
paid by Finley...

31:52.226 --> 31:54.328
and then bury the cost
in legal fees to Michaels.

31:54.394 --> 31:56.363
What time's your meeting?

31:56.430 --> 31:59.199

I'm coming to the meeting.

31:59.266 --> 32:00.435

What time?

What time?

32:02.203 --> 32:04.172

I didn't accept!

32:04.239 --> 32:06.107
We can't put
the drug dealers away.

32:06.174 --> 32:09.610
We can't keep the streets
safe for our children.
Crime is winning.

32:09.677 --> 32:11.813
Well, you know what?

32:11.880 --> 32:14.516
It is hard
getting convictions.

32:14.583 --> 32:19.087
But if we don't get this one--
caught with the drugs
right in her hand,

32:19.154 --> 32:21.557
<i>street value of $100,000--</i>

32:21.623 --> 32:24.927
caught stuffing cutoff baggies
of cocaine into a pillowcase.

32:24.994 --> 32:27.263
If we can't even convict here--

32:33.736 --> 32:37.474
Mr. Donnell says
that's all they have.

32:37.540 --> 32:41.378
My poor client was arrested
just because...

32:41.444 --> 32:43.981
she had the drugs
in her hand.

32:44.047 --> 32:46.917
How awful.
That is like saying...

32:46.984 --> 32:51.121
the police arrested the guy
for murder just because
when they heard the shots...

32:51.188 --> 32:56.194
he was standing over the
dead body with a smoking gun,
and it just isn't fair.

32:56.260 --> 32:58.596
Use your common sense.

32:58.662 --> 33:02.266
She lied for her brother.
She admitted she was dishonest.

33:02.333 --> 33:06.170
She was shoving
cocaine into a sack.

33:07.972 --> 33:10.542
You know, there's a saying
among defense attorneys:

33:12.044 --> 33:14.646
Juries are made up
of 12 people...

33:14.713 --> 33:17.850
who are too stupid
to get out of jury duty.

33:19.384 --> 33:23.355
So, hell, even if your client
is caught cold, don't give up.

33:23.423 --> 33:27.327
You've got no case,
no defense,
you've still got a jury.

<i>That woman facilitated</i>
<i>drug trafficking.</i>
<i>It's very simple.</i>

People today laugh at juries.

33:42.743 --> 33:45.212
I hope they don't laugh
at this one.

34:22.717 --> 34:26.389
You know, I--
I came back to my office
the other day,

34:26.455 --> 34:31.293
and I found one of
my associates in tears.

34:31.360 --> 34:34.331
<i>She had just won</i>
<i>this suppression hearing,</i>

34:34.398 --> 34:36.565
and she was upset
over the career prospect...

34:36.632 --> 34:38.502
of putting drug dealers
back on the street.

34:38.568 --> 34:41.271
'Cause that's what we do a lot.

34:41.338 --> 34:43.373
When you do
criminal defense work,

34:43.440 --> 34:47.277
you spend a lot of time
trying to help guilty people.

34:47.344 --> 34:49.347
And after a while,
it just--

34:49.414 --> 34:52.417
it just wears on you
to the point where you think,

34:52.483 --> 34:54.552
"Why the hell
do you do it?"

34:56.687 --> 34:58.724
You want to know why
I do it?

35:01.860 --> 35:03.929
<i>That's why.</i>

35:06.998 --> 35:11.003
Because every once in a while,

35:11.070 --> 35:13.906

35:18.945 --> 35:21.414
<i>he or she didn't do,</i>

and it becomes up to me
to fight their fight.

35:26.153 --> 35:29.522
Rachel Reynolds's
only crime here...

35:29.589 --> 35:32.693
was trying
to help her brother.

35:33.794 --> 35:35.796
And who amongst us
can't understand that?

of family, isn't it?

35:42.270 --> 35:47.008
Now, you can choose
to disbelieve her.
I can't stop you.

35:47.075 --> 35:49.878
You can give in to
the same kind
of jaded cynicism...

35:49.944 --> 35:52.046

and think,

35:52.113 --> 35:54.048

But if you do that,
the only thing
you prove here today...

is that you don't know
Rachel Reynolds.

See, you may not know this,

have to play by certain rules
when they try a case.

[ Snaps Fingers ]

be thrown in jail.

says a lawyer can't knowingly
put up false evidence.

He can't say something
to the jury
he knows to be untrue,

37:18.137 --> 37:21.074

I can't stand here before you...

is innocent of the crime charged
if I know otherwise.

I can say the State
didn't meet its burden.

It didn't prove guilt.
It didn't satisfy the standard
beyond all reasonable doubt.
