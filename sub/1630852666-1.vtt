WEBVTT

00:30.023 --> 00:32.925
I've actually lost a lot of
friends in music and comedy

00:32.959 --> 00:35.795
to substance abuse
and it, and it kills me, man,

00:35.828 --> 00:38.898
because you don't need
drugs. You really don't.

00:38.931 --> 00:40.432
I am living proof
that you can destroy

00:40.465 --> 00:42.434
your life completely
sober, guys, I am.

00:44.103 --> 00:46.072
And I'm not trying to brag,
I just never let drugs

00:46.105 --> 00:48.741
and alcohol come between
me and failure, okay?

00:48.775 --> 00:50.475
It's mine, all right?

00:50.509 --> 00:54.279
I have achieved this on my own.
No help from drugs!

01:10.163 --> 01:13.298

01:44.563 --> 01:46.531
I also took this
time during COVID

01:46.565 --> 01:49.669
and the social distancing
to come out the closet.

01:49.702 --> 01:52.905
I'm Black. Don't let
anyone ever

01:52.939 --> 01:54.974
make you feel like it's
a choice.

01:55.440 --> 01:57.143
- Yo.
- What's up, boss?

01:57.176 --> 01:59.078
Hey, uh, dude, I've been
trying to get up on stage

01:59.112 --> 02:00.512
for like a couple of months now.

02:00.545 --> 02:02.715
Do you think you can
like help me out?

02:02.749 --> 02:04.984
- Um...
- What you got, bro?

02:05.017 --> 02:06.219
Kind of embarrassing.

02:06.251 --> 02:08.054
- Two dollars?
- Yeah.

02:08.087 --> 02:09.554
What the fuck, man?

02:11.023 --> 02:12.158
Fuck it, you're on deck, man.

02:12.191 --> 02:13.860
- All right.
- Name?

02:13.893 --> 02:16.162
Arnold? Arnold Wilson.

02:16.195 --> 02:18.698
- Gotcha, bro.
- Thanks. I got... I'll... get you.

02:18.731 --> 02:20.465
Tip the fucking
bartender, bro.

02:27.240 --> 02:29.242
All right, everybody,
that was Philly Ricin.

02:29.274 --> 02:31.077
Give it up for Philly.
All right.

02:31.110 --> 02:35.047
Next up coming to the stage,
we have... big spender...

02:35.081 --> 02:36.883
Arnold Wilson! Give it up
for Arnold.

02:39.118 --> 02:42.354
Arnold Wilson, let's go!

02:42.387 --> 02:44.123
Where the fuck
is this guy?

02:44.991 --> 02:46.092
Do you wanna go up?

02:52.597 --> 02:53.699
Hey, for

02:53.733 --> 02:55.668
- Benjamin?
- Cool. Jinx.

03:04.277 --> 03:05.678
You from LA?

03:06.444 --> 03:09.381
From Dayton, Ohio.
Middle of nowhere.

03:09.414 --> 03:13.085
Kinda like if all the meth
in America got together and...

03:13.119 --> 03:14.253
created a town.

03:16.155 --> 03:18.224
- You an actor?
- No. Uh...

03:18.257 --> 03:20.827
I actually moved
here to try to do comedy.

03:20.860 --> 03:22.295
You kind of look
like a comedian.

03:29.635 --> 03:31.304
Oh yeah, that's good.

03:32.138 --> 03:34.406
Oh, yeah, you want a bump?

03:35.942 --> 03:40.746
Uh... Nah, I...
I shouldn't, man. Um...

03:42.315 --> 03:44.183
Eh, fuck it. Why not?

03:44.217 --> 03:46.652
Line it up.
Let's fucking do this.

03:50.957 --> 03:52.357
Two minutes!

03:52.390 --> 03:55.594
Piss in the bathroom
or outside, I don't give a shit!

03:55.628 --> 03:58.197
There's two fucking minutes!

03:58.231 --> 04:00.666
Oh, Rob. Good to see ya.

04:06.806 --> 04:08.708
I'm <i>so</i> sorry!

04:08.741 --> 04:11.143
I promise I'll pay you back
everything I owe you.

04:11.177 --> 04:13.312
I'm so sick of this.

04:13.346 --> 04:15.882
We were supposed to do shit
when we moved out here.

04:15.915 --> 04:18.885
I didn't come here to pay
your rent and bail you out.

04:18.918 --> 04:22.188
I pay rent; I want...
I want to pay rent.

04:23.923 --> 04:25.024
Can you just listen?

04:25.057 --> 04:26.759
Last night was an accident.

04:26.792 --> 04:28.794
It's not like this
happens every <i>da</i>.

04:28.828 --> 04:31.197
Drunk driving when your only
source of income is driving

04:31.230 --> 04:32.999
- is not an accident.
- I didn't drink.

04:33.032 --> 04:35.067
In my car, nonetheless.

04:35.101 --> 04:38.237
Now your license is revoked.
What are you gonna do?

04:38.271 --> 04:41.374
Can you just relax and just
like stop being so emotional?

04:42.008 --> 04:44.677
- Fuck you, Arnold.
- What?

04:44.710 --> 04:46.345
Are you kidding?

04:46.379 --> 04:50.983
Hey! Hey, hey. Listen, I'm...
I'm sorry. Will you just listen?

04:51.851 --> 04:54.486
I'm sorry. I'll take my stuff

04:54.519 --> 04:57.156
and I'll take the van and I'll
go stay at a friend's.

04:57.189 --> 04:58.958
You need to stay here.

05:00.059 --> 05:02.161
You don't have any friends.

05:02.194 --> 05:03.396
Oh, okay.

05:12.104 --> 05:13.605
All right, thank you very much.

05:13.639 --> 05:15.274
I appreciate that, man.

05:15.308 --> 05:18.144
It's good to see you guys.
Great to be here doing comedy,

05:18.177 --> 05:19.946
mainly 'cause I spent the last
decade of my life

05:19.979 --> 05:23.382
playing in a bunch of bands that
have failed frickin' miserably!

05:23.416 --> 05:25.583
But it's all right.
I'm working through it.

05:25.617 --> 05:27.353
I just wish there
was a support group called

05:27.386 --> 05:29.221
Rockaholics Anonymous.
That way you can be like,

05:29.255 --> 05:31.290
"So, just completed step
four of my recovery."

05:31.324 --> 05:33.793
That's just where you have
to stop snorting lines of ants

05:33.826 --> 05:35.261
off of Sunset Boulevard...

05:35.294 --> 05:37.063
Step six is being funny.

05:37.096 --> 05:38.530
Yeah, and step six
is figuring out

05:38.563 --> 05:40.232
what fucking look it is
you're going for, man.

05:40.266 --> 05:42.702
You can't be fat and a hipster
at the same time.

05:42.735 --> 05:45.037
- Fuck you, lesbian.
- I might look like a lesbian,

05:45.071 --> 05:46.571
but it's a hell of a lot better
than that whole

05:46.604 --> 05:48.741
lumber-sexual thing
that you got going on, bro.

05:48.774 --> 05:52.111
It was 95 degrees
in Los Angeles today, okay?

05:52.144 --> 05:54.447
You've got a beard,
a flannel with skinny jeans.

05:54.479 --> 05:57.316
What, you want us to believe you're gonna
go chop wood in Silverlake after this,

05:57.350 --> 05:59.584
dressed as fucking
Paul Bunyan's gay stepson?

05:59.617 --> 06:02.421
They're laughing at you, yeah!

06:02.455 --> 06:03.823
Why don't you try
saying something to me

06:03.856 --> 06:05.424
- without a microphone, dick?
- Bro, hey, I'm just

06:05.458 --> 06:06.826
- trying to do my job, man.
- Hey, get the fuck

06:06.859 --> 06:08.127
- outta here dude.
- Oh my God.

06:08.160 --> 06:09.829
- Jesus Christ.
- The fuck is wrong with you,

06:09.862 --> 06:12.331
- you fuck?
- Dude, oh my God!

06:12.365 --> 06:14.133
- Fuck you, dude.
- Yeah.

06:14.166 --> 06:15.668
Dude, it's a good
thing you're here.

06:15.701 --> 06:17.903
I didn't feel like
murdering somebody tonight.

06:17.937 --> 06:19.905
- Yeah.
- I can't afford to get arrested

06:19.939 --> 06:21.774
with my career peaking
like it is, you know?

06:21.807 --> 06:23.608
Maybe not
with the whole...

06:23.642 --> 06:26.846
lesbian Kevin Bacon thing you
got going on, but uh...

06:26.879 --> 06:28.681
That's pretty funny.
You got me on that, yeah.

06:28.714 --> 06:30.182
- Yeah.
- Yeah

06:30.216 --> 06:32.451
Hey... You should try to get
on stage, man.

06:32.485 --> 06:34.519
You should do it. If you're
thinking about it, just do it.

06:34.552 --> 06:36.022
Yeah...

06:36.055 --> 06:39.191
I mean, sometimes... I do sign
up for open mics, but...

06:40.359 --> 06:42.194
Nah, I'm fucking chicken shit.

06:42.228 --> 06:44.663
Second my name gets called,
I run out of there. It's embarrassing.

06:44.697 --> 06:46.165
You're telling me
that you have no problem

06:46.198 --> 06:48.868
breaking up a fight between
two total strangers,

06:48.901 --> 06:51.270
but you're too afraid
to go on stage?

06:52.872 --> 06:55.007
So, uh... Where's your ride?

06:55.041 --> 06:56.842
I'm actually... uh, parked
down the street.

06:56.876 --> 06:58.310
I can give you a ride
over there.

06:58.344 --> 07:00.679
Nah, I'm good, man.
I'm cool to walk, yeah.

07:00.713 --> 07:02.148
It's no big deal,
I'll give you a ride.

07:02.181 --> 07:03.816
I'm not gonna try
to have sex with you.

07:03.849 --> 07:06.419
Jesus, what are you,
homeless or something?

07:10.256 --> 07:11.857
Dude, are you homeless?

07:12.491 --> 07:14.326
I'm...

07:14.360 --> 07:16.662
Listen, can you just...
fuck off right now?

07:16.695 --> 07:18.864
- I just don't want to talk.
- Hey, it... It's nothing to worry about,

07:18.898 --> 07:21.167
- I can give you a ride.
- Dude, fuck off! Okay?

07:21.200 --> 07:22.668
- Okay.
- Fuck!

07:22.701 --> 07:23.836
Asshole.

07:23.869 --> 07:25.304
You don't fucking know me.

07:50.029 --> 07:52.164
Fucking!

07:52.198 --> 07:54.166
Fucking stupid...

07:58.304 --> 07:59.505
Fuck!

08:03.542 --> 08:06.512
Fuck, all right!
One knock is enough.

08:06.545 --> 08:08.881
Look, buddy, there's
no sleeping out here.

08:08.914 --> 08:10.549
I've got landlords...

08:10.583 --> 08:12.617
- Oh, fuck.
- Holy shit!

08:12.651 --> 08:14.253
Rapey van guy!

08:14.286 --> 08:16.055
Oh my God, kicking you
out of here is

08:16.088 --> 08:17.923
- definitely going in my spank bank tonight.
- All right.

08:17.957 --> 08:20.259
- Man, I'm sorry about last night.
- You should be.

08:20.292 --> 08:21.894
Yeah, it was my
fault, I know that.

08:21.927 --> 08:23.896
But my van broke down
and I had nowhere to go.

08:23.929 --> 08:26.065
Tough shit, asshole.
Beat it.

08:26.098 --> 08:27.733
Hey man, you think I really
want to be

08:27.766 --> 08:29.368
parked next to this fucking
shithole?

08:29.401 --> 08:31.437
This is a place of business.

08:33.472 --> 08:35.441
Fuck! We have a restroom!

08:35.474 --> 08:38.544
Griff, we are right next
to a 7-Eleven for Christ's sake.

08:38.577 --> 08:40.379
Show some damn respect!

08:40.412 --> 08:43.682
You! Get the fuck out of here!
Right now. God dammit!

08:45.651 --> 08:47.453
Hey, man. I don't have anywhere
to fucking go.

08:47.486 --> 08:48.787
Can you fuck off
somewhere else?

08:48.821 --> 08:50.389
Runnin' a business here.

08:54.827 --> 08:56.462
Fuck.

08:56.495 --> 08:59.732
All right, you guys ready
to get this open mic going?

08:59.765 --> 09:01.934
Yes, that's what
I'm talkin' about.

09:01.967 --> 09:05.938
Explosion! Oh my God,
it's good to be here.

09:05.971 --> 09:07.406
It's good to see you guys, man.

09:07.439 --> 09:08.574
- Yeah!
- Yes,

09:08.607 --> 09:09.909
that's what I'm talking about.

09:09.942 --> 09:11.443
Thank you, let's do... Ah, man,

09:11.477 --> 09:13.479
it's so good to be out
here in North Hollywood, man.

09:13.512 --> 09:15.347
Love North Hollywood.
Not as sexy

09:15.381 --> 09:17.082
as the rest of Los Angeles.

09:17.116 --> 09:18.817
You want to talk
to some hot girls?

09:18.851 --> 09:21.620
Not happening! No hot chicks!

09:21.655 --> 09:23.956
But you want to get
your tires rotated,

09:23.989 --> 09:26.492
we got 75 different
places to choose from,

09:26.525 --> 09:28.928
right here on this
street alone, okay?

09:28.961 --> 09:30.664
You want to meet
some famous people?

09:30.696 --> 09:34.800
Not happening! No famous
people, man. None whatsoever.

09:34.833 --> 09:36.535
But you wanna trade
your car for scrap metal,

09:36.569 --> 09:39.838
we got 175 different
places to choose from

09:39.872 --> 09:42.341
within a two-block
radius. It's beautiful.

09:42.374 --> 09:44.476
Aw man, you want to
get some good food?

09:44.510 --> 09:47.346
- Actually we do have some good food out here. We do.
- Oh!

09:47.379 --> 09:49.848
We do, yeah. As long
as your idea of good food

09:49.882 --> 09:52.451
is an H&R Block
fucking Taco Bell!

09:52.484 --> 09:54.453
Explosion! Yes!

09:54.486 --> 09:56.889
Thank you, guys. I don't
even really have an ending

09:56.922 --> 09:58.490
for that joke yet,
so we're just gonna

09:58.524 --> 09:59.992
get this open mic going, guys.

10:00.025 --> 10:01.994
Oh yeah, let's do this!

10:02.027 --> 10:03.896
Let's welcome to the stage
our first performer.

10:03.929 --> 10:05.965
Coming up here, I love this
guy, you know him, you love him,

10:05.998 --> 10:08.534
the one, the only,
Amir Kalil! Yes!

10:08.567 --> 10:10.569
Amir, get on up here, baby.

10:10.603 --> 10:13.038
- Good to see you.
- Ah, he brought an instrument!

10:20.179 --> 10:22.815
♪ Ooh, yeah, yeah ♪

10:22.848 --> 10:24.583
♪ Wooh hoo hoo ♪

10:24.617 --> 10:27.353
Listen, guys, I'm actually
mixed race

10:27.386 --> 10:29.555
with Black and Arabic,

10:29.588 --> 10:32.057
and it really does
come out in my singing.

10:32.891 --> 10:34.260
This is what it sounds like.

10:34.293 --> 10:37.731
♪ Baby, ooh, yeah ♪

10:39.531 --> 10:42.268
So I grew up the daughter
of a Russian immigrant.

10:42.301 --> 10:45.004
And let me tell you,
she critiqued everything.

10:45.037 --> 10:47.172
Anyways, this one day
I come home from school

10:47.206 --> 10:48.742
and I'm really upset

10:48.774 --> 10:51.210
because this girl has
made up rumors about me.

10:51.243 --> 10:53.612
Anyway, so I go to my
mother and I'm crying,

10:53.647 --> 10:56.248
"Mama, she said, I'm a slut,
she said I'm a whore."

10:56.282 --> 10:59.285
And my mother, she looks at
me and she's really offended.

10:59.318 --> 11:02.054
And she says to me, "Sveta,

11:02.087 --> 11:05.891
why you care who say you slut,
who say you whore?

11:05.924 --> 11:08.560
What matters is I know

11:08.594 --> 11:11.030
you fucking prostitute-ka."

11:11.063 --> 11:14.967
Oh my God, real comedy!

11:15.000 --> 11:17.737
So much better
than the other girl!

11:17.771 --> 11:19.538
Thank you guys all so much.

11:19.571 --> 11:21.040
This is actually
my last show tonight.

11:21.073 --> 11:23.809
I've booked a recurring role
on Improv Tonite.

11:23.842 --> 11:26.278
So I'm gonna have an audience
larger than five people.

11:30.849 --> 11:33.919
Check me out on Instagram!

11:33.952 --> 11:36.288
- Well, I mean, you said three minutes?
- Yeah.

11:36.322 --> 11:37.791
Yeah, we just did five.

11:37.823 --> 11:39.291
Minutes that actually work.

11:39.325 --> 11:41.293
Yeah, we kinda bypass
that, you see this?

11:41.327 --> 11:44.330
- We got all these followers right here.
- Yeah.

11:44.363 --> 11:47.099
Mm, how long did you say
you were doing comedy again?

11:47.132 --> 11:49.468
- Well, we just started like a month...
- Oh, yeah, about a month.

11:49.501 --> 11:52.471
We're models, influencers,
for uh...

11:52.504 --> 11:53.839
honestly, probably the dopest

11:53.872 --> 11:55.407
vegan shaving cream
startup in the city.

11:55.441 --> 11:57.910
- Right, right.
- Yeah, how does that work?

11:57.943 --> 11:59.511
Well, okay, so like,

11:59.545 --> 12:01.180
if you're gonna do a
vegan alternative, right?

12:01.213 --> 12:04.316
You gotta do something that
is both sexy and empowering.

12:04.350 --> 12:05.951
So that's kind of
where we come in.

12:05.984 --> 12:09.421
He brings the empowering,
I bring the sexy.

12:09.455 --> 12:10.522
- Yup.
- Yup.

12:10.556 --> 12:12.124
Oh, how...

12:12.157 --> 12:13.525
Um, I, uh...

12:13.559 --> 12:16.995
I would love to sit
here and talk more...

12:17.029 --> 12:18.130
- Yeah, please do.
- About

12:18.163 --> 12:20.132
the vegan sour cream company...

12:20.165 --> 12:21.433
Shaving cream.

12:21.467 --> 12:23.268
- Sorry...
- That you guys got going.

12:23.302 --> 12:24.536
- It's shaving cream.
- It's shaving cream.

12:24.570 --> 12:26.438
It's a shaving cream company.

12:26.472 --> 12:28.273
- Shaving cream.
- Sorry, I've never heard somebody say that, it's crazy.

12:28.307 --> 12:30.275
Shaving cream company
y'all are putting together,

12:30.309 --> 12:33.780
love to stay here and talk more
about that, but I gotta run.

12:33.813 --> 12:37.883
And Devontae? Aren't you signed
up at Bomb Shelter tonight?

12:37.916 --> 12:39.351
- Fuck.
- Right.

12:39.385 --> 12:41.387
Nice to meet y'all, good
luck with everything.

12:41.420 --> 12:42.521
- Yeah, yeah, yeah...
- Yeah, bye.

12:42.554 --> 12:43.622
- Nicole, right?
- Take care.

12:43.656 --> 12:44.791
- Nelly.
- Nelly?

12:44.824 --> 12:46.693
- Nelly, Nelly.
- Nelly.

12:48.762 --> 12:50.396
What's up with your girl?

12:50.429 --> 12:53.132
It's a tough crowd, but
I feel like she killed it.

12:53.165 --> 12:55.835
No, no. I'm talking about like...
what's good with her, right?

12:55.869 --> 12:57.637
- You know what I'm saying?
- Yeah, no.

12:59.238 --> 13:03.175
All right, guys. Next up,
none of us are actually sure

13:03.208 --> 13:05.812
whether this guy is
really funny or not,

13:05.845 --> 13:07.980
but let's keep it going
for the one, the only,

13:08.013 --> 13:11.818
Griff Frickin' Pippin! Yes!

13:11.851 --> 13:15.254
Just a bunch of motherfuckers
tellin' some truth!

13:15.287 --> 13:16.522
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

13:16.555 --> 13:18.223
Yeah! Woo!

13:18.257 --> 13:21.093
You know what I hate?
you know what fucking sucks?

13:21.126 --> 13:23.529
Car... Car insurance, Goddammit.

13:23.562 --> 13:25.698
I fucking hate it. They bend
you right over

13:25.732 --> 13:27.566
and they fuck you in the ass!

13:27.599 --> 13:28.934
And you know what?

13:28.967 --> 13:30.870
You don't even have
to have car insurance.

13:30.904 --> 13:32.404
Do you know that?

13:32.438 --> 13:35.174
You could just drive around
without car insurance.

13:35.207 --> 13:37.844
You could drive around. As long
as you take care of yourself,

13:37.877 --> 13:40.345
you don't have to fucking
have car insurance.

13:40.379 --> 13:43.683
So, fuck all of you.
Have a good night!

13:43.716 --> 13:46.786
Next up, the only one of
us actually making a living

13:46.820 --> 13:48.620
off of comedy right now, no...

13:48.655 --> 13:51.557
- Fuck!
- Yeah, maybe next year, Pippin.

13:51.590 --> 13:54.059
All right, not even sure why
this guy still comes here,

13:54.092 --> 13:55.427
but it's always great
to have the him.

13:55.461 --> 13:57.697
The one, the only,
Dante Chang, guys.

13:57.730 --> 14:00.199
- Yeah!
- Dante Chang, what's goin' on, baby?

14:00.232 --> 14:03.736
Holy shit, that's the biggest catfish I've ever seen.

14:03.770 --> 14:06.572
Griff, shut the
fuck up. You know why?

14:06.605 --> 14:10.242
Because... You know...
You're a white man from the waist up,

14:10.275 --> 14:13.612
but you're a black woman from the waist down.

14:13.646 --> 14:15.715
People say the most racist
things to me, you know?

14:15.748 --> 14:16.950
Other day, dude was like,

14:16.982 --> 14:19.618
"Do your people really
eat dog and shit?"

14:19.652 --> 14:21.721
It's messed up. Whenever
I go to my friend's house,

14:21.754 --> 14:23.890
they hide their dog and shit.

14:23.923 --> 14:26.425
You can hear it scratching

14:26.458 --> 14:28.293
It's like, "Hey
man, you got a dog?"

14:28.327 --> 14:31.597
"No, dude, I don't know what
the fuck you're talking about."

14:31.631 --> 14:32.932
Then it barks, "Woof!"

14:32.966 --> 14:34.132
"You do have a dog.

14:34.166 --> 14:36.568
It's okay, man, I got
a dog too."

14:36.602 --> 14:39.104
They're like, "Is
it in your freezer?"

14:39.137 --> 14:42.307
Like, "No, man,
it's in the oven."

14:44.343 --> 14:46.311
So this is where
you go where...

14:46.345 --> 14:48.815
you're good, or...
you just getting started?

14:48.848 --> 14:50.750
I think it's where you
come when you, like really...

14:50.783 --> 14:52.184
When you want to...
Get in for this.

14:52.217 --> 14:53.753
When you want to sit
aggressively close to people,

14:53.786 --> 14:55.320
this is where you come.

14:55.354 --> 14:56.555
Say that again?

14:58.290 --> 15:00.092
Could you say
that one more time?

15:00.559 --> 15:01.694
Forget it.

15:01.728 --> 15:04.029
Next up, you know
him, you love him,

15:04.062 --> 15:05.932
the one, the only...

15:05.965 --> 15:08.133
- He goes by Just Kyle, guys. Give it up...
- For real?

15:08.166 --> 15:10.703
- Yes, Kyle. Kyle, get up here.
- What the fuck...

15:10.737 --> 15:12.471
- Aw, what the fuck?
- This sucks!

15:12.504 --> 15:16.643
So I visited my grandma
the other day, and...

15:16.676 --> 15:18.711
You know, she's always
criticizing me.

15:18.745 --> 15:22.147
She was like, "Kyle,
your shoes are dirty.

15:22.180 --> 15:24.216
Kyle, your shirt is wrinkled.

15:24.249 --> 15:27.020
Maybe you should
iron more often."

15:27.052 --> 15:28.554
And I told her like,

15:28.587 --> 15:31.290
"Grandma, you need to iron
your face."

15:32.025 --> 15:33.258
Wow!

15:37.897 --> 15:40.332
What, you guys don't...
Don't have grandmas?

15:40.365 --> 15:42.301
This guy looks
like a fucking programmer

15:42.334 --> 15:43.803
that just did a bunch of meth.

15:43.836 --> 15:45.672
I may look like I do meth,

15:45.705 --> 15:47.840
but I'm definitely
not a programmer.

15:47.874 --> 15:51.476
Next up, we got the one, the
only, Devontae Green, everybody!

15:53.245 --> 15:55.213
Jesus Christ, <i>agai</i>?

15:55.247 --> 15:57.082
Goddamn, man.

15:57.115 --> 16:00.152
Well, there goes our only full
black comic of the night, guys.

16:00.185 --> 16:03.756
So, she really comes
here and does comedy...

16:04.791 --> 16:06.358
- The mic...
- She's supposed to be funny,

16:06.391 --> 16:07.961
-Yep. Well, yeah.

16:09.261 --> 16:12.564
There's differences of opinion
of what funny is.

16:12.598 --> 16:14.600
I... For instance, I saw
somebody...

16:14.634 --> 16:16.535
Some... Someone clapped
during your routine.

16:16.568 --> 16:18.604
Nah, that's like saying
that you don't see color.

16:26.746 --> 16:28.180
Hey, man.

16:28.213 --> 16:31.084
That was the most metal shit
I've ever fucking seen.

16:31.116 --> 16:33.886
Creepy van guy!
Ah, you're still here.

16:33.920 --> 16:36.055
Dude, can you just give me
the night to figure out my van

16:36.089 --> 16:37.924
- and I'll be gone in the morning?
- Hard pass.

16:37.957 --> 16:40.059
Place of business. Can't run
a hotel on the side.

16:40.093 --> 16:41.794
Dude, look, I'm just...

16:41.828 --> 16:43.930
I'm just looking for a little
fucking understanding.

16:43.963 --> 16:45.430
Dude, if I let you stay here,

16:45.464 --> 16:47.199
then every comic in Los Angeles
is gonna be like,

16:47.232 --> 16:49.234
"Oh, hey Dave, why can't
I just stay there too

16:49.267 --> 16:51.904
- like that one guy does?"
- Dude, this isn't the fucking Ritz Carlton, man.

16:51.938 --> 16:53.072
I think you're okay.

16:53.106 --> 16:55.240
If your van isn't gone
by lockup,

16:55.273 --> 16:56.776
I'm going to have
your van towed.

16:56.809 --> 16:58.543
I shoulda let that
fucking hillbilly

16:58.577 --> 17:00.046
pick his fucking teeth with you.

17:00.079 --> 17:03.049
Running a business ain't
for the tenderhearted.

17:03.082 --> 17:05.985
How fucking tenderhearted do you
think the cops would be if...

17:06.019 --> 17:10.489
I don't know, they saw
the one, two, three, uh...

17:10.522 --> 17:12.257
Just those fire hazards
I can see

17:12.290 --> 17:13.425
off the top of my fucking head?

17:13.458 --> 17:15.728
All right. What do you want?

17:15.762 --> 17:17.063
Let me fix 'em.

17:17.930 --> 17:18.965
For?

17:18.998 --> 17:20.165
Dude.

17:20.198 --> 17:21.400
I'm not as dumb
as I fucking look.

17:21.433 --> 17:22.902
Let me... Let me fix
the place up.

17:22.935 --> 17:25.270
Just give me like a week
or two <i>tops</i>

17:25.303 --> 17:26.973
to figure out my van shit.

17:27.006 --> 17:29.008
This place will be better,
and you won't even know I'm here.

17:32.812 --> 17:35.180
- Okay.
- Oh, man! Really?

17:35.213 --> 17:37.016
No! Oh, my God!

17:37.050 --> 17:39.317
Bro, I, unlike you,
have landlords.

17:39.351 --> 17:41.120
- I share this lot with other businesses...
- Oh, God!

17:41.154 --> 17:42.587
And... and...

17:42.621 --> 17:44.623
Yeah, I know. You'll fucking
tow me if I'm not gone.

17:44.657 --> 17:45.992
Ding-ding-ding-ding-ding, bam!

17:46.025 --> 17:48.828
Explosion! Yes, you've got it!

17:50.029 --> 17:51.563
Ah, my God.

17:53.498 --> 17:55.134
Fuck.

17:58.805 --> 18:00.773
Hey. Um...

18:01.506 --> 18:03.910
Yeah. It's me. Uh...

18:05.310 --> 18:07.947
I'm not doing so hot
right now, and um...

18:07.980 --> 18:10.116
can I crash at your place?

18:10.149 --> 18:12.652
Hang up the phone!

18:13.853 --> 18:15.888
- Hey, can I call you back?
- God...

18:15.922 --> 18:19.025
You were just groveling.

18:19.058 --> 18:20.660
Don't you understand?

18:20.693 --> 18:24.296
If you go back to her now,
she freaking owns you, man!

18:24.329 --> 18:26.199
I don't see... What other
options do I have?

18:26.231 --> 18:28.801
I can't let...

18:28.835 --> 18:32.872
another man...
become... a bitch.

18:32.905 --> 18:35.675
This society... does nothing...

18:35.708 --> 18:39.611
but try to say every ounce of
masculinity that we have away from us.

18:39.645 --> 18:42.815
We are men. We do men shit.

18:42.849 --> 18:46.585
You will not go crawling
back to that woman.

18:46.618 --> 18:48.320
God! Dang it!

18:48.353 --> 18:51.523
- I won't?
- No! She broke your heart.

18:51.556 --> 18:53.192
Didn't call you for months,

18:53.226 --> 18:55.228
lied about her
parents liking you

18:55.260 --> 18:57.329
when you knew that
they hated you. Despite the fact

18:57.362 --> 18:59.364
that you complemented
their roast chicken,

18:59.397 --> 19:02.168
which tastes like burnt pubes!

19:09.474 --> 19:11.543
- You can fix the place up, okay?
- Ahhh!

19:11.576 --> 19:14.914
Just promise me you won't
go crawling back to her.

19:14.947 --> 19:19.584
She's the woman. <i>She</i> comes
crawling back to <i>yo</i>, the man.

19:19.618 --> 19:22.188
- This is man time.
- Yeah.

19:22.221 --> 19:24.090
- Man time.
- Right.

19:24.123 --> 19:25.457
- Man time!
- Yeah, got it.

19:25.490 --> 19:26.793
- Man time!
- Yeah, cool.

19:26.826 --> 19:28.060
Man! Say it!

19:28.094 --> 19:30.229
- Man time, man time.
- Man time, man time.

19:30.263 --> 19:32.265
Okay, yes. I feel like...

19:32.297 --> 19:34.466
Yes, whatever you say. I feel
like a lot of that wasn't...

19:34.499 --> 19:36.002
- Direc... Directed at me, and...
- Good.

19:36.803 --> 19:39.404
kind of sounded like a 1950s
marriage counselor,

19:39.437 --> 19:42.440
but yes. Yes.
Yes, anything. I'm...

19:42.474 --> 19:44.543
- Thank you. I will not let you down.
- Good...

19:44.576 --> 19:46.646
- Whatever you need. I'm here.
- You gotta couple of weeks.

19:46.679 --> 19:48.114
Okay, yeah.

19:48.147 --> 19:49.882
- All right, last thing.
- Yeah?

19:49.916 --> 19:52.084
No dick fucking around.
This is a place of business.

19:52.118 --> 19:53.719
Okay. Done.

19:55.320 --> 19:56.555
Ahh.

20:02.594 --> 20:05.497
Oh, what the fuck?

20:05.530 --> 20:07.200
Did that just fuck...

20:08.134 --> 20:10.903
Those are my
clean fucking socks.

20:10.937 --> 20:12.305
God damn it!

20:15.942 --> 20:17.243
Hey, yo. My dude, uh...

20:17.276 --> 20:19.312
You really think that this
is the, uh...

20:19.377 --> 20:21.914
the best spot for you to have
your little...

20:21.948 --> 20:23.515
uh, nervous breakdown?

20:23.548 --> 20:27.653
Ah... Just doing some spring
cleaning on my home, so.

20:29.956 --> 20:31.523
You one of them white people
where the...

20:31.556 --> 20:33.659
the privilege just kinda
passed right over you, huh?

20:33.693 --> 20:36.796
Passed right over my whole
fucking state.

20:36.829 --> 20:39.598
I'm just getting like a...
Arby's roast beef...

20:39.632 --> 20:41.000
- vibe, yeah. Yeah.
- Yeah.

20:41.033 --> 20:42.434
Okay, cool. Yeah.

20:42.467 --> 20:45.638
Yeah. I'm... Well, I'm...
I'm Arnold.

20:45.671 --> 20:47.606
I uh... live here.

20:48.506 --> 20:49.709
What about you?

20:50.910 --> 20:52.678
Um... Devontae.

20:52.712 --> 20:54.747
- You live here, like, permanently, or?
- Yeah.

20:56.349 --> 21:00.219
Well, me and my girl
kinda of... Are going through it.

21:00.253 --> 21:02.520
So it's just, uh...

21:02.554 --> 21:04.891
me and the Mystery Machine...

21:04.924 --> 21:06.491
right here. Oh! Uh...

21:06.524 --> 21:10.096
Jacuzzi's going in right
there, so just... Yeah, thanks.

21:10.830 --> 21:12.965
Let me just... I'll make sure...

21:12.999 --> 21:15.201
Yeah, that's a good
spot too. Actually.

21:15.234 --> 21:17.502
You know, usually when you
go from living together

21:17.535 --> 21:20.640
to living in a van, that's
called a breakup, my dude.

21:21.240 --> 21:23.743
But you know, you never know.

21:23.776 --> 21:25.645
What's uh... What's your story?

21:26.879 --> 21:29.581
I moved out here two
years ago from high school.

21:29.614 --> 21:31.050
- Nice.
- Yeah.

21:31.751 --> 21:33.352
Yeah. You a comic?

21:33.386 --> 21:37.056
Nah. Yeah...
I mean... I moved here to...

21:37.890 --> 21:41.193
to at least... try it.
Baby steps.

21:41.227 --> 21:43.029
Devontae!
As I live and breathe.

21:43.062 --> 21:45.097
Thanks for actually
showing up this time.

21:45.131 --> 21:47.166
Shit. All right,
I'ma have to hit you later.

21:47.199 --> 21:48.600
- Yeah?
- Uh, yeah.

21:48.634 --> 21:50.535
Yeah. I gotta get
back on Dave's good side.

21:50.568 --> 21:52.238
- Yeah.
- All right, I'll see you.

21:52.271 --> 21:55.908
Yeah. Oh, uh... Well,
a Waka Flocka Flame to you, sir.

21:55.942 --> 22:00.146
As Ice Cube says,
"I hope you have a good day."

22:01.814 --> 22:03.548
All right, so I'ma jump right
into it, uh,

22:03.581 --> 22:06.551
'cause, uh, no one else
has addressed it yet. Um...

22:06.584 --> 22:08.754
I'll... I'll talk about the dude
in the van.

22:08.788 --> 22:10.256
There's a dude...

22:10.289 --> 22:12.725
There's a... There's a dude
in the van right outside.

22:12.758 --> 22:15.895
Yeah I don't know if anybody had
the pleasure of talking to him.

22:15.928 --> 22:18.931
He's... He's a cool dude.
He seems like a cool-ass dude.

22:18.965 --> 22:20.565
He's going through a breakup.

22:20.598 --> 22:22.534
He doesn't know that yet,
but he's going through it.

22:22.567 --> 22:26.105
He's... He's gonna figure that
part out, you know. Um...

22:26.138 --> 22:28.107
The... What I really
like about him is that clearly,

22:28.140 --> 22:30.575
he likes to date women of color.

22:30.608 --> 22:32.645
'Cause, know what I'm saying, though?
He was definitely dating a sister

22:32.678 --> 22:34.413
that put him out who put them
out in that motherfucking van

22:34.447 --> 22:36.415
right out... outside of this
place?

22:36.449 --> 22:39.051
She probably made sure he
ended up at this place too.

22:44.657 --> 22:46.258
Yo, van guy!

22:46.292 --> 22:47.994
We all noticed you're
about a half a step away

22:48.027 --> 22:49.428
from losing your fucking mind
out here.

22:49.462 --> 22:51.297
Why don't you come
check out a show?

22:51.330 --> 22:52.765
You just did a bunch
of shows, man.

22:52.798 --> 22:54.266
No, those are mics.

22:54.300 --> 22:57.303
I'm talking about a real
show with real people.

22:57.336 --> 22:58.637
Aren't you real people?

22:58.671 --> 23:00.605
Comics aren't real people,
you idiot.

23:00.639 --> 23:02.274
We're barely even human,
all right?

23:02.308 --> 23:03.943
Have you seen our bathroom?

23:03.976 --> 23:05.778
I mean, come on, have you
talked to Griff Pippin?

23:05.811 --> 23:07.279
The guy's a fucking nut job.

23:07.313 --> 23:09.348
It'll ease your mind.
Just come on. Come with...

23:09.382 --> 23:10.750
Trust me. Come with me.

23:13.486 --> 23:15.221
All right. Fuck it.

23:17.189 --> 23:19.557
There you go. Nicely done.

23:20.059 --> 23:21.559
- Jesus Christ.
- Ow.

23:22.828 --> 23:24.497
My God, bro.

23:24.529 --> 23:26.866
She fucked you up. There you...
Oh, very good.

23:26.899 --> 23:29.368
Yeah, you wouldn't want anyone
to drive your immobile home away.

23:29.402 --> 23:30.770

23:53.426 --> 23:55.327
We having a good time
tonight guys?

23:55.361 --> 23:58.397
Let me hear ya!

23:58.431 --> 23:59.865
But...

23:59.899 --> 24:02.701
We have reached
a point... in the night...

24:03.601 --> 24:05.237
This is the time...

24:05.271 --> 24:06.571
of the show that I've been
looking forward...

24:06.604 --> 24:08.040
It's my favorite
part of the show

24:08.074 --> 24:10.042
because there have been
too many sex machines

24:10.076 --> 24:12.678
making it look
freaking easy up here.

24:12.711 --> 24:16.549
And I can assure you guys,
it is not as easy as it looks.

24:16.581 --> 24:17.883
- Okay.
- And that is why

24:17.917 --> 24:20.386
we do this at this show.
We are about to engage

24:20.419 --> 24:22.655
in my favorite ritual
in all of comedy,

24:22.688 --> 24:24.890
the virgin sacrifice!

24:26.425 --> 24:30.896
Virgin! Virgin!
Virgin! Virgin! Virgin...

24:31.097 --> 24:32.698
Silence!

24:32.731 --> 24:34.599
Is there one among you...

24:34.633 --> 24:35.935
who has the guts to come up here

24:35.968 --> 24:39.004
and sacrifice yourself
for this audience here?

24:39.038 --> 24:41.707
- Is there not one among you?
- I'll do it.

24:41.740 --> 24:43.242
- Oh!
- I'll fucking do it!

24:43.275 --> 24:46.745
We have our virgin right here!
Get up here!

24:47.246 --> 24:49.715
Oh, man. Woo!

24:49.748 --> 24:52.251
All right, what is your name?

24:53.786 --> 24:55.221
Chet.

24:55.254 --> 24:56.822
Chet what?

24:57.723 --> 24:59.792
Just Chet, bro!

24:59.825 --> 25:01.961
All right, guys. Give it up,

25:01.994 --> 25:05.464
keep it going for just Chet!

25:05.498 --> 25:09.034
Oh, my God! Oh my...

25:09.068 --> 25:10.636
Ohhh!

25:10.669 --> 25:12.037
Oh!

25:12.071 --> 25:15.341
I... love...
fucking bitches!

25:18.444 --> 25:20.980
Oh. All right.

25:21.013 --> 25:24.216
Well I guess I'll tell you this
one story. Uh...

25:25.017 --> 25:27.987
So this one time, uh,
I was at a club,

25:28.020 --> 25:30.356
and, like, the bouncer...

25:31.790 --> 25:34.960
would not, like,
let us in and shit.

25:34.994 --> 25:38.063
And I was like, "Bro,
why aren't you letting us in?

25:38.097 --> 25:40.499
We're fucking
fly and shit, man!"

25:42.034 --> 25:43.736
Uh, what?

25:44.803 --> 25:46.640
- Okay.
- Who is this guy?

25:46.672 --> 25:48.574
Fine. All right.

25:50.476 --> 25:52.745
I guess you had to be there.

25:52.778 --> 25:54.146
I'm fucking Chet!

25:54.180 --> 25:56.515
Yeah!
That wasn't comedy!

25:57.850 --> 25:58.951
- Look!
- Huh?

25:58.984 --> 26:00.085
- Eggs!
- What?

26:00.119 --> 26:01.287
Breakfast is served.

26:01.320 --> 26:03.155
You think this...
hardened comportment

26:03.189 --> 26:04.690
that you see here
was always like this?

26:04.723 --> 26:06.825
No, sir, I've been
in the fire brother.

26:06.859 --> 26:08.327
Gotta pull yourself out.

26:08.360 --> 26:11.330
Set goals, plans, frickin'
make shit happen, man.

26:11.363 --> 26:12.831
Yeah, where I'm from,
we really don't

26:12.865 --> 26:14.433
- do that shit.
- Well, you're not in Dayton anymore.

26:14.466 --> 26:16.335
You're right here. Casa de Dave.

26:16.368 --> 26:17.870
Come on, what are you gonna do?

26:17.903 --> 26:19.639
All right. All right! Um...

26:19.673 --> 26:21.774
My van's fucked, I gotta fix it.

26:21.807 --> 26:23.342
- Good start, yes.
- Okay.

26:23.375 --> 26:25.844
All right, after that,
you're going to?

26:25.878 --> 26:27.813
I guess I can give
comedy a real try.

26:27.846 --> 26:30.149
There you go, you're
gettin' fuckin' hard!

26:30.182 --> 26:32.652
You're trying standup.
What else? What's after that?

26:32.686 --> 26:35.321
I guess when Mary sees
how good I'm fuckin' doing,

26:35.354 --> 26:36.822
she'll have to get
back together with me.

26:36.855 --> 26:39.458
She might! She might, bro.
You'll have a chance.

26:39.491 --> 26:41.327
It's better than fucking
what you're doing now.

26:41.360 --> 26:43.529
- Well, yeah.
- Okay?

26:43.562 --> 26:46.899
All right. That's a start.
Step one, finished.

26:46.932 --> 26:48.668
I got a bunch of
tools in my shed too.

26:48.702 --> 26:51.437
It might have everything
you need. Fucking boom, man!

26:56.842 --> 26:58.077
How...

26:58.944 --> 27:01.213
How are you, like...

27:02.281 --> 27:04.984
The way... you are?

27:05.017 --> 27:06.585
Did you put fucking
meth in those eggs?

27:06.619 --> 27:08.887
No. I can smell a fire
in you, kid!

27:08.921 --> 27:10.389
The fucking veins.

27:10.422 --> 27:12.224
It's not a raging fire,
it's more of a fat, lazy ember.

27:12.258 --> 27:14.994
But, you gotta be in a real
pile of shit

27:15.027 --> 27:16.595
to want to live at The Bomb
Shelter.

27:18.530 --> 27:20.866
Fuck! Come on.
Come on.

27:20.899 --> 27:23.168
You're right there, baby.
Come for me.

27:23.202 --> 27:25.004
Fucking come for me.

27:25.904 --> 27:27.539
Fucking come for...

27:27.573 --> 27:30.776
me!

27:30.809 --> 27:34.380
Oh, mwah! Valhalla,
you smile upon me.

27:34.413 --> 27:37.016
Oh! Oh!

27:37.049 --> 27:41.086
No! No, no, no, nooo!

27:42.054 --> 27:43.989
Hey, you got your house
working yet?

27:44.590 --> 27:46.525
Yeah, I didn't
think it was possible,

27:46.558 --> 27:47.893
but you may actually
be decreasing

27:47.926 --> 27:49.461
the property value here, bro.

27:49.495 --> 27:51.196
You should do anything else.

27:51.230 --> 27:53.599
- Hey, yo, do a set.
- Yeah, thanks, man.

27:53.633 --> 27:56.435
Fucking working standup isn't my
number one priority right now.

27:56.468 --> 27:58.804
Bullshit. You look
like the type, bro.

27:58.837 --> 28:00.105
The fuck does that mean?

28:00.139 --> 28:01.540
That means that you
a little bitch.

28:01.573 --> 28:03.075
Two minutes!

28:03.108 --> 28:05.577
Two fucking minutes, Devontae!

28:05.611 --> 28:06.812
Dave, I'm right here.

28:06.845 --> 28:08.748
I wasn't born yesterday,
I know time seems

28:08.782 --> 28:10.916
to move a little bit
slower when you're high.

28:10.949 --> 28:13.485
Yeah, that's right, two minutes!

28:13.519 --> 28:14.586
Why did you come here?

28:14.620 --> 28:17.556
To be a writer,
actor, or a pussy?

28:17.589 --> 28:19.325
Because you're
acting like a pussy.

28:19.358 --> 28:20.727
Actually, fucking comedy.

28:20.760 --> 28:22.561
Bullshit, bro. What are you
waiting for?

28:22.594 --> 28:24.196
Why don't you fucking
try being homeless?

28:24.229 --> 28:27.299
Another excuse, bro.
You're <i>just</i> like your van.

28:27.333 --> 28:30.770
You're fat, taking
up space, useless...

28:30.804 --> 28:32.237
what the fuck are you doing?

28:32.271 --> 28:33.673
I mean, there's an open spot
for this hour.

28:33.707 --> 28:35.140
Cool, why don't you fucking
show me how then?

28:35.174 --> 28:36.909
You want me to fucking show you?

28:36.942 --> 28:38.778
- Fucking show me.
- I got it.

28:38.812 --> 28:40.245
- Real easy.
- Yeah?

28:40.279 --> 28:41.980
Yeah, real easy, real simple.

28:42.014 --> 28:43.683
- Just put in your name right there.
- There?

28:43.717 --> 28:45.284
Yeah, right there.
you just put your name...

28:45.317 --> 28:47.186
- And then give him the five bucks?
- Yeah, that's it.

28:47.219 --> 28:48.954
All right, fuck it.

28:48.987 --> 28:50.422
- He's in.
- That's cool.

28:50.456 --> 28:51.957
If you don't
have cash, Venmo's cool too.

28:51.990 --> 28:53.459
Like, he'll take
whatever, you know?

28:53.492 --> 28:54.828
Coming to this
stage right now,

28:54.860 --> 28:57.863
doing his first-ever
standup of his life! Yes!

28:57.896 --> 28:59.164
You know him, you love him,

28:59.198 --> 29:01.200
he's our very own Bomb Shelter
mascot,

29:01.233 --> 29:04.637
Arnold, everybody! Get up here, Arnold.

29:04.671 --> 29:06.271
Oh, wow!

29:06.305 --> 29:11.009
Ellen Degenerates looks terrible
in real life. Holy Christ!

29:12.746 --> 29:14.980
- Uh, I am Arnold.
- Sup?

29:15.013 --> 29:17.950
I am the, uh...
local van dweller.

29:17.983 --> 29:20.452
Um...

29:20.486 --> 29:21.721
Yeah.

29:22.521 --> 29:24.490
Uhhh...

29:27.660 --> 29:31.897
- I'm from Dayton, Ohio. Uh...
- Yeah, we can tell.

29:31.930 --> 29:36.034
Yeah, which is
dominantly white people. Um...

29:36.770 --> 29:38.638
There was, like in my
high school,

29:38.671 --> 29:41.974
like a couple Asian guys and,
like, one half Black person.

29:42.007 --> 29:43.208
They were a midget.

29:43.242 --> 29:45.645
- Cool, man.
- Oh, great joke.

29:49.081 --> 29:51.917
When I moved to LA, uh...

29:51.950 --> 29:54.253
I moved to K-Town. Um...

29:55.254 --> 29:57.156
and every time I met
someone, I would say,

29:57.189 --> 29:58.323
"Oh, where are you from?"

29:58.357 --> 30:00.159
And they'd say, "South Korea."

30:00.192 --> 30:03.262
I would say, "Is that the
good one or the bad one?"

30:03.295 --> 30:06.231
- Swing and a miss.
- Nice one, dude.

30:06.265 --> 30:10.502
Wow, this guy's just given
up on life <i>and</i> he's not funny.

30:11.103 --> 30:13.505
So yeah. Uh...

30:13.539 --> 30:16.074
when I moved here,
I moved here, uh,

30:16.108 --> 30:18.678
- to uh, Los Feliz.
- Hot garbage fire.

30:18.711 --> 30:20.914
Where I met, um, a girl

30:20.979 --> 30:22.882
who was from Mexico and we...

30:22.916 --> 30:24.383
I bet you did, big guy.

30:24.416 --> 30:26.185
We started dating,
and we moved in and I just...

30:26.218 --> 30:27.754
Yeah. Yeah.

30:27.787 --> 30:29.588
- I always assumed that...
- Lived with the parents?

30:29.621 --> 30:32.257
- Yeah, you did...
- That she would just wanna...

30:32.291 --> 30:35.360
Hey, Ron Weasley? Don't you
have to go to fucking Hogwarts

30:35.394 --> 30:37.029
and shoot that shit
up or something?

30:38.230 --> 30:39.799
- Fuck.
- He lives!

30:39.833 --> 30:41.300
The guy lives!

30:41.333 --> 30:42.802
Surprisingly not horrible.

30:42.836 --> 30:45.971
Surprisingly not
horrible, all right?

30:46.004 --> 30:48.540
Uh, everybody put your hands
together for...

30:48.574 --> 30:50.910
the very funny, the very lovely
Nelly Taskin, guys.

30:53.312 --> 30:55.414
Good evening, motherfuckers.

30:55.447 --> 30:57.650
I'm just so privileged
to be here.

30:57.684 --> 31:00.419
Part of this all-male room, huh?

31:00.452 --> 31:02.655
No women at all.

31:03.322 --> 31:05.491
Listen, I know a
lot of you in here,

31:05.524 --> 31:08.126
you hate women. And you think
just 'cause I'm dumb enough

31:08.160 --> 31:10.763
to hang out with
you, I hate them too.

31:10.797 --> 31:13.733
Nah. No. I don't hate women.

31:14.868 --> 31:15.935
I just hate skinny women.

31:15.969 --> 31:17.837
- Oh! Ha haa!
- Oww!

31:17.871 --> 31:19.906
Yep, thank you.

31:19.939 --> 31:21.006
And pretty women, all right?

31:21.039 --> 31:22.608
- Fuck off!
- Fuck me!

31:22.642 --> 31:24.944
Oh, I left my key.
Yeah, I did. I left it there.

31:24.978 --> 31:27.279
Yeah, can you bring it?
Oh, you pullin' up right now?

31:27.312 --> 31:29.849
Oh, okay. I see you.
All right, babe.

31:30.817 --> 31:33.018
You know, sometimes I hate
how much of an asshole you are,

31:33.051 --> 31:35.788
but it feels so good knowing
who really wears the pants.

31:38.056 --> 31:40.526
Shit, I'm the
one who tells

31:40.559 --> 31:42.662
her when to sit and to pee,
you know what I'm saying?

31:42.695 --> 31:43.830
- Ew.
- Yeah, okay.

31:43.863 --> 31:45.364
- Huh?
- You heard me.

31:45.397 --> 31:47.000
That's another
weird thing to say.

31:47.032 --> 31:48.500
Hey sweetie!

31:48.534 --> 31:50.637
- Hey, Katherine.
- Hey, Kat.

31:50.670 --> 31:52.972
Hi losers. Haven't seen
you guys in what, two days?

31:53.006 --> 31:54.674
We're going
to Oyster Lounge. You comin'?

31:54.707 --> 31:56.676
Mmm, no thanks. As much
fun as it actually sounds

31:56.709 --> 31:58.811
I would rather not watch you
talk trash about me on stage.

31:58.845 --> 32:00.546
You should be used to it by now.

32:00.579 --> 32:01.748
No.

32:03.816 --> 32:05.350
Aw, that was cute.

32:06.251 --> 32:07.787
One minute.

32:07.820 --> 32:09.856
If you're the first
black guy somebody meets,

32:09.889 --> 32:11.390
they're definitely
gonna be racist.

32:11.423 --> 32:13.993
You literally check off
all the boxes, my friend.

32:14.027 --> 32:17.062
Well, at least my
boxes gettin' checked.

32:18.031 --> 32:19.197
I hope that's not
part of your act.

32:19.231 --> 32:20.599
- It might be.
- That's not funny.

32:22.669 --> 32:24.971
- That was kind of funny.
- Are you hungry?

32:25.004 --> 32:26.973
Well, thinking about grabbing
some food from 7-Eleven.

32:27.006 --> 32:28.407
Ah, no. Negative.

32:28.440 --> 32:30.977
Let's eat some real food
at Oyster Lounge.

32:31.010 --> 32:32.912
There, you could
see a real show.

32:32.946 --> 32:35.480

33:24.329 --> 33:25.898
Yeah, it's 'cause I farted.

33:25.932 --> 33:28.034
Takes a bit of strategy
to get the room back.

33:28.067 --> 33:29.401
- Really?
- Yeah.

33:29.434 --> 33:31.370
I feel like I did that today,
didn't I?

33:31.403 --> 33:33.072
- I felt like I was okay.
- Okay, relax.

33:33.106 --> 33:34.774
- Getting laughs your first time
- No, you were trash.

33:34.807 --> 33:35.942
happens a lot more
than you think.

33:35.975 --> 33:37.877
Try doing that 1000 times more.

33:37.910 --> 33:39.812
First time I went up,
I actually slaughtered.

33:39.846 --> 33:41.748
I was feeling good and all
that shit too, you know?

33:41.781 --> 33:43.883
But next five times I go up?

33:43.916 --> 33:45.985
Bro, I ate dick after dick
for weeks, yo.

33:46.019 --> 33:48.988
Yup, them king-sized dicks,
you know...

33:49.022 --> 33:51.423
Hey, wait. Hold up, they
weren't no king-sized dicks.

33:51.456 --> 33:53.225
I got some laughs, okay?

33:53.258 --> 33:55.762
They was like...
like Kyle-sized dicks.

33:55.795 --> 33:58.064
Burn!

34:01.433 --> 34:03.102
Who the fuck is gonna
follow that?

34:03.136 --> 34:04.603
You? You? You?

34:04.637 --> 34:06.105
- Bro...
- You're not very good.

34:06.139 --> 34:07.774
Bro, you couldn't
follow my B material.

34:07.807 --> 34:09.441
The waitress could
follow your material, Kyle.

34:09.474 --> 34:10.810
You're garbage.

34:10.843 --> 34:12.845
Wait. Amir, did we miss
your set?

34:12.879 --> 34:14.446
Amir is headlining.

34:14.479 --> 34:16.448
You think 'cause I hang out
with your van-dwelling ass,

34:16.481 --> 34:17.950
I don't run shit?

34:17.984 --> 34:19.752
You don't run shit, Amir.

34:19.786 --> 34:22.621
- Not here, and definitely not at home.
- That's facts.

34:22.655 --> 34:25.692
You know what we call
a turtle, in Londers, bruv?

34:25.725 --> 34:27.292
You know what we call
a turtle there?

34:27.325 --> 34:30.129
We... We call it a hardback.

34:30.163 --> 34:31.430
Jesus.

34:32.131 --> 34:33.398
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

34:34.634 --> 34:36.468
Hey, I got to go see
a girl about that butt,

34:36.501 --> 34:38.004
you know what I'm saying?

34:38.037 --> 34:41.473
Hey, yo. Hold my shit,
Goldie Locks.

34:41.506 --> 34:45.210
Hey! Don't you want Amiracle,
baby?

34:46.478 --> 34:48.848
Man, that dude has no game.

34:48.881 --> 34:50.817
Wait, does he really
cheat on his wife?

34:50.850 --> 34:52.551
- No.
- He tries, he fails.

34:52.584 --> 34:54.187
Dude, he's so lame...

34:54.219 --> 34:56.989
He be getting banned for that
shit. From all the clubs.

34:57.023 --> 34:59.025
- Wow.
- Yeah, clubs you can't book.

34:59.058 --> 35:01.894
Hey, my potential is like...
unlimited.

35:01.928 --> 35:03.395
- What are you talking about?
- It's totally true.

35:03.428 --> 35:05.031
You know what's not good?
That's shirt he's wearing.

35:05.064 --> 35:06.231
- Yeah, that shirt sucks.
- It's terrible.

35:06.264 --> 35:07.734
It's not a good shirt.

35:07.767 --> 35:09.736
Who picked... Who picked that
for you?

35:09.769 --> 35:11.303
Did you pick that out?

35:11.336 --> 35:13.706
Did you honestly go to Ross
and looked at the shirts

35:13.740 --> 35:15.742
and were like,
"This is the one"?

35:15.775 --> 35:17.744
I actually got this
at a Kmart back home.

35:17.777 --> 35:19.846
Nah, I think he to his
mother's house

35:19.879 --> 35:22.148
and got the tablecloth and cut
that son of a bitch up, huh?

35:22.181 --> 35:23.916
- Yeah, that's what he did.
- I'm sorry dude.

35:23.950 --> 35:25.383
Why can't you be mean
and funny?

35:25.417 --> 35:27.754
- You're just mean.
- Yeah, you are just mean.

35:27.787 --> 35:30.555
Why can't you be skinny?

35:52.310 --> 35:53.512
Ah.

35:54.113 --> 35:56.348
The last two tenants were
heavy hitters.

35:56.381 --> 35:58.251
I'm not sure this is a good
location for you.

35:58.283 --> 36:01.620
I mean, I have clients who own
casinos who want this space.

36:01.654 --> 36:04.090
Cyrus, if I'm so unqualified,

36:04.123 --> 36:05.792
then why'd you even
call me down here?

36:05.825 --> 36:07.126
Look, if I wanted to sell
the space,

36:07.160 --> 36:09.061
I could do it like this today.

36:09.095 --> 36:10.763
I just want you to show me that
you can run

36:10.797 --> 36:12.732
an establishment that
is respectable.

36:12.765 --> 36:14.700
Bomb Shelter's very respectable.

36:15.735 --> 36:17.937
Really? Have you looked at it?

36:17.970 --> 36:20.773
Now imagine that
on the Sunset Strip.

36:20.807 --> 36:22.208
Every time I drive
by your place,

36:22.241 --> 36:23.810
I feel like I need a shower.

36:23.843 --> 36:26.145
Goddamn, the last thing LA
needs is another comedy club.

36:26.179 --> 36:28.815
Man, I'm reinventing
the open mic business.

36:28.848 --> 36:30.549
Yes, you have.
And at $5 a pop,

36:30.582 --> 36:32.151
you are Elon Musk of the valley.

36:32.185 --> 36:34.253
Look, look, I'm
making money, all right?

36:34.287 --> 36:36.722
$300 a day, David.

36:36.756 --> 36:39.292
Look, it'll be more when
I have a bigger space.

36:39.324 --> 36:41.426
And look, no overhead,
no liquor license,

36:41.459 --> 36:44.130
no health department, it's
a low headache for you.

36:44.163 --> 36:46.098
It's a good business.

36:46.132 --> 36:48.000
Okay, fair enough.
I believe you.

36:48.034 --> 36:50.269
But don't tell me this.
Show it to me.

36:50.303 --> 36:52.772
My God, enough
of the ISIS Yoda bullshit.

36:52.805 --> 36:54.439
What are you trying to say?

36:54.472 --> 36:56.108
I'm saying clean it the fuck up.

36:56.142 --> 36:57.777
The place looks
like a disaster zone.

36:57.810 --> 36:59.178
All right, all right,
all right. I'll do it.

36:59.212 --> 37:00.512
I'll clean... I'll clean it up.

37:00.545 --> 37:02.682
But will you promise
to come do a set

37:02.715 --> 37:04.283
in a few weeks to see it?

37:04.317 --> 37:06.118
I know it's been awhile,
but will you come do a set?

37:06.152 --> 37:07.854
Yeah, I haven't done a standup
in years, but I...

37:07.887 --> 37:09.989
- A few weeks, okay.
- I will come.

37:10.022 --> 37:11.858
If you come to the set,
I'll do what you say.

37:11.891 --> 37:14.160
I will clean it up,
I'll do the whole thing.

37:14.193 --> 37:15.594
- Okay.
- Look, I've known you for ten years,

37:15.628 --> 37:17.296
I will... I owe you that
much, so I will come.

37:17.330 --> 37:18.530
Okay, thank you.

37:21.200 --> 37:24.536
- Thank you.
- Thank you, Cyrus, for your big fucking table.

37:33.045 --> 37:35.081
I'm going to get some
food, do you want anything?

37:35.614 --> 37:36.749
Um...

37:38.684 --> 37:40.186
I'm not much of a morning eater.

37:40.219 --> 37:43.155
- That's hard to believe.
- Ow.

37:43.189 --> 37:46.558
Dude, I've got some AC
inside, come in and cool off.

37:47.193 --> 37:48.895
I gotta handle
some stuff first.

37:48.928 --> 37:51.297
What the fuck are you doing?

37:51.330 --> 37:55.201
Some fucking hot yoga?
For Christ's sake!

37:55.234 --> 37:58.905
Get your fucking ass inside!

37:58.938 --> 38:00.505
Okay.

38:00.538 --> 38:03.075
You're no good to me if you're
dead on my lot. Go!

38:03.109 --> 38:05.978
All right. Thank you. Stop.

38:08.981 --> 38:11.483
Please don't ever fucking put your
finger in my belly button again.

38:11.516 --> 38:13.286
- Suck my balls!
- Right.

39:29.362 --> 39:33.699
Oh, my God.

39:34.433 --> 39:36.736
- There he is. You're go...
- What's happening?

39:36.769 --> 39:39.338
I'm, well, I'm good.
You're going up again tonight?

39:39.372 --> 39:40.773
Yeah, well, when
you got a hot hand,

39:40.806 --> 39:43.242
- you gotta keep playin' it.
- Very good.

39:43.275 --> 39:44.310
Play on, player.

39:44.343 --> 39:45.411
- Yo, Arnold?
- What?

39:45.444 --> 39:48.014
- Five dollars, man.
- Oh. Here.

39:48.047 --> 39:51.183
Oh yeah. That's probably gonna
be an omen.

39:51.217 --> 39:52.852
- Give me this.
- All right.

39:52.885 --> 39:56.022
Yeah, so the first
person I met in K-Town,

39:56.055 --> 39:57.189
I was like, "Oh,
where you from?"

39:57.223 --> 39:58.924
They were like,
"Oh, South Korea."

39:58.958 --> 40:01.526
I was like, "Oh, is that the
good or the bad one?"

40:04.463 --> 40:05.998
That was beautiful.
that was just about

40:06.032 --> 40:07.933
- as good as it gets.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

40:07.967 --> 40:09.668
Just put me up next.

40:09.702 --> 40:11.170
Where's all this
money coming from?

40:11.203 --> 40:12.537
Just put me up.

40:12.570 --> 40:15.341
Yeah, anyway, I live
in the van next door.

40:15.374 --> 40:19.278
And if the van's ever
a'rockin', don't come a'knockin'

40:19.311 --> 40:22.448
'cause it's just me
naked masturbating.

40:22.481 --> 40:24.450
Uh, okay. Yeah, anyway,
that's my time.

40:27.420 --> 40:28.821
Jesus.

40:28.854 --> 40:30.723
You got gambling
debts or something?

40:30.756 --> 40:33.558
The mic's not gonna suck
your wiener, Arnold!

40:34.427 --> 40:35.861
It's a lot like your
girlfriend in that way.

40:35.895 --> 40:37.263
Yeah, thanks, man.

40:38.596 --> 40:42.134
Yeah, so I moved in with
this girl from Mexico

40:42.168 --> 40:45.371
and I'm not sure if this makes
me racist or just stupid,

40:45.404 --> 40:47.473
but I assumed that she
would just wanna cook

40:47.506 --> 40:49.875
and clean for fun. Um...

40:51.944 --> 40:53.079
Uh...

40:53.879 --> 40:58.250
Yeah, uh, fuck it. That's my
time, and fuck relationships.

40:58.284 --> 41:00.920
- Whew! All right, gettin' outta here, big guy.
- All right.

41:00.953 --> 41:02.822
- Enjoy that pizza.
- Thank you.

41:02.855 --> 41:04.757
It's the healthiest thing you've
eaten all day, you piece of shit.

41:04.790 --> 41:08.360
Speaking of terrible.
Big guy, wow!

41:08.394 --> 41:10.362
Boy, that was a hard bomb.

41:10.396 --> 41:12.498
I think it might be time
to think about gettin'

41:12.531 --> 41:15.401
into real estate. What do you
think, big guy? Huh?

41:15.434 --> 41:17.536
It was so bad that
it was actually good.

41:17.570 --> 41:20.005
You should probably film
that and pitch it to Netflix.

41:20.039 --> 41:23.275
'Cause it would be unique
and original content.

41:23.309 --> 41:27.079
Wow, I've never
seen anybody bomb

41:27.113 --> 41:28.948
that many times in a row.

41:28.981 --> 41:31.050
That was... That was...
That was hard to watch.

41:31.083 --> 41:34.053
- Yeah.
- Bro, I need a drink <i>for</i> you.

41:34.086 --> 41:36.589
- You know, I need to forget this shit.
- Mm-hm.

41:36.621 --> 41:38.090
Shit was terrible.

41:38.124 --> 41:39.592
Yeah.

41:39.624 --> 41:40.960
Like bad.

41:40.993 --> 41:43.095
I need to black out
after watching that.

41:43.129 --> 41:44.597
You learned
something out of this.

41:44.630 --> 41:45.798
Yeah.

41:45.831 --> 41:47.867
Well, I think you did.
And that is?

41:47.900 --> 41:50.369
- And that is?
- What, what is it?

41:50.402 --> 41:52.404
- And that is? I'm just kidding.
- Oh my God.

41:52.438 --> 41:56.442
Look, and that is to never
do that shit again. Ever.

41:56.475 --> 41:57.977
Or you're gonna end
up like this guy.

42:00.513 --> 42:02.815
Funny. Very funny.

42:02.848 --> 42:04.383
Fucking definitely
don't want that.

42:04.416 --> 42:06.485
I'd rather live in a van
for the rest of my fucking life.

42:06.519 --> 42:09.455
Do you even pay for that
parking spot?

42:09.488 --> 42:13.159
My car is fucking
broken down, man. I...

42:13.192 --> 42:15.427
No, I don't fucking
pay for it, man.

42:15.461 --> 42:17.129
- His car's broken down...
- Fuck, man!

42:17.163 --> 42:18.297
Now you're gonna
break his spirit.

42:18.330 --> 42:19.598
What's wrong with you?

42:19.633 --> 42:23.302
Bro, he broke my spirit
by me sitting there.

42:23.335 --> 42:25.437
That shit broke me.

42:25.471 --> 42:28.841
One person's trash is
another person's treasure.

42:28.874 --> 42:31.343
Somebody probably
found that funny.

42:31.377 --> 42:33.679
You know what the problem is?
You're nobody's treasure.

42:33.712 --> 42:36.348
It's all good, I'm used to
people being jealous of me.

42:36.382 --> 42:37.850
Jealous of what?

42:37.883 --> 42:39.285
Dude, I see what you've
done with the place

42:39.318 --> 42:40.619
and I like it, man!

42:40.654 --> 42:42.521
Allegiance, ambition!

42:42.555 --> 42:46.358
Tell you what. Um, you know,
while you're trying to figure out...

42:46.392 --> 42:48.494
Whatever the hell it is you're
trying to figure out here.

42:48.527 --> 42:50.863
I was thinking maybe you
could host some mics for me.

42:50.896 --> 42:52.932
I live in a van, dude.
I should probably get a real job.

42:52.965 --> 42:54.800
Real job? What the fuck?

42:54.833 --> 42:57.970
You know how many comedians
would kill to host this mic?

42:58.003 --> 43:00.172
- A couple?
- Yeah. No!

43:00.206 --> 43:02.308
Like a lot. Like
thousands of them.

43:02.341 --> 43:05.377
What do you think, that
I can like pay my bills

43:05.411 --> 43:08.047
with the money I make
at the gig from the skinny?

43:08.080 --> 43:10.316
No, look, we all
gotta work, bro.

43:10.349 --> 43:13.552
Nelly works in an office,
Dante owns his own shop.

43:13.586 --> 43:14.987
- Dante?
- Yes.

43:15.020 --> 43:16.656
Tokyo Drift Dante?

43:16.690 --> 43:17.957
The very Tok... Yes.

43:17.990 --> 43:19.325
General Tso's Dante?

43:19.358 --> 43:22.294
The fat Asian catfish,
Dante. Yes.

43:22.328 --> 43:24.797
- Dante who ate the bat, Dante.
- Patient zero, yes.

43:24.830 --> 43:27.634
Oh my God. I thought he made
a fucking living off of comedy.

43:27.667 --> 43:30.035
Well he does, but he
also has a wife and a kid

43:30.069 --> 43:32.137
and how stupid would he
be to put all of his eggs

43:32.171 --> 43:34.073
in a basket as frail as
standup comedy, okay?

43:34.106 --> 43:35.975
- Wow.
- All right, yeah man, we all gotta work.

43:36.008 --> 43:37.409
It's the way it is.

43:37.443 --> 43:40.012
You know, nobody's...
Chris Rock after one month.

43:40.045 --> 43:42.481
So, you know, call some names.

43:43.782 --> 43:46.485
Take the money, and you'll
be rich in no time.

43:48.053 --> 43:49.255
- Okay, all right.
- Yes!

43:49.288 --> 43:51.557
I'll do it under
one condition.

43:51.590 --> 43:53.025
I'm not doing any
fucking standup.

43:53.058 --> 43:55.427
Oh my God, and you'd
be doing us all a favor.

43:55.461 --> 43:56.929
- All right, very nice.
- Wow, thanks.

43:56.962 --> 43:59.531
- All right, can I go to my home now?
- Don't get lost.

43:59.565 --> 44:00.734
Thanks, man.

44:54.286 --> 44:56.790
Bomb Shelter, this is Arnold.

44:56.822 --> 44:58.658
<i>Hi, is Dave available?</i>

44:58.692 --> 45:00.993
Uh, yeah, no. Dave won't
be in until later tonight.

45:01.026 --> 45:02.729
Can I, uh, take a message?

45:02.762 --> 45:05.799
<i>Yes, actually.
This is his ex, Sabrina...</i>

45:05.831 --> 45:08.802
- Oh. Hi. <i>And he's been
ignoring my calls for weeks.</i>

45:08.834 --> 45:10.670
- <i>Um, I need you to tell him that I'm moving soon</i>
- Yeah.

45:10.704 --> 45:12.471
<i>and I have a bunch of his stuff
in storage</i>

45:12.504 --> 45:14.273
<i>that he refuses to pick up.</i>

45:14.306 --> 45:17.576
I think this is kind of above
my pay grade, lady. Uh, you...

45:17.609 --> 45:19.311
<i>Tell him to call me
and pick it up.</i>

45:19.345 --> 45:22.448
<i>If he doesn't get it before
I move, I'm throwing it away.</i>

45:22.481 --> 45:23.849
Uhhh...

45:24.684 --> 45:26.720
Uh, ye... Uh, okay.

45:26.753 --> 45:28.688
- Oh, wait.
- <i>Yes?</i>

45:28.722 --> 45:30.856
If he doesn't grab it,
can I have his stuff?

45:32.991 --> 45:34.193
Hello?

45:35.361 --> 45:37.196
What's the perks
of living in a van?

45:37.229 --> 45:39.031
Oh, low rent.

45:39.064 --> 45:41.433
That's fucking funny,
you stupid fuck!

45:42.401 --> 45:44.436
You fucking idiot.

45:45.404 --> 45:48.440
Van. How many fucking
fat-boy-van-fucking

45:48.474 --> 45:50.710
jokes can I fucking do?

45:50.744 --> 45:53.112
Nothing, you fucking loser!

45:53.145 --> 45:56.915
Your parents hate you,
you're a fucking loser.

46:13.532 --> 46:14.701
Yo.

46:14.734 --> 46:15.901
Hey, guys.

46:15.934 --> 46:17.603
- Hey.
- Hey, wow. Um...

46:18.337 --> 46:20.105
why you so serious, bro?

46:21.273 --> 46:22.709
Your rent go up?

46:22.742 --> 46:24.744
I'd always worn out
my fucking welcome

46:24.778 --> 46:26.311
everywhere I've ever been.

46:26.345 --> 46:28.882
Family, friends, girlfriend.

46:28.914 --> 46:33.385
And it wasn't until I got
on this fucking stage

46:33.419 --> 46:37.423
here of all fucking places that
I actually felt like I was home.

46:37.456 --> 46:38.725
So, uh...

46:39.759 --> 46:43.162
The stage... feels like a van?

46:45.899 --> 46:47.867
Yeah. Yeah, it fucking does.

46:47.901 --> 46:50.169
All right... I've had
enough of story time.

46:50.202 --> 46:52.171
Someone else story time.

46:52.204 --> 46:54.741
Let's go. All right, bring
it up for your next guest.

46:54.774 --> 46:56.074
- I will...
- Fuck you. Fuck you.

46:56.108 --> 46:57.409
I will gladly follow that.

46:57.443 --> 46:59.879
We love you. Not.

46:59.913 --> 47:01.681
That was... That was beautiful.

47:10.255 --> 47:13.091
Uh... Damn! No, my bad.

47:13.125 --> 47:14.694
You know I was just playing
with you, bro.

47:14.727 --> 47:16.763
It's like... I... feel you
on that shit.

47:16.796 --> 47:19.264
This, the life of a comedian...

47:19.298 --> 47:21.400
ain't that motherfucking funny.

47:23.502 --> 47:27.206
And then you get that...
I don't...

47:27.239 --> 47:31.276
chance to make someone... laugh.

47:31.310 --> 47:35.614
That shit... that shit is
addicting, and then you just

47:35.648 --> 47:38.217
kinda continue to
chase that high.

47:38.250 --> 47:39.652
Are you high right now?

47:39.686 --> 47:41.320
- Okay.
- Get off stage.

47:41.353 --> 47:44.623
- Story time's over. Thank you.
- Thank you, Dr. Devontae.

47:44.657 --> 47:46.058
That's enough.

47:49.261 --> 47:52.832
All right, tell
us why you are sad.

47:52.866 --> 47:55.300
Oh wait, and why you don't like
girls that are hotter than you.

47:55.334 --> 47:57.770
Okay,
first, that's impossible

47:57.804 --> 48:00.172
'cause ain't nobody
hotter than me. All right?

48:00.205 --> 48:02.574
Second, I'm not sad.

48:02.608 --> 48:06.345
LA girls just remind me of my
dance team back in college.

48:06.378 --> 48:08.781
Yes, I came here
from Brooklyn to dance.

48:08.815 --> 48:11.450
You were a fucking
dancer? Like a real girl?

48:11.483 --> 48:13.853
Yeah. I didn't always
look like a plumber

48:13.887 --> 48:15.354
from the Great Depression.

48:15.387 --> 48:17.022
I'm actually hot shit.

48:17.055 --> 48:18.758
- Yeah, you are.
- Steamin' shit.

48:18.791 --> 48:20.827
Man, it was just
a culture shock.

48:20.860 --> 48:24.329
Everybody here is a model
or an actress,

48:24.363 --> 48:27.299
or some type of fucking special.

48:27.332 --> 48:31.503
I didn't look like
Barbie, but I could dance.

48:31.537 --> 48:34.540
And I was really close
with my team too.

48:34.573 --> 48:37.844
Until our senior showcase.
Our costumes came in

48:37.877 --> 48:41.014
and mine wouldn't even
stretch up past my knees.

48:41.046 --> 48:42.782
Some of these
bitches got together

48:42.815 --> 48:45.484
and they changed my measurements
as a fucked-up prank.

48:45.517 --> 48:47.119
- Oh my God.
- I see, yo. That's...

48:47.152 --> 48:50.122
Right, so no costume
and no choice

48:50.155 --> 48:52.558
but to back out of the show.

48:52.591 --> 48:54.961
Now I just feel like every
bitch out here is someone

48:54.994 --> 48:57.730
from my team pretending
to be nice to me.

48:58.831 --> 49:00.198
That's it, that's my story.

49:00.232 --> 49:01.400
Fuck.

49:01.433 --> 49:02.902
Yo, that's actually...
that's sad.

49:02.936 --> 49:04.904
That's as sad as
Arnold being too scared

49:04.938 --> 49:06.138
to get back on the stage.

49:06.171 --> 49:07.674
That's... You're probably
more sad though.

49:07.707 --> 49:09.174
Probably more sad
than her story about

49:09.207 --> 49:10.710
- the girls attacking her.
- Way more sad.

49:10.743 --> 49:12.679
There's only so many
fucking jokes I could write

49:12.712 --> 49:14.413
about living in a fucking van.

49:14.446 --> 49:16.281
Arnold, you're heartbroken.

49:16.315 --> 49:18.751
And you live by a fucking
dumpster.

49:18.785 --> 49:20.653
I would give anything to have

49:20.687 --> 49:22.755
that fresh hurt
again, all right?

49:22.789 --> 49:25.725
So how do you turn
fresh hurt into a joke?

49:25.758 --> 49:27.125
You have to.

49:27.894 --> 49:29.394
It's how we survive.

49:29.428 --> 49:31.698
No, I mean how do you
actually...

49:31.731 --> 49:34.399
write it? But...

49:34.433 --> 49:35.935
- Damn, that was fucking...
- That was on point.

49:35.969 --> 49:37.904
- That was deep.
- Right?

49:37.937 --> 49:40.572
Just gotta grow a pair
and face your shame.

49:42.140 --> 49:44.109
Listen, if you don't go
up on that stage again,

49:44.142 --> 49:46.178
everything your parents,

49:46.211 --> 49:50.482
or your ex ever said
about you is true.

49:56.421 --> 49:58.457
Let's uh, let's get the next
comic up.

49:58.490 --> 50:01.094
It's gonna be um...
Just Kyle.

50:01.126 --> 50:03.863
you know what? Fuck Just Kyle.
I actually got some shit to say tonight.

50:03.896 --> 50:05.031
I think back to the first day

50:05.064 --> 50:06.966
that I got my first porno mag.

50:07.000 --> 50:09.969
I'm from Ohio, there's just...
open nothing everywhere.

50:10.003 --> 50:11.470
So I run three miles in the back

50:11.503 --> 50:14.239
and I found a spot by
a tree, I was like...

50:14.272 --> 50:16.208
Yo Arnold, I need to
holler at you for a second.

50:16.241 --> 50:19.045
Yo, Amir. Meet me
in my office, dude.

50:20.245 --> 50:21.446
The dumpster?

50:21.480 --> 50:23.215
You want me to meet
you at the dumpster?

50:25.584 --> 50:28.320
Hey! Knock, knock, motherfucker.

50:28.353 --> 50:30.322
Your office is locked.

50:30.355 --> 50:31.490
Wrap it up, man.

50:31.523 --> 50:32.992
Fuck, dude, what?

50:33.026 --> 50:36.129
Hey, my band's kinda
tied up doing other stuff.

50:36.161 --> 50:38.798
I could really use a roadie
for my show tomorrow.

50:38.831 --> 50:41.233
- I'm auditioning for this guy.
- Yeah, that sounds really cool.

50:41.266 --> 50:43.069
But why can't you fucking ask
one of the other guys to do it?

50:43.102 --> 50:44.603
What, you got something
else better to do?

50:44.637 --> 50:47.006
It's not like you're writing
jokes. I've seen your set.

50:47.040 --> 50:50.076
Look, at least you'll
be in a vehicle that moves.

50:50.109 --> 50:52.011
- Awesome.
- All right.

50:52.045 --> 50:53.378
See you tomorrow at ten?

50:55.648 --> 50:56.683
- Fine.
- Nah, nah, nevermind.

50:56.716 --> 50:58.583
Okay, cool, great, yeah.

51:01.654 --> 51:03.956
"Guided meditation,
release anger."

51:03.990 --> 51:06.693
<i>Life can
certainly be difficult.</i>

51:06.726 --> 51:08.193
- Oh, Dave.
- <i>And keeping our emotions</i>

51:08.226 --> 51:10.328
- Super cute, right?
- <i>in check can seem...</i>

51:10.362 --> 51:11.496
<i>Frustrating.</i>

51:11.530 --> 51:14.399
Oh, you're totally not
doing this right.

51:14.433 --> 51:16.069
- Okay,
<i>In a moment...</i>

51:16.102 --> 51:17.436
- I'm getting out of here.
- <i>The music will change.</i>

51:17.469 --> 51:19.038
Line up.

51:19.072 --> 51:21.040
No dick-fucking around!
This is a place of business!

51:21.074 --> 51:22.274
Fuck!

51:25.645 --> 51:26.913
My God.

51:29.247 --> 51:30.817
- Amir.
- Good to see you.

51:30.850 --> 51:32.317
- Thank you for coming.
- Yeah. Thanks for having us.

51:32.350 --> 51:34.286
- Come on in.
- Hey, what's up man?

51:34.319 --> 51:36.122
- Come on in.
- All right.

51:36.155 --> 51:38.057
- This place is nice.
- Do you want anything to drink?

51:38.091 --> 51:39.692
Nah, nah, it's okay.

51:39.726 --> 51:41.526
Have a seat, set up in here.

51:44.229 --> 51:45.497
I'm Arnold.

51:45.530 --> 51:47.066
You don't have to plug
that in, by the way.

51:47.100 --> 51:48.634
Oh. I mean, are you sure?

51:48.668 --> 51:50.136
'Cause, I mean I can
plug it in and...

51:50.169 --> 51:52.038
No, no, no.
I want to hear you.

51:52.071 --> 51:54.807
All right, I'll just...
start playing.

51:54.841 --> 51:56.142
It's called, "For You."

52:02.081 --> 52:06.085
When I was in high school,
I got fired from KFC.

52:06.551 --> 52:07.720
Um...

52:08.253 --> 52:12.825
I... stuck my dick in the mashed
potatoes and put corn on it

52:12.859 --> 52:16.428
and... turned it into a little
tiny corn on the cob.

52:16.461 --> 52:19.832
And my crush was there
getting a value meal

52:19.866 --> 52:22.869
and she saw my
tiny corncob dick,

52:22.902 --> 52:26.172
and didn't go to prom with
me because she saw that

52:26.205 --> 52:27.907
And she told everyone
in high school.

52:27.940 --> 52:30.877
And then my parents found
out, and my dad sat me down

52:30.910 --> 52:33.045
and told me he has
a corncob dick too.

52:33.079 --> 52:35.380
And I shouldn't
feel bad about it.

52:35.413 --> 52:37.884
And then it made me feel
bad that it's genetic

52:37.917 --> 52:40.418
and there's nothing I can
do about my corncob dick.

52:40.452 --> 52:43.856
But I just need to let go
of it and accept the fact

52:43.890 --> 52:47.359
that I am... I'm the Corncob
Kid, and that's just who I am.

52:47.392 --> 52:48.560
I'm ready whenever
you're ready.

52:48.593 --> 52:50.362
Ready? Okay.

53:04.076 --> 53:07.412

Dude. Fuck was that?

54:06.404 --> 54:09.407
You were like a real fucking
human being in there.

54:11.376 --> 54:13.312
Listen, man, I don't mind being

54:13.346 --> 54:15.948
your little fucking errand boy
'cause you're too chicken shit

54:15.982 --> 54:17.482
to let any of the
other guys see you

54:17.515 --> 54:19.952
for like who you really
are, but some advice...

54:20.820 --> 54:22.487
Uh, if you mean what you
just sang in there,

54:22.520 --> 54:24.657
then everything you
got going on outside

54:24.690 --> 54:26.491
of comedy is a
fucking privilege.

54:26.524 --> 54:28.194
Yeah, whatever, man,
just load the shit up.

54:31.396 --> 54:32.597
You hear me?

54:33.565 --> 54:35.201
The fuck man? Wait,

54:35.234 --> 54:36.969
just 'cause you heard my
song, you think you know me?

54:37.003 --> 54:38.371
You think you got
all the answers now?

54:38.403 --> 54:40.339
You don't know my
relationship. You don't know.

54:40.373 --> 54:42.642
Okay, I may not know
your fucking relationship,

54:42.675 --> 54:44.310
but I know that you got
a fucking choice, right?

54:44.343 --> 54:46.379
Like you had a choice
when you got kicked out?

54:46.411 --> 54:48.714
Started mooching off
everybody, living in a van

54:48.748 --> 54:51.117
like some motherfucking
white Tyler Perry and shit?

54:52.251 --> 54:53.819
Fuck! Jesus Cr...

54:54.854 --> 54:55.988
I've never punched...

54:57.290 --> 54:58.456
Tyler who?

54:59.457 --> 55:02.594
Just get in the fucking
car, man. Jesus Christ.

55:04.596 --> 55:08.000
One day, I went
to go see my friend.

55:08.034 --> 55:09.335
He worked at the sex shop.

55:10.602 --> 55:15.241
Upon my arrival, he was stocking
these dildos on the wall.

55:15.274 --> 55:16.943
I looked closer at these dildos.

55:16.976 --> 55:19.544
They had a sticker on it
that said, "Thin Cock."

55:19.577 --> 55:21.280
And I was like,

55:21.314 --> 55:22.848
"If that's thin cock,

55:24.650 --> 55:28.888
I'm in deep shit!"

55:28.921 --> 55:30.389
How do you exhale that out?

55:30.423 --> 55:31.958
How do you do that?

55:31.991 --> 55:35.560
Oh God! Oh God,
my foot's asleep!

55:35.593 --> 55:36.862
It's a bad one.

55:38.097 --> 55:41.434
My foot feels like...
just a bunch of jelly.

55:43.269 --> 55:46.205
Oh God, it's so deep.

56:03.122 --> 56:04.622
Did everybody Venmo?

56:05.490 --> 56:07.326
Who didn't Venmo?

56:07.360 --> 56:09.128
I used Cash App.

56:10.696 --> 56:14.867
All right. As long as
you Venmoed, it's fine.

56:35.955 --> 56:38.691
- Ow! What the fuck?
- That's for Tyler Perry, bitch.

56:43.528 --> 56:45.931
I got a call from some chick
who said she was...

56:45.965 --> 56:47.500
your ex, named Sabrina or
something.

56:47.532 --> 56:50.535
- Oh, yeah, don't worry about that. Just...
- Okay, cool.

56:50.568 --> 56:52.371
She said that she
wanted me to tell you

56:52.405 --> 56:54.273
to fucking call her back so you
can go pick up your shit.

56:54.306 --> 56:57.109
Dude, it's literally irrelevant,
don't worry about it.

56:57.143 --> 56:59.945
There's no rat... Just keep
doing what you're doing.

56:59.979 --> 57:02.681
Why wouldn't I fucking tell
you that?

57:02.715 --> 57:05.885
Oh my God! Nico, you
scared the crap out of me.

57:05.918 --> 57:08.454
How's my favorite
juvenile landlord doing?

57:08.487 --> 57:11.190
What horrible news are
you bringing to me today?

57:11.223 --> 57:13.025
Listen, man, we're having people

57:13.059 --> 57:14.794
that want to buy the property.

57:14.827 --> 57:16.996
They want to come in,
and they want to renovate everything.

57:17.029 --> 57:18.898
That's great! And then
I never have

57:18.931 --> 57:20.032
to see you again on top of that?

57:20.066 --> 57:21.901
- Guess so, yeah.
- That's amazing.

57:21.934 --> 57:24.136
The thing is, though,
we gotta raise your rent.

57:25.504 --> 57:26.872
Well, by how much?

57:26.906 --> 57:28.908
- Double.
- Jesus! When?

57:28.941 --> 57:31.177
With a $15,000 deposit.

57:31.210 --> 57:33.212
Jesus Christ, by when?

57:33.245 --> 57:35.247
End of the month.

57:35.281 --> 57:37.917
You can't just come in here
and drop all of that

57:37.950 --> 57:41.320
on me with a 30-day notice.
It's absolutely ridiculous.

57:41.353 --> 57:42.988
It's surely illegal.

57:43.022 --> 57:46.392
Dude, you have people
outside sleeping in their van,

57:46.425 --> 57:48.427
fucking by the dumpsters,
pissing outside,

57:48.461 --> 57:50.362
jerking off in
their fucking cars.

57:50.396 --> 57:51.497
What do you expect?

57:51.530 --> 57:52.932
They're in the car.

57:53.598 --> 57:55.434
Goddammit.

57:55.468 --> 57:57.203
This is a very
respectable establishment.

57:57.236 --> 57:58.704
Oh!

57:58.737 --> 58:02.575
- Fuck!
- Yeah, okay.

58:02.607 --> 58:05.444
Here's the paperwork.
have a good one.

58:05.478 --> 58:07.513
- Yeah, thanks a lot. I'll have a great one, Nico.
- Dave.

58:07.546 --> 58:10.249
Tell your dad to go fuck himself.
What do you want?

58:10.282 --> 58:12.985
- Dave, I need your help.
- You're fine.

58:13.552 --> 58:16.388
Sup. You guys got any
spots open for the 10 O'clock?

58:16.422 --> 58:19.024
Uh, no, we're... Actually we're totally
booked for the rest of the night.

58:19.058 --> 58:20.593
Fuck you guys.

58:21.127 --> 58:22.761
- Jesus Christ.
- That was fucking rude.

58:23.662 --> 58:25.898
- Oh my God.
- What if we put up a fucking tent

58:25.931 --> 58:28.067
and we can send people like that
to fucking...

58:28.100 --> 58:30.536
work in it right next to it.
That'd be kind of tight.

58:30.569 --> 58:32.371
Arnold, my business
is about to collapse.

58:32.404 --> 58:35.374
I don't need you dick-fucking
around with me right now.

58:35.407 --> 58:39.278
Actually, dude, you turn
people away all the fucking time

58:39.311 --> 58:40.880
'cause you're so busy.

58:40.913 --> 58:43.916
What if you actually
set up a fucking tent

58:43.949 --> 58:45.584
and held mics in it?

58:45.618 --> 58:48.287
Oh my fucking God,

58:48.320 --> 58:50.256
if you fucking build it,

58:50.289 --> 58:53.325
they will fucking come, baby!

58:53.359 --> 58:55.227
- Two mics at the same time.
- Yes! Fucking...

58:55.261 --> 58:57.396
- More mics, more money, more business!
- Yes! Yes!

58:57.429 --> 58:59.098
- Bomb Shelters everywhere!
- Gimme that dick!

59:00.466 --> 59:02.334
- No, no. Go in, go in.
- In.

59:02.368 --> 59:07.339
Ooh, ahh, ooh, aah...
Two mics, same time.

59:09.175 --> 59:12.411
Yo, great set, guys.
Come on. Hey, in or out?

59:12.444 --> 59:14.613
Good job, Rob.
Just go, thank you.

59:14.648 --> 59:17.716
- Hey, what's up man? What's your name?
- Uh, what?

59:17.750 --> 59:19.685
Just say your name.
There's a bunch of people behind you.

59:19.718 --> 59:21.253
-Okay, yeah, yeah, Devontae.

59:21.287 --> 59:23.489
Devontae, you're
in the main room.

59:23.522 --> 59:26.125
- Thank you, sir.
- Pay Dave. Pay Dave $5.

59:26.158 --> 59:27.626
- Hey, what's your name?
- My name's Justin.

59:27.661 --> 59:29.161
- Main room. Five bucks. Dave.
- All right, thank you.

59:29.195 --> 59:30.329
Cyrus Jay.

59:30.362 --> 59:33.165
Cyrus Jay, Cyrus
Jay. Oh, right,

59:33.199 --> 59:34.466
you're actually in
the tent tonight.

59:34.500 --> 59:35.669
The what?

59:35.701 --> 59:37.937
The tent.
Right around the corner.

59:37.970 --> 59:39.371
Dave says this is the
improved Bomb Shelter.

59:39.405 --> 59:40.873
Why are we going to tent?

59:40.906 --> 59:43.677
Well, this is, but we're full.
Grand opening tonight.

59:43.709 --> 59:45.477
You probably signed up
for the wrong one online,

59:45.511 --> 59:47.613
- but the tent's right over here.
- All right.

59:47.647 --> 59:49.649
- Let's go make the best of a shitty situation.
- Okay.

59:49.683 --> 59:50.849
Do you have your five bucks?

59:51.651 --> 59:52.751
Yeah.

59:53.653 --> 59:55.321
All right. Everyone
give it up.

59:55.354 --> 59:57.189
Cyrus, really funny guy
coming to the stage.

59:57.223 --> 59:58.692
Come on, Cyrus!

59:58.724 --> 1:00:00.893
Miley, Cyrus!

1:00:08.067 --> 1:00:10.869
Yes, my name is Cyrus
and I'm from Iran.

1:00:10.903 --> 1:00:14.406
Thank you for not calling Homeland Security.

1:00:14.440 --> 1:00:17.476
You know, with this
light beaming upon me,

1:00:17.509 --> 1:00:22.147
the disgusting stench of
death poisoning our insides,

1:00:22.181 --> 1:00:24.049
this reminds me
of tents in Iran.

1:00:24.083 --> 1:00:25.719
Only thing missing is the cries

1:00:25.751 --> 1:00:28.187
of children being tortured
as we fall asleep.

1:00:29.955 --> 1:00:32.191
- What do you think?
- Eh, my set could have gone better.

1:00:32.224 --> 1:00:35.561
- Not your set. The place, bro, the fucking place, man!
- Aha, oh.

1:00:35.594 --> 1:00:37.563
- Well, you definitely built something here.
- Yeah.

1:00:37.596 --> 1:00:39.666
I don't know what it is, but
you definitely built something.

1:00:39.699 --> 1:00:42.501
This, this looks
fucking fantastic.

1:00:42.534 --> 1:00:45.571
But this... I wish you did not
show this to me, or anyone.

1:00:45.604 --> 1:00:47.506
You must burn this tent at once.

1:00:47.539 --> 1:00:49.375
You put him in the tent?

1:00:49.408 --> 1:00:51.110
I...

1:00:51.143 --> 1:00:53.212
You were not supposed
to see the tent, Cyrus.

1:00:53.245 --> 1:00:55.180
We just got so busy,
we had to do something.

1:00:55.214 --> 1:00:56.515
But that's the point, man.

1:00:56.548 --> 1:00:59.184
Look at how many people
are freaking here, man.

1:00:59.218 --> 1:01:01.954
Yes, you have turned
a shit hole into a shit store.

1:01:01.987 --> 1:01:03.757
Yeah, franchise, baby.
What do you think

1:01:03.789 --> 1:01:05.759
I'm trying to do
here, Cyrus, come on.

1:01:05.791 --> 1:01:06.959
Okay, give me a couple of days.

1:01:06.992 --> 1:01:08.527
Let me think about it, okay?

1:01:08.560 --> 1:01:10.764
First I have to go home and
wash the AIDS off my skin

1:01:10.796 --> 1:01:12.097
from this tent, okay?

1:01:12.131 --> 1:01:14.266
But congratulations on this.

1:01:14.300 --> 1:01:16.535
Al-Qaeda would be
proud of you, okay?

1:01:21.240 --> 1:01:23.042
Cyrus! Cyrus, bro.

1:01:23.075 --> 1:01:24.276
Listen, I gotta be
honest with you.

1:01:24.310 --> 1:01:25.577
My landlord is really trying

1:01:25.611 --> 1:01:27.246
to fuck me out of this place
right now

1:01:27.279 --> 1:01:28.947
and I just need you to
hold the Sunset location

1:01:28.981 --> 1:01:30.784
for me for a couple
more months, that's it.

1:01:30.816 --> 1:01:32.818
If you cannot make this
business, you have to let it go.

1:01:32.851 --> 1:01:36.088
No... God, listen. I just need
a little bit more time.

1:01:36.121 --> 1:01:37.589
It's all I have.

1:01:37.623 --> 1:01:39.892
David John, maybe
it's time to move on.

1:01:39.925 --> 1:01:41.960
You have been running
Bomb Shelter for years

1:01:41.994 --> 1:01:43.663
and you are barely surviving.

1:01:43.697 --> 1:01:45.331
You're dealing with
these open-micers.

1:01:45.364 --> 1:01:47.767
They're trying to fuck
you from every angle.

1:01:47.801 --> 1:01:50.836
You're a hard worker, do
something better, fuck this.

1:02:03.015 --> 1:02:04.550
What's Dave doing?

1:02:05.517 --> 1:02:07.019
He's either meditating

1:02:07.052 --> 1:02:08.921
or having a complete
fucking breakdown.

1:02:08.954 --> 1:02:10.089
Why, though?

1:02:10.122 --> 1:02:11.490
His landlord just
showed up and said

1:02:11.523 --> 1:02:13.492
if he doesn't come up
with 15 Gs for a deposit,

1:02:13.525 --> 1:02:14.828
this place is done.

1:02:14.860 --> 1:02:17.096
So what, like,
we gotta go back

1:02:17.129 --> 1:02:18.364
to all these other
fucking bullshit,

1:02:18.397 --> 1:02:19.932
random, out-of-the-hat mics

1:02:19.965 --> 1:02:21.634
where I gotta pay
like all his money

1:02:21.668 --> 1:02:23.670
just to wait for like
three fucking minutes?

1:02:23.703 --> 1:02:25.705
- Man, fuck this.
- Yeah.

1:02:25.739 --> 1:02:27.373
I mean, unless we come up
with a way

1:02:27.406 --> 1:02:29.341
to find the fucking
money, then, yeah.

1:02:29.375 --> 1:02:31.477
How the fuck are you gonna
come up with the money, bro?

1:02:31.510 --> 1:02:32.712
What are you gonna do?

1:02:32.746 --> 1:02:35.347
You're gonna sell
your ass in the van?

1:02:35.381 --> 1:02:36.816
No one's gonna
wanna buy you, bro.

1:02:36.850 --> 1:02:39.017
You're fat, and you're ugly.

1:02:39.051 --> 1:02:40.552
He's kinda cute.

1:02:40.586 --> 1:02:42.020
Amir, you guys work for
like big fucking comics.

1:02:42.054 --> 1:02:44.490
Can't you guys talk
to some of these comics

1:02:44.523 --> 1:02:45.891
that you're fucking
opening up for

1:02:45.924 --> 1:02:47.526
and have them come do sets

1:02:47.559 --> 1:02:48.728
it'll fucking raise
so much money?

1:02:48.762 --> 1:02:50.462
Hey, wait, wait, wait...

1:02:50.496 --> 1:02:52.699
How exactly do you
expect me to pitch that?

1:02:52.732 --> 1:02:56.068
"Hey, buddy, I know you
make $100,000 a weekend,

1:02:56.101 --> 1:02:59.037
why don't you come host
this open mic for free?"

1:02:59.071 --> 1:03:00.239
You're an idiot.

1:03:00.272 --> 1:03:02.574
I agree. You're an idiot.

1:03:02.608 --> 1:03:04.576
Amir, come on. Are you in?

1:03:04.610 --> 1:03:06.311
Yeah, I'll make some calls.

1:03:06.345 --> 1:03:08.547
You know what?
I'll make some calls.

1:03:08.580 --> 1:03:11.718
Nobody cares when
you call, Kyle.

1:03:11.751 --> 1:03:12.985
Watch this, straight
to voicemail.

1:03:15.855 --> 1:03:17.322
Hello, Mom?

1:03:17.356 --> 1:03:19.258
Just wondering if you know,

1:03:19.291 --> 1:03:20.926
I need to borrow
some money and...

1:03:23.595 --> 1:03:24.664
So that's a no, guys.

1:03:28.367 --> 1:03:32.371
Great set tonight, Kyle.
Lots of growth.

1:03:32.404 --> 1:03:34.808
You really knocked
it out of the park!

1:03:37.042 --> 1:03:39.011
Hey Dave, why don't
you just get a second opinion

1:03:39.044 --> 1:03:42.347
on that bad STD test, man?

1:03:42.381 --> 1:03:44.983
Thank you, Amir.
I appreciate the advice.

1:03:46.218 --> 1:03:48.755
Yo, like, I know
I'm hella talented,

1:03:48.788 --> 1:03:51.791
but Dave complimenting
me? I don't know, man,

1:03:51.825 --> 1:03:54.894
that felt a little weird, like
this feeling in my stomach.

1:03:54.928 --> 1:03:56.395
Like I dunno, man.

1:03:56.428 --> 1:03:58.230
It's called sympathy, stupid.

1:03:58.263 --> 1:03:59.766
It's what normal people feel.

1:03:59.799 --> 1:04:00.900
Yeah, but I don't like it.

1:04:00.934 --> 1:04:02.601
It's making me feel responsible,

1:04:02.635 --> 1:04:05.772
like I gotta do
something, you know?

1:04:05.805 --> 1:04:07.573
Bro, what do you think
we've all been doing?

1:04:07.606 --> 1:04:10.643
We've been trying to book
headliners to fix this place.

1:04:10.677 --> 1:04:12.745
I got it. Angela Nissel.

1:04:12.779 --> 1:04:14.079
- I can get her to headline.
- The TV writer?

1:04:14.112 --> 1:04:16.248
How the fuck do you know Angela?

1:04:16.281 --> 1:04:20.419
Check this out.
We go to the same Ralphs.

1:04:20.452 --> 1:04:22.287
Like, we could wait outside...

1:04:22.321 --> 1:04:25.557
Stop right there, bro.
That is insane.

1:04:27.794 --> 1:04:30.229
Look, I know you
guys make fun of me

1:04:30.262 --> 1:04:33.833
because I grew up rich and
you guys find me annoying

1:04:33.867 --> 1:04:36.468
and probably don't even
like my jokes, but...

1:04:37.871 --> 1:04:40.339
I love this place,
and I love Dave

1:04:40.372 --> 1:04:42.574
And I think I even
love you guys too.

1:04:42.608 --> 1:04:44.409
This place has given me...

1:04:44.443 --> 1:04:48.580
somewhere where I could find my
voice and be who I am, you know?

1:04:48.614 --> 1:04:51.149
And honestly, like, if
it wasn't for this place,

1:04:51.183 --> 1:04:52.886
I know you guys wouldn't
kick it with me.

1:04:52.919 --> 1:04:55.922
And to be honest, like, I don't
even have friends outside.

1:04:55.955 --> 1:04:56.956
Yeah, no shit.

1:04:56.990 --> 1:04:59.124
<i>♪ Ooh, yeah ♪</i>

1:04:59.157 --> 1:05:00.192
Look man, like...

1:05:00.225 --> 1:05:01.861
Hey, I'm playin', I'm playin'.

1:05:01.895 --> 1:05:05.932
This is my chance to give
Dave something more than $5.

1:05:05.965 --> 1:05:07.767
You know she's not
a standup, right?

1:05:07.800 --> 1:05:09.434
You don't know that.

1:05:09.468 --> 1:05:12.337
Plus you know how many
nerds are gonna be lining up

1:05:12.371 --> 1:05:15.340
to bother her after
we're done bothering her?

1:05:15.374 --> 1:05:18.811
And we're not even asking for
a job, we're giving her one.

1:05:18.845 --> 1:05:20.780
Man, this is crazy, man.

1:05:20.813 --> 1:05:22.882
It's stupid, it's creepy,
and you know what?

1:05:22.916 --> 1:05:25.718
Kinda illegal harassing
her like that.

1:05:25.752 --> 1:05:27.854
Man, my grandma was illegal.

1:05:27.887 --> 1:05:29.087
Huh?

1:05:29.856 --> 1:05:31.024
You in?

1:05:35.895 --> 1:05:38.564
Uh, why are we here?

1:05:38.597 --> 1:05:41.968
There's this white lady that
cooks these bomb-ass cookies,

1:05:42.001 --> 1:05:45.004
Angela never misses
a batch. Never.

1:05:45.038 --> 1:05:47.006
And you got this intel how?

1:05:47.040 --> 1:05:48.340
I mean, what the fuck, man?

1:05:48.373 --> 1:05:49.909
Bro, I buy those
cookies all the time.

1:05:49.943 --> 1:05:51.076
They're bomb as fuck.

1:05:51.109 --> 1:05:52.879
You know white people don't know

1:05:52.912 --> 1:05:54.814
how to season
their chicken, right?

1:05:54.847 --> 1:05:57.149
But they could sure put
sprinkles on their muffins.

1:05:57.182 --> 1:05:58.417
You know what?

1:05:58.450 --> 1:06:00.385
I do love some
white muffins though.

1:06:00.419 --> 1:06:02.487
Bro, Angela loves
those white muffins.

1:06:02.521 --> 1:06:04.023
All right, y'all stay here

1:06:04.057 --> 1:06:06.425
with your creepy-ass binoculars.

1:06:06.458 --> 1:06:08.928
I'm gonna go over there
and do the talking.

1:06:08.962 --> 1:06:11.597
Hey girl! Angela, right?

1:06:11.631 --> 1:06:13.666
Sorry, people always
think that for some reason.

1:06:13.700 --> 1:06:15.034
So, you don't come
here every Wednesday

1:06:15.068 --> 1:06:18.236
to get those fresh
mango cinnamon cookies?

1:06:18.270 --> 1:06:20.606
Apple cinnamon.
Who sent you, what's up?

1:06:20.640 --> 1:06:22.507
- Oh, nobody, mm-mm. I...
- Hey, Angela!

1:06:22.541 --> 1:06:24.043
- Well my friend...
- When's Scrubs coming back?

1:06:24.077 --> 1:06:25.577
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Oh, whoa, whoa, wait, wait!

1:06:25.611 --> 1:06:26.913
- She's got mace!
- Calm down.

1:06:26.946 --> 1:06:28.347
Y'all think y'all
can sun me, right?

1:06:28.380 --> 1:06:29.682
'Cause I got a little money?

1:06:29.716 --> 1:06:31.450
I'm from Philly. I take...
Mai Tai classes.

1:06:31.483 --> 1:06:32.919
- Shit, she's from Philly. She hard.
- We're comics...

1:06:32.952 --> 1:06:35.554
We're comics,
and we're just... That's it.

1:06:35.587 --> 1:06:37.890
Look, wait, wait, wait.
look, our buddy's business

1:06:37.924 --> 1:06:39.959
is going under and we're
throwing a fundraiser

1:06:39.993 --> 1:06:43.062
and we could really use your
help with saving his business.

1:06:43.096 --> 1:06:44.731
Please put the pepper spray
down.

1:06:44.764 --> 1:06:46.733
I've just washed my hair and
we just want to make sure

1:06:46.766 --> 1:06:48.935
our friend Dave's
open mic doesn't fail.

1:06:48.968 --> 1:06:50.770
Here's a flyer.

1:06:50.803 --> 1:06:52.105
- Here's a flyer.
- That's a cat.

1:06:52.137 --> 1:06:53.472
- Again?
- Your hair looks cute though.

1:06:53.505 --> 1:06:54.874
- Thank you.
- It does, what do you use?

1:06:54.907 --> 1:06:56.976
- Oh, Miss Jessie's.
- That's the shit.

1:06:57.010 --> 1:06:58.911
Curly girls! I love you,
thank you.

1:06:58.945 --> 1:07:01.648
Listen, I'm gonna be honest like
I've never been honest in my life,

1:07:01.681 --> 1:07:04.249
to myself, and to
them, and to you.

1:07:04.282 --> 1:07:07.053
But I've been doing
standup comedy for a while

1:07:07.086 --> 1:07:10.890
and I don't think
I've ever been funny.

1:07:12.825 --> 1:07:15.995
But... One day it's
all gonna click.

1:07:16.029 --> 1:07:17.496
One day, I'm gonna
figure it out.

1:07:17.529 --> 1:07:19.999
It's gonna click
like a remote control

1:07:20.033 --> 1:07:22.802
and that can't happen if they
close down The Bomb Shelter,

1:07:22.835 --> 1:07:24.236
which is why we're here.

1:07:24.269 --> 1:07:26.139
Maybe you can help us out.

1:07:26.171 --> 1:07:28.775
He's not lying, his mama doesn't
even love him. It's terrible.

1:07:28.808 --> 1:07:30.308
Yeah, he sucks.

1:07:30.342 --> 1:07:31.610
There. Not a cat.

1:07:31.644 --> 1:07:33.946
See, this is actually
kinda sweet.

1:07:33.980 --> 1:07:36.248
I don't do standup
though, sorry.

1:07:36.281 --> 1:07:38.651
You don't know till you try it.
you could be hilarious.

1:07:38.685 --> 1:07:40.086
I mean, you look funny.

1:07:40.119 --> 1:07:42.155
- Oh! Shit!
- Oh! Stop! Okay!

1:07:45.190 --> 1:07:46.491
Shit! Mother...

1:07:48.061 --> 1:07:51.030
Normally I love it when
a girl squirts my face.

1:07:51.064 --> 1:07:53.966
Not like this! Not like this!

1:07:54.000 --> 1:07:55.367
Will you do the show?

1:07:55.400 --> 1:07:58.104
Will you at least do the show?

1:07:58.137 --> 1:07:59.706
All right. I'll give
you my email address.

1:07:59.739 --> 1:08:01.373
- Yes!
- Get the fuck out!

1:08:01.406 --> 1:08:03.176
- She's doing the show, bro.
- man-up, Amir.

1:08:03.208 --> 1:08:04.944
- Thank God.
- It's worth it.

1:08:04.977 --> 1:08:06.445
- I'm gonna go get some milk...
- Thank God.

1:08:06.478 --> 1:08:07.880
I'll... I'll throw the milk
in your face...

1:08:07.914 --> 1:08:09.414
- and you'll be fine.
- Oh, God.

1:08:11.416 --> 1:08:12.852
Thank you, so much.

1:08:12.885 --> 1:08:14.453
- Thank you, thank you.
- Let me tell y'all,

1:08:14.486 --> 1:08:16.689
don't approach anybody
talking about squirting

1:08:16.723 --> 1:08:18.725
- and run up on their car like this, okay?
- All right.

1:08:18.758 --> 1:08:20.492
'Cause I was about to call
the cops on you.

1:08:20.525 --> 1:08:21.626
- Its okay.
- Thank you, thank you.

1:08:21.661 --> 1:08:23.696
- Water under the bridge.
- Email me.

1:08:41.714 --> 1:08:45.051
So, this is actually my
first time doing standup.

1:08:45.084 --> 1:08:47.186
If you didn't know,
I'm a TV writer.

1:08:47.220 --> 1:08:48.654
And after meeting you guys,

1:08:48.688 --> 1:08:51.724
it's actually my last
time doing stand up.

1:08:51.758 --> 1:08:52.925
Haa!

1:09:11.443 --> 1:09:14.113
I don't have any money
for clothes, so...

1:09:14.147 --> 1:09:16.548
if you see me looking like I
just came out of a dressing room

1:09:16.581 --> 1:09:18.350
trying something on,
it's like,

1:09:18.383 --> 1:09:20.920
no, that's just
how I fucking look.

1:09:36.068 --> 1:09:38.370
I haven't felt
this uncomfortable

1:09:38.403 --> 1:09:42.141
in a sea of broken dreams
since...

1:09:42.175 --> 1:09:45.211
Actually, never. Because
I actually followed my dreams.

1:09:45.244 --> 1:09:48.413
I just said I'm a TV writer and I
don't stalk people outside of Ralphs.

1:10:02.695 --> 1:10:06.899
The only problem is... I get
reminiscence of growing up

1:10:06.933 --> 1:10:08.968
because I used to
share the bathroom with

1:10:09.001 --> 1:10:10.136
everyone in
my fucking family.

1:10:10.169 --> 1:10:12.104
We had a one bathroom,
massive family,

1:10:12.138 --> 1:10:14.140
except now I'm just sharing
it with the homeless people

1:10:14.173 --> 1:10:16.275
who are trying to get
in the van with me.

1:10:23.816 --> 1:10:27.787
Speaking of dreams,
if anyone has any ideas

1:10:27.820 --> 1:10:31.423
or email requests
or collaborations,

1:10:31.456 --> 1:10:33.993
I'm currently only
taking sexual favors.

1:10:34.026 --> 1:10:37.529
So you can
take the rest to my agent.

1:10:41.133 --> 1:10:43.468
I've never realized that I'm
actually like a big person.

1:10:43.501 --> 1:10:45.470
Recently, one of
those things happened.

1:10:45.503 --> 1:10:47.840
I was crossing the
street late one night.

1:10:47.874 --> 1:10:50.176
He just looks at me and he goes,

1:10:50.209 --> 1:10:52.979
"Defensive end or lineman?"

1:10:53.012 --> 1:10:55.181
And without missing a beat,
I go, "Tennis player."

1:11:00.987 --> 1:11:04.824
- You're actually really good.
- Don't sound so surprised.

1:11:04.857 --> 1:11:08.694
- I mean, you always made me laugh, but you're...
- Yeah.

1:11:08.728 --> 1:11:11.563
- you're... "Funny" funny.
- Oh, thanks.

1:11:11.596 --> 1:11:14.133
Do you want to... go grab
dinner?

1:11:15.034 --> 1:11:16.335
Uh...

1:11:16.369 --> 1:11:18.738
- That sounds good, yeah.
- Yeah? Cool. Um...

1:11:18.771 --> 1:11:21.539
- Not tonight. Um...
- Boundaries, yes.

1:11:21.573 --> 1:11:24.844
- Maybe next Saturday?
- Saturday. Uh, yeah.

1:11:24.877 --> 1:11:27.246
I can't do it anymore.
Dude, I can't do it.

1:11:27.280 --> 1:11:30.182
I just hosted three hours in
the tent mic, three hours!

1:11:30.216 --> 1:11:33.418
I did not move here for this
shit. You understand that?

1:11:33.451 --> 1:11:37.323
I have Arian blood. I am
too good for that tent mic!

1:11:37.356 --> 1:11:39.926
Yo, psycho, all you had
to do is come and ask me,

1:11:39.959 --> 1:11:42.560
I would have switched with you and
I would have hosted in the tent.

1:11:42.594 --> 1:11:45.665
Oh. Okay. Well,
I'll see you around.

1:11:46.799 --> 1:11:49.534
Oh, uh, do not go in there,
okay?

1:11:49.567 --> 1:11:53.272
Seriously, it's a damnation
of inferno. You will burn!

1:11:53.306 --> 1:11:56.108
It is hell. You don't
want to be in hell, okay?

1:11:56.142 --> 1:11:59.178
I like your haircut.
Have a good day!

1:12:01.446 --> 1:12:03.683
- Saturday?
- Saturday.

1:12:03.716 --> 1:12:05.184
- Don't forget.
- Okay.

1:12:06.752 --> 1:12:07.920
Bye.

1:12:50.296 --> 1:12:52.798
There's literally no reason why
an earthquake

1:12:52.832 --> 1:12:55.301
should be classified
as a natural disaster.

1:12:55.334 --> 1:12:58.137
It's only a disaster because
we decided to build cities

1:12:58.170 --> 1:12:59.472
on fricking fault lines!

1:12:59.504 --> 1:13:01.007
Why are we doing this?

1:13:01.040 --> 1:13:03.109
It doesn't make any sense, it...

1:13:03.142 --> 1:13:04.643
My bad.

1:13:04.677 --> 1:13:06.278
Hey, who just walked
in here right now?

1:13:06.312 --> 1:13:09.514
Turn on the lights. Who just
walked in here right now?

1:13:09.547 --> 1:13:13.019
Oh. Yeah, Devontae,
you're late again, man.

1:13:13.052 --> 1:13:15.287
- You know the rules. Beat it.
- Beat it?

1:13:15.321 --> 1:13:16.956
Yo, it's like 10 minutes.

1:13:16.989 --> 1:13:18.824
Well, the cutoff is five
minutes, man. You know this.

1:13:18.858 --> 1:13:20.159
Okay, yo, can I just watch?

1:13:20.192 --> 1:13:22.361
Fine, it's fine,
just find a seat. Okay...

1:13:22.395 --> 1:13:24.697
There's no seats, so I'm
gonna stand. It's cool.

1:13:24.730 --> 1:13:27.700
No fucking standing
in the back, Devontae!

1:13:29.201 --> 1:13:31.603
Yo, you're fucking crazy, bro!

1:13:31.637 --> 1:13:35.474
Prima donna motherfuckers!
Fucking come in here late

1:13:35.508 --> 1:13:38.144
every day. Goddammit!

1:13:38.177 --> 1:13:39.544
You want to be headliner, right?

1:13:39.577 --> 1:13:40.846
You wanna be a
fucking headliner,

1:13:40.880 --> 1:13:42.982
show up on time to
the fucking mic!

1:13:43.015 --> 1:13:44.050
Fuck!

1:13:44.083 --> 1:13:46.952
God... dammit.

1:13:47.987 --> 1:13:49.755
Yo!

1:13:51.323 --> 1:13:54.360
Dude!
Yo, yo! Hey! Yo.

1:13:54.393 --> 1:13:56.695
- Yo! cut that shit out.
- Fuck Dave, man!

1:13:56.729 --> 1:13:58.364
He's always giving me more
shit than anyone else.

1:13:58.397 --> 1:13:59.832
- I can't take that shit!
- Dude! Dude, yo!

1:13:59.865 --> 1:14:01.867
Chill out, it's not
that fucking serious.

1:14:01.901 --> 1:14:03.969
Bruh, you ain't say shit
to him, so fuck you too.

1:14:04.003 --> 1:14:05.538
Yo, you're always
fucking late.

1:14:05.570 --> 1:14:07.406
And every time you're fucking
late, you cost him money,

1:14:07.440 --> 1:14:09.408
and you fuck someone out
of a spot. So chill out.

1:14:09.442 --> 1:14:11.043
Fuck those other comics, bro.

1:14:11.077 --> 1:14:14.146
Damn. I could do any other
fucking mic on the west side.

1:14:14.180 --> 1:14:15.514
Listen, I'm gonna
stop you right there.

1:14:15.548 --> 1:14:17.216
You gotta understand how
fucking Dave is, dude.

1:14:17.249 --> 1:14:19.318
Look, I understand. He sees
a young brother like me

1:14:19.351 --> 1:14:20.653
- and can't wait to fuck with me.
- Oh, my...

1:14:20.686 --> 1:14:21.754
I'm not doing
this shit no more.

1:14:21.787 --> 1:14:23.255
Turn down hosting fucking mics

1:14:23.289 --> 1:14:24.423
at the fucking
Store for this shit.

1:14:24.457 --> 1:14:26.225
You've turned down
mics at The Store?

1:14:27.093 --> 1:14:28.761
Yeah, what?

1:14:28.794 --> 1:14:31.063
Then I wouldn't be able to...
'Cau... I Can't do both. I...

1:14:31.097 --> 1:14:33.666
- Dude, I love The Bomb Shelter.
- So?

1:14:35.600 --> 1:14:37.736
Look, when I
first came out here,

1:14:38.971 --> 1:14:41.740
Dave and I did like
a lot of the same mics.

1:14:41.774 --> 1:14:44.510
He showed me the scene
a bit. And then when I...

1:14:46.579 --> 1:14:48.047
His girl found out that
I was couch surfing,

1:14:48.080 --> 1:14:49.614
they let me stay at their crib.

1:14:49.648 --> 1:14:51.250
What was the difference
between couch surfing

1:14:51.283 --> 1:14:52.918
and sleeping on his floor?

1:14:52.952 --> 1:14:56.222
You don't know
shit about Dave.

1:14:56.255 --> 1:14:58.224
Yo, Dave used to live in
this big-ass fucking house.

1:14:58.257 --> 1:15:01.227
He had two guest bedrooms
and a Brita filter

1:15:01.260 --> 1:15:02.962
in every fucking room
and all this shit.

1:15:02.995 --> 1:15:04.797
- No fucking way.
- I'm dead-ass serious too.

1:15:04.830 --> 1:15:07.233
It must've been part of some
"pity the poor black boy" bullshit

1:15:07.266 --> 1:15:09.768
- 'Cause now this motherfucker out here's trying to kill me.
- Dude!

1:15:09.802 --> 1:15:11.570
If you know you can't
make the nine o'clock show,

1:15:11.604 --> 1:15:13.372
why don't you just sign
up for the 10 o'clock.

1:15:14.440 --> 1:15:16.809
Hmm, yeah.

1:15:16.842 --> 1:15:18.878
I don't really have
an answer for that.

1:15:18.911 --> 1:15:20.179
I feel like if...

1:15:21.347 --> 1:15:23.816
If I'm in a rush,
then I'm working hard.

1:15:24.250 --> 1:15:26.685
Oh, my God. That's the dumbest
thing I've ever fucking heard.

1:15:26.719 --> 1:15:29.421
And now I remember you're
20 fucking years old.

1:15:29.455 --> 1:15:31.190
Twenty and a half.

1:15:36.762 --> 1:15:37.963
Wow.

1:15:40.166 --> 1:15:42.902
Well... That was a...

1:15:44.638 --> 1:15:46.238
That was an
interesting mic, man.

1:15:46.272 --> 1:15:48.474
Yeah, I'm sorry
you had to see that.

1:15:48.507 --> 1:15:51.177
Pretty sure Devontae
thinks you're a racist.

1:15:51.210 --> 1:15:54.113
Well, yeah. You know,
it's just...

1:15:54.146 --> 1:15:55.748
Blacks, you know?

1:15:55.781 --> 1:15:58.517
Oh, look at that. You actually
<i>are</i> racist.

1:15:58.551 --> 1:16:00.319
Listen, the kid
has so much talent,

1:16:00.352 --> 1:16:02.688
he just needs to learn
how to respect the rules.

1:16:02.721 --> 1:16:05.257
I don't know, man. I kind of felt
like it was about something else.

1:16:05.291 --> 1:16:06.759
Yeah, well, maybe it's the fear

1:16:06.792 --> 1:16:09.128
of losing my livelihood has
something to do with it.

1:16:09.161 --> 1:16:11.597
Some nights when uh...

1:16:11.631 --> 1:16:14.433
When I'm hosting some
open mics, and uh...

1:16:14.466 --> 1:16:16.001
You know, I kind of just get
lost.

1:16:16.035 --> 1:16:18.003
thinking about where I'm
at in my life right now.

1:16:19.538 --> 1:16:22.041
I kind of think
about like, "oh wow,

1:16:22.074 --> 1:16:24.210
I'm fucking sleeping in a van."

1:16:24.243 --> 1:16:27.146
And it's enough to make you want
to blow your fucking brains out.

1:16:27.179 --> 1:16:31.150
But that's when I realized it's
all fucking temporary, man.

1:16:31.183 --> 1:16:32.451
And...

1:16:34.186 --> 1:16:39.191
It's kind of comforting to
say out loud, "I'm not okay."

1:16:43.062 --> 1:16:44.396
I'm fine.

1:16:46.899 --> 1:16:49.301
Is it fine to keep...

1:16:49.335 --> 1:16:52.137
sonograms of a kid
you almost had

1:16:52.171 --> 1:16:54.573
in the tool shed? And...

1:16:54.607 --> 1:16:57.009
ducking calls
from your ex 'cause

1:16:57.042 --> 1:16:58.911
you don't want to pick
up your shit?

1:17:02.915 --> 1:17:04.316
Arnold...

1:17:05.851 --> 1:17:08.587
You've done some nice
things here, and I'm grateful,

1:17:08.621 --> 1:17:12.491
but not everybody needs
to be fixed. Okay?

1:17:12.524 --> 1:17:14.360
No, you need to be fixed.

1:17:14.393 --> 1:17:16.495
You host stand up here for a
few weeks and all of a sudden,

1:17:16.528 --> 1:17:18.197
you're the zen master of MICerz?

1:17:18.230 --> 1:17:19.431
You're just like every
other wannabe comic

1:17:19.465 --> 1:17:20.700
- Hey, man...
- That comes in here, Arnold.

1:17:20.734 --> 1:17:21.867
I'm just trying to fucking help.

1:17:21.900 --> 1:17:23.002
Oh, yeah, sure you're gonna be
the one

1:17:23.035 --> 1:17:24.503
to save The Bomb Shelter now.

1:17:24.536 --> 1:17:26.205
You're not even trying...
You're not doing this for me.

1:17:26.238 --> 1:17:27.873
You're doing this for you.

1:17:27.906 --> 1:17:30.242
Some of us are actually
trying to do this as a career.

1:17:30.276 --> 1:17:32.044
You are just trying to do this

1:17:32.077 --> 1:17:33.747
to get your ex-girlfriend back.

1:17:33.779 --> 1:17:35.749
You're gonna go back... Right
from mooching off me,

1:17:35.781 --> 1:17:37.549
- right back to mooching off her.
- Hey, you ever think that

1:17:37.583 --> 1:17:39.184
- That's what you're gonna do.
- Maybe I want to do something

1:17:39.218 --> 1:17:40.619
with my fucking life? Look,

1:17:40.654 --> 1:17:42.955
that's your fucking
shitty open fucking mic

1:17:42.988 --> 1:17:46.091
- that you fucking host.
- And your van's parked in my parking lot.

1:17:46.125 --> 1:17:47.893
What do you fucking
want me to do, dude?

1:17:47.926 --> 1:17:50.462
I want you to stay here
for as long as it takes.

1:17:50.496 --> 1:17:52.398
So you could feel what
kind of... What it's like

1:17:52.431 --> 1:17:54.066
- to be a fucking loser like me.
- Oh, you fucking...

1:17:54.099 --> 1:17:56.902
You fucking live for hosting
shitty fucking open mics.

1:17:56.935 --> 1:17:58.237
Don't forget I'm your boss,

1:17:58.270 --> 1:17:59.405
and if you bring that shit up
one more time

1:17:59.438 --> 1:18:00.873
- you're fired!
- Oh yeah?

1:18:00.906 --> 1:18:02.374
- You're gonna fucking fire me?
- Yeah.

1:18:02.408 --> 1:18:04.209
- I fucking dare you to fucking fire me!
- Fucking...

1:18:04.243 --> 1:18:05.277
I'll fucking do it.

1:18:05.311 --> 1:18:07.613
You fucking bitch! Fuck you!

1:18:07.647 --> 1:18:09.649
I quit. Have fun
fucking banning people

1:18:09.683 --> 1:18:12.551
when there's no one fucking
here to come, you dumb fuck!

1:18:23.095 --> 1:18:24.396
Am I getting evicted?

1:18:29.501 --> 1:18:31.705
I was engaged
a couple years back.

1:18:33.138 --> 1:18:35.007
And, uh, she got pregnant.

1:18:37.176 --> 1:18:41.580
Had a late miscarriage.
Like... really late. And, uh...

1:18:45.551 --> 1:18:48.287
We never really
recovered after that.

1:18:48.320 --> 1:18:49.955
And uh...

1:18:49.988 --> 1:18:52.925
Last night I saw her
with her new husband and uh...

1:18:55.194 --> 1:18:56.362
their baby.

1:18:57.963 --> 1:19:00.834
Dude, I... I didn't know.

1:19:00.866 --> 1:19:02.134
I'm really sorry.

1:19:02.167 --> 1:19:04.470
That was supposed
to be my kid.

1:19:18.083 --> 1:19:19.853
I'm still in love with her too.

1:19:21.220 --> 1:19:22.822
Can you believe that?

1:19:22.856 --> 1:19:24.356
It's been years.

1:19:24.390 --> 1:19:26.860
She's got a family, and
I've got freaking nothing!

1:19:27.827 --> 1:19:30.396
I mean, you got me.

1:19:30.429 --> 1:19:32.197
It's not saying much, but...

1:19:33.065 --> 1:19:34.400
I think you just gotta...

1:19:35.668 --> 1:19:37.670
get your shit and
close the fucking door.

1:19:37.704 --> 1:19:39.071
I can't.

1:19:39.104 --> 1:19:40.973
I mean, if you don't
want to see 'em, I can go...

1:19:41.006 --> 1:19:42.241
No!

1:19:44.276 --> 1:19:47.546
Her having my stuff is the only
thing that still connects us.

1:19:47.579 --> 1:19:49.381
If we go to pick up my stuff
now, then it's over.

1:19:49.415 --> 1:19:52.184
You know? Like really over.

1:19:52.217 --> 1:19:54.687
You got to start
making healthy steps towards

1:19:54.721 --> 1:19:57.389
figuring out how to live
your life. Like...

1:19:57.423 --> 1:19:59.358
You know, you should make
a plan.

1:19:59.391 --> 1:20:00.894
I know you always talk to me
about making a plan,

1:20:00.926 --> 1:20:02.896
but I feel like you
should be the one to like

1:20:02.928 --> 1:20:04.363
go pick up your stuff.

1:20:04.396 --> 1:20:05.865
I'll go with you. I don't care
how... what you have

1:20:05.899 --> 1:20:07.734
to do to do it, I will help you.

1:20:07.767 --> 1:20:10.202
I know that's not saying
much 'cause it's fucking me,

1:20:10.235 --> 1:20:13.740
but let's go get your shit so
we can put this behind you.

1:20:13.773 --> 1:20:15.775
I mean, come on, look at you.

1:20:15.809 --> 1:20:18.343
You're Mr. No
Fucking Bullshitting

1:20:18.377 --> 1:20:21.380
Dick Heavy Metal God!

1:20:21.413 --> 1:20:23.015
Fuck, man time, right?

1:20:24.283 --> 1:20:26.051
All right!

1:20:26.084 --> 1:20:29.521
Three point five billion other
women out there to ruin your life.

1:20:29.555 --> 1:20:31.925
Let's get through
this, all right?

1:20:31.957 --> 1:20:33.125
Christ.

1:20:34.761 --> 1:20:35.961
What the...

1:20:37.496 --> 1:20:38.865
What the fuck
happened to your van?

1:20:38.898 --> 1:20:40.633
I forgot to tell you.

1:20:40.667 --> 1:20:42.968
I actually sold it to a fucking
junk collector.

1:20:43.001 --> 1:20:45.137
I got a couple
hundred bucks for it.

1:20:45.170 --> 1:20:46.472
- $200?
- Yeah.

1:20:46.505 --> 1:20:47.707
You're smarter than you look.

1:20:47.740 --> 1:20:49.408
I guess officially now, uh

1:20:49.441 --> 1:20:51.109
The Bomb Shelter's my home.

1:20:51.143 --> 1:20:52.946
Oh my God. That's very sweet,

1:20:52.978 --> 1:20:55.214
but I really wouldn't
tell anybody else that.

1:20:55.247 --> 1:20:56.950
Hey man. Do whatever
you want, bro.

1:20:56.982 --> 1:20:59.551
- You know, all that country shit you like.
- Really?

1:20:59.585 --> 1:21:01.553
Yeah, that
Keystone Light shit,

1:21:01.587 --> 1:21:03.756
some Alabama Slammer,

1:21:03.790 --> 1:21:06.091
- that White Claw with gin...
- Awesome.

1:21:06.124 --> 1:21:08.895
You know, some of that
titty twister, pink sand,

1:21:08.928 --> 1:21:10.395
panty dropper shit.

1:21:10.429 --> 1:21:12.331
- Never had one of those.
- Yeah man, it's on me, buddy.

1:21:12.364 --> 1:21:14.299
Even though you punched me
in the face, motherfucker.

1:21:14.333 --> 1:21:15.668
Yeah, I'm sorry about that.

1:21:15.702 --> 1:21:17.336
That's cool, I love
you, babe. You know?

1:21:17.369 --> 1:21:18.905
- I love you too.
- Yeah, but fuck you.

1:21:18.938 --> 1:21:20.172
Yeah, okay.

1:21:20.205 --> 1:21:21.573
All right, time
for Amiracle, baby.

1:21:21.607 --> 1:21:22.842
<i>♪ Ooh, yeah ♪</i>

1:21:22.876 --> 1:21:24.978
Yeah!

1:21:29.348 --> 1:21:30.616
You paying for that?

1:21:30.650 --> 1:21:32.685
Oh, no. I don't have any money.

1:21:33.987 --> 1:21:35.187
Hello, white ladies.

1:21:35.220 --> 1:21:37.289
Hey... Hey, you, upfront,
what's your name?

1:21:37.322 --> 1:21:38.490
Karen.

1:21:38.524 --> 1:21:41.593
<i>♪ Karen, always
Carin' for Karen ♪</i>

1:21:43.562 --> 1:21:45.063
Karen, uh...

1:21:45.832 --> 1:21:47.466
I like your necklace.

1:21:47.499 --> 1:21:49.167
You know what looks
better than that?

1:21:49.201 --> 1:21:51.136
A sperm necklace, you
know what I'm saying?

1:21:54.206 --> 1:21:56.608
Oh, like you've never
had a sperm necklace.

1:21:56.643 --> 1:21:57.877
Everybody wanna act
like they don't know

1:21:57.911 --> 1:21:59.946
what a sperm necklace is.

1:21:59.979 --> 1:22:01.346
Okay, maybe you do
know what it is and

1:22:01.380 --> 1:22:03.482
that's why you groaned.
'Cause it's gross.

1:22:03.515 --> 1:22:06.986
Hey, uh... Karen, uh...
are you with somebody tonight?

1:22:07.020 --> 1:22:10.155
- I can't see your boy. What's his name?
- Mark.

1:22:10.188 --> 1:22:12.090
Hey, Mark, go home, dawg.
You know what I'm sayin'.

1:22:12.124 --> 1:22:14.059
<i>♪ Ooh, yeah ♪</i>

1:22:14.092 --> 1:22:16.228
Hey, I want to see who this dude is.
I can't see nobody out there.

1:22:16.261 --> 1:22:18.463
Hey, hey, light bitches, let
me get a look at this dude.

1:22:18.497 --> 1:22:19.565
What does he look like?

1:22:19.598 --> 1:22:21.000
Put a light on this guy.

1:22:25.838 --> 1:22:29.074
Heh, oh, shit. It had to be you.

1:22:29.107 --> 1:22:32.177
Hey, man, Karen's cool as fuck.

1:22:32.210 --> 1:22:33.378
Hey, man, know what?

1:22:33.412 --> 1:22:34.881
If you were gonna eat a butt,

1:22:34.914 --> 1:22:36.916
it should be Karen's, all right?

1:22:36.950 --> 1:22:39.618
Karen's butt is the sweetest
in town.

1:22:40.419 --> 1:22:41.854
How do I know that?
I don't know that.

1:22:41.888 --> 1:22:44.590
I just... I'm just... Guessing.

1:22:44.623 --> 1:22:45.992
Shit. Oh, I got the light?

1:22:46.025 --> 1:22:47.326
All right. Well, I was
gonna get off anyway,

1:22:47.359 --> 1:22:48.761
so fuck y'all. All right.

1:22:54.132 --> 1:22:56.501
Hey, buddy. The fuck was that,
man?

1:22:56.535 --> 1:22:57.937
What are you doing up there?

1:22:57.971 --> 1:22:59.571
I was thinking I was doing
my job.

1:22:59.605 --> 1:23:01.273
Dude, I gotta pull you
from tomorrow's show.

1:23:01.306 --> 1:23:03.208
You can't be pulling that
kind of shit up on stage, man.

1:23:03.241 --> 1:23:04.376
What? Why?

1:23:04.409 --> 1:23:05.845
There's nothing
I can do about it, man.

1:23:05.878 --> 1:23:07.379
- It's already been talked about.
- You're the manager!

1:23:07.412 --> 1:23:08.948
You can do everything about it.

1:23:08.982 --> 1:23:10.717
My hands are tied
this time, all right?

1:23:10.750 --> 1:23:13.552
This is bullshit. What does
this have to say about comedy?

1:23:13.585 --> 1:23:16.455
If you're gonna pull a comic just for
bombing and doing some crowd work.

1:23:16.488 --> 1:23:18.390
Comedy. Comedy. Comedy!

1:23:18.423 --> 1:23:20.125
"I'm so funny, everything
revolves around me."

1:23:20.158 --> 1:23:23.096
Fucking tired of this shit.
Tired of everything, man.

1:23:23.128 --> 1:23:24.631
Fuck you, fuck your comedy...

1:23:24.664 --> 1:23:27.700
Hey, why don't you calm
your Lisa Bonet-lookin' ass down

1:23:27.734 --> 1:23:29.601
Fuck Lisa Bonet, nigga!

1:23:31.470 --> 1:23:32.939
Hey, man. You know
what's sad, dude?

1:23:32.972 --> 1:23:34.539
I actually thought
you were being genuine

1:23:34.573 --> 1:23:35.908
when you performed for me.

1:23:35.942 --> 1:23:37.944
I thought the whole
Amiracle thing was an act,

1:23:37.977 --> 1:23:39.311
but I see that's who you are.

1:23:39.344 --> 1:23:40.813
No one wants to work
with assholes,

1:23:40.847 --> 1:23:42.280
especially in this business.

1:23:42.314 --> 1:23:44.549
She does. She
loves my asshole.

1:23:44.583 --> 1:23:45.718
Mm-hm.

1:23:45.752 --> 1:23:47.754
Yeah, she lives in my asshole.

1:23:47.787 --> 1:23:50.155
- Fuck you, guy.
- She sucks farts outta my asshole.

1:23:50.188 --> 1:23:52.091
You'd be lucky to work
with a guy like this.

1:23:52.125 --> 1:23:54.326
Yeah. You love my
asshole, right baby?

1:23:54.359 --> 1:23:55.795
Yeah, absolutely.

1:23:55.828 --> 1:23:57.462
Yeah, she's gonna be licking
all around it tonight.

1:23:57.496 --> 1:23:59.598
- All the time.
- Yeah.

1:23:59.632 --> 1:24:03.102
I want to think about how
much I can put more stuff

1:24:03.136 --> 1:24:05.805
in my butt so she
could pull it out.

1:24:05.838 --> 1:24:07.974
Every night. I always
put stuff in his asshole.

1:24:08.007 --> 1:24:09.241
- He loves it.
- Yeah!

1:24:10.609 --> 1:24:13.746
Uhh... Wow, that was kinda
crazy.

1:24:13.780 --> 1:24:17.182
So, wha... Oh, um... What was that
all about? What just happened?

1:24:17.215 --> 1:24:19.085
I had to pull Amir
from the show tomorrow.

1:24:19.118 --> 1:24:20.318
- Oh.
- Yeah.

1:24:21.754 --> 1:24:24.322
As a matter of fact, do you know
anyone that could fill his slot?

1:24:24.356 --> 1:24:25.424
Oh, um...

1:24:29.361 --> 1:24:30.697
Yeah, I can do it.

1:24:32.832 --> 1:24:33.866
Who are you again?

1:24:33.900 --> 1:24:35.835
Oh, I'm Arnold. Arnold Wilson.

1:24:35.868 --> 1:24:37.937
Yeah, I live in a van.

1:24:40.073 --> 1:24:41.941
I run The Bomb Shelter.

1:24:43.308 --> 1:24:44.944
I got a hand job there once.

1:24:44.977 --> 1:24:46.311
Yeah, probably.

1:24:46.344 --> 1:24:47.714
Yeah, you know what?

1:24:47.747 --> 1:24:49.015
I'll put you in at eight.
This works great.

1:24:49.048 --> 1:24:52.051
Yeah, cool. That
sounds great. Dope.

1:24:52.085 --> 1:24:53.152
Cool, yeah...

1:24:53.186 --> 1:24:54.654
Just don't be late bro...

1:24:54.687 --> 1:24:55.855
- Yeah, for sure, I'm out.
- I've got a ton

1:24:55.888 --> 1:24:57.056
of other shit, man,
I'm telling you.

1:24:58.590 --> 1:25:00.860
Mary, actually, after
the show the other night,

1:25:00.893 --> 1:25:02.394
asked me if I
wanted to get dinner.

1:25:02.427 --> 1:25:03.896
And I told her I could,

1:25:03.930 --> 1:25:06.531
but I would potentially
need to borrow your car,

1:25:06.565 --> 1:25:07.867
if that was okay. But,

1:25:07.900 --> 1:25:09.401
it would like be proving to her

1:25:09.434 --> 1:25:12.471
like I'm putting my feet
in the right direction.

1:25:12.504 --> 1:25:14.707
If I let you borrow
my car tomorrow,

1:25:14.741 --> 1:25:18.543
you have to promise me that
you'll have it back by 9:00 PM.

1:25:18.577 --> 1:25:21.346
Because Dante and Amir, they
both have shows tomorrow

1:25:21.379 --> 1:25:24.382
and I need somebody here
to help me make sure

1:25:24.416 --> 1:25:26.585
that this fundraiser goes
off without a hitch, bro.

1:25:26.618 --> 1:25:27.887
- Yeah, done, yeah.
- Okay,

1:25:27.920 --> 1:25:29.554
I'm serious Arnold,
because I mean,

1:25:29.588 --> 1:25:32.225
I swear, with all those guys
gone and doing other things,

1:25:32.257 --> 1:25:34.060
I mean, I'm really under
the gun and I just...

1:25:34.093 --> 1:25:36.328
It's gonna be chaos, and I need
you to help me control it.

1:25:36.361 --> 1:25:38.263
- I'll be there.
- Okay.

1:25:38.296 --> 1:25:39.732
- You're
stealing our spots.

1:25:39.766 --> 1:25:41.868
How the fuck are
they your spots?

1:25:41.901 --> 1:25:43.401
Whoever fucking called it?

1:25:43.435 --> 1:25:45.037
You don't know what
the shit I'm going through.

1:25:45.071 --> 1:25:46.538
You guys wake up in
your comfy fucking beds

1:25:46.571 --> 1:25:48.573
while I'm sleeping
in a fucking van.

1:25:48.607 --> 1:25:51.210
I mean, maybe if you guys
grew some fucking balls...

1:25:51.244 --> 1:25:53.012
You don't have the balls.

1:25:53.045 --> 1:25:57.183
You just came in with your
ability to deep throat. I'm out.

1:25:59.218 --> 1:26:00.485
Fuck you.

1:26:01.821 --> 1:26:04.389
- Hey! You didn't pay for your shit.
- Arnold got it.

1:26:04.422 --> 1:26:06.125
Oh, no, Arnold won't.

1:26:09.494 --> 1:26:11.296
- So what's up?
- I don't know.

1:26:11.329 --> 1:26:12.865
I guess I'm just trying to, uh,

1:26:12.899 --> 1:26:14.700
control all the rage inside
that wants

1:26:14.734 --> 1:26:16.235
to kick your
initiative-taking balls.

1:26:16.269 --> 1:26:17.737
I don't get the big deal.

1:26:17.770 --> 1:26:19.272
I'm trying to take a job
to actually make something

1:26:19.304 --> 1:26:20.605
of this fucking comedy thing.

1:26:20.640 --> 1:26:22.474
I mean you both
should fucking try it.

1:26:22.507 --> 1:26:24.076
Really?

1:26:24.110 --> 1:26:27.113
What are you, the tall,
white, fat Kevin Hart now?

1:26:27.146 --> 1:26:30.817
You can get one gig, and you
think you're making moves?

1:26:30.850 --> 1:26:32.051
Fuck you.

1:26:32.084 --> 1:26:33.653
Move, get the fuck out my way.

1:26:33.686 --> 1:26:34.887
Wow.

1:26:35.922 --> 1:26:40.559
Well,
I need a fucking drink.

1:26:40.592 --> 1:26:41.961
Yeah, they, uh... they
do mimosas here.

1:26:41.994 --> 1:26:43.229
Yeah, I'm gonna have
to fucking order it?

1:26:43.262 --> 1:26:44.730
Where's your fucking
fake ID, huh?

1:26:44.764 --> 1:26:46.398
Yeah, you're clowning on me.
how you fucking like it?

1:26:46.431 --> 1:26:48.935
I have my card, so I'll buy.

1:26:48.968 --> 1:26:50.402
No, I don't have my ID.

1:26:50.435 --> 1:26:52.238
That shit fell through.

1:26:52.271 --> 1:26:55.074
What's the deal, are you
fucking pissed at me too?

1:26:55.107 --> 1:26:56.976
- Like seriously?
- Bro...

1:26:57.009 --> 1:27:00.146
Was it a dick move
to do what you did? Yes.

1:27:00.179 --> 1:27:02.248
Are you undeserving
of that spot?

1:27:02.281 --> 1:27:03.850
No question.

1:27:03.883 --> 1:27:05.818
Are you backstabbing everybody
that you met out here

1:27:05.852 --> 1:27:07.485
in your time of need?

1:27:07.519 --> 1:27:08.688
Undoubtedly.

1:27:09.822 --> 1:27:12.758
- Is it ridiculous to...
- All right, I get it, dude.

1:27:12.792 --> 1:27:15.995
No, no. But I...
I feel you, bro.

1:27:16.028 --> 1:27:18.097
Sometimes you gotta
do desperate shit.

1:27:18.130 --> 1:27:20.199
All right, I'm getting
us fucking drunk.

1:27:20.233 --> 1:27:21.901
Bottomless, please.

1:27:23.035 --> 1:27:24.971
Grapefruit, not orange.

1:27:25.004 --> 1:27:27.640
<i>♪ I wanna ride you ♪</i>

1:27:27.673 --> 1:27:30.109
<i>♪ I want, I want,
I want, I-I-I-I ♪</i>

1:27:35.248 --> 1:27:37.116
<i>♪ I wanna ride you ♪</i>

1:27:39.151 --> 1:27:41.721
<i>♪ Baby ♪</i>

1:27:41.754 --> 1:27:44.456
<i>♪ Got truth, want tru... ♪</i>

1:27:44.489 --> 1:27:47.525
Oh! Oh! Whoa!

1:27:48.094 --> 1:27:50.363
Oh! Oh no! No!

1:28:05.378 --> 1:28:06.611
Fuck.

1:28:13.518 --> 1:28:15.087
Griff, you're hosting tonight.

1:28:16.088 --> 1:28:17.390
Yeah, take this.

1:28:17.422 --> 1:28:18.758
Ah, fuck.

1:28:18.791 --> 1:28:20.226
I'm hosting tonight?

1:28:20.259 --> 1:28:22.261
- Yep. Arnold was supposed to be here.
- Why?

1:28:22.295 --> 1:28:24.030
I don't know where he is. He
should have been here by now.

1:28:24.063 --> 1:28:25.331
I don't know what's going on.

1:28:25.364 --> 1:28:26.431
I would have thought
you would have thrown

1:28:26.464 --> 1:28:27.934
every single chair in the room

1:28:27.967 --> 1:28:30.602
when you found out that he
bailed because of the gig.

1:28:30.636 --> 1:28:32.570
- Gig? He's on a date.
- Date?

1:28:32.604 --> 1:28:34.240
Amir lost his spot at The Store

1:28:34.273 --> 1:28:36.108
And he took it. Like an asshole.

1:28:36.142 --> 1:28:37.877
We gave him shit
for it. Check it out.

1:28:37.910 --> 1:28:40.279
Kyle, I'm sure he'll be
here after his betrayal.

1:28:40.313 --> 1:28:42.882
I don't know, man. You know,
he <i>was</i> drinking a lot.

1:28:42.915 --> 1:28:44.449
Like, a lot.

1:28:44.482 --> 1:28:46.686
What do you mean by a lot?
What the hell is going on here?

1:28:46.719 --> 1:28:47.887
- Too much.
- Kyle?

1:28:47.920 --> 1:28:49.989
Have you met Arnold?

1:28:50.890 --> 1:28:52.224
Your car's probably
in the impound

1:28:52.258 --> 1:28:54.060
with him sleeping
in it right now.

1:28:54.093 --> 1:28:57.863
There is no way that Arnold
is that freaking stupid, man.

1:28:57.897 --> 1:29:00.132
Oh my God. He knows that that
would totally tank

1:29:00.166 --> 1:29:01.701
our renewal fund, man.

1:29:01.734 --> 1:29:04.136
He knows that, right?

1:29:04.170 --> 1:29:05.371
Right?

1:29:19.752 --> 1:29:21.354
Maybe just throw one chair?

1:29:28.794 --> 1:29:30.796
I just want to know,
like...

1:29:30.830 --> 1:29:33.265
what I should do...

1:29:33.299 --> 1:29:35.634
to be <i>more...</i> funny.

1:29:35.668 --> 1:29:37.569
More funny than you are now?

1:29:37.602 --> 1:29:40.505
Most funny in like two months,
so I could headline.

1:29:40.538 --> 1:29:43.309
Maybe the comedy club, like
The J Spot or

1:29:43.342 --> 1:29:44.777
- The Store, or anything.
- Wow, yeah.

1:29:44.810 --> 1:29:46.145
I feel like, in greatness,

1:29:46.178 --> 1:29:48.347
you should always just
push the boundaries.

1:29:48.381 --> 1:29:50.750
- I feel like I'm close.
- You are very close, Chad.

1:29:50.783 --> 1:29:53.152
- Just Chet, bro.
- Chet, sorry about that.

1:29:53.185 --> 1:29:54.687
Be yourself, you
know what I mean?

1:29:54.720 --> 1:29:56.822
You gotta be honest.
It's about truth, honesty...

1:29:56.856 --> 1:29:59.358
- be yourself.
- Is this bandana honest?

1:29:59.392 --> 1:30:01.460
Now step two is a lot
harder than step one.

1:30:01.494 --> 1:30:02.762
That's step one.

1:30:02.795 --> 1:30:04.296
Without step one,
there's no step two.

1:30:04.330 --> 1:30:05.965
But step two, I'm gonna let
you in on a little secret.

1:30:05.998 --> 1:30:07.133
Do you want me to...

1:30:07.166 --> 1:30:08.667
No, come close.
I'm gonna tell you.

1:30:08.701 --> 1:30:10.703
- What, closer?
- Listen, it's a fucking secret. Okay,

1:30:10.736 --> 1:30:13.506
Step two, in this process,

1:30:13.538 --> 1:30:16.475
is... when you leave here
today...

1:30:16.509 --> 1:30:18.044
- Okay.
- I want you to get into your car...

1:30:18.077 --> 1:30:20.012
- I can do this.
- Turn on the car.

1:30:20.046 --> 1:30:21.180
Okay.

1:30:21.213 --> 1:30:24.549
- Drive home...
- Eco mode or sport mode?

1:30:24.582 --> 1:30:27.319
- Eco mode, of course.
- Okay.

1:30:27.353 --> 1:30:30.990
One mile per hour
over the speed limit

1:30:31.023 --> 1:30:32.391
to wherever it is that you live.

1:30:32.425 --> 1:30:34.994
- That's badass.
- Okay?

1:30:35.027 --> 1:30:37.196
When you get home, I want
you to get onto your bed

1:30:37.229 --> 1:30:40.699
and I want you to meditate
for 20 minutes.

1:30:40.733 --> 1:30:42.068
- So right up my alley.
- Okay?

1:30:42.101 --> 1:30:43.502
I can so do that.

1:30:43.536 --> 1:30:48.207
To the following mantra,
repeated after me.

1:30:48.874 --> 1:30:51.210
- Hi-yi-yi-ya, hi-yi-ya.
- Okay.

1:30:51.243 --> 1:30:54.046
Hi-yi-yi-ya, hi-yi-ya.

1:30:54.080 --> 1:30:56.482
Hi-yi-yi-ya, hi-yi-ya.

1:30:56.515 --> 1:30:59.085
- I kinda like it, okay.
- Hi-yi-yi-ya, ya-yi-ya.

1:30:59.118 --> 1:31:02.054
- Hi-yi-yi-ya, hi...
- Hi-yi-yi-ya, hey ya.

1:31:02.088 --> 1:31:06.325
At that point, I want you
to take two weeks off.

1:31:06.358 --> 1:31:07.560
Okay.

1:31:07.592 --> 1:31:10.429
And then never do
standup comedy again.

1:31:10.463 --> 1:31:11.897
- Okay.
- All right?

1:31:11.931 --> 1:31:13.766
Thank you, David.

1:31:13.799 --> 1:31:15.501
- Thank you, Chet.
- Great job up there.

1:31:15.534 --> 1:31:16.601
Very nice work.

1:31:16.635 --> 1:31:18.370
- And...
- Chet, Chad, Chet?

1:31:18.404 --> 1:31:21.540
- Chet. Just Chet.
- Chet, just Chet.

1:31:21.574 --> 1:31:24.577
All right, cool. I'll see
you guys later on my journey.

1:31:24.609 --> 1:31:27.179
Okay, all right.
And the bandana looks great.

1:31:27.213 --> 1:31:28.414
Thank you.

1:31:29.248 --> 1:31:31.083
- Wow.
- Oh my God.

1:31:31.117 --> 1:31:32.351
Hi.

1:31:32.384 --> 1:31:34.420
Where have you been?
Where have you been?

1:31:34.453 --> 1:31:36.422
You leave me here with these
people? Where have you been?

1:31:36.455 --> 1:31:39.091
Yeah, I feel really
bad about that.

1:31:39.125 --> 1:31:40.493
Oh my God.

1:31:41.626 --> 1:31:43.896
- So how's business?
- Business is good!

1:31:43.929 --> 1:31:45.965
Comedy sucks. I actually
had a little trouble

1:31:45.998 --> 1:31:47.366
getting all the seats
filled this week.

1:31:47.399 --> 1:31:48.567
Oh, I wonder why.

1:31:48.601 --> 1:31:50.703
Yeah, mainly
because nobody wants

1:31:50.736 --> 1:31:52.204
to watch people bomb for an hour

1:31:52.238 --> 1:31:54.707
and then come up there
and eat shit themselves. Yeah.

1:31:54.740 --> 1:31:56.108
That's pretty much it.

1:31:56.142 --> 1:31:58.611
Speaking of bombing, uh...

1:31:58.644 --> 1:32:00.813
- anybody from the crew ever stop by?
- Oh...

1:32:00.846 --> 1:32:04.483
Hell no. I wish. That's
why it's so good to see you.

1:32:04.517 --> 1:32:06.552
Dante and Amir are on tour.

1:32:06.585 --> 1:32:08.787
Devontae is hosting J Spot.

1:32:08.821 --> 1:32:12.391
I would suck a pirate's
asshole just to hear Kyle

1:32:12.424 --> 1:32:14.326
talk about having sex
with his sister, man.

1:32:14.360 --> 1:32:15.794
- Oh, no, oh, not good.
- That's how bad it is.

1:32:15.828 --> 1:32:18.764
That's how bad it is. Oh my God.

1:32:18.797 --> 1:32:21.100
Why did you quit?

1:32:21.133 --> 1:32:22.968
I... ugh.

1:32:23.002 --> 1:32:25.771
I think I realized that, uh,

1:32:25.804 --> 1:32:27.439
I dunno, I missed my window.

1:32:27.473 --> 1:32:28.774
- Oh my God.
- I kinda aged out.

1:32:28.807 --> 1:32:30.809
Oh, shut up.
That's the biggest pile

1:32:30.843 --> 1:32:33.112
of eagle shit I've
ever heard in my life.

1:32:33.145 --> 1:32:35.915
Nelly, why did you even get
into this in the first place?

1:32:35.948 --> 1:32:37.750
You aged out, get the fuck...

1:32:37.783 --> 1:32:42.054
You know why?
To make people laugh or cry.

1:32:42.087 --> 1:32:43.622
Both, if I could have it my way.

1:32:43.657 --> 1:32:45.624
Oh my God, that's the
thing with you young fucks.

1:32:45.659 --> 1:32:47.526
You know, you just want
everything right now, you know?

1:32:47.560 --> 1:32:49.628
You can't just
wait another year.

1:32:49.663 --> 1:32:52.666
It's what... You know, you gotta
put the time in, come on.

1:32:52.698 --> 1:32:55.968
Dave, I'm like two
years younger than you.

1:32:56.001 --> 1:32:57.803
Oh. Well, in that case,

1:32:57.836 --> 1:32:59.772
I'm surprised it took
you this long to quit.

1:32:59.805 --> 1:33:01.540
Jesus Christ, what are
you doing with your life?

1:33:01.574 --> 1:33:03.042
I do miss it though.

1:33:03.075 --> 1:33:04.644
Yeah, I know you do.
That's why you're here.

1:33:04.678 --> 1:33:05.945
- I missed you.
- Come here.

1:33:05.978 --> 1:33:08.147
All right. All right. Aw.

1:33:08.180 --> 1:33:09.281
Can I do five?

1:33:09.315 --> 1:33:10.883
- Yes, go!
- Thank you.

1:33:11.984 --> 1:33:14.753
Ladies, don't let
the patriarchy fool you.

1:33:15.387 --> 1:33:17.657
We could step into brothels too.

1:33:17.691 --> 1:33:20.226
Next time you're in Brazil,
I need you to go

1:33:20.259 --> 1:33:22.494
to La Casa de Big Platanos

1:33:22.528 --> 1:33:26.799
and you're gonna request
Senor Rico Gustavo Santiago.

1:33:26.832 --> 1:33:29.168
You're gonna request
the number three.

1:33:29.201 --> 1:33:30.803
You won't regret it.

1:33:30.836 --> 1:33:32.838
It's like...

1:33:32.871 --> 1:33:35.642
taking a ride on the Magic School Bus.

1:33:35.675 --> 1:33:37.509
Can't fucking wait to go back.

1:33:39.111 --> 1:33:41.313
I mean the first time I got
molly, I got it from my mom.

1:33:41.347 --> 1:33:44.250
We were rolling together,
and when we do drug deals,

1:33:44.283 --> 1:33:46.518
it's not like that
awkward, like,

1:33:46.552 --> 1:33:49.989
"Oh my God," like
drug-deal conversation.

1:33:50.022 --> 1:33:51.725
"How was your day?"
Ugh.

1:33:51.757 --> 1:33:54.893
All we do is talk about
who's gonna do the dishes.

1:33:55.861 --> 1:33:58.264
I loved your set. Oh my God.

1:33:58.297 --> 1:34:01.600
The Casa to Ponte Nino's?
Oh my God.

1:34:01.635 --> 1:34:04.603
I wasn't gonna do this, but
I just have to ask, okay?

1:34:04.638 --> 1:34:07.707
I am starting my own
all-female standup troupe,

1:34:07.741 --> 1:34:10.042
and we're just gonna be
touring like West Coast,

1:34:10.075 --> 1:34:11.711
all along the
Pacific coast trail.

1:34:11.745 --> 1:34:16.282
It's gonna be so pretty, and
it's, you know, not paid.

1:34:16.315 --> 1:34:18.417
But all expenses are covered,

1:34:18.450 --> 1:34:21.186
and our girl just like totally
ditched us last minute.

1:34:21.220 --> 1:34:22.656
And so we're just trying
to fill in the spot

1:34:22.689 --> 1:34:24.724
and I think you'd be
such a good addition.

1:34:24.758 --> 1:34:27.727
Oh my God, just, do you
wanna, like, check it out?

1:34:27.761 --> 1:34:31.096
The tour is called
"Yo Ga Girl Tour."

1:34:31.130 --> 1:34:32.931
Isn't it cute? I came up
with it myself.

1:34:32.965 --> 1:34:35.601
It's like, you know,
"You go, girl." Yeah.

1:34:35.635 --> 1:34:38.070
- Yeah, I get it. I get it.
- Yeah, you get it? Okay, so,

1:34:38.103 --> 1:34:39.739
We actually
like booked a shaman

1:34:39.773 --> 1:34:41.140
like straight from Peru, right?

1:34:41.173 --> 1:34:42.642
He's gonna bring some Ayahuasca.

1:34:42.676 --> 1:34:44.209
We really want to get in touch
with our funny bones.

1:34:44.243 --> 1:34:45.779
Because you know, all
comedians, especially fe...

1:34:45.811 --> 1:34:47.279
Yeah, you can
take my number down.

1:34:47.313 --> 1:34:48.614
Wait, wait. Really?

1:34:48.648 --> 1:34:50.717
Yeah, yeah. Please
just stop talking.

1:34:50.750 --> 1:34:53.485
I feel like dogs
are kinda like kids.

1:34:55.020 --> 1:34:58.157
Yeah, nice. Nice. That, um...

1:34:58.190 --> 1:35:01.093
Give it up again for um...

1:35:01.126 --> 1:35:02.394
I don't rem... I don't actu...

1:35:02.428 --> 1:35:04.798
I don't know who...
Yeah, who cares?

1:35:04.830 --> 1:35:08.067
I'm not even really
sorry y'all. I... This is...

1:35:08.100 --> 1:35:09.468
I can't believe y'all
keep having me come here

1:35:09.501 --> 1:35:11.170
for this shit.
You keep this going.

1:35:11.203 --> 1:35:12.304
Hopefully you got some drinks.

1:35:12.338 --> 1:35:13.673
I think you did. Some of you
did,

1:35:13.707 --> 1:35:15.107
'cause I heard some
people were laughing.

1:35:15.140 --> 1:35:16.408
There really wasn't
shit to laugh about

1:35:16.442 --> 1:35:18.243
the whole night. At all.

1:35:18.277 --> 1:35:20.012
None... They shit ain't funny.

1:35:20.946 --> 1:35:24.249
So... Fuck you for having me.

1:35:26.285 --> 1:35:28.487
Do you wanna... Wanna grab your
stuff?

1:35:28.520 --> 1:35:30.155
Yeah, that would be great.
Thank you.

1:35:30.189 --> 1:35:33.158
I have it... here in a bag.

1:35:33.192 --> 1:35:35.795
- so you can just...
- Oh, my God. Thank you.

1:35:35.829 --> 1:35:38.030
It's all ready to go.

1:35:38.063 --> 1:35:40.099
I don't know if you wanna go
through it, or...

1:35:40.132 --> 1:35:42.935
- Eh, seems pretty good.
- All there?

1:35:45.404 --> 1:35:46.605
Is that everything?

1:35:47.473 --> 1:35:49.108
Stay right here. You reminded
me.

1:35:51.711 --> 1:35:53.112
Do you...

1:35:54.413 --> 1:35:57.049
- Oh my God.
- Still play?

1:36:01.086 --> 1:36:03.857
It's been, um...

1:36:03.889 --> 1:36:07.226
- It's been years.
- It's something that maybe you...

1:36:07.259 --> 1:36:08.994
- pick back up, Dave.
- Thank you.

1:36:09.027 --> 1:36:10.295
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1:36:10.329 --> 1:36:12.164
Yeah.

1:36:12.197 --> 1:36:16.135
And, I'm sorry, too. You know...
I mean... I've been, uh...

1:36:16.168 --> 1:36:19.071
I've been such a big baby
about this whole thing. I...

1:36:19.104 --> 1:36:20.840
Literally, say no more.

1:36:20.874 --> 1:36:22.508
- Oh my God.
- You're fine.

1:36:22.541 --> 1:36:23.976
I... No, thank you.
And I...

1:36:24.009 --> 1:36:25.879
You're fine.

1:36:25.911 --> 1:36:28.681
Are you, uh... Are you...
Are you good?

1:36:28.715 --> 1:36:31.216
- Yeah, I'm taking care of myself.
- Good.

1:36:33.218 --> 1:36:34.721
All right.

1:36:34.754 --> 1:36:36.856
You got the... You ready?

1:36:36.890 --> 1:36:38.691
I don't think that comes off,
Dad.

1:36:38.725 --> 1:36:41.493
- Huh?
- I jus... I... Nothing.

1:36:41.527 --> 1:36:43.897
I think I almost got it.
I need the uh...

1:36:43.929 --> 1:36:47.032
Could you get me the number
four outta my bag?

1:36:47.065 --> 1:36:50.402
Please, 'cause I think
we're almost there.

1:36:50.436 --> 1:36:51.704
A number four.

1:36:51.738 --> 1:36:53.740
- Roman numeral?
- No, nevermind.

1:36:53.773 --> 1:36:56.676
There's only alphabet letters,
Dad. There's no numbers.

1:36:56.709 --> 1:36:58.912
Okay, okay. That's
all right, I got it.

1:36:58.944 --> 1:37:00.713
Okay, Arnie, let's...

1:37:00.747 --> 1:37:02.715
- Let's give it a shot, okay?
- Okay.

1:37:02.749 --> 1:37:04.316
- Give it a try.
- All right.

1:37:04.983 --> 1:37:06.051
Nope, nope, oh...

1:37:06.084 --> 1:37:07.186
- There we go.
- There it goes.

1:37:07.219 --> 1:37:08.721
I didn't flip the switch.

1:37:08.755 --> 1:37:11.190
- So it's fixed.
- All right.

1:37:11.223 --> 1:37:12.692
All right, good job.

1:37:12.725 --> 1:37:13.860
Good job.

1:37:15.762 --> 1:37:18.798
Got a little something
here for you.

1:37:18.832 --> 1:37:20.132
Yeah? Ah.

1:37:20.165 --> 1:37:21.768
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

1:37:21.801 --> 1:37:23.569
Needed that.

1:37:23.602 --> 1:37:24.904
All this hard work I'm doing.

1:37:24.938 --> 1:37:26.305
Yeah.

1:37:26.739 --> 1:37:27.941
I, uh...

1:37:28.808 --> 1:37:31.109
I got you something for your
birthday next month.

1:37:31.143 --> 1:37:34.814
Your mother said it would
be on my email here.

1:37:34.848 --> 1:37:36.148
Yeah?

1:37:36.181 --> 1:37:39.786
Ah. Okay... Just,
just go ahead and...

1:37:41.754 --> 1:37:43.723
Oh.

1:37:43.756 --> 1:37:45.390
Did we get it right?

1:37:45.424 --> 1:37:48.293
Your mother said you, you
were in a show with this guy.

1:37:48.327 --> 1:37:49.662
Yeah.

1:37:50.996 --> 1:37:55.267
Yeah, I did. That's, uh...
That's really cool, Dad.

1:37:55.300 --> 1:37:56.803
Uh, thanks.

1:37:58.838 --> 1:38:03.776
You look like I just
invited you to a damn funeral.

1:38:03.810 --> 1:38:05.945
I don't know, I just,

1:38:05.979 --> 1:38:07.780
I kinda miss it pretty
bad, that's all.

1:38:07.814 --> 1:38:11.851
No, you know, well.
Standup is not my world,

1:38:11.885 --> 1:38:16.154
but you know,
LA does not own comedy.

1:38:16.188 --> 1:38:17.523
Mm-hmm.

1:38:17.556 --> 1:38:19.926
If you miss making
people laugh,

1:38:19.959 --> 1:38:22.127
well, then, then do it.

1:38:22.160 --> 1:38:24.029
You could do it anywhere.

1:38:24.062 --> 1:38:27.165
- Yeah, yeah. Technically you're right.
- Yeah, of course I'm right.

1:38:27.199 --> 1:38:30.269
You make me laugh.
Every time you climb the ladder.

1:38:31.537 --> 1:38:32.805
God.

1:38:32.839 --> 1:38:36.843
"Oh! Ohh!"

1:38:38.243 --> 1:38:42.114
I got an idea. Why don't
you give this guy a call?

1:38:42.147 --> 1:38:44.984
Say you're in town. Oh!
You know what'll happen?

1:38:45.018 --> 1:38:47.152
I've seen this happen
all the time on TV.

1:38:47.185 --> 1:38:50.023
He calls you up
from the audience.

1:38:50.055 --> 1:38:52.792
You go up on stage. And
you do a couple of bits.

1:38:52.825 --> 1:38:55.728
Wow. I think...
I think you're right.

1:38:55.762 --> 1:38:56.996
Maybe his agent will be there

1:38:57.030 --> 1:38:58.330
and I can get signed by him too!

1:38:58.363 --> 1:38:59.699
- Yes! Yes!
- Oh my God.

1:38:59.732 --> 1:39:01.734
You're so right,
Dad. That's genius.

1:39:01.768 --> 1:39:03.135
Back to Hollywood.

1:39:03.168 --> 1:39:04.403
Back to Hollywood, there you go.

1:39:04.436 --> 1:39:06.873
- Back to Hollywood.
- Oh my God, Dad.

1:39:06.906 --> 1:39:08.641
Love you, but Jesus.

1:39:08.675 --> 1:39:10.009
But when it came down to it,

1:39:10.043 --> 1:39:11.343
I wanted to see what
them titties do, so I said

1:39:11.376 --> 1:39:14.681
"roll 'em on out
and roll 'em back up," you know?

1:39:14.714 --> 1:39:16.015
All right, let's keep it going

1:39:16.049 --> 1:39:17.684
for your next comic
coming to the stage.

1:39:17.717 --> 1:39:19.986
His name is Jared. Everyone
give it up for Jared.

1:39:21.054 --> 1:39:23.656
Yeah, come on, Jared. You're up.

1:39:23.690 --> 1:39:24.924
Here you go, man.

1:39:24.958 --> 1:39:26.592
Thanks, man. Thank you.
Thank you.

1:39:26.625 --> 1:39:29.561
So, uh, you know,
I celebrated uh...

1:39:29.595 --> 1:39:31.530
there being no, uh, drug
overdoses

1:39:31.563 --> 1:39:35.835
with a celebratory
beer and some oxies.

1:39:35.868 --> 1:39:38.905
Some oxies. Um...
That's everything I got.

1:39:38.938 --> 1:39:41.007
Thank you so much,
guys. Appreciate it.

1:39:44.443 --> 1:39:46.445
Eh, you know who I think

1:39:46.478 --> 1:39:48.447
is the biggest piece of shit on
Earth?

1:39:48.480 --> 1:39:51.583
That guy that picks
the neighborhood whore

1:39:51.617 --> 1:39:53.052
and makes that his girlfriend.

1:39:53.086 --> 1:39:54.954
Why would you do that?
That's so selfish.

1:39:54.988 --> 1:39:56.254
That's locking yourself inside

1:39:56.288 --> 1:39:58.123
Hometown Buffet
and there's a bunch

1:39:58.156 --> 1:40:00.727
of starving people outside,
why would you do that?

1:40:00.760 --> 1:40:02.095
You selfish motherfucker.

1:40:07.299 --> 1:40:10.302
Yeah, man. You remember
the old saying?

1:40:10.335 --> 1:40:13.006
Don't turn... You can't
turn a ho into a housewife.

1:40:14.139 --> 1:40:15.207
It seems like you guys have lost

1:40:15.240 --> 1:40:17.810
that saying in this generation.

1:40:17.844 --> 1:40:19.378
He was gonna
kick me out anyway.

1:40:19.411 --> 1:40:20.713
I... I fucking left before...

1:40:20.747 --> 1:40:22.081
You don't know that.

1:40:22.115 --> 1:40:24.083
You just assumed that he would.

1:40:24.117 --> 1:40:26.151
How did you know that he
was gonna kick you out?

1:40:26.184 --> 1:40:28.453
How do you know that?
You know what, you know what?

1:40:28.487 --> 1:40:30.089
I don't need to fucking
listen to this shit, man.

1:40:30.123 --> 1:40:31.556
Yes, you do. You know what?

1:40:31.590 --> 1:40:33.225
We didn't even think
you were that good.

1:40:33.258 --> 1:40:35.061
We just liked you because we
thought you were a good guy.

1:40:35.094 --> 1:40:36.328
And you know what kills me?

1:40:36.361 --> 1:40:38.831
You know what fucking
kills me inside?

1:40:38.865 --> 1:40:40.633
It kills me that I open

1:40:40.667 --> 1:40:42.334
for one of the biggest
comedians in the world

1:40:42.367 --> 1:40:45.838
and I'm calling you back
over and over again.

1:40:45.872 --> 1:40:47.640
You fucking cocksucker.

1:40:47.674 --> 1:40:48.975
What the fuck?

1:40:52.145 --> 1:40:53.445
Yeah, you're right.

1:40:53.478 --> 1:40:57.950
I avoid all my
problems. I always have.

1:40:57.984 --> 1:41:00.352
Thank you for letting
me know that's something

1:41:00.385 --> 1:41:01.654
I already fucking know, man.

1:41:01.688 --> 1:41:03.956
You can't run forever.

1:41:03.990 --> 1:41:07.093
And then you ran from
people that embraced you.

1:41:07.126 --> 1:41:10.029
What kind of fucking
shit is that?

1:41:10.063 --> 1:41:11.864
Okay, I fucked up.

1:41:12.732 --> 1:41:14.934
You're damn right.

1:41:14.967 --> 1:41:17.770
But at least... At least you
learned a valuable lesson.

1:41:20.006 --> 1:41:21.674
Okay. Which is what?

1:41:21.708 --> 1:41:23.375
To never do that shit again.

1:41:23.408 --> 1:41:25.277
And to go back up
again tomorrow.

1:41:33.251 --> 1:41:35.121
Oh, God. Come here,
man. Gimme a hug.

1:41:35.154 --> 1:41:37.222
You fucked up, so you
get up, you come here.

1:41:37.255 --> 1:41:38.623
Come on. Come here.

1:41:38.658 --> 1:41:39.892
Come here, come here,
come here, come here.

1:41:39.926 --> 1:41:41.060
- This is weird.
- Yeah, I know.

1:41:41.094 --> 1:41:42.561
So what, it's only us here.

1:41:42.594 --> 1:41:44.697
- You know what would make you feel better?
- What?

1:41:44.731 --> 1:41:46.833
If you suck my
dick a little bit.

1:41:46.866 --> 1:41:48.668
- Okay, oh my God.
- Come on, come on.

1:41:48.701 --> 1:41:50.703
Do you know what they call my dick?
The Little Weinstein.

1:41:50.737 --> 1:41:52.071
- All right.
- It creates headliners.

1:41:52.105 --> 1:41:53.673
Yup. Okay, I'm outta here.

1:41:53.706 --> 1:41:55.041
Come on, let me just
Weinstein your mouth.

1:41:55.074 --> 1:41:56.241
All right.

1:41:57.944 --> 1:42:00.747
He deserves it. He deserves
it, not the president.

1:42:00.780 --> 1:42:02.815
You know? Fuck,
he's got a mansion,

1:42:02.849 --> 1:42:04.183
he's got the private cook.

1:42:04.217 --> 1:42:05.918
I would do the job
just for those things

1:42:05.952 --> 1:42:07.352
with no money at all.

1:42:07.385 --> 1:42:10.056
I mean, it's not that
hard of a choice anyways.

1:42:10.089 --> 1:42:12.892
Oh my God, is that
who I think it is?

1:42:12.925 --> 1:42:14.426
Is that Arnold?

1:42:14.459 --> 1:42:16.062
What the hell are you
doing here right now, man?

1:42:16.095 --> 1:42:18.030
I'm sorry.

1:42:18.064 --> 1:42:19.832
You're... You...
I hope you're sorry.

1:42:19.866 --> 1:42:22.101
Who'd like to hear
Arnold apologize, guys?

1:42:22.135 --> 1:42:24.103
Come up here and tell
everybody that you're sorry.

1:42:24.137 --> 1:42:25.337
No, just come up here.

1:42:25.370 --> 1:42:27.173
- You're sorry?
- Come on!

1:42:27.206 --> 1:42:28.573
Let's get your apology here.

1:42:28.607 --> 1:42:30.509
All right, I'm gonna
go sit over here

1:42:30.542 --> 1:42:32.779
and I'm gonna fucking be your
audience, all right.

1:42:32.812 --> 1:42:34.513
Arnold Wilson, guys. Thank you.

1:42:36.249 --> 1:42:38.316
Apologize, bitch.

1:42:39.284 --> 1:42:41.220
So, uh...

1:42:41.254 --> 1:42:45.290
I did a, uh, fucked up thing
to Mr. Dave.

1:42:45.323 --> 1:42:49.361
- And I got his car impounded.
- What a dick.

1:42:49.394 --> 1:42:51.864
For getting my third
fucking DUI.

1:42:51.898 --> 1:42:55.701
And, uh, I ran away
so that I wouldn't have to...

1:42:57.402 --> 1:42:59.038
hear about it.

1:42:59.071 --> 1:43:02.574
And this is the first time
I've seen him since that.

1:43:02.607 --> 1:43:06.212
And I am here to say
from the bottom

1:43:06.245 --> 1:43:09.782
of my ice-cold, shallow
heart that...

1:43:09.816 --> 1:43:12.084
I fucked up and I am sorry.

1:43:12.118 --> 1:43:14.287
That's not loud enough,
Arnold.

1:43:14.319 --> 1:43:16.354
I fucked up.

1:43:16.388 --> 1:43:18.224
I'm fucking sorry.

1:43:18.257 --> 1:43:20.660
And I will never fucking
do that shit again.

1:43:20.693 --> 1:43:22.594
- Louder, Arnold!
- I didn't hear you.

1:43:22.627 --> 1:43:24.396
I'm terribly sorry for being

1:43:24.429 --> 1:43:26.666
a massive piece of fucking shit.

1:43:26.699 --> 1:43:27.800
- Louder, Arnold!
- Louder!

1:43:27.834 --> 1:43:29.101
We want more!

1:43:29.135 --> 1:43:33.940
Dave, I fucked up,
and I am sorry!

1:43:33.973 --> 1:43:37.276
I won't ever do that
fucking shit again!

1:43:37.310 --> 1:43:40.279
I'm sorry for fucking jerking
off in my van too much.

1:43:40.313 --> 1:43:41.814
I'm sorry for fucking...

1:43:41.848 --> 1:43:44.516
"I won't be
a backstabbing pussy," say it!

1:43:47.352 --> 1:43:51.123
I won't be a backstabbing
fucking pussy.

1:43:51.157 --> 1:43:53.625
Say it without being a fucking
little bitch about it.

1:43:53.659 --> 1:43:55.695
I won't be a backstabbing
fucking pussy, okay?

1:43:55.728 --> 1:43:57.596
"And I won't fucking
back-stab my fucking friends!"

1:43:57.629 --> 1:43:59.799
And I won't back-stab
my fucking friends ever again.

1:43:59.832 --> 1:44:01.399
"And I got tiny balls!"

1:44:01.801 --> 1:44:04.937
- I do have tiny balls. I do have tiny balls.
- Whoo!

1:44:04.971 --> 1:44:08.341
There we go. There we go.
Thank you, Arnold, thank you.

1:44:08.373 --> 1:44:11.210
Truth comes on thick.

1:44:11.244 --> 1:44:12.812
Well, you know, there's...

1:44:12.845 --> 1:44:14.446
someone told me last year
there's really no point

1:44:14.479 --> 1:44:16.115
in holding grudges, so.

1:44:16.148 --> 1:44:17.449
- Wow.
- Yeah.

1:44:17.482 --> 1:44:19.318
- All right.
- Tough lesson for me too.

1:44:19.352 --> 1:44:20.820
- Are we even?
- Yeah.

1:44:20.853 --> 1:44:22.788
Thank you. Fuck, man.

1:44:22.822 --> 1:44:24.522
Oh, God.

1:44:24.556 --> 1:44:27.293
Now we're even.

1:44:29.394 --> 1:44:32.698
It's just excuse after excuse
and it's just, like, oh my God!

1:44:32.732 --> 1:44:36.836
Get up there and just bomb like
a man, you know what I mean?

1:44:36.869 --> 1:44:39.404
'Cause they don't get
it. Every bomb is a gift.

1:44:39.437 --> 1:44:40.706
You're saying I have
that fucking gift.

1:44:40.740 --> 1:44:43.376
Yes! Your whole
life is a bomb, dude.

1:44:44.844 --> 1:44:46.245
You actually fucking play?

1:44:46.279 --> 1:44:47.647
- Yeah, man.
- Great.

1:44:47.680 --> 1:44:49.949

I was a dick.

It's okay. I forgive you.

1:47:04.917 --> 1:47:06.152
Really?

1:47:06.185 --> 1:47:09.221
I just learned to...
let go of all things

1:47:09.688 --> 1:47:12.158
and only accept what is.

1:47:12.191 --> 1:47:14.326
Because... what is is,

1:47:14.360 --> 1:47:17.730
and what is not is not.

1:47:17.763 --> 1:47:21.033
That does not... make
any fucking sense,

1:47:21.067 --> 1:47:23.702
but I'm glad I got to see you.

1:47:23.736 --> 1:47:25.538
We should hit up
a mic sometime soon.

1:47:25.570 --> 1:47:27.339
I gotta go meet up
with my girls for now.

1:47:27.373 --> 1:47:28.507
We got meditation.

1:47:28.541 --> 1:47:29.809
You meditate now.

1:47:29.842 --> 1:47:32.211
Mm-hm. I went
on a standup tour

1:47:32.244 --> 1:47:34.013
with all-female yogi comics,

1:47:34.046 --> 1:47:35.548
And I learned

1:47:35.580 --> 1:47:37.817
something really profound.

1:47:37.850 --> 1:47:40.319
That you made
a terrible fucking choice

1:47:40.352 --> 1:47:43.722
'cause you're not
a fucking yogi?

1:47:43.756 --> 1:47:45.524
No.

1:47:45.558 --> 1:47:47.059
That the lack of spirituality

1:47:47.093 --> 1:47:49.929
in comedy is a problem
for the future.

1:47:49.962 --> 1:47:52.264
However... The future...

1:47:53.466 --> 1:47:54.567
Is female.

1:47:54.599 --> 1:47:56.936
God, I hope not.

1:47:58.037 --> 1:47:59.305
Namaste.

1:48:00.873 --> 1:48:02.408
Motherfucker.

1:48:03.409 --> 1:48:05.344
There she is.

1:48:05.377 --> 1:48:06.645
Ow, fuck!

1:48:07.612 --> 1:48:09.515
What the fuck, man?

1:48:09.548 --> 1:48:11.917
Those, my friend, are the keys

1:48:11.951 --> 1:48:13.686
to your new apartment, okay?

1:48:13.719 --> 1:48:15.620
First key opens up the gate.

1:48:15.654 --> 1:48:17.857
Second key opens
up the front door.

1:48:17.890 --> 1:48:20.593
Yeah, I need you to work...
I need you to work here

1:48:20.625 --> 1:48:22.627
while I get the second
place up and running.

1:48:22.661 --> 1:48:24.063
Why, why me?

1:48:24.096 --> 1:48:25.764
I need someone here
that I can trust.

1:48:25.798 --> 1:48:28.234
I trust you a hell of a lot
less after you destroyed my car.

1:48:28.267 --> 1:48:30.402
Again, I don't
deserve this, but...

1:48:30.436 --> 1:48:33.139
Arnold gimme, gimme
one of those things, huh?

1:48:33.172 --> 1:48:35.841
Looking at you makes me want
to do horrible things to myself.

1:48:37.476 --> 1:48:38.978
Here's the thing, you know.

1:48:39.011 --> 1:48:41.280
When I used to watch you...

1:48:41.313 --> 1:48:44.984
- waking up every morning in that disgusting van.
- Aw, man.

1:48:45.017 --> 1:48:47.086
You know, just sweating your
balls off.

1:48:47.119 --> 1:48:48.420
You know, I thought to myself,

1:48:48.454 --> 1:48:52.158
if this guy can put
himself through that...

1:48:52.191 --> 1:48:54.760
Yo, and based on a very
thin monochrome of talent,

1:48:54.793 --> 1:48:56.462
let's be honest here, Arnold.

1:48:56.495 --> 1:48:57.596
- If that.
- Yeah.

1:48:57.630 --> 1:48:59.165
If I give him
an opportunity,

1:48:59.198 --> 1:49:00.599
there is a good
chance that this guy

1:49:00.634 --> 1:49:02.601
could be fricking great.

1:49:02.636 --> 1:49:03.869
Let me tell ya,

1:49:04.603 --> 1:49:06.839
I know you're not
gonna let me down.

1:49:06.872 --> 1:49:09.275
Are we... partners?

1:49:09.308 --> 1:49:12.278
We're beyond partners,
bro. We're family, man.

1:49:13.647 --> 1:49:15.281
Yes! God!

1:49:15.314 --> 1:49:17.082
Bomb Shelters everywhere, man!

1:49:17.116 --> 1:49:19.351
- All right, all right.
- Okay? All right?

1:49:31.330 --> 1:49:32.598
What's the deal,
you're not coming in?

1:49:32.631 --> 1:49:33.966
Just enjoy the new place.

1:49:33.999 --> 1:49:35.334
- Okay.
- Yeah.

1:49:37.637 --> 1:49:41.273
Um... You know man, I can't
thank you enough for...

1:49:42.408 --> 1:49:43.943
Just ev... Everything.

1:49:43.976 --> 1:49:45.477
Arnold, just try not
to fuck over any more

1:49:45.511 --> 1:49:46.946
of your friends and
everything's gonna be fine.

1:49:46.979 --> 1:49:49.481
- Cool. Yeah, totally.
- Work itself right out.

1:49:49.515 --> 1:49:50.684
Got it, yeah. Great.

1:49:50.716 --> 1:49:52.284
By the way. By the way...

1:49:52.318 --> 1:49:54.520
I decorated the whole
place myself, all right?

1:49:54.553 --> 1:49:56.589
It's fully furnished, it's
got everything you need.

1:50:16.742 --> 1:50:18.577
Awww!

1:50:28.087 --> 1:50:29.288
