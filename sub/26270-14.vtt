00:01.235 --> 00:03.204
ANNOUNCER: 9-1-1,
what's your emergency?

00:03.237 --> 00:05.239
This right here
is your stop.

00:05.273 --> 00:08.742
Catch all-new episodes
Mondays, and check out
our other Fox programs--

00:08.776 --> 00:12.012
Empire, Star, and The Resident.

00:12.046 --> 00:14.482
Let's use today
as an opportunity to
celebrate what's to come.

00:14.515 --> 00:15.749
ANNOUNCER:
Only on Fox.

00:20.020 --> 00:22.022
(birds chirping)

00:34.735 --> 00:36.270
(dog barking in distance)

00:36.304 --> 00:39.039
DAVID (chuckles):
Look at that.

00:39.073 --> 00:41.875
It's better
than the pictures, Dad.

00:41.909 --> 00:44.545
-Could I take a look at my room?
-(sighs)

00:44.578 --> 00:46.080
Have at it.

00:46.114 --> 00:47.915
Yes. Yes!

00:49.950 --> 00:51.119
Come on, Jamie.

00:51.152 --> 00:54.388
Go on. I'll be right behind you.

00:55.656 --> 00:57.691
-JAMIE: Alex, wait up!
-(Alex laughing)

00:57.725 --> 00:59.327
(laughs softly)

01:10.904 --> 01:12.773
We made it, babe.

01:12.806 --> 01:15.609
-JAMIE: Need some help?
-Hey.

01:15.643 --> 01:18.246
Just, uh, yeah, moving
is overwhelming, you know?

01:18.279 --> 01:20.080
I miss her, too.

01:21.315 --> 01:24.252
This was her dream house.

01:24.285 --> 01:25.919
If she hadn't been
in remission, I never

01:25.953 --> 01:27.221
would have gone through with it.

01:27.255 --> 01:30.924
I just wish
she was here to see it.

01:30.958 --> 01:33.794
She's here.

01:35.829 --> 01:37.431
Hey, buddy.

01:37.465 --> 01:38.932
JAMIE:
Don't worry, Dad.

01:38.966 --> 01:40.934
We're gonna
get through it, together.

01:42.136 --> 01:44.138
It's all gonna be okay.

01:47.308 --> 01:50.211
(car alarm beeping)

01:52.180 --> 01:54.148
(Jamie screams)

01:54.182 --> 01:56.450
(tires screeching)

02:00.354 --> 02:03.991
Alex. Alex!

02:12.132 --> 02:14.468
(phone beeping)

02:14.502 --> 02:16.970
AUTOMATED VOICE:
You have reached a number
that is not in service.

02:17.004 --> 02:19.006
If you feel you have reached
this number in error,

02:19.039 --> 02:20.474
please check the number
and try again.

02:20.508 --> 02:22.910
Check the number? It's 911.

02:29.250 --> 02:31.952
BUCK: Okay, so every unit
is different, but I think

02:31.985 --> 02:33.721
I kind of like
this one the best.

02:33.754 --> 02:36.724
Nice. You should totally
rent that apartment.

02:36.757 --> 02:38.392
M-Me? Wh-Why... why would I?

02:38.426 --> 02:39.827
Because I have my own apartment.

02:39.860 --> 02:41.462
You sleep in my dining room.

02:41.495 --> 02:43.897
Y-You don't think it's weird?

02:43.931 --> 02:45.933
Yes. That's why you should get
your own place.

02:48.269 --> 02:51.639
Okay, fine. It's a little weird

02:51.672 --> 02:53.207
to go back to my apartment,
but...

02:53.241 --> 02:55.643
I'm not just gonna force myself
out of it because...

02:55.676 --> 02:58.312
I got stabbed,
and it totally sucked.

02:58.346 --> 03:00.881
But then I remembered something
a wise man once said:

03:00.914 --> 03:02.683
"Life moves pretty fast.
If you don't stop

03:02.716 --> 03:05.185
and look around once in a while,
you could miss it."

03:05.219 --> 03:08.656
Ah, wise men of history:
Aristotle, Solomon, Dr. King,

03:08.689 --> 03:10.591
Bueller, Bueller.

03:10.624 --> 03:12.893
Don't mock me. I'm convalescing.

03:12.926 --> 03:16.029
Anyways, Ferris Bueller
only had one day off.

03:16.063 --> 03:17.665
I have weeks of free time,

03:17.698 --> 03:19.567
and I'm determined
to make the most of it.

03:19.600 --> 03:21.669
Last time I almost died,

03:21.702 --> 03:24.037
I didn't get
to have any fun at all.

03:24.071 --> 03:26.874
Is that why you're turning all
your clothes into index cards?

03:26.907 --> 03:29.176
Not all of them.

03:29.209 --> 03:31.044
What are you doing?

03:31.078 --> 03:34.348
I'm trying to determine
if this shirt sparks joy,

03:34.382 --> 03:37.518
and I did, and it doesn't.

03:37.551 --> 03:39.420
And now I thank the shirt.

03:39.453 --> 03:41.255
-Thank you.
-Okay.

03:41.289 --> 03:43.056
-You need therapy, Chim.
-(laughs)

03:43.090 --> 03:45.192
MADDIE:
I will still see my therapist.

03:45.225 --> 03:47.395
I'll go to my support group,
but I have to start putting

03:47.428 --> 03:48.929
little pieces of my life
back together,

03:48.962 --> 03:51.265
and work is a very big piece.

03:51.299 --> 03:54.935
It seems like, maybe,
you're moving too fast.

03:54.968 --> 03:59.206
-You need time to heal.
-I've been healing, for weeks.

03:59.239 --> 04:01.275
I'm sick of resting,

04:01.309 --> 04:03.210
I'm tired of talking
about my feelings,

04:03.243 --> 04:06.046
and I just want to go back
to the real world.

04:06.079 --> 04:07.247
Even if you're not ready?

04:07.281 --> 04:08.716
Once my life is normal again,

04:08.749 --> 04:10.618
then I will feel normal again.

04:10.651 --> 04:12.653
HEN:
You both just almost died.

04:12.686 --> 04:14.422
Now you're just gonna prance
over to her place

04:14.455 --> 04:16.390
and pick her up for dinner
like it never happened?

04:16.424 --> 04:18.959
No. Maddie is coming over here
to pick me up,

04:18.992 --> 04:20.794
because she is a modern woman.

04:20.828 --> 04:22.996
And also, I'm pretty sure they
couldn't get the bloodstains

04:23.030 --> 04:24.432
off that brick.

04:24.465 --> 04:26.800
(laughs softly)

04:26.834 --> 04:30.738
So I guess Maddie
still sparks joy?

04:30.771 --> 04:33.240
-Always.
-BUCK: Okay,

04:33.273 --> 04:35.242
so where are you
gonna take Chimney

04:35.275 --> 04:38.145
on your "second first date"?

04:38.178 --> 04:40.348
I have no idea.

04:40.381 --> 04:42.783
-(chuckles)
-BOBBY: Don't panic,

04:42.816 --> 04:45.319
because panic can be
more dangerous than flames,

04:45.353 --> 04:48.021
toxic fumes
or a sucking chest wound.

04:48.055 --> 04:49.790
Guys?

04:49.823 --> 04:51.825
Cap's a little intense, huh?

04:51.859 --> 04:53.661
Oh, he takes these talks
very seriously.

04:53.694 --> 04:55.295
BOBBY:
And all you need

04:55.329 --> 04:56.797
are three numbers.

04:56.830 --> 04:58.432
Can anyone tell me
what they are?

04:58.466 --> 05:00.300
ALL:
911!

05:00.334 --> 05:03.170
Yes. Now, does anybody know
what happens

05:03.203 --> 05:05.473
when you dial those numbers?

05:05.506 --> 05:07.808
-Harry Grant.
-They call a fire truck.

05:07.841 --> 05:10.544
Hmm. So much
for playing it cool.

05:10.578 --> 05:12.145
-Well, who's doing that?
-Our son.

05:12.179 --> 05:14.047
He didn't want the other kids
thinking he had

05:14.081 --> 05:15.949
the inside track just 'cause
he knows the captain.

05:15.983 --> 05:17.385
Oh, well, that went
out the window

05:17.418 --> 05:19.052
as soon as he walked
through the door.

05:19.086 --> 05:20.888
(both laugh)

05:20.921 --> 05:24.157
And now, what if I told you that
a big computer brain helps you

05:24.191 --> 05:25.793
when you dial 911?

05:25.826 --> 05:30.230
It is called CAD,
Computer Aided Dispatch.

05:30.263 --> 05:33.401
Let's say you, Harry, call in
an emergency. Can you name one?

05:33.434 --> 05:35.636
The library sets on fire,
and all our homework assignments

05:35.669 --> 05:38.238
-are burned up.
-(chuckles): Okay, there you go.

05:38.271 --> 05:40.307
All right, so when you dial 911,

05:40.340 --> 05:43.711
the dispatcher types in
your address into the computer,

05:43.744 --> 05:47.314
and then CAD automatically
finds your school,

05:47.347 --> 05:49.417
then finds
the nearest station and...

05:49.450 --> 05:51.485
-(alarm ringing)
-HEN: Station 118, Station 118,

05:51.519 --> 05:54.187
please dispatch a fire engine
and an ambulance

05:54.221 --> 05:56.824
to the Meadowbrook School
Library immediately.

05:56.857 --> 05:58.892
Harry Grant didn't
do his homework.

05:58.926 --> 06:01.161
-(laughter)
-BOBBY: All right, guys,

06:01.194 --> 06:03.664
who wants to check out
the trucks?

06:03.697 --> 06:05.332
-ALL: Me!
-All right.

06:05.365 --> 06:06.867
-Follow Buck and Eddie.
-Come on, guys.

06:06.900 --> 06:08.536
I want this side with me.
Let's go, let's go!

06:08.569 --> 06:09.570
-Watch out. (laughs)
-Come on!

06:09.603 --> 06:12.172
Yeah, seriously. There you go.

06:12.205 --> 06:15.543
Great performance, sir.
I enjoyed every nuance.

06:15.576 --> 06:17.545
Oh, well, thank you,
I guess I'm a method actor.

06:17.578 --> 06:19.880
-(laughs): Yeah.
-Hey, what are you,
on your lunch break,

06:19.913 --> 06:21.715
or you just love TED Talks
for ten-year-olds?

06:21.749 --> 06:22.916
Are you kidding me?

06:22.950 --> 06:24.217
These tickets are harder to get

06:24.251 --> 06:26.186
-than Hamilton.
-(chuckles)

06:26.219 --> 06:28.021
-Will I see you later?
-Absolutely, you will.

06:28.055 --> 06:29.957
-Ooh.
-All right, baby.

06:29.990 --> 06:31.191
KYLE:
I still can't believe

06:31.224 --> 06:32.593
your new dad's the captain.

06:32.626 --> 06:35.028
-That's so cool.
-He's pretty badass.

06:35.062 --> 06:36.764
Not just with,
like, fires and stuff.

06:36.797 --> 06:39.232
Like, during the earthquake, he
saved, like, hundreds of people.

06:39.266 --> 06:41.435
All we did was hand out
bottled waters.

06:45.906 --> 06:47.875
(siren wailing)

06:47.908 --> 06:50.177
(phone ringing)

06:51.612 --> 06:54.147
MADDIE:
911. What is your emergency?

06:54.181 --> 06:57.150
No, ma'am, an ice bath will not
help you break the baby's fever.

06:57.184 --> 06:59.587
-WOMAN: A steam shower?
-Steam shower's
not good, either.

06:59.620 --> 07:00.988
It's only gonna
raise her temperature.

07:01.021 --> 07:02.422
-Tell me your baby's name.
-Jessalyn.

07:02.456 --> 07:04.424
She's at 103.

07:04.458 --> 07:06.259
103 is high,
but not in the danger zone.

07:06.293 --> 07:07.728
Is Jessalyn eating
and producing urine?

07:07.761 --> 07:09.763
-Mm-hmm.
-Then she's gonna be fine.

07:09.797 --> 07:12.299
If the fever's there in an hour,
take her to the ER.

07:12.332 --> 07:14.067
Oh, thank God. Thank you.

07:14.101 --> 07:16.236
You're welcome.

07:16.269 --> 07:18.772
-911. What is your emergency?
-WOMAN 2: My husband.

07:18.806 --> 07:21.408
-He's choking on a shrimp tail.
-Y-You're gonna want
to get your hands

07:21.441 --> 07:23.110
under his sternum
and squeeze as you lift.

07:23.143 --> 07:25.112
-(woman 2 grunting)
-(man coughing)

07:25.145 --> 07:27.515
-It worked!
-Oh.

07:27.548 --> 07:29.349
I'm so glad.
Last thing your husband needed

07:29.382 --> 07:31.151
was a shrimp tail
stuck in his throat.

07:31.184 --> 07:32.620
(cell phone vibrating)

07:41.729 --> 07:43.631
Look me in the eye.

07:43.664 --> 07:45.198
What?

07:45.232 --> 07:46.867
-I'm checking on you.
-Ugh.

07:46.900 --> 07:47.968
Everyone is checking on me.

07:48.001 --> 07:49.336
I would tell you that I'm fine,

07:49.369 --> 07:50.671
but you probably
won't believe me, either.

07:50.704 --> 07:53.173
-How's Chimney?
-He's good.

07:53.206 --> 07:55.042
We're gonna finish
what we started.

07:55.075 --> 07:57.645
Oh, the-the first date
that we never had.

07:57.678 --> 07:59.046
Hope you have a good plan

07:59.079 --> 08:01.048
for the man
that almost died for you.

08:01.081 --> 08:02.550
Still working on it.

08:02.583 --> 08:03.817
I'll think of some
recommendations

08:03.851 --> 08:05.385
-while I'm saving lives.
-(chuckles)

08:05.418 --> 08:07.020
(phone ringing)

08:07.054 --> 08:09.189
-911. What's your emergency?
-MAN: I need help.

08:09.222 --> 08:10.858
Brakes gave out on my truck.

08:10.891 --> 08:12.960
-I had to use a turnout.
-Have you been hurt?

08:12.993 --> 08:14.562
Pretty sure
my ankle's broken.

08:14.595 --> 08:17.130
And I've made
a hell of a mess of things.

08:17.164 --> 08:19.066
I'm at Kanan, near the PCH.

08:19.099 --> 08:21.068
Don't worry, sir. I'm sending
you help right away.

08:21.101 --> 08:23.671
(crackling, beeping)

08:23.704 --> 08:24.972
Sir?

08:25.005 --> 08:27.741
Sir, can you hear me?

08:27.775 --> 08:29.409
(electronic crackling)

08:29.442 --> 08:30.678
(indistinct muttering)

08:39.720 --> 08:41.354
-(beeping)
-SUE: It's a level three outage.

08:41.388 --> 08:44.191
The power is on, but the entire
CAD system is down.

08:44.224 --> 08:47.027
The digital phone lines are
routed through the network,

08:47.060 --> 08:48.528
so no computers, no calls.

08:48.562 --> 08:51.364
But the analog lines still work.

08:51.398 --> 08:54.167
We're going old-school.
Red for fire,

08:54.201 --> 08:57.404
white for police,
yellow for medical.

08:57.437 --> 08:59.272
Write down important details,
figure out

08:59.306 --> 09:01.675
what resources you need,
use the walkie to dispatch

09:01.709 --> 09:03.410
resources to the scene.

09:03.443 --> 09:06.246
There are no blinking lights
on the map.

09:06.279 --> 09:09.783
So, from your caller,
get cross streets and landmarks.

09:09.817 --> 09:12.786
And if you are unfamiliar with
where they are calling from,

09:12.820 --> 09:14.354
look it up.

09:14.387 --> 09:16.356
(alarm ringing)

09:16.389 --> 09:19.793
Okay, everybody, we are in
Tactical Emergency Mode.

09:19.827 --> 09:21.962
That means we will not be
at the station today.

09:21.995 --> 09:24.297
We will be driving all around
the district to make sure

09:24.331 --> 09:26.366
that we are ready for anything
that comes our way.

09:26.399 --> 09:28.035
Cap, you do realize
we work here, right?

09:28.068 --> 09:29.569
We're trained professionals,
not fifth-graders.

09:29.603 --> 09:32.072
-Yeah, right?
-Sorry.

09:32.105 --> 09:34.574
This is a street atlas.

09:34.608 --> 09:37.410
All of Los Angeles
in one handy volume.

09:37.444 --> 09:41.281
Maps on paper, people.
And yes, they still make them.

09:41.314 --> 09:44.885
Street numbers are located on
the maps and also in the index.

09:44.918 --> 09:47.655
EDDIE:
Hey, Cap. You ever seen
a breakdown like this before?

09:47.688 --> 09:49.289
Once in St. Paul.

09:49.322 --> 09:51.491
Blizzard took out the power grid
around the call center

09:51.524 --> 09:52.993
and backup generator.

09:53.026 --> 09:54.828
I've been through, like,
three of these.

09:54.862 --> 09:56.630
I'm surprised
they don't happen more often,

09:56.664 --> 09:58.298
the way the city funds us.

09:58.331 --> 10:00.668
Department's held together
by chewing gum and spit.

10:00.701 --> 10:03.070
Hey, come on,
I like these old trucks.

10:03.103 --> 10:05.105
Uh-huh. I like them
when they run.

10:05.138 --> 10:06.740
JOSH:
It will be chaos.

10:06.774 --> 10:08.141
Help each other through it.

10:08.175 --> 10:09.977
Call out errors,
correct mistakes.

10:10.010 --> 10:11.611
See it, say it, repeat it.

10:11.645 --> 10:13.613
We did it this way for 20 years.

10:13.647 --> 10:16.183
We'll do it again today.

10:16.216 --> 10:18.919
JOSH (over radio):
118 Engine and Rescue,
please report your location.

10:18.952 --> 10:20.921
BOBBY:
We're on Granville, approaching
Miracle Mile District

10:20.954 --> 10:22.522
from the west.

10:22.555 --> 10:24.591
JOSH:
Please proceed
to 9590 Hillcrest.

10:24.624 --> 10:26.626
Cross street is Meadows.

10:26.660 --> 10:30.330
Vehicle collided with
a 58-year-old cyclist, male.

10:30.363 --> 10:33.000
Copy.
118, Battalion Seven en route.

10:35.368 --> 10:37.104
So, you didn't do it there,
where did you do it?

10:37.137 --> 10:38.672
(news fanfare playing)

10:38.706 --> 10:40.207
-Good morning, everybody.
-Oh, come on.

10:40.240 --> 10:42.175
We're learning
that Metro L.A.'s 911 system

10:42.209 --> 10:43.811
has been hit
with a system-wide outage.

10:43.844 --> 10:45.946
We're gonna be posting
alternate numbers.

10:45.979 --> 10:47.347
We'll put them
on the screen here

10:47.380 --> 10:49.116
for you and on our website.

10:49.149 --> 10:51.985
Department staffers are also
monitoring social media

10:52.019 --> 10:55.856
and urging you to use
the hashtag "911-L.A."

10:55.889 --> 10:57.858
Now, officials are saying
that only about 30%

10:57.891 --> 10:59.559
of these emergency calls
are gonna be able

10:59.592 --> 11:01.228
to get through,
so please only call 911...

11:01.261 --> 11:03.296
Okay, this might be
a better show.

11:03.330 --> 11:05.165
...if it is a life-threatening
emergency.

11:05.198 --> 11:08.568
* That's great, it starts
with an earthquake *

11:08.601 --> 11:11.138
* Birds and snakes
and aeroplanes *

11:11.171 --> 11:13.673
* And Lenny Bruce
is not afraid *

11:13.707 --> 11:16.409
* Eye of a hurricane,
listen to yourself churn *

11:16.443 --> 11:17.811
* World serves
its own needs... *

11:17.845 --> 11:20.513
Get these cars routed
around the scene

11:20.547 --> 11:22.649
and shut down these two lanes.

11:22.682 --> 11:24.251
* With a fear of height,
down, height... *

11:24.284 --> 11:28.421
Dispatch, this is 118.
122 is already on the scene.

11:28.455 --> 11:30.758
JOSH:
Copy that.
Maintain Emergency Protocol.

11:30.791 --> 11:32.492
* With the Furies breathing
down your neck... *

11:32.525 --> 11:34.494
BOBBY:
Copy that. 118 on the move.

11:34.527 --> 11:36.830
Wait, is that the vehicle
versus cyclist on Hillcrest?

11:36.864 --> 11:38.598
I sent the 122. I'm sorry.

11:38.631 --> 11:41.668
It's okay. It's gonna happen.
Um, Vicky, Jeanette, Andre,

11:41.701 --> 11:44.671
start walking the floor
and flag all duplicate calls.

11:44.704 --> 11:47.775
Make sure one ends up
on the boards. Got it?

11:47.808 --> 11:49.843
Sure you don't want to take
another three weeks off?

11:49.877 --> 11:51.278
Yeah.

11:58.118 --> 12:01.188
I'm sorry, but we're not giving
any tours today.

12:01.221 --> 12:04.524
You should return your passes to
the receptionist and reschedule.

12:04.557 --> 12:07.761
MAN:
Don't think my ASAC
will like that.

12:09.129 --> 12:12.432
(scoffs) You're FBI?

12:12.465 --> 12:14.267
Anders is our data breach
and recovery expert.

12:14.301 --> 12:16.937
Nina is a critical
infrastructure specialist.

12:16.970 --> 12:19.639
I'm Devon, systems analyst,
cyberterrorism.

12:19.672 --> 12:21.274
So you think we've been hacked?

12:21.308 --> 12:22.575
We're operating
on that assumption.

12:22.609 --> 12:24.444
ANDERS:
Doesn't take much. In 2016,

12:24.477 --> 12:26.579
a single web address
went viral on Twitter.

12:26.613 --> 12:27.948
People clicked on it,

12:27.981 --> 12:30.050
and their phones started
speed-dialing 911.

12:30.083 --> 12:31.551
DEVON:
The attack in Atlanta last year

12:31.584 --> 12:33.653
was traced back
to Russian hackers.

12:33.686 --> 12:35.655
The city spent
more than $2.6 million

12:35.688 --> 12:37.224
trying to unlock their systems,

12:37.257 --> 12:38.792
rather than pay
the ransom demand

12:38.826 --> 12:40.894
of $50,000 in Bitcoin.

12:40.928 --> 12:42.662
-Ransom demand?
-Yes.

12:42.695 --> 12:44.497
And that's what
we're hoping for,

12:44.531 --> 12:48.001
because the moment they hit us
with it, we'll be ready.

12:51.972 --> 12:54.741
-(elevator bell dings)
-(sighing): Okay, okay.

12:54.774 --> 12:56.343
(strained grunting)

12:56.376 --> 12:58.111
-Is it bad?
-(chuckles)

12:58.145 --> 12:59.579
Please tell me it's not bad.

12:59.612 --> 13:02.916
On a scale of one to ten,
it's about a 40.

13:02.950 --> 13:04.517
-We're not gonna make it.
-Ooh!

13:04.551 --> 13:07.020
We'll be fine, Roger.
We just got to get to the car...

13:07.054 --> 13:08.588
-Aah!
-Whoa.

13:08.621 --> 13:10.757
-Did your water just break?
-Yeah.

13:10.790 --> 13:12.525
Yeah, broke.

13:12.559 --> 13:14.261
Okay, all right.

13:14.294 --> 13:15.929
-Okay.
-Ooh!

13:15.963 --> 13:18.698
-Call 911. (yells)
-We've got an Uber on the way.

13:18.731 --> 13:21.668
O-Okay, okay.

13:21.701 --> 13:23.436
-(cell phone dialing)
-AUTOMATED VOICE:
You have reached a number

13:23.470 --> 13:24.804
that is not in service.

13:24.838 --> 13:26.173
What do you mean,
it's not in service?

13:26.206 --> 13:29.809
How is 911 not in service?
(panting)

13:29.843 --> 13:32.279
-(line ringing)
-Thank God.

13:32.312 --> 13:34.014
LINDA:
911. What's your emergency?

13:34.047 --> 13:35.648
Yeah, my wife is having a baby.

13:35.682 --> 13:38.018
Engine 118, Rescue 118,

13:38.051 --> 13:40.954
report to 550 San Vicente.

13:40.988 --> 13:43.523
Woman in labor,
geriatric pregnancy,

13:43.556 --> 13:45.358
contractions very close.

13:45.392 --> 13:46.559
BOBBY:
Copy that.

13:46.593 --> 13:49.562
118 en route to 550 San Vicente.

13:49.596 --> 13:51.731
(sirens wailing)

13:53.766 --> 13:55.768
(Sonia shouting)

13:57.437 --> 13:59.006
Need some pillows?

13:59.039 --> 14:00.874
The contractions are right
on top of each other.

14:00.908 --> 14:02.709
-This is not good.
-(screaming)

14:07.214 --> 14:08.381
It's okay. I got it.

14:08.415 --> 14:10.017
Where the hell is the ambulance?

14:10.050 --> 14:11.284
(sirens wailing)

14:20.793 --> 14:22.595
Dispatch, this is 118.

14:22.629 --> 14:25.732
-There is nothing here.
-No pregnant woman?

14:25.765 --> 14:27.734
There's no building.
It's an empty lot.

14:27.767 --> 14:29.136
LINDA:
Stand by, 118.

14:34.774 --> 14:37.377
Hey, Linda,
did you say San Vicente?

14:37.410 --> 14:40.513
Yeah. Woman in labor
in the lobby of a high-rise.

14:40.547 --> 14:43.750
Yeah, it's the wrong
San Vicente. There's three.

14:43.783 --> 14:46.286
118, you're gonna need
to proceed

14:46.319 --> 14:49.923
to San Vicente, east of
the Miracle Mile District.

14:49.957 --> 14:52.960
Nearest cross street is Sixth.

14:52.993 --> 14:54.227
BOBBY:
Copy that.

15:03.236 --> 15:04.704
He's ready.

15:04.737 --> 15:06.139
I know, honey, I know.

15:06.173 --> 15:08.275
-He wants out!
-It's okay.

15:08.308 --> 15:09.776
It's gonna be okay.

15:12.112 --> 15:13.580
Where the hell
have you guys been?

15:13.613 --> 15:15.082
We are fighting
a system outage, sir.

15:15.115 --> 15:16.950
We apologize for the delay.
Hen, you're up.

15:16.984 --> 15:18.485
-Eddie, start fluids.
-(stammering)

15:18.518 --> 15:20.053
We can't just have
the baby here in the lobby.

15:20.087 --> 15:21.388
That's not how this is
supposed to happen.

15:21.421 --> 15:23.890
Roger, this is
pretty much the way

15:23.923 --> 15:27.327
it's happened throughout
human his...tory. (groans)

15:27.360 --> 15:30.897
Hi. I'm Hen. What's your name?

15:30.930 --> 15:33.900
(panting):
Sonia. 39 weeks pregnant.

15:33.933 --> 15:38.838
38 years old, which makes me
a geriatric pregnancy.

15:38.871 --> 15:41.841
-God, I hate that word.
-Word doesn't matter.

15:41.874 --> 15:43.476
You're still gonna
get a baby out of it.

15:43.510 --> 15:46.779
I can't believe I'm finally
gonna meet him. Here.

15:46.813 --> 15:48.348
In the lobby. (laughs)

15:48.381 --> 15:51.151
That's all right.
You're doing great, okay?

15:51.184 --> 15:54.754
Now, on this next contraction,
we're gonna push, okay, Sonia?

15:54.787 --> 15:58.458
(groaning)

15:58.491 --> 16:00.960
Sonia? Sonia?

16:00.994 --> 16:03.430
There's something wrong
with the baby.

16:03.463 --> 16:05.498
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Your baby's fine.

16:05.532 --> 16:08.535
-You'll-you'll be able to see
for yourself in just a minute.
-No!

16:08.568 --> 16:10.037
No, this was a mistake.

16:10.070 --> 16:12.505
All of it.

16:12.539 --> 16:14.707
Roger was right to panic.
Look, we can't do this.

16:14.741 --> 16:19.012
I can't... I can't do this.
I shouldn't have this child.

16:19.046 --> 16:21.348
No, no, no. No, no, no, no.
Sonia, look at me.

16:21.381 --> 16:22.849
Sonia, look at me,
look at me, look at me.

16:22.882 --> 16:24.717
Look at me, look at me.

16:24.751 --> 16:27.287
All you got to do is push.

16:27.320 --> 16:30.157
All you need to do, push.

16:31.558 --> 16:33.560
Push.

Good, good, good. Keep pushing!

Keep pushing!

16:48.075 --> 16:49.476
He's here!

16:49.509 --> 16:51.178
-He's here!
-(applause)

16:57.084 --> 16:59.886
Yeah. Yes.

16:59.919 --> 17:01.854
Baby's got a set of pipes.

17:01.888 --> 17:06.593
We're gonna take you
to the warmest place

17:06.626 --> 17:10.263

-Roger, Roger. Hey, hey, hey.

17:23.143 --> 17:24.777
Listen, she is in good hands.

17:24.811 --> 17:26.413
Okay? Right now, he needs yours.

17:30.417 --> 17:32.285
Blood pressure went off a cliff.

17:32.319 --> 17:33.953
HEN:
Sonia, can you hear me?

17:33.986 --> 17:36.756
-Cyanosis.
-(baby continues crying)

17:36.789 --> 17:38.758
Can someone please tell me
what's happening here?

17:38.791 --> 17:40.793
BUCK:
Your wife has gone into shock.

17:42.229 --> 17:43.396
I lost her pulse.

17:43.430 --> 17:44.697
HEN:
She's in cardiac arrest.

17:44.731 --> 17:45.965
I'm starting compressions.

17:45.998 --> 17:47.100
BOBBY:
Okay, let's get her transported

17:47.134 --> 17:49.035
to L.A. General now.

17:49.068 --> 17:51.238
Hey, Cap, we're gonna need
another ambulance for the baby.

17:52.472 --> 17:54.441
Dispatch, this is Engine 118.

17:54.474 --> 17:56.209
DISPATCH:
Stand by, 118.

17:56.243 --> 18:00.113
No more standing by. Guys, let's
get her on the gurney. Let's go.

18:14.161 --> 18:16.062
-Hen, let me take over.
-No, I got it.

18:16.095 --> 18:18.298
She's not dying
because somebody blew a fuse.

Come on, Sonia.
I know you're a fighter.

18:19.866 --> 18:21.334
BOBBY:
She is. She was. She was fine

18:21.368 --> 18:22.735
when we got there, and then...

18:22.769 --> 18:25.638
Sudden despair
and fear and anxiety.

18:25.672 --> 18:27.840
BOBBY:
Birth was going like clockwork,
even for a geriatric pregnancy.

18:27.874 --> 18:30.143
Then rapid loss of BP.

18:32.145 --> 18:33.946
Amniotic embolism, Cap.

18:33.980 --> 18:36.183
She's hemorrhaging.

18:36.216 --> 18:38.151
The hospital needs
to prep for this.

18:38.185 --> 18:39.952
It's a massive
transfusion protocol.

18:39.986 --> 18:42.489
BOBBY:
Well, we can't radio,

(monitor flatlining)

19:42.582 --> 19:45.252
-How is she?
-Guys.

19:45.285 --> 19:47.153
What's wrong?

19:47.186 --> 19:49.356
I am so sorry.

20:03.870 --> 20:05.938
You were right.

20:05.972 --> 20:08.608
He's perfect.

20:08.641 --> 20:11.578
I wish you could see him.

20:11.611 --> 20:14.247
I know I was scared

20:14.281 --> 20:16.783
and worried that
we weren't ready for this,

20:16.816 --> 20:18.918
and I am damn sure

20:18.951 --> 20:23.089
not ready to do this
without you,

20:23.122 --> 20:25.124
but I will.

20:25.157 --> 20:28.127
I'm gonna figure it out.

20:28.160 --> 20:30.162
(baby cooing)

20:45.678 --> 20:48.114
-(baby fusses)
-(monitor beeping)

20:52.018 --> 20:53.820
(baby crying)

20:53.853 --> 20:55.455
She's got a pulse.

20:55.488 --> 20:57.490
-Go, go! Get her inside!
-Let's go.
-Watch the left.

20:57.524 --> 20:59.626
-Hallway's good.
-All right.

20:59.659 --> 21:01.661
(indistinct chatter)

21:04.030 --> 21:05.432
Thank you.

21:05.465 --> 21:07.467
(gasping)

21:09.636 --> 21:13.139
That was amazing.

21:13.172 --> 21:15.274
That was a miracle.

21:27.620 --> 21:29.255
-Right there.
-That's not what
I'm looking for.

21:29.288 --> 21:32.258
Okay. Uh, right here.
Great little Tuscan spot.

21:32.291 --> 21:33.926
Has a garden
that's not really a garden,

21:33.960 --> 21:35.595
so you still feel like
you're sitting outside.

21:35.628 --> 21:37.296
Also, string lights.

21:37.330 --> 21:39.198
-Mm, that sounds intimate.
-I thought you wanted intimate.

21:39.231 --> 21:40.867
No, I want special.

21:40.900 --> 21:43.135
Rachel McAdams special
or Reese Witherspoon special?

21:43.169 --> 21:45.271
I don't think that
I know the difference.

21:45.304 --> 21:47.139
Fun and flighty
or serious and heartfelt?

21:47.173 --> 21:50.377
-No, I don't want serious.
-Oh. Then what do you want?

21:50.410 --> 21:52.979
TERRY:
I've already run every
antivirus protocol we have.

21:53.012 --> 21:55.114
ANDERS:
Did you scan
for foreign data packets?

21:55.147 --> 21:57.617
-Every scan turns up zero.
-Well, that's not surprising.

21:57.650 --> 22:00.186
Some of these cyber-thugs
can be pretty sophisticated.

22:00.219 --> 22:01.888
Pretty sure,
if it were a malware attack,

22:01.921 --> 22:03.390
I would have found it by now.

22:03.423 --> 22:04.991
(exhales)

22:06.426 --> 22:08.395
(clears throat)

22:08.428 --> 22:09.696
Mister...?

22:09.729 --> 22:11.798
Flores, Terry.

22:11.831 --> 22:14.401
Mr. Flores.

22:14.434 --> 22:16.403
I'm sure you're very good
at your job.

22:16.436 --> 22:19.071
But this goes beyond
tech support.

22:19.105 --> 22:21.408
Now, please.

22:21.441 --> 22:23.810
Let us do what we do.

22:23.843 --> 22:25.845
Sure.

22:28.347 --> 22:30.316
Hey, what's that?

22:30.349 --> 22:32.251
It's electrical fire.

22:32.284 --> 22:34.454
Eleventh and Margo,
low-priority call.

22:37.757 --> 22:40.092
Eleventh and Margo.

22:42.895 --> 22:44.531
Okay, let's refuel.

22:44.564 --> 22:46.032
We're back out there
in five minutes.

22:46.065 --> 22:48.034
Hen, can you check
the ambulance and top off

22:48.067 --> 22:50.102
-anything that needs resupply?
-Copy that, Cap.

22:50.136 --> 22:52.439
Thank you.

22:52.472 --> 22:54.441
(faint chatter)

22:54.474 --> 22:55.875
Harry?

23:01.581 --> 23:03.616
Harry.

23:03.650 --> 23:05.585
What're you doing here?

23:05.618 --> 23:07.219
Where's your dad?

23:07.253 --> 23:09.055
We had a fight. He was so mad.

23:09.088 --> 23:10.523
Then I ran away.

23:10.557 --> 23:11.791
He doesn't know you're here?

23:13.225 --> 23:15.194
(softly):
Okay.

23:15.227 --> 23:17.196
No, you can't call him.

23:17.229 --> 23:19.065
Harry, your dad's gonna be
worried sick about you.

23:19.098 --> 23:20.733
I got to let him know
you're okay.

23:20.767 --> 23:22.802
No, you don't understand.
He was really mad.

23:22.835 --> 23:24.471
There you are.

23:24.504 --> 23:26.573
-How did you find me?
-Next time, don't tweet

23:26.606 --> 23:28.641
from your secret location.

23:28.675 --> 23:30.276
Get in the car.

23:38.084 --> 23:40.687
Michael, I was gonna call you.
We'd just gotten back.

23:42.689 --> 23:45.324
Michael. Michael.

23:45.357 --> 23:48.628
I don't know what you two
had a fight about,

23:48.661 --> 23:50.630
but Harry seemed real shook up.

23:50.663 --> 23:52.064
Bobby...

23:52.098 --> 23:53.966
do I strike you
as the type of man

23:54.000 --> 23:56.068
that has fights
with his ten-year-old son?

23:56.102 --> 23:58.304
-No, I...
-Well, then let me fill you in

23:58.337 --> 24:00.306
on actually what happened.

24:00.339 --> 24:03.142
Harry was playing
with his friend Kyle.

24:03.175 --> 24:05.011
On Kyle's front lawn.

24:05.044 --> 24:07.647
They decided
that it would be fun

24:07.680 --> 24:11.283
to set a fire
and then try to put it out.

24:11.317 --> 24:13.753
Because fighting fires
is so cool.

24:13.786 --> 24:16.455
Oh, God. I... Is everybody okay?

24:16.489 --> 24:19.325
Yeah, the kids are fine.
The yard, not so much.

24:19.358 --> 24:21.494
But I don't think I need
to tell you the ways in which

24:21.528 --> 24:23.362
that could have gone
horribly wrong.

24:23.395 --> 24:24.864
No, I cannot believe
that Harry would do that.

24:24.897 --> 24:26.866
-I will talk to him.
-You will not.

24:26.899 --> 24:28.835
I'll talk to him.
That's my job, not yours.

24:28.868 --> 24:30.269
You've done enough.

24:30.302 --> 24:31.871
What the hell is that
supposed to mean?

24:31.904 --> 24:33.372
Excuse me?

24:33.405 --> 24:34.941
Let me tell you something--
I don't like

24:34.974 --> 24:36.208
what's happening to my son.

24:36.242 --> 24:38.444
He used to care about
video games

24:38.477 --> 24:40.947
and sports and-and comic books.

24:40.980 --> 24:43.215
And ever since you came along,
the big damn hero,

24:43.249 --> 24:45.317
making him feel like
your kind of life

24:45.351 --> 24:47.486
is the only one worth having.

24:47.520 --> 24:50.122
Filling his head
with reckless ideas.

24:50.156 --> 24:51.858
What we do here is not reckless.

24:51.891 --> 24:54.393
Might be difficult to understand
when you've never done the job.

24:54.426 --> 24:57.329
I get it, Bobby.

24:57.363 --> 24:59.866
You're awesome.
More awesome than me.

24:59.899 --> 25:01.868
But hear me on this:

25:01.901 --> 25:04.837
I am not interested
in raising my son

25:04.871 --> 25:07.239
-in your image.
-That is not what I'm doing.

25:07.273 --> 25:09.709
-I'm just trying
to be there for Harry.
-Because I'm not?

25:09.742 --> 25:12.144
I'm only with him
half the time now, right?

25:12.178 --> 25:14.847
Maybe that makes me
half a father.

25:14.881 --> 25:17.016
It's still half more than you.

25:25.558 --> 25:27.760
GPS VOICE:
In .2 miles, turn right.

25:27.794 --> 25:29.028
Then make another right.

25:29.061 --> 25:30.830
That is the fourth right
in a row!

25:30.863 --> 25:32.665
The freaking nav is sending me
in a circle.

25:32.699 --> 25:34.834
What is going on today?

25:34.867 --> 25:37.436
WOMAN:
That's what I'm telling you.
911 is out. Totally gone.

25:37.469 --> 25:39.171
Accidents everywhere.
Traffic's going crazy.

25:39.205 --> 25:42.341
Oh, so it's a day that ends
in "Y" in L.A.

25:42.374 --> 25:45.878
(gasps) What the...

25:45.912 --> 25:48.581
-(explosion)
-(screams)
-(tires screech)

25:48.615 --> 25:52.084
(horn blaring)

25:52.118 --> 25:54.353
(coughing)

25:54.386 --> 25:55.755
DAVID:
Alex!

25:55.788 --> 25:57.657
-Alex!
-(car alarms blaring)

26:11.337 --> 26:13.272
DWIGHT: This is a live picture
from Newscopter Eight.

26:13.305 --> 26:15.307
We're over Doheny Park there,
and it's been hit by

26:15.341 --> 26:17.209
multiple explosions.
Now, we're not sure what's

26:17.243 --> 26:19.612
causing these explosions,
and we're still waiting

26:19.646 --> 26:22.615
for the first responders
to arrive at the scene.

26:22.649 --> 26:24.617
We are getting reports
from bystanders, though,

26:24.651 --> 26:26.585
-that some residents
were at home...
-(line ringing)

26:26.619 --> 26:28.120
Yeah, Buck.
Where are you guys?

26:28.154 --> 26:30.389
Uh, we are crossing Robertson

26:30.422 --> 26:32.959
for the 320th time.

26:32.992 --> 26:34.727
Get over to Doheny Park, man.

26:34.761 --> 26:36.228
The whole damn
neighborhood's on fire.

26:36.262 --> 26:37.897
Looks like it's
a gas main break.

26:37.930 --> 26:39.331
You heard it on the scanner?

26:39.365 --> 26:40.667
No, I'm watching it
on the news right now.

26:40.700 --> 26:41.801
Nobody's over there, Buck.

26:41.834 --> 26:43.402
Not a single unit.

26:43.435 --> 26:46.505
Hey, Cap! Uh, Doheny Park
is going up in flames!

26:46.538 --> 26:48.274
Chim thinks it's
a gas main break.

26:48.307 --> 26:51.177
-We're close, right?
-Close enough. Let's do it.

26:51.210 --> 26:52.645
(siren blaring)

26:58.785 --> 27:00.086
(indistinct chatter)

27:00.119 --> 27:01.854
BOBBY:
Dispatch, this is Captain 118.

27:01.888 --> 27:03.589
We're at Doheny Park.

27:03.622 --> 27:04.991
Multiple residential
structure fires.

27:05.024 --> 27:06.258
Send everything you can.

27:06.292 --> 27:08.427
JOSH:
Copy that, 118.

27:08.460 --> 27:10.697
I'm trying to find
additional resources for you,

27:10.730 --> 27:13.265
but you might be on your own
for the next 15,

27:13.299 --> 27:16.035
-maybe 20 minutes.
-BOBBY: Copy that.

27:16.068 --> 27:19.138
(siren wailing)

27:19.171 --> 27:22.675
-Help! Help! You got to help!
-Cap!

27:22.709 --> 27:24.143
My son! He's trapped upstairs!

27:24.176 --> 27:25.712
Do you know where?
Which room?

27:25.745 --> 27:26.879
No, no, I haven't seen him.

27:27.880 --> 27:29.315
Cap, I see him! Upstairs window!

27:29.348 --> 27:33.219
-(yells)
-Sir! Sir! Two!

27:33.252 --> 27:34.854
-All right, get the ladder
up to the house. Go.
-All right.

27:34.887 --> 27:35.988
I'll check the driver, Cap!

27:36.022 --> 27:37.356
-Louis.
-Go for Louis.

27:37.389 --> 27:38.624
-Jones.
-Yeah, Cap.

27:38.657 --> 27:40.459
Go door to door.
Everyone gets evacuated.

27:40.492 --> 27:42.628
Hen is doing triage.

27:42.661 --> 27:44.363
-DAVID: You got to save him!
-BOBBY: Sir, just let us work.

27:44.396 --> 27:45.998
-Cap!
-Yeah?

27:46.032 --> 27:48.500
Hydrant's gone. The only water
we got is in the truck.

27:48.534 --> 27:50.970
-It's not even enough
to put out one house.
-Okay.

27:51.003 --> 27:52.471
Keep trying dispatch.

27:52.504 --> 27:54.640
Gas company needs
to shut down Doheny Park.

27:54.673 --> 27:56.575
I want a two-mile radius
around Lambourne Place.

27:56.608 --> 27:58.377
-Two miles.
-Copy that.

27:59.746 --> 28:01.981
(sighs)
Okay, okay.

28:02.014 --> 28:05.251
Uh... there's no water.
They got no backup.

28:05.284 --> 28:07.086
NEWSCASTER:
Looks like they hit a pipe.
And just thinking ahead...

28:07.119 --> 28:09.088
-Backup.
-...it could be a huge problem

28:09.121 --> 28:10.990
for first responders
to deal with

28:11.023 --> 28:12.825
-when they arrive here
at the scene.
-(line ringing)

28:12.859 --> 28:14.693
That's the only hydrant
out there on the street...

28:14.727 --> 28:16.162
-MAN: Hello?
-Hey, Tommy.

28:16.195 --> 28:17.429
-Hey, man.
-Yeah, it's me, Howie.

28:17.463 --> 28:19.431
Are you still with the 217?

28:19.465 --> 28:21.433
(screaming, frantic chatter)

28:25.437 --> 28:27.206
(coughing)

28:31.277 --> 28:32.244
Dad!

28:32.278 --> 28:34.213
I'm over here!
Help!

28:35.581 --> 28:36.682
Dad!

28:36.715 --> 28:38.384
BUCK:
We got you, big guy.

28:38.417 --> 28:39.685
Help!

28:39.718 --> 28:41.353
I just need you
to hold on, okay?

28:41.387 --> 28:42.388
I'm coming for you.

28:43.823 --> 28:44.924
(coughing)

28:44.957 --> 28:46.458
Go, go, go!

28:47.659 --> 28:49.862
Almost there.

28:49.896 --> 28:51.730
I told you, everything's
gonna be fine.

28:52.832 --> 28:54.566
(metallic grinding)

28:54.600 --> 28:56.102
-No, no, no!
-(grunting)

28:56.135 --> 28:57.236
(gasps)

28:57.269 --> 28:58.370
Buck!

28:58.404 --> 28:59.638
-(grunts)
-ALEX: Help!

29:00.840 --> 29:02.108
(yells)

29:02.141 --> 29:03.442
(whooshing, clattering)

29:11.483 --> 29:12.751
-You all right?
-Yeah.

29:12.785 --> 29:14.086
Yeah, I'm good. Come on.

29:14.120 --> 29:15.487
Oh, hey, uh, Eddie.

29:15.521 --> 29:17.423
Eddie, what are you doing?

29:25.597 --> 29:29.135
I feel like, if I ever did that,
you would yell at me.

29:35.474 --> 29:36.809
WOMAN:
Get him out!

29:38.677 --> 29:41.047
(panting)

29:44.616 --> 29:46.986
(coughing)

29:52.791 --> 29:54.861
(grunting)

29:58.831 --> 30:00.532
-Alex!
-(flame whooshing)

30:00.566 --> 30:02.568
(coughing)

30:06.205 --> 30:08.074
Alex!

30:10.742 --> 30:12.811
Alex, where are you, buddy?

30:19.251 --> 30:21.620
(coughing)

30:21.653 --> 30:24.490
Uh, Cap, I got him.
Alive but unconscious.

30:24.523 --> 30:26.893
I'm prepping for evac.

30:26.926 --> 30:29.661
Cap, gas guys just showed up.
They're shutting it down.

30:29.695 --> 30:31.230
All neighbors are present
and accounted for.

30:31.263 --> 30:32.899
Two more engines are rolling in,

30:32.932 --> 30:35.134
but it makes no sense
if there's no water pressure.

30:35.167 --> 30:36.903
(explosive booming)

30:36.936 --> 30:39.338
-(creaking)
-(grunts)

30:39.371 --> 30:41.373
(gasping)

30:43.242 --> 30:44.343
Alex!

30:47.779 --> 30:50.349
(grunting)

30:50.382 --> 30:53.185
(coughing)

30:56.722 --> 30:58.557
(inhales deeply)

31:00.359 --> 31:02.394
Cap! Negative on evac.

31:02.428 --> 31:04.663
Pinned down,
south side of the house.

31:04.696 --> 31:06.598
I'm gonna take an extinguisher!

31:06.632 --> 31:09.401
If I can make that jump,
I can help Eddie!

31:11.103 --> 31:12.071
No, wait.

31:12.104 --> 31:15.774
(airplane engine roaring)

31:19.711 --> 31:21.213
Wait, is that...

31:29.121 --> 31:31.257
Incoming!
Everybody, take cover!

31:31.290 --> 31:33.725
Under the trucks now!
Now! Go, go!

31:33.759 --> 31:35.527
BOBBY:
Hunker down. 217 is inbound.

31:35.561 --> 31:37.029
Seriously?

31:37.063 --> 31:39.465
-(flame whooshes)
-(coughs, grunts)

31:44.303 --> 31:46.538
BOBBY:
Get under the trucks!
Under the trucks! Now!

31:46.572 --> 31:48.140
Under, under!

31:48.174 --> 31:50.542
-Here!
-Hurry! Run, run!

31:50.576 --> 31:52.244
(grunting)

31:56.015 --> 31:57.549
Go! Clear, clear, clear!

31:57.583 --> 32:00.219
Hen, Hen, Hen, Hen, Hen!
Hen, Hen, Hen!

32:00.252 --> 32:01.420
Stay down!

32:25.177 --> 32:27.179
*

32:37.323 --> 32:40.292
(gasping, grunting)

32:44.196 --> 32:46.865
Eddie, do you copy?

32:50.336 --> 32:52.071
(sirens approaching)

32:54.140 --> 32:56.175
Alex?

32:58.477 --> 33:00.379
(grunting, panting)

33:02.348 --> 33:03.982
(Alex coughing)

33:04.016 --> 33:05.384
Oh! Oh!

33:05.417 --> 33:07.886
Oh, thank God.

33:07.919 --> 33:09.855
Oh, you're... Hey, buddy.

33:09.888 --> 33:13.059
What's up with
the Spider-Man routine?

33:13.092 --> 33:15.294
I don't know.
I just did it.

33:15.327 --> 33:17.663
And prayed a lot.

33:17.696 --> 33:20.132
Yeah, it looks like
someone was listening.

33:20.166 --> 33:21.233
CHIMNEY:
Yes!

33:21.267 --> 33:24.036
You are welcome.
You are welcome.

33:24.070 --> 33:26.405
Ow. Ow.
(chuckles)

33:26.438 --> 33:30.442
REPORTER (on TV):
And a C130 supertanker
with Cal Fire coming in...

33:41.253 --> 33:42.721
SUE:
So, nothing?

33:42.754 --> 33:45.157
-Still?
-We'll keep digging.

33:45.191 --> 33:48.860
Well, drop the shovel.
The system's fine.

33:48.894 --> 33:50.396
MADDIE:
The electrical fire--

33:50.429 --> 33:52.864
11th and Margo,
low-priority call--

33:52.898 --> 33:55.067
wasn't so low-priority
after all.

33:55.101 --> 33:57.603
Something about the address
sounded familiar,

33:57.636 --> 33:59.705
so I asked Terry about it.

33:59.738 --> 34:01.840
It's where our communications
equipment lives.

34:01.873 --> 34:03.442
The backup generator
overheated.

34:03.475 --> 34:06.512
Knocked out the power,
took everything offline.

34:06.545 --> 34:09.781
No ransom, no revenge,
no terrorism.

34:09.815 --> 34:12.351
-It just...
-Broke.

34:12.384 --> 34:14.453
Never occurred to us to ask.

34:14.486 --> 34:15.854
(beeping)

34:15.887 --> 34:18.457
-MAN: Yes!
-(others cheer)

34:18.490 --> 34:20.759
We're back.

34:20.792 --> 34:23.929
(door opens, closes)

34:25.597 --> 34:27.299
Hey, baby.

34:27.333 --> 34:30.602
Do you know what happened
to the Andersons' front yard?

34:30.636 --> 34:33.539
Looks like it's burned
to a crisp.

34:33.572 --> 34:35.040
You should ask Harry.

34:35.073 --> 34:36.775
I wasn't home when it happened.

34:36.808 --> 34:38.444
Hmm.

34:38.477 --> 34:40.546
Hey, um, I heard 911 was down.

34:40.579 --> 34:42.248
That must have been crazy.

34:42.281 --> 34:45.251
Oh, yeah.
It was a trying day.

34:45.284 --> 34:47.386
I don't think I have it in me
to cook.

34:47.419 --> 34:50.456
-We should order something.
-Harry's already on it.

34:50.489 --> 34:52.758
HARRY:
Surprise, I'm making
dinner for you.

34:58.430 --> 35:02.067
ATHENA:
I see.

35:02.100 --> 35:04.002
Waffles. Your favorite.

35:05.036 --> 35:07.005
What did you do?

35:08.274 --> 35:11.009
(cell phone vibrating)

35:18.016 --> 35:20.018
I thought you were headed out.

35:20.051 --> 35:22.421
I didn't make a reservation.

35:22.454 --> 35:24.256
We talked about it all day,

35:24.290 --> 35:26.024
and I never picked
a damn restaurant.

35:26.057 --> 35:29.094
Well, you were a little busy.

35:29.127 --> 35:31.530
Or maybe you're not ready.

35:31.563 --> 35:34.366
(sighs)

35:34.400 --> 35:38.003
I just need to leave
what happened behind me.

35:38.036 --> 35:39.971
I'm never gonna be able
to move forward...

35:40.005 --> 35:41.440
You know, when people
break a leg,

35:41.473 --> 35:44.776
no one says,
"Hey, just walk it off."

35:44.810 --> 35:46.545
Because everybody knows
that ignoring an injury

35:46.578 --> 35:48.647
only compounds the damage.

35:48.680 --> 35:51.350
I'm not ignoring it.
I've been talking about it.

35:51.383 --> 35:54.853
And... dealing with it.

35:54.886 --> 35:58.290
But are you letting yourself
feel it?

35:58.324 --> 36:00.125
What you've been through
is a lot more complicated

36:00.158 --> 36:01.660
than a broken bone.

36:01.693 --> 36:03.061
But the advice is the same.

36:03.094 --> 36:05.631
Pretending you're not hurt,

36:05.664 --> 36:07.766
it's not the same thing
as healing.

36:15.607 --> 36:18.210
BOBBY:
There was no warning sign.
It just broke.

36:18.244 --> 36:20.712
-The worst possible moment.
-Eh, budget cuts.

36:20.746 --> 36:23.181
And the way we're going,
half the city is gonna be

36:23.215 --> 36:26.051
held together with paper clips
and duct tape.

36:26.084 --> 36:28.654
-Hen thinks it's
chewing gum and spit.
-(chuckles)

36:28.687 --> 36:31.357
Well, I'm afraid that
you're gonna be down a ladder

36:31.390 --> 36:33.191
for a few days.

36:33.225 --> 36:34.760
And I'll bring in a backup.

36:34.793 --> 36:37.596
But, you know,
there's a reason it's a backup.

36:37.629 --> 36:39.197
Paper clips and duct tape?

36:39.231 --> 36:40.666
I could throw in
some chewing gum

36:40.699 --> 36:42.067
if that'd make you feel better.

36:42.100 --> 36:43.769
Thanks, Marty.

36:43.802 --> 36:46.204
Yeah, well, still,
you got it done.

36:46.238 --> 36:48.840
Even with a bum ladder.

36:48.874 --> 36:50.609
That's not nothing.

36:50.642 --> 36:52.878
Equipment breaks, we don't.

36:52.911 --> 36:53.945
Now, that's a T-shirt.

36:57.148 --> 36:58.717
Hope it's not a bad time.

36:58.750 --> 37:01.119
Around here, that changes
by the minute.

37:02.321 --> 37:04.122
I thought we should talk.

37:04.155 --> 37:05.524
Sure.

37:05.557 --> 37:06.892
You want some coffee?

37:06.925 --> 37:08.727
There's pie.

37:08.760 --> 37:10.195
I'm sorry.

37:10.228 --> 37:11.963
I was out of line.

37:13.432 --> 37:16.034
I shouldn't have lost
my temper like that.

37:16.067 --> 37:17.903
Definitely not in here.

37:20.005 --> 37:23.709
Well, your timing was
maybe not ideal.

37:23.742 --> 37:26.645
All right, but listen,
if I'm overstepping...

37:26.678 --> 37:28.780
I'm sorry.
I will back off.

37:28.814 --> 37:30.716
Because the last thing
I want to do is

37:30.749 --> 37:32.217
get between a father
and his kids.

37:32.250 --> 37:35.454
And I know that, usually.

37:35.487 --> 37:39.391
But today, I overheard Harry
bragging about

37:39.425 --> 37:41.893
his cool new dad,
and I'm not gonna lie,

37:41.927 --> 37:43.495
it stung a little.

37:43.529 --> 37:45.731
Look, he's ten. I think
that he was just impressed

37:45.764 --> 37:47.799
by all the shiny trucks
and equipment.

37:47.833 --> 37:50.235
And I think, if you bring him
to a job site,

37:50.268 --> 37:51.970
show him a crane,
you'll be even cooler.

37:52.003 --> 37:54.005
Maybe.

37:54.039 --> 37:56.842
But he was mad at me today,

37:56.875 --> 37:58.844
and he ran here, to you.

38:00.111 --> 38:01.813
Well, I don't think
it's because

38:01.847 --> 38:04.316
he thinks of me as his dad.

38:06.017 --> 38:07.653
I think it's because I'm not.

38:07.686 --> 38:11.657
I'm not the guy who tells him
to finish his homework

38:11.690 --> 38:13.692
or grounds him because
he's done something wrong.

38:13.725 --> 38:16.595
I'm just Best Buddy Bobby,
nothing but fun.

38:16.628 --> 38:18.797
-(laughs)
-What?

38:18.830 --> 38:20.466
Really?
Is that how you see yourself?

38:20.499 --> 38:22.033
No, no.

38:22.067 --> 38:23.602
It's something
that Athena says to me,

38:23.635 --> 38:26.304
that I am always trying
to win them over,

38:26.338 --> 38:28.440
trying to be their friend,
not their stepparent.

38:28.474 --> 38:30.609
And she's right.

38:30.642 --> 38:34.480
I am... overcompensating.

38:34.513 --> 38:36.214
For what?

38:36.247 --> 38:38.417
For not being you.

38:40.652 --> 38:42.220
Wow.

38:42.253 --> 38:45.824
Well, I wouldn't get
too worked up over that,

38:45.857 --> 38:48.894
'cause I am definitely
no fun at all.

38:48.927 --> 38:51.229
I mean, ask Harry or Glenn.

38:51.262 --> 38:53.264
-It's just...
-I...

38:56.902 --> 38:58.404
We broke up.

38:58.437 --> 39:01.006
Are you sure you don't want
a piece of pie?

39:01.039 --> 39:02.307
Uh, maybe.

39:02.340 --> 39:03.675
-If there's ice cream.
-All right.

39:10.849 --> 39:13.284
-You get some ice cream.
-Yeah.

39:18.957 --> 39:22.728
I'm sorry about that.
It's just...

39:22.761 --> 39:25.196
Athena, she, uh...

39:25.230 --> 39:27.198
she didn't tell me.

39:27.232 --> 39:31.036
Well, Athena doesn't know.
Not yet.

39:31.069 --> 39:33.605
I-I've been trying to
figure out a way to tell her.

39:33.639 --> 39:36.007
"Remember the time
I blew up your life

39:36.041 --> 39:37.743
"and left you for somebody else?

39:37.776 --> 39:39.945
Well, whoops."

39:39.978 --> 39:43.214
Yeah, that's maybe not
the best way in.

39:43.248 --> 39:45.350
For the last three days,

39:45.383 --> 39:48.720
I have been feeling
like a damn fool, and-and...

39:48.754 --> 39:51.156
and then I started
acting like one.

39:52.791 --> 39:56.294
Well, that wasn't
my finest moment, either.

39:56.327 --> 39:58.263
You struck a nerve.

39:58.296 --> 40:02.133
The reason that I don't
put my foot down with your kids

40:02.167 --> 40:04.035
is that I'm always afraid
they're gonna tell me

40:04.069 --> 40:06.037
that I'm not their father.

40:06.071 --> 40:09.207
Because I'm not.

40:09.240 --> 40:11.076
I'm nobody's father.

40:13.679 --> 40:15.914
But you're about to become
a stepfather.

40:18.484 --> 40:22.588
So we have got to work
on your bad-cop routine.

40:22.621 --> 40:24.823
Present a united front,
all right,

40:24.856 --> 40:27.993
or they will divide
and conquer us for sure.

40:28.026 --> 40:29.127
All right, deal.

40:29.160 --> 40:31.597
Deal.

40:31.630 --> 40:33.799
Do you need to talk about...

40:33.832 --> 40:35.601
-No.
-Okay.

40:38.704 --> 40:41.239
Guess maybe next time, I should
pick the restaurant, huh?

40:41.272 --> 40:43.074
(laughs)
I'm so sorry.

40:43.108 --> 40:44.476
I meant to make a reservation.

40:44.510 --> 40:46.244
That's okay.
You had, like,

40:46.277 --> 40:48.847
a really crazy
first day back, so...

40:48.880 --> 40:52.784
Not as crazy as
my first day there, but yeah.

40:55.353 --> 40:57.523
So, I think it's supposed
to start raining tomorrow,

40:57.556 --> 40:58.957
probably through the weekend.

40:58.990 --> 41:00.659
That'd be nice.
(sighs)

41:00.692 --> 41:04.530
We could just stay at home
and catch up on some sleep.

41:04.563 --> 41:07.799
-You're not sleeping okay?
-No, I-I am.

41:09.234 --> 41:12.403
All I want to do is sleep.

41:14.806 --> 41:18.043
I just want to pull the covers
over my head

41:18.076 --> 41:20.679
and-and wait until
the world makes sense again.

41:21.847 --> 41:23.815
But I know that I can't do that.

41:23.849 --> 41:27.986
I have to get up and go to work

41:28.019 --> 41:30.421
and move forward.

41:31.489 --> 41:33.124
I'm not okay.

41:33.158 --> 41:35.360
Neither of us are.

41:35.393 --> 41:37.729
But I wanted to be.
I wanted, uh...

41:37.763 --> 41:39.230
I wanted this date
to be perfect

41:39.264 --> 41:41.132
to make up for the one
we didn't get.

41:41.166 --> 41:43.001
But I think that's asking
a little too much

41:43.034 --> 41:44.703
of a bowl of pasta.
(laughs)

41:44.736 --> 41:46.638
I hate my apartment building.

41:46.672 --> 41:51.242
I hate just walking
out of my front door.

41:51.276 --> 41:54.445
And I tried coming home,
because every time I...

41:56.715 --> 41:59.184
I just see you laying there.

42:01.620 --> 42:03.254
Yesterday,
I want to get my mail,

42:03.288 --> 42:05.256
and one of my neighbors
came up behind me,

42:05.290 --> 42:07.826
and I, uh... I'm really not sure

42:07.859 --> 42:10.228
which one of us
was freaked out more, me or him.

42:10.261 --> 42:12.230
(both laugh)

42:21.272 --> 42:23.541
This is never gonna
be the same, is it?

42:25.877 --> 42:29.581
Whatever it is that
we were about to have, or...

42:29.615 --> 42:31.917
We're never getting it back.

42:34.252 --> 42:35.787
(quietly):
No.

42:40.926 --> 42:42.928
I should go.

42:48.166 --> 42:49.601
