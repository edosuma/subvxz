00:59.493 --> 01:00.273
Who you are?

01:00.373 --> 01:01.922
[in American accent] Are you the captain?

01:01.932 --> 01:02.792
Yes…

01:02.892 --> 01:04.551
I'm here to take your big load.

Okay. Here. Here, please.
You no hurt me, please.

02:01.846 --> 02:04.126
-Bradly.
-Suzan.

02:05.126 --> 02:08.946
Your gift is still under the tree
out the front. Where have you been?

02:09.046 --> 02:11.545
I think you know where I've been, Suzan.

02:11.645 --> 02:14.105
Ah, yes. Italy. How was it?

02:14.205 --> 02:17.365
Well, let's just say
somebody spilled their coffee.

02:19.965 --> 02:21.964
Good.

02:22.924 --> 02:26.424
Looks like you've had a great time there,
consuming some spaghetti.

02:26.524 --> 02:29.064
I can eat whatever the hell I want
on assignments, Suzan.

02:29.164 --> 02:31.023
Besides, I intermittent fast, so…

02:31.123 --> 02:32.903
What's on your mind?

02:33.003 --> 02:35.583
I have given this a lot of thought.

02:35.683 --> 02:37.863
[Brad] And, well…

02:37.963 --> 02:39.963
-I want out.
-[Suzan coughing]

02:41.002 --> 02:43.262
I'm sorry, what was that?
[crunching on ice cubes]

02:43.362 --> 02:46.162
You know what I mean, Suzan. I just…

02:46.722 --> 02:48.222
I don't want to spy anymore.

02:48.322 --> 02:49.822
Okay? There, I said it.

02:49.922 --> 02:51.261
Not that I spy much.

02:51.361 --> 02:54.261
I mean, to be honest, it's an assassin job
at best when you think about it.

02:54.361 --> 02:55.981
You know what else, Suzan?

02:56.081 --> 02:59.900
I mean, just, I am sick and tired

03:00.000 --> 03:02.820
of all the running and the killing,
the killing and the running.

03:02.920 --> 03:05.220
And don't even get me started with
the henchmen. I mean, seriously.

03:05.320 --> 03:06.260
You know what, Suzan?

03:06.359 --> 03:08.780
I mean, I have to kill so many henchmen.

03:08.880 --> 03:11.779
I don't even know these guys.
They could be lovely people.

03:11.879 --> 03:13.298
You know what keeps me up at night, Suzan?

03:13.399 --> 03:17.119
I see a child without a father
playing catch by themselves.

03:17.959 --> 03:18.899
[in kiddie voice] "Daddy."

03:18.999 --> 03:21.338
What exactly do you mean by "out"?

03:21.438 --> 03:25.018
Don't shit with me, Suzan.
You know exactly what I mean.

03:25.118 --> 03:27.537
-Can you please sit down?
-Fine.

03:27.637 --> 03:30.416
These henchmen,
they're responsible for their own selves.

03:30.517 --> 03:31.617
Whatever!

03:31.716 --> 03:33.617
It's just-- just all that stuff.

03:33.716 --> 03:36.277
It's like, it's other… stuff.

03:40.117 --> 03:42.016
Okay.

03:42.115 --> 03:43.935
Tell me what happened.

03:44.036 --> 03:48.115
It all started when I got back from Italy.

03:48.875 --> 03:50.654
I'd just got the stolen plutonium back.

03:50.755 --> 03:51.654
Again.

03:51.755 --> 03:53.815
Everything felt different. Strange.

03:53.915 --> 03:57.015
Like I was slowly sinking deeper
and deeper in this pit.

03:57.114 --> 03:59.454
Pit of shit, or something similar.

03:59.554 --> 04:02.013
Like I was going in circles. Killing.

04:02.113 --> 04:04.113
Spying. Assassinating.

04:04.914 --> 04:06.013
And then I got the message.

04:06.113 --> 04:07.694
No, "Hi, how's life?"

04:07.793 --> 04:10.374
Or, "How'd the plutonium mission go?"

04:10.474 --> 04:11.333
Nope.

04:11.433 --> 04:13.132
Just another job.

all seven of them have been stolen
from a secret underwater submarine

04:23.551 --> 04:25.731
allegedly attempting to move the missiles

04:25.832 --> 04:29.852
to a supposed undisclosable location
somewhere in Russia.

04:29.952 --> 04:32.211
Something called Operation Gigolo.

04:32.311 --> 04:34.091
[female on TV] Sounds like
the Russians are at it again…

05:19.227 --> 05:20.527
You took the dog?

05:20.627 --> 05:22.366
Bradly, you know never to take the dog.

05:22.466 --> 05:24.885
[groans] I don't even know
why that's even a thing.

05:24.986 --> 05:26.646
You know what happened to John!

05:26.746 --> 05:30.885

Wickey just took that way too far.

-I know the story, Suzan.

05:40.065 --> 05:41.644
It's simple, no pets!

05:41.743 --> 05:44.123
Fine. I'm sorry, okay?

05:44.224 --> 05:46.224
I fucked up.

06:20.301 --> 06:22.920
Sorry, it's been a really crazy
few hours, you know?

06:23.020 --> 06:26.640
Half a dozen dogs were just released
in the park by some lunatic,

06:26.740 --> 06:28.960
who did actually die, apparently,
so fair enough.

06:29.060 --> 06:30.960
But also, like, you can imagine,

06:31.060 --> 06:33.878
little doggy limbs everywhere,
they all got hit by cars.

Oh.

Does look like it's broken.

06:51.377 --> 06:53.717
I'll need to keep her here for the night.
Get some X-rays done.

06:53.817 --> 06:55.597
Just, you know,
keep her under observation.

06:55.697 --> 06:57.597
-Is that going to be okay with you?
-Yeah, sure.

06:57.697 --> 06:59.236
Okay. Cool. What's her name?

06:59.337 --> 07:02.536
[distant clamor, dogs barking]

07:03.376 --> 07:08.135
-Pluto.
-Pluto. Aww. Hey, Pluto.

07:08.695 --> 07:12.755
So, um, we should have
her X-rays back by tomorrow.

07:12.854 --> 07:14.195
I can call you if you like.

07:14.295 --> 07:17.395
Or you can come in. Or I can call you.
Actually, I'll call you.

07:17.495 --> 07:20.655
You know, maybe it is best
that I just come in.

07:21.215 --> 07:23.194
-Let's do that.
-Okay.

07:23.294 --> 07:24.514
Yeah.

-All right.
-Okay.

07:25.734 --> 07:27.734
-Bye.
-Bye.

God, are you all right?

07:29.813 --> 07:31.234
Yeah, I'm fine.

07:31.334 --> 07:33.513
I just, um…

07:33.613 --> 07:35.673
-Are you okay?
-I am. I'm fine.

07:35.772 --> 07:37.113
Yeah, you seem fine.

07:37.212 --> 07:40.353
Thanks. I mean, apart from
all the dog shit, I'm great.

Yeah, I…

07:41.373 --> 07:43.712

Oh my God, I know.
I was just like, "Blah, blah, blah."

07:52.091 --> 07:54.091
No. Him!

07:54.651 --> 07:59.711
There was something special about her.
Her smile. Her eyes. Her lips.

07:59.811 --> 08:03.370
The crazy hair. It was all perfect.

08:04.409 --> 08:06.950
This phase that you're going through…

08:07.050 --> 08:08.190
It's not a phase, Suzan.

08:08.289 --> 08:11.229
Okay, fine. This meltdown
that you're having.

08:11.330 --> 08:13.069
It's completely normal.

08:13.169 --> 08:16.289
I'm serious, Suzan. I want out.

08:16.929 --> 08:18.989
I'll tell you what we're going to do.

08:19.089 --> 08:23.508
You are going to go on
a really good break.

08:23.608 --> 08:24.548
Seriously?

08:24.647 --> 08:26.707
I am serious, yes!

08:26.808 --> 08:31.546
Take all this positive energy of yours
and share it all over Veronica

08:31.647 --> 08:33.666
and get it out of your system
for a few days,

08:33.767 --> 08:35.787
and then come back here
and we can talk about it.

08:35.887 --> 08:38.827
Have you listened to anything
that I just said, Suzan?

08:38.926 --> 08:40.926
You're welcome.

08:42.685 --> 08:43.826
You know what? Fine.

08:43.925 --> 08:45.266
But no calls,

08:45.365 --> 08:47.425
and no messages to take anyone out.

08:47.526 --> 08:49.766
I'm serious, Suzan. If anyone does…

08:50.486 --> 08:53.744
Somebody is gonna get it.

08:53.845 --> 08:55.145
Approved.

08:55.244 --> 08:56.585
-Fine.
-Great.

08:56.685 --> 08:58.685
Fine.

08:59.285 --> 09:00.585
-Fine.
-Great.

09:00.685 --> 09:02.684
Great. Okay.

09:03.604 --> 09:05.604
Oh, and Bradley?

09:06.884 --> 09:08.884
Just remember, you are a spy.

09:09.364 --> 09:12.262
And you have a lot of enemies.

09:12.363 --> 09:14.883
More enemies than
all the other spies put together.

09:15.843 --> 09:18.022
Just… watch your back.

09:18.123 --> 09:22.722
Thanks for your hostility, Suzan.
Sorry, I meant hospitality.

09:25.442 --> 09:27.442

Psst!

[whispers] No.

10:44.273 --> 10:45.854
We have a mission, brother!

10:45.954 --> 10:47.374
Finally, a mission!

10:47.473 --> 10:48.493
Yes!

10:48.594 --> 10:50.413
Okay. Here is plan.

10:50.513 --> 10:52.134
Number one. We finish massage.

We finish massage.

10:53.393 --> 10:55.373
Number two. We celebrate.

10:55.473 --> 10:57.213
We celebrate? I like that.

10:57.313 --> 10:59.653
Number three. Then, we find fast bombs.

Fast bombs. Yeah.

-Fuck, Brad. Stop doing that shit.

11:31.030 --> 11:32.409
You know I hate it when you do that.

11:32.509 --> 11:34.888
I just, I sat down, like every other time.

11:34.989 --> 11:36.989
[dramatic ambient music playing]

11:39.628 --> 11:41.088
[James] Could you at least start with a,

11:41.189 --> 11:43.488
"Hello, how are you, do you
have a girlfriend yet?"

11:43.588 --> 11:45.647
Which, I mean, I don't,
but I probably would

11:45.748 --> 11:46.968
if it wasn't for this fucking job.

11:47.068 --> 11:50.167
Here. To show you
how much I appreciate you.

Sourdough!

12:06.465 --> 12:07.526
-No.
-What?

12:07.626 --> 12:10.526
No. See, this right here gets me worried.

12:10.626 --> 12:12.805
You giving before you get
reeks of off-the-book job, man.

12:12.905 --> 12:13.964
This is on my book, okay?

12:14.065 --> 12:15.925
And I always pay my debts, you know that.

12:16.025 --> 12:18.025
Wanna know what happened to me last time?

12:18.785 --> 12:21.125
I got violated. Literally, I got violated.

12:21.224 --> 12:23.963
They took away my satellite privileges
for, like, more than a week, man,

12:24.064 --> 12:25.564
I can't go through that shit again.

12:25.663 --> 12:29.023
James, you are the only one
that I can trust with this.

12:29.584 --> 12:32.304
-The only one.
-Really?

12:32.863 --> 12:34.863
Yes. Really.

12:35.782 --> 12:37.123
What do you need?

12:37.223 --> 12:39.583
Just do some background digging.

12:41.262 --> 12:43.162
Holy shit. You're taking out The Vet?

12:43.262 --> 12:47.122
Not The Vet. I mean, she is a vet, but…

12:47.222 --> 12:48.321
Not The Vet.

12:48.422 --> 12:50.561
Well, I mean, who is she then?
Is she, like, a normal?

12:50.662 --> 12:52.362
Like, a standard human
with problems and stuff?

12:52.462 --> 12:56.201
You know, find out what her hobbies are.
Favorite café, favorite restaurant.

12:56.300 --> 12:59.281
Family info. Does she, y'know, does she…

12:59.381 --> 13:01.241
She what?

13:01.340 --> 13:04.240
Have a boyfriend.
Does she have a boyfriend?

13:04.339 --> 13:07.000
No. No, I-- I can't. I can't do that.

13:07.099 --> 13:09.599
Brad, I really don't want to do this.
This makes me really…

13:09.700 --> 13:12.720
-I can't do it. No, I'm not doing it!
-Whoa, whoa, James, relax.

13:12.819 --> 13:15.559
Maybe you're right.
Maybe I should, you know,

13:15.658 --> 13:17.398
look around for some new IT support.

13:17.499 --> 13:20.319
I mean, I did hear that you're buying
drones that your skills can't cash.

13:20.419 --> 13:22.759
Wait, who said that?
Did you talk to the union, man?

13:22.858 --> 13:23.798
Fuck those guys.

13:23.897 --> 13:27.758
I may be emotionally scarred, have anxiety
and depressive issues. I know that.

13:27.858 --> 13:30.498
But can you please sit down? Please?

13:34.057 --> 13:36.676
I know that you are the best.
That's why I came to you.

13:36.777 --> 13:38.196
That's why I can trust you.

13:38.297 --> 13:39.517
I just… I just don't understand it.

13:39.617 --> 13:41.156
You've had thousands
and thousands of girls before.

13:41.257 --> 13:42.996
-I mean, you can get any girl you want.
-Yeah.

13:43.096 --> 13:44.996
But, y'know, they're
always assassin girls,

13:45.096 --> 13:46.876
spy girls, villain girls.

13:46.975 --> 13:48.975
I mean, this one, this one, she's…

13:49.656 --> 13:51.656
She's special.

13:52.776 --> 13:54.775
Give me a day.

13:55.254 --> 13:57.395
And no one can know about this.
Especially Suzan.

13:57.494 --> 13:59.954
-Yeah, sure. Fuck Suzan.
-Yeah. Fuck Suzan.

14:00.055 --> 14:03.314
Yeah. You know, I met this really cute
girl at the café a few days ago.

14:03.414 --> 14:05.874
Yeah, I really want to talk to her,
but I'm scared that…

14:05.973 --> 14:07.973
I dunno. I'm scared if I say anything,
she might…

14:08.854 --> 14:10.314
I dunno. She might slap me
across the face.

14:10.414 --> 14:11.513
Maybe I'm just overthinking it.

14:11.614 --> 14:13.233
What do you think I should…

14:13.333 --> 14:15.333
Brad?

[dramatic orchestral music playing]

14:26.652 --> 14:28.652

Oh, yes. Come to mama.

15:00.128 --> 15:02.309
Only six levels of encryption?

15:02.408 --> 15:04.407

15:20.567 --> 15:22.227
Oh, a bromance.

15:22.327 --> 15:24.326
So sweet.

15:31.646 --> 15:34.685
I'd like to speak to the Boss.

15:36.444 --> 15:38.685
I'm the one who took his big load.

15:39.444 --> 15:41.444
Calling to see if he'd like it back.

15:42.085 --> 15:42.944
[man groans]

15:43.045 --> 15:44.663
[The Vet] Please, stop moving.

15:44.763 --> 15:46.784
[fast orchestral music playing]

15:46.884 --> 15:48.884
This not make sense.

15:50.084 --> 15:52.084
[speaking German]

15:52.444 --> 15:54.443
[in English] Unbelievable.

15:55.443 --> 15:58.063
To find someone who has
so many bullets in head

15:58.163 --> 15:59.742
and still be alive.

15:59.843 --> 16:01.103
Mm? Yeah?

16:01.203 --> 16:04.402
We tried many times before,
experiments. Never work!

16:05.002 --> 16:07.002
Here.

16:07.642 --> 16:09.581
[music crescendos, stops abruptly]

16:09.682 --> 16:11.682
It's best I can do.

16:12.561 --> 16:14.860
-Fucking Brad!

[Russian folk metal music playing]

16:16.761 --> 16:18.761
[cellphone rings]

16:30.440 --> 16:31.940
Hello?

16:32.040 --> 16:33.939
[groans]

16:42.838 --> 16:43.938
[man speaks indistinctly]

17:04.076 --> 17:06.916
[dramatic orchestral music playing]

17:08.676 --> 17:10.676
Talk to me, Jennifer.

17:10.996 --> 17:14.975
A new weapon, well, seven of them,
developed by the Russians

17:15.075 --> 17:16.775
called hypersonic missiles

17:16.875 --> 17:19.775
have been stolen by a new player
known as Trident.

17:19.875 --> 17:22.575
These two are the Zarzoff brothers.

17:22.675 --> 17:24.094
Ernie and Bernie.

17:24.194 --> 17:27.114
They're the sons of the Russian oligarch
known as the Boss.

17:28.754 --> 17:31.134
Do we have any idea of their intentions?

17:31.234 --> 17:34.053
We have reason to believe that
the weapons will be used simultaneously

17:34.153 --> 17:36.153
at seven locations around the world

17:37.113 --> 17:38.373
by the Russians.

17:38.473 --> 17:41.473
But you just said that they were
stolen from the Russians.

17:42.153 --> 17:43.773
Yes, that is correct.

17:43.873 --> 17:45.872
Right.

17:46.232 --> 17:48.372
I'm really confused right now.

17:48.472 --> 17:52.972
Intelligence believes that
Trident may have stolen the missiles,

17:53.072 --> 17:56.611
and then "may or may not"
have given them back to the Russians

17:56.711 --> 17:59.931
under the strict agreement
that they must use their stolen missiles

18:00.031 --> 18:05.430
to attack seven locations around the world
that are currently "unknown" to us.

18:06.350 --> 18:09.550
For fuck's sake, that's hardly
what I'd call "intelligence."

18:11.110 --> 18:13.970
Find out whatever you can
about these hyperthingy thingies.

18:14.070 --> 18:16.049
And get Roger back on the thingy-thingy

18:16.149 --> 18:18.369
because I think it's about time
he find out how pathetic

18:18.469 --> 18:19.769
this agency really has gotten.

18:19.869 --> 18:21.869
Yes, ma'am.

18:23.149 --> 18:24.728
These fucking Russians!

[music stops abruptly]

19:11.424 --> 19:14.164
Excuse me.
This area is out of bounds, clearly.

19:14.264 --> 19:17.443
Yeah, I'm so sorry.
I was told to come back here.

19:17.543 --> 19:21.483
-I-- I was due to pick up my dog.
-Oh, right here?

19:21.583 --> 19:24.083
You were told to wait right here
in this exact spot

19:24.183 --> 19:25.282
in the out-of-bounds area?

19:25.382 --> 19:26.802
-Right here?
-No, not right here.

19:26.902 --> 19:30.162
Yeah, no, I imagine not, because
it'd be incredibly stupid to allow

19:30.262 --> 19:33.922
-a white Caucasian male, early forties…
-Mid-thirties.

19:34.022 --> 19:36.641
…back here in the restricted,
special-people-only area.

19:36.741 --> 19:40.721
The exact demographic of 95%
of serial killers in the entire world.

19:40.821 --> 19:42.821
Okay. Well, that's good to know.

19:43.741 --> 19:47.520
Aww. Aren't they just so fucking pathetic.

19:47.620 --> 19:49.600
Do you have any idea
how many good-looking males

19:49.700 --> 19:53.040
walk through that door every day
with their bunch of amazing flowers

19:53.140 --> 19:54.959
and sick-dog routine and try and hit on V?

19:55.059 --> 19:56.199
That happens a lot?

19:56.299 --> 19:59.439
Yeah, and it's happening
by a good-looking serial killer right now.

19:59.539 --> 20:02.319
She hates flowers, by the way.
Just saying, FYI.

20:02.419 --> 20:04.319
She doesn't even like guys much.

20:04.419 --> 20:05.518
Oh.

20:05.618 --> 20:09.718
Oh, she's gay. I mean, not that
there's anything wrong with that.

20:09.818 --> 20:11.758
-No, that's not what I'm saying.
-You kinda did.

20:11.858 --> 20:13.858
Oh. Did I, serial killer?

20:14.338 --> 20:16.337
Okay…

20:16.897 --> 20:18.437
-You're back!
-Oh, hey!

20:18.537 --> 20:20.637
Wow, flowers? They're amazing,
are they for me?

20:20.737 --> 20:22.917
I'm kidding, of course they're not.

20:23.017 --> 20:25.916
But you know, that'd be super-weird.
They're obviously for your dog.

20:26.016 --> 20:29.456
That is super-thoughtful. I mean,
you know, that's pretty cute, right?

20:29.556 --> 20:30.736
Well, Pluto…

20:30.836 --> 20:32.976
You know what, I've just been telling him
how busy you've been.

20:33.076 --> 20:37.095
Like, 24/7 busy, you don't really
have any time for serial killers.

20:37.195 --> 20:38.815
Can you get Pluto from the back for me?

20:38.915 --> 20:40.495
Don't want to go get Pluto from the back--

20:40.595 --> 20:42.595
For me. Thank you.

20:43.915 --> 20:46.414
So, Pluto's X-ray came back,

20:46.514 --> 20:48.494
and she did break her leg, unfortunately.

20:48.594 --> 20:51.374
-Oh, that's terrible.
-But it's so fine, I put a splint on it.

20:51.474 --> 20:53.254
-So you can take her home today.
-Today?

20:53.354 --> 20:56.413
You've just got to keep an eye on her
for a week, but she is all yours.

20:56.513 --> 20:58.252
-All mine?
-Yeah.

20:58.353 --> 21:00.213
-That's great. No problem.
-Yeah, great news, right?

21:00.313 --> 21:02.313
-I bet you've been missing her.
-Oh…

21:03.033 --> 21:05.033
I really love flowers.

21:05.392 --> 21:06.532
Oh! That's good.

It's just… ah, it doesn't matter.

-For you.

21:16.311 --> 21:18.131

Wow!

21:21.431 --> 21:22.651
Oh. Uh-oh.

21:22.751 --> 21:23.731
-What?
-It got me.

21:23.831 --> 21:26.330
What? You… oh!

21:26.430 --> 21:28.450
Oh, you're… oh.

21:28.550 --> 21:31.290
-Allergy.
-Okay. You gotta be kidding me.

21:31.390 --> 21:34.230
-Okay. Are you… uh-huh.
-I can't breathe!

21:34.790 --> 21:36.909
All right. I'm just gonna… okay.

21:38.349 --> 21:41.209
-Tess! Hurry.
-What? Oh my God. What happened? V?

21:41.309 --> 21:44.209
She's going into anaphylactic shock.
Do either of you have an EpiPen?

21:44.309 --> 21:46.728
-The Shih Tzus ate it last week.
-Okay!

21:46.828 --> 21:48.328
Uh, give me some water.

-Okay.
-Okay, water.

There you go.

And… hello?

22:02.707 --> 22:04.707
What's going on? And you're… gone.

22:05.427 --> 22:06.566
Uh…

22:06.666 --> 22:08.126
I got the water.

22:08.226 --> 22:10.526
Oh, my fucking God.
Is she gonna fucking die?

22:10.626 --> 22:11.526
Okay, that's not good.

22:11.626 --> 22:12.806
Oh my God, is she dead?

22:12.906 --> 22:15.805
Out of curiosity, she doesn't have
a heart condition, by any chance?

22:15.905 --> 22:17.725
Yeah, if her heart rate goes
too high, her heart can stop,

22:17.825 --> 22:19.825
which is why we use a special EpiPen.

22:20.385 --> 22:22.685
Okay. Uh… I…

22:22.785 --> 22:23.925
Do me a favor.

22:24.025 --> 22:26.644
Get me some blankets, some sugar,
some salt, ah, some water?

-Okay, sure.

Hey.

22:54.582 --> 22:55.961
There you go. You're okay.

22:56.061 --> 22:58.201
We're okay. It's okay.

22:58.301 --> 23:01.121
Okay. I've got everything,
but I couldn't find any sugar.

23:01.221 --> 23:04.081
-It's fine. Ambulance is on the way?
-Yeah. Ten minutes.

23:04.181 --> 23:05.001
Okay.

23:05.101 --> 23:07.100
-Hey, welcome back.
-Thank God, V.

23:09.420 --> 23:11.600
Who the fuck are you?

23:11.700 --> 23:14.180
Me? Oh, no one. I sell candles.

Candles?

23:34.818 --> 23:38.417
-Hi.
-Brad! You're still here.

23:39.057 --> 23:41.177
Yeah, you know, I…

23:44.417 --> 23:47.936
I figured it was the least I could do,
considering what happened.

23:48.496 --> 23:50.396
Oh, and…

23:50.496 --> 23:51.636
I got you these.

23:51.736 --> 23:53.516
Don't worry, they're fake.

23:53.616 --> 23:54.916
And I sprayed them as well.

23:55.016 --> 23:56.355
With all-natural ingredients.

23:56.455 --> 23:58.915
I figured that you probably
wouldn't want to kill anything,

23:59.015 --> 24:01.015
even if it was the thing
that tried to kill you.

24:01.695 --> 24:04.475
-I'll just put them…
-Yeah. Yeah, thank you.

24:04.575 --> 24:06.514
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

24:06.614 --> 24:08.394
Look, I was wondering…

24:08.494 --> 24:11.434
Well, not wondering,
I wanted to ask you something.

24:11.534 --> 24:13.594
And it's just…

24:13.694 --> 24:15.694
-I'm not very good at this.

24:20.013 --> 24:21.513
-[dramatic orchestral music playing]
-Okay.

24:21.613 --> 24:24.893
Just give us a sec.
I just, I'm just gonna…

24:27.212 --> 24:29.152
Oh, actually! Don't drink that.

24:29.252 --> 24:31.072
It's, you know, it's old.

24:31.172 --> 24:33.932
It's probably got dust in it, so…
I can get you another one.

[music resumes]

24:58.649 --> 25:01.069
Okay, okay, um. Tell you what?
I'm gonna close this

25:01.169 --> 25:03.309
just because, you know,
it's a little bit draughty in here.

25:03.409 --> 25:04.789
And I'm gonna get you another water!

25:04.889 --> 25:06.188
So, don't go anywhere.

25:06.288 --> 25:08.588
Stay there.
I'll get you a hot dog. A soda.

25:08.688 --> 25:10.188
I'm rambling. I'm just gonna go.

25:10.288 --> 25:11.908
Okay. I'll be right back.

26:08.482 --> 26:09.382
Tess?

26:09.482 --> 26:11.542
-So, you're okay?
-Yeah, I'm fine.

26:11.642 --> 26:13.902
I'm fine. Yeah, he's here.

26:25.641 --> 26:28.940
-[quiet orchestral music playing]
-Seriously, V, I've no idea how he did it.

26:29.040 --> 26:31.100
I feel like there can only
be one explanation.

26:31.200 --> 26:34.220
-And what's that?
-He's a superhero!

26:34.320 --> 26:37.779
They exist, V! You know,
you've seen all those Glass films,

26:37.879 --> 26:40.259
and the other films from the guy
who made those Glass films.

26:40.359 --> 26:41.299
They're out there, V!

26:41.399 --> 26:44.779
You're like this weak, innocent, fragile,
useless person who's, you know,

26:44.879 --> 26:45.819
completely normal.

26:45.919 --> 26:48.498
And he's just attracted
to his polar opposite, which is you!

26:48.598 --> 26:50.138
That's not very helpful.

26:50.238 --> 26:52.798
-[loud orchestral music playing]
-[grunting]

26:58.997 --> 27:00.997
Fucking Twins.

27:04.077 --> 27:06.237
I better go. Okay, bye.

27:09.676 --> 27:11.676
Who're you spying on?

27:14.116 --> 27:15.176
No one.

27:15.276 --> 27:19.335
There was just this little kid, and I got
the last soda, and he just went ballistic.

27:19.435 --> 27:20.735
Dangerous move.

27:20.835 --> 27:23.215
Yeah. So, how're you feeling?

27:23.315 --> 27:24.895
Doctor said I can go, so…

27:24.995 --> 27:27.014
Great timing.

27:27.114 --> 27:30.794
You were saying something, actually,
before you disappeared.

27:31.474 --> 27:34.994
Yeah. Uh… yeah. Look, I just…

27:36.074 --> 27:37.493
I just…

27:37.593 --> 27:39.573
I wanted to clear something up.

27:39.673 --> 27:42.552
And just be honest
and transparent with you.

27:44.833 --> 27:50.332
I know it seems as though I was the one
responsible for nearly killing you.

27:50.432 --> 27:52.372
Actually killing me.

27:52.472 --> 27:54.572
Okay. Fair enough.

27:54.672 --> 27:56.212
But really, I mean,

27:56.312 --> 27:58.051
it was the bee that did it.

27:58.151 --> 28:01.251
Un-bee-lievable.

28:01.351 --> 28:02.771
I know, right?

28:02.871 --> 28:05.591
And he should've been here
to explain this to you.

28:07.990 --> 28:09.570
But he's dead.

28:09.670 --> 28:13.410
It may have been the bee
who mis-bee-haved.

28:13.510 --> 28:15.810
But you're an accomplice, so…

28:15.910 --> 28:17.909
No, fair enough. Okay, yeah.

28:19.109 --> 28:23.089
I'll tell you what. Why don't we just
leave this bee stuff behind us,

28:23.189 --> 28:25.929
and just focus on new bee-ginnings?

28:26.029 --> 28:28.028
[phone vibrates, beeps]

28:28.788 --> 28:30.168
What do you think?

28:30.268 --> 28:31.728
-Whoa!
-What's wrong?

28:31.828 --> 28:34.568
-Gee, like, I guess it's just…
-What is?

28:34.668 --> 28:37.247
…really quite bee-wildering to me

28:37.347 --> 28:40.047
how long it's taking you
to ask me out on a date.

28:40.147 --> 28:41.607
So I'm gonna do it for you.

28:41.707 --> 28:44.967
I like pumpkin soup.
Do you like pumpkin soup?

28:45.067 --> 28:46.087
I do.

28:46.187 --> 28:48.206
Would you like to have
pumpkin soup with me?

28:48.306 --> 28:50.246
-[alarm goes off, commotion outside]
-Yes.

28:50.346 --> 28:51.526
Do you accept this mission?

28:51.626 --> 28:53.626
-I do.
-[commotion getting louder]

28:54.386 --> 28:56.046
What is going on out there?

28:56.146 --> 28:58.005
You know. It's a hospital.

28:58.105 --> 28:59.565
Sounds like someone's having twins.

-[softly] Fucking Russians.

29:14.864 --> 29:16.864
Hey, I can't get the focus working.
Can you help me?

29:17.543 --> 29:19.003
[Uri] Oh, very nice bike.

29:19.103 --> 29:21.203
[Orgi] Very slick, I like it.

29:21.303 --> 29:22.723
Gentlemen.

29:22.823 --> 29:24.683
We here to take missiles back.

29:24.783 --> 29:27.922
On the contrary. I'm here
to give you your missiles back.

29:28.022 --> 29:29.242
How much?

29:29.342 --> 29:30.642
How much for what?

29:30.742 --> 29:31.802
Missile.

29:31.902 --> 29:33.082
Nothing.

29:33.182 --> 29:35.442
Oh, I like it. You are hard negotiator.

29:35.542 --> 29:37.601
[Orgi] Very… very sexy.

29:37.701 --> 29:39.641
I like it. How much?

29:39.741 --> 29:42.401
As it seems you have not been informed:

29:42.501 --> 29:44.441
I'm giving you back your missiles,

29:44.541 --> 29:47.241
and you will use your fleet
of MiG fighter jets

29:47.341 --> 29:49.240
to take down some targets of my choosing.

29:49.340 --> 29:50.480
Interesting, interesting.

29:50.580 --> 29:52.240
So, like personal vendetta…

29:52.340 --> 29:55.160
Like a revenge motive?
You know, like a real spy film.

29:55.260 --> 29:57.319
[both continue discussing indistinctly]

29:57.419 --> 29:59.439
Can't we just give you money
and then take missiles?

29:59.539 --> 30:02.319
-It's much easier.
-No. You can't.

30:02.419 --> 30:03.599
Your boss agreed.

30:03.699 --> 30:07.099
Boss? Boss never said that.
Where are these missile thingies, hmm?

30:08.458 --> 30:10.458
-There.
-Where?

30:11.658 --> 30:12.638
In the water.

30:12.738 --> 30:13.918
[choral music playing]

30:14.018 --> 30:16.078
You sink it?

30:16.178 --> 30:17.278
It's not part of deal!

30:17.378 --> 30:18.797
-For fuck's…
-[Uri] The Boss is not happy.

30:18.897 --> 30:21.137
-[grunts angrily]
-[Uri] Super, duper unhappy!

30:22.177 --> 30:26.137
No! I didn't sink it. It's a submarine.

30:27.576 --> 30:29.396
-[Uri] Oh.
-It's your submarine.

30:29.496 --> 30:31.756
-Could be submarine.
-Could be submarine.

30:31.856 --> 30:33.856
Here.

30:34.496 --> 30:36.316
[talking indistinctly on phone]

30:36.416 --> 30:38.415
[scoffs] Again?

30:38.855 --> 30:40.435
Will you seriously sit down, please?

30:40.535 --> 30:41.795
…will make you more sensitive…

30:41.895 --> 30:45.315
I think it's the right size.

30:45.415 --> 30:47.754
-[both] Yeah!
-[laughter]

30:47.854 --> 30:49.114
Oh my God.

30:49.214 --> 30:50.234
How we get there?

30:50.334 --> 30:52.354
-You swim.
-Swim?

30:52.454 --> 30:54.454
-We could swim. Yeah.
-Could swim. Yeah.

30:55.254 --> 30:57.254
Who is this personal vendetta with?

30:58.373 --> 30:59.993
Fucking Brad.

31:00.093 --> 31:02.353
Brad? The Brad?

31:02.453 --> 31:03.393
Who's "Brad"?

31:03.493 --> 31:06.613
Like a spy legend.
Brad is like a spy legend.

31:08.812 --> 31:11.032
I'll send you the activation codes
when they're in the air.

31:11.132 --> 31:15.312
He never dies! He's like a hero
in this spy action film.

31:15.412 --> 31:17.791
-We're not in spy action film.
-All the bullets aimed at him…

31:17.891 --> 31:22.151
[Orgi imitates machine gun fire]
Nothing gets him! Nothing gets him!

31:22.251 --> 31:23.951
Who are you?

31:24.051 --> 31:25.351
[woman on phone] In the head.

31:25.451 --> 31:27.810
[camera shutters clicking]

31:32.570 --> 31:34.730
[orchestral music playing]

31:38.129 --> 31:41.469
[man] What is going on there, Suzan?
Don't sound fucking good to me.

31:41.569 --> 31:42.549
Tell him, Jennifer.

31:42.649 --> 31:44.749
These missiles are unstoppable, sir.

31:44.849 --> 31:47.788
The only thing unstoppable
is my wife's spending habits.

31:47.888 --> 31:50.068
These missiles are phenomenally accurate,

31:50.168 --> 31:54.108
and can yield an impact equal to ten tons
of high explosives without a warhead.

31:54.208 --> 31:58.347
They are also capable of reaching almost
any city on the planet within 30 minutes.

31:58.447 --> 31:59.667
Well, where's fuckin' Brad?

31:59.767 --> 32:00.867
Ain't he taking care of this shit?

32:00.967 --> 32:02.987
I can't be doing
every fucking thing around here.

32:03.087 --> 32:04.347
He'll be back online soon.

32:04.447 --> 32:06.067
As soon as he refocuses,

32:06.167 --> 32:07.747
and starts thinking
with that other head of his.

32:07.847 --> 32:10.266
You just listen to me, Suzan.
You fucking listen to me right now.

32:10.366 --> 32:14.206
You get those fucking bad balls back,
and you get Brad back. Goddammit!

32:17.766 --> 32:19.425
Well, go on, sort it out, Jennifer!

32:19.525 --> 32:21.785
I want Brad back in this room
within the hour.

32:21.885 --> 32:24.965
And take Paradise with you
in case this try-hard shows up.

32:27.805 --> 32:29.104
There is something else.

32:29.204 --> 32:31.024
Oh, God. Of course there is.
What is it? Spit it out.

32:31.124 --> 32:32.984
It's Walker. He's still alive.

32:33.084 --> 32:35.084
Oh, for…

32:36.124 --> 32:38.123
Well, take Natasha as well, then.

32:38.443 --> 32:41.623
Are you sure that's a good idea?
I mean, given their… you know.

32:41.723 --> 32:44.943
Well, clearly bullets
don't seem to be working, do they?

32:45.043 --> 32:47.863
Just don't tell her that he's around
unless it's absolutely necessary.

32:47.963 --> 32:50.222
It could very quickly lead
to a clusterfuck!

32:50.322 --> 32:52.322
Yes, Suzan.

32:56.042 --> 32:58.801
[lounge music playing]

33:01.121 --> 33:03.881
-[music continues]
-[tableware clinking]

33:09.360 --> 33:10.380
Thank you.

33:10.480 --> 33:12.580
This place is beautiful.

33:12.680 --> 33:14.680
Yeah, it's nice. It's relaxing.

33:15.560 --> 33:17.740
You know, I actually saved
the owner's life once,

33:17.840 --> 33:19.539
so he kind of owes me big-time.

33:19.639 --> 33:22.899
Really? You do that a lot, save lives?

33:22.999 --> 33:24.659
Well, only…

33:24.759 --> 33:26.539
only the people that matter.

33:26.639 --> 33:28.638
Well, and a few others.

33:30.438 --> 33:33.098
You know what, I'm just gonna
get this out in the open.

33:33.198 --> 33:35.578
You know, we don't have to talk about it.

33:35.677 --> 33:37.677
No, I want to.

33:39.797 --> 33:42.017
It's a really rare heart condition.

33:42.117 --> 33:47.377
It makes me highly susceptible
to ventricular fibrillation,

33:47.477 --> 33:49.476
or sudden cardiac arrest.

33:50.196 --> 33:53.216
If my heart rate rises quickly, then

33:53.316 --> 33:57.876
the electrical system in my heart
becomes irregular, and I pass out.

34:01.715 --> 34:04.275
If that happens, I have two minutes…

34:04.955 --> 34:07.135
and, well, you saw the rest.

34:07.235 --> 34:09.234
It's no blood going to the brain…

34:14.114 --> 34:16.573
You know, the worst thing is,
I can't drink coffee.

34:16.674 --> 34:18.772
Well, you know what they say about coffee.

34:18.872 --> 34:21.933
Just makes people do stupid things faster.

34:22.033 --> 34:25.533
You're really not worried
that I could die at any moment?

34:25.633 --> 34:27.212
No.

34:27.312 --> 34:30.172
I mean, it's just a part of life.

34:30.272 --> 34:32.412
Gotta live.

34:32.511 --> 34:36.652
Besides, I'm actually more worried
about the calamari they serve here.

34:36.752 --> 34:38.750
[phone vibrates]

34:39.151 --> 34:42.151
-I'm so sorry.
-Candle business is booming, huh?

34:44.191 --> 34:46.310
Yeah, yeah, vanilla spice, it's a hit.

34:46.951 --> 34:48.290
You can take that if you want.

34:48.390 --> 34:49.490
[phone keeps vibrating]

34:49.589 --> 34:51.589
[slow guitar overture]

34:54.710 --> 34:57.029
[orchestra comes in]

35:05.388 --> 35:07.888
No. No, I'd rather pull my teeth out

35:07.989 --> 35:10.008
or jump out a plane without a parachute

35:10.107 --> 35:12.107
than take that call.

35:12.627 --> 35:13.647
Okay.

35:13.747 --> 35:17.968
So I would have thought that
being a vet would be stressful.

35:18.067 --> 35:22.607
Weirdly enough, it's like,
around animals, I'm really calm.

35:22.707 --> 35:25.667
Even in extreme circumstances,
there's just

35:26.267 --> 35:28.426
something about them that makes me feel…

35:30.586 --> 35:32.006
settled.

35:32.105 --> 35:35.145
Anyway, that is enough about me.
I wanna know about you.

35:35.665 --> 35:37.526
Me? Oh, uh…

35:37.625 --> 35:40.365
How's life as a candle… guy?

35:40.464 --> 35:41.645
Uh…

35:41.745 --> 35:44.404
You know, I'm just going to go
to the restroom real quick.

35:44.504 --> 35:45.484
What, again?

35:45.585 --> 35:47.924
You know, I have some medication
for bladder control

35:48.024 --> 35:49.364
I can give you for that.

35:49.464 --> 35:51.044
It's for dogs.

35:51.144 --> 35:53.243
-So same thing really.
-That's very funny.

35:53.343 --> 35:56.283
You know, I will try it.
I'll try anything once.

35:56.384 --> 35:57.843
I'll be right back.

35:57.944 --> 35:59.942
Okay.

36:04.423 --> 36:06.542
[orchestral music playing]

36:30.339 --> 36:32.359
You know, I would really appreciate it

36:32.460 --> 36:34.560
if we could just
pick this up another time.

36:34.660 --> 36:36.600
You know, it's just I'm just right
in the middle of something

36:36.700 --> 36:38.700
that's a very special moment.

36:39.379 --> 36:42.019
-Trident says hello.
-Trident.

36:42.578 --> 36:44.979
Where do they come up with these names?
I mean, honestly.

36:45.819 --> 36:52.317
They still calling you "the Apprentice"?
As in, learning to assassinate?

36:52.417 --> 36:55.997
Okay, well, yeah.
But it's a whole system, okay?

36:56.098 --> 37:01.596
You know, it's a pyramid of apprentice,
apprenti, apprentees.

37:01.696 --> 37:05.156
And like, it's better to be
the apprentice just under Trident,

37:05.256 --> 37:08.116
than to be the boss
at the bottom of the pyramid.

37:08.216 --> 37:09.995
She's there, and I'm just below her…

37:10.096 --> 37:11.716
So Trident is a she.

37:11.816 --> 37:13.915
-I didn't say that.
-Yeah, you kinda did.

37:14.015 --> 37:16.756
-I didn't…
-I know that Trident's a woman.

37:16.855 --> 37:22.115
You don't know anything, okay. It's like,
he, she, she's he, her's him, you know?

37:22.214 --> 37:23.875
You heard what I wanted you to hear.

37:23.975 --> 37:27.355
-Fine. He, she, they, whatever, okay?
-Let's go with they.

37:27.455 --> 37:29.035
-Okay, they.
-Okay.

37:29.134 --> 37:34.254
Is this Trident…
is she really worth dying for?

37:37.254 --> 37:39.254
For you, maybe.

37:39.812 --> 37:41.553
No, you mean for you.

37:41.653 --> 37:44.673
No, I mean for you, she is-- he is. They.

37:44.772 --> 37:48.993
Okay, she. But if I die,
it wouldn't be for that reason.

37:49.093 --> 37:50.591
But you would die, though.

37:50.692 --> 37:54.152
No, I get that. But what I'm saying is,
that wouldn't be the same thing

37:54.252 --> 37:56.752
because I'm asking you,
are you willing to die for her?

37:56.852 --> 37:59.471
Which implies I would be asking myself.

37:59.571 --> 38:03.111
But I, clearly… [whispers] I wouldn't.

38:03.211 --> 38:05.310
No.

38:05.410 --> 38:07.111
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

38:07.211 --> 38:10.290
Okay, I'm… I'm super-confused.

38:10.850 --> 38:12.850
Take a minute, and think about it.

38:13.410 --> 38:15.410
Okay?

38:19.410 --> 38:21.408
[orchestral music playing]

38:23.408 --> 38:26.169
-Really?
-Yeah. You know who I am, right?

38:28.529 --> 38:30.528
[grunting]

38:36.528 --> 38:38.528
[groans]

38:39.247 --> 38:40.346
Impressive.

38:40.446 --> 38:42.647
[grunting, groaning]

38:53.046 --> 38:54.705
[choking, wheezing]

38:54.806 --> 38:56.506
Shh, it's okay.

38:56.605 --> 39:01.285
It's okay, it's okay. Now just…
sleep, now. Okay.

39:02.484 --> 39:04.305
Okay. Sleep, now.

39:04.404 --> 39:06.404
Good, Apprentice. Good work.

39:13.404 --> 39:16.124
I am terribly sorry that took so long.

39:17.203 --> 39:19.203
Phew.

39:19.683 --> 39:21.683
So. What did I miss?

39:22.243 --> 39:24.383
You wanna get out of here?

39:24.482 --> 39:26.183
Sure.

39:26.283 --> 39:28.283
Let's.

39:28.962 --> 39:31.682
[slow sentimental music playing]

39:37.801 --> 39:43.461
Whoa. Okay. You need to be careful.
You literally just got out of hospital.

39:43.560 --> 39:45.681
I don't wanna be careful anymore.

39:48.520 --> 39:51.279
Besides. You saved my life once.

39:52.160 --> 39:53.980
Do you think you can do it again?

39:54.080 --> 39:58.439
Oh yeah, I'm highly skilled
in the area of saving lives, so I feel--

39:59.000 --> 40:02.499
Oh my God, I'm so sorry.
I don't know what came over me.

40:02.598 --> 40:03.538
Are you okay? You look…

40:03.638 --> 40:06.259
-Whoa, hey. Hey, hey.
-Seriously, Brad, that was so aggressive.

40:06.359 --> 40:09.538
-No. No, it's fine. It's fine. I mean…
-Is it?

40:09.638 --> 40:12.178
Yeah, if that's something inside of you,

40:12.278 --> 40:15.538
then it's probably best that,
you know, you get it out.

40:15.638 --> 40:19.578
Otherwise, you're not being honest
with yourself. Or me.

40:19.678 --> 40:21.676
Okay.

40:23.236 --> 40:25.497
I feel so fucking great right now.

40:25.596 --> 40:28.756
You are so great right now.

40:32.915 --> 40:34.296
Stay right there.

40:34.395 --> 40:36.395
I'm not going anywhere.

40:41.314 --> 40:43.314
Oh, boy.

40:44.355 --> 40:46.355
Oh my God.

40:49.194 --> 40:51.573
Be cool. You got this, just…

40:51.674 --> 40:53.374
Okay.

40:53.473 --> 40:54.573
Let me see.

40:54.674 --> 40:57.573
No snipers. No bad guys.

40:57.674 --> 40:59.674
No villains, please.

41:01.913 --> 41:03.913
[phone vibrates]

41:05.792 --> 41:06.812
Tess!

41:06.913 --> 41:08.133
V, what the hell are you doing?

41:08.232 --> 41:10.252
I swear to God, you better be
feeding ducks right now,

41:10.352 --> 41:12.971
or at least something very similar
but as equally boring.

41:13.071 --> 41:14.531
I am going for it.

41:14.631 --> 41:17.212
I mean, really going for it.

41:17.312 --> 41:19.652
V, you literally just got out
of the hospital.

41:19.752 --> 41:22.410
Actually, no, you just freaking died!

41:22.511 --> 41:25.651
Remember that skimpy outfit
you bought me like six years ago,

41:25.750 --> 41:27.750
and I've never had the guts to wear?

41:29.671 --> 41:31.669
Putting it on.

41:32.390 --> 41:34.990
Iris? Activate agency app.

41:35.910 --> 41:38.810
-Uh-huh, and…
-Open mouth, please.

41:38.910 --> 41:40.908
Now spraying.

41:45.029 --> 41:47.468
Banana? Ugh, I hate banana.

41:54.107 --> 41:55.448
Ejecting now.

41:55.548 --> 41:57.548
Ooh, banana!

41:58.147 --> 41:59.567
Okay.

41:59.667 --> 42:01.667
[phone vibrates]

42:03.227 --> 42:04.926
This better be important, James.

42:05.027 --> 42:07.287
I'm in the middle
of the best night of my life.

42:07.386 --> 42:09.966
What are you talking about?
Everything I tell you is important.

42:10.067 --> 42:12.486
Usually, it saves your life,
it's that friggin' important. Also…

42:12.586 --> 42:15.165
I'm really busy right now. I can't talk.

42:15.265 --> 42:17.046
Thank you, Tess, I love you.

42:17.145 --> 42:19.426
[panting]

42:22.825 --> 42:23.924
-Someone named Trident.
-What else?

42:24.024 --> 42:26.285
It's a girl. I think she's linked
to the agencies.

42:26.384 --> 42:28.365
She stole a hypersonic missile
and sold it to the Russians.

42:28.464 --> 42:30.044
What, wait a minute. Only one?

42:30.145 --> 42:32.144
Well, seven actually.

42:34.024 --> 42:34.884
Brad?

42:34.984 --> 42:36.984
-Wait, you need to know this--
-I gotta go.

42:40.183 --> 42:42.263
Do you like it? It's a lot, isn't it?

42:42.903 --> 42:45.962
I don't know what I was thinking.
I'm gonna go and take it off, it's so…

42:46.062 --> 42:48.723
No. No, no, no, no. No.

42:48.823 --> 42:50.821
It's perfect. Okay?

42:52.062 --> 42:54.942
You're perfect. All right?

[peaceful music playing]

44:24.692 --> 44:26.692
[in Russian accent] Does it hurt?

44:27.413 --> 44:29.413
[in Russian accent] A little.

44:31.051 --> 44:33.051
Actually, a lot.

44:34.011 --> 44:35.912
What did the doctor say?

44:36.011 --> 44:38.011
"No more bullet in head."

44:40.892 --> 44:42.890
Missed you at the Christmas party.

44:44.931 --> 44:47.071
I miss you so much.

44:47.171 --> 44:49.651
I really wanted to come. But…

44:52.609 --> 44:53.549
[grunts]

44:53.649 --> 44:55.149
Why didn't you call me, huh?

44:55.250 --> 44:57.569
I had to hear about it from Paradise.

44:58.169 --> 45:00.189
I really wanted to.

45:00.290 --> 45:03.189
Just, one bullet was pushing on another.

45:03.288 --> 45:05.448
My mouth wouldn't work properly.

45:06.769 --> 45:08.769
[tearfully] You poor thing.

45:09.249 --> 45:11.388
I even tried to call you.

45:11.488 --> 45:15.388
But the words were
all over the place, and not make sense.

45:15.488 --> 45:18.528
My God. That's terrible.

45:19.808 --> 45:21.986
[groans, sobs]

45:22.087 --> 45:23.627
Oh, sorry!

45:23.727 --> 45:25.807
It's okay. It's fine.

45:26.966 --> 45:27.826
I'm sorry as well.

45:27.926 --> 45:31.067
Honestly, this, it's never happened
to me so quickly before.

45:31.167 --> 45:33.225
Never. Never, ever. Ever.

45:33.326 --> 45:35.386
-Me neither.
-Really? Never?

45:35.486 --> 45:37.586
-No.
-I'm sorry. I feel so ashamed.

45:37.685 --> 45:39.506
-No, I mean me.
-You?

45:39.605 --> 45:41.384
-Me.
-You've never had it happen to you before?

45:41.484 --> 45:44.185
-I've never. No, I have never.
-Oh, you've never…

45:44.285 --> 45:46.064
I've never come so quickly before.

45:46.165 --> 45:48.205
Oh. Okay, okay.

45:48.765 --> 45:50.865
-That's good. That's really good.
-Yeah.

45:50.964 --> 45:52.964
It is.

This is a big one for me. Have you ever…

hit anyone in anger?

46:59.638 --> 47:00.778
Uh…

47:00.877 --> 47:02.377
Have I ever hit anyone in anger?

47:02.477 --> 47:05.397
Let me think about that one. Uh…

47:13.196 --> 47:15.176
No.

Nope. Never.

Your turn.

47:20.676 --> 47:22.674
Okay.

What's something you've
always wanted to do,

47:27.115 --> 47:29.615
except you've been too afraid to do it?

47:29.714 --> 47:33.754
Oh. There's lots of things.
Given my… condition.

-You mean anything?
-Anything.

I've always wanted to…

-No!

Actually, we need your help.

I don't wanna help you,
and I don't need your help.

48:30.669 --> 48:31.569
This is serious!

48:31.669 --> 48:34.127
Yeah, when is it not serious?
Come on, we're spies.

-There's someone new--
-I know, okay!

It's Trident, she's working
with the Russians.

48:37.508 --> 48:38.567
They've got new missiles, okay?

48:38.667 --> 48:40.127
Does this sound familiar too? It should.

48:40.227 --> 48:43.946
You want to know why? Because this
happens, like, every single year.

-[Veronica] Who is it?
-No one.

with me right now,

-But I will. I will.
-Okay, no. No.

-Have you heard of that Lucy, though?
-Yeah.

49:06.064 --> 49:08.984
Yeah! You know what, I'll call you back.

49:13.104 --> 49:14.044

Don't! Come on, Jennifer.

-Yeah, okay, go check it out.

You called for me, and I'm coming for you.

Did you do this for me?

Okay… yeah…

49:44.781 --> 49:46.781
[forced laugh] Oh God.

49:58.540 --> 50:00.660
[drum and bass music playing loudly]

50:05.459 --> 50:07.459
[Paradise groans]

50:13.377 --> 50:15.377
[Paradise in French] Here, bitch!

50:16.618 --> 50:18.618
[grunting]

50:22.337 --> 50:24.337
[Veronica] Whoo! Whoo!

50:25.656 --> 50:27.357
-Where are you going?
-I just, you know…

50:27.457 --> 50:29.997
-C'mon, we're having this party!
-Yeah, I gotta get some ice.

50:30.096 --> 50:32.096
Well, hurry!

50:33.495 --> 50:34.915
[funk music playing]

50:35.015 --> 50:36.756
[exhales] Okay.

50:36.855 --> 50:38.855
[groans]

50:41.576 --> 50:43.575
Okay.

50:44.214 --> 50:47.055
-[grunting]
-[drum and bass music playing loudly]

51:03.893 --> 51:06.292
Nobody likes a gossip, Paradise.

51:13.692 --> 51:15.692
-[Natasha] Fuck! I hate you!
-[Walker] Get up!

51:17.212 --> 51:18.272
Fuck you.

51:18.372 --> 51:20.511
You love her so much, go live with her.

51:20.611 --> 51:23.770
Fuck you too!
I never wanna see your bitch face again.

51:24.491 --> 51:26.491
Well, you never will!

51:31.410 --> 51:33.410
Walker?

51:38.730 --> 51:40.950
Fucking Brad!

51:41.049 --> 51:42.509
[dramatic choral music playing]

51:42.609 --> 51:44.229
Shit.

51:44.328 --> 51:46.388
Always small.

51:46.489 --> 51:48.269
Everything small.

51:48.368 --> 51:51.269
Well, it's just 'cause you're so… big, so

51:51.368 --> 51:55.408
things probably look small,
but I'd say I'm in proportion, so…

51:56.087 --> 51:57.627
No hard feelings, what do you say?

51:57.727 --> 51:59.028
None.

51:59.127 --> 52:01.868
Okay, c'mon. Given the circumstances,

52:01.968 --> 52:04.866
don't you think it's best we just, y'know,
pick this up maybe another time?

52:04.966 --> 52:06.966
I dunno. Can we?

52:07.406 --> 52:10.027
Okay, look. It was very
unprofessional of me.

52:10.127 --> 52:13.145
And, y'know, I should've finished
the job when I had the chance.

52:13.245 --> 52:14.745
You should have.

52:14.846 --> 52:16.066
But you didn't.

52:16.165 --> 52:18.225
-You're so lucky.
-Think about it. I mean,

52:18.326 --> 52:20.506
you're still alive, you've got
a beautiful woman,

52:20.605 --> 52:22.026
and you're alive.

52:22.125 --> 52:23.785
So maybe you're lucky.

52:23.884 --> 52:25.884
No. You lucky one!

52:26.205 --> 52:29.464
Could we just maybe agree to disagree?

52:29.564 --> 52:31.564
-[in Russian] No!
-Okay.

52:32.845 --> 52:34.964
What're you doing? Really?

52:35.843 --> 52:37.843
You really are doing this. Oh my God.

52:38.604 --> 52:40.604
Okay.

52:41.323 --> 52:42.424
Let's go.

52:42.524 --> 52:44.522
Let's go, c'mon!

52:44.843 --> 52:46.843
D?

52:50.403 --> 52:51.663
Sweet-pea?

52:51.763 --> 52:52.982
I'm sorry.

52:53.082 --> 52:54.902
I didn't mean what I said.

52:55.002 --> 52:56.341
Me either.

52:56.442 --> 52:58.022
Please forgive me.

52:58.122 --> 53:01.821
I just get super emotion
when you bring up my mother like that.

53:01.922 --> 53:03.461
And I love your mother!

53:03.560 --> 53:07.461
I just need to learn
how to handle the situation better.

53:07.560 --> 53:09.421
I know she can be hard.

53:09.520 --> 53:11.540
But she's my mamochka, you know?

53:11.640 --> 53:14.259
And I respect how much you love her.

53:14.359 --> 53:17.640
And I respect how much you respect that.

53:19.960 --> 53:21.960
Come here.

53:32.399 --> 53:34.397
[slow jazz music playing]

53:34.718 --> 53:36.718
[relieved sigh]

53:39.038 --> 53:41.038
Okay.

53:41.917 --> 53:43.917
[bones clicking]

53:44.236 --> 53:46.236

-[groans]

[jaw clicking]

53:53.076 --> 53:55.076
[loud click]

54:10.395 --> 54:11.375
Hey.

54:11.475 --> 54:13.473
Hi.

54:13.834 --> 54:14.854
Nice hotel.

54:14.953 --> 54:19.073
Oh, yeah. Lovely hotel. I love the décor.

54:19.593 --> 54:22.334
Yeah. Great beds as well.

54:22.433 --> 54:24.573
-Oh, very comfortable, yeah.
-Yeah.

54:24.673 --> 54:26.852
-Like a cloud.
-Yes, just like that.

54:26.953 --> 54:28.933
[Jennifer clears throat]

54:29.033 --> 54:31.033
S…

54:34.832 --> 54:41.551
-I get it. I really get it.
-Yeah, I know. She's great, huh?

54:42.872 --> 54:46.531
But do you really think putting her in
all this danger is something you should do

54:46.631 --> 54:48.571
to someone you care about?

54:48.671 --> 54:53.071
You're a spy, Brad.
Falling in love just isn't what we do.

54:54.830 --> 54:56.930
So I've been told.

54:57.029 --> 55:00.210
Head Office for a briefing
in one hour. Be there.

55:00.310 --> 55:05.888
Okay, fine. Hey, maybe we don't,
you know, mention this to Suzan?

55:05.989 --> 55:10.408
Oh, yes, thank God!
I was thinking the exact same thing.

55:10.509 --> 55:12.569
-For the best, yeah.
-Gosh, yes.

55:12.669 --> 55:15.448
One team, one dream. I'm so glad
we are on the same page with that.

55:15.548 --> 55:17.548
-That's perfect.
-No Suzan. Okay.

55:18.868 --> 55:21.028
Oh, one more thing.

55:22.268 --> 55:24.207
The little… you know.

55:24.307 --> 55:27.767
Just rest, and no running for 24 hours

55:27.866 --> 55:29.866
because things might fall out of you. So…

55:30.707 --> 55:34.105
-Okay. Yeah.
-But you'll be fine. Okay. Good.

55:34.705 --> 55:36.705
Thank you. Thank you for sharing.

55:44.904 --> 55:46.904
Oh, man.

55:49.625 --> 55:51.625
Dammit!

55:55.624 --> 55:57.624
[glass smashing]

55:58.024 --> 56:00.024
[helicopter noise]

56:06.263 --> 56:08.263
Veronica?

56:08.663 --> 56:09.723
V?

56:09.823 --> 56:11.863
[helicopter getting louder]

56:12.703 --> 56:14.701
V?

56:26.901 --> 56:28.901
[Veronica screams]

56:32.421 --> 56:34.419
[Veronica still screaming]

56:38.939 --> 56:40.919
Every time!

56:41.020 --> 56:42.040
Dammit!

56:42.140 --> 56:44.259
[dramatic choral music playing]

56:50.098 --> 56:52.979
-[dramatic orchestral music playing]
-Iris? Iris, call James for me.

56:53.658 --> 56:56.337
-James, where the hell are you?!
-[voicemail] Hi, you've reached James.

56:56.897 --> 56:58.877
If you urgently need me, again,

56:58.977 --> 57:00.957
then try me again when I'm clearly
not busy with something else

57:01.058 --> 57:03.078
that is equally if not more important.

57:03.178 --> 57:04.716
If you would like to just talk,

57:04.817 --> 57:06.477
then I'll call you back
when I'm in the right place.

57:06.576 --> 57:08.576
Okay, bye.

57:09.297 --> 57:11.297
[music continues]

58:06.651 --> 58:08.651
[both grunting]

58:12.131 --> 58:15.810
[both speaking Russian]

58:18.410 --> 58:20.410
[grunting]

58:27.408 --> 58:30.549
[both speaking Russian]

58:30.649 --> 58:32.649
To our success.

58:36.607 --> 58:38.607
[phone ringing]

58:39.288 --> 58:41.288
Jet men!

58:42.048 --> 58:42.948
Hello?

58:53.287 --> 58:55.466
Dongle. Give me dongle.

58:55.566 --> 58:59.406
-Show you my dongle? [muttering]
-Oh, I see. Authenticator.

59:00.205 --> 59:02.205
[indistinct muttering]

59:03.125 --> 59:05.125
Second.

59:06.205 --> 59:08.105
Uh… one,

59:08.205 --> 59:11.544
eight, nine, five, four, six.

59:19.283 --> 59:22.584
The jet men. They want to
break up and fly alone, I think.

59:22.683 --> 59:24.743
Typical jet men.

59:30.522 --> 59:33.363
-Split yourselves up.

59:37.241 --> 59:38.902
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Ten minutes?

59:39.002 --> 59:41.622
That's too soon. Can we do thirty?

59:41.721 --> 59:44.221
Still haven't told Boss yet.
Don't anybody--

59:52.040 --> 59:54.040
-He called me "sir."
-Nice.

59:54.441 --> 59:56.620
They want to launch in ten minutes.

59:56.720 --> 59:57.859
But we not tell Boss yet.

59:57.960 --> 59:59.960
He want to watch from satellite.

1:00:00.359 --> 1:00:02.379
Satellite too slow.

1:00:02.480 --> 1:00:04.480
They'll never make it.

1:00:05.279 --> 1:00:08.138
Fuck it. Let's do it.
Let's blow these loads.

1:00:08.239 --> 1:00:10.459
-Let's blow this shit.
-Let's do it, let's blow it!

1:00:10.558 --> 1:00:11.618
Let's blow it.

1:00:11.718 --> 1:00:13.538
Yeah, launch missiles in ten.

1:00:17.877 --> 1:00:20.298
-Fuck the Boss.
-Fuck the Boss.

1:00:20.397 --> 1:00:22.477
[at once] Fuck the Boss!

1:00:40.316 --> 1:00:42.475
[orchestral music playing]

1:00:49.075 --> 1:00:50.254
[static buzzing]

1:00:50.355 --> 1:00:53.355
-Please identify yourself.
-It's Brad, James. C'mon.

1:00:53.875 --> 1:00:55.013
James, open the door. C'mon.

1:00:55.114 --> 1:00:57.334
Brad who? I know like seven Brads, okay?

1:00:57.433 --> 1:00:59.053
Open the fucking door, c'mon!

1:00:59.154 --> 1:01:00.854
Please state last name, age,

1:01:00.953 --> 1:01:03.013
social security number,
and last seven kills.

1:01:03.114 --> 1:01:05.252
If you don't let me in right now,
I'm gonna tell Suzan

1:01:05.352 --> 1:01:07.513
to take away your satellite
privileges. Again.

1:01:15.951 --> 1:01:19.011
Seriously, James.
I don't have time for games.

1:01:19.111 --> 1:01:21.732
I told you, I friggin' told you, Brad,
it's always the fucking Russians.

1:01:21.832 --> 1:01:23.611
Even when it's not the Russians,
it's still the Russians.

1:01:23.712 --> 1:01:26.290
-We need to find her, James.
-Did you say "we"?

1:01:26.390 --> 1:01:29.531
Because "we" implies that you'd actually
be doing something, but from memory,

1:01:29.631 --> 1:01:31.290
you don't even have
a computer, Brad, okay?

1:01:31.390 --> 1:01:33.410
And I'm always the one
stuck in this shithole of a room

1:01:33.511 --> 1:01:34.611
doing everything myself!

1:01:34.711 --> 1:01:40.189
Okay! Fine, James.
You, can you please find her! Please?

1:01:42.390 --> 1:01:46.529
Fine! Already have. She's in an abandoned
steelworks building outside of town. Here.

1:01:46.629 --> 1:01:49.269
That's impossible.
How'd you find her so quickly?

1:01:50.269 --> 1:01:52.529
Okay, so it's the nanobot dust particles
that I've been working on.

1:01:52.629 --> 1:01:53.808
Like, billions of them, actually.

1:01:53.908 --> 1:01:56.368
They attach themselves to anyone
you come into contact with.

1:01:56.468 --> 1:01:59.247
Nano what? What're you talking about?

1:01:59.348 --> 1:02:00.328
Y'know, the smart dust?

1:02:00.428 --> 1:02:04.607
I put some in your aftershave, toothpaste,
deodorant, anti-ageing moisture cream…

1:02:04.707 --> 1:02:08.047
Okay. And who gave you the authority
to do that, James?

1:02:08.147 --> 1:02:10.406
I was just thinking that…

1:02:10.506 --> 1:02:12.767
Suzan said that I could…
Well, I just thought that…

1:02:12.866 --> 1:02:13.966
Well, actually…

1:02:14.067 --> 1:02:16.006
You just "thought that…" is it?

1:02:16.105 --> 1:02:17.886
Look, we're getting off-topic over here,
so maybe we should

1:02:17.986 --> 1:02:19.086
just focus on the mission at hand?

1:02:19.185 --> 1:02:20.846
And so, Veronica's right here, see?

1:02:20.946 --> 1:02:23.086
Complete invasion of privacy.

1:02:23.185 --> 1:02:24.926
-Okay, so that's her there?
-Yes.

1:02:25.026 --> 1:02:26.044
-You're sure?
-Yep.

1:02:26.145 --> 1:02:28.785
Okay. All right. So, next thing. Well…

1:02:29.424 --> 1:02:34.524
I need a gun that's, y'know,
it's kinda, like, nonlethal.

1:02:34.625 --> 1:02:38.163
What?! I mean, Paradise said you were
losing your shit, but this, really?

1:02:38.263 --> 1:02:40.323
"Nonlethal"? This is some
really weird behavior, Brad.

1:02:40.424 --> 1:02:43.084
-I'm kinda worried about you, actually.
-Come on, James. Whaddya got?

1:02:43.183 --> 1:02:45.923
Fine! Okay, yeah, sure, I'll give you
some "useless nonlethal bullets"

1:02:46.022 --> 1:02:47.323
that, of course, don't even exist

1:02:47.423 --> 1:02:48.723
because everyone knows that a projectile

1:02:48.823 --> 1:02:51.323
traveling at that velocity or speed
will, of course, kill anyone.

1:02:51.423 --> 1:02:55.022
But if you really want something, there's
a nonlethal gun in that box over there.

1:02:57.462 --> 1:02:59.462
Unbelievable.

1:03:00.261 --> 1:03:02.261
"Non-death gun. Only use if soft."

1:03:02.982 --> 1:03:03.801
Really?

1:03:03.902 --> 1:03:05.681
Hey, wha…? What?

1:03:05.781 --> 1:03:08.480
What, what, that's…

1:03:08.580 --> 1:03:10.241
That's it? That's all you got?

1:03:10.341 --> 1:03:13.000
-What about this one? This one looks cool.
-What do you mean, is that all I got?

1:03:13.100 --> 1:03:15.361
That's my genius. Know how long
that thing took me to make?!

1:03:15.461 --> 1:03:17.460
Okay! Fine, how does it work?

1:03:17.939 --> 1:03:19.939
Fuck's sake, Brad!

1:03:20.460 --> 1:03:22.460
Just press this button over here… [sniffs]

1:03:22.939 --> 1:03:27.038
What have I told you about that? Don't
do that, I told you that's weird. Okay.

1:03:27.138 --> 1:03:28.479
Just press this button over here, okay?

1:03:28.578 --> 1:03:31.038
So the gun will discharge
a small wave of targeted energy

1:03:31.138 --> 1:03:32.959
that'll act like a taser,
knocking them out.

1:03:33.058 --> 1:03:36.497
What, so this is exactly
what I just asked you for?

1:03:37.618 --> 1:03:39.618
-James?
-Whatever.

1:03:40.018 --> 1:03:41.837
-Okay, fine!
-Remember one thing, okay?

1:03:41.937 --> 1:03:43.598
Do not turn the gun on full.

1:03:43.698 --> 1:03:47.037
Okay, fine. What happens
if I do turn it on full?

1:03:47.136 --> 1:03:48.557
I don't actually know.

1:03:48.656 --> 1:03:51.156
Possibly some long-term,
probably permanent damage

1:03:51.256 --> 1:03:54.716
to the body, eyes, ears, heart, anus.

1:03:54.817 --> 1:03:56.556
Anus? What do you mean, anus?

1:03:56.656 --> 1:03:58.556
I dunno, Brad, just trying
to cover my bases, okay?

1:03:58.656 --> 1:04:00.875
Just listen to what I say.
Don't turn it on full.

1:04:00.975 --> 1:04:06.555
Just to confirm: nonlethal gun, unlimited
bullets, just don't use it on full.

1:04:06.654 --> 1:04:08.674
Once again, I showed it to Head Office,

1:04:08.774 --> 1:04:11.395
and they just think it's a toy.
I mean, seriously, c'mon!

1:04:11.495 --> 1:04:14.194
Look at me. Do I look like someone
who plays with toys to you?

1:04:14.294 --> 1:04:15.794
-Well, I…
-I think not!

1:04:15.894 --> 1:04:17.993
Whatever. Okay, tell me.

1:04:18.093 --> 1:04:19.593
What am I walking into here?

1:04:19.694 --> 1:04:22.073
You had one job, Jennifer, one job!

1:04:22.174 --> 1:04:23.953
How could you fuck this up?

1:04:24.053 --> 1:04:26.493
-[Natasha crying]
-Call yourself a trainee spy.

1:04:27.212 --> 1:04:28.433
You're pathetic.

1:04:28.533 --> 1:04:30.153
[chuckles]

1:04:30.252 --> 1:04:32.033
How much do you bench-press?

1:04:32.133 --> 1:04:34.133
-[phone vibrates]
-Shh.

1:04:34.573 --> 1:04:39.412
-Jennifer.
-Suzan. I have a small update for you.

1:04:40.571 --> 1:04:41.991
Trident took Brad's girl.

1:04:42.091 --> 1:04:44.091
-[Natasha sobbing over phone]
-Paradise is missing.

1:04:44.812 --> 1:04:49.191
The missiles are in the air,
and the Dog Walker is gone.

1:04:49.290 --> 1:04:50.511
-Again.
-I'll fucking kill him!

1:04:50.611 --> 1:04:52.071
Don't touch him, he's mine.

1:04:52.171 --> 1:04:53.551
What happened with Brad?

1:04:53.651 --> 1:04:55.191
He's gone after his girl.

1:04:55.290 --> 1:04:59.149
Oh for God's sakes!
What about these hypersonic thingies?

1:04:59.250 --> 1:05:02.509
What's he doing about those?
I can't be doing everything around here!

1:05:02.609 --> 1:05:05.470
Find these Russian idiots,
and get that code!

1:05:05.569 --> 1:05:06.388
I'm on it.

1:05:06.489 --> 1:05:08.388
You know what?
I'm just gonna call Brad right now.

1:05:08.489 --> 1:05:10.489
Shut the fuck up, Natasha!

1:05:11.129 --> 1:05:13.308
You're not the only one
with problems, you know!

1:05:13.408 --> 1:05:16.247
I'm sorry. That was harsh. Love is hard.

1:05:17.127 --> 1:05:19.308
[Natasha keeps sobbing]

1:05:19.408 --> 1:05:22.508
-[funk music playing]
-[police sirens wailing]

1:05:22.607 --> 1:05:25.908
[man] Squad, move out.
No sudden movements. Keep quiet.

1:05:26.008 --> 1:05:27.466
Davis, is that a knife?

1:05:27.567 --> 1:05:30.027
-Where's your gun?!
-I don't need it.

1:05:30.127 --> 1:05:33.667
Shit. Shut the fuck up.
Right, move, move, move!

1:05:33.767 --> 1:05:35.767
Everybody, stay in formation.

1:05:38.846 --> 1:05:40.846
[henchman] Here he is! Over here!

1:05:41.966 --> 1:05:43.866
James, I'm walking into the compound.

1:05:43.966 --> 1:05:46.064
You got eyes on me? I need to know
what I'm walking into here.

1:05:46.165 --> 1:05:47.865
Copy. I've deployed the triplets.

1:05:47.964 --> 1:05:49.424
Approaching location.

1:05:49.524 --> 1:05:51.705
[drones whirring]

1:05:51.805 --> 1:05:53.904
[man 1] This place is filthy!

1:05:54.004 --> 1:05:56.004
-[man 2] Have you had your tetanus shot?
-[man 3] I haven't.

1:05:58.524 --> 1:06:00.464
Hey, guys, wait up!

1:06:00.564 --> 1:06:03.203
-Brad, Suzan wants to talk to you.
-Well, I really don't wanna talk to her.

1:06:04.604 --> 1:06:05.544
Patching you through now.

1:06:05.644 --> 1:06:07.643
Bradly, where are you?

1:06:09.482 --> 1:06:11.542
Lots of windy noise.

1:06:11.643 --> 1:06:14.763
Just wondering what your plan is
about these hypersonic missiles.

1:06:17.122 --> 1:06:20.102
C'mon, everybody knows how much
I make this shit up as I go!

1:06:20.201 --> 1:06:23.341
You know what, I'm pretty pissed
that nobody's asking me

1:06:23.442 --> 1:06:25.462
about how my girlfriend's doing right now.

1:06:25.562 --> 1:06:26.500
I mean, seriously.

1:06:26.600 --> 1:06:30.781
It's just these missiles are in
the sky right now, Bradley.

1:06:30.881 --> 1:06:32.881
So things are a little tight.

1:06:40.439 --> 1:06:42.460
Any idea who's behind this?

1:06:42.560 --> 1:06:45.020
Well, Suzan, my guess-- whoa!

1:06:45.120 --> 1:06:46.979
Jesus!

1:06:47.078 --> 1:06:48.138
[grunts]

1:06:48.239 --> 1:06:50.859
…from the intel which I gathered myself

1:06:50.959 --> 1:06:52.698
is that there are
seven hypersonic missiles

1:06:52.799 --> 1:06:54.939
heading for agency locations
around the world.

1:06:55.038 --> 1:06:58.417
So, Trident is an ex-spy
who's seeking revenge

1:06:58.518 --> 1:07:00.538
for some past wrongdoing by me.

1:07:00.638 --> 1:07:02.258
Which, of course,
I have no recollection of,

1:07:02.357 --> 1:07:04.178
and can't recall such an event.

1:07:04.278 --> 1:07:08.417
But really, this is just
some elaborate plan of hers to distract me

1:07:08.517 --> 1:07:10.057
so I don't foil the Russian plot

1:07:10.156 --> 1:07:12.017
to take down the agency

1:07:12.116 --> 1:07:14.817
with seven hypersonic missiles.

1:07:14.917 --> 1:07:17.935
Now if you don't mind, Suzan,
I've really gotta go, okay?

1:07:18.035 --> 1:07:20.035
I'm right in the middle of something here.

1:07:22.196 --> 1:07:24.196
Here we go.

1:07:26.035 --> 1:07:28.555
[hard rock music playing]

1:08:05.551 --> 1:08:07.410
[James] So, I'm picking up
a lot of heat signatures.

1:08:07.511 --> 1:08:09.330
I suggest using super caution.

1:08:09.431 --> 1:08:11.431
Yeah, let's do that, shall we?

1:08:13.790 --> 1:08:15.410
[dramatic choral music playing]

1:08:15.511 --> 1:08:18.030
James. Naughty boy.

1:08:23.990 --> 1:08:26.349
-What the hell?!
-[computer] Candy offline.

1:08:28.068 --> 1:08:30.509
-Cherry offline.
-What the hell?!

1:08:37.108 --> 1:08:38.808
Crystal offline.

1:08:38.907 --> 1:08:39.968
[Brad] What happened?

1:08:40.068 --> 1:08:44.128
They shot my babies. They shot my babies!
Oh my God, Oh my God!

1:08:44.228 --> 1:08:45.808
I can't believe they just did that!

1:08:45.907 --> 1:08:48.067
[overlapping shouting, grunting]

1:08:48.787 --> 1:08:51.947
Just… I need a minute. I need…

1:08:52.947 --> 1:08:56.047
[Brad] James! I'm gonna buy you
some new ones.

1:08:56.147 --> 1:08:58.686
No! See that's what it is
with all you spies!

1:08:58.786 --> 1:09:00.526
We're all replaceable.
Well, I'm not, okay?

1:09:00.626 --> 1:09:02.626
And neither are my drones!

1:09:04.786 --> 1:09:07.285
Well, I mean, technically
my drones are, but I'm not!

1:09:07.385 --> 1:09:10.825
Seriously, these drones
are becoming a real issue. Just relax!

1:09:19.384 --> 1:09:21.483
James? It would really help
to know what room she's in!

1:09:21.584 --> 1:09:24.044
-I'm working on it, Brad!
-[man shouts indistinctly]

1:09:24.144 --> 1:09:26.544
[James speaking indistinctly
under gunfire and grunting]

1:09:38.501 --> 1:09:40.501
[man speaking inaudibly]

1:10:11.299 --> 1:10:13.438
Okay, I'm scanning the perimeter now.
Got the missiles too.

1:10:13.539 --> 1:10:16.159
The hypersonics are aiming at the
seven agency buildings around the world.

1:10:16.259 --> 1:10:17.638
See? I mean, I called that.

1:10:17.737 --> 1:10:19.918
-I so fucking called that!
-Whatever, Brad.

1:10:20.018 --> 1:10:23.117
-Well, which one is it, James?! Seriously.
-[James speaks indistinctly]

1:10:23.218 --> 1:10:25.218
[Walker grunts]

1:10:30.177 --> 1:10:31.876
Walker?

1:10:31.977 --> 1:10:33.197
Now is good time.

1:10:33.297 --> 1:10:37.157
No, now is a really terrible time.
How the hell did you find me?

1:10:37.257 --> 1:10:40.356
I hack into nanobot from your hair,
and trace signal.

1:10:40.456 --> 1:10:43.116
You hacked through six layers
of encryption that James…

1:10:43.215 --> 1:10:44.635
You know what? It doesn't matter.

1:10:44.736 --> 1:10:46.736
I don't have time for this.

1:10:47.415 --> 1:10:49.415
[grunting]

1:10:57.255 --> 1:10:59.254
Are you trying to hurt me?

1:10:59.733 --> 1:11:01.674
I'm confused!

1:11:01.773 --> 1:11:03.914
[groans]

1:11:04.014 --> 1:11:05.954
That really fucking hurt, Walker!

1:11:06.054 --> 1:11:08.053
[groans] Fuck.

1:11:08.813 --> 1:11:10.313
Now is time to die.

1:11:10.413 --> 1:11:13.072
I crush your penis with my bare hand!

1:11:13.173 --> 1:11:16.112
Okay, that is a super weird
thing to say, but--

1:11:16.213 --> 1:11:19.032
Oh, c'mon, c'mon, okay, I'm pretty sure

1:11:19.132 --> 1:11:23.052
that Natasha would want us
to talk about this.

1:11:25.852 --> 1:11:27.352
Stop touching tip!

1:11:27.452 --> 1:11:29.451
Okay, fine. Before you kill me,

1:11:30.531 --> 1:11:32.991
Natasha really wanted me
to give you something.

1:11:33.090 --> 1:11:34.351
Just getting it out of my pocket.

1:11:34.451 --> 1:11:38.370
She really wanted you to have this, okay?

1:11:43.730 --> 1:11:45.809
What the…? Walker?

1:11:49.528 --> 1:11:50.789
Walker?

1:11:50.889 --> 1:11:51.709
Walker?

1:11:51.809 --> 1:11:53.809
[laughs loudly]

1:11:57.808 --> 1:11:59.388
You so funny!

1:11:59.487 --> 1:12:04.848
Ah, this is super-weird, so I'm just gonna
knock you out, if that's okay.

1:12:06.768 --> 1:12:09.246
[tragic music playing]

1:12:10.447 --> 1:12:12.427
I just love her so much.

1:12:12.527 --> 1:12:14.387
Love is tough.

1:12:14.487 --> 1:12:16.487
She too good for--

1:12:17.327 --> 1:12:19.925
I'm going to fucking kill you!

1:12:21.646 --> 1:12:25.226
Pop! Pop, it's… hi!

1:12:25.326 --> 1:12:27.705
Please, don't let them see me.

1:12:27.804 --> 1:12:28.985
Please, Pop!

1:12:29.085 --> 1:12:31.085
I'm gonna do this for both of us, okay?

1:12:34.005 --> 1:12:36.184
[thuds]

1:12:36.285 --> 1:12:39.504
What the fuck?! James, where are you?!

1:12:39.604 --> 1:12:41.664
Did you see that, that was super-crazy!

1:12:41.764 --> 1:12:42.824
I was in the toilet, Brad, okay?

1:12:42.924 --> 1:12:46.364
James? Where the hell are you, seriously?

1:12:54.083 --> 1:12:55.423
[man 1] What does this guy
actually look like?

1:12:55.523 --> 1:12:57.862
-[man 2] Never seen him before.
-[man 3] I heard he's got a nice ass.

1:12:57.961 --> 1:13:00.222
-[men chatting indistinctly]
-[goon yelps]

1:13:00.322 --> 1:13:02.862
Brad? Oh my God, please don't hurt me!

1:13:02.961 --> 1:13:05.862
You're… you're the one
pointing the rifle at me, so…

1:13:05.961 --> 1:13:09.181
Oh, of course, man, sorry.
It's my first day, man.

1:13:09.281 --> 1:13:11.141
I get to meet you, I'm such a huge fan.

1:13:11.241 --> 1:13:12.380
I was just calling my wife.

1:13:12.481 --> 1:13:14.741
I can't believe I get to catch Brad
my first night.

1:13:14.840 --> 1:13:16.221
Better put my mask on, excuse me.

1:13:16.321 --> 1:13:18.980
Oh God, so much dust around here.
You have dust in your eyes?

1:13:19.080 --> 1:13:21.460
I don't understand…

1:13:21.559 --> 1:13:23.500
Hold that thought, Brad.

1:13:23.599 --> 1:13:24.500
Ah-- ah--!

1:13:24.599 --> 1:13:26.599
-You okay?
-[sneezes loudly]

1:13:29.719 --> 1:13:32.059
I didn't get you, did I?
I'm so sorry, man.

1:13:32.159 --> 1:13:34.019
-I almost killed you.
-That was close, huh?

1:13:34.119 --> 1:13:35.979
Lovely to meet you.
Say hello to your wife for me.

1:13:36.079 --> 1:13:38.077
What?

1:13:41.718 --> 1:13:44.838
Brad, there is definitely
someone in the room right now.

1:13:46.278 --> 1:13:49.916
The presence. I can feel it.

1:13:53.916 --> 1:13:55.916
Oh my God, Lollipop?! Is that you?

1:13:56.517 --> 1:13:59.436
I've wanted to meet you
for such a long time. Oh my God.

1:14:00.956 --> 1:14:02.536
It's so great!

1:14:02.635 --> 1:14:06.316
Hi, James. Trident says hello.

1:14:07.556 --> 1:14:10.615
I like your drones.

1:14:10.715 --> 1:14:12.715
Oh my God, really? You like my drones?

1:14:13.195 --> 1:14:15.535
Oh, this is so exciting,
I can't believe it.

1:14:15.635 --> 1:14:17.135
Oh, it's the best day ever!

1:14:17.235 --> 1:14:19.233
-[hisses]
-Sort of.

1:14:22.114 --> 1:14:23.813
-[female voice] Bomb will explode…
-Veronica!

1:14:23.914 --> 1:14:26.374
-…in 20 seconds.
-Timers.

1:14:26.474 --> 1:14:28.473
Veronica! Hey, Veronica!

1:14:29.233 --> 1:14:31.373
Come on, this is completely overkill.

1:14:31.473 --> 1:14:32.532
[female voice] Fifteen…

1:14:32.633 --> 1:14:34.773
Veronica, you need to wake up. Please.

1:14:34.873 --> 1:14:37.233
Twelve, eleven, ten…

1:14:38.032 --> 1:14:41.352
-Shit, shit, shit! Veronica.
-Nine, eight, seven, six…

1:14:42.272 --> 1:14:46.692
Five, four, three, two, one.

1:14:46.791 --> 1:14:48.771
Villain chair activated.

1:14:48.871 --> 1:14:51.010
New timer activated. Good luck!

1:14:51.111 --> 1:14:52.771
Goddammit!

1:14:52.871 --> 1:14:54.090
Damn villain chairs.

1:14:54.191 --> 1:14:56.130
Seriously.

1:14:56.231 --> 1:14:58.250
James, where the hell are you?

1:14:58.349 --> 1:15:00.349
Dammit!

1:15:02.190 --> 1:15:03.610
Hey!

1:15:03.710 --> 1:15:05.970
Look, I know this is super random,
but if you're about to kill me,

1:15:06.070 --> 1:15:07.410
can I please just get a selfie with you?

1:15:07.510 --> 1:15:09.729
Oh, don't hurt me! Please, don't hurt me.

1:15:09.829 --> 1:15:10.929
[whimpering]

1:15:11.028 --> 1:15:14.289
-You know I can't do that.
-I'm just such a big fan.

1:15:14.389 --> 1:15:18.169
What you did in Bosnia and Korea
was just, Oh my God, so incredible!

1:15:18.269 --> 1:15:19.688
Oh my God! [moans]

1:15:19.788 --> 1:15:21.808
I just have… I have
a pretty big crush on you.

1:15:21.907 --> 1:15:23.968
So it'd be really, really great
if I could get that selfie!

1:15:24.068 --> 1:15:26.388
[both moaning]

1:15:27.308 --> 1:15:29.927
If I could just get that selfie with you
it'd be really great--

1:15:30.027 --> 1:15:32.327
[Lollipop moaning]

1:15:32.427 --> 1:15:34.427
[hard rock music playing]

1:15:38.427 --> 1:15:41.066
-[music continues]
-[men shouting encouragingly]

1:15:45.465 --> 1:15:47.246
[speaking indistinctly]

1:15:47.346 --> 1:15:49.345
[Uri] You want to check my… [inaudible]

1:15:50.465 --> 1:15:52.525
[Jennifer] Yeah, you like that?

1:15:52.625 --> 1:15:54.625
[both women making sexy noises]

1:16:02.903 --> 1:16:05.804
Veronica, I really need you to wake up!

1:16:05.903 --> 1:16:07.903
Please? Veronica?

1:16:09.503 --> 1:16:11.123
Hello, Bradly.

1:16:11.223 --> 1:16:13.043
[voice modulated, deeper] How are you?

1:16:13.143 --> 1:16:15.443
I'm… okay, I guess?

1:16:15.543 --> 1:16:18.123
As you're aware, seven missiles are now

1:16:18.223 --> 1:16:20.442
[voice modulated, deeper] targeting
the agency buildings around the world.

1:16:20.541 --> 1:16:22.602
What is it that you want?

1:16:22.702 --> 1:16:24.702
Just having a little fun.

1:16:25.461 --> 1:16:27.822
The bomb vest on the girl
is connected to her heart.

1:16:29.101 --> 1:16:30.961
If she dies, the vest will deactivate.

1:16:31.061 --> 1:16:34.601
If you move your arms
or get up from the chair,

1:16:34.701 --> 1:16:36.701
kaboom.

1:16:37.101 --> 1:16:39.740
James, where the hell are you?!
C'mon, we're running outta time here.

1:16:42.179 --> 1:16:44.260
[moaning]

1:16:46.700 --> 1:16:48.000
[whimpers]

1:16:48.099 --> 1:16:49.199
Time to die.

1:16:49.299 --> 1:16:51.299
Can we talk?
Can we please just talk? Please?

1:16:51.979 --> 1:16:52.999
[gun clicks]

1:16:53.099 --> 1:16:54.519
Can we talk? Please, can we just talk?

1:16:54.619 --> 1:16:56.079
Can we just talk? Please?

1:16:56.179 --> 1:16:57.839
No, I don't wanna die, please!

1:16:57.938 --> 1:16:59.938
Wait. One last request?

1:17:00.418 --> 1:17:02.918
The headphones.
Can you please just put them on?

1:17:03.018 --> 1:17:05.018
I don't wanna hear the sound of
the bullet before it kills me.

1:17:07.058 --> 1:17:08.518
No, that's wrong.

1:17:08.617 --> 1:17:11.817
The saying goes that you don't hear
the sound of the bullet that kills you.

1:17:12.376 --> 1:17:14.517
Ah, no, I don't think that's right.

1:17:14.617 --> 1:17:16.637
-It's right.
-Ah, no, it's not.

1:17:16.737 --> 1:17:17.916
Well, I think it's right.

1:17:18.017 --> 1:17:19.236
No, it's definitely not right.

1:17:19.336 --> 1:17:21.336
It is, most definitely, right.

1:17:21.816 --> 1:17:24.456
James, where the hell are you?!
C'mon, we're running outta time here.

1:17:25.016 --> 1:17:27.016
Veronica, wake up, please!

1:17:28.736 --> 1:17:30.715
Veronica, I've got this, okay?

1:17:30.815 --> 1:17:33.075
-Brad?
-Hey, it's me. It's Brad.

1:17:33.175 --> 1:17:37.995
Need you to look at me, stay calm, and pay
no attention to what's strapped to you.

1:17:38.095 --> 1:17:39.874
-Brad, what is it?
-It's nothing.

1:17:39.974 --> 1:17:42.193
-Well, I think it's a bomb.
-Yeah, okay, it is a bomb.

1:17:42.294 --> 1:17:44.994
Veronica, I need you to stay calm!
Just breathe.

1:17:45.094 --> 1:17:46.313
-Stay calm, okay?
-Get it off.

1:17:46.414 --> 1:17:48.273
-Get it off.
-Nothing is gonna happen to you.

1:17:48.374 --> 1:17:51.153
I promise, okay? I'm gonna get us
outta this, all right?

1:17:51.253 --> 1:17:53.253
What is that clock counting down to?

1:17:54.013 --> 1:17:55.233
That one?

1:17:55.333 --> 1:17:57.593
It's best not to pay attention
to clocks in these situations.

1:17:57.693 --> 1:17:58.673
These situations?

1:17:58.773 --> 1:18:00.772
Brutal truth?

1:18:01.132 --> 1:18:04.312
I don't sell candles, and, in fact,
I don't even like candles much.

1:18:04.412 --> 1:18:05.952
They just start too many
house fires, y'know?

1:18:06.052 --> 1:18:07.512
-Brad.
-Yeah, I'm sorry. Okay.

1:18:07.612 --> 1:18:10.611
Brutal truth, there's some things
I need to tell you.

1:18:11.211 --> 1:18:12.311
I'm a spy.

1:18:12.411 --> 1:18:14.191
And this here is just a, you know,

1:18:14.291 --> 1:18:17.031
stock-standard spy puzzle
that I need to solve.

1:18:17.130 --> 1:18:19.031
-What?
-A spy puzzle.

1:18:19.130 --> 1:18:22.429
Y'know? Like right now it's a lose-lose,
I need to turn it into a win-lose.

1:18:22.530 --> 1:18:23.630
The hard part's getting to a win-win.

1:18:23.730 --> 1:18:25.309
But I'm actually pretty good
at this stuff.

1:18:25.410 --> 1:18:28.110
-[hyperventilating] I can't breathe!
-No, just breathe!

1:18:28.210 --> 1:18:29.829
James!

1:18:29.929 --> 1:18:31.749
I have the gun.
I say it's right, so it's right.

1:18:31.849 --> 1:18:32.669
No, it's not,

1:18:32.769 --> 1:18:34.709
because even with a headshot, you can
still hear the sound of the--

1:18:34.809 --> 1:18:38.028
-It's not important, doesn't matter.
-Fine. I'll use my sword, then.

1:18:38.129 --> 1:18:39.428
No, no, no, no, no!

1:18:39.528 --> 1:18:41.188
The gun's good. Gun's good.
Just, headphones, please?

1:18:41.288 --> 1:18:43.288
Please? Headphones.

1:18:45.008 --> 1:18:47.008
All right. Be gentle.

1:18:48.968 --> 1:18:51.407
You can just see the bullet.

1:18:52.687 --> 1:18:54.687
No, no. What does that mean?

1:18:57.567 --> 1:18:59.566
Here comes the boom.

1:19:03.246 --> 1:19:06.366
My God, it's working.
Oh my God, it's working!

1:19:06.965 --> 1:19:08.385
It's working, everybody!

1:19:08.486 --> 1:19:11.465
Oh my God, did you see that?
Oh, wait, there's nobody here.

1:19:11.565 --> 1:19:13.184
Dammit, why is there nobody here?!

1:19:13.285 --> 1:19:15.825
This is so great.
I can't believe it's working!

1:19:15.925 --> 1:19:16.985
[wet pop]

1:19:17.085 --> 1:19:20.443
Wait, man, whoa! Oh man! What's happening?

1:19:21.604 --> 1:19:22.704
So sensitive!

1:19:22.804 --> 1:19:24.804
Best day ever! Best day ever!

1:19:25.483 --> 1:19:28.324

[indistinct, overlapping chatter]

1:19:48.842 --> 1:19:50.840
[both talking, slurred]

1:19:55.241 --> 1:19:57.021
All right. Find it, some kind of dongle.

1:19:57.121 --> 1:19:58.461
I not touch his dongle.

1:19:58.561 --> 1:20:00.580
No, like one of those
bank thingies, you know?

1:20:00.679 --> 1:20:02.660
Check the pockets, quick!

1:20:02.760 --> 1:20:04.760
-I think I found something.
-James!

1:20:05.960 --> 1:20:07.740
Brad… [panting]

1:20:07.840 --> 1:20:10.019
What the…?!

1:20:10.119 --> 1:20:11.259
Iris, call James.

1:20:11.358 --> 1:20:12.339
I'm scared.

1:20:12.438 --> 1:20:13.979
Please, look at me. Stay calm, Veronica.

1:20:14.079 --> 1:20:15.938
You're not gonna die. Nobody's gonna die.

1:20:16.039 --> 1:20:22.318
Well, somebody's definitely gonna get it,
but… Veronica? Veronica!

1:20:23.918 --> 1:20:26.577
Iris, I need you to start a timer.
One minute and thirty seconds from now.

1:20:26.678 --> 1:20:27.657
I'm back, baby.

1:20:27.758 --> 1:20:30.897
James, get me out of these
villain chairs now.

1:20:30.996 --> 1:20:32.737
Hey, you have no idea
what just happened to me, okay?

1:20:32.836 --> 1:20:35.217
And once again, you're not even asking
because it's always about you!

1:20:35.317 --> 1:20:37.557
James, please, can you just help me?

1:20:39.077 --> 1:20:41.255
Iris, I need you to get us out
of these damn villain chairs.

1:20:41.356 --> 1:20:43.016
She can't, Brad.
She's not powerful enough.

1:20:43.116 --> 1:20:45.056
Okay, well, do something then!

1:20:45.156 --> 1:20:46.616
Satellite's too slow, we'll never make it.

1:20:46.715 --> 1:20:48.776
Unless I build a new hacking app.

1:20:48.876 --> 1:20:51.455
Which I have, by the way,
because I actually look ahead…

1:20:51.554 --> 1:20:54.915
James, get me out of these
villain chairs now!

1:20:57.955 --> 1:20:59.495
-Open his eyes.
-Okay.

1:20:59.595 --> 1:21:01.214
Yes, it worked! I have to call Brad.

1:21:01.313 --> 1:21:03.313
Do it, just do it!

1:21:04.193 --> 1:21:07.554
-Done.
-Villain chair deactivated.

1:21:08.954 --> 1:21:10.952
Okay.

1:21:12.952 --> 1:21:13.853
Veronica.

1:21:13.952 --> 1:21:15.293
Hey.

1:21:15.393 --> 1:21:17.393
Okay. Dammit.

1:21:18.353 --> 1:21:20.012
I need an activation code now!

1:21:20.112 --> 1:21:22.331
[James] Jennifer's on the line
with some missile deactivation codes.

1:21:22.432 --> 1:21:24.092
In fact, she's got incredible timing.
Seriously, incredible.

1:21:24.192 --> 1:21:26.132
[Jennifer] God damn it, James!
Put me through!

1:21:26.232 --> 1:21:29.211
Brad! You need to enter in
the following numbers.

1:21:29.312 --> 1:21:30.291
Give me the damn number.

1:21:30.391 --> 1:21:31.411
Seven, one, eight…

1:21:31.510 --> 1:21:33.331
-What is the number?

1:21:33.431 --> 1:21:35.431
Seven, one, eight…

1:21:36.670 --> 1:21:38.331
Stop that, what're you doing?

1:21:38.431 --> 1:21:39.731
Eight, I said eight!

1:21:39.831 --> 1:21:41.450
Just tell me the damn code.

1:21:41.550 --> 1:21:43.809
-I am telling you the code.
-I can't hear you.

1:21:43.910 --> 1:21:46.010
Two, one, six, nine, six, nine.

1:21:46.110 --> 1:21:47.090
It didn't work!

1:21:47.190 --> 1:21:48.410
Hang on, just wait!

1:21:48.510 --> 1:21:49.490
Oh, God, it's changing!

1:21:49.590 --> 1:21:51.608
Just tell me the damn number, Jennifer!

1:21:51.709 --> 1:21:55.129
-Two, one, four, seven, five, nine.
-[computer] Nine, eight, seven.

1:21:55.229 --> 1:21:57.608
-Did it work? Brad?
-Six., five, four.

1:21:57.709 --> 1:21:58.769
-Three.
-Brad?

1:21:58.869 --> 1:22:00.867
Two. One.

1:22:09.148 --> 1:22:10.487
Okay, yes!

1:22:10.586 --> 1:22:12.327
Oh, thank God, it worked!

1:22:12.427 --> 1:22:16.887
Okay. Iris. James?
James, why is Iris dead?

1:22:16.987 --> 1:22:18.847
I had to kill her.
Side effect I'm working on.

1:22:18.947 --> 1:22:20.246
She couldn't handle a big load.

1:22:20.346 --> 1:22:22.806
Oh no. I need you
to start Veronica's heart.

1:22:22.906 --> 1:22:25.366
Oh, yeah, sure. Let me just
whip out my instant heart starter

1:22:25.465 --> 1:22:27.005
-and teleport it over.
-James, c'mon.

1:22:27.106 --> 1:22:29.566
The gun, I dunno?
Maybe just turn it on full?

1:22:29.666 --> 1:22:31.565
On full? I thought you said
that would kill someone.

1:22:31.665 --> 1:22:32.925
She's already dead.

1:22:33.025 --> 1:22:35.205
Okay, good point.
What's the worst that can happen?

1:22:35.304 --> 1:22:37.385
I dunno, okay? Maybe just, I don't know.

1:22:37.945 --> 1:22:40.604
Well, worst case, she could explode.

1:22:40.704 --> 1:22:42.924
-Explode?! Fuck!
-Could get messy.

1:22:43.023 --> 1:22:44.604
Just press it right up
to her chest. Maybe.

1:22:44.704 --> 1:22:47.964
Actually, I dunno, just do whatever
feels natural for you.

1:22:48.063 --> 1:22:50.463
Please work,
'cause I really, really like you.

1:23:11.821 --> 1:23:13.821
Veronica?

1:23:15.821 --> 1:23:18.420
Hey, Veronica. Hey.

1:23:21.099 --> 1:23:22.960
Hey.

1:23:23.059 --> 1:23:25.059
What happened?

1:23:25.380 --> 1:23:26.760
It's a long story.

1:23:26.860 --> 1:23:29.820
I'll explain it on the train ride home.

1:23:38.019 --> 1:23:40.419
Thank you, James. I really mean that.

1:23:41.178 --> 1:23:43.598
Really? I really appreciate that, Brad,

1:23:43.697 --> 1:23:45.838
'cause, you know, I just
feel really undervalued down here,

1:23:45.938 --> 1:23:47.758
and I feel like no one appreciates
all the work that I do,

1:23:47.858 --> 1:23:49.318
and I do so much around here,

1:23:49.418 --> 1:23:50.797
and people just think I'm this, like,

1:23:50.897 --> 1:23:54.257
really weird, creepy hacker… Brad?

1:23:55.777 --> 1:23:57.777

You just need to go for it, you know?

1:24:14.415 --> 1:24:17.474
And I feel like… I just really feel
like we have something here.

1:24:17.575 --> 1:24:18.715
I know I'm being forward.

1:24:18.815 --> 1:24:20.813
I do. I know I'm being forward, but…

1:24:21.813 --> 1:24:22.634
will you marry me?

1:24:22.733 --> 1:24:24.153
Don't say anything!
Don't say anything! Shh.

1:24:24.254 --> 1:24:26.994
Just feel it. Just feel it. Look at me.

1:24:27.094 --> 1:24:29.474
You are gonna love it down here.

1:24:29.574 --> 1:24:30.873
Shh, shh.

1:25:08.889 --> 1:25:10.889
How are we feeling?

1:25:12.489 --> 1:25:17.309
I feel good. I mean,
I feel really good, y'know?

1:25:17.409 --> 1:25:18.989
And Veronica?

1:25:19.089 --> 1:25:21.068
Oh, she's great, you know?

1:25:21.168 --> 1:25:24.068
Busy doing girl stuff, very busy.

1:25:24.168 --> 1:25:26.668
But, you know, organizing the wedding, so.

1:25:26.768 --> 1:25:28.308
She is, is she?

1:25:28.407 --> 1:25:30.728
[grunts]

1:25:31.287 --> 1:25:35.547
Yeah! And don't worry, okay?

1:25:35.647 --> 1:25:37.307
She is not gonna say anything.

1:25:37.407 --> 1:25:39.187
I mean, she really appreciates what I do.

1:25:39.287 --> 1:25:41.226
[laughs] The killing?

1:25:41.326 --> 1:25:43.885
All the killing, the spying, the lying.

1:25:44.766 --> 1:25:48.066
She doesn't mind you hanging out with
those super slender, sexy spy girls

1:25:48.166 --> 1:25:49.746
all the time?

1:25:49.846 --> 1:25:51.845
No, not a problem.

1:25:52.165 --> 1:25:54.105
Good for you.

1:25:54.205 --> 1:25:56.205
And her, I guess.

1:25:56.845 --> 1:25:58.184
Off to Russia you go.

1:25:58.285 --> 1:26:00.224
I know you hate these plutonium missions,

1:26:00.325 --> 1:26:02.584
but nobody knows the Russians
like you do, Bradly.

1:26:02.684 --> 1:26:06.784
It's actually my pleasure.
Not a problem. I got this.

1:26:06.884 --> 1:26:09.264
[laughs]

1:26:09.364 --> 1:26:12.103
So, I guess I should go.

1:26:12.202 --> 1:26:14.383
-Okay.
-Okay.

1:26:14.483 --> 1:26:18.903
-Oh, and this is for you.
-Oh.

1:26:19.003 --> 1:26:20.343
An invitation to my wedding.

1:26:20.443 --> 1:26:22.022
Wouldn't be the same without you.

1:26:22.121 --> 1:26:23.142
Aww.

1:26:23.242 --> 1:26:24.822
Oh, James is gonna be there.

1:26:24.922 --> 1:26:26.862
Really?

1:26:26.961 --> 1:26:29.782
Oh. Other James.

1:26:29.882 --> 1:26:31.880
Oh.

1:26:33.001 --> 1:26:34.861
-Of course.
-Yeah.

1:26:34.961 --> 1:26:37.281
He really needs a new toy shop, so…

1:26:38.281 --> 1:26:40.281
Sure. No problem.

1:26:41.240 --> 1:26:42.340
Bye, now.

1:26:42.440 --> 1:26:45.440
Enjoy Russia. I hear it's below 30.

1:26:46.800 --> 1:26:48.800
Minus 40, actually, Suzan.

1:26:49.320 --> 1:26:52.219
But you know what?
When you're as happy as I am,

1:26:52.318 --> 1:26:53.459
I mean, does it really matter?

1:26:53.559 --> 1:26:54.818
I don't think so.

1:26:54.919 --> 1:26:57.539
[laughs]

1:26:57.639 --> 1:26:59.099
Okay. Bye, Suzan.

1:26:59.199 --> 1:27:01.199
-Ta-ta.
-Okay. Okay, bye.

1:27:09.438 --> 1:27:11.437
[music crescendos, ends]

1:27:18.317 --> 1:27:20.317
[unintelligible garble across channels]

1:27:26.715 --> 1:27:28.896
[woman] Break.

1:27:28.996 --> 1:27:31.655
Not bad. How do you feel?

1:27:31.755 --> 1:27:35.695
I feel fucking great. So,
what's the deal with you and Walker?

1:27:35.795 --> 1:27:38.054
Oh, very good. [laughs]

1:27:38.155 --> 1:27:43.454
Hit him one way, he does the dishes.
Hit him another way, he gets so horny.

1:27:43.554 --> 1:27:46.974
Hit him again, he falls asleep!
He's the perfect man.

1:27:47.074 --> 1:27:49.174
You're just lucky
I haven't killed him yet.

1:27:49.273 --> 1:27:50.974
I kill you first!

1:27:51.074 --> 1:27:51.933
Bring it on.

1:27:52.032 --> 1:27:54.333
-Enough talking, let's get in the ring.
-Bring it.

1:27:54.433 --> 1:27:59.112
[women grunting]

1:28:01.273 --> 1:28:03.791
[fighting sounds continue]

1:28:10.352 --> 1:28:12.991
[beeping, whirring sounds]

1:28:46.228 --> 1:28:48.088
Brad?

1:28:48.188 --> 1:28:49.808
Lucy.

1:28:49.907 --> 1:28:51.647
Or should I say, Trident?

1:28:51.746 --> 1:28:52.967
Thought I had you there for a minute.

1:28:53.067 --> 1:28:54.407
Seriously, why?

1:28:54.507 --> 1:28:56.507
You know why.

1:28:56.987 --> 1:28:57.887
What, Mexico?

1:28:57.987 --> 1:28:59.327
You were supposed to have my back.

1:28:59.427 --> 1:29:01.806
I did have your back, Lucy.

1:29:01.906 --> 1:29:03.526
The minute that we finished the mission,

1:29:03.626 --> 1:29:06.406
you just had to have
a drinking competition with Mexicans!

1:29:06.505 --> 1:29:07.686
In Mexico.

1:29:07.786 --> 1:29:08.806
With tequila.

1:29:08.906 --> 1:29:11.206
Okay, I know what happened,
and that's not it.

1:29:11.306 --> 1:29:13.684
You know what, I don't think you do,
you were completely wasted.

1:29:13.785 --> 1:29:17.085
Do you remember falling in the fire
and nearly burning your face?

1:29:17.184 --> 1:29:19.804
You left me for dead. All of you.
You and the agency.

1:29:19.905 --> 1:29:22.844
No, we didn't, Lucy. I called the medevac.

1:29:22.943 --> 1:29:25.684
And then when you were so high
on peyote you dared yourself

1:29:25.784 --> 1:29:29.124
to jump out the helicopter into a river,
which you did by the way…

1:29:29.224 --> 1:29:31.124
Whatever. I don't wanna talk about it.

1:29:31.224 --> 1:29:36.383
Truth is, being a badass supervillain
is not as fun as it looks.

1:29:37.023 --> 1:29:40.883
I have a particular set of skills,
and I would like to use them more.

1:29:40.983 --> 1:29:43.922
Fine. What is it that you do want?

1:29:44.022 --> 1:29:46.022
I wanna come back.

1:29:46.782 --> 1:29:49.442
Wow. Okay. Let me get this right.

1:29:49.541 --> 1:29:51.722
You try and kill my fiancée,
you try and kill me,

1:29:51.822 --> 1:29:55.441
you try and take down the entire agency,
you team up with the Russians,

1:29:55.541 --> 1:29:57.701
and you steal hypersonic warheads.

1:29:58.501 --> 1:30:00.401
And now you wanna come back.

1:30:00.501 --> 1:30:02.500
Yes.

1:30:03.540 --> 1:30:05.440
Sure. I'll talk to Suzan.

1:30:05.540 --> 1:30:08.940
But you must promise to give back
all seven hypersonic missiles.

1:30:09.860 --> 1:30:11.679
Okay.

1:30:11.780 --> 1:30:12.999
Okay.

1:30:13.099 --> 1:30:15.079
-Fine.
-Fine.

1:30:15.179 --> 1:30:17.119
-Fine.
-Fine.

1:30:17.219 --> 1:30:18.079
Fine.

1:30:18.179 --> 1:30:20.179
Fine.

1:30:21.539 --> 1:30:23.538
Cool.

1:30:27.298 --> 1:30:28.318
What is it?

1:30:28.418 --> 1:30:30.418
It's an invitation to my wedding.

1:30:32.177 --> 1:30:34.277
No Russians, Lucy.

1:30:34.376 --> 1:30:35.836
Okay.

1:30:35.937 --> 1:30:37.937
Bye.

1:30:38.297 --> 1:30:40.297
Happy swimming!

1:30:50.496 --> 1:30:52.495
