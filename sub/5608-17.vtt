WEBVTT

00:11.187 --> 00:13.353
Thinking about getting
my hair cut short.

00:13.355 --> 00:14.588
That so?
Real short.

00:14.590 --> 00:16.857
So I could take my cap
on and off, like you can.

00:16.859 --> 00:18.058
Uh-huh.

00:18.060 --> 00:19.860
No more pinning it up
and sticking it in there.

00:19.862 --> 00:21.195
That's a pain.

00:21.197 --> 00:23.864
Plus a perp could grab it.
So it's also a liability.

00:23.866 --> 00:25.365
Except when
you're off duty,

00:25.367 --> 00:27.568
which is when it's just
a great head of hair.

00:27.570 --> 00:29.603
Thank you, Jamie.
And Eddie, believe me,

00:29.605 --> 00:33.040
when I say that really, truly,
that's all I got for the hair.

00:33.042 --> 00:34.975
That's more than I expected, actually.
Okay.

00:34.977 --> 00:37.177
Hey, Steve got
a new partner?

00:37.179 --> 00:40.314
Yeah, a newbie,
still on probation.

00:40.316 --> 00:43.150
Hey, Jamie, Eddie.
This is Marcus Beal.

00:43.152 --> 00:44.585
He just transferred in
from the 2-7.

00:44.587 --> 00:45.752
Hey.
Hey. Welcome.

00:45.754 --> 00:47.054
How's it going? Hey.
Nice to meet you.

00:47.056 --> 00:49.289
Give me a sec.
All right. I'll meet you out front.

00:49.291 --> 00:50.357
All right.

00:50.359 --> 00:51.625
Not wearing your vest.

00:51.627 --> 00:52.593
Yeah, I know.

00:52.595 --> 00:53.494
You should probably
go put one on.

00:53.496 --> 00:54.294
Naw, I'm good.

00:54.296 --> 00:55.529
No, go put one on.

00:55.531 --> 00:56.663
Am I missing something here?

00:56.665 --> 00:59.166
I... I thought my boss
was that Renzelli guy.

00:59.168 --> 01:00.367
Renzulli.

01:00.369 --> 01:01.935
It's department policy.
Everybody wears a vest.

01:01.937 --> 01:03.370
Policy huh?

01:03.372 --> 01:05.572
All right,
so you're one of those?

01:07.109 --> 01:08.942
Yeah, it's policy.

01:08.944 --> 01:11.945
And also, it's maybe life and
death, yours and your partner's.

01:11.947 --> 01:13.280
All right, well then,
you know...

01:13.282 --> 01:15.082
Steve can say something,
or the sarge can,

01:15.084 --> 01:17.451
but, you know, there's no policy
that says I gotta answer to you.

01:17.453 --> 01:18.619
All right?

01:23.225 --> 01:25.626
Rough Tough Creampuff.

01:25.628 --> 01:27.928
Above my pay grade.

01:27.930 --> 01:29.663
Never thought I'd actually
hear you say that.

01:29.665 --> 01:32.032
Lived and learned.

01:33.636 --> 01:34.902
Have you seen Anthony?

01:34.904 --> 01:36.503
I think he went down
to the break room.

01:36.505 --> 01:38.772
Break room? He owes me
a mountain of paperwork.

01:38.774 --> 01:39.907
You want me
to go get him?

01:39.909 --> 01:40.974
No, I'll go.

01:40.976 --> 01:43.210
And get the paperwork.
Two birds, one stone.

01:43.212 --> 01:44.912
Harry, you're not listening.

01:44.914 --> 01:46.480
Oh, no, no.
We're listening, okay?

01:46.482 --> 01:47.814
We're hearing him
loud and clear.

01:47.816 --> 01:49.283
He doesn't have
our money.

01:49.285 --> 01:50.384
I have what
you signed...

01:50.386 --> 01:51.618
I don't care
what I signed!

01:51.620 --> 01:53.053
You said the end
of the month.

01:53.055 --> 01:54.521
Come on, he's dead
to rights here.

01:54.523 --> 01:56.423
No, I told you that
I can't flip the property

01:56.425 --> 01:57.691
until after the closing.

01:57.693 --> 01:59.259
Now, you get your
profit when I flip,

01:59.261 --> 02:00.360
that's how it works.

02:00.362 --> 02:01.662
Profit?! Profit?!
That's what you signed!

02:01.664 --> 02:03.397
Forget about profit, Joe.
Forget about profit, okay?

02:03.399 --> 02:04.865
I just want
the money back.

02:04.867 --> 02:06.066
I can't believe
you vouched for this idiot.

02:06.068 --> 02:07.634
I can't believe
you forgot to tell us

02:07.636 --> 02:09.235
what a lying
scumbag he is.

02:09.238 --> 02:10.737
Okay, Harry, that's enough!
What's with the fingers, huh?!

02:10.739 --> 02:12.973
Hey!

02:12.975 --> 02:14.641
What's going on here?

02:14.643 --> 02:15.909
Small misunderstanding.

02:15.911 --> 02:17.311
100 grand ain't small.

02:17.313 --> 02:19.580
The situation's exactly
what he said it was.

02:19.582 --> 02:21.181
What is your problem?
My problem?

02:21.183 --> 02:23.150
You're ripping off cops.

02:23.152 --> 02:24.418
You got it coming.

02:24.420 --> 02:25.485
The both of you.
Oh, really?!

02:25.487 --> 02:26.753
Yeah!
Now it's a threat?!

02:26.755 --> 02:28.188
That was a threat!
You're going to threaten me?!

02:29.358 --> 02:30.724
Break it up!

02:30.726 --> 02:32.693
Both of you, upstairs.

02:38.267 --> 02:40.133
Hey. What are you doing here?

02:40.135 --> 02:41.935
Oh, I was thinking maybe
we could hit the range.

02:41.937 --> 02:44.238
You know I figured I owe you a
chance for a double or nothing.

02:44.240 --> 02:45.973
Double or nothing?
Last time was a scratch.

02:45.975 --> 02:48.275
Not a chance-- I had you
by three on the last sheet.

02:48.277 --> 02:49.776
I can't anyway.
I got plans.

02:49.778 --> 02:51.311
Plans with who, your couch?

02:52.448 --> 02:54.248
All right, fine,
whatever, rain check.

02:54.250 --> 02:56.350
You really came all the way
down here to settle a bet?

02:56.352 --> 02:57.784
Actually, no.

02:57.786 --> 03:00.754
You remember me telling you
about a Corporal Jimmy Beal?

03:00.756 --> 03:02.122
Yeah, he saved
your life in Iraq.

03:02.124 --> 03:03.023
More than once.

03:03.025 --> 03:04.124
His family's in Virginia.

03:04.126 --> 03:06.293
His widow is,
but his son's up here now.

03:06.295 --> 03:08.862
And I want you
to mentor him.

03:08.864 --> 03:10.430
Mentor him?
Yeah.

03:10.432 --> 03:12.566
He just graduated the Academy
a couple months ago.

03:12.568 --> 03:14.768
All right, well how
come me and not you?

03:14.770 --> 03:17.271
'Cause he was transferred
to your precinct.

03:17.273 --> 03:18.839
There he is right now.

03:18.841 --> 03:20.173
Hey!

03:20.175 --> 03:21.441
Uncle Danny!

03:21.443 --> 03:22.809
What are you
doing here?

03:22.811 --> 03:24.544
Just checking up on you.

03:24.546 --> 03:26.413
Marcus this
is my kid brother, Jamie.

03:26.415 --> 03:28.048
Jamie, this is Marcus.

03:29.385 --> 03:30.884
He's your brother?

03:30.886 --> 03:33.220
Oh, you two have met.

03:33.222 --> 03:35.622
Yeah.
Okay.

03:35.624 --> 03:37.824
Well, whatever the hell happened
between the two of you,

03:37.826 --> 03:40.527
let's say we take
a mulligan, okay?

03:43.599 --> 03:44.965
Okay?

03:46.168 --> 03:47.768
Okay.

03:47.770 --> 03:50.070
Okay.
Good.

04:00.149 --> 04:01.581
Thank you.

04:01.583 --> 04:04.418
Please, sit down.

04:09.825 --> 04:11.391
Well, let's see.

04:11.393 --> 04:13.994
Deputy Director Harold Kellen
of MI5,

04:13.996 --> 04:17.029
Deputy Commissioner Roger
Thornton, Metropolitan Police,

04:17.031 --> 04:21.401
Commander Sloane Thompson,
of the City of London Police.

04:21.403 --> 04:22.669
Welcome.

04:22.671 --> 04:25.872
You are, uh,
going to be seeing things

04:25.874 --> 04:28.875
out in the field
over the next couple of days.

04:28.877 --> 04:31.345
You're going
to have questions answered

04:31.347 --> 04:34.715
and perhaps even
suspicions confirmed

04:34.717 --> 04:35.916
that go to the heart

04:35.918 --> 04:38.018
of how we protect our city
and our way of life

04:38.020 --> 04:41.855
from the terrorists who would
stop at nothing to destroy it--

04:41.857 --> 04:44.524
or your own London as well.

04:44.526 --> 04:47.327
Any pictures that you take,
any notes that you make,

04:47.329 --> 04:49.262
electronic or otherwise,

04:49.264 --> 04:54.000
need to be vetted
thoroughly by us, are we agreed?

04:54.002 --> 04:55.335
Of course, Commissioner.

04:55.337 --> 04:57.137
I prefer to keep it
all up here in my head.

04:57.139 --> 04:58.372
Photographic memory?

04:58.374 --> 04:59.539
I've always found

04:59.541 --> 05:01.775
that the really vital stuff
tends to stick.

05:04.680 --> 05:05.712
Commander Thompson?

05:05.714 --> 05:07.013
Agreed.
Good.

05:07.015 --> 05:08.482
Thank you.

05:08.484 --> 05:10.751
And quite clever, that,
if I may say so.

05:10.753 --> 05:12.586
That what?

05:12.588 --> 05:14.788
That for-your-eyes-only
bit just then.

05:14.790 --> 05:16.223
As if we're going to be privy

05:16.225 --> 05:19.693
to your drone-strike protocols
and electro-shock treatments.

05:19.695 --> 05:20.861
Well, I assure you,

05:20.863 --> 05:22.429
we don't have those
capabilities, Commander.

05:22.431 --> 05:23.797
But we're not really
going to see

05:23.799 --> 05:26.767
the capabilities
you do have, now are we?

05:28.103 --> 05:29.102
Commander?

05:29.104 --> 05:30.804
I would like to go
on record here...

05:30.806 --> 05:32.139
As being presumptuous?

05:32.141 --> 05:35.242
As having been promised
straight whiskey,

05:35.244 --> 05:39.746
but fearing that I'm being
served with weak tea.

05:41.950 --> 05:44.384
And what makes you think that,
Commander?

05:44.386 --> 05:46.720
I've done some homework,
Commissioner Reagan.

05:46.722 --> 05:50.090
I've spoken to a number
of private-sector security heads

05:50.092 --> 05:53.493
who've attended
your SHIELD program.

05:53.495 --> 05:55.429
Another program
we're very proud of.

05:55.431 --> 05:59.566
But the breadth of access
to your department and its works

05:59.568 --> 06:02.235
appears to me
to line up almost exactly

06:02.237 --> 06:04.037
with that
of the SHIELD program...

06:04.039 --> 06:05.705
Sloane, for God's sake.
No.

06:05.707 --> 06:06.873
Let her go.

06:06.875 --> 06:09.109
As if London and her citizens

06:09.111 --> 06:11.978
and her landmarks
deserve no more

06:11.980 --> 06:14.281
of your insight
and expertise

06:14.283 --> 06:17.017
than a hotel chain
or an investment bank,

06:17.019 --> 06:18.218
a pharmaceutical firm,

06:18.220 --> 06:21.221
the entities
for whom SHIELD is designed.

06:21.223 --> 06:22.489
Well, your homework's
incomplete.

06:22.491 --> 06:24.090
That's just not true.

06:24.092 --> 06:25.425
I sincerely hope

06:25.427 --> 06:27.761
that by the time we leave here
tomorrow night,

06:27.763 --> 06:32.265
you will have shared with us
what you truly dread,

06:32.267 --> 06:35.569
what you're prepared to do
about what you truly dread,

06:35.571 --> 06:39.306
what you know
that no one else does.

06:42.444 --> 06:47.113
Well, I can tell you one thing
the Irish in me truly dreads.

06:47.115 --> 06:51.284

Thanks for waiting.

Look, what you
walked in on

07:29.669 --> 07:32.904
was between me and Anthony
and his Bernie Madoff wannabe.

07:32.906 --> 07:34.639
Don't start.
What I walked in on

07:34.641 --> 07:37.375
was a beef about money,
and I want it settled in-house.

07:37.377 --> 07:39.577
So start talking.

07:39.579 --> 07:41.412
Anthony here got me
to go in on

07:41.414 --> 07:43.981
a real estate deal
with his pal, Joey.

07:43.983 --> 07:47.185
Only I'm starting to think these
properties don't even exist.

07:47.187 --> 07:48.553
You saw them yourself.

07:48.555 --> 07:49.720
I saw some condos, yeah.

07:49.722 --> 07:51.155
What I haven't seen
is any money.

07:51.157 --> 07:53.257
You agreed to tie it up
until the closing,

07:53.259 --> 07:55.660
the date of which
is out of his control.

07:55.662 --> 07:57.228
I asked around.

07:57.230 --> 08:00.565
Joey messed with some charity
funds at the 6-4 precinct.

08:00.567 --> 08:01.399
You got proof?

08:01.401 --> 08:02.366
I got word.

08:02.368 --> 08:04.702
You ask them yourself.

08:04.704 --> 08:06.103
I will.

08:06.105 --> 08:08.406
You're just trying to run out
on the contract you signed.

08:08.408 --> 08:11.876
What, your, uh, self-respect
retire when you did?

08:11.878 --> 08:16.214
You know, if you want to talk
to me, you give me a call.

08:16.216 --> 08:19.317
But I'm done sitting here
with this Judas.

08:24.724 --> 08:26.624
Joey's digits?

08:26.626 --> 08:29.227
Erin, this guy's not a crook.

08:29.229 --> 08:30.428
How long you know Joey?

08:30.430 --> 08:32.263
All my life. He's my cousin.

08:32.265 --> 08:34.599
He's family?

08:34.601 --> 08:36.767
Close as brothers. Closer even.

08:44.210 --> 08:45.343
Uncle Danny?

08:45.345 --> 08:46.577
I could be wrong,

08:46.579 --> 08:48.179
but I think the kid even wears
the same aftershave.

08:49.382 --> 08:51.582
So why is your brother trying
to pawn him off on you?

08:51.584 --> 08:54.151
His way of spreading
the love around, I guess.

08:54.153 --> 08:55.853
Reagan!

08:55.855 --> 08:58.222
Ooh, I don't
envy your day.

08:58.224 --> 08:59.323
Ready to go?

08:59.325 --> 09:00.691
Ready as I'm gonna be.

09:00.693 --> 09:02.860
I got my vest on,
so I'll protect you out there.

09:02.862 --> 09:03.928
Good to know.

09:03.930 --> 09:06.998
Lighten up, man. Come on.

09:07.000 --> 09:09.867
Look, you're the one
who requested me, remember?

09:09.869 --> 09:11.235
Because he's trying
to help you.

09:11.237 --> 09:13.671
Well, I don't need help.

09:13.673 --> 09:15.873
Right. You got it
all figured out.

09:15.875 --> 09:17.575
Eddie.

09:17.577 --> 09:20.478
I'm gonna go
and try and find Steve.

09:20.480 --> 09:23.347
You guys be safe
out there today.

09:23.349 --> 09:25.783
Now her I wouldn't mind
riding with.

09:25.785 --> 09:28.052
That right?

09:28.054 --> 09:29.554
What's her deal?
She single?

09:29.556 --> 09:31.188
Why don't you ask her?

09:31.190 --> 09:33.057
I'm asking you.

09:33.059 --> 09:34.859
Next subject.

09:34.861 --> 09:36.994
Are you really
Danny's brother?

09:36.996 --> 09:39.230
'Cause you guys are
some kind of opposite.

09:39.232 --> 09:41.399
We have our differences.

09:41.401 --> 09:43.100
You've known Danny
a long time?

09:43.102 --> 09:44.702
Yeah, yeah,
since I was a kid.

09:44.704 --> 09:45.970
He helped my mom out a lot

09:45.972 --> 09:48.105
when my Dad didn't
come back from Iraq.

09:48.107 --> 09:51.175
That's good.
Danny's a stand-up guy.

09:51.177 --> 09:53.344
Yeah.
But you're riding with me today,

09:53.346 --> 09:55.846
so I'm not gonna lecture you
or tell you what to do,

09:55.848 --> 09:57.748
but I got six years
on the job.

09:57.750 --> 09:59.216
I can share
some experience.

09:59.218 --> 10:01.519
Which is your way of telling me
you're gonna school me.

10:01.521 --> 10:02.987
Just trying to make this day

10:02.989 --> 10:05.456
productive for both of us,
all right?

10:11.464 --> 10:13.631
Harry was telling the truth.

10:13.633 --> 10:14.966
There are allegations

10:14.968 --> 10:17.368
your cousin scammed
a fundraiser at the 6-4.

10:17.370 --> 10:20.137
Allegations aren't charges.

10:20.139 --> 10:22.306
He made good.
Three months late.

10:22.308 --> 10:23.507
And only after serious threats

10:23.509 --> 10:24.909
were made to his health
and well-being.

10:24.911 --> 10:27.011
That's just talk.

10:27.013 --> 10:28.946
Once bitten, twice shy.

10:30.450 --> 10:32.049
What does that mean?

10:34.320 --> 10:36.087
It means I'm gonna
dig into this.

10:36.089 --> 10:38.222
And I'm telling you because
I don't want you to think

10:38.224 --> 10:39.824
I'm going after family

10:39.826 --> 10:40.858
behind your back.

10:40.860 --> 10:42.426
But you are
going after my family.

10:42.428 --> 10:43.828
I am going after

10:43.830 --> 10:47.665
an individual who may be using
his connections in this office

10:47.667 --> 10:49.734
to scam other people
in this office.

10:49.736 --> 10:50.901
You think
I'd do that?

10:50.903 --> 10:53.237
I'd allow that?
No.

10:53.239 --> 10:56.374
I'm not certain
that you are aware.

10:56.376 --> 10:59.176
Oh, so now what?
You're calling me stupid.

11:01.014 --> 11:03.014
Did you hook Joey up at the 6-4?

11:03.016 --> 11:04.248
No.

11:04.250 --> 11:06.083
No?

11:07.220 --> 11:10.021
Our second cousin Ralph's
a sergeant up there.

11:13.826 --> 11:15.526
You'll stay out of this.

11:16.329 --> 11:17.762
No.

11:17.764 --> 11:20.164
It's not really a question.
I want in.

11:20.166 --> 11:22.266
He's your cousin, Anthony.

11:22.268 --> 11:23.801
And I'm 100% certain
he's innocent.

11:23.803 --> 11:26.570
But if one of my family's
accused of something like this,

11:26.572 --> 11:28.506
then I think
another one of my family

11:28.508 --> 11:30.408
deserves a chance
to clear his name.

11:30.410 --> 11:32.843
And what if the facts
fall otherwise?

11:32.845 --> 11:35.546
I'd arrest my own mother if
I thought she was scamming cops.

11:35.548 --> 11:36.981
Your own mother.

11:37.784 --> 11:40.484
Well, with a lot of back-up.

11:42.655 --> 11:45.856
Please, Erin, don't insult me.

11:50.630 --> 11:53.030
I won't.

11:55.835 --> 11:58.669
Okay, yeah,
this place is legit.

11:58.671 --> 12:00.271
This place is legit.

12:00.273 --> 12:01.639
Yeah, that's all
Eddie-- she's like

12:01.641 --> 12:03.274
a walking Michelin Guide
for cheap eats.

12:03.276 --> 12:04.508
Oh, yeah? See?

12:04.510 --> 12:07.878
Now that's the kind
of experience I can learn from.

12:07.880 --> 12:09.313
Yeah.

12:09.315 --> 12:10.881
All units, be advised.

12:10.883 --> 12:14.151
We have a 10-20,
corner of Houston and Jones.

12:14.153 --> 12:16.454
Perp is a male, white,
wearing a red hoodie.

12:16.456 --> 12:18.322
That's up the block.

12:19.726 --> 12:20.591
Yo, there he is.

12:20.593 --> 12:21.692
Wait, hold on.
Sit tight.

12:21.694 --> 12:22.760
We'll spin around
and get him...

12:22.762 --> 12:23.894
Stop! Police!
I said sit tight!

12:23.896 --> 12:25.162
Move it! Stop!

12:26.499 --> 12:28.265
Stop! Police!

12:29.168 --> 12:29.934
Hey!

12:29.936 --> 12:31.402
Hey!

12:32.038 --> 12:33.404
Watch out!
Hey!

12:37.009 --> 12:39.043
Don't move!

12:39.045 --> 12:40.177
Ow! Okay, okay!

12:40.179 --> 12:41.812
Okay!

12:41.814 --> 12:45.216
Turn over! Turn over!

12:46.352 --> 12:47.985
I'm going
to turn you over, okay?

12:50.957 --> 12:52.923
Where you going, bro, huh?

12:52.925 --> 12:54.592
Hey, call a bus!

12:59.832 --> 13:01.031
<i>The fact is</i>

13:01.033 --> 13:03.400
that Edward Snowden
set us way, way back

13:03.402 --> 13:06.704
in terms of our ability
to harvest Intel.

13:06.706 --> 13:09.039
How much of that setback
do your open sources shore up?

13:09.041 --> 13:13.744
Hard to, if not impossible,
to put a yardstick on that.

13:13.746 --> 13:15.246
Could you try?

13:15.248 --> 13:17.448
Well, say we get a call.

13:17.450 --> 13:19.583
Guy buys X amount of fertilizer.

13:19.585 --> 13:22.086
A guy who's address
is an apartment

13:22.088 --> 13:24.989
in the city who has no normal
need for X amount of fertilizer.

13:24.991 --> 13:26.123
He also buys

13:26.125 --> 13:29.426
nine pressure cookers
in the next state over,

13:29.428 --> 13:31.729
and we get that call, too.

13:31.731 --> 13:32.930
You want that guy.

13:32.932 --> 13:34.598
And we'll get that guy.

13:34.600 --> 13:40.504
But the guy we'll miss drove
an SUV packed with AK-47's

13:40.506 --> 13:42.640
up the east coast.

13:42.642 --> 13:44.074
And we will miss him
because we do not have

13:44.076 --> 13:47.344
a cooperating merchant
or a CI to call it in.

13:47.346 --> 13:50.681
Pretty big hole in the net.
Thank you, Commander Obvious.

13:50.683 --> 13:53.217
Well, it is a pretty big
hole in the net.

13:53.219 --> 13:57.154
But I expect it's more
our problem than yours.

13:57.156 --> 13:59.156
From what I can tell,
your telecoms

13:59.158 --> 14:02.793
don't have the same restrictions
put on them as ours.

14:02.795 --> 14:06.430
You can scrub communications
that we can't touch

14:06.432 --> 14:08.833
without miles of red tape.

14:08.835 --> 14:11.635
Too little too late.

14:11.637 --> 14:14.305
In the name of what? Privacy?

14:15.775 --> 14:17.141
Not gonna go there.

14:17.143 --> 14:18.242
Commissioner,
we want to thank you

14:18.244 --> 14:19.677
for this most illuminating
couple of days.

14:19.679 --> 14:21.178
Just-Just a minute here.

14:21.180 --> 14:23.814
Commander Thompson.

14:23.816 --> 14:24.849
Commissioner?

14:24.851 --> 14:26.951
You asked me

14:26.953 --> 14:29.019
what I dread the most?

14:29.822 --> 14:32.223
Yes.

14:34.093 --> 14:36.060
The Paris attacks.

14:36.062 --> 14:38.229
How low tech they were.

14:38.231 --> 14:41.599
A handful of actors
whose whole plot

14:41.601 --> 14:44.668
consisted of synchronizing
their watches

14:44.670 --> 14:48.138
to the tick of the clock
on a nothing Friday night.

14:52.945 --> 14:55.613
But you still think
I'm holding back?

14:55.615 --> 14:57.147
Yes, I do.
Really, Sloane.

14:57.149 --> 14:59.083
Excuse us, Commissioner, we're late
for a meeting at the consulate.

14:59.085 --> 15:00.384
Wouldn't want
to keep them waiting.

15:00.386 --> 15:02.386
You say that
you're restricted

15:02.388 --> 15:04.588
by law from scrubbing
cellular communications,

15:04.590 --> 15:06.991
from a take-no-prisoners
approach to the surveillance

15:06.993 --> 15:08.392
of Muslim communities,

15:08.394 --> 15:10.594
of their mosques,

15:10.596 --> 15:13.530
and you just stop there?

15:13.532 --> 15:16.033
You're asking us
to believe

15:16.035 --> 15:19.370
that you haven't
found ways under and around.

15:19.372 --> 15:22.640
You don't have
black-ops procedures that, uh,

15:22.642 --> 15:25.776
might aid our efforts
were you to share them?

15:27.446 --> 15:29.680
That's a very smart question.

15:33.586 --> 15:35.386
And so you're
smart enough to know

15:35.388 --> 15:38.522
that that is a question
that I cannot answer.

15:40.493 --> 15:42.059
So there we are.

15:42.061 --> 15:44.561
Very well, then.

15:51.103 --> 15:53.871
Sorry to disappoint you,
Commander.

15:53.873 --> 15:54.972
Not at all, Commissioner.

15:54.974 --> 15:57.141
Just trying to do my job.

15:57.143 --> 15:59.743
Safe travels.

16:11.375 --> 16:13.732
So Rough Tough Creampuff
made a collar.

16:13.931 --> 16:15.497
Yeah, and ignored
my directions to sit tight

16:15.499 --> 16:17.499
and sent a little girl
to the hospital in the process.

16:17.501 --> 16:19.401
All of a sudden,
so I'm booking down the street,

16:19.403 --> 16:21.603
mad fast, I'm running
full speed, people coming out,

16:21.605 --> 16:22.904
pushing people out of the way,

16:22.906 --> 16:24.539
all of a sudden,
this woman

16:24.541 --> 16:25.974
with a stroller just
comes out of nowhere,

16:25.976 --> 16:27.275
just comes straight
out of nowhere, man.

16:27.277 --> 16:29.411
I'm going so fast,
though, so I just jump

16:29.413 --> 16:30.946
right over the stroller.

16:30.948 --> 16:32.480
Cab comes,

16:32.482 --> 16:34.115
knocks the perp onto
the hood, I dive,

16:34.117 --> 16:35.917
crack him over the hood
like T.J. Hooker.

16:35.919 --> 16:38.787
Boom. Take him down. Done.
Track star.

16:38.789 --> 16:40.355
Hand to God.
Hand to God.

16:40.357 --> 16:41.957
Good job, partner.

16:41.959 --> 16:43.291
Yeah, you
feeling lucky to have me?

16:43.293 --> 16:44.526
I don't know about that.

16:44.528 --> 16:45.894
But congratulations on
your first collar at the 12th.

16:45.896 --> 16:48.063
Huh?
Thank you. Thank you.

16:48.065 --> 16:49.731
Thank you.
We gotta talk.

16:51.101 --> 16:53.802
No, I'm guessing you're the one
that needs to talk.

16:55.038 --> 16:58.306
Yeah, because you put a little
girl in the hospital today.

16:58.308 --> 16:59.708
Oh, man.
It was an accident.

16:59.710 --> 17:02.177
She got, what? A stich?

17:02.179 --> 17:04.212
A dozen.
Because of your recklessness.

17:04.214 --> 17:07.949
Are you seriously trying
to teach me lessons? Now?

17:07.951 --> 17:09.584
I'm not teaching,
I'm telling.

17:09.586 --> 17:12.520
I was the senior officer, I made
a call, and you ignored it.

17:12.521 --> 17:14.256
'Cause it was the wrong call.
The perp would have got away.

17:14.258 --> 17:15.357
What if he had a gun?
There was a whole crowd

17:15.358 --> 17:16.424
of people standing right there.

17:16.425 --> 17:17.826
You know what? I acted,
you didn't, okay?

17:17.828 --> 17:19.394
You're just mad because
the rookie made the collar

17:19.396 --> 17:20.528
and not the six-year veteran.

17:20.530 --> 17:21.396
Hey, this isn't about me.

17:21.397 --> 17:23.064
You know,
whatever you say.

17:23.066 --> 17:24.965
Hey, why don't you listen to someone
besides yourself for a change?!

17:24.968 --> 17:26.835
You gave that kid's family
a hell of a scare.

17:26.837 --> 17:28.203
The only one who was
scared was you!

17:28.204 --> 17:29.471
Now get out of my face!
All right! That's enough!

17:29.473 --> 17:31.439
That's enough!

17:31.441 --> 17:33.375
Ooh...

17:33.377 --> 17:39.281
I seriously can't believe
you're Danny Reagan's brother.

17:40.984 --> 17:43.918
That? That's above
your pay grade.

17:43.920 --> 17:46.454
You got that right.
Screw it.

17:57.668 --> 17:58.700
Hi.

17:58.702 --> 18:00.535
Hi.

18:00.537 --> 18:02.637
Sunday dinner.

18:02.639 --> 18:05.840
Ooh. What are we having?

18:08.545 --> 18:10.078
Turducken.

18:10.080 --> 18:11.479
Really?
Yeah, Nicky's idea.

18:11.481 --> 18:14.482
Ordered it special
from New Orleans.

18:16.219 --> 18:18.453
I've always wanted
to try that.

18:18.455 --> 18:20.889
And Sunday
you will have your chance.

18:20.891 --> 18:23.358
I'll get these.

18:27.397 --> 18:29.331
Give me an honest answer.

18:29.333 --> 18:31.166
Never.

18:33.837 --> 18:36.438
Have I become
too cynical?

18:36.440 --> 18:38.206
Of course not.
I think my job

18:38.208 --> 18:42.143
makes me assume
the worst in people.

18:42.145 --> 18:45.213
Nah, you're a realist.
Goes with the job.

18:45.215 --> 18:48.016
But maybe to a fault?

18:49.619 --> 18:51.119
What's going on?

18:52.723 --> 18:55.824
I have to investigate...

18:55.826 --> 18:57.959
a detective's cousin.

18:57.961 --> 19:00.261
A detective I work
with closely.

19:00.263 --> 19:01.529
Anthony?

19:01.531 --> 19:03.064
His cousin's been accused

19:03.066 --> 19:06.801
of scamming cops
with bogus investments.

19:06.803 --> 19:08.570
And you're just looking into it.

19:08.572 --> 19:11.106
That goes with the job,
doesn't mean you're a cynic.

19:11.108 --> 19:13.341
Yeah, it's not
that part, though.

19:13.343 --> 19:16.644
See, Anthony has insisted
on digging into it with me,

19:16.646 --> 19:20.682
even though it's his cousin,
and one that's like a brother.

19:20.684 --> 19:23.952
And you have doubts
about his real intentions.

19:23.954 --> 19:26.087
Yes.

19:26.089 --> 19:28.123
Now, I know this man.

19:28.125 --> 19:30.125
Anthony is a good guy.

19:30.127 --> 19:32.694
But there's something
in me that just...

19:34.231 --> 19:37.132
...assumes the worst.

19:38.635 --> 19:40.335
Well...

19:40.337 --> 19:42.303
better to be
teaching the hard way

19:42.305 --> 19:44.706
than learning the hard way.

19:48.745 --> 19:50.178
No, and I should have
called ahead.

19:50.180 --> 19:51.546
He should be here
any minute.

19:51.548 --> 19:53.281
If you could let the
commissioner know that I'll...

19:53.283 --> 19:54.616
- Hello.
- Oh, no need.

19:55.552 --> 19:57.285
Sorry, I was out
at a crime scene.

19:57.287 --> 20:01.322
Yes, um, and, uh, sorry
to just pop in like this.

20:01.324 --> 20:04.225
Well, here we are.

20:04.227 --> 20:05.660
Indeed.

20:07.130 --> 20:09.998
I've come to apologize.

20:10.000 --> 20:13.134
You don't have anything
to apologize for.

20:13.136 --> 20:14.502
Apparently I do.

20:14.504 --> 20:17.772
Apparently I was rude
and interruptive,

20:17.774 --> 20:22.010
and apparently I overstepped
any number of boundaries.

20:22.012 --> 20:23.244
And judging from all

20:23.246 --> 20:24.512
these “apparentlys”,

20:24.514 --> 20:27.582
apparently this apology
is an order from above.

20:27.584 --> 20:29.417
A suggestion, sir.

20:29.419 --> 20:31.753
Where are Frick and Frack?

20:33.223 --> 20:34.756
Washington.

20:34.758 --> 20:38.626
I've been disinvited
from that leg of the trip.

20:38.628 --> 20:40.862
Because of your lack of manners.

20:40.864 --> 20:44.265
Look, uh... I know
how I come across.

20:44.267 --> 20:47.135
I'm passionate
about police work,

20:47.137 --> 20:49.737
and police work
has a ticking clock on it,

20:49.739 --> 20:52.540
as lives are at stake,
and that makes me

20:52.542 --> 20:55.510
impatient to get what I need,

20:55.512 --> 21:00.281
which often results
in my having to apologize.

21:00.283 --> 21:03.852
Anyway, I don't want to waste
any more of your time, so...

21:05.755 --> 21:07.288
All right. Okay. Uh...

21:09.292 --> 21:11.159
So again, uh, sorry.

21:11.161 --> 21:13.428
And thank you.

21:13.430 --> 21:14.996
It's been informative.

21:17.801 --> 21:19.834
Erin, I hear what
you're saying, but maybe...

21:19.836 --> 21:21.603
You wanted in
on the investigation,

21:21.605 --> 21:22.904
this is what it is.

21:22.906 --> 21:24.239
Yeah, I understand that.

21:24.241 --> 21:25.874
But maybe...
Ramus was in on

21:25.876 --> 21:27.475
a dozen developments
with Joey.

21:27.477 --> 21:29.410
Yeah.
Until the car crash.

21:29.412 --> 21:32.280
Yeah, so, if anything was going
on, maybe she knows about it.

21:32.282 --> 21:34.983
Just seems a little dark,
you know?

21:34.985 --> 21:36.784
Digging into this widow
on a whim.

21:36.786 --> 21:38.353
It's not a whim.

21:38.355 --> 21:40.655
But with all the money
he was moving,

21:40.657 --> 21:43.258
I'm a little surprised
the house isn't nicer.

21:44.828 --> 21:47.996
Just go easy, okay? Please?

21:53.103 --> 21:54.802
Erika Ramus?
Yes?

21:54.804 --> 21:56.437
ADA Erin Reagan,

21:56.439 --> 22:00.842
this is Investigator Abetemarco
from the DA's office.

22:00.844 --> 22:03.545
We have some questions about
Joey Ruscoli. You know him?

22:03.547 --> 22:05.747
Yeah.
He's a family friend.

22:05.749 --> 22:07.015
We understand that he

22:07.017 --> 22:09.984
and your late husband
were business partners.

22:09.986 --> 22:12.554
They were.
I'm sorry, what's this about?

22:12.556 --> 22:14.055
Well, there's
been some

22:14.057 --> 22:18.593
unsubstantiated allegations
over Joey's business practices.

22:18.595 --> 22:20.662
Fraud, in fact.

22:20.664 --> 22:22.163
I don't know
anything about that.

22:22.165 --> 22:23.631
So, in all
your husband's

22:23.633 --> 22:25.633
business ventures
you never noticed

22:25.635 --> 22:28.803
anything suspicious
or illegal?

22:28.805 --> 22:30.872
Reagan.
Wait.

22:30.874 --> 22:33.241
Is this about Joey
or my husband?

22:33.243 --> 22:35.777
Maybe both.

22:35.779 --> 22:37.645
Will you excuse me a minute?

22:44.187 --> 22:46.621
Look, it's been hard
losing Andrew,

22:46.623 --> 22:48.590
but Joey's been a light.

22:48.592 --> 22:50.558
Whatever...

22:50.560 --> 22:51.759
Whoever you think he is,

22:51.761 --> 22:53.962
I'm telling you
you're wrong about it.

22:53.964 --> 22:57.265
And my husband was
the most honest man I ever knew.

23:00.070 --> 23:01.202
Thank you for your time.

23:02.606 --> 23:05.707
Well, I guess we're gonna
have to look elsewhere.

23:05.709 --> 23:07.575
Really, Erin?
What?

23:07.577 --> 23:11.079
You know, it's okay to be
wrong once in a while.

23:24.160 --> 23:25.393
Hey.

23:25.395 --> 23:26.995
Hey, I didn't hear you.

23:26.997 --> 23:28.496
Double or nothing still?

23:28.498 --> 23:30.798
Sure.

23:30.800 --> 23:32.400
Heard you and Marcus
got into it.

23:32.402 --> 23:33.835
Yeah, he knocked
a little kid down.

23:33.837 --> 23:36.270
Sent her to the hospital
while he was making an arrest.

23:36.272 --> 23:37.372
Bad luck?

23:37.374 --> 23:39.240
Bad policing, Danny.

23:39.242 --> 23:40.642
Only happened because he ignored

23:40.644 --> 23:42.710
the plan of a more experienced
police officer--

23:42.712 --> 23:44.445
namely, me.

23:44.447 --> 23:45.647
Huh. He told me

23:45.649 --> 23:47.248
it was a good collar.

23:47.250 --> 23:48.483
Did he?

23:48.485 --> 23:50.551
Yeah. We both know
how you can be.

23:50.553 --> 23:52.387
How <i> I</i> can be?

23:52.389 --> 23:54.322
Yeah, you know,
Mr. By-The-Book.

23:54.324 --> 23:56.524
Like you wrote
the Patrol Guide yourself.

23:57.360 --> 23:59.861
Something wrong with that?

23:59.863 --> 24:01.062
I'm just saying

24:01.064 --> 24:02.463
the kid's got good instincts.

24:02.465 --> 24:04.198
You shouldn't hold him back.

24:04.200 --> 24:06.601
Are his “good instincts” why you
had him placed in my precinct?

24:06.603 --> 24:08.302
What do you mean?

24:10.607 --> 24:12.006
That means you knew
he was a liability, Danny.

24:12.008 --> 24:13.341
You-You're trying
to protect him.

24:13.343 --> 24:15.376
You're damn right
I'm trying to protect him.

24:15.378 --> 24:16.310
Yeah, at my expense.

24:16.312 --> 24:17.679
What are you
worried about anyway?

24:17.681 --> 24:18.880
You worried about

24:18.882 --> 24:20.815
your golden boy reputation
being tarnished?

24:20.817 --> 24:22.116
Is that it?
Whatever, Danny.

24:22.118 --> 24:23.418
Whatever?
Look, you don't want

24:23.420 --> 24:25.553
to help the kid, don't help him.

24:25.555 --> 24:27.822
There's a reason
there's a Patrol Guide, Danny.

24:27.824 --> 24:29.323
Keeps guys alive.

24:29.325 --> 24:30.591
Yeah, you know what

24:30.593 --> 24:31.759
doesn't keep guys alive?

24:31.761 --> 24:33.061
Hesitating.

24:33.063 --> 24:35.563
Weighing the options
when there's only one option.

24:35.565 --> 24:37.231
To act.

24:42.238 --> 24:43.838
You know, you're part
of his problem, Danny.

24:43.840 --> 24:45.640
Maybe you're part
of the problem.

24:45.642 --> 24:47.575
Your example's
made him reckless.

24:47.577 --> 24:49.377
He's gonna get somebody killed.

24:52.515 --> 24:54.182
Are we even?

24:54.984 --> 24:57.885
Not by a long shot.

25:06.096 --> 25:09.230
There's a woman here
to see you-- Erika Ramus?

25:10.600 --> 25:12.567
Send her in. Cameron?

25:13.369 --> 25:14.736
Get Anthony up here, please.

25:18.908 --> 25:20.541
I didn't sleep a wink
last night.

25:20.543 --> 25:21.642
If I...

25:21.644 --> 25:22.777
overstepped yesterday...

25:22.779 --> 25:23.845
You didn't.

25:23.847 --> 25:25.279
You were looking for the truth,

25:25.281 --> 25:28.549
and I didn't give it to you.

25:28.551 --> 25:29.751
What's this?

25:29.753 --> 25:31.119
Records.

25:31.121 --> 25:33.054
Cancelled checks,
bounced checks,

25:33.056 --> 25:34.889
receipts, bogus receipts--

25:34.891 --> 25:38.593
anything my husband kept
on his transactions with Joey.

25:38.595 --> 25:39.761
Are you saying...

25:39.763 --> 25:41.996
None of it was real.

25:42.799 --> 25:43.965
Andrew didn't realize

25:43.967 --> 25:46.200
until it was too late.

25:46.202 --> 25:47.769
We lost everything.

25:47.771 --> 25:50.538
I mean...

25:50.540 --> 25:52.874
Well, everything.

25:52.876 --> 25:55.243
He couldn't live with it.

25:55.245 --> 25:56.844
The car accident?

25:58.114 --> 26:00.148
Wasn't an accident.

26:01.284 --> 26:02.984
What's the word, E?

26:02.986 --> 26:04.986
Oh, excuse me.

26:04.988 --> 26:07.155
Why didn't you tell us?

26:08.424 --> 26:10.558
After my husband died...

26:10.560 --> 26:12.593
Joey helped.

26:13.663 --> 26:15.596
Believe me, I wanted nothing
to do with him,

26:15.598 --> 26:18.533
but the kids need to eat.

26:20.904 --> 26:23.671
As long as I kept quiet,
the money kept coming.

26:23.673 --> 26:24.939
Quiet about the scams?

26:24.941 --> 26:27.074
Uh, but you said
he was a family friend.

26:27.076 --> 26:29.210
He told me to say that.

26:29.212 --> 26:30.778
He also told me
to expect a visit

26:30.780 --> 26:33.047
from you two,
but I can't sleep at night

26:33.049 --> 26:35.283
thinking he could do this
to another family.

26:39.189 --> 26:41.622
I hope it helps.

26:49.165 --> 26:52.400
That lying son of a bitch!

26:53.636 --> 26:56.404
I think it's time you
stepped off the investigation.

27:00.376 --> 27:02.743
Listen, if Joey thinks
you're on to him,

27:02.745 --> 27:04.478
there's a good chance
he's in the wind.

27:04.480 --> 27:05.947
And if he is,

27:05.949 --> 27:08.716
who do you think he's gonna pick
up the phone for, you or me?

27:08.718 --> 27:10.685
It doesn't matter.
Sure it does.

27:10.687 --> 27:12.453
I'm your best bet to find him,

27:12.455 --> 27:14.021
and you know it.

27:28.044 --> 27:30.077
This is really delicious.

27:30.079 --> 27:31.879
How do they make
a turducken, anyway?

27:31.941 --> 27:33.684
They feed a chicken to a duck,

27:33.784 --> 27:35.987
and then feed that duck
to a turkey.

27:36.198 --> 27:37.297
Really?

27:37.299 --> 27:38.699
That's so gross.

27:38.701 --> 27:40.334
Mom.

27:40.336 --> 27:42.803
They debone the birds and then
layer them smallest to largest.

27:42.805 --> 27:44.071
Well, however they make it,

27:44.073 --> 27:45.205
boy, it's good.

27:45.207 --> 27:46.507
So, Francis,

27:46.509 --> 27:49.042
did the Brits actually listen
to what you have to say,

27:49.044 --> 27:51.278
or were they just being British?

27:51.280 --> 27:53.547
One of them sure did--
kept pushing for more.

27:53.549 --> 27:55.315
More what?

27:55.317 --> 27:57.184
More of the secret sauce,
as the kids say.

27:57.186 --> 27:59.253
Kids don't say that, Grandpa.

27:59.255 --> 28:01.522
Oh, I thought they did.

28:01.524 --> 28:03.056
Some do.

28:03.058 --> 28:04.458
Yeah, I think
I've heard that.

28:04.460 --> 28:06.560
Thank you.
I think it's more

28:06.562 --> 28:08.529
of a marketing buzzword.
Well, anyway,

28:08.531 --> 28:11.298
she keeps wanting to know things
I can't tell her.

28:11.300 --> 28:12.266
Like?

28:12.268 --> 28:14.201
Like, things
I can't tell anybody.

28:14.203 --> 28:16.170
Things we do,
preparations we make

28:16.172 --> 28:18.772
that I can't risk
becoming known.

28:18.774 --> 28:19.940
Because they're illegal?

28:19.942 --> 28:21.008
No.

28:21.010 --> 28:22.543
Well, why else?

28:22.545 --> 28:23.544
Because if they become known,

28:23.546 --> 28:25.012
they would cease
to be effective.

28:25.014 --> 28:26.547
- Hmm.
- Well, I got kind of

28:26.549 --> 28:28.582
the opposite thing going on.
How's that?

28:28.584 --> 28:30.150
I've been asked
to mentor a newbie

28:30.152 --> 28:31.385
who doesn't give a damn

28:31.387 --> 28:32.486
about what I say.

28:32.488 --> 28:33.754
Uh-uh, language.

28:34.623 --> 28:36.356
Gosh darn about what I say.

28:36.358 --> 28:38.058
Maybe if you just
try talking to him

28:38.060 --> 28:39.693
instead of talking
down to him.

28:39.695 --> 28:41.829
I've tried talking up,
down, sideways.

28:41.831 --> 28:43.430
Is he talking about Marcus?
Yeah.

28:43.432 --> 28:44.731
You know,
“mentor” doesn't mean

28:44.733 --> 28:46.133
“be just like me”.

28:46.135 --> 28:48.535
It means, “let me find
your strengths,

28:48.537 --> 28:49.870
and help you grow them”"

28:49.872 --> 28:51.205
Well, Marcus' strengths
all seem to be

28:51.207 --> 28:53.407
in the chip on his shoulder.
Look deeper.

28:53.409 --> 28:54.808
Not everybody's cut out
to be a cop, Danny.

28:54.810 --> 28:56.143
And you don't get
to make

28:56.145 --> 28:57.444
that call, Jamie.

28:57.446 --> 28:58.779
In this instance, I do.
He's got no discipline,

28:58.781 --> 29:00.280
he's got no regard
for the rules,

29:00.282 --> 29:02.282
and he's an accident
waiting to happen.

29:02.284 --> 29:04.952
Says the guy who's still
in uniform because he's a...

29:04.954 --> 29:06.286
Because I choose to be!

29:06.288 --> 29:08.856
Let's keep it civil.

29:17.933 --> 29:21.034
For dessert, I made a Piecakey.

29:22.304 --> 29:23.837
A what?

29:23.839 --> 29:26.173
It's a cookie baked into a pie

29:26.175 --> 29:28.442
baked into a cake.

29:29.645 --> 29:31.979
I invented it.

29:37.720 --> 29:39.920
Tough crowd today, Pop.

29:47.897 --> 29:50.397
E-mails and voicemails
and texts.

29:50.399 --> 29:51.932
None of them returned.

29:51.934 --> 29:53.033
You call around?

29:53.035 --> 29:54.101
Of course.

29:54.103 --> 29:56.336
No one's seen him
since Friday night.

29:56.338 --> 29:58.005
Well, you did what you could.

29:58.007 --> 29:59.206
Yeah,

29:59.208 --> 30:01.241
but I haven't done
what I said I would,

30:01.243 --> 30:03.577
which was to draw him in.

30:03.579 --> 30:05.312
I've got enough to get
a warrant for his arrest.

30:05.314 --> 30:07.581
We'll just kick it over to the NYPD.
No.

30:07.583 --> 30:08.949
I want this.

30:08.951 --> 30:10.951
I should've seen this coming.

30:10.953 --> 30:13.687
We can all be blind
when it comes to family.

30:13.689 --> 30:15.989
You're right.

30:15.991 --> 30:17.824
There's one thing
I haven't tried.

30:17.826 --> 30:19.893
What?

30:19.895 --> 30:22.095
All Italian men
have one weakness.

30:22.097 --> 30:24.031
Yeah, wine, food?

30:24.033 --> 30:25.599
Well...

30:25.601 --> 30:28.001
one above all the rest.

30:35.611 --> 30:38.045
According to her office,
she is still in New York, sir.

30:38.047 --> 30:39.246
Oh, good.

30:39.248 --> 30:40.881
I got her mobile number.

30:40.883 --> 30:42.282
That's what they call it.

30:42.284 --> 30:44.017
Not “cell,” “mobile.”

30:44.019 --> 30:46.086
Right. Do me a favor.
Would that be a favor

30:46.088 --> 30:47.621
with a U?

30:48.590 --> 30:49.790
Sorry.

30:49.792 --> 30:51.792
Call and ask
and see if she's available

30:51.794 --> 30:53.627
for an 8:00 meeting tonight.

30:53.629 --> 30:54.361
You mean dinner?

30:55.764 --> 30:57.831
A meeting that could
include dinner, yes.

30:57.833 --> 30:59.766
A working dinner.

30:59.768 --> 31:01.835
Isn't that a call you'd want
to make yourself, sir?

31:01.837 --> 31:03.136
Do I ever schedule
my own meetings, Baker?

31:03.138 --> 31:04.137
No, sir.

31:04.139 --> 31:05.238
I just meant that if...

31:05.240 --> 31:06.540
I know what you meant.

31:06.542 --> 31:08.208
Please schedule the meeting.

31:08.210 --> 31:10.711
Should I ask her what kind
of cuisine she prefers?

31:10.713 --> 31:12.179
I don't know.

31:12.181 --> 31:13.780
Sure, okay.

31:16.051 --> 31:18.051
That'll be all, Baker.

31:18.053 --> 31:20.821
Yes, sir.

31:25.761 --> 31:28.962
I'm just saying, that's sort of
what you signed up for.

31:28.964 --> 31:30.464
Babysitting punks
like Marcus?

31:30.466 --> 31:32.966
Mentoring rookies,
like me,

31:32.968 --> 31:35.035
and yeah,
some like Marcus.

31:35.037 --> 31:37.337
Most rookies have a sense
of respect for the job.

31:37.339 --> 31:38.905
You did.
Well...

31:38.907 --> 31:41.541
maybe Marcus does, too,
in his own way.

31:41.543 --> 31:43.744
He thinks he knows
more than he does.

31:43.746 --> 31:45.679
It's all an act.

31:45.681 --> 31:48.115
I don't think so.

31:48.117 --> 31:49.916
The kid lost his father
really young.

31:49.918 --> 31:52.319
That can change a person.

31:52.321 --> 31:55.489
Maybe I don't have
my dad's patience after all.

31:57.726 --> 31:59.292
Trust me, you do.

31:59.294 --> 32:02.095
All units confines
of the 12th precinct,

32:02.097 --> 32:03.096
be advised.

32:03.098 --> 32:04.965
We have a 10-30 Borough Bank,

32:04.967 --> 32:06.266
Union and Grand Streets.

32:06.268 --> 32:08.168
Two suspects, armed.

32:10.873 --> 32:12.372
There's got to be
another way.

32:12.374 --> 32:14.374
Not as fast
and as sure as this.

32:14.376 --> 32:16.910
Joey's very close to his mom.

32:19.314 --> 32:20.781
Anthony!

32:22.351 --> 32:23.750
Look at you!

32:23.752 --> 32:25.585
Aunt Sophia,
beautiful as always.

32:26.588 --> 32:27.387
Come in, come in.

32:27.389 --> 32:28.455
It's so cold!

32:28.457 --> 32:30.190
Anthony's aunt Sophia.

32:30.192 --> 32:31.858
Hi, Erin Reagan.

32:31.860 --> 32:32.959
Nice to meet you.

32:32.961 --> 32:34.795
Let's get you something
to eat. Come on.

32:49.511 --> 32:50.677
What do we got?

32:50.679 --> 32:52.746
Two armed perps inside
with weapons on the clerk.

32:52.748 --> 32:53.747
We gotta move in.

32:53.749 --> 32:56.149
No, we gotta wait for ESU
to get here.

32:56.151 --> 32:57.084
Hey, Eddie, request HNT.

32:57.086 --> 32:58.452
Central,
12-David...

32:58.454 --> 33:00.287
The perps look real jumpy;
I don't think we should wait.

33:00.289 --> 33:02.289
There's four of us, let's take 'em.
No.

33:02.291 --> 33:04.591
Steve, you and Marcus
cover the front.

33:04.593 --> 33:05.792
Eddie and I'll work our way
around the back,

33:05.794 --> 33:07.027
see if we can get in there
and talk 'em down.

33:07.029 --> 33:08.195
Want to make sure
we don't scare 'em

33:08.197 --> 33:09.529
into doing something
even dumber.

33:09.531 --> 33:11.398
Hey, Eddie.

33:11.400 --> 33:12.799
Come on.

33:12.801 --> 33:15.235
Everyone stay down!

33:15.237 --> 33:17.471
Come on, come on,
just shove that money through!

33:18.273 --> 33:19.940
Hurry up! I said, hurry up!

33:21.009 --> 33:23.243
Come on, bitch,
just throw the cash!

33:24.446 --> 33:26.146
Don't make me
shoot her!

33:26.148 --> 33:28.181
Let's go, let's go, faster!

33:28.183 --> 33:29.282
Police! Don't move!

33:29.284 --> 33:30.450
Drop your weapons!

33:30.452 --> 33:31.718
Nobody has to get hurt!

33:31.720 --> 33:33.487
Just get down on the ground.

33:33.489 --> 33:35.222
Okay!
What are you doing, man?

33:35.224 --> 33:36.623
Just put the gun down, man.

33:36.625 --> 33:38.692
Calm down.
Listen to your partner.

33:38.694 --> 33:39.926
Come on, let the lady go.

33:39.928 --> 33:41.161
Don't be stupid.
All right, all right.

33:41.163 --> 33:43.130
Put your gun down.
All right, all right.

33:43.132 --> 33:44.097
Easy does it. That's it.
Put down the gun.

33:44.099 --> 33:45.899
Stop, police!

33:55.777 --> 33:57.010
Are you okay?

33:57.012 --> 33:58.111
Yeah.

33:58.113 --> 33:59.546
Okay.

33:59.548 --> 34:01.414
Show me your hands.
Give me your hands!

34:01.416 --> 34:02.682
Eddie, call it in.

34:02.684 --> 34:04.651
We need a bus forthwith

34:04.653 --> 34:06.253
on the corner
of Houston and Jones.

34:16.174 --> 34:17.473
I take it back.
That kid's a menace.

34:17.475 --> 34:18.708
Take it easy.

34:18.710 --> 34:20.076
You told him
to wait outside!

34:20.078 --> 34:22.143
Yeah, trust me, I know.
He could've got us killed.

34:22.146 --> 34:23.579
Oh, there he is.

34:23.581 --> 34:24.958
You know, I'm gonna give him
a piece of my mind.

34:24.960 --> 34:26.683
Hey, hey.
Eddie, wait. Listen.

34:26.684 --> 34:28.317
I don't think yelling at him

34:28.319 --> 34:29.918
is gonna do anyone any good.

34:29.920 --> 34:31.087
Well, it might do me some good!

34:31.089 --> 34:32.255
Just let me take this one.

34:40.465 --> 34:42.498
You holding up?

34:43.868 --> 34:45.835
Came here to say
“I told you so”?

34:45.837 --> 34:48.070
I don't really care,
to be honest.

34:53.411 --> 34:56.279
They almost
killed me, man.

34:56.281 --> 34:58.714
They almost
killed all of us.

34:58.716 --> 35:01.384
And no one had
to get shot today.

35:01.386 --> 35:03.753
Ah...

35:03.755 --> 35:05.154
I don't know what to do.

35:05.156 --> 35:06.155
You're in shock.

35:06.157 --> 35:07.557
I've been there.
You'll be okay.

35:09.127 --> 35:10.126
What's on the paper?

35:10.128 --> 35:12.361
My letter of resignation.

35:12.363 --> 35:14.864
That may be
the first smart thing

35:14.866 --> 35:16.532
you've done since you got here.

35:41.926 --> 35:43.693
Ma?

35:43.695 --> 35:46.228
Ma, are you okay?!

35:46.230 --> 35:47.830
Ma, where are you?

35:49.067 --> 35:50.466
She stepped out, Joey.

35:50.468 --> 35:52.401
She called me. She told me
she fell and couldn't get up!

35:52.403 --> 35:53.703
What the hell's
going on, Anthony?

35:53.705 --> 35:54.937
She's fine.

35:54.939 --> 35:56.372
Oh, thank God.

35:56.374 --> 35:58.574
What is she doing here?

36:00.612 --> 36:01.944
No.

36:01.946 --> 36:04.614
No, no, no, no!

36:11.322 --> 36:12.888
You son of a bitch.

36:12.890 --> 36:14.457
You should've returned my call.
You did this?

36:14.459 --> 36:17.360
You set me up and used
my mother, your aunt, as bait?

36:17.362 --> 36:19.528
After you used me to scam cops?

36:19.530 --> 36:20.963
You bet your skinny ass I did!

36:20.965 --> 36:22.932
You got nothing.
Story of your life.

36:22.934 --> 36:24.467
We got plenty, Joey.

36:24.469 --> 36:27.069
And what we don't have,
you're gonna give to us.

36:27.071 --> 36:28.704
I ain't saying nothing
without a lawyer.

36:28.706 --> 36:29.939
I already called Uncle Sal.

36:29.941 --> 36:32.908
His guy's meeting us
down at the DA's office.

36:32.910 --> 36:35.044
Wow, thank you.
What a guy, Anthony.

36:35.046 --> 36:36.412
Hey, you're family.

36:36.414 --> 36:38.314
It's the least I could do.

36:38.316 --> 36:39.715
You got the right
to remain silent.

36:39.717 --> 36:41.550
Anything you do or say
may be used against you

36:41.552 --> 36:42.852
in a court of law.

36:42.854 --> 36:43.986
Hey! Too tight!

36:43.988 --> 36:45.521
Hey, they're new.

36:45.523 --> 36:48.491
They'll stretch
when you break 'em in.

36:56.734 --> 36:58.801
So... now you go.

36:58.803 --> 37:01.003
No, I can't top yours.

37:01.973 --> 37:04.006
And someone
might overhear.

37:04.008 --> 37:06.375
I can't get my voice
down as low as you can.

37:06.377 --> 37:08.244
You promised me a secret.

37:08.246 --> 37:09.912
Fair's fair.
Dessert and coffee?

37:09.914 --> 37:12.281
Uh, no,
not for me, thanks.

37:12.283 --> 37:13.449
Commissioner?

37:13.451 --> 37:15.618
No, we'll just finish our wine.

37:16.888 --> 37:18.087
Thank you.

37:21.125 --> 37:23.059
Okay.

37:23.061 --> 37:25.594
Confidential informants, uh,

37:25.596 --> 37:27.363
in radical mosques

37:27.365 --> 37:30.833
have worse odds of paying off
than a Tijuana slot machine.

37:30.835 --> 37:32.735
Really?
Well, you get a huge percentage

37:32.737 --> 37:35.271
of them going double agent,

37:35.273 --> 37:37.573
you waste thousands of man-hours

37:37.575 --> 37:40.776
and put lives in danger
in the bargain.

37:40.778 --> 37:41.911
But everybody uses them.

37:41.913 --> 37:43.846
You don't?

37:43.848 --> 37:45.381
As little as possible.

37:45.383 --> 37:47.349
And you don't.

37:47.351 --> 37:49.251
You don't have mosques
in the Financial District.

37:49.253 --> 37:50.786
No, but Thornton and Kellen

37:50.788 --> 37:52.922
certainly have informants
in mosques.

37:52.924 --> 37:55.224
You didn't share
these doubts with them.

37:55.226 --> 37:56.459
No, I didn't.

37:56.461 --> 37:57.827
You were holding back.

37:57.829 --> 37:59.295
No.

37:59.297 --> 38:03.399
I couldn't warn them off of
something that I can't prove.

38:03.401 --> 38:06.368
I couldn't convince them that
a disaffected young Muslim

38:06.370 --> 38:09.071
set up with a charismatic imam

38:09.073 --> 38:11.440
might not make for

38:11.442 --> 38:13.375
a reliable narrator.

38:13.377 --> 38:16.912
And if I did, and they
acted on my warnings,

38:16.914 --> 38:20.149
I might have compromised
a valuable operation.

38:20.151 --> 38:21.550
The known unknown.

38:21.552 --> 38:25.454
The damned if you do,
or damned if you don't thing.

38:26.524 --> 38:27.656
I'm so sorry.

38:27.658 --> 38:29.191
That wasn't editorial.

38:29.193 --> 38:31.327
I'm still on UK time,
and it's got to be, what?

38:31.329 --> 38:32.294
4:00 in the morning?

38:32.296 --> 38:34.063
No offense taken.
No, I...

38:34.065 --> 38:36.766
It's the truth.
I-I mean it. Really, Frank.

38:36.768 --> 38:38.200
I'll drop you at your hotel.

38:38.202 --> 38:40.369
Where we might have a nightcap.

38:42.206 --> 38:44.440
Uh, the hotel doesn't
actually have a bar,

38:44.442 --> 38:47.643
but my room has a mini-bar.

38:47.645 --> 38:49.578
Oh.

38:52.316 --> 38:54.517
Oh...

38:56.020 --> 38:58.587
And there I go again, um,

38:58.589 --> 39:00.389
overstepping boundaries.

39:00.391 --> 39:03.592
I think I'm just
going to powder my nose.

39:14.806 --> 39:16.338
You might be getting
better at the range,

39:16.340 --> 39:18.073
but I own you here.

39:18.075 --> 39:19.742
Pride goeth before the fall.

39:19.744 --> 39:20.943
Okay, Dad.

39:23.815 --> 39:25.014
Come on,
double or nothing.

39:25.016 --> 39:25.981
Drinks first.

39:25.983 --> 39:27.449
You're buying.

39:27.451 --> 39:29.952
Hey!

39:29.954 --> 39:32.321
I heard you did have
a close one today, though.

39:32.323 --> 39:33.789
Didn't have to be.

39:33.791 --> 39:35.324
I know.

39:35.326 --> 39:37.726
You were right
about Marcus.

39:37.728 --> 39:40.729
He's always been
a pain in the ass.

39:40.731 --> 39:42.198
Oh, really?

39:42.200 --> 39:43.332
Yeah.

39:43.334 --> 39:45.634
But don't give up on him.

39:45.636 --> 39:46.836
I don't think
it matters now.

39:46.838 --> 39:48.037
He turned in his letter
of resignation.

39:48.039 --> 39:50.306
I heard about that.
I spoke to his C.O. already.

39:50.308 --> 39:53.576
I'm asking him to wait a few
days before doing anything.

39:53.578 --> 39:55.611
Danny, why are you
trying to protect him?

39:55.613 --> 39:57.012
Because.

39:57.014 --> 39:58.280
The kid's had a tough life,

39:58.282 --> 40:00.349
and he's trying
to make it better.

40:00.351 --> 40:02.852
I owe his old man,
so I want to help.

40:02.854 --> 40:04.587
So you're just going
to keep transferring him

40:04.589 --> 40:06.622
from precinct
to precinct forever?

40:06.624 --> 40:08.290
You know, for somebody
as smart as you,

40:08.292 --> 40:10.759
you sure are thick as a brick
sometimes.

40:12.196 --> 40:14.697
I wanted him transferred
to your precinct

40:14.699 --> 40:15.931
right out of the Academy

40:15.933 --> 40:18.601
so he could be close to you.
Why?

40:18.603 --> 40:19.969
Because you're the best mentor

40:19.971 --> 40:21.937
I could think of.

40:21.939 --> 40:24.106
And you're the best cop I know.

40:26.510 --> 40:28.777
That's why.

40:30.915 --> 40:33.616
And honestly, you could
teach him things that I can't.

40:35.820 --> 40:38.554
Let's talk to the kid,
all right?

40:38.556 --> 40:40.589
Me and you. Together.

40:40.591 --> 40:42.424
But mostly you.

40:44.896 --> 40:47.096
What do you say?

40:47.098 --> 40:50.099
Okay.

40:53.638 --> 40:55.771
Thank you.

40:55.773 --> 40:56.972
Good night.

40:58.943 --> 41:00.409
Shall we?

41:00.411 --> 41:01.710
Shall we what?

41:01.712 --> 41:03.178
Do what you said.

41:03.180 --> 41:04.980
Have a nightcap.

41:04.982 --> 41:07.016
The Irish in you
okay with that?

41:07.018 --> 41:09.184
Very okay with that.
