00:24.558 --> 00:26.859
<i> [vernon] we got a blizzard</i>
<i>  blowing this morning.</i>

00:26.861 --> 00:30.396
It's just another hurdle.
I mean, it's one thing
after another.

00:31.532 --> 00:32.765
<i> [narrator] one storm</i>
<i>  is passing.</i>

00:32.767 --> 00:35.868
<i>  But another one,</i>
<i>  is set to roll in,</i>

00:35.870 --> 00:40.072
<i>  as captain vernon adkinson</i>
<i>  starts his ice-mining season.</i>

00:40.941 --> 00:42.941
Just about ready
to get out on the ice.

00:42.943 --> 00:45.110
I'm going down here
to take a look

00:45.780 --> 00:48.781
and see
what the ice looks like,

00:48.783 --> 00:51.216
to make sure
that we'll be able to pull
our gear out there.

00:52.887 --> 00:54.787
<i>  We chose to start the season</i>
<i>  a couple of days late</i>

00:54.789 --> 00:57.423
<i>  because of the big storm</i>
<i>  that passed through.</i>

00:57.425 --> 00:59.658
Now there's already
another one setting to strike.

00:59.660 --> 01:03.796
The whole damn winter
probably going to be this way.

01:03.798 --> 01:06.565
<i>  But we can't wait any longer.</i>
<i>  I got big plans</i>
<i>  for this season,</i>

01:06.567 --> 01:08.801
so we need to get a move on.

01:08.803 --> 01:10.769
<i> [narrator] this summer,</i>
<i>  vernon's big gamble,</i>

01:10.771 --> 01:13.772
<i>  buying claim 56 paid off big.</i>

01:13.774 --> 01:14.673
[man] I'm seeing gold, ver.

01:14.675 --> 01:18.410
That's the stuff of dreams,
my friend.

01:18.412 --> 01:22.548
<i> [narrator] now, this winter,</i>
<i>  as he heads back</i>
<i>  to his cash cow,</i>

01:22.550 --> 01:25.984
<i>  he's aiming for</i>
<i>  the biggest season haul</i>
<i>  of his career.</i>

01:25.986 --> 01:28.887
We're basically
using the same rig
as we use last

01:28.889 --> 01:31.990
winter, except we've made
lot of improvements.

01:33.761 --> 01:36.428
Every single beat
we've set for an eight inch

01:36.430 --> 01:40.399
versus what we were using
last winter was a six inch.

01:40.401 --> 01:42.868
We've put twice
the material through the box.

01:42.870 --> 01:46.472
I'm thinking based on the fact
that our gear
is so much better,

01:46.474 --> 01:49.875
plus the fact that we know
where the gold is,

01:49.877 --> 01:53.245
there's a possibility
that we could get up to
200 ounces.

01:58.018 --> 02:02.387
The spot we were working
the end of the summer
is about a half a mile

02:03.457 --> 02:05.691
out on the ice, to the south.

02:05.693 --> 02:09.361
And it's a spot
we were marked as
super gold on our chart.

02:09.363 --> 02:13.031
We got some
really good gold there.

02:13.033 --> 02:16.435
We have the coordinates
where we found absolutely
killer gold.

02:19.240 --> 02:20.272
We're ready to go.

02:20.274 --> 02:23.175
We got to pull
these two units out first.

02:30.684 --> 02:34.786
<i>  In winter,</i>
<i>  you can't go willy-nilly</i>
<i>  and mine anywhere.</i>

02:34.788 --> 02:37.890
You got to find
a spot that's got
the right ice conditions

02:37.892 --> 02:39.791
and has gold underneath.

02:39.793 --> 02:42.494
<i>  Right now,</i>
<i>  we're behind the curve.</i>

02:42.496 --> 02:45.664
<i>  Starting late</i>
<i> with another storm on the way.</i>

02:45.666 --> 02:47.933
<i>  There's no room for error.</i>
<i>  We got to get on it.</i>

02:47.935 --> 02:49.301
We got to get on it, quick.

02:55.943 --> 02:57.242
This is damn near perfect.

02:59.046 --> 03:04.183
A wide, wide expanse
of flat ice.

03:05.419 --> 03:07.986
Right there, underneath that.

03:08.622 --> 03:09.955
It's super gold.

03:12.993 --> 03:15.460
Okay, let's drop that camera.

03:15.462 --> 03:17.429
See if we can
see any gold down there.

03:22.770 --> 03:25.971
All right,
we're coming into sight.
Come up a little bit.

03:27.041 --> 03:29.374
Back and forth. No, not down.

03:30.110 --> 03:32.177
Little bit more down.

03:33.847 --> 03:35.013
All right, hold it.

03:35.015 --> 03:36.415
Take a look at this, gary.

03:37.885 --> 03:39.051
What does that look like?

03:41.155 --> 03:42.621
Cobble, there it is.

03:42.623 --> 03:45.724
-[man] now, that looks good.
-[man 2] it does, doesn't it?

03:45.726 --> 03:48.060
-[man] look at how
the rocks are laying.
-[man 2] yeah.

03:48.062 --> 03:49.394
We're right on top of it.

03:49.396 --> 03:50.395
Looks good, man.

03:51.532 --> 03:54.766
This is the sweet spot.
Smooth ice. Good cobble.

03:54.768 --> 03:59.004
And, right where we hit some
major gold, last summer.

04:01.875 --> 04:03.875
<i>  Even the thickness</i>
<i>  of the ice is perfect.</i>

04:03.877 --> 04:05.744
<i>  About three and a half feet.</i>

04:05.746 --> 04:07.346
I couldn't ask
for anything better.

04:08.983 --> 04:14.219
In addition to
improving our setup,
my ice team is second to none.

04:15.889 --> 04:19.758
My top guy from last summer,
gary is suiting up again.

04:19.760 --> 04:22.127
I'll going into that hole,
working the bottom.

04:22.129 --> 04:23.495
That's where I prefer to be.

04:23.497 --> 04:26.665
And then the ace up my sleeve,
gary panos also is back.

04:26.667 --> 04:29.401
<i>  He's been the rock star</i>
<i>  of the operation for years.</i>

04:29.403 --> 04:30.636
[gary] getting diver down.

04:30.638 --> 04:32.671
I'm going to make
some money today.

04:32.673 --> 04:34.339
Well, that's the game plan,
you know?

04:35.776 --> 04:38.877
As long as we can
stay ahead of mother nature,

04:38.879 --> 04:41.113
everything ought to be
coming up vernon.

04:47.855 --> 04:50.389
All right, water is flowing.

04:53.761 --> 04:55.427
<i> [vernon] I've got to put</i>
<i>  going down first.</i>

04:55.429 --> 04:57.496
Ice mining
is dangerous as hell.

04:57.498 --> 04:59.031
<i>  So much can go wrong.</i>

04:59.033 --> 05:03.402
<i>  So, I want my best man,</i>
<i>  my strongest man,</i>
<i>  gary panos on top</i>

05:03.404 --> 05:05.270
keeping an eye
on the operation.

05:21.955 --> 05:23.889
[diver] first dive
of the season, boys.

05:23.891 --> 05:26.058
I'm glad to be back down here.

05:29.029 --> 05:30.429
[gary] how's it
going down there?

05:30.798 --> 05:32.264
[diver] yeah, good, good.

05:33.400 --> 05:35.934
I just want
to look around a little bit.

05:42.609 --> 05:46.345
Hey, gary, does it look like
that ground has been
mined already?

05:46.714 --> 05:49.414
[diver]
oh, definitely not. No.

05:49.416 --> 05:52.851
[vernon] okay, does it
remind you of
where we were last summer?

05:52.853 --> 05:56.221
You think it's
the same type of material?

05:56.223 --> 05:58.857
[diver] it looks like
the same type of material.

05:58.859 --> 06:02.961
When we were on super gold,
right now, I'm just trying
to get down to the clay.

06:02.963 --> 06:04.763
Clay layer,
then we go from there.

06:04.765 --> 06:05.764
[vernon] yeah, okay.

06:10.104 --> 06:12.270
[diver] boy, this stuff looks
good down here.

06:19.713 --> 06:21.113
Yeah, there's gold.

06:22.816 --> 06:23.982
<i> [vernon] I see it, I see it.</i>

06:23.984 --> 06:26.051
Yeah, yeah, that's nice.

06:26.553 --> 06:29.788
[diver] there's more gold.
Hey, baby.

06:29.790 --> 06:33.058
<i> [vernon] I want to get into</i>
<i>  what we were seeing last year</i>

06:33.060 --> 06:35.060
when it was just flowing
into the nozzle.

06:35.062 --> 06:37.863
<i> [diver] I can see gold</i>
<i>  into the nozzle,</i>
<i> so that is a good sign, right?</i>

06:37.865 --> 06:38.830
<i> [vernon] it is.</i>

06:40.667 --> 06:43.735
[diver] feels great man.
Warm down here, perfect.

06:43.737 --> 06:45.570
I mean everything is good.

06:45.572 --> 06:47.506
<i> [vernon] all right, all right.</i>

06:47.508 --> 06:49.408
This is the way
to start the season.

06:49.410 --> 06:51.476
<i>  We're going to</i>
<i>  stay on this spot</i>
<i>  as long as we can.</i>

06:51.478 --> 06:55.747
<i>  And get as much gold</i>
<i>  we possibly can,</i>
<i>  before the next storm hits.</i>

06:55.749 --> 06:58.817
Mother nature is going to
have to drag us away,
kicking and screaming.

06:58.819 --> 07:00.986
[diver] couple little pieces,
right there.

07:00.988 --> 07:03.388
[vernon] all right.
That's what
I want to hear gary.

07:03.991 --> 07:07.826
So, fingers crossed,
knocking on wood,

07:07.828 --> 07:09.361
we'll make a good a payday.

07:15.402 --> 07:17.035
<i> [narrator] seven-miles west...</i>

07:22.810 --> 07:24.476
[shawn] it is cold.

07:24.478 --> 07:27.345
Whoo, it is 20 below...

07:29.817 --> 07:31.316
<i> [narrator] despite</i>
<i>  the arctic conditions...</i>

07:31.952 --> 07:33.985
Storm just blew through.

07:34.054 --> 07:36.188
We're back on our way out.

07:37.991 --> 07:42.394
<i> [narrator] shawn pomrenke</i>
<i>  is back on his quest,</i>
<i>  to find a pot of gold</i>

07:42.396 --> 07:44.296
<i>  on an ancient river bed.</i>

07:45.899 --> 07:49.868
At 20 below just
keeping things running is...

07:49.903 --> 07:51.603
It's a struggle.

07:51.605 --> 07:54.973
Hopefully, the generator
fires right up.

07:54.975 --> 07:57.576
Then we ought to get
water flowing.

07:57.578 --> 08:00.178
Pump running.
Air compressor running.

08:01.515 --> 08:03.815
I'm looking for something
almost mythical.

08:03.817 --> 08:08.386
<i>  I'm looking for that jackpot</i>
<i>  on that ancient riverbed</i>
<i>  on the tomcod.</i>

08:08.388 --> 08:11.690
<i>  There's hints of it,</i>
<i>  from the material I'm seeing.</i>

08:11.692 --> 08:15.160
<i>  Now, that it's winter,</i>
<i>  I can actually get down</i>
<i>  on the bottom</i>

08:15.162 --> 08:17.896
<i>  and put my eyes on the gold</i>
<i>  and follow it.</i>

08:17.898 --> 08:21.199
I'm going to find
that motherlode,
whether it's 20 below or not.

08:23.871 --> 08:25.537
<i>  Today, we're going to</i>
<i>  get some gold.</i>

08:25.539 --> 08:28.874
<i>  I've a good</i>
<i>  feeling about this haul.</i>

08:28.876 --> 08:31.977
The harder it is to get,
the better the gold
is going to be.

08:31.979 --> 08:35.146
<i>  I can feel it in my bones.</i>

08:40.187 --> 08:44.256
Need a 120 ounces
to make my payments
this season.

08:44.258 --> 08:48.760
<i>  I have the tomcod payment.</i>
<i>  The upgrades to the myrtle.</i>
<i>  And the inland mine.</i>

08:48.762 --> 08:50.495
Just as soon as
we got started ice-mining,

08:50.497 --> 08:54.332
we got hit with the worst
blizzard I've ever seen.

08:54.334 --> 08:58.503
<i>  We got absolutely dumped on.</i>
<i>  And it's supposed to be</i>
<i>  like this all winter.</i>

08:58.505 --> 09:02.974
They're predicting
this to be the worst winter
of 100 years.

09:02.976 --> 09:05.243
But that doesn't stop
the bills from coming.

09:10.417 --> 09:11.683
Everything came out.

09:11.685 --> 09:12.984
Worked out perfect.

09:12.986 --> 09:17.656
Nothing in the snow grips,
anymore, till the next storm.

09:17.658 --> 09:21.126
Last time on,
I cleaned up this hole.

09:21.128 --> 09:24.963
<i>  So, we're going to go ahead,</i>
<i>  cut a new whole</i>
<i>  and follow this pastry.</i>

09:25.232 --> 09:27.332
<i>  Hopefully, that's where</i>
<i>  the jackpot is.</i>

09:38.845 --> 09:42.047
I'm going to get
changed outside, 20 below.

09:44.952 --> 09:46.284
[bleep]

10:04.605 --> 10:06.538
hot water is working great.

10:06.540 --> 10:10.275
Get the air compressor
fired up,
then we're in business.

10:14.047 --> 10:17.115
I'm going to go down lose,
some of my covid weight.

10:17.718 --> 10:19.250
[laughs]

10:35.002 --> 10:37.002
all righty, how's it feeling?

10:38.972 --> 10:40.171
Air is good, water is good?

10:40.607 --> 10:41.706
Booyah.

10:55.355 --> 10:58.056
[shawn] you know, it's good
to be back under the ice.

10:58.959 --> 11:02.260
Yeah, this cold is just
another ten variables.

11:11.738 --> 11:13.905
[man] how you doing
down there shawn?

11:13.907 --> 11:17.242
[shawn] doing good.
Just making my way down
to the bottom.

11:18.045 --> 11:19.978
Pretty dark down here.

11:21.048 --> 11:23.214
<i>  I'm at the nozzle now.</i>

11:48.709 --> 11:50.141
He's liking what he's seeing.

11:51.011 --> 11:52.277
He likes it, I'm happy.

11:52.846 --> 11:54.412
[shawn]

11:54.414 --> 11:56.181
[laughs]

12:02.656 --> 12:07.392
there's a lot of magnetite,
lot of iron, iron is the horse
the gold rode in on.

12:07.394 --> 12:10.161
So, we found the horse,
now we just
need to find the rider.

12:13.467 --> 12:15.333
[shawn speaking]

12:19.973 --> 12:22.140
sounds like he's seeing
a little gold down there.

12:25.445 --> 12:28.079
[shawn speaking]

12:46.666 --> 12:48.833
<i> [narrator] one blizzard</i>
<i>  may have passed.</i>

12:48.835 --> 12:51.836
<i>  But just 30 miles</i>
<i>  outside of town,</i>

12:51.838 --> 12:54.205
<i>  another one</i>
<i> is quickly gathering strength.</i>

13:09.723 --> 13:13.057
Chris, I'm going
to follow you.
Your trail is what I need.

13:13.059 --> 13:14.692
<i> [narrator] as more</i>
<i>  harsh weather looms.</i>

13:14.694 --> 13:17.929
<i>  Kris kelly, is racing</i>
<i>  to finally get on the ice.</i>

13:17.931 --> 13:20.398
We really try to
do this professional.

13:20.400 --> 13:22.433
You know, proper,
commercial grade.

13:22.435 --> 13:24.702
Now we have to do,
what we have to do.

13:24.704 --> 13:27.238
This is what
we're good at though.
Making it get done.

13:28.942 --> 13:31.409
Plan is,
chris is going to pull
my sleuth box down.

13:31.411 --> 13:33.144
I'm going to pull my sled.

13:33.146 --> 13:36.815
I have made
this speed before but
not with this snow machine.

13:36.817 --> 13:38.383
I hope it works out.

13:38.819 --> 13:41.753
This summer was a disaster.

13:41.755 --> 13:43.855
<i>  So, I'm placing this winter</i>
<i>  to make up for it.</i>

13:43.857 --> 13:47.592
<i>  I went into huge debt buying</i>
<i>  a top-of-the-line operation.</i>

13:47.594 --> 13:49.928
I have no time to wait around.

13:49.930 --> 13:50.895
You know,
I'm freezing right now.

13:50.897 --> 13:52.597
I gotta put my damn
snow pants on, cold.

13:52.599 --> 13:54.899
Oh, it's really cold.

13:54.901 --> 13:57.135
-[chris] get it done.
-Okay buddy, come on.
Let's rock and roll.

14:12.152 --> 14:14.285
Yeah, baby. Yeah.

14:17.057 --> 14:18.423
Oh, [bleep].

14:20.227 --> 14:22.093
[screams]

14:22.095 --> 14:23.328
[bleep]

14:24.264 --> 14:26.064
[screams]

14:33.406 --> 14:35.039
[scream]

14:40.947 --> 14:43.815
<i> [kris] this snow machine</i>
<i>  I have, has no business</i>

14:43.817 --> 14:45.450
<i>  towing anything</i>
<i>  out on the ice.</i>

14:45.452 --> 14:48.419
But, I'm a little desperate.

14:48.421 --> 14:51.556
<i>  I'll try anything right now</i>
<i>  cause I'm feeling</i>
<i>  the pressure.</i>

14:51.558 --> 14:54.292
I owe $15,000 and I'm not
even on the ice yet.

14:55.762 --> 14:58.029
Everything is going
to [bleep] today.

15:03.670 --> 15:04.602
<i> [narrator] two-miles west...</i>

15:14.180 --> 15:17.115
The snow looks like
it's setting up nicely,

15:17.117 --> 15:20.051
<i> [narrator] the brothers</i>
<i>  tenhoff are hoping to stay,</i>
<i>  one step ahead</i>

15:20.053 --> 15:21.619
<i>  of mother nature.</i>

15:21.621 --> 15:27.025
The blizzard started.
We were unable to actually
pull anything to shore at all.

15:27.027 --> 15:30.962
We should go dig out a hole
and dig out all that stuff
and open the hole back up.

15:30.964 --> 15:32.096
Let's good to dig them out.

15:32.799 --> 15:33.431
Stormy.

15:33.667 --> 15:36.434
[stormy barking]

15:36.436 --> 15:38.336
<i> [zeke] this last storm</i>
<i>  really worked us over.</i>

15:38.338 --> 15:41.806
We were off to a good start,
but we had to bail
because of the blizzard.

15:41.808 --> 15:44.609
<i>  Now, we have to dig</i>
<i>  a whole operation</i>
<i>  out of the snow.</i>

15:44.611 --> 15:45.944
<i>  And we got to do it fast</i>

15:45.946 --> 15:48.413
<i>  because there is</i>
<i>  another storm right</i>
<i>  around the corner.</i>

15:48.415 --> 15:50.848
This winter is
going to be brutal.
I can tell.

15:50.850 --> 15:52.250
And I need to be
up to the challenge.

16:03.063 --> 16:04.228
[zeke] well,

16:05.098 --> 16:06.931
dive pool's there.

16:06.933 --> 16:10.034
This is
one night's worth of snow.

16:10.036 --> 16:11.636
[gabe] well,
nothing blew away.

16:11.638 --> 16:13.071
That's a good sign.

16:13.073 --> 16:14.906
We have to move
this entire snow drift.

16:14.908 --> 16:17.642
-[zeke] earning
my money today.
-Yeah.

16:17.644 --> 16:19.110
[zeke] gotta get after it,
you know.

16:19.112 --> 16:20.678
[gabe] I'll start on
this side, I guess.

16:20.680 --> 16:22.013
Okay.

16:24.384 --> 16:26.284
Glad the ice didn't go out.

16:26.286 --> 16:29.687
Because we didn't
lose any gear.
It's all still here.

16:29.689 --> 16:32.056
If I get everything
running today, I'm going to go
under water and...

16:32.058 --> 16:36.995
I just want to go
and smash out
a bunch of more hours.

16:36.997 --> 16:39.063
Move as much ground as I can

16:39.065 --> 16:40.365
before we move.

16:40.367 --> 16:42.233
Dig stormy, dig.

16:46.873 --> 16:50.541
Last summer, I spent
the whole season building
a sailboat, right?

16:50.543 --> 16:52.577
It was cool but I didn't get
a whole lot of gold.

16:52.579 --> 16:55.613
<i>  This winter isn't going</i>
<i>  a whole lot better.</i>

16:55.615 --> 16:58.850
<i>  Realistically, I need</i>
<i>  at least eight ounces</i>
<i>  out of this winter,</i>

16:58.852 --> 17:01.986
just to keep my summer time
operation going forward.

17:03.757 --> 17:06.124
I'm beginning to wonder
if getting back into

17:06.126 --> 17:07.925
ice-dredging was
the right call.

17:07.927 --> 17:11.095
That's the question
that I've got to answer
this season.

17:11.631 --> 17:13.831
I think, we still got
to clear more snow.

17:13.833 --> 17:15.299
[gabe] sometimes,
that's what you got to do.

17:21.875 --> 17:23.408
Pizza delivery.

17:23.410 --> 17:25.843
-[stormy howling happily]
-[steve] hey.

17:25.845 --> 17:27.011
[zeke] hi, steve,
how's it going?

17:27.013 --> 17:28.446
I'm hungry too.

17:29.849 --> 17:31.816
[zeke] here you go, man.
Thanks for the pizza.

17:31.818 --> 17:33.351
Yeah man, oranges too.

17:35.021 --> 17:35.653
Oh, baby.

17:35.655 --> 17:37.422
Oh, my god, shrimp.

17:38.992 --> 17:40.324
You know, I was thinking
of you guys out here,

17:40.326 --> 17:43.394
and I'm thinking,
"maybe they don't have food."

17:43.396 --> 17:47.799
and they're burning energy
because the big snow storm
left a ton of snow everywhere.

17:47.801 --> 17:50.435
So, I came out with pizza.

17:50.437 --> 17:53.171
-[zeke] this is so good.
-Yes. This is amazing.

17:54.040 --> 17:58.009
The deal with zeke is,
I get a slice of
every gold he gets.

17:58.044 --> 17:59.777
I don't know how to put this.

17:59.779 --> 18:01.679
So far he's got diddly squat.

18:01.681 --> 18:03.181
But I'm a team player.

18:03.183 --> 18:04.882
I have faith
that this will way off,

18:04.884 --> 18:06.350
eventually.

18:07.987 --> 18:11.022
The price of pizza in nome,
was not cheap.

18:11.091 --> 18:12.623
I got a receipt here.

18:12.625 --> 18:13.791
[gabe] we'll pay you back.

18:13.793 --> 18:17.628
Oh no no,
this is part of being
on the crew here.

18:17.630 --> 18:20.565
[steve] a large pizza
in nome is $38.

18:20.567 --> 18:23.401
Plus tip.
I counted up the slices.

18:23.403 --> 18:25.803
I paid five bucks a slice
for this pizza.

18:25.805 --> 18:28.172
If I can clean up some gold,
then we'll have money.

18:28.475 --> 18:29.574
We can go from there.

18:29.576 --> 18:31.909
I appreciate you bringing
it up for us.

18:31.911 --> 18:33.978
[chuckles] this'll
keep us going.

18:35.815 --> 18:37.048
Super cool that steve
showed up with
some pizza for us.

18:37.050 --> 18:38.549
We were hungry.

18:38.551 --> 18:42.720
<i>  I hope that we can get</i>
<i>  enough gold to justify</i>
<i>  keeping steve around.</i>

18:42.722 --> 18:45.089
For now,
if he is going to bring
pizza out here, I'll take it.

18:45.859 --> 18:47.058
Made me thirsty, too.

18:52.866 --> 18:53.998
Stormy!

18:54.033 --> 18:55.533
You are so busted.

18:55.535 --> 18:57.869
He got into the box of pizza.

18:57.871 --> 19:00.972
-Oh, he was go for it.
-[gabe] oh yeah,
he got all of it.

19:01.241 --> 19:02.640
Come here, stormy.

19:02.675 --> 19:04.308
[zeke] stormy!

19:11.718 --> 19:15.052
<i> [narrator] another blizzard</i>
<i>  creeps ever closer to nome.</i>

19:18.892 --> 19:20.391
<i>  But just outside of town...</i>

19:27.333 --> 19:30.334
<i> [narrator] the kellys</i>
<i>  are determined</i>
<i>  to get to the promised land.</i>

19:32.572 --> 19:35.940
We get her from the icy grave,
go beyond the ice today.

19:35.942 --> 19:39.177
<i> [narrator] so, they turn</i>
<i>  to their pal, diesel don</i>

19:39.646 --> 19:41.179
<i>  and his track truck.</i>

19:43.116 --> 19:44.615
[kris] so, right now
the plan's simple.

19:44.617 --> 19:46.617
We'll take this out.

19:46.619 --> 19:51.923
And hopefully,
we'll get this dealt today
pull my sleds to the water.

19:51.925 --> 19:54.192
Because I got to get it
in the water, man.

19:54.727 --> 19:56.294
I got to get there.

19:56.829 --> 20:00.097
We're going to use
diesel don's track truck.

20:00.099 --> 20:03.100
The problem is,
it's under, like,
seven-feet of snow.

20:04.204 --> 20:06.938
<i>  This is a huge pain the ass,</i>
<i>  waste of time,</i>

20:06.940 --> 20:09.407
but if this is what I have
to do to make it work,

20:09.409 --> 20:11.042
then this is what
we're going to do.

20:11.978 --> 20:13.110
[kris] push it.

20:13.112 --> 20:14.412
Come on, baby.

20:15.048 --> 20:16.147
Yeah!

20:16.482 --> 20:18.950
Yeah! Ha!

20:20.587 --> 20:24.956
Oh man, I feel much better.
I was a little whiny, five
minutes ago, but I'm back.

20:24.958 --> 20:26.958
You said, the shows
about to begin.

20:26.960 --> 20:28.259
[kris] let's get going.

20:28.828 --> 20:30.428
The day is not over yet.

20:30.430 --> 20:32.163
And we're not done yet.

20:33.900 --> 20:35.700
Dad, you take
the suction nozzle.

20:35.702 --> 20:37.401
I'll take the pump shack.

20:37.403 --> 20:41.339
Whatever happens,
let's just keep going until
we make this work.

20:44.744 --> 20:46.711
<i> [kris] right now, I've got</i>
<i>  too much crap</i>
<i>  for don to take out.</i>

20:46.713 --> 20:48.980
I'm going to have to
all haul something.

20:48.982 --> 20:51.082
<i>  It just has to</i>
<i>  get out there in one piece,</i>

20:51.084 --> 20:53.150
which I think we'll be
able to handle.

20:57.991 --> 20:59.190
[brad] what the [bleep].

20:59.225 --> 21:00.424
Hey!

21:14.641 --> 21:17.942
Dad just snapped off
about eight feet
of my suction hose.

21:17.944 --> 21:20.411
<i>  Not only did that cost me</i>
<i>  a lot of money.</i>

21:20.413 --> 21:22.546
<i>  But I really needed</i>
<i>  those eight extra feet.</i>

21:22.548 --> 21:26.117
<i>  It could get us through</i>
<i>  the router and get us</i>
<i>  more gold.</i>

21:26.119 --> 21:29.053
This is only going
to make things harder.
And everything sucks already.

21:29.055 --> 21:30.321
Thanks, dad.

21:31.791 --> 21:34.191
We broke the suction hose.

21:34.727 --> 21:36.727
But, you know what,
I just have to get there.

21:36.729 --> 21:39.630
And hope to god,
everything is going
to be fine.

21:39.632 --> 21:42.099
I just hope
my machine makes it there.

22:00.286 --> 22:03.154
And we're out here.
Whoa! We're here.

22:03.156 --> 22:07.091
<i> [kris] hey, it wasn't</i>
<i>  the prettiest job.</i>
<i>  But our stuff's on the ice.</i>

22:07.093 --> 22:08.326
Are we behind? Yes.

22:08.761 --> 22:10.428
Is that bad? Yes.

22:10.430 --> 22:12.830
Did we need that hose?
Hell, yes.

22:12.832 --> 22:15.866
<i>  But right now, I just got to</i>
<i>  focus on the task at hand.</i>

22:15.868 --> 22:19.170
Setting up our operation
and getting some gold.

22:19.172 --> 22:21.539
You know,
the beauty about being me,

22:21.541 --> 22:24.909
is I don't remember
all the bad [bleep]
that happens to me.

22:24.911 --> 22:27.044
You know, that's why
I'm always in a good mood.

22:28.481 --> 22:29.980
[bleep]

22:31.751 --> 22:33.351
<i> [kris] you know, I don't know</i>
<i>  what else to say.</i>

22:33.820 --> 22:35.252
<i>  Ignorance is bliss.</i>

22:38.825 --> 22:40.024
<i> [narrator] one mile west...</i>

22:48.868 --> 22:50.234
How's everything going?

22:51.237 --> 22:53.137
[shawn speaking]

22:53.973 --> 22:56.240
oh, yeah.

22:56.242 --> 22:57.908
<i> [narrator] in</i>
<i>  sub-zero conditions,</i>

22:57.910 --> 23:01.946
<i>  shawn pomrenke's</i>
<i>  hot on the trail</i>
<i>  of a golden jackpot.</i>

23:02.615 --> 23:05.082
[shawn speaking]

23:07.186 --> 23:09.420
<i> [narrator] he's leaving</i>
<i>  no stone unturned.</i>

23:11.524 --> 23:12.656
[shawn speaking]

23:18.131 --> 23:21.265
it's likely that the gold
is around those bigger rocks.

23:22.902 --> 23:24.135
[shawn speaking]

23:39.585 --> 23:40.384
be right back.

23:58.871 --> 24:00.237
[joe] all right,
how's that, shawn?

24:05.945 --> 24:07.378
[shawn speaking]

24:16.823 --> 24:18.989
[shawn speaking]

24:29.936 --> 24:31.068
<i> [joe] hell, yeah.</i>

24:32.972 --> 24:34.972
[shawn speaking]

24:37.877 --> 24:39.376
on to the next hole, eh?

24:39.378 --> 24:41.178
[shawn speaking]

24:45.885 --> 24:48.652
<i>  with all these winter storms</i>
<i>  coming in on top</i>
<i>  of each other,</i>

24:48.654 --> 24:51.789
<i>  we got to move</i>
<i>  fast to stay ahead of them.</i>

24:51.791 --> 24:53.991
You never know
when the next one's
going to hit.

24:55.027 --> 24:57.328
Maybe we clean up this area.

24:57.330 --> 24:59.964
-See what's here?
-Maybe I got old eyes, joe.

24:59.966 --> 25:03.734
My eyes getting old.
Maybe I just can't see
the gold anymore.

25:03.736 --> 25:07.438
-I think so.
-The cleanup will...

25:07.440 --> 25:10.574
-Clean up
will save everything.
-[chuckling] yeah.

25:10.576 --> 25:12.877
I'm going to wrap up this
and wait for the storm to pass

25:12.879 --> 25:15.279
because I don't want
everything to get
buried again.

25:15.581 --> 25:17.648
<i> But I'm feeling good about it.</i>

25:17.650 --> 25:20.050
I feel like, we're right
on track to get that jackpot.

25:20.052 --> 25:22.319
Nothing ventured,
nothing gained.

25:26.993 --> 25:28.325
<i> [narrator] six miles east...</i>

25:31.898 --> 25:33.397
<i> [zeke] it needs to warm up.</i>

25:35.968 --> 25:37.868
Trying to get
this tether blown out.

25:37.870 --> 25:41.071
All the air...
All the water blown out,
before it freezes off.

25:41.574 --> 25:44.008
It turns out
when it's this cold,

25:44.777 --> 25:46.577
really hard to make
a lot of hot water.

25:46.579 --> 25:48.312
It's a cold winter.

25:52.351 --> 25:55.019
<i> [narrator] despite early signs</i>
<i>  of the coming blizzard...</i>

25:55.955 --> 25:57.288
[zeke] we got
a big storm coming in.

25:57.290 --> 26:00.558
So, I'm going to dive for
as long as I have energy
to do it today.

26:00.560 --> 26:04.662
<i> [narrator] zeke tenhoff's</i>
<i>  making the call</i>
<i>  to push ahead with the dive.</i>

26:04.664 --> 26:06.897
It's just one thing
after another,
this cold weather.

26:06.899 --> 26:09.199
It's not ideal to be
exhausting yourself,

26:09.201 --> 26:12.336
moving giant piles
of snow by hand.

26:15.374 --> 26:19.843
And then to have to dive
just right before another big
storm is supposed to hit...

26:19.845 --> 26:21.879
<i>  But you know, I don't really</i>
<i>  have a choice here.</i>

26:21.881 --> 26:23.414
<i>  At least that's how I see it.</i>

26:27.820 --> 26:30.087
I'm a gold miner.
That's who I am.

26:33.326 --> 26:36.060
And I need gold.
And I need badly.

26:36.796 --> 26:39.430
[gabe] we're going to
tie zeke off a safety line

26:41.534 --> 26:43.567
that he can see,
it's bright red.

26:43.569 --> 26:47.204
If anything happens,
he's got a line
right through the hole.

26:48.774 --> 26:51.141
So I'm going to dive.
That's what's going
to happen today.

26:56.882 --> 26:58.716
[steve] it's pretty nasty.

26:58.718 --> 27:00.517
But we're going for it.

27:00.519 --> 27:03.053
[zeke] here we go. Here we go!

27:14.934 --> 27:17.267
All right, it's beautiful
down here today.

27:32.051 --> 27:34.251
Wonderful, I'm so happy
to be home.

27:35.755 --> 27:37.187
It's all clear.

27:38.858 --> 27:40.257
[steve] what you got
going there, zeke?

27:40.993 --> 27:42.960
[zeke] there's no stress
out here at all.

27:42.962 --> 27:44.161
Everything's perfect
down here.

27:46.032 --> 27:47.364
I like the ground.

27:50.102 --> 27:52.202
<i>  Just any cobble...</i>

27:54.206 --> 27:56.373
That I'm seeing, uh...

28:01.147 --> 28:02.546
Yeah, money!

28:02.548 --> 28:04.481
[screams excitedly]

28:04.483 --> 28:08.185
<i> [zeke] I really appreciate</i>
<i>  you guys sticking with me.</i>

28:09.889 --> 28:13.857
It makes me so happy
that we were able to
accomplish this today.

28:13.859 --> 28:16.860
Yeah, there was grind
getting him down there.

28:16.862 --> 28:19.830
I just wanna, like,
put in a bunch of hours

28:19.832 --> 28:23.133
and just move all of
this stuff that's mounted up.

28:23.936 --> 28:26.937
There's a big storm coming in
so we got to get some gold

28:26.939 --> 28:28.338
and get out of here
before the storm comes.

28:28.641 --> 28:29.973
Yeah.

28:38.818 --> 28:40.117
[zeke] just do
a hole right there.

28:41.921 --> 28:43.320
All right.

28:45.524 --> 28:47.858
<i> [narrator] the next storm</i>
<i>  is looming.</i>

28:47.860 --> 28:49.927
<i> [kris] it was really rough</i>
<i>  getting out here.</i>

28:49.929 --> 28:52.196
But you know what,
that's why we had
to push through.

28:52.198 --> 28:55.132
So, we can get out here
today and kill it.

28:58.204 --> 28:59.670
Fingers crossed.

28:59.672 --> 29:03.907
<i> [narrator] and kris is rushing</i>
<i>  to set up camp</i>
<i>  before it strikes.</i>

29:03.909 --> 29:06.543
Get our ice box,
we dunk it under the water
and push it under the ice.

29:06.545 --> 29:08.078
<i> [kris] we're behind.</i>

29:08.080 --> 29:11.482
The very least,
we need the operation set up,
a dive pool ready

29:11.484 --> 29:13.951
<i>  and everything tied down.</i>

29:13.953 --> 29:15.319
<i>  It's embarrassing</i>
<i>  we're only at this stage.</i>

29:15.321 --> 29:18.055
But at this point,
we just need to hustle
and get this done.

29:18.057 --> 29:20.958
So, this is like
an ice-cube in a drink,
except it's really big.

29:20.960 --> 29:22.926
We, all together,
need to push it

29:22.928 --> 29:26.063
underneath the shack,
that way.

29:26.065 --> 29:27.898
-You guys got it?
-[man] got it, yeah.

29:27.900 --> 29:29.967
[kris] four corners,
four people, let's go.

29:33.139 --> 29:35.139
Oh come on.
Don't come back up.

29:36.008 --> 29:37.775
Well, I don't like that.

29:37.777 --> 29:39.009
I don't know where it went to.

29:39.512 --> 29:41.145
Did it already go?

29:42.114 --> 29:44.414
I don't know. That was
the easiest chunk
I've ever done.

29:45.017 --> 29:47.117
Hey, one chunk down.

29:47.119 --> 29:49.286
This is done. That's done.

29:49.655 --> 29:51.121
[man] careful, get--

29:51.457 --> 29:55.993
-come on.
-[bleep] my foot's
wedged, too.

29:55.995 --> 29:59.029
-Hold on. I got find
the [bleep] before...
-How did he find the hole?

29:59.031 --> 30:00.798
Stupid is. Stupid does.

30:00.800 --> 30:03.133
-[brad] I knew you were
going to fall.
-[bleep] you.

30:03.135 --> 30:04.768
-[bleep]
-[brad] you followed me here.
Come on.

30:04.770 --> 30:05.836
[bleep] you again.

30:05.838 --> 30:08.138
<i>  As you can see,</i>
<i>  it's slightly dangerous.</i>

30:08.674 --> 30:11.375
Tip of the week,
don't fall in the hole.

30:11.377 --> 30:13.143
Just in case,
you don't know that.

30:15.915 --> 30:17.915
Maybe we should have
a "kris' guide to mining"
right now.

30:17.917 --> 30:19.283
[all laugh]

30:21.587 --> 30:24.154
always bring
extra socks for kris.

30:25.124 --> 30:27.257
Because he'll find the hole,
no matter what.

30:27.693 --> 30:29.126
[laughs]

30:30.696 --> 30:32.296
[kris] good job, everybody.

30:32.598 --> 30:34.364
I wish I could get
a dive in today.

30:34.366 --> 30:37.701
But there's no way
we're going to pull that off
before this storm hits.

30:37.703 --> 30:40.704
<i>  But we're set to</i>
<i>  hit the ground running</i>
<i>  with this killer gear.</i>

30:40.706 --> 30:42.406
<i>  So I'm going to call</i>
<i>  today a victory.</i>

30:42.408 --> 30:44.107
Now, we're back on track.

30:46.912 --> 30:49.146
<i> [narrator] as</i>
<i>  the kellys head in...</i>

30:53.052 --> 30:56.119
<i>  The storm has reached</i>
<i>  nome's coastline.</i>

31:00.359 --> 31:01.625
<i>  Two miles west...</i>

31:07.666 --> 31:11.335
Hey, bud. I heard
we're onto something good.
Tell me about it.

31:12.938 --> 31:15.572
[zeke] the gold here
is looking really consistent.

31:15.574 --> 31:16.874
I'm stoked.

31:16.876 --> 31:20.944
<i> [narrator] zeke tenhoff,</i>
<i>  is still under the ice.</i>

31:20.946 --> 31:23.380
I want to try to like,
ridge it for a while,

31:23.382 --> 31:25.916
before the storm hits.

31:25.918 --> 31:29.386
<i> [steve] you might as well</i>
<i>  pound it as hard as possible,</i>
<i>  until we got to leave.</i>

31:30.723 --> 31:31.688
<i> [zeke] that I can do.</i>

31:31.690 --> 31:33.991
It's what god put me here for.

31:40.532 --> 31:44.001
It's [bleep] now.
It's just going to get
worse here soon.

31:51.877 --> 31:54.411
-It's getting nasty out here.
<i> -[zeke] yeah, I'm...</i>

31:58.817 --> 32:01.351
Well, yeah. [bleep].

32:02.922 --> 32:04.388
Get your little ass up top.

32:04.390 --> 32:06.290
Back into the cold.

32:08.827 --> 32:12.963
Zeke put in a few hours.
He's coming up.
We're getting out of here.

32:17.736 --> 32:19.569
I'm proud of us for pushing
as hard as we did today.

32:19.571 --> 32:21.872
It's horrible up here.

32:21.874 --> 32:24.775
We got a few
hours of diving in,
before the storm rolled in.

32:24.777 --> 32:28.879
<i>  But, honestly, like,</i>
<i>  this is not going to cut it.</i>

32:28.881 --> 32:32.215
We need a major sea change.
And we need it to happen soon.

32:32.551 --> 32:34.685
I'm ready to go home.

32:34.687 --> 32:37.220
-It's cold.
-Yeah, let's get out of here.
Let's go home.

32:43.729 --> 32:45.329
<i> [narrator] four miles east...</i>

32:47.366 --> 32:50.334
<i>  One team</i>
<i>  has yet to call it quits.</i>

32:53.772 --> 32:58.976
[vernon] okay. Gary,
everything working down there?
You seeing some good pieces?

32:59.712 --> 33:02.112
[diver] yeah, there's about
12 of them right here.

33:04.550 --> 33:08.151
Look there's a bunch more,
right there.

33:08.153 --> 33:11.555
Hell, we might be on,
better than super gold,
you never know.

33:11.557 --> 33:13.790
All right, buddy.

33:13.792 --> 33:15.826
<i>  We were hoping</i>
<i> to start the season out right.</i>

33:15.828 --> 33:16.860
And hell, yeah.

33:16.862 --> 33:18.695
The gold is rolling in.

33:18.697 --> 33:21.264
<i> [diver] look at that gold,</i>
<i>  look at it. Whoo!</i>

33:21.266 --> 33:22.766
I think, we're going to do
really good here.

33:22.768 --> 33:27.904
I want 200 ounces
this winter, and I'm pushing
as hard as I can.

33:27.906 --> 33:30.974
When we're on gold like this,
come to daddy.

33:30.976 --> 33:32.242
Gold daddy.

33:35.881 --> 33:37.114
What the hell is it doing?

33:41.086 --> 33:42.319
[bleep]. It's storming.

33:43.889 --> 33:45.055
We got to go.

33:45.824 --> 33:48.191
We got to go. We go to go.

33:53.499 --> 33:56.400
Gary, I'm calling it.
We're going to pull you.

33:56.402 --> 33:59.970
<i>  We got a big blow coming in.</i>
<i>  The weather just changed.</i>

33:59.972 --> 34:03.640
<i>  All of a sudden we got</i>
<i>  a damn mini blizzard</i>
<i>  blowing out there.</i>

34:03.642 --> 34:05.242
[gary] coming up.

34:09.114 --> 34:11.014
We need to get everything
shut down,

34:11.016 --> 34:12.983
blown out for good.

34:12.985 --> 34:15.285
And get on shore
while we still can.

34:23.395 --> 34:27.197
Definitely nasty out.
Here comes the big storm.

34:33.272 --> 34:35.005
It is what it is.

34:37.076 --> 34:39.409
We're able to see
may be 30-yards.

34:40.012 --> 34:41.978
And that's about it.

34:46.018 --> 34:48.018
Hey, guys,
time to shut it down.

34:48.020 --> 34:49.352
Better safe than sorry.

34:49.855 --> 34:51.788
It's terrible.

34:51.790 --> 34:53.290
Sun was shining earlier,
wasn't it?

34:53.926 --> 34:55.125
An hour ago?

35:05.504 --> 35:06.703
You want it right here?
Right here?

35:06.972 --> 35:07.904
-Which exact point--
-[producer] right over
the hole there.

35:07.906 --> 35:09.406
And hood up or down?

35:09.408 --> 35:11.141
-[cameraman] already
on a roll.
-Okay, whatever.

35:11.176 --> 35:13.210
Bam! Let's do it.

35:15.514 --> 35:19.382
Hello, and welcome to another
episode of "kris kelly secret
guide to successful mining."

35:19.384 --> 35:21.852
today, we're going to
be talking about blizzards.

35:21.854 --> 35:24.087
And how much of a pain
in the ass they are.

35:27.626 --> 35:32.395
We're not snow removal
professionals, but in this
industry, yes you are.

35:32.397 --> 35:34.731
Today, I'm going to bring in
my sexy assistant, andy.

35:34.733 --> 35:37.000
And he's going to be
taking care of
all the snow removal,

35:37.002 --> 35:40.337
while I stand there
and "supervise"
the situation.

35:43.041 --> 35:45.842
Come on.
It's your [bleep] cue.

35:45.844 --> 35:47.844
Thank god, we can edit this.

35:47.846 --> 35:50.247
[cameraman] is there any,
like, special technique
to removing snow around?

35:50.249 --> 35:51.414
No.

35:52.351 --> 35:55.118
So, as you can tell,
andy moves
a lot of snow very fast.

35:55.120 --> 35:58.989
Andy understands
that we don't make
any money moving snow.

36:02.794 --> 36:04.461
I'm almost done.

36:04.463 --> 36:06.897
[cameraman] so, what else
can you say about...

36:06.899 --> 36:10.033
Not a [bleep] thing.
Can't say [bleep]
more about snow removal.

36:10.035 --> 36:14.037
Everybody has done it at home.
If you haven't seen it at home
you've seen it in the movies.

36:15.073 --> 36:16.506
There you go. Come on.

36:16.508 --> 36:17.707
And there you go
with another episode

36:17.709 --> 36:21.077
of "kris kelly's secret guide
to successful mining."

36:21.079 --> 36:23.980
I'm going to get out there
and kick his [bleep]
ass right now.

36:23.982 --> 36:25.215
Get working.

36:25.817 --> 36:27.617
Just get to work.

36:27.619 --> 36:29.252
-[andy] we are.
-[kris] get to work.

36:33.825 --> 36:35.125
<i> [narrator] in nome, alaska,...</i>

36:42.401 --> 36:44.034
[vernon] how we doing?

36:44.570 --> 36:45.869
[gary] getting little chunks.

36:45.871 --> 36:47.704
Oh, yeah. Look at that
one right there.

36:47.706 --> 36:50.707
[vernon] yeah,
that's some gold there.

36:50.709 --> 36:52.642
<i> [narrator] for</i>
<i>  vernon adkinson,</i>
<i>  it's time to see</i>

36:52.644 --> 36:56.112
<i>  if his super gold spot</i>
<i>  is still super.</i>

36:56.882 --> 36:58.181
[vernon] down
to the bottom, huh?

37:01.787 --> 37:03.853
[gary] I'm liking it.

37:03.855 --> 37:06.756
[vernon] so far,
we've definitely got gold
in the gold cube.

37:06.758 --> 37:08.892
I wish the storm
didn't kick us out.

37:08.894 --> 37:11.294
But gary put in
some serious hours
on the box.

37:14.199 --> 37:16.633
[gary] yeah, not too bad,
not too bad.

37:16.668 --> 37:17.567
Here.

37:17.569 --> 37:20.704
There does seem
quiet a bit in the top.

37:20.706 --> 37:24.007
<i>  I'm anxious to see</i>
<i>  how well we do</i>
<i>  on this clean up.</i>

37:24.009 --> 37:25.842
I'm looking to set
a personal record.

37:25.844 --> 37:29.346
I'm thinking it's going
to be loaded with a capital l.

37:30.716 --> 37:32.382
[gary] well, yeah,
what do you think?

37:32.384 --> 37:36.186
-I'm going to go with nine.
Nine ounces. Yeah.
-Nine?

37:37.122 --> 37:39.155
-[vernon] oh, there's one.
-[gary] one.

37:39.891 --> 37:41.024
[both] two.

37:42.060 --> 37:43.059
Come on baby.

37:43.061 --> 37:44.327
Three.

37:46.098 --> 37:47.831
Four, five.

37:47.833 --> 37:49.232
Six, seven.

37:50.802 --> 37:52.002
Eight.

37:54.773 --> 37:56.339
Eight point nine five.

37:56.875 --> 37:58.341
<i> [narrator] 8.95 ounces</i>

37:58.977 --> 38:01.111
<i>  is worth over $17,000.</i>

38:01.413 --> 38:02.679
[gary] nice.

38:02.914 --> 38:05.382
We're getting
our bearings, we're getting
things dialed in.

38:05.384 --> 38:06.916
And, hey, we're on the gold.

38:06.918 --> 38:08.051
Yup.

38:08.053 --> 38:10.687
How sweet it is.
First hole. First dive.

38:10.689 --> 38:13.390
And, in the money already.

38:13.392 --> 38:15.759
<i>  As long as, mother nature</i>
<i>  stays off my back,</i>

38:15.761 --> 38:19.095
we got a good shot
at getting our
200 ounces of gold.

38:19.097 --> 38:21.531
Yeah, let's get back out there
and get some more.

38:21.533 --> 38:22.432
Let's get it all.

38:23.802 --> 38:27.170
<i>  Remember, we leave</i>
<i>  no gold behind.</i>

38:29.775 --> 38:31.374
<i> [narrator] on the other side</i>
<i>  of town...</i>

38:38.350 --> 38:41.418
Nothing easy about mining
in this winter.

38:41.420 --> 38:45.922
Get everything out,
get ready to mine,
next day, storm.

38:45.924 --> 38:49.259
If it was easy,
the gold would be gone
a long time ago.

38:51.663 --> 38:53.963
<i> [narrator] as the snow</i>
<i>  piles up outside...</i>

38:54.199 --> 38:55.732
We're definitely on the trail.

38:55.734 --> 38:59.202
Definitely close to
something big.

38:59.204 --> 39:02.839
It's just a matter of,
if we can get enough time
at the bottom

39:02.841 --> 39:05.175
to suck it up.

39:05.177 --> 39:06.976
<i> [narrator] the gold</i>
<i>  is piling up.</i>

39:07.045 --> 39:08.311
<i>  Inside.</i>

39:09.881 --> 39:12.015
We haven't hit
the jackpot yet.

39:12.017 --> 39:14.184
<i>  But so far, we've been doing</i>
<i>  pretty good.</i>

39:15.687 --> 39:16.419
Ohh!

39:16.922 --> 39:19.055
Still warm, still warm.

39:20.826 --> 39:22.892
Let's see what
we got here, joe.

39:22.894 --> 39:24.194
[joe] she's looking good.

39:26.131 --> 39:28.098
[shawn] seven, eight, nine,

39:28.900 --> 39:29.432
ten.

39:30.001 --> 39:31.067
12.

39:33.872 --> 39:36.973
13.40.

39:37.909 --> 39:39.242
We're on the trail
of something.

39:39.244 --> 39:40.243
Oh, yeah.

39:40.245 --> 39:44.848
<i> [narrator] 13.4 ounces</i>
<i>  is worth over 25 grand.</i>

39:44.850 --> 39:49.352
<i>  And shawn is right on pace,</i>
<i>  to hit his 120 ounce</i>
<i>  goal for winter.</i>

39:50.689 --> 39:52.756
It wasn't showing
but it was worth it.

39:52.758 --> 39:54.891
Yeah, I mean, we're seeing it.

39:54.893 --> 39:57.827
Seeing it, but I think,
we can get on
something better.

39:57.829 --> 39:59.729
Yeah, I think so too.

39:59.731 --> 40:02.866
With these numbers
and this type of material,

40:02.868 --> 40:05.168
we're right on the cusp
of something amazing.

40:05.604 --> 40:06.970
<i>  I can feel it.</i>

40:07.406 --> 40:09.706
Got to find it.
And find it fast.

40:09.708 --> 40:10.840
So, I can rock it this summer.

40:10.842 --> 40:13.076
We need to fill up this jar.

40:13.879 --> 40:15.011
-[joe] hell yeah.
-[shawn] not this one.

40:15.013 --> 40:16.413
[joe] mmm-hmm.

40:17.949 --> 40:19.849
<i> [shawn] we're on</i>
<i>  the trail now.</i>

40:19.851 --> 40:21.151
<i>  We need to keep it up.</i>

40:23.422 --> 40:25.588
<i> [narrator] next time,</i>
<i>  on bering sea gold...</i>

40:25.590 --> 40:27.757
[man] first tide of
the season.

40:27.759 --> 40:32.395
My chance to go make
the gold and see what
we're standing on right now.

40:32.397 --> 40:34.431
[shawn] gonna be
a beautiful day for diving.

40:38.503 --> 40:39.669
[bleep]

40:39.671 --> 40:41.938
<i> [vernon] we're getting</i>
<i>  michael suited up</i>

40:41.940 --> 40:43.973
<i>  it'll be his first dive</i>
<i>  with us.</i>

40:43.975 --> 40:44.908
We'll see how he does.

40:44.910 --> 40:45.675
[michael speaking]

40:45.677 --> 40:48.044
I think I heard him say,
"pay day."

40:48.046 --> 40:50.947
<i> [zeke] everything's set up</i>
<i>  for a long, awesome</i>
<i>  dive day today.</i>

40:50.949 --> 40:52.382
<i>  Couldn't be happier.</i>

40:52.384 --> 40:54.017
Okay, this won't do.

40:58.523 --> 41:00.089
He just needs a longer hose.

41:00.091 --> 41:02.992
I'm sure his girlfriend's
told that lots of times.

41:02.994 --> 41:05.261
[diver speaking]

41:05.263 --> 41:06.262
oh, [bleep] dammit.

41:08.934 --> 41:11.067
[diver] yeah, man,
I'm seeing good gold.

41:11.203 --> 41:12.402
[bleep] dang.

41:12.404 --> 41:13.870
[screams]

41:13.872 --> 41:15.004
are you okay?

41:16.107 --> 41:17.240
It's me.

41:17.242 --> 41:18.208
[gasping]
