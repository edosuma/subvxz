08:32.804 --> 08:36.141
Oh, yeah, yeah, alright.

08:32.804 --> 08:36.141
Come on, come on, son.

08:37.976 --> 08:40.812
There's Derek.

08:37.976 --> 08:40.812
Let's throw the frisbee.

08:42.689 --> 08:45.775
Derek, why are you eating?

08:42.689 --> 08:45.775
Lunch isn't for an hour.

08:45.817 --> 08:50.489
I just can't get through recess

08:45.817 --> 08:50.489
without a rice cake.

08:50.530 --> 08:53.325
Save some for me.

08:50.530 --> 08:53.325
I forgot to bring my lunch.

08:53.367 --> 08:56.286
Then, you should buy your lunch

08:53.367 --> 08:56.286
in the cafeteria.

08:56.328 --> 08:57.745
I'm not allowed

08:56.328 --> 08:57.745
to buy my lunch.

08:57.787 --> 08:59.039
Why not?

08:59.080 --> 09:02.501
Because my dad makes

08:59.080 --> 09:02.501
my jelly smile.

09:02.542 --> 09:05.795
Okay.

09:05.837 --> 09:07.464
Hey, let's throw the frisbee.

09:10.717 --> 09:14.137
You know, my dog can catch

09:10.717 --> 09:14.137
one of these in his mouth.

09:15.847 --> 09:17.432
So can my brother.

09:19.893 --> 09:22.062
Okay, here it goes.

09:27.775 --> 09:32.572
Wow. It just floated

09:27.775 --> 09:32.572
right up there.

09:32.613 --> 09:35.283
Why don't you float up

09:32.613 --> 09:35.283
there and get it?

09:36.951 --> 09:40.663
[clicks tongue]

09:36.951 --> 09:40.663
I'll go. I'm not afraid

09:36.951 --> 09:40.663
of climbing that.

09:40.705 --> 09:42.999
Me, neither. Let's do it.

09:45.252 --> 09:49.381
Come on, Michelle.

09:45.252 --> 09:49.381
Are you afraid to come up?

09:49.423 --> 09:52.342
No, I'm just afraid

09:49.423 --> 09:52.342
to come down really hard.

09:54.219 --> 09:57.222
Don't worry.

09:54.219 --> 09:57.222
It's easy.

10:01.809 --> 10:03.728
Hey, honey.

10:01.809 --> 10:03.728
Look, you forgot your lunch.

10:03.770 --> 10:05.813
Thanks, dad.

10:05.855 --> 10:08.649
You know what?

10:05.855 --> 10:08.649
You forgot something else.

10:08.691 --> 10:11.694
Ah! Must have fallen off

10:08.691 --> 10:11.694
your head on the way to school.

10:11.736 --> 10:14.364
Actually, Comet found it.

10:14.406 --> 10:16.324
It was really funny.

10:14.406 --> 10:16.324
He was wearing it.

10:17.658 --> 10:20.078
It was the cutest thing

10:17.658 --> 10:20.078
you ever saw.

10:21.413 --> 10:24.207
Uh, got to go, dad.

10:21.413 --> 10:24.207
We have a frisbee situation.

10:24.249 --> 10:26.084
(Danny)

10:24.249 --> 10:26.084
'Oh, hold on, Michelle,

10:24.249 --> 10:26.084
I don't want you climbing'

10:26.126 --> 10:28.587
up there, sweetheart.

10:26.126 --> 10:28.587
That's really dangerous.

10:28.628 --> 10:30.797
There you go.

10:30.838 --> 10:35.385
Hey, Michelle. This is cool.

10:35.427 --> 10:38.638
I can see the top

10:35.427 --> 10:38.638
of your dad's head.

10:41.182 --> 10:44.352
Denise, I want you to come down

10:41.182 --> 10:44.352
from there right now, honey.

10:46.020 --> 10:48.273
That's it. Good.

10:48.315 --> 10:49.983
Coming over that pole.

10:50.024 --> 10:52.444
Very slowly. That's it.

10:52.486 --> 10:54.613
'Just be careful.'

10:54.654 --> 10:56.281
Okay.

10:56.323 --> 10:57.657
I would have been careful.

10:57.698 --> 10:59.742
Oh, I know you would

10:57.698 --> 10:59.742
have been, sweetheart.

10:59.784 --> 11:01.702
I tell you what, why don't

10:59.784 --> 11:01.702
you go play on the teeter-totter

11:01.744 --> 11:03.580
right now, okay, and I promise

11:01.744 --> 11:03.580
when you come home

11:03.622 --> 11:06.124
I'll show you

11:03.622 --> 11:06.124
the top of my head, okay?

11:06.166 --> 11:08.793
I gotta go pick up Vicky

11:06.166 --> 11:08.793
so if you would..

11:08.835 --> 11:10.545
...wear that.

11:10.587 --> 11:12.922
Now let me give you

11:10.587 --> 11:12.922
a big kiss goodbye.

11:17.302 --> 11:19.804
What's wrong?

11:19.846 --> 11:22.307
- I don't want a kiss.

11:19.846 --> 11:22.307
- Why not?

11:22.349 --> 11:25.477
Stop treating me

11:22.349 --> 11:25.477
like a little baby.

11:25.519 --> 11:27.395
[bell ringing]

11:39.991 --> 11:42.785
Danny, it was one

11:39.991 --> 11:42.785
of the greatest stories

11:42.827 --> 11:44.496
I-I ever covered.

11:44.538 --> 11:47.165
When the sultan agreed

11:44.538 --> 11:47.165
to let me interview him

11:47.207 --> 11:48.667
I thought I would die.

11:48.707 --> 11:50.751
Uh-huh.

11:50.793 --> 11:55.173
And everything was going great

11:50.793 --> 11:55.173
until that camel exploded.

11:55.215 --> 11:57.384
Yeah, that can happen.

11:57.425 --> 11:59.260
Did you know

11:57.425 --> 11:59.260
that those humps are filled

11:59.302 --> 12:02.889
with, uh, candy like a pinata?

12:02.930 --> 12:04.683
Life's like that.

12:06.685 --> 12:09.312
Are those, uh, scuff marks

12:06.685 --> 12:09.312
on your kitchen floor?

12:09.354 --> 12:11.565
What? I just waxed.

12:09.354 --> 12:11.565
Where?

12:11.606 --> 12:14.984
Well, I finally

12:11.606 --> 12:14.984
got your attention.

12:15.026 --> 12:17.070
Oh, well, well,

12:15.026 --> 12:17.070
I'm sorry, Vicky.

12:17.111 --> 12:19.531
I can't stop thinking

12:17.111 --> 12:19.531
about Michelle.

12:19.573 --> 12:22.075
Why wouldn't she kiss me?

12:22.116 --> 12:24.661
Do I embarrass her?

12:24.703 --> 12:26.454
I didn't start to embarrass

12:24.703 --> 12:26.454
D.J. or Stephanie

12:26.496 --> 12:28.831
until they were

12:26.496 --> 12:28.831
at least 10 or 11.

12:28.873 --> 12:31.125
Well, kids nowadays

12:28.873 --> 12:31.125
get embarrassed

12:31.167 --> 12:33.378
by their parents

12:31.167 --> 12:33.378
at a much younger age.

12:35.046 --> 12:37.591
- Hi, Stephanie. Hi, Michelle.

12:35.046 --> 12:37.591
- 'Hey, Vicky. Hi, dad.'

12:37.632 --> 12:39.342
- Hey, Steph.

12:37.632 --> 12:39.342
- Hi, Vicky.

12:39.384 --> 12:41.052
Hi, honey.

12:41.094 --> 12:42.721
Father.

12:47.308 --> 12:49.143
Did you see that?

12:49.185 --> 12:51.605
She's so angry with me.

12:51.646 --> 12:53.856
She said I treat her

12:51.646 --> 12:53.856
like a baby.

12:53.898 --> 12:57.527
Well, dad, sometimes you can

12:53.898 --> 12:57.527
be a little overprotective.

12:57.569 --> 13:00.071
- Me?

12:57.569 --> 13:00.071
- Yeah.

13:00.113 --> 13:02.574
Last week, I was at the mall

13:00.113 --> 13:02.574
talking to Lucas Killian

13:02.616 --> 13:04.951
the cutest boy in my class.

13:04.992 --> 13:07.036
Dad notices my shoes were untied

13:07.078 --> 13:10.665
so he gets down on the floor

13:07.078 --> 13:10.665
to tie them.

13:10.707 --> 13:13.167
I was afraid you would trip.

13:13.209 --> 13:15.253
I did...over you.

13:17.130 --> 13:19.132
Hey, guys.

13:17.130 --> 13:19.132
Hey, I need your help.

13:19.173 --> 13:21.884
I'm-I'm finally close

13:19.173 --> 13:21.884
to making a decision, okay?

13:21.926 --> 13:23.553
Now, you guys tell me

13:21.926 --> 13:23.553
which cup you like

13:23.595 --> 13:25.179
for the Smash Club, alright?

13:25.221 --> 13:27.390
This one says,

13:25.221 --> 13:27.390
"Here's a club that gives me

13:27.432 --> 13:29.016
a lot of value for my money."

13:29.058 --> 13:32.103
And this one says,

13:29.058 --> 13:32.103
"Boy, this place must be hip

13:32.145 --> 13:33.938
'cause I'm getting ripped off."

13:36.107 --> 13:38.234
Hey, Uncle Jesse, some guy

13:36.107 --> 13:38.234
just brought some more samples.

13:38.276 --> 13:40.111
- They're in the living room.

13:38.276 --> 13:40.111
- Okay.

13:40.153 --> 13:43.030
More samples.

13:40.153 --> 13:43.030
Jess, you gotta do something.

13:43.072 --> 13:45.158
This place is starting

13:43.072 --> 13:45.158
to look like a showroom.

13:45.199 --> 13:46.993
I mean, neighbors

13:45.199 --> 13:46.993
are starting to browse.

13:47.034 --> 13:48.453
Alright, alright, alright.

13:47.034 --> 13:48.453
You know what?

13:48.495 --> 13:51.038
I'm-I'm ready to sit down

13:48.495 --> 13:51.038
and make a decision.

13:51.080 --> 13:52.915
And I've got just the place

13:51.080 --> 13:52.915
for you to sit.

13:52.957 --> 13:54.292
Good.

13:59.297 --> 14:01.132
You know,

13:59.297 --> 14:01.132
it's an interesting look but..

14:01.174 --> 14:03.510
...personally, I would

14:01.174 --> 14:03.510
have gone with chairs.

14:05.303 --> 14:06.971
Wh-wh-what is this?

14:07.013 --> 14:10.183
What did, I-I wanted

14:07.013 --> 14:10.183
a catalog or something.

14:10.224 --> 14:11.601
Well, good luck, Uncle Jesse.

14:11.643 --> 14:14.312
And, uh, don't forget

14:11.643 --> 14:14.312
to put the seat down.

14:22.987 --> 14:25.948
Oh, sorry.

14:22.987 --> 14:25.948
I'll come back later.

14:25.990 --> 14:28.242
Get back here.

14:28.284 --> 14:29.786
I'm in trouble.

14:29.828 --> 14:31.746
Well, try

14:29.828 --> 14:31.746
reading the newspaper.

14:31.788 --> 14:33.581
It always works for me.

14:36.626 --> 14:38.252
I mean, I-I can't

14:36.626 --> 14:38.252
make a decision, Joey.

14:38.294 --> 14:40.588
This whole thing

14:38.294 --> 14:40.588
is so overwhelming.

14:40.630 --> 14:42.048
The-the-the Smash Club,

14:40.630 --> 14:42.048
you know what?

14:42.089 --> 14:43.633
It's going right down the..

14:43.675 --> 14:45.844
Well, you get the picture.

14:45.885 --> 14:47.928
I don't know what to do.

14:49.514 --> 14:51.349
- Jess.

14:49.514 --> 14:51.349
- Hmm?

14:51.391 --> 14:53.226
Don't get up.

14:53.267 --> 14:55.729
Would you like, uh, chicken

14:53.267 --> 14:55.729
or hamburger for dinner?

14:55.770 --> 14:57.271
Becky, I don't know.

14:55.770 --> 14:57.271
I don't know.

14:57.313 --> 14:58.732
I can't,

14:57.313 --> 14:58.732
I-I can't take it anymore.

14:58.773 --> 15:00.316
I don't know,

14:58.773 --> 15:00.316
I can't take the pressure.

15:00.358 --> 15:02.777
- Okay, fish.

15:00.358 --> 15:02.777
- Fine, fine.

15:02.819 --> 15:04.237
I give up. You know what,

15:02.819 --> 15:04.237
I just, I give up.

15:04.278 --> 15:05.864
Honey, you know what?

15:04.278 --> 15:05.864
You're right. You are.

15:05.905 --> 15:07.574
You're putting much too

15:05.905 --> 15:07.574
much pressure on yourself.

15:07.615 --> 15:09.659
Now just sit down here..

15:11.327 --> 15:12.704
Actually, we can do

15:11.327 --> 15:12.704
this standing.

15:12.746 --> 15:14.414
Yeah.

15:14.455 --> 15:16.916
Now, sweetheart,

15:14.455 --> 15:16.916
think back a little bit.

15:16.957 --> 15:20.545
What was the easiest

15:16.957 --> 15:20.545
decision you ever made?

15:20.587 --> 15:24.632
Well, the day

15:20.587 --> 15:24.632
I decided to marry you.

15:24.674 --> 15:26.217
Aw!

15:27.594 --> 15:30.221
And why was that so easy?

15:30.263 --> 15:31.681
'Cause I knew I loved you

15:31.723 --> 15:34.392
and I had this

15:31.723 --> 15:34.392
incredibly good feeling.

15:34.434 --> 15:37.019
Okay, which toilet gives you

15:37.061 --> 15:39.480
that same

15:37.061 --> 15:39.480
incredibly good feeling?

15:41.982 --> 15:44.402
I don't know. We just met.

15:44.444 --> 15:46.696
Oh, come on, Jess,

15:44.444 --> 15:46.696
which one of these beauties

15:46.738 --> 15:49.532
can you see yourself

15:46.738 --> 15:49.532
walking down the beach with?

15:51.117 --> 15:53.453
Well, promise

15:51.117 --> 15:53.453
you won't get jealous?

16:02.545 --> 16:05.089
To be honest with you,

16:02.545 --> 16:05.089
I did get a little tingly

16:05.131 --> 16:07.258
when I saw this one.

16:07.300 --> 16:11.512
Well, you've just selected

16:07.300 --> 16:11.512
"The Flush Master 2000."

16:11.554 --> 16:15.182
It's a dandy for your fanny.

16:15.224 --> 16:17.143
"Chicago 60609."

16:17.184 --> 16:20.480
Congratulations, Jess.

16:17.184 --> 16:20.480
You've just made a decision.

16:20.521 --> 16:22.899
Yeah. I did, didn't I?

16:22.941 --> 16:24.525
Feels kind of good.

16:22.941 --> 16:24.525
You know, here's the catch.

16:24.567 --> 16:26.110
I just gotta go

16:24.567 --> 16:26.110
with my instinct, that's all.

16:26.152 --> 16:28.655
I think it's gonna

16:26.152 --> 16:28.655
to be beautiful.

16:28.696 --> 16:30.114
Thank you.

16:31.908 --> 16:33.200
Potty.

16:33.242 --> 16:35.286
Oh, not just any potty, son.

16:35.328 --> 16:38.498
That's The Flush Master 2000.

Jess, he's serious. He's

16:40.207 --> 16:42.794
finally ready to use the potty.

16:42.836 --> 16:46.923
My man. Whoa, no, no, no, son.

16:42.836 --> 16:46.923
No, son.

16:46.965 --> 16:48.842
These are loaners.

16:50.718 --> 16:53.053
Uh, uh, ahem.

16:53.095 --> 16:56.015
This might help you out, buddy.

16:56.056 --> 16:57.767
Thank you, Joey.

17:07.861 --> 17:10.947
- Hi, Michelle.

17:07.861 --> 17:10.947
- Hi.

17:10.989 --> 17:13.950
I know you're upset

17:10.989 --> 17:13.950
about what happened today.

17:13.992 --> 17:18.245
- And I think I understand why.

17:13.992 --> 17:18.245
- Why?

17:18.287 --> 17:24.043
Well, honey, I've-I've been

17:18.287 --> 17:24.043
having a hard time letting go.

17:24.084 --> 17:26.253
After all, you're my last baby.

17:26.295 --> 17:29.215
I mean, um,

17:26.295 --> 17:29.215
you're my last big girl

17:29.256 --> 17:32.886
And-and from now on, that's how

17:29.256 --> 17:32.886
I'm gonna be treating you.

17:32.927 --> 17:34.470
Like a big girl.

17:34.512 --> 17:37.640
- Really?

17:34.512 --> 17:37.640
- Really.

17:37.682 --> 17:41.185
Can I pick out my own clothes?

17:41.227 --> 17:43.646
Yeah, I think you're ready.

17:43.688 --> 17:46.983
Can I...bring lunch money?

17:47.025 --> 17:50.904
[chuckles]

17:47.025 --> 17:50.904
Long as you don't blow it

17:47.025 --> 17:50.904
all on pudding.

17:50.945 --> 17:53.239
Can I get a tattoo?

17:55.115 --> 17:57.201
Only if it washes off

17:55.115 --> 17:57.201
in the tub, okay?

17:57.243 --> 17:59.245
Alright, deal.

17:59.286 --> 18:01.247
Okay.

18:01.288 --> 18:03.457
And, and, sweetheart.

18:03.499 --> 18:07.420
Look, if, uh, if it embarrasses

18:03.499 --> 18:07.420
you when I kiss you

18:07.461 --> 18:09.171
I'm gonna,

18:07.461 --> 18:09.171
I'm gonna try to remember it

18:09.213 --> 18:11.424
and respect that, okay?

18:11.465 --> 18:13.760
Thanks.

18:13.801 --> 18:17.388
Okay.

18:13.801 --> 18:17.388
Goodnight, Michelle.

18:17.430 --> 18:19.390
Goodnight, daddy.

18:22.977 --> 18:24.353
Goodnight.

18:48.210 --> 18:51.589
I wonder if Miss Ryan knows

18:48.210 --> 18:51.589
she didn't give us any homework.

18:51.631 --> 18:53.215
I better go back and check.

18:53.257 --> 18:55.051
No.

18:56.803 --> 18:58.554
Send her a postcard.

19:00.056 --> 19:02.016
Hey, guys, spread out.

19:04.393 --> 19:05.979
Here, Derek.

19:07.855 --> 19:10.066
It's all in the wrist.

19:14.403 --> 19:16.656
Way to go, Derek.

19:14.403 --> 19:16.656
You're two for two.

19:18.116 --> 19:20.994
- Sorry.

19:18.116 --> 19:20.994
- I'll get it.

19:22.453 --> 19:25.748
I thought your dad said

19:22.453 --> 19:25.748
you couldn't climb up there.

19:25.790 --> 19:29.502
I can if I want to.

19:25.790 --> 19:29.502
I'm a big girl.

19:29.543 --> 19:32.964
You threw it.

19:29.543 --> 19:32.964
Why don't you get it?

19:34.298 --> 19:36.634
I would..

19:36.676 --> 19:38.761
...but I can't take the chance.

Whatever you do,

don't look down.

Too late.

20:04.912 --> 20:08.833
Michelle, are you

20:04.912 --> 20:08.833
coming down or what?

20:08.875 --> 20:11.210
I can't. I'm too scared.

Hey, Denise.

20:16.632 --> 20:18.258
Where's Michelle?

20:16.632 --> 20:18.258
I haven't seen her.

20:19.426 --> 20:21.637
You're not looking high enough.

Holding on really tight.

20:30.312 --> 20:35.026
She climbed to the top, sir,

20:30.312 --> 20:35.026
and I believe she choked.

20:35.068 --> 20:37.653
Daddy, I can't get down.

20:35.068 --> 20:37.653
Come and get me.

20:37.695 --> 20:39.197
Honey, you can do this

20:37.695 --> 20:39.197
on your own.

20:39.238 --> 20:41.532
Just come back down

20:39.238 --> 20:41.532
the same way you went up.

20:41.574 --> 20:43.242
I can't. I'm sorry.

20:43.283 --> 20:45.161
I'll wear the hat.

20:43.283 --> 20:45.161
I won't buy lunch.

20:45.203 --> 20:47.830
I won't get a tattoo.

20:45.203 --> 20:47.830
Just get me down.

20:49.331 --> 20:53.086
Honey, did you hear me?

20:49.331 --> 20:53.086
I said you're a big girl, okay?

20:53.127 --> 20:56.463
- You can do this on your own.

- Are you sure?

20:56.505 --> 20:57.631
'I'm positive.'

"The only thing we have

20:59.633 --> 21:02.553
to fear is fear itself."

21:02.595 --> 21:06.306
I believe falling

21:02.595 --> 21:06.306
is also a consideration.

Michelle, honey,

21:08.017 --> 21:09.727
I know you can do this.

21:09.769 --> 21:11.979
I'm right behind you.

21:09.769 --> 21:11.979
I'm not gonna let you fall.

21:12.021 --> 21:13.898
Just come down slowly.

21:16.442 --> 21:18.694
Okay.

21:18.736 --> 21:21.321
Good. That's it.

21:18.736 --> 21:21.321
Now, it's just like a step now.

There's a,

21:21.363 --> 21:23.323
there's a metal pole there.

21:23.365 --> 21:25.826
'That's right. Easy now.'

21:25.868 --> 21:27.870
'Just step. That's good.'

21:27.912 --> 21:29.622
'It's like a ladder.'

21:31.249 --> 21:33.209
Michelle, you're doing

21:31.249 --> 21:33.209
this all by yourself.

21:33.251 --> 21:35.294

Thanks for helping me down,

21:55.689 --> 21:58.609

21:58.651 --> 22:00.236
You're welcome.

22:00.278 --> 22:01.695
And I kind of remember

22:00.278 --> 22:01.695
telling you

22:01.737 --> 22:03.447
not to climb up there

22:01.737 --> 22:03.447
in the first place.

22:03.489 --> 22:05.574
But you said

22:03.489 --> 22:05.574
I was a big girl.

22:05.616 --> 22:07.493
I thought I could

22:05.616 --> 22:07.493
decide for myself.

22:07.534 --> 22:09.954
Yeah, well,

22:07.534 --> 22:09.954
part of being a big girl is

22:09.996 --> 22:13.499
knowing whether what you're

22:09.996 --> 22:13.499
doing is dangerous or not.

22:13.540 --> 22:15.709
I didn't know that part.

22:15.751 --> 22:17.628
I think it's gonna take

22:15.751 --> 22:17.628
a little while for both of us

22:17.670 --> 22:19.964
to get used to you

22:17.670 --> 22:19.964
being a big girl.

22:20.006 --> 22:23.383
- We'll help each other.

22:20.006 --> 22:23.383
- It's a deal.

22:40.734 --> 22:42.486
Michelle, you-you didn't

22:40.734 --> 22:42.486
have to kiss me

22:42.528 --> 22:44.404
in front of all your friends.

22:44.446 --> 22:46.866
I know, but I wanted to.

22:46.907 --> 22:49.285
I'm a big girl.

22:46.907 --> 22:49.285
It was my decision.

22:51.037 --> 22:52.579
I can live with that.

22:59.753 --> 23:01.922
your backpack?

23:01.964 --> 23:03.716
So do you wanna drive home

23:01.964 --> 23:03.716
or should I?

23:03.757 --> 23:05.968

- You're gonna drive, huh?
