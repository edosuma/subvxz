The Amazing Race...

00:03.965 --> 00:06.275
<i>At the starting line
in Munich, Germany,</i>

00:06.379 --> 00:08.448
<i>teams got shocking news...</i>

00:08.551 --> 00:10.896
You can complete the challenges
on this first leg of the race

00:11.000 --> 00:12.655
in any order that you want to.

00:12.758 --> 00:15.551
- It's called the Scramble.

00:15.655 --> 00:17.965
<i>...learning that the stakes
were higher than ever.</i>

00:18.068 --> 00:22.310
There are
no non-elimination legs.

00:24.793 --> 00:27.655
<i>In the first ever Scramble,
military brothers</i>

00:27.758 --> 00:29.620
<i>Marcus and Michael
took an early lead...</i>

00:29.724 --> 00:32.310
You got it!

00:32.413 --> 00:34.172
Dude, I don't want
to be on this road.

00:34.275 --> 00:36.241
<i>...but saw it slip away.</i>

00:37.275 --> 00:40.862
<i>Dating couple Derek
and Claire sawed,</i>

00:40.965 --> 00:44.965
<i>smashed
and rolled their way to the top.</i>

00:45.068 --> 00:47.310
You are the first team
to arrive.

00:47.413 --> 00:49.758
- Oh, my God! Let's go!

00:49.862 --> 00:51.931
<i>
Meanwhile,
engaged couple Aastha</i>

00:52.034 --> 00:53.517
<i>- and Nina stumbled...</i>

00:53.620 --> 00:55.241
Why was that so hard?

00:55.344 --> 00:56.655
<i>...and couldn't recover.</i>

00:56.758 --> 00:58.724
I am sorry to tell you
that you are eliminated

00:58.827 --> 01:00.862
- from the race.
- That's okay.

01:00.965 --> 01:03.310
<i>This season,
teams will be checking</i>

01:03.413 --> 01:05.103
<i>out of the Pit Stop</i>

01:05.206 --> 01:07.689
<i>based on the order they arrived
in the previous leg.</i>

01:09.241 --> 01:13.068
<i>They'll depart in groups
every 15 minutes.</i>

01:19.275 --> 01:20.931
- Good luck, y'all.
- Let's go.

01:21.034 --> 01:22.413
<i>
We are leaving
in the first group.</i>

01:22.517 --> 01:24.241
- With the newlyweds...

01:24.344 --> 01:25.586
<i>and Team</i> Big Brother.

01:25.689 --> 01:26.931
I know
we both are very ecstatic,

01:27.034 --> 01:29.103
very excited
to be in this position.

01:29.206 --> 01:31.689
<i>
Feels good to get
a little bit of a head start.</i>

01:31.793 --> 01:32.793
Game on, baby.

01:32.896 --> 01:34.965
- Let's get it.
- Let's go, girl.

01:35.068 --> 01:36.310
-"Route Info."
-"Route Info.

01:36.413 --> 01:37.517
Drive to Innsbruck, Austria."

01:37.620 --> 01:40.068
All teams will now drive

01:40.172 --> 01:43.413
from Germany's third largest
city, Munich, 90 miles south...

01:45.448 --> 01:46.689
<i>...to Austria</i>

01:46.793 --> 01:49.103
and the Alpine gem of Innsbruck,

01:49.206 --> 01:51.620
famous for its spectacular
mountain views,

01:51.724 --> 01:53.206
impressive architecture,

01:53.310 --> 01:55.551
- and high on the hills...

01:55.655 --> 01:56.827
...yodeling.

01:56.931 --> 01:59.655
"Head into the Alps
to Gruünwalderhof

01:59.758 --> 02:01.172
to find your next clue."

02:01.275 --> 02:03.379
- Sick. Let's go.
- Let's go.

02:03.482 --> 02:04.931
Pull up the map
and start navigating.

02:05.034 --> 02:06.586
- This is our car.
- Okay.

02:06.689 --> 02:07.896
Should we ask someone?

02:08.000 --> 02:10.586
Okay. Give me those maps.

02:10.689 --> 02:13.034
<i>-
We've been married one year.
- One year.</i>

02:13.137 --> 02:14.965
<i>And have only known each
other two and a half years.</i>

02:15.068 --> 02:16.827
<i>- Yeah.
- So we're still getting
to know each other.</i>

02:16.931 --> 02:18.793
Let's go in here
and let's get some directions.

02:18.896 --> 02:21.241
<i>- We're already learning
things about each other.
- Yeah.</i>

02:21.344 --> 02:23.413
You know, like, I need
to give better directions, so...

02:23.517 --> 02:27.620
We got to go here--
Gruünwalderhof in Austria.

02:27.724 --> 02:29.517
And if we can get the
turn-by-turn directions, you...

02:29.620 --> 02:31.034
Yeah, the whole...

02:31.137 --> 02:33.068
Turn-by-turn would be better.
Probably might be better.

02:33.172 --> 02:36.275
- That's better for you.
That's not how I do things.
- Okay.

02:36.379 --> 02:38.137
- He didn't realize
how competitive I really am.
- Yeah.

02:38.241 --> 02:40.103
So he's learning that,
and that's great.

02:40.206 --> 02:42.862
- Yeah. My wife's a beast.

02:43.827 --> 02:45.275
Thank you. Thank you.

02:45.379 --> 02:48.206
Can you help us?
We're trying to get to Austria.

02:48.310 --> 02:50.068
- Excuse me. Are you from here?
- Are you from here?

02:50.172 --> 02:51.241
Do you know the area?

02:53.206 --> 02:55.344
So, you go the, uh...
It's called 8.

02:55.448 --> 02:57.310
- Um...
- The 8. I see it.

02:57.413 --> 02:59.413
- We're looking for...
- Gruünwalderhof.

02:59.517 --> 03:00.482
Is it far?

03:00.586 --> 03:02.103
- Yes.
- How many minutes?

03:02.206 --> 03:03.862
- A walk?
- No, no, we're driving.
We're driving.

03:03.965 --> 03:05.034
- No, we're in a car.
- You're in a car?

03:05.137 --> 03:06.413
Okay, ten minutes.

03:06.517 --> 03:08.275
- Oh, okay.
- Okay.

03:08.379 --> 03:10.034
Grab the Munich map.
So we are...

03:10.137 --> 03:11.896
We're right here.

03:12.000 --> 03:14.068
- And then you cross the border
to Austria.
- All right.

03:14.172 --> 03:17.482
- Then you need to go to, uh...?
-"Gruünderwaldenhof."

03:17.586 --> 03:20.275
- Stop it right now.

03:20.379 --> 03:23.137
Gruünwalderhof, it's ten minutes.

03:23.241 --> 03:25.034
- It's right there.
- Let's go.

04:22.068 --> 04:25.896
So we're headed to Austria,
but first we have to go to

04:26.000 --> 04:28.620
Gruünwalderhof
to find our next clue.

04:28.724 --> 04:30.827
Going to Austria.

04:30.931 --> 04:32.517
"Gruünderwaldenhof."

04:32.620 --> 04:35.172
It's okay. We still got out
of there before the other teams.

04:36.068 --> 04:36.965
"Route Info."

04:37.068 --> 04:39.000
"Drive to Innsbruck, Austria."

04:39.103 --> 04:40.931
"Head into the Alps
to Gruünwalderhof."

04:41.034 --> 04:42.275
"To find your next clue."

04:42.379 --> 04:44.448
- Let's go.

04:44.551 --> 04:46.689
We got to go to the car.

04:46.793 --> 04:49.206
- Why did we go this way?
-'Cause the cars are here.

04:49.310 --> 04:51.000
Quite honestly,
I'm looking for a new partner.

04:51.103 --> 04:52.482
I'm willing to trade Tim.

04:52.586 --> 04:53.896
It's 'cause nobody wanted
to do it with him.

04:56.551 --> 04:57.827
No. We're having a great time.

04:57.931 --> 04:59.448
- This is us right here.
- Yeah.

04:59.551 --> 05:01.517
<i>
We just want to keep improving,</i>

05:01.620 --> 05:04.413
<i>but part... to improve,
we need to clean things up.</i>

05:04.517 --> 05:06.275
<i>
What we have
to clean up the most,</i>

05:06.379 --> 05:07.827
<i>I think, would probably be
the navigation.</i>

05:07.931 --> 05:09.275
<i>If we, if we clean up
the navigation</i>

05:09.379 --> 05:10.655
<i>and just figure it out
more clearly, I think...</i>

05:10.758 --> 05:12.931
<i>I think
we would be completely fine.</i>

05:13.034 --> 05:15.344
- Marcus, we got maps in here.
- Okay.

05:15.448 --> 05:18.206
- Do you want to go with them
and start looking together?
- Yeah.

05:18.310 --> 05:19.896
We're going to take 8 south.

05:20.000 --> 05:21.413
<i>We're leaving in the second
group with Tim and Rex.</i>

05:21.517 --> 05:22.827
<i>
I like Team T-Rex.</i>

05:22.931 --> 05:25.068
<i>They're loud
and they, and they laugh,</i>

05:25.172 --> 05:26.965
<i>and it's an energy
I like to be around.</i>

05:27.068 --> 05:28.862
I'm glad that we're not
leaving in the last group,

05:28.965 --> 05:30.413
but I'd much rather be leaving

05:30.517 --> 05:31.827
- in the first group.
- In the first group. Of course.

05:31.931 --> 05:33.206
- We're following you guys.
- All right.

05:33.310 --> 05:34.482
- So we're gonna follow you.
- Let's go, fellas.

05:34.586 --> 05:35.655
<i>
Things I know I would like</i>

05:35.758 --> 05:36.655
<i>to clean up for this leg is,</i>

05:36.758 --> 05:38.206
I'm pretty confident in skill,

05:38.310 --> 05:39.896
like, using a map to navigate.

05:40.000 --> 05:41.620
<i>Last leg, I might have kind of</i>

05:41.724 --> 05:44.275
<i>got ahead of myself, so I need
to be a little bit more patient.</i>

05:44.379 --> 05:46.034
- We're going to 8,
right, Marcus?
- Yup.

05:46.137 --> 05:47.896
Let's work smarter,
not harder, Dad.

05:48.000 --> 05:49.241
I don't know how to read a map.

05:49.344 --> 05:50.793
I understand,
but we can follow them.

05:50.896 --> 05:53.310
If we follow them,
we're behind them, so...

05:53.413 --> 05:55.206
- Just find someone
to help us, please.
- All right.

05:55.310 --> 05:57.172
Should we go talk to Jamaica?

05:57.275 --> 05:59.724
- Gruünwalderhof...
Ah, ja, okay, okay.
- Yeah...

05:59.827 --> 06:02.448
- 105 kilometers. Two hours.
- Okay.

06:02.551 --> 06:04.379
Oh, wait.
They're getting directions.

06:04.482 --> 06:05.896
All the way down on 8.

06:06.000 --> 06:07.379
Dad, please write that legibly.

06:07.482 --> 06:08.793
- Okay.
- I can't read that.

06:08.896 --> 06:11.862
A-13. Thank you.
Come on, Dad.

06:12.896 --> 06:14.379
- Danke.
- Thank you very much.

06:14.482 --> 06:16.241
That is so frustrating.

06:16.344 --> 06:18.896
How did everyone leave so fast?

06:19.896 --> 06:22.275
- Don't worry
about everyone else.
- I know.

06:22.379 --> 06:23.379
- We're taking A8, right?
- Yeah.

06:23.482 --> 06:25.275
- Okay.
- Awesome.

06:25.379 --> 06:28.724
- We did it right the first
time... on the last leg.
- Yes.

06:28.827 --> 06:30.896
- And we just have
to rinse and repeat.
- Yeah.

06:31.000 --> 06:33.448
You know, it's kind of difficult
using the compass in the car

06:33.551 --> 06:36.206
because, you know,
streets kind of bend.

06:36.310 --> 06:37.689
They ebb and they flow.

06:37.793 --> 06:39.310
And we just want to make sure
that we're not going

06:39.413 --> 06:41.862
the opposite direction
of where we want to go.

06:42.655 --> 06:44.482
- Go, go, go!
- Love and light.

06:44.586 --> 06:46.103
-"Drive to Innsbruck, Austria."

06:46.206 --> 06:47.103
Come on, baby.

06:47.206 --> 06:48.241
Let's go. I'll lead you

06:48.344 --> 06:49.724
- onto the highway.
- All right.

06:49.827 --> 06:51.724
- Will, I'm going
to try and follow them.
- Okay.

06:51.827 --> 06:52.758
Oh, we got some followers
in the house.

06:52.862 --> 06:53.827
Oh, they're gonna follow you?

06:53.931 --> 06:55.344
- Yeah.
- That's risky.

06:58.275 --> 07:01.724
I have just found the exit
that we need

07:01.827 --> 07:03.034
for where we're going
once we get to Innsbruck.

07:03.137 --> 07:05.103
Love it.

07:05.206 --> 07:07.379
- This is actually
really gorgeous.
- Yeah.

07:08.413 --> 07:10.000
Somehow those guys

07:10.103 --> 07:11.448
found out exactly where
we needed to be. Military guys

07:11.551 --> 07:13.517
<i>know their directions.
These guys are awesome.</i>

07:13.620 --> 07:14.896
<i>We're going to follow them,
and then,</i>

07:15.000 --> 07:16.000
<i>from there,
we're going to see where we go.</i>

07:16.103 --> 07:17.137
The Group One had

07:17.241 --> 07:18.551
a 15-minute head start.

07:18.655 --> 07:20.344
I'm hoping

07:20.448 --> 07:25.344
<i>all three teams aren't
as comfortable with a map,</i>

07:25.448 --> 07:29.862
and maybe we can make up
some time on... on the road.

07:29.965 --> 07:31.517
You see Rex driving
with two hands. He's impatient.

07:31.620 --> 07:34.137
Very defensive driver.

07:34.241 --> 07:36.689
Not an aggressive driver at all.

07:36.793 --> 07:38.724
That's the new me-- patient.

07:38.827 --> 07:40.379
- This is the new Rex?
- The new Rex.

07:40.482 --> 07:41.965
Is this all the time,
or is this just in Europe?

07:42.068 --> 07:43.448
- No, just in Europe.
- Okay.

07:43.551 --> 07:45.689
- When I get back home, it's on.

07:47.655 --> 07:50.413
- Look at this.
-
Oh, my God, that's gorgeous.

07:50.517 --> 07:53.586
- Beautiful.
: That's crazy!
- Wow.

07:53.689 --> 07:56.896
<i>
This race means a lot
to us because</i>

07:57.000 --> 08:00.689
- we will be starting
our family right after...

08:00.793 --> 08:02.206
<i>...after the race.</i>

08:02.310 --> 08:03.620
<i>We even have
his nickname picked out.</i>

08:03.724 --> 08:05.379
<i>- Boom-Boom.
- His name is Boom-Boom!</i>

08:05.482 --> 08:07.448
- We're racing for Boom-Boom.
- Yes.

08:08.724 --> 08:10.862
- Man, this is amazing.
- It really is.

08:10.965 --> 08:12.793
- Yeah.
- Wow.

08:16.344 --> 08:18.413
- Excuse me.
- Could you help us?

08:18.517 --> 08:20.241
Gruünwalderhof?
Do you know where that is?

08:20.344 --> 08:24.310
Uh, no. But this is in...

08:24.413 --> 08:27.137
Not in Germany.

08:27.241 --> 08:28.551
This is in Austria?

08:28.655 --> 08:30.310
- Yes.
- Okay.

08:30.413 --> 08:33.965
- That would make sense.
- That would make sense.

08:36.689 --> 08:38.206
<i>
We were looking</i>

08:38.310 --> 08:40.689
for a location in Munich,
but it's actually in Austria.

08:40.793 --> 08:43.103
<i>Hoping that some other teams
are lost right now.</i>

08:43.206 --> 08:45.965
Rookie mistake.

08:52.655 --> 08:57.034
So we're in for a longer
road trip than we thought.

08:57.137 --> 08:59.103
- Left on Belgradstrasse?
- Yes.

08:59.206 --> 09:00.310
Thank you for helping us out.

09:00.413 --> 09:03.068
- We're fine.
- We're okay.

09:03.172 --> 09:04.068
Other people have
to be lost, right?

09:05.482 --> 09:07.482
You feel confident
about where we're going?

09:07.586 --> 09:10.000
- Yes.
- We stopped a local
and found out

09:10.103 --> 09:12.448
we are on the right street
in the wrong city.

09:12.551 --> 09:14.103
- And...
- No, country, like...

09:14.206 --> 09:17.034
- And the wrong country.
- Like...

09:17.137 --> 09:19.655
It sucks that there has been
a little bit of a mix-up, but

09:19.758 --> 09:21.310
I'm just happy
we caught it in enough time.

09:21.413 --> 09:23.172
The last group didn't even start
until 8:30,

09:23.275 --> 09:24.965
so people can't be
too far ahead.

09:30.931 --> 09:32.448
<i>
Wow.</i>

09:33.517 --> 09:36.103
- This might be it.
- Yeah.

09:36.206 --> 09:38.551
- Claire, we're the first ones here.
- Go left.

09:38.655 --> 09:40.862
So we just saw Derek and Claire.
They're in front of us.

09:40.965 --> 09:42.586
So it look like
we made up to Group One.

09:42.689 --> 09:44.689
- All right, ready?
- Rip 'em.

09:45.724 --> 09:47.448
Oh, there's a bunch
of cars there.

09:47.551 --> 09:49.103
<i>
Dude, we caught up.</i>

09:49.206 --> 09:50.896
"Who wants to call in the cows?"

09:57.517 --> 09:59.482
The distinctive sound
of a yodel.

10:01.827 --> 10:05.482
A type of singing that requires
rapid pitch changes of notes...

10:07.379 --> 10:09.448
...generated deep
in the chest...

10:13.137 --> 10:14.965
...combined with falsetto.

10:20.620 --> 10:22.724
Listening to teams complete
this Roadblock

10:22.827 --> 10:24.724
might be painful to listen to,

10:24.827 --> 10:27.655
but if they can find perfect
pitch like these gentlemen,

10:27.758 --> 10:29.724
they'll be rewarded with a clue.

10:32.137 --> 10:33.344
- Should I call in the cows?
- Yeah, Claire's gonna call in

10:33.448 --> 10:34.620
- the cows.
- Okay.

10:34.724 --> 10:36.034
- You're doing it, right?
- Cool, I'll do it.

10:36.137 --> 10:37.275
All right,
Michael's doing the Roadblock.

10:37.379 --> 10:39.034
I'm gonna call in the cows, man.

10:41.517 --> 10:42.551

At the time, we were, you know,
fresh immigrants in America.

<i>My parents immigrated

14:25.931 --> 14:28.034

not confident about that?

14:29.655 --> 14:30.862
:
Are you okay?

14:32.620 --> 14:36.034
This journey for us is a journey
of discovery about one another.

14:36.137 --> 14:39.068
<i>Also, I found out it's...
I'm learning a lot about myself.</i>

14:39.172 --> 14:40.413
<i>
Yeah. A lot of personal growth.</i>

14:40.517 --> 14:42.482
She is really go-with-the-flow.

14:42.586 --> 14:46.206
And I might actually be a little
uptight and controlling.

14:46.310 --> 14:48.310
- I thought I was normal,
but...
- Just a little, but it's okay.

14:48.413 --> 14:49.862
It's good. It's a good balance.

14:49.965 --> 14:53.724

<i>And that's why
I wear my hair this way,</i>

15:18.655 --> 15:21.551

15:21.655 --> 15:22.793
more of a merfairy.

15:22.896 --> 15:24.448

who I am on the inside.

29:16.206 --> 29:17.965
- Okay.
- Okay?

29:18.068 --> 29:20.103
- And this side's
the yellow one, okay?
- Okay.

29:20.206 --> 29:21.896
Here are the letters.
You see them?

29:22.000 --> 29:24.241
- Yeah, I see FA, AC.
- FA, uh-huh, AC.

29:24.344 --> 29:26.586
- BD.
- AC.

29:26.689 --> 29:31.379
- Okay, like one-two,
three-four.

29:31.482 --> 29:35.793
Five-six, seven-eight.
And go back.

29:39.827 --> 29:41.241
All of that you just did were...

29:41.344 --> 29:42.724
- That's the first part.
- Okay.

29:42.827 --> 29:44.206
-'Cause there's two of 'em,
Marcus.
- So...

29:44.310 --> 29:45.586
- I'm the blue. Anything in blue.
- Watch your color.

29:45.689 --> 29:47.241
- Anything in blue? Okay.
- Mm-hmm. Yes.

29:47.344 --> 29:48.551
- I got it.
- You got it.

29:48.655 --> 29:49.931
I understand now.

29:50.034 --> 29:52.620
It was about ten bells
that we'd have

29:52.724 --> 29:55.137
<i>to alternate playing either one
or two bells.</i>

29:55.241 --> 29:57.517
<i>Those bells were different sizes</i>

29:57.620 --> 30:00.137
<i>so they had a different chime,
a sound, and a tone.</i>

30:00.241 --> 30:01.620
We, both of us,
have to go back and forth.

30:15.724 --> 30:17.965
- You're learning fast.
- Okay. One more time.

30:28.862 --> 30:31.620
Yeah? Yeah?

30:31.724 --> 30:34.793
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

30:37.000 --> 30:38.586
Yo-ho-ho-hui.

30:38.689 --> 30:40.793
- Yo-ho-ho-hui.
- Great.

30:43.206 --> 30:45.344
I feel like
I'm letting Derek down.

30:45.448 --> 30:46.758
-"Marktplatz."
- Okay.

30:46.862 --> 30:48.206
- Sweet. Let's do it.
- Okay.

30:48.310 --> 30:50.448
- Abby, you crushed that.
You crushed it.
- Whee!

30:50.551 --> 30:54.034
- I think we jumped, like, what,
three people at least?
- Yeah.

30:57.413 --> 30:58.896

Detour.</i>

30:59.000 --> 31:01.448
- Partner Swingin'!
- Hey!

31:01.551 --> 31:03.275
- All right, let's figure out
where we're going.
- All right.

31:03.379 --> 31:04.793
"Make your way to Annasaäule."

31:04.896 --> 31:06.137
- Let's go faster.
- Okay.

31:06.241 --> 31:07.344
'Cause we don't want
anyone catching up.

31:16.310 --> 31:17.517
Instructors?

31:17.620 --> 31:19.482
- You guys dance instructors?
- You!

31:21.241 --> 31:22.586
- Let's watch it.
- Watch it?

31:22.689 --> 31:23.896
Okay, yeah, sure.

31:33.413 --> 31:34.620
I guess you're gonna
teach us that, right?

31:34.724 --> 31:36.655
Yeah, okay.

31:38.034 --> 31:39.862
- Detour. Do you want to dance?
- I think so.

31:39.965 --> 31:41.482
Feel like dancing is a little
easier. We're gonna dance.

31:41.586 --> 31:43.551
What-what am I doing
with my hands? Like... Okay.

31:43.655 --> 31:46.620
My hand is...
one, two, three, four.

31:46.724 --> 31:48.448
One, two, three, four.

31:48.551 --> 31:49.896
Don't tire yourself.

31:50.000 --> 31:51.379
It's good.
We're-we're here already.

31:51.482 --> 31:53.379
- I hear music.
- I hear music.

31:53.482 --> 31:54.586
Yes. That's it.

31:54.689 --> 31:56.344
I choose you.

31:56.448 --> 31:58.275
- Yay.
<i>♪ La, la-la-la-la, la-la.♪</i>

31:59.310 --> 32:01.689
- Oh. Okay.
- You got to spin me
and do your move.

32:01.793 --> 32:03.310
- All right, all right.
- This is gonna be interesting

32:03.413 --> 32:05.413
-'cause we're seven inches
apart.

32:06.689 --> 32:09.275
It's hard to be five-seven
twirling a six-two queen.

32:09.379 --> 32:11.034
- I'm just... Let's be for real.
Like, I...
- I know.

32:11.137 --> 32:12.620
That's some big circles
I had to do with my arm.

32:12.724 --> 32:14.034
I was concerned
about one of the twirl...

32:14.137 --> 32:15.620
<i>I was concerned
about some of those twirls</i>

32:15.724 --> 32:17.482
<i>'cause he had to turn me.

32:17.586 --> 32:19.862
- We did it, though.

32:19.965 --> 32:21.172
- We did it.
- You did it
with that little finger.

32:21.275 --> 32:22.275
You put that finger up,
and I was like,

32:22.379 --> 32:23.689
"Ooh, let me get that, girl."

32:23.793 --> 32:24.965
- Six, seven.
- That was a lot better.

32:25.068 --> 32:27.965
I'm hoping
that when we get there,

32:28.068 --> 32:29.310
we see other teams there.

32:29.413 --> 32:30.862
That would be a great sign of,

32:30.965 --> 32:32.448
we're still in this thing.

32:45.862 --> 32:47.275

Di-riddle, dulio.

32:49.517 --> 32:51.000

<i>We've had such a fall,</i>

32:56.000 --> 32:57.724

only because of me.

33:06.206 --> 33:08.586
For the love of God.

33:08.689 --> 33:10.689

- How could you possibly

39:44.034 --> 39:45.068

- Very good. Very good.

39:45.172 --> 39:46.655

with the bells.

threw me off a little bit.

50:40.862 --> 50:42.689
Maybe you guys should
tell them where they are.

50:42.793 --> 50:44.931
- Team number four.
- Four.
- Four? Okay.

50:45.034 --> 50:46.724
- Oh, my God. Amazing.

50:46.827 --> 50:48.206
- Amazing.
- Four. We're team four.

50:52.689 --> 50:54.482
Hello, Austria!

50:54.586 --> 50:56.137
Let's go.

50:56.241 --> 50:58.103
- We got this.
- Hmm.

51:06.793 --> 51:07.965
Can we go try it?

51:08.068 --> 51:09.241
- Sure.
- Okay.

51:20.862 --> 51:22.137
Did they get it?

51:22.241 --> 51:23.551
Congratulations.

51:23.655 --> 51:24.655
Yeah!

51:24.758 --> 51:26.896
Thank you!
Thank you, guys!

51:29.103 --> 51:30.620
- This is us right here.
- Yeah.

51:31.689 --> 51:33.172
Detour. Which one
do you want to choose?

51:33.275 --> 51:34.724
Do you want to play the music,
or do you want to dance?

51:34.827 --> 51:36.551
The-- We're with
a bunch of dancers.

51:36.655 --> 51:38.620
- They're gonna be
way better than us.
- Okay. Yeah, let's do the bells.

51:44.793 --> 51:46.275
- All right, let's do it,
baby. We got this.
- All right.

51:46.379 --> 51:47.655
1 Stiftgasse.

51:47.758 --> 51:48.896
- It's right here, Rex.
- Got it.

51:49.000 --> 51:50.241
I hear 'em.

51:50.344 --> 51:51.655
- Yeah.
- Hi. Was it easy?

51:51.758 --> 51:52.827
We're working on it.

51:52.931 --> 51:54.862
You got it. Thank you so much.

51:54.965 --> 51:56.758
- Hello.
- Hello.

51:56.862 --> 51:59.655
- Okay, so...
- Hello. Thank you.
Good to have you today.

51:59.758 --> 52:01.862
- Okay, you got this, baby.
- You got this.

52:02.896 --> 52:03.965
- Okay? All right.
- Yeah, we got this.

52:04.068 --> 52:05.275
- You ready?
- Yes.

52:27.931 --> 52:29.896
Okay. Let's do it again, baby.
We got this.

52:30.000 --> 52:32.000
What are we doing,
what are we doing wrong, or...?

52:32.103 --> 52:33.310
I think
you missed that one.

52:33.413 --> 52:34.655
Which one did I miss?

52:34.758 --> 52:35.655
Yeah, it was this one.
This one. CE.

52:35.758 --> 52:36.862
I missed CE. Okay.

52:36.965 --> 52:39.241
Hold on, hold on.
Let-let me say it. Okay.

52:39.344 --> 52:41.000
I thank the universe
for all that is good.

52:41.103 --> 52:43.517
Here we go. Richard.
All right. Here we go.

52:43.620 --> 52:45.620
- I've got the "G."

52:45.724 --> 52:47.068
- "C." Little "F."
- Then I have FA and CF.

52:47.172 --> 52:48.068
- Ready?
- Yeah.

52:50.586 --> 52:52.310
We just got
to really pay attention.

52:52.413 --> 52:54.206
:

52:54.310 --> 52:55.793
Let's go.

52:55.896 --> 52:57.793
- Had enough with the dancing?
- No. I'll dance some more.

52:57.896 --> 52:59.310
- Give me all the dancing.
- You love it, huh?

52:59.413 --> 53:00.827
- Yes.
- Dancing is too much fun, yeah.

53:00.931 --> 53:03.172
Well, I am pleased to tell you
that after the second leg

53:03.275 --> 53:05.482
of <i>The Amazing Race,</i>
you're the fifth team to arrive.

53:06.517 --> 53:09.034
Yes. Yes. Let's go.

53:09.137 --> 53:10.310
- Does that feel good?
- Yes, it feels great, Phil.

53:10.413 --> 53:11.586
- Oh, my God, it feels amazing.
- Yeah.

53:26.344 --> 53:28.137
Oh. No?

53:28.241 --> 53:29.482
- Sorry, guys.
- Oh.

53:29.586 --> 53:31.862
This is
a very perfect performance.

53:31.965 --> 53:35.793
- Yeah!

53:35.896 --> 53:37.172
All right, I got it.

53:38.206 --> 53:39.724
- We did it.
- Good job.

53:39.827 --> 53:41.344
<i>- Detour.
- Detour.</i>

53:41.448 --> 53:42.758
- We're doing Partner Swing.
- Partner Swing.

53:42.862 --> 53:44.379
- All right.
- Partner Swing it is.

53:44.482 --> 53:46.896
- This way, babe!
- Go, go, go, go, go, go,
go, go, go! Come on!

53:47.000 --> 53:48.758
<i>
Aubrey's the best at dancing,</i>

53:48.862 --> 53:50.517
<i>so I'm not worried
about it one bit.</i>

53:56.482 --> 53:58.620
- Eight.
- Oh, my God.

53:58.724 --> 54:01.344
This was near perfect
Austrian style.

54:01.448 --> 54:04.172
- Oh. Thank you.
- Come to me. This is for you.

54:04.275 --> 54:05.827
- Thank you!

54:05.931 --> 54:08.655
<i>
We dance salsa and bachata,</i>

54:08.758 --> 54:10.344
<i>so the partnering will be good.</i>

54:10.448 --> 54:11.620
- Hey.
- Listen to me.

54:11.724 --> 54:13.344
Yes.

54:13.448 --> 54:14.689
Zen.

54:32.517 --> 54:34.344
- Congratulations.
- Oh, God.
- Yes.

54:39.310 --> 54:41.448
Thank you. Bless you.

54:42.965 --> 54:44.241
I don't care.
Let's not worry about it.

54:44.344 --> 54:45.827
- Okay, are you ready? Well...
- Pay attention.

54:45.931 --> 54:47.586
Go GB.

54:47.689 --> 54:50.103
<i>
Rex is a coach,
so he knows how to stay calm.</i>

54:50.206 --> 54:51.931
Little "C." E-F.

54:52.034 --> 54:53.931
<i>I think it was brilliant
coaching on my part.</i>

54:54.034 --> 54:56.586
<i>- There's no way...
there's no two ways about it.</i>

54:56.689 --> 54:59.206
We got this. All right, buddy.

55:03.517 --> 55:06.448
Keep going, Dave.

55:09.724 --> 55:11.724
- Ha!
- Ha!

55:11.827 --> 55:13.620
It's a great show.
It's near Austrian style.

55:13.724 --> 55:15.931
- Yes!
- Yeah!

55:16.034 --> 55:17.137
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
- Good luck.

55:17.241 --> 55:18.413
- Thank you. Thank you.
- You are welcome.

55:18.517 --> 55:19.724
Bye, choreographer.

55:21.448 --> 55:23.379
Hey.

55:23.482 --> 55:25.517
I mean, the whole time
you've been here, your...

55:25.620 --> 55:27.551
I don't think I've ever seen
a bigger smile anywhere.

55:27.655 --> 55:30.448
I think it's the most
sore muscle on my body.

55:30.551 --> 55:31.827
You are team number six.

55:31.931 --> 55:34.931
Yeah. Moving up.

55:35.034 --> 55:36.689
- Congratulations, guys.
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you, Phil.

55:36.793 --> 55:38.000
- We're gonna get this.
- All right.

55:38.103 --> 55:39.655
Hit it, sir!

55:56.724 --> 55:59.137
All right. We're close.

55:59.241 --> 56:01.379
We're close. We've already
got past the first row.

56:01.482 --> 56:02.827
We're ready. Come on.

56:04.344 --> 56:06.482
We got a "G."

56:08.206 --> 56:09.931
Okay. We're good.
We are close.

56:16.241 --> 56:18.172
Tim, deep breath.
All right, here we go.

56:25.620 --> 56:27.689
- Oh, we're so close, buddy.
We are getting it.

56:27.793 --> 56:29.689
- There ain't no chance in hell
we're-we're gonna win this.
- Yes...

56:31.241 --> 56:32.689
Last one.

56:33.827 --> 56:35.379
- Dancing.
- We're dancing.

56:35.482 --> 56:37.413
It's not over till it's over.
It's not over till it's over.

56:37.517 --> 56:40.000
<i>We knew we needed to get it,
and we needed to get it quick.</i>

56:40.103 --> 56:41.586
<i>
Like, quick.</i>

56:41.689 --> 56:44.586
If there's anybody that can
pick up and do it, it is us.

56:44.689 --> 56:46.137
We're about
to learn a partner dance.

56:46.241 --> 56:47.655
- This is right
in our wheelhouse.
- Yup.

56:53.931 --> 56:55.862
I'm so proud of you.

56:55.965 --> 56:57.724
Welcome to Innsbruck, Austria.

56:57.827 --> 56:59.655
- Thank you so much.
- Oh.

56:59.758 --> 57:01.551
Did you ever imagine that

57:01.655 --> 57:05.655
you would be in Austria in
Innsbruck as sisters doing this?

57:05.758 --> 57:07.758
Never. I never imagined
I had a sister.

57:07.862 --> 57:08.965
I know.

57:09.068 --> 57:10.172
Yeah, we're here.

57:10.275 --> 57:12.068
- Oh, my God.
- And now here they are

57:12.172 --> 57:13.068
- in Innsbruck, in Austria.
- Now we're racing
around the world together.

57:13.172 --> 57:14.689
They're racing around the world.

57:14.793 --> 57:16.758
And I'm pleased to tell you
that you are the seventh team

57:16.862 --> 57:18.275
- to arrive.
- Oh, thank God.
- We're in the back.

57:18.379 --> 57:22.103
Which means that you get to race
another leg of this race.

57:22.206 --> 57:24.620
- Yes. Another night together.

57:24.724 --> 57:26.896
It's more than just
the race days for us.

57:27.000 --> 57:29.896
It's the time in between,
the-the moments where

57:30.000 --> 57:32.827
we can sit down
and talk about the hardships

57:32.931 --> 57:34.655
we may have experienced.

57:34.758 --> 57:36.689
<i>
There's so much about you
that I don't know</i>

57:36.793 --> 57:39.344
<i>and so much about your life
that I don't know.</i>

57:39.448 --> 57:42.620
- This is why we can't
come in seventh next leg.

57:44.344 --> 57:47.517
- We have
to have more time together.

57:47.620 --> 57:49.241
Turn around.
There's a team there.

57:51.379 --> 57:53.517
Rich and Dom, you are
the eighth team to arrive.

57:53.620 --> 57:55.413
However, the clue clearly states

57:55.517 --> 57:58.137
that you need to arrive
at the mat with your hat.

57:58.241 --> 57:59.724
"You must properly wear
the provided wardrobe

57:59.827 --> 58:01.413
for the rest of this leg."

58:01.517 --> 58:04.862
So I need you to go and get your
hat before I can check you in.

58:04.965 --> 58:06.862
I think it fell off
while we were running.

58:06.965 --> 58:09.379
- I don't know where it is
in the streets.
- Okay.

58:09.482 --> 58:11.758
I think you're going to need
to go back and check.

58:14.896 --> 58:17.172
What? You know what?
Where's, where's the car?

58:17.275 --> 58:18.517
The car is
in the parking garage.

58:18.620 --> 58:20.241
I think it might be in the car.

58:27.724 --> 58:29.275
<i>I know you have not
been wearing the hat</i>

58:29.379 --> 58:31.275
- for a while.
- I think it's in the car.

58:31.379 --> 58:34.551
It's in the car.
It's in the car.

58:34.655 --> 58:36.896
:
It's in the car.
It's in the car.

58:37.000 --> 58:39.551
- We got
to remember our way back here.
- Yeah. Come on.

58:41.586 --> 58:43.931
- Okay, great,
and you can drop your bags.
- Oh.

58:44.034 --> 58:47.310
- We meet again, Phil.
- Yes, indeed.
- Oh, man.

58:47.413 --> 58:49.206
And the question is,
where are you at?

58:49.310 --> 58:50.586
We have no idea.

58:50.689 --> 58:52.034
You are team number eight,

58:52.137 --> 58:54.344
- and you are still in the race.
- Yes.

58:56.172 --> 58:57.965
- Congratulations, guys.
- Thank you so much, Phil.

58:58.068 --> 58:59.103
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

59:01.586 --> 59:03.965
-  You got it. Don't rush.
- Let's go.

59:09.482 --> 59:11.379
<i>
We always say dance is
our stress relief.</i>

59:11.482 --> 59:14.103
<i>For those 12 eight counts
that we did, I didn't feel</i>

59:14.206 --> 59:15.275
- any pressure.
I was just like...
- Yeah.

59:15.379 --> 59:16.551
We were just doing it,
having fun.

59:18.137 --> 59:20.137
Got it.

59:30.482 --> 59:31.793
It's near perfect.

59:31.896 --> 59:33.482
It's near Austrian style.
You are welcome.

59:33.586 --> 59:36.137
- Okay, it's for you.

59:36.241 --> 59:38.379
- Hey, bravo.
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you.

59:50.965 --> 59:54.034
Yeah...!

59:54.137 --> 59:56.344
- Yeah!
- Congratulations.

59:56.448 --> 59:58.206
Thank you for the story, brother.

59:58.310 --> 1:00:00.551
- Thank you. Thank you.
- Thank you, sir. Thank you.

1:00:00.655 --> 1:00:02.965
- All the best.
- Thank you. Thank you.

1:00:03.068 --> 1:00:05.068
- All right.

1:00:09.034 --> 1:00:11.034
Which way?

1:00:13.000 --> 1:00:14.827
I think it's this way, right?

1:00:14.931 --> 1:00:17.310
We don't give up.

1:00:17.413 --> 1:00:19.206
- Let's go. Let's go. Come on.
- All right.

1:00:19.310 --> 1:00:21.827
Is this it? I got it. I got it.

1:00:21.931 --> 1:00:24.310
I got it in my hand.
I have it in my hand. Come on.

1:00:24.413 --> 1:00:26.137
Come on, girl.

1:00:26.241 --> 1:00:28.551
Okay. Where? To the right?

1:00:28.655 --> 1:00:31.172
It's us and the cheerleaders,
bud. Let's do it.

1:00:31.275 --> 1:00:34.758
- You got to go, buddy.
- Yeah. Focus.

1:00:34.862 --> 1:00:37.862
We... we can't quit.

1:00:37.965 --> 1:00:39.827
It's just pain.

1:00:41.137 --> 1:00:42.655
Race it out.

1:00:42.758 --> 1:00:46.482
- We got to do our thing.
- You never know.

1:00:51.172 --> 1:00:54.551
It's right here. Right here!

1:00:54.655 --> 1:00:56.344
I see it, I think.

1:00:56.448 --> 1:00:58.448
- Nope.
- Yeah. Right here.

1:01:09.551 --> 1:01:11.655
Hold your heads high.

1:01:11.758 --> 1:01:14.586
Rich and Dom,
you are still in the race.

1:01:14.689 --> 1:01:16.758
You are team number nine.

1:01:16.862 --> 1:01:19.000
There are still two more teams
that have to arrive.

1:01:19.103 --> 1:01:20.758
And here's one
of them right now.

1:01:22.896 --> 1:01:25.758
- Ooh.
- Well, as you know,

1:01:25.862 --> 1:01:28.379
there are no second chances
on this race.

1:01:28.482 --> 1:01:30.689
If you arrive last,
you are eliminated.

1:01:31.724 --> 1:01:34.517
And I'm pleased to tell you
that you are not last.

1:01:34.620 --> 1:01:36.689
You are not eliminated.

1:01:37.724 --> 1:01:39.965
And you are still in the race.

1:01:45.862 --> 1:01:47.241
Quinton, I see that you've...

1:01:47.344 --> 1:01:49.000
you've got all this pent-up
emotion right now.

1:01:49.103 --> 1:01:51.241
You were thinking
your race was gone, huh?

1:01:51.344 --> 1:01:53.068
Yeah, I was the one
kind of driving,

1:01:53.172 --> 1:01:54.517
so I felt like all the little

1:01:54.620 --> 1:01:56.137
stupid mistakes
that were happening...

1:01:56.241 --> 1:01:58.137
They're natural,
but I feel like every...

1:01:58.241 --> 1:01:59.689
every turn counts,
every second counts,

1:01:59.793 --> 1:02:01.172
every minute counts
in this race.

1:02:01.275 --> 1:02:03.206
That's right. And that's what
can happen in this race.

1:02:03.310 --> 1:02:04.551
It's very humbling.

1:02:04.655 --> 1:02:06.413
- Yes.
- One minute, you're a winner,

1:02:06.517 --> 1:02:08.310
you're going home
with the prize, and the next...

1:02:08.413 --> 1:02:11.172
the next minute, you're out and
you wonder how it all happened.

1:02:11.275 --> 1:02:14.206
We lucked out getting dance
challenges, that's for sure.

1:02:20.482 --> 1:02:23.206
- Oh, guys.
- He's got that look.
He's got that look.

1:02:23.310 --> 1:02:25.413
Guys, guys, guys,
you want to drop your bags?

1:02:27.000 --> 1:02:29.241
Uh, Tim and Rex, I am really
sorry to tell you

1:02:29.344 --> 1:02:32.241
that you are officially
the last team to arrive,

1:02:32.344 --> 1:02:34.586
and I have to eliminate you
from the race.

1:02:34.689 --> 1:02:36.310
- All right. That's good.
- All right.

1:02:36.413 --> 1:02:38.103
- Thanks, Phil.
- Gonna miss you guys.

1:02:38.206 --> 1:02:40.586
I know you gave it
absolutely everything.

1:02:40.689 --> 1:02:43.206
- Yeah. I mean, look,
I lost 50 pounds for this.

1:02:43.310 --> 1:02:45.620
- Yeah.
- Just to try
to hang in there, but, man,

1:02:45.724 --> 1:02:49.482
I never thought that...
we should have probably danced.

1:02:49.586 --> 1:02:51.482
I think we found a weakness
of ours might be music.

1:02:51.586 --> 1:02:53.413
Our-our music stuff is...

1:02:53.517 --> 1:02:54.965
And we live in Music City,

1:02:55.068 --> 1:02:57.413
- so we did not represent
Music City very well.
- No.

1:02:57.517 --> 1:03:00.241
You know, look,
we're going to be just blasted

1:03:00.344 --> 1:03:03.034
by our buddies
when we come back. Like...

1:03:03.137 --> 1:03:06.137
We both agreed this made
our friendship definitely like

1:03:06.241 --> 1:03:07.620
a next level.
You know, we've know each other

1:03:07.724 --> 1:03:10.137
for six, seven years,
and, yeah, it was a blast.

1:03:10.241 --> 1:03:11.758
I think I'll stick to football,

1:03:11.862 --> 1:03:13.310
and he can go back
to doing law enforcement.

1:03:13.413 --> 1:03:15.172
Well, we know
you're good at both,

1:03:15.275 --> 1:03:18.068
- um, so there is that.

1:03:18.172 --> 1:03:20.689
I'm a little disappointed 'cause
I think we were just looking

1:03:20.793 --> 1:03:23.310
forward to some antics
from you guys.

1:03:23.413 --> 1:03:24.965
More antics, I should say.

1:03:25.068 --> 1:03:27.965
I'm disappointed as hell,
though, that we never

1:03:28.068 --> 1:03:29.862
- at least got through
a few more.
- Of course.

1:03:29.965 --> 1:03:31.482
But, hey, I mean, every team

1:03:31.586 --> 1:03:33.000
that-that goes out
feels the same way.

1:03:33.103 --> 1:03:34.482
- Absolutely.
- Yup.

- Left, then right?

Now right again.

Push it!

1:04:19.344 --> 1:04:20.793
You said you know where
you're going. You said yes.

1:04:20.896 --> 1:04:22.310
- And I said, "Okay."
- Okay.

1:04:22.413 --> 1:04:24.034
Did I say
"No, I don't think you do"?

1:04:24.137 --> 1:04:26.137
- No, I didn't.

Just roll with me.

there they... here they come.
