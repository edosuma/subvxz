00:01.835 --> 00:03.523
My name is Peter Parker.

00:03.719 --> 00:05.351
I used to be Spider-Man.

00:05.437 --> 00:08.000
<i>I busted bad guys.
I trained with S.H.I.E.L.D.</i>

00:08.169 --> 00:09.914
<i>I teamed up with the Avengers.</i>

00:10.109 --> 00:12.007
<i>I even saved the world
a few times.</i>

00:12.089 --> 00:13.322
That's all over now.

00:13.375 --> 00:15.750
<i>I accidentally led
the world's greatest heroes</i>

00:15.821 --> 00:19.140
<i>right into a trap by Doc Ock
and his Superior Sinister Six.</i>

00:19.306 --> 00:21.203
<i>Then Ock threatened
my Aunt May's life,</i>

00:21.330 --> 00:24.046
<i>forcing me to take a serum
that drained my super powers.</i>

00:24.181 --> 00:26.984
<i>With great power comes
great responsibility,</i>

00:27.139 --> 00:29.039
<i>and the responsible
thing to do...</i>

00:29.137 --> 00:30.992
<i>Was to stop being Spider-Man.</i>

00:31.135 --> 00:32.796
You got what you wanted, Ock.

00:32.893 --> 00:34.328
I don't have my powers anymore.

00:34.435 --> 00:36.397
Yes, but I don't know
if you comprehend

00:36.452 --> 00:39.492
the extent of my victory.

00:40.477 --> 00:43.359
DR. OCTOPUS: Take a closer
view of your handywork.

00:43.437 --> 00:44.554
Look at them.

00:44.632 --> 00:46.803
The heroes at my mercy.

00:46.944 --> 00:50.789
And as they make valiant but
futile attempts to gain freedom,

00:50.905 --> 00:54.765
know that this
is all your fault.

00:54.964 --> 00:57.062
I am certain they now regret

00:57.144 --> 00:59.804
never respecting my true genius.

00:59.868 --> 01:02.609
But since that impenetrable
hard light shell

01:02.648 --> 01:04.406
is collapsing in on them,

01:04.519 --> 01:07.640
they will not have time
to regret it for long.

01:07.766 --> 01:10.898
Where are your
groan-worthy jokes now?

01:11.012 --> 01:13.937
You do not care to quip
as your friends are crushed?

01:13.998 --> 01:15.671
I have nothing to say
to you, Ock.

01:15.773 --> 01:18.170
Nor would I care
to listen if you did.

01:18.245 --> 01:21.146
For without powers,
Peter Parker,

01:21.267 --> 01:24.217
you are nothing.

of this plan which
I have set in motion.

01:46.600 --> 01:48.585
You think you're the first
person to bully me, Ock?

01:48.609 --> 01:51.046
Bully? How dare you!

01:51.145 --> 01:53.179
It is I who have been bullied,

01:53.259 --> 01:56.835
pushed around by those unable
to appreciate my genius.

01:56.905 --> 01:59.054
(GRUNTING)
But I have now proven myself

01:59.163 --> 02:01.593

Stop!
What are you doing to him?

My dear lady, I'm not going
to do anything to your nephew.

02:08.310 --> 02:11.413
Or else he would already be
under that dome. (YELLS)

02:11.600 --> 02:13.140
(GROANS)

02:13.348 --> 02:16.468
I have already destroyed
Spider-Man.

02:16.592 --> 02:20.038
Who cares what happens
to Peter Parker?

02:20.281 --> 02:22.600
You once brought down
the Sinister Six

02:22.663 --> 02:24.736
almost entirely by yourself.

02:24.929 --> 02:27.655
But do you know what's going
to defeat you now?

02:28.760 --> 02:30.624

(GRUNTS)

02:36.529 --> 02:38.053
Oh, Ock's right.

02:38.263 --> 02:40.506
Without my spider strength,
I'm useless.

02:40.616 --> 02:42.975
I've doomed my friends,
and it's all my fault.

02:43.145 --> 02:45.212
I was never cut out
to be a hero.

02:45.458 --> 02:47.607
Some graduation day
this turned out to be.

02:47.670 --> 02:49.498
Speaking of graduation...

02:51.068 --> 02:52.319
Now's not the time.

02:52.389 --> 02:54.921
Just open it. For me.

02:57.627 --> 02:59.576
- My original web shooters?
- Mmm-hmm.

02:59.639 --> 03:00.974
It took me months
to clean them up,

03:00.998 --> 03:02.693
but they're in
perfect condition.

03:02.975 --> 03:04.576
Sure, they don't do
all the fancy stuff

03:04.615 --> 03:06.201
your S.H.I.E.L.D.
web shooters do,

03:06.303 --> 03:08.232
but in a way,
they're much better.

03:08.312 --> 03:09.312
How's that?

03:09.350 --> 03:12.381
Because you made them,
Peter. Alone.

03:12.482 --> 03:13.928
You didn't get
your intelligence,

03:13.959 --> 03:15.967
your imagination,
or your strength of will

03:16.037 --> 03:18.467
from a radioactive spider bite.

03:20.694 --> 03:22.146
I forgot how good these felt.

03:22.287 --> 03:24.459
Long before you were
the Ultimate Spider-Man,

03:24.532 --> 03:26.646
you were the ultimate
Peter Parker.

03:26.726 --> 03:27.998
Hold on.

03:32.045 --> 03:33.521
Maybe there's another way.

03:33.623 --> 03:36.084
I know that look.
You just got an idea.

03:36.256 --> 03:37.959
Possibly. Oscorp.

03:38.045 --> 03:40.545
I didn't see Norman down
at the graduation, he...

03:40.717 --> 03:41.771
He must still be in his lab.

03:41.795 --> 03:44.092
If I could get there,
he could help me.

03:44.428 --> 03:46.618
- Oh, but I...
- I don't want to hear excuses.

03:46.740 --> 03:50.061
Peter Parker doesn't need
spider powers to be a hero.

03:51.154 --> 03:52.951
Even without great power,

03:53.217 --> 03:55.827
there's still
great responsibility.

03:56.146 --> 03:57.595
Thanks, Aunt May.

03:57.779 --> 03:59.428
Now go save them, Peter.

03:59.553 --> 04:01.623

06:09.529 --> 06:11.472
- Norman.
- Spider-Man.

06:11.574 --> 06:14.566
I was on the way to your ceremony.
Is everything okay?

06:14.660 --> 06:17.980
Ock took away my powers and I
need your help to get them back.

06:18.035 --> 06:19.082
You have all his research.

06:19.113 --> 06:20.816
He's been studying me for years.

06:20.910 --> 06:23.676
But Ock's never been able
to replicate you.

06:23.801 --> 06:26.293
Yeah, but maybe
together, we can.

06:26.466 --> 06:28.363
Either way,
we don't have much time.

06:28.488 --> 06:30.988
For such a maniac,
Ock certainly kept

06:31.035 --> 06:32.617
an organized lab.

06:32.777 --> 06:35.027
We'll to need to process
a sample of your DNA.

06:35.152 --> 06:37.988
DNA? In that case...

06:38.136 --> 06:39.668
There's something
I need to tell you.

06:39.830 --> 06:41.371
I already know, Peter.

06:41.543 --> 06:43.668
- What?
- I recovered my memories.

06:43.808 --> 06:45.699
After everything
I did as Goblin,

06:45.761 --> 06:48.666
you were always a friend
to Harry, to my family.

06:48.793 --> 06:50.926
Respecting the privacy
of your identity

06:51.004 --> 06:54.672
was my way of trying to
reciprocate that friendship.

06:54.879 --> 06:57.074
Wow. Thanks, Norman.

06:57.841 --> 06:59.285
Huh?

07:06.629 --> 07:07.764
Whoa!

07:07.871 --> 07:10.988
This must be where Ock harvested
the DNA for his experiments.

07:11.097 --> 07:12.863
No wonder he hid it.

07:14.293 --> 07:17.082
NORMAN: No...
It couldn't be!

07:17.246 --> 07:18.738
It was under my nose all along.

07:18.816 --> 07:21.168
Peter, this is the spider.

07:21.316 --> 07:23.701
What spider?
The spider!

07:23.871 --> 07:26.605
The original radioactive
arachnid that bit you.

07:26.793 --> 07:28.168
Ock must have recovered it.

07:28.293 --> 07:31.926
Clearly, its radiological exposure
lengthened its telomeric structure,

07:32.043 --> 07:33.871
granting it a longer life.

07:34.004 --> 07:37.082
Another bite should
give you your powers back.

07:39.535 --> 07:42.066
Yeah, just pretend
I'm a nice juicy fly and...

07:42.103 --> 07:43.336
Ouch!

07:43.433 --> 07:45.757
You didn't have to
pretend that hard!

Wait... Do I feel
something happening?

With as many lives

11:31.179 --> 11:32.804

call me "Cat-Man"?

I have my powers back as I am!

11:57.053 --> 11:59.452
I was really hoping
we could share this moment!

12:03.023 --> 12:04.866
So much effort, Spider-Man,

12:04.944 --> 12:07.679
yet you will still not be
able to save your friends.

12:07.817 --> 12:09.917
How embarrassing for you?

12:09.999 --> 12:12.296
I don't think you understand
just how high my tolerance

12:12.348 --> 12:13.812

might work on a few

After everything I've done
to empower them,

14:33.609 --> 14:35.497
you would think they'd
have enough respect

14:35.532 --> 14:36.827
not to betray me.

14:36.929 --> 14:38.796
Respect, Ock?

about helping others.
