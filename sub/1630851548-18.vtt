IT ALL BEGIN BUT IT GOES TO

09:53.233 --> 09:53.700
THESE QUESTIONS WE'VE ALL

09:53.766 --> 09:56.566
CARRIED WITH US.

09:56.633 --> 09:58.233
IF YOU DIDN'T CARRY IT WITH YOU

09:58.300 --> 09:58.800
STUMBLED ON IT AND IT TOOK

09:58.866 --> 10:01.600
CAUSING YOUR LIFE TO REFLECT ON

10:01.666 --> 10:02.666
IT, HOW DID ALL BEGIN, WHAT IS

10:02.733 --> 10:04.366
IT ALL MADE OF?

10:04.433 --> 10:06.000
ARE WE ALONE IN THE UNIVERSE,

10:06.066 --> 10:06.866
THAT IS BIG NEWS IN RECENT

10:06.933 --> 10:11.633
MONTHS AND HOW WO WILL IT ALL E?

10:11.700 --> 10:13.300
>> Bill: LET'S GET TO HOW IT

10:13.366 --> 10:15.233
ALL BEGAN FIRST.

10:15.300 --> 10:16.500
I WANT ASK YOU ABOUT THE BIG

10:16.566 --> 10:19.566
BANG THEORY -- NOT THE SHOW, THE

10:19.633 --> 10:19.900
ACTUAL THEORY.

10:19.966 --> 10:21.000
>> IF YOU TYPE BIG BANG THEORY

10:21.066 --> 10:22.700
INTO GOOGLE, THE FIRST THING IS

10:22.766 --> 10:24.600
A TV SHOW AND I DON'T KNOW IF

10:24.666 --> 10:25.366
THAT'S GOOD OR BAD.

10:25.433 --> 10:29.500
>> Bill: THAT'S BAD.

10:29.566 --> 10:30.166
[LAUGHTER]

10:30.233 --> 10:30.400
>> OKAY.

10:30.466 --> 10:31.966
>> Bill: YOU'RE THE GUY WHO

10:32.033 --> 10:32.866
CAN ANSWER THIS QUESTION FOR

10:32.933 --> 10:36.100
ME -- HOW SETTLED IS IT?

10:36.166 --> 10:40.833
ON A SCALE OF EVOLUTION, WHEN

10:40.900 --> 10:42.333
DARWIN'S ORIGIN OF SPECIES IS

10:42.400 --> 10:44.666
PUBLISHED IN 1859, IT WASN'T

10:44.733 --> 10:46.400
SETTLED SCIENCE, THEY DEBATED IT

10:46.466 --> 10:49.066
FOR DECADES, AS SCIENCE SHOULD.

10:49.133 --> 10:50.300
PEOPLE SAID LET'S TRY TO POKE

10:50.366 --> 10:52.466
HOLES IN IT, THEY DIDN'T.

10:52.533 --> 10:54.666
NOW IT'S SETTLED SCIENCE, I

10:54.733 --> 10:56.966
WOULD LIKE TO SAY THIS ABOUT

10:57.033 --> 10:58.400
GLOBAL WARMING BEING MAN-MADE, I

10:58.466 --> 10:59.800
THINK IT IS IN THE SCIENTIFIC

10:59.866 --> 11:01.266
COMMUNITY, NOT SO MUCH IN THE

11:01.333 --> 11:02.466
POLITICAL IMMUNITY, BUT WHAT

11:02.533 --> 11:04.500
ABOUT THE BIG BANG THEORY?

11:04.566 --> 11:06.566
IS NOT SOMETHING WE ARE TOTALLY

11:06.633 --> 11:07.266
NOW, EVERYBODY WHO HAS YOUR

11:07.333 --> 11:11.766
BRAIN, ALL OF EIGHT PEOPLE, THEY

11:11.833 --> 11:12.200
ARE DOWN WITH THIS?

11:12.266 --> 11:18.433
>> YES, BECAUSE IT SATISFIES ALL

11:18.500 --> 11:19.833
OF THE OBSERVATIONAL DATA THAT

11:19.900 --> 11:24.566
NEEDS ACCOUNTING FOR OUR NEATLY

11:24.633 --> 11:25.433
CONTAINED WITHIN THE

11:25.500 --> 11:26.433
UNDERSTANDING THAT COMES TO US

11:26.500 --> 11:27.366
FROM THE BIG BANG.

11:27.433 --> 11:29.000
THE UNIVERSE IS BIGGER TODAY

11:29.066 --> 11:30.600
THAN IT WAS YESTERDAY, THE

11:30.666 --> 11:31.200
UNIVERSE WAS HOTTER YESTERDAY

11:31.266 --> 11:32.800
THAN IT WAS TODAY.

11:32.866 --> 11:35.800
YOU GO BACK FAR ENOUGH,

11:35.866 --> 11:36.833
14 BILLION YEARS, ALL OF THE

11:36.900 --> 11:39.166
KNOWN UNIVERSE WAS IN THE SAME

11:39.233 --> 11:39.933
PLACE AT THE SAME TIME AT A

11:40.000 --> 11:42.833
STUPENDOUSLY HIGH TEMPERATURE.

11:42.900 --> 11:43.800
THEN YOU COULD SAY HOW DO YOU

11:43.866 --> 11:47.100
KNOW, YOU WORKED THERE -- WELL,

11:47.166 --> 11:48.966
IF MATTER AND ENERGY ARE AT THAT

11:49.033 --> 11:51.266
TEMPERATURE, IT COMES WITH

11:51.333 --> 11:51.600
CONSEQUENCES.

11:51.666 --> 11:53.066
SO WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF MATTER

11:53.133 --> 11:54.600
AND ENERGY WERE AT TEMPERATURE

11:54.666 --> 11:55.766
FOR THIS LONG, YOU GET ABOUT

11:55.833 --> 11:56.400
THIS MUCH HYDROGEN IN THE

11:56.466 --> 11:58.700
UNIVERSE COME ABOUT THAT MUCH

11:58.766 --> 11:59.266
HELIUM.

11:59.333 --> 12:01.733
>> Bill: IT WAS ALL

12:01.800 --> 12:03.333
CONDENSED -- THIS IS AMAZING

12:03.400 --> 12:05.533
BECAUSE WE ARE TALKING ABOUT

12:05.600 --> 12:07.000
TRILLIONS OF STARS WHICH ARE

12:07.066 --> 12:07.166
BIG.

12:07.233 --> 12:10.133
>> WAY MORE THAN TRILLIONS.

12:10.200 --> 12:12.300
>> Bill: WHY DO IT THAT WAY?

12:12.366 --> 12:15.400
WHY START THE UNIVERSE THAT WAY,

12:15.466 --> 12:16.000
LIKE BANG!

12:16.066 --> 12:16.866
LET'S ALL MATCH IT UP AND BLOW

12:16.933 --> 12:19.800
IT UP?

12:19.866 --> 12:21.233
WHY DO IT THAT WAY?

12:21.300 --> 12:22.900
>> THAT'S WHY PEOPLE INVENT

12:22.966 --> 12:24.933
RELIGION TO ACCOUNT FOR WHY.

12:25.000 --> 12:26.033
IN SCIENCE WE WILL TELL YOU HOW

12:26.100 --> 12:26.666
THAT HAPPENED BUT YOU WANT TO

12:26.733 --> 12:30.633
KNOW IF THERE'S PURPOSE TO IT?

12:30.700 --> 12:31.800
THAT'S A PHILOSOPHICAL BORDERING

12:31.866 --> 12:32.466
ON RELIGIOUS QUESTION THAT SOME

12:32.533 --> 12:34.066
PEOPLE FEEL THE NEED TO REACH

12:34.133 --> 12:37.700
FOR AND POSSIBLY FIND, AND MANY

12:37.766 --> 12:38.833
QUESTIONS ON THE FRONTIER OF OUR

12:38.900 --> 12:41.733
KNOWLEDGE, THE FRONTIER OF OUR

12:41.800 --> 12:44.233
IGNORANCE LAND SQUARELY IN THE

12:44.300 --> 12:44.866
LAP OF THE ARMCHAIR PHILOSOPHER

12:44.933 --> 12:47.733
OR THE RELIGIOUS HOLY PERSON ON

12:47.800 --> 12:50.200
THE MOUNT.

12:50.266 --> 12:52.166
>> Bill: THAT IS NEITHER OF

12:52.233 --> 12:52.333
US.

12:52.400 --> 12:53.866
>> THAT'S CORRECT BUT I'M

12:53.933 --> 12:57.433
CONTENT SAYING I CAN EXPLAIN

12:57.500 --> 12:59.433
THIS, I CAN ACCOUNT FOR HOW THAT

12:59.500 --> 13:00.033
HAPPENS.

13:00.100 --> 13:01.800
THAT IS A PROFOUND PLACE TO BE

13:01.866 --> 13:03.200
BECAUSE MOST OF THE HISTORY OF

13:03.266 --> 13:04.433
HUMAN CIVILIZATION, WE HAD NO

13:04.500 --> 13:07.000
ACCOUNTING OF THINGS.

13:07.066 --> 13:08.066
>> Bill: IT SOUNDS CRAZY BUT

13:08.133 --> 13:09.666
YOU ARE A LOT SMARTER THAN THE

13:09.733 --> 13:14.000
PREACHER SO I'M TO GO WITH YOU.

13:14.066 --> 13:14.266
[LAUGHTER]

13:14.333 --> 13:15.533
[APPLAUSE]

13:15.600 --> 13:16.200
THAT'S REALLY WHERE I'M AT

13:16.266 --> 13:18.466
BECAUSE IT'S FRUSTRATING BECAUSE

13:18.533 --> 13:22.166
I PERSONALLY CAN'T GET TO THAT

13:22.233 --> 13:24.466
PLACE WHERE I GO "OH, YEAH, SURE

13:24.533 --> 13:26.666
COME ALL MATTER, ONE PLACE, GOT

13:26.733 --> 13:27.400
IT."

13:27.466 --> 13:28.933
MY FAITH IS IN YOU.

13:29.000 --> 13:32.000
>> I DON'T NEED YOUR FAITH.

13:32.066 --> 13:33.066
>> Bill: I WAS TRYING TO BE

13:33.133 --> 13:37.800
NICE, FUCK.

13:37.866 --> 13:38.700
[LAUGHTER]

13:38.766 --> 13:38.966
NEVER MIND.

13:39.033 --> 13:41.133
>> I DON'T NEED YOUR FAITH, I

13:41.200 --> 13:42.133
JUST NEED EVIDENCE IN SUPPORT OF

13:42.200 --> 13:44.400
THE CLAIM AND ALLOW ME TO ALSO

13:44.466 --> 13:45.933
SAY THAT THE UNIVERSE IS UNDER

13:46.000 --> 13:48.033
NO OBLIGATION TO MAKE SENSE TO

13:48.100 --> 13:49.766
YOU.

13:49.833 --> 13:51.633
>> Bill: I DON'T EVEN FUCKING

13:51.700 --> 13:52.833
THINK ABOUT THIS SHIT UNLESS

13:52.900 --> 13:56.600
YOU'RE ON THE SHOW.

13:56.666 --> 13:57.800
[LAUGHTER]

13:57.866 --> 13:59.500
I DO, I ACTUALLY DO.

13:59.566 --> 14:01.133
[APPLAUSE]

14:01.200 --> 14:02.833
>> IF YOU ASKED ME WHAT WAS

14:02.900 --> 14:04.466
BEFORE THE BIG BANG, WE HAVE

14:04.533 --> 14:05.466
SOME IDEAS BUT I DON'T REALLY

14:05.533 --> 14:07.633
KNOW AND I'M OKAY WITH THAT.

14:07.700 --> 14:08.933
AS A SCIENTIST, YOU NEED TO

14:09.000 --> 14:10.800
LEARN TO LOVE THE QUESTIONS

14:10.866 --> 14:11.966
THEMSELVES LEST YOU JUST START

14:12.033 --> 14:12.800
THROWING ANSWERS AND SO YOU CAN

14:12.866 --> 14:15.900
GO TO BED AT NIGHT AND NOT LOSE

14:15.966 --> 14:16.400
SLEEP.

14:16.466 --> 14:17.533
>> Bill: I HAVE SO MANY BIGGER

14:17.600 --> 14:20.066
THINGS -- TRUMP IS STILL OUT

14:20.133 --> 14:22.566
THERE, ARE YOU KIDDING?

14:22.633 --> 14:24.766
THINK I'M WORRIED ABOUT THE

14:24.833 --> 14:25.533
UNIVERSE?

14:25.600 --> 14:25.800
[APPLAUSE]

14:25.866 --> 14:27.166
>> CAN I COMMENT ON THAT?

14:27.233 --> 14:29.433
TO BRING A COSMIC PERSPECTIVE TO

14:29.500 --> 14:32.766
THAT SENTENCE, TRUMP IS THE

14:32.833 --> 14:35.900
BRUNT OF MOST OF YOUR JOKES.

14:35.966 --> 14:37.133
>> Bill: KNOW HE'S NOT COME

14:37.200 --> 14:39.900
YOU DON'T WATCH THE SHOW.

14:39.966 --> 14:43.633
WHEN HE WAS PRESIDENT.

14:43.700 --> 14:45.366
>> I'M JUST SAYING 76 MILLION

14:45.433 --> 14:46.066
PEOPLE VOTED FOR HIM, SEE YOUR

14:46.133 --> 14:49.166
ENEMY IS IN HIM, IT'S FELLOW

14:49.233 --> 14:50.700
CITIZENS OF THE UNITED STATES.

14:50.766 --> 14:51.566
>> Bill: THAT'S WRONG, WE'RE

14:51.633 --> 14:54.033
ON THE WRONG SUBJECT HERE, YOU

14:54.100 --> 14:55.400
CAN HATE TRUMP, YOU CAN'T HATE

14:55.466 --> 14:56.700
THE PEOPLE WHO VOTED FOR HIM,

14:56.766 --> 14:57.833
THAT'S HALF THE COUNTRY, YOU

14:57.900 --> 15:00.133
CANNOT HATE HALF THE COUNTRY.

15:00.200 --> 15:02.633
>> THEY PUT HIM INTO OFFICE.

15:02.700 --> 15:03.766
>> Bill: THEY PUT HIM INTO

15:03.833 --> 15:04.900
OFFICE FOR A LOT OF DIFFERENT

15:04.966 --> 15:05.133
REASONS.

15:05.200 --> 15:07.600
>> I'M AN EDUCATOR, I CARE ABOUT

15:07.666 --> 15:09.000
THE ELECTORATE.

15:09.066 --> 15:10.566
>> Bill: I DO TOO AND THAT'S

15:10.633 --> 15:11.900
NOT THE WAY TO WIN THEM BACK,

15:11.966 --> 15:15.000
TELL THEM THEIR DEPLORABLE AND

15:15.066 --> 15:15.533
YOU HATE THEM.

15:15.600 --> 15:16.533
>> THAT'S NOT WHAT I TELL THEM,

15:16.600 --> 15:18.700
I JUST.

15:18.766 --> 15:19.066
[LAUGHTER]

15:19.133 --> 15:20.566
>> Bill: LET'S M MOVE ON TO THE

15:20.633 --> 15:23.433
FIELD WE ARE HERE FOR BECAUSE

15:23.500 --> 15:23.866
YOU MENTIONED UFOs.

15:23.933 --> 15:25.800
>> THERE'S A CHAPTER THE BOOK

15:25.866 --> 15:27.400
CALLED ARE WE ALONE IN THE

15:27.466 --> 15:27.666
UNIVERSE?

15:27.733 --> 15:30.400
>> Bill: THAT'S UFOs.

15:30.466 --> 15:35.000
>> AS THE GOVERNMENT CALLS IT,

15:35.066 --> 15:36.800
UAP -- UNIDENTIFIED AERIAL

15:36.866 --> 15:37.100
PHENOMENON.

15:37.166 --> 15:38.333
THAT'S THEY'RE NOT SO

15:38.400 --> 15:39.866
TRANSPARENT TRANSLATION.

15:39.933 --> 15:45.200
>> Bill: ARE WE MARRIED?

15:45.266 --> 15:46.633
YOU'RE FIGHTING EVERYTHING I

15:46.700 --> 15:46.800
SAY.

15:46.866 --> 15:47.566
[LAUGHTER]

15:47.633 --> 15:48.200
YOU JUST WANT TO PICK A FIGHT.

15:48.266 --> 15:52.700
[APPLAUSE]

15:52.766 --> 15:53.800
THIS IS CHANGED RADICALLY IN THE

15:53.866 --> 15:54.566
LAST YEAR COME IN THE PAST IF

15:54.633 --> 15:55.333
YOU WOULD'VE SAID UFOs I

15:55.400 --> 15:58.500
WOULD'VE SAID MAYBE, IT'S

15:58.566 --> 15:59.500
CERTAINLY NOT UNSCIENTIFIC TO

15:59.566 --> 16:02.233
THINK THEY COULD BE OUT THERE OR

16:02.300 --> 16:02.466
HERE.

16:02.533 --> 16:06.366
IN THE LAST YEAR OR SO NOW,

16:06.433 --> 16:07.700
THINGS HAVE CHANGED A LOT.

16:07.766 --> 16:08.800
NAVY PILOTS HAVE COME FORWARD

16:08.866 --> 16:10.166
AND SAY THERE ARE THINGS WE SEE

16:10.233 --> 16:11.466
ALL THE TIME AND WE CANNOT

16:11.533 --> 16:12.666
EXPLAIN AND THEY MOVE IN WAYS

16:12.733 --> 16:14.400
THAT WE DO NOT KNOW HOW THEY

16:14.466 --> 16:17.566
MOVE AND WE CAN'T MOVE THAT WAY.

16:17.633 --> 16:18.466
AND VERY SERIOUS PEOPLE LIKE

16:18.533 --> 16:20.766
JOHN BRENNAN AND HARRY REID HAS

16:20.833 --> 16:21.200
HAD THE SAME THING.

16:21.266 --> 16:23.800
WE ARE LOOKING INTO THIS, THEY

16:23.866 --> 16:25.966
SAID WE AREN'T DENYING IT

16:26.033 --> 16:28.366
ANYMORE.

16:28.433 --> 16:29.900
SO, YOU'VE COME A GREAT PERSON

16:29.966 --> 16:31.166
TO ANSWER THIS QUESTION,

16:31.233 --> 16:35.900
UFOs -- WHAT'S THE DEAL?

16:35.966 --> 16:36.333
[LAUGHTER]

16:36.400 --> 16:40.500
>> HOW MUCH TIME YOU GOT?

16:40.566 --> 16:41.466
THE UNIVERSE BRIMS WITH

16:41.533 --> 16:41.900
MYSTERIES.

16:42.000 --> 16:43.866
IF I THINK THE WAY YOU SHOULD

16:43.933 --> 16:44.433
COME AT THIS IS FROM ANOTHER

16:44.500 --> 16:47.000
DIRECTION AND ASK.

16:47.066 --> 16:50.833
IF WE ARE IN FACT BEING VISITED

16:50.900 --> 16:52.033
BY INTELLIGENT ALIENS FROM

16:52.100 --> 16:53.566
ANOTHER PLANET, WHY WOULD THEY

16:53.633 --> 16:56.300
ONLY REVEAL THEMSELVES TO NAVY

16:56.366 --> 16:57.400
PILOTS?

16:57.466 --> 17:01.166
WHY BUT NONE OF THEM EVER SHOW

17:01.233 --> 17:03.400
UP IN THE 6 BILLION COLOR

17:03.466 --> 17:04.566
HIGH-RESOLUTION PHOTOS AND

17:04.633 --> 17:05.233
VIDEOS HUMAN BEINGS ARE UPLOADED

17:05.300 --> 17:08.933
TO THE INTERNET EVERY DAY?

17:09.000 --> 17:10.700
>> Bill: THEY ARE UP IN SPACE

17:10.766 --> 17:12.266
TAKING PICTURES WITH THE NAVY

17:12.333 --> 17:12.633
PILOTS ARE!

17:12.700 --> 17:16.200
>> WHY IS THEIR BEST IMAGE OF AN

17:16.266 --> 17:17.533
ALIEN A FUZZY MONOCHROMATIC

17:17.600 --> 17:19.200
TIC TAC ON A DISPLAY SCREEN?

17:19.266 --> 17:24.200
>> Bill: I'M JUST SAYING --

17:24.266 --> 17:25.933
WHAT YOU THINK IT IS?

17:26.000 --> 17:29.666
>> THAT'S WHAT THE U STANDS FOR

17:29.733 --> 17:31.966
IN UNIDENTIFIED!

17:32.033 --> 17:34.100
IT'S A UFO AND IT'S DOING WEIRD

17:34.166 --> 17:35.533
THINGS, THEREFORE I KNOW WHAT IT

17:35.600 --> 17:35.966
IS?

17:36.033 --> 17:36.633
YOU JUST ADMITTED YOU DON'T KNOW

17:36.700 --> 17:38.333
WHAT IT IS.

17:38.400 --> 17:41.433
>> Bill: IT'S THE BEGINNING.

17:41.500 --> 17:45.433
IF THERE UFOs, PEOPLE WHO

17:45.500 --> 17:47.100
NEVER CAME FORWARD BEFORE FROM A

17:47.166 --> 17:48.766
SERIOUS PEOPLE, MILITARY PEOPLE.

17:48.833 --> 17:51.766
>> THAT DOESN'T MATTER, ARE YOU

17:51.833 --> 17:52.633
HUMAN?

17:52.700 --> 17:54.833
YOU ARE EQUALLY SUSCEPTLE TO

17:54.900 --> 17:57.133
DELUSION TOBIAS TO SAY IT'S A

17:57.200 --> 17:59.733
NAVY PILOT, I DON'T CARE, THEIR

17:59.800 --> 17:59.933
HUMAN.

18:00.000 --> 18:02.433
>> Bill: WHAT ELSE COULD IT BE

18:02.500 --> 18:02.600
BE?

18:02.666 --> 18:04.400
>> I DON'T KNOW!

18:04.466 --> 18:06.700
>> Bill: I AGREE.

18:06.766 --> 18:08.700
>> IT THAT DOESN'T MEAN IT'S

18:08.766 --> 18:09.233
VISITING ALIENS FROM OUTER

18:09.300 --> 18:10.533
SPACE.

18:10.600 --> 18:12.033
>> Bill: IF THERE'S NOT

18:12.100 --> 18:14.633
ANOTHER THEORY, IT LOADS THE

18:14.700 --> 18:14.833
GUN --

18:14.900 --> 18:17.733
>> I GOT ONE, EVERY PIECE OF

18:17.800 --> 18:18.566
HARDWARE I HAVE EVER SEEN AND

18:18.633 --> 18:20.033
THE SOFTWARE I HAVE EVER SEEN

18:20.100 --> 18:22.500
PROGRAMMED HAS GLITCHES, EVERY

18:22.566 --> 18:25.000
TIME, EVERY ONE.

18:25.066 --> 18:26.433
THAT'S WHY YOU HAVE SOFTWARE

18:26.500 --> 18:26.966
UPDATES ALL THE TIME.

18:27.033 --> 18:28.866
>> Bill: GREAT, LET'S GO WITH

18:28.933 --> 18:31.033
THAT.

18:31.100 --> 18:33.266
>> I'M SAYING THE IMAGING SYSTEM

18:33.333 --> 18:34.833
THEY ARE USING COULD HAVE

18:34.900 --> 18:35.966
GLITCHES AND THEY WILL SAY WE

18:36.033 --> 18:37.800
CHECKED IT IT DOESN'T HAVE

18:37.866 --> 18:38.966
GLITCHES, OKAY, ARE YOU SO SURE

18:39.033 --> 18:40.466
IT DOESN'T HAVE GLITCHES THAT

18:40.533 --> 18:41.600
YOU WOULD RATHER BELIEVE IT

18:41.666 --> 18:43.000
DOESN'T HAVE GLITCHES SO THAT

18:43.066 --> 18:45.733
YOU CAN NOW SAY WE ARE BEING

18:45.800 --> 18:46.733
VISITED BY INTELLIGENT ALIENS

18:46.800 --> 18:48.166
FROM ANOTHER PLANET WITH UNKNOWN

18:48.233 --> 18:48.400
PHYSICS?

18:48.466 --> 18:50.766
THAT'S A HUGE LEAP.

18:50.833 --> 18:51.733
>> Bill: IF THERE ARE ALIENS

18:51.800 --> 18:53.266
AND THEY DO COME HERE, YOU THINK

18:53.333 --> 18:55.733
THEY MIGHT HAVE THE ANSWERS TO

18:55.800 --> 18:57.066
THESE QUESTIONS WE DON'T KNOW?

18:57.133 --> 18:59.166
REALLY COME OUT WOULDN'T THAT BE

18:59.233 --> 18:59.366
GREAT?

18:59.433 --> 18:59.633
[LAUGHTER]

18:59.700 --> 19:03.833
[APPLAUSE]

19:03.900 --> 19:05.700
WE SAY WHAT HAPPENED BEFORE THE

19:05.766 --> 19:09.066
BIG BANG.

19:09.133 --> 19:12.900
>> LITTLE JR. KNOWS THAT.

19:12.966 --> 19:13.833
>> Bill: IT'S RIGHT ON MY

19:13.900 --> 19:15.000
PHONE!

19:15.066 --> 19:15.966
>> I LOSE SLEEP AT NIGHT

19:16.033 --> 19:19.100
WONDERING WHETHER WE, WHO WE

19:19.166 --> 19:20.533
DEFINE AS THE FIRST TRULY

19:20.600 --> 19:22.566
INTELLIGENT SPECIES ON EARTH HAS

19:22.633 --> 19:24.133
SUFFICIENT INTELLIGENCE TO

19:24.200 --> 19:24.700
ANSWER THE QUESTIONS WE POSE

19:24.766 --> 19:27.466
ABOUT THE UNIVERSE AND I FURTHER

19:27.533 --> 19:29.766
WORRY WHETHER WE ARE INTELLIGENT

19:29.833 --> 19:30.733
ENOUGH TO EVEN KNOW WHAT

19:30.800 --> 19:32.266
QUESTIONS TO ASK.

19:32.333 --> 19:35.333
>> Bill: ON THAT HAPPY NOTE,

19:35.400 --> 19:36.966
YOU'RE ALWAYS A PLEASURE TO TALK

19:37.033 --> 19:39.166
TO, I WISH IT COULD BE HERE, I

19:39.233 --> 19:40.333
WILL SEE YOU FOR DINNER LATER,

19:40.400 --> 19:48.600
LET'S MEET OUR PANEL!

19:48.666 --> 19:49.066
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

19:49.133 --> 19:49.800
SHE'S A POLITICAL SCIENTIST AND

19:49.866 --> 19:50.433
CO FOUNDER OF STRIKE PAC: RACHEL

19:50.500 --> 19:53.766
BITECOFER.

19:53.833 --> 19:56.066
GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

19:56.133 --> 19:57.500
YOU KNOW THIS GUY.

19:57.566 --> 19:58.466
HE'S AN ACTIVIST AND FILMMAKER

19:58.533 --> 19:59.066
WHO'S DIRECTED AND STARRED IN

19:59.133 --> 19:59.800
PRETTY MUCH ALL OF YOUR FAVORITE

19:59.866 --> 20:00.333
MOVIES OVER THE LAST FOUR

20:00.400 --> 20:06.566
DECADES: ROB REINER.

20:06.633 --> 20:07.200
HOW ARE YOU?

20:07.266 --> 20:12.133
>> I'M GOOD!

20:12.200 --> 20:14.966
WHEN ARE WE GOING TO GET CLOSER,

20:15.033 --> 20:17.166
WHEN WERE NOT SO FAR AWAY?

20:17.233 --> 20:18.566
>> Bill: WE ARE GOING TO GET

20:18.633 --> 20:19.200
TO THIS ISSUE BECAUSE IT'S

20:19.266 --> 20:21.833
PISSING ME OFF.

20:21.900 --> 20:25.766
FOR ME, YESTERDAY.

20:25.833 --> 20:26.800
>> BECAUSE I WANT TO BE CLOSER

20:26.866 --> 20:29.600
TO YOU.

20:29.666 --> 20:33.733
NOT FOR ANY OTHER REASON THAN I

20:33.800 --> 20:34.933
CAN COMMUNICATE BETTER.

20:35.033 --> 20:38.400
>> I TAKE THAT UP, THAT'S ROB

20:38.466 --> 20:38.633
REINER.

20:38.700 --> 20:40.366
>> Bill: NEIL deGRASSE TYSON

20:40.433 --> 20:42.233
IS FIGHTING WITH ME, YOU WANT TO

20:42.300 --> 20:44.300
GET CLOSER TO ME, IS IT MY

20:44.366 --> 20:48.333
COLOGNE, AM I WEARING SOMETHING?

20:48.400 --> 20:50.533
LAST WEEK, IT SEEMS LIKE EVERY

20:50.600 --> 20:52.066
WEEK, THIS WAS AN ISSUE THAT IS,

20:52.133 --> 20:56.066
EVERY WEEK.

20:56.133 --> 20:57.133
THIS PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY WHO

20:57.200 --> 20:58.200
WANT TO STOP US FROM BEING A

20:58.266 --> 21:00.533
DEMOCRACY AND THERE'S NO BIGGER

21:00.600 --> 21:02.300
ISSUE.

21:02.366 --> 21:05.366
WE TALK ABOUT WHAT TO THE

21:05.433 --> 21:06.566
DEMOCRATS DO TO STOP THIS

21:06.633 --> 21:07.200
MONKEYING BEHIND THE SCENES WITH

21:07.266 --> 21:09.033
WHAT'S GOING ON WITH OUR

21:09.100 --> 21:09.366
ELECTIONS?

21:09.433 --> 21:11.766
I READ THIS WEEK, THERE ARE NO

21:11.833 --> 21:13.400
DEATH THREATS FROM TRUMP PEOPLE

21:13.466 --> 21:16.033
ON ELECTION -- PEOPLE WHO RUN

21:16.100 --> 21:18.000
ELECTIONS.

21:18.066 --> 21:19.600
THERE IS NOTHING THEY WILL NOT

21:19.666 --> 21:21.733
TRY AND WE ARE TALKING ABOUT

21:21.800 --> 21:23.033
REPLACING PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY

21:23.100 --> 21:24.366
COUNT THE VOTES, IT'S ONE THING

21:24.433 --> 21:26.900
TO STOP PEOPLE FROM VOTING, THAT

21:26.966 --> 21:27.566
IS WRONG.

21:27.633 --> 21:29.766
REPLACING PEOPLE WHO CERTIFY THE

21:29.833 --> 21:29.966
VOTES.

21:30.033 --> 21:32.200
OBAMA THIS WEEK ON TV SAID "THE

21:32.266 --> 21:33.133
REPUBLICAN PARTY IS WILLING TO

21:33.200 --> 21:35.700
EMBRACE A WAY OF THINKING ABOUT

21:35.766 --> 21:37.766
DEMOCRACY THAT WOULD BE

21:37.833 --> 21:38.733
UNRECOGNIZABLE, AND EVEN

21:38.800 --> 21:39.700
UNACCEPTABLE, EVEN FIVE YEARS

21:39.766 --> 21:41.500
AGO."

21:41.566 --> 21:43.400
I WAS TOLD YOU ARE WATCHING THIS

21:43.466 --> 21:45.500
LAST WEEK AND YOU SAID "I KNOW

21:45.566 --> 21:47.766
WHAT THE DEMOCRATS CAN DO."

21:47.833 --> 21:49.200
I'M ANXIOUS TO HEAR THAT.

21:49.266 --> 21:50.800
>> IT WAS LIKE THE GHOST OF

21:50.866 --> 21:55.966
CHRISTMAS PAST AND SCROOGE

21:56.033 --> 21:58.166
YELLING LET'S MAKE A DEAL --

21:58.233 --> 21:58.966
TAKE THE BOX!

21:59.033 --> 21:59.766
[LAUGHTER]

21:59.833 --> 22:01.133
I HAVE A SOLUTION BUT IT'S NOT

22:01.200 --> 22:03.600
AN EASY PILL AND THIS IS A BOLD

22:03.666 --> 22:03.800
IDEA.

22:03.866 --> 22:07.433
WE HAVE TO STOP SUCKING AT

22:07.500 --> 22:09.933
ELECTORAL POLITICS IF WE WANT TO

22:10.000 --> 22:11.166
TAKE POWER AND HOLD OFF THIS

22:11.233 --> 22:14.766
DEMOCRATIC COUP THAT IS COMING.

22:14.833 --> 22:15.400
>> Bill: REPUBLICAN COUP.

22:15.466 --> 22:18.200
>> YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT VOTER

22:18.266 --> 22:19.933
SUPPRESSION, IT'S ELECTION

22:20.000 --> 22:20.366
RIGGING.

22:20.433 --> 22:22.333
THEY ARE CLOSING THE POLLING

22:22.400 --> 22:23.266
BOOTHS AND EXPANDING ACCESS IN

22:23.333 --> 22:25.833
RURAL AREAS AND IT'S NOT AN

22:25.900 --> 22:26.366
IDEA, THEY ARE PUTTING

22:26.433 --> 22:28.233
PROVISIONS IN THESE LAWS THAT

22:28.300 --> 22:29.666
ARE GOING TO ALLOW IF YOU

22:29.733 --> 22:30.933
OVERCOME THAT IN GEORGIA OR

22:31.000 --> 22:33.000
TEXAS FOR THEM TO SAY YOU KNOW

22:33.066 --> 22:33.200
WHAT?

22:33.266 --> 22:34.633
THIS DOESN'T SEEM RIGHT TO US SO

22:34.700 --> 22:36.700
WE'RE JUST NOT GOING TO COUNT

22:36.766 --> 22:36.966
THE VOTES.

22:37.033 --> 22:38.000
>> Bill: WE ARE STILL NOT

22:38.066 --> 22:40.166
GETTING TO THE PART OF WHAT WE

22:40.233 --> 22:40.400
DO.

22:40.466 --> 22:43.166
>> WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS WE NEED

22:43.233 --> 22:46.333
TO START FIGHTING THEM, FIRE

22:46.400 --> 22:46.933
WITH FIRE.

22:47.000 --> 22:47.533
>> Bill: MEANING?

22:47.600 --> 22:49.533
>> THEY ARE GOING TO COME OUT IN

22:49.600 --> 22:50.766
THIS ELECTORAL CYCLE WHICH

22:50.833 --> 22:52.733
BEGINS ALREADY BECAUSE WE HAVE

22:52.800 --> 22:54.000
AN OFF YEAR ELECTION HERE IN THE

22:54.066 --> 22:54.233
RECALL.

22:54.300 --> 22:58.300
>> Bill: WHAT DO WE DO?

22:58.366 --> 22:59.400
>> GAVIN NEWSOM IS GETTING

22:59.466 --> 23:00.033
RECALLED AS A STRATEGIC ATTACK

23:00.100 --> 23:01.100
FOR THEM TO CONSOLIDATE POWER SO

23:01.166 --> 23:04.833
WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS FORTIFY AT

23:04.900 --> 23:06.200
PATH TO POWER CONSOLIDATION AND

23:06.266 --> 23:08.533
THAT MEANS WE HAVE TO BE BETTER

23:08.600 --> 23:09.333
AT MESSAGING AND BETTER AT

23:09.400 --> 23:11.400
ELECTIONEERING RIGHT AWAY LIKE

23:11.466 --> 23:12.933
YESTERDAY.

23:13.000 --> 23:13.333
>> Bill: METHOD IS

23:13.400 --> 23:17.400
DISAPPOINTING ANSWER.

23:17.466 --> 23:21.133
I'M TALKING ABOUT STOPPING --

23:21.200 --> 23:21.733
MERRICK GARLAND OUR

23:21.800 --> 23:22.833
ATTORNEY GENERAL WHO SHOULD BE

23:22.900 --> 23:24.066
ON THIS FINALLY TODAY MADE A

23:24.133 --> 23:27.600
SPEECH ABOUT THIS, HE SAID HE'S

23:27.666 --> 23:28.366
GOING TO DOUBLE THE NUMBER OF

23:28.433 --> 23:32.933
STAFF IN THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT

23:33.000 --> 23:36.300
DEDICATED TO PROTECTING VOTING

23:36.366 --> 23:37.300
RIGHTS -- I DON'T KNOW WHAT

23:37.366 --> 23:38.966
THAT'S GOING TO DO BUT IT'S A

23:39.033 --> 23:39.400
START.

23:39.466 --> 23:40.533
HE SAID 14 STATES HAVE PASSED

23:40.600 --> 23:42.300
NEW LAWS THAT MAKE IT HARDER TO

23:42.366 --> 23:43.733
DEVOTE, WE ARE SCRUTINIZING NEW

23:43.800 --> 23:45.900
LAWS LIKE THAT AND WHERE WE SEE

23:45.966 --> 23:47.766
VIOLATIONS WE WILL NOT HESITATE

23:47.833 --> 23:48.100
TO ACT.

23:48.166 --> 23:49.500
SOUNDS VAGUE TO ME BUT AT LEAST

23:49.566 --> 23:54.333
IT SEEMS LIKE HE'S AWARE OF IT.

23:54.400 --> 23:57.133
>> THE THING IS, THAT IS ALL

23:57.200 --> 23:58.566
WELL AND GOOD BUT ALL THAT MEANS

23:58.633 --> 24:00.800
IS YOU CAN PROSECUTE SOMEBODY

24:00.866 --> 24:02.766
WHO WOULD BREAK THOSE LAWS.

24:02.833 --> 24:04.500
WE HAVE TO GET LAWS IN PLACE

24:04.566 --> 24:06.733
THAT PROTECT OUR RIGHT TO VOTE.

24:06.800 --> 24:08.933
THERE ARE A NUMBER OF BILLS IN

24:09.000 --> 24:11.233
FRONT OF CONGRESS, HR ONE, S1,

24:11.300 --> 24:15.200
JOHN LEWIS FOR -- THOSE HAVE TO

24:15.266 --> 24:15.900
GET PAST.

24:15.966 --> 24:17.733
IF THEY DON'T GET PASSED, IF WE

24:17.800 --> 24:20.300
DO NOT SECURE OUR RIGHT TO VOTE.

24:20.366 --> 24:20.866
>> Bill: BECAUSE THEY AREN'T

24:20.933 --> 24:23.000
GOING TO GET PAST, THEY DON'T

24:23.066 --> 24:25.533
EVEN HAVE 50 VOTES.

24:25.600 --> 24:30.200
>> THEY DON'T HAVE 50.

24:30.266 --> 24:32.133
>> Bill: YOU NEED 60.

24:32.200 --> 24:33.266
>> RIGHT NOW JOE MANCHIN AND

24:33.333 --> 24:35.433
KYRSTEN SINEMA -- BY THE WAY,

24:35.500 --> 24:38.666
SHE WAS ONE OF THE SPONSORS OF

24:38.733 --> 24:38.833
S1.

24:38.900 --> 24:40.566
>> Bill: SHE'S AGAINST IT NOW.

24:40.633 --> 24:41.900
>> YOU NEED 60 RIGHT NOW AND

24:41.966 --> 24:44.600
JOE MANCHIN HAS SAID I'M NOT

24:44.666 --> 24:47.566
GOING TO BREAK THE FILIBUSTER,

24:47.633 --> 24:50.700
IT'S GOING TO TAKE JOE TO JOE.

24:50.766 --> 24:51.733
JOE BIDEN IS GOING TO HAVE TO

24:51.800 --> 24:52.866
TALK TO JOE MANCHIN AND SAY WE

24:52.933 --> 24:55.566
HAVE A CHANCE HERE TO EITHER

24:55.633 --> 24:57.866
PRESERVE THE SENATE --

24:57.933 --> 24:59.533
>> Bill: YOU DON'T THINK HE'S

24:59.600 --> 25:00.366
ALREADY DONE THAT?

25:00.433 --> 25:02.800
>> NOT THE WAY IT NEEDS TO BE

25:02.866 --> 25:03.033
DONE.

25:03.100 --> 25:06.933
>> Bill: TWISTING HIS ARM?

25:07.000 --> 25:08.133
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO CONVINCE

25:08.200 --> 25:08.366
THIS --

25:08.433 --> 25:11.966
>> YES YOU CAN.

25:12.033 --> 25:13.700
>> Bill: DEMOCRATS HAVE NO

25:13.766 --> 25:14.900
ANSWERS, I'M SORRY!

25:14.966 --> 25:18.400
THEY HAVE NO GOOD ANSWERS!

25:18.466 --> 25:22.766
THAT'S YOUR ANSWER?

25:22.833 --> 25:23.333
JOE BIDEN HAS TO BE MORE

25:23.400 --> 25:26.800
PERSUASIVE IN THE ROOM?

25:26.866 --> 25:30.266
>> UNLESS YOU PUT VOTING RIGHTS

25:30.333 --> 25:32.466
IN FRONT OF THE PEOPLE AND SAY

25:32.533 --> 25:34.333
THIS DOES NOT REQUIRE THE

25:34.400 --> 25:34.866
FILIBUSTER AND REMOVE THE

25:34.933 --> 25:36.366
FILIBUSTER JUST FOR THAT, THERE

25:36.433 --> 25:39.000
MAY BE A WAY TO SAY TO

25:39.066 --> 25:41.366
JOE MANCHIN, EITHER YOU CHOOSE

25:41.433 --> 25:42.066
DEMOCRACY OR THE FILIBUSTER.

25:42.133 --> 25:44.666
>> THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE DO IN

25:44.733 --> 25:47.000
THESE UPCOMING -- BUT HERE'S THE

25:47.066 --> 25:47.200
THING.

25:47.266 --> 25:49.800
>> Bill: HE ONLY CARES ABOUT

25:49.866 --> 25:50.266
GETTING REELECTED IN

25:50.333 --> 25:50.933
WEST VIRGINIA.

25:51.000 --> 25:52.433
>> WEST VIRGINIANS RIGHT NOW ARE

25:52.500 --> 25:57.966
THRILLED BEYOND BELIEF WITH WHAT

25:58.033 --> 25:58.533
BIDEN HAS DONE WITH COVERT

25:58.600 --> 26:02.233
RELIEF AND THRILLED ABOUT

26:02.300 --> 26:03.766
INFRASTRUCTURE --

26:03.833 --> 26:05.933
>> WE SHOULD HAVE A NAME IN

26:06.000 --> 26:06.900
NORTH CAROLINA RIGHT NOW IN OUR

26:06.966 --> 26:08.033
POCKET THAT WE DROP THOSE RACES,

26:08.100 --> 26:09.366
YOU DON'T WANT TO HEAR ABOUT

26:09.433 --> 26:11.766
LONG-TERM STRATEGY.

26:11.833 --> 26:14.866
THE ONLY PATHWAY IS --

26:14.933 --> 26:17.733
>> Bill: LET'S TALK ABOUT --

26:17.800 --> 26:19.166
WE AREN'T WINNING THIS ARGUMENT.

26:19.233 --> 26:23.366
THE DEMOCRATS DID AN AUTOPSY IT

26:23.433 --> 26:24.600
SEEMS LIKE EVERY DEPARTMENT IS

26:24.666 --> 26:26.600
DOING THE AUTOPSY, IT'S ABOUT

26:26.666 --> 26:28.300
THE 2020 BOAT TO SEE WHY THEY

26:28.366 --> 26:29.666
DIDN'T TO BETTER, THEY SHOULD

26:29.733 --> 26:30.700
HAVE DONE BETTER, THEY DIDN'T

26:30.766 --> 26:31.766
WIN THE SENATE, THEY LOST ALL

26:31.833 --> 26:33.500
THE STATEHOUSES.

26:33.566 --> 26:36.300
>> THEY DID WIN THE SENATE.

26:36.366 --> 26:37.966
>> ONLY AFTER A SECOND ELECTION

26:38.033 --> 26:40.000
WHERE WE CAME IN AND FINALLY GOT

26:40.066 --> 26:43.633
THE DEMOCRATS SHIT TOGETHER SO

26:43.700 --> 26:44.266
THEY RAN ON COVERT RELIEF CHECKS

26:44.333 --> 26:47.566
DIRECT TO YOUR.

26:47.633 --> 26:49.533
>> Bill: 50/50 TO ME IS NOT

26:49.600 --> 26:49.833
WINNING IT.

26:49.900 --> 26:56.500
>> THEY LOST 12 HOUSE SEATS.

26:56.566 --> 26:58.666
>> WE PICKED UP SEATS.

26:58.733 --> 27:02.033
>> NOT AS MANY AS WE SHOULD HAVE

27:02.100 --> 27:02.266
HAD TO.

27:02.333 --> 27:04.466
>> Bill: HERE IS THE AUTOPSY

27:04.533 --> 27:05.666
FINDINGS, THREE THINGS THEY

27:05.733 --> 27:06.266
SAID.

27:06.333 --> 27:08.400
VOTERS OF COLOR NEED TO BE

27:08.466 --> 27:10.466
CONVINCED.

27:10.533 --> 27:11.633
POLLING, HUGE PROBLEM, PEOPLE

27:11.700 --> 27:13.033
DON'T TELL POLLSTERS WHAT THEY

27:13.100 --> 27:14.300
REALLY THINK ANYMORE, THEY FUCK

27:14.366 --> 27:15.300
WITH THEM.

27:15.366 --> 27:17.833
AND REPUBLICAN ATTEMPTS TO BRAND

27:17.900 --> 27:21.900
DEMOCRATS AS RADICALS WORKED.

27:21.966 --> 27:24.533
DEMOCRATS WHO LOST WERE

27:24.600 --> 27:25.400
CENTRISTS WHO NEVERTHELESS

27:25.466 --> 27:28.366
COULDN'T SHAKE THE RADICAL LABE

27:28.433 --> 27:28.566
LABEL.

27:28.633 --> 27:29.733
I TALKED A LOT ABOUT WOKENESS ON

27:29.800 --> 27:31.733
THIS SHOW, I'M NOT A FAN, I

27:31.800 --> 27:33.566
THINK IT'S AN ALBATROSS, JAMES

27:33.633 --> 27:34.866
CARVILLE WAS HERE THE OTHER WEEK

27:34.933 --> 27:35.800
SAYING THE SAME THING, DO YOU

27:35.866 --> 27:37.533
THINK IT'S AN ALBATROSS, AND IF

27:37.600 --> 27:38.366
SO HOW BIG AN ALBATROSS AROUND

27:38.433 --> 27:40.900
THEIR NECKS?

27:40.966 --> 27:42.033
>> I THINK IT'S NOT SOMETHING WE

27:42.100 --> 27:45.033
SHOULD FOCUS ON, THIS IS A

27:45.100 --> 27:46.566
FOOL'S ERRAND TO GO DOWN THAT

27:46.633 --> 27:46.766
ROAD.

27:46.833 --> 27:48.666
WE HAVE TO SELL THE FACT THAT WE

27:48.733 --> 27:49.500
HAVE POLICIES THAT HAVE BEEN

27:49.566 --> 27:51.966
PASSED AND WILL BE PASSED THAT

27:52.033 --> 27:53.300
ARE GOING TO MAKE PEOPLE HAPPY,

27:53.366 --> 27:54.666
THERE COULD HAVE JOBS AND MONEY

27:54.733 --> 27:57.200
IN THEIR POCKETS.

27:57.266 --> 27:58.433
>> Bill: PEOPLE DO PAY

27:58.500 --> 27:59.333
ATTENTION BECAUSE IT'S ON YOUR

27:59.400 --> 28:02.133
PHONE EVERY DAY.

28:02.200 --> 28:03.566
IT'S THE DRIP DRIP EFFECT.

28:03.633 --> 28:05.333
>> YOU KNOW WHY IT WORKS?

28:05.400 --> 28:07.666
THE G.O.P. IS DOING THE WOKENESS

28:07.733 --> 28:09.533
BRANDING AND WE ARE LIKE LET'S

28:09.600 --> 28:10.166
TALK ABOUT WOKENESS ALL THE

28:10.233 --> 28:12.500
FUCKING TIME.

28:12.566 --> 28:14.133
WHAT WE SHOULD DO -- THINK ABOUT

28:14.200 --> 28:15.800
IT, THE COMPLAINT IS THEY ARE

28:15.866 --> 28:18.300
TWO PC, THE OTHER SIDE IS

28:18.366 --> 28:19.166
TURNING INTO A FASCIST

28:19.233 --> 28:21.433
AUTHORITARIAN PARTY THAT IS

28:21.500 --> 28:22.100
LITERALLY MAKING OUR ELECTIONS.

28:22.166 --> 28:25.466
YOU HAVE TO TAKE THAT BRAND BAC

28:25.533 --> 28:26.366
BACK.

28:26.433 --> 28:27.433
>> Bill: THE FASCIST THING, I

28:27.500 --> 28:29.166
COULDN'T AGREE WITH YOU MORE

28:29.233 --> 28:30.200
THERE IS FASCISM A FOOT AND

28:30.266 --> 28:32.866
TRUMP DOING SOMETHING LIKE

28:32.933 --> 28:34.566
COLLUDING WITH UKRAINE WAS

28:34.633 --> 28:36.566
TERRIBLE AND WAS AN IMPEACHABLE

28:36.633 --> 28:37.366
DEFENSE.

28:37.433 --> 28:38.800
PEOPLE DON'T CARE, UKRAINE IS

28:38.866 --> 28:40.500
VERY FAR AWAY AND YOU'RE TELLING

28:40.566 --> 28:42.133

28:44.600 --> 28:47.500
THAT'S RIGHT IN MY HOME.

28:47.566 --> 28:49.900

28:49.966 --> 28:50.866
AFRAID OF OTHER SHIT, AND WE

28:50.933 --> 28:54.333

I WANT TO TELL PEOPLE THEY ARE

28:58.766 --> 29:00.233

29:00.300 --> 29:02.200
TEENAGE ABORTION STUFF BECAUSE

29:02.266 --> 29:03.600

29:03.666 --> 29:05.566
HAS BEEN FED AND WE ARE GOING TO

29:05.633 --> 29:06.900
BE LOOKING AT TURNOUT IN THIS

29:06.966 --> 29:08.066
CALIFORNIA RECALL COMING UP,

29:08.133 --> 29:09.400
GAVIN NEWSOM IS PULLING SO

29:09.466 --> 29:10.700
WELL -- DOUBLED IN NUMBER OF

29:10.766 --> 29:16.466
REPUBLICAN VOTERS TELL THE PULLS

29:16.533 --> 29:18.433
I'M SUPER EXCITED TO VOTE IN THE

29:18.500 --> 29:19.100
RECALL.

29:19.166 --> 29:20.833
WE HAVE A MASSIVE TUNED OUT

29:20.900 --> 29:21.933
COMPLACENCY ISSUE ON THIS SIDE

29:22.000 --> 29:24.466
AND WE HAVE TO MATCH IT, WE HAVE

29:24.533 --> 29:25.400
TO MATCH THEIR MESSAGING.

29:25.466 --> 29:26.933
>> Bill: I HEAR THIS A LOT

29:27.000 --> 29:28.066
FROM DEMOCRATS, WE LOST BECAUSE

29:28.133 --> 29:30.000
WE DIDN'T GET OUR MESSAGE OUT.

29:30.066 --> 29:31.733
I THINK THE PROBLEM IS YOU DID.

29:31.800 --> 29:33.800
THEY HEARD YOU, THEY JUST DON'T

29:33.866 --> 29:34.033
LIKE IT.

29:34.100 --> 29:37.533
THEY HEARD YOU LOUD AND CLEAR.

29:37.600 --> 29:39.400
>> THAT'S NOT WHAT THE DATA SAYS

29:39.466 --> 29:41.800
ABOUT ANY OF THE STUPID

29:41.866 --> 29:46.700
POLICY -- THOSE POLICIES ALL

29:46.766 --> 29:47.533
PULL IN THE 60s.

29:47.600 --> 29:49.033
IF YOU'RE TALKING POLICY AND THE

29:49.100 --> 29:49.733
OTHER PARTY IS HITTING YOU ON A

29:49.800 --> 29:52.766
BRAND AND IDENTITY, IT DOESN'T

29:52.833 --> 29:57.100
MATTER IF YOU'RE JAMIE HARRISON

29:57.166 --> 29:58.533

29:58.600 --> 29:59.233
MEMBERS, YOU'RE GOING TO GET

29:59.300 --> 30:01.466
CALLED A SOCIALIST.

30:01.533 --> 30:03.800
I TELL PEOPLE I COULD MAKE AOC

30:03.866 --> 30:05.366
AND SANDERS DISAPPEAR TOMORROW

30:05.433 --> 30:08.333
AND THE G.O.P. WOULD RUN THE

30:08.400 --> 30:09.966
SAME MESSAGE, WHY?

30:10.033 --> 30:11.433
BECAUSE THEY ARE TRYING TO BRAND

30:11.500 --> 30:16.300
US, THE WHOLE DAMN THING AS A

30:16.366 --> 30:17.933
SOCIALIST PARTY BECAUSE THEY

30:20.433 --> 30:22.500
OPPOSITE OF DEMOCRATS --

30:22.566 --> 30:25.666

30:25.733 --> 30:26.333
GOOD IF THE DEMOCRATS UNDERSTOOD

30:26.400 --> 30:28.733
WITH THE ELECTORATE IS AND THEY

30:28.800 --> 30:29.033
DON'T.

30:29.100 --> 30:30.400
I DON'T THINK THEY PAY ATTENTION

30:30.466 --> 30:32.666
TO POLICY IS MUCH AS YOU THINK

30:32.733 --> 30:33.200
THEY DO.

30:33.266 --> 30:35.200

PIN OUR HOPES ON THAT THING

30:44.600 --> 30:45.933

ELECTORATE LIKE IT CARES, THEY

30:59.933 --> 31:02.400

31:02.466 --> 31:04.666
SYSTEM IS BUILT ON A FLAWED

31:04.733 --> 31:04.966
ASSUMPTION.

31:05.033 --> 31:09.333
THE G.O.P. UNDERSTANDS THE

31:09.400 --> 31:10.566
AMERICAN PUBLIC IS IN TERMS OF

31:10.633 --> 31:12.766
CIVICS AND THEY AREN'T CYNICALLY

31:12.833 --> 31:14.500
SMART, THEY ARE LAZY AS FUCK.

31:14.566 --> 31:16.233
IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT BEING BUSY,

31:16.300 --> 31:18.966
IT'S LAZY TOO.

31:19.033 --> 31:20.100
AND THE G.O.P. SPOON FEED THAT

31:35.900 --> 31:36.433
49% OF THE PEOPLE THINK IT'S A

31:36.500 --> 31:39.033
BIG PROBLEM.

31:39.100 --> 31:42.800
THIS WAS ON SOME FEED I READ IN

31:42.866 --> 31:47.100
SEATTLE, SOMEBODY ON THE SEATTLE

31:47.166 --> 31:49.166
COUNSEL PROPOSED LITERALLY

31:49.233 --> 31:52.233

31:59.433 --> 32:00.833
PROPOSED CHANGES IN THE CITY

32:00.900 --> 32:01.833
CRIMINAL CODE THAT PEOPLE WOULD

32:01.900 --> 32:03.333
NOT BE LIABLE IF THE OFFENSE

32:03.400 --> 32:06.633
THEY COMMITTED WAS LINKED TO

32:06.700 --> 32:07.300
POVERTY.

32:07.366 --> 32:09.466
THIS IS WHAT THE COUNCILPERSON

32:09.533 --> 32:11.700
ACTUALLY SAID "IN A SITUATION

32:11.766 --> 32:12.866
WHERE YOU TOOK THE SANDWICH

32:12.933 --> 32:14.300
BECAUSE YOU WERE HUNGRY AND

32:14.366 --> 32:16.500
TRYING TO MEET YOUR BASIC NEEDS,

32:16.566 --> 32:17.733
WE AS THE COMMUNITY KNOW WE

32:17.800 --> 32:19.466
SHOULD NOT PUNISH THAT, THAT

32:19.533 --> 32:23.333
CONDUCT IS EXCUSED."

32:23.400 --> 32:24.633
IT LOOKS LIKE THE DEMOCRATS HAVE

32:24.700 --> 32:27.900
NO COMMON SENSE.

32:27.966 --> 32:30.066
THIS DIDN'T PASS, IT'S NOT GOING

32:30.133 --> 32:30.833
TO PASS BUT PEOPLE READ THIS,

32:30.900 --> 32:35.633
THEY READ IT EVERY DAY.

32:35.700 --> 32:40.533
>> THERE CRAZY IS LET'S HAVE

32:40.600 --> 32:41.166
CHILDREN GET VISUALLY EXPECTED

32:41.233 --> 32:47.100

32:47.166 --> 32:47.333
VAGINA.

32:47.400 --> 32:49.766

32:49.833 --> 32:50.200
ABOUT THEIR CRAZY.

32:50.266 --> 32:52.500
>> YES YOU CAN, YOU CAN TALK

32:52.566 --> 32:52.766
ABOUT IT.

32:52.833 --> 32:54.133
>> Bill: PEOPLE HEAR IT

32:54.200 --> 32:55.533
BECAUSE THEY ARE IN THEIR OWN

32:55.600 --> 32:55.733
SILOS.

32:55.800 --> 32:57.433
>> YOU CAN BREAK THE SILOS, YOU

32:57.500 --> 32:59.833
HAVE TO BE SOPHISTICATED ABOUT

32:59.900 --> 33:02.900
IT.

33:02.966 --> 33:05.300
>> Bill: YOU THINK PEOPLE --

33:05.366 --> 33:06.666
THE ONLY PLACE WHERE PEOPLE

33:06.733 --> 33:09.766
DEBATE IS THIS SHOW.

33:09.833 --> 33:10.700

33:13.966 --> 33:15.900
DON'T.

33:15.966 --> 33:17.133
>> PSYCHOLOGICALLY, PEOPLE DON'T

33:17.200 --> 33:19.266
WANT TO SEE SHIT THAT MAKES THEM

33:19.333 --> 33:21.833
FEEL GUILTY OR PAINFUL.

33:21.900 --> 33:22.800
>> Bill: THEY DON'T WANT TO

33:22.866 --> 33:26.766
SEE SHIT THEY DON'T AGREE WITH.

33:26.833 --> 33:28.400
>> YOU HAVE TO SHOVE IT DOWN --

33:28.466 --> 33:30.466
>> Bill: SHOVE IT DOWN THEIR

33:30.533 --> 33:30.700
THROAT.

33:30.766 --> 33:32.100

36:09.133 --> 36:10.700
I WANT TO ASK YOU GUYS, YOU

36:10.766 --> 36:12.066
MENTION THIS -- I THINK HOW WE

36:12.133 --> 36:14.566
REACT TO COMING OUT OF THIS IS

36:14.633 --> 36:16.600
LOOKING LIKE A BIG LIABILITY TO

36:16.666 --> 36:17.566
THE DEMOCRATS.

36:17.633 --> 36:21.066
I THINK SOMEHOW, SOMETIMES THEIR

36:21.133 --> 36:22.300
WHOLE ATTITUDE TOWARD THIS WAS A

36:22.366 --> 36:23.000
LIABILITY, IT DEPENDS ON HOW YOU

36:23.066 --> 36:24.733
THINK ABOUT IT BUT THERE WAS A

36:24.800 --> 36:26.700
POLL RECENTLY, THIS IS GALLUP,

36:26.766 --> 36:28.700
SERIOUS POLLING SERVICE, WHICH

36:28.766 --> 36:29.933
IS BETTER ADVICE RIGHT NOW FOR

36:30.000 --> 36:31.566
PEOPLE WHO DO NOT HAVE SYMPTOMS

36:31.633 --> 36:35.066
AND ARE OTHERWISE HEALTHY?

36:35.133 --> 36:37.766
STAY HOME AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE TO

36:37.833 --> 36:38.900
AVOID CONTRACTING OR SPREADING

36:38.966 --> 36:40.633
THE VIRUS OR LEAD TO THEIR

36:40.700 --> 36:42.266
NORMAL LIVES AS MUCH AS

36:42.333 --> 36:42.833
POSSIBLE?

36:42.900 --> 36:45.866
87% OF REPUBLICANS SAID PEOPLE

36:45.933 --> 36:47.366
SHOULD STRIVE TO LEAD NORMAL

36:47.433 --> 36:52.733
LIVES, 71% OF DEMOCRATS, STAY

36:52.800 --> 36:53.166
HOME!

36:53.233 --> 36:53.533
KEEP COWERING.

36:53.600 --> 36:55.233
>> YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE

36:55.300 --> 36:58.066

HERE ALONE WALKING ON THE STREET

37:20.066 --> 37:23.900

37:26.566 --> 37:32.300
NOW YOUR MASK D SHAMING THEM.

37:32.366 --> 37:35.033
>> IT IS STUPID AND IT'S A

37:35.100 --> 37:36.266
REJECTION OF SCIENCE BECAUSE YOU

37:36.333 --> 37:37.700
CAN'T SAY ON ONE END WE'VE GOT

37:37.766 --> 37:40.800
TO LISTEN TO THE SCIENCE AND THE

37:40.866 --> 37:42.433
DATA AND A SCIENCE SAYS OKAY,

37:42.500 --> 37:43.133
YOU CAN'T GET COVID OUTSIDE AND

37:43.200 --> 37:44.633
YOU NEVER COULD AND YOU DON'T

37:44.700 --> 37:45.400
NEED A MASK ANYMORE, AND IS NOT

37:45.466 --> 37:48.400
GOING TO DO IT, YOU'RE RIGHT, IT

37:48.466 --> 37:51.700
COULD BE A LIABILITY.

37:51.766 --> 37:52.766
MY ORGANIZATION IS GOING TO

37:52.833 --> 37:59.333
HAMMER THOSE G.O.P. PEOPLE WHO

37:59.400 --> 38:00.433

38:00.500 --> 38:01.000
MISINFORMATION HUNDREDS OF

38:01.066 --> 38:03.466
THOUSANDS OF CITIZENS.

38:03.533 --> 38:04.700
THEY ARE GOING TO DO THEIR

38:04.766 --> 38:07.266
THING, ARE WE GOING TO COME BACK

38:07.333 --> 38:08.666
WITH AN ALTERNATIVE FRAME THAT

38:08.733 --> 38:11.833
IS AGGRESSIVE AND OFFENSIVE, NOT

38:11.900 --> 38:13.033
DEBATING ON THEIR TERMS.

38:13.100 --> 38:15.466
THEY WANT TO TALK ABOUT MASK

38:15.533 --> 38:17.500
WEARING, WERE GOING TO TALK

38:17.566 --> 38:18.133
ABOUT YOUR BULLSHIT MANAGEMENT

38:18.200 --> 38:22.433
OF THIS PANDEMIC.

38:26.600 --> 38:27.766
WE JUST SAY IT'S OVER?

38:27.833 --> 38:30.366
I KNOW IT WAS GREAT FUN TO HAVE

38:30.433 --> 38:30.666
A PANDEMIC.

38:30.733 --> 38:33.533
>> THE LAST TIME I WAS HERE WAS

38:33.600 --> 38:34.033
A YEAR, LITERALLY.

38:34.100 --> 38:35.233
>> Bill: IT'S OVER, LIKE YOU

38:35.300 --> 38:36.833
SAID AT THE BEGINNING OF THE

38:36.900 --> 38:37.566
SHOW, WE SHOULD BE CLOSER

38:37.633 --> 38:38.500
TOGETHER.

38:38.566 --> 38:39.533
I WATCH THE BASKETBALL PLAYOFFS

38:39.600 --> 38:40.933
NOW, MOST OF THE PEOPLE ARE IN

38:41.000 --> 38:42.466
THE STANDS, NOT WEARING MASKS

38:42.533 --> 38:43.900
AND APPARENTLY THERE IS NO

38:43.966 --> 38:45.100
SUPER-SPREADER EVENT THAT IS

38:45.166 --> 38:46.333
COMING OUT OF THAT AND YET I SEE

38:46.400 --> 38:47.700
THE PLAYERS ARE PLAYING WITHOUT

38:47.766 --> 38:49.200
MASKS, THEY GO ON THE BENCH, THE

38:49.266 --> 38:52.733
COACH IS A MASK ON, WHY?

38:52.800 --> 38:56.933
IT'S STUPID, INCONSISTENT, ASS

38:57.000 --> 38:58.500
COVERING.

38:58.566 --> 39:01.100
>> IF YOU HAD YOUR VACCINATION,

39:01.166 --> 39:02.933
IF YOU'VE BEEN VACCINATED,

39:03.000 --> 39:04.700
THAT'S IT, THAT'S THE IDEA.

39:04.766 --> 39:05.633
IF YOU HAVEN'T BEEN VACCINATED,

39:05.700 --> 39:08.766
THEN THAT'S NOT RIGHT.

39:08.833 --> 39:10.733
I DON'T WANT YOU WALKING AROUND.

39:10.800 --> 39:11.266
>> Bill: BUT YOU HAVE BEEN

39:11.333 --> 39:13.466
VACCINATED.

39:13.533 --> 39:15.166
>> YES!

39:15.233 --> 39:17.466
>> Bill: SO DON'T BE AFRAID OF

39:17.533 --> 39:17.966
THE PERSON WHO ISN'T!

39:18.033 --> 39:21.500
>> I'M NOT AFRAID, I'M WORRIED

39:21.566 --> 39:23.033
THAT THAT PERSON IS GOING TO

39:23.100 --> 39:24.166
SPREAD SOMETHING TO SOMEBODY

39:24.233 --> 39:24.366
ELSE.

39:24.433 --> 39:25.566
>> Bill: SOMEBODY IS ALWAYS

39:25.633 --> 39:27.300
GOING TO SPREAD SOMETHING,

39:27.366 --> 39:28.933
EVERYTHING IN LIFE IS A RISK.

39:29.000 --> 39:32.933
>> IT'S TOTALLY FINE BUT I DO

39:33.000 --> 39:35.566
THINK IT'S WORTH ASKING THEM

39:35.633 --> 39:37.333
BECAUSE -- YOU ALWAYS HAVE THESE

39:37.400 --> 39:38.900
PEOPLE I DIDN'T GET THE VACCINE,

39:38.966 --> 39:40.333
THAT'S COOL, DO YOU HAPPEN TO

39:40.400 --> 39:40.900
KNOW IF YOU HAVEN'T KILLED

39:40.966 --> 39:42.866
ANYBODY YET?

39:42.933 --> 39:44.600
>> Bill: YOU KNOW WHAT ALSO

39:44.666 --> 39:47.366
KILLED PEOPLE?

39:47.433 --> 39:48.300
NOBODY IN THE HEALTH

39:48.366 --> 39:52.466
HIERARCHY -- NOBODY IN THE

39:52.533 --> 39:53.866
HEALTH HIERARCHY EVEN SUGGESTED

39:53.933 --> 39:54.500
TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE THAT THE

39:54.566 --> 39:57.666
BEST WAY TO STAY AWAY FROM A BAD

39:57.733 --> 39:59.000
OUTCOME WAS THIS VIRUS WAS TO

39:59.066 --> 40:01.866
GET YOURSELF IN BETTER PHYSICAL

40:01.933 --> 40:02.066
SHAPE.

40:02.133 --> 40:04.400
THEY NEVER SUGGESTED THAT.

40:04.466 --> 40:08.133
THAT IS MOSTLY WHAT KILLS YOU.

40:08.200 --> 40:11.333
>> IN THE MIDST OF A PANDEMIC

40:11.400 --> 40:12.566
LET'S SPREADING, AM I GOING TO

40:12.633 --> 40:14.700
LOSE 50 POUNDS?

40:14.766 --> 40:15.266
NO.

40:15.333 --> 40:17.533
>> Bill: ANYONE COULD DO.

40:17.600 --> 40:20.900
>> NOT AND THREE, FOUR MONTHS?

40:20.966 --> 40:22.000
>> Bill: IT LASTED OVER A

40:22.066 --> 40:22.200
YEAR.

40:22.266 --> 40:23.733
>> AND I LOST 40 POUNDS, I'M

40:23.800 --> 40:27.233
PROUD TO SAY.

40:27.300 --> 40:29.633
I MIGHT AS WELL BRAG, RIGHT?

40:29.700 --> 40:31.533
>> Bill: 78% OF THE PEOPLE WHO

40:31.600 --> 40:33.566
DIED WERE OPIATES.

40:33.633 --> 40:35.300
>> THAT IS WHY I HID IN MY HOUSE

40:35.366 --> 40:37.833
UNTIL I GOT VACCINES AND NOW I'M

40:37.900 --> 40:41.933
OUT AND I'M WILLING TO KISS YOU.

40:42.000 --> 40:42.833
I WILL ROLL OFF A JOINT WITH

40:42.900 --> 40:48.733
YOU, I'M TOTALLY GOOD.

40:48.800 --> 40:53.100
[LAUGHTER]

40:53.166 --> 40:55.866
NO POT IN THE GREEN ROOM.

40:55.933 --> 40:57.266

40:57.333 --> 40:59.300
BETTER, NOW WE ARE KISSING AND

40:59.366 --> 40:59.600
SMOKING POT.

40:59.666 --> 41:02.333
>> ARE YOU GOING TO USE ANY OF

41:02.400 --> 41:03.666
THOSE LINES?

41:03.733 --> 41:06.833
I THINK THEY'LL WORK.

41:06.900 --> 41:08.500
>> Bill: SPEAKING OF THAT, WHY

41:08.566 --> 41:11.266
WASN'T THERE A BABY-BOOM DURING

41:11.333 --> 41:13.333
THIS PANDEMIC?

41:13.400 --> 41:15.100
YOU WOULD THINK PEOPLE LOCKED UP

41:15.166 --> 41:16.700
FOR A YEAR -- SOMETIMES IT'S

41:16.766 --> 41:20.700
JUST A NIGHT, A BABY-BOOM, WHY

41:20.766 --> 41:23.933
WASN'T THERE A BABY-BOOM?

41:24.000 --> 41:25.466
>> YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT A

41:25.533 --> 41:27.100
DISEASE, THINK ABOUT THIS FOR A

41:27.166 --> 41:28.066
SECOND.

41:28.133 --> 41:30.033
IN 1962 YOU HAD THE

41:30.100 --> 41:30.600
CUBAN MISSILE CRISIS, PEOPLE

41:30.666 --> 41:31.566
WERE FRIGHTENED TO DEATH THAT WE

41:31.633 --> 41:33.100
WERE ALL GOING TO GO UP IN

41:33.166 --> 41:34.133
SMOKE, THERE WAS A HUGE

41:34.200 --> 41:37.933
BABY-BOOM AFTER THAT.

41:38.000 --> 41:40.033
BUT IF YOU DIDN'T GET KILLED BY

41:40.100 --> 41:44.733
THE MISSILE, YOU STARTED FUCKIN

41:44.800 --> 41:45.066
FUCKING.

41:47.300 --> 41:50.100
GET CLOSE TO SOMEBODY, YOU

41:50.166 --> 41:54.033
MIGHT -- IT MIGHT BE THE DEATH

41:54.100 --> 41:55.866
FUCK.

41:55.933 --> 41:56.900
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

41:56.966 --> 41:57.766

41:57.833 --> 42:01.633
PEOPLE WHO ARE QUARANTINED!

42:01.700 --> 42:03.266
>> I'M GOING TO TELL YOU THAT

42:03.333 --> 42:04.266
GOD'S HONEST TRUTH HERE BECAUSE

42:04.333 --> 42:05.366
I ALWAYS DO THAT FOR THE DUDES

42:05.433 --> 42:09.633
WHEN I HANG OUT WITH THEM.

42:09.700 --> 42:12.200
WE, US MARRIED WOMEN OF AMERICA,

42:12.266 --> 42:13.233
MIGHT'VE PRETENDED TO BE A

42:13.300 --> 42:15.300
LITTLE BIT MORE FREE OF KISSING

42:15.366 --> 42:16.533
AND TOUCHING OUR HUSBANDS SO WE

42:16.600 --> 42:18.300
COULD TAKE A WHOLE YEAR OFF OF

42:18.366 --> 42:19.166
DEALING WITH THEIR SHIT, THAT'S

42:19.233 --> 42:23.433
PROBABLY AT.

42:23.500 --> 42:25.000
>> Bill: I THINK THAT'S

42:25.066 --> 42:26.233
CLOSER -- FUCK YOU, I DIDN'T

42:26.300 --> 42:28.566
WANT TO TALK TO YOU.

42:28.633 --> 42:31.100
I THINK THAT'S --

42:31.166 --> 42:35.866
>> IT DOESN'T GET BETTER.

42:35.933 --> 42:39.133
>> Bill: SERIOUS ISSUE THIS

42:39.200 --> 42:39.633
WEEK, A LOT OF LIBERAL

42:39.700 --> 42:41.800
PRINCIPLES ARE BEING ARE BEING

42:41.866 --> 42:44.066
KILLED BY LIBERALS.

42:44.133 --> 42:46.033
WE ARE TALKING ABOUT ISRAEL ON

42:46.100 --> 42:47.466
THIS SHOW, THAT USED TO BE A

42:47.533 --> 42:49.200
PRETTY STAUNCH LIBERAL THING TO

42:49.266 --> 42:51.566
DEFEND THE ONLY DEMOCRACY IN THE

42:51.633 --> 42:53.433
MIDDLE EAST.

42:53.500 --> 42:56.933
FREE SPEECH.

42:57.000 --> 42:58.633
THE ACLU, THE ACLU IS TO FREE

42:58.700 --> 43:02.266
SPEECH WITH THE NRA IS THE GUNS,

43:02.333 --> 43:04.433
RIGHT?

43:04.500 --> 43:06.300
IS THE LAST LINE OF DEFENSE.

43:06.366 --> 43:09.000
>> AND DOMINATED BY IDEOLOGICAL

43:09.066 --> 43:10.666
PURITY, WE ARE AS IDEOLOGICALLY

43:10.733 --> 43:12.633
RIGID ON THE LEFT OF THE

43:12.700 --> 43:13.200
FIRST AMENDMENT, I MYSELF

43:13.266 --> 43:14.700
INCLUDED -- I WAS THINKING ABOUT

43:14.766 --> 43:16.866
THIS, AS THEY ARE TO THE

43:16.933 --> 43:18.400
SECOND AMENDMENT, IT'S AN

43:18.466 --> 43:18.866
ABSOLUTIST COMMITMENT.

43:18.933 --> 43:21.233
>> Bill: IT'S NOT ANYMORE,

43:21.300 --> 43:21.833
THAT IS THE PROBLEM.

43:21.900 --> 43:24.633
THE ACLU NOW IS WOKE.

43:24.700 --> 43:28.300
DAVID GOLDBERGER WHO WAS ONE OF

43:28.366 --> 43:30.266
THEIR ICONS, HE'S THE GUY WHO

43:30.333 --> 43:32.066
DEFENDED THE NAZIS MARCHING,

43:32.133 --> 43:35.966
SAID I GET THE SENSE IT WAS

43:36.033 --> 43:40.100
IMPORTANT FOR ACLU STAFF TO

43:40.166 --> 43:40.833
IDENTIFY WITH PROGRESSIVE CAUSES

43:40.900 --> 43:42.900
MORE THAN TO STAND ON LIBERAL

43:42.966 --> 43:44.666
PRINCIPLES.

43:44.733 --> 43:45.400
LIBERALS ARE LEAVING THE

43:45.466 --> 43:46.433
FIRST AMENDMENT BEHIND AND I

43:46.500 --> 43:48.600
THINK THIS IS A GENERATIONAL

43:48.666 --> 43:48.833
THING.

43:48.900 --> 43:50.566
I THINK THE YOUNGER GENERATIONS

43:50.633 --> 43:54.833
ARE FRAGILE AND THEY THINK BEING

43:54.900 --> 43:55.466
INSULTED OR HAVING YOUR FEELINGS

43:55.533 --> 43:59.000
HURT BY WORDS IS MORE IMPORTANT

43:59.066 --> 44:03.100
THAN FREE SPEECH.

44:03.166 --> 44:04.600
>> YOU HAVE TO FIND THAT NEAT

44:04.666 --> 44:06.566
LINE BETWEEN FREE SPEECH AND

44:06.633 --> 44:09.700
SPEECH THAT LEADS TO VIOLENCE.

44:09.766 --> 44:14.100
YOU DEFEND FREE SPEECH.

44:14.166 --> 44:15.300
AS LONG AS IT DOESN'T --

44:15.366 --> 44:17.466
>> Bill: YOU CAN SAY LEAD

44:17.533 --> 44:19.233
TO -- THAT IS A VERY SLIPPERY

44:19.300 --> 44:19.566
SLOPE.

44:19.633 --> 44:21.833
THAT HAS NOT BEEN THE DEFINITION

44:21.900 --> 44:23.500
BEFORE.

44:23.566 --> 44:24.866
HATE SPEECH, WE ALL HATE IT BUT

44:24.933 --> 44:27.000
THAT WAS THE WHOLE POINT OF THE

44:27.066 --> 44:29.933
FIRST AMENDMENT AND THE ACLU.

44:30.033 --> 44:30.800
>> YOU SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO

44:30.866 --> 44:34.700
UTTER HATE SPEECH BUT YOU CAN'T

44:34.766 --> 44:37.333
GO TO ASSEMBLE AND FREE SPEECH

44:37.400 --> 44:38.300
AND ALSO CARRY WEAPONS.

44:38.366 --> 44:39.200
>> Bill: NOT WEAPONS, NO ONE

44:39.266 --> 44:43.433
IS DEFENDING MATT.

44:43.500 --> 44:45.633
>> THEY ARE SO FAR AWAY FROM

44:45.700 --> 44:47.200
THAT.

44:47.266 --> 44:49.866
THIS YOUNGER GENERATION

44:49.933 --> 44:52.266
LITERALLY WILL SAY SPEECH IS A

44:52.333 --> 44:53.800
FORM OF VIOLENCE, PHYSICAL

44:53.866 --> 44:54.666
VIOLENCE.

44:54.733 --> 44:55.233
IT'S LIKE WHAT?

44:55.300 --> 44:58.266
NO, IT'S THE OPPOSITE OF

44:58.333 --> 44:59.066
VIOLENCE.

44:59.133 --> 45:00.000
IT'S NOT VIOLENCE, IT'S SPEECH.

45:00.066 --> 45:02.700
IT CAN LEAD TO VIOLENCE BUT

45:02.766 --> 45:04.900
THEY'VE CHANGED THE DEFINITION

45:04.966 --> 45:05.166
OF WORDS.

45:05.233 --> 45:08.200
VIOLENCE IS WHEN IT HURTS.

45:08.266 --> 45:11.466
>> YOU HAVE TO DEFINE WHAT IS

45:11.533 --> 45:14.033
FIRE IN THE CROWDED THEATER?

45:14.100 --> 45:17.466
YOU'RE FREE TO SAY THAT BUT THAT

45:17.533 --> 45:19.333
DIRECTLY LEADS TO SOMETHING THAT

45:19.400 --> 45:19.766
CAN BE VERY VIOLENT.

45:19.833 --> 45:21.400
>> LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING,

45:21.466 --> 45:23.933
SERIOUSLY INTERESTED.

45:24.000 --> 45:26.066
SECOND AMENDMENT, WOULD YOU IN A

45:26.133 --> 45:27.600
PERFECT WORLD CHANGE THE WORDING

45:27.666 --> 45:30.666
AROUND IN THAT A LITTLE BIT?

45:30.733 --> 45:31.166
>> Bill: ABSOLUTELY.

45:31.233 --> 45:32.466
>> THE FIRST AMENDMENT IS THE

45:32.533 --> 45:34.566
EXACT SAME THING, I AM A HUGE

45:34.633 --> 45:36.433
STAND UP FAN OF YOURS, I GREW UP

45:36.500 --> 45:37.600
CUTTING MY TEETH ON EDDIE MURPHY

45:37.666 --> 45:39.566
STAND UP WHICH IS WHY AM SO

45:39.633 --> 45:43.166
WEIRD AND PROFANE.

45:43.233 --> 45:45.600
YOU CAN FIND A WAY IF WE COULD,

45:45.666 --> 45:48.633
WHICH WE CAN'T TO AMEND THE

45:48.700 --> 45:51.266
CONSTITUTION JUST LIKE WITH THE

45:51.333 --> 45:53.266
SECOND AMENDMENT, YOU CAN HAVE A

45:53.333 --> 45:54.200
ROBUST SOCIETY, ROBUST FREE

45:54.266 --> 45:57.233
SPEECH AND STILL DISALLOW --

45:57.300 --> 45:59.866
>> Bill: YOU WANT TO AMEND THE

45:59.933 --> 46:00.833
FIRST AMENDMENT?

46:00.900 --> 46:02.100
THE FIRST AMENDMENT IS FIND THE

46:02.166 --> 46:03.600
WAY IT IS, THE SECOND AMENDMENT

46:03.666 --> 46:04.900
NEEDS IT, NOT THE FIRST.

46:04.966 --> 46:06.866
>> ON THE LEFT, IT'S AN

46:06.933 --> 46:11.500
IDEOLOGICALLY SLIPPERY SLOPE.

46:11.566 --> 46:13.266
>> IF YOU LOOK AT THE

46:13.333 --> 46:13.933
SECOND AMENDMENT CAREFULLY, IT'S

46:14.000 --> 46:15.066
ACTUALLY PRETTY GOOD THE WAY IT

46:15.133 --> 46:19.600
IS BECAUSE IT SAYS A WELL

46:19.666 --> 46:26.266
REGULATED MILITIA, THE

46:26.333 --> 46:26.700
PEOPLE'S --

46:26.766 --> 46:27.733
>> THE INSURRECTIONIST THINK

46:27.800 --> 46:34.700
THEY WERE A RE WELL REGULATED

46:34.766 --> 46:34.933
MILITIA.

46:35.000 --> 46:36.100
>> Bill: I GOT TO GO TO NEW

46:36.166 --> 46:38.366
RULES, YOU GUYS HAVE BEEN FUN.

46:38.433 --> 46:39.700
NEW RULE: WHEN JOE BIDEN VISITS

46:39.766 --> 46:40.333
THE QUEEN THIS WEEKEND, HE HAS

46:40.400 --> 46:41.100
TO BE A FRIEND AND TELL HER HER

46:41.166 --> 46:44.700
SPENDING IS OUT OF CONTROL.

46:44.766 --> 46:44.966
[LAUGHTER]

46:45.033 --> 46:45.866
WHETHER YOU LIKE THE ROYAL

46:45.933 --> 46:46.666
FAMILY OR YOU HATE THEM, YOU

46:46.733 --> 46:47.500
HAVE TO ADMIT THE QUEEN'S

46:47.566 --> 46:49.533
LIFESTYLE IS RATHER LAVISH.

46:49.600 --> 46:51.766
AND BEFORE YOU SAY YOU DON'T

46:51.833 --> 46:52.366
THINK SO THIS IS HER USING THE

46:52.433 --> 46:59.533
BATHROOM.

46:59.600 --> 47:03.000
[LAUGHTER]

47:03.066 --> 47:04.833
TWO GUYS IN THERE, THAT IS

47:04.900 --> 47:05.066
LAVISH.

47:05.133 --> 47:05.633
NEW RULE: DON'T HAVE SEX IN

47:05.700 --> 47:06.366
FRONT OF YOUR DOG.

47:06.433 --> 47:10.233
IT'S CRUEL AND CONFUSING.

47:10.300 --> 47:10.933
THE DOG'S THINKING, "WHERE'D THE

47:11.000 --> 47:11.633
BALL GO?!

47:11.700 --> 47:12.466
OH, THERE IT IS!

47:12.533 --> 47:13.100
WHERE'D THE BALL GO?!

47:13.166 --> 47:15.266
OH, THERE IT IS!

47:15.333 --> 47:16.600
WHERE'D THE BALL GO?!

47:16.666 --> 47:21.366
OH, THERE IT IS!"

47:21.433 --> 47:21.700
[LAUGHTER]

47:21.766 --> 47:22.100
[APPLAUSE]

47:22.166 --> 47:23.233
NEW RULE: THIS COUPLE IN SOUTH

47:23.300 --> 47:26.300
AFRICA WHO JUST GAVE BIRTH TO

47:26.366 --> 47:28.366
TEN BABIES HAS TO ANSWER ONE

47:28.433 --> 47:35.266
QUESTION: WHY ARE YOU SMILING?

47:35.333 --> 47:36.266
[LAUGHTER]

47:36.333 --> 47:37.100
NEW RULE: LET'S CALL WINDING

47:37.166 --> 47:39.066
COUNTRY ROADS WHAT THEY REALLY

47:39.133 --> 47:47.400
ARE: REDNECK POPULATION CONTROL.

47:47.466 --> 47:47.666
[LAUGHTER]

47:47.733 --> 47:48.800
BECAUSE EVERY TIME I DRIVE DOWN

47:48.866 --> 47:49.466
ONE, I SEE A HOMEMADE CROSS ON

47:49.533 --> 47:51.500
THE SIDE OF THE ROAD WITH NAMES

47:51.566 --> 47:52.466
LIKE "SKEETER," "DALE" AND

47:52.533 --> 47:56.433
"BETTY LOU."

47:56.500 --> 47:58.333
WINDING COUNTRY ROADS: GREAT FOR

47:58.400 --> 47:59.533
COUNTRY MUSIC SONGS; NOT GREAT

47:59.600 --> 48:08.666
FOR COUNTRY MUSIC FANS.

48:08.733 --> 48:08.966
[LAUGHTER]

48:09.033 --> 48:09.233
[APPLAUSE]

48:09.300 --> 48:10.200
NEW RULE: NOW THAT THE FDA HAS

48:10.266 --> 48:10.866
EXTENDED THE EXPIRATION DATE ON

48:10.933 --> 48:12.333
JOHNSON & JOHNSON VACCINES BY

48:12.400 --> 48:13.866
SIX WEEKS, THEY HAVE TO TAKE A

48:13.933 --> 48:14.800
LOOK AT THE COTTAGE CHEESE IN MY

48:14.866 --> 48:20.366
FRIDGE.

48:20.433 --> 48:20.633
[LAUGHTER]

48:20.700 --> 48:21.233
IT SAYS "MAY 31ST," BUT IT

48:21.300 --> 48:28.933
SMELLS FINE TO ME.

48:29.000 --> 48:29.300
[LAUGHTER]

48:29.366 --> 48:29.600
[APPLAUSE]

48:29.666 --> 48:30.766
THOUGH I'M NOT SUGGESTING ALL

48:30.833 --> 48:31.766
EXPIRATION DATES ARE BOGUS.

48:31.833 --> 48:32.900
IF THE CONDOM IN YOUR WALLET

48:32.966 --> 48:33.600
EXPIRED IN 2013, I'D THROW IT

48:33.666 --> 48:39.333
OUT.

48:39.400 --> 48:40.766
[LAUGHTER]

48:40.833 --> 48:41.133
[APPLAUSE]

48:41.200 --> 48:44.566
BECAUSE THAT'S HOW THIS

48:44.633 --> 48:50.433
HAPPENED.

48:50.500 --> 48:51.466
[LAUGHTER]

48:51.533 --> 48:51.933
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

48:52.000 --> 48:52.600
AND FINALLY, NEW RULE.

48:52.666 --> 48:54.233
FROM NOW ON WHEN JOE BIDEN VEERS

48:54.300 --> 48:55.800
OFF INTO ONE OF HIS LONG-WINDED

48:55.866 --> 48:58.233
STORIES THAT SEEM TO BE

48:58.300 --> 48:59.066
OFF-TOPIC, EVERYONE MUST REALIZE

48:59.133 --> 49:06.000
HE USUALLY DOES HAVE A POINT.

49:06.066 --> 49:10.300
>> THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE OVER

49:10.366 --> 49:11.066
50 HOW OFTEN DID YOU EVER SEE

49:11.133 --> 49:11.700
ADVERTISEMENTS ON TELEVISION

49:11.766 --> 49:12.866
WITH BLACK AND WHITE COUPLES?

49:12.933 --> 49:15.533
NOT A JOKE.

49:15.600 --> 49:17.633
I CHALLENGE YOU -- FIND TODAY,

49:17.700 --> 49:19.633
WHEN YOU TURN ON THE STATIONS --

49:19.700 --> 49:21.033
SIT ON ONE STATION FOR TWO

49:21.100 --> 49:22.700
HOURS.

49:22.766 --> 49:24.633
AND I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY

49:24.700 --> 49:27.466
COMMERCIALS YOU'LL SEE -- EIGHT

49:27.533 --> 49:29.533
TO FIVE -- TWO TO THREE OUT OF

49:29.600 --> 49:30.533
FIVE HAVE MIXED-RACE COUPLES IN

49:30.600 --> 49:37.333
THEM.

49:37.400 --> 49:40.933
[LAUGHTER]

49:41.000 --> 49:44.166
>> Bill: I'M GONNA TELL YOU.

49:44.233 --> 49:44.866
I KNOW, IT SOUNDS KIND

49:44.933 --> 49:45.800
OF OUT OF LEFT FIELD, BUT

49:45.866 --> 49:46.400
ACTUALLY UNCLE JOE IS POINTING

49:46.466 --> 49:47.900
LIBERALS TOWARDS SOMETHING THEY

49:47.966 --> 49:49.200
NEED TO BE MORE AWARE OF: THEY

49:49.266 --> 49:50.033
HAVE A BAD CASE OF

49:50.100 --> 49:51.566
PROGRESSOPHOBIA.

49:51.633 --> 49:52.666
THAT'S THE PHRASE COINED BY

49:52.733 --> 49:54.333
STEVEN PINKER TO DESCRIBE A

49:54.400 --> 49:55.633
BRAIN DISORDER THAT STRIKES

49:55.700 --> 49:56.633
LIBERALS AND MAKES THEM

49:56.700 --> 49:57.700
INCAPABLE OF RECOGNIZING

49:57.766 --> 50:01.266
PROGRESS.

50:01.333 --> 50:04.633
IT'S LIKE SITUATIONAL BLINDNESS,

50:04.700 --> 50:06.800
ONLY WHAT YOU CAN'T SEE IS THAT

50:06.866 --> 50:09.066
YOUR DORM IN 2021 IS BETTER THAN

50:09.133 --> 50:13.200
THE SOUTH BEFORE THE CIVIL WAR.

50:13.266 --> 50:14.866
[APPLAUSE]

50:14.933 --> 50:16.833
IF YOU THINK AMERICA IS MORE

50:16.900 --> 50:18.233
RACIST NOW THAN EVER, MORE

50:18.300 --> 50:19.800
SEXIST THAN BEFORE WOMEN COULD

50:19.866 --> 50:20.733
VOTE AND MORE HOMOPHOBIC THAN

50:20.800 --> 50:24.300
WHEN BLOW JOBS WERE A FELONY,

50:24.366 --> 50:25.566
YOU HAVE PROGRESSOPHOBIA AND

50:25.633 --> 50:26.533
SHOULD ADJUST YOUR MASK, BECAUSE

50:26.600 --> 50:32.966
IT'S COVERING YOUR EYES.

50:33.033 --> 50:34.200
[APPLAUSE]

50:34.266 --> 50:35.700
BEFORE 2012, EVERY TIME GAY

50:35.766 --> 50:38.000
MARRIAGE WAS PUT BEFORE A

50:38.066 --> 50:39.066
STATE'S VOTERS, IT LOST: 35

50:39.133 --> 50:40.966
TIMES IN A ROW.

50:41.033 --> 50:41.766
NOW IT'S THE LAW OF THE LAND IN

50:41.833 --> 50:43.500
EVERY STATE.

50:43.566 --> 50:45.466
EVEN HALF OF REPUBLICANS ARE FOR

50:45.533 --> 50:46.500
IT; THE OTHER HALF ARE FOR

50:46.566 --> 50:52.533
CLOSETED GAY SEX.

50:52.600 --> 50:52.800
