WEBVTT

01:26.347 --> 01:28.941
Know what I want to do?

01:29.017 --> 01:30.279
Yeah.

01:30.351 --> 01:32.319
What do I want to do?

01:32.387 --> 01:35.049
You want to fuck me.

01:35.123 --> 01:37.648
But you can't fuck me.

01:37.725 --> 01:39.124
Why not?

01:39.194 --> 01:41.594
You know why.

01:41.663 --> 01:43.290
'Cause you're a virgin?

01:43.364 --> 01:45.298
'Cause I don't want no baby.

01:46.601 --> 01:49.627
You think I want a baby?

01:49.704 --> 01:53.299
With me, you don't have to worry
about that kind of shit.

01:53.374 --> 01:55.103
Why is that?

01:55.176 --> 01:57.303
'Cause I like you.

01:57.378 --> 01:59.209
I think you're beautiful...

02:00.281 --> 02:02.909
And I think if we fucked, you'd love it.

02:03.952 --> 02:05.647
You wouldn't believe it.

02:07.121 --> 02:08.884
I wouldn't believe it?

02:10.158 --> 02:13.616
I don't know, I just think
you would love it, that's all.

02:14.896 --> 02:18.263
I don't know. I'm scared that things would change...

02:18.333 --> 02:19.823
between us.

02:19.901 --> 02:22.802
What things? Nothing's going to change.

02:25.673 --> 02:28.039
I just want to make you happy, that's all.

02:41.623 --> 02:43.420
You know it won't hurt.

02:45.827 --> 02:47.886
I'll be gentle, I promise.

02:50.231 --> 02:51.892
Do you care about me?

02:53.501 --> 02:55.230
Of course I do.

03:57.765 --> 04:00.290
Virgins. I love them.

04:00.368 --> 04:01.494
No diseases,

04:01.569 --> 04:04.538
no loose-as-a-goose pussy, no skank,

04:04.605 --> 04:06.004
no nothing.

04:06.074 --> 04:07.837
Just pure pleasure.

04:10.912 --> 04:12.140
Wait...

04:13.848 --> 04:15.145
That hurts.

05:58.886 --> 06:00.979
- What's up, bitch?
- Shit, yo.

06:01.055 --> 06:02.454
- What happened?
- Guess.

06:02.523 --> 06:04.013
You fucked her?

06:04.091 --> 06:07.083
I knew you fucked her. I sat here for like two hours.

06:07.161 --> 06:09.061
She was 12, you hit that shit up.

06:09.130 --> 06:12.998
Well, who I am? I'm the motherfucking virgin surgeon.

06:13.067 --> 06:14.534
How was that shit, yo?

06:14.602 --> 06:17.765
Oh, my God, so good. That girl can fuck.

06:17.839 --> 06:19.704
Word, she can fuck, yo?

06:19.774 --> 06:22.504
Hells, yeah! Halfway through, I'm thinking about...

06:22.577 --> 06:26.035
"This girl's no virgin.
No virgin can fuck like this."

06:26.113 --> 06:27.808
You sure she's a virgin?

06:29.083 --> 06:31.142
Hell, yeah. That bitch was bleeding, dude.

06:31.219 --> 06:32.982
When I first put it in,

06:33.054 --> 06:36.182
she all screamed all loud, and then like...

06:36.257 --> 06:39.954
I think I saw her bite down
on her pillow, but I don't know.

06:40.027 --> 06:42.154
- How long did it take?
- Did what take?

06:42.230 --> 06:44.095
How long you fuck her for?

06:44.165 --> 06:46.656
Well, you know, it took me 15 minutes

06:46.734 --> 06:48.531
to talk her into it and everything.

06:48.603 --> 06:51.333
It took a little longer than I expected.

06:51.405 --> 06:54.704
But once it was on, we fucked
for a good half an hour.

06:54.775 --> 06:57.608
I had to keep taking it out and putting it back in.

06:58.646 --> 07:01.376
It hurt the first time.
Didn't want to come too quick.

07:01.449 --> 07:03.076
Did her puss stink?

07:03.150 --> 07:04.208
Take a whiff.

07:05.620 --> 07:07.417
Mmm... Butterscotch, yo.

07:07.488 --> 07:08.785
That's the best.

07:10.224 --> 07:12.192
That bitch was so clean, dude.

07:12.260 --> 07:13.192
Word?

07:13.261 --> 07:15.695
You could tell she took care of herself.

07:15.763 --> 07:16.923
How?

07:16.998 --> 07:18.795
'Cause she, like, had all these like...

07:18.866 --> 07:21.664
powders and creams in her bathroom.

07:21.736 --> 07:23.226
Let me smell that shit again.

07:24.805 --> 07:27.365
I'm telling you, man, that's why I love virgins.

07:27.441 --> 07:28.669
They're the best.

07:28.743 --> 07:30.233
Purity, man.

07:30.311 --> 07:32.108
- You know what else?
- What?

07:32.179 --> 07:34.170
You can tell she just entered puberty.

07:34.248 --> 07:35.180
How?

07:35.249 --> 07:38.446
'Cause I was flipping through
this picture book of her family.

07:38.519 --> 07:42.046
And there was this picture
of her painting Easter eggs.

07:42.123 --> 07:45.581
And I was like, "Damn, you were
pretty cute when you were little."

07:47.962 --> 07:50.055
All right? So, like, she was all like...

07:50.131 --> 07:52.531
"That picture was taken less than a year ago.

07:52.600 --> 07:54.329
I look younger without makeup."

07:55.603 --> 07:56.831
That's a good one.

07:58.406 --> 08:01.170
So I was like, "Shit, this girl's a baby."

08:01.242 --> 08:02.903
Then I was like, "Oh, shit..."

08:02.977 --> 08:06.674
that turns me on. I want to fuck this baby girl."

08:06.747 --> 08:08.738
Fucking perverted bastard, I swear.

08:08.816 --> 08:10.249
I'm tellin' you, Cas,

08:10.318 --> 08:11.785
I'm getting addicted to this shit.

08:11.852 --> 08:13.376
To what, virgins?

08:13.454 --> 08:16.252
It's all I think about now.

08:16.324 --> 08:18.258
Having complex fantasies and shit.

08:18.326 --> 08:21.193
- What do you mean?
- Like going all out.

08:21.262 --> 08:23.856
You mean, like fucking two virgins at once?

08:23.931 --> 08:26.798
That would be kinda sweet, but I mean like...

08:26.867 --> 08:29.131
when I was fucking her, right...

08:29.203 --> 08:32.639
I kept thinking how much
I wanted to put it in her ass.

08:32.707 --> 08:35.039
She'd probably smash you in the grille, kid.

08:35.109 --> 08:38.044
I don't know about that. She was pretty into it.

08:39.213 --> 08:40.703
What do you want to do?

08:40.781 --> 08:43.113
Get another 40. Smoke a blunt or some shit.

08:43.184 --> 08:45.448
- You hungry?
- I'm fucking starving, yo.

08:45.519 --> 08:47.987
Wait up a sec. I'm taking a piss.

08:48.055 --> 08:49.852
Right up on this piece.

08:49.924 --> 08:52.051
Hey, let's go to Paul's house.

08:52.126 --> 08:53.957
Paul, what for? That guy's a dick.

08:54.028 --> 08:55.518
Yeah, but he always got food.

08:55.596 --> 08:57.826
He got them microwave burrito things, you know?

08:57.898 --> 08:59.593
Think he's got any herb on him?

08:59.667 --> 09:02.636
He quit dealing, but I'm sure he'll smoke us out.

09:02.703 --> 09:05.263
- You think?
- Probably.

09:07.608 --> 09:09.576
He lives on 76th, right?

09:09.644 --> 09:11.305
78th.

09:12.480 --> 09:14.038
Let's be ghosts, man.

09:15.549 --> 09:17.779
Hey, Telly, she suck your dick, man?

09:17.852 --> 09:20.912
A little bit, but I really didn't want her to.

09:20.988 --> 09:22.387
Why not, man?

09:22.456 --> 09:25.118
Having a virgin suck your dick, that's so basic, man.

09:25.192 --> 09:27.126
It's simple. It's easy.

09:27.194 --> 09:29.685
But like, if you deflower a girl, man...

09:29.764 --> 09:30.890
You're the man!

09:30.965 --> 09:32.990
No one can ever do that again.

09:33.067 --> 09:34.967
You're the only one.

09:35.036 --> 09:37.368
No one has the power to do that again.

09:37.438 --> 09:37.927
Right.

09:38.005 --> 09:41.805
The way I see it, my outlook on the situation...

09:41.876 --> 09:42.876
Mr. Wizard.

09:42.943 --> 09:44.843
It's like getting fame, you know?

09:44.912 --> 09:47.039
Say you was to die tomorrow, right?

09:47.114 --> 09:48.809
50 years from now,

09:48.883 --> 09:51.374
all the virgins you ever fucked will remember you.

09:51.452 --> 09:53.511
They'll tell their grand kids about that shit.

09:53.587 --> 09:55.953
"That Telly, he sure was good in the sack."

09:57.091 --> 09:58.388
You thirsty?

09:58.459 --> 10:00.723
Hells, yeah. I'm fucking dehydrated.

10:00.795 --> 10:01.795
You got any money?

10:01.862 --> 10:03.921
Three pennies and a ball of lint, kid.

10:03.998 --> 10:05.522
You down with the boost?

10:05.599 --> 10:06.531
True.

10:06.600 --> 10:08.727
Chill a second.

10:26.954 --> 10:28.387
You happen to have diss digg?

10:28.456 --> 10:29.650
What?

10:29.724 --> 10:32.249
Diss digg. I'm curious, do you have it?

10:32.326 --> 10:33.793
What is "diss digg"?

10:33.861 --> 10:35.590
Diss digg.

10:35.663 --> 10:36.663
What are you saying?

10:36.731 --> 10:38.892
Diss digg here. Do you have it?

10:38.966 --> 10:39.966
What?

10:40.000 --> 10:42.992
Diss digg. Diss digg.

10:43.070 --> 10:46.039
I don't... I don't understand you.

10:46.107 --> 10:48.598
A'ight, one last time. Do you have diss digg?

10:48.676 --> 10:50.234
What you say, diss digg?

10:50.311 --> 10:51.903
He said, "this dick," motherfucker.

10:51.979 --> 10:54.174
Don't you understand English?

11:03.824 --> 11:06.452
Stupid fuck boys. Fuck you.

11:24.078 --> 11:25.511
What's up?

11:25.579 --> 11:27.570
- It's Telly.
- You like peaches?

11:27.648 --> 11:30.981
It's Telly, man. Open up.

11:47.968 --> 11:49.526
Yo, yo!

11:53.374 --> 11:55.103
What's up? What's going on?

11:55.176 --> 11:56.973
What's up?

12:08.489 --> 12:10.047
Shit.

12:10.491 --> 12:13.051
What's all this shit, man?

12:13.127 --> 12:15.721
Fuckin' up our crib.

12:15.796 --> 12:16.660
Fuck the crib.

12:16.730 --> 12:19.324
Move the fuck over, you bitch ass.

12:19.700 --> 12:20.792
What's going on?

12:20.868 --> 12:23.996
Nothin'. Chillin'. What y'all up to?

12:24.071 --> 12:25.368
You want a whip-it?

12:25.439 --> 12:28.237
Give me one of them shits.

12:28.309 --> 12:31.369
This balloon almost busted, so be careful.

12:34.148 --> 12:35.843
This video is phat.

12:37.751 --> 12:39.719
Listen for that crack.

12:42.122 --> 12:43.817
Pop that shit.

12:46.961 --> 12:48.394
I told you, be careful.

12:54.468 --> 12:55.901
How you doin' there?

12:59.273 --> 13:03.107
You're going to be a vegetable when you're older.

13:03.177 --> 13:04.974
Fuck off.

13:05.045 --> 13:07.639
- My God. Look at his lip.
- Check it out, nigga.

13:07.681 --> 13:09.740
Shut the fuck up, bitch!

13:11.018 --> 13:13.043
Your lips are blue.

13:13.120 --> 13:15.554
Shut up! You don't even know me, nigga.

13:19.560 --> 13:22.552
Look at this kid, yo. He's like a fiend.

13:22.630 --> 13:24.723
That's why I like this shit.

13:24.798 --> 13:26.663
They wake my brain up.

13:27.735 --> 13:29.259
There's more, man.

13:29.336 --> 13:32.533
- How many people live here?
- Too many.

13:32.606 --> 13:35.507
No, only eight or nine.

13:35.576 --> 13:38.409
Where does everyone sleep? You homosexuals?

13:39.713 --> 13:42.181
No, get the fuck out of here.

13:42.249 --> 13:44.308
Everywhere. It's a flophouse, man.

13:44.385 --> 13:46.046
We're still short on the rent.

13:46.120 --> 13:49.055
If we had a faggot, he'd pay the rent.

13:49.123 --> 13:50.920
You and Casper can move in.

13:50.991 --> 13:52.856
You could share the bathtub.

13:52.927 --> 13:54.792
- I don't know about that.
- Yo, Telly...

13:54.862 --> 13:56.386
Jenny says, "What's up?"

13:56.463 --> 13:57.794
Jenny who?

13:57.865 --> 13:59.355
You know, Jenny.

13:59.433 --> 14:01.401
That pretty girl you boned last summer.

14:01.468 --> 14:04.926
I haven't seen her in forever. What's she up to?

14:06.907 --> 14:08.966
I knew he wouldn't speak to me. That dick.

14:09.043 --> 14:10.442
You still mad at him?

14:10.511 --> 14:12.308
Of course. How can I forgive him?

14:12.379 --> 14:14.939
- What did he do?
- He stole her virginity.

14:15.015 --> 14:18.473
He took it away and now it's gone forever.

14:18.552 --> 14:20.850
It's not the fact that he devirginized me,

14:20.921 --> 14:23.719
it's that he never spoke to me again.

14:23.791 --> 14:26.658
He talked all this bullshit and then just broke out.

14:26.727 --> 14:31.130
But he was all like, "Jenny,
I like you so much," and...

14:31.198 --> 14:33.860
"I promise, I won't use you."

14:33.934 --> 14:35.060
Same lines.

14:35.135 --> 14:36.659
He was talking mad shit.

14:36.737 --> 14:38.568
The first time is always whacked.

14:38.639 --> 14:42.370
Be glad you didn't lose your
virginity in the back seat of a car.

14:42.443 --> 14:45.435
- That's right.
- That's nothing.

14:45.512 --> 14:49.107
I had just turned 14. With this asshole who was 18.

14:49.183 --> 14:50.980
I can't remember his name.

14:51.051 --> 14:54.987
This was at sleep away camp
with your friends and shit.

14:55.055 --> 14:57.717
We were getting it on in the bushes, around midnight.

14:57.791 --> 15:00.760
I got fucking mosquito bites all over my ass.

15:00.828 --> 15:04.264
I thought nobody knew about it,
but everyone knew the next day.

15:04.331 --> 15:06.196
- And the pain was...
- Hell, yeah!

15:06.300 --> 15:10.236
- The fucking pain! Jesus!
- That's the shit.

15:10.270 --> 15:12.568
God, the pain! The fucking pain! Jesus!

15:12.639 --> 15:14.573
You feel like you're being ripped open.

15:14.641 --> 15:17.508
You are being ripped open inside.

15:17.578 --> 15:19.637
- Did you bleed?
- No, I didn't.

15:19.713 --> 15:23.376
- You didn't bleed?
- I bled all over.

15:23.450 --> 15:25.384
On the condom, everywhere.

15:25.452 --> 15:29.115
You know what he started singing?
"Sunday, Bloody Sunday."

15:29.189 --> 15:31.234
- "Sunday, Bloody Sunday."
- That stupid fucking song.

15:31.258 --> 15:33.055
I was like, "What the hell?"

15:33.127 --> 15:35.061
I couldn't believe he did that to me.

15:35.129 --> 15:38.394
Then everyone at camp was singing
that the whole time.

15:38.465 --> 15:42.333
You know what? I have sex and I like fucking.

15:42.403 --> 15:44.132
Hell, yeah.

15:44.204 --> 15:45.865
I love sex, girl.

15:45.939 --> 15:49.102
It's the best. There's nothing better.

15:49.176 --> 15:51.406
It's the best thing, right? That's it.

15:52.212 --> 15:53.804
No, no, not sex.

15:53.881 --> 15:56.714
Foreplay. Foreplay.

15:58.952 --> 16:01.182
Hardcore pound fucking.

16:01.255 --> 16:02.984
That's the shit right there, man.

16:03.057 --> 16:05.184
That's the only way to do it.

16:05.259 --> 16:07.557
It's that boom, boom, boom.

16:09.430 --> 16:12.058
But there's a difference between making love...

16:12.132 --> 16:14.157
having sex and then fucking.

16:14.234 --> 16:15.462
Right.

16:15.536 --> 16:16.867
Making love is like...

16:16.937 --> 16:19.064
It's, like, sweet.

16:19.139 --> 16:20.902
It's real slow. Real slow.

16:20.974 --> 16:22.100
Sex is like,

16:22.176 --> 16:25.304
"All right, let's have sex.

16:25.379 --> 16:27.574
Let's go, come on."

16:28.215 --> 16:30.581
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

16:30.651 --> 16:31.777
That's the whole thing.

16:31.852 --> 16:34.582
They want you to be so kind, so gentle,

16:34.655 --> 16:37.317
like you give a fuck or something.

16:41.495 --> 16:43.053
- What's up, Jav?
- What's up?

16:43.130 --> 16:46.122
What are you doing with a cigarette?

16:46.200 --> 16:47.724
Like you care?

16:47.801 --> 16:48.825
Yeah, right.

16:50.737 --> 16:54.434
Most of the time, you just want
to be all pounding that shit.

16:54.508 --> 16:56.840
I like that part.

16:56.910 --> 16:59.504
My God! That motherfucker's the bomb.

16:59.580 --> 17:01.275
If you could just be like,

17:01.348 --> 17:03.407
"Excuse me, miss, can I borrow your hole?"

17:04.985 --> 17:07.852
"It'll only take a little bit.
I'll give it right back."

17:07.955 --> 17:10.082
- Right.
- "I'm done."

17:10.891 --> 17:13.189
But that's it. You got to take it slow.

17:13.260 --> 17:17.321
You got to be smooth.
Girls like it slow and romantic.

17:17.397 --> 17:19.763
Fuck romance. I like it hard and nasty.

17:19.833 --> 17:22.393
I've been with a lot of girls, so I know.

17:22.469 --> 17:24.300
Me too, nigga. What's up?

17:25.739 --> 17:29.835
But it depends. I was at Eric's house.

17:29.910 --> 17:31.241
Smash J was there.

17:31.311 --> 17:33.302
D.J. Flipper was there.

17:33.380 --> 17:35.644
All right? He was horny.

17:35.716 --> 17:39.049
He threw me on the bed. We started getting it on.

17:39.119 --> 17:41.986
They were in the room getting dressed.

17:42.055 --> 17:45.320
They were going to a disco. That shit was so good.

17:45.392 --> 17:47.656
He was fucking fingering me, sucking on my tits.

17:47.728 --> 17:50.060
I was like, "You go, boy."

17:50.130 --> 17:51.791
We ripped each other's hair out.

17:51.865 --> 17:54.834
We kissed so hard, our lips were busted.

17:54.902 --> 17:57.393
I was like, "Work it, boy."

17:57.471 --> 18:00.440
But y'all know why I go out with Alex, right?

18:00.507 --> 18:04.637
He has the best fucking fingers I ever had.

18:04.711 --> 18:06.975
I'm going out with him.

18:07.080 --> 18:09.480
He got it going on. That's that.

18:09.516 --> 18:11.984
That's why foreplay is better than sex.

18:12.052 --> 18:14.316
They can touch you and you're going crazy

18:14.388 --> 18:17.653
and all of a sudden, it's like,
"What the hell happened?"

18:17.724 --> 18:20.215
- Just a big disappointment.
- It's a letdown.

18:20.294 --> 18:22.956
Then it takes them either too long,

18:23.030 --> 18:24.463
or too short to come.

18:24.531 --> 18:27.261
Have you ever had someone who took forever?

18:27.334 --> 18:28.767
What, to come?

18:28.835 --> 18:31.395
Let me tell you. I was having sex with Jake,

18:31.471 --> 18:34.235
and it took my man an hour and a half.

18:34.308 --> 18:36.242
I don't have no hour and a half.

18:36.310 --> 18:38.437
No, no, no.

18:38.512 --> 18:41.413
You know what I notice, though?

18:41.481 --> 18:43.711
Bitches love to suck dick.

18:43.784 --> 18:47.185
It's like some secret hobby for them or some shit.

18:47.254 --> 18:49.017
Some freaks.

18:49.089 --> 18:51.455
All bitches, man. I know, man, I'm telling you.

18:51.525 --> 18:53.049
Casper's right.

18:53.126 --> 18:55.788
They act like they don't in front of their friends,

18:55.862 --> 18:57.261
to try to get respect.

18:57.331 --> 19:00.732
When you get them alone,
it's the first thing they go for.

19:00.801 --> 19:04.396
The girls just grab your dick, start sucking.

19:04.471 --> 19:06.837
They know they're in charge of something.

19:06.940 --> 19:08.498
Only time they feel prosperous.

19:08.542 --> 19:11.705
- I'm telling you.
- They love that shit.

19:11.778 --> 19:13.439
That's why girls live longer than guys.

19:13.513 --> 19:15.981
Sperm's got vitamin C in that shit.

19:16.049 --> 19:18.916
The shit's nutritious, right?

19:22.222 --> 19:24.190
Looking at your watch.

19:26.126 --> 19:27.593
You know what's the worst?

19:27.661 --> 19:30.494
Sucking dick. I hate sucking dick.

19:30.564 --> 19:33.829
They'll be shooting you in the eye,
and the ear and shit.

19:33.900 --> 19:36.391
And you don't know what to do.

19:37.337 --> 19:38.634
It hits that little thing...

19:38.705 --> 19:41.640
the tonsils, the esophagus, whatever the hell it is.

19:42.743 --> 19:45.906
- You don't get anything out of it.
- You'll be gagging.

19:45.979 --> 19:48.311
How much more can you bob?

19:48.382 --> 19:50.077
You don't get shit.

19:50.150 --> 19:52.243
Have you ever swallowed it before?

19:52.319 --> 19:53.877
No.

19:53.954 --> 19:55.945
Me neither.

19:56.023 --> 19:57.752
- I have.
- Of course.

20:00.327 --> 20:02.124
No, but it was like...

20:02.195 --> 20:05.631
No, it's like sweet and sour and salty butter.

20:07.334 --> 20:09.165
It's like... it's just nasty.

20:09.236 --> 20:11.363
You drink and drink and you cannot get...

20:11.438 --> 20:13.702
the taste out of your mouth.

20:13.774 --> 20:16.607
The sperm get stuck in your teeth.
They're disgusting.

20:16.677 --> 20:19.805
You gotta sit down and eat a whole real meal.

20:19.880 --> 20:21.871
All I know is that condoms suck.

20:21.948 --> 20:23.245
They don't work.

20:23.317 --> 20:26.514
They either slip off, or break,
or make your dick shrink.

20:28.021 --> 20:30.751
You got a small condom, huh?

20:30.824 --> 20:32.553
We still got to use them.

20:32.626 --> 20:34.218
I did once.

20:34.294 --> 20:36.819
Telly's the only guy I've had sex with.

20:36.897 --> 20:40.492
- I thought you had sex with A.J.
- No, we just messed around.

20:45.172 --> 20:47.072
That's the whole thing, you know?

20:47.140 --> 20:49.335
You hear of all these diseases.

20:49.409 --> 20:51.969
Disease this, disease that...

20:52.045 --> 20:55.412
fucking everyone's dying and shit.
That shit is made up.

20:55.482 --> 20:57.416
I don't know no kid with AIDS.

20:57.484 --> 21:00.078
Ain't no one I know died from that shit.

21:00.153 --> 21:02.781
Fucking, that's just some make-believe story.

21:04.525 --> 21:05.787
It's bullshit!

21:07.995 --> 21:11.089
We all going to die anyway.
I'm going to go out fucking.

21:11.165 --> 21:12.962
- Yeah.
- You know what I'm saying?

21:22.910 --> 21:25.401
One guy got tested. He was negative.

21:25.480 --> 21:27.072
This other guy...

21:27.148 --> 21:30.345
he'd fucked only two other girls,
and they were virgins,

21:30.418 --> 21:32.318
so he was safe.

21:32.387 --> 21:36.346
But then this other guy I just fucked,
which was a mistake.

21:36.424 --> 21:38.949
Heat of the moment kind of thing.

21:39.026 --> 21:41.961
But I went to the clinic last week with Jenny...

21:42.029 --> 21:44.088
to get ourselves checked, to be safe.

21:44.165 --> 21:45.598
Jenny went?

21:45.666 --> 21:48.829
She got tested with me
so that I didn't have to be alone.

21:48.903 --> 21:50.632
Word, they ask a lot of questions?

21:50.705 --> 21:52.434
Jenny...

21:52.507 --> 21:53.804
how old are you?

21:53.875 --> 21:55.001
16.

21:55.076 --> 21:57.510
How many people have you
had vaginal intercourse with?

21:57.578 --> 22:00.775
- One.
- Were you protected?

22:00.848 --> 22:01.848
No.

22:03.451 --> 22:06.079
- How old are you, honey?
- 17.

22:06.187 --> 22:08.849
How many people have
you had vaginal intercourse with?

22:08.890 --> 22:09.822
Altogether?

22:09.891 --> 22:11.620
Yes, altogether.

22:11.692 --> 22:14.820
I'd say eight. Maybe nine.

22:14.896 --> 22:17.956
How many times did you go in unprotected?

22:18.032 --> 22:19.761
Four times I went unprotected.

22:19.834 --> 22:21.358
Maybe it was three.

22:22.370 --> 22:24.338
Have you ever had anal intercourse?

22:24.405 --> 22:25.497
No.

22:28.376 --> 22:30.810
Have you ever had anal intercourse?

22:30.878 --> 22:32.140
Yeah.

22:32.213 --> 22:34.272
With how many different people?

22:39.053 --> 22:42.489
I think three, but I'm not sure.

22:42.557 --> 22:44.616
Were they wearing condoms?

22:44.692 --> 22:47.627
Yes, with two of them. Twice I didn't.

22:47.695 --> 22:48.889
I didn't...

22:48.963 --> 22:50.225
two times.

22:51.065 --> 22:54.091
We're going to draw some blood from you.

22:54.168 --> 22:56.068
Come back in seven days...

22:56.137 --> 22:59.732
and we should have the results of your tests, okay?

22:59.807 --> 23:01.638
Thanks.

23:02.310 --> 23:04.403
You see that pork fried rice store?

23:04.479 --> 23:05.411
The Chinese joint?

23:05.480 --> 23:07.607
Yeah. My cousin lives right up there.

23:07.682 --> 23:10.412
He's mad. Crazy. His name is Harmonoff.

23:12.053 --> 23:14.954
One time we went to
Special Olympics on a school trip.

23:15.022 --> 23:17.490
Seventh grade, whatever.

23:17.558 --> 23:20.220
He tried to pick up these retarded bitches.

23:20.294 --> 23:23.354
That nigga's crazy. He's still got a thing for them.

23:23.431 --> 23:25.695
He caught one dope bitch that day...

23:25.766 --> 23:27.825
she had those leg braces and shit.

23:27.902 --> 23:29.699
But she had a fat ass.

23:29.770 --> 23:31.431
You're crazy. Ruthless.

23:31.506 --> 23:35.670
He brought her into the bathroom
and fucked the shit out of her.

23:35.743 --> 23:39.179
He was telling me that the leg
braces were scratching up his shit.

23:39.247 --> 23:42.182
He hit her hard, yo. She was all drooling and shit.

23:55.730 --> 23:58.631
So, he's pretty crazy;
He'll do whatever to bust a nut.

23:58.699 --> 24:00.291
- You know?
- That's ruthless shit.

24:00.368 --> 24:04.668
He wanted to take the leg braces off,
but he was just like "Fuck it."

24:04.739 --> 24:06.730
"Let's hit this up real quick."

24:08.342 --> 24:09.809
Like quickie style.

24:13.581 --> 24:15.981

24:16.050 --> 24:18.985

24:20.454 --> 24:22.945

24:23.024 --> 24:24.958
He reminds me of my uncle.

24:25.026 --> 24:27.824

I don't think I want to be seein' him anymore.

25:03.364 --> 25:05.764
I want to date other people. I don't know.

25:05.866 --> 25:09.131
I think he's mad at me or something. But who cares?

25:09.170 --> 25:11.138
It's like, "Get off your high horse.

25:11.205 --> 25:14.436
If I want to see other guys I'll see other guys."

25:14.508 --> 25:16.135
So it's just like...

25:16.210 --> 25:18.405
I can't deal with that jealous crap.

25:18.479 --> 25:21.141
I don't know why I see him in the first place.

25:21.215 --> 25:24.651
He's a jerk! Giving me a hard time. That crap.

25:24.719 --> 25:26.949
I think I'm just gonna dump him completely.

25:27.021 --> 25:30.616
I was just tryin' to be nice,
but if he's gonna get...

25:32.226 --> 25:33.955
It must have been something I ate.

25:34.028 --> 25:35.825
Ruby, follow me.

25:35.896 --> 25:38.194
- Wish me luck.
- Good luck.

25:48.342 --> 25:49.434
Jenny...

26:09.997 --> 26:11.760
You tested negative

26:11.832 --> 26:15.268
for all sexually transmitted diseases and infections.

26:15.336 --> 26:17.065
Yes!

26:17.138 --> 26:18.605
You're clean.

26:18.673 --> 26:20.641
I can't tell you how nervous I was.

26:20.708 --> 26:22.141
I didn't sleep last night.

26:22.209 --> 26:24.609
Now you have to be careful, Ruby, okay?

26:24.679 --> 26:28.809
I want you to take these pamphlets and read them.

26:28.883 --> 26:30.714
And, Ruby, read them.

26:35.523 --> 26:38.959
Jenny, you've tested positive for the HIV virus.

26:39.026 --> 26:40.026
What?

26:40.094 --> 26:42.085
The test isn't 100% accurate.

26:42.163 --> 26:44.028
I tested positive?

26:44.098 --> 26:45.963
I'm sorry.

26:46.033 --> 26:47.933
I only had sex with Telly.

26:51.839 --> 26:54.899
I just came to keep Ruby company.

27:11.393 --> 27:12.985
Yo, I want to fuck Darcy.

27:13.061 --> 27:14.187
Who?

27:14.262 --> 27:15.773
You know Darcy. Bennie's little sister.

27:15.797 --> 27:17.162
You like her, uh-huh?

27:17.232 --> 27:19.097
Yo, I liked her for a while, yeah.

27:19.167 --> 27:20.167
Darcy, yo?

27:20.235 --> 27:23.204
She's so little, innocent and pretty.

27:23.271 --> 27:24.898
She's only 13, man.

27:24.973 --> 27:26.531
Shit.

27:26.608 --> 27:29.338
You remember the last week at the block party?

27:29.411 --> 27:32.005
She was handing out watermelon slices.

27:32.080 --> 27:36.016
I just sat across from her and started watching her.

27:36.084 --> 27:38.143
- She was eating this watermelon.
- Uh-huh.

27:38.220 --> 27:41.951
Juices just start runnin'
off her chin onto her shirt.

27:42.023 --> 27:43.201
After about three seconds, yo,

27:43.225 --> 27:46.217
I got the biggest fuckin' hard on, yo.

27:46.294 --> 27:50.094
I just wanted to take out my dick
right there and start jerking off.

27:50.165 --> 27:51.826
Shit, yo.

27:51.900 --> 27:54.562
Like at that point, and moment, like...

27:54.636 --> 27:57.104
she was like a vision of perfection.

27:57.172 --> 27:58.833
I know what you mean, yo.

27:58.907 --> 28:02.673
Like, like she represented
everything holy about a virgin.

28:02.744 --> 28:05.611
I know what you're saying. I know.

28:05.714 --> 28:07.341
She works for NASA, man.

28:07.382 --> 28:09.350
I think she promotes for them.

28:09.417 --> 28:12.147
I'm going to fuck her tonight, I swear to God.

28:12.220 --> 28:15.280
How you going to fuck two virgins in one day?

28:15.357 --> 28:18.224
That shit's got to be against the law or some shit.

28:18.293 --> 28:21.820
I'm still going to fuck her.
I'll bet you money I'll fuck her.

28:21.897 --> 28:23.694
Bet, yo.

28:33.108 --> 28:39.373

28:39.447 --> 28:42.746

See what the fellas are doing?

28:42.818 --> 28:45.878
Yeah, yeah. But I also got to run home.

28:45.954 --> 28:47.819
Yeah, yeah, that's cool. That's cool.

29:45.480 --> 29:48.005
No, I need to speak to Mom.

29:49.618 --> 29:51.347
Peter, where's Mommy?

29:52.387 --> 29:54.321
No, I can't talk to you right now.

29:56.324 --> 29:59.157
Yeah, I hear it.

30:03.932 --> 30:05.331
Just tell her that...

30:06.434 --> 30:08.629
Never mind. Just go watch television.

30:14.042 --> 30:16.010
Come on. It's gonna be okay.

30:17.245 --> 30:19.611
It's gonna be okay.

30:20.315 --> 30:23.944
I'm gonna have to tell
my little brother I'm gonna die.

30:24.019 --> 30:27.079
I can't make him his lunches any more.

30:27.155 --> 30:31.285
Come on. I mean, don't cry. We'll work it out.

30:31.359 --> 30:33.224
I only did it once.

30:46.107 --> 30:47.938
I gotta go. I gotta find Telly.

30:48.009 --> 30:49.738
Don't go anywhere, just stay with me.

30:49.811 --> 30:53.144
- No, I gotta find him.
- Then I'm coming.

30:53.214 --> 30:55.239
- No, I just gotta go.
- Jen...

30:55.817 --> 30:57.341
Jenny!

31:15.904 --> 31:17.804
- What's up, yo?
- Yo, chillin'.

31:45.200 --> 31:45.962
Hi, Mom.

31:46.034 --> 31:47.626
Hi, Telly, where you been?

31:47.702 --> 31:49.693
- What's up?
- Hi, Casper.

31:50.572 --> 31:53.473
We were just out trying to find jobs.

31:53.541 --> 31:56.339
- Any luck?
- No, no.

31:58.513 --> 32:01.277
What are you gonna do about money this summer?

32:03.952 --> 32:05.476
I don't know. Find a job.

32:05.553 --> 32:07.020
Can I borrow some money?

32:07.088 --> 32:10.182
Your dad made me promise not to give you any money

32:10.258 --> 32:11.885
until you find a job.

32:11.960 --> 32:14.622
- Then I won't need your money.
- That's right.

32:14.696 --> 32:17.096
Come on, Mom.

32:17.165 --> 32:19.156
N - O.

32:23.505 --> 32:24.972
Come on, Casper.

32:27.042 --> 32:29.510
Damn, Telly. Your little brother's getting big.

32:29.577 --> 32:31.545
Yeah, man, I know.

32:35.450 --> 32:38.010
Yo, Telly, your mom's titties are looking good.

32:38.086 --> 32:39.212
Shut the fuck up, man.

32:39.287 --> 32:40.549
Damn.

32:49.664 --> 32:51.291
Cardizems.

33:03.845 --> 33:05.608
Hey, how do these things work?

33:05.680 --> 33:08.205
How am I supposed to know?

33:10.051 --> 33:11.712
How much you gonna take?

33:11.786 --> 33:13.515
I don't know. How much you want?

33:13.588 --> 33:16.489
$10. $15's good, though.

33:26.101 --> 33:28.695
You ever take one of these
things out with your teeth?

33:28.770 --> 33:30.135
Stoops.

33:31.106 --> 33:34.075
Your girls don't bleed yet, that's why.

33:34.142 --> 33:36.736
My girls got mad flavor.

33:37.812 --> 33:39.245
Heavy flow.

33:52.594 --> 33:54.687
$15 for me. $10 for you.

33:54.762 --> 33:57.162
You cheap motherfucker, yo.

33:57.232 --> 33:58.859
But I'm supporting your ass.

33:58.933 --> 34:01.128
Thanks a lot.

34:01.202 --> 34:02.635
Thievin' bastard.

34:04.973 --> 34:06.463
The fuck outta here, cat.

34:07.909 --> 34:10.002
It's damn hot out!

34:10.078 --> 34:12.137
It's a fucking sauna in here, man.

34:13.348 --> 34:15.942
Yo, is crazy hot out.

34:16.017 --> 34:17.848
Word, yo.

34:17.919 --> 34:19.944
Shit.

34:24.125 --> 34:25.888
Come on, nigga.

34:25.960 --> 34:28.019
You think Darcy will be at NASA tonight?

34:28.096 --> 34:29.563
Yeah, probably.

34:29.631 --> 34:31.565
You got any weed around here?

34:31.633 --> 34:34.363
No. We should run by the park and pick up some.

34:34.435 --> 34:36.096
Maybe Darcy'll be there.

34:36.171 --> 34:37.763
True. True.

34:37.839 --> 34:40.273
Yo, I gotta start wearin' more hats.

34:42.844 --> 34:44.937
This is my tape, man.

34:45.013 --> 34:46.605
Hey, my hair looks busted, B.

34:46.681 --> 34:49.047
- I'm gonna get buff, B.
- You are?

34:49.117 --> 34:50.015
Hells, yeah.

34:50.084 --> 34:53.247
The other day, this short Chinese bitch
said I'd look good with muscles.

34:54.789 --> 34:58.054
I'll get mad diesel. Fuck up
any nigga that step to me.

34:59.794 --> 35:02.354
You got hairy armpits, yo. Word up.

35:02.430 --> 35:04.489
You got Buckwheat in a headlock there.

35:04.599 --> 35:05.759
You want some?

35:05.800 --> 35:07.768
Get the fuck out of here with that shit.

35:07.835 --> 35:09.769
- You fucking stink, dude.
- So?

35:09.837 --> 35:10.895
Nah, you stink.

35:10.972 --> 35:15.238
That shit gives me a rash
all over my armpits and my stomach.

35:15.310 --> 35:17.335
I like my smell. It's fuckin' natural.

35:17.412 --> 35:18.879
You still stink.

35:18.947 --> 35:20.539
Your mother stinks.

35:21.983 --> 35:24.451
These chips are stale.

35:25.920 --> 35:27.751
Look at this busted-ass nigga.

35:29.390 --> 35:31.358
That's me, nigga.

35:31.426 --> 35:32.950
Me and your bitch.

35:33.027 --> 35:34.153
Stoops.

35:35.530 --> 35:38.363
He wants to spend time together.

35:38.433 --> 35:39.957
I hardly know my old man.

35:42.370 --> 35:44.031
Shh...

35:44.105 --> 35:46.005
I'm going out for a little while.

35:46.074 --> 35:48.235
- When are you gonna be back?
- Not too late.

35:48.309 --> 35:49.970
4:30 in the morning?

35:50.044 --> 35:51.807
Not too late.

35:53.114 --> 35:56.675
You sure I can't get any money?

35:56.751 --> 36:00.346
If I had some, maybe.
Right now, I don't have a penny.

36:05.326 --> 36:07.351
All right, then. Bye.

36:16.904 --> 36:19.134
Shit.

36:48.436 --> 36:49.562
What's up, Ras?

36:49.637 --> 36:51.605
Casper.

36:53.574 --> 36:56.941
Back off of my customer there, man.

36:59.380 --> 37:01.007
Ras, you got some?

37:01.082 --> 37:02.174
Yeah, Mon.

37:02.250 --> 37:05.344
Let me check out a dime of that.

37:05.453 --> 37:06.784
Come here.

37:07.455 --> 37:09.946
I want no twigs or pebbles neither.

37:10.024 --> 37:11.924
I wouldn't do you.

37:19.233 --> 37:22.202
Check this. Good sinsemilla.

37:22.270 --> 37:23.464
Smells delicious.

37:23.538 --> 37:25.631
- I the best.
- Definitely.

37:25.707 --> 37:28.403
How about a dime of that shit?

37:28.476 --> 37:30.205
Drop it.

37:36.584 --> 37:38.211
Good looking out.

37:38.286 --> 37:39.719
Come check me out again.

37:39.787 --> 37:42.221
- See you tomorrow.
- Later, man.

37:57.438 --> 38:00.407
Yo, Paul, is Telly there?

38:00.475 --> 38:02.272
Is Telly there?

38:02.343 --> 38:03.867
This is Paul. Who's this?

38:03.978 --> 38:06.037
It's Jenny. Just tell me if Telly's there.

38:06.080 --> 38:07.274
Hello, Jenny.

38:07.348 --> 38:09.612
Wanna come upstairs and make out with me?

38:09.684 --> 38:12.209
Listen, I'm fucking serious. Where's Telly?

38:12.286 --> 38:14.254
Telly's not here.

38:14.322 --> 38:16.620
I think he went downtown with Casper.

38:19.594 --> 38:22.757
My dolly's black Lucy.

38:41.482 --> 38:44.315
Tracy's talking to another guy over there.

38:44.385 --> 38:45.943
Tracy?

38:46.020 --> 38:48.420
Whatever. She can suck my dick.

38:54.929 --> 38:55.987
What's up, nigga?

38:58.199 --> 39:00.326
What's up, dude?

39:01.636 --> 39:02.636
What's up, guy?

39:13.714 --> 39:16.512
Shut the fuck up, you four-eyed bitch!

39:50.785 --> 39:52.514
I tell you what. That body.

39:52.587 --> 39:54.350
Yeah, I'm in that piece, kid.

40:07.368 --> 40:08.835
- What's up, Harold?
- What's up?

40:10.705 --> 40:13.230
- Where you at?
- I'm right here, you know?

40:13.307 --> 40:16.401
- You going out tonight?
- Yeah, maybe NASA or some shit.

40:16.477 --> 40:18.138
Yo, word? You're on the list?

40:18.212 --> 40:20.942
Probably. But fuck that shit. I'll sneak in.

40:21.015 --> 40:23.006
I need some female vagina tonight.

40:23.084 --> 40:25.746
I had some female vagina last night.

40:26.053 --> 40:27.748
You did? All right!

40:28.189 --> 40:31.022
You want to do any pot? You got a Phillie?

40:31.092 --> 40:34.289
- Got one.
- Make a trade.

40:37.598 --> 40:39.429
You got this in the park?

40:40.635 --> 40:41.897
Break that shit up.

40:43.437 --> 40:45.029
Break it.

40:49.243 --> 40:50.870
Scrape it.

40:52.313 --> 40:54.008
Lick it.

40:56.117 --> 40:57.812
Dump it.

41:18.306 --> 41:20.001
You got it.

41:21.776 --> 41:23.676
Smoke it.

41:48.302 --> 41:50.031
What's up?

41:55.643 --> 41:57.110
Can I fuck with that?

41:57.178 --> 41:58.805
Sure.

42:05.019 --> 42:06.884
Yeah, boy.

42:12.393 --> 42:14.588
Mad hot, right?

42:14.662 --> 42:15.526
Mad hot.

42:15.596 --> 42:17.120
I want to go swimmin', kid.

42:17.198 --> 42:19.132
Word.

42:19.200 --> 42:20.565
Look at that shit, man.

42:21.702 --> 42:22.964
Gay guys.

42:23.037 --> 42:24.095
That shit is sick.

42:24.171 --> 42:25.638
Faggots!

42:25.706 --> 42:27.071
Fucking faggots!

42:27.141 --> 42:28.608
Butt pirate!

42:28.676 --> 42:29.938
Bitch ass faggot!

42:31.646 --> 42:33.580
Fuck out of here, motherfucker!

42:33.648 --> 42:35.377
Jungle fever.

42:39.286 --> 42:41.618
Fucking faggot! Bitch ass faggot!

42:47.261 --> 42:49.058
How can you hang out with Casper?

42:49.130 --> 42:51.064
That nigga's a jerk.

42:51.132 --> 42:53.726
- You think?
- Yeah, yo. I've always hated him.

42:53.801 --> 42:56.269
He used to eat glue in the seventh grade.

42:56.337 --> 42:57.827
- Still does.
- I hate him.

43:00.508 --> 43:02.999
Give me a taste of that motherfuckin' chronic, kid.

43:05.680 --> 43:07.910
This weed is mad good, yo.

43:09.216 --> 43:10.444
This your board?

43:24.032 --> 43:25.863
- Watch it.
- Sorry.

43:25.934 --> 43:28.198
Well, watch where the fuck you're skating at.

43:28.270 --> 43:30.135
- Watch where you walk, yo.
- What?

43:30.205 --> 43:32.036
- What I said, yo.
- What?

43:32.107 --> 43:33.301
Forget it, B. Nothin'.

43:33.375 --> 43:34.205
What?

43:34.276 --> 43:35.709
Whatever, yo. Just forget it.

43:35.777 --> 43:37.642
Do you want to get fucked up, motherfucker?

43:37.713 --> 43:40.238
- What's up, then?
- What do you mean?

43:40.315 --> 43:42.806
- What's up?
- What's up, motherfucker?

43:52.527 --> 43:55.496
Suck my dick. Fuckin' suck my dick.

44:03.739 --> 44:06.173
- Beat his ass, fuckers.
- Motherfucker!

44:06.241 --> 44:07.640
Punk ass motherfucker.

44:35.137 --> 44:37.128
He's out, man!

44:37.205 --> 44:39.435
Word up, that shit is out!

44:47.015 --> 44:49.575
Now get in my way, bitch!

44:49.651 --> 44:50.845
Motherfucker.

44:56.725 --> 44:58.522
Excuse me.

44:58.593 --> 45:00.891
Can I ask you a question?

45:02.564 --> 45:04.794
Can I ask you a question?

45:04.866 --> 45:07.096
I'm sorry. I don't mean to be a pest.

45:08.003 --> 45:11.097
It's just that I was looking
at you and you look upset.

45:11.940 --> 45:14.807
I like looking at you, but...

45:14.876 --> 45:17.640
but your face looks upset.

45:17.712 --> 45:19.043
So I was wondering...

45:20.081 --> 45:21.776
if I could be of any assistance.

45:22.751 --> 45:24.582
Maybe cheer you up or something?

45:24.653 --> 45:26.644
No, I'm okay, thanks.

45:26.721 --> 45:28.712
Okay?

45:28.790 --> 45:31.520
Because you don't look okay.

45:31.593 --> 45:33.788
You're a very pretty young lady.

45:33.862 --> 45:35.329
It's just...

45:35.397 --> 45:37.456
that your face looks troubled.

45:37.532 --> 45:39.523
It's just been a bad day.

45:40.135 --> 45:41.466
Miss...

45:43.004 --> 45:47.065
Would I be prying if I asked you what was wrong?

45:47.142 --> 45:49.042
Would I be prying?

45:49.110 --> 45:51.044
Everything's wrong.

45:51.112 --> 45:54.047
No, not everything.

45:54.115 --> 45:57.050
The sun is still shining.

45:57.118 --> 45:59.450
It's a beautiful day.

46:00.488 --> 46:02.353
Some things are okay, right?

46:02.457 --> 46:04.015
I guess so.

46:04.059 --> 46:05.822
Did you break up with your boyfriend?

46:05.894 --> 46:06.519
No.

46:06.595 --> 46:08.085
You in trouble with the law?

46:08.163 --> 46:09.323
No.

46:09.397 --> 46:11.331
Am I getting closer?

46:11.399 --> 46:12.399
That's better.

46:12.467 --> 46:14.662
You look like a prom queen when you smile.

46:14.736 --> 46:16.397
A glamour girl.

46:19.474 --> 46:20.964
When I was a kid...

46:22.177 --> 46:24.907
I had a crush on the prom queen.

46:24.980 --> 46:26.777
Darlene Lewis.

46:27.949 --> 46:30.509
She had a big black mole...

46:30.585 --> 46:33.053
in the middle of her face...

46:33.121 --> 46:36.113
that used to make me so excited.

46:36.191 --> 46:38.125
You look a little bit like her.

46:38.193 --> 46:40.184
Right around the cheeks and the chin.

46:40.262 --> 46:41.194
Thanks.

46:41.263 --> 46:44.721
Boy, did I have a crush on her.

46:44.799 --> 46:48.326
She was the first girl I put my tongue in her mouth.

46:50.138 --> 46:53.733
Hey, look. Whatever it is, just forget about it.

46:53.808 --> 46:57.175
Life is too short. Try to be happy.

46:57.245 --> 46:59.805
But what if you can't make yourself happy?

46:59.881 --> 47:01.212
Well...

47:02.284 --> 47:04.582
...then I don't know.

47:04.653 --> 47:07.247
You know what you do then? You forget.

47:07.322 --> 47:08.846
Block it out.

47:09.891 --> 47:11.859
I remember...

47:12.894 --> 47:16.728
when my grandmother told me how to be happy.

47:16.798 --> 47:17.856
She said, "Leon..."

47:17.933 --> 47:20.094
Leon, my darling little grandson,

47:20.168 --> 47:21.795
if you want to be happy...

47:21.870 --> 47:23.394
don't think.

47:24.005 --> 47:26.974
Don't bump into any walls.

47:27.042 --> 47:28.907
If you stutter...

47:28.977 --> 47:30.842
"don't talk."

47:30.912 --> 47:33.039
I listened to my grandmother.

47:33.114 --> 47:35.048
Look at me now.

47:35.116 --> 47:37.584
Couldn't be happier.

47:37.652 --> 47:40.246
That's life.

47:41.089 --> 47:42.784
Darcy!

47:44.292 --> 47:45.384
Darcy!

47:46.695 --> 47:48.856
Darcy!

47:49.831 --> 47:51.924
Darcy!

47:52.534 --> 47:54.502
Darcy!

47:55.070 --> 47:57.061
Bennie, what's up?

47:57.138 --> 47:58.799
Nothing. What's up?

47:58.873 --> 48:01.239
Yo, is your sister home?

48:01.309 --> 48:03.573
- You want Darcy?
- Yeah.

48:03.678 --> 48:05.942
Hold on. Let me see if she's here.

48:07.215 --> 48:09.979
Yo, hurry the fuck up, man. I want to go swimming.

48:10.051 --> 48:12.178
Hold up, man. Damn.

48:14.255 --> 48:15.415
Hey.

48:15.490 --> 48:18.789
Hey, what's up? What are you doin' right now?

48:18.860 --> 48:21.294
I was just getting ready to take a bath.

48:21.363 --> 48:23.593
Don't take a bath. Come swim with us.

48:23.665 --> 48:25.656
Hi, Darcy!

48:25.734 --> 48:28.396
Hi, Kim. Hi, Joy.

48:28.470 --> 48:30.768
Come on. Come swimmin'.

48:30.839 --> 48:31.931
Right now?

48:32.007 --> 48:33.474
Yeah. Come on.

48:33.541 --> 48:35.008
Hold on.

48:37.545 --> 48:39.035
So that's your new girl, huh?

48:39.114 --> 48:40.376
I hope so. For now.

48:40.448 --> 48:41.915
You like 'em kinda young, right?

48:41.983 --> 48:43.245
Fuckin' babies.

48:43.318 --> 48:45.843
I like 'em new. Not like you.

48:45.920 --> 48:47.251
Fuck you.

48:47.322 --> 48:49.916
Damn, bitch, don't kill the shit.

48:49.991 --> 48:52.050
What the fuck?

48:52.127 --> 48:54.652
You think we might've killed that guy?

48:54.729 --> 48:55.855
No, man.

48:55.930 --> 48:56.862
You sure?

48:56.931 --> 48:58.091
I don't know, though.

48:58.166 --> 49:01.863
I kicked him so many times,
my fuckin' toes are broken.

49:03.805 --> 49:06.740
No, man. We didn't kill him,
'cause when we were through,

49:06.808 --> 49:08.605
he was all twitching.

49:08.676 --> 49:11.804
Word, he was crawling around the floor and shit.

49:11.880 --> 49:13.780
You guys are fuckin' sick, you know that?

49:13.848 --> 49:16.749
That's all right. That's how I'm living.

49:18.787 --> 49:20.448
It's unreal out here, right, Harold?

49:40.475 --> 49:41.772
Ready.

49:41.843 --> 49:43.708
You look nice.

50:30.825 --> 50:32.520
Hey, girl, what's up?

50:32.594 --> 50:34.994
Nothin'. Just some crazy shit.

50:35.063 --> 50:36.394
Have you seen Telly around?

50:36.464 --> 50:38.125
Yeah. Speaking of stupid shit...

50:38.199 --> 50:40.394
him and his ape-ass of a friend, Casper,

50:40.468 --> 50:41.992
they almost just killed some kid.

50:42.070 --> 50:44.595
- What happened?
- Some messy little scrap.

50:44.672 --> 50:47.539
- You know that bullshit.
- Yeah. You know where he went?

50:47.609 --> 50:50.635
I don't know. He said some shit about meeting Darcy.

50:50.712 --> 50:53.374
- I think he likes her now.
- Bennie's little sister?

50:53.448 --> 50:55.279
She should be at NASA tonight.

50:55.350 --> 50:57.875
Why are you looking for him? You like him now?

50:58.820 --> 51:01.914
Come on, man. Hurry up.

51:01.990 --> 51:04.254
Get in this piece.

51:04.359 --> 51:06.190
Hurry up, Kim.

51:08.496 --> 51:11.260
You think I ain't motherfuckin' hot naked?

51:11.332 --> 51:13.391
Shit.

51:13.468 --> 51:17.063
I'm jumpin' in before everybody. I don't give a fuck.

51:17.138 --> 51:20.198
Take your fucking clothes off
and shut the fuck up, Harold.

51:30.285 --> 51:34.381
Motherfucker, you know what I'm saying?

51:34.455 --> 51:37.481
Damn, Kim. Your body looks fucking dope.

51:39.227 --> 51:41.058
You think so?

51:41.129 --> 51:42.619
Hells, yeah. I'm serious, yo.

51:42.697 --> 51:45.723
It's funny, you don't know how dope a girl's body is

51:45.800 --> 51:47.768
until she takes all her clothes off.

51:48.803 --> 51:50.498
It looks good, right?

51:50.572 --> 51:52.836
Think it don't when it does?

51:52.907 --> 51:55.102
Aw, you don't look so bad yourself, Casper.

51:57.011 --> 52:00.174
That shit is rare. What about me?

52:00.248 --> 52:03.376
That's what I like about you. A girl's ass.

52:03.484 --> 52:06.578
Joy, ever seen a black man's lasso?

52:07.655 --> 52:10.180
Oh, my God!

52:15.630 --> 52:17.461
Look at it.

52:19.634 --> 52:22.159
Harold's dick is black and beautiful. Look at him.

52:23.071 --> 52:25.039
All right. Chill. Be quiet, be quiet.

52:31.613 --> 52:33.808
Look at that fuckin' shit.

52:33.881 --> 52:36.873
That's how I'm gonna be
up against your ass, like this.

52:42.757 --> 52:46.193
It's all gonna be against your ass.
I'm gonna be on the floor, like,

52:46.261 --> 52:47.785
down, break-break-breakin' that shit.

52:47.862 --> 52:51.525
- You know what I'm saying?
- We've seen enough, Harold.

52:51.599 --> 52:54.568
Break your back. Break, break, break.

52:54.636 --> 52:56.467
Hi-ho, Silver!

53:00.074 --> 53:03.635
Oh, shit! That shit is cold.

53:03.745 --> 53:05.508
I'm going to piss in the pool.

53:06.814 --> 53:08.805
I'm tellin' you, somebody's gonna piss in it.

53:08.883 --> 53:10.475
What's that?

53:10.551 --> 53:13.179
Damn, girl, that's my triple nipple.

53:18.359 --> 53:20.850
You're gonna give me goose bumps.

53:26.401 --> 53:28.869
I've been thinkin' about you a lot lately.

53:28.936 --> 53:30.369
- You have?
- Yeah.

53:30.438 --> 53:33.168
- After I seen you last week.
- At the block party.

53:33.241 --> 53:34.401
Yeah.

53:35.677 --> 53:37.975
I was looking for you all day today.

53:38.046 --> 53:39.843
You were?

53:39.914 --> 53:41.905
I thought about you when I woke up.

53:44.752 --> 53:48.654
"Where could Darcy be at?" I was looking all over.

53:48.723 --> 53:52.853
I'll give you a dollar if you let me suck your tit.

53:52.927 --> 53:56.328
No, though, I'm serious. Either of you guys.

53:56.397 --> 53:59.264
What really makes you think
I'll let you suck my tits?

53:59.334 --> 54:02.929
I don't know. They're just
sittin' there all ripe and firm.

54:03.037 --> 54:05.335
It makes you want to suck on them.

54:05.373 --> 54:07.034
Don't touch!

54:08.076 --> 54:09.703
Yeah, me too.

54:11.346 --> 54:13.314
Harold! Fuck you.

54:17.285 --> 54:19.378
I thought you had a girlfriend.

54:19.454 --> 54:21.445
No, I ain't seeing nobody.

54:21.522 --> 54:23.046
What about you?

54:23.124 --> 54:26.355
I can't. My mom won't let me have a boyfriend.

54:26.427 --> 54:28.657
She won't? Why not?

54:28.730 --> 54:30.197
I don't know.

54:30.264 --> 54:32.198
I guess it's 'cause my sister Nicki...

54:32.266 --> 54:34.700
had a baby when she was 15.

54:34.769 --> 54:38.569
She was real young so my mom's
very protective over me.

54:38.639 --> 54:40.903
I can understand that.

54:42.543 --> 54:45.774
They just look so fucking good.

54:45.847 --> 54:48.907
Yo, I truth or dare you guys to kiss each other.

54:48.983 --> 54:51.645
Sure. We do it all the time.

54:54.756 --> 54:57.384
- Holy shit.
- Holy s... damn!

54:58.259 --> 55:00.420
You guys are dykes, right?

55:00.495 --> 55:01.495
Shit!

55:03.431 --> 55:05.763
- No.
- How can you kiss each other?

55:05.833 --> 55:07.198
How can you do that?

55:07.268 --> 55:09.065
It don't matter. It just feels good.

55:09.137 --> 55:10.263
It's not like we're gay.

55:10.338 --> 55:12.704
It's just like kissing another person, a friend.

55:12.774 --> 55:14.969
- Oh, yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

55:15.042 --> 55:17.169
- Yeah, it's no big deal.
- Not at all.

55:17.245 --> 55:19.145
I don't know. I never seen...

55:19.213 --> 55:21.147
no shit like that in my life.

55:21.215 --> 55:23.012
I think it looks nice, though.

55:23.084 --> 55:25.985
- I know you think it's nice.
- Do it again.

55:26.053 --> 55:27.782
Fuck outta here, you guys.

55:27.855 --> 55:29.652
Come on. One more time.

55:29.724 --> 55:31.487
Shut the fuck up.

55:31.559 --> 55:34.892
You just did it. How the fuck
you ain't gonna do it again?

55:34.962 --> 55:37.089
- Do it again.
- Joy, do it again.

55:37.165 --> 55:39.599
- Stop sweatin' it, you guys.
- Suck her titty then.

55:39.667 --> 55:41.692
Why don't you suck each other's dicks?

55:41.769 --> 55:43.964
- I'm not gay.
- I'll fuck you up.

55:44.038 --> 55:45.801
Why don't you kiss me, then?

55:45.873 --> 55:48.603
I don't want to kiss you. You're not a girl.

55:48.676 --> 55:50.337
Yes, I am.

55:50.411 --> 55:52.538
- What's that?
- A clit.

55:52.613 --> 55:54.877
Harold will do anything for a kiss.

55:54.949 --> 55:56.814
I don't want to kiss you, Harold.

55:56.884 --> 55:59.284
- Come on, just one kiss.
- You're so fuckin' aggressive.

55:59.353 --> 56:00.684
I got to represent.

56:00.755 --> 56:02.279
"It just feels good, that's all."

56:02.390 --> 56:04.119
- Shut up.
- We're just friends.

56:04.158 --> 56:05.750
You made me horny right now.

56:05.827 --> 56:08.489
Come on. Why you gotta be like that?

56:08.563 --> 56:09.621
Just one kiss.

56:14.635 --> 56:16.364
Give her one kiss. Come on, man.

56:18.172 --> 56:20.003
Harold. Fuck you.

56:34.522 --> 56:37.855
I say we go skinny-dipping, man. Fuck this.

56:37.925 --> 56:40.120
- Let's just do it.
- Want to go skinny-dipping?

56:41.128 --> 56:44.154
You should come back to Steven's house tonight.

56:44.232 --> 56:45.756
Tonight?

56:45.833 --> 56:48.825
Come on. We'll bug out. His parents are away.

56:48.903 --> 56:51.736
I don't know. I'm supposed to go to NASA tonight.

56:51.806 --> 56:54.536
You can rave another night.
A bunch of people'll be there.

56:54.609 --> 56:56.270
- It'll be fun, I promise.
- Yeah?

56:57.512 --> 57:00.140
Come on, it'll be nice. It'll be a change of pace.

57:00.214 --> 57:02.682
That club shit gets boring.

57:12.995 --> 57:14.360
Jenny! What's up, girl?

57:14.429 --> 57:16.260
- How you doin'?
- Let's go.

57:24.072 --> 57:25.130
- Hey, Jenny.
- Hey.

58:05.981 --> 58:08.415
How you doin'? My name is Chi.

58:08.483 --> 58:09.643
Hi, Chi.

58:09.718 --> 58:10.980
All right, baby.

58:28.370 --> 58:30.099
Jenny-Jen! What's up?

58:31.273 --> 58:33.207
- How do you feel?
- What's goin' on?

58:33.275 --> 58:35.209
Oh, shit! I got to show you something.

58:35.277 --> 58:37.711
It's a spectacle. It's a real spectacle.

58:37.779 --> 58:39.246
Jesus Christ, look at this!

58:46.922 --> 58:48.412
What's up?

59:01.336 --> 59:03.497
Holy, they're still goin'!

59:03.572 --> 59:06.632
It's like amazing sexual exploration!

59:07.509 --> 59:10.808
You don't have to look at us. It's not a free show.

59:19.588 --> 59:20.588
Who are they?

59:20.656 --> 59:21.850
I don't know.

59:21.923 --> 59:24.756
I saw that one girl once before, but she's like...

59:24.826 --> 59:27.761
like I don't know, like her face
is all mangled and shit.

59:27.829 --> 59:30.354
But they look like cornballs from Jersey on Ecstasy,

59:30.432 --> 59:31.763
feelin' the effects-tasy.

59:49.885 --> 59:52.877
I got something for you. Check it out.

59:52.954 --> 59:54.888
It's a present. It's a pres.

59:54.956 --> 59:55.888
What is it?

59:55.957 --> 59:57.481
It's a pres, Jenny-Jen.

59:58.694 --> 1:00:00.252
It's like bang-up stuff.

1:00:01.930 --> 1:00:04.421
Yeah, it's called the euphoric blockbuster

1:00:04.499 --> 1:00:06.831
and it's supposed to make Special K look weak.

1:00:06.902 --> 1:00:07.994
- Take it.
- I don't...

1:00:08.070 --> 1:00:10.504
You look sad. Take it. Just swallow it.

1:02:49.765 --> 1:02:51.756
Nobody's real name is Casper.

1:02:51.834 --> 1:02:53.358
That's my real name, bitch.

1:02:53.436 --> 1:02:56.803

You like black bitches, white bitches, what?

1:03:13.289 --> 1:03:16.281
- Anything. It don't matter.

Well, bet whatever you want to bet, then.

1:03:28.204 --> 1:03:29.967
Don't worry about that.

How'd you hit it then. Doggy? What? Never, right?

1:03:33.209 --> 1:03:34.403
Probably a doggy.

1:03:34.477 --> 1:03:36.342
You ever get a blow job?

1:03:51.994 --> 1:03:54.155

1:05:07.770 --> 1:05:09.897
Oh, shit.

Why won't you give me the time of day, Gertie?

1:05:13.909 --> 1:05:14.841
Billy...

1:05:14.910 --> 1:05:18.402
I love you, Gertie. I feel like I love you.

1:05:18.481 --> 1:05:21.712
You just best get yourself out of my face, Billy.

1:05:21.784 --> 1:05:24.218
What do you mean, Gertie? I love you.

1:05:24.286 --> 1:05:26.254
I want to do somethin' for you.

1:05:26.322 --> 1:05:30.691
I want to take you out to dinner.
I want to take you out to eat.

1:05:30.760 --> 1:05:34.218
Billy, take your cracker ass out of my face.

1:05:34.296 --> 1:05:38.494
Gertie, I didn't mean it. Gertie.

1:05:38.567 --> 1:05:42.594
I want to buy you food, corn dogs, anything.

1:05:42.671 --> 1:05:44.935
Come on, baby. Just one more kiss.

1:05:45.007 --> 1:05:46.440
No, Harold, no.

1:05:46.509 --> 1:05:48.477
Come on, no.

1:06:35.191 --> 1:06:36.681
You know what I'm sayin'?

1:06:36.759 --> 1:06:39.489
I love you. I want to get close to you.

1:06:39.562 --> 1:06:44.363
I want to, I want to feel you. I want to be with you.

1:06:44.433 --> 1:06:47.231
It's real like that. You know what I'm sayin'?

1:06:47.303 --> 1:06:49.794
I want to... I want to sleep with you, Gertie.

1:06:51.907 --> 1:06:53.670
- Come on.
- No, no.

1:07:02.451 --> 1:07:04.817
Where did you get that shit?

1:07:04.887 --> 1:07:06.548
My brother.

1:07:48.197 --> 1:07:51.428
That is some good weed that your brother has.

1:07:51.500 --> 1:07:53.695
Where does he get it at?

1:07:53.769 --> 1:07:56.499
I don't know. He won't tell me.

1:07:56.572 --> 1:07:59.166
That sucks, your brother won't tell you about it.

1:07:59.241 --> 1:08:01.607
'Cause it's kinda whacked.

1:08:01.710 --> 1:08:05.009
If I knew where to get this,
I would get this every day.

1:08:12.855 --> 1:08:14.083
Yo, Ham...

1:08:15.724 --> 1:08:17.487
Pussy.

You takin' big hits for a little guy.

And you got, you got gold on your neck, too?

1:08:25.834 --> 1:08:27.358
That's crazy.

1:08:27.436 --> 1:08:29.734
That's nice. Christ on your neck.

1:08:29.805 --> 1:08:31.773
That's nice. I like that.

1:08:38.247 --> 1:08:41.580
- Jesus Christ.
- You believe in Him?

1:08:41.650 --> 1:08:44.016
Yeah, I believe in Him.

1:08:44.086 --> 1:08:46.281
That guy is the Saver, man.

1:08:46.355 --> 1:08:48.118
He's cool.

1:08:48.190 --> 1:08:49.487
Saved his life.

1:08:53.529 --> 1:08:55.224
- What's up, Jeff?
- 'S up?

1:08:55.965 --> 1:08:57.830
Chillin'.

1:08:57.900 --> 1:09:01.097
My man fucked up right here.

1:09:01.203 --> 1:09:02.795
Oh, shit.

1:09:10.346 --> 1:09:12.610
Oh, shit.

1:09:16.852 --> 1:09:21.687
That weed got you so fucked up
where you don't want to hit it?

1:09:21.757 --> 1:09:23.725
- That shit got me open.
- Yeah.

1:09:23.792 --> 1:09:26.158
- Like it?
- Yeah, dig it, y'all.

1:09:26.228 --> 1:09:28.492
It feels different, like you're in another world...

1:09:28.564 --> 1:09:31.431
like you zone out. You know what I'm sayin'?

1:09:31.500 --> 1:09:32.694
You're straight man.

1:09:32.768 --> 1:09:35.236
You straight?

1:09:35.304 --> 1:09:38.535
That's my limit. You know what I'm sayin'?

1:09:38.607 --> 1:09:40.040
The big hit man.

1:09:40.109 --> 1:09:42.270
You know what I'm sayin'? Big hit, baby.

1:09:42.344 --> 1:09:44.869
Get high quick. Big hits.

1:09:44.947 --> 1:09:46.812
I see the cherry go big, yo.

1:09:46.882 --> 1:09:48.008
Word?

1:09:48.083 --> 1:09:51.211
Steam that shit. Big hit man.

1:09:51.287 --> 1:09:53.255
Big hit.

1:09:53.322 --> 1:09:57.224
Well, see, a person like me

1:09:57.293 --> 1:09:58.885
I don't know why, either.

1:09:58.961 --> 1:10:01.088
Crazy, right?

1:10:01.163 --> 1:10:04.826
This party was dope, but that shit got played quick.

1:10:04.900 --> 1:10:06.993

I like you so much.

1:15:12.841 --> 1:15:15.810
I think you're beautiful.

1:15:15.877 --> 1:15:18.368
If we fucked, you would love it.

1:15:18.447 --> 1:15:20.915
You wouldn't believe it.

1:15:20.983 --> 1:15:22.780
How do you know?

1:15:25.754 --> 1:15:28.655
I just know. You'll love it.

1:15:30.025 --> 1:15:32.653
But I'm scared, Telly.

What's she lookin' worried about that nigga for, huh?

1:17:14.963 --> 1:17:18.660

That's it. You're doin' fine.

Come on, Darcy. That's it.

1:18:04.846 --> 1:18:07.007

1:20:32.662 --> 1:20:34.562
Lucky fuckin' bastard.

1:21:39.996 --> 1:21:41.861
Hey, Jenny, wake up.

1:21:45.368 --> 1:21:47.199
Hey, Jenny, wake up.

1:22:05.354 --> 1:22:07.083
Jenny, wake up.

1:23:42.184 --> 1:23:44.152
Don't worry, Jenny. It's me, Casper.

1:23:45.321 --> 1:23:47.152
Don't worry, Jenny.

1:23:58.434 --> 1:23:59.560
No.

1:23:59.668 --> 1:24:01.568
Shh. Shh.

1:24:11.981 --> 1:24:13.312
Shh.

1:24:22.691 --> 1:24:25.387
It's me, Casper. Don't worry.

1:25:41.837 --> 1:25:43.464
Shh...

1:25:45.741 --> 1:25:47.140
Don't.

1:27:55.871 --> 1:27:58.101
When you're young, not much matters.

1:27:58.173 --> 1:28:00.300
When you find something that you care about,

1:28:00.409 --> 1:28:02.240
then that's all you got.

1:28:02.277 --> 1:28:05.474
When you go to sleep at night, you dream of pussy.

1:28:05.547 --> 1:28:07.742
When you wake up, it's the same thing.

1:28:07.816 --> 1:28:11.013
It's there in your face. You can't escape it.

1:28:11.086 --> 1:28:12.610
Sometimes when you're young,

1:28:12.688 --> 1:28:14.622
the only place to go is inside.

1:28:14.690 --> 1:28:17.750
That's just it. Fuckin' is what I love.

1:28:17.826 --> 1:28:20.693
That that away from me and I really got nothin'.

1:28:28.170 --> 1:28:30.263
Jesus Christ, what happened?
