WEBVTT

00:00.052 --> 00:01.351
Previously on
<i>Suits...</i>

00:01.484 --> 00:02.925
It's going up
on the wall tomorrow...

00:03.011 --> 00:05.135
And this is your way
of getting me on your side.

00:05.160 --> 00:07.160
I don't want you
on my side.

00:08.143 --> 00:09.673
I want us to be
on the same side.

00:10.036 --> 00:11.868
I get
Ava Hessington acquitted.

00:11.941 --> 00:14.007
Darby backs me
for managing partner.

00:14.080 --> 00:15.911
I'm here to tell you
I don't want it anymore.

00:15.975 --> 00:17.541
Get out of my sight.

00:17.613 --> 00:19.306
Let me spell it out
for you, okay?

00:19.379 --> 00:21.778
You don't work my case
without me.

00:21.843 --> 00:23.182
And since you seem to be
having trouble

00:23.247 --> 00:25.488
understanding that,
you don't work my case at all.

00:25.553 --> 00:27.393
You and Stephen.

00:27.458 --> 00:28.521
It bothers me.

00:28.593 --> 00:29.824
I didn't know
you're a cat man.

00:29.896 --> 00:31.325
Do I have brains
in my head?

00:31.390 --> 00:32.549
Do I have a heart
in my chest?

00:32.588 --> 00:34.288
Who is this stunning creature?
Mikado.

00:34.353 --> 00:35.954
The Hong Kong office
urgently requires me

00:35.960 --> 00:37.223
for a few weeks.

00:37.288 --> 00:40.125
I'm sure there is a suitable
luxury feline hotel.

00:40.190 --> 00:42.324
- Don't play games, okay?
- So you'll do it?

00:42.397 --> 00:43.891
Nyes.
Can I have her?

00:43.962 --> 00:45.856
What do you want, Stephen?

00:45.928 --> 00:47.692
I heard Cameron
got a witness.

00:47.757 --> 00:49.857
He did?
What do you want?

00:49.922 --> 00:50.857
I'm just checking to see
if there's anything

00:50.922 --> 00:51.857
I can do to help.

00:51.922 --> 00:53.593
- There isn't.
- No way.

00:53.658 --> 00:55.161
If you didn't have
Mariga yesterday,

00:55.226 --> 00:56.433
you don't have him today.

00:56.498 --> 00:59.062
Why don't you ask your friend
Stephen Huntley?

00:59.127 --> 01:01.295
He's the one who led me
right to him.

01:09.746 --> 01:11.466
You know, you might just be
the perfect man.

01:11.511 --> 01:13.139
You're just coming
to realize that now?

01:13.204 --> 01:16.140
Mmhmm.

01:22.945 --> 01:24.214
Donna.

01:24.279 --> 01:26.718
I need a minute alone
with Stephen.

01:26.783 --> 01:29.121
Is it just a minute?
Or do I need to get a cab?

01:29.186 --> 01:33.123
It won't take long.
But the rest is up to you.

01:38.758 --> 01:41.039
Well, I'm guessing you're not
here to join us for dessert.

01:41.096 --> 01:44.768
You called Colonel Mariga.

01:44.833 --> 01:47.870
Yeah.
I called him.

01:47.934 --> 01:50.100
Called him to find out what
Cameron Dennis had offered him

01:50.172 --> 01:52.636
and to suggest
that he could do better.

01:52.709 --> 01:54.940
You mean you called him
to offer him a bribe.

01:55.013 --> 01:56.740
Doesn't matter.

01:56.813 --> 01:57.813
Dennis was bluffing.

01:57.878 --> 01:59.045
He never had him
in the first place.

01:59.118 --> 02:01.948
He didn't
but he does now

02:02.013 --> 02:04.348
because of you.

02:04.421 --> 02:06.388
You're saying
he traced my call?

02:06.453 --> 02:07.652
You're damn right I am.

02:07.725 --> 02:09.493
And you're angry with <i>me?</i>

02:09.558 --> 02:11.198
You're supposed to be
looking out for Ava.

02:11.262 --> 02:12.630
If I didn't know any better,
I'd think

02:12.695 --> 02:14.296
that you were working
for Cameron Dennis.

02:14.335 --> 02:17.102
And by the way,
the man is in hiding.

02:17.167 --> 02:19.333
His own country can't find him.
How the hell did you?

02:19.398 --> 02:20.669
Same way you would.

02:20.734 --> 02:22.740
You know people here.

02:22.805 --> 02:23.939
I know people everywhere.

02:24.004 --> 02:26.140
Well, calling those people
just screwed us.

02:26.205 --> 02:28.708
I called them, Harvey,
because you were doing nothing.

02:28.773 --> 02:31.548
I was doing nothing
because he had nothing.

02:31.613 --> 02:33.043
And then I had the tape
thrown out

02:33.116 --> 02:34.548
and he had less than nothing.

02:34.613 --> 02:37.020
Then he threw a hail Mary
and you just caught it.

02:37.085 --> 02:39.450
If he found Mariga
by tapping my phones,

02:39.523 --> 02:40.984
the judge
will throw him out.

02:41.049 --> 02:41.983
You think we're gonna be able
to prove

02:42.048 --> 02:43.086
that that's how
he found him?

02:43.151 --> 02:44.349
You wanna carry on
yelling at me?

02:44.422 --> 02:45.991
Or should we fix this?

02:46.056 --> 02:47.056
You know, I have had
about enough

02:47.121 --> 02:48.288
of your fixer crap, okay?

02:48.361 --> 02:50.792
You didn't fix shit.
You broke it wide open.

02:50.865 --> 02:52.389
Then what the hell
are you doing here?

02:52.462 --> 02:54.322
I'm here to tell you
that if I hear your name

02:54.395 --> 02:55.361
around my case again,

02:55.426 --> 03:00.196
I am gonna beat the shit
outta you.

03:04.471 --> 03:06.436
You told him you were gonna
beat the shit out of him?

03:06.509 --> 03:08.075
Yeah, and that's
the last time

03:08.140 --> 03:09.444
I'm gonna tell him anything.

03:09.509 --> 03:11.275
What?

03:11.347 --> 03:12.714
You think I wouldn't
do it?

03:12.779 --> 03:14.409
No, I'm not sure
you <i>could</i> do it.

03:14.482 --> 03:15.945
What's he going
to hit me with, his ascot?

03:16.010 --> 03:18.450
Harvey, the man plays rugby.
That's no joke.

03:18.515 --> 03:19.819
How do you even
know that?

03:19.884 --> 03:21.587
It's on the Darby
international website.

03:21.652 --> 03:23.353
I don't give you
enough work.

03:23.418 --> 03:24.920
And I'm gonna change that
right now.

03:24.985 --> 03:27.854
Cameron's not denying us access
to Mariga,

03:27.919 --> 03:30.189
which means he's gonna sing
any song Cameron wants

03:30.254 --> 03:31.294
to avoid a firing squad--

03:31.359 --> 03:32.696
So I need to find anything
I can

03:32.761 --> 03:34.463
to take Mariga apart.

03:34.528 --> 03:35.599
What the hell is this?

03:35.664 --> 03:36.800
I'll tell you what it is.

03:36.865 --> 03:39.031
It's a witness list
from Cameron Dennis

03:39.104 --> 03:40.366
with Colonel Mariga on it.

03:40.439 --> 03:41.733
And he's giving us access,

03:41.806 --> 03:43.269
which means he's not bluffing.

03:43.334 --> 03:44.373
I know.

03:44.438 --> 03:45.470
You told me
he didn't have him.

03:45.543 --> 03:46.543
He didn't.

03:46.608 --> 03:47.808
Then how the hell
did he get him?

03:47.881 --> 03:50.481
Stephen.
He was trying to fix it.

03:50.546 --> 03:52.713
Are you telling me
you let Stephen Huntley

03:52.786 --> 03:54.889
lead Cameron directly
to the star witness?

03:54.953 --> 03:56.184
I didn't let Stephen
do shit.

03:56.257 --> 03:58.552
He did it on his own.
He's your guy.

03:58.625 --> 04:00.088
You aligned with him.
I did not.

04:00.161 --> 04:01.655
Okay, he's Edward Darby's guy.

04:01.728 --> 04:03.094
You made a deal
with Darby.

04:03.159 --> 04:07.957
That makes him your guy.

04:08.030 --> 04:09.596
You really wanna do this
right now?

04:09.661 --> 04:13.463
Are you telling me
he doesn't know?

04:13.528 --> 04:16.002
You know I know.

04:16.067 --> 04:18.404
You and I had
this conversation once.

04:18.469 --> 04:21.232
And you know
where my loyalties lie.

04:21.305 --> 04:24.037
And as for your point,
Stephen is only here at all

04:24.102 --> 04:26.706
because you made a deal
with Darby in the first place.

04:26.771 --> 04:31.248
And I told you,
I don't want mine anymore.

04:31.313 --> 04:32.816
Then I guess
I'm still in charge.

04:32.881 --> 04:35.416
And since I've now been drafted
onto this case,

04:35.481 --> 04:38.320
no one tells Edward Darby

04:38.385 --> 04:40.489
or Stephen Huntley
a goddamn thing.

04:40.554 --> 04:45.103

What'd you get me?

05:32.209 --> 05:33.649
This isn't the first time
Mariga lied

05:33.718 --> 05:34.389
to get out of prosecution.

05:34.454 --> 05:35.484
Other murders?

05:35.557 --> 05:38.292
Murder. Extortion.
Embezzlement.

05:38.357 --> 05:39.587
You want someone
to commit a crime

05:39.660 --> 05:41.387
and blame it on someone else,
he's your guy.

05:41.460 --> 05:43.091
You got the questions
lined up?

05:43.156 --> 05:44.563
Right here.

05:44.628 --> 05:49.163
But I think you know
what my biggest question is.

05:49.236 --> 05:50.403
What do you want me
to say?

05:50.468 --> 05:52.638
I changed my mind about Darby.
I told Jessica.

05:52.704 --> 05:53.974
And I didn't get a chance
to tell you

05:54.039 --> 05:55.406
because we had bigger fish
to fry.

05:55.479 --> 05:57.310
I understand why you didn't
get a chance to tell me.

05:57.375 --> 05:58.974
What I don't get is
why you told her.

05:59.047 --> 06:01.781
If I can't trust her
to get over it after I tell her,

06:01.846 --> 06:04.516
I might as well have stuck
with Darby in the first place.

06:04.580 --> 06:06.148
Doesn't look like
she's over it.

06:06.221 --> 06:07.917
Because she knows
what we know.

06:07.990 --> 06:11.852
Right now,
we got bigger fish to fry.

06:23.733 --> 06:27.971
Are you kidding me?

06:28.036 --> 06:29.172
Norma?

06:29.237 --> 06:30.846
I've told you a million
goddamn times.

06:30.911 --> 06:32.383
2% of Mikado's afternoon milk.

06:32.448 --> 06:33.728
She's gonna taste
the extra skim.

06:33.785 --> 06:35.520
And who do you think
she's gonna take it out on?

06:35.585 --> 06:37.449
Me.

06:37.522 --> 06:38.586
Oh, and find out
what the holdup is

06:38.659 --> 06:40.156
on my trademark claim
on "Litt Up."

06:40.228 --> 06:42.094
Nigel, you're back a week early.

06:42.167 --> 06:43.663
I was gonna holiday
an extra week.

06:43.736 --> 06:45.800
But I was rejuvenated
after only two days

06:45.873 --> 06:48.737
in the native clays
at Guangzhou.

06:48.810 --> 06:50.042
You're glowing.

06:50.107 --> 06:53.013
And I can't wait
to see Mikado.

06:53.078 --> 06:54.752
The lovely lass is here,
I see.

06:54.818 --> 06:57.121
Uh, no, she's not here.

06:57.186 --> 07:01.057
Then who's that for?

07:01.130 --> 07:03.361
That's for me.

07:03.426 --> 07:06.035
It's my afternoon milk.

07:13.973 --> 07:16.784
Hits the spot.
Gotta run.

07:16.849 --> 07:18.480
Louis.

07:18.553 --> 07:20.583
Where is she?

07:20.656 --> 07:22.254
At the best cat spa
in the city,

07:22.319 --> 07:24.054
getting her nails buffed
and her paws polished.

07:24.119 --> 07:25.687
You spoil her.

07:25.760 --> 07:27.895
- She spoils me.
- Call me when she's back.

07:27.960 --> 07:29.896
I will.

07:34.735 --> 07:37.670
Rachel, Louis.
Code Red.

08:02.501 --> 08:03.637
Did anybody see you
leave my office?

08:03.702 --> 08:04.765
- Norma gave me a look.
- She's on our side.

08:04.838 --> 08:06.069
Rachel, concentrate.

08:06.134 --> 08:07.341
I don't even know
if I'm on your side.

08:07.406 --> 08:09.574
This isn't right.
She wants to be my cat.

08:09.639 --> 08:10.806
No.
You want her to be your cat.

08:10.879 --> 08:12.310
You don't understand.

08:12.375 --> 08:13.984
This past week has been the best
week of my life, ever since--

08:14.049 --> 08:15.153
Bruno, I understand.

08:15.218 --> 08:16.987
But you can't keep Mikado.

08:17.052 --> 08:18.292
She's Nigel's cat.

08:18.357 --> 08:21.725
- Well said.
- Ah, Nigel, how did you--

08:21.798 --> 08:23.230
By doing what any
self-respecting cat owner

08:23.295 --> 08:26.336
would do:
Equipping her with an RFID.

08:26.401 --> 08:28.809
A radio-frequency-identifier
integrated circuit.

08:28.874 --> 08:31.137
Why would you hide
my prize possession?

08:31.210 --> 08:33.873
Is that what she is to you?
A possession?

08:33.946 --> 08:37.881
What she is to me
is between me and her.

08:40.020 --> 08:43.054
You're right.

08:43.128 --> 08:46.599
He's right.

08:46.664 --> 08:50.169
I'm sorry.

08:53.140 --> 08:54.308
I'm not ready.
Louis.

08:54.373 --> 08:55.783
He was supposed to be gone
for two weeks.

08:55.848 --> 08:58.208
We had a verbal contract I would
have custody for two weeks.

08:58.216 --> 08:59.951
It was
a baby-sitting arrangement.

09:00.016 --> 09:01.055
One that I was
mentally, emotionally,

09:01.120 --> 09:02.241
and physically prepared for.

09:02.256 --> 09:03.736
And accordingly,
I am legally entitled

09:03.755 --> 09:05.194
to Mikado
for one more week.

09:05.259 --> 09:07.625
That is not the law.

09:07.698 --> 09:09.726
There's actually precedent.

09:09.791 --> 09:13.599
Warminsky v. Mitchell, 1974.

09:15.034 --> 09:16.601
I have a meeting,

09:16.673 --> 09:20.605
after which I will collect
what is rightfully mine.

09:27.053 --> 09:28.547
- That was genius.
- No, Louis.

09:28.619 --> 09:30.385
That was a stall

09:30.450 --> 09:32.216
because the truth is
Nigel's right.

09:32.289 --> 09:35.260
She's not your cat.

09:35.325 --> 09:37.765
You've gotta let her go.

09:39.663 --> 09:40.862
Hey, do you wanna talk
about last night?

09:40.935 --> 09:42.302
No, Donna, I don't.

09:42.367 --> 09:44.533
Harvey, you said my being
with Stephen bothered you.

09:44.606 --> 09:45.886
And I just wanna
make sure that--

09:45.933 --> 09:48.973
That what he did deserved
interrupting your date?

09:49.038 --> 09:49.973
- Did it?
- I don't know, Donna.

09:50.038 --> 09:51.141
You tell me.

09:51.206 --> 09:52.971
I mean, we had this entire case
locked up.

09:53.044 --> 09:54.677
I mean, your boyfriend
gave Cameron

09:54.750 --> 09:56.413
a Get-Out-Of-Jail-Free card

09:56.478 --> 09:58.246
after I told him to stay
the hell out of it.

09:58.319 --> 09:59.254
What'd he do?

09:59.320 --> 10:00.720
He tracked down Mariga

10:00.785 --> 10:02.025
and led Cameron
right to him.

10:02.090 --> 10:03.362
- Harvey, I'm--
- You know what?

10:03.427 --> 10:05.425
Instead of discussing Stephen
shit-ing the bed,

10:05.498 --> 10:08.528
right now,
I have to try to clean it up.

10:14.639 --> 10:16.647
Gwambaa.

10:16.712 --> 10:18.709
Makaiwa.

10:18.774 --> 10:20.244
Port Eefa.

10:20.309 --> 10:21.612
40 people killed.

10:21.676 --> 10:24.515
Are you here to answer
questions or ask them?

10:24.580 --> 10:25.947
Are you familiar
with these photos?

10:26.020 --> 10:27.619
I'm responsible
for these photos.

10:27.683 --> 10:28.880
You seem proud of yourself.

10:28.953 --> 10:31.486
I am a military man
in a violent country.

10:31.551 --> 10:33.718
I do what needs to be done.

10:33.783 --> 10:35.192
That doesn't make me
a murderer.

10:35.257 --> 10:36.690
Because you kill people

10:36.763 --> 10:37.961
under orders
from your government.

10:38.026 --> 10:39.024
Precisely.

10:39.097 --> 10:40.063
Isn't that exactly
what you did

10:40.128 --> 10:41.493
on Hessington Oil's land?

10:41.558 --> 10:43.293
No, I killed those people

10:43.358 --> 10:45.334
because I was paid
by your client.

10:45.399 --> 10:46.863
Well, that <i>does</i> make you
a murderer.

10:46.936 --> 10:48.870
And you're only saying
that Ava knew about it

10:48.936 --> 10:50.534
because your precious government

10:50.607 --> 10:52.730
is no longer in power
to protect you.

10:52.802 --> 10:53.968
That is not true.

10:54.033 --> 10:55.432
And what exactly is
the penalty

10:55.505 --> 10:57.568
if you're found guilty of murder
in your country?

10:57.642 --> 10:58.937
Death.

10:59.010 --> 11:01.209
And why is it you haven't
been sent back there?

11:01.274 --> 11:03.480
I'll take this one.
He cut a deal with me.

11:03.545 --> 11:05.711
Because I care more about
the person who ordered this

11:05.776 --> 11:07.048
than the person
who carried it out.

11:07.113 --> 11:08.113
There's only one problem.

11:08.114 --> 11:09.955
He only met with Ava once.

11:10.020 --> 11:12.691
And your only proof
of that meeting is inadmissible.

11:12.756 --> 11:13.986
Wrong.

11:14.059 --> 11:17.160
He didn't only talk
to Ava once.

11:17.225 --> 11:19.296
I told your client
about what needed to be done

11:19.361 --> 11:22.696
when we spoke
on the phone.

11:22.762 --> 11:24.497
Ah.

11:25.803 --> 11:28.067
Ms. Hessington didn't tell you
about that.

11:28.140 --> 11:30.206
She didn't tell us about that
because that never happened.

11:30.279 --> 11:31.360
What'd you expect her
to do?

11:31.415 --> 11:33.615
Come to you
and say "I did it?"

11:33.682 --> 11:38.015
A record of the call
from Ava's private, secure line.

11:38.088 --> 11:40.148
A call in which we discussed
the impediments

11:40.221 --> 11:41.251
to the pipeline,

11:41.316 --> 11:43.483
the six leaders
who stood in its way,

11:43.556 --> 11:46.127
and the cost
for their removal.

11:46.192 --> 11:49.328
$3 million,
which she admitted paying

11:49.401 --> 11:51.570
in the admission
you had her sign.

11:51.635 --> 11:55.638
I don't need the tape because
I have everything I need,

11:55.703 --> 11:58.638
including the fact that she lied
about that phone call.

12:09.188 --> 12:10.988
Hey.

12:11.053 --> 12:12.090
What happened to you
last night?

12:12.155 --> 12:13.720
I think you know
what happened.

12:13.793 --> 12:14.991
I saw you two yelling
at each other

12:15.057 --> 12:16.687
and I didn't want any part
of it.

12:16.760 --> 12:19.329
Well, believe me, I didn't
want any part of it either.

12:19.394 --> 12:20.667
Well, what did you think
he was gonna do

12:20.732 --> 12:23.467
when he found out
you screwed up his case?

12:23.532 --> 12:25.136
I think you know that I wasn't
trying to screw it up.

12:25.201 --> 12:26.367
But you did.

12:26.432 --> 12:28.566
And he specifically told you
to stay away.

12:28.638 --> 12:30.933
And you told me not
to discuss you with him.

12:31.006 --> 12:33.102
So why are you discussing him
with me?

12:33.175 --> 12:35.278
Because I have a relationship
with him

12:35.343 --> 12:36.943
that's a lot longer
than a few weeks.

12:37.008 --> 12:38.982
And when you mess with him,
you mess with me.

12:39.047 --> 12:40.350
Donna, I wasn't trying
to mess with him.

12:40.415 --> 12:41.516
I was trying to help him.

12:41.581 --> 12:43.180
And as long as we're on
the subject,

12:43.245 --> 12:46.254
I'm sure he mentioned if
it wasn't for my previous help,

12:46.319 --> 12:49.117
he wouldn't still have Ava
as a client.

12:49.190 --> 12:52.688
You know, he might've
mentioned something about that.

12:52.753 --> 12:56.917
Then can we get back
to not discussing him?

12:56.990 --> 12:58.493
As long as you promise
not to do anything

12:58.558 --> 13:02.524
to make us not discuss him
ever again.

13:02.597 --> 13:06.166
I promise.

13:06.231 --> 13:09.367
Good boy.

13:09.440 --> 13:10.966
I'm gonna ask you once.

13:11.039 --> 13:13.406
Is he telling
the truth?

13:13.471 --> 13:14.838
Yes.

13:14.911 --> 13:16.374
We had a conversation
on the phone

13:16.439 --> 13:18.845
but not about murder.

13:18.910 --> 13:22.346
You didn't think we needed
to know?

13:22.411 --> 13:23.880
I didn't remember.

13:23.945 --> 13:25.911
That lie won't play well
in court.

13:25.976 --> 13:27.215
I told you about
the meeting.

13:27.280 --> 13:29.110
I didn't think to tell you
about the call

13:29.183 --> 13:30.246
where we agreed to meet.

13:30.319 --> 13:31.747
That's all it was.

13:31.812 --> 13:33.450
When? Where?
How much money?

13:33.515 --> 13:35.620
Not even that.
That was settled beforehand.

13:35.681 --> 13:36.880
It was a formality
Nick arranged.

13:36.953 --> 13:38.879
Nick Howell?
Your former protege?

13:38.952 --> 13:41.519
He dealt with these people.
He knew what's expected.

13:41.584 --> 13:44.885
It was a social nicety
so insignificant,

13:44.958 --> 13:46.484
I didn't remember
until you brought it up.

13:46.557 --> 13:47.758
They brought it up.

13:47.823 --> 13:50.031
And now, they're gonna point out
that you didn't.

13:50.096 --> 13:52.597
I understand
it looks bad.

13:52.661 --> 13:54.531
But Edward said that this man
is a murderer.

13:54.596 --> 13:55.659
And there's no need for me
to be concerned--

13:55.732 --> 13:57.498
Edward Darby says
a lot of things

13:57.563 --> 13:59.360
you want to believe
but shouldn't.

13:59.433 --> 14:01.263
You don't believe me.

14:01.328 --> 14:02.430
Hiding a conversation

14:02.495 --> 14:03.895
and then coming clean
about it later

14:03.938 --> 14:05.506
tends to get in the way
of trust.

14:05.571 --> 14:07.509
- Jessica--
- It makes you disingenuous.

14:07.574 --> 14:10.908
It makes you look guilty.

14:10.981 --> 14:12.314
I'm not.

14:12.379 --> 14:14.807
Do you find that people
usually kill your enemies

14:14.880 --> 14:16.143
for you without your asking?

14:16.216 --> 14:19.080
- Jessica.
- Ava, you'll have to excuse us.

14:19.153 --> 14:20.321
We have to come up
with another plan

14:20.386 --> 14:24.398
because the one we had
just went to shit.

14:37.518 --> 14:39.923
I can't help but notice
you've come empty-handed.

14:39.988 --> 14:44.225
Not exactly.

14:50.960 --> 14:54.231
You're suing me for ownership
of Mikado.

14:54.296 --> 14:55.464
On what grounds?

14:55.529 --> 14:57.065
On the grounds that I provide
a better home

14:57.137 --> 14:58.903
because you're constantly flying
around the world.

14:58.968 --> 15:00.798
Mary Poppins doesn't
get custody

15:00.871 --> 15:02.270
of the children
in her care.

15:02.335 --> 15:03.871
The Von Trapp children
fell in love with Maria.

15:03.944 --> 15:07.111
She became their mother.
Because their mother was dead.

15:07.176 --> 15:08.743
There's no legal basis
for this.

15:08.816 --> 15:10.848
You're confident
in that fact?

15:10.913 --> 15:11.913
Most assuredly.

15:11.986 --> 15:15.585
Then let's put it
to our own jury.

15:15.658 --> 15:17.456
You're suggesting
a mock trial.

15:17.521 --> 15:18.593
You get to prove you're
the better man

15:18.658 --> 15:20.626
in front
of our associates.

15:20.691 --> 15:23.026
You agree to hand her back
the moment the verdict is in?

15:23.099 --> 15:24.163
I agree to let you say
good-bye to her

15:24.228 --> 15:25.267
the moment
that you're defeated.

15:32.236 --> 15:34.307
Whatever the hell
that means.

15:34.372 --> 15:36.447
Glad to see you haven't lost
your touch with the clients.

15:36.511 --> 15:37.711
I don't have to be
nice to her.

15:37.752 --> 15:39.550
I just have to clean up
after her bullshit.

15:39.615 --> 15:41.613
She didn't lie.
She just made a mistake.

15:41.686 --> 15:43.418
We still have
to clean it up.

15:43.483 --> 15:45.080
And she just handed us
a road map.

15:45.153 --> 15:46.717
You wanna go after
Nick Howell.

15:46.782 --> 15:48.485
He's reasonable doubt
staring us right in the face.

15:48.550 --> 15:50.254
It's a bad idea.

15:50.319 --> 15:52.254
He admitted to the bribe,
he set up the call,

15:52.319 --> 15:54.158
and he was her man
on the ground.

15:54.223 --> 15:55.623
Laying it on Nick
would be admitting

15:55.626 --> 15:58.161
Hessington Oil paid Mariga
to kill those people.

15:58.234 --> 16:00.266
We already admitted
that Ava paid him.

16:00.331 --> 16:02.136
And Mariga already admitted
to the murders.

16:02.201 --> 16:04.062
This is exactly why
we should stick to the plan

16:04.135 --> 16:05.965
to destroy Mariga's testimony.

16:06.038 --> 16:07.037
Not wanting to be shot

16:07.102 --> 16:08.733
is a hell of an incentive
to lie.

16:08.806 --> 16:10.500
And an easy thing for a jury
to understand.

16:10.573 --> 16:13.106
Let me spell this out
for you.

16:13.171 --> 16:15.874
You don't just show
that your client didn't do it

16:15.939 --> 16:17.745
when you can point to someone
who did.

16:17.810 --> 16:19.407
But you're never gonna
convince a jury

16:19.472 --> 16:23.144
the number one didn't know
what the number two was up to.

16:23.217 --> 16:24.816
You have the balls
to say that to me?

16:24.881 --> 16:25.984
I'm not saying--

16:26.049 --> 16:28.286
I don't care
what you're saying.

16:28.351 --> 16:30.150
I'm the one in charge
of this case.

16:30.215 --> 16:32.623
And believe me,
I can convince anyone

16:32.688 --> 16:34.360
of the fact
that a number two

16:34.424 --> 16:38.927
can betray a number one
behind her back.

16:38.992 --> 16:42.126
Out.

16:56.849 --> 16:58.329
- You still hiding from Nigel?
- What?

16:58.385 --> 16:59.312
No, I'm looking
for Katrina.

16:59.385 --> 17:03.016
She just left
for Barcelona.

17:04.721 --> 17:05.824
Sorry? She what?

17:05.888 --> 17:08.558
The training program.

17:08.623 --> 17:10.861
- Nesbitt.
- Why would he send her away?

17:10.925 --> 17:12.125
Because he knew I'd pick her
to represent me

17:12.190 --> 17:13.556
at Mikado's custody hearing.

17:13.628 --> 17:16.290
You're suing for custody?
Louis, that's insane.

17:16.364 --> 17:18.425
- Rachel, he abandoned her.
- He went on a business trip.

17:18.499 --> 17:19.897
- Okay, whose side are you on?
- Yours.

17:19.963 --> 17:21.434
But the law is not
with you.

17:21.499 --> 17:22.434
What, you think
when you become a lawyer,

17:22.499 --> 17:23.579
you're gonna be
trying cases

17:23.603 --> 17:24.464
where the law
is always on your side?

17:24.538 --> 17:25.536
- Louis.
- Rachel.

17:25.601 --> 17:26.767
You need to tell me
which associate

17:26.832 --> 17:30.238
is least loyal
to Nigel now.

17:30.303 --> 17:31.440
- Kaufman.
- No, too green.

17:31.505 --> 17:32.608
Corcoran.

17:32.673 --> 17:33.912
The guy owned a hamster
as a child.

17:33.977 --> 17:36.879
He'll view a cat
as a predator.

17:36.945 --> 17:38.943
- Donahue?
- D-D-D-D-D-Donahue?

17:39.016 --> 17:40.936
I'll not only lose custody,
I may end up in jail.

17:40.952 --> 17:43.086
- For what?
- Rachel, I stole the man's cat.

17:43.151 --> 17:45.182
And I need someone
who understands why.

17:45.254 --> 17:47.883
Then who, Louis?

17:52.922 --> 17:54.423
You.

17:54.489 --> 17:56.925
- I'm not a lawyer, Louis.
- You're gonna be soon enough.

17:56.990 --> 17:58.689
You run circles around
those clowns.

17:58.754 --> 18:02.254
And Nigel holds no sway
over you.

18:02.319 --> 18:04.728
Okay.

18:04.793 --> 18:07.730
You are asking me to help you
steal Nigel's cat.

18:10.068 --> 18:13.543
Rachel, you know how tough
it's been for me this year.

18:13.608 --> 18:16.007
I lost the associates.

18:16.080 --> 18:19.047
Mike made a fool of me.

18:19.113 --> 18:20.713
I saw Harvey's name go up
on the wall.

18:20.786 --> 18:23.518
And I went home.

18:23.583 --> 18:26.990
But you know
what happened?

18:27.055 --> 18:28.486
Mikado saw my pain.

18:28.559 --> 18:31.694
And she brought me
a mouse.

18:37.292 --> 18:39.458
Louis, we have a murder trial
going on.

18:39.531 --> 18:42.466
A trial that I have nothing
to do with.

18:46.036 --> 18:49.741
Rachel, I love her.

18:49.806 --> 18:52.014
Now, I once fought valiantly
for your dream.

18:52.079 --> 18:56.083
And even though I lost...

18:58.149 --> 19:02.457
I'm asking you.

19:02.523 --> 19:05.465
Fight for mine?

19:10.664 --> 19:12.198
Jessica!

19:12.263 --> 19:13.598
You have something for me
on Nick Howell?

19:13.671 --> 19:15.070
Nick Howell
didn't do this.

19:15.135 --> 19:16.334
Yeah, what the hell does
that have to do with anything?

19:16.407 --> 19:18.006
Look, Harvey's problem
with going after Nick

19:18.071 --> 19:19.910
is that it might backfire
on Ava, right?

19:19.975 --> 19:21.342
But even if it doesn't,
we're still putting

19:21.407 --> 19:22.768
an innocent man
in the cross hairs.

19:22.807 --> 19:24.645
An innocent man.

19:24.710 --> 19:26.479
He sold out Ava the second
he had a chance.

19:26.552 --> 19:28.151
And I sat there
and watched him do it.

19:28.217 --> 19:29.697
Cameron had him backed
against a wall.

19:29.753 --> 19:30.913
He just did what he had
to do.

19:30.921 --> 19:32.352
And now, we're backed up
against a wall.

19:32.424 --> 19:35.355
And I don't give a shit
about Ava's number two.

19:35.419 --> 19:38.155
He can rot in hell
for all I care.

19:38.220 --> 19:42.094
I just have
one question.

19:42.167 --> 19:46.230
Are you going after him
because he tried to sell Ava out

19:46.303 --> 19:50.173
or because Harvey
tried to sell you out?

19:50.238 --> 19:51.471
What did you just say
to me?

19:51.544 --> 19:53.407
I just wanna make sure
we're not potentially

19:53.472 --> 19:54.607
throwing a man's
life away

19:54.680 --> 19:58.217
just because you're mad
at someone else.

19:58.282 --> 19:59.913
Instead of you coming
down here

19:59.986 --> 20:02.249
and telling me
who to be mad at,

20:02.322 --> 20:03.890
why don't you do
your job?

20:03.955 --> 20:06.557
And find out what the hell
Cameron has on Nick Howell

20:06.630 --> 20:09.904
that had him turn on Ava
in the first place

20:09.969 --> 20:12.400
because if you think all it was
was that tape,

20:12.474 --> 20:16.410
then you don't know
what the hell you're doing.

20:26.432 --> 20:29.463
They wanna talk settlement
and they sent you?

20:29.536 --> 20:31.334
No, they didn't.

20:31.399 --> 20:33.438
So you're going rogue?
Bullshit.

20:33.503 --> 20:35.733
I don't buy it--
You can buy whatever you want.

20:35.805 --> 20:37.500
The fact is you, Harvey,
and Jessica

20:37.573 --> 20:38.941
are so busy trying
to beat each other,

20:39.006 --> 20:41.078
you can't see you all have
your heads up your asses.

20:41.143 --> 20:43.141
Cocky, I get it.
Harvey taught you well.

20:43.214 --> 20:47.076
No, what Harvey taught me
is to help my client.

20:47.149 --> 20:48.549
Now, look.

20:48.614 --> 20:50.423
I can't guarantee you
that we'll agree to anything.

20:50.488 --> 20:52.856
But Ava deserves
an offer.

20:52.922 --> 20:54.794
I spelled out my offer
a week ago.

20:54.859 --> 20:56.330
Yeah, an offer based on
a bluff.

20:56.395 --> 20:57.594
Huh, now,
I've got the real deal.

20:57.667 --> 20:59.898
It was 9.
Now, it's 12.

20:59.963 --> 21:02.137
Your real deal is
a confessed murderer

21:02.203 --> 21:03.571
and a vindictive ex-employee.

21:03.636 --> 21:06.108
I've got one saying
that Ava paid for it.

21:06.173 --> 21:09.340
And another saying she knew
what she was paying for.

21:09.413 --> 21:11.348
Great, then get me
a goddamn offer under nine,

21:11.413 --> 21:12.381
and I'll get you
a deal.

21:12.446 --> 21:14.783
This negotiation
is over, Junior.

21:14.856 --> 21:16.319
Take your ball
and go home.

21:16.384 --> 21:18.288
You really are a dick.

21:18.361 --> 21:20.624
- What did you say?
- I said you're a dick.

21:20.697 --> 21:24.126
And you can take your offer
and shove it up your ass.

21:29.195 --> 21:31.835
I am so sorry.
You little piss ant.

21:31.900 --> 21:33.835
I can't believe
this shit.

21:33.900 --> 21:35.602
Who the hell do you think
you're dealing with?

21:35.667 --> 21:37.001
You know, I could have
you locked up

21:37.066 --> 21:38.200
for assault right now?

21:38.272 --> 21:39.238
Yeah, I'm sorry.

21:39.303 --> 21:41.700
You know, I just--
I lost my head.

21:41.773 --> 21:43.639
Please.

21:43.704 --> 21:45.175
I-I was just trying
to do my job.

21:45.240 --> 21:49.016
Take your mediation and get
the hell out of my office.

21:49.081 --> 21:52.882
Yes, sir.

21:55.858 --> 21:57.381
Mr. Litt,
how would you describe

21:57.454 --> 22:00.924
Mikado's well-being
when she came under your care?

22:00.989 --> 22:04.628
Well, Mikado's physical needs
were taken care of.

22:04.693 --> 22:06.429
But there's more to a cat
than its physical condition.

22:06.494 --> 22:07.693
They're highly
emotional creatures.

22:07.766 --> 22:09.565
And were her emotional needs
tended to?

22:09.630 --> 22:11.966
Calls for speculation.
He's not the cat whisperer.

22:12.039 --> 22:14.735
He can't testify
to Mikado's thoughts,

22:14.808 --> 22:16.905
which you should've
objected to.

22:16.978 --> 22:19.011
- Sorry, sir.
- Very well.

22:19.084 --> 22:21.948
Mr. Litt,
without speaking for Mikado,

22:22.021 --> 22:24.019
would you describe
for the court

22:24.084 --> 22:25.721
her emotional condition?

22:25.786 --> 22:28.018
When Mikado first entered
my home,

22:28.091 --> 22:30.925
she was aloof
and standoffish.

22:30.998 --> 22:32.494
She's a cat.

22:32.567 --> 22:34.296
Sorry.
I'll wait my turn.

22:34.368 --> 22:35.598
She was listless,
you know?

22:35.671 --> 22:38.132
Like, I would take her out
to see a bird

22:38.197 --> 22:40.636
or a dog.

22:40.701 --> 22:43.680
And there'd just
be nothing.

22:43.745 --> 22:44.946
You know what I think?
Hm?

22:45.011 --> 22:47.181
I think that she was
the victim of neglect

22:47.255 --> 22:48.820
due to the absence
of a consistent father figure

22:48.885 --> 22:49.956
because he's traveling
all the time.

22:50.021 --> 22:51.492
- I object.
- To what?

22:51.557 --> 22:53.956
To you letting him talk
about my cat that way.

22:54.021 --> 22:55.861
You changed the rules
to get Ms. Zane.

22:55.926 --> 22:58.969
I'm changing the rules.
I'm gonna represent myself.

22:59.034 --> 23:00.074
- But--
- You're dismissed.

23:05.476 --> 23:06.908
Getting hot in here, Nesbitt?

23:06.981 --> 23:08.477
Mr. Litt, I'll ask you
not to address

23:08.550 --> 23:10.084
the defendant directly.

23:10.149 --> 23:11.852
I'm not the defendant.

23:11.917 --> 23:13.588
This isn't
a criminal trial.

23:13.654 --> 23:15.324
Well, it should be.

23:15.389 --> 23:16.557
Where were we?

23:16.622 --> 23:18.663
You were describing
the deplorable condition

23:18.728 --> 23:20.666
in which you found
Mr. Nesbitt's cat.

23:20.731 --> 23:23.969
Oh, yeah.

23:24.034 --> 23:26.571
Jessica, I've been expecting
your call.

23:26.636 --> 23:28.310
You aren't expecting
<i>this</i> call.

23:28.375 --> 23:30.047
It was pointed out
to me

23:30.112 --> 23:32.247
that I had misplaced
some of my anger.

23:32.312 --> 23:34.150
So I've decided to place
some of it on you.

23:34.215 --> 23:35.886
Then this is the call
I was expecting.

23:35.951 --> 23:38.254
You've heard about Stephen?
I heard about you.

23:38.318 --> 23:40.084
And your deal
with Harvey.

23:41.252 --> 23:42.652
I was wondering
when you'd find out.

23:42.690 --> 23:44.119
Save it.

23:44.184 --> 23:45.516
I thought when I got rid
of Daniel Hardman,

23:45.589 --> 23:47.387
I was done with partners
I couldn't trust.

23:47.452 --> 23:48.955
I assume you're referring
to Harvey

23:49.020 --> 23:51.554
because I'm not the one
who proposed that deal.

23:51.619 --> 23:54.486
Him asking isn't the same
as you accepting.

23:54.552 --> 23:56.053
No, it isn't,
but he was going to quit

23:56.126 --> 23:57.051
because of you.

23:57.124 --> 23:58.783
And that deal
made him stay.

23:58.848 --> 24:01.651
And as you said yourself,
he is essential to the firm.

24:01.716 --> 24:03.418
Not more essential
than me.

24:03.483 --> 24:05.418
And as for your deal
with Harvey,

24:05.491 --> 24:08.154
it doesn't exist because
he doesn't want it anymore.

24:08.227 --> 24:10.625
Which was my hope
from the beginning.

24:10.691 --> 24:13.457
You are a saint,
aren't you?

24:13.530 --> 24:15.268
I'm not sure
I fully understand

24:15.333 --> 24:16.797
the purpose of this call.

24:16.869 --> 24:18.333
I want
Stephen Huntley gone.

24:18.406 --> 24:20.142
I won't allow him to do
any more damage.

24:20.207 --> 24:23.439
When you have a problem,
you turn to Harvey.

24:23.512 --> 24:26.279
Stephen fills that role
for me.

24:26.344 --> 24:28.246
You want him gone?
Win the case.

24:28.311 --> 24:30.213
He'll be on the next
flight out.

24:30.278 --> 24:33.982
Edward, Harvey and I
are going to win this case.

24:34.055 --> 24:37.022
And then you and I are going
to have a conversation

24:37.087 --> 24:40.059
about the future
of this merger.

24:40.124 --> 24:42.522
Ah, now I understand.

24:42.595 --> 24:43.762
What?

24:43.827 --> 24:46.225
By telling you about my part
in his deal,

24:46.298 --> 24:48.192
he's turned you
against the very merger

24:48.264 --> 24:50.261
he never wanted
in the first place.

24:50.326 --> 24:52.490
Harvey had nothing to do
with this.

24:52.563 --> 24:55.297
Hadn't he?

24:55.362 --> 24:59.833
Goodbye, Edward.

25:07.440 --> 25:09.503
You have portrayed yourself

25:09.576 --> 25:12.678
as the kindhearted savior

25:12.743 --> 25:15.109
of this feline soul.

25:15.182 --> 25:17.149
Is that correct?
Yeah.

25:17.214 --> 25:18.894
I believe I've brought out
the best in her.

25:18.917 --> 25:20.717
So you have a way
with your charges?

25:20.782 --> 25:24.258
A velvet glove,
so to speak?

25:24.323 --> 25:25.924
I guess you could say
I'm built that way.

25:25.932 --> 25:27.732
So you're a good parent?

25:27.797 --> 25:29.730
Um, a role model?

25:29.795 --> 25:31.799
No one could
say otherwise.

25:31.864 --> 25:35.267
So if one of your charges
were to say you were hostile,

25:35.340 --> 25:39.678
cruel, prone to kicking
the proverbial dog,

25:39.743 --> 25:41.045
would that be a lie?

25:41.110 --> 25:43.442
My treatment of felines is
what's of issue here.

25:43.515 --> 25:45.082
I thought it was
your parenting skills,

25:45.147 --> 25:46.627
your ability to mold
and shape gently.

25:46.683 --> 25:47.978
But that's not--

25:48.051 --> 25:50.920
This jury knows all about
your parenting skills,

25:50.985 --> 25:53.549
which involve
berating, belittling,

25:53.614 --> 25:55.518
screaming, sadism--

25:55.583 --> 25:57.151
Objection!

25:57.224 --> 25:58.591
You can object
all you like.

25:58.656 --> 26:03.157
But as I said,
this jury knows

26:03.230 --> 26:06.258
that that man is not
what he portrays himself to be.

26:06.323 --> 26:07.690
And what about you?

26:07.763 --> 26:09.361
You think molding and shaping
is accomplished

26:09.426 --> 26:10.832
by abandoning your charges

26:10.897 --> 26:12.263
and sending
the occasional memo

26:12.329 --> 26:15.630
while you're off mudding
in the Yangtze?

26:15.703 --> 26:16.983
I'd like to call
my next witness.

26:17.031 --> 26:17.998
Oh, really?
What witness?

26:18.071 --> 26:19.437
You didn't declare
a witness.

26:19.502 --> 26:21.774
He's a hostile witness.

26:21.839 --> 26:24.808
And I'm afraid he's hostile
to you.

26:24.874 --> 26:28.142
I call Harold Gunderson
to the stand.

26:32.515 --> 26:34.115
Holy shit.
We're in trouble.

26:34.180 --> 26:36.021
We need
a ten-minute recess.

26:39.852 --> 26:41.387
Ah, uh, no, no, Rachel,
I'm sorry,

26:41.452 --> 26:42.689
but I can't talk
right now.

26:42.754 --> 26:45.022
I am typing up Cameron's files
from memory.

26:45.087 --> 26:47.358
Mike, I am going to lose
my first case...

26:47.423 --> 26:48.591
- Uh-huh.
- A mock case...

26:48.656 --> 26:52.499
- Okay.
- About a cat.

26:52.564 --> 26:55.539
Okay, that,
I have a couple of minutes for.

26:55.600 --> 26:57.501
Nigel dug up Harold.

26:57.566 --> 26:58.900
What? He's gonna throw Louis
under the bus.

26:58.965 --> 26:59.900
Which is why I need
your help.

26:59.965 --> 27:01.003
I need you to remember

27:01.068 --> 27:02.866
anything good he said
about Louis.

27:02.931 --> 27:04.969
- I can't.
- What are you talking about?

27:05.034 --> 27:06.370
You were just referring
to your amazing memory.

27:06.435 --> 27:07.915
No, it's not
that I can't remember it.

27:07.940 --> 27:10.312
It's that he never said
anything good.

27:10.385 --> 27:11.616
Oh, my God.
I'm screwed.

27:11.681 --> 27:13.015
I'm so sorry, Rachel,
but I have to go.

27:13.080 --> 27:14.582
What> Are you kidding?
You've got--you've got nothing?

27:14.647 --> 27:16.253
What I have is complete faith
in you.

27:16.318 --> 27:17.820
So say hi to Harold
for me

27:17.885 --> 27:20.753
before you figure out a way
to screw him.

27:20.818 --> 27:22.322
Huh.

27:27.120 --> 27:29.692
Jessica was right.
There's dirt on Nick.

27:29.757 --> 27:30.725
Where'd you get this?

27:30.790 --> 27:32.190
It's courtesy
of Cameron Dennis.

27:32.264 --> 27:33.895
I actually went in there--
Holy shit.

27:33.960 --> 27:35.927
I know, there's enough there
to point the finger at him.

27:35.999 --> 27:38.167
There's enough here to make me
think that he really did it.

27:38.233 --> 27:39.905
So what do
you wanna do?

27:39.970 --> 27:40.969
Go tell Jessica
she was right

27:41.042 --> 27:42.322
and then get Nick Howell
in here.

27:42.373 --> 27:43.340
And make sure he doesn't have
an answer for this

27:43.412 --> 27:44.347
before we get to court.

27:44.412 --> 27:45.347
On it.

27:49.366 --> 27:51.713
Mr. Gunderson,
you are currently

27:51.738 --> 27:53.668
an associate at Bratton Gould.

27:53.669 --> 27:56.606
At what firm
did you previously work?

27:56.671 --> 27:57.878
I worked here.

27:57.943 --> 28:00.206
And who was
your supervisor?

28:00.279 --> 28:01.877
That man, Louis Litt.

28:01.942 --> 28:03.077
Really, Harold?

28:03.150 --> 28:04.877
Let the record show
that Mr. Gunderson

28:04.949 --> 28:06.916
indicated Mr. Litt.

28:06.981 --> 28:10.420
Tell me about
Mr. Litt's guidance.

28:10.486 --> 28:12.285
Louis believes
in teaching by fear.

28:12.358 --> 28:13.790
Your Honor, I'd just like
to state for the record

28:13.855 --> 28:16.136
that the witness is speaking
into an imaginary microphone.

28:16.161 --> 28:17.632
You're speaking into
an imaginary microphone.

28:17.697 --> 28:18.896
- That's what I mean.
- You know what?

28:18.969 --> 28:20.096
Fine, I'm done.
Proceed.

28:20.169 --> 28:23.369
Would you characterize him
as a-a screamer?

28:23.434 --> 28:26.273
A tyrant?
Petty and vindictive?

28:26.338 --> 28:27.778
All of the above.

28:27.843 --> 28:32.055
He didn't try to gently sculpt
your future like blown glass?

28:32.120 --> 28:34.626
He called me an idiot,
an imbecile,

28:34.691 --> 28:36.826
and an embarrassment
to the legal profession.

28:36.891 --> 28:38.162
That sounds harsh.

28:38.227 --> 28:40.427
My therapist says
that I have scars on my psyche.

28:40.500 --> 28:42.403
- Hearsay.
- I could call said therapist.

28:42.468 --> 28:43.731
Oh, that'd be lovely,

28:43.804 --> 28:45.539
except it still has nothing
to do with the cat.

28:45.604 --> 28:48.140
Uh, bear with me.
I'm getting there.

28:48.206 --> 28:52.745
Uh, tell me about Bruno.

28:55.122 --> 28:56.585
He was Louis' cat.

28:56.650 --> 28:58.585
I was made to take care
of him.

28:58.657 --> 29:01.762
- He didn't do it himself?
- No.

29:01.827 --> 29:03.459
Do you like cats, Harold?

29:03.533 --> 29:05.826
No.

29:05.899 --> 29:07.561
I'm allergic.

29:07.634 --> 29:08.800
I don't even know
what to do with them.

29:08.865 --> 29:12.102
But he left this cat,
his cat,

29:12.167 --> 29:13.832
in your care?

29:13.905 --> 29:15.001
What happened?
Hey, you know what?

29:15.074 --> 29:16.474
This would be a good time
to object.

29:16.536 --> 29:18.775
I can't, Louis, it's a valid
line of questioning.

29:18.840 --> 29:22.679
What happened,
Mr. Gunderson?

29:22.744 --> 29:25.050
He died a day later.

29:25.115 --> 29:28.185
And what did he say to you
prior to that day?

29:28.250 --> 29:30.750
He said he might as well
have left his cat

29:30.815 --> 29:31.981
with Michael Vick.

29:41.431 --> 29:42.831
I didn't realize
she'd be here.

29:42.896 --> 29:44.903
Didn't want to look me
in the eye?

29:44.968 --> 29:46.166
Ava, I'm sorry.

29:46.231 --> 29:48.239
I'm glad I can help you
as a character witness.

29:48.304 --> 29:49.871
I had no idea admitting
to the bribe

29:49.936 --> 29:50.944
would lead
to this nonsense.

29:51.009 --> 29:53.514
Solicitation of murder
is nonsense?

29:53.579 --> 29:55.778
You know what I meant,
that Ava would never do that.

29:55.851 --> 29:58.051
Oh, we agree.
We don't think she would.

29:58.116 --> 30:00.754
We think you would.

30:00.819 --> 30:02.489
What? You're trying
to blame the murders on me?

30:02.553 --> 30:04.424
You met with Mariga
before Ava did.

30:04.489 --> 30:06.823
You made the arrangements.
You agreed on the payments.

30:06.888 --> 30:08.455
You know all this.

30:08.527 --> 30:10.422
But we didn't
know this.

30:10.495 --> 30:12.862
Mr. Howell is being shown
a record of deposits

30:12.927 --> 30:14.662
into a numbered
Swiss bank account

30:14.727 --> 30:16.630
opened one week
after the murders.

30:16.695 --> 30:18.431
- How did you get this?
- Are you saying it's not yours?

30:18.504 --> 30:19.432
It's not what it seems.

30:19.504 --> 30:21.103
Then tell us
what it is

30:21.168 --> 30:23.807
because what it looks like
is a split of the take.

30:23.873 --> 30:25.408
How much did Mariga
cut you in for?

30:25.473 --> 30:27.514
- These are bonuses.
- Bonuses?

30:27.579 --> 30:28.683
Part of my deal,

30:28.748 --> 30:30.252
incentive payments
for getting the job done

30:30.317 --> 30:31.621
under hardship conditions.

30:31.686 --> 30:33.157
The only hardship you had
was finding someone

30:33.222 --> 30:34.493
to kill those people.

30:34.558 --> 30:37.357
You split the take with Mariga
then hid your share.

30:37.429 --> 30:39.197
This money didn't come
from Colonel Mariga.

30:39.262 --> 30:41.629
It came from Hessington Oil
and she knows it.

30:41.694 --> 30:43.429
You can't keep pointing
the finger at Ava.

30:43.502 --> 30:44.799
You acted alone on this.

30:44.872 --> 30:47.208
I have emails
asking for her authorization

30:47.273 --> 30:48.640
to make bonus payments.

30:48.705 --> 30:51.607
Those emails didn't mention
Swiss bank accounts.

30:51.680 --> 30:53.447
Because I knew you wouldn't
want them to.

30:53.512 --> 30:54.743
Bullshit.

30:54.816 --> 30:56.511
It didn't mention
Swiss bank accounts

30:56.583 --> 31:00.149
because you went to Mariga
and arranged everything.

31:00.214 --> 31:01.452
I didn't even
know Mariga.

31:01.517 --> 31:03.715
He came to me.
He laid out a bribe.

31:03.788 --> 31:06.053
I accepted it.
And Ava knew everything I did.

31:06.126 --> 31:07.653
- That's a lie.
- She knew.

31:07.726 --> 31:09.461
She just didn't know
the specifics.

31:09.526 --> 31:10.893
And now, you're acting
like this means

31:10.958 --> 31:13.524
that I ordered the killing
of those people.

31:13.597 --> 31:15.500
Well, I didn't.

31:15.563 --> 31:16.897
And if you try to make it look
like I did

31:16.962 --> 31:19.095
without her knowledge,
no jury's ever going

31:19.160 --> 31:22.461
to believe it
because it's not true.

31:30.467 --> 31:32.167
Mr. Gunderson,
your tenure at this law firm

31:32.232 --> 31:33.933
wasn't very successful,
was it?

31:33.998 --> 31:35.364
I worked very hard.

31:35.437 --> 31:36.935
Is it true that you once
failed to deliver

31:37.008 --> 31:38.504
a motion to the court
because you thought

31:38.577 --> 31:40.217
they were closed
due to inclement weather?

31:40.281 --> 31:41.913
Someone told me
that it was a snow day.

31:41.978 --> 31:43.314
Did you ever give
opposing counsel

31:43.379 --> 31:44.849
a copy
of our trial strategy?

31:44.914 --> 31:46.314
I thought it was part
of disclosure.

31:46.386 --> 31:48.584
Did you leave a zero off
the Hopkins settlement,

31:48.649 --> 31:52.352
nearly costing
the client $900,000?

31:54.089 --> 31:55.823
No one was supposed to know
about that.

31:55.896 --> 31:58.126
Because Louis covered
for you.

31:58.191 --> 31:59.694
- He berated me.
- No.

31:59.759 --> 32:00.926
He kept it private.

32:00.999 --> 32:02.631
And he allowed you to go back
and fix it.

32:02.696 --> 32:04.905
Did he not?
He did.

32:04.970 --> 32:06.571
Which allowed you to learn
from your mistakes.

32:06.644 --> 32:08.570
Did it not?
I guess.

32:08.643 --> 32:10.242
You testified that you now
work at Bratton Gould.

32:10.307 --> 32:11.577
Is that correct?
Yes.

32:11.642 --> 32:12.809
And when
they hired you,

32:12.874 --> 32:14.881
did they know you'd been trained
by Louis Litt?

32:14.946 --> 32:16.115
It came up.

32:16.180 --> 32:18.284
So they knew
that you were nurtured by Louis.

32:18.357 --> 32:19.683
They hired you.

32:19.756 --> 32:24.027
And now,
are you happy?

32:24.092 --> 32:25.028
Yes.

32:25.093 --> 32:26.460
So with Louis' nurturance,

32:26.526 --> 32:28.166
your mistakes were covered,

32:28.231 --> 32:29.827
you landed another job,

32:29.900 --> 32:30.826
and you're happy.

32:30.899 --> 32:32.592
Isn't that correct?

32:32.665 --> 32:33.928
But he was mean
to me.

32:34.001 --> 32:36.064
No, this isn't about how
he treated you, Harold.

32:36.137 --> 32:39.302
This is about how he treated
his cat.

32:39.367 --> 32:42.071
And isn't the truth
that he loved that cat

32:42.136 --> 32:46.777
and cared for him
with all of his heart?

32:49.619 --> 32:51.847
Harold, you're under oath.
No, I'm not.

32:51.912 --> 32:55.382
Harold.

32:55.455 --> 32:57.517
Yes, he loved Bruno
with all of his heart.

33:04.430 --> 33:07.293
I have
no further questions.

33:20.309 --> 33:22.907
Hey.

33:22.972 --> 33:26.181
What a lovely surprise.
And I come bearing gifts.

33:26.246 --> 33:27.183
Oh, you didn't have
to do that.

33:27.248 --> 33:28.551
Oh, well,
it's only right.

33:28.616 --> 33:30.151
You've given me
so many things.

33:30.224 --> 33:32.959
And I've never
given you anything.

33:33.024 --> 33:35.360
Well, anything like this.

33:35.425 --> 33:37.359
What is it?

33:37.432 --> 33:40.167
I'm surprised
you don't recognize it.

33:40.232 --> 33:44.071
It's a copy
of Colonel Mariga's deposition.

33:44.136 --> 33:46.503
My copy count didn't reconcile
with the machine.

33:46.568 --> 33:48.934
It was off
by seven pages,

33:49.007 --> 33:53.407
the exact amount of that.

33:53.480 --> 33:56.183
You thought
I wouldn't notice.

33:56.248 --> 33:58.112
I would.

33:58.185 --> 33:59.488
- You spied on me.
- Oh, no.

33:59.554 --> 34:00.985
I trusted you.

34:01.058 --> 34:03.122
- Donna...
- Don't Donna me.

34:03.187 --> 34:06.692
You looked me in the face
and you made me a promise.

34:06.765 --> 34:08.364
I also made a promise
to Edward Darby.

34:08.429 --> 34:10.100
And I made a promise
to Harvey.

34:10.165 --> 34:11.300
And I wouldn't make
another one

34:11.364 --> 34:12.934
if I knew I could only
keep one.

34:13.007 --> 34:15.312
So you're choosing
what you don't have with him

34:15.377 --> 34:16.938
over something that you do have
with me?

34:16.980 --> 34:19.781
This has nothing to do
with him.

34:19.853 --> 34:20.989
I don't care if you said
you'd stay out

34:21.054 --> 34:23.188
of Norma's business
and you went back on it.

34:23.254 --> 34:26.694
You lied to me.

34:26.759 --> 34:30.726
We're done.

34:30.800 --> 34:32.032
Oh.

34:32.097 --> 34:35.369
And by the way,
you're welcome.

34:35.442 --> 34:36.505
For what?

34:36.571 --> 34:39.108
For not telling Harvey
about this.

34:39.181 --> 34:40.245
Because if he found out,

34:40.318 --> 34:41.717
he would beat the shit
outta you.

34:50.895 --> 34:51.855
Watch what you're doing.

34:51.896 --> 34:53.231
I wasn't actually moving.

34:53.295 --> 34:55.928
Yeah, well,
I don't actually care.

34:56.001 --> 34:57.834
- Donna, are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

34:57.907 --> 34:59.307
Hey, Donna.

34:59.372 --> 35:01.204
I don't wanna talk
about it, okay?

35:01.277 --> 35:02.940
You'll tell Harvey.
He'll get furious--

35:03.012 --> 35:04.043
I won't tell Harvey.

35:04.108 --> 35:05.443
Yeah, another promise.

35:05.516 --> 35:08.547
Donna.

35:08.613 --> 35:11.118
He just couldn't keep his nose
out of it.

35:11.191 --> 35:13.328
Who couldn't keep his nose
out of what?

35:13.393 --> 35:17.727
Stephen got
Mariga's deposition.

35:17.792 --> 35:18.726
You know what?

35:18.799 --> 35:20.895
It doesn't matter.

35:20.968 --> 35:23.169
I'm done with him anyway.

35:23.234 --> 35:24.740
I'm so sorry.

35:34.690 --> 35:36.137
Rachel that was amazing.

35:36.138 --> 35:37.831
- Thank you, Louis.
- We're gonna win.

35:38.013 --> 35:41.748
You did win.

35:41.813 --> 35:44.686
Don't worry.
I'm not going to take your cat.

35:44.751 --> 35:45.981
I am a man of honor.

35:46.054 --> 35:47.589
Well, that's very gracious
of you.

35:47.654 --> 35:49.189
In fact, I'm glad
we had this trial

35:49.254 --> 35:50.894
because you and I both know
you didn't win

35:50.958 --> 35:51.990
on the merits
of the case.

35:52.063 --> 35:54.200
You won because
the associates prefer

35:54.265 --> 35:58.398
your tough love
to my light touch.

35:58.462 --> 36:01.837
- Yeah, they do.
- But Mikado belongs with me.

36:01.902 --> 36:03.301
And this trial showed me
there's something

36:03.374 --> 36:06.269
you care about
more than her.

36:06.342 --> 36:08.573
- Nothing.
- Yes.

36:08.646 --> 36:12.075
The associates.

36:12.140 --> 36:16.180
I'm offering you
a settlement.

36:16.245 --> 36:17.180
No.

36:17.253 --> 36:20.555
You get back
the associates.

36:20.620 --> 36:24.386
I get back my cat.
No.

36:24.460 --> 36:26.388
II need a moment to confer
with my client.

36:26.460 --> 36:29.592
Of course.

36:32.424 --> 36:36.170
I do love her, you know?

36:47.177 --> 36:50.819
Louis, as your attorney,
I need to say this...

36:50.884 --> 36:53.752
Please don't
make me choose.

36:53.817 --> 36:56.489
She's Nigel's cat.

36:58.386 --> 37:00.226
You were right.

37:00.291 --> 37:01.596
No one's ever going
to believe

37:01.661 --> 37:04.427
that Ava didn't know
what her number two was up to.

37:04.499 --> 37:06.194
It was worth trying.

37:06.267 --> 37:09.501
It was worth trying
because she really didn't know.

37:09.574 --> 37:11.640
And no one's ever going
to believe it

37:11.713 --> 37:12.977
because she should've known.

37:13.043 --> 37:16.545
Jessica, Ava and Nick
are not the same as you and me.

37:16.618 --> 37:20.452
I know.
They're not.

37:20.525 --> 37:22.958
She didn't wanna know what was
happening under her nose.

37:23.023 --> 37:23.958
I do.

37:24.031 --> 37:24.998
And the only reason

37:25.063 --> 37:26.294
why I didn't see it
this time

37:26.367 --> 37:28.133
is because I never thought
you'd do that to me.

37:28.198 --> 37:30.078
- I didn't do it to you.
- You put it in motion.

37:30.134 --> 37:32.437
And then I stopped it.
And then I told you about it.

37:32.504 --> 37:35.176
What I wanna know
is why.

37:35.241 --> 37:38.111
You coulda just
let it go,

37:38.176 --> 37:40.205
never said a word.

37:40.278 --> 37:42.109
I told you
because enough was enough

37:42.182 --> 37:44.415
and I didn't want anymore
secrets between us.

37:44.481 --> 37:46.585
No, when you cheat on someone
and tell them about it,

37:46.650 --> 37:49.321
it's not to make them
feel better.

37:49.386 --> 37:51.793
It's to make yourself
feel better.

37:51.858 --> 37:53.192
Yeah, unless you think
there's a chance

37:53.257 --> 37:54.424
that they're gonna
find out.

37:54.497 --> 37:56.064
Or you think
telling them

37:56.129 --> 37:59.096
is going to make them
wanna get out of their merger.

37:59.161 --> 38:01.233
I guess we've stopped
with the cheating analogy.

38:01.298 --> 38:03.569
Yes, we have.

38:03.634 --> 38:07.040
Now, did you come clean
to heal our relationship

38:07.105 --> 38:10.345
or to make me want out
of the merger?

38:10.410 --> 38:12.880
Like I just
told you,

38:12.945 --> 38:15.543
I did it because I didn't want
to keep anymore secrets.

38:15.616 --> 38:17.151
But I have never kept it
a secret

38:17.216 --> 38:18.814
that I want out
of this merger.

38:18.886 --> 38:20.414
You didn't answer
the question.

38:20.487 --> 38:22.720
Okay, if you're asking
if I knew

38:22.793 --> 38:27.296
that coming clean about Darby
would make you furious with him,

38:27.361 --> 38:28.827
I'd be lying
if I didn't say

38:28.900 --> 38:29.835
it crossed my mind.

38:29.900 --> 38:31.067
So you set me up.

38:31.132 --> 38:33.036
No, all I did
is what you've taught me to do

38:33.101 --> 38:34.669
for a long time.

38:34.742 --> 38:36.006
And it didn't change
your mind.

38:36.079 --> 38:39.943
It just put you in touch
with what you already felt.

38:43.517 --> 38:45.315
You really could be
managing partner.

38:45.380 --> 38:47.345
But I'm not.

38:47.418 --> 38:50.954
And I don't
wanna be.

38:51.019 --> 38:55.458
So...

38:55.523 --> 38:59.532
What are we gonna do
about this trial?

39:00.902 --> 39:03.270
As much as Mikado
means to you,

39:03.335 --> 39:05.205
I know the associates
mean more.

39:05.270 --> 39:07.942
No, not more.

39:08.007 --> 39:12.619
The needs of the many outweigh
the needs of one.

39:12.684 --> 39:14.819
- What philosopher said that?
- Spock.

39:14.884 --> 39:17.187
<i>The Wrath of Khan?</i>

39:17.252 --> 39:19.525
I will take her back
to Nigel for you.

39:19.590 --> 39:22.928
Well, thanks for doing this
for me, Rachel.

39:23.001 --> 39:26.703
But I want to do something
for you first,

39:26.768 --> 39:31.578
a reward of sorts
for your victory.

39:31.643 --> 39:33.275
See, I was right to pick you
to be my lawyer.

39:33.347 --> 39:37.482
And as it turns out,

39:37.546 --> 39:41.487
Columbia Law School agrees.

39:41.552 --> 39:42.583
Louis, what--

39:42.649 --> 39:43.889
I saw it on mail cart
this morning.

39:43.954 --> 39:46.993
I wanted to save it
for you.

39:48.560 --> 39:51.620
Congratulations, Rachel.
You're gonna be a lawyer.

39:53.693 --> 39:54.629
A real lawyer.

40:01.301 --> 40:03.500
- Donna, where's Harvey?
- He's with Jessica.

40:03.573 --> 40:04.667
Where?
They're not in her office.

40:04.740 --> 40:05.738
- They're on the roof.
- Okay.

40:05.803 --> 40:06.937
Get them down here
right now.

40:07.002 --> 40:08.104
- Mike, what's wrong?
- I said now.

40:08.169 --> 40:09.569
Mike.

40:09.642 --> 40:10.642
What's wrong?

40:10.707 --> 40:11.746
I know why Stephen needed
to know

40:11.811 --> 40:13.841
what Mariga said
in his deposition.

40:13.914 --> 40:15.208
Why?

40:15.281 --> 40:19.384
He was afraid that Mariga
would tell the truth.

40:19.449 --> 40:23.384
Stephen was the one
who ordered those killings.

40:31.258 --> 40:32.991
Emmanuel Mariga
20 years ago

40:33.064 --> 40:35.564
at the University of Cape Town
as an Econ major.

40:35.629 --> 40:37.059
Always had a head
for business.

40:37.132 --> 40:39.628
He was also
on the rugby team.

40:39.701 --> 40:41.599
You know who else played rugby?
Stephen Huntley.

40:41.672 --> 40:43.472
Stephen's record
from Cambridge included

40:43.538 --> 40:47.541
a semester abroad
at the University of Cape Town.

40:47.606 --> 40:50.474
That year's team.

40:50.539 --> 40:52.577
They had
a hell of a season.

40:52.642 --> 40:53.945
They're still
a team.

40:54.010 --> 40:54.945
Darby was clear.

40:55.010 --> 40:56.145
Whenever he has
a problem,

40:56.210 --> 40:57.882
Stephen's the one
he sends in to fix it.

40:57.947 --> 40:59.345
And Ava's problem
was his problem.

40:59.418 --> 41:01.110
So when she came to him
to get her pipeline built--

41:01.183 --> 41:02.182
He went to Stephen.

41:02.247 --> 41:03.118
And you wanna know
what it took

41:03.183 --> 41:04.349
to set up
those murders?

41:04.414 --> 41:06.453
One phone call
to Mariga,

41:06.519 --> 41:08.317
from the offices
of Darby International,

41:08.390 --> 41:10.620
from Stephen Huntley's
London office.

41:10.693 --> 41:12.985
From there, Mariga calls Nick,
Nick calls Ava,

41:13.058 --> 41:14.321
and the whole thing is set
in motion.

41:14.386 --> 41:15.793
They thought they were paying
for a bribe.

41:15.858 --> 41:17.056
But they were actually paying
for murder.

41:17.121 --> 41:18.482
And they never knew
the connection.

41:18.488 --> 41:20.293
And when Ava's about to be
charged for murder,

41:20.358 --> 41:23.810
Stephen shows up to make sure
we'd never find out.

41:23.861 --> 41:27.147
I'm so sorry, harvey.

41:34.688 --> 41:35.739
Harvey.

41:35.823 --> 41:38.858
Harvey, what are
you gonna do?

42:01.215 --> 42:05.068
Ah!
