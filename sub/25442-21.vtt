You know, suck it up.
Fashion hurts.

Yeah. This is
your mother's first

00:20.500 --> 00:22.460
Her design's

Hey, Nia. People donated
more prizes to the raffle.

Great. Let's hope this box
has better stuff.

00:53.250 --> 00:54.380
It doesn't.

He's got like, what,
nine million followers?

02:14.580 --> 02:16.500

I booked him.

drop you off at a party

05:12.120 --> 05:15.170

"Make good choices!"

05:15.170 --> 05:17.880

05:43.040 --> 05:44.380
Mind if I tag you?

05:44.380 --> 05:47.040

05:47.040 --> 05:48.080
-Yeah.
-Please.

05:48.080 --> 05:49.080

I'm gonna call that
my beachwear line.

you gonna ask him

his hat selfie first.

Sounds great.

Well, listen,
Mr. MeTube,

17:54.250 --> 17:56.380
you might tell
nine million followers
to keep it real,

17:56.380 --> 17:58.460
but you need
your mama to tell you
how to keep it real.

17:58.460 --> 18:00.460
-Preach, mama.
-Oh, I'm preachin', girl.

18:00.460 --> 18:02.540
But if you wanna
get in on this sermon,
you go ahead.

18:02.540 --> 18:04.540
Oh, I'll sing in
the choir on this one.
(sings note)

18:04.540 --> 18:05.710
Listen here, Lil Z,

18:05.710 --> 18:07.960
now I taught
my kids to keep
it straight with people

18:07.960 --> 18:09.580
and they weren't with you.

18:09.580 --> 18:11.500
That was wrong.
And there's no excuse
for that.

18:11.500 --> 18:13.920
But you made a commitment
to this lady here.

18:13.920 --> 18:15.750
And it'd be wrong of you
not to honor it.
