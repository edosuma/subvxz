WEBVTT

00:03.176 --> 00:05.810
It's your first day
of college. Good luck!

00:07.213 --> 00:08.514
Hi there.

00:10.216 --> 00:11.616
I became a Christian again.

00:11.684 --> 00:13.584
Nothing we did that
night in the science lab

00:13.652 --> 00:14.919
could have caused an explosion.

00:14.986 --> 00:15.986
Stay away from Dylan.

00:16.055 --> 00:17.355
Don't you recognize me?

00:17.423 --> 00:19.790
I'm really sorry, no. Clementine?

00:19.858 --> 00:21.559
She's a girl I lived
with in foster care.

00:21.626 --> 00:23.094
We were at the same
house for not even a year.

00:23.162 --> 00:24.862
I have something to
tell you. What's that?

00:24.930 --> 00:26.464
The divorce papers came through.

00:26.532 --> 00:28.666
I'm not sure Ethan is
capable of being a friend.

00:28.733 --> 00:30.701
I'm sick of sitting around
the house with my grandmother.

00:30.769 --> 00:32.836
I want to be with your mother
for the rest of my life.

00:32.904 --> 00:34.004
And I'm telling you that now,

00:34.072 --> 00:35.205
so you won't be surprised
if things work out.

00:35.273 --> 00:36.206
We might even go to church.

00:36.274 --> 00:37.307
I slept with Alice.

00:37.375 --> 00:38.676
How the hell did that happen?

00:38.743 --> 00:39.877
Henry doesn't know.

00:39.945 --> 00:41.078
I still love you,

00:41.145 --> 00:42.680
and I still want to have sex with you.

00:42.747 --> 00:46.916
We could still make out and fool
around a little, just no sex.

00:46.984 --> 00:49.418
Your parents want to have
a traditional Indian wedding

00:49.486 --> 00:50.753
and come in on elephants.

00:50.821 --> 00:52.354
We are not having a wedding.

00:52.422 --> 00:55.091
You tell your mom that
and I'll tell mine.

00:55.158 --> 00:56.292
Who are you talking to?

00:56.359 --> 00:57.293
You met someone?

00:57.360 --> 00:58.962
I think I did.

01:04.700 --> 01:05.901
(BURPS)

01:07.269 --> 01:09.605
You are the coolest girl I ever met.

01:09.672 --> 01:12.273
Thanks. Couldn't help that.

01:12.341 --> 01:14.476
You have to get used to

01:14.543 --> 01:17.678
noises when you're carrying
this much weight on your gut.

01:17.746 --> 01:19.546
I'm just glad it wasn't something worse.

01:19.615 --> 01:21.482
Hey, feel free to be yourself.

01:21.549 --> 01:24.952
Go back to what you were talking
about, the guy stabbed you?

01:25.020 --> 01:26.386
Oh, my dad?

01:26.454 --> 01:28.856
Yeah. Just in the calf.

01:28.924 --> 01:31.025
He was lecturing me while
he was eating an apple,

01:31.093 --> 01:32.926
he was cutting slices, you know?

01:32.994 --> 01:34.227
I just got tired of hearing him talk,

01:34.294 --> 01:36.029
he was just going on and on and on,

01:36.097 --> 01:37.864
he was stoned out of his mind.

01:39.299 --> 01:41.768
So I turned and walked
off and he threw the knife

01:41.836 --> 01:45.505
like he was playing mumblety-peg.
Only it stuck in my leg.

01:45.572 --> 01:48.108
Fourteen stitches, right here, see?

01:48.175 --> 01:49.207
It left a scar.

01:49.275 --> 01:51.543
Where was your mom when
all this was going on?

01:51.611 --> 01:54.013
The last time I saw her, I was eight

01:54.080 --> 01:57.750
and she said she was going down
to the corner to buy frozen peas.

01:57.817 --> 01:59.417
She left and never came back.

01:59.485 --> 02:02.287
We never really ate peas in our house,

02:02.355 --> 02:04.489
but I was eight, I never suspected.

02:04.557 --> 02:07.258
See, that's what I don't want to do,

02:07.325 --> 02:09.693
go out for peas and
then never come back.

02:11.864 --> 02:14.932
I want the baby to have a mom and a dad

02:15.000 --> 02:17.601
and a safe place to live
with responsible people.

02:17.670 --> 02:19.671
Are you going to be involved
in your kid's life at all,

02:19.738 --> 02:21.437
you know, go to birthday parties

02:21.505 --> 02:22.706
holiday events, that kind of thing?

02:22.774 --> 02:24.941
No.

02:25.009 --> 02:27.510
Isn't that going to be hard, on her
birthday and at Christmas and stuff?

02:27.578 --> 02:29.746
I can see her if I want,

02:29.814 --> 02:32.348
her mom and dad told me I could. But...

02:33.317 --> 02:34.985
I think that's weird.

02:35.053 --> 02:38.520
"Hi. I'm your birth
mommy. Merry Christmas.

02:38.588 --> 02:41.757
"I gave you a more responsible
mommy when you were born.

02:41.825 --> 02:46.062
"But I still like to drop by and
disrupt everyone's life whenever I can.

02:46.129 --> 02:47.730
"Bye-bye."

02:47.798 --> 02:49.765
No, I'm not going to do that.

02:49.833 --> 02:53.735
I'm sure it's fine for
some people but for me, no.

02:54.737 --> 02:56.871
My role in life is just to

02:56.939 --> 02:59.373
give this couple the baby
they can't have on their own.

02:59.441 --> 03:01.810
So tell me about your boyfriend.

03:02.678 --> 03:05.346
He was older than me, 17.

03:05.414 --> 03:06.981
A real brainiac.

03:07.049 --> 03:09.983
We met at a spelling bee. We
both made it to the state finals.

03:10.051 --> 03:11.484
Couldn't spell prophylactic?

03:11.552 --> 03:16.790
Very funny.
P-R-O-P-H-Y-L-A...

03:16.858 --> 03:18.158
(KNOCKING)

03:21.963 --> 03:22.896
Hello.

03:22.964 --> 03:25.098
Cookie?

03:25.165 --> 03:27.333
What are you doing in my car?

03:27.400 --> 03:29.135
Give me the keys. Right now.

03:29.203 --> 03:30.703
I need those to roll up the window.

03:30.771 --> 03:33.773
Roll up the windows
and get out of my car.

03:33.841 --> 03:36.308
What time is your grandmother
picking you up, Kathy?

03:36.376 --> 03:37.810
Whenever I call her.

03:37.878 --> 03:39.912
Call her.

03:39.980 --> 03:44.182
And don't get those crumbs in my
car, and don't spill that milk.

03:44.250 --> 03:45.316
Sorry, we knew you'd gone to bed

03:45.384 --> 03:47.685
and we didn't want to
wake you up talking.

03:47.754 --> 03:49.354
We just want some privacy.

03:54.894 --> 03:56.862
(WHISPERING) I think I'm
going to have to go inside.

04:04.770 --> 04:08.172
Don't forget you have
to get up early tomorrow.

04:08.240 --> 04:12.109
Amy and Ricky are picking you
up and dropping John off here.

04:12.177 --> 04:16.212
And you know what, Kathy,
maybe you should go with them.

04:16.281 --> 04:18.248
It can be a double date.

04:18.315 --> 04:20.850
Yeah, okay. If Ethan wants me to.

04:20.918 --> 04:23.520
If Ethan wants you to?

04:23.588 --> 04:25.188
You can't make up your own mind about

04:25.256 --> 04:28.659
what you want to do and
what you don't want to do?

04:28.726 --> 04:31.694
You're going to just go along
with whatever this guy wants?

04:31.762 --> 04:34.430
Well, it's kind of weird

04:34.498 --> 04:36.965
for a guy's mother to ask me
out to go out on a date with him,

04:37.033 --> 04:40.068
but okay, I'll go. I guess.

04:40.136 --> 04:41.771
Good.

04:41.838 --> 04:43.172
See you tomorrow.

04:46.309 --> 04:47.275
Nice robe.

04:47.343 --> 04:49.411
Get out of my car and lock it!

04:49.478 --> 04:52.480
And it better be as clean as I left it.

04:57.753 --> 05:01.289
Okay. I texted my
grandmother. She's on the way.

05:03.725 --> 05:06.027
Oh, God.

05:06.094 --> 05:08.930
You're not going to kiss me or
anything stupid like that, are you?

05:08.997 --> 05:10.798
I thought we were just friends.

05:10.866 --> 05:13.534
Yeah. Just friends.

Whoa! Look who's here! It's my buddy.

05:45.198 --> 05:46.966
I'm so happy you guys decided to come.

05:47.033 --> 05:48.700
Are you? Does my tie look okay?

05:48.768 --> 05:50.268
I hope the roof doesn't fall in.

05:52.371 --> 05:54.572
George Juergens. You bought a
dinette from me a couple of years ago.

05:54.639 --> 05:55.806
Slightly damaged.

05:55.875 --> 05:57.909
George and I were married before.

05:57.977 --> 05:59.677
Before Jeff?

05:59.745 --> 06:02.580
Before Jeff and before Marshall.

06:02.647 --> 06:03.681
Oh.

06:05.885 --> 06:07.752
Enjoy the sermon.

06:07.819 --> 06:09.453
Thanks, you, too.

06:12.391 --> 06:13.624
George! Not in church.

06:13.692 --> 06:15.626
I don't care, do you
care? No, not that much.

06:17.295 --> 06:19.162
Will Jack be joining us?

06:19.230 --> 06:21.866
I'm hoping. You know they
lost the game yesterday?

06:21.933 --> 06:24.000
I heard. I bet he shows up.

06:36.246 --> 06:37.881
Where have you been?
I'm in there all alone.

06:37.948 --> 06:40.516
And I'm Buddhist. I'm
really not comfortable here.

06:40.583 --> 06:42.183
Did somebody say something to you?

06:42.251 --> 06:43.786
Does someone in there
know you're Buddhist?

06:43.853 --> 06:46.187
No. It's just... There's no ambiance.

06:46.255 --> 06:48.223
There's no incense,

06:48.291 --> 06:50.959
there's no art or statues or anything.

06:51.027 --> 06:53.995
Yeah, I'm Catholic. I'd like
some statues and art, too.

06:54.063 --> 06:55.930
Yeah, but what I've seen of Christian
art, it's a little depressing.

06:55.997 --> 06:57.998
You're right. You know what I never got?

06:58.066 --> 07:00.535
Why we always see Christ
at his worst moment.

07:00.602 --> 07:03.370
Why the crucifixion? Why not
the loaves of bread and wine?

07:03.439 --> 07:05.039
That would have made a better picture.

07:05.106 --> 07:06.240
You could hang that in your kitchen.

07:06.308 --> 07:07.708
Both of you, stop.

07:07.776 --> 07:10.311
It's just that the
crucifixion is so personal,

07:10.378 --> 07:12.078
his clothes are falling off

07:12.146 --> 07:14.448
and there's blood all over
his head and it's scary.

07:14.515 --> 07:16.750
I may not be a religious person,

07:16.818 --> 07:19.786
but I think the crucifixion
is the most significant moment.

07:19.854 --> 07:21.087
That's why they chose it.

07:21.155 --> 07:22.589
Shouldn't it be the
coming back to life moment?

07:22.657 --> 07:24.257
Stop, I beg you.

07:24.325 --> 07:26.292
We're not here for the two
of you, we are here for me.

07:26.360 --> 07:28.928
And now that we're here,

07:28.996 --> 07:31.864
what if he knows that I'm here to
score some points with the school board?

07:31.932 --> 07:33.566
Who's "he"? He.

07:33.633 --> 07:35.534
You know. Him.

07:36.903 --> 07:38.171
If you're not a religious person,

07:38.238 --> 07:40.173
why do you care what
he thinks about you?

07:40.240 --> 07:42.175
I'm also here because I
thought it might impress my dad

07:42.242 --> 07:43.475
and Dylan's parents.

07:43.542 --> 07:45.577
No. No more Dylan.

07:45.644 --> 07:47.312
Your dad said to keep you away from her.

07:47.380 --> 07:48.580
Well, you know how that works,

07:48.647 --> 07:50.415
once something is absolutely forbidden,

07:50.483 --> 07:51.916
I just want to do it all the more.

07:51.984 --> 07:53.751
Okay, seriously, I say we go.

07:57.957 --> 07:59.757
Maybe I should go check in the back.

07:59.825 --> 08:01.092
He'll be here. I'm sure they'll be here.

08:07.665 --> 08:10.868
Hi, Grace. Hi. Welcome, everyone.

08:10.935 --> 08:12.703
- Yeah. Thanks.
- Okay, come on, Ethan,

08:12.770 --> 08:13.871
you better make your
way up to the front,

08:13.938 --> 08:15.472
just take a seat behind the organ.

08:15.540 --> 08:18.675
So, it's an organ.
It's not a piano? Right.

08:18.743 --> 08:21.512
It's a real organ? Not a synthesizer?

08:21.579 --> 08:22.812
Yeah, that's okay, isn't it?

08:22.880 --> 08:25.047
Yeah, sure.

08:25.115 --> 08:28.217
I might be a little rusty,
but I've played one before.

08:28.284 --> 08:29.652
At a hockey game.

08:30.754 --> 08:31.854
See you later.

08:35.759 --> 08:38.193
I see my dad's here. You invited my dad?

08:38.260 --> 08:40.695
He actually invited himself.
He really wanted to come.

08:41.998 --> 08:43.765
You didn't know? No. I didn't know.

08:49.805 --> 08:52.306
We'll just sit in the back.

08:52.374 --> 08:53.575
Anywhere you guys want.

09:02.784 --> 09:03.851
I didn't know they were coming.

09:03.919 --> 09:05.318
No, I didn't realize either.

09:05.386 --> 09:08.155
And I know that Grace
recommended that Ethan fill in,

09:08.222 --> 09:10.457
but sorry. Should we
go back and say hello?

09:10.525 --> 09:13.059
No, maybe not. We can say
hello when we're leaving.

09:13.126 --> 09:15.528
I don't believe this.

09:15.596 --> 09:18.230
He never went to church with my mother.

09:18.298 --> 09:19.599
Did your mother go to church?

09:19.667 --> 09:21.935
No. But he could have
taken her to church.

09:22.002 --> 09:23.536
I haven't been here in years.

09:23.604 --> 09:24.671
When were you here?

09:24.738 --> 09:27.573
Uh, when I was friends with Grace.

09:27.640 --> 09:29.207
You mean when you dated Grace?

09:29.275 --> 09:30.442
You dated Grace?

09:30.509 --> 09:32.711
That was before we were
married. Amy and me.

09:32.779 --> 09:34.613
Yeah. Hey, speaking of married.

09:34.681 --> 09:36.982
When are you going to tell your
mother that you don't want a wedding?

09:37.050 --> 09:39.184
Why don't you tell your mom
you don't want a wedding?

09:39.251 --> 09:40.886
Didn't you have a wedding already?

09:40.954 --> 09:43.788
Yeah. Because she's in Italy.

09:43.855 --> 09:45.522
This is getting ridiculous.

09:48.393 --> 09:49.961
(SCOFFS)

09:50.028 --> 09:52.196
First my dad, now her.

09:52.263 --> 09:54.031
It's like the end of
the world is coming.

09:54.099 --> 09:55.866
This is a church.

09:55.934 --> 09:58.135
This is where people
come to worship God.

09:58.203 --> 09:59.636
There's usually some singing

09:59.704 --> 10:01.504
but no dancing, no making out.

10:01.572 --> 10:03.139
I've been to church before.

10:03.207 --> 10:04.340
Yeah.

10:07.244 --> 10:11.047
Excuse me, could you take
a picture of us, please?

10:11.115 --> 10:12.649
What's this for? Your mother.

10:12.717 --> 10:14.350
So you can tell her I go to church.

10:14.418 --> 10:15.851
We're not telling her we're at church.

10:15.919 --> 10:18.221
If we were going to church, we
should have gone to her church.

10:18.288 --> 10:19.989
Did you want a video or a photo?

10:20.056 --> 10:21.491
Oh. A photo.

10:23.227 --> 10:24.393
(CLICKS)

10:26.163 --> 10:28.564
Ooh. We look good together.

10:28.632 --> 10:31.733
Oh, and if the school board thinks
you were with me just for the sex,

10:31.800 --> 10:33.735
this could also be
presented as evidence.

10:33.802 --> 10:35.903
Of what?

10:35.971 --> 10:37.272
You're done here.

10:37.340 --> 10:40.208
You said "sex."

10:40.276 --> 10:43.411
We're in church and you said "sex."

10:43.479 --> 10:45.180
Oh, like Jesus never had sex?

10:46.715 --> 10:48.349
Never?

10:48.416 --> 10:50.651
Oh, come on. He never married.

10:50.718 --> 10:52.386
And?

10:52.454 --> 10:55.856
This was a good choice, coming
here and not my mother's church.

10:55.923 --> 10:58.459
When is it going to start?

10:58.527 --> 11:01.495
I want to get this over with.

11:01.563 --> 11:03.996
You think I have time to say
hello to Amy? Maybe I should.

11:04.064 --> 11:05.565
Yeah. Sure.

11:05.633 --> 11:06.966
Oh, look. There's Jack's dad.

11:13.674 --> 11:15.608
Psst!

11:15.676 --> 11:16.609
Hi there.

11:16.677 --> 11:18.077
Yeah. Hi.

11:18.145 --> 11:19.878
Reverend Stone. You're Ethan?

11:21.447 --> 11:23.148
Don't be nervous. It's an easy gig.

11:23.216 --> 11:25.551
And a very forgiving crowd
if anything goes wrong.

11:25.618 --> 11:26.785
Okay.

11:27.820 --> 11:30.088
So, any time now.

11:30.156 --> 11:31.490
Any time.

11:34.194 --> 11:36.460
Oh, come on. Get the show on the road.

be a seventh inning stretch.

12:24.362 --> 12:27.899
Mom says let's eat.

12:27.966 --> 12:29.300
I'm not hungry.

12:29.367 --> 12:30.567
I am.

12:30.635 --> 12:33.337
Well, then, eat without me.

12:33.405 --> 12:34.838
Forget about that guy!

12:34.906 --> 12:36.006
I can't!

12:36.941 --> 12:41.211
Grace, it'll be okay.

12:41.279 --> 12:42.512
No, it won't!

12:42.579 --> 12:44.380
Please, Tom, can you
just leave me alone?

12:44.448 --> 12:46.883
I really want to be alone.

12:46.951 --> 12:48.952
Wait, I don't really want to be alone.

12:49.020 --> 12:51.086
I'm sick of being alone. And being
a Christian at our high school

12:51.154 --> 12:53.022
is the loneliest place on earth!

12:53.089 --> 12:55.157
What are you talking
about? You have friends.

12:55.225 --> 12:57.559
I have no friends and
I have no boyfriend!

13:03.166 --> 13:04.733
Maybe I should just go.

13:04.801 --> 13:07.235
Go where? I cooked lunch for all of us.

13:07.303 --> 13:09.137
Yeah, I don't think Grace is in the mood

13:09.205 --> 13:10.872
for a big family
get-together right now.

13:10.940 --> 13:13.041
I don't think you're in
the mood. What's wrong?

13:13.108 --> 13:14.642
No, I am. I'm just...

13:14.710 --> 13:16.978
Uh-oh. You're just...

13:17.046 --> 13:18.346
I'm just feeling a little weird.

13:18.413 --> 13:20.281
I should have told Amy
we were going to church.

13:20.349 --> 13:21.549
It's the first time
she's seen us together

13:21.616 --> 13:22.650
and I think I might have upset her.

13:22.718 --> 13:24.318
I'm just going to go talk to her.

13:24.385 --> 13:26.453
Couldn't you talk to her a little
bit later? teter we've eaten?

13:26.520 --> 13:28.421
Yeah, I could. I guess. I don't know.

13:28.489 --> 13:29.923
I just feel like seeing her.

13:29.991 --> 13:31.624
You and I have been around your children

13:31.692 --> 13:33.126
and we haven't spent
any time around mine.

13:33.194 --> 13:36.496
Yeah, well, two out of three
of your children are in Italy.

13:36.564 --> 13:39.165
Yeah, and one of them's here and
we haven't really been including Amy

13:39.233 --> 13:40.699
or her family when we get together.

13:40.767 --> 13:42.434
Call them,eeee if they
want to come eat with us.

13:42.502 --> 13:44.036
There's plenty for everybody.

13:44.104 --> 13:45.738
Nah, I think I'm just gonna go home,

13:45.805 --> 13:48.040
let you and Tom and Grace
have some time together.

13:48.108 --> 13:49.942
All right,

13:50.010 --> 13:51.810
if that's what you want to do.

13:51.879 --> 13:53.412
I'll call you.

13:57.783 --> 13:59.117
(SIGHS)

14:01.420 --> 14:03.221
Thanks for keeping John for us.

14:03.289 --> 14:05.423
Any time, Son, any time.

14:05.491 --> 14:07.658
Look, I got to tell you something.

14:08.361 --> 14:10.461
Okay, go ahead.

14:10.529 --> 14:13.264
Amy and I...

14:13.331 --> 14:15.832
Well, Amy and I...

14:15.901 --> 14:16.733
You're having another baby?

14:16.801 --> 14:18.468
No.

14:18.536 --> 14:21.438
Oh, good. Your mother heard a rumor.

14:21.506 --> 14:23.740
We didn't think so, but...

14:23.808 --> 14:25.142
What did you want to tell me?

14:25.210 --> 14:27.110
It's just that we eloped because...

14:27.177 --> 14:28.811
Amy wanted to, I heard.

14:28.879 --> 14:30.546
We both wanted to.

14:30.614 --> 14:32.081
Nevertheless, it was her idea.

14:32.149 --> 14:33.682
But it's gonna be one person's
idea or the other, right,

14:33.750 --> 14:35.919
so who cares?

14:35.986 --> 14:39.155
Your mother and I always wondered
if you'd settle down and get married.

14:41.058 --> 14:42.858
We're very happy for you.

14:42.926 --> 14:44.592
And you're our only son,

14:44.660 --> 14:47.329
and we really do want to give
you a spectacular wedding.

14:47.397 --> 14:49.064
Dad, 500 people?

14:49.132 --> 14:51.666
Tents and elephants and...

14:51.734 --> 14:54.937
It makes for nice memories that
you'll keep for the rest of your life.

14:55.004 --> 14:57.005
But I'm going to keep Amy
for the rest of my life.

14:57.073 --> 15:00.608
I don't want a big
wedding. We had a wedding.

15:00.676 --> 15:02.076
We sure did. We should show him the DVD.

15:02.144 --> 15:04.612
We should, but we can't.

15:04.680 --> 15:05.846
Why not?

15:05.914 --> 15:08.415
Right. I totally forgot.

15:08.483 --> 15:10.751
John broke it up into a
bunch of little pieces.

15:10.819 --> 15:12.218
Can't you get a copy?

15:12.286 --> 15:14.154
No. I tried.

15:14.221 --> 15:15.889
I think John is up.

15:15.957 --> 15:19.125
I'll get him. Amy wanted to
talk to you about the wedding.

15:19.193 --> 15:21.861
I want to talk to her? I thought
you wanted to talk to her.

15:25.599 --> 15:27.867
Well, I'll leave you two women to talk.

15:29.436 --> 15:31.437
So? The wedding?

15:31.505 --> 15:35.174
Who can think about a wedding
after such a delicious meal?

15:35.241 --> 15:36.542
Amy,

15:37.643 --> 15:39.478
why don't you just say it?

15:39.545 --> 15:42.447
YoYou want your mother to
give you a wedding, not us?

15:42.515 --> 15:46.017
Actually I don't. I just don't
know how to get out of it.

15:46.085 --> 15:47.819
Why don't you let me talk to her?

15:49.154 --> 15:51.055
Margaret,

15:51.123 --> 15:54.458
I can't say yes to you and no to my mom.

15:54.526 --> 15:56.293
I can't, we can't.

15:56.361 --> 15:57.995
We just don't know what to do.

15:58.062 --> 16:00.598
Well, this is good.

16:00.665 --> 16:03.667
I'm happy that you are
being so direct with me.

16:03.735 --> 16:05.603
I really appreciate that, Amy.

16:05.670 --> 16:10.874
So, maybe your mother
and I can join forces

16:10.941 --> 16:12.642
and  t this together.

16:12.710 --> 16:15.979
I'm sure she'd understand if you
said to her what you said to me.

16:16.046 --> 16:19.983
We both want you to have a day

16:20.050 --> 16:23.620
with your friends and your family
to celebrate your commitment.

16:23.687 --> 16:25.921
It's exciting. We're happy for you.

16:25.989 --> 16:28.256
I have to tell you something.

16:28.324 --> 16:30.792
And I feel like a total idiot.

16:30.860 --> 16:33.962
But I just can't hide this any longer.

16:34.030 --> 16:36.798
I don't want my mother at my wedding.

16:39.335 --> 16:41.969
And it's not because she's gay.

16:42.037 --> 16:45.305
It's because she's not
the mother I grew up with.

16:45.373 --> 16:46.641
I don't care if she's gay,

16:46.708 --> 16:49.710
but I care if she
doesn't seem like my mom.

16:53.348 --> 16:55.750
I feel like I don't even know her.

16:55.817 --> 16:58.952
And we used to be so close.

16:59.020 --> 17:02.221
She's not with my dad
and he's not with her.

17:02.289 --> 17:04.390
He's with Kathleen!

17:04.458 --> 17:07.426
I didn't even know they were
going to be at church together

17:07.493 --> 17:10.564
and they didn't even speak
to me. They just waved

17:10.631 --> 17:13.632
and then they ran out
to see about Grace.

17:13.700 --> 17:17.803
He's my dad and he ran
out to see about Grace.

17:19.405 --> 17:21.473
She's not his daughter.
I'm his daughter.

17:21.540 --> 17:23.508
And I know that he loves me, but...

17:25.679 --> 17:28.313
Really?

17:28.381 --> 17:31.749
He just went right
past me to get to her,

17:31.817 --> 17:34.418
as if he's in their family,

17:34.486 --> 17:35.587
not our family.

17:40.358 --> 17:43.461
And it's because

17:43.528 --> 17:47.430
our family...

17:47.498 --> 17:49.967
r r family doesn't exist anymore.

17:52.269 --> 17:55.338
I don't have a family.

17:55.406 --> 17:59.843
(SIGHS) Amy, sweetheart,

17:59.911 --> 18:02.578
you have your own family now.

18:02.646 --> 18:07.116
And you still have your mom and your dad

18:07.183 --> 18:09.218
and your sister and your little brother.

18:09.285 --> 18:12.054
They're all still your family.

18:12.122 --> 18:15.224
And Nora and Shakur and me,

18:15.291 --> 18:17.826
we're all your family, too,

18:17.893 --> 18:20.461
so don't cry, sweetheart.

18:21.563 --> 18:24.432
I just... I don't know.

18:27.069 --> 18:30.371
I'm just...

18:30.439 --> 18:32.340
I don't think I'm old enough

18:32.407 --> 18:36.110
to have a family of
my own and be married.

18:36.177 --> 18:39.613
It feels ridiculous. I'm in high school.

18:43.818 --> 18:47.021
This is so stupid. I
can't believe I'm crying.

18:47.088 --> 18:50.990
Amy, when two people get married,

18:51.058 --> 18:54.127
even when they're sure
during the wedding,

18:54.161 --> 18:57.830
a couple of weeks later, they
have what they call in real estate

18:57.898 --> 19:00.099
"buyer's remorse."

19:00.167 --> 19:03.469
But that doesn't mean
that you don't love Ricky.

19:03.537 --> 19:06.905
It just means that you're
going through a lot right now,

19:06.939 --> 19:10.075
a lot of changes. This is a big change.

19:10.143 --> 19:12.711
You were living together before,

19:12.779 --> 19:14.379
but saying "I do"

19:14.446 --> 19:18.750
means that you're gonna be living
together for the rest of your lives.

19:18.818 --> 19:22.887
But you and Ricky, you're
going to be all right.

19:24.790 --> 19:28.392
We all have to calm down

19:28.459 --> 19:30.394
and just be there for you.

19:30.461 --> 19:32.196
Support you.

19:32.263 --> 19:34.799
I just wasn't thinking
clearly, I'm sorry.

19:34.866 --> 19:38.902
I was thinking about myself
and what Shakur and I wanted.

19:38.969 --> 19:41.571
We just got all caught
up in the excitement.

19:41.638 --> 19:44.473
But I totally understand
what you're saying.

19:46.010 --> 19:47.744
Thanks, Mom.

19:47.812 --> 19:51.280
You just cry as much as you want to.

19:51.348 --> 19:52.515
Oh. (CHUCKLES)

20:00.623 --> 20:01.924
Are you going to play next week?

20:01.991 --> 20:03.558
Phyllis is back next week.

20:03.626 --> 20:06.628
But I got 35 bucks if you
wanna see a movie or something.

20:10.933 --> 20:12.399
What?

20:12.467 --> 20:15.803
Hand me John's backpack. He
just got up and wants his bear.

20:15.871 --> 20:17.205
I think his bear is in there.

20:23.411 --> 20:24.812
You okay in here?

20:25.480 --> 20:26.713
Fine.

20:26.781 --> 20:28.281
Don't do anything stupid.

20:30.718 --> 20:32.986
Stupid like what? Idiot.

20:33.054 --> 20:34.921
Yeah. Idiot. (CHUCKLES)

20:34.989 --> 20:36.623
What does he think you're going
to do, kiss me or something?

20:36.690 --> 20:37.758
(BOTH CHUCKLE) Yeah.

20:45.206 --> 20:45.206
+

20:50.824 --> 20:54.260
Turn around. I'm not
going to talk to your back.

20:55.429 --> 20:57.029
That's more like it.

20:57.097 --> 20:59.766
I'm going out with Camille. We're
going to a movie. You want to go?

20:59.833 --> 21:02.167
Do I want to go hang out
with my dad and his date

21:02.235 --> 21:04.035
when I can't date? No, thank you.

21:04.103 --> 21:05.336
You got any homework?

21:05.405 --> 21:07.873
Yes, I do, but I don't
need your help with it,

21:07.940 --> 21:09.841
so don't let me keep you from your date.

21:09.909 --> 21:11.842
You can't seriously think that

21:11.911 --> 21:13.878
putting yourself into
the situation you got into

21:13.946 --> 21:15.880
with that girl would
have no consequences.

21:15.948 --> 21:18.082
But as it turns out,

21:18.150 --> 21:20.385
that situation did
not result in any harm

21:20.452 --> 21:25.156
other than my being, as she
put it, criminally neurotic.

21:25.224 --> 21:26.757
I blew it.

21:26.825 --> 21:29.426
I found a girl, a nice
girl who's a lot of fun,

21:29.493 --> 21:31.061
and I blew it.

21:31.129 --> 21:35.132
Yeah, you did. And she's not that
nice and she's way too much fun.

21:35.199 --> 21:37.467
Give yourself some
time to reflect on that

21:37.535 --> 21:40.404
and while you're reflecting,
focus on something else.

21:40.471 --> 21:42.739
Like what? Oh, I don't know.

21:42.807 --> 21:44.807
Like school? Like getting into college?

21:44.874 --> 21:47.609
School is easy and I'll get
into college, some college.

21:47.677 --> 21:50.712
Shouldn't we be looking
at colleges, you and I?

21:50.780 --> 21:53.182
You're not sticking around
here for school, are you?

21:53.250 --> 21:55.184
I might. Unless you and Camille

21:55.252 --> 21:57.886
would like to get me out of the
house so you can start over again.

21:57.955 --> 22:00.555
Ben, there's no starting over again.

22:00.622 --> 22:03.925
You're my son. You'll always be my son,

22:03.993 --> 22:08.163
but even after all you've been through
with Adrian and before that, Amy,

22:08.230 --> 22:10.999
you still seem incredibly
immature and irresponsible

22:11.067 --> 22:12.700
when it comes to relationships.

22:12.768 --> 22:14.336
Well, how am I going to
get better at relationships

22:14.403 --> 22:16.070
if I don't have any relationships?

22:16.137 --> 22:17.704
I let you see your two friends,

22:17.772 --> 22:19.440
start with those relationships.

22:19.507 --> 22:21.241
Come on, Dad. Please.

22:21.309 --> 22:23.310
Just let me see if I can't
talk Dylan into seeing me again.

22:23.378 --> 22:24.945
Let me see if she and
I can't start over.

22:25.013 --> 22:27.181
I just said there's no
starting over, all right?

22:27.248 --> 22:29.283
Life is a continuum.

22:29.351 --> 22:32.418
And I'd like one more shot
at continuing with Dylan.

22:32.486 --> 22:35.921
No, not as long as you're living
here and I'm supporting you, no.

22:35.990 --> 22:37.023
I'll see you later.

(BEN PLAYING)

22:45.132 --> 22:47.199
Hey, what are you up to?

22:51.604 --> 22:53.338
That's about a rat, you know.

22:53.406 --> 22:55.207
I just like the rat's name.

22:55.274 --> 22:57.509
It means something to me.

22:57.576 --> 23:00.578
I hope it means that you chose
the wrong first boyfriend,

23:00.646 --> 23:02.014
'cause he's a rat.

23:02.081 --> 23:03.747
And I mean that literally.

23:03.815 --> 23:07.318
He went to the DA's office
and he ratted you out.

23:07.386 --> 23:08.986
It's kind of sweet
when you think about it.

23:09.054 --> 23:10.854
No, it's not. It's kind of stupid.

23:10.922 --> 23:13.224
He thought we burned down the building.

23:13.291 --> 23:15.692
I thought you did, too,
but I didn't tell anyone.

23:15.760 --> 23:16.927
So?

23:16.995 --> 23:20.997
So, your dad should be
your hero not Ben the rat.

23:21.065 --> 23:24.267
You'd be my hero if you'd
let me go out with him again.

23:24.335 --> 23:26.536
Are you kidding?

23:26.603 --> 23:28.638
How can you want to
go out with that guy?

23:28.705 --> 23:31.674
He completes me.

23:31.742 --> 23:33.309
He does what?

23:33.377 --> 23:36.578
I'm kind of wild and crazy

23:36.646 --> 23:39.714
and he's kind of
level-headed and grounded.

23:39.782 --> 23:43.452
No, he's not. He's not
level-headed. Or grounded.

23:43.520 --> 23:45.654
He's not grounded in reality.

23:45.721 --> 23:48.323
He still has that school board
hearing coming up, you know?

23:48.391 --> 23:52.793
The one about him falsely accusing
a student teacher of being a pervert?

23:52.861 --> 23:54.529
The guy is a nut. He's not!

23:55.764 --> 23:57.498
He's just Ben, and...

23:57.566 --> 24:00.268
Don't say it, please don't say it.

24:00.335 --> 24:01.402
I love him.

24:01.470 --> 24:03.571
No, no, no, you don't love him

24:03.638 --> 24:06.040
and you two were not
meant to be together

24:06.108 --> 24:08.308
and you're not seeing him again.

24:08.376 --> 24:11.111
You know when you say that, it does
just make me want to see him again.

24:11.179 --> 24:14.647
Which is why I've laid down the law
and said you cannot see him again.

24:14.715 --> 24:16.516
I see him every day at school.

24:16.584 --> 24:19.186
This year. Next year,
he'll be away in college

24:19.253 --> 24:21.455
somewhere far, far away from here

24:21.522 --> 24:23.689
and you'll be back at your old school

24:23.756 --> 24:26.192
and you'll have some new boyfriend,

24:26.259 --> 24:27.526
a better boyfriend.

24:27.594 --> 24:29.628
I don't want a new boyfriend,

24:29.696 --> 24:31.897
a better boyfriend, I want Ben.

24:31.965 --> 24:33.399
I don't want Ben.

24:34.534 --> 24:36.502
Look, cookie,

24:36.570 --> 24:39.604
it's very important to me
that whoever you're with

24:39.671 --> 24:41.839
fits into this family.

24:41.907 --> 24:43.040
You're our only daughter.

24:44.110 --> 24:46.144
I know.

24:46.212 --> 24:47.945
And I'd hate to see you lose me.

24:49.815 --> 24:52.049
Don't say that.

24:52.118 --> 24:53.418
Please don't say that.

24:54.753 --> 24:56.820
Just one more chance.

Yeah. I will be.

25:09.167 --> 25:11.034
Seeing my dad with Kathleen at church

25:11.102 --> 25:14.703
was just one too many things,
really put me over the edge.

25:14.771 --> 25:16.172
I'm sorry.

25:16.240 --> 25:19.008
I am, too, but at least
you talked to my mom

25:19.075 --> 25:20.876
and it sounds as if we can get everyone

25:20.944 --> 25:22.778
to just go along with just
something simple and easy.

25:22.846 --> 25:25.080
We'll see.

All right, we got to go. Get
John, my dad wants to talk to me.

He said he'll meet us
back over at the apartment.

Does he still have the
extra key to the apartment?

25:32.321 --> 25:34.022
Yeah.

Oh, I understand.

Oh. Hey, Dad. What are you doing here?

26:49.045 --> 26:52.147
I thought maybe you'd come home after
church and visit with us for a while.

Your mother and I were
hoping you would, anyway.

26:54.683 --> 26:57.919

facing me right now.

27:18.572 --> 27:21.141
She called and asked if I
ever go to church anymore,

27:21.208 --> 27:22.509
and I said I'd been thinking about it

27:22.576 --> 27:25.345
and she said if I ever
went, could she have a ride.

27:25.413 --> 27:26.913
I gave her a ride.

27:26.980 --> 27:29.749
Without thinking what walking
her into church would do to Grace?

27:29.816 --> 27:32.451
No, I had put some
thought into it, I guess.

27:32.519 --> 27:35.187
I thought if I went walking
into church with Madison,

27:35.255 --> 27:38.424
Grace might reconsider being
in a real relationship with me.

27:38.491 --> 27:39.824
That's what I want.

27:39.892 --> 27:40.992
And you can get that from Madison?

27:41.061 --> 27:43.262
No, she isn't interested in sex, either.

27:43.329 --> 27:45.764
She just misses me. Not even me, really.

27:45.831 --> 27:49.600
She just misses having a boyfriend
to go places and do stuff with.

You think having sex makes
it a real relationship?

I know it doesn't,
Dad, but I'm almost 19.

27:55.273 --> 27:56.773
And I'm going to have sex.

27:56.840 --> 27:59.008
And it's not like I can't
get all the sex I want here.

27:59.077 --> 28:00.610
Then why don't you?

28:00.678 --> 28:02.812
Why don't you get out and
get all the sex you want here?

28:02.880 --> 28:04.781
Because I want to have sex with Grace.

28:04.848 --> 28:07.784
And having sex with the girls
here isn't going to get me that.

28:07.851 --> 28:09.886
But leading her to think you're
having sex with Madison might?

28:09.954 --> 28:12.020
All right, it was a
little passive-aggressive.

28:12.089 --> 28:13.989
But I don't know what to do.

28:14.057 --> 28:16.024
And I was in a bad mood because
we lost our first game, and...

28:16.093 --> 28:17.960
You're a man, Jack, a grown man.

28:18.027 --> 28:20.529
But maybe you still need your
dad to tell you what to do.

28:20.597 --> 28:22.931
You go see Grace and apologize to her

28:22.999 --> 28:25.334
and tell her how you feel
and ask her to see you again

28:25.402 --> 28:28.636
and back the hell off from
pressuring her to have sex.

28:28.704 --> 28:32.039
She will have sex with you if and
when she wants to have sex with you.

28:32.108 --> 28:34.875
But I suspect that's going to take
a serious commitment on your part.

28:34.943 --> 28:37.212
And if you don't think you can
make that serious commitment,

28:37.279 --> 28:40.181
don't even think about
having sex with her.

28:40.249 --> 28:42.350
You're getting too old for this game.

love with way back in the tenth grade,

to put up with any more

28:51.759 --> 28:53.360

supposed to be this week,

get back to us next week.

you, you get an attorney.

go there. I don't go there.

Well, next week bring your
friends, come to my church.

30:25.798 --> 30:28.766

you take coming to your church

as some sort of commitment
to keep coming to your church

31:47.475 --> 31:49.342
that you would go down
there to the DA's office

31:49.410 --> 31:52.012
and make her out to be
a criminal like that.

31:52.080 --> 31:53.346
How crazy are you?

31:53.414 --> 31:56.049
Pretty crazy, but
you've got to believe me,

31:56.117 --> 31:57.884
I just did what I thought was right.

31:57.952 --> 31:59.819
I just wanted to take responsibility

31:59.887 --> 32:02.155
and accept whatever
punishment was coming my way

32:02.223 --> 32:03.523
and just get it over with.

32:03.591 --> 32:05.592
Even if you didn't do anything?

32:05.659 --> 32:07.561
I didn't know that
we didn't do anything.

32:07.628 --> 32:10.862
And Dylan is under 18. I'm not.

32:10.930 --> 32:13.265
<i>I couldn't live with the
thought of going to prison.</i>

32:13.333 --> 32:15.434
I'm torn, you know.

32:15.502 --> 32:17.470
I want my daughter to be happy,

32:17.537 --> 32:20.005
but I also want her to be with
a guy who's reasonably sane.

32:20.073 --> 32:22.241
Who are you talking to? Grandma?

32:22.309 --> 32:24.577
<i>I'm sane. I swear. Just...</i>

32:24.644 --> 32:27.079
<i>Give me a chance to
prove it to you. Please?</i>

32:27.146 --> 32:28.714
Please give me just one more chance?

32:30.717 --> 32:32.751
Did you want to talk to Ben?

32:32.819 --> 32:35.186
That's Ben? Give me the phone!

32:35.254 --> 32:36.688
Not a word of this to your father.

32:36.756 --> 32:38.289
Okay, okay. Thanks.

32:39.258 --> 32:40.926
Ben?

32:40.994 --> 32:43.293
Ben, I've been thinking
about you all day.

32:43.361 --> 32:45.596
<i>This is all my fault.</i>

32:45.664 --> 32:47.498
<i>This is totally my fault.</i>

32:47.565 --> 32:50.501
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

32:50.568 --> 32:52.670
Me too, Dylan,

32:52.738 --> 32:54.839
I don't know how I screwed
things up with such a nice girl.

32:54.906 --> 32:56.907
Such a nice, fun girl.

32:56.975 --> 32:59.575
I do like to have fun.

32:59.644 --> 33:02.411
But I'm never going to do anything
fun that gets you into trouble again.

33:02.479 --> 33:04.413
I'm a big boy. I know how to say no.

33:04.481 --> 33:06.082
We have to figure out
how to see each other.

33:06.150 --> 33:09.452
We need to get your dad and my
dad to let us see each other.

33:09.520 --> 33:12.689
<i>Actually, I was thinking maybe...</i>

33:12.757 --> 33:15.024
This is a really crazy idea.

33:15.091 --> 33:17.960
I could pretend to be dating Henry.

33:18.028 --> 33:20.328
He could drop me off and pick me up

33:20.396 --> 33:22.430
and in between, I could be with you.

33:23.967 --> 33:25.467
Huh. That's brilliant.

33:25.535 --> 33:27.002
Thanks.

33:27.070 --> 33:28.971
I'll see you at school
tomorrow and we'll work it out?

33:29.039 --> 33:31.572
Thanks, Ben. I miss you.

33:31.640 --> 33:33.340
I miss you. (KNOCKING ON DOOR)

33:34.877 --> 33:36.978
I have to go. Tomorrow.

33:37.046 --> 33:38.512
Tomorrow.

33:44.586 --> 33:46.187
(BEN PLAYING)

33:52.727 --> 33:54.260
Do what?

33:54.328 --> 33:55.929
I'd do that. I owe you.

33:55.997 --> 33:57.263
Really, you don't mind?

33:57.331 --> 33:58.799
I mean, Dylan's parents aren't stupid.

33:58.866 --> 34:01.101
Okay, if Henry is going out with Dylan,

34:01.169 --> 34:02.669
who are you going to be
pretending to go out with?

34:03.904 --> 34:04.937
You?

34:07.468 --> 34:07.468
+

34:10.126 --> 34:12.495
- Dad?
- George?

34:12.562 --> 34:13.696
Grandpa!

34:23.237 --> 34:24.505
AMY: Dad?

34:24.572 --> 34:26.040
RICKY: George? Grandpa!

34:38.018 --> 34:39.985
Okay, we're both responsible
for that, not just me.

34:40.054 --> 34:41.688
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

34:41.755 --> 34:43.657
Hey, guys, I tried to catch you.

34:43.725 --> 34:44.991
I was parked around the corner,

34:45.059 --> 34:46.360
just waiting for you to get home.

34:46.428 --> 34:48.261
You have keys.

34:48.330 --> 34:49.797
Keys? No, I don't.

34:49.864 --> 34:51.164
Yeah. You have our extra keys.

34:51.232 --> 34:52.831
Oh, that's right. I forgot.

34:54.335 --> 34:55.601
How was lunch?

34:57.270 --> 34:59.071
Lunch was

35:00.507 --> 35:02.074
good. (CHUCKLES)

35:02.142 --> 35:04.811
Margaret and Shakur
are really good cooks.

35:04.878 --> 35:06.078
So am I, you know.

35:06.146 --> 35:07.714
Yeah, I know. But when was the last time

35:07.781 --> 35:10.415
we had dinner or lunch
or ate a meal together?

35:10.483 --> 35:12.283
You've been too busy with Kathleen.

35:12.352 --> 35:14.586
Not that I haven't been busy, too.

35:14.654 --> 35:17.356
John and I have some things
to do in the other room.

35:23.295 --> 35:24.962
Amy, I'm sorry.

35:25.029 --> 35:26.430
I didn't know you were coming to church

35:26.498 --> 35:28.566
and enen I saw the look on
your face, it nearly killed me.

35:28.633 --> 35:30.534
I hate disappointing you.

35:30.602 --> 35:32.936
But it happens.

35:33.004 --> 35:34.839
Parents disappoint
their children sometimes

35:34.906 --> 35:37.941
and children disappoint
their parents sometimes.

35:38.009 --> 35:41.043
Maybe we both expect
too much of each other.

35:41.111 --> 35:42.579
Wait. What are you getting at?

35:42.646 --> 35:43.813
I'm getting at...

35:45.816 --> 35:47.517
I think your mother is disappointed

35:47.585 --> 35:50.152
that you ran off and got
married and that's my fault.

35:50.220 --> 35:52.589
And I'm asking you to let her
arrange some kind of wedding

35:52.656 --> 35:54.323
so she can get what she wants,

35:54.392 --> 35:56.359
her and Margaret and Nora.

35:56.426 --> 35:58.159
I just wanted to see you married.

35:58.227 --> 36:01.730
I don't think I had to actually seeouou
say "I do" or anything like that.

36:01.798 --> 36:03.465
Or I thought I didn't,

36:03.533 --> 36:05.634
but maybe they need that, the women.

36:05.702 --> 36:08.370
So, you think you could think about
doing that? Maybe some time real soon?

36:08.438 --> 36:10.773
Well, I don't know about
some time real soon,

36:10.840 --> 36:13.340
but I could think about that.
We are thinking about that.

36:13.409 --> 36:15.175
I just told Margaret today that

36:15.243 --> 36:17.978
we didn't want to say yes
to her and no to my mom,

36:18.046 --> 36:19.614
and yes to my mom and no to her,

36:19.681 --> 36:21.783
so she said we'd all get
together to figure something out

36:21.850 --> 36:24.919
and we'll include Nora,
too. And you, if you want.

36:24.986 --> 36:27.789
You and... You, if you want.

36:29.056 --> 36:31.425
Thank you, Amy. I really appreciate it.

36:31.492 --> 36:35.361
And, uh, I feel kind of stupid
about this whole Kathleen thing.

36:35.430 --> 36:37.798
I've been over there like I'm the
new dad or something and I'm not.

36:37.865 --> 36:40.300
I'm not married to Kathleen

36:40.367 --> 36:42.869
and Grace and Tom are
pretty much adults.

36:42.937 --> 36:44.904
But I do hope that things will
work out for Kathleen and me

36:44.971 --> 36:46.539
and I hope you'll be okay with that.

36:46.606 --> 36:49.608
Yeah, I'm sure I will be. At some point.

36:49.676 --> 36:52.478
If it'll speed things up, I could agree
to just not take Kathleen to the wedding

36:52.546 --> 36:53.913
and your mom could
agree not to take a date

36:53.980 --> 36:55.347
so it will be just, you know,

36:55.415 --> 36:57.382
your mom and me and not Ashley.

36:57.451 --> 36:59.618
That'd be perfect, huh?

36:59.686 --> 37:01.786
No, not really.

37:01.854 --> 37:04.889
That would be peecectly selfish.

37:04.957 --> 37:06.925
I really need to grow up here.

37:06.992 --> 37:08.993
My son is going to be
three years old this year

37:09.061 --> 37:11.128
and I'm still acting
like a three-year-old.

37:11.196 --> 37:12.764
You and Mom should do whatever you want.

37:12.832 --> 37:13.898
She should bring a date if
she wants to bring a date

37:13.966 --> 37:15.433
and you should bring Kathleen.

37:15.501 --> 37:18.502
Even if that means bringing
along Grace and Tom.

37:18.570 --> 37:20.136
Because I just got married

37:20.204 --> 37:22.138
and getting married
means being in a family

37:22.206 --> 37:24.407
and our family seems to be
getting bigger and bigger

37:24.476 --> 37:26.242
and I just need to accept that.

37:26.310 --> 37:27.945
Did you?

37:28.012 --> 37:29.513
Did you just get married?

37:29.581 --> 37:30.647
What?

37:30.715 --> 37:32.815
What are you talking
about? Of course we did.

37:34.217 --> 37:35.551
(SIGHS)

37:37.320 --> 37:39.388
I don't know why I asked that.

37:39.456 --> 37:42.057
I guess it's just hitting
me that you're married.

37:42.125 --> 37:43.559
There's been so much
talk about a wedding,

37:43.627 --> 37:45.094
I keep forgetting
there's been a wedding.

37:46.329 --> 37:48.197
Yeah. But we're okay
with another one with

37:48.264 --> 37:51.132
our family and friends, as long
as it's small, nothing too big.

37:51.200 --> 37:52.667
So, are you going to say your vows again

37:52.735 --> 37:54.803
or is it just a reception or something?

37:54.871 --> 37:57.171
'Cause I think I'd kind of
like to hear you say "I do."

37:57.239 --> 37:59.007
And "I do."

37:59.074 --> 38:00.575
Just for the mothers. But that
would really be my only request.

38:00.643 --> 38:02.143
Other than that, I'll just show up.

38:02.211 --> 38:03.979
Yeah, okay, if that's okay with Amy.

38:04.046 --> 38:05.579
We'll say the vows again.

38:05.647 --> 38:08.248
Yeah, sure. It's okay.

38:08.316 --> 38:10.183
Okay, well...

38:10.251 --> 38:11.919
Sorry about this morning, kiddo.

38:11.987 --> 38:14.321
Yeah, thanks, Dad.

38:14.389 --> 38:17.658
All right, I'll see you. Maybe
we can all get together sometime.

38:17.726 --> 38:19.426
Yeah, maybe. Sometime.

38:19.494 --> 38:20.427
Text me.

38:20.495 --> 38:22.028
Okay.

38:25.900 --> 38:27.466
What's up with him?

38:27.535 --> 38:28.902
I'm not sure.

38:28.969 --> 38:31.971
You don't think he came and left?

38:32.039 --> 38:33.673
You don't think he saw that video?

38:33.741 --> 38:36.542
No. I don't think he's that
clever. He's still my dad.

38:36.609 --> 38:37.876
Are you all right?

38:37.944 --> 38:40.579
Yeah. I'm all right.

38:40.647 --> 38:42.180
I love you. You know that, right?

38:42.248 --> 38:43.381
Right.

38:48.788 --> 38:49.788
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

38:52.425 --> 38:53.724
Hi. Oh, hi, Jack.

38:53.792 --> 38:55.960
I just put all the food
away in the refrigerator.

38:56.028 --> 38:57.828
I actually made a big lunch for everyone

38:57.896 --> 39:00.397
in case you came home
from church with Grace.

39:00.465 --> 39:01.566
I messed that up.

39:01.633 --> 39:02.833
Yeah.

39:02.901 --> 39:04.134
Well, she's out in the guest house.

39:04.202 --> 39:06.971
I wanted to talk to you
before I talk to Grace.

39:07.039 --> 39:08.138
Why's that?

39:08.206 --> 39:11.741
I think I might want to
ask Grace to marry me.

39:11.809 --> 39:15.579
No. If you're asking for my permission,

39:15.646 --> 39:17.013
no, you don't have my permission.

39:17.081 --> 39:18.882
She's too young and you're too crazy.

39:18.950 --> 39:20.316
To even get engaged?

39:20.384 --> 39:22.919
Yeah. To even get engaged.

39:22.987 --> 39:25.621
I don't want Grace thinking she
has to get engaged or be married

39:25.689 --> 39:27.389
to feel okay about having sex with you.

39:27.457 --> 39:31.660
And I don't want her using church
or religion to say no to you.

39:31.728 --> 39:34.396
I want Grace to grow up
and I want you to grow up.

39:34.464 --> 39:37.132
You've both been bouncing
back and forth for years now

39:37.200 --> 39:39.534
and I don't think you've spent
enough time together to decide

39:39.603 --> 39:41.669
if you should be together
the rest of your lives.

39:42.370 --> 39:44.739
And as far as...

39:44.807 --> 39:47.208
I think that if you and
Grace want to have sex,

39:47.275 --> 39:49.110
then that's up to you and Grace.

39:49.177 --> 39:50.778
But I expect you to use condoms,

39:50.846 --> 39:52.546
I expect Grace to go back on the pill,

39:52.615 --> 39:55.984
and I expect you to not make
that decision too quickly,

39:56.051 --> 39:58.518
because I don't want you guys to
be together because the sex is good.

39:58.586 --> 40:00.654
I want you to be together
because you love each other.

40:00.722 --> 40:02.188
I'm sorry, my head is spinning.

40:02.256 --> 40:05.025
Grace doesn't want to
have sex with you right now

40:05.093 --> 40:07.227
and I don't want you to lure her
into that kind of relationship

40:07.294 --> 40:09.630
by telling her that
you want to marry her.

40:09.697 --> 40:11.965
I want you to just take your time,

40:12.033 --> 40:15.567
get to know each other
without having sex

40:15.636 --> 40:17.369
and then when and if the time is right,

40:17.437 --> 40:18.871
then do whatever you both want to do

40:18.939 --> 40:22.041
and whatever you both think is right.

40:22.109 --> 40:23.109
Okay?

40:23.176 --> 40:25.444
It all sounds so easy.

40:25.512 --> 40:27.312
Yeah. But it never is.

40:27.380 --> 40:28.580
(TELEPHONE RINGING)

40:31.017 --> 40:32.651
Excuse me, I need to take this.

40:35.021 --> 40:36.220
Hi.

40:36.288 --> 40:38.023
GEORGE: Can I come over? Of course.

40:45.964 --> 40:48.398
(SIGHS)

40:48.466 --> 40:51.101
Whatever it is, everything
is going to be fine.

40:55.606 --> 40:57.641
Am I supposed to go now?

40:57.709 --> 41:00.310
Could you, Tom? I need to talk to Grace.

41:00.378 --> 41:02.344
Do whatever you want, Tom.
I'm not talking to him.

41:02.412 --> 41:03.680
I'm out.

41:07.818 --> 41:09.886
How could you?

41:09.953 --> 41:12.989
I was trying to make
you as crazy as I am.

41:13.057 --> 41:14.590
What?

41:14.658 --> 41:15.858
I can't stand the thought of
you having another guy around.

41:15.926 --> 41:17.659
Not again, I can't.

41:17.727 --> 41:19.360
And I can't pretend like
I don't care. Because I do.

41:19.428 --> 41:21.129
And yes, I want to sleep with you

41:21.197 --> 41:22.630
but yes, I won't ask again.

41:22.699 --> 41:24.799
Meaning? I'm all yours
if you'll have me.

41:24.866 --> 41:27.267
And I love you enough
to do whatever you want,

41:27.335 --> 41:29.704
or not do whatever you don't want.

41:32.340 --> 41:33.808
Thank you, God.

41:38.046 --> 41:40.614
I got to go. Shakur's waiting on me.

41:40.682 --> 41:43.850
All right. I just wanted to
show you my grandmother's car.

41:43.918 --> 41:45.318
It's cool, huh?

41:45.385 --> 41:47.320
Yeah.

41:47.387 --> 41:48.822
And you're cool, too.

41:53.227 --> 41:56.495
Okay, are you going to kiss me or not?

41:58.297 --> 41:59.464
Or not.

42:02.068 --> 42:03.936
All right, fine.

42:11.978 --> 42:13.111
(CHUCKLES)

42:14.947 --> 42:17.882
Oh. No, it was nice.

42:17.950 --> 42:20.885
It made me laugh
because it made me happy.

42:20.953 --> 42:22.353
Not funny happy?

42:22.420 --> 42:23.755
Happy happy.

42:25.858 --> 42:29.626
God. Her, too. She kicked me.

42:29.693 --> 42:31.661
Do you want to feel?

42:31.729 --> 42:33.130
Uh, maybe some other time.

42:33.197 --> 42:35.766
I think the kiss was
enough for a first date.

42:36.968 --> 42:38.135
