09:47.110 --> 09:49.789
on my native American superstition, pops.

09:49.990 --> 09:51.274
Sorry.

09:53.117 --> 09:55.295
Hey, you've taken trophies
all over the world.

09:55.320 --> 09:56.752
I figured you'd be proud of me.

09:56.786 --> 09:59.922
The next time I'm proud of
you, Wick, it'll be the first.

10:00.375 --> 10:02.674
I wasn't proud when you quit college.

10:02.709 --> 10:05.294
I sure as hell ain't proud
that you're running around

10:05.296 --> 10:08.130
all over town scamming deals
that are never gonna play out,

10:08.181 --> 10:09.798
trashing the family name.

10:10.343 --> 10:13.435
You think I'm just gonna toss
you the keys to the kingdom

10:13.632 --> 10:15.504
and watch you drive it over the cliff?

10:15.538 --> 10:17.439
I'm taking a different tack with you.

10:18.070 --> 10:19.808
You're going to work on a rig.

10:20.257 --> 10:21.810
Duchess, here.

10:21.845 --> 10:24.112
So, the bitch got to you, huh?

10:30.262 --> 10:32.000
Keep talking about my wife.

10:37.697 --> 10:38.929
Uh-huh.

10:42.327 --> 10:44.328
You start pushing mud first thing.

10:48.755 --> 10:50.172
(Spits)

10:50.223 --> 10:51.890
(Indistinct conversations)

10:51.924 --> 10:53.175
Come on!

10:53.226 --> 10:55.093
Sorry, boys. All the roustabout
gigs are gone, all right?

10:55.144 --> 10:56.345
(Men groan)

10:56.396 --> 10:57.516
Aw, hey, man. Listen, listen.

10:57.563 --> 10:59.598
I need a job that pays cash today. Please.

10:59.649 --> 11:02.017
All right. You can push
mud. It pays 100 bucks per.

11:02.019 --> 11:04.519
Whoa. A lot of guys can't
last half-day doing that.

11:04.521 --> 11:05.854
Yeah, well, how hard can it be, right?

11:05.905 --> 11:06.938
(Laughter)

11:06.989 --> 11:09.157
Come back tomorrow, you tell us.

11:09.192 --> 11:11.526
Jules: I retrofitted each
unit with a kitchenette,

11:11.528 --> 11:13.361
so it's really more like an apartment.

11:13.412 --> 11:15.197
Don't you work at the Tack Room Bar?

11:15.199 --> 11:17.249
I own it.

11:17.283 --> 11:19.918
Around here, you've either
got two jobs or two houses.

11:19.952 --> 11:22.170
Yeah, well, right now we don't have either.

11:25.675 --> 11:26.675
(Sighs)

11:26.676 --> 11:28.210
I promise you, with the demand up here,

11:28.261 --> 11:29.523
this place won't last the week.

11:29.962 --> 11:31.880
Somebody stole the frame on that one.

11:31.882 --> 11:33.359
Sleeps just fine.

11:34.171 --> 11:35.515
How much is it?

11:35.540 --> 11:37.671
$2,000 a month. Firm.

11:40.056 --> 11:41.312
I'm feeling sick.

11:42.525 --> 11:44.893
That's what everyone says when
they hear the prices up here.

11:44.895 --> 11:46.361
(Airplane engine whirs)

11:46.395 --> 11:48.313
(Dogs barking)

11:49.615 --> 11:51.640
Hap: Ben, you want to grab them?

11:54.403 --> 11:55.620
Go on.

11:55.654 --> 11:57.038
Well.
- I missed you.

11:57.073 --> 11:57.822
(Chuckles)

11:57.873 --> 11:58.873
Mm.

11:58.908 --> 12:00.375
I missed you, baby.

12:02.084 --> 12:04.753
You remember that, uh,
weaselly V.P. From Goldman?

12:04.797 --> 12:06.748
Isn't that every V.P. At Goldman?

12:06.782 --> 12:08.183
You mean Singer.

12:08.765 --> 12:12.587
He mentioned a bombshell
coming out of U.S. Geological.

12:12.638 --> 12:16.641
Since when do New York bankers
have patch intel we don't?

12:16.675 --> 12:20.011
Since they got new
thermal mapping technology.

12:20.062 --> 12:21.968
Singer acted like I already knew about it,

12:21.993 --> 12:25.099
so I stove-piped him and he kept going.

12:25.429 --> 12:28.436
We got to get that report, Hap.

12:28.438 --> 12:30.521
Before it comes out.

12:30.573 --> 12:32.573
Well, I'm betting you already invited

12:32.608 --> 12:34.442
our old buddy the oil commissioner

12:34.493 --> 12:36.110
to our party, now didn't you?

12:36.161 --> 12:37.945
He's seated right between us.

12:39.448 --> 12:41.916
I knew there was a reason I married you.

12:42.953 --> 12:43.701
(Thunder crashes)

12:43.726 --> 12:45.703
- Come on, man. Keep it moving.
- Right there!

12:45.754 --> 12:47.755
- Hold that thing down.
- Get it going. Get it going!

12:47.790 --> 12:49.340
Slow down, son.

12:49.374 --> 12:52.164
They're not paying you by the shovelful.

12:53.761 --> 12:57.296
Last time I saw you, you were
in a bit of a situation, huh?

12:58.467 --> 12:59.967
Yeah, I wasn't worried.

13:00.883 --> 13:02.811
What were the Mandan Indians gonna do, huh?

13:02.855 --> 13:04.555
Nothing.

13:04.606 --> 13:06.328
Your last name's Briggs, yeah?

13:07.523 --> 13:09.277
Too bad you're not Hap's son.

13:09.311 --> 13:10.895
Yeah, that's too bad.

13:13.899 --> 13:16.033
The baron of the Bakken's your old man?

13:16.068 --> 13:18.486
(Indistinct shouting)

13:18.488 --> 13:20.655
I've read all the stories.

13:20.706 --> 13:22.323
Dirt farmer's son.

13:22.325 --> 13:23.658
Wildcatter.

13:23.709 --> 13:25.459
Man's a legend.

13:26.661 --> 13:28.710
Yeah, only if you don't know him.

13:30.048 --> 13:31.966
What are you doing out here with the fish?

13:32.000 --> 13:34.502
What'd the bastard say?

13:34.867 --> 13:36.637
Oh, yeah.

13:36.671 --> 13:39.473
"Learn the business from the muck up."

13:39.508 --> 13:41.509
What the hell does he know, anyway?

13:41.560 --> 13:43.811
I could blast through this shale faster

13:43.845 --> 13:45.646
than any tool pusher he's got.

13:45.680 --> 13:47.398
Waste of my damn time.

13:47.432 --> 13:50.684
(Indistinct shouting)

13:52.354 --> 13:54.521
Irv: Mrs. Carlson, I'm
gonna do your refill,

13:54.523 --> 13:56.190
but you got to follow these tags.

13:56.241 --> 13:58.025
You cannot drink alcohol with this.

13:58.027 --> 13:59.994
It's gonna be as long as it's gonna be.

14:00.028 --> 14:02.053
- My eczema's killing me.
- I am sorry.

14:02.078 --> 14:03.697
Doc, come on, put a rush on it.

14:03.748 --> 14:04.865
Okay, I'm not a doctor,

14:04.916 --> 14:06.500
and everything in here's
on a rush, all right?

14:06.534 --> 14:08.118
Oh, come on, man. Why
you got to be such a jerk?

14:08.169 --> 14:09.036
Uh, 'Scuse me, sir?

14:09.038 --> 14:10.204
What?

14:10.255 --> 14:12.623
Corticosteroid cream mixed with coconut oil

14:12.674 --> 14:13.924
will knock back eczema.

14:13.959 --> 14:16.126
What?

14:16.177 --> 14:17.511
All right. Coconut oil.

14:17.545 --> 14:19.763
Cortico's in five, coconut
oil's in the grocery store.

14:19.798 --> 14:20.798
Thank you, young lady.

14:20.849 --> 14:21.932
Sure. No problem.

14:21.983 --> 14:23.384
(Truck beeping)

14:23.418 --> 14:25.803
Man: There's got to be something in there!

14:28.306 --> 14:30.390
Hey, hey, hey! Whoa! Whoa!

14:30.419 --> 14:33.037
Stop! The wire! Stop!

14:33.062 --> 14:34.468
- What are you whining about man?
- [Bleep]

14:34.493 --> 14:36.053
You're gonna knock the whole thing down!

14:38.399 --> 14:41.401
(Wires warbling)

14:44.739 --> 14:46.623
- Whoa!
- Watch out!

14:46.658 --> 14:48.325
(Men yelling)

14:48.376 --> 14:51.295
♪

14:57.802 --> 14:59.136
Bloody hell! You could've killed us!

14:59.170 --> 15:00.504
What are you doing?! You were on the rocks!

15:00.555 --> 15:01.922
It's not on me! He was backing me in!

15:01.924 --> 15:03.423
I am not his spotter!

15:03.425 --> 15:05.809
You are fired!

15:05.843 --> 15:07.761
Go to the office and
turn in your credentials.

15:07.763 --> 15:09.763
Hey, cost me a job, slick.

15:09.814 --> 15:12.265
Pushing mud? Please.
I just did you a favor.

15:12.267 --> 15:16.103
Wick Briggs.

15:20.441 --> 15:22.242
I saw you back that truck in.

15:22.276 --> 15:23.694
Wha... (Laughs nervously)

15:23.745 --> 15:25.445
You weren't paying attention, boy.

15:26.664 --> 15:29.366
That's a million-dollar mistake.

15:29.417 --> 15:31.751
I had nothing to do with
it. It wasn't my fault.

15:31.786 --> 15:33.537
(Grunts)

15:35.623 --> 15:37.874
You're a lying son of a bitch.

15:42.046 --> 15:45.849
Get up, man. Stop acting
like a damn coward.

15:45.883 --> 15:49.185
(Men shouting)

15:50.972 --> 15:52.639
(Grunts)

15:54.859 --> 15:56.643
You are out, boy.

15:58.479 --> 16:00.647
No cards, no clubs, no cash.

16:02.533 --> 16:06.069
Are you hearing me? You're out!

16:07.488 --> 16:08.621
(Scoffs)

16:08.656 --> 16:11.958
You don't deserve to be my son.

16:11.992 --> 16:15.078
(Thunder rumbling)

16:20.992 --> 16:22.811
Hi. Wow.

16:23.516 --> 16:25.015
You look good.

16:26.187 --> 16:27.651
Is this... Is this ours?

16:27.685 --> 16:31.521
Yeah. Yeah, 1,000 bucks.

16:31.573 --> 16:33.357
Here.
- What are you doing?

16:33.408 --> 16:34.858
Robbing banks over here?

16:34.909 --> 16:36.109
Yes, I am.

16:36.160 --> 16:38.946
No. I got offered a job at
the pharmacy in town today.

16:38.997 --> 16:42.082
Mr. Youngerman advanced
me my first paycheck, so...

16:42.116 --> 16:44.785
But you dropped out of
pharmacy school after two years.

16:44.836 --> 16:47.254
Yeah, well, apparently
that's good enough up here.

16:47.288 --> 16:48.505
Mm.

16:48.539 --> 16:50.090
Said he'd take every waking
hour I could give him.

16:50.124 --> 16:52.125
- (Laughs)
- It's a foot in the door.

16:52.639 --> 16:53.639
Yeah, you like it?

16:53.664 --> 16:55.414
Christmas lights and everything.

16:55.465 --> 16:56.562
- Mm-hmm. -
Oh, that a girl.

16:56.587 --> 16:58.918
Look at Cody LeFever
marching down the field,

16:58.969 --> 16:59.969
throwing first downs.

17:00.003 --> 17:00.803
Yeah, that's me.

17:00.838 --> 17:02.004
(Chuckles)

17:02.055 --> 17:05.558
Well, um, I had a little setback today.

17:05.592 --> 17:06.601
What's that?

17:06.626 --> 17:08.792
I got fired.

17:10.180 --> 17:12.181
You got fired.

17:12.183 --> 17:13.482
Hey, yeah...

17:13.517 --> 17:16.018
How? It's your first d...

17:16.069 --> 17:18.020
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

17:18.021 --> 17:19.355
Listen. Listen to me.

17:19.406 --> 17:21.656
It's okay. It was just a job pushing mud.

17:21.692 --> 17:22.858
It's still a paycheck.

17:22.909 --> 17:24.076
This place is hopping.

17:24.111 --> 17:25.328
I'll find another one.

17:25.362 --> 17:26.444
I'll find something.

17:26.496 --> 17:27.530
Promise?

17:27.580 --> 17:29.062
(Sighs)

17:29.087 --> 17:30.386
Babe.

17:30.411 --> 17:33.080
I'm sorry.

17:33.420 --> 17:35.538
I haven't felt this bad in a while.

17:35.589 --> 17:37.706
Must've caught a bug or something.

17:37.708 --> 17:40.126
Hey, you look at me.

17:40.177 --> 17:41.427
(Sighs)

17:41.461 --> 17:45.264
I'll do anything to take
care of you, you know that.

17:45.298 --> 17:47.266
Promise.

17:48.312 --> 17:50.343
A lot of promises.

17:50.597 --> 17:52.197
I know. But this one I really mean.

17:52.222 --> 17:53.889
You know, those other ones...

17:53.891 --> 17:55.558
(Laughs)

17:55.592 --> 17:59.028
(Soft music plays)

17:59.062 --> 18:01.981
Time to flush some Mormon
pheasant, don't you think?

18:02.032 --> 18:03.032
Give me the gun.

18:03.066 --> 18:05.046
(Chuckles) You don't need one, honey.

18:05.196 --> 18:07.695
Commissioner, Hap and I are
so glad you could join us.

18:07.720 --> 18:08.904
Thank you.

18:08.955 --> 18:10.205
Happy birthday to you, Hap.

18:10.240 --> 18:11.240
Well, thanks, Myron.

18:11.291 --> 18:12.971
- So happy you could be here.
- Thank you.

18:12.996 --> 18:15.312
I'll be with you two in
just a minute, all right?

18:15.795 --> 18:18.247
I hear Salt Lake's putting a squeeze on you

18:18.249 --> 18:19.875
to get a temple built in Rock Springs.

18:19.915 --> 18:22.601
Oh, I'm, uh... I'm squeeze-proof, Carla.

18:22.836 --> 18:23.669
(Chuckles)

18:23.720 --> 18:24.887
Of course you are.

18:24.921 --> 18:27.089
But I guess you've heard the rumor

18:27.140 --> 18:29.695
that our dear governor's been
hiking the Appalachian Trail.

18:29.720 --> 18:30.609
I have.

18:30.634 --> 18:34.289
And when that rumor goes public,
there's gonna be a recall.

18:34.848 --> 18:38.684
Then I shall, uh, pray
for spiritual guidance.

18:38.735 --> 18:39.902
(Chuckles)

18:39.936 --> 18:42.265
You don't need spiritual guidance, Myron.

18:42.290 --> 18:43.290
You've got me.

18:43.543 --> 18:45.375
A smart oil and gas commissioner

18:45.400 --> 18:46.701
with the right backers

18:46.726 --> 18:49.277
could be sleeping in
the governor's mansion.

18:49.302 --> 18:50.519
And that temple,

18:50.904 --> 18:54.240
well, the governor gets to
approve whatever he wants.

18:58.955 --> 19:00.956
(Sighs)

19:00.958 --> 19:02.758
You're a little crooked.

19:07.398 --> 19:08.899
Hap, this is unbelievable.

19:08.924 --> 19:11.309
According to Myron's
report, the richest areas

19:11.334 --> 19:14.140
of the Bakken shale are on
land previously thought barren.

19:14.895 --> 19:17.062
That's the four bears Indian reservation.

19:17.087 --> 19:19.972
Those plots been drilled
harder than a Tulsa whore.

19:19.997 --> 19:22.916
The old Wells didn't go deep enough.

19:22.941 --> 19:26.976
The Bakken reserves are at least
10 times previous estimates.

19:28.018 --> 19:30.522
Bigger than the Saudi Ghawar field.

19:32.251 --> 19:33.467
Come on.

19:33.492 --> 19:34.642
Yes.

19:34.667 --> 19:36.318
Hey, now!

19:36.343 --> 19:38.110
(Laughs)

19:38.135 --> 19:41.170
Well... Except...

19:41.195 --> 19:45.198
Tribe is gonna be pissed because
Wick shot that damn moose.
