00:32.198 --> 00:35.793
Excuse me. Oi! Whoa.
Excuse me! Whoa, whoa, whoa!

00:35.868 --> 00:38.792
Can you remove your hat
and earphones, please?

00:38.871 --> 00:41.169
Remove the hat and the earphones.

00:41.249 --> 00:44.093
Have you got some sort
of form of ID, please?

00:45.545 --> 00:47.218
ID?

00:47.296 --> 00:49.264
- It's in my bag.
- Sorry?

00:49.340 --> 00:52.469
- It's in my bag, officer.
- Remove your bag. Give me it.

00:52.552 --> 00:55.806
- My colleague will search it.
- Anything in it that'll hurt me?

00:55.888 --> 00:58.687
Any sharps? Anything you shouldn't have?
Illegal substances?

00:58.766 --> 01:01.610
- Where were you coming from?
- I don't have to answer that.

01:01.686 --> 01:05.281
- Where are you heading to now?
- I don't have to answer that.

01:05.355 --> 01:08.986
We have reports of someone matching
your description acting suspiciously...

01:09.068 --> 01:12.789
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. What's going on here?
- Step over here, gentlemen?

01:12.863 --> 01:15.491
No taking photographs or filming.
D'you mind?

01:15.575 --> 01:18.328
My colleague's gonna search you.
Do you understand?

01:18.411 --> 01:21.631
Step over here, please.
Excuse me, step over here.

01:21.706 --> 01:25.006
- Mohammed, are you alright there?
- Stand there. Stand there.

01:25.084 --> 01:26.552
Gonna pat you down, alright?

01:26.627 --> 01:29.597
- Control.
- You've got nothing in here, have you?

01:29.672 --> 01:32.300
A Mohammed Anrawi.

01:32.383 --> 01:34.135
An-ra-wi.

01:34.218 --> 01:36.687
Take your shoes off.

01:36.762 --> 01:40.858
- Shoes and socks, officer.
- Oi, tell him. What's going on?

01:40.933 --> 01:43.903
"Do you understand that?"

01:43.978 --> 01:48.779
Patrol. Wilson, forget it.
He's fucking job.

01:48.858 --> 01:50.656
- What?
- He's a fucking copper.

01:50.735 --> 01:53.158
- Why didn't you tell us?
- Get in the car.

01:53.237 --> 01:55.990
For fuck's sake. Wasting my fucking time.

01:56.073 --> 01:57.666
See you back at the nick, yeah.

01:57.742 --> 02:00.086
You not riding with your boys,
PC Mohammed?

02:00.161 --> 02:01.788
Police training officer.

02:01.871 --> 02:04.750
This is why pigs are forbidden, brother.

02:04.832 --> 02:06.960
D'you get that one? We don't do bacon.

02:21.140 --> 02:23.768
Alright, boys? Alright? How's your missus?

02:23.851 --> 02:27.355
- Early night for him.
- You still got it cracked?

02:27.438 --> 02:30.783
How are the boys, alright?
How's it going, mate?

02:30.858 --> 02:33.327
Alright, I'm alright.

02:38.783 --> 02:41.912
Violence has returned
to the streets of Shadwell.

02:41.994 --> 02:45.123
Reports of gang violence and
street crime to Shadwell Town FC

02:45.206 --> 02:50.178
are sparking concerns that the historic
reputation of the club's followers...

02:50.252 --> 02:54.382
- No one likes the Shadwell Army!
- No one likes the Shadwell Army!

02:54.465 --> 02:56.467
No one likes the Shadwell Army!

02:56.550 --> 03:00.100
No one likes the Shadwell Army!

03:00.179 --> 03:03.058
What is freedom? They pollute us.

03:03.140 --> 03:05.108
They poison us.

03:05.184 --> 03:08.438
Side-by-side with this country's freedom

03:08.521 --> 03:10.398
we must carry our faith.

03:18.114 --> 03:22.620
We are the Shadwell,
the Kennel is our place!

03:23.035 --> 03:27.336
Shadwell never, ever, ever
shall lose face!

03:31.627 --> 03:34.176
Two Muslims walk into Heaven.

03:34.255 --> 03:36.553
Place is teeming with wall-to-wall
crumpet.

03:36.632 --> 03:39.886
All dancing along to the beat
of the call to prayer.

03:39.969 --> 03:41.391
All wearing burkas.

03:41.470 --> 03:44.690
Mohammed turns to Mohammed,
he says, "This is alright, mate".

03:44.765 --> 03:47.689
Mohammed turns back, he says,
"I don't fancy your 70 much".

03:47.768 --> 03:49.896
Used that one last week.

03:49.979 --> 03:54.109
I mean, be honest, what man 'ere,
if offered an eternity of bliss

03:54.191 --> 03:57.616
with 70 of Heaven's most beautiful virgins

03:57.695 --> 04:00.574
in return for jamming a stick of Semtex
up your jacksy,

04:00.656 --> 04:02.078
well, who wouldn't have that, eh? I would.

04:02.158 --> 04:04.536
I've got a stiffy the size of Big Ben 'ere.

04:04.618 --> 04:05.744
In your dreams.

04:05.828 --> 04:08.752
See the new mosque
got its planning permission then.

04:08.831 --> 04:10.708
And where are they sticking that?

04:10.791 --> 04:14.216
Only slap fucking bang
next to Shadwell's football ground.

04:14.295 --> 04:16.889
- Fucking shame!
- What's that all about, eh?

04:16.964 --> 04:21.685
Ain't a new mosque we need. What we need
is a new stadium for our football team.

04:21.761 --> 04:23.559
Any dogs here?

04:23.637 --> 04:27.767
I mean it's all very well selling out
to a dodgy Russian billionaire,

04:27.850 --> 04:31.104
but can anyone 'ere tell me
what the fuck is the Europa Cup

04:31.187 --> 04:34.817
- and how did we qualify for it?
- Look at your jug ears, pal.

04:34.899 --> 04:38.244
You're funny!
I tell you how we qualified for it,

04:38.319 --> 04:40.947
because we come top
of the "Fair Play League".

04:41.030 --> 04:44.284
I mean "fair play"?
That's not what Shadwell's about, is it?

04:44.366 --> 04:48.087
Their supporters are from the poorest,
most deprived part of the capital.

04:48.162 --> 04:52.008
For them, their team is their religion
and they are feared throughout the land.

04:52.082 --> 04:53.129
Yeah.

04:53.209 --> 04:56.804
The question is, my friends, does
Vukovitch really know what he's bought?

04:56.879 --> 04:58.381
I mean Shadwell.

04:58.464 --> 05:03.391
We think catenaccio is a frothy coffee,
not a deep-lying Italian-style defence.

05:03.469 --> 05:06.393
Get off, Eddie.

05:06.472 --> 05:08.816
My name's Eddie. Be glad yours isn't.

05:08.891 --> 05:10.985
I thank you.

05:11.977 --> 05:15.481
- What does he normally drink after a set?
- Usually a bottle of white wine.

05:15.564 --> 05:18.488
OK, a bottle of your best
and an orange juice please, mate.

05:18.567 --> 05:20.740
- A glass of orange juice.
- Cheers.

05:20.820 --> 05:23.118
- Could you take it over?
- Yeah, no problem.

05:26.325 --> 05:28.748
For me?

05:28.828 --> 05:31.047
Not like you, Gerry. What's the catch?

05:36.460 --> 05:41.933
Know who that is? That's Gerry Edwards.
Used to play up front for Shadwell.

05:42.007 --> 05:45.602
Scored the goal that got us promotion
to the old First Division.

05:48.430 --> 05:51.684
Last time a copper bought me a drink
was my retirement do.

05:52.810 --> 05:54.608
How d'you know I was Old Bill?

05:54.687 --> 05:57.281
You're joking, right?

05:57.356 --> 05:59.450
My name's Mohammed.

05:59.525 --> 06:02.870
- Really?
- I've been put undercover at the dogs.

06:02.945 --> 06:04.743
Huh.

06:04.822 --> 06:07.826
An ethnic attached to the Shadwell firm?

06:07.908 --> 06:09.910
You're being set up, boy.

06:10.703 --> 06:14.173
So what made you join the Bill, then, eh?
Got cops in the family?

06:14.248 --> 06:16.922
No. Totally against it.

06:17.001 --> 06:19.003
Dad hasn't spoken to me since.

06:20.254 --> 06:22.382
- What's funny?
- You.

06:23.465 --> 06:26.389
You and Trevor Clymer
were on a crew together, right?

06:26.468 --> 06:29.392
Clever Trevor put you up for this, has he?

06:29.471 --> 06:32.190
Hated that fucker. He was a bottler.

06:33.475 --> 06:35.569
Our team was in bits after Shadwell.

06:36.896 --> 06:38.990
Especially John.

06:39.690 --> 06:43.820
Listen, the best advice I can give you,
and that's what you're here for, right?

06:43.903 --> 06:47.077
When you do bail out,
do it on your own terms.

06:47.156 --> 06:49.534
Get 'em to retire you on medical grounds.

06:49.617 --> 06:50.789
I won't be bailing out.

06:50.868 --> 06:54.543
Fucking hell, you are serious.
Listen, forget it, Mohammed.

06:54.622 --> 06:57.250
You're too straight.
You gotta be able to bend and swerve.

06:57.333 --> 07:00.462
- I can bend, I can swerve.
- I ain't doubting you got the nuts for it.

07:00.544 --> 07:03.388
But, Shadwell-wise,
you're totally fucking clueless.

07:03.464 --> 07:07.389
I'm not straight off the fucking boat.
I'm Shadwell, born and bred.

07:07.468 --> 07:09.562
Well, listen, grasshopper,

07:11.805 --> 07:13.899
first thing you're gonna have to do,

07:13.974 --> 07:16.773
the most important thing you're gonna do,

07:16.852 --> 07:20.072
if, if you're gonna
ride with the Shadwell,

07:22.566 --> 07:25.115
you're gonna have to have a drink,
ain't you?

07:26.153 --> 07:29.373
Gerry! Another glass over here, mate.

07:32.117 --> 07:34.540
Cheers.

07:34.620 --> 07:36.588
Now listen to me.

07:36.664 --> 07:41.340
You're gonna be offered E's, speed, skunk,
rocks and charlie.

07:41.418 --> 07:44.888
You'll be expected to chase
every bit of skirt you can get near to.

07:44.964 --> 07:49.014
You will be expected to use
the most obscene language imaginable

07:49.093 --> 07:52.643
to every race, religion and god there is.
Oh,

07:52.721 --> 07:54.815
and there will be violence,

07:54.890 --> 07:57.814
and you will be
expected to participate in it.

07:59.269 --> 08:01.192
Bottom line...

08:02.022 --> 08:04.275
You will drink like a dog.

08:04.358 --> 08:06.452
Fuck like a dog.

08:06.527 --> 08:07.995
And fight like a dog.

08:08.070 --> 08:11.745
So you'd better leave that holy book
at home, Mohammed,

08:11.824 --> 08:13.918
and have that drink.

08:19.039 --> 08:20.416
Huh.

08:20.499 --> 08:21.921
Don't think,

08:22.001 --> 08:24.095
do it!

08:36.557 --> 08:38.650
Good boy.

08:41.020 --> 08:43.239
Ain't a fighting man, though, are you?

08:43.897 --> 08:45.899
Should've slapped me back.

08:47.901 --> 08:49.995
Your round, I think, Mohammed.

08:54.408 --> 08:57.833
It's about getting
your face known, getting trusted.

08:57.911 --> 09:00.005
Try too hard, they'll suss you.

09:04.418 --> 09:07.763
Once you're part of the furniture,
trust me, they'll come to you.

09:07.838 --> 09:10.261
Just make sure
you're there to take advantage.

09:12.926 --> 09:15.725
One false step and they'll have you,
believe me.

09:15.804 --> 09:18.683
You'll be gone before you even started.

09:18.766 --> 09:22.487
So ease your way in.
Get your face known around the manor.

09:22.561 --> 09:24.780
Go on, I'll buy you a drink.
What you having?

09:24.855 --> 09:28.701
Ross, can I get these two
the cheapest drink you've got.

09:29.693 --> 09:33.038
Pick the young targets,
the ambitious ones. They're easier.

09:33.113 --> 09:36.868
Trust me,
they'll lead you to the top dogs.

09:36.950 --> 09:38.793
The ones with the big bites.

09:47.878 --> 09:51.178
- I'm just going for a fag.
- Yeah, yeah, see you in a minute.

09:58.097 --> 10:00.191
Got a light, mate?

10:10.150 --> 10:13.871
Just when you get comfortable,
you're in more danger than you know.

10:22.913 --> 10:25.007
I do wish I hadn't seen that.

10:25.958 --> 10:28.802
When you make a connection,
don't chase it.

10:28.877 --> 10:30.971
Back off.

10:34.716 --> 10:37.060
You'll wanna go for it. Hold back.

10:39.096 --> 10:42.316
Let days go by. Trust the connection.

10:48.689 --> 10:51.659
Alright, boys? How you doing? Alright?
Alright, mate.

10:53.569 --> 10:56.163
- Danny Boy.
- Gumbo!

10:57.614 --> 11:00.493
- The missus let you out, has she?
- Alright, Nicky boy?

11:00.576 --> 11:02.249
- Good to see ya.
- Who's winning?

11:02.327 --> 11:05.547
- I am, mate.
- Oh, for fuck's sake, Gumbo.

11:05.622 --> 11:09.297
For fuck's sake, go on. Go and get
the drinks in. Go on, fuck off.

11:09.376 --> 11:11.219
I'll have a bottle.

11:11.295 --> 11:13.389
Fuck's sake.

11:13.547 --> 11:17.393
- Don't mind him, mate, he's harmless.
- Is it okay if I get a game?

11:17.467 --> 11:20.971
Put your coin on the table,
same as everyone else.

11:21.847 --> 11:23.941
The winner stays on.

11:29.229 --> 11:31.323
Who's that?

11:32.691 --> 11:35.535
- Alright, boy, what you having?
- No, you're alright.

11:35.611 --> 11:38.490
I won't have it.
I'll stand my round. What d'you want?

11:38.572 --> 11:40.199
- Gumbo.
- Yeah?

11:40.282 --> 11:43.582
What have I told you
about talking to strangers?

11:43.660 --> 11:47.005
He's alright.
Three pints and a bottle, George.

11:48.248 --> 11:50.421
- Cheers, mate.
- Cheers, mate.

11:50.500 --> 11:52.594
A pleasure mate, alright?

11:52.669 --> 11:54.421
All mates together.

11:54.504 --> 11:56.802
You're thinking you're in.

11:56.882 --> 11:58.976
You ain't even started.

12:12.022 --> 12:15.071
- Ooh, here we go.
- Saw the game, then?

12:15.150 --> 12:17.699
Game? If you can call it that.

12:17.778 --> 12:22.249
Don't know how we're supposed to compete
in Europe if we can't even bury Bolton.

12:22.324 --> 12:24.418
Just play the fucking shot.

12:25.160 --> 12:28.039
Ooh, look at that!

12:28.121 --> 12:31.671
He's wiping the floor with you, Danny Boy.
Are you gonna have that?

12:31.750 --> 12:35.220
No one does that, do they, eh?
He's gonna beat you, Danny Boy.

12:36.213 --> 12:38.466
You watch yourself.

12:38.548 --> 12:40.642
Here we go, look.

12:48.100 --> 12:50.148
You're shit.

12:50.894 --> 12:54.148
- Good game, good game.
- He wiped the floor with you.

12:56.275 --> 12:58.369
Who the fuck are you, anyway?

12:58.443 --> 13:00.866
I ain't never seen you before.

13:00.946 --> 13:05.497
Just come here for a quiet game after
the match. We're all Shadwell, aren't we?

13:05.575 --> 13:08.795
- Oi, Danny.
- I'll bite your fucking nose off.

13:13.667 --> 13:18.138
There's a couple of quid still on the
table. Why don't you boys play on for me?

13:19.381 --> 13:21.475
Fuck off!

13:22.592 --> 13:24.686
See you later, Mo. Alright?

13:25.721 --> 13:27.815
Right you are, Gumbo.

13:30.600 --> 13:35.606
- Oh, come on, he's alright.
- You don't even fucking know him, Gumbo.

13:40.527 --> 13:43.076
This is your moment. Dig deep.

13:43.155 --> 13:46.159
That madness in you, that rage,
is your best friend.

13:46.908 --> 13:48.501
Use it.

14:07.304 --> 14:08.851
Spit teeth,

14:08.930 --> 14:12.104
spill blood.
Give up everything for the cause.

14:43.173 --> 14:46.302
- Fuck off. Fuck off!
- Go on, Gumbo.

14:46.385 --> 14:49.810
Danny Boy!

14:49.888 --> 14:52.482
- Fucking hell.
- Bolton boys.

14:52.557 --> 14:55.561
- They saw my shirt, steamed in.
- Right, boys.

14:58.480 --> 14:59.902
Shadwell Army!

15:51.575 --> 15:53.703
Get off! Get off!

15:55.912 --> 15:59.917
Shadwell Army! Shadwell Army!
Shadwell Army!

16:00.000 --> 16:02.298
- Shadwell Army!
- Yeah!

16:02.377 --> 16:05.301
This is what you've worked
and planned for.

16:05.380 --> 16:07.474
The evidence that sends men down.

16:07.549 --> 16:10.348
Names and faces
attached directly to actions.

16:10.427 --> 16:12.521
The rest is bullshit.

16:12.596 --> 16:14.849
Now you're doing your job.

16:14.931 --> 16:18.652
Shadwell Army! Shadwell Army!

16:30.447 --> 16:35.795
La, la, la, la! Let's go fucking
mental, let's go fucking mental!

16:35.869 --> 16:37.667
- La, la, la, la!
- Hey!

16:37.746 --> 16:42.343
Let's go fucking mental,
let's go fucking mental!

16:42.417 --> 16:45.591
La, la, la, la! La, la, la, la!

16:48.173 --> 16:51.052
And that's when you see
who you really are.

16:51.134 --> 16:53.887
And you may not like what you find out,
my friend.

17:02.687 --> 17:04.781
Alright?

17:05.232 --> 17:09.988
Shadwell Army! Shadwell Army!

17:10.069 --> 17:12.743
Shadwell Army! Shadwell Army!

17:12.821 --> 17:15.450
Gumbo! You want a bit of cheeky?

17:15.534 --> 17:20.790
Oh, fuck off. Don't give me none of that.
I don't need that shit, mate.

17:20.872 --> 17:24.672
- Oi, oi!
- Right, loser gets the drinks. His share.

17:24.751 --> 17:27.049
- Yeah.
- Here he goes.

17:27.127 --> 17:29.802
We played shit in England,
did just enough to get by,

17:29.881 --> 17:31.383
Europe via the back door.

17:31.466 --> 17:34.015
Fair play league?
Don't make me fucking laugh.

17:34.094 --> 17:36.267
Playing fair ain't the Shadwell way.

17:37.806 --> 17:39.729
You're right there, Mojo.

17:39.808 --> 17:43.563
- We think catenaccio's a frothy coffee.
- All the foreign muck, fancy dans,

17:43.645 --> 17:46.569
all they wanna do is show theirselves
on the European stage,

17:46.648 --> 17:48.446
get a leg-up to Spain, Italy, France.

17:48.525 --> 17:53.076
- Meanwhile ticket prices have doubled.
- Vukovitch is asset-stripping, ain't he?

17:53.154 --> 17:55.873
I'm telling ya, end of the season,
cash in his assets,

17:55.949 --> 17:57.747
sell the ground to developers.

17:57.826 --> 18:00.249
And we're back where we started,
in the shit.

18:01.121 --> 18:03.123
You alright, Vinnie?

18:03.206 --> 18:05.300
Not really, Danny Boy, no.

18:07.210 --> 18:09.463
When did we declare war on the North?

18:10.255 --> 18:12.474
Sorry about that, Vinnie.

18:12.549 --> 18:16.429
We had some provocation we had to deal
with. I didn't have time to phone.

18:16.511 --> 18:19.435
- Mo there got done by the Northerners.
- Who?

18:19.514 --> 18:21.608
D'you not know Mo, Vinnie?

18:23.268 --> 18:26.147
Yeah, well, no one's introduced us,
have they?

18:28.857 --> 18:30.985
Yeah, alright, alright.

18:31.776 --> 18:33.824
Let's see what you're made of, then.

18:35.822 --> 18:37.916
- Bread and butter.
- Pudding.

18:37.991 --> 18:39.743
- Home.
- Englishman's castle.

18:39.826 --> 18:41.453
- Football's coming.
- Home.

18:41.536 --> 18:42.879
- No surrender.
- IRA.

18:42.954 --> 18:44.297
- Gotcha.
- Belgrano.

18:44.372 --> 18:45.840
- Knick-knack.
- Pakiwack.

18:45.915 --> 18:48.009
Ooh, yeah, you're good, ain't you?

18:49.044 --> 18:51.513
Suck on this one. Ena Sharples.

18:52.380 --> 18:54.678
- What?
- Ena Sharples, mate.

18:54.758 --> 18:57.432
- I know, I know.
- What's he on about?

18:57.510 --> 19:00.059
- I know.
- Course you do. Know why?

19:00.138 --> 19:02.186
- Cos you're an Englishman, ain't ya?
- So am I,

19:02.265 --> 19:04.518
but I dunno what you're talking about.

19:04.601 --> 19:09.198
Last chance. Rovers Return, in the snug,
Ena Sharples and her mate. Old lady.

19:09.272 --> 19:12.742
Ena Sharples would share the snug
at the Rovers Return

19:12.817 --> 19:17.197
with her good friend Minnie Caldwell.
Their drink of choice, half of stout.

19:18.531 --> 19:20.954
That right? Did he get that right?

19:21.034 --> 19:23.162
He fucking did, yeah.

19:23.244 --> 19:25.087
You done it. Well done, son.

19:25.163 --> 19:28.007
Nice one. I didn't fucking know that.
Did you?

19:28.083 --> 19:30.632
- Can I buy you a drink, Vinnie?
- Yeah. Sweet.

19:40.887 --> 19:43.515
Mate, she was so fucking selling it.

19:43.598 --> 19:47.319
- Ah, she was lovely.
- She was about a 21 -year-old youth.

19:47.394 --> 19:50.398
- Yeah, 20 years younger than you.
- Anyway, let's go.

19:50.480 --> 19:53.108
- I don't wanna be here any more.
- Oh, leave it out.

19:53.191 --> 19:56.115
Oi! What are you doing?

19:56.194 --> 19:59.243
Just tying my shoelaces.
Fucking fast track.

19:59.322 --> 20:01.871
Immediate promotion
cos you're a bit brown.

20:01.950 --> 20:03.623
- Sir.
- Sir.

20:03.702 --> 20:05.875
Fuck off.

20:08.998 --> 20:12.719
- Why me?
- Who d'you think you're talking to?

20:12.794 --> 20:16.424
Sorry, sir, I couldn't help
but wonder why you picked me

20:16.506 --> 20:20.886
for this assignment when you've got
so many other special officers to pick.

20:20.969 --> 20:23.813
Well ,your targets
are very surveillance aware.

20:24.431 --> 20:26.934
They're not gonna see you coming,
are they?

20:27.016 --> 20:30.566
You're a Paki.
No one's gonna suss you as Bill.

20:31.396 --> 20:33.615
They think we're all racist at the Met.

20:45.994 --> 20:48.497
- Match day, nothing like it.
- Nothing like it.

20:48.580 --> 20:50.958
Bus to the ground,
pressed in with your mates.

20:51.040 --> 20:53.008
- You came by car.
- I still get the bus.

20:53.084 --> 20:54.427
The crackle, the banter,

20:54.502 --> 20:57.130
- three o'clock of a Saturday afternoon.
- Sunday.

20:57.213 --> 21:00.092
- It don't make a difference.
- Kick-off's half-fucking-one.

21:00.175 --> 21:03.349
Full English
then pies down the local boozer.

21:03.428 --> 21:06.307
- Well, gastro pub.
- And it don't do full English no more.

21:06.389 --> 21:09.393
I liked it better when it were The Rock.

21:09.476 --> 21:13.401
- Wanker!
- Sorry, mate, sorry.

21:13.480 --> 21:15.323
Go on.

21:16.649 --> 21:19.277
Come on, get into him.

21:19.360 --> 21:21.454
Come on!

21:23.156 --> 21:24.624
Come on.

21:26.659 --> 21:29.333
Get in, you lump of Russian fucking lard!

21:30.371 --> 21:32.465
- He's Serb.
- Listen to the shaki,

21:32.540 --> 21:34.918
been coming to Shadwell
all of five minutes.

21:35.001 --> 21:37.095
Don't pass it to the fucking Argie!

21:37.170 --> 21:41.016
- What is wrong with these English players?
- They're crap, ain't they?

21:41.090 --> 21:45.015
He's fat, he's round,
he bounces off the ground!

21:45.094 --> 21:48.815
Mateo! Mateo!

21:48.890 --> 21:52.815
He's fat, he's round,
he bounces off the ground! Mateo!

21:52.894 --> 21:55.443
Get in there, you French twat.
You see that?

21:55.522 --> 21:58.992
- Pulled out of the fucking tackle!
- Oh, he can fucking run!

21:59.901 --> 22:01.869
Go on! Go on!

22:10.411 --> 22:14.382
Hey, when are you lot gonna
actually get to a game this season, eh?

22:14.457 --> 22:17.711
- I'm saving up for Europe.
- Cheaper to get the ferry

22:17.794 --> 22:20.764
and get in the game at Tambuur
than it is to sit in the Kennel.

22:20.839 --> 22:24.639
Boys, this is the one and only time
Shadwell are gonna see anything of Europe.

22:24.717 --> 22:27.095
Amsterdam next round, for fuck's sake.

22:27.178 --> 22:31.934
And I have it on good authority that the
S-side are laying on a bit of a reception

22:32.016 --> 22:34.439
for our crew after the game.
Should be tasty.

22:34.519 --> 22:37.238
- Can we count you lads in?
- Of course you can, Vinnie.

22:37.313 --> 22:39.361
- Always up for it, you know that.
- Sweet.

22:39.440 --> 22:41.613
As long as we see some footie, yeah.

22:41.693 --> 22:44.742
- I'll get the refs in. Same again?
- About fucking time.

22:44.821 --> 22:46.744
- Cheers, Mo.
- Shut it out, Danny Boy.

22:46.823 --> 22:49.121
- He's getting the drinks.
- He's alright.

22:49.200 --> 22:50.952
Good as gold.

22:51.035 --> 22:54.460
- What's in his rucksack?
- Dunno. He always has it with him.

22:54.539 --> 22:56.883
- Leave it out.
- I'm not fuckin' handling it.

22:56.958 --> 22:59.507
Yeah, that's what I'm saying.
Never trust one.

22:59.586 --> 23:01.463
Oh, give it here. Hand it over.

23:01.546 --> 23:03.640
Are you sure, eh?

23:08.261 --> 23:11.606
- Oi, can I get a fucking drink?
- Squeaky bum time, Nicky.

23:11.681 --> 23:15.982
Two lagers and a packet of crisps.
I don't care what fucking flavour.

23:17.770 --> 23:21.775
Mohammed, I am truly fucking shocked!

23:32.952 --> 23:35.580
You dirty fucker.

23:35.663 --> 23:37.381
Yeah, nice.

23:37.457 --> 23:39.926
Jesus fucking Christ, look at that. No...

23:40.001 --> 23:42.003
I'm fucking, I'm having that, son.

23:42.086 --> 23:44.509
State of you.

23:44.589 --> 23:47.468
Gonna see what
you're made of in Amsterdam, are we?

23:47.550 --> 23:51.976
S-siders are a Yid crew.
Should be tasty for a Paki like yourself.

23:52.722 --> 23:55.601
- Yeah, I'm up for it, Vinnie, yeah.
- Yeah?

24:48.277 --> 24:50.530
Don't push any further.

24:50.613 --> 24:52.707
Your windpipe is just about to cave.

24:56.411 --> 24:58.209
Yeah, babes.

24:58.287 --> 25:01.416
Yeah, I'm just outside.
I've got a mate with me.

25:02.417 --> 25:04.511
Sweet.

25:05.920 --> 25:08.469
You're invited to dinner.

25:22.520 --> 25:26.070
- Who the fuck is this?
- Alison.

25:26.149 --> 25:28.243
Mohammed.

25:28.818 --> 25:30.741
Take his coat, babes.

25:30.820 --> 25:33.699
But whatever you do,
don't look in his bag.

25:35.825 --> 25:37.919
- No, you're alright.
- Right.

25:46.294 --> 25:48.638
He won't want a beer.

26:05.980 --> 26:07.948
You're Old Bill.

26:09.650 --> 26:12.278
And you just confirmed it.

26:12.361 --> 26:16.366
One second of hesitation, one moment
of doubt and you've let them in.

26:16.449 --> 26:19.123
- Them?
- Oh, don't be a twat.

26:19.202 --> 26:22.081
I'm undercover an' all.
No one told me you were coming.

26:22.163 --> 26:24.541
You're on the case, though,
I'll give you that.

26:24.624 --> 26:27.093
- No one told me there was another team.
- No?

26:29.879 --> 26:33.634
- You've heard of the Extremism Unit?
- I've heard of 'em.

26:33.716 --> 26:35.593
Never seen one before.

26:35.676 --> 26:40.102
Mmm-hm.
Operationally separate from the Met.

26:40.181 --> 26:43.355
Chances are
your control doesn't even know we're in.

26:43.434 --> 26:46.859
So what are Special Branch
doing getting involved with football?

26:46.938 --> 26:49.111
Uh-uh, no. Not football.

26:49.190 --> 26:50.908
- Politics.
- Eh?

26:50.983 --> 26:54.988
I came in deep cover with Shadwell BNP.
Times change, things happen.

26:55.071 --> 26:58.291
Moved on to the EDL.
The dogs are just collateral activity.

26:58.366 --> 27:00.118
They're not my targets.

27:00.201 --> 27:02.795
- You hungry?
- Famished.

27:02.870 --> 27:04.838
- Can you get me the salt?
- Yeah.

27:04.914 --> 27:09.010
I got my face known at the Kennel. Started
handing out leaflets, selling papers.

27:09.085 --> 27:10.803
Now I'm a trusted Branch Secretary,

27:10.878 --> 27:13.506
and I am risking my crown jewels
having a Paki in my house.

27:13.589 --> 27:16.263
- It's a good thing you've got a guard dog.
- Mmm.

27:16.342 --> 27:19.642
Yeah, well. You talk the talk.

27:19.720 --> 27:21.768
Where's your gaff?

27:21.848 --> 27:24.317
Down by the docks, over a kebab shop.

27:25.226 --> 27:27.524
Well, look, I go where the politics are.

27:27.603 --> 27:31.983
And football only comes into it
when we need a ready-made army for hire.

27:32.066 --> 27:35.070
Have you got any fucking idea
what you've walked into?

27:35.153 --> 27:37.531
Get that down you. Skin and bone.

27:41.075 --> 27:43.203
- There you go.
- Thanks, doll.

27:45.621 --> 27:48.295
- This is lovely.
- Don't take it to heart.

27:48.374 --> 27:51.719
I don't sweat it.
Look in someone's eyes, I know the score.

27:52.920 --> 27:56.049
Most of the time anyway.

28:00.803 --> 28:02.897
How did you clock me?

28:02.972 --> 28:06.727
I was on to you the minute I saw you.
But calling your round "refs",

28:06.809 --> 28:09.528
fuck me,
I thought I was back in the nick canteen.

28:09.604 --> 28:12.483
Easy with the lingo, gringo.

28:14.942 --> 28:17.570
Look, anyone threatens my cover,

28:18.613 --> 28:21.082
then I'll do whatever I have to.
You got it?

28:22.408 --> 28:24.911
Alright.
So you're going to Amsterdam, then?

28:24.994 --> 28:27.292
I'm getting a coach
with Nick and Danny Boy.

28:27.371 --> 28:31.001
Yeah, well, you can cope with them.
Just stay off my patch.

28:31.083 --> 28:33.177
I'll be busy cooking up some carnage.

28:41.677 --> 28:43.771
I thought I was on my own.

28:44.305 --> 28:46.399
Don't worry, you are.

29:56.877 --> 30:00.507
Shadwell Army! Shadwell Army!
Shadwell Army!

30:00.589 --> 30:03.468
- How you feeling, Gumbo?
- Alright.

30:03.551 --> 30:06.521
- Good boy.
- Gumbo, how about that one? Drink?

30:06.595 --> 30:09.940
- You got tickets to the match.
- We've got time for this, Gumbo.

30:10.016 --> 30:12.485
- Fifty Euros, mate, get your money out.
- Why?

30:12.560 --> 30:16.190
Get your money out. There you go, son.
Be here when you get back, alright?

30:16.272 --> 30:18.946
- Back where?
- From paradise.

30:19.025 --> 30:22.370
Get in there.

30:25.031 --> 30:26.658
I'm a fucking married man!

30:26.741 --> 30:30.291
Treat him gently, babe, he breaks easily.
Gumbo.

30:30.369 --> 30:32.792
Hello, darling.

30:32.872 --> 30:36.752
- He's not married, is he?
- Fucking right he is, mate. Two kids.

30:36.834 --> 30:40.964
Daft as him, by all accounts.
Used to take 'em down the Kennel.

30:41.047 --> 30:42.924
What d'you mean "used to"?

30:43.007 --> 30:46.432
D'you know how much it costs to get
your kids into a game these days?

30:46.510 --> 30:50.231
It's not just tickets, is it?
They want feeding, programmes, shirts,

30:50.306 --> 30:53.685
all that shit.
My old man used to get me in for a fiver.

30:53.768 --> 30:57.614
Last few years before he died,
he couldn't afford a fucking ticket.

30:57.688 --> 31:00.362
Yeah, but then you wouldn't be Shadwell,
would you?

31:00.441 --> 31:02.364
Yeah. What's your excuse?

31:02.443 --> 31:05.492
- Dogs or the mosque for me.
- You're fucked either way.

31:05.571 --> 31:08.996
So are you, then? Muzz? Jihad? Taliban?

31:11.160 --> 31:13.538
I'm in love.

31:13.621 --> 31:15.715
Alright. That's two down, Mojo.

31:17.458 --> 31:21.383
Mate, but I got my eye
on that brunette looking number.

31:21.462 --> 31:23.556
- What about you?
- Me?

31:24.340 --> 31:27.014
Mo, Mo, listen, mate. Mohammed, come here.

31:27.093 --> 31:30.063
There ain't two ways about it.
You've gotta get stuck in.

31:30.137 --> 31:33.641
You've gotta get that fucking
little brown dick of yours wet. Alright?

31:33.724 --> 31:37.524
Oh, it's Asian babes for you, isn't it?
Come on, we'll go and find you one.

31:37.603 --> 31:40.607
No, I think I'm alright.
I think... I'm already taken, mate.

31:40.689 --> 31:42.783
Fucking old school there, son.

31:43.776 --> 31:46.746
Old school, eh? You dirty dog!

31:46.821 --> 31:48.915
Race ya.

31:50.199 --> 31:53.829
I'll take both of ya.
One on me face, one on me cock.

32:00.918 --> 32:02.886
So...

32:05.047 --> 32:07.596
- Sorry.
- It's okay, I...

32:10.845 --> 32:14.099
- Can we just talk?
- Yeah, we can talk.

32:16.058 --> 32:18.152
Is it because of your religion?

32:19.520 --> 32:20.942
No.

32:22.982 --> 32:25.701
Have a seat.

32:25.776 --> 32:27.870
- I'm alright.
- Alright.

32:32.032 --> 32:34.160
Sorry, I don't trust people.

32:35.035 --> 32:37.584
It's alright,
I don't trust people, either.

32:38.706 --> 32:40.504
How can you? Hmph.

32:41.292 --> 32:43.545
But you just looked nice and...

32:43.627 --> 32:47.006
Let's go fucking mental, la, la, la, la!

32:47.089 --> 32:50.309
- Why did you come here?
- My mates set me up.

32:50.384 --> 32:52.728
- Hmm.
- Let's go fuckin' mental!

32:52.803 --> 32:55.181
You look different, you know.

32:55.264 --> 32:57.062
No, they're my mates, yeah.

32:57.141 --> 33:03.023
Yeah, but they're there in the streets
shouting, drinking, fighting.

33:03.105 --> 33:05.779
But you're not like that.

33:05.858 --> 33:07.906
Why would you want to be like that?

33:11.071 --> 33:13.073
Unconnected.

33:15.242 --> 33:18.462
- They're just drifting.
- Yeah, they're the lucky ones.

33:22.041 --> 33:24.089
It's easy to get lost.

33:29.548 --> 33:31.642
How do I get lost?

33:36.013 --> 33:38.357
I can help you with that.

33:38.432 --> 33:40.605
Don't be afraid.

33:43.854 --> 33:45.948
One is enough.

33:46.982 --> 33:49.360
Now close your eyes.

33:52.404 --> 33:55.203
I like your tunes.

33:55.282 --> 33:57.125
Are you local?

33:57.201 --> 33:59.579
Have you got any Jefferson Starship?

33:59.662 --> 34:01.790
So, Gumbo, how d'you get on?

34:01.872 --> 34:04.716
I tell you what,
I never knew you could do it like that.

34:04.792 --> 34:06.385
You dirty dog.

34:06.460 --> 34:08.337
- Here, smell that.
- For fuck's sake.

34:08.420 --> 34:12.971
- I had myself a hot sizzling Asian dish.
- Alright, Mo. How d'you get on?

34:13.050 --> 34:15.643
He don't mind. He got himself a blonde.
Didn't ya?

34:15.719 --> 34:18.097
I had some Polish.
Cold as ice, twice as fiery.

34:19.306 --> 34:21.103
Another dirty dog.

34:21.183 --> 34:23.857
- You old dog.
- Come on, you dogs!

34:23.936 --> 34:25.654
Come on, you dogs!

34:25.728 --> 34:30.280
We are Shadwell, the Kennel is our place

34:30.359 --> 34:33.078
Shadwell never, ever, ever
shall be slaves!

34:33.152 --> 34:35.906
- I'll get another round in?
- Have we got time?

34:35.989 --> 34:38.208
- One more, then we'll get in a taxi.
- Cool.

34:38.284 --> 34:41.629
- Three pints and a bottle of Bud?
- I've got something to set us up.

34:41.704 --> 34:44.206
- Ooh, lovely.
- I've already eaten.

34:44.290 --> 34:47.339
- You fuck-tard. It's space cake. Hash.
- Oh, right.

34:47.418 --> 34:49.512
Mo.

34:49.587 --> 34:55.469
- Open that up for me, will you?
- Fuck the taxi, we'll float to the match.

35:51.190 --> 35:54.034
Hey, time to go.

35:54.109 --> 35:56.407
- What was the score?
- Who the hell was that?

35:56.487 --> 35:58.489
- You too.
- What are you doing?

35:58.572 --> 36:01.576
I'm closing. Get the fuck out.

36:03.035 --> 36:08.212
Fucking hell, man. What are we, no-shows?
Come on, we promised Vinnie.

36:08.290 --> 36:09.712
Get up, get up.

36:09.792 --> 36:13.842
I can't believe we missed the fucking
game. Vinnie'll be going fucking mental!

36:16.006 --> 36:18.225
Fucking flares. It's the Old Bill.

36:18.300 --> 36:21.349
You fucking dirty pigs. Come on, boys!

36:21.428 --> 36:23.897
Fucking hell, man. Vinnie!

36:23.972 --> 36:26.020
Yes!

36:27.226 --> 36:30.526
- Vinnie!
- Where were you in the Second World War,

36:30.604 --> 36:33.528
- you fucking wanker?!
- Right, we fucking owe him.

36:33.607 --> 36:37.362
Boys, in you get. Right, come on!
Come on, boys!

36:37.444 --> 36:41.199
Come on, you fuck-tards! Fucking cunt.
You fucking cunt!

36:56.171 --> 36:57.844
Argh! Argh!

37:07.891 --> 37:10.690
Oi, you fucking cunt! You fucker!

37:12.771 --> 37:14.865
Agh!

37:44.720 --> 37:47.769
Shadwell Town's ﬁrst game in Europe was

37:47.848 --> 37:50.522
tarnished by trouble
from its travelling support.

37:50.601 --> 37:53.320
Fighting between rival fans
went into the early hours

37:53.395 --> 37:56.114
as the Dutch police
struggled to contain the violence.

37:56.190 --> 37:57.908
The club has denounced the trouble

37:57.983 --> 38:02.284
and promised life-time bans to
any supporters convicted in Amsterdam.

38:02.362 --> 38:05.582
Vince has been arrested
by the Amsterdam police.

38:07.034 --> 38:10.413
He has been arrested before.
He'll sort it out.

38:10.496 --> 38:12.590
Well, shouldn't we inform someone?

38:13.624 --> 38:16.753
He didn't even break cover
when his mother died.

38:16.835 --> 38:20.931
He has to protect the integrity
of his contacts. That's his priority.

38:21.006 --> 38:23.100
Why are you here?

38:27.304 --> 38:30.023
I got a bit fucked up.

38:30.098 --> 38:32.601
- Goes with the territory.
- Yeah.

38:34.770 --> 38:37.068
He seems immune.

38:37.147 --> 38:39.241
He comes back in bits sometimes.

38:42.069 --> 38:44.071
How does he cope?

38:44.154 --> 38:46.248
He has a good woman to sort him out.

38:47.533 --> 38:49.627
Don't. Just don't.

38:51.787 --> 38:53.881
I'm sorry.

38:56.500 --> 38:58.468
Actually, fuck it, I'm not.

38:58.544 --> 39:01.889
I'm going to sleep.
You can stay till it stops.

39:11.056 --> 39:14.526
Babe, I'm outside. Got mates with me.

39:14.601 --> 39:17.571
- Need to come in.
- Alright, give me two minutes.

39:17.646 --> 39:19.740
I need to get some clothes on.

39:21.441 --> 39:23.785
Mo. Mo, you need to wake up.

39:25.070 --> 39:27.198
- What?
- Wake up, Vinnie's outside.

39:27.281 --> 39:30.205
- You need to get out.
- Oh, fuck.

39:31.618 --> 39:34.417
What d'you mean Vinnie's outside?

39:34.496 --> 39:38.876
Oh, shit. The guy with the tattoos, I know
him. He's a nutter by the name of Hunt.

39:38.959 --> 39:41.382
I put him down for five years
on a GBH charge.

39:41.461 --> 39:42.883
Are you sure?

39:42.963 --> 39:45.091
How many people
d'you think look like that?

39:45.173 --> 39:47.926
- Alright, come on. Out the back.
- What?

39:48.010 --> 39:50.308
- Get round the back.
- What?

39:50.387 --> 39:53.231
No, we haven't the fucking time.
Get in the shed.

39:53.307 --> 39:55.901
- What d'you mean "get in the shed"?
- Get in the shed.

39:55.976 --> 39:58.604
- I'm not getting in the shed.
- Get in the shed.

39:59.980 --> 40:02.074
Fucking hell.

40:14.620 --> 40:16.714
Ta.

40:20.542 --> 40:24.217
- You got something a bit stronger, love?
- At eight in the morning?

40:30.427 --> 40:32.771
Thank you for letting us use your home.

40:33.931 --> 40:35.729
It's appreciated.

40:35.807 --> 40:37.901
I can take a hint.

40:51.365 --> 40:56.371
So, listen. I was banged up
yesterday with two of the leaders

40:56.453 --> 40:58.922
of Amsterdam's S-side. Now it turns out

40:58.997 --> 41:02.376
that they're in with a bloke
who runs about 12 firms in Europe.

41:02.459 --> 41:05.429
- Gervaas van Wildden.
- Oh, yeah, I know him.

41:05.504 --> 41:08.098
He's got political clout
and he can mobilise.

41:08.173 --> 41:10.847
- Right.
- Why are we talking about a Dutch geezer?

41:10.926 --> 41:13.270
My mum's got a mosque going up
outside her house.

41:13.345 --> 41:16.474
Look, fire-bombing,
attacking Jihadi stalls.

41:17.724 --> 41:20.352
Confronting muzzies wherever they are.

41:20.435 --> 41:23.439
See that's where the war's won now,
not in the ballot box.

41:23.522 --> 41:26.241
The closer UKIP get to power,
the tamer they become.

41:26.316 --> 41:28.865
BNP is a memory, the EDL is in tatters.

41:30.070 --> 41:32.664
- We can make our mark here.
- Yeah.

41:32.739 --> 41:35.834
The Dutch were offering knowledge,
connections, manpower.

41:35.909 --> 41:40.039
- Is that gonna put a stop to the mosque?
- But they need a stunt, don't they?

41:40.122 --> 41:45.299
If my contacts can say to van Wildden,
"we know the guys who organised this".

41:45.377 --> 41:48.130
So, what do we need?

41:48.839 --> 41:51.137
How about... this?

41:54.469 --> 41:57.643
- What you got there, mate?
- What you reckon?

42:00.934 --> 42:03.653
Oh, for... Is that...?

42:03.729 --> 42:06.608
Yeah, it's the real deal alright.
Is this peroxide?

42:06.690 --> 42:10.786
This battery back-up's a mess. And the
wiring. When did you put this together?

42:10.861 --> 42:12.534
- This morning.
- I thought so.

42:12.612 --> 42:15.115
That's what you get with these crude
online designs.

42:15.198 --> 42:17.917
This is how lads blow themselves up
in their back bedrooms.

42:17.993 --> 42:20.121
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Is that on a timer?

42:20.203 --> 42:22.251
- Is this running?
- No.

42:29.504 --> 42:32.098
It's gonna blow in about three minutes.

42:32.174 --> 42:34.518
- Oh, for fuck...
- D'you know how to defuse that?

42:34.593 --> 42:37.437
- No.
- Give it. Give it to me.

42:37.512 --> 42:40.436
- Easy. That's extremely volatile.
- Sorry.

42:40.515 --> 42:42.609
Oh, yeah.

42:46.730 --> 42:48.698
Fuck. Shit.

43:00.160 --> 43:02.254
Alright?

43:06.917 --> 43:09.170
- Get back in the house!
- Mo, get out!

43:09.252 --> 43:11.505
- Get back in the fucking house!
- Get out!

43:11.588 --> 43:13.932
- What is he doing in...
- Get back.

43:25.644 --> 43:27.521
What the fuck is he doing in there?

43:32.901 --> 43:34.528
You fucking...

43:34.611 --> 43:37.205
- Get in.
- You leaving it at that?

43:37.280 --> 43:38.998
Am I fuck.

43:40.367 --> 43:42.335
Get off him! Get the fuck off him!

43:42.410 --> 43:45.289
He came round to tell me
you'd been arrested!

43:45.372 --> 43:47.750
Whoa, hold your horses.

43:47.833 --> 43:50.803
What's a Paki fucking muzzie
doing in your shed?

43:50.877 --> 43:54.006
- Oh, don't you keep one in yours?
- I'm not Muslim. I'm a Sikh.

43:54.089 --> 43:55.591
- Can't you tell?
- Not really.

43:55.674 --> 43:59.804
- You all look the same to me.
- Who the fuck told you to make a bomb?

43:59.886 --> 44:03.811
Waiting round for your lot to do anything,
we'll be pushing up daisies.

44:08.478 --> 44:10.572
Who are you exactly?

44:11.523 --> 44:14.276
- He's with the lads.
- Come again?

44:14.359 --> 44:18.705
You heard. He's a Sikh.
They fucking hate the Jihads.

44:18.780 --> 44:20.202
I'm confused.

44:20.282 --> 44:22.660
Mohinder here is Shadwell, in't he?

44:22.742 --> 44:25.040
He's in the same crew
as Nick and Danny Boy.

44:25.120 --> 44:27.498
- The wannabes?
- Yeah, all mates together.

44:27.581 --> 44:31.677
That's right, innit, Mo? Eh? Shoulder
to fucking shoulder on the terraces.

44:31.751 --> 44:34.630
Fucking meat pie in one hand,
Bovril in the fucking other.

44:34.713 --> 44:36.636
- Ain't that right?
- Shadwell for life.

44:36.715 --> 44:38.638
- Yeah.
- Shut it.

44:38.717 --> 44:42.221
- What's he doing in your shed?
- Well, if you don't mind, lads,

44:42.304 --> 44:46.104
I think I need to talk about that
in private with the missus.

44:47.017 --> 44:49.145
Fair enough.

44:49.227 --> 44:53.277
- As for you, you backstabbing bastard...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

44:53.356 --> 44:58.032
Don't throw your ace away.
EDL used to like dark faces in the media.

44:58.111 --> 45:01.331
It emphasises that Islam is the enemy,
not race.

45:03.200 --> 45:05.294
You run with the dogs, yeah?

45:06.620 --> 45:09.169
You fancy a chance
of taking on the muzzies?

45:09.247 --> 45:11.716
They've pissed on my people long enough.
Yeah.

45:18.673 --> 45:20.767
Put your fucking trousers on.

45:21.885 --> 45:24.058
Get in the house.

45:24.137 --> 45:25.855
I'm still confused.

45:32.687 --> 45:34.781
Come on, boys.

45:37.150 --> 45:39.494
You're fucking unbelievable, ain't ya?

45:40.654 --> 45:42.748
What did I say to you?

45:42.822 --> 45:46.292
I said back off, stay clear,
leave well alone. And what d'you do?

45:46.368 --> 45:49.417
You show up at my house for a secret
meeting of EDL top brass.

45:49.496 --> 45:51.419
- I owe you a good kicking.
- Fuck off.

45:51.498 --> 45:53.375
All you had to do
was lie down and take it.

45:53.458 --> 45:54.960
- Alright?
- Alright.

45:55.043 --> 45:57.922
- Who's had to take it?
- Yours, Danny Boy. Right up there!

45:58.004 --> 46:00.302
Alright, leave it out, you dirty dog.

46:00.382 --> 46:03.761
Well, you were a dirty dog
in Amsterdam, I heard.

46:03.843 --> 46:06.346
You been telling tales out of class, Mojo?

46:06.429 --> 46:09.729
I'll see you at the match.
I've gotta see a dog about a man.

46:30.578 --> 46:32.421
We got an opportunity here.

46:34.958 --> 46:37.507
We need someone we can control
to front this.

46:39.004 --> 46:41.098
Time to play the Paki card.

46:44.092 --> 46:45.514
Let's go.

46:50.307 --> 46:53.652
- Lot of Dutch about.
- You got the tickets?

46:53.727 --> 46:55.821
What tickets? You got 'em.

46:57.147 --> 46:59.400
You fucking parsnip.

46:59.482 --> 47:01.280
Here are, mate. Do you love me?

47:01.359 --> 47:04.454
- Gumbo, what are you wearing?
- Alright, Gum?

47:04.529 --> 47:07.533
Campaign for Real Football.
I ain't putting any more money

47:07.615 --> 47:10.585
in Vukovitch's pocket.
I've brought my own sandwiches.

47:10.660 --> 47:13.083
He wants to put up ticket prices,
don't he.

47:13.163 --> 47:16.633
Here you are, here's your ticket.
Keep your money in your pocket.

47:16.708 --> 47:20.758
But it's not the point, Danny Boy, is it?
He's just got us over a fucking barrel.

47:32.098 --> 47:34.521
- Someone taking the piss?
- Do what, mate?

47:35.769 --> 47:39.023
Can't just come here and wipe their feet
on our doormat.

47:39.105 --> 47:41.233
- Here we go.
- You tooled?

47:41.316 --> 47:43.239
- Nothing.
- Fists then.

47:46.154 --> 47:47.451
Evening, mate.

47:47.530 --> 47:49.532
- Afternoon.
- Nice shirt by the way.

47:49.616 --> 47:50.833
- Thanks, mate.
- And?

47:50.909 --> 47:53.037
- Sell us some tickets?
- What?

47:53.119 --> 47:56.840
- You got some tickets spare?
- You come here, our country, our manor,

47:56.915 --> 47:59.964
- our ground, and you ain't got tickets?
- Go on, sell us them.

48:00.043 --> 48:02.546
I wouldn't sell you them
for all the tea in China.

48:02.629 --> 48:04.882
- How... How much?
- Gumbo.

48:04.964 --> 48:07.888
- I'll give you one hundred per ticket.
- Hang on, how much? Like he says.

48:07.967 --> 48:10.265
- What?
- We got four. How much?

48:10.345 --> 48:13.019
These are main stand,
over the director's box.

48:13.098 --> 48:15.396
- Give you 100.
- I could get 200 for each.

48:15.475 --> 48:18.194
- One-fifty, man.
- Give us your ticket, Gumbo.

48:18.269 --> 48:20.067
Danny Boy?

48:20.146 --> 48:22.945
Fucking kidding me, mate. Another game.
200.

48:23.024 --> 48:25.322
There we go. There you go, lads.

48:25.402 --> 48:27.700
- Fucking hell, Nick.
- There we go.

48:27.779 --> 48:29.747
- Alright.
- Enjoy the match.

48:29.823 --> 48:31.746
- Good luck there.
- See you later.

48:31.825 --> 48:33.668
Right, it's my round.

48:33.743 --> 48:35.370
I hope we fucking hammer ya!

48:35.453 --> 48:38.753
It'll be alright.

48:38.832 --> 48:42.336
It's nil-nil, ten minutes to go.
Come on, we can do it, boys. Come on.

48:42.419 --> 48:47.220
That's the third chance the
Argentinean forward has let go begging.

48:47.298 --> 48:49.642
Are Shadwell ever going to score this goal

48:49.717 --> 48:52.812
that would take them
into the next round of the Europa Cup?

48:52.887 --> 48:55.936
Here they come again.
The young Italian dashing down the wing.

48:56.015 --> 48:57.858
- Go on!
- He crosses.

48:57.934 --> 49:00.028
Goal!

49:00.103 --> 49:02.731
Finally, Aguillan has hit the net

49:02.814 --> 49:05.237
and done what he's been
threatening to do all night.

49:05.316 --> 49:08.035
Argentina! Argentina!

49:08.778 --> 49:10.530
Argentina! Argentina!

49:13.950 --> 49:17.045
Yes! Can't believe it.

49:19.164 --> 49:21.258
Get in. Shut up shop, let's...

49:21.332 --> 49:23.426
Come on!

49:26.379 --> 49:28.473
Not you. Mojo.

49:29.466 --> 49:31.560
A word.

49:39.476 --> 49:41.570
Go on, Danny Boy.

49:52.864 --> 49:58.712
Did it, Danny. We've done it. Come here.

50:04.209 --> 50:06.428
You understand how important this is?

50:11.382 --> 50:13.851
Just here on the left by the kebab shop.

50:18.556 --> 50:21.275
So you're with us, then?

50:21.351 --> 50:23.445
Yeah.

50:26.523 --> 50:28.617
Thanks for the lift.

50:44.958 --> 50:46.301
Wait.

51:15.488 --> 51:17.582
Thanks.

51:52.066 --> 51:55.070
How many miles were you running
before the injury?

51:55.153 --> 51:58.202
- 12 miles a day.
- Struggle getting up the stairs in

51:58.281 --> 52:00.204
the morning,
I don't know how you manage that.

52:00.283 --> 52:03.127
It's like having toothache in your legs.

52:03.202 --> 52:05.330
- Would you excuse me a second?
- Yeah.

52:19.552 --> 52:21.771
How did you get in here?

52:21.846 --> 52:25.601
Why didn't you tell me that Special Branch
are in at Shadwell EDL?

52:26.976 --> 52:29.070
Not here.

52:38.237 --> 52:40.956
I don't have any access
to that information.

52:41.032 --> 52:43.410
I walked slap into him,
he's shooing me off.

52:43.493 --> 52:46.087
- Can you blame him?
- Which is a bit of a problem

52:46.162 --> 52:50.167
seeing as I've been adopted as bait
for a march against Shadwell mosque.

52:50.249 --> 52:52.593
Who gives a fuck about that?

52:52.669 --> 52:55.422
You're supposed to be tracking
football games.

52:55.505 --> 52:59.100
With all due respect, sir,
you put me on site without back-up,

52:59.175 --> 53:03.601
without relevant information about other
operations happening on the same turf.

53:03.680 --> 53:07.776
Shit gets messy. But then what would you
know about it, anyway, eh?

53:07.850 --> 53:10.023
Sitting behind your desk.

53:10.103 --> 53:12.197
Hmm?

53:12.814 --> 53:14.737
You finished?

53:14.816 --> 53:17.569
You think I'm some suit
who knows fuck all?

53:19.696 --> 53:21.790
And what the fuck has this gotta do

53:21.864 --> 53:24.743
with building relationships
with your own targets?

53:24.826 --> 53:29.753
If things go political, they'll be on
the front line. I can nail all of 'em.

53:29.831 --> 53:32.300
How long have I got?

53:32.375 --> 53:34.548
As long as Shadwell stay in Europe.

53:34.627 --> 53:38.097
To be honest, I thought they'd be
out on their arse first round.

53:38.172 --> 53:40.345
How's the new kid doing,
the little Eyetie?

53:40.425 --> 53:42.644
I ain't got a clue. I ain't seen him much.

53:42.719 --> 53:45.222
Well, what the hell have you been doing?

53:45.304 --> 53:49.810
Compiling a detailed database of
individuals, meetings, discussions,

53:49.892 --> 53:53.192
including conspiracy
to cause public disorder.

53:53.271 --> 53:57.902
Including a demonstration on the mosque,
which I don't wanna get involved with.

53:58.484 --> 54:03.490
Because you bottled it. It might actually
give you a little bit of credibility.

54:03.573 --> 54:06.497
I grew up going to that mosque.

54:06.576 --> 54:10.672
They know full well that I'm a police
officer. I risk breaking my cover.

54:10.747 --> 54:14.672
Especially as I can't even back out
without drawing attention to myself.

54:14.751 --> 54:17.425
Listen, son, don't worry about the march.

54:17.503 --> 54:20.507
My boys will look after you.

54:20.590 --> 54:24.595
- Alright, Trev?
- Yeah. Oh, this is DC Anrawi.

54:24.677 --> 54:27.226
- One of our brightest prospects.
- Sir.

54:29.891 --> 54:34.362
You stick with your targets
and you leave the political stuff alone.

54:34.437 --> 54:37.156
And I still wanna know about
the little Eyetie.

54:39.066 --> 54:42.161
So he's a prospect, is he?
Not like in our day, eh?

54:42.236 --> 54:44.113
Don't worry about him.

54:44.197 --> 54:47.451
You mark my words,
he'll be out on a medical in six months.

55:39.794 --> 55:42.343
Didn't think we'd see you again,
PC Mohammed.

55:42.421 --> 55:46.301
That's DC Mohammed.
I've been promoted, brother.

55:57.270 --> 55:59.364
D'you remember how?

56:19.041 --> 56:24.093
Side-by-side with this country's freedom
we must carry our faith.

56:24.171 --> 56:29.302
Side-by-side with this nation's equality,
we must walk with prophet...

56:29.385 --> 56:32.355
Have you had
any more trouble from the right-wingers?

56:32.430 --> 56:35.024
No more excrement through the post
than usual.

56:35.099 --> 56:36.601
..co-existing with...

56:36.684 --> 56:40.530
They're planning
to hit the new mosque next Friday.

56:40.605 --> 56:44.075
- But what is this freedom?
- And you're here to tell us this?

56:44.150 --> 56:46.244
Britain's Got Talent?

56:46.944 --> 56:49.038
There'll be 15, 20 of them tops.

56:49.113 --> 56:51.832
- On TV...
- You boys can more than double that.

56:51.908 --> 56:54.878
- ...your children home from school...
- How good's your info?

56:54.952 --> 56:57.501
- ...should be studying...
- I'm here, aren't I?

56:57.580 --> 56:59.708
- ...praying.
- We'll deal with this

56:59.790 --> 57:01.667
cos the police don't do anything.

57:01.751 --> 57:05.301
We need to show some force,
show them we ain't going anywhere.

57:05.379 --> 57:09.555
- Pushed like drugs at our people.
- We can put on a display then, can't we?

57:09.634 --> 57:13.013
They pollute us, they poison us.

57:13.095 --> 57:16.065
- If we put on an act, is that blasphemy?
- ...internet...

57:16.140 --> 57:19.610
- We're protecting the prophet's honour.
- Lifestyle magazines.

57:19.685 --> 57:21.779
- That'll be alright.
- I can't be involved.

57:21.854 --> 57:23.606
This is kafir's freedom.

57:23.689 --> 57:26.112
In the name of Allah,
your father's sat over there.

57:26.192 --> 57:29.867
- This is kafir's democracy.
- I don't know that man.

57:29.946 --> 57:32.699
This is kafir's equality.
And he doesn't know me.

57:32.782 --> 57:36.878
- This is the freedom of kafir.
- You know you are welcome back here.

57:36.953 --> 57:39.081
- The community's changing.
- Not quick enough.

57:39.163 --> 57:44.670
The only true freedom
is in sacrifice to Allah.

58:24.375 --> 58:26.548
Muslim bombers off our streets!

58:26.627 --> 58:28.721
Muslim bombers off our streets!

58:28.796 --> 58:31.345
Muslim bombers off our streets!

58:31.424 --> 58:35.600
# Keep St George in thy heart,
keep it English #

58:35.678 --> 58:39.524
- # Keep St George... #
- No turning back, Paki.

58:39.598 --> 58:42.602
# Keep St George in thy heart,
keep it English #

58:43.644 --> 58:47.069
# Keep it English till my dying day #

58:47.148 --> 58:50.527
# No surrender! No surrender #

58:50.609 --> 58:53.453
# No surrender to the Taliban #

58:53.529 --> 58:56.658
# No surrender! No surrender! #

58:56.741 --> 58:58.835
# No surrender to the Taliban! #

58:58.909 --> 59:01.503
Hold your line.

59:05.833 --> 59:09.007
- Whose streets?
- Our streets!

59:13.632 --> 59:21.767
Muslim bombers off our streets!
Muslim bombers off our streets!

59:31.192 --> 59:33.286
What you fucking nicking him for?

59:45.289 --> 59:47.667
Danny! Danny!

59:52.922 --> 59:55.141
Danny!

59:59.261 --> 01:00:02.640
What are you arresting him for?
I've done worse than that!

01:00:02.723 --> 01:00:04.316
Fuck off!

01:00:04.391 --> 01:00:07.816
Get him in the van, lads.
Closing the door, closing the door.

01:00:08.521 --> 01:00:11.445
He's been picked up.
He's in the fucking police van.

01:00:17.571 --> 01:00:20.700
Just saved your sorry arse.

01:00:30.292 --> 01:00:32.545
- Where's Vinnie?
- He's not here.

01:00:32.628 --> 01:00:34.630
I can hardly go to A&E, can I?

01:00:34.713 --> 01:00:36.465
Alright.

01:00:40.344 --> 01:00:44.599
Right. Turn round.
Let's see the other one.

01:00:45.933 --> 01:00:47.685
Okay.

01:00:49.770 --> 01:00:51.864
Alright?

01:00:54.400 --> 01:00:56.494
Isn't adultery a sin for you?

01:00:59.029 --> 01:01:02.249
No nice Muslim girl next door
to make the parents proud?

01:01:05.953 --> 01:01:08.752
There was. It didn't work out.

01:01:08.831 --> 01:01:10.925
Didn't work out for who?

01:01:14.587 --> 01:01:19.434
Hmph. How long did you leave it
before you let her down?

01:01:19.508 --> 01:01:21.602
You're hurting.

01:01:23.179 --> 01:01:24.681
Sorry.

01:01:24.763 --> 01:01:27.812
You don't break someone
without breaking yourself.

01:01:29.018 --> 01:01:34.024
- Found that out.
- That's good. I don't have to break you.

01:01:35.983 --> 01:01:38.077
Already been done.

01:01:54.501 --> 01:01:56.549
You not worried about Vinnie?

01:01:57.796 --> 01:02:00.174
Yeah, I'm worried about Vinnie.

01:02:00.257 --> 01:02:02.351
Not worried enough, obviously.

01:02:09.099 --> 01:02:11.193
The spark went long ago.

01:02:12.186 --> 01:02:15.531
Starts wearing his socks in bed,
makes you wonder.

01:02:16.815 --> 01:02:20.115
- He could walk in on us and...
- I can't hear this.

01:02:22.071 --> 01:02:24.165
All about the hunt, is that it?

01:02:24.240 --> 01:02:27.084
He's a fellow cop. I can't do it to him.

01:02:28.035 --> 01:02:30.083
It's me you could've done it to.

01:02:35.251 --> 01:02:38.300
Innit, a little bit?
Like we're on our way to a match.

01:02:38.379 --> 01:02:40.473
I was proud of you though ...

01:02:42.549 --> 01:02:44.677
You fucking squeaky bastard.

01:02:45.386 --> 01:02:47.559
- Alright, lads?
- Oi, oi.

01:02:47.638 --> 01:02:50.983
- Can I get a light off you, mate?
- Lads. How long you been up here?

01:02:51.058 --> 01:02:53.152
About half an hour.

01:02:55.604 --> 01:02:58.232
Mo. You missed the rumble at the mosque.

01:02:59.650 --> 01:03:02.449
You were the only bloke to get arrested.
How come?

01:03:02.528 --> 01:03:04.872
What's the problem, Danny Boy?

01:03:04.947 --> 01:03:07.041
I'll tell you what my problem is.

01:03:08.033 --> 01:03:10.161
He never gets stuck in.

01:03:10.244 --> 01:03:13.339
Takes a few knocks and then bails out.

01:03:13.414 --> 01:03:15.337
He's never there when it kicks up.

01:03:16.625 --> 01:03:18.753
Danny Boy, fuck's sake.

01:03:18.836 --> 01:03:22.431
He turns up out of nowhere,
he wants to know everybody's business,

01:03:22.506 --> 01:03:25.385
and he conveniently gets arrested
when the shit hits.

01:03:25.467 --> 01:03:27.890
And what's more,
he's fucking Vinnie's missus.

01:03:27.970 --> 01:03:29.688
- Oi, that's my...
- Ohh...

01:03:29.763 --> 01:03:32.687
Right, shut it.
That's my fucking business, isn't it?

01:03:33.726 --> 01:03:35.069
Problem?

01:03:35.144 --> 01:03:36.942
I'm sorting it, Dave.

01:03:37.021 --> 01:03:38.364
Strip.

01:03:39.940 --> 01:03:41.863
That's right, strip.

01:03:41.942 --> 01:03:44.786
Bit cold for that, innit?

01:03:48.490 --> 01:03:51.869
- Give us your fucking clothes.
- Alright, alright!

01:03:54.455 --> 01:03:58.460
- What is it you're looking for, exactly?
- Cameras, mics. What?

01:04:00.794 --> 01:04:03.388
He's one of them undercover filmmakers.

01:04:03.464 --> 01:04:07.514
Me brother went down on vidi-evidence
made from an undercover doc-maker.

01:04:07.593 --> 01:04:09.595
Anything?

01:04:09.678 --> 01:04:13.182
- No, there's nothing here.
- Nothing, no. So?

01:04:14.516 --> 01:04:18.692
I'll tell you something. If he's not
a journo he's something even worse.

01:04:20.064 --> 01:04:22.158
He's a fucking muzzie.

01:04:23.567 --> 01:04:25.615
What have you got to say?

01:04:29.198 --> 01:04:34.329
Oh. Danny Boy, mate. You've dropped one
there. He's only fucking circumscribed.

01:04:34.411 --> 01:04:36.755
This Muslim's Jewish on his mother's side.

01:04:36.830 --> 01:04:39.174
- We hate Yids.
- No, we don't.

01:04:39.249 --> 01:04:41.502
- What?
- That's the BNP. The BNP hates Yids.

01:04:41.585 --> 01:04:43.883
- I hate the BNP.
- Exactly, right.

01:04:43.962 --> 01:04:46.511
- We're EDL now.
- No. No, we're not.

01:04:46.590 --> 01:04:48.809
- Eh?
- We love Israel.

01:04:48.884 --> 01:04:49.976
Huh?

01:04:50.052 --> 01:04:52.521
Our enemy's enemy is our friend.

01:04:54.223 --> 01:04:56.351
Do try to keep up, you fucking wanker.

01:04:56.433 --> 01:04:59.983
Stone me, documentary maker, muzzie.
You'll be saying he's a copper next.

01:05:00.062 --> 01:05:02.485
Like John and Trev?
John and Trev were coppers.

01:05:02.564 --> 01:05:05.659
- Yeah.
- Get the drinks in, there's a good lad.

01:05:05.734 --> 01:05:07.736
- Alright, son.
- Yeah, go on.

01:05:07.820 --> 01:05:10.118
- Oh, alright, yeah.
- Dave. Dave?

01:05:10.197 --> 01:05:14.327
It's a shame about that. Better safe
than sorry, though, mate, eh?

01:05:16.495 --> 01:05:19.840
You alright, man? Clean as a whistle.

01:05:36.682 --> 01:05:38.776
- Gums?
- Alright, son?

01:05:40.936 --> 01:05:43.030
You're Old Bill.

01:05:46.316 --> 01:05:49.445
- Shh.
- No, don't worry, I won't tell no one.

01:05:50.571 --> 01:05:52.665
It's all the same to me, son.

01:05:53.449 --> 01:05:55.543
Alright?

01:06:19.308 --> 01:06:22.152
Gumbo, you fucking muppet.

01:06:30.694 --> 01:06:32.287
- Yes!
- Miss.

01:06:32.362 --> 01:06:35.286
Yeah, fuck off, that was in, mate.

01:06:35.365 --> 01:06:37.584
- There's your army.
- Four-one.

01:06:37.659 --> 01:06:41.334
Who can you trust there to raid
the mosque? I mean Danny Boy's keen.

01:06:41.413 --> 01:06:42.756
He's too keen.

01:06:42.831 --> 01:06:45.004
Yes!

01:06:45.083 --> 01:06:47.882
Backs against the wall,
I don't want a show-off.

01:06:49.379 --> 01:06:52.804
Little twat doesn't even realise
that Muslims are circumcised.

01:06:52.883 --> 01:06:54.977
He's no use to us.

01:06:55.552 --> 01:06:56.849
Hey!

01:06:56.929 --> 01:07:00.399
Vinnie'll round up the runts of
the litter, pack 'em off to the game.

01:07:00.474 --> 01:07:02.351
Does that include the fucking shaki?

01:07:02.434 --> 01:07:07.565
Some of the scariest fuckers I've met
in this movement have been ethnics.

01:07:08.982 --> 01:07:11.531
Maybe it's self-hatred,
maybe they just feel

01:07:11.610 --> 01:07:14.705
they need to prove themselves
by trying harder.

01:07:23.997 --> 01:07:27.171
- You sleep alright, Gumbo?
- Not bad, son. Yourself?

01:07:27.251 --> 01:07:30.221
- Yeah, lovely.
- Yeah. Not bad them bunks, are they?

01:07:31.338 --> 01:07:33.511
Oi, oi.

01:07:33.590 --> 01:07:36.218
Oh, that's nice.
We've got a welcoming committee.

01:07:37.678 --> 01:07:40.932
- Got a blade?
- Take your pick.

01:07:53.151 --> 01:07:58.157
Dogs, dogs, dog, dogs, dogs,
dogs, dogs, dogs, dogs, dogs...

01:07:58.240 --> 01:07:59.992
Come on!

01:08:58.258 --> 01:09:00.352
You look terrible.

01:09:02.011 --> 01:09:03.810
How d'you find me?

01:09:03.889 --> 01:09:06.517
Vinnie followed you
the night he brought you home.

01:09:06.600 --> 01:09:08.944
Not much of a homemaker, are you?

01:09:09.603 --> 01:09:10.979
Huh.

01:09:12.189 --> 01:09:14.112
Present.

01:09:25.952 --> 01:09:29.296
He asked the Specials
to give him everything they had on you.

01:09:29.372 --> 01:09:32.718
- He's watching your back.
- Huh. That's nice of him.

01:09:34.252 --> 01:09:36.345
Get out while you can.

01:09:38.715 --> 01:09:41.059
The nasties
who sat around my kitchen table

01:09:41.134 --> 01:09:43.511
saying they needed a martyr to the cause,

01:09:43.595 --> 01:09:45.723
and your name came up.

01:09:46.430 --> 01:09:49.104
- No.
- What did Vinnie say about that?

01:09:49.184 --> 01:09:52.563
He has to appear to go along with it
or they'll be looking at him.

01:09:55.607 --> 01:09:58.076
Yeah, two for the price of one, eh?

01:09:59.027 --> 01:10:03.533
Gets in with his fascist mates
and gets rid of the competition as well.

01:10:05.575 --> 01:10:07.794
Hmm.

01:10:08.245 --> 01:10:11.749
Alright, come on.
What they got in store for me, eh?

01:10:11.832 --> 01:10:14.551
Come on! Cos I'll take anyone on!

01:10:15.168 --> 01:10:19.389
What, you like a battle, do you?
Wanna take on the Metropolitan Police?

01:10:19.464 --> 01:10:22.183
The English Defence League
and Special Bra...

01:10:57.419 --> 01:10:59.842
Does he really wear his socks in bed?

01:10:59.921 --> 01:11:02.015
Yeah.

01:11:09.097 --> 01:11:11.145
- Want some?
- Hmm.

01:11:14.144 --> 01:11:16.192
I want this.

01:11:19.649 --> 01:11:21.651
I want you.

01:11:21.735 --> 01:11:24.204
This. Here. Now.

01:11:24.279 --> 01:11:26.623
Everything.

01:11:26.698 --> 01:11:29.247
What, you see yourself
doing the school run?

01:11:31.244 --> 01:11:33.338
Yeah. Why not?

01:11:34.539 --> 01:11:36.382
Me, you.

01:11:36.458 --> 01:11:38.756
House in the suburbs.

01:11:38.835 --> 01:11:40.087
Kids.

01:11:41.379 --> 01:11:44.474
You go to work, I pick 'em up.

01:11:45.467 --> 01:11:48.186
In-laws, friends.

01:11:48.261 --> 01:11:51.811
- Late night cocoa.
- I do a mean cocoa.

01:11:51.890 --> 01:11:54.018
Do you?

01:11:54.976 --> 01:11:57.650
Take a look at yourself.

01:11:57.729 --> 01:11:59.697
Oh.

01:12:07.697 --> 01:12:09.665
No.

01:12:09.741 --> 01:12:11.835
Oh, you could play the part.

01:12:12.869 --> 01:12:14.963
You could pay the mortgage on time.

01:12:17.040 --> 01:12:19.042
But you'd still be undercover.

01:12:19.125 --> 01:12:21.924
Be another job, another disguise.

01:12:25.173 --> 01:12:27.926
Isn't that what everyone does? No?

01:12:28.844 --> 01:12:31.063
Plays the part?

01:12:31.763 --> 01:12:33.731
I wasn't playing just now.

01:12:36.726 --> 01:12:38.820
But, Mo, you need to get out.

01:12:38.895 --> 01:12:41.489
You need to go today. Now.

01:12:41.565 --> 01:12:43.317
No.

01:12:43.400 --> 01:12:45.619
- Mo, they're...
- No, no, there's no Mo.

01:12:48.280 --> 01:12:50.374
Mo's someone I've created

01:12:50.448 --> 01:12:52.746
and I just killed him.

01:12:52.826 --> 01:12:54.920
My name's Mohammed.

01:12:56.580 --> 01:12:58.628
And I'm seriously fucking mad.

01:13:00.584 --> 01:13:02.632
Now you watch me burn.

01:13:23.315 --> 01:13:24.532
This,

01:13:24.608 --> 01:13:28.988
this cannot be allowed to happen.

01:13:30.655 --> 01:13:33.033
Do I wanna open a pork butcher's
in Karachi?

01:13:34.701 --> 01:13:37.830
I mean what the fuck are you doing here?

01:13:37.913 --> 01:13:42.840
You don't like us, we don't like you.
Here's your fare, fuck off!

01:13:45.045 --> 01:13:47.093
This mosque will open.

01:13:49.591 --> 01:13:52.014
The old one, then.

01:13:52.093 --> 01:13:54.187
Take a hit.

01:13:54.721 --> 01:13:58.316
Let us have our splash.
We'll give you good warning.

01:13:59.768 --> 01:14:01.691
You take the front page headlines,

01:14:01.770 --> 01:14:04.774
we'll get sympathy
and extra funds from the council.

01:14:04.856 --> 01:14:06.733
We're not against politics.

01:14:06.816 --> 01:14:08.784
Oh, we got a language then.

01:14:08.860 --> 01:14:13.206
I'm gonna have to discuss that
with my brothers. Nothing's that simple.

01:14:18.411 --> 01:14:21.005
Me, I'd just get on with it.

01:14:21.081 --> 01:14:23.083
You talk to who you have to.

01:14:34.844 --> 01:14:37.188
- Did that go alright?
- Yeah.

01:14:43.770 --> 01:14:48.992
Nil-nil, boys. One goal'll do us.
European night. Nothing like it.

01:14:49.067 --> 01:14:52.788
Hotdog stalls, car alarms, police sirens,
smell of testosterone.

01:14:52.862 --> 01:14:55.160
Shut up, Nick,
no one wants to fucking know.

01:14:55.240 --> 01:14:57.334
Pills and thrills, Nicky boy.

01:14:59.494 --> 01:15:01.542
There you are, mate.

01:15:06.292 --> 01:15:09.136
What the fuck you doing?
I was saving one for Gumbo.

01:15:09.212 --> 01:15:10.680
He won't mind.

01:15:10.755 --> 01:15:12.803
You greedy fucker.

01:15:16.428 --> 01:15:18.977
Enjoy the match. I'm needed elsewhere.

01:15:22.726 --> 01:15:26.321
Look at him. Seriously, mate. Look, look.

01:15:26.396 --> 01:15:29.821
He's up to something.
What's he fucking doing with Vinnie?

01:15:33.153 --> 01:15:35.247
Fucking flash car.

01:15:40.326 --> 01:15:42.670
Are you ready for your big moment?

01:15:42.746 --> 01:15:46.046
The old mosque is gonna take a hit
and you are gonna deliver it.

01:15:47.125 --> 01:15:49.924
Only you can get in without being noticed.

01:15:50.003 --> 01:15:53.007
Don't worry, son, we got you covered.

01:15:53.089 --> 01:15:56.844
Gonna time it for the ﬁnal whistle
before the crowd's out of the match.

01:15:56.926 --> 01:15:58.928
Streets'll be empty.

01:15:59.012 --> 01:16:00.685
You'll have a clear route.

01:16:00.764 --> 01:16:07.022
Vukovitch, Vukovitch, out, out, out.

01:16:07.103 --> 01:16:09.777
- Nicky.
- What's up, Gumbo?

01:16:09.856 --> 01:16:14.987
Gotta make a stand, Nick.
He's putting up ticket prices again.

01:16:15.070 --> 01:16:19.200
Wants to change the fucking name.
Canary Wharf Panthers or something.

01:16:19.282 --> 01:16:23.003
We're gonna boycott every home game,
starting tonight.

01:16:23.078 --> 01:16:25.706
- It's the quarter final.
- Don't matter, mate.

01:16:25.789 --> 01:16:27.507
We've gotta make a stand.

01:16:27.582 --> 01:16:31.507
This is the biggest game in our history.
No, man. No, fuck it, I'm going in.

01:16:31.586 --> 01:16:37.559
- You're missing the point, Danny.
- Make room, you fuckin' anoraks. Come on.

01:16:37.634 --> 01:16:41.935
- We ain't seen a fucking game this season.
- Vukovitch, Vukovitch, out, out!

01:16:44.057 --> 01:16:47.561
Okay, so Hunt has
something that we want you to deliver

01:16:47.644 --> 01:16:49.988
- to your friends at the mosque.
- It's simple.

01:17:08.206 --> 01:17:12.052
Good job. There's a lot to be said
for these old school designs.

01:17:12.127 --> 01:17:14.596
George, is it armed?

01:17:14.671 --> 01:17:16.673
I'm just setting it now.

01:17:16.756 --> 01:17:19.225
Alright, we're on.

01:17:19.300 --> 01:17:20.392
Easy.

01:17:20.468 --> 01:17:24.598
Get yourself ten yards clear when it
blows or it'll be Mo-fucking-kebab.

01:17:24.681 --> 01:17:26.729
Alright, alright. Steady.

01:17:26.808 --> 01:17:28.731
- Dave, give us a hand.
- Fuck off.

01:17:28.810 --> 01:17:32.485
D'you want it done properly or not?
Come on, let's do it.

01:17:32.564 --> 01:17:37.115
- Easy, easy.
- Oh, for fuck's sake.

01:17:37.193 --> 01:17:39.195
There we go.

01:17:43.449 --> 01:17:46.874
Don't worry, son, you're not on your own.

01:17:46.953 --> 01:17:50.878
George will be following you
every step of the way.

01:17:50.957 --> 01:17:54.211
What you waiting for?

01:18:10.476 --> 01:18:12.570
Yeah, going, going, going. Yes.

01:18:13.897 --> 01:18:16.776
Good boy, good boy.

01:18:43.259 --> 01:18:47.480
Vukovitch, Vukovitch, out, out, out!
Vukovitch, Vukovitch, out, out, out!

01:18:47.555 --> 01:18:51.560
Gumbo. What the fuck is going on?
I thought there was a match on.

01:18:51.643 --> 01:18:53.941
Yeah, we're at war with Russia, ain't we.

01:18:54.854 --> 01:18:58.324
- Alright, remember our little secret?
- I ain't told no one.

01:18:58.399 --> 01:19:01.073
I know you haven't,
that's why I know I can trust you.

01:19:01.152 --> 01:19:04.281
- I'm making you an undercover agent.
- You can talk about anything.

01:19:04.364 --> 01:19:08.369
Shh, just listen. There are too many
people round here. It's not safe, okay?

01:19:08.451 --> 01:19:12.001
You make sure nobody follows me
because it's not safe.

01:19:12.080 --> 01:19:14.583
- D'you understand?
- Yeah.

01:19:14.666 --> 01:19:17.966
- Alright, good.
- Mo, Mo, Mo. Mo, will I get a badge?

01:19:18.044 --> 01:19:20.547
- Promise.
- Good man.

01:19:20.630 --> 01:19:23.679
Don't you worry, son. Don't you worry.
I've got your back.

01:19:23.758 --> 01:19:26.432
Vukovitch, Vukovitch, out, out, out!

01:19:33.559 --> 01:19:35.402
He's a copper, by the way.

01:19:35.478 --> 01:19:39.699
Fucker put me down. And I might have used
a bit more explosive than I planned.

01:19:39.774 --> 01:19:41.651
He's gonna need more than ten yards.

01:19:41.734 --> 01:19:44.783
Anything within a hundred yards
is gonna be dust.

01:19:47.991 --> 01:19:49.834
He won't be missed.

01:19:52.787 --> 01:19:56.587
I'm gonna get down to the ground.
Blend in with the plebs.

01:20:21.149 --> 01:20:23.618
Are you sure the Jihadis
won't get to Mojo?

01:20:23.693 --> 01:20:27.038
Don't you worry your pretty little head.

01:20:27.113 --> 01:20:29.741
One call to Taliban HQ
will get 'em out of the way.

01:20:29.824 --> 01:20:31.872
It's on.

01:20:34.954 --> 01:20:37.628
Everybody out, please! Go, go, go.

01:20:38.583 --> 01:20:40.585
- Yeah, are you with him?
- Yeah.

01:20:40.668 --> 01:20:43.797
He's a copper.
When he's at the mosque, take him out.

01:20:43.880 --> 01:20:45.803
The bomb will do the rest.

01:21:03.149 --> 01:21:04.446
Agh!

01:21:04.525 --> 01:21:06.448
Dad. Dad, move. Gun!

01:21:08.780 --> 01:21:12.284
Dad, just run. Go! Just run, run!

01:21:27.465 --> 01:21:29.559
Shit!

01:21:46.526 --> 01:21:48.620
Come on, come on...

01:21:52.949 --> 01:21:56.453
Allahu Akbar... Allahu Akbar...
Allahu Akbar...

01:22:12.218 --> 01:22:14.846
Where's the bomb?
Where's the fucking bomb?!

01:22:14.929 --> 01:22:16.806
It's out there!

01:22:16.889 --> 01:22:19.062
Hunt put some more in there,
just found out.

01:22:19.142 --> 01:22:21.861
Breathe, just fucking breathe.

01:22:21.936 --> 01:22:25.486
Now the only thing that matters
is that I keep my cover.

01:22:25.565 --> 01:22:28.318
You don't know the half of what I'm on to.

01:22:28.401 --> 01:22:30.324
Alright?

01:22:34.574 --> 01:22:36.668
Did you fucking sleep with her?

01:22:37.827 --> 01:22:39.921
Yeah.

01:22:42.790 --> 01:22:45.714
I don't expect
we'll be seeing you round here again.

01:22:55.094 --> 01:22:57.188
Shit. Where the fuck is it?

01:23:12.153 --> 01:23:14.326
Mohammed.

01:23:14.405 --> 01:23:16.499
Dad?

01:23:24.790 --> 01:23:28.090
- When did you set this timer for?
- Now.

01:23:28.169 --> 01:23:30.217
Now? This now?

01:23:30.296 --> 01:23:32.424
Well, nothing's fucking happening.

01:23:32.507 --> 01:23:34.976
You fucking...

01:23:35.051 --> 01:23:39.352
We are Shadwell,
the Kennel is our place...

01:24:08.251 --> 01:24:13.849
Come on, you dogs!

01:24:13.923 --> 01:24:17.518
Shadwell Army!

01:24:20.888 --> 01:24:23.186
Shadwell Army.

01:24:23.266 --> 01:24:25.860
Shadwell Army!

01:24:37.947 --> 01:24:41.542
Tensions in
London's East End area have erupted

01:24:41.617 --> 01:24:45.292
with a mystery explosion at the home
of Shadwell Town Football Club,

01:24:45.371 --> 01:24:48.124
with one fatality,
believed to be the bomber.

01:24:48.207 --> 01:24:52.007
Police relied on CCTV footage
to identify the suspect,

01:24:52.086 --> 01:24:56.557
one Garth Berry. Well known and respected
within his local community where

01:24:56.632 --> 01:24:58.475
he was best known as Gumbo.

01:24:58.551 --> 01:25:01.270
No other suspects
are believed to be involved.

01:25:01.345 --> 01:25:04.770
A police spokesman saying this
looked like a lone wolf protest

01:25:04.849 --> 01:25:07.318
against plans to develop
the Shadwell ground.

01:25:08.519 --> 01:25:11.523
So, Vukovitch decides
on the eve of a European semi

01:25:11.606 --> 01:25:13.904
that he's selling our team to the Saudis.

01:25:13.983 --> 01:25:15.030
Cheers, mate.

01:25:15.109 --> 01:25:18.158
There's not a lot I can say in the face
of that. Russians, Arabs,

01:25:18.237 --> 01:25:21.582
they're not like us, are they?
We have got to hang on to the true spirit

01:25:21.657 --> 01:25:24.376
of the Englishman
before we forget what that is.

01:25:24.452 --> 01:25:30.084
You know a true Englishman three ways.
By his attitude to drinking, food and sex.

01:25:30.166 --> 01:25:34.012
Apparently now chicken tikka masala
is our national dish.

01:25:34.086 --> 01:25:38.182
I mean, what happened to good old English
fish and chips, I hear you ask.

01:25:38.257 --> 01:25:41.056
Well, the chips idea
we imported from the French.

01:25:41.135 --> 01:25:43.263
And the fried fish we got from the Jews.

01:25:43.346 --> 01:25:45.940
So you see,
it never really was English at all.

01:25:46.015 --> 01:25:48.393
Now the vinegar, that was all ours.

01:25:48.476 --> 01:25:51.320
That's right. We added the sour bit.

01:25:51.395 --> 01:25:53.489
How English is that?

01:25:55.316 --> 01:25:57.739
I do miss me pie and mash shops, though.

01:25:57.818 --> 01:26:01.288
I mean down my road we've got curries,
kebabs, Italian, Halal.

01:26:01.364 --> 01:26:03.708
But I want me pie and mash and liquor.

01:26:03.783 --> 01:26:08.710
Sums up everything, that does, about a
true Englishman. Pie, mash and liquor.

01:26:08.788 --> 01:26:13.168
And right there you have the Englishman's
guide to Saturday night sex.

01:26:13.250 --> 01:26:17.847
You have five pints, Match Of The Day,
climb on top and you can't get it up.

01:26:19.048 --> 01:26:22.393
So it's pints, match and lick 'er.

01:26:23.844 --> 01:26:25.687
I'm Eddie. Be glad you're not.

01:26:30.226 --> 01:26:32.320
No, thanks, mate, I'm off it.

01:26:38.776 --> 01:26:41.029
What did I say to you?

01:26:41.112 --> 01:26:43.114
Eh?

01:26:43.197 --> 01:26:45.245
I said don't end up like John.

01:26:49.328 --> 01:26:51.422
Clymer tried to retire me.

01:26:52.415 --> 01:26:55.043
Can't get rid of me that easily.
Got promoted.

01:26:56.419 --> 01:26:58.296
Well, you might make a copper yet.

01:26:58.379 --> 01:27:01.007
Being reassigned. Extremism unit.

01:27:02.258 --> 01:27:06.183
I do fucking good police work.
I found that out the hard way.

01:27:06.262 --> 01:27:09.232
And as a man? How are you doing there?

01:27:12.059 --> 01:27:14.153
Still working on that one.

01:27:15.896 --> 01:27:17.990
Ain't we all.

01:27:18.774 --> 01:27:20.651
You'll be alright.

01:27:20.735 --> 01:27:22.783
Two out of three ain't bad.

01:27:23.821 --> 01:27:25.414
How d'you mean?

01:27:25.489 --> 01:27:28.993
You're a good copper. And a decent bloke.

01:27:30.578 --> 01:27:34.674
But I'll tell you something for nothing,
Mo, you ain't much of a Muslim.

01:27:35.791 --> 01:27:38.544
...where he was best known as Gumbo.

01:27:38.627 --> 01:27:41.130
No other suspects
are believed to be involved.

01:27:41.213 --> 01:27:43.307
Gumbo.

01:27:45.801 --> 01:27:48.304
Fucking love you, Gumbo.

01:27:54.477 --> 01:27:56.571
You're learning.

01:28:09.658 --> 01:28:11.706
I'm gonna miss you, mate.

01:28:15.080 --> 01:28:17.674
I'm gonna miss you,
you tubby little bastard.

01:28:17.750 --> 01:28:21.345
- Raise your drinks. Gumbo.
- Gumbo!

01:28:21.420 --> 01:28:24.640
Here y'are, Gumbo. Come on,
let's go and get a drink. Yeah?

01:28:25.424 --> 01:28:27.597
Yeah, fuck it. Celebrate.

01:28:30.638 --> 01:28:35.519
I do not condone or excuse
what happened at Shadwell.

01:28:36.852 --> 01:28:38.900
But I understand it.

01:28:39.980 --> 01:28:41.948
I understand the power

01:28:42.024 --> 01:28:43.947
and the depth of feeling

01:28:44.026 --> 01:28:45.949
that caused that to happen,

01:28:46.862 --> 01:28:50.958
because I feel the depth and power
of that feeling myself.

01:28:51.033 --> 01:28:53.127
And many people do.

01:28:53.994 --> 01:28:56.338
And it won't be the last time.
