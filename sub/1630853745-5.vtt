WEBVTT

00:04.713 --> 00:06.339
Shots, shots, shots.

00:06.381 --> 00:07.799
Woohoo!

00:09.884 --> 00:10.844
Where’s the bosun?

00:10.885 --> 00:12.387
[vomits]

00:13.346 --> 00:15.849
Nah... it’s alcohol.

00:15.890 --> 00:17.183
We gotta step it up.

00:18.059 --> 00:19.477
No.

00:19.519 --> 00:21.563
-You definitely are.
-You definitely are dating.

00:24.274 --> 00:26.651
Before we joined
Motor Yacht Home,

00:26.693 --> 00:30.280
Tasha and I made an agreement
when we get into a week,

00:30.321 --> 00:32.615
we can slowly let everyone
know we’re together.

00:32.657 --> 00:35.201
And now I feel like
she’s avoiding me.

00:35.243 --> 00:38.246
Just can’t handle
this pressure anymore.

00:42.542 --> 00:44.878
I get lost in her ----ing
Goddamn eyes.

00:44.919 --> 00:50.008
Storm’s got this rugged, hot
look to him, and I’m into it.

00:50.050 --> 00:51.509
I miss you.

00:57.140 --> 01:00.310
Tasha’s gonna drive me insane
for all the right reasons.

01:02.270 --> 01:04.189
Uh-uh, my asshole burns.

01:08.610 --> 01:11.112
Do they know to put
the toys out yet?

01:11.154 --> 01:12.864
Raygan, toys in the water.

01:12.906 --> 01:14.657
I’m a little irritated
with Raygan.

01:14.699 --> 01:18.620
You find excuses every time,
and that really upsets me.

01:20.455 --> 01:21.581
Three meters, getting close.

01:21.623 --> 01:23.166
Oh sh--,
that’s not three meters.

01:23.208 --> 01:24.417
-That is one meter.
-One meter.

01:24.459 --> 01:26.378
One meter...
she’s gonna hit it, man.

01:29.255 --> 01:30.882
You hit it!

01:30.924 --> 01:35.220
This docking was the straw
that broke the camel’s back.

01:36.638 --> 01:39.974
Raygan, Raygan,
come to the bridge.

01:40.016 --> 01:41.434
Have a seat.

01:56.199 --> 02:02.080
The first charter, I could see
the lack of experience on deck,

02:02.122 --> 02:03.415
even down with two people.

02:03.456 --> 02:06.334
Charter two, now you
got a full team.

02:06.376 --> 02:09.629
It was complete chaos
on that aft deck.

02:09.671 --> 02:12.298
I can tell you haven’t
run a deck crew

02:12.340 --> 02:14.676
in a busy charter boat,
on a vessel this size.

02:21.182 --> 02:24.310
Yeah, so, the final straw
was the docking.

02:24.352 --> 02:26.146
There was a point where
you called three meters,

02:26.187 --> 02:28.064
and I had less than
a half a meter.

02:28.106 --> 02:31.317
That can’t happen, Raygan.
It’s dangerous.

02:31.359 --> 02:34.988
It is our job to
lead a team, and manage.

02:35.030 --> 02:37.115
That is a big thing for me.

02:37.157 --> 02:39.617
So, I’m letting you go.

02:41.828 --> 02:44.664
If I had the time
and I wasn’t,

02:44.706 --> 02:48.752
you know, running a boat
this size, I would train you.

02:48.793 --> 02:50.086
I would teach you.

02:50.128 --> 02:53.506
My recommendation is to
work under a strong bosun.

02:53.548 --> 02:55.842
I’ll give you a
recommendation, busy charter...

02:55.884 --> 02:58.053
I need some busy charters
to actually learn more.

02:58.094 --> 03:03.141
Yeah, and I truly hope
that you pursue this career

03:03.183 --> 03:05.852
because I truly
want more women on deck

03:05.894 --> 03:07.645
and want more women
in the bridge.

03:07.687 --> 03:11.399
-Okay, thank you.
-Yeah.

03:11.441 --> 03:13.193
-Nice meeting you all.
-Yeah, you too.

03:13.234 --> 03:14.694
So, listen, don’t give up.

03:14.736 --> 03:16.279
No, I won’t give up, of course.

03:16.321 --> 03:18.865
Go on as a deckhand, under a
strong bosun, busy charter boat.

03:18.907 --> 03:20.116
-Okay, yeah.
-Okay.

03:20.158 --> 03:21.910
Okay, thank you.

03:28.249 --> 03:29.668
That was hard.

03:29.709 --> 03:32.837
I’m gonna need my luggage
from the forward.

03:36.257 --> 03:38.051
Storm, Storm, Tasha.

03:38.093 --> 03:40.512
<i>Please can you</i>
<i>get the suitcase</i>

03:40.553 --> 03:43.056
<i>out of the forepeak,</i>
<i>a blue one?</i>

03:43.098 --> 03:45.058
<i>Yeah, copy that.</i>

03:45.100 --> 03:48.770
-Are you all right?
-I can’t believe what happened.

03:48.812 --> 03:50.188
She’s sacked me.

03:50.230 --> 03:52.107
-Oh, why?
-Huh...

03:52.148 --> 03:56.945
Apparently, I’m not strong
enough for the deck.

03:56.986 --> 03:58.029
Oh [bleep] me.

03:58.071 --> 03:59.322
I’m so sorry, hon.

03:59.364 --> 04:01.074
I actually don’t
know what to say.

04:01.116 --> 04:03.743
Whew!

04:03.785 --> 04:05.078
It’s hot as sh-- in there.

04:05.120 --> 04:06.663
I’m so sorry.

04:06.705 --> 04:09.916
Like, this is not something,
like, that anyone wants.

04:09.958 --> 04:11.543
Here’s the bag...
why do you need the bag?

04:11.584 --> 04:13.628
Because I’ve been sacked.

04:13.670 --> 04:14.462
What?

04:14.504 --> 04:16.047
What are you talking about?

04:19.050 --> 04:20.427
Oh, babe, I’m so sorry.

04:22.512 --> 04:24.264
Apparently, I’m not
experienced enough.

04:24.305 --> 04:25.682
I’m sorry, babe.

04:25.724 --> 04:28.393
Is there anything else that
I can get for you?

04:28.435 --> 04:30.061
No, it’s okay,
just keep in touch.

04:30.103 --> 04:31.771
Oh.

04:31.813 --> 04:33.940
Yeah, I’ve got nothing
in the laundry.

04:33.982 --> 04:35.442
All right, babe.

04:35.483 --> 04:36.985
----ing hell.

04:40.280 --> 04:41.698
What?

04:54.002 --> 04:55.420
No, what happened?

04:55.462 --> 04:58.131
Raygan got let go, dude.

04:58.173 --> 04:59.966
Raygan did?

05:00.008 --> 05:01.676
Yeah.

05:01.718 --> 05:03.636
Yeah, sounds about right.

05:03.678 --> 05:05.180
I would have been shocked
if they were like,

05:05.221 --> 05:07.140
Raygan, you’re killing it.

05:07.182 --> 05:09.601
This hangover that you were
out a full day, loved it.

05:09.642 --> 05:12.645
We’re actually
gonna promote you.

05:12.687 --> 05:14.689
I really hope that they will
be able to find someone else

05:14.731 --> 05:15.982
in the next two days,

05:16.024 --> 05:18.151
because that means that
well have to do

05:18.193 --> 05:19.319
a charter with three guys.

05:19.361 --> 05:20.653
That’ll be pretty gnarly, dude.

05:20.695 --> 05:22.072
That’ll be quite intense.

05:22.113 --> 05:23.823
Come here.

05:23.865 --> 05:24.949
Just heard.

05:29.037 --> 05:30.330
That’s just sh--.

05:30.372 --> 05:33.124
Oh!

05:33.166 --> 05:34.501
Ooh, that’s heavy.

05:34.542 --> 05:38.046
-Bye!
-Raygan, take care of yourself.

05:38.088 --> 05:42.175
I feel, like, obviously,
sad to have to leave

05:42.217 --> 05:44.010
in these sort of circumstances.

05:44.052 --> 05:45.345
Sorry to see you go, babe.

05:45.387 --> 05:47.222
Thanks for everything.

05:47.263 --> 05:48.848
It’s a really bad feeling.

05:48.890 --> 05:50.850
Like, you feel like
you’ve not achieved

05:50.892 --> 05:52.519
what you were
supposed to achieve.

05:52.560 --> 05:55.772
But in the end I’m trying to
keep my head up, keep positive,

05:55.814 --> 05:58.900
and we’ll see what happens
in the future, yeah.

06:03.113 --> 06:05.198
I just feel so bad.

06:05.240 --> 06:06.783
I hate when people get fired.

06:06.825 --> 06:08.952
Yeah, you hate when someone
leaves, right, but it’s,

06:08.993 --> 06:11.037
like, we’re into
third charter now, you know?

06:11.079 --> 06:12.872
So, is it the team that’s weak
or is it the leader that’s weak?

06:12.914 --> 06:14.290
That’s the question
at the end of the day.

06:14.332 --> 06:16.376
I think there’s gonna
be challenges facing

06:16.418 --> 06:18.712
the exterior team and how
naturally they will function

06:18.753 --> 06:21.214
as opposed to how
we would in the interior...

06:21.256 --> 06:24.759
myself, Nat, Tash,
and Dave, the power team...

06:26.636 --> 06:27.595
Now get moving!

06:27.637 --> 06:28.680
I actually need to...

06:28.722 --> 06:29.889
It’s called doing your job.

06:29.931 --> 06:31.141
Well done, you’re a stewardess.

06:33.143 --> 06:34.602
That’s good.

06:34.644 --> 06:36.646
[bleep] we can always re-rinse.

06:36.688 --> 06:37.897
It’s just the soap
that’s a problem.

06:37.939 --> 06:40.233
Very nice.

06:40.275 --> 06:41.609
Ah, it’s still on.

06:41.651 --> 06:43.820
Oh, just pull it to,
just open it.

06:43.862 --> 06:45.613
It’s only got a
couple of things in there.

06:45.655 --> 06:48.283
Ow, just got burned in the eye.

06:48.324 --> 06:49.284
Huh?

06:49.325 --> 06:51.202
[bleep]

06:51.244 --> 06:52.412
What?

06:52.454 --> 06:54.873
Proper burning hot.

06:54.914 --> 06:58.293
Want some eye-wash?
Want some eye-wash?

06:58.335 --> 06:59.669
Good facial.

06:59.711 --> 07:01.171
Yeah, it was.

07:01.212 --> 07:02.881
Are you... do I need to get
something, cold towel?

07:02.922 --> 07:04.049
No, you’re all good.

07:04.090 --> 07:05.925
I’ll just quickly
nip to my cabin.

07:05.967 --> 07:07.135
Huh?

07:07.177 --> 07:08.511
You’re all good.

07:18.605 --> 07:19.564
-Tash?
-Yeah?

07:19.606 --> 07:20.940
Here you go.

07:20.982 --> 07:22.609
It’s all right,
it’s just a bit red.

07:22.650 --> 07:24.152
Here you go.

07:26.321 --> 07:28.156
No, I didn’t either.

07:30.700 --> 07:32.118
Just a bit longer.

07:32.160 --> 07:33.119
Just, like, one more minute.

07:33.161 --> 07:35.622
-Uh-huh.
-Just in case.

07:35.663 --> 07:40.293
When I first met Dave we had fun
together, we’d laugh together.

07:40.335 --> 07:45.632
Whereas now,
he’s always suffocating me.

07:45.674 --> 07:47.550
You counting to a minute?

07:47.592 --> 07:48.802
Mm-hmm.

07:48.843 --> 07:51.471
Will you just
leave me alone, go away.

07:51.513 --> 07:53.223
I know you’re,
like, pretty impatient.

07:55.308 --> 07:57.143
Well, I’ll leave you to it.

08:01.147 --> 08:02.524
Oh [bleep].

08:04.776 --> 08:08.863
Storm, Storm, can you
come to the bridge?

08:08.905 --> 08:10.281
Copy that.

08:13.368 --> 08:14.953
Does this make you happy?

08:14.994 --> 08:16.329
Yes.

08:16.371 --> 08:19.416
That I let you think you can
beat me in a position?

08:19.457 --> 08:21.876
I already have, that’s why
you’re wearing that badge.

08:23.545 --> 08:25.171
How you doing, Tash?

08:25.213 --> 08:26.548
I’m all right.

08:26.589 --> 08:28.258
Yes, Captain?

08:28.299 --> 08:31.845
Okay, so, obviously, I’m gonna
need a provisional bosun.

08:31.886 --> 08:34.848
Experience on lines and running
the deck is really important,

08:34.889 --> 08:36.016
because it can be dangerous.

08:36.057 --> 08:38.685
So, I feel like
I can trust you...

08:38.727 --> 08:40.520
-Sure.
-From what I’ve seen.

08:40.562 --> 08:44.441
So, if you’re willing,
I’d love to offer you that.

08:44.482 --> 08:45.775
I would love to take that.

08:45.817 --> 08:46.943
And then...
okay, awesome.

08:46.985 --> 08:48.403
It would be a...
that’s my...

08:48.445 --> 08:50.363
-it’s been my goal.
-Yeah, that’s great.

08:50.405 --> 08:51.656
There’s a lot for me to learn,
but I’m here to step up, so.

08:51.698 --> 08:52.824
Figure out your schedule...

08:52.866 --> 08:54.534
Yeah, in terms of,
like, structure,

08:54.576 --> 08:56.077
I’ve definitely got something
in my head planned.

08:56.119 --> 08:57.537
Yeah, okay.

08:57.579 --> 08:59.539
You know, it’s really difficult
to find a great bosun,

08:59.581 --> 09:01.041
but at the same time, you know,

09:01.082 --> 09:03.251
I saw a lot of
potential with Storm.

09:03.293 --> 09:04.377
Hook the jet-ski up.

09:04.419 --> 09:06.004
Help me place it, easy-peasy.

09:06.046 --> 09:07.547
He took command.

09:07.589 --> 09:08.965
We need to put our banisters in.

09:09.007 --> 09:10.884
We need to start flaking our
lines out, please.

09:10.925 --> 09:12.677
So, I wanna give him
that opportunity

09:12.719 --> 09:14.971
to show me that he
can be a bosun.

09:15.013 --> 09:17.891
You can be a hard worker, but
that doesn’t mean you can lead.

09:17.932 --> 09:20.935
I need to make sure that
Storm can lead a team.

09:20.977 --> 09:22.479
That’s why he’s provisional.

09:22.520 --> 09:23.897
All right, awesome.
Well, thank you.

09:23.938 --> 09:25.106
Thank you very much,
I appreciate that.

09:25.148 --> 09:26.733
Yep, okay.

09:26.775 --> 09:29.402
All right, we’ll just hit the
rest of this, and see you later.

09:29.444 --> 09:31.738
It’s just, like, the juicing
machine that we need to,

09:31.780 --> 09:34.240
like, put away and sh--
and then we’re good.

09:34.282 --> 09:35.950
They made me bosun.

09:35.992 --> 09:37.327
That’s epic, bro.

09:37.369 --> 09:39.496
Listen, overall,
I’m ----ing over the moon,

09:39.537 --> 09:41.414
but it’s terrifying.

09:41.456 --> 09:42.791
Just embrace it.

09:42.832 --> 09:43.917
You’ve got people
that have your back.

09:43.958 --> 09:46.252
-Like you, homie.
-Exactly.

09:46.294 --> 09:47.671
Thanks, boy.

09:47.712 --> 09:50.215
All crew, let’s meet in
the main salon now, please.

09:54.594 --> 09:56.680
[laughing]

10:03.353 --> 10:06.940
So, everybody knows
that I let Raygan go.

10:06.981 --> 10:08.942
It wasn’t an easy decision.

10:08.983 --> 10:11.945
It was really
gut-wrenching for me.

10:11.986 --> 10:17.992
But for now, Storm is stepping
in as a provisional bosun,

10:18.034 --> 10:21.496
and he’s gonna show
me what he’s got.

10:21.538 --> 10:22.664
[applause]

10:25.208 --> 10:27.752
It’s been a dream of mine
to obviously become a bosun.

10:27.794 --> 10:29.170
I feel quite emotional,

10:29.212 --> 10:31.131
because I’ve just been
working really hard.

10:31.172 --> 10:33.091
But what I’m gonna do is
just rely on my experience,

10:33.133 --> 10:35.427
just keep a calm head,
and just really show Sandy,

10:35.468 --> 10:37.262
you know, that she made
the right decision.

10:37.303 --> 10:39.180
And then our new deckhand
arrives

10:39.222 --> 10:41.057
the first day of charter,
so just have the cabin ready.

10:41.099 --> 10:42.934
Are we allowed
to know, for cabin arrangements,

10:42.976 --> 10:44.144
if it’s a male or female,

10:44.185 --> 10:46.104
because I was
sharing with Raygan.

10:46.146 --> 10:47.856
-It’s a woman.
-Okay.

10:47.897 --> 10:49.733
-Fantastic.
-Thank you so much.

10:49.774 --> 10:51.067
-Congrats, Storm!
-Okay, thank you.

10:51.109 --> 10:52.277
-Thanks, guys.
-Woo!

10:59.743 --> 11:01.119
Wow!

11:13.006 --> 11:14.841
With Tash,
I literally have no idea

11:14.883 --> 11:16.343
where I’m standing right now.

11:16.384 --> 11:17.844
She just runs away
from any approach

11:17.886 --> 11:19.554
that I have towards her.

11:19.596 --> 11:23.224
I’m scared to confront her
because I’m scared to lose her,

11:23.266 --> 11:25.477
and that’s the last thing
that I want right now.

11:37.697 --> 11:39.741
Coming up...

11:42.660 --> 11:45.580
I’ve kissed the most beautiful
woman in the world.

11:45.622 --> 11:47.457
And later...

11:47.499 --> 11:49.876
Hey, Dave, you okay?

11:59.386 --> 11:59.928
What’s up, homie?

12:00.679 --> 12:01.846
Hey, coz.

12:01.888 --> 12:03.723
Finally, I can
clean this fridge!

12:04.808 --> 12:06.142
Oh, God, come on.

12:08.561 --> 12:09.896
Boys, we can clock off.

12:09.938 --> 12:11.773
Let’s just wrap everything up,
wash the buckets.

12:11.815 --> 12:13.316
We need to get changed.

12:20.990 --> 12:22.617
Ah!

12:27.080 --> 12:28.707
Oh, flannel twinnies!

12:30.667 --> 12:32.836
Tash, you’re good, yeah?
You don’t need anything?

12:32.877 --> 12:34.421
-All good, thanks.
-All right.

12:36.631 --> 12:38.842
Excuse me, you’re in the way.
Let’s go, bye.

12:38.883 --> 12:40.802
-All right, I’m coming.
-Sorry, she looks beautiful.

12:40.844 --> 12:42.303
Just shut your ----ing mouth.

12:42.345 --> 12:43.638
Just because you’re
also beautiful.

12:43.680 --> 12:44.806
-Aw!
-And I’m not complimenting you.

12:44.848 --> 12:47.475
Where’s my shoes?

12:47.517 --> 12:49.978
I can tell something’s gonna
happen between me and Storm,

12:50.020 --> 12:51.604
but I just don’t know when.

12:51.646 --> 12:54.399
Lots of flirting, you know,
little comments here and there.

12:54.441 --> 12:57.444
So, you can’t putt
off the inetidi...

12:57.485 --> 12:58.903
oh, here we go...
inetidable...

12:58.945 --> 13:00.780
inetible...
inetidible...

13:00.822 --> 13:03.158
netable...
inevitable.

13:04.325 --> 13:06.703
I’m gonna flash the world.

13:06.745 --> 13:08.079
You good?

13:08.121 --> 13:10.999
-Are we doing girls and boys?
-Ah!

13:11.041 --> 13:13.460
My asshole!

13:13.501 --> 13:15.503
[laughing]

13:19.132 --> 13:21.009
-Darling!
-Hello, lovely!

13:21.051 --> 13:22.886
-Did you miss us?
-I missed her.

13:22.927 --> 13:24.095
Oh!

13:24.137 --> 13:25.263
All right,
how was your car ride?

13:25.305 --> 13:26.681
Who’s gonna sit next to me?

13:26.723 --> 13:28.725
Whoever’s gonna make me laugh
sit next to me.

13:28.767 --> 13:30.101
Hello, guys, how are you?

13:30.143 --> 13:32.228
Could I order four
espresso martinis?

13:32.270 --> 13:33.229
Wait, wait, wait...

13:33.271 --> 13:34.564
Dave, are you espresso martini?

13:34.606 --> 13:36.441
No, just a beer, please.

13:42.447 --> 13:43.740
Thank you.

13:48.453 --> 13:49.746
Yes.

13:54.918 --> 13:56.419
Boyfriend!

13:56.461 --> 13:58.129
Storm.

13:58.171 --> 13:59.756
No, have it.

14:14.938 --> 14:17.732
If anyone here or anybody
new joining the boat

14:17.774 --> 14:22.779
thinks they can get
between Tash, Chief, myself,

14:22.821 --> 14:25.448
second, and Nat, third,

14:25.490 --> 14:27.367
as a unit, you’re
highly mistaken.

14:27.409 --> 14:28.952
How are you guys feeling about
the new...

14:28.993 --> 14:31.371
-like, it’s interesting.
-She’s my roommate.

14:34.290 --> 14:36.710
We could share the same cabin.

14:36.751 --> 14:39.295
So, you would have to share
the same cabin with her.

14:39.337 --> 14:40.588
Maybe it’s your wife, mate.

14:40.630 --> 14:42.424
I mean, it could be
mine.

14:42.465 --> 14:45.218
Whoa!

15:16.833 --> 15:17.792
Oh [bleep] me.

15:17.834 --> 15:19.169
Guys, let’s go.

15:19.210 --> 15:21.463
The bill’s paid,
let’s ----ing get outta here.

15:22.380 --> 15:24.591
Look out, I’m coming in hot.

15:26.509 --> 15:28.178
Woo!

15:36.644 --> 15:38.271
I don’t know
what my flirting style is.

15:38.313 --> 15:39.689
I normally am the introvert

15:39.731 --> 15:41.733
when it comes to actually
initiating anything.

15:41.775 --> 15:44.152
I’ve got no problems talking,
but after that,

15:44.194 --> 15:45.487
I’m kinda, like,
fish outta water.

15:45.528 --> 15:47.364
Or I’m just a huge pussy.

15:49.199 --> 15:50.617
I’ve gotta get me a man.

15:58.708 --> 15:59.918
Yeah, let’s go.

16:03.046 --> 16:06.841
So, I know sometimes that when
I get into my work zone,

16:06.883 --> 16:09.010
whatever I can do,
I’m gonna do.

16:09.052 --> 16:10.178
It’s not all you.

16:10.220 --> 16:11.471
Yeah, of course.

16:11.513 --> 16:13.014
It’s not all you
to do everything.

16:13.056 --> 16:14.474
Stop saying "I, I, I."

16:14.516 --> 16:15.684
Give other people
the opportunity to...

16:15.725 --> 16:17.060
Yeah, I agree, I agree,
I appreciate it.

16:17.102 --> 16:18.561
and I promise you,
that’s gonna make you...

16:18.603 --> 16:20.563
-I appreciate it.
-A ----ing great bosun.

16:20.605 --> 16:22.649
Don’t make it about yourself
doing everything.

16:22.691 --> 16:23.858
I appreciate it.

16:23.900 --> 16:26.486
Storm’s feeling pressure
is fairly normal,

16:26.528 --> 16:28.613
just because he’s never been
in that position before,

16:28.655 --> 16:30.156
and I can 100 percent relate.

16:30.198 --> 16:32.283
Last season I was feeling
all kinds of pressure

16:32.325 --> 16:33.868
just by stepping on board.

16:33.910 --> 16:36.788
-Is this your first boat, or...
-First big boat.

16:36.830 --> 16:38.873
-Under...
-Yeah.

16:38.915 --> 16:40.041
-Over...
-Over.

16:40.083 --> 16:41.042
And back through.

16:41.084 --> 16:42.252
Can I release it?

16:42.293 --> 16:43.586
No.

16:43.628 --> 16:44.879
This might have a safety lock...
there ya go.

16:44.921 --> 16:45.880
Whew!

16:45.922 --> 16:47.882
[laughing]

16:49.843 --> 16:52.220
Um... getting there.

16:52.262 --> 16:55.223
-I’m here to support you.
-I’m here to support you, man.

16:55.265 --> 16:56.391
All right.

16:56.433 --> 16:57.809
Love you.

16:57.851 --> 16:59.310
Love you too, bro.

16:59.352 --> 17:00.645
All right.

17:12.949 --> 17:14.534
-Tash!
-Yeah?

17:22.125 --> 17:24.961
-You don’t?
-I don’t.

17:25.003 --> 17:26.921
Talk to me in here.

17:35.138 --> 17:36.431
You literally can’t.

17:44.647 --> 17:46.608
I asked you about it...

17:46.649 --> 17:49.319
-Some days, I...
-I asked you about it.

18:15.929 --> 18:18.390
But you... Tash.

18:18.431 --> 18:20.016
Tash.

18:39.536 --> 18:41.413
They’re not beefing.

18:44.541 --> 18:45.792
Have you seen Tash?

18:47.043 --> 18:49.462
I don’t want a
relationship with Dave.

18:49.504 --> 18:51.798
The fact of us sharing a cabin,

18:51.840 --> 18:55.593
living together,
I don’t know, it’s just...

19:45.852 --> 19:46.478
Oh, I’m gonna kiss him.

19:47.354 --> 19:49.439
Okay, go.

19:49.481 --> 19:51.232
No!

20:09.000 --> 20:11.753
Let’s go, let’s go, let’s go.

20:11.795 --> 20:14.881
-That’s gonna exhaust me.
-Okay, this one.

20:19.844 --> 20:21.680
What’s up?

20:21.721 --> 20:23.473
You’re tired, yeah?

20:23.515 --> 20:25.475
That moustache... what secrets
is it hiding up here?

20:25.517 --> 20:27.602
It’s all the secrets
in the world.

20:27.644 --> 20:30.522
How am I supposed to know if
your moustache-fishing me?

20:30.563 --> 20:32.273
Well...

20:32.315 --> 20:33.983
It’s the secret.

20:42.909 --> 20:44.953
I had a ----ing great day.

20:44.994 --> 20:46.538
I got a tip,
those charter guests

20:46.579 --> 20:48.289
got the [bleep] off that boat,

20:48.331 --> 20:52.043
and I kissed the most beautiful
woman in the world, so...

20:53.712 --> 20:54.963
And a promotion!

20:55.005 --> 20:55.964
I didn’t even think
about that...

20:56.006 --> 20:57.465
you see what I’m saying?

20:57.507 --> 20:59.050
Like, that’s four.

21:04.055 --> 21:06.057
Dave?

21:06.099 --> 21:08.059
I’m just gonna queef
in his face.

21:13.314 --> 21:14.899
[chatters]

21:14.941 --> 21:16.359
Where’s Tash?

21:16.401 --> 21:19.237
Can I be honest... you
look like a ----ing wreck.

21:19.279 --> 21:20.238
Huh?

21:20.280 --> 21:24.200
Don’t know.
I’m over it, so.

21:24.242 --> 21:26.828
I’ve just been saving her
rotten secret the whole time.

21:28.079 --> 21:29.247
What’s going on?

21:34.419 --> 21:35.503
[phone rings]

21:41.051 --> 21:42.427
I’m not an apple!

21:49.517 --> 21:50.477
Going to bed.

22:00.653 --> 22:01.946
Tash.

22:06.076 --> 22:08.745
Dave and I hooked up
on my last boat.

22:08.787 --> 22:10.205
[gasps]
[bleep] I knew it.

22:10.246 --> 22:13.500
And now I’m getting
these messages from him.

22:16.127 --> 22:19.756
"Good luck [bleep] you," "Slut,"
"Thanks [bleep] you."

22:19.798 --> 22:24.052
To hook up with someone, you
kinda have a level of trust.

22:24.094 --> 22:28.598
And for him to send messages
calling me

22:28.640 --> 22:30.600
every name under the sun,

22:30.642 --> 22:33.728
you wouldn’t even treat your
own worst enemy like this.

22:33.770 --> 22:35.397
Goodbye, rotten secret.

22:36.481 --> 22:37.399
[sighs]

22:48.243 --> 22:49.452
[giggles]

23:01.673 --> 23:04.551
Honestly, I’m not taken back,

23:04.592 --> 23:07.345
because I see the type
of person that Dave is.

23:07.387 --> 23:09.931
This is the second time
it’s arising.

23:09.973 --> 23:11.683
You think you’re full,
but you’re not.

23:11.725 --> 23:14.185
Back it up.

23:14.227 --> 23:16.146
I’ll go to my room.

23:16.187 --> 23:18.648
-Hang on, one second.
-No, don’t touch me.

23:18.690 --> 23:19.816
I’ll go to my bed.

23:19.858 --> 23:21.484
What happened?

23:24.529 --> 23:27.615
Tasha?

23:27.657 --> 23:30.160
He’s caused so much damage
with his behavior,

23:30.201 --> 23:31.578
and now you can’t
take that back.

23:33.038 --> 23:34.831
Oh [bleep].

23:34.873 --> 23:37.334
No, come...
no, come in.

23:37.375 --> 23:38.710
There’s nothing happening, look.

23:38.752 --> 23:40.211
We have pants on.

23:40.253 --> 23:42.422
Can you guys just not
----ing have sex right now,

23:42.464 --> 23:44.299
while I’m here?

23:58.063 --> 23:59.981
I don’t know, here or up.

24:04.027 --> 24:07.530
Hey...
oh, there you are, mate.

24:07.572 --> 24:08.490
Are you all right?

24:10.241 --> 24:12.077
Why?

24:17.582 --> 24:19.042
What’d she do?

24:22.212 --> 24:23.713
Well, I know I put
and one and two together.

24:23.755 --> 24:25.382
Yeah.

24:37.477 --> 24:39.020
Sure.

24:42.982 --> 24:44.526
Yeah, facts, man.

24:47.779 --> 24:50.073
So [bleep] her.

24:53.535 --> 24:56.037
It’s been fine this
whole last six weeks.

24:56.079 --> 24:57.080
Yeah.

24:57.122 --> 24:59.666
[bleep] me and lying.

25:05.922 --> 25:07.298
Okay.

25:19.769 --> 25:21.271
What’s happening?

25:47.339 --> 25:49.424
I’m literally exhausted.

26:03.146 --> 26:04.689
I’ve gotta go.

26:09.861 --> 26:11.488
[bleep]

26:20.705 --> 26:22.457
What the [bleep]?

26:33.635 --> 26:35.136
I don’t remember what
happened last night,

26:35.178 --> 26:38.181
but I know I ----ed up here.

26:38.223 --> 26:40.350
I’m, like, what the [bleep]
are you doing?

26:42.394 --> 26:46.147
What I said to her over drunken
texts

26:46.189 --> 26:49.693
is just unforgiveable.

26:49.734 --> 26:52.320
The fact that I don’t
remember it

26:52.362 --> 26:56.032
or the fact that was exhausted,
none of that matters.

26:56.074 --> 26:57.492
You don’t talk
to people like that,

27:25.687 --> 27:26.396
When does the newbie arrive?

27:27.939 --> 27:30.275
I don’t know, I’ll find out
for you, though.

27:30.316 --> 27:32.444
I declare the cabin ready.

27:32.485 --> 27:33.653
-Oh.
-Unless...

27:33.695 --> 27:36.322
are you moving in?
Rawr!

27:36.364 --> 27:39.075
Taking Storm and my
relationship day by day.

27:39.117 --> 27:42.620
I don’t know if it’s
just this boat, small romance,

27:42.662 --> 27:44.497
or if it’s blossoming
to something else.

27:44.539 --> 27:45.957
I don’t know what’s happening.

27:45.999 --> 27:47.292
Maybe I’m the one who’s
gonna get attached.

27:47.334 --> 27:49.377
[chatters]

27:49.419 --> 27:50.587
By the way, guys,
nothing went down.

27:50.628 --> 27:51.796
We slept on top of the covers.

27:51.838 --> 27:53.506
-Hey?
-By the way, don’t care.

27:53.548 --> 27:59.137
I actually am pro,
uh, that, so, go for it.

28:05.560 --> 28:07.395
-But the good news...
-Hey, good morning.

28:07.437 --> 28:08.813
-Good morning.
-How are you?

28:08.855 --> 28:10.732
-Would you like some coffee?
-No, I’m good.

28:10.774 --> 28:12.192
-You sure?
-I’ve gotta go.

28:12.233 --> 28:13.401
Okay.

28:22.702 --> 28:24.079
Hey, good morning, sweetie.

28:25.997 --> 28:27.290
How are you?

28:27.332 --> 28:29.501
I need endless amounts of
water and coffee today.

28:32.295 --> 28:34.422
[bleep]

28:48.395 --> 28:50.230
[laughing]

28:50.271 --> 28:51.731
Just grab some chamois,

28:51.773 --> 28:53.858
let’s just hit all the
railings before lunch.

28:55.443 --> 28:56.945
The windows are gonna get
wet again

28:56.986 --> 28:58.363
because we’re gonna have
to hit the floor,

28:58.405 --> 28:59.739
just the bottom part.

28:59.781 --> 29:01.825
So, maybe don’t do
that too much right now.

29:01.866 --> 29:02.909
All right.

29:02.951 --> 29:04.703
Because this is
where the guests are.

29:04.744 --> 29:07.997
There’s, like, sun lotion
and alcohol, and...

29:08.039 --> 29:11.876
-Yeah, good vibes.
-Yeah, not bad vibes.

29:11.918 --> 29:12.877
I think Storm will
do better than Raygan.

29:12.919 --> 29:14.504
There will be a lot more order,

29:14.546 --> 29:17.090
a lot more people knowing
what they’re gonna be doing.

29:17.132 --> 29:19.801
I expect him to act like
a ----ing bosun.

29:19.843 --> 29:22.929
Hopefully the weather’s
not sh-- so we’ll just have

29:22.971 --> 29:25.056
to do the standard,
like, wipe-down and sh--.

29:26.224 --> 29:27.809
Aloha.

29:27.851 --> 29:30.729
I would have literally punched
him in the face last night.

29:30.770 --> 29:32.063
Now you probably understand,
like, why...

29:32.105 --> 29:33.189
Yeah.

29:33.231 --> 29:34.649
I didn’t feel
comfortable in the...

29:34.691 --> 29:36.109
-Yeah, it’s just...
-drunken state.

29:36.151 --> 29:37.736
But at the same time,

29:37.777 --> 29:42.282
I’m the one that’s
obviously brought this on.

29:42.323 --> 29:45.285
It takes two to tango.

29:45.326 --> 29:47.454
Life happens, people do sh--
that they, like, regret.

29:47.495 --> 29:49.122
Yeah.

29:49.164 --> 29:51.207
But no matter what you guys have
done in the past, in the end,

29:51.249 --> 29:52.417
it doesn’t give anyone
a right to talk to someone

29:52.459 --> 29:55.045
the way you just got spoken to.

29:55.086 --> 29:57.797
Anyway, I’m sorry for
the disruption it’s caused,

29:57.839 --> 30:02.677
-because it’s sh-- .
-No seriously, life is life.

30:02.719 --> 30:05.180
Do you know what,
everything happens for a reason.

30:07.682 --> 30:09.976
Just disappear to the
laundry and the cabins,

30:10.018 --> 30:11.478
because you’re ----ing amazing.

30:11.519 --> 30:12.687
I’m literally disappearing
to the laundry for now.

30:12.729 --> 30:14.814
Too fast for our own good.

30:14.856 --> 30:15.940
Chin up.

30:19.819 --> 30:22.030
Oh, yeah, who’s ready to work?

30:23.656 --> 30:26.242
I literally have the
itchiest titty right now.

30:26.284 --> 30:28.661
That’s the first
signs of gonorrhea.

30:28.703 --> 30:31.998
You’re such a sh--.

30:32.040 --> 30:37.295
Tomorrow, when we leave, Sandy
is gonna go through V2 and V1.

30:37.337 --> 30:38.838
-You see them?
-Yeah.

30:38.880 --> 30:42.258
I’m gonna ask if you can be
with me on the stern.

30:42.300 --> 30:43.802
It’s a dream of mine
to be a bosun.

30:43.843 --> 30:45.428
I’m definitely nervous.

30:45.470 --> 30:47.347
I’m very aware that
there’s loads of things

30:47.389 --> 30:48.973
that I still need to learn.

30:49.015 --> 30:52.227
But I’ve spent the past several
years on expedition boats,

30:52.268 --> 30:54.187
sailing boats, catamarans,

30:54.229 --> 30:58.191
which has shaped me to be who
I am right now as a leader.

30:58.233 --> 31:02.612
So, even though I feel this is
a really big mountain to climb,

31:02.654 --> 31:05.907
like, I’ve got the right set of
boots on, you know what I mean?

31:09.077 --> 31:10.995
What’s one thing about
a partner, like,

31:11.037 --> 31:13.123
if you guys are to move
in together,

31:13.164 --> 31:16.042
that if he does this, that would
send you over the edge?

31:16.084 --> 31:19.295
You go first,
I’m too hungover to think.

31:19.337 --> 31:22.340
Mine would be you know when
they do this thing

31:22.382 --> 31:23.341
when they...
[clears throat]

31:23.383 --> 31:24.551
Oh!

31:24.592 --> 31:26.011
And you spit.

31:26.052 --> 31:27.679
At that point, whilst
you’re in the shower,

31:27.721 --> 31:29.514
I’ve called a U-Haul already.

31:29.556 --> 31:31.057
The relationship
that I had prior

31:31.099 --> 31:32.767
to coming out was 12 years.

31:32.809 --> 31:34.894
It was challenging for me,

31:34.936 --> 31:37.188
you know, because my whole
life was a secret.

31:37.230 --> 31:41.401
And for him to have left me
for a woman was also tough.

31:41.443 --> 31:44.738
But through all of that
bullsh--

31:44.779 --> 31:47.615
I can literally grew out.

31:51.077 --> 31:52.912
Eww, a skid mark on the toilet.

31:52.954 --> 31:55.331
That’s a good one.

31:55.373 --> 31:57.709
Enjoy being single now,
that’s what I would say.

31:57.751 --> 31:59.085
Yeah.

31:59.127 --> 32:00.420
All right, I’m gonna write
some menus.

32:00.462 --> 32:01.629
That’s all I’m going to do.

32:07.135 --> 32:09.929
I’m just gonna smack you
on your asshole.

32:09.971 --> 32:13.058
That better be... you sh--head,
it’s so wet!

32:18.021 --> 32:18.980
[sighs]

32:42.837 --> 32:44.923
[sobbing]

32:50.261 --> 32:52.639
-Dave?
-Yeah?

32:52.681 --> 32:54.307
What is it, love?

32:54.349 --> 32:56.643
Just having a bit of,
like, an anxiety attack.

32:56.685 --> 32:57.811
Oh, God.

33:02.190 --> 33:03.149
[sobbing]

33:09.739 --> 33:11.074
-Captain?
-Yes?

33:11.116 --> 33:12.242
Do you mind coming
to have a look

33:12.283 --> 33:14.369
on Dave down in
the crew quarters?

33:14.411 --> 33:16.287
Is he okay?

33:16.329 --> 33:19.207
It seems like he’s having a bit
of a very deep emotional time.

33:19.249 --> 33:21.042
It will just help
if you come have a word.

33:21.084 --> 33:22.168
Okay.

33:29.843 --> 33:31.219
[sobbing]

33:32.762 --> 33:35.724
Hey, Dave, you okay?

33:41.688 --> 33:43.356
Hey.

33:44.566 --> 33:47.193
Just breathe.

33:47.235 --> 33:49.696
My mind is literally
out of control.

34:00.582 --> 34:03.251
[sobbing]

34:04.711 --> 34:07.297
Hey, Dave, you okay?

34:09.049 --> 34:10.967
Just breathe.

34:11.009 --> 34:13.011
My mind is literally
out of control.

34:13.053 --> 34:14.763
I’m sorry.

34:14.804 --> 34:17.974
Just concentrate on your breath,
because that’s gonna calm you.

34:18.016 --> 34:19.809
I haven’t been
like this for years.

34:19.851 --> 34:21.811
I thought I had it
under control.

34:21.853 --> 34:23.271
No, that’s okay.

34:23.313 --> 34:26.107
But there’s things that
make it surface, right?

34:26.149 --> 34:30.945
So, lack of sleep,
intense work environment.

34:32.655 --> 34:34.032
Okay, that’s why breathing...

34:34.074 --> 34:36.493
I can’t...
I literally can’t stop thinking.

34:38.328 --> 34:40.455
I can’t sleep, because
I can’t switch it off.

34:40.497 --> 34:44.334
So, why don’t we go do something
that stops the thinking,

34:44.376 --> 34:47.629
and just go for a walk
and look at the water, okay?

34:47.671 --> 34:48.838
Let’s do that.

34:48.880 --> 34:50.173
You can’t make this sh-- up.

34:50.215 --> 34:51.633
Dave’s in there, crying,
on the ground.

34:51.675 --> 34:53.093
Sandy’s in there.

34:53.134 --> 34:55.595
I was like, what the [bleep]
going on back there?

34:55.637 --> 34:56.554
Let’s go this way.

35:00.392 --> 35:02.227
[bleep] dude.

35:02.268 --> 35:05.855
I think it’s just emotions
between them from previous...

35:05.897 --> 35:07.357
That’s ----ed.

35:07.399 --> 35:09.275
All right, this isn’t all
the master stuff, is it?

35:09.317 --> 35:11.194
Yes.

35:11.236 --> 35:13.530
So, talk to me,
what’s going on?

35:13.571 --> 35:15.865
I’m ashamed of myself,
that’s all.

35:15.907 --> 35:17.492
You’re a human being.

35:17.534 --> 35:20.578
I sent some pretty sh--ty
messages to Tash last night.

35:20.620 --> 35:21.996
It’s not nice.

35:22.872 --> 35:24.582
Just hard on myself.

35:26.960 --> 35:28.712
What did you say to her?

35:28.753 --> 35:30.714
I was mean to her, I shouldn’t
have been mean to her.

35:30.755 --> 35:33.883
Just laundry-wise, there’s
a pile of napkins

35:33.925 --> 35:36.886
that’s really been niggling
at Natalya in the laundry.

35:36.928 --> 35:38.263
What if you change cabins?

35:38.304 --> 35:40.098
-It might help, yeah.
-Yeah.

35:40.140 --> 35:42.183
-Are you good?
-Okay.

35:42.225 --> 35:43.643
I’m gonna go talk to her.

35:43.685 --> 35:45.020
Thank you so much.

35:45.061 --> 35:46.563
You want me to leave you here?

35:46.604 --> 35:48.398
You wanna lay here?

35:48.440 --> 35:49.858
Yeah, of course.

35:49.899 --> 35:54.195
I’m not sure what happened
between Natasha and David,

35:54.237 --> 35:56.072
but as a captain,
I have an obligation.

35:56.114 --> 35:58.199
I have to make sure
that Tasha feels safe.

35:58.241 --> 36:00.243
That’s really more
important than anything.

36:00.285 --> 36:03.038
<i>Natasha, can you please</i>
<i>come to the bridge?</i>

36:05.331 --> 36:06.666
How’s it going, boys?

36:06.708 --> 36:08.376
Looks wonderful.

36:08.418 --> 36:10.253
We’ll give it a Hoover in the
morning before the guests come,

36:10.295 --> 36:11.629
just ’cause of all the
crew that’s walking on it,

36:11.671 --> 36:13.131
-in and out.
-Yeah.

36:13.173 --> 36:16.301
And then I reckon we are good
to go, baby, good to go.

36:18.094 --> 36:19.471
Hey, let’s have a seat.

36:21.973 --> 36:23.433
So, I don’t know
the whole story,

36:23.475 --> 36:26.227
I just know there were
text messages or something.

36:26.269 --> 36:27.729
They were not very nice,

36:27.771 --> 36:33.276
but I feel like I caused
this mess to start with.

36:33.318 --> 36:34.569
It’s not your fault.

36:34.611 --> 36:36.029
This is not...

36:36.071 --> 36:39.532
you know what, people make
their own decisions, right?

36:39.574 --> 36:45.163
The situation was that
I’ve just come out of,

36:45.205 --> 36:47.916
like, a five-year relationship.

36:47.957 --> 36:51.294
Then Dave and I had a thing...

36:55.048 --> 36:58.635
then I...

36:58.677 --> 37:02.472
basically didn’t want anything
else to happen.

37:02.514 --> 37:07.811
And there’s been
some upsetting

37:07.852 --> 37:09.270
things that he said to me.

37:09.312 --> 37:11.106
Do you feel safe?

37:11.147 --> 37:13.149
Yeah, I feel...

37:13.191 --> 37:15.151
I feel better, to be honest.

37:15.193 --> 37:16.986
I just hope that this
whole situation

37:17.028 --> 37:21.658
has not got too out-of-hand
that one of us would have to go.

37:21.700 --> 37:25.745
Because I feel like
we can move on from it.

37:25.787 --> 37:29.457
You know, I have to trust
you and your judgment,

37:31.459 --> 37:33.503
and we’ll go from there.

37:33.545 --> 37:35.338
But someone needs to move
out of the cabin.

37:35.380 --> 37:38.675
-Yeah.
-That’s gotta happen today.

37:38.717 --> 37:41.970
I’m not going to tell Captain
Sandy about the messages,

37:42.012 --> 37:44.764
because Dave is a lovely person.

37:44.806 --> 37:46.766
He’s got a kind heart,
he’s caring.

37:46.808 --> 37:49.602
But I also want her to
have a peace of mind

37:49.644 --> 37:51.980
that we can continue
to work together

37:52.022 --> 37:55.692
and carry on in a professional
working relationship.

37:55.734 --> 38:00.655
So, I think it’s best
just to not say anything.

38:00.697 --> 38:05.994
If you’re happy to let us
carry on working together,

38:06.036 --> 38:09.706
I’m not going to let it affect
my job, so, don’t feel like...

38:09.748 --> 38:11.207
Oh, yeah, no, I don’t feel
that way, not at all.

38:11.249 --> 38:12.876
I don’t feel like...

38:12.917 --> 38:14.377
Don’t worry, you don’t even
have to explain that part,

38:14.419 --> 38:15.378
because I already know that.

38:15.420 --> 38:17.172
-Okay.
-Okay?

38:17.213 --> 38:19.841
-Thanks.
-All right.

38:19.883 --> 38:22.510
I’m not concerned
that the chief stew

38:22.552 --> 38:23.845
and chef had a relationship.

38:23.887 --> 38:25.221
It’s none of my business.

38:25.263 --> 38:27.057
What I care about is
their mental health,

38:27.098 --> 38:30.727
their wellbeing, and I have to
get through this charter season.

38:32.270 --> 38:34.397
You know, we all end up on
this boat together,

38:34.439 --> 38:36.983
and for some people, maybe
they’re running from something.

38:37.025 --> 38:39.569
And for others, maybe they’re
looking for something.

38:39.611 --> 38:41.363
I want them to know they
have the support,

38:41.404 --> 38:43.531
but at the same time,
I’m the captain

38:43.573 --> 38:46.785
and I’m here to do a job, and
I expect them to do their job.

38:50.163 --> 38:54.876
Can I just have a hug...
aw.

38:54.918 --> 38:57.587
-What are you doing?
-I’m making a schedule.

38:57.629 --> 38:58.797
When’s your new girl coming?

38:58.838 --> 39:00.256
Tomorrow.

39:00.298 --> 39:02.592
How am I supposed to make
a schedule for someone

39:02.634 --> 39:04.594
that I don’t know
what their name is?

39:04.636 --> 39:06.096
This is my first time
as a bosun,

39:06.137 --> 39:09.766
so I just really
want someone who’s...

39:09.808 --> 39:12.018
Swear to God, if this
new chick arrives

39:12.060 --> 39:15.855
and I see her all up on my man,
she’s got another thing coming.

39:15.897 --> 39:17.273
With all of the boat drama,

39:17.315 --> 39:19.609
it’s important to have
someone

39:19.651 --> 39:21.236
who is passionate
about what they do.

39:21.277 --> 39:23.279
And then just overall,
like, just a good vibe,

39:23.321 --> 39:25.240
because we need
to gel as a team.

39:25.281 --> 39:28.576
Keep your little dirty eye
and moustache

39:28.618 --> 39:30.537
where I can see them at all
times when she arrives.

39:30.578 --> 39:33.873
[laughing]

39:33.915 --> 39:36.584
Dave, Dave, Sandy,
meet me in the bridge.

39:37.836 --> 39:38.753
On my way.

39:41.339 --> 39:43.508
I feel like
I’ve created this mess.

39:58.481 --> 39:59.524
Have a seat.

40:02.485 --> 40:06.698
Natasha and I had
a conversation, and...

40:06.740 --> 40:10.535
so, this is not okay.

40:10.577 --> 40:12.037
This is unacceptable on board,

40:12.078 --> 40:16.958
and I need to know
that everybody’s safe.

40:17.000 --> 40:21.421
I was, like...
I was out of line, you know?

40:21.463 --> 40:23.715
There was no excuses for that.

40:23.757 --> 40:26.092
Please give me another chance.

40:28.928 --> 40:32.974
If you do it again,
you’re fired, okay?

40:33.016 --> 40:34.559
So, do you think you can
get through this season?

40:34.601 --> 40:38.146
Yeah. Yeah.

40:38.188 --> 40:39.939
We can reset, you think?

40:39.981 --> 40:41.566
You think you could
do that and move on?

40:41.608 --> 40:43.109
-Yeah.
-Okay.

40:43.151 --> 40:44.944
-Yeah, definitely.
-All right.

40:44.986 --> 40:47.113
Okay. So, I want you guys
to move cabins now.

40:47.155 --> 40:47.989
Yeah.

40:48.031 --> 40:49.199
That’s gotta happen today.

40:49.240 --> 40:50.450
No, 100 percent.

40:50.492 --> 40:52.494
-All right.
-All right.

40:53.328 --> 40:55.038
I’m sorry.

40:55.080 --> 40:58.917
As far as interpersonal
relationships on board,

40:58.958 --> 41:01.795
each crewmember has to
draw their own line.

41:01.836 --> 41:05.674
And if Natasha said that she
felt threatened by David,

41:05.715 --> 41:07.133
then I would have let him go.

41:07.175 --> 41:08.510
Thank you for your time.

41:10.261 --> 41:13.306
I’ve been in a controlling
relationship before.

41:13.348 --> 41:15.225
It’s not nice.

41:15.266 --> 41:16.810
And what I saw last night

41:16.851 --> 41:19.521
was like I was being
owned by someone.

41:19.562 --> 41:21.481
That is actually not true.

41:21.523 --> 41:22.941
Like, I’m not in
any relationship.

41:22.982 --> 41:25.985
At the same time,
Dave doesn’t deserve

41:26.027 --> 41:27.779
to be made out to be
a bad person...

41:27.821 --> 41:29.698
-Mm-hmm.
-because he was just drunk.

41:29.739 --> 41:32.033
I just don’t know what
to say to him today.

41:32.075 --> 41:33.118
Mm-hmm.

41:33.159 --> 41:35.078
One thing that
he must understand...

41:35.120 --> 41:37.163
Dave, nothing can happen
with me and you now.

41:37.205 --> 41:39.165
I’m really hoping the best
for you and stuff,

41:39.207 --> 41:40.834
but I really need
to work on myself right now.

41:40.875 --> 41:42.460
No, it’s true.

41:42.502 --> 41:43.795
-I’m here, hey?
-I love you.

41:43.837 --> 41:45.088
I love you more
than you can think.

41:45.130 --> 41:47.465
Oh, you’re
the most amazing friend.

41:47.507 --> 41:49.175
Thank you for being there.

41:50.343 --> 41:52.137
Are we gonna move on soon?

41:52.178 --> 41:55.974
We’ve gotta sort the laz out,
then we’re gonna polish, baby.

41:56.016 --> 41:59.686
And I want you to know
Steven, he’s always around.

42:01.730 --> 42:04.649
When’s the new girl arriving?

42:04.691 --> 42:08.028
I’m ready to see
some fresh faces.

42:17.912 --> 42:20.081
I feel like I’ve betrayed you.

42:21.166 --> 42:22.667
I feel like...

42:25.879 --> 42:27.255
I just ----ed up and, like...

42:29.758 --> 42:31.843
Everyone knows you’re
a good person, Dave.

42:31.885 --> 42:35.055
It’s just being ashamed
of this whole situation.

42:35.096 --> 42:37.307
Like, it should never
have got to this,

42:37.349 --> 42:40.018
and I’m sorry that
I’ve made you feel

42:40.060 --> 42:43.355
like you’ve gotta hide stuff,
because it’s not right.

42:43.396 --> 42:45.690
Do you feel like
you can carry on

42:45.732 --> 42:47.567
and continue to work
with me professionally

42:47.609 --> 42:50.695
and continue doing
what you do best?

43:01.289 --> 43:04.876
I’ve never seen
Dave act this way.

43:04.918 --> 43:06.002
I don’t know this person.

43:06.044 --> 43:07.504
I don’t recognize him.

43:07.545 --> 43:10.882
And hopefully, he’ll never
do this ever again.

43:17.806 --> 43:20.141
Next, on "Below Deck Med"...

43:26.439 --> 43:28.942
He is not single.

43:28.983 --> 43:30.777
Kyle!

43:30.819 --> 43:33.113
Christina and Dina
are requesting

43:33.154 --> 43:34.572
a dual birthday celebration.

43:34.614 --> 43:36.950
How comfortable are we
with, like, semi-nude men?

43:36.991 --> 43:38.618
-Extremely.
-Very comfortable.

43:38.660 --> 43:41.329
-Are we very?
-Woo!

43:41.371 --> 43:44.082
Yeah!

43:57.303 --> 43:59.139
I don’t know what the
right thing to do is.

44:02.434 --> 44:04.644
Six meters off stern.

44:04.686 --> 44:05.979
I don’t hear Storm.

44:06.021 --> 44:07.939
Three meters to V4 off stern.

44:07.981 --> 44:08.982
Press the mic and then talk.

44:09.024 --> 44:11.276
Ugh, we’re gonna hit!
