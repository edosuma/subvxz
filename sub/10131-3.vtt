This is why God

01:35.054 --> 01:37.723
created Saturday.

01:39.349 --> 01:40.475
Let's watch MTV.

01:40.517 --> 01:42.394
No. Let's watch

01:40.517 --> 01:42.394
Bugs Bunny.

01:42.436 --> 01:44.980
But, Steph,

01:42.436 --> 01:44.980
Bugs Bunny is kid stuff.

01:45.022 --> 01:47.024
We got to watch

01:45.022 --> 01:47.024
Yogi Bear.

01:47.942 --> 01:50.193
But I like Bugs Bunny.

01:50.235 --> 01:52.696
Yeah, but, Steph,

01:50.235 --> 01:52.696
every episode is the same.

01:52.738 --> 01:55.824
Elmer Fudd says,

01:52.738 --> 01:55.824
"Why, you pesky wabbit."

01:55.866 --> 01:58.243
then he takes a shot

01:55.866 --> 01:58.243
at Bugs.

01:58.285 --> 01:59.995
Then Yosemite Sam comes in.

02:00.037 --> 02:04.332
"Ooh, ah hate

02:00.037 --> 02:04.332
that rabbit."

02:05.459 --> 02:07.044
Then he takes a shot

02:05.459 --> 02:07.044
at Bugs.

02:07.086 --> 02:09.170
I mean, with all

02:07.086 --> 02:09.170
that shooting going on

02:09.212 --> 02:11.048
I don't know why Bugs

02:09.212 --> 02:11.048
ever pops his head

02:11.090 --> 02:12.758
out of that hole.

02:12.800 --> 02:17.096
Let's face it. The rabbit

02:12.800 --> 02:17.096
has a death wish.

02:17.137 --> 02:21.767
Better than watching Yogi

02:17.137 --> 02:21.767
steal the same picnic basket.

02:21.809 --> 02:23.018
Boring.

02:24.603 --> 02:25.687
Morning, kids.

02:25.729 --> 02:27.481
Hi, dad.

02:27.522 --> 02:30.233
I don't really see you

02:27.522 --> 02:30.233
eating cereal out of pots

02:30.275 --> 02:32.152
with wooden

02:30.275 --> 02:32.152
implements, do I?

02:32.694 --> 02:34.404
Yes, you do.

02:34.446 --> 02:37.240
Great. After breakfast why don't

02:34.446 --> 02:37.240
we just take this laundry

02:37.282 --> 02:39.576
down to the bay and beat it

02:37.282 --> 02:39.576
against some rocks?

02:40.661 --> 02:43.163
Joey, can you

02:40.661 --> 02:43.163
come with me right now

02:43.204 --> 02:44.832
into the kitchen, please?

02:44.873 --> 02:47.459
What, now? I'll miss

02:44.873 --> 02:47.459
the start of Yogi.

02:47.501 --> 02:49.711
It's not

02:47.501 --> 02:49.711
Agatha Christie.

02:49.753 --> 02:51.212
You'll catch up.

02:52.631 --> 02:55.092
Girls, take

02:52.631 --> 02:55.092
accurate notes.

02:57.136 --> 02:58.595
Wha-ho-ho!

02:58.637 --> 03:01.765
It's howdy dirty time.

03:01.807 --> 03:03.433
Joey, the deal we made was

03:03.475 --> 03:05.686
this is your week

03:03.475 --> 03:05.686
to take care of the dishes.

03:05.727 --> 03:08.229
I'm just waiting till

03:05.727 --> 03:08.229
the dishwasher's full.

03:20.117 --> 03:22.870
There. Now we won't

03:20.117 --> 03:22.870
be wasting water.

03:22.911 --> 03:24.496
Of course we won't.

03:24.538 --> 03:26.915
There's no room

03:24.538 --> 03:26.915
for water.

03:28.375 --> 03:30.418
Boy, what a night.

03:30.460 --> 03:32.587
Jesse, what's

03:30.460 --> 03:32.587
going on here?

03:32.629 --> 03:34.381
You told me you were gonna

03:32.629 --> 03:34.381
take care of the laundry.

03:34.422 --> 03:36.008
I did.

03:34.422 --> 03:36.008
I did mine.

03:37.467 --> 03:40.054
What about

03:37.467 --> 03:40.054
everybody else's laundry?

03:40.095 --> 03:41.346
Looks to me like

03:40.095 --> 03:41.346
they haven't touched it.

03:41.388 --> 03:44.099
The lazy bums.

03:44.141 --> 03:45.809
Fellas, let me tell you

03:44.141 --> 03:45.809
about this story alright?

03:45.851 --> 03:48.395
Last night, my band's playing

03:45.851 --> 03:48.395
this gig in Chinatown.

03:48.436 --> 03:51.106
A sweet and sour

03:48.436 --> 03:51.106
16 party, if you will.

03:51.148 --> 03:54.651
Anyway, anyway, I'm cruising

03:51.148 --> 03:54.651
home on my Harley, right?

03:54.693 --> 03:56.403
I come to a red light,

03:54.693 --> 03:56.403
I stop.

03:56.444 --> 03:57.445
Great story.

03:57.487 --> 03:59.740
Oh, and you told it great.

03:59.781 --> 04:01.700
Fellas, I'm building.

03:59.781 --> 04:01.700
I'm building. I'm building.

04:01.742 --> 04:03.284
Anyway, the light

04:01.742 --> 04:03.284
turns green, right?

04:03.326 --> 04:05.245
I try to move.

04:03.326 --> 04:05.245
I can't.

04:05.286 --> 04:07.122
There's something

04:05.286 --> 04:07.122
wedged under my tire.

04:07.164 --> 04:09.583
Just then this runaway

04:07.164 --> 04:09.583
street cleaner

04:09.624 --> 04:11.043
comes barreling through

04:09.624 --> 04:11.043
the intersection

04:11.085 --> 04:12.794
right where

04:11.085 --> 04:12.794
I would have been.

04:12.836 --> 04:14.421
I came this close

04:12.836 --> 04:14.421
to being

04:14.462 --> 04:15.964
a really clean dead guy.

04:17.382 --> 04:18.717
Fellas, I'd like to

04:17.382 --> 04:18.717
introduce to you

04:18.759 --> 04:21.011
the little dude

04:18.759 --> 04:21.011
that saved my life..

04:21.678 --> 04:22.804
...Bubba!

04:28.268 --> 04:30.145
I love

04:28.268 --> 04:30.145
this amphibian.

04:31.438 --> 04:33.523
You just hate coming

04:31.438 --> 04:33.523
home alone, don't you?

04:36.026 --> 04:37.778
I got to get my guitar.

04:36.026 --> 04:37.778
Hold Bubba.

04:37.819 --> 04:38.946
Keep him happy.

04:38.987 --> 04:40.572
It just may save your life.

04:42.574 --> 04:44.325
(D.J.)

04:42.574 --> 04:44.325
'Joey, where are you?'

04:44.367 --> 04:45.619
Don't let the girls

04:44.367 --> 04:45.619
see him.

04:45.660 --> 04:46.787
They're gonna

04:45.660 --> 04:46.787
want to keep him.

04:46.828 --> 04:48.705
Hide him, hide him.

04:50.124 --> 04:52.292
The pot.

04:50.124 --> 04:52.292
Under the pot.

04:52.333 --> 04:53.710
Great idea.

04:53.752 --> 04:55.295
- Okay.

04:55.336 --> 04:56.504
I don't

04:55.336 --> 04:56.504
see a turtle.

04:56.546 --> 04:58.715
- Act casual.

04:56.546 --> 04:58.715
- Oh, yeah, nonchalant.

04:58.757 --> 05:00.259
- Good word. Nonchalant.

04:58.757 --> 05:00.259
- Hmm-mm.

05:01.676 --> 05:04.471
Joey, Yogi may be smarter

05:01.676 --> 05:04.471
than the average bear

05:04.512 --> 05:07.432
but he's much dumber

05:04.512 --> 05:07.432
than the average 3-year-old.

05:10.393 --> 05:11.603
What's that?

05:12.687 --> 05:13.730
Oh, that?

05:13.772 --> 05:15.732
That's, uh...

05:13.772 --> 05:15.732
it's dinner.

05:15.774 --> 05:17.400
It's roast beef.

05:15.774 --> 05:17.400
Yeah. Roast beef.

05:23.031 --> 05:25.575
And where is

05:23.031 --> 05:25.575
our roast beef going?

05:26.952 --> 05:29.830
It's going

05:26.952 --> 05:29.830
to the oven.

05:32.040 --> 05:34.293
Roast beef

05:32.040 --> 05:34.293
comes from turtle?

05:35.252 --> 05:37.504
Not my turtle,

05:35.252 --> 05:37.504
it doesn't.

05:38.797 --> 05:40.715
I love

05:38.797 --> 05:40.715
this amphibian.

05:40.757 --> 05:43.135
I love him, too.

05:40.757 --> 05:43.135
Can we keep him?

05:43.177 --> 05:45.304
Of course we can keep him.

05:43.177 --> 05:45.304
Bubba's a hero.

05:45.344 --> 05:47.181
Uncle Jesse, we'll take

05:45.344 --> 05:47.181
care of him for you.

05:47.222 --> 05:48.932
- Alright.

05:47.222 --> 05:48.932
- Are you sure, honey?

05:48.974 --> 05:50.349
That's a big

05:48.974 --> 05:50.349
responsibility.

05:50.391 --> 05:51.392
No problem.

05:51.434 --> 05:53.145
Let's go get

05:51.434 --> 05:53.145
Bubba settled.

05:53.187 --> 05:55.147
He looks

05:53.187 --> 05:55.147
a little pasty.

05:56.481 --> 05:57.858
What a great day.

05:57.899 --> 06:00.861
We get a turtle,

05:57.899 --> 06:00.861
and grandma's coming to visit.

06:01.778 --> 06:03.071
Stephanie.

06:05.073 --> 06:07.034
Sweetheart, honey.

06:07.075 --> 06:08.451
Baby.

06:08.493 --> 06:10.287
Did you just say

06:08.493 --> 06:10.287
grandma's coming?

06:10.329 --> 06:12.873
That's what she said

06:10.329 --> 06:12.873
on the phone.

06:12.914 --> 06:14.666
Well, why didn't you

06:12.914 --> 06:14.666
say something?

06:14.708 --> 06:16.543
Nobody asked me.

06:18.879 --> 06:23.675
Steph, it's not possible for me

06:18.879 --> 06:23.675
to ask you every question.

06:23.717 --> 06:25.719
Do you know how many questions

06:23.717 --> 06:25.719
there are in the world?

06:27.304 --> 06:28.387
Eight.

06:34.978 --> 06:36.604
What time is

06:34.978 --> 06:36.604
grandma coming, honey?

06:37.772 --> 06:41.151
The plane gets in

06:37.772 --> 06:41.151
at 5:12, sugar hips.

06:44.571 --> 06:47.741
Sweetheart, go upstairs

06:44.571 --> 06:47.741
and play with Bubba.

06:48.950 --> 06:52.579
Joey, how did you know

06:48.950 --> 06:52.579
about my mother?

06:52.620 --> 06:54.956
I answered the phone

06:52.620 --> 06:54.956
when she called.

06:54.998 --> 06:56.624
Why didn't

06:54.998 --> 06:56.624
you say something?

06:56.666 --> 06:58.417
Nobody asked me.

07:00.128 --> 07:01.838
Found a home

07:00.128 --> 07:01.838
for Bubba.

07:01.880 --> 07:04.716
It's calm, cool,

07:01.880 --> 07:04.716
comfortable.

07:04.758 --> 07:05.967
Nobody flush, okay?

07:07.802 --> 07:09.846
Alright,

07:07.802 --> 07:09.846
I'll shred him lunch.

07:09.888 --> 07:11.556
I'll swat him dessert.

07:11.598 --> 07:12.766
Jesse,

07:11.598 --> 07:12.766
forget about the turtle.

07:12.807 --> 07:14.559
My mom's on her way.

07:14.601 --> 07:16.895
Your mom's coming back already?

07:14.601 --> 07:16.895
She just moved out of here.

07:16.937 --> 07:19.064
I know that, but she's coming

07:16.937 --> 07:19.064
back to check up on me.

07:19.106 --> 07:20.941
She doesn't think I can

07:19.106 --> 07:20.941
take care of things.

07:20.982 --> 07:23.318
What? The place

07:20.982 --> 07:23.318
looks great.

07:23.360 --> 07:24.778
You don't understand.

07:24.819 --> 07:26.780
All my life I've had somebody

07:24.819 --> 07:26.780
take care of me.

07:26.821 --> 07:28.031
First it was my mom

07:28.073 --> 07:29.824
and then I got married,

07:28.073 --> 07:29.824
and it was Pam.

07:29.866 --> 07:32.619
For the first time, I want to

07:29.866 --> 07:32.619
prove to my mom and to myself

07:32.660 --> 07:33.995
that I can take care of my

07:32.660 --> 07:33.995
family

07:34.037 --> 07:36.790
on my own, by myself,

07:34.037 --> 07:36.790
just me.

07:36.831 --> 07:40.210
That's why I desperately

07:36.831 --> 07:40.210
need your help.

07:40.252 --> 07:42.003
- What do you want us to do?

07:40.252 --> 07:42.003
- Yeah.

07:42.045 --> 07:43.380
Jesse, take another shot

07:42.045 --> 07:43.380
at the laundry.

07:43.422 --> 07:44.631
Alright.

07:44.672 --> 07:46.425
Joey, see if you can wedge some

07:44.672 --> 07:46.425
detergent

07:46.466 --> 07:47.634
into the dishwasher.

07:47.675 --> 07:49.261
I'm gonna mop the floor.

07:50.511 --> 07:52.973
Bad news, dad-o.

07:50.511 --> 07:52.973
We're out of detergent.

07:53.014 --> 07:54.515
Ditto on dish soap.

07:54.557 --> 07:56.643
And we're

07:54.557 --> 07:56.643
out of floor wax.

07:56.684 --> 07:58.478
Let's go shopping.

08:00.021 --> 08:03.066
Whoa! You're

08:00.021 --> 08:03.066
in your pajamas.

08:03.108 --> 08:04.651
Oh, I know.

08:03.108 --> 08:04.651
I just woke up.

08:05.568 --> 08:08.196
[laughing]

08:05.568 --> 08:08.196
Oh, I get it.

08:09.697 --> 08:12.075
I gotta go

08:09.697 --> 08:12.075
put clothes on.

08:12.117 --> 08:16.037
Gee, I wish you could

08:12.117 --> 08:16.037
wear pajamas at the market.

08:19.291 --> 08:21.751
He may need

08:19.291 --> 08:21.751
his mother.

08:23.337 --> 08:25.046
D.J., let's go.

08:23.337 --> 08:25.046
Stephanie, hurry up.

08:25.088 --> 08:26.173
Grandma's gonna be here

08:26.214 --> 08:27.966
in t-minus-seven hours and

08:26.214 --> 08:27.966
counting.

08:28.008 --> 08:31.178
Can't we wait

08:28.008 --> 08:31.178
till Yogi's over?

08:31.219 --> 08:32.553
Tape it.

08:33.721 --> 08:34.806
Of course

08:33.721 --> 08:34.806
I'm gonna tape it.

08:34.848 --> 08:37.309
I tape all of them.

08:37.351 --> 08:41.271
It's just that Yogi

08:37.351 --> 08:41.271
is so much better live.

08:41.313 --> 08:45.233
Alright, we need

08:41.313 --> 08:45.233
turtle chow, leafy green..

08:45.275 --> 08:47.652
...there's no such thing

08:45.275 --> 08:47.652
as fly helper, is there?

08:48.569 --> 08:49.696
No, okay.

08:51.239 --> 08:53.950
I got the baby diapers, baby

08:51.239 --> 08:53.950
wipes, extra baby clothes

08:53.992 --> 08:54.951
and the baby's backpack.

08:54.993 --> 08:56.036
Great.

08:56.077 --> 08:57.829
Here's baby apple juice

08:57.871 --> 08:59.206
and baby biter biscuits.

08:59.247 --> 09:01.208
- Wonderful.

08:59.247 --> 09:01.208
- The baby loves music.

09:01.249 --> 09:04.127
You think we should bring along

09:01.249 --> 09:04.127
the organ?

09:04.169 --> 09:05.253
I got it covered.

09:05.295 --> 09:08.965
I'm bringing

09:05.295 --> 09:08.965
her crib blaster.

09:09.590 --> 09:12.344
Okay, troops..

09:12.386 --> 09:14.179
...move out!

09:15.013 --> 09:16.764
Don't forget

09:15.013 --> 09:16.764
Mr. Pandy.

09:16.806 --> 09:18.475
Oh, that's right,

09:16.806 --> 09:18.475
honey.

09:18.517 --> 09:21.144
Michelle won't go anywhere

09:18.517 --> 09:21.144
without Mr. Pandy.

09:21.186 --> 09:24.981
Let's go.

09:21.186 --> 09:24.981
Everybody move it.

09:30.362 --> 09:32.613
I am so sorry.

09:36.201 --> 09:38.619
You won't remember this,

09:36.201 --> 09:38.619
will you?

09:43.500 --> 09:45.585
How many times do

09:43.500 --> 09:45.585
I have to tell you?

09:45.626 --> 09:49.047
Make a tinkle before

09:45.626 --> 09:49.047
you leave the house.

09:58.557 --> 09:59.891
Coming up.

09:59.933 --> 10:01.142
Coming up.

10:01.184 --> 10:02.143
It's up.

10:02.185 --> 10:03.520
Coming up.

10:03.562 --> 10:04.938
Coming up.

10:04.979 --> 10:07.399
Don't we have

10:04.979 --> 10:07.399
one of these?

10:08.400 --> 10:10.277
I'll take Michelle.

10:12.446 --> 10:14.906
I hate this thing.

10:17.825 --> 10:19.702
Only five hours before

10:17.825 --> 10:19.702
my mom shows up.

10:19.744 --> 10:21.538
Now, here's the plan,

10:19.744 --> 10:21.538
I'll do the kitchen

10:21.580 --> 10:22.622
Joey, you do

10:21.580 --> 10:22.622
the living room.

10:22.663 --> 10:23.957
Jess, you take

10:22.663 --> 10:23.957
the bedrooms.

10:23.998 --> 10:25.333
Now, who's going to

10:23.998 --> 10:25.333
do the toilets?

10:27.294 --> 10:30.213
Oh, girls.

10:32.924 --> 10:35.676
Giddy up, Bubba,

10:32.924 --> 10:35.676
giddy up.

10:35.718 --> 10:38.096
Come on. Come on.

10:38.138 --> 10:39.598
Can I go next?

10:40.640 --> 10:41.849
Look at Bubba.

10:41.891 --> 10:44.311
Ever seen a turtle

10:41.891 --> 10:44.311
that good with kids?

10:44.352 --> 10:46.813
D.J., go put Annie Oakley

10:44.352 --> 10:46.813
in her bunkhouse.

10:47.981 --> 10:49.899
Jesse, find a corral

10:47.981 --> 10:49.899
for Trigger.

10:51.109 --> 10:53.111
Joey, I'm all out

10:51.109 --> 10:53.111
of cowboy metaphors

10:53.153 --> 10:55.155
so let's put away

10:53.153 --> 10:55.155
the grub.

10:55.196 --> 10:56.906
I was wrong.

10:55.196 --> 10:56.906
I had one left.

10:56.948 --> 10:58.992
Danny, we've been shopping

10:56.948 --> 10:58.992
all morning.

10:59.033 --> 11:00.785
How about

10:59.033 --> 11:00.785
a little Yogi break?

11:00.827 --> 11:02.454
Sit down

11:00.827 --> 11:02.454
with your family here.

11:02.496 --> 11:04.623
Relax.

11:02.496 --> 11:04.623
Watch the bear.

11:04.664 --> 11:07.334
Alright, alright,

11:04.664 --> 11:07.334
but we're just gonna watch

11:07.375 --> 11:09.377
until Yogi steals

11:07.375 --> 11:09.377
a picnic basket.

11:10.920 --> 11:12.839
Okay. He's got one.

11:13.923 --> 11:16.426
Hi, yi-yi..

11:16.468 --> 11:18.637
- Grandma!

11:21.181 --> 11:23.642
Oh, my God.

11:25.768 --> 11:27.521
Oh, my God.

11:27.562 --> 11:30.398
My granddaughter

11:27.562 --> 11:30.398
is a turtle.

11:34.735 --> 11:38.072
Michelle needs your love

11:34.735 --> 11:38.072
now more than ever.

11:39.366 --> 11:41.159
Give me that.

11:41.201 --> 11:42.661
This turtle

11:41.201 --> 11:42.661
saved my life.

11:42.701 --> 11:45.288
Bubba, Claire.

11:42.701 --> 11:45.288
Claire, Bubba.

11:45.330 --> 11:46.373
Hi.

11:46.414 --> 11:48.625
I love

11:46.414 --> 11:48.625
this amphibian.

11:48.667 --> 11:50.335
Isn't he cool?

11:51.670 --> 11:53.672
Pet his head, grandma.

11:51.670 --> 11:53.672
He really likes that.

11:53.712 --> 11:55.340
Oh, he's a reptile!

11:55.382 --> 11:58.051
Hey, back off. He's been

11:55.382 --> 11:58.051
nothing but nice to you.

11:59.386 --> 12:01.846
Mom, what are you

11:59.386 --> 12:01.846
doing here so early?

12:01.888 --> 12:03.973
Joey said

12:01.888 --> 12:03.973
you'd be in at 5:12.

12:04.474 --> 12:06.685
Try 12:05.

12:09.270 --> 12:11.856
I guess you had

12:09.270 --> 12:11.856
to find out sooner or later.

12:13.650 --> 12:16.528
My name is Joey,

12:13.650 --> 12:16.528
and I'm a time dyslexic.

12:19.989 --> 12:21.199
I would have

12:19.989 --> 12:21.199
told you earlier

12:21.241 --> 12:24.118
but I'm just not sure

12:21.241 --> 12:24.118
when earlier is.

12:26.120 --> 12:29.040
Girls, will you just go on

12:26.120 --> 12:29.040
upstairs and clean your room?

12:29.082 --> 12:32.419
How did she know

12:29.082 --> 12:32.419
our room is a mess?

12:32.460 --> 12:34.045
Grandma vision.

12:37.632 --> 12:39.259
Mom, don't worry.

12:39.300 --> 12:41.553
We're on the verge of a major

12:39.300 --> 12:41.553
cleanup. Aren't we, boys?

12:41.595 --> 12:43.471
Well, we were, but

12:41.595 --> 12:43.471
now what's the point?

12:43.513 --> 12:45.557
I mean, no one cleans

12:43.513 --> 12:45.557
the house like your ma.

12:45.599 --> 12:46.641
Right, Joseph?

12:46.683 --> 12:48.393
Oh, you're awesome,

12:46.683 --> 12:48.393
Mrs. Tanner.

12:48.435 --> 12:51.104
Yeah. So why don't

12:48.435 --> 12:51.104
we just get out of your way?

12:51.145 --> 12:53.189
And, Claire,

12:51.145 --> 12:53.189
go nuts.

12:54.148 --> 12:55.275
Absolutely.

12:55.316 --> 12:57.110
We'll-we'll catch

12:55.316 --> 12:57.110
a movie or something

12:57.151 --> 13:01.155
and, Mrs. Tanner, if you happen

12:57.151 --> 13:01.155
to finish up before we get back

13:01.197 --> 13:03.866
I'd just like to leave you

13:01.197 --> 13:03.866
with these two words..

13:03.908 --> 13:06.369
...lamb chops.

13:08.787 --> 13:09.872
Don't listen to him, mom.

13:09.914 --> 13:12.083
You can cook

13:09.914 --> 13:12.083
anything you want.

13:17.880 --> 13:20.675
Honey, we're home.

13:20.717 --> 13:22.176
Boys, we got some trouble.

13:22.218 --> 13:23.720
I'll say we got trouble.

13:23.762 --> 13:26.514
Look at this place.

13:23.762 --> 13:26.514
It's a pigsty.

13:26.556 --> 13:29.183
I think your ma's

13:26.556 --> 13:29.183
lost her touch.

13:29.225 --> 13:31.018
She doesn't want to

13:29.225 --> 13:31.018
clean up our mess.

13:31.060 --> 13:32.353
She wants us to do it.

13:33.605 --> 13:35.189
She wants<i> us</i>

13:33.605 --> 13:35.189
to do it?

13:36.691 --> 13:40.819
What's the matter? Can't you

13:36.691 --> 13:40.819
handle your ma, you wimp?

13:40.861 --> 13:42.614
You're totally

13:40.861 --> 13:42.614
mommy whipped.

13:42.656 --> 13:44.783
Oh, I suppose you handle

13:42.656 --> 13:44.783
your mom differently?

13:44.823 --> 13:46.825
I play my ma

13:44.823 --> 13:46.825
like a piano.

13:48.077 --> 13:50.455
Well, I'm glad

13:48.077 --> 13:50.455
you're back.

13:50.497 --> 13:52.039
Come on in.

13:55.502 --> 13:57.462
Your mom called our moms?

14:03.593 --> 14:05.219
Hello, Jesse.

14:05.261 --> 14:06.805
Hi, Joey.

14:07.846 --> 14:10.099
- Hi, mom.

14:11.225 --> 14:13.102
Yes, I thought that

14:11.225 --> 14:13.102
Irene and Mindy

14:13.144 --> 14:16.230
would be very interested

14:13.144 --> 14:16.230
to see how you boys keep house.

14:17.898 --> 14:19.400
Okay, piano man.

14:19.442 --> 14:20.819
Why don't you

14:19.442 --> 14:20.819
show the wimp

14:20.860 --> 14:23.154
how to tickle

14:20.860 --> 14:23.154
those ivories?

14:27.033 --> 14:28.159
Ma.

14:29.577 --> 14:31.412
Jesse.

14:31.454 --> 14:33.122
Can I make you

14:31.454 --> 14:33.122
some tea?

14:33.956 --> 14:35.208
Bravo. Bravo.

14:35.249 --> 14:36.334
Shut up.

14:36.376 --> 14:37.544
No tea,

14:36.376 --> 14:37.544
thank you.

14:37.585 --> 14:39.170
Oh, tuck in

14:37.585 --> 14:39.170
your shirt.

14:39.212 --> 14:40.171
Ma!

14:40.213 --> 14:42.841
- Oh, Jesse.

14:40.213 --> 14:42.841
- Alright.

14:42.882 --> 14:45.426
I remember when you

14:42.882 --> 14:45.426
were eight years old.

14:45.468 --> 14:46.803
Oh, ma, please

14:45.468 --> 14:46.803
don't tell that story.

14:46.845 --> 14:50.139
Oh, no, tell. Tell.

14:46.845 --> 14:50.139
We love stories.

14:50.181 --> 14:51.850
I'll never forget it.

14:51.891 --> 14:54.769
My little Jesse

14:51.891 --> 14:54.769
tugged on my apron

14:54.811 --> 14:58.064
and said, "Mommy, can

14:54.811 --> 14:58.064
I please help you iron?"

14:58.105 --> 15:00.817
I said, "sure.

14:58.105 --> 15:00.817
Finish the sleeve."

15:02.151 --> 15:04.153
It must have been like when

15:02.151 --> 15:04.153
Babe Ruth

15:04.195 --> 15:06.573
picked up his first bat.

15:06.614 --> 15:08.700
To this day,

15:06.614 --> 15:08.700
he's the only one I'll trust

15:08.742 --> 15:10.368
with my chiffon blouses.

15:15.415 --> 15:17.584
To iron or wear?

15:19.627 --> 15:21.671
Hey, man, to iron.

15:22.672 --> 15:24.215
Alright,

15:22.672 --> 15:24.215
enough of this talking.

15:24.257 --> 15:25.925
Now, you boys

15:24.257 --> 15:25.925
have a lot of work to do.

15:25.966 --> 15:27.427
So where's

15:25.966 --> 15:27.427
the vacuum cleaner?

15:27.468 --> 15:29.721
Oh, vacuum cleaner?

15:27.468 --> 15:29.721
We'll handle this.

15:30.889 --> 15:32.223
Uh, mom, let's show

15:30.889 --> 15:32.223
them the hoover.

15:32.265 --> 15:35.518
Great. You're just

15:32.265 --> 15:35.518
gonna love this.

15:37.061 --> 15:39.689
Brrrrr!

15:40.189 --> 15:42.901
Brrrrr!

15:43.902 --> 15:45.069
Uh, Mindy.

15:45.111 --> 15:47.071
Oh. Of course.

15:47.113 --> 15:49.365
Now, now, Joey, there is a time

15:47.113 --> 15:49.365
to have fun

15:49.407 --> 15:51.367
and a time to be serious.

15:51.409 --> 15:53.327
Listen, girls,

15:51.409 --> 15:53.327
I think that one of us

15:53.369 --> 15:55.996
should be here at all times

15:53.369 --> 15:55.996
to see that things go properly.

15:56.038 --> 15:59.208
So, I mean, after all, this is

15:56.038 --> 15:59.208
where our grandchildren live.

15:59.250 --> 16:00.794
You are so right.

16:00.835 --> 16:02.629
I can be here Monday

16:00.835 --> 16:02.629
through Wednesday.

16:02.670 --> 16:04.464
Well, I'm free

16:02.670 --> 16:04.464
Thursdays and Fridays.

16:04.505 --> 16:05.965
That's wonderful.

16:06.006 --> 16:07.801
And I can fly in on the weekends

16:06.006 --> 16:07.801
so it's all settled.

16:07.842 --> 16:09.969
Terrific.

16:10.010 --> 16:12.513
Boys, we are staring

16:10.010 --> 16:12.513
into the jaws

16:12.555 --> 16:14.474
of a never-ending

16:12.555 --> 16:14.474
living hell.

16:14.515 --> 16:15.809
- What?

16:14.515 --> 16:15.809
- Hey!

16:15.850 --> 16:17.560
No offense.

16:17.602 --> 16:20.396
Moms, I don't blame you

16:17.602 --> 16:20.396
for treating us like children.

16:20.438 --> 16:23.441
I mean, 'cause sometimes

16:20.438 --> 16:23.441
that's how we act.

16:23.483 --> 16:25.318
Yeah, listen, girls,

16:23.483 --> 16:25.318
when we moved in here

16:25.359 --> 16:27.570
we know we had some

16:25.359 --> 16:27.570
responsibilities to do

16:27.612 --> 16:29.322
but we haven't really

16:27.612 --> 16:29.322
followed through.

16:29.363 --> 16:31.950
And from now on, we're really

16:29.363 --> 16:31.950
gonna buckle down.

16:31.991 --> 16:34.494
Mothers, I have

16:31.991 --> 16:34.494
a proposition for you..

16:34.535 --> 16:36.454
...you all go shopping

16:34.535 --> 16:36.454
for a couple of hours.

16:36.496 --> 16:39.499
And if this place isn't clean

16:36.496 --> 16:39.499
by the time you get back

16:39.540 --> 16:42.836
you can all move in here

16:39.540 --> 16:42.836
and just run our lives forever.

16:43.377 --> 16:44.462
Deal?

16:50.301 --> 16:51.594
- Deal.

16:55.139 --> 16:57.892
Okay, there's

16:55.139 --> 16:57.892
the bathroom.

16:57.934 --> 17:01.312
Yep, there's

16:57.934 --> 17:01.312
the bathroom.

17:01.354 --> 17:04.607
Same place it was last time

17:01.354 --> 17:04.607
we didn't clean it.

17:11.155 --> 17:12.782
Here's a thought.

17:12.824 --> 17:13.992
Why don't we see

17:12.824 --> 17:13.992
if the girls have finished

17:14.033 --> 17:14.951
cleaning their room?

17:14.993 --> 17:17.578
Loving it.

17:20.874 --> 17:22.792
(Danny)

17:20.874 --> 17:22.792
'What happened?'

17:22.834 --> 17:25.461
There's been

17:22.834 --> 17:25.461
a bedroom tornado.

17:27.213 --> 17:29.298
We lost something.

17:29.340 --> 17:31.759
Might that

17:29.340 --> 17:31.759
be your minds?

17:34.595 --> 17:36.514
We lost..

17:36.556 --> 17:37.724
[mumbling]

17:39.225 --> 17:41.060
What exactly is..

17:41.101 --> 17:42.395
[mumbling]

17:42.436 --> 17:44.313
[mumbling]

17:44.355 --> 17:47.066
Is what you say when you don't

17:44.355 --> 17:47.066
want to say..

17:48.860 --> 17:50.653
...Bubba.

17:50.695 --> 17:53.072
You lost Bubba?

17:54.032 --> 17:56.868
He loves

17:54.032 --> 17:56.868
that amphibian.

17:57.869 --> 17:59.286
We're really sorry.

17:59.328 --> 18:01.831
We turned our backs,

17:59.328 --> 18:01.831
for one minute and he was gone.

18:01.873 --> 18:03.624
It's okay, girls.

18:01.873 --> 18:03.624
I'm sure Bubba

18:03.666 --> 18:05.125
is somewhere

18:03.666 --> 18:05.125
in the house.

18:05.167 --> 18:06.753
Alright, guys, we're

18:05.167 --> 18:06.753
going to turn this house

18:06.794 --> 18:09.005
upside-down until

18:06.794 --> 18:09.005
we find that turtle.

18:09.047 --> 18:10.048
Ready? Go.

18:10.089 --> 18:11.007
(all)

18:10.089 --> 18:11.007
'Bubba!'

18:11.049 --> 18:13.593
Bubba!

18:11.049 --> 18:13.593
Where are you?

18:19.933 --> 18:21.851
No Bubba?

18:21.893 --> 18:23.227
No Bubba.

18:25.563 --> 18:28.858
Uncle Jesse, me and Steph

18:25.563 --> 18:28.858
will buy you another turtle.

18:29.984 --> 18:34.363
You can have

18:29.984 --> 18:34.363
all my money...$2.58.

18:38.534 --> 18:40.536
My advice is

18:38.534 --> 18:40.536
don't clean anymore.

18:40.578 --> 18:42.705
Just move.

18:43.539 --> 18:44.791
We'll be right

18:43.539 --> 18:44.791
with you.

18:44.832 --> 18:46.876
We're having a little

18:44.832 --> 18:46.876
family problem here.

18:46.918 --> 18:51.130
We'll look for Bubba

18:46.918 --> 18:51.130
for the rest of our lives.

18:51.171 --> 18:53.091
Aw, it's alright.

18:53.132 --> 18:55.093
Bubba's work here

18:53.132 --> 18:55.093
was done.

18:55.134 --> 18:57.303
I'm sure he's out

18:55.134 --> 18:57.303
in the world saving other lives.

18:58.512 --> 19:01.140
You mean, you're

18:58.512 --> 19:01.140
really not mad at us?

19:01.181 --> 19:03.893
You don't think we'd get mad

19:01.181 --> 19:03.893
over a stinky turtle?

19:05.561 --> 19:08.188
Hey, if you had four armpits and

19:05.561 --> 19:08.188
you were an inch off the ground

19:08.230 --> 19:09.565
how would you smell?

19:12.192 --> 19:15.529
Girls, girls,

19:12.192 --> 19:15.529
I know you feel bad.

19:15.571 --> 19:17.406
But, that's because you love

19:15.571 --> 19:17.406
your uncle Jesse

19:17.448 --> 19:19.826
and you feel like

19:17.448 --> 19:19.826
you let him down.

19:19.867 --> 19:22.161
I know that losing Bubba

19:19.867 --> 19:22.161
was an accident.

19:23.788 --> 19:26.082
You've got

19:23.788 --> 19:26.082
to understand

19:26.124 --> 19:28.334
we're right behind you

19:26.124 --> 19:28.334
no matter what you do.

19:28.375 --> 19:30.711
And if you ever

19:28.375 --> 19:30.711
have a problem

19:30.753 --> 19:31.879
we'll be there

19:30.753 --> 19:31.879
for you.

19:31.921 --> 19:33.089
That's right.

19:33.131 --> 19:34.590
And if we ever have a problem

19:34.632 --> 19:36.425
we know you guys would be there

19:34.632 --> 19:36.425
for us, too, right?

19:37.718 --> 19:39.219
Alright. Come here,

19:37.718 --> 19:39.219
you little munchkins.

19:39.261 --> 19:40.513
Give us a hug.

19:40.554 --> 19:42.389
- Alright!

19:42.431 --> 19:43.641
Next.

19:47.227 --> 19:49.730
That is so sweet.

19:49.772 --> 19:52.483
Alright, enough of

19:49.772 --> 19:52.483
this warmth junk.

19:52.525 --> 19:55.528
Oh, we're gonna have a great

19:52.525 --> 19:55.528
time living here, right, girls?

19:55.569 --> 19:57.196
Oh, yes.

19:55.569 --> 19:57.196
You bet.

19:58.447 --> 19:59.782
Just a minute, ladies.

20:01.117 --> 20:03.536
We would like another

20:01.117 --> 20:03.536
shot at this, please.

20:03.577 --> 20:06.330
Why don't you take the girls

20:03.577 --> 20:06.330
to the zoo for 3 hours?

20:06.372 --> 20:07.665
- Yeah.

20:08.666 --> 20:10.334
We got some work to do,

20:08.666 --> 20:10.334
alright?

20:10.376 --> 20:11.836
Alright.

20:14.714 --> 20:16.674

21:07.141 --> 21:08.768
Owww!

21:11.520 --> 21:13.355
- Owww!

21:11.520 --> 21:13.355
- Whoo!

21:15.024 --> 21:16.192
I split my pants.

21:16.234 --> 21:17.484
I can't stand

21:16.234 --> 21:17.484
my pants.

21:17.526 --> 21:19.070
Ow!

21:19.112 --> 21:21.989
Okay, guys, we made it with

21:19.112 --> 21:21.989
five seconds to spare.

21:22.031 --> 21:24.075
Come on.

21:22.031 --> 21:24.075
Everybody up.

21:24.117 --> 21:25.159
Let's go.

21:25.201 --> 21:30.581
5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

21:30.623 --> 21:33.667
Oh. We completely

21:30.623 --> 21:33.667
lost track of the time.

21:33.709 --> 21:35.878
Oh! It's immaculate.

21:35.920 --> 21:40.382
Grandma Irene, does this mean

21:35.920 --> 21:40.382
hell is freezing over?

21:43.928 --> 21:47.347
Go on, find a speck of dirt,

21:43.928 --> 21:47.347
a microbe of filth.

21:47.389 --> 21:49.183
I double dare you.

21:49.225 --> 21:51.269
- Okay.

21:49.225 --> 21:51.269
- Alright.

21:52.770 --> 21:54.396
- Hey!

21:52.770 --> 21:54.396
- Whoa!

21:54.438 --> 21:56.107
That's not

21:54.438 --> 21:56.107
where these go.

21:56.149 --> 21:57.900
You take grandma's goodies,

21:56.149 --> 21:57.900
and you take them right upstairs

21:57.942 --> 21:59.610
and put them

21:57.942 --> 21:59.610
in the toy box now.

21:59.652 --> 22:00.778
- Whoa!

22:00.820 --> 22:03.030
And he used to be

22:00.820 --> 22:03.030
the easy one.

22:06.284 --> 22:07.409
Hold it! Hold it!

22:09.536 --> 22:12.623
You're about to enter

22:09.536 --> 22:12.623
a sterile environment.

22:13.582 --> 22:16.210
[turns on vacuum]

22:18.004 --> 22:19.672
Don't even

22:18.004 --> 22:19.672
think about it.

22:21.507 --> 22:23.843
Ma, what about

22:21.507 --> 22:23.843
those creases, huh?

22:23.884 --> 22:27.138
Jesse, you still

22:23.884 --> 22:27.138
have your touch.

22:27.180 --> 22:30.057
Perfect. Everything

22:27.180 --> 22:30.057
is just perfect.

22:30.099 --> 22:32.392
Look, mom, you could

22:30.099 --> 22:32.392
eat off these dishes.

22:33.602 --> 22:34.603
Congratulations.

22:34.645 --> 22:37.273
I am really proud

22:34.645 --> 22:37.273
of all of you.

22:38.607 --> 22:40.693
Sorry.

22:38.607 --> 22:40.693
Bank's closed.

22:40.734 --> 22:42.569
Can you pay me

22:40.734 --> 22:42.569
in cash?

22:44.404 --> 22:47.867
Mom, I'd like you to meet

22:44.404 --> 22:47.867
my fiancee, Jennifer.

22:49.118 --> 22:51.120
You're going to give me

22:49.118 --> 22:51.120
a grandchild?

22:52.412 --> 22:54.707
Not for this kind

22:52.412 --> 22:54.707
of money.

22:55.708 --> 22:57.168
Here you go,

22:55.708 --> 22:57.168
Mrs. Sianski.

22:57.210 --> 22:59.712
Thanks for everything.

22:57.210 --> 22:59.712
See you next weekend.

22:59.753 --> 23:01.672
Oh, sure.

23:01.714 --> 23:03.632
Okay, so we had

23:01.714 --> 23:03.632
a little help.

23:03.674 --> 23:05.509
Well, just with the hard stuff

23:03.674 --> 23:05.509
and the toilets.

23:05.551 --> 23:08.012
But we make

23:05.551 --> 23:08.012
a great team.

23:08.054 --> 23:11.765
From now on, things are gonna

23:08.054 --> 23:11.765
go a lot smoother around here.

23:11.807 --> 23:14.101
I'm sure they will.

23:14.143 --> 23:16.436
Does that mean you

23:14.143 --> 23:16.436
won't need us anymore?

23:18.939 --> 23:20.358
Ooh, they're good.

23:21.275 --> 23:22.400
Of course

23:21.275 --> 23:22.400
we still need you.

23:22.442 --> 23:24.945
You girls come by

23:22.442 --> 23:24.945
and visit anytime.

23:24.987 --> 23:27.865
Okay, listen, I have to admit

23:24.987 --> 23:27.865
that I was a little worried

23:27.907 --> 23:31.035
about how you boys

23:27.907 --> 23:31.035
were managing the girls.

23:31.077 --> 23:32.370
Well, you may be a little sloppy

23:32.410 --> 23:35.748
but...those kids

23:32.410 --> 23:35.748
are getting a lot of love.

23:36.749 --> 23:38.125
Aw, thanks, mom.

23:42.420 --> 23:44.131
Aw, this is nice.

23:44.173 --> 23:47.467
I wish Bubba was here

23:44.173 --> 23:47.467
to share this.

23:50.930 --> 23:52.098
(D.J.)

23:50.930 --> 23:52.098
'Bubba!'

23:53.682 --> 23:55.017
I found him.

23:57.228 --> 23:59.855
I love that amphibian.
