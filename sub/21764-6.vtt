My peoples!

00:48.631 --> 00:49.883
Through that horrifying,

00:49.966 --> 00:53.553
traumatic tropical storm
that ravaged our kingdom,

00:53.636 --> 00:56.765
Judy and the sea gods
have bequeathed upon us

00:56.848 --> 01:00.018
a big ol' bounty of our favorite drink,

01:00.101 --> 01:02.187
Brown Julien!

01:06.316 --> 01:07.817
Aah! Why?

01:07.901 --> 01:10.528
The supply of coffee beans that washed up

01:10.612 --> 01:12.864
with that shipwreck
nobody appeared to survive

01:12.947 --> 01:14.532
is so huge,

01:14.616 --> 01:19.412
we'll be drinking Brown Julien
for the rest... of our lives!

01:20.663 --> 01:24.459
Your Majesty, does the kingdom really need
this many Brown Julien kiosks?

01:24.542 --> 01:25.502
I don't know what you mean.

01:25.585 --> 01:28.213
Well, there's this one
and then that one

01:28.296 --> 01:30.048
and the one next door to that one

01:30.131 --> 01:32.467
and then the one you opened
inside the outhouse.

01:32.550 --> 01:34.093
-Aw, man!

01:34.177 --> 01:36.346
They never spell my name right.

01:36.429 --> 01:40.391
Expanding the Brown Julien empire
has been a dream of mine

01:40.475 --> 01:44.103
ever since I thought it up yesterday
while chugging too much Brown Julien.

01:44.187 --> 01:47.148
Ah, man, I love Brown Julien!

01:47.232 --> 01:48.691
I hate Brown Julien!

01:49.943 --> 01:50.860
I don't get it.

01:50.944 --> 01:53.363
I drink it all day. I drink it all night.

01:53.446 --> 01:55.406
But then when it's time
to go to beddy-bye...

01:55.490 --> 01:56.324
Kaboom!

01:56.407 --> 01:58.034
I'm wide awake,

01:58.118 --> 02:01.287
and I can hear my own shadow.

02:01.371 --> 02:02.539
Masikura!

02:02.622 --> 02:05.208
Ugh, you beckoned me, Your Majesty?

02:07.877 --> 02:10.797
Here, this should calm your stomach
and your nerves.

02:10.880 --> 02:11.714
No, thanks.

02:11.798 --> 02:13.550
Uh, coffee's the best drink
in the whole world.

02:13.633 --> 02:14.551
I-I...

02:18.888 --> 02:20.181
Bladow!

02:20.265 --> 02:23.351
That is... very calming.

02:23.434 --> 02:27.272
What do you call this golden beverage
that just made me rethink

02:27.355 --> 02:29.899
everything I ever knew about Brown Julien?

02:29.983 --> 02:31.734
It's called tea.

02:31.818 --> 02:32.819
Uh, okay.

02:32.902 --> 02:33.945
"T" what?

02:34.028 --> 02:35.363
Are you, like, spelling something?

02:35.446 --> 02:37.323
What are the other letters?
What are they?

02:37.407 --> 02:39.534
T-E-A.

02:39.617 --> 02:41.327
It was my grandmother's recipe.

02:41.411 --> 02:45.373
Made of flowers and roots and chamomile
and lavender and valerian,

02:45.456 --> 02:46.749
et cetera.

02:46.833 --> 02:49.252
Can definitely taste the et cetera.

02:49.335 --> 02:50.378
Real fresh.

02:50.461 --> 02:55.133
But a drink this delicious
deserves a better name.

02:56.509 --> 02:58.970
I dub this beverage... Golden Julien.

03:01.598 --> 03:04.350
Julien, Julien, Julien.

03:06.352 --> 03:09.731
Brown Julien is dead.

03:09.814 --> 03:12.567
-Golden Julien is the future.

03:12.650 --> 03:16.946
As you can see, we've got a bunch
of great Golden Julien locations

03:17.030 --> 03:19.115
popping up around town.

03:19.198 --> 03:21.618
Or should I say, "mom and popping up"?

03:22.619 --> 03:24.996
Oh, bamboo!

03:25.079 --> 03:27.999
Because Golden Julien is locally sourced

03:28.082 --> 03:30.960
and brewed right here in our village.

03:32.629 --> 03:36.341
Now, I invite you all to experience
Golden Julien.

03:37.800 --> 03:39.510
-All right, all right.

03:39.594 --> 03:41.221
Form an orderly queue!

03:41.304 --> 03:42.680
Oh, that's just great.
You're kidding.

03:43.723 --> 03:44.557
Ooh. Ow!

03:44.641 --> 03:46.559
Oh, y--oh, that's actually--
that's quite nice.

03:46.643 --> 03:47.602
Uh, peppermint in there.

03:47.685 --> 03:49.354
Is that? I think it is. Yeah, it is.

03:50.855 --> 03:52.273
I need my Golden Julien!

03:57.654 --> 03:58.988
Are you okay, Mort?

03:59.072 --> 04:01.950
"Okay"

04:02.033 --> 04:05.995
Can I be reduced to two letters
that define me?

04:06.079 --> 04:09.958
Uh, why is Mort talking
like a groovy '60s cult leader?

04:10.041 --> 04:11.709
Guess tea affects him differently.

04:11.793 --> 04:14.629
Society programs us, man.

04:14.712 --> 04:19.133
Like a robot escaping
from the mannequin factory, Jack.

04:19.217 --> 04:22.512
Oh, we got Jacks and Jills
and James and JoJos and JimJams...

04:22.595 --> 04:24.347
Let's make sure
you got some tranquilizer darts

04:24.430 --> 04:26.641
in case Mort gets any weirder.

04:26.724 --> 04:28.184
Locked and loaded.

04:28.268 --> 04:29.102
Mmm, mmm.

04:29.185 --> 04:33.439
It's like drinking a hug
from an emotionally distant parent.

04:33.523 --> 04:35.775
And my heart isn't getting
all freaky-deaky

04:35.858 --> 04:38.987
with the coffee palpitations
and the whatnot, man.

04:39.070 --> 04:40.321
Back and to the left.

04:40.405 --> 04:42.198

Gah! Karl?

05:20.111 --> 05:21.821
What's your deal, man?

05:21.904 --> 05:25.491
I have a proposition for you, Julien.

05:25.575 --> 05:28.161
Even if we weren't cuddling,
that statement would be creepy.

05:28.244 --> 05:32.206
I come on behalf of my family's
gourmet poo coffee empire,

05:32.290 --> 05:34.083
Brüs by Bruce.

05:34.167 --> 05:37.795
Nobody gives a poo
about your coffee anymore, Karl.

05:37.879 --> 05:41.007
My peeps are all about
that Golden Julien now.

05:41.090 --> 05:43.551
We'd like to buy your Golden Julien kiosks

05:43.634 --> 05:46.220
and expand your business even further.

05:46.304 --> 05:48.473
"Expand my business," huh?

05:48.556 --> 05:50.058
What's in it for me?

05:50.141 --> 05:54.187
Does this solid gold keytar
sweeten the deal?

05:54.270 --> 05:57.523
Yes!

05:58.524 --> 06:01.110
Maurice, look at all this architecture.

06:01.194 --> 06:04.113
It looks like a fancy prison.
We should do this in our kingdom.

06:04.197 --> 06:08.743
I'm not sure about this, Your Majesty.
I mean, Bruce is Karl's brother.

06:13.748 --> 06:15.083
Aah! Why?

06:16.167 --> 06:17.752
Bros, I'm stoked you're here.

06:17.835 --> 06:20.171
-So are Trent and Kipper.
-So stoked.

06:20.254 --> 06:21.297
What Trent said.

06:21.380 --> 06:22.715
Ugh, the dolphins.

06:22.799 --> 06:24.634
Darn those stupid dolphins.

06:25.635 --> 06:27.053
This place is sick!

06:27.136 --> 06:28.888
Coffee fountain! Masseuses!

06:28.971 --> 06:30.264
Ping-Pong that's just loud enough

06:30.348 --> 06:32.266
to make it impossible
to get any work done.

06:32.350 --> 06:34.393
Yeah, and peep all the expensive art I buy

06:34.477 --> 06:36.479
because the company
makes way too much money

06:36.562 --> 06:37.563
and hates charity.

06:37.647 --> 06:39.065
Nice.

06:41.192 --> 06:43.945
You agreed to remove this piece
from the lobby.

06:44.028 --> 06:45.571
Then I changed my mind.

06:45.655 --> 06:46.489
Know why?

06:46.572 --> 06:47.532
'Cause... this.

06:48.533 --> 06:49.617
Stop!

06:49.700 --> 06:53.121
Seriously, Bruce,
not in front of my archnemesis.

06:53.204 --> 06:54.038
-Ugh!

06:54.122 --> 06:55.915
Just messin' with you, little broski.

06:55.998 --> 06:57.458
Let's go check out the roasting room.

06:57.542 --> 06:59.293
Trent, Kipper. We rollin'.

06:59.377 --> 07:01.170
Kipper, could you imagine?

07:01.254 --> 07:03.381
The holy grail of babes.

07:03.464 --> 07:05.383
Half fish, half lady.

07:05.466 --> 07:07.051
"Half" to meet one someday.

07:07.135 --> 07:08.427
Trent, you're on fire, bro.

07:10.513 --> 07:14.267
Okay, now, Karl said
you had some business to discuss, so...

07:14.350 --> 07:16.060
This guy. I love it.

07:16.144 --> 07:17.562
"Hi, I'm Johnny Business School,

07:17.645 --> 07:19.355
and I want to talk
about spreadsheets and..."

07:21.732 --> 07:23.359
Aw, come on, don't make that face.

07:23.443 --> 07:24.902
-I'm just messing with ya.

07:24.986 --> 07:26.946
We do things a little different
at Brüs by Bruce.

07:27.947 --> 07:31.284
What my imbecile brother means is--

07:31.367 --> 07:32.660
Karl, pull my finger.

07:32.743 --> 07:33.578
Go on.

07:33.661 --> 07:34.787
Never mind. I'll do it myself.

07:39.876 --> 07:42.211
So Baron von Buzzkill
wants to talk bidness.

07:42.295 --> 07:43.129
Here it goes.

07:43.212 --> 07:44.422
The structure here is simple.

07:44.505 --> 07:47.008
Trent and Kipper are our Chairmen
of Distribution and Sales.

07:47.091 --> 07:49.135
Me? I'm the Chairman of Chairmen.

07:49.218 --> 07:52.054
I'm also CEO, CFO, CTO,

07:52.138 --> 07:55.391
BMOC, TGIF, LOL, MSG,

07:55.475 --> 07:57.310
and DJ at company picnics.

07:57.393 --> 07:59.187
And Karl is

07:59.270 --> 08:01.022
Just kidding. Don't answer that.
Nobody cares.

08:02.023 --> 08:05.443
We want Golden Julien
to be part of the Brüs by Bruce fam.

08:05.526 --> 08:07.945
We don't want you to sell out.
We want you to cash in.

08:08.029 --> 08:09.822
Well, Bruce, you've given us...

08:09.906 --> 08:10.781
...a lot to think about.

08:12.742 --> 08:13.826
-Mmm.
-Uh...

08:13.910 --> 08:15.912
What's that

08:15.995 --> 08:17.371
"Oh, you guys got a nacho bar?

08:17.455 --> 08:18.456
That's sick, bro!"

08:18.539 --> 08:20.166
Ooh, I know, bro.

08:20.249 --> 08:22.251
Your Majesty,
uh, we should talk this over.

08:23.669 --> 08:25.213
Maurice! Nacho bar!

08:25.296 --> 08:27.215
Give you a nacho bar.

08:27.298 --> 08:30.259
Hey, Patrick, you mind giving Maurice
a tour of the facilities

08:30.343 --> 08:32.637
while I handle my biz
with my new best friend?

08:32.720 --> 08:35.264
-Uh-huh.
-I'm not leaving King Julien.

08:35.348 --> 08:36.349
It's fine, bud.

08:36.432 --> 08:37.892
We'll catch up later. Nachos!

08:37.975 --> 08:39.310
Ready for the board meeting?

08:39.393 --> 08:40.561
Karl, you're drivin'.

08:44.607 --> 08:46.692
This is a board meeting?

08:46.776 --> 08:48.569
Yeah, wakeboard meeting.

08:48.653 --> 08:50.905
Where else would we have it,
some lame conference room?

08:52.532 --> 08:54.659
When you're rolling
with the Brüs by Bruce crew,

08:54.742 --> 08:58.037
we're shredding wakes
and taking names every day.

08:58.120 --> 08:58.955
Mm!

08:59.038 --> 08:59.872
Ha ha!

08:59.956 --> 09:02.291
I could get used to this.

09:02.375 --> 09:05.336
Hey, should we, uh, check on Maurice?

09:05.419 --> 09:06.754
I'm sure he's fine.

09:06.837 --> 09:08.673
As you can see,

09:08.756 --> 09:12.051
-we have a variety of roasts.

09:12.134 --> 09:16.514
Dark roast, extra-dark roast,

09:16.597 --> 09:18.057
-medium-dark roast.

09:18.140 --> 09:19.892
What are we doing in this room

09:19.976 --> 09:22.103
of fancy glass eggs?

09:22.186 --> 09:24.522
Some days it's just nice
to come in here and unwind

09:24.605 --> 09:26.774
by destroying
some priceless collector's items.

09:26.857 --> 09:27.984
It's very therapeutic.

09:28.067 --> 09:28.901
Really?

09:28.985 --> 09:30.403
You tell me.

09:30.486 --> 09:32.655
-Ooh, that's the stuff.

09:34.574 --> 09:35.658
Oh, baby!

09:42.164 --> 09:45.126
Dude! That's superstar DJ Deceased Rabbit.

09:45.209 --> 09:46.460
How did you get him?

09:46.544 --> 09:49.672
Three words--money, money, money.

09:49.755 --> 09:53.342
The worthless pieces of paper
with dead politicians' faces on it?

09:53.426 --> 09:56.554
Yeah, it's all the rage with these dumb,
hairless apes called humans.

09:56.637 --> 09:59.223
They trade it to us for coffee,
and then we trade it for other stuff,

09:59.307 --> 10:00.933
like boats and samurai swords

10:01.017 --> 10:03.519
and expanding our coffee empire
by crushing all the competition.

10:03.603 --> 10:04.895
Samurai swords!

10:04.979 --> 10:08.149
Where do I sign?

10:14.530 --> 10:15.698
Hey, buddy, guess what.

10:15.781 --> 10:18.701
I just signed a contract
that'll have us up to our eyeballs

10:18.784 --> 10:21.537
in samurai swords and free nachos.

10:21.621 --> 10:22.830
Did you read it first?

10:22.913 --> 10:24.749
Read what first?

10:24.832 --> 10:26.167
Oh, the contract? Nope.

10:26.250 --> 10:27.418
But Bruce is cool.

10:27.501 --> 10:30.296
And when has a cool person
ever been a jerk?

10:30.379 --> 10:31.631
-We just get each other.

10:31.714 --> 10:32.548
Totally.

10:32.632 --> 10:35.301
For the first time ever,
I feel like I have a brother.

10:35.384 --> 10:37.553
I'm your brother, Bruce.

10:37.637 --> 10:38.512
Exactly.

10:38.596 --> 10:42.099
Hey, bros, who wants to check out
the indoor ski slope?

10:42.183 --> 10:44.769
King Julien,
I think we should think this through.

10:44.852 --> 10:45.686
I don't!

10:47.313 --> 10:48.939
Whoosh. Whoosh. Whoosh.

10:56.364 --> 10:59.867
Looks like Bruce replaced every single
Golden Julien kiosk in the kingdom.

10:59.950 --> 11:00.951
Except that one.

11:01.035 --> 11:02.203
Hey there, Jack.

11:02.286 --> 11:04.330
I need a cup of that sweet, sweet Golden--

11:06.957 --> 11:09.835
Bruce told me
he didn't want to change anything

11:09.919 --> 11:11.087
about Golden Julien.

11:12.088 --> 11:13.839
Maybe you should have read the fine print

11:13.923 --> 11:16.258
or at least waited
till I read the dang fine print

11:16.342 --> 11:17.385
before you signed it!

11:17.468 --> 11:20.304
Yeah, but if I can't trust a corporate CEO

11:20.388 --> 11:23.140
to do the right thing, who can I trust?

11:23.224 --> 11:25.142
Why did you do this?

11:25.226 --> 11:26.227
Do what?

11:26.310 --> 11:28.229
You outlawed Golden Julien.

11:28.312 --> 11:29.814
Clover!

11:29.897 --> 11:31.524
When did I outlaw Golden Julien?

11:31.607 --> 11:33.859
Uh, as soon as you signed that contract,
Your Majesty,

11:33.943 --> 11:36.487
and Bruce started installing
his giant megastores.

11:36.570 --> 11:38.906
If Maurice had done his job,

11:38.989 --> 11:40.783
you would have known
that the paper you signed

11:40.866 --> 11:42.785
also included a royal decree

11:42.868 --> 11:45.287
banning Golden Julien from the kingdom

11:45.371 --> 11:47.748
so it doesn't cut
into Bruce's coffee profits.

11:47.832 --> 11:50.543
-I've already begun enforcing the new law.

11:50.626 --> 11:52.670
Oi! Freeze!

11:52.753 --> 11:54.630
-Run away!

11:58.717 --> 12:01.595

12:01.679 --> 12:03.806
-Hey!

12:06.100 --> 12:07.393
-What the--come on!
-Hey!

12:07.476 --> 12:10.062
Maurice, how could you let this happen?

12:10.146 --> 12:11.439
Hmm? I didn't!

12:11.522 --> 12:13.899
You sent me on a boring tour
of the doo-doo coffee factory while you were breaking fancy antiques
with nunchucks.

12:16.444 --> 12:19.363
Okay, maybe it's not as bad
as it seems, though.

12:19.447 --> 12:22.324
Maybe everyone will be too happy
to have coffee back

12:22.408 --> 12:25.619
that they won't even notice
that Golden Julien is illegal.

12:25.703 --> 12:28.456
Bring back Golden Julien!

12:28.539 --> 12:31.333
It appears we are in a bit of a pickle.

12:31.417 --> 12:32.460
Truth be told,

12:32.543 --> 12:36.422

13:16.879 --> 13:19.715

13:19.798 --> 13:21.675
part of the contract I signed

13:21.759 --> 13:23.802
would outlaw Golden Julien

13:23.886 --> 13:26.055

13:26.138 --> 13:28.224

21:02.135 --> 21:02.970
Any ideas?

21:03.053 --> 21:05.347
Cover your ears
and watch out for shrapnel.

21:05.430 --> 21:09.101
And you guys might want
to start updating your résumés.

21:09.184 --> 21:11.395
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
we're way too close to the--

21:21.613 --> 21:23.573
Let us abscond! Quickly!

21:25.867 --> 21:27.911
Aw, nah.

21:27.995 --> 21:30.789
Brah!

21:30.872 --> 21:33.750
Thank you again, my old adversary,

21:33.834 --> 21:36.837
for being a pawn in my master plan.

21:36.920 --> 21:38.630
Your master plan?

21:38.714 --> 21:42.050
I realized the only way
I could ever properly defeat Bruce

21:42.134 --> 21:45.679
and destroy his business
is through partnering him with Julien.

21:45.762 --> 21:48.432
-Uh...
-We almost got blown up by dynamite, man!

21:48.515 --> 21:51.059
Hmm.

21:51.143 --> 21:54.104
Until next time, Julien-ites.

21:55.564 --> 21:58.233
Okay, is it just me,
or is that guy the worst?

21:58.317 --> 22:00.235
Okay, our first order of business,

22:00.319 --> 22:03.322
we figure out a way to get rid
of all of Bruce's megastores.

22:03.405 --> 22:05.532
Did somebody say "dynamite"?

22:05.615 --> 22:06.450
-No!

22:09.077 --> 22:10.495
I imagine there's some sort of lesson

22:10.579 --> 22:11.955
in there somewhere, Your Majesty.

22:12.039 --> 22:12.956
Yeah.

22:13.040 --> 22:15.292
It's not my job to make stuff illegal

22:15.375 --> 22:18.670
just so it benefits business dudes
who bribe me.

22:18.754 --> 22:22.424
From now on, folks can drink
whatever beverages they want.

22:22.507 --> 22:25.761
Heck, we could even open up a milk shop
around the corner.

22:25.844 --> 22:27.345
I mean, if that's what my peoples want.

22:27.429 --> 22:29.973
Maybe we can just
leave the business and retail stuff

22:30.057 --> 22:32.392
to guys like Bruce from now on.

22:32.476 --> 22:33.769
Poo coffee.

22:33.852 --> 22:35.395
Who wants my poo coffee?

22:35.479 --> 22:36.980
-Warm and fresh.

22:37.064 --> 22:39.149
Anybody?
