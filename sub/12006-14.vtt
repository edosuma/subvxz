Getting a woman's number

00:19.189 --> 00:20.838
probably not the smoothest of moves.

00:20.839 --> 00:22.140
_

00:22.159 --> 00:24.927
I was thinking about casting a wider net.

00:25.028 --> 00:26.795
- Really?
- Applying to a few schools

00:26.896 --> 00:28.864
that have a strong premed program.

00:28.966 --> 00:30.666
Premed.

00:31.708 --> 00:34.109
I got hit by another Sarah Lazar bomb.

00:34.210 --> 00:37.045
- Not her again.
- She's suing to keep my book from coming out.

00:37.146 --> 00:39.614
Sarah, why are you trying
to sabotage my career?

00:39.715 --> 00:40.882
I didn't make up lies about you,

00:40.983 --> 00:43.051
and I will be damned if I sit back

00:43.152 --> 00:44.786
while you make them up about me.

00:44.887 --> 00:48.456
These schools have the
best premed programs.

00:48.557 --> 00:50.725
That's a fancy list.

00:50.827 --> 00:54.830
And this is how much each of them costs.

00:54.931 --> 00:58.733
<i>- (Kettle whistles)

00:58.834 --> 01:01.135

01:04.373 --> 01:05.940

01:06.041 --> 01:09.310
Hmm, Gallaudet's looking better and better.

01:09.411 --> 01:10.845
I know.

01:10.946 --> 01:13.514
Am I crazy for even
applying to these schools?

01:13.615 --> 01:15.450
No, it's good to aim high.

01:15.551 --> 01:16.917
The tricky part is...

01:17.018 --> 01:18.152
Paying for it.

01:20.422 --> 01:23.357
I put some money aside for you.

01:23.458 --> 01:25.726
But to be honest,

01:25.827 --> 01:26.926
I don't think it's gonna

01:27.027 --> 01:28.829
be enough to even cover one semester.

01:30.498 --> 01:31.665
I feel silly.

01:31.766 --> 01:32.999
Don't.

01:33.100 --> 01:34.668
If this is what you want,

01:34.769 --> 01:36.536
we'll find a way.

Not yet. I like... flying under the radar.

she would like us here

Uh-oh.

What does she want now?

04:10.554 --> 04:12.254
Actually, I called her.

04:12.355 --> 04:15.090
I want to tell her that
I heard her concerns

04:15.191 --> 04:16.892

and we both know is her?

a little more noble,

04:24.166 --> 04:25.500

04:25.601 --> 04:27.502
You can do that on the phone.

04:27.603 --> 04:29.070
Mm... (Gulps)

04:29.171 --> 04:30.539
But maybe she'll call off her lawyer

04:30.640 --> 04:32.641
if she can see how sorry I am.

04:32.742 --> 04:35.491
Could you hand me the
antacid tablets over there?

04:35.500 --> 04:36.778
That bad, huh?

04:36.879 --> 04:39.014
Yeah, my stomach's in knots.

04:41.282 --> 04:43.918
I thought this book was
supposed to be a fun romp.

04:44.019 --> 04:45.686
Maybe reading it will be,

04:45.787 --> 04:48.789
but writing it is giving me an ulcer.

04:50.792 --> 04:53.160
Madison, Wisconsin?

04:53.261 --> 04:54.361
When?

04:54.462 --> 04:56.096
Like, soon.

04:56.197 --> 04:57.731
She was talking about taking...

04:57.832 --> 05:00.601
Emmet and Travis out of school.

05:00.702 --> 05:02.836
Emmet wouldn't go, right?

05:02.938 --> 05:05.539
I mean, he would just stay with his dad

05:05.639 --> 05:07.574
like it's one of those weekends.

05:07.675 --> 05:09.476
He doesn't stay there on the weekends.

05:09.577 --> 05:11.911
But he would if he had to, right?

05:12.012 --> 05:13.913
I mean, instead of moving to Wisconsin?

05:14.014 --> 05:16.383
Cameron lives with his
girlfriend Debbie now.

05:16.484 --> 05:18.285
But she's cool, right?

05:18.386 --> 05:19.686
(Stutters) I bet she's cool.

05:19.787 --> 05:21.488
I've never met her.

05:21.589 --> 05:22.956
Okay, even if she's a wicked witch,

05:23.057 --> 05:26.359
it's only a few months until we graduate.

05:26.461 --> 05:29.662
Emmet can swing it till then, right?

05:34.634 --> 05:37.103
What's "The Empowering Success Award"?

05:37.204 --> 05:39.505
It's a scholarship

05:39.606 --> 05:42.174
for "differently-abled" students.

05:42.275 --> 05:44.710
I'm looking for help to pay for college.

05:44.811 --> 05:48.880
Um, "J" and "K" are right next door.

05:49.916 --> 05:51.484
They're paying for mine.

05:51.585 --> 05:54.720
I can't ask them for thousands of dollars.

05:54.821 --> 05:57.188
Why not? You're they're daughter too.

05:57.289 --> 06:01.159
They bought you a car for
your birthday, remember?

06:01.260 --> 06:03.495
Yeah, a car is one thing.

06:03.596 --> 06:05.831
But four years of college tuition?

06:05.932 --> 06:07.599
Is the next...

06:07.700 --> 06:10.535
parental obligation.

06:10.637 --> 06:13.438
Maybe a senior trip to Cancun first.

06:13.539 --> 06:15.173
- (Chuckles)
- Look,

06:15.274 --> 06:17.775
Toby's not using his college fund.

06:17.876 --> 06:21.946
And not to sound like
a spoiled Buckner brat,

06:22.047 --> 06:25.415
but "J" and "K" can swing it.

06:27.185 --> 06:29.120

06:38.396 --> 06:39.630

07:01.493 --> 07:03.830

07:04.055 --> 07:06.756

_

07:11.628 --> 07:12.896

07:13.898 --> 07:16.032

07:20.403 --> 07:21.636

07:43.594 --> 07:45.394
Ugh! Come on!

Emmet!

07:47.130 --> 07:49.631
Your dad would love to see you.

07:49.732 --> 07:53.301
And besides, I've never met Debbie and...

07:53.402 --> 07:55.337
I think it might be time

07:55.438 --> 07:58.373
to tell everybody that we're back together.

07:59.131 --> 08:02.174
_

08:02.378 --> 08:03.478
I changed my mind.

08:04.844 --> 08:07.090

08:07.216 --> 08:09.718
That's fine. Okay. Just an hour.

08:09.719 --> 08:11.000

08:11.005 --> 08:13.955
Yay, we're going to a party.

08:15.523 --> 08:17.058

- Thanks for coming over.

08:17.159 --> 08:18.926
- Well, it sounded serious.
- It is,

08:19.027 --> 08:20.461
but in a good way. Have a seat.

08:20.562 --> 08:21.595
<i>John: Yeah, please.</i>

08:21.696 --> 08:23.765
Have a seat. Great. So...

08:23.866 --> 08:25.699
college is coming up fast for the girls.

08:25.801 --> 08:27.635
And Kathryn and I were talking.

08:27.736 --> 08:29.904
We would like to pay

08:30.005 --> 08:30.972
for Daphne's school.

08:31.073 --> 08:33.640
Did she say something to you?

08:33.741 --> 08:35.609
- No.
- No, Bay did.

08:35.710 --> 08:38.711
Apparently, Daphne doesn't
feel comfortable asking us,

08:38.813 --> 08:40.546
<i>- so...
- (Sighs)</i>

08:40.648 --> 08:42.649
First of all, thank you.

08:43.650 --> 08:45.285
<i>Kathryn: It's not like... </i>

08:45.386 --> 08:47.654
a credit card or paying for their car.

08:47.755 --> 08:51.024
I know, and I would be lying if I said

08:51.125 --> 08:52.425
that I wasn't tempted.

08:52.526 --> 08:53.894
Great.

08:53.995 --> 08:55.796
Is there a problem?

08:56.831 --> 08:58.865
Daphne is going premed now,

08:58.966 --> 09:00.566
which means four years of college

09:00.668 --> 09:02.735
plus four more of med school.

09:02.837 --> 09:05.637
We're talking hundreds
of thousands of dollars.

09:05.738 --> 09:08.373
Well, it's an investment
in her future, so...

09:08.474 --> 09:11.010
Look, Toby's college fund
is just sitting there.

09:11.111 --> 09:12.044
And we have other assets.

09:12.145 --> 09:14.847
Okay, so you can afford it.

09:16.349 --> 09:17.950
It still doesn't address my other concern.

09:18.051 --> 09:19.418
Which is?

09:21.621 --> 09:24.155
I taught Daphne if it's worth having,

09:24.256 --> 09:25.957
it's worth effort and sacrifice.

09:26.058 --> 09:28.226
Giving her a blank check for college

09:28.328 --> 09:30.195
is the opposite of that.

09:30.296 --> 09:31.496
We're supposed to provide for her.

09:31.597 --> 09:33.231
- She's our daughter.
- We're supposed

09:33.333 --> 09:35.934
to teach her to be responsible for herself.

09:36.035 --> 09:37.703
So we're spoiling Bay

09:37.804 --> 09:38.937
by paying for her college?

09:40.540 --> 09:42.207
(Sighs)

09:42.308 --> 09:45.711
Well, if I had a say, which I don't,

09:45.812 --> 09:49.348
I would say yes, a little.

09:49.449 --> 09:51.782
I think our kids understand

09:51.883 --> 09:54.318
that they are lucky to
have their college paid for.

09:54.419 --> 09:56.687
Well, I think it creates
kids who are entitled.

09:56.788 --> 09:59.189
I don't think it should
all just be handed to them

09:59.290 --> 10:01.191
- on a silver platter.
- John: Well, we admire

10:01.292 --> 10:03.594
your commitment to your principles, Regina,

10:03.695 --> 10:04.895
but you're being unreasonable.

10:07.766 --> 10:09.967
I appreciate the offer,

10:10.068 --> 10:11.301
but at least for Daphne,

10:11.403 --> 10:12.503
no, thank you.

10:29.225 --> 10:31.794
So before we go to the museum...

10:33.062 --> 10:35.264
I was wondering if you'd mind

10:35.365 --> 10:39.167
if we stopped by Cameron's
housewarming party.

10:39.268 --> 10:40.635
It's on the way.

10:41.106 --> 10:43.020

10:43.021 --> 10:43.701
Yeah.

10:47.376 --> 10:49.877
No, I'm inviting you...

10:50.979 --> 10:52.514
as my date.

10:55.496 --> 10:57.519
(Laughs) No, it's not.

10:57.620 --> 10:58.820
It's not.

10:58.921 --> 11:00.188
He gave me your number, remember?

11:01.423 --> 11:03.090
Come on, we pop in,

11:03.192 --> 11:04.859
I'll give him a bottle of wine.

11:04.960 --> 11:07.962
We'll say, "hey, nice countertops,"

11:08.063 --> 11:09.630
and then we'll pop out.

11:11.200 --> 11:14.068
Look, I'm always going
to these things alone.

11:14.169 --> 11:15.636
It would be so nice

11:15.737 --> 11:17.972
to have a plus-one for a change.

11:21.210 --> 11:24.846
A gorgeous plus-one.

11:26.848 --> 11:28.248
Awesome.

11:35.056 --> 11:37.591
Hey, is it okay if Sharee comes over later?

11:37.692 --> 11:39.326
I want to do some practice S.A.T. stuff.

11:39.427 --> 11:42.295
Sure, do you know about the
Kansas Latina Merit Award?

11:42.397 --> 11:43.864
It's worth $25,000.

11:43.965 --> 11:46.199
Yeah, they're interviewing
at Carlton this weekend.

11:46.300 --> 11:48.468
- You applied, right?
- No.

11:48.569 --> 11:50.036
Why not?

11:50.137 --> 11:51.804
- Mom.
- You are latina

11:51.906 --> 11:53.840
because that is the
culture you were raised in.

11:55.109 --> 11:56.642
Well, it's too late now.

11:56.744 --> 11:58.511
I don't know. Who at Carlton

11:58.612 --> 11:59.880
is overseeing the interviews?

11:59.981 --> 12:02.048
- Ms. Summers.
- Is she hearing?

12:02.149 --> 12:04.284
- Yeah.
- I'm gonna call her.

12:04.385 --> 12:06.152
If I got an interview,
I know I could nail it.

12:06.254 --> 12:07.287
Let's see.

Hi, Gabe. Melody!

12:35.481 --> 12:36.948
What a surprise.

Did you see who else is here?

12:41.287 --> 12:42.788
(Chuckles)

12:43.923 --> 12:45.657
Aren't these two so cute?

12:47.460 --> 12:49.027
So glad you could make it.

12:49.128 --> 12:50.796
Oh.

12:50.897 --> 12:53.263
This is for you guys.

13:30.099 --> 13:32.180
If you're miserable, we can leave.

13:32.181 --> 13:34.841

13:34.854 --> 13:35.838
Okay.

You know that barbeque
place that you love so much?

Yes, and guess who's gonna be there.

Yes.

14:12.007 --> 14:13.057
_

14:13.114 --> 14:14.841
He said so on Twitter.

14:14.942 --> 14:18.912
He said that he's dying for
some K.C. barbecue from Al's.

14:19.014 --> 14:20.847
- No way!
- Yes. (Laughs)

14:20.848 --> 14:23.574

14:31.026 --> 14:32.393
but it is so much fun.

14:32.494 --> 14:33.627
Do you ride with Cameron?

14:33.728 --> 14:34.728
He's tried to get me

14:34.829 --> 14:36.496
- on the bike, but...
- Oh, you should do it.

14:36.597 --> 14:37.631
In fact,

14:37.732 --> 14:39.933
we should all go for a ride together,

14:40.034 --> 14:41.467
right, Emmet?

14:41.569 --> 14:44.004
I mean, not on the same bike.

14:44.104 --> 14:45.271
(Laughs)

14:45.372 --> 14:47.073
I think I would just be
too nervous to enjoy it.

14:47.174 --> 14:49.142
Well, we could do something else.

14:49.243 --> 14:50.944
Oh, uh, game night.

14:51.045 --> 14:53.346
Emmet loves Monopoly.

14:53.447 --> 14:55.681
We could order some takeout,

14:55.782 --> 14:59.352
- switch up the teams.
- Now that sounds like fun.

14:59.453 --> 15:02.088
Well, how about next Wednesday?

15:02.189 --> 15:04.057
- Are you guys free then?
- I'm check with Cam.

15:06.293 --> 15:09.128
Uh, oh, okay, great.
This really has been fun.

16:42.308 --> 16:44.977

16:50.784 --> 16:52.617

16:52.718 --> 16:55.754
the newlyweds, Cameron and Debbie.

<i>(Applause, cheers)</i>

17:09.036 --> 17:10.368
<i>Kathryn: So I talked to the editor</i>

17:10.470 --> 17:12.137
<i>about deepening the sports reporter</i>

17:12.239 --> 17:14.071
<i>and making her motives more complex.</i>

17:14.174 --> 17:16.074
Look, I even pitched making
the character a man...

17:16.175 --> 17:18.176
a failed baseball player

17:18.278 --> 17:19.778
who never made it to the major leagues...

17:19.878 --> 17:21.547
but she would not let me.

17:21.647 --> 17:24.183
So whose name's gonna be on the
front of the book? Hers or yours?

17:24.284 --> 17:26.484
- She seemed really adamant.
- She's bullying you.

17:26.586 --> 17:28.420
- Sarah.
- Look, it's my reputation.

17:28.521 --> 17:31.289
I hear you, but I really tried.

17:32.924 --> 17:34.459
All right.

17:36.695 --> 17:38.696
So are you gonna keep
going with your lawsuit?

17:38.797 --> 17:41.366
That depends on your reaction

17:41.467 --> 17:43.034
to what I'm about to tell you.

17:43.135 --> 17:45.503
There's a TV movie being made from my book

17:45.604 --> 17:47.038
about your daughters being switched.

17:47.139 --> 17:49.473
- A movie about my family?
- Not exactly.

17:49.574 --> 17:52.042
It's fiction inspired by my book.

17:52.143 --> 17:53.843
Wait, it's already been made?

17:53.944 --> 17:56.146
Not yet, but there's a script.

17:56.247 --> 17:57.881
I want to show it to you.

17:59.016 --> 18:00.150
Who's gonna play me?

18:00.251 --> 18:02.252
(Chuckles)

18:02.353 --> 18:04.555
I would ask the exact same thing.

18:04.656 --> 18:05.789
(Awkward laugh)

18:05.890 --> 18:07.991
Consider the lawsuit dropped.

18:10.294 --> 18:11.394
Thank you.

18:13.830 --> 18:17.633
So do you really think that I'm
letting my editor railroad me?

18:17.634 --> 18:19.235
You're a new writer. It's a mistake

18:19.336 --> 18:20.936
everyone makes when they first start out.

18:21.037 --> 18:23.172
You feel lucky that you have a deal,

18:23.273 --> 18:25.174
so you're terrified to rock the boat.

18:25.275 --> 18:26.542
But from my experience,

18:26.643 --> 18:28.611
I think that they'd respect you more

18:28.712 --> 18:30.245
when you have a point of view.

18:30.346 --> 18:32.347
You now what's best for your book.

18:32.448 --> 18:34.116
You live and die by your own choices.

18:36.519 --> 18:37.720
(Sighs)

18:37.821 --> 18:40.288
I guess you can see I
feel strongly about this.

18:41.357 --> 18:45.227
Hey, will you stick
around while I call her?

18:47.162 --> 18:48.830
Hell yeah.

18:48.931 --> 18:50.297
"D," are you sure?

18:50.398 --> 18:54.335
Yeah, maudlin means very sentimental.

18:54.436 --> 18:56.904
(Sighs) I wish this test was all math.

18:57.006 --> 18:58.172
Yeah, me too.

18:58.273 --> 19:00.274
You want to do a timed practice test?

19:00.375 --> 19:02.543
I can't. I have to be
at Carlton in an hour.

19:02.645 --> 19:04.378
On a Saturday? What for?

19:04.479 --> 19:07.849
I'm interviewing for the
Kansas Latina Merit Award.

19:07.950 --> 19:10.450
(Laughs) Excuse me, you're not latina.

19:10.551 --> 19:12.052
My last name is Vasquez.

19:12.153 --> 19:13.486
But you're supposed to be a Kennish,

19:13.587 --> 19:15.188
like Toby, right?

19:15.289 --> 19:17.290
Well, I didn't know that for 16 years.

19:17.391 --> 19:19.559
I grew up Puerto Rican
with a Puerto Rican mom

19:19.661 --> 19:20.727
and a Puerto Rican name.

19:20.828 --> 19:23.130
But when people look at
you, they see a white girl.

19:23.230 --> 19:25.999
Not in East Riverside.
People knew me there.

19:26.100 --> 19:27.834
But in the rest of the world,

19:27.935 --> 19:29.803
if you walk into a store with a big coat on

19:29.904 --> 19:33.040
and some girl with dark hair and dark skin

19:33.141 --> 19:34.440
walks into a store with a big coat on,

19:34.542 --> 19:36.242
you're not gonna have 10 sales people

19:36.343 --> 19:38.244
follow you around. She will.

19:38.345 --> 19:40.079
But that's about skin color,

19:40.181 --> 19:42.348
not about being latina.

19:42.449 --> 19:45.585
Some latinas are blonde, some are redheads.

19:45.686 --> 19:47.853
But what I'm saying is
you're not even that.

19:47.954 --> 19:49.522
You're not latina.

19:49.623 --> 19:51.724
According to who?

19:54.295 --> 19:55.728
What do you want me to say?

19:57.231 --> 19:58.764
If you were me,

19:58.865 --> 19:59.932
would you have applied for the scholarship?

20:00.033 --> 20:02.535
Yes, because I need all
the breaks I can get.

20:02.636 --> 20:04.437
Your dad, he's a state senator

20:04.538 --> 20:06.438
and you live in Mission Hills.

20:06.539 --> 20:09.075
- What breaks do you need?
- But that's not me...

20:09.176 --> 20:11.744
Mission Hills, rich white person.

20:11.845 --> 20:15.247
That's not who I am, not inside.

20:15.348 --> 20:19.185
Even if it's... what I should have been.

20:21.588 --> 20:23.255
Then do what you got to do.

20:42.241 --> 20:43.341
<i>Debbie: You found our secret.</i>

20:43.442 --> 20:44.843
I was...

20:44.944 --> 20:47.212
just looking for the bathroom.

20:47.312 --> 20:51.382
- Across the hall.
- So are you... ?

20:52.751 --> 20:54.351
- Four months.
- (Sighs)

20:54.452 --> 20:57.020
Wow, you are just full of surprises today.

20:57.122 --> 21:00.090
Uh... congratulations.

21:00.191 --> 21:02.793
Thank you, we're so excited.

21:02.894 --> 21:04.594
I'm gonna go find Emmet. Uh...

21:04.695 --> 21:06.529
Please don't tell him.

21:07.832 --> 21:09.633
Cameron wants to.

21:12.336 --> 21:13.670
Of course.

21:20.697 --> 21:22.076
Characters evolve.

21:22.850 --> 21:26.530
And characters evolve as the story does...

21:26.631 --> 21:28.599
For the better, in my opinion.

21:28.700 --> 21:30.400
You're the writer.

21:30.502 --> 21:32.302
Uh... uh, yeah.

21:32.403 --> 21:34.939
I understand, but, um, I'm the writer

21:35.039 --> 21:36.606
and I need to have the liberty

21:36.707 --> 21:38.808
to tell the story and make changes.

21:38.909 --> 21:41.911
(Whispers) You cannot compromise
your artistic integrity!

21:42.012 --> 21:44.848
Uh-huh, Lydia, I want to
sell a lot of books too,

21:44.949 --> 21:47.116
but I don't want to compromise

21:47.217 --> 21:49.452
my artistic integrity to do it.

21:49.553 --> 21:51.420
Nice.

21:51.522 --> 21:53.823
<i>Wh... okay, fine!</i>

21:53.924 --> 21:56.392
If you think you can
find another baseball wife

21:56.493 --> 21:59.060
who can write this book, then be my guest.

21:59.161 --> 22:00.629
No, no, no, no.

22:02.298 --> 22:04.165
Oh.

22:04.266 --> 22:05.467
Okay.

22:05.568 --> 22:07.536
<i>You too.</i>

22:07.637 --> 22:09.437
Goodbye.

22:11.073 --> 22:12.808
What did she say?

22:12.909 --> 22:15.410
- She said yes.
- She did?

22:16.546 --> 22:19.046
Ah! I thought for sure you got fired.

22:19.147 --> 22:20.882
(Laughs) She said she saw my point.

22:20.983 --> 22:22.717
(Laughs) Nicely played.

22:22.818 --> 22:24.218
- (Both laughs)
- That felt awesome!

22:24.319 --> 22:25.987
Let me buy you a drink.

22:26.087 --> 22:27.822
No, let me buy you a drink.

22:27.923 --> 22:28.923
- Okay, deal.

22:30.225 --> 22:31.526
Hi, Ms. Summers.

22:31.627 --> 22:33.694
Ah, Daphne, our late addition.

22:33.795 --> 22:35.429
(Chuckles) Thanks for your help.

22:35.531 --> 22:37.331
Because we added you last minute,

22:37.432 --> 22:39.866
I'm gonna be your
interpreter for the interview.

22:39.967 --> 22:42.769
Oh, well, that's okay. I don't need one.

22:42.870 --> 22:44.538
Are you sure?

22:44.639 --> 22:45.605
Well, if you change your mind,

22:45.706 --> 22:47.841
- I'll be right here.
- Thanks.

22:47.942 --> 22:49.809
It's "Vasquez," right?

22:49.911 --> 22:51.044
Take a seat.

22:51.145 --> 22:52.378
She's running a little bit behind.

22:52.479 --> 22:53.713
Thanks.

23:16.269 --> 23:17.835
He hasn't tweeted anything,

23:17.937 --> 23:19.971
but maybe practice went long.

23:19.972 --> 23:23.690
_

23:23.693 --> 23:27.244
How does that work, him playing in the NFL?

23:27.345 --> 23:29.747
Like, how does he know about his signals,

23:29.848 --> 23:32.050
the whistles, and that stuff?

23:32.051 --> 23:38.170

23:38.176 --> 23:39.590
Oh, that's so cool.

23:57.823 --> 23:58.975

24:14.858 --> 24:17.660
Uh, h... have you seen her recently?

24:19.100 --> 24:23.474

24:23.533 --> 24:25.167
Does she know about me?

24:29.372 --> 24:30.539
Do you ever miss her?

24:31.440 --> 24:34.075
_

24:34.344 --> 24:36.145
I'm just curious.

25:09.211 --> 25:10.545
Yes.

25:11.613 --> 25:13.847
Your grades are excellent

25:13.948 --> 25:15.849
and it looks like you're a real leader.

25:15.950 --> 25:17.985
Thank you.

25:18.086 --> 25:20.054
Carlton was great for me.

25:20.155 --> 25:23.624
I never felt different
or limited by my deafness,

25:23.725 --> 25:25.259
'cause everyone was deaf.

25:25.360 --> 25:28.496
And what about outside of Carlton?

25:28.597 --> 25:30.030
Has your deafness limited you?

25:30.131 --> 25:32.165
Sometimes.

25:32.266 --> 25:35.602
People see hearing aides or see you signing

25:35.703 --> 25:37.604
and they think something's wrong with you

25:37.705 --> 25:39.439
or they feel sorry for you.

25:39.540 --> 25:42.875
When I tried to get a job
at a kitchen one summer,

25:42.976 --> 25:45.512
I kept getting turned down
when I said I was deaf.

25:45.613 --> 25:48.147
Can you think of a time where you felt

25:48.249 --> 25:50.983
similar discrimination
because you're latina?

25:51.085 --> 25:52.885
(Inhales)

25:53.887 --> 25:55.689
It's okay. Take your time.

25:59.292 --> 26:00.526
(Exhales)

26:01.728 --> 26:02.994
Sorry.

26:04.797 --> 26:06.532
This scholarship was started

26:06.633 --> 26:10.102
to help girls who had been
overlooked or passed over

26:10.203 --> 26:12.471
because they're latina.

26:14.807 --> 26:16.675
So I'm not latina

26:16.776 --> 26:18.777
if I haven't been a victim because of it.

26:18.878 --> 26:20.646
I'm not saying that.

26:20.747 --> 26:22.715
We're not celebrating victimhood.

26:22.815 --> 26:25.784
Being Puerto Rican is
a big part of who I am.

26:25.885 --> 26:27.353
I believe you.

26:27.454 --> 26:30.122
This is not an ethnicity test.

26:30.223 --> 26:32.724
If I'm being honest,

26:32.825 --> 26:35.794
I'm glad you don't have a
story of discrimination handy.

26:35.895 --> 26:38.196
It means you haven't experienced

26:38.297 --> 26:39.798
what some of these other girls have.

26:43.669 --> 26:47.105
But it means I'm not
right for this scholarship.

26:47.206 --> 26:50.108
(Sighs)

26:59.585 --> 27:02.287
(Quiet murmurs)

Ah, in private.

27:06.792 --> 27:09.644
_

27:09.728 --> 27:11.162
It's important.

27:15.401 --> 27:17.302
I want to thank everybody

27:17.403 --> 27:20.070

27:20.172 --> 27:22.339
Most of you know that this
is my second time around.

27:24.242 --> 27:27.744
I hope I learned a few
things from my first time

27:27.846 --> 27:29.646
<i>to become a better husband now.</i>

27:31.616 --> 27:35.786

living through my mistakes.

28:25.263 --> 28:28.213
This is spooky, but tell me more.

28:28.266 --> 28:30.467
Okay, the first house you and John lived in

28:30.568 --> 28:32.169
when he was at triple-A Omaha

28:32.270 --> 28:35.239
was 647 Fields Avenue.

28:35.339 --> 28:37.007
- Damn.
- Hm-mm.

28:37.108 --> 28:38.708
I know, I'm full of useless information

28:38.810 --> 28:40.210
about every player I've ever written about.

28:40.311 --> 28:42.780
So is all this stuff gonna be in the movie?

28:42.881 --> 28:44.681
Oh, no. It's fiction.

28:44.782 --> 28:48.284
Oh, in the movie, you are a
social worker named Miranda.

28:48.385 --> 28:50.653
A social worker?! No! No, no, no, no.

28:50.754 --> 28:52.121
I want to be something more glamorous.

28:52.222 --> 28:55.124
Like, um, a pastry chef

28:55.225 --> 28:56.659
or a jewelry designer.

28:56.760 --> 28:58.895
Oh, look at her giving notes already.

29:01.531 --> 29:03.299
So can I ask you one more question?

29:04.634 --> 29:05.867
Shoot.

29:07.804 --> 29:10.405
Did you ever sleep with my husband?

29:14.343 --> 29:15.743
No.

29:18.815 --> 29:21.116
Look, there might have been one night

29:21.217 --> 29:22.851
when I was in Cleveland

29:22.952 --> 29:25.821
and my fiancé and I just broke up.

29:25.922 --> 29:28.623
I let him know what room number I was in

29:28.724 --> 29:30.157
in case he was interested in stopping by.

29:30.258 --> 29:31.859
I...

29:31.960 --> 29:34.562
Later that night there
was a knock on the door.

29:35.664 --> 29:36.964
It was room service...

29:38.667 --> 29:40.835
with a slice of chocolate cake

29:40.936 --> 29:43.103
and a note that said

29:43.205 --> 29:45.172
"it's early in the game.

29:45.273 --> 29:46.574
It'll get better."

29:48.510 --> 29:51.178
John. (Rueful laugh)

29:51.339 --> 29:53.740
He's a good man.

29:53.841 --> 29:57.278
Yes. He is.

30:17.601 --> 30:20.006

30:20.935 --> 30:23.837
As long as I don't ask
you about your family?

30:28.428 --> 30:30.212
_

30:30.277 --> 30:33.046
That's okay, but...

30:33.147 --> 30:35.481
you don't want to talk about mine either.

30:37.016 --> 30:38.818
Every time I bring up my brother,

30:38.919 --> 30:40.920
you change the subject.

30:42.591 --> 30:44.980
_

30:44.991 --> 30:48.226
I'd rather talk about
him and feel a little sad

30:48.328 --> 30:50.763
than not talk about him at all.

32:54.950 --> 32:58.752
that I had been switched with Daphne...

33:00.822 --> 33:02.556
I looked around my room.

33:02.657 --> 33:05.759
And I tried to decide
what I should take with me.

33:08.296 --> 33:11.599
Wherever my real mom was. (Sighs)

33:11.700 --> 33:14.534
My thought my parents would only want

33:14.635 --> 33:17.404
their "real" daughter.

33:17.505 --> 33:20.173
But they just added Daphne.

33:20.274 --> 33:23.943
And now I have two families.

Not well, actually.

What happened?

34:24.937 --> 34:26.804
(Inhales sharply)

34:26.906 --> 34:29.141
- I withdrew my application.
- What?

34:29.241 --> 34:30.574
Why?

34:30.677 --> 34:32.678
Because I wasn't gonna win

34:32.779 --> 34:35.045
and I shouldn't have
applied in the first place.

34:35.147 --> 34:38.583
Daphne, we went over this. You are latina.

34:38.684 --> 34:41.585
You and I are the only
ones who see it that way.

34:41.687 --> 34:43.188
We're right.

34:43.289 --> 34:46.023
Why does someone else get
to decide what you are?

34:46.123 --> 34:48.659
If I won, I wouldn't feel right

34:48.760 --> 34:50.395
about taking it from someone

34:50.496 --> 34:52.129
who the whole world saw as latina.

34:52.231 --> 34:53.630
So they deserve it more

34:53.732 --> 34:55.900
because they have dark hair and brown skin?

34:56.001 --> 34:58.069
No, because people hold it against them

34:58.170 --> 35:01.005
the same way the hold
being deaf against me.

35:01.106 --> 35:02.440
I know what it feels like.

35:02.541 --> 35:04.842
So you're not latina

35:04.943 --> 35:06.143
because you don't feel burdened enough.

35:06.244 --> 35:09.346
Me and your grandmother

35:09.447 --> 35:10.948

36:25.381 --> 36:30.314
_

36:30.799 --> 36:32.966
Oh, really?

36:33.067 --> 36:35.168
Because some surprises are good.

36:41.709 --> 36:46.012
<i>♪ I can feel you shak-shaking. ♪</i>

36:50.584 --> 36:52.685
- Ooh! (Laughs)
- Hi, honey.

36:52.786 --> 36:54.253
Hey.

36:54.354 --> 36:57.256
I was wondering if I would
have to call the cops.

36:57.357 --> 36:58.424
Guess what?

36:58.525 --> 36:59.425
I love my book again.

36:59.526 --> 37:01.727
That Sarah Lazar is one smart cookie.

37:01.829 --> 37:03.295
(Chuckles)

37:03.396 --> 37:06.365
Is that you or the wine talking?

37:06.467 --> 37:09.101
Um, actually, I came to that conclusion

37:09.202 --> 37:11.671
before we finished the
first bottle of wine.

37:11.772 --> 37:13.705
How many bottles were there?

37:13.806 --> 37:15.507
Oh, don't worry. I took a cab.

37:15.608 --> 37:16.908
- Uh-huh.
- (Giggles)

37:17.009 --> 37:18.176
So you and Sarah

37:18.277 --> 37:20.979
have spent the last 3 1/2 hours talking

37:21.080 --> 37:22.213
and drinking wine?

37:22.314 --> 37:23.548
Yeah.

37:23.649 --> 37:25.517
(Giggles)

37:25.618 --> 37:27.586
(Sighs) You're a good man.

37:27.687 --> 37:29.521
Hmm.

37:29.622 --> 37:31.422
You know what you're gonna do now?

37:31.524 --> 37:33.024
- You're gonna go upstairs...
- Mmm!

37:33.125 --> 37:35.527
... and I am gonna bring you some aspirin

37:35.628 --> 37:37.761
and a barrel of water.

37:37.863 --> 37:39.563
- Good idea.
- Go.

37:44.003 --> 37:45.403
I love you.

37:45.504 --> 37:46.937
I love you.

37:49.574 --> 37:51.775
Oh, brother. (Chuckles)

37:55.514 --> 37:57.048
(Sighs)

37:57.149 --> 37:59.349
It's cold out here.

38:02.587 --> 38:07.858
So I think that I should
do premed at Gallaudet.

38:07.959 --> 38:09.493
It's a whole lot more reasonable

38:09.594 --> 38:10.728
and that's fine.

38:10.829 --> 38:12.229
It's not like you to give up.

38:12.330 --> 38:14.197
I don't want to fight

38:14.298 --> 38:17.601
and I don't want you to worry about money.

38:17.702 --> 38:19.236
(Chuckles)

38:19.337 --> 38:21.939
I will always worry about money.

38:24.743 --> 38:27.144
I'm sorry I blew up at you.

38:27.245 --> 38:29.780
When I said that I was
a Kennish by blood...

38:29.881 --> 38:31.548
I know, sweetie.

38:31.649 --> 38:33.550
(Sighs)

38:34.718 --> 38:37.054
When you're a mom, you'll understand.

38:38.622 --> 38:40.023
You love your kids so much

38:40.124 --> 38:42.259
that you want to keep them close to you.

38:42.360 --> 38:44.694
And you don't want to share them.

38:44.795 --> 38:47.130
(Inhales deeply)

38:47.231 --> 38:51.068
But things happened the way they did

38:51.169 --> 38:54.104
and you're a Kennish, too.

38:54.205 --> 38:55.939
I do have to share you.

38:58.008 --> 39:00.710
John and Kathryn want
to pay for your college.

39:02.780 --> 39:04.614
- I don't think...
- I said no.

39:07.185 --> 39:09.352
Because I was afraid.

39:09.454 --> 39:11.520
Of what?

39:13.457 --> 39:16.158
That you would be less mine

39:16.259 --> 39:18.861
if they could give you
something I couldn't.

39:20.564 --> 39:22.131
But that's not fair to you.

39:22.232 --> 39:24.500
(Inhales deeply)

39:24.602 --> 39:26.636
John and Kathryn want
to pay for your college

39:26.737 --> 39:28.771
and they can.

39:28.872 --> 39:30.206
And that's a good thing.

39:30.307 --> 39:32.108
Are you sure?

39:32.209 --> 39:33.175
Mm-hmm.

39:33.276 --> 39:35.411
Well, I'm still gonna apply

39:35.512 --> 39:37.080
for deafie scholarships too.

39:37.180 --> 39:39.181
Good.

39:39.282 --> 39:41.484
John and Kathryn shouldn't
pay for everything.

39:41.585 --> 39:42.685
It'll make you soft.

39:43.687 --> 39:45.121
(Laughs)

39:48.993 --> 39:50.058
Hi.

39:50.059 --> 39:50.887

39:52.358 --> 39:53.531

39:53.863 --> 39:56.464
Uh, better. He's in his room

39:56.565 --> 39:57.899
texting with Cameron.

39:57.900 --> 39:59.991
_

40:00.003 --> 40:01.136
Oh, sure.

40:01.237 --> 40:02.604
Uh...

40:04.440 --> 40:07.509
I know about your job offer in Madison.

40:10.713 --> 40:13.015
I wish you would stay.

40:13.116 --> 40:18.285
For Emmet. And not just
because we're dating again.

40:18.486 --> 40:21.202
_

40:21.556 --> 40:23.090

40:23.761 --> 40:26.701

40:33.969 --> 40:35.269

40:36.938 --> 40:38.472
Oh.

40:38.573 --> 40:40.941
That Gabe guy?

40:41.043 --> 40:42.309
Really cute.

40:44.210 --> 40:45.148

40:45.346 --> 40:46.713
