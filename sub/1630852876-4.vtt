WEBVTT

00:08.413 --> 00:10.493
[Narrator] Reaching the other
side of the world is a dream

00:10.517 --> 00:12.068
many of a share.

00:12.103 --> 00:16.310
But by flying over, are we
forgetting how to travel through?

00:19.827 --> 00:24.344
Mexico City, North
America's largest Metropolis

00:25.344 --> 00:28.000
to ushuaia, Argentina,

00:28.034 --> 00:30.724
the most southerly
city in the world.

00:30.758 --> 00:33.379
Twenty hours by plane.

00:33.413 --> 00:38.034
But could you travel the length
of Latin America at ground level

00:38.068 --> 00:40.551
and all for the
price of the airfare.

00:40.586 --> 00:42.793
[Man] What have
we got ourselves into.

00:42.827 --> 00:46.172
[Narrator] Five pairs of ordinary
brits are attempting just that.

00:46.206 --> 00:47.862
Let's go!

00:47.896 --> 00:51.034
[Narrator] They will cover
over 25,000 kilometers...

00:52.448 --> 00:55.068
Moments like this, you will
remember for the rest of your life.

00:55.103 --> 00:58.758
In a demanding
and challenging race,

00:58.793 --> 01:00.724
which soars high into the andes,

01:01.344 --> 01:03.482
crosses vast deserts

01:03.517 --> 01:07.000
and navigate some of the
world's most volatile regions.

01:07.965 --> 01:10.206
He's coming here with a gun.

01:10.241 --> 01:12.275
[Narrator] Have they
got what it takes?

01:12.310 --> 01:15.241
Got no Google maps,
got no mum, got nothing.

01:15.275 --> 01:17.424
- [Indistinct shouting]
- [Narrator] Both physically...

01:17.448 --> 01:18.768
[Woman] Someone
call an ambulance.

01:19.379 --> 01:20.896
And emotionally.

01:20.931 --> 01:23.724
We need a miracle
to get out of here.

01:23.758 --> 01:25.275
[Narrator] The
rewards are great.

01:25.310 --> 01:27.103
This is crazy good.

01:27.137 --> 01:28.817
[Emon] This has brought
us closer together.

01:30.137 --> 01:32.000
[Narrator] The first
team to the finish line

01:32.034 --> 01:34.965
will claim the prize of Â£20,000,

01:36.379 --> 01:38.379
- in a race...
- [Man] Let's go, let's go, let's go.

01:38.413 --> 01:39.689
Across the world.

01:39.724 --> 01:41.000
[Speaking Spanish]

01:41.034 --> 01:43.344
Excitement, adventure, trauma.

01:44.896 --> 01:45.896
Oh, my god.

01:50.586 --> 01:51.482
[Narrator reading]

01:51.517 --> 01:53.689
[Lizzie] Your third
checkpoint is Quito.

01:53.724 --> 01:57.413
[Narrator] The teams took to
the open sea en route to Ecuador.

01:57.448 --> 01:59.482
Best mode of transport ever!

01:59.517 --> 02:00.838
- [Cell phone ringing]
- Oh, good god.

02:00.862 --> 02:04.275
A state of emergency has
been declared in Ecuador,

02:04.310 --> 02:09.137
[narrator] But dramatic events meant
a detour to the Colombian desert.

02:09.172 --> 02:12.241
[Dom] The checkpoint
is now tatacoa desert.

02:12.275 --> 02:14.586
I want to go now.

02:14.620 --> 02:16.344
[Narrator] Things
got too much for Sam.

02:16.379 --> 02:18.931
[Jo] It's like the...
The end of it for us.

02:18.965 --> 02:22.275
Night three, not sleeping
in a bed. It's not ideal.

02:22.310 --> 02:25.724
[Narrator] Jen and Rob
prioritize budget over comfort.

02:25.758 --> 02:27.217
[Jen] I mean, I'm
obviously exhausted.

02:27.241 --> 02:29.931
I've not showered in three days,
got the same pants on for four days.

02:29.965 --> 02:31.758
[Narrator] Emon sacrificed...

02:31.793 --> 02:33.389
You want to choose the
race over the experience?

02:33.413 --> 02:36.862
So uncle and nephew rise
to the top for the first time.

02:36.896 --> 02:38.103
[Both laughing]

02:38.137 --> 02:40.586
[Narrator] Three teams
made the checkpoint...

02:40.620 --> 02:42.620
Where's Liz and dom, then?

02:42.655 --> 02:45.344
But one is yet to appear.

02:45.379 --> 02:48.103
Maybe we have been a
bit too late back this leg.

02:52.137 --> 02:56.034
-[Dom] I think it's this way -[Lizzie]
I actually can't see a bloody thing.

02:56.068 --> 02:59.896
[Narrator] Dom and Lizzie arrive
12 hours after the race leader's

02:59.931 --> 03:01.586
it's starting to rain,
dom. I can feel it.

03:01.620 --> 03:04.068
- [Dom groans] Why?
- It's in the bloody desert.

03:04.103 --> 03:05.148
- [Dom] Right.
- Oh, here we are.

03:05.172 --> 03:09.137
[Speaking Spanish]

03:09.172 --> 03:10.241
[Dom and Lizzie] Right.

03:11.068 --> 03:12.172
[Both groan]

03:12.206 --> 03:15.931
[Dom] Oh, god.
We've come last. Pfft!

03:15.965 --> 03:18.551
We've only got 12 hours between
us and jamiul and emon, so...

03:19.241 --> 03:20.758
[Speaking Spanish]

03:20.793 --> 03:23.172
- we're ready to go.
- Bring on leg four.

03:28.551 --> 03:30.068
[Jen] Oh, it's very wobbly.

03:30.103 --> 03:34.034
Oh, my god. I don't know
if this is terrifying or fun.

03:34.068 --> 03:35.448
[Rob laughing]

03:35.482 --> 03:38.068
[Narrator] While some of the
teams explore the tatacoa desert,

03:38.103 --> 03:40.793
- [Lizzie] Ooh.
- [Dom] It's like something off star wars.

03:40.827 --> 03:42.896
I had no idea what it
was going to look like.

03:42.931 --> 03:44.596
We arrived in the dark,
and this morning I woke

03:44.620 --> 03:46.344
and I was like, "whoa."

03:46.379 --> 03:48.838
-[Emon] It'll be sad to leave this
place., -[Jamiul] Yeah, it's nice.

03:48.862 --> 03:50.758
[Emon] Feels though
it has more to give.

03:50.793 --> 03:54.344
[Narrator] First to
depart... Emon and jamiul.

03:56.379 --> 03:58.275
[Woman speaking Spanish]

03:58.310 --> 04:00.355
[Emon] I think, is the plan
to head straight out of here

04:00.379 --> 04:01.448
as fast as we can.

04:01.482 --> 04:03.079
All the teams are very
close together now.

04:03.103 --> 04:04.862
We were last, last
leg and now we're first,

04:04.896 --> 04:07.758
and it is a fine line
between fourth and first.

04:08.689 --> 04:10.689
Your fourth checkpoint is puno.

04:10.724 --> 04:11.931
Puno.

04:11.965 --> 04:14.344
I don't know where that
is. Where the hell is puno?

04:15.413 --> 04:17.000
[Narrator] In the south of Peru,

04:17.034 --> 04:20.206
at 3,800 meters above sea-level,

04:20.758 --> 04:22.517
the city of puno.

04:25.310 --> 04:28.275
Perched on the shores of
the largest and highest leak

04:28.310 --> 04:32.482
in South America, lake titicaca.

04:32.517 --> 04:35.206
To reach it, the teams will
need to navigate their way

04:35.241 --> 04:37.931
through the country's
towering mountains,

04:37.965 --> 04:41.000
coastal deserts
and ancient cities

04:41.034 --> 04:43.482
of the once mighty inca empire.

04:45.103 --> 04:46.907
- [Jamiul] Hello, hello.
- What are you doing here?

04:46.931 --> 04:49.517
- Why are you back?
- [Jamiul] Big news.

04:49.551 --> 04:53.620
[Narrator] But first, an
urgent change to the schedule.

04:53.655 --> 04:55.320
- [Jamiul] We've got the envelope here.
- [All gasp]

04:55.344 --> 04:57.010
- Well, there's something on the back...
- [Jen] No.

04:57.034 --> 04:59.172
And I'll read it
out to you. Right.

04:59.206 --> 05:03.413
Due to extraordinary circumstances of
the ongoing state of emergency in Ecuador

05:03.448 --> 05:05.482
and the impassable
nature of the Amazon jungle,

05:05.517 --> 05:08.620
it is not possible for you to continue
your journey south by land or sea.

05:08.655 --> 05:10.241
- [Jen] No.
- [Jo] What?

05:10.275 --> 05:13.000
[Jen] Yeah. How does that work?

05:13.034 --> 05:15.655
[Narrator] With violent protests
against government cutbacks

05:15.689 --> 05:18.137
escalating on the
streets of Ecuador,

05:18.172 --> 05:23.310
a state of emergency is in place
with borders to the country closed.

05:25.137 --> 05:28.413
The only other land route
from Colombia into Peru

05:28.448 --> 05:31.620
is through thick
amazonian jungle.

05:31.655 --> 05:34.000
But the presence of
armed guerrilla groups

05:34.034 --> 05:37.310
means traveling through
this area is prohibited.

05:37.344 --> 05:41.068
For your safety, it is now
necessary for you to fly to Peru

05:41.103 --> 05:43.068
in order to continue
towards the finish line.

05:43.103 --> 05:44.862
Oh my god, we're flying.

05:44.896 --> 05:46.275
It's actually quite a shame.

05:46.310 --> 05:49.344
We've done that whole journey
to miss out quite a big chunk.

05:49.379 --> 05:50.931
That's actually quite sad.

05:50.965 --> 05:52.448
It must be pretty serious

05:52.482 --> 05:54.896
if we have to resort
to these measures.

05:54.931 --> 05:57.103
[Rob] We got so far
without having to use a flight.

05:57.137 --> 05:58.758
Yeah, yeah.

05:58.793 --> 06:00.113
[Emon] Quite a good
amount to be fair.

06:00.137 --> 06:02.965
[Jamiul] So you want
to do it by land or sea?

06:03.000 --> 06:06.182
Nothing can be done, really. When we have
to take a flight, we have to take a flight.

06:06.206 --> 06:08.689
It's a real shame we're
going to miss Ecuador.

06:08.724 --> 06:10.448
At the end of the day,
safety is Paramount.

06:10.482 --> 06:13.000
- Yeah. Yeah.
- So, you know, we have to take it on the chin.

06:21.172 --> 06:23.620
[Narrator] The new starting
point for the fourth leg

06:23.655 --> 06:26.344
is at the nearest
possible airport in Peru.

06:33.655 --> 06:35.838
Well, everyone feels like
being on the plane is cheating

06:35.862 --> 06:38.862
and I... I absolutely
bloody love it.

06:40.310 --> 06:42.448
I could get used to
this mode of transport.

06:48.034 --> 06:51.551
[Narrator] In the foothills
of the andes, jaen city,

06:51.586 --> 06:54.931
the jumping off point
for father travel south,

06:54.965 --> 06:56.724
towards the next checkpoint,

06:56.758 --> 07:01.034
at least a 2300 kilometer
journey away in puno.

07:03.827 --> 07:09.172
Twenty kilometers north of jaen is
the city's brand new airport terminal.

07:09.206 --> 07:12.034
- [Sam] A bamboo airport, cool.
- [Jo] Pretty cool, isn't it?

07:12.068 --> 07:13.241
[Sam] It's impressive, this.

07:17.758 --> 07:19.278
[Narrator] The teams
will be held here,

07:19.310 --> 07:21.517
starting the race in
the order they arrived

07:21.551 --> 07:24.310
into the tatacoa checkpoint.

07:24.344 --> 07:28.034
[Jamiul] Our lead is 2 hours and
28 minutes ahead of Jen and Rob.

07:28.068 --> 07:29.655
I think it's time. Let's go.

07:29.689 --> 07:30.793
Let's go. Let's do this.

07:30.827 --> 07:33.000
- See you later, guys.
- Good luck, guys.

07:33.034 --> 07:34.872
[Jamiul] The race is
definitely getting harder.

07:34.896 --> 07:36.379
I'm very worried
about the budget.

07:36.413 --> 07:38.034
I'm petrified about the budget.

07:38.068 --> 07:40.586
[Narrator] With over
half the race still to go,

07:40.620 --> 07:44.379
emon and jamiul have spent
more than half their entire budget.

07:44.413 --> 07:47.206
It has played in my mind that
we might not make the end.

07:47.241 --> 07:50.034
I honestly can't see us making
it with the budget that we got,

07:50.068 --> 07:51.103
and that worries me.

07:51.137 --> 07:52.620
It worries me a lot.

07:52.655 --> 07:55.448
[Emon] It's all about
planning our routes a bit better.

07:55.482 --> 07:57.862
To go through Peru, you
can go through the andes,

07:57.896 --> 07:59.827
which is going to be,
uh, very mountainous.

07:59.862 --> 08:02.103
Although it is a shorter
route by looking at the map.

08:02.137 --> 08:04.310
I just feel it's going
to be a lot longer.

08:05.896 --> 08:09.379
[Narrator] Peru is divided
north to south by the andes,

08:09.413 --> 08:13.551
with the faster travel connections
found along the low lying coastal roads.

08:14.655 --> 08:17.172
The other option is
to go down the coast.

08:17.206 --> 08:20.241
I'm assuming the road
networks is going to be a lot flatter

08:20.275 --> 08:21.827
- and a lot quicker.
- Mm-hmm.

08:21.862 --> 08:25.655
[Narrator] But to reach puno,
3,100 meters above sea level,

08:25.689 --> 08:29.517
the teams must at some
point climb into the mountains.

08:29.551 --> 08:33.172
Whilst most travelers choose
a slow but steady ascent,

08:33.206 --> 08:37.965
others may be tempted by a steeper
but quicker climb to the checkpoint,

08:38.000 --> 08:42.413
running the risk of problems
with altitude sickness.

08:42.448 --> 08:45.206
[Emon] If you can make it through
trujillo today, there's a job there

08:45.241 --> 08:47.551
that I think is
perfect for us to do.

08:47.586 --> 08:48.965
[Speaking Spanish]

08:49.000 --> 08:51.010
-[Narrator] With money a priority...
-[Speaking Spanish]

08:51.034 --> 08:54.034
emon and jamiul are traveling
via a small fishing town

08:54.068 --> 08:57.517
near the city of trujillo,
where they can pick up work.

08:59.103 --> 09:01.517
[Emon] Right, let's
go buy those tickets.

09:01.551 --> 09:04.689
I want to get the 10:30 bus,
which is in about five minutes.

09:04.724 --> 09:07.275
We're hoping that we get
into trujillo at about 8:00.

09:07.310 --> 09:09.310
We don't want to be
stuck with the others,

09:09.344 --> 09:11.264
so we're just trying to
move as fast as possible.

09:16.655 --> 09:20.137
- Do you think we can make up the 12 hours?
- Yeah. Easy.

09:20.172 --> 09:24.655
- [Dom] Just go steal Jo's passport.
- [Both chuckling]

09:24.689 --> 09:25.931
[Narrator] Back at the airport,

09:25.965 --> 09:29.931
the rest of the teams
wait to resume their race.

09:29.965 --> 09:34.586
- [Jen] Titicaca. Titi... caca.
- [Rob] Titicana. Titicaca.

09:34.620 --> 09:36.413
Titicaca.

09:36.448 --> 09:38.103
[Narrator] Second
team due to depart,

09:38.137 --> 09:40.275
two-and-a-half hours
behind the leaders,

09:40.310 --> 09:42.172
Jane and Rob.

09:42.206 --> 09:44.827
We've seen this opportunity
to work with bears.

09:44.862 --> 09:47.965
I think it's like a rehabilitation
center from what I gather.

09:48.000 --> 09:51.620
I'm into pets, so I would
like to work with the bears.

09:51.655 --> 09:55.344
[Narrator] They've spotted a job giving them
a chance to work at an animal sanctuary.

09:55.379 --> 09:56.734
I've never seen
a bear in real life.

09:56.758 --> 09:59.793
- [Rob] That would be cool.
- [Jen] We might even see Paddington.

09:59.827 --> 10:04.172
- So, that would see us start on the pacific route.
- [Rob] Yeah.

10:06.068 --> 10:07.586
[Rob] Let's go.

10:07.620 --> 10:10.655
Now I'm ready to strike this
balance between race and experience,

10:10.689 --> 10:13.344
every leg I've been getting,
like, braver and braver and braver.

10:13.379 --> 10:15.344
And actually, now,
speaking about it...

10:15.379 --> 10:17.010
- You're excited.
- I'm actually a bit excited

10:17.034 --> 10:19.068
to see Peru. I don't
really know much about it.

10:19.103 --> 10:20.620
I just know,
obviously, that there is,

10:20.655 --> 10:22.793
um... [gasps] Guinea pigs.

10:22.827 --> 10:24.413
- That they eat.
- I know they eat them.

10:24.448 --> 10:26.620
I just have to not
think about that.

10:26.655 --> 10:30.620
[Narrator] Jen and Rob are
planning to travel south via chiclayo,

10:30.655 --> 10:33.034
the closest city to
the bear sanctuary

10:34.034 --> 10:35.000
if we get a night bus,

10:35.034 --> 10:36.793
we do have to find
an accommodation.

10:36.827 --> 10:38.182
Don't especially want
to get a night bus,

10:38.206 --> 10:41.275
but it's just a ridiculous
amount of money that we save.

10:41.310 --> 10:44.724
We all stranded here
in jaen until 10:00 P.M.

10:44.758 --> 10:47.137
- [Marching band music
playing in distance] - [Jen groans]

10:47.172 --> 10:52.068
- [Jen] I can hear a parade.
- [Rob] Hmm. It's a funeral, I think.

10:52.103 --> 10:55.068
[Jen] There's a load of
people. Hundreds of people.

10:56.965 --> 10:58.551
Well, that came out of the blue.

11:03.379 --> 11:04.931
[Speaking Spanish]

11:04.965 --> 11:07.862
[Narrator] Joining the race
nine-and-a-half hours behind the leaders,

11:07.896 --> 11:09.137
Jo and Sam.

11:11.517 --> 11:14.655
[Jo speaking Spanish]

11:14.689 --> 11:18.034
So we're getting a night bus. The
earlier ones are all fully booked.

11:18.068 --> 11:19.758
So, we're getting an 11:00 one.

11:19.793 --> 11:21.448
[Sam] Do you know
what time it arrives?

11:21.482 --> 11:22.689
6:00 in the morning.

11:22.724 --> 11:25.689
- [Sam] I love the bus journey.
- [Jo] Fabulous.

11:25.724 --> 11:28.379
[Sam] Let's go get
some food. I'm starving.

11:28.413 --> 11:33.172
I don't know whether I can keep up
with budgeting on food, especially.

11:33.206 --> 11:35.620
Like, I... I like to eat

11:35.655 --> 11:40.172
and I don't like not being able to
spend as much as I would want to

11:40.206 --> 11:41.413
on what I'd want to.

11:41.448 --> 11:43.862
I just don't like that.

11:43.896 --> 11:48.896
- How long till the bus?
- An hour... and a bit.

11:48.931 --> 11:50.896
So we need to probably
leave in half an hour.

11:50.931 --> 11:53.379
No. I'm going to go and
get more food after this

11:53.413 --> 11:56.000
[Jo] Sam's still
seems to be struggling.

11:56.034 --> 11:59.758
We've decided to do more
things that he wants to do.

11:59.793 --> 12:04.758
Unfortunately, that will make a dent
in our budget, but I think it's worth it.

12:06.000 --> 12:07.827
[Sam groans] I'm still hungry.

12:14.275 --> 12:16.172
[Speaking Spanish]

12:16.206 --> 12:18.655
Oh, we're going.
They're locking up. Okay.

12:18.689 --> 12:20.838
- They're shutting the airport?
- Right. Let's get our stuff.

12:20.862 --> 12:22.931
[Speaking Spanish]

12:22.965 --> 12:27.724
[Narrator] At the airport, just
one team are still waiting to depart.

12:27.758 --> 12:31.758
[Dom] We're last.
We can't even move.

12:31.793 --> 12:34.586
Can't do anything
about it for two hours.

12:36.172 --> 12:38.137
[Seagulls squawking]

12:40.137 --> 12:43.344
After... we go...
We go to fishing.

12:43.379 --> 12:46.379
-[Emon] Yeah, -and then, after,
if possible, if you have lucky guys,

12:46.413 --> 12:47.862
- you have a fish.
- Oh, okay.

12:47.896 --> 12:50.241
Then we come back to the
houses and we can prepare the fish.

12:50.275 --> 12:52.148
[Jamiul] Oh, awesome.
Yeah, that would be amazing.

12:52.172 --> 12:54.206
This is... if you help
me, I can help you.

12:54.241 --> 12:57.068
- Okay. Brilliant, yeah.
- [Emon] Fingers crossed, we catch something.

12:57.103 --> 13:00.206
[Narrator] Emon and jamiul
have woken up in huanchaco...

13:00.241 --> 13:01.517
[Emon] Awesome.

13:01.551 --> 13:04.413
On the country's
northwest coast.

13:04.448 --> 13:06.827
Driving on the streets of Peru.

13:06.862 --> 13:10.034
[Narrator] Today, they'll be working
in exchange for accommodation

13:10.068 --> 13:13.241
with a meal thrown
in if they can catch it.

13:14.965 --> 13:18.275
Local fishermen like
John surf the pacific waters

13:18.310 --> 13:20.620
on small boats made from Reed,

13:20.655 --> 13:24.137
a tradition that goes
back over 3,000 years.

13:24.172 --> 13:28.724
This is a tora horse. Because
the nose, the wave is coming...

13:28.758 --> 13:31.517
- So the nose is this...
- [Emon] Ah, and then it goes down.

13:31.551 --> 13:33.137
Like a... like a horse.

13:33.172 --> 13:34.034
[Emon] Okay, yeah.

13:34.068 --> 13:36.517
- [John] This is 50 kilos.
- [Emon] Wow.

13:36.551 --> 13:39.931
And with water,
after, it's 120 kilos.

13:39.965 --> 13:41.862
- Heavy, ain't it?
- It's heavy.

13:41.896 --> 13:44.275
- [Emon and jamiul] Wow!
- [John] Yeah.

13:44.310 --> 13:48.758
[John] This is, uh, my family.
You know, my father, my uncle.

13:48.793 --> 13:50.389
To be honest, I just
thought we'd just come here

13:50.413 --> 13:52.068
to do a bit of
fishing with a stick.

13:52.103 --> 13:54.413
Didn't realize there was
all this involved, like, nets,

13:54.448 --> 13:56.344
also these incredible boats.

14:06.862 --> 14:08.310
[Jamiul] I'm all excited.

14:08.344 --> 14:11.758
This is so different to what I
had imagined that we'd be doing.

14:12.620 --> 14:15.000
- [Indiscernible]
- [Laughter]

14:16.206 --> 14:17.206
[Emon groans]

14:20.206 --> 14:22.379
[Narrator] John and
his father, Santos,

14:22.413 --> 14:25.482
have been fishing
together for 24 years,

14:25.517 --> 14:27.862
and still use
traditional techniques

14:27.896 --> 14:31.413
that have been passed down
through their family for generations.

14:31.448 --> 14:33.068
John mentioned his
grandfather did this.

14:33.103 --> 14:34.689
And his grandfather
before did this.

14:34.724 --> 14:36.251
The cultural background
that I come from

14:36.275 --> 14:38.517
of someone from a
British-bengali family,

14:38.551 --> 14:41.413
I can't see the resemblance
in the family unity here.

14:41.448 --> 14:43.862
- I've got some fish.
- How many have you got?

14:44.482 --> 14:45.862
- Five.
- Five?

14:50.413 --> 14:52.758
[Whooping]

14:53.689 --> 14:54.931
[Emon] That was amazing.

14:54.965 --> 14:56.596
Quite surprised, the
amount of fish that we caught.

14:56.620 --> 14:58.137
And they're, like,
big, juicy fishes,

14:58.172 --> 15:00.933
you know, they're not, like, small
mackerel that you find back at home.

15:03.103 --> 15:04.931
I'm looking forward
to eating the catch.

15:04.965 --> 15:06.206
I can't wait.

15:06.241 --> 15:08.551
This is going to be our
first taste of Peruvian food.

15:14.206 --> 15:16.724
Oh, it's cold! That is cold.

15:16.758 --> 15:18.931
Oh, my nipples are hard already.

15:18.965 --> 15:23.103
[Shuddering and shivering]

15:23.137 --> 15:28.068
That was the worst shower.
I have ever had... in my life.

15:28.103 --> 15:31.689
[Narrator] In chiclayo, having
traveled overnight from jaen,

15:31.724 --> 15:34.068
Joe and Sam are planning
their onward journey

15:34.103 --> 15:36.827
to Peru's capital, Lima,

15:36.862 --> 15:38.734
[Jo] So we've got four
hours to wait for the bus,

15:38.758 --> 15:43.931
but we decided to upgrade because we
were quite uncomfortable on the way here.

15:43.965 --> 15:47.344
It was about 40
quid, so 20 quid each.

15:47.379 --> 15:49.931
Travel in style and
comfort. [Sighs]

15:49.965 --> 15:52.068
That's what we're
going to do from now on.

15:52.103 --> 15:54.724
[Narrator] With Jo's
strategy to relax the budget...

15:54.758 --> 15:56.113
[Jo] Oh, look,
there's the barber's.

15:56.137 --> 15:57.758
- [Woman] Ola.
- [Sam] Hello.

15:57.793 --> 16:00.965
It's not just their travel
that's getting an upgrade.

16:01.000 --> 16:04.620
Budget's tight, but we
splashed the ice on the haircut.

16:04.655 --> 16:07.896
Oh, god. I feel like I
haven't got a haircut in ages.

16:07.931 --> 16:09.620
[Jo] What about that one?

16:09.655 --> 16:11.689
It's not a short on the side.

16:11.724 --> 16:12.724
This one?

16:12.758 --> 16:14.310
I know what looks best.

16:14.344 --> 16:17.344
I know what makes him
look even better looking.

16:17.379 --> 16:20.241
He's 19, but he's still my baby,

16:20.275 --> 16:22.172
[retches] So...

16:22.206 --> 16:24.068
You're like a little turtle.

16:24.103 --> 16:27.068
I don't want you to be
set free like they are.

16:27.103 --> 16:28.655
[Both laughing]

16:28.689 --> 16:32.379
[Jo] I think Sam can now see the
positives he has got out of the race.

16:32.413 --> 16:34.000
He has tried new things,

16:34.034 --> 16:36.068
he's come out of
his comfort zone,

16:36.103 --> 16:40.448
he's been able to combat
some of his fears and panics.

16:40.482 --> 16:43.413
But it's continuing
to try and find things

16:43.448 --> 16:47.206
that will hopefully give him
encouragement and confidence

16:47.241 --> 16:50.758
so that hopefully we
can stay in the race.

16:50.793 --> 16:55.241
Since the salsa bite, it's,
uh, changed my ways a bit.

16:56.310 --> 16:57.931
New haircut, new me.

16:59.689 --> 17:00.758
[Sam chuckles]

17:01.586 --> 17:03.034
That feel better?

17:03.068 --> 17:04.413
Yeah, I know.

17:04.448 --> 17:07.137
-Feels like a tree.
-But it looks great. You look good.

17:12.344 --> 17:13.862
[Lizzie] We're
heading towards Lima.

17:13.896 --> 17:16.034
It's the capital,
well connected,

17:16.068 --> 17:17.320
so I'm really happy to go there.

17:17.344 --> 17:18.344
Okay.

17:19.068 --> 17:20.517
[Narrator] Finally on the road.

17:20.551 --> 17:23.103
Dom and Lizzie are
en route to chiclayo,

17:23.137 --> 17:26.068
where they plan to find
the next available bus south

17:26.103 --> 17:28.517
towards the
transport hub of Lima.

17:29.206 --> 17:30.275
I'm really happy with

17:30.310 --> 17:32.724
the fact that I can explore
my link to Saint Rose

17:32.758 --> 17:34.586
and it is an amazing city.

17:36.241 --> 17:37.931
Dom and I had quite
a catholic upbringing.

17:37.965 --> 17:39.724
It was very important
to our childhood

17:39.758 --> 17:41.448
and to my mum and to my grandma.

17:41.482 --> 17:44.286
When I was conferred, my catholic
Saint name that my grandma chose for me

17:44.310 --> 17:48.275
was st Rose of Lima, so I'm
quite excited to explore Lima

17:48.310 --> 17:51.206
and see if we could find out
more about Saint Rose's life

17:51.241 --> 17:53.620
and what she did and
why she became a Saint.

17:53.655 --> 17:57.275
It makes the Lima
more personal for us.

17:57.310 --> 18:00.827
[Narrator] To reach Lima and
close the gap on the other team's,

18:00.862 --> 18:04.000
dom and Lizzie need
a swift bus transfer.

18:04.034 --> 18:07.586
[Lizzie] Dostickets for
Lima. We only have dollars.

18:07.620 --> 18:08.965
[Dom] We only have dollars.

18:09.000 --> 18:11.724
How much is soles for dosperson?

18:11.758 --> 18:13.241
[Woman speaking Spanish]

18:13.275 --> 18:15.448
$60 between us. So
we've got to ask someone...

18:15.482 --> 18:17.000
- $60?
- Yeah,

18:17.034 --> 18:19.379
[narrator] The next bus
leaves in five minutes,

18:19.413 --> 18:22.655
but payment can only
be made in local currency.

18:22.689 --> 18:24.424
[Dom] Do you want me
to see if I can exchange it?

18:24.448 --> 18:27.551
I'll give you 70. Just
run. Just run and do it.

18:31.413 --> 18:34.000
[Speaking Spanish]
Dollars into soles?

18:34.655 --> 18:36.931
[Men speaking Spanish]

18:37.896 --> 18:40.275
If we make this... bus,

18:40.310 --> 18:41.379
it's an absolute miracle.

18:45.241 --> 18:46.344
Ah, it's shut.

18:46.379 --> 18:48.172
[Cars honking]

18:49.172 --> 18:52.034
Right, we've got four minutes...

18:52.068 --> 18:55.344
Uh, dollars... into soles?

18:55.379 --> 18:57.034
[Speaking Spanish]

18:57.827 --> 19:01.068
[Speaking Spanish] That's okay.

19:05.034 --> 19:07.551
- [Dom panting]
- Thank god.

19:07.586 --> 19:10.344
-You owe me one, Lizzie.
-[Chuckling] Thank you so much, dom.

19:11.379 --> 19:13.172
How'd you do that?

19:13.206 --> 19:15.448
- I ran.
- Ugh, probably cried.

19:15.482 --> 19:17.862
I don't know why I just
didn't take my bag off here.

19:17.896 --> 19:20.034
- [Lizzie laughs] - But
nothing's ever easy, is it?

19:21.413 --> 19:24.000
[Narrator] Dom and Lizzie
making their connection to Lima

19:24.034 --> 19:27.482
means they're leaving
chiclayo ahead of Jo and Sam,

19:27.517 --> 19:31.655
who have opted for
vip travel on a later bus.

19:31.689 --> 19:36.448
Emon and jamiul are 200
kilometers south in huanchaco,

19:36.482 --> 19:40.172
while Jen and Rob are heading
60 kilometers east of chiclayo

19:40.206 --> 19:42.655
towards chaparri bear sanctuary.

19:45.034 --> 19:47.344
You want to talk bears?

19:47.379 --> 19:49.482
I'm gonna make 'em
such a yummy meal.

19:49.517 --> 19:50.965
Marmalade, sandwiches.

19:52.000 --> 19:54.517
Do you like to feed
milk to a baby one?

19:54.551 --> 19:57.620
Not from my own
breast, but from a bottle.

19:57.655 --> 19:59.724
There's not a maternal
bone in my bloody body.

19:59.758 --> 20:01.896
[Rob] Oh, that is a massive lie.

20:01.931 --> 20:03.965
You're always caring and
looking after everybody.

20:04.000 --> 20:06.275
Aw, that's nice. I
disagree, but thank you.

20:07.965 --> 20:11.551
-[Rob] Hey, we're here.
-[Jen] Show me the bears! [Giggling] I'm ready.

20:12.310 --> 20:16.517
I'm ready. Ready.

20:16.551 --> 20:19.827
[Narrator] Sitting in a 34,000
hectare nature reserve,

20:19.862 --> 20:21.344
chaparri is a rescue center

20:23.448 --> 20:25.758
[Jen] Oh, look at you!

20:25.793 --> 20:29.310
[Narrator] Named after the
distinctive markings around their eyes.

20:29.344 --> 20:31.517
[Jen] They look a
little bit likepaddington.

20:31.551 --> 20:34.344
Is this really hot here, 'cause
they've not got their coats on?

20:34.379 --> 20:37.379
[Narrator] They are the only species
of bear, native to South America.

20:38.241 --> 20:39.965
[Jen] Bear!

20:40.000 --> 20:43.896
[Jen] Hello! He waved. Oh, do
you think he learned that in a circus?

20:43.931 --> 20:46.068
- [Rob] Maybe.
- [Jen] Oh, that's sad.

20:46.103 --> 20:50.758
[Narrator] The sanctuary is home to seven
bears, many of them rescued from circuses,

20:50.793 --> 20:52.517
where they suffered
mistreatment.

20:54.241 --> 21:00.965
[Speaking Spanish]

21:02.482 --> 21:05.689
[Jen] Okay. So, we're cleaning
the pen, apparently for a new bear.

21:07.724 --> 21:11.931
[Narrator] Once the bears arrive here,
they're settled in one of the small enclosures

21:11.965 --> 21:15.724
for rehabilitation. Before being
released into the semi-wild.

21:17.862 --> 21:18.862
[Rob] Watch your bum.

21:20.517 --> 21:22.103
You sneaky little boy.

21:23.344 --> 21:24.424
[Rob] I think he likes you.

21:26.827 --> 21:29.896
I'm hoping our relationship
gets stronger on this trip.

21:29.931 --> 21:32.965
That's the big
driver, I think, for me.

21:33.000 --> 21:37.137
[Rob] Aw, look at him, sitting
and watching, enjoying the show.

21:37.172 --> 21:41.931
When I lost my hearing, for
me and Jen, turned from kind of a

21:41.965 --> 21:46.655
loving, exciting relationship to
almost like a patient-carer relationship.

21:46.689 --> 21:49.862
That's not what you
want out of a marriage.

21:52.310 --> 21:53.830
[Jen] So much
better already, isn't it?

21:54.206 --> 21:55.620
Yeah.

21:55.655 --> 21:57.175
[Jen] Quite nice
flooring beneath here.

21:58.862 --> 22:01.482
It's like we've paused
the relationship,

22:01.517 --> 22:02.896
had a bit of a dodgy time.

22:02.931 --> 22:04.872
I'm now kind of building
him back up and then we'll...

22:04.896 --> 22:07.000
We'll just hit play
and we'll be off again.

22:08.379 --> 22:09.896
[Jen] Making such good progress.

22:11.241 --> 22:13.000
- [Rob] Good.
- [Jen] Great job.

22:14.172 --> 22:16.655
We're just taking
this little bit of a stop,

22:16.689 --> 22:18.275
just to work out
how to go forward.

22:20.344 --> 22:21.448
[Jen] Eggs?

22:21.482 --> 22:23.413
- [Man] Si, vamos.
- [Jen] The eat eggs.

22:24.551 --> 22:26.413
That's a lot of eggs,
you're having me on.

22:27.517 --> 22:29.931
- [Rob] Oh, fish fingers...
- [Jen] Oh...

22:29.965 --> 22:31.931
[Jen] Did you order
some eggs and some fish?

22:34.689 --> 22:38.344
[Jen] Calm down, boys.
There's enough for everybody.

22:38.379 --> 22:41.827
For Jen, you can see
her confidence growing

22:41.862 --> 22:43.907
with each time she gets
pushed out of her comfort zone.

22:43.931 --> 22:45.206
[Jen] Ready?

22:45.241 --> 22:47.758
And I think that's making her
a happier person which is nice

22:48.655 --> 22:50.655
and that, that makes me happy.

22:50.689 --> 22:52.724
[Jen] You take the top
off and look at the middle.

22:52.758 --> 22:54.310
[Rob] Really?

22:54.344 --> 22:58.275
I think race is the first time we've
spent so much time together, isn't it?

22:58.310 --> 23:01.068
And I've really enjoyed it.

23:01.103 --> 23:03.034
[Rob] This experience
has kind of made me feel

23:03.068 --> 23:04.931
I would like to have a
family at some point.

23:04.965 --> 23:07.586
Yeah, one day I want to have
a baby. Probably not right now.

23:07.620 --> 23:09.551
[Rob] Talk about our
future often, don't we?

23:09.586 --> 23:11.251
Yeah, I could suppose
that next year, next year.

23:11.275 --> 23:13.000
'Cause we talk about
it, then I decide, nah.

23:13.034 --> 23:14.241
Definitely next year again.

23:14.275 --> 23:15.827
Doesn't he have two fish snacks?

23:15.862 --> 23:18.482
[Jen] No, he won't. Oh, dear.

23:18.517 --> 23:20.896
Don't overfeed the
kids like this, man.

23:20.931 --> 23:23.148
[Rob] There's never gonna be
a perfect time though, is there?

23:23.172 --> 23:25.413
[Jen] Please. I'm not having
a baby right now. Thank you.

23:25.448 --> 23:27.251
Didn't the spreadsheet tell
how the finances worked?

23:27.275 --> 23:28.435
How we can't afford it. Boom.

23:36.482 --> 23:39.965
Welcome to this
family in winter.

23:40.000 --> 23:40.931
I thank you very much.

23:40.965 --> 23:42.286
Thank you. Thank
you for accepting us.

23:42.310 --> 23:43.941
- [Chako] Gracias.
- [Jamiul] Oh, beautiful.

23:43.965 --> 23:45.896
[Chako] Now, we go
to prepare this rich...

23:45.931 --> 23:47.586
[Jamiul] Okay.

23:47.620 --> 23:50.793
[Narrator] And when chako, emon
and jamiul are turning their day's catch,

23:50.827 --> 23:52.758
into a traditional
Peruvian meal.

23:53.862 --> 23:55.462
[Chako] Hey, you have
a good thing, yeah?

23:57.068 --> 23:59.896
[Narrator] Ceviche is a
national dish of raw fish,

23:59.931 --> 24:02.862
cured in lime juice,
herbs and chilli.

24:02.896 --> 24:05.275
- It's spicy, that.
- Oh, that's good.

24:07.310 --> 24:09.241
[Emon] Do you often
cook with your dad?

24:09.275 --> 24:12.275
[Man] Yeah, my fire. He's
my teacher for cooking.

24:12.310 --> 24:14.793
Yeah? Only as
good as our teachers.

24:16.586 --> 24:19.517
The race set that. Sometimes you
just have been so well connected.

24:19.551 --> 24:23.206
You can tell the bond between
them. I envy what they've got.

24:23.241 --> 24:25.965
Something I never had
with my dad and I liked that.

24:26.482 --> 24:27.482
[Man] Bon appetit.

24:28.896 --> 24:30.068
That's good, man.

24:30.103 --> 24:32.044
For me it's one of the best
experiences that I've had.

24:32.068 --> 24:33.458
Because I got to
meet you and your dad.

24:33.482 --> 24:36.689
We went out fishing. We caught
and cooked together, we eat together.

24:36.724 --> 24:38.044
That's the way a
family should be.

24:39.068 --> 24:42.344
This trip has allowed me to
question all my relationships

24:42.379 --> 24:44.862
that was absent for a
substantial period of time

24:44.896 --> 24:47.689
from the family, from my dad and
mom and my brothers and sisters.

24:47.724 --> 24:49.241
And I do regret that.

24:49.275 --> 24:51.689
But still got a chance
to make up for lost time.

24:51.724 --> 24:54.724
And it is something that I am
gonna pursue when I go home.

24:54.758 --> 24:56.965
I'm gonna actively get
to know them better.

24:57.655 --> 24:59.344
[Speaking foreign language]

24:59.379 --> 25:00.655
[Jamiul] It's really good.

25:01.965 --> 25:05.068
[Emon] Really good. I find it
wonderful how you and your dad

25:05.103 --> 25:08.689
[chako] Yeah. I think all my
life to stay with him together

25:09.379 --> 25:10.482
we are a good team.

25:11.793 --> 25:16.275
I feel like I'm back at
home, eating with the family.

25:16.310 --> 25:18.172
[Chako] It's very important
you remember this.

25:18.206 --> 25:20.689
Yes, I will remember
this for the rest of my life.

25:20.724 --> 25:23.413
When I have children I will
tell them, John and sanchos,

25:23.448 --> 25:24.931
"look after me."

25:24.965 --> 25:28.172
Hopefully I'm gonna be
making my own family very soon.

25:28.206 --> 25:31.034
[Emon] It is something that I
ideally want for my children.

25:31.068 --> 25:33.655
To have that special
bond. I'd be a happy man.

25:35.793 --> 25:38.793
Fresh fish has
a lot of phosphor,

25:38.827 --> 25:39.931
okay.

25:39.965 --> 25:43.206
And then you, lot of
energy, you know, with a girl,

25:43.241 --> 25:47.103
so, impossible to have
no one kid, no two kids.

25:47.137 --> 25:50.965
- It's possible, 14, 15 kids.
- Wow.

25:51.000 --> 25:54.758
- Okay.
- The parents of my father, 18,

25:54.793 --> 25:56.551
- 18 kids?
- 18 kids.

25:56.586 --> 25:59.620
[Chako] 'Cause it's too much
energy, you know, for your body.

25:59.655 --> 26:01.862
- Oh, I'm drunk little bit.
- Yes.

26:08.413 --> 26:11.965
Good, god.
Spatchcock Guinea pig?

26:12.000 --> 26:16.896
[Narrator] At chappari, Jen and Rob
have earned the quivalent of twenty pounds.

26:16.931 --> 26:20.517
Also included, a room for
the night, and an evening meal.

26:20.551 --> 26:22.482
[Rob] You know, I'm
not gonna try any of it.

26:22.517 --> 26:24.724
I believe that you should
try eating but I can't eat

26:24.758 --> 26:27.862
my favorite pet
in the whole world.

26:27.896 --> 26:29.965
[Narrator] Guinea
pig, historically,

26:30.000 --> 26:31.758
a delicacy in Peru.

26:34.241 --> 26:35.896
Oh, god.

26:35.931 --> 26:39.482
[Narrator] Narrow success story in the
nation's struggle with child malnutrition.

26:40.793 --> 26:42.241
That could be chicken.

26:42.275 --> 26:44.724
- Really?
- Yeah, it's nice.

26:44.758 --> 26:49.931
[Narrator] While the couple settle in for
the night, the other teams are on the move.

26:49.965 --> 26:51.655
We're back on another bus.

26:51.689 --> 26:53.103
It's been the day of my life.

26:55.379 --> 26:56.769
[Narrator] Travelling
through the night

26:56.793 --> 27:00.655
along the coastal highway,
towards Peru's main transport hub,

27:03.620 --> 27:06.344
the nation's capital, Lima.

27:06.379 --> 27:09.413
Known by the Spanish
as the city of kings.

27:09.448 --> 27:13.413
Today, it's home to
one-third of Peru's population.

27:13.448 --> 27:15.862
Three million of
whom, live in favelas.

27:15.896 --> 27:18.896
Or pueblos jÃ³venes, young towns.

27:23.931 --> 27:27.241
This must be about her life.
Where is it, to Santa Maria.

27:27.275 --> 27:30.103
It's mine. I can't
understand any of it.

27:30.137 --> 27:34.344
[Narrator] Dom and Lizzie are visiting
the catholic church of Santa Rosa of Lima,

27:34.379 --> 27:36.172
the patron Saint of Peru,

27:36.206 --> 27:38.655
who cared for the
city's sick and poor.

27:39.965 --> 27:42.724
[Dom] I still wonder why...
How much such a specific,

27:42.758 --> 27:44.758
age did the same thing for you.

27:44.793 --> 27:47.896
Maybe because Saint Rosa
took in people who were in poverty

27:47.931 --> 27:50.771
and were sick, needed help, that's a
reflection of what grandma was like.

27:53.034 --> 27:54.965
-Maybe -she wants
me to be like that.

27:55.000 --> 27:56.000
Maybe she... yeah.

27:57.448 --> 28:00.172
[Dom] Very recently, our
grandma passed away.

28:01.344 --> 28:04.551
- I won't talk about grandma.
- I'll talk.

28:04.586 --> 28:08.344
[Dom] She was a very inspirational
person in life, wasn't she?

28:08.379 --> 28:09.517
[Lizzie] Yeah.

28:09.551 --> 28:11.689
[Dom] I think we should
light a candle for grandma.

28:11.724 --> 28:14.413
[Lizzie] Yeah, I think
that's a nice idea.

28:14.448 --> 28:17.620
A lot of the skills we're gonna
have to channel into the race,

28:17.655 --> 28:19.310
are things that she's taught us.

28:19.344 --> 28:21.493
[Lizzie] She taught us to
never judge anyone for anything.

28:21.517 --> 28:26.206
At the end of the day, just get
your head down and get on with it.

28:26.241 --> 28:28.793
She'd be so excited
for us to do this,

28:28.827 --> 28:31.896
and I wanna do it for her.

28:31.931 --> 28:34.724
To show that we loved her loads.

28:34.758 --> 28:35.998
- That was just for her.
- Yeah.

28:37.896 --> 28:39.896
We left so soon
after her passing,

28:39.931 --> 28:42.310
that we did not have a chance
to say good bye or anything.

28:42.344 --> 28:44.896
That was a nice
way to ackowledge it.

28:44.931 --> 28:46.344
And thought she's
watching over us.

28:50.689 --> 28:52.241
Oh, yeah. Is it me?

28:54.896 --> 28:56.000
That's enough.

28:56.689 --> 28:57.827
I am...

28:57.862 --> 29:00.482
You're never travelling
any other way.

29:00.517 --> 29:03.344
[Narrator] Having paid a
premium to travel in style,

29:03.379 --> 29:05.482
Jo and Sam are
about to arrive in Lima.

29:06.655 --> 29:09.482
And then we'll get the
earliest bus possible.

29:09.517 --> 29:13.241
One to ica, I'm going
to the fabolous desert.

29:13.275 --> 29:15.620
Yeah, I think that'll
be really good.

29:15.655 --> 29:18.655
[Narrator] With a plan to follow
the coast as long as possible,

29:18.689 --> 29:23.068
mother and son are heading
to the desert oasis of ica.

29:23.103 --> 29:27.310
From there, they'll be well positioned to
start the resent towards the checkpoiint.

29:28.827 --> 29:31.551
Krispy kreme's.
Are you having a lot?

29:31.586 --> 29:33.000
[Jo] Sam, Sam, Sam, Sam, calm.

29:33.034 --> 29:34.931
No.

29:34.965 --> 29:37.758
[Narrator] But first a
pit stop in the capital.

29:37.793 --> 29:39.965
To satify Sam's food cravings.

29:40.758 --> 29:43.620
Oh, there's Chinese, I am in.

29:43.655 --> 29:47.137
But with their budget starting
to suffer. Jo's hoping a visit

29:47.172 --> 29:48.724
to Lima's central market,

29:48.758 --> 29:52.448
will help take them away from
the expensive American imports.

29:56.172 --> 29:57.793
What is that?

29:57.827 --> 30:00.482
I like Chinese. I
don't want hamster.

30:00.517 --> 30:02.117
You need to try
stuff, you haven't tried.

30:03.482 --> 30:06.000
With papaya.

30:06.034 --> 30:11.310
From a young child, I used to
love filling my face with food.

30:11.344 --> 30:14.586
I put so much food in my mouth
that I won't be able to chew it.

30:14.620 --> 30:18.275
What, what? Nutella.

30:18.310 --> 30:20.448
I love all the beautiful fruits

30:20.482 --> 30:22.344
and you go for
the crappy sweets?

30:22.379 --> 30:26.241
[Sam] Back at home, I eat,
like, five sandwiches at lunch.

30:26.275 --> 30:29.310
I don't make sandwiches, I go to
the shop and buy, like, five meal deals.

30:29.344 --> 30:32.931
Get about five takeaways
a week, any food I want.

30:32.965 --> 30:35.010
Here, it's a lot different
'cause we're under budget.

30:35.034 --> 30:37.172
- Is that a banana?
- It is.

30:37.206 --> 30:39.103
That's a big banana.

30:39.137 --> 30:43.103
When he was in school, he
used to be on adhd medication.

30:43.137 --> 30:47.482
So he would have no appetite.
And then, when the drugs wore off,

30:47.517 --> 30:49.413
he would be desperate to eat.

30:49.448 --> 30:54.517
And I think the restriction on
food does, sort of, stress him out.

30:54.551 --> 30:56.862
- [Speaking other language]
- Ah, sea urchin.

30:56.896 --> 31:00.448
-Let's try it.
-No, that's for you. I'll walk off.

31:00.482 --> 31:02.965
The initial reason
for coming on the race

31:03.000 --> 31:05.482
was, really, for Sam
to discover the world.

31:05.517 --> 31:07.482
Stepping out of
his comfort zone.

31:08.379 --> 31:11.241
- No!
- Oh!

31:11.275 --> 31:15.137
Trying new things. There is
lots to discover in terms of food.

31:15.172 --> 31:20.965
Mom's buying a sea urchin. If anyone
thinks I'm eating that, they are wrong.

31:21.000 --> 31:23.896
This is why we're traveling,
to try these new things.

31:23.931 --> 31:25.517
- You gonna go for it?
- No.

31:25.551 --> 31:26.724
Okay.

31:28.275 --> 31:29.551
It's actually quite nice.

31:29.586 --> 31:31.689
- Sure, I'm done.
- Seriously.

31:31.724 --> 31:35.275
- I'm done.
- It's okay. Try the end bit.

31:35.310 --> 31:37.379
It's not as fishy as
crab or anything.

31:37.413 --> 31:40.758
It basically tastes crunchy and
then you get a bit of a sea taste.

31:41.931 --> 31:43.827
Oh, my god.

31:45.689 --> 31:47.379
It's not so bad, is it?

31:47.413 --> 31:49.758
-Yeah, you're right. It just tastes like the sea.
-Yeah.

31:56.482 --> 31:58.103
We need to get a
move on and get asking,

31:58.137 --> 32:01.068
'cause we're getting later and
later into the afternoon now.

32:01.103 --> 32:04.275
[Narrator] Planning how to
leave Lima, dom and Lizzie...

32:04.310 --> 32:07.793
- They look English.
- Does that mean they'll know how to get a bus to to cusco?

32:07.827 --> 32:10.379
- I think we shold ask them.
- Go on, then.

32:10.413 --> 32:13.482
- Can you come with me?
- Yeah, I'll come with you but I'm not asking.

32:13.517 --> 32:14.734
[Narrator] The
siblings are aiming

32:14.758 --> 32:17.206
to undertake the steepest
climb to the checkpoint

32:17.241 --> 32:21.620
traveling high up in the
andes via the city of cusco

32:21.655 --> 32:25.344
but first, they need to
figure out how to get there.

32:25.379 --> 32:28.241
- Are we gonna stand here?
- I don't know what to do, dom.

32:30.137 --> 32:32.862
I do worry about Lizzie's
lack of self-confidence.

32:32.896 --> 32:37.344
When we used to go shopping,
she would refuse to go to the checkout

32:37.379 --> 32:40.586
'cause she had a lack of
confidence to speak to a stranger

32:40.620 --> 32:42.482
or carry out a simple task.

32:42.517 --> 32:45.931
I just don't wanna have
a dead-end conversation.

32:45.965 --> 32:48.344
- There's no harm in asking.
- Okay.

32:48.379 --> 32:51.896
- I can't approach people.
- Well, that's something

32:51.931 --> 32:54.034
you're gonna have to
learn to do in this race.

32:54.068 --> 32:57.482
Sometimes, I wanna shake
her and I want her to realise that

32:57.517 --> 32:59.344
she shouldn't
think so negatively.

32:59.379 --> 33:04.724
She is really smart, but I can see it in her
eyes that she thinks that she's not able.

33:04.758 --> 33:07.172
- Just sick and tired of you.
- Me?

33:07.206 --> 33:09.206
Yeah, making me do
things I don't wanna do.

33:09.241 --> 33:11.724
- I know. I know.
- It's exhausting.

33:11.758 --> 33:13.379
I know it's
difficult, but, like...

33:15.172 --> 33:16.965
As you said, we're a team.

33:17.000 --> 33:19.448
- That dog's cute.
- Lizzie, shut up about the dog, all right?

33:19.482 --> 33:22.827
You're gonna have to, like,
take your weight a little bit.

33:22.862 --> 33:25.034
- That's not fair.
- What?

33:25.068 --> 33:26.907
I am trying to help you
with your self-confidence.

33:26.931 --> 33:29.413
And it's not gonna help
by just following me around

33:29.448 --> 33:31.862
when I'm asking
people where to go.

33:31.896 --> 33:33.413
- Do you wanna ask him?
- Yeah.

33:33.448 --> 33:36.068
Okay. Initiate.

33:36.103 --> 33:38.724
Do you speak English?

33:38.758 --> 33:41.379
- Uh... so, so...
- Yeah?

33:41.413 --> 33:45.482
- We're trying to find a bus terminal.
- To cusco.

33:45.517 --> 33:48.206
- If we can get a taxi...
- Terminal to get to cusco?

33:48.241 --> 33:50.310
Yes, it's... [speaks Spanish]

33:50.344 --> 33:56.655
- To cusco is 22 hours or maybe 20.
- Okay.

33:56.689 --> 33:59.734
[Automated voice] To know what time the
bus leaves, you have to go to the terminal

33:59.758 --> 34:01.482
- and buy tickets.
- Okay, okay.

34:01.517 --> 34:02.689
Perfect, that was very good.

34:06.000 --> 34:09.482
Well, I think we've got
two options to get to puno.

34:09.517 --> 34:11.379
We either go to Lima,
or we go to arequipa.

34:11.413 --> 34:12.965
We should work
out the logistics.

34:15.137 --> 34:17.000
Lima or arequipa.

34:17.965 --> 34:19.620
I want to go to Lima.

34:19.655 --> 34:22.379
We need to make sure we're
using our time effectively.

34:22.413 --> 34:26.000
We don't know how we are
going to deal with the altitude.

34:26.034 --> 34:27.458
[Narrator] On the
road from chaparri,

34:27.482 --> 34:30.413
Jen and Rob are
planning their next move.

34:30.448 --> 34:34.344
To break their journey in the
capital or continue further south

34:34.379 --> 34:39.620
to acclimatize in arequipa, just
over 2,000 meters above sea level.

34:39.655 --> 34:42.724
Arequipa offers
us a slower ascent.

34:42.758 --> 34:44.586
I don't like the word slow.

34:44.620 --> 34:49.068
We'll probably get there dizzy than
get there 5 days later feeling quite well.

34:49.103 --> 34:52.172
The risk, though, is
that we get sent back.

34:52.206 --> 34:55.068
The route going
to arequipa is right.

34:55.103 --> 34:57.000
[Jen] Oh, hubby.

34:57.034 --> 35:00.517
Rob's decided on a more
cautious approach to the checkpoint.

35:01.896 --> 35:05.344
Meanwhile, two teams
are taking a riskier route

35:05.379 --> 35:08.896
and starting their steep
ascent into the mountains.

35:08.931 --> 35:12.896
We're actually climbing quite
a bit of altitude here right now.

35:14.137 --> 35:16.620
So, some of us might
experience altitude sickness,

35:16.655 --> 35:19.344
I'm not sure if I will, myself.

35:19.379 --> 35:21.206
Hopefully not.

35:21.241 --> 35:24.137
I guess my asthma combined
is not a good combination.

35:25.448 --> 35:27.034
We're pretty high up.

35:27.068 --> 35:29.448
- And the roads are pretty windy.
- Yeah.

35:29.482 --> 35:31.689
- My tummy isn't steady.
- Yeah.

35:31.724 --> 35:34.586
I feel like I've gone
on high from drinking.

35:34.620 --> 35:36.241
My eyes are gonna
pop out of my had.

35:36.275 --> 35:38.241
[Groans]

35:38.275 --> 35:40.034
This is you... [mimics].

35:40.068 --> 35:42.068
Dom, I don't think you
understand my sinus.

35:46.965 --> 35:50.344
[Narrator] At 3,400
meters above sea level,

35:50.379 --> 35:53.758
cusco, the capital
of the inca empire,

35:53.793 --> 35:55.793
famed for its ancient walls.

35:55.827 --> 35:59.517
Masterfully engineered,
they've endured for centuries.

36:01.241 --> 36:06.275
- Whoo! [Groans]
- That was a long one. Whoo.

36:06.310 --> 36:08.482
[Narrator] Its altitude
makes it an ideal base

36:08.517 --> 36:11.517
for expeditions
higher into the andes.

36:11.551 --> 36:15.689
This is a different sort of
weather than we're used to.

36:15.724 --> 36:18.344
[Narrator] Before making
their way to puno tomorrow,

36:18.379 --> 36:20.551
emon and jamiul
are planning to trek

36:20.586 --> 36:22.517
to one of Peru's
most magical sites.

36:23.413 --> 36:25.379
What time do you
go rainbow mountain?

36:25.413 --> 36:28.827
- Can we go there today?
- No, tomorrow, because

36:30.000 --> 36:35.551
the tourist Van went
5:30 morning until 6:00pm.

36:35.586 --> 36:39.758
-So we can't go now?
-No, it's too late now. It's not wise.

36:39.793 --> 36:42.793
[Narrator] With no transport to
the foot of the mountain today,

36:42.827 --> 36:44.482
it's a big decision.

36:44.517 --> 36:47.379
Obviously, it is a wonder of the
world and the rainbow mountains...

36:47.413 --> 36:49.689
Yeah, but at what cost
are we giving it up anyway?

36:49.724 --> 36:51.620
Is it worth it? It's a
three-hour journey.

36:51.655 --> 36:54.310
We ain't got the time. It's probably
gonna take about five hours.

36:54.344 --> 36:56.172
A full day, basically.

36:56.206 --> 36:58.689
I actually didn't think that it
was so high, I'm not gonna lie.

36:58.724 --> 37:01.137
You're the one that's got
the asthma and can't inhale.

37:01.172 --> 37:02.586
That's what concerns me.

37:02.620 --> 37:06.310
If it's gonna be a sacrifice
to your health and the race,

37:06.344 --> 37:10.620
even at that altitude, it takes a
couple of days to get back to normal.

37:10.655 --> 37:13.655
I do worry about him.
He' s a grown adult now,

37:13.689 --> 37:16.275
but he's always be my
nephew no matter how old he is.

37:16.310 --> 37:17.827
I'll always worry about him.

37:17.862 --> 37:20.562
I know everything that you said is
right. It's my concern as well, yeah?

37:20.586 --> 37:23.827
But then, if I could see
those sorts of landscapes,

37:23.862 --> 37:25.137
it's gonna be worth it.

37:25.172 --> 37:26.793
Yeah, it would be amazing.

37:26.827 --> 37:31.172
What I aim to get out of this
trip is a bond with my uncle

37:31.206 --> 37:35.275
so that we can have memories.
Memories that we don't have,

37:35.310 --> 37:36.896
because we couldn't have.

37:36.931 --> 37:39.551
That's how you
want to know family

37:39.586 --> 37:42.965
and you can't break those sorts of
bonds. That's where love comes from.

37:43.000 --> 37:45.758
We want to go to rainbow
mountain tomorrow.

37:45.793 --> 37:48.068
Special price, 60 sol.

37:48.103 --> 37:49.793
Sixty sol, special price? Okay.

37:50.862 --> 37:52.827
- Let's go get some food or something.
- Yeah.

37:52.862 --> 37:54.034
Come on, then.

37:57.172 --> 38:00.068
[Narrator] Eight hundred
kilometres west...

38:00.103 --> 38:02.310
[Both] This is real desert.

38:02.344 --> 38:05.413
If you imagine the Sahara
desert, this is what I'd imagine.

38:05.448 --> 38:06.758
Yeah.

38:06.793 --> 38:09.344
[Narrator] Yet to head
inland to start their ascent.

38:09.379 --> 38:14.482
Jo and Sam are on the fringes of the
atacama desert on the pacific coast.

38:14.517 --> 38:17.620
A 1,000 kilometer
expanse of arid landscape

38:17.655 --> 38:21.000
stretching from Peru to Chile.

38:21.034 --> 38:23.275
- [Jo] Oh, wow.
- This is peculiar looking.

38:23.310 --> 38:26.655
We're in the middle of a
desert and there's a lake.

38:26.689 --> 38:29.448
- It's weird. Do you reckon there are crocodiles in there?
- No.

38:29.482 --> 38:31.862
It's an oasis. The
water comes from below.

38:31.896 --> 38:34.862
- I thought htat was a spring.
- Well, it sort of is

38:34.896 --> 38:37.931
but it's got an oasis
in a desert, so...

38:37.965 --> 38:40.689
I wanna get on a boogie
board and do what he's doing.

38:47.793 --> 38:49.344
Woo-hoo!

38:56.827 --> 38:58.931
- [Sam] Now this is fun.
- Yeah it is!

39:04.103 --> 39:06.172
[Sam] Whee! [Laughs]

39:07.517 --> 39:09.103
[Jo] Whee! Oh, [bleep]!

39:16.172 --> 39:18.000
Wow, look at the sun go down.

39:18.034 --> 39:19.827
- That is amazing.
- That is beautiful

39:19.862 --> 39:22.241
and worth all the tough
times in the last four weeks.

39:22.275 --> 39:24.482
Aye, been good.

39:24.517 --> 39:27.206
So, how many 19-year-olds
can travel with their mum?

39:27.241 --> 39:30.241
Yeah, probably just you, really.

39:30.275 --> 39:32.517
You know, it's contentious,
we've got a long journey,

39:32.551 --> 39:35.448
we're trying to balance
it with enjoying ourselves

39:35.482 --> 39:36.931
but also have a budget.

39:36.965 --> 39:40.655
There's bound to be stresses. I
think our relationship is still intact

39:40.689 --> 39:44.000
even if you find me slightly
more irritating than you used to.

39:45.517 --> 39:48.827
[Narrator] Keeping their
relationship intact may seem priceless

39:48.862 --> 39:52.275
but it does come
at a financial cost.

39:52.310 --> 39:54.950
- It's been really good fun.
- Now I'm gonna beat you to the bottom.

39:57.896 --> 40:00.965
You're clearly more
aerodynamic than me.

40:02.275 --> 40:05.862
Dom and I happened to
pick up a shift for a nightclub

40:05.896 --> 40:07.310
for a few hours.

40:07.344 --> 40:10.137
There are a few
really annoying people

40:10.172 --> 40:11.655
but we need the money.

40:11.689 --> 40:15.517
[Narrator] Arriving in cusco,
in a bid to boost their budget,

40:15.551 --> 40:16.620
dom and Lizzie...

40:16.655 --> 40:18.655
Hi, welcome.

40:18.689 --> 40:22.965
Your work, give this to the
people in the main square.

40:23.000 --> 40:25.206
Each bill, it's a free shot.

40:25.241 --> 40:28.896
- If you make people come here...
- Come here.

40:28.931 --> 40:32.586
Yeah, exactly.
We share the tips.

40:32.620 --> 40:34.448
Let's go.

40:34.482 --> 40:37.620
I want half. All right,
done. Off you go.

40:37.655 --> 40:39.620
I don't think this
is Lizzie's forte.

40:39.655 --> 40:42.000
Hello, a few shots? No?

40:44.413 --> 40:46.482
Hi, guys. How are
you this evening?

40:46.517 --> 40:48.000
Free shots? No?

40:49.413 --> 40:52.551
How have I ended
up pub side by myself?

40:52.586 --> 40:55.793
And Liz is inside there in
the warm having a cup of tea.

40:55.827 --> 40:59.448
[Groans] The
lonely work of a flyer.

40:59.482 --> 41:01.827
- Are you proud of being Peruvian?
- Yeah.

41:01.862 --> 41:04.482
- I love live here.
- Yeah.

41:04.517 --> 41:07.758
- And do you go to school?
- Actually, I'm going to the university.

41:07.793 --> 41:08.965
- Now?
- Yeah.

41:09.000 --> 41:11.103
- Do you study too?
- I did.

41:11.137 --> 41:12.517
But I stopped studying now.

41:12.551 --> 41:14.586
I left 'cause I didn't like it.

41:16.413 --> 41:19.206
Earlier this year, I
dropped out of university.

41:19.241 --> 41:21.655
I was watching all my friends
around me doing so well

41:21.689 --> 41:24.379
and I did feel a
bit like a failure

41:24.413 --> 41:26.482
and it was quite hard a
decision for me to make,

41:26.517 --> 41:28.344
I knew by the time I
got to my third year,

41:28.379 --> 41:30.206
where I was wasn't
the right place

41:30.241 --> 41:31.527
and I knew it
wasn't right for me.

41:31.551 --> 41:32.862
- What do you study?
- Law.

41:32.896 --> 41:34.620
- Law, oh, wow, really?
- Yeah.

41:34.655 --> 41:38.206
- Do you wanna be a lawyer?
- Yeah. I want help to the people.

41:38.241 --> 41:40.586
- Do you?
- Yeah. We need justice.

41:40.620 --> 41:44.137
Yeah. It's nice to hear that
you've got such a clear path

41:44.172 --> 41:46.344
and you really want
to do something

41:46.379 --> 41:48.793
'cause I have no
idea what I want to do.

41:48.827 --> 41:51.482
I'm a bit lost, really.

41:51.517 --> 41:53.793
I feel like my future at the
moment is quite uncertain

41:53.827 --> 41:56.206
but this race has
come at the perfect time

41:56.241 --> 41:59.482
and I need this experience to
really give me some direction

41:59.517 --> 42:02.551
and some motivation as to
where I'm going to go next.

42:02.586 --> 42:05.586
You seem to... You saying about
giving back to your community,

42:05.620 --> 42:08.379
and wanting to help others
is quite inspiring to me.

42:08.413 --> 42:10.000
That's something
I'm slowly learning

42:10.034 --> 42:11.493
whilst traveling to
all these countries

42:11.517 --> 42:14.172
is that there's a much
greater sense of community.

42:14.206 --> 42:15.413
Yeah.

42:18.172 --> 42:21.862
There is a bar just up there that's
giving free shots if you're interested.

42:21.896 --> 42:24.241
- I think we are okay.
- You okay?

42:24.275 --> 42:25.413
You headed back home.

42:25.448 --> 42:27.206
- Ok, well...
- Thank you.âªâª

42:27.241 --> 42:28.655
- Have a good night.
- You too.

42:28.689 --> 42:30.310
Hi, guys. How are
you this evening?

42:30.344 --> 42:31.965
No? See you later.

42:33.689 --> 42:37.551
I think you need
to find your way.

42:37.586 --> 42:41.896
What do you want to do
for the rest of your life?

42:41.931 --> 42:44.206
- I think that...
- What's going on there?

42:45.931 --> 42:48.000
- Working hours!
- Oh my, god.

42:48.034 --> 42:50.965
- I was not very successful.
- Yeah, we think so.

42:51.000 --> 42:55.172
I get walking up to people like
free shots, and they were just

42:55.206 --> 42:56.413
I will pay you.

42:56.448 --> 42:57.862
- Okay.
- Really?

42:57.896 --> 42:59.482
Will be one hundred solace.

42:59.517 --> 43:00.827
That's more than we deserve.

43:00.862 --> 43:03.413
- Yeah? Don't worry.
- We like it.

43:03.448 --> 43:05.517
Ruthful, taking of
hers to the middle.

43:05.551 --> 43:07.758
- Good luck, with your trip.
- Ba-bye.

43:07.793 --> 43:09.172
Thank you.

43:24.551 --> 43:25.751
[Contestant] Oh, it feels good.

43:28.103 --> 43:31.137
I made it. We got a
long way to go pal.

43:31.172 --> 43:35.482
[Narrator] Emon and jamiul are embarking
on their expedition up rainbow mountain.

43:39.482 --> 43:41.931
Until 2015.

43:41.965 --> 43:45.482
The peaks lay undiscovered
beneath layers of snow,

43:45.517 --> 43:47.206
but the effects of
climate change have

43:47.241 --> 43:50.103
caused them to melt away,
revealing the mountains

43:50.137 --> 43:54.000
colorful stripes made up
fourteen different minerals.

44:00.379 --> 44:02.344
[Narrator continues]
It's a two hour ascent.

44:02.379 --> 44:04.896
And at this altitude,
the lungs can only take

44:04.931 --> 44:07.551
in half the amount of
oxygen than at sea level.

44:09.172 --> 44:11.689
That street is feeling
quite heavy today.

44:11.724 --> 44:15.000
To be honest with you,

44:15.034 --> 44:19.517
it's all right. I think I
can, uh, fight through it.

44:19.965 --> 44:20.965
Let's do this.

44:28.000 --> 44:29.758
By the start of Everest,

44:29.793 --> 44:34.034
have a bit, with many people.

44:35.241 --> 44:37.793
I've climbed various
mountains across the world,

44:37.827 --> 44:39.655
including Everest.

44:39.689 --> 44:43.310
But most important thing to me about
this trip is the relationship with jamiul.

44:44.793 --> 44:46.655
[In Welsh accent]
The rainbow mountain.

44:46.689 --> 44:49.034
Where are you getting
this accent from?

44:49.068 --> 44:50.206
It's a Welsh accent.

44:50.241 --> 44:52.586
[In Welsh accent]
Rainbow mountain.

44:52.620 --> 44:54.275
Look at the very queue going up.

44:54.310 --> 44:55.590
[Jamiul] All top
their testicles?

44:56.344 --> 44:57.517
Shoe flat, big journey.

44:58.068 --> 44:59.068
How many shot?

44:59.586 --> 45:01.517
Let's let me that.

45:01.551 --> 45:03.517
[Jamiul] I hope
we get there at all.

45:03.551 --> 45:06.241
[Emon] I'll carry
you if I have to.

45:10.103 --> 45:11.583
I swear this stick
is slowing me down.

45:12.103 --> 45:14.758
[Emon grunts]

45:14.793 --> 45:18.344
[Narrator] The summit at five
thousand two hundred meters

45:18.379 --> 45:23.000
is over four hundred meters higher than
mont blanc. The tallest peak in Europe.

45:25.551 --> 45:28.551
Just hit the dump,
a bit of this weather.

45:31.793 --> 45:32.793
It's snowing.

45:35.310 --> 45:37.448
[Emon] I'm cold.

45:38.620 --> 45:39.860
I'm getting slightly miserable.

45:41.344 --> 45:42.448
Soon as I get there.

45:42.482 --> 45:45.310
If I can do this here. I
can do a hell of a lot more.

45:45.344 --> 45:46.758
I keep pursuit.

45:48.862 --> 45:50.758
- This is yours.
- Yeah.

45:52.620 --> 45:53.820
[Jamiul] Look at those colours.

45:56.172 --> 45:57.931
[Emon] That view is good, init?

45:58.482 --> 45:59.482
We did it.

46:01.586 --> 46:03.137
If anyone can
do it, I can do it.

46:03.172 --> 46:06.448
We actually thought
of, not coming up here,

46:06.482 --> 46:09.862
because of me and the altitude.

46:09.896 --> 46:12.034
[Emon and jamiul]
Mind over mind.

46:14.000 --> 46:16.275
A bloody mule could climb
the mountain. Out of ten years

46:16.310 --> 46:18.172
[jamiul] Out of
touch for ten years.

46:18.206 --> 46:21.241
I feel more close to emon
than I ever have been.

46:22.965 --> 46:24.803
Family. So that's why
it's all about, isn't it.

46:24.827 --> 46:26.482
[Emon] Real proud of ya.

46:29.793 --> 46:32.000
Let's do it.

46:35.241 --> 46:37.286
You got out through sickness.
Are you feeling alright?

46:37.310 --> 46:40.586
My cheek really hurt, but i'm sure that's
got nothing to do with altitude sickness.

46:40.620 --> 46:43.448
It's probably because she
punched me in the mountain, I guess.

46:43.482 --> 46:46.206
It's all twisted and turned
around the mountains

46:46.241 --> 46:48.896
getting thrown
around state of the car.

46:48.931 --> 46:52.862
[Narrator] On their more gradual claim,
Jen and Rob have arrived in arequipa.

46:55.551 --> 46:56.551
[Rob] Thanks.

46:57.689 --> 47:00.137
Let's see if we can
get a bus to puno.

47:00.172 --> 47:03.586
[Jen] We'll start going to all the bus
companies and get times and prices.

47:04.379 --> 47:05.862
Puno?

47:05.896 --> 47:08.586
[Jen] Robbie decided to
come here, and that's fine.

47:08.620 --> 47:12.172
If it isn't the right decision,
he will not hear the end of it.

47:12.206 --> 47:15.000
[People yelling in Spanish]

47:17.896 --> 47:19.206
[Jen] What times do you go?

47:19.241 --> 47:21.310
[Replies in Spanish]

47:21.344 --> 47:25.620
- [Both Jen and Rob] Four?
- Dos personas?

47:25.655 --> 47:27.896
Thirty and thirty.

47:27.931 --> 47:29.562
[Rob] I think I've taken
some good decisions.

47:29.586 --> 47:31.620
Jen struggles with
being told what to do.

47:31.655 --> 47:35.689
So glad I kind of push
Jen to come this way.

47:35.724 --> 47:37.137
Such a beautiful city.

47:38.758 --> 47:40.620
- [Women speaking Spanish]
- These two.

47:40.655 --> 47:42.862
[Jen] We just left our
bags with a random women.

47:42.896 --> 47:45.413
We way may or may
not ever see them again.

47:45.448 --> 47:46.965
I'm done with this day already.

47:47.000 --> 47:48.344
Let's go and enjoy the city

47:48.379 --> 47:50.931
[narrator] In the shadow
of El misti volcano,

47:50.965 --> 47:57.068
colonial arequipa is Peru's second largest
Metropolis, nicknamed the white city

47:57.103 --> 48:01.862
after its unique baroque buildings,
carved from local rock, white.

48:01.896 --> 48:03.620
From solidified volcanic ash.

48:03.655 --> 48:05.551
[Man on speaker]

48:05.586 --> 48:06.866
It looks very grand, doesn't it?

48:07.379 --> 48:09.103
[Jen] Yeah. So far, so good.

48:09.137 --> 48:11.655
I love the palm tree.

48:11.689 --> 48:13.862
- Oh, you want to hold my hand, do you?
- Why not, love.

48:13.896 --> 48:16.931
[Jen] This is very pretty.

48:16.965 --> 48:21.034
Sometimes it's nice for you to
deaf open, just sort things out.

48:21.068 --> 48:22.620
Because I don't
want to all the time.

48:23.586 --> 48:25.551
I feel really guilty when I say,

48:25.586 --> 48:28.241
since his hearing loss, I
have been the strong one.

48:28.275 --> 48:30.482
Not like the man
in the relationship,

48:30.517 --> 48:33.241
but the strong one, the
one he has been like.

48:33.275 --> 48:34.835
Everything is actually
going to be okay.

48:35.689 --> 48:37.344
[Jen] I just want
to eat all of this.

48:37.379 --> 48:40.689
[Rob] As soon as I came out of the operation,
it took me a long time to come around

48:40.724 --> 48:42.524
and just not been able
to do the basic things.

48:42.551 --> 48:44.000
Just like walk to the toilet.

48:44.034 --> 48:46.931
Not being able to
thrive, dependent on Jen

48:46.965 --> 48:50.655
to look after me, to
bathe me, to cook for me.

48:50.689 --> 48:52.000
Absolutely delicious.

48:53.103 --> 48:56.413
So romantic having a stuffed
pepper outside the toilet

48:58.103 --> 49:00.379
his confidence has
been knocked terribly.

49:00.413 --> 49:05.000
I just need to kind of help
him get back to how he was.

49:05.034 --> 49:08.310
I like this city, better of
all the ones we've visited.

49:08.344 --> 49:10.758
I'm looking forward to...

49:10.793 --> 49:13.620
I want to be there
tonight, I want to... yeah.

49:13.655 --> 49:17.055
-We could be there tonight. I think. It's a possibility.
-We need to get there tonight.

49:18.034 --> 49:19.862
Really glad that he
chose to come here.

49:19.896 --> 49:21.769
And I'm glad that he kind
of stood up for himself.

49:21.793 --> 49:25.620
He was adamant on. And
yeah, I'm glad that he was.

49:25.655 --> 49:27.103
Let's just get a shifty on.

49:27.137 --> 49:30.000
- Yeah.
- You've had your fun.

49:30.034 --> 49:32.275
- Come on.
- Had your fun?

49:32.310 --> 49:33.758
Get to view this
beautiful sight.

49:38.068 --> 49:39.655
[Sam] I've got a head ache.

49:39.689 --> 49:42.389
You need to drink a lot, cause it could
be the destructive altitude sickness.

49:42.413 --> 49:44.620
[Narrator] Having
left the cost behind.

49:44.655 --> 49:47.344
Jo and Sam are now
ascending to puno.

49:47.379 --> 49:50.103
If you mention you got like
half enough in checkpoint.

49:50.137 --> 49:52.931
We both would, we will
have to come back down.

49:52.965 --> 49:54.413
- I would not be happy.
- [Jo laugh]

49:55.620 --> 49:58.827
Can we get a direct
bus to puno? From here.

49:58.862 --> 50:03.620
We have to go to cusco, and
take from the buses terminal.

50:03.655 --> 50:05.827
[Narrator] Still at the
base of rainbow mountain.

50:05.862 --> 50:08.655
Emon and jamiul make
the most of local knowledge

50:08.689 --> 50:12.068
to help claw back the
hours they spent tracking.

50:12.103 --> 50:14.413
[Jamiul] Is there a faster
way you can get to, puno?

50:14.448 --> 50:17.034
Yeah. Sicuani is a small town.

50:17.068 --> 50:20.379
You can stop another
bus probably, in the street.

50:20.413 --> 50:21.586
[Emon] You have to stop them.

50:21.620 --> 50:23.724
-[Emon] You just flagged
them down -yes, yes.

50:23.758 --> 50:25.000
That's good, too.

50:27.103 --> 50:29.793
If you do that, all that
time that we've lost,

50:29.827 --> 50:32.310
you could take it back.

50:32.344 --> 50:35.551
[Narrator] With cusco, a
three hour descent away,

50:35.586 --> 50:37.413
a possible shortcut through

50:37.448 --> 50:39.379
the mountain village of sicuani

50:39.413 --> 50:42.551
could shave hours
off the journey,

50:42.586 --> 50:45.689
but they have no idea
what time a bus will turn up.

50:45.724 --> 50:49.034
Or even if it'll stop if
they try to flag it down.

50:49.068 --> 50:50.482
This is all about gumbel's.

50:52.448 --> 50:54.517
You got to make bold decisions.

50:54.551 --> 50:56.655
No you didn't,
before it paid off.

50:56.689 --> 50:58.689
[Man speaking foreign language]

51:01.241 --> 51:03.862
- It's still quite early so.
- Early.

51:04.655 --> 51:06.000
Sort of the, uh, bus is going.

51:17.068 --> 51:18.068
[Emon] Is that it?

51:18.551 --> 51:19.551
[Jamiul] This is it.

51:20.413 --> 51:21.724
This one, yeah?

51:24.310 --> 51:25.310
Yeah, this is him.

51:29.275 --> 51:30.724
I have never got
in a bus that quick.

51:33.655 --> 51:38.068
[Narrator] As emon and jamiul's,
gamble gets them back in the race.

51:38.103 --> 51:41.827
I think, we need to just get to the bus
station because there's no point looking

51:41.862 --> 51:44.034
for buses around here,
cause they'll be expensive.

51:44.068 --> 51:46.655
[Narrator] A hundred and
forty kilometers downhill.

51:46.689 --> 51:49.068
Dom and Lizzie are
yet to leave cusco.

51:49.103 --> 51:50.172
[Dom] I have no coat.

51:50.206 --> 51:51.862
And now I have a waterproof.

51:51.896 --> 51:54.482
Can you help it go over my back?

51:54.517 --> 51:56.113
[Lizzie] It's not going
to fail you, that one.

51:56.137 --> 51:58.482
[Dom] Well, well, well.

51:59.137 --> 52:01.172
Force it up. Pull it.

52:01.206 --> 52:03.448
[Dom] Pull it, pull it.

52:12.827 --> 52:13.827
Right.

52:20.724 --> 52:22.275
[Dom] Hello, terminal to cusco?

52:24.655 --> 52:26.034
I really, really, need a way.

52:26.068 --> 52:28.862
- Really need a way.
- Really, really, really, need a way.

52:28.896 --> 52:32.344
Oh, fountains, all look grand.

52:32.379 --> 52:35.241
[Narrator] As dom and Lizzie
make an emergency pitstop.

52:35.275 --> 52:36.275
Thank you.

52:37.586 --> 52:40.896
Prius is the longest, I
have ever seen in my life.

52:40.931 --> 52:44.206
[Narrator continues] The other
three teams are closing in on puno.

52:44.241 --> 52:47.344
It feels good that this
bus has lost most of them.

52:47.379 --> 52:48.793
We're a long way.

52:48.827 --> 52:50.631
[Jamiul] Hopefully, we
just get to the checkpoint.

52:50.655 --> 52:52.620
Easy, breezy.

52:52.655 --> 52:57.000
[Narrator] High in the mountains
puno is situated on lake titicaca,

52:57.034 --> 53:02.551
formed over sixty million years ago,
when an earthquake struck the andes.

53:02.586 --> 53:06.551
[Dramatic music playing]

53:06.586 --> 53:09.965
Find me the end of the lake.

53:10.000 --> 53:11.758
- Honest.
- Your honest.

53:11.793 --> 53:13.620
It could be a case of anything,

53:16.068 --> 53:19.379
[dramatic music playing]

53:20.827 --> 53:21.827
Yeah, run me.

53:23.344 --> 53:24.493
I think Jen and Rob are here.

53:24.517 --> 53:26.103
- How'd you know?
- I had seen them.

53:34.551 --> 53:36.137
[Narrator] The
team's GPS trackers,

53:36.172 --> 53:39.344
notify them of the
exact checkpoint location

53:39.379 --> 53:43.931
across the bay at the far end of the extern,
you will see a large white square building.

53:43.965 --> 53:45.068
You see it over there.

53:45.103 --> 53:47.137
- What a big white building.
- Yeah.

53:47.172 --> 53:49.655
[Narrator] The hotel is on
the other side of the lake.

53:49.689 --> 53:51.793
The fastest route is by boat.

53:51.827 --> 53:53.758
We've been walking

53:53.793 --> 53:55.931
it's going to be
around here man.

53:55.965 --> 53:59.172
[Narrator] But after nightfall,
the only way is by taxi.

54:00.068 --> 54:02.724
India's casa.

54:03.862 --> 54:06.275
Oh some of them will, alright.

54:06.310 --> 54:08.482
I'm dying for this walk,
wanna join. So we don't fight.

54:08.517 --> 54:10.862
- No!
- No?

54:10.896 --> 54:13.068
[Car door closes]

54:13.103 --> 54:15.827
I think we could well
have overtaken a couple.

54:17.620 --> 54:19.310
Come on.

54:20.448 --> 54:21.448
Casa.

54:23.862 --> 54:25.448
- You sure?
- Yeah.

54:27.965 --> 54:30.517
[Dom laughing]

54:32.517 --> 54:34.758
These bags are
heavier and heavier,

54:34.793 --> 54:36.827
there's no paroon in altitude.

54:36.862 --> 54:39.275
Boys have over taken
us. The have gone.

54:39.310 --> 54:40.527
- What?
- They've just overtaken us.

54:40.551 --> 54:42.310
We're close.

54:42.344 --> 54:43.965
He's very close.

54:45.103 --> 54:46.724
Where did you boys come from?

54:47.551 --> 54:49.310
Out of the dark.

54:52.241 --> 54:53.965
- This is terrible.
- For whom?

54:57.172 --> 54:59.827
I don't think... I think
I'm going to pass out.

54:59.862 --> 55:01.413
He's not doing well.

55:01.448 --> 55:02.965
Just keep walking.

55:03.000 --> 55:04.931
[Jamiul coughing]

55:05.551 --> 55:07.931
[Emon] You alright?

55:07.965 --> 55:09.103
What are you, rood omen?

55:09.137 --> 55:10.862
[Jamiul grunting]

55:18.310 --> 55:19.310
Jax is here.

55:20.827 --> 55:24.344
Big square, white hotel.

55:24.862 --> 55:25.965
Okay, let's go.

55:26.000 --> 55:27.620
[Emon] You take dollars?

55:29.931 --> 55:32.689
Oh, got to be stupid enough.
Are you kidding me? Murder.

55:33.551 --> 55:35.862
[Unclear conversation]

55:39.068 --> 55:40.620
Stay behind the red taxi.

55:42.482 --> 55:44.310
They're right on our tail way.

55:44.344 --> 55:46.034
We don't know if we're
going the right way.

55:46.068 --> 55:48.586
Because we told him
to follow the taxi, so that,

55:48.620 --> 55:51.034
they know.

55:51.068 --> 55:53.655
[Laughing] What
they don't know...

55:54.793 --> 55:57.310
[Jen] It's just going to
be a mad dash at the end.

55:57.344 --> 55:59.137
- We're going.
- Get your bag.

56:01.172 --> 56:03.586
No frigging way. I
don't think I could run.

56:03.620 --> 56:06.655
- Come on, you can do it Robbie.
- I don't think, I can run.

56:06.689 --> 56:08.172
[Jamiul] What is this hill?

56:08.206 --> 56:09.206
Good wife.

56:09.655 --> 56:11.896
I need a satisfaction.

56:11.931 --> 56:15.103
I've to get in there.
Before them, I just need it.

56:15.137 --> 56:16.344
Lead the way.

56:16.379 --> 56:18.517
So we can dash ahead of you.

56:18.551 --> 56:19.551
Ok, go for it.

56:20.655 --> 56:22.793
[Jen] No, no, no.

56:25.448 --> 56:27.310
[Rob and Jen sighs]

56:28.137 --> 56:30.137
[Speaking foreign language]

56:37.172 --> 56:40.862
- Jo and Sam.
- Though that'd be us.

56:40.896 --> 56:42.448
- Second.
- Well done, pal.

56:43.310 --> 56:45.000
[Jen] Oh, my days.

56:46.344 --> 56:48.206
I'm really surprised
we came first.

56:48.241 --> 56:49.482
Yeah, us too.

56:49.517 --> 56:50.827
So I have to stand.

56:50.862 --> 56:52.482
Yeah.

56:52.517 --> 56:54.517
Everyone's okay? You alright?

56:54.551 --> 56:56.896
I think we've done well.
We are still sort of smiling.

56:57.448 --> 56:58.379
Still have energy.

56:58.413 --> 57:00.379
- I'm hungry.
- Yeah, he's hungry.

57:00.862 --> 57:02.413
Always hungry.

57:02.448 --> 57:06.655
And it just not us,
it you guys here.

57:06.689 --> 57:08.862
We didn't have come
first. We've lost our position.

57:08.896 --> 57:11.793
Its point four. I think
we can get back

57:11.827 --> 57:15.034
into the game. Very
proud that we did the mind.

57:15.068 --> 57:17.724
- Two very, very good experience.
- Experiences.

57:20.103 --> 57:22.413
I think we've been working
much better together.

57:22.448 --> 57:25.724
[Jen disappointedly]

57:25.758 --> 57:28.068
I think it's because I'm
enjoying myself more.

57:28.103 --> 57:29.631
- I think it is. Yeah.
- I just think it is.

57:29.655 --> 57:31.275
[Jen] I'm just a nicer person.

57:31.310 --> 57:35.344
Therefore, I'm easier to get on with
and communicate with that's true is true.

57:35.379 --> 57:36.793
I think so, yeah.

57:38.655 --> 57:41.137
My new mentality is enjoy
everything as it comes

57:41.172 --> 57:44.448
because it's a massive,
great big, incredible experience

57:44.482 --> 57:47.379
that I will never, ever
have ever get in my life.

57:47.413 --> 57:51.310
[Narrator] Three teams have checked
in with only ninety minutes between them

57:55.241 --> 57:57.206
but still out on the road.

57:57.241 --> 57:59.000
Liz is gone out all.

58:01.379 --> 58:05.724
I just never really thought,
I think, is the altitude.

58:05.758 --> 58:12.620
Everything says no, it's not the place
you want to be when you feel like this.

58:16.034 --> 58:19.482
- [Narrator] Next time.
- Cafayate to Argentina.

58:19.517 --> 58:21.862
[Narrator] Three new countries.

58:21.896 --> 58:23.493
[Rob] We're stronger
than you can ever imagine.

58:23.517 --> 58:24.655
[Narrator] Division

58:24.689 --> 58:26.137
I'm worried about the sound.

58:26.172 --> 58:27.206
Got no Google maps.

58:27.241 --> 58:28.620
Got no mom, got nothing.

58:28.655 --> 58:30.286
- [Narrator] Revelation.
- [Jamiul] Buy it.

58:30.310 --> 58:32.275
Is after when you left, if only.

58:32.310 --> 58:33.620
[Narrator] And calamity.

58:33.655 --> 58:35.034
