We robbed our boss, A1.

00:05.170 --> 00:06.890
Right now,
your tiny thimble of sperm

00:06.930 --> 00:10.290
is being mixed with my
underperforming eggs

00:10.330 --> 00:11.690
and we could be parents soon.

00:11.730 --> 00:14.570
Oh my God! They've fertilised
five eggs! That's incredible!

00:14.610 --> 00:16.210
So, Esme, how is the job hunt going?

00:16.250 --> 00:17.970
I was doing a bit of work for Jed.

00:18.010 --> 00:19.930
The stolen car game,
it's pretty solid.

00:19.970 --> 00:22.610
Now you need to hand your laptop in
straightaway!

00:22.650 --> 00:23.770

00:23.810 --> 00:25.850
It's gone.
That feels a bit suspicious.

00:25.890 --> 00:28.770
This has been escalated
to an official fraud investigation,

00:28.810 --> 00:31.610
so YOU shall be seeing
a lot more of ME.

00:31.650 --> 00:34.210
If that is Kethan,
you tell him to take that bag

00:34.250 --> 00:35.900
when he gets it, lube it up and -

00:37.010 --> 00:38.570
Come on!

00:45.690 --> 00:49.570

We're not teenagers
at Lookout Point.

00:56.090 --> 00:59.010
We're waiting for a blackmailer.

01:00.530 --> 01:03.050
I could keep asking the time
over and over again...

01:03.090 --> 01:05.130
OK, put something on.

(MESSAGE ALERT)Oh! Is that them?
No, it's the IVF clinic.

01:24.450 --> 01:27.130
They want us to come for our embryo
transfer tomorrow at five.

01:27.170 --> 01:30.570
Oh, my God. This time tomorrow
we could be pregnant.

01:30.610 --> 01:33.210
What if...
Oh, my God, what if two eggs take?

another robbery.

No, that's only Sally.
What the hell is she doing here?

01:42.370 --> 01:46.450
Why is she walking over to the car?
Why is she getting IN the car?

01:50.450 --> 01:52.530
Hello.
Hello, Sally. Very nice to see you,

01:52.570 --> 01:55.450
but we're actually waiting for
somebody, so -Oh, I know.

01:55.490 --> 01:58.930
What do you mean?
I know what you did.

02:00.530 --> 02:02.610
Holy shit, that was...

02:02.650 --> 02:03.970
This is the blackmailer?

02:04.010 --> 02:05.690
I love you,
but that's been really obvious

(THEME MUSIC)

02:14.930 --> 02:16.850
I knew something was going on

02:16.890 --> 02:20.130
cos Deacon had been flapping about
like a pelican on speed,

02:20.170 --> 02:23.410
pulling sickies, and you were
creeping round the office

02:23.450 --> 02:26.090
after hours,
so I checked the accounts.

02:26.130 --> 02:30.170
Sally... I've kept my head down at
that company for 20 years,

02:30.210 --> 02:34.210

makes me too look like Paw Patrol.

02:34.250 --> 02:37.410
All I ever wanted
was a quiet retirement.

Where are you thinking?
Somewhere on the South coast?

02:40.090 --> 02:42.170
Sliders Resort, Jamaica.

02:42.210 --> 02:47.010
Like Sandals, only more explicitly
erotic for the mature traveller.

Are you fucking a sci-fi movie?

No, he's my 26-year-old
Jamaican boyfriend.

02:56.210 --> 03:01.010
Tron says, why get tied up
in police red tape

03:01.050 --> 03:05.090
when I could be lying in the sun,
sipping Bacardi,

03:05.130 --> 03:07.970
while he works cocoa butter
into my stretch marks?

03:08.730 --> 03:11.090
So what do you want?
£50,000.

03:11.130 --> 03:14.850
50 grand, Sally? How much cocoa
butter does your arse need?

03:14.890 --> 03:18.130
I think 10% is a fair compromise
to avoid prison.

03:18.170 --> 03:21.850
10%? Well, we only took 50 grand,
you lunatic.

03:21.890 --> 03:24.690
Sally, you really are shit
at accounts, you know that?

03:24.730 --> 03:29.130
The Fairhaven account is missing
half a million pounds.

03:29.170 --> 03:32.130
What?
I was gonna tell you.

03:33.970 --> 03:38.090
What? You took half a million pounds
and you didn't think to tell me?

03:38.130 --> 03:41.250
I absolutely did want to tell you,
but I just couldn't find the time.

03:41.290 --> 03:43.730
Well, what about just now before
this greedy bitch got in the car?

03:43.770 --> 03:48.770
Can I assume from my end, though,
blackmail admin complete?

03:48.810 --> 03:52.410
Yes, Sally, you can go and tell
Transformer you've done your job.

03:55.530 --> 03:58.490
How could you lie about this?
Who even are you? 500 grand?

03:58.530 --> 04:01.970
I did it for us. You had the nerve
to tell me I couldn't buy a handbag

04:02.010 --> 04:03.810
because it would arouse attention!

04:03.850 --> 04:06.010
Do you know what arouses attention
more than a handbag?

04:06.050 --> 04:09.450
Half a million pounds. That's a big
arousal, Deacon, full hard-on.

04:09.490 --> 04:12.690
I know, but I opened up the account,
there was so much money in there.

04:12.730 --> 04:14.170
He said he couldn't pay our bonuses

04:14.210 --> 04:16.890
and then I look
and there's over a million quid.

04:16.930 --> 04:18.410
It just felt like the right thing.

04:18.450 --> 04:20.970
I hope it still feels like the right
thing in the prison showers.

04:21.010 --> 04:23.810
Look, Allison...
Who's going to prison?

04:23.850 --> 04:26.690
Jesus! Jesus Christ!

04:26.730 --> 04:30.690
Esme, what the fuck? Relax!
We're doing some work for Big Dom.

04:30.730 --> 04:32.730
You're taking serial numbers
off car parts.

04:32.770 --> 04:35.210
Honestly, it's barely illegal.

04:35.250 --> 04:38.410
Oh, good1 Please explain to me
how this is not illegal!

04:38.450 --> 04:42.890
Well, BD runs a chop shop, so
people take in boosted sports cars

04:42.930 --> 04:44.890
and then we do a few modifications

04:44.930 --> 04:47.370
and he smuggles them out of
the country in some big transporter.

04:47.410 --> 04:50.610
He's like a smaller version of
the WeBuyAnyCar guy. You know him?

04:52.730 --> 04:54.890
Esme, when I suggested you move away
from Only Fans,

04:54.930 --> 04:58.930
I stupidly hoped you'd try
something, I don't know, legal.

04:58.970 --> 05:00.930
Look,
we are talking high-end sports cars.

05:00.970 --> 05:02.770
Do you know the sort of people
who drive those?

05:02.810 --> 05:05.490
Rich old white dudes. 1%.

05:05.530 --> 05:08.330
Victimless crime. No, it's not.
You just don't like the victims.

05:08.370 --> 05:13.570

we're basically Robin Hood, baby.

05:13.610 --> 05:15.250
My baby.
Yeah! (LAUGHS)

05:15.290 --> 05:18.170
Esme, I'm worried.
What? That I'll turn out like you?

(SCOFFS)

05:20.810 --> 05:23.370
Fine, fuck your life up.

05:23.410 --> 05:25.010
I fucking will. Fuck!

05:25.050 --> 05:26.770
Can I just ask,
is Big Dom called Big Dom

05:26.810 --> 05:30.210
cos he's objectively big,
or is there a smaller Dom?

05:33.930 --> 05:35.770
Did you talk to Kethan
about the Sally thing?

05:35.810 --> 05:38.450
There's no problem with us
getting the money, is there?

05:38.490 --> 05:41.570
I hope not, although he did ask me
to meet him at his golf club.

05:41.610 --> 05:43.290
Why can't he just transfer
the money again?

05:43.330 --> 05:46.210
I think he just wants to show off
his fancy club, invite me to brunch,

05:46.250 --> 05:48.730
although he called it "luckfast"
cos he's a prick.

05:48.770 --> 05:51.530
Call in sick for me too.
I'm coming to luckfast.

05:51.570 --> 05:53.170
Why? Don't you trust me?
I do,

05:53.210 --> 05:57.490
I just don't wanna find out a week
from now it's a million pounds
or something.

05:57.530 --> 06:00.210
I'm not angry, I'm just...
Disappointed. I get it.

06:00.250 --> 06:03.090
Which is actually worse.
We'll work it out.

06:03.130 --> 06:05.090
I just wish you hadn't lied.

06:06.210 --> 06:07.490
Yeah, I know.

06:07.530 --> 06:10.090
Now I have to eat pineapple cores
cos the IVF form says

06:10.130 --> 06:13.650
they're anti-inflammatory
and good for the embryo transfer.

06:13.690 --> 06:16.410
I am a selfless hero,
making concessions,

06:16.450 --> 06:18.930
sacrificing my body,
soon to be a sacred vessel.

06:18.970 --> 06:20.610
What did you do?
Ejaculate once, yeah.

06:20.650 --> 06:23.090
By the way,
don't eat too many pineapples

06:23.130 --> 06:25.170
because I read somewhere that
pineapple eats you

06:25.210 --> 06:27.650
when you're eating it, like there's
some sort of molecule in it

06:27.690 --> 06:30.490
that dissolves you, so... What
the fuck are you going on about?

06:30.530 --> 06:31.570
Oh, nothing.

06:31.610 --> 06:34.410
Alfie, Allison and I have had
a bit of a relapse healthwise,

06:34.450 --> 06:36.300
so we're not gonna be coming in
today.

06:38.370 --> 06:39.770
NO!

06:39.810 --> 06:42.490
Alfie, you can't say no,
we've got serious stomach problems.

06:42.530 --> 06:46.610
I don't care if your arse
is spewing liquid magma,

06:46.650 --> 06:49.370
you're gonna be in that board room
at 4pm.

06:49.410 --> 06:51.490
You're my back-up, yeah?

06:51.530 --> 06:54.450
And anything I tell 'em, be my bez

06:54.490 --> 06:56.250
and shake
your little support maracas,

06:56.290 --> 06:59.970
because it's YOU missing
YOUR interview

07:00.010 --> 07:04.690
that has turned this
into a fraud investigation.

07:04.730 --> 07:07.370
Sorry, Alfie, did you say
fraud investigation?

07:07.410 --> 07:10.010
Alfie? Alfie?

07:17.530 --> 07:20.690
Why do we have to meet here?
Everyone looks like ET.

07:20.730 --> 07:23.970
I feel most comfortable
around the least wanted.

07:24.010 --> 07:25.850
Being a brown in a golf club
like this,

07:25.890 --> 07:28.810
it makes me feel like a UNICORN!

07:28.850 --> 07:31.770
(CHUCKLES) What the bloody hell
are YOU looking at?

07:31.810 --> 07:34.130
Nothing. Are the brown men in your
golf club being too loud?

07:34.170 --> 07:38.130
Oh, I do apologise, we will try
to talk quietly for the white man.

07:38.170 --> 07:39.730
That's not what I was -
Turn around.

07:39.770 --> 07:42.370
Beautiful brown unicorns
are talking!

07:44.850 --> 07:47.050
Look, all we have to do is
give Sally the cash

07:47.090 --> 07:50.010
and she will disappear, OK? We're not
talking about a hardened criminal.

07:50.050 --> 07:52.930
We're talking about
a sex-starved old lady.

07:52.970 --> 07:55.370
Yeah, Kethan,
all we're asking for is our money.

07:55.410 --> 07:59.370
And I keep telling you, the money
is in the system getting cleaned.

07:59.410 --> 08:00.450
That takes time.

08:00.490 --> 08:02.370
If you wanted instant access
to your funds,

08:02.410 --> 08:04.170
you should have met with Barclays,
innit?

08:04.210 --> 08:07.290
Well. maybe you could just give us -
Ooh, no, no, no.

08:07.330 --> 08:10.490
Do not ask me for a loan. Hm?
I'm already doing you a favour.

08:10.530 --> 08:13.970
You don't ask someone who is doing
you a favour for another favour.

08:14.010 --> 08:16.090
That's disgusting.
Uncle, please...

08:16.130 --> 08:18.210
Don't "please" me,
you fucking idiot.

08:19.530 --> 08:21.050
What do you think is gonna happen

08:21.090 --> 08:22.890
when this Sally has shagged
all the money away?

08:22.930 --> 08:26.050
You think she's gonna go, "Oh,
that was fun while it lasted"?

08:26.090 --> 08:32.090
Or do you think she's gonna say,
"Mm, why don't I make another
withdrawal from the twat bank?"?

08:32.130 --> 08:34.210
Hm? (BURPS)

08:35.330 --> 08:38.050
If this Sally is offering you
ultimatums,

08:39.050 --> 08:41.770
you have to deal with her.

08:41.810 --> 08:47.210
Or I will.
Sorry, do you mean...(MIMICS SOUND)?

08:47.250 --> 08:51.410
This isn't Goodfellas, you penis.
But yeah.

08:51.450 --> 08:55.450
Your choice. Either you do it
or I do, but much worse.

08:55.490 --> 09:00.050
Oh, and there will be a horrible
mess. Now, off you fuck.

09:00.090 --> 09:02.290
But uncle, we - Off you fuck.

09:04.010 --> 09:05.170
(SIGHS)

09:05.210 --> 09:07.690
Maybe we don't have to kill Sally if
we can pay her off some other way

09:07.730 --> 09:09.930
and get her out of the country
before Kethan gets to her,

09:09.970 --> 09:12.570
cos that's what she wants. Yes,
because that's what we've learned,

09:12.610 --> 09:14.410
that stealing 50 grand
has few consequences.

09:14.450 --> 09:17.250
Er, 500 grand. Oh, watch out.

09:17.290 --> 09:20.570
(COOL MUSIC PLAYING)

09:22.170 --> 09:24.370
Take care of it, will you?

09:27.530 --> 09:30.130
I can't believe
that prick thinks I'm a valet.

09:32.890 --> 09:35.490
Maybe you are.
What do you mean?

09:35.530 --> 09:37.130
Robin Hood, baby.

09:37.170 --> 09:39.210
You're not suggesting
we steal this car?

09:39.250 --> 09:43.650
Deacon, that prick assumed you were
the valet and gave you his keys.

09:43.690 --> 09:46.490
Not only would you be helping us
out, you'd be teaching him a lesson.

09:46.530 --> 09:47.530
Right, and what is that lesson?

09:47.570 --> 09:49.650
If you give a brown man your keys,
he'll steal you car?

09:49.690 --> 09:52.010
You said
"How am are we gonna get 50 grand?"

09:52.050 --> 09:54.650
And then a racist gave you
a Ferrari. It's like fate.

09:54.690 --> 09:57.970
So that's a viable defence in court,
is it? Look, Mr Half a Mil,

09:58.010 --> 10:01.170
I don't know if you spotted it,
but we are in a tricky situation
right now,

10:01.210 --> 10:04.010
where we either have to wait for
Kethan to kill Sally,

10:04.050 --> 10:05.570
or do it ourselves.

10:05.610 --> 10:08.410
So I don't know which one of
those options you fancy.

10:08.450 --> 10:11.410
Firing squad? Guillotine?

10:11.450 --> 10:15.210
OK... Let's steal this car.

10:16.050 --> 10:17.770
(ENGINE ROARS)

10:19.810 --> 10:21.290
(REVS)

10:27.850 --> 10:31.090
Babe! Yeah?
You're going like 8mph.

10:31.130 --> 10:34.090
There's no point in trying to sell
a damaged car, is there?

10:34.970 --> 10:39.250
I did not think the main emotion
I had after stealing a car
would be embarrassment.

10:43.810 --> 10:46.250
What's that bloody valet
doing with my car?

10:46.290 --> 10:48.530
He's nicking my car!

10:48.570 --> 10:51.890
Hey!
Oh shit. Look. What? What?

10:51.930 --> 10:53.490
Deacon, Deacon, put your foot down!
OK.

10:53.530 --> 10:55.210
(ENGINE STALLS)
Huh!

10:55.250 --> 10:57.570
Now you've stalled it.
Get out, I'll drive.

10:57.610 --> 10:59.250
It's actually a difficult car
to drive,

10:59.290 --> 11:02.330
just so you know. You fucking touch
my car and I'll kill you!

Go, go! We should just swap!

11:19.850 --> 11:22.090
I cannot believe you let me drive
knowing you could do this.

11:22.130 --> 11:24.610
They're coming.
Shit, they are catching us up.

11:24.650 --> 11:27.490
Get my fucking car, pull over!

11:27.530 --> 11:29.530
They're catching up,
they're catching us up!

11:29.570 --> 11:32.490
Go, go, go, go!
What the hell are we gonna do?

11:32.530 --> 11:35.570
This is the worst possible day
to not be wearing deodorant.

11:35.610 --> 11:37.770
I've got an idea.
I'm indicating right. What?

11:37.810 --> 11:39.130
Take the next left!

11:40.410 --> 11:43.250
We've gone the wrong fucking way.
That way, you twat!

11:43.290 --> 11:48.610
Whoo, nice one. Pull over!
My fucking wheels are wrecked.

11:48.650 --> 11:51.010
You're fucking dead!
They're catching us up!

11:51.050 --> 11:55.370
Fucking hell, girl1 Drive, drive!
I'm gonna fucking rip your head off.

11:55.410 --> 11:57.770
Get over! Drive!

11:57.810 --> 12:01.370
Do you reckon we'll fit under there?
I'm going for it.

12:06.610 --> 12:07.930
No! Look out! Fuck!

12:14.490 --> 12:15.770
That was so fucking cool!

12:19.050 --> 12:21.690
OK, go, go, go!
(TYRES SCREECH)

12:26.690 --> 12:28.410
OK, I think we managed to lose them.
Yeah.

12:28.450 --> 12:31.490
We better get a move on if we're
gonna get Sally's money from Big Dom

12:31.530 --> 12:34.170
and be at the clinic by five.
Yeah.

12:34.210 --> 12:35.810
Shit!
What?

12:35.850 --> 12:38.250
I promised Alfie I'd be at the
office for four for a meeting.

12:38.290 --> 12:40.690
Why?
Because you told me to act normal.

12:40.730 --> 12:42.570
He said he didn't care
if my arse was spewing lava.

12:42.610 --> 12:45.930
OK, you sell the car, I can get out
and walk to the office from here

12:45.970 --> 12:48.650
and do the Alfie meeting, then
we'll meet at the clinic at five.

12:48.690 --> 12:51.450
But isn't it gonna look mental,
you turning up to a meeting
instead of me?

12:51.490 --> 12:54.690
You'd be better selling the car than
acting normal with Alfie.OK.

12:54.730 --> 12:57.850
Don't let them walk all over you. In
this game, it's all about respect.

12:57.890 --> 12:59.530
Yeah, it's the way
you carry yourself,

12:59.570 --> 13:03.810
you're just confident, like you
belong in that world, that...

You know that Big Dom guy
that deals in those cars,

13:14.250 --> 13:15.490
does he have a phone number?
Why?

13:15.530 --> 13:18.250
I need it for a friend.
What friend?

13:18.290 --> 13:20.090
It's just a mate who's looking for
some work.

13:20.130 --> 13:23.050
Your mate isn't gonna be able
to just phone him up

13:23.090 --> 13:25.010
and ask him for a job!

13:25.050 --> 13:26.810
This isn't as quick as I hoped
it would be, Esme.

13:26.850 --> 13:29.450
Tell me the real reason you need it
and I'll give it to you.Fine.

13:29.490 --> 13:31.970
I stole a Ferrari
and I wanna sell it to him.

13:32.010 --> 13:35.090
OK, Deacon,
if you don't wanna say, whatever.

13:35.130 --> 13:36.410
I'll text it to you.
Thank you.

13:36.450 --> 13:38.810

Are you Big Dom?
Yes, mate, that's me. This is Dom.

14:12.530 --> 14:16.610
I knew there'd be a normal-size one!
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Back that up.

14:16.650 --> 14:19.610
Are you saying I'm not normal?
What, I'm abnormal?

14:19.650 --> 14:21.410
I'm a freak, am I? No.
How dare you.

14:21.450 --> 14:23.650
No, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to say
you were abnormal,

14:23.690 --> 14:25.490
that wasn't what -
So, I'm the abnormal one?

14:25.530 --> 14:27.930
Look, no. I wasn't saying -
I can take that kinda japer,

14:27.970 --> 14:29.810
I can take it
cos I've got broad shoulders.

14:29.850 --> 14:32.370
I'm used to it.
But this one, this little lamb...

14:32.410 --> 14:35.050
Are you all right?
I'm... I'm sorry...

14:35.090 --> 14:37.690

You gonna let that go?

14:37.730 --> 14:40.490
Look, I'm really sorry. Is it
possible just to start again, please?

14:40.530 --> 14:43.010
Do you wanna punch him in the face?
No.

Where's Deacon?

14:49.890 --> 14:55.250
Oh, he is so, so sick.
He's like a chemical weapon.

14:55.290 --> 14:59.210
But he was desperate that one of us
should be here. I've had it bad too.

14:59.250 --> 15:02.290
It has just been flying out of me.

15:02.330 --> 15:04.650
No, no, we didn't come in here
to listen stories of women

15:04.690 --> 15:08.810
shitting themselves.
Apologies, this is Deacon's wife.

15:08.850 --> 15:11.730
It might be nice if you tell
Mr Harris from the SFO here

15:11.770 --> 15:16.650
every single thing he wants to know.
How may I help you?

15:16.690 --> 15:18.890
How does she smell, mate?
Give her a good sniff.

15:18.930 --> 15:20.330
(SNIFFS)
Is that a real Ferrari?

15:20.370 --> 15:22.010
Yeah, it's good gear.
Nice.

15:22.050 --> 15:23.530
So where did you pick
this beauty up?

15:23.570 --> 15:26.650
Took it off some dick at the golf
club down the road.

15:26.690 --> 15:29.290
Really? Really?
Yeah, why?

15:29.330 --> 15:31.130
Well, we've just met you
for the first time

15:31.170 --> 15:33.570
and you're coming in here giving it
the old Billy Big Bollocks

15:33.610 --> 15:35.490
about the crime
you've just committed.

15:35.530 --> 15:40.170
Is this your first time doing this?
No. I flip cars over all the time.

15:41.250 --> 15:43.490
You're a liar, mate.

15:43.530 --> 15:46.890
It's really quite simple. There are
accounts on your husband's laptop

15:46.930 --> 15:49.210
that have become essential
to our case.

15:49.250 --> 15:52.130
We have no other option but to
report your husband to the police

15:52.170 --> 15:53.850
for obstruction of justice.

15:53.890 --> 15:57.450
We work
within a very small community.

15:57.490 --> 15:59.090
Never heard of you, though.

15:59.130 --> 16:02.530
So I'm saying that
you are a bullshitter, pal.

16:02.570 --> 16:04.250
I think you may have just
popped your cherry.

16:04.290 --> 16:06.930
What? No. Absolutely not.

16:06.970 --> 16:09.610
You don't wanna fuck with me,
all right? Oh, I think we do.

16:09.650 --> 16:13.210
See, the thing we're gonna do most
today is fuck with you.

16:13.250 --> 16:14.530
Please don't do that.

16:14.570 --> 16:18.370
It's three, four hours of just
constant fucking with you,

16:18.410 --> 16:21.810
and if at the end of that, I go,
"I don't think he's been fucked with
enough,"

16:21.850 --> 16:24.410
I'll say "Everyone stay,
a little overtime,

16:24.450 --> 16:26.730
cos we're gonna fuck with him
a little bit more."

16:26.770 --> 16:29.330
What I'm telling you, pal,
this is a fuckfest coming.

16:29.370 --> 16:31.970
We'll keep on fucking with you
until we say the fucking -

16:32.010 --> 16:34.450
(SCREAMS)
Whoa whoa!

16:34.490 --> 16:37.410
Hang on, mate.
Whoa whoa. Enough!

16:37.450 --> 16:39.330
My husband is an incredibly
honest man.

16:39.370 --> 16:42.610
I am having a really fucking
stressful time right now.

16:42.650 --> 16:45.250
He is the most hardworking
and principled man

16:45.290 --> 16:46.490
you could ever hope to meet.

16:46.530 --> 16:50.090
My uncle has taken all my money
and he keeps trying to fuck my mum.

16:50.130 --> 16:53.610
He would be heartbroken to think
he had come anywhere near
any criminal activity.

16:53.650 --> 16:56.530
I'm being blackmailed!
He hasn't even had
a speeding ticket.

16:56.570 --> 16:58.090
I've just been in a car chase.

16:58.130 --> 17:00.850
He will do his utmost to make sure
this is sorted out.

17:00.890 --> 17:03.730
My wife's about to get inseminated
and I've got to make it
to the clinic by 5pm

17:03.770 --> 17:06.250
just to make sure I can see
the doctor stick it in her.

17:06.290 --> 17:08.610
That's one of the main reasons
I fell in love with him.

17:08.650 --> 17:12.250
So this is enough!
Please don't punish a good man

17:12.290 --> 17:13.890
for bad luck and bad timing.

17:13.930 --> 17:15.970
You're gonna give me 50 grand
for this car

17:16.010 --> 17:19.130
or I'm gonna smash the fuck
out of this fucking place!

17:19.170 --> 17:22.090

17:22.130 --> 17:23.850

Are you finished?

17:23.890 --> 17:26.290
Yeah, I think I am, yeah.

17:26.330 --> 17:30.450
Thank you for that explanation,
Mrs Mendez We will pass that on.

17:30.490 --> 17:33.730
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you so much, your honours.

17:33.770 --> 17:36.890
There was no need for that at all,
really, mate.

17:36.930 --> 17:38.650
That was uncalled for.

17:38.690 --> 17:40.650
We was just trying to have a little
bit of fun with you.

17:40.690 --> 17:43.250
Give you, like,
an authentic criminal experience.

17:43.290 --> 17:45.090
We'll give you your 50 grand.

17:45.130 --> 17:48.370
So you know,
this is actually worth 70 minimum,

17:48.410 --> 17:52.770
so you've made an absolute fanny
out of yourself, so...

17:53.570 --> 17:56.010
Would it be possible to get 70?
Fuck off.

17:56.050 --> 17:58.000
Absolutely.
Be on your way. Run, please.

17:58.490 --> 18:01.610
Run as fast as you can,
and don't look back.

I reckon with the right bikini...

Shut up, Sally, OK?

18:17.850 --> 18:19.530
Listen to me, Beanie Man,
here's your money

18:19.570 --> 18:21.370
but you have to promise
to leave straightsway.

18:21.410 --> 18:23.730

drinks on Thursday...

18:23.770 --> 18:25.930
No. no. Tonight, OK?

18:25.970 --> 18:28.210
You take this money and it's over
and you never come back.

18:28.250 --> 18:30.890
We have told the man
who is laundering the money

18:30.930 --> 18:33.290
that we stole,
that you blackmailed us

18:33.330 --> 18:35.850
and he made it pretty clear
that he wanted to kill you.

18:35.890 --> 18:38.050
Kill me?
Yes.

18:38.090 --> 18:40.330
And just to be, you know,
completely transparent,

18:40.370 --> 18:42.490
I am planning on telling him
that WE killed you, OK?

18:42.530 --> 18:44.610

fucking embarrassing.

18:44.650 --> 18:46.130

Well, OK.

18:46.170 --> 18:47.970
So here's the money. I have to go.

18:48.810 --> 18:50.410

and, you know,

18:50.450 --> 18:53.930
despite the blackmail thing and this
hideous cultural appropriation,

18:53.970 --> 18:56.770

in that meeting, I was on fire.

you were, how kind.

Is she out pickpocketing with Jed?

I don't know.
I'm gonna leave her to it for a bit.

till proven otherwise.

to get ahead of ourselves,

Yeah.

Sally out for you, innit?

No, you're not, actually,
because I was about to call you

20:31.250 --> 20:32.850
to let you know that
we took care of her.

20:32.890 --> 20:34.810
Deacon,
if you're lying to me right now,

20:34.850 --> 20:37.490
you know what I'm gonna do to you,
innit? Let me tell you something.

20:37.530 --> 20:41.170
I'm not lying because we took care
of her, properly took care of her.

20:41.210 --> 20:42.930
Her and her boyfriend.

20:42.970 --> 20:45.530
Killing the boyfriend is
a bit of a dick move, innit?

the obstruction of justice

in a criminal investigation.

when questioned
