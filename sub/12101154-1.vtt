WEBVTT

00:20.344 --> 00:22.413
Knox posting up
with a mismatch on Rozier.

00:22.446 --> 00:24.182
Knox turns,
backs him up,

00:24.214 --> 00:25.649
puts up a 10-foot floater.

00:25.682 --> 00:27.451
Rejected by Horford.

00:27.484 --> 00:28.819
Rebound goes
to DeAndre Jordan

00:28.852 --> 00:30.288
and back out
to Dennis Smith, Jr.,

00:30.321 --> 00:31.289
who will start over.

00:31.321 --> 00:32.390
Now Smith penetrates.

00:32.423 --> 00:34.192
Spins and loses it
out of bounds

00:34.225 --> 00:36.727
after passing it directly
to the Celtics' bench.

00:36.759 --> 00:38.862
Another Knick turnover.

00:38.896 --> 00:40.865
Hayward inbounds
and Rozier will bring it up.

00:40.898 --> 00:43.768
Boston with a 21-point lead
three minutes from the half,

00:43.801 --> 00:45.870
and the Knicks
now deep in the hole.

00:45.902 --> 00:48.506
Rozier to Jaylen Brown,
baseline for three.

00:48.539 --> 00:50.841
Yes! And the Knicks down 24.

00:50.874 --> 00:53.678
And here come the boos
from the crowd here

00:53.710 --> 00:55.213
in Madison Square Garden.

03:40.144 --> 03:42.612
Zama, you're late.

03:43.980 --> 03:46.917
- Where were you?
- Fati's house.

03:46.949 --> 03:49.986
Mm, we called Fati,
we know you weren't there.

03:51.187 --> 03:52.455
I...

03:52.489 --> 03:53.957
Whatever, you know what?
I was dancing.

03:53.991 --> 03:55.126
You don't have
to be so strict.

03:55.158 --> 03:58.495
No, this is hardly strict.

03:58.528 --> 04:01.097
- Yeah, it is.
- No, it isn't!

04:01.131 --> 04:02.766
Look at you.

04:02.800 --> 04:04.034
Every day
it's something different.

04:04.067 --> 04:04.835
We're just...
we're worried.

04:04.867 --> 04:06.436
Is it so bad
that we want to know

04:06.469 --> 04:08.104
that you're safe?

04:08.138 --> 04:09.140
This is a big city.

04:09.173 --> 04:10.408
Yeah, I know,
I grew up here.

04:10.441 --> 04:11.474
Hey.

04:11.508 --> 04:12.643
You tone it down.

04:12.675 --> 04:14.811
No.

04:14.844 --> 04:17.981
Zama, you have every right
to be sad still.

04:18.014 --> 04:19.082
- You just can't...
- Can't what?

04:19.115 --> 04:20.950
- Can't what?
- You cannot treat

04:20.983 --> 04:22.952
your uncle and I
like this.

04:22.985 --> 04:25.889
Then leave me alone.

04:25.923 --> 04:27.557
This isn't just about you.

04:29.860 --> 04:31.095
I hate you.

04:31.127 --> 04:33.029
Don't say that.

04:34.130 --> 04:35.698
I hate you.

06:21.137 --> 06:22.038
...it would be okay,
but, you know,

06:22.072 --> 06:25.074
what would be better
if, like, we had a plan.

06:25.108 --> 06:25.908
- On the boardwalk.
- Huh?

06:25.942 --> 06:27.845
We'll sleep
under the boardwalk.

06:27.877 --> 06:29.312
Oh no.

06:36.252 --> 06:37.721
Hm.

06:37.754 --> 06:39.790
What are you saving
this crap for?

06:41.692 --> 06:44.762
It's a stack
of filthy magazines.

06:45.661 --> 06:47.031
Rare Parts is not filth.

06:47.064 --> 06:50.100
It's political commentary.

06:50.132 --> 06:51.968
We gotta start fresh.

06:52.002 --> 06:53.037
Getting kicked out
of your house

06:53.069 --> 06:57.206
is not a fresh start,
it's a death sentence.

06:57.240 --> 06:58.776
Son of a bitch.

06:58.809 --> 07:00.344
Oh, now you're swearing.

07:00.377 --> 07:02.112
What's with the swearing?

07:02.144 --> 07:05.115
I swear because I'm angry, okay?

07:09.386 --> 07:12.023
I don't want
to leave this place.

07:14.091 --> 07:15.259
I know, Benji.

07:17.394 --> 07:19.764
I want that man dead.

07:21.365 --> 07:24.168
Kicking us
out of our home

07:24.201 --> 07:27.004
to build
a parking lot?

07:27.036 --> 07:29.706
I used to think there's
two people that were evil.

07:29.740 --> 07:33.811
Hitler and that bully
that beat up on Saul

07:33.843 --> 07:35.778
- in P.S. 205...
- Rick?

07:35.812 --> 07:37.114
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

08:46.283 --> 08:48.418
Hey, what you doin', Saul?

08:48.451 --> 08:49.919
Nothin'.

08:51.822 --> 08:53.322
Who was that girl I saw you with
the other night?

08:55.091 --> 08:56.156
Hm?

08:57.159 --> 08:58.294
Oh, wait, wait, my bad.

08:58.327 --> 09:00.463
That was somebody else.

09:00.496 --> 09:02.399
Hey, come to think about it.

09:02.432 --> 09:04.935
I don't think I've ever
seen you with a girl.

09:04.967 --> 09:07.303
Why is that?

09:07.336 --> 09:09.206
I don't know.

09:09.239 --> 09:10.340
I mean,
why haven't I seen you

09:10.373 --> 09:14.211
with a girl, guy,
anybody, huh?

12:59.134 --> 13:02.972
...will step to the line
averaging 71% from the stripe.

13:03.005 --> 13:04.341
He makes the first.

13:08.077 --> 13:10.212
His 13 rebounds
are a testimony of that,

13:10.245 --> 13:13.951
as he makes the second,
and the Knicks will inbound.

13:13.984 --> 13:15.352
Smith motions for a screen,

13:15.384 --> 13:17.120
changes his mind
and lays it off to Dotson

13:17.153 --> 13:18.688
who's guarded closely
by Simmons.

13:18.721 --> 13:21.091
Dotson looking
for Jordan inside. Delivers.

13:21.124 --> 13:23.093
Jordan now turns on Embiid,
drives.

13:24.124 --> 13:24.160
Rejected!

13:24.193 --> 13:25.094
The ball
winding up

13:25.129 --> 13:28.130
five rows past
a bewildered Knicks bench.

13:28.163 --> 13:29.598
Embiid lowering the boom

13:29.631 --> 13:32.936
on top of the New York gloom.

13:39.009 --> 13:40.610
Stop with this
or I'll have to call the police.

13:40.643 --> 13:42.178
No, you won't.

13:43.679 --> 13:45.381
What do you want?

13:46.783 --> 13:48.552
Uh, you know.

13:51.287 --> 13:52.556
Talk to him.

13:52.589 --> 13:54.959
He's gone out
for the night.

14:04.801 --> 14:07.537
He's gonna pay.

14:07.570 --> 14:09.006
What?

14:10.440 --> 14:12.576
You know that, right?

14:12.609 --> 14:13.777
Stop calling here.

14:15.144 --> 14:17.313
You're all gonna pay.

15:25.181 --> 15:26.182
Thank you very much.

15:26.216 --> 15:28.317
Sure.

15:28.350 --> 15:30.486
As someone
who's been fortunate enough

15:30.519 --> 15:35.258
to partner with him
on a number of projects,

15:35.291 --> 15:38.628
and to those of you
about to dip your toes

15:38.660 --> 15:43.766
in the water on this one,
a toast.

15:54.409 --> 15:55.545
So...

15:57.714 --> 16:00.818
What do you say to a man
who has made you rich?

16:04.386 --> 16:06.823
Let me amend
that question.

16:09.292 --> 16:12.863
What do you say a man
who's made you filthy rich?

16:14.797 --> 16:17.399
And, gentlemen,
I'm not talking about

16:17.432 --> 16:22.538
a slip at the Orient Point
Yacht Club rich.

16:22.572 --> 16:25.142
I'm not talking about
sending your three daughters

16:25.174 --> 16:27.843
to Spence rich.

16:27.876 --> 16:31.480
I'm not even talking
about paying cash

16:31.514 --> 16:33.850
for your Aspen house rich.

16:33.883 --> 16:34.852
No.

16:36.852 --> 16:39.522
I'm talking about
something different.

16:41.658 --> 16:43.860
I'm talking about
something more.

16:46.495 --> 16:49.231
I'm talking about

16:49.264 --> 16:54.337
arranging the skyline
in your image rich.

16:55.938 --> 16:58.507
I'm talking about
stamping your name

16:58.541 --> 17:01.812
on the public's forehead rich.

17:03.379 --> 17:06.549
And like his father
before him,

17:06.583 --> 17:09.553
I'm talking about
legend rich.

17:10.385 --> 17:12.923
Sultan rich.

17:14.324 --> 17:16.593
King rich.

17:19.695 --> 17:20.663
So...

17:22.498 --> 17:24.835
What do you say to him?

17:26.736 --> 17:28.739
I'll tell you
what you say.

17:36.546 --> 17:41.317
You get down on one knee
and you raise your glass.

17:46.588 --> 17:48.357
To you, sir...

17:50.727 --> 17:52.796
...I say thank you.

17:54.730 --> 17:56.232
Thank you.

18:25.560 --> 18:26.895
Go home, Saul.

18:30.400 --> 18:32.669
I told you,
no double shift tonight.

18:36.471 --> 18:38.508
You got your money, right?

18:40.876 --> 18:43.012
Go spend it on a lady.

18:43.046 --> 18:44.948
Buy some weed.

18:44.980 --> 18:47.416
Do whatever it is you do.

19:07.336 --> 19:09.038
Yo, I fuckin' see you.

19:33.730 --> 19:34.698
Thank you.

19:34.730 --> 19:36.566
It's all good, Danny.

19:55.084 --> 19:56.419
Thank you.

21:44.026 --> 21:46.162
Do you live
with your parents?

21:46.194 --> 21:48.030
No, my uncle and aunt.

21:49.164 --> 21:50.733
You like them?

22:12.989 --> 22:14.891
What happened
to your parents?

22:22.932 --> 22:24.099
Do you live
with your parents?

22:24.133 --> 22:26.236
No, grandparents.

22:33.241 --> 22:35.545
What's with the mask?

22:35.577 --> 22:37.047
I don't know.

22:44.653 --> 22:47.057
Maybe I'm like
a superhero or somethin'.

22:48.723 --> 22:49.859
Yeah?

22:51.961 --> 22:53.863
Maybe.

22:53.895 --> 22:55.231
I don't know.

24:53.816 --> 24:55.018
Thank you.

26:04.286 --> 26:06.122
You know her?

26:06.154 --> 26:09.224
No, just checking out her gear.

26:13.394 --> 26:16.231
There's a chocolate glaze
in there somewhere.

26:16.265 --> 26:17.900
- You want it?
- Mm-mm.

26:22.371 --> 26:24.907
That's my uncle.

26:30.311 --> 26:32.115
He a bad guy?

26:36.050 --> 26:37.452
Now, he doesn't...

26:37.486 --> 26:40.289
I thought, you know...

26:40.321 --> 26:42.424
Saw you, and I thought he'd...

26:42.458 --> 26:45.995
With the... he doesn't really have
any of... the stuff.

26:46.028 --> 26:49.499
Do you always...

26:49.531 --> 26:52.067
Do you always wear the...

26:52.101 --> 26:55.304
So what?
It's what I want to wear.

26:55.336 --> 26:56.839
Huh.

27:00.542 --> 27:02.377
You gonna go home?

27:02.411 --> 27:05.849
- I don't really want to deal.
- Deal with what?

27:11.420 --> 27:14.224
Then what, you know,
you wanna hang out more?

27:16.525 --> 27:17.994
Yeah.

27:22.096 --> 27:23.900
Do you wanna take a walk?

27:23.932 --> 27:25.167
Walk?

27:25.201 --> 27:27.103
Do you like to?

27:27.135 --> 27:28.570
Like to walk?

27:28.604 --> 27:30.006
Yeah.

27:30.038 --> 27:31.540
Sure.

29:02.163 --> 29:04.099
Wanna get a slice?

29:06.101 --> 29:08.337
Somebody will use 'em.

29:16.244 --> 29:17.946
Good?

29:20.615 --> 29:22.984
- Can you do a 360?
- What?

29:23.018 --> 29:26.255
Like a, you know,
a full spin.

29:26.288 --> 29:28.691
Yeah, probably.

29:28.723 --> 29:30.960
You wanna show me?
Come on.

29:33.295 --> 29:34.497
Almost.

29:34.529 --> 29:38.000
- It was really good though.
- You're turn.

29:38.032 --> 29:39.267
I can't do it.

29:39.300 --> 29:41.569
- What?
- No, I can't do it.

29:43.071 --> 29:44.139
Hey!

29:56.184 --> 29:59.221
- Thank you.
- No more thankin' me, okay?

29:59.253 --> 30:01.156
Okay.

30:30.251 --> 30:32.422
It's not funny.

30:43.664 --> 30:45.134
Sorry.

31:15.763 --> 31:18.800
This thing is getting gross.

32:47.388 --> 32:49.192
You all right?

32:52.894 --> 32:55.097
Is he breathing?

32:58.333 --> 33:01.370
- What?
- Booze.

33:01.403 --> 33:03.739
He's just... he's drunk.

33:04.539 --> 33:06.241
Do you drink?

33:06.275 --> 33:08.511
Not really. You?

33:08.544 --> 33:10.146
No.

33:14.549 --> 33:16.519
Should we call 9-1-1?

33:18.287 --> 33:20.588
We just let him sleep it off.

33:20.622 --> 33:22.557
What are you doing?

34:00.895 --> 34:02.230
Turn it off.

34:02.263 --> 34:04.266
- Hmm?
- Turn it off.

34:43.804 --> 34:45.573
Wanna go for a drive?

34:55.516 --> 34:56.551
What?

34:56.585 --> 34:59.021
I don't know how to drive.

39:40.201 --> 39:42.237
I'm starving.

39:51.612 --> 39:53.548
It smells.

40:12.032 --> 40:14.835
- Salam.
- Salam.

40:14.869 --> 40:16.905
Can I help you?

40:16.938 --> 40:18.574
Yeah, um,

40:18.606 --> 40:21.143
I'm looking for a new niqab,

40:21.175 --> 40:24.346
or maybe something
a little less...

40:24.378 --> 40:26.914
A little less?

40:26.947 --> 40:29.617
Ah, a little less.

40:29.650 --> 40:32.053
It's okay, sweetie,
I'm from Staten Island.

40:32.086 --> 40:35.690
Let's get you out of these
and get into something new.

40:35.724 --> 40:37.125
But I don't have niqabs.

40:37.157 --> 40:39.827
I have saris, abayas, kurtas,

40:39.860 --> 40:41.596
and so many colors.

40:41.630 --> 40:45.233
You would look really nice
in a bright color.

40:45.266 --> 40:48.604
How about... red?

40:58.380 --> 41:00.648
Hi.

41:00.681 --> 41:02.216
How are ya?

41:05.820 --> 41:08.256
You're a happy guy.
You wanna try on a mask?

41:08.289 --> 41:10.258
- Yes.
- Yeah?

41:10.291 --> 41:13.028
Want me to put it on you?

41:13.061 --> 41:14.763
Yeah?

41:19.967 --> 41:21.802
Can you see all right?

41:21.835 --> 41:23.804
Put it up a little for you.

41:23.838 --> 41:25.708
There you go.

41:30.378 --> 41:32.881
It looks great.

41:36.317 --> 41:39.086
Head is huge.

41:40.387 --> 41:44.058
We'll take it off.

41:44.092 --> 41:46.327
Do you like?

41:51.298 --> 41:54.835
It looks really... good,
you know?

41:54.869 --> 41:57.739
Thanks.

44:07.434 --> 44:10.237
Guy kneeling back there.

44:10.271 --> 44:12.374
Praying.

44:14.342 --> 44:16.010
Praying.

44:21.315 --> 44:23.050
Do you pray?

44:24.418 --> 44:26.054
Do you?

44:28.021 --> 44:30.090
No.

44:30.123 --> 44:31.826
Not really.

44:47.342 --> 44:50.177
Do you have a problem?

44:50.210 --> 44:51.545
No.

44:53.081 --> 44:56.617
It's just you remind me
of my youngest daughter.

44:58.987 --> 45:01.155
And how much I miss her.

46:19.333 --> 46:21.368
Davis fakes left,
spins, fadeaway.

46:21.402 --> 46:24.371
Oh, what a light touch
by Anthony Davis

46:24.405 --> 46:26.574
as he drains
yet another jumper.

46:26.606 --> 46:28.108
Nothing but net.

46:28.141 --> 46:30.110
So here come the Knicks
down by 16,

46:30.143 --> 46:31.679
searching for answers
in the desert, and...

49:24.518 --> 49:33.427
Hey.

51:26.306 --> 51:28.709
Look, just get the team away
from the Dolans

51:28.742 --> 51:31.578
and just build 'em back up
from scratch.

51:31.612 --> 51:34.682
Listen, nobody would disagree
with you in theory

51:34.715 --> 51:37.785
that the Dolan family has done
this historic franchise

51:37.818 --> 51:41.990
a disservice with their
particular management style.

51:42.023 --> 51:44.692
But here's a small fact,
they own the team.

51:44.724 --> 51:46.793
Yeah, well, so do the...
what's his name...

51:46.827 --> 51:48.763
the Clippers owner,
but DeSilver stepped in.

51:48.795 --> 51:50.897
- He did the right thing.
- Very different circumstances.

51:50.931 --> 51:52.766
- So what?
- So you're saying

51:52.800 --> 51:54.568
the NBA should take
legal action.

51:54.601 --> 51:57.971
Go to court to repossess
the Knicks from Dolan because...

51:58.005 --> 52:00.041
- 'Cause they suck!
- I love it.

52:00.074 --> 52:02.376
- Next caller.
- Yeah.

52:16.523 --> 52:18.460
Bring the paperwork.

52:33.039 --> 52:36.744
Find your money, mayor?

52:36.777 --> 52:37.778
- What the fuck?
- Get the fuck out

52:37.811 --> 52:39.980
of Coney Island, douchebag!

52:40.014 --> 52:41.349
- Nobody wants you here!
- Shit!

52:41.382 --> 52:43.918
Fuck, Jesus fucking Christ.

52:46.554 --> 52:47.889
Go!

54:05.766 --> 54:08.403
I'm actually kinda hungry again.

54:11.505 --> 54:13.907
Your appetite is insane,
you know that?

54:18.179 --> 54:21.014
You like pickles?

54:28.822 --> 54:30.757
Can I get a small thing
of butter?

54:30.791 --> 54:33.528
- Siberian butter?
- Okay.

54:33.561 --> 54:36.530
- Thank you.
- You're welcome

54:36.563 --> 54:37.798
Thank you.

55:34.855 --> 55:37.724
Wanna try a little
pickled watermelon?

55:37.757 --> 55:40.927
- Hmm.
- Really good.

55:40.960 --> 55:43.130
Mm, so sour.

55:45.632 --> 55:47.134
Sour's good.

57:56.963 --> 58:00.168
You know, I don't know 'em, but
they're probably worried sick.

58:03.070 --> 58:04.806
Probably.

58:09.677 --> 58:12.947
Something bad happened.

58:12.980 --> 58:14.648
What?

58:16.949 --> 58:20.053
My dad died, like a year ago.

1:00:16.068 --> 1:00:17.304
Thank you.

1:00:56.175 --> 1:00:58.144
This looks bad.

1:00:58.177 --> 1:01:01.281
You hardly look like a gangster.

1:01:01.315 --> 1:01:04.552
That's because
I'm not a gangster.

1:01:10.891 --> 1:01:12.893
Nice dinner the other night.

1:01:12.925 --> 1:01:13.759
You put on quite a show.

1:01:13.793 --> 1:01:18.031
Well, that was my job,
wasn't it?

1:01:18.065 --> 1:01:20.067
They wire you the money?

1:01:22.202 --> 1:01:24.038
You're welcome.

1:01:27.340 --> 1:01:29.409
This is the part where
you could say thank you.

1:01:29.443 --> 1:01:31.312
You owed me.

1:01:35.615 --> 1:01:38.418
And what's the deal with
this Brooklyn development?

1:01:38.452 --> 1:01:39.553
Everything looks good.

1:01:39.585 --> 1:01:41.054
Well, that's not what I hear.

1:01:41.088 --> 1:01:44.124
I hear you're behind.

1:01:44.157 --> 1:01:45.559
What can I do
to get you back in?

1:01:48.027 --> 1:01:50.496
No, after the bath
we took last time,

1:01:50.530 --> 1:01:51.498
it's too much money.

1:01:51.530 --> 1:01:54.067
It's just a bridge,
less than $40 million.

1:01:54.101 --> 1:01:55.402
No.

1:01:55.434 --> 1:01:57.203
No way.

1:01:57.237 --> 1:01:59.139
The bank's being watched
much closer now.

1:01:59.172 --> 1:02:00.307
I can talk to Bill.

1:02:00.340 --> 1:02:02.142
Yeah, Bill.

1:02:02.175 --> 1:02:03.577
Fucking useless.

1:02:03.610 --> 1:02:05.479
- Then I can sweeten it a little.
- No.

1:02:05.512 --> 1:02:08.515
Three units just for you.

1:02:08.547 --> 1:02:11.351
On a project downtown then.

1:02:11.385 --> 1:02:15.556
What is next, box seats
to Billy Joel at the Garden?

1:02:15.588 --> 1:02:18.324
Jesus.

1:02:18.358 --> 1:02:20.228
I'm getting out.

1:02:23.931 --> 1:02:25.231
- The fuck?
- Come on.

1:02:25.264 --> 1:02:27.967
- We're just two guys talking.
- Yeah?

1:02:28.001 --> 1:02:30.204
'Cause I see one guy
trying to get out of a car

1:02:30.237 --> 1:02:32.306
and another guy
leveraged to the hilt.

1:02:32.338 --> 1:02:35.476
So's half the town,
it's the way it works.

1:02:39.512 --> 1:02:41.215
Just ask your dad for the money.

1:02:41.248 --> 1:02:44.050
Fuck you!

1:02:46.052 --> 1:02:48.388
I'm gonna get out
of the car now.

1:03:00.367 --> 1:03:01.702
The Bulls are out of time outs.

1:03:01.735 --> 1:03:03.503
Twelve seconds remain
in the fourth,

1:03:03.536 --> 1:03:05.305
the Knicks clinging
to a two-point lead,

1:03:05.338 --> 1:03:06.940
103 to 101.

1:03:06.974 --> 1:03:09.276
Knox with a career high,
26 points.

1:03:09.309 --> 1:03:11.111
- Knicks have to stand tall...
- Pull over.

1:03:11.143 --> 1:03:13.179
- We need to focus.
- So here we go.

1:03:13.213 --> 1:03:15.382
Lopez in bounds to LaVine,
guarded by Smith.

1:03:15.414 --> 1:03:17.483
Top of the key,
looking for Valentine.

1:03:17.516 --> 1:03:19.619
LaVine cuts left, drives,
six seconds.

1:03:19.652 --> 1:03:22.322
Five, pulls up,
finds Valentine in the corner.

1:03:22.356 --> 1:03:26.560
Three, two, off balance jumper,
it's good.

1:03:26.592 --> 1:03:28.628
And the Bulls pull it out...

1:03:50.416 --> 1:03:53.119
You know, you could always
just root for the Nets.

1:03:59.259 --> 1:04:02.329
You can't ever say that.

1:04:02.362 --> 1:04:03.764
Don't ever say...

1:04:03.797 --> 1:04:06.099
Don't every say that, okay?

1:04:14.173 --> 1:04:16.275
The Nets are from New Jersey.

1:04:16.309 --> 1:04:17.377
They... they're not from Brooklyn.

1:04:17.409 --> 1:04:19.112
They might play in Brooklyn,
have the word Brooklyn

1:04:19.146 --> 1:04:20.614
on their jerseys,
they're not from Brooklyn.

1:04:22.548 --> 1:04:23.717
To me, they'll always be
from New Jersey.

1:04:23.750 --> 1:04:27.054
, Daniel Martin,
born and bred in New Jersey.

1:04:30.123 --> 1:04:32.492
They destroyed an entire
neighborhood to build a stadium

1:04:32.525 --> 1:04:35.762
that looks like
a rusty metal basket.

1:04:35.795 --> 1:04:39.065
They tore down all brownstones,
a great bar.

1:04:39.099 --> 1:04:43.237
They, they forced people
to give up their homes

1:04:43.269 --> 1:04:44.405
so the Nets could move
from New Jersey

1:04:44.438 --> 1:04:47.474
just to cont... cont...
continue to suck.

1:04:47.507 --> 1:04:49.309
No, okay, okay,
you know, whatever.

1:04:49.342 --> 1:04:51.478
Maybe they're good now
and they got K-D bub,

1:04:51.510 --> 1:04:53.480
but whatever, you know?

1:04:53.512 --> 1:04:54.748
Will it last?

1:04:54.780 --> 1:04:57.183
Come on, come on.

1:04:59.719 --> 1:05:02.423
Knicks suck worse obviously,
I mean, look at them.

1:05:02.456 --> 1:05:03.624
Who even are they? Nobodies.

1:05:03.657 --> 1:05:05.726
You know, you get Zion right
there in the palm of your hand,

1:05:05.759 --> 1:05:08.161
you can't,
can't even make that work.

1:05:08.195 --> 1:05:10.264
Ha, ha, useless!

1:05:10.297 --> 1:05:11.532
Useless.

1:05:11.565 --> 1:05:13.599
But I'm actually fine
with them sucking.

1:05:13.632 --> 1:05:14.600
You know?

1:05:14.634 --> 1:05:17.336
It's, it's...

1:05:17.369 --> 1:05:18.838
It's a part of what New York
has always been,

1:05:18.871 --> 1:05:20.540
good, bad, love, hate.

1:05:20.574 --> 1:05:22.842
High, low, Empire State
Building, Flatbush Avenue,

1:05:22.876 --> 1:05:26.080
and, and, and no matter
if they won or they lost,

1:05:26.112 --> 1:05:28.548
you know, New York was
the Knicks' town, their home.

1:05:28.581 --> 1:05:31.217
They made sense together,
which would somehow help

1:05:31.251 --> 1:05:33.854
New York make any sense at all,
when I don't know...

1:05:33.887 --> 1:05:36.856
the F train breaks down,
somebody steals your bike

1:05:36.889 --> 1:05:40.193
or some, some, some monster
tears down your house

1:05:40.226 --> 1:05:42.797
to make way for a parking lot,
you know?

1:05:47.300 --> 1:05:49.836
You know, but now,

1:05:49.869 --> 1:05:52.405
with all the money
and all the bullshit luxury,

1:05:52.438 --> 1:05:53.639
none of the old stuff
makes sense anymore.

1:05:53.673 --> 1:05:55.375
Knicks don't matter, the city
doesn't care about them.

1:05:55.407 --> 1:05:58.311
The, this city...

1:05:58.344 --> 1:06:01.314
This city cares about money.

1:06:01.347 --> 1:06:03.784
They don't even care
about a loser.

1:06:06.353 --> 1:06:07.820
But someone has to care
so I've done it.

1:06:07.853 --> 1:06:09.755
I've loved them
for the millions of people

1:06:09.789 --> 1:06:11.625
who don't care anymore, I've
given them everything I've got.

1:06:11.657 --> 1:06:13.293
I've died for 'em,
I do it every time they play,

1:06:13.326 --> 1:06:15.262
but it hasn't been enough.

1:06:17.864 --> 1:06:20.867
So now, it's like
I've finally realized

1:06:20.900 --> 1:06:23.436
that maybe I have to do more,
like maybe my entire life

1:06:23.469 --> 1:06:24.670
has built up to this point

1:06:24.704 --> 1:06:27.441
where it's time to do something,
you know,

1:06:27.474 --> 1:06:30.144
to really, really do something.

1:06:36.182 --> 1:06:37.684
Do what?

1:06:41.855 --> 1:06:43.757
Avenge them.

1:07:45.784 --> 1:07:47.954
How'd he die?

1:07:47.987 --> 1:07:50.289
Who?

1:07:50.322 --> 1:07:52.558
Your father.

1:07:52.592 --> 1:07:54.695
Was it from, like,

1:07:54.728 --> 1:07:57.496
war, something?

1:07:57.530 --> 1:07:59.533
No, nothing like that.

1:07:59.565 --> 1:08:01.500
- Heart attack.
- Oh.

1:08:04.003 --> 1:08:06.606
Look, I figured... I don't know,

1:08:06.639 --> 1:08:08.574
you know, I thought maybe
he must've got killed

1:08:08.608 --> 1:08:11.778
in a conflict or something.

1:08:11.811 --> 1:08:14.381
No, he just died.

1:09:31.623 --> 1:09:33.894
I'm really glad I found you.

1:10:10.430 --> 1:10:13.033
Zama, this isn't right.

1:10:13.065 --> 1:10:15.702
We know you're angry,
but come home.

1:10:17.636 --> 1:10:19.672
Zama, you have to.

1:10:19.706 --> 1:10:21.975
You've been gone for days,
we've been worried sick.

1:10:22.007 --> 1:10:23.542
We almost called the police.

1:10:23.576 --> 1:10:26.579
No, don't do that,
don't call the police.

1:10:26.613 --> 1:10:29.449
- What?
- Not yet.

1:10:29.481 --> 1:10:32.719
Zama, what do you mean?

1:10:32.752 --> 1:10:33.987
Zama.

1:10:51.904 --> 1:10:53.539
What?

1:11:16.462 --> 1:11:18.030
Mister has been waiting for you.

1:11:18.064 --> 1:11:19.065
Thank you, Rosa.

1:11:19.097 --> 1:11:21.902
No, Rosa's gone, I'm Juanita.

1:11:21.935 --> 1:11:24.838
- How long has it been?
- Five years.

1:11:32.212 --> 1:11:34.915
Still taking your meetings here
I see.

1:11:44.090 --> 1:11:47.994
So, how's things, Pop?

1:11:48.027 --> 1:11:50.797
Ask Rosa,
she does the dirty work.

1:11:52.498 --> 1:11:55.068
I think her name's Juanita.

1:11:55.100 --> 1:11:57.938
What do you want?

1:11:57.970 --> 1:12:00.172
Did you see what I sent over?

1:12:00.206 --> 1:12:01.875
I had someone look at it.

1:12:01.908 --> 1:12:03.643
- Who?
- Someone.

1:12:03.676 --> 1:12:05.145
And?

1:12:08.046 --> 1:12:09.882
I don't have time for this,
I don't have time to come

1:12:09.916 --> 1:12:11.717
all the way over
to this shitty neighborhood.

1:12:11.751 --> 1:12:14.654
- You never understood this city.
- And I don't have time for you!

1:12:14.686 --> 1:12:16.155
You got something to say
about my proposal,

1:12:16.189 --> 1:12:18.525
just say it
so I can get back in my car.

1:12:18.557 --> 1:12:20.226
- You mean my car?
- No, my car!

1:12:20.260 --> 1:12:22.061
Mine!

1:12:28.268 --> 1:12:31.637
Sit down and stop acting
like a child.

1:12:39.279 --> 1:12:43.583
You know, Rosa's daughter
gets on a bus every morning

1:12:43.615 --> 1:12:46.819
from goddamn Rego Park
to Coney Island.

1:12:46.853 --> 1:12:50.724
Special school there
named after Mark Twain.

1:12:50.756 --> 1:12:53.692
I suppose it should be
named after Bob Moses.

1:12:53.725 --> 1:12:55.694
Rosa came back
from a parent conference

1:12:55.728 --> 1:12:58.899
and found this in a garbage can

1:12:58.931 --> 1:13:02.301
in the parking lot there.

1:13:02.335 --> 1:13:05.572
Yup, that's us.

1:13:05.604 --> 1:13:07.072
It's a good project, it's big.

1:13:07.105 --> 1:13:09.141
Calling it The Diamond Coast.

1:13:09.175 --> 1:13:11.845
And that's just the start,
six more buildings planned.

1:13:11.877 --> 1:13:13.646
We're the first in.

1:13:13.680 --> 1:13:15.849
- Bill's good with it.
- Bill?

1:13:18.685 --> 1:13:21.621
Abe, Ed, Dave,

1:13:21.654 --> 1:13:23.557
Rudy, Mike.

1:13:23.590 --> 1:13:28.028
Lists help me keep my marbles.

1:13:28.060 --> 1:13:31.030
Now you have Bill,
matters not to me.

1:13:31.064 --> 1:13:34.200
Well, it's a good project.

1:13:34.233 --> 1:13:36.603
She found it in the garbage.

1:13:36.636 --> 1:13:38.939
We're papering the area,
so what?

1:13:41.873 --> 1:13:43.809
Garbage.

1:13:43.842 --> 1:13:45.845
Wrong.

1:13:45.877 --> 1:13:50.149
We're changing the skyline,
just like you did in your day.

1:13:50.182 --> 1:13:52.752
In my day, we,
we built skyscrapers,

1:13:52.784 --> 1:13:55.588
we built roads,
neighborhoods, beaches.

1:13:55.622 --> 1:13:58.692
We built a city.

1:13:58.725 --> 1:14:01.828
We built an economy that
benefitted the entire nation.

1:14:01.860 --> 1:14:03.630
We made men rich, yes,

1:14:03.662 --> 1:14:06.332
but we made all of society
even richer.

1:14:06.365 --> 1:14:09.234
Yeah, you really saved
the world, didn't you?

1:14:09.268 --> 1:14:13.773
Tell me, who's living in
those projects

1:14:13.805 --> 1:14:15.775
you've been developing?

1:14:19.145 --> 1:14:22.382
No one.

1:14:22.414 --> 1:14:26.051
Nobody lives there.

1:14:26.085 --> 1:14:28.755
You sell them to foreigners
who keep them empty.

1:14:28.787 --> 1:14:30.889
It's not building.

1:14:30.922 --> 1:14:32.992
It's money laundering.

1:14:34.993 --> 1:14:37.096
What can I say, Pop?

1:14:37.130 --> 1:14:40.934
That's the business.

1:14:40.966 --> 1:14:43.737
Do you know why
I still come here?

1:14:45.872 --> 1:14:48.842
Because this is the first
building I ever bought.

1:14:51.778 --> 1:14:54.347
Look around you.

1:14:54.380 --> 1:14:57.951
It's still here.

1:14:57.984 --> 1:15:00.087
Still making sandwiches.

1:15:03.389 --> 1:15:06.226
You're a real martyr,
aren't you?

1:15:06.259 --> 1:15:09.796
You're a real man of the people.

1:15:09.828 --> 1:15:11.398
My whole life,
you were building this,

1:15:11.430 --> 1:15:15.201
this shining tower
for the good of the world.

1:15:15.234 --> 1:15:18.304
And I'm just...

1:15:18.337 --> 1:15:21.408
just a cardboard box
with all your shit in it.

1:15:24.444 --> 1:15:27.213
No.

1:15:27.246 --> 1:15:31.318
You are a cardboard box
with all of my money in it.

1:15:35.253 --> 1:15:38.858
I'll have them wire the money,

1:15:38.890 --> 1:15:40.960
with new terms.

1:15:45.198 --> 1:15:47.034
You can go.

1:16:34.514 --> 1:16:36.082
Money,

1:16:36.114 --> 1:16:38.751
money!

1:16:38.784 --> 1:16:40.452
Money!

1:16:51.997 --> 1:16:53.465
Woll drives, two on one,

1:16:53.498 --> 1:16:55.934
lobs to Biel for the slam.

1:16:55.967 --> 1:16:58.837
A beautiful pass
by the Kentucky...

1:17:51.858 --> 1:17:53.893
You know when you're like...

1:17:53.926 --> 1:17:56.362
you know when you're working
a job and you just...

1:17:56.395 --> 1:17:59.098
every day is just like

1:17:59.131 --> 1:18:01.401
same fucking shit, you know?

1:18:01.434 --> 1:18:05.471
And it's just not how...

1:18:05.503 --> 1:18:07.105
I don't, I don't know
what I'm saying.

1:18:10.309 --> 1:18:14.012
It's just not a... it's not...

1:18:14.046 --> 1:18:15.181
Whatever.

1:18:15.213 --> 1:18:17.984
You know what I'm talking about.

1:18:18.016 --> 1:18:20.019
You get me,
that's why I like you.

1:18:20.051 --> 1:18:21.887
That's why I like you.

1:18:55.921 --> 1:18:59.024
- Where am I?
- Give me your phone.

1:18:59.057 --> 1:19:00.659
- No.
- I need to talk to your boss.

1:19:00.693 --> 1:19:04.030
What? No.

1:19:04.063 --> 1:19:05.899
- What are you doing?
- No.

1:19:05.931 --> 1:19:08.268
- Saul, stop!
- Stop it!

1:19:08.301 --> 1:19:13.006
- Get off of him!
- How's that feel, huh?

1:19:13.038 --> 1:19:14.640
Get off of me!

1:19:14.673 --> 1:19:16.643
Get...

1:19:21.380 --> 1:19:23.583
Saul, stop!

1:19:23.615 --> 1:19:26.051
- Stay still!
- Please, please stop.

1:19:26.085 --> 1:19:28.488
- Please.
- No!

1:19:28.520 --> 1:19:31.224
Please stop, please stop,
please stop, please stop.

1:19:31.256 --> 1:19:32.424
- Stay still!
- Please stop, please stop,

1:19:32.457 --> 1:19:34.927
- please stop, please stop.
- Get off of him!

1:19:34.961 --> 1:19:38.530
Please, please, please, please.

1:19:41.967 --> 1:19:44.503
Please stop, please stop,
please.

1:19:44.537 --> 1:19:46.539
Please, please, please.

1:20:16.534 --> 1:20:18.136
I'm sorry.

1:20:31.050 --> 1:20:33.686
I really don't know what to do.

1:20:33.719 --> 1:20:37.422
- I don't know what to do.
- Shh.

1:20:48.768 --> 1:20:51.237
- Yeah?
- Bill there?

1:20:51.270 --> 1:20:53.673
Yeah, he's about to step into
a pile of shit in the Bronx.

1:20:53.706 --> 1:20:57.043
Cop got shot,
we're almost there.

1:20:57.076 --> 1:20:58.478
Put him on.

1:20:58.511 --> 1:21:01.314
Jesus, you're some kind
of prick.

1:21:06.152 --> 1:21:07.119
Are you kidding?

1:21:07.153 --> 1:21:10.023
One of my guys
just got held up in Brooklyn.

1:21:10.055 --> 1:21:12.657
It's gotta be connected to the
threat on one of my buildings.

1:21:14.527 --> 1:21:16.429
And?

1:21:16.462 --> 1:21:17.697
And I think it could be serious.

1:21:17.729 --> 1:21:20.198
They've been calling my office
for months.

1:21:20.231 --> 1:21:22.301
They showed up at that community
board thing the other day

1:21:22.333 --> 1:21:26.171
wearing a mask
and some kind of burka.

1:21:26.204 --> 1:21:29.175
Now they assault one of my team?

1:21:29.207 --> 1:21:31.610
I swear, they come near me,
I'm gonna kill 'em.

1:21:31.644 --> 1:21:34.713
Don't say that on this line.

1:21:34.747 --> 1:21:35.581
I'm just trying to warn you

1:21:35.614 --> 1:21:37.682
about a legitimate
terrorist threat.

1:21:37.716 --> 1:21:41.186
You're talking about a prank
where you got egg on your face.

1:21:41.220 --> 1:21:42.255
This is funny to you.

1:21:42.287 --> 1:21:45.157
After all that money
I poured into your campaign?

1:21:47.326 --> 1:21:49.061
Bill?

1:21:49.095 --> 1:21:52.231
Come on.

1:24:11.636 --> 1:24:13.305
Mm!

1:24:13.338 --> 1:24:17.210
Judge, Your Honor,
and to the jury,

1:24:17.243 --> 1:24:20.513
I intend to prove
beyond a shadow of doubt

1:24:20.546 --> 1:24:22.315
that we are innocent,

1:24:22.347 --> 1:24:25.318
and true love is not a crime.

1:25:40.792 --> 1:25:43.295
Well, maybe she's not alone.

1:25:50.903 --> 1:25:53.338
Whose shoes are those?

1:26:17.363 --> 1:26:20.566
So we questioned him,
took him downtown.

1:26:20.599 --> 1:26:23.101
That's it.

1:26:23.135 --> 1:26:24.936
That's all you know?

1:26:24.970 --> 1:26:29.041
Listen, whatever it was,
it's over.

1:26:29.073 --> 1:26:30.742
You can go home.

1:27:26.998 --> 1:27:28.666
What's this?

1:27:37.643 --> 1:27:39.845
Garbage.
