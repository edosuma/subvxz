you made love.

right back to this.

27:27.643 --> 27:30.143

27:33.399 --> 27:35.315
<i>'Cause it's not true.</i>

So, what, God likes your
wife better than mine?

27:56.088 --> 27:58.839
Your friend Kevin here
asked me to help you out.

27:58.841 --> 28:01.725
I owe him, so I will.

28:02.978 --> 28:04.644
But you got to tell me the truth.

28:10.152 --> 28:12.102

your wife starts to show

28:16.525 --> 28:19.609
and everybody knows she's pregnant,

28:19.611 --> 28:23.864
you need to say that you were sad

28:23.866 --> 28:27.117
and lonely and confused.

28:28.670 --> 28:31.121
And that you are very
sorry for what you did

28:32.758 --> 28:36.126
