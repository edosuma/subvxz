- synced and corrected by chamallow -

00:47.674 --> 00:50.508
In the matter of the
murder of Percival Thompson,

00:50.543 --> 00:55.212
the evidence against Mary
Thompson is unequivocal.

00:55.246 --> 00:57.214
You will learn of her fingermarks

00:57.248 --> 00:59.616
on the knife that was plunged six times

00:59.651 --> 01:02.352
into the chest of her husband.

01:02.387 --> 01:04.354
You will learn of how that
same weapon was discovered

01:04.388 --> 01:07.158
lying on her bedside the next morning.

01:07.192 --> 01:09.193
And you will learn

01:09.227 --> 01:11.595
of Mrs. Thompson's claims

01:11.629 --> 01:15.799
that she has no memory of these events.

01:15.833 --> 01:18.502
The prosecution calls
their first witness...

01:27.011 --> 01:28.978
Mrs. Mary Thompson was a patient of mine.

01:29.013 --> 01:30.980
She'd been having memory lapses.

01:31.015 --> 01:33.516
I suspected she was experiencing
what we call a fugue state.

01:33.550 --> 01:35.819
I don't require a diagnosis, Doctor.

01:35.853 --> 01:38.054
Was there another reason that Mrs. Thompson

01:38.089 --> 01:40.056
sought your professional help?

01:40.091 --> 01:42.825
Yes. She was having disturbing fantasies.

01:42.859 --> 01:46.495
- Of what?
- Killing her husband.

01:46.530 --> 01:49.164
And in these fantasies,

01:49.199 --> 01:51.400
- how did she kill her husband?
- She stabbed him

01:51.435 --> 01:54.503
repeatedly in the chest.

01:54.538 --> 01:56.868
And you took these fantasies
quite seriously, did you not?

01:56.875 --> 01:58.942
- Yes, I did.
- So seriously, in fact,

01:58.977 --> 02:01.511
that you personally contacted Mr. Thompson

02:01.546 --> 02:03.513
to warn him that his
life might be in danger!

02:03.648 --> 02:07.284
I wrote Mr. Thompson a letter. I
was unable to contact him personally.

02:07.318 --> 02:09.752
Thank you. Those are my questions.

02:10.588 --> 02:13.323
Dr. Ogden,

02:13.357 --> 02:16.159
tell us more about this "fugue state."

02:16.249 --> 02:19.652
It's a term coined by the
French psychologist Pierre Janet

02:19.686 --> 02:21.920
to describe people who disassociate

02:21.955 --> 02:24.890
from their normal identity
and take refuge in a new one.

02:24.924 --> 02:27.159
And is this a conscious decision?

02:27.193 --> 02:29.194
No. It's completely unconscious.

02:29.229 --> 02:32.831
In fact, the sufferer typically
has no memory of the episode.

02:32.866 --> 02:35.467
So this would explain why
Mary Thompson has no memory

02:35.501 --> 02:37.602
of the night her husband was murdered?

02:37.636 --> 02:40.172
- Yes, it would.
- Those are my questions,

02:40.206 --> 02:42.574
- Your Honour.
- Your Honour,

02:42.608 --> 02:45.543
- I wish to redirect.
- Proceed.

02:45.578 --> 02:48.880
Dr. Ogden, would it be possible

02:48.914 --> 02:52.484
for someone to feign this so-called state?

02:52.518 --> 02:56.388
- To what end?
- Well, to murder one's husband and blame it on

02:56.422 --> 02:59.090
a psychological anomaly.
I would suggest there are

02:59.124 --> 03:01.359
better ways to kill one's
husband than to leave a trail

03:01.394 --> 03:03.561
of evidence and hope to be
judged criminally insane.

03:03.596 --> 03:07.331
So you agree this woman should be
committed to an asylum for life?

03:07.366 --> 03:09.700
Of course.

03:09.734 --> 03:13.337
One cannot be allowed to kill one's
husband and simply get away with it.

03:13.372 --> 03:16.274
Those are my questions.

03:20.578 --> 03:23.280
Is there any mail?

03:23.314 --> 03:25.749
Thank you.

03:32.056 --> 03:35.325
"You have condemned her.
Mary Thompson is innocent."

03:40.505 --> 03:42.755
The bakery says that the
cakes will be ready at 4:00,

03:42.758 --> 03:45.293
but he closes at 5:00,
so you can't dilly-dally.

03:45.328 --> 03:47.295
And they're for the wedding?

03:47.330 --> 03:50.832
No. For the rehearsal dinner.
Are you even listening?

03:50.867 --> 03:52.834
The rehearsal dinner! What's
to rehearse? It's just two

03:52.869 --> 03:55.570
"I do's," a peck on the lips,
and one of them gets a ring.

03:55.604 --> 03:57.972
A wedding is a very
solemn occasion, Thomas.

03:58.006 --> 04:00.475
It may mean nothing to you but it did to me

04:00.509 --> 04:02.477
and it does to them, and
I'm going to make sure

04:02.511 --> 04:06.180
that at least they have a decent wedding.

04:08.316 --> 04:10.685
- Oh Julia!
- Margaret. How nice to see you.

04:10.719 --> 04:13.687
I'm so glad I bumped into
you. Dinner is set for 7:00.

04:13.721 --> 04:16.990
I've arranged for the priest
to come to run through the vows.

04:16.991 --> 04:17.591
How wonderful.

04:17.658 --> 04:20.961
- Thank you Margaret.
- Oh, uh, there won't be an organist,

04:20.995 --> 04:23.463
so we'll have to hum the Wedding March.

04:23.498 --> 04:25.665
â™ª Ahh â™ª

04:29.970 --> 04:33.339
This one, sir, should be about
two knuckles longer than this side.

04:33.374 --> 04:35.776
Then we go long over short,

04:35.810 --> 04:37.778
up through the middle,

04:37.812 --> 04:39.513
fold this side into a
bow - hence the name -

04:39.547 --> 04:42.582
come around here... when my
Aunt Azalea taught me this, sir,

04:42.617 --> 04:44.584
there was a rabbit coming
out of a hole next to a tree.

04:44.619 --> 04:47.620
There was a whole fable.
It was very confusing.

04:47.654 --> 04:49.622
Nonetheless, she did teach me

04:49.656 --> 04:52.825
that the sign of a true gentleman is
being able to tie your own bow tie.

04:52.859 --> 04:55.828
- Not that I'm suggesting you...
- I wouldn't disagree, George.

04:55.862 --> 04:57.696
Well, look at you.

04:57.731 --> 05:00.466
Um, isn't it bad luck for
the bride to see the groom

05:00.500 --> 05:02.468
in his wedding suit?

05:02.502 --> 05:06.672
Sir, I believe that's the other way
around. You should be fine... Doctor.

05:06.706 --> 05:09.875
I dare say I should marry you more often.

05:09.910 --> 05:11.877
I think once in a lifetime is
quite sufficient, thank you.

05:11.912 --> 05:13.879
How was your testimony?

05:13.914 --> 05:17.850
Well, I thought it went
fine until I received this.

05:20.553 --> 05:23.221
"You have condemned her."

05:23.256 --> 05:27.092
- Who sent this?
- I have no idea. It came in the afternoon post.

05:27.126 --> 05:32.097
- It was postmarked at noon. Two hours ago.
- Right after my testimony.

05:32.131 --> 05:35.867
William, I told the court that she should
spend the rest of her days in an asylum.

05:36.401 --> 05:38.436
If she is innocent,

05:38.471 --> 05:40.905
- I may well have condemned her.
- Hmm.

05:41.020 --> 05:43.922
The trial's half over and you
want to start an investigation?

05:43.956 --> 05:46.992
Aren't you two about to get married?

05:47.626 --> 05:50.428
Sir, Station House Number
5 investigated the case,

05:50.462 --> 05:52.430
and as we know, they aren't always

05:52.464 --> 05:54.432
as thorough as they could be.

05:54.466 --> 05:57.468
Not that they'll enjoy having that
pointed out to them. Who sent the postcard?

05:57.502 --> 05:59.836
- I have no idea.
- And why send it to you?

05:59.871 --> 06:02.506
Why not the lawyer? Or the
police, for that matter?

06:02.541 --> 06:05.342
Whoever sent it must have felt
that I would seek the truth.

06:05.377 --> 06:08.712
Right. Your first job is to
find out who sent the postcard.

06:08.746 --> 06:11.014
I suppose we'll start at the Empress Hotel.

06:11.049 --> 06:13.016
If you find anything, it will be

06:13.051 --> 06:16.887
my personal pleasure to go to Station
House 5 and request their files.

06:24.629 --> 06:26.629
William, look!

06:31.001 --> 06:34.571
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

06:34.605 --> 06:38.040
Where else might someone find one of these?

06:38.075 --> 06:40.977
We leave a complimentary
card in every room, sir.

06:41.011 --> 06:42.979
So it could have been sent by any guest.

06:43.013 --> 06:45.114
Or anyone passing through this lobby.

06:45.148 --> 06:47.516
That doesn't narrow our
list of possibilities much.

06:47.550 --> 06:51.353
No, but think of this,
Julia: The sender could have

06:51.387 --> 06:53.689
chosen any card.

06:53.724 --> 06:56.191
Why send one that could only
have come from this hotel?

06:56.226 --> 06:59.394
They wanted me to come here.

06:59.429 --> 07:03.798
Something relevant to
this case happened here.

07:03.833 --> 07:05.834
What if Mary Thompson was here

07:05.868 --> 07:07.836
the night of her husband's murder?

07:07.870 --> 07:09.871
Perhaps the sender saw her here.

07:09.905 --> 07:12.707
Why not simply state
that directly on the card?

07:12.742 --> 07:14.976
The sender may not want to be identified.

07:15.011 --> 07:18.246
- This is a hotel, after all.
- Indeed.

07:18.280 --> 07:20.782
- Ahem... Excuse me.
- Yes?

07:20.816 --> 07:23.217
Detective William Murdoch.
We'd like to have a look

07:23.252 --> 07:25.787
at your register. What was the night again?

07:25.821 --> 07:28.489
His body was found the
morning of April 11th.

07:28.524 --> 07:30.759
Right. We looking for a
Mary Thompson who checked in

07:30.793 --> 07:33.594
- on April 10th.
- April 10th...

07:33.629 --> 07:37.532
Mary Thompson, Mary Thompson...

07:37.566 --> 07:43.204
I have a Madeline Thompson,
checking in at 11:00 PM.

07:43.238 --> 07:46.073
- Madeline?
- A person in a fugue state

07:46.107 --> 07:48.976
will often adopt a new
identity. This could be her.

07:49.010 --> 07:51.444
Wasn't she found in her
home the next morning?

07:51.479 --> 07:55.415
Excuse me.

07:57.351 --> 07:59.319
When did Mrs. Thompson check out?

07:59.353 --> 08:02.455
Yes...

08:02.490 --> 08:05.625
3:30 AM, April 11th.

08:05.660 --> 08:10.163
What was the time of death?

08:10.198 --> 08:12.632
According to Dr. Grace, the
time of death was 2:00 AM, and

08:12.667 --> 08:15.735
- she was at the hotel until 3:30.
- 3:30? Why would she

08:15.769 --> 08:18.271
up and leave a hotel in
the middle of the night?

08:18.306 --> 08:21.841
We don't know, sir. She has no
memory of the evening in question.

08:21.875 --> 08:24.476
- Where was the husband killed?
- At their house.

08:24.511 --> 08:27.113
Eight blocks away.

08:27.147 --> 08:30.116
You need to confirm that this
Madeline was in fact Mary Thompson.

08:30.150 --> 08:34.687
- We'll need a photograph.
- A mug shot should suffice.

08:34.722 --> 08:37.190
Station House Number 5 should have one.

08:37.224 --> 08:39.692
That's her.

08:39.726 --> 08:42.361
This is the woman who checked
in at 11:00 on the night

08:42.395 --> 08:44.830
of the 10th and checked out
at 3:30 AM the next morning?

08:44.864 --> 08:46.998
The night clerk was here
when she checked out,

08:47.033 --> 08:49.200
but that is the woman I saw check in, yes.

08:49.835 --> 08:52.705
Very good. I'll be needing that.

08:52.739 --> 08:55.173
This?

08:55.208 --> 08:57.943
My God, this is incredible!

08:57.977 --> 08:59.945
I just assumed she'd done it.

08:59.979 --> 09:02.047
She assumed.

09:02.081 --> 09:05.050
This changes everything.

09:05.084 --> 09:07.685
And you concluded

09:07.720 --> 09:10.388
that this was the murder weapon?

09:10.422 --> 09:12.890
It matched the wounds
exactly in depth and breadth.

09:12.924 --> 09:15.025
Did you find fingermarks on the knife?

09:15.060 --> 09:17.862
We did. They belonged to the accused,

09:17.896 --> 09:20.231
Mary Thompson.

09:20.266 --> 09:23.167
Thank you, Inspector.
Those are my questions.

09:25.501 --> 09:27.253
Inspector Davis, were you aware

09:27.258 --> 09:30.040
that Mary Thompson has an alibi
for the time of her husband's death?

09:30.125 --> 09:32.459
No, I...

09:32.493 --> 09:35.296
Your Honour, I would like
to introduce as exhibit A

09:35.330 --> 09:37.298
the hotel ledger

09:37.332 --> 09:40.567
which shows that Mary Thompson checked
into the Empress Hotel at 11:00 PM

09:40.601 --> 09:42.736
and did not check out until 3:30 AM,

09:42.770 --> 09:45.339
Two hours after the time
of her husband's murder.

09:45.373 --> 09:48.208
Your Honour, this is new information,

09:48.242 --> 09:50.276
potentially unfounded. The name here

09:50.311 --> 09:52.915
- is for Madeline Thompson.
- According to Detective Murdoch,

09:52.918 --> 09:55.449
Rodney James, the hotel clerk
at the Empress Hotel, identified

09:55.483 --> 09:57.551
Mary Thompson as the woman who checked in.

09:57.585 --> 09:59.919
Detective Murdoch?

10:02.156 --> 10:06.125
-You attest to all of this?
- Yes I do, Your Honour.

10:06.160 --> 10:09.062
It means nothing. She
could have left the hotel,

10:09.096 --> 10:11.564
killed her husband, and
returned to establish an alibi.

10:11.598 --> 10:13.566
If she was merely trying
to establish an alibi,

10:13.600 --> 10:16.169
why check out at 3:30? She
could have stayed all night.

10:16.203 --> 10:19.672
Detective, is Station House
4 working for the defence?

10:19.706 --> 10:21.674
We are working for the truth.

10:21.708 --> 10:24.943
As am I. I'm convinced
she killed her husband

10:24.978 --> 10:27.246
- and I intend to prove it.
- Well, why not?

10:27.280 --> 10:29.882
It wouldn't be the first
time you believed a woman

10:29.916 --> 10:31.884
killed her husband and she
turned out to be innocent.

10:32.008 --> 10:34.276
You bring your evidence,

10:34.310 --> 10:36.378
I will bring mine.

10:43.028 --> 10:44.786
Right, if mary Thompson
didn't kill her husband,

10:44.841 --> 10:47.109
we've got to prove it. So what's the plan?

10:47.143 --> 10:49.444
We know she was at the Empress Hotel for
at least part of the night in question.

10:49.479 --> 10:51.446
I'll send Higgins to the Empress Hotel.

10:51.515 --> 10:53.549
Talk to the night clerk.
See if anyone else saw her.

10:53.583 --> 10:56.785
We should also try to determine
who the real killer might be.

10:56.820 --> 10:58.787
Who the victim is, what did he do?

10:58.822 --> 11:01.656
- He was a businessman, I believe.
- Follow the money. Crabtree,

11:01.690 --> 11:04.659
- dig into Mr. Thompson's business dealings.
- I will...

11:04.693 --> 11:06.794
So what are you standing around for?

11:06.829 --> 11:09.164
I believe we're supposed to
be at the rehearsal dinner.

11:09.198 --> 11:13.502
What time is it? Bloody hell!

11:13.536 --> 11:15.011
Here they are!

11:15.012 --> 11:16.789
- Mrs. Brackenreid.
- Constable!

11:16.805 --> 11:18.673
Where have you been? She's
been driving me crazy.

11:18.707 --> 11:20.675
You're lucky I was able to
get them here when I did.

11:20.779 --> 11:23.380
- Margaret. Sorry we're late.
- Oh, no, don't be silly.

11:23.415 --> 11:25.382
It's what rehearsals are all about.

11:25.417 --> 11:27.384
Detective.
- Mrs. Brackenreid.

11:27.419 --> 11:30.054
Father Clements has been
waiting half an hour.

11:30.089 --> 11:32.056
I thought that's what
rehearsals were all about.

11:32.091 --> 11:34.058
Don't try to be smart
Thomas. It doesn't suit you.

11:36.428 --> 11:39.130
Alright, everyone. Father Clements

11:39.164 --> 11:42.433
doesn't have much time,
so we'll get right to it.

11:42.467 --> 11:44.435
Detective, you will be
at the front of the aisle

11:44.469 --> 11:46.403
with your best man. Who is your best man?

11:46.438 --> 11:52.342
Oh, I don't... what does a best man do?

11:52.376 --> 11:55.812
- Well, traditionally...
- He gives you the ring.

11:55.847 --> 11:58.682
- I have the ring.
- Well, pick a best man,

11:58.716 --> 12:02.653
give him the ring and
he'll hand it back to you.

12:02.687 --> 12:05.321
- Just do it.
- Right.

12:05.356 --> 12:08.824
George, if you would, please...

12:08.859 --> 12:10.826
Sir...

12:10.861 --> 12:13.963
Do you really... Oh!

12:13.997 --> 12:15.665
I don't know what to say.

12:15.699 --> 12:18.134
Yes, of course!

12:18.169 --> 12:20.136
I'm honoured, sir. I won't let you down.

12:20.171 --> 12:23.005
All right. Very good. Thank you.

12:23.040 --> 12:25.975
Well, get up there with him. Go! Up!

12:26.009 --> 12:28.144
Up, up, up! Wonderful.

12:28.178 --> 12:33.382
Excellent. Now, Dr. Grace. Yes?

12:33.416 --> 12:35.885
As the maid of honour, you
are the first down the aisle.

12:35.919 --> 12:38.154
So, you must start marching the moment

12:38.188 --> 12:41.190
the organist begins to
play the Wedding March.

12:43.893 --> 12:46.461
Traditionally, this is
the moment where the father

12:46.496 --> 12:50.131
of the bride takes your arm
to lead you down the aisle,

12:50.166 --> 12:52.734
but seeing as your father has passed

12:52.768 --> 12:55.003
you'll have to do it on your own.

12:55.037 --> 12:57.839
Actually, I was wondering if you might

12:57.873 --> 12:59.841
give me away, Inspector?

12:59.875 --> 13:03.011
Oh! I'd be honoured!

13:03.045 --> 13:07.082
No drinking before the wedding, then.

13:07.116 --> 13:11.720
All right, everybody please hum!

13:11.754 --> 13:15.423
Not too fast, Dr. Grace.

13:15.457 --> 13:18.025
Remember to follow the beat.
It's step-together-step.

13:18.059 --> 13:20.994
Now Thomas, you... â™ª
Step in with the bride â™ª

13:21.029 --> 13:24.265
Well! Very nice. Well done!

13:24.299 --> 13:26.601
She's done this before, Margaret.

13:32.573 --> 13:35.909
- Well done!
- Yes, and I take it from here.

13:35.944 --> 13:37.911
Thank you for that rousing rendition.

13:37.946 --> 13:42.349
As we discussed, I will be
forgoing the traditional mass...

13:42.383 --> 13:44.785
Why don't they just get
married and have done with it?

13:44.819 --> 13:47.520
- Everyone's here.
- The musicians aren't.

13:47.555 --> 13:51.190
You've hummed them to the
altar. What more is there?

13:51.225 --> 13:53.293
The Wedding Waltz, Thomas.

13:53.327 --> 13:55.395
Don't you remember the Wedding Waltz

13:55.429 --> 13:57.430
Oh, no; of course you don't.

13:57.465 --> 13:59.466
You were three sheets to the wind by then.

14:02.970 --> 14:05.371
And from there we'll
proceed directly to the vows.

14:05.455 --> 14:08.224
I will ask you if you take your bride

14:08.258 --> 14:10.226
in sickness and in health,
'til death do you part,

14:10.260 --> 14:12.528
and you will answer...

14:12.562 --> 14:14.864
I do.

14:14.898 --> 14:18.167
And I will ask you the
same and you will answer...

14:18.202 --> 14:20.836
I do.

14:20.870 --> 14:23.505
And then you will pass William the ring.

14:23.540 --> 14:27.042
- Oh! Sir...
- Thank you, George.

14:27.076 --> 14:29.044
And we'll leave that for tomorrow.

14:29.078 --> 14:31.146
Oh... Of course.

14:31.180 --> 14:34.650
- I'd best hold onto that, sir.
- Are you sure, George?

14:34.684 --> 14:38.686
I'm the best man.

14:46.495 --> 14:48.496
Who's Alexander Wainwright?

14:48.530 --> 14:50.498
He was the victim's business partner.

14:50.532 --> 14:52.500
- What kind of business?
- Manufacturing. They moved

14:52.534 --> 14:54.802
to Toronto in January
to set up a tire factory.

14:54.837 --> 14:56.937
The two of them bought
an old mattress factory

14:56.972 --> 14:59.139
on Dufferin Street and were
in the process of converting it

14:59.174 --> 15:01.141
when Thompson was killed.

15:01.176 --> 15:03.411
- Anything out of the ordinary?
- Well, since Thompson's death,

15:03.445 --> 15:06.347
Wainwright has been liquidating
all the business's assets.

15:06.382 --> 15:08.483
Sounds fishy.

15:08.517 --> 15:12.152
Now, see, sir, I would think a fish
would make almost no sound at all...

15:12.187 --> 15:14.121
- George.
- You're right though, sir.

15:14.155 --> 15:16.257
Both men signed an agreement

15:16.291 --> 15:18.359
stating that in the case
of either man's death,

15:18.393 --> 15:20.560
all the assets of the business
would accrue to the other.

15:20.595 --> 15:22.662
That's interesting.

15:22.697 --> 15:25.032
- Why would they sign such an agreement?
- I don't know.

15:25.066 --> 15:26.633
The lawyer drafted the agreement

15:26.667 --> 15:29.536
at the request of Wainwright.
And the lawyer said he never

15:29.570 --> 15:32.372
met Thompson, apparently he
was something of a recluse.

15:32.407 --> 15:34.374
When was this agreement signed?

15:34.409 --> 15:36.843
April 4th. A week before he was killed.

15:37.578 --> 15:40.447
Now that is interesting.

15:44.551 --> 15:46.585
This is Mr. Thompson?

15:46.620 --> 15:48.388
Yes. It was taken in Kingston,

15:48.422 --> 15:50.990
just after we formed our partnership.

15:51.025 --> 15:53.859
Percy brought the know-how.
I brought the money.

15:53.894 --> 15:56.029
We were going to make a fortune.

15:56.063 --> 15:59.965
Anyway, you're not here

15:59.999 --> 16:02.267
to talk about my sad story.

16:02.302 --> 16:05.771
I'd like to know about the document
giving you 100 per cent of the company

16:05.806 --> 16:07.907
in the event of your partner's death.

16:07.941 --> 16:09.909
It was a perfectly
legitimate business agreement.

16:09.943 --> 16:11.911
Signed a week prior to
your partner's murder.

16:11.945 --> 16:14.246
The timing is suspicious.

16:14.280 --> 16:16.848
I'm sure it strikes you as suspicious.

16:16.882 --> 16:19.017
Unfortunately, I can't
talk about it right now.

16:19.052 --> 16:21.920
- I have an important engagement.
- Perhaps you'd prefer

16:21.955 --> 16:23.888
to continue this conversation
down at the station house.

16:23.923 --> 16:26.291
I can't. I'm due to give
testimony on this exact matter.

16:26.326 --> 16:29.094
Questions will be asked and answered.

16:29.128 --> 16:33.397
If you have any remaining,
I'll answer them when I'm done.

16:37.135 --> 16:38.630
We had arranged to meet for breakfast.

16:38.631 --> 16:40.717
When Percy didn't arrive,
I went to his house.

16:40.873 --> 16:43.007
The door was locked and
there wasn't an answer.

16:43.041 --> 16:46.277
- And were you concerned?
- I had a feeling something wasn't right,

16:46.311 --> 16:49.347
- so I summoned a Constable.
- And what happened then?

16:49.381 --> 16:53.917
I found Percy stabbed to death in his bed.

16:53.952 --> 16:57.754
- And Mrs. Thompson?
- We found her in the next room,

16:57.789 --> 16:59.957
asleep, the bloody knife beside her.

16:59.992 --> 17:04.362
- What happened when you tried to awaken her?
- She looked at the knife

17:04.396 --> 17:07.698
and said, "I killed him.
I finally killed him."

17:11.469 --> 17:15.405
I've seen Detective Murdoch
smile exactly 343 times,

17:15.439 --> 17:18.375
342 of which were when Dr.
Ogden walked into his office.

17:18.409 --> 17:20.377
The other time was...

17:20.411 --> 17:22.378
... What?

17:22.413 --> 17:26.383
I'm asking you.

17:26.416 --> 17:28.651
Henry, Detective Murdoch has
chosen me to be his best man.

17:28.685 --> 17:31.488
Yes, I am fully aware of that, George.

17:31.522 --> 17:33.789
As is everyone else in this Station House.

17:33.824 --> 17:37.727
And as best man, it is
incumbent upon me to give a toast

17:37.761 --> 17:40.496
extolling the union of
the bride and the groom

17:40.531 --> 17:43.132
in an amusing yet heartfelt manner.

17:43.166 --> 17:46.669
Now, he smiles when he sees her,

17:46.703 --> 17:49.038
yet he's not the smiley sort.

17:49.072 --> 17:51.206
He smiles at lots of things.

17:51.241 --> 17:53.208
Uh, every time he solves a case.

17:53.243 --> 17:55.144
In fact, he smiles twice,

17:55.178 --> 17:57.579
once when he just thinks
that he's solved the case,

17:57.613 --> 17:59.581
and then again when he actually has.

17:59.615 --> 18:01.816
That's quite funny,
Henry. I might use that.

18:01.851 --> 18:04.153
"When he thinks he's solved... "

18:04.187 --> 18:06.321
Henry, what have you found out
about Mary Thompson's movements

18:06.356 --> 18:08.323
on the night of the murder?

18:08.358 --> 18:11.426
Well, she checked in under the name
Madeline, sir. She arrived at 11:00 PM.

18:11.460 --> 18:13.662
The bartender remembers
seeing her around midnight

18:13.696 --> 18:15.664
having a drink in the
lounge with a gentleman.

18:15.698 --> 18:18.567
- Who was he?
- He didn't know.

18:18.601 --> 18:21.102
He only saw the man from
behind. He had dark hair, though.

18:21.136 --> 18:23.738
Right. What about the night clerk?

18:23.773 --> 18:26.240
He's still asleep, sir.
He works the night shift.

18:26.275 --> 18:28.909
Well, Henry, wake him up. This can't wait.

18:28.944 --> 18:31.011
Sir.

18:31.046 --> 18:33.013
He could be the sender of the postcard.

18:33.048 --> 18:36.384
Possibly, but how do we find out?

18:36.418 --> 18:39.820
You're with a man.

18:39.854 --> 18:43.357
You're both sitting
together in the hotel lounge.

18:46.360 --> 18:50.064
I... can't see.

18:50.098 --> 18:52.199
He has dark hair.

18:52.233 --> 18:54.635
... Yes.

18:54.669 --> 18:57.938
There is a man.

18:57.973 --> 19:00.640
We were walking down the hall.

19:00.674 --> 19:04.344
- Do you know this man?
- Yes.

19:04.378 --> 19:06.913
Who is it?

19:06.947 --> 19:09.782
I can't see his face.

19:09.817 --> 19:13.253
I'm leaning on him.

19:13.287 --> 19:16.256
Are you drunk?

19:16.290 --> 19:18.157
No...

19:18.191 --> 19:21.928
I'm tired.

19:21.962 --> 19:24.263
I'm so dizzy and tired.

19:24.297 --> 19:27.299
I can barely stand up.

19:34.307 --> 19:36.408
Of course she was tired,
it was 3:30 in the morning.

19:36.443 --> 19:39.345
- The way she described it
- I think she may have been drugged.

19:39.379 --> 19:42.248
- Where were they heading?
- To the front desk.

19:42.282 --> 19:45.083
Higgins! Where's that night clerk?

19:45.118 --> 19:48.287
- He'll be in at noon, sir.
- Noon? Get him in here now.

19:48.321 --> 19:50.488
I can't. He's been
called in for questioning

19:50.523 --> 19:53.358
- by Station House 5.
- Oh! Bloody Davis!

19:53.392 --> 19:55.761
Dr. Grace. How can we help you?

19:55.795 --> 19:58.797
I've just been subpoenaed to
testify against Mary Thompson.

20:00.567 --> 20:03.635
Doctor Grace. At what time did
you determine the victim died?

20:03.670 --> 20:06.638
- Between 12:30 and 2:00 AM.
- And how did you determine that?

20:06.672 --> 20:10.642
Well, there were a number of
factors. Lividity, for one.

20:10.676 --> 20:12.644
Which is the extent to
which the blood settles

20:12.678 --> 20:14.646
into the lower parts of the corpse, hmm?

20:14.680 --> 20:16.614
- Yes, that's correct.
- What other factors?

20:16.649 --> 20:18.949
Internal body temperatures.

20:18.984 --> 20:22.853
A corpse will cool at a very specific
rate depending on the ambient temperature.

20:22.888 --> 20:25.956
How could you determine
the ambient temperature

20:25.991 --> 20:28.959
- at the time of death when you weren't in the room?
- I estimated.

20:28.994 --> 20:32.663
Ah... So you guessed. And
the initial body temperature?

20:32.698 --> 20:35.566
Different people have different
body temperatures at different times.

20:35.600 --> 20:38.903
- I assumed 98 degrees.
- So, you guessed again.

20:38.937 --> 20:41.004
Is it fair to say

20:41.038 --> 20:43.873
that with every estimate
and assumption, there would

20:43.908 --> 20:46.876
- be a margin of error?
- Yes, of course.

20:46.911 --> 20:49.279
And when compounded, these errors

20:49.314 --> 20:50.480
could throw off your calculations

20:50.515 --> 20:54.851
- by a wide margin?
- I suppose.

20:54.885 --> 20:56.886
So it's possible, therefore,
that the victim in fact

20:56.921 --> 20:58.888
could have died at, say,

20:58.923 --> 21:01.524
4:00 AM instead of 2:00?

21:01.558 --> 21:04.761
Yes, it's possible.

21:04.795 --> 21:07.697
Thank you.

21:07.732 --> 21:09.665
Mr. Prue,

21:09.700 --> 21:11.835
were you the night clerk on duty

21:11.869 --> 21:14.103
when Mrs. Thompson checked
out of the Empress Hotel?

21:14.137 --> 21:16.105
Yes I was.

21:16.139 --> 21:20.409
- And what time was this?
- 3:30 in the morning.

21:20.444 --> 21:22.811
And was she with anyone at the time?

21:22.846 --> 21:24.880
Yes. Her husband.

21:24.914 --> 21:28.884
- Her husband?
- Yes.

21:28.918 --> 21:30.953
So despite the opinion of the coroner,

21:30.987 --> 21:35.590
- Mr. Thompson was alive at 3:30?
- Yes.

21:35.625 --> 21:38.627
- Very much so.
- Thank you.

21:41.818 --> 21:45.418
I hate to admit it, Julia, but
if Mr. Thompson was alive at 3:30,

21:45.419 --> 21:47.454
then his wife very well
could have killed him.

21:47.927 --> 21:49.894
If you believe Dr. Grace to have been wrong

21:49.929 --> 21:52.964
- in her calculations.
- Sir. Doctor.

21:52.998 --> 21:54.524
- George.
- Sir, if we could have a moment...

21:56.525 --> 21:58.284
Sir, wonderful news.

21:58.337 --> 22:01.205
Mr. Pendrick has arranged
for a beautiful coach

22:01.240 --> 22:03.508
for your marriage. Regrettably,
the lads are talking about

22:03.542 --> 22:05.543
attaching noise-makers to it.

22:05.577 --> 22:07.545
Empty tin cans and
whatnot. Nothing explosive,

22:07.579 --> 22:10.906
but as your best man, I thought
you should be forewarned.

22:10.907 --> 22:11.707
Excuse me. William.

22:11.750 --> 22:14.952
This was sent to the courthouse.

22:14.986 --> 22:17.921
"The man she was with was not her husband."

22:18.156 --> 22:20.390
George,

22:20.424 --> 22:22.726
I need you to go to Wainwright's office.

22:22.760 --> 22:26.296
On the wall there, you'll find a portrait
of Mr. Wainwright and Mr. Thompson.

22:26.331 --> 22:28.297
Please bring it here as quickly as you can.

22:28.332 --> 22:31.167
Sir.

22:31.201 --> 22:33.370
Mr. Prue, how did you know

22:33.404 --> 22:35.171
the man with Mrs. Thompson was her husband?

22:35.205 --> 22:37.741
They were wearing matching wedding rings.

22:37.775 --> 22:42.111
You don't see that very often.
A man wearing a wedding ring.

22:42.145 --> 22:44.446
Mr. Prue...

22:48.919 --> 22:51.687
- Sir... Excuse me.
- Thank you, George.

22:51.721 --> 22:55.191
Your Honour, new evidence may have emerged

22:55.225 --> 22:58.327
- and defense requests a short recess to review it.
- Denied.

22:58.362 --> 23:01.663
Any questions you have, you
can put before the court now.

23:01.698 --> 23:04.366
Thank you, Your Honour.

23:04.401 --> 23:08.670
One moment please.

23:08.705 --> 23:11.673
Look, I can't do this.
What if the night clerk

23:11.708 --> 23:13.809
identifies the man she
was with as her husband?

23:13.843 --> 23:15.878
Then that will be the truth of it.

23:15.912 --> 23:19.680
My job is not about finding the
truth. It's about defending my client.

23:19.715 --> 23:22.817
Detective Murdoch, do
you have something to say?

23:22.851 --> 23:26.687
Your Honour, we need to confirm
that it was indeed Percival Thompson

23:26.722 --> 23:29.524
whom the night clerk saw
on the night in question.

23:29.558 --> 23:32.193
I have a photograph of Mr. Thompson.

23:32.228 --> 23:34.495
How are we to know

23:34.530 --> 23:36.497
that this is in fact
the defendant's husband?

23:36.532 --> 23:40.302
- Ask his wife.
- The defense has no further questions.

23:40.436 --> 23:43.538
Well, I do. Detective, if you will.

23:43.572 --> 23:45.706
Your Honour, this is highly irregular.

23:45.741 --> 23:48.075
Duly noted. Proceed.

23:54.049 --> 23:58.252
Mrs. Thompson, do you
see your husband Percival

23:58.286 --> 24:00.520
- in this photograph?
- Yes.

24:00.555 --> 24:03.223
Could you please point to him.

24:06.194 --> 24:10.263
Thank you.

24:10.297 --> 24:12.599
Mr. Prue,

24:12.633 --> 24:17.804
is the man that you saw with Mrs. Thompson

24:17.839 --> 24:21.207
on the morning of April
11th in this photograph?

24:21.241 --> 24:24.710
- Yes.
- Could you please point to him.

24:27.448 --> 24:29.415
Are you quite sure?

24:29.450 --> 24:32.318
I'm positive. I never forget a face.

24:34.989 --> 24:37.390
Let the court record show
that the witness indicates

24:37.424 --> 24:39.392
the man he saw on the night in question

24:39.426 --> 24:42.227
with Mrs. Thompson was
Alexander Wainwright,

24:42.261 --> 24:44.630
not Percival Thompson.

24:49.135 --> 24:52.037
So your contention is that
Wainwright murdered his partner?

24:52.071 --> 24:54.874
That's why he arranged for
Thompson to sign that agreement.

24:54.908 --> 24:56.908
He knew that with his partner dead,

24:56.942 --> 25:00.278
Wainwright would become the obvious
suspect. He had to frame someone else.

25:00.313 --> 25:02.580
He knew about Mary
Thompson's fugue episodes,

25:02.615 --> 25:04.616
knew that she would have no memory of them.

25:04.650 --> 25:07.919
How did he know she was
having such an episode

25:07.953 --> 25:10.955
- on the night in question?
- Thompson could have informed him.

25:10.990 --> 25:13.224
They were partners after all.

25:13.258 --> 25:16.127
- That's speculation.
- Well, do you have a more compelling theory?

25:18.497 --> 25:20.464
Wainwright drugged Mrs. Thompson.

25:20.499 --> 25:22.433
He took her key.

25:22.467 --> 25:24.969
He then went and stabbed
her husband to death.

25:25.004 --> 25:27.572
He returned to collect Mrs. Thompson.

25:27.606 --> 25:30.941
- ... Who was too drugged to know what was happening.
- He brought Mrs. Thompson home,

25:30.975 --> 25:33.277
clasped her hand around the murder weapon,

25:33.311 --> 25:36.447
and then placed her in the room
next door to her dead husband.

25:36.481 --> 25:39.483
Knowing she would still be there when
he summoned a Constable the next day.

25:39.518 --> 25:42.319
It's a good theory, I would just like

25:42.354 --> 25:44.321
to hear what Mr. Wainwright has to say.

25:44.356 --> 25:47.591
Mm-hmm, as would I.

25:47.625 --> 25:51.127
Uh, this is a private meeting, Constable.

25:51.162 --> 25:53.564
Please allow me this
indulgence, Your Honour.

25:53.598 --> 25:55.566
What have you, George?

25:55.600 --> 25:57.734
Sir, there's no sign of
Mr. Wainwright. His office

25:57.769 --> 25:59.770
has been cleaned out. Same
with his home on Clancy Street.

25:59.804 --> 26:02.439
- Did you speak with his lawyer?
- I did. Wainwright was there

26:02.473 --> 26:04.974
most of the morning. He's
cashed out his company's holdings

26:05.008 --> 26:07.043
in the form of bearer bonds.

26:07.078 --> 26:09.212
He's fleeing with his ill-gotten
gains. Thank you, George.

26:09.246 --> 26:12.715
Post constables at all railway stations.

26:12.749 --> 26:14.985
Sir.

26:15.039 --> 26:17.107
Given that this is Station
House Number 5's case,

26:17.141 --> 26:20.376
perhaps they could assist with
a few Constables of their own?

26:20.410 --> 26:22.378
I'll speak with Inspector Davis. You'll get

26:22.412 --> 26:24.647
whatever you need. Your Honour,

26:24.681 --> 26:26.816
in light of this new evidence, the Crown

26:26.850 --> 26:29.385
hereby removes all charges
against Mrs. Thompson.

26:29.419 --> 26:32.655
Mr. Bennett, you can inform your client

26:32.689 --> 26:34.924
- that she is free to go.
- Thank you, Your Honour.

26:34.958 --> 26:38.927
I can't thank you enough.
Thank you, Detective.

26:46.102 --> 26:48.904
You could not have given
me a better wedding present.

26:48.938 --> 26:51.540
You are very welcome, Dr. Ogden.

26:51.574 --> 26:55.109
Were we meant to give each other gifts?

26:58.480 --> 27:00.615
Let's get married, Mr. Murdoch.

27:00.650 --> 27:02.651
Indeed.

27:09.886 --> 27:11.854
No, I need them to be equal,

27:11.888 --> 27:14.090
so just put it over two rungs to the right,

27:14.124 --> 27:17.726
and everything will be
okay. Beautiful. All right.

27:17.760 --> 27:20.295
No, you need to move
it back at least a foot.

27:20.329 --> 27:23.866
We need to fit 8 tables in here. Thank you.

27:23.900 --> 27:28.737
All right... One, two, three.

27:28.771 --> 27:32.040
Perfect.

27:32.474 --> 27:35.243
Hurry on, Higgins. We'll be late.

27:35.277 --> 27:37.245
- You're not going in uniform?
- Of course not.

27:37.279 --> 27:39.247
I bought a suit especially
for the occasion.

27:39.281 --> 27:43.251
I am the best man after all. Ah, the ring.

27:43.285 --> 27:45.786
Best not forget that.

27:51.560 --> 27:53.528
All right, where is it?

27:53.612 --> 27:57.648
- I don't have it.
- Higgins, I don't have time for this.

27:57.683 --> 28:01.151
- Why would I take the ring, George?
- Oh, I don't know, maybe

28:01.186 --> 28:04.154
because you're jealous that Detective
Murdoch picked me to be best man.

28:04.189 --> 28:07.991
More likely because you've been lording
that status ever since it was granted.

28:08.025 --> 28:12.296
- "Lording"?
- You've used the term "best man" exactly 343 times

28:12.330 --> 28:14.764
- in the last two days.
- Alright. Fair enough.

28:14.799 --> 28:17.767
I see how you could take it that way.

28:17.802 --> 28:19.769
I apologize for said lording.

28:19.804 --> 28:21.771
Now please just give me back the ring.

28:21.806 --> 28:25.274
George, I don't have
it. And if you don't...

28:25.309 --> 28:27.844
You best tell him sooner than later.

28:34.318 --> 28:38.387
Oh Lord. Oh Lord.

28:49.299 --> 28:51.900
Oh, Julia. It's so beautiful.

28:51.935 --> 28:54.670
You don't think it's too... white?

28:54.704 --> 28:57.606
It's not white. It's
cream. Anyone can see that.

28:57.641 --> 28:59.642
And if they can't, that's their bother.

28:59.676 --> 29:02.444
That must be your bouquet.

29:10.253 --> 29:12.320
Thank you.

29:14.323 --> 29:16.891
Was it the bouquet?

29:16.925 --> 29:20.295
- Mrs. Thompson.
- I'm so sorry to interrupt,

29:20.329 --> 29:22.564
but I'm leaving town

29:22.598 --> 29:24.899
and I wanted to thank you.

29:24.933 --> 29:28.670
You saved my life.

29:28.704 --> 29:31.105
I'll get it.

29:31.140 --> 29:33.240
I couldn't be happier for you.

29:33.275 --> 29:35.409
When are you leaving?

29:35.443 --> 29:37.979
Today, on the 6:32.

29:38.013 --> 29:40.548
I've decided to stay with
my sister for a while.

29:40.582 --> 29:42.550
I understand completely.

29:42.584 --> 29:45.719
Thank you, Dr. Ogden.

29:45.753 --> 29:49.690
And I wish you the very best.

29:49.724 --> 29:53.794
And I you, Mary.

30:01.402 --> 30:05.706
- A bit nervous are you?
- A bit, sir, I suppose.

30:05.740 --> 30:08.675
Don't worry, Murdoch. You'll do just fine.

30:08.710 --> 30:12.412
I'm sure you're right. It's
just a ceremony, after all.

30:12.446 --> 30:16.083
I'm not talking about the
ceremony, me old mucker.

30:16.117 --> 30:18.251
Sir...

30:18.285 --> 30:20.853
I'll say this just once.

30:20.887 --> 30:24.023
She has experience. You don't.

30:24.057 --> 30:27.860
- That can be challenge for a man.
- Sir, I really...

30:27.894 --> 30:31.297
- Trust me. I've been there.
- Mrs. Brackenreid?

30:31.332 --> 30:33.833
Margaret? God, no.

30:33.867 --> 30:37.302
I'm talking about Suzie
Waters from Barnsley.

30:37.337 --> 30:39.538
I know I wasn't the first
past the post with her.

30:39.572 --> 30:43.909
The trick, Murdoch, is to fake it.

30:43.944 --> 30:46.478
Fake it, sir?

30:46.512 --> 30:49.248
Convince yourself that every
time you imagined doing it,

30:49.282 --> 30:51.283
you actually did it.

30:51.317 --> 30:53.285
Show her who's the man.

30:53.319 --> 30:56.121
That's what she wants.

30:56.155 --> 31:00.158
Don't, whatever you
do, let her take charge.

31:00.192 --> 31:04.263
That road leads to nowhere good.

31:42.000 --> 31:44.001
Cutting it rather close, aren't you?

31:44.035 --> 31:47.971
- I believe we've got two minutes to spare.
- Ah! Hmm. Where's the bride?

31:48.006 --> 31:50.607
- I'm sure she'll be along soon.
- What's the rush?

31:50.641 --> 31:53.443
The quartet's only booked until 8:00.

31:53.477 --> 31:56.680
Oh! There she is now.

31:56.714 --> 31:59.282
You mustn't see the
bride before the wedding!

31:59.317 --> 32:01.284
- It's fine, I'm sure...
- Thomas!

32:01.319 --> 32:03.286
Let's get you married, Murdoch.

33:13.489 --> 33:16.090
The best man has yet to arrive.

33:16.124 --> 33:19.493
- That's his tough luck.
- He has the ring.

33:19.527 --> 33:21.495
William Murdoch, Julia Ogden...

33:21.529 --> 33:23.430
Bloody hell.

33:23.464 --> 33:25.565
... it makes me so happy to see you

33:25.600 --> 33:27.634
here before me today, coming as you have

33:27.668 --> 33:30.604
to enter into the bonds of holy matrimony.

33:30.638 --> 33:33.274
Oh... Hurry up, Buggaluggs!

33:33.308 --> 33:36.910
Sir, sir...

33:36.944 --> 33:39.979
I lost the ring, sir. There was a hole in
my pocket and it must have fallen through.

33:40.014 --> 33:43.550
- Chuffing hell, Crabtree.
- I've looked everywhere for it, sir.

33:43.584 --> 33:46.453
Never mind. We'll use Margaret's.

33:46.487 --> 33:49.656
George! George! I found
it in your typewriter.

33:49.690 --> 33:51.724
Oh... Henry,

33:51.758 --> 33:54.894
you're my best man!

33:54.929 --> 33:57.863
OY! Stop that! Come on!

34:00.034 --> 34:04.670
Man and woman are not two,
but they are one. This union,

34:04.704 --> 34:07.506
that God has made, cannot be separated.

34:07.541 --> 34:11.444
George! You have the ring?

34:11.478 --> 34:13.846
Yes. Of course.

34:16.483 --> 34:18.984
And Paul said in 1 Corinthians 13:

34:19.018 --> 34:25.090
"If I speak in the tongues
of men and of angels... "

34:25.123 --> 34:27.960
Julia.
- What is it?

34:27.994 --> 34:31.496
Why was Wainwright wearing Thompson's ring

34:31.530 --> 34:34.199
the night the hotel clerk first saw him?

34:34.233 --> 34:39.371
He was trying to
impersonate him, I suppose.

34:39.405 --> 34:41.505
Wouldn't Mrs. Thompson have noticed

34:41.540 --> 34:44.641
if the man was wearing
her husband's wedding ring?

34:44.677 --> 34:47.645
"If I have given away all that I have... "

34:47.679 --> 34:49.614
What if it's the reverse?

34:49.648 --> 34:53.518
- The reverse?
- What if the man

34:53.552 --> 34:56.454
the night clerk saw was her husband?

34:56.489 --> 34:59.023
Impersonating Wainwright?

34:59.057 --> 35:01.592
Has anybody ever met Mr. Thompson?

35:03.595 --> 35:06.864
- His wife identified him.
- She could have lied.

35:06.898 --> 35:09.867
Who would think to question her?

35:09.901 --> 35:13.704
Especially when she was the
main suspect in his murder.

35:13.738 --> 35:17.040
So the person sending the
postcard and telegram...

35:17.074 --> 35:19.075
... Was her husband.

35:22.514 --> 35:26.016
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

35:26.050 --> 35:29.185
- "Love never ends."
- She's leaving town.

35:29.220 --> 35:32.889
On the 6:32. We have to stop them!

35:32.923 --> 35:35.492
- Yes.
- Thomas!

35:35.526 --> 35:38.761
Stop right there! What's going on?

35:38.795 --> 35:41.097
Inspector, Mrs. Mary
Thompson and her husband

35:41.132 --> 35:43.099
are getting away with murder.

35:43.134 --> 35:45.668
- Whose husband?
- Thompson is Wainwright.

35:45.702 --> 35:48.037
- Wainwright is Thompson.
- Who's dead?

35:48.071 --> 35:51.340
- Wainwright.
- Sir, we've got no time to waste. They're getting away.

35:51.374 --> 35:54.510
I don't bloody care. You're not
leaving until you're officially married.

35:54.545 --> 35:57.513
- Sir...
- I said...

35:57.548 --> 36:00.215
Get married!

36:03.119 --> 36:06.555
- He's right.
- Yes, yes of course. Of course.

36:11.261 --> 36:13.529
- Welcome back.
- Can we hurry?

36:13.563 --> 36:16.798
Yes. "And the Lord God said,

36:16.832 --> 36:20.735
'It is not good that
the man should be alone.

36:20.770 --> 36:22.871
I will make him a helpmate."
And so from the soil,

36:22.905 --> 36:25.807
the Lord God fashioned
all the wild beasts... '"

36:25.841 --> 36:28.009
- Father... The vows.
- Yes?

36:31.113 --> 36:34.315
Of course. William Murdoch,

36:34.349 --> 36:37.785
do you take this woman to be your wife?

36:37.819 --> 36:41.055
Do you promise to be true
to her in good times and bad,

36:41.090 --> 36:44.925
in sickness and in health,
do you promise to love her

36:44.960 --> 36:49.063
and honour her all the days of your life?

36:49.098 --> 36:51.065
I do.

36:51.100 --> 36:53.634
And do you, Julia, take
this man to be your husband?

36:53.668 --> 36:57.104
- Do you promise to...
- I do. I truly do.

36:59.707 --> 37:01.874
Then by the authority
of the church, I ratify

37:01.909 --> 37:03.977
and bless this bond of marriage
in the name of the Father,

37:04.011 --> 37:08.648
Son and Holy Spirit. Amen.

37:08.682 --> 37:13.019
- The ring.
- Oh... George.

37:16.356 --> 37:18.357
Oh, that's quite clever.

37:32.405 --> 37:36.273
George, Henry. There's a
6:32 train bound for Buffalo.

37:36.308 --> 37:37.142
Go to Union Station,

37:37.276 --> 37:39.611
have the constables look
for Mary Thompson. And have

37:39.646 --> 37:42.114
someone man the call box.

37:42.148 --> 37:45.350
- Sir.
- But the reception...

37:45.384 --> 37:47.585
Wainwright was the money man.

37:47.620 --> 37:49.720
Thompson had a fortune
to gain by his death.

37:49.755 --> 37:51.956
But if Thompson was
pretending to be Wainwright,

37:51.990 --> 37:54.692
- then where was Wainwright?
- Not in Toronto.

37:54.726 --> 37:57.629
Thompson came ahead of time to
establish himself as Wainwright.

37:57.663 --> 38:00.298
Once the real Mr. Wainwright
arrived, he was killed.

38:00.332 --> 38:03.301
And Mary pretended the
victim was her husband.

38:03.335 --> 38:05.970
What on Earth, William?

38:06.004 --> 38:09.506
Oh, the lads from the station house...

38:09.541 --> 38:12.877
Hopefully Mrs. Thompson is still at home.

38:15.447 --> 38:18.482
Hello. Where's Mrs. Thompson?

38:18.516 --> 38:20.851
- She's gone.
- Gone where?

38:20.886 --> 38:23.487
Don Station, I believe.

38:23.521 --> 38:26.490
William, they're not crossing the
border; they're trying to flee east.

38:26.524 --> 38:28.725
Telephone the police
call box at Union Station.

38:28.759 --> 38:32.663
Tell the constable there to meet
Detective William Murdoch at Don Station.

38:32.697 --> 38:37.467
- Certainly, sir.
- Thank you.

38:37.502 --> 38:39.736
- To Don Station please.
- I'm not finished yet...

38:39.770 --> 38:42.772
- We have no time.
- All right.

38:51.215 --> 38:54.750
Whoa. I'm afraid we're at

38:54.784 --> 38:56.885
an impasse until this clears up.

39:13.136 --> 39:16.004
Get-up!

39:17.573 --> 39:21.243
- Whoa...
- All aboard!

39:21.277 --> 39:24.012
Train departing in 2 minutes!

39:26.315 --> 39:28.283
Mrs. Thompson?

39:28.317 --> 39:31.253
What is the matter?

39:31.287 --> 39:33.321
Dr. Ogden, what are you doing here?

39:33.356 --> 39:35.757
We're looking for your husband.

39:35.791 --> 39:38.993
- My husband is dead.
- The man you identified

39:39.027 --> 39:41.396
as your dead husband
was Alexander Wainwright.

39:41.430 --> 39:47.434
- That's absurd.
- I think audacious is a better word.

39:47.469 --> 39:49.436
You have no proof.

39:49.471 --> 39:52.173
- Not yet.
- I got your message, Murdoch.

39:52.207 --> 39:54.809
- What's going on?
- Have you searched the train?

39:54.843 --> 39:58.880
Lads have been through it,
sir. There's no sign of him.

39:58.914 --> 40:01.948
All aboard for Cobourg,
Kingston, and points beyond.

40:01.983 --> 40:03.950
Well, unless you have some evidence

40:03.985 --> 40:06.987
to back up this ridiculous
theory, I've got a train to catch.

40:09.824 --> 40:14.361
George, search this trunk.

40:14.396 --> 40:17.964
Mrs. Thompson, your train.

40:27.208 --> 40:30.543
- Percy!
- Mary! Mary!

40:30.577 --> 40:32.545
I'm sorry.

40:32.579 --> 40:37.317
- George...
- Oh, my love!

40:37.351 --> 40:39.619
Oh, that's enough, Crabtree. Break 'em up.

40:39.653 --> 40:41.854
- All right, that's enough.
- No, Percy...

40:41.888 --> 40:45.958
- No, please no!
- Mary! Mary...

40:45.992 --> 40:49.061
Bloody Hell.

40:49.095 --> 40:52.231
- Sir?
- Margaret. The reception!

40:52.265 --> 40:55.801
Well, at least they
were true to their vows.

40:55.836 --> 40:57.837
'Til death do them part.

41:03.595 --> 41:06.374
Excuse me. Can you do one more song,
the Wedding Waltz in one minute?

41:06.382 --> 41:07.150
Thank you.

41:12.005 --> 41:13.973
The scotch is at the bar.

41:14.007 --> 41:15.975
I assume that's why you came back.

41:16.009 --> 41:17.977
The job comes first,
Margaret. You know that.

41:18.011 --> 41:21.013
All I know is that my perfect wedding

41:21.047 --> 41:24.049
turned into a perfect disaster.

41:24.084 --> 41:27.219
As long as the marriage is
perfect, what does it matter?

41:27.254 --> 41:30.856
A "perfect marriage"?
There's no such thing.

41:33.493 --> 41:35.727
Why are they playing the Wedding Waltz?

41:35.762 --> 41:39.064
Apparently, I missed the first one.

41:39.099 --> 41:42.467
Mrs. Brackenreid, would you care to dance?

41:42.502 --> 41:45.804
Oh, Thomas!

41:48.274 --> 41:51.810
Here they come! Congratulations!

41:51.844 --> 41:55.380
- They came back!
- Of course they did.

41:59.618 --> 42:02.553
- Shall we?
- It is our dance, after all.

42:02.587 --> 42:04.588
Indeed.

42:13.299 --> 42:16.366
So, are you giving your toast to the groom?

42:16.401 --> 42:19.303
I fear the moment has passed now.

42:19.337 --> 42:21.472
- Would you like to hear it?
- Certainly.

42:23.642 --> 42:26.610
"To Detective Murdoch.
May he always be as happy

42:26.645 --> 42:29.780
as he looks today.

42:29.815 --> 42:33.817
- Is that it?
- Do you have anything to add?

42:33.851 --> 42:37.354
No. I believe that says it all.

42:41.392 --> 42:45.395
- My hair must look a fright.
- No!

42:45.430 --> 42:48.230
You've never looked lovelier.

42:48.265 --> 42:51.334
I think this has been
the perfect wedding day.

42:51.368 --> 42:53.703
With one exception.

42:53.737 --> 42:56.739
I have yet to kiss the bride.

43:18.400 --> 43:20.048
_

43:21.241 --> 43:22.430
All new Murdoch.

43:24.117 --> 43:25.116
Woman driving an automobile?

43:25.118 --> 43:26.667
I think they're dangerous enough already,

43:26.683 --> 43:27.560
thank you very much.

43:27.565 --> 43:28.589
Automobiles are women.

43:28.788 --> 43:30.089
Mr. President! No!

43:31.691 --> 43:32.324
President Roosevelt!

43:32.326 --> 43:35.226

Monday at 8:00 on CBC.
