WEBVTT

00:01.920 --> 00:05.010
ATOR: The mass destruction
of an ancient culture.

00:05.130 --> 00:08.430
JONATHAN YOUNG:
Their art, their philosophy,

00:08.550 --> 00:11.510
their scientific findings...
He burned the whole thing.

00:11.640 --> 00:14.890
NARRATOR: Lost texts that
could have offered evidence

00:15.020 --> 00:19.690
of extraterrestrial contact
from across the globe.

00:19.810 --> 00:22.320
DAVID CHILDRESS:
Literally, people were coming

00:22.440 --> 00:25.440
from all over the world
to Mexico at this time.

00:27.240 --> 00:28.410
PRAVEEN MOHAN:
Here we are in the middle

00:28.530 --> 00:31.120
of South America
in a remote site

00:31.240 --> 00:33.870
that looks exactly like
Hindu carvings.

00:33.990 --> 00:36.330
- How is that possible?
- It's amazing.

00:36.460 --> 00:39.500
NARRATOR: Could the Vatican
still be hiding proof

00:39.630 --> 00:43.590
of mankind's ancient alien
origins?

00:43.710 --> 00:45.460
GIORGIO TSOUKALOS:
I predict thousands

00:45.590 --> 00:48.720
as-of-yet undiscovered sites

00:48.840 --> 00:52.760
will finally show
that our ancestors

00:52.890 --> 00:55.810
made contact
with extraterrestrials.

00:58.730 --> 01:00.850
NARRATOR:
There is a doorway

01:00.980 --> 01:03.730
in the universe.

01:03.860 --> 01:06.650
Beyond it is
the promise of truth.

01:08.030 --> 01:10.410
It demands
we question everything

01:10.530 --> 01:12.740
we have ever been taught.

01:12.870 --> 01:16.500
The evidence is all around us.

01:16.620 --> 01:20.500
The future is
right before our eyes.

01:20.620 --> 01:23.210
We are not alone.

01:23.340 --> 01:26.340
We have never <i>been</i> alone.

01:36.430 --> 01:39.310
NARRATOR:
The Yucatán Peninsula.

01:39.440 --> 01:42.730
1549.

01:42.860 --> 01:45.270
A fleet
of Spanish galleons arrive

01:45.400 --> 01:48.190
on the coast of the New World.

01:48.320 --> 01:52.410
And with them is a small army
of Roman Catholic priests,

01:52.530 --> 01:55.030
who, during what is the height
of the Inquisition,

01:55.160 --> 01:57.750
are determined to rescue
the pagan souls

01:57.870 --> 02:00.250
of the natives for Almighty God.

02:00.370 --> 02:03.420
And leading them...
Direct from the Vatican...

02:03.540 --> 02:07.880
Is the fanatical Franciscan
friar Diego de Landa.

02:09.919 --> 02:11.680
During the Spanish
colonial period

02:11.800 --> 02:13.800
in what we call Mexico Yucatán,

02:13.930 --> 02:15.760
the cradle of Mayan
civilization,

02:15.890 --> 02:18.890
it was the priests who had a lot
of power because the Vatican

02:19.020 --> 02:21.190
was one of the most powerful
nations on the Earth.

02:21.310 --> 02:23.230
JASON MARTELL:
Diego de Landa came over

02:23.350 --> 02:25.480
wanting to teach
Christian understandings

02:25.610 --> 02:27.650
and principles to the Mayans,

02:27.780 --> 02:31.200
but was probably intimidated
by the vast wealth of knowledge

02:31.320 --> 02:33.990
that he actually saw
that they had tapped into.

02:34.110 --> 02:39.200
NARRATOR: The Mayan civilization
that Friar Diego de Landa came upon

02:39.330 --> 02:41.580
had thrived
in the rain-drenched jungles

02:41.710 --> 02:43.750
and fertile plains
of Central America

02:43.870 --> 02:46.840
for more than 2,000 years.

02:46.960 --> 02:50.550
ERICH VON DANIKEN: The Spanish
conquerors found pyramids,

02:50.670 --> 02:53.680
they found temples,
they found paved roads

02:53.800 --> 02:57.930
and they found thousands and
thousands of Maya handwritings,

02:58.060 --> 02:59.930
thousands of it.

03:00.060 --> 03:02.480
MARTELL: We have a lot of
very interesting information

03:02.600 --> 03:05.940
that comes out of this culture
we call the Maya.

03:06.060 --> 03:08.650
They have been revered for many
things in their knowledge base,

03:08.770 --> 03:13.400
especially around time and
concepts of math and science,

03:13.530 --> 03:17.200
and the movements
of the solar system.

03:17.320 --> 03:21.580
NARRATOR: But while the Maya were
in many ways culturally advanced,

03:21.700 --> 03:25.870
their religious beliefs
were notoriously bloodthirsty.

03:26.000 --> 03:28.670
They believed
in human sacrifice,

03:28.790 --> 03:31.840
and as far as Friar Diego
de Landa was concerned,

03:31.960 --> 03:35.930
did so at the expense
of their eternal souls.

03:36.050 --> 03:38.260
It was a clash of cultures

03:38.390 --> 03:42.430
that would not end well
for the Maya people.

03:42.560 --> 03:45.810
Diego de Landa, later,
when he was back in Spain again,

03:45.940 --> 03:49.480
he wrote down, "We found
thousands of handwritings

03:49.610 --> 03:51.230
"of the Indians.

03:51.360 --> 03:55.280
But they all contained
just a Devil's thing."

03:57.660 --> 04:00.870
YOUNG: A new teaching,
a new religion comes into a place

04:00.990 --> 04:04.580
where there is a very strong
adherence to a body of ideas.

04:04.710 --> 04:06.960
We have a competitive situation.

04:07.080 --> 04:09.790
One maneuver is to destroy

04:09.920 --> 04:12.340
as much evidence of the old way
as you can,

04:12.460 --> 04:14.130
and that will help
reduce its grip.

04:14.260 --> 04:17.180
"It's not sacred anymore,
this is just stuff,

04:17.300 --> 04:19.640
so we can burn it
with impunity."

04:21.560 --> 04:24.600
NARRATOR:
On July 12, 1562,

04:24.730 --> 04:26.480
the Catholic priests,

04:26.600 --> 04:28.980
with the armed assistance
of the Spanish military,

04:29.100 --> 04:32.360
executed what was known
during the Inquisition

04:32.480 --> 04:36.360
as an <i>auto-da-fé,</i>
or "act of faith,"

04:36.490 --> 04:38.860
whereby the Maya population

04:38.990 --> 04:41.280
was forced to declare
their religious conversion

04:41.410 --> 04:45.450
to Christianity
or be put to death.

04:45.580 --> 04:49.580
It was also a day that
reportedly saw the destruction

04:49.710 --> 04:52.210
of all of the Maya
sacred scrolls

04:52.340 --> 04:55.050
and more than
5,000 priceless images,

04:55.170 --> 04:58.930
an entire historical record.

04:59.050 --> 05:01.890
YOUNG: There were thousands
of books called codices,

05:02.010 --> 05:04.260
probably scrolls, burned.

05:04.390 --> 05:08.890
All their art, their philosophy,
their scientific findings,

05:09.020 --> 05:11.610
the accumulative knowledge
of this great civilization,

05:11.730 --> 05:14.940
they burned the whole thing.

05:15.070 --> 05:16.820
NARRATOR: But by burning the
vast knowledge accumulated

05:16.940 --> 05:20.240
by the Maya,
did Friar Diego de Landa

05:20.360 --> 05:23.990
also destroy something of
even greater historical value?

05:24.120 --> 05:27.040
Might he have erased all traces

05:27.160 --> 05:30.830
of the Maya's
extraterrestrial ancestors?

05:30.960 --> 05:34.210
There's very interesting
information told to us

05:34.340 --> 05:36.920
by the Mayan elders
that still exist today.

05:37.050 --> 05:39.880
They speak of a time
that they were led to this land

05:40.010 --> 05:41.590
by the sky people.

05:41.720 --> 05:44.560
Could they be referencing
some type of lost race,

05:44.680 --> 05:48.310
even possibly
extraterrestrial in nature?

05:48.430 --> 05:51.690
They seemed to have knowledge
of math and science,

05:51.810 --> 05:55.400
which we can't explain
how they got this information.

05:55.520 --> 05:57.360
When you ask them,
"How did they gain

05:57.480 --> 05:59.190
all of this
amazing information?"

05:59.320 --> 06:02.320
they always reference, "We
learned it from the sky people."

06:02.450 --> 06:05.620
HUGH NEWMAN: There were
traditions in ancient Mexico

06:05.740 --> 06:09.870
of a great teacher
arriving on the Gulf Coast.

06:10.000 --> 06:11.790
And when he arrived,
he brought with him

06:11.920 --> 06:13.920
the arts of civilization.

06:14.040 --> 06:16.670
We know the tradition
may have originated

06:16.800 --> 06:18.420
with a great civilization

06:18.550 --> 06:21.470
who were around
long before the Maya,

06:21.590 --> 06:23.220
but no one knows
who they really were,

06:23.340 --> 06:24.800
or where they really came from.

06:27.390 --> 06:30.770
NARRATOR:
Tres Zapotes, Mexico,

06:30.890 --> 06:34.100
1938.

06:34.230 --> 06:37.480
Archeologist Matthew Stirling,

06:37.610 --> 06:41.240
chief of the Smithsonian's
Bureau of American Ethnology,

06:41.360 --> 06:44.240
follows up on a report
that had gone unexamined

06:44.360 --> 06:48.790
for more than 70 years,
the discovery by a local farmer

06:48.910 --> 06:52.410
of an ancient
megalithic sculpture.

06:52.540 --> 06:57.090
Stirling's investigation
results in a remarkable find:

06:57.210 --> 07:00.710
A giant stone head
buried in the ground.

07:00.840 --> 07:03.090
It was the first in what,
to date,

07:03.220 --> 07:06.140
has become a total
of 17 such heads,

07:06.260 --> 07:09.140
each weighing
a staggering eight tons,

07:09.260 --> 07:13.190
and all estimated
to be some 3,000 years old.

07:13.310 --> 07:16.400
It is a date which suggests
that the heads were carved

07:16.520 --> 07:18.150
not by the Maya,

07:18.270 --> 07:22.820
but by an even older
civilization, the Olmecs.

07:22.940 --> 07:24.570
STEPHEN JETT:
The Olmecs, uh,

07:24.700 --> 07:27.450
they're often called the mother
culture of Mesoamerica.

07:27.570 --> 07:31.080
They are the first
complex culture

07:31.200 --> 07:35.210
of any size and significance
in that part of the world.

07:35.330 --> 07:38.090
ANDREW COLLINS: The Olmec people
come into existence

07:38.210 --> 07:41.340
probably about 1400 BC

07:41.460 --> 07:46.550
in the Tabasco region
of what is today Mexico.

07:46.680 --> 07:50.510
But then, very suddenly,
you have the rise

07:50.640 --> 07:53.730
of a full-blown society
and civilization.

07:53.850 --> 07:58.360
And the question becomes
"Where did the Olmec come from?"

07:58.480 --> 08:02.190
The controversy is that many of
the beautifully carved statues

08:02.320 --> 08:05.860
and stelae
seemed to show African men.

08:05.990 --> 08:10.830
JETT: They appear to be not
native to the New World,

08:10.950 --> 08:13.660
but are native
to sub-Saharan Africa.

08:13.790 --> 08:16.960
This is not scientific
physical anthropology,

08:17.080 --> 08:20.960
but just the appearance of these
things is pretty suggestive.

08:21.090 --> 08:26.130
NEWMAN: And they also show Chinese,
Vietnamese, possibly Polynesian

08:26.260 --> 08:31.050
and even Caucasian people
carved into solid rock.

08:31.180 --> 08:33.600
So, there's big mystery
about the Olmecs.

08:33.720 --> 08:37.480
CHILDRESS: Where are all
these people coming from?

08:37.600 --> 08:41.020
Early archeologists were
dumbfounded by all of these

08:41.150 --> 08:44.360
different racial characteristics

08:44.480 --> 08:47.990
that we're seeing in the Olmec
figurines and statues.

08:48.110 --> 08:52.030
Literally, people were coming
from all over the world

08:52.160 --> 08:54.660
to Mexico at this time.

08:54.790 --> 08:56.790
And how did they do that?

08:59.040 --> 09:00.750
NARRATOR:
Do the Olmec heads and artifacts

09:00.880 --> 09:03.500
present evidence
that this ancient civilization

09:03.630 --> 09:06.920
had its genetic origins
not in South America,

09:07.050 --> 09:09.800
as many mainstream
archaeologists believe,

09:09.930 --> 09:14.260
but thousands of miles away, and
on the other side of the Earth?

09:14.390 --> 09:15.810
But how?

09:15.930 --> 09:18.480
Ancient astronaut theorists
suggest

09:18.600 --> 09:21.100
the answer may be found
after a careful examination

09:21.230 --> 09:24.190
of a number
of extraordinary Olmec artifacts

09:24.320 --> 09:27.070
found in La Venta, Mexico.

09:27.190 --> 09:30.780
TSOUKALOS:
In La Venta, we have carvings

09:30.910 --> 09:35.120
that show the Olmecs
in very bizarre scenes.

09:36.580 --> 09:40.040
One of them
is this plumed serpent,

09:40.170 --> 09:43.340
this snake that appears
to be floating in the sky,

09:43.460 --> 09:46.590
and then down below,
you actually see a person

09:46.710 --> 09:51.130
sitting inside
this flying snake.

09:51.260 --> 09:55.220
And so you have to wonder
if somehow the Olmecs

09:55.350 --> 09:58.480
had access
to aviation technology,

09:58.600 --> 10:01.350
and I personally think they did,

10:01.480 --> 10:05.820
because at the Museum of Natural
History in New York City,

10:05.940 --> 10:08.530
there is a Olmec figurine.

10:08.650 --> 10:11.990
He is clearly wearing
some type of a pressurized suit.

10:12.110 --> 10:16.080
He has some type of controls
with tubes on his chest.

10:16.200 --> 10:19.500
On the side, you have six wings
coming out of him.

10:19.620 --> 10:23.540
In my opinion, it is
the smoking gun of our ancestors

10:23.670 --> 10:26.590
having access
to aviation technology

10:26.710 --> 10:28.510
thousands of years ago.

10:30.880 --> 10:34.090
NARRATOR: Is it possible that
the ancestors of the Olmec people

10:34.220 --> 10:38.310
had come to South America
from far across the ocean?

10:38.430 --> 10:41.100
Ancient astronaut theorists
say yes,

10:41.230 --> 10:43.440
and believe the way
they got there

10:43.560 --> 10:47.360
may not have been in ships,
but across the skies,

10:47.480 --> 10:50.860
in extraterrestrially-designed
spacecraft.

10:56.740 --> 10:59.540
NARRATOR:
San Agustín, Colombia.

11:00.700 --> 11:04.710
March 27, 2019.

11:04.830 --> 11:08.420
Ancient astronaut theorist
David Childress

11:08.550 --> 11:10.590
has come to this
remote mountain town

11:10.710 --> 11:13.340
to explore and study a site
that has baffled

11:13.470 --> 11:16.550
the scientific community
for decades.

11:18.760 --> 11:21.310
Joining him is Hindu historian

11:21.430 --> 11:22.890
Praveen Mohan.

11:23.020 --> 11:25.190
- CHILDRESS: Hello, Praveen.
- Hi, David.

11:25.310 --> 11:27.190
- Welcome to Colombia.
- I know.

11:27.310 --> 11:28.940
- CHILDRESS: Jump on in here.
- Sure.

11:30.820 --> 11:32.740
CHILDRESS:
You know, Praveen,

11:32.860 --> 11:34.570
I was here
a number of years ago.

11:34.700 --> 11:37.370
And I thought,
"All right, there's a lot

11:37.490 --> 11:39.030
of Hindu influence here."

11:39.160 --> 11:42.120
And, so, that's when I thought
that I need some expert

11:42.250 --> 11:45.500
on Hinduism, like you,
to come here to San Agustín

11:45.620 --> 11:47.380
and-and see it for themselves.

11:47.500 --> 11:48.710
Yeah, when I got the call

11:48.840 --> 11:51.420
about a place like this
in Colombia,

11:51.550 --> 11:52.670
I was surprised.

11:52.800 --> 11:56.180
A Hindu site in South America?

11:56.300 --> 11:57.890
My heart is actually pounding

11:58.010 --> 11:59.850
- to see the site.
- (chuckles)

12:02.180 --> 12:04.680
NARRATOR: Located deep
within the Andean foothills

12:04.810 --> 12:06.600
of southern Colombia,

12:06.730 --> 12:09.900
the San Agustín
Archaeological Park is home

12:10.020 --> 12:12.320
to more than 500
megalithic stone statues

12:12.440 --> 12:13.940
of unknown origin.

12:14.070 --> 12:16.530
First discovered
by a Spanish monk

12:16.660 --> 12:18.660
in the mid-18th century,

12:18.780 --> 12:20.120
they appear to be the work

12:20.240 --> 12:23.160
of the region's
earliest civilizations

12:23.290 --> 12:27.080
and are thought to date back
as many as 2,000 years.

12:30.380 --> 12:32.210
So, this is the main gate here.

12:32.340 --> 12:36.130
We've got a bit of a walk
through the jungle.

12:36.260 --> 12:40.100
And this is a very remote spot,
even today.

12:40.220 --> 12:42.310
So high in the mountains.

12:42.430 --> 12:45.270
You wonder how people got
to this site,

12:45.390 --> 12:48.400
why they would have
even chosen this.

12:48.520 --> 12:50.770
- Here it is.
- Wow.

12:50.900 --> 12:52.820
- Check it out.
- Yeah, let's see.

12:54.030 --> 12:55.650
NARRATOR:
David Childress

12:55.780 --> 12:58.820
has been researching this area
for many years.

12:58.950 --> 13:01.700
He is convinced
that many of the statues

13:01.830 --> 13:03.030
show strong connections

13:03.160 --> 13:04.700
to the Olmec statues

13:04.830 --> 13:07.120
that were first discovered
in Mexico

13:07.250 --> 13:09.830
more than 1,600 miles
to the north

13:09.960 --> 13:12.340
in the 1800s.

13:13.590 --> 13:15.210
CHILDRESS:
We know that the Olmecs

13:15.340 --> 13:18.550
were in Mexico
and also in Central America,

13:18.680 --> 13:21.760
but evidence of the Olmecs
in South America

13:21.890 --> 13:24.350
has been elusive until now.

13:24.470 --> 13:27.850
Here at San Agustín,
we have that evidence.

13:27.980 --> 13:31.270
This would be one
of the earliest Olmec sites

13:31.400 --> 13:32.770
because it's thought

13:32.900 --> 13:34.730
that San Agustín started

13:34.860 --> 13:37.650
as early as 3000 BC,

13:37.780 --> 13:40.570
and other Olmec sites in Mexico

13:40.700 --> 13:44.530
are only dated
to around 1000 BC,

13:44.660 --> 13:47.330
so this is
an extremely important site.

13:47.450 --> 13:49.330
What I really wanted
to show you is,

13:49.460 --> 13:51.670
what I think is Hindu things,

13:51.790 --> 13:53.920
- which are right over here.
- Okay.

13:54.040 --> 13:56.670
- Wow!
- NARRATOR: It is David Childress' belief

13:56.800 --> 13:58.380
that the stone sculptures

13:58.510 --> 14:00.510
of the San Agustín
Archaeological Park

14:00.630 --> 14:03.010
not only show
strong similarities

14:03.140 --> 14:05.720
to the Olmec carvings
found in Mexico,

14:05.850 --> 14:08.640
but also show
even more profound connections

14:08.770 --> 14:11.440
to Hindu carvings
and artwork found in India

14:11.560 --> 14:13.190
and Southeast Asia.

14:13.310 --> 14:15.690
I think you'll be
interested in this.

14:15.820 --> 14:20.320
MOHAN: Oh, a figure holding a
skull flanked by two other figures.

14:20.450 --> 14:22.070
That is so Hindu.

14:22.200 --> 14:26.990
And these two doorkeepers...

14:27.120 --> 14:31.120
see how they're holding weapons
to protect the main deity?

14:31.250 --> 14:35.040
We can see a central deity
holding a skull.

14:37.210 --> 14:42.880
And two guardian doorkeepers
holding tools.

14:43.010 --> 14:47.310
This is typical
South Indian architecture.

14:47.430 --> 14:53.020
This is exactly what's portrayed
in these temples.

14:53.140 --> 14:57.440
This is amazing because I've
never seen anything like this

14:57.570 --> 15:00.570
in South America.

15:00.690 --> 15:03.360
What's really interesting to me,

15:03.490 --> 15:07.030
is that the main deity
is shown with fangs.

15:07.160 --> 15:11.000
That's typical of South India;

15:11.120 --> 15:15.580
In Tamil Nadu,
Shiva is shown with fangs.

15:15.710 --> 15:17.000
CHILDRESS:
You think that's maybe Shiva,

15:17.130 --> 15:19.500
- right there in the middle?
- MOHAN: Yes.

15:19.630 --> 15:23.010
NARRATOR: Shiva?
Also known as "The Destroyer"?

15:23.130 --> 15:27.180
Is it possible that evidence
of this uniquely Hindu deity

15:27.300 --> 15:30.140
has been found
in South America...

15:30.270 --> 15:32.230
and on ancient megalithic
stone carvings

15:32.350 --> 15:34.940
dating back some 2,000 years?

15:36.940 --> 15:38.690
So how bout these
right here, huh?

15:38.820 --> 15:40.730
Wow, yeah,
these are, uh, lingams.

15:40.860 --> 15:43.190
These are symbols of Shiva.

15:43.320 --> 15:46.570
And we can see these lingams
have more and more

15:46.700 --> 15:49.120
details on them.

15:49.240 --> 15:53.200
And look... here
it even has a face.

15:53.330 --> 15:55.120
- CHILDRESS: Yeah, how bout that?
- MOHAN: You see this...

15:55.250 --> 15:58.290
is a classic mukhalingam.

15:58.420 --> 16:03.010
It is a lingam
with a face on top.

16:03.130 --> 16:04.720
- A mukhalingam?
- Yeah.

16:04.840 --> 16:07.590
The word <i>mukha</i> means face,
and the lingam means

16:07.720 --> 16:09.010
a cylindrical structure.

16:09.140 --> 16:13.220
And this is
classic Hindu iconography,

16:13.350 --> 16:17.310
and you can see this
in many ancient temples.

16:18.940 --> 16:21.150
So here, have a look
at this one here.

16:21.270 --> 16:22.820
I think you'll find this
pretty interesting.

16:22.940 --> 16:24.190
Wow!

16:24.320 --> 16:28.490
An eagle holding a snake
in its beaks,

16:28.620 --> 16:31.990
and then it's also
holding the snake

16:32.120 --> 16:33.370
on its talons.
I mean, this is

16:33.490 --> 16:35.660
classic Hindu iconography.

16:35.790 --> 16:39.080
This is Garuda holding the Naga.

16:39.210 --> 16:42.550
So Garuda is always depicted
as a giant bird,

16:42.670 --> 16:44.210
and then typically,
he's holding a snake...

16:44.340 --> 16:46.630
- Yeah.
- In his beak and his talons.

16:46.760 --> 16:50.510
I've seen something very similar
to this in Vietnam,

16:50.640 --> 16:51.890
in a place called Champa.

16:52.010 --> 16:54.930
I can show you
a picture of this.

16:57.140 --> 17:00.190
CHILDRESS: So the snake that he's
holding in his beak and talons

17:00.310 --> 17:02.730
- is a Naga snake, is that right?
- Yes. Yes.

17:02.860 --> 17:07.150
In Hindu text, we don't see
the Garuda as an animal

17:07.280 --> 17:09.109
or the snake as an animal.

17:09.240 --> 17:13.740
There are two different races;
One is the Garuda,

17:13.869 --> 17:18.710
which actually comes from
a planet up above the sky.

17:18.829 --> 17:23.960
The Nagas are reptilian,
snake-like shape-shifting beings

17:24.089 --> 17:25.589
which live underground.

17:27.970 --> 17:30.340
CHILDRESS: Now that's an interesting
story, because that's

17:30.470 --> 17:32.640
on the flag of Mexico today.

17:32.760 --> 17:34.220
- MOHAN: Oh, really?
- Yeah, how bout that?

17:34.350 --> 17:36.720
MOHAN:
Oh, wow, wow!

17:36.850 --> 17:40.060
CHILDRESS: So the Garuda is in
some ways a symbol of the airships,

17:40.190 --> 17:41.810
- the spaceships...
- Absolutely.

17:41.940 --> 17:43.730
- And the flight that they would use.
- Yes.

17:43.860 --> 17:47.150
Here we are in the middle
of South America,

17:47.280 --> 17:51.820
in a remote site that looks
exactly like Hindu carvings.

17:51.950 --> 17:55.410
I mean, without any connection,
how is that possible?

17:55.540 --> 17:56.830
Well, do you think, then,

17:56.950 --> 17:59.790
that these Hindu demigods

17:59.910 --> 18:02.670
are, are flying
in-in spaceships,

18:02.790 --> 18:05.210
even scouting, they're
creating a place like this?

18:05.340 --> 18:08.880
It's all so strange, but it's,
it's so obvious that

18:09.010 --> 18:13.260
some kind of high, technical
civilization was here.

18:13.390 --> 18:16.350
- Yes. Mm-hmm.
- It's... it's amazing.

18:18.100 --> 18:20.310
NARRATOR:
Ancient Hindus?

18:20.440 --> 18:24.440
Traveling across the Pacific
Ocean in flying aircraft?

18:24.560 --> 18:26.150
But even if
such an incredible feat

18:26.270 --> 18:29.070
was possible...
where is the evidence?

18:29.190 --> 18:33.490
As far as ancient astronaut
theorists are concerned,

18:33.610 --> 18:37.240
the evidence not only exists,
but has been tested.

18:37.370 --> 18:41.710
And it confirms the likelihood
that extraterrestrial visitors

18:41.830 --> 18:45.670
came here to Earth
thousands of years ago.

18:51.800 --> 18:53.630
NARRATOR: At the San Agustín
In Archaeological Park

18:53.760 --> 18:56.050
in Colombia, South America,

18:56.180 --> 18:59.180
ancient astronaut theorist
David Childress

18:59.310 --> 19:01.680
and Hindu expert Praveen Mohan

19:01.810 --> 19:04.690
are investigating
what they believe to be

19:04.810 --> 19:07.770
conclusive evidence
that Hindu explorers

19:07.900 --> 19:11.490
migrated to this area
more than 2,000 years ago.

19:11.610 --> 19:15.200
So here, have a look
at this dolmen here.

19:16.990 --> 19:19.540
- What do you see?
- Wow, there's a, uh,

19:19.660 --> 19:23.920
central deity
flanked by two doorkeepers.

19:24.040 --> 19:27.880
But these doorkeepers
are not human or even humanoid.

19:28.000 --> 19:31.090
You can see the scales
on the body,

19:31.210 --> 19:32.550
you know, see the lines.

19:32.670 --> 19:34.380
And what's
even more interesting...

19:34.510 --> 19:36.640
I mean, it seems almost like
they have a hood

19:36.760 --> 19:38.430
on top of them,

19:38.550 --> 19:40.430
which is characteristic
of cobras,

19:40.560 --> 19:43.850
and cobras don't exist
in Americas.

19:43.980 --> 19:46.020
How did this motif get here?

19:46.150 --> 19:47.560
And believe it or not,

19:47.690 --> 19:51.230
we still have
this same depiction

19:51.360 --> 19:53.400
in many
Southeast Asian countries.

19:53.530 --> 19:55.110
In fact, I have pictures of it.

19:55.240 --> 19:56.660
- CHILDRESS: Right.
- MOHAN: Yeah, this is a temple.

19:56.780 --> 19:58.450
This is in Thailand.

19:58.570 --> 20:03.700
You can see that this is being
guarded by two Nagas.

20:03.830 --> 20:05.870
CHILDRESS: I see that,
and they have their ribs, uh,

20:06.000 --> 20:07.460
on their stomach,
just like this.

20:07.580 --> 20:08.880
MOHAN: Yeah,
the-the scales on the bodies.

20:09.000 --> 20:10.290
CHILDRESS:
Yeah, that's fascinating.

20:12.170 --> 20:13.590
MOHAN:
And you know, there's yet

20:13.710 --> 20:15.340
another characteristic feature

20:15.470 --> 20:16.880
that you would really love.

20:17.010 --> 20:21.810
These are feathered serpents
like Kukulkan.

20:21.930 --> 20:23.720
CHILDRESS: The feathered serpent of Kukulkan?
- Yes.

20:23.850 --> 20:25.350
MOHAN:
And flanking on the pyramid.

20:25.480 --> 20:27.690
NARRATOR:
Kukulkan?

20:27.810 --> 20:30.770
The Mayan god
that is most famously depicted

20:30.900 --> 20:33.650
on the temple of El Castillo
in Chichen Itza?

20:33.780 --> 20:36.240
The one described
as a feathered serpent

20:36.360 --> 20:39.490
that descended to Earth
from the sky?

20:39.620 --> 20:42.450
But as far as
many ancient astronaut theorists

20:42.580 --> 20:45.460
are concerned, depictions
of the god Kukulkan

20:45.580 --> 20:48.620
are not merely depictions
of a flying serpent,

20:48.750 --> 20:51.540
as many mainstream
archaeologists believe,

20:51.670 --> 20:53.500
but of a spaceman.

20:53.630 --> 20:57.970
And they cite
the presence of a humanoid face,

20:58.090 --> 21:00.470
often seen emerging
from the mouth of the serpent,

21:00.600 --> 21:03.310
as really a depiction
of a helmeted astronaut

21:03.430 --> 21:06.020
piloting a large,
flying spacecraft,

21:06.140 --> 21:08.690
similar to what is known
as a "vimana"

21:08.810 --> 21:11.060
in the Hindu tradition.

21:13.610 --> 21:16.740
In the Mahbharata, we can see

21:16.860 --> 21:21.740
very advanced flying machines,
which are called vimanas.

21:21.870 --> 21:24.370
It is clearly established

21:24.490 --> 21:28.750
that the gods come down
from the sky using vimanas.

21:28.870 --> 21:32.210
It is also talked about

21:32.340 --> 21:35.550
in Mayan culture.

21:35.670 --> 21:37.880
There are several types
of vimanas that

21:38.010 --> 21:39.930
- you yourself have published.
- Uh-huh.

21:40.050 --> 21:43.600
And there is a type of vimana
which has tail fins, correct?

21:43.720 --> 21:45.010
Yeah, the Chicuna vimana

21:45.140 --> 21:46.810
- has wings...
- Yeah, yeah.

21:46.930 --> 21:49.020
While other vimanas were discoid

21:49.140 --> 21:50.770
and other vimanas were,
like, tubular,

21:50.900 --> 21:54.400
- cigar-shaped ships.
- Yes, yeah.

21:54.520 --> 21:56.860
And what's really
fascinating is that,

21:56.980 --> 21:59.990
in the Gold Museum in Bogotá,

22:00.110 --> 22:03.530
we have the same vimanas
made of gold,

22:03.660 --> 22:05.950
- correct? These discoid...
- We have the-the gold airplanes there.

22:06.080 --> 22:08.700
NARRATOR:
In the early 1900s,

22:08.830 --> 22:11.040
tomb robbers came upon
a grave site

22:11.170 --> 22:12.880
along Colombia's Magdalena River

22:13.000 --> 22:16.420
dating back an estimated
1,500 years.

22:16.550 --> 22:21.180
Inside, they discovered hundreds
of small gold figurines.

22:21.300 --> 22:26.760
TSOUKALOS: Hundreds of these small,
gold objects have been found,

22:26.890 --> 22:29.930
many of which are rooted
in the animal kingdom.

22:30.060 --> 22:35.520
17 eerily look like
modern-day airplanes.

22:35.650 --> 22:37.900
The wings are attached
at the bottom.

22:38.030 --> 22:40.740
Birds, they have
their wings attached

22:40.860 --> 22:43.740
where we have our shoulders,
like this.

22:43.860 --> 22:47.740
So no formation in the
animal kingdom exists

22:47.870 --> 22:50.710
in the form of these
Quimbaya artifacts.

22:50.830 --> 22:55.750
And, in 1996, two engineers

22:55.880 --> 22:58.960
took a couple of these
ancient artifacts,

22:59.090 --> 23:01.470
blew them up to this size,

23:01.590 --> 23:04.800
put a propeller inside,
threw it up in the air,

23:04.930 --> 23:07.010
and it flew.

23:10.520 --> 23:13.270
NARRATOR: Is it possible that
among the Quimbaya figurines

23:13.390 --> 23:14.770
found in Colombia

23:14.900 --> 23:17.650
are representations of what
the Hindu people

23:17.770 --> 23:20.860
on the other side of the world
described as vimanas?

23:20.990 --> 23:25.990
Ancient astronaut theorists
suggest the answer can be found

23:26.120 --> 23:29.660
by examining a character
from the ancient Hindu texts:

23:29.790 --> 23:34.500
A character who bears
the name "Maya."

23:34.620 --> 23:37.920
The word "Maya" itself
is a Hindu word.

23:38.040 --> 23:41.170
It means "illusion"
or "god of illusion."

23:41.300 --> 23:46.180
And this was the name
given to the king of Asuras,

23:46.300 --> 23:49.680
and he's known as Maya
because he's able to create

23:49.810 --> 23:52.020
these magical illusions.

23:52.140 --> 23:57.650
DEEPAK SHIMKHADA: Maya,
he was born of divine god Brahma.

23:57.770 --> 24:02.030
He was a great architect,
he was a great magician,

24:02.150 --> 24:05.820
and he invented
the flying machine.

24:05.950 --> 24:08.370
He was not of the Earth because

24:08.490 --> 24:11.040
he was not born on Earth,

24:11.160 --> 24:14.540
so he was obviously
extraterrestrial.

24:14.660 --> 24:18.500
MOHAN: Maya actually
traveled out of India,

24:18.630 --> 24:20.460
and he might've gone to Mexico.

24:20.590 --> 24:22.550
Now, interestingly,

24:22.670 --> 24:25.840
Mayans have a book
called <i>Popul Vuh.</i>

24:25.970 --> 24:29.010
In that book,
they talk about how

24:29.140 --> 24:32.810
a specific god
came from the east,

24:32.930 --> 24:35.730
and I think this
is the same god that

24:35.850 --> 24:37.730
both these cultures
are talking about.

24:41.520 --> 24:44.280
NARRATOR: If the divine
King Maya was a real being,

24:44.400 --> 24:47.780
as millions of Hindus believe,
is it possible

24:47.910 --> 24:50.200
that the Mayan civilization
of Central America

24:50.320 --> 24:52.120
adopted his name?

24:52.240 --> 24:56.290
According to ancient astronaut
theorist David Childress,

24:56.410 --> 24:59.630
the answer is a resounding yes,

24:59.750 --> 25:03.250
and he believes that at
San Agustín there is a sculpture

25:03.380 --> 25:05.340
that doesn't only
support his theory,

25:05.460 --> 25:07.380
but may also be a depiction

25:07.510 --> 25:10.050
of an actual alien visitor.

25:10.180 --> 25:11.850
Would you like to see,
perhaps, a spaceman?

25:11.970 --> 25:13.390
- (chuckling): A spaceman?
- Yes.

25:13.510 --> 25:15.140
- There's one more site.
- Yeah, absolutely!

25:23.320 --> 25:26.690
NARRATOR: San Agustín
Archaeological Park in Colombia

25:26.820 --> 25:28.820
is located along the west bank

25:28.950 --> 25:32.200
of the Magdalena River,
near a place where it converges

25:32.320 --> 25:34.660
with two other rivers.

25:34.790 --> 25:38.660
It is a location that ancient
astronaut theorists believe

25:38.790 --> 25:42.630
has a startling and
not accidental significance.

25:42.750 --> 25:44.670
MOHAN: They could've set
up this site anywhere,

25:44.800 --> 25:49.130
but why did they choose
San Agustín in Colombia?

25:49.260 --> 25:52.510
In India, we have this place
called Triveni Sangam

25:52.640 --> 25:55.100
where three great rivers meet,

25:55.220 --> 25:58.810
and that site is chosen
as a sacred site.

25:58.930 --> 26:01.730
We have a lot of temples
in this place.

26:01.850 --> 26:06.900
Whoever came from India to here

26:07.030 --> 26:09.740
chose this place
because this is where

26:09.860 --> 26:12.280
all these three rivers meet.

26:12.410 --> 26:14.700
And to find a place like this,

26:14.830 --> 26:17.500
you needed to have
aerial survey.

26:19.540 --> 26:22.080
They were using the vimanas,
which is why

26:22.210 --> 26:25.170
they set up this ancient
Shiva temple here.

26:25.290 --> 26:28.300
NARRATOR:
Vimanas?

26:28.420 --> 26:30.420
The extraterrestrial
flying machines

26:30.550 --> 26:32.510
that are described
in the Mahabharata,

26:32.640 --> 26:35.260
the ancient Hindu text?

26:35.390 --> 26:37.470
Is it possible
that Hindu explorers

26:37.600 --> 26:40.520
made the journey from India
to South America,

26:40.640 --> 26:44.190
and then settled in this region
centuries ago?

26:44.310 --> 26:46.230
And could they have made
that journey,

26:46.360 --> 26:50.690
a distance of some 12,000 miles,
by means of a vimana?

26:56.580 --> 26:58.660
Ancient astronaut
theorists say yes,

26:58.790 --> 27:00.700
and they believe that the answer

27:00.830 --> 27:02.460
to what compelled them
to come there

27:02.580 --> 27:06.540
can be found by examining
one of the ancient stone statues

27:06.670 --> 27:10.380
located in San Agustín
Archeological Park.

27:13.680 --> 27:18.260
This was the final statue
that I wanted you to look at.

27:18.390 --> 27:20.350
- Pretty curious, huh?
- Yeah.

27:20.470 --> 27:21.930
CHILDRESS:
I-I don't know what to call this

27:22.060 --> 27:24.520
e-except a spaceman.

27:24.650 --> 27:28.150
You can see that he's wearing
some kind of a helmet.

27:28.270 --> 27:29.980
It looks like he has
a visor, he's got

27:30.110 --> 27:32.530
two rectangular eyes
and a rectangular mouth,

27:32.650 --> 27:33.950
he has no nose.

27:34.070 --> 27:35.450
He's holding this,

27:35.570 --> 27:39.160
what they call a-a power staff.

27:39.290 --> 27:41.750
But what's really
fascinating about that is

27:41.870 --> 27:45.370
he's holding that long cylinder,
and, if you look carefully,

27:45.500 --> 27:48.340
it's going even below his feet.

27:48.460 --> 27:50.130
He's using that cylinder

27:50.250 --> 27:53.840
to go into the ground.
Now this is very interesting

27:53.970 --> 27:56.930
because, in Hindu culture,
there's a god

27:57.050 --> 28:01.060
called Swarna Kala Bhairava,
and he's the god of gold,

28:01.180 --> 28:04.140
and he uses a tool called keyla,

28:04.270 --> 28:08.770
and he uses it to go
into the ground and mine gold.

28:08.900 --> 28:11.860
It could be a special probe
that you can put in the ground

28:11.980 --> 28:15.610
and detect gold and minerals,

28:15.740 --> 28:18.990
so perhaps he is
the extraterrestrial

28:19.120 --> 28:22.370
that is guiding them.

28:22.490 --> 28:25.540
He's a spaceman
in a spacesuit with his

28:25.660 --> 28:27.750
gold mining tools.

28:27.880 --> 28:31.670
NARRATOR:
A spaceman mining gold?

28:31.800 --> 28:37.090
In 1976, author and researcher
Zecharia Sitchin

28:37.220 --> 28:39.800
published a book called
<i>The 12th Planet,</i>

28:39.930 --> 28:41.220
in which he translated

28:41.350 --> 28:42.930
and interpreted the writings

28:43.060 --> 28:45.480
of humanity's earliest
known civilization,

28:45.600 --> 28:48.190
the Sumerians.
According to Sitchin,

28:48.310 --> 28:52.360
the beings described
in the texts, the Anunnaki,

28:52.480 --> 28:56.320
were, in fact,
visitors from another planet.

28:56.450 --> 29:00.160
They created humankind as slaves
that could be forced to mine

29:00.280 --> 29:04.540
the gold the Anunnaki needed
to power their spacecraft.

29:04.660 --> 29:06.910
CHILDRESS:
San Agustín is still

29:07.040 --> 29:09.960
a remote mountain area today,

29:10.080 --> 29:12.130
and coming here in ancient times

29:12.250 --> 29:15.050
would've been
extremely difficult,

29:15.170 --> 29:18.010
but this was
a gold-bearing area,

29:18.130 --> 29:21.010
and if you're looking for gold,
this is the place to come.

29:23.310 --> 29:25.560
NARRATOR: Is it possible
that the strange carvings

29:25.680 --> 29:27.350
found in the area can be proof

29:27.480 --> 29:31.150
that Sitchin's
incredible theory is true?

29:31.270 --> 29:33.230
And that an ancient race
of people

29:33.360 --> 29:35.230
traveled from Asia
to South America

29:35.360 --> 29:36.570
in pursuit of a metal

29:36.690 --> 29:38.400
they had been taught to consider

29:38.530 --> 29:41.910
not just essential, but sacred?

29:42.030 --> 29:45.950
When you talk about how
this place was used for gold,

29:46.080 --> 29:49.670
you know, how they were mining
gold as offerings to gods,

29:49.790 --> 29:52.920
that's exactly what Hindus do,
even today.

29:53.040 --> 29:55.630
And Colombia, right here,

29:55.750 --> 29:58.130
in-in this remote spot,
is land of gold.

29:58.260 --> 29:59.970
So much of the gold
in South America

30:00.090 --> 30:01.890
- came from right here.
- Mm-hmm.

30:02.010 --> 30:03.470
So this is what they
were looking for, gold,

30:03.600 --> 30:04.760
and they came here,
and they found it.

30:04.890 --> 30:05.970
They're flying here,

30:06.100 --> 30:06.930
they're creating
a place like this,

30:07.060 --> 30:08.390
they're also sending ships

30:08.520 --> 30:10.310
across the Pacific Ocean.

30:10.440 --> 30:13.520
- They're bringing power tools.
- Mm-hmm.

30:13.650 --> 30:15.770
And when they're not mining,

30:15.900 --> 30:17.690
they're creating these
amazing statues, that...

30:17.820 --> 30:19.610
And there are hundreds of them
all over here.

30:19.740 --> 30:22.740
MOHAN: Your theory
about people and Mayans

30:22.870 --> 30:25.330
moving from South India
and-and coming here

30:25.450 --> 30:26.830
all the way to South America,

30:26.950 --> 30:29.160
this is all tying together.

30:29.290 --> 30:32.330
We have an extraterrestrial god

30:32.460 --> 30:35.750
who comes down
and he mines for gold,

30:35.880 --> 30:38.510
and he builds
an entire civilization.

30:38.630 --> 30:40.050
I think that makes
a lot of sense.

30:40.170 --> 30:43.720
CHILDRESS:
When it comes to San Agustín,

30:43.840 --> 30:47.140
the Spanish did not know
about this ancient site,

30:47.260 --> 30:48.770
and if they had known about it,

30:48.890 --> 30:50.680
they probably
would've destroyed it.

30:50.810 --> 30:54.270
So throughout Colombia
and Mesoamerica,

30:54.400 --> 30:57.980
we have ruins
of ancient civilizations

30:58.110 --> 30:59.940
still undiscovered,

31:00.070 --> 31:02.320
and with the discoveries
at San Agustín

31:02.450 --> 31:05.570
in the last hundred years,
we now have a chance

31:05.700 --> 31:08.490
to rewrite
South American history.

31:08.620 --> 31:11.710
NARRATOR: Do the stone
statues at San Agustín

31:11.830 --> 31:14.500
provide compelling evidence,

31:14.630 --> 31:16.920
not only that there was
interaction between the peoples

31:17.040 --> 31:18.670
of Asia
and those of South America

31:18.800 --> 31:22.840
centuries ago, but also
that this interaction

31:22.970 --> 31:24.890
was made possible as the result

31:25.010 --> 31:28.060
of extraterrestrial
intervention?

31:28.180 --> 31:30.970
Ancient astronaut
theorists say yes,

31:31.100 --> 31:33.560
and they suggest
further proof can be found

31:33.690 --> 31:37.020
locked away in the secret vaults

31:37.150 --> 31:38.980
of the Vatican Library.

31:42.990 --> 31:45.030
NARRATOR:
Southeast Asia.

31:45.160 --> 31:47.280
2000 BC.

31:47.410 --> 31:50.240
An ethnically diverse
civilization

31:50.370 --> 31:52.910
of seafaring explorers emerges

31:53.040 --> 31:55.580
in the area
of modern-day Vietnam.

31:55.710 --> 31:57.630
At roughly the same time

31:57.750 --> 32:00.130
the Olmec appear in Mesoamerica.

32:02.340 --> 32:04.260
The Cham were an Austronesian

32:04.380 --> 32:06.340
and are
an Austronesian-speaking group.

32:06.470 --> 32:10.760
In, uh, central Vietnam,
Austronesian languages include

32:10.890 --> 32:13.100
Polynesian, Indonesian
and so forth.

32:13.230 --> 32:18.400
And they are closely associated
with highly maritime people.

32:18.520 --> 32:21.020
The word "Cham" represents
a race that extended

32:21.150 --> 32:24.110
from Egypt to India
to Southeast Asia.

32:24.240 --> 32:25.780
The ancient Cham were Hindu.

32:25.900 --> 32:29.410
I believe
there was a Cham migration

32:29.530 --> 32:31.410
to South and Central America.

32:31.540 --> 32:33.450
This was ultimately
a partnership

32:33.580 --> 32:36.120
between advanced
human civilizations

32:36.250 --> 32:37.880
and extraterrestrials.

32:38.000 --> 32:40.670
That's why you see
all of the the diversity

32:40.790 --> 32:44.090
in these artifacts
and these giant structures

32:44.210 --> 32:45.720
that defy logic.

32:47.970 --> 32:49.510
NARRATOR:
If the giant Olmec heads

32:49.640 --> 32:52.510
and artifacts
found in Mexico resemble

32:52.640 --> 32:55.060
a community made up
of multiple ethnicities...

32:55.180 --> 32:58.940
Ethnicities that were
not previously believed

32:59.060 --> 33:01.610
to have been present
in Central or South America

33:01.730 --> 33:03.690
until the 15th century...

33:03.820 --> 33:06.450
Then is it possible
that these people

33:06.570 --> 33:09.780
were among a wave of migrants
who traveled to South America

33:09.910 --> 33:12.660
from various parts of Southern
and Southeast Asia

33:12.780 --> 33:16.370
thousands of years ago?

33:16.500 --> 33:17.870
JETT:
It has occurred to me

33:18.000 --> 33:20.920
that the Cham
might conceivably have been

33:21.040 --> 33:23.340
involved as the
sort of middle persons

33:23.460 --> 33:26.420
in maritime transactions

33:26.550 --> 33:29.130
between Southeast Asia
and the New World,

33:29.260 --> 33:32.800
particularly, perhaps,
northwestern South America.

33:32.930 --> 33:34.890
Modern DNA mapping,

33:35.020 --> 33:38.060
what we call, uh,
molecular DNA study,

33:38.190 --> 33:41.060
has been revolutionizing
the understanding

33:41.190 --> 33:43.110
of human migrations
over the globe.

33:44.940 --> 33:46.820
COLLINS:
What this is very clearly

33:46.940 --> 33:48.990
stating again and again

33:49.110 --> 33:52.820
is there was a relationship
between the peoples

33:52.950 --> 33:55.410
of Southern India,

33:55.540 --> 33:59.120
places like Sri Lanka,
Southeast Asia,

33:59.250 --> 34:02.420
Australia, Micronesia,
Melanesia,

34:02.540 --> 34:06.000
through Polynesia
and particularly

34:06.130 --> 34:09.969
into South America
and Mesoamerica.

34:11.639 --> 34:13.260
NARRATOR:
But if hundreds,

34:13.389 --> 34:16.060
perhaps thousands of people
migrated from Southern

34:16.179 --> 34:18.639
and Southeast Asia
to South America,

34:18.770 --> 34:20.310
how did they get there?

34:20.440 --> 34:23.150
Was it by sailing ship?

34:23.270 --> 34:26.360
Or was it by means
of an alien-inspired aircraft

34:26.480 --> 34:28.110
known as vimana,

34:28.239 --> 34:31.739
as many ancient astronaut
theorists believe?

34:31.860 --> 34:34.489
MOHAN:
We hear this story

34:34.620 --> 34:37.790
time and time again
in Mahabharata.

34:37.909 --> 34:40.210
Some vimanas have
these huge wings

34:40.330 --> 34:45.790
and they have, like, a tail fin,
like a modern-day aircraft.

34:45.920 --> 34:48.800
Almost all these machines
were mentioned

34:48.920 --> 34:51.260
5,000 years ago in Mahabharata.

34:53.179 --> 34:54.510
NARRATOR:
But if mass migration

34:54.639 --> 34:56.889
on a large scale
had been taking place

34:57.010 --> 35:01.390
centuries ago and with the help
of extraterrestrial technology,

35:01.520 --> 35:04.060
then why has no evidence
been found

35:04.190 --> 35:06.980
to support
this incredible theory?

35:07.110 --> 35:10.360
As far as ancient astronaut
theorists are concerned,

35:10.490 --> 35:13.030
the answer dates back
to the bloody persecutions

35:13.160 --> 35:16.870
of the Maya by the Spanish
in the 16th century,

35:16.990 --> 35:20.040
and the deliberate destruction
of hundreds of years

35:20.160 --> 35:23.290
of the Maya's written history
by Friar Diego de Landa.

35:23.420 --> 35:27.590
A destruction that many ancient
astronaut theorists suggest

35:27.710 --> 35:30.380
was not as thorough
as we were made to believe.

35:32.470 --> 35:34.260
CHILDRESS:
Catholic Church was trying

35:34.380 --> 35:37.680
to destroy the old religion
and they-they made a big show

35:37.800 --> 35:41.310
of having huge bonfires of books

35:41.430 --> 35:43.520
and destroying them,

35:43.640 --> 35:46.100
but at the same time,
the Catholic Church

35:46.230 --> 35:47.900
was trying
to accumulate knowledge.

35:50.030 --> 35:51.570
TSOUKALOS:
It would also not surprise me

35:51.690 --> 35:56.450
if Diego de Landa
did not burn everything.

35:56.570 --> 36:00.160
And maybe some of these texts

36:00.290 --> 36:03.080
did make it back to the Vatican.

36:03.210 --> 36:06.380
People often say, "Oh, but the
Vatican just destroys stuff."

36:06.500 --> 36:09.420
Actually...
they don't, on the whole.

36:10.630 --> 36:13.970
What they do is they hide it.

36:14.090 --> 36:16.760
What kind of other
organization in the world

36:16.890 --> 36:18.800
is known to have

36:18.930 --> 36:21.600
an archive that's actually
called "the Secret Archive"?

36:21.720 --> 36:25.270
It's quite possible that while,
on the surface,

36:25.390 --> 36:27.980
the Catholic Church was trying
to destroy everything,

36:28.110 --> 36:31.780
this knowledge that
they're gathering in North

36:31.900 --> 36:34.950
and South America
can benefit the Catholic Church

36:35.070 --> 36:36.910
in the future
and that's what they thought.

36:37.030 --> 36:38.740
PICKNETT:
It might molder away,

36:38.870 --> 36:41.790
but at least they have
control of it.

36:41.910 --> 36:44.000
That's the important thing.

36:44.120 --> 36:47.210
The Vatican
is always about control.

36:47.330 --> 36:49.380
Knowledge is power.

36:49.500 --> 36:51.550
The Vatican
has always known this.

36:51.670 --> 36:53.710
The Vatican has always
known secrets

36:53.840 --> 36:56.300
it doesn't want
the average person to know.

36:57.930 --> 36:59.680
NARRATOR:
Did the Catholic Church appear

36:59.800 --> 37:03.100
to destroy the Maya histories
and sacred scrolls

37:03.220 --> 37:04.850
only to have hidden them away
in the Vatican's

37:04.980 --> 37:07.190
notorious secret archive?

37:07.310 --> 37:10.730
As far as ancient astronaut
theorists are concerned,

37:10.860 --> 37:12.820
the answer... is yes.

37:12.940 --> 37:15.280
And the Church's motives
may not have been

37:15.400 --> 37:17.900
to simply steal
valuable ancient knowledge,

37:18.030 --> 37:20.870
but something far more profound.

37:20.990 --> 37:24.160
They believe the real reason
was to hide the proof

37:24.290 --> 37:26.830
that the origins
of the Maya civilization

37:26.960 --> 37:29.960
and those that existed
thousands of years earlier

37:30.080 --> 37:33.210
couldn't only be traced
to other continents,

37:33.340 --> 37:35.170
but to other planets.

37:41.090 --> 37:44.180
NARRATOR:
Giant megalithic stone heads...

37:44.310 --> 37:48.270
figurines of what appear
to be flying craft...

37:48.390 --> 37:50.940
and statues that evoke cultures

37:51.060 --> 37:53.400
found on the other side
of the world.

37:55.110 --> 37:57.030
According to ancient astronaut
theorists,

37:57.150 --> 37:59.990
it is this information
that the Catholic Church

38:00.110 --> 38:02.990
sought to suppress
when they attempted to destroy

38:03.120 --> 38:07.160
all traces of the Maya culture
nearly 500 years ago.

38:07.290 --> 38:09.460
MARTELL:
Now, what's interesting is,

38:09.580 --> 38:11.170
all these great ancient
cultures,

38:11.290 --> 38:13.080
including the Mayan,
seemed to have

38:13.210 --> 38:16.630
knowledge of math and science,
which we can't explain

38:16.760 --> 38:18.550
how they got this information.

38:18.670 --> 38:21.220
When you ask them,
they always tell you

38:21.340 --> 38:23.890
it came from the gods.

38:25.600 --> 38:26.970
NARRATOR:
If the proof existed,

38:27.100 --> 38:29.310
not only
of cross-Pacific migration,

38:29.430 --> 38:32.310
but also extraterrestrial
visitation,

38:32.440 --> 38:34.810
many ancient astronaut
theorists believe

38:34.940 --> 38:37.360
it would have posed
a serious threat

38:37.480 --> 38:39.440
to a Catholic hierarchy
steeped in

38:39.570 --> 38:42.860
the bigotry and intolerance
of the Inquisition.

38:42.990 --> 38:46.580
But if this incredible theory
is true,

38:46.700 --> 38:50.080
what then happened to
the extraterrestrial visitors?

38:50.210 --> 38:54.080
Why did they come here
only to leave or go into hiding?

38:57.130 --> 38:58.420
CHILDRESS:
Because of various

38:58.550 --> 39:01.720
wars going on, cataclysms,

39:01.840 --> 39:05.800
eventually, these civilizations
began to collapse.

39:05.930 --> 39:07.760
As civilizations do.

39:07.890 --> 39:12.310
And what happened in the end
was the, the airships,

39:12.440 --> 39:15.150
they stopped coming.
And then,

39:15.270 --> 39:18.400
the extraterrestrial demigods
pulled their technology back.

39:18.530 --> 39:20.820
So we don't know
what happened there

39:20.940 --> 39:22.280
with the extraterrestrials
and where they went.

39:22.400 --> 39:24.110
And so you have to wonder

39:24.240 --> 39:27.280
if they don't want us
to know that they are here.

39:27.410 --> 39:30.870
The extraterrestrials
may have just decided, "Okay.

39:31.000 --> 39:33.330
"Humans on planet Earth
have, have got

39:33.460 --> 39:34.870
"the seeds of civilization.

39:35.000 --> 39:36.880
"Let's just stand back

39:37.000 --> 39:38.340
and see what they do."

39:40.760 --> 39:43.880
NARRATOR: As far as ancient
astronaut theorists are concerned,

39:44.010 --> 39:47.600
the proof of extraterrestrial
visitation is still out there,

39:47.720 --> 39:51.470
much of it buried beneath
centuries of dirt and rocks.

39:51.600 --> 39:55.100
But every day,
the truth is being revealed.

39:56.560 --> 40:00.320
In February 2018
through March 2019,

40:00.440 --> 40:04.200
archeologists made a number
of incredible discoveries

40:04.320 --> 40:06.870
just in the area
of Mexico alone.

40:06.990 --> 40:10.740
Mayan artifacts were discovered
in Teotihuacan,

40:10.870 --> 40:13.250
a location previously thought
to have been

40:13.370 --> 40:16.120
inhabited only by the Aztecs.

40:16.250 --> 40:20.090
200 more artifacts were found
in a hidden cave

40:20.210 --> 40:23.670
under the Mayan site
of Chichen Itza.

40:23.800 --> 40:26.640
And beneath dense jungles
near Lake Pátzcuaro,

40:26.760 --> 40:29.220
LiDAR scanning
uncovered an ancient city

40:29.350 --> 40:31.180
the size of Manhattan.

40:33.430 --> 40:36.850
TSOUKALOS:
In the early 1990s,

40:36.980 --> 40:39.310
there were these
science fiction stories

40:39.440 --> 40:42.480
that one day we'll be able
to somehow look

40:42.610 --> 40:45.570
underneath the overgrown jungle.

40:45.700 --> 40:49.570
And sure enough, here we are,
20, 25 years later,

40:49.700 --> 40:52.410
and that technology now exists.

40:52.540 --> 40:56.210
Satellites are now able to look

40:56.330 --> 40:59.920
through the soil
into the ground to see

41:00.040 --> 41:01.710
if other structures exist.

41:01.840 --> 41:04.260
And guess what? They do.

41:06.050 --> 41:09.390
We have only now begun a new era

41:09.510 --> 41:13.310
of discovery and I predict
thousands as-of-yet

41:13.430 --> 41:17.270
undiscovered sites will finally

41:17.390 --> 41:19.230
see the light of day.

41:19.350 --> 41:23.020
If you have a puzzle
with a thousand pieces,

41:23.150 --> 41:26.070
in order to see
the final picture,

41:26.190 --> 41:29.860
you don't need to lay down
all 1,000 pieces.

41:29.990 --> 41:34.660
If you lay down 980 pieces,
I guarantee you,

41:34.790 --> 41:36.580
you will see the big picture.

41:38.580 --> 41:41.840
NARRATOR: Is mankind on an
incredible threshold of discovery?

41:41.960 --> 41:45.260
One that will confirm that
extraterrestrial visitation

41:45.380 --> 41:49.510
has occurred all over
the world and for centuries?

41:49.630 --> 41:53.890
Perhaps beneath the ruins of a
newly discovered site in Mexico,

41:54.010 --> 41:57.270
archeologists will uncover
the ultimate evidence

41:57.390 --> 42:00.520
of alien contact

42:00.650 --> 42:03.980
and proof of humanity's
true origins.
