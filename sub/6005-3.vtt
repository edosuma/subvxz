00:31.400 --> 00:34.472
Look at him. Sleeping like a baby.

00:35.360 --> 00:38.955
Not a care in the world. Bless his cotton socks.

00:39.000 --> 00:42.959
He hasn't got any. You took them away
so he wouldn't hang himself.

00:43.000 --> 00:45.560
Still, he must have had quite a tough night.

00:45.600 --> 00:47.397
Even tougher morning.

00:48.240 --> 00:51.437
- Wakey, wakey!
- What are you doing?

00:51.920 --> 00:53.911
(Engines roar)

00:55.200 --> 00:57.395
(American voices on radio)

01:02.200 --> 01:05.078
I want answers, Peter. From you and from him.

01:05.120 --> 01:09.875
- From me?
- <i>Peter? Is that you?</i>

01:09.920 --> 01:13.037
- What answers can I possibly give you?
- About time!

01:13.080 --> 01:17.915
Your brother faked his suicide,
wasted 18 months of police time,

01:17.960 --> 01:19.837
left the country under an assumed name,

01:19.880 --> 01:22.189
used said name to appropriate funds

01:22.240 --> 01:26.119
and then, when he came back,
you conveniently forgot to tell me!

01:26.160 --> 01:28.799
- <i>I knew you'd get me out!</i>
- Never thought I'd say this to you,

01:28.840 --> 01:31.115
but I hope you know a good lawyer.

01:36.040 --> 01:37.837
OK, then.

01:37.880 --> 01:41.156
Decent. Open up.

01:42.720 --> 01:46.156
Peter? Are you there?

01:46.200 --> 01:49.556
<i>Peter? Peter?</i>

01:53.160 --> 01:54.388
Gloria.

01:55.440 --> 01:58.113
Picnic? Just you and me.

01:58.160 --> 02:00.799
(Crockery clatters)

02:00.840 --> 02:03.798
(Jet engines roar)

02:22.520 --> 02:24.590
(Horn blares)

02:29.200 --> 02:31.839
Oi! I know your number!

02:33.280 --> 02:34.713
Help!

02:35.760 --> 02:38.194
Police! Fire! Ambu...

02:38.240 --> 02:40.037
(Booming)

02:42.760 --> 02:45.035
(Radio traffic)

02:47.160 --> 02:50.232
Damn it! I'm under attack! Help!

02:56.200 --> 02:58.794
OK, copy that.

03:37.760 --> 03:39.751
(Bell tolls)

03:45.600 --> 03:47.795
Oh, Peter, we're so behind.

03:47.840 --> 03:50.229
I've got Miss Camilla Constantine
in your office.

03:50.280 --> 03:52.077
Did you get to see Simon?

03:52.120 --> 03:54.315
Only through the peephole of a cell.

03:54.360 --> 03:55.918
And?

03:57.640 --> 04:00.279
He looked small. Very small.

04:03.240 --> 04:04.389
Oh, Gloria. There's a wasp. Get it off me.

04:04.480 --> 04:06.710
Oh, Gloria. There's a wasp. Get it off me.

04:06.760 --> 04:10.070
- Sorry.
- Here. Here.

04:11.200 --> 04:12.792
(Coughing)

04:16.480 --> 04:18.914
Ow! Ahh!

04:18.959 --> 04:20.598
Oh, dear!

04:20.640 --> 04:22.437
I've got something for that.

04:22.480 --> 04:24.789
Now, don't touch it.

04:26.040 --> 04:28.429
- Let it soak in.
- (Groans)

04:28.480 --> 04:31.199
Everything's going wrong today.

04:31.240 --> 04:33.879
- Is there any news on Simon?
- Ssh! Not in here.

04:33.920 --> 04:36.388
(Silence)

04:36.440 --> 04:39.750
- Morning.
ALL: Good morning.

04:44.080 --> 04:49.473
It's my boyfriend.
He's... well, he's not returning my calls.

04:49.520 --> 04:53.115
One minute he was there, the next he was gone.

04:53.160 --> 04:55.151
I don't seem to be able to track him down.

04:55.200 --> 04:57.316
I'm a solicitor, not a private detective.

04:57.360 --> 05:01.478
I am aware of that,
but I don't know where else to turn.

05:01.520 --> 05:04.080
- Well, I'm sorry.
- I'm expecting his baby.

05:04.120 --> 05:06.236
- Oh.
- And I really don't think it's right

05:06.280 --> 05:09.636
that he can just run off and leave me.

05:10.680 --> 05:11.829
Well...

05:12.840 --> 05:15.752
...if he has indeed reneged
on his parental duties,

05:15.800 --> 05:18.360
that's something I'm fast becoming an expert in.

05:18.400 --> 05:21.756
- I suppose this scoundrel has a name?
- (Cries)

05:21.800 --> 05:24.030
Brad... Bradley Johnson.

05:24.080 --> 05:27.755
Captain Bradley Johnson,
of the United States Air Force.

05:27.800 --> 05:29.472
(Door opens)

05:29.520 --> 05:31.351
- It's war!
- Sidney!

05:31.400 --> 05:33.960
No, I'm sorry, they're attacking, Mr Kingdom!

05:34.000 --> 05:38.391
Mr Snell, would you say goodbye to
Miss Constantine on your way out?

05:38.440 --> 05:41.989
Those Yanks have taken a flight path
directly over my house!

05:42.040 --> 05:46.238
- They've nearly shaken my teeth out!
- Please! Another time, Sidney.

05:48.320 --> 05:52.313
Sorry about that.
He gets a bit excited from time to time.

05:53.360 --> 05:55.032
So you'll help, then?

05:55.080 --> 05:58.993
Well, when it comes to taking on
the entire might of the American Air Force,

05:59.040 --> 06:01.349
it would seem that I'm the man for the job.

06:01.400 --> 06:03.118
(Cries)

06:04.720 --> 06:09.635
Hey. Now I don't want to sound preachy
but have you thought of a pushbike?

06:09.680 --> 06:11.955
Only the environment's
getting very angry at us,

06:12.000 --> 06:15.117
and I thought maybe... maybe...

06:16.160 --> 06:18.390
...we could get a tandem.

06:20.000 --> 06:25.870
Sorry. Maybe the speed camera photos
are not just telling you to slow down

06:25.920 --> 06:27.797
but to change your mode of transport.

06:27.840 --> 06:29.273
Wasn't me.

06:29.320 --> 06:31.515
Well, it's your motorbike licence number.

06:31.560 --> 06:33.676
Wasn't riding it.

06:33.720 --> 06:36.598
- So who was?
- I dunno.

06:39.520 --> 06:41.238
I'll chase it up for you.

06:41.280 --> 06:44.955
See if we can't contest
the points and the fine, eh?

06:45.680 --> 06:46.829
After you.

06:52.720 --> 06:56.679
I was gonna take the little one for a walk.
I wondered if you fancied coming.

06:56.720 --> 06:58.551
I would, obviously.

06:58.600 --> 07:00.511
I've just got so much to do.

07:03.240 --> 07:04.434
Sorry.

07:08.560 --> 07:13.111
Ah, here we are.
Freshly fed, changed and winded.

07:13.160 --> 07:15.435
Seems like I really picked the wrong brother.

07:16.640 --> 07:19.871
Mr Kingdom, I want you to divert those jets.

07:19.920 --> 07:23.390
Oh, really? What with? Anti-aircraft fire?
Ground-to-air missiles?

07:23.440 --> 07:26.830
No, use your lawyer's noggin.
That's your best weapon.

07:26.880 --> 07:29.155
(Buzzing)
- Oh, sorry.

07:29.200 --> 07:30.952
It's all right. Look, um...

07:31.000 --> 07:34.470
the council must have granted them
the right to fly over me.

07:34.520 --> 07:37.114
- So you've gotta get 'em to...
(Jet engine roars)

07:37.160 --> 07:40.038
...un-grant the right.
- "Un-grant the right".

07:40.080 --> 07:43.390
That'd make a good protest song, wouldn't it?
(Hums)

07:43.440 --> 07:45.590
At this rate, my home will be reduced to rubble.

07:45.640 --> 07:47.710
Then I'll have to find somewhere else to live,

07:47.760 --> 07:50.752
and with prices being like they are
and all the townies coming in,

07:50.800 --> 07:53.394
I might have to leave
Market Shipborough for good.

07:53.440 --> 07:56.671
- Really?
- Peter.

07:56.720 --> 07:59.029
That... That would be awful, Mr Snell.

07:59.080 --> 08:02.595
- We can't have that, can we?
- No. Thank you.

08:02.640 --> 08:06.269
Peter Kingdom, you're a good man.

08:11.240 --> 08:14.755
A good man?
I don't know what on earth gave him that idea.

08:21.840 --> 08:24.274
- Is that Simon's?
- Yes.

08:24.320 --> 08:26.709
Oof! What's he got in it?

08:32.600 --> 08:34.397
You're starting to worry me, Peter.

08:34.440 --> 08:37.750
I'm starting to worry myself, thanks to Simon.

08:40.960 --> 08:42.916
(Sighs)

08:42.960 --> 08:45.918
- I thought you went to help him?
- Even if I wanted to,

08:45.960 --> 08:47.996
I'm not allowed to represent my own brother.

08:48.040 --> 08:50.838
It contravenes every known legal practice.

08:50.880 --> 08:54.714
It would have been so much easier
if he'd stayed dead.

08:55.920 --> 08:57.831
This is bad.

08:57.880 --> 09:01.759
Market Shipborough is a town
of gossip and counter-gossip,

09:01.800 --> 09:03.756
<i>and some of it sticks for a lifetime.</i>

09:03.800 --> 09:07.679
If word gets round Simon's incarcerated,
no-one will want to be represented by us.

09:07.720 --> 09:09.790
Then all I can say is,

09:09.840 --> 09:11.910
you'd better find a way out of this.

09:11.960 --> 09:16.795
d (French accent) Money makes ze
world go round, ze world...

09:16.840 --> 09:19.274
Oh. No, no, no, no.

09:21.120 --> 09:22.758
(Groans)

09:22.800 --> 09:25.758
Tell him about the money.
Tell him about the money?

09:26.920 --> 09:29.912
No, he'd never understand.

09:30.840 --> 09:33.559
She's really keen on me. Honor.

09:33.600 --> 09:35.591
I mean, I can't blame her. I am a real catch.

09:35.640 --> 09:38.916
Well, so is a squid, but you wouldn't
want one pushing a pram for you.

09:38.960 --> 09:40.916
Trouble is, I think I like this biker.

09:40.960 --> 09:44.919
Good Lord, we are covering the full
spectrum of our sexuality, aren't we?

09:44.960 --> 09:47.679
(Seagull cries)
- Not a big fat hairy bloke.

09:47.720 --> 09:50.951
A woman.
With all the... curves and swerves.

09:51.000 --> 09:52.911
Yes - shall we talk about something else?

09:52.960 --> 09:57.556
- What do you want to talk about?
- Anything but your frantic hormones.

09:57.600 --> 09:59.830
OK. Here's one.

09:59.880 --> 10:01.632
Let's talk about Simon.

10:03.120 --> 10:04.712
Perhaps not that.

10:04.760 --> 10:07.194
- The weather?
- Now that's much better.

10:07.240 --> 10:10.391
As in whether or not
your brother's gonna ruin us.

10:30.280 --> 10:32.271
Morning, sir. Name and business?

10:32.320 --> 10:36.199
- Peter Kingdom. And this is my...
- Lyle Anderson. Sir.

10:36.240 --> 10:37.195
(Buzzing)

10:37.240 --> 10:39.913
We're here to see the Base Commander.

10:39.960 --> 10:41.154
It's on me.

10:41.200 --> 10:43.031
- It's on me!
- Please stand still, sir!

10:43.080 --> 10:45.275
I'm asking you to stand still, sir.

10:45.320 --> 10:47.038
- Kill it!
- Do not go there, sir!

10:47.080 --> 10:49.196
- East Gate, I need backup.
- No.

10:49.240 --> 10:52.949
- We have an intruder. An intruder.
- It's a genuine phobia, I assure you.

10:53.000 --> 10:55.195
- Down! Hands behind your head!
- Steady on!

10:55.240 --> 10:56.992
There's no need for Ow. Ow!

10:57.040 --> 10:59.315
- You're under arrest.
- Oh, thank you, Lyle.

10:59.360 --> 11:01.510
Let's make it a family affair, shall we?

11:01.560 --> 11:03.516
Let's get all the Kingdoms locked up.

11:03.560 --> 11:04.959
Ow, ow!

11:16.000 --> 11:20.198
- Oh. Have I got to share a cell now?
- This is your lawyer.

11:20.240 --> 11:22.071
I have to provide you with one.

11:22.120 --> 11:25.032
And since your brother can't, or won't...

11:25.080 --> 11:27.548
meet Mr Arndale, from Arndale and Calloway.

11:27.600 --> 11:29.750
Are you serious?

11:29.800 --> 11:31.631
Go gentle on him.

11:31.680 --> 11:34.319
He's just come back from
a nervous breakdown.

11:44.000 --> 11:46.468
Next time someone challenges you
on your business,

11:46.520 --> 11:48.636
try giving them a straight answer.

11:48.680 --> 11:50.955
I'm scared of bees.

11:52.840 --> 11:56.071
And what can we do for you?
Other than darning your hole?

11:56.120 --> 11:58.236
Ah, well, two things, really.

11:58.280 --> 12:01.989
Firstly, your jets are flying over a client's house.

12:02.040 --> 12:03.758
Someone has to defend your country.

12:03.800 --> 12:06.519
Yes. From you, it would seem.

12:06.560 --> 12:10.269
Er... but more pressingly, we need
to contact Captain Bradley Johnson.

12:10.320 --> 12:13.357
- Who?
- One of your pilots.

12:13.400 --> 12:16.278
- Bradley Johnson, Captain?
- Never heard of him.

12:18.560 --> 12:23.918
Right, well, thanks... thanks all the same
but if it comes to it, I think I'll er... defend myself.

12:25.840 --> 12:27.717
I need a lion, not a mouse.

12:27.760 --> 12:29.512
There is nobody else.

12:29.560 --> 12:32.074
- There's Peter!
- Where is he, then?

12:41.960 --> 12:43.552
Ow!

12:44.320 --> 12:46.356
Oh, I wish Beatrice were here.

12:46.400 --> 12:48.868
And maybe a bag of explosives.

12:48.920 --> 12:51.275
She'd bust Simon out of jail and then...

12:51.320 --> 12:53.834
(Groans)
...hopefully we'd never see him again.

12:54.880 --> 12:58.668
Don't give up. That's never been your way.

12:58.720 --> 13:01.712
<i>"Cometh the hour, cometh the man."</i>

13:02.680 --> 13:04.079
Right.

13:05.320 --> 13:07.311
I'll show those Americans.

13:17.320 --> 13:21.632
You can't have jets screaming over houses
at seven in the morning.

13:23.640 --> 13:26.552
No. Not even at 0700 hours.

13:28.560 --> 13:31.711
- Can we talk?
- Yeah.

13:32.760 --> 13:34.557
Lyle, what d'you think of me?

13:36.000 --> 13:39.276
I... think you're great. Lovely.

13:41.600 --> 13:44.910
And if I was single and unencumbered
what would you think of me?

13:49.960 --> 13:53.714
- That you were great. Lovely.
- (Sighs) Damn.

13:53.760 --> 13:55.830
You've got Simon.

13:55.880 --> 13:58.872
It's not quite the comforting
thought you might think it to be.

13:58.920 --> 14:02.515
I guess what I'm trying to say is...
Simon might need you.

14:03.520 --> 14:05.511
And I wouldn't want to complicate things.

14:05.560 --> 14:07.869
(Sighs) Why do you have to be so nice?

14:31.200 --> 14:34.192
- Hello again.
- Hello.

14:36.200 --> 14:37.838
Wow!

14:39.960 --> 14:42.554
- Lavender's heavenly at this time of year.
- Mmm.

14:42.600 --> 14:46.673
What a spectacular place you have here.

14:47.720 --> 14:50.917
I don't know how to put this,
but when I went to the air force base,

14:50.960 --> 14:54.157
they told me they don't have
a Captain Bradley Johnson.

14:54.200 --> 14:56.395
- Sorry?
- They'd never heard of him.

14:56.440 --> 14:58.476
Apparently there is no such flight captain.

14:58.520 --> 15:02.115
- He doesn't seem to exist.
- But he does. I've... I've met him.

15:02.160 --> 15:04.913
I've had him in my bed, for goodness' sake!

15:07.000 --> 15:08.479
What is this?

15:09.080 --> 15:13.153
Perhaps you can tell me a little more
about your relationship with this man?

15:13.200 --> 15:17.079
- As in?
- Uh... when did he disappear exactly?

15:17.120 --> 15:19.634
Practically the moment
I told him I was pregnant.

15:19.680 --> 15:21.671
And how long had you been together?

15:21.720 --> 15:24.075
About three months by then.

15:24.120 --> 15:26.429
- Both in love?
- Completely.

15:26.480 --> 15:28.436
At least, I thought he loved me.

15:28.480 --> 15:30.198
And there he is, running away.

15:30.240 --> 15:33.789
One has to wonder why any sane man
would flee all this.

15:33.840 --> 15:36.559
It seems barely credible.

15:36.600 --> 15:39.512
I'm not lying to you, Mr Kingdom. I swear.

15:39.560 --> 15:43.473
And I truly
don't want my baby going fatherless.

15:43.520 --> 15:46.671
Brad is as real as you or me,
and I want you to find him.

15:46.720 --> 15:51.271
I wouldn't know how to proceed,
short of mounting an armed offensive.

15:51.320 --> 15:53.356
Then do that. Please.

15:53.400 --> 15:56.233
Go in with all guns blazing, if you have to.

16:13.560 --> 16:15.790
So, lesson number one.

16:17.040 --> 16:19.190
What don't we do?

16:19.240 --> 16:21.470
Run away from bees.

16:21.520 --> 16:24.671
I don't know why we're back here.
They already said he doesn't exist.

16:24.720 --> 16:26.995
I think she's making it all up.

16:27.040 --> 16:29.634
What possible motive
would she have for doing that?

16:29.680 --> 16:32.672
I haven't got all the answers.
You'll have to do some of the work.

16:32.720 --> 16:36.793
Look at that.
Another bloody petrol-head killing the planet.

16:36.840 --> 16:38.671
<i>There goes another polar bear.</i>

16:38.720 --> 16:40.836
- What?
- Polar bears.

16:40.880 --> 16:44.714
They swim to where the ice used to be,
only to find it's melted, so they drown.

16:44.760 --> 16:46.671
Since when did you become a tree-hugger?

16:46.720 --> 16:49.757
I want a future that doesn't
involve paddling to work in a canoe.

16:49.800 --> 16:52.758
There's your answer.
Fund a kayaking school for polar bears.

16:52.800 --> 16:55.234
- Ooh, nice hog.
- Thanks.

16:55.280 --> 16:57.555
- What?
- It's er... biking vernacular.

16:58.400 --> 17:01.517
Um... that's not <i>Bradley</i> Johnson,
by any chance?

17:01.560 --> 17:03.278
As I live and breathe.

17:03.320 --> 17:05.628
- Do I know you?
- No. Peter Kingdom.

17:05.680 --> 17:08.478
But I think we have a mutual acquaintance,

17:08.520 --> 17:10.238
Camilla Constantine.

17:10.280 --> 17:11.998
Never heard of her.

17:12.040 --> 17:14.031
I rather think you have.

17:14.079 --> 17:15.798
Listen, numb-nuts, I don't know her.

17:15.839 --> 17:18.035
- Numb-nuts?
- Take a hike, big guy.

17:18.079 --> 17:21.516
- Ha, ha. You, sir, are beginning to annoy me.
(Engine revs)

17:21.560 --> 17:23.835
Move or I'll run you over.

17:23.880 --> 17:26.553
- I don't think you'd like me angry.
- You've seen the Hulk?

17:26.599 --> 17:28.352
This is the Oxbridge version.

17:28.400 --> 17:31.039
- Oh-hh!
- Now just...

17:31.080 --> 17:34.277
You come back here, right now, this min!

17:34.320 --> 17:36.311
Stop messing about. Come on.

17:44.200 --> 17:45.713
Have you counted?

17:47.440 --> 17:49.158
All present and correct.

17:58.200 --> 18:00.350
d WAGNER: Ride Of The Valkyries

18:00.400 --> 18:02.277
Where's the driving music?

18:02.320 --> 18:04.356
It is driving-ish.

18:41.000 --> 18:42.911
You're not in a jet plane now.

18:42.960 --> 18:45.520
Oh, no, you're on land. My land.

18:45.560 --> 18:47.232
(Tyres squeal)

18:50.320 --> 18:52.436
- Clients.
- Not now, Lyle.

18:52.480 --> 18:54.152
They're watching us.

18:57.600 --> 18:59.909
(Chuckles) Gotcha.

19:01.240 --> 19:02.593
(Brakes squeal)

19:07.400 --> 19:09.118
(Police siren)

19:12.120 --> 19:16.079
Get in there. Sit down.

19:21.160 --> 19:22.878
Giving chase?

19:22.920 --> 19:24.911
Yeah, on behalf of my client.

19:24.960 --> 19:26.791
What is going on with you, Peter?

19:26.840 --> 19:28.671
I mean, at 3:00pm tomorrow

19:28.720 --> 19:32.429
your brother's going up before
the magistrate to try and make bail.

19:32.480 --> 19:35.233
Out of the following,
what do you think his chances are?

19:35.280 --> 19:39.398
Is it A: Slim hope?
Is it B: No hope?

19:39.440 --> 19:41.431
Or is it C: Bob Hope?

19:43.160 --> 19:46.789
Off the record, I feel really sorry for you.

19:46.840 --> 19:48.114
And on the record?

19:49.560 --> 19:52.313
I'd get as far away from Simon
as I possibly could.

19:52.360 --> 19:55.477
Don't let him take you down with him, mate.

19:57.520 --> 20:00.318
I tried to tell them
that you weren't riding the bike,

20:00.360 --> 20:04.558
but they need absolute proof
in the shape of the person who was.

20:04.600 --> 20:09.549
I'm a courier.
Any more points and I'll lose my job.

20:10.240 --> 20:14.916
This zip goes all the way down.

20:16.200 --> 20:20.079
Get me off, and I'll get you off.

20:24.480 --> 20:27.074
I'm sorry, Simon, but Peter's on business.

20:28.680 --> 20:31.877
I know it's the one call you're allowed.

20:31.920 --> 20:33.876
Such a shame you wasted it.

20:33.920 --> 20:37.959
He does know I'm here, doesn't he?
He hasn't developed amnesia?

20:38.000 --> 20:40.560
Or disappeared without a word perhaps?

20:41.360 --> 20:43.351
Oh, you're back.

20:44.400 --> 20:46.391
Where the hell have you been?

20:46.440 --> 20:49.113
Oh! Were you worried?

20:49.160 --> 20:52.152
- Of course I was bloody worried.
- <i>Ah.</i>

20:52.200 --> 20:57.194
Then now you know how I spent
every minute of the last 18 months.

20:59.640 --> 21:02.313
- So what have you got for me?
- Meaning?

21:02.360 --> 21:05.477
Well, if I'm to get bail,
then I need something concrete.

21:05.520 --> 21:08.637
You mean like a sort of part of a building?

21:08.680 --> 21:10.591
Don't joke. You never were the funny one.

21:10.640 --> 21:17.239
Look, basically, if or when I get bail,
then I need to know that you can pay it.

21:17.280 --> 21:18.633
Me?

21:18.680 --> 21:21.478
But that could take tens of thousands.

21:21.520 --> 21:25.195
- I already spent L30,000 on your...
- Well, just mortgage the house.

21:25.240 --> 21:28.073
Simon, that's the family house.

21:28.120 --> 21:29.792
Yeah. I'm family.

21:31.160 --> 21:33.151
Come on. It's only "concrete".

21:35.120 --> 21:36.997
Come on, you know you can't say no.

21:40.320 --> 21:43.039
You can always sleep on my floor
if it all goes tits up.

21:43.080 --> 21:46.436
Tits up? Aunt... please.

21:46.480 --> 21:48.835
I heard one of the nurses saying it.

21:48.880 --> 21:50.836
Rather took my fancy.

21:51.880 --> 21:55.475
So uh... d'you think I'm finished?

21:56.520 --> 21:58.158
What I think is...

21:59.200 --> 22:02.317
...you should start
finding your way out of this.

22:02.360 --> 22:06.399
My hands are tied. Simon's going down,
and he's going to take us with him.

22:06.440 --> 22:10.194
Oh, come on.
This isn't Peter Kingdom talking.

22:10.240 --> 22:12.310
Tits up for the lads.

22:12.360 --> 22:14.999
Yes, on this occasion it's actually "out".

22:15.040 --> 22:17.395
- "Tits out".
- Oh, out?

22:18.520 --> 22:21.592
Interview begins at 9:14am.

22:21.640 --> 22:24.677
Present are DC Yelland, Simon Kingdom

22:24.720 --> 22:28.474
and his solicitor... Simon Kingdom.

22:28.520 --> 22:30.750
For the record, they are one and the same.

22:33.880 --> 22:36.917
Morning. "Morning."

22:36.960 --> 22:39.838
Morning. Can um...

22:39.880 --> 22:41.677
(Clears throat)

22:41.720 --> 22:45.759
...your client tell me exactly why
he chose to fake his own suicide?

22:49.280 --> 22:53.114
After consultation with my client,
I've advised him to say nothing.

22:53.160 --> 22:55.754
Isn't that right, Mr Kingdom?

22:57.800 --> 23:00.553
For the record, Simon Kingdom
is nodding in agreement.

23:00.600 --> 23:03.398
Look, are you gonna be like this
for the whole interview?

23:04.440 --> 23:06.396
Yeah.

23:06.440 --> 23:08.158
We are.

23:11.800 --> 23:13.791
(Radio traffic)

23:14.600 --> 23:18.878
I'd like to know why you told me
there's no Captain Bradley Johnson on the base

23:18.920 --> 23:21.229
when I've clearly seen the man for myself.

23:21.280 --> 23:22.918
Because there isn't one.

23:22.960 --> 23:25.520
- I spoke to him.
- <i>No you didn't.</i>

23:25.560 --> 23:29.348
I made enquiries. You must have
spoken to a Corporal Brad Johnson.

23:29.400 --> 23:31.868
Works in the mess hall, he's a kitchen assistant.

23:31.920 --> 23:35.310
- He's not a pilot?
- <i>Listen, sonny,</i>

23:35.360 --> 23:39.592
I may not know every name
of the 1,000 or so men on this base,

23:39.640 --> 23:41.392
but I do know my pilots.

23:43.320 --> 23:46.357
You say Johnson's
been impersonating an officer?

23:46.400 --> 23:50.154
What I'm saying is,
he seems to be anything but honest.

23:50.200 --> 23:53.158
In my world, where the truth
rises and sets with the sun,

23:53.200 --> 23:56.431
dishonesty is a very unwelcome trespasser.

23:56.480 --> 23:58.072
Plus he kicked me in the goolies.

23:59.600 --> 24:03.354
- Can we speak to him?
- Not before we do. He's gone AWOL.

24:09.220 --> 24:11.654
- A corporal?
- I'm afraid so.

24:11.700 --> 24:15.295
- But he said...
- I know.

24:17.220 --> 24:19.654
He... Oh, God.

24:19.700 --> 24:21.531
Well, I can only assume

24:21.580 --> 24:26.256
he was trying to live up to what
he imagined your expectations were.

24:26.300 --> 24:28.689
Which is a lot of living up to do.

24:28.740 --> 24:31.254
A mountain's worth, if you look at this place.

24:31.300 --> 24:35.179
- So I should feel sorry for him?
- Kilimanjaro, in fact.

24:35.220 --> 24:37.290
Yes, thank you, Lyle.

24:37.340 --> 24:41.094
- You should feel what you feel.
- Or Everest.

24:44.300 --> 24:47.736
The fact is,
you've been well and truly hoodwinked.

24:47.780 --> 24:49.850
But why?

24:49.900 --> 24:52.653
He was telling you the things
he thought you wanted to hear.

24:52.700 --> 24:56.090
But he had to scarper,
because if you were to get married, say,

24:56.140 --> 24:58.734
then he'd have to tell you the truth.

24:58.780 --> 25:02.568
Although he could do the catering
at the wedding. (Chuckles)

25:06.220 --> 25:09.974
- How much do they earn?
- Excuse me?

25:11.420 --> 25:13.490
These mess hall assistants.

25:13.540 --> 25:16.816
Well, I... not much, I should imagine.

25:16.860 --> 25:19.932
I'm just wondering
how much I can sue him for.

25:20.980 --> 25:23.813
Oh. Uh... well, I'll find out for you.

25:23.860 --> 25:26.579
I want every penny he has.

25:26.620 --> 25:29.578
It's the very least my child deserves.

25:29.620 --> 25:32.851
Leave Peter out of this.
Leave all of us out of this.

25:32.900 --> 25:37.132
Get proper representation
and stop bleating on about yourself.

25:37.180 --> 25:39.330
From where I'm sitting, there's one option.

25:39.380 --> 25:41.291
I need Peter's help. I need to talk to him.

25:41.340 --> 25:43.012
You've got to get him to listen to me.

25:43.060 --> 25:45.528
The only talking you need to do
now is with your lawyer.

25:45.580 --> 25:47.616
And we both know that's not your brother.

25:51.420 --> 25:53.331
(Engine screams)

26:08.540 --> 26:12.579
Mr Kingdom, because of them jets,
I lost two fillings from my teeth.

26:12.620 --> 26:15.259
There's one up there, see,
and one down there.

26:15.300 --> 26:17.291
Shook 'em right out of my head, they did.

26:17.340 --> 26:19.729
I brought them just
in case you need them as evidence.

26:19.780 --> 26:22.010
Yeah. Where is everybody?

26:22.060 --> 26:24.176
<i>With Simon in jail, what do you expect?</i>

26:25.740 --> 26:29.289
Well, my father built this business
up from nothing, but I...

26:29.340 --> 26:31.376
I've gone in the opposite direction.

26:31.420 --> 26:34.537
From something to nothing, in one easy step.

26:34.580 --> 26:36.218
(Phone rings)

26:37.500 --> 26:40.253
Kingdom and Ki... Yes, wh?

26:40.300 --> 26:42.018
Bradley, where are you?

26:51.820 --> 26:54.857
<i>Hey, big guy. Over here.</i>

27:04.460 --> 27:07.532
I should call the military police.
You do know that, don't you?

27:07.580 --> 27:09.536
I need your help, sir.

27:09.580 --> 27:12.094
Oh, it's "sir" now, is it?
It was "numb-nuts" before.

27:12.140 --> 27:16.213
Well, it's impossible. I'm acting for Camilla,
and you assaulted my junior.

27:16.260 --> 27:18.057
I was in a panic.

27:18.100 --> 27:20.455
They're gonna discharge me. Send me home.

27:20.500 --> 27:24.129
- I want you to fight my case.
- What case would that be, exactly?

27:24.180 --> 27:27.616
- I fell in love, sir.
- Oh, you really are a tiresome man.

27:27.660 --> 27:29.890
You think you can walk into someone's life,

27:29.940 --> 27:32.329
lie through your teeth,
get what you want out of them

27:32.380 --> 27:34.257
and then abandon them without remorse?

27:34.300 --> 27:37.736
- You should run for President.
- Well, what else could I do?

27:37.780 --> 27:39.930
You've seen her house, how she lives.

27:39.980 --> 27:42.210
She wouldn't want what I really am.

27:42.260 --> 27:46.538
Wouldn't take me for serious
husband material, that's for sure.

27:46.580 --> 27:49.572
Go home, Brad, wherever that might be.

27:49.620 --> 27:53.772
And leave this gentle world of ours
to wend its honest way.

27:53.820 --> 27:55.572
You are a gold-digger.

27:55.620 --> 27:58.009
<i>You were in danger of being found out.</i>

27:58.060 --> 28:01.894
Yes, I'm sorry if the truth hurts you,
but that's all I've got to offer.

28:01.940 --> 28:04.500
<i>I want to be a pilot, sir.</i>

28:04.540 --> 28:07.816
More than anything. Ever since I can remember.

28:07.860 --> 28:11.739
But I'm colour-blind. Can't even fly a kite.

28:13.140 --> 28:15.700
I fell in love the moment I saw Cammie,

28:15.740 --> 28:20.211
and I knew - anyone would -
what sort of man would win her heart.

28:21.220 --> 28:23.780
All I did wrong was try to be what she wanted.

28:23.820 --> 28:28.655
No, Brad. The only sort of man
who could win her heart is an honest one.

28:28.700 --> 28:30.975
What she wants, what all of us want,

28:31.020 --> 28:33.898
is nothing more than someone we can trust.

28:33.940 --> 28:35.931
Sounds simple, I know,

28:35.980 --> 28:37.857
but for some reason these days

28:37.900 --> 28:42.496
it seems to be harder to find than...
than a book in the Big Brother house.

28:55.220 --> 28:57.097
Good morning.

28:57.140 --> 28:58.937
Hi.

29:04.980 --> 29:06.971
(Childproof cap clicks)

29:08.300 --> 29:09.972
(Groans)

29:10.340 --> 29:12.900
OK, I've got a plan. Now what we need to do

29:12.940 --> 29:16.649
is find a friend who's willing to
take your points on their licence.

29:16.700 --> 29:19.055
- In fact, I'd be willing to...
(Door opens)

29:20.500 --> 29:23.014
This is everything we have on Simon.

29:23.060 --> 29:26.848
It's time for you to prove yourself, young man.
Get working.

29:33.420 --> 29:34.853
(Thud)

29:35.940 --> 29:36.929
Hello?

29:40.340 --> 29:42.058
(Door opens)

29:44.740 --> 29:46.571
Hi.

29:46.620 --> 29:48.895
What are you doing here?

29:48.940 --> 29:51.295
Where else would I go?

29:51.340 --> 29:54.298
- Get out.
- We need to talk.

29:54.340 --> 29:56.217
I've been trying to do that for a month.

29:56.260 --> 29:58.490
Well, I'm here now.

29:59.740 --> 30:03.972
What I feel about you is as true as true gets.

30:04.020 --> 30:05.897
But I have to tell you something.

30:05.940 --> 30:08.818
<i>I'm not proud of it,</i>
<i>but I'm gonna tell you anyway.</i>

30:08.860 --> 30:10.088
Listen, um...

30:11.580 --> 30:13.571
Take a seat.

30:15.860 --> 30:18.055
I just need to give myself a moment.

30:18.100 --> 30:20.773
- You mean it?
- Absolutely.

30:22.020 --> 30:23.738
Don't move.

30:30.260 --> 30:31.978
(Bleeps)

30:34.820 --> 30:38.859
Hello. I have um... Captain...
Corporal Bradley Johnson here.

30:38.900 --> 30:40.891
I believe he went AWOL.

30:45.100 --> 30:46.931
<i>Yes.</i>

30:46.980 --> 30:49.050
Yes, I can keep him here, yes.

31:07.580 --> 31:11.289
OK. Calm. Nice and calm.

31:14.940 --> 31:16.851
You sneaky little bugger.

31:19.500 --> 31:21.411
Camilla, I love you.

31:21.460 --> 31:23.576
You're all that I want, I swear.

31:44.180 --> 31:47.650
- You're what?
- Leaving. Moving on.

31:47.700 --> 31:51.898
- In my hour of need?
- No. In mine.

31:52.580 --> 31:54.377
There's nothing here for me, Simon,

31:54.420 --> 31:57.139
and chances are you won't be around
for a few years.

31:57.180 --> 31:59.933
Ah. Thanks for reminding me.

31:59.980 --> 32:03.416
Even if you were,
you're not the right father for my child.

32:05.980 --> 32:07.971
Did you bring Daniel so I could say goodbye?

32:08.020 --> 32:11.092
(Sighs) Simon, he barely knows you as it is.

32:11.140 --> 32:13.574
The less contact he has with you, the better.

32:17.060 --> 32:19.858
- The magistrate's waiting.
- Sorry.

32:23.340 --> 32:25.012
Very good.

32:26.460 --> 32:27.449
Um...

32:30.020 --> 32:31.499
...be safe.

32:54.260 --> 32:56.057
SIDNEY: <i>What do we want?</i>

32:56.100 --> 32:59.536
No more jets flying over my house!

33:00.300 --> 33:02.131
When do we want it?

33:02.180 --> 33:03.977
(Coughs) Now!

33:06.180 --> 33:08.011
What do we want?

33:08.060 --> 33:10.893
No more jets flying over my house!

33:13.340 --> 33:14.853
Hello?

33:15.900 --> 33:18.414
Is er... Is Miss Constantine about?

33:18.460 --> 33:20.257
Aye, she's in her cottage.

33:20.300 --> 33:23.178
- Ha, very amusing.
- Well, there she is now.

33:25.860 --> 33:29.170
Probably gone to get dinner on
for the Theakstons.

33:30.100 --> 33:34.252
- The Theakstons?
- She's their housekeeper.

33:34.300 --> 33:36.097
But...

33:38.140 --> 33:40.210
Is <i>everyone</i> a liar?

33:40.260 --> 33:43.297
What happened to the truth, plain and simple?

33:43.340 --> 33:46.332
I didn't lie. I do live here.
You just assumed this was mine.

33:46.380 --> 33:50.055
Oh. Well, you may not have lied to me,
but you certainly did to poor Brad.

33:50.100 --> 33:52.375
What were you thinking of?

33:52.420 --> 33:54.456
I'm going to have a child to support.

33:54.500 --> 33:56.616
I'm practically penniless,

33:56.660 --> 33:58.855
totally lonely, with nothing going for me.

33:58.900 --> 34:00.538
You try being that.

34:00.580 --> 34:03.299
So you thought
you'd bag yourself an American pilot?

34:03.340 --> 34:06.332
I thought he'd take me away from all this.

34:06.380 --> 34:08.940
I don't know who's worse, you or Brad.

34:08.980 --> 34:12.688
Or maybe it's me.
Maybe I expect too much of people.

34:12.739 --> 34:16.972
I still want you to sue him.
I can't afford to bring up a child on my wages.

34:17.020 --> 34:20.456
Oh, this was all some plan of yours, was it,

34:20.500 --> 34:24.458
to get yourself knocked up
so he'd be forced to look after you?

34:24.500 --> 34:26.491
How dare you?

34:28.260 --> 34:30.774
Anyway, I grew to like him - to love him.

34:30.820 --> 34:32.650
And then what were you going to tell him?

34:32.699 --> 34:35.578
After you got married?
What were you going to say about this?

34:35.620 --> 34:37.417
The truth.

34:37.460 --> 34:39.893
<i>Hm! It would have been a bit late.</i>

34:40.780 --> 34:44.170
All I wanted was to be someone, with someone,

34:44.219 --> 34:47.212
to look after my own family
instead of someone else's.

34:47.260 --> 34:49.820
I can't believe such a simple thing
is so hard to find.

34:49.860 --> 34:51.851
It isn't.

34:51.900 --> 34:53.936
It's just that you two made it so.

34:53.980 --> 34:55.971
(Bell tinkles)

34:56.020 --> 34:58.409
I have to take this through.

34:58.460 --> 35:00.416
Camilla.

35:01.500 --> 35:03.297
We've all been lonely.

35:03.340 --> 35:07.049
We've all imagined that nothing good
would ever happen to us.

35:07.100 --> 35:09.295
But it does.

35:09.340 --> 35:11.092
I swear.

35:11.140 --> 35:13.608
Well, good luck believing that.

35:13.660 --> 35:15.730
- Honestly.
- Goodbye, Mr Kingdom.

35:22.620 --> 35:24.292
(Knock at door)

35:24.340 --> 35:26.058
How's it going?

35:26.100 --> 35:28.056
Fine. All fine, yeah.

35:28.740 --> 35:31.334
I'm counting on you. We all are.

35:31.380 --> 35:34.338
Don't worry. I'll think of something.

35:49.420 --> 35:51.411
Hey. Hey. Fingers crossed, eh?

35:53.580 --> 35:55.536
Mr Simon Kingdom.

35:55.580 --> 35:59.368
Due to the not insignificant nature
of the charges against you...

35:59.420 --> 36:02.298
<i>and because I fear you may well</i>
<i>try to flee the country,</i>

36:02.340 --> 36:09.098
again, I hereby set your bail at L100,000.

36:09.140 --> 36:11.779
What? Are you kidding?

36:11.820 --> 36:14.778
- Can he do that?
- (Mouths) Sorry.

36:14.820 --> 36:16.697
He just did.

36:28.980 --> 36:32.211
- Yelland called. They've set bail.
- Oh yes? How much?

36:32.260 --> 36:33.978
100,000.

36:34.020 --> 36:40.095
100... pounds? That's unprecedented.
We'll never raise that.

36:40.140 --> 36:44.691
<i>It looks like Simon's going to be</i>
<i>on remand for the foreseeable future.</i>

36:44.740 --> 36:49.860
Mind you, a stretch at Her Majesty's pleasure
might knock some sense into him.

36:49.900 --> 36:53.210
Why do they say that? Pleasure, I mean?

36:53.260 --> 36:57.697
Do you reckon the Queen sort of smiles
every time someone goes down... so to speak?

36:59.620 --> 37:03.249
Well, that's that, then, isn't it?

37:03.300 --> 37:05.131
Goodbye Simon.

37:05.180 --> 37:07.250
I thought you wanted it that way.

37:07.300 --> 37:09.814
Of course not. He's my brother.

37:10.820 --> 37:12.651
I mean, he may be stupid,

37:12.700 --> 37:15.578
corrupt, crazy, lazy and selfish,

37:15.620 --> 37:17.292
but I love him dearly.

37:17.340 --> 37:20.935
I wouldn't wish...
I'd never wish for this to happen.

37:24.620 --> 37:27.930
Silly question,
but you don't have the money?

37:29.100 --> 37:30.579
Does anyone?

37:31.700 --> 37:33.497
(Sighs)

37:54.180 --> 37:56.171
(Bell tinkles)

38:25.540 --> 38:27.451
Thought you'd washed your hands of me.

38:27.500 --> 38:30.731
Not quite. In you get.

38:30.780 --> 38:32.850
- Sorry?
- Get in.

38:32.900 --> 38:36.097
- I'm waiting for a cab.
- I'm tired.

38:36.140 --> 38:39.212
I want an early night
with a good book and a fine Scotch.

38:39.260 --> 38:41.899
But I won't be able to rest until I've done this.

38:42.580 --> 38:44.093
Done what?

38:45.500 --> 38:47.252
I don't want to see Brad.

38:47.300 --> 38:49.860
I think you should let me be the judge of that.

38:59.140 --> 39:03.452
As far as I can see, this is a matter
entirely for the US Air Force.

39:03.500 --> 39:05.809
Not my jurisdiction at all.

39:07.380 --> 39:10.497
They intend to send you home
and formally discharge you.

39:11.900 --> 39:13.697
I don't care.

39:15.900 --> 39:17.811
Might as well be dead.

39:17.860 --> 39:22.058
- I lost everything.
- Mm... not quite.

39:23.100 --> 39:24.499
Camilla?

39:25.700 --> 39:27.691
Come on, tell him.

39:29.900 --> 39:32.778
Come, now.
You've exhausted every other possibility.

39:32.820 --> 39:37.416
There's only the truth left.
It's a good option, I promise you.

39:48.100 --> 39:52.457
Be honest now.
Do you think... our baby will like America?

40:03.660 --> 40:06.493
There's a place for you at
HM Prison Belmarsh, I've been told.

40:06.540 --> 40:09.213
- Is that an open prison?
- (Chuckles sarcastically)

40:09.260 --> 40:11.251
Brian, could I have a minute?

40:18.740 --> 40:20.458
So you mortgaged the house?

40:21.700 --> 40:25.409
- I knew you'd come through for me.
- No, Simon, I didn't.

40:26.460 --> 40:28.451
What do you mean, you didn't?

40:28.500 --> 40:31.651
I mean I'm not going to raise bail for you.

40:32.700 --> 40:34.338
But I'll go to prison.

40:34.380 --> 40:36.530
Very probably.

40:36.580 --> 40:39.617
So why are you here? To gloat?

40:39.660 --> 40:41.173
No.

40:41.220 --> 40:44.974
I... care for you very deeply but...

40:45.020 --> 40:46.772
...and I wish you well.

40:46.820 --> 40:50.813
But other than that, I have nothing for you.

40:50.860 --> 40:54.057
Peter, Peter. Listen.

40:54.100 --> 40:56.136
I suppose really I'm just saying goodbye.

40:56.180 --> 40:58.853
- No, no, Peter.
- At least I'm saying it to your face.

40:58.900 --> 41:01.414
- Listen, something's in the bag.
- Goodbye, Simon.

41:01.460 --> 41:04.179
- Look in the bag!
- Sometimes, one just has to pay the piper.

41:06.580 --> 41:08.093
Peter!

41:23.260 --> 41:25.137
You can count it if you like.

41:28.260 --> 41:30.171
Bag. Why the bag?

41:39.860 --> 41:44.775
- Oh, dear. We are slow.
- What?

41:44.820 --> 41:46.458
I'm cleverer than you.

41:46.500 --> 41:48.331
Sharper, faster, fitter.

41:48.380 --> 41:51.611
About time we called the practice
Kingdom and Kingdom and Anderson.

41:51.660 --> 41:54.094
That is tantamount to sacrilege.

41:54.140 --> 41:56.700
I've made bail.
They're processing the payment now.

41:56.740 --> 41:58.696
Let's go and get him.

41:58.740 --> 42:00.298
How?

42:05.980 --> 42:07.698
Or Kingdom and Anderson?

42:07.740 --> 42:10.413
<i>Anderson Consulting?</i>

42:10.460 --> 42:12.178
Shall I drive?

42:19.180 --> 42:23.093
You marvellous, selfless, silly old duffer.

42:23.140 --> 42:27.053
If there's one person in this world
I can rely on, it's you, Peter.

42:27.100 --> 42:29.409
My lovely, lovely brother.

42:29.460 --> 42:32.497
I knew you wouldn't leave me. Mwah!

42:32.540 --> 42:35.293
OK, I'm off to the pub to celebrate.

42:36.340 --> 42:38.808
Don't even think about leaving town.

42:39.860 --> 42:44.615
And you, you'd better keep
a very close eye on him.

42:47.020 --> 42:50.057
I didn't think he'd do it.
Mortgage the house, I mean.

42:50.100 --> 42:51.294
He didn't.

42:51.340 --> 42:53.774
But he must have.
How else would he get the cash?

42:53.820 --> 42:55.538
Well, that's a funny one, that.

42:55.580 --> 42:59.619
I was sifting through a few things -
one bag in particular -

42:59.660 --> 43:02.458
and guess what turned up?

43:04.220 --> 43:05.972
That's private property.

43:06.020 --> 43:09.057
So is Peter's house,
but you were willing to let that go.

43:10.100 --> 43:12.250
So where's the rest?

43:12.940 --> 43:15.329
It's safe. From you.

43:18.420 --> 43:20.411
Looks like the drinks are on you, then.

43:30.940 --> 43:34.057
Lyle, you had any luck with that flight path?

43:34.100 --> 43:36.660
Oh, that? Yeah, yeah. Got 'em to divert.

43:36.700 --> 43:38.930
Once I had words, they soon listened.

43:38.980 --> 43:41.494
Nobody messes with Lyle Anderson.

43:41.540 --> 43:43.417
(Glasses rattle)

43:43.460 --> 43:46.054
(Jet engine roars)

43:53.660 --> 43:55.491
Pillock.

44:02.100 --> 44:04.091
(lnsect buzzes)

44:19.980 --> 44:22.972
Sidney. Brought you a little something.

44:23.020 --> 44:25.250
(Chuckles)

44:25.300 --> 44:26.813
Some tea?

44:36.700 --> 44:38.338
Ah, Mr Kingdom...

44:38.380 --> 44:40.211
Hello, Mr Kingdom...

44:40.260 --> 44:43.536
See? Now I'm just going to...

44:43.580 --> 44:45.411
Ooh, good luck.

44:52.540 --> 44:55.100
Hi. There you go.

44:55.140 --> 45:00.260
I did try and tell you about the bag.
It's clean money, I swear.

45:00.300 --> 45:02.734
It's just... just some savings, you know.

45:02.780 --> 45:05.419
Yes. Well, I don't know where it came from

45:05.460 --> 45:08.657
and part of me doesn't want to know,
but I will tell you one thing.

45:08.700 --> 45:12.056
If you ever do anything to me like that again,

45:13.100 --> 45:15.330
you'll wish you were dead.

45:16.380 --> 45:19.258
- Do I make myself clear?
- Crystal.

45:21.660 --> 45:25.289
Good. Well... Kingdom and Kingdom?????«??????????????????????????????????????????
