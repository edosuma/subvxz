00:00.420 --> 00:03.620
♪♪

00:04.580 --> 00:08.250
Great news!
Our couch problem is solved!

00:08.250 --> 00:10.080
What couch problem?

00:11.830 --> 00:13.170
Uh, the one that's
got your knees up higher

00:13.170 --> 00:15.000
than when you're
getting a pap smear.

00:17.120 --> 00:21.080
So, Logan's remodeling
her condo, and she's giving me
her old couch!

00:21.080 --> 00:23.790
Oh, my god, oh, my god,
oh, my god...

00:23.790 --> 00:25.750
-Help me up
so I can be excited.
-Okay.

00:26.880 --> 00:29.040
Both:
We're getting a new couch!

00:29.040 --> 00:31.210
-And the best part is--
-How can there be
better parts?

00:31.210 --> 00:35.120
It's a-comin a-right a-now!

00:35.120 --> 00:38.000
-Oh my god, do you love it?
-Oh my god, I hate it!

00:39.830 --> 00:41.830
What? Why?

00:41.830 --> 00:43.790
It's hideous.

00:44.880 --> 00:48.120
It looks like the product
of years of couch incest.

00:49.710 --> 00:52.120
It's a-goin' a-back a-now!

00:52.120 --> 00:53.170
It's not going anywhere.

00:53.170 --> 00:55.040
Do you understand that Logan
is my boss?

00:55.040 --> 00:56.960
What if she comes over
and the couch isn't here?

00:56.960 --> 00:59.710
What if anyone else comes over
and the couch is here?

01:01.170 --> 01:04.120
Gabi... Logan picked me
out of everyone in the office

01:04.120 --> 01:05.790
to give the couch to.

01:05.790 --> 01:08.040
Sending it back
would be a slap in her face.

01:08.040 --> 01:10.960
But I don't want it!

01:10.960 --> 01:14.830
Well, (scoffs) I mean, I don't
wanna be an assistant
my entire life.

01:14.830 --> 01:17.000
And when it comes time
for a promotion,

01:17.000 --> 01:20.670
who do you think'll get it?
The girl who rudely
gave back the couch,

01:20.670 --> 01:21.830
or the girl
who kept the couch,

01:21.830 --> 01:24.120
because it reflects
on her boss' kindness
and good taste?

01:25.670 --> 01:30.880
So you really think
that... this couch is, uh...

01:30.880 --> 01:34.120
gonna get you a promotion?
'Cause you know, that's really
not how it works, Sofia.

01:34.120 --> 01:38.040
Oh, Gabi, that's exactly
how it works.

01:38.040 --> 01:40.750
Before this, Logan and I
had nothing in common.

01:40.750 --> 01:41.880
Now we have the couch.

01:41.880 --> 01:44.040
So, whenever we're alone,
or in the bathroom,

01:44.040 --> 01:46.920
or there's a lull
in conversation, she'll be like,

01:46.920 --> 01:48.080
"How's the couch?"

01:48.080 --> 01:51.790
And I'll be like,
"Oh, my god! We love it!"

01:51.790 --> 01:54.710
And she'll be like,
"I knew you would.
You want a promotion?"

01:56.000 --> 01:59.960
And that, my friend,
is how it works.

01:59.960 --> 02:02.960
Okay, if it's that important
to you, I guess we'll keep
the couch,

02:02.960 --> 02:04.750
but just know that I hate it!

02:04.750 --> 02:07.250
Thank you!

02:07.250 --> 02:08.170
And one more thing,

02:08.170 --> 02:09.790
and you might not
be interested in this,
but, um...

02:09.790 --> 02:11.080
there is a matching ottoman.

Okay... what's goin' on in here?

02:38.920 --> 02:40.880
I'm makin' freakin' fudge.

02:40.880 --> 02:43.710
Well, why make fudge
when you could have
this white chocolate?

02:44.830 --> 02:46.880
Ugh!

02:46.880 --> 02:48.960
Come on, we haven't used
the punch card in a week.

02:48.960 --> 02:51.670
Which means I...
had to punch myself.

02:52.750 --> 02:54.750
All right, here's something
that'll... keep you

02:54.750 --> 02:56.790
from thinkin' about sex.

02:56.790 --> 02:57.830
Ooof. What is that?

02:57.830 --> 02:59.040
What is that?

02:59.040 --> 03:00.790
That's a couch.

03:00.790 --> 03:02.000
Digesting another couch?

03:03.620 --> 03:05.920
Sofia's boss dumped
her crappy couch on us.

03:05.920 --> 03:07.710
Oh! Well, you're in luck.

03:07.710 --> 03:09.670
I just developed this new
app for called "Crap4Cash."

03:09.670 --> 03:10.790
Hey... that's great,

03:10.790 --> 03:11.880
I have a ton of crap

03:11.880 --> 03:13.620
and I need a ton of cash.

03:14.750 --> 03:15.960
Everyone does, Gabi.

03:15.960 --> 03:17.830
But what does everybody hate?

03:17.830 --> 03:19.750
Meeting the creep who bought
your crap.

03:19.750 --> 03:20.830
That's why I developed

03:20.830 --> 03:22.250
an anonymous delivery service

03:22.250 --> 03:24.040
that shows up so you don't have
to meet the creep...

03:24.040 --> 03:25.880
who bought your crap.

03:25.880 --> 03:27.960
My god! That's genius!

03:27.960 --> 03:29.790
Give me your phone,
I'll put your couch on there.

03:29.790 --> 03:31.710
No... I wish,
but I can't sell it.

03:31.710 --> 03:32.830
Well, you don't have to accept
any bids.

03:32.830 --> 03:33.960
I'll just show you how it works,

03:33.960 --> 03:35.710
give me your phone.

03:35.710 --> 03:37.710
Oh... fudge!

03:37.710 --> 03:40.880
What-- What-- What--
What are you doing?

03:40.880 --> 03:43.880
Today is our first weigh-in
at Fat Fighters.

03:43.880 --> 03:46.540
Yeah, well, we're not there yet.

03:46.540 --> 03:47.620
So, let me get this straight,

03:47.620 --> 03:48.670
you're taking the thing

03:48.670 --> 03:49.750
with the most fat in it

03:49.750 --> 03:50.920
to a diet center?

03:51.920 --> 03:53.920
No, I'm also taking Yolanda.

03:58.790 --> 03:59.920
(cash register sound)

03:59.920 --> 04:01.500
What was that?

04:01.500 --> 04:02.540
That's the sound the app makes

04:02.540 --> 04:03.620
when someone bids on your crap.

04:03.620 --> 04:04.920
Someone just offered you 500.

04:06.580 --> 04:07.710
Dollars?

04:09.750 --> 04:11.620
Oh my god, that's
with the photo?

04:11.620 --> 04:13.000
-(cash register sound)
-650!

04:13.000 --> 04:17.580
My god, are you kidding me?
No, no, I can't sell it,
I promised Sofia I wouldn't.

04:17.580 --> 04:18.710
-(cash register sound)
-Eight hund-oh!

04:18.710 --> 04:19.750
Sold!

04:25.710 --> 04:28.750
Oh my god... that's the rabbi
from your wedding!

04:28.750 --> 04:30.620
Oh, Rabbi Shapiro.

04:30.620 --> 04:31.670
Let's go say hi.

04:31.670 --> 04:33.620
Oh-- Hell, no!

04:33.620 --> 04:35.580
Uh... I never told you this...

04:35.580 --> 04:36.830
but we hooked up
on your wedding night.

04:38.460 --> 04:39.960
You slept with him?

04:39.960 --> 04:42.540
Haven't the Jews
suffered enough?

04:43.960 --> 04:46.750
Shut up! We were dating
for a while,

04:46.750 --> 04:47.960
then suddenly
he stopped calling.

04:47.960 --> 04:49.790
I have no idea what happened.

04:49.790 --> 04:52.620
I do. You let him
see you naked.

04:52.620 --> 04:54.580
(indistinct)
I'm outta here.

04:54.580 --> 04:59.580
Oh, really? So you have
no desire to rekindle
with the rabbi?

04:59.580 --> 05:01.460
Damn right I don't.

05:02.500 --> 05:05.670
Although he does look cute
in that rabbi sweater.

05:06.790 --> 05:09.830
Hello, everybody.
I am Ben Shapiro,

05:09.830 --> 05:13.540
a rabbi
and a Fat Fighter counselor.

05:13.540 --> 05:16.790
I went from wandering around
the desert to wondering,
"Where's dessert?

05:17.920 --> 05:19.920
He still makes me laugh.

05:19.920 --> 05:23.710
Today's topic... emotions.

05:23.710 --> 05:26.460
Instead of eating our feelings,

05:26.460 --> 05:30.460
we have to learn
to express it. Let it out!

05:30.460 --> 05:31.830
Why the hell
you stop calling me?

05:32.880 --> 05:34.580
Yolanda?

05:35.670 --> 05:36.790
How are you?

05:40.540 --> 05:43.500
Hey! Hey! You can't eat that!

05:43.500 --> 05:44.750
Fatty says what?

05:46.710 --> 05:48.620
That's like 20 points!

05:48.620 --> 05:52.580
Oh! This is actually
fat-free fudge!

05:52.580 --> 05:53.620
Want some, honey?

05:56.460 --> 05:58.460
Oh my god!

05:58.460 --> 05:59.580
Do you know how long
I've been looking

05:59.580 --> 06:02.540
for a fat-free dessert
that actually tastes good?

06:02.540 --> 06:05.790
Judging from your Cosby sweater,
I'd say since the '90s.

06:08.880 --> 06:11.420
Where did get this?
I would pay a fortune for it.

06:11.420 --> 06:14.540
Well, you would have to.
Because it's very, very
hard to find.

06:14.540 --> 06:16.710
Name your price,
my husband's rich.

06:16.710 --> 06:18.500
You're married?

06:19.710 --> 06:22.710
I had to break it off
because there was no future.

06:22.710 --> 06:26.790
Being with a non-Jewish woman
would break my mother's heart.

06:28.420 --> 06:30.420
But you know what?
And I don't mind saying this

06:30.420 --> 06:32.790
in front of the entire group.
After seeing you again,

06:32.790 --> 06:36.500
and feeling, the way I feel
right now, I am reminded

06:36.500 --> 06:38.540
of those very poignant words,

06:38.540 --> 06:41.790
you must not let anyone
define your limits

06:41.790 --> 06:44.540
because of where you come from.

06:44.540 --> 06:47.830
Your only limit...
is your soul.

06:47.830 --> 06:49.420
Was that Gandhi?

06:49.420 --> 06:50.460
Ratatouille.

06:55.420 --> 06:57.620
Oh, Sofia!

06:57.620 --> 06:58.750
I have a huge surprise.

06:58.750 --> 07:00.620
-Me, too!
-Okay, mine's more
of a visual,

07:00.620 --> 07:01.670
so I'll go first.

07:01.670 --> 07:04.580
Logan's coming over
for dinner to see the couch!

07:07.420 --> 07:08.500
What?

07:08.500 --> 07:09.580
Yeah.

07:09.580 --> 07:10.670
So get this,
we were in the bathroom,

07:10.670 --> 07:11.710
and
for the first time ever,

07:11.710 --> 07:13.330
there were
no uncomfortable silences.

07:13.330 --> 07:15.420
Why? Because we talked
about the couch!

07:15.420 --> 07:17.380
And I was like, "Do you wanna
come over and see the couch?"

07:17.380 --> 07:19.620
And she was all,
"Sure, I'd love to."

07:19.620 --> 07:22.620
And... so now, she's
coming over for dinner
with me and the couch,

07:22.620 --> 07:24.460
which means the promotion
can't be far off.

07:24.460 --> 07:25.620
What's your surprise?

07:28.380 --> 07:30.460
Gabi, where's the couch?

07:30.460 --> 07:32.620
S-- Surprise.

07:36.080 --> 07:39.000
Uh... where's the couch?

07:39.000 --> 07:42.210
Um... I turned it
into $800.

07:42.210 --> 07:43.920
You sold the couch?

07:43.920 --> 07:45.120
I didn't mean to.

07:45.120 --> 07:47.040
Well, get it back!

07:48.880 --> 07:51.000
That might not
be exactly possible,

07:51.000 --> 07:54.000
because I sold it on Josh's
new app, "Crap4Cash,"

07:54.000 --> 07:57.210
where everything you sell
is anonymous. so you never
have to meet the creep

07:57.210 --> 07:59.790
who bought your crap!

08:00.830 --> 08:01.920
I cannot believe you,

08:01.920 --> 08:04.000
I told you
that this was my ticket in!

08:05.080 --> 08:06.080
Into what?

08:07.170 --> 08:09.250
Into... a promotion!

08:09.250 --> 08:11.880
Do you listen
to anything I say?

08:11.880 --> 08:13.830
Like... do you even know
that I wanna be a writer?

08:14.880 --> 08:16.120
I do now.

08:16.120 --> 08:19.120
Oh my god! How am I
even friends with you?

08:19.120 --> 08:20.880
Why am I even friends with you?

08:20.880 --> 08:23.830
I don't understand
why you're getting so mad,
I do bad stuff all the time!

08:23.830 --> 08:26.920
This isn't-- it's--
this isn't like
any other time, Gabi,

08:26.920 --> 08:28.000
this is about my career!

08:28.000 --> 08:29.210
As a writer!

08:29.210 --> 08:32.080
Gabi, I told you how important
this was to me and-- and...

08:32.080 --> 08:34.960
now I may never get a promotion,
and not only that, come Monday,

08:34.960 --> 08:36.080
I might not even
have a job.

08:36.080 --> 08:37.830
Sofia, I'm really sorry.

08:37.830 --> 08:39.120
Oh my god, Gabi,
you are always sorry.

08:39.120 --> 08:40.880
You're always sorry.

08:40.880 --> 08:43.790
How many more times
are you gonna be sorry?

08:43.790 --> 08:44.960
One more.

08:46.040 --> 08:47.210
That was rhetorical.

08:47.210 --> 08:50.880
Rhetorical. Hey, that's
a good word for a writer.

08:52.040 --> 08:53.710
I'm done.

08:56.210 --> 08:58.000
We can still get the ottoman!

09:02.710 --> 09:05.790
Ohhh... you know, I never
thought I'd be on a date

09:05.790 --> 09:07.170
at a Fat Fighters clinic.

09:07.170 --> 09:09.790
Well, I was gonna take you
to a nice restaurant,

09:09.790 --> 09:12.120
but I know how difficult
it is to dine out

09:12.120 --> 09:14.080
when you start a new program.

09:14.080 --> 09:17.830
Ohhh... and who knew
you were such an amazing cook.

09:17.830 --> 09:20.920
-(both laugh)
-I mean...
that five-point stuffing

09:20.920 --> 09:22.170
was
mother-stuffing delicious!

09:22.170 --> 09:24.960
(both laugh)

09:24.960 --> 09:26.170
Thank you.

09:26.170 --> 09:28.670
So how'd you end up
workin' here anyway?

09:28.670 --> 09:31.120
Well, about a month ago,
I was napping on my mom's couch,

09:31.120 --> 09:34.830
and it sorta kinda
broke under my weight.

09:34.830 --> 09:36.960
Oh, well, you won't
break me, baby.

09:38.000 --> 09:39.080
Promise?

09:39.080 --> 09:40.170
(phone ringing)

09:40.170 --> 09:44.120
Oh. Oh, it's my mom.

09:44.120 --> 09:46.120
-(phone ringing)
-Should I send it to voice mail?

09:46.120 --> 09:49.080
Yeah, I'm gonna send that
to voicemail.

09:49.080 --> 09:50.080
Come here.

09:51.170 --> 09:53.000
-Oh.
-Now I feel guilty.

09:54.790 --> 09:56.170
Maybe I should call her back.

09:56.170 --> 09:58.920
No. I am not calling her back.

09:58.920 --> 10:02.080
-No. Maybe just a text.
-Aw.

10:02.080 --> 10:04.670
No, not even a text.

10:04.670 --> 10:08.040
Ugh... I'm sorry.
This can't be a turn on.

10:08.040 --> 10:10.000
You got that right.

10:10.000 --> 10:12.790
You know what?
Screw this, Yolanda.

10:12.790 --> 10:14.830
No... screw this Yolanda.

10:15.920 --> 10:18.000
Oh, I intend to.

10:19.710 --> 10:21.620
But first I have
to tell you something.

10:21.620 --> 10:24.000
Those two months
we spent together
were amazing.

10:24.000 --> 10:26.120
I let you go once.
I'm not gonna

10:26.120 --> 10:28.790
make the same mistake again.

10:28.790 --> 10:30.040
I'm gonna tell my mother
about us.

10:30.040 --> 10:34.000
You would risk your relationship
with your mom for me?

10:34.000 --> 10:35.670
As the saying goes,

10:35.670 --> 10:39.750
"Without pain,
without sacrifice,
we would have nothing."

10:39.750 --> 10:40.920
Old Testament?

10:40.920 --> 10:42.000
Fight Club.

10:47.080 --> 10:48.920
(elevator dings)

10:51.750 --> 10:52.750
Hey, Yolanda.

10:55.830 --> 10:58.920
I'm so glad you're here.
Uh, quick favor... can you
tape me into this box?

11:01.080 --> 11:03.620
Sure, baby.
Let me ask you a question.

11:03.620 --> 11:05.920
(laughs)
You think I can impress
my boyfriend's mama

11:05.920 --> 11:07.620
in this outfit?

11:07.620 --> 11:09.920
Uh... lose the cleavage.

11:16.960 --> 11:18.750
You wanna tell me
why I'm doin' this?

11:18.750 --> 11:20.920
I'm tryin' to find out
where the Cash4Crap
anonymous warehouse

11:20.920 --> 11:23.880
is so I can
save my relationship
with Sofia.

11:23.880 --> 11:26.710
Okay.
You do you, girl.

11:27.710 --> 11:29.580
(elevator dings)

11:41.960 --> 11:44.000
You got the stuff?

11:44.000 --> 11:46.580
Oh, I got the stuff.
You got the cash?

11:55.620 --> 11:57.620
Do I smell fudge?

11:57.620 --> 12:00.670
100 percent pure brown gold.
First taste is free.

12:00.670 --> 12:02.620
I-- I-- I really shouldn't.

12:02.620 --> 12:04.960
-They're fat free.
-Fat free?

12:07.000 --> 12:08.880
Son of a bitch!

12:08.880 --> 12:10.880
Devon! Jenny!

12:10.880 --> 12:14.580
Screw Fat Fighters.
Papa's getting liposuction.

12:20.580 --> 12:22.750
(phone ringing)

12:22.750 --> 12:27.540
Hey! Gabi!
Have you seen my desk chair?

12:27.540 --> 12:28.830
It was here last night.

12:28.830 --> 12:31.620
Now it's gone,
and there's a post-it note

12:31.620 --> 12:34.460
that says, "Thanks. Gabi."

12:34.460 --> 12:37.750
Well... I'm, uh, kinda
sitting in it right now.

12:37.750 --> 12:39.210
Where are you?

12:39.210 --> 12:41.790
Here's the thing...
I sold your chair
on Crap4Cash

12:41.790 --> 12:43.880
so I could find out
where the secret warehouse is.

12:43.880 --> 12:46.790
What? Why didn't you
sell something that was yours?

12:46.790 --> 12:48.710
Nobody wants anything I own!

12:49.920 --> 12:51.830
I'm sorry, I-- I-- I don't
understand what you're doing.

12:51.830 --> 12:53.790
Are you following
the delivery truck?

12:53.790 --> 12:54.880
Not exactly.

12:54.880 --> 12:56.620
Well, if you're
not following the truck,

12:56.620 --> 12:57.920
how do you know
where the--

12:57.920 --> 13:00.750
You're sitting in the chair
in a box in the back
of the truck, aren't you?

13:00.750 --> 13:02.830
I had to do it, Josh.
It's the only way I could
find out

13:02.830 --> 13:05.830
where the secret warehouse is,
and fix my relationship
with Sofia.

13:05.830 --> 13:07.460
(truck gate opening)

13:07.460 --> 13:10.460
Shoot, someone's coming!
Gotta go, nothing is
impossible, bye!

13:16.620 --> 13:19.710
Hey, guys?
Does the secret warehouse
have a bathroom?

13:20.750 --> 13:23.460
Asked the chair...

13:25.880 --> 13:31.750
Okay. I laid out all of my mom's
favorite foods. Oh, shoot,
I forgot dessert.

13:31.750 --> 13:33.420
She loves chocolate.

13:33.420 --> 13:34.710
Let's hope so.

13:34.710 --> 13:36.710
(knocking on door)

13:39.620 --> 13:40.670
Gabi?

13:40.670 --> 13:42.670
Rabbi Shapiro?

13:42.670 --> 13:45.500
Is your first name... Marilyn?

13:46.670 --> 13:48.540
Gabi. Didn't I just
pack you in a box?

13:48.540 --> 13:50.580
Yeah, that's why I'm here.
I-- I sold Sofia's couch,

13:50.580 --> 13:53.460
we had a huge fight,
and I tracked it
to this apartment,

13:53.460 --> 13:54.580
and now I really gotta
get it back.

13:54.580 --> 13:56.500
Oh, girl, I could've
just driven you here.

13:57.670 --> 13:59.920
Now! I know that now!

13:59.920 --> 14:01.580
Oh.

14:01.580 --> 14:02.920
What are you doing here?

14:02.920 --> 14:05.580
Oh, this is
Ben's mother's apartment,

14:05.580 --> 14:07.620
and we're about to tell her
we're dating.

14:07.620 --> 14:09.540
Oh, that's so cute,
I didn't know you guys
were--

14:09.540 --> 14:12.500
Oh my god, my couch!

14:12.500 --> 14:13.710
She's here!

14:14.880 --> 14:16.670
-Benny!
-What's, uh, what's--
what's happening?

14:16.670 --> 14:18.620
Your girlfriend is gorgeous!

14:18.620 --> 14:20.380
No... Ma... no.

14:20.380 --> 14:21.460
Oh... no... oh,
Mrs. Shapiro...

14:21.460 --> 14:22.790
A little young...
but gorgeous.

14:22.790 --> 14:24.540
Oh, uh, Mrs. Shapiro,
I'm actually--

14:24.540 --> 14:26.380
And look at that tuchus.

14:27.710 --> 14:31.750
Sometimes God gives
with two hands.

14:31.750 --> 14:34.620
-Ma--
-Mrs. Shapiro, really,
I'm-- I'm actually just here

14:34.620 --> 14:38.540
because I really want--
-Sweetie you give me
a grandchild,

14:38.540 --> 14:41.540
you can have anything
you want.

14:44.500 --> 14:46.540
-Can I have your couch?
-Anything!

14:46.540 --> 14:47.620
Oh!

14:47.620 --> 14:48.830
Benny! We're goin'
off the pill!

14:50.620 --> 14:53.830
You made me the happiest woman
on Earth!

14:53.830 --> 14:56.620
Are you gonna tell your mother
I'm your girlfriend or not?

14:56.620 --> 14:58.830
I've never seen her so happy!

14:58.830 --> 15:00.670
Are you kidding me?

15:00.670 --> 15:02.500
All right,
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

15:02.500 --> 15:04.830
This time it's gonna require
a little Schnapps.

15:04.830 --> 15:06.580
I-- I thought you said
she couldn't drink

15:06.580 --> 15:07.710
because
of her high blood pressure?

15:07.710 --> 15:10.460
-For me! It's for me!
-Oh.

15:10.460 --> 15:12.750
I'm so happy to see you.

15:12.750 --> 15:14.830
Oh, you think
you're happy.

15:14.830 --> 15:17.790
Benny never brought home
a girl before.

15:17.790 --> 15:21.750
And so blonde and beautiful.

15:21.750 --> 15:24.330
I'd never know
you're Jewish.

15:27.500 --> 15:30.580
You are... Jewish, right?

15:31.620 --> 15:35.460
Yes! Yes, I'm-- I'm
very Jewish, I'm like, uh...

15:35.460 --> 15:39.540
like, uh, Hanukkah, um, uh,
Seth Rogen, deli platters!

15:42.330 --> 15:43.750
Ma, I got somethin'
to tell ya.

15:43.750 --> 15:45.540
That girl
that you're talking to--

15:45.540 --> 15:47.540
Is an angel!

15:47.540 --> 15:49.380
She's not my girlfriend.

15:49.380 --> 15:52.290
-What?
-This is my girlfriend.

15:53.620 --> 15:55.620
Then who the hell's this?

15:55.620 --> 15:58.540
I'm-- I'm just a...
poor little Jewish girl

15:58.540 --> 16:00.580
who really, really
wants your couch.

16:01.790 --> 16:05.380
Oy! I'm... so sorry
for the mix-up, Yolanda.

16:09.380 --> 16:14.330
Well... I guess
you're more age-appropriate.

16:14.330 --> 16:17.330
Benny, if-- if you're happy,
then I'm happy.

16:17.330 --> 16:20.330
Ma, I've never been happier.

16:20.330 --> 16:23.580
Oh, it's a pleasure
to meet you, Yo-lan-da?

16:23.580 --> 16:27.620
Oh... oh...
the pleasure's mine.

16:27.620 --> 16:31.500
I never met
an African-American Jew.

16:33.580 --> 16:38.290
Are you from the lost tribe
of...? Ethiopia!

16:39.500 --> 16:41.750
Uh-- uh... it's...

16:41.750 --> 16:43.620
uh... uh...

16:43.620 --> 16:47.580
More like the lost tribe
of Inglewood.

16:51.670 --> 16:54.580
I'm, uh-- I'm not Jewish.

16:54.580 --> 16:58.670
-What?
-Ma... it doesn't matter
if she's Jewish or not,

16:58.670 --> 17:00.380
-I love her.
-Ah, ahh...

17:00.380 --> 17:01.460
Ma, Ma!

17:01.460 --> 17:02.540
Mrs. Shapiro!

17:02.540 --> 17:04.380
Ma-- Let's-- Let's ring
Dr. Schwartz next door!

17:04.380 --> 17:05.500
I can't breathe!

17:05.500 --> 17:06.710
-All right, come on, Ma.
-I can't breathe!

17:06.710 --> 17:08.380
Oh, for the love of Jesus!

17:08.380 --> 17:09.620
Oh, don't say Jesus!

17:09.620 --> 17:13.290
-All right... let's go.
-I'm going fast!

17:13.290 --> 17:14.500
Slow down, Ma.

17:14.500 --> 17:16.460
Just don't worry.

17:16.460 --> 17:18.540
Oh my god.

17:22.250 --> 17:24.290
Hello, old friend.

17:24.290 --> 17:25.500
It's a mitzvah!

17:30.460 --> 17:34.580
Don't think I brought you back
'cause I like you, okay?

17:34.580 --> 17:36.330
'Cause I don't...
I did it for Sofia.

17:36.330 --> 17:39.420
(key in door)
Oh, my god, she's here.
She's here!

17:39.420 --> 17:41.620
So-fi-a...

17:41.620 --> 17:43.290
Hi.

17:43.290 --> 17:44.670
Okay, you're not gonna
be mad at me in a minute,

17:44.670 --> 17:46.540
because I have
a huge surprise for you.

17:46.540 --> 17:48.380
Yeah, well, I kinda have one
for you, too.

17:48.380 --> 17:50.330
Okay, mine's more
of a visual, so let's--

17:50.330 --> 17:52.420
No, um... tryin'
to be a better listener,

17:52.420 --> 17:56.250
so, um...
you go first.

17:57.500 --> 18:00.380
Well, Logan's not coming over
to see the couch.

18:05.330 --> 18:07.380
What?

18:07.380 --> 18:09.500
Yeah, it turned out
that giving me that couch

18:09.500 --> 18:13.290
was just a mean joke
she and her rich friends
play on their assistants. Pfft.

18:13.290 --> 18:15.420
So... what's your surprise?

18:27.540 --> 18:30.120
Ohh.

18:30.120 --> 18:33.290
Oh... well...
so I guess it wasn't that hard
to get back after all.

18:36.540 --> 18:39.170
Nope. No... not at all,

18:39.170 --> 18:41.380
I just had to...
pack myself into a box

18:41.380 --> 18:43.290
to get to the warehouse,
so I could steal the invoice,

18:43.290 --> 18:45.210
to get the address of the person
who bought the couch,

18:45.210 --> 18:46.540
which turned out to be
Yolanda's boyfriend's mother,

18:46.540 --> 18:48.380
who would only give me
the couch if I was Jewish,

18:48.380 --> 18:50.250
and willing to make babies
with her son.

18:51.620 --> 18:54.330
So I told her I was Jewish,
and then she fainted,

18:54.330 --> 18:55.380
which gave me the opportunity

18:55.380 --> 18:56.620
to steal the couch back
for my best friend,

18:56.620 --> 18:59.120
who I love
more than anything else
in the world.

19:02.330 --> 19:05.540
So, uh... you kn--
now's where you hug me,
and you say you love me,

19:05.540 --> 19:08.330
and, uh, it's all, you know,
water under the couch...

19:09.380 --> 19:11.330
Yeah, well... it's not.

19:11.330 --> 19:12.540
It's not? Why is it not?

19:12.540 --> 19:14.540
Because that's not the problem.

19:14.540 --> 19:17.290
The problem is
that you don't respect me,
and you don't listen to me,

19:17.290 --> 19:20.380
and you don't care
about how important
my career is to me.

19:20.380 --> 19:25.120
Oh... well, uh, guess, uh,
just, uh, nothin', uh,
nothin' more to say, then.

19:25.120 --> 19:26.290
What's that?

19:26.290 --> 19:28.080
Nothing. But open it.

19:31.500 --> 19:33.170
"Intro to Journalism"?

19:33.170 --> 19:36.500
Uh, I-- I took the $800
I made selling the couch
and I signed you up

19:36.500 --> 19:37.580
for night classes.

19:37.580 --> 19:40.080
What?

19:40.080 --> 19:43.330
Yeah, because you're a writer!
See, I listen!

19:45.290 --> 19:47.380
And if-- And if you really,
really wanna be a journalist,

19:47.380 --> 19:50.380
then you need some training
to go with that natural talent
that you already have.

19:51.540 --> 19:54.040
Gabi, it-- I don't know
what to say.

19:54.040 --> 19:55.380
That's why I got you the class!

20:00.210 --> 20:02.380
And... you know what I realized?

20:02.380 --> 20:04.420
I mean, this whole time,
I wasn't trying to get
the couch back,

20:04.420 --> 20:07.120
I was trying to get you back,
you know? Because...

20:07.120 --> 20:09.500
because...
you're my ugly couch.

20:13.210 --> 20:17.290
-And you're my ugly couch!
-Ohhh!

20:17.290 --> 20:19.290
Both:
Owww!

20:19.290 --> 20:22.500
Oy, this fakakta couch already.

20:24.830 --> 20:27.040
So, we waited at the hospital
for hours.

20:27.040 --> 20:30.920
And when she finally came to,
she forbid Ben from seein' me.

20:30.920 --> 20:34.790
But, the good news is,
right after that,
she fell into a coma.

20:36.080 --> 20:37.790
That's horrible.

20:37.790 --> 20:40.040
Not for my sex life.

20:40.040 --> 20:42.920
As long as she's out...
the son is in!

20:46.620 --> 20:47.920
What you need, bro?

20:47.920 --> 20:51.000
I need a fix...
got a dime bag?

20:53.580 --> 20:55.670
Careful with that... it's uncut.

20:58.000 --> 21:00.080
I gained six pounds?

21:00.080 --> 21:02.750
So... all of us gained weight.

21:02.750 --> 21:03.790
How is that even possible?

21:03.790 --> 21:05.710
We've been exercising,

21:05.710 --> 21:06.880
counting points...

21:06.880 --> 21:07.960
the only outside food

21:07.960 --> 21:09.580
that I've eaten is--

21:10.880 --> 21:13.670
Oh, my god!

21:13.670 --> 21:15.880
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold up!

21:15.880 --> 21:17.960
Before you do anything...

21:17.960 --> 21:19.880
consider this...

21:21.040 --> 21:22.620
is anyone really gonna notice

21:22.620 --> 21:23.670
that you gained six pounds?

21:23.670 --> 21:24.750
Oh!
