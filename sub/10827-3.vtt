WEBVTT

00:17.120 --> 00:18.501
TOM [OFFSCREEN]: And we're
going to the Man U game.

00:18.535 --> 00:20.537
-He's not on call or
anything then?

00:20.572 --> 00:21.642
-No.

00:21.676 --> 00:22.746
He promised to make
it this time.

00:22.781 --> 00:24.058
No emergencies, no
distractions,

00:24.093 --> 00:25.335
just me and my dad.

00:31.341 --> 00:33.309
Let's see the drawing,
Rhydian.

00:33.343 --> 00:34.137
-Yeah.

00:34.172 --> 00:34.793
I bet it's brilliant.

00:41.938 --> 00:44.182
-What's that got to
do with family?

00:44.216 --> 00:46.080
That's just spooky.

00:46.115 --> 00:47.254
-And weird.

00:53.570 --> 00:55.365
Rhydian, stop it.

01:01.785 --> 01:03.063
-Is that normal enough
for you?

01:07.791 --> 01:09.862
-You're not actually going to
listen to them, are you?

01:09.897 --> 01:10.484
-Why not?

01:10.518 --> 01:12.934
You do.

01:12.969 --> 01:15.109
Pretending to be something
you're not.

01:15.144 --> 01:16.731
You're just like them,
pretty and fake.

01:30.469 --> 01:31.953
[singing]

01:31.988 --> 01:34.680
A promise that I keep, I'll
never share, I'll never speak.

01:34.715 --> 01:38.132
To my grave the secret goes.

01:38.167 --> 01:40.824
The beating heart, the
beating heart.

01:40.859 --> 01:43.275
Where mystic creatures
wandered far.

01:43.310 --> 01:46.589
Though these veins a
wolfblood flows.

01:46.623 --> 01:49.109
Through these veins
a wolfblood flows.

01:51.421 --> 01:55.356
-The question, what does family
mean in the 21st first

01:55.391 --> 01:58.635
century, is something that we've
been exploring across

01:58.670 --> 02:01.604
different subject
areas this term.

02:01.638 --> 02:06.609
We are very proud of our
students' work, and I'm sure

02:06.643 --> 02:08.404
that you will be too.

02:08.437 --> 02:17.551
[applause]

02:17.585 --> 02:21.417
-"Shine the light to reveal
what made me who I am."

02:21.451 --> 02:22.866
-It's ultraviolet.

02:22.901 --> 02:24.178
-Oh.

02:30.219 --> 02:31.323
Hm.

02:32.945 --> 02:35.879
Did you consider using a barium
silicate lamp for a

02:35.914 --> 02:38.744
higher spectral range?

02:38.779 --> 02:39.883
-Yeah.

02:45.406 --> 02:47.028
-Is that your mum?

02:47.063 --> 02:48.547
-Yeah.

02:48.582 --> 02:49.721
She wore this the night dad
asked her to marry him?

02:49.755 --> 02:50.963
-That jacket?

02:50.998 --> 02:52.275
-Yeah.

02:52.310 --> 02:53.656
She'd kill me if she
knew I had it on.

02:53.690 --> 02:54.967
-All this football.

02:55.002 --> 02:56.521
Never guess it were yours.

02:56.555 --> 02:58.592
-Oh, it's lovely, Tom.

02:58.626 --> 03:00.766
So, uh, is your mum not here?

03:00.801 --> 03:01.836
-No, she's working late.

03:01.871 --> 03:03.631
But dad will be here soon.

03:03.666 --> 03:04.218
-Good.

03:04.253 --> 03:05.357
-Yeah.

03:21.511 --> 03:23.548
-Ah, very inventive.

03:23.582 --> 03:25.584
Was this when you were
player of the year?

03:25.619 --> 03:26.758
-Yeah.

03:40.841 --> 03:43.878
-Who's damaged this?

03:43.913 --> 03:48.814
-He, um, had some issues with
the subject matter.

03:48.849 --> 03:49.884
-Oh, poor kid.

03:49.919 --> 03:51.714
We need to get him
around more.

03:51.748 --> 03:54.026
Make sure he knows he's welcome
any time, right?

03:54.061 --> 03:56.477
-Mum, for the past two weeks
he thought he was the only

03:56.512 --> 03:57.685
wolfblood in the world.

03:57.720 --> 04:00.067
Give him some time to
adjust, will ya?

04:00.101 --> 04:03.001
-Listen, Rhydian needs to
be around his own kind.

04:03.035 --> 04:06.625
Pack animals don't do
well on their own.

04:06.660 --> 04:07.937
-Here.

04:07.971 --> 04:09.249
Didn't you used to have
a jacket like that?

04:14.840 --> 04:15.945
-Wait for me.

04:18.637 --> 04:20.536
-You're not wearing that to
[inaudible], are you?

04:20.570 --> 04:21.363
-Why not?

04:21.399 --> 04:22.296
-Because it's horrible.

04:22.331 --> 04:23.090
-You might get food on it.

04:23.124 --> 04:24.471
You should leave it here.

04:24.505 --> 04:25.126
-Yeah.

04:25.161 --> 04:25.955
Pick it up Monday.

04:25.989 --> 04:27.267
-Hang on.

04:32.893 --> 04:34.584
-Is your dad still not here?

04:34.619 --> 04:35.861
[beeping]

04:39.520 --> 04:42.074
-He's stuck in traffic.

04:42.109 --> 04:44.629
He'll be here soon I suppose.

04:44.663 --> 04:47.045
-Well, have a great weekend.

04:47.079 --> 04:47.804
-Thanks.

04:47.839 --> 04:48.495
See you around.

04:48.529 --> 04:48.909
-Take care.

04:48.943 --> 04:49.530
See you.

04:49.565 --> 04:50.082
-Bye.

04:50.117 --> 04:50.669
See you later.

04:53.741 --> 04:55.018
[whistling]

05:07.686 --> 05:09.550
[whistling]

05:18.525 --> 05:20.596
-The throw though
was ridiculous.

05:20.630 --> 05:22.425
It's like 20 yards out.

05:22.460 --> 05:25.566
It was like spowwww!

05:25.601 --> 05:27.499
-What happened?

05:27.534 --> 05:28.673
-Oh, mum's jacket.

05:41.893 --> 05:43.929
-Who would do this?

05:43.964 --> 05:45.724
-Mum's going to kill me.

05:45.759 --> 05:47.139
-No one is supposed
to be in here.

05:51.109 --> 05:52.628
Just don't touch anything.

05:52.662 --> 05:53.905
-What happened, sir?

05:53.939 --> 05:56.632
-Someone came back here
Friday night, after

05:56.666 --> 05:59.151
the exhibition closed.

05:59.186 --> 06:00.636
-What about security cameras?

06:00.670 --> 06:03.466
-All we have is a glimpse
of someone running away.

06:03.501 --> 06:08.057
At that speed in the dark, it
could have been anyone.

06:12.441 --> 06:16.652
This school has a
zero tolerance

06:16.686 --> 06:21.588
policy towards vandalism.

06:21.622 --> 06:24.625
The End of Time Disco
is canceled.

06:24.660 --> 06:25.454
-Sir.

06:25.488 --> 06:26.247
-You can't do that.

06:26.282 --> 06:29.872
-Unless the vandal is found.

06:29.906 --> 06:33.013
So if any of you know
anything, now's your

06:33.047 --> 06:34.152
chance to speak up.

06:37.258 --> 06:39.260
-Mum and dad fly back for their
anniversary on Friday.

06:39.295 --> 06:41.021
-Maybe she won't look
in the wardrobe.

06:41.055 --> 06:42.816
-They're having an '80s party.

06:42.850 --> 06:44.645
What do you think mum's
planning to wear?

06:44.680 --> 06:46.095
Her jacket.

06:46.129 --> 06:47.821
This is all your fault for
making me leave it here.

06:47.855 --> 06:49.823
-Well, you shouldn't have worn
it in the first place.

06:49.857 --> 06:50.962
-Stop it, OK?

06:50.996 --> 06:52.791
We just need to find
another jacket.

06:52.826 --> 06:54.448
-Hey, Leek Boy.

06:54.483 --> 06:55.760
Is it true you smashed up the
art room on your first day?

06:55.794 --> 06:56.899
-I knocked some stuff over.

06:56.933 --> 06:58.072
What do you care?

06:58.107 --> 07:00.178
-Where were you Friday
night, Rhydian?

07:00.212 --> 07:01.697
-It's none of your business.

07:01.731 --> 07:03.215
-If you're innocent, why not
tell us where you were?

07:03.250 --> 07:04.665
-Because I can tell you where
he was, because I saw him

07:04.700 --> 07:06.564
skulking around the playground
like a burglar.

07:06.598 --> 07:07.703
-Is this true?

07:07.737 --> 07:08.980
-Why pretend to go home,
then come back?

07:09.014 --> 07:10.775
MALE SPEAKER [OFFSCREEN]:
Yeah, Welshe.

07:10.809 --> 07:11.983
-Unless--

07:17.540 --> 07:18.817
-Hands.

07:18.852 --> 07:19.784
-What do you care?

07:19.818 --> 07:21.233
You think it was me as well.

07:21.268 --> 07:22.269
-Was it?

07:22.303 --> 07:23.753
-No, it wasn't.

07:23.788 --> 07:24.685
-OK, well, I know
you were there.

07:24.720 --> 07:26.238
I seen you at the window.

07:26.273 --> 07:27.861
-Yeah.

07:27.895 --> 07:30.208
I got here and I looked in,
saw you and your parents.

07:30.242 --> 07:32.555
-Why didn't you come in?

07:32.590 --> 07:34.523
-Just--

07:34.557 --> 07:36.594
you know.

07:36.628 --> 07:40.494
I'm not ready for all that.

07:40.529 --> 07:41.806
-All right.

07:41.840 --> 07:43.808
I believe you.

07:43.842 --> 07:45.879
-Thanks a bunch, not
that it matters.

07:45.913 --> 07:47.881
I mean, I'm just going to get
blamed for everything anyway.

07:47.915 --> 07:49.952
-Not if we find the person
who actually did it.

07:53.887 --> 07:54.819
-We found one.

07:54.853 --> 07:57.166
It's that place in Frampton.

07:57.200 --> 07:59.064
I can get dad to drive us
over there tomorrow.

07:59.099 --> 08:01.342
Kara's getting them
to put it aside.

08:01.377 --> 08:02.930
-And how much is it?

08:02.965 --> 08:04.725
-I've got birthday money left
and I can get my allowance

08:04.760 --> 08:05.830
early.

08:05.864 --> 08:06.762
-I've got 30 quid left
in the bank.

08:06.796 --> 08:07.625
-Right.

08:07.659 --> 08:08.660
We'll get back to you.

08:08.695 --> 08:11.560
250 pounds.

08:11.594 --> 08:13.182
[sigh]

08:13.216 --> 08:14.701
-All right, Sherlock.

08:14.735 --> 08:17.048
Now what?

08:17.082 --> 08:18.221
-Follow the motive.

08:21.708 --> 08:23.779
If we can work out why
someone did this, we

08:23.813 --> 08:24.952
could work out who.

08:27.714 --> 08:29.370
If all the best paintings
were damaged, then

08:29.405 --> 08:30.682
the vandal was jealous.

08:33.927 --> 08:36.929
And if one person's work has
been picked on, then the

08:36.964 --> 08:38.241
vandal has a grudge
against them.

08:44.109 --> 08:46.767
Tom.

08:46.802 --> 08:47.941
Who have you fallen
out with recently?

08:52.670 --> 08:54.050
-Mum will go nuclear.

08:54.085 --> 08:56.121
She'll probably send me to that
super strict boarding

08:56.156 --> 08:58.848
school on TV.

08:58.883 --> 08:59.987
I'll have to wear a pinafore.

09:00.022 --> 09:01.092
-Try my new mascara.

09:01.126 --> 09:03.025
A makeover always
cheers me up.

09:03.059 --> 09:05.372
-I don't think a makeover is
going to solve this, Kay.

09:08.444 --> 09:11.758
-Want to bet?

09:11.792 --> 09:12.931
-Psst.

09:15.969 --> 09:20.870
You like a really nice girl,
which is so last season.

09:36.886 --> 09:37.646
-Amazing.

09:37.680 --> 09:38.163
-Spectacular.

09:38.198 --> 09:38.854
-You like?

09:38.888 --> 09:39.993
-Yeah.

09:40.027 --> 09:41.995
-Only 5 quid.

09:42.029 --> 09:44.342
-I don't have 5 quid.

09:44.376 --> 09:45.654
-How much have you got?

09:52.350 --> 09:55.042
-Tell your mates to come and
we'll let you off the rest.

09:55.077 --> 09:56.181
-OK.

09:58.080 --> 10:00.461
-Another 50 like her and your
mum's got a new jacket.

10:00.496 --> 10:01.324
-50?

10:01.359 --> 10:02.774
-You call this pizza?

10:02.809 --> 10:04.465
My chemistry textbook tastes
better than this.

10:04.500 --> 10:06.329
-You just got spoiled
in Manchester.

10:06.364 --> 10:08.677
-What?

10:08.711 --> 10:10.782
-The pizza place where you
and your dad went.

10:10.817 --> 10:11.749
-Oh, yeah.

10:11.783 --> 10:13.302
That was brilliant, you know?

10:13.336 --> 10:14.130
Design your own pizza.

10:14.165 --> 10:14.890
Anything you want.

10:14.924 --> 10:15.856
It was amazing.

10:15.891 --> 10:17.168
-You're in trouble, Welshe.

10:17.202 --> 10:18.376
-Is that right?

10:18.410 --> 10:19.239
MALE SPEAKER [OFFSCREEN]:
You'll see.

10:22.207 --> 10:23.795
-You all should definitely
try out.

10:23.830 --> 10:24.382
It was brilliant.

10:24.416 --> 10:25.694
-Whatever, Tom.

10:29.732 --> 10:31.423
-Look Rhydian, I know you're
angry, but don't

10:31.458 --> 10:32.804
take it out on Tom.

10:32.839 --> 10:35.358
-Tom is a lot angrier
than I am right now.

10:35.393 --> 10:36.394
Just ask him.

10:36.428 --> 10:38.776
-What are you talking about?

10:38.810 --> 10:40.743
-Look at him.

10:40.778 --> 10:42.952
Really look at him.

10:42.987 --> 10:44.160
He's obviously lying
about something.

10:48.440 --> 10:49.787
It's a cold day today.

10:49.821 --> 10:53.514
Nobody else is sweating,
so why is he?

10:53.549 --> 10:55.793
You should be able to pick
out his heart beat.

10:55.827 --> 10:56.932
It's easily the fastest.

10:59.520 --> 11:07.908
[heart beating]

11:07.943 --> 11:10.324
-Are you sure this works?

11:10.359 --> 11:12.948
-Normal humans get hunches
when someone's lying.

11:12.982 --> 11:17.849
I've just learned to do it
better When you have a new

11:17.884 --> 11:21.163
home and a new school every few
weeks, it's really useful

11:21.197 --> 11:22.267
knowing who's telling
the truth.

11:22.302 --> 11:26.755
-Yeah, except Tom
wouldn't lie.

11:26.789 --> 11:27.756
MALE SPEAKER [OFFSCREEN]: It
sounds like you had the

11:27.790 --> 11:30.241
greatest weekend ever, mate.

11:30.275 --> 11:31.035
-Yeah.

11:31.069 --> 11:32.036
Best weekend ever.

11:39.802 --> 11:42.874
You wanted to speak to
me about something?

11:42.909 --> 11:45.877
-I thought you might want to
tell us what really happened

11:45.912 --> 11:47.465
this weekend.

11:47.499 --> 11:49.501
Did you and your dad
have a fight?

11:49.536 --> 11:52.056
-No.

11:52.090 --> 11:53.264
-Tom, I know something happ--

11:53.298 --> 11:54.437
-We didn't fight, Mads.

11:57.302 --> 11:59.788
He just never turned up.

11:59.822 --> 12:04.965
He sent me a text saying how
he couldn't make it.

12:05.000 --> 12:07.312
He's been trying to ring all
weekend, but I told mum I

12:07.347 --> 12:09.211
didn't want to speak to him.

12:09.245 --> 12:10.177
MADDY [OFFSCREEN]:
Did he say why?

12:10.212 --> 12:11.834
-He let me down again.

12:11.869 --> 12:12.835
Does it even matter why?

12:15.596 --> 12:17.806
-They're letting everyone
take their art, so I

12:17.840 --> 12:20.084
got yours and Mads.

12:20.118 --> 12:21.223
-Keep it.

12:40.207 --> 12:42.900
-Sorry, I need to speak
to Rhydian Morris.

12:50.183 --> 12:51.529
-Nice one, Jimi.

12:51.563 --> 12:55.326
-He'll be expelled for sure.

12:55.360 --> 12:56.603
-I don't feel very well, sir.

13:07.027 --> 13:12.239
-You were seen hanging around
on Friday night.

13:12.274 --> 13:13.654
[heart beating]

13:13.689 --> 13:16.554
-I came, but then I
changed my mind.

13:16.588 --> 13:19.315
-So Mr. and Mrs. Vaughan, they
drove you here and back?

13:19.350 --> 13:20.627
-I made my own way.

13:20.661 --> 13:25.114
-You walked from Stoneybridge?

13:25.149 --> 13:26.529
-Don't call me a liar.

13:26.564 --> 13:29.325
[heart beating]

13:29.360 --> 13:31.603
-[WHISPERING] Rhydian,
calm down.

13:31.638 --> 13:32.846
Have control.

13:32.881 --> 13:35.366
Don't let on that
you can hear me.

13:35.400 --> 13:40.267
-What happened on Friday night
was a serious matter, Rhydian.

13:40.302 --> 13:41.441
A criminal matter.

13:41.475 --> 13:42.614
-I didn't do it.

13:42.649 --> 13:43.339
-[WHISPERING] You need
to calm down.

13:43.374 --> 13:44.168
-Shut up.

13:44.202 --> 13:46.032
-I beg your pardon.

13:46.066 --> 13:47.481
-You can't just accuse me.

13:47.516 --> 13:51.313
-I'm simply asking you, young
man, to explain where

13:51.347 --> 13:53.971
you were and why.

13:54.005 --> 13:56.490
I'm trying to help
you, Rhydian.

13:56.525 --> 13:57.422
-[WHISPERING] Keep breathing.

13:57.457 --> 13:58.907
Stay calm.

13:58.941 --> 14:03.083
[door closing]

14:03.118 --> 14:06.880
-Just think about lying in
a green field in the sun.

14:06.915 --> 14:08.192
-What exactly is so funny?

14:08.226 --> 14:09.365
You are trying my patience!

14:14.957 --> 14:17.615
-[WHISPERING] Rhydian,
are you OK?

14:17.649 --> 14:19.479
MR. JEFFRIES [OFFSCREEN]:
Last chance, Rhydian.

14:19.513 --> 14:23.103
Where were you on Friday?

14:23.138 --> 14:24.380
-[sigh].

14:24.415 --> 14:25.312
OK.

14:25.347 --> 14:26.417
What you need to say is--

14:26.451 --> 14:29.247
-I said, I came on my own.

14:29.282 --> 14:32.009
Maddy's parents gave
me a lift home.

14:32.043 --> 14:35.288
Yeah, that's right.

14:35.322 --> 14:36.082
Cal them.

14:36.116 --> 14:36.876
They'll back me up.

14:46.299 --> 14:55.308
[phone ringing]

14:55.342 --> 14:57.310
-Hello?

14:57.344 --> 14:59.174
Mr. Jeffries.

14:59.208 --> 15:00.347
What's the matter?

15:05.421 --> 15:06.664
-It seems you were telling
the truth.

15:10.979 --> 15:13.084
-You cut that a bit
fine, young lady.

15:13.119 --> 15:13.636
-[WHISPERING] Yeah.

15:13.671 --> 15:14.672
Sorry, mum.

15:14.706 --> 15:15.500
Thanks.

15:19.125 --> 15:22.438
-Think about lying
in a green field?

15:22.473 --> 15:23.543
How lame is that?

15:23.577 --> 15:25.234
-It worked, didn't it?

15:25.269 --> 15:26.718
-Yeah.

15:26.753 --> 15:30.067
Well, now Jeffries knows it
wasn't me, it's not a problem.

15:30.101 --> 15:31.240
-Actually, it is.

15:36.073 --> 15:38.109
Tom was the last to leave
the building on Friday.

15:38.144 --> 15:39.524
-Tom?

15:39.559 --> 15:42.769
-His marvelous weekend in
Manchester never happened.

15:42.803 --> 15:44.529
His dad never showed up.

15:44.564 --> 15:46.255
-I told you he was lying.

15:46.290 --> 15:49.672
-And his artwork was the
worst damaged, photos

15:49.707 --> 15:51.295
of him and his dad.

15:51.329 --> 15:53.538
-So talk to him?

15:53.573 --> 15:55.057
Better coming from you
than someone else.

15:59.199 --> 16:01.029
-Couldn't save Leek Boy
this time, could you?

16:01.063 --> 16:02.133
-I didn't need to.

16:02.168 --> 16:03.307
He didn't do it.

16:14.249 --> 16:15.353
-Ultraviolet.

16:21.256 --> 16:25.363
Can you remember Kara's
ultraviolet painting?

16:25.398 --> 16:27.641
The ink was spilled
everywhere.

16:27.676 --> 16:29.609
The vandal must have
trodden it in.

16:29.643 --> 16:31.162
-So they won't have
washed it off?

16:31.197 --> 16:32.612
-Because they don't
know it's there.

16:32.646 --> 16:34.027
-How are you going to check
everybody's shoes?

16:36.512 --> 16:37.341
-The dirt detector.

16:37.375 --> 16:38.480
Show us your shoes.

16:43.657 --> 16:46.039
-Are you just going
to confront him?

16:46.074 --> 16:47.420
-I don't have any choice.

16:47.454 --> 16:49.732
If she gets anywhere near
him with that UV light--

16:49.767 --> 16:50.837
-Show us your shoes.

16:50.871 --> 16:51.838
-Any luck?

16:51.872 --> 16:54.047
-We need to talk about Friday.

16:54.082 --> 16:55.462
What really happened.

16:55.497 --> 16:57.671
-Huh?

16:57.706 --> 17:01.641
-I know you were the last
one to leave school.

17:01.675 --> 17:03.125
-You're kidding me!

17:03.160 --> 17:04.540
You really think I did it
to other people's work?

17:04.575 --> 17:05.540
I wouldn't--

17:05.576 --> 17:06.887
-I'm just trying to help you.

17:06.922 --> 17:13.859
-If you really think it's
me, check it yourself.

17:37.435 --> 17:38.574
Thanks, Mads.

17:42.130 --> 17:43.269
Some friend you are.

18:05.636 --> 18:11.607
-Tom, could we-- you know,
have a chat about Friday?

18:11.642 --> 18:14.300
We could go for a burger.

18:14.334 --> 18:15.232
It's all right.

18:15.266 --> 18:16.371
Your mother knows I'm here.

18:16.405 --> 18:18.304
TOM [OFFSCREEN]: It's
not all right.

18:18.338 --> 18:19.719
You let down again.

18:19.753 --> 18:20.927
You promised me there wouldn't
be any emergencies.

18:20.961 --> 18:22.722
-I know, but this wasn't
hospital business.

18:22.756 --> 18:24.620
It was a family emergency.

18:24.655 --> 18:26.864
-It's your new precious baby's
family, and I'm not, yeah?

18:26.898 --> 18:27.554
-Tom, wait.

18:27.589 --> 18:28.521
Tom, please.

18:32.732 --> 18:35.838
Maddy, I tried to explain.

18:35.873 --> 18:39.221
-You let him down with
a text, Mr. Okinawe.

18:39.256 --> 18:41.465
-We were on our way
to hospital.

18:41.499 --> 18:43.950
Grace, our baby, she was ill.

18:43.984 --> 18:46.194
Really ill.

18:46.228 --> 18:49.783
I didn't want to let Tom down,
but what choice did I have?

18:49.818 --> 18:51.371
And now he won't even listen.

18:51.406 --> 18:54.754
-Why don't you let
me talk to him?

18:54.788 --> 18:56.928
-I don't know where he's gone.

18:56.963 --> 18:58.275
-I suspect I can find him.

19:06.973 --> 19:08.802
[sniffing]

19:19.261 --> 19:21.229
-I thought I'd find you here.

19:29.720 --> 19:32.343
Look Tom, I'm sorry.

19:32.378 --> 19:33.344
I jumped to conclusions.

19:33.379 --> 19:34.345
I shouldn't have accused you.

19:34.380 --> 19:35.622
-Well no, you shouldn't have.

19:39.074 --> 19:41.525
-I spoke to your dad.

19:41.559 --> 19:43.596
Grace was ill.

19:43.630 --> 19:44.873
-No surprise there.

19:44.907 --> 19:49.222
I mean, all he ever talks
about is her.

19:49.257 --> 19:50.396
Grace can smile.

19:50.430 --> 19:51.638
Grace can crawl.

19:51.673 --> 19:52.984
Grace can sit up.

19:53.019 --> 19:53.985
Wouldn't you like to meet
your little sister?

19:54.020 --> 19:54.848
I never wanted a half sister.

19:54.883 --> 19:55.228
All I want is my dad.

19:58.818 --> 20:03.029
-Well, sometimes others
need the people we

20:03.063 --> 20:04.893
love more than us.

20:04.927 --> 20:08.552
I mean, if he had came to meet
you instead of taking Grace to

20:08.586 --> 20:10.278
the hospital and something
had happened--

20:10.312 --> 20:12.935
-Yeah, I know.

20:12.970 --> 20:19.356
It's just sometimes I
need him too, Mads.

20:19.390 --> 20:20.805
-I think he understands that.

20:23.567 --> 20:25.948
Why don't we go back and see
what he's got to say?

20:35.579 --> 20:37.719
-Well, that can't be everyone.

20:37.753 --> 20:41.101
I never saw Kay and her mates,
or Ryan Boswell.

20:41.136 --> 20:43.449
-We're bound to have
missed people.

20:43.483 --> 20:44.588
Let's try again tomorrow.

20:44.622 --> 20:45.830
I'll take this back.

21:06.023 --> 21:07.266
-Push off, Leek Boy.

21:21.141 --> 21:23.903
-I want to know why you did it.

21:23.937 --> 21:25.042
-Get lost.

21:44.648 --> 21:47.478
-Did you do all that damage just
to get me into trouble?

21:47.513 --> 21:48.755
-No.

21:48.790 --> 21:49.929
-You've had it in for
me since I arrived.

21:49.963 --> 21:51.344
You told Jeffries I was
here that night.

21:51.379 --> 21:52.828
-You think everything's
about you, don't you?

21:52.863 --> 21:55.003
Poor little orphan boy.

21:55.037 --> 21:57.143
You know how lucky you are?

21:57.177 --> 21:59.663
No one telling you you're not
good enough, you're a

21:59.697 --> 22:00.733
disappointment.

22:00.767 --> 22:04.909
If that's family,
who needs one?

22:04.944 --> 22:06.048
-Next time you lose
your temper,

22:06.083 --> 22:07.360
smash up your own things.

22:09.880 --> 22:10.984
-Off to tell on me, are you?

22:13.849 --> 22:14.988
-He doesn't have to.

22:19.545 --> 22:20.994
-38 pounds 50?

22:21.029 --> 22:22.927
-Check it for yourself if
you don't believe me.

22:22.962 --> 22:25.689
-All those makeovers and
that's all we made?

22:25.723 --> 22:27.794
-So with our allowances and
the birthday money--

22:27.829 --> 22:30.176
-We still won't have anywhere
near enough.

22:33.869 --> 22:34.698
-Hey, Jimi.

22:34.732 --> 22:36.182
You're loaded.

22:36.216 --> 22:37.839
Lend us a hundred quid?

22:37.873 --> 22:39.496
-What is all this?

22:39.530 --> 22:43.983
-Sorry, but her mum's jacket got
ruined when the art show

22:44.017 --> 22:45.605
got smashed up.

22:45.640 --> 22:46.882
We're going to buy her a new
one, but it's going to cost

22:46.917 --> 22:49.402
250 pounds.

22:49.437 --> 22:50.817
-That is a very sad story.

22:53.233 --> 22:55.857
Here.

22:55.891 --> 22:56.651
Let me help.

22:56.685 --> 22:57.997
Should be enough?

22:58.031 --> 22:58.791
-Thank you.

22:58.825 --> 23:00.171
-Thank you so much.

23:00.206 --> 23:01.103
-This is brilliant.

23:01.138 --> 23:02.795
-Don't thank me.

23:02.829 --> 23:05.798
Thank, [inaudible].

23:05.832 --> 23:07.144
It's all coming out of
his allowance for

23:07.178 --> 23:09.905
the next six months.

23:09.940 --> 23:11.079
Take me to Mr. Jeffries'
office.

23:29.062 --> 23:30.685
-So how's Grace?

23:30.719 --> 23:32.445
-She's improving.

23:32.480 --> 23:35.690
You should come and
meet her soon.

23:35.724 --> 23:37.174
Spend the weekend with us.

23:37.208 --> 23:38.486
All of us.

23:42.041 --> 23:43.145
-OK.

23:44.906 --> 23:46.045
You'd actually have
to turn up.

23:49.289 --> 23:50.567
You still up for that burger?

23:59.196 --> 24:00.162
-Do you think he'll
get expelled?

24:00.197 --> 24:02.268
-It's not my call.

24:02.302 --> 24:05.547
-He deserves it, trying to
get you done for it.

24:05.582 --> 24:07.515
-Jimi's got problems
of his own.

24:07.549 --> 24:08.239
-Like what?

24:08.274 --> 24:10.103
His family's loaded.

24:10.138 --> 24:11.726
-All families have problems.

24:11.760 --> 24:12.899
It's nothing to do with money.

24:15.212 --> 24:16.489
-[inaudible].

24:20.666 --> 24:24.152
-Yeah, maybe I'm the lucky
one being on my own.

24:24.186 --> 24:25.464
-You're not on your own.

24:30.641 --> 24:31.780
-I've got to go.

24:37.165 --> 24:42.170
