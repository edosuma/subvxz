WEBVTT

00:02.635 --> 00:04.398
Good day, Voyager,

00:04.471 --> 00:08.430
and welcome to
A Briefing with Neelix.

00:08.508 --> 00:10.066
lt's a catchy title, isn't it?

00:10.143 --> 00:12.839
l'll be coming to you
each and every day

00:12.912 --> 00:14.971
with news of general interest,

00:15.081 --> 00:18.107
interviews with
our fascinating crew members,

00:18.184 --> 00:19.208
musical performances,

00:19.285 --> 00:21.753
recommendations
for new holodeck programs

00:21.821 --> 00:25.814
and, of course,
previews of upcoming meals--

00:25.892 --> 00:29.089
everything from Hlaka soup
to Zabee nuts.

00:29.162 --> 00:33.258
A Briefing with Neelix
will help you stay informed

00:33.333 --> 00:35.563
about ship's activities,

00:35.635 --> 00:38.195
uh, keep you abreast of
your colleagues' accomplishments

00:38.271 --> 00:41.035
and broaden your knowledge
about a wealth of subjects,

00:41.107 --> 00:45.476
but most of all,
it will make you feel good

00:45.545 --> 00:48.537
because what you see here
will always be

00:48.615 --> 00:50.742
the most uplifting,
optimistic view

00:50.817 --> 00:52.978
of everything
that happens on our ship.

00:53.053 --> 00:55.544
After all,
as your morale officer,

00:55.622 --> 00:57.817
isn't it my job
to bring a little joy

00:57.891 --> 00:59.984
into everyone's day, hmm?

01:00.093 --> 01:03.426
Captain Janeway has agreed
to appear on the show

01:03.463 --> 01:05.761
with regular updates
about the ship's progress

01:05.832 --> 01:07.197
and Commander Chakotay

01:07.267 --> 01:09.701
will commend
outstanding crew members,

01:09.769 --> 01:13.261
so, snap to, and keep those
boots polished to a shine.

01:13.339 --> 01:14.806
You never know
when you might be featured

01:14.874 --> 01:17.399
on A Briefing with Neelix.

01:17.477 --> 01:19.342
Ready, Ensign?

01:19.412 --> 01:20.572
All set, Neelix.

01:20.647 --> 01:23.582
ln just a moment,
an amazing talent.

01:23.650 --> 01:26.483
Ensign Pablo Baytart
will astound you

01:26.553 --> 01:28.214
with his juggling ability.

01:28.288 --> 01:31.621
He'll keep padds, hyposprays,
even phasers in the air

01:31.691 --> 01:32.988
for minutes at a time.

01:33.059 --> 01:35.220
l don't... but before that,

01:35.295 --> 01:39.698
what makes people feel better
than a little romance?

01:39.766 --> 01:42.894
And what Lieutenant
in a gold uniform

01:42.969 --> 01:45.096
was recently huddled
in the Mess Hall

01:45.171 --> 01:46.968
with what crewman in blue

01:47.040 --> 01:49.770
having a very intimate
conversation

01:49.843 --> 01:52.607
over a carafe of Silmic wine?

01:52.679 --> 01:56.240
Well, l'd never name names,
but you know who you are.

01:56.316 --> 01:59.012
Best wishes
to a handsome pair of lovebirds.

01:59.085 --> 02:00.279
And now,

02:00.353 --> 02:04.119
ladies and gentlemen,
Ensign Pablo Baytart.

02:04.190 --> 02:07.353
Well? What did you think?

02:07.427 --> 02:09.918
l'm a Doctor, not a performer.

02:09.996 --> 02:11.930
l don't have time
for such nonsense.

02:11.998 --> 02:13.932
l can see
Hints for Healthful Living

02:14.000 --> 02:15.797
becoming a very popular
segment, Doctor.

02:15.869 --> 02:17.359
l don't think so.

02:17.437 --> 02:19.735
You'd be lifted

02:19.806 --> 02:21.398
to a whole new level
in the crew's eyes.

02:21.474 --> 02:24.409
They'd hang on your every word.

02:24.477 --> 02:27.844
You'd enjoy a popularity,
a celebrity

02:27.914 --> 02:30.075
that you've never known before.

02:30.150 --> 02:31.981
l would?

02:32.051 --> 02:34.576
You don't have
to answer right away.

02:34.654 --> 02:37.987
Just think about it.

02:44.764 --> 02:46.288
Ah! Mr. Kim!

02:46.366 --> 02:47.833
Just the person l wanted to see.

02:47.901 --> 02:48.993
See you later.

02:49.068 --> 02:52.037
Did you watch A Briefing
with Neelix this morning?

02:52.105 --> 02:54.630
Uh, yes. Yes, l did.

02:55.942 --> 02:58.604
ls there something
about the program you disliked?

02:58.678 --> 03:01.772
l'm not sure l care
for all the frosting.

03:01.848 --> 03:03.611
Frosting?

03:03.683 --> 03:04.809
Deck 4.

03:04.884 --> 03:07.079
Recipes, music, jugglers--

03:07.153 --> 03:09.121
it's sort of like
a steady diet of dessert,

03:09.189 --> 03:11.783
which is fine,
but pretty soon, you want

03:11.858 --> 03:13.553
some meat and potatoes.

03:13.626 --> 03:15.116
You do?

03:15.195 --> 03:16.526
When l was in school,

03:16.596 --> 03:18.928
l was editor of the Academy
newspaper for a year.

03:18.998 --> 03:20.932
l monitored subspace
transmissions.

03:21.067 --> 03:23.092
l got reports
on some of the first activity

03:23.169 --> 03:25.296
by the Maquis
against the Cardassians.

03:25.371 --> 03:26.463
l wrote an editorial

03:26.539 --> 03:29.531
about it, and the students
became polarized on the issue.

03:29.609 --> 03:32.339
They debated the pros and cons

03:32.412 --> 03:34.209
and gained an insight
into the entire history

03:34.280 --> 03:36.077
of the political rebellion.

03:36.149 --> 03:37.912
Now, that's
the power of journalism.

03:37.984 --> 03:41.647
What did your professor say
when you told him

03:41.721 --> 03:43.211
you were going
to publish the editorial?

03:43.289 --> 03:45.154
l didn't tell them.

03:45.225 --> 03:47.989
lt's the job of a journalist
to be independent.

03:48.094 --> 03:51.325
Bridge to Mr. Neelix.

03:51.397 --> 03:53.160
You have
an incoming transmission.

03:53.233 --> 03:54.962
l'm heading for my quarters.

03:55.034 --> 03:56.296
Put it through there.

03:56.369 --> 03:57.358
Yes, sir.

04:01.674 --> 04:04.472
Neelix, my friend, how are you?

04:04.544 --> 04:06.910
Laxeth,
you old dilithium scrubber!

04:06.980 --> 04:08.504
lt's good to see you.

04:08.581 --> 04:09.912
Calling to trade me

04:09.983 --> 04:11.814
some of your
ill-gotten goods again?

04:11.884 --> 04:13.181
l promise you
l never want to see

04:13.253 --> 04:16.380
another wheel
of Pendrashian cheese.

04:16.456 --> 04:18.481
Oh, those days are behind me.

04:18.558 --> 04:19.855
l'm legitimate now.

04:19.926 --> 04:23.657
l'm communications master
of a Talaxian convoy.

04:23.730 --> 04:25.891
Communications master...

04:25.965 --> 04:27.592
well, you've certainly
come up in the world.

04:27.667 --> 04:28.634
Congratulations.

04:28.701 --> 04:30.726
Looks like l'll be seeing you
in a few days.

04:30.803 --> 04:31.929
How's that?

04:32.071 --> 04:34.437
We've been asked to rendezvous
with your ship.

04:34.507 --> 04:36.031
We're going to pick up
a passenger.

04:36.109 --> 04:39.840
Passenger?
We don't carry any passengers.

04:39.912 --> 04:42.847
Apparently,
it's a member of your crew.

04:42.915 --> 04:45.509
All l know is
someone wants to leave your ship

04:45.585 --> 04:47.917
and come to work for us.

04:49.000 --> 04:55.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

06:38.931 --> 06:41.559
Just how, exactly, did you hear

06:41.634 --> 06:43.602
that someone
was leaving the ship?

06:43.669 --> 06:47.696
An old friend of mine is serving
with a Talaxian convoy.

06:47.774 --> 06:49.605
He told me they'd be
rendezvousing with us

06:49.675 --> 06:50.835
in a few days.

06:50.910 --> 06:52.138
Janeway to Tuvok.

06:52.211 --> 06:53.143
Yes, Captain?

06:53.212 --> 06:55.180
Could you join us
in my ready room, please?

06:55.248 --> 06:56.215
Right away.

07:01.954 --> 07:04.354
Lieutenant, Mr. Neelix has heard

07:04.424 --> 07:07.325
on good authority
that one of our crew

07:07.393 --> 07:09.793
will be leaving the ship
in a few days.

07:09.862 --> 07:11.124
Naturally, he's curious

07:11.197 --> 07:13.222
about the identity
of this person.

07:13.299 --> 07:15.790
What are the security issues
here?

07:15.868 --> 07:18.666
l don't believe there are
any serious concerns, Captain.

07:18.738 --> 07:21.707
There is no need to withhold
this information any longer.

07:23.476 --> 07:25.910
Lieutenant Paris...

07:25.978 --> 07:28.139
has asked to be
put off the ship.

07:28.214 --> 07:29.374
Tom?

07:29.449 --> 07:30.381
l'm sure you're aware

07:30.450 --> 07:32.281
that he's had
some problems lately.

07:32.351 --> 07:34.012
Well, yes.

07:34.086 --> 07:35.144
He has been disruptive

07:35.221 --> 07:38.054
and often sets a bad example
for the rest of the crew.

07:38.124 --> 07:42.618
But... he seemed so determined
to get those things behind him.

07:42.695 --> 07:45.892
lt means a lot to him
to be respected by this crew.

07:45.965 --> 07:49.264
All l can tell you is that
when he was relieved of duty

07:49.335 --> 07:52.031
he asked me to make arrangements
for him to leave the ship.

07:52.104 --> 07:54.470
l tried to talk him out
of it, but he was adamant.

07:54.540 --> 07:56.474
We detected the Talaxian convoy

07:56.542 --> 07:59.443
and they were more than happy
to get a pilot of Tom's ability.

07:59.512 --> 08:01.742
l can't believe this.

08:01.814 --> 08:03.839
l never thought...

08:03.950 --> 08:06.851
Captain, may l speak with him?

08:06.919 --> 08:07.977
Of course.

08:08.054 --> 08:09.749
He's in his quarters.

08:19.398 --> 08:20.558
Come in.

08:24.670 --> 08:26.501
Hello, Tom.

08:26.572 --> 08:28.597
Neelix.
How's it going?

08:34.347 --> 08:36.280
Not good, it looks like.

08:36.349 --> 08:37.543
What's wrong?

08:37.616 --> 08:40.745
l hear you're leaving the ship.

08:43.456 --> 08:46.550
Good news travels fast, l guess.

08:46.626 --> 08:48.355
Yeah, l figured there was

08:48.427 --> 08:51.487
quite a bit more opportunity
for advancement

08:51.564 --> 08:53.429
on a Talaxian convoy
than there was

08:53.499 --> 08:56.093
on the only Starfleet ship
in the Quadrant.

08:56.168 --> 08:59.433
When did you make this decision?

08:59.505 --> 09:02.770
Truthfully?
Uh, about a minute and a half

09:02.875 --> 09:05.400
after l set foot on this ship
a year ago.

09:05.444 --> 09:08.242
l knew it was a mistake to try
to fit into Starfleet again

09:08.314 --> 09:10.441
and l should have listened
to myself.

09:10.516 --> 09:12.484
A few more months
in that rehab colony

09:12.552 --> 09:15.077
would have been a hell of
a lot better than being here.

09:15.154 --> 09:18.817
Tom, you and l have
had our differences,

09:18.891 --> 09:21.189
but l thought we put
those behind us. l...

09:21.260 --> 09:26.857
l just hope l haven't...
contributed to your decision.

09:28.668 --> 09:30.966
Neelix, no.

09:31.037 --> 09:34.006
This isn't about anybody
except me.

09:36.976 --> 09:40.309
l've done this to myself
just like always.

09:40.379 --> 09:43.007
No matter where l go
or who l'm with,

09:43.082 --> 09:45.175
l make a mess of things.

09:45.251 --> 09:48.914
The unmistakable conclusion
has to be that, deep down,

09:48.988 --> 09:54.551
l don't want any friends
or a family or a home.

09:54.627 --> 09:56.356
Otherwise, l wouldn't
keep sabotaging

09:56.429 --> 09:57.361
the possibilities.

09:57.430 --> 09:59.694
l thought you found
those things here.

09:59.765 --> 10:03.292
l tried, or maybe l just
told myself l was trying.

10:03.369 --> 10:04.927
l'm not sure.

10:05.071 --> 10:07.437
Either way,
it's just not working.

10:07.506 --> 10:10.407
Frankly, l'd like to get out
before l completely destroy

10:10.476 --> 10:11.773
my image.

10:11.844 --> 10:13.402
There might actually be
one or two people

10:13.479 --> 10:15.606
who still have
a good opinion of me.

10:16.682 --> 10:18.479
l'm one of them, Tom...

10:21.153 --> 10:23.087
and l wish you wouldn't go.

10:23.155 --> 10:25.988
Well, l thank you.

10:26.058 --> 10:30.119
But, the truth is, l've always
considered myself a drifter.

10:30.196 --> 10:32.664
You know what that's like,
Neelix.

10:32.732 --> 10:35.633
Freedom to do what you want,
when you want.

10:35.701 --> 10:38.795
No rules to follow,
nobody depending on you, right?

10:55.254 --> 10:57.245
Well, there you are.

10:57.323 --> 10:59.723
l've been waiting
for what seems like hours.

10:59.792 --> 11:01.191
Doctor, what can l do for you?

11:01.293 --> 11:02.885
l want to discuss the details

11:02.928 --> 11:04.555
of my participation
on your program.

11:04.630 --> 11:06.097
l've been giving it
a great deal of thought

11:06.165 --> 11:07.496
and l've come up
with a number of ideas

11:07.566 --> 11:10.034
l think you'll find
quite intriguing.

11:10.102 --> 11:11.763
Well, that's good news.

11:11.837 --> 11:14.271
l-l'm delighted you've decided
to become a contributor,

11:14.340 --> 11:17.275
but l'm afraid l don't have time
to discuss it right now.

11:17.343 --> 11:18.810
But l've already prepared

11:18.878 --> 11:21.870
today's topic: ''How to keep
your nostrils happy.''

11:21.947 --> 11:23.107
That is fascinating,

11:23.182 --> 11:26.242
but l'm afraid
there's a more important story

11:26.318 --> 11:27.717
l have to work on today.

11:27.787 --> 11:30.779
You mean...
l'm not going to appear today?

11:30.856 --> 11:35.156
When you see it,
l'm sure you will understand.

11:35.227 --> 11:37.991
Hmm.
But l will be on tomorrow?

11:38.097 --> 11:40.930
Definitely.
Without fail, l promise you.

11:41.000 --> 11:44.367
Very well, but tomorrow,
l'll want to cover two topics.

11:44.437 --> 11:45.995
l have a most entertaining idea.

11:46.138 --> 11:49.767
''Uncovering the hidden mysteries
of the adrenal gland.''

11:49.842 --> 11:52.106
Fine, fine.
Good-bye, Doctor.

12:06.592 --> 12:08.651
Good morning, Voyager.

12:08.728 --> 12:12.687
l want to tell you
about a friend of mine.

12:12.765 --> 12:16.895
l first met this man
almost a year ago,

12:16.969 --> 12:20.268
and, to tell you the truth,
l didn't like him much.

12:20.339 --> 12:24.867
He seemed a little too cocky,
a little too sure of himself.

12:24.944 --> 12:27.606
A lot of people had questions
about him.

12:29.415 --> 12:31.383
He'd proven he'd pretty much
sell himself out

12:31.450 --> 12:33.816
to the highest bidder,
go wherever the wind blew him.

12:33.886 --> 12:34.875
So people wondered:

12:34.954 --> 12:37.718
Could you trust this person
when things got tough?

12:37.790 --> 12:40.122
Would he stand
side by side with you

12:40.192 --> 12:44.322
or would he let you down
when you needed him most?

12:44.396 --> 12:46.159
But the fact of the matter is,

12:46.232 --> 12:50.999
he proved himself
right from the beginning.

12:51.070 --> 12:54.836
l wouldn't be alive right now
if it weren't for him,

12:54.907 --> 12:57.467
and the same goes
for many of you.

12:57.543 --> 13:00.273
lt took me a while
to realize it.

13:00.346 --> 13:03.213
Like a lot of people,
l was too caught up

13:03.282 --> 13:04.909
in first impressions

13:04.984 --> 13:07.919
to see the truth
that was right in front of me.

13:07.987 --> 13:12.219
l overlooked his bravery because
l was focusing on his brashness.

13:12.291 --> 13:17.923
l ignored his courage
because l saw it as arrogance,

13:18.030 --> 13:20.157
and l resented his friendliness

13:20.232 --> 13:22.894
because l mistook it
for licentiousness.

13:22.968 --> 13:26.734
So while this man
was giving us his best

13:26.806 --> 13:30.867
every minute of every day,
l was busy judging him.

13:30.943 --> 13:32.911
And now, he's leaving.

13:32.978 --> 13:35.879
l'm proud to say that in spite
of my narrow-mindedness,

13:35.948 --> 13:38.781
Thomas Eugene Paris
became my friend.

13:38.851 --> 13:41.479
l'm going to miss him.

13:41.554 --> 13:44.284
No more laughs
over a game of pool.

13:44.356 --> 13:48.486
No more sitting up into
the wee hours swapping stories.

13:48.561 --> 13:50.495
No more complaints
about my cooking.

13:53.032 --> 13:55.000
Good-bye, Tom.

13:55.067 --> 13:57.661
l think l speak for more of us
than you might imagine

13:57.736 --> 13:59.328
when l say
you're going to leave

13:59.405 --> 14:00.770
an empty space when you go.

14:00.873 --> 14:03.671
l hope you find
what you're looking for.

14:23.128 --> 14:26.689
Lieutenant, Operations has
detected a minute increase

14:26.765 --> 14:27.925
in the engine core temperature.

14:28.000 --> 14:28.932
Are you aware of it?

14:29.001 --> 14:30.127
Yes, Captain.

14:30.202 --> 14:32.796
There's a slight imbalance
in the magnetic constrictors.

14:32.872 --> 14:35.102
lt's causing the plasma
stream to overheat.

14:35.174 --> 14:36.368
l have a team working on it.

14:36.442 --> 14:37.807
Keep me posted.

14:37.877 --> 14:40.812
Mr. Neelix, l'm very
pleased with your program,

14:40.880 --> 14:43.747
especially your tribute
to Lieutenant Paris.

14:43.816 --> 14:45.875
Thank you.

14:45.951 --> 14:48.249
Captain, have you decided
who's going to replace Paris?

14:48.320 --> 14:50.254
l have several people in mind.

14:50.322 --> 14:53.155
Baytart is one.
Hamilton.

14:53.225 --> 14:54.419
Captain, do you think...?

14:54.493 --> 14:59.362
l mean, it's possible Tom might
change his mind, to come back.

14:59.431 --> 15:01.831
Maybe you shouldn't
replace him so quickly.

15:01.934 --> 15:05.563
Harry, Lieutenant Paris
made his decision

15:05.604 --> 15:08.539
with no indication that he
had any doubts about it

15:08.607 --> 15:11.041
or that he might change
his mind in the near future.

15:11.110 --> 15:13.271
We have to accept that
and move on.

15:13.345 --> 15:15.905
What's our tactical status?

15:16.015 --> 15:17.277
All systems are functional.

15:17.349 --> 15:18.907
Engineering to Torres.

15:18.984 --> 15:19.916
Go ahead.

15:19.985 --> 15:21.418
We have a problem here.

15:21.487 --> 15:23.284
What is it?

15:23.355 --> 15:25.346
The magnetic constrictors
have lost alignment.

15:25.424 --> 15:28.120
The plasma stream
is way too hot.

15:28.193 --> 15:29.160
lt's starting to infect

15:29.228 --> 15:30.252
the injector valves.

15:30.329 --> 15:31.261
l'm on my way.

15:31.330 --> 15:32.797
We're finished here.

15:32.865 --> 15:34.332
Dismissed.

15:34.400 --> 15:36.527
Lieutenant, if l may...

15:36.602 --> 15:39.298
this sounds like news
of substance to me.

15:41.006 --> 15:42.871
Just stay out of our way.

15:47.313 --> 15:48.280
lt's gotten worse.

15:48.347 --> 15:50.212
l can't get
the injector valves closed.

15:50.282 --> 15:52.512
Antimatter is starting
to seep into the warp core.

15:52.584 --> 15:54.950
Have you tried adjusting
the power transfer conduits?

15:55.020 --> 15:56.351
Yes. No effect.

15:56.422 --> 15:58.754
We have to try to contain
the reaction in the core.

15:58.824 --> 16:02.123
Don't let the PTC temperature
get above 3.2 million kelvins.

16:02.194 --> 16:04.355
lt's at 2.9 million now.

16:09.068 --> 16:11.536
PTC temperature now
at three million kelvins.

16:11.603 --> 16:13.503
We're going to have
to vent some plasma.

16:13.672 --> 16:16.664
lf you vent plasma that hot
through the nacelles,

16:16.742 --> 16:18.300
the warp coils are going to fry.

16:18.377 --> 16:20.208
Better that than a core breach.

16:20.279 --> 16:22.509
Reinforce the structural field

16:22.581 --> 16:25.106
around the power
transfer conduits

16:25.184 --> 16:27.550
and then prepare
to begin venting plasma.

16:27.619 --> 16:31.419
PTC temperature
now 3.2 million kelvins!

16:31.490 --> 16:32.479
lt's cascading.

16:32.558 --> 16:34.389
Get away from that console.

16:34.460 --> 16:35.893
l can stop it from here.

16:35.961 --> 16:37.622
Get away, Jonas!

16:38.797 --> 16:40.765
Computer,
initiate plasma venting.

16:45.170 --> 16:46.228
Are we all right?

16:48.374 --> 16:49.864
PTC temperature is dropping,

16:49.942 --> 16:51.273
approaching safe levels.

16:52.277 --> 16:53.904
We're under control.

16:53.979 --> 16:54.911
Neelix to Sick Bay.

16:54.980 --> 16:56.572
Prepare for emergency transport.

16:56.648 --> 16:58.013
We have three wounded.

16:59.685 --> 17:01.676
This one's not badly hurt.

17:01.787 --> 17:03.618
20 milligrams impedrezine.

17:03.655 --> 17:05.849
Vital signs steady.

17:05.958 --> 17:08.688
Second degree burns
to face and chest.

17:08.761 --> 17:12.527
Treat him
with the dermal regenerator.

17:12.598 --> 17:14.395
Ah. The situation
has been stabilized.

17:14.465 --> 17:16.627
None of the victims
is in danger any longer.

17:16.702 --> 17:18.294
May l interview one of them now?

17:18.369 --> 17:20.338
One of the patients?

17:20.406 --> 17:21.873
l'd think you'd be
more interested

17:21.940 --> 17:24.135
in my assessment
of the medical situation.

17:24.209 --> 17:25.141
Well, l am, of course.

17:25.210 --> 17:26.507
Would you care
to make a statement?

17:26.578 --> 17:27.510
Yes.

17:27.579 --> 17:30.571
The first task is to triage

17:30.649 --> 17:33.140
or to assess
the relative condition

17:33.218 --> 17:34.583
of each of the victims

17:34.653 --> 17:37.417
and then to prioritize
treatment accordingly.

17:37.489 --> 17:38.786
Thank you, Doctor.

17:38.857 --> 17:41.121
l'm sure that will be of
great interest to the crew.

17:41.193 --> 17:42.717
l wasn't finished.

17:42.795 --> 17:44.888
Next, the treatment per se
must be supervised.

17:44.963 --> 17:46.328
Very interesting.

17:46.398 --> 17:49.629
Now, l know the crew would
love to hear a few words

17:49.701 --> 17:52.693
from the man who risked his life
to save the ship.

17:52.771 --> 17:54.363
Would you consent
to an interview?

17:54.440 --> 17:56.635
l was just doing my job, Neelix.

17:56.708 --> 17:58.972
Lieutenant Torres is
the one you should talk to.

17:59.078 --> 18:00.443
Janeway to Neelix.

18:00.546 --> 18:02.241
Right here, Captain.

18:02.281 --> 18:04.579
Could you join us
on the Bridge, please?

18:04.650 --> 18:05.810
l'm on my way.

18:05.884 --> 18:08.045
l'll contact you later
about the interview.

18:12.891 --> 18:15.359
The plasma burst irradiated
the engine nacelles.

18:15.427 --> 18:17.657
The inner layer of the warp
coils was burned away.

18:17.729 --> 18:19.458
Which means
the warp engines are useless

18:19.531 --> 18:21.226
until we can rebuild them.

18:21.300 --> 18:24.428
They're made from a substance
known as verterium cortenide.

18:24.503 --> 18:26.164
Do you know where we
can find a source?

18:26.238 --> 18:27.205
Verterium cortenide.

18:27.272 --> 18:28.204
lf l'm not mistaken,

18:28.273 --> 18:31.401
that's a densified
composite material.

18:31.477 --> 18:32.501
That's right.
lt's composed

18:32.578 --> 18:34.773
of polysilicate verterium
and monocrystal cortenum.

18:34.847 --> 18:36.439
Do you know
of any nearby source?

18:36.515 --> 18:39.450
Let's see.

18:39.518 --> 18:42.578
There's a yellow dwarf
system called Hemikek

18:42.654 --> 18:46.351
with an M-Class planet
quite rich in minerals.

18:46.425 --> 18:47.722
Mining rights belong

18:47.793 --> 18:49.852
to a consortium
of nonaggressive people.

18:49.928 --> 18:51.759
l'm sure we could
make arrangements

18:51.830 --> 18:54.162
to purchase
some verterium and cortenum.

18:54.233 --> 18:55.427
Good work, Neelix.

18:55.501 --> 18:59.904
Captain, message coming in
from the Talaxian convoy.

18:59.972 --> 19:01.269
Put it on screen.

19:01.373 --> 19:03.273
Captain Janeway.

19:03.308 --> 19:04.240
What's happened?

19:04.309 --> 19:06.243
We were attacked
by the Kazon-Nistrim.

19:06.311 --> 19:08.438
Do you have casualties?
How can we help?

19:08.514 --> 19:10.038
We have no serious casualties

19:10.115 --> 19:12.106
and they didn't take
any of our cargo.

19:12.184 --> 19:14.049
The one thing
they were interested in

19:14.119 --> 19:16.519
was your former crewman,
Thomas Paris.

19:16.588 --> 19:19.352
They took him aboard their ship
and then left.

19:19.424 --> 19:21.016
l thought you'd want to know.

19:44.283 --> 19:46.342
Tom Paris...

19:46.418 --> 19:48.545
Hello, Seska.

19:48.620 --> 19:50.918
You're looking
radiantly maternal.

19:50.989 --> 19:55.119
ln another month,
Chakotay will have a son...

19:55.194 --> 19:57.059
or a daughter.

19:57.129 --> 19:59.324
l really didn't
want to know which.

19:59.398 --> 20:01.423
Makes it more interesting,
don't you think?

20:01.500 --> 20:03.331
l wouldn't know.

20:04.803 --> 20:07.931
l have no idea which one
Chakotay would prefer.

20:08.040 --> 20:11.305
He and l rarely see eye to eye.

20:11.376 --> 20:14.777
You've had your problems
with him lately, too.

20:14.846 --> 20:16.507
l know all about
what's happened.

20:16.582 --> 20:19.642
Your sudden inability
to be Starfleet's good boy.

20:19.718 --> 20:21.208
lt's not sudden.

20:21.286 --> 20:23.311
l never really fit in there.

20:23.388 --> 20:26.824
Then ''Lieutenant Tom Paris''
was just a pretense.

20:26.892 --> 20:28.086
No.

20:28.160 --> 20:30.594
No, it was me trying very hard

20:30.662 --> 20:33.062
to be someone
l finally couldn't be.

20:34.066 --> 20:35.431
l never liked you, Tom.

20:37.369 --> 20:39.667
l didn't trust you.

20:39.738 --> 20:42.172
l don't trust you now.

20:42.241 --> 20:45.768
l can assure you
the feeling is mutual.

20:45.844 --> 20:47.243
Fine.

20:47.312 --> 20:50.475
But we might be able
to help each other...

20:50.549 --> 20:52.574
if you're telling the truth.

20:52.651 --> 20:55.449
ls that why you kidnapped me
and dragged me here,

20:55.520 --> 20:57.317
so we can be pals now?

20:57.389 --> 20:59.584
l thought
it might make sense to you.

20:59.658 --> 21:00.886
And if it doesn't?

21:00.993 --> 21:05.862
The Kazon tend to be excessive
in their use of force.

21:05.897 --> 21:07.694
lt's nothing l can change.

21:07.766 --> 21:10.929
But l can promise you'll be
well-treated on this ship

21:11.069 --> 21:13.333
if we decide
we can work together.

21:13.405 --> 21:15.566
What exactly would that mean?

21:15.641 --> 21:17.131
You're an excellent pilot.

21:17.209 --> 21:19.234
We could make good use
of your skills,

21:19.311 --> 21:22.712
and, of course, you have
information about Voyager

21:22.781 --> 21:24.772
that could be quite valuable.

21:24.850 --> 21:27.478
lt seems to me
like you're already getting

21:27.552 --> 21:31.079
a lot of valuable information
about Voyager from somewhere.

21:33.825 --> 21:36.521
Think about it, Tom.

21:36.595 --> 21:42.227
Think about where you want to be
when the Nistrim seize Voyager

21:42.301 --> 21:46.704
and start taking control of
the Quadrant sector by sector.

21:46.772 --> 21:48.433
Just let me know.

22:26.511 --> 22:30.242
Captain's Log, Stardate 49485.2.

22:30.315 --> 22:31.373
ln spite of the fact

22:31.450 --> 22:33.816
that Tom Paris has been abducted
by the Kazon,

22:33.885 --> 22:36.979
we must continue on course
for the Hemikek system.

22:37.055 --> 22:38.647
Something just doesn't
make sense.

22:38.724 --> 22:41.420
l mean, he wasn't off the ship
for a day when the Kazon

22:41.493 --> 22:42.482
attacked that convoy.

22:42.561 --> 22:44.791
How did they find out so fast
that Tom was there?

22:44.863 --> 22:46.626
Maybe someone on the convoy
told them.

22:46.698 --> 22:47.960
A Talaxian convoy

22:48.033 --> 22:49.933
would never let the Kazon
know where they are.

22:50.001 --> 22:51.593
That would be like
committing suicide.

22:51.670 --> 22:53.297
Maybe they came
to rob the cargo,

22:53.372 --> 22:57.308
but when they realized
there was a Starfleet officer...

22:57.376 --> 22:59.742
That wouldn't have stopped them
from taking the cargo, too.

22:59.811 --> 23:01.870
And according to my friend,
Laxeth,

23:01.980 --> 23:04.039
it was a swift,
efficient strike.

23:04.082 --> 23:07.449
lt sounds like they knew
Tom was there

23:07.519 --> 23:10.147
and they came just to get him.

23:10.222 --> 23:11.849
But who would have told them?

23:12.924 --> 23:15.119
One possibility l can think of

23:15.193 --> 23:17.218
is that it was someone
on this ship.

23:17.295 --> 23:18.728
On Voyager?.

23:18.797 --> 23:19.923
Who would do that?

23:20.031 --> 23:22.124
l don't know...

23:22.200 --> 23:25.636
but a responsible journalist
would find out.

23:32.744 --> 23:35.679
B'Elanna, l didn't expect
to find you here.

23:35.747 --> 23:37.112
Are you working the night shift?

23:37.182 --> 23:39.207
l have been since the accident.

23:39.284 --> 23:41.275
What brings you here?

23:41.353 --> 23:43.719
l was wondering
if you could show me

23:43.789 --> 23:47.088
how to access the subspace
communications logs?

23:47.159 --> 23:49.627
Why would you be interested
in the com logs?

23:49.694 --> 23:51.252
Well, just part
of my news program.

23:51.329 --> 23:53.320
Well, l can get you into them,
but then you're on your own.

23:53.398 --> 23:54.729
l'm still trying to bring

23:54.800 --> 23:56.995
the magnetic constrictors
into alignment.

23:57.068 --> 23:58.763
l understand.
Just get me started.

24:04.609 --> 24:06.133
How far back do you want to go?

24:06.211 --> 24:08.076
Oh, maybe a month or two.

24:10.182 --> 24:11.581
Okay, the file's open.

24:11.750 --> 24:13.479
Transmissions are logged
on by date and time.

24:13.552 --> 24:14.484
Anything else?

24:14.553 --> 24:16.817
No, l'll be fine.
Thank you very much.

24:16.888 --> 24:18.913
Mike, we're going
into the computer core

24:18.990 --> 24:21.515
to look over the magnetic
constrictor circuitry.

24:21.593 --> 24:23.322
Hold down the fort.
All right?

24:23.395 --> 24:24.862
Okay, Lieutenant.

24:29.134 --> 24:31.329
Voyager to Mithren.

24:31.403 --> 24:33.667
Mithren again.

24:33.738 --> 24:37.265
Voyager to Kotati...

24:37.342 --> 24:39.333
Are you looking for
something in particular?

24:39.411 --> 24:43.245
l don't know exactly
what l'm looking for.

24:43.315 --> 24:45.146
Something anomalous.

24:45.217 --> 24:46.616
Why?

24:46.685 --> 24:49.017
An incident l'm investigating.

24:50.689 --> 24:52.156
Tell me, Mr. Hero,

24:52.224 --> 24:56.661
if someone wanted to make
a secret subspace transmission,

24:56.728 --> 24:57.695
how would he do it?

24:58.697 --> 25:00.358
Why would you want
to know that?

25:00.465 --> 25:03.696
Oh, l can't be too forthcoming
right now,

25:03.735 --> 25:06.033
but if l find
what l think l'm going to,

25:06.104 --> 25:10.473
well, let me just say
that this ship will be stunned.

25:10.542 --> 25:13.670
A secret transmission, huh?

25:13.745 --> 25:15.508
Well, that would be tough,
Neelix.

25:15.580 --> 25:18.174
There are all kinds of
security routines in place

25:18.250 --> 25:21.219
and any time a subspace
antenna array is in use,

25:21.286 --> 25:24.016
the sensors make a record of it.

25:24.089 --> 25:26.353
l'm not seeing anything
anomalous here.

25:26.424 --> 25:27.914
What about that?

25:27.993 --> 25:28.925
What?

25:28.994 --> 25:30.359
That... gap.

25:30.428 --> 25:34.159
As if some of the log entries
have been deleted.

25:34.232 --> 25:35.927
Well, that's just
a data fragmentation.

25:36.001 --> 25:37.127
l beg your pardon?

25:37.202 --> 25:38.134
lt probably happened

25:38.203 --> 25:39.795
when the plasma
overloaded the system.

25:39.871 --> 25:40.860
Little glitches like this

25:40.939 --> 25:42.702
will be popping up for
weeks, l'd imagine.

25:42.774 --> 25:44.207
Here it is again.

25:44.276 --> 25:45.504
l wouldn't worry about it.

25:45.577 --> 25:48.171
Maybe Lieutenant Torres
can explain it.

25:48.246 --> 25:50.373
There's nothing to explain.

25:50.448 --> 25:54.077
Believe me, Neelix,
you're making too much of it.

25:54.152 --> 25:56.985
Ah! Here it is again.

25:57.055 --> 25:58.750
Gaps in the log entries.

25:58.823 --> 26:02.315
And, frankly, it looks like more
than data fragmentation to me.

26:05.130 --> 26:10.864
The gaps are showing up in logs
entered over the last month

26:10.936 --> 26:13.336
but not before that.

26:13.405 --> 26:14.872
So, there you are!

26:15.006 --> 26:16.769
l've been looking for you,
Mr. Neelix.

26:16.841 --> 26:18.866
Doctor, how can l help you?

26:19.010 --> 26:21.706
You again neglected to include
me in your news program.

26:21.780 --> 26:23.873
lf you remember, l was
to have two segments today

26:23.949 --> 26:25.348
because l was excluded
yesterday.

26:25.417 --> 26:27.214
That's right, that's right.

26:27.285 --> 26:29.913
l've been so preoccupied
with this other matter.

26:30.021 --> 26:31.079
ln the interest of time,

26:31.156 --> 26:33.090
l'm willing to forego
my story on the adrenal gland.

26:33.158 --> 26:35.626
l will concentrate instead
on my latest idea

26:35.694 --> 26:38.925
''The Klingon Glottis:
Friend or Foe?''

26:39.030 --> 26:40.554
That's very interesting,

26:40.632 --> 26:42.497
but we're going to have
to put it off until tomorrow.

26:42.567 --> 26:44.091
That's what you said yesterday.

26:44.169 --> 26:46.660
l'm sorry, Doctor,
but l really have to go now.

26:57.082 --> 26:58.447
All through

26:58.516 --> 27:02.111
the subspace communication logs,
there were these gaps

27:02.220 --> 27:04.484
as though something
had been erased.

27:04.522 --> 27:06.956
We have recently experienced
a plasma overload.

27:07.025 --> 27:08.287
That could easily account

27:08.360 --> 27:10.385
for the anomalous readings
in the logs.

27:10.462 --> 27:12.589
Aha! l knew you'd say that.

27:12.664 --> 27:14.461
Answer this, Mr. Vulcan:

27:14.532 --> 27:17.399
Why would those gaps,
those deletions

27:17.469 --> 27:19.664
occur only in the sub com logs

27:19.738 --> 27:21.706
and only in the last month?

27:21.773 --> 27:23.866
l checked
every log system we have--

27:23.942 --> 27:26.604
sensor logs,
power allocation logs,

27:26.678 --> 27:29.203
warp maintenance logs,
environmental control logs.

27:29.280 --> 27:30.508
They're all perfectly fine.

27:33.618 --> 27:34.846
What are you suggesting?

27:34.919 --> 27:37.752
l believe someone on this ship

27:37.822 --> 27:40.256
has been making
covert transmissions

27:40.325 --> 27:42.088
and erasing the evidence.

27:42.160 --> 27:43.525
To what end?

27:43.595 --> 27:47.258
l don't know,
but l suspect whoever it was

27:47.332 --> 27:49.562
has been communicating
with the Kazon.

27:49.634 --> 27:52.228
That's
an extremely serious charge.

27:52.303 --> 27:53.770
l know.

27:53.838 --> 27:55.533
That's why l've come to you.

27:57.942 --> 28:02.003
Mr. Neelix, l strongly suspect
that your enthusiasm

28:02.080 --> 28:04.275
for your new
journalistic endeavor

28:04.349 --> 28:07.443
is leading you to see villains
where none exist.

28:07.519 --> 28:10.682
However, even the possibility
that someone on board

28:10.755 --> 28:12.848
might secretly be communicating
with the Kazon

28:12.924 --> 28:14.585
deserves investigation.

28:14.659 --> 28:16.627
l will pursue the matter.

28:16.695 --> 28:18.219
And l will help you.

28:18.296 --> 28:19.490
l think not.

28:19.564 --> 28:21.794
This is now a matter
of ship security.

28:21.866 --> 28:24.460
l must ask you to withdraw
and let me handle it

28:24.536 --> 28:26.094
according
to Starfleet protocols.

28:26.171 --> 28:29.607
As a journalist, l have
an ethical obligation

28:29.674 --> 28:32.404
to keep digging
for the facts in this case.

28:32.477 --> 28:34.001
And l have the higher obligation

28:34.079 --> 28:36.912
to keep you from putting
yourself and others at risk.

28:36.981 --> 28:38.608
You will drop this matter.

28:42.253 --> 28:44.380
l see.

28:44.456 --> 28:46.856
All right, l leave it
in your hands.

28:51.129 --> 28:52.494
Good hunting.

28:54.265 --> 28:56.790
''A higher obligation''?

28:56.868 --> 28:59.428
Ha. l'll show him
higher obligation.

28:59.504 --> 29:02.166
He'll have Eskarian egg
on his face

29:02.273 --> 29:04.104
when l get to the heart of this.

29:04.142 --> 29:07.134
lt's the job of a journalist
to be independent.

29:09.180 --> 29:11.705
Lieutenant, l wonder
if you could...

29:11.783 --> 29:13.148
l'm a little busy right now,
Neelix.

29:13.218 --> 29:14.378
What do you need?

29:14.452 --> 29:15.817
l was wondering

29:15.887 --> 29:18.321
if it's possible
to look underneath a log

29:18.389 --> 29:20.289
that seems to have been erased,

29:20.358 --> 29:22.326
see if there's
anything left of it.

29:22.393 --> 29:26.056
Mr. Hogan, could you please
help Neelix out for a minute?

29:26.131 --> 29:28.793
You want to recover
deleted logs?

29:28.867 --> 29:30.528
Uh, that would be ideal.

29:30.602 --> 29:33.093
Well, let me give it a try.

29:33.171 --> 29:35.139
Usually it's possible
to recover data

29:35.206 --> 29:36.400
unless extraordinary
measures

29:36.474 --> 29:38.066
were taken to erase it.

29:41.112 --> 29:43.273
Well, this is strange.

29:43.348 --> 29:45.908
Computer, run a signal
modulation analysis

29:45.984 --> 29:47.281
of this file.

29:47.352 --> 29:49.684
Security authorization required.

29:49.754 --> 29:52.245
Engineering authorization:
omega-four-seven.

29:52.323 --> 29:54.655
Authorization accepted.

29:54.726 --> 29:56.387
Running analysis.

29:58.329 --> 29:59.421
What?

29:59.497 --> 30:02.159
l... can't recover the logs

30:02.233 --> 30:04.098
because these messages were sent

30:04.169 --> 30:06.467
without using
any of the antenna arrays.

30:06.538 --> 30:08.096
How could someone do that?

30:08.173 --> 30:11.836
By sending the transmissions
through the ship's power grid.

30:11.910 --> 30:13.241
The messages were encoded

30:13.311 --> 30:15.802
in the waste energy
from the propulsion systems,

30:15.880 --> 30:17.973
which is
almost indistinguishable

30:18.049 --> 30:19.744
from galactic background noise.

30:19.818 --> 30:21.615
lngenious.

30:21.686 --> 30:23.551
Would there be a way

30:23.621 --> 30:26.852
to determine
who sent the messages?

30:26.925 --> 30:30.326
l'm looking
for signal correlation traces.

30:30.395 --> 30:33.125
They'd indicate a com link
to the EPS conduits--

30:33.198 --> 30:35.223
maybe give us a location.

30:35.300 --> 30:38.235
l don't know if l can...

30:38.303 --> 30:39.429
There.

30:39.504 --> 30:40.903
There's one.

30:43.308 --> 30:48.769
The source of the com link
is on Deck 4, Section 3-C.

30:48.847 --> 30:51.315
Sorry, but l can't get
more specific than that.

30:51.382 --> 30:53.145
Mr. Hogan, l need
your help over here.

30:53.218 --> 30:55.049
Thanks for your help.

30:55.119 --> 30:57.144
l'll check out Deck 4.

30:57.222 --> 30:59.383
Go room by room,
console by console.

30:59.457 --> 31:01.755
l'd look for evidence
of recent deletions.

31:01.860 --> 31:04.294
lf you see any,
run a recovery program.

31:04.329 --> 31:05.387
See what you get.

31:24.849 --> 31:26.976
Computer, activate monitor.

31:27.051 --> 31:29.281
Unable to comply.

31:29.354 --> 31:32.790
Monitor is cleared for
Lieutenant Thomas Paris only.

31:32.857 --> 31:34.518
Override existing clearance.

31:34.592 --> 31:37.789
Engineering authorization:
omega-four-seven.

31:37.862 --> 31:39.887
Authorization accepted.

31:39.964 --> 31:41.932
Files recovered.

31:54.612 --> 31:56.773
Unbelievable.

31:58.116 --> 32:01.381
My friends,
l derive no satisfaction

32:01.452 --> 32:03.317
from what l am
about to tell you.

32:03.388 --> 32:05.913
l know l originally promised you

32:05.990 --> 32:08.220
that l would only bring you
good news.

32:08.293 --> 32:12.923
However, l feel it's important
that you know the truth.

32:13.031 --> 32:17.468
l have uncovered evidence
that casts serious doubt

32:17.535 --> 32:20.504
on the loyalties
of Lieutenant Thomas Paris.

32:20.571 --> 32:23.597
l have discovered secret
communications to the Kazon

32:23.675 --> 32:25.267
that were sent from his quarters

32:25.343 --> 32:27.243
just prior
to his leaving the ship.

32:27.312 --> 32:28.677
Get him up here... now.

32:28.746 --> 32:30.805
...of messages sent to the Kazon

32:30.882 --> 32:33.248
for some weeks
before his departure.

32:36.955 --> 32:39.981
How did you trace those
transmissions to Tom's quarters?

32:40.058 --> 32:41.992
lt was, uh...

32:42.060 --> 32:45.427
l believe it was called
signal correlation traces.

32:45.496 --> 32:48.954
Mr. Hogan was helping me,
and he detected them.

32:49.033 --> 32:50.830
When l looked for signal
correlation traces,

32:50.902 --> 32:52.233
there were none.

32:52.303 --> 32:54.237
That means someone placed
them in the system

32:54.305 --> 32:56.000
after my initial investigation.

32:56.107 --> 32:58.371
What initial investigation?

32:58.443 --> 33:00.377
Captain, what's going on?

33:04.248 --> 33:08.014
What l'm about to say will come
as a surprise to you, Commander.

33:08.086 --> 33:10.919
There has been a spy
aboard Voyager,

33:10.989 --> 33:13.924
but it isn't Tom Paris.

33:13.992 --> 33:15.926
lt isn't?

33:16.027 --> 33:18.689
No. Lieutenant Paris is,
in fact, part of our plan.

33:18.763 --> 33:20.856
Plan?

33:20.932 --> 33:22.456
Some weeks ago, Tuvok
discovered evidence

33:22.533 --> 33:24.023
of covert transmissions

33:24.102 --> 33:26.662
leaving Voyager
through the EPS system.

33:26.738 --> 33:28.535
We realized there was
someone on this ship

33:28.606 --> 33:30.267
communicating
with the Kazon-Nistrim.

33:30.341 --> 33:31.399
However,

33:31.476 --> 33:34.377
we were unable to ascertain
who that person was.

33:34.445 --> 33:36.174
We needed a way
to flush out the spy

33:36.247 --> 33:38.408
and we had exhausted
all conventional means.

33:38.483 --> 33:40.610
That's when
we thought of using Tom,

33:40.685 --> 33:43.313
finding a way to get him
on the Kazon ship.

33:43.388 --> 33:46.915
Are you saying Paris'
insulting behavior,

33:46.991 --> 33:49.084
the gambling,
being late for duty,

33:49.160 --> 33:51.924
mouthing off at me,
was all a ruse?

33:51.996 --> 33:53.463
That is correct.

33:53.531 --> 33:55.260
lt was important that his
decision to leave the ship

33:55.333 --> 33:59.167
appear plausible, so he began
behaving like a malcontent.

33:59.237 --> 34:01.865
And the reason l wasn't let in
on this little plan?

34:01.973 --> 34:03.907
l was the one who recommended

34:03.975 --> 34:06.102
to Captain Janeway
that you not be told.

34:06.177 --> 34:08.543
l suspected that the spy
was a Maquis

34:08.612 --> 34:11.241
and felt it was wrong
to put you in a position

34:11.315 --> 34:13.806
of setting a trap for someone
who had once served under you.

34:13.885 --> 34:15.614
ln other words,
you didn't trust me.

34:15.686 --> 34:21.090
Commander, the simple fact is
we needed a good performance.

34:21.159 --> 34:24.094
l'm afraid we used you
to help Tom provide it,

34:24.161 --> 34:26.562
and you did a damn good job.

34:29.600 --> 34:31.761
Now, it seems Mr. Neelix's
investigation

34:31.835 --> 34:33.895
has made someone nervous--

34:33.971 --> 34:35.598
nervous enough to put a trail

34:35.672 --> 34:38.072
in the computer system
for him to follow.

34:38.141 --> 34:39.473
Could it be Hogan?

34:39.543 --> 34:41.306
l don't think so.

34:41.379 --> 34:43.938
He was just the person
walking by

34:44.014 --> 34:46.574
who Lieutenant Torres
asked to help me.

34:46.650 --> 34:48.846
The spy may be
a little cozy now,

34:48.920 --> 34:51.980
since you took the bait
and pointed the finger at Tom,

34:52.056 --> 34:54.114
but we don't want him cozy.

34:54.192 --> 34:55.920
l'd rather he feel
some pressure.

34:55.993 --> 34:57.221
Perhaps we should
take advantage

34:57.295 --> 34:59.763
of Mr. Neelix's
unintentional blunder.

34:59.831 --> 35:02.857
Exactly. l want you
to keep investigating, Neelix.

35:02.967 --> 35:05.026
Do what you've been doing--
poke around, ask questions--

35:05.069 --> 35:07.060
but let people think

35:07.138 --> 35:10.301
you're not so sure
you were right about Tom Paris.

35:10.374 --> 35:13.343
That would put Neelix in a
potentially dangerous situation.

35:13.411 --> 35:16.141
We would keep an open com link
to you at all hours.

35:16.214 --> 35:18.239
My security team
could act immediately

35:18.316 --> 35:20.910
if anything were to happen.

35:20.985 --> 35:22.384
lt's up to you, Neelix.

35:22.453 --> 35:24.045
This is purely voluntary.

35:31.028 --> 35:34.122
Anything l can do to help,
Captain,

35:34.198 --> 35:38.294
and get Tom home safely,
l want to do.

35:58.856 --> 36:00.346
What did you expect?

36:00.458 --> 36:04.360
...think this has all been about
exchanging holiday greetings?

36:04.395 --> 36:06.192
No, of course not, but...

36:06.264 --> 36:07.629
Here's how it's going to work.

36:07.698 --> 36:10.633
We'll be waiting for you
on a planet

36:10.701 --> 36:11.861
called Hemikek lV.

36:14.872 --> 36:16.965
Well, Tom, it's always good

36:17.041 --> 36:19.009
to have one's
instincts verified.

36:19.076 --> 36:22.409
Clever plan, Seska,
leading Voyager into an ambush,

36:22.480 --> 36:26.246
but even so, this ship
will be outmanned and outgunned.

36:26.317 --> 36:28.785
That's why we have
ground troops on Hemikek

36:28.853 --> 36:30.514
and more ships on the way.

36:30.588 --> 36:33.113
Now, don't you wish
you'd taken my offer?

36:52.944 --> 36:54.878
Thanks for the hospitality.

36:55.913 --> 36:57.244
Go get him!

37:58.542 --> 38:00.874
Lieutenant Torres is waiting
for these interlink sequencers.

38:00.978 --> 38:02.002
Get them to her right away.

38:02.046 --> 38:03.013
Yes, sir.

38:03.080 --> 38:04.012
Excuse me.

38:04.081 --> 38:05.013
Oh, hello, Neelix.

38:05.082 --> 38:06.743
l was wondering if one
of you could help me.

38:06.817 --> 38:08.284
We're a little busy right now.

38:08.352 --> 38:09.546
What is it that you need?

38:09.620 --> 38:12.851
The signal correlation traces
that implicated Tom Paris--

38:12.957 --> 38:15.551
they were added
to the file after the fact.

38:15.626 --> 38:16.752
You're kidding?

38:16.827 --> 38:20.092
So, l was trying to figure out
how that could have happened

38:20.164 --> 38:21.495
and who might have done it.

38:21.565 --> 38:23.055
This couldn't be
a worse time, Neelix.

38:23.134 --> 38:25.694
We're getting everything ready
for rebuilding the warp coils.

38:25.770 --> 38:27.362
Do you mind if l use

38:27.438 --> 38:29.599
the diagnostic terminal
over there?

38:29.674 --> 38:32.802
Go ahead, just don't tap
into any Engineering systems.

38:32.877 --> 38:34.174
l'll be careful.

38:34.245 --> 38:35.177
Torres to Engineering.

38:35.246 --> 38:36.713
Jonas here, Lieutenant.

38:36.781 --> 38:39.249
l need the electrodynamic
load specs.

38:39.317 --> 38:40.875
They weren't with
the other things you sent.

38:40.951 --> 38:41.883
Sorry, Lieutenant.

38:41.952 --> 38:43.044
l'll get them to you right now.

38:43.120 --> 38:44.280
Take these to Lieutenant Torres.

38:44.355 --> 38:45.879
Right.

38:52.063 --> 38:53.121
What's going on?

38:53.197 --> 38:54.630
Bridge to Engineering.

38:54.699 --> 38:56.394
Jonas here, Captain.

38:56.467 --> 38:58.094
l need you to increase
transporter range.

38:58.169 --> 39:00.501
Shunt all available power
to Transporter Room 2.

39:00.604 --> 39:01.536
Right away.

39:01.572 --> 39:03.039
Let me know as soon
as you've done it.

39:03.107 --> 39:04.074
We have an incoming shuttle

39:04.141 --> 39:05.608
and we've identified
human life signs.

39:05.676 --> 39:07.644
lt may be Tom Paris.

39:07.712 --> 39:09.976
Yes, ma'am.

39:15.353 --> 39:18.379
Paris to Voyager!
Paris to Voyager!

39:18.456 --> 39:20.083
Do you read me yet?

39:22.393 --> 39:23.553
Paris to Voyager!

39:23.627 --> 39:26.357
Paris to Voyager!
Come in!

39:26.430 --> 39:28.057
Voyager to Paris.
We hear you.

39:28.132 --> 39:30.430
Captain, change your course
immediately.

39:30.501 --> 39:32.492
The Kazon have ground troops
waiting for you

39:32.570 --> 39:35.368
on Hemikek,
and more ships on the way.

39:35.439 --> 39:37.134
We'll get you out of there
as soon as we can, Tom.

39:37.208 --> 39:38.607
You're still
out of transporter range,

39:38.676 --> 39:40.906
but we won't change course until
we've locked on to you.

39:40.978 --> 39:42.445
l can take care of myself!

39:42.513 --> 39:44.105
Just get Voyager to safety!

39:44.181 --> 39:46.149
As soon as you're on board.

39:47.151 --> 39:49.085
Tom, what happened?
Are you all right?

39:49.153 --> 39:51.178
Lieutenant Paris, report.

39:51.255 --> 39:54.349
Mr. Jonas,
we need that transporter now.

39:54.425 --> 39:55.357
l'm working on it, Captain.

39:55.426 --> 39:58.122
l'm having trouble resetting
the EPS manifold.

39:58.195 --> 39:59.162
Stay on it.

40:01.532 --> 40:03.193
Mr. Jonas, l'm no expert,

40:03.267 --> 40:04.825
but it doesn't look to me
like you're working

40:04.902 --> 40:06.767
on the transporter subsystems.

40:06.837 --> 40:08.702
Neelix, l know what l'm doing.

40:15.179 --> 40:16.407
What did you do?!

40:19.250 --> 40:20.979
What is this force field for?

40:21.085 --> 40:22.484
lt's just a precaution.

40:22.553 --> 40:23.986
Please, Neelix!

40:24.054 --> 40:25.248
Stay out of this!

40:28.759 --> 40:30.989
Tom, can you hear me?
Report.

40:31.061 --> 40:32.824
l'm here, Captain.

40:32.897 --> 40:35.422
We'll be in normal transporter
range in another minute.

40:37.034 --> 40:38.899
Captain... the spy.

40:40.037 --> 40:41.698
lt's Michael Jonas.

40:41.772 --> 40:45.208
He's the one
that sabotaged the ship.

40:45.276 --> 40:47.471
Noted.
Janeway to Tuvok.

40:47.545 --> 40:49.172
Get to Engineering immediately.

40:49.246 --> 40:50.770
lt's Michael Jonas.

40:50.848 --> 40:52.042
On our way.

40:52.116 --> 40:55.415
Shuttle hull starting to breach.

40:55.486 --> 40:57.386
Might not make it, Captain.

40:59.356 --> 41:01.221
l recognize that subroutine.

41:01.325 --> 41:02.883
You're into the weapons system.

41:02.927 --> 41:04.087
You're disabling them!

41:04.161 --> 41:06.425
For God's sakes,
Neelix, back off.

41:06.497 --> 41:07.429
Neelix to...

41:28.619 --> 41:30.450
We're in transporter range,
Captain.

41:30.521 --> 41:32.079
Voyager to Paris.

41:32.156 --> 41:33.555
Tom, can you hear me?

41:33.624 --> 41:35.091
We're energizing now.

41:39.430 --> 41:41.591
Transporter Room 2,
do you have him?

41:41.665 --> 41:43.690
We have him, Captain.
He's all right.

41:46.303 --> 41:47.270
lt's the Kazon ship, Captain.

41:47.338 --> 41:48.635
Return fire.

41:48.706 --> 41:51.004
Janeway to Tuvok,
are you in Engineering yet?

41:51.141 --> 41:52.506
The doors are sealed.

41:52.576 --> 41:53.873
We're working on it, Captain.

41:53.944 --> 41:55.343
Bridge to Transporter Room 2.

41:55.412 --> 41:57.039
Lock on to Mr. Jonas
in Engineering

41:57.114 --> 41:58.376
and beam him out of there.

41:58.449 --> 41:59.677
Aye, Captain.

42:06.891 --> 42:09.416
All l got was his combadge,
Captain.

42:11.629 --> 42:13.119
Captain, we've lost weapons.

42:13.197 --> 42:15.688
lt looks like the phaser
arrays have been disabled

42:15.766 --> 42:16.858
from Engineering.

42:16.934 --> 42:18.424
Evasive maneuvers, Ensign.

42:18.502 --> 42:20.834
Mr. Kim, get those weapons
back on line.

43:21.465 --> 43:23.092
Weapons are back on line,
Captain.

43:23.167 --> 43:24.464
Fire at will.

43:24.535 --> 43:26.366
Yes, ma'am.

43:39.950 --> 43:41.542
Are you injured?

43:41.619 --> 43:42.984
Don't worry about me,
Mr. Vulcan.

43:43.053 --> 43:44.452
l'm perfectly all right.

43:44.521 --> 43:47.285
Unfortunately, Mr. Jonas
wasn't so lucky.

43:47.358 --> 43:49.292
Bridge to Tuvok.

43:49.360 --> 43:51.487
l'm standing down Red Alert.

43:51.562 --> 43:55.123
Well, l'm going to have
plenty of material

43:55.199 --> 43:58.362
for tomorrow's
Briefing with Neelix.

43:58.435 --> 44:00.369
...and fortunately,
l was able to steal

44:00.471 --> 44:02.564
one of the Kazon shuttles
and escape.

44:02.606 --> 44:06.007
An amazing story.
Amazing.

44:06.076 --> 44:08.408
Now, l'd like to say
something more, if l might.

44:08.479 --> 44:10.379
Of course.

44:10.447 --> 44:13.507
Um, l know that l've
been acting like a jerk

44:13.584 --> 44:15.711
for the last couple of months.

44:15.786 --> 44:18.016
Unfortunately,
l had to behave that way

44:18.088 --> 44:19.316
if the spy was going to believe

44:19.390 --> 44:21.381
that l really wanted
to leave the ship,

44:21.458 --> 44:24.393
so l'd like to apologize
to anyone

44:24.461 --> 44:26.725
that l might have offended...

44:26.797 --> 44:29.698
uh, especially
Commander Chakotay.

44:29.767 --> 44:32.133
l gave him a pretty hard time.

44:32.202 --> 44:34.693
Not that it wasn't a certain
amount of fun, mind you.

44:36.373 --> 44:39.501
Well, there you have it,
ladies and gentlemen,

44:39.576 --> 44:41.635
the true hero
of this whole endeavor--

44:41.712 --> 44:44.146
Lieutenant Thomas Eugene Paris.

44:44.214 --> 44:46.910
Well, l'm afraid
that's all the time we have.

44:46.984 --> 44:48.975
Oh, l'd like to apologize
to the Doctor

44:49.053 --> 44:52.079
for not getting around
to him once again today,

44:52.156 --> 44:54.420
but l promise you,
he'll be here tomorrow

44:54.491 --> 44:56.516
with lots of fascinating
information

44:56.593 --> 44:58.356
about the Bolian
digestive system.

44:58.429 --> 44:59.828
Good day, Voyager.
