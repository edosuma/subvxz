<i>Bones...</i>

00:02.024 --> 00:04.058
There's a hacker named
Christopher Pelant.

00:04.091 --> 00:06.827
Where are you?
Pretty much anywhere I want to be.

00:06.862 --> 00:08.529
This guy's killed how many people?
Eight.

00:08.564 --> 00:10.398
<i>This guy is worse than anyone</i>

00:10.432 --> 00:11.999
<i>you and I have ever</i>
<i>come across.</i>

00:12.034 --> 00:14.135
Hello, Temperance.
Pelant.

00:14.169 --> 00:16.003
What do you think happened
to poor Chloe Campbell?

00:16.038 --> 00:17.538
I think you killed her.

00:17.573 --> 00:18.906
Wasn't me.
You know who did it.

00:18.941 --> 00:21.909
Uh, same person
who did 187-05-7932,

00:21.944 --> 00:24.545
and 9224-- they were
all killed by one person,

00:24.580 --> 00:25.646
and I think
she's still out there.

00:25.681 --> 00:26.480
You okay, Bones?

00:26.515 --> 00:27.515
The next explosion

00:27.549 --> 00:28.616
will level the
entire building.

00:28.650 --> 00:30.017
Shoot him, Booth.
What?

00:30.052 --> 00:31.319
Shoot him!

00:34.189 --> 00:35.256
And if anything happens
to me, she'll keep

00:35.290 --> 00:37.458
doing what she's doing,

00:37.492 --> 00:39.760
and you'll never
find out who she is.

00:41.663 --> 00:44.665
(heart beating slowly)

00:44.700 --> 00:46.500
(hissing, whirring)

00:54.910 --> 00:57.178
(echoing):
Who's taken these remains?

01:02.117 --> 01:04.218
Who has these remains?!

01:04.253 --> 01:06.454
Who's been in here?!

01:08.757 --> 01:11.392
(gasps) You shouldn't have
shot me, Temperance.

01:11.426 --> 01:13.127
You'll never
find the killer alone.

01:13.161 --> 01:14.528
You'll never find...

01:14.563 --> 01:16.130
You'll never find
the killer alone.

01:16.164 --> 01:17.798
You'll never
find the killer alone.

01:17.833 --> 01:20.401
You hate me.
You hate me... hate me.

01:20.435 --> 01:23.537
No, I don't! No, I don't!
Give me those remains!

01:23.572 --> 01:25.873
Without me... without me...
you'll never find

01:25.907 --> 01:27.108
what connects the victims,
Temperance.

01:27.142 --> 01:28.876
Where are you?!

01:28.910 --> 01:30.745
Where are you?!

01:30.779 --> 01:32.480
(gasps)

01:32.514 --> 01:33.614
(echoing):
Temperance... Temperance...

01:33.649 --> 01:35.082
(gasps)

01:35.117 --> 01:36.450
Temperance, Temperance,
Temperance, Temperance...

01:36.485 --> 01:37.718
(Brennan shrieks)

01:37.753 --> 01:39.453
Temperance, Temperance,
Temperance,

01:39.488 --> 01:40.955
Temperance, Temperance...

01:42.791 --> 01:45.459
(screaming)

01:47.296 --> 01:49.664
(gasping)

01:49.698 --> 01:51.732
(gasps)

01:51.767 --> 01:54.235
(clinking,
clattering, rattling)

01:58.473 --> 02:00.274
(screaming)

02:02.377 --> 02:05.446
(screaming): No!
What? What is it?! What?

02:05.480 --> 02:07.014
What?

02:07.049 --> 02:09.616
It was Pelant, Booth.

02:09.651 --> 02:11.786
Oh. Again?

02:11.820 --> 02:13.754
He had the evidence,
all the bones,

02:13.789 --> 02:15.823
and then I was buried.

02:15.857 --> 02:18.326
It was a dream, right?
He was laughing at me, Booth.

02:18.360 --> 02:18.860
What?

02:18.868 --> 02:21.116
He said that I would
never find the Ghost Killer.

02:21.363 --> 02:23.264
Pelant is dead, right?

02:23.298 --> 02:25.866
I will find the
killer, Booth. I will.

02:25.901 --> 02:27.802
Okay, all right,
I know you will.

02:27.836 --> 02:29.637
It's just,
it was a dream, okay?

02:29.671 --> 02:31.405
You need to get
some rest, all right?

02:31.440 --> 02:33.674
Rest. Come on.
Okay.

02:33.709 --> 02:36.110
Come here.
Okay. Hold me.

02:36.144 --> 02:38.612
Okay... All right...
I got you.

02:38.647 --> 02:40.181
Tighter.
All right.

02:40.215 --> 02:42.717
I'm right here.
It's okay. Shh.

02:42.751 --> 02:44.752
I'm right here.

02:44.786 --> 02:46.487
BRENNAN: I don't understand
why Cam won't believe

02:46.521 --> 02:48.489
the serial killer is real.

02:48.523 --> 02:50.558
Well, it's 'cause there's no
evidence that they're linked.

02:50.592 --> 02:52.293
I mean, there's
nothing conclusive.

02:52.327 --> 02:54.729
Which is why she should
keep the case open.

02:54.763 --> 02:56.697
I need the resources.

02:56.732 --> 03:00.000
You know, you have to admit,

03:00.035 --> 03:01.836
I mean, from the outside,
it does look like

03:01.870 --> 03:04.038
um, Pelant was just,
you know, playing you.

03:04.072 --> 03:06.107
Is that what you believe?

03:06.141 --> 03:07.641
Look, I mean, come on.

03:07.676 --> 03:09.076
You've been poring
over this case for months,

03:09.111 --> 03:10.678
and you haven't come up
with anything.

03:10.712 --> 03:13.314
We can't just, you know,
launch an investigation

03:13.348 --> 03:14.682
on a ghost.

03:14.716 --> 03:16.016
So you don't believe me?

03:16.051 --> 03:17.184
No, it's not that.
I just...

03:17.219 --> 03:18.886
You know what?

03:18.920 --> 03:20.554
I don't want to argue.
It's a beautiful day, huh?

03:20.589 --> 03:23.190
I'm gonna go
get the paper.

03:23.225 --> 03:25.626
(dog barking, birds singing)

03:25.660 --> 03:27.661
Bones, you expecting a package?

03:27.696 --> 03:28.796
No. Why?

03:28.830 --> 03:30.998
Well... one here.

03:37.706 --> 03:40.674
Oh!

03:40.709 --> 03:43.778
No. Wow.

03:47.315 --> 03:51.385
What kind of
sick joke is this?

03:51.420 --> 03:53.788
Someone took great
care in packaging

03:53.822 --> 03:55.256
these remains.

03:55.290 --> 03:56.791
There's a note.

04:02.230 --> 04:05.132
"Please find out
what really happened to me."

BRENNAN: <i>Based on the shape</i>
<i>of the frontal bone,</i>

04:17.612 --> 04:20.014
the narrow nasal aperture
and the size of the mandible,

04:20.048 --> 04:21.515
the victim was
a Caucasian female.

04:21.550 --> 04:23.117
Aren't you

04:23.151 --> 04:24.518
even the least bit freaked out

04:24.553 --> 04:26.720
that these remains were sent
to your house?

04:26.755 --> 04:28.923
I'm the best forensic
anthropologist in the country.

04:28.957 --> 04:30.925
Wouldn't you want me
examining your remains?

04:30.959 --> 04:32.493
SAROYAN:
I think Angela was

04:32.527 --> 04:34.295
referring more to the mysterious
nature of the delivery.

04:34.329 --> 04:36.263
HODGINS: And the fact
that it was to your home,

04:36.298 --> 04:37.965
not the lab.
BRENNAN: No.

04:37.999 --> 04:39.266
There's too much red tape here.

04:39.301 --> 04:41.068
They may not have
even made it to me.

04:41.102 --> 04:42.503
SAROYAN:
Desiccated skin,

04:42.537 --> 04:45.773
soil... this person was interred
at least a decade.

04:45.807 --> 04:48.642
I'll see what particulates
I can get off this.

04:48.677 --> 04:50.444
Whoa, did you sleep
in those clothes?

04:50.479 --> 04:52.213
What? No.

04:52.247 --> 04:55.149
Uh, apologies, uh,
for being late.

04:55.183 --> 04:56.684
Why are you even here?

04:56.718 --> 04:58.219
I called him when I thought

04:58.253 --> 04:59.787
we might be dealing
with archaeological remains.

04:59.821 --> 05:02.323
Ten years does not classify
these as archaeological.

05:02.357 --> 05:03.958
Well, I'm already here,
so I might as well help out.

05:03.992 --> 05:05.960
I don't need another
forensic anthropologist.

05:05.994 --> 05:07.495
What I need
is an intern.

05:07.529 --> 05:08.696
None of whom are available,

05:08.730 --> 05:09.970
and you need help, Dr. Brennan.

05:09.998 --> 05:11.165
So, boss me around.

05:11.199 --> 05:12.399
I'm ready.

05:12.434 --> 05:14.301
Clean these.

05:22.177 --> 05:25.579
SWEETS: No postmark?
No fingerprints?

05:25.614 --> 05:27.381
It's no surprise--
anyone who digs someone up

05:27.415 --> 05:28.883
and delivers them like takeout--

05:28.917 --> 05:30.243
of course they're going
to be careful, Sweets.

05:30.244 --> 05:30.968
You okay?

05:30.969 --> 05:33.254
No, I'm not okay,
okay, Sweets? I'm not.

05:33.255 --> 05:34.722
Someone delivered
a dead body to my house.

05:34.756 --> 05:36.123
How can I be okay?

05:36.157 --> 05:38.259
Right. Sorry.
It's just, it seems...

05:38.293 --> 05:39.693
And Bones is having
nightmares again.

05:39.728 --> 05:41.462
Oh.
Yeah.

05:41.496 --> 05:43.163
She thinks there's another
serial killer out there.

05:43.198 --> 05:44.765
Because that's what Pelant
told her before he died?

05:44.799 --> 05:45.199
Yes.

05:45.224 --> 05:47.184
He just wanted her to
think that he was necessary.

05:47.235 --> 05:49.703
Right? And she feels the need
to prove that he's not.

05:49.738 --> 05:52.473
Okay, Pelant is dead.
The guy is dead.

05:52.507 --> 05:54.108
Why can't anyone
just accept that?

05:54.142 --> 05:55.876
I understand.
Okay, then, help me with the case.

05:55.911 --> 05:57.511
All right, look at the case.

05:57.546 --> 05:59.213
Maybe it'll take Bones's mind
off this craziness.

05:59.247 --> 06:02.883
Okay. Well, the remains are
painstakingly wrapped in cloth.

06:02.918 --> 06:04.585
Right? And the note implies

06:04.619 --> 06:06.287
that the truth of her
death was never known, so,

06:06.321 --> 06:07.601
whoever did this took a big risk

06:07.622 --> 06:09.356
because they care
about the victim.

06:09.391 --> 06:11.492
But how do you know
that this is not some psycho

06:11.526 --> 06:12.927
playing some sick games
with her?

06:12.961 --> 06:15.663
Unfortunately, we don't.

06:53.867 --> 06:55.501
SAROYAN:
Wasn't she a sailing champion?

06:55.536 --> 06:57.503
MONTENEGRO:
Yeah. The Coast Guard found

06:57.538 --> 06:59.739
Lana Brewster's
partially sunken boat.

06:59.773 --> 07:02.742
SAROYAN: Well, it's hard
to miss a boat that big.

07:02.776 --> 07:04.777
Well, she wasn't on
her racing boat that day.

07:04.812 --> 07:08.681
She had taken out
her regular, everyday boat.

07:08.715 --> 07:10.149
Multiple boats. Must be nice.

07:10.184 --> 07:12.251
Her body was found
washed up on the rocks

07:12.286 --> 07:14.587
a couple days later.

07:14.621 --> 07:16.389
EDISON: So, lots of
postmortem damage

07:16.423 --> 07:18.658
from wave action, fish, rocks.

07:18.692 --> 07:20.526
This solo round-the-world race
she took,

07:21.862 --> 07:23.629
It began in Newport,
Rhode Island,

07:23.664 --> 07:26.532
and made stops in Cape Town,
Sydney, and Rio.

07:26.567 --> 07:29.735
It's an amazing achievement
until you consider

07:29.770 --> 07:31.370
that it doesn't
actually achieve anything.

07:31.405 --> 07:32.805
It was inspirational.

07:32.840 --> 07:35.942
She was a hero for millions
of teenage girls.

07:35.976 --> 07:37.210
I'm seeing a
remodeled fracture

07:37.244 --> 07:38.544
to the victim's
right tibia.

07:38.579 --> 07:41.647
The break didn't properly heal.

07:41.682 --> 07:43.115
Oh, yes, that happened
during the race.

07:43.150 --> 07:44.851
She set it herself
and then continued racing.

07:44.885 --> 07:46.452
How do you
know that?

07:46.486 --> 07:48.254
It was kind of a big deal
at the time, sweetie.

07:48.288 --> 07:50.423
SAROYAN: Lana Brewster
accomplished this crazy,

07:50.457 --> 07:54.260
inspirational, round-the-world
race, and then dies

07:54.294 --> 07:55.795
a few months later during

07:55.829 --> 07:57.930
an afternoon sail
in calm weather?

07:57.965 --> 08:00.066
It doesn't really
make sense.

08:13.347 --> 08:15.181
Hey, I found these lodged

08:15.215 --> 08:17.350
in the skin around
the victim's wrist.

08:17.384 --> 08:18.684
Some kind of fiber.

08:18.719 --> 08:20.219
Well, she was
buried in silk,

08:20.254 --> 08:22.088
and the lining of
the coffin was satin.

08:22.122 --> 08:23.623
This is neither.

08:23.657 --> 08:25.858
And I'm seeing pores
and follicle spaces.

08:25.893 --> 08:27.526
Leather?
Yeah. And judging

08:27.561 --> 08:30.429
by the film filling the pores,
this is treated leather.

08:30.464 --> 08:32.097
Leather on the wrist...

08:32.131 --> 08:35.134
Hey, were leather string
bracelets a thing in 1995?

08:35.168 --> 08:36.702
I don't know but it's not on

08:36.736 --> 08:38.236
the list of materials interred
with her.

08:38.272 --> 08:40.139
And it wasn't an
open casket funeral,

08:40.173 --> 08:41.640
so it couldn't have
been tossed in

08:41.674 --> 08:42.975
at the last minute.
All right.

08:43.010 --> 08:45.278
Well, there's
something else, too.

08:45.312 --> 08:48.247
Traces of trillium
pusillum pollen

08:48.282 --> 08:51.517
on both the box
and the victim's bones.

08:51.551 --> 08:53.786
It still contains
live cytoplasm.

08:53.820 --> 08:56.522
So it was deposited after the
body was removed from the grave.

08:56.556 --> 08:58.858
Yeah. And since there's
no trillium in the cemetery,

08:58.892 --> 09:00.960
then the remains must have
been brought somewhere else

09:00.994 --> 09:02.728
before dropped off
at Booth and Brennan's.

09:02.763 --> 09:05.197
Okay, well, do that thing
where you figure out

09:05.232 --> 09:06.666
where stuff comes from.

09:06.700 --> 09:08.768
You're so lucky
I know what you mean.

09:10.170 --> 09:11.671
(scoffs)

09:17.077 --> 09:19.779
Somebody dug up my sister?

09:19.813 --> 09:21.280
Yeah, and delivered
her remains

09:21.315 --> 09:23.316
to a forensic anthropologist
who works for the FBI.

09:23.350 --> 09:25.785
Well, who would do that?

09:25.819 --> 09:27.520
We were hoping
you could help us with that.

09:27.554 --> 09:29.188
Well, I haven't got a clue.

09:29.222 --> 09:31.324
We think that whoever
did this loved your sister

09:31.358 --> 09:32.792
and wanted the authorities

09:32.826 --> 09:33.859
to reopen her murder
investigation.

09:33.894 --> 09:35.528
Listen, I know where

09:35.562 --> 09:37.897
you're going with this,
but I'm just not that guy.

09:37.931 --> 09:39.098
You're her brother.

09:39.132 --> 09:40.633
You're her only living relative.

09:40.667 --> 09:42.101
I barely knew Lana,

09:42.135 --> 09:45.037
and what I did know
I didn't really like.

09:45.072 --> 09:46.072
Why?

09:46.106 --> 09:47.440
Looking back,

09:47.474 --> 09:52.144
maybe I was petty,
but Lana was famous--

09:52.179 --> 09:54.747
magazine covers,
TV appearances--

09:54.781 --> 09:56.215
and my parents loved that.

09:56.249 --> 09:59.051
But I was just a regular kid,

09:59.086 --> 10:02.755
so I was nobody to them.

10:02.789 --> 10:07.159
Can you think of anybody
who does have strong feelings

10:07.194 --> 10:09.128
for your sister?

10:09.162 --> 10:11.297
According to my parents,
everybody.

10:11.331 --> 10:14.200
Everybody in
the whole damn world.

10:14.234 --> 10:15.735
She sailed
around the world alone.

10:15.769 --> 10:17.670
What's not to love?

10:21.141 --> 10:22.742
Okay, well,

10:22.776 --> 10:25.911
whoever exhumed your sister's
remains left a note.

10:29.883 --> 10:32.451
"Please find out
what really happened to me."

10:32.486 --> 10:34.253
Now, obviously,
this person doesn't think

10:34.287 --> 10:36.389
that your sister just drowned.

10:42.462 --> 10:44.430
I think there was a boy.

10:44.464 --> 10:46.665
A boyfriend?

10:46.700 --> 10:48.801
I heard my parents
talking about it.

10:48.835 --> 10:51.771
They didn't like him.

10:53.740 --> 10:55.474
Do you know this boy's name?

10:55.509 --> 10:56.942
No.

10:56.977 --> 10:59.979
When they saw I was there,
they stopped talking...

11:00.013 --> 11:02.915
like always.

11:30.544 --> 11:33.145
♪

11:36.316 --> 11:40.219
I have Lana Brewster's
original autopsy report.

11:40.253 --> 11:41.654
Any surprises?

11:41.688 --> 11:42.655
Yes.

11:42.689 --> 11:44.256
It was utterly incompetent.

11:44.291 --> 11:47.159
Very little detail.
She died of drowning.

11:47.194 --> 11:48.794
EDISON: There's practically
no mention of broken bones,

11:48.829 --> 11:51.163
no cataloguing
of tissue damage from fish.

11:51.198 --> 11:53.099
Or the traces of leather
found on both her wrists.

11:53.133 --> 11:54.033
She was bound?

11:54.058 --> 11:55.634
There's nothing in here
about that either.

11:55.635 --> 11:57.236
Lana Brewster was
a public figure.

11:57.270 --> 11:59.772
How could the medical examiner
escape scrutiny?

11:59.806 --> 12:01.006
EDISON:
The little bone damage

12:01.041 --> 12:02.608
she did catalogue was listed

12:02.642 --> 12:04.944
as postmortem,
when it's obviously perimortem.

12:04.978 --> 12:07.513
Whoever sent you these remains
was right to do so.

12:07.547 --> 12:10.316
Lana Brewster was murdered.

12:19.414 --> 12:22.198
Cam says the medical examiner
working on Lana's case

12:22.199 --> 12:24.668
wasn't just negligent,
but that she lied

12:24.702 --> 12:26.570
about Lana's cause of death.

12:26.604 --> 12:27.871
Why did she cover up
the murder?

12:27.905 --> 12:29.606
Money, it seems.

12:29.640 --> 12:31.741
Before the Brewster case,
Leslie Dollinger was

12:31.776 --> 12:33.710
just a temp medical examiner,

12:33.744 --> 12:35.812
brought in when the backlog
got to be too much.

12:35.846 --> 12:37.614
And Lana Brewster was
the last case she worked on?

12:37.648 --> 12:39.649
Yeah, before she
started that case,

12:39.684 --> 12:41.851
she had $2,000 to her name.

12:41.886 --> 12:43.553
After she released the report

12:43.588 --> 12:46.189
ruling the death accidental,

12:46.223 --> 12:47.991
she received
a $1.9 million transfer

12:48.025 --> 12:49.659
into a brokerage account
in her name.

12:49.694 --> 12:50.927
Wow!

12:50.962 --> 12:53.063
Yeah. After that,
she never worked again.

12:53.097 --> 12:54.831
She took off to Costa Rica.

12:54.865 --> 12:56.466
Well, hey, we have
an extradition treaty with them.

12:56.500 --> 12:57.701
If we can show collusion...

12:57.735 --> 12:59.035
The only way you're gonna talk

12:59.070 --> 13:00.437
to Leslie Dollinger
is through a psychic.

13:00.471 --> 13:01.705
She died of an aneurysm

13:01.739 --> 13:03.373
eight years ago.

13:03.407 --> 13:05.108
Well, do we know
who paid her off?

13:05.142 --> 13:06.676
I'm working on it.

13:10.147 --> 13:12.282
(footsteps approaching)

13:12.316 --> 13:13.883
Bones?

13:13.918 --> 13:15.819
Been waiting outside
in the car for a half an hour.

13:15.853 --> 13:18.388
You said you'd be right out.
Oh, sorry.

13:18.422 --> 13:21.358
I... I lost track of time.

13:21.392 --> 13:23.460
This isn't the Lana Brewster case, is it?
No.

13:23.494 --> 13:24.861
It's a serial killer.

13:24.895 --> 13:26.696
The markings on this sternum

13:26.731 --> 13:28.031
are very similar

13:28.065 --> 13:30.200
to the markings on this one.
"Similar."

13:30.234 --> 13:33.737
That's never been good enough
for you before.

13:35.840 --> 13:37.641
I don't want to argue, Booth.

13:37.675 --> 13:39.075
I don't want
to fight either.

13:39.110 --> 13:40.076
But, you know, I'm...

13:40.111 --> 13:41.511
I'm concerned about you.

13:41.545 --> 13:43.113
I mean, you're having
more nightmares.

13:43.147 --> 13:44.714
No, I'm used to them.

13:44.749 --> 13:46.783
Neuropsychologists now think

13:46.817 --> 13:48.718
that it's the mind
excreting feelings

13:48.753 --> 13:51.554
and information that
it can't process awake.

13:51.589 --> 13:53.089
And I think you're obsessed.

13:53.124 --> 13:54.991
You're so obsessed
you don't even know

13:55.026 --> 13:57.961
how to shut it down,
even when you're asleep.

13:59.664 --> 14:00.964
So you don't believe me?

14:00.998 --> 14:02.198
Look, I want to.

14:02.233 --> 14:04.267
But where's the evidence
that links them?

14:04.301 --> 14:05.335
Real evidence.

14:05.369 --> 14:06.636
Hard evidence.

14:06.671 --> 14:09.172
I learned that from you.

14:09.206 --> 14:10.607
Do you think I'm crazy?

14:10.641 --> 14:13.109
Yeah, a little.

14:13.144 --> 14:15.578
I do. This is not you.

14:15.613 --> 14:17.113
No, there's a link.
I will find it.

14:17.148 --> 14:18.782
That's fine.
Tickle the bones,

14:18.816 --> 14:21.117
and do whatever it is
that you do.

14:21.152 --> 14:22.919
But do it how <i>you</i> do it.

14:22.953 --> 14:25.655
All right?
Don't let Pelant call the shots.

14:25.690 --> 14:28.958
All right? Don't keep him alive.

14:28.993 --> 14:32.429
Otherwise you're never
gonna find the answers.

14:34.465 --> 14:37.500
Let's go home now, okay?

14:41.605 --> 14:44.708
The Ghost Killer's gonna
be here in the morning.

14:49.313 --> 14:52.649
Okay, I'll put these away.

15:00.891 --> 15:02.258
(water running)

15:02.293 --> 15:03.860
Dr. Edison?
(yells)

15:03.894 --> 15:05.862
Oh, shoot! Dr. Saroyan.

15:05.896 --> 15:09.532
The security guard just told me
that you slept here last night.

15:09.567 --> 15:12.402
Uh...

15:12.436 --> 15:13.937
Can I get a towel?

15:13.971 --> 15:15.338
Uh, it's-it's chilly.

15:15.372 --> 15:17.173
I can see.

15:18.609 --> 15:21.010
Employees are not allowed
to use the facilities

15:21.045 --> 15:23.480
as a second home, Dr. Edison.

15:23.514 --> 15:24.948
I wasn't. I wasn't.

15:24.982 --> 15:26.416
Um, I just worked late.
That's all.

15:26.450 --> 15:28.118
Assuming I believe you,

15:28.152 --> 15:29.221
you should manage
your time better.

15:29.246 --> 15:30.086
Y-You're right.

15:30.087 --> 15:31.554
I mean, sometimes I just get lost...
That doesn't

15:31.589 --> 15:32.910
explain sleeping here.
Well, I had

15:32.923 --> 15:34.758
a lot of work,
so I might have dozed a bit.

15:34.792 --> 15:36.226
You've been wrinkled
and disheveled for two days.

15:36.260 --> 15:37.761
You're never wrinkled
and disheveled.

15:37.795 --> 15:40.096
Would you like an explanation?

15:40.131 --> 15:41.197
No.

15:41.232 --> 15:42.265
Really?
Whatever it is,

15:42.299 --> 15:43.266
will be complicated

15:43.300 --> 15:44.300
and none of my business.

15:44.335 --> 15:46.469
All I want is for you to follow

15:46.504 --> 15:48.071
the rules handed down
by the Jeffersonian board,

15:48.105 --> 15:49.272
so I don't have to fire you.

15:49.306 --> 15:50.640
Yes, sure, yes.

15:50.674 --> 15:52.515
Now put on that wrinkled
shirt and get to work.

16:04.688 --> 16:06.890
Jealousy is always a
good motive for murder.

16:06.924 --> 16:08.658
There was another
sailor that competed

16:08.692 --> 16:10.160
against Lana for the Paxton Cup.

16:10.194 --> 16:11.961
They were contemporaries.
I remember this.

16:11.996 --> 16:14.898
It was, um, Erika something.

16:14.932 --> 16:16.499
Yeah, Erika Stamp.
Erika Stamp.

16:16.534 --> 16:18.034
How did you know that?
I used to sail.

16:18.068 --> 16:20.236
Erika Stamp, she actually won,
didn't she?

16:20.271 --> 16:21.538
Yeah.
I never knew you sailed.

16:21.572 --> 16:23.540
Yeah, I was a rich kid,
you know?

16:23.574 --> 16:26.276
We had to sail and have at least
one girlfriend named Muffy.

16:26.310 --> 16:29.112
It's in the charter.
Erika did win, but then

16:29.146 --> 16:30.580
the cup was taken away from her
and given to Lana Brewster,

16:30.614 --> 16:31.714
who came in second.

16:31.749 --> 16:33.550
I remember this.
Erika cheated.

16:33.584 --> 16:34.784
Muffy?
Yeah.

16:34.819 --> 16:36.052
I dumped her for Binky.

16:36.086 --> 16:38.688
Now, Binky, Binky was hot.
Oh, my God.

16:38.722 --> 16:40.223
I am so disoriented right now.

16:40.257 --> 16:41.257
SWEETS:
I got to admit,

16:41.292 --> 16:43.226
I am, too. It says here

16:43.260 --> 16:44.460
that Lana was actually the one

16:44.495 --> 16:46.329
that reported
Erika for cheating.

16:46.363 --> 16:47.931
Erika never recovered.

16:47.965 --> 16:48.965
She wasn't allowed
to compete again, right?

16:48.999 --> 16:50.266
SWEETS:
Uh-huh. Yeah.

16:50.301 --> 16:51.534
She also served
some jail time.

16:51.569 --> 16:53.102
For what?
Insurance fraud.

16:53.137 --> 16:55.538
She intentionally sunk her boat
for the insurance money.

16:55.573 --> 16:56.673
She pulled out her transducer.

16:56.707 --> 16:57.674
Well, that'll do it.

16:57.708 --> 16:58.808
Yeah.

16:58.843 --> 17:00.210
And when Lana's boat went down,

17:00.244 --> 17:01.644
it sunk in the exact same way.

17:01.679 --> 17:03.313
The transducer.

17:05.983 --> 17:08.117
Lana Brewster's the reason
my life went to hell.

17:08.152 --> 17:11.287
I can't believe I have to talk
about the little bitch again.

17:11.321 --> 17:14.390
18 years, the anger's
still very fresh, huh?

17:14.425 --> 17:15.892
I borrowed
one small roll of tape

17:15.925 --> 17:17.861
from a passing boat
to fix my sail.

17:17.895 --> 17:19.561
Lana could've let that go.

17:19.597 --> 17:21.664
But, no, she had me
disqualified for it.

17:21.699 --> 17:23.266
You'd be pretty pissed, too.

17:23.300 --> 17:25.335
So in your perception
of events,

17:25.368 --> 17:26.502
Lana cost you everything.

17:26.537 --> 17:27.569
She did cost me everything.

17:27.605 --> 17:29.372
I lost my endorsements.

17:29.406 --> 17:30.773
I wasn't allowed to compete.

17:30.808 --> 17:32.242
My family practically
disowned me.

17:32.276 --> 17:34.110
Now, you sunk your boat

17:34.144 --> 17:36.179
in the exact same way
that Lana's killer sunk hers.

17:36.213 --> 17:37.614
Look, anyone familiar

17:37.648 --> 17:38.982
with sailboats knows
the easiest way to sink one

17:39.016 --> 17:41.184
is by pulling the transducer.
Okay.

17:41.218 --> 17:43.052
Well, where were you
the day that Lana was murdered?

17:43.087 --> 17:44.153
Okay, look.

17:44.188 --> 17:45.388
I've served time...

17:45.422 --> 17:46.990
so I know you're fishing,

17:47.024 --> 17:48.191
and I don't have
to stay here.

17:48.225 --> 17:49.959
If you have
any other questions,

17:49.961 --> 17:51.661
find someone who cares.

17:59.103 --> 18:00.970
(sighs),

18:01.005 --> 18:04.641
There is no way I would ever
go out in a boat like this.

18:04.675 --> 18:06.276
I'm gonna start
calling you Popeye.

18:06.310 --> 18:07.610
Hey, I won a few
races in my day.

18:07.645 --> 18:09.946
Oh, yacht club?
It was mandatory.

18:09.980 --> 18:12.849
Hey, the boat's
outboard motor is missing.

18:12.883 --> 18:13.950
Maybe she didn't it.

18:13.984 --> 18:16.586
Can you enlarge
the image?

18:17.888 --> 18:19.422
All right, see these marks?

18:19.456 --> 18:20.990
This is where the motor

18:21.025 --> 18:23.660
would normally be clamped on.

18:23.694 --> 18:25.428
Maybe she left it
at home that day or something.

18:25.462 --> 18:26.829
No, it's unlikely.

18:26.864 --> 18:28.531
Why? What are you thinking?

18:28.565 --> 18:30.126
Hey, was her dinghy found
with the boat?

18:30.134 --> 18:31.935
Oh, according
to the Coast Guard files,

18:31.969 --> 18:34.203
no dinghy or outboard motor
were ever recovered.

18:34.238 --> 18:36.839
Yeah, of course not.
What?

18:36.874 --> 18:38.541
Whoever killed Lana probably
put the motor on the dinghy

18:38.575 --> 18:40.310
to get back to shore
after sinking the boat.

18:40.344 --> 18:42.712
That's why neither
was ever found.

18:44.715 --> 18:46.049
SAROYAN:
<i>I'd like to help, Seeley.</i>

18:46.083 --> 18:47.717
But Dr. Brennan
has no evidence

18:47.751 --> 18:49.886
to link these cases
to a serial killer.

18:49.920 --> 18:51.721
Has she ever asked
for something like this before?

18:51.755 --> 18:53.489
That's not the point.

18:53.524 --> 18:55.291
That's exactly
the point, okay?

18:55.326 --> 18:56.759
She's having nightmares, okay?

18:56.794 --> 18:58.528
She can't stop thinking
about those cold cases.

18:58.562 --> 19:00.096
I'm gonna get in trouble

19:00.130 --> 19:02.065
for spending funds to allow her
to pursue a dead end.

19:02.099 --> 19:03.833
And if I don't report
what she's doing,

19:03.867 --> 19:06.069
I'm hiding expenses
and I could get fired.

19:06.103 --> 19:08.371
So let her find out,
that it's a, it's a dead end.

19:08.405 --> 19:10.273
You know she's gonna admit it
if she's wrong.

19:10.307 --> 19:11.407
I do?

19:11.442 --> 19:13.042
Just let this play this out.

19:13.077 --> 19:14.610
I'm sure you can get creative
with the paperwork.

19:14.645 --> 19:16.946
Do you believe her, Seeley?

19:16.981 --> 19:19.248
I want to.

19:19.283 --> 19:21.985
Don't you?

19:22.019 --> 19:24.554
I'll see what I can do.

19:29.526 --> 19:31.227
SWEETS:
<i>Aw, man.</i>

19:31.261 --> 19:34.130
Yacht clubs, sailing, prep schools.
Mm-hmm.

19:34.164 --> 19:37.033
You're dealing very well
with the loss of your fortune.

19:37.067 --> 19:40.670
Truthfully, I thought
it would be harder.

19:40.704 --> 19:42.138
But I don't know,
when I'm at work,

19:42.172 --> 19:43.692
I'm not thinking
about money, you know?

19:43.707 --> 19:45.241
When I'm with Angela
and Michael Vincent,

19:45.275 --> 19:47.043
it never crosses my mind.

19:47.077 --> 19:48.144
I mean, even with you.

19:48.178 --> 19:50.213
The coffee's good, the company.

19:50.247 --> 19:51.581
I'm impressed.

19:51.615 --> 19:53.316
As long as a person
has enough,

19:53.350 --> 19:54.450
they don't need more.

19:54.485 --> 19:56.019
And I've got
more than enough.

19:56.053 --> 19:57.487
'Cause I saw pictures
of that, uh,

19:57.521 --> 19:59.355
estate you had in Wales.
Whoof!

19:59.390 --> 20:00.723
Oh, yeah.

20:00.758 --> 20:02.392
Okay, now that place was sweet.

20:02.426 --> 20:04.827
Oh, man, I do miss that.
Thank you very much.

20:04.862 --> 20:06.896
(chuckles)
Hey.

20:06.930 --> 20:09.799
So, I found out who paid
off the medical examiner.

20:09.833 --> 20:12.769
The $1.9 million that
Leslie Dollinger received

20:12.803 --> 20:16.105
was from the Kestech
Transpo Corporation.

20:16.140 --> 20:17.507
Who owns Kestech?
Well, I had to dig deep

20:17.541 --> 20:18.641
because Kestech is owned

20:18.675 --> 20:20.043
by a holding company
which is owned

20:20.077 --> 20:21.177
by a bunch of other
holding companies,

20:21.211 --> 20:22.311
but I tracked it down.

20:22.346 --> 20:23.312
Kestech is part

20:23.347 --> 20:25.314
of the McNamara Corporation.

20:25.349 --> 20:27.583
Oh, my God, the McNamaras.

20:27.618 --> 20:29.352
Yeah, McNam...
They're as rich as you were.

20:29.386 --> 20:31.320
Nah, they were richer.
I mean that-that's

20:31.355 --> 20:33.356
railroad and oil money.

20:33.390 --> 20:35.958
My dad used to play golf

20:35.993 --> 20:37.493
with the patriarch, Giles.

20:37.528 --> 20:39.395
I mean, our families,
we hung out together.

20:39.430 --> 20:41.431
Okay.

20:41.465 --> 20:43.800
The financial trail leads
right to your old friends.

20:43.834 --> 20:46.502
The McNamaras paid
off Leslie Dollinger

20:46.537 --> 20:48.171
to cover up Lana's murder.

20:48.205 --> 20:50.039
Okay, so how is
Lana Brewster then

20:50.074 --> 20:52.175
connected to the McNamaras?

20:52.209 --> 20:53.709
Trent.

20:53.744 --> 20:55.278
Excuse me?

20:55.312 --> 20:56.412
Trent McNamara.

20:56.447 --> 20:57.847
Hey, didn't Lana's brother

20:57.881 --> 20:59.982
say she had a boyfriend?
Mm-hmm.

21:00.017 --> 21:01.818
And you think it was him?

21:01.852 --> 21:04.287
His father was always bailing
him out of one mess or another.

21:04.321 --> 21:06.856
He also went through girls
like they were toys.

21:06.890 --> 21:10.426
Trent McNamara was
a nasty piece of work.

21:15.394 --> 21:17.161
Trent McNamara was
a pretty troubled kid.

21:17.196 --> 21:20.064
He got kicked out of four
prep schools for cheating,

21:20.099 --> 21:21.366
drugs and assault.

21:21.400 --> 21:22.800
Wait a second.
What kind of assault?

21:22.835 --> 21:24.469
Fighting mostly.
The last school tried

21:24.503 --> 21:26.838
to channel that aggression
into fencing.

21:26.872 --> 21:28.539
And he was good, but he got
kicked out of that, too,

21:28.574 --> 21:30.241
when he took
the tip of his foil.

21:30.275 --> 21:31.943
What are you saying?
He actually stabbed someone?

21:31.977 --> 21:34.612
In psychological terms,
the kid was a mess.

21:34.646 --> 21:37.782
And get this, two days
after Lana's body was found,

21:37.816 --> 21:39.117
his father shipped him off

21:39.151 --> 21:40.952
to some private school
in Switzerland.

21:40.986 --> 21:43.654
Oh-ho, okay. Fleeing the country
and falsified coroner's report.

21:43.689 --> 21:45.423
It doesn't look good for Trent.

21:45.457 --> 21:47.692
Maybe that's what the note
with Lana's remains meant.

21:47.726 --> 21:49.727
"Please find out what
really happened to me."

21:49.762 --> 21:51.796
You think Trent is
what happened to her?

21:51.830 --> 21:53.264
You can ask him.

21:53.298 --> 21:54.332
What? Is he in town?

21:54.366 --> 21:55.933
His father died three days ago.

21:55.968 --> 21:57.135
Trent's in town for the funeral.

21:57.169 --> 21:58.936
But can I make
a suggestion, Booth?

21:58.971 --> 22:01.072
Send Hodgins instead of me.

22:01.106 --> 22:02.073
Hodgins? Why?

22:02.107 --> 22:03.374
Hodgins is a blue blood,

22:03.409 --> 22:04.642
like Trent.
They even knew each other.

22:04.677 --> 22:05.677
Whoa, wait a second--

22:05.711 --> 22:06.978
Hodgins speaks

22:07.012 --> 22:08.246
rich people language?

22:08.280 --> 22:09.280
Exactly.

22:09.314 --> 22:10.648
Okay, I got a even better idea.

22:10.683 --> 22:12.583
Why don't you and
Hodgins go talk to him?

22:12.618 --> 22:14.619
But... Booth?

22:18.057 --> 22:19.957
Dr. Edison...
Oh! What?

22:19.992 --> 22:21.125
I was just getting
something to eat.

22:21.160 --> 22:22.226
Good.

22:22.261 --> 22:23.494
I mean, I could have
eaten at home,

22:23.529 --> 22:24.862
no reason except
that, you know,

22:24.897 --> 22:26.531
I just wanted to get
a jump on the day.

22:26.565 --> 22:28.499
What do you think of
Dr. Brennan's serial killer?

22:28.534 --> 22:29.801
I'm sorry. Excuse me?

22:29.835 --> 22:31.502
Do you think those
cases are linked?

22:31.537 --> 22:32.770
Is there a serial killer?

22:32.805 --> 22:33.971
I'm asking for your opinion.

22:34.006 --> 22:35.740
(sighs)

22:35.774 --> 22:37.375
I'm skeptical.

22:37.409 --> 22:38.609
Excellent.

22:38.644 --> 22:40.178
These are the files
on all six

22:40.212 --> 22:41.679
Ghost Killer victims.

22:41.714 --> 22:44.549
I want you to oversee this one.

22:44.583 --> 22:46.317
Does Dr. Brennan know

22:46.351 --> 22:48.052
you're making me
responsible for these?

22:48.087 --> 22:49.554
She doesn't
need to know.

22:49.588 --> 22:51.189
But I'd like to keep
this between us

22:51.223 --> 22:52.290
for as long
as possible.

22:52.324 --> 22:53.825
Oh, yeah.

22:55.194 --> 22:56.561
Huh.

23:02.000 --> 23:04.135
(horse whinnies)

23:05.237 --> 23:06.604
This is nice.

23:06.638 --> 23:07.839
(scoffs) You said
that with an edge.

23:07.873 --> 23:09.207
No, I didn't.

23:09.241 --> 23:10.908
This is why you
brought me, Sweets, okay?

23:10.943 --> 23:13.478
I heard the envy
in your voice.

23:15.547 --> 23:18.082
SWEETS:
There he is.

23:20.486 --> 23:23.454
HODGINS: Yeah, and that's
his sister Stephanie.

23:23.489 --> 23:26.324
Wow, time has been
a bit tough on Trent.

23:26.358 --> 23:28.192
I remember him as
an athletic golden boy.

23:28.227 --> 23:29.427
Now he looks like hell.

23:29.461 --> 23:30.895
SWEETS: Okay, I heard
a definite tinge

23:30.929 --> 23:32.530
of satisfaction
in your voice.

23:32.564 --> 23:34.265
Yeah, you did.
Trent was a dick.

23:34.299 --> 23:35.800
Hi.

23:35.834 --> 23:37.168
STEPHANIE:
<i>It's good to see you, Jack.</i>

23:37.202 --> 23:38.603
I'm sorry to hear about you

23:38.637 --> 23:39.871
losing your family's money.

23:39.905 --> 23:41.939
Must be difficult.

23:41.974 --> 23:44.008
TRENT: Jack never really seemed
to care much for money.

23:44.042 --> 23:45.910
As long as he had his bugs.

23:45.944 --> 23:47.779
I'm doing fine, Steph.

23:47.813 --> 23:49.547
I married an amazing woman,

23:49.581 --> 23:51.349
I have a beautiful
boy, so...

23:51.383 --> 23:52.917
No complaints,
actually.

23:52.951 --> 23:54.085
We want to talk to you
about Lana Brewster.

23:54.119 --> 23:55.520
The sailor girl?

23:55.554 --> 23:57.088
Yeah, her brother
told us that she had

23:57.122 --> 23:58.823
a boyfriend around
the time that she died.

23:58.857 --> 24:00.091
Didn't say who it was, though.

24:00.125 --> 24:01.859
Thought it might be you, Trent.

24:01.894 --> 24:02.894
STEPHANIE:
Boy, you really must be

24:02.928 --> 24:03.995
a part of the FBI.

24:04.029 --> 24:05.229
Should we call
our lawyer?

24:05.264 --> 24:06.397
It was me.

24:06.431 --> 24:08.166
What?

24:08.200 --> 24:09.233
You liked a lot of girls, Trent.

24:09.268 --> 24:10.701
Why'd you keep
this one a secret?

24:10.736 --> 24:13.171
Because I was in court-ordered
Alcoholics Anonymous.

24:13.205 --> 24:14.605
SWEETS: You're not supposed to start
a romantic relationship

24:14.640 --> 24:16.607
when you start AA.

24:16.642 --> 24:19.210
So why did you skip town
right after Lana's death?

24:19.244 --> 24:20.211
He didn't skip town.

24:20.245 --> 24:21.846
It was a coincidence.

24:21.880 --> 24:23.848
TRENT: We ran out of
American private schools.

24:23.882 --> 24:25.883
Dad was hoping the Swiss
could handle me.

24:25.918 --> 24:27.351
SWEETS: We have evidence
your father

24:27.386 --> 24:29.387
paid off the medical examiner
to cover up

24:29.421 --> 24:30.661
the fact that
Lana was murdered.

24:30.689 --> 24:32.356
You think I killed Lana?

24:32.391 --> 24:33.558
Looks like that's
what your father thought.

24:33.592 --> 24:34.892
Jack!

24:34.927 --> 24:36.260
We all know how these
things work, okay?

24:36.295 --> 24:38.963
He was trying to protect Trent.

24:38.997 --> 24:40.731
It's been really lovely
seeing you again, Jack,

24:40.766 --> 24:43.668
but this is definitely the part
where we call our lawyer.

24:51.743 --> 24:53.678
Do you concur this is
probably cause of death?

24:53.712 --> 24:54.912
Yes.

24:54.947 --> 24:56.280
Why didn't we
see this earlier?

24:56.315 --> 24:57.582
It was obfuscated by
the blunt force trauma

24:57.616 --> 25:00.284
that fractured
the sternum.

25:00.319 --> 25:02.687
Do you think this could have
been cause by a foil?

25:02.721 --> 25:05.590
Oh! From fencing.

25:05.624 --> 25:06.824
Yes.

25:06.859 --> 25:08.259
Yes, that is possible.

25:09.862 --> 25:11.128
Dr. Brennan?

25:11.163 --> 25:12.396
I've seen this wound before.

25:12.431 --> 25:14.932
On one of
the Ghost Killer victims.

25:14.967 --> 25:16.300
That seems unlikely.

25:16.335 --> 25:17.969
Everyone keeps telling me

25:18.003 --> 25:19.670
that I'm making connections
that aren't there.

25:19.705 --> 25:21.939
But I don't do
that kind of thing.

25:21.974 --> 25:23.774
I'm not that
kind of a person.

25:34.086 --> 25:36.020
Dr. Brennan, we're
supposed to be working

25:36.054 --> 25:37.455
on the Lana
Brewster case.

25:38.557 --> 25:40.691
These remains are the ones

25:40.726 --> 25:42.660
that Pelant led me to
months ago.

25:42.694 --> 25:44.574
The ones where he said
all of them were murdered

25:44.596 --> 25:45.863
by the same serial killer?

25:45.898 --> 25:47.298
A woman, yes.

25:47.332 --> 25:48.666
So this has nothing to do

25:48.700 --> 25:50.100
with Lana Brewster's case.
I believe

25:50.102 --> 25:53.404
Lana Brewster was
the first victim.

25:53.438 --> 25:56.474
Chloe Campbell
and Lana Brewster

25:56.508 --> 25:58.643
were both killed
as a result of

25:58.677 --> 26:01.345
a nail-like stake being
punched through their sternum.

26:01.380 --> 26:04.015
It's a very
unique injury.

26:04.049 --> 26:06.284
The indentations
are different.

26:06.318 --> 26:09.020
I can't corroborate
your supposition.

26:09.054 --> 26:11.355
I don't need your
approval, Dr. Edison.

26:11.390 --> 26:13.658
Yeah, but you do need
someone to back you up,

26:13.692 --> 26:15.059
especially if you're
accusing Trent McNamara

26:15.093 --> 26:16.494
of being a serial killer.

26:16.528 --> 26:17.862
I already said
the serial killer is a woman.

26:17.896 --> 26:19.063
Dr. Brennan.

26:19.097 --> 26:21.299
Do you recall
Trent was a fencer

26:21.333 --> 26:25.269
and this wound is congruent
with a sharpened foil?

26:25.304 --> 26:27.738
Trent McNamara didn't
murder Lana Brewster.

26:27.773 --> 26:28.839
Because Trent McNamara
is not a woman?

26:28.874 --> 26:30.041
Exactly.

26:33.011 --> 26:35.513
Dr. Saroyan wanted me
to ask you to return to the lab.

26:37.849 --> 26:41.385
Our first priority is solving
Lana Brewster's murder.

26:43.455 --> 26:44.689
So you don't believe me, either.

26:44.723 --> 26:45.957
It's not
about belief.

26:45.991 --> 26:47.892
It's about the evidence.

26:47.926 --> 26:50.061
You taught me that.

26:52.264 --> 26:54.332
If Dr. Saroyan wants us
to get back to the lab,

26:54.366 --> 26:56.801
we should...

27:13.151 --> 27:14.452
I know who you are.

27:14.486 --> 27:16.220
You're not supposed
to be here.

27:16.254 --> 27:17.888
Yeah, I'm not here in
an official capacity...

27:17.923 --> 27:19.190
I don't care
why you're here.

27:19.224 --> 27:20.825
This family's been
harassed enough.

27:20.859 --> 27:22.393
Now if you don't
leave this property...

27:22.427 --> 27:24.528
It's okay. It's okay, Donna.

27:24.563 --> 27:25.763
Jack, why are you here?

27:25.797 --> 27:27.531
I told him to leave,
Mr. McNamara.

27:27.566 --> 27:29.233
I can call the guys...
It's okay.

27:29.267 --> 27:30.401
I got this.

27:30.435 --> 27:31.969
You can work
around back right now.

27:35.574 --> 27:37.074
You know I'm not supposed
to talk to you, Jack.

27:37.109 --> 27:38.676
Yeah? Then you
let me talk.

27:38.710 --> 27:40.845
I never
liked you, Trent.

27:42.581 --> 27:44.048
You were that guy,

27:44.082 --> 27:45.282
the one who
took pleasure

27:45.317 --> 27:47.618
in tormenting
the weaker kids.

27:47.652 --> 27:48.919
Is this going
someplace?

27:48.954 --> 27:50.114
You know,
I remember the night

27:50.122 --> 27:52.556
that you slept over
at my place.

27:52.591 --> 27:54.658
And my mom and dad,

27:54.693 --> 27:56.360
they came in
to say good night,

27:56.395 --> 27:59.663
and they gave me
a hug and a kiss.

27:59.698 --> 28:02.833
You know, I didn't
think anything of it.

28:02.868 --> 28:06.604
But you asked if something
special was happening.

28:08.407 --> 28:09.807
You said you
couldn't remember

28:09.841 --> 28:12.943
if your parents
ever did that.

28:12.978 --> 28:14.178
And of course,
you made fun of me,

28:14.212 --> 28:15.513
because you were
supposed to be strong.

28:15.547 --> 28:18.616
But I saw how much
you wished it was you.

28:19.718 --> 28:21.619
And that's probably why

28:21.653 --> 28:23.788
we never hung out
after that,

28:23.822 --> 28:25.756
'cause you were embarrassed
that I saw that.

28:25.791 --> 28:27.058
And you think
I'm the same.

28:27.092 --> 28:28.459
You think that
I killed Lana.

28:28.493 --> 28:29.727
I get it.
You didn't have to drive

28:29.761 --> 28:31.062
all the way out here
to tell me that.

28:31.096 --> 28:33.464
But I don't, Trent.

28:33.498 --> 28:36.000
I think you
did love Lana.

28:37.102 --> 28:39.670
And...

28:39.704 --> 28:41.372
I don't think you
would kill someone

28:41.406 --> 28:44.241
who gave you what
you wanted for so long.

28:48.046 --> 28:50.581
You're the only one, Jack.

28:59.543 --> 29:02.427
The remains from the
six Ghost Killer murders are missing.

29:02.615 --> 29:04.416
No, they aren't.

29:04.450 --> 29:05.617
I assigned them
to Dr. Edison.

29:05.652 --> 29:06.918
And there is
no Ghost Killer.

29:06.953 --> 29:08.020
Not yet, at least.

29:08.054 --> 29:09.688
I'll have them
sent back to me.

29:09.722 --> 29:11.289
No, you won't.

29:11.324 --> 29:12.858
I'm your boss,
Dr. Brennan.

29:12.892 --> 29:14.393
Don't forget that.

29:14.427 --> 29:17.663
Everyone's colluding,
working against me.

29:17.697 --> 29:19.031
I don't understand.

29:19.065 --> 29:20.966
Why would you give those
remains to Dr. Edison?

29:21.000 --> 29:23.001
Because Dr. Edison
is an objective eye.

29:23.036 --> 29:25.337
Perhaps, but I'm better.

29:25.371 --> 29:27.339
Not when you
don't see clearly.

29:27.373 --> 29:29.307
You want those six murders
solved, don't you?

29:29.342 --> 29:31.643
That means that
I have to assign

29:31.678 --> 29:33.211
resources in pursuit
of that end.

29:33.246 --> 29:35.480
But to do that,
I have to convince the board,

29:35.515 --> 29:36.715
beyond the
shadow of a doubt,

29:36.749 --> 29:38.350
that there is, in fact,
a serial killer.

29:38.384 --> 29:40.485
And my word isn't enough?
Would it be for you?

29:40.520 --> 29:41.987
With no evidence?

29:42.021 --> 29:43.989
Look, I am trying
to help you,

29:44.023 --> 29:45.390
Dr. Brennan.
And I think you know

29:45.425 --> 29:46.992
there is no one
in the world

29:47.026 --> 29:48.827
that would work harder to
impress you than Dr. Edison.

29:48.861 --> 29:50.829
That is not true.

29:50.863 --> 29:53.398
Of all the people working
at the Jeffersonian,

29:53.433 --> 29:55.333
he is the least awed
by my abilities.

29:55.368 --> 29:57.002
That is absolutely true,

29:57.036 --> 29:58.437
if you mean the
complete opposite.

29:58.471 --> 30:01.606
I've already done
so much work already.

30:01.641 --> 30:04.643
I have binders
filled with findings.

30:04.677 --> 30:06.411
Then I suggest you give
those to Dr. Edison,

30:06.446 --> 30:08.814
because he is the one who
will determine whether or not

30:08.848 --> 30:10.515
we're looking for
a serial killer.

30:10.550 --> 30:12.651
That is my decision.

30:13.586 --> 30:14.920
(sighs)

30:14.954 --> 30:17.422
(sighs)

30:22.595 --> 30:23.795
MONTENEGRO:
Hey.

30:23.830 --> 30:25.163
You can't tell Cam.

30:25.198 --> 30:26.398
Tell Cam what?

30:26.432 --> 30:28.700
Well...
these weapons

30:28.735 --> 30:30.535
are for the Lana
Brewster murder.

30:30.570 --> 30:34.439
But these are for
the Ghost Killer.

30:34.474 --> 30:36.508
The Ghost Killer?

30:36.542 --> 30:37.843
We owe it to
Brennan, don't we?

30:37.877 --> 30:39.244
Even if it
comes to nothing?

30:39.278 --> 30:40.512
You really are
a wonderful guy.

30:40.546 --> 30:42.781
Even if you did
sleep with a Binky.

30:42.815 --> 30:44.916
You don't make that sound
as good as it was.

30:44.951 --> 30:46.651
(scoffs)

30:46.686 --> 30:49.354
Sorry, uh... what
did you need, Angie?

30:49.388 --> 30:50.956
Yeah, uh...

30:50.990 --> 30:52.858
It's Trent.

30:54.093 --> 30:55.727
Uh, Booth
just called.

30:55.762 --> 30:58.864
Trent shot himself.

30:58.898 --> 31:00.699
What?

31:04.904 --> 31:07.439
I-I just saw him.

31:08.341 --> 31:09.941
What did
the note say?

31:09.976 --> 31:11.543
Um, I-I don't think
there was a note.

31:11.577 --> 31:12.677
After everything
that happened,

31:12.712 --> 31:13.812
Trent would've
left a note.

31:13.846 --> 31:14.946
Okay, Cam can check.

31:14.981 --> 31:16.248
She's going
out there now.

31:16.282 --> 31:17.616
I'm going, too.
Honey, I don't...

31:17.650 --> 31:19.551
I have to, Angie, okay?
I can help.

31:24.157 --> 31:26.024
The window was closed,

31:26.058 --> 31:27.492
and I wasn't too sure...

31:37.036 --> 31:38.937
Thought Dr. Brennan
would come.

31:38.971 --> 31:40.605
This is all flesh.

31:40.640 --> 31:42.808
Not her domain.

31:42.842 --> 31:43.975
(Hodgins sighs)

31:44.010 --> 31:45.410
I don't
believe this.

31:45.444 --> 31:47.612
Are you sure
you're okay, Dr. Hodgins?

31:47.647 --> 31:50.048
Yes.
I have a job to do.

31:50.082 --> 31:52.551
We can get somebody else
to gather the particulates...

31:52.585 --> 31:53.919
They might miss
something.

31:53.953 --> 31:56.488
I can do this, Cam.

31:56.522 --> 31:57.956
Okay.

31:59.192 --> 32:01.827
A single gunshot wound
to the temple.

32:01.861 --> 32:05.430
No other evidence of
foul play on the remains.

32:05.464 --> 32:08.099
This sure looks to me
like an admission of guilt.

32:09.669 --> 32:10.936
Excuse me, Officer, uh...

32:10.970 --> 32:12.604
have you find a note yet?

32:19.111 --> 32:21.913
Steph, you really
shouldn't be here right now.

32:21.948 --> 32:25.951
(sighing): I don't know
why I'm surprised.

32:25.985 --> 32:27.752
You were expecting this?
No. Not this.

32:27.787 --> 32:30.088
It's just... something.

32:30.122 --> 32:31.890
It's always something
in this family.

32:31.924 --> 32:33.491
Trent killed a girl,

32:33.526 --> 32:35.894
probably just 'cause
he was sick of her,

32:35.928 --> 32:37.229
and Daddy didn't care,
he just sent him away.

32:37.263 --> 32:38.730
HODGINS:
Look, Steph,

32:38.764 --> 32:40.232
I'm gonna take you into
the other room, okay?

32:40.266 --> 32:42.000
I'm gonna get you
settled, all right?

32:43.269 --> 32:45.804
Trent was
the last male.

32:47.673 --> 32:50.208
I think that's a good thing.

32:51.677 --> 32:53.245
SAROYAN:
We'll release

32:53.279 --> 32:55.914
his body as soon as we can.

32:55.948 --> 32:58.383
I suppose a funeral
will be expected.

33:00.386 --> 33:01.987
It'll be big...

33:02.021 --> 33:03.788
even though no one cares.

33:03.823 --> 33:06.858
Hey, Steph, let me take you
into the other room, okay?

33:06.893 --> 33:08.426
We'll get you settled.

33:28.514 --> 33:30.815
Hey, Cam wants to know

33:30.850 --> 33:32.817
if you have the results
from Trent's swabs.

33:32.852 --> 33:35.020
She wants to finish
the autopsy as soon as possible.

33:35.054 --> 33:37.522
I'm just waiting on
the Mass Spec.

33:37.556 --> 33:39.291
When I went to go see him
this afternoon,

33:39.325 --> 33:41.326
he was wearing this shirt.

33:41.360 --> 33:43.895
I'm so sorry, honey.

33:45.431 --> 33:47.666
We could've turned out
the same way, you know.

33:47.700 --> 33:49.501
We had the same
kind of life.

33:49.535 --> 33:52.037
Yeah, but you turned out
a lot different.

33:52.071 --> 33:54.039
Thank God.

33:54.073 --> 33:56.541
He was such a dick and all,
you know?

33:56.575 --> 33:58.177
But he just didn't seem

33:58.202 --> 34:00.111
like the kind of guy
who would kill someone.

34:00.112 --> 34:01.579
That was more his dad's thing.

34:01.614 --> 34:04.215
That's why I went
to go see him, you know?

34:04.250 --> 34:07.319
Just to tell him that.
But I don't know, I don't know.

34:07.353 --> 34:09.154
Maybe that just made it worse.

34:09.188 --> 34:11.089
Maybe that's why
he shot himself.

34:11.123 --> 34:12.724
No, honey,
you didn't have anything

34:12.757 --> 34:14.893
to do with this.
You know that.

34:14.927 --> 34:17.728
If he was the killer,
he would've left a note, Angie.

34:17.763 --> 34:19.831
He would've told us why.

34:19.864 --> 34:22.900
Things don't always end
as neatly as we'd like them to.

34:22.935 --> 34:26.371
I just keep hoping that
we missed something somewhere

34:26.405 --> 34:29.541
that, you know,
he wasn't a murderer.

34:29.574 --> 34:32.444
Yeah, but so far,
the evidence says we haven't.

34:32.478 --> 34:34.112
(computer beeping)

34:34.146 --> 34:35.580
Are those the results
for Cam?

34:38.684 --> 34:40.819
"Antimony, barium, and lead."

34:40.853 --> 34:42.687
What does that mean?

34:42.722 --> 34:46.424
It means Trent's hands tested
positive for gunshot residue.

34:47.927 --> 34:51.696
Cam will use this to confirm
that he... he shot himself.

34:52.898 --> 34:55.632
BRENNAN:
<i>Since you have been doubting</i>

34:55.668 --> 34:57.936
my judgment
as a forensic anthropologist,

34:57.970 --> 35:00.238
I'll allow Dr. Edison
to explain this to you.

35:00.272 --> 35:01.672
I absolutely trust you,
Dr. Brennan.

35:01.674 --> 35:03.675
By having Dr. Edison
do my work?

35:03.709 --> 35:05.977
EDISON: I don't think I should be here
for this conversation.

35:06.012 --> 35:08.446
I agree, but Dr. Saroyan wants
you here, so proceed,

35:08.481 --> 35:10.815
Dr. Edison--
tell her what I found.

35:10.850 --> 35:13.385
If you agree
with my conclusions.

35:14.653 --> 35:16.855
Dr. Edison?

35:19.458 --> 35:22.327
The victim has
a remodeled injury

35:22.361 --> 35:23.928
to the carpals
on his right hand.

35:23.963 --> 35:26.631
It's indicative of
a deep laceration that cut

35:26.665 --> 35:28.166
all the way
down to the bone.

35:28.200 --> 35:30.769
I thought I was explaining.
You are. Very slowly.

35:30.803 --> 35:33.972
A cut this deep would have
severed the median

35:34.006 --> 35:36.574
and ulnar nerves at the wrist.
In which case, Trent

35:36.609 --> 35:37.609
would've been able to point,

35:37.643 --> 35:39.110
maybe even throw up
a peace sign.

35:39.145 --> 35:40.845
But he wouldn't have had
any fine motor skills.

35:40.880 --> 35:43.815
Trent McNamara was incapable
of bending his trigger finger,

35:43.849 --> 35:45.984
which means he could
not have shot himself.

35:52.850 --> 35:56.265
With any other gun, I'd agree
with you, Dr. Brennan, but

35:56.266 --> 35:59.543
the weapon he used
was a stainless .357

35:59.544 --> 36:01.688
that only has a
three-and-a-half-pound trigger pull.

36:01.689 --> 36:02.522
It's very light.

36:02.556 --> 36:04.123
It would have
been painful,

36:04.158 --> 36:05.233
but he still would have been
capable of pulling the trigger.

36:05.234 --> 36:07.256
Then why didn't he simply use
his left hand?

36:07.257 --> 36:09.425
He was trying
to kill himself, Dr. Brennan.

36:09.459 --> 36:12.328
Suicides use their dominant hand
98.8% of the time.

36:12.626 --> 36:14.624
Exactly. There's still
a possibility

36:14.625 --> 36:17.529
that this is not a suicide
and an even greater possibility

36:17.530 --> 36:19.130
that he did not murder
Lana Brewster.

36:19.165 --> 36:20.465
Isn't that correct, Dr. Edison?

36:20.499 --> 36:23.868
Leaning hard on the word
"possibility," but yes.

36:23.903 --> 36:26.171
Hey. I just finished going over

36:26.205 --> 36:28.173
the visitor logs
that the techs sent over

36:28.207 --> 36:29.941
from the McNamara estate.
And?

36:29.975 --> 36:34.612
Dan Brewster visited Trent less
than an hour before he died.

36:35.948 --> 36:37.816
(sighs)

36:37.850 --> 36:39.551
Yeah, I went to see
Trent McNamara.

36:39.585 --> 36:41.219
What's the big deal?

36:41.253 --> 36:43.188
He's dead.

36:43.222 --> 36:44.656
What?

36:44.690 --> 36:46.090
How?

36:46.125 --> 36:47.358
It was either a suicide

36:47.393 --> 36:48.860
or a death made
to look like suicide.

36:48.894 --> 36:49.861
Why'd you go see him?

36:49.895 --> 36:51.062
He called me.

36:51.096 --> 36:52.297
This explains a lot.

36:52.331 --> 36:53.598
Why?

36:53.632 --> 36:57.468
He told me that Lana worried
about me.

36:58.637 --> 37:00.572
He said that she felt terrible

37:00.606 --> 37:02.307
about Erika Stamp, too.

37:02.341 --> 37:04.142
They used to be close.

37:04.176 --> 37:08.079
Why did you say,
"This explains a lot"?

37:08.113 --> 37:09.714
It's obvious now, isn't it?

37:09.748 --> 37:11.316
He was making amends.

37:11.350 --> 37:13.251
You're saying that Trent
was tidying up loose ends

37:13.285 --> 37:14.219
before killing himself.

37:14.253 --> 37:15.520
Yeah.

37:16.789 --> 37:18.323
I know what you're thinking.

37:18.357 --> 37:20.825
Wh... Why would I kill him?

37:20.860 --> 37:22.427
For revenge?

37:22.461 --> 37:24.295
You were the last person
to see Trent alive.

37:24.330 --> 37:28.566
Yes, and that's exactly how
I left him... alive.

37:42.371 --> 37:44.005
Oh! Dr. Brennan...

37:45.417 --> 37:46.593
Good evening.

37:46.594 --> 37:48.458
Do you have the time
to do this properly?

37:48.483 --> 37:49.233
Excuse me?

37:49.234 --> 37:51.902
I'm concerned that
if it comes to a choice

37:51.937 --> 37:54.405
between the Ghost Killer,
your archaeological endeavors,

37:54.439 --> 37:56.574
and your personal life,
the Ghost Killer will lose.

37:56.608 --> 37:58.609
By which I mean win.

38:00.078 --> 38:01.512
(scoffs)

38:04.716 --> 38:08.385
Nora and I are breaking up
after eight years together.

38:08.420 --> 38:10.955
There comes a time when,

38:10.989 --> 38:13.991
if a couple doesn't make
that next step...

38:14.025 --> 38:17.861
You see, Nora wanted
to get married, and I ...

38:17.896 --> 38:21.131
I think Nora has found someone
else to move forward with.

38:21.166 --> 38:24.068
I mean, I can't prove it,
but as you know,

38:24.102 --> 38:28.272
you don't always need proof
to know when something is true.

38:28.306 --> 38:31.008
Even if it isn't,

38:31.042 --> 38:35.546
Nora and I are not together
anymore,

38:35.580 --> 38:38.782
and I have
to tell you I'm, uh...

38:41.253 --> 38:44.255
(voice breaking): I'm very...
I'm very sad about that.

38:45.190 --> 38:48.759
So, yes...

38:48.793 --> 38:51.729
I promise (clears throat)

38:51.763 --> 38:55.933
that I have more
than enough time.

38:55.967 --> 38:57.801
I won't let you down.

38:59.104 --> 39:01.939
Thank you.
That is a great relief to me.

39:05.910 --> 39:08.946
I'm sorry for the emotional pain
you're going through.

39:08.980 --> 39:12.049
And I admire the fact
that it hasn't impeded

39:12.083 --> 39:15.819
your impressive abilities
to work.

39:15.854 --> 39:18.555
Thank you.

39:18.590 --> 39:21.925
You know, I'm sorry
that that all spilled out.

39:21.960 --> 39:23.260
I'm-I'm not... (chuckles)

39:23.295 --> 39:24.928
I'm not really sure
what happened.

39:24.963 --> 39:27.498
That happens to me, too.

39:28.566 --> 39:29.833
I hold things in,
and then

39:29.868 --> 39:30.968
watch out!

39:31.002 --> 39:32.770
(both chuckle)

39:38.176 --> 39:39.343
Good night, Dr. Brennan.

39:39.377 --> 39:41.445
Good night, Clark.

39:41.479 --> 39:44.014
I think you should call me
Temperance.

39:44.049 --> 39:46.016
At least
when we're alone.

39:46.051 --> 39:49.119
Mm, "Temperance."

39:49.154 --> 39:51.622
I'm not sure
I'm comfortable with that.

39:53.992 --> 39:56.360
But I'll try.

40:13.878 --> 40:15.346
Cam, Cam, Cam, Cam!

40:15.380 --> 40:17.047
Okay, stop saying
my name like that.

40:17.082 --> 40:19.149
I found traces
of the same microscopic pollen

40:19.184 --> 40:20.392
on Trent's clothes as were

40:20.417 --> 40:22.319
on the box that contained
Lana's remains.

40:22.320 --> 40:24.588
So you're saying Trent dug up
Lana Brewster's remains

40:24.622 --> 40:26.262
and left them on
Dr. Brennan's front door?

40:26.291 --> 40:27.524
Well, that's
a reasonable conclusion.

40:27.559 --> 40:28.759
Which means
he didn't kill her.

40:28.793 --> 40:30.094
That's not so reasonable.

40:30.128 --> 40:32.229
You think he wants
to get caught for a murder

40:32.263 --> 40:33.664
he committed
18 years ago?

40:33.698 --> 40:35.099
He shot himself.

40:35.133 --> 40:38.335
It seems like an
admission of guilt to me.

40:42.507 --> 40:44.708
I don't buy it.

40:47.579 --> 40:48.812
Cam?

40:48.847 --> 40:51.148
Oh, God.

40:51.182 --> 40:53.384
I read your autopsy
report on Trent McNamara.

40:53.418 --> 40:54.685
Yup.

40:54.719 --> 40:56.854
Cause of death:
gunshot wound to the head.

40:56.888 --> 40:57.888
I noticed that

40:57.922 --> 41:00.324
he had an avulsion fracture

41:00.358 --> 41:03.060
to the third distal
phalanx of his left hand.

41:03.094 --> 41:04.561
Yes, his fingernail
was ripped off.

41:04.596 --> 41:06.096
Probably from
a sailing accident,

41:06.131 --> 41:07.731
reefing in a topsail
or something.

41:07.766 --> 41:11.402
Lana Brewster sustained
the exact same wound.

41:11.436 --> 41:14.371
These are very unique injuries.

41:14.406 --> 41:16.807
I thought you might want
to tell Dr. Edison

41:16.841 --> 41:19.610
for his Ghost Killer File,
or whatever he's calling it.

41:19.644 --> 41:22.379
So you think
there's a possibility

41:22.414 --> 41:24.848
that Trent was killed
by the Ghost Killer?

41:24.883 --> 41:27.651
Shouldn't we look
at every possibility?

41:27.685 --> 41:29.052
All right.

41:29.087 --> 41:31.121
Don't you want
to tell him yourself?

41:31.156 --> 41:33.290
I was going to,

41:33.324 --> 41:34.758
but something else came up,

41:34.793 --> 41:37.995
and then I thought we should
do this your way.

41:38.029 --> 41:39.997
My way?
Yes.

41:40.031 --> 41:41.932
It's your lab,

41:41.966 --> 41:44.735
so we should do things your way.

41:46.070 --> 41:47.471
Good night.

41:55.447 --> 41:57.381
Boom! Voila.

41:57.415 --> 41:59.049
I'm not hungry.
Yes, you are.

41:59.083 --> 42:00.984
You just don't
know it yet-- here.

42:01.019 --> 42:02.619
The inquest is going to rule

42:02.654 --> 42:04.254
that Trent McNamara killed
Lana Brewster

42:04.289 --> 42:05.956
and then committed suicide.

42:05.990 --> 42:09.159
But Lana Brewster
and Trent McNamara

42:09.194 --> 42:12.896
both had their fingernail
ripped off.

42:12.931 --> 42:16.099
It's too coincidental.

42:16.134 --> 42:18.335
What do you think?

42:18.369 --> 42:19.937
Uh, you know what?

42:21.272 --> 42:23.173
I think we're gonna catch her.

42:24.142 --> 42:25.209
Her?

42:25.243 --> 42:27.644
That's what you said, "her."

42:29.180 --> 42:30.314
But you believe me?

42:30.348 --> 42:32.082
Okay, look,

42:32.116 --> 42:34.618
if you don't trust the evidence

42:34.652 --> 42:37.087
that Trent killed
himself,

42:37.121 --> 42:39.857
then I don't trust
the evidence.

42:39.891 --> 42:41.158
That's it?

42:41.192 --> 42:42.559
That's it.
Now take a bite

42:42.594 --> 42:44.034
of that sandwich--
eat up, it's good.

42:49.901 --> 42:51.535
(chuckles)

42:51.569 --> 42:53.070
Mm-hmm.

42:53.104 --> 42:54.972
Oh!

42:55.006 --> 42:56.540
Mmm, good, right?

42:56.574 --> 42:59.009
I was hungry.
Mm-hmm.

42:59.043 --> 43:01.445
You know me better
than I know myself.

43:01.479 --> 43:03.080
I do, right? I do.
Kiss me.

43:03.114 --> 43:05.561
Good sandwich, huh? Right?
I got your back.
