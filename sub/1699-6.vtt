00:24.849 --> 00:26.218
I know that stare.

00:26.219 --> 00:27.870
That's the
Crystal stare.

00:27.871 --> 00:29.710
And that was
the Crystal drool.

00:30.281 --> 00:31.962
I don't know what
you talking about.

00:32.741 --> 00:34.575
You want to talk
to that girl all year.

00:34.576 --> 00:35.725
Why don't you
just ask her

00:35.726 --> 00:38.537
to the charity drive carnival
this Saturday?

00:38.538 --> 00:39.996
I don't know, Rae.

00:39.997 --> 00:41.591
I know you're shy.

00:41.592 --> 00:42.862
It's okay.

00:43.479 --> 00:46.029
But I know a perfect way
to get her to notice you.

00:46.030 --> 00:46.854
How?

00:46.855 --> 00:48.494
Yo, Crystal!

00:58.185 --> 00:59.813
Eddie, I mean, if you're
trying to date a locker

00:59.814 --> 01:01.131
you got it going on.

01:06.068 --> 01:07.554
d- Do you smell that?

01:07.966 --> 01:09.489
Yeah, I was trying
to be polite

01:09.490 --> 01:10.823
and not say nothing,
but, man...

01:10.824 --> 01:12.101
Now, you know that's

01:12.102 --> 01:12.915
not me.

01:15.649 --> 01:17.201
Ben Sturkey!
Ben Sturkey!

01:24.082 --> 01:25.077
Sorry.

01:28.224 --> 01:29.869
Does that guy
ever take a shower?!

01:29.870 --> 01:31.951
I got second-hand stink here!

01:32.921 --> 01:34.446
Try having him
in science.

01:34.447 --> 01:36.241
You know, my brother's hamster
smells better

01:36.242 --> 01:37.768
and it died two weeks ago.

01:38.397 --> 01:40.002
Cuddles died?!

01:40.003 --> 01:42.108
Yeah, he died
the same way he lived--

01:42.109 --> 01:43.443
on the wheel.

01:49.055 --> 01:50.808
This is going to be great.

01:54.548 --> 01:59.418
I just saw Ben Sturkey
put his arms around me.

02:00.597 --> 02:01.613
Do your visions

02:01.614 --> 02:02.665
usually
come true?

02:04.837 --> 02:05.925
Yeah.

02:09.455 --> 02:10.537
All right, class

02:10.538 --> 02:12.650
your science projects
are due on Monday

02:12.651 --> 02:14.030
so, I'm going
to assign each of you

02:14.031 --> 02:14.852
a partner.

02:16.297 --> 02:17.755
Partners?!

02:17.756 --> 02:19.950
Do you really think
that would be a fair evaluation

02:19.951 --> 02:22.193
of our individual contributions
to the world of science?

02:22.194 --> 02:23.248
I'm just saying.

02:25.801 --> 02:28.032
Yes, I do, and
I'm just saying.

02:30.711 --> 02:32.197
Well, what about Diane?

02:32.198 --> 02:33.875
'Cause you see
we have a chemistry

02:33.876 --> 02:35.265
which must work well
in science.

02:35.266 --> 02:36.705
I mean, chemistry,
science...

02:36.706 --> 02:38.277
Diane's with Leland.

02:38.278 --> 02:40.125
Okay. What about Tina?

02:40.126 --> 02:41.875
What about Cristina?
What about Robert?

02:41.876 --> 02:44.026
Raven,
I've already assigned partners.

02:44.812 --> 02:46.025
I know.

02:46.026 --> 02:47.543
Ben Sturkey.

02:48.315 --> 02:50.187
Well, I had you with Kristen

02:50.188 --> 02:52.569
but that's
a much better idea.

02:53.049 --> 02:55.260
Ben, you're with Raven.

02:55.261 --> 02:57.221
Score!

02:59.845 --> 03:02.457
This is going to be great,
partner.

03:57.328 --> 03:58.788
Yep, that's me.

04:07.898 --> 04:09.846
Now, we're supposed to make
a model with a molecule

04:09.847 --> 04:12.074
but that's too easy,
so I'm thinking

04:12.075 --> 04:14.344
an entire DNA strand.

04:14.345 --> 04:16.112
So, what do you say,
partner?

04:16.113 --> 04:17.033
Let's get psyched, huh?

04:17.034 --> 04:18.144
High fives!

04:22.826 --> 04:24.615
Oh, by the way

04:24.616 --> 04:27.830
the individually wrapped
little brownies on your plates

04:27.831 --> 04:30.696
yes, that was provided
by yours truly, moi.

04:32.287 --> 04:33.755
I know what you're thinking--

04:33.756 --> 04:36.760
that I'm just trying
to unload Stinky Sturkey.

04:36.761 --> 04:38.131
I mean, Ben Stinky.

04:38.132 --> 04:39.390
Stinky Stinky.

04:41.896 --> 04:44.407
You know, you could at least
give back the brownies.

04:49.056 --> 04:50.708
This one's missing a bite.

04:53.196 --> 04:54.411
Thank you.

04:55.980 --> 04:58.232
I've always
thought you were so cute

04:58.662 --> 05:02.644
and, well, I'd love to go
to the carnival with you.

05:17.726 --> 05:20.984
I just love
sloppy joe day, y'all.

05:20.985 --> 05:22.188
That's all that is.

05:24.896 --> 05:26.236
Eddie.

05:28.358 --> 05:30.429
Okay, I'm going to need you
to wipe off that face

05:30.430 --> 05:31.755
before I talk to it.

05:35.756 --> 05:37.375
Any luck
finding a new partner?

05:37.376 --> 05:39.364
No, and what am I going to do?!

05:39.365 --> 05:41.708
I mean, this project is worth
25% of my grade

05:41.709 --> 05:42.897
and I can't get
a good grade

05:42.898 --> 05:44.075
if I can't breathe.

05:45.469 --> 05:47.495
EDDIE:
"Head Cold" Kenny.

05:47.496 --> 05:49.059
He can't smell anything.

05:55.455 --> 05:56.983
Hello, Kenny.

06:02.037 --> 06:03.990
Come on, Eddie, get up.

06:03.991 --> 06:05.260
You can do it.

06:05.261 --> 06:06.482
Do it!

06:06.483 --> 06:07.826
Do it!

06:08.126 --> 06:10.906
Sure, I'll partner
with Ben Sturkey.

06:12.061 --> 06:14.612
You will? Really?

06:15.771 --> 06:17.302
Okay, give me a moment.

06:17.303 --> 06:18.629
I will be okay.

06:19.791 --> 06:21.016
I'm up.

06:21.810 --> 06:23.140
Okay, I'm down.

06:24.008 --> 06:25.314
I'm up.

06:26.184 --> 06:27.279
Cool.

06:28.077 --> 06:29.227
Zipper check.

06:30.172 --> 06:32.588
Okay. That was a close one.

06:44.326 --> 06:47.196
So...
want to go to the carnival?

06:53.165 --> 06:55.057
Hey, want to go
to the carnival?

06:55.058 --> 06:56.273
Oops, sorry, I'm taken.

06:56.274 --> 06:57.673
You could ask Crystal.

06:57.674 --> 06:59.891
Oops, sorry,
she's taken, too.

07:01.056 --> 07:02.396
Yeah!

07:04.882 --> 07:06.810
Eddie, you know you got
a piece of cole slaw

07:06.811 --> 07:07.937
on your head, right?

07:08.567 --> 07:10.500
And I made it work for me.

07:11.609 --> 07:13.071
Yeah.

07:18.080 --> 07:19.856
Gross!

07:22.996 --> 07:24.025
What'd you see?

07:24.026 --> 07:26.169
Um, I just saw Crystal

07:26.170 --> 07:27.500
and she was pointing
at your face

07:27.501 --> 07:28.942
and really grossed out.

07:28.943 --> 07:30.773
What's wrong with my face?

07:30.774 --> 07:32.722
Okay, whatever it is,
she's just gon' freak.

07:33.098 --> 07:34.877
What am I going to do?!

07:34.878 --> 07:37.557
It's straight to bed for you,
young man.

07:37.558 --> 07:40.254
With that fever, you'll be out
for the rest of the week.

07:40.255 --> 07:41.690
D'orry.

07:43.048 --> 07:45.177
"D'orry?" That little

07:45.178 --> 07:45.858
stuffy-head thing

07:45.859 --> 07:46.997
was my last hope!

07:49.096 --> 07:50.426
Hey, partner.

07:53.338 --> 07:54.374
Okay, you know what?

07:54.375 --> 07:55.746
I'm just going to have
to come clean.

07:55.747 --> 07:56.843
I'm going to have to be honest

07:56.844 --> 07:58.138
and tell him
I can't work with him.

07:59.754 --> 08:01.145
Hey, Ben?

08:01.146 --> 08:02.990
Oh. Wow.

08:02.991 --> 08:04.187
Hey, you know what?

08:04.188 --> 08:06.725
I think I must have
pulled something.

08:08.496 --> 08:11.503
Hey, Ben, yeah, you know
what might help that?

08:11.504 --> 08:14.649
If you keep your arms
down by your sides really tight.

08:15.900 --> 08:17.648
Okay, and you know
what else

08:17.649 --> 08:20.046
might help that little
arm spasm that you just...?

08:20.047 --> 08:24.460
If you take
a really long, hot bath.

08:24.461 --> 08:27.255
With a big bar of soap. Oh!

08:29.826 --> 08:31.125
You know, that's a good idea

08:31.126 --> 08:32.972
but actually, this arm thing's
kind of working.

08:32.974 --> 08:33.770
So, what did you want?

08:33.772 --> 08:35.405
Oh, uh, hmm,
well, you know

08:35.405 --> 08:36.905
I just wanted
to talk to you.

08:36.907 --> 08:38.433
Oh, is it about
the project?

08:40.222 --> 08:42.480
Yeah, I mean,
I just cannot believe

08:42.481 --> 08:43.845
I'm partnered with you.

08:43.846 --> 08:44.900
Oh, I know!

08:44.901 --> 08:47.054
I still can't believe
that I get to work

08:47.055 --> 08:48.741
with the prettiest girl
in class.

08:52.130 --> 08:53.639
Oh, that's so sweet.

08:54.371 --> 08:55.990
You didn't have to say that.

08:55.991 --> 08:56.982
I mean, really.

08:56.983 --> 08:58.195
Oh, but I mean it.

08:58.196 --> 08:59.588
You're great.

08:59.589 --> 09:01.275
So, what did you
want to talk about?

09:02.324 --> 09:04.155
Um... you know

09:04.156 --> 09:07.282
I wanted to tell you
that you're great, too.

09:09.198 --> 09:10.259
Arms!

09:10.260 --> 09:11.488
Oh, right.

09:16.856 --> 09:18.873
Do I spy a pupil

09:18.874 --> 09:20.022
with a problem?

09:21.072 --> 09:22.640
Perhaps I can help.

09:23.241 --> 09:23.943
Possibly...

09:23.944 --> 09:24.836
You know what?

09:24.837 --> 09:26.061
It's a science thing

09:26.062 --> 09:29.829
and nothing you could spray,
I mean say, would help.

09:29.830 --> 09:31.013
Sorry.
Okay.

09:31.014 --> 09:33.364
But may I propose

09:33.365 --> 09:35.595
you talk
to your science teacher--

09:35.596 --> 09:38.358
Mrs. Depaulo, or is it Depallo?

09:38.359 --> 09:39.620
No, Depaulo.

09:39.621 --> 09:41.530
You know what?
We just call her

09:41.531 --> 09:43.260
"Teach." That's what

09:43.261 --> 09:44.153
we call her.

09:44.154 --> 09:45.505
And you know what?
I'm about to go

09:45.506 --> 09:47.488
see Teach right now.

09:47.489 --> 09:48.342
Buh-bye.

09:51.459 --> 09:52.601
"Teach."

09:56.326 --> 09:58.226
I wish I had a pet name.

10:03.679 --> 10:05.425
Mrs. Depaulo, do
you have a minute?

10:05.426 --> 10:07.655
Raven, I've been meaning
to talk to you.

10:07.656 --> 10:10.820
I'm so proud of the way you've
been working with Ben Sturkey.

10:10.821 --> 10:12.655
A lot of students
would have complained

10:12.656 --> 10:13.803
but not you.

10:13.804 --> 10:14.742
No.

10:14.743 --> 10:17.130
Now, what did you want
to see me about?

10:17.131 --> 10:19.315
Yeah, okay. Um...

10:20.926 --> 10:24.656
You know, I was wondering,
was it Depaulo, or Depollo?

10:25.125 --> 10:26.357
Depaulo.

10:26.358 --> 10:28.143
Okay. I thought so.

10:31.426 --> 10:33.277
That was almost too easy.

10:35.528 --> 10:36.342
Mrs. Depollo...

10:36.343 --> 10:37.224
Depaulo.

10:37.225 --> 10:38.541
Whatever. Ben stinks.

10:40.974 --> 10:42.387
Isn't that a little harsh?

10:42.388 --> 10:44.439
Ben's a nice guy,
don't get me wrong

10:44.440 --> 10:46.526
but ever since
I was just a little tyke

10:46.527 --> 10:48.641
um, I've been allergic to B.O.

10:50.021 --> 10:51.583
All right,
I don't go

10:51.584 --> 10:53.170
to sporting
events, gyms.

10:53.171 --> 10:54.625
You know, you
can ask my doctor.

10:54.626 --> 10:57.684
Well, this project
is a big part of your grade.

10:57.685 --> 10:59.555
And I really want
to do well in it.

10:59.556 --> 11:02.630
Okay. I won't force you
to work with Ben.

11:02.631 --> 11:04.074
I'm very...

11:05.862 --> 11:07.229
We got an "A."

11:10.365 --> 11:11.764
I'll have
to tell Ben...

11:11.765 --> 11:12.917
How much...

11:13.764 --> 11:16.979
...I am looking forward
to working with him.

11:16.980 --> 11:18.586
Did I tell you Ben's my boy?

11:18.587 --> 11:19.518
All right.

11:19.519 --> 11:20.949
But I thought he stinks.

11:22.456 --> 11:24.025
Now, Ms. Depaulo

11:24.026 --> 11:26.022
that's a little harsh,
don't you think?

11:26.023 --> 11:27.258
Shame on you.

11:39.904 --> 11:41.574
Hey, Ben, doesn't
that go up there?

11:41.575 --> 11:42.594
Oh, yeah.

11:46.202 --> 11:48.925
You know what, something is
on the back of your head.

11:48.926 --> 11:51.171
You better get it,
you hear?

11:53.038 --> 11:54.411
It was just your hair.

12:07.226 --> 12:10.095
Looks great...
keep up the good work.

12:10.096 --> 12:13.022
So glad to have you
in the house... come again soon.

12:13.023 --> 12:14.384
Oh, thanks,
Mrs. Baxter.

12:15.720 --> 12:17.287
Mom, you gotta
breathe sometime.

12:17.288 --> 12:18.383
Not in here.

12:22.759 --> 12:24.405
Hey, Corey,
what's with the snorkel?

12:24.406 --> 12:25.425
How do you breathe?

12:25.426 --> 12:26.077
I don't.

12:26.078 --> 12:27.438
That's kind of the point.

12:34.835 --> 12:36.978
I finally figured out
what was so gross about me

12:36.979 --> 12:38.199
in your vision...

12:39.526 --> 12:40.572
...this.

12:41.256 --> 12:43.080
You've got a bandage!

12:43.639 --> 12:45.290
Covering a huge zit.

12:45.291 --> 12:46.622
Hey, Eddie.

12:46.623 --> 12:48.610
Don't get up. You just
keep working right there.

12:48.611 --> 12:49.918
Kitchen.

12:57.840 --> 13:00.697
I mean, why don't I just tell
Crystal I cut myself shaving?

13:01.048 --> 13:02.739
Okay, 'cause if
she believes that

13:02.740 --> 13:04.912
you got to dump the girl
'cause she's kind of slow.

13:05.806 --> 13:08.409
No, no, he's got a little
mustache coming...

13:09.046 --> 13:10.581
Oh, no, I'm sorry.

13:10.582 --> 13:12.751
I'm thinking
of your friend Audrey.

13:14.002 --> 13:15.390
You think
it's funny?

13:15.391 --> 13:17.083
You think this...

13:17.084 --> 13:18.440
Ooh!
...is funny?

13:19.797 --> 13:22.053
Okay, I'm going to need you
to cover that back up.

13:24.853 --> 13:27.009
I appreciate
your concern, man...

13:27.010 --> 13:28.878
it's just a little nosebleed.

13:29.645 --> 13:31.173
I need him out of my house.

13:31.174 --> 13:33.230
But we haven't finished
our project.

13:33.231 --> 13:34.429
Here's an idea.

13:34.430 --> 13:35.958
Why don't you work at his house?

13:35.959 --> 13:38.273
No, no, no, uh-uh,
I cannot do that

13:38.274 --> 13:39.956
because, you see, I've
never met his family.

13:40.586 --> 13:42.107
He might be the clean one.

13:46.363 --> 13:48.011
Ooh, Daddy.

13:48.012 --> 13:49.760
The "Band-Aid
On the Zit" trick.

13:49.761 --> 13:52.960
So, what did you do,
cut yourself "shaving?"

13:52.961 --> 13:54.355
That's it.

13:54.356 --> 13:56.360
There's no way I'm going
to the carnival tomorrow.

13:56.361 --> 13:58.055
I'm calling Crystal and
saying I'm sick, Raven.

13:58.056 --> 13:58.987
No, you're not.

13:58.988 --> 13:59.923
See, what you're
going to do is

13:59.924 --> 14:00.894
you're going
to stick your face in there.

14:00.895 --> 14:02.127
It's going to suck
it all out.

14:02.807 --> 14:04.625
I'm not putting my
face in there.

14:04.626 --> 14:05.933
But you don't have to.

14:05.934 --> 14:08.303
Look, Crystal's not going
to care about that pimple.

14:08.304 --> 14:11.390
Sure, she'll see it, but then
she'll spend some time with you

14:11.391 --> 14:13.919
you'll make her laugh,
and soon she'll want to know

14:13.920 --> 14:16.312
about the man
behind the pimple.

14:19.926 --> 14:24.099
If she can find the man--
'cause that thing is nasty!

14:26.274 --> 14:28.585
You know, I've found the best
place to hide from them--

14:28.586 --> 14:29.738
in here.

14:51.016 --> 14:54.226
I can't... move... my face.

14:55.791 --> 14:58.859
That's because you were only
supposed to put it here.

14:59.712 --> 15:01.091
Just so you know

15:01.832 --> 15:06.342
I'm giving you
a really dirty look right now.

15:12.066 --> 15:14.023
28 minutes
and 19 seconds--

15:14.024 --> 15:17.246
that's how long I and my nose
have been in there.

15:17.713 --> 15:20.059
The good news--
I finished the project.

15:20.060 --> 15:22.275
The bad news--
we have to burn the couch.

15:26.626 --> 15:28.525
Have no fear, family!

15:28.526 --> 15:30.493
I'm going to blow
the stink away!

15:47.588 --> 15:49.393
My project's going
to get ruined.

15:49.394 --> 15:51.107
I cannot let that happen!

15:56.326 --> 15:59.278
I'm okay...
it's just the project

15:59.279 --> 16:01.451
but we can fix it tomorrow
after the carnival

16:01.452 --> 16:03.583
even if it takes
all night.

16:05.696 --> 16:06.961
All night.

16:08.045 --> 16:09.906
I feel a nosebleed
coming on.

16:22.184 --> 16:24.159
Um, hey, Ben...
it's so great

16:24.160 --> 16:26.090
that you volunteered to
help out with the dunk tank.

16:26.091 --> 16:28.421
Um, actually,
you volunteered me.

16:28.422 --> 16:30.530
Oh, yeah, that's right,
it's all for charity.

16:30.531 --> 16:31.801
It's all for charity.

16:33.596 --> 16:35.711
Oh, come on,
you throw like a girl!

16:42.726 --> 16:45.325
Lady, can you give
someone else a chance?

16:45.326 --> 16:48.142
No way. My baby wants it,
my baby's getting it.

16:48.143 --> 16:50.660
That big spotted dog
is coming down.

16:53.296 --> 16:54.840
You the man.

16:54.841 --> 16:56.580
Go Mama, go Mama

16:56.581 --> 16:58.852
Go Mama, go, go...

16:58.853 --> 17:00.485
Yes!

17:01.976 --> 17:04.060
Mom, can I have one of those?

17:04.060 --> 17:05.423
No.

17:05.852 --> 17:08.382
Ooh, nothing like an outdoor
barbecue grill

17:08.383 --> 17:09.942
to get the juices flowing.

17:09.943 --> 17:12.551
Mm, no.
I'm feeling luckier.

17:13.287 --> 17:14.307
Come on, Corey.

17:14.308 --> 17:16.017
Oh, we've got piping hot

17:16.018 --> 17:16.935
pork ribs

17:16.936 --> 17:18.063
Hamburger patties...

17:18.064 --> 17:19.367
and soda pop.

17:20.406 --> 17:22.598
Uh, I'll have a root beer.

17:25.826 --> 17:26.820
With a lid.

17:26.821 --> 17:28.049
Perfect!

17:37.356 --> 17:38.889
Hey, Raven

17:38.890 --> 17:40.125
have you seen Eddie?

17:40.126 --> 17:41.649
Crystal, I think
he's over there

17:41.650 --> 17:42.827
by the cotton
candy machine.

17:42.828 --> 17:43.365
Okay, thanks.

17:43.366 --> 17:44.430
No prob.

17:44.431 --> 17:46.655
I cannot keep doing this.

17:47.367 --> 17:48.326
Why not?

17:48.896 --> 17:51.360
Because... you told her
you'll meet her here.

17:51.361 --> 17:53.215
And you told me this
would be gone.

17:53.216 --> 17:55.225
What am I going to do, Rae?

17:55.226 --> 17:56.774
You know what, Eddie,
face it, okay?

17:56.775 --> 17:58.481
There's only one thing
you can do.

17:59.703 --> 18:02.260
Yes, it is
the magic of makeup.

18:02.261 --> 18:04.692
It's just so weird,
not to...

18:05.418 --> 18:07.278
Hey, that's amazing.

18:07.631 --> 18:08.997
You can't even see it. I know.

18:08.998 --> 18:12.727
So, what do you
really look like?

18:15.426 --> 18:17.228
You will never know.

18:27.126 --> 18:29.499
Can't you wimps hit anything?

18:38.065 --> 18:40.545
So, uh, what's your
favorite color?

18:40.546 --> 18:43.240
Well, it's between
periwinkle blue

18:43.241 --> 18:45.376
and seafoam green.

18:45.377 --> 18:47.446
Uh-huh. Mine, too.
Really?

18:47.447 --> 18:50.270
Yeah, we have a lot
in common, girl.

18:50.271 --> 18:53.229
Oh, uh, you got a
little mustard.

18:53.230 --> 18:54.885
Oh, let me knock
that out, baby.

18:54.886 --> 18:56.538
It's still there.
You know what?

19:00.926 --> 19:03.070
Gross!

19:04.276 --> 19:06.838
All right,
it's disgusting, I know.

19:08.764 --> 19:10.555
Eddie, get back here.

19:10.556 --> 19:12.460
Crystal, what is
wrong with you?

19:12.461 --> 19:13.660
It is just a pimple.

19:13.661 --> 19:14.536
So what?

19:14.537 --> 19:16.314
Eddie is a great guy.

19:16.315 --> 19:18.678
If we let little stupid stuff
like that get in the way

19:18.679 --> 19:20.288
we'd never get to know anybody.

19:20.289 --> 19:22.525
I mean, look, he spits

19:22.526 --> 19:24.411
but I know
he's a great teacher.

19:24.412 --> 19:27.291
Look, she has a mouth
full of braces

19:27.292 --> 19:28.923
but she is the fastest girl

19:28.924 --> 19:29.821
on the track team.

19:29.822 --> 19:31.580
And he smells.

19:31.581 --> 19:33.098
All right,
but he's good in science

19:33.099 --> 19:34.790
and he's a nice... guy.

19:38.702 --> 19:42.789
Ooh... who deserves
to be treated a lot better.

19:45.622 --> 19:47.068
All for a stupid grade.

19:52.843 --> 19:54.192
Look, Eddie,
you know what?

19:54.193 --> 19:56.143
I don't care about
a stupid pimple.

19:56.144 --> 19:58.405
It's just the makeup
that's weird.

19:58.406 --> 20:03.146
Well, I only did it
so that you would like me.

20:04.241 --> 20:06.138
Eddie, I wouldn't have
come here today

20:06.139 --> 20:07.430
if I didn't like you.

20:07.431 --> 20:08.590
For real?

20:08.591 --> 20:09.655
Yes.

20:09.656 --> 20:12.864
Can we just start
over, maybe?

20:12.865 --> 20:15.331
Well, I really got to think
about this. Yes!

20:16.154 --> 20:16.993
Okay.

20:16.994 --> 20:18.031
Hey.

20:18.032 --> 20:19.415
I'm still dry!

20:19.416 --> 20:21.510
Must be some kind
of record, huh?

20:21.511 --> 20:23.448
Yeah. Uh, Ben?

20:25.714 --> 20:27.415
Could you please
come on out of there?

20:27.416 --> 20:29.090
I kind of need to talk
to you about something.

20:29.091 --> 20:30.595
Oh, sure. What's up?

20:30.596 --> 20:32.613
Well, it's kind of hard to say.

20:38.296 --> 20:40.189
I am so sorry.

20:40.190 --> 20:41.812
That was a total
accident.

20:41.813 --> 20:43.388
Why is this water all soapy?

20:43.389 --> 20:45.097
Oh, okay.

20:45.098 --> 20:47.090
The water's soapy
because I put soap in it.

20:47.091 --> 20:49.126
Why... why would you do that?

20:49.539 --> 20:51.295
Because I'm a real jerk.

20:51.296 --> 20:54.160
Oh, no, you're not a jerk,
you're my friend.

20:54.161 --> 20:55.501
Okay.

20:55.502 --> 20:58.042
So, as a friend, here goes...

20:58.043 --> 20:59.469
Ben, you stink.

20:59.470 --> 21:01.030
All right,
I'm sorry.

21:01.902 --> 21:03.037
I do?

21:03.038 --> 21:06.138
I mean, hasn't anybody ever
told you that before?

21:06.139 --> 21:08.649
Well, my mom, but I mean,
that's just my mom.

21:08.650 --> 21:10.126
She thinks my dad smells, too.

21:10.906 --> 21:12.217
Interesting.

21:14.066 --> 21:17.912
Well, I... I mean, I guess
I could just shower more.

21:17.913 --> 21:18.857
It's no big deal.

21:18.858 --> 21:20.075
Great!

21:21.356 --> 21:23.842
Ben, if that's what you
want, 'cause you know...

21:23.843 --> 21:25.979
Hmph! I don't care if
you take a shower.

21:25.980 --> 21:28.268
Well, then I won't.

21:29.245 --> 21:30.484
All right.

21:42.547 --> 21:43.643
Son, when you have

21:43.644 --> 21:45.963
a problem, and people
don't point it out

21:45.964 --> 21:47.850
you can lose perspective.

21:47.851 --> 21:49.295
If I had a problem

21:49.296 --> 21:51.842
I would not want people
to beat around the bush.

21:51.843 --> 21:53.563
Son, I have one word

21:53.564 --> 21:55.760
which will change your life
forever--

21:55.761 --> 21:57.874
anti-perspirant.

22:07.506 --> 22:09.206
Pathetic.
