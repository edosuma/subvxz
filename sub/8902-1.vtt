00:19.200 --> 00:21.509
[J the Bulgarian symphony orchestra:

04:11.320 --> 04:14.630
Nurse Evelyn. Nurse Evelyn!

04:14.800 --> 04:17.712
I have a message for you. In english.

04:36.920 --> 04:39.354
Now look, here's the list
of all the patients

04:39.560 --> 04:41.676
we've had in the ward in the last month.

05:57.720 --> 06:00.553
- You're Alexandria?
- Yes.

06:00.720 --> 06:04.315
Your... your note came in
and landed on my lap.

06:04.520 --> 06:05.953
I couldn't understand it,

06:06.120 --> 06:10.079
- it's written in gibberish.
- You didn't understand it?

06:10.240 --> 06:12.117
It's not for you.

06:15.400 --> 06:17.868
My name is Roy.

06:20.160 --> 06:22.958
- How'd you hurt your arm?
- I fell.

06:23.120 --> 06:26.795
- Me too.
- I was picking oranges.

06:29.120 --> 06:30.792
Is that so?

06:33.200 --> 06:34.872
How do you go to the potty?

06:35.040 --> 06:38.112
I don't.
They let me go right here.

06:38.280 --> 06:40.748
- In bed?
- That's true.

06:40.920 --> 06:42.956
I don't believe.

06:44.240 --> 06:46.549
Hey, Alexandria.

06:46.720 --> 06:49.951
Hey, did you know you're named after
Alexander the great,

06:50.120 --> 06:53.317
who was the greatest warrior
who ever lived.

06:53.520 --> 06:57.115
Yes, and my note is not in gibberish,
it's in english.

06:57.280 --> 06:59.350
Hey, I can see you.
Come on out here.

06:59.560 --> 07:02.870
- Whoa, whoa.
- I can see you hiding.

07:04.360 --> 07:08.876
Alexandria.

07:10.240 --> 07:13.198
Hey, did you know he was also
looking for a message?

07:16.000 --> 07:18.958
He's lost.

07:21.800 --> 07:23.711
He almost died.

07:24.680 --> 07:26.352
Separated from his army.

07:27.720 --> 07:30.188
Did he find the message?

07:30.360 --> 07:32.669
- What?
- Did he find the message?

07:32.840 --> 07:34.717
Alexandria the great.

07:34.880 --> 07:37.678
Ah, you know what? I'll tell you.
Just come in here.

07:39.320 --> 07:41.436
No, come on.
Grab that chair right there.

07:44.800 --> 07:47.394
All right. Don't break your other arm.

07:52.600 --> 07:54.431
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

08:00.080 --> 08:03.277
- What's in your box?
- Things I like.

08:05.000 --> 08:06.877
Things you stole?

08:07.040 --> 08:08.189
No.

08:10.000 --> 08:14.232
- A photo.
- Where'd you get the elephant?

08:15.880 --> 08:19.111
- My friend gave it to me at work.
- Hmm.

08:20.520 --> 08:22.158
He's from India.

08:23.680 --> 08:24.715
Look.

08:24.880 --> 08:27.997
This is my horse.

08:29.600 --> 08:31.830
And this is my father.

08:32.000 --> 08:35.708
Yeah? He's got the
same gap in his teeth.

08:35.880 --> 08:39.509
- It must run in the family.
- Yeah. And here is my house.

08:39.679 --> 08:41.193
- Oh, yeah?
- It was my house.

08:41.360 --> 08:43.669
- What happened?
- They burn it.

08:43.840 --> 08:47.549
- Who burned it?
- Angry people.

08:49.320 --> 08:50.992
Well, I'm sorry to hear that.

08:51.160 --> 08:54.835
- Mmm?
- I said I'm sorry to hear that.

08:55.000 --> 08:56.353
Angry people.

08:56.560 --> 08:58.994
I'm just sorry.
I'm sorry your house got burned.

08:59.160 --> 09:01.355
Why did Alexander

09:01.560 --> 09:06.759
didn't go from that buildings
on his horse?

09:07.560 --> 09:09.915
- If him was lost...
- What?

09:10.080 --> 09:13.197
Why did Alexander didn't go from

09:13.360 --> 09:19.549
that middle of the buildings,
from that buildings, on his horse?

09:20.440 --> 09:22.112
Well...

09:23.720 --> 09:27.508
First of all, he didn't have a horse...

09:27.680 --> 09:30.592
Because his horse
was killed in a battle.

09:32.800 --> 09:35.268
And he wasn't in the middle
of any old buildings,

09:35.440 --> 09:41.709
he was lost in the middle
of a vast desert full of orange sand,

09:41.880 --> 09:44.269
with only a handful of men.

09:46.320 --> 09:48.880
But they didn't have any water.

10:38.240 --> 10:41.676
My lord, all hope is lost.

10:41.840 --> 10:44.798
It seems your mighty army
shall finally be conquered.

10:44.960 --> 10:46.951
Not by the persians,

10:47.120 --> 10:50.829
but by our own greed
and gluttony for water.

10:51.000 --> 10:54.959
This helmet contains our last supply.

10:55.120 --> 10:58.430
Oh, king, I believe your wisdom
shall save us all.

11:07.640 --> 11:09.312
- Why?
- Why?

11:09.520 --> 11:10.839
Why?

11:12.160 --> 11:13.559
Why?

11:15.240 --> 11:18.357
Well, because there wasn't
enough water for all of them...

11:18.560 --> 11:21.074
- Hmm?
- It was Alexander the great's way of...

11:21.240 --> 11:24.198
Showing his army
that they were all equal. That...

11:24.360 --> 11:27.557
- That's stupid.
- Wh... what would you do better?

11:27.720 --> 11:30.154
Was Alexander throw the water

11:30.320 --> 11:34.916
instead to give
every soldier a little bit.

11:41.040 --> 11:44.555
Hey, come back tomorrow and I'm
going to tell you a different story.

11:44.720 --> 11:48.679
- An epic tale of love and revenge...
- Mm-hmm.

11:48.840 --> 11:50.910
- You know what epic means?
- No.

11:51.080 --> 11:53.719
I still got tightness here.
It's like I can't...

11:53.880 --> 11:57.919
It means a really long story.
And it's set in India.

11:58.080 --> 12:01.993
- All right, go on.
- I want you to examine me.

12:02.160 --> 12:04.993
You personally.
I'm not very well.

12:06.840 --> 12:08.159
Do you have a cigarette?

12:13.160 --> 12:15.276
The swelling seems down.

12:17.240 --> 12:19.674
I know how much it hurts.

12:19.840 --> 12:24.868
Someone should.

12:25.040 --> 12:29.033
In the next couple of weeks the pain
should abate, then one more operation.

12:29.200 --> 12:30.553
Like the last one?

12:30.720 --> 12:33.712
This is going to take
effort on your part. Know that?

12:33.880 --> 12:35.836
See?

12:38.880 --> 12:40.438
Ahh.

13:22.640 --> 13:23.993
Come on, then.

13:45.440 --> 13:48.159
- Be back before lunch.
- Ok.

14:06.440 --> 14:09.352
Alexandria. Get away from that ice.

14:09.560 --> 14:11.391
I see you. Get away from that ice.

14:11.600 --> 14:14.034
You're gonna get sick.
I want you to go play. Go.

14:14.200 --> 14:17.829
Next time I'll glue your lips to this
and carry you away.

14:23.960 --> 14:26.793
You're lucky it was
just a horse that got killed.

14:26.960 --> 14:30.430
Jumping off a train bridge
was suicide, too.

14:30.640 --> 14:32.517
If you were trying to impress her...

14:32.680 --> 14:36.719
- What did you...
- Sinclair already did a better job.

14:36.880 --> 14:39.075
You know, the actor.

14:40.200 --> 14:42.270
- The leading man.
- I know who he is.

14:44.160 --> 14:47.152
Every cloud has a silver lining,
that's for sure.

14:47.320 --> 14:51.074
- Take another card. That is a queen.
- Before my accident...

14:51.240 --> 14:53.231
The queen of hearts.

14:53.400 --> 14:56.198
I've had my leg
hacked off by savages,

14:56.360 --> 14:59.670
mangled by chariots,
sawed off by lumberjacks.

14:59.840 --> 15:04.197
I've even had a harpoon through it.
I'm working all the time.

15:09.000 --> 15:11.116
That is the two of spades.

15:11.280 --> 15:13.669
The studio is
trying to do right by you.

15:13.840 --> 15:16.274
- Mr sabatini.
- Take the money.

15:16.440 --> 15:19.796
Anyway, gags are not for you, Roy.

15:19.960 --> 15:22.269
- You're a college man.
- It wasn't me.

15:22.440 --> 15:25.671
- One cripple to another...
- It was little girls.

15:25.840 --> 15:30.231
- I didn't throw orange at you.
- No woman is worth suicide.

15:30.840 --> 15:33.035
Guy's a movie star,
for Christ's sake.

15:48.440 --> 15:51.034
Was you friend a pirate?

15:54.160 --> 15:56.515
Was your friend a pirate?

15:57.880 --> 15:58.915
Sometimes.

16:00.840 --> 16:03.035
Is that how he hurt his leg?

16:04.000 --> 16:08.391
No, he...
He does tricks for pictures.

16:08.600 --> 16:10.955
You know, flickers.

16:11.120 --> 16:13.190
- Hm?
- Moving pictures.

16:14.080 --> 16:18.596
- I never seen one.
- Ah, you're not missing much.

16:18.760 --> 16:21.228
Is that what you do, like your friend?

16:22.960 --> 16:25.872
- Just once.
- Hmm.

16:28.080 --> 16:30.389
Will you tell me the story now?

16:31.720 --> 16:34.359
- What story?
- The epic.

16:37.920 --> 16:39.592
All right.

16:41.600 --> 16:43.158
All right. Close your eyes.

16:46.400 --> 16:47.435
What do you see?

16:49.560 --> 16:50.879
Nothing.

16:53.600 --> 16:58.435
Rub 'em. Can you see the stars?

16:58.640 --> 17:01.632
Yes.

17:01.800 --> 17:04.314
It was a starry night.

17:04.520 --> 17:09.036
Four men waited impatiently
on a small island,

17:09.200 --> 17:12.032
surrounded by a calm sea.

17:12.200 --> 17:15.829
But that calmness was deceptive.

17:20.400 --> 17:25.792
For, at that moment,
an Indian with a bandaged thigh

17:25.960 --> 17:27.188
swam towards them.

17:40.640 --> 17:45.919
Luigi... is what true?

17:46.080 --> 17:50.631
Governor odious will execute
your twin brother tomorrow morning.

17:51.560 --> 17:53.630
My poor brother.

17:59.760 --> 18:02.593
In all, there were five of them.

18:02.760 --> 18:08.198
They had only one thing in common,
a hatred of governor odious.

18:10.000 --> 18:14.994
The first was an ex-slave, oftta benga.

18:21.920 --> 18:25.674
He and his brother
were born into slavery

18:25.840 --> 18:29.958
only to fill the coffers
of the evil governor odious.

18:32.240 --> 18:36.119
One day, while toiling in the fields...

18:49.520 --> 18:54.310
Heartbroken at his brother's death,
he freed the slaves

18:54.520 --> 18:57.990
and swore that he would be responsible
for governor odious' death.

19:02.240 --> 19:06.916
- I like him.
- Then, there was the Indian,

19:07.080 --> 19:10.993
who, whenever anxious,
always stroked his brow.

19:15.040 --> 19:17.554
The Indian was supposedly married

19:17.720 --> 19:21.838
to the most beautiful squaw
in the world,

19:22.000 --> 19:24.195
yet nobody had seen her.

19:24.840 --> 19:29.118
To verify this,
odious disguised himself as a leper.

19:29.280 --> 19:33.558
But when he saw her reflection,
he was smitten.

19:37.320 --> 19:41.916
Locking the doors to his wigwam,
the Indian stood guard.

19:42.080 --> 19:45.993
Little did he know,
he was guarding an empty home.

19:46.160 --> 19:51.075
For his wife had already been kidnapped
by the evil governor odious.

19:52.800 --> 19:55.872
But the squaw refused
to show herself to him,

19:56.040 --> 20:00.352
so odious had her thrown
into the labyrinth of despair.

20:05.080 --> 20:08.709
Eventually she realised
there was only one way out.

20:24.360 --> 20:26.078
While mouming his wife's death,

20:26.240 --> 20:29.437
the Indian took a blood oath
never to look at another squaw,

20:29.640 --> 20:33.553
and that he would be responsible
for governor odious' death.

20:38.200 --> 20:40.191
I like him, too.

20:40.360 --> 20:44.319
Luigi was an explosive expert.

20:46.880 --> 20:49.758
When odious heard about
the power of his new bombs,

20:49.920 --> 20:52.992
he had him publicly banished.

20:53.160 --> 20:54.309
On his return,

20:54.520 --> 20:59.435
Luigi discovered that everybody hid
from him, because even speaking to him

20:59.640 --> 21:02.234
was punishable by death.

21:02.400 --> 21:05.836
But when his own priest
refused to hear his confession,

21:06.000 --> 21:08.992
Luigi swore...

21:09.160 --> 21:13.153
That he would be responsible
for governor odious' death.

21:17.280 --> 21:21.671
Next, was the english naturalist,

21:21.840 --> 21:27.233
Charles Darwin.
He loved all living things.

21:27.400 --> 21:33.236
Creatures, plants... everything alive.

21:34.440 --> 21:38.797
Darwin was always accompanied
by his shy, brilliant, colleague,

21:38.960 --> 21:40.154
Wallace the monkey.

21:40.320 --> 21:42.629
What is that, Wallace?

21:44.160 --> 21:45.832
I don't know why flamingos are pink.

21:46.000 --> 21:50.152
Even though they had developed
many theories together...

21:51.440 --> 21:53.749
They were still
looking for something.

21:53.920 --> 21:56.036
What?

21:56.200 --> 22:01.638
- Butterfly.
- That's a good guess.

22:01.800 --> 22:04.951
In fact, a very specific butterfly...

22:05.600 --> 22:09.388
Called americana exotica.

22:10.560 --> 22:13.791
One day, odious sent them a dead one.

22:20.360 --> 22:22.191
Butterfly reef.

22:24.400 --> 22:27.949
This odious, it's, um...

22:28.120 --> 22:32.272
- Bad man?
- Oh, yeah.

22:33.320 --> 22:35.709
Butterfly reef.

22:35.880 --> 22:39.316
That's where governor odious
chose to banish our heroes.

22:41.160 --> 22:43.116
To mock them.

22:43.920 --> 22:46.514
Hoping, that in
their fight for survival,

22:46.680 --> 22:49.274
they would devour each other.

22:50.640 --> 22:53.518
So the buccaneers were trapped
on this island.

22:53.680 --> 22:56.240
What means a buccaneer?

22:56.400 --> 22:58.277
Well, it's like a pirate.

22:58.440 --> 23:01.238
Pirate and buccaneer,
it's like the same thing.

23:01.400 --> 23:03.436
But I don't like pirate stories.

23:05.040 --> 23:07.315
You're the one who asked
for a pirate story.

23:07.520 --> 23:09.351
Mm-mmm. No.

23:09.560 --> 23:11.710
- Yes you did.
- Mm-mmm.

23:12.720 --> 23:16.349
I just wanted to know if your friend
was, was a pirate.

23:16.560 --> 23:20.394
- Why?
- Because he has just one leg.

23:21.560 --> 23:23.232
Oh! Right.

23:24.640 --> 23:26.517
Well, yeah. It's not a pirate story.

23:26.680 --> 23:29.319
- It's a story about bandits.
- Mmm.

23:29.520 --> 23:33.195
In fact, our masked hero
couldn't even swim.

23:34.800 --> 23:37.314
I need to learn to swim.

23:41.200 --> 23:45.876
Finally, very little was known
about the gap-toothed masked bandit.

23:46.040 --> 23:49.350
- Like my father?
- Yes, your father.

23:51.400 --> 23:55.359
Except that he and his twin brother,
the blue bandit,

23:55.560 --> 23:59.189
had escaped execution
from the Spanish governor odious.

24:00.240 --> 24:04.518
Knowing that their chances of survival
were better apart,

24:04.680 --> 24:06.830
the two brothers separated,

24:07.000 --> 24:10.390
swearing that they would kill
governor odious.

24:15.200 --> 24:17.873
We must conceive a plan.

24:18.600 --> 24:22.639
I need to get off this island
and rescue my twin brother.

24:27.840 --> 24:29.671
What?

24:29.840 --> 24:31.717
What?

24:34.320 --> 24:35.548
All elephants?

24:46.080 --> 24:47.149
I say, we...

24:54.160 --> 24:56.116
I have an idea.

25:29.520 --> 25:33.593
Darwin! That was a great ideal!

25:50.840 --> 25:52.512
Come on, otta benga!

26:04.520 --> 26:06.272
Goodbye, my beautiful friend!

26:06.440 --> 26:08.954
Have a nice swim!

26:14.920 --> 26:18.674
Darwin! You are a genius!

26:18.840 --> 26:23.118
- Much obliged.
- Where do you get these ideas?

27:01.720 --> 27:03.790
What is it, my friend?

27:47.600 --> 27:53.197
How sad. The tortures of this world
have driven the poor man mad.

27:53.360 --> 27:57.717
Not true. He said he has
been sent by his mystic cult...

28:00.400 --> 28:03.995
To help us against governor odious
and his Spanish henchmen.

28:05.920 --> 28:09.037
This region was once a lush forest,

28:09.200 --> 28:12.158
alive with birds and sacred trees...

28:16.200 --> 28:18.270
But odious had them all burned down.

28:18.440 --> 28:23.275
He also says the birds
are safe inside his belly.

28:23.440 --> 28:27.035
But we must take care,
for only fittest shall survive.

28:27.200 --> 28:30.715
Tell him we have no use of a mystic.

28:33.920 --> 28:35.717
We are on a dangerous mission.

28:37.440 --> 28:40.910
We need to hurry to the fort
to save my twin brother.

28:41.080 --> 28:43.150
He will only slow us down.

28:48.360 --> 28:52.239
Fish, sefsior.

28:52.400 --> 28:55.039
Pescado!

28:58.200 --> 29:00.668
Pescado, serior, pescado!

30:25.040 --> 30:28.112
Stand aside, my friend.
Before you say "kaboom"...

30:29.240 --> 30:31.196
I have this door open.

31:14.240 --> 31:17.198
Forgive me, wise mystic,
for my disrespect.

31:18.080 --> 31:21.993
Undoubtedly, you have a flair
for warmongering.

31:23.160 --> 31:28.598
It would be my honour if you
consider joining us on our quest.

31:31.640 --> 31:33.517
We must save your brother!

31:42.640 --> 31:44.278
But first...

31:48.680 --> 31:49.874
A little test.

31:50.040 --> 31:52.918
- You can't stop there.
- I just wanna play a little game.

31:53.080 --> 31:56.436
I want you to go outside
and touch one of my toes.

31:56.640 --> 32:00.110
No, tell me the story.
What happened with the blue bandit?

32:00.280 --> 32:03.716
No, it won't take long. Just go
outside and touch one of my toes.

32:03.880 --> 32:05.359
Ok.

32:10.240 --> 32:12.629
- I'm touching your little toe.
- No.

32:12.800 --> 32:16.793
No, please don't tell me which toe
you're touching. I gotta guess.

32:16.960 --> 32:19.235
That's the whole point of the game.

32:19.400 --> 32:21.675
- All right...
- Uh-huh. I'm touching one.

32:27.040 --> 32:28.758
I'm touching one.

32:31.200 --> 32:32.952
You're touching my big toe?

32:34.840 --> 32:37.559
- Mm-hmm.
- Are you telling the truth?

32:38.600 --> 32:40.238
Mm-hmm.

32:43.520 --> 32:45.192
You can look.

32:48.360 --> 32:49.998
Great.

32:50.880 --> 32:53.235
Oh, I got that?

32:53.400 --> 32:56.437
What happened?
What happened with his brother?

32:56.640 --> 32:58.631
- Did he save him?
- No, no, no, no.

32:58.800 --> 33:01.030
- Were you telling a story?
- Uh-huh.

33:01.200 --> 33:04.033
No, no, no. Were you
telling the truth just now?

33:04.200 --> 33:06.839
Ye... no. I was telling the truth.

33:07.000 --> 33:09.514
You just said no,
you weren't telling the truth.

33:09.680 --> 33:11.238
No, I tell it.

33:11.400 --> 33:13.960
- Were you telling the truth?
- Yeah.

33:14.120 --> 33:16.759
- When you just touched my toe?
- Uh-huh.

33:19.080 --> 33:21.389
- You little liar.
- No.

33:24.240 --> 33:27.198
Alexandria, were you lying to me?

33:28.080 --> 33:30.071
I touch your big toe.

33:31.360 --> 33:32.873
We need to hurry!

33:34.400 --> 33:36.789
Do you want me
to finish the story?

33:38.560 --> 33:41.996
The masked bandit arrived
at the chandelier hall too late.

33:44.040 --> 33:46.838
Odious had already
tortured his brother and crew...

33:47.920 --> 33:49.638
And hung them.

34:06.880 --> 34:08.632
All right, that's it.

34:08.800 --> 34:11.757
It's not a circus.
It's not a playground for all your...

34:11.920 --> 34:14.831
Please! Are you listening to me?

34:15.000 --> 34:16.194
Get otta here!

34:17.239 --> 34:18.275
You leave her alone.

34:18.440 --> 34:21.273
- Come here, baby.
- Get off! Goddamn...

34:21.440 --> 34:24.955
Aw, no, no, no, sweetheart.

34:25.120 --> 34:27.395
Come here, come here. Come on.

35:26.080 --> 35:29.516
- Dad? Dad?
- What do you want?

35:29.680 --> 35:32.274
- He's doing it again.
- Stop that? Leave him alone!

36:01.920 --> 36:04.195
- What's that?
- Food.

36:04.360 --> 36:07.352
- Where'd you get it?
- The chapel.

36:12.720 --> 36:16.349
I'm sorry I shouted at you.

36:16.560 --> 36:19.836
- I was angry.
- No problem.

36:20.840 --> 36:23.195
- Are you trying to save my soul?
- Hmm?

36:23.360 --> 36:25.271
Are you trying to save my soul?

36:27.640 --> 36:29.437
- Did you understand me?
- What?

36:29.640 --> 36:31.392
Did you understand what I meant?

36:31.600 --> 36:32.828
What you said?

36:33.000 --> 36:35.958
I said, "are you trying
to save my soul"?

36:36.120 --> 36:38.759
- Give me that.
- What mean that?

36:38.920 --> 36:40.592
The eucharist. It's, uh...

36:42.440 --> 36:43.668
What?

36:43.840 --> 36:45.956
The eucharist. The thing you gave me.

36:46.120 --> 36:47.712
It's a...

36:47.880 --> 36:50.314
- It saves your soul.
- Hmm?

36:50.520 --> 36:53.159
The thing I give you... what?

36:54.080 --> 36:59.791
The little piece of bread that
you just gave me, it saves your soul.

37:00.680 --> 37:02.955
- What? What?
- Are you worried about me?

37:03.120 --> 37:05.509
- What?
- It saves your soul.

37:05.680 --> 37:08.194
- Do you know what soul means?
- No.

37:08.360 --> 37:11.193
- It's like strength.
- Hmm.

37:13.120 --> 37:17.238
Why does the old man
keep his teeth in a glass at night?

37:19.240 --> 37:22.232
It's where he keeps his strength.

37:22.400 --> 37:24.152
His spirit.

37:24.320 --> 37:27.949
His spirit is in those teeth.

37:31.240 --> 37:32.832
Yeah.

37:33.000 --> 37:35.116
Oh, you're missing a little strength.

37:36.760 --> 37:39.718
- Right in the front of your mouth.
- Mm-mmm.

37:42.160 --> 37:44.549
The chapel's in the main block,
isn't it?

37:44.720 --> 37:47.393
Yes. What happened
with the black bandit?

37:49.520 --> 37:50.999
I'm sorry.

37:53.200 --> 37:54.599
It's ok.

37:57.840 --> 38:00.877
They keep the medicine
in the main block, don't they?

38:01.040 --> 38:02.314
Yes.

38:22.120 --> 38:26.671
That which has been taken from me
can never be replaced.

38:28.000 --> 38:29.274
My brother.

38:29.440 --> 38:32.830
- Why he speaks like this?
- He's your father.

38:33.000 --> 38:34.991
But my father's dead.

38:35.680 --> 38:37.318
What?

38:38.600 --> 38:41.512
Ok. How do you
want him to speak?

38:41.680 --> 38:44.433
I think of all the joys we had.

38:44.640 --> 38:46.631
Normal, like you.

38:46.800 --> 38:49.155
I could have saved you,
but I was weak.

38:51.240 --> 38:54.789
My grief has gone
blood-red with revenge.

38:56.640 --> 38:58.995
I'm stronger now.

39:00.920 --> 39:05.550
I will search the four corners
of this earth, find governor odious

39:05.720 --> 39:07.358
and joyously kill him.

39:10.400 --> 39:15.872
By the blue bandit's honour I swear,
I will annihilate him...

39:16.040 --> 39:18.349
And everything that he loves.

39:24.200 --> 39:27.670
I will destroy him!

39:27.840 --> 39:32.231
I will destroy him!
I will destroy him!

39:32.400 --> 39:35.551
I will destroy him! Destroy him!

39:37.360 --> 39:40.113
And every Spanish thing.

39:41.400 --> 39:44.233
I thought he was Spanish?

39:44.400 --> 39:48.075
No... he was French.

39:48.240 --> 39:50.674
Are you with me, bandits?

39:51.560 --> 39:53.630
Oui, mon capitaine.

40:12.760 --> 40:15.274
Darwin!

40:15.440 --> 40:17.590
Which way to governor odious?

40:18.640 --> 40:23.430
I tell him a-not to put
the map with the bugs.

40:24.280 --> 40:27.113
- Are we lost?
- Sorry, capitaine.

40:27.960 --> 40:30.190
Hey, no!

40:33.000 --> 40:36.549
Hey! You can't eat it,
it's poisonous!

40:44.960 --> 40:46.712
What's he saying?

40:46.880 --> 40:49.997
He says we should follow him
to greener pastures!

40:50.800 --> 40:55.555
- What?
- He say, it's-a greener down there.

40:55.720 --> 40:58.996
- Green? Down where?
- I don't know.

40:59.160 --> 41:01.628
To greener pastures.

41:01.800 --> 41:03.631
Slow down!

41:04.760 --> 41:08.673
The birds in his belly
crave greener pastures!

41:09.440 --> 41:13.558
Hey! It is a-greener down there.

41:13.720 --> 41:15.790
Greener pastures.

41:17.400 --> 41:21.996
Slow down.

41:28.920 --> 41:30.717
Please don't run!

41:30.880 --> 41:33.314
The poison works faster if you run!

41:40.000 --> 41:41.877
Slow down.

41:51.800 --> 41:53.153
It's poisonous.

42:01.560 --> 42:04.836
What?

42:58.320 --> 43:02.233
He's giving us directions.

43:23.960 --> 43:26.872
- Go! Go!
- Go! Go! Go! Go!

43:31.040 --> 43:34.077
Go! - G 0, go, go, go, go

44:25.880 --> 44:30.271
Slaves!

44:39.920 --> 44:45.870
Odious' flag!

44:47.720 --> 44:49.278
We must free the slaves.

44:51.280 --> 44:52.713
- Hi-yah!
- Ha!

45:03.800 --> 45:07.759
Yah! Tell me, Alexandria,
do you read english?

45:07.920 --> 45:12.914
You always stop at the same part
when it's very beautiful...

45:13.800 --> 45:15.358
And interesting.

45:15.560 --> 45:17.915
I just wanted to know
if you can read english.

45:18.800 --> 45:20.438
Can you?

45:21.240 --> 45:23.629
- Can you read english?
- Yeah.

45:23.800 --> 45:25.518
What's this?

45:25.680 --> 45:27.398
- Paper.
- No.

45:28.600 --> 45:33.435
- What's this?
- M-o-r-p-h...

45:35.120 --> 45:37.918
- Three.
- What's that?

45:38.080 --> 45:40.275
- Three.
- That's good.

45:43.360 --> 45:46.875
I'm having a hard time sleeping,
and I can't remember that story.

45:50.200 --> 45:52.350
I need some pills.

45:52.560 --> 45:56.633
I need pills in a... in a bottle
that has this written on them.

45:56.800 --> 46:00.076
M-0o-r-b-h-i-n-three?

46:00.240 --> 46:03.073
Yes. And it's in the main block.

46:06.160 --> 46:08.549
In that room in the main block.

46:12.400 --> 46:15.836
- You understand?
- Ask the head nurse.

46:16.000 --> 46:17.877
I'm asking you as a friend.

46:18.040 --> 46:20.998
- But it's stealing.
- No, it's not. Not if you need it.

46:23.160 --> 46:26.277
It's no different than stealing
bread from a church.

46:28.960 --> 46:31.520
- I'll ask them for you.
- No.

46:33.040 --> 46:35.110
It's a bandit secret.

46:36.760 --> 46:39.115
I need the pills to finish the story.

46:39.280 --> 46:41.077
You understand?

46:41.240 --> 46:43.879
- I can't get it...
- I'll do it.

46:44.600 --> 46:46.158
Thanks.

46:57.560 --> 46:59.198
You look beautiful.

47:02.000 --> 47:05.072
Why do you put red on your cheeks?

47:05.440 --> 47:08.238
Because it makes you look...

47:10.120 --> 47:11.792
Pretty...

47:15.360 --> 47:17.715
And healthy, too.

47:21.280 --> 47:23.794
- Back before lunch.
- I know!

47:23.960 --> 47:26.076
Alexandria, no licking the ice today?

47:26.240 --> 47:29.038
No. Thank you. Bye!

47:40.840 --> 47:44.071
One bite maybe.
But a pit of snakes?

48:31.080 --> 48:37.519
M-0o-r-p-h-i-n-three.

48:41.960 --> 48:45.919
M-0o-r-p-h-i-n-three.

48:54.080 --> 48:57.038
R-p-h-i-n-three.

49:10.040 --> 49:14.192
Maybe you got...

49:14.360 --> 49:18.672
It's important you listen to me.
Think of your other children.

49:18.840 --> 49:20.796
I'm so sorry.

49:20.960 --> 49:24.714
Warn your children about rattlesnakes.

49:24.880 --> 49:30.159
This isn't a good time. There are
snake pits all over this area.

49:36.400 --> 49:39.995
Wake up! Wake up! You better get up
or they'll chop you.

49:40.160 --> 49:44.312
You get up! You better get up
and show these people you are sleeping!

49:44.520 --> 49:48.115
These men will chop you
if you don't get up. Get up!

49:48.280 --> 49:51.158
Get up. This isn't funny.

49:51.320 --> 49:53.629
Please, let's leave this place.

50:06.920 --> 50:08.990
Come on! Come on!

50:15.720 --> 50:17.836
I do that all the time.

50:18.000 --> 50:20.673
All you have to do
is change your clothes

50:20.840 --> 50:23.195
and hide the wet ones until they're dry.

50:26.320 --> 50:28.834
You know what I do
when something frightens me?

50:29.800 --> 50:31.358
I say the magic words.

50:33.920 --> 50:38.198
Googly, googly, googly, begone.

50:41.920 --> 50:44.434
Let's practise together.

50:44.640 --> 50:46.198
The magic words.

50:47.400 --> 50:50.437
Googly, googly, googly. Go away.

50:57.600 --> 51:01.149
- Did you get what I sent you for?
- Yes.

51:02.680 --> 51:04.591
- This it is.
- Yeah?

51:06.920 --> 51:10.037
- There's only three.
- You asked me for three.

51:10.200 --> 51:13.272
- No, I asked you for a full bottle.
- But you wrote three.

51:13.440 --> 51:16.398
Was this bottle full of pills?

51:16.600 --> 51:18.670
- Were there more pills in here?
- Yeah.

51:18.840 --> 51:23.152
- What did you do with them?
- I throw them in the toilet.

51:24.200 --> 51:27.158
But I throw them away
because you wrote:

51:27.320 --> 51:33.190
M-o-r-p-h-i-n-three -

51:35.560 --> 51:37.710
will they help you sleep?

51:41.560 --> 51:43.551
A nap perhaps.

51:49.840 --> 51:53.355
- We must free the slaves.
- Did they free the slaves?

52:45.360 --> 52:46.634
Aah!

53:10.920 --> 53:12.638
Come out, odious.

53:35.800 --> 53:37.791
Just like a butterfly.

53:43.880 --> 53:45.950
Why the mask again?

53:46.560 --> 53:49.358
He doesn't want to scare her.

53:49.560 --> 53:51.790
She doesn't know anything about him,

53:51.960 --> 53:54.872
but he knew everything about her.

53:56.880 --> 53:59.713
The colour of her eyes.

54:01.440 --> 54:02.839
Brown.

54:03.000 --> 54:05.560
Her favourite food.

54:05.720 --> 54:07.358
Orange?

54:07.560 --> 54:09.152
Her favourite book.

54:09.320 --> 54:11.436
Bible.

54:11.640 --> 54:15.030
Boys, she's mine.

54:18.360 --> 54:20.920
- What about the bomb?
- What?

54:21.080 --> 54:22.308
The bomb!

54:29.640 --> 54:31.039
Yah!

54:31.200 --> 54:33.760
The bandits
kidnapped the Princess,

54:33.920 --> 54:36.388
leaving behind her little nephew.

54:43.120 --> 54:47.033
They rode down from the high mountain
deserts to a place he loved.

54:51.200 --> 54:54.158
He had played, as a child,
with his twin.

54:56.240 --> 54:59.277
A palace in the middle of a lake.

55:39.840 --> 55:42.434
What's the matter with that poor fellow?

55:44.960 --> 55:47.030
Ever since the Indian's misfortune,

55:47.200 --> 55:49.919
he took a vow
to never look at another squaw.

55:50.080 --> 55:53.789
But a man cannot show what's
in his heart when he hides his face.

55:56.840 --> 55:58.796
Who, may I ask, are you?

55:59.160 --> 56:01.515
To most I am known as the masked bandit.

56:01.680 --> 56:04.592
The scourge of the southeast?

56:07.680 --> 56:09.432
That's the one.

56:14.360 --> 56:16.749
But that's only when I wear the mask.

56:24.960 --> 56:25.995
Who are you?

56:31.640 --> 56:34.108
Nurse Evelyn.

56:35.880 --> 56:38.872
Once I was lady Evelyn
Everest everhardt,

56:39.040 --> 56:41.759
and now I am simply called...

56:41.920 --> 56:43.990
- Sister Evelyn.
- She is not the sister.

56:44.160 --> 56:48.153
Bless you. No. What? Yes, she is.

56:48.320 --> 56:51.756
She doesn't have brothers and sisters.

56:51.920 --> 56:55.515
No, she's a nun,
like these nuns out here.

56:59.520 --> 57:01.909
She turned from the masked bandit
and she said:

57:02.080 --> 57:05.390
- May I be frank with you?
- Of course.

57:05.600 --> 57:09.195
Although I've dedicated my life
to god and goodness,

57:09.360 --> 57:13.353
I secretly love
throwing oranges at our priest.

57:13.560 --> 57:15.391
Two turns to the left to the bathroom.

57:15.600 --> 57:18.831
- No, you read my note.
- What are you talking about?

57:19.000 --> 57:21.594
- Go to the bathroom.
- No.

57:21.760 --> 57:24.069
How do you know about the priest
and the orange?

57:24.240 --> 57:27.073
Everybody knows you like
throwing oranges at the priest.

57:27.240 --> 57:31.438
The priest knows, but I didn't
find out from your gibberish message.

57:31.640 --> 57:32.993
It's not gibberish.

57:47.080 --> 57:50.117
Thank you.

57:52.520 --> 57:54.397
Doctor?

57:59.800 --> 58:03.270
She wants to ask you
how much days I have to stay here.

58:03.440 --> 58:06.398
Well, I want you to stay here
until you get better.

58:08.560 --> 58:12.189
Uh, her cast will
come off in a few days.

58:12.360 --> 58:16.717
But I'd like her to stay here
until she's completely recovered.

58:26.280 --> 58:30.671
She wants to say that we are staying too
much times, we have to leave the city.

58:30.840 --> 58:34.196
Well, you just tell her that you
shouldn't be working in the groves.

58:34.360 --> 58:39.354
At your age it's dangerous, you'll spend
the rest of your days picking fruit.

58:39.560 --> 58:42.028
And then she'll fall.
She surely will fall.

59:08.520 --> 59:10.158
Thank you.

59:11.360 --> 59:14.511
- What did she say?
- She says ok.

59:14.680 --> 59:16.557
- Really?
- Really.

59:16.720 --> 59:19.632
Alexandria, she asked me something,
didn't she?

59:19.800 --> 59:22.792
- No, that's how we speak.
- Oh.

59:22.960 --> 59:24.996
- You sure?
- Sure.

59:42.400 --> 59:44.994
Beautiful machine.

59:45.160 --> 59:48.038
Beautiful machine.

01:00:03.520 --> 01:00:07.798
Beautiful machina. Beautiful machina.

01:00:07.960 --> 01:00:12.511
Beautiful machina.

01:00:12.680 --> 01:00:14.875
Beautiful machina.

01:00:15.040 --> 01:00:18.510
It's a very generous offer,
if you look over here at the numbers,

01:00:18.680 --> 01:00:21.956
it's more money than, uh,
I actually make a year.

01:00:22.120 --> 01:00:25.749
- I want to add something to it.
- Don't start adding stuff.

01:00:25.920 --> 01:00:28.798
You know the studio's
got a building full of lawyers.

01:00:28.960 --> 01:00:34.956
Jumping, falling, crashing,
cowhands are getting all the glory.

01:00:36.600 --> 01:00:38.955
Who's idea was it anyway?

01:00:39.120 --> 01:00:41.839
Jumping onto a horse
from a train bridge?

01:00:45.280 --> 01:00:48.192
Add screening to the contract
and I'll sign it.

01:00:48.360 --> 01:00:50.669
What happens to the money if I die?

01:00:50.840 --> 01:00:55.516
Roy, get off this suicide thing.

01:00:57.040 --> 01:00:59.395
Let the doctors finish
what they've started.

01:01:01.560 --> 01:01:03.869
The problem is not his back.

01:01:05.200 --> 01:01:08.033
It's a broken heart.

01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:10.672
He needs to get over her.

01:01:10.840 --> 01:01:13.354
I mean, he's not the first guy
to lose a girl.

01:01:16.000 --> 01:01:17.752
Sorry.

01:01:18.720 --> 01:01:21.075
You are someone famous?

01:01:23.240 --> 01:01:26.994
- So they tell me.
- Hey, kid!

01:01:38.440 --> 01:01:40.795
I made this for you.

01:01:47.760 --> 01:01:49.318
Who's in the mask?

01:01:49.520 --> 01:01:52.956
You, in the wheelchair.

01:01:56.080 --> 01:01:57.752
It's beautiful.

01:01:59.880 --> 01:02:01.711
I'll keep it forever.

01:02:01.880 --> 01:02:04.519
I hope I never get better.

01:02:06.040 --> 01:02:07.189
Why?

01:02:07.360 --> 01:02:11.239
'Cause I want to stay here with,
with you.

01:02:19.680 --> 01:02:22.433
- Hey, this came for you today.
- Really?

01:02:24.680 --> 01:02:27.797
- Do you like chocolate?
- I like it.

01:02:31.280 --> 01:02:33.874
Do you want me to finish the story?

01:02:34.040 --> 01:02:35.792
Yes.

01:02:37.120 --> 01:02:40.590
- I need a favour.
- What kind of favour?

01:02:40.760 --> 01:02:42.273
You know our friend Walt?

01:02:42.440 --> 01:02:45.432
- He's not my friend.
- He's not my friend, either.

01:02:45.640 --> 01:02:48.677
I retrieved this key from him

01:02:48.840 --> 01:02:52.276
because I think he's been
stealing my pills.

01:02:52.440 --> 01:02:54.715
I think he's got them
in his cabinet there.

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.673
I want you to go check
and see if he's got them.

01:02:58.840 --> 01:03:02.355
Why? I got you the bottle.

01:03:02.560 --> 01:03:05.358
There weren't enough in there
for me to go to sleep.

01:03:10.280 --> 01:03:13.192
Come on, be a good bandit.

01:03:16.200 --> 01:03:18.395
I don't want to be a bandit.

01:03:20.160 --> 01:03:22.230
That's too bad.

01:03:23.080 --> 01:03:28.279
Because odious' castle
was surrounded by a big, blue city.

01:03:31.360 --> 01:03:36.275
And that's where the bandits are headed
for their final encounter.

01:03:39.640 --> 01:03:42.791
This is the best part of the story.
Since you're leaving soon,

01:03:42.960 --> 01:03:46.635
I'd hate for you to spend your
whole life wondering how it turned out.

01:03:50.840 --> 01:03:53.229
- What's in the drawer?
- Stuff.

01:03:53.400 --> 01:03:56.710
- What kind of stuff?
- Stuff Walt's been stealing from me.

01:03:58.360 --> 01:04:01.830
- What?
- I won't know until you go look.

01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:06.039
- Promise you'll finish the story?
- Yeah.

01:04:30.600 --> 01:04:32.272
It's that brown bottle.

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:37.310
- This one?
- That's the one.

01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.230
I think he stole it from me.

01:04:46.880 --> 01:04:48.233
That's mine.

01:04:50.600 --> 01:04:52.750
Where did we leave off?

01:04:52.920 --> 01:04:55.229
They were telling secrets.

01:04:55.400 --> 01:04:58.710
I'm looking for the man
who murdered my father.

01:04:58.880 --> 01:05:00.359
The black bandit said.

01:05:00.560 --> 01:05:03.950
- My brother, the blue masked bandit...
- He said,

01:05:04.120 --> 01:05:08.238
- tried to avenge our father's death.
- "I've been on a quest...

01:05:08.400 --> 01:05:09.992
For revenge."

01:05:10.160 --> 01:05:13.596
He told her everything about his life,

01:05:13.760 --> 01:05:16.672
except for the name of governor odious.

01:05:16.840 --> 01:05:18.910
You need to leave.

01:05:27.360 --> 01:05:29.316
You should go.

01:05:29.520 --> 01:05:33.035
But you promised
you'll tell me the story.

01:05:37.280 --> 01:05:39.589
You've captivated my heart.

01:05:41.920 --> 01:05:45.117
That's why I can no longer
keep you in captivity.

01:05:46.760 --> 01:05:48.671
I've fallen in love with you.

01:05:50.720 --> 01:05:52.836
But I am consumed with revenge.

01:05:55.840 --> 01:05:58.195
I'm not a man who can be loved.

01:05:59.440 --> 01:06:01.715
When I fall asleep, you gotta go.

01:06:05.280 --> 01:06:07.430
And don't come back tomorrow.

01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:10.991
Ok.

01:06:15.040 --> 01:06:16.712
Thank you.

01:06:23.440 --> 01:06:26.193
- I'm sorry about this.
- Why?

01:06:30.280 --> 01:06:32.157
I'm sorry.

01:06:34.440 --> 01:06:35.839
Why?

01:06:38.360 --> 01:06:40.555
I don't want you to see me like this.

01:06:45.840 --> 01:06:48.115
You think you took me captive...

01:06:48.280 --> 01:06:50.874
& you think you took me captive

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:57.073
- in fact, you are my saviour.
- J in fact, you are my saviour

01:07:00.600 --> 01:07:04.593
- I was like a bird in a golden cage.
- & I was like a bird in a golden cage

01:07:08.200 --> 01:07:10.350
by freeing me,
you've captured my heart.

01:07:10.560 --> 01:07:13.597
J by freeing me
you've captured my heart

01:07:21.240 --> 01:07:22.958
Make them kiss.

01:07:23.120 --> 01:07:25.554
No, I don't wanna make them kiss.

01:07:25.720 --> 01:07:28.393
Hmm... why?

01:07:29.280 --> 01:07:31.874
Because of what they're
about to find out.

01:07:36.280 --> 01:07:40.034
She should
have not come with us.

01:07:43.120 --> 01:07:46.271
- Why?
- It is too dangerous.

01:07:46.440 --> 01:07:51.275
If we are captured,
governor odious shall surely kill her.

01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:55.195
You mentioned odious?

01:07:56.680 --> 01:07:58.910
He is my sworn enemy.

01:07:59.080 --> 01:08:00.877
And my fiance.

01:08:28.800 --> 01:08:29.868
No.

01:08:33.240 --> 01:08:36.788
I want to look at you until I die.

01:08:38.960 --> 01:08:41.109
What a mystery this world.

01:08:42.040 --> 01:08:43.631
One day you love them...

01:08:44.560 --> 01:08:47.950
Then the next day you want to
kill them a thousand times over.

01:08:52.160 --> 01:08:53.877
God forgive him.

01:09:01.439 --> 01:09:04.591
I'm glad I never kissed you.

01:09:10.319 --> 01:09:14.073
She can't die.

01:09:16.359 --> 01:09:19.955
She's still alive.

01:09:25.080 --> 01:09:27.992
The solid gold locket
stopped the bullet.

01:09:36.880 --> 01:09:39.075
"My dearest daughter:

01:09:39.240 --> 01:09:41.834
Never marry for money,

01:09:42.560 --> 01:09:45.551
fame, power or security.

01:09:47.040 --> 01:09:50.270
Always follow your heart.

01:09:50.439 --> 01:09:52.192
Your ever loving father..."

01:09:52.359 --> 01:09:54.430
It says all that
on that little locket?

01:09:55.760 --> 01:09:56.954
Si.

01:09:58.320 --> 01:10:02.711
I've never been able to open it.
No one's been able to open it.

01:10:02.880 --> 01:10:04.518
You're the first.

01:10:08.080 --> 01:10:11.709
And he, and he knew she was the woman
he was supposed to love.

01:10:12.200 --> 01:10:16.352
Please, please? Now they can kiss-kiss?

01:10:17.120 --> 01:10:18.519
Yes.

01:10:21.200 --> 01:10:23.156
But first, marriage.

01:10:28.440 --> 01:10:30.192
And then they can kiss.

01:10:49.960 --> 01:10:51.109
The ring.

01:11:16.400 --> 01:11:19.119
The mystic spies danger in your palm.

01:11:19.280 --> 01:11:22.989
You've taken too many pills.
Death is near.

01:11:23.160 --> 01:11:25.879
Danger?

01:11:26.040 --> 01:11:30.636
Suicide is not the answer.

01:11:30.800 --> 01:11:33.712
He says he
also knows of a secret chant,

01:11:33.880 --> 01:11:35.711
whenever we're in trouble...

01:11:37.720 --> 01:11:41.952
Something about "googly-googly"?

01:11:42.120 --> 01:11:45.954
He says if you fall asleep,
you will never wake up.

01:12:11.920 --> 01:12:13.876
The mystic was right.

01:12:14.040 --> 01:12:16.679
The stony-faced priest
had betrayed them.

01:13:23.120 --> 01:13:26.430
- And then they were saved?
- No.

01:13:32.080 --> 01:13:34.833
There was no one left
to save them.

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:49.798
Wallace?

01:13:49.960 --> 01:13:53.350
Wallace, is that you? Wallace?

01:13:53.560 --> 01:13:56.120
- No. It's me.
- Huh?

01:13:59.760 --> 01:14:04.072
No wonder the bag was so heavy.

01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:22.514
- Ch-ch-ch.
- Shoot.

01:14:28.760 --> 01:14:31.274
Shoot, shoot! Shoot them, daddy!

01:14:33.120 --> 01:14:34.792
Shoot them!

01:14:39.800 --> 01:14:42.792
Daddy, don't you recognise me?

01:14:42.960 --> 01:14:44.678
Don't you? It's me!

01:14:46.800 --> 01:14:49.598
Don't you recognise me?

01:14:53.680 --> 01:14:56.433
- Who are you?
- It's me, da-da.

01:14:56.640 --> 01:14:58.437
- Who?
- Me!

01:14:58.640 --> 01:15:01.791
- My daughter?
- Yes, you recognise me.

01:15:03.080 --> 01:15:06.516
Yeah. My daughter
from a previous marriage.

01:15:06.680 --> 01:15:08.193
Yes.

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:13.309
I didn't recognise you
'cause you got teeth.

01:15:17.240 --> 01:15:20.789
You must be stronger now.

01:15:22.360 --> 01:15:24.794
Not the time to sleep now.

01:15:26.600 --> 01:15:29.034
Not the time to sleep.

01:15:33.080 --> 01:15:37.153
It's not time to sleep.

01:15:55.960 --> 01:15:57.598
Wake up.

01:16:06.240 --> 01:16:08.435
Wake up, it's not the time to sleep now.

01:16:12.400 --> 01:16:14.072
Wake up.

01:16:15.560 --> 01:16:17.039
Don't pretend to sleep.

01:16:18.360 --> 01:16:21.158
Wake up. Laugh, laugh.

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:28.878
Not the time to sleep.

01:17:05.880 --> 01:17:07.916
Hmm.

01:17:26.920 --> 01:17:31.869
Americana exotica.

01:17:36.600 --> 01:17:38.795
Does dr snider know about this?

01:17:47.880 --> 01:17:51.668
He's under observation,
I thought he was getting better.

01:17:51.840 --> 01:17:53.671
Hey!

01:17:53.840 --> 01:17:55.956
Alexandria, go inside.

01:17:56.120 --> 01:17:58.588
Go on! All right, carry on.

01:18:12.760 --> 01:18:15.832
Roy, where are they taking you?

01:18:18.960 --> 01:18:21.554
Roy, wake up.

01:18:22.960 --> 01:18:25.952
Roy, wake up, wake up.

01:18:26.120 --> 01:18:29.157
Wake up. They're going
to cut you up, Roy.

01:18:29.320 --> 01:18:30.719
Gonna chop you up. Wake up.

01:18:30.880 --> 01:18:32.757
Go on. Shoo.

01:18:32.920 --> 01:18:35.593
Wake up.

01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:40.355
Oh, no, no, no.
He was his usual self, you know,

01:18:40.560 --> 01:18:44.997
smiling away, playing with his teeth.
I just don't feel very well, doc.

01:18:45.160 --> 01:18:49.631
I don't know what the hell's
wrong with me. I cough and...

01:18:49.800 --> 01:18:52.872
Am I going delirious from medication?
I don't know what...

01:18:54.520 --> 01:18:56.909
Roy.

01:18:59.080 --> 01:19:03.551
Roy! Roy, I...

01:19:03.720 --> 01:19:05.790
I thought you were dead.

01:19:05.960 --> 01:19:09.635
Saw two men and
they were carrying the body away.

01:19:09.800 --> 01:19:13.793
And then I tried to
pinch your toe.

01:19:16.720 --> 01:19:19.553
I run after, and after that

01:19:19.720 --> 01:19:24.555
one of the doctors told me "shoo"
and I... I had to go away.

01:19:24.720 --> 01:19:28.793
I'm sorry. I promise but, but you...

01:19:32.400 --> 01:19:35.392
- Roy, I bring you more medicine...
- Sugar.

01:19:35.600 --> 01:19:39.275
- If you want. I promise...
- They're giving him sugar.

01:19:41.880 --> 01:19:44.189
Oh. Well, it's great you're awake.

01:19:45.400 --> 01:19:49.791
- I brought your x-rays. You wanna look?
- Doc, the man's dead and you...

01:19:49.960 --> 01:19:51.837
Roy!

01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:53.877
Will you shut up already?!

01:19:54.040 --> 01:19:57.715
Get out of here! You're not really sick,
Walt! They're feeding you sugar!

01:19:57.880 --> 01:19:59.359
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

01:19:59.560 --> 01:20:01.312
Nurse! Nurse!

01:20:01.520 --> 01:20:03.590
What do you mean
they're giving me sugar?

01:20:03.760 --> 01:20:05.990
She's wet herself.
Get her out of here.

01:20:06.160 --> 01:20:08.674
Come.

01:20:08.840 --> 01:20:12.435
Go back to your room. Orderlies!

01:21:06.680 --> 01:21:08.671
You should be in bed, Alexandria.

01:21:08.840 --> 01:21:11.229
There's more fires in the field.

01:21:14.840 --> 01:21:16.432
It's kerosene.

01:21:16.640 --> 01:21:19.029
The kerosene stops the fruit
from freezing.

01:21:19.200 --> 01:21:22.795
No, it's mystic.

01:21:22.960 --> 01:21:25.952
He's coming out of the tree to help Roy.

01:21:27.680 --> 01:21:31.593
I think it's bedtime, young lady.
No more time for funny talk.

01:21:32.680 --> 01:21:34.113
Into bed now.

01:21:35.400 --> 01:21:38.119
And, maybe, one day,
you can take me downstairs

01:21:38.280 --> 01:21:41.352
and introduce me to your friend, Roy.

01:21:41.560 --> 01:21:44.438
May I go downstairs and say good night?

01:21:44.640 --> 01:21:47.871
No. He's not allowed any visitors.

01:21:48.040 --> 01:21:50.429
Your friend Roy needs to rest.

01:21:50.640 --> 01:21:53.996
He's very sad. He's lost his girlfriend.

01:21:54.160 --> 01:21:55.388
He needs to sleep.

01:21:55.600 --> 01:21:58.433
But he can't.
He needs medicine to sleep.

01:21:58.640 --> 01:22:01.279
And he doesn't have any,
that's the problem.

01:22:01.440 --> 01:22:04.750
I'm sure they're taking
very good care of him.

01:22:05.960 --> 01:22:07.837
Now it's time for bed.

01:22:09.120 --> 01:22:11.350
Little girls need to go to sleep, too.

01:22:11.560 --> 01:22:14.791
- I'm not little. I am five.
- Of course.

01:22:15.560 --> 01:22:17.232
I forgot.

01:23:15.080 --> 01:23:18.072
Googly, googly.

01:23:18.240 --> 01:23:20.800
Googly, googly, googly, googly.

01:23:20.960 --> 01:23:25.192
Googly, googly, googly,
googly, googly, googly, googly.

01:23:30.080 --> 01:23:33.356
Googly, googly, go away. Googly, googly.

01:23:36.680 --> 01:23:40.992
Googly, googly, go away.

01:23:44.800 --> 01:23:46.836
Googly, googly, go away.

01:23:51.440 --> 01:23:55.513
Googly, googly... go away.

01:23:55.680 --> 01:23:59.912
Googly, googly, googly,
googly, googly, go away.

01:24:23.640 --> 01:24:28.111
Papa. They steal our horse.

01:24:30.800 --> 01:24:35.430
Papa. They steal our horse.

01:24:36.160 --> 01:24:37.752
Papa.

01:24:41.080 --> 01:24:42.399
They steal our horse.

01:24:42.600 --> 01:24:47.230
Papa, the angry people burn our home.

01:24:47.640 --> 01:24:49.358
They burn our home!

01:24:49.560 --> 01:24:51.152
Don't go outside.

01:24:51.320 --> 01:24:52.639
Thieves.

01:24:52.800 --> 01:24:55.189
Angry people kill you.

01:24:56.320 --> 01:24:59.517
Thieves! Hey, my horse!

01:25:29.640 --> 01:25:31.312
The X-ray seems fine.

01:25:39.600 --> 01:25:40.919
Mommy!

01:25:49.760 --> 01:25:51.159
Mommy!

01:25:51.320 --> 01:25:53.629
Were you taking medicine to Roy?

01:25:53.800 --> 01:25:55.074
No, mama.

01:25:55.240 --> 01:25:58.994
That is your responsibility,
and this is how you treat it!

01:25:59.160 --> 01:26:02.118
To get better,
you gotta have the will...

01:26:02.280 --> 01:26:05.909
And your own desire... to live.

01:26:44.080 --> 01:26:46.150
I fell again.

01:26:46.320 --> 01:26:49.710
I heard. Everybody's heard.

01:26:51.280 --> 01:26:52.872
You're famous.

01:26:55.600 --> 01:26:59.673
Are... are they angry?

01:26:59.840 --> 01:27:01.592
Yeah.

01:27:03.520 --> 01:27:04.589
But not at you.

01:27:04.760 --> 01:27:07.638
I tried to take more pills,
but I fell,

01:27:07.800 --> 01:27:10.155
- it was the wrong thing, and...
- What?

01:27:10.320 --> 01:27:13.039
I put my foot on it when I went up...

01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:19.597
And later on the thing
made me go like that.

01:27:19.760 --> 01:27:20.909
And I fell.

01:27:27.280 --> 01:27:31.910
I... I didn't
tell anybody about our secret.

01:27:33.760 --> 01:27:37.389
Even when they tortured me with needles.

01:27:39.640 --> 01:27:42.029
Is that a pirate's flag?

01:27:42.200 --> 01:27:45.317
- Uh-huh. Un-uh.
- Is that yes or no?

01:27:47.160 --> 01:27:48.593
Tell me the story.

01:27:49.560 --> 01:27:51.835
I should go, you need your rest.

01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:53.194
But I want you to.

01:27:53.360 --> 01:27:55.271
- I know you do.
- You promised.

01:27:57.200 --> 01:28:00.317
This story was just a trick
to get you to do something for me.

01:28:00.520 --> 01:28:02.954
- What?
- I was...

01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:07.549
- 1...
- But I need the story.

01:28:08.960 --> 01:28:11.235
You should ask someone else.

01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:15.753
There's no...
There's no happy ending with me.

01:28:18.520 --> 01:28:21.671
I still want to know.

01:28:21.840 --> 01:28:24.638
Ask your friend, nurse Evelyn,
she'll tell it better.

01:28:24.800 --> 01:28:28.110
- I don't want her in the story.
- Oh, she's ok.

01:28:28.280 --> 01:28:29.633
- Uh-uh.
- Mmm.

01:28:29.800 --> 01:28:33.349
Well, she doesn't really love
governor odious.

01:28:33.560 --> 01:28:36.950
She's just... she's just pretending.

01:28:37.600 --> 01:28:40.592
I saw her with one of the hospital men.

01:28:40.760 --> 01:28:43.433
She was just pretending to love you.

01:28:48.200 --> 01:28:52.034
- Just like your girlfriend.
- I see.

01:28:56.160 --> 01:28:59.869
Governor odious
with nurse Evelyn.

01:29:03.080 --> 01:29:04.798
She's right.

01:29:18.120 --> 01:29:19.997
She's right.

01:29:29.720 --> 01:29:34.032
We don't need her.
She can't be trusted.

01:29:35.880 --> 01:29:37.313
You give them your heart...

01:29:38.640 --> 01:29:41.200
But all they really want
is your wallet.

01:29:41.720 --> 01:29:45.269
Sooner or later she's gonna leave him
for a richer man.

01:29:46.120 --> 01:29:48.554
- It's a trap.
- I understand.

01:29:48.720 --> 01:29:52.998
- I don't like it.
- Thank you for telling me.

01:29:55.000 --> 01:29:58.151
This is suicide for all of us.

01:30:00.120 --> 01:30:01.872
We're going.

01:30:06.240 --> 01:30:10.233
Hey, Indian, what means "suicide"?

01:31:05.080 --> 01:31:07.230
Wallace? Wallace!

01:31:12.400 --> 01:31:16.075
Wallace! Wallace, what are you doing?

01:31:16.840 --> 01:31:19.513
Wallace, please, will you come down?

01:31:21.400 --> 01:31:23.709
Please? This really isn't the time.

01:31:23.880 --> 01:31:26.952
Wallace, please?
Wallace, will you come down?

01:31:29.200 --> 01:31:30.269
Wallace!

01:31:37.040 --> 01:31:39.349
Wallace?

01:31:39.560 --> 01:31:41.516
Wallace?

01:31:43.080 --> 01:31:44.559
Wallace, what did you do?

01:31:44.720 --> 01:31:46.836
Oh, Wallace.

01:31:50.360 --> 01:31:51.998
Wallace?

01:31:54.160 --> 01:31:56.549
Americana exotica.

01:31:58.720 --> 01:32:01.439
Americana exotica.

01:32:02.280 --> 01:32:04.316
It's beautiful.

01:32:14.280 --> 01:32:17.795
- Does he really...
- Died?

01:32:28.880 --> 01:32:30.632
Let's go!

01:32:31.080 --> 01:32:32.718
I'm all washed up.

01:32:32.880 --> 01:32:35.155
- Uncle Darwin!
- Don't leave me, my friend.

01:32:35.320 --> 01:32:38.835
- There's angry people!
- I'll tell everyone they're your idea.

01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:42.992
They're going to find out I'm a fraud.

01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:48.195
Go on! Shoot, you animals.

01:32:51.320 --> 01:32:53.436
They'll pay you well for Darwin's hide.

01:33:06.840 --> 01:33:08.751
He died, too.

01:33:10.080 --> 01:33:12.833
And Wallace, too?

01:33:13.000 --> 01:33:16.037
- Did he really died?
- Yeah.

01:33:16.200 --> 01:33:18.668
And in Wallace's case, happily so.

01:33:20.440 --> 01:33:22.556
It was the natural order of things.

01:33:32.800 --> 01:33:34.518
All things must die.

01:33:42.200 --> 01:33:43.713
Ah!

01:33:45.960 --> 01:33:48.235
Oh! Damn it all.

01:34:13.040 --> 01:34:16.271
Back! Get back!

01:34:57.400 --> 01:34:59.311
Kaboom.

01:35:33.560 --> 01:35:35.630
If you want something done...

01:35:35.800 --> 01:35:37.313
Get down there!

01:35:37.520 --> 01:35:39.317
You have to do it yourself.

01:35:39.520 --> 01:35:41.351
Get down there, you animals!

01:35:41.560 --> 01:35:43.198
And bring them up here!

01:35:50.560 --> 01:35:55.156
I don't like this!
I don't like this story!

01:35:55.320 --> 01:35:58.835
Why are we running away?

01:36:09.560 --> 01:36:12.711
Why did Luigi kill himself?

01:36:12.880 --> 01:36:15.713
Why did he not come with us?

01:36:15.880 --> 01:36:17.916
He was half a man.

01:36:20.320 --> 01:36:24.233
He couldn't do that. He gave up.

01:36:24.400 --> 01:36:27.073
It's not very satisfying, is it?

01:36:27.240 --> 01:36:29.435
He didn't think so, either.

01:36:40.360 --> 01:36:44.911
Please, the mystic.
Why, why are they killing the mystic?

01:36:46.920 --> 01:36:49.275
We need to go help him!

01:36:53.840 --> 01:36:56.400
Mystic!

01:36:56.600 --> 01:36:58.750
- Hey!
- Mystic!

01:37:01.600 --> 01:37:04.876
Googly, googly, googly.

01:37:05.040 --> 01:37:06.189
Ahh!

01:37:08.520 --> 01:37:11.318
Googly, googly, googly.

01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:24.232
Googly, googly, googly!

01:37:43.560 --> 01:37:46.313
I'm sorry!

01:37:53.280 --> 01:37:56.511
I'm sorry!

01:38:00.160 --> 01:38:03.311
I'm sorry.

01:38:04.760 --> 01:38:07.991
Googly, googly, googly!

01:38:10.840 --> 01:38:13.912
I'm sorry.

01:38:15.520 --> 01:38:17.112
It's ok.

01:39:09.960 --> 01:39:11.678
Indian!

01:39:18.520 --> 01:39:20.636
- Up!
- Help!

01:39:28.400 --> 01:39:31.312
Oh!

01:39:36.720 --> 01:39:39.678
No, no, no, no!

01:39:39.840 --> 01:39:41.273
No, no, no, no!

01:39:48.560 --> 01:39:51.120
Why are you killing everybody?

01:39:53.960 --> 01:39:55.951
Why are you making everybody die?

01:39:56.120 --> 01:39:59.829
- It's my story.
- Mine, too!

01:40:03.240 --> 01:40:05.231
Bring them up here.

01:40:07.560 --> 01:40:08.709
Alive!

01:40:09.680 --> 01:40:11.352
We are here.

01:40:12.280 --> 01:40:15.955
Alive!

01:40:19.360 --> 01:40:23.990
- Roy!
- Don't look at her.

01:40:24.160 --> 01:40:27.835
- She is also with odious.
- Quiet.

01:40:30.120 --> 01:40:32.429
Just like your girlfriend!

01:40:32.640 --> 01:40:35.359
- Shut up!
- No!

01:40:35.560 --> 01:40:38.870
Your girlfriend
came with odious to see you.

01:40:39.040 --> 01:40:41.156
The bandit entered odious' garden.

01:40:41.320 --> 01:40:44.710
But she stood in the car, and...

01:40:44.880 --> 01:40:49.032
- Odious was nowhere to be seen.
- She and odious...

01:40:49.200 --> 01:40:53.830
The bandit ran past odious' hiding
place, odious cracked him in the nose!

01:40:57.760 --> 01:41:01.548
No! But wait a little.
Wait, please.

01:41:08.520 --> 01:41:11.671
So he sank
to the bottom of the pool.

01:41:12.960 --> 01:41:15.315
He didn't even try to swim.

01:41:15.520 --> 01:41:19.718
- You're making this up.
- No I'm not.

01:41:20.920 --> 01:41:22.592
He started to sink, he was dying.

01:41:24.320 --> 01:41:27.073
Let him live.

01:41:27.240 --> 01:41:30.437
Get up! Roy, get up and fight!

01:41:30.640 --> 01:41:34.394
Get up! Get up!

01:41:34.600 --> 01:41:36.795
- I'm afraid.
- Oh, what a shame.

01:41:36.960 --> 01:41:40.032
Goddamn it, get up!

01:41:41.880 --> 01:41:43.074
Look!

01:41:43.240 --> 01:41:45.879
- Look at him!
- Get up!

01:41:46.040 --> 01:41:48.270
- See how pathetic he is.
- I can't get up!

01:41:48.440 --> 01:41:50.317
- Get up, daddy!
- I can't!

01:41:50.520 --> 01:41:53.830
- The water's only waist high.
- I'm not your father.

01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:57.595
How pathetic, look at him.
He's a drug addict.

01:41:57.760 --> 01:42:00.115
Your father is a coward.

01:42:00.280 --> 01:42:03.716
- A useless, good-for-nothing.
- Dad, get up!

01:42:03.880 --> 01:42:08.317
He can't win. That's because
our masked bandit is a coward.

01:42:08.520 --> 01:42:12.354
Yeah, he never took an oath.

01:42:12.560 --> 01:42:15.518
- A fake, a liar and a coward.
- You're lying!

01:42:15.680 --> 01:42:21.118
Nuh-uh. He had his
fingers crossed. He has to die.

01:42:21.960 --> 01:42:23.757
I don't believe you.

01:42:26.560 --> 01:42:28.596
He was dying.

01:42:29.760 --> 01:42:31.990
Don't kill him.

01:42:32.160 --> 01:42:34.037
I'll bring you more pills if you want.

01:42:34.200 --> 01:42:35.315
Dad, get up!

01:42:35.520 --> 01:42:37.078
Don't kill him.

01:42:37.240 --> 01:42:39.708
- There's nothing left for him.
- His daughter.

01:42:39.880 --> 01:42:41.632
He wasn't her father, either.

01:42:42.920 --> 01:42:44.797
She loves him.

01:42:45.960 --> 01:42:49.396
She'll survive. She's young.

01:42:49.600 --> 01:42:51.830
I don't want you to die.

01:43:02.200 --> 01:43:04.156
Don't kill him.

01:43:13.840 --> 01:43:15.717
Let him live.

01:43:19.120 --> 01:43:20.951
Let him live.

01:43:21.400 --> 01:43:25.234
Don't kill him.

01:43:33.520 --> 01:43:35.636
Prom... promise?

01:43:35.800 --> 01:43:38.394
And don't cross you fingers.

01:43:38.600 --> 01:43:42.513
- I promise.
- Show me your hands.

01:43:47.000 --> 01:43:50.709
See?

01:43:54.600 --> 01:43:57.239
No more fighting.

01:43:58.560 --> 01:44:02.519
He needs to go to his daughter.
She's afraid.

01:44:02.680 --> 01:44:05.513
It's ok, it's all right.
It's over now.

01:44:08.400 --> 01:44:10.072
Give me a kiss.

01:44:12.120 --> 01:44:13.712
Ah.

01:44:29.000 --> 01:44:30.718
Roy...

01:44:31.840 --> 01:44:35.833
You do realise it was all a test
to see if you truly loved me, don't you?

01:44:48.360 --> 01:44:50.555
We're finally free to follow our hearts.

01:44:50.720 --> 01:44:52.312
Huh.

01:44:58.440 --> 01:45:00.635
By all means...

01:45:04.200 --> 01:45:05.758
Follow your heart.

01:45:08.680 --> 01:45:09.749
Hmm.

01:45:12.240 --> 01:45:14.310
I'm not feeling very well.

01:45:28.360 --> 01:45:30.590
We're a strange pair, aren't we?

01:45:30.760 --> 01:45:31.909
Mm-hmm.

01:45:43.240 --> 01:45:45.310
What's that guy doing on the track?

01:45:45.520 --> 01:45:48.193
Action, action, action, action.

01:46:50.720 --> 01:46:53.109
This is the trash
we're making now?

01:46:53.280 --> 01:46:57.956
People jumping off buildings,
Bridges, horses.

01:47:30.560 --> 01:47:32.630
Did I just miss something?

01:47:35.280 --> 01:47:38.636
That was it? That was his big stunt?

01:47:39.640 --> 01:47:41.631
He didn't even use that horse thing.

01:48:30.560 --> 01:48:33.996
I put old man teeth there

01:48:34.160 --> 01:48:36.833
because I think that, uh,

01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:39.309
mystic comes out of the tree

01:48:39.520 --> 01:48:41.909
and it will grow a special orange tree

01:48:42.080 --> 01:48:45.072
Alexandria! Alexandria!

01:48:48.920 --> 01:48:52.230
And we'll have oranges
inside with teeths...

01:48:52.400 --> 01:48:54.436
With teeth inside.

01:49:09.440 --> 01:49:13.877
When I get out from the hospital,
I miss Roy very much.

01:49:14.040 --> 01:49:15.553
Americana! Americana!

01:49:15.720 --> 01:49:19.269
My mother told me that
he played in pictures,

01:49:19.440 --> 01:49:24.958
and he does things that other actors
cannot do, like falling and hitting,

01:49:25.120 --> 01:49:27.270
and...

01:49:28.320 --> 01:49:32.359
When they climb on something,
when they...

01:49:33.720 --> 01:49:38.271
I didn't believe my mother,
but then I saw him.

01:49:46.680 --> 01:49:51.879
I watch the picture
again and again and again and...

01:49:52.040 --> 01:49:55.635
To make sure that was Roy,
and was Roy!

01:49:59.240 --> 01:50:03.791
And then, I like the action
from all the pictures because

01:50:03.960 --> 01:50:07.396
I know that Roy is making
all the falling and hitting

01:50:07.600 --> 01:50:10.956
and climbing, and he was on a stair

01:50:11.120 --> 01:50:14.396
and he was going up and down
and up and down.

01:50:15.240 --> 01:50:18.152
And he was falling from the train,

01:50:18.320 --> 01:50:22.598
and he was taking the car,
and he was falling from...

01:50:54.440 --> 01:50:57.637
He was falling from the bicycle
and a house. It was Wallace!

01:50:57.800 --> 01:50:59.233
He was falling with a rope.

01:50:59.400 --> 01:51:03.552
And he was hit and he was going,
"mwah! Mwah! Mwah!

01:51:03.720 --> 01:51:08.111
Thank you! Thank you!
Thank you very much"!
