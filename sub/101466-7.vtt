FRASER: What is this place,
why'd you bring me here?

00:08.279 --> 00:11.405
(SIGHS) Why not?
It's beautiful.

00:11.822 --> 00:13.530
I mean, it's kind of unusual
for a first date--

00:13.613 --> 00:15.405
I mean for a first whatever.

00:15.488 --> 00:16.738
First whatever.

00:21.738 --> 00:22.863

00:22.947 --> 00:24.863
<i>with a guy who's also</i>
<i>in your chain of command.</i>

00:25.238 --> 00:27.071
SARAH: Just didn't
occur to me to tell you.

00:27.488 --> 00:29.446
Plus you haven't been
around the house much.

00:29.697 --> 00:31.113
SERGEANT: <i>A-ten-hut!</i>

00:31.863 --> 00:34.113
Present-hut!

00:34.196 --> 00:35.905
SARAH: <i>You still want</i>
<i>to be a soldier?</i>

00:36.530 --> 00:37.446
Uh, maybe.

00:37.780 --> 00:39.863
SARAH: <i>And did your father know</i>
<i>when you say "soldier,"</i>

00:39.947 --> 00:41.279
you mean "male soldier?"

00:42.738 --> 00:44.822
To this day
we're spending together.

00:44.905 --> 00:46.780
Woo! There she is!

00:47.363 --> 00:50.905
-Hi. Nice to meet you.
-Fraser, meet my friend, Martha.

00:52.113 --> 00:54.446
(PHONE VIBRATES)

00:54.530 --> 00:55.446
Yes?

(overlapping chatter continues)

02:06.029 --> 02:08.279
Woman 1:
Ma'am, it was
a powerful explosion

02:08.363 --> 02:09.655
caused by an IED.

02:09.738 --> 02:12.738
-It's still under investigation.
-Woman 2: We need the flags now.

Helicopter with the soldiers

02:21.196 --> 02:22.947
who survived the blast
is headed for Herat.

02:23.029 --> 02:26.071
-None of them are
seriously injured.
-Man: Position of the convoy!

02:26.154 --> 02:27.947
-Ex O.
-Bowman: I'm still waiting
on a reply, sir.

02:28.029 --> 02:30.530
(chatter continues)

02:55.405 --> 02:58.279
Jonathan.
What happened?

02:58.363 --> 03:01.738
I apologize for waking you
but I need Sarah's uniform.

03:07.113 --> 03:09.363
Come in.
I'll get it right away.

everybody running?
-Boy 2: I don't know.

Thought you're not
supposed to run.

05:37.071 --> 05:39.822
Jonathan's just ridiculous
here, isn't he?

05:39.905 --> 05:42.405
You know, it made me
laugh the first time
you showed it to me,

05:42.488 --> 05:44.822
but not that much.

05:44.905 --> 05:47.405
Yeah, he's not
at his best here.

-Teacher: Yes, but it
still looks unfinished.
-My god, I've been making

05:56.029 --> 05:58.405
these fucking centerpieces
for 10 years.

05:58.488 --> 06:00.446
Ten years of
sheer ugliness.

06:00.530 --> 06:02.279
It's Thanksgiving.

06:02.363 --> 06:04.321
"My thanksgiving
is perpetual."

-The fuck is that
supposed to mean?
-It's Thoreau!

06:06.488 --> 06:08.113
And you would know that
if you studied more,

06:08.196 --> 06:10.405
and you weren't
hunting birds in the swamps.

06:11.321 --> 06:13.071
You could do a better job.

06:13.154 --> 06:15.863
Caitlin:
You know, later I'm gonna
see Dr. Harris with your mom.

06:15.947 --> 06:18.154
Girl:
My felt ran out of ink.

06:19.446 --> 06:22.613

06:23.571 --> 06:25.863
-You sure you still wanna go?
-Mm-hmm.

06:25.947 --> 06:27.697
What if your
father finds out?

06:27.780 --> 06:30.071
He grounded you for
a month over a haircut.

06:30.154 --> 06:32.363
My dad won't find out.

06:32.446 --> 06:34.905
Well, you'll get
a weird voice.

06:34.988 --> 06:38.321
-(deep voice): Hey, Dad,
lemme borrow your shaving cream.
-(laughs)

06:39.655 --> 06:42.530
Your mom said it's just
a medical consultation.

06:42.613 --> 06:44.363
Yeah, but my mom has
nothing to do with us.

06:44.446 --> 06:47.655
Only we have anything
to do with us.

06:47.738 --> 06:50.613
-And the hormones
will give you cancer.
-Man: Good morning, ma'am.

-What a pain.
-What? What is it?

07:01.029 --> 07:03.947
-It's Sam. He's been
calling me all morning.
-(giggles)

07:04.029 --> 07:06.488
-That boy is so tenacious.
-(murmuring)

07:06.571 --> 07:09.113
Kinda feel sorry for him.

07:09.196 --> 07:12.488
-Female Soldier: We have to stay
strong in front of the kids.
-Okay.

07:12.571 --> 07:13.947
You can do it.

07:14.029 --> 07:16.530
-Girl 1: What's going on?
-Teacher: Just a minute.

What do you think went wrong?

07:18.780 --> 07:22.029

-Girl 4: Did you
hear what they said?
-Girl 5: Not really.

07:33.113 --> 07:35.780
We have to go to the gym,
students.

07:35.863 --> 07:38.279

Gather round me.
Come on in and have a seat.

08:05.697 --> 08:09.071
Come on in, my friends.
Have a seat. Gather around me.

08:16.113 --> 08:18.488

we recently deployed

08:18.571 --> 08:20.905
a group of soldiers
to Afghanistan.

08:20.988 --> 08:24.279
And three of our soldiers
were killed last night.

08:25.738 --> 08:27.738
Among them...

08:27.822 --> 08:31.279
among them was the brother
of one of your classmates.

Listen. Class is canceled
for the rest of the day.

08:39.405 --> 08:41.488
You'll be separated into
groups to talk about

08:41.571 --> 08:43.571
your feelings with your teachers

08:43.655 --> 08:46.655
and with the grief counselors
who are here with me.

08:46.738 --> 08:49.988

you to join with me
