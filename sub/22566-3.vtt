19:28.835 --> 19:29.936
All right, bye.

19:41.881 --> 19:43.316
[ knock on door ]

19:59.599 --> 20:01.468
- You came.
- Here I am.

20:19.919 --> 20:21.521
Hi.

20:21.621 --> 20:22.755
Hi.

20:24.691 --> 20:27.260
- I'm glad you came.
- Me too.

20:31.464 --> 20:32.832
How was your trip?

20:32.932 --> 20:34.200
Fine.

20:34.301 --> 20:36.303
Uneventful.

20:36.403 --> 20:38.438
What time is the party?

20:38.538 --> 20:40.873
- The car will be here at seven.
- Great.

20:40.973 --> 20:42.141
I have time to take a shower.

20:42.241 --> 20:43.376
[ chuckles ]

21:00.827 --> 21:02.795
You know, we never
discussed payment.

21:04.731 --> 21:06.833
How much, and...

21:06.933 --> 21:08.868
...how you want me to pay you.

21:08.968 --> 21:10.903
That's not why I came.

21:11.003 --> 21:12.839
I'm here because I like you.

21:41.233 --> 21:43.436
I'm gonna jump in the shower.

21:45.137 --> 21:46.439
Okay.

21:53.513 --> 21:54.981
[ door closes ]

21:58.551 --> 22:01.588
[ indistinct chatter ]

22:02.989 --> 22:05.224
ANNA:
How are you
going to introduce me?

22:05.324 --> 22:07.794
ERICA:
As a friend.

22:07.894 --> 22:10.096
- Is that okay?
- Yes, that's fine.

22:10.196 --> 22:11.598
Just so I know.

22:13.633 --> 22:16.703
[ indistinct chatter ]

22:20.272 --> 22:21.808
There he is.

22:21.908 --> 22:25.612
The king of private equity
with his wife, Kathy.

22:25.712 --> 22:29.916
Apparently, his house staff are
only allowed to wear monochrome.

22:30.016 --> 22:32.952
He says that bright colors
make him lose focus.

22:33.052 --> 22:34.887
He sounds like a kind person.

22:37.690 --> 22:39.626
STEVEN:
I'd like to thank you all
for coming out to this

22:39.726 --> 22:42.629
small and intimate affair.

22:42.729 --> 22:45.031
Our sector has seen
tremendous growth

22:45.131 --> 22:46.899
over the past couple of years,
so much so that even

22:46.999 --> 22:49.235
the Fed agrees, penciling
in three rate hikes this year

22:49.335 --> 22:52.271
instead of two
under its prior forecast

22:52.371 --> 22:54.441
and targeting pre-2008 levels.

22:55.642 --> 22:58.745
Consumer confidence
is at a 17-year high.

22:58.845 --> 23:02.682
Financial conditions
are...ideal.

23:02.782 --> 23:04.551
And God forbid,
some may even be comfortable

23:04.651 --> 23:07.053
in their corner offices.

23:07.153 --> 23:08.621
But I would ask you

23:08.721 --> 23:11.458
to reconsider this sentiment.

23:11.558 --> 23:14.060
And then, I'd ask you
to file it away in a basement

23:14.160 --> 23:16.128
never to be seen again.

23:16.228 --> 23:17.697
We need to ensure

23:17.797 --> 23:21.834
that the regulatory rollback
continues.

23:21.934 --> 23:24.937
In 2010, Republicans
took control of the House

23:25.037 --> 23:28.174
which obstructed and shut down
the Democrats' legislative

23:28.274 --> 23:29.609
and anti-business agenda

23:29.709 --> 23:31.911
right through to the end
of Obama's presidency.

23:32.011 --> 23:35.682
And 2018 will prove
to be even more consequential.

23:35.782 --> 23:37.349
The entire House
of Representatives.

23:37.450 --> 23:38.718
A third of the senate

23:38.818 --> 23:41.053
and the majority
of governorships

23:41.153 --> 23:43.590
are in play.

23:45.024 --> 23:46.459
This is our chance

23:46.559 --> 23:48.861
to keep control
of the political system...

23:50.262 --> 23:52.164
...and protect our interests

23:52.264 --> 23:53.833
for decades to come.

24:01.173 --> 24:02.975
Initially, Becker fucked us.

24:03.075 --> 24:05.111
He opened up
the whole street for attack

24:05.211 --> 24:07.680
when he took Greycap public.

24:07.780 --> 24:10.416
Everyone already knew
his base salary was 350 a year

24:10.517 --> 24:11.918
but that gets out?

24:12.018 --> 24:14.453
Of course,
they're gonna come after us

24:14.554 --> 24:16.288
and try to shut us down.

24:16.388 --> 24:19.659
But now, no one gives a shit.

24:19.759 --> 24:22.361
Becker's still
taking in 350 million

24:22.461 --> 24:25.097
and we still have
carried interest.

24:25.197 --> 24:26.866
It's fantastic.

24:26.966 --> 24:28.334
And Becker's
still doubling down

24:28.434 --> 24:30.603
on his political advocacy.

24:30.703 --> 24:33.573
It's practically
financial paradise.

24:33.673 --> 24:36.743
McCord has no interest in
regulating the financial sector.

24:36.843 --> 24:39.011
He's always been against
the Volcker Rule

24:39.111 --> 24:42.582
and he wants to get rid
of Dodd-Frank in its entirety.

24:42.682 --> 24:45.251
- He's pro-business.
- Of course he is.

24:45.351 --> 24:47.186
He has to be.

24:47.286 --> 24:48.921
BECKER:
Who do you think would do a
better job spending your money?

24:49.021 --> 24:51.057
You or the government?
The person who earned it?

24:51.157 --> 24:52.725
Or some bloated bureaucracy?

24:52.825 --> 24:53.726
Exactly.

24:53.826 --> 24:55.728
The truth is, the public
will always be better off

24:55.828 --> 24:57.496
when the rich pay less tax,
'cause we do more good

24:57.597 --> 24:58.898
with our money
than any government can.

24:58.998 --> 25:00.700
We ought to be paid
by the government

25:00.800 --> 25:03.235
for all the employment
and wealth we're creating.

25:03.335 --> 25:06.338
I think you and McCord will have
similar thoughts on that.

25:06.438 --> 25:08.274
I think so too.

25:08.374 --> 25:10.309
What'd you think of my speech?

25:10.409 --> 25:12.111
It was heartwarming.

25:12.211 --> 25:14.513
I thought it was fitting.

25:14.614 --> 25:16.583
I'm looking forward
to our meeting tomorrow.

25:18.350 --> 25:19.886
I trust
you're having a good time.

25:19.986 --> 25:23.690
ANNA:
Wonderful. I can't tell you
how happy I am to be here.

25:23.790 --> 25:25.658
- Thank you for having me.
- It's my pleasure.

25:27.459 --> 25:29.295
- It's good to meet you.
- You too.

25:35.001 --> 25:36.903
How does it make you feel
to be looked up and down

25:37.003 --> 25:40.339
by some of this country's
most powerful people?

25:40.439 --> 25:44.010
I don't know.
How does it make you feel?

25:44.110 --> 25:46.012
Very, very important.

25:46.112 --> 25:47.747
Here. Come here.

25:50.917 --> 25:53.152
Oh, I can't keep
my hands off of you.
