WEBVTT

00:26.095 --> 00:27.786
Air is low
on fresh additives today.

00:40.316 --> 00:42.249
Of course, it's long
ceased to matter.

00:58.782 --> 01:00.060
The
universe is stupid.

01:03.063 --> 01:05.513
But the multiverse?

01:05.548 --> 01:08.965
No, not the infinitely
inter-connected universe

01:09.862 --> 01:11.381
of all universes.

01:12.969 --> 01:13.970
All knowing.

01:14.453 --> 01:15.454
Sentient.

01:16.904 --> 01:18.388
This was my boss.

01:19.838 --> 01:21.840
It gave me, gave those like me

01:22.910 --> 01:23.911
small jobs,

01:24.498 --> 01:25.533
minor adjustments.

01:27.673 --> 01:29.675
That's how it all began for me.

01:56.357 --> 01:58.325
Imagine you
playing for real

02:00.154 --> 02:02.881
in new worlds that you create,

02:02.915 --> 02:05.470
real as the world
you live in now.

02:05.504 --> 02:08.266
Only you'll actually be there.

02:20.347 --> 02:22.625
Enjoy an
unlimited variety

02:22.659 --> 02:24.937
of temporary but
actual mini-universes.

02:28.148 --> 02:30.184
Thanks to our unprecedented
breakthrough

02:30.219 --> 02:32.048
in the science of cosmic forces.

02:34.050 --> 02:36.535
This is InterMate,

02:36.570 --> 02:39.573
the very latest hyper
interactive reality game.

02:39.607 --> 02:41.678
In a guess who's
real game of chance.

02:49.341 --> 02:52.206
I'm Desa and I love this game.

02:52.241 --> 02:54.070
You will too.

02:54.104 --> 02:56.348
You can share your new
world with friends

02:57.625 --> 02:59.040
and amazing strangers.

03:02.941 --> 03:04.805
Before your
micro-universe collapses,

03:08.843 --> 03:12.295
you must find out who's
real and who's not.

03:16.610 --> 03:18.784
Is he real or is he not?

03:33.316 --> 03:34.317
Signal your choice.

03:41.635 --> 03:43.878
But don't get fooled
by the virtual players.

03:59.963 --> 04:02.794
Find the real players before
your micro-universe collapses

04:04.174 --> 04:07.316
and experience our
cosmo-neurological jackpot.

04:10.905 --> 04:11.906
Nice moves.

04:16.325 --> 04:17.326
Really nice moves.

04:20.570 --> 04:23.090
Choose your right players

04:23.124 --> 04:25.334
and your mutual focus ignites

04:25.368 --> 04:27.646
our incredible flashout climax.

04:48.357 --> 04:49.289
Ahhh!

04:52.119 --> 04:54.811
The perfect extreme of
ectasy can be yours.

Subscribe now to our blind
date alternate world game.

05:01.162 --> 05:04.373
Visit real worlds, not virtual.

05:04.407 --> 05:06.789
Experience actual baby universes

05:08.411 --> 05:09.309
for two,

05:09.895 --> 05:10.689
three,

05:11.552 --> 05:12.726
or four players.

05:14.210 --> 05:17.593
Step into cosmically
astonishing new realities

05:17.627 --> 05:18.973
with our exclusive white
hole science breakthrough,

05:20.354 --> 05:22.977
Intermate. Ready now through
all microtainment outlets

05:23.012 --> 05:24.358
within the habitat.

05:30.571 --> 05:32.539
I had been
assigned to this universe,

05:32.573 --> 05:34.057
assigned to shut down InterMate,

05:35.438 --> 05:37.198
to freeze it as is.

05:38.614 --> 05:40.409
Use a simple quantum block,
a small half measure.

05:41.858 --> 05:45.414
To merely suspend their
upstart mini realities?

05:46.035 --> 05:47.036
That's all?

05:48.106 --> 05:49.832
It was another weak work order.

05:50.867 --> 05:52.282
I had more than I
could remember,

05:52.593 --> 05:54.457
mundane, repetitive.

05:56.459 --> 05:59.635
Meanwhile, here, they
were actually decoding

05:59.669 --> 06:01.637
the hidden forces of
space-time itself.

06:03.604 --> 06:06.400
This time I had to
break the rules.

06:07.332 --> 06:09.714
I would improvise.

06:09.748 --> 06:12.337
Use my own advance strategies,

06:12.372 --> 06:14.684
my ideas for protecting
the multiverse.

06:16.859 --> 06:19.689
I would stop these
hackers from unraveling

06:19.724 --> 06:22.761
the actual fabric of reality.

06:22.796 --> 06:24.901
Stop them totally and for good.

06:36.050 --> 06:37.224
Dess

06:37.258 --> 06:38.259
♪♪ Yes, Taloor?

06:38.777 --> 06:39.778
Good news,

06:40.986 --> 06:42.885
I booked you for that
holocast dream song.

06:42.919 --> 06:43.920
Just a moment.

06:47.407 --> 06:49.029
Now is that the
sound of an agent

06:49.063 --> 06:51.445
who sometimes works for me?

06:51.480 --> 06:53.861
Please, I got you
InterMate, didn't I?

06:53.896 --> 06:55.449
Yeah, strange game.

06:56.450 --> 06:58.003
Why, what's strange?

06:58.038 --> 07:00.420
You play, you flashout,
and you're home again.

07:00.454 --> 07:02.422
I wanna work on things
I actually care about.

07:02.594 --> 07:04.596
Come on, Desa.

07:04.631 --> 07:06.149
You're the official
spokesperson for InterMate.

07:06.391 --> 07:08.255
Tell me that's not a good thing.

07:08.289 --> 07:09.981
I'll give you that.

07:10.015 --> 07:12.742
But you also tried to
book me for Vimalux.

07:12.777 --> 07:14.468
Seriously Taloor, Vimalux?

07:14.503 --> 07:16.505
A do-it-yourself gene splicer.

07:16.539 --> 07:18.403
Work is work, Desa.

07:18.438 --> 07:19.439
You were just getting started.

07:20.647 --> 07:21.855
InterMate is making
you a celebrity now.

07:23.926 --> 07:24.789
Yes, it is.

07:26.687 --> 07:27.964
I'm still on for the
Synesthesia project at eight?

07:29.379 --> 07:30.795
It's yours,
holo confirmed.

07:32.175 --> 07:34.315
Auto schedule finalized.

07:34.350 --> 07:35.593
Smooches.

07:44.981 --> 07:46.466
Desa, time for a quick
game of InterMate?

07:47.881 --> 07:49.607
These face paint
technologies haven't advanced

07:49.641 --> 07:51.781
for a thousand years.
I'm sorry Lleva, no.

07:51.816 --> 07:53.542
I have a holorecording at eight.

07:53.576 --> 07:55.164
I've got it all
set, no prob'lies.

07:55.198 --> 07:56.303
We'll do one with Iastar.

07:56.337 --> 07:57.994
Who's she?

07:58.029 --> 07:59.513
You'll love her.

07:59.548 --> 08:02.585
She's over 200, so
beautifully age-retarded.

08:02.620 --> 08:04.242
She's played just
about every game.

08:04.276 --> 08:07.210
Look, Lleva, I'm just the
spokesperson for InterMate.

08:07.245 --> 08:08.867
I just recite the words.

08:08.902 --> 08:11.387
I never play these
eccentric group games.

08:11.421 --> 08:12.630
I don't need to.

08:13.769 --> 08:15.253
Get out of your
hypocritical rut!

08:15.287 --> 08:16.530
I'm not hypocritical.

08:16.565 --> 08:18.152
I just like to keep things real.

08:18.187 --> 08:20.327
Channels S346.

08:20.361 --> 08:22.363
No, I have a holo
at eight!

08:36.101 --> 08:40.174
The perfect extreme
of ecstasy can be yours.

08:40.209 --> 08:43.799
Subscribe now to our blind
date alternate world game.

08:45.041 --> 08:47.388
Visit real worlds, not virtual.

08:54.119 --> 08:56.121
Welcome in, Iastar.

08:56.156 --> 08:58.399
Love when you make me
feel so inhabited.

08:59.677 --> 09:01.955
Say, I do have one
prime message.

09:03.612 --> 09:05.545
Hi, I'm keeping
our InterMate date.

09:06.960 --> 09:09.169
It's really like going
someplace else, isn't it?

09:09.203 --> 09:10.411
I know I'll see you there.

09:11.620 --> 09:13.656
We're hitting channels
S346, a four player.

09:31.329 --> 09:32.502
Hello - Hello.

09:38.232 --> 09:40.165
Yeah, you knew I'd be up for it.

09:40.200 --> 09:41.719
A flash of fun will do you good.

09:42.547 --> 09:43.583
Hello - Hello.

09:45.585 --> 09:46.551
Where's all the players?

09:56.216 --> 09:57.113
There.

10:00.289 --> 10:01.462
This should be a quick game.

10:05.121 --> 10:07.227
That's not a virtual player?

10:07.261 --> 10:09.022
It's the only one
here, it's real.

10:09.056 --> 10:10.057
Come on.

10:21.413 --> 10:22.449
Are you it?

10:24.624 --> 10:26.108
Wait, where you going?

10:26.142 --> 10:27.316
Chase him!

10:49.994 --> 10:50.891
Why are you chasing me?

10:50.926 --> 10:52.513
Why did you run?

10:52.548 --> 10:54.481
Because you coming at me.

10:54.515 --> 10:56.414
Time to focus.

10:56.448 --> 10:58.416
We know you're not
a virtual player.

10:58.450 --> 11:00.832
Mutually observed
reality ritual.

11:00.867 --> 11:02.316
Hey, hey, hey, I'm
warning you, step back.

11:06.113 --> 11:06.907
Flash time.

11:28.066 --> 11:29.309
He is only a virtual.

11:29.343 --> 11:29.965
Whoa.

11:31.242 --> 11:31.829
Where'd I go?

11:32.692 --> 11:34.003
Why didn't he disappear?

11:34.038 --> 11:35.142
It's wrong.

11:36.557 --> 11:38.145
A virtual player with
actual flashouts.

11:39.595 --> 11:40.665
Why aren't we feeling it?

11:41.217 --> 11:42.425
You want players?

11:43.047 --> 11:43.910
Follow me.

11:48.984 --> 11:49.674
Follow.

11:54.058 --> 11:56.785
It was my time now.

11:56.819 --> 12:00.064
I had the coordinates
for perfect interception.

12:00.098 --> 12:03.446
All I had to do was
intervene with their game,

12:03.481 --> 12:05.759
disrupt it in just
the right way.

12:32.199 --> 12:34.995
My plan was underway,

12:35.030 --> 12:37.687
a masterfully designed
intervention, finely tuned.

12:45.247 --> 12:46.455
Ladies, please

12:47.249 --> 12:48.043
let me be of service.

12:49.976 --> 12:50.770
You're cute.

12:58.398 --> 12:59.571
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh...

13:05.267 --> 13:06.268
There you go.

13:09.547 --> 13:11.411
You like it?

13:11.445 --> 13:13.551
It's new. I just got it.

13:13.585 --> 13:14.828
A little birthday present.

13:20.075 --> 13:22.663
Gentle now, gentle.

13:22.698 --> 13:24.976
Interesting, the
realtime hasn't run out.

13:25.011 --> 13:26.633
Interesting?

13:26.667 --> 13:28.221
I have a holorecording
to get to.

13:28.255 --> 13:29.394
Sit down, take it easy.

13:29.429 --> 13:31.569
You can work it out.

13:31.603 --> 13:36.194
It's like he's been
flashed out but not really.

13:36.229 --> 13:38.783
This does nothing.

13:38.818 --> 13:41.027
There's no escape game
circle, virtual sounds,

13:42.131 --> 13:43.443
fake reality encoder.

13:43.477 --> 13:45.583
Are these simulations?

13:45.617 --> 13:47.792
Excuse me, that's
soul music, baby.

13:49.898 --> 13:52.038
It's only her first
game of InterMate.

13:52.072 --> 13:54.316
You don't seem to
know what's going on.

13:54.350 --> 13:56.870
Where's the fourth player?

13:56.905 --> 13:59.562
You ladies always hitchhike
this far away from traffic?

13:59.597 --> 14:01.219
You must be Canadian.

14:01.254 --> 14:02.427
Yeah, it makes a lot of sense.

14:03.152 --> 14:04.257
Canadian?

14:35.460 --> 14:36.496
I had
diverted the women

14:36.530 --> 14:39.775
to another existing universe,

14:39.809 --> 14:43.744
chosen from the infinite
realities hospitable to human
life.

14:43.779 --> 14:47.610
It was a way to stress
the limits of their game.

14:47.645 --> 14:50.061
Stretching it between
two realities

14:50.096 --> 14:53.582
like an elastic deformation,
suspended and pulled

14:53.616 --> 14:54.859
to its breaking point.

15:00.244 --> 15:02.108
I had all details worked out.

15:12.842 --> 15:14.051
Here it is.

15:14.085 --> 15:14.983
What is this?

15:17.192 --> 15:18.641
Lots of players inside.

15:34.588 --> 15:38.454
This reality, a huge
spatial factor.

15:38.489 --> 15:40.387
Our second game, Lleva,
expect surprises.

15:40.422 --> 15:42.389
Sure, it's an upgrade.

15:42.424 --> 15:44.357
Virtual players, now
virtual flashouts.

16:19.495 --> 16:21.290
I made the
choice to confront them

16:21.325 --> 16:22.671
in a crowded situation.

16:26.157 --> 16:27.503
To disorient them.

16:29.609 --> 16:32.094
To split one of them
away from the other two.

16:42.242 --> 16:44.486
Hey old dude,

16:44.520 --> 16:46.453
I bet you miss the
disco days, huh?

16:48.766 --> 16:51.769
No insult, I'm a huge
fan of the eight-track.

16:52.425 --> 16:53.771
Just now appeared,

16:53.874 --> 16:56.118
uh, arrived.

16:56.981 --> 16:59.915
Good timing, your
'70's world is back.

16:59.949 --> 17:01.089
My world doesn't matter.

17:02.780 --> 17:04.782
Got that right, universe sucks.

17:06.611 --> 17:08.544
We're all part of the
same sucky reality game.

17:10.408 --> 17:13.101
Universes kept separate always.

17:13.135 --> 17:14.930
That's the reality game.

17:14.964 --> 17:16.966
You rule, dude.

17:18.106 --> 17:21.350
You a Nintendo core fan or
still playing Donkey Kong?

17:22.593 --> 17:24.595
Just use the humans

17:28.599 --> 17:30.566
to short circuit InterMate.

17:31.395 --> 17:33.466
Humans?

17:33.500 --> 17:36.434
Three women playing with chaos.

17:36.469 --> 17:39.506
Hacking into, corrupting
the multiverse.

17:39.541 --> 17:41.474
You use chicks?

17:42.268 --> 17:44.270
Like live chicks?

17:45.685 --> 17:48.826
It doesn't matter, it is
nothing you would notice.

17:50.034 --> 17:52.036
These chicks, they here?

17:52.140 --> 17:55.004
I do not care what
becomes of them.

17:55.039 --> 17:57.041
As long as their
game is destroyed.

18:08.984 --> 18:10.399
Haven't we

18:10.434 --> 18:12.263
You should maybe come with me.

18:18.511 --> 18:19.753
Only I
could break the rules

18:19.788 --> 18:21.100
of their four player game.

18:23.654 --> 18:25.345
By getting one of them alone.

18:25.380 --> 18:27.589
Using her to activate my plan.

18:50.059 --> 18:51.716
Soon, I only had to watch

18:51.992 --> 18:52.993
and wonder.

18:54.478 --> 18:56.618
Why do human body forms

18:56.652 --> 18:59.793
have this compulsion
towards mass wiggling, as if

18:59.828 --> 19:04.004
in this reality mindlessness
is somehow necessary.

19:55.608 --> 19:57.644
I refuse to get stuck here.

19:57.679 --> 19:59.543
Playing this game
was a big mistake.

19:59.577 --> 20:00.682
The game's not
functioning, seems jammed,

20:00.716 --> 20:02.546
and not just the flash.

20:02.580 --> 20:04.824
It was the
situation I wanted,

20:04.858 --> 20:07.758
a neutral reality
to disorient them.

20:07.792 --> 20:09.932
For all I know, you're
incompetent players.

20:09.967 --> 20:11.382
Both of you.

20:11.417 --> 20:12.866
This reality won't
collapse by itself.

20:12.901 --> 20:14.351
We've got to the find
the fourth player.

20:15.869 --> 20:17.043
Where's Lleva?

20:51.836 --> 20:54.149
I never balled any
of his friends yet.

20:55.357 --> 20:57.635
Hey, buy some molly?

20:58.740 --> 21:00.535
Virtual, just simulated.

21:02.433 --> 21:03.883
Pharmaceutical, moron!

21:06.403 --> 21:07.749
Lleva!

21:10.061 --> 21:12.340
I feel like these people
are starting to look

21:12.374 --> 21:12.719
real.

21:16.585 --> 21:18.794
Well maybe we're the
virtual people.

21:18.829 --> 21:20.244
It's like you're
reading my mind.

21:20.279 --> 21:22.936
I'm having these insights.

21:22.971 --> 21:24.800
Well, wake up.

21:24.835 --> 21:26.630
I'm missing another
holorecording.

21:26.664 --> 21:28.183
Doesn't matter, Desa.

21:28.217 --> 21:30.323
We've got to stick together
to get this game unstuck.

21:30.358 --> 21:32.014
You guys stay stuck.

21:32.049 --> 21:33.533
I don't have your
kind of timeless time

21:33.568 --> 21:35.121
to figure this out.

21:35.155 --> 21:37.296
Desa, wait!

21:37.330 --> 21:38.676
I feel like someone's
playing with this reality.

21:38.711 --> 21:40.333
Not now, Lleva,
we're losing Desa.

21:40.368 --> 21:43.094
Slowly! They tell me fast, fast!

21:43.129 --> 21:44.510
I wanna eat slowly!

21:44.544 --> 21:45.925
They tell me fast!

21:45.959 --> 21:47.306
Fast! Fast!

21:47.340 --> 21:49.446
Fast!...fast!

21:49.480 --> 21:50.309
Fast!

21:52.311 --> 21:53.381
Fast!

21:58.869 --> 22:00.353
I'll be in my room
in two minutes.

22:00.388 --> 22:02.700
I want her young,
I want her slim,

22:02.735 --> 22:05.082
and most of all, I want
her fast, like now.

22:16.852 --> 22:19.372
Yo, out of
the way, douche bag.

22:19.407 --> 22:21.374
Not a mere routine work order.

22:36.700 --> 22:39.323
Wow, here already?

22:39.358 --> 22:40.531
Are you the player?

22:40.566 --> 22:42.568
Am I ever, baby.

22:57.445 --> 22:59.412
Oh yeah, baby.

23:09.353 --> 23:10.389
Ohhhh!

23:13.771 --> 23:14.531
Hello.

23:16.222 --> 23:17.223
Hello.

23:19.190 --> 23:21.538
Hi, what's going on?

23:21.572 --> 23:23.022
Did this guy double order?

23:24.264 --> 23:26.508
Are you from an agency?

23:26.543 --> 23:28.061
Or did you get an
independent call?

23:28.303 --> 23:29.304
Uh.

23:29.338 --> 23:30.236
Uhmm...

23:30.478 --> 23:31.651
Speak up 'cause I
had an appointment

23:31.686 --> 23:32.618
with this guy right now.

23:43.974 --> 23:45.251
I am Desa.

23:45.285 --> 23:46.839
Great, hi Desa.

23:46.873 --> 23:49.186
Did you jack my client or what?

23:49.220 --> 23:50.532
He is not a player.

23:51.119 --> 23:53.777
Well, he might not be
a player but I am.

24:14.004 --> 24:15.350
Wait up a second.

24:15.557 --> 24:17.076
What are you doing?

24:17.110 --> 24:20.113
Look, hey, back there.

24:20.251 --> 24:21.460
What was that?

24:22.081 --> 24:23.358
It's a game.

24:23.392 --> 24:25.118
A game, so you control it,

24:25.153 --> 24:26.706
because it was excellent.

24:26.741 --> 24:28.467
I just need to find my friends.

24:28.501 --> 24:29.329
There's more of you?

24:29.364 --> 24:30.710
Here.

24:30.745 --> 24:31.849
Is that what you're looking for?

24:31.884 --> 24:32.263
Thank you.

24:32.816 --> 24:33.886
Yeah, how it works.

24:35.439 --> 24:37.752
It's like a kennel that
moves, now get in.

24:40.962 --> 24:41.963
Desa!

24:48.383 --> 24:49.384
Desa.

24:54.631 --> 24:55.735
Hi -

24:55.770 --> 24:56.425
Ahh...

24:57.392 --> 24:58.807
Good to find you alone.

24:58.842 --> 24:59.670
What?

24:59.705 --> 25:01.051
I don't have time.

25:01.085 --> 25:01.396
A little only attention,
it's important.

25:04.710 --> 25:05.676
Hey!

25:05.711 --> 25:07.713
Iastar - Desa

25:07.747 --> 25:09.128
Hands off the lady,
slime. The guy's filth.

25:09.162 --> 25:11.406
Wait, I am not.

25:12.959 --> 25:14.029
Purely accidental.

25:14.064 --> 25:16.066
Umm, coincidence.

25:16.169 --> 25:17.032
Ummm...

25:18.447 --> 25:20.760
Normal local habitant.

25:20.967 --> 25:22.210
Okay, perv.

25:22.244 --> 25:22.900
You two are friends?

25:22.935 --> 25:24.350
Us three.

25:24.384 --> 25:25.627
What happened to Lleva now?

25:25.662 --> 25:27.215
We have to find her.

25:27.249 --> 25:28.527
The door's this way. Let's go.

25:31.737 --> 25:33.117
They tell me fast!

25:33.152 --> 25:35.637
I wanna eat slowly but
they tell me fast!

25:35.672 --> 25:37.639
Fast! I wanna eat slowly,

25:37.674 --> 25:38.709
slowly, they want.

25:40.677 --> 25:42.541
Where did she go?

25:42.575 --> 25:44.819
My car's parked across
the street, come on.

25:44.853 --> 25:47.200
Fast! I wanna eat slowly.

25:47.787 --> 25:49.478
They tell me, they
tell me fast! fast!

26:11.639 --> 26:12.571
Whoo!

26:17.058 --> 26:19.543
Round, nobody gets
round anymore.

26:23.409 --> 26:25.514
Jesus, fuck.

26:25.549 --> 26:27.068
Simple cellular programing.

26:28.656 --> 26:30.416
How would you like to
take a ride with me?

26:30.450 --> 26:31.659
On this?

26:31.693 --> 26:34.800
Yes, on this, a bike, a bus.

26:34.834 --> 26:36.629
Shit, I'll even let you
pull the train. -

26:36.664 --> 26:39.494
Why don't you jump on?

26:39.528 --> 26:41.392
I'm gonna need you
to hold tight.

26:52.852 --> 26:54.371
Oh, those are my friends.

26:54.405 --> 26:55.648
Lleva!

26:55.683 --> 26:56.822
Damn, they're your friends?

26:56.856 --> 26:57.857
Uh-huh.

26:59.169 --> 27:01.205
Tell you what, why don't
you tell 'em to run with us?

27:01.240 --> 27:02.344
What's up, girl?

27:03.587 --> 27:04.623
Where you going?

27:18.015 --> 27:19.154
What was that?

27:19.189 --> 27:20.673
Are looking for a gang bang?

27:20.708 --> 27:22.157
What are you doing?

27:22.192 --> 27:23.469
We can't get hurt.

27:23.503 --> 27:24.953
This is a micro-universe.

27:24.988 --> 27:26.437
It may be micro but
it's always real.

27:26.472 --> 27:28.198
You can get killed here.

27:28.232 --> 27:30.614
A game is guaranteed safe.

27:30.649 --> 27:32.651
Yeah, well you better
ask for a refund.

28:01.334 --> 28:04.337
I thought it was
supposed to be a simple job.

28:08.065 --> 28:10.171
Still, I figured I'd
been resourceful.

28:13.933 --> 28:17.903
I had credentials,
currency, all in order.

28:19.042 --> 28:21.700
Radio Telescope
Antenna Complex

28:22.701 --> 28:24.979
The walk here had
gone on and on.

28:27.947 --> 28:29.293
Into the dark

28:30.467 --> 28:32.469
but I had a reason.

28:33.677 --> 28:36.991
My assignment, a routine repair,

28:37.025 --> 28:39.165
disable a certain
quantum interference.

28:41.064 --> 28:42.997
Nevermind, it's
weak work orders.

28:44.723 --> 28:47.104
I had a more permanent remedy,

28:47.139 --> 28:49.797
my own plan to protect
the multiverse.

28:50.832 --> 28:52.800
This InterMate game needed to be

28:52.834 --> 28:54.629
so it had never even existed.

28:59.461 --> 29:02.119
Those three women, my key to
severing my outstretched link

29:02.154 --> 29:03.880
from their world to this world,

29:03.914 --> 29:05.744
blowing out their outlaw game.

29:08.229 --> 29:09.609
I knew I could do that.

29:11.646 --> 29:13.475
I just had to find them again.

29:21.276 --> 29:23.278
It's warm already.

29:26.454 --> 29:27.317
We got one more observation.

29:27.351 --> 29:29.181
Like piss.

29:29.215 --> 29:32.805
It's a stellar source
frequency in NGC3516.

29:32.840 --> 29:33.944
Just what I need, overtime.

29:41.503 --> 29:44.506
Ah...Reality readout.

29:44.748 --> 29:47.337
Search three unit
anomaly, locate.

29:47.371 --> 29:49.511
Class Four reality.

29:49.546 --> 29:53.446
Mega-universe Y321E48,
expansion type two.

29:58.210 --> 29:59.211
What?

30:00.453 --> 30:01.592
I thought I heard something.

30:03.215 --> 30:05.527
Wait, that is my universe.

30:05.562 --> 30:07.322
I did not ask for memory.

30:07.357 --> 30:08.668
You have neglected

30:08.703 --> 30:11.361
to select appropriate
adjustment programs.

30:11.395 --> 30:13.984
Please re-access.

30:14.019 --> 30:17.608
Why did I have to choose this
entropy infested universe?

30:17.643 --> 30:19.887
No auto quantum pairing
communicode service.

30:19.921 --> 30:21.716
It's just tracking Voyager 2.

30:24.236 --> 30:26.790
Are you listening?

30:26.825 --> 30:28.240
There are three additional
beings mislocated

30:28.274 --> 30:30.829
in this reality.

30:30.863 --> 30:32.658
No multiversal
fluent conversate service

30:32.692 --> 30:34.349
this interverse node.

30:35.178 --> 30:37.283
So language it your way.

30:37.318 --> 30:39.423
Your function to repair.

30:39.458 --> 30:41.598
As Licensed Reality
Repair Agent,

30:41.632 --> 30:42.702
you are programmed for
precise protocols.

30:42.737 --> 30:44.739
I am not programmed.

30:45.153 --> 30:46.810
Ahh, except language.

30:49.019 --> 30:51.573
I have a work order,
locate anomaly.

30:51.608 --> 30:53.852
A triumph of analysis,

30:53.886 --> 30:56.095
processing near random
events in the sample field.

30:56.130 --> 30:58.787
Just give the
locationary reading.

30:58.822 --> 31:00.513
Always have your
locationary coordinates.

31:00.548 --> 31:02.722
Find do I where the players.

31:02.757 --> 31:04.690
Your anomaly
coordinate data adjusted

31:04.724 --> 31:07.037
for local communicode interface.

31:07.072 --> 31:09.729
It is my job on the
talk we are blocking.

31:09.764 --> 31:13.181
900-555-0198.

31:17.530 --> 31:19.567
Reference numbers again.

31:19.601 --> 31:21.569
I know galactic prefixes.

31:23.053 --> 31:25.607
I have to been to numberless
parallel universes.

31:25.642 --> 31:26.850
Not reference.

31:27.540 --> 31:28.507
Telephone number.

31:42.279 --> 31:43.280
Anything?

31:44.005 --> 31:45.386
Emergency.

31:45.420 --> 31:48.423
Backfeed, nine signal minimode.

31:48.458 --> 31:49.148
What's going on?

31:51.495 --> 31:53.773
The dish, it's sweeping!

31:55.327 --> 31:56.431
Cut the power!

32:02.368 --> 32:03.991
Hey, where's your hard pass?

32:04.025 --> 32:05.509
No!

32:05.544 --> 32:07.580
What the hell are you doing
here? All right game over, pal.

32:07.615 --> 32:08.167
Come on.

32:08.202 --> 32:09.203
Ohhh!

33:45.368 --> 33:47.508
Well it's great.

33:47.542 --> 33:49.924
Yeah, it's a whole new product.

33:49.958 --> 33:52.616
Oh, it is better
than full service.

33:52.651 --> 33:55.688
Is it kinky?

33:55.723 --> 33:58.277
It's beyond kinky and
it's ours exclusively.

33:58.312 --> 34:00.383
Hold on.

34:00.417 --> 34:01.936
You are all that
they're asking for.

34:03.110 --> 34:04.421
Not that they don't
love you, Nastya.

34:04.456 --> 34:05.629
Or you, Angel.

34:07.183 --> 34:08.494
You're just the new flavor.

34:09.323 --> 34:10.669
Yeah, so what's it gonna be?

34:12.257 --> 34:14.466
Okay great, I'll have you give
your information to Nastya

34:14.500 --> 34:16.054
and then we'll be right over.

34:18.746 --> 34:20.782
This new ad is working great.

34:20.817 --> 34:22.336
You girls are gonna find your

34:22.370 --> 34:23.992
fourth player or whatever it is.

34:24.027 --> 34:25.891
Just trust me.

34:25.925 --> 34:26.995
I don't get this, I
don't get any of it.

34:28.790 --> 34:30.965
Well, better than being
on the streets, right?

34:36.798 --> 34:39.767
So like, how do you, you know...

34:39.801 --> 34:41.631
do that without doing it?

34:42.666 --> 34:44.185
A technique of mental focus.

34:46.084 --> 34:47.706
Then flash bam?

34:48.224 --> 34:49.466
Exactly.

34:51.158 --> 34:52.745
I have to be careful.

34:52.780 --> 34:54.161
It happens too easily
in this reality.

34:56.197 --> 34:58.475
Do you think there is a reality?

34:58.510 --> 34:59.959
Karen says there
are dances here.

35:01.306 --> 35:02.479
Lap dancing.

35:03.722 --> 35:05.033
Like in the Hologuild legends.

35:07.588 --> 35:09.452
Like in Cactus Strip Lounge.

35:11.592 --> 35:13.559
I like that, live performance.

35:15.458 --> 35:16.597
Way live, honey.

35:18.357 --> 35:20.014
No simulation but real.

35:21.671 --> 35:24.018
Normally, I balance
phoneme to function ratios.

35:24.052 --> 35:26.054
I am sure you do.

35:26.986 --> 35:29.575
Normally we weren't meant
to disturb our reality.

35:29.610 --> 35:30.576
No games,

35:30.611 --> 35:32.578
just live in it.

35:33.303 --> 35:34.477
Yeah.

35:36.582 --> 35:38.791
Like there's some
kind of cosmic law.

35:44.211 --> 35:45.384
Yeah.

36:59.147 --> 37:02.772
I should've been
out of this reality long ago.

37:06.465 --> 37:08.881
At least I had a second chance,

37:08.916 --> 37:10.952
a locationary number
from this world.

37:12.091 --> 37:13.714
I really needed it.

37:13.748 --> 37:15.233
I lost my multiverse meter.

37:17.200 --> 37:19.720
I had to find one of the women.

37:19.754 --> 37:23.482
Get her alone, short
circuit her reality game.

37:23.517 --> 37:26.761
Or I'd be stuck in this
motel universe forever.

37:45.470 --> 37:48.611
Hello, extra sensual flashouts.

37:49.543 --> 37:53.478
Coordinates, I mean, number for

37:53.512 --> 37:54.686
three travelers.

37:55.721 --> 37:57.240
To fly you where?

37:57.344 --> 37:59.311
You have them, the women?

37:59.725 --> 38:01.417
Of course women, escorts.

38:03.211 --> 38:05.352
Escorts.

38:05.386 --> 38:07.664
We have the best, first class.

38:07.699 --> 38:09.217
Where to send them?

38:10.253 --> 38:11.668
You send them?

38:11.703 --> 38:14.050
Then who are you?

38:14.844 --> 38:17.605
Wait, you make fun about me?

38:17.640 --> 38:18.813
I mean...

38:21.333 --> 38:25.233
I've been with trouble
to know who I am today.

38:26.027 --> 38:28.340
Ohh, poor honey.

38:28.375 --> 38:30.756
I right away fix you.

38:30.791 --> 38:32.620
Three new escorts to take
you out of this world.

38:32.655 --> 38:33.276
Three that will--

38:33.311 --> 38:34.450
No, no,

38:35.451 --> 38:38.143
Just want one.

38:39.144 --> 38:41.836
Townhouse
Motel, room 156.

38:41.871 --> 38:45.737
Fine, one escort,
Townhouse Motel, room 156.

38:49.741 --> 38:51.156
Prepare blast off.

38:54.193 --> 38:58.232
I kept telling
myself it was a simple job.

38:58.266 --> 39:01.097
Their own game would destroy
itself.

39:01.131 --> 39:03.064
Soon as I could activate
the flashout effect

39:03.099 --> 39:05.619
with one of them alone.

39:05.653 --> 39:08.380
She'd think I'd be just
another virtual person.

39:08.415 --> 39:09.899
She wouldn't know who I am.

39:28.642 --> 39:30.885
Is this the usual?

39:30.920 --> 39:33.819
Yeah, you collect payment,
flashout, off we go.

39:35.373 --> 39:36.650
I don't see the point.

39:36.684 --> 39:38.237
Don't you get bored with this?

39:38.272 --> 39:40.757
Yes, but I just take these.

39:44.382 --> 39:46.384
Go ahead, try one.

39:46.694 --> 39:47.799
What are they?

39:48.593 --> 39:51.112
Get you loaded.

39:51.147 --> 39:54.530
PCP spiked with a time-release
equivalent of amyl nitrate.

39:54.564 --> 39:57.153
Then I add a dash of
ketamine hydrochloride.

39:58.534 --> 40:00.743
With this, real people
don't bother you.

40:00.777 --> 40:03.055
They're just a bunch of worms.

40:03.090 --> 40:04.263
I'm fine.

40:10.131 --> 40:11.236
Suit yourself.

40:20.348 --> 40:21.660
It's open.

40:25.250 --> 40:27.459
You're the perv.

40:27.494 --> 40:29.047
You stopped me at the hotel.

40:30.773 --> 40:34.017
Yes, but come left in.

40:35.812 --> 40:38.194
These are proper
circumstances for us.

40:40.645 --> 40:41.784
You're not like the
other so-called

40:41.818 --> 40:43.475
similar simulations here.

40:43.510 --> 40:44.718
Because I saw you before.

40:45.857 --> 40:49.516
Before they had your
locationary code.

40:53.243 --> 40:55.556
I'll make it double
the trouble usual.

41:02.218 --> 41:03.461
Big come now.

41:04.841 --> 41:08.466
Just one of those little
flash-flashes for me,

41:09.708 --> 41:10.847
and then we'll be doing fine.

41:11.883 --> 41:13.160
I suppose there's no harm.

41:15.714 --> 41:16.888
What are you doing?

41:16.922 --> 41:18.303
Your neck, look at your neck.

41:18.337 --> 41:19.269
Ohhh!

41:19.304 --> 41:20.478
Angel!

41:26.138 --> 41:27.174
Angel!

41:29.487 --> 41:30.488
Awww!

41:31.868 --> 41:32.731
Hey!

41:39.566 --> 41:40.912
Get in the car.

41:43.293 --> 41:44.605
I'll collect payment.

41:49.921 --> 41:51.474
Fry enough gray matter
to make you nice.

41:52.613 --> 41:53.787
Now swallow that, there you go.

41:59.240 --> 42:00.656
Have fun with that, shithead.

42:02.796 --> 42:04.452
What the hell's going on?

42:04.487 --> 42:05.971
What kind of animal
you let in here?

42:06.006 --> 42:07.559
The dude inside is cranked.

42:15.740 --> 42:18.259
Something unnatural about him.

42:18.294 --> 42:21.297
What happen to your
famous flashout zap-out?

42:21.331 --> 42:23.679
It's a mental focus, fear
blocks it in this reality.

42:26.267 --> 42:28.166
What in
the name of the lord?

42:29.788 --> 42:31.963
Get me out of this mind!

42:33.309 --> 42:34.621
Angel dust?

42:36.588 --> 42:38.763
What did you do to the lamp?

42:38.797 --> 42:42.629
Keep people in their
own whirls... words...

42:43.871 --> 42:45.148
worlds.

42:46.840 --> 42:48.911
Did you just take
a dump on my bed?

42:53.191 --> 42:54.572
Watch out, behind you!

42:56.401 --> 42:57.575
In front of you!

42:59.473 --> 43:01.613
Are you one of the

43:02.269 --> 43:03.477
shitheads?

43:03.511 --> 43:04.512
Ahhh!

43:07.792 --> 43:09.000
Oh hell.

43:10.898 --> 43:12.072
Shitfire.

43:14.522 --> 43:17.940
Can't get out of this mind.

43:26.086 --> 43:28.502
Either reality is
very fragile or my mind is.

43:31.816 --> 43:33.507
I have to find out what's
in those micro-crystals.

43:34.681 --> 43:36.544
Maybe quantum pairs.

43:36.579 --> 43:37.822
It's unknown materials science!

43:37.856 --> 43:39.202
This makes no sense, Frank.

43:39.513 --> 43:40.410
It's an impossible device.

43:40.445 --> 43:42.240
I got a voice readout.

43:42.274 --> 43:44.691
Couldn't have repeated
any numbers but it did.

43:44.725 --> 43:46.934
You know, a guy breached
security and he roughed up a
tech.

43:46.969 --> 43:48.418
I want to know who he works for.

43:48.453 --> 43:50.282
Not for anyone on this planet.

43:50.317 --> 43:53.872
Look, this is extreme
game changing technology.

43:53.907 --> 43:56.392
You know, you spend your
days and nights listening

43:56.426 --> 43:58.497
to the universe, trying to see

43:58.532 --> 44:00.223
if there's anything
else out there.

44:00.258 --> 44:02.225
You really think now the cosmos

44:02.260 --> 44:04.642
just dropped proof into
Annette's lap.

44:05.366 --> 44:07.265
Idiot.

44:07.299 --> 44:08.266
You think it's Siri, Frank?

44:08.300 --> 44:10.337
Look at it!

44:10.371 --> 44:12.580
There no semi-conductors,
no friendly lady microchips.

44:12.615 --> 44:14.375
It's not earthly technology.

44:14.410 --> 44:15.687
You know, it's not
your department.

44:15.722 --> 44:17.102
You brought this to me.

44:18.172 --> 44:19.553
It's a security breach.

44:19.587 --> 44:21.555
If we don't know who the user is

44:21.589 --> 44:23.764
we're gonna ship it off to
Washington. - They'll bury it!

44:23.799 --> 44:25.801
I had to develop new
techniques just to access it,

44:25.835 --> 44:27.699
which got me a voice
readout, a series of numbers.

44:28.113 --> 44:29.149
A code?

44:31.151 --> 44:32.393
Okay, well, we're gonna
ship it off to Fort Meade.

44:32.428 --> 44:33.187
They'll decode it.

44:33.222 --> 44:34.154
I already did.

44:35.500 --> 44:37.709
Just one phrase only,
a phone number.

44:37.744 --> 44:39.297
I'm checking it out now.

44:39.331 --> 44:40.988
You might want to sit down.

44:41.023 --> 44:41.886
A phone number?

44:44.682 --> 44:46.994
And only I know it.

44:47.029 --> 44:48.789
So Frank, you wanna track down
the source of this device?

44:49.341 --> 44:50.411
Oh geez.

44:50.446 --> 44:52.172
Right.

44:52.206 --> 44:54.553
Turns out they have a
serious front operation.

44:54.588 --> 44:56.038
They'll send over a woman

44:56.072 --> 44:57.177
that will take you
out of this world.

44:57.211 --> 44:58.385
It's crazy stuff.

44:59.420 --> 45:00.732
I'm working on it.

45:09.292 --> 45:10.466
Time for our medicine.

45:10.500 --> 45:12.744
It is not me.

45:12.779 --> 45:15.471
Space habitat agents didn't it.

45:16.679 --> 45:19.406
Door them in, trap
them...their game.

45:19.440 --> 45:20.890
Lemme get me get them!

45:20.925 --> 45:22.650
We're not coherent yet, are we?

45:23.790 --> 45:25.343
This body programmed
for good English.

45:25.377 --> 45:27.207
Don't worry.

45:27.241 --> 45:28.691
We get recreational
OD's all the time.

45:36.354 --> 45:38.183
Hold it, baby, there you go.

45:43.016 --> 45:46.778
Little pills superimpose
pseudo reality.

45:48.262 --> 45:50.471
Make mind leak out.

45:50.506 --> 45:52.094
You'll be fine in a moment.

46:42.938 --> 46:45.388
Hello, extra
sensual flashouts.

46:45.423 --> 46:47.045
Needing girl, quick.

46:47.080 --> 46:48.529
You are where?

46:48.564 --> 46:49.703
Counting Hospital.

46:49.737 --> 46:51.878
County Mental Hospital.

46:51.912 --> 46:53.569
For leaving .. out.

46:53.603 --> 46:56.123
Getting out this afternoon?

46:56.158 --> 46:58.367
Big help me.

46:58.401 --> 47:00.058
You deserving escort.

47:01.473 --> 47:04.718
Has to be one of the
flashy new ones.

47:07.203 --> 47:08.549
Oh, hell no.

47:10.206 --> 47:14.486
They have a game, game
within our game, InterMate.

47:14.521 --> 47:17.213
They could learn to
create themselves.

47:17.248 --> 47:18.974
Ahhh! ...Awww!

47:24.186 --> 47:27.223
Ahh, I'm beginning to
diswant keeping people

47:27.258 --> 47:28.569
out of their own realities.

47:29.570 --> 47:30.848
I know just how you feel.

47:33.436 --> 47:36.543
It's the Protectors,
Protectors of the Multiverse.

47:37.855 --> 47:41.479
They can't let just
anyone create universes,

47:41.513 --> 47:43.550
tip incomprehensible balances,

47:45.207 --> 47:48.589
disrupt the forces
of space and time.

47:51.765 --> 47:53.560
You wouldn't want to risk

47:55.217 --> 47:57.219
the disintegration of
all existence, would you?

47:59.393 --> 48:01.533
So the Protectors, they're
paranoid, aren't they?

48:01.568 --> 48:02.569
Huh?

48:04.778 --> 48:08.920
That's not really my concern.

48:08.955 --> 48:10.128
Mm-hmm.

48:11.992 --> 48:12.924
Come on, baby.

48:14.615 --> 48:15.996
You a strange one, baby.

48:20.104 --> 48:21.657
Just what I need for
when the next player

48:21.691 --> 48:22.900
decides to get rough.

48:23.659 --> 48:25.247
Yeah, next time I
might not be there

48:25.281 --> 48:26.800
to save your ass.

48:26.834 --> 48:28.388
I won't stand being
thrown around.

48:28.422 --> 48:30.838
It won't happen again, Iastar.

48:30.873 --> 48:33.013
Not in any universe, I'm
through playing your game.

48:33.048 --> 48:35.119
Look, I've given
each of you a phone

48:35.153 --> 48:37.052
and I've shown you
how to use it,

48:37.086 --> 48:39.261
so I can track where you're
at or you can call me.

48:40.020 --> 48:41.539
You're still looking for
your fourth player, right?

48:43.230 --> 48:44.922
I mean, do we really
have a choice, Iastar?

48:46.751 --> 48:48.201
We are homeless
on this universe.

48:52.136 --> 48:54.034
Extra sensual flashouts,

48:54.069 --> 48:55.484
girls that take you
out of this world.

48:56.830 --> 48:58.004
Yeah, got your request.

49:00.316 --> 49:01.662
We were busy.

49:02.491 --> 49:03.837
That's kinda far.

49:06.253 --> 49:08.255
Yeah, see what we can do.

49:09.670 --> 49:10.568
Who was that?

49:10.602 --> 49:12.259
RTA.

49:12.294 --> 49:13.364
That tech bitch again?

49:13.398 --> 49:14.572
Yup.

49:14.606 --> 49:16.470
Well, I told you
to blow her off.

49:16.505 --> 49:17.816
She offered to pay
double this time.

49:17.851 --> 49:19.059
It doesn't matter.

49:19.094 --> 49:20.785
Who is RTA?

49:22.028 --> 49:23.891
Space place, rockets
and junk like that.

49:25.031 --> 49:26.825
They'll take you
out of this world.

49:28.172 --> 49:30.415
I can't have you girls
become a lab experiment.

49:30.450 --> 49:31.796
They're always looking
for friends of yours.

49:31.830 --> 49:33.832
You know, little green men type.

49:34.557 --> 49:35.765
Where were you educated?

49:35.800 --> 49:37.008
This toxic planet?

49:37.043 --> 49:39.045
Yeah...why?

49:39.183 --> 49:41.150
I'll take this RTA job.

49:41.185 --> 49:42.703
What?

49:42.738 --> 49:44.705
Iastar, you're not
gonna take that job.

49:44.740 --> 49:45.741
Iastar!

49:48.330 --> 49:50.021
Would you get her
back here please?

49:51.471 --> 49:52.541
Thank you so much.

50:02.033 --> 50:05.036
Hey, we need you back inside.

50:05.071 --> 50:07.418
Will you take me
there, to this RTA?

50:07.452 --> 50:08.833
Karen thinks it's not worth it.

50:10.455 --> 50:11.663
This worth it?

50:17.428 --> 50:18.636
Oh yeah.

50:34.755 --> 50:37.275
Desa, sweetie, go see what's up.

50:37.310 --> 50:39.760
I don't want you girls
getting separated.

50:39.795 --> 50:42.108
Okay, I guess we did
come as a trio act.

50:54.637 --> 50:55.535
Lose someone?

50:57.399 --> 50:58.020
Yeah.

51:00.022 --> 51:01.920
My friends, they
just walked out.

51:01.955 --> 51:03.577
Yeah, I saw 'em drive
off a second ago.

51:03.612 --> 51:05.131
Where?

51:05.165 --> 51:06.511
Right up the street.

51:06.546 --> 51:07.892
You want a ride?

51:09.066 --> 51:10.446
Would you mind?

51:10.481 --> 51:11.689
Not at all.

51:17.419 --> 51:18.040
I'm Matthew.

51:18.075 --> 51:18.937
Desa.

51:19.766 --> 51:21.216
Well it's nice to
meet you, Desa.

51:21.733 --> 51:23.080
I like your nails.

51:23.701 --> 51:25.875
Thank you.

51:25.910 --> 51:27.463
One of the nicest
things you can do.

51:27.498 --> 51:28.602
Help someone out.

52:40.433 --> 52:42.089
My, uhh...

52:43.850 --> 52:45.058
escort.

52:45.541 --> 52:46.784
You know who I am?

52:47.957 --> 52:49.787
Quick, let's go. Push me out.

52:51.306 --> 52:52.514
Like normal.

52:53.204 --> 52:54.205
Like normal?

52:55.620 --> 52:57.864
In this world, if we
do not leave now,

52:59.762 --> 53:01.178
it could be your last collapse.

53:03.318 --> 53:06.079
Collapse, as in InterMate?

53:07.218 --> 53:08.357
Ahhh...

53:11.912 --> 53:13.914
Can't taste time now.

53:14.225 --> 53:15.537
Push me.

53:31.518 --> 53:33.520
Ahh...Ahhh.

53:38.422 --> 53:41.666
You keep track of visitors
but don't bother us.

53:44.290 --> 53:46.602
Paging Dr
Stateman, Dr Stateman please.

54:03.378 --> 54:05.897
So, where are they?

54:05.932 --> 54:07.244
You said they were just ahead.

54:09.418 --> 54:10.799
Did I say that?

54:11.455 --> 54:12.801
Yes, you did.

54:15.355 --> 54:17.875
You look so healthy.

54:17.909 --> 54:20.257
You're lucky, you can
come home with me.

54:21.499 --> 54:22.673
You don't understand.

54:24.330 --> 54:27.436
You could just write 'em
a note, explain it later.

54:27.471 --> 54:28.782
Write them a note?

54:28.817 --> 54:30.646
But I'm looking for my friends.

54:30.681 --> 54:32.165
And I'm helping you.

54:33.339 --> 54:35.272
Then how much further are they?

54:37.481 --> 54:38.551
Not far.

54:39.621 --> 54:41.036
No one's gonna be there.

54:42.762 --> 54:44.867
When we get to
where we're going,

54:44.902 --> 54:47.042
I want you to get
out of the car,

54:47.076 --> 54:48.975
take off all your
clothes for me.

54:51.080 --> 54:53.117
Would you get whatever that
is away from me, please?

54:54.912 --> 54:57.915
See, I'm an okay guy.

54:59.503 --> 55:01.850
And I'm an okay girl.

55:08.719 --> 55:10.065
I'll take that.

55:11.377 --> 55:13.033
No phones, Desa.

55:14.966 --> 55:16.554
If you tell anyone about this,

55:18.038 --> 55:19.868
I'll make sure we see
each other again.

55:20.662 --> 55:21.801
Real soon.

55:23.630 --> 55:25.045
Do you wanna see me again?

55:25.080 --> 55:26.668
No, I don't think
you're an okay guy.

55:28.359 --> 55:29.981
They always say that.

55:35.849 --> 55:38.852
We flashout now. Now
is a good chance.

55:38.887 --> 55:41.061
It takes four of us to break
the link with this reality.

55:41.096 --> 55:43.270
This is a two player game.

55:43.305 --> 55:45.272
I selected a four
player. Me, Iaster, Desa.

55:45.307 --> 55:46.550
I selected a two!

55:46.584 --> 55:48.275
Flashout now!

55:53.695 --> 55:55.662
Even if you did, the
others do not belong.

55:56.698 --> 55:58.458
Now come on, you want to get out

55:58.493 --> 55:59.563
of this universe, don't you?

56:00.771 --> 56:03.049
Of course I do but I
can't leave my friends.

56:04.257 --> 56:06.397
I take your word.

56:06.432 --> 56:09.262
Ah... it must be a tangle in
the crossed InterMate channels.

56:10.574 --> 56:12.541
These things really
aren't uncommon.

56:13.956 --> 56:15.510
I haven't thought of that.

56:16.821 --> 56:20.135
But it means you and I
have to flashout now.

56:21.378 --> 56:22.793
Then we can all return.

56:24.104 --> 56:25.589
Obviously I can't end
this game without you,

56:25.623 --> 56:26.348
but even if you're right--

56:26.383 --> 56:27.729
If I am right?

56:27.763 --> 56:29.075
You will see.

56:30.283 --> 56:31.664
You have no stuff to lose.

56:31.698 --> 56:34.183
If I am wrong, no harm.

56:34.218 --> 56:36.427
No, you must relieve me.

56:36.462 --> 56:37.946
There is beally no problem.

56:46.333 --> 56:47.818
You can trust me.

56:47.852 --> 56:49.751
This crazy world is
making you suspicious.

56:49.785 --> 56:51.994
Yeah, of you.

56:52.029 --> 56:55.688
You are wasting too touch time.

56:55.722 --> 56:57.068
You seem confused how to play.

56:58.276 --> 57:00.209
No one knows this
game better than me.

57:00.244 --> 57:02.177
Then tell me, how did
the channels get tangled?

57:02.211 --> 57:03.385
How?

57:03.489 --> 57:04.800
Ahhh?

57:06.733 --> 57:08.494
Double asymmetrical
focal points.

57:08.528 --> 57:08.735
A rare unstable configuration.

57:11.738 --> 57:13.257
Before you said
that's not uncommon.

57:13.291 --> 57:14.465
Now it's rare.

57:14.500 --> 57:15.673
What?

57:16.294 --> 57:17.434
No.

57:18.538 --> 57:20.816
Listen, we have to
follow out of here.

57:22.093 --> 57:24.026
And what about
your garble-mouth?

57:24.061 --> 57:25.821
There's something
you're not telling me.

57:25.856 --> 57:28.548
I am telling me we
need each other,

57:28.583 --> 57:31.551
to get out of this universe.

57:31.586 --> 57:33.933
First agree, we consult
all four players.

57:37.937 --> 57:38.731
Hey!

57:38.765 --> 57:39.801
Awww!

57:48.361 --> 57:50.018
All right, what did
you say he had now?

57:50.052 --> 57:51.019
A pink neck.

57:51.053 --> 57:51.364
Huh.

57:52.330 --> 57:53.780
I never seen a patient
like him before.

57:53.815 --> 57:54.850
All right, hold on.

57:56.749 --> 57:59.855
Code 2, this is Larry 381.

57:59.890 --> 58:03.272
Yeah, I got a male
mental 451, possible 211.

58:03.307 --> 58:06.068
Subject is medium build
with a pink neck.

58:08.381 --> 58:10.141
Copy that, I'll
send it out on the radio.

58:11.488 --> 58:12.730
Gonna be a long night.

58:12.765 --> 58:14.111
Hope they come soon.

58:14.801 --> 58:15.975
Oh boy.

58:30.334 --> 58:32.336
You're so pretty, you know that?

58:32.854 --> 58:34.511
Always like to tease me.

58:37.686 --> 58:39.861
Look, I'm available on Thursday.

58:41.034 --> 58:42.864
Would Thursday be good for you?

58:44.693 --> 58:47.247
Wow, that was some performance.

58:48.939 --> 58:50.630
You are quite the actress, Desa.

58:52.874 --> 58:54.289
Just
cooperate 100 percent.

58:57.395 --> 58:58.638
I could do you a favor.

58:59.570 --> 59:01.020
Yeah, what's that?

59:01.054 --> 59:02.918
Flash you out.

59:02.953 --> 59:04.126
Yeah.

59:05.645 --> 59:07.198
It's a wonderful experience.

59:07.233 --> 59:08.441
Really?

59:09.580 --> 59:10.961
This kind of wonderful?

59:16.622 --> 59:19.486
I read this story about a girl.

59:19.521 --> 59:21.765
A girl who thinks
she's dreaming.

59:21.799 --> 59:23.870
Except she wakes up
and she finds out

59:23.905 --> 59:26.666
that she's in reality.

59:26.701 --> 59:28.634
I was gonna get out
of this reality.

59:30.463 --> 59:31.775
Sorry, Desa.

59:32.672 --> 59:34.605
This is the real world.

59:34.640 --> 59:36.573
I'm not from this universe.

59:36.607 --> 59:37.608
See, now
you're lying, Desa.

59:37.643 --> 59:39.092
I'm not.

59:39.127 --> 59:39.921
And I hate liars!

59:42.958 --> 59:43.994
You fucking liar!

1:00:14.334 --> 1:00:15.957
Lleva!

1:00:15.991 --> 1:00:17.406
Jesus, finally someone
checks in with me.

1:00:17.441 --> 1:00:18.856
Are you at the hospital?

1:00:18.891 --> 1:00:21.238
I'm with a dangerous player.

1:00:21.272 --> 1:00:23.274
Pink neck. He violates the
rules of all realities.

1:00:23.309 --> 1:00:24.482
What?

1:00:25.656 --> 1:00:27.140
I need to get out of here.

1:00:27.175 --> 1:00:27.624
Wait, out of where?

1:00:28.555 --> 1:00:29.729
Tell me where you are, Lleva.

1:00:32.456 --> 1:00:34.803
It's simple.

1:00:34.838 --> 1:00:38.324
It is much better if we
de-align from this reality now.

1:00:38.358 --> 1:00:40.084
Not without my friends.

1:00:40.119 --> 1:00:41.672
Lleva!

1:00:41.707 --> 1:00:44.295
Where are you, kid?

1:00:45.227 --> 1:00:46.850
I can force you.

1:00:46.884 --> 1:00:48.127
They're only worms here.

1:00:49.162 --> 1:00:50.647
Get away, I'll scream.

1:00:51.786 --> 1:00:53.028
Let's talk this upper.

1:00:54.305 --> 1:00:56.238
After you give me back my phone.

1:00:56.273 --> 1:00:57.999
You don't me understand!

1:01:04.626 --> 1:01:06.248
I'm telling the real
truth this time.

1:01:50.361 --> 1:01:51.431
Can I help you?

1:01:53.744 --> 1:01:56.229
I don't know, can you?

1:01:57.644 --> 1:02:00.199
You know this is one big
massive security breach, right?

1:02:00.233 --> 1:02:02.822
Yeah, talk to your boss.

1:02:02.857 --> 1:02:04.721
Annette asked us to come.

1:02:05.618 --> 1:02:06.861
Why didn't you say that?

1:02:10.554 --> 1:02:11.589
Ahhh...

1:02:11.624 --> 1:02:13.108
What's your name?

1:02:15.421 --> 1:02:17.423
Wouldn't you like to know?

1:02:17.803 --> 1:02:19.459
I would actually.

1:02:19.736 --> 1:02:20.840
I like your jumpsuit.

1:02:23.325 --> 1:02:24.326
Thanks.

1:02:25.949 --> 1:02:27.813
I bet you'd look even
better without it.

1:02:29.573 --> 1:02:30.747
There we go.

1:02:31.817 --> 1:02:33.646
Yeah, that's better.

1:02:33.680 --> 1:02:34.785
It feels better.

1:02:36.304 --> 1:02:37.961
Is that a hard hat?

1:02:40.377 --> 1:02:42.793
Yeah, yeah, you wanna try it on?

1:02:42.828 --> 1:02:44.381
I like hard things.

1:02:44.415 --> 1:02:45.623
It's a little dirty.

1:02:45.658 --> 1:02:47.591
It's all right and it's ribbed.

1:02:51.043 --> 1:02:52.251
Be careful,
it might be tight.

1:02:53.217 --> 1:02:54.805
So what do you do here?

1:02:55.668 --> 1:02:56.842
I work inside.

1:02:58.084 --> 1:03:00.949
I see you have a
really big dish.

1:03:04.263 --> 1:03:05.920
Psionic pulse reference.

1:03:05.954 --> 1:03:08.405
Fifth continuum
parameter analog, okay?

1:03:08.439 --> 1:03:09.682
Elementary stuff.

1:03:09.716 --> 1:03:11.304
What is this about?

1:03:11.339 --> 1:03:12.823
The crystals, Frank.

1:03:13.928 --> 1:03:16.482
They contain electrons
imprisoned by molecular
lattices.

1:03:16.516 --> 1:03:18.760
Entangled across time-space
constraints by spin pairs.

1:03:18.795 --> 1:03:20.589
Myriads of 'em.

1:03:20.624 --> 1:03:23.213
It's a quantum
supercomputer but more.

1:03:23.247 --> 1:03:24.593
It's tremendous!

1:03:25.905 --> 1:03:28.114
You really do know about
this meter thing?

1:03:29.598 --> 1:03:30.876
It's a cross-dimensional
analysis meter,

1:03:30.910 --> 1:03:32.601
but not for InterMate.

1:03:32.636 --> 1:03:33.982
But, InterMate?

1:03:35.673 --> 1:03:37.330
A reality game but not
just mini-realities,

1:03:37.365 --> 1:03:40.057
extreme realities.

1:03:40.092 --> 1:03:41.783
It's from a kind of
super advanced game.

1:03:41.818 --> 1:03:43.612
Not a game, it's a new paradigm!

1:03:43.647 --> 1:03:45.373
Okay, let's forget
about paradigm.

1:03:45.407 --> 1:03:47.409
What about that guy who
dropped the device, who is he?

1:03:47.444 --> 1:03:49.446
Yeah, not just who, but where?

1:03:49.480 --> 1:03:51.034
You know who he is?

1:03:52.759 --> 1:03:54.175
No, no, stop her.

1:03:54.209 --> 1:03:55.935
I need to know how it's done,
the quantum engineering.

1:03:55.970 --> 1:03:56.867
I've answered all I can.

1:03:56.902 --> 1:03:57.903
I don't build this stuff.

1:03:57.937 --> 1:03:59.836
No, no, wait, wait, we need you.

1:04:02.424 --> 1:04:04.012
I thought you'd be able to help,

1:04:04.047 --> 1:04:05.496
that you'd be the
fourth player. - Wait.

1:04:06.946 --> 1:04:09.155
What can I do to
persuade you to stay?

1:04:10.156 --> 1:04:11.502
I'm sorry.

1:04:27.277 --> 1:04:28.865
This never happened
to me before.

1:04:29.693 --> 1:04:30.763
That's too bad.

1:04:31.937 --> 1:04:33.800
You deserve a little
perk of the job, right?

1:04:35.526 --> 1:04:38.736
So, maybe there's
somewhere better that we can go.

1:04:41.774 --> 1:04:42.879
I need the phone!

1:04:47.193 --> 1:04:48.608
It's not working.

1:04:48.643 --> 1:04:49.886
You gotta turn it on.

1:04:56.513 --> 1:04:57.721
Iastar, where are you?

1:04:57.755 --> 1:04:59.516
Your phone's been off.

1:04:59.550 --> 1:05:01.345
I've got to talk
to Lleva and Desa.

1:05:01.380 --> 1:05:02.415
Yeah, me too.

1:05:02.450 --> 1:05:04.210
Look, Lleva is messed up.

1:05:04.245 --> 1:05:06.247
She's on a date with some
lunatic with a pink neck.

1:05:06.661 --> 1:05:08.559
Pink neck?

1:05:08.594 --> 1:05:10.320
Yeah, said
he talks like you.

1:05:10.354 --> 1:05:13.219
He's violating reality rules.

1:05:13.254 --> 1:05:15.049
I don't know, she
sounded really panicked

1:05:15.083 --> 1:05:16.740
and then the call
just dropped out.

1:05:16.774 --> 1:05:18.500
It's that perv from the motel.

1:05:18.535 --> 1:05:21.089
It's his meter.

1:05:21.124 --> 1:05:23.920
A rogue player, no, not
a player, something else.

1:05:23.954 --> 1:05:25.852
He could short circuit the game.

1:05:25.887 --> 1:05:27.130
What? -  Where's Lleva?

1:05:28.062 --> 1:05:28.925
Ahhh!

1:05:30.029 --> 1:05:31.513
I know we're looking
for the same guy.

1:05:31.548 --> 1:05:32.825
I can help.

1:05:32.859 --> 1:05:35.690
Hold on, okay, one second.

1:05:35.724 --> 1:05:37.347
Let me pull this up.

1:05:37.381 --> 1:05:39.280
I was able to get
GPS on Lleva's last call,

1:05:39.314 --> 1:05:41.696
the Plaza Park Mall Arcade.

1:05:41.730 --> 1:05:43.111
Do you know where
Plaza Park Mall is?

1:05:43.146 --> 1:05:44.319
Yeah.

1:05:45.838 --> 1:05:48.151
Iastar, it's me
Nastya - Where the keys?

1:05:48.185 --> 1:05:50.153
Look, I need you.

1:05:50.187 --> 1:05:52.293
Karen and me, we're
called to frat party.

1:05:52.327 --> 1:05:54.019
My body can't take it more.

1:05:54.053 --> 1:05:55.986
I need for you doing flashouts.

1:05:56.021 --> 1:05:58.471
Okay, give me that.
Iastar, hold on.

1:05:58.506 --> 1:06:00.646
Listen, I was saving
this for something special but

1:06:01.647 --> 1:06:02.959
I just wanna tell you now.

1:06:04.546 --> 1:06:05.823
I'd like to make you a partner.

1:06:05.858 --> 1:06:08.171
So, I just need to come on back.

1:06:09.482 --> 1:06:12.727
I can't, Karen, but I
will always remember this.

1:06:12.761 --> 1:06:13.452
I'm concerned
for you, Iastar.

1:06:13.486 --> 1:06:14.487
Hello?

1:06:15.143 --> 1:06:16.144
Hello?

1:06:19.044 --> 1:06:20.597
Be careful doll.

1:06:23.531 --> 1:06:24.428
Where's the meter!

1:06:24.463 --> 1:06:25.567
What did you do?

1:06:25.602 --> 1:06:26.948
Hand it over to me! - Move, go!

1:06:26.983 --> 1:06:28.018
It's government property.

1:06:28.053 --> 1:06:28.985
It is mine!

1:06:29.606 --> 1:06:30.262
You bastard!

1:06:31.539 --> 1:06:33.265
Frank!

1:06:33.299 --> 1:06:34.645
Frank, Frank!

1:06:40.686 --> 1:06:42.308
Okay, so what happened to me?

1:06:42.343 --> 1:06:45.449
I hallucinated some
time-energy-space thing.

1:06:45.484 --> 1:06:47.279
It's an enhanced charge.

1:06:47.313 --> 1:06:48.728
I'm carrying the entropy
of two parallel universes,

1:06:48.763 --> 1:06:50.799
plus one mini universe.

1:06:50.834 --> 1:06:52.008
Can you just start
from the beginning?

1:06:52.042 --> 1:06:54.803
It's sort of
primitive from here.

1:06:54.838 --> 1:06:56.633
This guy, he's some
kind of outsider.

1:06:56.667 --> 1:06:58.876
He diverted us to this world.

1:06:58.911 --> 1:07:01.879
We were playing a four
player game, InterMate.

1:07:01.914 --> 1:07:04.917
He tried to flash me out to
short circuit the game reality.

1:07:04.951 --> 1:07:07.506
So, it's his reality game.

1:07:07.540 --> 1:07:09.646
No, ours, we ride small
short lived mini-realities.

1:07:09.680 --> 1:07:11.372
His game is much bigger.

1:07:11.406 --> 1:07:12.821
You saw the logo on his meter.

1:07:12.856 --> 1:07:14.789
The Mobius strip?

1:07:14.823 --> 1:07:16.170
The dimensional curve,
it's like a brand name,

1:07:16.204 --> 1:07:16.929
for the universe game.

1:07:16.963 --> 1:07:18.965
For all possible universes

1:07:19.000 --> 1:07:21.347
with everybody in
them, even you.

1:07:21.382 --> 1:07:22.900
And this guy, or whatever he is,

1:07:22.935 --> 1:07:24.902
manipulating the universe game,

1:07:24.937 --> 1:07:27.595
performing some deranged
reality experiment.

1:07:29.390 --> 1:07:30.736
At the Plaza Park Mall?

1:07:33.842 --> 1:07:35.327
All along,
one whole premise

1:07:35.361 --> 1:07:36.880
of my plan was screwed.

1:07:39.193 --> 1:07:42.610
It takes cooperation to
activate the flashout.

1:07:45.889 --> 1:07:48.650
Right then I felt
like letting her go.

1:07:48.685 --> 1:07:51.826
Let them control reality.

1:07:51.860 --> 1:07:54.070
Create it, destroy it,
choose their own.

1:07:56.762 --> 1:07:58.626
But I had my job.

1:08:00.006 --> 1:08:02.147
That's what makes us
civilized, right?

1:08:54.544 --> 1:08:56.649
Hey, she got a purse.

1:08:56.684 --> 1:08:58.168
So, dude, don't take the purse.

1:08:58.789 --> 1:09:00.066
You need a new purse, yo?

1:09:02.552 --> 1:09:03.587
What happened?

1:09:03.622 --> 1:09:06.003
You pass out on the pizza?

1:09:06.038 --> 1:09:08.005
She got maybe somethin'
better to do, fuckface.

1:09:19.810 --> 1:09:22.503
"Serial Killers", you
play with them, don't you?

1:09:22.537 --> 1:09:24.781
Play?

1:09:24.815 --> 1:09:27.818
No, I never do, I have a
holorecording to get to.

1:09:29.682 --> 1:09:30.683
Hey,

1:09:31.097 --> 1:09:32.237
I got a record.

1:09:32.271 --> 1:09:33.686
Wanna hear it?

1:09:33.721 --> 1:09:35.067
You fuckin' leave her alone.

1:09:36.206 --> 1:09:37.518
It's in here.

1:09:39.830 --> 1:09:40.935
I don't remember.

1:09:43.386 --> 1:09:44.939
Ahhhh!

1:09:51.704 --> 1:09:52.705
Dude, seriously?

1:09:57.193 --> 1:09:58.504
You gonna be okay?

1:10:00.644 --> 1:10:01.714
Let's eat.

1:10:19.974 --> 1:10:21.872
Can we get three
burgers, three fries.

1:10:21.907 --> 1:10:23.219
Make it five burgers.

1:10:25.324 --> 1:10:26.291
Three drinks.

1:11:46.543 --> 1:11:48.096
You have to believe me.

1:11:49.132 --> 1:11:50.306
The truth.

1:11:51.583 --> 1:11:53.205
I can get you out of this fix.

1:11:54.724 --> 1:11:57.347
I am a reality repairman.

1:11:58.900 --> 1:12:00.833
I am not normally in a
universe like this.

1:12:00.868 --> 1:12:04.354
I never go to your space
habitat universe.

1:12:04.389 --> 1:12:07.978
There is a much bigger game.

1:12:08.013 --> 1:12:11.706
I know I am routine maintenance
but it is an important job.

1:12:11.741 --> 1:12:14.744
Like the last universe,
routine mega-matrix,

1:12:17.022 --> 1:12:20.025
replacing a simple
field anomaly,

1:12:20.059 --> 1:12:23.200
next thing you know you
feel your baryons contract,

1:12:23.235 --> 1:12:26.859
the intervolic windows
turn black, your --

1:12:26.894 --> 1:12:28.965
You really believe all that?

1:12:33.107 --> 1:12:34.833
For real though, I just hope
he didn't spit in it this time.

1:12:34.867 --> 1:12:36.282
Yeah, I hope he did
more than that.

1:12:39.941 --> 1:12:40.977
Ready to get tweaked.

1:12:43.531 --> 1:12:45.291
I'm just kidding.

1:12:45.326 --> 1:12:46.292
Help yourself.

1:13:00.272 --> 1:13:03.309
I am sorry, Mom,
but we are alone.

1:13:04.725 --> 1:13:06.761
It's okay, these are my friends.

1:13:06.796 --> 1:13:08.763
Yeah, we're her friends.

1:13:08.798 --> 1:13:10.800
Yeah, tasty friend.

1:13:12.457 --> 1:13:14.355
We can not be divided.

1:13:14.390 --> 1:13:16.184
Well, aren't we rude?

1:13:16.219 --> 1:13:17.772
Lewd, did you say lewd?

1:13:17.807 --> 1:13:19.843
Are you an idiot?

1:13:19.878 --> 1:13:22.777
You can not take me
out of me doing my job.

1:13:22.812 --> 1:13:24.883
'ludes, you say you got 'ludes?

1:13:27.057 --> 1:13:30.613
Playing, think you are playing.

1:13:30.647 --> 1:13:32.960
None of this is important.

1:13:32.994 --> 1:13:35.445
I represent a being with
extraordinary powers.

1:13:36.929 --> 1:13:39.207
Alien, papers please.

1:13:40.139 --> 1:13:41.313
Yeah.

1:13:43.488 --> 1:13:44.661
Earthworms.

1:13:46.076 --> 1:13:48.769
If you persist in
interfacing with me. I--

1:13:48.803 --> 1:13:51.357
Fuck you, asshole.

1:13:51.392 --> 1:13:52.704
Fuck me? - Mm-hmm.

1:13:53.256 --> 1:13:54.430
Asshole?

1:14:00.263 --> 1:14:01.437
Out of my way.

1:14:11.481 --> 1:14:13.310
Whoa, whoa, hey, easy, boy.

1:14:21.318 --> 1:14:23.355
What the fuck is that?

1:14:23.389 --> 1:14:24.874
What is that shit, man?

1:14:30.983 --> 1:14:32.882
If Lleva's still with
him, she's not answering

1:14:32.916 --> 1:14:34.642
and who knows whether they're
still at the Plaza Park.

1:14:34.677 --> 1:14:35.850
Wait, is her phone
on your account?

1:14:35.885 --> 1:14:37.403
♪♪ Huh?

1:14:37.438 --> 1:14:38.819
We can use a mobile locator.
Here, give it to me.

1:14:40.441 --> 1:14:41.960
He couldn't be more dangerous.

1:14:41.994 --> 1:14:44.514
We're all created and
packaged by his game.

1:14:44.549 --> 1:14:46.343
I wish I had that
kind of control.

1:14:46.378 --> 1:14:49.036
Billions of universes,
infinite singularities.

1:14:49.070 --> 1:14:50.624
Billions and billions
of Big Bangs.

1:14:50.658 --> 1:14:52.971
We're inside one now.

1:14:53.005 --> 1:14:54.697
You know you speak
pretty fancy English

1:14:54.731 --> 1:14:56.561
for someone who's a space alien.

1:14:56.595 --> 1:14:58.563
My world exists right here.

1:14:58.597 --> 1:15:00.357
I'm human, like you. But from
a parallel, alternate present.

1:15:01.462 --> 1:15:03.982
Or don't you get it?

1:15:04.016 --> 1:15:07.295
You mean event horizons and
wormholes in hyperspace.

1:15:07.330 --> 1:15:11.437
So, you're human, just from
the other side of here.

1:15:11.472 --> 1:15:12.473
So you do get it.

1:15:13.716 --> 1:15:16.028
Oh, I'm getting her
GPS, it's not far from here.

1:15:23.829 --> 1:15:26.142
Dude had this powdery pink neck.

1:15:27.971 --> 1:15:29.145
Hold on.

1:15:30.974 --> 1:15:33.183
This is 3 Larry 81,
disturbance at the drive-in.

1:15:33.218 --> 1:15:34.806
Yeah, we got the wild
man from county.

1:15:34.840 --> 1:15:35.979
Suspect is on foot, over.

1:15:36.773 --> 1:15:38.637
Hey, you okay?

1:15:38.672 --> 1:15:40.121
God, that was weird.

1:15:51.719 --> 1:15:52.927
I wanted
to quit right there.

1:15:54.791 --> 1:15:57.276
It was the creeps, I tell you,

1:15:57.311 --> 1:15:58.623
and I was homesick too.

1:16:00.625 --> 1:16:01.660
You figure it out.

1:16:23.889 --> 1:16:26.202
You are going to let
me flash us out, now!

1:16:31.276 --> 1:16:32.967
It is time to make
this underwith.

1:16:34.486 --> 1:16:37.109
Or make sure you never
see another reality again.

1:16:51.537 --> 1:16:54.679
Mutual observed reality ritual.

1:16:54.713 --> 1:16:55.852
You know the technique!

1:17:27.056 --> 1:17:29.955
I finish my job one
way or another.

1:17:32.199 --> 1:17:33.441
Lleva!

1:17:33.476 --> 1:17:35.305
Do not interfere.

1:17:35.340 --> 1:17:37.687
It is not your four
player game anymore.

1:17:37.722 --> 1:17:39.965
You don't dare hurt her.

1:17:40.000 --> 1:17:42.243
You'll get stranded
here yourself.

1:17:42.278 --> 1:17:45.868
You have no way, no
way of knowing that.

1:17:45.902 --> 1:17:48.698
Get back, you'll
distort the process.

1:17:48.733 --> 1:17:49.941
It is a two player game.

1:17:50.493 --> 1:17:51.494
Ahhh!

1:17:53.254 --> 1:17:54.255
Ahhh!

1:18:07.096 --> 1:18:09.098
No, no, you'll
dislocate the real time!

1:18:40.646 --> 1:18:41.924
Oh yes!

1:18:42.787 --> 1:18:43.788
Ohh!

1:19:03.808 --> 1:19:04.809
Mmmm...

1:19:08.191 --> 1:19:09.917
Seems like years since
we did it that way.

1:19:10.780 --> 1:19:12.092
You feel what I'm feeling.

1:19:13.576 --> 1:19:14.715
Oh, I'm feeling it.

1:19:16.096 --> 1:19:17.753
You always get me there, Frank.

1:19:22.723 --> 1:19:23.862
But...

1:19:24.207 --> 1:19:25.553
But what?

1:19:27.624 --> 1:19:31.628
This time, I don't know, it
felt strangely different.

1:19:31.663 --> 1:19:32.871
Ouch.

1:19:32.906 --> 1:19:34.770
No, I mean, different, great.

1:19:34.804 --> 1:19:37.082
Like it was our first time.

1:19:37.980 --> 1:19:38.635
Frank.

1:19:38.670 --> 1:19:39.498
What?

1:19:40.499 --> 1:19:42.018
This was our first time.

1:19:43.882 --> 1:19:46.160
Okay, I'll play along.

1:19:46.195 --> 1:19:49.336
No, look, we were just there
on that hillside moments ago.

1:19:50.820 --> 1:19:53.305
The Earth universe, Frank.

1:19:53.340 --> 1:19:55.929
Angel's car, the RTA room.

1:19:55.963 --> 1:19:58.276
Metaphysics, really?

1:19:58.310 --> 1:20:00.105
We were always here.

1:20:00.140 --> 1:20:01.727
Yes, here.

1:20:05.939 --> 1:20:08.769
The RTA, the radio
telescope complex...

1:20:11.807 --> 1:20:14.292
Annette. You mean all
that, that was real?

1:20:14.326 --> 1:20:17.778
We were there and we
were always here too...

1:20:17.813 --> 1:20:20.298
this time. Our history's
been changed.

1:20:21.126 --> 1:20:22.024
And...

1:20:25.234 --> 1:20:27.167
seems we're not in the same
habitat I came from either.

1:20:28.996 --> 1:20:31.827
We're in a similar but
other parallel universe.

1:20:33.380 --> 1:20:34.899
Okay, now I'm clear.

1:20:36.314 --> 1:20:39.317
Our bizarre flashouts with
the wrong players, Frank,

1:20:39.351 --> 1:20:43.286
it twisted and overlaps
the space time geometry,

1:20:43.321 --> 1:20:45.841
creating two
simultaneous universes.

1:20:48.913 --> 1:20:50.984
Hi lovers,
we've got a call from Lleva.

1:20:52.778 --> 1:20:54.850
Hey kids, time for a
quick round of MetaMate?

1:20:56.092 --> 1:20:58.232
Found an awesome channel
for us, great reviews.

1:20:58.267 --> 1:20:59.647
Should be fun.

1:21:01.270 --> 1:21:03.444
We're in a whole other
version of our habitat world

1:21:03.479 --> 1:21:05.239
and this is no longer
a mini-reality game.

1:21:06.551 --> 1:21:08.898
Let's do it!

1:21:08.933 --> 1:21:11.659
All this tripping around.
Here, there, okay.

1:21:11.694 --> 1:21:13.489
I get it.

1:21:13.523 --> 1:21:15.940
Now we can enter all the
players from any one device.

1:21:15.974 --> 1:21:17.907
All set, kids, no prob'lies.

1:21:19.564 --> 1:21:22.601
Our newest four player
game crew together again.

1:21:22.636 --> 1:21:25.466
His game is ours now.

1:21:25.501 --> 1:21:27.227
And we control it.

1:21:29.229 --> 1:21:31.887
That perv, he wanted
to kill InterMate,

1:21:31.921 --> 1:21:34.303
and we beat him or it.

1:21:37.202 --> 1:21:40.136
Now we have access to
everywhere and everywhen.

1:21:40.171 --> 1:21:42.104
Thanks to one strange
deranged player.

1:21:45.486 --> 1:21:46.660
They're starting it up.

1:21:49.974 --> 1:21:51.665
It's actually
happening for real.

1:21:51.699 --> 1:21:54.461
Frank, you know what this means?

1:21:54.495 --> 1:21:58.051
We can now choose any
realities together!

1:21:58.085 --> 1:21:59.569
Any Earth we want, Frank.

1:21:59.604 --> 1:22:02.503
Any universe we want.

1:22:02.538 --> 1:22:04.747
All the space-times of
the grand multiverse!

1:22:09.303 --> 1:22:12.341
This universe is ending,
it really is, isn't it?

1:22:14.964 --> 1:22:16.932
There's plenty
more versions of it.

1:22:18.519 --> 1:22:19.693
I always liked this one.

1:22:24.698 --> 1:22:25.941
Let's do it.

1:23:09.812 --> 1:23:11.227
Really blew it.

1:23:11.262 --> 1:23:13.367
Screwed it up.

1:23:13.402 --> 1:23:15.991
I don't know what really
happened to those women.

1:23:16.025 --> 1:23:18.510
I don't know for sure

1:23:18.545 --> 1:23:22.066
but that was a long time ago.

1:23:36.666 --> 1:23:38.703
Shouldn't have any trouble
now with your televironment.

1:23:38.737 --> 1:23:40.049
But I'll tell you

1:23:40.084 --> 1:23:41.188
getting a hold of these
old parts ain't so easy.

1:23:42.569 --> 1:23:44.605
Yep, this set's
from the punk zone.

1:23:44.640 --> 1:23:46.400
Classic, like I used to be.

1:23:50.404 --> 1:23:53.614
If you get interrupted by
any of those weather shows,

1:23:53.649 --> 1:23:55.547
your set will switch
automatically

1:23:55.582 --> 1:23:57.101
to your favorite commercial.

1:23:58.792 --> 1:24:00.276
Call anytime you need me.

1:24:00.311 --> 1:24:01.346
You do plumbing?

1:24:28.442 --> 1:24:30.375
In a curious
way, I feel relieved.

1:24:31.652 --> 1:24:34.172
I feel, wasn't this
always reality?

1:24:37.141 --> 1:24:39.108
I've even given up
resuming my natural shape,

1:24:39.143 --> 1:24:40.316
too vulnerable.

1:24:41.593 --> 1:24:43.008
I wouldn't even want to.

1:24:45.839 --> 1:24:48.083
I must admit wondering
now and then,

1:24:48.117 --> 1:24:49.981
what happened to InterMate?

1:24:52.535 --> 1:24:54.330
Maybe it was destroyed,

1:24:54.365 --> 1:24:59.128
maybe there was some sort
of time warp, a side effect.

1:24:59.163 --> 1:25:03.753
Maybe some other repairman
has been sent to rescue me,

1:25:03.788 --> 1:25:07.999
and I only have to wait until
space-time comes full circle.

1:25:08.033 --> 1:25:11.036
But I no longer really care

1:25:12.417 --> 1:25:14.695
or remember all too well.

1:25:18.043 --> 1:25:20.218
Much of the Miami
Dade area is no more today,

1:25:20.253 --> 1:25:21.806
as vast areas of shoreland
have collapsed.

1:25:22.462 --> 1:25:25.050
Millions are--

1:25:25.085 --> 1:25:28.123
♪♪ Hi, I'm Desa, and

Biometrics tell you it's
been a hard day at work?

1:25:51.870 --> 1:25:54.114
Switch your projection wall

1:25:54.149 --> 1:25:57.669
and fall into the
hypnotizing gaze of NCG 1300.

1:25:58.360 --> 1:25:59.533

a celestial meteor shower.

1:26:04.366 --> 1:26:07.610
Or a romantic night
alone with your lover

1:26:07.645 --> 1:26:10.268
while Scorpious hovers above.

1:26:10.303 --> 1:26:12.857
This can all be yours
with an ever-rotating

1:26:12.891 --> 1:26:15.204
360 degree view.

1:26:17.482 --> 1:26:20.416

1:26:24.662 --> 1:26:26.871
from Earth's thermosphere.

1:26:26.905 --> 1:26:31.255
Now we can breathe a pure
ionized air with scents,

1:26:31.289 --> 1:26:34.810
ranging from Neo-Citrus,
Balinese Rainforest or...

1:26:36.984 --> 1:26:39.228
Mint Ocean, my favorite.

1:26:41.265 --> 1:26:44.682
Park Andromeda, your luxury
place in outer space.
