WEBVTT

00:10.218 --> 00:12.303
Are we sure I'm dead?
I feel like I wanna die.

00:12.387 --> 00:14.514
Well, your body's under a moose, so…

00:16.558 --> 00:18.476
Or maybe
I crossed over, and this is hell.

00:18.560 --> 00:20.353
How am I supposed to kiss Jake C now?

00:20.437 --> 00:22.522
The window is closed,
locked, and bricked over.

00:22.605 --> 00:25.608
You have to kiss him. This is
your unfinished business. Look at me.

00:25.692 --> 00:28.319
-This does not mean they're back together.
-It doesn't?

00:28.403 --> 00:31.156
No. Riley is the most manipulative human
on the planet.

00:31.239 --> 00:34.284
Of course she'd be getting
all up in Jake C. Hey, hey, hey!

00:34.367 --> 00:36.995
You need to put yourself in his position.
You were a no-show,

00:37.078 --> 00:39.539
so he's drowning his sorrows
in Riley's lips.

00:39.622 --> 00:41.374
-You are the jerk.
-I'm the jerk?

00:41.458 --> 00:44.127
You were supposed to show up at nine,
and it is midnight.

00:44.711 --> 00:47.255
-So, what am I supposed to do now?
-Apologize.

00:50.300 --> 00:51.301
Like, now?

00:51.926 --> 00:53.511
Mm… Yeah, I completely take that back.

00:53.595 --> 00:55.972
Okay, you need to really look at me.
Okay? And we need to go.

00:56.056 --> 00:59.976
Can you take the wheel? I would ask Jesus,
but I recently ate his face.

01:00.060 --> 01:01.019
Yeah. Yeah.

01:01.102 --> 01:02.479
-Okay.
-Yep. That's the right idea.

01:04.105 --> 01:06.983
It's just an apology.
How hard could it be?

01:07.067 --> 01:11.237
Hmm. Maybe I should put my<i> mea culpa</i>
in print.Yeah, that feels right.

01:11.321 --> 01:14.282
What? You gonna put a stamp on it,
wait for it to arrive in two to four days?

01:14.365 --> 01:17.202
Or were you thinking of sending it
with one of Brad's doves?

01:17.285 --> 01:19.454
When you break it down like that,
it does sound lame.

01:19.537 --> 01:21.831
Okay. What about a…
What about an apology text?

01:21.915 --> 01:22.916
Okay.

01:25.168 --> 01:26.002
Okay.

01:26.086 --> 01:29.756
Sorry I didn't make it to the kickback.
I was having an existential crisis

01:29.839 --> 01:32.425
and I needed urgent answers…
I don't know what to say.

01:32.509 --> 01:33.635
Well, not that.

01:33.718 --> 01:35.553
Okay. But I don't want to lie to him.

01:35.637 --> 01:37.764
So maybe I should just
speak from the heart.

01:37.847 --> 01:40.391
Which is not beating.
So what am I gonna do?

01:42.769 --> 01:44.145
Ooh. Delete. No.

01:47.690 --> 01:51.361
No. I threw up at the other party.
I'm gonna be the throw-up girl.

01:52.070 --> 01:54.864
Aagh. Screw it! I'm dead.
I'm just gonna say what I want.

01:54.948 --> 01:57.867
Sorry I didn't make it to the kickback.
Something weird happened. I won't…

01:57.951 --> 01:59.285
-Stop typing.
-It's boring.

01:59.369 --> 02:00.912
Actually it's not boring to me, but…

02:00.995 --> 02:04.249
-That's not gonna get you that kiss.
-No, it would just be weird.

02:04.332 --> 02:05.458
Anyways, I really…

02:05.542 --> 02:07.418
Anything over 15 words,
and you're my grandma

02:07.502 --> 02:08.837
giving me the recipe for lemonade.

02:08.920 --> 02:11.131
…borrowed one or gone
the T-shirt/underwear route.

02:11.923 --> 02:14.300
Bottom line is, I'm sorry.

02:14.384 --> 02:16.469
Do not send that!

02:16.553 --> 02:17.554
Okay, I won't send it.

02:17.637 --> 02:18.680
-I sent it.

02:18.763 --> 02:20.056
Oh.

02:37.240 --> 02:40.118
I can't believe how much time
I've wasted choosing outfits,

02:40.201 --> 02:43.955
showering, worrying about
the way that I looked. I look fine.

02:44.038 --> 02:47.375
No. You know, I look great,
and I don't need society to validate me.

02:47.458 --> 02:49.961
And I sure as hell
do not need Jake C to validate me.

02:51.421 --> 02:53.339
-Is it Jake?
-Gia!

02:53.423 --> 02:56.885
<i>Get your ass up, take a shower,</i>
<i>and get dressed. It's been a week.</i>

02:56.968 --> 03:00.263
Can't. I used up all my energy
to pick up this call, so what's the point?

03:00.346 --> 03:02.098
-I'm hanging up now.

03:02.182 --> 03:04.267
It's the Freshman 15, not the Senior 20.

03:04.350 --> 03:06.227
Leave me alone.
I'm streating with my daughter

03:06.311 --> 03:08.271
'cause Jake and Riley are firewalling us.

03:08.354 --> 03:09.772
-Streating?
-Stress eating.

03:09.856 --> 03:11.983
Because they haven't posted dick
on sosh meeds.

03:12.066 --> 03:14.235
No avocado toast. No double rainbow.

03:14.319 --> 03:16.154
Not even Frida Kahlo's face
in a cappuccino.

03:16.237 --> 03:18.364
They probably don't even
have their hands free.

03:21.034 --> 03:22.619
Jake C posted a pic of a tree.

03:23.661 --> 03:26.706
Let me see, let me see.
Well, that doesn't look like a local tree.

03:26.789 --> 03:30.084
They must be on a mini vacay,
all loved-up in an Airbnb.

03:30.168 --> 03:32.045
Reverse image Google map that shiz.

03:32.128 --> 03:34.672
-BBL. I have a date with monkey bread.

03:38.426 --> 03:40.178
Ah. What a twat.

03:40.261 --> 03:43.848
-You can't call women twats, you dick.
-Then don't call men dicks, asshole.

03:45.391 --> 03:47.727
I need all the monkey bread
to fill my empty soul.

03:47.810 --> 03:49.687
That's like 7,000 calories.

03:49.771 --> 03:51.522
-So.
-Your body won't let you eat that much.

03:51.606 --> 03:53.775
-You'll throw up or die.
-Wanna bet?

03:53.858 --> 03:56.819
Well, you're not the only one
who needs to eat their feelings.

03:59.239 --> 04:02.200
What's your problem? Why are you so clean?
Didn't you have a morning game?

04:02.283 --> 04:04.035
-I got dumped in the outfield.

04:04.118 --> 04:05.870
I'm a shortstop. So I quit.

04:05.954 --> 04:08.081
Dad! It's a sugar pine!

04:08.164 --> 04:10.291
Shit. They might be in Tahoe.

04:10.375 --> 04:12.961
Didn't you hear me? I quit baseball.

04:13.044 --> 04:16.172
Well, who cares about baseball?
Just do something else.

04:16.256 --> 04:18.007
But you said I was a natural.

04:18.091 --> 04:20.927
When you're dead,
and your body is rotting in a ditch,

04:21.010 --> 04:23.137
no one's gonna care
if you were shortstop or outfielder.

04:23.221 --> 04:25.098
Yeah. Says the mayor of Twat City.

04:25.181 --> 04:27.058
Hey. You're gonna miss me when I'm gone.

04:27.141 --> 04:30.478
-And it's gonna be sooner than you think.
-Yeah, not soon enough. 149 days.

04:30.561 --> 04:32.647
I wish I had 149 days.

04:32.730 --> 04:33.690
Shit.

04:34.565 --> 04:36.276
How many days do I have left?

04:37.318 --> 04:38.695
<i>Time frame?</i>

04:39.654 --> 04:41.906
Yeah, like how long do ghosts live?

04:41.990 --> 04:43.908
Or, you know, hang around?

04:43.992 --> 04:45.326
Hair of the dog.

04:45.410 --> 04:48.079
Or wolf. It symbolizes our wild instinct,

04:48.162 --> 04:49.580
which I gave into last night.

04:49.664 --> 04:51.582
I am so cold. Are you cold?

04:51.666 --> 04:53.626
If I knew it was gonna be
this frickin' freezing,

04:53.710 --> 04:55.837
I wouldn't have worn fishnets with holes.

04:57.797 --> 05:01.467
Anyway, time frame for a dead person
to remain a ghost depends on the UFB.

05:01.551 --> 05:03.428
As long as its business takes
to be finished.

05:03.511 --> 05:05.513
As long as the body isn't put to rest.

05:05.596 --> 05:07.515
-Like a funeral service?
-Or cremation?

05:07.598 --> 05:09.517
Yeah, funeral service, cremation.

05:09.600 --> 05:11.644
Whatever rite of passage floats your boat.

05:12.145 --> 05:14.856
Viking funeral pun intended!

05:14.939 --> 05:16.357
Unless…

05:16.441 --> 05:18.818
-Why do you always one-up me?
-You didn't give all the info.

05:18.901 --> 05:21.988
I agree with Magic Tyke,
like, once in a perigean full moon,

05:22.071 --> 05:24.032
but, in this case, he is right.

05:24.699 --> 05:25.992
Thank you, bitch.

05:27.035 --> 05:28.077
Unless?

05:28.161 --> 05:31.622
Unless the body decomposes
before its business is finished.

05:34.667 --> 05:36.169
And what happens to its ghost?

05:36.252 --> 05:38.463
If it doesn't finish
its unfinished business,

05:38.546 --> 05:41.424
it just sorta floats around
and lamely tries to haunt people.

05:41.507 --> 05:44.927
No one can see or hear them.
They're basically powerless, invisible.

05:45.011 --> 05:47.013
Directionless, stuck.

05:47.096 --> 05:48.723
Sucks BT.

05:48.806 --> 05:51.642
Gently pushing doors open
and making chandeliers flicker

05:51.726 --> 05:53.936
gets real boring… …real fast.

05:57.482 --> 06:00.943
And… and how long
does a ghost have to do that for?

06:01.027 --> 06:04.822
Forever. For eternity. And…
Yes, I'll follow you to hell!

06:04.906 --> 06:05.907
What?

06:05.990 --> 06:07.867
Not you. Her.

06:11.537 --> 06:13.581
-We're going to hell!

06:13.664 --> 06:15.833
-Oh, you're so beautiful.
-Look at you!

06:15.917 --> 06:17.794
-Oh, this is so comfy.

06:17.877 --> 06:20.838
<i>"I could have borrowed one</i>
<i>or gone the T-shirt/underwear route."</i>

06:20.922 --> 06:22.715
"Bottom line is, I'm sorry."

06:24.634 --> 06:27.637
So, is this an apology,
or is it a blow-off?

06:27.720 --> 06:30.473
Why do you even need to respond?
I thought you guys kissed and made up.

06:30.556 --> 06:32.975
We almost kissed. We just never got there.

06:33.059 --> 06:34.477
Well then, what's this?

06:36.145 --> 06:38.064
That was a mistake
in a drunken, vulnerable moment

06:38.147 --> 06:39.440
that you guys scared me into.

06:39.524 --> 06:42.527
Well, good! Keep following that instinct.

06:42.610 --> 06:47.073
Anyway, I wasn't even talking about Riley.
I was talking about… Erika.

06:47.156 --> 06:49.784
-Oh! Beer pong girl.
-Yeah. I love that girl. She's supes hot.

06:49.867 --> 06:52.829
Exactly. She's chill and cool and awesome.

06:52.912 --> 06:54.414
And I think I may have blown it

06:54.497 --> 06:56.207
because I waited too long
to text her back.

06:56.290 --> 06:59.585
Why are you texting Erika when you
and Riley are already back together?

06:59.669 --> 07:01.087
And BT-doubles,

07:02.463 --> 07:03.881
my promposal is tonight.

07:03.965 --> 07:05.091
-Okay.

07:05.174 --> 07:08.261
Don't show up to the park
without knowing your move.

07:08.344 --> 07:09.554
Wait. Okay.

07:09.637 --> 07:11.764
Hey.

07:12.348 --> 07:14.350
Can you guys just,
like, for a second stop it?

07:15.017 --> 07:17.103
Okay, I'm not back together with Riley.

07:19.063 --> 07:21.399
So, what, you're going to prom as friends?

07:21.482 --> 07:24.652
Hey, with or without benefits,
it's 30 bucks for the sex room.

07:24.735 --> 07:26.821
-Sixty for the non-sex.
-Why's the sex room cheaper?

07:26.904 --> 07:30.366
We're splitting the cost between eight.
Don't worry, it's a classy setup.

07:31.117 --> 07:33.411
-Riley will love it.
-Riley and I are broken up.

07:34.078 --> 07:36.622
Dude, if you don't take Riley,

07:37.248 --> 07:39.417
you will ruin prom for everyone.

07:39.500 --> 07:41.586
See, that… that is just bullshit.

07:41.669 --> 07:44.464
And you know what?
I'm taking whoever I want.

07:46.507 --> 07:47.967
Unless she blew me off.

07:49.427 --> 07:52.472
I have two choices. Kiss Jake C
while he still has interest and ascend,

07:52.555 --> 07:56.142
or become an apparition and spend
eternity as Helen Who in a lava lamp.

07:56.225 --> 07:57.727
That is a no-brainer.

07:58.478 --> 08:01.272
Unless that wasn't just a kiss
and they're already back together.

08:01.355 --> 08:02.356
Who cares?

08:02.440 --> 08:04.984
Home-wrecking? No. That's bad karma
and a one-way ticket to hell.

08:05.067 --> 08:07.069
No one's gonna damn you
for one make-out sesh.

08:07.153 --> 08:09.238
You don't know
if Jake C and Riley got back together.

08:09.322 --> 08:11.240
If you kiss him before you find out,

08:11.324 --> 08:13.201
I believe plausible deniability
still applies.

08:13.284 --> 08:15.661
It has to.
I have a very short attention span.

08:15.745 --> 08:17.997
I can't spend the rest of eternity bored.
I will die.

08:18.080 --> 08:19.916
I mean… You know what I mean.

08:19.999 --> 08:21.667
I gotta kiss Jake C, like, now.

08:22.543 --> 08:23.419
Get it.

08:50.821 --> 08:53.032
I realized, once I do this,
I'm never gonna see you again.

08:53.115 --> 08:55.451
I cannot leave this earth
without telling you how much you--

09:02.917 --> 09:05.294
-What the hell is happening?
-You are happening.

09:05.378 --> 09:07.547
You need to rein in
your paranormal activity.

09:07.630 --> 09:08.589
Okay. How do I do that?

09:15.263 --> 09:18.808
-Promposals are so dumb.
-That's not what you said last week.

09:18.891 --> 09:20.184
Well, I'm saying it now.

09:21.644 --> 09:23.271
Not all promposals.

09:23.354 --> 09:26.232
I'm sure Jake M's is gonna be so cute.

09:26.315 --> 09:28.693
All I'm saying is, they're not for me.

09:29.193 --> 09:32.697
Like, to me, the best ask is no ask,
like JC and me.

09:32.780 --> 09:35.533
We're so on the same page,
we don't even need to officiate it.

09:35.616 --> 09:38.786
Which is why, when he shows up
on the day, wearing a white tux,

09:38.869 --> 09:42.665
standing up in the sunroof of a black,
high-end SUV, holding chrysanthemums,

09:42.748 --> 09:45.793
I will be camera-ready
in my midnight blue strapless gown

09:45.876 --> 09:47.211
and silver shoes.

09:47.295 --> 09:51.591
Going back to the same page theory,
you might wanna turn that page.

09:52.383 --> 09:53.968
Jake M is having a freak-out,

09:54.051 --> 09:57.597
because Jake C might kind of,
sort of, possibly, totally, definitely

09:57.680 --> 10:00.016
wanna take Erika instead of you. Maybe.

10:01.809 --> 10:02.643
You okay?

10:02.727 --> 10:04.312
I'm always okay.

10:04.395 --> 10:05.396
Mm-hmm.

10:05.479 --> 10:07.565
Well, Jake M wants to know
what you're gonna do.

10:07.648 --> 10:10.276
-What should I text him?
-Dog in sunglasses.

10:10.818 --> 10:12.987
-Erika, do something!

10:13.070 --> 10:15.573
Is someone actually calling me,
or is that me calling me?

10:19.910 --> 10:22.580
Holy shit! Holy shit!
You just neutralized your energy.

10:22.663 --> 10:24.123
You gotta keep those in all the time.

10:24.206 --> 10:27.168
I'm not wearing them for the rest
of my non-life life. It's so not sexy.

10:27.251 --> 10:29.086
-Well, that's even less sexy.

10:37.261 --> 10:39.764
After I kiss Jake C, I'm gonna ascend,

10:39.847 --> 10:42.516
and you and I
will never see each other again.

10:42.600 --> 10:43.434
So…

10:45.436 --> 10:46.854
I guess this is goodbye.

10:48.230 --> 10:51.025
I love you so much.

10:51.942 --> 10:53.653
I love you too.

10:55.905 --> 10:58.449
I would have never
survived high school without you.

10:58.532 --> 11:01.327
And I never would have survived life
without you.

11:02.161 --> 11:05.331
You know, besides my mom,
you really are my only family.

11:05.414 --> 11:07.333
I have to delay this kiss.

11:07.416 --> 11:10.586
I have to say goodbye to my family
and tie things up.

11:12.463 --> 11:15.091
Am I texting myself now?
God, I'm so needy.

11:16.717 --> 11:20.096
It's a group invite
to Jake M's promposal at nine tonight.

11:20.179 --> 11:21.138
Who sent it?

11:21.222 --> 11:23.641
I don't recognize any of the numbers
but Jake C's.

11:23.724 --> 11:26.811
Jake C invited me to a promposal.

11:26.894 --> 11:28.896
-That's when you kiss him!
-Oh my God.

11:28.979 --> 11:31.774
Okay. So I have till 9:00 p.m. tonight
to lock shit up,

11:31.857 --> 11:34.151
say my goodbyes
and get my things in order.

11:34.235 --> 11:35.778
This is it, G.

11:35.861 --> 11:38.322
TTDBIKJAD.

11:39.240 --> 11:42.660
Oliver, before I go,
I want you to remember three things.

11:42.743 --> 11:44.704
Don't quit baseball, okay?

11:44.787 --> 11:47.331
You will regret it.
You are a natural at it.

11:47.415 --> 11:49.750
Two, ask Dad to get your ears pinned.

11:49.834 --> 11:51.210
And three.

11:52.002 --> 11:53.671
-I love you.

11:55.214 --> 11:57.049
-Hey, Dad. I just wanted to…

11:57.133 --> 11:58.300
Is it about Jake?

11:59.051 --> 12:00.678
I'll come back after work.

12:02.680 --> 12:04.432
And I would always feel so special

12:04.515 --> 12:06.600
when you'd call in sick
to take me to Disneyland.

12:06.684 --> 12:09.270
And I don't know what I'm gonna do
without you when I'm gone.

12:11.439 --> 12:13.107
When I go away to college.

12:14.150 --> 12:15.776
I love you, Mom.

12:15.860 --> 12:17.945
I love you too, honey.

12:21.949 --> 12:24.493
Wish I had that relationship
with my daughter.

12:24.577 --> 12:26.912
But my Sarah, she's an asshole.

12:28.122 --> 12:29.999
Goodbye, eighth grade diary.

12:30.082 --> 12:31.584
GROAIE.

12:34.837 --> 12:36.005
Goodbye, Helen Who.

12:38.841 --> 12:41.051
Goodbye, driver's license
with the hideous pic.

12:42.052 --> 12:45.931
Wait. That was you who farted
in third grade? I thought it was Devon.

12:46.515 --> 12:50.436
Yeah, forgot about that.
But, yes, I was the culprit.

12:50.519 --> 12:53.355
-You know everyone still calls him Stinky?
-Yeah.

12:53.939 --> 12:56.776
That's bad karma.
I gotta apologize to Devon.

12:56.859 --> 12:58.235
Whoa, no. No, we don't have time.

12:58.319 --> 12:59.403
I'm almost done.

12:59.487 --> 13:02.072
I just have to say goodbye to my dad
before we hit the promposal.

13:02.156 --> 13:06.035
It takes two seconds to say I'm sorry.
I can say it in one. I'm sorry!

13:06.118 --> 13:06.994
You.

13:08.329 --> 13:11.290
-You ruined my life.
-I just farted, and I didn't claim it.

13:11.373 --> 13:14.418
That fart changed the course
of my destiny.

13:14.502 --> 13:18.088
Up until a month ago,
I was known to the world as Stinky.

13:18.172 --> 13:21.050
When someone finally called me Devon,

13:21.133 --> 13:22.134
I wept.

13:22.218 --> 13:25.596
Do you have any idea what it's like
to have your identity co-opted?

13:25.679 --> 13:27.765
I do, actually, and I am so sorry.

13:27.848 --> 13:31.560
Let me tell you a story
about Devon Evan Kaler,

13:31.644 --> 13:34.772
and his fall from grace.

13:36.607 --> 13:40.569
After that, uh…
fateful day in third grade,

13:41.362 --> 13:45.407
that nickname stuck to me
like flies on shit.

13:45.491 --> 13:47.159
Touché!

13:49.411 --> 13:51.413
I did everything to get that stink off.

13:51.497 --> 13:55.292
I… I quit the soccer team,
even though I was a prodigy,

13:55.376 --> 13:58.254
because I was too afraid to sweat
and get BO.

13:58.337 --> 14:03.008
I haven't eaten broccoli or eggs
in ten years.

14:03.092 --> 14:04.927
I shower six times a day,

14:05.010 --> 14:07.680
and my skin has been scrubbed so raw,

14:08.848 --> 14:10.182
I have eczema.

14:12.977 --> 14:15.521
If it's any consolation,
I think you smell amazing.

14:15.604 --> 14:16.730
It's not.

14:18.107 --> 14:19.775
You know, I'll never be able to forgive.

14:20.734 --> 14:21.652
Or forget.

14:22.236 --> 14:25.489
So in freshman year,
people started calling me Helen Who--

14:25.573 --> 14:28.909
Yeah, I'd give my right nut
to be Helen Who.

14:30.369 --> 14:32.788
-If I had one.
-Is that my fault too?

14:32.872 --> 14:34.373
No. I was born that way.

14:37.543 --> 14:38.794
So long, Erika.

14:40.629 --> 14:42.840
Oh, and here's something
you'll never forget.

14:43.674 --> 14:45.009
Karma's a bitch.

14:46.886 --> 14:50.180
We have a problem. The promposal
starts at eight-thirty, not nine.

14:50.264 --> 14:53.267
It was on the sub-chain. Everybody has to
get there early. It's a surprise.

14:53.350 --> 14:54.310
It's okay. Don't stress.

14:54.393 --> 14:57.229
It still gives us two hours to say bye
to your dad and get mochaccinos.

14:57.313 --> 14:59.690
That's not it. I ruined Devon's life.
I have to make it right.

14:59.773 --> 15:01.692
But you confessed. You're absolved.

15:01.775 --> 15:04.361
I, of all people,
understand how one little incident

15:04.445 --> 15:05.988
can change the course of someone's life.

15:06.071 --> 15:07.781
I cannot move on until I fix Devon's.

15:07.865 --> 15:10.784
If you're in my shoes, would you do
all you could to set someone up to win?

15:11.577 --> 15:12.828
Yeah. I would.

15:13.495 --> 15:15.080
Is this Cara Bishop?

15:15.164 --> 15:19.001
This is Erika Vu from third grade.
I have a confession to make.

15:19.084 --> 15:22.296
Do you remember when Devon farted,
and everyone started calling him Stinky?

15:22.379 --> 15:25.466
Well, that fart was mine.
Mason? Hi, this is Erika Vu.

15:28.218 --> 15:29.887
Erika Vu from third grade.

15:29.970 --> 15:33.432
Do you remember when Devon farted,
and everyone started to call him Stinky?

15:33.515 --> 15:34.767
Well, that fart was mine.

15:34.850 --> 15:36.101
Well, that fart was mine.

15:36.185 --> 15:39.730
I'm not currently calling you
to tell you I'm currently farting.

15:43.400 --> 15:44.652
-Done.
-Whoo!

15:44.735 --> 15:46.028
Let's go.

15:46.111 --> 15:48.864
You're an amazing dad and a great friend.
I'm gonna miss our chess games

15:48.948 --> 15:51.200
where we both cheated
when the other went to the bathroom.

15:51.283 --> 15:54.495
And our karaoke afternoons when Mom
and Oliver would try and pay us to stop,

15:54.578 --> 15:57.706
and we'd place bets on how long
it would take them to leave the house.

15:57.790 --> 16:01.251
And most of all, I'm gonna miss our talks
over our secret stash of junk food

16:01.335 --> 16:02.544
that only we knew about.

16:03.545 --> 16:07.216
I love you, Dad.
I just wanted you to know before I leave.

16:08.050 --> 16:09.051
For college.

16:10.010 --> 16:12.012
My only regret
is we never got high together.

16:15.224 --> 16:17.059
No time like the present.

16:20.980 --> 16:23.107
Hi, dead body!

16:23.190 --> 16:25.401
I forgive you, Shelly!

16:25.484 --> 16:27.695
-Now, who the hell is Shelly?
-The moose.

16:27.778 --> 16:29.863
-Are you high?
-A little bit.

16:29.947 --> 16:30.990
And you're driving?

16:31.073 --> 16:32.866
A lot a bit. I'm also dead.
It doesn't matter.

16:32.950 --> 16:34.618
Uh, maybe I don't wanna die.

16:46.880 --> 16:48.090
Let's do this.

16:48.841 --> 16:51.593
Wait, what am I doing? What's the plan?

16:51.677 --> 16:54.263
Do I immediately grab Jake C and kiss him,
or do I wait till after?

16:55.222 --> 16:57.558
What if there's not an after-promposal?

16:57.641 --> 17:00.394
Huh. Or what if there is,
and Riley's there and she's watching?

17:00.477 --> 17:04.440
You're gonna pull him aside
somewhere private after Jake M promposes.

17:04.523 --> 17:06.483
You're a part of the event.
You should enjoy it.

17:07.192 --> 17:08.027
Okay.

17:08.110 --> 17:08.986
Hey.

17:09.069 --> 17:12.197
I think this is where we part ways.
You don't need me for the kissing part.

17:12.281 --> 17:15.242
Objectively speaking, it's weird and gross
watching people make out.

17:16.076 --> 17:18.412
I… I… I can't say goodbye again,

17:18.495 --> 17:20.289
because it's really painful. Um…

17:20.372 --> 17:23.959
And if you're gonna ascend after the kiss,
then let's do Irish goodbyes.

17:24.668 --> 17:26.879
We already had our master cry
in the school bathroom, so…

17:27.671 --> 17:29.173
You know that I love you.

17:29.923 --> 17:32.134
And I know you love me, so…

17:33.927 --> 17:36.930
-Bye.
-But…

17:39.516 --> 17:40.559
-Bye.
-Bye.

17:41.185 --> 17:42.144
Have fun.

17:55.407 --> 17:57.159
Now go kiss that boy!

18:03.248 --> 18:05.959
-Whoa, whoa! Don't touch the chair.

18:06.043 --> 18:08.128
Dude, I'm just taking a photo. Jeez.

18:08.212 --> 18:10.380
Words on the front, Archer!

18:17.471 --> 18:18.430
Hey.

18:20.224 --> 18:22.226
You're at the end of the question.

18:22.309 --> 18:24.144
"Lea, will you go to prom with me?"

18:24.937 --> 18:27.898
-Oh, cool.
-No, it's dumb, but Lea will love it.

18:28.941 --> 18:31.443
-Can we chat?
-Um, okay.

18:32.945 --> 18:35.697
Look, I know we've had a thorny past, but

18:36.907 --> 18:39.409
I was hoping we could
put that behind us and be friends.

18:39.493 --> 18:42.246
I know that must sound like total BS
coming from me,

18:42.329 --> 18:45.916
but high school's almost over, and life is
too short to be holding grudges.

18:46.792 --> 18:50.879
Way too short. I couldn't agree more.
Do you really wanna be friends?

18:50.963 --> 18:54.925
-That's why I invited you here.
-Oh, you invited me. Um…

18:55.551 --> 18:58.512
There couldn't be a more perfect time
to make peace with each other, so…

18:58.595 --> 19:00.472
-Yay! Great. Friends!
-Yeah.

19:00.556 --> 19:01.723
Oh shit.

19:02.266 --> 19:04.184
Okay. Everyone line up.

19:04.268 --> 19:05.894
Lea is almost here.

19:05.978 --> 19:10.649
And remember. When it gets
to the turn, drop, booty shake,

19:10.732 --> 19:12.151
we should be facing…

19:13.235 --> 19:15.571
Each other. Each other.

19:40.846 --> 19:42.973
Ooh. Erika, tiny little FYI.

19:43.056 --> 19:45.976
Now that we're friends,
I'm gonna let you in on the friend code.

19:46.059 --> 19:47.978
We don't date each other's exes.

19:48.061 --> 19:50.939
As in, you can't go to prom with Jake C.

19:51.023 --> 19:53.859
No problem at all.
I didn't even wanna go to prom.

19:53.942 --> 19:56.069
In fact, you and Jake C
should go together.

19:56.153 --> 19:56.987
Oh, great.

19:58.363 --> 19:59.489
And pose.

20:03.744 --> 20:04.828
Can I talk to you?

20:05.954 --> 20:07.289
Guys, get back in line!

20:09.374 --> 20:11.835
"Lea, will you GoPro with me?"

20:11.919 --> 20:15.923
Why are you asking me…
…about a GoPro?

20:16.006 --> 20:17.382
No, no. This was your promposal.

20:18.008 --> 20:19.885
A fountain.

20:19.968 --> 20:22.721
Could there be a more perfect place
for a first kiss? I think not.

20:22.804 --> 20:25.515
What? No. There's no kissing here.

20:25.599 --> 20:26.516
There isn't?

20:26.600 --> 20:28.310
No. No, there's only talking.

20:28.393 --> 20:31.271
And you… You don't get to decide
who I go to prom with.

20:31.355 --> 20:32.898
Only I get to decide that.

20:32.981 --> 20:36.235
And, you know what? I decided
that I was going to ask you to prom.

20:36.818 --> 20:38.779
Or I did,
before you tried to decide for me.

20:38.862 --> 20:42.282
I'm sorry. I wasn't trying
to make that decision for you. Um…

20:42.866 --> 20:45.661
Just…
I don't really care about prom.

20:45.744 --> 20:50.207
And I'm gonna be OOT anyway.
And TBBH, I think prom is lame

20:50.290 --> 20:53.627
and just a stupid cliché
that originated in debutante circles,

20:53.710 --> 20:57.506
which were racist,
sexist, and exclusionary.

20:58.507 --> 21:01.301
Uh… Oh. Okay. Um…

21:02.010 --> 21:03.512
I didn't know that. Uh…

21:04.012 --> 21:06.265
But you're gonna be out of town.
Where are you going?

21:06.348 --> 21:08.517
That is a great question.

21:08.600 --> 21:10.852
Uh, destination TBD.

21:10.936 --> 21:13.355
Now I have a question for you.
Do you wanna make out?

21:14.147 --> 21:15.023
No.

21:16.149 --> 21:17.067
Why not?

21:17.567 --> 21:20.153
Because you want to make out with me,

21:20.237 --> 21:22.364
but you also want me
to ask my ex-girlfriend to prom.

21:22.447 --> 21:26.285
You approach me at school, then run away.
You're very confusing to me.

21:27.995 --> 21:31.707
I'm just gonna lay it all out on the table
because I literally have nothing to lose.

21:32.499 --> 21:35.877
I will never forget the first day
that I met you at freshman orientation.

21:35.961 --> 21:39.923
I've just had like the biggest crush
on you for the past four years.

21:40.007 --> 21:42.134
And then, when we finally connected
at Jake W's party,

21:42.217 --> 21:46.888
I couldn't believe how kind you were,
and sweet and funny and amazing.

21:46.972 --> 21:49.016
And I thought that
maybe you were on Ecstasy,

21:49.099 --> 21:52.436
but I checked your pupils,
and they were not dilated, and I…

21:53.562 --> 21:55.063
I was dying to kiss you.

21:56.773 --> 21:57.941
Well, uh,

21:59.359 --> 22:00.861
you can kiss me now.

22:05.449 --> 22:07.284
What's wrong?

22:08.577 --> 22:11.413
I'm just trying to savor
the before-the-first-kiss moment.

22:11.496 --> 22:13.999
You can never have that back,
and I'm really gonna miss that.

22:14.082 --> 22:16.835
In fact, I'm really gonna miss
a lot of the before-the-first things

22:16.918 --> 22:20.047
that I'm never gonna experience
for the first time, or

22:20.756 --> 22:21.590
ever.

22:22.841 --> 22:23.675
Ever?

22:23.759 --> 22:26.386
Sorry.
I know I'm acting weird. Um…

22:27.054 --> 22:29.473
It's just, I don't know
what's gonna happen after we kiss,

22:29.556 --> 22:31.516
so just be open to anything.

22:32.893 --> 22:35.062
I don't understand at all
what you're even--

22:48.492 --> 22:49.409
Do you still see me?

22:50.911 --> 22:52.204
Of course I see you.

23:05.801 --> 23:06.927
Oh my God.

23:08.428 --> 23:09.388
Nothing's happening.

23:09.471 --> 23:12.599
Uhh, you know, something's
definitely happening.

23:12.682 --> 23:15.060
But why am I still here?
