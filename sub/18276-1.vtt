00:51.000 --> 00:54.000
Today, the city
of Vukovar has fallen.

00:54.035 --> 00:55.965
It is now no more than rubble.

00:56.000 --> 01:00.000
In the past two months,
the Serbs have pounded it

01:00.035 --> 01:01.965
with more than two million shells.

01:02.000 --> 01:04.000
These survivors
are heading for Bosnia,

01:04.035 --> 01:05.965
hoping to escape the war.

01:06.000 --> 01:09.000
But tonight
we must face the possibility

01:09.035 --> 01:11.017
that this... is only the beginning.

01:11.052 --> 01:13.000
# We strolled through the hills

01:13.035 --> 01:15.000
# All wet with rain

01:16.000 --> 01:18.500
# And back along the lane again

01:18.535 --> 01:21.000
# There with the sun shining

01:22.000 --> 01:24.000
# In the sweet summertime

01:26.000 --> 01:33.000
# The way that young lovers do

01:36.000 --> 01:39.000
# I kissed you on the lips once more

01:39.035 --> 01:40.965
# And we said goodbye

01:41.000 --> 01:45.000
# At your front door
in the night time

01:45.035 --> 01:48.000
# Yeah, that's the right time

01:49.000 --> 01:50.965
# To feel the way

01:51.000 --> 01:56.000
# That young lovers do

01:59.000 --> 02:00.965
# Then we sat on our own star

02:01.000 --> 02:04.000
# And dreamed
of the way that we were... #

02:10.000 --> 02:13.000
# Then we sat on... #

02:14.000 --> 02:15.000
Oh...

03:01.000 --> 03:02.965
# Then we sat on our own star

03:03.000 --> 03:07.000
# And dreamed
of the way that we were

03:07.035 --> 03:11.000
# And the way that we wanted to be

03:12.000 --> 03:13.965
# Then we sat on our own star

03:14.000 --> 03:18.000
# And dreamed
of the way that I was for you

03:18.035 --> 03:21.000
# And you were for me

03:23.000 --> 03:27.000
# I would like to
dance the night away... #

03:52.000 --> 03:54.000
- Get the cross.
- I've got it.

03:56.000 --> 03:58.000
Oh, Christ! Go back. Go back.

03:58.035 --> 04:00.000
Go back.

04:01.000 --> 04:03.000
Get the sniper!

04:09.000 --> 04:12.000
Yeah, yeah, I got him.

04:12.035 --> 04:13.000
Get the priest.

04:13.035 --> 04:15.000
Is he mad?

04:22.000 --> 04:23.000
Is he mad?

04:26.000 --> 04:26.965
Come on.

04:27.000 --> 04:29.000
- You don't want this?
- Come on!

05:03.000 --> 05:05.000
This is the wrong street.

05:18.000 --> 05:20.000
Let's go back.

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
- Michael, let's go back.
- It's here.

05:29.000 --> 05:30.000
Shit!

05:42.000 --> 05:45.000
They put roadblocks.
I turned the van round.

05:45.035 --> 05:48.000
Others are going to be
stuck here for hours.

05:51.000 --> 05:53.000
Easy!

06:01.000 --> 06:04.965
- What did you get?
- We need a new driver.

06:05.000 --> 06:10.000
It was hard to get Joey. He was
a cabbie. He knows the city.

06:10.035 --> 06:11.965
He's an idiot.

06:12.000 --> 06:14.965
He's been selling our petrol.
AND he's an idiot.

06:15.000 --> 06:19.000
We've been running round the
streets trying to find him.

06:19.035 --> 06:21.965
Is that true about the petrol?

06:22.000 --> 06:25.000
It was full this morning
and it's empty now.

06:27.000 --> 06:29.000
That's it. From there.

06:29.035 --> 06:31.000
Now, another three.

06:32.000 --> 06:35.000
No one dares move the body.

06:35.035 --> 06:35.965
Then the boy.

06:36.000 --> 06:38.965
- This now.
- No, the boy.

06:39.000 --> 06:43.000
I just saw this footage
of Flynn being shot at.

06:43.035 --> 06:44.965
- Got that?
- No.

06:45.000 --> 06:47.000
- Why not?
- Why not what?

06:47.035 --> 06:49.965
Why haven't we got it?

06:50.000 --> 06:51.965
General decline
in journalistic standards.

06:52.000 --> 06:56.000
It's this news as entertainment
bollocks. So patronising.

06:56.035 --> 06:59.000
- I hate that.
- I hate that, too.

06:59.035 --> 06:59.965
Jane?

07:00.000 --> 07:02.500
I actually think it was very brave,

07:02.535 --> 07:05.000
and most people respond to bravery.

07:05.035 --> 07:07.000
Ooh!

07:09.000 --> 07:11.965
'They were
yards from the church

07:12.000 --> 07:16.000
'when the sniper opened fire,
and now the mother is dead.

07:16.035 --> 07:18.000
'Another innocent victim
killed in cold blood.

07:18.035 --> 07:19.965
'This is Jordan Flynn in Sarajevo. '

07:20.000 --> 07:26.000
I'm not worthy of
applause, but I'll take money.

07:26.035 --> 07:28.000
Oh, thank you.
You'll be remembered.

07:28.035 --> 07:29.965
Thank you so much.

07:30.000 --> 07:32.500
Oh-ho! Well, look
who's here - Henderson.

07:32.535 --> 07:35.000
And Gregg.
Care to make a contribution?

07:35.035 --> 07:37.965
I don't have anything small enough.

07:38.000 --> 07:41.000
Sure you do,
but I was thinking about money.

07:41.035 --> 07:43.965
- What d'you think? Syndicated worldwide.
- Your producers must be delighted

07:44.000 --> 07:49.000
- Exactly.
- They sent you to get killed.

07:49.035 --> 07:51.017
Now it looks like you will.

07:51.052 --> 07:52.965
- Good one!
- Good night.

07:53.000 --> 07:55.000
Henderson, how about
a little Bushmills?

07:55.035 --> 07:57.000
Hey, Gregg - Bushmills.

07:57.035 --> 07:58.965
See ya.

07:59.000 --> 08:02.000
I can't believe
you're turning down Bushmills.

08:02.035 --> 08:04.000
There's a first.

08:07.000 --> 08:10.000
He was only trying to help.

08:10.035 --> 08:12.000
We're here to report.

08:12.035 --> 08:12.965
Yeah.

08:13.000 --> 08:17.000
Haven't seen Bushmills
in a long time.

08:17.035 --> 08:19.000
Michael, are you all right?

08:20.000 --> 08:23.000
- Michael, are you all right?
- Yeah.

08:24.000 --> 08:26.000
Good.

08:28.000 --> 08:32.500
- We're gonna drink to the line.
- Lower... please. Better.

08:32.534 --> 08:37.000
I make my important decisions
after reaching that line.

08:37.034 --> 08:40.000
I liked what you did.
It was really brave.

08:40.034 --> 08:42.017
- It stank.
- Ooh, God!

08:42.052 --> 08:43.965
You thought it stank?

08:44.000 --> 08:46.965
It wasn't about Sarajevo,
it was about YOU.

08:47.000 --> 08:51.000
Back home no one's heard of
Sarajevo but they all know me.

08:51.035 --> 08:53.517
- She with you?
- Freelance.

08:53.552 --> 08:55.965
Figures. Who would hire her?

08:56.000 --> 08:59.000
You should never drink
serious whisky without water

08:59.035 --> 09:01.000
because the strength of the alcohol

09:01.035 --> 09:03.000
smothers the complex flavour.

09:03.035 --> 09:04.965
Is that right?

09:05.000 --> 09:06.000
- Chiverly!
- Chiverly!

09:11.000 --> 09:11.965
Cheers.

09:12.000 --> 09:16.000
I am in love with you. In spite
of the company you keep.

09:16.035 --> 09:17.965
Thank you.

09:18.000 --> 09:19.965
I'd like to save you from this.

09:20.000 --> 09:24.000
Leaving so soon, Mr Flynn?
The war is young.

09:26.000 --> 09:27.965
- Hi.
- Zeljko.

09:28.000 --> 09:30.000
I got your phone-call, sir.

09:30.035 --> 09:31.965
Ah!

09:32.000 --> 09:34.000
Try - you might be lucky.

09:34.035 --> 09:36.000
Very good. Here.

09:36.035 --> 09:39.965
Oh. Thanks.

09:40.000 --> 09:41.000
- Here.
- Thanks.

09:41.035 --> 09:42.517
Thank you.

- Bye.

- Helen, hi, it's me.

09:49.000 --> 09:51.000
- 'Shit, sorry. '
- Helen?

09:51.035 --> 09:53.000
'Yeah, hang on.

09:54.000 --> 09:58.000

the kids to bed. '

10:10.035 --> 10:10.965

10:11.000 --> 10:16.000
Er, it's... well, you're an hour
behind - it's twenty past ten.

- 'She's awake again. '
- 'Mummy!'

10:19.035 --> 10:22.000

- Yeah. All right. You'd better go.

Um, I just...

12:32.000 --> 12:34.000
This is my last clean one.

12:34.035 --> 12:35.965
Thanks.

12:36.000 --> 12:39.000
It's from Marks & Spencer in Paris.

12:39.035 --> 12:41.017
You don't believe it?

12:41.052 --> 12:43.000
- No.
- What's this?

13:04.000 --> 13:07.000
Certainly is
a woman of experience.

13:07.035 --> 13:10.000

13:10.035 --> 13:13.000
- Yes.

be along shortly.

- Hi. Nice to meet you.
- Hey! Dig those threads.

13:25.035 --> 13:29.517
Yeah. It's a great colour.
Sort of unusual.

13:29.552 --> 13:34.000
My man, Zeljko!
Thank you. Do you have it?

13:34.005 --> 13:34.995
- Oh, brother!
- Four.

- Suit yourself.

You need a hangover cure?

13:55.035 --> 13:58.000
Would you mind
if I save it till later?

13:58.035 --> 14:00.000
I haven't started my hangover yet.

14:00.035 --> 14:02.017
Go ahead. Here, take...

14:02.052 --> 14:03.965
All I need's one. Take 'em.

14:04.000 --> 14:06.000
He's here now.
His English is pretty good.

14:06.035 --> 14:08.517
He studied in Birmingham or Bristol.

14:08.552 --> 14:11.000
- Hi, Mr Henderson.
- Man at C&A.

14:11.035 --> 14:13.017
- Marks & Spencer.
- What?

14:13.052 --> 14:14.965
C&A do a similar colour -

14:15.000 --> 14:17.000
only Marks & Spencer do THIS colour.

14:17.035 --> 14:19.000
Michael, mortar attack. Come on.

- Two eggs is a miracle!
- Three eggs!

15:21.035 --> 15:23.000
Is there a word for three eggs?

15:23.035 --> 15:24.965
- Omelette.
- Very good.

15:25.000 --> 15:28.000

- Yeah, of course.

OK. You drive. Who's got the keys?

Hi. Annie McGee.

16:46.000 --> 16:48.000
Shall we make a move?

17:06.000 --> 17:10.000
I know this probably
isn't the best time,

17:10.035 --> 17:12.517
but I'm working on a story.

17:12.551 --> 17:14.964
I need papers, transport...

17:15.000 --> 17:18.000
Talk to Jane Carson.
She's the producer.

17:18.035 --> 17:20.000
I'm just the journalist.

17:20.005 --> 17:20.994
- Smoke?
- No.

17:21.000 --> 17:23.964
This could be
a very important story.

17:24.000 --> 17:27.000
More important than
bombing people in the street?

17:27.035 --> 17:30.000
Compared to that, it seems
like fucking Jane Austen.

17:30.035 --> 17:32.000
Really? I never fucked Jane Austen.

19:03.000 --> 19:03.995

What's she saying?

19:27.535 --> 19:28.965
What's she saying?

19:29.000 --> 19:31.000
She doesn't know what she's saying.

19:31.035 --> 19:32.965
She's lost control.

19:33.000 --> 19:34.590
- You shouldn't film her.
- Get the bread.

19:43.005 --> 19:44.000
Risto!

20:03.000 --> 20:04.000
What?

20:06.000 --> 20:06.995
Don't understand. Risto!

20:07.000 --> 20:11.000
Can you ask this girl what she wants?
Ask what she wants.

20:19.000 --> 20:21.000
Both the parents are dead.

20:27.000 --> 20:30.000
We'll have to tell her.

20:30.035 --> 20:31.000
Yeah.

20:39.000 --> 20:43.000

or sisters who could take her?

Any relatives
we can give her a lift to?

25:07.000 --> 25:10.000
Risto, have you got the key?

25:10.035 --> 25:11.517
The little one, here.

25:11.552 --> 25:13.000
Come through here.

25:13.035 --> 25:14.517
Michael...

25:14.552 --> 25:15.965
That's good!

25:16.000 --> 25:18.965
There's a little
one. Move him to the front.

25:19.000 --> 25:23.000
'For these children, home
is the Ljubica Ivezic Orphanage

25:23.035 --> 25:25.000
'on one of Sarajevo's
many front lines. '

25:27.000 --> 25:30.000
- You should wear them.
- I quite like them.

25:30.035 --> 25:32.517
Everyone else is wearing them.

25:32.552 --> 25:34.965
That RTL driver was saved by his.

25:35.000 --> 25:39.000
- Wear them on petrol runs.
- Mm, all right.

25:39.035 --> 25:42.517
I don't know if we
can get insured without them.

25:42.552 --> 25:45.776
- I know you don't like them...
- Shh! Listen.

25:45.811 --> 25:49.000
'I buried these children
in the garden... '

25:49.035 --> 25:50.965
Wonder if she's insured (!)

25:51.000 --> 25:53.965
'.. everyone can see we are dying.

25:54.000 --> 25:59.000
'So I will not put them away,
out of sight.

25:59.035 --> 26:02.000
'Everyone must know we are dying.

26:03.000 --> 26:04.965
'So... tell them.

26:05.000 --> 26:08.000
'Keep on telling them
until they will move us. '

26:16.000 --> 26:19.965
'If it is possible
to treat children there,

26:20.000 --> 26:24.000
'near to their families, with
people who speak their language

26:24.035 --> 26:26.000
'and in relatively
familiar surroundings,

26:26.035 --> 26:28.965
'then that is the best way. '

26:29.000 --> 26:32.000
(# Bobby McFerrin:
"Don't Worry, Be Happy")

26:47.000 --> 26:49.965
# Here's a little song I wrote

26:50.000 --> 26:53.000
# You might want
to sing it note for note

26:53.035 --> 26:54.000
# Don't worry

26:56.000 --> 26:56.965
# Be happy... #

26:57.000 --> 27:00.000
God, I've never seen
such clean-looking people.

27:00.035 --> 27:03.965
# In every life we have some trouble

27:04.000 --> 27:06.000
# But when you worry,
you make it double

# Don't worry

27:09.052 --> 27:11.965
# Be happy #

27:12.000 --> 27:14.000
Orphanages and hospitals
are being shelled daily.

27:14.035 --> 27:17.017
Will you evacuate
the children and the sick?

27:17.052 --> 27:19.965
We are here to consider
a range of options.

27:20.000 --> 27:24.000
I know it's difficult but we
have to keep our perspective.

27:24.035 --> 27:27.000
We deal with 13 countries
in the world

27:27.035 --> 27:29.017
which are WORSE than Sarajevo.

27:29.052 --> 27:32.026
Sir, just out of curiosity,

27:32.061 --> 27:34.965
what are those other 13 places?

27:35.000 --> 27:37.000
Are we slidin' up or down that scale?

27:39.000 --> 27:41.965
'Emira has been here
since she was a baby.

27:42.000 --> 27:47.000
'Now she's so frightened,
she can't sleep at night. '

27:52.000 --> 27:55.000
'Sead's mother was killed
in a mortar attack.

28:01.000 --> 28:04.000
'Zaned is from a village
near Sarajevo.

'His father and two older brothers

'were taken prisoner
by Serb irregulars,

'the feared Chetniks.

28:10.000 --> 28:14.000
'His mother was shot by a sniper
whilst queuing for water. '

28:18.000 --> 28:20.000
Got a permission letter
from Radovan Karadjic

28:20.035 --> 28:23.017
so we can get behind Serb lines.

28:23.052 --> 28:25.965
It can't
be much of a story, then.

28:26.000 --> 28:31.000
Anyway, we've got a story.
50 kids who could be blown up

28:31.035 --> 28:33.000
and nobody's paying any attention.

28:33.005 --> 28:33.995
We've done that story.

28:34.000 --> 28:36.965
We've STARTED that story.
They're still there.

28:37.000 --> 28:41.000
As long as the UN's here
I'll keep those kids on screen.

28:41.035 --> 28:42.965
Same message - "Get me out. "

28:43.000 --> 28:45.965
That's not news. That's a campaign.

28:46.000 --> 28:50.000
I don't care.
I'm gonna get those kids out.

28:50.005 --> 28:50.995
What's the problem?

28:51.000 --> 28:55.000
Big guns, little children,
evil men - great television.

28:55.035 --> 28:57.965
- If it works.
- Good night.

28:58.000 --> 29:01.000
- Won't listen, will he?
- Oh, dear!

29:04.000 --> 29:05.965
Since the war,

29:06.000 --> 29:08.000
the orphanage has taken in
not only babies

29:08.035 --> 29:09.965
but also older children,

29:10.000 --> 29:13.000
many of whom have witnessed
terrible events

29:13.035 --> 29:16.000
as well as being separated
from their families.

29:16.035 --> 29:19.965
'One day my mum went to work

29:20.000 --> 29:23.000
'and was told she couldn't
work there any more

29:23.035 --> 29:24.965
'because she was a Muslim.

29:25.000 --> 29:29.000
'Then it was announced
that all Muslims had to leave.

29:33.000 --> 29:36.000
'There was shelling,
all sorts of things.

29:36.035 --> 29:38.017
'There were dead people around.

29:38.052 --> 29:40.000
'I've got nothing to say about it.

29:40.035 --> 29:42.000
'It was terrible. '

29:51.000 --> 29:55.000
'Where my house is.
I'd like to go back there. '

30:02.000 --> 30:02.995
Yours, yeah?

30:03.000 --> 30:05.000
Hello. Yours, yeah?

30:11.000 --> 30:14.000
She ask if this
is where you come from.

30:14.035 --> 30:16.965
Ah! Yes. Yes.

30:17.000 --> 30:19.000
It's changed a bit since then.

30:22.000 --> 30:23.965
She want to get out of Sarajevo.

30:24.000 --> 30:27.000
Your film would help
to get us out of here?

30:29.000 --> 30:31.000
Yes. I hope so.

30:32.000 --> 30:34.000
She wants a promise.

30:34.035 --> 30:36.000
It's a promise.

31:03.000 --> 31:06.000
It's a Haggadah.
It's the story of the Exodus.

31:06.035 --> 31:06.965
Oh.

31:07.000 --> 31:11.000
It was in the museum. When
the Nazis came, it disappeared.

31:11.035 --> 31:14.017
When the war was over, it was back.

31:14.052 --> 31:16.526
And now it's disappeared again.

31:16.561 --> 31:18.965
- It's lovely.
- Yeah, it's nice.

31:19.000 --> 31:23.000
On the real one you can see
fingerprints and wine stains

31:23.005 --> 31:23.995
where it's been used.

31:24.000 --> 31:28.000
People say that after this war,
it will return.

31:28.035 --> 31:30.000
But it's been sold to buy weapons.

31:30.035 --> 31:31.965
No, that's not true.

31:32.000 --> 31:35.500
When the museum was bombed, the
old guy, Professor Imamovich,

31:35.535 --> 31:39.000
he found the book in the rubble.
Now it's somewhere safe.

31:39.035 --> 31:40.965
It'll be back.

31:41.000 --> 31:46.000
- What are you doing?
- I use books to cook with.

31:47.000 --> 31:49.000
It's all there is.

31:50.000 --> 31:54.000
If you have to burn books,
you should at least enjoy it.

31:54.035 --> 31:57.517
You know - special occasion,
special book.

31:57.552 --> 32:01.000
Besides, I could never
relate to the Exodus.

32:03.000 --> 32:06.000
(# The Happy Mondays: "Donovan")

32:20.000 --> 32:22.965
You know what I'm going to do?

32:23.000 --> 32:26.000
I'm going to make
a concert here in Sarajevo.

32:26.035 --> 32:27.965
Is that such a good idea?

32:28.000 --> 32:32.965
- I will defy death in the name of Art.
- What about the audience?

32:33.000 --> 32:36.000
The audience will die happy
listening to me.

32:36.035 --> 32:38.965
But I'm not going to do it yet,

32:39.000 --> 32:43.000
because Sarajevo is only
the 14th worst place on Earth.

32:43.035 --> 32:46.017
I'm waiting until we're number one.

32:46.052 --> 32:49.000
- What is number one?
- LA, of course.

33:00.000 --> 33:01.965
Help with the babies.

33:02.000 --> 33:04.000
You want the children upstairs?

33:04.035 --> 33:06.000
- Yes.
- OK.

33:11.000 --> 33:13.965
'We came here this evening

33:14.000 --> 33:17.500
'to make another report
on the Ljubica Ivezic Orphanage.

33:17.535 --> 33:20.767

next door was on fire

had been destroyed. '

33:37.000 --> 33:40.000
Roadrunner's coming.
Come on. Let's go.

33:50.000 --> 33:51.965
The Bosnian government

33:52.000 --> 33:54.965
is against any kind of evacuation.

33:55.000 --> 33:58.000
From their point of view,
the Serbs want the city empty.

33:58.035 --> 34:01.000
If they evacuate,
we're helping the Serbs.

34:01.035 --> 34:04.000
Evacuation is actually
collaboration,

34:04.035 --> 34:05.965
and that's a quote.

34:06.000 --> 34:10.000
It will take time to find
a solution to the problem.

34:10.034 --> 34:12.000
Thus we must have patience.

34:39.000 --> 34:40.500
This is cold.

34:40.534 --> 34:41.965
Here, have mine.

34:42.000 --> 34:45.500
- Zeljko!
- No, I want a fresh cup.

34:45.534 --> 34:48.766
- Is that hot?
- I want a fresh cup.

34:48.802 --> 34:52.000
- Got a pen?
- Give me your book.

34:54.000 --> 34:56.000
Look at 'em. They're like vultures.

34:57.000 --> 34:59.000
Look at US. We're like vultures.

35:01.000 --> 35:03.000
Working vultures. It's grand.

35:04.000 --> 35:06.000
Great.

35:10.000 --> 35:14.000
That's mine
and Mr Henderson is inside.

35:14.035 --> 35:16.965
- Happy?
- Thanks.

35:17.000 --> 35:19.000
- Thank you.
- OK. Bye.

35:21.000 --> 35:23.000
Just a sec. Thanks.

It's extraordinary, is it not,

35:33.000 --> 35:36.000
that with children trapped
in the most dangerous corner

35:36.035 --> 35:38.965
of the most dangerous city on Earth

35:39.000 --> 35:43.000
that this plane will fly
out of here completely empty.

35:43.035 --> 35:45.965
'It would be a simple matter
to move the children

35:46.000 --> 35:51.000
'but someone somewhere along the
bureaucratic line is saying no. '

36:24.000 --> 36:28.000
Cheer up, Michael.
You'll be back in London by Tuesday.

36:29.000 --> 36:32.000
Put that back.
That's my lucky hat.

36:32.035 --> 36:33.965
Working wonders for us.

36:34.000 --> 36:37.000
Six years in that -
I've never been shot.

36:37.035 --> 36:40.000
Swap it for my lucky knickers?

36:40.035 --> 36:41.965
- No.
- Charming.

36:42.000 --> 36:45.000
I'm not gonna film a war
wearing your knickers.

36:45.035 --> 36:46.965
On your head!

36:47.000 --> 36:49.500
Do they stop you getting shot?

36:49.535 --> 36:52.000
No. I just get lucky wearing them.

36:57.000 --> 36:59.000
Flynn!

37:00.000 --> 37:03.000
Where've you been? Thought
you'd gone to the seaside.

37:03.035 --> 37:05.000
Met a lady who needed a lift.

37:05.035 --> 37:07.017
- Hi, Henderson.
- Hi.

37:07.052 --> 37:09.026
- Annie.
- Get it?

37:09.061 --> 37:10.965
- Yeah.
- Got what?

37:11.000 --> 37:15.000
- Was it terrible?
- Yeah. It WAS terrible.

37:17.000 --> 37:22.000
- Where've you been?
- Uh, Omarska and Trnopolie.

37:22.005 --> 37:23.000
It was... a real party.

37:30.000 --> 37:33.500
'ITN was given
permission to visit these camps

'These are the ones
we were allowed to talk to. '

38:05.000 --> 38:08.000
Can you just hold on?
Hold on. Michael...

38:08.035 --> 38:08.965
Sorry.

38:09.000 --> 38:11.965
I... didn't wanna
let it go and, um...

38:12.000 --> 38:16.000
No, no, no. You did
the right thing. Absolutely.

38:16.035 --> 38:18.000
- Well done.
- Thanks.

38:19.000 --> 38:22.000
Annie, it's a great story.
Congratulations.

38:23.000 --> 38:25.000
Thank you.

38:42.000 --> 38:43.965
Henderson.

38:44.000 --> 38:46.965
- You, uh... you got any petrol?
- Yeah.

38:47.000 --> 38:51.000
You think I might be able
to get a lift across town?

38:51.035 --> 38:53.000
- Now?
- Yeah.

38:54.000 --> 38:55.000
Yeah. All right.

38:55.035 --> 38:57.000
Top man!

39:14.000 --> 39:14.965
Yeah. Uh...

39:34.000 --> 39:35.965
You speak Bosnian, eh?

39:36.000 --> 39:39.500
Describing it in English,
it doesn't sound real.

39:39.535 --> 39:43.000
If any language could
do it justice, it's Bosnian.

39:43.005 --> 39:43.995
And does it?

39:44.000 --> 39:47.000
I'm still learning.
Little, simple things.

39:47.035 --> 39:49.017
Um, "do you have an avocado?"

39:49.052 --> 39:51.000
"I'm desperate for a toilet. "

39:52.000 --> 39:53.965

- Ah.

like that. Thank you.

39:58.005 --> 39:59.000
Here's the cake.

40:01.000 --> 40:04.000
- Take the small piece.
- Toast.

40:07.000 --> 40:10.000
- What's that?
- To their son.

40:10.035 --> 40:12.000
Yeah. To your son.

- Why?

42:10.035 --> 42:11.965
Why is it that Americans,

42:12.000 --> 42:15.000
when they're playing sport,
wear so much padding?

42:15.035 --> 42:18.017
You spend more time
dressing up than playing.

42:18.052 --> 42:21.000
Sure, we don't dress
to the nines like cricket.

42:21.035 --> 42:23.965
But... what about basketball?
Just a vest.

42:24.000 --> 42:27.000
Basketball isn't a sport.
Basketball's a freak show.

42:27.035 --> 42:28.965
Easy. You're on sacred territory.

42:29.000 --> 42:32.000
The side with
the tallest player wins.

42:32.035 --> 42:33.965
Also, it's a girls' game.

42:34.000 --> 42:38.000
You know, only two good
things ever came from England.

42:38.035 --> 42:40.000
One - America, two - the Beatles.

42:40.035 --> 42:42.000
Beatles aren't English.

42:43.000 --> 42:44.965
They're from Liverpool.

42:45.000 --> 42:47.000
You even pad up to play girls' games.

42:49.000 --> 42:50.500
You know...

42:50.535 --> 42:52.000
Henderson...

42:53.000 --> 42:56.000
Those orphans are not
your responsibility.

42:56.035 --> 42:58.000
You're here, you're a reporter.

42:58.035 --> 43:02.000
You're here to report.

43:04.000 --> 43:07.000
FUCK YOU! ASSHOLE!

43:07.005 --> 43:08.000
GET A JOB!

43:17.000 --> 43:20.000
Zeljko. Would you take care of these?

43:20.035 --> 43:22.000
Mr Henderson, you leaving?

43:22.035 --> 43:23.965
Yes.

43:24.000 --> 43:26.000
Have some of those. I don't smoke.

43:26.035 --> 43:29.000
- Thank you very much.
- OK.

43:35.000 --> 43:37.000
- Oh, hi there.
- Hi.

43:39.000 --> 43:41.000
- Good night?
- Yeah. Very good.

43:41.035 --> 43:43.965
- Hi.
- This is Nina.

43:44.000 --> 43:48.000
Hello. Welcome to the
14th worst place on Earth.

43:48.005 --> 43:48.995
Thanks.

43:49.000 --> 43:52.000
- Nina's an aid worker.
- Is this water?

43:52.035 --> 43:54.965
- Yeah.
- Can I...?

43:55.000 --> 43:58.000
A children's charity.
The Children's Lifeline.

43:58.035 --> 44:01.000
We've got a bus.
Bring in food and take out kids.

44:01.035 --> 44:04.517
I'm pitching our story
to your network.

44:04.552 --> 44:07.965
- What sort of children?
- Boys and girls.

44:08.000 --> 44:12.000
Children who are sponsored
abroad or have relatives abroad.

44:12.035 --> 44:14.965
And babies.
They're easy to find homes for.

44:15.000 --> 44:19.000
I can get babies. There's an
orphanage on the front line.

44:19.035 --> 44:21.965
- D'you need babies?
- Aren't you leaving?

44:22.000 --> 44:26.000
You COULD leave - with us.
An epic story for you.

44:26.005 --> 44:27.000
The Exodus!

44:39.000 --> 44:41.000
Can you help any of them?

44:43.000 --> 44:46.000
Well... we'll try. We'll try.

44:58.000 --> 44:59.000
It's for the baby.

45:05.000 --> 45:07.000
What's their name?

45:15.000 --> 45:18.000
She thinks that she's going.

45:20.000 --> 45:22.000
She says, "You promised me. "

45:41.000 --> 45:44.000
It's OK if we don't have
birth certificates.

45:48.000 --> 45:49.965
Here they are.

45:50.000 --> 45:54.000
If she had somewhere to go,
could you take her?

45:54.035 --> 45:55.965
- Nina?
- What?

45:56.000 --> 45:58.000
Emira. She wants to leave.

45:58.035 --> 46:00.000
Does she have somewhere to go?

46:02.000 --> 46:04.965
- No.
- No, I can't take her.

46:05.000 --> 46:09.000
We have to prove the older kids
are visiting relatives.

46:09.035 --> 46:10.965
No evacuation - that was the deal.

46:11.000 --> 46:15.000
- What if she was visiting me?
- What d'you mean?

46:15.035 --> 46:19.000
If she was coming to London
to visit me...?

46:19.035 --> 46:21.000
It's not that simple.

46:28.000 --> 46:31.000
Mrs Savic?

46:34.000 --> 46:38.000
I can't speak for her.
You have to ask her yourself.

46:47.000 --> 46:49.000
What's that?
Is that a yes?

46:49.035 --> 46:50.965
Yes. That's yes.

46:51.000 --> 46:54.000
I thought she might want to stay.

46:54.035 --> 46:56.000
She's been with me always.

46:57.000 --> 46:59.965
But it's OK. I'm glad she doesn't.

47:00.000 --> 47:04.000
It's just for a short time.
Until the war's over.

47:04.035 --> 47:05.965
Yeah...

47:06.000 --> 47:09.000
For a short time. I hope so.

47:14.000 --> 47:14.995
Hello, TV man.

47:15.000 --> 47:16.000
You got any cigarettes?

47:48.000 --> 47:51.000
You know this is
completely illegal, don't you?

47:51.005 --> 47:52.000
Yes.

47:54.000 --> 47:57.000
Why are you doing this?

47:58.000 --> 47:58.995
I don't know.

47:59.000 --> 48:01.500
- Married?
- Yes.

48:01.535 --> 48:04.000
- Kids?
- Yes.

48:05.000 --> 48:08.000
OK. I don't want anyone
to know what you're doing.

48:08.035 --> 48:11.000
Not your news crew,
your producer, no one.

48:11.035 --> 48:13.965
Don't sit near her on the bus.

48:14.000 --> 48:17.000
I want you to treat Emira
like all the other kids.

48:17.035 --> 48:19.000
Right.

48:23.000 --> 48:25.000
I'm very grateful.

48:28.000 --> 48:30.965
'At last
there is good news

48:31.000 --> 48:34.000
'for the children of
Ljubica Ivezic Orphanage.

48:34.035 --> 48:37.000
'Five babies have got places
on a convoy

48:37.005 --> 48:37.995
'taking children to Italy,

48:38.000 --> 48:40.965
'where they can stay
till the fighting is over.

48:41.000 --> 48:46.000
'They'll have to leave behind
more than 100 older children

48:46.035 --> 48:47.965
'who aren't so lucky.

48:48.000 --> 48:51.000
'Their daily struggle
to survive seems without end. '

48:52.000 --> 48:54.965
'The babies are not
out of danger yet.

48:55.000 --> 48:58.500
'Landmines and mortars

48:58.535 --> 49:01.965
'that lie between them
and the safety of Italy.

49:02.000 --> 49:08.000
'Last week, snipers fired on
a bus trying to leave Sarajevo.

49:08.035 --> 49:10.000
'Two babies were killed. '

49:11.000 --> 49:14.000
Are you worried
about the children?

49:14.005 --> 49:14.995
Yes, I am.

49:15.000 --> 49:18.965
But we have a one-hour
ceasefire throughout Sarajevo

49:19.000 --> 49:22.000
and permission from authorities
on both sides to bring them.

49:22.035 --> 49:25.000
What's the alternative?
To leave them here?

49:26.000 --> 49:27.965
'The mothers of the children
leaving today

49:28.000 --> 49:33.000
'clearly feel it is more
dangerous to stay than to go. '

49:52.000 --> 49:55.000
I'd like to apologise
on behalf of the American people

49:55.035 --> 49:57.965
for not delivering
on those air strikes.

49:58.000 --> 50:01.000
If things were reversed -
Muslims slaughtering Christians,

50:01.035 --> 50:04.000
we'd have done something by now.

51:11.000 --> 51:14.000
We have safe passage
through this street.

51:15.000 --> 51:16.000
This is the street, right?

51:18.000 --> 51:19.000
Door, please.

51:21.000 --> 51:23.500
- Back!
- What's happening?

51:23.535 --> 51:25.965
They won't let us through.

51:26.000 --> 51:28.500
They're sending us
the long way round.

51:28.535 --> 51:31.000
Everybody back!
Back on the bus, please.

52:28.000 --> 52:32.000
Sorry about this. They insist
on searching the bus.

52:32.035 --> 52:34.017
You'll have to get everybody off.

52:34.052 --> 52:36.000
OK, they wanna search the bus.

52:37.000 --> 52:40.000
We have to get off. It'll be OK.

52:59.000 --> 53:02.000
Back on. We're all right.
We're OK. We're going.

53:42.000 --> 53:45.000
It's... It's really like
where I come from.

53:46.000 --> 53:51.000
Apart from the mountains
and the water and the sun.

53:51.005 --> 53:52.000
Very, very similar.

53:53.000 --> 53:55.000
Elton John.

54:49.000 --> 54:50.000
OK.

55:00.000 --> 55:01.965
It's so quiet.

55:02.000 --> 55:05.000
- Treetop.
- Treetop.

55:05.035 --> 55:06.517
Tree top.

55:06.552 --> 55:08.000
Tree... top.

55:08.005 --> 55:08.995
Top.

55:09.000 --> 55:11.965
You'd be better off
teaching her Italian.

55:12.000 --> 55:15.000
- That's where she's going.
- You know Italian?

55:18.000 --> 55:21.000
- Look... tree...
- Tree.

55:21.035 --> 55:23.017
- Top.
- Top.

55:23.052 --> 55:25.000
- Helen.
- Helen.

- Christopher.
- Christopher.

- London in...
- London in...

55:38.035 --> 55:40.517
- England.
- England.

55:40.552 --> 55:43.000
- England in...
- London.

55:43.005 --> 55:44.000
No...

56:01.000 --> 56:02.000
Good night.

57:09.000 --> 57:10.965
We... give full guarantees

57:11.000 --> 57:14.000
according to Geneva Convention
for civilians.

57:20.000 --> 57:22.000
You can't negotiate with a terrorist.

57:50.000 --> 57:52.000
- Quickly, quickly.
- Onto the bus.

57:52.035 --> 57:53.965
That's it, that's it.

57:54.000 --> 57:58.000
Get 'em on the back door. Come on!

57:58.035 --> 58:00.000
Let's go! Quickly! Come on!

58:41.000 --> 58:43.000
Chetniks.

58:54.000 --> 58:56.500
We've got documentation here

58:56.535 --> 58:58.767
from your people in Pale.

58:58.802 --> 59:00.901
- Pale, eh?
- That's right.

59:00.936 --> 59:03.468
There's, uh, the official seal.

59:03.503 --> 59:05.965
I have the rest
of the documents.

59:06.000 --> 59:10.000
That's permission to go through
all the different territories.

59:10.035 --> 59:13.000
Be cool, it'll be fine.

59:25.000 --> 59:27.965
Oh, oh, oh. We have no Muslims.

59:28.000 --> 59:32.000
No Muslim children
on this bus. No Muslims.

59:34.000 --> 59:36.000
We have no Muslim children...

59:36.035 --> 59:37.965
OK!

59:38.000 --> 59:41.000
Why is he taking these kids?

59:47.000 --> 59:52.000
We have documents for these
children. They are not Muslim!

59:53.000 --> 59:54.965
What's he saying?

59:55.000 --> 59:59.000
What does he want?
I'll give it to him!

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:05.965
Munira, tell him now,

01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:10.000
we have papers to get us
through this territory.

01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:16.000
We have documents for each
and every child on this bus.

01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:26.000
No, no. She's English. She's with me.

01:00:26.005 --> 01:00:27.000
She's English!

01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:43.000
Emira! Stop!

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:46.000
Stay here.

01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.000
Where are they taking them?!

01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.000
Stay. Stay.

01:01:45.000 --> 01:01:47.000
There wasn't anything you could do.

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:03.000
Can you swim?

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:15.000
Leila!

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:33.000
Looks like you missed the boat, kid.

01:03:33.035 --> 01:03:36.000
- The boat?
- Mmm. You should be on it.

01:03:36.035 --> 01:03:38.000
No.

01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:50.500
- 'Hello?'
- Hello. It's me.

01:03:50.535 --> 01:03:52.767
'Michael! Hi! Where are you?'

01:03:52.802 --> 01:03:54.965
In Split. I'll be home tomorrow.

01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:58.000
'Oh, brilliant!
Is everything all right?'

01:03:58.035 --> 01:04:01.000
Yeah. I'm talking quietly
'cause, uh...

01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:06.000
I'm bringing someone home with me.

01:04:06.035 --> 01:04:09.000
'It's not Gregg, is it?'

01:04:09.035 --> 01:04:11.000
No... no, not Gregg.

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:16.000
She's a girl from Sarajevo.
She's from the orphanage.

01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:22.000
I wanted to call earlier
but I didn't know what to say.

01:04:22.035 --> 01:04:24.965
- 'How old is she?'
- She's nine.

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:27.965
I don't really know
why I've done this.

01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:31.965
She'd somehow thought
that I could help her get out.

01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:38.000
And I realised that I could and
there wasn't any reason not to.

01:04:42.000 --> 01:04:43.000
'Well, it's, uh...

01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:48.000
'It's good, I guess.
It's... it's good. '

01:04:48.035 --> 01:04:50.517
Yeah?

01:04:50.552 --> 01:04:53.000
'Yeah. '

01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:57.965
'Mmm... Hmm. '

01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:01.000
- You OK?
- 'Yeah. Yeah. I'm fine.

01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:05.500
- 'Just come home, OK?'
- OK.

01:05:05.535 --> 01:05:08.267
'OK. Can't wait to see you. '

01:05:08.302 --> 01:05:11.000
Well, we'll see you tomorrow.

01:05:11.005 --> 01:05:12.000
'See you tomorrow. '

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:19.000
# I've... I've got a reason

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:27.000
# To know your name

01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:35.000
# I've... I've got a reason

01:05:41.000 --> 01:05:45.000
# To stay the same

01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:51.500
# I've made up my mind

01:05:51.535 --> 01:05:55.000
# Life's not unkind... #

01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:58.000
- January.
- January.

01:05:58.005 --> 01:05:59.000
- February.
- February.

01:05:59.015 --> 01:06:00.017
- March.
- March.

01:06:00.052 --> 01:06:01.526
- April.
- April.

01:06:01.561 --> 01:06:02.965
- May.
- May.

01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:07.000
# Happy birthday to you!

01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:12.000
# Happy birthday to you!

01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:18.000
# Happy birthday, dear Emira

01:06:18.035 --> 01:06:23.000
# Happy birthday to you! #

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:32.000
# I've... I've got a reason

01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:39.000
# That keeps me singing... #

01:06:39.035 --> 01:06:41.000
Richard!

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:45.000
Quick, quick! Go on, Chris. Your go.

01:06:47.000 --> 01:06:49.000
Out! Howzat?

01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:55.965
Hello?

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:58.000
It's for you.

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:02.000
- Coffee?
- No, thanks.

01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:03.995
Hello.

01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:06.500
- 'Henderson. '
- Flynn!

01:07:06.535 --> 01:07:08.965
How did you get a call out?

01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:13.000
The network got me one
of these satellite phones.

01:07:13.035 --> 01:07:17.000
I'm selling calls on the side,
making a fortune.

01:07:17.035 --> 01:07:18.965
I hope the war keeps up.

01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:23.000
Listen, the woman I love -
you know, one way -

01:07:23.035 --> 01:07:25.000
wants to talk to you...
brace yourself.

01:07:25.035 --> 01:07:28.000
- 'Hi, Michael. '
- Hi, Jane.

01:07:28.005 --> 01:07:28.995
'How's the kid?'

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:32.000
Oh... Yeah. Good, you know?

01:07:32.035 --> 01:07:33.965
Complicated but good.

01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:37.000
- Does she wanna come back?
- No.

01:07:37.035 --> 01:07:39.000
The thing is... that, um...

01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:44.000
someone here wants her to come back.

01:07:44.035 --> 01:07:45.965
Someone like who?

01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:48.000
The uncle contacted us here.

01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:53.000
She has a mother, Michael,
and she wants her back.

01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:55.000
'Sorry, Michael. '

01:07:57.000 --> 01:08:00.000
I shouldn't have brought her out.

01:08:00.005 --> 01:08:01.000
Of course you should.

01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:13.000
What's it gonna be like
for her now, going back?

01:08:13.035 --> 01:08:17.000
- It's just...
- Maybe she won't have to go.

01:08:17.035 --> 01:08:17.965
Mmm?

01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:21.000
Maybe she won't have to go back.

01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:29.000
I didn't know she had a mother.

01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:32.000
I know, I know.

01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:56.000
- When are you going?
- Tomorrow.

01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:01.965
How long will you be?

01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:05.000
I don't know.
I have to find your mother.

01:09:05.035 --> 01:09:07.000
Depends where she is.

01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:15.000
I have to get her to sign some
papers. Then we can adopt you.

01:09:15.035 --> 01:09:17.000
What if she says no?

01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:21.000
She won't.

01:09:21.035 --> 01:09:23.000
Don't worry.

01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:57.000
- Michael...?
- Sorry.

01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:04.000
- You OK?
- Yeah.

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:07.000
Yeah. What's the time?

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:13.000
Half past six.

01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:15.000
Gotta go.

01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:54.000
Welcome to
Miss Beseiged Sarajevo.

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:12.965
# And you... tell me

01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:17.000
# Over and over
and over again, my friend

01:11:17.035 --> 01:11:19.965
# Ah, you don't believe

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:22.000
# We're on the eve
of destruction... #

01:11:22.035 --> 01:11:24.000
- Hey! Henderson, hey!
- Flynn!

01:11:24.035 --> 01:11:25.965
# And you tell me

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:28.965
# Over and over
and over again... #

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:32.965
- You never got another job?
- No, I am,

01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:36.000
I'm covering the Miss World
contest. Starting with Sarajevo.

01:11:36.035 --> 01:11:40.000
You're serious about this
place, Flynn, admit it.

01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:46.000
Look who's here.

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:50.000
Jane, what's happened to you?

01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:56.000
# And you tell me... #

01:11:56.035 --> 01:11:57.965
- Welcome back.
- Hi.

01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:01.000
#.. and over again, my friend

01:12:01.035 --> 01:12:03.965
If we ever get out of here,

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:06.500
we're ALL gonna take the kids back!

01:12:06.535 --> 01:12:09.000
Good idea!
You'll make a great mother.

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:56.000
I'm looking
for Risto Bavic.

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:11.000
Michael. Welcome to hell.

01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:27.000
Brought you some Mars Bars
in the hotel.

01:13:27.035 --> 01:13:29.517
Fantastic. I started to get cravings.

01:13:29.552 --> 01:13:32.000
It's like being pregnant, you know?

01:13:32.035 --> 01:13:33.965
This week, it's dental floss.

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:37.000
I never flossed my teeth in my life,

01:13:37.035 --> 01:13:39.517
but... I want some floss now.

01:13:39.552 --> 01:13:42.000
And before that, warmth. Oh...

01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:45.000
- You haven't changed.
- I have.

01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:48.965
I have lost my innocence.

01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:50.965
I don't remember
you having innocence.

01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:54.965
I thought my life and the
siege were different things.

01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:59.000
Now I realise there is no life
in Sarajevo except the siege.

01:13:59.035 --> 01:14:00.965
The siege IS Sarajevo.

01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:04.000
If you're not part of it,
you're dreaming, asleep.

01:14:05.000 --> 01:14:07.000
You've killed someone.

01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:11.000
Yes. It was not so bad.

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:15.000
I don't know... therapeutic.

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:53.000
These are of Emira's mother.

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:58.000
She looks, uh, like Emira here.

01:14:58.035 --> 01:14:59.965
No. No Emira, Munira.

01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:02.000
I'm just saying she looks like Emira.

01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:22.000
He says, uh, her family
made her give the baby up.

01:15:22.035 --> 01:15:24.000
And now he wants to help.

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:30.000
Is this her address?

01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:04.000
Ciao!

01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:07.000
This is where they want her to live?

01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:25.000
Ready to play Sarajevo's
favourite game?

01:17:25.005 --> 01:17:25.995
What's that?

01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:29.000
It's called, "Is there a God?"

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:01.000
- Does he know?
- I don't know.

01:18:01.035 --> 01:18:03.517
We shouldn't go with him.

01:18:03.552 --> 01:18:05.776
- Why?
- I don't know him.

01:18:05.811 --> 01:18:08.000
- It's OK.
- Hey, Michael...

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:10.500
Michael, don't!

01:18:10.535 --> 01:18:12.000
It's all right.

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:15.000
Come on, come on.

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:27.995
No, no, no.

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:29.965
We're just looking for someone.

01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:33.000
No, no, no. We're just looking for...

01:18:33.035 --> 01:18:36.000
- Could you tell them?
- I know.

01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:45.965
It's OK.

01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:48.500
It's OK. It's all right.
It's all right.

01:18:48.535 --> 01:18:51.000
We're looking for someone.
We're not police.

01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:59.000
Deutschmarks. Deutschmarks, here.

01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:10.000
English! Thank you very much!

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:18.995
Now what?

01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:23.000
- Don't bring her back here.
- I'm TRYING not to.

01:19:23.035 --> 01:19:24.965
- Promise me.
- What?

01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:27.000
- Promise me.
- All right.

01:19:27.035 --> 01:19:28.965
All right, I promise.

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:32.000
No one should have
to come back to this.

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:43.000
There are compensations
to being in a siege.

01:19:43.005 --> 01:19:43.995
Oh, yeah?

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:48.000
There's this girl called Inela.
I went to school with her.

01:19:48.035 --> 01:19:52.000
She's the most beautiful
girl in the world, no question.

01:19:52.035 --> 01:19:53.965
But she doesn't look at me.

01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:57.000
I don't know why.
What's wrong with me?

01:19:57.035 --> 01:19:59.965
Now in Sarajevo,
everything is for sale.

01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:04.000
I figure one day soon, even
Inela herself will be for sale.

01:20:04.035 --> 01:20:05.965
I got a packet of Marlboro

01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:08.965
and cake of soap
hidden away for then.

01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:14.000
Listen, I'm going to find her
and she will be for sale.

01:20:14.035 --> 01:20:17.017
I will buy her, dang, dang, dang,

01:20:17.052 --> 01:20:20.026
and die really, really happy.
Inela!

01:20:20.061 --> 01:20:23.000
See, every cloud has a silver lining.

01:20:23.035 --> 01:20:24.965
Have you seen her, this Inela?

01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:28.000
Yeah, but I think
she's past her best.

01:20:28.035 --> 01:20:29.965
So is he.

01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:30.995
Aren't we all?

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:34.000
Look at me -
a little grey but still...

01:20:34.035 --> 01:20:35.965
Still hot?

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:37.965
Still hot, baby, yeah.

01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:41.000
(# The Rolling Stones:
"Waiting On A Friend")

01:20:41.035 --> 01:20:44.000
You're maybe further past
than most, Risto.

01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:53.000
Not looking good so far, is it?

01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:12.965
- Mr Henderson.
- Hello.

01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:15.965
Don't you remember me?
I remember YOU.

01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:20.000
- I worked in the Holiday Inn.
- Yes, I do.

01:21:20.005 --> 01:21:20.995
- Zeljko.
- Zeljko.

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:22.965
- You gave me cigarettes.
- Yeah.

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:27.000
They were... very useful. Now
I'd like to return the favour.

01:21:27.035 --> 01:21:31.000
I'm told you need help.
I can help you.

01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:24.000
- You're getting soft!
- God!

01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:27.000
I peaked on the sixth.

01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:29.965
Oh, God!

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:32.000
Come on, you slack arse!
Get up!

01:22:32.005 --> 01:22:33.000
Very funny.

01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:37.000
Oh, my God! OH, GOD!

01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:02.000
Oh, fuck!

01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:14.000
# Don't need a whore

01:23:14.035 --> 01:23:15.965
# Don't need no fools

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:19.965
# Don't need a virgin priest

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:25.000
# But I need someone
I can cry to

01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:33.000
# I need someone to protect

01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:40.000
# Ooh, making love
and breaking hearts

01:23:40.035 --> 01:23:43.000
# It is a game for you

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:49.000
# But I'm not
waiting on a lady

01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:56.965
# I'm just waiting on a friend #

01:23:57.000 --> 01:24:00.000
This place is
a virus you can't shake.

01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:07.000
Sometimes I feel like
I'll never make it home.

01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:11.000
Sometimes I feel as if
you'll never make it home.

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:18.000
- Goodbye, Jane.
- Bye.

01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:35.000
Please, Jane...
He was a good man.

01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:40.000
It may be inappropriate
but now that he's gone,

01:24:40.035 --> 01:24:43.000
- maybe you and I could...
- Please!

01:24:43.035 --> 01:24:45.517
- Not funny.
- Ohh!

01:24:45.552 --> 01:24:48.000
Sorry. I'm only joking.

01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:51.965
Will you find the mother?

01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:55.000
- Zeljko thinks he's found her.
- Zeljko's a gangster.

01:24:55.035 --> 01:24:58.000
I know.
Less trouble at the checkpoints.

01:24:59.000 --> 01:25:03.000
- Why not let me drive, Jane?
- No.

01:25:03.005 --> 01:25:04.000
In the back, Flynn.

01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:09.000
Fucking, fucking door!

01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:48.000
This is it.

01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:09.000
- This is Emira's mother.
- Right.

01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:19.000
She wants you to sit down.

01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:30.000
She knew you were coming.
It was in the beans.

01:26:30.035 --> 01:26:32.000
She knows what I've come for, then.

01:26:32.035 --> 01:26:33.965
To talk about Emira.

01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:38.000
You have said that you will
bring her back after the war.

01:26:38.035 --> 01:26:42.000
Yes, I said that, but...
things have changed since then.

01:26:42.035 --> 01:26:43.965
The orphanage no longer exists.

01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:49.000
Mrs Savic is in hiding.
And Emira is happy where she is.

01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:53.000
She wants to thank you
for helping Emira.

01:26:57.000 --> 01:26:58.000
Mr Henderson...

01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:01.000
I'm her mother. And I'm alone.

01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:06.000
I know I was a bad mother.

01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:11.000
That I gave her up, but I love her.

01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:15.000
Do you understand
why I want her back?

01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:19.000
- Understand?
- Yes.

01:27:19.035 --> 01:27:20.965
Da.

01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:23.000
Yes, I understand.

01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:28.000
But, um...

01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:30.965
Emira... hardly knows you.

01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:33.965
You've seen her twice in eight years.

01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:38.000
- And to be honest...
- I don't translate this.

01:27:38.035 --> 01:27:39.965
I don't translate. You listen.

01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:43.000
I have been listening
and I have things to say.

01:27:43.035 --> 01:27:45.000
- Zeljko, will you translate?
- Wait.

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:52.000
I am giving you Emira
to be your daughter.

01:27:56.000 --> 01:28:00.000
But because I was a bad mother,
I have no memories of her.

01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:03.000
I want to see her...

01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:06.000
To hear her voice.

01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:15.000
Good car, huh?

01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:24.000
How you get money for this car? Mmm?

01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:32.000
It's through here.

01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:39.500
I have a tape of Emira
if Mrs Hodzic wants to see it.

01:28:39.535 --> 01:28:44.000
Would you ask her that?
Ask if she wants to see this?

01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:47.000
Yeah.

01:28:57.000 --> 01:28:59.000
- Can I have these?
- Yes.

01:29:02.000 --> 01:29:04.000
She looks happy there.

01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:09.000
'Right, in there. '

01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:20.000
Hi. It's me. Could you put Emira on?

01:29:20.005 --> 01:29:21.000
Hold on.

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:24.500
- Emira?
- Yes?

01:29:24.535 --> 01:29:26.000
- Telephone.
- OK.

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:34.965
- You OK?
- Yes?

01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:37.965
- It's Michael.
- OK. Yes? Hi.

01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:43.000
Emira? I've got your mother
here. She wants to talk to you.

01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:46.000
- 'Hello. '
- Emira?

01:29:46.035 --> 01:29:49.000
'Hello? Yes?'

01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:51.995
'What do you want?

01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:54.000
'Let me speak to Michael. '

01:29:56.000 --> 01:29:59.000
She cannot understand
what she's talking about.

01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:02.000
Can she speak Bosnian?

01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:08.000
Emira, you have to talk in Bosnian.

01:30:08.005 --> 01:30:09.000
Emira?

01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:32.000
She will sign.

01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:53.000
Stop here, please.

01:30:56.000 --> 01:30:58.000
Henderson - good luck.

01:30:58.005 --> 01:30:59.000
Thank you.

01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:08.965
Don't, don't live under this dream

01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:13.000
that the West will come
and sort this problem out.

01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:18.000
Don't dream dreams.

01:34:34.000 --> 01:34:36.000
# Is it close?

01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:40.965
# Maybe close enough to touch

01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:45.000
# It's what you wanted for so long

01:34:45.035 --> 01:34:48.000
# And soon we'll all be here

01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:53.965
# It is still

01:34:54.000 --> 01:34:58.000
# It's enough that you don't know

01:34:58.035 --> 01:35:02.000
# When all you needed was to care

01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:06.000
# Ladies, never again

01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:12.000
# Are you thoughtful?

01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:16.000
# And are you simple?

01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:21.000
# And are you beautiful?

01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:24.995
# What will you do

01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:28.000
# When it all falls down?

01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:33.965
# What will you do

01:35:34.000 --> 01:35:37.000
# When it all falls down?

01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:45.000
# Let it all fall down

01:35:45.035 --> 01:35:49.000
# Let it all fall down

01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:14.000
# So long ago

01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:19.500
# Is all that you believe

01:36:19.535 --> 01:36:24.000
# It's all about... #

01:37:18.000 --> 01:37:20.000
