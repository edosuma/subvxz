00:24.886 --> 00:26.184
Here you go, darling.

00:27.288 --> 00:28.688
But where are yours?

00:31.092 --> 00:33.823
The magic of Christmas
is a child's making a wish,

00:34.028 --> 00:35.587
and it coming true.

00:36.698 --> 00:38.132
Go ahead, Ayden.

00:38.533 --> 00:41.002
We'll share whatever it is, all right?

00:41.569 --> 00:42.696
All right.

00:46.874 --> 00:48.172
For a kite!

00:50.945 --> 00:52.937
Thank you, thank you!

00:53.314 --> 00:56.443
Well don't thank us.
Thank Father Christmas.

00:59.254 --> 01:00.381
Thank you.

01:29.417 --> 01:31.409
There he is.

01:39.894 --> 01:41.157
Gazared.

01:41.663 --> 01:42.653
Born tall.

01:42.930 --> 01:44.796
Taxes.

01:45.933 --> 01:48.698
I seem to recall after giving
you last year's payment

01:48.803 --> 01:51.136
not all of it reached Lord Rockfort.

01:51.506 --> 01:54.738
And I had men even more foul
than you show at my door.

01:54.876 --> 01:58.210
I'm not to blame, you can imagine.

01:59.147 --> 02:02.242
Do you still from every person
you collect, or just us?

02:03.251 --> 02:07.313
Are you going to give me the payment
or do you need persuading?

02:07.622 --> 02:09.419
I'm not giving you anything.

02:09.991 --> 02:12.893
I shall deliver my payment
to Lord Rockfort himself.

02:13.895 --> 02:17.662
I don't think our lord visits
many men in the dungeon.

02:17.832 --> 02:19.198
Arrest him!

02:34.849 --> 02:36.181
No!

02:37.185 --> 02:38.744
All right!

02:38.820 --> 02:39.913
All right.

02:40.088 --> 02:41.021
Enough.

02:43.257 --> 02:44.589
I'll get the money.

02:45.693 --> 02:46.661
Just don't hurt her.

02:46.728 --> 02:48.890
I wouldn't dream of hurting her.

02:49.464 --> 02:53.060
Not when I can get such a fair price
for another child in the mines.

02:53.167 --> 02:54.692
Get them in the wagon.

02:54.936 --> 02:56.666
No! No!

02:57.739 --> 02:59.332
Ayden, run!

02:59.774 --> 03:00.833
Stop fighting.

03:01.209 --> 03:02.074
Run!

03:04.912 --> 03:06.403
Into the wagon.

03:51.893 --> 03:53.452
Forget the girl.

03:53.795 --> 03:56.731
We'll make 10 times as much
from just one of these dragon eggs.

03:57.899 --> 04:00.300
You, girl. Give us the eggs.

04:00.635 --> 04:02.263
No! I won't!

04:04.672 --> 04:05.662
Come on, girl.

04:15.616 --> 04:18.517
D-d-d-d-dragon!

04:24.125 --> 04:25.388
Ayden!

04:36.370 --> 04:37.463
Get down!

04:39.273 --> 04:40.969
Ayden!

05:00.728 --> 05:02.924
Gazared! Set us free.

05:03.498 --> 05:05.433
Gazared, don't be a coward!

05:07.869 --> 05:09.132
Ayden!

05:10.538 --> 05:11.369
Let's go!

05:16.444 --> 05:17.707
Watch it, watch it!

05:21.749 --> 05:23.615
No! No!

05:40.368 --> 05:41.700
Get away!

05:44.272 --> 05:45.706
Ayden!

05:46.807 --> 05:47.536
No.

05:55.716 --> 05:56.649
She's safe.

06:45.232 --> 06:47.326
I'll get your fresh pickled ginger.

06:59.814 --> 07:00.679
Thank you.

07:11.826 --> 07:15.058
He brandished his sword
to face the ferocious dragon.

07:15.229 --> 07:19.690
The battle was fierce, sword was...

07:19.867 --> 07:24.430
And they battled from sunup until
sundown until finally the dragon fell.

07:24.572 --> 07:26.302
The knight was victorious.

07:26.474 --> 07:28.670
The villagers cheered,
"We love you!"

07:51.265 --> 07:52.699
You'll be safe here.

07:53.267 --> 07:55.827
I brought you some worms, too,
for your wrist.

07:56.671 --> 07:58.833
Stay off of that one until
you feel better.

07:59.073 --> 08:00.871
Where did you learn to do that?

08:00.975 --> 08:03.274
My mother taught me when
I was about your age.

08:06.981 --> 08:08.279
What is it?

08:09.550 --> 08:10.779
Dragons.

08:36.409 --> 08:38.072
No, Come on, we need to go.

08:44.418 --> 08:45.613
Come on, come on.

08:53.127 --> 08:55.221
Wait, wait, wait for us! We're here.

08:56.063 --> 08:56.792
We're here.

08:57.064 --> 08:58.896
Hurry. Hurry!

09:00.034 --> 09:02.299
I would expect you to
take the warning bells

09:02.503 --> 09:04.495
a little more seriously, Ayden.

09:04.605 --> 09:07.336
Especially with what happened
to your parents.

09:07.508 --> 09:08.771
I'm sorry, Sister Lenora.

09:08.943 --> 09:11.071
Now go find the twins and
make sure they're shuttering

09:11.245 --> 09:14.511
the windows properly instead
of hanging out of them.

09:14.782 --> 09:16.512
And bring them down for supper.

09:16.817 --> 09:18.183
- Can you see anything?
- No, I can't.

09:18.285 --> 09:19.719
- Where is it?
- I don't know.

09:19.820 --> 09:22.756
- Scoot over!
- No, you! I can't see.

09:24.925 --> 09:29.260
Would you two knock it off and close
that thing before you get us all cooked?

09:29.530 --> 09:31.522
You're not the boss of us.

09:32.032 --> 09:32.897
Yeah?

09:35.102 --> 09:35.797
Hey!

09:35.903 --> 09:37.428
You could have killed us!

09:38.806 --> 09:40.331
Prepare to die!

09:42.409 --> 09:44.935
Don't be silly, Ayden.
You're safe here.

09:45.112 --> 09:46.740
Talking to yourself again?

09:47.715 --> 09:48.808
No...

09:49.817 --> 09:50.750
I was...

09:50.885 --> 09:53.753
Shouldn't be such a It's very...

09:53.854 --> 09:55.322
Roslyn!

09:56.056 --> 09:57.490
- You were saying?
- Garret.

09:58.526 --> 09:59.789
Don't pick on Ayden.

09:59.927 --> 10:01.862
Sister Lenora says supper's ready.

10:04.098 --> 10:05.532
Hey!

10:19.513 --> 10:21.880
- Oh...
- That is not fair.

10:22.116 --> 10:23.914
The smell is awful!

10:24.185 --> 10:25.983
Finn! Hoyt! What are you doing?

10:28.689 --> 10:29.782
Nothing?

10:30.391 --> 10:33.691
We're just cleaning up for supper.

10:34.528 --> 10:35.689
It's ready.

11:08.829 --> 11:10.058
What is it, Ayden?

11:10.464 --> 11:13.992
Oh. Just your stocking hanging
on the fireplace.

11:14.702 --> 11:17.103
It reminded me of Father Christmas.

11:17.171 --> 11:17.900
Who?

11:18.138 --> 11:19.663
Who's Father Christmas?

11:19.740 --> 11:21.936
- No one but a fairytale.
- That's not true.

11:22.276 --> 11:24.768
He's real, and he's wonderful.

11:25.846 --> 11:26.870
Ayden's right.

11:27.147 --> 11:29.582
Well, at least partially.

11:30.384 --> 11:34.116
Many years ago, even before
Sister Lenora was born,

11:34.622 --> 11:38.684
there was a man named Nicholas
who lived in a village not far from here.

11:39.293 --> 11:41.819
When his neighbors needed money
for their daughter's wedding,

11:41.896 --> 11:44.525
he gifted it to them by dropping
it down their chimney.

11:44.698 --> 11:46.098
So no one would know it was him.

11:46.267 --> 11:47.860
I remember this story.

11:48.435 --> 11:50.631
After seeing how happy
his neighbors were,

11:50.771 --> 11:54.139
he decided that was the way
he wanted to live his life.

11:54.408 --> 11:56.809
Bringing joy to the lives
of other people.

11:56.977 --> 12:00.505
He spent his nights making secret
deliveries to those in need.

12:00.915 --> 12:03.976
And even though helping
grownups was good,

12:04.385 --> 12:07.378
what made Nicholas happiest
was seeing the smiles

12:07.554 --> 12:10.490
on the children's faces
when their wishes came true.

12:10.658 --> 12:12.786
But how did he become
Father Christmas?

12:13.527 --> 12:14.790
Well he started making a list

12:15.029 --> 12:17.021
of all the children that were
good and deserved a present.

12:17.131 --> 12:18.292
Not just in his town,

12:18.432 --> 12:22.301
but in every town he visited.
And soon, the list got so long,

12:22.469 --> 12:24.768
that it took a whole year
to make all the gifts.

12:24.939 --> 12:27.431
And then he chose a special night
to deliver them on.

12:27.908 --> 12:29.035
Christmas.

12:29.109 --> 12:30.577
That sounds familiar.

12:30.811 --> 12:31.779
Is Christmas real?

12:32.446 --> 12:33.106
When is it?

12:33.247 --> 12:35.614
It's real.
It's less than a week away.

12:35.783 --> 12:38.947
And now his list includes
every child in the whole world!

12:39.286 --> 12:40.777
So you'd better be good.

12:42.189 --> 12:45.353
And just how does he travel
around the whole entire world

12:45.492 --> 12:47.825
and visit every child in one night?

12:48.128 --> 12:49.528
He uses magic.

12:49.964 --> 12:50.897
Really.

12:51.966 --> 12:53.662
Well he must have lost it, then.

12:55.970 --> 12:58.667
There haven't been presents
in any stockings for years now.

12:59.740 --> 13:01.368
Isn't that right, Finn?

13:03.010 --> 13:05.502
Why hasn't Father Christmas
been seen in years?

13:05.612 --> 13:07.672
Why haven't we ever had
a Christmas here?

13:08.182 --> 13:10.151
Well maybe it's because
we don't believe.

13:10.684 --> 13:12.653
We need to believe that he'll come.

13:13.020 --> 13:15.615
Make a wish in your heart
for him to answer.

13:16.690 --> 13:19.819
I think it's cruel
that you're getting their hopes up.

13:20.494 --> 13:21.860
I don't want any part of it.

13:29.236 --> 13:31.831
Don't worry. I'll talk to her.

13:35.909 --> 13:37.673
We wish for a...

13:38.112 --> 13:41.514
Make it silent.
So only he can hear it.

13:51.792 --> 13:54.591
We need to show Father Christmas
that we believe.

13:54.728 --> 13:57.789
You don't have to.
He can see it in your heart.

13:59.833 --> 14:01.665
What if we made him something?

14:04.171 --> 14:05.833
We should make him a wreath.

14:06.140 --> 14:07.221
We can hang it on the door,

14:07.274 --> 14:08.914
and that way he'll know
that he's welcome.

14:09.476 --> 14:11.274
Here.
You keep gathering firewood,

14:11.378 --> 14:14.371
and I'm going to look for some
leaves and holly berries.

14:25.292 --> 14:26.351
Hello?

14:30.931 --> 14:32.126
Hello?

14:37.871 --> 14:38.895
Hello?

14:42.476 --> 14:44.377
What are you looking for?

14:44.545 --> 14:46.673
Oh only holly berries and leaves.

14:47.247 --> 14:49.113
Holly berries are poisonous.

14:49.216 --> 14:50.548
They're not for eating.

14:50.751 --> 14:54.153
We're making a wreath.
For Father Christmas.

14:55.489 --> 14:58.550
There is not going to be
a Christmas, child.

14:58.792 --> 15:02.354
Not this year.
Perhaps never again.

15:02.896 --> 15:04.091
How would you know?

15:05.699 --> 15:06.894
Can't you feel it?

15:09.503 --> 15:10.266
It's gone.

15:10.604 --> 15:11.628
What's gone?

15:11.772 --> 15:12.762
The magic.

15:13.874 --> 15:15.274
It's gone out of us.

15:16.076 --> 15:19.774
And all good things are turning bad.

15:23.450 --> 15:24.247
Yes.

15:24.885 --> 15:25.818
I know.

15:27.387 --> 15:28.855
I'm not pretty.

15:29.723 --> 15:31.055
But I once was.

15:33.827 --> 15:35.659
You're... you're an elf?

15:36.029 --> 15:37.520
What happened to you?

15:38.966 --> 15:43.768
There's a darkness in the north.
Father Christmas is dying.

15:44.505 --> 15:47.634
He sent us to find the magic.

15:47.908 --> 15:50.605
But he didn't realize how quickly
the elves were turning...

15:50.777 --> 15:53.804
I only made it
this far because of this.

15:54.748 --> 15:55.875
What is that?

15:56.817 --> 15:58.217
It's a way-stone.

15:59.219 --> 16:00.653
A compass.

16:01.655 --> 16:06.286
It was meant to guide me to the magic,
but instead it led me to you.

16:07.861 --> 16:08.658
Why me?

16:09.763 --> 16:10.662
Ayden!

16:11.465 --> 16:13.457
I don't know.

16:13.700 --> 16:16.033
But I believe
you are meant to have it.

16:17.070 --> 16:18.538
Once you take it,

16:18.872 --> 16:22.331
there will be nothing left
to keep the snow from taking me.

16:22.743 --> 16:24.609
I don't understand. Why...

16:25.812 --> 16:27.212
Follow the compass.

16:27.714 --> 16:29.546
Find the magic.

16:30.250 --> 16:31.650
Save Christmas.

16:31.785 --> 16:35.745
I can't do that.
I can't do it by myself.

16:43.664 --> 16:44.893
Come on, we've got to go!

16:45.232 --> 16:46.097
Why?

16:46.266 --> 16:47.734
- What is it Ayden?
- Come on!

16:56.810 --> 16:57.743
Sorry.

16:57.844 --> 16:59.073
Animals!

16:59.446 --> 17:01.813
Why is everybody always
running in this place?

17:02.849 --> 17:03.646
Ayden!

17:04.952 --> 17:06.318
What is it?

17:06.819 --> 17:08.652
What's wrong?

17:09.388 --> 17:10.755
What is it?

17:11.657 --> 17:12.819
Are you all right?

17:12.992 --> 17:13.833
What's going on here?

17:14.027 --> 17:15.655
I need to make sure
no one's listening.

17:18.832 --> 17:20.698
- What are you doing?
- What's gong on?

17:21.068 --> 17:23.537
Come on, Ayden.

17:23.704 --> 17:24.204
What is it?

17:24.471 --> 17:25.632
Ayden,

17:25.771 --> 17:27.573
- what's going on?
- Tell us what's happening.

17:28.308 --> 17:29.742
As I've told you many times before,

17:29.910 --> 17:33.074
we don't bid them out until
they become of age.

17:33.580 --> 17:36.846
I mean, even orphans
deserve to be children.

17:37.084 --> 17:38.017
All right.

17:38.185 --> 17:39.949
We'll take one before
we leave town tomorrow,

17:40.220 --> 17:42.451
and we'll back for
the other next week.

17:44.725 --> 17:46.626
I have something to show you.

17:50.230 --> 17:51.823
It's important.

17:59.473 --> 18:02.102
So you met a real live elf?

18:02.509 --> 18:03.499
Yes.

18:04.845 --> 18:09.579
And he told you Christmas
wasn't coming back this year.

18:09.750 --> 18:12.413
Well not just this year,
maybe never.

18:12.586 --> 18:15.954
Unless you use this crystal
to find the missing magic?

18:16.156 --> 18:19.558
Well he called it a compass,
but yes.

18:21.862 --> 18:23.660
All right. I'm in.

18:23.897 --> 18:25.889
You really believe me just like that?

18:26.566 --> 18:30.662
I can't think of any better reason why
you'd have a magic glowing rock.

18:32.172 --> 18:33.731
So when so we leave?

18:35.609 --> 18:36.770
You're all crazy!

18:37.811 --> 18:39.746
You really want to get yourself lost

18:39.913 --> 18:43.441
and probably killed over a silly rock?

18:45.385 --> 18:48.753
You know what, you're more
than welcome to do it. Alone.

18:49.856 --> 18:52.587
No one invited you anyways.

18:54.661 --> 18:56.222
We'll leave first thing in the morning.

18:56.563 --> 18:58.930
But before you make your decisions,

18:59.766 --> 19:02.668
I want you to know that this
is not going to be easy.

19:03.670 --> 19:05.468
We're going to be runaways.

19:05.806 --> 19:09.709
We're going to have no money,
no food, no shelter.

19:10.043 --> 19:11.568
All we have is this.

19:12.612 --> 19:14.774
And we don't even know
where it's taking us.

19:15.515 --> 19:17.177
We're going to find the lost magic.

19:17.284 --> 19:18.843
We're going to save Christmas!

19:22.289 --> 19:23.655
Roslyn's right.

19:25.125 --> 19:26.821
You're all crazy.

19:30.897 --> 19:32.331
But of course I'll go.

19:35.869 --> 19:39.362
What are you all up to?

19:52.352 --> 19:53.752
It's almost supper.

19:57.724 --> 19:58.851
Go wash up.

20:26.853 --> 20:27.946
Hoyt,

20:37.631 --> 20:39.327
Did you make past the ogre OK?

20:39.533 --> 20:40.728
Yeah, just barely.

20:40.934 --> 20:41.697
Good.

20:41.868 --> 20:44.133
I don't want to come face
to face with her this early.

20:44.271 --> 20:46.035
Especially with her dragon breath.

20:46.573 --> 20:47.541
Where's Garret?

20:49.075 --> 20:50.907
Come on let's do this.

21:58.178 --> 21:59.407
Coming.

22:01.781 --> 22:02.908
I'm coming.

22:12.526 --> 22:13.653
You're early.

22:14.861 --> 22:16.420
Fetch the boy.

22:18.131 --> 22:20.828
Let me get you something
to drink first.

22:24.704 --> 22:26.138
What are we going to do now?

22:26.806 --> 22:28.104
I know another way.

22:28.575 --> 22:29.543
Follow me.

22:30.944 --> 22:32.810
Don't wake the other children.

22:44.591 --> 22:45.889
It's OVER 30 feet down.

22:46.026 --> 22:47.858
That's why we're not jumping.

23:00.574 --> 23:01.837
Come on come on come on!

23:02.943 --> 23:06.505
Come on, faster!
You're taking too long.

23:08.248 --> 23:09.807
Hurry up, come on!

23:09.950 --> 23:12.044
Hoyt, wait,
I'm not down all the way.

23:16.156 --> 23:18.625
One at a time, you numbskulls.

23:23.196 --> 23:24.789
Ayden. Hurry.

23:30.971 --> 23:32.462
Garret come on.

23:32.973 --> 23:34.771
I can't leave without Roslyn.

23:35.208 --> 23:38.337
I'll buy you time by pulling up the blanket
so they won't know and catch you.

23:38.445 --> 23:40.505
If I don't meet you
by the edge of the woods,

23:41.247 --> 23:42.545
then go on without me.

23:42.749 --> 23:44.377
Garret, no!
We can't go without you!

23:44.551 --> 23:45.917
Yes, you can, Ayden.

23:46.486 --> 23:47.818
You must.

23:48.622 --> 23:49.954
Promise me you will.

23:51.458 --> 23:52.687
Promise.

23:56.696 --> 23:57.720
Garret?

24:00.634 --> 24:02.694
Now go. Hurry!

24:23.023 --> 24:24.082
Where's Garret?

24:24.391 --> 24:25.290
Oh.

24:30.030 --> 24:31.862
He didn't make it out.

24:34.668 --> 24:36.694
He told me we have
to go on without him.

24:37.871 --> 24:39.703
He made me promise.

24:41.408 --> 24:42.671
I understand
if you want to go back...

24:42.809 --> 24:45.210
If it's a choice between
following your magic rock

24:45.378 --> 24:48.507
and facing the wrath of Sister Lenora
and Father Mendel,

24:48.581 --> 24:50.641
I'll take my chances with the rock.

24:52.686 --> 24:54.052
Which way do we go?

25:16.743 --> 25:18.575
I wish I knew where this thing
was taking us.

25:18.745 --> 25:19.644
That's easy.

25:19.713 --> 25:20.772
North.

25:21.581 --> 25:22.708
Well how do you know that?

25:23.016 --> 25:24.177
You can tell by the moss.

25:24.284 --> 25:26.048
It grows on the north side
of the trees.

25:26.352 --> 25:29.345
- Oh, that's pretty handy.
- Yeah. And at night...

25:33.860 --> 25:37.991
It's probably just a squirrel
or something.

25:38.531 --> 25:41.524
Yeah. A squirrel.

25:42.469 --> 25:44.062
But we should stay together,

25:44.938 --> 25:46.304
just in case.

25:59.285 --> 26:01.220
I don't think we're alone
in these woods.

26:03.223 --> 26:04.623
I have an idea.

26:12.899 --> 26:14.731
Anytime now, Finn.

26:22.375 --> 26:23.308
No!

26:29.549 --> 26:30.812
Reveal yourself.

26:33.887 --> 26:35.116
Roslyn?

26:35.755 --> 26:37.018
What are you doing here?

26:37.724 --> 26:39.659
Let me down.

26:39.793 --> 26:42.228
No way. Sister Lenora could
have sent you.

26:42.328 --> 26:43.352
Cut me down!

26:43.496 --> 26:44.725
Is Garret with you?

26:44.864 --> 26:49.234
I am not telling you anything
until you cut me down!

26:52.505 --> 26:54.337
What is wrong with you, Finn?

26:54.507 --> 26:55.702
Nothing's wrong with me.

26:55.975 --> 26:58.501
You're the one who's
stalking us through the woods.

26:58.745 --> 26:59.906
Now where's Garret?

27:02.415 --> 27:03.212
He's not coming.

27:03.383 --> 27:04.715
What do you mean?

27:04.818 --> 27:06.616
- Is he all right?
- No.

27:07.487 --> 27:08.716
He's not all right.

27:09.088 --> 27:11.023
Nothing is all right
right now, Ayden.

27:13.293 --> 27:16.092
We have to get moving.
They're after us.

27:16.663 --> 27:19.633
Not that way.
We're heading north.

27:22.135 --> 27:24.095
Well if you want to go north,
I know a faster way.

27:24.304 --> 27:25.272
The river.

27:25.905 --> 27:28.568
I assume you don't want
anyone following you?

27:28.675 --> 27:31.201
I couldn't imagine running
into anyone worse.

27:33.213 --> 27:37.810
Christmas is only four days away,
so the faster the better.

27:38.818 --> 27:40.946
See? What would you
do without me?

27:42.822 --> 27:43.790
Roslyn?

27:44.824 --> 27:46.019
It's that way.

27:47.260 --> 27:48.159
Oh.

27:50.296 --> 27:54.233
Couldn't imagine Sister Lenora and
Father Mendel ever catching up with us.

28:00.506 --> 28:02.771
This is going to be much
faster than walking.

28:03.176 --> 28:05.202
How did you know this was here?

28:05.912 --> 28:09.610
Garret used to help Old Man Husker
haul his catch from here to the market.

28:10.316 --> 28:12.217
Isn't he going to miss his boat?

28:13.853 --> 28:15.321
Look at this thing.

28:15.788 --> 28:18.824
Hasn't been used in months,
maybe even years.

28:18.825 --> 28:20.760
No one is going to miss it.

28:31.905 --> 28:33.430
Is it lunchtime yet?

28:35.875 --> 28:37.741
It looks like about midday.

28:38.645 --> 28:39.772
What do we have to eat?

28:41.147 --> 28:42.274
Sorry.

28:43.016 --> 28:44.143
I got hungry.

28:45.218 --> 28:46.550
Seriously?

28:47.186 --> 28:49.621
How long did you think
we were going to be out here?

28:50.657 --> 28:51.590
Hey.

28:51.791 --> 28:53.589
What did you bring?

28:54.394 --> 28:56.954
I was in a hurry, OK?

28:57.864 --> 29:01.858
And I thought you would be smart enough
to bring more than just stinky cheese.

29:02.769 --> 29:04.829
You can do a lot with stinky cheese.

29:05.471 --> 29:07.235
Why don't we catch our own lunch?

29:09.876 --> 29:11.139
Good idea, Rand.

29:13.212 --> 29:14.544
You see?

29:14.647 --> 29:17.207
If we all work together
we can make it.

29:26.592 --> 29:28.788
What do you think
we're going to catch?

29:29.329 --> 29:31.025
This way you won't get wet.

29:40.606 --> 29:42.074
There's something in the water.

29:45.545 --> 29:46.342
Rand!

29:46.713 --> 29:47.544
Rand!

30:02.295 --> 30:04.423
It got me! It got me.

30:04.530 --> 30:06.021
Help me! Please!

30:06.132 --> 30:07.532
Something's on me!

30:09.369 --> 30:10.462
Grab on!

30:15.541 --> 30:16.839
Get him in, come on!

30:23.316 --> 30:25.945
Are you all right? What had you?

31:21.207 --> 31:22.698
That was raw.

31:23.009 --> 31:25.740
We traveled much faster than we
would have through your mossy trees.

31:29.749 --> 31:31.718
We should make a fire
and set up camp.

31:31.818 --> 31:32.808
It's gonna be dark soon.

31:32.985 --> 31:35.687
What if a dragon smells our smoke
and comes for us?

31:35.688 --> 31:37.452
I'd welcome some dragon fire.

31:37.590 --> 31:39.691
Dragons always smell smoke.

31:39.692 --> 31:41.820
It's in their noses all the time.

31:42.028 --> 31:44.862
They won't be able to tell our
fire from their own.

31:45.465 --> 31:46.728
Trust me.

31:47.100 --> 31:48.864
We still shouldn't build a fire.

31:49.769 --> 31:51.533
Why are you so scared, Roslyn?

31:51.704 --> 31:54.731
It's not like we've never been
caught and punished before.

32:03.749 --> 32:05.047
How does that thing work,
anyway?

32:05.184 --> 32:08.177
It has to be some kind of magic, right?

32:08.354 --> 32:10.687
My mother said the magic
of Christmas

32:11.023 --> 32:15.757
is a child making a wish
and it coming true.

32:15.862 --> 32:17.228
Mind if I see that?

32:29.342 --> 32:30.571
How did you do that?

32:30.743 --> 32:32.075
I just did what you said.

32:32.211 --> 32:35.875
I have the same Christmas wish
every year, to go on an adventure.

32:36.015 --> 32:39.543
I just thought about how I feel now
that it's finally coming true.

32:40.219 --> 32:41.653
Can we have it now?

32:41.754 --> 32:44.952
Rather not see what happens
after you two make a wish.

32:45.124 --> 32:45.989
Why not?

32:48.861 --> 32:50.693
Actually, you'd better
hold on to that.

32:52.865 --> 32:54.424
Roslyn, what was your wish?

32:56.135 --> 32:57.501
Nothing special.

32:58.371 --> 32:59.566
What about you?

33:00.473 --> 33:03.102
Well mine's not very original.

33:03.209 --> 33:05.110
An orphan wishing for a family.

33:05.178 --> 33:06.806
Welcome to the club.

34:00.433 --> 34:01.298
Roslyn?

34:03.836 --> 34:04.929
What are you doing here?

34:05.104 --> 34:07.335
I was about to ask you
the same question.

34:09.007 --> 34:11.136
I just wanted to see how lost
we really were.

34:14.780 --> 34:16.806
There's something
you're not telling us.

34:17.449 --> 34:19.543
You've been acting really strange.

34:24.389 --> 34:26.052
Why did you come after us?

34:26.792 --> 34:28.693
Did something happen to Garret?

34:31.230 --> 34:32.630
I know he means a lot to you.

34:32.697 --> 34:34.929
You have no idea what
you're talking about.

34:35.835 --> 34:37.531
He would be here if he could.

34:38.371 --> 34:39.703
What does that mean?

34:40.339 --> 34:41.568
It means...

34:43.876 --> 34:45.811
it means the sun's up.
We need to get moving.

34:47.346 --> 34:48.279
Roslyn.

35:45.371 --> 35:47.931
Looks like your magic rock's
been leading us in circles.

35:48.374 --> 35:50.866
We're gonna starve to death
before we even get there.

35:51.110 --> 35:52.908
Hey, I think I found
something up here!

35:55.748 --> 35:57.910
I thought you didn't
believe in Christmas.

35:58.851 --> 36:00.820
At this point I don't know
what to believe.

36:08.494 --> 36:11.623
You need to get your eyes checked.

36:11.764 --> 36:12.823
Why? At least.

36:14.266 --> 36:15.791
Can you smell that?

36:16.168 --> 36:19.900
Fresh baked bread. And bacon!

36:20.773 --> 36:22.332
I'm not going in there.

36:24.543 --> 36:26.569
The crystal says
we go to the tavern.

36:26.779 --> 36:28.077
I agree with Finn.

36:29.515 --> 36:31.746
The compass hasn't
steered us wrong yet.

36:31.984 --> 36:33.213
And I have?

36:33.352 --> 36:34.047
The river.

36:34.787 --> 36:37.689
Wouldn't it be nice to go somewhere
that wasn't crawling with bugs?

36:37.823 --> 36:40.554
I doubt there are any less bugs
in there than there are out here.

36:40.693 --> 36:41.888
But food.

36:42.695 --> 36:45.096
It doesn't look like a very
charitable place, Finn.

36:45.231 --> 36:47.530
How do you imagine
paying for that?

36:48.534 --> 36:49.832
With my good looks.

37:20.232 --> 37:21.860
Get away from here, kids.

37:32.812 --> 37:33.745
What?

37:33.979 --> 37:37.780
We'll have a loaf of your finest bread
and a flagon of water, kind sir.

37:38.617 --> 37:40.449
How do you plan do pay for this?

37:46.091 --> 37:47.616
How about a trade?

37:54.066 --> 37:56.729
Come on, where's
your Christmas spirit?

37:57.703 --> 38:00.104
What, you haven't noticed
my decorations?

38:04.143 --> 38:06.738
That was the last man
that couldn't pay for his meal.

38:06.912 --> 38:07.936
Now scram!

38:11.450 --> 38:14.010
It's all right. There's a here.

38:18.524 --> 38:20.686
Excuse me, sir?

38:21.260 --> 38:23.695
Would you be so kind as to...

38:24.864 --> 38:25.923
I am so sorry.

38:26.131 --> 38:27.972
She thought you looked
just like our uncle did.

38:28.133 --> 38:29.294
Our mistake.

38:30.669 --> 38:33.229
Thanks,
That was about to get ugly.

38:33.372 --> 38:36.365
You mean uglier.
That guy was only pretty ugly.

38:36.542 --> 38:37.339
Get down!

38:39.411 --> 38:40.606
What are you doing?

39:01.667 --> 39:03.192
I know you.

39:07.907 --> 39:08.931
Go go go!

39:40.906 --> 39:43.375
There. There they are.
Behind those tables!

39:47.980 --> 39:48.709
Get out of my way!

39:48.914 --> 39:50.314
Come here. Get over here.

39:52.051 --> 39:54.520
Hey! That's mine, give it back!

39:54.620 --> 39:56.384
Where did you get the Waystone?

39:56.622 --> 39:57.555
Waystone?

39:57.790 --> 39:59.224
That's what the old elf called it.

39:59.325 --> 40:02.591
Now you get me out here, kid,
and it's yours.

40:08.867 --> 40:11.302
Move faster, kid, faster.

40:12.171 --> 40:14.231
There. There's a knife.
There's a knife.

40:14.773 --> 40:15.502
Get one.

40:17.109 --> 40:18.475
Come on kids,

40:19.178 --> 40:19.804
let's go.

40:27.686 --> 40:29.120
Don't let them escape.

40:30.255 --> 40:31.416
Out of the way.

40:31.790 --> 40:32.655
Where'd they go?

40:32.825 --> 40:35.294
Where are those cursed brats?
Look over there!

40:45.504 --> 40:46.665
Hey! Give it back!

40:51.343 --> 40:52.402
Give it...

41:00.252 --> 41:01.220
Stop him!

41:17.736 --> 41:19.500
Hey, wait!

41:21.540 --> 41:23.873
- I need to talk...
- No, Finn, stop!

41:24.143 --> 41:26.078
Go. Go, go, go.

41:29.715 --> 41:32.446
We need to go!
We need to go now.

41:33.252 --> 41:35.653
Excuse me, excuse me.
Could you help us?

41:35.821 --> 41:36.720
Oh sure, hop in.

41:54.707 --> 41:55.834
Come on!

42:31.710 --> 42:33.611
Let go! Get off!

42:35.981 --> 42:39.110
Wait...

42:44.857 --> 42:46.655
They're catching up!

42:46.725 --> 42:48.057
Go faster!

42:48.527 --> 42:49.654
Help me with this.

42:54.833 --> 42:55.732
Apples!

42:55.834 --> 42:56.665
Pass them up here.

43:10.182 --> 43:11.582
Use your slingshot Fin.

43:16.221 --> 43:17.416
Nice shot Finn.

43:17.489 --> 43:20.789
This is good,
this is good. Right here.

43:23.595 --> 43:25.530
Quick, quick, quick!

43:28.467 --> 43:28.797
What is going on?

43:28.967 --> 43:30.833
Not here, come on.

43:32.004 --> 43:34.030
- Thank you.
- Hup!

43:38.243 --> 43:39.142
Stay with them.

43:40.312 --> 43:42.645
- Faster Let's go!...
- Move quickly.

43:42.714 --> 43:48.813
We can't let them get away.

43:50.656 --> 43:53.182
- We need to keep moving.
- No! I want answers.

43:53.292 --> 43:54.760
All in good time.

43:56.128 --> 43:57.391
From you.

44:00.766 --> 44:03.861
Those two are partly responsible
for my parents' deaths.

44:05.771 --> 44:07.171
Do you know them?

44:07.806 --> 44:08.865
No.

44:10.676 --> 44:13.271
Well I mean, not really.

44:13.745 --> 44:16.408
Do you think Sister Lenora
sent them after us?

44:16.782 --> 44:18.546
What do they want with us?

44:18.650 --> 44:19.948
They're bounty hunters.

44:20.085 --> 44:23.613
Oh. So which one of you got today?

44:26.825 --> 44:27.815
It was me.

44:29.795 --> 44:31.423
What? Spit it out!

44:32.731 --> 44:34.495
When you become of age,

44:34.733 --> 44:36.827
you're old enough to become
an apprentice.

44:37.569 --> 44:40.835
Kids with parents usually
pick with much fair.

44:41.874 --> 44:44.708
Kids like us get sold
to the highest bidder.

44:47.713 --> 44:48.737
Garret.

44:50.816 --> 44:53.047
They must have took him
the morning we left.

44:53.685 --> 44:54.846
That's who was there.

44:55.020 --> 44:57.216
And you must have been
the other one on the list.

44:58.257 --> 44:59.953
I heard them talking about it.

45:00.459 --> 45:02.360
They were gonna send me
to the mines.

45:02.794 --> 45:05.059
I... I couldn't stand going,
I had to run away.

45:05.264 --> 45:08.792
Old enough to know
who's of age and who's not.

45:08.934 --> 45:09.993
Why not?

45:10.636 --> 45:11.194
Well let's put it this way.

45:11.470 --> 45:14.929
If those guys catch up to us, they are
not taking you back to the orphanage.

45:15.741 --> 45:19.701
Roslyn, they've been after
you this whole time.

45:20.245 --> 45:21.406
Not us.

45:24.149 --> 45:25.742
I put you all in danger.

45:27.185 --> 45:28.653
I was afraid.

45:30.789 --> 45:34.191
You should have told us.
We never would have left you.

45:36.862 --> 45:38.194
I'm so sorry.

45:38.463 --> 45:40.796
This is all very sweet.

45:41.133 --> 45:42.934
But there is a pack of
ruthless bounty hunters

45:43.068 --> 45:44.331
who would have caught up
to the wagon by now

45:44.503 --> 45:46.631
and noticed that we are not in it.

45:46.939 --> 45:47.736
So.

45:48.006 --> 45:51.499
Unless you want to be really,
really sorry, we need to go.

45:51.910 --> 45:52.775
Now.

45:54.513 --> 45:55.776
Who are you anyway?

46:00.085 --> 46:01.314
I'm Eric.

46:08.727 --> 46:09.820
Let's go.

46:10.228 --> 46:11.196
- Hoyt.
- Good.

46:11.396 --> 46:11.896
Fin.

46:12.097 --> 46:13.121
- Rand.
- Nice to meet you. Pleasure.

46:13.332 --> 46:15.028
- Rosalynne.
- Thank you.

46:35.754 --> 46:38.383
So an elf gave you his Waystone?

46:39.825 --> 46:41.088
Just like that.

46:47.766 --> 46:49.200
Not exactly.

46:50.936 --> 46:55.738
When he gave it to me,
he... changed.

46:56.008 --> 46:57.476
Changed?

46:58.343 --> 46:59.606
Changed how?

47:00.345 --> 47:02.371
I don't know, it was...

47:02.981 --> 47:05.712
it was like he went dark all
of a sudden.

47:06.685 --> 47:07.948
Like...

47:08.086 --> 47:12.581
Like all of the magic
was being drained out of him.

47:17.462 --> 47:19.328
He turned into a goblin.

47:22.667 --> 47:26.695
He told me to follow
the Waystone, and I did.

47:28.373 --> 47:30.774
And it led me to you.

47:35.547 --> 47:37.539
Do you know where the magic is?

47:39.451 --> 47:40.783
I do.

47:42.054 --> 47:44.023
But it's not that simple.

47:44.689 --> 47:45.782
What do you mean?

47:50.595 --> 47:53.895
Father Christmas's magic
comes from an orb

47:54.833 --> 47:57.701
that's cut from the same crystal
as your Waystone.

47:58.870 --> 48:02.705
I used to have it,
but I lost it years ago.

48:02.874 --> 48:06.174
Lost it? But you just said
you knew where it was.

48:07.512 --> 48:11.415
When I say I lost it,
I meant to someone.

48:11.783 --> 48:16.016
Or, in this case, an ogre.

48:17.189 --> 48:20.626
So without this orb thing there's
no chance of saving Christmas?

48:21.793 --> 48:23.819
Well, I know we should
be rationing this,

48:24.029 --> 48:27.329
but if we're going after an ogre,
I'm gonna need my strength.

48:36.374 --> 48:37.899
I think there's a rock in my shoe.

48:38.076 --> 48:39.874
We have bigger things
to worry about.

48:40.812 --> 48:42.405
Much bigger.

48:54.025 --> 48:56.824
I can't believe you survived
a fight with an ogre.

48:58.530 --> 49:02.661
Well, uh, it wasn't really a fight.

49:02.734 --> 49:04.703
What was it then?
A battle of wits?

49:04.836 --> 49:08.705
Please, tell me you didn't lose
to an ogre in a battle of wits.

49:08.773 --> 49:10.708
Actually it was a bet.

49:11.209 --> 49:14.338
Why in the world would
you make a bet with an ogre?

49:14.713 --> 49:16.682
It's a long story. You see...

49:21.153 --> 49:22.451
I have a plan.

49:23.188 --> 49:24.850
Do you know what ogres
like to eat?

49:25.290 --> 49:27.384
Besides children?

49:29.261 --> 49:30.092
Yes.

49:35.567 --> 49:38.230
We're not going to let
the ogre eat that, right?

49:38.403 --> 49:41.669
No. It's a... distraction.

49:46.711 --> 49:47.940
Quiet down, here he comes.

50:00.192 --> 50:02.787
OK. You ready?

50:04.029 --> 50:05.122
Yeah?

50:06.131 --> 50:08.623
Are you gonna remember the signal?
In case he comes back?

50:08.967 --> 50:10.026
I can do it.

50:10.468 --> 50:11.265
OK.

50:28.220 --> 50:29.518
Easy as pie.

50:30.288 --> 50:32.814
I hope that's not what you said
before losing a bet to him.

50:42.767 --> 50:44.793
So what does your stone do?

50:45.704 --> 50:47.764
How's it going to help
bring the magic back?

50:48.506 --> 50:52.910
Well, Father Christmas uses
it to slow down time

50:53.044 --> 50:55.172
so that he can deliver presents.

50:56.314 --> 50:58.579
I mean, how do you think
he did it all in one night?

50:59.084 --> 51:00.814
Will you be able to show us?

51:01.886 --> 51:07.382
Uh... maybe?
There! There, I see it!

51:24.542 --> 51:25.771
Caw!

51:28.246 --> 51:30.215
Was that supposed to be a bird call?

51:30.382 --> 51:31.680
Caw!

51:31.816 --> 51:33.216
This way, this way!

52:29.741 --> 52:30.709
Run!

52:42.587 --> 52:43.782
Hey!

52:45.056 --> 52:46.456
Remember me?

52:48.893 --> 52:49.952
That's nice.

52:51.696 --> 52:53.631
Should we see if they need any help?

53:21.059 --> 53:21.958
Run.

53:27.532 --> 53:29.660
Come on, he won't stay
unconscious forever!

53:29.834 --> 53:32.235
Come on, quickly! Quickly!

53:34.739 --> 53:35.570
Run!

53:35.707 --> 53:36.731
Go!

53:55.660 --> 53:56.787
We made it.

53:57.729 --> 53:58.992
So is that the rock?

53:59.964 --> 54:02.297
Father Christmas uses
it to slow down time.

54:02.700 --> 54:04.740
That's how he deliver all
the presents in one night.

54:05.603 --> 54:06.764
Show us how it works.

54:07.071 --> 54:08.562
Yeah, show us!

54:10.742 --> 54:15.203
Well, I... I don't actually know that
I can make it work.

54:17.449 --> 54:18.781
Why? What's missing?

54:20.084 --> 54:24.215
Well I don't actually know that
it works at all anymore.

54:25.223 --> 54:28.057
Ever since I laid hands on it,
it's been dark.

54:28.726 --> 54:30.592
How did you end up with this thing?

54:31.896 --> 54:34.695
That's a long story.
Look, if it's like Ayden says,

54:34.833 --> 54:37.098
and the elves are turning,
then we don't have much time.

54:38.036 --> 54:40.267
OK? We've got two days to
get this to Father Christmas,

54:40.472 --> 54:42.737
and that's our only chance
of making it work again.

54:43.208 --> 54:45.803
All right, how do
we find Father Christmas?

54:46.945 --> 54:48.880
I was afraid you'd ask that.

54:51.115 --> 54:53.175
I could take you to
the border of the North.

54:53.351 --> 54:55.149
But that's as far as I'm going.

54:56.988 --> 54:58.251
All right.

54:59.023 --> 55:00.184
Come on, then.

55:22.380 --> 55:23.678
Is that a field over there?

55:24.782 --> 55:26.444
Wouldn't that be easier to travel on?

55:26.784 --> 55:28.548
It'd be quicker, yes.

55:29.287 --> 55:33.281
But being out in the open like that
makes us easy lunch for a dragon.

55:35.326 --> 55:36.692
Besides,

55:37.829 --> 55:40.389
in those woods are hunter-bandits.

55:40.865 --> 55:44.734
You think that these woods
are infested with goblins.

55:44.936 --> 55:47.064
Are there?
Goblins in these woods?

55:47.171 --> 55:48.696
In these woods?

55:51.609 --> 55:57.310
No. No, the scariest things
in these woods is us.

56:00.752 --> 56:02.812
He doesn't seem very sure of himself.

56:15.833 --> 56:16.801
They're close.

56:41.259 --> 56:42.158
So.

56:43.528 --> 56:45.656
How do you feel about using
rivers to travel?

56:45.730 --> 56:47.665
It's a good way to hide
your tracks, right?

56:48.666 --> 56:50.100
It seems like it could work.

56:51.502 --> 56:55.132
But there's a lot of foul beasts lurking in
that water who wouldn't think twice

56:55.306 --> 56:58.299
about tearing you into chum.

57:01.846 --> 57:04.008
Ow. Ouch.

57:04.415 --> 57:05.314
What is it?

57:20.365 --> 57:24.200
Ready, aim, fire!

57:26.938 --> 57:28.065
Wait!

57:32.010 --> 57:33.808
Finn! Roslyn! Slow down!

57:37.749 --> 57:40.218
Grant! Wait, what are you...

57:47.191 --> 57:48.819
Finn, wait, where are you going?

58:01.806 --> 58:04.640
They shot this little one down too.

58:07.745 --> 58:08.735
No, don't!

58:18.222 --> 58:19.884
Ayden, it's hurt.

58:20.458 --> 58:22.893
She's an orphan like us now.

58:23.728 --> 58:26.197
If we don't help her, no one will.

58:35.473 --> 58:37.374
This is a bad idea.

58:43.147 --> 58:45.981
We really should be going,
there is nothing we can do.

59:19.851 --> 59:23.913
Those bandits will be here any minute
to make sure that that dragon is dead.

59:25.389 --> 59:28.291
But aren't the bandits too scared
to come into the woods?

59:28.693 --> 59:30.252
What about the goblins?

59:30.495 --> 59:33.329
Yeah, the only problem
is there are no goblins.

59:40.138 --> 59:41.663
Yes. There are.

59:50.248 --> 59:52.547
I think the beast went
down by the river.

01:00:09.867 --> 01:00:10.926
Did you see that?

01:00:17.775 --> 01:00:19.334
Don't be a coward.

01:00:20.378 --> 01:00:21.311
This way.

01:01:10.461 --> 01:01:13.397
Hey! You're no goblin.

01:01:48.499 --> 01:01:51.697
Hey! You! Get over here!

01:02:04.215 --> 01:02:06.741
Don't worry.
They'll be back soon.

01:02:11.389 --> 01:02:12.823
I'll go see what it is.

01:02:20.865 --> 01:02:23.528
Isn't that sweet.

01:02:23.834 --> 01:02:25.496
A girl and her dragon.

01:02:25.937 --> 01:02:28.736
Step aside. This one's mine.

01:02:30.875 --> 01:02:34.277
I shot it down. It's mine to kill.

01:02:36.747 --> 01:02:38.875
Then you'll have to go
through me first.

01:03:36.807 --> 01:03:39.470
Our woods, our dragon.

01:03:45.149 --> 01:03:46.742
Are you a goblin?

01:03:47.985 --> 01:03:49.214
Who are you?

01:03:50.488 --> 01:03:52.548
I was going to ask
you the same thing.

01:03:55.793 --> 01:03:58.490
What are you waiting for?
Get out of here!

01:04:06.804 --> 01:04:09.137
Well it looks like you didn't have
any problems here.

01:04:09.306 --> 01:04:12.674
Well I did run into a little trouble,
but I was able to take care of it.

01:04:12.977 --> 01:04:13.808
With help.

01:04:14.945 --> 01:04:16.504
Found you the herbs you needed.

01:04:17.181 --> 01:04:18.012
Saerwen?

01:04:18.249 --> 01:04:19.376
Oh! Uh!

01:04:21.952 --> 01:04:23.215
That's for leaving.

01:04:23.821 --> 01:04:25.722
- And that is for not saying goodbye.
- OK.

01:04:25.823 --> 01:04:29.817
And that is for stealing
the orb of Borealis.

01:04:30.995 --> 01:04:33.294
Are you gonna beat the rest of us up, too?

01:04:33.964 --> 01:04:34.795
No.

01:04:35.833 --> 01:04:37.802
I only do that to thieves.

01:04:39.537 --> 01:04:42.701
Ayden, do you care
to explain what's going on?

01:04:43.140 --> 01:04:44.540
Who's your new friend?

01:04:44.809 --> 01:04:45.902
This is Saerwen.

01:04:46.010 --> 01:04:48.980
She's one of the elves from the north
trying to find the orb of Borealis,

01:04:49.146 --> 01:04:51.672
which apparently was stolen
from Father Christmas.

01:04:52.183 --> 01:04:53.378
By his son.

01:04:56.454 --> 01:04:57.945
Isn't that right, Eric?

01:04:58.089 --> 01:04:59.557
I didn't do it for me.

01:04:59.857 --> 01:05:01.416
Well it was still pretty selfish.

01:05:01.892 --> 01:05:04.088
You have no idea what's happening
in the north, do you?

01:05:04.261 --> 01:05:06.127
Well I can see that it's not good.

01:05:06.297 --> 01:05:07.731
Well this is the least of it.

01:05:08.232 --> 01:05:09.632
The north is dying.

01:05:10.034 --> 01:05:13.527
The Snall is back and it is huge
and dark and dangerous and wrong.

01:05:13.737 --> 01:05:18.038
And Father Christmas
your father is not doing well.

01:05:19.810 --> 01:05:20.675
Hold on.

01:05:21.178 --> 01:05:23.977
I thought this orb thing was
for delivering presents.

01:05:24.115 --> 01:05:26.311
Now all of a sudden
it's destroying the north?

01:05:26.484 --> 01:05:32.424
Yeah, I... I may not have been
completely honest about its powers.

01:05:32.823 --> 01:05:34.689
Well that is the understatement
of the century.

01:05:35.292 --> 01:05:37.488
When connected
to Father Christmas's staff,

01:05:37.661 --> 01:05:40.324
the orb makes time in
the north run constantly slower.

01:05:40.498 --> 01:05:43.730
It has to for the north to function.

01:05:44.034 --> 01:05:46.435
Is that why Father Christmas
has lived for so long?

01:05:46.537 --> 01:05:47.470
Yes.

01:05:48.139 --> 01:05:50.370
And it also helps us keep
the Snall at bay.

01:05:50.774 --> 01:05:54.768
With the power to control time,
it can pretty much do anything.

01:05:54.945 --> 01:05:56.470
No, it can't.

01:05:58.549 --> 01:05:59.539
Eric.

01:05:59.984 --> 01:06:04.752
You know that the orb can slow down time
and sometimes even stop it at nothing.

01:06:04.989 --> 01:06:06.457
Not even the orb can reverse it.

01:06:06.590 --> 01:06:08.650
Yeah, but he didn't even try.

01:06:08.826 --> 01:06:11.295
Someone had to try.

01:06:13.430 --> 01:06:14.489
For her.

01:06:15.232 --> 01:06:16.063
Who?

01:06:20.004 --> 01:06:21.495
Eric's mother died.

01:06:22.173 --> 01:06:23.539
Five years ago.

01:06:24.775 --> 01:06:27.745
He stole the orb to
turn back time and save her.

01:06:32.550 --> 01:06:33.518
Look.

01:06:38.255 --> 01:06:42.852
You know that I never
meant for any of this to happen.

01:06:44.929 --> 01:06:47.262
I would never do
anything to hurt you.

01:06:48.699 --> 01:06:50.793
Don't ever leave without
saying goodbye again.

01:06:53.137 --> 01:06:54.730
Glad you came back.

01:06:55.306 --> 01:06:56.672
But there isn't much time.

01:06:57.474 --> 01:06:59.807
Even now it may be too late
to save Christmas.

01:07:03.514 --> 01:07:04.709
We've failed.

01:07:09.153 --> 01:07:10.746
There's still a chance, Ayden.

01:07:11.455 --> 01:07:14.152
But we must return the
orb back to Father Christmas.

01:07:17.828 --> 01:07:19.797
I was afraid you'd say that.

01:07:39.783 --> 01:07:43.720
I know it hurts, but this will help
your wing heal faster.

01:07:45.856 --> 01:07:47.552
What are we going to do with her?

01:07:48.692 --> 01:07:49.887
We're keeping her.

01:07:52.429 --> 01:07:55.524
She's not gonna be able to travel
very far until her wings heal.

01:07:55.666 --> 01:07:56.690
We can't wait.

01:07:57.368 --> 01:07:58.802
Tomorrow is Christmas eve.

01:07:58.936 --> 01:08:00.666
We can take her with us.

01:08:01.572 --> 01:08:04.132
Dragons are meant to fly,
not walk.

01:08:04.575 --> 01:08:06.339
She would never make it
in the snow.

01:08:07.044 --> 01:08:10.071
What is so bad about
this Snall thing?

01:08:10.214 --> 01:08:11.944
You'll find out soon enough.

01:08:12.716 --> 01:08:15.413
I don't like the sound of that at all.

01:08:16.420 --> 01:08:17.819
We should get some sleep.

01:08:19.156 --> 01:08:20.818
We're going to need our rest.

01:08:38.809 --> 01:08:40.470
You'll be safe here.

01:08:40.810 --> 01:08:42.812
You have plenty of food and water.

01:08:42.813 --> 01:08:44.372
Stay off that wing.

01:08:45.616 --> 01:08:47.608
Even though it's healing fast,
no flying.

01:08:47.751 --> 01:08:48.979
You need your rest.

01:08:52.488 --> 01:08:53.479
Don't worry.

01:08:54.325 --> 01:08:56.453
You've created a sacred
bond with her.

01:08:56.794 --> 01:08:59.286
And you will always
be able to find.

01:09:04.234 --> 01:09:05.497
All set to go?

01:09:09.740 --> 01:09:13.336
We're going north. Catch up
with us when you can.

01:10:55.846 --> 01:10:57.678
I don't remember it being quite so...

01:10:57.781 --> 01:10:58.339
Dark?

01:10:58.649 --> 01:10:59.514
Creepy?

01:10:59.750 --> 01:11:01.651
Terrifying beyond all belief?

01:11:01.852 --> 01:11:03.650
I was going to say big, but.

01:11:05.022 --> 01:11:06.684
I told you it was bad.

01:11:07.458 --> 01:11:09.256
And all this in a few years.

01:11:09.493 --> 01:11:11.359
It's gotten worse as time goes on.

01:11:11.795 --> 01:11:15.664
With no elves left to cut it back,
it's gone dark and wild.

01:11:21.738 --> 01:11:24.469
Are you sure it's a good idea
for you to go in there?

01:11:24.975 --> 01:11:27.308
Going through the only
way to the north now.

01:11:27.711 --> 01:11:29.407
We have no other choice.

01:11:55.572 --> 01:11:57.438
Do you have the feeling
we're being watched?

01:11:58.876 --> 01:12:02.677
This way.
There is something back there.

01:12:03.046 --> 01:12:04.275
Goblins.

01:12:05.115 --> 01:12:07.584
They're gathering,
closing in on us.

01:12:07.751 --> 01:12:09.720
I've never met a full-blown
goblin before,

01:12:09.853 --> 01:12:14.257
but deep down they're
still elves. Right?

01:12:15.292 --> 01:12:17.090
The Snall makes us
forget who we are.

01:12:17.628 --> 01:12:19.824
I feel it pulling on me.

01:12:21.832 --> 01:12:23.232
So what do we do?

01:12:24.301 --> 01:12:25.826
We need to stay together.

01:12:31.975 --> 01:12:32.965
What do we do?

01:12:34.745 --> 01:12:35.678
Run!

01:12:36.780 --> 01:12:38.544
OK follow the twins,
I'll take Finn!

01:12:38.715 --> 01:12:40.675
- What about the girls?
- They'll be fine, now go!

01:12:56.700 --> 01:12:58.692
Hey! Oh!

01:12:59.803 --> 01:13:01.135
A little help here?

01:13:10.814 --> 01:13:11.782
Take this!

01:13:12.749 --> 01:13:13.773
Finn!

01:13:14.751 --> 01:13:15.741
Finn!

01:13:17.588 --> 01:13:18.556
Finn!

01:13:20.057 --> 01:13:21.081
Behind you!

01:13:25.896 --> 01:13:26.920
Roslyn!

01:13:27.564 --> 01:13:28.725
Let go of my friend!

01:13:34.404 --> 01:13:35.428
Go, go!

01:13:40.811 --> 01:13:42.677
Hurry! Quickly!

01:13:47.417 --> 01:13:50.387
Go! Go!

01:14:03.433 --> 01:14:04.696
Get down!

01:14:11.908 --> 01:14:12.705
Let's go!

01:14:16.780 --> 01:14:18.408
I've got you.

01:14:25.789 --> 01:14:27.724
- What's wrong with...
- Not sure.

01:14:27.791 --> 01:14:28.690
Saerwen?

01:14:29.292 --> 01:14:32.956
It's this place.
Eric? Get me out of here.

01:15:27.284 --> 01:15:27.614
Eric.

01:15:27.784 --> 01:15:30.720
Look. You have to fight,
you have to fight it.

01:15:31.421 --> 01:15:33.856
I can't. I'm out of time.

01:16:06.656 --> 01:16:08.818
And I thought you needed me.

01:16:12.062 --> 01:16:13.257
We need you.

01:16:18.668 --> 01:16:20.159
No, don't leave me.

01:16:21.104 --> 01:16:24.973
Don't leave me,
we need you! I need you.

01:16:26.109 --> 01:16:27.475
I need you.

01:16:32.549 --> 01:16:33.608
Please.

01:16:35.051 --> 01:16:36.451
Please.

01:16:59.609 --> 01:17:02.477
You did it. You used the orb.

01:17:11.221 --> 01:17:12.985
Disgusting.

01:17:19.062 --> 01:17:20.530
There's hope yet.

01:17:21.531 --> 01:17:24.194
If we can get the orb back
to Father Christmas in time.

01:17:24.734 --> 01:17:27.898
But the sun is already setting.
It's Christmas Eve.

01:17:34.377 --> 01:17:35.743
Wow.

01:17:38.815 --> 01:17:42.252
I see the end of the Snarl!
Follow us!

01:17:44.988 --> 01:17:46.752
What are we waiting for?

01:17:56.867 --> 01:17:58.301
Thank you!

01:18:11.815 --> 01:18:15.513
This is
where Father Christmas lives?

01:18:16.152 --> 01:18:18.144
It didn't always look like this.

01:18:22.459 --> 01:18:23.620
Are you ready?

01:18:37.107 --> 01:18:38.632
I just want to warn you.

01:18:39.209 --> 01:18:41.178
You're not going
to like what you see.

01:19:58.755 --> 01:19:59.745
Father?

01:20:09.766 --> 01:20:10.893
Father.

01:20:14.771 --> 01:20:18.503
He's still alive, he's just... old?

01:20:21.644 --> 01:20:24.546
It was only the magic of the orb
that kept his body young.

01:20:24.814 --> 01:20:28.410
Without it, he's just
a thousand-year-old man.

01:20:40.697 --> 01:20:41.824
Father.

01:20:43.466 --> 01:20:45.492
I've brought back the orb.

01:20:47.270 --> 01:20:49.739
You can save Christmas.

01:20:56.413 --> 01:20:57.574
Come on, children.

01:20:58.581 --> 01:21:00.140
Let's give them some time alone.

01:21:15.532 --> 01:21:19.628
Father, I know how
angry you must be.

01:21:21.004 --> 01:21:26.875
Yet I know that there is nothing
I can say to fix the damage I have done.

01:21:31.314 --> 01:21:33.408
But I am sorry.

01:22:15.258 --> 01:22:16.692
Here's our last hope.

01:22:22.832 --> 01:22:25.825
At least I get to spend
my last Christmas with you.

01:22:29.873 --> 01:22:32.308
I can't believe we came all
this way for nothing!

01:22:32.709 --> 01:22:34.200
We can't just give up.

01:22:36.746 --> 01:22:38.339
There's nothing else to do.

01:22:39.849 --> 01:22:41.408
And it's all my fault.

01:22:41.985 --> 01:22:43.920
Christmas is lost forever.

01:22:44.154 --> 01:22:45.747
No, it can't be lost!

01:22:45.889 --> 01:22:48.222
If we give up, then it really is lost.

01:22:50.260 --> 01:22:52.957
But we already know that
the magic... it's not completely gone.

01:22:53.096 --> 01:22:54.655
Maybe not yet,

01:22:54.864 --> 01:22:58.096
but without a whole lot of magic,
Father Christmas won't ever wake up.

01:22:59.569 --> 01:23:02.767
Our... our Christmas wishes!
Rand, Hoyt!

01:23:03.072 --> 01:23:04.665
We got our dragon.

01:23:05.542 --> 01:23:06.737
I never told you,

01:23:07.710 --> 01:23:11.112
but my wish was to be free from the life
that would have been forced onto me.

01:23:12.782 --> 01:23:14.614
And I guess that came true, too.

01:23:15.885 --> 01:23:18.821
I can't imagine those goons
finding me all the way up here.

01:23:20.156 --> 01:23:23.092
And I guess my wish
came true a long time ago.

01:23:23.593 --> 01:23:24.788
What was that?

01:23:25.495 --> 01:23:26.485
A family.

01:23:31.534 --> 01:23:32.661
I don't know.

01:23:33.736 --> 01:23:36.638
I mean even with all
those wishes look.

01:23:37.540 --> 01:23:39.304
My father hasn't stirred.

01:23:40.176 --> 01:23:41.337
Not yet.

01:23:42.545 --> 01:23:44.377
But they're right about the wishes.

01:23:44.581 --> 01:23:46.482
Who knows how many it will take.

01:23:47.150 --> 01:23:49.779
But look how powerful mine
was in the Snarl.

01:23:51.688 --> 01:23:54.180
When did your wish come true
in the Snarl?

01:23:54.857 --> 01:23:56.849
When you said you needed me.

01:24:03.299 --> 01:24:04.699
All right, Ayden.

01:24:05.134 --> 01:24:06.261
I believe.

01:24:07.804 --> 01:24:09.363
What's the plan?

01:24:14.544 --> 01:24:16.740
Eric! Get the list from your father.

01:24:16.846 --> 01:24:19.406
Rand, Hoyt, Finn, go help
Saerwen get the presents.

01:24:19.582 --> 01:24:21.175
Roslyn, you're with me.

01:25:11.868 --> 01:25:15.168
But, wait. How are we gonna pull
the sleigh without magic?

01:25:19.609 --> 01:25:21.305
Are you sure this thing
is gonna work?

01:25:21.577 --> 01:25:26.140
No, but it's not impossible
to imagine that it might.

01:25:26.749 --> 01:25:29.150
That's everything.
It's now or never.

01:25:29.686 --> 01:25:32.918
All right, dragon.
On the count of three.

01:25:33.589 --> 01:25:34.352
One.

01:25:35.825 --> 01:25:36.815
Two.

01:25:37.727 --> 01:25:38.751
Three!

01:25:43.366 --> 01:25:44.664
It's all right!

01:25:45.535 --> 01:25:46.730
You can go.

01:26:11.394 --> 01:26:12.555
Fire!

01:26:16.165 --> 01:26:17.690
Is everybody all right?

01:26:19.102 --> 01:26:20.035
Roslyn!

01:26:22.805 --> 01:26:23.829
The presents!

01:26:24.774 --> 01:26:26.743
Tell her we need to go higher!

01:26:26.809 --> 01:26:29.404
Higher! We need to go higher!

01:26:47.263 --> 01:26:48.731
Merry Christmas to you, too!

01:27:24.934 --> 01:27:26.402
Once all the presents are delivered,

01:27:26.536 --> 01:27:29.233
we'll ring the town bell and everyone
will be able to wake up to their gifts.

01:27:29.338 --> 01:27:30.863
With that many Christmas
wishes coming true,

01:27:31.007 --> 01:27:33.101
there'll be enough magic
to save Christmas for good.

01:27:34.710 --> 01:27:36.508
- Eveline and Violet Ashwater.
- OK.

01:27:37.246 --> 01:27:38.214
Larson Pike.

01:27:39.382 --> 01:27:41.010
Pansy and Penny Brooks.

01:27:52.028 --> 01:27:53.792
Christian Andrews.

01:27:55.031 --> 01:27:56.192
Amora Brielle.

01:29:23.953 --> 01:29:25.717
Who is out of bed?

01:29:27.790 --> 01:29:30.191
Hoyt? Rand?

01:29:30.860 --> 01:29:33.828
Oh, where have you been?
I have been worried sick.

01:29:33.829 --> 01:29:36.663
- We went to the north.
- To find Father Christmas.

01:29:37.867 --> 01:29:39.733
There is no Father Christmas.

01:29:43.172 --> 01:29:46.233
- This is yours.
- This one's for you.

01:29:52.181 --> 01:29:54.309
I've always wanted one.

01:29:55.484 --> 01:29:57.043
H... how did you know?

01:29:57.219 --> 01:30:00.451
It's not from us. It's from him.

01:30:02.224 --> 01:30:05.388
This is just like
the one my mother had.

01:30:17.807 --> 01:30:19.469
All the gifts have been delivered.

01:30:19.609 --> 01:30:22.272
It's up to Ayden and the
twins now. To ring the bell.

01:30:22.712 --> 01:30:24.271
I'll go see what's keeping her.

01:30:38.628 --> 01:30:39.687
We need to hurry.

01:30:39.795 --> 01:30:42.629
- There it is, get the dragon!
- Come on!

01:30:42.765 --> 01:30:43.425
What is it?

01:30:43.633 --> 01:30:45.693
The dragon!
I... I have to go help him.

01:30:45.768 --> 01:30:47.100
You two go on without me.

01:30:56.979 --> 01:30:58.277
Rand?

01:31:00.750 --> 01:31:01.945
Rand?

01:31:07.923 --> 01:31:09.152
Ayden?

01:31:13.129 --> 01:31:14.427
Rand? Hoyt?

01:31:19.735 --> 01:31:21.431
Where's their Christmas spirit?

01:31:21.570 --> 01:31:25.701
Well, angry mobs aren't exactly
known for their good will.

01:31:30.713 --> 01:31:31.737
Step aside.

01:31:32.348 --> 01:31:33.976
You're gonna have to kill us first.

01:31:34.250 --> 01:31:36.116
Yeah, what he said.

01:31:36.485 --> 01:31:39.512
- So be it.
- No! Stop!

01:31:40.156 --> 01:31:43.149
Out of the way, girl.
This dragon is made for us to kill.

01:31:43.325 --> 01:31:46.887
There's no need for violence.
It's Christmas.

01:31:47.129 --> 01:31:49.621
Christmas or not, that's a dragon.

01:31:49.699 --> 01:31:50.792
- Yeah!
- Yeah.

01:31:51.067 --> 01:31:53.730
I know all too well about
the danger of dragons.

01:31:54.270 --> 01:31:56.637
It was a dragon that took
my parents from me.

01:31:57.673 --> 01:31:59.904
But I was able to look past my fear.

01:32:00.543 --> 01:32:02.671
If we don't hurt them,
they won't hurt us.

01:32:04.447 --> 01:32:08.509
It's just a young dragon.
It's an orphan. Like me.

01:32:12.288 --> 01:32:13.722
Rand? Hoyt?

01:32:25.267 --> 01:32:26.326
Thank you.

01:32:26.769 --> 01:32:27.862
Ring the bell!

01:32:33.809 --> 01:32:36.108
Well, well, well.

01:32:36.545 --> 01:32:39.674
Looks like our Christmas
wish came true.

01:32:40.149 --> 01:32:44.416
Are you going to come along quietly,
or do you need persuading?

01:32:49.792 --> 01:32:53.229
It's a young dragon now.
But the dragons grow up.

01:32:53.395 --> 01:32:55.697
- Yeah!
- And then what? I Yeah.

01:32:55.698 --> 01:33:00.864
Christmas is about forgiving,
and understanding.

01:33:01.470 --> 01:33:05.305
It reminds us to think of others
instead of ourselves.

01:33:05.508 --> 01:33:08.706
This dragon saved our lives,

01:33:09.311 --> 01:33:11.109
and it helped us deliver Christmas.

01:33:11.347 --> 01:33:14.579
What Christmas?
There is no Christmas anymore!

01:33:14.817 --> 01:33:15.807
Yeah!

01:33:19.221 --> 01:33:20.712
You have to let her go.

01:33:21.490 --> 01:33:23.220
If someone doesn't ring that bell,

01:33:23.325 --> 01:33:25.885
there will never be another
Christmas ever again.

01:33:26.328 --> 01:33:30.629
Christmas.
That's just a story for kids.

01:33:30.933 --> 01:33:34.700
Roslyn's too old to believe in
that nonsense, isn't that right?

01:33:35.137 --> 01:33:38.767
If I let her go she'd just
run away to save herself.

01:33:41.410 --> 01:33:43.140
Let us go and you'll find out.

01:33:59.228 --> 01:34:01.697
You're going to need
two hands to ring that bell.

01:34:02.331 --> 01:34:06.996
So what'll it be?
Save yourself or save Christmas.

01:34:07.136 --> 01:34:10.436
Roslyn. You have to believe.

01:34:13.909 --> 01:34:18.404
Just ring the bell and you're mine.

01:34:30.659 --> 01:34:31.683
Let her go!

01:35:20.876 --> 01:35:22.469
Grandfather,

01:35:22.945 --> 01:35:25.710
Grandfather, look! For Christmas!

01:35:39.495 --> 01:35:40.554
We did it.

01:35:40.829 --> 01:35:42.855
This might actually work.

01:35:46.235 --> 01:35:48.136
There's the rest of them.

01:35:51.006 --> 01:35:52.702
Let go of them now.

01:35:53.776 --> 01:35:56.746
My, oh my.
This little one has spirit.

01:35:56.845 --> 01:35:57.869
You.

01:35:58.914 --> 01:36:01.713
You're the reason
my mother and father are dead.

01:36:01.951 --> 01:36:04.216
It's because of you that
I'm an orphan.

01:36:06.422 --> 01:36:11.451
Yes. I remember.
You cost me a lot that day.

01:36:11.527 --> 01:36:14.395
I lost some good men
and a good wagon.

01:36:14.530 --> 01:36:18.797
- Time to repay me for all the troub...
- She is not going anywhere.

01:36:19.068 --> 01:36:20.798
If you try to to take her,

01:36:21.070 --> 01:36:23.699
that dragon will burn you
to the ground.

01:36:26.875 --> 01:36:29.538
Well that can't happen, can it?

01:36:29.712 --> 01:36:32.739
A good dragon is a dead dragon.

01:36:55.738 --> 01:36:59.300
- Oh, dear me! Father Christmas?
- Can it really be him?

01:36:59.475 --> 01:37:00.841
Father Christmas?

01:37:01.777 --> 01:37:03.109
Gazared.

01:37:03.712 --> 01:37:04.941
Born tall.

01:37:05.814 --> 01:37:09.410
Untie those children
and release them to me.

01:37:09.685 --> 01:37:10.584
Listen, old man.

01:37:10.753 --> 01:37:14.849
We've paid for the girl and we're
already several days past her delivery.

01:37:15.591 --> 01:37:17.492
The rest we're taking for our trouble.

01:37:17.659 --> 01:37:22.097
The only thing you'll be getting,
Gazared, grim grace's justice.

01:37:22.464 --> 01:37:24.933
And you barely deserve that much.

01:37:25.467 --> 01:37:28.164
For your treachery, your thievery,

01:37:28.270 --> 01:37:34.232
your dishonesty, and, most despicably,
your attack on these children,

01:37:34.777 --> 01:37:37.779
I find you guilty,
and sentence you...

01:37:37.780 --> 01:37:41.239
To what?
What are you going to do?

01:37:41.817 --> 01:37:44.343
You are both banished.

01:37:45.154 --> 01:37:51.492
Leave this land and never,
ever, ever return.

01:37:51.693 --> 01:37:53.025
And if we do?

01:37:53.295 --> 01:37:54.854
You'll have to deal with us.

01:37:55.731 --> 01:37:57.063
All of us.

01:37:57.166 --> 01:37:58.657
Yeah!...

01:38:20.089 --> 01:38:23.389
Father. Father,
I know how angry you must be.

01:38:23.459 --> 01:38:27.396
Here. It's all right.
All is forgiven.

01:38:34.436 --> 01:38:38.339
Thank you for finding my son.
And bringing him home.

01:38:38.707 --> 01:38:40.300
It wasn't me who found him.

01:38:41.176 --> 01:38:42.735
It was these children.

01:38:44.780 --> 01:38:51.186
Rand, Hoyt, Roslyn, Finn,
Ayden. My sincerest thanks.

01:38:51.553 --> 01:38:54.148
I will not forget
what you've done for me.

01:38:55.124 --> 01:38:56.786
Saerwen, Eric.

01:38:57.059 --> 01:38:59.961
Make sure Gazared
and Born tall have left for good.

01:39:00.295 --> 01:39:02.855
I'll see to it that these
children get back home.

01:39:11.673 --> 01:39:13.369
What's wrong, child?

01:39:13.976 --> 01:39:15.569
Don't you want to go?

01:39:16.245 --> 01:39:17.804
I just thought after all this,

01:39:17.980 --> 01:39:20.415
we wouldn't have to go back
to the orphanage.

01:39:20.949 --> 01:39:22.645
That's not your home anymore.

01:39:23.986 --> 01:39:26.717
Your home is with me now.

01:39:27.689 --> 01:39:29.658
For as long as you want.

01:39:29.858 --> 01:39:31.793
And that goes for
the rest of you, too.

01:39:32.394 --> 01:39:35.796
I'm sure we can find five beds
for the rest of you to sleep in.

01:39:49.745 --> 01:39:51.145
Father Christmas?

01:39:52.247 --> 01:39:54.182
Can I have one more
Christmas wish?

01:39:54.616 --> 01:39:58.712
Yes, we can pick up
Garret along the way.

01:40:09.298 --> 01:40:10.322
There they are!

01:40:12.467 --> 01:40:14.028
Don't hurt them,
just give them a scare.

01:40:14.136 --> 01:40:15.900
Hold on!

01:41:03.685 --> 01:41:04.653
Family

01:41:05.187 --> 01:41:07.713
is what's most important in life.

01:41:09.725 --> 01:41:12.354
Be it formed of blood or of bond.

01:41:13.228 --> 01:41:15.390
When someone joins a family,

01:41:15.464 --> 01:41:17.933
they are bound together forever.

01:41:18.734 --> 01:41:20.100
They come to our rescue

01:41:20.769 --> 01:41:22.670
when we need it the most.

01:41:24.773 --> 01:41:25.968
With family,

01:41:27.075 --> 01:41:29.704
we have our saddest moments,

01:41:31.213 --> 01:41:34.115
but also our happiest.

01:41:36.351 --> 01:41:40.118
Family is one
of God's greatest gifts to us.

01:41:40.756 --> 01:41:42.486
We must honor it,

01:41:42.824 --> 01:41:45.055
with all our heart,
throughout our life.

01:41:47.629 --> 01:41:50.064
And so, Saerwen,

01:41:52.034 --> 01:41:53.502
with great joy,

01:41:53.669 --> 01:41:55.831
you are hereby joined

01:41:55.937 --> 01:41:57.906
with our family.

01:42:02.577 --> 01:42:05.809
Don't just stand there, boy.
Kiss the girl.
