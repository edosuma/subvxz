WEBVTT

00:00.724 --> 00:03.459
Is that a menacing lion
I see over there?

00:03.527 --> 00:04.860
Or maybe just
an angry squirrel.

00:04.929 --> 00:06.462
Okay, got it.

00:06.530 --> 00:07.707
Your boyfriend's
a big chicken.

00:07.731 --> 00:08.997
Hilarious.
Oh, no.

00:09.066 --> 00:10.466
Are there chickens
out here, too?

00:10.534 --> 00:12.167
It's snakes I'm
worried about, okay?

00:12.236 --> 00:13.836
Not lions, not tigers...

00:13.904 --> 00:16.071
Snakes in the middle
of winter?

00:16.140 --> 00:17.673
Why not? They're
cold-blooded.

00:17.741 --> 00:20.676
Which is why they're dormant:
not enough sun

00:20.744 --> 00:21.944
to warm them up.

00:22.012 --> 00:23.572
This is ninth grade
earth science, babe.

00:23.614 --> 00:25.258
- I guess I slept through that...
- Oh, my God!

00:25.282 --> 00:26.548
Nice try.

00:26.617 --> 00:28.317
Whoa.

00:28.385 --> 00:29.451
What the hell?

00:29.520 --> 00:31.386
Joe, get up!

01:05.956 --> 01:08.257
I swear, McGee, your case
summaries read like a good book.

01:08.325 --> 01:09.725
Thank you.

01:09.793 --> 01:11.538
I try and do more than
"just the facts, ma'am."

01:11.562 --> 01:14.429
This one is
a real page-turner.

01:14.498 --> 01:17.166
It's got mood,
intrigue, emotion.

01:17.234 --> 01:18.901
And that typo.

01:18.969 --> 01:20.669
That or you flat-out
misspelled the word.

01:20.738 --> 01:22.404
Either way, I caught it.

01:22.473 --> 01:23.372
And what word is that?

01:23.440 --> 01:24.606
"Weather."
As in:

01:24.675 --> 01:26.275
"Our agents did their best

01:26.343 --> 01:27.743
to <i>whether</i> the storm."

01:27.811 --> 01:30.379
I see it.
You spelled it W-H,

01:30.447 --> 01:32.614
"whether or not."

01:32.683 --> 01:34.049
When in fact
it should be

01:34.118 --> 01:37.085
W-E, as in, like:
"How's the weather?"

01:37.154 --> 01:40.589
Or as in: "I doubt <i>whether</i>
anyone would care either way."

01:40.658 --> 01:43.125
I care. I'm not
just anyone.

01:43.194 --> 01:44.404
There is
a third spelling.

01:44.428 --> 01:46.595
W-E-T-H,

01:46.664 --> 01:49.565
like in "bellwether,"
which means a castrated ram.

01:49.633 --> 01:53.202
And why would anyone say:
"We'll castrated ram the storm"?

01:53.270 --> 01:56.104
Uh, just pointing out the
nuances of the English language.

01:56.173 --> 01:57.806
I've got some nuance for you.

01:57.875 --> 01:59.675
Grab your gear.
Dead petty officer,

01:59.743 --> 02:00.876
Great Falls Park.

02:00.945 --> 02:02.110
What is a bellwether?

02:02.179 --> 02:04.179
Well, a "wether" is
a ram that leads

02:04.215 --> 02:05.280
a flock of sheep

02:05.349 --> 02:06.281
with a bell around its neck.

02:06.350 --> 02:07.350
It's a bellwether.

02:07.384 --> 02:10.151
- Ah, got it.
- Okay, cool.

02:10.221 --> 02:12.321
Don't even ask, boss.

02:16.126 --> 02:19.595
Victim is Petty Officer
Third Class Logan Braddish,

02:19.663 --> 02:22.464
currently listed as U.A.
from his base in Norfolk.

02:22.533 --> 02:23.932
What was he doing
way out here?

02:24.001 --> 02:25.467
And what tore him
up like that?

02:25.536 --> 02:26.536
Give me a guess,
Palmer.

02:26.604 --> 02:28.303
There's a lot
of little postmortem bites

02:28.372 --> 02:29.605
from much smaller animals,

02:29.673 --> 02:31.139
but his throat and abdomen

02:31.208 --> 02:33.775
were clearly ripped up
by something much larger.

02:33.844 --> 02:36.345
Well, park rangers have
had black bear sightings

02:36.413 --> 02:38.058
- over the past few years.
- Except black bears

02:38.082 --> 02:39.648
aren't known to attack people.

02:39.717 --> 02:40.916
Could have been wolves.

02:40.985 --> 02:42.084
Or coyotes.

02:42.152 --> 02:43.085
In <i>these</i> woods?

02:43.153 --> 02:44.486
- Mm.
- No way.

02:44.555 --> 02:46.121
Oh, got something here.

02:46.190 --> 02:47.990
- Bishop.
- Hmm?

02:48.058 --> 02:49.358
Oh.

02:50.261 --> 02:51.526
That's a claw.

02:51.595 --> 02:53.262
Sure is.
Uh, could I have

02:53.330 --> 02:54.496
an evidence bag, please?

02:54.565 --> 02:56.531
That could have been
a bear after all.

02:57.768 --> 02:59.701
- Could be.
- Maybe he

02:59.770 --> 03:02.037
accidentally snuck up
on a mother and her cubs?

03:02.106 --> 03:03.372
Only one way to find out.

03:03.440 --> 03:06.174
Spread out,
start looking.

03:06.243 --> 03:08.877
Paw prints, bear scat,
blood trail. Go.

03:08.946 --> 03:10.279
And by "scat" you mean...?

03:10.347 --> 03:11.713
Does a bear scat in the woods?

03:11.782 --> 03:14.216
Ah. Yeah, that's
what I thought you meant.

03:17.054 --> 03:19.354
He was just a baby-faced kid.

03:21.025 --> 03:23.392
Ah. Guess I can add this
to the list.

03:23.460 --> 03:25.027
Yeah? What list?

03:25.095 --> 03:27.796
Of the most horrible deaths
since I started here.

03:27.898 --> 03:28.964
This ranks somewhere

03:29.033 --> 03:30.832
between pummeled
with a war stick

03:30.901 --> 03:33.669
and boiled in a hot tub.
You know,

03:33.737 --> 03:36.838
technically, our hot tub guy was
stabbed before he was boiled.

03:36.907 --> 03:39.808
Yeah, that makes it
so much less horrible.

03:39.877 --> 03:42.811
Anyway, please tell me
this is your first bear attack.

03:42.880 --> 03:45.847
It is. If that's
what this is.

03:45.916 --> 03:47.816
You have this claw
and those wounds.

03:47.885 --> 03:48.817
What more do you need?

03:48.886 --> 03:51.219
I need whatever
you can find here.

03:51.288 --> 03:52.421
You got it.

03:52.489 --> 03:53.889
Quick as I can.

03:57.161 --> 03:59.094
- Hi.
- Hey.

03:59.163 --> 04:01.330
There's my favorite
son-in-law.

04:01.398 --> 04:02.398
What?

04:02.466 --> 04:03.565
Oh.

04:03.634 --> 04:05.334
Ed. Hey.

04:05.402 --> 04:07.402
You're busy.

04:07.471 --> 04:09.371
No. I, uh...
I-I mean, yes, yes.

04:09.440 --> 04:10.772
But I...

04:10.841 --> 04:12.074
Is everything okay?

04:12.142 --> 04:13.208
Everyone's super-duper.

04:13.277 --> 04:14.576
I was just in the neighborhood,

04:14.645 --> 04:15.744
thought I'd surprise you.

04:15.813 --> 04:17.045
Thank you, Agent Supliski.

04:17.113 --> 04:18.579
I've got him.

04:18.649 --> 04:20.548
And actually...

04:21.652 --> 04:23.852
...I thought
I'd grab you for lunch.

04:23.921 --> 04:26.221
Oh, gosh.
I-I would love that.

04:28.325 --> 04:29.632
Are you sure
there's nothing wrong?

04:29.633 --> 04:31.716
Given your reaction,
it must be obvious

04:31.717 --> 04:33.383
that we don't do this
nearly enough.

04:33.452 --> 04:34.651
Or ever.

04:36.455 --> 04:37.888
Uh, actually, you know what, Ed,

04:37.957 --> 04:40.724
I-I might have to take
a rain check for today.

04:40.793 --> 04:43.193
I've just started
a rather peculiar case.

04:44.263 --> 04:45.696
Forget peculiar.

04:45.764 --> 04:48.165
We don't get many like
this at the funeral home.

04:48.233 --> 04:50.467
I'd be worried if you did.

04:50.536 --> 04:52.669
Wow. Mind if I ask
what happened?

04:52.738 --> 04:53.870
Bear attack is

04:53.939 --> 04:55.639
the working theory so far.

04:55.708 --> 04:57.841
A bear? How crazy is that?

04:57.910 --> 04:59.876
Maybe a little <i>too</i> crazy, Ed.

04:59.912 --> 05:01.878
There's a lot
of claw marks here,

05:01.947 --> 05:04.247
but as you can see,
none of them are too deep.

05:04.316 --> 05:07.084
Yeah, I-I think a bear
would pack more of a wallop.

05:07.152 --> 05:08.986
Well, they look
plenty deep to me.

05:09.054 --> 05:10.988
I could see a grizzly bear
out west,

05:11.056 --> 05:12.990
or maybe a polar bear
up north, but...

05:13.058 --> 05:14.725
I mean, a black bear attack?

05:14.793 --> 05:17.094
Why not? I hear
about attacks all the time,

05:17.162 --> 05:19.162
and, you know,
black bears, brown bears,

05:19.231 --> 05:22.165
they all have teeth and claws,
right?

05:22.234 --> 05:23.234
Wait a minute.

05:23.268 --> 05:25.102
How did I miss that?

05:25.170 --> 05:26.737
Miss what?
What is it?

05:26.805 --> 05:29.072
It looks like a knife wound

05:29.141 --> 05:30.674
under this claw mark.

05:30.743 --> 05:34.111
Yeah. Yeah,
that's about an inch wide.

05:34.179 --> 05:36.246
Partially obscured
by this...

05:36.315 --> 05:37.414
torn dermis here.

05:37.483 --> 05:38.782
You see that, Ed?

05:38.851 --> 05:40.851
You...

05:40.919 --> 05:42.619
Ed? What's wrong?

05:42.688 --> 05:44.054
This was a bear.

05:44.123 --> 05:45.922
What?

05:45.991 --> 05:47.924
Say it was a bear. Please.

05:47.993 --> 05:50.127
Ed, wh-what are you...
I promise you, Jimmy,

05:50.195 --> 05:51.928
it's a matter
of life and death.

05:51.997 --> 05:53.930
Call it a bear attack.
For me.

05:53.999 --> 05:55.232
What do you got, Palmer?

05:55.300 --> 05:58.135
Oh. Agent Gibbs.

05:58.203 --> 05:59.936
Well, you know what?

06:00.005 --> 06:01.538
It's Ed Slater.

06:01.607 --> 06:04.641
I'm Jimmy's father-in-law
and Breena's dad.

06:04.710 --> 06:07.110
It's been a few years.
I'm glad you're well.

06:07.179 --> 06:09.446
Undertaker.
You remember. See?

06:09.515 --> 06:10.947
Yeah, that's right.

06:11.016 --> 06:14.117
Although I prefer
"postmortem coordinator."

06:14.186 --> 06:15.385
Palmer.

06:15.454 --> 06:17.154
You need an update?

06:17.222 --> 06:19.222
Still a bear?

06:20.325 --> 06:22.259
Um... yeah.

06:22.327 --> 06:24.494
I-It's...
it's still a bear.

06:25.931 --> 06:27.631
Keep me posted.

06:29.334 --> 06:31.268
Good to see you
again, Gibbs.

06:34.573 --> 06:36.139
What have I done?

06:47.591 --> 06:49.524
Can't believe
I just lied to Gibbs.

06:49.593 --> 06:50.893
And for what?

06:50.961 --> 06:52.294
Pancakes.

06:53.898 --> 06:55.831
You ever have pancakes
for lunch?

06:55.900 --> 06:57.399
What do you say?

06:59.603 --> 07:01.203
Tell me why, Ed,

07:01.272 --> 07:04.339
why, after years of
earning that man's trust,

07:04.408 --> 07:07.809
did I just lie to his
face because of you.

07:07.878 --> 07:09.411
What is so life-and-death?

07:09.480 --> 07:12.381
I hate to admit,
but I've been gambling.

07:12.449 --> 07:15.717
And, well, I thought it was just
a weekly friendly poker game

07:15.786 --> 07:18.053
with the other local merchants.

07:18.122 --> 07:20.055
Gambling is not
life-and-death, Ed.

07:20.124 --> 07:21.690
But $50K is.

07:22.793 --> 07:24.493
That's what I get
for going all in

07:24.561 --> 07:28.230
on four kings, not knowing
the dry cleaner had four aces.

07:28.299 --> 07:30.065
You lost $50,000

07:30.134 --> 07:31.900
to a dry cleaner?

07:31.969 --> 07:33.402
Peter hosts the game.

07:33.470 --> 07:35.170
Nice guy, or at least he was

07:35.239 --> 07:37.606
until I went to work out
a payment plan.

07:37.675 --> 07:39.574
Suddenly he had
a favor to ask

07:39.643 --> 07:41.952
that would erase
all my debts entirely.

07:41.953 --> 07:44.486
- A favor?
- He brought the kid's dead body

07:44.555 --> 07:46.021
to my embalming studio

07:46.090 --> 07:48.691
and told me to make it look
like an accident.

07:48.759 --> 07:50.392
Okay, who wants coffee?

07:50.461 --> 07:51.660
Not just yet.

07:51.729 --> 07:52.828
Actually...

07:52.897 --> 07:54.430
I'd love a cup.

07:54.498 --> 07:55.564
- Ed.
- Huh?

07:55.633 --> 07:57.433
Not just yet.

07:57.501 --> 07:58.934
Okay.

08:00.605 --> 08:02.838
Did the dry cleaner
tell you what happened?

08:02.907 --> 08:04.573
No, and I didn't ask.

08:04.642 --> 08:06.609
I saw the knife wound
and that he was Navy,

08:06.677 --> 08:08.711
so I figured
eventually he'd end up

08:08.746 --> 08:11.080
on your autopsy table, so...

08:11.148 --> 08:14.016
So you thought you'd
just fake a bear attack.

08:14.085 --> 08:17.753
That's why I worked so hard
to make it look real

08:17.822 --> 08:19.622
so that'd make your job easier.

08:19.690 --> 08:22.024
Wh-What,
to help you cover up a murder?

08:22.093 --> 08:24.126
That's not exactly what we did.

08:24.195 --> 08:25.561
That is exactly what...

08:25.630 --> 08:26.795
That is exactly

08:26.864 --> 08:28.764
what <i>you</i> did, not <i>we.</i>

08:28.833 --> 08:31.200
Unless...
What about Stevie?

08:31.268 --> 08:33.402
Is he still helping you out
at the funeral home?

08:33.471 --> 08:34.681
Sure, yeah,
but Stevie's out of town.

08:34.705 --> 08:36.015
He doesn't know
anything about it.

08:36.039 --> 08:37.940
Of course. Your
own son stays clean

08:38.009 --> 08:40.075
while your son-in-law gets
dragged through the mud.

08:40.144 --> 08:42.077
I swear I'll make it up to you.

08:42.145 --> 08:43.912
Don't. Just...

08:43.981 --> 08:45.214
I don't...

08:45.282 --> 08:48.083
Tell me who else
plays in this game.

08:48.152 --> 08:49.451
It's me and Peter Liu--

08:49.520 --> 08:51.487
<i>he's the dry cleaner--</i>

08:51.555 --> 08:53.789
<i>Janice, the Froyo lady,</i>

08:53.858 --> 08:56.058
<i>Dimitri, who owns a barbershop,</i>

08:56.127 --> 08:57.826
<i>old man DiNozzo,</i>

08:57.895 --> 08:59.428
<i>Lenny the bartender,</i>

08:59.497 --> 09:00.729
<i>and...</i>
<i>Stop.</i>

09:02.033 --> 09:04.767
Did you just say
"old man DiNozzo"?

09:04.835 --> 09:06.769
Anthony. Yeah.
He's retired,

09:06.837 --> 09:09.238
but a real old-school raconteur.

09:09.306 --> 09:11.607
- He knows terrific stories.
- Okay,

09:11.676 --> 09:13.642
w-was he there
the night that you lost?

09:13.711 --> 09:15.477
Yeah. Why? Do you know him?

09:15.546 --> 09:17.212
You bet I do.
I'm gonna reach out

09:17.281 --> 09:18.480
and see if he can help.

09:18.549 --> 09:19.748
Uh...

09:19.817 --> 09:21.850
what do you want me to do?

09:21.919 --> 09:25.154
Uh, you just... order
your coffee and pancakes

09:25.222 --> 09:26.855
and... I don't know,

09:26.924 --> 09:29.958
try not to cover up any more
murders till I get back, huh?

09:31.962 --> 09:35.097
Sarcasm doesn't help.

09:35.166 --> 09:37.700
"Derived from the Greek word
<i>'skat'</i> with a 'K,'

09:37.768 --> 09:39.968
meaning 'excrement
of an animal'."

09:40.037 --> 09:41.870
Yeah. Wild animals, maybe.

09:41.939 --> 09:45.774
Cows have manure,
cow pats, meadow muffins...

09:45.843 --> 09:48.043
Bird droppings,
bat guano...

09:48.112 --> 09:49.511
Wait, did you say
"meadow muffins"?

09:49.580 --> 09:51.380
Cut the crap.
You find any?

09:51.449 --> 09:53.282
No, boss,
no, uh, scat at the scene.

09:53.350 --> 09:54.650
No paw prints, either.

09:54.719 --> 09:55.851
Then what do we have?

09:55.920 --> 09:58.520
Petty Officer
Third Class Logan Braddish, 22.

09:58.589 --> 10:01.123
Served three years,
stationed out of Norfolk,

10:01.192 --> 10:03.158
where he never reported back
this past Sunday

10:03.227 --> 10:04.660
after weekend liberty.

10:04.729 --> 10:06.695
Navy pals claimed that
he left their group

10:06.764 --> 10:09.076
Friday night to check out this
trendy nightclub in Georgetown,

10:09.100 --> 10:11.300
and that was the last
they saw of him.

10:11.368 --> 10:14.136
- Any family in the area?
- No. He was from Vermont.

10:14.205 --> 10:16.283
His family has been notified.
His dad is on his way down.

10:16.307 --> 10:18.540
McGee, Bishop, check out
the nightclub. Torres,

10:18.609 --> 10:21.510
call the rangers again, find out
if they have any bear sightings.

10:21.579 --> 10:23.345
Scat.

10:23.414 --> 10:25.748
Call me back as soon
as you can, Mr. DiNozzo.

10:25.816 --> 10:26.982
It's urgent.

10:27.051 --> 10:29.184
Thank you.

10:29.253 --> 10:31.587
Hey there.

10:31.655 --> 10:33.188
You finished already?

10:33.257 --> 10:35.190
Yes. And...
look who's back.

10:36.627 --> 10:37.993
I... Oh, of course.

10:38.062 --> 10:39.661
Dr. Mallard!

10:39.730 --> 10:41.897
Good to see you,
too, Dr. Palmer.

10:41.966 --> 10:43.866
You aren't due back
for several weeks.

10:43.934 --> 10:45.768
Yes. But this weekend,

10:45.836 --> 10:48.704
I have a table at the...

10:48.773 --> 10:51.106
Marine Corps Scholarship
Foundation Ball.

10:51.175 --> 10:52.407
So...

10:52.476 --> 10:54.176
back I am.

10:54.245 --> 10:55.778
And we're so glad you are.

10:55.846 --> 10:58.947
Yes. Definitely glad.

10:59.016 --> 11:02.084
And I discovered he was back
because I have some weird news.

11:02.153 --> 11:04.086
- Weird?
- Those samples you gave me?

11:04.155 --> 11:07.422
They contain not one trace
of bear saliva.

11:07.491 --> 11:09.892
Bear saliva.

11:09.960 --> 11:12.728
This must be the petty
officer in question.

11:12.797 --> 11:14.296
That-that is weird, Kasie.

11:14.365 --> 11:16.276
L-Let me take another sample
here just to make sure.

11:16.300 --> 11:17.599
May I assist you with that?

11:17.668 --> 11:19.902
No, you may not.

11:19.970 --> 11:22.404
What I mean to say is that
if I have made a mistake,

11:22.473 --> 11:24.773
I would prefer to
correct it myself,

11:24.842 --> 11:26.575
if you don't mind.
- Hmm.

11:26.644 --> 11:28.544
Of course.

11:29.647 --> 11:32.414
You know, Duckster, I'd, um...

11:32.483 --> 11:35.818
I would love to show you
the latest addition to my lab.

11:35.886 --> 11:37.619
Yes! Yes, comfy chairs.

11:37.688 --> 11:39.454
You need to try these out.

11:39.523 --> 11:41.924
I'm, well, I-I'm
gonna just, um, swab,

11:41.992 --> 11:44.793
uh, another sample for
Kasie and that's all.

11:46.530 --> 11:50.232
Very well. Lead the way, Kasie.

11:55.139 --> 11:56.672
So glad you're back.

11:58.209 --> 12:00.709
Oh, man.

12:00.778 --> 12:03.245
What am I doing?

12:03.314 --> 12:05.948
Can I be doing this?

12:06.016 --> 12:08.083
Is this even happening?

12:08.152 --> 12:09.651
Why am I asking you?

12:14.992 --> 12:18.327
Mr. DiNozzo.
Thank you for calling me back.

12:20.431 --> 12:22.631
What's up, Brother Jimmy?

12:22.700 --> 12:23.866
What's the deal?

12:23.934 --> 12:27.669
Deal? What deal?
There's no deal.

12:27.738 --> 12:29.838
Kasie texted me.
She said you were stressed.

12:29.907 --> 12:31.306
What's wrong, man?

12:31.375 --> 12:32.841
I just got a lot going on.
You know?

12:32.910 --> 12:35.177
And I was just going
to meet someone, so, uh...

12:35.246 --> 12:36.979
Who are you gonna meet?

12:37.047 --> 12:38.981
Spit it out, dude.

12:39.049 --> 12:41.383
Talk to your boy Nick.

12:42.519 --> 12:43.886
Fine.

12:43.954 --> 12:45.487
You don't happen
to know somewhere

12:45.556 --> 12:47.236
where I could get
some bear saliva, do you?

12:55.199 --> 12:57.699
I actually do know a guy.

12:57.768 --> 12:59.668
But the guy is super weird,

12:59.737 --> 13:01.403
so this has to be
really important.

13:01.472 --> 13:03.038
Yeah, I lied to Gibbs.

13:03.107 --> 13:04.706
- What?
- I did it. I lied.

13:04.775 --> 13:06.586
It happened so fast.
Please, just don't tell him.

13:06.610 --> 13:08.143
No, I won't.
But you know he knows.

13:08.212 --> 13:09.956
He does know, doesn't he?
Yeah, he always knows.

13:09.980 --> 13:11.691
Yeah, I knew the second
that I told him that he knew.

13:11.715 --> 13:14.349
Worse off, he knows
that I know that he knows.

13:14.418 --> 13:16.251
Well, you know how he knows.
He knows that...

13:16.320 --> 13:18.020
Never mind.

13:18.088 --> 13:20.756
Why did you lie?
Okay, so, it's a long story,

13:20.824 --> 13:22.057
but...
Actually, don't tell me.

13:22.126 --> 13:23.803
I don't want to know.
I'm better off that way.

13:23.827 --> 13:25.360
You got to fix this, right?

13:25.429 --> 13:28.163
Yeah. I fully intend to.

13:30.167 --> 13:32.200
I gotta clean up
something else first.

13:32.269 --> 13:34.736
What's that something else
you have to clean up?

13:34.805 --> 13:36.438
Do you really want to know,
Nick?

13:36.507 --> 13:38.073
Yes. No.

13:38.142 --> 13:40.342
No. Yes. Actually, no, I
don't really want to know.

13:40.411 --> 13:41.877
No, don't tell me.

13:41.946 --> 13:43.412
I don't really want to know.

13:43.480 --> 13:46.048
I really want to know.

13:47.117 --> 13:48.550
That's quite a tale.

13:48.619 --> 13:50.018
Yeah? What do you think?

13:50.087 --> 13:52.054
How well do you know
this, uh, dry cleaner?

13:52.122 --> 13:53.956
- Peter? Well enough.
- Hmm.

13:54.024 --> 13:56.058
Being an excellent poker player

13:56.126 --> 13:58.193
doesn't necessarily make him
a killer.

13:58.262 --> 14:00.028
He's not excellent, just lucky.

14:00.097 --> 14:02.230
I'm afraid it's more
than I can say for you.

14:02.299 --> 14:04.366
Watching you play
that last hand

14:04.435 --> 14:05.867
that night, Ed,
was like watching

14:05.936 --> 14:07.769
a car wreck in slow motion.

14:07.838 --> 14:09.771
His raises
were way over the top,

14:09.840 --> 14:12.407
and he's got so many tells.

14:12.476 --> 14:14.910
No, I don't.
Yes, you do.

14:14.979 --> 14:17.424
I knew something was wrong the
second you came in this morning.

14:17.448 --> 14:18.814
Your lower lip twitches.

14:18.882 --> 14:20.315
And the eyebrows, huh?

14:20.384 --> 14:22.150
The best of Groucho.

14:22.219 --> 14:24.152
Plus, uh, he's a table talker.

14:24.221 --> 14:26.621
Constantly bragging
between hands

14:26.690 --> 14:30.325
about his hotshot son-in-law
who runs NCIS.

14:30.394 --> 14:33.261
You tell people I run NCIS?

14:33.330 --> 14:34.830
Well, it's easier
than explaining

14:34.898 --> 14:36.798
what an assistant ME does.

14:36.867 --> 14:39.301
I've told you seven times,
I'm not an assistant anymore.

14:39.370 --> 14:40.947
And-and you didn't
bother correcting him?

14:40.971 --> 14:42.404
I'm not a table talker.

14:42.473 --> 14:45.073
But could we get back
to the alleged murder?

14:45.142 --> 14:46.441
You're right. I'm afraid

14:46.510 --> 14:48.844
it's more than alleged,
though, Mr. D.

14:48.912 --> 14:51.780
The poor kid
was clearly stabbed.

14:51.849 --> 14:53.115
But by whom?

14:53.183 --> 14:55.851
I mean, Peter hardly seems
like the type.

14:55.919 --> 14:57.786
I could talk to him.

14:57.855 --> 15:00.422
Yeah? And say what?

15:00.491 --> 15:01.590
Well, I'd mediate.

15:01.658 --> 15:03.859
Uh, try to get Ed
off the hook here

15:03.927 --> 15:05.494
and maybe point us

15:05.562 --> 15:07.262
in the, uh, direction
of the true killer.

15:07.331 --> 15:08.764
That would be fantastic.

15:08.832 --> 15:10.265
Yeah, I'll take Ed with me,

15:10.334 --> 15:13.101
but I think it's, uh, better
if you steer clear.

15:13.170 --> 15:14.336
No, absolutely not.

15:14.405 --> 15:16.004
No, this is on me to clean up.

15:16.073 --> 15:17.773
If you go, I go.

15:17.841 --> 15:19.775
I wouldn't mind not going.

15:19.843 --> 15:22.511
Oh, no, you're going.
We're all going.

15:24.281 --> 15:25.814
<i>Oh, it's a Liu's Hangers.</i>

15:25.883 --> 15:27.394
<i>There's one of these</i>
<i>in my neighborhood.</i>

15:27.418 --> 15:29.951
- Must be a chain, huh?
- Peter Liu's.

15:30.020 --> 15:31.319
The best in the biz.

15:31.388 --> 15:33.688
Yeah, it's no wonder
he can afford to host

15:33.757 --> 15:35.123
such a high-stakes game.

15:35.192 --> 15:37.292
Oh, there are far bigger games
than this.

15:37.361 --> 15:38.960
And with some serious
high rollers.

15:39.029 --> 15:40.629
Too high for my blood.

15:40.697 --> 15:42.631
Hey, guys, before we go in,

15:42.699 --> 15:45.901
I beg you to just stay civil
with Peter.

15:45.969 --> 15:48.837
Relax, Ed. The guy's a pussycat.

15:48.906 --> 15:50.238
Hold on.

15:50.307 --> 15:51.706
Your lower lip is twitching.

15:51.775 --> 15:53.375
No, it's not.

15:53.444 --> 15:55.710
There go the dancing eyebrows.

15:55.779 --> 15:57.979
All right, Groucho.
Spill your guts.

15:58.048 --> 15:59.626
- What are you not telling us?
- All right.

15:59.650 --> 16:01.716
Fine. You know what,
maybe it's better that you know

16:01.785 --> 16:03.085
before we go in.
- Know what?

16:03.153 --> 16:05.887
Peter Liu's got Stevie.

16:05.956 --> 16:07.689
- Stevie?
- Ed's son.

16:07.758 --> 16:09.524
Wait, wh-what do
you mean, "got"?

16:09.593 --> 16:12.727
Peter's taken him as insurance.

16:12.796 --> 16:13.540
Insurance.

16:13.564 --> 16:15.213
You know, he's not
giving Stevie back

16:15.214 --> 16:17.156
until I take care
of the dead kid.

16:17.157 --> 16:18.824
Oh, you have got
to be kidding me.

16:18.892 --> 16:20.325
I wish I was, but...

16:20.394 --> 16:22.928
Okay, so-so, Stevie
has been taken hostage,

16:22.996 --> 16:24.879
and you're only telling us
about this now?

16:24.903 --> 16:25.431
Hey.

16:25.432 --> 16:28.166
The last thing Peter said
was if I tell anyone,

16:28.235 --> 16:29.568
Stevie's good as dead.

16:29.636 --> 16:31.047
Okay. All right.
You know what, guys?

16:31.071 --> 16:34.272
We should just go. All right?

16:34.341 --> 16:36.074
It might be a little late
for that.

16:39.813 --> 16:41.513
I hope he can't read lips.

16:50.533 --> 16:52.633
Bear attack. Ridiculous.

16:52.702 --> 16:54.802
I told you to stick
with the plan

16:54.871 --> 16:56.503
and just cremate the guy.

16:56.572 --> 16:59.473
I couldn't do it, Peter.

17:00.543 --> 17:02.543
Cremate him, Ed?

17:02.612 --> 17:05.479
I thought he told you to make it
look like an accident.

17:05.548 --> 17:08.749
He was also warned
not to tell anyone,

17:08.818 --> 17:10.684
but here you are.

17:10.752 --> 17:14.922
The famous son-in-law
who runs NCIS.

17:14.991 --> 17:18.358
I may not run NCIS,
but make no mistake.

17:18.426 --> 17:22.496
I could have a team of agents
down here in minutes.

17:22.565 --> 17:26.066
You're in too deep
with too much to lose.

17:26.135 --> 17:28.202
If you weren't,
your agents

17:28.271 --> 17:29.737
would be here already.

17:29.805 --> 17:33.374
Peter, can we
just take a breath?

17:33.442 --> 17:35.376
It's me talking,

17:35.444 --> 17:37.912
your old buddy Tony.

17:37.980 --> 17:41.849
I'm sure that you and I
can reach a compromise.

17:41.918 --> 17:44.084
You know what, Tony?
You are a buddy,

17:44.153 --> 17:47.221
so I'll tell you this once.

17:47.290 --> 17:51.358
Keep your nose out of this
or lose it.

17:51.427 --> 17:53.027
How's that for compromise?

17:53.095 --> 17:55.396
Not exactly what I had in mind.

17:55.464 --> 17:57.731
Would you just tell us
if Stevie is here?

17:57.800 --> 17:59.767
He's safe.

17:59.835 --> 18:01.969
But he'll only
stay that way

18:02.038 --> 18:04.738
if you can sell
this stupid bear attack.

18:04.807 --> 18:08.475
Mind you, a simple cremation
would've avoided all of this.

18:08.544 --> 18:10.611
Thank your father-in-law
for that.

18:10.680 --> 18:12.312
The bear attack wasn't
stupid, by the way.

18:12.313 --> 18:12.905
It was stupid.

18:12.906 --> 18:14.773
Now go finish this.

18:15.876 --> 18:17.042
Go!

18:23.851 --> 18:25.829
If you'd just told me about
Stevie from the start, Ed,

18:25.853 --> 18:27.364
I would've handled this
a lot differently.

18:27.388 --> 18:29.021
I was afraid. I panicked.

18:29.089 --> 18:31.289
I panicked a little bit
myself in there.

18:31.358 --> 18:34.059
Okay. All right, we are
all done panicking.

18:34.128 --> 18:35.694
I know now what I have to do.

18:35.763 --> 18:37.129
You'll sign off
on the bear attack?

18:37.197 --> 18:40.132
No! Ed, there's no
more bear attack.

18:42.870 --> 18:45.370
What I have to do is much worse.

18:47.541 --> 18:50.142
Good morning, McGee. You, uh,
get the footage uploaded?

18:50.210 --> 18:51.376
Just finishing now.

18:51.445 --> 18:53.812
What up, what up?
You came through the back way?

18:53.881 --> 18:55.514
I went to see Jimmy,
but he's not in yet.

18:55.582 --> 18:56.715
Has he been through here?

18:56.784 --> 18:57.849
No. Why?

18:57.918 --> 18:59.484
No reason.

19:02.823 --> 19:04.656
Nick.

19:04.725 --> 19:06.158
Ellie.

19:06.226 --> 19:08.093
How'd it go at the club?

19:08.162 --> 19:10.695
No, you first.

19:10.764 --> 19:12.164
No.

19:12.232 --> 19:13.732
<i>You</i> first. Nightclub.

19:13.801 --> 19:15.534
- Go.
- Well, we confirmed

19:15.602 --> 19:17.502
Petty Officer Braddish was there

19:17.571 --> 19:18.571
Friday night.

19:18.639 --> 19:20.072
Club's owner recognized him

19:20.140 --> 19:22.007
as one of two men
tossed out for fighting.

19:22.076 --> 19:25.343
Owner didn't know either man,
but the bouncers said

19:25.412 --> 19:26.990
that both men were drunk and
hitting on the same girl.

19:27.014 --> 19:28.413
That's what led to the brawl.

19:28.482 --> 19:30.460
There were no cameras outside
the club, so we're looking

19:30.484 --> 19:32.451
for witnesses
who may have seen what happened

19:32.519 --> 19:33.685
after they were thrown out.

19:33.754 --> 19:34.931
Find the witnesses.

19:34.955 --> 19:36.354
Get the footage down to Kasie.

19:36.423 --> 19:37.923
- Facial recognition.
- Got it.

19:37.991 --> 19:40.892
Hey, uh, Gibbs,
the kid's father is here

19:40.961 --> 19:42.894
with Sloane in the
conference room.

19:45.466 --> 19:48.366
When did you last speak
to your son, Mr. Braddish?

19:48.435 --> 19:51.369
Uh, right before
weekend liberty.

19:51.438 --> 19:53.538
He'd been working hard.

19:53.607 --> 19:55.540
He was pumped.

19:55.609 --> 19:57.776
Last thing I said to him...

20:00.647 --> 20:04.549
The last thing I said to him
was, "Be careful."

20:04.618 --> 20:07.919
Why? Was Logan planning to do
anything daring or dangerous?

20:07.988 --> 20:10.689
No, no, just letting off
a little steam.

20:10.757 --> 20:13.625
Logan was a bit
of a hellcat as a teen,

20:13.694 --> 20:16.394
but the navy
really turned him around.

20:16.463 --> 20:17.963
Hey, there.

20:18.031 --> 20:19.931
Special Agent Gibbs.
Don't get up.

20:21.401 --> 20:23.135
We're sorry about your loss.

20:23.203 --> 20:25.137
Thank you.

20:26.306 --> 20:28.240
Not that, uh...

20:28.308 --> 20:29.841
not that Logan was a bad kid.

20:29.910 --> 20:31.176
He just...

20:31.245 --> 20:32.911
A little bit of a partier,
you know?

20:32.980 --> 20:35.480
Too much beer
after football games.

20:35.549 --> 20:36.948
He get in many fights?

20:37.017 --> 20:38.683
He had a few scrapes,
like anyone.

20:38.752 --> 20:40.485
Why?

20:40.554 --> 20:43.121
Are you trying to tell me
that that's how he died?

20:43.190 --> 20:45.257
Was Logan in a fight?

20:45.325 --> 20:46.458
We're still working on that.

20:46.527 --> 20:48.593
Please.

20:48.662 --> 20:51.596
The cops won't give me
any details.

20:51.665 --> 20:53.598
How did he die?

20:53.667 --> 20:55.133
I'm so sorry, Mr. Braddish.

20:55.202 --> 20:57.202
We know this is very difficult.

20:57.271 --> 20:59.871
Can I at least see him?

21:01.675 --> 21:03.041
I hate to interrupt.

21:04.411 --> 21:05.677
Can I have a minute?

21:12.753 --> 21:14.786
That was the father?
I just couldn't

21:14.855 --> 21:17.167
bring myself to tell him that
his son was mauled by a bear.

21:17.191 --> 21:20.859
Uh, it-it wasn't a bear attack.

21:20.928 --> 21:22.794
Then what was it?

21:22.863 --> 21:26.364
I can't say until I've talked
with Agent Gibbs.

21:26.433 --> 21:28.800
Privately.

21:28.869 --> 21:30.802
Okay.

21:34.441 --> 21:37.042
First of all, Gibbs, I...
No.

21:37.110 --> 21:39.644
Not here.

21:40.747 --> 21:42.214
Is this really necessary?

21:42.282 --> 21:44.216
Depends. What do you
have to tell me?

21:44.284 --> 21:45.684
Sit down.

21:45.752 --> 21:47.686
Is anyone back there?

21:47.754 --> 21:50.989
No. Not yet.

21:51.058 --> 21:52.591
So talk fast.

21:56.797 --> 22:00.098
I... lied to you, Agent Gibbs.

22:00.167 --> 22:02.667
And I know that you know that already,
but what you don't know

22:02.736 --> 22:05.070
is that Ed had just begged me
to cover for him

22:05.138 --> 22:07.205
after he lost $50,000
in a poker game

22:07.274 --> 22:10.242
to an evil dry cleaner who I'm
pretty sure killed our Navy kid

22:10.310 --> 22:12.344
and then demanded
that Ed cremate the body,

22:12.412 --> 22:14.346
or he'd never see
his son Stevie again.

22:14.414 --> 22:17.916
Only instead of doing that,
Ed, h-he fakes a bear attack

22:17.985 --> 22:19.718
and never even tells me
about Stevie

22:19.786 --> 22:22.454
until just before me,
Ed and Mr. DiNozzo

22:22.522 --> 22:23.688
go to see
the dry cleaner.

22:23.757 --> 22:25.190
Yeah, that's right:
Senior,

22:25.259 --> 22:27.125
he plays in this game as well,
so he thought

22:27.194 --> 22:28.771
maybe he could reason
with the dry cleaner,

22:28.795 --> 22:30.395
but you know what?
No dice.

22:30.430 --> 22:32.430
So the... the guy
still has Stevie,

22:32.499 --> 22:34.766
and I'm sorry.

22:34.835 --> 22:36.067
Go back.

22:36.136 --> 22:37.402
And I won't blame you

22:37.471 --> 22:39.104
for wanting to fire me
right now,

22:39.172 --> 22:40.705
but I-I guess
I could just...

22:40.774 --> 22:42.374
I could plead
temporary insanity.

22:42.442 --> 22:44.209
Under intense familial pressure,

22:44.278 --> 22:45.944
I stupidly thought
that I could...

22:46.013 --> 22:48.380
I could thread the needle
between my personal ethics,

22:48.448 --> 22:50.782
my loyalty and-and Breena.

22:50.851 --> 22:52.217
Oh, my wife.
Agent Gibbs,

22:52.286 --> 22:54.419
she worships her father,
and hearing any of this

22:54.488 --> 22:56.955
would just break her heart,
and so... so...

22:57.024 --> 22:59.491
so, uh...

22:59.559 --> 23:01.593
nothing.

23:01.662 --> 23:03.828
I'm done.

23:03.897 --> 23:05.997
No. No, you're not done.

23:06.066 --> 23:08.099
Who's the dry cleaner?

23:08.168 --> 23:11.336
Right. Uh, his name is,
uh, uh, Peter Liu.

23:11.405 --> 23:13.104
He owns Liu's Hangers chain,

23:13.173 --> 23:15.140
which, I'm sure,
is just a front.

23:15.208 --> 23:16.741
He's clearly Mr. Big.

23:16.810 --> 23:18.068
I can take you
to his main office.

23:18.092 --> 23:19.811
Stop.

23:25.385 --> 23:28.186
- This is for my confession?
- The address.

23:31.191 --> 23:33.491
You knew the whole time,
didn't you?

23:36.363 --> 23:38.997
It's a culture of lies, Palmer.

23:39.066 --> 23:41.666
Deceit, dishonesty,

23:41.735 --> 23:43.201
hypocrisy.

23:43.270 --> 23:46.037
Stupid is smart.

23:46.106 --> 23:48.006
Disgrace...

23:48.075 --> 23:49.808
is honor.

23:49.876 --> 23:51.443
Not to me, Agent Gibbs. I...

23:51.511 --> 23:53.011
It's our
responsibility

23:53.080 --> 23:54.713
to fix things.

23:56.550 --> 23:58.483
I have to trust you.

23:58.552 --> 24:00.118
You can.

24:01.888 --> 24:04.489
Gibbs, I am so sorry.

24:04.558 --> 24:07.125
Don't lie.

24:08.228 --> 24:10.028
Finish that
autopsy.

24:10.097 --> 24:12.831
You make that kid
look presentable for his dad.

24:17.738 --> 24:19.037
NCIS!

24:34.888 --> 24:36.154
Clear.

24:36.223 --> 24:37.355
Clear.

24:38.658 --> 24:40.425
Not clear.

24:48.902 --> 24:51.569
Think this is Jimmy's Mr. Big?

24:53.006 --> 24:54.606
Not anymore.

25:04.537 --> 25:06.437
Look, Gibbs, don't be
too hard on Jimmy.

25:06.506 --> 25:09.340
It was me.
I'm the one.

25:09.409 --> 25:11.376
With Peter dead,
where's that leave Stevie?

25:11.444 --> 25:13.278
Maybe it's Stevie
who killed him.

25:13.346 --> 25:15.313
No. There's no way.
It was not Stevie.

25:15.382 --> 25:16.681
Then who?
You and Palmer

25:16.750 --> 25:18.883
were the last to see
the dry cleaner alive.

25:18.952 --> 25:20.685
Yeah, but you know
we didn't do it.

25:21.855 --> 25:22.855
Don't you?

25:24.758 --> 25:26.958
How did Stevie
get mixed up in this?

25:27.027 --> 25:28.326
He's not.

25:28.395 --> 25:29.560
He's-he's a great kid

25:29.629 --> 25:31.996
and, uh, just a casualty
of my stupidity.

25:34.134 --> 25:36.200
Well, someone disagrees.

25:36.269 --> 25:37.735
He had some issues
as a youngster,

25:37.804 --> 25:40.204
but he's way past that now
for weeks.

25:40.273 --> 25:41.539
Years.

25:41.608 --> 25:43.574
Tell the
truth, Ed.

25:43.643 --> 25:44.709
Palmer!

25:44.778 --> 25:46.210
Get in here!

25:46.279 --> 25:47.279
Give him hell, Jimmy.

25:47.314 --> 25:49.480
Good luck.

25:49.549 --> 25:51.316
You're gonna need it.

25:57.557 --> 25:59.157
All right...

25:59.225 --> 26:00.725
that...

26:04.597 --> 26:06.230
All right,

26:06.299 --> 26:08.166
no more family card
to play here, Ed.

26:08.234 --> 26:09.334
Time to come clean.

26:09.402 --> 26:10.668
Stevie didn't do anything.

26:10.737 --> 26:12.337
Are you sure about that?

26:12.405 --> 26:14.939
Ed, you have been making excuses
for him his entire life,

26:15.008 --> 26:17.075
after how many DUIs?
Hey!

26:17.143 --> 26:18.509
The cheating at school.

26:18.578 --> 26:20.578
Bouncing from one
job to the next.

26:20.647 --> 26:22.714
All that's ancient history.

26:22.782 --> 26:26.184
Or roping us all in to some
can't-miss real estate scam? Ed.

26:26.252 --> 26:28.086
Hey! What the hell
does any of this

26:28.154 --> 26:29.954
have to do with
our dead sailor?

26:30.023 --> 26:31.222
Nothing. I just...

26:31.291 --> 26:33.624
Trying to set the
record straight.

26:33.693 --> 26:35.126
I...

26:35.195 --> 26:37.261
Sorry.

26:37.330 --> 26:39.731
No. I'm sorry.

26:41.334 --> 26:43.901
Still making excuses,
covering up for him.

26:43.970 --> 26:44.805
Covering for what?

26:44.829 --> 26:46.672
Wasn't my gambling
that started all this.

26:46.673 --> 26:47.905
It was Stevie's.

26:47.974 --> 26:50.975
He got himself
into a much bigger game.

26:51.044 --> 26:52.044
How much he lose?

26:52.112 --> 26:53.544
Over $200,000.

26:53.613 --> 26:55.413
Which is why I was betting
so high at Peter's.

26:55.448 --> 26:57.982
Just trying to get us out of debt,
but my luck was no better.

26:58.051 --> 26:59.984
And then, uh, last
Friday I got a call

27:00.053 --> 27:02.220
about a meeting in
Georgetown around 2:00 a.m.

27:02.288 --> 27:04.322
Peter had the Navy kid's body
in the trunk

27:04.391 --> 27:06.491
of this other fella's fancy car.

27:06.559 --> 27:07.925
What other fella?

27:07.994 --> 27:08.994
Peter called him Kenny.

27:09.062 --> 27:10.995
Asian. Around 30.

27:11.031 --> 27:12.930
He's the one
who ran the big game.

27:12.999 --> 27:14.499
Kenny it is.

27:14.567 --> 27:16.901
Kenny told us
he'd get us out of debt

27:16.970 --> 27:18.569
right after we got
rid of the body.

27:18.638 --> 27:20.338
- But you didn't.
- I couldn't.

27:20.407 --> 27:23.107
His family
deserves closure.

27:24.210 --> 27:26.411
This him?

27:26.479 --> 27:28.279
Yeah, that's him.

27:28.348 --> 27:32.150
All right, you're
still in custody.

27:32.218 --> 27:34.786
If he tries to
leave, shoot him.

27:40.727 --> 27:44.095
Just wish you hadn't aired
all that personal family dirt

27:44.164 --> 27:45.496
in front of Gibbs.

27:45.565 --> 27:47.331
It's nobody's business.

27:47.400 --> 27:50.001
- Seriously?
- Hey,

27:50.070 --> 27:52.336
Stevie has had challenges
you know nothing about.

27:52.405 --> 27:54.872
Not everyone is born
with your sunny disposition

27:54.941 --> 27:56.441
unencumbered
by darkness.

27:56.509 --> 27:58.976
Unencumbered?
Is that what you think of me?

27:59.045 --> 28:02.013
You think I just, I came into this world
just whistling rainbows?

28:02.082 --> 28:04.315
You know, at first
glance, uh, yeah.

28:04.384 --> 28:06.617
What do you know
about me?

28:06.686 --> 28:09.287
About my family,
about my upbringing.

28:09.355 --> 28:10.822
About my dad.

28:10.890 --> 28:13.057
Ed, have you ever even asked?

28:13.126 --> 28:14.358
I always assumed...

28:14.427 --> 28:15.993
He died when I was ten.

28:17.297 --> 28:18.963
You know, the sad part is...

28:19.032 --> 28:20.798
we were okay.

28:20.867 --> 28:22.800
My dad, he was...

28:25.905 --> 28:28.239
...he was not a good man.

28:28.308 --> 28:30.308
I'll leave it at that.

28:30.376 --> 28:32.877
I only gave up hating him
after Victoria was born...

28:32.946 --> 28:36.247
as a daily conscious
and concerted effort

28:36.316 --> 28:38.182
to never be like him.

28:38.251 --> 28:40.084
I have one--

28:40.153 --> 28:42.320
make that two

28:42.388 --> 28:45.156
great father figures
here at NCIS.

28:45.225 --> 28:47.091
And yet there is
something in me

28:47.160 --> 28:50.061
that is still
holding out hope for you,

28:50.130 --> 28:53.664
that one day you're actually
gonna show up for me...

28:53.733 --> 28:55.666
like an actual dad.

28:57.570 --> 28:59.704
Why would I do that?

29:01.908 --> 29:03.908
What is wrong with me?

29:03.977 --> 29:06.277
- Oh, Jimmy, I...
- No.

29:06.346 --> 29:08.613
I've got work to do.
Come on.

29:09.749 --> 29:12.583
Update. Find any Kennys?

29:12.652 --> 29:14.852
No, sir. Not yet.

29:14.921 --> 29:16.854
I've been
looking into Peter Liu.

29:16.923 --> 29:19.357
No prior criminal record,
but his personal history

29:19.425 --> 29:21.392
might help us.
Put it up.

29:21.461 --> 29:24.195
Emigrated from Singapore
in 1997.

29:24.264 --> 29:25.863
He worked menial jobs for years

29:25.932 --> 29:28.099
before opening up his
first three dry-cleaning shops

29:28.168 --> 29:29.433
in 2008.

29:29.502 --> 29:30.980
How'd he swing that?
Well, with the help

29:31.004 --> 29:32.370
of Liu's childhood friend,

29:32.438 --> 29:33.871
the shops were bankrolled

29:33.940 --> 29:35.873
by someone named Henry Deng.

29:35.942 --> 29:37.542
Wait, <i>the</i> Henry Deng?

29:37.610 --> 29:38.610
You know him?

29:38.645 --> 29:39.810
Well, the man's a god

29:39.879 --> 29:40.945
in the tech world.

29:41.014 --> 29:43.114
Harvard MBA
who now owns

29:43.183 --> 29:45.427
multiple corporations globally.
He's one of the wealthiest guys

29:45.451 --> 29:46.584
in Singapore.

29:46.653 --> 29:48.452
Keep digging.

29:50.323 --> 29:51.656
Ducky.

29:51.724 --> 29:53.057
Anthony!

29:53.126 --> 29:54.559
What a pleasant surprise.

29:54.627 --> 29:55.993
The surprise is mine.

29:56.062 --> 29:58.963
No one mentioned
that you were back.

29:59.032 --> 30:01.165
Yeah, funny the way that is.

30:01.234 --> 30:04.168
I heard my, uh, poker pal

30:04.237 --> 30:06.270
was on your table here.

30:06.339 --> 30:08.339
That's the last time that
I will ever get involved

30:08.374 --> 30:10.041
in business with NCIS.

30:10.076 --> 30:12.677
Well, that may make
the two of us.

30:12.745 --> 30:14.845
What does that mean?

30:14.914 --> 30:17.481
It means that this
may be my last autopsy

30:17.550 --> 30:19.951
for a while, perhaps ever.

30:20.019 --> 30:21.485
What are you talking about?

30:21.554 --> 30:23.988
How do you do it, Anthony?

30:24.057 --> 30:26.023
What's your secret?

30:26.092 --> 30:31.362
How do you reinvent yourself
so successfully time and again,

30:31.431 --> 30:33.664
and-and so late in life?

30:33.733 --> 30:38.502
I suppose it starts by, uh,
never conceding that it's...

30:38.571 --> 30:40.338
late in life.

30:40.406 --> 30:43.207
Yes, I came back here
'cause I'm going

30:43.276 --> 30:45.843
to the Marine Corps
Scholarship Foundation Ball,

30:45.912 --> 30:48.012
but I admit...

30:48.081 --> 30:51.349
I miss my NCIS family.

30:51.417 --> 30:52.950
They're easy to miss.

30:53.019 --> 30:54.552
Yeah, the trouble is,

30:54.621 --> 30:57.388
I'm not sure there's
a place for me here.

30:57.457 --> 31:02.727
Uh, Dr. Palmer is
a exceptional medical examiner

31:02.795 --> 31:06.197
who has every right
to resent my return.

31:06.266 --> 31:09.166
I daresay I might
feel the same way

31:09.235 --> 31:11.402
if the roles were reversed.

31:11.471 --> 31:14.171
No. No, you wouldn't.

31:16.142 --> 31:19.410
And for the record,
I have never resented you.

31:19.479 --> 31:21.545
Dr. Palmer, it's all right.

31:21.614 --> 31:23.581
- I...
- No, no, Doctor.

31:23.650 --> 31:25.983
I was rude and curt
with you earlier,

31:26.052 --> 31:28.753
but it's only because
I didn't want you to see me

31:28.821 --> 31:31.022
making the biggest mistake
of my life.

31:31.090 --> 31:32.890
I have brought shame

31:32.959 --> 31:35.926
on our profession in a way that,
frankly, you never would have.

31:35.995 --> 31:38.863
Oh, that's a bunch of baloney.

31:38.931 --> 31:42.233
You were just trying to be a
good, uh, son-in-law to Groucho,

31:42.302 --> 31:45.436
and you still ended up
doing everything right.

31:45.505 --> 31:48.439
Jimmy, you are an honorable man.

31:48.508 --> 31:50.274
There's no way

31:50.343 --> 31:52.843
you could bring shame
to this profession.

31:53.846 --> 31:55.780
Bring it in.

32:01.054 --> 32:03.220
Damn place gets me every time.

32:06.659 --> 32:09.126
Kase. What do we got?

32:09.195 --> 32:11.128
We've got a match, Gibbs.

32:11.197 --> 32:12.963
Two days of running
facial recognition

32:13.032 --> 32:14.965
has finally given
us a face.

32:15.034 --> 32:16.600
Kenneth Dent, pictured here

32:16.669 --> 32:19.737
after his 2011 arrest
for drunk and disorderly

32:19.806 --> 32:21.238
as a junior at
Towson University.

32:21.307 --> 32:23.207
Yeah. That's our Kenny.
Where is he now?

32:23.276 --> 32:24.642
Towson has no idea.

32:24.711 --> 32:26.243
He flunked out shortly after,

32:26.312 --> 32:28.479
and they have no record
of his current whereabouts.

32:28.548 --> 32:31.126
- Shouldn't be too hard to find.
- But it might be with <i>that</i> name,

32:31.150 --> 32:33.384
'cause-- and here's
where it gets good--

32:33.453 --> 32:35.920
I dug deeper
to find that Kenneth Dent

32:35.988 --> 32:38.656
is actually a registered alias,

32:38.725 --> 32:40.624
given for security purposes

32:40.693 --> 32:42.893
due to his wealthy family

32:42.962 --> 32:44.962
in Singapore.

32:45.031 --> 32:46.731
Ever heard the name...
Henry Deng?

32:46.799 --> 32:48.332
Way to blow my big reveal.

32:48.401 --> 32:49.333
How are they related?

32:49.402 --> 32:51.168
Oh, Henry's youngest son.

32:51.237 --> 32:54.105
Kenneth Dent
is actually Keung Deng,

32:54.173 --> 32:57.108
<i>youngest heir</i>
<i>to the Deng fortune and empire.</i>

32:57.176 --> 33:00.111
Singapore consulate
says Keung Deng,

33:00.179 --> 33:01.946
aka Kenny Dent,

33:02.014 --> 33:04.215
has no permanent U.S. residence.

33:04.250 --> 33:07.551
It seems he moves from one
luxury hotel to the next.

33:07.587 --> 33:09.954
Currently checked in
at the D.C. Biltmore.

33:10.022 --> 33:11.756
Well, or checked out.

33:11.824 --> 33:15.259
Biltmore said his credit cards
were cancelled as of yesterday.

33:15.328 --> 33:18.162
BOLO. Every airport,
every border.

33:18.231 --> 33:19.742
Maybe Henry caught wind
of his son's crimes

33:19.766 --> 33:21.132
and cut him off?

33:21.200 --> 33:22.967
Ask Henry Deng.

33:23.035 --> 33:24.675
Boss, that's easier
said than done.

33:24.737 --> 33:26.081
He's pretty high up
on the food chain.

33:26.105 --> 33:27.304
I'll handle that, McGee.

33:27.373 --> 33:28.305
We've got a
missing suspect

33:28.374 --> 33:29.673
who's broke

33:29.742 --> 33:32.543
and likely holding
Jimmy's brother-in-law.

33:32.612 --> 33:33.892
That might be his only leverage.

33:33.946 --> 33:35.112
Unless he still
has his game.

33:35.181 --> 33:36.747
Oh, that's right.
The high-stakes game.

33:36.816 --> 33:37.882
How do we find it?

33:37.950 --> 33:39.650
I might be able
to help with that.

33:39.719 --> 33:40.951
Hey! Chief!

33:41.754 --> 33:42.787
Gibbs.
How are you?

33:42.855 --> 33:43.788
- Good to see you.
- Good to see you.

33:43.856 --> 33:44.856
- Thanks.
- Hey.

33:44.924 --> 33:46.204
We heard
you were lurking around.

33:46.259 --> 33:48.793
Oh, Ellie, never lurking.

33:48.861 --> 33:50.728
Strutting, baby, strutting.

33:50.797 --> 33:52.696
How do you help us?

33:52.765 --> 33:54.331
I know people who know people.

33:54.400 --> 33:56.500
I could make a few calls.

33:56.569 --> 33:57.902
Yeah.

33:57.970 --> 34:01.739
Um, if I find the game, Gibbs,

34:01.808 --> 34:03.507
don't, uh...

34:03.576 --> 34:05.242
don't storm the castle.

34:05.311 --> 34:06.410
Okay?
Why not?

34:06.479 --> 34:08.078
Because these games,
they got security.

34:08.147 --> 34:10.080
Good guys and bad guys.

34:10.149 --> 34:12.483
Uh, it could get messy.

34:12.552 --> 34:14.717
Maybe it'd be better
if they played a few rounds

34:14.786 --> 34:17.721
until we find out if this, uh,
Kenny fellow really shows up.

34:18.791 --> 34:20.056
Start calling.

34:20.126 --> 34:22.059
Hey, Gibbs,
send me.

34:22.128 --> 34:23.393
Bishop and I
can go undercover.

34:23.463 --> 34:24.862
You know,
Charlie and Louise.

34:24.931 --> 34:27.598
Um, no, I don't know
anything about poker.

34:27.667 --> 34:30.367
Oh, I know someone who does.

34:32.304 --> 34:34.371
<i>So, I beat Gibbs</i>

34:34.440 --> 34:36.907
at one of his friendly home
poker games, and now he thinks

34:36.976 --> 34:38.742
I'm, like, the Cincinnati Kid.

34:38.811 --> 34:41.846
Oh, so, uh, Gibbs has,
uh, games at his house?

34:41.914 --> 34:45.049
I'm sure you'll...
be invited next time.

34:45.117 --> 34:46.283
Here we go.

34:49.621 --> 34:51.388
- Good evening.
- Please, come in.

34:51.456 --> 34:52.723
Thank you.

34:52.792 --> 34:55.860
Oh, this is gonna be good.

34:55.928 --> 34:58.229
Hmm?

34:58.297 --> 34:59.430
Oh, hello.

34:59.499 --> 35:00.431
It's not him.

35:00.500 --> 35:02.933
Uh, pardon,

35:03.002 --> 35:04.346
who's the "him"
you're talking about?

35:04.370 --> 35:05.302
Never mind.

35:05.371 --> 35:06.570
Who referred you?

35:06.639 --> 35:08.038
Anthony DiNozzo.

35:08.107 --> 35:09.139
Sweet Tony.

35:09.208 --> 35:10.641
But I'm afraid the game's

35:10.710 --> 35:12.521
been cancelled tonight.
- We could've guessed that.

35:12.545 --> 35:14.411
Ooh, let's guess again.

35:14.480 --> 35:16.213
You're waiting for Kenny Dent.

35:16.282 --> 35:17.882
- You know where he is?
- We were hoping

35:17.950 --> 35:19.817
to find him here.
So were we.

35:19.886 --> 35:21.452
He owes money
to everyone in this room.

35:21.521 --> 35:23.420
Ah, that explains the guns.

35:23.489 --> 35:25.723
But word on the street is
he's already skipped town.

35:25.791 --> 35:27.157
Damn.

35:27.226 --> 35:28.426
Well, since we're
already here,

35:28.494 --> 35:30.461
might as well play a
hand or two, you know?

35:31.564 --> 35:32.663
Fine.

35:32.732 --> 35:35.633
All right, we're gonna need
some gun permits.

35:43.988 --> 35:46.522
How about a donut, huh?

35:46.590 --> 35:47.523
Danish?

35:47.591 --> 35:49.124
Apple fritter?

35:49.193 --> 35:50.325
What, no bear claws?

35:50.394 --> 35:51.760
Stop apologizing, Jimmy.

35:51.829 --> 35:53.162
You're making it worse.

35:53.230 --> 35:55.097
I just feel so bad
that my family dysfunction

35:55.166 --> 35:56.498
is causing
all this trouble.

35:56.567 --> 35:58.267
Palmer, you're
our family.

35:58.335 --> 35:59.635
You're worth the trouble, okay?

35:59.703 --> 36:00.969
Now, go get us
some bear claws.

36:01.038 --> 36:03.005
- Autopsy results?
- Oh, right.

36:03.073 --> 36:05.174
The knife wounds
on both Petty Officer Braddish

36:05.242 --> 36:07.176
and Peter Liu are a match,

36:07.244 --> 36:08.510
but there's nothing to confirm

36:08.579 --> 36:10.223
that it was Kenny Deng
who did the stabbing.

36:10.247 --> 36:12.327
- Still no Kenny Deng?
- No. Still in the wind, boss.

36:12.383 --> 36:14.316
We've got BOLOs out
all over the Northeast,

36:14.385 --> 36:15.385
so he can't get far.

36:15.453 --> 36:16.693
Yeah, unless he's already gone.

36:16.754 --> 36:18.353
Yeah, along with Stevie.

36:18.422 --> 36:19.855
Uh, hey, Gibbs?

36:19.924 --> 36:22.658
Henry Deng.
Conference room.

36:22.726 --> 36:25.160
Seriously, boss?
You got him?

36:25.229 --> 36:26.995
The Chief.

36:27.064 --> 36:28.797
He knows people.

36:30.201 --> 36:31.300
<i>Understand, Agents,</i>

36:31.368 --> 36:33.202
this meeting is
a diplomatic courtesy.

36:33.270 --> 36:37.239
Mr. Deng is pleased
that he happened to be in D.C.

36:37.308 --> 36:38.640
negotiating a merger.

36:38.709 --> 36:40.576
Well, we are
quite pleased as well.

36:40.644 --> 36:42.544
And I am eager to
clear my son's name.

36:42.613 --> 36:44.813
Any mistake Keung made
was surely

36:44.882 --> 36:46.682
in self-defense.
- You know what your son did?

36:48.552 --> 36:51.487
Only what he's accused of.

36:51.555 --> 36:53.589
Your son killed
a U.S. Navy seaman.

36:53.657 --> 36:56.859
Perhaps this was
a mistake.

36:56.927 --> 36:59.194
You think my son is a murderer?

36:59.263 --> 37:00.762
Yeah, and he's also a kidnapper.

37:00.831 --> 37:04.566
Mind you, he only kidnapped
to cover up the murder, so...

37:04.635 --> 37:06.413
You sent your dry cleaner buddy
to help your son,

37:06.437 --> 37:07.936
and your son killed him, too.

37:09.273 --> 37:12.040
That's when you punished him,
cut him off.

37:12.109 --> 37:15.177
But have you washed
your hands entirely, Mr. Deng?

37:16.413 --> 37:19.681
Helping a suspect
to flee the country--

37:19.750 --> 37:21.783
we call that aiding
and abetting, sir.

37:21.852 --> 37:23.719
I have no idea
of what you believe,

37:23.787 --> 37:25.621
nor my son's whereabouts.

37:25.689 --> 37:28.290
Amazing.
The parental dynamic.

37:28.359 --> 37:30.959
Some folks are too tough
on their kids.

37:31.028 --> 37:34.563
Others are
not nearly tough enough.

37:34.632 --> 37:36.632
Which one are you, Mr. Deng?

37:38.035 --> 37:40.102
I'm afraid that ends
our meeting.

37:40.170 --> 37:41.403
Okay.

37:41.472 --> 37:42.704
Gibbs.

37:49.980 --> 37:51.613
And who is this?

37:51.682 --> 37:53.448
Ed Slater, Mr. Deng.

37:53.517 --> 37:55.717
Another father
with a son in trouble.

37:55.786 --> 37:57.252
I couldn't
help but hear

37:57.321 --> 37:59.121
Agent Sloane's question
through the door.

37:59.189 --> 38:02.457
Afraid I fall into the
"not tough enough" category.

38:02.526 --> 38:04.426
Funny how we get this picture
in our heads

38:04.495 --> 38:07.329
of what our kids might become.

38:07.398 --> 38:09.765
Give them every chance,
bailing them out of trouble

38:09.833 --> 38:11.133
over and over,

38:11.201 --> 38:13.135
hoping this incident
will be the one that flips

38:13.203 --> 38:16.305
the switch in their heads
so they might finally

38:16.373 --> 38:17.973
turn that
elusive corner.

38:18.042 --> 38:19.241
And when they don't,

38:19.310 --> 38:21.310
hell, I even resent
other kids

38:21.378 --> 38:23.478
who seem to have it
all together,

38:23.547 --> 38:27.015
wondering why my son
can't be more like them.

38:29.987 --> 38:32.507
Tell him why you didn't cremate
the body like you were told, Ed.

38:36.060 --> 38:37.459
I figured the
only thing worse

38:37.528 --> 38:38.794
than losing a child

38:38.862 --> 38:41.296
would be
to have one simply vanish

38:41.365 --> 38:44.299
and never be found.

38:44.368 --> 38:46.034
I'm begging
you, sir.

38:46.103 --> 38:48.837
If you know where my son is,
please tell us.

38:50.708 --> 38:52.674
Is my Stevie alive?

38:52.743 --> 38:54.109
Is he safe?

38:54.178 --> 38:56.044
I just need to know.

38:56.113 --> 38:58.480
Please.

39:09.927 --> 39:11.393
Kenny, can we please talk
about this?

39:11.462 --> 39:12.582
All you do is
talk. I'm done.

39:12.630 --> 39:14.329
No, no, no, no, no,
please, please!

39:14.398 --> 39:15.631
Just listen to me.

39:15.699 --> 39:16.865
I-I won't say anything.

39:16.934 --> 39:18.200
I swear to God.

39:20.471 --> 39:21.970
No, Kenny!

39:22.039 --> 39:23.538
Kenny!

39:23.607 --> 39:25.407
Please!
NCIS.

39:28.445 --> 39:30.379
Help!

39:30.447 --> 39:31.747
Help!

39:31.815 --> 39:33.915
Help!

39:33.984 --> 39:36.985
Oh, thank God.
Thank you.

39:38.155 --> 39:41.923
Oh, man.
Thank you, guys, so much.

40:12.823 --> 40:14.956
Dad? Jimmy?

40:14.992 --> 40:17.059
Stevie, thank God
you're okay!

40:17.127 --> 40:18.927
Thank you, Jimmy.
I-I knew you'd come save me.

40:18.996 --> 40:20.862
I-I kept praying.

40:20.931 --> 40:22.764
It's okay, it's okay.
I kept praying.

40:22.833 --> 40:25.434
Stevie, it was your dad.

40:25.502 --> 40:27.436
He's the one
you should be thanking.

40:27.504 --> 40:29.104
No, Jimmy, it was you.

40:29.173 --> 40:30.372
Thank you, son.

40:40.718 --> 40:44.052
Now it feels like
a real prom.

40:44.121 --> 40:46.755
The Marine Corps Scholarship
Foundation ball

40:46.824 --> 40:49.925
is far better
than any prom, Anthony.

40:49.993 --> 40:51.753
And you're extremely
fortunate to be my date.

40:51.795 --> 40:52.961
Don't I know it.

40:53.030 --> 40:54.496
But I would
prefer "wingman,"

40:54.565 --> 40:55.497
if you don't mind.

40:55.566 --> 40:57.065
Ah, yes, I forget.

40:57.134 --> 40:58.467
We're going to be hitting

40:58.535 --> 41:01.136
some of his favorite
night spots afterwards.

41:01.205 --> 41:03.271
We'd invite you
to come along, Gibbs,

41:03.340 --> 41:05.107
but you're a bit young
for this crowd.

41:05.175 --> 41:07.609
And who needs the competition?

41:07.678 --> 41:08.977
Long as you have protection.

41:09.046 --> 41:10.612
Don't leave home without it.
Yeah.

41:10.681 --> 41:13.014
Start the car.
I'll be right out.

41:13.083 --> 41:15.617
Uh, keep the phone
by your bed, Gibbs.

41:15.686 --> 41:17.452
We may need you
to post bail.

41:17.521 --> 41:19.154
Good night, Chief.

41:23.360 --> 41:24.860
Good to go?

41:24.928 --> 41:27.662
What
an appropriate choice of words.

41:27.731 --> 41:29.164
Something on your mind?

41:30.667 --> 41:32.601
No, no. Not now.

41:32.669 --> 41:34.369
Perhaps tomorrow.

41:34.438 --> 41:36.204
What are you planning
after tomorrow?

41:36.273 --> 41:38.507
I'm-I'm not entirely sure.

41:38.575 --> 41:41.643
But one thing I am certain of...

41:42.746 --> 41:44.146
...my future

41:44.214 --> 41:48.324
will no longer include NCIS.

41:50.007 --> 41:53.054
Jethro, I've done
all I have to do.

41:53.423 --> 41:55.790
It's time for Dr. Palmer

41:55.859 --> 42:00.428
to be the permanent
chief medical examiner.

42:03.233 --> 42:06.668
I'm sorry.

42:06.736 --> 42:08.670
Good night.
