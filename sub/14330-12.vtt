10:35.835 --> 10:37.103
- NONSENSE, POOF.

10:37.169 --> 10:38.337
THE PLAYPEN IS NOT

10:38.404 --> 10:40.873
AND INTERDIMENSIONAL VORTEX
OF DOOM.

10:40.940 --> 10:42.808
- WANDA, STOP!

10:42.875 --> 10:44.377
STOP, FOOP.

10:44.443 --> 10:46.445
I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE UP TO.

THE PLAYPEN
REALLY IS A VORTEX OF DOOM.

11:00.226 --> 11:01.827
POOF WAS TELLING THE TRUTH.

11:01.894 --> 11:03.362
- GOOD-BYE, POOF.

11:03.429 --> 11:06.432

THIS IS ALL YOUR FAULT.

11:20.079 --> 11:20.946
REALLY?
I BLAME YOU.

11:21.013 --> 11:21.981
WELL, YOU WOULD.

11:22.048 --> 11:23.215
THAT'S SO LIKE YOU.

11:23.282 --> 11:24.717
I'LL GET YOU, POOF!

I DIDN'T BELIEVE YOU.

11:32.024 --> 11:33.726
CAN YOU FORGIVE ME?

11:33.793 --> 11:35.561

11:43.335 --> 11:47.206
- AND WE DON'T HAVE TO WORRY
ABOUT FOOP ANYMORE.

11:47.273 --> 11:48.774
- YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE LAST
OF ME, POOF.

11:48.841 --> 11:49.809
OR ME EITHER.

11:49.875 --> 11:50.843
I KNOW THAT; I'M RIGHT HERE.

11:50.910 --> 11:51.844
I WAS TALKING TO THEM.

11:51.911 --> 11:53.412
OH, PIPE DOWN!

11:53.479 --> 11:55.381
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO GOT US
INTO THIS IN THE FIRST PLACE.

11:55.448 --> 11:56.682
WE'LL BE BACK.

11:56.749 --> 11:58.284
STOP LOOKING AT ME!

11:58.350 --> 12:01.020
I HATE BEETS!

12:01.087 --> 12:02.221
SO DO I!

12:16.402 --> 12:18.904
[bell ringing]

12:18.971 --> 12:21.207
- TAKE YOUR TIME
FINISHING YOUR TEST, CLASS.

12:21.273 --> 12:22.408
EXCEPT YOU, TURNER!

12:22.475 --> 12:23.843
YOU GET TEN SECONDS.

12:23.909 --> 12:25.277
TEN, NINE...

12:25.344 --> 12:28.147

12:29.281 --> 12:30.216
[pencil vibrating]

12:30.282 --> 12:32.351
- OH, NO, MY PENCIL BROKE.

12:32.418 --> 12:33.686
- NO PROBLEM, TIMMY.

12:33.752 --> 12:36.122
WE CAN FINISH YOUR TEST
FOR YOU.

12:36.188 --> 12:38.357
- COSMO, YOU CAN'T TAKE
TIMMY'S TEST.

12:38.424 --> 12:39.725
THAT'S CHEATING.

12:39.792 --> 12:41.694
- NOT IF YOU DON'T KNOW
THE ANSWERS.

12:41.760 --> 12:44.630
LOOK, I MADE A SCARY CLOWN
WITH CRAB HANDS.

12:44.697 --> 12:46.098
- NOW YOU'RE GONNA
MAKE HIM FAIL.

12:46.165 --> 12:48.901
BESIDES, CLOWNS HAVE BIG SHOES
LIKE THIS.

12:48.968 --> 12:50.603
[laughter]

12:50.669 --> 12:52.905
- TIME'S UP!
PENCILS DOWN!

12:52.972 --> 12:54.473
WELL, TURNER,

12:54.540 --> 12:56.742
SINCE YOUR GRAVITY-DEFYING
WRITING IMPLEMENTS

12:56.809 --> 12:58.477
INSISTS ON DISOBEYING ME,

12:58.544 --> 12:59.812
I'LL LOCK THEM AWAY
IN MY DRAWER

12:59.879 --> 13:01.347
OF OPEN FLAMES AND MOUSE TRAPS.

WANDA.

13:05.784 --> 13:08.120
YOU PEOPLE ARE MONSTERS!

13:08.187 --> 13:10.122
- A SCARY CLOWN WITH CRAB HANDS?

13:10.189 --> 13:11.357
TURNER!

13:11.423 --> 13:12.892
WHY CAN'T YOU BE MORE
LIKE A.J. HERE?

13:12.958 --> 13:14.226
HE NEVER DRAWS PICTURES,

13:14.293 --> 13:15.728
AND HIS PENCILS DON'T FLOAT.

13:15.794 --> 13:17.563
HE'S MY BESTEST STUDENT.

13:17.630 --> 13:19.465
- THAT'S "BEST STUDENT,"
MR. CROCKER.

13:19.532 --> 13:20.900
- SEE HOW SMART HE IS?

13:20.966 --> 13:22.935
DON'T CROSS ME IN PUBLIC AGAIN.

13:23.002 --> 13:24.236

[fanfare]

13:27.006 --> 13:28.774

HE'S AMAZING!

13:28.841 --> 13:29.775
WATCH THIS.

13:29.842 --> 13:31.043
A.J., BUILD ME A TIME MACHINE

13:36.248 --> 13:39.118
[dials trilling]
[zapping noise]

OUT OF PAPER CLIPS AND YARN.

13:42.855 --> 13:44.089

13:44.156 --> 13:46.492
A.J., TAKE THE REST
OF THE SCHOOL YEAR OFF.

13:50.162 --> 13:51.130
WHATEVER YOU DO,

13:51.197 --> 13:52.831
DON'T CLONE AN APPLE!

13:52.898 --> 13:53.866
- IT'S TOO LATE.

13:53.933 --> 13:54.867
- AAGH!

13:54.934 --> 13:55.901
- AAGH!

13:55.968 --> 13:57.169
WAH!

13:57.236 --> 13:58.270
- SEE YA NEXT YEAR, A.J.

13:58.337 --> 13:59.405
STAY COOL.

13:59.471 --> 14:01.540
- MAN, A.J.'S SO LUCKY.

14:01.607 --> 14:03.342
HE GETS THE REST
OF THE YEAR OFF.

14:03.409 --> 14:05.711
I WISH I WERE
THE TEACHER'S PET.

14:05.778 --> 14:06.679
- [laughs]

14:06.745 --> 14:08.214

- A CUTE LITTLE GUINEA PIG.

14:19.758 --> 14:22.761
A.J. MUST HAVE MADE YOU
OUT OF PAPER CLIPS AND YARN.

14:22.828 --> 14:24.697
OH, I'M GONNA TAKE YOU HOME
AND PET YOU

14:24.763 --> 14:26.498
AND FEED YOU YUMMY TREATS...

14:26.565 --> 14:28.434
- MAYBE THIS ISN'T SO BAD.

14:28.500 --> 14:30.769
- AND THEN SUBJECT YOU
TO DIABOLICAL EXPERIMENTS!

14:30.836 --> 14:31.804
- [teeth chattering]

14:31.870 --> 14:33.072

WELCOME TO THE CROCKER CAVE,

14:44.883 --> 14:46.518
MY DOOMED LITTLE FRIEND.

14:46.585 --> 14:48.654
I'M GOING TO USE
THE DNA OF THESE LAB ANIMALS

14:48.721 --> 14:50.589
TO GENETICALLY TRANSFORM MYSELF

14:50.656 --> 14:53.359
INTO THE PERFECT
FAIRY-HUNTING CREATURE.

14:53.425 --> 14:54.893
I'LL HAVE THE NOSE
OF A BLOODHOUND

14:54.960 --> 14:56.328
TO SNIFF OUT FAIRIES!

14:56.395 --> 14:58.631
THE WINGS OF A BUMBLEBEE
TO SWOOP DOWN ON...

14:58.697 --> 14:59.698
FAIRIES!

14:59.765 --> 15:01.567
THE ARMOR OF AN ARMADILLO

15:01.634 --> 15:03.302
TO SHIELD ME
FROM THE MAGIC OF...

15:03.369 --> 15:04.870
FAIRIES!

15:04.937 --> 15:06.872
THE CHEEK POUCHES OF A CHIPMUNK
TO HOLD MY CAPTURED...

15:06.939 --> 15:08.073
FAIRIES!

15:08.140 --> 15:10.276
AND THE FLUFFY HAIR
OF A PERSIAN CAT.

15:10.342 --> 15:11.777
THE HAIR WON'T HELP ME CATCH--
FAIRIES!

15:11.844 --> 15:13.746
BUT IT'LL MAKE ME
A REAL CHICK MAGNET.

15:13.812 --> 15:15.648
BUT BEFORE I SUBJECT MYSELF

15:15.714 --> 15:17.549
TO A POTENTIALLY
DEADLY EXPERIMENT,

15:17.616 --> 15:19.818
I'LL NEED TO TEST IT OUT
ON A GUINEA PIG.

15:19.885 --> 15:22.087
THAT'S WHERE YOU COME IN.

15:22.154 --> 15:23.989
NOW TO HOOK YOU UP
TO MY MACHINE,

15:24.056 --> 15:26.659
WHICH WILL SUCK THE DNA
FROM ALL THESE ANIMALS.

15:26.725 --> 15:28.027
I NAMED IT "MOTHER,"

15:28.093 --> 15:30.095
AFTER THE PERSON WHO SUCKED
THE LIFE OUT OF ME.

15:30.162 --> 15:32.097
- WAIT, YOU CAN'T DO THIS.

15:32.164 --> 15:33.499
- OH, WELL, WHAT DO YOU KNOW?

15:33.565 --> 15:35.968
A GUINEA PIG THAT SOUNDS
LIKE TIMMY TURNER.

15:36.035 --> 15:37.870
NOW I'M GOING TO ENJOY THIS
EVEN MORE.

15:37.936 --> 15:39.038
blast!

15:39.104 --> 15:41.140
- COSMO, THE COAST IS CLEAR.

15:41.206 --> 15:42.541
- NOT ONLY THAT,

15:42.608 --> 15:43.776
BUT EVERYONE'S GONE.

15:43.842 --> 15:45.978
- POOF, WHERE'S TIMMY?

15:46.045 --> 15:46.945
- POOF-POOF!

15:47.012 --> 15:48.647
[gibberish talk]

15:48.714 --> 15:50.816
- OH, NO, HE SAYS CANADA'S
BEING ATTACKED

15:50.883 --> 15:52.518
BY SPACE OYSTERS.

15:52.584 --> 15:55.821
- COSMO, HE SAID HE TURNED TIMMY
INTO A GUINEA PIG

15:55.888 --> 15:58.357
AND MR. CROCKER TOOK HIM
TO HIS LAB.

15:58.424 --> 16:00.059
- CANADA, YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN.

16:00.125 --> 16:01.760
WE HAVE TO SAVE TIMMY
RIGHT AWAY.

16:01.827 --> 16:03.562
HEY, LOOK, A TIME MACHINE.

16:03.629 --> 16:04.897
WHAT'S THIS BUTTON DO?

16:04.963 --> 16:06.065

16:09.134 --> 16:11.070
[ominous music]

16:11.136 --> 16:13.405
- HOPEFULLY, MY EXPERIMENT
WILL WORK ON YOU.

16:13.472 --> 16:15.074
EARLIER I HOOKED MOTHER UP
TO MOTHER,

16:15.140 --> 16:17.443
BUT SHE GOT A LITTLE
TOO MUCH BLOODHOUND.

16:17.509 --> 16:21.447
- [tortured howling]

16:21.513 --> 16:23.849
- THAT'S ONE FREAKY BLOODHOUND.

MY TURN!

16:43.669 --> 16:45.471
[intense zapping noises]

16:48.307 --> 16:51.176

16:51.243 --> 16:52.444
- [coughing]

16:52.511 --> 16:53.412
[gasps]

16:56.982 --> 16:58.417
- IT WORKED!

16:58.484 --> 17:00.819
I'M A PERSIAN BUBBLE
CHIP-A-DILLO HOUND.

17:00.886 --> 17:02.921
OH, I HOPE THE PET STORE

17:11.763 --> 17:14.333
DEH!
DUGH!

17:14.400 --> 17:15.401
NOTE TO SELF:

17:15.467 --> 17:17.569
NEXT TIME GO WITH EAGLE WINGS.

17:17.636 --> 17:18.971
- COSMO, WANDA!

17:21.306 --> 17:22.574
- WHAT'S THIS BUTTON DO?

17:22.641 --> 17:23.842
[zapping noise]

17:23.909 --> 17:25.243
WHAT'S THIS BUTTON DO?

17:25.310 --> 17:26.377
AH-AH!

17:26.444 --> 17:29.048
- COSMO, WE HAVE TO RESCUE
TIMMY.

17:29.114 --> 17:31.250
poof!

17:31.316 --> 17:33.118
- GUYS, MR. CROCKER
TURNED HIMSELF

17:33.185 --> 17:34.987
INTO A FAIRY-CATCHING MONSTER.

17:35.053 --> 17:37.322
HE'S GONNA CAPTURE
EVERY FAIRY IN TOWN.

17:37.389 --> 17:39.258
- PUT A SOCK IN IT, GUINEA PIG.

17:39.324 --> 17:40.592
WE'RE LOOKING FOR TIMMY.

17:40.659 --> 17:43.195

17:43.262 --> 17:44.696
[light chimes]

17:44.763 --> 17:47.099
- WE HAVE TO FIND MR. CROCKER
BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.

17:47.166 --> 17:49.635
YOU KNOW WHERE ALL THE FAIRIES
IN TOWN LIVE, RIGHT?

17:49.701 --> 17:51.170
- WELL, SURE,
WE'VE GOT THEIR ADDRESSES

17:51.236 --> 17:53.005
IN OUR FAIRY BERRIES.

17:53.071 --> 17:55.774
THE CLOSEST FAIRY
IS JUANDISSIMO.

17:55.841 --> 17:57.976
WE'VE GOT TO GET
TO REMI BUXOPLENTY'S HOUSE.

17:58.043 --> 18:00.345
[rousing bugle music]

18:00.412 --> 18:01.747
- THIS IS TOTALLY AWESOME.

18:01.814 --> 18:04.383
I CAN FLY!

18:04.450 --> 18:05.317
DAH!
DUEEY!

18:05.384 --> 18:06.552
WELL, KIND OF.

18:06.618 --> 18:08.320
I HAVE SUPER STRETCHY
CHIPMUNK CHEEKS

18:08.387 --> 18:10.055
AND A FULL HEAD OF CAT HAIR.

18:10.122 --> 18:11.490
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MY LIFE,

18:11.557 --> 18:13.459
I DON'T FEEL LIKE A FREAK.

[sniffing]

18:14.526 --> 18:15.761
HELLO.

18:15.828 --> 18:18.297

[wings buzzing]

18:23.202 --> 18:25.804
- I SO ENJOY LOOKING
AT MYSELF IN THE MIRROR.

18:25.871 --> 18:27.773
IT TURNS JUANDISSIMO INTO...

18:27.840 --> 18:29.475
TWO DISSIMOS.

18:29.541 --> 18:31.910
- YOU'RE MINE, MUSCLE-BOY.

18:31.977 --> 18:33.912
NOW TO STUFF YOU
IN MY CHIPMUNK CHEEKS.

18:33.979 --> 18:35.514
HARUGH!

18:35.581 --> 18:36.915

18:36.982 --> 18:39.184
I SEE THIS PERSIAN BUMBLE
CHIP-A-DILLO HOUND

18:39.251 --> 18:41.053
IS A STRANGER TO MOUTHWASH.

18:41.119 --> 18:42.321
- SUCCESS.

18:42.387 --> 18:44.957
HA, NOW TO SWOOP OFF
AND CATCH ANOTHER...

18:45.023 --> 18:46.291
FAIRY!

18:46.358 --> 18:47.626
[wings buzzing]

18:47.693 --> 18:49.528
[loud thuds]

18:49.595 --> 18:53.031
CURSE YOU, STUPID TINY
BEE WINGS!

18:53.098 --> 18:54.266
- WE'RE TOO LATE.

18:54.333 --> 18:56.268
WE HAVE TO WARN
THE OTHER FAIRIES.

18:56.335 --> 18:57.603
- LET'S SPLIT UP.

18:57.669 --> 19:00.372
I'LL TAKE TIMMY, WANDA, POOF,
AND COSMO.

19:01.640 --> 19:03.575
- GOOD PLAN, LET'S GO.

19:03.642 --> 19:06.478
[up-tempo swing music]

19:06.545 --> 19:07.846

[laughing crazily]

19:41.880 --> 19:43.115
- THERE HE IS, GUYS.

19:43.181 --> 19:46.552
I WISH MR. CROCKER
WAS BACK TO NORMAL.

19:46.618 --> 19:49.788
[loud zapping noise]

19:49.855 --> 19:52.090
[all shouting]

19:52.157 --> 19:55.060
- TIMMY, BY ANY CHANCE
IS MR. CROCKER

19:55.127 --> 19:56.828
PART ARMADILLO?

19:56.895 --> 19:58.163
- OH, COME ON.

19:58.230 --> 19:59.665
DON'T TELL ME ARMADILLO ARMOR

19:59.731 --> 20:02.034
REALLY DOES SHIELD HIM
FROM FAIRY MAGIC.

20:02.100 --> 20:03.869
- OKAY, WE WON'T TELL YOU.

20:03.936 --> 20:05.203
[whistling]

20:05.270 --> 20:07.339
- AND NOW FOR PHASE TWO
OF MY PLAN,

20:07.406 --> 20:09.141
I'M GOING TO HOOK YOU--
FAIRIES!

20:09.207 --> 20:10.809
UP TO MY DNA MACHINE.

20:10.876 --> 20:12.110
- OH, NO.

20:12.177 --> 20:13.612
MR. CROCKER'S GONNA DRAIN
THE FAIRIES

20:13.679 --> 20:14.880
OF THEIR MAGIC.

20:14.947 --> 20:16.248
- WE HAVE TO STOP HIM,

20:16.315 --> 20:19.952
OR HE'LL BECOME A TOTALLY
INVINCIBLE SUPER FAIRY.

20:20.018 --> 20:22.621
- OUR ONLY CHANCE IS TO BEAT
MR. CROCKER BACK TO HIS LAB.

20:22.688 --> 20:25.123
WE HAVE TO DISTRACT HIM
AND BUY SOME TIME.

20:25.190 --> 20:26.892
- WELL, HE'S PART BLOODHOUND,
RIGHT?

20:26.959 --> 20:29.294
SO I'LL JUST POOF INTO SOMETHING
NO DOG CAN RESIST.

20:29.361 --> 20:30.262
poof!

20:31.597 --> 20:33.098
- THE FIRE HYDRANT!

20:33.165 --> 20:35.133
OH, I CAN'T RESIST.
YAY!

20:35.200 --> 20:37.603
- UH-OH, MAYBE I SHOULD HAVE
GONE WITH A CHEW TOY.

20:37.669 --> 20:39.638
YAH-AH-AH-AH-AH!

20:41.039 --> 20:43.442
- TIME TO DO
A LITTLE REWIRING.

20:45.077 --> 20:47.980
[zapping noises]

20:49.648 --> 20:52.751
- WELL, THE GOOD NEWS IS,
I BOUGHT US SOME TIME.

20:52.818 --> 20:55.654
THE BAD NEWS IS TOO HORRIBLE
TO TALK ABOUT.

20:55.721 --> 20:56.655
[muffled whimpering]

20:56.722 --> 20:57.756
- [laughing crazily]

20:57.823 --> 21:00.592
- HE'S COMING!
HIDE!

21:02.694 --> 21:03.795
- AND NOW TO DRAIN YOUR...

21:03.862 --> 21:05.097
FAIRY DNA!

21:05.163 --> 21:07.099
AND TRANSFORM MYSELF
INTO THE KING OF ALL...

21:07.165 --> 21:08.300
FAIRIES!

21:08.367 --> 21:09.635
HMM, NOT QUITE
AS OMINOUS-SOUNDING

21:09.701 --> 21:10.669
AS I HAD HOPED.

21:10.736 --> 21:11.670
HOW ABOUT...

21:11.737 --> 21:13.538
THE BIGGEST FAIRY EVER!

21:13.605 --> 21:14.539
NO, THAT'S WORSE.

21:14.606 --> 21:18.076
WHATEVER.

21:18.143 --> 21:20.212
- OH, THANK GOODNESS
WE ARE OUT.

21:20.278 --> 21:23.448
IT WAS LIKE A PORT-A-POTTY
WITH TEETH IN THERE.

21:23.515 --> 21:26.051
- SAY GOOD-BYE TO YOUR DNA,
FAIRIES!

21:26.118 --> 21:27.519
AH!

21:27.586 --> 21:29.521
TURNER, WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

21:29.588 --> 21:32.324
- I'M TURNING YOU BACK
TO NORMAL, MR. CROCKER.

[zapping and animal noises]

21:38.530 --> 21:40.232
- AH!
I'M A CROCKEROACH.

21:50.842 --> 21:53.779
- AH!
I'M A PEACROCKER!

21:53.845 --> 21:56.281
OOH, ACTUALLY,
I KIND OF LIKE THIS LOOK.

21:56.348 --> 21:57.749
[lever trilling]

21:57.816 --> 21:59.685
blast!

22:00.852 --> 22:02.287
- I DID IT!

22:02.354 --> 22:05.123
YOU'RE BACK TO BEING
PLAIN OLD CREEPY MR. CROCKER.

22:05.190 --> 22:07.025
AND NOW I'M GONNA CUT
THE FAIRIES LOOSE,

22:07.092 --> 22:08.493
AND YOUR LAB ANIMALS TOO.

22:08.560 --> 22:09.494
[buzzing sound]

22:09.561 --> 22:11.363
[sirens wailing]

22:16.368 --> 22:18.103
- FAIRIES, ANIMALS, GET HIM!

22:18.170 --> 22:19.938
JUST STAY AWAY
FROM THE DIAPER BIN

22:20.005 --> 22:21.440
THAT IS HIS MOUTH.

22:21.506 --> 22:23.341
[heavy rumbling]

22:31.083 --> 22:32.551
- [gargling]

22:32.617 --> 22:34.219
- [roaring]

22:34.286 --> 22:37.389
[clattering and animal sounds]

22:37.456 --> 22:40.492
- YOU MADE AN ENEMY OF ME
TODAY, TURNER.

22:40.559 --> 22:42.060
[screaming]

22:42.127 --> 22:43.895
AND I'LL HAVE MY REVENGE!

22:48.500 --> 22:49.901
BUT FIRST I'M GONNA PASS OUT.

22:49.968 --> 22:51.436
HUGH-UGH, MOTHER.

22:51.503 --> 22:53.305
- TIMMY, YOUR PLAN WORKED.

22:53.371 --> 22:56.708
NOW ALL WE NEED TO DO IS FIND
THESE ANIMALS A GOOD HOME.

22:56.775 --> 22:58.143
- LEAVE THAT TO ME.

22:59.745 --> 23:00.779
- WOW!

23:00.846 --> 23:02.214
WATCHING THE ANIMAL CHANNEL

23:02.280 --> 23:05.751
ON THIS HIGH-DEFINITION TV
IS AMAZING.

23:05.817 --> 23:07.085
- YEAH, I KNOW.

23:07.152 --> 23:08.687
IT'S ALMOST LIKE I COULD
REACH OUT

23:08.754 --> 23:09.921
AND POKE THIS KANGAROO.

23:09.988 --> 23:11.423
OOF!

23:13.925 --> 23:15.794
SO REALISTIC.
