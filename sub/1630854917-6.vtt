WEBVTT

00:26.360 --> 00:30.360
-  Disappointed, yes...

00:37.480 --> 00:39.640
We are so blessed.

00:40.200 --> 00:41.720
Yes.

00:41.720 --> 00:44.160
The rains have brought new life.

00:44.160 --> 00:45.800
Thank you.

00:48.440 --> 00:53.760
Yes, thank you. Initiation means
so much more with you here.

00:53.760 --> 00:57.160
It is great that you're back
where you belong, dear.

00:57.160 --> 00:58.760
Absolutely.

00:59.480 --> 01:01.720
- What is wrong with you?
- I'm sorry.

01:03.320 --> 01:06.840
It's that girl. It's getting worse.

01:09.320 --> 01:10.920
It's time.

01:12.520 --> 01:14.360
Consider it done.

01:59.560 --> 02:01.320
Bruno, stop it.

02:02.440 --> 02:05.600
-  Hey.
- Hey, Sienna. Bar's closed.

02:05.600 --> 02:08.200
No, I came here to talk to you.

02:08.640 --> 02:10.840
- About?
- Is this your sister?

02:12.840 --> 02:14.280
Where did you--
Where did you find this?

02:14.280 --> 02:16.000
When did she get sick?

02:16.680 --> 02:17.720
-  Sienna--
- I'm sorry.

02:17.720 --> 02:20.440
I-- I know it's personal,
but it's important.

02:24.120 --> 02:27.760
- Last year. Spring Fest.
- And when was she institutionalised?

02:28.600 --> 02:30.400
- Day after.
- At Fort Vannenburg?

02:30.400 --> 02:33.640
- Yes.
- And she's been there ever since?

02:34.200 --> 02:36.960
- Yes.
- Thanks.

02:36.960 --> 02:38.560
Sienna...

02:49.680 --> 02:52.040
- Hi.
- Hi.

02:52.040 --> 02:55.680
-  Uh, I've come to see Clara.
- Excuse me?

02:55.680 --> 02:59.760
- Clara? What room is she in?
- Oh, but you're not family.

03:00.600 --> 03:03.680
Just wanna pay her a visit.
I'm a friend of Charlton's.

03:04.520 --> 03:08.200
Oh, I'm sorry,
but she's sick and it's contagious.

03:08.200 --> 03:10.760
We don't want her
to infect the other patients.

03:10.760 --> 03:12.880
So I'm sorry, but you can't see her.

03:12.880 --> 03:16.760
But,
your mother would like to see you.

03:18.600 --> 03:22.320
- Where is she?
- She's outside. Lovely weather.

03:22.320 --> 03:23.920
Thanks.

03:48.080 --> 03:49.880
Don't look back.

03:52.680 --> 03:54.480
Do you know Clara?

03:56.520 --> 03:59.920
Mm-hm. Have you seen her?

04:07.640 --> 04:09.440
Where is she?

04:15.520 --> 04:17.960
On the ground? Is she dead?

05:04.120 --> 05:06.960
Thanks, Innocentia.
I'll take it from here.

05:20.040 --> 05:22.400
Well, well, well.

05:23.000 --> 05:24.960
What have we here?

05:25.720 --> 05:27.520
What was that?

05:28.200 --> 05:31.960
No, come back? No backchat?

05:33.640 --> 05:35.640
That's very good.

05:43.000 --> 05:44.600
No.

06:00.520 --> 06:03.760
♪ Da-da, da-dum ♪
♪ Da-da, da-dum ♪

06:03.760 --> 06:06.320

06:21.040 --> 06:24.520
Ah.

06:27.600 --> 06:31.600

07:20.240 --> 07:22.720

- Hey.

07:22.720 --> 07:26.000
I know you don't wanna
talk to me right now. I get it.

07:26.000 --> 07:27.840
- Um...
-  What is it?

07:29.480 --> 07:32.360
I just wanna make sure
what you said about the hospital.

07:32.360 --> 07:34.040
What about it?

07:35.680 --> 07:39.080
- You checked the basement, right?
-  There is no basement.

07:39.880 --> 07:43.280
- We've been through this.

07:44.360 --> 07:45.960
Okay.

07:46.600 --> 07:49.680
- So there's no basement?
-  That's what I said.

07:51.480 --> 07:53.560
Yeah. No, no basement.

07:54.360 --> 07:56.320
Just wanted to make sure.

08:10.240 --> 08:11.840
Yolanda.

08:13.080 --> 08:15.800
Favourite daughter of Jacob.

08:17.360 --> 08:19.720
May you be purified.

08:21.160 --> 08:23.360
Become clean once again.

08:25.040 --> 08:26.720
These...

08:27.680 --> 08:30.920
are the tears of life.

08:33.560 --> 08:35.600
Water is life.

08:38.600 --> 08:40.240
And you...

08:42.440 --> 08:44.640
are watered.

09:32.560 --> 09:35.560
There you go. I don't know
if it fits, but it's clean.

09:35.560 --> 09:37.920
But I'll bring your own clothes as
soon as it's been dried and ironed.

09:38.760 --> 09:40.600
It's the least I could do.

09:53.120 --> 09:54.880
Themba.

10:02.280 --> 10:04.520
Hey, Hey!

10:35.360 --> 10:37.120
Hello and welcome everyone.

10:37.920 --> 10:40.480
This is a very special night.

10:40.480 --> 10:44.280
With the breaking of the drought
and the flowing of the river.

10:44.280 --> 10:46.280
It is with God's grace

10:46.280 --> 10:49.680
that we are able to continue
our long-held tradition.

10:50.600 --> 10:52.640
Without further ado,

10:52.640 --> 10:58.360
let me introduce to you,
this year's Daughters of Jacob.

10:58.360 --> 11:01.640
- Whoo-hoo! Whoo!
- Yeah.

11:03.320 --> 11:05.120
Rosetta.

11:09.000 --> 11:10.600
Thuli.

11:19.120 --> 11:20.920
Ellie May.

11:22.360 --> 11:24.080
Thandiwe.

11:25.960 --> 11:28.080
Katherine Reese.

11:33.840 --> 11:35.560
Who me?

11:36.640 --> 11:38.480
Annika.

11:40.640 --> 11:42.520
And Lulu.

11:48.080 --> 11:53.160
There are your girls.
Now let's get the party started.

11:59.080 --> 12:01.960
- Aren't you looking handsome?
- Mm-hm.

12:03.080 --> 12:05.840
- One should do the trick?
- One.

12:06.440 --> 12:07.960
Two. To be safe.

12:07.960 --> 12:11.080
Hm, safety first, I always say.
Thank you.

12:25.440 --> 12:27.320
Wait a minute.

13:14.480 --> 13:16.240
You're not going to the dance?

13:17.000 --> 13:20.520
I'll see.

13:20.520 --> 13:22.320
Another one?

13:24.240 --> 13:26.360
Yeah. Please.

13:50.040 --> 13:53.600
- Just...
-  Okay. Okay then.

13:56.160 --> 13:59.840
Okay.
Everyone. Everyone.

13:59.840 --> 14:02.680
Um...
may I have all of your attention.

14:03.640 --> 14:05.200
Um...

14:05.200 --> 14:07.160
Yolanda Fisher.

14:14.840 --> 14:17.000
I know this is a bit sudden.

14:18.160 --> 14:21.160
But we go way back
and I've always loved you.

14:32.560 --> 14:35.480
Will you make me
the happiest man on earth...

14:36.240 --> 14:38.040
by marrying me?

15:04.640 --> 15:07.280
It is absolutely beautiful.

15:07.280 --> 15:11.280
- It's so big.
-  Of course, it's big.

15:11.280 --> 15:15.880
- Where did you get it, Max?
-  A family secret.

15:15.880 --> 15:18.480
Well, I'm so happy for you.

15:18.480 --> 15:20.840
- What is going on?
- Sienna.

15:20.840 --> 15:22.640
What are you doing?

15:24.960 --> 15:27.920
No, you can't seriously be
thinking of marrying Max.

15:27.920 --> 15:31.400
-  Hey.
- Not now, Max. Yola?

15:32.920 --> 15:35.320
- Yola, what are you doing?
- I'm getting married to Max.

15:35.320 --> 15:38.120
No, you don't even like Max.
You never have.

15:38.120 --> 15:39.360
- Things have changed.
- No.

15:39.360 --> 15:40.840
You're right. Things have changed.

15:40.840 --> 15:43.520
They did something to you in there
and they changed you.

15:43.520 --> 15:45.520
- I know what I'm doing.
- No, you don't know what you--

15:45.520 --> 15:46.600
You're making a scene.
You're drunk.

15:46.600 --> 15:48.680
-  Fuck off, Rudy.
- Go.

15:52.000 --> 15:53.600
Now.

16:21.080 --> 16:24.080
Oh, careful. Careful. Here we go.

16:24.080 --> 16:26.800
Huh-uh. Okay.
Let's-- Let's sit you down.

16:27.760 --> 16:30.160
Careful. Oh, there you go.

16:32.520 --> 16:35.120
Whoa, take a load off, huh?

16:36.440 --> 16:38.240
There we go.

16:38.240 --> 16:42.240
We gave you something just--
just to take the edge off.

16:43.000 --> 16:45.320
Just to help you relax a little bit.

16:45.320 --> 16:47.600
Yeah, you see this...

16:47.600 --> 16:50.240
There's no gays or lesbians
in my family

16:50.240 --> 16:52.760
and we're gonna keep it that way.
Okay?

16:53.760 --> 16:56.160
We are gonna straighten you out.

17:00.960 --> 17:03.080
God, you're such a tiny little thing.

17:03.840 --> 17:07.080
Yeah, okay, okay. Calm down. Yeah.

17:11.240 --> 17:13.680
You're gonna like it, trust me.

17:13.680 --> 17:15.440
Let me show you.

17:16.280 --> 17:18.040
There you go.

17:25.320 --> 17:28.680
You... fucking bitch.

17:38.840 --> 17:40.800
-  Hey.
- Hey.

17:42.520 --> 17:44.120
Thanks for coming.

17:44.600 --> 17:46.200
Sure.

18:27.200 --> 18:28.960
Find the little cunt.

19:26.560 --> 19:30.560
Hey!

19:45.880 --> 19:48.840
- Thanks for fetching me.
- Oh, yeah.

19:52.080 --> 19:53.680
Well...

19:56.200 --> 19:58.000
you wanna come inside?

19:59.160 --> 20:02.080
- Really?
- Really.

21:24.680 --> 21:29.320
Huh? Wait? Wait?
Come back.

21:59.920 --> 22:02.960
- Don't move or you lose it.
- Sienna, what is this?

22:02.960 --> 22:06.320
What did they do to Yola
in the basement?

22:40.440 --> 22:42.640
Yes! Yes!

22:49.240 --> 22:52.480
- Yola?

22:56.120 --> 22:59.240
- Yola?

22:59.240 --> 23:01.000
- Yola?

23:01.000 --> 23:03.800
Um, I'm getting you help.

24:34.360 --> 24:38.240
Sienna,
I told you there isn't-- Ah!

24:40.240 --> 24:42.360
- You lied.
- Oh, fuck. Fuck.

24:42.360 --> 24:44.600
Okay, I lied. I'm sorry.

24:44.600 --> 24:47.800
I'm an idiot.
Please don't-- Just don't...

24:49.040 --> 24:52.200
Fuck. Sienna, they didn't give
me much of a choice.

24:52.200 --> 24:55.200
This fucking town.

24:56.480 --> 24:59.560
There's no one they can't
control except you and...

25:01.480 --> 25:03.280
I love you.

27:22.880 --> 27:26.040
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

27:26.040 --> 27:28.600
You're gonna mess up my-- No.

27:28.600 --> 27:31.000
No, no, no!

28:13.520 --> 28:17.600
-  Yola?! Yola?
-  Oh, thank God. Thank God.

28:17.600 --> 28:20.200
Where-- Where's Yola?

28:20.880 --> 28:22.480
Where's Yola?

28:23.600 --> 28:25.640
Uh, what are you doing?

28:27.200 --> 28:29.440
- What?
- I'm so sorry, Max.

28:35.440 --> 28:37.120
- Hey.
- No.

28:38.000 --> 28:40.880
- No.
-  Hey, hey, hey, hey.

28:40.880 --> 28:44.880
- It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

28:46.040 --> 28:49.280
I'm sorry. Look-- Look at me.

28:50.000 --> 28:52.560
- The women escaped.
- What women?

28:52.560 --> 28:55.240
Fort Vannenburg.
Max, if they talk, we are done.

28:55.800 --> 29:00.520
- Okay. Hunting season?
- Huh? Okay.

29:01.200 --> 29:02.800
Go get 'em.

29:03.840 --> 29:06.000
You should have
listened to me.

29:09.160 --> 29:11.800
It's all falling apart
because of you.

29:15.680 --> 29:18.680
Jacob would never
let it get to this.

29:19.960 --> 29:22.720
- I told you.
- You told me?

29:23.640 --> 29:26.600
And how does that help?
Killing that thing? That would help.

29:26.600 --> 29:29.760
She won't stop until
she gets what she wants.

29:29.760 --> 29:31.360
Yeah, and what's that?

29:32.720 --> 29:36.280
- Sienna's baby.
-  Over my dead body.

29:36.280 --> 29:37.320
And Sienna.

29:37.320 --> 29:39.440
You,
you are out of your fucking mind.

29:39.440 --> 29:42.200
No one touches her or the baby.
Do you understand me?

29:42.200 --> 29:46.000
- Oh.
- Hey! Do you understand me?

29:47.320 --> 29:49.120
Yes.

29:51.520 --> 29:52.960
Good.

30:18.560 --> 30:20.160
No.

32:34.280 --> 32:36.080
You know what my father always said,

32:36.080 --> 32:39.080
never trust something that bleeds for
five days straight and doesn't die.

33:00.720 --> 33:03.480
- Go! Get through!
-  Hey, Max.

33:03.480 --> 33:06.320
Hey, Rudy!
Don't miss the fun, brother.

33:06.320 --> 33:08.200
- Whoo-hoo!
-  Come on, man!

33:08.200 --> 33:11.880
Goddamnit. Jesus!

33:17.480 --> 33:21.480
Auntie Dora, where's Yola?
I know what they did to her.

33:22.240 --> 33:24.960
Oh my God.
What happened? Are you okay?

33:24.960 --> 33:27.720
-  Mamlambo.
- What?

33:28.560 --> 33:32.440
- Where's Yola?
- She's-- She's fine. She's fine.

33:33.360 --> 33:35.080
Where is she?

33:36.240 --> 33:39.360
Come. We'll take you to her.

33:40.000 --> 33:41.640
Come.

33:56.360 --> 33:59.000
Come on. Come on. Come on.

34:06.080 --> 34:08.760
Whoo-hoo!

34:10.120 --> 34:12.720
There, there, there, there, there.
Go on, go on.

34:16.960 --> 34:19.640
Get them!

34:19.640 --> 34:21.800
Whoo-hoo!

34:25.560 --> 34:28.520
Got her right
in the kidney.

34:34.560 --> 34:36.560
-  There's another one.
- Okay, mine, mine, mine.

34:36.560 --> 34:38.400
Go, boys!

34:40.800 --> 34:41.960
- Oh, you're bloody useless.
- Come on!

34:41.960 --> 34:47.320
- Let's go! Run her over. Faster.
- Whoo-hoo-hoo!

35:18.360 --> 35:19.960
Yola?

35:22.840 --> 35:24.440
Yola?

35:28.400 --> 35:30.000
Yola?

37:25.120 --> 37:28.600
Dora, please,
what are you doing?

37:28.600 --> 37:30.640
It's for the highest good.

37:30.640 --> 37:32.400
Dora!

37:34.280 --> 37:36.040
Please!

37:37.960 --> 37:39.760
Dora!

37:43.360 --> 37:46.040
Hold on, hold on.
Help is on the way.

38:00.680 --> 38:02.520
I thought I got rid of you.

38:03.400 --> 38:05.000
It's not that easy.

38:05.720 --> 38:08.440
- I'm back.
- Well, that's a pity.

38:08.440 --> 38:10.200
'Cause you just fucked
everything up for me.

38:10.200 --> 38:12.040
It's always been about you,
isn't it?

38:12.640 --> 38:15.880
- I'm just taking what's mine.
- Haven't you taken enough, Rudy?

38:16.280 --> 38:18.400
You kill everything you touch.

38:18.400 --> 38:21.760
The children, the women,
the animals, this land.

38:21.760 --> 38:25.040
Stop whining. The women
and animals are ours to use.

38:25.040 --> 38:28.640
When you look at these trees
around you. Tell me, what do you see?

38:28.640 --> 38:31.040
I know that one
is in the wrong fucking place.

38:32.400 --> 38:35.680
- You see wood and money?
- Yeah, what do you see?

38:35.680 --> 38:39.240
- I see shade.
- Oh, very holy.

38:39.240 --> 38:41.840
Well, you like the giant snake
that ate everything in his path,

38:41.840 --> 38:43.360
only to swallow his own tail.

38:43.360 --> 38:45.720
Hey,
who the fuck are you to judge me?

38:45.720 --> 38:47.400
I know who you are.

38:47.400 --> 38:50.560
Yeah,
you talk big about freedom and greed,

38:50.560 --> 38:53.480
but all you want
is what I already have.

38:54.360 --> 38:58.720
You are just a slave who dreams
of having a slave of his own.

38:58.720 --> 39:02.240
No, Rudy. Can you not see
that all of this is connected?

39:02.920 --> 39:05.680
The living, the dead.

39:05.680 --> 39:10.360
The soil, the water. Even you
and I are connected, my brother.

39:12.720 --> 39:15.880
Well, in that case,
this is gonna hurt us both.

39:16.680 --> 39:18.280
Rudy?

39:52.680 --> 39:57.640
Rudy!

39:58.560 --> 40:00.360
The fuck are you doing?

40:00.360 --> 40:02.840
Don't you see, Rudy?
It's for the best.

40:02.840 --> 40:04.680
I won't let you do it.

40:06.640 --> 40:10.440
- Ah!

40:15.320 --> 40:17.360
I always knew you were weak.

40:18.240 --> 40:20.080
You never had it in you.

40:20.720 --> 40:22.800
And now look what you've done.

40:23.880 --> 40:28.200
You've ended 200 glorious years

40:28.200 --> 40:31.840
of dominion over this land
and all that lives on it.

40:36.200 --> 40:38.000
And for what?

40:49.600 --> 40:51.200
Sienna.

41:08.520 --> 41:10.320
Oh, great one.

41:12.960 --> 41:15.120
Take our offering.

41:16.520 --> 41:18.640
Balance the scales.

41:20.560 --> 41:22.560
And leave us in peace.

42:15.880 --> 42:18.520
Go away. Go away, go away, go away.

42:37.360 --> 42:39.160
Oh God, no.

42:39.760 --> 42:42.360
- No, no, no. Get...

42:42.360 --> 42:45.520
Please. Please, God, don't kill me.

42:46.640 --> 42:48.720
He's the only one in there.

42:51.080 --> 42:55.560
Please.
Please, no, no, no, no, no. Please.

42:55.560 --> 42:59.360
- Oh God. Please don't...
- Max.

43:04.080 --> 43:06.320
Yola? Oh, God.

43:06.920 --> 43:08.120
- I thought you were the monster.
- Don't.

43:08.120 --> 43:11.400
- We have to go. No, no, we have to--
- Don't touch me.

43:11.400 --> 43:12.880
Hey.

43:12.880 --> 43:15.200
- I'm sorry.
- What are you sorry for, Max?

43:17.160 --> 43:18.760
For leaving you.

43:19.280 --> 43:22.440
But I-- I went for help.
I-- I thought you were dead.

43:23.200 --> 43:24.920
I know what you did.

43:28.680 --> 43:34.280
Yola, you have to understand, okay?
I did it for us.

43:34.920 --> 43:36.920
-  For us?
- Yeah.

43:36.920 --> 43:40.160
- For our people. For our land.
- You nearly destroyed me.

43:41.840 --> 43:44.480
It worked, okay.
You brought the rain.

43:44.480 --> 43:47.040
You shoved your shame
deep inside of me.

43:47.840 --> 43:51.880
I carried it for you.
I'm here to give it back to you, Max.

43:52.360 --> 43:54.280
And then you lied to me.

43:54.280 --> 43:56.240
You looked me in the eyes,
you cried real tears.

43:56.240 --> 43:59.120
You told me such bullshit
and I believed you.

44:01.240 --> 44:03.000
But I'm done.

45:55.560 --> 45:57.600
The bar is closed,
come back at 12:00.

46:00.920 --> 46:03.600
I said, "The bar is closed."

46:08.640 --> 46:10.240
Clara?

47:40.280 --> 47:42.040
What exactly did she say?

47:43.240 --> 47:45.520
She says she likes you very much.

47:49.000 --> 47:50.800
And she's given us her blessing.

47:54.320 --> 47:55.920
Thank you.

48:11.600 --> 48:13.520
I wanna keep the baby.

48:19.720 --> 48:21.480
Did you hear what I said?

48:23.960 --> 48:25.800
I said I wanna have the baby.

48:29.800 --> 48:32.000
I know things need to change, but...

48:34.200 --> 48:35.960
I need you here.

48:37.560 --> 48:40.680
And I need things to be
different than it was for us.

49:16.240 --> 49:17.880
Mm-mm.

49:32.040 --> 49:33.760
- Bye.
-  Bye.

50:48.040 --> 50:50.560
Oh, that's the end of that then.
