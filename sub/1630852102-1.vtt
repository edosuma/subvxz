That night the call came out

that there was a man down
behind the library downtown.

And he said, "Yes."
He said, "I need a drink."

39:07.386 --> 39:09.263
So, we went to the restaurant bar

39:09.347 --> 39:11.390
<i>and we sat there for hours.</i>

39:12.683 --> 39:13.976
(ice clinking)

39:15.978 --> 39:18.689
<i>Tossed a few down, I'll tell you.</i>

39:19.732 --> 39:21.525
<i>So we were getting pretty--</i>

39:21.776 --> 39:23.986
<i>pretty comfortable with each other.</i>

39:27.073 --> 39:30.117
He told me that, you know,
"My daughter's favorite place

39:30.201 --> 39:33.079
"in the world was Anahola Bay in Kauai.

39:34.580 --> 39:37.208
<i>"And I'm going to take her ashes there</i>

39:37.291 --> 39:39.710
<i>"and I'm gonna sprinkle them</i>
<i>on Anahola Bay.</i>

39:40.294 --> 39:42.004
<i>And you're welcome to go."</i>

39:42.838 --> 39:44.590
I said, "Well, that's kind of
above and beyond

39:44.673 --> 39:46.759
"the duty of a homicide detective, Chuck,

39:46.842 --> 39:49.553
but if I-- if I can make it,
I'll make it."

39:50.054 --> 39:51.138
And I did.

39:54.642 --> 39:57.728
<i>I have been told by many,</i>
<i>many homicide detectives,</i>

39:57.812 --> 40:00.689
<i>"Grogan, you get too emotionally involved</i>
<i>with your victims."</i>

40:01.482 --> 40:03.067
<i>I can't change that.</i>

40:03.984 --> 40:06.654
<i>I got very close to the Weckler family</i>

40:06.737 --> 40:09.657
and, uh, you tend to get
emotionally involved

40:09.740 --> 40:12.535
because you're now becoming
like part of the family.

40:16.872 --> 40:20.167
And then Chuck said,
"I want to know everything.

40:20.918 --> 40:23.254
I want to know what they did to her."

40:24.380 --> 40:26.966
And I explained to him, I says,

40:27.049 --> 40:30.010
"Well, Chuck, I can't tell you
everything that happened.

40:30.094 --> 40:32.430
"One, I don't know
everything that happened

40:32.513 --> 40:34.390
"at this point in time.

40:34.473 --> 40:37.393
"And it would be
jeopardizing any procedure,

40:37.476 --> 40:40.187
any trial procedure,
case, if I told you that."

40:40.896 --> 40:43.190
It bothered him. I could see it hurt him.

40:44.233 --> 40:47.653
But that creates an anger in me,

40:49.029 --> 40:50.239
uh...

40:51.574 --> 40:53.325
to find them bastards.

40:53.409 --> 40:55.411
♪♪

41:03.586 --> 41:06.046
(motor revs)

41:07.673 --> 41:10.676

41:13.053 --> 41:14.388
