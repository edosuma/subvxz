In the city's underground,

02:02.166 --> 02:04.558
there's a symphony of sound,

02:04.559 --> 02:09.172
a sonic chaos for the lost
before they're found.

02:09.173 --> 02:11.805
There's a beauty in the sorrow,

02:11.806 --> 02:13.992
a kind of kinship
that we borrow.

02:13.993 --> 02:16.565
For no matter how you hate it,

02:16.566 --> 02:19.139

08:59.365 --> 09:01.541
and thanks you
for your patience.

Now, you know you can't

He locked the door.

09:48.805 --> 09:51.067
Ladies and gentlemen!

09:51.068 --> 09:54.201
It must be apparent that
I'm about to ask for money.

09:54.202 --> 09:57.335
But I will neither regale you
with my tale of woe,

09:57.336 --> 09:59.728

I prefer, sirs, madams,
to earn my wage.

10:07.999 --> 10:10.218

a performance,

10:10.219 --> 10:12.262
for your listening pleasure,

10:12.263 --> 10:16.703
from the work
of Sir William Shakespeare.

10:19.227 --> 10:23.774
To be, or not to be,

10:23.775 --> 10:28.322
that is the question:

10:28.323 --> 10:30.933
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind

10:30.934 --> 10:34.242
to suffer the slings and arrows
of outrageous fortune,

10:34.243 --> 10:39.334
or by taking arms
against a sea of troubles

10:39.335 --> 10:45.967
and by opposing end them.

10:45.968 --> 10:52.601
To die... sleep, no more;

10:52.652 --> 10:56.220
and by a sleep to say we end...

10:56.221 --> 10:58.657
Excuse me.

10:58.658 --> 11:00.790
Could you not do that?

11:03.140 --> 11:05.534
Is it your intention
to deprive these fine people

11:05.535 --> 11:07.623
of their entertainment?

11:11.975 --> 11:13.715
Soft you now?

11:13.716 --> 11:16.240
Twill do, fine sir.

11:19.722 --> 11:23.160
Ah, there's the rub.

11:23.161 --> 11:25.422

11:44.965 --> 11:47.837
We'll probably move
in a minute or something.

11:51.667 --> 11:54.016
I'm an artist, actually.

11:54.017 --> 11:56.759
Sor... Uh, kinda like
an artist/writer, I guess.

11:56.760 --> 12:00.457
Not professional
or anything... yet.

12:00.458 --> 12:05.942
Um, I've been working
on this comic that um...

12:05.943 --> 12:07.464
Uh, see?

12:07.465 --> 12:10.576
It's about a teenaged,
handicapped superhero.

12:10.577 --> 12:12.981
She's risen above
her misfortune to battle...

12:12.982 --> 12:15.386
Look, I don't feel
like talking right now.

12:15.387 --> 12:18.476
Oh. You speak E...

12:18.477 --> 12:20.609
Yeah.

12:24.353 --> 12:26.005
Your, um...

12:26.006 --> 12:30.053

is... is good.

12:30.054 --> 12:31.968

12:31.969 --> 12:33.883
Uh, what?

12:33.884 --> 12:35.797
You a dancer?

12:35.798 --> 12:38.408
No, um, I'm not.

12:38.409 --> 12:41.238
Then why are you
hanging around the studio?

12:41.239 --> 12:43.065
Well, like I said,

12:43.066 --> 12:45.895
I'm an artist, actually,
and I wanna...

12:45.896 --> 12:47.832
Right.
Remember just a second ago,

12:47.833 --> 12:49.769
when I said
I didn't wanna talk?

12:49.770 --> 12:51.248
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

12:51.249 --> 12:52.727
I meant that.

12:52.728 --> 12:54.207
Okay.
Yeah, um...

12:54.208 --> 12:56.405
I don't wanna talk at all,
about anything. Okay?

12:56.406 --> 12:58.603
We could talk about nothing.
Nothing's good.

13:01.846 --> 13:04.250
No thing.

13:06.655 --> 13:08.308
Which is fascinating

13:08.309 --> 13:09.397
if you think about it in the
nihilistic sense, because...

13:09.398 --> 13:12.138
Seriously?!

13:12.139 --> 13:15.011
Do you think when I say,
"I don't wanna talk,"

13:15.012 --> 13:17.709
that I really do
wanna talk to you?

13:17.710 --> 13:20.102
No.
I... I just wan...

13:20.103 --> 13:21.539
I don't see you trying to show
your stupid comic book

13:21.540 --> 13:23.192
to anyone else
on this train.

13:23.193 --> 13:25.194
That's because I... I thought
you would enjoy it, too.

13:25.195 --> 13:27.241
What? Did you think maybe I was
some cute little Asian girl

13:27.242 --> 13:29.025

19:37.742 --> 19:38.785
Oh, my God.

19:38.786 --> 19:40.700
I'm just curious.

19:40.701 --> 19:43.268
You're gonna get curiously
stabbed in the face.

19:43.269 --> 19:45.836
He's not gonna sta...
You're not gonna stab...?

20:10.296 --> 20:11.971
What is wrong with you?
Nothing.

20:11.972 --> 20:13.646

on this train.

20:13.647 --> 20:15.909
You have no business
provoking that guy.

20:15.910 --> 20:18.173
I was just asking him
some simple questions.

20:18.174 --> 20:20.261
No, she's right.

20:20.262 --> 20:22.786
You have no idea how that
kind of a person can react.

20:22.787 --> 20:24.918

look like to you?

22:18.338 --> 22:19.554
What do you mean?

22:19.555 --> 22:22.341
What do I
look like to you?

22:24.995 --> 22:27.998
I don't know how to answer
that question.

22:27.999 --> 22:31.545

22:31.546 --> 22:35.092

22:35.093 --> 22:36.832
Oh, sure you do!

22:36.833 --> 22:40.141
Go on ahead and say it.
What do I look like to you?

22:40.142 --> 22:41.882
Go on, say it!

22:41.883 --> 22:43.883

22:43.884 --> 22:47.583

a homeless person.

23:06.602 --> 23:08.690
And what does he
look like to you?

23:08.691 --> 23:10.127
No, what... what does
he look like to you?!

23:10.128 --> 23:12.346
That's enough.

23:12.347 --> 23:14.088
Oh, no.
No, it's not enough.

23:14.089 --> 23:14.915

23:14.916 --> 23:16.611

Don't you bother
that woman no more.

23:18.398 --> 23:21.660

23:21.661 --> 23:23.031

any points.

23:24.403 --> 23:26.230
Besides, what is
she supposed to say?

23:26.231 --> 23:27.840
If you weren't homeless,

23:27.841 --> 23:29.625

all of that right now.

28:51.034 --> 28:54.254
You're speaking English.
I should've...

28:54.255 --> 28:58.344
My Spanish is...

28:58.345 --> 29:00.956
You might be interested
to know that, um,

29:00.957 --> 29:02.609
the Spanish
that I do know,

29:02.610 --> 29:04.786
I learned from
our janitorial staff...

29:04.787 --> 29:07.833
I mean our,
um, maintenance men.

29:10.183 --> 29:11.618
You're just like them.

29:11.619 --> 29:15.100
I mean, you're not just like
them, but you, um...

29:15.101 --> 29:18.582
Well, I can see you're
a very diligent worker.

29:22.978 --> 29:28.244
Well, I... I just think
you're very fortunate.

29:28.245 --> 29:30.769
It's clear for you
why you work.

29:30.770 --> 29:32.901
I mean, you're lucky.

29:35.643 --> 29:36.862
You know who you are.

29:39.429 --> 29:41.388
Fortunate?

29:50.397 --> 29:54.923
This country wasn't made
for people like me.

29:54.924 --> 29:57.360
It was made
for people like you.

29:57.361 --> 29:59.798
Then why are you here?

30:01.364 --> 30:03.976
Seriously, why?

30:06.152 --> 30:07.456
Maybe because
when it comes down to it,

30:07.457 --> 30:10.721
it's better than anywhere else
in the world.

30:10.722 --> 30:12.244
Better if you're
a rich white man.

30:12.245 --> 30:14.029
- I'm not a rich white man.
- Maybe your papiis.

30:14.030 --> 30:15.464
What makes you
say that?

30:15.465 --> 30:17.250
Your English is too good
for a Chinese girl.

30:17.251 --> 30:19.381
I'm Korean.

30:19.382 --> 30:21.689
I don't have anything
you can't get for yourself.

30:24.300 --> 30:26.694
You've never had to decide
between seeing your family

30:26.695 --> 30:28.913
and feeding your family.

30:28.914 --> 30:31.917
You probably never even had to
pay for your own toilet paper.

30:31.918 --> 30:33.657
Nobody forced you
to have a bunch of kids.

30:33.658 --> 30:35.397
I think
it's incredibly honorable

30:35.398 --> 30:37.836
that he puts the needs
of his family before his own.

30:37.837 --> 30:41.099
Okay.
I get that.

30:41.100 --> 30:43.210
But what if something bad
happened to you?

30:43.211 --> 30:45.320
What if you got hurt?
What would you do?

30:45.321 --> 30:49.021
Go to the hospital, right?
And you'd be treated.

30:49.022 --> 30:50.522
Only, and correct me
if I'm wrong,

30:50.523 --> 30:52.339
you don't have
health insurance,

30:52.340 --> 30:54.155
so you wouldn't
be able to pay.

30:54.156 --> 30:56.593
Well, that's a rather
heartless way of...

30:56.594 --> 30:58.725
Right!
I know.

30:58.726 --> 31:01.249
That's the conundrum,
right?

31:01.250 --> 31:02.948
So what happens is a bunch
of hospitals have to shut down

31:02.949 --> 31:04.774
because of the overwhelming
demand of people

31:04.775 --> 31:06.951
who get sick and hurt and can't
afford to pay their bills.

31:06.952 --> 31:09.868
You think people are just supposed
to be left bleeding in the street?

31:09.869 --> 31:11.520
No.
I didn't say that.

31:11.521 --> 31:13.348
So they're not supposed
to go to no hospital?

31:13.349 --> 31:15.177
There are reasons we have
the laws that we do.

31:15.178 --> 31:17.222
There are reasons
there were slaves.

31:17.223 --> 31:19.072
Illegal immigrants
are not slaves.

31:19.073 --> 31:21.172
They come here
because they want to.

31:21.173 --> 31:22.962
And do the work
nobody else wants to do.

31:22.963 --> 31:24.752
Okay, but if they don't
pay taxes, then...

31:24.753 --> 31:26.100
Wait, wait.

31:26.101 --> 31:28.974
How do you know
he don't pay taxes?

31:28.975 --> 31:30.388
Most of them don't.

31:30.389 --> 31:31.801
"Most of them?"

31:31.802 --> 31:33.760
See what I'm saying?
Racist.

31:33.761 --> 31:36.459
I don't mean Hispanics.
I mean illegal immigrants.

31:36.460 --> 31:39.158
"I don't mean to be racist,
I mean to be racist."

31:39.159 --> 31:40.985
No, no, no.
You're twisting my words.

31:40.986 --> 31:42.813
Girl, I got you.
You've been tagged.

31:42.814 --> 31:43.858
- Okay, listen to...
- Tag!

31:43.859 --> 31:45.229
- Most...

31:45.230 --> 31:47.133

31:47.134 --> 31:49.036

- Tag!

31:49.037 --> 31:51.256
Can I finish my sentence,
please?

31:51.257 --> 31:53.454
Yeah, you can finish
your racist sentence. Go ahead.

31:53.455 --> 31:55.652
Okay, first of all,
I'm not the one who's racist.

31:55.653 --> 31:58.219
We're not all Chinese!

31:58.220 --> 32:00.069
And most illegal immigrants
don't pay taxes

32:00.070 --> 32:01.920
because they have to get
paid under the table.

32:01.921 --> 32:03.398
That's a fact.
Doesn't matter

32:03.399 --> 32:05.097
if they're Mexican,
Bengali, Indian...

32:05.098 --> 32:06.749
Damn!
Do you hear yourself?

32:06.750 --> 32:08.448
Which means they enjoy
the benefits of our society

32:08.449 --> 32:10.080
without contributing,
which hurts everyone!

32:10.081 --> 32:11.712
If he wants to live
in America, then he...

32:11.713 --> 32:13.452
You wouldn't even be here

32:13.453 --> 32:15.803
if your mommy and daddy
could make their own kids.

32:18.371 --> 32:22.592
Wow. You got
a bad case of rude.

32:22.593 --> 32:24.463
Oh, yeah?

32:24.464 --> 32:26.182
You people got your shit
50 years ago

32:26.183 --> 32:27.902
and still don't
have it together.

32:27.903 --> 32:29.577
Excuse me?
"You people"?

32:29.578 --> 32:31.252
You had
a black president

32:31.253 --> 32:32.907
and still kill each other
like it's your job.

32:32.908 --> 32:33.994
Which is good,

32:33.995 --> 32:35.170
'cause you usually
don't have one.

32:35.171 --> 32:36.758
So I defend
your sorry ass,

32:36.759 --> 32:38.346
and that's what
you got to say?

32:38.347 --> 32:39.914
You only opened your mouth
'cause black people

32:39.915 --> 32:41.828
love to call racism
any time they can.

32:41.829 --> 32:44.635
I call it when ignorant people
put it in my face.

32:44.636 --> 32:47.443
Well, maybe if you weren't
so ignorant as a people.

32:47.444 --> 32:49.531
Okay.

32:49.532 --> 32:52.187
I'm gonna need you to watch
your tone, Speedy Gonzales.

32:52.188 --> 32:54.145
What the hell are you
doin' all day?

32:54.146 --> 32:56.931
Standin' in the street,
fumandomarijuana,

32:56.932 --> 32:58.432
blarin' shit
from your stereo.

32:58.433 --> 32:59.933
mamita.

32:59.934 --> 33:02.501
Life ain't your ride
and your weave.

33:02.502 --> 33:04.895
I think this is a totally
inappropriate conversation!

33:04.896 --> 33:06.157
You better
watch your mouth

33:06.158 --> 33:07.855
before I yank your tongue
out your head.

33:07.856 --> 33:09.116
You ain't gonna do shit.

33:09.117 --> 33:10.292
Everybody knows
you people are all talk.

33:10.293 --> 33:11.946
Let me show you
how I talk.

33:11.947 --> 33:13.599
No, no, wait a minute!
Wait.

33:13.600 --> 33:16.298
We're all trapped
on the train together.

33:22.043 --> 33:24.132
Taco. I should punch you
in your face.

33:37.102 --> 33:39.626
Quite right, my lady.

33:39.627 --> 33:40.844
Quite right.

33:46.154 --> 33:49.375
Hey. How much did you give
that guy, anyway?

33:49.376 --> 33:52.942
$20.

33:52.943 --> 33:55.467
Takes me three hours
to make that.

33:55.468 --> 33:57.687
I can give you some, too,
if... if you want...

33:57.688 --> 33:59.427
No, no, no, no, no.

33:59.428 --> 34:02.126
I work for my money,
mijo.

34:02.127 --> 34:06.914
I work honestly for my wage,
as well, sir.

34:06.915 --> 34:09.482
Oh, yeah?
Haciendo que?

34:09.483 --> 34:12.527
By doing what?

34:12.527 --> 34:13.833
Sleepin' in the train?

34:13.833 --> 34:15.139
Lyin' in the gutter?

34:15.139 --> 34:16.663
Who you servin'
doing that?

34:16.664 --> 34:18.272
You? Me? Them?

34:18.273 --> 34:22.407
I bring a measure of grace
to the world.

34:22.408 --> 34:25.280
You know what I don't get?

34:25.281 --> 34:30.024
Me? I will do anything
to feed my kids,

34:30.025 --> 34:32.156
anything por mi familia.

34:32.157 --> 34:35.550
And you? There is
nothing wrong with you.

34:35.551 --> 34:37.987
Nothing, except that you
won't get up off that bench

34:37.989 --> 34:40.730
to help yourself
or anyone else.

34:42.949 --> 34:46.561
Thou, nature,
art my goddess.

34:46.562 --> 34:48.563
To thy laws
my services are bound.

34:48.563 --> 34:51.065
Wherefore should I stand
in the plague of custom

34:51.067 --> 34:53.569
and let the curiosity
of nations deprive me?

34:53.570 --> 34:56.572
When my dimensions
are as well compact,

34:56.572 --> 34:58.399
my mind generous...

34:58.400 --> 35:00.098
...my shape as true...

35:00.099 --> 35:02.187
...as honest...

35:02.188 --> 35:03.775
as honest madam's issue...

35:08.150 --> 35:09.542

to your problem.

40:02.705 --> 40:03.923
What?

40:04.010 --> 40:07.187
LloyI may have a solutionution

40:53.755 --> 40:56.192
Can you just stand in front

40:56.193 --> 40:59.326
- Oh, sure.
- Thanks.

41:12.121 --> 41:15.863
Oh, I-I have my jacket.

41:15.864 --> 41:17.431
No one wants to see
your little titi.

41:17.432 --> 41:19.084
Just get it done.

41:19.085 --> 41:22.675
All right, Creepy Time.
Go 'head up there.

41:22.676 --> 41:26.266
And keep your hands
where I can see 'em.

41:34.796 --> 41:37.233
Can somebody talk
or something?

41:37.234 --> 41:39.278

Shakespeare?

Keep going!

42:53.571 --> 42:55.573
Thank you, my lady.

43:08.803 --> 43:10.588
What do you think
he's gonna do with that?

43:10.589 --> 43:11.806
You can never
be quite sure.

43:40.095 --> 43:41.574
I can't do that.

43:41.575 --> 43:43.664
You just hold it,
you just use one finger.

43:43.665 --> 43:46.188
Dee, dee-dee, dee.
With a nail.

43:46.189 --> 43:49.887
I'm not a techie.

43:54.414 --> 43:57.525
Are you all right?

43:57.526 --> 44:00.637
Yeah.
I'm okay.

44:00.638 --> 44:02.291
I'm about to ask
that fool over there

44:02.292 --> 44:04.163
for another bottle,
though.

44:14.869 --> 44:17.175
Would you like
a protein bar?

44:17.176 --> 44:20.092
These are the good ones.
They don't taste like dirt.

44:20.093 --> 44:22.572
No, thank you.

44:22.573 --> 44:25.052
Well, I have two.

44:25.053 --> 44:27.141
Why are you trying
to feed me?

44:27.142 --> 44:31.407
I-I just think that you need
some food, you know...

44:31.408 --> 44:33.409
because of the baby.

44:33.410 --> 44:36.760
What?

44:36.761 --> 44:38.544
I look pregnant to you?

44:38.545 --> 44:41.983
Oh, no.
I don't mean... No.

44:44.333 --> 44:46.596
It's just, I can tell.

44:46.597 --> 44:48.859
And how can you tell?

44:48.860 --> 44:51.296
And don't give me that,
"Oh, you have a glow.

44:51.297 --> 44:54.866
I can see it all over your face"
white-woman bullshit, either.

44:58.217 --> 45:00.872
I don't have
another explanation.

45:03.135 --> 45:05.136
Well,
that's kind of creepy.

45:05.137 --> 45:07.139
'Cause my mama
didn't even know.

45:07.140 --> 45:08.444

Yeah.

45:14.059 --> 45:16.256

49:19.173 --> 49:22.284
But I bet you have some family

49:22.285 --> 49:25.397
that can help you out
when the baby comes.

49:25.398 --> 49:29.792
There ain't
gonna be no baby.

49:29.793 --> 49:31.816

Well, of course, you should
do what you need to do.

49:51.292 --> 49:56.863
I know I shouldn't,
but I just see this!

49:56.864 --> 49:58.995
This could be...

49:58.996 --> 50:01.432
This could just be
a gift from God.

50:01.433 --> 50:04.043
I-I don't know,
like an opportunity.

50:04.044 --> 50:06.655
So you're one of those?

50:06.656 --> 50:08.983
One of whom?

50:08.984 --> 50:11.311
Look, lady.

50:11.312 --> 50:13.271
God ain't gonna be the one
elbow-deep in messy diapers,

50:13.272 --> 50:14.749
running from
school to work,

50:14.750 --> 50:16.013
tryin' to deal with
a dumb-ass baby daddy.

50:16.014 --> 50:18.167
I wasn't
criticizing you, I...

50:18.168 --> 50:20.320
Anyone can chalk
their life

50:20.321 --> 50:21.669
up to doing what
God wants them to do,

50:21.670 --> 50:25.109
and not take responsibility
for it themselves.

50:25.110 --> 50:27.111
You tell me
what's worse...

50:27.112 --> 50:28.569
Havin' it when
you ain't ready,

50:28.570 --> 50:30.843
or taking care
of the problem

50:30.844 --> 50:33.116
before it ruins
everyone's lives?

50:33.117 --> 50:34.857
Well, it can be
incredibly challenging

50:34.858 --> 50:35.815
raising a child,
I know.

50:35.816 --> 50:37.424
This ain't a child!

50:37.425 --> 50:39.339
It can't survive
without me!

50:39.340 --> 50:44.128
That's not a human being,
that's a parasite!

50:44.129 --> 50:46.304
And this ain't
none of your business.

50:51.787 --> 50:53.311
I know.
I'm sorry.

50:57.141 --> 51:00.318
I'm just a little...
I, um...

51:00.319 --> 51:01.841
My son, he...

51:04.670 --> 51:07.847
I lost my son.

51:10.328 --> 51:13.286
He was, um...

51:13.287 --> 51:16.290
Well, actually,
somewhat recently.

51:18.510 --> 51:21.295
Was a year ago...

51:21.296 --> 51:23.514
today.

51:23.515 --> 51:26.170
Well, there went
that opportunity from God.

51:34.178 --> 51:37.920
You don't know
anything about me.

51:40.314 --> 51:43.491
About my life,
about my son.

51:47.408 --> 51:49.410
You're right. I don't
know anything about you.

52:06.775 --> 52:08.995

57:14.693 --> 57:15.909
Gracias.

57:15.910 --> 57:21.481
Um, I'm truly, truly sorry
about your son,

57:21.482 --> 57:24.266
but this ain't
the same thing.

57:24.267 --> 57:27.704
I'm alone.
All alone.

57:27.705 --> 57:31.056
I was alone,
just like you.

57:34.320 --> 57:39.106
You were never,
ever just like me.

57:39.107 --> 57:42.546
I'm guessing you believe
every pregnancy is God's will?

57:42.547 --> 57:43.590
No.

57:47.594 --> 57:51.468
I just believe
some women are mothers.

57:51.469 --> 57:52.685
Yeah, well, I'm not.

57:52.686 --> 57:55.297
- I disagree.
- You don't even know me.

57:55.298 --> 57:57.495
It doesn't make
any difference.

57:57.496 --> 57:59.693
You'd make
a fantastic mother.

58:01.521 --> 58:03.479
How could you
be so sure?

58:03.480 --> 58:07.048
Just some
"white-woman bullshit."

58:12.097 --> 58:13.794
Maybe she'd
actually be doing a service

58:13.795 --> 58:16.493
by saving some kid
from a life of misery.

58:20.366 --> 58:24.065
I didn't mean that a kid would be
miserable with you specifically.

58:24.066 --> 58:26.763
I-I just...

58:26.764 --> 58:29.243
I just meant
it's hard, you know,

58:29.244 --> 58:33.553
for... for anyone to feel
connected to anybody else.

58:33.554 --> 58:36.295
It's all pretty pathetic.

58:36.296 --> 58:39.036
I mean
who in this city...

58:39.037 --> 58:43.323
actually, who... who
in the world ever just tries...

58:43.324 --> 58:47.611
Between texting, e-mails,
FaceTime, Skype, whatever,

58:47.612 --> 58:49.133
we have more ways
of communicating now

58:49.134 --> 58:52.528
than we ever have before,
and... and yet we just use them

58:52.529 --> 58:55.923
as new and more convenient
methods of ignoring each other.

58:55.924 --> 58:57.881
Wow.

58:57.882 --> 59:00.667
Deep thoughts from
Creepy Time Subway Stalker.

59:04.715 --> 59:08.108
You know, it's weird
how you think

59:08.109 --> 59:11.548
that you can say anything
you want to anyone you want.

59:11.549 --> 59:13.418
I don't think that.
No?

59:13.419 --> 59:15.639
What about all that smack you
were talking to him earlier?

59:15.640 --> 59:19.077
"Smack"?
I wasn't talking smack.

59:19.078 --> 59:20.121
It was just a debate.

59:20.122 --> 59:22.166
Oh. Right.

59:22.167 --> 59:24.299
So it's totally okay for someone
like you to have a debate,

59:24.300 --> 59:26.976
but you feel fine telling me
when I need to shut up?

59:26.977 --> 59:29.653
- I didn't tell you to shut up.
- Yeah, you did.

59:29.654 --> 59:31.132
Seriously,
what... what is the deal?

59:31.133 --> 59:33.090
Is someone just

59:33.091 --> 59:35.593
handing out entitlement cards
to girls like you

59:35.594 --> 59:38.096
that just give you
the go-ahead to act like a...

59:38.097 --> 59:41.620
Bitch?

59:41.621 --> 59:46.844
I didn't say that,
but, okay, yeah.

59:46.845 --> 59:48.323
Whatever.

59:52.197 --> 59:53.632
What's that like?

59:53.633 --> 59:55.068
What's whatlike?

59:55.069 --> 59:57.244
Being entitled
to pick and choose

59:57.245 --> 59:59.770
the guys allowed to look at you
or speak to you.

59:59.771 --> 01:00:01.989
I don't get to pick
and choose that stuff,

01:00:01.990 --> 01:00:03.207
'cause if I did,

01:00:03.208 --> 01:00:05.122
you wouldn't be talking to me
right now.

01:00:05.123 --> 01:00:06.819
See?! That's what
I'm talking about.

01:00:06.820 --> 01:00:08.756
Th-That's exactly
what I'm saying.

01:00:08.757 --> 01:00:10.443
You assume that
you're entitled

01:00:10.444 --> 01:00:12.129
to just say
whatever you want

01:00:12.130 --> 01:00:16.830
because, well, after all,
you're just so fucking pretty!

01:00:21.835 --> 01:00:26.273
It's so twisted
that after stalking me,

01:00:26.274 --> 01:00:27.753
you're actually trying
to turn this shit around

01:00:27.754 --> 01:00:29.234
and make make it my fault
that you're a freak.

01:00:29.235 --> 01:00:30.779
I'm not stalking you.
Two days in a row,

01:00:30.780 --> 01:00:32.324
you were sitting outside
the coffee shop,

01:00:32.325 --> 01:00:33.521
waiting for me
as I left.

01:00:33.522 --> 01:00:34.717
I like
the coffee there.

01:00:34.718 --> 01:00:36.762
And today is, what,
a coincidence

01:00:36.763 --> 01:00:38.699
that you were sitting outside
the studio,

01:00:38.700 --> 01:00:40.637
got on the same subway,
the same car?

01:00:40.638 --> 01:00:42.399
Wow.
You know my every move.

01:00:42.400 --> 01:00:44.161
Maybe you're
stalking me.

01:00:44.162 --> 01:00:46.011
What is it that you thought
was gonna happen, huh?

01:00:46.012 --> 01:00:47.861
Did you think we were gonna
go on a date or something?

01:00:47.862 --> 01:00:49.340
No.

01:00:49.341 --> 01:00:52.257
Do you wanna sneak a few more
shots of me on your cell?

01:00:52.258 --> 01:00:53.867
No, no, no. Don't look down.

01:00:53.868 --> 01:00:55.651
I mean,
we're stuck here, right?

01:00:55.652 --> 01:00:57.436
Let's just
get it over with.
