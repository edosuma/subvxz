02:12.490 --> 02:13.800
Dr. Cotter.

02:13.800 --> 02:15.490
 He’s gonna die.
She’s gonna die.

02:15.490 --> 02:17.490
Mom’s gonna die.
 I’m gonna die.
 Everybody dies.

02:17.490 --> 02:19.830
I don’t wanna--
I’m gonna--

02:21.100 --> 02:23.200
I haven’t been able
to get him to talk...

02:23.200 --> 02:24.660
respond to me,
nothing.

02:26.270 --> 02:27.670
Just this.

02:27.670 --> 02:29.840
Yeah.
I got it.

02:30.670 --> 02:31.980
Thanks, Dan.

02:31.980 --> 02:33.470
She’s gonna die.
Mom’s gonna die.

02:33.470 --> 02:34.980
I’m gonna die.
Everyone dies.

02:34.980 --> 02:37.020
Nobody matters.
She doesn’t matter.

02:37.020 --> 02:39.050
He doesn’t matter.
She doesn’t matter.
Mom doesn’t matter.

02:39.050 --> 02:40.890
I don’t matter.
Nothing ever matters.

02:40.890 --> 02:43.790
I don’t matter.
I don’t matter.
I don’t matter.

02:43.790 --> 02:45.450
 He’s gonna die.
She’s gonna die.

02:45.450 --> 02:47.690
He’s gonna die.
I’m gonna die.
Everyone dies.

02:47.690 --> 02:49.520
Nobody matters.
She doesn’t matter.

02:49.520 --> 02:51.560
He doesn’t matter.
She doesn’t matter.
Everyone dies.

02:51.560 --> 02:53.000
I’m gonna die.
Nobody matters.

02:53.000 --> 02:55.000
She doesn’t matter.
He doesn’t matter.

02:55.000 --> 02:56.700
Mom doesn’t matter.
Nothing ever matters.

02:56.700 --> 02:58.470
I don’t matter.
I don’t ma--

02:58.470 --> 03:01.170
I’m gonna-- I’m gonna--
I’m gonna-- I’m gonna--

03:01.170 --> 03:04.210
She’s gonna-- She’s gonna--
Everyone-- I’m gonna--

03:04.210 --> 03:06.510
I don’t matter.
I’m gonna-- I’m gonna--

03:12.350 --> 03:13.610
Hi, Carl.

03:15.710 --> 03:17.290
What’s going on today?

03:19.360 --> 03:20.900
I’m dying.

03:20.900 --> 03:22.090
No.

03:23.190 --> 03:24.620
I don’t think so.

03:27.560 --> 03:29.600
 I think you’re having
another manic episode.

03:29.600 --> 03:30.810
Don’t--

03:31.400 --> 03:32.810
Don’t you tell me.

03:33.440 --> 03:35.270
You don’t know.

03:35.270 --> 03:39.140
I feel it all around me,
squeezing.

03:43.710 --> 03:45.550
I’m scared.

03:45.550 --> 03:51.160
Carl, I know that
what you’re experiencing
feels real,

03:51.160 --> 03:53.360
but it can’t hurt you.

03:57.900 --> 03:59.230
I promise.

03:59.230 --> 04:01.460
 He’s gonna die.
She’s gonna die.

04:01.460 --> 04:03.470
Mom’s gonna die.
I’m gonna die.

04:03.470 --> 04:05.910
Everyone dies.
Nobody matters.

04:05.910 --> 04:10.110
Hey, Wanda.
I’m gonna put Carl Renken
into observation for a few days.

04:10.110 --> 04:12.110
He’s harmless.
Just make sure
someone checks on him

04:12.110 --> 04:13.310
every couple hours.

04:13.310 --> 04:14.920
You got it.
  Thanks.

04:14.920 --> 04:17.220
Hey, Dr. Desai
was looking for you.

04:18.250 --> 04:19.149
Thank you.

04:31.230 --> 04:33.500
No! No! Please!

04:33.500 --> 04:36.630
Please! You don’t understand!
I can’t go in there! No!

04:36.630 --> 04:40.040
No! No! Please!

04:40.540 --> 04:41.910
No!

04:42.770 --> 04:44.340
No!

05:01.190 --> 05:02.390
Come in.

05:03.860 --> 05:07.600
Hey, did you send
a patient named, uh,

05:07.600 --> 05:10.200
Sarah Marquet
over to residency yesterday?

05:10.200 --> 05:13.170
Yes. She has a history
with drug abuse and mania,

05:13.170 --> 05:15.870
and she’s been in and out
of our unit a few times.

05:15.870 --> 05:17.540
Rose,
she has no insurance.

05:17.540 --> 05:19.150
Okay,
but she needs treatment.

05:19.150 --> 05:21.310
The board is down my throat
about paying out of pocket

05:21.310 --> 05:23.120
for another bed
in the residency program.

05:23.120 --> 05:24.990
Maybe the board should try
giving a shit

05:24.990 --> 05:27.710
 about the point
 of our job here
once in a while.

05:29.780 --> 05:31.260
I’m not questioning
your judgment.

05:31.260 --> 05:32.790
I just need you to
come to me first

05:32.790 --> 05:34.360
so I can
get ahead of it next time.
All right?

05:34.360 --> 05:35.820
Yes.

05:35.820 --> 05:37.890
Okay. I’m sorry.

05:37.890 --> 05:40.890
Hey, you haven’t been here
since the late shift
last night, have you?

06:16.040 --> 06:17.470
Dr. Cotter.

06:17.470 --> 06:19.570
Laura Weaver, 26.
She’s a grad student.

06:19.570 --> 06:21.740
Police were called on her
for public disturbance.

06:21.740 --> 06:23.770
EMS brought her in.
Got any psych history?

06:23.770 --> 06:25.870
Nothing on file,
but the police
sent over a report

06:25.870 --> 06:28.250
for a different incident
she was involved in
last week.

06:28.250 --> 06:30.220
And what was that one about?

06:30.220 --> 06:33.380
A professor at her school
bludgeoned himself to death
with a hammer.

06:33.380 --> 06:35.580
 She was interviewed
as the only witness.

06:35.580 --> 06:37.030
A hammer?

06:47.070 --> 06:48.300
Hi.

06:48.890 --> 06:50.070
Laura?

06:53.400 --> 06:56.800
My name is Dr. Cotter.
I’m a therapist.

06:56.800 --> 06:58.310
Do you wanna sit down?

07:00.910 --> 07:02.680
Okay.

07:04.710 --> 07:06.190
I know you’re nervous.

07:06.650 --> 07:08.020
That’s okay.

07:09.120 --> 07:11.090
I just wanna have a chat.

07:11.090 --> 07:13.360
I promise
this is a safe place.

07:14.460 --> 07:15.890
Not for me.

07:17.460 --> 07:19.100
Why do you say that?

07:24.700 --> 07:26.870
Come on. Let’s sit.

07:35.450 --> 07:36.480
Please.

07:52.930 --> 07:57.370
Okay. I’m gonna have to ask you
a couple of questions
that might sound stupid.

08:00.670 --> 08:02.770
What day of the week is it?

08:03.570 --> 08:04.740
Thursday.

08:05.670 --> 08:06.870
And the month?

08:06.870 --> 08:08.640
October.
I’m not crazy.

08:08.640 --> 08:11.220
Nobody’s saying that.
But I need you to understand.

08:11.220 --> 08:14.350
I’m a PhD candidate.
I’m not some lunatic.
Okay?

08:14.350 --> 08:16.450
Let’s just take a breath,

08:16.450 --> 08:19.360
and you can just
tell me what’s going on.

08:29.530 --> 08:31.300
I’m seeing something.

08:33.059 --> 08:35.970
Something no one else
can see except for me.

08:38.179 --> 08:40.380
I know how insane that sounds.
I do.

08:40.380 --> 08:43.909
But it’s--
This thing,
I can’t explain it.

08:45.380 --> 08:46.910
What is it you’re seeing?

08:47.880 --> 08:49.850
It looks like people,

08:49.850 --> 08:51.650
but it’s--
it’s not a person.

08:52.950 --> 08:54.760
I’m not sure I understand.

08:54.760 --> 08:57.200
It looks like people.
It looks like different people.

08:57.200 --> 08:59.860
Sometimes it pretends
to be someone that I know.

08:59.860 --> 09:02.630
Sometimes it’s
a random stranger.
Sometimes--

09:02.630 --> 09:05.340
Sometimes it looks like
my grandfather

09:05.340 --> 09:07.770
who died in front of me
when I was seven.

09:10.340 --> 09:12.680
But it’s all the same thing.
It--

09:14.710 --> 09:17.010
It’s-- It’s like--

09:18.910 --> 09:22.690
It’s-- It’s like it wears
people’s faces like--
like masks.

09:23.920 --> 09:25.520
Okay.

09:25.520 --> 09:27.690
Do you see it right now, here?

09:31.460 --> 09:33.660
What happens
when you do see it?

09:37.300 --> 09:39.100
It’s smiling at me.

09:40.440 --> 09:42.070
But not a friendly smile.

09:42.070 --> 09:43.970
It’s the worst smile
I’ve ever seen in my life.

09:43.970 --> 09:46.350
And whenever I see it,
I just get this

09:46.350 --> 09:50.680
god-awful feeling
like something really terrible
is gonna happen.

09:51.850 --> 09:54.680
I’ve never felt scared
like I do when I see it.

09:56.360 --> 09:59.080
Laura, have you
or anyone else in your family

09:59.080 --> 10:01.460
ever experienced
hallucinations?

10:01.460 --> 10:03.460
It’s not a hallucination, no.
It’s real.

10:03.460 --> 10:05.600
You don’t get it.
It does things to me.

10:05.600 --> 10:07.660
It causes shit
to happen around me.

10:07.660 --> 10:11.400
It’s taken over my whole life
and my mind and...

10:12.930 --> 10:14.370
it tells me things.

10:15.540 --> 10:18.970
It told me that to--
  today--
  Today’s the--

10:18.970 --> 10:22.510
Today’s the day that I’m--
I’m gonna--

10:22.510 --> 10:24.180
Okay. That’s okay.

10:24.180 --> 10:25.420
That’s okay.

10:27.180 --> 10:32.330
I know that
what you’re experiencing
feels incredibly real.

10:32.330 --> 10:35.300
Sometimes, when we get
emotionally overwhelmed,

10:35.300 --> 10:38.960
or experience an intense trauma,
our minds tend to--

10:38.960 --> 10:40.470
You’re not listening to me.

10:40.990 --> 10:42.270
Oh, my God.

10:43.600 --> 10:46.840
I’m gonna fucking die,
and no one will listen to me.

10:46.840 --> 10:48.340
Okay. Laura, it’s okay.

10:48.970 --> 10:50.740
Oh, God.

10:51.350 --> 10:53.510
Hey, it’s okay. Laura.

10:53.510 --> 10:55.680
Hey, c-can you look at me,
please?

10:57.040 --> 10:58.210
It’s okay.

10:59.350 --> 11:00.390
Look at me.

11:02.620 --> 11:03.720
I--

11:07.300 --> 11:09.330
Oh, my God. No!

11:09.330 --> 11:10.690
No! It’s here!

11:10.690 --> 11:12.120
Please!
Laura. It’s okay.

11:12.120 --> 11:13.330
It’s just us.
Get away! Please!

11:13.330 --> 11:14.670
There’s nobody else here.
No!

11:17.340 --> 11:18.770
No!

11:25.350 --> 11:26.740
Oh, my God.

11:29.320 --> 11:31.480
I-- I have
a patient emergency
in eval 2.

11:31.480 --> 11:33.390
I need staff here now.

11:33.390 --> 11:34.520
Hurry.

11:55.410 --> 11:56.610
Laura?

14:12.940 --> 14:15.240
Had Ms. Weaver
ever been a patient here before?

14:15.240 --> 14:19.380
No.
Would you say she was typical
of the patients you see here?

14:19.380 --> 14:22.520
This is an emergency
psychiatric unit.

14:23.520 --> 14:25.660
Typical is not really
a thing here.

14:25.660 --> 14:27.760
Right. But she was
a head case, yeah?

14:27.760 --> 14:29.990
I’m sorry, a head case?

14:34.000 --> 14:36.060
I think we’re just
trying to get
your opinion

14:36.060 --> 14:38.100
of her mental state.

14:39.510 --> 14:41.840
She could’ve been
suffering from

14:42.740 --> 14:44.840
acute post-trauma psychosis.

14:47.240 --> 14:49.950
She was having
paranoid delusions.

14:49.950 --> 14:51.780
What kind of delusions?

14:51.780 --> 14:53.980
She was convinced that some

14:55.220 --> 14:57.950
sort of evil presence
was haunting her.

14:58.860 --> 15:00.060
Yikes.

15:02.090 --> 15:04.730
It’s just, we’re gonna
have to contact
Ms. Weaver’s family

15:04.730 --> 15:06.800
and attempt to explain
what happened.

15:06.800 --> 15:10.770
So we’re looking for
anything that might make
some sense of all this.

15:10.770 --> 15:14.810
If there’s anything else
you can tell us that--
that might help.

15:23.780 --> 15:28.020
Uh, before she died...

15:30.120 --> 15:33.530
she was... smiling.

15:34.450 --> 15:37.190
Yeah, she sounds
fucking crazy to me.

18:17.380 --> 18:18.650
Rose.

18:20.120 --> 18:21.220
Whoa.

18:23.160 --> 18:25.620
My bad. Did I scare you?

18:25.620 --> 18:27.460
I didn’t hear you come in.
Shit.

18:28.130 --> 18:29.300
               Hi.
Hi.

18:29.300 --> 18:30.430
Hi.

18:32.140 --> 18:33.370
What’s up?

18:33.940 --> 18:35.740
Nothing. Sorry.

18:37.140 --> 18:38.470
Something’s wrong.

18:41.850 --> 18:43.670
A patient died today.

18:43.670 --> 18:45.310
My patient.

18:45.310 --> 18:46.850
Oh.

18:46.850 --> 18:48.420
Hey, come here.

18:49.350 --> 18:50.730
I’m sorry.

18:52.020 --> 18:54.030
It happened
right in front of me.

18:54.650 --> 18:55.960
It was awful.

18:57.360 --> 18:59.100
 I’m so sorry.
What can I do?

19:03.000 --> 19:04.630
This is a nice start.

19:09.270 --> 19:13.340
Maybe we should
bail on dinner tonight.

19:16.310 --> 19:18.280
We can’t.

19:19.080 --> 19:21.860
Holly hired a sitter,

19:21.860 --> 19:24.860
and it’s just gonna be
a bigger headache
if we don’t go.

19:24.860 --> 19:27.120
No way.
Holly turning into
a headache?

19:29.520 --> 19:30.690
Hey.

19:41.910 --> 19:44.240
I’m sorry, you wanna
talk about being tired?

19:44.240 --> 19:45.880
Now that Jackson’s
in the first grade,

19:45.880 --> 19:48.670
I’m literally up
at 6:00 a.m. every day

19:48.670 --> 19:51.020
to make him breakfast
and pack him lunch.

19:51.020 --> 19:54.860
God knows what kind of
nonorganic garbage
that cafeteria is even serving.

19:54.860 --> 19:56.350
Then I have to drive him
to school,

19:56.350 --> 19:58.420
barely have any time
to run my own errands.

19:58.420 --> 20:01.550
Like, I haven’t been
to Pilates in weeks.
Okay, my body is so fucked.

20:01.550 --> 20:03.860
Not true.
I have to go back to school,
pick him up,

20:03.860 --> 20:07.560
then I have to take him
to either soccer practice,
swim lessons, karate, theater--

20:07.560 --> 20:09.600
Oh, and he just started
taking Spanish.

20:09.600 --> 20:12.910
I mean, my weekdays
are literally impossible.

20:15.010 --> 20:17.340
Mmm. You are coming
Saturday, right?

20:18.410 --> 20:19.540
What?

20:20.380 --> 20:22.610
Uh, sorry,
what’s Saturday?

20:22.610 --> 20:24.580
           I’m sorry,
           is that a joke?
Wow.

20:24.580 --> 20:26.890
   Rose, Jackson’s
   seventh birthday party.
Wow.

20:26.890 --> 20:28.780
I’ve told you, like,
five times.

20:28.780 --> 20:30.190
I can’t. I have work.

20:31.190 --> 20:33.060
What do you mean work?
It’s Saturday.

20:33.060 --> 20:34.130
I work Saturday.

20:34.130 --> 20:35.750
See, this is exactly why

20:35.750 --> 20:37.260
you have to
get out of that gross hospital

20:37.260 --> 20:39.260
and into a private practice...
Gross?

20:39.260 --> 20:41.460
               It is not gross.
...working normal-people hours.

20:41.460 --> 20:44.370
Rose, there have to be
plenty of crazies out there

20:44.370 --> 20:46.170
who will actually
pay you for your time.

20:46.170 --> 20:48.770
Thank you so much
for your input, Greg.

20:48.770 --> 20:50.110
That’s very sweet.

20:50.110 --> 20:51.880
I’m just saying,
why become a doctor

20:51.880 --> 20:53.980
if you can’t get
disgustingly rich?

20:53.980 --> 20:55.110
You’re kidding, right?

20:56.380 --> 20:58.250
Rose loves being a doctor.
She’d do it for free.

20:58.250 --> 21:00.350
What...

21:02.120 --> 21:04.450
Well, on the subject
of wasted earning potentials,

21:04.450 --> 21:07.090
 we could always
 sell the fucking house.
Can we not right now?

21:07.090 --> 21:09.130
 I don’t understand you.
It’s just sitting there.

21:09.130 --> 21:11.230
We grew up in that house.

21:11.230 --> 21:14.000
Rose, it’s a total teardown.
       Why not just
get the money for the land?

21:14.000 --> 21:15.870
Can you guys just
shut the fuck up?

21:17.270 --> 21:18.370
Wow.

21:20.040 --> 21:21.340
Thank you.

21:21.340 --> 21:22.830
Thank you so much.
Sure.

21:24.840 --> 21:26.740
I’ve been
looking forward to this.

21:59.800 --> 22:00.950
You okay?

22:01.440 --> 22:02.540
Yeah.

22:20.330 --> 22:21.600
Morning, Doc.

22:24.800 --> 22:26.040
Morning.

22:35.150 --> 22:38.120
Hey. Yesterday,
that patient, Laura Weaver--

22:38.120 --> 22:42.090
The police had sent a report
about a different incident
that she was involved in.

22:42.090 --> 22:43.520
Can you get that
forwarded to me?

22:43.520 --> 22:45.090
You got it, Doc.

22:45.090 --> 22:47.560
Also, I was supposed to have
a session with Jane Park.

22:47.560 --> 22:51.530
Oh, yeah. She pulled out
a bunch of her hair overnight
and swallowed it all.

22:51.530 --> 22:54.100
They took her down to medicine
to have her stomach pumped.

22:54.100 --> 22:56.330
              Shit.

22:57.000 --> 22:58.670
Uh, Rose.

23:02.170 --> 23:05.240
What-- What are you--
 I was on a--
 I was on a call nearby,

23:05.240 --> 23:06.940
and I just thought
I would--

23:07.710 --> 23:09.250
Um--

23:09.250 --> 23:10.990
You know, we didn’t really
get to talk yesterday,

23:10.990 --> 23:14.220
other than the whole--
whole thing.

23:14.220 --> 23:17.290
And I just wanted you to know
that when the call came in,

23:17.290 --> 23:19.790
I had no idea
it was gonna be you.

23:19.790 --> 23:21.460
So, I’m sorry
if that was weird.

23:21.460 --> 23:23.390
It’s your job. I get it.

23:24.960 --> 23:26.260
How you been?

23:26.260 --> 23:28.300
Joel, why are you here?

23:29.760 --> 23:32.010
You know, like I said,
I was on a call nearby,
and I just,

23:32.010 --> 23:33.600
you know,
thought I would...

23:34.900 --> 23:37.640
come check on you.

23:37.640 --> 23:41.310
After everything that
happened yesterday, that’s--
that’s not an easy thing.

23:41.310 --> 23:44.840
Okay. I appreciate it,
but I don’t need you
to check on me.

23:49.290 --> 23:51.030
Right.

23:51.030 --> 23:53.850
No, yeah, I mean-- Sorry.

23:55.260 --> 23:56.790
I have to get back to work.

23:56.790 --> 23:58.130
Yeah.

23:58.130 --> 23:59.400
See you around.

24:06.540 --> 24:08.170
You do know
she’s engaged, right?

24:10.610 --> 24:12.110
Yeah.

24:14.150 --> 24:15.840
I’m single.

24:51.710 --> 24:53.780
Hello.
       Hi.

24:53.780 --> 24:56.350
Um, look,
I just wanted to say sorry
about last night, okay?

24:56.350 --> 24:59.490
I shouldn’t have
kept going at you like that.

24:59.490 --> 25:00.920
Uh, no, I--

25:01.520 --> 25:03.230
I should apologize.

25:04.130 --> 25:06.330
I’ve been just dealing
with some stuff.

25:06.330 --> 25:08.960
I wasn’t being
very good company.

25:08.960 --> 25:11.700
Okay. If you can’t make it to
your nephew’s party tomorrow,

25:11.700 --> 25:14.140
you could at least
get him a present.

25:14.140 --> 25:17.410
If you need an idea,
he’s really into
electric model trains.

25:17.410 --> 25:19.000
Uh-huh.

25:19.000 --> 25:21.410
You sound weird.
Are you okay?

25:21.410 --> 25:23.580
Yeah, no, I’m fine.

25:49.180 --> 25:50.610
Hey, Carl.

25:52.250 --> 25:54.180
How you feeling today?

26:04.820 --> 26:06.080
Carl.

26:11.330 --> 26:12.600
Carl?

26:18.470 --> 26:21.130
She’s gonna die.
I’m gonna die.

26:21.130 --> 26:22.970
 Everybody dies.
Carl, look at me.

26:22.970 --> 26:28.380
You’re going to die.

26:28.380 --> 26:35.150
You’re going to die.
You’re going to die.

26:35.150 --> 26:36.950
You’re going to die.
           Help!

26:36.950 --> 26:39.260
Help! This patient is 5150!

26:39.260 --> 26:41.200
He needs to be restrained!
            Go, go, go!

26:42.590 --> 26:44.430
No! No!

26:44.430 --> 26:45.690
No!

26:46.200 --> 26:50.240
No! No! No! No!

26:50.240 --> 26:55.070
No! No!

26:55.070 --> 26:57.410
No!

27:07.850 --> 27:09.550
He was aggressive.

27:10.110 --> 27:12.520
Acting psychotic.

27:12.520 --> 27:15.230
Carl Renken has been
in and out of here
a dozen times

27:15.230 --> 27:18.530
and has never exhibited behavior
even remotely aggressive.

27:18.530 --> 27:20.830
        Do you think
        I’m making it up?
Of course not.

27:20.830 --> 27:23.240
But yesterday,
a patient in your care

27:23.240 --> 27:25.830
killed herself brutally
in front of you.

27:26.670 --> 27:28.640
Is it possible,
when you presumed

27:28.640 --> 27:30.610
that Carl Renken
was a danger to himself,

27:30.610 --> 27:32.970
that that’s what your mind
was reacting to?

27:36.320 --> 27:40.250
I suppose
I could’ve misinterpreted
the situation and overreacted.

27:43.020 --> 27:44.260
Okay.

27:44.260 --> 27:46.890
So, here’s what’s gonna happen.

27:47.990 --> 27:50.060
You’re gonna take
a paid week off.

27:50.060 --> 27:51.930
Morgan,
that’s really not necessary.

27:51.930 --> 27:55.400
You’ve been working
80-hour weeks for months.

27:55.400 --> 27:58.230
I’m concerned
that you haven’t been sleeping.

27:58.230 --> 28:02.070
We can’t help these patients
unless we have
our own mental health in check.

28:02.070 --> 28:04.000
And it’s in
the unit’s best interest

28:04.000 --> 28:06.200
if you just take a week
and clear your head.

28:06.200 --> 28:09.480
Just do what you gotta do
and come back focused, okay?

31:22.510 --> 31:23.840
Fuck!

32:33.980 --> 32:37.240
Hello?
This is First Line Security.

32:37.240 --> 32:39.620
May I have your name
and the passcode?

32:39.620 --> 32:41.620
Uh, Rose Cotter.

32:41.620 --> 32:43.220
Um, "Acapulco."

32:43.220 --> 32:44.990
Ma’am, we’ve detected
a door alarm.

32:44.990 --> 32:48.830
Yeah, uh, the--
the back door
of my house is open.

32:48.830 --> 32:50.760
Are you alone
in the house, ma’am?

32:51.220 --> 32:52.520
Yes.

32:52.520 --> 32:53.960
Are you sure?

32:55.670 --> 32:59.710
           What?
Are you sure you haven’t
let something inside, Rose?

33:02.330 --> 33:04.040
Look behind you.

33:34.430 --> 33:35.710
Shit.

33:43.380 --> 33:44.720
Hello?

33:44.720 --> 33:46.310
This is First Line Security.

33:46.310 --> 33:48.480
May I have your name
and the passcode?

34:09.400 --> 34:11.810
We did a full sweep
inside and out.
It’s all clear.

34:12.600 --> 34:14.949
Um, what about the back door?

34:14.949 --> 34:18.150
Is it possible
it wasn’t fully latched
last time it was closed?

34:19.610 --> 34:21.850
I-- I don’t know.
Maybe.

34:21.850 --> 34:23.219
Hey,
I wouldn’t worry about it.

34:23.219 --> 34:25.889
These false alarms
happen all the time.

34:25.889 --> 34:28.489
If anything else comes up,
you can give us a call.

34:29.360 --> 34:30.489
Okay.

34:31.420 --> 34:32.900
Evening, sir.

34:32.900 --> 34:35.489
Um, evening.

34:39.130 --> 34:40.500
What happened?

34:43.940 --> 34:45.239
Mustache?

34:46.909 --> 34:48.750
Mustache.

34:48.750 --> 34:52.280
So, is there a reason
you set the alarm?

34:52.280 --> 34:53.179
Uh--

34:54.150 --> 34:56.050
I literally
don’t remember doing it.

34:56.050 --> 34:59.150
I must have just, like,
set it by accident or something.

35:00.790 --> 35:02.190
By accident?

35:03.760 --> 35:05.160
Sorry. Sorry.

35:05.160 --> 35:07.330
My head has just been
in this, like,

35:07.330 --> 35:10.300
foggy, creepy,
spacey place all day.

35:10.300 --> 35:13.330
And there was
this weird incident
at work and then--

35:13.330 --> 35:15.710
and then my boss
is making me take a--

35:19.600 --> 35:22.010
Sorry.

35:22.010 --> 35:25.020
Everything is okay.
Are you sure?

35:25.020 --> 35:28.080
No, no, I’m fine.
I was just venting.

35:29.990 --> 35:31.350
Okay.

35:36.290 --> 35:38.060
Can you see
if you can find Mustache?

35:38.060 --> 35:40.060
I haven’t seen him
anywhere at all.

35:40.060 --> 35:41.300
Yeah.

35:47.810 --> 35:50.110
Rose, did you
break another glass?

35:54.850 --> 35:56.210
Mustache?

35:59.640 --> 36:01.080
Come on, kitty.

36:03.650 --> 36:05.790
Please. Please.

36:09.590 --> 36:10.960
Mustache.

37:06.510 --> 37:09.250
It looks like people.
It looks like different people.

37:09.250 --> 37:11.750
Sometimes it pretends
to be someone that I know.

37:11.750 --> 37:14.690
Sometimes it’s
a random stranger.
Sometimes--

37:14.690 --> 37:17.290
Sometimes it looks like
my grandfather

37:17.290 --> 37:20.160
who died in front of me
when I was seven.

37:20.160 --> 37:22.730
But it’s all the same thing.
It--

37:22.730 --> 37:25.470
It’s smiling at me,
but not a friendly smile.

37:25.470 --> 37:27.760
It’s the worst smile
I’ve ever seen in my life.

37:27.760 --> 37:30.570
And whenever I see it,
I just get
this god-awful feeling

37:30.570 --> 37:33.800
like something really terrible
is gonna happen.

37:35.110 --> 37:37.950
Oh, my God! No! No!

37:37.950 --> 37:40.780
No! It’s here! Please!

37:40.780 --> 37:43.650
Get away! Please! No!

37:45.250 --> 37:47.490
       I-- I have
a patient emergency in eval 2.

37:47.490 --> 37:50.330
I need staff here now. Hurry.

37:52.060 --> 37:53.360
Laura?

38:04.240 --> 38:05.440
Laura?

38:16.580 --> 38:18.450
Laura?

38:18.450 --> 38:20.720
Rose.

38:28.630 --> 38:30.170
Laura?

38:38.980 --> 38:40.510
Rose!

38:51.680 --> 38:53.090
Rose?

38:53.090 --> 38:55.850
Whoa! Oh, my God! Rose!
Rose! Whoa, whoa!

38:55.850 --> 38:58.330
What the fuck?
Rose, put the knife down!

39:02.530 --> 39:03.560
Rose!

39:21.990 --> 39:23.220
Hi.

39:24.880 --> 39:26.260
Rose?

39:27.650 --> 39:29.330
This is a surprise.

39:31.920 --> 39:34.730
It wasn’t so much the blood.

39:34.730 --> 39:36.100
It was, um...

39:37.200 --> 39:39.070
her face.

39:39.070 --> 39:41.010
The look that she had.

39:42.110 --> 39:43.500
How did it
make you feel?

39:45.210 --> 39:46.280
Uh--

39:46.840 --> 39:48.670
Terrified, obviously.

39:50.840 --> 39:51.940
Um--

39:52.880 --> 39:54.450
Vulnerable.

39:54.940 --> 39:56.290
Guilty.

39:56.680 --> 39:57.820
Guilty?

39:58.550 --> 40:00.420
Well, she was my patient.

40:00.420 --> 40:04.590
She was a disturbed young woman
you only met for ten minutes.

40:04.590 --> 40:06.630
Yeah. I just--

40:08.070 --> 40:09.830
I just feel like
I’ve gotten stuck on it.

40:09.830 --> 40:12.340
I can’t, you know,
get it out of my head.

40:12.340 --> 40:16.140
Have you considered
the reason you feel stuck

40:16.140 --> 40:18.900
could actually be more about
your mother’s suicide?

40:23.580 --> 40:25.650
Do you still blame yourself?

40:27.450 --> 40:29.150
That--

40:29.150 --> 40:30.910
I’m really not trying
to relitigate

40:30.910 --> 40:33.850
that part of my life
right now. So...

40:35.420 --> 40:37.460
What would you like
to talk about?

40:38.790 --> 40:44.570
I was hoping that I could get
a script for Risperdal.

40:50.740 --> 40:52.210
Ever since that...

40:54.150 --> 40:56.010
patient, I’ve been, um...

40:57.680 --> 40:59.680
seeing things

41:00.610 --> 41:02.390
and hearing things.

41:03.750 --> 41:06.690
I’m sure it’s just a symptom
of post-trauma.

41:06.690 --> 41:09.260
Let’s avoid
any self-diagnosis.

41:10.760 --> 41:13.130
What is it you’ve been seeing
and hearing?

41:16.760 --> 41:19.630
Echoes of what happened
with my patient.

41:19.630 --> 41:22.210
You know,
just fleeting moments

41:22.210 --> 41:24.570
of stress-induced
hallucinations.

41:25.970 --> 41:29.940
But when they’re happening,
they feel so...

41:31.180 --> 41:35.190
corporeal and unsettling.

41:37.010 --> 41:40.620
Rose, from where I’m sitting,
you don’t seem delusional
or disordered to me.

41:41.490 --> 41:43.490
And certainly not psychotic.

41:43.490 --> 41:46.400
It’s my impression
 this experience
with your patient

41:46.400 --> 41:47.990
triggered old anxieties

41:47.990 --> 41:50.300
compounded
with too much stress,
not enough sleep.

41:50.300 --> 41:54.110
You have wounds
that have never fully healed.

41:56.140 --> 41:59.440
And it is possible
they never will completely.
That’s the nature of trauma.

41:59.440 --> 42:02.910
But you can learn
to get control over it.

42:04.320 --> 42:07.350
Have you been continuing
to see patients

42:07.350 --> 42:09.190
while you’ve been coping
with all this?

42:09.190 --> 42:13.130
           No. I’m just taking
           a short hiatus.
Good.

42:14.560 --> 42:16.200
If you want my advice,

42:16.200 --> 42:17.920
use this time
to do something different.

42:17.920 --> 42:20.330
Anything that will
take your mind off

42:20.330 --> 42:22.600
the triggers
that are causing you stress.

42:22.600 --> 42:26.140
I also think
it would be helpful

42:27.240 --> 42:29.800
if we resumed
our regular sessions again.

42:34.740 --> 42:36.110
Sure.

42:40.880 --> 42:43.850
And what about the Risperdal?
Just-- You know.

42:43.850 --> 42:47.620
Let’s talk again next week
before we consider
any medication.

42:49.590 --> 42:52.020
In the meantime,
you can always call me.

42:55.760 --> 42:57.090
Sure.

43:28.760 --> 43:32.440
No, I asked you for
a white wine spritzer. Jesus.

43:33.830 --> 43:36.470
    Oh, my God. You made it.
Hi. Surprise.

43:36.470 --> 43:38.040
Come on in. Come on in.
Oh.

43:38.870 --> 43:40.910
I thought you had to work?

43:40.910 --> 43:43.510
Oh, I decided
to take the afternoon...
 I’ll take that.

43:43.510 --> 43:45.220
Hey, Greg.
What are you doing?

43:45.220 --> 43:47.650
I told you
not to take those out yet.
Mmm, mmm.

43:47.650 --> 43:49.320
Geez.

43:49.320 --> 43:51.260
Uh, ladies,
I have to go corral
my dipshit husband.

43:51.260 --> 43:54.080
Would one of you
please show my sister
to the adult refreshments?

43:54.080 --> 43:56.530
Sure. We have a stash
in the kitchen. Come on.

43:56.530 --> 43:58.690
Wait.
You’re that therapist, right?

43:58.690 --> 43:59.990
Yes, I-- I am.

43:59.990 --> 44:01.830
Oh! Fantastic.
Can I ask for advice?

44:01.830 --> 44:16.210
♪

44:42.900 --> 44:45.870
So cool.

44:45.870 --> 44:49.110
Harper.
Harper’s mom.

44:54.140 --> 44:56.080
Ooh, that one’s
from Aunt Rose.

44:58.920 --> 45:00.120
Open it!

45:01.150 --> 45:02.630
Rip it open!

45:18.000 --> 45:19.350
What’d you get,
sweetheart?

45:33.850 --> 45:35.560
No. No.

45:35.560 --> 45:39.090
Oh, my God.
No, no. Mustache.

45:41.960 --> 45:44.290
What the hell is wrong
with you?

45:44.290 --> 45:46.000
This can’t be happening.

45:50.870 --> 45:54.410
No. No, no.
No, I promise you,
this wasn’t me.

45:54.410 --> 45:57.910
It wasn’t.
It wasn’t me, I swear.

45:57.910 --> 46:00.980
You have to--
You guys have to
believe me, please.

46:00.980 --> 46:04.150
Somebody
please fucking believe me.

46:13.030 --> 46:17.100
What the fuck are you?
Leave me the fuck alone!

46:17.100 --> 46:20.260
You see her.
You have to see her.

46:20.260 --> 46:23.270
Please, Holly,
tell me that you see somebody.

46:23.270 --> 46:24.480
Please.

46:32.780 --> 46:34.390
Oh, my God.
Oh, God.

46:55.870 --> 46:57.640
Hey, Rose.

46:58.330 --> 46:59.340
Fuck.

47:00.940 --> 47:02.580
I heard you were brought
into the ER.

47:02.580 --> 47:04.650
I wanted to come check on you.
How’re you doing?

47:05.520 --> 47:07.150
Fine.

47:07.150 --> 47:09.950
It was just an accident.
Thank you.

47:09.950 --> 47:14.250
Yeah. They--
They said that you had
had a anxiety attack.

47:15.530 --> 47:17.600
Rose, I’ll be honest with you,
I’m-- I’m concerned.

47:17.600 --> 47:19.160
And I-- I mean this
as your friend,

47:19.160 --> 47:21.390
but I really think
you should speak
to someone.

47:21.390 --> 47:23.730
Are you seeing anybody
professionally right now?

47:29.900 --> 47:31.680
Rose, are you listening?

47:56.390 --> 47:57.500
Wait.

47:58.390 --> 48:00.330
I need to tell you something,

48:00.330 --> 48:06.240
and I need you to know
that I’m not crazy, okay?

48:06.840 --> 48:09.110
Okay.

48:10.040 --> 48:11.180
Um--

48:12.310 --> 48:16.590
Something is happening to me.

48:20.450 --> 48:23.350
And it’s gonna be really hard
for you to believe.

48:26.290 --> 48:28.420
Maybe we should
just go inside.

48:28.420 --> 48:31.640
No, wait. Just listen to me!
Sorry. Sorry.

48:32.430 --> 48:33.940
I’m really sorry.

48:34.430 --> 48:35.840
Okay, um--

48:37.770 --> 48:39.510
Something is threatening me.

48:40.470 --> 48:45.950
Some kind of a evil spirit,
or energy.

48:45.950 --> 48:50.720
I-- I don’t really know
what it is, but--

48:50.720 --> 48:54.190
but I think that it--
it killed my patient.

48:54.190 --> 48:58.630
Because she described
experiencing the same thing
before she died.

48:58.630 --> 49:02.570
And now it’s somehow
attached itself to me.

49:04.030 --> 49:05.200
And...

49:06.500 --> 49:07.800
I’m just really scared

49:07.800 --> 49:10.500
that something bad
is going to happen.

49:16.680 --> 49:18.780
I really need you
to say something.

49:19.820 --> 49:21.690
What do you want me to say?

49:26.190 --> 49:27.630
I want you to believe me.

49:27.630 --> 49:29.830
Rose, you’re talking about
a fucking ghost.

49:29.830 --> 49:31.860
No, no, no. It’s not--

49:31.860 --> 49:33.320
It’s not a ghost.

49:34.190 --> 49:36.000
It’s something else.

49:36.000 --> 49:37.330
Okay.

49:41.000 --> 49:42.430
I’m sorry.

49:43.500 --> 49:44.640
I can’t.

49:45.610 --> 49:47.370
I cannot fucking do this
right now.

49:47.370 --> 49:49.010
No. Trevor.

49:49.010 --> 49:51.240
Whoa, whoa, wait.
   No, no, no.
Don’t walk away.

49:52.510 --> 49:53.950
I need you--

49:53.950 --> 49:55.310
You’re not listening
to what I am saying.

49:55.310 --> 49:57.220
Okay, Rose.

49:57.220 --> 50:01.520
What the fuck am I
supposed to say to respond
to this right now?

50:01.520 --> 50:04.060
Do you hear yourself?
I mean, Jesus Christ.
You sound crazy.

50:04.060 --> 50:05.900
I am not crazy!

50:05.900 --> 50:07.770
Sorry. Sorry.

50:08.630 --> 50:10.490
But it’s genetic,
isn’t it?

50:11.530 --> 50:12.900
What?

50:14.070 --> 50:15.500
Mental illness.

50:16.470 --> 50:18.570
You can inherit it
from a parent.

50:18.570 --> 50:19.710
I looked it up.

50:19.710 --> 50:21.240
Why would you
look that up?

50:22.210 --> 50:24.880
Because...
I wanted to know

50:24.880 --> 50:28.210
what I was potentially
hitching my entire life to.

50:29.550 --> 50:31.420
Is that
so fucking unfair?

50:34.090 --> 50:35.630
I’m going in the house.

50:35.630 --> 50:38.060
No, no, no.
Please, Trevor.
I’m in danger!

50:38.060 --> 50:39.230
Rose.

50:40.030 --> 50:42.100
Did you kill Mustache?
N-- No!

50:42.100 --> 50:45.870
No! That was not--
That was not me.

50:45.870 --> 50:49.100
Then tell me,
what happened to him?

50:50.680 --> 50:53.040
It was the thing.

50:54.210 --> 50:56.210
Trevor, please.

50:56.210 --> 50:58.080
Please. Please.

50:59.280 --> 51:01.380
Please. Please.

52:16.060 --> 52:17.730
Rose.

52:26.840 --> 52:28.170
Come here.

52:57.800 --> 52:58.940
Rose.

53:01.840 --> 53:03.200
Baby...

53:04.240 --> 53:07.080
Please. Help me.

53:08.440 --> 53:11.510
  Mommy made a mistake.
No, no, no.

53:14.180 --> 53:15.580
No, no, no.

53:18.620 --> 53:19.960
Rose!

53:19.960 --> 53:21.260
Look where you’re going!

53:21.260 --> 53:23.620
Are you crazy?
Sorry. I’m sorry.

53:46.380 --> 53:47.680
Mrs. Muñoz?

53:50.580 --> 53:52.220
At first,

53:52.220 --> 53:54.520
I noticed
small changes in him.

53:57.290 --> 53:59.760
Then it all happened so fast.

54:01.630 --> 54:03.200
He was on edge.

54:04.000 --> 54:05.460
Paranoid.

54:07.100 --> 54:10.470
He would wake up
in the middle of the night,
screaming.

54:12.640 --> 54:14.880
I’d never heard him
scream before.

54:17.340 --> 54:20.350
Then he just
stopped sleeping altogether.

54:23.280 --> 54:26.820
I would catch him having
these conversations
with himself.

54:26.820 --> 54:28.490
He was seeing things.

54:29.390 --> 54:30.720
Doing strange things

54:30.720 --> 54:32.930
that he didn’t even
seem to remember.

54:33.660 --> 54:35.560
Then one morning he was gone.

54:37.100 --> 54:41.240
That night, the police called
and told me he was dead.

54:44.830 --> 54:46.800
They asked me
to identify his body.

54:47.770 --> 54:50.050
His face.

54:52.210 --> 54:54.450
Twenty-five years of marriage,

54:54.450 --> 54:57.380
and that’s what I have left
to remember him.

55:01.120 --> 55:03.090
I’m so sorry.

55:13.970 --> 55:19.210
Did Gabriel ever describe
the things that he was seeing?

55:23.810 --> 55:25.120
I’ll show you.

55:36.820 --> 55:38.820
I should take it all down,

55:39.820 --> 55:41.890
but I can’t stand
being in here.

56:00.680 --> 56:03.420
This is what Gabriel said
he saw.

56:11.690 --> 56:15.760
He kept saying it was trying
to get inside of him.

56:18.230 --> 56:20.930
That is Gabriel’s brother.

56:20.930 --> 56:24.570
He died in an accident
20 years ago.

56:24.570 --> 56:27.640
Gabriel never got over it.

56:27.640 --> 56:29.770
How long
had this been going on?

56:29.770 --> 56:33.150
Ever since he got back
from that damn conference
he would go to every year.

56:34.940 --> 56:38.220
It was because he saw
that awful woman kill herself.

56:39.920 --> 56:41.690
But no one
reports on that.

56:44.130 --> 56:47.130
He watched someone
die by suicide?

56:48.730 --> 56:49.790
Yes.

56:50.430 --> 56:51.560
I assumed you knew this.

56:51.560 --> 56:53.010
What was her name?

56:54.300 --> 56:56.730
I don’t remember.
I’d have to find it.

56:59.900 --> 57:01.050
Um--

57:01.970 --> 57:04.640
Did-- Did he ever, um...

57:06.780 --> 57:08.650
say why
all of this was happening?

57:08.650 --> 57:12.120
Did he find any explanation
in all of this?

57:14.060 --> 57:15.620
What kind of reporter
are you?

57:15.620 --> 57:20.160
Mrs. Muñoz,
your husband was not insane.

57:20.160 --> 57:23.730
The things that he was seeing,
they’re real. I’ve seen them.

57:23.730 --> 57:26.630
What are you,
a fucking nutcase?

57:26.630 --> 57:28.300
              What?
Some kind of
morbid fanatic?

57:28.300 --> 57:30.110
How fucking dare you?

57:30.110 --> 57:31.770
No, please. Please.

57:31.770 --> 57:34.340
What happened
to your husband
is happening to me.

57:34.340 --> 57:36.580
Out of my house.
I want you
out of my house, now.

57:36.580 --> 57:38.970
 Just please give me the name.
Please, just give me the name!

57:38.970 --> 57:41.520
Get the fuck
out of my house!

58:17.490 --> 58:19.220
Oh, fuck. Shit.

58:31.990 --> 58:33.240
Yeah?

58:39.710 --> 58:40.900
Hey.

58:47.550 --> 58:48.980
Come on in.

59:02.830 --> 59:06.270
Finally got rid of
that ugly yellow couch.

59:07.440 --> 59:08.770
Uh-huh.

59:09.410 --> 59:11.510
So, uh, what’s up?

59:12.610 --> 59:14.670
I assume you’re not here
to catch up

59:14.670 --> 59:17.680
considering the cold shoulder
the other day.

59:19.480 --> 59:21.810
   I need a favor.

59:21.810 --> 59:24.190
I need you to not ask
any questions about it.

59:24.190 --> 59:27.080
Terrific.
Yeah, let’s hear that.

59:27.080 --> 59:28.990
Uh, so, nine days ago,

59:28.990 --> 59:32.560
a man named Gabriel Muñoz
killed himself.

59:32.560 --> 59:38.370
I need to know if he had
been involved in any other
recent police reports.

59:38.370 --> 59:41.030
Can you find that out?
Here, for me.

59:41.030 --> 59:42.830
Come on. Are you serious?

59:44.510 --> 59:47.070
This is my one day off.
Go to the station.

59:47.070 --> 59:48.510
Joel, please?

59:55.290 --> 59:56.450
Fine.

59:57.320 --> 59:58.750
Goddamn it.

01:00:03.260 --> 01:00:05.150
All right,
what was his name again?

01:00:05.790 --> 01:00:07.530
Gabriel Muñoz.

01:00:15.740 --> 01:00:18.570
All right.
I see the report on his death.

01:00:18.570 --> 01:00:20.770
Yeah. There’s another
incident report here

01:00:20.770 --> 01:00:23.310
from a week earlier,
from a precinct upstate.

01:00:23.310 --> 01:00:26.480
                What was it for?
He gave a witness statement.

01:00:26.480 --> 01:00:29.140
He was staying at a hotel
where a woman
committed suicide.

01:00:29.140 --> 01:00:32.050
Okay, um--
And what was her name?
The woman?

01:00:36.120 --> 01:00:37.530
Um,

01:00:37.530 --> 01:00:39.530
Angela Powell.

01:00:39.530 --> 01:00:41.160
She’s a real estate agent.

01:00:41.160 --> 01:00:42.370
What is this?

01:00:44.500 --> 01:00:46.540
  Fuck.
What? What is it?

01:00:47.500 --> 01:00:49.070
It’s a picture from the scene.

01:00:49.070 --> 01:00:51.170
Let me see it.
No.

01:00:51.170 --> 01:00:52.870
Let me see it.
No, no.

01:00:52.870 --> 01:00:54.810
Look, you don’t wanna see this.
This is, like, evidence.

01:00:54.810 --> 01:00:57.110
Or, just,
you know, have at it.

01:01:00.450 --> 01:01:01.750
Holy shit.

01:01:03.210 --> 01:01:05.080
Told you it was gross.

01:01:07.080 --> 01:01:08.330
Okay, um--

01:01:10.220 --> 01:01:13.530
Okay, uh, I need you to do
the same search again,
but this time on her.

01:01:13.530 --> 01:01:14.990
The woman, Angela.

01:01:14.990 --> 01:01:16.730
Can you please tell me
what this is all about?

01:01:16.730 --> 01:01:19.830
Joel, you said you weren’t
gonna ask me any questions.

01:01:19.830 --> 01:01:22.030
No. You said I wouldn’t
ask you any questions.

01:01:22.030 --> 01:01:24.000
Joel, I need your help.

01:01:24.970 --> 01:01:26.280
Okay?

01:01:29.510 --> 01:01:30.710
Please?

01:01:48.700 --> 01:01:49.730
Hmm.

01:01:49.730 --> 01:01:51.370
There was a previous report

01:01:51.370 --> 01:01:53.900
filed four days
before her death.

01:01:55.200 --> 01:01:56.800
That’s a weird coincidence.

01:01:56.800 --> 01:01:59.170
She was also interviewed
about a suicide.

01:02:08.950 --> 01:02:11.460
What is this?
Is that a video file?

01:02:14.720 --> 01:02:17.250
It’s, um,
security camera footage.

01:02:17.250 --> 01:02:20.430
           Put it-- Put it on.
Just-- It’s--
It’s loading.

01:02:30.270 --> 01:02:32.170
What the fuck is this?

01:03:04.510 --> 01:03:06.640
You know,
my day was going just fine.

01:03:06.640 --> 01:03:08.780
           Can you rewind it?
Really?

01:03:08.780 --> 01:03:10.420
Rewind it, Joel.

01:03:15.780 --> 01:03:16.750
Okay, stop.

01:03:23.430 --> 01:03:25.120
Is he smiling?

01:03:34.360 --> 01:03:36.270
Rose, who are these people?

01:03:44.520 --> 01:03:46.040
I have to go.

01:03:46.810 --> 01:03:48.280
Where are you going?

01:03:50.210 --> 01:03:53.020
Rose, where are you going?
What is going on here?

01:03:53.020 --> 01:03:54.560
I’m so confused right now.

01:03:54.560 --> 01:03:56.150
Can you do me
one more favor?

01:03:56.860 --> 01:03:58.350
Do you have a printer?

01:04:37.390 --> 01:04:39.670
Trevor. Trevor, you here?

01:04:40.870 --> 01:04:42.070
Hey.

01:04:42.070 --> 01:04:43.610
Hi, Rose.

01:04:45.870 --> 01:04:48.210
What is this?
What is she doing here?

01:04:48.210 --> 01:04:50.080
I wanted to see
how you were doing.

01:04:50.080 --> 01:04:52.080
I was talking to my fiancé.

01:04:53.720 --> 01:04:54.780
I called her.

01:04:56.880 --> 01:04:57.980
Why?

01:04:59.590 --> 01:05:04.120
Because you’ve been acting
completely unhinged.

01:05:04.120 --> 01:05:05.530
I-- I don’t--

01:05:05.530 --> 01:05:07.160
And I-- I didn’t know
what else to do.

01:05:07.160 --> 01:05:08.830
Are you fucking kidding me?

01:05:10.460 --> 01:05:13.870
I came to you,
the person I’m supposed
to trust most in the world,

01:05:13.870 --> 01:05:18.000
and I-- I confided
that I was scared to death.

01:05:18.580 --> 01:05:21.300
That I needed you.

01:05:23.040 --> 01:05:25.140
And you didn’t listen
to a word I was saying.

01:05:25.140 --> 01:05:27.750
No. Why do you think
I even called her?

01:05:27.750 --> 01:05:29.980
All I’m trying to do here
is help you.

01:05:29.980 --> 01:05:33.020
No! All you’re trying to do
is make it so you don’t
have to deal with it.

01:05:33.020 --> 01:05:36.790
You’re fine
as long as everything is
easy and agreeable,

01:05:36.790 --> 01:05:39.290
but God forbid
anything become real,

01:05:39.290 --> 01:05:41.130
or even a tiny bit difficult.

01:05:41.130 --> 01:05:43.430
And-- And you just--

01:05:43.430 --> 01:05:47.000
You just think about how
it’s gonna fuck up your
whole little perfect life plan.

01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:49.970
Are you serious right now?
 Yeah.

01:05:49.970 --> 01:05:52.500
If that’s how you feel,
then why are we even together?

01:05:53.550 --> 01:05:54.980
Maybe I just don’t know.

01:05:54.980 --> 01:05:56.580
Why don’t we all
just take a breath--

01:05:56.580 --> 01:05:59.580
Why don’t you just
fucking make yourself at home!

01:05:59.580 --> 01:06:02.350
Rose, are you
actually leaving right now?

01:06:13.960 --> 01:06:16.190
Greg.
Rose, what are you
doing here?

01:06:16.190 --> 01:06:17.530
Is Holly here?
I need to talk to her.

01:06:17.530 --> 01:06:19.300
I don’t think
that’s a good idea.

01:06:19.300 --> 01:06:21.400
Greg, let me talk
to my fucking sister. Holly!

01:06:21.400 --> 01:06:23.000
You’re gonna come
and talk to me like that?

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:24.810
Holly, can I talk to you,
just for one sec?

01:06:24.810 --> 01:06:26.500
           No, I don’t think--
Can I please talk to you?

01:06:26.500 --> 01:06:28.310
I don’t think
this is a good idea.
Honestly.

01:06:28.310 --> 01:06:30.180
Yeah, it’s fine.
It’s fine.
               Holly.

01:06:30.180 --> 01:06:33.210
Just go the fuck inside.
I don’t-- All right. Fine.

01:06:34.210 --> 01:06:35.540
Jesus.

01:06:36.720 --> 01:06:38.150
Okay, okay, okay.

01:06:40.690 --> 01:06:41.990
How are you?

01:06:42.860 --> 01:06:46.420
My eyes are open now.

01:06:47.390 --> 01:06:50.460
I have been cursed.

01:06:50.930 --> 01:06:52.100
Okay, uh--

01:06:52.100 --> 01:06:54.100
Or somehow wrapped up
in a curse.

01:06:54.100 --> 01:06:56.230
I-- I got it from my patient.

01:06:56.230 --> 01:06:59.910
She was cursed,
and then when she died, she--
she transferred it to me.

01:06:59.910 --> 01:07:05.410
And now I’m being threatened
by this-- this entity.

01:07:06.210 --> 01:07:07.750
          By an entity?
No, no.

01:07:07.750 --> 01:07:09.510
It--
It’s what killed Mustache.

01:07:09.510 --> 01:07:12.890
It was at the party yesterday,
but you couldn’t see it.

01:07:12.890 --> 01:07:15.420
Nobody else can see it,
except for me.

01:07:15.920 --> 01:07:17.060
Jesus Christ.

01:07:17.060 --> 01:07:18.260
No, look, Holly,

01:07:18.260 --> 01:07:20.390
I know
it’s so hard to believe,

01:07:20.390 --> 01:07:23.060
and it was difficult for me
to believe it at first either.

01:07:23.060 --> 01:07:24.900
But look-- look at this. Look.

01:07:24.900 --> 01:07:28.370
Oh, my God. Rose.
Why the fuck
do you have that?

01:07:28.370 --> 01:07:30.200
Because this has happened
to other people.

01:07:30.200 --> 01:07:31.710
And they’re all dead.
Rose.

01:07:31.710 --> 01:07:33.240
And I--
Holly, I’m gonna be next!

01:07:33.240 --> 01:07:35.540
Rose,
curses are not real.

01:07:35.540 --> 01:07:37.680
Okay? You are
having some sort of a--

01:07:39.210 --> 01:07:41.050
a breakdown.

01:07:41.050 --> 01:07:43.820
What? No, no. Holly.

01:07:44.580 --> 01:07:45.950
You’re not hearing me.

01:07:45.950 --> 01:07:48.790
You are not hearing me.
Rose.

01:07:48.790 --> 01:07:51.620
This is exactly
what happened to Mom.

01:07:56.930 --> 01:07:58.530
You sound just like her.

01:08:03.970 --> 01:08:05.810
How the fuck
would you know that?

01:08:06.400 --> 01:08:07.680
I’m sorry, what?

01:08:07.680 --> 01:08:09.470
You were never around
when Mom got bad.

01:08:09.470 --> 01:08:11.240
Where the fuck were you
when she died?

01:08:11.240 --> 01:08:13.980
You have no idea
what you’re talking about.

01:08:13.980 --> 01:08:16.850
Okay? Because I was older,
I got the worst
of Mom’s insanity.

01:08:16.850 --> 01:08:18.510
I had to fucking
leave the house.

01:08:18.510 --> 01:08:21.390
That was the only way
I-- I could survive.

01:08:22.760 --> 01:08:24.960
And I’m-- I’m sorry

01:08:26.590 --> 01:08:30.260
 that I left you alone
and that you had to be
 the one to find her.

01:08:30.260 --> 01:08:32.529
I know that
that fucked you up, and--

01:08:33.660 --> 01:08:35.100
And I know
that that’s not fair.

01:08:35.100 --> 01:08:36.770
I wish I could do
something about it,

01:08:36.770 --> 01:08:39.210
but, Rose,
I have tried so hard
to move on with my life,

01:08:39.210 --> 01:08:41.310
to leave all of that shit
behind me, okay?

01:08:41.310 --> 01:08:43.670
You, it’s like
you can’t accept the fact

01:08:43.670 --> 01:08:45.979
that Mom lost her mind
and fucking killed herself.

01:08:45.979 --> 01:08:47.580
And you let it
define your entire life,

01:08:47.580 --> 01:08:49.450
and you punish me
because I don’t want to.

01:08:49.450 --> 01:08:52.220
Well, I’m sorry
that I’m actually
trying to help people

01:08:52.220 --> 01:08:55.990
instead of being some fucking
stay-at-home PTA housewife,

01:08:55.990 --> 01:09:00.290
who lives in her own
  self-centered,
smug little bubble!

01:09:04.840 --> 01:09:07.040
                       Okay.
I don’t know
why I said that.

01:09:08.810 --> 01:09:12.600
You know what, I’m--
I’m not doing this.
I’m not doing this with you.

01:09:12.600 --> 01:09:14.910
You’ve completely
traumatized Jackson, okay?

01:09:16.340 --> 01:09:18.880
I can’t have you around
when you’re like this.

01:09:30.319 --> 01:09:31.590
Fuck.

01:09:33.029 --> 01:09:34.160
Fuck.

01:10:02.890 --> 01:10:04.930
Holly?

01:10:15.600 --> 01:10:19.040
Fuck! Fuck!

01:10:22.080 --> 01:10:24.310
Fuck!

01:10:24.950 --> 01:10:26.680
Motherfucker!

01:11:34.120 --> 01:11:36.350
Joel?
Why didn’t you tell me

01:11:36.350 --> 01:11:39.150
about your patient’s
connection to the others?

01:11:39.150 --> 01:11:40.990
Wha--
 After you left,
 I kept digging.

01:11:40.990 --> 01:11:42.780
These cases?

01:11:42.780 --> 01:11:44.560
This same pattern.
It goes back further.

01:11:44.560 --> 01:11:47.530
 So far, I’ve found 20 cases
involving 19 suicide victims

01:11:47.530 --> 01:11:49.630
with a direct line
linking them all together.

01:11:49.630 --> 01:11:52.500
And the things these people
are doing to themselves, Rose.

01:11:52.500 --> 01:11:54.140
Holy shit.

01:11:54.140 --> 01:11:57.630
Wait, you said, um, 20 cases,
but only 19 suicides.

01:11:57.630 --> 01:11:59.370
One of the cases
mixes up the pattern.

01:11:59.370 --> 01:12:01.370
Some accountant,
Robert Talley.

01:12:01.370 --> 01:12:03.710
His business partner
commits suicide
right in front of him,

01:12:03.710 --> 01:12:05.350
and four days later,
Talley goes

01:12:05.350 --> 01:12:07.310
and fucking murders a woman
he’s never met before,

01:12:07.310 --> 01:12:08.680
completely out of the blue.

01:12:08.680 --> 01:12:10.960
But get this, a week later,

01:12:10.960 --> 01:12:12.780
the key eyewitness
to the murder

01:12:12.780 --> 01:12:14.880
also commits suicide.

01:12:14.880 --> 01:12:16.220
Pattern resumes.

01:12:16.220 --> 01:12:18.260
 So, he’s alive?
Yeah.

01:12:18.260 --> 01:12:19.790
He’s sitting in holding
in Altoona.

01:12:20.530 --> 01:12:22.430
Joel, I gotta talk to him.

01:12:49.720 --> 01:12:51.190
I’m gonna need you
 to say something.

01:12:51.190 --> 01:12:52.850
Yeah, I-- I will.

01:12:52.850 --> 01:12:54.590
Just-- Just--

01:12:56.630 --> 01:12:58.270
Give me a second.
I mean, Jesus--

01:12:58.270 --> 01:13:00.700
I thought you were gonna say
this was some kind of, like,

01:13:00.700 --> 01:13:03.370
 crazy suicide cult,
or blackmail scheme.

01:13:03.370 --> 01:13:06.110
I mean, this? This is--
This? This is--
Hey, Joel.

01:13:08.240 --> 01:13:09.570
Okay.

01:13:09.570 --> 01:13:11.910
Let’s just put aside
the possibility

01:13:11.910 --> 01:13:13.380
that some sort of evil,

01:13:13.380 --> 01:13:15.120
extraordinary force
could even exist.

01:13:16.250 --> 01:13:17.520
What you’re saying

01:13:17.520 --> 01:13:19.680
is that this thing
 is jumping around

01:13:19.680 --> 01:13:21.060
from person to person,

01:13:21.060 --> 01:13:23.490
and it is causing them
to kill themselves?

01:13:23.490 --> 01:13:25.890
Okay,
but maybe it’s not suicide.

01:13:25.890 --> 01:13:27.200
What do you mean?

01:13:27.200 --> 01:13:29.690
Okay. So, my patient,
she was terrified,

01:13:29.690 --> 01:13:31.400
but she was not suicidal.

01:13:31.400 --> 01:13:34.630
And then at-- at the end,
everything about her changed.

01:13:34.630 --> 01:13:40.240
It was like the person I had
been talking to was gone.

01:13:41.510 --> 01:13:45.540
And something else
had taken over.

01:13:48.750 --> 01:13:51.250
So, it’s kind of like the guy...

01:13:51.250 --> 01:13:53.160
Yes.
...on the security camera
footage?

01:13:53.160 --> 01:13:55.220
Yes. Yes. Exactly like that.

01:13:55.220 --> 01:13:58.030
Oh, my God. What the fuck?

01:14:04.170 --> 01:14:06.500
In the cases that you found,
um...

01:14:08.400 --> 01:14:12.210
how long was it
between each victim’s death?

01:14:16.410 --> 01:14:18.510
None of them survived
longer than a week.

01:14:21.980 --> 01:14:25.850
Some of them didn’t even
 make it past four days.

01:14:31.850 --> 01:14:33.260
Today was my fourth day.

01:14:35.130 --> 01:14:36.400
Hey.

01:14:37.630 --> 01:14:39.030
Whatever happened
to those people,

01:14:39.030 --> 01:14:40.960
it’s not gonna happen to you.

01:14:43.770 --> 01:14:44.930
I promise.

01:15:05.790 --> 01:15:09.660
Transfer guard to gate three.

01:15:09.660 --> 01:15:10.890
Thank you.

01:15:10.890 --> 01:15:12.300
Give them a buzz through.

01:15:12.300 --> 01:15:14.470
  They’re clear.

01:15:15.470 --> 01:15:17.060
I owe you one
for this, Doug.

01:15:17.060 --> 01:15:19.900
You’re just lucky
that he fired every lawyer

01:15:19.900 --> 01:15:21.240
he was assigned.

01:15:21.240 --> 01:15:23.510
You do know
what this guy did, right?

01:15:23.510 --> 01:15:25.710
Well, Dr. Cotter’s building
a psychological profile

01:15:25.710 --> 01:15:27.420
on a similar case for us.

01:15:27.420 --> 01:15:30.390
Oh. Well, Talley’s
a whole box of fruit loops.

01:15:30.390 --> 01:15:32.010
So, good luck.

01:15:32.010 --> 01:15:34.050
Look, you only got
ten minutes with him, okay?

01:15:34.050 --> 01:15:36.260
It’s the best I could do
without a court order.

01:15:36.260 --> 01:15:38.050
Well, I appreciate it.

01:16:13.230 --> 01:16:16.060
Mr. Talley,
my name is
Dr. Rose Cotter,

01:16:16.060 --> 01:16:19.800
and, um, I was hoping
you’d be willing to

01:16:19.800 --> 01:16:21.870
answer some questions
about--

01:16:21.870 --> 01:16:24.370
I’m done answering questions.
I confessed.

01:16:24.370 --> 01:16:27.870
I actually don’t care about
what you were accused of.

01:16:27.870 --> 01:16:33.220
What I need to know
is what you experienced
in the days leading up to it.

01:16:38.420 --> 01:16:40.190
I have a patient,

01:16:41.120 --> 01:16:42.620
a young woman.

01:16:44.430 --> 01:16:45.760
Four days ago,

01:16:45.760 --> 01:16:48.500
a man killed himself
right in front of her.

01:16:48.500 --> 01:16:55.240
And ever since then,
she has been seeing something.

01:16:56.930 --> 01:16:59.540
Something that pretends
to be other people.

01:17:00.380 --> 01:17:03.450
The man that
she saw kill himself,

01:17:03.450 --> 01:17:07.650
he claimed that he was seeing
the exact same thing.

01:17:07.650 --> 01:17:09.980
What the fuck
do you want from me, huh?

01:17:09.980 --> 01:17:12.360
What is it?
I don’t know.

01:17:13.520 --> 01:17:14.650
I don’t know.

01:17:14.650 --> 01:17:16.080
Why is it that everybody else

01:17:16.080 --> 01:17:18.960
who’s seen it is dead
and you’re alive?

01:17:18.960 --> 01:17:20.330
Why? Please.

01:17:20.330 --> 01:17:22.660
Mr. Talley,
you can help her.
Okay?

01:17:23.120 --> 01:17:24.370
Please.

01:17:28.970 --> 01:17:30.130
Make the cop leave.

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:33.810
Not gonna happen, pal.

01:17:33.810 --> 01:17:37.450
Make him leave,
and I’ll tell you what I know.

01:17:40.680 --> 01:17:42.180
Joel, please.

01:17:47.820 --> 01:17:49.560
I’ll be outside,
all right?

01:18:02.470 --> 01:18:05.900
I tried to research anything
and everything I could
about this thing.

01:18:05.900 --> 01:18:08.350
There’s been other chains
in the past.

01:18:08.350 --> 01:18:11.170
Found one that was in Brazil
a few years ago.

01:18:13.980 --> 01:18:16.780
A man there escaped that chain

01:18:18.360 --> 01:18:21.520
by killing his neighbor
and passing it
to his neighbor’s wife.

01:18:22.430 --> 01:18:25.660
Your patient is going to die

01:18:25.660 --> 01:18:28.120
unless she kills someone.

01:18:28.120 --> 01:18:30.630
That’s the only way
you can get rid of it.

01:18:31.260 --> 01:18:33.060
The only way.

01:18:33.060 --> 01:18:35.540
She has to make sure there’s
a witness for it to pass to,

01:18:35.540 --> 01:18:37.700
’cause this thing needs trauma
to spread.

01:18:37.700 --> 01:18:41.440
That’s what gives it power.
Trauma.

01:18:41.440 --> 01:18:44.210
Your patient has to
make it count.

01:18:44.210 --> 01:18:46.850
Tell her to use
some kind of weapon.

01:18:46.850 --> 01:18:48.950
Make the biggest mess she can--

01:18:48.950 --> 01:18:51.820
I can’t kill someone!

01:18:53.180 --> 01:18:54.360
You?

01:18:55.120 --> 01:18:57.280
You have it?

01:18:58.690 --> 01:19:02.470
No, no, no.
Why the fuck did you come here?

01:19:02.470 --> 01:19:04.230
You’re not giving it
back to me.

01:19:04.230 --> 01:19:06.290
Get out of here!
I’m sorry.

01:19:06.290 --> 01:19:07.600
Get out of here!

01:19:07.600 --> 01:19:16.040
Get her away from me!

01:19:23.210 --> 01:19:24.490
Hey.

01:19:25.420 --> 01:19:27.150
Hey! Wait.

01:19:29.250 --> 01:19:31.050
   What happened in there?
Nothing.

01:19:31.790 --> 01:19:33.190
What’d he say?

01:19:34.830 --> 01:19:36.060
Nothing.

01:19:36.730 --> 01:19:38.770
Nothing?

01:19:38.770 --> 01:19:40.730
He’s out of his fucking mind,
Joel.

01:21:25.230 --> 01:21:26.610
Ah, fuck.

01:22:21.490 --> 01:22:23.460
What are you doing here?

01:22:23.460 --> 01:22:25.430
I apologize
if you felt ambushed yesterday.

01:22:25.430 --> 01:22:27.160
That was the wrong approach.

01:22:27.160 --> 01:22:28.330
   I’m sorry.
Yeah.

01:22:28.330 --> 01:22:30.710
I think you should go.
               Rose.

01:22:30.710 --> 01:22:33.610
We both know
I have a responsibility
to notify the authorities

01:22:33.610 --> 01:22:36.110
if you’re a danger
to yourself or others.

01:22:36.110 --> 01:22:38.950
I need you to help convince me
you’re not a danger.

01:22:51.860 --> 01:22:54.360
Trevor mentioned
 there had been
 talk of ghosts.

01:22:55.570 --> 01:22:57.700
I never used the word
"ghosts."

01:22:59.260 --> 01:23:01.940
Evil beings, then.
Paranormal.

01:23:04.470 --> 01:23:08.810
I admitted to him
that I was seeing things,
the same thing that I told you.

01:23:08.810 --> 01:23:10.410
That’s not happening anymore.
Okay?

01:23:10.410 --> 01:23:14.150
It was stress
and lack of sleep.

01:23:14.150 --> 01:23:16.920
I confided in him, and that
was obviously a mistake.

01:23:17.380 --> 01:23:19.150
But that’s it.

01:23:19.150 --> 01:23:21.120
Okay? Are we good?

01:23:22.480 --> 01:23:24.630
How are you feeling today?

01:23:28.160 --> 01:23:29.460
Let me think, um--

01:23:30.600 --> 01:23:33.000
I’m pretty sure my fiancé
thinks I’m crazy.

01:23:34.640 --> 01:23:39.810
My sister has just
totally shut me out.

01:23:39.810 --> 01:23:41.300
And now

01:23:42.170 --> 01:23:43.750
my former therapist

01:23:43.750 --> 01:23:47.150
is making unannounced
house calls

01:23:47.150 --> 01:23:49.650
to ensure that
I am not a danger.

01:23:49.650 --> 01:23:53.320
So, other than that,
I’m really good.

01:24:03.100 --> 01:24:05.060
Should you get that?

01:24:10.230 --> 01:24:11.500
What?

01:24:11.500 --> 01:24:14.170
Rose, it’s Madeline.

01:24:14.170 --> 01:24:17.180
I’ve been trying your mobile
all morning.

01:24:17.180 --> 01:24:20.010
I’m very concerned about
how we left things yesterday.

01:24:22.310 --> 01:24:25.550
Rose? Are you there?
      No.

01:24:30.790 --> 01:24:32.120
Hello?

01:24:32.960 --> 01:24:34.670
      No.
Rose?

01:24:35.460 --> 01:24:37.460
No. No.

01:24:37.460 --> 01:24:39.670
Almost time, Rose.

01:24:41.100 --> 01:24:42.940
What the fuck are you?

01:24:46.440 --> 01:24:47.710
Ple-- Please.

01:24:51.310 --> 01:24:52.540
No, no.

01:24:53.310 --> 01:24:55.250
No. No, no.

01:25:01.290 --> 01:25:02.650
No.

01:26:12.650 --> 01:26:14.620
Hey, Dr. Cotter.

01:26:14.620 --> 01:26:17.100
Aren’t you supposed to be
on leave?

01:26:17.100 --> 01:26:19.630
Just grabbing something
from my office.

01:26:59.170 --> 01:27:01.240
Carl. Hi.

01:27:05.240 --> 01:27:06.880
                   No. No.
It’s okay.

01:27:06.880 --> 01:27:08.480
No, no, no.

01:27:08.480 --> 01:27:10.320
It’s okay.
                Oh, God.

01:27:10.320 --> 01:27:12.480
No, no. Oh, no, no, no.

01:27:12.480 --> 01:27:14.780
Shh. Shh. Just calm down.
               No! No, no!

01:27:14.780 --> 01:27:17.930
No! No!
Shh! Shut the fuck up.

01:27:19.390 --> 01:27:21.060
Just calm down, okay? Okay.

01:27:21.060 --> 01:27:22.330
Rose.

01:27:23.200 --> 01:27:24.460
What are you doing here?

01:27:27.900 --> 01:27:29.430
I don’t know.

01:27:31.300 --> 01:27:33.470
Rose, you can’t
be around patients.

01:28:06.110 --> 01:28:07.800
Fuck! Rose!

01:28:27.820 --> 01:28:30.790
Fuck!

01:28:45.610 --> 01:28:47.540
Rose, what are you
doing here?

01:28:48.220 --> 01:28:49.580
Nothing.

01:28:50.680 --> 01:28:52.350
I don’t-- I don’t know.

01:28:52.350 --> 01:28:55.390
I don’t know why. I, uh--

01:28:55.390 --> 01:28:57.720
Why don’t we go inside together
and we can just talk?

01:28:57.720 --> 01:28:59.330
No! It’s--

01:28:59.330 --> 01:29:00.890
It’s not safe.

01:29:00.890 --> 01:29:03.030
Rose, I don’t think you should
be alone right now.

01:29:03.030 --> 01:29:04.660
I need--
I need to be alone.

01:29:06.830 --> 01:29:08.940
I need to be--
I need to be alone.

01:29:11.240 --> 01:29:13.770
I’m sorry. I’m sorry.
I have to go.

01:29:15.770 --> 01:29:18.380
Rose, I don’t think you should
go anywhere, okay?

01:29:18.380 --> 01:29:20.910
You just relax, I’m gonna make
a phone call, all right?

01:29:22.610 --> 01:29:24.190
Rose. Rose, don’t go anywhere.

01:29:24.190 --> 01:29:25.650
Wait. Rose, please.

01:29:25.650 --> 01:29:27.650
Please don’t go anywhere, okay?
Just hang--

01:29:27.650 --> 01:29:29.990
Rose. Rose, wait! Rose!

01:29:56.050 --> 01:29:59.120
                   Joel.
       Rose, I saw a police APB
go out for you

01:29:59.120 --> 01:30:01.120
that says you’re dangerous.
What the fuck happened?

01:30:01.120 --> 01:30:02.390
I know what I need to do.
 What?

01:30:02.390 --> 01:30:05.460
This thing, it needs
all of its victims

01:30:05.460 --> 01:30:07.230
to pass it on
in order to survive,

01:30:07.230 --> 01:30:10.300
but if there’s no one else
around, it has no way to pass.

01:30:10.300 --> 01:30:11.790
As long as I’m alone,

01:30:11.790 --> 01:30:13.470
I can deprive it
of what it needs.

01:30:13.470 --> 01:30:15.170
That doesn’t make any sense.

01:30:15.170 --> 01:30:17.440
 Your plan is just to
avoid people forever?

01:30:17.440 --> 01:30:20.180
I am not gonna
keep running, okay?

01:30:20.930 --> 01:30:22.570
I’ve got to face it.

01:30:22.570 --> 01:30:24.910
Okay, Rose, I’m coming to you.
Just tell me where--

01:33:54.880 --> 01:33:56.390
Rose.

01:34:00.730 --> 01:34:02.090
Baby...

01:34:07.300 --> 01:34:09.440
Help me, please.

01:34:13.340 --> 01:34:15.740
Mommy made a mistake.

01:34:22.520 --> 01:34:24.210
Get the phone.

01:34:25.350 --> 01:34:27.180
Call for help.

01:34:37.370 --> 01:34:39.300
Rose!

01:38:51.080 --> 01:38:53.520
Rose.

01:38:58.990 --> 01:39:00.490
It’s okay, baby.

01:39:01.160 --> 01:39:02.490
Come here.

01:39:13.810 --> 01:39:17.400
I am so sorry.

01:39:19.880 --> 01:39:21.980
I-- I haven’t been a good mom.

01:39:25.180 --> 01:39:30.220
I want to be.
I really try to be.

01:39:30.220 --> 01:39:36.360
But sometimes
everything is just too much.

01:39:37.730 --> 01:39:41.230
There is something terrible
inside of me.

01:39:42.200 --> 01:39:45.770
I hate myself.
Stop. Stop. Stop.

01:39:46.400 --> 01:39:48.010
Are you ashamed of me?

01:39:49.300 --> 01:39:50.400
No.

01:39:51.140 --> 01:39:52.750
Then why did you let me die?

01:39:56.750 --> 01:39:59.150
 Why didn’t you save me?
It’s not my fault.

01:39:59.150 --> 01:40:01.950
You could have called for help.
              Stop. Stop it.

01:40:01.950 --> 01:40:03.990
 But you didn’t.
Stop it.

01:40:03.990 --> 01:40:06.890
You wished that I would die.
Because I was afraid of you!

01:40:06.890 --> 01:40:09.600
I was ten years old

01:40:10.800 --> 01:40:13.000
and you were a monster.

01:40:15.530 --> 01:40:20.530
And I know that it’s not fair.
You-- You needed help.

01:40:22.170 --> 01:40:23.610
But I couldn’t.

01:40:28.540 --> 01:40:30.620
And I have carried that guilt

01:40:31.850 --> 01:40:35.090
for my entire life.

01:40:38.490 --> 01:40:41.990
And I--
I have to let it go.

01:40:44.100 --> 01:40:45.870
I ha-- I have to let it go.

01:40:52.710 --> 01:40:54.340
This is not real.

01:40:55.140 --> 01:40:57.110
But Rose,

01:40:57.110 --> 01:41:01.280
your mind makes it real.

01:41:05.580 --> 01:41:06.920
What are you?

01:41:08.120 --> 01:41:10.120
Why are you
doing this to me?

01:41:10.920 --> 01:41:12.490
Because your mind...

01:41:13.420 --> 01:41:15.760
...is so inviting.

01:42:06.610 --> 01:42:10.480
You can’t escape
your mind, Rose.

01:42:17.760 --> 01:42:18.730
It’s--

01:42:20.030 --> 01:42:22.900
It’s my mind.

01:42:30.230 --> 01:42:32.040
You can’t escape it either.

01:42:47.520 --> 01:42:49.390
Rose!

01:42:52.160 --> 01:42:53.800
Rose!

01:44:17.280 --> 01:44:19.180
Holy shit.

01:44:21.740 --> 01:44:23.410
Are you okay?

01:44:23.410 --> 01:44:26.020
           Can I just
           come in for a sec?
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

01:44:32.130 --> 01:44:33.590
Where have you
been?

01:44:38.100 --> 01:44:39.900
I’m sorry.

01:44:41.630 --> 01:44:47.340
I’m sorry for dragging you into
my whole fucked-up mess.

01:44:49.600 --> 01:44:51.440
For most of my life,

01:44:51.440 --> 01:44:57.650
I’ve been afraid of
letting people get too close,

01:44:58.650 --> 01:45:00.960
because I was afraid of...

01:45:03.990 --> 01:45:06.790
what they might see
if they really looked.

01:45:06.790 --> 01:45:11.860
And so I-- I put walls up,
and I kept people at a distance.

01:45:14.790 --> 01:45:16.070
And then...

01:45:19.500 --> 01:45:21.110
I met you,

01:45:21.110 --> 01:45:25.050
and I could feel
those walls coming down.

01:45:25.050 --> 01:45:28.080
And it scared the shit
out of me.

01:45:30.990 --> 01:45:32.450
And so...

01:45:33.620 --> 01:45:40.090
I was selfish,
and that was not fair to you.

01:45:41.720 --> 01:45:45.230
And I am so, so sorry.

01:45:46.690 --> 01:45:51.400
And I’m-- I’m being selfish
again by even asking,

01:45:51.400 --> 01:45:52.830
but do you think that--

01:45:52.830 --> 01:45:55.800
that I could stay here
and just...

01:45:58.080 --> 01:45:59.510
just sleep?

01:46:02.680 --> 01:46:04.020
Could you...

01:46:05.710 --> 01:46:08.450
stay with me while I sleep?

01:46:12.030 --> 01:46:13.000
Please.

01:46:14.720 --> 01:46:16.890
Yeah, of course
I’ll stay with you.

01:46:24.930 --> 01:46:26.900
I’ll stay with you forever.

01:46:33.350 --> 01:46:34.510
No.

01:46:41.550 --> 01:46:42.920
No.

01:46:43.990 --> 01:46:45.290
No, no, no, no.

01:46:46.260 --> 01:46:47.360
No, no.

01:47:02.110 --> 01:47:03.280
No.

01:47:27.700 --> 01:47:29.700
            Rose.

01:47:32.770 --> 01:47:35.370
No, no, no!

01:47:43.120 --> 01:47:45.120
Rose!
No.

01:47:45.120 --> 01:47:47.090
Rose, open the door!

01:47:48.980 --> 01:47:52.020
 Open the door.

01:47:53.490 --> 01:47:55.020
Rose!

01:48:05.000 --> 01:48:07.870
No!

01:48:08.640 --> 01:48:11.810
 No!
Fuck. Uh--

01:48:11.810 --> 01:48:13.480
Hold on. I’m coming!

01:48:13.480 --> 01:48:16.090
No!

01:48:19.390 --> 01:48:20.750
Rose!

01:48:23.290 --> 01:48:25.950
No!

01:49:07.400 --> 01:49:08.760
Rose.

01:49:43.030 --> 01:49:44.270
Rose?

01:49:50.540 --> 01:49:51.480
Rose?
