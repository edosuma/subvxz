02:26.413 --> 02:30.315

offers canoeing,

02:30.450 --> 02:32.717
Fishing, tennis?

02:32.753 --> 02:36.521
- Dear lord! I just want to
laze around and put my feet up.

02:36.524 --> 02:39.791
- Yes, which is precisely why
I booked this vacation for us.

02:39.860 --> 02:42.794
A little rest before
the arrival of<i> bébé</i> !

02:42.796 --> 02:45.263
- Well, thank you, william.
I just can't decide

02:45.399 --> 02:47.933
Whether to take all
or none of these books.

02:48.002 --> 02:51.169
- How about a compromise?
Bring two.

02:54.408 --> 02:57.542
"the complete baby book."
it's rather ambitious.

02:58.679 --> 03:00.946
- George bernard shaw highly
recommends it.

03:01.015 --> 03:02.480
- Well, then.
(telephone rings)

03:08.389 --> 03:09.955
Detective william murdoch.

03:10.558 --> 03:11.690
Oh, hello, sir.

03:12.560 --> 03:13.691
Oh.

03:14.562 --> 03:16.628
Yes, I'll be right there.

03:17.831 --> 03:20.966
- William! We have to be
on a train in three hours.

03:21.035 --> 03:23.568
- Y-yes, this won't take long,
I promise.

03:23.637 --> 03:25.069
- Uh... Hmm.

03:25.906 --> 03:28.339
(mysterious music)

03:29.776 --> 03:32.510
- At first glance,
this man was on the losing
side of a fight.

03:33.513 --> 03:36.081
He was stabbed, beaten,
strangled.

03:37.051 --> 03:38.517
(humming): Shot through
the heart,

03:38.652 --> 03:41.186
Drowned in dark liquor...

03:42.990 --> 03:45.657
- Are you trying to tell us
something, detective?

03:45.693 --> 03:48.527
- I heard about this
exact murder, last night.

03:49.363 --> 03:50.695
But in a song.

03:51.398 --> 03:52.797
(dramatic music)

04:00.941 --> 04:02.674
I was at the salon last night

04:02.710 --> 04:05.143
And the performer,
curiously named lead belly--

04:05.179 --> 04:06.812
- Wait, watts. Lead belly?

04:06.947 --> 04:10.015
- Yes, sir. A guitar player
hired to play at my salon.

04:10.017 --> 04:11.350
- What salon?

04:11.352 --> 04:13.218
- It's a new establishment
where patrons

04:13.353 --> 04:15.020
Can listen to contemporary
music.

04:15.022 --> 04:16.754
- Yes. Last night,
he sang a song called

04:16.790 --> 04:18.557
"five ways to kill a man."

04:18.692 --> 04:20.559
- That's the name of a song?
- Hmm.

04:21.629 --> 04:23.294
- Those five ways
were represented here.

04:23.330 --> 04:24.896
- They were indeed.

04:24.898 --> 04:25.797
- Interesting.

04:26.700 --> 04:28.666
- I also found these
on the body.

04:29.570 --> 04:30.702
What are they?

04:30.837 --> 04:32.604
- I have no idea.
- They're reeds.

04:32.739 --> 04:34.706
Once they're added to
the mouthpiece

04:34.775 --> 04:36.575
Of, say, a saxophone
or a clarinet,

04:36.710 --> 04:39.277
They vibrate to create
the horn's unique sound.

04:40.381 --> 04:42.848
- Right. And you saw
this man play last night?

04:44.251 --> 04:47.853
- I believe he was scheduled
to perform, but never arrived.

04:48.989 --> 04:50.722
- If you'll excuse me,
I must get started

04:50.758 --> 04:52.790
On this post-mortem before
he thaws out.

04:52.826 --> 04:54.492
- Ah, yes, thank you, mrs. Hart.

04:54.494 --> 04:56.828
- With me, detective.
I know the way to the salon.

04:56.830 --> 05:00.065
The entrance to
the establishment is a little
tricky to locate,

05:00.134 --> 05:01.666

05:38.839 --> 05:40.171
You're a christian!

05:40.207 --> 05:42.507
- I sang as a child.

05:42.642 --> 05:45.510
Seaview african baptist,
every Sunday morning,

05:45.512 --> 05:46.912
Back home in africville.

05:46.914 --> 05:49.180
- Oh! That's my exact story.

05:49.216 --> 05:51.383
Except it was turner chapel
in oakville.

05:52.453 --> 05:55.753
- Truthfully though,
singing those hymns,

05:56.923 --> 05:58.256
That was my favourite part
of going to church.

05:58.258 --> 05:59.524
- Hmm!

06:01.061 --> 06:03.929
Then, how can you say
what we just sang doesn't
belong in the salon?

06:04.998 --> 06:06.531
- Miss jacobs,
it's not about belonging.

06:06.533 --> 06:08.466
It's about business.
- Hmm.

06:09.536 --> 06:11.936
That rag music that's so popular
right now,

06:11.972 --> 06:13.871
Not for me.
- Oh, no?

06:14.875 --> 06:16.207
So, I won't catch you
in the backroom

06:16.243 --> 06:17.609
Doing a little cakewalk,

06:17.678 --> 06:19.343
Dusting the baseboards?
(laughs)

06:19.380 --> 06:21.146
- Go on, you!
(laughing)

06:23.650 --> 06:26.017
- Pardon the interruption.
Are you the owner?

06:26.019 --> 06:29.220
- Miss cassiopeia bright.
How may I help you gentlemen?

06:29.289 --> 06:30.956
- Detective murdoch,
toronto constabulary.

06:31.091 --> 06:32.924
We'd like to ask you
some questions

06:32.993 --> 06:36.228
About a saxophone player
you recently hired to play here.

06:36.363 --> 06:39.030
- I believe it's this man,
pictured in your flyer?

06:40.234 --> 06:42.767
- That's the horn player
I hired to play this week.

06:42.770 --> 06:43.835
(discordant note)

06:43.837 --> 06:45.437
- Alto sax, correct?

06:45.439 --> 06:46.437
- Yes.

06:46.473 --> 06:47.939
- And did he?

06:47.941 --> 06:49.040
Play here this week?

06:49.977 --> 06:51.843
- He played once
that Monday night.

06:51.978 --> 06:53.077
And then, ran off.

06:53.614 --> 06:54.446
- Ran off?

06:55.649 --> 06:57.449
- After we argued about
paying him in advance,

06:57.584 --> 06:59.717
Eventually I gave in and then,
he didn't show up

06:59.753 --> 07:01.052
To play his second set.

07:01.121 --> 07:03.421
Why, is he in some sort
of trouble?

07:04.425 --> 07:06.057
- He was found murdered
this morning.

07:07.561 --> 07:08.693
- I...

07:09.430 --> 07:11.262
Assumed he left town.

07:13.400 --> 07:15.400
- So, the last time you saw
mister colman,

07:15.535 --> 07:18.135
The two of you argued over money
and he disappeared.

07:18.772 --> 07:19.671
Was he alone?

07:20.641 --> 07:23.007
- He left with
huddie lead belly,

07:23.076 --> 07:24.876
My musical act
from the same night.

07:25.679 --> 07:27.078
- Speak of the devil.

07:27.147 --> 07:28.413
-<i> Chérie</i> !

07:29.349 --> 07:30.781
Why are you calling my name?

07:31.952 --> 07:32.884
- These gentlemen would like
to speak with you.

07:33.753 --> 07:34.619
If you're all done with me,

07:34.621 --> 07:36.888
I have some things
to attend to.

07:37.991 --> 07:39.323
- Mister lead belly,

07:40.427 --> 07:43.461
What is your relationship
to horatio colman?

07:44.398 --> 07:46.564
- Who you call horatio
I call blue.

07:47.234 --> 07:48.700
Well, we go way back.

07:48.769 --> 07:50.635
Travelling,
playing juke joints

07:50.671 --> 07:52.237
And weekend dances all over
the country.

07:53.106 --> 07:55.306
Why? Where he at?

07:56.209 --> 07:57.842
- Well, we regret to
inform you

07:57.911 --> 07:59.777
He was found murdered
this morning.

08:00.413 --> 08:01.780
- Lordy, lordy!

08:01.782 --> 08:03.180
- You were friends?

08:03.217 --> 08:04.749
- More like brothers
and cousins!

08:05.452 --> 08:06.784
- Miss bright stated that

08:06.786 --> 08:09.254
You were the last person to
see him, Monday night.

08:09.256 --> 08:11.523
- Aye, I was here.

08:12.092 --> 08:13.391
Drank some,

08:13.460 --> 08:15.393
Went out on the town,
drank a little more.

08:16.530 --> 08:18.663
And the rest of the night
was a mystery to me.

08:19.633 --> 08:21.132
- I saw you perform
last night,

08:21.168 --> 08:23.201
You sang a remarkable song
called

08:23.270 --> 08:24.936
"five ways to kill a man"?

08:26.540 --> 08:27.806
(humming)

08:28.909 --> 08:32.310
♪ he thief your girl from
out your bed ♪

08:33.813 --> 08:36.213
♪ you have all the rights

08:36.884 --> 08:39.216

08:41.822 --> 08:44.288
When I shook off my slumber,
yesterday morning,

08:44.324 --> 08:45.957
It was in my head,
won't let me go.

08:46.827 --> 08:48.360
Understand something, fellas.

08:49.363 --> 08:50.962
When the muses call,
I surely listen.

08:51.832 --> 08:52.964
I just let it out,
last night.

08:52.966 --> 08:54.366
- Just like that?

08:54.501 --> 08:56.501
- Yeah.
I've been making up songs

08:56.570 --> 08:58.703
Since I was no bigger
than a June bug.

08:58.705 --> 09:01.039
- And were the muses,
as you call them,

09:01.108 --> 09:04.543
Explicit about how to kill
a man five ways?

09:05.879 --> 09:07.778
- It was like a dream
I was coming out of, you know?

09:07.814 --> 09:10.048
Lots of hazy pictures and such.

09:10.117 --> 09:14.385
- Mister lead belly,
how did you get your split lip?

09:15.855 --> 09:17.389
- I don't know, sir.

09:17.391 --> 09:20.258
Truth is, I was drunker
than cooter brown, that night.

09:20.260 --> 09:21.126
Who knows what I did?

09:22.262 --> 09:24.161
- I think you know more than
you're saying.

09:27.834 --> 09:29.801
- The song's called
"five ways to kill a man".

09:29.803 --> 09:31.569
And they're all evidenced
on the body.

09:31.638 --> 09:33.838
- Hmm.
- According to mrs. Hart, yes.

09:33.840 --> 09:36.408
- And this lead belly fellow
wrote the song yesterday
morning?

09:36.543 --> 09:38.810
- Claims muses spoke it to him.

09:38.879 --> 09:40.612
- It's possible the murder
happened

09:40.614 --> 09:42.080
Before he sang the song.

09:43.283 --> 09:44.882
- Then, he dumped the body
before taking the stage.

09:44.918 --> 09:47.251
- In broad daylight?
Seems risky.

09:48.555 --> 09:50.355
- Watts, take this flyer
with the victim's picture on it

09:50.490 --> 09:52.223
And canvass the area where
he was found.

09:52.225 --> 09:54.092
Somebody must have seen him
the night he died.

09:54.094 --> 09:57.428
- Alright. I only wish I'd seen
him perform.

10:01.168 --> 10:02.500
- Something nagging you,
murdoch?

10:04.638 --> 10:07.038
- I find it difficult to believe
that mister belly...

10:07.173 --> 10:08.640
- Mister belly?

10:08.775 --> 10:11.375
- I admit I'm not quite sure
how to address him.

10:11.411 --> 10:12.910
- So, mister belly!

10:12.912 --> 10:13.979
(clears throat)

10:14.114 --> 10:17.782
- Sang a song describing
specifically five different ways

10:17.917 --> 10:20.651
To murder a man in front of
a crowd of 50 people

10:20.687 --> 10:22.787
Who could identify him as
the killer of a man

10:22.789 --> 10:24.789
That was found dead
the next morning.

10:25.592 --> 10:26.424
It doesn't make any sense.

10:27.227 --> 10:28.560
- You said he'd been drinking?

10:28.695 --> 10:31.262
- So much so that he doesn't
know how he got back
to the salon.

10:31.331 --> 10:33.064
- Happens to the best of us.

10:33.133 --> 10:35.299
I'll give you winston churchill.

10:36.870 --> 10:39.370
- Churchill didn't remember
because he didn't kill anyone!

10:40.473 --> 10:41.806
- When you're in the haze
of drink, murdoch,

10:41.941 --> 10:43.074
Anything can happen.

10:43.110 --> 10:45.076
Alcohol can unlock
a part of you

10:45.112 --> 10:46.744
That you never even knew
existed.

10:47.280 --> 10:48.579
(sniffs)

10:48.615 --> 10:50.414
She can be a cruel mistress.

10:52.352 --> 10:53.851
- That gives me an idea.

10:54.621 --> 10:55.820
- Hmm!

10:57.090 --> 10:59.990
My birthing papers back
in louisiana say ledbetter.

11:01.161 --> 11:03.428
But I think "lead belly" has
a nicer sound to it.

11:03.563 --> 11:05.630
- Well, when you work in
the performing arts,

11:05.632 --> 11:07.365
It's good to have a catchy name.
- Hmm-hmm.

11:07.500 --> 11:09.701
- I know it certainly
hasn't hurt me as an author.

11:10.804 --> 11:13.571
- Hold on. You wrote a book?
Get out of here!

11:13.573 --> 11:14.772
- Oh!

11:14.841 --> 11:16.641
- Well, lookie here,
shakespeare.

11:16.776 --> 11:17.775
I duly apologize.

11:17.844 --> 11:19.510
- Listen, I'll give you
this right now,

11:19.546 --> 11:20.845
But first, you have to
tell me something.

11:20.980 --> 11:22.447
- Sure.
- You're from louisiana, right?

11:22.449 --> 11:23.448
- Born and raised.

11:23.583 --> 11:25.650
- So, you know
about the red river?

11:25.785 --> 11:27.719
Have you ever seen
the swamp monster?

11:27.721 --> 11:29.187
- Hmm-hmm.
- The rougarou?

11:29.256 --> 11:30.855
(laughs)

11:30.990 --> 11:32.857
- I sure have, crabtree.
I sure have.

11:32.893 --> 11:35.393
- The bloodsucking creature with
the body of a man

11:35.395 --> 11:36.594
And head of a wolf!
- Hmm-hmm.

11:36.663 --> 11:37.595
- Tell me everything!

11:37.597 --> 11:39.464
- Well, back in the day,
my mama...

11:39.466 --> 11:42.066
- He has no recollection
of what happened that night,

11:42.135 --> 11:43.668
Because he drank to excess.

11:43.803 --> 11:46.004
- Well, it's a possible
case of automatism.

11:46.606 --> 11:47.872
- Automatism?

11:48.007 --> 11:51.276
- It's rare, but in the grips
of profound intoxication,

11:51.411 --> 11:53.010
One can commit heinous acts

11:53.080 --> 11:55.412
And be completely unaware
of what happened.

11:55.449 --> 11:59.017
- I'm hoping that
if you hypnotize him,

11:59.019 --> 12:02.086
He will be able to remember
what happened that night.

12:02.122 --> 12:03.955
- Well, I will just have enough
time to do that

12:04.024 --> 12:06.357
Before we have to leave.
If we miss the train,

12:06.426 --> 12:08.559
Then the carriage to the hotel
will not wait for us!

12:08.628 --> 12:10.895
- Yes, yes. Mister belly.

12:10.964 --> 12:12.563
- Just call me lead belly.

12:12.599 --> 12:14.432
- Mister lead belly.
- Hmm-hmm.

12:14.501 --> 12:16.033
- This is doctor julia ogden.

12:16.069 --> 12:19.170
She would like to hypnotize you
in the hopes of unlocking

12:19.305 --> 12:21.038
Your memories of Monday night.

12:21.074 --> 12:23.174
- Hold on, now. Hypnotism?

12:23.243 --> 12:25.576
That sounds like some
louisiana hoodoo to me.

12:26.646 --> 12:28.445
- Well, I assure you,
it's perfectly safe

12:28.482 --> 12:29.914
And it should only take
a few minutes.

12:30.584 --> 12:31.582
- Hmm-hmm.

12:31.618 --> 12:33.284
- It's that or a night
in our cells.

12:33.286 --> 12:34.586
The choice is yours.

12:37.323 --> 12:39.456
(mysterious music)

12:40.727 --> 12:42.893
- And when you step out
of the salon, what do you see?

12:43.463 --> 12:44.829
- It's nighttime.

12:45.398 --> 12:46.764
And there's snow,

12:47.801 --> 12:49.200
Like little stars falling
to the ground.

12:49.335 --> 12:51.001
- And where did you go next?

12:52.773 --> 12:54.939
- I don't know.

12:56.309 --> 12:58.409
- Place yourself back in
that evening.

12:59.746 --> 13:01.212
Does anything come to you?

13:01.347 --> 13:02.580
(woman laughing)

13:02.616 --> 13:03.648
- A lady.

13:04.351 --> 13:05.683
- What kind of lady?

13:05.719 --> 13:07.518
- She's a lady in the brown
bottle.

13:08.688 --> 13:10.421
(whispered): Lady in the brown
bottle?

13:10.423 --> 13:12.557
- And there's a bloody rainbow.

13:12.559 --> 13:14.491
(mysterious music)

13:15.528 --> 13:18.096
- Is the lady injured?
Is horatio there?

13:18.231 --> 13:19.496
- I see a dog.

13:19.533 --> 13:21.465
- What kind of dog?

13:21.501 --> 13:23.701
- The craziest dog I ever
did see.

13:23.837 --> 13:25.570
A black dog with three heads.

13:25.639 --> 13:26.637
Ooh!

13:27.440 --> 13:29.240
Lordy, this country's cold.

13:30.210 --> 13:31.776
- What else?
What else do you see?

13:31.911 --> 13:33.077
- I don't know.

13:33.146 --> 13:34.712
Ooh, whee!

13:34.781 --> 13:37.414
- I think that's all we're going
to get out of him for now.

13:39.386 --> 13:41.986
- Bloody rainbow,
lady in the brown bottle,

13:42.022 --> 13:43.521
Three-headed dog? What?

13:43.656 --> 13:45.256
- Cerberus, sir.
- Cerber, sir?

13:45.391 --> 13:46.724
- Sir, cerberus!

13:46.726 --> 13:48.593
Sir, cerberus.

13:48.595 --> 13:50.428
The three-headed dog
of the underworld.

13:50.563 --> 13:52.163
- Well, there's something
there,

13:52.165 --> 13:53.865
But I couldn't quite unlock it.

13:54.000 --> 13:55.799
He remembers
the evening in question,

13:55.836 --> 13:57.001
But just no details.

13:57.037 --> 13:58.937
- So, he wasn't completely
drunk?

13:59.072 --> 14:00.738
- Well, yes and no.

14:00.807 --> 14:01.739
- How do you mean, doctor?

14:02.909 --> 14:04.075
- Well, I think we all know
what it feels like

14:04.144 --> 14:06.077
To have one too many drinks
before bed.

14:07.147 --> 14:08.279
(sighs)

14:08.281 --> 14:10.547
You may not remember
the entire evening,

14:10.584 --> 14:12.617
But there are snatches
of images floating

14:12.619 --> 14:13.885
In your memory the next day.

14:13.954 --> 14:16.087
- Then, there are times where
you don't remember anything

14:16.089 --> 14:17.755
From the night at all.
That's never good.

14:19.092 --> 14:20.925
- Well, luckily, he does recall
some of that night.

14:21.060 --> 14:22.293
- So, what do we do now?

14:22.428 --> 14:24.595
- Well, we need to leave
for our trip,

14:24.631 --> 14:27.498
But I think if you retraced
his steps from that evening,

14:27.500 --> 14:29.099
The answer may present itself.

14:29.135 --> 14:30.868
I'll wait for you at the door.

14:32.806 --> 14:34.372
- He either killed the man
himself

14:34.374 --> 14:35.773
Or he witnessed it.

14:36.743 --> 14:40.177
- Sir, perhaps
if you accompanied

14:40.213 --> 14:43.180
Mister lead belly
as he retraced his steps

14:43.216 --> 14:45.183
Through toronto
that night,

14:45.318 --> 14:47.551
You might help him
to remember.

14:48.655 --> 14:50.121
- So, you're saying
the best chance we have

14:50.256 --> 14:51.656
Is to take the fellow out
drinking.

14:52.726 --> 14:55.359
- I'm saying that
you should accompany him.

14:56.463 --> 14:57.929
You don't necessarily need
to drink yourself.

14:57.931 --> 15:00.664
- Ah, murdoch, vino veritas.

15:00.700 --> 15:02.333
It's always
served me well before,

15:02.335 --> 15:04.802
There's no reason to think that
it won't serve me well tonight.

15:04.871 --> 15:05.970
Enjoy your trip.

15:06.873 --> 15:07.605
(sighs)

15:10.944 --> 15:13.277
Right, bugalugs:
Go and grab the musician,

15:13.280 --> 15:14.612
And get your civvies on.

15:14.614 --> 15:17.682
We have got
some investigating to do!

15:17.817 --> 15:19.350
- Sir, excellent!

15:20.553 --> 15:23.354
- Sometimes, this job
has unforeseen benefits.

15:24.357 --> 15:25.789
(laughs)

15:31.164 --> 15:32.430
(soft music)

15:33.667 --> 15:35.299
- We're going to miss
the dinner service.

15:35.335 --> 15:39.503
- Oh, I'm quite certain
we'll be there in time.

15:39.539 --> 15:41.205
- I'm getting hungry!

15:43.643 --> 15:45.643
- Perhaps they'll serve us
supper in our rooms.

15:45.778 --> 15:47.045
- Well, I hope so!

15:47.180 --> 15:48.379
- We'll be fine.

15:48.949 --> 15:49.847
(driver): Whoa!

15:49.916 --> 15:50.848
(horse neighs)

15:50.884 --> 15:52.049
- Oh, no!

15:52.953 --> 15:54.185
William, this can't be
happening!

15:54.254 --> 15:55.453
- I... Oh!

15:55.522 --> 15:56.988
(sighs)

15:57.123 --> 15:58.589
(dramatic music)

15:58.658 --> 16:01.592
- I am so sorry about that,
mr. And mrs.

16:01.594 --> 16:04.729
I got a broken wheel
and no supplies to fix it.

16:04.731 --> 16:05.996
So, sit tight,

16:06.032 --> 16:08.599
And I'll be back as soon as
I can with some help.

16:08.735 --> 16:10.935
- Wait, wait, wait.
You're just going to leave us?

16:11.070 --> 16:12.136
It's freezing!

16:12.172 --> 16:14.939
- Well, it's been colder,
but I'll tell you what.

16:15.008 --> 16:17.408
There's a cabin I use
down the road.

16:18.044 --> 16:19.477
It's no xanadu,

16:19.479 --> 16:21.812
But I have been known
to pen a few ditties in there.

16:22.549 --> 16:23.547
- Ditties?

16:24.718 --> 16:26.417
- Well, I have written
a song or two in my time.

16:26.419 --> 16:27.485
- Right.

16:27.554 --> 16:29.753
Well, thank you, mister...

16:29.789 --> 16:31.956
- Sawyer. Thomas sawyer.

16:32.559 --> 16:33.624
I'll be back.

16:38.131 --> 16:39.730
- So, have you seen this man
before?

16:39.799 --> 16:42.566
- Sure have. He'd never had
a pretzel before!

16:42.602 --> 16:44.234
Liked them so much
he bought two.

16:44.270 --> 16:46.437
(chuckles)
- and this was two nights ago?

16:46.473 --> 16:47.638
- Indeed.

16:48.842 --> 16:50.574
Well, he started crowing about
having heaps of cash

16:50.643 --> 16:52.243
Burning a hole in his pocket.

16:52.312 --> 16:54.445
So, I set him in the direction
of the tipsy ferret.

16:54.580 --> 16:55.712
(chuckling)

16:55.749 --> 16:57.849
- As good a place as any
to part a man from his money.

16:57.984 --> 16:59.517
- Don't I know it!
- Thank you.

17:00.186 --> 17:01.318
Come on, you two.

17:01.320 --> 17:02.186
- Ooh!

17:05.759 --> 17:07.858
- Excuse me, did you see
this man, last night?

17:07.894 --> 17:08.859
- Hmm-hmm.

17:10.030 --> 17:12.596
- Well, this is not the evening
I had in mind.

17:13.332 --> 17:14.265
What's all this?

17:14.400 --> 17:15.533
- Unlike an artist,

17:15.535 --> 17:17.135
Detectives don't get to set
their own hours.

17:17.270 --> 17:19.403
Have you seen this man
last night?

17:21.641 --> 17:23.474
Feel free to make other plans.

17:23.543 --> 17:25.810
I'm sure that the gentleman
you went on that trip with

17:25.812 --> 17:27.011
Would love to see you.

17:27.013 --> 17:28.946
- You're right, byron would.

17:29.949 --> 17:31.749
But I'll be seeing him tomorrow.
- Byron.

17:32.786 --> 17:34.918
- I have a lot of friends,
llewellyn.

17:35.822 --> 17:37.955
Variety is the very spice
of life

17:37.957 --> 17:39.756
That gives it all its flavour.

17:40.860 --> 17:43.060
- You think you can win me
over with poetry?

17:43.063 --> 17:44.429
- I did it before.

17:45.365 --> 17:46.663
Oh, come on.

17:47.433 --> 17:50.033
I am here, we're together.

17:51.905 --> 17:53.504
Let me help you with your case.

17:56.109 --> 17:58.775
- Remember the horn player
that didn't show up last night?

17:58.812 --> 18:00.845
- Hmm-hmm.
- Turns out he was murdered

18:00.914 --> 18:02.513
In the same way as that song
we heard.

18:02.582 --> 18:03.714
- Oh, god.

18:03.750 --> 18:05.716
- I need to find someone
who saw him before he died.

18:05.718 --> 18:07.018
- Exciting!
- Hmm.

18:08.788 --> 18:09.987
<i> - Salud!</i>

18:10.056 --> 18:11.054
- Right.

18:11.624 --> 18:12.890
- Hmm!
- Hmm!

18:12.892 --> 18:14.358
- Ah, yes. That's it.

18:15.261 --> 18:17.394
- Alright, okay,
now we're talking.

18:17.464 --> 18:18.529
- Oy, what's that?

18:19.699 --> 18:22.232
- I don't care for the taste
of suds, too bitter.

18:23.536 --> 18:24.869
Which is why I always carry
a little bit of sugar on me

18:24.871 --> 18:26.069
To sweeten it up.

18:26.106 --> 18:28.705
- Sugar!
Maybe you are a murderer.

18:29.676 --> 18:31.008
You just murdered a bloody
good pint!

18:31.010 --> 18:32.610
(laughs)
oy, charlie,

18:32.745 --> 18:34.412
Did he pull a stunt like that
the other night?

18:34.547 --> 18:36.380
- Nothing that bad, no.

18:36.416 --> 18:39.149
He was too good to drink
out of an open whiskey bottle.

18:39.185 --> 18:40.751
He demanded I open a brand
new one.

18:40.820 --> 18:43.888
- I don't drink liquor from
a bottle with a broken seal.

18:43.890 --> 18:45.556
I ain't looking to be poisoned!
(laughs)

18:45.592 --> 18:48.292
- So, I crack open a new bottle
for his majesty here,

18:48.328 --> 18:50.495
He takes no time making short
work of it,

18:50.630 --> 18:52.096
Then when it comes time
to pay up,

18:52.231 --> 18:54.165
There's a whole song and dance
about robbed.

18:54.300 --> 18:57.501
- I never stiffed a barman
in my life.

18:57.504 --> 19:00.738
You call me a liar and
I'm fixing to jerk a knot
in your tail.

19:00.740 --> 19:02.573
- Alright, easy, easy.
Then, what happened?

19:02.642 --> 19:04.441
- I threw him out the back door.

19:04.477 --> 19:06.977
All the while, he's kicking up
quite a fuss.

19:08.247 --> 19:10.113
- Alright, thank you.
Let's go take a look out back.

19:10.150 --> 19:12.216
- Hold on a second,
I still expect to be paid.

19:13.586 --> 19:15.586
He left quite a tab, I will not
be put on the hook for it.

19:15.622 --> 19:17.254
- Well, well, well. Lookie here.

19:18.491 --> 19:19.991
Praise marie laveau!

19:20.126 --> 19:21.792
- Wait a minute, sir.

19:22.795 --> 19:23.861
Look.

19:23.863 --> 19:26.463
- Charity.
That could be evidence.

19:28.635 --> 19:30.401
- Didn't pay my...
You better watch yourself.

19:30.403 --> 19:31.936
- That should cover it, charlie.

19:32.405 --> 19:33.337
(sighs)

19:34.641 --> 19:36.340
Oh, what a waste.

19:37.043 --> 19:39.610
(intriguing music)

19:43.183 --> 19:44.081
- Sir!

19:46.519 --> 19:47.951
This must be it.

19:47.987 --> 19:49.420
- This is what, crabtree?

19:49.422 --> 19:50.688
- Cerberus.

19:51.624 --> 19:53.023
The three-headed dog.

19:54.760 --> 19:56.159
Shall we?

20:00.567 --> 20:01.498
Hello?

20:01.534 --> 20:02.667
Hello?

20:06.239 --> 20:07.504
(chuckles)

20:07.540 --> 20:09.806
- I knew you'd be back,
aquarius man.

20:10.910 --> 20:13.144
You still have that protection
I gave you?

20:13.146 --> 20:15.245
- Is that what that is?
- Hmm-hmm!

20:15.281 --> 20:18.448
- I suppose that proves
you were here, but... When?

20:19.252 --> 20:20.651
- Close to the witching hour.

20:20.720 --> 20:23.721
I remember, 'cause I could feel
the magic coming off of him

20:23.856 --> 20:25.322
Soon as he came through
that door.

20:25.458 --> 20:26.890
- What time is
the witching hour?

20:26.926 --> 20:28.392
- About 3 am, sir.

20:29.362 --> 20:31.529
(mysterious music)

20:31.664 --> 20:32.930
(distant ruckus)

20:32.999 --> 20:35.466
- The neighbours are always up
to some nonsense,

20:35.601 --> 20:38.002
Keeping me awake
with their parties!

20:38.071 --> 20:40.137
- She knows we're coppers.
Come on, lads, this way!

20:40.806 --> 20:43.040
(dramatic music)

20:43.042 --> 20:44.342
(shouting)
- go!

20:47.747 --> 20:49.013
- What is this place?

20:49.082 --> 20:51.215
- Take a wild guess, crabtree.

20:51.217 --> 20:54.551
Cards! Chips!
It's a gambling den!

20:55.555 --> 20:58.022
Oy! We can see you.
Stand up.

20:58.625 --> 20:59.823
(sighs)

21:00.593 --> 21:01.958
Do you recognize this man?

21:01.995 --> 21:03.960
- Uh... Yes.
(chuckles)

21:03.997 --> 21:06.230
A winner, a few nights ago.

21:06.299 --> 21:09.367
As soon as he walked in, a fan
gave him a dollar to gamble

21:09.369 --> 21:11.535
When I refused to take his ring
as collateral.

21:12.538 --> 21:13.904
Said he was some kind
of musician.

21:13.973 --> 21:15.239
(laughs)
- alright, alright.

21:15.374 --> 21:17.174
So, he was here and he did well.
What happened next?

21:17.243 --> 21:21.445
- Uh, he was winning big,
singing songs.

21:21.580 --> 21:22.913
The customers loved it.

21:24.183 --> 21:26.183
But then, he stopped as soon
as another man walked in,

21:26.252 --> 21:27.251
Later that night.

21:29.589 --> 21:30.654
- Was it this man?

21:31.123 --> 21:32.323
- Yes.

21:32.325 --> 21:34.325
Yes, as soon as
the winning man saw him,

21:34.460 --> 21:35.326
He started screaming!

21:36.128 --> 21:37.661
- Screaming what, exactly?

21:38.865 --> 21:41.666
- Uh... "you stole my money!"
he kept screaming.

21:41.801 --> 21:43.734
And picked up a bottle
to fight him.

21:45.104 --> 21:47.104
He drained it first, which
I appreciated, since liquor...

21:47.106 --> 21:49.106
(laughs)
...Is not cheap.

21:49.108 --> 21:50.540
- My kind of fellow.

21:50.576 --> 21:51.742
- What did you do?

21:51.877 --> 21:55.946
- So, I say, "out!" I say,
"you want to curse, go on.

21:56.015 --> 21:58.816
But no fighting!
Take it outside!"

21:58.818 --> 22:00.017
- Through there?

22:00.019 --> 22:01.152
- Yes.

22:02.088 --> 22:03.653
- Don't go anywhere.

22:05.191 --> 22:07.491
(mysterious music)

22:08.661 --> 22:11.295
- None of this is ringing
any bells to me at all.

22:11.430 --> 22:13.230
- Sir, look at this.

22:15.101 --> 22:16.767
Could be dried blood,
could be dirt.

22:16.803 --> 22:18.001
It's too dark to see.

22:19.072 --> 22:20.837
- So, you're out on the town,

22:20.873 --> 22:22.806
Having a good time,
having a few drinks.

22:23.843 --> 22:24.775
At some point, you reach
for your wallet

22:24.910 --> 22:26.910
And you realize
it's been pinched.

22:26.979 --> 22:28.712
- That's when
your buddy walks in,

22:28.781 --> 22:30.648
You figure he's the one
who stole it.

22:30.783 --> 22:33.250
- But this, this makes you
see red.

22:34.320 --> 22:35.452
And you've got one hell
of a temper.

22:36.689 --> 22:38.389
Now, the two of you step outside
to settle it like men,

22:38.391 --> 22:40.124
But your pal, blue,

22:40.193 --> 22:41.725
He's not in his cups
as much as you

22:41.761 --> 22:43.326
And he catches you a good one.

22:43.363 --> 22:45.262
- It would explain
the split lip.

22:45.298 --> 22:47.798
- But you,
you're the type of fella

22:47.800 --> 22:49.333
Who gives as good as he gets.

22:49.468 --> 22:51.935
You crack him one to the jaw and
before he can poke you back,

22:51.971 --> 22:54.338
You hit him with this bottle,
killing him.

22:54.340 --> 22:56.407
Fight over, dead friend.

22:57.310 --> 22:58.542
- It does add up.

22:59.879 --> 23:02.078
- No, I... I don't think that's
what happened at all.

23:02.115 --> 23:03.680
- How can you be sure?

23:03.716 --> 23:06.216
When you were hypnotized,
you mentioned a brown bottle.

23:06.986 --> 23:07.818
- Well...
(metal clanking)

23:07.953 --> 23:09.019
(gasping)

23:09.055 --> 23:10.154
- Catch him, go on!

23:11.090 --> 23:12.756
Get after him!
Come on, crabtree!

23:12.759 --> 23:15.225
- Stop! Lead belly! Stop!

23:15.294 --> 23:16.560
(gasping)

23:17.163 --> 23:18.362
- Lead belly!

23:18.364 --> 23:19.964
- Crabtree,
get the cuffs on him!

23:21.100 --> 23:22.900
- Wait, wait, wait!
I've been here before.

23:23.536 --> 23:24.668
- Sure, you have.

23:24.704 --> 23:26.237
- I swear on my mama's life.

23:26.372 --> 23:28.772
I've been at this here building
two nights ago.

23:28.841 --> 23:31.575
Now, if I'm lying, lock me up.

23:32.378 --> 23:35.412
But this building, I know it.

23:36.182 --> 23:38.381
- Sir, we're already here.

23:38.418 --> 23:39.917
Can't hurt to take a look.

23:39.919 --> 23:42.052
- Alright. Well, you're keeping
an eye on him.

23:42.088 --> 23:43.120
Come on.

23:44.457 --> 23:46.122
(soft music)

23:46.159 --> 23:47.390
- Yeah, that's me.

23:47.960 --> 23:49.326
I'm charity.

23:49.328 --> 23:52.062
- Ah, now, do you remember
keeping company

23:52.131 --> 23:53.430
With this gentleman
over here?

23:54.467 --> 23:55.599
- Patched his lip up with
a little honey

23:55.734 --> 23:57.535
And we had some fun.
- Ah!

23:57.537 --> 23:59.136
- Felt like florence
nightingale.

23:59.271 --> 24:01.205
- Well, thanks for that, miss.

24:02.308 --> 24:04.575
- And when he arrived,
how was he looking?

24:04.710 --> 24:06.076
Was he covered in blood
at all?

24:06.212 --> 24:08.345
- Hmm, no. A little rumpled,

24:08.414 --> 24:10.413
But that's to be expected
at that time of night.

24:11.184 --> 24:12.516
- About what time was that?

24:12.552 --> 24:14.284
- Somewhere around 4:30.

24:14.320 --> 24:16.320
He said he won some money
playing craps

24:16.322 --> 24:18.788
And couldn't wait
to spend it on me.

24:19.892 --> 24:21.692
- Then, afterwards,
you scrawled your name

24:21.761 --> 24:23.494
On this four-dollar bill
instead of keeping it.

24:23.563 --> 24:24.962
Why?
- Well,

24:25.031 --> 24:26.830
He stayed until eight
in the morning

24:26.866 --> 24:28.598
And paid me handsomely for it.

24:29.869 --> 24:32.036
I knew he probably
wouldn't remember my name,

24:32.171 --> 24:33.504
Sauced as he was.

24:34.640 --> 24:37.641
Besides, everyone deserves
a little charity.

24:38.444 --> 24:39.910
- Well, thank you for your help.

24:40.813 --> 24:42.512
We'll let you get back
to your...

24:42.548 --> 24:43.714
Customers.
- Hmm!

24:43.783 --> 24:44.848
- Ma'am.

24:47.353 --> 24:48.919
- Have a pleasant evening.

24:48.955 --> 24:51.188
- Thank you, inspector and...

24:52.225 --> 24:54.424
Feel free to swing by
anytime you want.

24:55.495 --> 24:57.995
- Sir! Shall we?
- Oh, yes.

24:58.664 --> 25:00.531
(soft music)

25:05.805 --> 25:07.671
(sighs)
- now, come on.

25:07.673 --> 25:10.341
You think I escaped being gator
bait in lousiana

25:10.343 --> 25:12.743
To swing in white man's heaven
for killing someone?

25:12.812 --> 25:14.478
It just don't make no sense.

25:14.613 --> 25:16.747
- You may have received
charity at that cathouse,

25:16.816 --> 25:19.683
But that largesse doesn't
extend to station house four.

25:19.818 --> 25:20.817
- Listen.

25:20.887 --> 25:23.353
Some of us hit the dirt quicker
than others.

25:23.389 --> 25:25.022
But I had nothing to do

25:25.091 --> 25:26.957
With putting blue
in touch with his maker.

25:26.959 --> 25:28.825
I'm a musician,
I'm not a killer!

25:28.861 --> 25:31.161
- Look, we figured out the clue
about the three-headed dog

25:31.163 --> 25:32.629
With a visit
to the tarot reader,

25:32.665 --> 25:34.431
So that memory panned out.

25:35.701 --> 25:37.000
- We still don't have anything
on the bloody rainbow

25:37.036 --> 25:38.768
Or the lady in the brown bottle.

25:39.572 --> 25:40.704
Have you anything else for us?

25:41.440 --> 25:43.307
- I don't. I'm sorry.

25:43.376 --> 25:44.375
- So am I.

25:45.478 --> 25:47.311
With no evidence,
we can't exonerate you.

25:48.314 --> 25:49.846
I'm afraid it's off
to the cells.

25:49.882 --> 25:51.214
Take him away, crabtree.

25:51.751 --> 25:53.183
- Wait, hold on.

25:53.252 --> 25:55.052
Crabtree, I didn't kill nobody!

25:55.121 --> 25:56.853
- I know.
- This makes no sense.

25:56.923 --> 25:58.254
We gotta go back out there,
there's something.

25:59.025 --> 26:00.390
(blows)

26:01.160 --> 26:02.526
- There. That should help.

26:02.661 --> 26:03.994
- Thank you, william.

26:04.730 --> 26:05.663
Oh!

26:06.498 --> 26:07.631
Oh!

26:07.633 --> 26:08.699
- Julia?

26:08.768 --> 26:09.833
(sighs)

26:09.869 --> 26:12.202
- Ooh, they're coming faster,
william.

26:13.306 --> 26:14.672
- Right, we need to get you
out of here.

26:14.807 --> 26:15.872
(exhales deeply)

26:15.908 --> 26:17.341
There's still a horse with
the carriage,

26:17.410 --> 26:18.876
I could unhitch it and ride
to the nearest...

26:19.011 --> 26:20.344
(exclaims in protest)

26:20.346 --> 26:23.881
- What? No! You're not going
anywhere...

26:23.883 --> 26:24.948
Ow!

26:26.085 --> 26:27.818
- Based on my analysis
of his stomach contents,

26:27.887 --> 26:29.620
He died around 7,
Tuesday morning.

26:30.756 --> 26:32.155
There's a laceration
from blunt force trauma

26:32.191 --> 26:33.356
To the back of the head.

26:34.493 --> 26:36.160
The blow broke a bone
in the base of the skull,

26:36.162 --> 26:37.828
Which resulted in spinal fluid

26:37.830 --> 26:39.496
And blood leaking from
his nasal cavity.

26:40.533 --> 26:41.831
- He looked like
he'd been in a fight.

26:41.867 --> 26:43.634
- Yes. Blackened eyes and
bloody nose

26:43.769 --> 26:46.169
Are a result of the spinal cord
being damaged from the blow.

26:46.205 --> 26:48.305
- Good lord!
- And after he was struck,

26:48.307 --> 26:49.506
He stopped breathing.

26:49.508 --> 26:51.007
Starving his brain of oxygen.

26:52.178 --> 26:53.410
He might have been dead before
he hit the ground.

26:53.412 --> 26:54.711
- Poor bugger.

26:55.948 --> 26:57.814
I thought you believed
he died later, Tuesday night.

26:59.051 --> 27:01.585
- I did. However, he was found
in an alley on his back.

27:01.720 --> 27:04.054
But when I went to establish
fixed lividity,

27:04.189 --> 27:06.657
The blood had pooled on
the anterior side of his body.

27:07.660 --> 27:09.326
- So, he was struck,
fell forward,

27:09.328 --> 27:11.862
Died and the blood pooled
right here.

27:13.099 --> 27:14.664
He was killed somewhere and
dumped in the alley.

27:14.700 --> 27:16.266
- Lividity doesn't lie.

27:17.269 --> 27:18.936
- So, lead belly was telling
the truth.

27:20.072 --> 27:21.672
Because he was still donating
to charity

27:21.807 --> 27:23.339
When the sun was coming up.

27:23.376 --> 27:25.075
- Well, sir, I don't think it
was a donation,

27:25.111 --> 27:26.210
I think they were...

27:26.345 --> 27:27.745
Oh, yes, of course!
(chuckles)

27:27.747 --> 27:28.745
(door closes)

27:28.881 --> 27:30.414
Well, then, I suppose
the question is,

27:30.549 --> 27:32.149
Where was horatio that morning?

27:32.218 --> 27:35.285
- I found someone to identify
horatio

27:35.287 --> 27:37.621
And you'll never guess
where he went and when.

27:38.758 --> 27:40.090
- Well, don't leave us
in suspense, watts.

27:41.226 --> 27:43.694
- The individual who delivers
papers every day

27:43.696 --> 27:45.696
At the exact same time
on the same route

27:45.831 --> 27:47.965
Remembers seeing horatio
very much alive

27:47.967 --> 27:50.100
Around 5 am Tuesday morning.

27:50.235 --> 27:51.468
- Where was he headed?

27:51.504 --> 27:53.036
- Back to the salon.

27:53.105 --> 27:54.238
- Ah.

27:54.373 --> 27:56.440
Looks like we need to have
a chat with miss bright.

27:57.176 --> 27:58.108
Thank you, mrs. Hart.

28:00.513 --> 28:01.678
(sighs)

28:02.648 --> 28:04.380
- Well, it's not
the imperial muskoka,

28:04.417 --> 28:06.316
But it should do nicely.

28:07.119 --> 28:08.284
- Well, at least it's warm.

28:08.988 --> 28:10.653
Oh...
(groans in pain)

28:11.123 --> 28:12.188
- Oh...

28:14.193 --> 28:15.726
Does it... Hurt?

28:17.996 --> 28:19.563
- William, I've been shot
three times,

28:19.632 --> 28:22.132
Had rabies,
been buried alive.

28:22.168 --> 28:23.399
This is much worse.

28:24.103 --> 28:26.035
(pants)

28:27.339 --> 28:28.639
(sighs)

28:28.774 --> 28:31.908
Luckily, I'm with the smartest,
most capable man in the country.

28:34.714 --> 28:36.947
I'm going to guide you
through the steps

28:37.016 --> 28:38.749
To delivering our baby.

28:40.619 --> 28:42.619
- Are you sure that's wise?

28:43.322 --> 28:44.454
- Don't worry, william.

28:45.124 --> 28:46.589
I'm a doctor, after all.

28:47.826 --> 28:48.826
Oh!

28:48.828 --> 28:50.426
(groaning in pain)

28:50.863 --> 28:52.328
(panting)

28:54.400 --> 28:56.834
(soft music)

28:58.504 --> 28:59.436
- Sir!

29:00.806 --> 29:02.071
Look at this.

29:03.776 --> 29:04.874
- I'll be damned.

29:05.811 --> 29:07.111
It's a bloody rainbow.

29:10.483 --> 29:14.051
This... Is where horatio met
his maker.

29:20.593 --> 29:22.192
- It's definitely blood.

29:25.231 --> 29:26.996
- Inspector brackenreid!

29:27.032 --> 29:28.565
- Good morning, miss bright.

29:29.268 --> 29:30.667
- Thank you, miss jacobs.

29:30.803 --> 29:32.002
You can take a little break,
now.

29:32.071 --> 29:33.137
(chuckles)

29:34.206 --> 29:35.939
What in heavens are you doing
here?

29:37.142 --> 29:39.576
- I'm afraid your musician
was killed right here.

29:41.079 --> 29:42.479
- That's preposterous.

29:42.548 --> 29:43.913
- Really?

29:45.618 --> 29:46.750
(sniffs)

29:46.885 --> 29:49.553
The smell of cordite coming off
this gun says otherwise.

29:49.622 --> 29:51.755
- I've never even fired it.
- Look.

29:52.625 --> 29:54.424
It's missing a bullet.

29:54.460 --> 29:56.293
How do you explain that,
miss bright?

29:56.295 --> 29:58.295
(dramatic music)

30:02.268 --> 30:03.767
- It's a match.

30:03.769 --> 30:05.635
We pulled this out of horatio's
body.

30:06.705 --> 30:08.938
And your explanation
isn't holding any water.

30:10.209 --> 30:12.909
- I've never even pointed
that gun at anyone.

30:13.645 --> 30:14.778
- Hmm.

30:14.913 --> 30:18.448
Maybe horatio turned up
at your salon,

30:18.584 --> 30:19.983
Having had a few too many.

30:21.353 --> 30:23.453
He's still mad
about the argument that
you had over money

30:23.522 --> 30:25.121
And you're not too pleased
that he ran off

30:25.157 --> 30:26.656
Without fulfilling his contract.

30:27.726 --> 30:29.993
Now, just maybe
he gets a little fresh,

30:30.062 --> 30:31.794
'cause he's still quite sozzled.

30:31.831 --> 30:32.929
But you...

30:33.966 --> 30:35.298
Hit him over the head with
a liquor bottle.

30:36.602 --> 30:38.568
And just for good measure,
you put a bullet in him as well.

30:39.204 --> 30:40.337
- Over money?

30:41.173 --> 30:42.606
Over some missed performance?

30:42.741 --> 30:45.209
No, inspector, I am telling you
the truth when I say

30:45.344 --> 30:46.877
I did not see that man again

30:46.879 --> 30:48.745
After exchanging words
Monday night.

30:49.815 --> 30:51.415
You must believe me.

30:51.417 --> 30:53.283
Unfortunately for you,
miss bright,

30:53.418 --> 30:55.085
I believe in evidence.

30:55.087 --> 30:57.654
There's blood in your salon,
the bullet matches your gun

30:57.656 --> 30:58.988
And the timeline fits.

31:00.259 --> 31:01.692
Miss bright.

31:01.827 --> 31:03.159
I hate to do this,

31:03.229 --> 31:05.828
But I'm arresting you for
the murder of horatio colman.

31:06.498 --> 31:07.964
Constable!
- Wait...

31:08.834 --> 31:10.167
- Take her to the cells.
- Wait!

31:14.573 --> 31:16.239
- We do have another suspect,

31:16.308 --> 31:17.975
But to be on the safe side,

31:18.110 --> 31:19.643
You should stay in toronto
for now.

31:19.645 --> 31:20.877
- Oh, whee!

31:21.580 --> 31:22.979
I don't know, crabtree.

31:23.115 --> 31:24.648
Before I came in your country,

31:24.783 --> 31:27.016
I heard this place is called
"toronto the good".

31:27.920 --> 31:29.185
Ain't been no good for me
so far.

31:29.187 --> 31:31.321
- Well, the inspector
is exercising a great deal

31:31.456 --> 31:33.723
Of caution right now.
By the way...

31:34.927 --> 31:36.059
I brought you this.

31:36.128 --> 31:37.460
(laughs)

31:37.496 --> 31:39.128
- Oh, whee! Stella!

31:39.164 --> 31:40.563
Oh, you're looking great.

31:42.134 --> 31:44.134
- Now that I've completed
a full post-mortem,

31:44.203 --> 31:47.003
I have a clearer picture of
what happened to horatio colman.

31:47.139 --> 31:48.739
- Well, carry on, mrs. Hart.

31:48.741 --> 31:50.674
- In spite of the stab wound
to his chest,

31:50.676 --> 31:51.875
There was no blood in his lungs.

31:51.944 --> 31:54.478
And while he smelled strongly
of whiskey,

31:54.480 --> 31:56.146
It appeared to have been poured
in his mouth,

31:56.215 --> 31:57.547
But never swallowed.

31:57.683 --> 31:59.282
- And the ligatures around
the neck?

31:59.285 --> 32:00.951
- Applied after the blow.

32:01.086 --> 32:03.253
If you look here,
the skin is rubbed raw,

32:03.322 --> 32:04.788
But there's no blood present.

32:04.790 --> 32:06.589
- Because he was already dead.

32:06.659 --> 32:09.058
- For several hours or more,
I'd hazard.

32:10.162 --> 32:12.763
- This man was long dead before
he was shot,

32:12.765 --> 32:14.898
Stabbed, choked or drowned
in liquor.

32:15.033 --> 32:16.667
(fingers snap)
- as the song says.

32:17.403 --> 32:19.569
- So, whoever killed him

32:19.638 --> 32:22.772
Hid the body until
they could dump him under
cover of darkness?

32:23.509 --> 32:24.874
- In the meantime,

32:25.811 --> 32:27.176
They heard
"five ways to kill a man"

32:27.212 --> 32:28.245
And used the four other ways

32:28.380 --> 32:30.380
To redirect attention
to the singer.

32:30.382 --> 32:32.115
- Lead belly was being set up.

32:33.185 --> 32:33.984
- Right.

32:34.119 --> 32:35.252
Mrs. Hart.

32:36.321 --> 32:38.554
(intriguing music)

32:42.461 --> 32:43.393
Miss bright.

32:44.830 --> 32:47.330
Now, where were you between 8 pm
and midnight on Tuesday evening?

32:47.399 --> 32:48.598
- My salon.

32:49.935 --> 32:52.803
I was at the show, we watched
lead belly perform at 10...

32:53.973 --> 32:56.006
And then ezra and I went back
to his place.

32:57.209 --> 32:58.941
- And you left the salon
directly after this show?

32:59.912 --> 33:02.546
- We stayed to close up.
See patrons off.

33:02.681 --> 33:05.448
And we left at around midnight.

33:06.385 --> 33:07.583
- And you were together
all night?

33:10.189 --> 33:12.088
- His landlady can attest
to that.

33:12.124 --> 33:14.424
- Thank you, constable.
That'll be all.

33:14.960 --> 33:16.593
(soft music)

33:17.562 --> 33:19.329
- Ezra steele confirms
her alibi.

33:19.398 --> 33:21.831
They were together
the entire night at his place.

33:22.434 --> 33:23.566
- So, what now?

33:24.703 --> 33:26.369
We're back to square one,
without any suspects.

33:26.438 --> 33:29.973
- Who else would have motive
to kill an out-of-town musician?

33:31.043 --> 33:33.710
- Well, process of elimination
means...

33:33.712 --> 33:37.380
It has to be someone who was at
the salon early in the morning,

33:37.383 --> 33:39.449
Had access to the gun

33:39.518 --> 33:41.084
And heard the song.

33:42.254 --> 33:43.520
- Right, crabtree.

33:43.522 --> 33:45.822
We need to go back
to the scene of the crime.

33:47.026 --> 33:48.424
(groans)
thank you.

33:49.361 --> 33:50.994
(intriguing music)

33:51.129 --> 33:52.829
- Problem's been solved.

33:52.898 --> 33:54.264
I don't know what
you're worried about.

33:55.534 --> 33:57.267
- What I'm worried about
is any unnecessary attention

33:57.402 --> 33:59.335
From the toronto constabulary
on my business.

33:59.371 --> 34:01.938
- I cleaned up a mess to save
your partner from the noose.

34:03.175 --> 34:04.474
- You don't stick your neck out
for anyone but me.

34:06.144 --> 34:07.277
- Yes, boss.

34:07.346 --> 34:10.013
- And please, don't act like
you did this for me.

34:10.082 --> 34:11.681
There were plenty of
other women

34:11.683 --> 34:13.349
You could have been fooling
around with in the city,

34:13.385 --> 34:14.818
But you had to get sweet
on this one!

34:15.754 --> 34:17.087
- I made a mistake.

34:19.257 --> 34:21.357
- Push!
(yells in pain)

34:22.361 --> 34:23.827
(panting)

34:24.863 --> 34:26.496
- I don't want to do this,
william.

34:27.399 --> 34:29.799
- You are doing so well, julia.

34:30.836 --> 34:33.103
But please, keep breathing

34:33.172 --> 34:36.172
And I just need one more push.

34:37.642 --> 34:38.774
One more push.

34:38.811 --> 34:40.543
(panting)

34:42.614 --> 34:45.047
(crying in pain)

34:47.385 --> 34:48.452
(baby crying)

34:49.955 --> 34:51.454
(panting)

34:57.463 --> 34:58.929
- You did it!

34:59.064 --> 35:00.931
(soft music)

35:00.933 --> 35:02.132
It's a little girl!

35:02.801 --> 35:04.134
(laughs)

35:04.870 --> 35:06.068
(sighs)

35:07.005 --> 35:08.872
(baby fussing,
julia crying softly)

35:13.579 --> 35:15.011
What do I do now?

35:15.547 --> 35:17.013
(sobs)

35:18.817 --> 35:19.616
(door opens)

35:22.354 --> 35:23.819
- Goodness gracious!

35:23.856 --> 35:24.921
(laughs)

35:24.990 --> 35:27.424
Well, celebrate the moment!

35:27.426 --> 35:28.824
Congratulations!

35:28.861 --> 35:30.093
(chuckles)

35:32.030 --> 35:32.896
(sighs)

35:32.898 --> 35:34.030
- Let's go home.

35:36.535 --> 35:39.135
- Let's say the attack
happened right here.

35:40.305 --> 35:42.905
Horatio's struck from behind
and he falls here.

35:42.941 --> 35:45.241
He's on the ground with blood
pooling all around.

35:46.612 --> 35:48.378
- Lead belly stumbles in after
a late night at the cathouse.

35:49.481 --> 35:51.447
The sun is coming up,
he sees the blood.

35:51.517 --> 35:53.449
- With the rainbow
reflected in it.

35:53.485 --> 35:56.586
- But he's still so drunk
that what he sees,

35:56.721 --> 35:58.188
It doesn't really register.

35:58.323 --> 35:59.989
- All he wants to do
is pass out.

36:00.025 --> 36:02.192
- Which he does,
in the makeshift bed

36:02.194 --> 36:04.327
Miss bright set up for him at
the back of the salon.

36:04.363 --> 36:06.796
- By the time he wakes up,
inspired,

36:06.832 --> 36:09.298
He has no idea he's writing
about his friend's murder.

36:10.235 --> 36:11.634
- But how did he not see
the killer?

36:12.938 --> 36:15.071
- And who could have been
in the same space the whole time

36:15.140 --> 36:17.273
Without being noticed?
(door opens)

36:17.409 --> 36:18.441
(gasps)

36:19.178 --> 36:20.677
(panting)

36:27.085 --> 36:28.818
(both): The lady
in the brown bottle.

36:29.955 --> 36:31.220
- Well, hello.

36:35.761 --> 36:37.761
(soft music)

36:39.164 --> 36:41.330
- The rhythm of the carriage
must be lulling her to sleep.

36:42.568 --> 36:44.100
- I'm surprised you aren't
asleep

36:44.102 --> 36:45.601
After the night we've had.

36:47.172 --> 36:49.639
- Oh, I just can't stop
looking at her.

36:51.042 --> 36:53.075
- I can't believe she's here.

36:53.912 --> 36:55.278
- It's official for you.

36:56.347 --> 36:58.114
You're the daddy to
a little girl.

36:58.150 --> 37:00.450
- May I... Hold her?

37:02.087 --> 37:04.120
- I just... I'd hate
to wake her.

37:04.156 --> 37:05.922
- Oh.
- Alright.

37:06.858 --> 37:07.790
- Ooh...

37:08.727 --> 37:10.326
- Make sure you support
her head.

37:10.395 --> 37:11.661
- Oh, yes, yes.

37:11.796 --> 37:14.130
- Oh!
- Wouldn't want to break her.

37:14.199 --> 37:15.398
(laughs)

37:15.400 --> 37:16.532
- It's not possible.

37:17.669 --> 37:19.436
(soft music)

37:21.940 --> 37:24.074
- You could use this time
to read your book.

37:24.209 --> 37:26.842
I know we didn't get all
of the time we thought we would.

37:27.746 --> 37:29.679
- You're right,
it's a good idea.

37:30.882 --> 37:31.948
(sighs)

37:33.685 --> 37:37.420
- There is so much I have
to tell you.

37:39.992 --> 37:44.494
Fantastical tales,
unbelievable yarns.

37:45.430 --> 37:48.031
Your mother is...

37:48.100 --> 37:49.165
(softly snoring)

37:49.668 --> 37:50.866
...Asleep.

37:54.906 --> 37:57.673
Once again, your mother
has the right idea.

37:58.877 --> 38:01.310
(soft music)

38:05.083 --> 38:07.650
- You killed him and
framed his friend. Why?

38:07.653 --> 38:09.185
- He made me a sinner, sir.

38:09.254 --> 38:10.387
- He did?

38:10.389 --> 38:13.990
- He caused me, a good christian
woman, to fall,

38:14.125 --> 38:16.325
Lose my grace
in the eyes of my god.

38:17.596 --> 38:19.729
- How does a travelling musician
sully a woman

38:19.765 --> 38:21.131
As virtuous as you?

38:22.167 --> 38:24.834
- I am made of flesh and blood,
sir.

38:26.271 --> 38:29.072
And was weak in the face
of that intoxicating music
he played.

38:30.275 --> 38:32.475
I gave myself over to him early
Tuesday morning,

38:33.144 --> 38:34.343
In spite of myself.

38:35.147 --> 38:36.613
- And that's why you killed him.

38:36.615 --> 38:38.214
- I killed him
because afterwards,

38:38.283 --> 38:40.649
He threw two dollars at me like
I was a common delilah.

38:41.820 --> 38:43.419
I barely remember pulling
that bottle from my bag

38:43.488 --> 38:45.020
And striking him.

38:46.091 --> 38:49.826
I didn't mean to kill him,
but he was dead.

38:50.762 --> 38:52.128
- And that's when you hid
the body.

38:53.098 --> 38:54.964
- I dragged his body into
the closet.

38:55.000 --> 38:57.733
I knew nobody would look there
until I figured out what to do.

38:58.537 --> 39:00.903
That night, I heard the song.

39:01.906 --> 39:03.573
The lord provides when you
need him.

39:04.509 --> 39:05.641
When the police found
the body,

39:05.677 --> 39:07.377
They could lock up another
sinner.

39:07.512 --> 39:09.512
- And you were fine with
watching an innocent man

39:09.514 --> 39:11.648
Hang for a crime that
you committed?

39:11.783 --> 39:14.784
- Innocent?
He's the devil's instrument,

39:14.919 --> 39:16.285
Singing about murder.

39:17.656 --> 39:19.822
I would be doing the lord's work
removing him from this earth.

39:21.393 --> 39:23.326
- That's where you're wrong,
young lady.

39:24.763 --> 39:26.863
It's only because you killed
his friend that he was inspired

39:26.932 --> 39:28.331
To write that song.

39:28.400 --> 39:31.734
And you, using his words
to commit further indignities

39:31.737 --> 39:33.870
On the body
is what led us to you.

39:34.005 --> 39:35.071
- No.

39:35.206 --> 39:36.372
I don't believe it.

39:37.342 --> 39:39.409
Sinful ways lead
to righteous punishment.

39:40.478 --> 39:42.945
- The lord works
in mysterious ways.

39:44.416 --> 39:46.482
- He will forgive me for what
I've done to protect my virtue.

39:47.719 --> 39:49.685
- I don't think you'll see god
where you're going.

39:53.958 --> 39:56.358
(dramatic music)

39:56.995 --> 39:59.862
(door opens, closes)

40:04.736 --> 40:07.103
D kick of a mule,
crabtree.

40:07.105 --> 40:08.504
(chuckles)

40:08.640 --> 40:11.474
That's gonna be the last time
I see the inside of a jail.

40:11.476 --> 40:13.543
- Well, I tell you what.
With your talent,

40:13.678 --> 40:15.311
All I see is a rising star.

40:15.380 --> 40:17.713
- You know what? I did get
a song or two out of it.

40:17.749 --> 40:20.516
But I think I'm ready for a few
more happier experiences.

40:20.652 --> 40:21.951
- Indeed!
(laughs)

40:22.086 --> 40:24.254
You know, I envy you
that you can write a song
just like that.

40:24.389 --> 40:25.922
It takes me forever to write
a book!

40:25.924 --> 40:28.925
In any case, I hope
we do get to see each other
again, some day.

40:30.195 --> 40:32.662
- You know what? Come on down
with me to louisiana.

40:32.731 --> 40:33.996
You're an author.

40:34.065 --> 40:36.332
If you can write a story,
you sure enough can write
a song.

40:36.401 --> 40:38.334
- How about I make
a trip down

40:38.470 --> 40:39.869
And you can take me
to mardi gras?

40:39.871 --> 40:41.137
I've always wanted to go.

40:41.139 --> 40:44.340
- Man! Fat Tuesday
can't come fast enough.

40:44.409 --> 40:45.808
(laughing)

40:47.011 --> 40:48.678
Take care of yourself,
crabtree.

40:48.813 --> 40:50.213
- Safe travels, lead belly.

40:51.750 --> 40:53.416
(gently humming)

41:00.025 --> 41:01.490
(indistinct announcement)

41:01.526 --> 41:04.561
- You know, I spend most
of my waking life at work,

41:04.563 --> 41:08.163
It's not often that my friends
get to experience

41:08.200 --> 41:09.899
That side of me.
- Hmm.

41:09.901 --> 41:11.434
- Thank you for last night,
milo.

41:11.569 --> 41:13.236
- Your work is intriguing.

41:14.706 --> 41:16.505
I have a newfound appreciation
for what you do, llewelyn watts.

41:16.541 --> 41:19.575
- Oh, I dare say,
you made my job... Fun?

41:19.644 --> 41:20.443
(chuckles)

41:21.713 --> 41:22.812
Now, are you up for an evening
that doesn't include

41:22.881 --> 41:24.581
A dead body tonight?

41:24.716 --> 41:26.448
- Well, as wonderful as
that sounds,

41:26.485 --> 41:29.052
I am spending the evening
with byron, remember?

41:29.821 --> 41:31.253
- Yes, of course.

41:31.990 --> 41:33.856
Byron, how could I forget?

41:34.526 --> 41:35.624
- I'm here with you now.

41:36.861 --> 41:38.093
What does it matter
who I spend the evening with?

41:41.332 --> 41:43.065
The devil made me do it.

41:48.072 --> 41:49.205
(sighs)

41:52.677 --> 41:54.878
(soft music)

41:59.217 --> 42:01.217
- Her eyes, julia.

42:01.286 --> 42:03.686
I can't stop looking at
her little eyes.

42:03.755 --> 42:05.721
- Good, I thought that
was just me.

42:07.659 --> 42:08.724
Oh!

42:09.494 --> 42:11.027
- Have you smelled her head?

42:11.029 --> 42:11.894
(chuckles)

42:11.963 --> 42:13.963
I just... I can't put her down.

42:14.966 --> 42:16.499
- May I hold her now?

42:16.568 --> 42:17.500
(gasps)

42:17.569 --> 42:18.902
- Oh...

42:21.973 --> 42:23.172
- Hmm!

42:23.241 --> 42:24.974
(baby fussing)

42:26.845 --> 42:28.044
(chuckles)

42:29.514 --> 42:30.780
What?

42:31.950 --> 42:34.584
- Julia ogden,
you are so beautiful.

42:34.719 --> 42:36.251
- Oh!
(laughs)

42:36.288 --> 42:38.454
What I am is sleep-deprived.

42:39.257 --> 42:41.724
I am also deliriously happy.

42:42.661 --> 42:44.460
I can't believe this day
has come.

42:46.197 --> 42:48.932
- I may be biased,
but I think she's perfect.

42:49.067 --> 42:50.300
- Not biased at all.

42:50.435 --> 42:52.001
I've never seen
a more perfect baby.

42:52.070 --> 42:52.901
- I know!

42:55.006 --> 42:56.572
What should we name her?

42:57.142 --> 42:58.674
I was thinking...

42:59.877 --> 43:00.743
Muskoka!

43:00.745 --> 43:03.545
- Oh, william, no!

43:03.582 --> 43:06.482
- What, think of the interesting
story we could tell

43:06.618 --> 43:08.351
To embarrass her
at dinner parties.

43:08.486 --> 43:09.819
(laughs)

43:09.954 --> 43:11.187
- I was thinking...

43:12.423 --> 43:14.056
Susannah would be lovely.

43:14.960 --> 43:17.160
(soft music)

43:20.832 --> 43:25.701
- Oh, I can't think
of a better way to honour
my sister, julia.

43:25.770 --> 43:27.370
That is...

43:27.372 --> 43:28.504
Oh...

43:28.540 --> 43:29.772
Thank you.

43:31.509 --> 43:32.474
(sighs)

43:34.312 --> 43:38.313
Welcome to the world,
susannah murdoch.

43:41.453 --> 43:43.052
(intriguing music)

44:10.415 --> 44:11.414
Subtitling: Difuze
