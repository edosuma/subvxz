Jackpot.

02:36.357 --> 02:37.725
Sinaloa fronted the shipment

02:37.791 --> 02:40.228
- for a 60% return.
- ...transitionary person.

02:40.261 --> 02:41.495
They're offering credit deals.

02:41.562 --> 02:42.972
You guys must be
doing something right.

02:42.996 --> 02:44.131
Take that to Ramirez.

02:44.232 --> 02:45.533
It gets even better.

02:45.599 --> 02:47.668
The guy who organized
all this...

02:47.735 --> 02:49.136
he's a lawyer.

02:49.237 --> 02:50.771
Billy McBride.

02:52.240 --> 02:54.375
You guys ought
to pay me a bonus.

03:01.715 --> 03:03.851
All the dope that's
in this hull.

03:03.917 --> 03:04.918
Sure, kiddo.

03:33.447 --> 03:35.048
Would you stop it?

03:35.115 --> 03:36.950
Fucking stupid!

03:37.017 --> 03:38.352
Stop it!

03:38.419 --> 03:40.120
Banging your fucking
head on the furniture

03:40.187 --> 03:41.389
ain't gonna help you, okay?

03:41.455 --> 03:42.690
You got to get us out of here.

03:42.756 --> 03:44.558
I'm not your lawyer.
And if I were,

03:44.625 --> 03:46.727
I'm not a fucking
magician, okay?

03:46.794 --> 03:49.062
You're a flight risk
and a danger
to the community.

03:49.129 --> 03:51.332
No court's going
to set you a bail.

03:51.399 --> 03:53.200
And if they did,

03:53.301 --> 03:54.678
nobody's going
to post it because...

03:54.702 --> 03:55.736
We didn't do it!

03:55.803 --> 03:57.638
Oh, well, why didn't you say so?

03:57.705 --> 03:59.425
I'll go tell them
and get you out right now.

03:59.473 --> 04:01.775
You got a hull
full of shit, buddy.

04:01.842 --> 04:05.312
You're talking about 20 years
of federal time here.

04:05.313 --> 04:06.914
Doesn't do our case
any good, either,

04:06.980 --> 04:08.382
not that it matters now.

04:11.218 --> 04:12.453
Okay.

04:13.454 --> 04:15.456
Alejandro didn't want to do it.

04:15.523 --> 04:17.958
All right?
I talked him into it.

04:18.024 --> 04:20.694
Well, I'm sorry to hear that.

04:20.761 --> 04:23.431
But how or why
you join a conspiracy

04:23.497 --> 04:24.598
doesn't matter.

04:24.665 --> 04:25.966
Once you're in, you're in,

04:26.033 --> 04:27.335
and you're fucked.

04:28.602 --> 04:30.571
Who talked you into it?

04:33.541 --> 04:36.510
Don't lie to me, Brittany.

04:36.577 --> 04:38.879
I'm working part-time
for a lawyer.

04:38.946 --> 04:41.014
Yeah, go check
if you don't believe me.

04:41.081 --> 04:42.883
I searched your place.

04:42.950 --> 04:44.452
You did what?

04:44.518 --> 04:45.819
Don't play dumb.
You're not dumb.

04:45.886 --> 04:47.621
You're on probation.
You got no rights.

04:47.688 --> 04:49.089
I can walk in
and toss your place

04:49.156 --> 04:50.791
any time I want.

04:50.858 --> 04:53.060
You got new clothes,
new shoes, nice car.

04:53.126 --> 04:54.928
- Come on.
- Girl, you're hooking again.

04:54.995 --> 04:56.930
- That is so unfair.
- This lawyer,

04:56.997 --> 04:59.667
- he's paying you how much?
- It's complicated.

04:59.733 --> 05:01.268
It's complicated.
You're lying to me.

05:01.369 --> 05:03.036
I need to see a 1099
to prove it.

05:04.372 --> 05:05.639
It is very difficult

05:05.706 --> 05:07.207
to get legitimate employment...

05:07.274 --> 05:08.375
Girl, you're white.

05:08.376 --> 05:09.443
You're white.

05:09.510 --> 05:11.011
You're skinny. You're thin.

05:11.078 --> 05:12.613
You're... You're smart.

05:12.680 --> 05:14.515
You've got no excuse.

05:16.817 --> 05:19.086
You want
to rezone this for what?

05:19.152 --> 05:22.189
Office space.

05:22.255 --> 05:23.591
Research labs.

05:23.657 --> 05:25.859
It's part of
the ten-year expansion.

05:25.926 --> 05:27.961
I'm not saying
it's going to be easy.

05:28.028 --> 05:29.262
Shit, if it was easy,

05:29.397 --> 05:31.499
Rocketdyne and Boeing
would already have done it.

05:31.565 --> 05:33.834
But I have faith
in you, Leonard.

05:33.901 --> 05:35.703
You'll get this done.

05:35.769 --> 05:37.471
Well, I'm glad to hear that.

05:37.538 --> 05:39.840
Does this mean you're taking
me off the Larson case?

05:39.907 --> 05:40.941
What?

05:41.008 --> 05:43.877
No, I'm not taking you
off the Larson case.

05:43.944 --> 05:46.414
You can walk and chew gum
at the same time.

05:46.480 --> 05:47.781
You can do both.

05:47.848 --> 05:50.551
Besides, Larson ain't
much of a case anymore.

05:50.618 --> 05:53.020
You did illegal weapons
testing in the Pacific

05:53.086 --> 05:54.287
and then covered it up.

05:54.422 --> 05:55.789
That is a very big thing.

05:55.856 --> 05:59.760
It's a cancer on the
corporation, Wendell.

05:59.827 --> 06:00.894
It can spread.

06:00.961 --> 06:02.563
Look, I need to know
what else there is.

06:02.630 --> 06:04.432
What other shit have
you guys been doing?

06:04.465 --> 06:05.599
Because whatever it is,

06:05.666 --> 06:07.100
you have to assume at some point

06:07.167 --> 06:08.502
that shit is going to come out.

06:08.569 --> 06:11.138
You know what Cooperman
told me about the fishermen?

06:13.040 --> 06:14.875
They're drug dealers.

06:14.942 --> 06:16.109
Yeah.

06:16.176 --> 06:18.211
They were moving dope,

06:18.278 --> 06:21.449
and McBride's whistleblower?
Come on.

06:21.515 --> 06:24.317
Man, that's Ned.
He's nuts, okay?

06:24.452 --> 06:26.720
We shit-canned him
because he's crazy.

06:26.787 --> 06:29.623
And McBride's
buried in that paperwork.

06:30.691 --> 06:33.060
What I need you to do...

06:34.695 --> 06:36.864
is get this land rezoned.

06:37.931 --> 06:40.501
I want an ocean view
in my next office.

06:51.845 --> 06:54.782
♫ Some are waving it around ♫

06:56.817 --> 06:59.587
♫ Someone carried me home ♫

07:00.621 --> 07:02.856
♫ One was never noticed ♫

07:02.923 --> 07:04.825
♫ Sleepin' on the floor ♫

07:04.892 --> 07:09.697
♫ But I know we were there ♫

07:09.763 --> 07:14.334
♫ We were howling
at the moon ♫

07:14.401 --> 07:19.306
♫ We were shakin' our hips ♫

07:19.372 --> 07:24.745
♫ Danced until we flat-out
falling into bed ♫

07:24.812 --> 07:28.849
♫ But I won't let you go ♫

07:28.916 --> 07:33.754
♫ We were howling
at the moon ♫

07:33.821 --> 07:38.559
♫ We were shakin' our hips ♫

07:38.626 --> 07:43.631
♫ Danced until we flat-out
falling into bed ♫

07:43.697 --> 07:48.368
♫ But I won't ♫

07:48.435 --> 07:51.605
♫ Let you go ♫

07:53.541 --> 07:54.808
Jesus.

07:54.875 --> 07:56.309
Hey, Marva.
How's it going?

07:56.376 --> 07:58.245
Well, awful.

07:58.311 --> 07:59.713
Around 3 in the morning,

07:59.780 --> 08:01.949
a bunch of possums decided
to set up shop in here.

08:02.015 --> 08:03.617
I had to chase them out
into the alley.

08:03.684 --> 08:06.554
Marva, we got depositions
to start today.

08:06.587 --> 08:08.555
- Ned, the crazy guy...
- I know.

08:08.556 --> 08:10.257
I've been looking,
Mr. McBride. I have.

08:10.323 --> 08:12.392
But there is just
so much to go through,

08:12.459 --> 08:13.961
and I am just one person.

08:14.027 --> 08:15.062
I understand that,

08:15.128 --> 08:16.897
but you're not looking
for the Holy Grail.

08:16.964 --> 08:19.199
We just need something
to back up Ned's story.

08:19.266 --> 08:20.934
You know?
He said Ryan Larson

08:21.001 --> 08:22.636
was working on
some weapons system

08:22.703 --> 08:24.572
that Borns Tech had
to keep away from people.

08:24.638 --> 08:26.106
It's not much.

08:29.643 --> 08:31.244
What the hell is this?

08:31.311 --> 08:33.212
Ryan Larson's personnel file.

08:33.280 --> 08:35.182
It's all blacked out.

08:35.248 --> 08:36.650
A lot of it is.

08:36.717 --> 08:38.586
It's his classified file
from the military.

08:38.652 --> 08:40.754
It's fucking useless.
What am I going
to do with that?

08:40.821 --> 08:42.089
Well, I don't know.

08:42.155 --> 08:44.457
I thought maybe something
would be in there.

08:44.592 --> 08:45.592
Is it all like that?

08:45.593 --> 08:46.827
Yes, most of it.

08:46.894 --> 08:50.097
I still have about a dozen
boxes to go through.

08:50.163 --> 08:52.065
Keep looking.
We got to find something.

08:52.132 --> 08:53.500
- Okay, hon?
- I'm going to. I am.

08:53.601 --> 08:55.035
I'm dogged in my
pursuit of this.

08:55.102 --> 08:57.142
I know you are, honey.
You want this open or closed?

08:57.204 --> 08:59.472
Oh, God, no.
I want it open.
Leave it open.

08:59.607 --> 09:01.174
All right.

09:03.110 --> 09:04.612
It's a stupid chart.

09:04.645 --> 09:06.479
I never said you were stupid.

09:06.614 --> 09:07.848
Oh, yes, you did,

09:07.915 --> 09:09.516
and you don't do it again,

09:09.617 --> 09:12.219
and you definitely don't
do it during the deposition.

09:12.285 --> 09:13.897
- You understand?
- Why are you mad at me?

09:13.921 --> 09:15.161
You should be mad at the chart.

09:15.222 --> 09:17.390
Okay, explain to me
what is so bad about it.

09:17.457 --> 09:19.259
It's amateurish.
It's embarrassing.

09:19.326 --> 09:21.061
It's wrong. Look at it.

09:21.128 --> 09:23.864
- The dimensions are off.
- You gave us the dimensions!

09:23.931 --> 09:25.709
It looks like a fucking IKEA
schematic to build a credenza.

09:25.733 --> 09:27.367
I gave you an estimate.

09:27.434 --> 09:29.670
Use the original.
Borns Tech has it.

09:29.737 --> 09:31.371
We haven't found it yet
in the discovery,

09:31.438 --> 09:33.941
- but we will.
- I can't even look at this.

09:34.007 --> 09:36.476
I cannot...
This offends me.

09:36.543 --> 09:38.511
Mm. I'm sorry.

09:38.646 --> 09:40.013
What do you want me to say?

09:40.080 --> 09:40.848
You're sorry.

09:40.914 --> 09:43.216
Sorry doesn't feed the cat!

09:43.283 --> 09:44.651
The... Okay.

09:44.652 --> 09:45.753
I'm an engineer.

09:45.819 --> 09:47.387
Precision counts.

09:47.454 --> 09:48.555
- Yo! Yo!
- That's...

09:48.656 --> 09:49.923
Why would you do that?

09:49.990 --> 09:51.458
No. Don't do that.

09:51.524 --> 09:52.960
Put him down.
Put down.

09:53.026 --> 09:54.762
What the fuck is going on?
Put him down!

09:54.828 --> 09:56.229
Get his big ass out of here!

09:57.264 --> 09:58.899
What the fuck is wrong
with you people?

09:58.966 --> 10:00.409
- Shut your fucking mouth.
- What did you do, Ned?

10:00.433 --> 10:01.577
- Me?
- Yeah. What did you do?

10:01.601 --> 10:02.903
I am through with this, okay?

10:02.970 --> 10:04.147
- Really?
- I'm not cut out for this.

10:04.171 --> 10:05.105
I will not testify.

10:05.172 --> 10:06.874
I will not be any part of this.

10:06.940 --> 10:08.384
- Oh, you are fucking...
- I'm calling the police.

10:08.408 --> 10:09.710
Really? Call the police.

10:09.777 --> 10:11.054
You better call a fucking
ambulance, too.

10:11.078 --> 10:13.513
What is wrong with you?

10:13.580 --> 10:15.182
What's wrong with you?

10:15.248 --> 10:17.985
You... All you have to do
is be seen.

10:18.051 --> 10:20.287
That's it.
Not to be heard.

10:20.353 --> 10:22.155
Not to talk to anybody.

10:22.222 --> 10:25.125
And don't touch anybody.
You're not a bouncer.

10:25.192 --> 10:28.796
God, you breathing.
It's like...

10:28.862 --> 10:30.864
You want me to stop breathing?

10:30.931 --> 10:33.133
It's very distracting.

10:33.200 --> 10:34.634
I mean, look, Ned,

10:34.702 --> 10:36.837
you just don't need
to get so wound up, okay?

10:36.904 --> 10:38.405
- I mean...
- I'm sorry. I just...

10:38.471 --> 10:39.973
I get it. I really do.

10:40.040 --> 10:41.374
I'm sorry about all that.

10:41.441 --> 10:43.110
It's just we need you.

10:43.176 --> 10:45.245
You're on our team,
we're on yours.

10:45.312 --> 10:46.947
So just, you know,

10:47.014 --> 10:48.481
relax.
Don't worry about it.

10:48.548 --> 10:49.582
You're gonna do great.

10:49.649 --> 10:50.827
I guarantee you're going to be

10:50.851 --> 10:52.219
the smartest guy in the room.

10:52.285 --> 10:54.354
For Christ's sakes,
you're a rocket scientist.

10:54.421 --> 10:55.789
Yes. I am.

10:57.090 --> 10:59.050
There's not a damn thing
they can trip you up with

10:59.092 --> 11:00.928
when it comes to science, okay?

11:00.994 --> 11:03.263
So they're going to try
to hit you with other stuff,

11:03.330 --> 11:05.098
like, you know,
why did you get fired,

11:05.165 --> 11:07.801
uh, your motive for lying,
your mental situation.

11:07.868 --> 11:09.736
That was caused by them.

11:09.737 --> 11:12.072
Absolutely. Right.
I get it. I get it.

11:12.139 --> 11:15.142
But look, a deposition's
not rocket science.

11:15.208 --> 11:16.643
There's a way to deal with them.

11:16.744 --> 11:20.113
You know? There's really
five simple rules.

11:21.381 --> 11:22.850
When they ask you a question,

11:22.916 --> 11:24.728
if you don't understand it,
just ask them to repeat it.

11:24.752 --> 11:25.919
All right.

11:25.986 --> 11:29.056
Then 2, if they mention
a document,

11:29.122 --> 11:31.591
just ask for it. Tell them
you want to see it.

11:31.658 --> 11:32.793
Right. I want to see it.

11:32.860 --> 11:34.427
Yeah. Even if you
already know

11:34.494 --> 11:35.628
what they're talking about,

11:35.763 --> 11:36.763
it fucks their rhythm up.

11:36.764 --> 11:37.804
That's what happens, yeah.

11:37.865 --> 11:39.767
3, you should answer

11:39.800 --> 11:41.268
with as few words as possible.

11:41.334 --> 11:42.569
One is best if you can.

11:42.635 --> 11:44.104
- Keep it brief.
- Exactly.

11:44.171 --> 11:44.938
Okay.

11:45.005 --> 11:47.640
4, if I object to something,

11:47.775 --> 11:49.977
don't say a fucking word
until I say so.

11:50.043 --> 11:51.378
- Okay?
- Keep it quiet.

11:51.444 --> 11:53.080
Yes.

11:53.146 --> 11:56.416
And 5, uh, about
every hour or so,

11:56.483 --> 11:57.951
ask them if you can take a piss

11:58.018 --> 12:00.253
because that way you and I
can talk with each other.

12:00.320 --> 12:01.321
Okay?

12:01.388 --> 12:03.056
You're gonna be great.

12:03.123 --> 12:04.457
Just make sure you look at Billy

12:04.524 --> 12:06.359
whenever they're
asking you a question.

12:06.426 --> 12:08.796
And don't look at them.

12:12.599 --> 12:14.667
Do you think maybe
she could join us?

12:14.802 --> 12:16.569
Will she be there?

12:16.636 --> 12:18.238
No, she's not...

12:18.305 --> 12:19.807
Oh, I can't.

12:19.840 --> 12:22.042
I... There's something
I got to do.

12:22.109 --> 12:25.178
We can meet up
later if you want.

12:25.245 --> 12:26.713
Oh. Uh...

12:26.814 --> 12:29.817
Yeah. If your deposition
goes well.

12:31.018 --> 12:33.086
- Okay.
- Mm-hmm.

12:33.153 --> 12:35.022
Okay.

12:48.235 --> 12:51.271
Our investigators do fine work.

12:53.073 --> 12:56.076
Leonard Letts
is reviewing this now.

12:56.143 --> 12:58.645
Don't use it till you have to.

12:58.711 --> 13:00.247
We might need it for trial.

13:00.313 --> 13:01.481
Understood.

13:01.548 --> 13:02.850
Also...

13:06.119 --> 13:09.422
Lucy Kittridge will do
the questioning today.

13:12.926 --> 13:14.494
Excuse me?

13:14.561 --> 13:16.663
I think it's best,

13:16.729 --> 13:18.865
and it's the way of nature.

13:18.866 --> 13:21.368
Generation upon generation,

13:21.434 --> 13:23.570
the young replace the old.

13:26.073 --> 13:28.075
Are you sleeping with her?

13:30.077 --> 13:32.745
What an odd question.

13:32.880 --> 13:36.216
I hope you're not creating...

13:37.117 --> 13:39.519
a hostile workplace for her.

13:39.586 --> 13:40.653
Me?

13:40.720 --> 13:41.754
She's your subordinate.

13:41.889 --> 13:42.890
You're her supervisor.

13:42.956 --> 13:44.958
You and I had
a prior relationship.

13:45.025 --> 13:47.694
To mistreat the poor woman
out of jealousy...

13:47.760 --> 13:50.363
Don't flatter yourself, Donald.

13:50.430 --> 13:52.899
What you and I did...

13:52.900 --> 13:55.535
I would hardly call
a relationship.

13:56.904 --> 13:58.371
Diverting though it was.

13:58.438 --> 14:01.074
You were an enthusiastic
participant, if I recall,

14:01.141 --> 14:02.442
not to mention the instigator.

14:02.509 --> 14:05.979
I could sue you
for sexual harassment

14:06.046 --> 14:07.780
and age discrimination

14:07.915 --> 14:10.150
based on this
conversation alone.

14:10.217 --> 14:11.384
This self-same
conversation

14:11.451 --> 14:13.120
would support
Lucy's countersuit...

14:13.186 --> 14:16.056
workplace bias...
against you.

14:19.292 --> 14:23.964
How lucky she is to have you
to look out for her.

14:27.034 --> 14:29.336
The deposition's
in less than an hour.

14:29.402 --> 14:31.571
I guess I'll go tell her
she's doing it.

14:31.638 --> 14:33.106
She knows.

14:41.281 --> 14:43.950
Ned Berring
was a design engineer

14:43.951 --> 14:45.318
for several weapons systems.

14:45.385 --> 14:47.020
His only overlap
with the Larson team

14:47.087 --> 14:48.989
was on the XP200 program.

14:49.056 --> 14:50.457
What is that, exactly?

14:50.523 --> 14:53.126
It doesn't matter
at all, actually.

14:53.193 --> 14:54.703
It has nothing to do with
what happened to Larson.

14:54.727 --> 14:56.163
Are we sure about that?

14:56.229 --> 14:58.465
Yes, I'm sure.
So is Donald.

14:58.531 --> 15:01.034
Ned Berring can only say

15:01.101 --> 15:03.203
that what Larson and his
team was working on

15:03.270 --> 15:04.972
should have never
been by the ocean.

15:05.038 --> 15:07.874
And as for why it was
by the ocean,

15:07.975 --> 15:10.010
we can blame Larson for that.

15:11.878 --> 15:13.113
Alan.

15:13.180 --> 15:17.717
Alan, did you prepare
this notebook?

15:17.784 --> 15:19.519
Uh, yes.

15:20.653 --> 15:22.155
That's not red.

15:22.222 --> 15:23.623
I don't know what color that is,

15:23.690 --> 15:25.092
but it's not what I asked for.

15:25.158 --> 15:28.128
And you've got
questions 35 through 42

15:28.195 --> 15:29.462
in the Redirect section

15:29.529 --> 15:31.731
when I asked for them in Direct.

15:31.798 --> 15:33.200
Sorry.

15:33.266 --> 15:34.501
I don't accept that.

15:34.567 --> 15:36.369
If you can't take
constructive criticism...

15:36.436 --> 15:38.147
- Hey, guys.
-...on mistakes
that you've made...

15:38.171 --> 15:39.506
Excuse me.
Excuse me. Enough.

15:39.572 --> 15:41.150
Could you excuse us
for a moment, please?

15:41.174 --> 15:42.551
No. The deposition
starts in an hour...

15:42.575 --> 15:43.676
Thank you, please.

15:43.743 --> 15:44.811
We don't have time.

15:44.877 --> 15:47.180
Just a moment.
Thank you.

15:51.084 --> 15:52.752
This was my meeting.

15:52.819 --> 15:54.221
Why don't we know anything

15:54.287 --> 15:56.356
about the weapons system
that Ryan Larson worked on?

15:56.423 --> 15:59.692
Because it's classified
above our top secret level.

15:59.759 --> 16:02.762
And have you called Borns Tech

16:02.829 --> 16:06.899
to ask them to up
our classification
status to find out?

16:07.034 --> 16:09.636
Donald doesn't feel
that it's necessary,

16:09.702 --> 16:11.804
and it's not necessary.

16:11.871 --> 16:14.541
The other team doesn't know
what the system is, either.

16:14.607 --> 16:15.808
It's a double blind.

16:15.875 --> 16:17.544
That's not uncommon
for patent cases

16:17.610 --> 16:20.047
in this kind of defense
contractor litigation.

16:20.947 --> 16:22.182
And you know this

16:22.249 --> 16:24.151
because you've worked
on so many of them.

16:25.718 --> 16:28.255
Are you really trying
to unnerve me

16:28.321 --> 16:32.325
now before I go in
for, like, the biggest
deposition of my life?

16:35.062 --> 16:37.630
Lucy, are you sleeping
with Donald Cooperman?

16:39.199 --> 16:41.301
That is none of your business.

16:42.402 --> 16:43.470
Actually,

16:43.536 --> 16:47.440
it's none of your
fucking business.

16:49.676 --> 16:51.244
Wow.

16:51.311 --> 16:53.079
I don't need advice,

16:53.080 --> 16:55.082
nor do I need to be judged,

16:55.115 --> 16:56.716
by a woman whose entire career

16:56.783 --> 16:58.518
is based on who she married.

17:05.392 --> 17:07.594
Good luck at the deposition.

17:13.599 --> 17:15.835
Aah!

17:15.902 --> 17:17.404
Jesus.

17:17.470 --> 17:20.573
They're all such fuckers,
every single one of them.

17:20.640 --> 17:23.776
I would rake her
face off if I could.

17:23.843 --> 17:25.512
And Cooperman's, too.

17:25.578 --> 17:28.415
I mean, at least,
what's left of it.

17:30.317 --> 17:31.384
Ahh.

17:31.451 --> 17:33.720
You can't blame her.
It's not her fault.

17:33.786 --> 17:36.589
She's young and
ambitious and stupid,

17:36.656 --> 17:37.924
just like we were.

17:37.990 --> 17:40.160
I was never stupid.

17:40.227 --> 17:41.894
Of course not.

17:41.961 --> 17:44.764
We don't need to stay here.

17:44.831 --> 17:46.733
We're not chained here.

17:46.799 --> 17:48.501
We could leave.

17:48.568 --> 17:50.437
We just stay here
and put up with this shit

17:50.503 --> 17:52.172
- for the money.
- Right.

17:52.239 --> 17:54.674
Just like Leonard Letts
stays at Borns Tech.

17:54.741 --> 17:58.145
Oh, please.
No one ever died because
Donald fucked them.

17:58.178 --> 17:59.546
And don't kid yourself.

17:59.612 --> 18:01.681
Lucy knows exactly
what she's doing.

18:01.748 --> 18:04.951
You know who I really
hate, though, right?

18:05.017 --> 18:06.153
- You do.
- Billy.

18:06.186 --> 18:07.487
- Billy!
- Yeah.

18:07.554 --> 18:09.031
- You're goddamn right Billy.
- Jesus.

18:09.055 --> 18:10.466
He's the one
that started all of this

18:10.490 --> 18:11.824
with that goddamn Larson case.

18:11.891 --> 18:13.736
- Will you stop?
- Well, you... You can defend him

18:13.760 --> 18:16.162
and do all your usual bullshit,
like you always do,

18:16.163 --> 18:17.464
- but you know what?
- Hey.

18:17.530 --> 18:20.467
I'm right. You just
refuse to see it.

18:23.069 --> 18:24.837
What do you want
from me, Callie?

18:24.904 --> 18:26.973
Seriously.

18:27.039 --> 18:28.708
This isn't just you venting.

18:28.775 --> 18:30.009
What's your agenda here?

18:30.076 --> 18:32.212
Us. Us.

18:33.213 --> 18:34.814
Forget starting our own firm.

18:34.881 --> 18:38.184
I just... I would like
to see what you and I
could be

18:38.185 --> 18:41.188
without your ex-husband
always showing up.

19:03.410 --> 19:05.278
♫ Are you close to mine? ♫

19:05.345 --> 19:07.079
♫ Or could you
blow my mind? ♫

19:07.214 --> 19:10.617
♫ 'cause the heat is up
already passed over time ♫

19:10.683 --> 19:14.887
♫ Well, I'm here to say
I got a better way ♫

19:14.954 --> 19:18.725
♫ Nothing brings me down
with how I feel today ♫

19:18.791 --> 19:21.928
♫ Hey, I'm feelin' good
like you know I should ♫

19:21.994 --> 19:23.430
God damn it.

19:23.496 --> 19:25.232
Here you go, boss.

19:26.233 --> 19:27.667
Go.

19:29.269 --> 19:30.337
All right.

19:30.403 --> 19:31.838
♫ Got the pressure beat ♫

19:31.904 --> 19:33.406
♫ Yeah ♫

19:46.386 --> 19:47.720
Hello again.

19:47.787 --> 19:49.422
I've already
told them that
you're here.

19:49.489 --> 19:51.057
I know that,
and I appreciate it,

19:51.123 --> 19:52.425
but you see,
I know these people.

19:52.492 --> 19:53.860
I know the games they play,

19:53.926 --> 19:55.595
and they're making us
wait for no reason,

19:55.662 --> 19:57.430
and it's bush league bullshit.

19:57.497 --> 19:58.831
Don't worry about it.

19:58.898 --> 20:01.033
I just want my witness
to think I'm a tough guy.

20:01.100 --> 20:02.769
Can I use your restroom?

20:02.835 --> 20:05.071
It's two floors down
to the right
on the elevator.

20:05.137 --> 20:06.906
Uh-uh. No.
I built this place.

20:06.973 --> 20:08.808
There's a bathroom right there

20:08.875 --> 20:09.809
around the corner.

20:09.876 --> 20:11.378
So I can either shit
on the floor here

20:11.444 --> 20:12.845
or use that one.

20:32.465 --> 20:35.368
You're not authorized to be
back here, Mr. McBride.

20:35.435 --> 20:37.904
Oh, hey, Nicole.
How you doing?

20:37.970 --> 20:39.982
I thought the bleeding ulcers
would have got you by now.

20:40.006 --> 20:43.109
I'll call security if you
don't go back to reception.

20:43.175 --> 20:44.644
I'm afraid it's a matter of...

20:44.711 --> 20:45.812
Oh, honey.

20:47.213 --> 20:48.815
I thought we were pals.

20:48.881 --> 20:51.684
Oh, by the way, you know,
I have a hall pass.

20:51.751 --> 20:54.053
Is that... Actually,
it's a subpoena......

20:54.120 --> 20:55.822
for you to testify.

20:57.957 --> 20:59.326
I'm going to depose you

20:59.359 --> 21:01.227
about Donald Cooperman's
relationship

21:01.328 --> 21:04.497
to Gina Larson and Borns Tech,
folks like that.

21:04.564 --> 21:06.399
Give Donnie a kiss on the cheek,

21:06.466 --> 21:08.334
then go wash your mouth
out with kerosene...

21:08.335 --> 21:10.036
for your own good, of course.

21:26.686 --> 21:28.688
I think I might
have hit your car.

21:30.557 --> 21:32.525
I am so, so sorry.

21:32.592 --> 21:34.861
I was rushing to get
to an interview,

21:34.927 --> 21:36.396
and I came too close.

21:36.463 --> 21:37.830
Don't worry about it.

21:37.897 --> 21:38.831
Oh.

21:38.898 --> 21:39.898
Really?

21:39.932 --> 21:40.933
It's nothing.

21:41.000 --> 21:42.368
You're so sweet.

21:42.369 --> 21:44.371
I so can't be late
for this interview.

21:44.404 --> 21:45.772
I also didn't want

21:45.838 --> 21:47.840
to flee the scene of
an accident or anything.

21:47.907 --> 21:50.209
Hey, I mean, that's why
the city carries insurance.

21:50.276 --> 21:53.012
I actually think that scratch
was there from before.

21:53.079 --> 21:54.213
Really?

21:54.280 --> 21:55.548
Mm-hmm.

21:55.615 --> 21:56.849
Wow.

21:59.285 --> 22:01.388
Okay, well, I'd better go, then.

22:01.421 --> 22:03.790
I really need this job.

22:05.124 --> 22:07.026
Hey, uh, what do you do?

22:25.712 --> 22:28.848
Fire the receptionist
who let him past her.

22:33.019 --> 22:35.121
He's aged, don't you think?

22:36.923 --> 22:38.925
I forget, did you actually
work with him?

22:38.991 --> 22:40.460
No, sir. Absolutely not.

22:40.527 --> 22:44.030
I was here, but I never had
anything to do with him.

22:44.096 --> 22:46.833
Mm. Not a fan.

22:46.899 --> 22:48.601
So many were.

22:50.336 --> 22:53.640
How they loved darling Billy.

22:53.706 --> 22:55.441
You should have refused service.

22:55.442 --> 22:58.077
Yes, sir. Sorry.

23:05.652 --> 23:08.120
Consider the subpoena quashed.

23:22.134 --> 23:24.003
Raise your right hand.

23:24.070 --> 23:26.673
I, Ned Berring, swear
to tell the truth,

23:26.739 --> 23:28.775
the whole truth,
and nothing but the truth,

23:28.841 --> 23:30.777
- so help you God.
- I swear.

23:32.244 --> 23:34.013
- Sign here.
- Oh.

23:43.490 --> 23:45.992
Good morning.

23:46.058 --> 23:47.126
Ahem.

23:47.193 --> 23:48.494
For the record,

23:48.495 --> 23:50.597
I'm Lucy Kittridge, et Al,

23:50.663 --> 23:52.765
representing Borns Technologies.

23:52.832 --> 23:54.500
The witness having been sworn,

23:54.501 --> 23:56.869
I will now administer the
customary admonitions and...

23:56.936 --> 23:59.038
- Objection.
- ...warnings... Sorry?

23:59.105 --> 24:01.574
Well, he just now swore
to tell the truth.

24:01.641 --> 24:03.509
- You didn't hear that?
- I heard him.

24:03.510 --> 24:05.187
I have to warn him
what happens if he lies.

24:05.211 --> 24:07.514
Move to strike. What is this?

24:07.580 --> 24:09.348
The man just swore
to tell the truth.

24:09.415 --> 24:11.618
Now you're warning him
not to lie.

24:11.684 --> 24:13.653
That's argumentative.
If you keep it up,

24:13.720 --> 24:15.555
I'll ask for sanctions.

24:18.591 --> 24:20.192
Please state your name
for the record.

24:20.259 --> 24:21.293
Objection.

24:21.360 --> 24:22.629
For what?

24:22.695 --> 24:24.330
Asked and answered
when he took the oath.

24:24.396 --> 24:26.532
You got to listen better.

24:26.533 --> 24:27.834
You're being obstructionist.

24:27.900 --> 24:29.902
- I'm being what?
- You heard me.

24:29.969 --> 24:32.605
Is this your first deposition?

24:34.541 --> 24:36.208
Leonard, are you hearing this?

24:36.275 --> 24:37.877
I swear to God, it sounds

24:37.944 --> 24:40.179
like she's reading
off a practice
script or something.

24:40.246 --> 24:44.550
Mr. McBride, I suffer
from a protected condition

24:44.551 --> 24:46.686
under the Americans
With Disabilities Act.

24:46.753 --> 24:48.254
Accommodation for my condition

24:48.320 --> 24:51.791
includes the memorization
of certain written prompts.

24:51.858 --> 24:54.894
That you would object to
and even mock

24:54.961 --> 24:56.796
my condition and accommodation

24:56.863 --> 24:59.298
is actionable and reprehensible

24:59.365 --> 25:01.768
discrimination on your part.

25:03.035 --> 25:03.970
Wow.

25:04.036 --> 25:05.271
May I proceed?

25:05.337 --> 25:06.272
Absolutely.

25:06.338 --> 25:07.473
Thank you.

25:07.574 --> 25:08.975
Let the record reflect

25:09.041 --> 25:13.345
that the witness has
previously identified himself

25:13.412 --> 25:14.747
as Ned Berring. Now, then...

25:14.814 --> 25:16.048
Hold on. I'd like
to administer

25:16.115 --> 25:17.684
my admonitions and warnings now.

25:17.750 --> 25:19.652
- Are you kidding?
- Is that a legal objection?

25:19.719 --> 25:21.120
You objected when I tried

25:21.187 --> 25:23.022
to administer my
admonitions and warnings.

25:23.089 --> 25:26.192
For the record,
I want every lawyer
and witness on your side

25:26.258 --> 25:29.028
to understand their
separate legal obligations

25:29.095 --> 25:30.763
to come forward
with any information

25:30.830 --> 25:32.207
that a crime or crimes
have been committed.

25:32.231 --> 25:34.600
Mr. McBride, to what
are you referring?

25:34.601 --> 25:35.802
Patty?

25:35.868 --> 25:39.505
Uh, since 2002,
it's a federal crime

25:39.606 --> 25:42.742
for, uh, for corporate
officers or lawyers

25:42.809 --> 25:44.611
not to blow the whistle
pursuant to...

25:44.677 --> 25:46.412
Objection. Move to strike

25:46.478 --> 25:48.715
as irrelevant, argumentative,

25:48.781 --> 25:50.617
assumes facts
not yet in evidence,

25:50.683 --> 25:52.852
and misstates the law.

25:52.919 --> 25:55.254
And, for the record,

25:55.321 --> 25:57.023
who is this person?

25:58.090 --> 25:59.892
This person. Uh,

25:59.959 --> 26:03.162
I'm Patty Solis-Papagian,
attorney at law.

26:03.229 --> 26:04.396
That's who this person is.

26:04.463 --> 26:05.464
So...

26:05.531 --> 26:06.766
May I proceed?

26:06.833 --> 26:08.110
- Uh-huh.
- I wish to hell you would.

26:08.134 --> 26:09.774
I'd like to get
out of here at some point.

26:09.836 --> 26:13.272
Mr. Berring,
in your affidavit,

26:13.339 --> 26:16.643
you swear that you
were an employee
of Borns Technology.

26:20.312 --> 26:21.347
Yes.

26:21.413 --> 26:22.413
And while you were...

26:22.448 --> 26:23.650
May I use the restroom?

26:23.716 --> 26:25.651
Take a break?

26:25.652 --> 26:26.953
Unless you're done.

26:27.019 --> 26:28.659
Then we can just get
the hell out of here.

26:28.721 --> 26:30.232
Unless you have
some relevant questions.

26:30.256 --> 26:32.267
I'm far from done, Mr. McBride.
I'm just getting started.

26:32.291 --> 26:33.425
Take over.

26:33.492 --> 26:34.994
Not my show, Leonard.

26:35.061 --> 26:36.295
What?

26:36.362 --> 26:38.064
Excuse me.

26:41.367 --> 26:43.535
Donald Cooperman
isn't here anymore.

26:43.670 --> 26:45.347
Callie Senate will
continue the questioning

26:45.371 --> 26:46.472
from here on out.

26:47.707 --> 26:49.041
Bringing in the grizzled veteran

26:49.108 --> 26:51.043
to bail out the rookie?
It's about time.

26:54.080 --> 26:56.682
Mr. Berring,
I read your affidavit.

26:56.683 --> 26:58.885
You claim that
Ryan Larson was working

26:58.951 --> 27:01.353
on a highly classified
weapons system?

27:01.420 --> 27:03.756
That is correct.

27:03.823 --> 27:07.760
To which I ask so what?

27:07.827 --> 27:10.596
Ryan Larson was
working on something?

27:10.697 --> 27:11.898
So?

27:11.964 --> 27:14.133
He was paid to work on things.

27:14.200 --> 27:15.367
He killed himself.

27:15.434 --> 27:17.937
What does one thing
have to do with the other?

27:18.004 --> 27:19.371
Nothing.

27:19.438 --> 27:24.176
But Mr. Larson died
in an explosion on a boat

27:24.243 --> 27:27.479
that was caused by the weapon
that he was working on, so...

27:27.546 --> 27:28.948
Do you know that?

27:29.015 --> 27:31.951
Or did Mr. McBride
tell you that?

27:32.018 --> 27:37.056
I wasn't personally there
when it happened, so...

27:37.123 --> 27:40.626
Even if he did use what he was
working on to kill himself,

27:40.727 --> 27:43.863
do you think Borns Tech
should be held responsible?

27:43.930 --> 27:46.432
Borns Tech was supposed
to keep those weapons

27:46.498 --> 27:48.735
away from any inhabited areas,

27:48.801 --> 27:51.103
navigable waters,
especially the ocean,

27:51.170 --> 27:54.306
which they didn't do, obviously.

27:54.373 --> 27:57.143
Or Ryan stole
what he was working on

27:57.209 --> 27:59.345
without Borns Tech's knowledge.

27:59.411 --> 28:00.947
That doesn't matter.

28:01.013 --> 28:04.750
Borns Tech had a legal duty
to keep things safe.

28:04.751 --> 28:06.518
You're not a lawyer, are you?

28:06.585 --> 28:08.454
I'm not a lawyer.

28:08.520 --> 28:10.056
You're a scientist.

28:11.791 --> 28:13.559
Possibly a brilliant one.

28:13.625 --> 28:15.294
- Wouldn't you agree?
- I mean...

28:17.463 --> 28:20.399
There's a lot of smart
people at Borns Tech.

28:20.466 --> 28:22.568
That's very kind of you to say,

28:22.634 --> 28:24.837
especially since they fired you.

28:26.272 --> 28:28.607
A lot of us were victims
of the economic downturn.

28:28.674 --> 28:30.209
Do you have a laptop?

28:30.276 --> 28:31.653
- Of course.
- I got to take a leak.

28:31.677 --> 28:32.879
I'm about to piss my pants.

28:32.945 --> 28:34.847
You're going to have to hold it.

28:35.782 --> 28:37.249
Ahem.

28:38.417 --> 28:39.786
What the fuck is this?

28:39.852 --> 28:41.153
Mr. Berring,

28:41.220 --> 28:43.655
has anyone else had
access to your laptop

28:43.790 --> 28:45.091
in the last, say, six months?

28:45.157 --> 28:46.893
- Objection.
- Grounds?

28:46.959 --> 28:48.027
What are you doing?

28:48.094 --> 28:50.296
Move to strike.
Improper objection.

28:50.362 --> 28:51.430
Irrelevant.

28:51.497 --> 28:52.832
That's for the judge to decide.

28:52.899 --> 28:54.433
We're allowed
to make our record.

28:54.500 --> 28:56.936
We mark as defense exhibits
1 through 3...

28:57.003 --> 28:59.338
still photographs
of a homemade video

28:59.405 --> 29:01.107
of sexual content.

29:02.641 --> 29:05.177
The woman on top, who is that?

29:05.244 --> 29:06.946
That's...

29:07.013 --> 29:08.147
my ex-girlfriend.

29:08.214 --> 29:10.149
Hey, turn that
fucking thing off.

29:10.216 --> 29:11.817
And I presume that's
you on the bottom.

29:11.818 --> 29:13.452
Don't answer that.

29:13.519 --> 29:15.121
Okay, we're done here.

29:15.187 --> 29:16.823
We're going to take this
up to the judge.

29:16.889 --> 29:18.409
No. I'm going to finish
my questioning,

29:18.457 --> 29:20.860
and you can move
to suppress it at trial,

29:20.927 --> 29:22.528
if we get to trial,
which we won't.

29:22.594 --> 29:23.863
I'm going to sue your ass

29:23.930 --> 29:25.073
for invading this guy's privacy.

29:25.097 --> 29:26.833
However you got that video,

29:26.899 --> 29:28.700
you broke the goddamn law.

29:28.835 --> 29:30.136
He made it public.

29:35.174 --> 29:37.243
He has every right to do that.

29:37.309 --> 29:39.478
Not for revenge.

29:39.545 --> 29:40.846
Mr. Berring,

29:40.847 --> 29:44.450
you posted that video
online, didn't you?

29:45.852 --> 29:47.987
Didn't you, sir?

29:48.054 --> 29:50.990
For the record, I'm going
to need a yes or a no answer.

29:51.057 --> 29:53.359
Did you post that video online

29:53.425 --> 29:56.863
as a means of getting revenge
against your ex-girlfriend?

29:59.131 --> 30:00.131
Yes.

30:01.133 --> 30:03.169
So you know, then, I assume,

30:03.235 --> 30:04.703
that you could be sent to prison

30:04.770 --> 30:06.873
for having posted revenge porn,

30:06.939 --> 30:08.607
and that if you
testify in this case,

30:08.674 --> 30:11.577
the jury will be made aware
of your disgusting actions.

30:13.545 --> 30:16.015
Yes. Yes.

30:16.082 --> 30:18.617
To be clear, you also
posted a caption

30:18.684 --> 30:20.086
that went along with the video.

30:20.152 --> 30:21.253
- No. No.
- Did you not?

30:21.320 --> 30:23.956
One second. That...
That was a mistake.

30:24.023 --> 30:25.925
And what did that caption say?

30:29.261 --> 30:30.796
Honestly, I don't remember.

30:30.863 --> 30:32.431
Oh. Well, here.

30:32.498 --> 30:36.468
Maybe this could help
refresh your memory.

30:36.535 --> 30:38.204
Is that the caption?

30:40.639 --> 30:42.008
I believe that's the caption.

30:42.074 --> 30:44.410
What does it say, sir?

30:49.681 --> 30:51.450
"Tastes like chicken."

30:51.517 --> 30:53.619
She broke up with me.
I was angry, okay?

30:53.685 --> 30:56.922
She's lucky
I went out with her
in the first place.

30:56.923 --> 30:58.757
I'm sure she feels lucky, Ned.

30:58.824 --> 31:01.560
Just... It wasn't a crime
when I posted it.

31:01.627 --> 31:02.828
Am I going to go to jail?

31:02.929 --> 31:04.406
You should. You should
go to fucking jail.

31:04.430 --> 31:05.998
I mean, what are we
going to do now?

31:06.065 --> 31:08.234
Ah, God, I can't go to jail!

31:08.300 --> 31:10.336
Come on, Hey. Everybody...
Everybody has a bad day.

31:10.402 --> 31:12.204
You're just having
a little no day.

31:12.271 --> 31:13.982
It's going to be okay.
Would you pick him up?

31:14.006 --> 31:15.006
- God damn.
- Wow.

31:16.542 --> 31:18.677
Come on. Let's go. Up.

31:18.744 --> 31:21.247
Promise me you won't show
that tape to the police.

31:21.313 --> 31:22.814
You're the one
who put it out there!

31:22.949 --> 31:24.092
What the fuck
are you talking about?

31:24.116 --> 31:25.151
I meant from the police!

31:25.217 --> 31:26.618
- Shh.
- Absolutely.

31:26.685 --> 31:27.953
Promise me.
I can't go to jail.

31:27.954 --> 31:29.364
No, no. You're not
going to jail, buddy.

31:29.388 --> 31:30.957
We're going to go back upstairs,

31:31.023 --> 31:32.334
and we're gonna
finish this thing.

31:32.358 --> 31:33.768
It's gonna be okay.
All right? Come on.

31:33.792 --> 31:35.161
We're with you. Let's go.

31:36.028 --> 31:37.997
Oh, God damn it.

31:44.470 --> 31:48.207
In light of the witness'
inability to continue,

31:48.274 --> 31:51.610
we will suspend the deposition
and seek court sanctions,

31:51.677 --> 31:54.613
including the striking
of the witness' testimony.

31:54.680 --> 31:56.648
- We oppose.
- Noted.

31:56.715 --> 31:58.784
Shall we call it a day?

31:58.850 --> 32:00.086
Yeah.

32:02.054 --> 32:04.556
Billy, a word?

32:16.735 --> 32:18.537
Tough day for you.

32:19.871 --> 32:21.373
Not entirely.

32:23.609 --> 32:25.011
This is for you.

32:25.044 --> 32:28.180
Restraining order.

32:28.247 --> 32:30.816
It was Michelle's idea
to serve it privately.

32:30.882 --> 32:32.051
She insisted.

32:32.118 --> 32:34.120
God is she weak
when it comes to you.

32:34.186 --> 32:35.421
Why do I get the feeling

32:35.487 --> 32:37.223
that the actual
restraining order

32:37.289 --> 32:39.258
might have been your idea?

32:40.559 --> 32:43.895
I might have suggested it
as a friend and a colleague.

32:44.030 --> 32:46.465
Is that what they
call it these days?

32:46.532 --> 32:48.033
Colleague?

32:48.034 --> 32:50.069
What kind of man
spies on a woman

32:50.136 --> 32:53.105
he cheated on,
humiliated,
and divorced?

32:53.172 --> 32:56.142
Not a good man.

33:01.180 --> 33:03.282
Is this about
your love of Michelle,

33:03.349 --> 33:05.317
or is it about fucking with me?

33:06.385 --> 33:07.586
Both.

33:07.653 --> 33:13.059
Fucking Michelle and you
seems like a win-win to me.

33:15.761 --> 33:16.761
Bye, Billy.

33:18.164 --> 33:20.199
See you real soon, Callie.

33:30.542 --> 33:33.379
I mean, there's no way
she can keep me away
from my own house.

33:33.445 --> 33:35.147
It's not your house
anymore, Dad.

33:35.214 --> 33:37.549
My name's still on the title.

33:37.616 --> 33:39.218
And you're in it.

33:39.285 --> 33:41.125
Restraining order
didn't say anything
about you.

33:41.153 --> 33:43.089
She is so pissed off.

33:43.155 --> 33:46.192
I've never seen her so mad.
What did you do?

33:46.258 --> 33:48.094
- Nothing.
- That's a lie.

33:48.160 --> 33:50.729
I could ask her.

33:50.796 --> 33:52.264
She wouldn't tell me.

33:53.632 --> 33:57.203
I'll lie and say
that you already told me

33:57.269 --> 33:59.371
and said it was her fault.

33:59.438 --> 34:01.006
Whatever it is,
she'll believe it,

34:01.107 --> 34:02.908
and she'll be
so pissed off at you

34:02.974 --> 34:04.176
that she'll tell me herself.

34:04.243 --> 34:07.146
- That how it works?
- Yeah, easily.

34:07.213 --> 34:08.947
I kind of invaded
your mom's space

34:09.014 --> 34:10.824
when she was entertaining
a friend, that's all.

34:10.849 --> 34:13.552
Who? Mom doesn't date.

34:13.619 --> 34:16.755
So when you say she was
entertaining a friend,

34:16.822 --> 34:18.224
she doesn't have any,

34:18.290 --> 34:20.391
other than Aunt Callie.

34:22.027 --> 34:23.762
Just forget I said
anything, okay?

34:25.264 --> 34:28.167
Try to get her to drop
the damn restraining order.

34:28.234 --> 34:30.402
I don't take sides.

34:31.703 --> 34:33.205
You wouldn't want me to.

34:34.672 --> 34:37.443
I wish I'd never
taught you anything.

34:45.451 --> 34:47.453
I guess I was technically
in the house, wasn't I?

34:47.518 --> 34:49.321
Better get the fuck out of here.

34:49.388 --> 34:50.621
Take care of yourself.

34:56.661 --> 34:58.530
Hey, what's up, baby?
How you doing?

34:58.597 --> 35:00.399
Come here.
What are you doing?

35:00.466 --> 35:02.634
I swear to you, Lady. I don't
have anything right now.

35:02.701 --> 35:04.803
I don't have anything.
It's just my hand.

35:04.870 --> 35:06.071
All right?

35:07.239 --> 35:08.640
Sorry. It's happy hour.

35:08.707 --> 35:10.376
I'll see if I can
find you something.

35:10.442 --> 35:11.543
Okay?

35:25.191 --> 35:26.358
You said it went bad,

35:26.425 --> 35:28.093
but Jesus, Billy,
this is horrible.

35:28.194 --> 35:29.361
Yeah.

35:30.496 --> 35:32.431
I mean, "Tastes like chicken"?

35:33.765 --> 35:36.335
I'm just impressed
he had a girlfriend.

35:38.204 --> 35:40.206
Well, good luck with the jury.

35:40.239 --> 35:42.641
Do you have anything
for me at all?

35:42.708 --> 35:44.510
Anything that's not depressing?

35:44.576 --> 35:49.215
The cop who beat you up,
he knows something.

35:50.216 --> 35:50.849
Okay.

35:50.916 --> 35:52.251
Oh. Wait.

35:52.318 --> 35:53.719
Marva told me
to give this to you.

35:53.785 --> 35:56.121
Shit. Uh, she found it
in the discovery

35:56.222 --> 35:57.823
under Ryan Larson Personal.

35:59.525 --> 36:01.560
That's his suicide
letter, right?

36:05.063 --> 36:06.832
So Borns Tech said

36:06.898 --> 36:09.000
that they found this letter

36:09.067 --> 36:10.636
in Ryan's office desk.

36:12.838 --> 36:16.442
It's just like the one
I found in his desk at home.

36:17.476 --> 36:18.577
Okay, so now you're saying

36:18.644 --> 36:20.111
he, uh, did kill himself.

36:20.246 --> 36:21.589
But there's different
stuff in them.

36:21.613 --> 36:23.053
Like, there's a line
that's different

36:23.081 --> 36:24.383
in the handwritten one

36:24.450 --> 36:26.252
that's not even
in the Borns Tech one.

36:26.285 --> 36:29.888
It says "Jason"...
right down here...

36:29.955 --> 36:31.690
uh, "Jason, don't forget

36:31.757 --> 36:34.260
to dig up our time capsule
this summer."

36:34.326 --> 36:36.027
You know anything
about that, Jason?

36:36.094 --> 36:38.830
Uh, when I was in sixth grade,

36:38.897 --> 36:40.299
uh, back when I was a kid,

36:40.366 --> 36:42.501
I, uh, had to do
a school project,

36:42.568 --> 36:45.471
and, uh, I had to bury
a family time capsule.

36:45.537 --> 36:48.707
But I'm not supposed
to dig it up till I'm 21.

36:50.008 --> 36:51.777
There's a beer in it.

37:01.587 --> 37:03.822
We had a lot
of stuff in there...

37:03.889 --> 37:06.292
um, newspapers...

37:07.326 --> 37:08.360
pictures of the family,

37:08.427 --> 37:11.830
coins, stamps, some predictions.

37:17.669 --> 37:20.939
Father Anan
came over last night.

37:21.006 --> 37:23.208
Did you know that?

37:23.309 --> 37:24.943
No, I didn't.

37:26.678 --> 37:28.380
I thought he wanted
to check up on Jason,

37:28.447 --> 37:30.882
but he wanted to talk to me...

37:30.949 --> 37:32.851
to confess, he said.

37:38.324 --> 37:40.592
Ryan didn't kill himself.

37:42.193 --> 37:43.462
Father Anan didn't say anything

37:43.529 --> 37:45.230
because... to me because I...

37:45.331 --> 37:47.399
was so sure he had.

37:51.970 --> 37:55.240
Look, the good news is
it's not too late

37:55.341 --> 37:57.543
to help us figure out
what happened.

37:58.944 --> 38:00.464
I mean, you're going
to have to testify

38:00.512 --> 38:02.347
one way or another, right?

38:02.348 --> 38:06.051
So why not do it
as part of our team?

38:10.756 --> 38:11.857
Okay.

38:13.525 --> 38:14.869
We got to be getting closer.

38:14.893 --> 38:16.928
I don't remember
burying it this deep.

38:20.666 --> 38:22.677
Were you actually there
when your dad sealed the box?

38:22.701 --> 38:24.436
You watched him close it?

38:24.503 --> 38:27.473
Um, yeah, I think so.

38:27.539 --> 38:31.477
I mean, we had a whole
pile of stuff, and...

38:31.543 --> 38:32.978
We didn't have the right box.

38:34.580 --> 38:37.583
So my dad took it to work,

38:37.649 --> 38:40.285
and he said he had
a perfect container for it,

38:40.386 --> 38:41.853
waterproof and everything.

38:41.920 --> 38:44.723
Um, plus, the lab
had a sealant for it.

38:46.658 --> 38:48.560
So then it's possible that, uh,

38:48.627 --> 38:50.962
there can be stuff in there
that you didn't see,

38:51.029 --> 38:53.799
that you don't know
about, right?

38:53.865 --> 38:55.434
Yeah, I guess.

38:59.304 --> 39:00.906
Why don't you go on
in the house?

39:00.972 --> 39:02.408
I'll take it from here.

39:03.409 --> 39:04.710
Are you sure?

39:04.776 --> 39:06.545
There's no sense in you
digging this mess up.

39:06.612 --> 39:08.714
I'll do it.
Just go on inside.

39:08.780 --> 39:10.416
Okay.

39:48.787 --> 39:50.456
Should we get it
X-rayed or something

39:50.522 --> 39:51.890
before we open it?

39:53.358 --> 39:55.193
It's his own kid's time capsule.

39:55.260 --> 39:57.095
It's not like it's
going to blow up.

39:58.396 --> 39:59.765
Well, what if he put some of

39:59.831 --> 40:01.667
whatever he was
working on in there?

40:01.733 --> 40:03.935
Why would he do that?

40:05.103 --> 40:07.839
To prove that it was
bad or something?

40:07.906 --> 40:09.374
I don't know.
You're the one

40:09.441 --> 40:11.142
who said he was
covering his ass.

40:16.548 --> 40:18.349
Actually, you're not wrong.

40:18.416 --> 40:19.985
About what?

40:20.051 --> 40:21.720
About not opening it up.

40:21.787 --> 40:24.523
I mean, say there's something
good for us in there.

40:24.590 --> 40:26.592
We could have a chain
of custody problem,

40:26.658 --> 40:28.960
- say we planted it.
- Mm-hmm.

40:30.696 --> 40:32.764
Okay, so...
so what do we do?

40:51.016 --> 40:54.520
Why didn't you tell me
about the sex video?

40:58.423 --> 40:59.591
You made me the first chair

40:59.658 --> 41:01.026
in the case, didn't you?

41:01.092 --> 41:01.893
Why didn't you tell me

41:01.960 --> 41:03.528
about the main piece
of evidence?

41:03.529 --> 41:04.963
That doesn't make any sense.

41:07.666 --> 41:09.601
You know, I expect
to be screwed over

41:09.668 --> 41:11.036
from everybody else,

41:11.102 --> 41:14.205
but I really don't see it
coming from my own team.

41:17.809 --> 41:19.578
I don't know what that means.

41:26.785 --> 41:28.654
Would you come here?

41:43.602 --> 41:45.671
Would you sit?

41:50.208 --> 41:51.643
Would you please...

41:53.478 --> 41:54.880
sit?

42:26.177 --> 42:27.646
Maybe...

42:29.147 --> 42:34.085
it's a mistake to have
me on this case.

42:38.523 --> 42:39.858
Maybe...

42:41.492 --> 42:43.194
I'm not ready.

42:48.266 --> 42:49.768
You did fine.

42:51.770 --> 42:53.905
He fucked with me, and...

42:55.340 --> 42:59.177
I have to... do better.

43:01.346 --> 43:03.248
You did fine.

43:13.258 --> 43:15.026
It's so perfect.

43:18.697 --> 43:21.833
It's like a piece of porcelain.

43:26.004 --> 43:29.374
People tend to draw
moral conclusions,

43:29.440 --> 43:31.810
judgments about...

43:34.412 --> 43:36.314
burn victims.

43:41.586 --> 43:44.322
I'm thought of as a monster.

43:55.166 --> 43:57.468
Do you see me as a monster?

43:57.535 --> 43:59.404
No.

44:20.125 --> 44:21.126
Ah.

44:31.970 --> 44:33.972
Tell me about your brother.

44:38.777 --> 44:41.112
What do you know
about my brother?

44:42.180 --> 44:43.782
Tell me.

45:03.168 --> 45:05.203
We close in a half an hour.

45:05.270 --> 45:06.404
Okay. I won't be long.

45:06.471 --> 45:07.471
All right.

45:20.786 --> 45:22.220
Oh. Here you go.

46:40.999 --> 46:43.501
Your boyfriend doesn't
return my calls anymore.

46:43.568 --> 46:45.036
Why is that?

46:46.504 --> 46:47.873
Who are you?

46:47.906 --> 46:49.875
Who am I?

46:51.176 --> 46:53.411
Your boyfriend knows who I am.

46:53.478 --> 46:54.579
Have him call me.

46:58.016 --> 47:00.251
I don't have a boyfriend.

47:00.318 --> 47:02.320
No? You don't
have a boyfriend?

47:02.387 --> 47:05.790
So you're just fucking
Donald Cooperman, then?

47:05.891 --> 47:08.393
How's that working out for you?

47:11.096 --> 47:15.600
Tell him to answer my calls.

47:28.413 --> 47:29.447
There you go, Ned.

47:34.552 --> 47:35.987
My God.

47:37.923 --> 47:39.390
Where did you get that?

47:41.226 --> 47:43.561
Larson buried it by his house,

47:43.628 --> 47:45.130
and I dug it up.

47:45.196 --> 47:46.531
There's a note with it

47:46.597 --> 47:47.932
that said that this thing

47:47.933 --> 47:50.401
is what he was working on
at Borns Tech.

47:50.468 --> 47:52.403
No shit. This?

47:52.470 --> 47:53.538
He was working on this?

47:53.604 --> 47:55.373
That's what it said.

47:55.440 --> 47:57.675
Isn't this what we
drew the diagram for?

47:57.742 --> 47:58.776
No.

47:58.843 --> 48:01.379
Decidedly, absolutely not.

48:01.446 --> 48:04.449
- So you lied again.
- No.

48:04.515 --> 48:05.683
Why do you bring her?

48:05.750 --> 48:07.218
Because it's her case,

48:07.285 --> 48:08.486
and you're fucking it up.

48:08.553 --> 48:10.655
Hey, did you happen
to tell Brittany

48:10.721 --> 48:12.390
about what happened?

48:12.457 --> 48:13.391
About the tape?

48:13.458 --> 48:15.360
Of course not.
There's no reason to.

48:15.426 --> 48:17.862
Now, Ryan didn't work
on this, then.

48:17.963 --> 48:19.830
No. Listen to me.

48:19.965 --> 48:21.466
This abomination

48:21.532 --> 48:23.601
is not what Ryan's team
was working on.

48:23.668 --> 48:27.538
Or at least it wasn't
what they said
they were working on.

48:27.605 --> 48:28.974
Then what is it?

48:31.642 --> 48:32.643
This...

48:35.080 --> 48:36.381
is a war crime.

48:36.447 --> 48:39.117
And anybody who worked
on this is a war criminal.

48:39.184 --> 48:41.086
And if Borns Tech
really did work on this,

48:41.152 --> 48:42.820
then Borns Tech
are fucking monsters,

48:42.887 --> 48:45.256
and they will kill you
before they let you prove it.

48:52.063 --> 48:54.499
Yeah, the girl was a Methodist,

48:54.565 --> 48:56.534
so I used to go to church
with her all the time

48:56.601 --> 48:58.179
because I'd spend the weekend
with her family.

48:58.203 --> 48:59.437
Yeah.

48:59.504 --> 49:02.640
It always looked like
a Catholic church to me.

49:02.707 --> 49:03.874
Mr. McBride...

49:04.009 --> 49:05.186
The stained glass
windows, I guess.

49:05.210 --> 49:06.411
You did not come here

49:06.477 --> 49:08.513
to talk to me
about your girlfriend.

49:08.579 --> 49:10.015
So please.

49:11.549 --> 49:12.583
Sorry.

49:15.020 --> 49:16.221
Actually, I...

49:16.287 --> 49:20.025
I came to tell you
we got some good news.

49:20.058 --> 49:24.129
Uh, we found a letter and, uh,

49:24.195 --> 49:27.732
some evidence
that backs up our theory.

49:30.035 --> 49:32.170
Larson was working
on something real bad,

49:32.237 --> 49:33.338
and it killed him

49:33.404 --> 49:35.606
and a lot of other people, too.

49:35.673 --> 49:36.707
So...

49:37.942 --> 49:39.144
Perhaps something good

49:39.210 --> 49:40.845
will come of your
case after all.

49:40.911 --> 49:42.547
Yeah, maybe.

49:42.613 --> 49:44.115
I sure hope so.

49:47.285 --> 49:51.122
But, uh, the bad news is
we still have to prove it all.

49:51.189 --> 49:52.923
I'd like to get you on the stand

49:53.058 --> 49:55.326
as a witness at trial.

49:55.393 --> 49:59.164
You know, a good priest
can carry the day.

49:59.230 --> 50:02.167
I've been dismissed
from the clerical state.

50:03.268 --> 50:05.336
What do they think you did?

50:07.972 --> 50:12.777
There are only five offenses
that merit excommunication.

50:12.843 --> 50:17.882
Telling you what Ryan Larson
talked about in the confession

50:17.948 --> 50:20.318
is one of the five.

50:24.389 --> 50:28.259
So that's it? You're done?
You're not a priest anymore?

50:28.326 --> 50:30.328
No. I'm always a priest.

50:30.395 --> 50:33.698
Holy ordination is for life.

50:35.166 --> 50:37.435
But I cannot serve as a priest.

50:38.803 --> 50:41.606
I cannot receive
Communion for my soul.

50:43.208 --> 50:45.276
How can I offer it to others?

50:50.448 --> 50:55.953
You have cost me everything
I cherish and love,

50:56.020 --> 50:57.622
Mr. McBride.

51:00.125 --> 51:01.792
I hope it is worth it.

51:11.669 --> 51:13.238
I'm sorry, Father.

51:29.854 --> 51:32.957
So do we know exactly
what it was that he found?

51:33.023 --> 51:36.727
We know they were digging

51:36.794 --> 51:39.797
and unearthed something.

51:39.864 --> 51:42.300
Maybe it was buried treasure.

51:46.604 --> 51:48.806
Donald, do I know
all there is to know

51:48.873 --> 51:50.708
with respect for this case?

51:52.743 --> 51:54.612
I don't know. Do you?

51:54.679 --> 51:57.482
Th-That's
not a fucking answer.

51:57.548 --> 51:59.184
I'm kind of getting sick of you

51:59.217 --> 52:01.018
talking to me in cryptic circles

52:01.085 --> 52:02.186
because that's what you do.

52:03.554 --> 52:06.023
You sit in this goddamn
dark office

52:06.090 --> 52:07.392
all day long.

52:07.458 --> 52:09.727
You keep me in the dark
most of the time.

52:12.330 --> 52:15.566
This is very fucking
weird relationship

52:15.633 --> 52:18.002
for a CEO and attorney to have.

52:19.237 --> 52:21.205
And that. There. That.

52:21.206 --> 52:23.208
That clicking bullshit.

52:23.274 --> 52:25.109
What the fuck is that about?

52:26.344 --> 52:27.678
You answering people by clicking

52:27.745 --> 52:29.980
or doing whatever
the fuck you do.

52:30.047 --> 52:32.350
Jesus Christ.

52:34.585 --> 52:36.521
You sound stressed, Wendell.

52:36.587 --> 52:38.856
Yeah, I'm goddamn stressed.

52:38.923 --> 52:41.659
Do you know what the irony
of it is, though?

52:41.726 --> 52:43.461
On paper...

52:43.528 --> 52:46.497
I look like I'm the master
of my own universe.

52:46.564 --> 52:48.633
Pretty good
fucking universe, too.

52:48.699 --> 52:51.369
But more than not,

52:51.436 --> 52:53.671
I'm a dude at the mercy
of a dark man

52:53.738 --> 52:55.706
with a fucking clicker.

52:55.773 --> 52:57.508
And that's bat shit.

52:59.310 --> 53:02.913
As is all this fucking music
that you pump in here.

53:02.980 --> 53:06.517
This opera. Jesus Christ.

53:08.953 --> 53:10.755
Maybe you should go away.

53:11.956 --> 53:14.124
Get some R&R.

53:14.259 --> 53:17.562
I hear Napa is very nice
this time of year.

53:21.632 --> 53:23.968
What did Billy McBride dig up?

53:26.437 --> 53:28.806
I suspect he's dug up
some dirt, Wendell.

53:28.873 --> 53:30.908
Another non-fucking-answer.

53:30.975 --> 53:33.544
No. I gave you an answer.

53:46.924 --> 53:49.294
I think what we'd better
do is get very aggressive

53:49.327 --> 53:51.929
with our dispute
resolution methodology.

55:51.882 --> 55:53.484
You stinker!
