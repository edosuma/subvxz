00:05.005 --> 00:08.925
[classical music playing]

00:12.595 --> 00:13.430
Oh.

00:13.513 --> 00:16.683
-He'll be here.
-But his part is in 16 bars.

00:16.766 --> 00:19.436
[grunts and panting]

00:19.519 --> 00:20.812
Excuse me. Sorry!

00:21.521 --> 00:24.065
[groaning, panting]

00:25.024 --> 00:25.859
[orchestra swells]

00:26.568 --> 00:28.319
-[note dings]
-[sighs]

00:28.403 --> 00:30.572
[cheers and applause]

00:31.406 --> 00:34.659
I heard before he played triangle
he was in a prison gang.

00:34.743 --> 00:36.578
I heard he was a tech millionaire.

00:36.661 --> 00:39.080
[in French accent] There is a rumor
he is a foreign prince.

00:39.164 --> 00:42.292
-His name is Todd Chavez.
-[gasping]

00:42.375 --> 00:45.795
And he's the most giving man
the world has ever known.

00:45.879 --> 00:49.716
He saved my pregnant daughter
from drowning in a shipwreck,

00:49.799 --> 00:53.344
<i>then he delivered her baby</i>
<i>while they rode on a piece of driftwood.</i>

00:53.428 --> 00:55.722
-[musicians gasp]
<i>-And then he circumcised her baby</i>

00:55.805 --> 00:58.224
<i>while they both hung from the ladder</i>
<i>of the rescue helicopter.</i>

00:58.308 --> 01:00.351
-[gasps]
<i>-Of course, before he did,</i>

01:00.435 --> 01:04.731
<i>Todd Chavez explained that circumcision</i>
<i>has somewhat fallen out of vogue.</i>

01:04.814 --> 01:07.484
<i>They had a spirited</i>
<i>but respectful debate,</i>

01:07.567 --> 01:11.321
<i>and by the end my daughter decided</i>
<i>that since we are of Jewish heritage,</i>

01:11.404 --> 01:14.991
the boy might like to have the option
to become religious if he so chooses.

01:15.075 --> 01:16.826
Sounds like he really helped your daughter

01:16.910 --> 01:19.079
make the decision
that was right for her family.

01:19.162 --> 01:22.290
And last year, when our triangle player
died of starvation

01:22.373 --> 01:24.334
after getting his foot stuck
in his triangle,

01:24.417 --> 01:27.086
Todd Chavez took over
because we needed him.

01:27.170 --> 01:29.422
-What a guy!
-He is always helping others.

01:29.506 --> 01:33.092
You know, sometimes
when that triangle part is coming up,

01:33.176 --> 01:35.428
I find myself hoping he won't show up.

01:35.512 --> 01:38.223
No man should be asked
to give that much.

01:38.306 --> 01:40.767
-He is truly the best of all of--
-Whoa!

01:41.643 --> 01:45.188
Oh, hey, guys. I was eating a taco earlier
and I got salsa on my shirt.

01:45.271 --> 01:48.483
I went to clean it off, but then when
I put my hands in the automatic dryer

01:48.566 --> 01:50.610
I forgot I was still holding the taco.

01:50.693 --> 01:52.153
I got my hands all greasy,

01:52.237 --> 01:54.823
so I couldn't open the doorknob
for an hour.

01:54.906 --> 01:57.117
What you guys talking about?

01:57.951 --> 02:00.370
[theme music playing]

02:51.754 --> 02:55.258
[cell phone alarm music]

02:55.341 --> 02:59.721
[Katrina] So then at 11:00 you're gonna be
giving a policy speech on fracking.

02:59.804 --> 03:00.930
Fracktastic!

03:01.014 --> 03:03.766
Meanwhile, all this talk
of whatever it is you're talking about

03:03.850 --> 03:05.810
-is making me hungry.
-Mmm?

03:05.894 --> 03:07.520
Cheese? Yes, please!

03:07.604 --> 03:10.315
Todd, don't distract Mr. Peanutbutter
with your weird pocket cheeses.

03:10.398 --> 03:13.818
The issue is fracking and the people
really want to know your opinion.

03:13.902 --> 03:15.737
Well, then, color me "the people"

03:15.820 --> 03:17.697
because I would also like
to know my opinion.

03:17.780 --> 03:20.491
You don't have one yet.
The polling research comes in today

03:20.575 --> 03:23.578
and that will decide whether
you're for or against fracking.

03:23.661 --> 03:25.747
Here's a thought:
maybe be against fracking.

03:25.830 --> 03:27.206
-It's terrible!
-Diane.

03:27.290 --> 03:29.417
Just my opinion.
You don't tell me how to do my job.

03:29.500 --> 03:33.004
Also, fracking is the worst. I can't
believe you'd even consider endorsing it.

03:33.087 --> 03:35.006
None of my business.
Gotta get to work. Love you!

03:35.089 --> 03:37.258
-Bye, hon!
-But seriously, seriously,

03:37.342 --> 03:40.386
if you come out in support of fracking
I'm gonna be super upset. Bye!

03:40.470 --> 03:43.181
Where you stand on the issue
doesn't really matter.

03:43.264 --> 03:46.392
What's important is that
you seem sincere and emphatic.

03:46.476 --> 03:49.854
Ohh. Are you a fan of charming
but inessential Will Smith movies?

03:49.938 --> 03:52.815
Because, slight <i>Hitch,</i>
I always show I'm empathic

03:52.899 --> 03:56.110
by taking off my glasses dramatically,
but I kinda lost them.

03:56.194 --> 03:59.656
Wow! This must be what I'd look like
to a starving shipwrecked person.

03:59.739 --> 04:01.950
[sighs] When did you last see the glasses?

04:02.033 --> 04:03.826
I was in a meeting with Princess Carolyn.

04:03.910 --> 04:05.787
She was saying
I'm always forgetting stuff,

04:05.870 --> 04:08.539
so I whipped off my glasses,
looked her square in the eye and said,

04:08.623 --> 04:10.667
"I never forget a thing."

04:10.750 --> 04:12.126
I might have left my glasses there.

04:12.210 --> 04:13.503
Todd, you never do anything.

04:13.586 --> 04:15.797
Why don't you take the campaign bus
over to VIM

04:15.880 --> 04:18.132
and get Mr. Peanutbutter's glasses?
Can you handle that?

04:18.216 --> 04:20.134
I never know if I can handle anything.

04:20.218 --> 04:23.137
That's what makes my life so exciting.

04:23.846 --> 04:26.432
-[both grunting]
-Mr. Peanutbutter, there's a delivery!

04:26.516 --> 04:28.434
[Katrina] He's busy! Just sign for it.

04:28.518 --> 04:30.603
I can't sign for another man's mail.

04:30.687 --> 04:33.856
That's how I ended up with the cremains
of Cornelius Vanderbilt.

04:33.940 --> 04:37.235
It all started when a young Todd--
[grunts] I don't have time for this!

04:37.318 --> 04:38.611
I've got a job to do.

04:38.695 --> 04:40.405
[panting]

04:47.036 --> 04:48.955
-[Princess Carolyn] It's Todd!
-It's me!

04:49.038 --> 04:52.667
You are just the guy I need.
You know the actress Courtney Portnoy?

04:52.750 --> 04:57.088
I think so. She portrayed the formerly
portly consort in <i>The Seaport Resort</i>?

04:57.171 --> 04:59.340
Courtly roles like
the formerly portly consort

04:59.424 --> 05:02.135
are Courtney Portnoy's forte,
but she's got a new action movie

05:02.218 --> 05:04.721
that's supposed to change her image:
<i>Ms. Taken.</i>

05:04.804 --> 05:06.639
You know Mr. Taken
from the <i>Taken </i>movies?

05:06.723 --> 05:08.308
-This is his niece.
-Nice!

05:08.391 --> 05:11.311
This was supposed to be Courtney's
crossover coronation.

05:11.394 --> 05:13.563
But that's sort of been thwarted,
unfortunately,

05:13.646 --> 05:15.356
'cause Courtney's
purportedly falling short

05:15.440 --> 05:17.150
of shoring up four-quadrant support.

05:17.233 --> 05:19.027
Makes perfect sense so far.

05:19.110 --> 05:21.195
The public sees her as out of touch.

05:21.279 --> 05:24.574
We need to make her seem relatable,
and the best way to do that

05:24.657 --> 05:28.453
is to be seen dating a down-to-earth
boring nobody like yourself.

05:28.536 --> 05:30.496
You can do that, right?
You're not doing anything.

05:30.580 --> 05:33.416
I'm kind of busy today.
I gotta pick up these glasses,

05:33.499 --> 05:36.419
and then tonight there was this meeting
I wanted to go to.

05:36.502 --> 05:39.464
This will take no time, I promise.
Meet her for lunch.

05:39.547 --> 05:41.924
The paparazzi will show up,
pop some razzis.

05:42.008 --> 05:45.011
I do love getting my picture taken.
It's proof I exist.

05:45.094 --> 05:47.305
Marvelous!
Judah, prepare the press release.

05:47.388 --> 05:50.558
"Portnoy finds joy in hoi polloi boy toy."

05:51.642 --> 05:53.686
[panting]

05:53.770 --> 05:56.564
Well, we didn't get the polling research
on fracking--

05:56.647 --> 05:57.690
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

05:57.774 --> 06:01.527
Because apparently when the delivery came
someone wouldn't sign for it.

06:01.611 --> 06:02.653
Ooh.

06:02.737 --> 06:07.408
In the future, whenever anyone asks you
to sign Mr. Peanutbutter's name,

06:07.492 --> 06:09.452
-just sign it.
-You got it, chief.

06:09.535 --> 06:11.829
All right, Middle-Aged Yeller,
here's what you're gonna do.

06:11.913 --> 06:14.665
You're gonna give
an impassioned speech on fracking

06:14.749 --> 06:17.919
that doesn't actually take a stand
either way on fracking.

06:18.002 --> 06:19.253
Okay.

06:19.337 --> 06:22.215
Good morning!

06:22.298 --> 06:23.883
Let's talk fracking.

06:23.966 --> 06:26.427
Everyone has very strong opinions
about it,

06:26.511 --> 06:30.932
and I want you all to know,
right here and right now,

06:31.015 --> 06:32.892
I am taking a stand.

06:32.975 --> 06:35.937
-I am on... your side!
-[applause]

06:36.521 --> 06:38.648
-What side is that, specifically?
-Good question.

06:38.731 --> 06:41.818
I am specifically
on the side of the facts,

06:41.901 --> 06:44.529
and also on the side of feelings.

06:44.612 --> 06:46.322
-[cheers and applause]
-Well, I'm satisfied.

06:46.405 --> 06:49.450
Oh, excuse me,
would Mr. Peanutbutter

06:49.534 --> 06:52.829
be willing to sign this letter
to our state government?

06:52.912 --> 06:55.039
Yes. I'll write his name on anything.

06:55.123 --> 06:56.541
Oh, thank you so much.

06:57.667 --> 07:00.878
[gasps] And down goes Todd.

07:02.213 --> 07:03.464
And up comes Todd!

07:04.257 --> 07:05.424
Aah! [grunting]

07:05.508 --> 07:06.717
-Whoa!
-Stay back!

07:06.801 --> 07:08.469
Calm down, I'm not going to hurt you.

07:08.553 --> 07:11.931
My name is Hollyhock Manheim-Mannheim
Guerrero-Robinson-Zilberschlag

07:12.014 --> 07:14.475
-Hsung-Fonzerelli-McQuack.
-Wait, wait, wait.

07:14.559 --> 07:16.727
-What's your first name?
-Hollyhock.

07:16.811 --> 07:18.146
And your last name?

07:18.229 --> 07:21.774
Manheim-Mannheim-Guerrero-Robinson-
Zilberschlag-Hsung-Fonzerelli-McQuack.

07:21.858 --> 07:23.359
Got it.

07:23.443 --> 07:25.945
-Wait, what's your last name?
-I know, it's confusing.

07:26.028 --> 07:28.865
-I have eight dads.
-How'd that happen? Test tubes?

07:28.948 --> 07:31.367
-No. I was adopted.
-Oh, of course.

07:31.451 --> 07:34.454
By eight men in a committed gay
polyamorous relationship.

07:34.537 --> 07:37.623
-Less of course.
-But ever since I was a baby,

07:37.707 --> 07:40.877
people always said I looked like
BoJack Horseman.

07:40.960 --> 07:43.421
-That's a terrible thing to say to a baby!
-[skimmer clatters]

07:43.504 --> 07:48.509
And I've always wondered if BoJack
could be my biological... sperm guy.

07:48.593 --> 07:50.720
I guess it's possible.

07:50.803 --> 07:54.223
BoJack used to say his penis
is like sun-dried tomatoes:

07:54.307 --> 07:57.560
back in the '90s it got into everything.

07:57.643 --> 07:59.729
I came to L.A.
to get to the bottom of things.

07:59.812 --> 08:02.690
I even bought a deluxe spy kit.
Sorry about knocking you out.

08:02.773 --> 08:05.109
Once you have chloroform,
you can't <i>not</i> use it.

08:05.193 --> 08:07.778
No, I get it. BoJack had one
of those spy kits, too.

08:07.862 --> 08:10.698
He mostly just used the chloroform
on himself, though.

08:10.781 --> 08:13.159
I read in his book that you live together.

08:13.242 --> 08:16.287
-Can you help me find him?
-Sorry. I don't live there anymore.

08:16.370 --> 08:18.789
And no one knows where he's been
for the last year.

08:18.873 --> 08:20.625
I guess I don't have to meet him.

08:20.708 --> 08:24.378
All I need is a DNA sample,
like a piece of hair or something.

08:24.462 --> 08:26.839
-I guess his house might have-- [gasps]
-[grunts]

08:27.882 --> 08:30.593
-Whoa!
-Sorry again. It's just so fun.

08:30.676 --> 08:33.596
Okay, there might be some hairs
in the shower drain,

08:33.679 --> 08:35.806
but hard to know who they belong to.

08:35.890 --> 08:40.728
Everyone who has sex with BoJack
usually takes a <i>long </i>shower afterwards.

08:40.811 --> 08:43.397
-Hey, I think I see a hair.
-[moaning]

08:43.481 --> 08:45.399
Oh, no, BoJack.

08:45.483 --> 08:47.568
-Yoink!
-What the... was...

08:48.694 --> 08:50.488
-[exhales] Okay.
-Okay, let's blow.

08:50.571 --> 08:53.324
Blow? Who's got blow?
Save some for BoJack. [groans] Huh?

08:53.407 --> 08:56.661
Wait, Todd? Oh, shit. Are you gonna
yell at me? Can I have the blow first?

08:56.744 --> 09:00.665
No. BoJack, there's no blow, okay?
And I'm not going to yell at you.

09:00.748 --> 09:01.666
And what is this?

09:01.749 --> 09:04.544
I'm Hollyhock Manheim-Mannheim-
Guerrero-Robinson-

09:04.627 --> 09:06.796
Zilberschlag-Hsung-Fonzerelli-McQuack.

09:06.879 --> 09:09.006
Of the New Haven
Manheim-Mannheim-Guerrero-Robinson-

09:09.090 --> 09:10.758
Zilberschlag-Hsung-Fonzerelli-McQuacks?

09:10.841 --> 09:14.720
That was a joke. Obviously, I've never
heard of your family and/or law firm.

09:15.721 --> 09:18.891
That was also a joke. Todd, who is
this tough crowd you brought to my home?

09:18.975 --> 09:21.936
-Um, BoJack, this is your daught...
-Mm-mmm, mm-mmm!

09:22.019 --> 09:24.647
...dot-dot maid.

09:24.730 --> 09:26.190
Way to build up the suspense.

09:26.274 --> 09:28.776
To, uh, tidy up the place
in case you came back.

09:28.859 --> 09:30.486
You got me a maid? Thank you.

09:30.570 --> 09:32.488
Here I thought Channing Tatum
was a good neighbor

09:32.572 --> 09:34.198
for picking up my mail while I was gone,

09:34.282 --> 09:36.617
but you, and after all the things
I did to you,

09:36.701 --> 09:40.371
-I don't know how to tell you--
-BoJack, we haven't talked in like a year,

09:40.454 --> 09:42.665
and that's actually been
kind of working for me.

09:42.748 --> 09:46.669
So, maybe it's better if we just
keep things like that, you know?

09:46.752 --> 09:49.589
-Oh. Okay. So then why did you hire me--
-[grunts]

09:49.672 --> 09:51.340
Oh, yeah, deliver me.

09:52.008 --> 09:54.468
You're welcome.
Now go get that DNA tested.

09:54.552 --> 09:57.513
[panting]

09:57.597 --> 09:59.181
Can you tell me if this is a match?

09:59.265 --> 10:01.934
-A match with who?
-Hollyhock.

10:02.018 --> 10:07.648
Manheim-Mannheim-Gorilla-Rub-a-Dub-Dub
Zoolander-Hallelujah-something-McDonald's?

10:07.732 --> 10:10.192
Whatever those words are,
I need a sample from her, too.

10:10.276 --> 10:12.069
[groans] Duh!

10:12.153 --> 10:14.071
Bring it in an hour.
I gotta get to lunch.

10:14.155 --> 10:16.490
Nothing like working
with hair, blood, and semen all day

10:16.574 --> 10:18.868
to work up an appetite,
and it's already 1:00.

10:18.951 --> 10:21.579
1:00?
I gotta go meet my fake girlfriend!

10:21.662 --> 10:23.456
Oh, you have a fake girlfriend too?

10:23.539 --> 10:26.208
Mine is a bunch of water balloons
with a blonde wig.

10:28.461 --> 10:30.630
I suppose a fancy restaurant like this

10:30.713 --> 10:33.132

such as yourself.

10:33.215 --> 10:34.175
No, it's fine.

10:34.258 --> 10:37.178
You'd probably like to take me
someplace rough and primitive.

10:37.261 --> 10:39.805
Uh... do you want me to take you
somewhere else?

10:39.889 --> 10:44.226
Well, if you must drag me on some
barbaric adventure, I can't stop you.

10:44.310 --> 10:46.729
There's a Pony Roma's
at Universal CityWalk.

10:46.812 --> 10:48.898
A chain restaurant?
Oh, God, no, I'll be mugged.

10:48.981 --> 10:50.107
I can't do this.

10:50.191 --> 10:52.860
Todd, I can never be
your dirty peasant girl, I'm sorry.

10:52.943 --> 10:54.904

-Did you clean anything?
-No.

11:20.679 --> 11:24.225
But I am learning so much
about my possibly-maybe birth father.

11:24.308 --> 11:27.186
Like, did you know he has a shoebox
in his closet full of bad reviews

11:27.269 --> 11:28.896
for other people's TV shows?

11:28.979 --> 11:32.191
So all you've done so far
is snoop around?

11:32.274 --> 11:36.320
I also ate a box of donuts,
got sleepy and took a nap.

11:36.404 --> 11:38.697
Yeah, I'm not sure we really need
to do this DNA test.

11:38.781 --> 11:40.491
Look, I didn't come all this way

11:40.574 --> 11:43.035
to not find out
who my biological father is.

11:43.119 --> 11:46.664
Okay, fine, then I just need you
to yank out a strand of hair

11:46.747 --> 11:50.418
-so I can take it down to the lab.
-No way! That sounds painful.

11:50.501 --> 11:52.420
-Can't we just use your hair?
-Um...

11:52.503 --> 11:53.629
-No.
-[panting]

11:53.712 --> 11:57.716
No, but I can pull out some of my hair
at the same time,

11:57.800 --> 12:00.719
-so you don't have to do it alone.
-Okay, that sounds fair.

12:00.803 --> 12:01.929
On three, we pull.

12:02.012 --> 12:04.557
-One... two... three!
-Ow!

12:04.640 --> 12:08.269
Oh, wait, I have this whole comb
full of hair in my bag.

12:08.352 --> 12:09.645

12:12.022 --> 12:14.817
This maid is the worst.
I passed out again for some reason.

12:14.900 --> 12:17.236
When I woke up, the house
was messier than when she started.

12:17.319 --> 12:19.280
I don't mind someone else
in the house with me,

12:19.363 --> 12:22.116
in case I start choking on pills
or have a funny take on current events

12:22.199 --> 12:25.161
that demands an audience, but if she
can't do her job, I gotta fire her.

12:25.244 --> 12:28.122
You can't do that!
Here, buzz up real nice,

12:28.205 --> 12:32.084
take a nap, and while you're sleeping,
I'll get the maid to clean

12:32.168 --> 12:34.462
so no one has to fire anyone.

19:56.612 --> 19:59.323
-[Diane] Hello? Anybody home?
-Get down! Go, go, go! Shh.

19:59.406 --> 20:01.241
[Diane] I can hear someone in there.
Channing?

20:01.325 --> 20:04.119
Jenna Dewan?
Their daughter, Everly Elizabeth?

20:04.203 --> 20:07.122
Uh, it's me... [deep breath]
Channing Tatum.

20:07.206 --> 20:09.833
I'm in the middle of, uh,
channing right now,

20:09.917 --> 20:13.003
but you can come back... tatum?

20:13.086 --> 20:15.088
Listen, I'm a reporter.

20:15.172 --> 20:18.133
I tested your DNA
against another sample's DNA,

20:18.217 --> 20:19.927
and apparently the two are related.

20:20.010 --> 20:22.137
-You're a father.
-Wait, what?

20:22.221 --> 20:24.306
-Okay. Thanks!
-Todd.

20:24.389 --> 20:27.517
I was going to write a story
and drag your name through the mud

20:27.601 --> 20:31.396
just because I thought a couple more
people would click on an article I wrote.

20:31.480 --> 20:35.025
But I don't think that's
the kind of journalist I want to be.

20:35.108 --> 20:37.986
Maybe I'm not cut out
for this line of work.

20:38.070 --> 20:39.279
Sorry to bother you.

20:39.363 --> 20:40.822
Uh... [deep breath]

20:40.906 --> 20:44.743
[in lower voice] Hey, I obviously don't
know you because I am Channing Tatum,

20:44.826 --> 20:47.496
the guy from <i>Green Lantern</i>
or whatever,

20:47.579 --> 20:50.457
and you are a nobody,
but you came all the way over here

20:50.540 --> 20:53.085
to warn me about something
you hadn't even written yet.

20:53.168 --> 20:55.712
You ask me, movie star Channing Tatum,

20:55.796 --> 20:59.591
I'd say you're exactly the kind
of journalist we need in this world.

20:59.675 --> 21:00.759
Wow!

21:00.842 --> 21:04.346
That doesn't sound at all
like Channing Tatum's voice,

21:04.429 --> 21:08.642
but that <i>is </i>the kind of thing I would want
Channing Tatum to say to me,

21:08.725 --> 21:10.602
so thanks, Channing.

21:10.686 --> 21:11.853
Love half your movies!

21:11.937 --> 21:14.648
[sighs] That was a close one,
huh, Hollyhock?

21:15.232 --> 21:17.526
-Hollyhock?
-[ringtone] <i>♪ To-To-To-Todd! ♪</i>

21:17.609 --> 21:19.444
Todd's phone. What do you want?

21:19.528 --> 21:22.364
So, I see lots of pictures of you
at the fashion show,

21:22.447 --> 21:25.325
-but none of you with Courtney.
-Oh, crap!

21:25.409 --> 21:27.494
[grunting, panting]

21:27.577 --> 21:28.870
-Hi.
-Oh, hello.

21:28.954 --> 21:30.914
Uh, why are you wearing my clothes?

21:30.998 --> 21:35.419
These aren't anything like your clothes.
This hat alone cost $50,000.

21:35.502 --> 21:39.506
Oh. So, uh...
what's it like being a movie star?

21:39.589 --> 21:41.049
It's awfully trying.

21:41.133 --> 21:43.635
Do you ever feel like
everyone's looking at you

21:43.719 --> 21:47.014
-but nobody sees you?
-Yeah, that's exactly how I feel.

21:47.097 --> 21:50.350
No, I was speaking rhetorically
about a feeling that only movie stars get.

21:50.434 --> 21:51.393
Ohh.

21:51.476 --> 21:53.812
-Okay.
-But it feels good to talk about it.

21:53.895 --> 21:55.981
Yeah. Talking's good.

21:56.064 --> 21:59.192
You know, there was a meeting
I was supposed to go to tonight,

21:59.276 --> 22:02.070
but I don't think I'm gonna go.
I don't know if I'm ready.

22:02.154 --> 22:03.071
Ready for what?

22:03.155 --> 22:05.991
What if it's not everything
I want it to be?

22:06.074 --> 22:09.995
Sometimes the idea of something
is better than the truth, you know?

22:10.078 --> 22:12.956
I always prefer fiction to truth,
personally.

22:13.040 --> 22:14.541
I've staked my career on it.
[chuckles]

22:14.624 --> 22:16.376
Yeah, that makes sense.

22:16.460 --> 22:18.295
-Ha hah!
-Smile for the birdie.

22:18.378 --> 22:20.881
Hey, Courtney, you canoodling
with a supermodel now?

22:20.964 --> 22:22.507
-That's right.
-Fancy.

22:22.591 --> 22:24.843
I love how not down-to-earth
you are together.

22:24.926 --> 22:27.929
This is going to really make headlines
when you two break up.

22:28.013 --> 22:31.433
Here's an even bigger headline:
we shan't be breaking up.

22:31.516 --> 22:33.602
-We're engaged!
-Wowee!

22:33.685 --> 22:36.563
Hooray! I'm confused!

22:38.273 --> 22:40.901
Hollyhock? Are you here?

22:40.984 --> 22:43.528
No, but BoJack, who lives here, is here.

22:43.612 --> 22:46.323
BoJack, I gotta tell you, um...

22:47.282 --> 22:49.534
-Hollyhock is your daughter.
-What do you mean?

22:49.618 --> 22:51.286
-She's your daughter.
-I don't understand.

22:51.370 --> 22:53.789
She has Horseman DNA.
You're her father.

22:53.872 --> 22:55.040
That's impossible. I'm BoJack.

22:55.123 --> 22:59.377
She didn't want me to tell you,
but I thought you should know.

23:00.045 --> 23:02.672
I guess I don't blame her.
I wouldn't want to be my daughter either.

23:02.756 --> 23:03.590
BoJack...

23:03.673 --> 23:05.759
Look what I do to people
I'm supposed to care about.

23:05.842 --> 23:08.845
I had sex with the one person
I've ever seen you be in love with.

23:08.929 --> 23:11.973
I guess they're not gonna put you
in the best friends hall of fame,

23:12.057 --> 23:14.434
but I don't know that I loved her.

23:14.518 --> 23:16.269
I don't think I'm allowed to be in love.

23:16.353 --> 23:18.688
Don't say that.
You do so much for everybody.

23:18.772 --> 23:20.649
All you ever asked for
was a roof over your head

23:20.732 --> 23:22.317
and the occasional s'more in a baguette.

23:22.400 --> 23:24.861
I'm telling you,
it's a million-dollar idea.

23:24.945 --> 23:26.655
I got more of you than I ever deserved.

23:26.738 --> 23:28.865
If you never talk to me again
I just want you to know

23:28.949 --> 23:31.952
that I appreciate it,
and I appreciate you.

23:32.035 --> 23:33.495
-Thanks.
-[sipping]

23:33.578 --> 23:37.249
It was shitty
what you did with Emily, but, um...

23:37.332 --> 23:41.837
I think I'm... asexual.

23:41.920 --> 23:44.464
A sexual what? Dynamo, deviant?

23:44.548 --> 23:46.216
Harassment lawsuit waiting to happen?

23:46.299 --> 23:49.678
No. Asexual, not sexual.

23:49.761 --> 23:50.679
Ohh.

23:50.762 --> 23:54.141
-I'm sure you think that's weird.
-Are you kidding? That's amazing.

23:54.224 --> 23:56.143
Sometimes I wish I was asexual.

23:56.226 --> 23:58.270
Maybe then I wouldn't have
<i>a </i>strain of herpes.

23:58.353 --> 23:59.980
-You have multiple strains--
-I know.

24:00.063 --> 24:01.356
The joke only works with the "a".

24:01.439 --> 24:04.985
It actually feels nice
to finally say it out loud.

24:05.068 --> 24:07.362
I am an asexual person.

24:07.445 --> 24:10.282
-I am asexual.
-That's great.

24:10.365 --> 24:12.701
So if you're not mad about Emily--

24:12.784 --> 24:15.579
It wasn't just Emily, BoJack,

24:15.662 --> 24:18.707
and I don't know if I'm ready for us
to be friends again yet.

24:18.790 --> 24:21.877
-Oh. Okay.
-But we can be more than not-friends.

24:21.960 --> 24:23.336
You know, for an asexual,

24:23.420 --> 24:26.381
more than not-friends is probably
as good as it gets, right?

24:26.464 --> 24:28.967
I'm not really at a place yet
where I want to joke about it.

24:29.050 --> 24:32.429
-Got it, got it, totally.
-But it feels good to talk about it.

24:32.512 --> 24:34.723
Well, if you ever need a place to crash,
that couch--

24:34.806 --> 24:36.558
-I'm gonna go.
-Oh.

24:36.641 --> 24:38.852
-Right now?
-Welcome back, BoJack.

24:38.935 --> 24:40.687
It's good to see you.

24:42.898 --> 24:44.316
Uh...

24:44.733 --> 24:45.609
Hmm.
