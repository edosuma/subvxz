Reports of property damage

00:22.290 --> 00:23.324

00:23.357 --> 00:24.358
Officials say the epicenter

00:24.392 --> 00:25.793
of the quake was approximately

25 miles east of the city...

Sorry about the...

00:45.713 --> 00:48.282
You know.

00:48.316 --> 00:50.418
It's a fear thing. It
happens whenever I'm scared.

00:50.451 --> 00:52.286
You know, like scary movies.

00:52.320 --> 00:53.687
Surprise parties.

00:53.721 --> 00:55.523
Boo! You know? Boing.

00:55.556 --> 00:56.824
What is it?

00:56.857 --> 00:59.427
What... what is it?
What are you talking about?

00:59.460 --> 01:02.296
Look, you know, we're
adults here, okay?

01:02.330 --> 01:06.234
My hard penis
was dug in into your leg.

01:06.267 --> 01:08.869
It's done.

01:08.902 --> 01:12.473
Mmm. No, I didn't feel that.
Nothing.

01:12.506 --> 01:14.842
No. Don't worry about it.

01:14.875 --> 01:17.178
Look, I got scared.

01:17.211 --> 01:19.447
It got hard.
My penis dug into your leg.

01:19.480 --> 01:22.250
It's not about you, okay?
Don't get weird about this.

01:22.283 --> 01:23.884
Bro, calm down. I would've
told you if I felt it.

01:23.917 --> 01:25.586
Did you feel the
earthquake, at least?

01:25.619 --> 01:27.255
Yeah, yeah. No, that...
I was there.

01:27.288 --> 01:28.789
There's no way you didn't
feel it, all right?

01:28.822 --> 01:30.491
Okay. What are you doing?

01:30.524 --> 01:32.326
Okay. Why are you...

01:32.360 --> 01:33.594
Just stop.essing against you?

01:42.436 --> 01:43.837
Nothing. No.

01:43.871 --> 01:45.339
ChMm-hmm.

01:45.373 --> 01:49.177
Are you digging drug tunnel?

01:49.210 --> 01:50.611
No, no, no, no. No.

01:50.644 --> 01:52.213
Yes. We kind of are. W-We are.

01:52.246 --> 01:53.347
I'm so sorry.

01:53.381 --> 01:55.483
Uh, are you doing that,
too, or...?

01:55.516 --> 01:57.351
Yes, I guess the earthquake
opened up the gap

01:57.385 --> 01:58.486
between our two tunnels.

01:58.519 --> 02:00.488
They're side by side.

02:00.521 --> 02:03.224
Is yours a sexy ladies
digger tunnel?

02:03.257 --> 02:04.758
No. I'm not digging.

02:04.792 --> 02:07.761
I'm... catering.

02:07.795 --> 02:09.363
You have catering?

02:09.397 --> 02:10.931
Si.

02:10.964 --> 02:12.600

Yeah.

03:30.611 --> 03:32.546
Yeah.

Yeah. So...

what are we looking for,

Oh, we're not looking
for anything. Okay?

03:42.756 --> 03:44.592
I'm looking for something.

03:44.625 --> 03:45.959
And I'm not gonna tell you
what that is, all right?

03:45.993 --> 03:47.295
Okay

03:47.328 --> 03:48.396
Oh, we're so clear.

Focus back in the game.

03:51.999 --> 03:54.001
Back in the game.

03:57.070 --> 04:00.007
If you give me a hint
as to what the game is,

04:00.040 --> 04:02.443
I could be more
focused on that game.

04:02.476 --> 04:04.612
I'm not gonna be able
to help you out with that.ike...

04:04.645 --> 04:05.879
No. Totally.

04:05.913 --> 04:07.448
Yeah. No.

04:07.481 --> 04:08.582
I get it, you know.

04:08.616 --> 04:10.351
You can't tell me.

04:10.384 --> 04:13.921
No, I could tell you,
but I don't want to.

04:15.756 --> 04:17.491
Okay.

04:17.525 --> 04:19.760
No, I get it, you... you know.

04:19.793 --> 04:21.862
But I co25 years of this.

04:21.895 --> 04:23.497
Right. Right.

04:23.531 --> 04:24.998
Never met No. like you.

04:25.032 --> 04:26.900
Okay. Okay.

04:26.934 --> 04:28.769
I mean, I could just tell you
the little stuff. You know,

04:28.802 --> 04:30.771
just the little,
run-of-the-mill stuff.

04:30.804 --> 04:32.640
You know, like, where the
bathroom is or whatever.

04:32.673 --> 04:33.907
You know, that's...

04:33.941 --> 04:35.776
So where's the bathroom?

04:35.809 --> 04:37.911
Oh, no. A-Actually, that
was a stupid thing to say

04:37.945 --> 04:40.047
'cause there's... there's
actually no bathroom here.

04:40.080 --> 04:42.916
We just... We pee in bottles,
and-- I'm sorry, that's gross.

04:42.950 --> 04:44.685
Isn't it? Sorry.

04:44.718 --> 04:46.854
Yeah, that's what we do.

04:46.887 --> 04:48.922
And you think I've never peed
in a bottle before?

04:48.956 --> 04:50.524
Um...

04:50.558 --> 04:53.927
I don't know what the
answer to that is.

04:53.961 --> 04:55.996
But you're thinking about it,
aren't you?

04:56.029 --> 04:57.865
Yes, you are.

04:57.898 --> 04:59.667
Yes, you are.

04:59.700 --> 05:02.403
You're thinking about
"How does she piss in a bottle

05:02.436 --> 05:03.837
without a dick?"

05:05.573 --> 05:07.675
You think I need a dick
to do what you do?

05:07.708 --> 05:09.543
You think I need a dick?

05:09.577 --> 05:13.414
No, no. You do not need it,
and I celebrate that.

05:13.447 --> 05:14.615
I think that's wonderful.

05:14.648 --> 05:15.816
"How does she do it?"

05:15.849 --> 05:17.418
YHmm?

05:17.451 --> 05:18.686
That's what you're thinking.

05:18.719 --> 05:20.087
"How does she do it?"

05:20.120 --> 05:22.022
What do you think,

05:22.055 --> 05:24.725
I push the seat
all the way back,

05:24.758 --> 05:27.661
then scoot my ass
up to the front,

05:27.695 --> 05:29.830
grab a big old jug,

05:29.863 --> 05:32.433
put it right next
to my big old puss,

05:32.466 --> 05:35.703
spread those knees,

05:35.736 --> 05:39.407
arch her back just right, and...

05:39.440 --> 05:41.709
:
there it goes, there it goes.

05:41.742 --> 05:43.577
Oh.

05:45.613 --> 05:47.981
It's like flicking a diamond
off the Grand Canyon

05:48.015 --> 05:50.551
and landing it
in a pot of gold.

05:54.622 --> 05:56.457
Does that make you
uncomfortable?

05:56.490 --> 05:58.158
MeYeah.

05:58.191 --> 06:00.528
But if Tolbeck were here, he
would probably be uncomfortable.

06:00.561 --> 06:01.862
Oh, you love

06:01.895 --> 06:03.697
to talk about Tolbeck,
don't you?

06:03.731 --> 06:05.433
I mean, he's-he's-he's going
through a hard time, you know?

06:05.466 --> 06:07.134
A little bit.

06:07.167 --> 06:09.837
'Cause, uh, there was a shooting
incident the other night.

06:09.870 --> 06:11.972
I don't know if you
Yeah, we all heard about it.

06:12.005 --> 06:13.574
eah.

06:13.607 --> 06:15.175
Yeah, well, he's in
therapy right now.

06:15.208 --> 06:17.478
You guys a couple of bike bumps?

06:17.511 --> 06:18.846
I'm not sure what that is.

06:18.879 --> 06:20.981
A two-for-one
Space Mountain voucher?

06:21.014 --> 06:22.683
A terracotta pot fountain,

06:22.716 --> 06:26.119
with a... with
an oscillating head?

06:26.153 --> 06:27.755
Hmm? Spinning right round.

06:27.788 --> 06:29.189
Right.round. Right round.

06:29.222 --> 06:30.958
Right round. I mean,

06:30.991 --> 06:32.860
the metaphors are a little
obtuse, but I-I think

06:32.893 --> 06:35.463
you're asking "are we gay
with each other?"

06:35.496 --> 06:37.164
Yes. That's what I'm asking you.

06:37.197 --> 06:38.799
No, we're not.

06:40.734 --> 06:42.069
We'll see.

06:46.807 --> 06:49.176
TOLBECK: Wow, I've, uh...
I've never done anything

06:49.209 --> 06:50.811
like this before.
s)

06:50.844 --> 06:52.212
Oh, it's okay.

06:52.245 --> 06:54.515
It's pretty easy.
I don't bite.

06:54.548 --> 06:57.985
You're just gonna
sit here and tell me

06:58.018 --> 06:59.920
everything you know about
the night of the shooting,

06:59.953 --> 07:01.589
just, in your own words.

07:01.622 --> 07:03.023
All right. Sounds good.

07:03.056 --> 07:06.026
Um, is it okay if I make myself
more comfortable?

07:06.059 --> 07:07.194
Oh, sure. Go ahead.

07:07.227 --> 07:09.663
Great.

07:11.031 --> 07:13.066
Yeah.

07:13.100 --> 07:14.201
Oh, yeah. This feels good.

07:14.234 --> 07:15.603
This feels better.

07:15.636 --> 07:16.804
Okay.nk we're all set.

07:16.837 --> 07:19.807
Okay. So, um, just...

07:19.840 --> 07:21.675
Mm-hmm.al easy, like I said.

07:21.709 --> 07:23.677
You're just gonna tell me
the events of the night.

07:23.711 --> 07:25.078
You Okay.

07:25.112 --> 07:28.248
It's little details I find, uh,
helpful as well.

07:28.281 --> 07:30.518
So, I guess you want to know
about the shooting.

07:30.551 --> 07:32.753
Well, uh, I guess
I should talk about

07:32.786 --> 07:34.555
what happened
during the day,

07:34.588 --> 07:36.824
um, 'cause it was, uh...
it wasn't a good day for me.

07:36.857 --> 07:38.659
I-I was pretty upset.

07:38.692 --> 07:41.094
Let me back up for
a second. I got into

07:41.128 --> 07:43.831
kind of a difficult discussion
with my wife Lisa.

07:43.864 --> 07:46.033
And, uh, Kyle was there,

07:46.066 --> 07:47.668
so you knowOh.w that goes.

07:47.701 --> 07:49.537
Is that

07:49.570 --> 07:51.238
Uh, no. Let me...
I should back up again.

07:51.271 --> 07:54.942
Kyle is a gentleman that
is living with me and my wife.

07:54.975 --> 07:58.178
And also,
he's having sex with her.

07:58.211 --> 08:00.648
So, um, yeah.

08:00.681 --> 08:01.782
Uh, we're in an open marriage.

08:01.815 --> 08:03.050
And so, that's great.

08:03.083 --> 08:04.718
Um, I really like it.

08:04.752 --> 08:06.720
It's really good for me and her.

08:06.754 --> 08:09.222
And, um... You know,
it's good for me

08:09.256 --> 08:12.259
because I could have sex
with anybody at any time.

08:12.292 --> 08:14.995
Uh, if you could just go ahead
and fast-forward

08:15.028 --> 08:18.566
to the events of the night
of the shooting.

08:18.599 --> 08:20.801
Okay, yes. The shooting.

08:20.834 --> 08:23.103
So, Lisa was saying that maybe
the open marriage

08:23.136 --> 08:24.972
could reinvigorate her.

08:25.005 --> 08:26.607
So, I thought
I'd give it a try.

08:26.640 --> 08:27.808
Oh, and I'm fine
with it.

08:27.841 --> 08:28.976
I'm fine.

08:29.009 --> 08:30.578
I'm totally fine with it.

08:30.611 --> 08:31.745
Okay, so you're fine.

08:31.779 --> 08:33.080
No, I'm not fine.

08:33.113 --> 08:35.616
You're right, I'm deflecting.

08:35.649 --> 08:38.285
I don't like having
another rooster in the henhouse.

08:38.318 --> 08:40.253
You know, I've never even
talked about this with Cullen,

08:40.287 --> 08:41.855
my partner.

08:41.889 --> 08:43.824
I'm trying to put on
this brave face of, like,

08:43.857 --> 08:45.125
"Oh, I like being
in an open marriage."

08:45.158 --> 08:46.293
But I don't like it.

08:46.326 --> 08:47.595
I'm gonna admit it.

08:47.628 --> 08:48.829
I do not lMm-hmm.

08:48.862 --> 08:50.831
And then, last week, you know,

08:50.864 --> 08:53.100
he asked me to pick him up
from the airport.

08:53.133 --> 08:54.702
Kyle.

08:54.735 --> 08:56.837
And I'm like, "Me pick you up?"

08:56.870 --> 08:58.271
And so,
we're in the car,

08:58.305 --> 08:59.907
driving from the airport,
and he's just, like,

08:59.940 --> 09:01.341
stretching,
and trying to get ready,

09:01.374 --> 09:02.843
like he's trying to get ready

09:02.876 --> 09:05.045
for some kind of
athletic competition.

09:05.078 --> 09:06.914
But I know
what he's getting ready for.

09:06.947 --> 09:09.883
I mean, man.

09:09.917 --> 09:11.184
How do I look to other people?

09:11.218 --> 09:12.853
I mean, I've told you
everything.

09:12.886 --> 09:14.354
Wha

09:14.387 --> 09:17.891
Do you see me as somebody
that you would even date?

09:17.925 --> 09:20.293
Well, I mean, maybe not me,

09:20.327 --> 09:23.263
but I have a cousin
who's got a wild streak.

09:23.296 --> 09:26.033
Yeah, well...
I'd like to meet your cousin.

09:26.066 --> 09:27.668
'Cause I can't meet anybody.

09:27.701 --> 09:28.936
This open marriage thing

09:28.969 --> 09:30.671
isn't working for me.

09:30.704 --> 09:32.806
It's working for her quite well.

09:32.840 --> 09:34.307
Could I just hear
more about

09:34.341 --> 09:36.677
just the shooting part?
Everything that...

09:36.710 --> 09:38.946
S-Starting with the shooting,
and ending...

09:38.979 --> 09:40.681
Oh, sure. You want to talk
about the shooting?

09:40.714 --> 09:42.215
I can tell you about that.

09:44.217 --> 09:46.086
So, it all...
you know, did I tell you

09:46.119 --> 09:47.688
that Kyle is building a yurt?

09:47.721 --> 09:48.989
Right.

09:53.961 --> 09:55.228
Gosh, I'm telling
you. I could,

09:55.262 --> 09:57.665
I could get used to this.
You know?

09:57.698 --> 09:59.800
What?

09:59.833 --> 10:01.669
The gangster life.

10:01.702 --> 10:03.103
Yeah, I get it.

10:03.136 --> 10:04.237
You get it?

10:04.271 --> 10:07.007
You get the gangster life now?

10:07.040 --> 10:10.911
So, when do I make my bones?
Hmm?

10:10.944 --> 10:12.846
What are you talking
about

10:12.880 --> 10:15.315
When do I pop my cherry?
Come on.

10:15.348 --> 10:19.853
God, I-I understand about
five percent of what you say.

10:19.887 --> 10:21.188
Kill a guy.

10:21.221 --> 10:23.857
When do I get to kill a guy?

10:23.891 --> 10:25.192
You want to kill a guy?

10:25.225 --> 10:26.727
I'm ready.

10:26.760 --> 10:29.396
I've said nothing to you
about killing a guy.

10:29.429 --> 10:32.332
Okay, well,
you-you-you get my gist.

10:32.365 --> 10:33.867
I don't know, I...

10:33.901 --> 10:35.268
Why didn't you just
say "kill a guy"

10:35.302 --> 10:37.270
rather than
"pop my cherry"?

10:37.304 --> 10:39.006
I saw a Frontline.

10:39.039 --> 10:40.774
I watch a lot of Frontline.

10:43.076 --> 10:47.848
That's not doing anything
to your hair, Adrian.

10:47.881 --> 10:50.450
There's so much gel
and hairspray in there.

10:50.483 --> 10:51.985
It's not even...
you're not even,

10:52.019 --> 10:54.387
you're hardly even
touching your hair.

10:58.091 --> 11:00.093
Do you want this?

11:02.095 --> 11:04.865
I'm wearing a hat.

11:08.068 --> 11:10.437
:
G'day, sheilas. Hey, heads up,

11:10.470 --> 11:13.874
there's a bloody great croc
in that billabong over there.

11:13.907 --> 11:15.475
Yo, uh, What is that?

11:15.508 --> 11:17.310
It's my accent.

11:17.344 --> 11:18.779
Yeah.t?

11:18.812 --> 11:19.980
Australian. where?

11:20.013 --> 11:22.182
AusOh. Oh, that...

11:22.215 --> 11:24.752
Yeah. I'm doing this, uh, play.
It's at this amateur theater.

11:24.785 --> 11:25.786
You're in a play?

11:25.819 --> 11:26.987
Yeah. Croc Man.

11:27.020 --> 11:29.056
It's the story
of Steve Irwin.

11:29.089 --> 11:30.991
Let me hear the accent again.

11:31.024 --> 11:32.192
G'day, sheilas.

11:32.225 --> 11:34.027
Heads up, there's
a bloody big croc

11:34.061 --> 11:35.929
in the billabong
No, no, no.

11:35.963 --> 11:37.197
No. You're way off.
That's not how you do it.

11:37.230 --> 11:38.231
Listen to how I do it.

11:38.265 --> 11:39.933
:
There's a bloody big croc

11:39.967 --> 11:41.201
over there in that billabong
over there.

11:41.234 --> 11:42.202
That was pretty good.

11:42.235 --> 11:43.470
Let's hear yours again.

11:43.503 --> 11:45.038
There's a bloody big croc
over there.

11:45.072 --> 11:46.339
There's a bloody big croc
over there.

11:46.373 --> 11:47.474
Bloody big croc
over there.

11:47.507 --> 11:49.309
There's a bloody big croc
over there.

11:49.342 --> 11:51.178
A pretty big croc
over there.

11:51.211 --> 11:52.946
Bloody big croc
Yeah, Australian.

11:52.980 --> 11:55.015
Tony, you're not even... You're
not listening to me, okay?

11:55.048 --> 11:57.017
TONY: There's a bloody
I'm trying to help you.

11:57.050 --> 11:58.418
Just listen to
what I'm doing.

11:58.451 --> 11:59.820
You're getting a free
lesson here, okay?

11:59.853 --> 12:01.421
There's a bloody big croc
over there.

12:01.454 --> 12:02.522
Bloody... there's
a bloody big croc over there.

12:02.555 --> 12:05.092
It's really all
over the place.

12:05.125 --> 12:06.960
Yeah, I could hear it
more... I actually can

12:06.994 --> 12:08.328
JANICE: Yeah.there.

12:08.361 --> 12:09.296
Cro-oc.

12:09.329 --> 12:11.231
Cro-oc.

12:11.264 --> 12:13.300
Cro-oc.

12:13.333 --> 12:15.435
Jesus Christ.

12:15.468 --> 12:17.504
Well, I-I have a big speech
in the second half.

12:17.537 --> 12:18.806
I couJANICE: Mm.

12:18.839 --> 12:20.473
Yeesh.

12:20.507 --> 12:21.541
JANICE:
Yeah, let's hear it.

12:21.574 --> 12:23.276
Okay.

12:27.380 --> 12:30.050
G'day, Steve.

12:30.083 --> 12:33.320
Mate, I've known you
since you're a kid.

12:33.353 --> 12:35.455
You're a bloody dreamer.

12:35.488 --> 12:38.058
I love you, Steve,
but there's no way in the world

12:38.091 --> 12:40.260
you're gonna get this zoo
across the line.

12:40.293 --> 12:42.395
I mean, the banks will never
give us money.

12:42.429 --> 12:44.131
This is the country we live in.

12:44.164 --> 12:45.565
You and me,

12:45.598 --> 12:48.001
we're never gonna get there.

12:48.035 --> 12:50.003
You got Buckley's.

12:50.037 --> 12:53.841
Give up.

12:53.874 --> 12:55.508
Boy, that was horrible.
FATIMA: Yikes.aught.

12:57.911 --> 13:00.881
FATIMA:
Sorry.uck.

13:00.914 --> 13:02.850
JANICE :
Stinky.

13:02.883 --> 13:04.151
Poor guy.

13:04.184 --> 13:05.785
Ooh! Pee-ew.

13:18.899 --> 13:22.035
Ay. Wow.

13:22.069 --> 13:24.137
Oh. my leg.

13:26.940 --> 13:29.042
Oh.

13:29.076 --> 13:30.610
Wow.God.

13:30.643 --> 13:31.611
I'm so sore.

13:31.644 --> 13:33.914
That was impressive.

13:33.947 --> 13:35.282
Oh, you mean that?

13:35.315 --> 13:36.984
Yeah. Yeah,
I guess so.

13:37.017 --> 13:39.119
Ay, you guess so?

13:39.152 --> 13:41.621
The soft lighting,
the rail system,

13:41.654 --> 13:43.891
the Wi-Fi. They had Wi-Fi.

13:43.924 --> 13:47.394
No, yeah, that was pretty...
that part was pretty cool, yeah.

13:47.427 --> 13:49.529
It looks like
they're down a man, too.

13:49.562 --> 13:51.331
You mean that poor cabrón
that was all crushed up?

13:51.364 --> 13:53.433
What a way to die, huh?

13:53.466 --> 13:54.902
That sucks for him.

13:54.935 --> 13:56.336
Yeah, he died
Yeah.horribly.

13:56.369 --> 13:57.637
I'm applying for that position.

13:57.670 --> 14:00.640
Y

14:00.673 --> 14:03.443
You-you love this tunnel...

14:03.476 --> 14:06.613
Yeah. I-I did.

14:06.646 --> 14:08.548
But that's a super
drug tunnel.

14:08.581 --> 14:11.418
This is a drug tunnel.
That's the big show.

14:11.451 --> 14:13.486
It's perfect
for my narrative

14:13.520 --> 14:16.323
of a stand-up comedian
digging his way

14:16.356 --> 14:19.659
: through a
super tunnel to America.

14:19.692 --> 14:21.161
I don't understand what
the difference is, though,

14:21.194 --> 14:22.662
between us and them.

14:22.695 --> 14:24.631
I can say, "Oh, I came here
through a drug tunnel."

14:24.664 --> 14:26.499
Or I can say,
"I came here

14:26.533 --> 14:28.435
"through a super drug tunnel,

14:28.468 --> 14:31.571
the one that was on CNN with
the pictures and the videos."

14:31.604 --> 14:34.641
Do you know how many
tunnels run under here?

14:34.674 --> 14:36.209
No. No idea.

14:36.243 --> 14:37.477
Like, A lot?

14:37.510 --> 14:40.247
This is the golden age
of tunnels.

14:40.280 --> 14:42.615
That's a big-time tunnel.

14:42.649 --> 14:43.984
Everybody knows
that tunnel.

14:44.017 --> 14:47.120
Ours is like a...
a fringe tunnel.

14:47.154 --> 14:49.990
I-I don't know, though, Roberto.

14:50.023 --> 14:52.259
Did you take a look at those
digger guys over there?

14:52.292 --> 14:54.527
Cabrón, they were jacked.

14:54.561 --> 14:56.229
You know, like huge.

14:56.263 --> 14:58.999
I don't think I've ever seen
a Mexican in that good of shape.

14:59.032 --> 15:01.301
Yeah, they were all like me.

15:01.334 --> 15:03.103
Uh, like you,

15:03.136 --> 15:06.006
sí, certainly,
certainly as big.

15:06.039 --> 15:07.140
You're as big as them.

15:07.174 --> 15:09.242
Yes.

15:09.276 --> 15:11.278
And strong.

15:11.311 --> 15:14.247
I would say you're, like,
strong in your own special way.

15:14.281 --> 15:16.683
Like what?

15:16.716 --> 15:19.652
Yeah, like, those guys
are more like, you know,

15:19.686 --> 15:24.257
very attractive, a beach body
sort of strong, you know?

15:24.291 --> 15:26.526
You're more like, uh...

15:26.559 --> 15:29.296
Carnaval. ¿Cómo se dice?
Is a carnival.

15:29.329 --> 15:31.131
Like a carnival strong.
There you go.

15:31.164 --> 15:33.033
Carnival strong?al...

15:33.066 --> 15:35.268
It's fat strong?

15:35.302 --> 15:37.404
Oh, fat strong.

15:37.437 --> 15:39.039
Fuck you.

15:39.072 --> 15:40.573
It's time to do
the carnival thing.

15:40.607 --> 15:41.708
Yeah.

15:41.741 --> 15:43.176
Body shamed underground.

15:43.210 --> 15:44.311
I don't need this.
That's why I'm leaving.

15:44.344 --> 15:45.745
Okay? If we were in
the super tunnel,

15:45.778 --> 15:47.314
I would report you

15:47.347 --> 15:49.349
because they have people
for that there.

15:56.223 --> 15:59.192
I guess I just think, you know,
y-you being here tonight,

15:59.226 --> 16:01.528
you know, from DEA, maybe
that's a good sign for me

16:01.561 --> 16:03.196
in terms of the case.

16:03.230 --> 16:05.198
Maybe the case is heating
up a little bit here.

16:05.232 --> 16:08.068
And I understand you,
you have confidential,

16:08.101 --> 16:09.736
uh, whatever,
but, you know,

16:09.769 --> 16:13.473
if you could just give me a
little scrap, that'd be great.

16:13.506 --> 16:15.608
Yeah, we're all kind of
in the dark on this one.

16:15.642 --> 16:16.709
I will not tell a soul.

16:16.743 --> 16:17.777
You have my word.

16:17.810 --> 16:18.778
I won't tell anyone.

16:18.811 --> 16:20.047
Wow, sugar.

16:20.080 --> 16:22.315
You got some balls on you.

16:22.349 --> 16:23.350
Well...

16:23.383 --> 16:26.486
I'm ambitious.

16:26.519 --> 16:30.090
You ticklish?

16:30.123 --> 16:31.591
No, I said I'm ambitious.

16:31.624 --> 16:33.793
And I said, "You ticklish?"

16:33.826 --> 16:35.795
Are-are-are... okay.

16:35.828 --> 16:37.364
So, you're saying
that if you,

16:37.397 --> 16:39.366
if I allow you
to tickle me, uh,

16:39.399 --> 16:41.234
y-you'll give me information
about the case?

16:41.268 --> 16:42.602
That's right.

16:42.635 --> 16:44.237
You give me
a little something,

16:44.271 --> 16:46.106
I'll give you
e something.

16:46.139 --> 16:48.208
But I need to know
that you want it.

16:48.241 --> 16:50.577
Well, I mean, that depends.

16:50.610 --> 16:52.779
Is-is-is it a-a
s

16:52.812 --> 16:54.247
Not for me.

16:54.281 --> 16:57.717
Right. But for me?

16:57.750 --> 17:00.520
Huh.n't know.

17:00.553 --> 17:04.124
Right. But it's just over the
clothes, no skin tickling?

17:04.157 --> 17:05.658
You know, you got
a lot of questions.

17:05.692 --> 17:07.594
You're kind of taking
the fun out of this.

17:07.627 --> 17:09.362
No, no. No, no, no, I-I want
to do it, I'm interested...

17:09.396 --> 17:10.630
If you want the intel,
you get the tickles.

17:10.663 --> 17:12.099
Right, and I want...
You want the tickles?

17:12.132 --> 17:14.101
Let me hear you say it.

17:14.134 --> 17:16.336
I want the tickles.."

17:16.369 --> 17:18.438
I want the tickles.."

17:18.471 --> 17:19.839
I want you...n it?

17:19.872 --> 17:21.441
Could you put a little
something into it?

17:21.474 --> 17:23.643
I want you to
Oh, you do?ow.

17:23.676 --> 17:25.278
Is that right?

17:25.312 --> 17:26.346
Like this?

17:26.379 --> 17:27.447
And one right there.

17:27.480 --> 17:28.515
You want one right there?

17:28.548 --> 17:30.450
Right there?
How about there?

17:30.483 --> 17:32.252
Does that tickle?
Does that tickle?Yeah.

17:32.285 --> 17:34.254
Right there. You like...

17:36.256 --> 17:37.857
You know what, you're not
even having any fun here.

17:37.890 --> 17:39.659
No, I'm not.

17:39.692 --> 17:41.828
I'm-I'm not actually
Everybody's ticklish.

17:41.861 --> 17:43.463
Maybe you just don't know

17:43.496 --> 17:45.232
where to be tickled yet.

17:45.265 --> 17:49.302
And maybe we find out...
together.

18:00.180 --> 18:03.883
Wow. Okay. All right.

18:03.916 --> 18:07.287
Now I'm getting it.
What?

18:07.320 --> 18:09.856
Oh, my goodness.

18:09.889 --> 18:14.194
Your mom... she's dynamite.

18:14.227 --> 18:15.595
She's a dynamite lady.

18:15.628 --> 18:17.330
Now I've, I'm fig...
I've figured out

18:17.364 --> 18:19.799
what she's got us
doing here.

18:19.832 --> 18:22.735
What? What has she
got us doing here?

18:22.769 --> 18:24.904
Well, you know,

18:24.937 --> 18:27.174
telling you
that I need work,

18:27.207 --> 18:29.176
and telling me
that you need help.

18:29.209 --> 18:31.478
She just wants us
to hang out.

18:31.511 --> 18:32.612
Yeah.

18:32.645 --> 18:34.581
Her two favorite boys.

18:34.614 --> 18:35.682
Spend some time together.

18:35.715 --> 18:36.883
'Cause let's face it--

18:36.916 --> 18:39.186
you haven't had any
great father figures.

18:39.219 --> 18:41.521
You realize my mom's
been married six times?

18:41.554 --> 18:43.356
Previously. Six.

18:43.390 --> 18:44.724
I had counted four.

18:44.757 --> 18:47.727
Six. I've had six
Six?dads before you.

18:47.760 --> 18:50.363
Well, they were all
No.dbeats, so...

18:50.397 --> 18:52.765
Not Mr. Yoshimoto.

18:52.799 --> 18:54.467
Yoshimoto.

18:54.501 --> 18:56.603
Yes. Chinese dude.

18:56.636 --> 18:58.905
No, he's a Japanese dude.

18:58.938 --> 19:01.708
What was so great
about Yoshimoto?

19:01.741 --> 19:03.376
I mean, you probably
wouldn't understand.

19:03.410 --> 19:05.712
Hit me. Just try me.

19:05.745 --> 19:09.449
He taught me
honorMm-hmm.ct...

19:09.482 --> 19:11.651
...dedication, everything.

19:11.684 --> 19:13.320
Yeah.s pretty special.

19:13.353 --> 19:14.887
Like this one time,

19:14.921 --> 19:19.859
I remember him saying,
coming in, out of nowhere...

19:19.892 --> 19:20.927
Right.

19:20.960 --> 19:22.862
I had actually already eaten

19:22.895 --> 19:25.665
a pretty big breakfast,
and he said,

19:25.698 --> 19:28.401
Yeah.x."

19:28.435 --> 19:29.902
"I'll make you a sandwich."

19:29.936 --> 19:32.805
But he never brought
me the sandwich.

19:32.839 --> 19:36.276
I waited for
a good three hours.

19:36.309 --> 19:38.878
It wasn't about the sandwich.
I didn't need a sandwich.

19:38.911 --> 19:42.415
I thought I did, but he
showed me that I didn't.

19:42.449 --> 19:43.550
What?ou...

19:43.583 --> 19:45.418
Are you still craving
the sandwich?

19:45.452 --> 19:47.654
'Cause I will make you
the sandwich.

19:47.687 --> 19:49.889
I won't leave you high
and dry like Yoshimoto.

19:49.922 --> 19:53.960
You're missing the entire
point of this story.

19:53.993 --> 19:55.428
But you know.

19:55.462 --> 19:56.796
that I will make you
a sandwich

19:56.829 --> 19:59.366
at the drop of a hat.

19:59.399 --> 20:00.800
And that's a promise.
And you know what...

20:00.833 --> 20:02.435
Do you want to know the
other, the other lesson

20:02.469 --> 20:03.836
that he taught me, Adrian?

20:03.870 --> 20:06.706
Silence. He didn't speak
to me for an entire month.

20:06.739 --> 20:07.974
Maybe he was just afraid
to talk to you.

20:08.007 --> 20:09.442
I'm not afraid to talk.

20:09.476 --> 20:10.710
He didn't speak
English very well,

20:10.743 --> 20:13.813
but there was a lesson
in the silence.

20:13.846 --> 20:14.847
He wanted me to sit...

20:14.881 --> 20:16.283
I will talk with you

20:16.316 --> 20:17.584
whenever you want
to have a conversation.

20:17.617 --> 20:19.319
I know that.
I know that.

20:19.352 --> 20:21.388
You can call me at 4:00 in the
morning, I pick up the phone.

20:21.421 --> 20:23.856
Hey,mm.

20:23.890 --> 20:26.593
speaking of Chinese,
I was watching this movie...

20:26.626 --> 20:27.994
Japanese.

20:28.027 --> 20:30.730
...this martial arts movie
called Fist Assassin.

20:30.763 --> 20:33.300
And it dawned on me
that they've taken out

20:33.333 --> 20:36.969
all the "hi-yah"
from the film.

20:37.003 --> 20:38.871
I mean, used to think
about whenever you'd watch

20:38.905 --> 20:40.006
a martial arts film, right,

20:40.039 --> 20:42.875
any time there was
a kick or a punch...

20:42.909 --> 20:44.477
or a roundhouse,
there was--

20:44.511 --> 20:46.346
it was always followed
by a "hi-yah."

20:46.379 --> 20:48.448
And now it's gone,

20:48.481 --> 20:50.016
and I can't
for the life of me

20:50.049 --> 20:53.886
figure out why
they phased it out.

20:53.920 --> 20:55.655
Maybe it's coming off racist.

20:55.688 --> 20:57.924
Hi-yah!

21:02.061 --> 21:04.464
ERIN:
So... the suspect pulled
what appeared to be a gun.

21:04.497 --> 21:06.466
You shot him in the ear,
and he ran, is that right?

21:06.499 --> 21:09.336
That's exactOkay.at happened.

21:09.369 --> 21:12.372
I have everything I need.
I'll just fill out a report.

21:12.405 --> 21:15.041
Okay. Wow, this was really
great, I got to tell you.

21:15.074 --> 21:16.843
Thank you so much.
I mean,

21:16.876 --> 21:18.911
I really got to do this
more often.

21:18.945 --> 21:20.680
Hey, um, can I get a hug?

21:20.713 --> 21:21.781
Uh, okay.

21:21.814 --> 21:24.384
Yeah.s.

21:24.417 --> 21:27.053
Thank you.

21:27.086 --> 21:28.788
A-And look, i-if you...

21:28.821 --> 21:31.391
if you don't mind
Mm-hmm.esting...

21:31.424 --> 21:34.394
...you might want
to consider maybe just,

21:34.427 --> 21:36.529
you know,
seeing a therapist.

21:36.563 --> 21:39.799
Just because, uh, there's
a lot of great ones.

21:39.832 --> 21:41.067
You could probably
get a referral

21:41.100 --> 21:42.669
from someone in
the department.

21:42.702 --> 21:44.337
I'm sorry, but isn't that
what you are?

21:45.838 --> 21:47.940
Uh, no.

21:47.974 --> 21:49.609
Then who are you?

21:49.642 --> 21:52.412
Yes. Who am I?

21:52.445 --> 21:57.049
I-I'm Erin Sanders.
I, I'm in Internal Affairs.

21:57.083 --> 21:59.786
I'm here to take your
statement and fill a report

21:59.819 --> 22:01.087
of your account
of the shooting.

22:01.120 --> 22:03.423
No, wait a second.
I already talked to IA.

22:03.456 --> 22:05.925
Yeah, Leon and I.

22:05.958 --> 22:07.660
We went deep sea fishing
together.

22:07.694 --> 22:09.061
You went deep sea fishing?

22:09.095 --> 22:12.064
Wow. He asked everybody.
You went?

22:12.098 --> 22:13.966
That's amaz... no.

22:14.000 --> 22:16.569
He... well, he quit,
he didn't really...

22:16.603 --> 22:18.638
Let's just say he didn't
fill out many reports.

22:18.671 --> 22:20.707
Okay, look, this is
not cool, okay.

22:20.740 --> 22:23.042
This is an invasion of privacy.
Do you understand?

22:23.075 --> 22:24.811
Okay, I guess that's my fault.

22:24.844 --> 22:27.079
I mean, why would you think
I was a counselor, though?

22:27.113 --> 22:29.582
Because everything about this
scenario screams "counselor."

22:29.616 --> 22:32.452
Look at the furniture
and the couch, and, you know,

22:32.485 --> 22:33.753
the way you dress,
the way you talk to me.

22:33.786 --> 22:35.422
Your-your hair.

22:35.455 --> 22:36.589
What's wrong with my hair?

22:36.623 --> 22:37.657
Your hair is in, like,

22:37.690 --> 22:40.460
a counselor bun-type style.

22:40.493 --> 22:42.729
You know,
it's up and messy.

22:42.762 --> 22:44.464
Why did you lay me
on the couch, then?

22:44.497 --> 22:45.698
You laid yourself on the couch.

22:45.732 --> 22:47.567
I mean, that was
the first thing you did

22:47.600 --> 22:48.601
when you came in here.

22:48.635 --> 22:49.836
What was I gonna do,
say no?

22:49.869 --> 22:51.170
This is not right,
you understand?

22:51.203 --> 22:52.705
I told you about when I was

22:52.739 --> 22:54.741
attracted to my sister
when I was 13.

22:54.774 --> 22:56.175
Do you think this was
a party for me?

22:56.208 --> 22:58.177
You think I'm having
a real good time over here?

22:58.210 --> 23:01.748
This was truly one of the most
awkward hours of my entire life.

23:01.781 --> 23:04.984
Which I think I handled
pretty well-- pretty well.

23:05.017 --> 23:07.186
Uh, you must think that
I'm a total nutjob.

23:07.219 --> 23:09.956
I don't think you're
a nutjob, okay.

23:09.989 --> 23:11.724
You know, if pressed,
I might say,

23:11.758 --> 23:14.561
"Hey, he's... pretty in touch
with his feelings.

23:14.594 --> 23:17.830
That's refreshing." Okay?

23:19.899 --> 23:22.134
So... do you want
to have dinner?

23:22.168 --> 23:24.036
Fuck n-no.

23:24.070 --> 23:25.805
I meant...

23:25.838 --> 23:29.509
I meant... Sorry,
I just meant to say no.

23:29.542 --> 23:30.810
Fine, well, thank you very much.

23:30.843 --> 23:33.045
Oh, and I don't want
any of that getting out.

23:33.079 --> 23:36.716
If I can get an attorney,
you will be hearing from him.

23:36.749 --> 23:39.652
So, seriously,
Definitely, definitely not.

23:39.686 --> 23:41.420
Like, I'd rather die.

23:44.156 --> 23:45.191
MAN: Have you heard
from Special Agent Lehmann?

23:45.224 --> 23:46.793
MAN 2:
Not tonight.

23:46.826 --> 23:48.628
But she thinks
this could be the exit point.

23:48.661 --> 23:50.663
MAN 1: Okay,
we'll give it some more time.

23:50.697 --> 23:51.931
She's got her own methods.

23:51.964 --> 23:52.965
MAN 2:
Copy that.

23:58.705 --> 24:00.540
So, is this happening?

24:00.573 --> 24:02.208
Is what happening?

24:02.241 --> 24:03.676
Don't be playing
No, no...aby.

24:03.710 --> 24:05.077
You've been giving me signs
all night long.

24:05.111 --> 24:07.680
Oh. Wow. I didn't mean
to give off signs.

24:07.714 --> 24:11.183
It's been a long time for mama.
And I'm hungry. Let's eat.

24:11.217 --> 24:12.552
I have a girlfriend.

24:12.585 --> 24:14.220
Yeah.ave a girlfriend?

24:14.253 --> 24:17.056
I'm so sorry, I should've said
something earlier. She's...

24:17.089 --> 24:18.825
She's-she's in
dispatch, actually.

24:18.858 --> 24:19.859
Oh, she's in dispatch.

24:19.892 --> 24:20.960
Janice?

24:20.993 --> 24:22.529
No, Fatima.
Uh, she's new.

24:22.562 --> 24:23.863
Younger?unger than...

24:23.896 --> 24:25.832
Nice, you gonna marry
that bitch?

24:25.865 --> 24:27.667
I mean, we've only had
one date so far.

24:27.700 --> 24:29.101
One date? One date,

24:29.135 --> 24:30.637
and you already call her
Well...rlfriend?

24:30.670 --> 24:31.838
You texting?

24:31.871 --> 24:34.073
Mm...ng?

24:34.106 --> 24:35.708
Uh...pics?

24:35.742 --> 24:36.943
I mean, has she sent you
her tits?

24:36.976 --> 24:40.680
No, no, not as of yet.
No, no.

24:42.715 --> 24:44.584
Sugar, I hate to tell you,
but that's a bad sign.

24:44.617 --> 24:46.653
Well, I respectfully
disagree.

24:46.686 --> 24:47.820
I think, you know,
as a detective,

24:47.854 --> 24:49.055
it's my specialty
reading signs,

24:49.088 --> 24:50.790
and these signs, to me,

24:50.823 --> 24:53.726
say this is... we're
in phase two, you know.

24:53.760 --> 24:55.261
We're-we're working it,

24:55.294 --> 24:57.263
we're-we're,
you know, vibing.

24:57.296 --> 24:58.731
We're on a frequency here.

24:58.765 --> 24:59.866
We're-- this is all
part of the dance.

24:59.899 --> 25:01.233
Mm-hmm.rt of the dance.

25:01.267 --> 25:02.735
But she's in dispatch?

25:02.769 --> 25:04.737
Okay. that's right.

25:04.771 --> 25:06.806
No-no-no-no, no-no-no,
no-no, no, no...

25:06.839 --> 25:08.841
Get your hands off. Hey!.

25:08.875 --> 25:12.745
Hey. Hi. Uh, Car 27.
Is Fatima on the line?

25:12.779 --> 25:15.748
Fatima here.
Go ahead, Car 27.

25:15.782 --> 25:18.851
Hey, Fatima, could you switch
over to channel three, please?

25:18.885 --> 25:20.286
Copy that, switching to three.

25:20.319 --> 25:23.756
Hey, Fatima, this is Special
Agent Bonnie Lehmann here.

25:23.790 --> 25:25.291
Look, Cullen's out of the car.

25:25.324 --> 25:27.293
Just have a quick question
for you.

25:27.326 --> 25:30.830
It's a little bit embarrassing,
but, um,

25:30.863 --> 25:33.032
man, we have been vibing

25:33.065 --> 25:36.636
all night and, um, he did
mention that the two of you

25:36.669 --> 25:38.638
have dated.

25:38.671 --> 25:40.773
And I was just curious,
is

25:40.807 --> 25:43.142
I mean, are you
boyfriend

25:43.175 --> 25:44.644
Any of that?

25:44.677 --> 25:46.012
Oh, my God, no.

25:46.045 --> 25:49.782
I have zero interest in him

25:49.816 --> 25:52.184
at all times.

25:52.218 --> 25:55.187
Okay. I mean, you're not just
playing coy, are you?

25:55.221 --> 25:56.789
Making him chase you.

25:56.823 --> 25:58.190
Doing the...
What do they call it?

25:58.224 --> 25:59.759
Doing the dance?

25:59.792 --> 26:01.060
You're not doing the dance,
are you, Fatima?

26:01.093 --> 26:03.930
Full disclosure:
I went on a date with him,

26:03.963 --> 26:07.800
and it was... a nightmare,
to say the least.

26:07.834 --> 26:09.201
Kind of a nightmare.

26:09.235 --> 26:10.937
I just wanted to be
up front with you.

26:10.970 --> 26:12.672
It was a little creepy.

26:12.705 --> 26:15.207
Okay. I'm going for it.

26:15.241 --> 26:17.243
Car 27 out.

26:18.978 --> 26:21.681
You're a detective, right?

26:21.714 --> 26:23.950
What did you detect from that?

26:23.983 --> 26:28.320
I, uh, detected, uh...

26:28.354 --> 26:31.257
I detected, uh...

26:39.732 --> 26:43.970
He has to come back.
They all come back.

26:44.003 --> 26:45.237
I'll be right here.

26:45.271 --> 26:47.106
* I couldn't find quiet

26:47.139 --> 26:49.108
* I went out in the rain

26:49.141 --> 26:50.843
* I was just soakin'
my head... *

26:50.877 --> 26:52.111
Oye,

26:52.144 --> 26:54.246
cabrón.

26:54.280 --> 26:56.783
So-so how-how-how'd
it go in there?

26:56.816 --> 26:58.718
So, when, job.

26:58.751 --> 27:00.119
when do they want you to start?

27:00.152 --> 27:02.021
Pretty much right now.

27:02.054 --> 27:05.925
Oh, man. So...

27:05.958 --> 27:07.126
I guess this is it, huh?

27:07.159 --> 27:08.728
I guess so.

27:08.761 --> 27:11.230
Come on.

27:13.132 --> 27:15.835
Good... hey.

27:15.868 --> 27:19.205
Oh... oh, you're scared, huh?
