WEBVTT

03:26.306 --> 03:27.642
- Sorry.

04:42.349 --> 04:42.984
Excuse me.

04:44.652 --> 04:45.853
Sorry to bother you.

04:45.887 --> 04:47.454
Yes?
- I'm lost.

04:47.487 --> 04:49.524
It's my first time in New York,
actually.

04:50.423 --> 04:52.693
I never rode a subway before.

04:52.727 --> 04:53.828
I got a little too excited

04:53.861 --> 04:55.096
when they announced Times
Square.

04:55.129 --> 04:57.799
So, I jumped off,
but left my bag behind.

04:57.832 --> 05:01.368
Had my phone, wallet,
everything in it.

05:01.401 --> 05:03.370
Wasn't even my stop.

05:03.403 --> 05:05.006
- I don't have any money, sorry.

05:05.039 --> 05:07.041
- Oh, God, no, I don't need
money.

05:08.375 --> 05:11.378
Actually, my ATM card, it's at
the hotel, with my computer,

05:11.411 --> 05:14.816
so I can do the whole "Find
my Phone" when I get back.

05:14.849 --> 05:16.717
You know, the Cloud?

05:17.718 --> 05:19.352
- What do you need?

05:19.386 --> 05:20.387
- Right.

05:21.388 --> 05:22.023
Can you help me?

05:25.626 --> 05:26.961
- First time in New York, huh?

05:26.994 --> 05:27.862
- Yeah.

05:28.796 --> 05:30.832
- More like, first time out of
the house.

05:30.865 --> 05:32.033
You need the East Side.

05:32.066 --> 05:33.701
- Can I get there walking?

05:33.734 --> 05:34.669
- Or light jogging.

05:34.702 --> 05:36.403
I don't know your rhythm.

05:36.436 --> 05:37.972
- That's called
mall walking, where I'm from.

05:38.005 --> 05:40.508
It's, like, huge in
my town.

05:40.541 --> 05:42.543
- Where you from, 1985?

05:43.544 --> 05:44.512
- You're funny.

05:45.478 --> 05:48.716
You do that dry wit thing.

05:48.749 --> 05:49.750
Very New York.

05:51.484 --> 05:53.721
- Go four blocks east
and you'll hit it, okay?

05:54.755 --> 05:56.691
- And which way is east?

05:57.592 --> 05:58.759
Kidding.

05:58.793 --> 06:01.762
I do dry wit, too.

06:11.739 --> 06:13.007
I'm not a complete idiot.

06:14.542 --> 06:15.843
I needed your help.

06:15.877 --> 06:17.545
You gave that to me, and
for that I thank you,

06:17.578 --> 06:21.649
but I never would've asked
if you weren't so beautiful.

06:21.682 --> 06:23.551
I mean, is that okay to say?

06:23.584 --> 06:24.852
I don't mean it, like,
offensively.

06:24.886 --> 06:27.088
I'm not objectifying you, I'm
just saying

06:28.689 --> 06:31.959
it was a pleasure to
receive your directions.

06:34.061 --> 06:35.428
Thought you should know.

06:37.732 --> 06:38.633
Heading east now.

06:42.003 --> 06:43.771
- Hey, mall walker?

06:43.804 --> 06:44.639
- Uh.

06:45.640 --> 06:46.507
Joshua.

06:48.809 --> 06:49.810
- You'll get lost.

06:49.844 --> 06:51.145
I'll show you.

06:51.178 --> 06:52.713
- Really?

06:52.747 --> 06:53.614
Oh, thanks.

06:55.850 --> 06:57.018
What's your name?

07:06.761 --> 07:08.629
- Haven't decided yet.

07:10.231 --> 07:12.033
- Dry wit.

07:29.784 --> 07:32.720
I, I, I, I, I think that's east.

07:41.762 --> 07:42.997
- I'm Veronica.

07:43.030 --> 07:44.198
I live upstairs.

07:45.967 --> 07:46.934
Wanna come up?

07:46.968 --> 07:47.868
- Yes.

07:48.836 --> 07:50.204
- Don't make me regret it.

09:19.960 --> 09:20.961
Want a drink?

09:22.096 --> 09:22.963
- Sure.

09:27.001 --> 09:27.935
You have any pop?

09:30.037 --> 09:30.938
Soda.

09:32.006 --> 09:33.841
Where I'm from we call it pop.

09:37.745 --> 09:38.879
Or is that illegal here?

09:41.849 --> 09:43.250
Didn't New York pass a ban?

09:44.752 --> 09:47.688
Or was that just Biggie size?

09:47.721 --> 09:48.823
- I have alcohol.

09:49.990 --> 09:53.227
Would you like alcohol or
should I get you a juicebox?

09:53.260 --> 09:54.962
- Alcohol is fine.

09:54.995 --> 09:56.063
I drink.

10:02.203 --> 10:05.339
So you live in a hotel?

10:05.372 --> 10:08.843
- My family owned the unit
when it was residential.

10:10.044 --> 10:11.846
They can never kick me out.

10:13.214 --> 10:15.816
Perks of being a true New
Yorker.

10:15.850 --> 10:17.852
- It's a really cool place.

10:18.819 --> 10:20.855
Like, vintage, huh?

10:22.356 --> 10:24.024
I mean, it's not dirty or
anything, just looks old.

10:25.392 --> 10:26.961
Lived in.

10:28.429 --> 10:30.030
Your place has character.

10:33.100 --> 10:34.001
- Sit down.

10:39.240 --> 10:41.709
You like whiskey?

10:41.742 --> 10:43.277
- I like everything,

10:43.310 --> 10:45.312
except watermelon and cucumber.

10:45.346 --> 10:47.982
But that's not what's happening
right now.

10:48.015 --> 10:50.151
What's happening right now is
whiskey.

10:51.886 --> 10:52.753
With you.

10:54.021 --> 10:54.889
Veronica.

10:58.359 --> 10:59.293
Cheers.

11:00.194 --> 11:01.061
- Cheers.

11:21.415 --> 11:22.716
Get up.

11:22.750 --> 11:24.285
- We're gonna do it on the
table?

11:26.253 --> 11:27.121
I said,

11:28.856 --> 11:30.124
"Get up."

11:32.092 --> 11:32.993
Walk.

11:36.964 --> 11:37.831
Move!

11:39.867 --> 11:40.701
Up!

12:03.190 --> 12:05.459
We can't have sex if you don't
want to.

12:05.492 --> 12:07.861
- I do, it's just so much right
now.

12:21.576 --> 12:24.878
- It helps if you really get in
there.

12:30.017 --> 12:31.318
Are you a virgin?

12:34.822 --> 12:36.090
You're pathetic.

12:37.958 --> 12:39.260
- Ah, the shirt stays on.

12:41.395 --> 12:43.130
- Get on the bed.

14:09.416 --> 14:10.284
Hello?

14:12.486 --> 14:13.387
Hey.

14:16.658 --> 14:17.559
Hello?

14:29.704 --> 14:31.305
- Junk mail?

14:31.338 --> 14:34.241
I swear, I get about 20
pounds of this shit a year.

14:34.274 --> 14:38.979
And I get a ticket if I don't
recycle, but this is okay.

14:40.280 --> 14:41.448
- I need to get going.

14:43.016 --> 14:47.087
- A flyer for an antique
mall in Rhinebeck.

14:47.121 --> 14:48.455
Where the fuck is Rhinebeck?

14:50.157 --> 14:52.359
- Like I said, I need to get
going.

14:56.698 --> 14:58.132
- Remind me?
- 800.

14:59.133 --> 15:00.502
- She's all business.

15:05.305 --> 15:06.206
- No wallet?

15:07.441 --> 15:11.245
- I left it on the
train with my cell and my bag.

15:12.346 --> 15:14.516
- But your ATM card is at the
hotel

15:14.549 --> 15:17.117
and your computer can "Find
Your Phone."

15:17.151 --> 15:18.620
- You remembered.

15:18.653 --> 15:20.120
- It's part of the job.

15:21.088 --> 15:23.357
- Well, that's nice.

15:23.390 --> 15:24.291
Thanks.

15:29.597 --> 15:31.999
Well, it was a pleasure to meet
you

15:33.367 --> 15:35.436
and do that.

15:37.337 --> 15:38.706
- Okay.

15:38.740 --> 15:41.141
- You know, it only
happens, like, once a year,

15:41.175 --> 15:44.478
for my birthday, which
is today.

15:44.512 --> 15:46.280
- It's good to treat yourself.

15:46.313 --> 15:48.315
- So, I guess that makes you my
present.

15:49.617 --> 15:51.351
- I'm not a present.

15:51.385 --> 15:53.287
I'm a person.

15:53.320 --> 15:56.190
- Oh, yeah, of course, I
didn't mean it like that.

15:58.726 --> 16:00.294
Now, I'm very sorry.

16:03.430 --> 16:04.498
I thought it was you.

16:06.233 --> 16:07.267
- Oh, my God.

16:08.736 --> 16:10.337
- I don't feel so good.

16:32.159 --> 16:33.060
- I'll call 911.

16:33.093 --> 16:34.161
- It'll pass.

16:34.194 --> 16:35.563
- You need a doctor.
- I don't.

16:35.597 --> 16:36.698
Go!

16:36.731 --> 16:38.566
- Your eyes are fucking
bleeding!

16:38.600 --> 16:39.601
- All right.

16:44.071 --> 16:44.739
Finally.

16:47.140 --> 16:48.543
- Joshua.

17:37.257 --> 17:38.158
- You stayed.

17:40.160 --> 17:41.863
- How are you feeling?

17:41.896 --> 17:43.463
- Like I'm levitating.

17:45.299 --> 17:46.300
Are these tarps?

17:46.333 --> 17:48.435
- It's all I could find.

17:48.468 --> 17:49.737
You an outdoorsy dude?

17:50.738 --> 17:53.575
- No, I had the walls done.

17:53.608 --> 17:55.208
The painter left them behind.

17:57.244 --> 17:58.111
Lucky me.

18:00.480 --> 18:02.750
- Oh, I hope you don't
mind, I made some tea.

18:04.184 --> 18:05.820
I think this it's mint.

18:05.853 --> 18:07.855
It's the only scent I
recognized.

18:09.657 --> 18:10.525
Want a cup?

18:12.727 --> 18:13.828
- Not now.

18:13.861 --> 18:15.429
I take some of that water,
though.

18:22.503 --> 18:23.538
- Be careful.

18:27.441 --> 18:29.209
- For my homies.

18:35.883 --> 18:40.888
Correct me if I'm wrong, but
didn't you just choke me out,

18:41.889 --> 18:42.790
punch me--

18:42.824 --> 18:43.925
- I did.

18:43.958 --> 18:45.292
- Judge my boner--

18:45.325 --> 18:46.460
- Or lack thereof.

18:46.493 --> 18:47.862
- This the same girl?

18:51.733 --> 18:54.869
You know, I appreciate it, I
really do.

18:57.204 --> 19:00.273
You shouldn't have stayed.

19:00.307 --> 19:02.577
- It's not every day you see
blood gushing

19:02.610 --> 19:04.579
from a man's eyes.

19:04.612 --> 19:06.581
I wanna see how this ends.

19:06.614 --> 19:07.481
- You will.

19:10.685 --> 19:12.520
- I have some aspirin in my
purse.

19:13.821 --> 19:14.789
- Uh...

19:14.822 --> 19:16.456
Another whiskey'd be better.

19:16.490 --> 19:18.793
- When you can get up on
your own, I'll pour you some.

19:18.826 --> 19:21.428
- So, what do we do
now?

19:22.396 --> 19:23.765
- I could read to
you?

19:23.798 --> 19:27.200
- Uh, it's mostly historical
books, biographies.

19:31.839 --> 19:34.341
- And "Anne of Green Gables"?

19:37.545 --> 19:38.546
- What can I say?

19:38.579 --> 19:40.280
I love a red-headed orphan.

19:42.016 --> 19:44.484
There's an Annie poster
around here, somewhere.

19:45.485 --> 19:46.353
Or not.

19:47.187 --> 19:50.257
The mind's a little fuzzy right
now.

19:50.290 --> 19:52.225
Eyes of blood and such.

19:53.427 --> 19:54.562
- Yeah.

19:54.595 --> 19:56.597
What was that about?

19:56.631 --> 19:59.433
- An allergic reaction, to the
saffron.

20:00.768 --> 20:01.769
- Huh?

20:01.803 --> 20:03.871
- The stuff you put in my drink.

20:03.905 --> 20:06.306
I didn't tell you what it was?

20:06.339 --> 20:07.709
- No.

20:07.742 --> 20:11.579
Your message said find the
vial behind the whiskey

20:11.612 --> 20:13.213
and pour it in your drink.

20:14.549 --> 20:16.651
- What did you think it was?

20:16.684 --> 20:18.452
- Not saffron.

20:18.485 --> 20:20.822
- It's an organic aphrodisiac.

20:20.855 --> 20:24.391
- Oh, well, if it's organic.

20:24.424 --> 20:25.727
- I won't take Viagra.

20:25.760 --> 20:28.328
It's like admitting you're
officially old.

20:28.361 --> 20:29.296
- How old are you?

20:30.363 --> 20:31.364
- 400.

20:32.066 --> 20:33.500
- What?

20:33.534 --> 20:34.702
- 40.

20:34.736 --> 20:38.371
Feels like 400.

20:38.405 --> 20:39.406
- Oh, that's right.

20:39.439 --> 20:41.475
Erm, happy birthday.
- Oh.

20:41.509 --> 20:43.243
Please, don't, it's too
depressing.

20:46.814 --> 20:48.381
Can I have that whiskey now?

20:49.349 --> 20:50.283
- Can you get up?

20:56.490 --> 20:58.492
- No.

20:58.526 --> 20:59.861
Next question.

21:01.028 --> 21:01.896
- Oh.

21:04.565 --> 21:05.933
I don't know.

21:05.967 --> 21:08.770
- Well, here's your chance
to ask a John anything.

21:08.803 --> 21:09.670
- Client.

21:10.705 --> 21:12.774
"John" feels too anonymous.

21:13.975 --> 21:16.476
- We wanna be anonymous.

21:16.511 --> 21:17.712
- You can trust me.

21:18.679 --> 21:20.882
I'm the keeper of many secrets.

21:22.083 --> 21:25.052
- Wow, you sound like a sexy
wizard.

21:26.419 --> 21:28.990
- Comic book culture has opened
up an entirely new market

21:29.023 --> 21:30.525
to me.

21:30.558 --> 21:32.026
- They save
up all their IT bucks

21:32.059 --> 21:34.962
to fuck a lady warrior?

21:34.996 --> 21:36.463
- Or damsel.

21:36.496 --> 21:37.565
Depends on the guy.

21:38.533 --> 21:41.502
Mainly, they wanna show
me their collections

21:41.536 --> 21:43.571
and play with my tits.

21:44.505 --> 21:45.673
They're sweet.

21:45.706 --> 21:47.775
They ask if I'm okay.

21:47.809 --> 21:49.677
Do we need a safe word?

21:49.710 --> 21:50.778
Do I want a drink?

21:51.712 --> 21:53.014
- Oh, like this?

21:53.047 --> 21:54.782
- Did we have a safe word?

21:54.816 --> 21:55.950
- It's whiskey.

21:57.585 --> 21:59.486
Please, geeks and dragons?

21:59.520 --> 22:00.621
I have earned it.

22:01.789 --> 22:03.456
- Okay.

22:03.490 --> 22:05.492
But I'm cutting it with water.

22:07.795 --> 22:08.796
- All right.

22:08.830 --> 22:10.064
You're the boss.

22:10.097 --> 22:12.399
- Ah.

23:57.071 --> 23:59.006
- Don't chug
it like an asshole.

24:06.747 --> 24:08.015
- Cheers.
- Never cheer twice

24:08.049 --> 24:09.517
in the same day.

24:09.550 --> 24:10.818
It disrespects the gods.

24:11.852 --> 24:13.020
- You're fucking with me.

24:13.054 --> 24:14.689
- Numerology?

24:14.722 --> 24:16.489
- Oh, God.

24:16.524 --> 24:18.893
- Numbers play a huge part in
our lives.

24:18.926 --> 24:21.729
Who are you, a mere
mortal, to praise yourself?

24:21.762 --> 24:22.964
You're not a creator.

24:22.997 --> 24:24.265
You're a creation.

24:24.298 --> 24:25.199
Know your place.

24:31.005 --> 24:32.807
I'm totally fucking with you,
man.

24:40.214 --> 24:42.116
- Are you an "aliens are real"
and

24:42.149 --> 24:45.653
"we have twins in an alternate
universe" kind of gal?

24:45.686 --> 24:46.787
- Aliens are real.

24:46.821 --> 24:47.755
I've seen the footage.

24:47.788 --> 24:48.856
- Okay.

24:48.889 --> 24:50.191
- But, no, to twinsies.

24:51.392 --> 24:54.295
I do think we have multiple
souls in our bodies, though.

24:54.328 --> 24:55.162
- Cool.

24:55.196 --> 24:55.997
Thanks for the sip.

24:56.030 --> 24:56.964
Bye.

24:56.998 --> 24:57.965
- No.

24:57.999 --> 25:01.535
Not me per se, it's just...

25:01.569 --> 25:02.203
I don't know.

25:03.904 --> 25:06.640
You believe in reincarnation?

25:06.674 --> 25:08.042
- Yes.

25:08.075 --> 25:09.744
- It's like that.

25:09.777 --> 25:11.178
We're born with different parts
of souls

25:11.212 --> 25:13.547
that make up our personalities.

25:13.581 --> 25:17.018
That's where instinct, deja vù,

25:17.051 --> 25:18.853
things like that come from.

25:18.886 --> 25:21.789
- So, if I have a mood swing,

25:21.822 --> 25:25.860
it's a dormant soul wanting
his "me" time?

25:25.893 --> 25:30.898
Or if I think I've met you
before, I actually have,

25:31.132 --> 25:35.703
400 years ago, at a
primitive family reunion?

25:35.736 --> 25:36.904
- Never mind.

25:36.937 --> 25:37.838
You don't get it.

25:38.706 --> 25:40.174
Oh, I get it.

25:41.275 --> 25:44.645
But I believe, no matter how
many souls we might have,

25:44.678 --> 25:46.680
we are born with a singular
vision.

25:47.314 --> 25:49.717
And when we find out what that
is,

25:49.750 --> 25:53.187
nothing and no one can stop us.

25:53.220 --> 25:54.121
Wanna hear mine?

25:56.323 --> 25:57.892
- Sure.

25:57.925 --> 25:59.894
- To finish this drink!

26:02.263 --> 26:03.931
- You're fuckin' weird, dude.

26:03.964 --> 26:06.700
- Coming from the chick with
extra souls in her, great.

26:10.671 --> 26:12.740
- What's with the red tubs in
your fridge?

26:13.808 --> 26:14.875
- Blood.

26:14.909 --> 26:15.776
Duh.

26:17.912 --> 26:19.346
- It's beet juice.

26:19.380 --> 26:22.049
Well, beet juice and kale
and some other bullshit.

26:22.083 --> 26:23.317
Vitamin crap.

26:23.350 --> 26:24.952
- You on a juice cleanse?

26:24.985 --> 26:25.820
- Nah.

26:25.853 --> 26:27.354
I hate food.

26:27.388 --> 26:31.725
Like, the actual selecting
and chewing and cooking of it.

26:31.759 --> 26:32.860
If I could take a pill, I would,

26:32.893 --> 26:36.297
but I can't, so I drink my
meals.

26:38.299 --> 26:41.202
- So, you're saying you don't
eat?

26:41.235 --> 26:42.803
- Not if I can help it.

26:42.837 --> 26:45.272
The only solid food I like is
popcorn.

26:45.306 --> 26:46.340
- Yeah, that was in there, too.

26:46.373 --> 26:47.708
- Yeah.

26:47.741 --> 26:49.110
When it's cold it lasts longer.

26:49.143 --> 26:51.679
Plus, I don't even have
the dishes to make a meal.

26:53.914 --> 26:56.183
- Maybe that's why your eyes
bled.

26:56.217 --> 26:57.918
You need to fucking eat.

26:57.952 --> 27:01.722
- I know what my body
needs, thank you very much.

27:01.755 --> 27:03.190
Solid food is not one of them.

27:10.931 --> 27:12.433
- What?

27:12.466 --> 27:14.168
- I need to ask you something.

27:15.436 --> 27:17.838
- We're having a good time,
right?

27:17.872 --> 27:19.140
- Sure.

27:19.173 --> 27:21.742
- Let that be enough.

27:21.775 --> 27:22.409
- Okay.

27:23.978 --> 27:26.981
Nah, I'm still asking.

27:27.014 --> 27:28.782
- And, here, I thought you were
different.

27:28.816 --> 27:29.984
- You don't know what I'm gonna
say.

27:30.017 --> 27:31.385
- Sure, I do.

27:31.418 --> 27:34.121
The same thing they all
ask: "Why do you do this?

27:34.155 --> 27:35.689
"Why are you a sex worker?

27:35.723 --> 27:36.991
"Let me help you."

27:37.024 --> 27:39.026
I hear this bullshit all the
time.

27:39.059 --> 27:41.729
- Dudes are concerned.
- No, they're not.

27:41.762 --> 27:42.997
They had the best sex in their
lives

27:43.030 --> 27:44.231
and they don't wanna keep
paying for it.

27:44.265 --> 27:45.966
- Mm, good point.

27:46.000 --> 27:48.135
- So they think they're
thoughtful with their kind words

27:48.169 --> 27:49.937
and somehow they're gonna
make me their girlfriend.

27:49.970 --> 27:51.405
Or maybe not their girlfriend

27:51.438 --> 27:54.942
but certainly a woman that
waits by the phone longing

27:54.975 --> 27:56.410
for their compassionate cock.

27:57.845 --> 27:59.046
Because that's what every woman
wants,

27:59.079 --> 28:00.714
to be valued by a man.

28:01.949 --> 28:03.851
I do it for the money.

28:03.884 --> 28:06.854
I like nice things.

28:06.887 --> 28:08.422
Why you like getting choked?

28:11.959 --> 28:13.861
- I like to disconnect.

28:13.894 --> 28:15.162
It feels better when I cum.

28:17.064 --> 28:18.866
You think love is overrated?

28:18.899 --> 28:19.767
- Love?

28:20.935 --> 28:21.802
No.

28:22.537 --> 28:23.337
Sex?

28:23.370 --> 28:24.205
Yes.

28:24.238 --> 28:25.239
- Really?
- Sure.

28:25.272 --> 28:27.408
It's an activity, nothing more.

28:27.441 --> 28:29.343
- Uh, like, mall walking?

28:29.376 --> 28:34.114
- No, like
crocheting.

28:34.148 --> 28:35.716
- Huh?
- Think about it.

28:36.551 --> 28:39.820
You do all this work with
the knots and the hooks,

28:39.853 --> 28:42.289
building up your stitches,
and the closer you get,

28:42.323 --> 28:43.991
the more excited you become.

28:44.024 --> 28:46.293
And you work harder and faster,

28:46.327 --> 28:49.063
and when you finish,
you have this priceless,

28:49.096 --> 28:51.198
one of a kind experience you
created.

28:52.199 --> 28:55.069
And then you move on to your
next bag.

28:55.102 --> 28:56.237
That's all sex is.

28:56.270 --> 28:57.371
It's not love.

28:57.404 --> 28:58.906
It's a hobby.

28:58.939 --> 29:00.975
- So, making love, you
don't like that, either?

29:01.008 --> 29:02.309
- Mm.

29:02.343 --> 29:04.245
Ugh, I hate that phrase.

29:04.278 --> 29:05.279
It creeps me out.

29:05.312 --> 29:07.114
- "Celestial" does it for me.

29:07.147 --> 29:09.149
Ugh, what a wet word.

29:09.183 --> 29:10.351
"Celestial."

29:10.384 --> 29:12.019
Ugh, gross!

29:13.120 --> 29:14.255
- You're an idiot.

29:14.288 --> 29:16.056
- Making love is a beautiful
thing.

29:16.090 --> 29:18.792
- It turns an orgasm into an
obligation.

29:18.826 --> 29:21.095
Save the love for the important
stuff.

29:21.128 --> 29:23.797
- Hey, now, sex is important.

29:23.831 --> 29:25.399
- So is exercise.

29:25.432 --> 29:27.167
And voting.

29:27.201 --> 29:29.370
And eating solid foods.

29:29.403 --> 29:31.071
But to truly love someone?

29:33.173 --> 29:34.842
That's not sex.

29:41.315 --> 29:43.484
The only person I ever
loved was my grandma.

29:45.986 --> 29:47.454
And you?

29:47.488 --> 29:49.990
It's obvious the true love
of your life is your mother.

29:51.158 --> 29:53.227
Most men, it's the same thing.

29:53.260 --> 29:56.830
I take away their power,
make them feel inadequate

29:56.864 --> 30:00.000
and punish them for being bad
boys.

30:01.068 --> 30:02.269
Because their first crush was
mommy

30:02.303 --> 30:04.004
and they hate themselves for it.

30:05.372 --> 30:07.007
We fall in love with
the people who raise us.

30:07.041 --> 30:08.208
And we should.

30:08.242 --> 30:09.910
But don't let that cloud your
desires

30:09.943 --> 30:12.413
because you were taught sex
equals love.

30:12.446 --> 30:14.014
It doesn't.

30:14.048 --> 30:16.250
- Maybe that's the case
with your dragon dudes,

30:16.283 --> 30:18.185
but I don't wanna fuck my
mother.

30:18.218 --> 30:20.020
I want to save her.

30:21.355 --> 30:23.525
- I'm sorry, I didn't mean to
offend you.

30:23.558 --> 30:26.226
- Yeah, well, it's been an
unexpected day.

30:27.194 --> 30:28.329
Wait!

30:29.631 --> 30:31.398
- I should go.

30:32.499 --> 30:33.901
- I'll be right back.

30:39.373 --> 30:40.908
You're too early!

30:40.941 --> 30:42.544
- I wrote it down in the book.

30:42.577 --> 30:44.011
Two o'clock.

31:11.405 --> 31:12.906
- I told you I'd be right back!

31:48.976 --> 31:49.611
I'm that boring?

31:51.145 --> 31:52.614
- What's going on?

31:52.647 --> 31:53.480
- You tell me.

31:53.515 --> 31:55.082
You fell asleep.

31:58.419 --> 31:59.621
I mean, I get it.

31:59.654 --> 32:03.023
Dudes talk about mom, chicks
check out.

32:03.056 --> 32:05.159
But full on dream time?

32:05.192 --> 32:06.059
Ouch!

32:10.197 --> 32:11.331
- Someone else was here.

32:13.367 --> 32:14.602
- Yeah, my aunt.

32:14.636 --> 32:15.670
She thought I was at work.

32:15.703 --> 32:16.638
She let herself in.

32:18.205 --> 32:21.275
She went on vacation and
borrowed my suitcase.

32:23.343 --> 32:25.145
- But I heard yelling.

32:25.179 --> 32:27.014
- I'm sure you did.

32:27.047 --> 32:28.282
I used this suitcase once.

32:28.315 --> 32:31.051
It's got fucking baglady wear
and tear.

32:31.084 --> 32:33.555
There was yelling, for sure.

32:35.523 --> 32:36.691
- No.

32:36.724 --> 32:39.393
Someone else was here in this
room.

32:39.426 --> 32:41.161
- Just us.

32:41.195 --> 32:42.530
I don't even have a roommate.

32:43.430 --> 32:45.332
Was it the numerology gods?

32:45.365 --> 32:46.500
Ooh.

32:54.041 --> 32:55.442
- You hear that?

33:07.221 --> 33:08.656
- It's me.

33:08.690 --> 33:10.758
Well, not me, my favorite show.

33:12.159 --> 33:14.461
Favorite's pushing it,
but I love true crime.

33:16.598 --> 33:18.800
I'm watching "Second Marriage
Murders."

33:18.833 --> 33:20.434
- What?

33:20.467 --> 33:22.169
- I didn't wanna wake you.

33:22.202 --> 33:24.304
Guess I gave you nightmares
instead.

33:25.472 --> 33:26.373
Sorry.

33:28.342 --> 33:32.379
I also like "Housewife
Horrors," "Killer Nurses,"

33:32.412 --> 33:34.114
most reenactment shows.

33:34.782 --> 33:36.450
Usually, the man is up to no
good

33:36.483 --> 33:38.452
and the woman's out for revenge.

33:40.087 --> 33:42.524
I'm stuck in a black
widow spiral right now.

33:42.557 --> 33:45.192
I'm watching one where
this guy gets slaughtered

33:45.225 --> 33:49.296
by three sisters over his
lottery ticket.

33:49.329 --> 33:50.197
Yikes!

33:52.399 --> 33:53.267
Wanna see?

33:54.134 --> 33:54.802
- No.

33:54.836 --> 33:55.670
It's best I probably go.

33:56.671 --> 33:58.472
- One more drink?

33:58.506 --> 33:59.439
For scaring you?

34:01.576 --> 34:02.442
Please?

34:07.515 --> 34:08.650
- A quick one.

34:09.784 --> 34:10.818
- Only kind I like.

34:20.662 --> 34:22.462
These sisters are crazy.

34:56.698 --> 34:57.832
I'll take five bucks for it.

34:57.865 --> 34:58.700
- Oh, fuck!

34:58.733 --> 34:59.834
You scared me.

35:01.301 --> 35:02.503
- I need to stop doing
that.

35:05.907 --> 35:07.742
- I'll stick with the tea.

35:07.775 --> 35:09.209
- Hmm, more for me.

35:21.288 --> 35:22.456
- Uh, you want the chair?

35:22.489 --> 35:23.357
- Oh, no.

35:23.390 --> 35:25.225
I prefer this.

35:29.463 --> 35:31.766
- What's so hot about down
there?

35:31.799 --> 35:33.635
- It's more authentic.

35:33.668 --> 35:35.703
Makes me feel like I'm part of
the space.

35:38.305 --> 35:39.172
Join me.

35:40.508 --> 35:41.709
- On the floor?

35:42.944 --> 35:46.480
- Yeah, may sound hippydippy,
but connecting with the base

35:46.514 --> 35:48.683
of your home is a refreshing
perspective.

35:49.717 --> 35:51.385
When we became land animals,

35:51.418 --> 35:53.621
we used the ground for
everything we needed.

35:54.722 --> 35:57.525
We didn't start out on chairs
and beds.

35:58.660 --> 36:00.528
And then shoes were invented.

36:01.562 --> 36:04.364
I blame shoes for the
downfall of humanity.

36:05.533 --> 36:07.401
You know, if our feet can't
sense danger,

36:07.434 --> 36:09.369
how do we know when it's coming?

36:09.403 --> 36:10.772
- You lost me at hippydippy.

36:10.805 --> 36:13.641
- Oh, there's that New
York wit.

36:17.745 --> 36:20.480
- Lots of exciting things
coming off this floor.

36:20.515 --> 36:21.415
- I know.

36:24.819 --> 36:25.687
- Thoughts,

36:26.921 --> 36:28.355
vibrations,

36:29.957 --> 36:31.291
popcorn.

36:32.392 --> 36:33.528
Oh.

36:35.563 --> 36:39.534
So, I understood about

36:40.835 --> 36:42.369
none of what you just said.

36:43.437 --> 36:44.672
- It happens.

36:44.706 --> 36:46.874
- But the bare feet thing, I
get it.

36:47.775 --> 36:48.843
- Aaow!

36:50.912 --> 36:52.580
- When I was a kid, my
grandma had a birthday

36:52.613 --> 36:54.414
at a roller rink.

36:54.448 --> 36:55.817
We lived for an all-skate.

36:56.684 --> 36:58.452
- Your grandma skated with you?

36:58.485 --> 36:59.821
- Of course.

36:59.854 --> 37:01.923
She was legendary.

37:01.956 --> 37:04.659
Well, I was pretty good, too,
with the tricks and turns.

37:04.692 --> 37:06.293
I mean, we were at the rink all
the time.

37:06.326 --> 37:07.762
She taught me everything.

37:07.795 --> 37:10.263
But I wanted to do something
special:

37:10.297 --> 37:13.300
an original skate, just for her.

37:13.333 --> 37:13.968
- Aw.

37:15.302 --> 37:19.607
- But I didn't own any skates.

37:19.640 --> 37:22.810
I rented from the rink, so
the practice I had to do

37:22.844 --> 37:24.478
with them bare feet.

37:26.313 --> 37:29.050
This is where I support your
theory.

37:29.083 --> 37:31.786
- Am I ready for this?

37:38.659 --> 37:40.895
- This motion will work easy on
a wheel.

37:42.897 --> 37:46.601
Throw in some arms and a
shoulder.

37:51.371 --> 37:53.674
How about a sleeping prayer?

37:55.777 --> 37:57.545
I was looking tight.

37:58.780 --> 38:01.481
And when the party came, skates
went on.

38:02.349 --> 38:03.985
It looked more like this.

38:04.018 --> 38:06.419
Mm, ah, ah, huh.

38:06.453 --> 38:08.488
The skates fucked up my show!

38:08.523 --> 38:09.824
Grandma didn't care.

38:09.857 --> 38:12.492
She said it was the best
rolling she'd ever seen.

38:15.462 --> 38:16.463
I miss her.

38:16.496 --> 38:17.698
- Teach me the routine.

38:20.001 --> 38:23.436
- Do you have the strength to
fake-skate?

38:23.470 --> 38:24.906
- I do, I do.

38:24.939 --> 38:25.907
- How's your balance?

38:25.940 --> 38:27.642
- Oh, I can do tree pose.

38:27.675 --> 38:30.011
Sort of.

38:30.044 --> 38:31.879
- I'll only teach you the
chorus.

38:31.913 --> 38:33.681
The verses are too experimental.

38:34.715 --> 38:35.683
Ready?

38:35.716 --> 38:37.552
- Yes.

38:37.585 --> 38:40.320
- Ah, it was to Grandma's
favorite song, "It Had To Be
You."

40:17.852 --> 40:19.452
That wasn't tea.

41:19.046 --> 41:20.047
Stay calm.

41:21.048 --> 41:22.183
I'm not gonna hurt you.

41:24.685 --> 41:26.821
- What's happening?

41:26.854 --> 41:29.090
- I don't wanna say.

41:29.123 --> 41:30.558
- Help me.

41:30.591 --> 41:32.626
- This isn't your house!

41:32.660 --> 41:36.630
Who makes tea without asking?

41:36.664 --> 41:39.900
I knew when you said mint,
you used my Carolina jasmine,

41:39.934 --> 41:42.970
which is an herb, not
a tea, that causes...

41:43.004 --> 41:44.772
Well, you know, this!

41:44.805 --> 41:45.906
I can't let you go now.

41:47.608 --> 41:48.909
You're a liar.

41:48.943 --> 41:50.745
And a tattletale.

41:50.778 --> 41:52.980
People can't know about me.

41:53.014 --> 41:54.749
- I won't tell.

41:54.782 --> 41:56.650
- You ratted out the dorks who
pay you

41:56.684 --> 41:58.786
to treat them like dragon
slayers.

41:58.819 --> 42:00.955
You tell some John about me...

42:00.988 --> 42:03.024
Sorry, client, eh, eh, eh...

42:03.057 --> 42:05.860
Before you know it, I'm
all over social media.

42:05.893 --> 42:07.728
- Doesn't work like that.

42:07.762 --> 42:10.598
- Well, you'd know, you fucking
gossip!

42:15.169 --> 42:17.271
When you can move on
your own, he'll start.

42:20.808 --> 42:22.610
I won't let him hurt you like
this.

42:29.750 --> 42:32.053
I'm giving you to my dad.

43:25.973 --> 43:27.408
Let's use the tarps!

43:27.441 --> 43:29.276
That was a great idea.

43:38.018 --> 43:39.186
I get to help you now.

43:46.794 --> 43:48.129
I hate owing people.

43:48.162 --> 43:50.364
That's been my whole life.

45:03.037 --> 45:04.872
Take a little.

45:04.905 --> 45:05.940
For the nerves.

45:07.408 --> 45:08.275
Helps mine.

45:11.779 --> 45:12.413
Oh, oh.

45:13.314 --> 45:14.448
Waste not want not.

45:18.452 --> 45:20.888
For when you feel better.

45:42.376 --> 45:44.478
You were gonna drug me again.

45:52.152 --> 45:56.090
Saw where I kept my money and
rob me.

45:57.992 --> 46:00.227
After this great conversations?

46:00.261 --> 46:02.296
The things I shared with you?

46:04.431 --> 46:06.900
I have feelings, too, you know.

46:06.934 --> 46:08.135
- So do I.

46:08.168 --> 46:09.403
- We're not talking about you!

46:09.436 --> 46:11.171
We're talking about me!

46:12.940 --> 46:15.843
I paid you for a wish.

46:16.844 --> 46:18.445
You drug me.

46:18.479 --> 46:20.247
You choke me.

46:20.281 --> 46:21.315
You leave.

46:23.350 --> 46:25.286
The saffron was gonna
kill me.

46:26.887 --> 46:28.255
You don't stay.

46:28.289 --> 46:29.290
You leave.

46:30.891 --> 46:31.859
Why did you stay?

46:33.027 --> 46:33.994
- Sorry.

46:34.028 --> 46:35.829
- This is your fault!

46:37.498 --> 46:38.365
- Let me go.

46:40.034 --> 46:42.036
- I can't.

46:42.069 --> 46:44.506
Oh, I want to, but I can't.

46:44.539 --> 46:46.240
- Yes, you can.

46:46.273 --> 46:48.576
- It's him, Veronica.

46:48.610 --> 46:49.910
It isn't me.

46:59.019 --> 47:00.220
I don't want to tell her.

47:01.556 --> 47:03.123
I don't want her to know.

47:03.157 --> 47:05.426
Don't make me say it!

47:12.433 --> 47:13.967
I'm an abomination.

47:15.169 --> 47:18.238
My mother lived a long time ago.

47:21.442 --> 47:24.211
To the people in her
village, she was a mystic,

47:27.948 --> 47:28.583
a seer,

47:30.417 --> 47:31.485
a healer.

47:34.589 --> 47:36.190
She was so lonely.

47:37.991 --> 47:39.527
No man would have her.

47:42.564 --> 47:44.998
The kind of power she held,

47:47.134 --> 47:50.104
it welcomed darkness into her
life.

47:55.275 --> 47:57.645
What's more dangerous than
thinking you're a god?

48:00.180 --> 48:01.382
- Shoes.

48:01.415 --> 48:02.584
- Yes!

48:02.617 --> 48:04.118
Fuck shoes!

48:04.151 --> 48:05.687
Get right with the earth!

48:10.491 --> 48:12.627
I wish we met under
different circumstances.

48:12.660 --> 48:14.629
We could've been great friends.

48:15.963 --> 48:17.164
- We still can.

48:18.666 --> 48:20.100
- Are you even listening?

48:21.669 --> 48:25.005
Your lies don't work on me.

48:25.038 --> 48:28.142
When I tell you I have seen it
all,

48:28.175 --> 48:31.945
I have fucking seen it all.

48:39.186 --> 48:40.220
I can't die.

48:47.629 --> 48:49.564
May I continue, please?

48:50.665 --> 48:53.033
All my mother wanted was a
child.

48:54.168 --> 48:56.538
So she called him Madua
Muz, an evil water spirit.

49:00.040 --> 49:01.509
But tomato, tomatoe.

49:03.010 --> 49:04.612
Okay, okay!

49:04.646 --> 49:06.180
No more jokes!

49:07.582 --> 49:09.049
I'll finish the story.

49:11.686 --> 49:13.187
He gave my mother me.

49:16.089 --> 49:19.426
And, in exchange, she promised
to give him a sacrifice

49:19.460 --> 49:23.063
for every year he allowed me to
live.

49:27.134 --> 49:31.338
I was born from the water where
she led men to their deaths.

49:32.306 --> 49:37.110
My blood is their fury,
my bones their fear.

49:37.144 --> 49:39.279
I am their eternal damnation.

49:42.182 --> 49:44.686
But to Mom I was just a baby,

49:46.788 --> 49:47.655
her baby,

49:48.656 --> 49:51.458
to love

49:51.492 --> 49:52.560
forever.

49:55.730 --> 50:00.735
Saffron cleanses the soul from
impurities.

50:01.301 --> 50:06.173
All newborns were bathed
in it, like a christening.

50:08.643 --> 50:09.711
But not what I am.

50:12.412 --> 50:15.650
Saffron can't fix that.

50:16.751 --> 50:19.086
My skin turned yellow.

50:19.119 --> 50:20.354
My eyes bled.

50:21.255 --> 50:22.289
I was dying.

50:23.725 --> 50:27.094
Until Daddy appeared.

50:27.127 --> 50:29.531
He touched my face and
I came back to life.

50:32.466 --> 50:35.670
My existence was her weakness.

50:36.638 --> 50:38.673
No one could know about me.

50:40.207 --> 50:43.143
So she hid me away.

50:47.715 --> 50:49.049
I had nothing!

50:55.122 --> 50:55.823
No friends!

50:57.424 --> 50:58.593
No skills!

50:58.626 --> 51:01.261
No chance at a real life!

51:03.898 --> 51:08.836
I was her secret for 40
years, and I hated her for it.

51:14.274 --> 51:15.710
Daddy appeared to me again.

51:17.411 --> 51:18.813
He gave me a choice,

51:20.280 --> 51:22.584
the first choice of my life:

51:24.886 --> 51:28.388
kill myself and break Mom's
heart,

51:30.223 --> 51:31.693
or take her life

51:33.393 --> 51:34.762
and become immortal.

51:36.196 --> 51:37.732
I wanna go outside!

51:38.866 --> 51:41.368
I wanna feel the sun!

51:41.401 --> 51:42.336
I wanna live!

51:43.504 --> 51:44.872
So I killed her!

51:44.906 --> 51:48.141
I put my hands around her
throat and I choked her!

51:48.175 --> 51:48.810
I did it!

51:50.477 --> 51:51.345
- You're insane.

51:51.378 --> 51:53.380
- I'm not, he is!

51:54.515 --> 51:59.419
Every year, on my birthday,
he says he'll bring her back.

51:59.453 --> 52:01.522
Well, not her, like, a
reincarnated doesn't know

52:01.556 --> 52:05.560
she's my Mom version, her
soul in somebody else.

52:05.593 --> 52:09.129
If I find her, I get to do the
deal again.

52:10.297 --> 52:11.866
My life for hers.

52:13.433 --> 52:17.404
If I'm wrong, he gets
his yearly sacrifice.

52:19.272 --> 52:21.576
Mom should live, not me.

52:22.577 --> 52:24.612
I can't hurt anyone anymore.

52:25.980 --> 52:27.414
I thought you were her!

52:29.784 --> 52:30.652
- Why?

52:32.319 --> 52:33.286
- Your message.

52:34.354 --> 52:38.258
It said you make miracles
out of worthless men.

52:39.359 --> 52:42.664
That's the last thing she said
to me before I killed her.

52:46.668 --> 52:48.870
When we do this again, you run.

52:48.903 --> 52:50.538
The saffron will work.

52:50.571 --> 52:52.339
Let me die.

52:52.372 --> 52:54.776
You're her, I know it.

53:46.894 --> 53:47.895
- Shit.

53:56.604 --> 53:57.471
Help.

54:00.541 --> 54:03.443
- It's a lot to take in, I know.

54:36.010 --> 54:37.377
- Help.

54:37.410 --> 54:38.012
Help.
- Whoa!

54:38.045 --> 54:39.013
What's going on?

54:39.046 --> 54:40.615
- Get the fuck away from me!

54:41.682 --> 54:42.784
Where are my clothes?

54:42.817 --> 54:45.485
- In here, in the living room.

54:45.520 --> 54:46.654
Cover with this.

54:46.687 --> 54:47.922
- Stay back.

54:47.955 --> 54:49.090
- I don't know what you think
happened,

54:49.123 --> 54:50.091
but you tripped and hit your
head.

54:50.124 --> 54:51.692
Then I carried you in here.

54:51.726 --> 54:53.426
You've been out for a few hours.

54:54.361 --> 54:56.664
You'll sure get the money,
that's not a problem.

55:09.577 --> 55:11.746
You know what, take, take, take
a grand.

55:11.779 --> 55:15.382
I don't want you leaving here
thinking I'm some sick fuck.

55:15.415 --> 55:17.051
I was trying to help you.

55:17.084 --> 55:18.451
I'm sorry I scared you.

55:19.486 --> 55:20.453
- I fell?

55:20.487 --> 55:21.589
- Tripped.

55:21.622 --> 55:22.924
Over me.

55:22.957 --> 55:25.760
I didn't expect you to
shove me up the stairs,

55:25.793 --> 55:28.129
which was the type of abuse I
wanted,

55:28.162 --> 55:30.531
but my core is total shit
and I landed on my face.

55:30.565 --> 55:32.733
Then you landed on my
back and hit your head.

55:35.703 --> 55:38.639
I used to be into
ambulance chaser fantasies,

55:38.673 --> 55:41.709
you know, I'd hire a girl to
fake-choke,

55:41.742 --> 55:44.812
give her CPR, she'd reward me
with sex.

55:44.846 --> 55:47.849
So I thought maybe I
requested the wrong thing,

55:47.882 --> 55:50.383
but you wouldn't wake up.

55:51.853 --> 55:53.955
I didn't call 911
because I don't want them

55:53.988 --> 55:55.355
to know why you're here.

55:56.123 --> 55:57.592
I've never been arrested.

55:58.593 --> 56:00.695
I don't know your history with
the cops.

56:00.728 --> 56:02.697
I say no to jail time.

56:02.730 --> 56:03.931
- No!

56:24.852 --> 56:26.087
I can't take your money.

56:26.120 --> 56:27.755
- Oh, no, that's yours.

56:27.788 --> 56:28.656
You're taking it.

56:28.689 --> 56:29.624
- No.
- Yes.

56:29.657 --> 56:30.625
I insist.

56:32.994 --> 56:33.861
- All right then.

56:37.698 --> 56:39.634
- She's taking the money.

56:47.141 --> 56:48.475
- On one condition.

56:48.509 --> 56:49.810
- Whatever you want.

56:54.982 --> 56:55.983
- Give me a do-over.

56:57.885 --> 56:59.186
- A do-over?

56:59.220 --> 57:01.656
Like, sex for real?

57:03.124 --> 57:04.457
Or is this dry wit?

57:05.960 --> 57:06.827
- Yes,

57:07.962 --> 57:08.896
sex for real.

57:09.830 --> 57:10.731
- When?

57:11.966 --> 57:16.971
I'm out of town the rest of the
week, but maybe next Monday?

57:19.874 --> 57:21.542
- How about now?

57:21.575 --> 57:23.476
- Well, sure, but...

57:23.511 --> 57:26.180
Can we, like, start from the
beginning?

57:27.048 --> 57:29.617
You know, like, I'll meet
you at the restaurant,

57:30.885 --> 57:33.486
and I'm lost and stuff?

57:33.521 --> 57:34.155
- Sure.

57:42.029 --> 57:43.898
Meet you in 15 minutes.

57:43.931 --> 57:44.899
Okay?

57:48.202 --> 57:49.070
- Oh, wait.

57:53.741 --> 57:54.976
Your key.

58:53.267 --> 58:54.135
- A drink?

58:56.270 --> 58:57.772
What do you like?

58:57.805 --> 58:59.673
- Well, I'd take another latte.

58:59.707 --> 59:01.675
That really hit the spot.

59:01.709 --> 59:03.010
- I have alcohol.

59:03.044 --> 59:04.111
You want alcohol?

59:07.915 --> 59:09.250
- Oh, when in Rome.

59:45.186 --> 59:46.720
- Sit down.

59:46.754 --> 59:47.354
- Oh, yeah.

59:47.388 --> 59:48.255
Sure.

59:50.224 --> 59:51.826
- You like whiskey?

59:51.859 --> 59:55.162
- I like everything, except
liars and tattletales.

59:58.099 --> 1:00:00.835
Oh, but that's not what's
happening right now.

1:00:00.868 --> 1:00:03.270
What's happening right now is
whiskey.

1:00:03.304 --> 1:00:04.171
With you.

1:00:05.172 --> 1:00:06.040
Veronica.

1:00:10.811 --> 1:00:11.712
Cheers.

1:00:12.379 --> 1:00:13.247
- Cheers.

1:00:27.795 --> 1:00:28.662
Get up.

1:00:30.231 --> 1:00:32.099
- Getting my do-over.

1:00:33.968 --> 1:00:34.869
- Now.

1:00:37.705 --> 1:00:38.339
- I'm up.

1:00:42.743 --> 1:00:43.344
- Walk.

1:00:53.020 --> 1:00:53.888
Move!

1:01:00.027 --> 1:01:01.395
Get up, you pussy.

1:01:36.864 --> 1:01:39.066
What the fuck even is that?

1:01:39.099 --> 1:01:40.935
Are you even a man?

1:01:40.968 --> 1:01:41.835
- I am.

1:01:50.244 --> 1:01:51.946
The shirt stays on.

1:01:56.217 --> 1:01:57.952
- Get on the bed.

1:03:41.623 --> 1:03:42.557
- Good God.

1:03:43.558 --> 1:03:44.425
Wow.

1:03:46.026 --> 1:03:47.562
- Okay, I'll get
going.

1:03:47.595 --> 1:03:49.229
- Want another drink?

1:03:49.263 --> 1:03:51.533
- I have another
appointment in a few hours.

1:03:51.566 --> 1:03:52.600
- Sure, I understand.

1:03:55.969 --> 1:03:57.037
- Maybe a quick drink?

1:03:58.439 --> 1:03:59.907
- Only kind I like.

1:04:02.409 --> 1:04:03.344
- Allow me.

1:04:04.579 --> 1:04:06.413
- Moving in, I see.

1:04:06.447 --> 1:04:08.082
- What?

1:04:09.016 --> 1:04:10.951
- Acts like she owns me.

1:04:10.984 --> 1:04:12.152
Nice.

1:04:12.186 --> 1:04:13.420
- That's what you paid for.

1:04:29.136 --> 1:04:30.437
Should we cheers?

1:04:32.640 --> 1:04:34.576
- And disrespect the numerology
gods?

1:04:34.609 --> 1:04:36.611
Are you crazy?

1:04:36.644 --> 1:04:38.245
- What?

1:04:38.278 --> 1:04:39.146
- That

1:04:40.180 --> 1:04:41.583
shit you talked about earlier,

1:04:41.616 --> 1:04:46.621
something about you can't
cheers twice in one day

1:04:47.287 --> 1:04:51.125
'cause you'll look like an
asshole in front of the gods.

1:04:51.158 --> 1:04:53.260
- I thought I dreamed that.

1:04:54.529 --> 1:04:56.564
- Well, you did, you told me
about it,

1:04:56.598 --> 1:05:00.267
the dream that you had when you
fell.

1:05:00.300 --> 1:05:01.603
- No.

1:05:03.470 --> 1:05:05.406
- You remember where I
keep the good whiskey

1:05:05.439 --> 1:05:09.276
but you can't remember
your dream?

1:05:09.309 --> 1:05:10.512
- I remember my dream.

1:05:10.545 --> 1:05:12.514
I don't remember telling you
about it.

1:05:12.547 --> 1:05:13.981
- Well, you did.

1:05:16.684 --> 1:05:19.554
So, should we cheer?

1:05:21.355 --> 1:05:23.290
Or give the gods their respect?

1:05:29.229 --> 1:05:30.164
- Cheers.

1:05:39.039 --> 1:05:39.674
Thanks.

1:05:41.074 --> 1:05:42.109
- Hold on, Veronica.

1:05:43.545 --> 1:05:46.246
I mean, you don't have to tell
me.

1:05:48.148 --> 1:05:52.986
I, I, I, I respect your privacy,
and everything about you,

1:05:53.020 --> 1:05:57.024
really, but is Veronica your
real name?

1:05:59.159 --> 1:06:00.360
- No.

1:06:01.563 --> 1:06:03.363
- Well, can you tell me what it
is?

1:06:04.799 --> 1:06:08.402
You know, for my
memory bank.

1:06:15.075 --> 1:06:15.710
- Genevieve.

1:06:17.344 --> 1:06:18.212
- Wow!

1:06:20.682 --> 1:06:23.417
That is way better than
Veronica.

1:06:23.450 --> 1:06:26.654
- Not when everybody
calls you Jenny or Gene.

1:06:26.688 --> 1:06:28.288
- I'd never do that.

1:06:29.256 --> 1:06:30.190
- You okay?

1:06:32.694 --> 1:06:33.695
- Genevieve.

1:06:36.230 --> 1:06:37.197
Run!

1:06:46.273 --> 1:06:49.109
- Grab, grab on me.

1:06:50.678 --> 1:06:52.814
- You should've believed me.

1:08:17.497 --> 1:08:18.533
A little bit longer?

1:08:20.768 --> 1:08:22.570
This one was different.

1:10:02.670 --> 1:10:03.571
Mummy.
