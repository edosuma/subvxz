04:07.440 --> 04:09.761
His name was Jeremiah Johnson.

04:09.920 --> 04:12.924
They say he wanted
to be a mountain man.

04:14.560 --> 04:18.644
The story goes that he was a man
of proper wit and adventurous spirit...

04:18.920 --> 04:20.649
suited to the mountains.

04:23.400 --> 04:27.485
Nobody knows where he came from,
and it don't seem to matter much.

04:27.720 --> 04:28.767
He was a young man...

04:28.960 --> 04:33.249
and ghosty stories about
the tall hills didn't scare him none.

04:35.680 --> 04:39.162
He was looking for e Hewkin gun,
50 caliber or better.

04:39.440 --> 04:43.240
He settled for e 30, but damn,
it was e genuine Hewkin.

04:44.160 --> 04:45.924
You couldn't do no better.

04:47.240 --> 04:50.722
Bought a horse, traps and other truck
that went with being a mountain man.

04:52.080 --> 04:54.321
And said goodbye
to whatever life was down below.

04:55.160 --> 04:59.802
Where is it I could find bear, beaver,
other critters worth cash skinned?

05:00.080 --> 05:04.642
Ride due west as the sun sets.
Turn left at the Rocky Mountains.

05:06.600 --> 05:08.364
This here 's his story.

11:27.920 --> 11:30.400
"I, Hatchet Jack..."

11:31.160 --> 11:34.243
being of sound mind
and broken legs...

11:34.520 --> 11:38.047
do hereby leaveth my bear rifle...

11:38.320 --> 11:40.084
to whatever finds it.

11:40.720 --> 11:44.930
Lord hope it be a white man.

11:45.400 --> 11:47.607
It is a good rifle...

11:47.880 --> 11:51.009
and killed the bear that killed me.

11:51.920 --> 11:54.890
Anyway, I am dead.

11:55.160 --> 11:58.164
"Yours truly, Hatchet Jack."

12:12.160 --> 12:13.571
Ha, ha!

12:14.600 --> 12:16.523
A 50 caliber Hawkin!

13:39.440 --> 13:40.487
Come on, you.

13:42.720 --> 13:45.610
That'll be far enough, pilgrim!

13:49.440 --> 13:50.680
Where are you?

13:50.960 --> 13:53.042
You're a fine target, pilgrim!

13:53.640 --> 13:55.608
Empty your hand.

14:09.680 --> 14:12.729
I ain't seen no live man in 2 months.

14:13.320 --> 14:15.482
I am Bear Claw Chris Lapp.

14:15.760 --> 14:19.401
Blood kin to the grizzly
that bit Jim Bridger's ass!

14:19.680 --> 14:21.887
You are molesting my hunt!

14:23.040 --> 14:24.690
- I am...
- I know who you are!

14:25.000 --> 14:28.288
You're the same dumb pilgrim
I've been hearing for 20 days...

14:28.560 --> 14:30.801
and smelling for 3!

14:39.240 --> 14:41.846
How come you ain't been scalped?

14:44.360 --> 14:46.124
Ain't been too lucky?

14:47.720 --> 14:52.044
- No.
- This place has been trapped out since '25.

14:53.320 --> 14:54.367
Why are you here?

14:54.880 --> 14:56.370
I hunt griz.

14:57.040 --> 15:00.965
- Griz?
- Grizzly bears, pilgrim. I collect the claws.

15:02.960 --> 15:04.530
I had one in that thicket.

15:04.840 --> 15:07.161
Ready to shake hands,
until you came!

15:08.520 --> 15:09.567
I'm sorry, then.

15:09.880 --> 15:11.450
You look it!

15:12.200 --> 15:14.009
Hungry too?

15:14.280 --> 15:15.691
Come on.

15:19.320 --> 15:22.005
You know how to skin griz?

15:22.280 --> 15:24.408
I can skin most anything.

15:25.560 --> 15:28.928
You sure are cocky
for a starving pilgrim.

15:33.600 --> 15:37.127
There she be. Go in, get warm,
eat something.

15:37.400 --> 15:39.880
I've got a chore to finish.

15:40.200 --> 15:41.440
My boy!

15:41.600 --> 15:44.444
Are you sure
that you can skin griz?

15:44.720 --> 15:47.007
Just as fast as you can find them.

16:36.960 --> 16:38.246
Jesus!

16:43.280 --> 16:46.887
Skin that one, pilgrim,
and I'll get you another!

17:13.240 --> 17:15.242
Must have missed
another war down there.

17:17.880 --> 17:18.961
Didn't miss nothing.

17:22.960 --> 17:26.601
If I head due west tomorrow,
will I find places to trap?

17:26.880 --> 17:31.329
If you head due west or any place
tomorrow, you'll be starving in a week.

17:31.600 --> 17:34.331
You ain't likely to meet
someone like me.

17:37.000 --> 17:38.729
Mountain's got its own ways.

17:39.640 --> 17:40.721
What?

17:41.080 --> 17:44.641
Use that skin pad, pilgrim,
before you lose all your fingers.

17:48.120 --> 17:51.727
What you learned down in the flat
will serve you no good up here.

17:52.040 --> 17:53.929
You got some work to do.

18:23.760 --> 18:25.046
Utes and Flatheads...

18:25.320 --> 18:28.085
are generally peaceful critters.

18:28.600 --> 18:31.001
Crows, they are fearful.

18:31.400 --> 18:32.686
Mighty warriors too.

18:33.480 --> 18:36.563
In my opinion, the Crows
are the handsomest Indians there is.

18:36.880 --> 18:38.166
And proud too.

18:39.200 --> 18:41.726
There ain't a man alive
can match them on a horse.

18:42.280 --> 18:45.124
I've seen them ride
with one foot on the horse's rump...

18:45.400 --> 18:47.687
one wrist through a loop
in the mane...

18:47.960 --> 18:50.611
shooting arrows and guns
under the horse's neck!

18:52.320 --> 18:54.402
But they are an adulterous people.

18:54.680 --> 18:56.728
Adulterous.

18:57.120 --> 19:00.090
Here you are, pilgrim.
Sharp enough to scale a fish with.

19:21.480 --> 19:22.766
Ever get lonesome?

19:23.320 --> 19:24.367
For what?

19:26.640 --> 19:27.687
Woman?

19:30.400 --> 19:31.845
Full-time night woman?

19:35.280 --> 19:37.681
I never could find no tracks
in a woman's heart.

19:38.480 --> 19:41.006
I packed a Squaw
for 10 years, pilgrim.

19:41.960 --> 19:43.928
Cheyenne, she was.

19:44.240 --> 19:46.766
And the meanest bitch
that ever balled for beads!

19:47.080 --> 19:51.642
I lodgepoled her at Dead Wolf Creek
and traded her for a Hawkin gun!

19:51.960 --> 19:54.770
Don't get me wrong,
I love the women, I surely do!

19:55.680 --> 19:57.125
But I swear...

19:57.440 --> 19:59.886
a woman's breast
is the hardest rock...

20:00.160 --> 20:02.367
the Almighty ever made on Earth...

20:02.640 --> 20:05.211
and I can find no sign on it.

20:08.840 --> 20:12.208
Now these coals here
will simmer until sunrise.

20:12.720 --> 20:14.722
You better go do likewise.

20:39.200 --> 20:41.407
Didn't put enough dirt down.

20:42.040 --> 20:44.168
Saw it right off.

20:56.720 --> 20:58.449
You track well, pilgrim.

20:59.400 --> 21:02.802
- Kind of like it, don't you?
- Maybe.

21:02.960 --> 21:04.610
Figures. A human man...

21:04.880 --> 21:06.962
likes tracking and killing.

21:07.280 --> 21:09.567
An Injun, he figures it's natural.

21:13.280 --> 21:14.486
Wind's right.

21:14.760 --> 21:17.570
But he'll just run, soon as
we step out of these trees.

21:17.840 --> 21:22.050
Trick to it.
Walk out on this side of your horse.

21:23.960 --> 21:25.405
What if he sees our feet?

21:25.560 --> 21:28.962
Elk don't know
how many feet a horse has.

21:32.720 --> 21:35.087
No, you damn fool!
Slide it up over the saddle!

21:51.320 --> 21:54.722
You got him, pilgrim!
You nailed him clean.

21:55.880 --> 21:57.962
We got us an elk to skin!

22:02.120 --> 22:07.524
Can't figure people there
eating hog when they could feed on elk.

22:13.800 --> 22:15.245
Didn't like it down there?

22:17.800 --> 22:19.928
- Ought to have been different.
- Is that so?

22:21.160 --> 22:24.004
Many a child journeys
this high to be different.

22:24.320 --> 22:27.608
To get from here what their natures
couldn't get them below.

22:28.600 --> 22:29.806
It comes to nothing.

22:31.160 --> 22:34.448
Can't cheat the mountain, pilgrim.
Mountain got it...

22:57.520 --> 23:01.969
Probably Crow. They'll steal
our horses unless we bribe them.

23:02.120 --> 23:03.167
Why?

23:03.360 --> 23:05.567
It's their territory.
They figure we're trespassing.

23:07.440 --> 23:08.930
Yep, Crow.

23:09.400 --> 23:14.167
Paints-His-Shirt-Red.
That's his sign. Just stand still.

23:36.840 --> 23:38.126
You two know each other?

23:38.400 --> 23:39.686
I saw him once.

23:41.960 --> 23:43.883
He says you fish poorly.

23:45.120 --> 23:46.531
You understand their language?

23:46.840 --> 23:50.367
Paints-His-Shirt speaks English,
he just does this to aggravate me.

24:03.280 --> 24:05.123
Says he's got enough bear claws.

24:07.160 --> 24:09.288
Hold that.

24:40.960 --> 24:42.530
What's your name?

24:43.880 --> 24:45.405
Johnson.

24:47.920 --> 24:49.570
Your Christian name?

24:50.960 --> 24:52.121
Jeremiah.

25:10.520 --> 25:13.171
You've learned well, pilgrim.
You'll go far.

25:13.760 --> 25:16.286
Providing you ain't burnt alive
or scalped.

25:16.560 --> 25:17.766
I will do my best.

25:19.520 --> 25:22.808
You can out wood
and leave it up on the Judith.

25:23.680 --> 25:27.127
Riverboat captains will leave you gold
if you put out a pouch.

25:27.520 --> 25:29.284
Good thing to know...

25:29.600 --> 25:31.284
if times get hard.

25:37.960 --> 25:39.291
Watch your topknot.

25:40.400 --> 25:42.801
Yes. Watch yours.

28:22.800 --> 28:26.486
I told you not to go play outside.
You got yourself all dirty...

28:26.800 --> 28:29.644
and also, young lady...

28:29.880 --> 28:32.406
without your shoes.

28:33.360 --> 28:34.964
And you, Josh...

28:35.920 --> 28:37.206
dirty!

28:38.120 --> 28:40.122
Look at you! There, now!

28:42.320 --> 28:45.164
Mary Lou, you knew better
than to go out in the sun...

28:50.200 --> 28:52.931
Have I told you not to go out...

28:53.240 --> 28:56.289
without a bonnet on your head?

29:05.720 --> 29:07.563
You better stop there.

29:19.080 --> 29:20.969
Woman, I am your friend.

29:25.440 --> 29:27.442
We have graves to dig.

29:33.520 --> 29:35.727
You were borne on the wind today.

29:37.320 --> 29:41.530
Josh was being a bad boy.
I must tell your father.

29:43.760 --> 29:46.047
Time to start the garden.

29:47.760 --> 29:49.330
If the wind would stop.

30:01.440 --> 30:02.726
We will now sing.

30:04.480 --> 30:09.168
Shall we gather at the river

30:09.720 --> 30:14.044
Where bright angel feet have trod

30:14.360 --> 30:18.251
With its crystal tide forever

30:18.720 --> 30:22.884
Flowing by the throne of God

30:23.240 --> 30:27.643
Yes, we'll gather at the river

30:27.960 --> 30:32.648
The beautiful, the beautiful river

30:32.920 --> 30:37.687
Gather with the saints at the river

30:37.960 --> 30:41.931
That flows by the throne of God

31:14.320 --> 31:16.607
Boy, did you see all this?

31:22.640 --> 31:24.802
Better get one of these biscuits, boy.

31:27.600 --> 31:29.329
I make damn good biscuits.

32:12.200 --> 32:13.690
Here's food.

32:38.520 --> 32:41.364
I could not find your husband
anywhere, ma'am.

32:42.040 --> 32:44.361
So, maybe he will come back here.

32:50.720 --> 32:54.088
The Indians will not bother you now,
on account of...

32:54.400 --> 32:55.970
you are touched.

32:57.320 --> 32:59.004
They will be afraid.

33:07.960 --> 33:09.644
What about the boy?

34:30.520 --> 34:34.002
Maybe you and the boy
best come with me now.

34:36.840 --> 34:40.003
I will take you down to the Judith.
Put you on a ferry.

35:04.640 --> 35:05.721
Take him.

35:06.040 --> 35:07.644
- What?
- Take him!

35:09.760 --> 35:12.206
Ma'am, I wouldn't know how
to tend after...

35:36.120 --> 35:38.122
You got a name, boy?

35:39.160 --> 35:40.571
Huh?

35:44.440 --> 35:46.329
I will call you Caleb.

35:46.600 --> 35:49.001
It is a name
I have always admired.

35:49.280 --> 35:51.248
You like that? Caleb?

35:55.080 --> 35:57.845
Do what you like.
I was much the same myself.

36:19.720 --> 36:21.006
Damn!

36:41.040 --> 36:42.121
Are you all right?

36:42.280 --> 36:45.762
Sure, I got a fine horse under me!

36:48.000 --> 36:51.288
Got one of them feathers
in my nose.

36:53.920 --> 36:55.490
Keep sneezing,
it'll come out all right.

36:59.440 --> 37:01.886
Haven't seen anyone pass by recently,
have you?

37:02.160 --> 37:05.130
Nobody's gone in front of me.

37:05.400 --> 37:07.323
Can't say what's happened
behind me though.

37:13.160 --> 37:14.810
The Injuns put you here?

37:15.160 --> 37:17.208
It weren't Mormons.

37:17.520 --> 37:21.844
A chief, name of Mad Wolf.
Nice fellow, don't talk a hell of a lot.

37:22.280 --> 37:25.090
You wouldn't have
an extra hat on you, would you?

37:25.360 --> 37:27.488
Shade's getting scarce in these parts.

37:27.800 --> 37:29.290
Why did you shave your head?

37:30.160 --> 37:33.369
Mad Wolf figures like
every other Injun I know.

37:33.680 --> 37:38.481
Says this scalp ain't fit
for no decent man's lodgepole.

37:38.760 --> 37:42.970
Ain't the first time I protected
my head in such a way.

37:43.480 --> 37:45.528
Name's Del Gue.

37:45.800 --> 37:47.211
With an "E."

37:48.680 --> 37:51.889
- When did they come through?
- A few hours ago.

37:52.240 --> 37:54.811
I will be happy to see my horse.
I hate walking.

37:56.280 --> 37:58.965
I knew you would help me
get my pelts back.

37:59.360 --> 38:02.364
I wouldn't leave a man
without a horse or gun.

38:05.920 --> 38:08.207
Ain't that Hatchet Jack's rifle?

38:08.360 --> 38:09.521
Yeah.

38:09.720 --> 38:10.721
How did you get it?

38:11.000 --> 38:13.128
I found him, froze to a tree.

38:13.600 --> 38:14.840
Damn!

38:15.600 --> 38:17.728
That Hatchet Jack was a wild one.

38:17.960 --> 38:19.962
He was living with a female panther.

38:20.240 --> 38:22.971
Two years in a cave
up in the Musselshell.

38:23.240 --> 38:25.129
She never did get used to him.

38:32.240 --> 38:33.730
That be them.

38:34.720 --> 38:36.529
- How many you figure?
- Three.

38:37.080 --> 38:39.003
Just like before.

38:41.800 --> 38:43.848
Are you smelling them Blackfeet?

38:44.120 --> 38:48.569
No, I'm locating my horse.
Dirtiest animal this side of hell.

38:49.160 --> 38:53.609
Come dark, you give me your pistol.
Load that bear rifle full of nails.

38:54.040 --> 38:57.487
No. I got no truck with them Blackfeet.

38:57.760 --> 39:01.128
I plan to be here a long time.
I do not want them down on me.

39:01.440 --> 39:05.411
Them critters hammered me
into the ground. Took my rifle, horse.

39:05.680 --> 39:09.480
Stole my pelts. Not to mention
what they done to that boy's folks!

39:09.640 --> 39:10.766
Then let it pass?

39:11.000 --> 39:12.286
Nope.

39:12.800 --> 39:14.086
But they'll be asleep soon.

39:14.360 --> 39:17.842
Should be no trouble to slip in there
and then get your possibles.

39:26.920 --> 39:28.684
Use this blanket, boy.

39:29.120 --> 39:30.610
To keep you warm.

39:33.440 --> 39:35.044
He don't say a lot, does he?

39:35.280 --> 39:36.327
No.

39:42.240 --> 39:43.571
Hey.

39:45.280 --> 39:46.441
No.

39:47.400 --> 39:48.811
No.

39:49.480 --> 39:51.562
Stay here with the animals.

40:31.840 --> 40:33.330
No!

40:34.760 --> 40:36.728
I am Del Gue!

40:37.000 --> 40:39.526
I can whip my weight in Wolverines...

40:41.000 --> 40:45.005
straight through a crab apple orchard
on a flash of lightning!

40:45.880 --> 40:47.211
You've stolen my pelts!

40:47.480 --> 40:49.403
And die, you must!

40:57.640 --> 41:00.644
You skinheaded son of a bitch,
you almost got me killed!

41:16.720 --> 41:17.846
Where are you going?

41:19.720 --> 41:21.131
Don't you want any of these?

41:23.400 --> 41:24.401
What?

41:24.880 --> 41:25.927
Scalps!

41:29.280 --> 41:30.520
No.

41:33.840 --> 41:37.731
Mother Gue never raised
such a foolish child.

41:49.000 --> 41:50.604
Stop that, boy.

41:57.280 --> 42:00.250
- What do you do with the scalps?
- Sell them to the English.

42:00.720 --> 42:01.926
English?

42:02.440 --> 42:05.250
London is wallpapered
with Injun scalps.

42:43.360 --> 42:46.489
- Let's pull into those trees.
- Don't go getting hasty.

42:47.800 --> 42:50.929
Them is Flatheads, and they've hurt
nobody that I know.

42:51.360 --> 42:53.203
Just hold back.

43:09.920 --> 43:12.924
- What's he saying?
- Says they're Blackfeet ponies.

43:22.320 --> 43:24.288
He asks if you are the great warrior...

43:24.560 --> 43:27.882
who avenges the Crazy Woman
in the Wolf Tail Valley.

43:28.200 --> 43:29.531
She's big medicine.

43:29.760 --> 43:31.842
And so are you,
if you are that man.

43:36.040 --> 43:38.771
- So what's he shouting for?
- Scared of you.

43:46.560 --> 43:49.245
- But how did you...?
- I didn't know they'd be Flatheads.

44:16.080 --> 44:17.241
It's all right, boy.

44:17.560 --> 44:20.564
Chief here is named
Two-Tongues Lebeaux.

44:20.840 --> 44:22.922
Mighty educated too.

44:23.080 --> 44:25.731
French missionaries
taught him their language.

44:26.000 --> 44:29.049
- Christian Indians?
- Lots of them.

45:22.880 --> 45:27.522
He says the scalps are fierce
and the horses are fleet.

45:29.160 --> 45:30.810
Take them.

45:32.640 --> 45:35.644
Take them. And the ponies.
I have no further use for them.

45:35.960 --> 45:37.803
Damn fool,
you may have cooked our brains!

45:38.000 --> 45:39.001
Why?

45:39.160 --> 45:41.686
He brought us here to honor you
and you want to give him a gift.

45:41.880 --> 45:44.167
If he cannot give you a better one,
it'll be an insult.

46:28.720 --> 46:29.801
What's so funny?

46:31.520 --> 46:32.885
The danger is over.

46:33.840 --> 46:35.330
He has thought of a better gift.

46:36.080 --> 46:37.730
- His daughter.
- Huh?

46:37.920 --> 46:40.400
Now you have a son,
you need a wife.

46:40.720 --> 46:43.963
- I don't want no wife...
- He says he'll be very happy.

46:49.720 --> 46:52.451
What is that word? Oh, yes!

46:57.720 --> 47:00.166
He may read the Bible,
but he's still an Injun.

47:00.440 --> 47:02.090
And his rules is his rules.

47:02.400 --> 47:05.449
If you value your hair,
you will get married!

47:09.240 --> 47:12.403
Del Gue,
I do not think this is funny.

47:12.760 --> 47:13.761
It ain't.

47:14.080 --> 47:17.448
When you leave, you can
take her to Fort Hawley and sell her.

47:18.120 --> 47:20.487
But you best take her, friend.

47:20.920 --> 47:22.888
Besides, maybe she ain't near bad.

47:45.760 --> 47:50.004
He says she's called The Swan,
but she'll answer to anything you want.

47:54.280 --> 47:55.725
But maybe you need her.

47:57.360 --> 48:00.682
You turn down this gift, they'll slit
you, me, Caleb and the horses...

48:00.960 --> 48:04.646
from crotch to eyeball
with a dull deer antler!

49:06.040 --> 49:08.611
Pleased to make your acquaintance,
Mrs. Johnson.

49:08.760 --> 49:11.491
Your husband has told me
so much about you.

49:11.880 --> 49:15.282
Congratulations, Two-Tongues.
Wonderful wedding.

49:16.120 --> 49:18.771
- Bye, Jeremiah Johnson!
- Where are you going?

49:19.040 --> 49:22.010
I wouldn't want to disturb
your wedding night.

49:23.080 --> 49:25.003
I'll see you in the fall.

49:26.040 --> 49:28.441
Have a nice honeymoon,
Mrs. Johnson.

49:54.080 --> 49:55.570
Do you speak any English?

50:04.040 --> 50:05.849
I don't speak any Flathead.

50:13.920 --> 50:15.684
So don't bother me, neither of you!

50:55.840 --> 50:57.330
Wondering about something?

51:02.120 --> 51:03.485
Go ahead, ask.

51:14.040 --> 51:17.044
Leave it be.

51:18.160 --> 51:20.003
Nothing wrong with quiet.

51:24.680 --> 51:27.251
Cooking sure
don't smell like Bear Claw's.

51:31.160 --> 51:33.003
Tie him off, boy.

52:04.160 --> 52:05.525
Suppertime!

52:13.440 --> 52:16.410
Go on, boy, and eat.
It's good for you.

52:38.640 --> 52:40.244
No.

52:41.560 --> 52:42.846
I'm full.

52:52.080 --> 52:53.320
You religious too?

52:54.760 --> 52:56.205
Religious.

53:06.080 --> 53:07.764
I'm not going to harm you.

53:11.720 --> 53:13.290
Religious.

53:14.760 --> 53:16.125
Yes.

53:17.600 --> 53:18.965
Yes.

53:21.440 --> 53:22.965
I'm not going to harm you.

53:26.800 --> 53:28.450
Yes.

53:29.000 --> 53:30.490
Yes.

53:34.320 --> 53:36.049
Yes!

53:38.840 --> 53:40.365
Yes.

53:40.880 --> 53:43.770
Ain't that a lot easier
than saying all that gibberish?

53:45.880 --> 53:47.644
Yes!

53:53.160 --> 53:54.491
Great hunter.

53:56.280 --> 53:57.486
Yes.

53:58.520 --> 54:00.170
- Yes.
- Yeah.

54:01.160 --> 54:03.049
Fine figure of a man, yes?

54:06.200 --> 54:07.361
Yes?

54:07.880 --> 54:11.726
- Yes.
- That is all you need to know. For now.

54:15.520 --> 54:17.090
You getting enough, boy?

54:20.600 --> 54:21.840
Yes.

55:26.920 --> 55:29.082
This wasn't my idea, you know?

56:47.640 --> 56:48.721
Lord!

59:21.160 --> 59:22.764
ThiS'll do.

59:25.440 --> 59:27.408
River in front, cliffs behind.

59:28.440 --> 59:31.046
Good water. Not much wind.

59:34.400 --> 59:36.209
This will be a good place to live.

01:01:14.840 --> 01:01:16.080
Hawk.

01:01:16.440 --> 01:01:19.762
Yeah. Going for the Musselshell.

01:01:21.440 --> 01:01:24.922
It'd take me a week's riding.
And he'll be there in...

01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:27.764
Hell, he's there already.

01:01:39.360 --> 01:01:44.844
I wish you would see fit to stop
the practicing of these ceremonies.

01:01:52.800 --> 01:01:53.847
NO!

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:57.402
Caleb, take notice of the traps
and go fetch some proper food.

01:02:00.080 --> 01:02:02.890
And keep your nose open,
there may be Indians about.

01:02:32.800 --> 01:02:34.564
Be going for buffalo soon.

01:02:43.400 --> 01:02:44.526
No, you'll stay here.

01:02:47.920 --> 01:02:50.924
Here. Go on,
fetch the rest of that wood.

01:02:57.640 --> 01:02:58.926
Ch.

01:03:08.400 --> 01:03:10.528
Swan, I cannot stand this weight.

01:03:35.920 --> 01:03:37.410
Well...

01:03:38.240 --> 01:03:39.730
It will have to do.

01:04:16.720 --> 01:04:18.210
Johnson.

01:04:36.800 --> 01:04:39.041
It will keep me warm
in the strong wind.

01:04:39.960 --> 01:04:42.042
And the rain
will not pass through neither.

01:04:45.160 --> 01:04:46.241
Thank you.

01:09:01.920 --> 01:09:03.729
You have beaver scent?

01:09:11.720 --> 01:09:13.245
What happened to your face?

01:09:20.640 --> 01:09:22.529
Huh? My beard?

01:09:31.680 --> 01:09:33.170
Watch this.

01:09:35.760 --> 01:09:36.807
Spring.

01:09:38.840 --> 01:09:39.886
There.

01:09:41.560 --> 01:09:43.688
Careful, that'll take your hand off.

01:09:59.760 --> 01:10:01.444
Put that smell down.

01:10:02.800 --> 01:10:04.404
Won't come around
without the smell.

01:10:49.480 --> 01:10:51.881
Hell, don't run off. It's me.

01:10:57.960 --> 01:10:59.007
What?

01:10:59.160 --> 01:11:00.764
Skin this.

01:12:12.400 --> 01:12:13.765
Troop, halt!

01:12:16.320 --> 01:12:17.924
Johnson?

01:12:22.760 --> 01:12:25.730
I'm Lieutenant Mulvey,
Third Cavalry.

01:12:27.640 --> 01:12:29.404
That's Reverend Lindquist.

01:12:31.440 --> 01:12:34.489
We've been watched since
we started to climb up from the Gila.

01:12:39.280 --> 01:12:40.361
Who are they, Flathead?

01:12:45.760 --> 01:12:47.000
I said, are they Flathead?

01:12:52.920 --> 01:12:55.161
- Did I say something?
- No.

01:12:55.440 --> 01:12:57.124
It's been a long time...

01:12:58.120 --> 01:12:59.770
since I had...

01:13:00.080 --> 01:13:02.367
so much of the English language
spoke at me.

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:04.525
I ain't used to it.

01:13:05.800 --> 01:13:07.086
Crow.

01:13:07.920 --> 01:13:09.160
This is Crow land.

01:13:09.480 --> 01:13:11.960
This is the Department of Colorado.

01:13:13.400 --> 01:13:16.529
- Yeah.
- You're on good terms with them.

01:13:16.800 --> 01:13:17.881
Crow?

01:13:18.160 --> 01:13:19.286
Who gave you that idea?

01:13:19.520 --> 01:13:21.329
People talk about it down below.

01:13:21.640 --> 01:13:22.801
You live up here.

01:13:24.800 --> 01:13:25.961
I do that.

01:13:26.200 --> 01:13:28.282
And you know the high country.

01:13:28.520 --> 01:13:30.841
Do you know Feather Mesa?

01:13:32.640 --> 01:13:33.846
I do. So?

01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:35.490
We have wagons there. Three of them.

01:13:36.160 --> 01:13:37.810
Broke down in the snow and ice.

01:13:38.040 --> 01:13:40.805
We got to get them
out of there before they freeze.

01:13:41.040 --> 01:13:42.280
Gr the Indians get them.

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:45.047
Would be wise.

01:13:48.160 --> 01:13:50.970
We were told that
you would know how to get there.

01:13:53.520 --> 01:13:55.443
Through those passes.

01:13:59.800 --> 01:14:01.928
We were hoping that maybe...

01:14:06.360 --> 01:14:08.647
These are Christian families.

01:14:08.960 --> 01:14:12.043
Christian women
and children, starving.

01:14:22.440 --> 01:14:25.683
Do you mean that you intend
to let those people die?

01:14:39.400 --> 01:14:41.209
How's the war going?

01:14:41.560 --> 01:14:42.891
Which war?

01:14:43.960 --> 01:14:46.406
One against the President of Mexico.

01:14:47.400 --> 01:14:49.209
It's over.

01:14:52.920 --> 01:14:54.081
Who won?

01:15:41.400 --> 01:15:44.643
Did you hear something?

01:15:50.440 --> 01:15:51.851
Can't go through here.

01:15:52.040 --> 01:15:53.087
Why not?

01:15:53.440 --> 01:15:56.205
Crow burial ground. Sacred.

01:15:57.640 --> 01:16:00.962
- We'll have to turn around and head east.
- How far east?

01:16:01.480 --> 01:16:02.970
Next pass.

01:16:03.640 --> 01:16:06.120
Twenty... 20 miles or so.

01:16:06.360 --> 01:16:11.002
Those people are waiting for us!
They're freezing, hungry and scared.

01:16:11.280 --> 01:16:14.090
Crow only come with medicine men
and burying parties!

01:16:14.320 --> 01:16:16.971
- We are not Crows!
- What would happen?

01:16:18.160 --> 01:16:19.650
I don't know.

01:16:22.280 --> 01:16:23.327
I don't know.

01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:28.731
This is big medicine.
They guard it with spirits.

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:30.206
You don't believe that.

01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:32.365
It doesn't matter. They do.

01:16:32.680 --> 01:16:35.081
You've been up here too long,
believing in this!

01:16:35.360 --> 01:16:40.366
What chance would I have finding
a way through, just by riding west?

01:16:40.640 --> 01:16:42.881
Poor chance. Or none.

01:16:50.800 --> 01:16:53.690
Thanks all the same, Johnson,
but we're riding through.

01:16:54.040 --> 01:16:56.771
Sergeant! Prepare to move!

01:16:57.680 --> 01:16:58.841
You won't make it.

01:17:03.600 --> 01:17:05.409
You have to hunt, you said.

01:17:07.520 --> 01:17:08.931
I have to try.

01:17:18.400 --> 01:17:21.006
Tell your men to keep
behind me in single file.

01:17:22.880 --> 01:17:25.167
Tell them to go slow
and stay quiet.

01:17:25.560 --> 01:17:27.050
- Sergeant!
- Sir.

01:17:27.240 --> 01:17:28.526
Single file, slowly.

01:17:28.760 --> 01:17:30.091
Yes, sir.

01:17:30.400 --> 01:17:31.845
Keep them quiet.

01:20:40.480 --> 01:20:42.926
Well, we seem to have escaped.

01:20:47.080 --> 01:20:49.924
How long have you
been carrying your Squaw?

01:21:24.720 --> 01:21:26.404
- Thank you...
- Move them fast.

01:21:26.560 --> 01:21:28.324
Crow don't take kindly to trespassing.

01:37:39.880 --> 01:37:44.602
Where's your mule that kicks holes
in the sky and shakes off its saddle?

01:37:44.960 --> 01:37:47.930
Where's your slavering wolf
of the rolling prairie?

01:37:48.360 --> 01:37:52.524
Here's your old grizzer brown bear
can clobber bark off a gum tree.

01:37:53.040 --> 01:37:56.123
There's a man for you,
Jeremiah Johnson.

01:37:56.280 --> 01:38:00.046
I'm half horse, half gator,
and a touch of the earthquake.

01:38:00.200 --> 01:38:03.090
I got the prettiest gal,
fastest horse...

01:38:03.240 --> 01:38:05.641
ugliest dog this side of hell.

01:38:05.800 --> 01:38:08.883
I can outjump, outrun, throw down...

01:38:09.040 --> 01:38:11.725
drag out and whip
any man in all Kentucky.

01:38:15.080 --> 01:38:17.162
How you been, Jeremiah?

01:38:17.320 --> 01:38:20.802
Staying alive, Del.
Ain't that hair I see on your head?

01:38:21.440 --> 01:38:22.566
It sure is.

01:38:22.720 --> 01:38:26.327
I've decided that when I depart
from this life, I'd leave something.

01:38:26.640 --> 01:38:29.325
At least to be remembered
on some man's lodgepole.

01:38:29.760 --> 01:38:31.603
Sound wisdom.

01:38:32.520 --> 01:38:36.002
- Where you headed?
- Same place you are, Jeremiah.

01:38:36.480 --> 01:38:38.084
Hell in the end.

01:38:48.160 --> 01:38:51.926
With all them Injuns after you,
I cannot brag about your campsite.

01:38:53.360 --> 01:38:56.603
You got old and scary
since you growed hair on your head?

01:39:06.440 --> 01:39:10.126
What ever happened to that boy?
The one that didn't talk much?

01:39:14.520 --> 01:39:16.409
Never did take him to Hawley.

01:39:18.440 --> 01:39:20.363
Stayed with that Injun gal
all this time?

01:39:23.400 --> 01:39:25.050
She wasn't no trouble.

01:39:57.240 --> 01:39:59.208
Just like this, one at a time?

01:40:02.920 --> 01:40:04.763
You're lucky they were Crows.

01:40:05.040 --> 01:40:07.327
Apaches would send 50 at once.

01:40:15.160 --> 01:40:16.571
Amongst Injuns...

01:40:16.840 --> 01:40:21.289
a tribe's greatness is figured on
how mighty its enemies be.

01:40:30.880 --> 01:40:32.166
Maybe...

01:40:33.800 --> 01:40:36.610
Maybe you'd best go down to a town...

01:40:37.600 --> 01:40:39.204
get out of these mountains.

01:40:43.040 --> 01:40:45.168
I've been to a town, Del.

01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:56.445
Which way now?

01:40:58.280 --> 01:40:59.770
Don't know.

01:41:02.480 --> 01:41:07.646
I hear the Big Belt in the Blue has
beavers the size of bobcats.

01:41:07.920 --> 01:41:09.160
That so?

01:41:09.920 --> 01:41:11.888
I ain't never trapped either...

01:41:12.400 --> 01:41:14.050
but sure would like to.

01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:20.685
- Jeremiah-
- You will do well, Del.

01:41:21.840 --> 01:41:22.921
You will do well.

01:41:23.680 --> 01:41:26.968
If you don't get in too much trouble
with all that hair.

01:41:28.720 --> 01:41:30.245
Ain't this something?

01:41:31.240 --> 01:41:34.084
I told my pap and mam
I was coming to the mountains...

01:41:34.360 --> 01:41:37.011
to trap and be a mountain man.

01:41:37.560 --> 01:41:39.562
Acted like they was gut-shot.

01:41:39.840 --> 01:41:41.126
Says: "Son..."

01:41:41.440 --> 01:41:44.887
make your life go here.
Here's where the people is.

01:41:45.200 --> 01:41:49.364
"Them mountains
is for animals and savages!"

01:41:50.120 --> 01:41:52.691
I said: "Mother Gue..."

01:41:53.240 --> 01:41:57.040
the Rocky Mountains
is the marrow of the world."

01:41:57.320 --> 01:41:58.890
And by God, I was right.

01:41:59.920 --> 01:42:01.251
Yes, you were.

01:42:06.240 --> 01:42:08.004
Which way you headed, Jeremiah?

01:42:08.640 --> 01:42:10.290
Canada, maybe.

01:42:12.400 --> 01:42:15.768
I hear there's land there
a man has never seen.

01:42:19.360 --> 01:42:21.283
Keep your nose in the wind...

01:42:21.560 --> 01:42:23.483
your eyes along the skyline.

01:42:24.320 --> 01:42:25.970
I will do that, Del Gue.

01:42:30.080 --> 01:42:33.880
I ain't never seen them,
but my common sense tells me...

01:42:34.440 --> 01:42:38.490
the Andes is foothills,
and the Alps is for children to climb.

01:42:39.280 --> 01:42:41.601
Keep good care of your hair!

01:42:42.840 --> 01:42:45.525
These here are
God's finest sculpturings...

01:42:45.840 --> 01:42:48.241
and there ain't no laws
for the brave ones!

01:42:48.520 --> 01:42:50.841
And there ain't no asylums
for the crazy ones!

01:42:51.120 --> 01:42:54.010
And there ain't no churches
except this right here.

01:42:54.280 --> 01:42:55.805
And there ain't no priests...

01:42:56.080 --> 01:42:57.491
excepting the birds!

01:42:57.840 --> 01:43:02.687
I are a mountain man! And I'll
live until an arrow or bullet finds me.

01:43:02.960 --> 01:43:04.803
And then I'll leave my bones...

01:43:05.080 --> 01:43:08.368
on this great map
of the magnificent...

01:46:15.280 --> 01:46:16.770
Right here, mister.

01:46:22.840 --> 01:46:24.126
Where's the crazy woman?

01:46:24.840 --> 01:46:26.251
She's gone.

01:46:28.880 --> 01:46:30.041
Walk over this way.

01:46:40.320 --> 01:46:41.481
Gone where?

01:46:42.520 --> 01:46:43.567
Dead.

01:46:45.880 --> 01:46:47.723
One of them mounds.

01:46:55.360 --> 01:46:56.771
Who are you?

01:46:57.200 --> 01:46:58.884
My name's Qualen.

01:47:00.240 --> 01:47:01.321
I'm a settler.

01:47:02.880 --> 01:47:04.086
Settler.

01:47:16.280 --> 01:47:17.725
What are you going to do?

01:47:46.240 --> 01:47:48.607
I do it when Indians are coming.

01:48:06.160 --> 01:48:07.446
You're him.

01:48:08.760 --> 01:48:10.489
Ain't you him?

01:48:16.240 --> 01:48:17.446
What's this?

01:48:19.080 --> 01:48:20.286
It's for you.

01:48:22.440 --> 01:48:24.408
If you be Johnson.

01:48:26.360 --> 01:48:27.850
A might early, ain't they?

01:48:28.480 --> 01:48:30.881
It ain't a grave like the other.

01:48:32.720 --> 01:48:36.441
More like a statue or a monument.

01:48:43.520 --> 01:48:45.124
We never see them.

01:48:47.880 --> 01:48:49.609
We never even hear them.

01:48:50.480 --> 01:48:54.610
We look and there's e new piece of
bone or hide, or somethings been left.

01:48:55.720 --> 01:48:57.609
So we know they've been here.

01:49:00.960 --> 01:49:02.928
Some say you're dead
on account of this.

01:49:06.000 --> 01:49:09.049
Others say you never will be
on account of this.

01:49:09.440 --> 01:49:10.805
It won't save anything.

01:49:11.640 --> 01:49:12.641
Huh?

01:49:13.640 --> 01:49:16.610
Sending them out to hide
in the corncrib.

01:50:17.680 --> 01:50:19.011
What's on the spit?

01:50:21.240 --> 01:50:22.366
Grown particular?

01:50:25.080 --> 01:50:26.411
Not about feeding.

01:50:27.120 --> 01:50:30.090
Just the company I keep.

01:50:44.080 --> 01:50:46.242
Thank you kindly.

01:50:55.480 --> 01:50:56.925
You've come far, pilgrim.

01:50:59.640 --> 01:51:01.290
Feels like far.

01:51:04.200 --> 01:51:05.929
Was it worth the trouble?

01:51:09.480 --> 01:51:10.606
What trouble?

01:51:21.280 --> 01:51:23.647
You cook good rabbit, pilgrim.

01:51:26.800 --> 01:51:28.006
Cold up here.

01:51:31.840 --> 01:51:35.049
- What brings you up so high?
- Griz.

01:51:35.200 --> 01:51:36.531
Griz.

01:51:36.760 --> 01:51:39.001
Avalanche took the cabin.

01:51:39.280 --> 01:51:41.169
Lost my mule.

01:51:42.200 --> 01:51:44.089
We swum out of it.

01:51:44.440 --> 01:51:45.930
But no matter.

01:51:46.200 --> 01:51:48.601
Weren't no griz left anyway.

01:51:56.400 --> 01:51:59.210
Would you happen to know
what month of the year it is?

01:52:06.080 --> 01:52:08.162
No, I truly wouldn't.

01:52:09.080 --> 01:52:11.048
I'm sorry, pilgrim.

01:52:15.120 --> 01:52:16.565
March.

01:52:17.400 --> 01:52:19.129
Maybe April.

01:52:20.280 --> 01:52:21.725
March, maybe.

01:52:22.040 --> 01:52:24.042
I don't believe April.

01:52:24.920 --> 01:52:26.684
Winter's a long time going?

01:52:28.800 --> 01:52:29.881
Yeah.

01:52:32.360 --> 01:52:34.522
Stays long this high.

01:52:46.320 --> 01:52:50.723
March is a green,
muddy month down below.

01:52:51.440 --> 01:52:53.329
Some folks like it.

01:52:53.600 --> 01:52:55.648
Farmers mostly.

01:53:03.240 --> 01:53:06.005
You have done well
to keep so much hair...

01:53:06.280 --> 01:53:08.487
when so many are after it.

01:53:09.480 --> 01:53:12.484
I hope you will fare well.
