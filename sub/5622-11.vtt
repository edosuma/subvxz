11:14.107 --> 11:16.141
No need to get
self-conscious, buddy.

11:16.143 --> 11:18.677
'Cause we're, uh,
we're good here.

11:18.679 --> 11:20.679
Good.

11:20.681 --> 11:24.249
'Cause I want to be good here.

11:28.354 --> 11:31.656
Something I can
help you with, Pat?

11:31.658 --> 11:34.125
You know, I've been thinking.

11:34.127 --> 11:35.794
Mm-hmm.

11:35.796 --> 11:37.896
And maybe we should go ashore.

11:38.864 --> 11:41.299
Ye... yeah, that'd be great.

11:41.301 --> 11:43.702
You get a chance to have
a peek-a-boo,

11:43.704 --> 11:45.537
see that I'm talking
to you straight.

11:45.539 --> 11:47.472
There's nothing in there
you want to get mixed up in.

11:47.474 --> 11:48.973
Right.
Then we head back out here

11:48.975 --> 11:52.310
for a serious margarita
or three.

11:52.312 --> 11:53.978
Thank you.

11:53.980 --> 11:55.814
Oh, one more thing.

11:55.816 --> 11:58.483
If we are going to do this...

11:58.485 --> 12:00.819
we're going to do it my way.

12:00.821 --> 12:02.887
♪ ♪

12:31.517 --> 12:32.917

12:32.919 --> 12:34.219
Oh, my God,
I made it.

I made it.

12:35.889 --> 12:38.223
(crying):
I made it, I made it.

12:38.225 --> 12:40.692
You done making love
to the ground, son?

12:40.694 --> 12:42.560
'Cause we really need to hustle,
I don't like being on land

12:42.562 --> 12:43.928
any longer than I have to.

12:43.930 --> 12:46.531
No, I-I-I-I understand,
Pat, I, uh...

12:46.533 --> 12:48.566
I can't believe...
I-I wish I could take off

12:48.568 --> 12:50.869
these boots and just feel
the sand between my toes.

12:50.871 --> 12:52.470
Well, I wouldn't risk
doing that, you know,

12:52.472 --> 12:54.205
unless you want to get
the virus and then

12:54.207 --> 12:58.076
seeing every hole of your body
evacuating blood and stool.

12:58.078 --> 13:00.078
Every which way
from here till Sunday.

13:00.080 --> 13:01.579
I'm talking every hole.

13:01.581 --> 13:03.581
Nostrils, eyes, ears...

13:03.583 --> 13:05.116
Yeah, loud and clear,
Pat, okay.
Mouth.

13:05.118 --> 13:06.384
Butthole.
Yeah, you made
your point.

13:06.386 --> 13:07.385
You know, peehole.

13:07.387 --> 13:08.553
It's just amazing to be back

13:08.555 --> 13:10.388
on this beautiful,
beautiful Earth.

13:10.390 --> 13:11.422
I mean, look at th...

13:11.424 --> 13:13.892
And that is a condom.
Oh.

13:13.894 --> 13:15.226
That's what that is.

13:15.228 --> 13:16.561
All right, moving.
Ay-ay-ay-ay.

13:16.563 --> 13:19.164
Okay, yeah, oh.

13:24.570 --> 13:28.673
(ice cream truck music plays)

13:31.076 --> 13:33.411
MIKE:
So what was your, uh,
your top seller?

13:33.413 --> 13:35.480
Choco Tacos.
Mmm.

13:35.482 --> 13:37.749
Chipwiches. Fudgesicles.

13:37.751 --> 13:40.652
You know, I was always
a chocolate banana man, myself.

13:40.654 --> 13:44.255
Wow. Sigmund Freud, uh, he'd
have a field day with you, boy.

13:44.257 --> 13:45.857
I bet he would.

13:45.859 --> 13:50.495
(laughing): Because a banana's
a rough shape

13:50.497 --> 13:52.497
of the male anatomy,
you know.

13:52.499 --> 13:54.265
No, yeah, no,
I got all that, yeah.
Yeah.

13:54.267 --> 13:56.334
Made that connection.
And chocolate
on it.

13:56.336 --> 13:57.435
No, yeah.
On the banana.

13:57.437 --> 13:59.437
Got that one, too. Yeah.
Oh, wow.

13:59.439 --> 14:01.439
No, it was...
the joke wa... was...

14:01.441 --> 14:02.774
was good as
it was, man.
Oh, well.

14:02.776 --> 14:04.442
Didn't need that.
I-I got you.

14:04.444 --> 14:06.511
(music continues playing)

14:09.281 --> 14:13.718
It's just so... quiet.

14:13.720 --> 14:16.554
It's going to sound weird,
but I...

14:16.556 --> 14:20.458
I miss the noise, you know?

14:20.460 --> 14:24.796
The sounds of cars driving,
and horns honking.

14:24.798 --> 14:27.365
People talking, laughing,
radios, like, just...

14:27.367 --> 14:29.767
It's so empty.

14:30.736 --> 14:33.638
I mean,
where are all the bodies?

14:33.640 --> 14:35.707
You want to see bodies,
Spaceman?

14:37.209 --> 14:39.611
I'll show you bodies.

14:41.981 --> 14:46.818
There were big emergency staging
areas like this in every city.

14:47.820 --> 14:50.855
Most people died
in their own homes.

14:50.857 --> 14:52.924
Well, at least they
were around loved ones.

14:52.926 --> 14:54.559
That's not a
horrible way to go.

14:54.561 --> 14:55.994
If you like
coughing up blood

14:55.996 --> 14:57.495
and oozing brain goo
out your ears.

14:57.497 --> 14:58.763
Sure.

14:58.765 --> 15:00.231
Every hole.
Mm-hmm.

15:00.233 --> 15:01.432
Nostrils...

15:01.434 --> 15:02.433
Oh, you don't
have to...

15:02.435 --> 15:03.835
Mouth.
Yeah, right.

15:03.837 --> 15:05.169
Butthole.
Here we go again,
okay.

15:05.171 --> 15:06.170
Peehole.

15:06.172 --> 15:07.772
No, I-I-I get you, Pat.

15:07.774 --> 15:09.340
I'm good on all the holes.

15:09.342 --> 15:11.242
I-I understand the visual,
thank you.

15:11.244 --> 15:12.844
If you didn't
stay home,

15:12.846 --> 15:15.179
you ended up in
places like this.

15:15.181 --> 15:17.582
Although sometimes
you run into a straggler

15:17.584 --> 15:20.451
who ended up neither
here nor there.

15:22.221 --> 15:26.190
And one time, I saw a bag
of bones wearing a bikini.

15:26.192 --> 15:27.258
I'm so sorry.

15:27.260 --> 15:28.726
That must have been awful.

15:28.728 --> 15:30.428
Well, I ain't gonna lie to you.

15:30.430 --> 15:34.065
The sight of a bikini
still does it for me.

15:34.067 --> 15:35.566
Skin or no.

15:35.568 --> 15:39.604
Yeah, I'm more of a
skin guy, myself.

15:39.606 --> 15:42.340
Different strokes.

15:45.210 --> 15:47.412
So...

15:47.414 --> 15:49.981
still think your family's alive?

15:55.120 --> 15:57.188
Let's get the hell
out of here.

15:58.891 --> 16:01.592
Oh, uh, uh
now I got you here.

16:01.594 --> 16:04.495
There is one thing
I've been really itching to do.

16:14.840 --> 16:18.142
(yells)
Forty-love!

16:18.144 --> 16:20.011
Get in the game.

16:21.647 --> 16:23.181
Ace!

16:24.149 --> 16:25.817
Ace!

16:25.819 --> 16:27.285
I wasn't even set.

16:27.287 --> 16:28.319
What do you mean?
You got to be

16:28.321 --> 16:29.487
on your toes, man.

16:29.489 --> 16:30.855
You got to be
on your toes.

16:30.857 --> 16:32.523
That's game.

16:32.525 --> 16:34.292
You owe me
a Lamborghini.

16:34.294 --> 16:35.760
(whoops, laughing)

16:35.762 --> 16:37.028
(ice cream truck music plays)

16:37.030 --> 16:39.597
You a cookie guy?

16:39.599 --> 16:42.700
I got some great cookies
back in the boat.

16:42.702 --> 16:45.770
I mean they're, you know,
they're three years old,

16:45.772 --> 16:47.005
but they're still good.

16:47.007 --> 16:48.172
Uh, y... you know,
I used to date

16:48.174 --> 16:50.975
this Italian girl,
Antonella.

16:50.977 --> 16:53.044
She turned me on to them--
biscottis.

16:53.046 --> 16:55.980
You know, they're stale,
but on purpose.

16:55.982 --> 16:57.015
Hard as a brick.

16:57.017 --> 16:59.484
So was her backside.

16:59.486 --> 17:01.319
I di... well... oh.

17:01.321 --> 17:02.987
(tires squeal)
Okay, hold on here.

17:02.989 --> 17:05.189
What are you doing?
Got to do a
little detour here.

17:05.191 --> 17:07.458
Just got to go back.
I can see the boat from here.

17:07.460 --> 17:08.559
Just-just trust me.

17:08.561 --> 17:10.161
This is a much
better way, man.

17:10.163 --> 17:12.163
Whoa, whoa, hey,
whoa, whoa, what is that?
What?

17:12.165 --> 17:14.832
Th-that billboard up there.
What billboard?

17:14.834 --> 17:17.035
What are you doing?
Will you slow down?
All right, no problem.

17:17.703 --> 17:20.571
Stop the...
Hey! (grunts)

17:20.573 --> 17:22.306
(tires squeal)

17:22.308 --> 17:24.509
Gah...

17:24.511 --> 17:26.544
There's nothing to see!

17:26.546 --> 17:28.813
Oh, oh, my God.

17:28.815 --> 17:30.148
Hey!

17:30.150 --> 17:31.716
Look at that, you see that?
Look!

17:31.718 --> 17:33.651
Alive in Tucson.

17:33.653 --> 17:34.652
That's where I'm from.

17:34.654 --> 17:36.421
That's... I'm from Tucson.

17:36.423 --> 17:37.822
Well, I mean
that's where my family...

17:37.824 --> 17:39.590
(grunts)

17:39.592 --> 17:42.560
You should have stayed
in the truck, bud.

17:48.834 --> 17:51.702
YOUNG TANDY:
Oh, my God, not again.

17:51.704 --> 17:53.871
You are so stupid.

17:53.873 --> 17:56.040
There's only, like,
one other dude,

17:56.042 --> 17:58.676
and you let him
hit you with a wrench.

17:58.678 --> 18:02.447
You beefed it so hard.
You beefed it.

18:02.449 --> 18:05.083
I'm not the one lying
in the middle of the street.

18:05.085 --> 18:07.585
Now get up, fartface.

18:07.587 --> 18:10.021
Come on, you flippin' turd.

18:10.023 --> 18:11.055
I can't get up, Phil.

18:11.057 --> 18:12.390
I can't move.

18:12.392 --> 18:14.058
Well, if you're just
going to quit,

18:14.060 --> 18:16.694
then I'm going
to pee on you.
What?

18:16.696 --> 18:18.062
'Cause that's what
happens to quitters.

18:18.064 --> 18:19.797
They get peed on.

18:19.799 --> 18:21.766
Well, go for it. See if I care.

18:21.768 --> 18:24.102
I'm wearing a friggin'
hazmat suit, you dong.

18:24.104 --> 18:25.770
Fine. Here I go.

18:25.772 --> 18:27.138
No, please, don't,
don't, don't, don't.

18:27.140 --> 18:28.906
Don't look at my ween,
you pervert.

18:28.908 --> 18:30.875
I'm not looking
at your ween.
Three.

18:30.877 --> 18:32.410
Please, just don't do it,
Phil, okay?

18:32.412 --> 18:34.946
